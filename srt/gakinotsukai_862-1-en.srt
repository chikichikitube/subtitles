00:00:00,420 --> 00:00:07,980
The first in the series on Gaki no Tsukai ya Arahende! Chiki Chiki, who is the true leader of Morisanchu? Rubik's Cube in a sauna battle!

2
00:00:10,090 --> 00:00:11,420
Matsumoto, what do you think of this?

3
00:00:10,790 --> 00:00:11,420
Well

4
00:00:11,720 --> 00:00:14,390
T/N: Morisanchu is an all female comedy trio.

5
00:00:11,720 --> 00:00:14,390
Thing is, it seems with Morisanchu...

6
00:00:12,890 --> 00:00:17,260
Downtown

7
00:00:12,890 --> 00:00:17,260
Hamada Masatoshi

8
00:00:12,890 --> 00:00:17,260
Matsumoto Hitoshi

9
00:00:14,390 --> 00:00:17,260
It seems that they don't even know who is the leader anymore

10
00:00:17,430 --> 00:00:21,570
Yamasaki Hosei

11
00:00:17,500 --> 00:00:18,930
Who cares who it is

12
00:00:18,730 --> 00:00:20,030
Originally

13
00:00:20,400 --> 00:00:22,800
It seems they decided that the fat one is the leader

14
00:00:22,300 --> 00:00:23,340
"The fat one"?

15
00:00:23,340 --> 00:00:24,040
Recently though, they've all become fat

16
00:00:24,040 --> 00:00:24,370
Recently though, they've all become fat

17
00:00:24,370 --> 00:00:25,970
Recently though, they've all become fat

18
00:00:25,140 --> 00:00:25,970
That's right

19
00:00:25,970 --> 00:00:29,940
Then they decided the ugly and fat one will be the leader

20
00:00:26,140 --> 00:00:29,940
Cocorico

21
00:00:26,140 --> 00:00:29,940
Endo Shozo

22
00:00:26,140 --> 00:00:29,940
Tanaka Naoki

23
00:00:29,940 --> 00:00:32,410
But all of them are, so...

24
00:00:32,410 --> 00:00:33,310
All of them?

25
00:00:33,110 --> 00:00:34,980
All of them

26
00:00:33,710 --> 00:00:34,980
Yes, I agree

27
00:00:34,980 --> 00:00:36,980
Let's get started then with the introduction!

28
00:00:36,080 --> 00:00:37,020
Yeah!

29
00:00:36,980 --> 00:00:38,980
Morisanchu, welcome!

30
00:00:38,250 --> 00:00:38,980
Come on in!

31
00:00:40,190 --> 00:00:41,420
Oh, but wait...

32
00:00:42,650 --> 00:00:43,820
The atmosphere is so gloomy...

33
00:00:43,820 --> 00:00:45,560
The hell is up with all of you?!

34
00:00:43,990 --> 00:00:51,660
Current leader

35
00:00:43,990 --> 00:00:51,660
Kazuko Kurosawa

36
00:00:43,990 --> 00:00:51,660
Miyuki Oshima

37
00:00:43,990 --> 00:00:51,660
Morisanchu

38
00:00:43,990 --> 00:00:51,660
Recently unable to restrain from fighting

39
00:00:43,990 --> 00:00:51,660
Tomoko Murakami

40
00:00:43,990 --> 00:00:51,660
m 68 404 l 578 404 578 442 68 442

41
00:00:46,390 --> 00:00:47,660
Hard to look at you guys

42
00:00:47,660 --> 00:00:50,830
Seriously though, I can't follow such a leader

43
00:00:51,960 --> 00:00:53,970
I don't even think of you as a leader, you know

44
00:00:54,070 --> 00:00:54,600
In terms of age, she's only 1 year older

45
00:00:54,600 --> 00:00:54,930
In terms of age, she's only 1 year older

46
00:00:54,930 --> 00:00:58,040
In terms of age, she's only 1 year older

47
00:00:56,030 --> 00:00:57,270
Oh really?

48
00:00:57,270 --> 00:00:58,040
Excuse me for a moment

49
00:00:58,600 --> 00:00:58,940
Do you need a leader?

50
00:00:58,940 --> 00:01:01,740
Do you need a leader?

51
00:01:01,040 --> 00:01:01,740
Of course we do

52
00:01:02,340 --> 00:01:04,380
If I'm the leader,

then I think everything would be sorted out!

53
00:01:03,640 --> 00:01:04,540
No way!

54
00:01:04,380 --> 00:01:07,710
If I'm the leader,

then I think everything would be sorted out!

55
00:01:05,540 --> 00:01:07,710
It's not sorted out at all

56
00:01:06,110 --> 00:01:07,710
It ain't sorted out at all

57
00:01:07,580 --> 00:01:08,680
It's almost as if...

58
00:01:08,980 --> 00:01:11,480
Tensions are really high right now, aren't they?

59
00:01:11,920 --> 00:01:14,190
I'm just saying that I can't accept it

60
00:01:14,190 --> 00:01:16,590
I won't accept it if one of these two becomes the leader

61
00:01:16,790 --> 00:01:18,860
Why the hell not? I refuse to accept you

62
00:01:19,120 --> 00:01:22,260
You just happened to get married by chance, right?

63
00:01:20,690 --> 00:01:22,260
My marriage has nothing to do with this!

64
00:01:25,000 --> 00:01:26,360
Oi oi oi!!

65
00:01:26,430 --> 00:01:27,430
Ahhh!

66
00:01:27,430 --> 00:01:28,970
What is with this strength?!

67
00:01:29,370 --> 00:01:30,570
Stop!

68
00:01:33,710 --> 00:01:33,970
What the hell are you doing, you bastard?!

69
00:01:33,970 --> 00:01:34,270
What the hell are you doing, you bastard?!

70
00:01:34,270 --> 00:01:37,140
What the hell are you doing, you bastard?!

71
00:01:34,540 --> 00:01:35,810
Oh no, oh no!!

72
00:01:35,570 --> 00:01:37,140
The hell you doing?!!

73
00:01:37,140 --> 00:01:38,610
I was helping you!

74
00:01:38,210 --> 00:01:39,440
What the hell do you think you're doing?!

75
00:01:39,710 --> 00:01:40,610
Hey!!

76
00:01:45,450 --> 00:01:46,750
What the hell are you doing?!

77
00:01:47,090 --> 00:01:48,120
Hamada!!

78
00:01:48,990 --> 00:01:49,990
What were you doing?

79
00:01:50,160 --> 00:01:52,490
And you, you should oppose him!

80
00:01:51,050 --> 00:01:52,490
It's okay to not be okay with that!

81
00:01:53,330 --> 00:01:57,860
I'd like to settle this, once and for all since you coincidentally got married

82
00:01:57,400 --> 00:01:59,730
My marriage has nothing to do with this!

83
00:01:58,800 --> 00:01:59,330
All because your husband is filthy rich, ain't he?!

84
00:01:59,330 --> 00:01:59,830
All because your husband is filthy rich, ain't he?!

85
00:01:59,830 --> 00:02:01,900
All because your husband is filthy rich, ain't he?!

86
00:02:00,970 --> 00:02:02,170
You shouldn't say things like that...

87
00:02:03,600 --> 00:02:04,700
Stop it!

88
00:02:06,540 --> 00:02:08,210
Kurosawa!

89
00:02:08,610 --> 00:02:14,750
Morisanchu in a destructive crisis!

Gaki no Tsukai to the rescue with a game!!

90
00:02:08,610 --> 00:02:14,750
Morisanchu in a destructive crisis!

Gaki no Tsukai to the rescue with a game!!

91
00:02:08,770 --> 00:02:14,750
Morisanchu, after reaching their ninth year since debut, Gaki no Tsukai will save them from their destructive crisis!

I WANT TO BE THE LEADER!!

98
00:02:27,530 --> 00:02:28,590
So, Matsumoto

99
00:02:28,190 --> 00:02:28,930
Yes!

100
00:02:28,780 --> 00:02:30,680
To start it off, let's explain the rules

101
00:02:30,170 --> 00:02:31,200
Yes yes yes

102
00:02:31,200 --> 00:02:33,200
Over there to the right is a sauna

103
00:02:32,900 --> 00:02:34,470
Ah, a sauna, yes

104
00:02:34,470 --> 00:02:36,290
All three will enter the sauna together

105
00:02:35,130 --> 00:02:44,280
Rules

106
00:02:35,130 --> 00:02:44,280
Whoever finishes their Rubik's Cube the fastest


will become Morisanchu's true leader! (Time limit one hour)

107
00:02:36,300 --> 00:02:42,040
The person who finishes their Rubik's Cube the fastest is the winner

108
00:02:42,040 --> 00:02:44,280
I see!

109
00:02:42,470 --> 00:02:44,280
I understand

110
00:02:44,480 --> 00:02:54,290
Escape Button

111
00:02:44,480 --> 00:02:54,290
If this button is pressed during the battle, that person may


take a break from the sauna as many times as they want!

112
00:02:44,780 --> 00:02:53,620
Narrator: Noda Keiichi

113
00:02:45,420 --> 00:02:49,480
During the battle, there is an Escape Button inside the sauna

114
00:02:49,810 --> 00:02:53,330
If pressed, they may take a break from the sauna as many times as they want

115
00:02:54,420 --> 00:02:57,120
When that happens, we'll support them with all of our might!

116
00:02:56,390 --> 00:03:03,030
In the Case of an Escape


Gaki no Tsukai members will support with all their might!

117
00:02:56,490 --> 00:02:58,020
We will support them!

118
00:02:57,120 --> 00:02:58,020
We will support them

119
00:02:58,020 --> 00:02:59,020
Do your best!

120
00:02:59,520 --> 00:03:00,990
Thank you

121
00:03:00,990 --> 00:03:02,230
Please give it your all

122
00:03:02,230 --> 00:03:03,090
Let's do it

123
00:03:03,090 --> 00:03:04,180
Oshima, are you okay?

124
00:03:04,180 --> 00:03:05,260
You're not okay

125
00:03:04,700 --> 00:03:06,760
Oshima, what happened?

126
00:03:07,730 --> 00:03:08,530
What happened?

127
00:03:08,970 --> 00:03:10,840
We're going to start soon

128
00:03:10,100 --> 00:03:10,840
Come on

129
00:03:10,840 --> 00:03:11,600
It's okay

130
00:03:11,600 --> 00:03:18,610
Kurosawa

131
00:03:11,600 --> 00:03:18,610
Murakami

132
00:03:11,600 --> 00:03:18,610
Oshima

133
00:03:11,670 --> 00:03:18,610
Those who leave the sauna while holding the white flag



will immediately drop out of the competition!

134
00:03:12,450 --> 00:03:15,770
In addition, those who leave the sauna with a white flag

135
00:03:16,010 --> 00:03:18,140
they will immediately be dropped out of the competition!

136
00:03:18,610 --> 00:03:19,540
You never know!

137
00:03:19,540 --> 00:03:20,350
Let's do this!

138
00:03:20,350 --> 00:03:22,080
Yes, let's go!

139
00:03:22,080 --> 00:03:24,250
Rubik's Cube in a Sauna challenge!

140
00:03:24,250 --> 00:03:26,350
I want to be the leader...

141
00:03:24,720 --> 00:03:26,350
Ready...

142
00:03:28,820 --> 00:03:33,430
Rubik's Cube in a Sauna Challenge

143
00:03:28,820 --> 00:03:33,430
Rubik's Cube in a Sauna Challenge

144
00:03:30,420 --> 00:03:32,120
LET'S DO THIS

145
00:03:32,120 --> 00:03:33,430
Yeah!

146
00:03:33,490 --> 00:03:37,300
Who will win this scorching hellish catfight and become the leader?!

147
00:03:33,860 --> 00:03:36,560
A battle to become the leader in this scorching hell,

148
00:03:36,690 --> 00:03:40,000
Who will be victorious in this catfight?!

149
00:03:37,300 --> 00:03:40,600
Sauna temperature: 98° Celsius

150
00:03:37,300 --> 00:03:40,600
T/N: Approximately 208° Fahrenheit.

151
00:03:40,370 --> 00:03:41,300
So damn hot!

152
00:03:41,630 --> 00:03:44,740
It's too hot for even the camera to be in the sauna

153
00:03:42,100 --> 00:03:43,540
This is bad

154
00:03:45,040 --> 00:03:47,540
It doesn't look like they can do it

155
00:03:47,810 --> 00:03:48,540
Right?

156
00:03:49,410 --> 00:03:51,810
They're all sitting a little differently

157
00:03:52,280 --> 00:03:52,940
True

158
00:03:52,940 --> 00:03:54,110
Murakami is the only one sitting on her knees

159
00:03:54,110 --> 00:03:55,210
Oh you're right

160
00:03:55,250 --> 00:03:56,050
Murakami's makeup is thick, isn't it?

161
00:03:56,050 --> 00:03:57,980
Murakami's makeup is thick, isn't it?

162
00:03:57,680 --> 00:03:59,550
Today's makeup is, yes

163
00:03:59,550 --> 00:04:01,150
That is right

164
00:04:01,570 --> 00:04:03,840
Perhaps she thinks a leader should...

165
00:04:03,820 --> 00:04:04,560
Maybe she's expressing her feelings



about wanting to become the leader

166
00:04:04,560 --> 00:04:07,690
Maybe she's expressing her feelings



about wanting to become the leader

167
00:04:06,290 --> 00:04:07,690
I see

168
00:04:08,320 --> 00:04:08,790
Hm?

169
00:04:10,060 --> 00:04:10,960
Gotta quickly line it up

170
00:04:10,960 --> 00:04:12,830
People who are good at it can do it so quickly

171
00:04:12,830 --> 00:04:14,170
She's lost all her focus

172
00:04:15,030 --> 00:04:18,900
She's already drenched in sweat!

173
00:04:18,140 --> 00:04:19,340
What the hell are they doing...

174
00:04:19,690 --> 00:04:21,970
I mean, it seems like they're surprised it's so hot

175
00:04:22,770 --> 00:04:26,140
No no no, it's way too quick to call it, it's too soon!

176
00:04:28,710 --> 00:04:30,320
Oh already...

177
00:04:30,950 --> 00:04:31,920
With every second, she's losing



about three points on her looks

178
00:04:31,920 --> 00:04:32,580
With every second, she's losing



about three points on her looks

179
00:04:32,580 --> 00:04:34,720
With every second, she's losing



about three points on her looks

180
00:04:34,720 --> 00:04:38,460
Although she originally doesn't have much...

181
00:04:37,260 --> 00:04:39,360
Isn't she going into the negatives then?

182
00:04:38,460 --> 00:04:39,360
Right

183
00:04:39,760 --> 00:04:41,060
Oshima is also



starting to lose steam

184
00:04:41,060 --> 00:04:43,560
Oshima is also



starting to lose steam

185
00:04:44,440 --> 00:04:48,100
If you entered a sauna and saw these three, what would you do?

186
00:04:48,810 --> 00:04:53,640
Well, you know, we don't know who will escape the sauna, so we must indiscriminantly help

187
00:04:50,540 --> 00:04:55,940
In the Case of an Escape


Gaki no Tsukai members will support with all their might!

188
00:04:53,640 --> 00:04:55,610
Yes, let's help them!

189
00:04:53,640 --> 00:04:55,610
Yes, let's help with all of our strength!

190
00:04:57,340 --> 00:05:01,010
Here, Murakami isn't looking so good

191
00:05:02,280 --> 00:05:03,620
Her eyes hurt from all the sweat

192
00:05:03,620 --> 00:05:05,280
It got in her eyes, oh dear...

193
00:05:05,280 --> 00:05:06,850
That's gotta hurt

194
00:05:06,790 --> 00:05:08,750
So much sweat!

195
00:05:08,750 --> 00:05:10,960
It's only been about three minutes and a half...

196
00:05:10,960 --> 00:05:13,090
There's still so much time left...

197
00:05:13,990 --> 00:05:15,360
What the hell is this

198
00:05:15,530 --> 00:05:16,160
They look like old ladies from the crappy apartments

199
00:05:16,160 --> 00:05:20,300
They look like old ladies from the crappy apartments

200
00:05:18,760 --> 00:05:20,300
Because there's no air conditioning

201
00:05:21,600 --> 00:05:22,370
Hey!

202
00:05:22,370 --> 00:05:23,300
What is this?!

203
00:05:23,300 --> 00:05:24,840
You guys!!

204
00:05:24,840 --> 00:05:26,370
It'll never end this way so come on!

205
00:05:26,370 --> 00:05:28,670
Come on, do the puzzle!

206
00:05:27,440 --> 00:05:28,670
It's like...

207
00:05:28,670 --> 00:05:29,640
This is uh

208
00:05:28,670 --> 00:05:32,880
T/N: The Ueno Zoo is a zoo in Tokyo. It's known for being pretty rundown.

209
00:05:30,240 --> 00:05:32,880
The Ueno Zoo

210
00:05:33,480 --> 00:05:34,750
Hippos!

211
00:05:34,750 --> 00:05:36,510
They look like hippos!

212
00:05:37,620 --> 00:05:39,120
5 minutes since the start

213
00:05:39,280 --> 00:05:48,990
These three, who don't even normally go to saunas,



are immediately showing expressions of anguish...

214
00:05:39,280 --> 00:05:48,990
These three, who don't even normally go to saunas,



are immediately showing expressions of anguish...

215
00:05:40,750 --> 00:05:43,560
These three, who don't even normally go to saunas,

216
00:05:43,820 --> 00:05:46,730
are immediately showing expressions of anguish

217
00:05:49,330 --> 00:05:52,160
What the hell is this

218
00:05:53,530 --> 00:05:59,300
Murakami escapes!!

219
00:05:59,300 --> 00:05:59,540
Murakami escapes!!

220
00:06:00,340 --> 00:06:01,140
Over here

221
00:06:01,710 --> 00:06:02,970
Come here, Miss Murakami

222
00:06:03,380 --> 00:06:05,480
Come on in

223
00:06:08,380 --> 00:06:12,550
Here you go, here you go

224
00:06:09,280 --> 00:06:11,880
Yeah

225
00:06:11,880 --> 00:06:13,490
How do you feel? Better, right?

226
00:06:12,880 --> 00:06:14,490
Here you go

227
00:06:14,090 --> 00:06:15,850
See, it feels nice

228
00:06:16,650 --> 00:06:17,760
Do you feel refreshed?

229
00:06:17,860 --> 00:06:18,560
How are you?

230
00:06:19,590 --> 00:06:20,560
Are you okay?

231
00:06:21,460 --> 00:06:23,400
There you go

232
00:06:23,400 --> 00:06:25,060
You feel good right?

233
00:06:23,900 --> 00:06:25,260
Okay, back in you go

234
00:06:26,260 --> 00:06:27,570
Alright

235
00:06:27,800 --> 00:06:28,870
Come on!

236
00:06:28,900 --> 00:06:29,830
Back in you go

237
00:06:29,400 --> 00:06:30,400
Looking good

238
00:06:31,340 --> 00:06:33,470
Do your best!

239
00:06:31,840 --> 00:06:33,470
Do your best!

240
00:06:32,300 --> 00:06:33,470
Finish the puzzle!

241
00:06:32,300 --> 00:06:35,640
Murakami all refreshed

242
00:06:33,470 --> 00:06:34,700
Come on!

243
00:06:34,710 --> 00:06:35,810
Let's do it!

244
00:06:36,140 --> 00:06:38,040
Oshima vs Kurosawa

245
00:06:37,180 --> 00:06:41,980
After this, an outburst from the sauna!



Oshima vs Kurosawa, another destined altercation!!

246
00:06:38,440 --> 00:06:41,210
Another destined outburst!

247
00:06:42,410 --> 00:06:47,390
Morisanchu's true leader to be decided!

Rubik's Cube in a Sauna Battle!!

248
00:06:42,410 --> 00:06:47,390
Morisanchu's true leader to be decided!

Rubik's Cube in a Sauna Battle!!

249
00:06:42,650 --> 00:06:44,450
Morisanchu, nine years after their debut

250
00:06:44,720 --> 00:06:47,390
Their true leader will be decided tonight!

251
00:06:48,320 --> 00:06:50,560
You know, they shouldn't push themselves

252
00:06:51,120 --> 00:06:53,120
When they want to get out, they should get out

253
00:06:52,460 --> 00:06:53,120
Of course

254
00:06:53,690 --> 00:06:54,360
Her expression is completely different!

255
00:06:54,360 --> 00:06:57,930
Her expression is completely different!

256
00:06:54,530 --> 00:06:57,060
Very true

257
00:06:55,330 --> 00:06:57,060
Ah yes, she's looking good

258
00:06:57,160 --> 00:06:57,900
She looks refreshed

259
00:06:57,930 --> 00:06:58,560
Her looks went up five points!

260
00:06:58,560 --> 00:07:01,270
Her looks went up five points!

261
00:06:59,060 --> 00:07:00,100
You serious?!

262
00:07:10,340 --> 00:07:14,910
Kurosawa escapes!!

263
00:07:13,080 --> 00:07:14,250
Okay, Kurosawa

264
00:07:19,280 --> 00:07:21,020
Open wide and say, "ah"

265
00:07:21,020 --> 00:07:23,090
Come on, drink up

266
00:07:23,090 --> 00:07:26,260
There you go, there you go

267
00:07:28,890 --> 00:07:34,170
Kurosawa all refreshed

268
00:07:29,290 --> 00:07:31,530
How much do you have done? How many rows?

269
00:07:31,700 --> 00:07:33,630
Not even one row

270
00:07:32,460 --> 00:07:33,630
Ah, not much progress at all

271
00:07:33,630 --> 00:07:35,300
Why the hell won't you say anything?

272
00:07:34,430 --> 00:07:35,300
Yeah

273
00:07:36,840 --> 00:07:40,100
You're looking real pretty

274
00:07:40,270 --> 00:07:43,010
She didn't get prettier at all

275
00:07:43,010 --> 00:07:46,010
10 minutes since the start

276
00:07:43,910 --> 00:07:46,010
We have just passed the 10 minute mark since the start

277
00:07:46,640 --> 00:07:49,380
The three don't look to have any intention of giving up

278
00:07:47,010 --> 00:07:53,280
No one looks even close to retiring

279
00:07:49,810 --> 00:07:53,020
They silently look towards finishing the Rubik's Cube!

280
00:07:53,620 --> 00:07:54,950
Oi oi oi

281
00:07:55,620 --> 00:07:56,220
Murakami's really looking like

282
00:07:56,220 --> 00:07:58,420
Murakami's really looking like

283
00:07:57,090 --> 00:07:58,420
a teddy bear

284
00:07:59,720 --> 00:08:00,690
You're right!

285
00:08:00,290 --> 00:08:02,730
A teddy bear! So cute!

286
00:08:02,730 --> 00:08:03,700
Cute!

287
00:08:04,160 --> 00:08:05,200
Let's support them

288
00:08:05,700 --> 00:08:08,430
Kurosawa is looking a bit...

289
00:08:13,070 --> 00:08:13,910
That side wall is also incredibly hot!

290
00:08:13,910 --> 00:08:14,270
That side wall is also incredibly hot!

291
00:08:13,940 --> 00:08:16,270
The sides are hot!

292
00:08:14,270 --> 00:08:16,270
That side wall is also incredibly hot!

293
00:08:16,270 --> 00:08:18,180
The side wall is hot too!

294
00:08:19,210 --> 00:08:21,310
Murakami isn't looking too good...

295
00:08:22,250 --> 00:08:25,580
Murakami escapes!!

296
00:08:27,620 --> 00:08:29,050
Here she comes! What do you want?

297
00:08:29,250 --> 00:08:30,760
Water! Water!!

298
00:08:30,390 --> 00:08:31,790
Water

299
00:08:30,760 --> 00:08:31,790
We got water over here

300
00:08:31,790 --> 00:08:32,920
Here you go

301
00:08:32,920 --> 00:08:34,490
You can lay down

302
00:08:37,860 --> 00:08:40,060
Go on and eat

303
00:08:38,930 --> 00:08:44,170

304
00:08:38,930 --> 00:08:44,170
Support Item

Cold Somen

305
00:08:38,930 --> 00:08:44,170
T/N: Somen is a thin wheat noodle which is often eaten in the summer with a cold dipping sauce.

306
00:08:39,730 --> 00:08:41,070
We won't tell anyone else!

307
00:08:42,000 --> 00:08:43,540
Don't tell anyone else about this!

308
00:08:43,540 --> 00:08:44,540
You should eat

309
00:08:44,570 --> 00:08:46,300
You're looking so gorgeous!

310
00:08:47,370 --> 00:08:48,840
It's delicious, right?

311
00:08:48,840 --> 00:08:50,940
What's wrong?

312
00:08:49,440 --> 00:08:50,940
What's wrong?

313
00:08:49,770 --> 00:08:50,940
You're gorgeous

314
00:08:51,940 --> 00:08:52,980
Is it good?

315
00:08:53,710 --> 00:08:55,550
Even the inside of your body will cool off

316
00:08:55,250 --> 00:08:56,150
It's good right?

317
00:08:56,150 --> 00:08:56,980
Good, right?

318
00:08:56,920 --> 00:08:58,320
How's it looking?

319
00:08:57,520 --> 00:09:02,820
Oshima escapes!!

320
00:09:01,820 --> 00:09:03,660
All at once! Come over here

321
00:09:04,160 --> 00:09:05,040
Oshima!

322
00:09:05,920 --> 00:09:06,890
Don't look, don't look

323
00:09:07,340 --> 00:09:08,430
Oshima goes here

324
00:09:08,560 --> 00:09:09,360
You guys are rivals

325
00:09:08,960 --> 00:09:09,860
Hurry up

326
00:09:11,120 --> 00:09:13,160
Hurry and get in

327
00:09:18,700 --> 00:09:19,970
Feels good, huh?

328
00:09:21,340 --> 00:09:22,140
Nice!

329
00:09:22,240 --> 00:09:23,810
Here, have some somen

330
00:09:23,810 --> 00:09:24,640
Good

331
00:09:24,740 --> 00:09:26,340
You're so pretty

332
00:09:26,580 --> 00:09:28,310
How is it, Oshima?

333
00:09:29,480 --> 00:09:31,820
Oh wait, this isn't good!

334
00:09:31,020 --> 00:09:31,820
Huh?!

335
00:09:31,820 --> 00:09:32,650
What's wrong?

336
00:09:31,820 --> 00:09:33,350
Not looking good

337
00:09:32,680 --> 00:09:34,190
Kurosawa's not looking good!

338
00:09:35,890 --> 00:09:36,820
Murakami, come on

339
00:09:37,190 --> 00:09:39,490
Murakami is taking her time

340
00:09:37,260 --> 00:09:40,490
Oshima all refreshed

341
00:09:39,260 --> 00:09:40,490
All good, Murakami?

342
00:09:40,560 --> 00:09:43,830
Murakami all refreshed

343
00:09:43,330 --> 00:09:44,230
Looking good

344
00:09:45,800 --> 00:09:47,870
Why are you walking like that?

345
00:09:48,900 --> 00:09:50,100
Why?

346
00:09:49,330 --> 00:09:51,570
Why are you walking like that?

347
00:09:51,570 --> 00:09:53,810
Did something happen?

348
00:09:54,610 --> 00:09:55,540
Come on

349
00:09:55,540 --> 00:09:57,510
T/N: I'm not sure what the censored word is, but it's most likely something vulgar.

350
00:09:55,540 --> 00:09:57,510
Why are you looking like a ***?

351
00:09:58,780 --> 00:10:00,280
All of them look like that

352
00:10:01,280 --> 00:10:05,320
Excuse me, but it looks like all three of them aren't moving...

353
00:10:05,320 --> 00:10:06,650
How's it look?

354
00:10:05,880 --> 00:10:07,890
Oh, well actually, I guess they are moving

355
00:10:08,850 --> 00:10:11,860
Even still, Kurosawa isn't really...

356
00:10:11,860 --> 00:10:13,190
This is okay, right?

357
00:10:13,190 --> 00:10:16,790
Sitting in the same place, just fiddling with the cube... So scary!

358
00:10:17,160 --> 00:10:20,400
Oshima altogether just dropped her cube

359
00:10:20,700 --> 00:10:21,670
Really?

360
00:10:22,970 --> 00:10:23,500
Oh??

361
00:10:24,100 --> 00:10:24,740
Oh?

362
00:10:26,170 --> 00:10:27,010
What's going on?

363
00:10:28,250 --> 00:10:29,010
Is she gonna come out?

364
00:10:29,310 --> 00:10:32,040
Oshima escapes!!

365
00:10:34,010 --> 00:10:34,910
Hurry up over here

366
00:10:34,550 --> 00:10:35,550
You okay?

367
00:10:34,910 --> 00:10:36,110
Good job

368
00:10:36,110 --> 00:10:38,880
Your face, Oshima... Your face is looking real funny

369

The women continues to clash with their stubbornness

390
00:11:14,590 --> 00:11:16,950
They approach the limits of their physical strength

391

397

That's right, she did go in just like that

00:16:18,690 --> 00:16:20,060
Huh?

557
00:16:19,820 --> 00:16:21,330
What're you gonna do?!

558
00:16:21,590 --> 00:16:22,990
If you leave, you'll be quitting the game!

559
00:16:23,360 --> 00:16:24,630
You made it this far!

560
00:16:24,560 --> 00:16:25,400
What're you going to do?!

561
00:16:24,760 --> 00:16:27,400
What will you do?

562
00:16:29,300 --> 00:16:34,570
Murakami quits!!

563
00:16:32,900 --> 00:16:34,570
She left!

564
00:16:36,370 --> 00:16:37,440
Quickly gets into the cool bath

565
00:16:38,340 --> 00:16:40,810
She won't even look this way

566
00:16:39,980 --> 00:16:41,580
So quick to get in

567
00:16:43,380 --> 00:16:44,250
That's enough

568
00:16:44,250 --> 00:16:45,420
Well, can't be helped

569
00:16:45,680 --> 00:16:46,880
Well, yeah

570
00:16:46,350 --> 00:16:48,620
Can't do anything about it, she's already in the water

571
00:16:48,250 --> 00:16:51,420
And there you have it, Murakami is out of the game

572
00:16:51,560 --> 00:16:56,760
44min and 32sec since the start




Murakami's dream to be the leader is wiped out

573
00:16:52,560 --> 00:16:53,360
Murakami

574
00:16:53,520 --> 00:16:55,690
Her dream to become the leader is wiped out

575
00:16:56,930 --> 00:16:59,800
Now, the current leader and Oshima are battling it out

576
00:16:58,230 --> 00:16:59,230
Yes, that's right

577
00:17:00,730 --> 00:17:03,330
There already was some tension between them

578
00:17:04,340 --> 00:17:05,740
True

579
00:17:06,800 --> 00:17:10,570
The atmosphere has gotten worse

580
00:17:08,710 --> 00:17:10,570
Right, before

581
00:17:10,810 --> 00:17:12,210
There was Murakami between them

582
00:17:14,280 --> 00:17:15,510
You gonna fight in there?!

583
00:17:15,380 --> 00:17:17,780
Fighting here is dangerous!

584
00:17:17,350 --> 00:17:19,120
We're also... What?

585
00:17:19,220 --> 00:17:19,880
What is happening?

586
00:17:19,950 --> 00:17:20,550
What's going on?

587
00:17:21,150 --> 00:17:22,650
They're telling the other to take it and leave

588
00:17:22,520 --> 00:17:23,450
I see, I see

589
00:17:23,820 --> 00:17:24,760
"That's your flag"

590
00:17:26,620 --> 00:17:27,630
They just traded places?!

591
00:17:29,030 --> 00:17:30,330
That's it, they traded places?

592
00:17:31,360 --> 00:17:32,200
What the hell

593
00:17:31,960 --> 00:17:33,000
They just traded places, that's it

594
00:17:34,600 --> 00:17:35,170
Huh?

595
00:17:35,500 --> 00:17:38,170
Fighting in there is...

596
00:17:37,500 --> 00:17:40,140
Fighting inside (the sauna)



is dangerous!

597
00:17:39,070 --> 00:17:40,140
Watch out!

598
00:17:41,670 --> 00:17:43,840
Wow, so sluggish

599
00:17:45,380 --> 00:17:47,280
That's all they can manage

600
00:17:46,940 --> 00:17:48,280
They can't stand it

601
00:17:47,580 --> 00:17:48,810
No strength

602
00:17:49,010 --> 00:17:51,250
Get out!

603
00:17:51,250 --> 00:17:53,420
No, you get out!

604
00:17:52,350 --> 00:17:53,880
Get out!!

605
00:17:55,390 --> 00:17:57,350
You hurry and get out!!

606
00:17:55,750 --> 00:17:57,350
Get out!!

607
00:17:57,420 --> 00:17:58,820
Hurry up!!

608
00:17:58,360 --> 00:17:59,460
What is this

609
00:17:59,390 --> 00:18:00,260
So hot!!

610
00:18:00,260 --> 00:18:01,790
Just sweating out crap

611
00:18:05,830 --> 00:18:06,930
Get out there!

612
00:18:06,930 --> 00:18:07,930
Ah!

613
00:18:07,360 --> 00:18:08,630
Bring them out!

614
00:18:08,130 --> 00:18:09,130
Will she kick her out?

615
00:18:09,930 --> 00:18:11,170
Oh, this one!

616
00:18:12,670 --> 00:18:14,610
You can't do that, can't do that

617
00:18:15,710 --> 00:18:17,810
Oshima isn't leaving of her own will

618
00:18:17,580 --> 00:18:19,140
Get out!!

619
00:18:17,680 --> 00:18:18,710
That's right

620
00:18:18,880 --> 00:18:20,180
It's not her free will

621
00:18:20,180 --> 00:18:21,850
Get out!!

622
00:18:21,980 --> 00:18:23,610
That's no good

623
00:18:24,320 --> 00:18:25,920
How many bars have they gone to already?

624
00:18:25,020 --> 00:18:27,590
This is the sixth bar, I think

625
00:18:26,750 --> 00:18:28,250
Is it already six?

626
00:18:28,490 --> 00:18:30,550
"Let's go, I'll pay the next round, damnit!"

627
00:18:32,020 --> 00:18:33,220
Take a look at



Murakami's face, who is just watching this all happen

628
00:18:32,690 --> 00:18:33,960
What do you want?!

629
00:18:33,220 --> 00:18:33,960
Take a look at



Murakami's face, who is just watching this all happen

630
00:18:33,960 --> 00:18:35,930
Take a look at



Murakami's face, who is just watching this all happen

631
00:18:34,130 --> 00:18:35,460
Get the hell out!!

632
00:18:35,460 --> 00:18:36,860
Completely dead

633
00:18:38,300 --> 00:18:39,900
Just acting as a bystander

634
00:18:40,130 --> 00:18:41,730
What the hell?!

635
00:18:42,170 --> 00:18:43,300
What are they doing?

636
00:18:45,140 --> 00:18:49,640
We cannot show what is happening here

637
00:18:56,480 --> 00:18:59,350
After this, Kurosawa goes back into the sauna alone

638
00:18:57,480 --> 00:19:05,760
Kurosawa continues to work on the Rubik's Cube alone



and completes one side

639
00:18:59,480 --> 00:19:01,090
To continue on the Rubik's Cube

640
00:19:01,520 --> 00:19:05,560
She finished one side so we called the battle over!

641
00:19:07,630 --> 00:19:09,590
So Murakami gave up, right?

642
00:19:09,530 --> 00:19:17,740
-----------------
-----------------
-----------------
-----------------

643
00:19:09,530 --> 00:19:17,740
Murakami


Quit

644
00:19:09,760 --> 00:19:11,600
Kurosawa's flag isn't even out

645
00:19:11,700 --> 00:19:17,740
-----------------
-----------------
-----------------
-----------------

646
00:19:11,700 --> 00:19:17,740
Kurosawa


1 side complete

647
00:19:12,230 --> 00:19:14,700
Oshima, your flag is out here already so

648
00:19:14,470 --> 00:19:17,740
-----------------
-----------------
-----------------
-----------------

649
00:19:14,470 --> 00:19:17,740
Oshima


Quit

650
00:19:14,930 --> 00:19:16,770
Oshima, can't help it, right?

651
00:19:17,740 --> 00:19:20,200
I WANT TO BE THE LEADER!

652
00:19:20,340 --> 00:19:21,440
I understand, but

653
00:19:21,140 --> 00:19:22,170
It's kinda...

654
00:19:22,940 --> 00:19:24,410
Hey Hamada

655
00:19:24,640 --> 00:19:25,810
Feeling pretty ambivalent

656
00:19:26,210 --> 00:19:27,810
I get you, but...

657
00:19:31,280 --> 00:19:33,720
If we think of some other way...

658
00:19:32,020 --> 00:19:33,720
But...

659
00:19:34,050 --> 00:19:35,790
We just have to go with this, don't we?

660
00:19:36,250 --> 00:19:38,290
Oshima, are you fine with losing?

661
00:19:38,290 --> 00:19:39,590
No way!

662
00:19:39,990 --> 00:19:41,690
I WANT TO BE THE LEADER!!

663
00:19:41,590 --> 00:19:42,460
Well, that's it

664
00:19:42,230 --> 00:19:45,430
But if you look at reality, you lost

665
00:19:45,600 --> 00:19:46,160
I didn't lose! I want to be the leader!

666
00:19:46,160 --> 00:19:48,600
I didn't lose! I want to be the leader!

667
00:19:47,670 --> 00:19:48,600
No no no

668
00:19:48,930 --> 00:19:51,800
No, look at the reality of it, Kurosawa...

669
00:19:51,900 --> 00:19:55,370
Let's say Kurosawa is the temporary leader!

670
00:19:52,740 --> 00:19:57,040
Temporary, yes. Until next time, Kurosawa will be the leader

671
00:19:56,370 --> 00:19:57,040
Yes

672
00:19:57,410 --> 00:19:59,980
Not the leader! She's not the leader!

673
00:19:59,980 --> 00:20:02,550
Not the leader! She's not the leader!

674
00:20:01,310 --> 00:20:02,810
Where are you even from?!

675
00:20:03,850 --> 00:20:04,880
For a while now

676
00:20:06,080 --> 00:20:09,950
After this,




We will tell you how not to be looked down by [blank]!!

677
00:20:06,220 --> 00:20:08,550
What the hell did you find while in there?!

680
00:20:12,520 --> 00:20:13,960
“When you go to the hair salon,

681
00:20:13,960 --> 00:20:20,260
when asked ‘What would you like to do with your hair color?’, how should I answer without being looked down on by the stylist?”

682
00:20:20,360 --> 00:20:23,030
I don’t get the purpose of this question…

683
00:20:23,030 --> 00:20:25,340
What does this mean?

684
00:20:23,500 --> 00:20:25,970
I don’t really know either

685
00:20:25,340 --> 00:20:28,340
Well, there is a way to not get looked down on

686
00:20:27,870 --> 00:20:30,440
Then let’s go with that, that’s fine

687
00:20:29,870 --> 00:20:34,880
First, before you enter the salon, just kick the door like BAM!

688
00:20:35,250 --> 00:20:38,250
Well, it’s not that kind of “looking down on”...

689
00:20:37,080 --> 00:20:40,380
Even those revolving doors, you gotta go BAM!

690
00:20:40,380 --> 00:20:45,660
And those automatic sliding doors, when there’s a slight opening, you gotta go WHAM!

691
00:20:45,660 --> 00:20:46,660
I see

692
00:20:46,190 --> 00:20:48,530
Once you do that, they’ll be like, “Ahh!”

693
00:20:48,530 --> 00:20:50,760
Their scissors will be shaking like, "Snip snip snip"

694
00:20:50,760 --> 00:20:52,760
It’ll be like that

695
00:20:52,030 --> 00:20:53,700
Well… That is pretty scary

696
00:20:52,900 --> 00:20:55,870
They’ll think, “I would’ve never thought this kind of guy would come to Aoyama!”

697
00:20:53,700 --> 00:20:58,700
T/N: Aoyama is a very posh city in Tokyo.

698
00:20:55,030 --> 00:20:57,430
I see, I see

699
00:20:55,870 --> 00:20:57,370
They’ll be like, “Ahh!”

700
00:20:57,370 --> 00:21:00,370
They’ll be like, “S-s-sir...”

701
00:20:57,430 --> 00:20:59,440
Well, if at first…

702
00:20:59,770 --> 00:21:01,210
I see

703
00:21:01,970 --> 00:21:04,940
Those salon chairs, you can’t sit on them like this

704
00:21:04,610 --> 00:21:06,610
Is that so?

705
00:21:04,940 --> 00:21:09,950
You gotta face towards the back of the chair and go like this

706
00:21:11,080 --> 00:21:14,020
What if they turn the chair around?

707
00:21:12,220 --> 00:21:15,720
Well, if they turn it, then just let them do it and then sit properly

708
00:21:15,990 --> 00:21:18,990
And then after that, what happens with the haircut?

709
00:21:16,920 --> 00:21:19,120
You wanna be higher in popularity

710
00:21:19,120 --> 00:21:22,160
You should get a… Star haircut

711
00:21:20,990 --> 00:21:24,330
That’s enough of that. And after that, you get your haircut, right?

712
00:21:24,330 --> 00:21:27,330
You don’t know anything about a star stylist

713
00:21:27,670 --> 00:21:30,670
You may be a star stylist, but I’m a star at getting a haircut

714
00:21:28,970 --> 00:21:30,470
I get it, so shut up already

715
00:21:30,470 --> 00:21:32,500
So you get the haircut

716
00:21:31,740 --> 00:21:34,740
It’s all about getting the cut

717
00:21:32,500 --> 00:21:33,870
I said that’s enough, damnit! So you get the haircut…

718
00:21:33,870 --> 00:21:36,010
I said that’s enough, damnit! So you get the haircut…

719
00:21:36,010 --> 00:21:38,710
And then they say, “What would you like to do with your hair color?”

720
00:21:37,810 --> 00:21:38,710
Oh, I see

721
00:21:38,880 --> 00:21:41,010
What do you mean by hair color?

722
00:21:41,010 --> 00:21:43,010
Like, how would you like your hair colored?

723
00:21:43,010 --> 00:21:46,080
Do you want your hair colored or not?

724
00:21:44,080 --> 00:21:46,880
So they’ll ask if you want it colored or not?

725
00:21:46,920 --> 00:21:49,790
Then they'll definitely look down on you,

726
00:21:49,790 --> 00:21:52,690
if you awkwardly go, "Yes, please"

727
00:21:52,120 --> 00:21:53,720
So it’s at that point

728
00:21:52,920 --> 00:21:55,830
You have to make sure you’re not looked down on

729
00:21:53,720 --> 00:21:54,490
Right. Well, they finish cutting your hair, right?

730
00:21:54,490 --> 00:21:56,260
Right. Well, they finish cutting your hair, right?

731
00:21:55,830 --> 00:21:58,830
They finish, yeah

732
00:21:56,260 --> 00:21:59,330
Well they’ll say things like, “Ahhh…”

733
00:21:59,760 --> 00:22:02,770
Or, “Ohhh…” They’ll say a lot of things like that

734
00:22:02,370 --> 00:22:04,470
Oh, while they’re cutting?

735
00:22:03,130 --> 00:22:04,770
While they’re cutting

736
00:22:04,770 --> 00:22:09,170
That thing fastened around you here… You know… I will not put that on

737
00:22:09,170 --> 00:22:12,180
That thing

738
00:22:10,010 --> 00:22:12,710
You’re the one who is going to suffer later

739
00:22:12,710 --> 00:22:15,380
All that hair is going to be on you

740
00:22:15,380 --> 00:22:18,580
Well, well, even if I do, it’ll be a V-neck

741
00:22:18,920 --> 00:22:22,020
V-neck??

742
00:22:19,580 --> 00:22:22,450
A V-neck so deep that even your chest hairs show

743
00:22:23,020 --> 00:22:25,990
To about where you can see the chest hair

744
00:22:25,320 --> 00:22:27,660
Well, if the person themselves say it’s okay, then a V-neck…

745
00:22:26,960 --> 00:22:30,130
Can’t have them look down on you

746
00:22:27,660 --> 00:22:30,930
Right, and then they finish cutting and then, “How would you like it?”

747
00:22:30,930 --> 00:22:32,900
First, you go, “Huh?!!” Like that

748
00:22:32,900 --> 00:22:34,730
First, you go, “Huh?!!” Like that

749
00:22:35,130 --> 00:22:38,140
“Huh?!?!” Gotta say it like that

750
00:22:37,970 --> 00:22:39,200
Gotta say it like that?

751
00:22:38,800 --> 00:22:40,070
You gotta say it like that

752
00:22:39,200 --> 00:22:42,170
So that you’re not looked down on

753
00:22:40,070 --> 00:22:43,070
Usually, generally, you shouldn't respond to what they say the first time

754
00:22:43,070 --> 00:22:46,080
Before anything, first you have to go, “Huh?!!” to start

755
00:22:46,580 --> 00:22:47,810
Alright, alright

756
00:22:47,810 --> 00:22:50,810
Then, “What would you like to do with your hair color?”

757
00:22:49,150 --> 00:22:51,050
“Huh?!?!”

758
00:22:51,050 --> 00:22:53,820
Right? First, you gotta start it off like this

759
00:22:53,820 --> 00:22:56,050
You have to. Because you can’t have them look down on you

760
00:22:55,490 --> 00:22:58,490
Yes, that’s right.

761
00:22:56,050 --> 00:22:59,060
It’s no good if you make it seem like you’re actually listening the first time

762
00:22:58,620 --> 00:23:00,490
So you say, “Huh?!” the first time, okay

763
00:23:00,490 --> 00:23:02,230
So, “What would you like to do with your hair color?”

764
00:23:01,890 --> 00:23:04,930
“Huh?!?!”

765
00:23:02,230 --> 00:23:05,430
I’ve had enough of that

766
00:23:06,060 --> 00:23:09,100
Typical

767
00:23:10,130 --> 00:23:13,140
What were you saying?

768
00:23:11,800 --> 00:23:15,640
“Would you like your hair colored or not…” If you’re not, then that’s fine and just let it be

769
00:23:15,440 --> 00:23:17,270
Well first, if you ask me,

770
00:23:17,270 --> 00:23:20,140
it’s no good if I’m still there by the time they ask that

771
00:23:19,680 --> 00:23:21,150
Whoa whoa whoa

772
00:23:20,440 --> 00:23:21,980
If you ask me

773
00:23:21,150 --> 00:23:24,150
What do you mean by this?

774
00:23:21,980 --> 00:23:24,380
First, when they come up to me like this, I’ll just go like this

775
00:23:24,380 --> 00:23:25,350
“Stop that”

776
00:23:25,350 --> 00:23:28,350
“Don’t do that to me,” is what I’d say

777
00:23:28,420 --> 00:23:31,260
You’re the one who came to get a haircut, aren’t you?

778
00:23:31,490 --> 00:23:34,590
When the guy comes with the hairdryer, I’d just pull the plug like that

779
00:23:35,230 --> 00:23:36,660
Because I hate that kind of thing

780
00:23:36,660 --> 00:23:38,660
Because I’m not that kind of person

781
00:23:37,560 --> 00:23:40,560
Wait what?

782
00:23:38,930 --> 00:23:41,830
Because I’m not that kind of person

783
00:23:41,830 --> 00:23:45,300
“Don’t treat me like your customers from yesterday”

784
00:23:45,300 --> 00:23:47,940
“Don’t treat me like that customer over there,” you know that saying

785
00:23:47,940 --> 00:23:51,070
Then after that, just be sloppy drunk

786
00:23:50,810 --> 00:23:53,840
Wait, you’re drunk?

787
00:23:51,380 --> 00:23:54,380
Because I’ve been drinking bourbon

788
00:23:54,450 --> 00:23:57,250
Then you don’t need to get your haircut on that day

789
00:23:57,410 --> 00:24:00,950
Even as they’re cutting, slam it, and then bottoms up

790
00:24:00,280 --> 00:24:01,650
You’re an idiot. You’re an idiot

791
00:24:01,050 --> 00:24:02,090
A shot of tequila. Slam it and then take the shot

792
00:24:01,650 --> 00:24:04,560
You’re an idiot. You’re an idiot

793
00:24:02,090 --> 00:24:04,720
A shot of tequila. Slam it and then take the shot

794
00:24:04,720 --> 00:24:05,890
No way!

795
00:24:06,520 --> 00:24:08,160
I WANT TO BE THE LEADER!!
