00:00:03,010 --> 00:00:06,440
Welcome to Wednesday Downtown,

2
00:00:06,440 --> 00:00:11,560
Tonight we have several presenters

3
00:00:13,250 --> 00:00:15,250
It's the usual one, right?

4
00:00:19,380 --> 00:00:21,340
Here we go

5
00:00:23,240 --> 00:00:28,290
Kotouge, Takahashi and Kasuga!

6
00:00:28,290 --> 00:00:30,280
Twoos!
-A very loud voice

7
00:00:30,280 --> 00:00:31,820
Exactly the same!

8
00:00:31,820 --> 00:00:33,680
Who?
-Where?

9
00:00:33,680 --> 00:00:35,350
Exactly the same

10
00:00:35,350 --> 00:00:37,940
You have a problem with your eyesight

11
00:00:37,940 --> 00:00:40,350
So, all of us today

12
00:00:40,350 --> 00:00:44,930
Bring you the semi-annual "Everybody's Theories" special

13
00:00:44,930 --> 00:00:46,120
Yes

14
00:01:03,440 --> 00:01:06,550
So, the first theory is this

15
00:01:07,740 --> 00:01:13,430
If you see a skinny bald guy in blue leather jacket in a TV station, you'll presume its Kotouge

16
00:01:14,600 --> 00:01:16,480
I guess you do have that style

17
00:01:16,480 --> 00:01:17,620
You do!

18
00:01:17,620 --> 00:01:19,250
Very much so

19
00:01:19,250 --> 00:01:22,020
It's the changing of the seasons
-I understand

20
00:01:22,020 --> 00:01:24,420
It's autumn!

21
00:01:24,420 --> 00:01:26,480
Seeing my leather jacket
-Yes

22
00:01:26,480 --> 00:01:32,430
It turns out that the staff of this program called him "thin blue leather jacket bald head"

23
00:01:32,430 --> 00:01:34,060
Well said

24
00:01:34,060 --> 00:01:36,640
I can't believe i'm thought of like that

25
00:01:36,640 --> 00:01:37,740
Skinny bald head

26
00:01:38,460 --> 00:01:46,090
If you see a skinny bald guy in blue leather jacket in a TV station, you'll presume its Kotouge

27
00:01:46,890 --> 00:01:52,950
Therefore, we prepared the blue leather jacket that Kotouge loves to wear

28
00:01:54,430 --> 00:01:58,590
This will be verified by a similarly bald-headed man, Hyouroku

29
00:01:57,420 --> 00:01:59,770
What a skinny bald guy to get

30
00:01:58,900 --> 00:02:05,370
So, Hyouroku is placed in position

31
00:02:05,370 --> 00:02:06,640
It's Kotouge!

32
00:02:06,640 --> 00:02:08,470
Kotouge

33
00:02:08,920 --> 00:02:11,120
The 1st target is

34
00:02:10,430 --> 00:02:12,540
What are you doing?

35
00:02:13,360 --> 00:02:15,140
Diane's Tsuda

36
00:02:16,080 --> 00:02:18,520
What happens?

37
00:02:25,720 --> 00:02:31,830
Good morning

38
00:02:34,120 --> 00:02:37,260
"Who are you?" is written on his face

39
00:02:37,800 --> 00:02:38,370
Good morning

40
00:02:39,390 --> 00:02:41,400
A greeting was offered

41
00:02:42,920 --> 00:02:44,480
And

42
00:02:46,140 --> 00:02:47,620
A beautiful double-take

43
00:02:52,020 --> 00:02:53,750
It's Kotouge...

44
00:02:54,050 --> 00:02:56,990
Everyone... everyone will fall for it

45
00:02:56,990 --> 00:02:59,620
You can't walk pass Kotouge...

46
00:02:59,620 --> 00:03:05,880
The next target is Asahi Nao

47
00:03:13,510 --> 00:03:15,600
Didn't look

48
00:03:20,660 --> 00:03:22,450
No such impression, right?

49
00:03:21,090 --> 00:03:23,560
She walks straight past

50
00:03:26,190 --> 00:03:28,320
Why does he look so despondent?

51
00:03:26,940 --> 00:03:29,480
The final target is

52
00:03:28,320 --> 00:03:30,760
Looks like he's asking "why!?"

53
00:03:30,760 --> 00:03:34,530
A direct junior from the same firm, Nishkikoi's Watanabe

54
00:03:36,420 --> 00:03:38,180
What happens?

55
00:03:37,220 --> 00:03:39,580
Its possible they'll realize something is up

56
00:03:39,580 --> 00:03:40,850
True

57
00:03:48,310 --> 00:03:49,570
Good morning

58
00:03:49,570 --> 00:03:50,880
Good morning
-Ah!

59
00:03:50,880 --> 00:03:53,710
Sorry
-Good morning

60
00:03:53,710 --> 00:03:56,510
Sorry. Good morning

61
00:03:56,510 --> 00:03:58,850
Good morning. Sorry.
-Good morning

62
00:03:58,850 --> 00:04:00,790
Wrong person, sorry, sorry

63
00:04:00,790 --> 00:04:03,360
No, no

64
00:04:03,360 --> 00:04:05,220
Thanks for your hard work
-Thank you

65
00:04:05,220 --> 00:04:07,390
There's nothing to be sorry about

66
00:04:07,390 --> 00:04:10,830
There is another such person in the world!

67
00:04:16,230 --> 00:04:17,980
No, right?

68
00:04:17,940 --> 00:04:22,370
I mistook him for Kotouge

69
00:04:22,370 --> 00:04:27,080
"I'm sorry for thinking of you as Kotouge just because of your baldness."

70
00:04:27,080 --> 00:04:28,810
I apologize profusely

71
00:04:31,780 --> 00:04:38,690
Seems he's not...

72
00:04:33,240 --> 00:04:34,690
Background

73
00:04:35,610 --> 00:04:39,870
We don't need him in the background!

74
00:04:38,960 --> 00:04:42,090
I don't want to be that kind of person

75
00:04:42,100 --> 00:04:46,480
In summary
Comedians will say hello

76
00:04:50,730 --> 00:04:54,350
Watanabe and I know each other very well

77
00:04:54,350 --> 00:04:57,650
I didn't expect him to fall for it

78
00:04:57,650 --> 00:04:59,440
I'd love to see the fake Kotogue!

79
00:04:59,440 --> 00:05:02,690
What would happen if Kotouge saw it?
-What would happen?

80
00:05:05,550 --> 00:05:07,700
Of course I wouldn't think "This is Kotouge, right?

81
00:05:07,700 --> 00:05:08,780
You'd ignore him?

82
00:05:10,470 --> 00:05:14,800
The next theory chosen by Takahashi is...

83
00:05:15,650 --> 00:05:21,900
The sound effect of cracking bones being played during an orthopedic won't be noticed

84
00:05:21,900 --> 00:05:30,250
Under this massage bed are speakers that will play the effect of sound to verify

85
00:05:31,960 --> 00:05:32,930
It's close

86
00:05:32,930 --> 00:05:34,970
The target is

87
00:05:37,650 --> 00:05:41,860
Sanshiro Komiya, who think this is their private time

88
00:05:42,610 --> 00:05:44,530
Komiya is very perceptive

89
00:05:44,920 --> 00:05:46,790
So dirty

90
00:05:46,530 --> 00:05:48,210
Enough!

91
00:05:48,210 --> 00:05:50,300
So much whining

92
00:05:49,730 --> 00:05:54,600
Next is the orthopedic treatment of the lower back

93
00:05:54,600 --> 00:05:57,580
Will he realize?

94
00:05:58,040 --> 00:05:59,840
I'll shake you gently

95
00:06:00,080 --> 00:06:02,950
What is the sound?

96
00:06:00,170 --> 00:06:01,710
Please breathe in

97
00:06:04,840 --> 00:06:06,300
Very real

98
00:06:07,510 --> 00:06:09,480
Please turn over

99
00:06:09,950 --> 00:06:14,020
We'll do the same as just now

100
00:06:14,590 --> 00:06:16,760
Please breathe in

101
00:06:20,260 --> 00:06:22,430
Please tilt your head

102
00:06:22,590 --> 00:06:25,230
Here we go. Please exhale

103
00:06:30,000 --> 00:06:32,070
Go back

104
00:06:33,840 --> 00:06:37,080
Seems to have missed it completely

105
00:06:38,180 --> 00:06:42,460
The next verification is even bolder

106
00:06:43,550 --> 00:06:45,180
Please relax

107
00:06:45,980 --> 00:06:47,920
Please breathe in

108
00:06:47,920 --> 00:06:48,920
1  2

109
00:06:50,860 --> 00:06:52,290
Now the other side

110
00:06:53,530 --> 00:06:54,990
Please relax

111
00:06:55,530 --> 00:06:56,490
1  2

112
00:06:56,960 --> 00:06:58,300
Okay

113
00:06:57,140 --> 00:06:59,140
No, no, no

114
00:07:00,470 --> 00:07:01,770
Is everything okay?

115
00:07:01,770 --> 00:07:03,940
Eh?

116
00:07:03,940 --> 00:07:05,770
Did it make a noise?

117
00:07:05,170 --> 00:07:07,300
Certainly didn't feel anything

118
00:07:08,010 --> 00:07:10,010
Eh, huh?
-Is everything okay?

119
00:07:10,010 --> 00:07:12,280
And

120
00:07:14,410 --> 00:07:15,210
Here we go

121
00:07:15,210 --> 00:07:16,280
1  2

122
00:07:17,310 --> 00:07:21,460
You'd surely realize

123
00:07:17,850 --> 00:07:18,920
1  2

124
00:07:23,190 --> 00:07:24,890
Eh?

125
00:07:25,660 --> 00:07:27,350
Is everything okay?

126
00:07:28,690 --> 00:07:29,830
What was it just now?

127
00:07:29,830 --> 00:07:31,060
Eh?

128
00:07:33,630 --> 00:07:35,930
Hmm?

129
00:07:40,310 --> 00:07:41,840
What's going on?

130
00:07:41,840 --> 00:07:42,840
Did you realize?

131
00:07:43,170 --> 00:07:44,610
Don't use noises!

132
00:07:46,010 --> 00:07:50,610
The next theory chosen by Takahashi is

133
00:07:51,420 --> 00:07:56,530
Blueberry Farmer Vision Test 2.0

134
00:07:57,310 --> 00:08:03,430
We came to this blueberry farm in Hachioji

135
00:08:08,530 --> 00:08:11,540
Sorry, we are from TBS

136
00:08:11,540 --> 00:08:14,170
Ok.
-Ah...

137
00:08:14,170 --> 00:08:15,910
One wearing glasses!

138
00:08:17,490 --> 00:08:21,910
The next theory chosen by Takahashi is

139
00:08:22,660 --> 00:08:29,960
You can't complain if you  ordered the kaki set and was served persimmons

140
00:08:22,660 --> 00:08:29,960
※Both Japanese oyster and persimmon are pronounced as "kaki"

141
00:08:30,740 --> 00:08:35,640
With the assistance of this canteen

142
00:08:36,580 --> 00:08:44,400
We called out an unsuspecting male as a target

143
00:08:47,410 --> 00:08:50,480
Welcome!

144
00:08:50,480 --> 00:08:53,140
Would you like to order now?

145
00:08:53,140 --> 00:08:56,280
The fried kaki
-good

146
00:08:56,280 --> 00:09:02,790
So, he orders the recommended dish of the day, the fried kaki set

147
00:09:03,680 --> 00:09:11,130
But the dish served is made of persimmons cut into pieces

148
00:09:11,740 --> 00:09:19,200
Coated with wheat flour, egg wash, breadcrumbs and fried

149
00:09:20,010 --> 00:09:23,140
A fried persimmon set like this

150
00:09:24,020 --> 00:09:27,550
Although the appearance is difficult to distinguish

151
00:09:27,550 --> 00:09:30,500
The content is completely different

152
00:09:32,350 --> 00:09:33,790
Sorry for the wait

153
00:09:33,890 --> 00:09:36,590
Here's your order

154
00:09:36,590 --> 00:09:37,960
Please take your time

155
00:09:38,460 --> 00:09:40,340
And then...

156
00:09:45,850 --> 00:09:49,180
First he takes photos

157
00:09:50,220 --> 00:09:52,560
Then beings to eat

158
00:09:59,590 --> 00:10:00,920
Very brittle, right?

159
00:10:06,940 --> 00:10:08,440
Looked at the blackboard

160
00:10:08,440 --> 00:10:11,300
It's time to eat

161
00:10:14,260 --> 00:10:17,610
Then took another picture

162
00:10:18,490 --> 00:10:21,440
Uploaded to Instagram

163
00:10:22,460 --> 00:10:25,940
Fried kaki set: 800 yen

164
00:10:25,940 --> 00:10:29,040
I can't believe it's the kaki of persimmon!

165
00:10:30,350 --> 00:10:33,510
Sees it as an interesting accident in daily life

166
00:10:33,930 --> 00:10:35,620
And then...

167
00:10:38,350 --> 00:10:42,040
Persimmons also have a unique flavor

168
00:10:42,660 --> 00:10:45,080
One after another

169
00:10:46,250 --> 00:10:48,820
All 4 pieces were eaten

170
00:10:50,300 --> 00:10:55,360
The 2nd target is this male

171
00:11:02,890 --> 00:11:04,800
Looking first

172
00:11:04,800 --> 00:11:07,200
It's different with Chinese characters

173
00:11:07,200 --> 00:11:09,230
If the writing is Chinese characters you'd complain

174
00:11:09,230 --> 00:11:12,050
It is written in Katakana

175
00:11:12,050 --> 00:11:14,840
It does make sense

176
00:11:14,030 --> 00:11:22,440
He reads the board 3 times to confirm that the writing is true

177
00:11:23,390 --> 00:11:26,320
Also eaten completely

178
00:11:26,660 --> 00:11:28,400
Sorry to interrupt

179
00:11:28,400 --> 00:11:30,030
Kaki means persimmon?

180
00:11:30,030 --> 00:11:31,470
Yes

181
00:11:31,470 --> 00:11:35,370
Also not complaining about the writing of kaki despite thinking it meant oysters

182
00:11:35,370 --> 00:11:36,970
I didn't think it was a persimmon, which is rare

183
00:11:36,970 --> 00:11:39,280
But...

184
00:11:39,380 --> 00:11:41,720
Also quite delicious

185
00:11:43,380 --> 00:11:47,720
The next theory chosen by Takahashi is

186
00:11:48,480 --> 00:11:52,980
Nowadays, elementary school students do not know the word "sewer"

187
00:11:53,960 --> 00:11:55,860
Do you know dobu?

188
00:11:55,860 --> 00:11:57,660
No idea

189
00:11:57,660 --> 00:11:59,260
What do you think it is?

190
00:11:59,530 --> 00:12:02,130
Is it a type of container?

191
00:12:02,470 --> 00:12:03,970
Do you know dobu?

192
00:12:03,970 --> 00:12:05,700
I don't know
-I don't know

193
00:12:05,050 --> 00:12:06,910
Not anymore?

194
00:12:06,000 --> 00:12:08,320
Plant?

195
00:12:08,470 --> 00:12:09,810
No idea

196
00:12:09,810 --> 00:12:11,340
What do you think it is?

197
00:12:11,340 --> 00:12:13,480
A fish

198
00:12:15,010 --> 00:12:18,270
As expected, no one knows

199
00:12:18,720 --> 00:12:21,550
Do you know dobu?

200
00:12:25,090 --> 00:12:27,220
Mobile App?

201
00:12:28,840 --> 00:12:33,230
The final theory chosen by Takahashi is

202
00:12:33,740 --> 00:12:38,040
Suzumi Muneo is the strongest of reaching-out-of-the-car

203
00:12:38,240 --> 00:12:40,300
What does strongest mean?

204
00:12:41,040 --> 00:12:46,380
Candidates are not obligated to wear seat belts during the election period

205
00:12:46,380 --> 00:12:53,080
And they can wave to voters by poking their body out of the car window

206
00:12:54,110 --> 00:12:56,990
And Suzuki Muneo...

207
00:12:58,810 --> 00:13:03,050
Presents his body in a very unique fashion

208
00:13:10,450 --> 00:13:11,930
And

209
00:13:28,300 --> 00:13:34,620
It can be said that this exceeds the concept of reaching out of the car

210
00:13:37,200 --> 00:13:39,260
So, there we go

211
00:13:39,260 --> 00:13:42,010
Is it possible to do that during the election?

212
00:13:42,010 --> 00:13:43,180
Yes, you can

213
00:13:43,300 --> 00:13:46,100
Does it influence the vote?

214
00:13:46,100 --> 00:13:48,740
If they do it badly it wont help

215
00:13:48,740 --> 00:13:50,440
No problem if its the "head extension party"

216
00:13:50,440 --> 00:13:52,570
Everyone who stretches out of cars

217
00:13:54,530 --> 00:13:59,290
Next is a theory chosen by Kotouge

218
00:13:59,290 --> 00:14:02,690
So, the theory I choose is this...

219
00:14:03,580 --> 00:14:08,260
It's hard to crack shells with a stone on your stomach like a sea otter

220
00:14:08,260 --> 00:14:10,730
That's for sure

221
00:14:10,730 --> 00:14:12,330
Must be a lot of work

222
00:14:12,330 --> 00:14:16,830
This time we tested whether humans can do the same as sea otters

223
00:14:16,830 --> 00:14:20,880
A realistic sea otter tournament was held

224
00:14:20,880 --> 00:14:22,480
Realistic Sea Otter Tournament

225
00:14:22,480 --> 00:14:26,610
I didn't hear about the registration for this tournament

226
00:14:26,610 --> 00:14:28,340
If you heard would you have signed up?

227
00:14:28,340 --> 00:14:29,610
If I heard about it, of course

228
00:14:29,610 --> 00:14:31,600
Realistic sea otter tournament?

229
00:14:31,600 --> 00:14:33,320
But I wouldn't really want to do it in the morning

230
00:14:33,320 --> 00:14:35,130
There is no difference in the afternoon, right?

231
00:14:35,130 --> 00:14:38,100
It's the same in the morning and afternoon, right?

232
00:14:38,980 --> 00:14:46,440
It's hard to crack shells with a stone on your stomach like a sea otter

233
00:14:47,540 --> 00:14:49,950
Realistic Sea Otter Tournament

234
00:14:51,360 --> 00:14:55,940
Participating in the challenge are these 3 comedians

235
00:14:56,990 --> 00:15:04,020
The first person to crack open and eat 5 clams wins

236
00:15:04,870 --> 00:15:10,620
First each choose a stone to crack open the clams

237
00:15:11,720 --> 00:15:14,460
This... will my stomach be okay?

238
00:15:15,360 --> 00:15:19,330
These are very dangerous to use to smash the stomach

239
00:15:20,080 --> 00:15:24,140
Realistic Sea Otter Tournament - Start!

240
00:15:24,140 --> 00:15:26,470
It's begun!

241
00:15:26,470 --> 00:15:28,960
Ogata is going for it!

242
00:15:28,960 --> 00:15:31,300
Smash failed!

243
00:15:31,300 --> 00:15:33,770
The stone hit the stomach

244
00:15:33,770 --> 00:15:36,460
What will happen?

245
00:15:38,370 --> 00:15:40,240
Clams are flying!

246
00:15:40,240 --> 00:15:43,330
Micho smashes!

247
00:15:43,330 --> 00:15:44,920
Ogata is in pain!

248
00:15:44,920 --> 00:15:46,360
This hurts!

249
00:15:46,720 --> 00:15:50,460
Unexpected blows to the stomach

250
00:15:50,460 --> 00:15:53,730
All 3 people lose their spirit in the first move

251
00:15:53,730 --> 00:15:57,640
Not only is it difficult to hit the shells accurately

252
00:15:57,640 --> 00:16:02,810
A slight deviation and the stomach will be hit hard

253
00:16:03,730 --> 00:16:08,480
Michio completely hammered his stomach on the first attempt

254
00:16:10,200 --> 00:16:13,010
And has not yet started again

255
00:16:16,400 --> 00:16:19,090
But 2 minutes after starting...

256
00:16:23,690 --> 00:16:25,500
Success!

257
00:16:26,060 --> 00:16:31,620
Minamikawa hit the center of the shell with a sharp stone and succeeded in breaking it open

258
00:16:31,620 --> 00:16:35,430
Minamikawa opened the 1st shell

259
00:16:35,430 --> 00:16:38,810
How about Ogata? Can he catch up with Minamikawa?

260
00:16:38,810 --> 00:16:41,800
This one... one is out!

261
00:16:41,800 --> 00:16:43,780
Minamikawa gets the 1st piece of shellfish

262
00:16:43,780 --> 00:16:47,620
Then the clams are sent to the iron plate

263
00:16:47,620 --> 00:16:52,120
For safety, the clams are cooked first before being eaten

264
00:16:50,810 --> 00:16:53,080
Really considerate

265
00:16:53,080 --> 00:16:59,080
As Minamikawa eats a hot clam he's one step ahead

266
00:16:59,080 --> 00:17:00,480
Minamikawa is burnt!

267
00:17:01,580 --> 00:17:03,890
Can Ogata catch up?

268
00:17:03,890 --> 00:17:05,580
Cracked open!

269
00:17:05,580 --> 00:17:09,270
Ogata has also succeeded!

270
00:17:09,270 --> 00:17:11,630
He's catching up

271
00:17:11,630 --> 00:17:13,430
How about Michio?

272
00:17:14,280 --> 00:17:16,650
Wait a minute...can't fix it at all

273
00:17:16,950 --> 00:17:18,420
The stomach is no good

274
00:17:18,420 --> 00:17:21,110
Does a flabby tummy absorb the pressure?

275
00:17:21,110 --> 00:17:22,940
My stomach is no good

276
00:17:23,500 --> 00:17:28,750
Ogata is also covered in clam juice

277
00:17:28,750 --> 00:17:31,820
Minamikawa gets his 2nd

278
00:17:31,820 --> 00:17:34,420
Ogata is still trying to get his second one

279
00:17:34,420 --> 00:17:35,970
I have the talent to be a sea otter

280
00:17:35,970 --> 00:17:37,180
Oh, got it!

281
00:17:37,270 --> 00:17:39,600
What is "the talent to be a sea otter"?

282
00:17:39,820 --> 00:17:45,500
The gap between Ogata and Minamikawa is gradually lessening as the competition is fierce

283
00:17:46,470 --> 00:17:48,410
Opened the 3rd one!

284
00:17:48,410 --> 00:17:53,860
And Michio has yet to open one

285
00:17:55,770 --> 00:17:57,380
And then...

286
00:17:59,360 --> 00:18:02,200
On this side, both have just one left

287
00:18:03,380 --> 00:18:06,580
1 more 1 more

288
00:18:06,580 --> 00:18:08,950
Will Ogata be the winner?

289
00:18:08,950 --> 00:18:10,540
Ah! It hit his face!

290
00:18:10,540 --> 00:18:16,890
A flying clam hit his face!

291
00:18:17,820 --> 00:18:19,840
Next to him

292
00:18:20,470 --> 00:18:24,010
It's open, but not quite

293
00:18:24,010 --> 00:18:26,050
Its cracked!

294
00:18:26,050 --> 00:18:27,350
It's cracked. It's close.
-It's already cracked

295
00:18:27,350 --> 00:18:29,700
Then

296
00:18:29,700 --> 00:18:34,060
For some reason, Ogata now places the clam very low

297
00:18:35,120 --> 00:18:38,100
Oh, it's open!

298
00:18:39,130 --> 00:18:41,920
Smashed open!

299
00:18:43,160 --> 00:18:47,030
Ogata smashes the last clam by sheer willpower alone

300
00:18:47,030 --> 00:18:50,740
He's finished eating 5 of them

301
00:18:50,740 --> 00:18:54,790
So the winner of the Realistic Sea Otter Championship is Ogata!

302
00:18:54,800 --> 00:18:56,700
Great!

303
00:18:59,090 --> 00:19:00,120
Damn

304
00:19:00,320 --> 00:19:03,250
It really hurts. I have dark skin so I can't see it

305
00:19:03,250 --> 00:19:06,760
This... should not be broadcast

306
00:19:06,760 --> 00:19:08,710
This is also my own work

307
00:19:08,710 --> 00:19:10,490
Not smashed by others

308
00:19:10,490 --> 00:19:11,960
Yes, although some want to

309
00:19:11,960 --> 00:19:13,130
There's no reason to be hit b y others

310
00:19:13,130 --> 00:19:14,170
Yes, no reason

311
00:19:14,020 --> 00:19:15,480
He's turning red

312
00:19:14,480 --> 00:19:16,570
And then...

313
00:19:16,570 --> 00:19:18,440
Want to see the sea otter model?

314
00:19:18,440 --> 00:19:19,540
Want to see

315
00:19:19,740 --> 00:19:22,070
Want to watch, want to learn!

316
00:19:22,070 --> 00:19:26,640
So lets take a look

317
00:19:28,050 --> 00:19:30,650
The location is very close to the bottom

318
00:19:30,650 --> 00:19:32,920
Eh, wait...
-Hey

319
00:19:33,080 --> 00:19:34,790
Isn't the stone on the bottom?

320
00:19:35,150 --> 00:19:36,390
The stone is below

321
00:19:36,390 --> 00:19:38,920
It's the opposite of us

322
00:19:38,920 --> 00:19:40,060
The stone is placed underneath

323
00:19:40,060 --> 00:19:43,630
It uses the shell and smashes it downwards

324
00:19:43,760 --> 00:19:45,800
Surely more efficient

325
00:19:46,660 --> 00:19:48,530
Sea otters are so smart

326
00:19:47,160 --> 00:19:47,800
No pain either

327
00:19:47,800 --> 00:19:50,330
What is it?
-I don't know

328
00:19:50,330 --> 00:19:53,040
Tell us in advance!

329
00:19:53,040 --> 00:19:55,470
You only said "like a sea otter"

330
00:19:55,470 --> 00:19:59,310
You are the ones who decided to do the opposite

331
00:20:01,310 --> 00:20:03,550
Don't say that

332
00:20:03,550 --> 00:20:07,820
But we should be reminded how to do it

333
00:20:07,820 --> 00:20:14,220
In summary
The sea otter's practice and the imitation is the complete opposite

334
00:20:16,010 --> 00:20:18,770
That is, sea otters are smarter than they are

335
00:20:19,730 --> 00:20:22,410
But Ogata...
-Yes, yes, yes

336
00:20:22,410 --> 00:20:24,840
Very forced

337
00:20:24,840 --> 00:20:26,690
Instead, it's a bit of a buzzkill

338
00:20:26,690 --> 00:20:29,650
Putting in the crotch seems very dangerous

339
00:20:29,650 --> 00:20:32,840
There was no interest here at all

340
00:20:47,960 --> 00:20:52,560
The next theory chosen by Kotouge is

341
00:20:53,330 --> 00:21:00,910
The order of popularity of Robert's members's full names should be Yamamoto Akiyama and Maba

342
00:21:01,640 --> 00:21:05,880
The most well-known surname is presumably Akiyama

343
00:21:05,880 --> 00:21:11,130
With the the most well-known full name presumably being Yamamoto Hiroshi

344
00:21:11,130 --> 00:21:16,120
So, a survey was conducted with 100 people who knew about Robert

345
00:21:16,320 --> 00:21:19,120
Baba, Akiyama and Yamamoto

346
00:21:19,420 --> 00:21:22,590
Do you know their full names?

347
00:21:22,590 --> 00:21:26,400
Well... I know Ryuji Akiyama

348
00:21:26,400 --> 00:21:27,970
Don't know the remaining two?

349
00:21:27,970 --> 00:21:29,070
No idea

350
00:21:29,070 --> 00:21:31,970
Akiyama Baba Yamamoto

351
00:21:31,970 --> 00:21:35,510
Hiroshi Yamamoto

352
00:21:35,710 --> 00:21:36,910
Only know Yamamoto's full name?

353
00:21:36,910 --> 00:21:38,080
Yes

354
00:21:38,180 --> 00:21:41,910
Akiyama always called him by it

355
00:21:42,280 --> 00:21:43,210
After that too...

356
00:21:43,350 --> 00:21:45,150
Ryuji Akiyama

357
00:21:45,150 --> 00:21:46,850
Others I don't know

358
00:21:46,850 --> 00:21:50,990
Hiroshi Yamamoto

359
00:21:50,990 --> 00:21:53,930
Akiyama... eh?

360
00:21:53,930 --> 00:21:57,630
Ryuji Akiyama

361
00:21:57,630 --> 00:22:01,670
Hiroshi Yamamoto

362
00:22:01,670 --> 00:22:03,230
Baba...

363
00:22:03,230 --> 00:22:06,280
I don't know the name of Baba, sorry

364
00:22:07,160 --> 00:22:10,050
The survey results are shown in the figure

365
00:22:10,050 --> 00:22:15,370
The full name of the popularity is shown above

366
00:22:15,370 --> 00:22:18,320
The theory is verified

367
00:22:18,520 --> 00:22:21,270
What is the full name of Baba?

368
00:22:21,270 --> 00:22:23,820
Baba Hiroiki

369
00:22:23,820 --> 00:22:25,960
That's the right answer.
-Really?

370
00:22:25,960 --> 00:22:27,600
I guessed

371
00:22:29,120 --> 00:22:33,600
The next theory chosen by Kotouge is

372
00:22:34,150 --> 00:22:40,970
People whose game of shiritori ends with "n" definitely say "ah"

373
00:22:41,170 --> 00:22:43,370
By the way there is another verification
-Okay

374
00:22:43,970 --> 00:22:47,210
Thank you

375
00:22:47,210 --> 00:22:50,410
Anyway, two person shiritori

376
00:22:50,410 --> 00:22:51,820
2 people?
-Yes

377
00:22:51,820 --> 00:22:53,780
So Asahi will go first.
-Ok

378
00:22:54,280 --> 00:22:56,190
kuruma (car)
-marimo (green algae)

379
00:22:56,190 --> 00:22:58,460
mozuku (sea foam)
-kurumi (walnut)

380
00:22:58,460 --> 00:23:01,390
mikazuki (new moon)
-kitutuki (woodpecker)

381
00:23:01,390 --> 00:23:03,190
kiiro (yellow)
-roba (donkey)

382
00:23:04,260 --> 00:23:05,660
tomato (tomato)
-toire (toilet)

383
00:23:05,660 --> 00:23:06,460
renkon (lotus root)

384
00:23:06,460 --> 00:23:08,300
Ah...

385
00:23:11,140 --> 00:23:12,760
What is this atmosphere?

386
00:23:14,790 --> 00:23:20,580
Before doing a double jump with a jumping rope, you have to first jump normally three times

387
00:23:19,200 --> 00:23:20,580
Equivalent to assisted running

388
00:23:21,310 --> 00:23:23,710
There is another theory that I would like you to test

389
00:23:23,810 --> 00:23:27,450
Please use this jump rope to do a double jump
-Double jump?

390
00:23:27,580 --> 00:23:29,550
At your own pace
-OK

391
00:23:29,550 --> 00:23:30,690
Please.
-I'm ready

392
00:23:35,490 --> 00:23:38,010
First, the normal jump three times
-Three times

393
00:23:40,800 --> 00:23:42,300
End of verification
-What the heck!?

394
00:23:43,950 --> 00:23:48,310
The last theory chosen by Kotouge is...

395
00:23:49,150 --> 00:23:57,280
A "small but heavy item" can be held for about the same amount of time as a "large but light item"

396
00:23:58,710 --> 00:24:00,410
To help us test this theory

397
00:24:02,520 --> 00:24:03,890
What's up!?

398
00:24:04,410 --> 00:24:08,080
We called Westland's Inokichi for a fake program

399
00:24:09,290 --> 00:24:10,630
The fact that its Wednesday Downtown doesn't matter

400
00:24:10,630 --> 00:24:12,600
What the theory is what matters

401
00:24:12,600 --> 00:24:14,430
Anyway, can you take this first?

402
00:24:14,430 --> 00:24:15,970
So scary!

403
00:24:15,970 --> 00:24:16,770
No problem, right?

404
00:24:17,270 --> 00:24:19,040
Wow, it's heavy!

405
00:24:19,140 --> 00:24:23,870
This tungsten block the same volume as iron, but is 2.5 times the weight of iron

406
00:24:23,870 --> 00:24:27,440
It's a rare metal.
-It's very heavy

407
00:24:27,440 --> 00:24:31,950
This is a challenge project to see how long you can last holding it

408
00:24:31,950 --> 00:24:33,120
Oh right

409
00:24:33,120 --> 00:24:35,220
Can you convey to the audience that this super heavy

410
00:24:35,220 --> 00:24:37,040
I don't know if the audience can understand

411
00:24:37,620 --> 00:24:41,460
Because this size of it makes it look very easy to hold

412
00:24:41,950 --> 00:24:48,570
We also didn't tell him about the additional verification of holding a large but light item

413
00:24:49,030 --> 00:24:54,690
So, we set up a fixed camera before leaving

414
00:24:52,220 --> 00:24:53,420
Physical strength is no problem, right?

415
00:24:55,410 --> 00:24:58,010
What's the meaning of this?

416
00:24:57,930 --> 00:25:01,140
Left him alone

417
00:25:01,880 --> 00:25:06,180
This is seriously heavy

418
00:25:06,660 --> 00:25:10,220
Putting the heavy object on one's chest or stomach

419
00:25:10,220 --> 00:25:14,350
Using body parts other than the palm of the hand is prohibited

420
00:25:14,350 --> 00:25:15,840
A good rule

421
00:25:15,890 --> 00:25:19,260
Very painful,  the edge of the metal block is so sharp

422
00:25:20,010 --> 00:25:23,390
And so, an hour and 30 minutes passed

423
00:25:23,970 --> 00:25:26,040
I should eat

424
00:25:28,210 --> 00:25:30,270
Wait a minute, so heavy, ugh

425
00:25:30,270 --> 00:25:32,610
It's too hard to hold the top when you hold it with one hand

426
00:25:33,110 --> 00:25:35,910
My wrist hurts

427
00:25:35,910 --> 00:25:39,520
My wrist is starting to hurt, seriously

428
00:25:39,610 --> 00:25:40,920
The complaints are mounting

429
00:25:40,920 --> 00:25:42,490
This guy can really complain

430
00:25:43,150 --> 00:25:46,390
Even if you try to hold it again, it will be edited out, right?

431
00:25:46,390 --> 00:25:49,090
Last time I searched for chess pieces for so long

432
00:25:49,260 --> 00:25:50,790
Outside on location for 10 hours

433
00:25:50,790 --> 00:25:53,760
Why do I have to spend 10 hours just to be cut out?

434
00:25:54,130 --> 00:25:56,530
Why can't I go to a "Love it!" location shoot and eat delicious food?

435
00:25:56,890 --> 00:26:00,270
Three hours have passed since the start

436
00:26:00,270 --> 00:26:01,390
Complaining so much but still trying hard

437
00:26:01,390 --> 00:26:03,020
This 3 hours is not easy

438
00:26:05,010 --> 00:26:06,380
Ah...

439
00:26:07,560 --> 00:26:08,850
My back hurts too

440
00:26:08,850 --> 00:26:11,680
Not only wrist pain but also finger pain

441
00:26:11,930 --> 00:26:15,650
This is now full-body pain

442
00:26:15,510 --> 00:26:18,790
It's hard, isn't it?
-It's been 4 hours

443
00:26:19,890 --> 00:26:21,330
Ow ow ow

444
00:26:19,990 --> 00:26:22,910
Getting more screen time than expected at least
-Keep going!

445
00:26:21,330 --> 00:26:23,130
OW!

446
00:26:23,130 --> 00:26:24,160
Ah! Ow!

447
00:26:24,700 --> 00:26:26,300
I can't, it hurts!

448
00:26:26,300 --> 00:26:28,500
It really hurts!

449
00:26:28,500 --> 00:26:29,750
Can't hold on any longer

450
00:26:28,890 --> 00:26:30,000
Ouch!

451
00:26:29,740 --> 00:26:30,770
Reached his limit

452
00:26:30,770 --> 00:26:33,150
From start to finish in 4 hours and 2 minutes

453
00:26:33,150 --> 00:26:35,480
A very simple way to end the challenge

454
00:26:39,840 --> 00:26:41,650
It hurts so much...

455
00:26:42,250 --> 00:26:45,750
Isn't this project the most boring Wednesday Downtown project?

456
00:26:46,750 --> 00:26:49,500
If I don't need to bring my manzai clothes can't you just tell me in advance?

457
00:26:49,500 --> 00:26:51,320
Bringing clothes with you is a real pain

458
00:26:51,240 --> 00:26:53,070
A hundred complaints a second

459
00:26:52,320 --> 00:26:56,690
Not knowing there is a follow-up, he returns home for now

460
00:26:57,190 --> 00:26:59,960
Tsk, what the hell is this?

461
00:27:00,800 --> 00:27:02,600
After 3 days

462
00:27:02,000 --> 00:27:04,530
Have to test with the same subject to make it fair, right?

463
00:27:07,140 --> 00:27:09,070
Oh!

464
00:27:10,070 --> 00:27:11,010
What is it?

465
00:27:11,010 --> 00:27:12,980
Enough already, right?

466
00:27:13,910 --> 00:27:20,940
This time, he'll challenge a large and light cardboard box which is half the weight of the tungsten block

467
00:27:24,050 --> 00:27:25,450
It's hard too, isn't it?

468
00:27:26,120 --> 00:27:28,530
What position should I hold this in?

469
00:27:29,000 --> 00:27:34,020
As before, touching with parts other than the palm of the hand is not accepted

470
00:27:34,020 --> 00:27:35,930
Can't use your head

471
00:27:36,030 --> 00:27:38,670
Its so hard to get a hold of

472
00:27:38,670 --> 00:27:40,400
Unbearable...

473
00:27:40,870 --> 00:27:43,610
This seems to be even worse

474
00:27:43,940 --> 00:27:50,150
He tries various positions to hold the cardboard box

475
00:27:48,720 --> 00:27:49,910
Looks like a sculpture

476
00:27:51,010 --> 00:27:52,750
Whoa whoa

477
00:27:55,040 --> 00:27:57,930
But still can't find a suitable position

478
00:27:58,500 --> 00:28:01,310
He brought his clothes with him again

479
00:28:01,790 --> 00:28:06,030
This pose must look really weird, right?

480
00:28:06,030 --> 00:28:08,000
But now only this position is slightly more comfortable

481
00:28:08,440 --> 00:28:11,600
An hour later

482
00:28:16,810 --> 00:28:19,380
Oh no. Tsk!

483
00:28:19,380 --> 00:28:21,080
This is the worst

484
00:28:19,780 --> 00:28:21,060
His manzai clothes got wet, right?

485
00:28:21,590 --> 00:28:24,510
The table, and his stuff, are now soaking wet

486
00:28:25,200 --> 00:28:26,520
It's not going to work

487
00:28:27,310 --> 00:28:28,090
Afterwards

488
00:28:28,090 --> 00:28:29,770
Must want to drink water too

489
00:28:28,720 --> 00:28:30,350
This is the position

490
00:28:31,650 --> 00:28:32,660
Found it?

491
00:28:33,360 --> 00:28:37,090
Like this... but still can't rest

492
00:28:41,360 --> 00:28:43,070
It hurts

493
00:28:43,870 --> 00:28:46,670
The record is 1 hour and 23 minutes

494
00:28:46,670 --> 00:28:49,190
Sadly, the challenge is over

495
00:28:51,580 --> 00:28:53,780
It hurts...

496
00:28:54,180 --> 00:28:56,810
It hurts... tsk

497
00:28:56,980 --> 00:29:00,380
The verification result is that the small and heavy item can be held for longer

498
00:29:00,380 --> 00:29:02,450
So what?

499
00:29:02,010 --> 00:29:03,770
So strict
-Angry

500
00:29:04,190 --> 00:29:05,290
What about my manzai clothes?

501
00:29:05,460 --> 00:29:07,390
You don't need them
-Tsk

502
00:29:07,800 --> 00:29:11,630
In summary
An inefficient location shoot

503
00:29:11,630 --> 00:29:12,620
Interesting

504
00:29:14,290 --> 00:29:16,870
So pissed off
-That guy was making a lot of noise, talking about his clothes

505
00:29:16,870 --> 00:29:20,320
If he's not even willing to bring his manzai clothes, he shouldn't even do manzai

506
00:29:20,320 --> 00:29:22,480
Really doesn't want to bring his performance clothes

507
00:29:22,480 --> 00:29:24,670
What happens if you have to hold poo?

508
00:29:24,670 --> 00:29:26,100
Fresh raw poo

509
00:29:26,100 --> 00:29:28,050
Raw poo?

510
00:29:28,050 --> 00:29:31,550
You have to hold raw poop.
-That's too hard to top

511
00:29:32,060 --> 00:29:34,220
Contrast it with holding a heavy object

512
00:29:35,120 --> 00:29:37,420
Depends on who's it is

513
00:29:37,420 --> 00:29:41,800
Yes, it depends on whether it is yours or your partner's

514
00:29:41,800 --> 00:29:43,170
Partner's poop would be awful

515
00:29:43,890 --> 00:29:47,830
What do you mean by raw poo? Is there such a thing as cooked poo?

516
00:29:47,830 --> 00:29:50,240
It's unprocessed.
-All stool is raw, right?

517
00:29:50,240 --> 00:29:52,640
What does raw poo mean?
-Pure green natural GMO-free poop

518
00:29:52,640 --> 00:29:54,640
What the hell is that face!?

519
00:29:55,470 --> 00:29:56,410
You wanna fight!?

520
00:29:57,380 --> 00:29:58,310
You listening?

521
00:29:59,020 --> 00:30:02,630
Next is the first theory chosen by Kasuga

522
00:30:03,780 --> 00:30:08,850
So, Kasuga's gonna finish it off
-He's finally speaking!

523
00:30:08,850 --> 00:30:12,220
It's true, apart from "Twoos" at the start he hasn't said anything at all

524
00:30:12,220 --> 00:30:14,860
Indeed
-You aren't doing some kind of verification on the sly, are you?

525
00:30:14,860 --> 00:30:18,890
No, I'm not doing a verification, i'm just quiet

526
00:30:19,200 --> 00:30:21,440
I just simply can't think of anything to say

527
00:30:21,440 --> 00:30:24,570
Couldn't think of a single thing to say the whole time

528
00:30:24,570 --> 00:30:27,140
I'm the strong-silent type

529
00:30:27,140 --> 00:30:28,480
So, i'll continue

530
00:30:28,480 --> 00:30:31,440
The theories I have chosen are these

531
00:30:32,680 --> 00:30:36,240
Sons must be able to understand the type of women their father likes

532
00:30:36,970 --> 00:30:39,610
Is that so?
-That's right

533
00:30:40,290 --> 00:30:45,000
Do you know?
-I don't know my father's preferences at all

534
00:30:45,000 --> 00:30:49,760
My father and I don't get along, and we basically don't talk to each other

535
00:30:50,450 --> 00:30:51,530
So it's a mystery to me

536
00:30:51,530 --> 00:30:55,830
That man is more of a mystery to me than anyone else

537
00:30:55,830 --> 00:30:57,980
Can people understand that?
-Absolutely not

538
00:30:57,980 --> 00:31:00,790
How about women?

539
00:31:00,790 --> 00:31:02,430
I know

540
00:31:02,540 --> 00:31:07,340
He likes women who like to carry heavy-looking luggage

541
00:31:07,340 --> 00:31:09,120
What are you talking about?
-What's heavy?

542
00:31:09,120 --> 00:31:12,290
Even if you offer a helping hand, they'll say "no, it's fine"

543
00:31:12,290 --> 00:31:13,250
This low-key kind of vibe

544
00:31:13,250 --> 00:31:15,450
Low-key?

545
00:31:15,990 --> 00:31:23,430
Sons must be able to understand the type of women their father likes

546
00:31:23,430 --> 00:31:25,510
The relationship is a big part of this

547
00:31:23,880 --> 00:31:24,980
So

548
00:31:27,640 --> 00:31:32,250
The challenger this time is Miyashita Kusanagi of Miyashita

549
00:31:33,140 --> 00:31:37,010
My father is a bit special

550
00:31:37,010 --> 00:31:38,980
He is an underground fighter

551
00:31:38,980 --> 00:31:40,240
Underground fighter?
-Yes

552
00:31:40,240 --> 00:31:42,680
At this time, his father...

553
00:31:46,390 --> 00:31:50,580
Sakurai Mac Hideki is 54 years old

554
00:31:51,690 --> 00:31:53,790
He was married once before

555
00:31:53,790 --> 00:31:58,400
And divorced my mother and got married again

556
00:31:58,400 --> 00:32:01,200
So he must have a lot of energy

557
00:32:01,200 --> 00:32:04,110
Is he very popular?
-He should be very popular

558
00:32:04,110 --> 00:32:07,800
Your son Miyashita got married recently, right?
-Yes

559
00:32:07,800 --> 00:32:09,640
Do you know your daughter-in-law?
-Yes, I do

560
00:32:09,810 --> 00:32:12,310
She's a pretty and cute girl

561
00:32:12,310 --> 00:32:15,150
Incidentally, can I ask if your daughter-in-law is your type?

562
00:32:15,150 --> 00:32:17,280
If my daughter-in-law took the initiative to approach me

563
00:32:17,280 --> 00:32:21,380
I'd like it, after all, she's pretty

564
00:32:19,750 --> 00:32:20,780
Stop that!

565
00:32:21,610 --> 00:32:23,950
Isn't that what men are like?

566
00:32:23,950 --> 00:32:29,130
Miyashita's father walks the path of the man

567
00:32:29,840 --> 00:32:33,200
From these five different types of women

568
00:32:33,200 --> 00:32:37,230
He will be asked to choose his favorite

569
00:32:37,630 --> 00:32:40,770
It's hard to choose

570
00:32:41,240 --> 00:32:43,770
For example, the type of woman you like

571
00:32:43,770 --> 00:32:49,550
I mostly find women's eyes to be very attractive

572
00:32:49,680 --> 00:32:51,050
Such a gross scene

573
00:32:52,320 --> 00:32:54,680
You don't want to see your father doing this
-After all, it's your dad

574
00:32:55,180 --> 00:32:56,880
Who's better, I wonder?

575
00:32:56,880 --> 00:32:59,600
Have you chosen?

576
00:32:59,600 --> 00:33:01,760
I've made my choice

577
00:33:01,760 --> 00:33:06,790
After the father has chosen his preferred type of female

578
00:33:08,120 --> 00:33:12,640
The next step is for the son to predict his father's choice

579
00:33:12,970 --> 00:33:16,640
Wow, this is tough

580
00:33:16,870 --> 00:33:18,680
Oh, I'm worried

581
00:33:18,680 --> 00:33:20,980
Which one is it?

582
00:33:20,560 --> 00:33:22,230
What is this vibe, watching his son guess

583
00:33:21,280 --> 00:33:28,890
I personally like D, this kind of innocent feeling

584
00:33:28,890 --> 00:33:34,220
And B, the formal look

585
00:33:34,290 --> 00:33:37,260
I get what he means, sophisticated type

586
00:33:37,830 --> 00:33:40,700
My father should be the opposite of my preference

587
00:33:40,700 --> 00:33:43,060
It should not be the two of them

588
00:33:43,060 --> 00:33:46,670
I think my father likes gyaru type

589
00:33:46,670 --> 00:33:51,980
So I think either A, C or E

590
00:33:51,980 --> 00:33:54,680
I see

591
00:33:54,910 --> 00:33:58,980
In terms of figure, I think E

592
00:33:58,980 --> 00:34:03,320
She's similar to my mother when she was young

593
00:34:03,490 --> 00:34:06,490
My mother used to wear boots like this

594
00:34:07,520 --> 00:34:09,360
She did, it was popular then

595
00:34:09,530 --> 00:34:12,760
I feel like A is also the type my father would like

596
00:34:12,760 --> 00:34:18,440
She has similarities to my mother

597
00:34:18,440 --> 00:34:20,900
Good point

598
00:34:21,200 --> 00:34:24,610
Because the face is the type that my father likes, its possible

599
00:34:24,610 --> 00:34:28,510
But E is also very similar to my mother

600
00:34:28,510 --> 00:34:29,980
What to do?

601
00:34:29,980 --> 00:34:32,550
Which one...?

602
00:34:33,820 --> 00:34:36,050
For the women in the gyaru category

603
00:34:36,050 --> 00:34:41,520
Two have similarities to his mother

604
00:34:41,930 --> 00:34:45,460
So, its time to reveal the results

605
00:34:45,660 --> 00:34:51,430
The female your father chose has his signature on the back of their tag

606
00:34:51,430 --> 00:34:55,770
If there is nothing on the back, the choice is wrong

607
00:34:55,910 --> 00:34:58,510
Go for it!

608
00:34:58,680 --> 00:35:04,880
So which one do you think is your father's favorite type?

609
00:35:05,050 --> 00:35:07,980
The type of women my father likes is...

610
00:35:11,050 --> 00:35:12,560
A

611
00:35:13,890 --> 00:35:18,130
So, please can A peel off the tag

612
00:35:18,460 --> 00:35:20,860
What will be the result?

613
00:35:20,690 --> 00:35:21,180
Please!

614
00:35:21,650 --> 00:35:22,780
Is there a signature?

615
00:35:26,480 --> 00:35:27,840
Right answer!

616
00:35:29,040 --> 00:35:30,810
So happy!

617
00:35:31,200 --> 00:35:34,320
Yes, so happy!

618
00:35:35,780 --> 00:35:37,750
This is a good one!

619
00:35:37,980 --> 00:35:41,020
I got it right, super happy!

620
00:35:39,920 --> 00:35:41,110
You must be super happy!

621
00:35:41,020 --> 00:35:43,220
What kind of feeling is this?

622
00:35:43,490 --> 00:35:47,390
Dad.
-You got it!

623
00:35:48,730 --> 00:35:53,430
She seems like the type found in high class hostess clubs

624
00:35:51,400 --> 00:35:52,290
Where are you manners!

625
00:35:53,430 --> 00:35:55,400
In a place like that?
-Like a club in Ginza

626
00:35:55,570 --> 00:35:57,170
This is a key point

627
00:35:57,170 --> 00:36:00,600
My mother also worked at a hostess club

628
00:36:01,200 --> 00:36:04,240
In summary
He likes hostess clubs

629
00:36:04,240 --> 00:36:07,040
What a rough conclusion.
-But guessed right

630
00:36:07,040 --> 00:36:09,540
Guess correctly
This is the father-son bond

631
00:36:09,550 --> 00:36:11,770
It could also be seen as a very touching theory

632
00:36:11,770 --> 00:36:12,420
Seriously

633
00:36:12,420 --> 00:36:15,080
Indeed, it is still difficult to guess

634
00:36:15,080 --> 00:36:18,590
How can I put it? I don't have such a good relationship with my father

635
00:36:18,590 --> 00:36:20,420
Halfway through I felt like I wanted to cry

636
00:36:20,420 --> 00:36:23,190
But once he said, "Nice, right? Feels like a high-class hostess"

637
00:36:23,190 --> 00:36:25,490
I couldn't help but think "this guy isn't great"

638
00:36:25,490 --> 00:36:26,740
What do you think?

639
00:36:27,330 --> 00:36:29,230
This...

640
00:36:30,280 --> 00:36:34,600
Was it the type of woman that Miyashita likes?

641
00:36:34,610 --> 00:36:36,910
No
-It wasn't? It was the father's?

642
00:36:36,910 --> 00:36:38,470
Miyashita's father
-Huh?

643
00:36:38,470 --> 00:36:40,880
Did you watch it carefully?

644
00:36:40,880 --> 00:36:42,710
I watched but didn't know who was choosing

645
00:36:42,710 --> 00:36:45,080
Because Miyashita was on screen choosing more

646
00:36:45,080 --> 00:36:48,120
So you thought he was picking his own type, right?
-That's right

647
00:36:48,120 --> 00:36:51,080
That's not good.
-I know I'm sorry

648
00:36:51,080 --> 00:36:54,560
It has nothing to do with me, there is no need to hit me, right?

649
00:36:54,560 --> 00:36:56,940
Why is it that the closest to you has to be hit?

650
00:36:59,640 --> 00:37:03,240
The next theory chosen by Kasuga is...

651
00:37:04,620 --> 00:37:08,660
No one really uses the deciliter as a unit of measurement

652
00:37:08,890 --> 00:37:13,630
One tenth of a liter is one deciliter

653
00:37:14,810 --> 00:37:22,220
After learning this point in elementary school, it's rarely heard of again

654
00:37:22,520 --> 00:37:24,190
Incidentally abroad

655
00:37:26,020 --> 00:37:28,760
Juice in Sweden

656
00:37:29,090 --> 00:37:31,730
And Swiss instant soup, etc

657
00:37:32,430 --> 00:37:35,460
It is still used in Europe and other places

658
00:37:36,280 --> 00:37:38,000
Also in Japan

659
00:37:39,800 --> 00:37:43,380
I heard that the unit of measurement this store uses is "deciliter"

660
00:37:43,380 --> 00:37:48,380
Mixed grains here are sold by the "penny"

661
00:37:48,910 --> 00:37:50,490
Really

662
00:37:50,490 --> 00:37:53,490
Here it is used to calculate the amount of small beans sold

663
00:37:53,950 --> 00:37:56,390
Why is the unit of measurement "deciliter" used?

664
00:37:56,390 --> 00:37:59,200
Previously, it was sold as 1 in 2

665
00:37:56,390 --> 00:37:59,200
※The volume unit in Japan is 0.180 kg per unit.

666
00:37:59,200 --> 00:38:01,260
But the shakuhan method is not used anymore

667
00:37:59,200 --> 00:38:01,260
※The Shakukan method is a traditional Japanese metric system derived from Chinese weights and measures

668
00:38:01,260 --> 00:38:04,700
So we had to use the metric system

669
00:38:04,700 --> 00:38:09,860
1 is a little under 2 deciliters

670
00:38:09,160 --> 00:38:10,850
Metrics are very carefully observed

671
00:38:10,900 --> 00:38:12,470
So we use the 2 deciliter

672
00:38:13,000 --> 00:38:17,750
Yes, the Shakuhan method was banned in Showa 34

673
00:38:18,350 --> 00:38:23,200
In terms of the amount sold, the unit of measurement such as the combined and liters can not be used

674
00:38:18,350 --> 00:38:23,200
※The liters mentioned here are the liters of the shakuhan method, and one liter is equal to 1.8039 liters.

675
00:38:23,780 --> 00:38:29,620
So stores began to use sub-liters to measure

676
00:38:29,620 --> 00:38:31,550
So with this kind of container

677
00:38:31,550 --> 00:38:36,670
We made this kind of container of 2 deciliters for trading

678
00:38:37,450 --> 00:38:42,930
Incidentally, deciliters are also used for medical reports and in the medical field

679
00:38:44,680 --> 00:38:48,950
The next theory chosen by Kasuga is...

680
00:38:49,760 --> 00:38:54,170
The 2nd Before doing a double jump with a jumping rope, you have to first jump normally three times

681
00:38:54,170 --> 00:38:55,880
Please do a double jump

682
00:39:01,140 --> 00:39:02,520
Sure enough, the first three jumps

683
00:39:03,950 --> 00:39:05,190
He can jump

684
00:39:06,720 --> 00:39:11,190
The next theory chosen by Kasuga is

685
00:39:07,760 --> 00:39:09,030
It's awesome! Not a single word!

686
00:39:09,030 --> 00:39:09,850
Nothing to say

687
00:39:12,040 --> 00:39:20,880
Drawing Hotei Tomoyasu's face in the same way as Hachi no Hemoji is possible

688
00:39:25,640 --> 00:39:28,240
So, following the rhythm

689
00:39:28,410 --> 00:39:32,650
Let's have a drawing song

690
00:39:32,920 --> 00:39:36,690
Like drawing the old man

691
00:39:36,720 --> 00:39:43,730
Let's draw the face of Hotei

692
00:39:46,630 --> 00:39:51,900
Use these characters twice

693
00:39:52,100 --> 00:39:56,610
Let's draw his face

694
00:39:58,470 --> 00:40:00,240
First, write a "Ho" on the right side

695
00:40:00,240 --> 00:40:02,520
Then write a "Te" in the middle

696
00:40:02,760 --> 00:40:05,190
Write an "I" on the left side

697
00:40:05,190 --> 00:40:07,560
Falling into madness

698
00:40:07,560 --> 00:40:10,080
"To" is his nose

699
00:40:10,080 --> 00:40:13,240
"Mo" is his ear

700
00:40:13,240 --> 00:40:15,920
"Ya" is his hair

701
00:40:15,920 --> 00:40:18,000
Use "Su" to draw eyes

702
00:40:18,000 --> 00:40:19,480
Hug tightly

703
00:40:19,480 --> 00:40:22,120
Hotei Tomoyasu

704
00:40:22,120 --> 00:40:25,810
Like drawing the old man

705
00:40:23,720 --> 00:40:25,270
No, no, no, no, no

706
00:40:25,810 --> 00:40:32,820
We drew the face of Hotei Tomoyasu

707
00:40:32,840 --> 00:40:34,360
Good drawing skills

708
00:40:34,030 --> 00:40:35,480
The best!

709
00:40:36,970 --> 00:40:39,010
This painting can be anyone, right?

710
00:40:36,970 --> 00:40:40,870
The final theory chosen by Kasuga is...

711
00:40:42,550 --> 00:40:50,800
How many points will Shimizu's new imitation get from Noriko Awaya speaking through a psychic?

712
00:40:50,800 --> 00:40:53,430
She used to tell him off a lot

713
00:40:53,630 --> 00:40:56,970
It is already a fixed process

714
00:40:57,570 --> 00:41:01,220
Thank you, friends and viewers!

715
00:41:01,220 --> 00:41:03,340
If you have any theories, please feel free to submit them

716
00:41:03,340 --> 00:41:07,240
We will do this project again in about half a year

717
00:41:07,240 --> 00:41:10,140
This is "Everybody's Theories" special

718
00:41:11,240 --> 00:41:19,360
How many points will Shimizu's new imitation get from the departed Noriko Awaya speaking through a psychic?

719
00:41:22,460 --> 00:41:26,630
Vulgar imitations and dirty imitations

720
00:41:26,630 --> 00:41:32,940
She'd usually score at least an 8

721
00:41:33,720 --> 00:41:34,980
As shown in the theory

722
00:41:38,720 --> 00:41:39,680
Psychic Medium Mikami

723
00:41:39,680 --> 00:41:42,990
No specific explanations were given

724
00:41:42,990 --> 00:41:46,420
First, we ask the psychic Noriko Awaya to get into the body

725
00:41:48,330 --> 00:41:51,320
Three minutes have passed since the spirit was invited to the body

726
00:41:52,460 --> 00:41:55,660
Is it Noriko Awaya?
-Yes.

727
00:41:55,470 --> 00:41:56,380
Here we go

728
00:41:55,660 --> 00:41:57,960
Sorry to trouble you

729
00:41:57,960 --> 00:41:59,430
Today I want you to

730
00:41:59,430 --> 00:42:06,100
Look at someone's parody and score it

731
00:42:06,100 --> 00:42:07,870
Can you help?

732
00:42:08,840 --> 00:42:12,010
Me?
-Yes

733
00:42:12,010 --> 00:42:16,610
I would like to ask Noriko Awaji to rate it

734
00:42:16,610 --> 00:42:19,950
Okay... got it

735
00:42:20,550 --> 00:42:23,680
After receiving permission

736
00:42:26,080 --> 00:42:28,410
We asked her to take a seat at the judges' table

737
00:42:30,500 --> 00:42:31,970
Preparation is complete

738
00:42:32,860 --> 00:42:36,300
What are you feeling right now?

739
00:42:38,970 --> 00:42:48,510
Thanks for letting me be in the spotlight

740
00:42:50,510 --> 00:42:53,350
You are welcome

741
00:42:53,130 --> 00:42:54,550
Who are the other judges?

742
00:42:54,550 --> 00:42:56,660
Then show it quickly!

743
00:42:57,180 --> 00:43:00,420
Shimizu-san's new segment is a parody of Piko Taro-san

744
00:43:00,850 --> 00:43:02,850
Please

745
00:43:04,650 --> 00:43:06,390
POOP

746
00:43:06,390 --> 00:43:09,840
P O O P

747
00:43:09,840 --> 00:43:14,100
P O O P

748
00:43:14,100 --> 00:43:15,810
I have a pen

749
00:43:15,810 --> 00:43:19,120
I have a ass...

750
00:43:19,120 --> 00:43:21,050
Asspen

751
00:43:21,050 --> 00:43:22,640
I have a pen

752
00:43:22,640 --> 00:43:25,730
I have a boobs, an~

753
00:43:25,730 --> 00:43:27,530
Boobspen

754
00:43:27,530 --> 00:43:29,530
Asspen

755
00:43:29,530 --> 00:43:30,980
Boobspen

756
00:43:30,980 --> 00:43:35,720
Unh! Pen boobs ass pen

757
00:43:37,800 --> 00:43:39,020
Seems like she's in a bad mood

758
00:43:40,800 --> 00:43:43,290
Pen boobs ass pen

759
00:43:43,290 --> 00:43:45,570
Pen pen pen pen pen pen pen

760
00:43:45,570 --> 00:43:49,260
It hurts! It hurts when you slap the butt!

761
00:43:53,640 --> 00:43:56,810
Thank you Shimizu

762
00:43:57,080 --> 00:43:59,920
How do you personally rate your performance today?

763
00:43:59,920 --> 00:44:02,490
I think it's full marks

764
00:44:02,750 --> 00:44:06,890
Then let's start scoring
-So nostalgic~

765
00:44:06,890 --> 00:44:10,640
Shimizu's score is...

766
00:44:11,200 --> 00:44:13,160
10分 10分 10分 5分

767
00:44:13,160 --> 00:44:16,150
10分 10分 10分 10分 10分 10 分

768
00:44:16,570 --> 00:44:18,150
Total 95 points

769
00:44:18,510 --> 00:44:21,040
5 points?

770
00:44:24,610 --> 00:44:27,580
My first time to get 5 points

771
00:44:27,740 --> 00:44:30,710
The lowest score I've ever received was a 6...

772
00:44:30,710 --> 00:44:33,020
Why 5?

773
00:44:33,340 --> 00:44:41,920
I think Akira-kun's imitations used to be more spirited

774
00:44:42,390 --> 00:44:45,730
Did Awaya always call you Akira-kun?

775
00:44:45,900 --> 00:44:48,000
It was always "Shimizu-san"

776
00:44:49,070 --> 00:44:52,470
Today was "Akira-kun"

777
00:44:52,460 --> 00:44:59,170
In summary
Awaya's scoring has become stricter since going to heaven

778
00:44:59,180 --> 00:45:00,910
That's what happened.
-She's gotten stricter

779
00:45:03,650 --> 00:45:06,210
What do you think, Shigemori? Which ones did you like the most?

780
00:45:06,210 --> 00:45:09,530
I like the one about the deciliter

781
00:45:09,530 --> 00:45:10,540
Eh?

782
00:45:12,090 --> 00:45:16,710
If you ask an idiot "What unit of measurement do you prefer?" The answer is usually deciliters

783
00:45:16,710 --> 00:45:18,530
What makes you say that?
-Because it sounds cool

784
00:45:19,110 --> 00:45:22,340
What appears in exams is also generally deciliter

785
00:45:22,340 --> 00:45:24,400
Are they usually divided into liters?
-Questions about capacity

786
00:45:24,400 --> 00:45:26,690
If you want to get tattoo, you'd get one of a deciliter, right?
-Yes

787
00:45:29,490 --> 00:45:30,350
Woman!

788
00:45:31,760 --> 00:45:33,520
Woman!
-Sorry

789
00:45:33,520 --> 00:45:34,520
What is this angry mode?

790
00:45:34,520 --> 00:45:36,380
It's because of this woman that I got beaten up

791
00:45:37,610 --> 00:45:39,050
Woman!

792
00:45:39,050 --> 00:45:41,020
Kotouge has problems too!
-Don't do this

793
00:45:41,220 --> 00:45:42,950
Don't call people by their gender

794
00:45:42,950 --> 00:46:14,920
