1
00:00:00,360 --> 00:00:06,070
My life has changed a lot since I did my trial on this show some time ago.

2
00:00:07,040 --> 00:00:09,740
But I got unbelievable information.

3
00:00:10,810 --> 00:00:13,740
What a surprise, there was a man who was even more stingy with money than I was.

4
00:00:14,940 --> 00:00:15,980
His name is...

5
00:00:16,680 --> 00:00:18,250
Hitoshi Matsumoto.

6
00:00:19,080 --> 00:00:20,520
What the hell, asshole!

7
00:00:22,620 --> 00:00:26,990
I hereby request the opening of
the Too Stingy Matsumoto's Trial.

8
00:00:32,990 --> 00:00:35,960
Wait.
What's so stingy about me!?

9
00:00:36,700 --> 00:00:41,800
Is Matsumoto really a stingy bastard?
The truth will be revealed tonight.

10
00:00:55,520 --> 00:01:00,560
The Too Stingy Ochoko-Matsumoto's Trial is now in open session.

11
00:01:00,990 --> 00:01:03,490
Prosecutor and plaintiff group, please enter the court.

12
00:01:24,010 --> 00:01:28,120
Next, the defendant, Hitoshi Matsumoto, please enter the court.

13
00:01:40,600 --> 00:01:42,600
Defendant, please take a seat over there.

14
00:01:51,240 --> 00:01:56,110
Then, the prosecutor should read the complaint as this court is in session.

15
00:01:57,710 --> 00:02:08,790
Hitoshi Matsumoto is a popular comedian who has appeared in many regular shows as a comedian and is ranked high in the billionaire ranking every year.

16
00:02:09,120 --> 00:02:14,800
However, behind the scenes, he has been discovered to be a stingy man to the point that even Director Onuma was taken aback.

17
00:02:15,900 --> 00:02:19,300
His mind is as shallow as an ochoko.

18
00:02:21,700 --> 00:02:25,810
What does that mean?
I don't really understand it when I hear that.

19
00:02:26,770 --> 00:02:29,340
It means your mind is this small and shallow.

20
00:02:30,010 --> 00:02:33,680
It was discovered that he was causing a great deal of trouble to the people around him.

21
00:02:34,020 --> 00:02:38,790
Therefore, I hereby petition for the opening of Too Stingy Ochoko-Matsumoto's Trial.

22
00:02:39,190 --> 00:02:43,760
Understood. We will open the  Too Stingy Ochoko-Matsumoto's Trial.

23
00:02:44,460 --> 00:02:46,790
Prosecutor Hamada, please present your evidence.

24
00:02:47,160 --> 00:02:55,570
There are reports from all sides of the defendant's cheapness.
Please watch this VCR first.

25
00:02:58,570 --> 00:03:02,140
- The Poolside in Saipan Case-

26
00:03:03,650 --> 00:03:09,720
This case happened when Matsumoto went on a trip to Saipan with Yamazaki and a junior.

27
00:03:10,190 --> 00:03:12,850
It occurred on the last day of the trip.

28
00:03:13,250 --> 00:03:17,260
Matsumoto-san! We have three hours before our return flight. Let's do something.

29
00:03:17,260 --> 00:03:19,860
Yeah, what should we do?

30
00:03:20,130 --> 00:03:25,270
Oh, there is a very luxurious pool at a nearby hotel, so let's go swimming there.

31
00:03:25,530 --> 00:03:27,640
Sounds good, let's do that.

32
00:03:28,170 --> 00:03:31,040
Yeah!
Let's swim!

33
00:03:31,770 --> 00:03:36,680
The three of them moved to a nearby hotel and went to the pool.
But...

34
00:03:40,450 --> 00:03:41,320
What?

35
00:03:41,620 --> 00:03:44,350
Hotel security stopped them.

36
00:03:44,750 --> 00:03:51,990
They were told that in order to swim in this pool, they had to pay an admission fee of $20, unless they were staying at the hotel.

37
00:03:52,830 --> 00:03:54,900
Then Yamasaki said,

38
00:03:55,200 --> 00:03:59,130
I guess that's how it is.
It's only $20, let's pay it.

39
00:03:59,230 --> 00:04:01,670
But Matsumoto said,

40
00:04:02,570 --> 00:04:05,610
I don't want to pay it.

41
00:04:06,470 --> 00:04:11,310
It's only $20, and if we don't pay it, we won't be able to enter the pool.

42
00:04:11,310 --> 00:04:14,680
No! Why should I pay it, asshole?

43
00:04:14,680 --> 00:04:18,290
Besides, we swam a lot yesterday, so we've had enough!!

44
00:04:19,750 --> 00:04:25,230
As soon as Matsumoto realized that he had to pay the $20, his attitude suddenly changed and he became furious.

45
00:04:25,560 --> 00:04:28,860
The hotel security guard, who couldn't bear to see it, said

46
00:04:36,500 --> 00:04:40,070
Huh?
That's boring, let's leave.

47
00:04:40,680 --> 00:04:44,450
Yamazaki was about to leave, thinking it was pointless if he was not going to get in the pool.

48
00:04:44,850 --> 00:04:48,020
But Matsumoto was different.

49
00:04:48,980 --> 00:04:50,790
Hell yeahhhh!!

50
00:04:51,090 --> 00:04:54,590
He began sunbathing by the pool.

51
00:04:54,820 --> 00:04:58,460
Oh, it feels so good...!!

52
00:04:58,830 --> 00:05:05,230
Yamasaki reluctantly went along with him and stood by the pool for three hours.

53
00:05:06,630 --> 00:05:08,540
What the hell did you do?

54
00:05:09,940 --> 00:05:12,210
Judge, I'm calling witnesses on this.

55
00:05:12,210 --> 00:05:14,110
Witness, please come to the witness stand.

56
00:05:14,480 --> 00:05:15,480
Yes.

57
00:05:16,280 --> 00:05:18,480
As you know, he appeared in the VCR.

58
00:05:19,610 --> 00:05:22,550
Did he do the same thing as that VCR?

59
00:05:22,550 --> 00:05:26,750
Yes, he did. That was my first trip in a long time.

60
00:05:26,750 --> 00:05:31,830
At the end of the trip, we wanted to swim in the pool but had to pay.

61
00:05:32,430 --> 00:05:36,330
We could not get into the pool for PREE...for free.

62
00:05:36,330 --> 00:05:37,230
Huh?

63
00:05:38,030 --> 00:05:41,340
We could not get into the pool for free.

64
00:05:41,340 --> 00:05:42,870
And hotel security said...

65
00:05:42,870 --> 00:05:45,410
Don't say crazy things today.

66
00:05:46,640 --> 00:05:49,580
That's right!

67
00:05:49,580 --> 00:05:51,850
He is the only one who says crazy things today.

68
00:05:51,850 --> 00:05:54,950
If you do something, my character won't stand out.

69
00:05:55,520 --> 00:05:56,350
That's right.

70
00:05:57,050 --> 00:05:59,920
I'm very aware of that.

71
00:05:59,920 --> 00:06:01,420
What's "PREE"?

72
00:06:02,360 --> 00:06:04,560
"The pool for PREE"?

73
00:06:06,830 --> 00:06:08,530
Well, all right.

74
00:06:08,530 --> 00:06:13,400
We were stopped by hotel security by the pool.
“No, no, no.”

75
00:06:13,400 --> 00:06:15,440
I see, exactly the same thing happened as in that video.

76
00:06:15,440 --> 00:06:21,510
Just one thing to confirm.
You guys had to pay $20 to get in the pool.
That's only about 2,000 yen.

77
00:06:22,080 --> 00:06:30,590
You were going to pay 2,000 yen.
Because you can swim for 3 hours.
You told him you would pay him 2,000 yen to get in the pool.

78
00:06:31,290 --> 00:06:35,460
But he, who has more money than you, sayd, "Why should I pay this?"

79
00:06:36,320 --> 00:06:37,890
This is the point.

80
00:06:38,160 --> 00:06:39,730
Is there anything you want to say?

81
00:06:39,790 --> 00:06:45,730
I want to make something clear.
Let me tell you what happened before that day.

82
00:06:46,030 --> 00:06:48,900
He loves to gamble.

83
00:06:48,900 --> 00:06:50,140
Hama....Yamazaki.

84
00:06:50,140 --> 00:06:50,840
Who?

85
00:06:50,840 --> 00:06:51,970
Yamazaki.

86
00:06:52,170 --> 00:06:53,540
You got a problem!?

87
00:06:56,710 --> 00:06:58,310
Who is Hama-Yamazaki?

88
00:06:58,910 --> 00:07:01,050
You didn't hit me at all.

89
00:07:01,450 --> 00:07:03,250
I just hit you.

90
00:07:03,720 --> 00:07:06,690
I just barely dodged it.
I completely dodged it.

91
00:07:08,360 --> 00:07:09,590
Okay, does he like to gamble?

92
00:07:09,590 --> 00:07:15,230
Yes, he does.
Since the day we arrived in Saipan, this idiot has gambled like a fool.

93
00:07:15,600 --> 00:07:21,940
This time we came to Saipan with the intention of playing in the direct sun.

94
00:07:22,270 --> 00:07:27,280
But this idiot gambled all the time and ended up losing 400,000 yen.

95
00:07:27,280 --> 00:07:29,540
- No, it was 800,000 yen.
- He lost 800,000 yen!

96
00:07:29,540 --> 00:07:33,180
He lost 800,000 yen.
Think about it.

97
00:07:33,180 --> 00:07:39,550
I am his senior,
so I can't let him spend any more money!!

98
00:07:40,660 --> 00:07:44,290
Then why didn't you pay for him?

99
00:07:45,230 --> 00:07:46,430
It's only $20.

100
00:07:46,430 --> 00:07:48,160
That's unrelated!

101
00:07:49,760 --> 00:07:50,970
What the hell.

102
00:07:52,170 --> 00:07:58,940
If you don't want Yamazaki to spend any more money, you just pay.

103
00:07:59,040 --> 00:08:01,840
What can I say about this?
How do I say this?

104
00:08:03,710 --> 00:08:04,750
Why didn't you pay?

105
00:08:04,750 --> 00:08:06,250
Why should I pay?

106
00:08:06,250 --> 00:08:11,890
If he's going to pay, there's nothing wrong with it.

107
00:08:11,890 --> 00:08:16,060
I wanted to say that to the hotel security.
"Do you know who he is?"

108
00:08:16,720 --> 00:08:23,900
"He's Yamazaki, the guy who lost 800,000 yen, and you want him to pay another $20?"

109
00:08:24,570 --> 00:08:27,670
"Give him a drink of water from the pool."

110
00:08:28,140 --> 00:08:33,410
- He lost 800,000 yen. So paying another 2,000 yen won't make a difference, right?
- Yes.

111
00:08:34,410 --> 00:08:37,380
- I wanted to enjoy the last three hours.
- Yeah.

112
00:08:37,550 --> 00:08:41,250
Well, let me tell you this.
What's wrong with me?

113
00:08:42,620 --> 00:08:43,750
What?

114
00:08:44,320 --> 00:08:45,520
What's wrong with me?

115
00:08:47,190 --> 00:08:48,790
That you didn't get in the pool?

116
00:08:49,360 --> 00:08:52,390
Is it wrong for me not to pay my $20?

117
00:08:52,660 --> 00:08:54,460
What's wrong with me?

118
00:08:56,500 --> 00:08:57,970
It's only 6,000 yen.

119
00:08:57,970 --> 00:08:59,300
Shut up, asshole!

120
00:09:02,170 --> 00:09:03,370
He's so mad.

121
00:09:03,370 --> 00:09:06,070
Stop bitching, asshole!

122
00:09:06,670 --> 00:09:08,080
What's wrong with me?

123
00:09:08,680 --> 00:09:10,080
What the hell is he?

124
00:09:11,580 --> 00:09:14,720
I've never had fun on a trip with you!!

125
00:09:15,650 --> 00:09:17,290
We had fun!!

126
00:09:17,290 --> 00:09:18,090
Fuck you!

127
00:09:18,090 --> 00:09:19,290
Fuck you!

128
00:09:19,290 --> 00:09:20,320
Fuck you!

129
00:09:20,320 --> 00:09:22,160
Put him to death!!

130
00:09:22,160 --> 00:09:24,290
I never had any fun with you!!

131
00:09:24,560 --> 00:09:25,730
We had fun!!!

132
00:09:25,730 --> 00:09:26,690
Sit down!

133
00:09:26,690 --> 00:09:27,630
Fuck you!!

134
00:09:27,630 --> 00:09:29,200
We had a lot of fun!!

135
00:09:29,330 --> 00:09:32,400
And wander around unaware that you are dead!!

136
00:09:32,730 --> 00:09:34,170
Yeah, I'll wander around for sure!!

137
00:09:35,840 --> 00:09:37,640
Get sick!

138
00:09:38,310 --> 00:09:39,540
Sick?

139
00:09:40,340 --> 00:09:41,940
- "Get sick"...?
- Don't worry.

140
00:09:41,940 --> 00:09:43,610
Get sick on the weekends!

141
00:09:43,780 --> 00:09:46,380
- I don't want to be sick this weekend.
- Don't worry about it.

142
00:09:48,720 --> 00:09:52,290
- Invitation to Matsumoto's House Case -

143
00:09:54,020 --> 00:10:02,460
This was a few years ago.
It was the first time Miyasako of Ameagari Kesshitai was invited to Matsumoto's house.

144
00:10:02,730 --> 00:10:04,000
Come in.

145
00:10:04,000 --> 00:10:05,830
Thank you for inviting!

146
00:10:09,200 --> 00:10:15,280
Wow! There's a billiard table!
I knew Matsumoto-san was great!

147
00:10:16,080 --> 00:10:18,450
Here we go.

148
00:10:19,050 --> 00:10:24,320
They played billiards for hours.

149
00:10:26,020 --> 00:10:28,720
After a while, Matsumoto said,

150
00:10:29,760 --> 00:10:32,660
I'm hungry, let's get something to eat.

151
00:10:33,060 --> 00:10:34,700
That's nice!

152
00:10:35,300 --> 00:10:40,430
I'm sure Matsumoto-san will treat us to a fancy meal.

153
00:10:41,340 --> 00:10:42,540
But.

154
00:10:43,000 --> 00:10:45,610
Miyasako, go to the convenience store for us.

155
00:10:51,550 --> 00:10:54,020
Get something to eat.

156
00:10:54,020 --> 00:10:58,820
Oh, and don't forget to buy Donbei.
I love them!

157
00:11:01,990 --> 00:11:08,230
Miyasako's hopes were dashed and he reluctantly went to the convenience store.

158
00:11:09,560 --> 00:11:12,130
Then he returned from shopping.

159
00:11:12,570 --> 00:11:15,940
- Sorry to keep you waiting.
- Oh, I've been waiting for you.

160
00:11:15,940 --> 00:11:17,810
Here's 1,000 yen.

161
00:11:19,770 --> 00:11:25,510
Looking at the shopping bags in Miyasako's hands, it was obvious that 1,000 yen was not enough.

162
00:11:25,880 --> 00:11:32,950
But he couldn't tell Matsumoto that he didn't have enough money, so he paid the rest.

163
00:11:33,320 --> 00:11:35,620
Meanwhile, Matsumoto said,

164
00:11:36,260 --> 00:11:40,290
Donbei is the best!
This is the most delicious food in the world!

165
00:11:40,730 --> 00:11:45,070
He kept praising Donbei, saying so.

166
00:11:47,030 --> 00:11:50,000
These horrific cases occurred.
Witnesses, please come in.

167
00:11:57,310 --> 00:11:58,510
Are you all right?

168
00:12:00,510 --> 00:12:01,780
Hang on!

169
00:12:03,380 --> 00:12:08,420
Just tell us what you think.
He won't hurt you.

170
00:12:09,020 --> 00:12:13,290
I became a comedian because I had a dream.

171
00:12:13,930 --> 00:12:19,030
If I work hard in this world, I can become rich.
I can eat a lot of delicious food.
That's what I thought.

172
00:12:19,430 --> 00:12:26,440
But I don't understand why he, now that he is rich, says Donbei  is the best in the world.

173
00:12:26,440 --> 00:12:30,810
Back then, I was married but had no money.

174
00:12:31,450 --> 00:12:33,450
My wife was also very thin.

175
00:12:34,950 --> 00:12:36,750
Hang on!

176
00:12:37,150 --> 00:12:40,250
Let's get the issue straight.

177
00:12:41,290 --> 00:12:49,700
You didn't take delivery or go to a restaurant.
I think that's fine.
It's okay to have those days.

178
00:12:50,500 --> 00:12:52,230
He doesn't blame you for that.

179
00:12:53,370 --> 00:13:01,640
When you saw the food he bought for everyone, didn't you think it cost more than 1000 yen?

180
00:13:03,580 --> 00:13:11,220
First of all, I have something to say.
I don't want to make him think that Downtown Matsumoto is great.

181
00:13:11,520 --> 00:13:15,920
I don't want him to see the arrogance of a comedian.

182
00:13:15,920 --> 00:13:20,490
I want to treat him like an ordinary person

183
00:13:20,490 --> 00:13:24,200
I dont want him to think im above him.

184
00:13:24,200 --> 00:13:31,470
I know how you feel.
That's why you told him to go to the convenience store.
I know exactly how you feel.

185
00:13:31,510 --> 00:13:35,110
- But you also knew that your junior was paying for it, didn't you?
- Yes.

186
00:13:35,110 --> 00:13:39,350
- You didn't give him money to go shopping, did you?
- Right.

187
00:13:39,350 --> 00:13:41,450
He came back with a lot of stuff.

188
00:13:41,680 --> 00:13:45,550
You didn't notice he paid more than 1000 yen?

189
00:13:46,650 --> 00:13:47,690
Simply put,

190
00:13:47,820 --> 00:13:48,820
I had noticed it.

191
00:13:50,960 --> 00:13:56,860
- Did you notice that what he bought cost about 3,000 yen?
- Yes.

192
00:13:57,160 --> 00:13:58,830
And how much money did you give him?

193
00:13:58,830 --> 00:14:01,470
I gave him about 1,000 yen.

194
00:14:01,470 --> 00:14:04,940
Oh, you're short 2,000 yen.
Why is that?

195
00:14:04,940 --> 00:14:11,050
Meanwhile, I was still talking with Miyasako.

196
00:14:11,510 --> 00:14:18,820
I gave him tens of millions of yen in invisible money.

197
00:14:20,120 --> 00:14:22,920
He must have stolen a lot of skills from me.

198
00:14:23,220 --> 00:14:25,830
"In this situation, say like this."
"In this situation, do this."

199
00:14:27,030 --> 00:14:31,530
I taught Miyasako the secrets of comedy and how to do comedy.

200
00:14:31,730 --> 00:14:34,900
If you think of it as a tuition fee, a few thousand yen is a small price to pay!

201
00:14:35,270 --> 00:14:36,840
Hey, baldy.

202
00:14:40,010 --> 00:14:43,640
Witness, be careful about your language.

203
00:14:43,810 --> 00:14:44,950
Sorry.

204
00:14:45,480 --> 00:14:48,550
This was quite a while ago,

205
00:14:49,550 --> 00:14:50,680
But you have to pay me.

206
00:14:53,550 --> 00:14:54,260
Why?

207
00:14:54,260 --> 00:14:57,460
Because I want to give my wife a good meal...!

208
00:14:59,460 --> 00:15:02,160
- Can I say something unrelated?
- Okay.

209
00:15:02,260 --> 00:15:04,370
Can't your buddy speak?

210
00:15:09,340 --> 00:15:12,270
By the way, defendant, no, witness.

211
00:15:12,840 --> 00:15:14,210
Was he there?

212
00:15:14,440 --> 00:15:15,780
Yes, he was.

213
00:15:16,240 --> 00:15:17,180
Did you see it too?

214
00:15:17,180 --> 00:15:18,250
I don't know.

215
00:15:23,220 --> 00:15:26,790
- He was there!
- Yes, he was!
- We were all there!

216
00:15:26,790 --> 00:15:27,920
I was there too!

217
00:15:28,290 --> 00:15:30,220
- I don't know.
- Why don't you know?

218
00:15:30,860 --> 00:15:32,430
That didn't happen, did it?

219
00:15:32,630 --> 00:15:34,060
I think so.

220
00:15:37,130 --> 00:15:40,870
- Is it true that you paid 2,000 yen on his behalf?
- Yes!

221
00:15:41,000 --> 00:15:45,640
But the defendant says it was a tuition fee.
What do you think about that?

222
00:15:45,640 --> 00:15:48,810
I have NEVER learned anything from this guy!

223
00:15:49,280 --> 00:15:50,010
I see.

224
00:15:50,010 --> 00:15:52,080
There are many things that he has taken away from me!

225
00:15:52,750 --> 00:15:54,280
I have never learned anything from this guy.

226
00:15:54,280 --> 00:15:55,150
I see.

227
00:15:55,150 --> 00:16:03,890
What's wrong with me!?
When I have dinner with you, I usually treat you.
At least when you go shopping at the convenience store, you pay for it!

228
00:16:03,990 --> 00:16:05,960
Thats not what you did at first.

229
00:16:06,160 --> 00:16:07,830
That was the first time you and I met.

230
00:16:07,830 --> 00:16:12,870
At that point, you had never treated me to anything.
In fact, I treated you first.

231
00:16:14,540 --> 00:16:20,510
You'll have more memories of Downtown Matsumoto
from now oooooon...

232
00:16:24,510 --> 00:16:28,920
That's only the first time!
Do you know how many times I have treated you since then?

233
00:16:28,920 --> 00:16:34,460
Indeed you usually treat me.
At that point, you had never treated me to anything.

234
00:16:35,290 --> 00:16:37,060
You should at least say thank you to me.

235
00:16:38,330 --> 00:16:41,260
I'm going to have to take you to court for something else if you keep talking like that.

236
00:16:41,600 --> 00:16:44,000
I didn't do anything wrong.

237
00:16:44,430 --> 00:16:46,400
All you do is engage in foursomes.

238
00:16:48,140 --> 00:16:50,270
Thank you, witness.

239
00:16:50,540 --> 00:16:51,740
You do that?

240
00:16:55,680 --> 00:16:57,710
Unlike you, I have a household!!

241
00:16:57,710 --> 00:16:58,680
I have a household!!!!

242
00:16:59,250 --> 00:17:02,580
If everyone knew I was having a foursome, my wife wouldn't be able to walk out the door!

243
00:17:08,720 --> 00:17:12,290
- Rock-Paper-Scissors in a Gastropub Case -

244
00:17:14,060 --> 00:17:20,330
This was when Matsumoto, Imada and Yamashita went to a gastropub.

245
00:17:21,300 --> 00:17:23,540
Imada, you have been active lately.

246
00:17:23,970 --> 00:17:25,870
It's okay.

247
00:17:26,440 --> 00:17:27,540
How about you, Yamashita?

248
00:17:27,540 --> 00:17:29,180
I'm not good at all.

249
00:17:29,180 --> 00:17:31,710
You have to be better.

250
00:17:33,010 --> 00:17:38,550
The three  were having a great time, and when the meal was over, it was time to pay the bill.

251
00:17:39,250 --> 00:17:42,420
Let's have a game of rock-paper-scissors to see who pays.

252
00:17:42,420 --> 00:17:44,930
Oh, sure, that's fine.

253
00:17:45,160 --> 00:17:51,170
But it is obvious that Yamashita earns less than the other two.

254
00:17:52,470 --> 00:17:54,300
Give me a handicap.

255
00:17:54,670 --> 00:17:59,410
I win if I win one game.
Imada-san wins if you win two games.
Matsumoto-san wins if you win three games.

256
00:17:59,410 --> 00:18:00,770
How about this?

257
00:18:01,140 --> 00:18:02,310
Then...

258
00:18:03,740 --> 00:18:09,050
Why should I give you a handicap?
I'd rather have the handicap, asshole!

259
00:18:09,750 --> 00:18:15,690
Matsumoto, who earns hundreds of times more than Yamashita, did not accept his offer.

260
00:18:15,890 --> 00:18:19,360
And they ended up playing one round of rock-paper-scissors.

261
00:18:20,230 --> 00:18:23,930
It's a big game!
Here we go!

262
00:18:24,870 --> 00:18:27,630
Rock-paper-scissors!

263
00:18:28,670 --> 00:18:30,340
Oh, no!!

264
00:18:30,340 --> 00:18:33,270
Hell yeahhhh!!
I won!!

265
00:18:33,910 --> 00:18:38,350
In the end, Yamashita, the loser, paid the bill.

266
00:18:38,880 --> 00:18:41,580
I got free food!!

267
00:18:46,320 --> 00:18:48,260
There was another case like this.

268
00:18:48,690 --> 00:18:50,620
Judge, I would like to call a witness.

269
00:18:50,620 --> 00:18:52,790
All right. The witness, please enter the court.

270
00:18:56,200 --> 00:18:59,570
He is Yamashita-kun, who was in VCR.

271
00:19:00,500 --> 00:19:02,940
Please explain....hey, are you all right?

272
00:19:02,970 --> 00:19:05,010
Are you okay?

273
00:19:06,370 --> 00:19:11,210
It was fine for me to play rock-paper-scissors.

274
00:19:11,450 --> 00:19:17,350
- Actually, I had played rock-paper-scissors with Yamazaki-san and Miyasako-san before.
- Oh, really?

275
00:19:17,380 --> 00:19:26,030
That time, Yamazaki-san suggested giving me a handicap.
So I enjoyed playing rock-paper-scissors.

276
00:19:26,030 --> 00:19:33,800
This time was a similar case, so I said to him, "Please give me a handicap."

277
00:19:34,070 --> 00:19:39,240
But he said, "Why should I give you a handicap? i'd rather have the handicap."
Why does he need a handicap?

278
00:19:39,370 --> 00:19:40,770
Yeah, why does he need a handicap?

279
00:19:40,810 --> 00:19:43,910
- For what it's worth, I'm the one who needs the handicap.
- That's right.

280
00:19:44,310 --> 00:19:45,250
First of all,

281
00:19:46,910 --> 00:19:48,080
You're nervous.

282
00:19:51,020 --> 00:19:52,050
Calm down!

283
00:19:55,690 --> 00:19:56,260
It doesn't matter.

284
00:19:56,260 --> 00:19:58,690
I don't want to talk to a nervous comedian.

285
00:20:00,130 --> 00:20:01,530
Hang on!

286
00:20:01,660 --> 00:20:03,060
i'm gonna go crazy too!

287
00:20:03,060 --> 00:20:04,930
I'm not nervous!
What are you talking about!?

288
00:20:04,930 --> 00:20:06,970
He says he's not nervous, so it's okay.

289
00:20:08,240 --> 00:20:10,300
I adore Matsumoto-san.

290
00:20:10,640 --> 00:20:15,010
I want to see him looking cool.
But the other day I saw him being uncool.

291
00:20:15,440 --> 00:20:18,950
Lately he has been drinking a lot with SMAP's Nakai-san.

292
00:20:19,210 --> 00:20:23,350
And Nakai-san always treats Matsumoto-san.

293
00:20:24,820 --> 00:20:26,390
That is not good!

294
00:20:26,690 --> 00:20:28,060
This is hard for me!

295
00:20:28,560 --> 00:20:29,960
That is not good!

296
00:20:30,190 --> 00:20:35,030
-That is not good!!
- As Matsumoto san's junior, it's fine for me to say thank you to Matsumoto-san.

297
00:20:35,430 --> 00:20:37,700
But for me to say thank you to Nakai-san is complicated.

298
00:20:37,700 --> 00:20:41,030
If it were me, it would be fine, but I don't want to see Imada-san, who is older than him, saying thank you to Nakai-san either.

299
00:20:41,340 --> 00:20:43,170
Don't let them do that!

300
00:20:43,640 --> 00:20:47,210
- What the hell, asshole!
- Matsumoto should not let them do that! I know how you feel!

301
00:20:47,610 --> 00:20:49,740
Defendant, what do you think about this?

302
00:20:49,940 --> 00:20:55,120
This is not a personal exchange.

303
00:20:55,680 --> 00:21:00,190
This is not "Hitoshi Matsumoto and Masahiro Nakai."

304
00:21:00,590 --> 00:21:03,460
This is "Yoshimoto Kogyo and Johnny's."

305
00:21:05,290 --> 00:21:07,690
Do you know which office is making more money right now!?

306
00:21:07,890 --> 00:21:10,900
No, no, no, Nakai has nothing to do with it.

307
00:21:11,030 --> 00:21:14,370
Yes, he does!  This is an exchange of offices!

308
00:21:14,530 --> 00:21:17,200
No, it's not.
You are older than Nakai!

309
00:21:17,300 --> 00:21:19,910
Their new song "Lion Heart" sold like hotcakes.

310
00:21:22,110 --> 00:21:25,050
But they don't get much money.

311
00:21:25,180 --> 00:21:27,710
That doesn't matter to me.

312
00:21:27,950 --> 00:21:29,720
Anyway!!

313
00:21:29,720 --> 00:21:32,150
What the hell are you!!?

314
00:21:32,150 --> 00:21:33,520
I'm just telling the truth.

315
00:21:33,520 --> 00:21:34,290
Go home.

316
00:21:34,290 --> 00:21:36,090
I was there when it happened.

317
00:21:36,560 --> 00:21:37,420
He always does, right?

318
00:21:37,420 --> 00:21:42,730
First, Nakai-kun said, "I invited you today, so I'll pay."

319
00:21:43,400 --> 00:21:47,400
Then Matsumoto-san once said no, "No, I'll pay."

320
00:21:47,700 --> 00:21:50,240
Then we thought the conversation would go:

321
00:21:50,240 --> 00:21:53,970
"I'll pay,"
"No, I'll pay,"
"No, let me pay,"
"No, no , no, let me pay."

322
00:21:53,970 --> 00:21:56,240
But he immediately said, "Oh, really? Thanks."

323
00:21:58,410 --> 00:22:00,250
His will is really weak.

324
00:22:01,520 --> 00:22:05,750
Are you idiots!?
What do you think you're doing!?

325
00:22:05,750 --> 00:22:07,950
Why didn't you pay?

326
00:22:07,950 --> 00:22:09,120
I paid, asshole!!

327
00:22:10,960 --> 00:22:11,990
You didn't pay!!

328
00:22:11,990 --> 00:22:13,030
I paid!

329
00:22:13,030 --> 00:22:14,060
You didn't pay!

330
00:22:14,930 --> 00:22:16,030
I paid for everything!!

331
00:22:16,030 --> 00:22:17,130
You didn't pay!

332
00:22:18,600 --> 00:22:19,600
Go for it!

333
00:22:19,930 --> 00:22:20,870
What the hell!!

334
00:22:20,870 --> 00:22:22,900
You didn't pay AT ALL!!!

335
00:22:25,840 --> 00:22:27,010
Please pay up!!

336
00:22:27,010 --> 00:22:33,580
I paid for everything you didn't know.
I paid after that.

337
00:22:33,710 --> 00:22:38,690
I always keep your wallet and pay on your behalf.

338
00:22:39,050 --> 00:22:40,590
So I know if you are paying or not at that time.

339
00:22:40,590 --> 00:22:41,920
I see, you are paying instead of Matsumoto.

340
00:22:41,920 --> 00:22:45,130
And I always see Nakai-san paying!!

341
00:22:45,130 --> 00:22:48,200
No, it's not!
It's because he invited me!!

342
00:22:48,700 --> 00:22:51,060
No, you didn't pay when you invited him either.

343
00:22:52,900 --> 00:22:54,900
It doesn't matter if I didn't pay.

344
00:22:59,770 --> 00:23:02,180
Fuck you all!!

345
00:23:05,180 --> 00:23:06,280
You're a bunch of pussies!

346
00:23:07,480 --> 00:23:08,580
Low-brow comedians!!

347
00:23:10,120 --> 00:23:11,180
That's absurd.

348
00:23:11,180 --> 00:23:14,050
You, you, you, and you are all low-brow comedians!
Fuck you all!!

349
00:23:14,150 --> 00:23:15,990
But Yamashita, just go home.

350
00:23:15,990 --> 00:23:17,190
I don't like that!!

351
00:23:17,720 --> 00:23:19,030
Let me be one of them!!

352
00:23:20,730 --> 00:23:24,230
Unbelievable testimonies are revealed one after another!!

353
00:23:26,230 --> 00:23:30,800
Is Matsumoto really a stingy bastard!?

354
00:23:32,540 --> 00:23:42,550
The second part will be aired next week!!

355
00:23:46,490 --> 00:23:49,360
Finally, Matsumoto will be sentenced!!
