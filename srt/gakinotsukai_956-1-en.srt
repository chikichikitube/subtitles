And we have special guests!

5
00:00:26,490 --> 00:00:28,500
Downtown!

6
00:00:36,600 --> 00:00:37,770
Hi.

7
00:00:38,840 --> 00:00:43,310
This time you guys are special guests.

8
00:00:43,310 --> 00:00:45,610
- All I have to do is answer the quiz, right?
- Yes.

9
00:00:46,050 --> 00:00:47,110
Please take a look here.

10
00:00:47,110 --> 00:00:51,890
On the back of the numbers in this panel, there are quizzes about each duo.

11
00:00:52,750 --> 00:00:56,960
The higher the point, the more difficult the quiz.

12
00:00:57,520 --> 00:01:00,890
- If I win, will you give me something?
- Of course!

13
00:01:00,990 --> 00:01:03,430
We have prepared that.

14
00:01:03,500 --> 00:01:09,040
We will present a Hawaii trip to the winning duo!

15
00:01:11,700 --> 00:01:14,240
- Are you serious!?
- That's amazing!

16
00:01:15,510 --> 00:01:18,850
You mean the winning duo and us get to go to Hawaii?

17
00:01:18,850 --> 00:01:22,080
Sorry, your explanation wasn't clear.

18
00:01:22,250 --> 00:01:25,220
If Downtown wins, you guys can go to Hawaii.

19
00:01:26,190 --> 00:01:29,620
- So if Cocorico wins, we can't go?
- Of course.

20
00:01:30,490 --> 00:01:33,730
This is the prize.
Good luck everyone!

21
00:01:34,330 --> 00:01:38,900
- However, you cannot answer questions about yourselves.
- Well, that's obvious!

22
00:01:40,270 --> 00:01:41,030
Is there something wrong?

23
00:01:41,030 --> 00:01:41,970
Nothing.

24
00:01:43,100 --> 00:01:45,940
- However, you cannot answer questions about yourselves.
- That's obvious!

25
00:01:46,340 --> 00:01:49,310
It's natural that you know the question.

26
00:01:49,840 --> 00:02:00,450
[subbed by RAIDEN1017]

27
00:02:00,920 --> 00:02:06,430
There is an answer button in front of each duo.

28
00:02:07,990 --> 00:02:10,200
The correct and incorrect answer buttons are for you guys to press.

29
00:02:10,260 --> 00:02:12,230
If it's correct, press the correct answer button.

30
00:02:12,230 --> 00:02:14,370
- We can just press this when it's about us, right?
- Yes.

31
00:02:14,970 --> 00:02:18,040
So, Downtown, pick a question.

32
00:02:18,040 --> 00:02:19,740
- Are we first?
- Yes!

33
00:02:19,740 --> 00:02:21,810
- Which one do you wanna go with?
- I'm good with either one.

34
00:02:21,840 --> 00:02:24,610
Then, Cocorico's 10.

35
00:02:26,010 --> 00:02:30,320
Q. What was the name of the duo when Cocorico debuted?

36
00:02:30,320 --> 00:02:31,890
Well, do you know the answer?

37
00:02:31,890 --> 00:02:34,450
Of course I know that.

38
00:02:34,450 --> 00:02:35,990
Downtown!

39
00:02:35,990 --> 00:02:38,120
Cocorico Bombers, right?

40
00:02:41,730 --> 00:02:43,260
Excellent!

41
00:02:43,260 --> 00:02:44,960
You're quite knowledgeable.

42
00:02:45,470 --> 00:02:47,000
Next is Cocorico.

43
00:02:47,000 --> 00:02:48,270
And how many points do we get?

44
00:02:48,270 --> 00:02:49,840
It was 10 points.

45
00:02:50,240 --> 00:02:51,500
It was a question of 10.

46
00:02:51,870 --> 00:02:54,040
Is the number on there the point?

47
00:02:54,040 --> 00:02:56,510
- Yes, it was Cocorico's 10.
- Is that what it means?

48
00:02:56,510 --> 00:02:59,010
So, because we chose 10, we get a 10 points?

49
00:02:59,180 --> 00:03:00,880
You should have said that first.

50
00:03:01,050 --> 00:03:02,620
The rules are a bit unclear.

51
00:03:02,850 --> 00:03:07,450
I said that first. This is the points you get for each correct answer, with different points depending on the difficulty level.

52
00:03:07,650 --> 00:03:09,790
So, do we get to go to Hawaii?

53
00:03:10,090 --> 00:03:11,590
Only if you guys win.

54
00:03:11,590 --> 00:03:13,030
If only you had won at the end.

55
00:03:14,830 --> 00:03:17,130
You can't go to Hawaii every time you answer correctly.

56
00:03:18,100 --> 00:03:18,600
Huh?

57
00:03:19,800 --> 00:03:20,370
What?

58
00:03:21,330 --> 00:03:24,670
You can't go to Hawaii every time you answer correctly.

59
00:03:25,470 --> 00:03:27,710
I thought I could go to Hawaii every time I answered correctly.

60
00:03:27,710 --> 00:03:31,510
That's not doable.

61
00:03:32,650 --> 00:03:35,280
Isn't that number the number of times you can go to Hawaii?

62
00:03:36,020 --> 00:03:37,120
All right, that's enough.

63
00:03:37,120 --> 00:03:41,190
Sorry, anyway, Downtown gets 10 points!

64
00:03:42,590 --> 00:03:45,230
Now, Cocorico, please pick a panel.

65
00:03:45,460 --> 00:03:47,730
Downtown's 10!

66
00:03:49,330 --> 00:03:58,540
Q. What was the most popular show in Osaka that began broadcasting in 1987 and was hosted by Downtown?

67
00:03:58,540 --> 00:03:59,770
I know this!!

68
00:04:01,070 --> 00:04:01,810
I know this!

69
00:04:02,380 --> 00:04:03,510
This is too easy a question!

70
00:04:03,510 --> 00:04:04,880
Jikacho!

71
00:04:04,880 --> 00:04:06,650
"It's 4 o'clock"!

72
00:04:09,280 --> 00:04:10,450
That's wrong?

73
00:04:11,780 --> 00:04:14,490
Isn't "It's 4 o'clock"?

74
00:04:15,420 --> 00:04:16,490
Is this wrong?

75
00:04:16,590 --> 00:04:18,220
Not "It's 4 o'clock"?

76
00:04:18,220 --> 00:04:19,530
It's not.

77
00:04:20,230 --> 00:04:24,000
No, it's actually "Rush! It's 4 o'clock".

78
00:04:25,630 --> 00:04:28,130
Huh, why did you already give the answer?

79
00:04:30,340 --> 00:04:33,440
- There are duos who haven't answered yet.
- Please wait until you get the correct answer.

80
00:04:33,440 --> 00:04:35,980
- You should have said that first!
- It's hard to understand!

81
00:04:36,380 --> 00:04:40,850
Did it have the word "Rush" in its name?

82
00:04:40,850 --> 00:04:44,080
I watched the show every day, but ...

83
00:04:44,080 --> 00:04:48,860
We left that out from the first show because it was too complicated for the broadcast.

84
00:04:48,860 --> 00:04:52,260
Then, the answer is "it's 4 o'clock".

85
00:04:52,590 --> 00:04:55,330
It might have been "it's 4 o'clock Rush!".

86
00:04:55,330 --> 00:04:57,900
In any case, " Rush" is in the title.

87
00:04:57,900 --> 00:05:01,300
- But there was no "Rush" from the first episode, was there?
- Yeah.

88
00:05:01,300 --> 00:05:04,740
But at the meeting stage, it was "It's 4 o'clock Rush！".

89
00:05:05,640 --> 00:05:08,110
Then we don't know.

90
00:05:08,110 --> 00:05:12,210
But the producer told me to do it with that in mind.

91
00:05:12,480 --> 00:05:14,250
But we were watching the broadcast from the very first episode, so...

92
00:05:14,250 --> 00:05:16,420
Cut it out with the endless gripes!

93
00:05:17,280 --> 00:05:18,750
This is incorrect!

94
00:05:19,190 --> 00:05:22,660
So we get 10 points?

95
00:05:23,090 --> 00:05:25,690
No, Jicho-Kacho just doesn't get the points.

96
00:05:25,690 --> 00:05:26,460
That is nonsense.

97
00:05:26,460 --> 00:05:28,830
We should get 10 tons.

98
00:05:28,830 --> 00:05:30,100
10 tons!?

99
00:05:30,100 --> 00:05:32,230
That's not possible. The units are different.

100
00:05:32,800 --> 00:05:36,170
Because no one could answer.

101
00:05:36,400 --> 00:05:37,940
Hey, nobody's laughing.

102
00:05:38,670 --> 00:05:41,510
Let's do it properly.
Nobody's laughing.

103
00:05:42,580 --> 00:05:44,880
But this is just a quiz.

104
00:05:47,410 --> 00:05:50,420
So which one shall we try next?

105
00:05:50,880 --> 00:05:55,390
I would like to challenge the high scoring question.
Downtown's 20!

106
00:05:57,190 --> 00:06:02,300
Q. What is Hamada's favorite animal with a long nose?

107
00:06:04,230 --> 00:06:05,160
Football Hour.

108
00:06:05,930 --> 00:06:07,200
Elephant!

109
00:06:09,300 --> 00:06:13,140
- No?
- There are many other things besides elephants.

110
00:06:13,410 --> 00:06:13,970
Cocorico!

111
00:06:14,210 --> 00:06:15,380
Anteater!

112
00:06:18,110 --> 00:06:18,810
Jicho-Kacho!

113
00:06:18,810 --> 00:06:19,650
Tapir.

114
00:06:20,550 --> 00:06:21,310
Got it!

115
00:06:21,880 --> 00:06:23,380
The animal with the long nose is...

116
00:06:24,150 --> 00:06:25,720
I haven't answered yet.

117
00:06:26,850 --> 00:06:28,250
I haven't answered yet.

118
00:06:28,820 --> 00:06:29,560
Dog.

119
00:06:33,960 --> 00:06:36,360
Time is up.

120
00:06:36,530 --> 00:06:38,560
I got various answers, but...

121
00:06:38,560 --> 00:06:40,770
This one was a little difficult.

122
00:06:40,770 --> 00:06:43,300
It was a difficult for 20 points.

123
00:06:43,300 --> 00:06:45,270
Now tell us the correct answer.

124
00:06:45,270 --> 00:06:47,970
Shall I give the answer?

125
00:06:47,970 --> 00:06:50,980
Yeah....yeah....okay.

126
00:06:50,980 --> 00:06:55,820
Hamada said that an animal with a long nose is an elephant.

127
00:06:57,280 --> 00:06:59,650
I answered that!

128
00:06:59,650 --> 00:07:04,090
But Hamada doesn't like elephants.

129
00:07:05,020 --> 00:07:08,760
- So...
- But the question says "his favorite animal".

130
00:07:09,300 --> 00:07:11,400
Yeah, so...

131
00:07:12,430 --> 00:07:16,770
The animal with the long nose is definitely an elephant.

132
00:07:17,470 --> 00:07:18,500
Do you like that?

133
00:07:18,500 --> 00:07:19,440
No...

134
00:07:19,440 --> 00:07:20,970
Oh, it can't be helped.

135
00:07:22,310 --> 00:07:23,780
It says so in the question.

136
00:07:24,680 --> 00:07:27,350
This is a quiz made by Downtown.

137
00:07:28,380 --> 00:07:30,620
It's not a quiz made by the staff.

138
00:07:30,780 --> 00:07:34,150
This is a quiz made by you guys.

139
00:07:34,150 --> 00:07:39,030
I think this must be a question made with reference to Hamada's much older profile, surely?

140
00:07:39,030 --> 00:07:43,430
Now Hamada says he doesn't like elephants.
You have to understand that.

141
00:07:43,430 --> 00:07:46,300
Did Hamada-san write in his old profile that his favorite animal was an elephant?

142
00:07:46,300 --> 00:07:48,500
- I don't know about that either.
- It's a cute profile.

143
00:07:49,770 --> 00:07:53,670
You can decide what to do.
I don't like that, though.

144
00:07:54,170 --> 00:07:58,140
See, Hamada is getting like this!

145
00:08:06,120 --> 00:08:07,690
That's enough!

146
00:08:07,690 --> 00:08:11,390
See, Hamada is getting like this!

147
00:08:13,160 --> 00:08:16,030
Okay, let's start over and raise the energy!

148
00:08:16,200 --> 00:08:18,900
Downtown, please pick a panel!

149
00:08:18,900 --> 00:08:20,270
You can pick.

150
00:08:20,270 --> 00:08:22,770
I don't want to do it anymore.

151
00:08:22,970 --> 00:08:24,340
Let's do it together.

152
00:08:27,440 --> 00:08:31,810
The game is just beginning.
Downtown, please pick any one you like.

153
00:08:32,140 --> 00:08:34,050
Everyone has made their questions.

154
00:08:34,810 --> 00:08:36,650
Jicho-Kacho's 20.

155
00:08:38,080 --> 00:08:50,260
Q. JIcho-Kacho used to be a trio called Jicho-Kacho-Shacho.
So, what is the occupation that the former member is currently doing in Shinjuku?

156
00:08:51,860 --> 00:08:52,900
Male host.

157
00:08:55,740 --> 00:08:57,140
Okonomiyaki restaurant.

158
00:08:59,310 --> 00:09:01,140
Bar?

159
00:09:02,980 --> 00:09:04,510
Udon restaurant?

160
00:09:12,750 --> 00:09:14,890
Time is up!

161
00:09:14,890 --> 00:09:16,020
Hey, this is up!

162
00:09:16,020 --> 00:09:18,960
This was UP-P before the time's up sounded.

163
00:09:21,260 --> 00:09:22,700
What's wrong today?

164
00:09:22,900 --> 00:09:27,030
What the hell.
This was up before the time's up sounded.

165
00:09:27,030 --> 00:09:30,000
- And it's a disgusting atmosphere.
- "Up-p"?

166
00:09:30,500 --> 00:09:33,070
He's been stuttering a lot today.

167
00:09:33,740 --> 00:09:35,240
So what is the correct answer?

168
00:09:35,240 --> 00:09:37,340
The correct answer is a hairdresser.

169
00:09:39,810 --> 00:09:42,320
By the way, what were you going to answer?

170
00:09:42,320 --> 00:09:43,550
Hairdresser.

171
00:09:45,220 --> 00:09:47,420
- But...
- His answer was correct.

172
00:09:47,650 --> 00:09:49,990
But the time was up.

173
00:09:50,320 --> 00:09:52,990
-I was correct.
- But it can't be helped.

174
00:09:53,730 --> 00:09:56,730
- What was Hamada's answer?
- Bar.

175
00:09:56,730 --> 00:09:59,870
I think the bar is close to the answer too.

176
00:10:00,170 --> 00:10:02,070
In terms of approximate values, yes.

177
00:10:02,200 --> 00:10:03,800
Approximate values?

178
00:10:05,240 --> 00:10:10,610
Jicho-Kacho won the game match and became the top.

179
00:10:11,280 --> 00:10:13,180
This is rigged!

180
00:10:13,610 --> 00:10:17,350
- This is ridiculous!
- It can't be because there are so many holes.

181
00:10:17,580 --> 00:10:21,450
- But if we were the first, we would have put it in this hole.
- Yeah, I said so.

182
00:10:21,850 --> 00:10:23,920
- I said, "This one, I guess".
- "This one"?

183
00:10:24,420 --> 00:10:26,190
- I said so.
- He said he would put it in this hole.

184
00:10:26,190 --> 00:10:27,860
But Inoue was first in the order.

185
00:10:27,860 --> 00:10:30,360
Earlier, when he had the sword, he said, "This one".

186
00:10:30,960 --> 00:10:32,930
But you guys were not first.

187
00:10:33,630 --> 00:10:35,170
Is this not good?

188
00:10:35,400 --> 00:10:38,640
But the turn was theirs first, you guys were close.

189
00:10:38,640 --> 00:10:40,670
Whatever!!

190
00:10:43,780 --> 00:10:44,940
Whatever!!

191
00:10:46,210 --> 00:10:53,790
Q. Hamada invited Matsumoto to join Yoshimoto and he was quite torn. But...?

192
00:10:56,060 --> 00:10:59,060
The 40 points question is quite difficult.

193
00:10:59,060 --> 00:11:01,290
"But..."?

194
00:11:01,290 --> 00:11:03,000
Is this a valid question?

195
00:11:05,100 --> 00:11:07,000
Time is up.

196
00:11:07,100 --> 00:11:09,300
Is this a valid question?

197
00:11:09,540 --> 00:11:10,770
Please tell us the correct answer.

198
00:11:11,400 --> 00:11:15,680
After all, no one could answer and I don't have to tell you that, do I?

199
00:11:15,910 --> 00:11:19,480
We want to know the correct answer.

200
00:11:19,480 --> 00:11:20,950
There is no answer to this question.

201
00:11:22,050 --> 00:11:23,580
What does that mean?

202
00:11:24,520 --> 00:11:27,420
There is no answer.

203
00:11:28,020 --> 00:11:29,560
Then it's not a question.

204
00:11:29,720 --> 00:11:31,790
Huh, why are you looking surprised?

205
00:11:32,690 --> 00:11:34,930
That's actually the expression we make.

206
00:11:35,860 --> 00:11:37,430
Why are you looking so surprised?

207
00:11:39,630 --> 00:11:40,670
"There is no answer"?

208
00:11:40,670 --> 00:11:46,770
If the answer is your private information and you can't answer, is there even the right one?

209
00:11:46,770 --> 00:11:48,870
Of course there is.
There is that.

210
00:11:52,240 --> 00:11:53,510
I wouldn't be saying this if that wasn't there.

211
00:11:53,550 --> 00:11:54,980
Would you tell us that?

212
00:11:55,410 --> 00:11:56,650
There is that.

213
00:11:57,080 --> 00:12:00,990
I don't like today's Endo.

214
00:12:03,760 --> 00:12:06,390
He is very quarrelsome.

215
00:12:07,730 --> 00:12:10,200
I'm not like that.

216
00:12:10,530 --> 00:12:13,330
I really want to compete with people from my own generation after all.

217
00:12:16,970 --> 00:12:22,680
But when Tommies hears that, he's going to say, "What do you mean?"

218
00:12:22,840 --> 00:12:24,640
High-heels would say the same thing.

219
00:12:24,640 --> 00:12:27,880
No, Ken-chan(Tommies) will answer in a better way.

220
00:12:31,880 --> 00:12:35,890
Then, Downtown, please choose the next panel.

221
00:12:36,060 --> 00:12:37,190
Okay, Endo's.

222
00:12:37,190 --> 00:12:40,630
My dislike of Cocorico Endo's 40.

223
00:12:42,130 --> 00:12:49,970
Q. What was the first legend they achieved when Cocorico Golden Legend was still airing late at night?

224
00:12:52,710 --> 00:12:56,610
- Downtown.
- Ate all the conveyor belt sushi?

225
00:13:00,050 --> 00:13:01,480
Eating eel pie for 7 days.

226
00:13:04,480 --> 00:13:07,150
Climbing the chimney of a public bathhouse.

227
00:13:07,350 --> 00:13:09,490
We did that too, but different.

228
00:13:12,290 --> 00:13:15,160
- This is difficult.
- Time is up.

229
00:13:16,460 --> 00:13:19,300
Hey, is this the button that makes the time is up sound?

230
00:13:19,730 --> 00:13:24,670
- No, this is the button to up this.
- Are you sure about that?

231
00:13:24,800 --> 00:13:28,970
- This is like the time is up button.
- The timing of the sound of Time is up was the same.

232
00:13:28,970 --> 00:13:31,380
Oh, this is up again.

233
00:13:31,640 --> 00:13:33,810
Then please answer.

234
00:13:33,950 --> 00:13:35,250
What's the answer?

235
00:13:35,250 --> 00:13:37,250
Guys, can I give him the right to answer?

236
00:13:37,680 --> 00:13:40,990
I won't listen, so go ahead and give the answer!

237
00:13:41,550 --> 00:13:43,220
This has already timed out, hasn't it?

238
00:13:43,390 --> 00:13:46,090
But I gave him one chance to answer.

239
00:13:46,090 --> 00:13:49,090
He's covering his ears now, so just tell me the answer.

240
00:13:49,090 --> 00:13:51,130
He's covering his ears.

241
00:13:51,130 --> 00:13:55,470
Matsumoto-san, what are you doing?
Matsumoto-san?

242
00:13:56,300 --> 00:13:57,570
Matsumoto-san.

243
00:13:58,240 --> 00:14:00,070
Please go ahead and answer.

244
00:14:00,070 --> 00:14:03,310
- I won't listen, so go ahead and give the answer.
- Yeah, don't worry.

245
00:14:05,240 --> 00:14:07,280
Why don't you tell me the answer?

246
00:14:07,280 --> 00:14:08,850
It doesn't make sense to me.

247
00:14:09,550 --> 00:14:10,950
I really don't make any sense.

248
00:14:11,120 --> 00:14:14,790
I told him I would give him the right to answer.

249
00:14:16,420 --> 00:14:21,390
- So I don't make any sense at all why he is covering his own ears.
- You must never say the answer.

250
00:14:21,390 --> 00:14:23,600
If he really can't hear, should I go ahead and give the answer?

251
00:14:23,600 --> 00:14:26,400
It's better to speak in a low voice.

252
00:14:26,570 --> 00:14:33,410
We made a leaf rake using real bear paws.

253
00:14:33,410 --> 00:14:35,470
Wow, you were doing that!

254
00:14:38,910 --> 00:14:42,450
Well, Matsumoto-san, please answer.

255
00:14:43,150 --> 00:14:44,250
Matsumoto-san.

256
00:14:45,950 --> 00:14:47,050
Matsumoto-san.

257
00:14:49,150 --> 00:14:52,120
Ummm, could it be that one?

258
00:14:52,420 --> 00:14:55,390
Maybe it's the one about the bear?

259
00:14:57,860 --> 00:14:59,030
Did you hear the answer I said?

260
00:14:59,030 --> 00:15:00,400
"The one about bear"?

261
00:15:00,400 --> 00:15:02,800
Maybe it's the one about bear?

262
00:15:03,500 --> 00:15:04,800
Close! Close! Close! Close! Close!

263
00:15:04,800 --> 00:15:09,640
Making a leaf rake using real bear paws?

264
00:15:12,140 --> 00:15:13,250
Yeah!

265
00:15:15,080 --> 00:15:16,580
Excellent.

266
00:15:19,590 --> 00:15:21,890
It's weird to answer, "The one about bears".

267
00:15:22,420 --> 00:15:24,320
This is quite a difficult question to answer.

268
00:15:24,320 --> 00:15:27,990
So, Downtown gets 40 points.

269
00:15:32,600 --> 00:15:35,530
We have no choice but to play a big game.

270
00:15:36,100 --> 00:15:39,000
Downtown's 50.

271
00:15:40,470 --> 00:15:44,080
Serious match!
Washtub Stopper Challenge!

272
00:15:48,880 --> 00:15:50,580
Please come forward.

273
00:15:50,580 --> 00:16:01,930
This is a game where your guts count.
Whoever blindfolds themselves and stops the falling washtub closest to their head wins.

274
00:16:01,930 --> 00:16:04,360
- Wow, that's scary.
- Who wants to be the first to do this?

275
00:16:04,360 --> 00:16:05,360
Iwao, you do it.

276
00:16:05,360 --> 00:16:07,530
Okay, I'll do it.

277
00:16:07,530 --> 00:16:08,770
It's a big washtub.

278
00:16:10,140 --> 00:16:12,670
It's disadvantageous to be the first to do this.

279
00:16:13,740 --> 00:16:16,080
That might be true.

280
00:16:16,080 --> 00:16:17,680
Wouldn't it have been better if you had seen someone else do it first before you did it?

281
00:16:17,680 --> 00:16:19,580
He suddenly said, "I'll do it."

282
00:16:23,320 --> 00:16:26,050
- Please start at your timing.
- Okay.

283
00:16:26,450 --> 00:16:27,850
Here I go.

284
00:16:31,690 --> 00:16:34,160
Don't let go of the rope.

285
00:16:35,660 --> 00:16:37,200
Do you understand how to do this?

286
00:16:37,360 --> 00:16:39,230
If you let go of the rope, it's absolutely impossible

287
00:16:39,300 --> 00:16:40,770
Why did you do this in the first?

288
00:16:40,770 --> 00:16:42,940
You should have points deducted.

289
00:16:42,940 --> 00:16:43,840
Why did you let go of the rope?

290
00:16:43,840 --> 00:16:45,800
I was going to let go of the rope and then grab it.

291
00:16:45,800 --> 00:16:47,870
That's impossible because you're blindfolded.

292
00:16:48,740 --> 00:16:50,010
Get a hold of yourself!

293
00:16:52,480 --> 00:16:54,950
- Now it's Jicho-Kacho's turn, which one of you will do this?
- I will do it.

294
00:16:54,950 --> 00:16:59,850
- If you've done this before, you're good at it.
- Koumoto-san seems to be good at this kind of thing.

295
00:17:08,660 --> 00:17:10,600
Shouldn't he be out?

296
00:17:10,600 --> 00:17:13,100
Isn't this a game where you shouldn't let the washtub hit your head?

297
00:17:13,100 --> 00:17:14,570
Alright, you may begin!

298
00:17:14,570 --> 00:17:16,000
I'm counting on you!

299
00:17:16,000 --> 00:17:17,240
Here I go!

300
00:17:20,870 --> 00:17:23,080
Stop! I'll measure!

301
00:17:23,080 --> 00:17:24,110
You were too scared.

302
00:17:24,510 --> 00:17:25,510
That's pretty high.

303
00:17:26,510 --> 00:17:28,250
70 cm!

304
00:17:29,080 --> 00:17:31,180
I thought I could get it under 50 cm.

305
00:17:31,580 --> 00:17:33,220
Your record is 70 cm.

306
00:17:33,220 --> 00:17:34,790
Next please.

307
00:17:34,790 --> 00:17:35,950
Those with a higher sitting height may have an advantage.

308
00:17:35,950 --> 00:17:36,820
- Are you alright?
- I'm okay.

309
00:17:36,820 --> 00:17:38,420
You have to grab the red tape.

310
00:17:39,020 --> 00:17:40,890
- You were grabbing the red tape, weren't you?
- Yes.

311
00:17:40,890 --> 00:17:41,760
He didn't.

312
00:17:46,470 --> 00:17:47,330
Are you okay?

313
00:17:47,730 --> 00:17:48,700
Are you okay?

314
00:17:49,470 --> 00:17:50,370
Are you okay?

315
00:17:52,270 --> 00:17:53,370
He's out, isn't he?

316
00:17:53,610 --> 00:17:55,070
He hasn't tried yet.

317
00:17:55,340 --> 00:17:57,940
- That sounded terrible.
- It hurt like hell.

318
00:17:59,480 --> 00:18:01,310
The corner of the washtub hit him in the head.

319
00:18:03,220 --> 00:18:04,280
Are you okay?

320
00:18:04,380 --> 00:18:05,980
It's pretty dented.

321
00:18:07,390 --> 00:18:09,390
That must have hurt him a lot.

322
00:18:09,860 --> 00:18:11,620
His face is turning red.

323
00:18:14,730 --> 00:18:20,130
Endo challenged in place of the injured Tanaka.
However, he could not match Koumoto's record.

324
00:18:20,830 --> 00:18:23,240
85 cm!

325
00:18:24,000 --> 00:18:26,340
Now, Matsumoto-san will take the next challenge.

326
00:18:26,610 --> 00:18:29,810
Matsumoto-san, you have done something like this several times, haven't you?

327
00:18:30,010 --> 00:18:31,740
Maybe so.

328
00:18:32,080 --> 00:18:34,750
Alright, you may begin!

329
00:18:35,280 --> 00:18:37,820
Alright, you may begin!

330
00:18:38,350 --> 00:18:39,320
Here I go.

331
00:18:46,090 --> 00:18:47,260
Wait a second.

332
00:18:48,660 --> 00:18:50,400
The ruler isn't long enough to measure the length.

333
00:18:50,400 --> 00:18:51,860
- Wait a second.
- What's wrong?

334
00:18:52,160 --> 00:18:54,700
I'm kind of so scared.

335
00:18:56,600 --> 00:18:58,870
This is that kind of game.

336
00:18:59,470 --> 00:19:00,510
This is a game of chicken.

337
00:19:00,510 --> 00:19:01,540
I'm having heart palpitations.

338
00:19:01,740 --> 00:19:02,440
Really?

339
00:19:02,880 --> 00:19:05,010
I have a little heart palpitations.

340
00:19:06,510 --> 00:19:07,110
Are you okay?

341
00:19:07,510 --> 00:19:10,450
However, your record is already out.

342
00:19:12,150 --> 00:19:13,450
It's over 100 cm.

343
00:19:13,590 --> 00:19:16,090
Okay, I'll do it.
I'll do it again.

344
00:19:16,960 --> 00:19:17,820
Let's have him do it again.

345
00:19:17,820 --> 00:19:19,860
But he has already done this.

346
00:19:20,990 --> 00:19:23,460
I cannot end with such a record.

347
00:19:23,460 --> 00:19:25,800
I feel bad for everyone.

348
00:19:26,500 --> 00:19:28,100
No, you don't have to do it anymore.

349
00:19:28,470 --> 00:19:30,540
He feels bad but says he'll do it again.

350
00:19:31,470 --> 00:19:32,770
Please grab the red tape.

351
00:19:33,070 --> 00:19:33,810
Let's go.

352
00:19:34,170 --> 00:19:36,240
Matsumoto-san, you may begin!

353
00:19:38,010 --> 00:19:40,010
This isn't good, I still feel sick.

354
00:19:40,980 --> 00:19:43,420
-  I feel sick.
- Let's measure his record.

355
00:19:43,720 --> 00:19:46,290
No, no, no, he is feeling unwell.

356
00:19:46,290 --> 00:19:48,790
I feel sick. I feel palpitations.

357
00:19:49,050 --> 00:19:51,390
You'll be okay. It's okay.

358
00:19:51,660 --> 00:19:53,190
Let's measure now.

359
00:19:53,190 --> 00:19:54,730
He didn't do this yet.

360
00:19:54,730 --> 00:19:57,730
- I feel like throwing up.
- Hang in there a little longer!

361
00:19:58,260 --> 00:20:01,400
Hang in there! Just a bit more!

362
00:20:01,730 --> 00:20:03,770
- Oh, I feel sick.
- Just a bit more!

363
00:20:04,070 --> 00:20:09,340
- I feel sick. I feel like throwing up.
- Just a bit more! Almost!

364
00:20:09,340 --> 00:20:11,410
Oh, great!
Very nice!

365
00:20:11,410 --> 00:20:12,640
That's great!!

366
00:20:13,110 --> 00:20:13,980
You did it!!

367
00:20:14,780 --> 00:20:16,220
Okay...

368
00:20:16,220 --> 00:20:17,850
Here!!

369
00:20:18,320 --> 00:20:20,290
What the hell are you doing?

370
00:20:22,520 --> 00:20:23,690
You did it!

371
00:20:25,320 --> 00:20:27,130
Measure it quickly, Yama-chan!

372
00:20:32,830 --> 00:20:34,100
8 cm.

373
00:20:35,900 --> 00:20:36,940
You did it well.

374
00:20:38,270 --> 00:20:40,070
You did well even though you weren't feeling well.

375
00:20:41,370 --> 00:20:42,470
It was close.

376
00:20:47,980 --> 00:20:49,350
Look, it's only this much.

377
00:20:49,350 --> 00:20:51,620
It's because you were giving instructions.

378
00:20:51,620 --> 00:20:52,950
I didn't do that.

379
00:20:52,950 --> 00:20:54,250
You did.

380
00:20:54,490 --> 00:20:57,120
I'm kind of sorry.
but...

381
00:20:58,190 --> 00:21:00,030
I see, so my record was 8cm.

382
00:21:00,730 --> 00:21:02,160
It's not your record.

383
00:21:05,200 --> 00:21:07,000
It's not your record.

384
00:21:09,330 --> 00:21:11,370
You didn't stop the falling washtab by yourself.

385
00:21:12,170 --> 00:21:13,510
He did it slowly.

386
00:21:13,510 --> 00:21:16,240
He didn't do it slowly. Can't I see the video recording?

387
00:21:16,440 --> 00:21:17,610
Can we watch the recorded video?

388
00:21:17,810 --> 00:21:19,010
He didn't do it slowly.

389
00:21:19,010 --> 00:21:20,710
Let's watch the video recording.

390
00:21:21,280 --> 00:21:22,850
[VCR Verification]

391
00:21:26,080 --> 00:21:27,920
This is very slow

392
00:21:32,560 --> 00:21:34,490
See, I'm just cheering him on.

393
00:21:37,060 --> 00:21:38,930
He is not wearing an eye mask.

394
00:21:38,930 --> 00:21:40,170
His eye mask is completely off.

395
00:21:40,170 --> 00:21:41,400
Here!!

396
00:21:42,000 --> 00:21:43,400
He said "Here".

397
00:21:44,370 --> 00:21:45,800
He said "Here".

398
00:21:46,610 --> 00:21:50,280
As you can see, Hamada-san was giving instructions.

399
00:21:50,280 --> 00:21:52,180
No, I was just cheering him on!

400
00:21:52,180 --> 00:21:55,880
And Matsumoto-san's eye mask was completely off.

401
00:21:55,880 --> 00:21:58,180
So Koumoto wins!

402
00:22:01,320 --> 00:22:03,460
You guys totaled 70 points.

403
00:22:04,260 --> 00:22:06,590
That was the last game.

404
00:22:07,430 --> 00:22:12,000
So the winner is Jicho-Kacho!

405
00:22:16,740 --> 00:22:22,010
Congratulations!
We are giving away a trip to Hawaii to you guys.

406
00:22:22,010 --> 00:22:23,510
Yeah! Hawaii!

407
00:22:24,010 --> 00:22:25,110
Have fun!

408
00:22:25,410 --> 00:22:27,580
I don't think he can easily accept something like that.

409
00:22:27,580 --> 00:22:29,250
Yeah, I feel sorry for them.

410
00:22:29,250 --> 00:22:32,020
Thay hasn't shown his good side at all

411
00:22:33,120 --> 00:22:36,220
I could see how athletic he is.

412
00:22:38,020 --> 00:22:41,090
That's not good.

413
00:22:41,090 --> 00:22:43,200
Shall we receive it on your behalf?

414
00:22:44,700 --> 00:22:45,500
Why?

415
00:22:46,370 --> 00:22:49,130
Could you lend it to us for a little while?

416
00:22:49,370 --> 00:22:50,900
Do you want to borrow this?

417
00:22:50,900 --> 00:22:54,140
Do you want to borrow this board?

418
00:22:55,970 --> 00:22:57,680
It would be okay to just lend it to them, right?

419
00:22:57,840 --> 00:22:59,110
I can lend you this board.

420
00:22:59,110 --> 00:23:00,910
But, we have the rights to the trip to Hawaii.

421
00:23:02,580 --> 00:23:04,950
Show us on camera.

422
00:23:04,950 --> 00:23:05,980
What are you doing?

423
00:23:05,980 --> 00:23:08,220
Play the sound, hey!

424
00:23:14,490 --> 00:23:16,130
What are you guys doing?

425
00:23:16,900 --> 00:23:18,060
What are they doing?

426
00:23:19,300 --> 00:23:22,330
I don't mind lending it to you guys, but what are you guys doing with it?

427
00:23:22,870 --> 00:23:24,670
The winner is Jicho-Kacho.

428
00:23:25,000 --> 00:23:27,240
You guys wanted to feel like a winner?

429
00:23:27,470 --> 00:23:29,540
I see.

430
00:23:29,880 --> 00:23:32,310
But I don't think the sound will play even if you have this.

431
00:23:32,680 --> 00:23:34,510
It's the same for anyone who has this.

432
00:23:35,550 --> 00:23:36,180
See?

433
00:23:38,020 --> 00:23:39,650
Please don't push the button.

434
00:23:40,220 --> 00:23:41,790
Then lend it to us.

435
00:23:48,860 --> 00:23:50,960
Staff should also not play that.

436
00:23:51,530 --> 00:23:53,400
Why did they play the sound?

437
00:23:53,770 --> 00:23:56,770
- They are not winners.
- That's the staff's fault.

438
00:23:56,770 --> 00:23:57,570
What are they doing?

439
00:23:57,570 --> 00:23:58,740
Let's go then.

440
00:24:00,740 --> 00:24:01,540
See you.

441
00:24:01,740 --> 00:24:03,880
Yama-chan, you should think more about what you're doing.

442
00:24:05,080 --> 00:24:06,910
Because the quiz is all about the content.
