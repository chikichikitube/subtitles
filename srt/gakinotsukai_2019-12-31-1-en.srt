T/N: Japan uses eras based on the emperor's reign. Emperor Akihito abdicated the throne in 2019 for the first time in Japanese history since 1817 to his son, Naruhito. Thus the end of the Heisei era and the beginning of the Reiwa era.

5
00:00:00,520 --> 00:00:04,420
The last night of the first year of the Reiwa era

6
00:00:04,730 --> 00:00:06,930
It was a tough school

7
00:00:07,090 --> 00:00:08,630
This person actually appeared

8
00:00:08,700 --> 00:00:10,330
It's rather different from previous years

9
00:00:10,400 --> 00:00:12,470
It's the one which has surprised me the most so far

10
00:00:12,530 --> 00:00:15,470
Fitting for it being the last

11
00:00:16,200 --> 00:00:20,710
Provoked into the depths of suppressed emotions

12
00:00:20,770 --> 00:00:23,110
You made me wait too long!!

13
00:00:23,110 --> 00:00:28,480

That forbidden routine is finally unsealed

57
00:00:54,420 --> 00:00:57,550
You guys ain't recording right?

58
00:00:57,550 --> 00:00:59,110

I'll take it

70
00:01:18,480 --> 00:01:20,310
Even now during Reiwa era,

00:01:43,060 --> 00:01:45,460
It's possible they didn't film anything

91
00:01:43,800 --> 00:01:45,710
No, it was filmed

92
00:01:45,460 --> 00:01:47,930
We might even have to do a press conference to apologize

93
00:01:47,970 --> 00:01:49,650
Something like "We didn't film anything this year!"

94
00:01:49,800 --> 00:01:51,380
We did do it properly, for now

95
00:01:51,470 --> 00:01:53,270
It's aired for 14 consecutive years

96
00:01:52,420 --> 00:01:56,690

97

00:01:53,730 --> 00:01:55,220
It's amazing

100
00:01:56,690 --> 00:01:59,410
Well then, Matsumoto

101
00:01:57,290 --> 00:01:59,600
Do I have to do it this time as well?

102
00:01:58,720 --> 00:02:00,040
All right!

103
00:02:00,040 --> 00:02:01,400
If you please

104
00:02:01,360 --> 00:02:04,820
VTR... Over there, that camera

105
00:02:01,690 --> 00:02:04,150
All right, I'll start. Then, I suppose it can't he-helped! Where do I look?

106
00:02:05,800 --> 00:02:07,800
VTR...

107
00:02:07,800 --> 00:02:13,090
T/N: This is a reference to a scandal regarding comedians who were suspended by Yoshimoto Kogyo. Yoshimoto CEO Okamoto said this phrase when informing them of their suspension as a joke, but it fell flat as they took it to be him exerting pressure on them.

108
00:02:07,800 --> 00:02:13,090
You guys ain't recording right?!

109
00:02:09,730 --> 00:02:10,950
Yes they are

110
00:02:11,520 --> 00:02:13,090
They're recording

111
00:02:13,090 --> 00:02:17,630
No Laughing Youthful High School

112
00:02:18,140 --> 00:02:24,100
The morning of the beginning

113
00:02:19,280 --> 00:02:20,940
The morning of the beginning

114
00:02:21,920 --> 00:02:23,970
The soft light of the sun

115
00:02:24,310 --> 00:02:28,270
announces a challenge to the men

116
00:02:24,650 --> 00:02:27,480
announces a challenge to the men

117
00:02:28,050 --> 00:02:29,020
It's freezing...

118
00:02:29,950 --> 00:02:32,070
Poot

119
00:02:32,070 --> 00:02:35,610
You farted, Hamada

120
00:02:32,500 --> 00:02:34,160
Seriously.

121
00:02:33,650 --> 00:02:35,550
It's only been 2 seconds since it started

122
00:02:35,610 --> 00:02:39,050
The sound was like that of a walrus

123
00:02:37,810 --> 00:02:38,970
Seriously

124
00:02:38,360 --> 00:02:39,580
I was being serious

125
00:02:39,000 --> 00:02:41,370
We're so far away, they can't even pick up the sound

126
00:02:40,960 --> 00:02:42,620
That's really not the point

127
00:02:40,980 --> 00:02:42,520
No, no, they can hear it

128
00:02:42,320 --> 00:02:45,550
Sounds like when the parent walrus protects its child

129
00:02:45,550 --> 00:02:48,510
That one's really angry then

130
00:02:48,850 --> 00:02:50,700
Yeah, seriously

131
00:02:50,860 --> 00:02:54,100
"Wait here"

132
00:02:52,000 --> 00:02:53,760
Well, it's the same as always

133
00:02:53,090 --> 00:02:54,450
Right

134
00:02:54,240 --> 00:02:55,340
We'll wait...

135
00:02:55,020 --> 00:02:56,970
No, no. Well, we'll wait but...

136
00:02:56,600 --> 00:02:59,050
We've seen it over a dozen times already

137
00:02:57,760 --> 00:02:59,400
I already feel tired

138
00:02:59,400 --> 00:03:01,740
I just got here, but I'm already tired

139
00:03:01,230 --> 00:03:02,380
Already complaining

140
00:03:01,230 --> 00:03:03,510
It's been a year already. Time sure flies

141
00:03:04,300 --> 00:03:12,810
T/N: The 2019 Rugby World Cup was held in Japan where the Japanese National Team surprisingly made it to quarterfinals despite all odds.

142
00:03:04,300 --> 00:03:12,810
The field is currently being used for rugby practice

143
00:03:06,510 --> 00:03:07,610
Well, well

144
00:03:07,900 --> 00:03:09,620
So this year's rugby...

145
00:03:09,610 --> 00:03:11,270
Right

146
00:03:09,840 --> 00:03:12,500
This year, yeah, they did rugby. It was exciting

147
00:03:11,820 --> 00:03:13,050
It was good

148
00:03:16,530 --> 00:03:16,830
Hey!

149
00:03:16,830 --> 00:03:18,390
Hey!

150
00:03:19,250 --> 00:03:20,990
Oh... I knew it

151
00:03:19,420 --> 00:03:21,760
Heeey!!

152
00:03:21,010 --> 00:03:22,540
Many things have happened recently

153
00:03:22,360 --> 00:03:24,830
So many things happened I wondered how it would go

154
00:03:25,830 --> 00:03:28,000
You're the person who appeared at the press conference right?

155
00:03:25,830 --> 00:03:29,530
T/N: This is referring to the press conference held by Yoshimoto Kogyo (the company who employs Japan's top comedians, including Downtown) about the suspended comedians over a scandal involving a crime group.

156
00:03:28,000 --> 00:03:33,030
Downtown's former manager

157
00:03:28,000 --> 00:03:33,030
Fujiwara Hiroshi

158
00:03:28,400 --> 00:03:29,470
It was good

159
00:03:29,010 --> 00:03:30,050
We watched it

160
00:03:30,050 --> 00:03:32,760
Everyone, I'm glad you came here this year as well

161
00:03:32,350 --> 00:03:33,960
He didn't touch on it at all

162
00:03:33,300 --> 00:03:36,770
He completely ignored what we said

163
00:03:34,010 --> 00:03:35,770
He won't talk about that

164
00:03:35,830 --> 00:03:37,510
Leaving that aside... Wait a little

165
00:03:37,450 --> 00:03:38,820
I don't think it's something to be left aside

166
00:03:39,320 --> 00:03:40,740
Gather here!!

167
00:03:40,760 --> 00:03:43,040
Gather here!

168
00:03:43,660 --> 00:03:44,780
Fall in line!

169
00:03:45,250 --> 00:03:48,280
The rugby players?

170
00:03:46,040 --> 00:03:47,670
Rugby's pretty popular at the moment

171
00:03:46,410 --> 00:03:48,080
So is he the teacher?

172
00:03:48,280 --> 00:03:50,020
Huh?!

173
00:03:48,540 --> 00:03:50,130
I think he's the coach

174
00:03:49,550 --> 00:03:50,740
Coach?

175
00:03:50,370 --> 00:03:51,360
Everyone, gather here!

176
00:03:50,680 --> 00:03:52,450
Huh?!

177
00:03:51,350 --> 00:03:52,450
Huh?!

178
00:03:51,590 --> 00:03:52,450
Wha- No way?!

179
00:03:52,720 --> 00:03:55,020
They're the real deal!!

180
00:03:52,720 --> 00:03:57,550
T/N: These guys are actual players from the Japanese National Team for rugby.

181
00:03:57,570 --> 00:04:01,030
Wow, amazing!!

182
00:04:00,320 --> 00:04:01,640
No, no... What's this?

183
00:04:02,730 --> 00:04:05,370
Surely there's a more meaningful way to incorporate you guys?!

184
00:04:05,370 --> 00:04:10,970
A gathering of Japan's National Team rugby players

185
00:04:06,220 --> 00:04:07,660
Whoa, this is amazing!

186
00:04:07,410 --> 00:04:08,640
This is so extravagant!

187
00:04:09,310 --> 00:04:10,580
Hey, you guys!!

188
00:04:11,110 --> 00:04:13,880
Do you understand why I'm angry?

189
00:04:14,880 --> 00:04:17,580
This year's... No

190
00:04:17,580 --> 00:04:18,650
I said it wrong

191
00:04:17,680 --> 00:04:18,840
That was wrong?!

192
00:04:18,810 --> 00:04:20,950
Pft!!

193
00:04:19,490 --> 00:04:21,280
This quickly? Honestly...

194
00:04:20,490 --> 00:04:22,280
What the hell...

195
00:04:20,780 --> 00:04:22,940
Do you understand why I'm angry?!

196
00:04:23,080 --> 00:04:25,420
It's not because you lost the match

197
00:04:25,460 --> 00:04:26,920
That "it doesn't matter" attitude...

198
00:04:27,000 --> 00:04:27,450
Huh?

199
00:04:27,220 --> 00:04:30,860
It's because I can't forgive that part of your hearts, you fools

200
00:04:30,860 --> 00:04:33,530
In this year's World Cup

201
00:04:32,930 --> 00:04:35,490
Was it like that?

202
00:04:33,530 --> 00:04:35,830
you did a great job being in the Best 8 for the first time in history

203
00:04:35,850 --> 00:04:36,570
But y'know

204
00:04:35,930 --> 00:04:37,090
This is amazing

205
00:04:36,880 --> 00:04:37,650
They're like idols

206
00:04:37,630 --> 00:04:41,500
In the match against South Africa, your score was 3 to 26

207
00:04:39,120 --> 00:04:40,060
This is taking a long time

208
00:04:41,080 --> 00:04:42,510
Who cares about what you have to say?

209
00:04:42,210 --> 00:04:43,420
Don't you find that frustrating?

210
00:04:43,890 --> 00:04:46,980
We do

211
00:04:43,890 --> 00:04:46,980
We do

212
00:04:43,890 --> 00:04:46,980
We do

213
00:04:43,890 --> 00:04:46,980
We do

214
00:04:43,890 --> 00:04:46,980
We do

215
00:04:45,080 --> 00:04:46,120
Right?

216
00:04:45,980 --> 00:04:47,370
It's started

217
00:04:46,920 --> 00:04:49,030
Then, release your frustration

218
00:04:47,240 --> 00:04:47,880
Amazing

219
00:04:49,410 --> 00:04:50,550
Release your frustration using comedy

220
00:04:50,640 --> 00:04:51,620
What the hell?

221
00:04:51,580 --> 00:04:53,480
Inagaki, come here

222
00:04:55,030 --> 00:04:56,900
He doesn't laugh

223
00:04:55,520 --> 00:04:57,530
Right, that's Mr. Inagaki

224
00:04:57,480 --> 00:05:04,060
T/N: Inagaki has an incredibly serious and stoic expression, so he's known as "The Man Who Doesn't Laugh" in Japan.

225
00:04:57,490 --> 00:05:04,060
Inagaki Keita

226
00:04:57,490 --> 00:05:04,060
Man Who Doesn't Laugh

227
00:04:58,200 --> 00:05:00,590
You're known as 'The Man Who Doesn't Laugh'

228
00:05:01,130 --> 00:05:04,760
I'll test to see if you really don't laugh no matter how funny it gets

229
00:05:06,040 --> 00:05:06,790
Now,

230
00:05:06,790 --> 00:05:08,630
I'll be doing the most awesome joke so

231
00:05:08,630 --> 00:05:09,830
Try to hold in your laughter

232
00:05:09,890 --> 00:05:10,720
Here I go

233
00:05:11,870 --> 00:05:14,770
Cha Cha Mambo Chacha Mambo

234
00:05:14,780 --> 00:05:16,170
Bang Bang

235
00:05:16,170 --> 00:05:16,900
Bang Bang

236
00:05:16,920 --> 00:05:17,940
Bang

237
00:05:17,100 --> 00:05:18,040
He's an idiot

238
00:05:17,250 --> 00:05:18,700
That's Kanpei-san

239
00:05:17,940 --> 00:05:20,980
That's Master Kanpei's joke

240
00:05:21,010 --> 00:05:24,440
Bang! Bang! Bang Bang Bang!

241
00:05:27,410 --> 00:05:29,250
Why aren't you laughing?

242
00:05:29,150 --> 00:05:30,820
He must be angry

243
00:05:30,320 --> 00:05:31,990
He must be angry instead

244
00:05:31,610 --> 00:05:32,760
That was the joke and the punchline

245
00:05:32,750 --> 00:05:35,490
I told you not to laugh, but you should've understood that you should've laughed. Enough

246
00:05:35,770 --> 00:05:36,870
You can go back

247
00:05:36,820 --> 00:05:39,260
T/N: The way he said "thanks" was a very informal and shortened way of saying it, like he isn't taking it seriously. Similar to "thx".

248
00:05:36,820 --> 00:05:39,260
Thanks...

249
00:05:39,260 --> 00:05:41,240
He really doesn't laugh

250
00:05:40,940 --> 00:05:42,570
He doesn't laugh...

251
00:05:41,480 --> 00:05:42,840
Yeah

252
00:05:42,730 --> 00:05:45,170
Tanaka, come here

253
00:05:45,170 --> 00:05:50,670
Tanaka Fumiaki

254
00:05:45,170 --> 00:05:50,670
The Small Giant

255
00:05:45,390 --> 00:05:46,420
Oh here he is

256
00:05:46,940 --> 00:05:48,030
I heard

257
00:05:48,690 --> 00:05:50,670
that your wife's a former athlete

258
00:05:50,670 --> 00:05:53,340
And that she's quite beautiful

259
00:05:52,320 --> 00:05:53,340
Yes

260
00:05:53,340 --> 00:05:55,380
You're not being humble at all?

261
00:05:58,210 --> 00:06:02,450
Y-you're on NTV's prime time on New Year's Eve...

262
00:06:01,320 --> 00:06:02,950
He's especially awful today

263
00:06:02,450 --> 00:06:06,150
Oh... What was your wife's name?

264
00:06:03,150 --> 00:06:04,340
This year is really...

265
00:06:05,290 --> 00:06:06,920
It's Tomomi

266
00:06:05,370 --> 00:06:06,690
What the...

267
00:06:06,520 --> 00:06:07,730
Don't forget your lines!

268
00:06:07,690 --> 00:06:10,120
He forgot what he was supposed to say

269
00:06:08,660 --> 00:06:09,690
During NTV's...

270
00:06:11,090 --> 00:06:13,800
prime time on New Year's eve

271
00:06:12,610 --> 00:06:13,860
He's nervous

272
00:06:13,800 --> 00:06:18,170
"Tomomi, I love you!" Let's have you shout that okay?

273
00:06:16,680 --> 00:06:17,710
What the hell?

274
00:06:18,090 --> 00:06:19,280
It won't end until you say that

275
00:06:21,320 --> 00:06:22,680
That's a fairly unreasonable request

276
00:06:22,640 --> 00:06:26,270
Tomomi, I love you!!

277
00:06:24,550 --> 00:06:26,800
Wow, so loudly

278
00:06:26,470 --> 00:06:27,620
She's probably watching

279
00:06:27,340 --> 00:06:28,100
Amazing...

280
00:06:28,440 --> 00:06:30,140
Aren't you embarassed?!

281
00:06:30,130 --> 00:06:31,400
Fine, you may go

282
00:06:31,280 --> 00:06:33,280
He's pretty slow at retorting!!

283
00:06:33,280 --> 00:06:35,220
He was made to say it

284
00:06:34,340 --> 00:06:35,530
He should have retorted more forcefully

285
00:06:35,620 --> 00:06:38,150
Horie, come here

286
00:06:36,150 --> 00:06:36,500
Yes

287
00:06:38,150 --> 00:06:42,290
Captain Dreads

288
00:06:38,150 --> 00:06:42,290
Horie Shouta

289
00:06:39,360 --> 00:06:41,200
You're known for your dreads, Horie

290
00:06:42,390 --> 00:06:46,830
Speaking of the dreads hairstyle,


there's another famous person who had it, right? Who is it?

291
00:06:46,830 --> 00:06:49,300
That would be Bob Marley

292
00:06:48,130 --> 00:06:49,300
Wrong!!

293
00:06:50,360 --> 00:06:51,390
The correct answer is...

294
00:06:52,070 --> 00:06:58,570
That guy who was confused about his TV persona in 2017, Ryuchell

295
00:06:53,660 --> 00:06:57,470
T/N: Ryuchell is a TV personality and model

296
00:06:56,660 --> 00:06:57,470
Ryuchell??

297
00:06:57,560 --> 00:06:58,860
He did used to look like that...

298
00:06:58,830 --> 00:06:59,650
You get it, right?

299
00:07:00,010 --> 00:07:01,440
I understand

300
00:07:01,490 --> 00:07:02,410
What the hell does that mean?

301
00:07:02,940 --> 00:07:03,910
Does he really understand?

302
00:07:03,910 --> 00:07:06,780
Let's have you do a Cheru Cheru Beam shall we?

303
00:07:03,910 --> 00:07:06,780
T/N: Cheru Cheru Beam is Ryuchell's signature move.

304
00:07:07,780 --> 00:07:10,380
Cheru Cheru Beam

305
00:07:09,530 --> 00:07:10,380
What?

306
00:07:10,650 --> 00:07:12,590
Your beam's too intense!

307
00:07:12,540 --> 00:07:15,700
"Beam's too intense..." No, it's your fault...

308
00:07:14,590 --> 00:07:16,860
Is it really okay to treat them like this?

309
00:07:16,090 --> 00:07:17,000
What he said

310
00:07:16,540 --> 00:07:17,830
I feel so sorry for them

311
00:07:16,860 --> 00:07:18,030
Now, Fukuoka

312
00:07:18,460 --> 00:07:19,110
Yes

313
00:07:20,600 --> 00:07:22,230
I heard about you

314
00:07:20,960 --> 00:07:25,300
Fukuoka Kenki

315
00:07:20,960 --> 00:07:25,300
Mr. Scholar Sportsman

316
00:07:22,230 --> 00:07:24,920
I hear you're going to retire after the Tokyo Olympics,

317
00:07:25,300 --> 00:07:30,000
enter a medical school, and aim to become a doctor?

318
00:07:28,250 --> 00:07:30,000
Is that true?

319
00:07:29,100 --> 00:07:30,000
Yes

320
00:07:31,370 --> 00:07:34,710
During the World Cup, you gained a valuable experience, and you're smart

321
00:07:34,710 --> 00:07:35,880
You're a superman

322
00:07:35,880 --> 00:07:37,650
Thank you

323
00:07:37,240 --> 00:07:39,470
After you've become a doctor

324
00:07:40,380 --> 00:07:43,750
A tong-twistie about doctors...

325
00:07:43,750 --> 00:07:49,690
I'll teach you a tongue twister

326
00:07:45,020 --> 00:07:49,690
You definitely can't mess it up

327
00:07:46,360 --> 00:07:47,630
Yeah, that's right

328
00:07:47,710 --> 00:07:49,510
He stumbled those words

329
00:07:49,290 --> 00:07:50,910
His explanation...

330
00:07:49,590 --> 00:07:52,030
How can you stumble over "tongue twister"...

331
00:07:51,560 --> 00:07:54,860
It's "A magician is in the art room doing surgery"

332
00:07:51,560 --> 00:07:54,860
T/N: In Japanese, it's pronounced as, "Majutsushi bijutsushitsude shujutsuchuu". That was hard to even type.

333
00:07:56,000 --> 00:07:58,000
Try saying it 3 times in a row

334
00:07:56,920 --> 00:07:58,160
He didn't trip over his words just now

335
00:07:57,560 --> 00:07:59,010
That's gotta be hard

336
00:07:59,600 --> 00:08:01,740
A magician is in the art room doing surgery

337
00:08:01,750 --> 00:08:03,270
A magician is in the art room doing surgery

338
00:08:03,290 --> 00:08:05,440
A magician is in the art room doing surgery

339
00:08:05,940 --> 00:08:06,710
Wow, amazing

340
00:08:06,710 --> 00:08:07,910
What are you doing by actually managing to do it?

341
00:08:07,910 --> 00:08:09,780
You're breaking the formula of comedy y'know

342
00:08:09,780 --> 00:08:11,010
It's embarassing

343
00:08:11,010 --> 00:08:12,200
You can go back

344
00:08:12,580 --> 00:08:15,450
How high is his position of authority in comedy supposed to be?

345
00:08:17,020 --> 00:08:22,390
You guys actually dare come here with just that level of comedic ability

346
00:08:23,420 --> 00:08:25,030
Don't you want to join Yoshimoto?

347
00:08:25,190 --> 00:08:27,960
We don't!!

348
00:08:25,190 --> 00:08:27,960
We don't!!

349
00:08:25,190 --> 00:08:27,960
We don't!!

350
00:08:25,190 --> 00:08:27,960
We don't!!

351
00:08:25,190 --> 00:08:27,960
We don't!!

352
00:08:28,290 --> 00:08:29,400
They said it so clearly

353
00:08:29,330 --> 00:08:31,870
Then, us too

354
00:08:35,030 --> 00:08:39,010
Many things have happened at Yoshimoto Kogyo

355
00:08:39,040 --> 00:08:44,050
With just average abilities, it's hard to improve the public's impression of Yoshimoto

356
00:08:44,050 --> 00:08:45,850
Is that really okay?

357
00:08:45,850 --> 00:08:48,380
No, it's not!!

358
00:08:45,850 --> 00:08:48,380
No, it's not!!

359
00:08:45,850 --> 00:08:48,380
No, it's not!!

360
00:08:45,850 --> 00:08:48,380
No, it's not!!

361
00:08:45,850 --> 00:08:48,380
No, it's not!!

362
00:08:46,380 --> 00:08:48,050
That's right

363
00:08:48,380 --> 00:08:50,050
I see

364
00:08:50,050 --> 00:08:54,360
You guys and your rotten spirit of comedy

365
00:08:54,350 --> 00:08:55,820
I'll beat it into you from the beginning

366
00:08:57,020 --> 00:09:01,230
Starting now, I will punch you guys!!

367
00:09:01,230 --> 00:09:02,780
First up, Matsuda. Come here!

368
00:09:02,780 --> 00:09:07,370
Genius Kicker

369
00:09:02,780 --> 00:09:07,370
Matsuda Rikiya

370
00:09:02,780 --> 00:09:07,370
Yes!

371
00:09:05,500 --> 00:09:07,200
Isn't this going to be problematic?

372
00:09:07,730 --> 00:09:12,070
With my fist, I will beat it into you. Are you ready?

373
00:09:12,070 --> 00:09:15,610
I am!!

374
00:09:13,610 --> 00:09:16,110
All right, here I come

375
00:09:13,820 --> 00:09:15,820
It'll depend on how he reacts

376
00:09:18,110 --> 00:09:22,150
T/N: Ikeno Medaka is a veteran comedian who is very short in height. His famous skit is similar to this where he tries to fight someone who is bigger without any results.

377
00:09:18,110 --> 00:09:22,150
That's totally Ikeno Medaka

378
00:09:24,590 --> 00:09:26,750
All right. Today's totay...

379
00:09:26,750 --> 00:09:28,060
I'll let you off with just that

380
00:09:28,070 --> 00:09:29,960
Wow, really?

381
00:09:28,530 --> 00:09:29,890
What the hell!

382
00:09:29,220 --> 00:09:33,290
T/N: Falling is a standard reaction in Japanese comedy when something silly happens. Often seen in comedy anime.

383
00:09:29,220 --> 00:09:33,290
They fell!!

384
00:09:31,600 --> 00:09:33,190
We're really sorry

385
00:09:33,290 --> 00:09:34,330
That was awful!

386
00:09:34,330 --> 00:09:35,960
You guys sure fell nicely

387
00:09:35,960 --> 00:09:38,150
It starts on Sunday right? You may leave

388
00:09:36,150 --> 00:09:49,080
Rugby Top League

389
00:09:36,150 --> 00:09:49,080
Starts January 12(Sunday)

390
00:09:38,150 --> 00:09:41,150
Thank you very much!

391
00:09:40,080 --> 00:09:43,100
Extravagant

392
00:09:43,520 --> 00:09:46,060
What extravagant guests

393
00:09:44,020 --> 00:09:46,090
It was amazing

394
00:09:46,370 --> 00:09:49,080
Perhaps they practised falling. Their backs are dirty

395
00:09:49,720 --> 00:09:51,520
Did they practice?

396
00:09:51,410 --> 00:09:53,630
They must have

397
00:09:53,850 --> 00:09:56,820
He's really bad today about remembering his lines

398
00:09:55,820 --> 00:09:59,140
Yeah. I agree

399
00:09:59,140 --> 00:10:01,320
How's that... Hosei

400
00:10:01,320 --> 00:10:03,090
Wha?

401
00:10:03,090 --> 00:10:04,210
It was great, wasn't it?

402
00:10:04,210 --> 00:10:06,610
Ahh.. Yes it was great... The National Team was brilliant

403
00:10:06,450 --> 00:10:07,130
Well...

404
00:10:07,130 --> 00:10:08,700
You're wrong!

405
00:10:08,700 --> 00:10:12,270
It's youth! YOUTH!

406
00:10:12,340 --> 00:10:13,640
Well with that

407
00:10:14,140 --> 00:10:18,910
This year's theme is Youthful High School!

408
00:10:17,640 --> 00:10:18,000
Whaat...

409
00:10:18,910 --> 00:10:22,210
Youthful High School?

410
00:10:19,480 --> 00:10:20,540
...High school?

411
00:10:21,660 --> 00:10:23,470
Going back to school...

412
00:10:22,610 --> 00:10:23,710
We're completely...

413
00:10:23,710 --> 00:10:25,280
Going back to where we started

414
00:10:25,280 --> 00:10:33,150
24 Hour High School Lifestyle Challenge

415
00:10:25,280 --> 00:10:33,150
Era of Youthful High School Students

416
00:10:26,080 --> 00:10:33,150
And so, back to the era of Youthful High School as students, they're challenged with 24 hours of the student lifestyle

417
00:10:28,380 --> 00:10:30,360
They use that same photo every single time, don't they?

418
00:10:30,360 --> 00:10:32,450
Isn't that photo just horrible!?

419
00:10:34,060 --> 00:10:36,660
You say you're high schoolers, what are you doing in those clothes?

420
00:10:36,960 --> 00:10:38,590
I just asked that

421
00:10:38,590 --> 00:10:40,060
Over there a change of clothes is waiting for you

422
00:10:40,060 --> 00:10:44,430
Hey, I just asked that

423
00:10:40,700 --> 00:10:41,570
You're so annoying

424
00:10:44,910 --> 00:10:47,930
Prep..  pre... What's with those clothes?!

425
00:10:47,930 --> 00:10:50,970
You're meant to be high schoolers

426
00:10:51,640 --> 00:10:52,480
What is with you?

427
00:10:52,010 --> 00:10:54,910
If we wore high school uniforms from the start it'd be weird, wouldn't it?

428
00:10:53,480 --> 00:10:54,910
Yeah

429
00:10:54,910 --> 00:10:55,920
Yeah

430
00:10:54,910 --> 00:10:56,780
Well we don't know

431
00:10:56,780 --> 00:10:58,550
Yeah!

432
00:10:59,320 --> 00:11:01,110
Yeah

433
00:10:59,720 --> 00:11:01,330
We don't know

434
00:11:00,000 --> 00:11:02,120
Yeah let's keep going

435
00:11:02,420 --> 00:11:09,220
From now on, high schoolers... YOU GUYS!!

436
00:11:09,040 --> 00:11:10,280
Panic...

437
00:11:10,020 --> 00:11:13,030
Okay that's enough

438
00:11:10,280 --> 00:11:12,280
What were you expecting?

439
00:11:13,030 --> 00:11:14,050
Panic...

440
00:11:13,740 --> 00:11:14,970
It's been a while...

441
00:11:13,760 --> 00:11:16,050
He was really out of his rhythm there

442
00:11:15,690 --> 00:11:16,680
He was, wasn't he

443
00:11:17,500 --> 00:11:22,770
Oh! It's different

444
00:11:20,030 --> 00:11:21,050
Oh you're right

445
00:11:21,400 --> 00:11:22,770
The order?

446
00:11:22,770 --> 00:11:25,160
It'll depend on which way it opens

447
00:11:24,030 --> 00:11:25,160
Yes

448
00:11:24,290 --> 00:11:26,250
Yes, from the way it opens...

449
00:11:26,240 --> 00:11:27,690
Yes, but...

450
00:11:28,270 --> 00:11:29,080
Change of clothes complete

451
00:11:28,340 --> 00:11:29,080
change  ofclothes complete

452
00:11:28,410 --> 00:11:29,080
Change of clothes complete

453
00:11:28,470 --> 00:11:29,080
Change of clothes complete

454
00:11:29,040 --> 00:11:30,030
Change of clothes complete

455
00:11:29,080 --> 00:11:32,950
Change of clothes complete

456
00:11:33,880 --> 00:11:35,120
Are you all ready?

457
00:11:35,520 --> 00:11:37,590
I'll have you all to come out in order

458
00:11:37,590 --> 00:11:38,510
Hosei, you first

459
00:11:41,320 --> 00:11:42,200
Oh, Hosei

460
00:11:42,460 --> 00:11:44,360
Aren't you cute?

461
00:11:43,560 --> 00:11:44,820
Thank you

462
00:11:44,360 --> 00:11:47,460
You could easily pass as a real high schooler

463
00:11:47,460 --> 00:11:48,850
You're adorable!

464
00:11:49,250 --> 00:11:50,060
Thanks

465
00:11:50,160 --> 00:11:51,130
Endo, you're next

466
00:11:54,530 --> 00:11:57,610
Very manly, just as I thought

467
00:11:57,610 --> 00:12:00,570
High school girls won't be able to keep themselves away

468
00:11:59,580 --> 00:12:00,490
Thank you!

469
00:12:01,110 --> 00:12:02,650
Alright! Next is Tanaka

470
00:12:07,210 --> 00:12:10,150
Very intelligent, looking very smart

471
00:12:10,650 --> 00:12:11,190
Thank you!

472
00:12:10,980 --> 00:12:13,020
Looking good

473
00:12:13,170 --> 00:12:13,940
Alright, Hamada!

474
00:12:17,530 --> 00:12:17,960
Oh

475
00:12:18,290 --> 00:12:22,030
The same bobbed style wig used every time

476
00:12:18,720 --> 00:12:21,590
Again?

477
00:12:22,330 --> 00:12:24,300
You're right on the borderline of the school regulations

478
00:12:25,030 --> 00:12:27,570
You prepared your own wig again

479
00:12:27,610 --> 00:12:29,400
This isn't mine, you know

480
00:12:27,760 --> 00:12:29,400
"Your own wig..."

481
00:12:29,700 --> 00:12:32,140
It's your own wig if you've come this far with it

482
00:12:30,800 --> 00:12:32,140
It seems like it

483
00:12:32,140 --> 00:12:32,910
It's not

484
00:12:33,110 --> 00:12:34,140
You really should stop

485
00:12:34,140 --> 00:12:35,740
Alright, Matsumoto come on out!

486
00:12:39,240 --> 00:12:40,330
That's super tight

487
00:12:40,810 --> 00:12:42,980
You look like you're about to burst

488
00:12:41,910 --> 00:12:43,690
What is this?

489
00:12:44,080 --> 00:12:47,520
A uniform that emphasizes Matsumoto's muscles

490
00:12:45,860 --> 00:12:47,120
It's a bit tight...

491
00:12:47,120 --> 00:12:48,000
It's gross...

492
00:12:47,520 --> 00:12:48,880
Is... That supposed to be a gakuran?

493
00:12:47,520 --> 00:12:48,880
T/N: Gakuran is the standard uniform for high school boys which is styled after Western clothing. It is usually a long sleeved black uniform with large buttons and a high collar.

494
00:12:48,880 --> 00:12:49,960
It's so gross...

495
00:12:49,960 --> 00:12:51,330
Is it that bad?

496
00:12:51,740 --> 00:12:53,820
It's skin-tight, looks like a wetsuit

497
00:12:54,560 --> 00:12:58,270
It's not a stretchy fabric

498
00:12:56,440 --> 00:12:57,680
What is this?

499
00:12:57,560 --> 00:12:58,270
It looks so hard to move in...

500
00:12:58,270 --> 00:13:01,070
You want to show off your muscles that much?

501
00:13:01,070 --> 00:13:04,540
It was there so I put it on...

502
00:13:02,720 --> 00:13:03,800
Oh so it's like that?

503
00:13:04,610 --> 00:13:06,470
What is this?

504
00:13:06,470 --> 00:13:08,140
Ok so everyone's ready

505
00:13:08,240 --> 00:13:17,450
No laughing rules

506
00:13:08,860 --> 00:13:17,450
During school life,

507
00:13:09,030 --> 00:13:17,450
you must not laugh

508
00:13:09,050 --> 00:13:17,450
The rules are simple: While you live out your school life, you must not laugh. That is all

509
00:13:17,820 --> 00:13:19,320
There's a bus station over there

510
00:13:19,320 --> 00:13:22,690
So let's go to school, shall we?

511
00:13:26,660 --> 00:13:30,200
There's no hats this time

512
00:13:30,200 --> 00:13:31,460
Getting closer to the start, tensions rise

513
00:13:30,200 --> 00:13:37,370
Getting closer to the start, tensions rise

514
00:13:30,200 --> 00:13:37,370
Getting closer to the start, tensions rise

515
00:13:38,240 --> 00:13:41,280
Let's wait here

516
00:13:42,540 --> 00:13:45,580
It's here, the bus is here

517
00:13:45,580 --> 00:13:46,620
It's so bright...

518
00:13:48,580 --> 00:13:49,650
It's here...

519
00:13:49,480 --> 00:13:52,290
It's here

520
00:13:49,480 --> 00:13:52,290
It's here

521
00:13:52,600 --> 00:13:55,780
Prefectural... Heipo...

522
00:13:56,680 --> 00:13:58,440
...Omamegaoka?

523
00:13:59,830 --> 00:14:01,830
It's so plain every year

524
00:14:01,660 --> 00:14:02,430
Yes it is, like...

525
00:14:03,100 --> 00:14:06,400
Omamegaoka High School

526
00:14:04,760 --> 00:14:05,600
Let's get on

527
00:14:06,400 --> 00:14:10,870
This umm... Ok?

528
00:14:10,870 --> 00:14:12,080
Heipo Omamegaoka High School

529
00:14:12,990 --> 00:14:15,110
This is the school we're going to

530
00:14:23,010 --> 00:14:25,780
This bus that depicts the founding school principal,

531
00:14:25,780 --> 00:14:27,040
Heipo

532
00:14:27,590 --> 00:14:28,190
Heading to Omamegaoka High School

533
00:14:27,590 --> 00:14:32,590
Heading to Omamegaoka High School

534
00:14:32,690 --> 00:14:36,160
Let's all just get on the bus together

535
00:14:34,920 --> 00:14:36,160
This year

536
00:14:36,160 --> 00:14:41,370
One person alone getting on, in many ways, it doesn't feel right

537
00:14:39,820 --> 00:14:41,370
Ok then, let's all get on

538
00:14:41,670 --> 00:14:44,270
Here we go

539
00:14:44,450 --> 00:14:50,830
Absolutely No Laughing Youthful High School 24 Hours

540
00:14:50,830 --> 00:14:51,570
Nope

541
00:14:52,110 --> 00:14:53,950
Nope

542
00:14:55,820 --> 00:14:58,020
What?

543
00:14:57,200 --> 00:15:00,020
No! No!

544
00:15:00,020 --> 00:15:01,750
No! No one was riding!

545
00:15:00,020 --> 00:15:01,750
You got on it!

546
00:15:01,080 --> 00:15:03,020
You rode it!

547
00:15:01,140 --> 00:15:02,590
You were riding!

548
00:15:02,280 --> 00:15:04,360
This is too much!

549
00:15:04,360 --> 00:15:06,360
I even got on for you guys

550
00:15:06,530 --> 00:15:09,280
I even rode it for a second for you guys

551
00:15:11,300 --> 00:15:14,070
No, not in this underwear!!

552
00:15:13,840 --> 00:15:14,660
Yeah

553
00:15:14,070 --> 00:15:16,000
That'd really hurt...

554
00:15:15,120 --> 00:15:15,990
Advance!

555
00:15:15,990 --> 00:15:19,750
Why did that happen?

556
00:15:16,870 --> 00:15:24,280
If they laugh, their butts will get smacked

557
00:15:19,990 --> 00:15:21,660
If you ride it, you've already started

558
00:15:21,120 --> 00:15:22,060
Yeah...

559
00:15:21,660 --> 00:15:23,230
So if we ride it, we've already started...

560
00:15:23,230 --> 00:15:25,400
Right now only you have started

561
00:15:25,650 --> 00:15:27,510
I said let's ride the bus together

562
00:15:27,820 --> 00:15:28,600
Fine,

563
00:15:28,880 --> 00:15:31,620
You don't need to wait there!!

564
00:15:32,020 --> 00:15:34,020
I really hate the fact that he thinks there's going to be another chance

565
00:15:34,020 --> 00:15:36,390
He's in camouflage and yet he's so visible

566
00:15:37,990 --> 00:15:39,530
Let's just get on

567
00:15:39,530 --> 00:15:41,530
Ok, ok

568
00:15:46,400 --> 00:15:47,670
He's laughing! He's laughing!

569
00:15:47,670 --> 00:15:49,900
He's so laughing!

570
00:15:48,900 --> 00:15:50,680
You were so laughing

571
00:15:50,260 --> 00:15:51,800
I was not

572
00:15:51,800 --> 00:15:53,330
He laughed just then

573
00:15:52,810 --> 00:15:55,540
He was totally laughing just now

574
00:15:53,890 --> 00:15:55,820
He was so laughing

575
00:15:56,080 --> 00:15:59,980
Hurry get on the bus. Look

576
00:16:00,550 --> 00:16:02,360
Well I already laughed so...

577
00:16:02,720 --> 00:16:03,350
Shall we get on?

578
00:16:03,350 --> 00:16:05,590
I will get on

579
00:16:05,790 --> 00:16:06,400
Alright

580
00:16:07,690 --> 00:16:08,960
Everyone START

581
00:16:08,970 --> 00:16:10,090
Departing for school, what lies ahead!?

582
00:16:09,360 --> 00:16:17,500
Departing for school, what lies ahead!?

583
00:16:19,070 --> 00:16:23,540
Well at least the weather was really great

584
00:16:22,340 --> 00:16:23,790
Yes, it's very nice

585
00:16:25,840 --> 00:16:29,380
It's the kind of day you'd take a picture for a pamphlet

586
00:16:29,540 --> 00:16:33,780
Super
famous
person

587
00:16:29,540 --> 00:16:37,720
The first act is this unexpected person!!

588
00:16:33,780 --> 00:16:37,720
Super
famous
person

589
00:16:34,280 --> 00:16:37,720
I wanted to meet under
normal circumstances!

590
00:16:38,220 --> 00:16:47,330
The first act is this unexpected person

591
00:16:50,260 --> 00:16:52,930
Arrival at the bus station

592
00:16:50,330 --> 00:16:52,930
Arrival at the bus station

593
00:16:50,400 --> 00:16:52,930
Arrival atthe busstation

594
00:16:50,480 --> 00:16:52,930
Arrival at the bus station

595
00:16:51,030 --> 00:16:52,160
Arrival at the bus station

596
00:16:59,100 --> 00:16:59,510
Hi

597
00:17:01,720 --> 00:17:05,180
From now I'm going to take part in the bus joke, but

598
00:17:01,720 --> 00:17:05,180
Kotoge Eiji

599
00:17:01,720 --> 00:17:05,180
Mysterious Man

600
00:17:05,180 --> 00:17:07,850
But the joke is a bit too aggressive

601
00:17:08,480 --> 00:17:09,850
It's frankly scary

602
00:17:09,850 --> 00:17:10,700
By the way,

603
00:17:10,980 --> 00:17:13,520
Do you know what kind of joke this is?

604
00:17:13,630 --> 00:17:14,160
Hamada?

605
00:17:14,340 --> 00:17:16,440
Well, you're holding the film clapper

606
00:17:16,560 --> 00:17:18,890
So something about a drama or movie?

607
00:17:17,310 --> 00:17:19,190
...Drama or movie. Matsumoto?

608
00:17:20,100 --> 00:17:21,970
Well...

609
00:17:22,090 --> 00:17:24,600
Maybe a variety show?

610
00:17:22,920 --> 00:17:23,640
Ok variety

611
00:17:24,880 --> 00:17:26,500
Well actually, in fact,

612
00:17:27,600 --> 00:17:29,900
Ze... Director Muranishi's...

613
00:17:29,900 --> 00:17:33,710
Director Muranishi's works

614
00:17:33,710 --> 00:17:34,920
It became quite the topic this year,

615
00:17:33,710 --> 00:17:41,680
Kotoge's Anxiety

616
00:17:33,710 --> 00:17:41,680
T/N: Director Toru Muranishi is an infamous Japanese adult video director. He is known as "the dirtiest of the industry's dirty old men" and "Emperor of Porn".

617
00:17:33,710 --> 00:17:41,680
Topic this year! Joke about Director Muranishi being too aggressive

618
00:17:36,140 --> 00:17:38,480
But the joke was a bit too much...

619
00:17:37,960 --> 00:17:39,550
Wait, will this be ok?

620
00:17:39,160 --> 00:17:41,680
I know, I'm worried too, but

621
00:17:41,680 --> 00:17:46,490
But because there's someone who wants to do it no matter what,

622
00:17:44,050 --> 00:17:46,490
would you be willing to watch it?

623
00:17:46,990 --> 00:17:47,890
Ok come on in!

624
00:17:48,640 --> 00:17:49,920
Thank you for waiting!!

625
00:17:49,920 --> 00:17:53,160
I may have made you wait too long

626
00:17:54,960 --> 00:17:56,530
NO WAY!!

627
00:17:57,750 --> 00:17:58,670
Seriously!?

628
00:18:00,400 --> 00:18:07,310
Director Muranishi is unexpectedly played by Tsuyoshi Kusanagi

629
00:18:00,400 --> 00:18:07,310
Kotoge's Anxiety #2

630
00:18:00,400 --> 00:18:07,310
T/N: Tsuyoshi Kusanagi was one of the members of one of the most famous Japanese boy bands, SMAP. They disbanded in 2016 due to leaving the Johnny & Associates agency, but the members still remain active in the media.

631
00:18:00,840 --> 00:18:02,620
This one was really surprising

632
00:18:02,490 --> 00:18:04,620
It's too weird

633
00:18:06,590 --> 00:18:07,950
Too soon!

634
00:18:07,910 --> 00:18:10,140
You're an idiot!!

635
00:18:10,140 --> 00:18:13,280
I have come back to Nippon TV!

636
00:18:10,140 --> 00:18:13,280
T/N: Nippon TV is the broadcasting station that Gaki no Tsukai is on.

637
00:18:12,970 --> 00:18:14,250
I didn't think you could!

638
00:18:14,250 --> 00:18:17,050
You have such a great expression

639
00:18:17,820 --> 00:18:21,050
Very nice, very nice

640
00:18:21,820 --> 00:18:25,260
It's been a while, having this kind of reunion

641
00:18:25,790 --> 00:18:29,570
Why do I have to get hit for this?!

642
00:18:26,490 --> 00:18:33,470
Kotoge's Anxiety #3

643
00:18:26,490 --> 00:18:33,470
Long time reunion,
but only has underwear on

644
00:18:31,490 --> 00:18:33,470
That was rough, wasn't it?

645
00:18:33,090 --> 00:18:35,470
Don't say, "Nice!"

646
00:18:34,230 --> 00:18:36,470
Isn't this television?

647
00:18:36,470 --> 00:18:38,040
Isn't this over the air television?

648
00:18:38,040 --> 00:18:41,710
Oh, it's you, Macchan! Oh, it's you, Hama-chan

649
00:18:41,710 --> 00:18:43,440
It's been so long, having this kind of...

650
00:18:43,440 --> 00:18:47,480
I wanted to

meet normally

651
00:18:47,800 --> 00:18:49,000
No, this isn't it!

652
00:18:48,690 --> 00:18:50,820
Ah, this atmosphere is nostalgic

653
00:18:48,700 --> 00:18:50,820
Man...

654
00:18:48,700 --> 00:18:50,820
So sudden

655
00:18:50,520 --> 00:18:52,180
You're the one creating this atmosphere

656
00:18:53,730 --> 00:18:55,310
It would have been better if we could meet normally...

657
00:18:55,940 --> 00:18:58,220
Very very nice

658
00:18:58,720 --> 00:19:03,700
I want to bring out everyone's raw instinct,






and store it in this camera...

659
00:19:04,660 --> 00:19:08,430
You thought it'd be an actor advertising their new drama didn't you?

660
00:19:08,430 --> 00:19:10,430
Well, like, we had no idea...

661
00:19:08,960 --> 00:19:12,860
T/N: There's too many people named Yamada, so I'm not sure which one he's referring to. Possibly Yamada Yuuki?

662
00:19:08,960 --> 00:19:12,860
Yeah, we thought it might be Yamada or someone like that

663
00:19:13,070 --> 00:19:17,710
I'm Tsuyoshi Muranishi

664
00:19:13,070 --> 00:19:17,710
T/N: Tsuyoshi is the first name of the SMAP member, Muranishi is the last name of the porn director.

665
00:19:18,290 --> 00:19:21,560
I said I wish we could've met normally

666
00:19:21,010 --> 00:19:22,120
Can you stop?

667
00:19:21,480 --> 00:19:29,420
Getting too into it

668
00:19:21,480 --> 00:19:29,420
Kotoge's Anxiety #4

669
00:19:21,880 --> 00:19:23,980
I'm saying it would have been better if this was more normal

670
00:19:25,920 --> 00:19:28,050
It says "Kotoge's Anxiety" on there

671
00:19:29,470 --> 00:19:31,340
Such a great expression

672
00:19:31,590 --> 00:19:33,430
Can you stop?

673
00:19:32,480 --> 00:19:35,680
It's too aggressive

674
00:19:32,590 --> 00:19:33,430
No, it's interesting

675
00:19:33,430 --> 00:19:36,120
This... This is what he wanted to do

676
00:19:36,130 --> 00:19:39,100
It's my first time on TV for a while,







and I'm really nervous

677
00:19:40,030 --> 00:19:43,400
I'm going around in circles, but it'd be great if you could kindly watch

678
00:19:44,500 --> 00:19:47,440
ACTION!

679
00:19:49,180 --> 00:19:50,230
Please...

680
00:19:50,230 --> 00:19:51,530
This is crazy

681
00:19:51,540 --> 00:19:55,230
Yeah, now you just say those things, you're just saying them with no hesitations

682
00:19:52,410 --> 00:19:56,880
Kotoge's Anxiety #5

683
00:19:52,410 --> 00:19:56,880
Too straight with his intentions

684
00:19:55,920 --> 00:19:57,810
Yeah it just kind of comes out, right?

685
00:19:59,470 --> 00:19:59,990
Action!

686
00:19:59,890 --> 00:20:01,820
No, not action, man

687
00:20:01,820 --> 00:20:05,220
If you come on too strong, no one is going to react at all

688
00:20:05,930 --> 00:20:07,260
You're being too aggressive, I've been telling you, man

689
00:20:07,260 --> 00:20:09,530
When it's time to be dominant, I have to dominate

690
00:20:10,000 --> 00:20:13,300
I told you: the one thing you can't do is come out here naked, man!

691
00:20:13,300 --> 00:20:16,840
Have you forgotten that obnoxious thing you did

692
00:20:15,500 --> 00:20:16,840
all those years ago?

693
00:20:17,230 --> 00:20:18,570
Do you regret nothing?

694
00:20:18,710 --> 00:20:19,540
I regret that

695
00:20:19,540 --> 00:20:24,840
I might regret that TOO much

696
00:20:19,540 --> 00:20:24,840
T/N: Kusanagi was arrested in 2009 for public indecency. He held a press conference to apologize and prosecutors decided to not indict.

697
00:20:24,840 --> 00:20:26,130
Doesn't really seem like it

698
00:20:26,130 --> 00:20:28,810
Come on

699
00:20:28,610 --> 00:20:33,990
He makes everything a joke

700
00:20:28,610 --> 00:20:33,990
Kotoge's Anxiety #6

701
00:20:32,200 --> 00:20:33,240
Uh...

702
00:20:34,420 --> 00:20:37,360
Amazing, he'll even say that

703
00:20:37,580 --> 00:20:39,990
So, up till a few years ago

704
00:20:40,130 --> 00:20:43,500
You were in a competing time slot, it seems

705
00:20:44,130 --> 00:20:46,000
Is it really okay for you to do something this dumb?

706
00:20:46,080 --> 00:20:46,930
I'm here to fight

707
00:20:47,070 --> 00:20:49,470
Is my verdict fair? Or is it unfair?

708
00:20:50,200 --> 00:20:52,110
I want to judge it as Red or White

709
00:20:50,200 --> 00:20:55,110
T/N: The "judge it as red or white" was supposed to be "judge as black or white" in English, meaning to settle a matter. However, in Japanese, "red and white" is "Kouhaku" which is the name of the Batsu's rival New Year's Eve TV special that SMAP has repeatedly hosted.

710
00:20:50,840 --> 00:20:52,110
White or Black, you mean

711
00:20:52,300 --> 00:20:56,510
GIVE IT UP ALREADY!

712
00:20:59,540 --> 00:21:01,120
They're a good combination!

713
00:21:00,650 --> 00:21:03,120
The timing is great

714
00:21:04,990 --> 00:21:06,620
Nice~

715
00:21:05,900 --> 00:21:07,180
You aren't looking nice~ yet

716
00:21:07,300 --> 00:21:08,500
No, this is not nice~

717
00:21:08,290 --> 00:21:10,960
2019 was nice, too~

718
00:21:08,290 --> 00:21:10,960
T/N: 2019 is a reference to Director Muranishi getting a semi-autobiographical series "The Naked Director" on Netflix.

719
00:21:09,490 --> 00:21:10,960
Nice nice, director

720
00:21:10,960 --> 00:21:13,220
Should we use that thing that

721
00:21:13,740 --> 00:21:15,040
Director Muranishi is known for most?

722
00:21:14,920 --> 00:21:17,040
Let's do it! Very nice~

723
00:21:16,630 --> 00:21:23,440
Director Muranishi's Legendary Conch

724
00:21:16,630 --> 00:21:23,440
T/N: Muranishi had actresses blow into a conch shell when they reach climax. It apparently is a reference to some Buddhist rituals.

725
00:21:17,710 --> 00:21:18,890
Use this, use this

726
00:21:19,300 --> 00:21:20,080
Isn't it great?

727
00:21:20,670 --> 00:21:23,440
From now on I'd like you to use those to verify some things

728
00:21:24,200 --> 00:21:28,970
I want to gape wide open the true nature of you two comedians

729
00:21:28,970 --> 00:21:30,440
Now I'm going to ask some questions

730
00:21:30,800 --> 00:21:32,220
Twice for a yes

731
00:21:32,650 --> 00:21:34,060
Just once if it's a no

732
00:21:34,280 --> 00:21:35,750
Please blow those conch shells

733
00:21:35,880 --> 00:22:10,730
Answer the director   2 for YES   1 for NO

734
00:21:35,880 --> 00:22:36,810
m 1.5 915 l 1920 915 l 1920 975 l 0 975

735
00:21:36,020 --> 00:21:36,810
All right?

736
00:21:37,480 --> 00:21:41,220
You, with the jeans that I really like

737
00:21:42,260 --> 00:21:43,740
Answer honestly, did you think you'd never

738
00:21:43,760 --> 00:21:45,620
be involved with me ever again?

739
00:21:44,120 --> 00:21:51,500
Q. You didn't think you'd ever be involved with me ever again

740
00:21:48,160 --> 00:21:51,100
Oh that's so lonely, but nice!

741
00:21:51,480 --> 00:21:53,380
That's so human, so human!

742
00:21:53,680 --> 00:21:55,920
Let's have this one go

743
00:21:56,180 --> 00:21:57,280
This comedian

744
00:21:57,850 --> 00:22:03,300
So, which are you? Team Kusanagi? Team Nakai?

745
00:22:03,680 --> 00:22:10,030
T/N: Kusanagi and Nakai are both members of SMAP. Nakai has been one of the more popular members due to always hosting shows, being a newscaster, etc.

746
00:22:03,680 --> 00:22:36,810
Q. Are you Team Kusanagi or Team Nakai?

747
00:22:04,510 --> 00:22:05,370
Which is it?

748
00:22:05,370 --> 00:22:07,570
If you're Team Kusanagi, blow twice

749
00:22:07,930 --> 00:22:10,030
Blow once for Team Nakai

750
00:22:08,510 --> 00:22:10,200
What the hell?

751
00:22:10,200 --> 00:22:11,020
What?

752
00:22:10,730 --> 00:22:11,230
Answer the director  2 for Team Kusanagi  1 for Team Nakai

753
00:22:10,730 --> 00:22:36,810
Answer the director  2 for Team Kusanagi  1 for Team Nakai

754
00:22:10,900 --> 00:22:11,980
What the?

755
00:22:11,730 --> 00:22:13,020
The hell?

756
00:22:13,290 --> 00:22:15,820
What is this?

757
00:22:14,000 --> 00:22:16,820
Twice for Kusanagi

758
00:22:17,100 --> 00:22:18,540
Once for Nakai

759
00:22:18,760 --> 00:22:19,860
Blow the conch, please!

760
00:22:18,810 --> 00:22:20,330
Let's go

761
00:22:19,860 --> 00:22:22,330
That's really hard, though!

762
00:22:21,630 --> 00:22:22,850
Please blow the conch

763
00:22:23,050 --> 00:22:23,820
Macchan

764
00:22:24,990 --> 00:22:25,640
Macchan?

765
00:22:29,920 --> 00:22:33,320
Good! Nice! Nice!

766
00:22:37,860 --> 00:22:41,300
I don't get it!

767
00:22:41,680 --> 00:22:44,260
I didn't get it earlier, either, because I'm not on either team

768
00:22:44,930 --> 00:22:46,480
So why would you ask about my team, right?

769
00:22:47,150 --> 00:22:49,090
I'm not on any damn team...

770
00:22:48,460 --> 00:22:50,460
But why?

771
00:22:49,710 --> 00:22:50,730
I don't have one

772
00:22:50,490 --> 00:22:52,490
Try blowing it one more time

773
00:22:53,810 --> 00:22:54,830
Why?

774
00:22:54,390 --> 00:23:13,150
Answer the director  2 for Team Kusanagi  1 for Team Nakai

775
00:22:54,390 --> 00:23:13,150
Q. Are you Team Kusanagi or Team Nakai?

776
00:22:54,390 --> 00:23:13,150
m 1.5 915 l 1920 915 l 1920 975 l 0 975

777
00:22:56,840 --> 00:22:57,810
Blow it harder!

778
00:22:58,180 --> 00:22:58,910
Nakai?

779
00:23:00,010 --> 00:23:01,070
You like Nakai?

780
00:23:02,450 --> 00:23:04,930
Very good very good VERY GOOD

781
00:23:04,930 --> 00:23:06,930
That's nice! That's nice!

782
00:23:07,490 --> 00:23:08,570
That's nice!

783
00:23:08,570 --> 00:23:13,020
Calm yourself down already, man, making him go pipipipi like that

784
00:23:13,880 --> 00:23:17,450
This whole segment is probably going to be unusable...

785
00:23:17,450 --> 00:23:19,450
Shouldn't you spend your time more on asking about

786
00:23:19,700 --> 00:23:21,620
Director Muranishi's specialties?

787
00:23:21,140 --> 00:23:22,250
You're right, I was too caught up in the moment

788
00:23:22,250 --> 00:23:24,850
Ask some normal questions, would you?

789
00:23:22,260 --> 00:23:27,960
Director Muranishi thrusts his specialties

790
00:23:25,440 --> 00:23:27,960
So Hamachan... Hamachan, I'll bet

791
00:23:27,960 --> 00:23:29,960
Do you like old clothes?

792
00:23:30,440 --> 00:23:32,660
Well, maybe, I don't hate them

793
00:23:32,660 --> 00:23:36,300
You always wear Levi 501XX, do you not?

794
00:23:37,400 --> 00:23:38,870
Well, I own some

795
00:23:39,740 --> 00:23:44,610
You used to wear bigger ones but lately they're tighter...

796
00:23:41,960 --> 00:23:44,680
Oh, oh really?

797
00:23:43,870 --> 00:23:46,310
He could tell the difference, wow

798
00:23:46,080 --> 00:23:48,080
I wish I could pull off old clothes

799
00:23:47,640 --> 00:23:48,430
Oh, I see

800
00:23:49,220 --> 00:23:51,470
I've been thinking of changing my stylist-

801
00:23:49,900 --> 00:23:55,220
What's with these garbage questions!?

802
00:23:55,220 --> 00:23:58,390
What kind of backwater hick would care!?

803
00:24:03,850 --> 00:24:04,480
Oh me too?

804
00:24:08,800 --> 00:24:09,940
Now Macchan

805
00:24:11,850 --> 00:24:13,910
Please, ask him an appropriate question

806
00:24:13,910 --> 00:24:16,210
I could go for something more appropriate...

807
00:24:15,320 --> 00:24:16,110
That's too far, isn't it?

808
00:24:16,710 --> 00:24:20,680
During your private time, what do you like to do?

809
00:24:21,120 --> 00:24:23,120
Sorry, I know it's cliché

810
00:24:23,350 --> 00:24:25,350
But go to the gym and stuff

811
00:24:25,550 --> 00:24:28,050
Do you ever go out drinking?

812
00:24:26,820 --> 00:24:28,050
I go out a bit

813
00:24:28,050 --> 00:24:31,190
Do you go out with Nakai-kun?

814
00:24:28,980 --> 00:24:29,640
He asked again

815
00:24:31,190 --> 00:24:36,100
Generally, I go out with him twice a month or so...

816
00:24:34,860 --> 00:24:36,090
Oh really?

817
00:24:36,090 --> 00:24:42,970
Do you talk about me or anything like that?

818
00:24:40,230 --> 00:24:42,970
I wouldn't say that we don't...

819
00:24:43,970 --> 00:24:47,070
Do you ever talk about Atarashii Chizu with Nakai-kun?

820
00:24:43,970 --> 00:24:50,110
T/N: Atarashii Chizu is a band compromised of some of the previous members of SMAP: Goro Inagaki, Tsuyoshi Kusanagi, and Shingo Katori. Nakai and Kimura (the two most popular members) are not in the band.

821
00:24:46,360 --> 00:24:47,950
Not that I remember

822
00:24:47,070 --> 00:24:50,110
Do you talk about Goro-chan? Do you talk about Shingo-chan?

823
00:24:49,170 --> 00:24:52,840
You're being too aggressive again...

824
00:24:49,420 --> 00:24:51,450
Not really...

825
00:24:51,840 --> 00:24:55,320
Does he ever talk about being a presenter or anything?

826
00:24:52,980 --> 00:24:55,170
Honestly we don't really

827
00:24:54,900 --> 00:24:57,630
You're being too aggressive, Director...

828
00:24:55,250 --> 00:24:56,260
Talk about that stuff

829
00:24:55,740 --> 00:24:57,630
Oh really? That's great

830
00:24:57,980 --> 00:24:58,680
Yeah it's great...

831
00:24:59,490 --> 00:25:01,050
When will you see him next?

832
00:25:01,890 --> 00:25:04,620
We haven't planned anything specific...

833
00:25:03,500 --> 00:25:05,970
Nothing specific, huh? Really.

834
00:25:07,630 --> 00:25:08,530
What do you think about Atarashii Chizu?

835
00:25:08,540 --> 00:25:11,730
What do you think about Atarashii Chizu?

836
00:25:13,580 --> 00:25:15,220
This asshole never stops!

837
00:25:24,050 --> 00:25:26,610
TV is the best!!

838
00:25:26,620 --> 00:25:27,910
Internet streaming is good, but broadcast TV is really great, right?

839
00:25:27,920 --> 00:25:29,850
Internet streaming is good, but broadcast TV is really great, right?

840
00:25:32,090 --> 00:25:35,190
I have a feeling we'll be seeing each other again soon

841
00:25:35,260 --> 00:25:37,320
That's good, okay, that's plenty

842
00:25:36,510 --> 00:25:38,910
2019 was great

843
00:25:38,750 --> 00:25:39,730
We get it

844
00:25:39,730 --> 00:25:40,760
Let's have another great year

845
00:25:40,760 --> 00:25:41,440
Yes, let's

846
00:25:43,510 --> 00:25:45,120
He had a huge impact

847
00:25:46,280 --> 00:25:49,050
Kusanagi came back this year

848
00:25:46,690 --> 00:25:47,650
No way

849
00:25:48,370 --> 00:25:49,490
I was surprised

850
00:25:50,110 --> 00:25:51,300
He did something amazing

851
00:25:52,200 --> 00:25:55,410
They have been on the bus for 15 minutes

852
00:25:56,080 --> 00:25:57,410
Somehow, this is starting off amazingly

853
00:25:57,420 --> 00:25:58,950
Somehow, this is starting off amazingly

854
00:25:58,950 --> 00:26:00,810
Somehow, this is starting off amazingly

855
00:25:59,750 --> 00:26:00,130
Right?

856
00:26:00,820 --> 00:26:03,350
I'm beat already

857
00:26:01,810 --> 00:26:02,480
Me too

858
00:26:03,520 --> 00:26:08,360
Already these 5 can't conceal their exhaustion

859
00:26:08,550 --> 00:26:15,060
The deluge of laughter assassins

860
00:26:08,550 --> 00:26:15,060
will never relent

861
00:26:15,770 --> 00:26:17,600
I'm so jealous of Hosei

862
00:26:17,650 --> 00:26:18,310
What?

863
00:26:18,510 --> 00:26:22,400
You look like you could fall asleep anywhere

864
00:26:20,240 --> 00:26:22,400
I slept

865
00:26:22,460 --> 00:26:23,810
But I only got about 6 hours...

866
00:26:23,780 --> 00:26:26,940
Arrival at the bus station

867
00:26:23,980 --> 00:26:26,940
Arrival at the bus station

868
00:26:24,080 --> 00:26:26,940
Arrival atthe busstation

869
00:26:24,180 --> 00:26:26,940
Arrival at the bus station

870
00:26:24,520 --> 00:26:25,740
Arrival at the bus station

871
00:26:32,990 --> 00:26:34,710
Help me!

872
00:26:36,540 --> 00:26:40,620
Detective

873
00:26:36,540 --> 00:26:40,620
Hostage

874
00:26:36,540 --> 00:26:40,620
Matsuo Shun

875
00:26:36,540 --> 00:26:40,620
Osada Shouhei

876
00:26:36,540 --> 00:26:40,620
T/N: The detective and hostage are actually comedians of the duo, Chocolate Planet.

877
00:26:37,200 --> 00:26:38,180
I'll shoot, asshole!

878
00:26:38,230 --> 00:26:38,740
Hey! Stop!

879
00:26:39,200 --> 00:26:40,550
We have you surrounded

880
00:26:40,630 --> 00:26:48,630
A masked man took a hostage
and hijacked the bus

881
00:26:41,120 --> 00:26:42,080
Give yourself up quietly!

882
00:26:42,860 --> 00:26:46,810
We already know who you are, and we're taking you in!

883
00:26:47,160 --> 00:26:48,420
You know it all, big guy?

884
00:26:49,020 --> 00:26:49,890
If you already know

885
00:26:50,310 --> 00:26:50,880
Then I won't

886
00:26:51,420 --> 00:26:52,140
Need this

887
00:26:53,920 --> 00:26:56,660
Kamiki Ryunosuke

888
00:26:53,920 --> 00:26:56,660
Masked Man

889
00:26:55,480 --> 00:26:56,100
Calm down!

890
00:26:57,870 --> 00:26:59,500
I'll freaking shoot him

891
00:26:59,510 --> 00:27:00,330
Calm down! Stop that right now!

892
00:27:00,330 --> 00:27:01,970
Calm down! Stop that right now!

893
00:27:01,970 --> 00:27:03,240
Put your hands up

894
00:27:02,780 --> 00:27:03,240
Okay

895
00:27:03,290 --> 00:27:03,920
Put your hands up

896
00:27:03,590 --> 00:27:05,440
Calm down!

897
00:27:04,280 --> 00:27:04,830
Put your hands up

898
00:27:05,540 --> 00:27:06,120
Put your hands up!

899
00:27:06,000 --> 00:27:07,530
I get it- I GET IT!

900
00:27:06,550 --> 00:27:07,110
Put your hands up!

901
00:27:07,760 --> 00:27:08,490
Put your hands up!

902
00:27:08,140 --> 00:27:08,960
I'm putting them up!

903
00:27:09,300 --> 00:27:09,890
Put your hands up!

904
00:27:09,590 --> 00:27:11,200
Okay, look, I'm raising them

905
00:27:10,980 --> 00:27:11,650
Putyourhandsup!

906
00:27:11,670 --> 00:27:12,030
Good?

907
00:27:12,060 --> 00:27:12,440
Put your hands up!

908
00:27:12,460 --> 00:27:12,930
Is this okay?

909
00:27:12,950 --> 00:27:13,560
Put them up!

910
00:27:13,580 --> 00:27:14,060
They're up!

911
00:27:14,070 --> 00:27:14,640
PUT 'EM UP!!

912
00:27:14,700 --> 00:27:15,260

00:32:36,130 --> 00:32:37,390
I already did

1099
00:32:38,110 --> 00:32:40,710
Arrest me! Take me away!

1100
00:32:38,710 --> 00:32:41,680
You're under arrest and I'm taking you in!

1101
00:32:41,910 --> 00:32:45,450
We should have left after the impressions!!

1102
00:32:45,710 --> 00:32:48,240
That was rough

1103
00:32:48,810 --> 00:32:50,120
That was so troublesome

1104
00:32:50,120 --> 00:32:51,560
Right? So troublesome

1105
00:32:53,530 --> 00:32:58,120
What was that "licky licky" thing...

1106
00:32:57,720 --> 00:32:59,150
He's been doing that for a long time

1107
00:32:59,730 --> 00:33:02,930
That pisses me off

1108
00:33:04,120 --> 00:33:06,140
The bus drives onward to high school

1109
00:33:07,670 --> 00:33:10,640
The biggest ever surprise of the series

1110
00:33:10,990 --> 00:33:12,890
With that forbidden joke being unveiled

1111
00:33:12,890 --> 00:33:14,640
IT AIN'T ABOUT YOU

1112
00:33:14,640 --> 00:33:16,640
This is almost crossing the line!

1113
00:33:18,700 --> 00:33:19,900
It's that one right?

1114
00:33:20,620 --> 00:33:22,790
The bus holding the five members...

1115
00:33:22,790 --> 00:33:25,360
...has finally appeared at the school

1116
00:33:25,360 --> 00:33:25,810
However...

1117
00:33:25,810 --> 00:33:34,950
This isn't their goal, but a new battlefield

1118
00:33:31,750 --> 00:33:33,650
Wow it's really Omamegaoka High School

1119
00:33:33,650 --> 00:33:34,680
Wow

1120
00:33:36,320 --> 00:33:38,740
The stage for the No Laughing Batsu Game,

1121
00:33:36,320 --> 00:33:42,660
Heipo Omamegaoka High School

1122
00:33:38,740 --> 00:33:41,610
Heipo Omamegaoka High School

1123
00:33:42,910 --> 00:33:53,220
This school of literary, martial, and comedic arts

1124
00:33:42,910 --> 00:33:53,220
is where the epic battle with the Assassins of Laughter will begin

1125
00:33:53,400 --> 00:33:57,240
Arrival at the school

1126
00:33:53,470 --> 00:33:57,240
Arrival at the school

1127
00:33:53,550 --> 00:33:57,240
Arrival atthe school

1128
00:33:53,620 --> 00:33:57,240
Arrival at the school

1129
00:33:54,170 --> 00:33:55,290
Arrival at the school

1130
00:33:55,490 --> 00:33:57,300
We're here guys, let's go

1131
00:33:56,470 --> 00:33:57,300
We're here

1132
00:33:57,970 --> 00:33:58,520
Get off

1133
00:34:00,340 --> 00:34:01,530
We've arrived

1134
00:34:01,530 --> 00:34:02,030
Here we go

1135
00:34:02,030 --> 00:34:03,080
It's through here

1136
00:34:05,980 --> 00:34:07,880
It's a pretty splendid school right?

1137
00:34:08,830 --> 00:34:10,000
Yeah it is

1138
00:34:10,720 --> 00:34:13,690
The grounds are spacious too, quite nice

1139
00:34:14,390 --> 00:34:16,960
It's the first principal, Mr. Heipo

1140
00:34:17,730 --> 00:34:22,030
First Principal

1141
00:34:17,730 --> 00:34:22,030
Mr. Heipo

1142
00:34:19,010 --> 00:34:22,030
He's one of the candidates for the

1143
00:34:19,010 --> 00:34:22,030
T/N: Ten thousand yen in USD is roughly $91.51.

1144
00:34:19,010 --> 00:34:22,030
next ten thousand yen bills

1145
00:34:22,530 --> 00:34:25,600
For the next ten thousand yen bill . . .

1146
00:34:24,000 --> 00:34:25,600
It's already been decided though

1147
00:34:25,920 --> 00:34:31,510
School's Main Entrance

1148
00:34:26,620 --> 00:34:28,940
The one after that

1149
00:34:27,600 --> 00:34:30,390
Might be better to say that when the topic of the next ten thousand yen bill comes up

1150
00:34:33,440 --> 00:34:35,140
So this means we're going to...

1151
00:34:35,140 --> 00:34:36,610
A classroom, maybe?

1152
00:34:36,610 --> 00:34:38,300
Right, it's got to be a classroom

1153
00:34:38,300 --> 00:34:39,600
Last time...

1154
00:34:40,080 --> 00:34:41,430
Yes it's a first

1155
00:34:41,920 --> 00:34:43,320
We're Class 3-B apparently

1156
00:34:43,320 --> 00:34:44,070
Here...

1157
00:34:44,070 --> 00:34:44,840
Oh yeah you're right

1158
00:34:44,840 --> 00:34:47,040
This is the new students' classroom

1159
00:34:48,220 --> 00:34:49,790
Take the seat with your name on it

1160
00:34:50,040 --> 00:34:50,890
Wow

1161
00:34:50,890 --> 00:34:52,560
Oh it's like this now

1162
00:34:52,910 --> 00:34:53,830
Oh right...

1163
00:34:52,910 --> 00:34:59,050
3-B Classroom

1164
00:34:53,830 --> 00:34:56,380
Usually, it's tables stuck together in 1 big group

1165
00:34:56,930 --> 00:34:57,800
It was like

1166
00:34:57,800 --> 00:34:58,870
Ah but it's a bit...

1167
00:34:59,320 --> 00:35:01,340
It's different than usual, the placements

1168
00:35:01,340 --> 00:35:03,370
It's not the same

1169
00:35:03,070 --> 00:35:04,270
Take your seats

1170
00:35:06,140 --> 00:35:09,730
The place where the five members will live as students, 3rd Year Class B

1171
00:35:09,930 --> 00:35:16,370
Of course the classroom also has many traps to make them laugh

1172
00:35:16,620 --> 00:35:21,220
However, the members still have no clue as to what they are

1173
00:35:24,630 --> 00:35:26,760
It feels kind of weird

1174
00:35:26,760 --> 00:35:29,350
We'll be watching the backside of Cocorico

1175
00:35:29,350 --> 00:35:31,030
We'll be watching the backside of Cocorico

1176
00:35:31,030 --> 00:35:34,100
The seats are quite differently positioned than usual

1177
00:35:35,240 --> 00:35:38,170
Is watching Cocorico from the back something to care about?

1178
00:35:38,170 --> 00:35:39,610
Is watching Cocorico from the back something to care about?

1179
00:35:39,610 --> 00:35:42,430
The way we're seated is what's really weird

1180
00:35:42,430 --> 00:35:43,980
This seating is weird therefore we have to watch their back...

1181
00:35:43,980 --> 00:35:46,350
This seating is weird therefore we have to watch their back...

1182
00:35:46,700 --> 00:35:48,320
The way making us look at it...

1183
00:35:50,870 --> 00:35:53,840
That's right, he was definitely laughing

1184
00:35:52,450 --> 00:35:54,320
What happened right now was weird

1185
00:35:54,320 --> 00:35:55,760
Since you're cheerful usually

1186
00:35:57,760 --> 00:36:00,830
This is the "No Laughing Batsu" man, you were pretty loose right now

1187
00:36:00,830 --> 00:36:04,100
This is the "No Laughing Batsu" man, you were pretty loose right now

1188
00:36:04,920 --> 00:36:11,340
One hour since the start

1189
00:36:04,920 --> 00:36:11,340
They've reached the classroom at last and have settled down

1190
00:36:11,690 --> 00:36:18,550
Leaving no time to rest

1191
00:36:11,690 --> 00:36:18,550
The big name Assassins of Laughter will be on the offense

1192
00:36:21,770 --> 00:36:22,670
You guys okay?

1193
00:36:23,850 --> 00:36:24,590
You guys haven't given the superintendent your greetings

1194
00:36:24,590 --> 00:36:27,960
You guys haven't given the superintendent your greetings

1195
00:36:27,970 --> 00:36:29,110
We're going to greetong...

1196
00:36:29,110 --> 00:36:31,360
I'll guide you so let's go

1197
00:36:31,360 --> 00:36:33,360
Greet the superintendent come on

1198
00:36:33,730 --> 00:36:41,140
Heipo Omamegaoka High School New Students' Customary Greeting of the Superintendent

1199
00:36:34,160 --> 00:36:35,750
We have to greet the superintendent?

1200
00:36:36,250 --> 00:36:37,430
Not the principal?

1201
00:36:37,430 --> 00:36:37,950
Right?

1202
00:36:37,950 --> 00:36:38,570
Superintendent?

1203
00:36:38,900 --> 00:36:40,320
Is this a thing?

1204
00:36:41,370 --> 00:36:43,490
Is it a coincidence?

1205
00:36:43,490 --> 00:36:44,470
Oh them being here?

1206
00:36:44,470 --> 00:36:47,710
Students meeting the superintendent is quite rare

1207
00:36:48,230 --> 00:36:48,860
You're right

1208
00:36:51,380 --> 00:36:52,080
It's through here

1209
00:36:52,080 --> 00:36:52,580
It's for real, Superintendent's Room it says

1210
00:36:52,580 --> 00:36:55,350
It's for real, Superintendent's Room it says

1211
00:36:53,930 --> 00:36:55,350
It's true

1212
00:36:55,970 --> 00:36:57,070
Let's go in

1213
00:36:57,600 --> 00:36:58,690
Excuse us

1214
00:36:59,720 --> 00:37:00,440
It's here

1215
00:37:01,540 --> 00:37:06,760
Superintendent's Room

1216
00:37:02,860 --> 00:37:03,910
It's very fancy

1217
00:37:04,260 --> 00:37:06,760
This school's superintendent

1218
00:37:06,760 --> 00:37:08,730
used to be a teacher, and for their work as an educator, is very respected by everyone

1219
00:37:08,730 --> 00:37:10,400

used to be a teacher, and for their work as an educator, is very respected by everyone

1221
00:37:13,420 --> 00:37:15,690

1222
00:37:15,690 --> 00:37:18,110
All of the teachers, student's guardians, etc. they really truly respect them

1223
00:37:19,160 --> 00:37:22,530
They're a great teacher you guys

1224
00:37:20,970 --> 00:37:22,530
Teacher?

1225
00:37:22,340 --> 00:37:23,430
A great superintendent

1226
00:37:25,880 --> 00:37:27,230
That's just...

1227
00:37:27,230 --> 00:37:27,900
What the hell is that explanation?

1228
00:37:27,900 --> 00:37:29,570
Really

1229
00:37:30,120 --> 00:37:32,140
You said superintendent so many times just now

1230
00:37:36,010 --> 00:37:38,430
They're an extremely strict person so don't do anything disrespectful okay?

1231
00:37:38,430 --> 00:37:39,830
They're an extremely strict person so don't do anything disrespectful okay?

1232
00:38:10,160 --> 00:38:11,610
It's very suprising isn't it?

1233
00:38:11,610 --> 00:38:13,280
It is, isn't it?

1234
00:38:16,650 --> 00:38:26,010
Akutsu Maya (Amami Yuki)

1235
00:38:16,650 --> 00:38:26,010

Okay

1242
00:38:33,850 --> 00:38:37,920
Eeh, I'm Tsukite-

1243
00:38:34,520 --> 00:38:37,920
That won't be necessary

1244
00:38:42,940 --> 00:38:44,710
You know you can't laugh, but...

1245
00:38:45,530 --> 00:38:48,000
That was so blunt. . .

1246
00:38:47,130 --> 00:38:48,630
That's so scary!

1247
00:38:52,750 --> 00:38:53,970
She's so scary...

1248
00:38:53,970 --> 00:38:56,040
It's not necessary, it's a waste of time

1249
00:38:56,040 --> 00:38:58,370
It's not necessary, it's a waste of time

1250
00:38:58,740 --> 00:39:02,680
Life is a stacked pile of seconds

1251
00:39:02,680 --> 00:39:04,580
One who wastes time is one who wastes their life

1252
00:39:04,580 --> 00:39:06,800
One who wastes time is one who wastes their life

1253

00:40:02,120 --> 00:40:03,890
5,000 is pretty low...

1273
00:40:03,140 --> 00:40:06,610
I want her to use the good data as well

1274
00:40:05,390 --> 00:40:06,610
Yes I agree

1275
00:40:07,040 --> 00:40:07,840
Endo Shozo, Tanaka Naoki

1276
00:40:07,840 --> 00:40:09,530
Endo Shozo, Tanaka Naoki

1277
00:40:08,790 --> 00:40:09,530
Yes

1278
00:40:09,530 --> 00:40:11,580
In 1992, you debuted with the name Cocorico Bombers as comedians

1279
00:40:11,580 --> 00:40:13,300
In 1992, you debuted with the name Cocorico Bombers as comedians

1280
00:40:14,750 --> 00:40:17,620
Endo, in October of 2018

1281
00:40:17,620 --> 00:40:19,340
Bought a 5 bedroom house with a balcony in Setagaya

1282
00:40:19,340 --> 00:40:22,890
Bought a 5 bedroom house with a balcony in Setagaya

1283
00:40:19,340 --> 00:40:22,890
T/N: Setagaya is a very posh neighborhood in Tokyo.

1284
00:40:23,460 --> 00:40:25,160
T/N: 1 million yen to USD is roughly $9,151.

1285
00:40:23,460 --> 00:40:25,160
Using 1 million yen to build a golf green for your yard

1286
00:40:25,160 --> 00:40:28,950
Using 1 million yen to build a golf green for your yard

1287
00:40:29,850 --> 00:40:30,600
It's pretty small though

1288
00:40:31,400 --> 00:40:32,820
Tanaka's car is a 26 year old second hand Volvo

1289
00:40:32,820 --> 00:40:33,920
Tanaka's car is a 26 year old second hand Volvo

1290

Tanaka's car is a 26 year old second hand Volvo

1291
00:40:40,490 --> 00:40:41,430
That's it

1292
00:40:41,640 --> 00:40:44,130
That's it for us?

1293
00:40:44,130 --> 00:40:45,750
Volvo is...

1294
00:40:46,200 --> 00:40:47,480
I like Volvos

1295
00:40:47,480 --> 00:40:48,770
She has no information

1296
00:40:52,470 --> 00:40:53,740
That was very little info

1297
00:40:54,590 --> 00:40:55,460
Hamada Masatoshi, Matsumoto Hitoshi

1298
00:40:55,460 --> 00:40:57,260
Hamada Masatoshi, Matsumoto Hitoshi

1299
00:40:57,720 --> 00:40:59,860
In 1982, you made your debut with the name Light Bros. as comedians

1300
00:40:59,860 --> 00:41:03,150
In 1982, you made your debut with the name Light Bros. as comedians

1301
00:41:04,050 --> 00:41:07,200
Hamada's first girlfriend is

1302
00:41:07,990 --> 00:41:10,020
The girl with flowing hair, ABC-ko

1303
00:41:10,020 --> 00:41:13,710
The girl with flowing hair, ABC-ko

1304
00:41:15,260 --> 00:41:17,210
How the hell?!?

1305
00:41:17,210 --> 00:41:19,880
From middle school?

1306
00:41:17,210 --> 00:41:19,880
It's from middle school

1307
00:41:21,650 --> 00:41:23,720
That's very scary

1308
00:41:26,340 --> 00:41:28,990
Wasn't there better data?

1309
00:41:27,620 --> 00:41:28,990
Right?

1310
00:41:29,710 --> 00:41:32,780
Matsumoto's first girlfriend, during 3rd year of middle school, was...

1311
00:41:32,780 --> 00:41:35,730
Matsumoto's first girlfriend, during 3rd year of middle school, was...

1312
00:41:36,200 --> 00:41:39,500
XYZ-ko

1313
00:41:42,670 --> 00:41:45,370
We don't know who that is

1314
00:41:45,390 --> 00:41:46,960
You don't

1315
00:41:46,060 --> 00:41:46,960
Right?

1316
00:41:46,960 --> 00:41:47,510
Yes yes, that's right

1317
00:41:47,510 --> 00:41:48,580
Yes yes, that's right

1318
00:41:50,880 --> 00:41:52,130
Wah that hurts

1319
00:41:53,380 --> 00:41:55,320
Matsumoto at the time

1320
00:41:55,320 --> 00:41:58,050
Wada Shunichi and yourself would often go on double dates

1321
00:41:58,050 --> 00:42:01,320
Wada Shunichi and yourself would often go on double dates

1322
00:41:58,790 --> 00:42:00,620
She knew so much

1323
00:42:00,990 --> 00:42:02,210
Isn't it amazing?

1324
00:42:04,540 --> 00:42:06,210
Yes that's in fact true, but...

1325
00:42:06,210 --> 00:42:07,630
...You say it all so easily

1326
00:42:07,860 --> 00:42:09,730
She really didn't hesitate

1327
00:42:11,450 --> 00:42:12,930
It's correct, but...

1328
00:42:13,500 --> 00:42:16,070
Matsumoto

1329
00:42:16,070 --> 00:42:17,940
Even if you wear a suit or a jersey

1330
00:42:17,940 --> 00:42:19,740
Even if you wear a suit or a jersey

1331
00:42:19,740 --> 00:42:22,280
You always wear Crocs on your feet is that correct?

1332
00:42:22,280 --> 00:42:25,950
Those Crocs, where do you buy them?

1333
00:42:28,620 --> 00:42:30,050
Your Crocs, do you have different ones for summer and winter?

1334
00:42:30,050 --> 00:42:32,140
Your Crocs, do you have different ones for summer and winter?

1335
00:42:32,140 --> 00:42:34,120
Your Crocs, do you have different ones for summer and winter?

1336
00:42:34,120 --> 00:42:35,960
Yes I do, some have holes in them and others don't

1337
00:42:35,960 --> 00:42:37,860
Yes I do, some have holes in them and others don't

1338
00:42:38,330 --> 00:42:41,430
What is going on?

1339
00:42:46,400 --> 00:42:48,790
That's my Crocs, what the hell

1340
00:42:51,910 --> 00:42:53,140
What are you doing with them?

1341
00:42:54,060 --> 00:42:56,210
I wore them this morning,

1342
00:42:56,210 --> 00:42:57,830
I was wearing them in the morning

1343
00:42:57,830 --> 00:42:59,830
Superintendent? Superintendent?

1344
00:43:02,520 --> 00:43:03,720
That hurts so bad

1345
00:43:06,090 --> 00:43:07,650
Matsumoto

1346
00:43:06,790 --> 00:43:07,650
Yes

1347
00:43:07,650 --> 00:43:10,760
Throw these Crocs

1348
00:43:10,760 --> 00:43:14,030
Hurry up and throw it

1349
00:43:14,030 --> 00:43:16,400
Throw it?

1350
00:43:14,930 --> 00:43:16,400
Throw it

1351
00:43:26,640 --> 00:43:28,360
Hamada, pick up the Crocs

1352
00:43:28,360 --> 00:43:30,910
Hamada, pick up the Crocs

1353
00:43:43,110 --> 00:43:44,930
I picked it up

1354
00:43:44,930 --> 00:43:47,360
Throw the Crocs

1355
00:43:47,360 --> 00:43:48,960
Throw it

1356
00:43:56,840 --> 00:43:58,440
Matsumoto

1357
00:43:57,720 --> 00:43:58,440
Yes

1358
00:43:59,070 --> 00:44:01,940
Do you understand what I'm having you do?

1359
00:44:01,940 --> 00:44:04,330
I have no idea

1360
00:44:04,330 --> 00:44:06,400
Crocs are designed to be bottom heavy

1361
00:44:06,400 --> 00:44:09,050
Crocs are designed to be bottom heavy

1362
00:44:10,220 --> 00:44:13,120
So naturally the sole wants to point down

1363
00:44:13,120 --> 00:44:15,320
and they always land the right way up

1364
00:44:17,260 --> 00:44:20,360
People like Matsumoto who have lost all sense of

1365
00:44:20,410 --> 00:44:23,850
curiosity and wonder about the things they love,

1366
00:44:22,750 --> 00:44:23,850
they aren't people

1367
00:44:23,850 --> 00:44:27,300
They're worth even less than monkeys

1368
00:44:28,340 --> 00:44:34,040
The moment we lose our curiosity,

1369
00:44:30,990 --> 00:44:34,040
humanity humanity is as good as dead

1370
00:44:32,810 --> 00:44:34,040
humanity is as good as dead

1371
00:44:34,040 --> 00:44:35,980
Matsumoto

1372
00:44:36,930 --> 00:44:39,350
Get a grip and wake up already

1373
00:44:47,750 --> 00:44:49,410
Ahhh, please...

1374
00:44:54,790 --> 00:44:56,100
You're looking pretty relaxed there, Endo

1375
00:44:56,100 --> 00:44:59,130
You're looking pretty relaxed there, Endo

1376
00:44:57,280 --> 00:44:58,450
Yes?

1377
00:44:59,150 --> 00:45:00,100
You have this thing where you put on a silly voice, slap your cheeks,

1378
00:45:00,100 --> 00:45:01,270
You have this thing where you put on a silly voice, slap your cheeks,

1379
00:45:01,270 --> 00:45:05,970
You have this thing where you put on a silly voice, slap your cheeks,

1380
00:45:02,790 --> 00:45:04,190
get naked, and do a little dance, right?

1381
00:45:04,190 --> 00:45:05,970
get naked, and do a little dance, right?

1382
00:45:07,010 --> 00:45:10,810
Do that here, right now

1383
00:45:11,140 --> 00:45:12,810
Hurry up, get naked. Do it.

1384
00:45:12,810 --> 00:45:14,380
Hurry up, get naked. Do it.

1385
00:45:13,650 --> 00:45:15,550
Right now?

1386
00:45:14,380 --> 00:45:15,550
Right now

1387
00:45:16,520 --> 00:45:18,940
Hurry hurry

1388
00:45:19,090 --> 00:45:21,420
You're wasting our time

1389
00:45:19,890 --> 00:45:21,420
Yes, sorry

1390
00:45:22,920 --> 00:45:24,360
She knows?

1391
00:45:24,930 --> 00:45:25,560
Does she know of this?

1392
00:45:25,560 --> 00:45:26,730
I guess so

1393
00:45:26,730 --> 00:45:28,180
Please let's hurry

1394
00:45:32,770 --> 00:45:33,970
Okay, here I go

1395
00:45:33,970 --> 00:45:35,840
Okay, here I go

1396
00:45:38,690 --> 00:45:40,360
She's laughing!!

1397
00:45:46,580 --> 00:45:48,180
She clearly laughed!

1398
00:45:47,700 --> 00:45:49,050
She laughed

1399
00:45:55,270 --> 00:45:56,490
Here I go

1400
00:46:00,630 --> 00:46:04,000
Do you know the rhythm of the samba?

1401
00:46:04,000 --> 00:46:06,970
Let's get excited for the new year, everyone!

1402
00:46:06,970 --> 00:46:11,040
HO HO HOI! HO HO HOI! Ba-dum bum!

1403
00:46:11,040 --> 00:46:13,260
HO HO HOI! HO HO HOI! Ba-dum bum!

1404
00:46:13,260 --> 00:46:15,710
HO HO HOI! HO HO HOI! Ba-dum bum!

1405
00:46:15,710 --> 00:46:17,510
That's enough

1406
00:46:19,110 --> 00:46:19,450
Exactly what is funny about that?

1407
00:46:19,450 --> 00:46:23,450
Exactly what is funny about that?

1408
00:46:33,210 --> 00:46:35,000
It is hard to get

1409
00:46:34,180 --> 00:46:36,050
Right! I don't know
what makes it funny

1410
00:46:36,060 --> 00:46:37,750
Do it as Mori Shinichi

1411
00:46:36,060 --> 00:46:42,870
T/N: Mori Shinichi is a famous traditional Japanese singer that Endo often does impressions of.

1412
00:46:39,330 --> 00:46:42,870
Do "Ho ho hoi" as Mori Shinichi

1413
00:46:42,540 --> 00:46:44,240
The demands are intense

1414
00:46:50,310 --> 00:46:52,400
She's laughing!

1415
00:46:52,060 --> 00:46:55,780
Do you know the rhythm of the Samba

1416
00:46:52,400 --> 00:46:53,800
She's really laughing!

1417
00:46:55,780 --> 00:46:59,620
Let's get excited, everyone

1418
00:46:59,620 --> 00:47:01,420
That's enough

1419
00:47:05,780 --> 00:47:07,660
Endo did a good job

1420
00:47:06,630 --> 00:47:07,660
Yes, can't blame Endo

1421
00:47:10,800 --> 00:47:12,570
Even she was laughing!

1422
00:47:13,870 --> 00:47:15,800
I have this slight memory, Hosei

1423
00:47:15,800 --> 00:47:17,170
I have this slight memory, Hosei

1424
00:47:16,690 --> 00:47:17,170
Yes

1425
00:47:17,870 --> 00:47:19,070
You also had this gag where you did a silly voice, comical pose,

1426
00:47:19,070 --> 00:47:21,110
You also had this gag where you did a silly voice, comical pose,

1427
00:47:21,110 --> 00:47:25,710
You also had this gag where you did a silly voice, comical pose,

1428
00:47:23,210 --> 00:47:25,710
and said, "Maaa", correct?

1429
00:47:26,700 --> 00:47:27,750
So she knows about this

1430
00:47:28,820 --> 00:47:30,470
She really knows about this

1431
00:47:30,470 --> 00:47:31,950
Would you go that far?

1432
00:47:33,070 --> 00:47:33,940
How does she know?

1433
00:47:36,990 --> 00:47:40,930
Try doing the "Maaa" gag

1434
00:47:39,030 --> 00:47:40,930
right here, right now

1435
00:47:40,680 --> 00:47:42,060
That's mean

1436
00:47:42,060 --> 00:47:43,150
This is new to me

1437
00:47:43,050 --> 00:47:44,710
MAAAAAA!!

1438
00:47:45,430 --> 00:47:46,920
Again

1439
00:47:47,500 --> 00:47:49,220
MAAAAAA!!

1440
00:47:53,540 --> 00:47:54,970
Endo, you do the "Maaa"

1441
00:47:54,970 --> 00:47:57,680
Endo, you do the "Maaa"

1442
00:47:57,680 --> 00:48:00,800
Me?

1443
00:47:57,990 --> 00:47:59,500
This is absurd

1444
00:48:00,200 --> 00:48:01,820
Totally absurd

1445
00:48:02,220 --> 00:48:04,420
MAAAAAA!!

1446
00:48:06,440 --> 00:48:07,620
Hosei

1447
00:48:07,170 --> 00:48:07,620
Yes

1448
00:48:07,620 --> 00:48:09,960
Do "Ho ho hoi"

1449
00:48:11,010 --> 00:48:12,790
Totally nonsensical

1450
00:48:12,790 --> 00:48:17,100
Do you know the rhythm of the Samba

1451
00:48:17,100 --> 00:48:18,000
Ho ho hoi!

1452
00:48:18,000 --> 00:48:20,000
Make the world smile an-

1453
00:48:19,470 --> 00:48:20,920
That's enough

1454
00:48:22,600 --> 00:48:26,470
Because this is such a rare opportunity

1455
00:48:23,970 --> 00:48:26,470
please do it while facing each other

1456
00:48:26,470 --> 00:48:29,110
Do it while looking into each other's eyes

1457
00:48:27,860 --> 00:48:29,030
Incredible

1458
00:48:28,830 --> 00:48:30,060
It really is incredible

1459
00:48:31,360 --> 00:48:35,980
Do you know the rhythm of the Samba

1460
00:48:31,860 --> 00:48:32,800
MAAAAAA!!

1461
00:48:33,580 --> 00:48:35,010
MAAAAAA!!

1462
00:48:35,380 --> 00:48:36,720
MAAAAAA!!

1463
00:48:35,970 --> 00:48:37,470
Everyone is having fun

1464
00:48:37,470 --> 00:48:39,550
Ho ho hoi!

1465
00:48:39,550 --> 00:48:44,010
Ba-dum bam, ho ho hoi!

1466
00:48:44,010 --> 00:48:47,030
Ba-dum bam

1467
00:48:47,030 --> 00:48:50,030
Ho-ho hoi

1468
00:48:49,100 --> 00:48:51,100
This is ridiculous!

1469
00:48:55,470 --> 00:48:56,890
This is hell...

1470
00:48:56,790 --> 00:49:01,060
Because this is such a precious moment,

1471
00:48:59,070 --> 00:49:01,060
both of you, try doing it as Shinichi Mori

1472
00:49:02,580 --> 00:49:05,310
This is incredible

1473
00:49:06,650 --> 00:49:08,150
She still won't let them off

1474
00:49:11,320 --> 00:49:15,120
Do you know the rhythm of the Samba

1475
00:49:17,290 --> 00:49:18,830
Stop

1476
00:49:19,160 --> 00:49:20,330
She's quick to stop it

1477
00:49:20,530 --> 00:49:21,430
"Stop"

1478
00:49:24,030 --> 00:49:26,250
Incredible...

1479
00:49:28,270 --> 00:49:28,990
It hurts

1480
00:49:29,590 --> 00:49:30,440
I can't

1481
00:49:30,440 --> 00:49:31,810
Of all the superintendents till now, this is by far the worst

1482
00:49:31,810 --> 00:49:33,110
Of all the superintendents till now, this is by far the worst

1483
00:49:34,160 --> 00:49:36,480
Okay, everyone try doing "Maaa"

1484
00:49:36,480 --> 00:49:39,780
Okay, everyone try doing "Maaa"

1485
00:49:40,650 --> 00:49:41,450
Whatever "Maaa" is

1486
00:49:41,450 --> 00:49:42,550
Right! Haha

1487
00:49:44,070 --> 00:49:45,340
What the hell is "Maaa"

1488
00:49:45,920 --> 00:49:47,440
Ready, set

1489
00:49:48,040 --> 00:49:50,160
MAAAAAA!!!

1490
00:49:50,160 --> 00:49:51,660
Louder

1491
00:49:52,480 --> 00:49:54,530
MAAAAAA!!!

1492
00:49:54,530 --> 00:49:56,030
Now as Shinichi Mori

1493
00:49:56,430 --> 00:49:58,620
Maaaaaa!

1494
00:50:01,170 --> 00:50:02,890
Is this even real...?

1495
00:50:05,840 --> 00:50:08,140
Really all over the place

1496
00:50:13,080 --> 00:50:16,220
All of you

1497
00:50:16,230 --> 00:50:18,350
Get a grip and wake up already

1498
00:50:21,820 --> 00:50:23,810
Now leave

1499
00:50:23,810 --> 00:50:25,180
We couldn't get her...

1500
00:50:25,930 --> 00:50:27,630
Hosei

1501
00:50:27,630 --> 00:50:29,500
GSX (Gasupeke)

1502
00:50:35,100 --> 00:50:35,820
What the...?

1503
00:50:36,270 --> 00:50:37,970
What sort of last word is that?

1504
00:50:40,710 --> 00:50:42,740
We were completely worn out

1505
00:50:45,410 --> 00:50:49,020
We were worn down harder than I thought we would be

1506
00:50:47,330 --> 00:50:49,020
Yes, indeed

1507
00:50:49,720 --> 00:50:52,350
One and a half hours since they started their school life

1508
00:50:50,470 --> 00:50:54,850
1 hour and 30 minutes

1509
00:50:50,470 --> 00:50:54,850
School life

1510
00:50:52,890 --> 00:50:56,610
It's about time to start a certain long battle

1511
00:50:58,660 --> 00:51:01,060
That must be instead of the drawers, right

1512
00:51:01,060 --> 00:51:04,450
Yeah, this has be this time's drawers

1513
00:51:04,450 --> 00:51:09,700
The annual drawer tradition

1514
00:51:05,320 --> 00:51:06,100
Shall I start?

1515
00:51:06,100 --> 00:51:06,770
Pull it out

1516
00:51:07,000 --> 00:51:07,770
Is it okay?

1517
00:51:07,520 --> 00:51:08,870
Aaaah, naah

1518
00:51:08,970 --> 00:51:12,270
No, but we have to do it

1519
00:51:09,920 --> 00:51:11,820
We should just get it over with

1520
00:51:12,710 --> 00:51:16,280
Tanaka is going first

1521
00:51:13,790 --> 00:51:14,660
Really

1522
00:51:15,460 --> 00:51:16,760
Doing it this way... Ah, it's tight

1523
00:51:17,460 --> 00:51:19,650
There's something in there

1524
00:51:20,350 --> 00:51:22,950
It's really packed in there

1525
00:51:21,880 --> 00:51:22,580
A letter?

1526
00:51:23,670 --> 00:51:30,410
A letter and something black

1527
00:51:23,970 --> 00:51:24,700
What IS that?

1528
00:51:26,070 --> 00:51:27,490
A letter and... What is this?

1529
00:51:28,740 --> 00:51:30,160
I should do it right away, right

1530
00:51:30,460 --> 00:51:33,140
Yeah, you've already taken it out so

1531
00:51:31,290 --> 00:51:31,810
Yeah

1532
00:51:32,710 --> 00:51:34,080
I should just check what it is

1533
00:51:34,280 --> 00:51:37,000
What the hell is that?

1534
00:51:35,410 --> 00:51:35,810
Yeah

1535
00:51:37,000 --> 00:51:54,680

1536
00:51:37,130 --> 00:51:39,980
Unbeatable baggy pants. Wear this and if you laugh, the Batsu army

1537
00:51:37,130 --> 00:51:44,040
T/N: These baggy pants are called "bontan" in Japanese. They're often associated with delinquents.

1538
00:51:39,250 --> 00:51:40,400
Unbeatable baggy pants..?

1539
00:51:39,980 --> 00:51:41,950
Unbeatable baggy pants. Wear this  and if you laugh, the Batsu army

1540
00:51:41,950 --> 00:51:44,040
Unbeatable baggy pants. Wear this and if you laugh, the Batsu army

1541
00:51:44,040 --> 00:51:54,680
Unbeatable baggy pants. Wear this and if you laugh, the Batsu army

1542
00:51:45,460 --> 00:51:47,190
will cower away in fear. Super baggy pants. No time limit.

1543
00:51:46,760 --> 00:51:48,060
Now that's nice

1544
00:51:47,190 --> 00:51:49,210
will cower away in fear. Super baggy pants. No time limit.

1545
00:51:49,210 --> 00:51:54,680
will cower away in fear. Super baggy pants. No time limit.

1546
00:51:50,430 --> 00:51:52,230
Baggy pants?

1547
00:51:51,810 --> 00:51:52,850
What is that..

1548
00:51:52,850 --> 00:51:53,800
What

1549
00:51:53,150 --> 00:51:54,150
Unbeatable baggy pants!

1550
00:51:54,400 --> 00:51:56,020
What, that is Tanaka's?

1551
00:51:56,020 --> 00:51:57,270
Yeah, this is mine

1552
00:51:56,720 --> 00:51:57,270
Why?

1553
00:51:57,270 --> 00:51:59,090
What? Because I found it in my desk

1554
00:51:59,090 --> 00:52:00,640
So if you laugh they won't come for you?

1555
00:52:00,640 --> 00:52:02,120
So if you laugh they won't come for you?

1556
00:52:02,120 --> 00:52:04,090
Well, because it's the unbeatable baggy pants, I won't get punished

1557
00:52:02,120 --> 00:52:11,200
Unbeatable super item

1558
00:52:04,410 --> 00:52:06,040
They won't come even if I laugh

1559
00:52:06,010 --> 00:52:07,180
Even if you laugh...

1560
00:52:07,430 --> 00:52:08,560
They will cower away in fear

1561
00:52:08,610 --> 00:52:10,730
No time limit!

1562
00:52:09,580 --> 00:52:10,930
Yeah, there's no time limit

1563
00:52:11,400 --> 00:52:12,680
Is it really Tanaka's?

1564
00:52:12,700 --> 00:52:14,520
Of course, it was in my desk!

1565
00:52:14,770 --> 00:52:16,090
Really an incredible pair of baggy pants

1566
00:52:16,270 --> 00:52:18,940
Hurry up with the zipper

1567
00:52:17,470 --> 00:52:18,520
You're fumbling a lot

1568
00:52:19,270 --> 00:52:21,460
J-just try laughing a little

1569
00:52:30,570 --> 00:52:36,420
Tanaka has become unbeatable

1570
00:52:31,300 --> 00:52:32,620
Woah, that is super nice!

1571
00:52:32,770 --> 00:52:34,690
Ah, so that's what "cower in fear" means

1572
00:52:34,470 --> 00:52:35,670
What the hell is this

1573
00:52:36,890 --> 00:52:38,930
He really did cower away in fear

1574
00:52:45,570 --> 00:52:48,600
He makes me so mad

1575
00:52:50,050 --> 00:52:51,240
You did laugh

1576
00:52:54,710 --> 00:52:55,710
Well, yeah

1577
00:52:56,780 --> 00:52:57,780
Our pants

1578
00:52:58,110 --> 00:53:00,750
What is this?

1579
00:52:58,760 --> 00:53:00,450
Our pants are just regular pants

1580
00:53:01,100 --> 00:53:02,780
But it said there was no time limit, right?

1581
00:53:14,160 --> 00:53:17,500
Stop that lame acting

1582
00:53:15,360 --> 00:53:17,500
That's right

1583
00:53:17,500 --> 00:53:18,920
That's right

1584
00:53:21,020 --> 00:53:22,670
You were grinning

1585
00:53:29,010 --> 00:53:31,360
Cut that out. Don't chase him

1586
00:53:33,830 --> 00:53:35,350
Tsk!!

1587
00:53:45,610 --> 00:53:47,060
This is annoying

1588
00:53:47,060 --> 00:53:50,230
This loop is starting to get on my nerves

1589
00:53:50,230 --> 00:53:52,230
Pisses me off

1590
00:53:50,950 --> 00:53:53,330
Annoying

1591
00:53:53,770 --> 00:53:55,900
Tanaka cut it out

1592
00:53:56,770 --> 00:53:58,470
The back of my thighs hurt!

1593
00:53:58,470 --> 00:54:00,440
Thank you very much

1594
00:53:59,510 --> 00:54:03,010
Change your baggy pants

1595
00:54:01,060 --> 00:54:03,980
This has been going on for too long

1596
00:54:02,380 --> 00:54:03,810
Change your pants

1597
00:54:03,810 --> 00:54:06,250
I'm sorry, but this is mine

1598
00:54:06,250 --> 00:54:07,180
This time, we might be getting only nice items for a change...

1599
00:54:07,180 --> 00:54:09,450
This time, we might be getting only nice items for a change...

1600
00:54:09,820 --> 00:54:13,070
Tanaka got this and so on

1601
00:54:13,450 --> 00:54:16,160
For real?

1602
00:54:14,440 --> 00:54:17,490
Well since...

1603
00:54:15,740 --> 00:54:17,490
Matsumoto-san

1604
00:54:17,490 --> 00:54:21,530
The opportunity for something good is there, Matsumoto!!

1605
00:54:18,090 --> 00:54:19,790
You might be lucky

1606
00:54:19,790 --> 00:54:21,530
Would be strange if only he got something good

1607
00:54:21,680 --> 00:54:22,750
That's true

1608
00:54:26,570 --> 00:54:29,750
Key for locker no. 5

1609
00:54:27,220 --> 00:54:29,220
Number 5

1610
00:54:30,590 --> 00:54:32,590
Ah, it's over here

1611
00:54:31,390 --> 00:54:32,590
Over there

1612
00:54:31,970 --> 00:54:35,580
Locker no. 5

1613
00:54:31,970 --> 00:54:35,580
m 0 0 l 150 0 150 150 0 150

1614
00:54:33,710 --> 00:54:35,580
Could be a nice item

1615
00:54:34,960 --> 00:54:38,530
That's right. Could be

1616
00:54:35,580 --> 00:54:40,180
It must be something that can't fit in here

1617
00:54:40,180 --> 00:54:42,350
It might make you invincible

1618
00:54:41,330 --> 00:54:45,280
Invincible... Could be

1619
00:54:42,350 --> 00:54:44,350
From the invincible series

1620
00:54:44,200 --> 00:54:45,280
Do you have the key?

1621
00:54:45,280 --> 00:54:46,220
An invincible school jacket maybe

1622
00:54:46,220 --> 00:54:50,490
An invincible school jacket maybe

1623
00:54:46,870 --> 00:54:47,720
Yes yes

1624
00:54:47,720 --> 00:54:50,490
Because a school jacket wouldn't be able to fit in there

1625
00:54:49,510 --> 00:54:50,490
Yes, yes

1626
00:54:51,160 --> 00:54:54,530
Might be what happens this year

1627
00:54:53,410 --> 00:54:54,530
That's right

1628
00:54:55,230 --> 00:54:56,700
EH!?

1629
00:54:58,730 --> 00:55:00,200
What is this?

1630
00:55:00,200 --> 00:55:06,770
Mysterious white box

1631
00:55:00,620 --> 00:55:01,500
A box

1632
00:55:02,920 --> 00:55:04,690
How scary

1633
00:55:04,690 --> 00:55:06,760
What is that?

1634
00:55:14,700 --> 00:55:16,580

00:56:42,670 --> 00:56:42,690
Do-re-mi on the recorder

1793
00:56:42,670 --> 00:56:42,690
Play the perfect do-re-mi on the recorder

1794
00:56:42,670 --> 00:56:42,690
m 0 0 l 150 0 150 150 0 150

00:56:42,670 --> 00:56:42,690
m 0 0 l 150 0 150 150 0 150

1796
00:56:42,690 --> 00:56:42,700
Do-re-mi on the recorder

1797
00:56:42,690 --> 00:56:42,700
Play the perfect do-re-mi on the recorder

1798
00:56:42,690 --> 00:56:42,700
m 0 0 l 150 0 150 150 0 150

1800
00:56:42,700 --> 00:56:42,720
Do-re-mi on the recorder

1801
00:56:42,700 --> 00:56:42,720
Play the perfect do-re-mi on the recorder

1802
00:56:42,700 --> 00:56:42,720
m 0 0 l 150 0 150 150 0 150

m 0 0 l 150 0 150 150 0 150

1804
00:56:42,720 --> 00:56:42,740
Do-re-mi on the recorder

1805
00:56:42,720 --> 00:56:42,740
Play the perfect do-re-mi on the recorder

1806
00:56:42,720 --> 00:56:42,740
m 0 0 l 150 0 150 150 0 150

1807
00:56:42,720 --> 00:56:42,740
m 0 0 l 150 0 150 150 0 150

1808
00:56:42,740 --> 00:56:51,010
Do-re-mi on the recorder

1809
00:56:42,740 --> 00:56:51,010
Play the perfect do-re-mi on the recorder

1810
00:56:42,740 --> 00:56:51,010
m 0 0 l 150 0 150 150 0 150

1811
00:56:42,740 --> 00:56:51,010
m 0 0 l 150 0 150 150 0 150

1812
00:56:42,890 --> 00:56:45,790
Each of you will one by one, in order, use the recorder

1813
00:56:44,370 --> 00:56:47,990
Why do we have to
do something like this?

1814
00:56:45,790 --> 00:56:51,010
Play do-re-mi-fa-so-la-ti-do without slipping up

1815
00:56:51,010 --> 00:56:54,800
DO RE MI FA SO LA TI DO

1816
00:56:51,010 --> 00:57:04,310
Example

1817
00:56:51,010 --> 00:57:04,310
m 0 0 l 150 0 150 150 0 150

1818
00:56:51,460 --> 00:56:55,380
The start position requires all fingers to cover all holes

1819
00:56:54,800 --> 00:56:55,850
DO RE MI FA SO LA TI DO

1820
00:56:55,580 --> 00:56:57,750
This is diff...

1821
00:56:55,850 --> 00:56:56,920
DO RE MI FA SO LA TI DO

1822
00:56:56,920 --> 00:56:57,870
DO RE MI FA SO LA TI DO

1823
00:56:57,750 --> 00:57:00,790
Wonder if I can do it well

1824
00:56:57,870 --> 00:56:59,090
DO RE MI FA SO LA TI DO

1825
00:56:59,090 --> 00:57:00,090
DO RE MI FA SO LA TI DO

1826
00:57:00,090 --> 00:57:01,120
DO RE MI FA SO LA TI DO

1827
00:57:01,120 --> 00:57:02,190
DO RE MI FA SO LA TI DO

1828
00:57:02,190 --> 00:57:04,310
DO RE MI FA SO LA TI DO

1829
00:57:04,310 --> 00:57:06,330
Difficult

1830
00:57:04,460 --> 00:57:10,730
If you slip up you are out! Losers remain in the game!

1831
00:57:04,460 --> 00:57:10,730
If you slip up you are out! Losers remain in the game!

1832
00:57:10,300 --> 00:57:13,370
Why this

1833
00:57:10,750 --> 00:57:14,820
Lets! Challenge!

1834
00:57:10,750 --> 00:57:14,820
Lets! Challenge!

1835
00:57:10,750 --> 00:57:14,820
Lets! Challenge!

1836
00:57:14,820 --> 00:57:16,970
We will all try on the same one?

1837
00:57:16,970 --> 00:57:19,910
We will take turns, though

1838
00:57:17,870 --> 00:57:19,910
Taking turns

1839
00:57:19,910 --> 00:57:22,580
The first try counts

1840
00:57:21,310 --> 00:57:22,580
The first try counts

1841
00:57:22,580 --> 00:57:24,580
Here we go

1842
00:57:24,580 --> 00:57:26,250
That's right

1843
00:57:26,250 --> 00:57:28,850
Can't wait for that

1844
00:57:26,250 --> 00:57:28,850
I have to get my fingers ready

1845
00:57:29,450 --> 00:57:31,220
Ready, start

1846
00:57:33,240 --> 00:57:35,270
No no no

1847
00:57:33,990 --> 00:57:35,270
That's no good

1848
00:57:36,370 --> 00:57:38,560
Losers stay in

1849
00:57:37,160 --> 00:57:38,560
Like you are playing a shakuhachi

1850
00:57:37,160 --> 00:57:42,010
T/N: A shakuhachi is a traditional Japanese/Chinese flute made out of bamboo.

1851
00:57:40,010 --> 00:57:42,010
Like a shakuhachi

1852
00:57:41,180 --> 00:57:43,230
Messed up the "do"

1853
00:57:42,010 --> 00:57:43,230
Wrong from "do"

1854
00:57:46,030 --> 00:57:47,700
And I'm the one getting slapped?

1855
00:57:47,700 --> 00:57:50,540
Because you laughed

1856
00:57:48,450 --> 00:57:50,540
That's right

1857
00:57:50,840 --> 00:57:52,620
Hosei...

1858
00:57:52,620 --> 00:57:54,260
You look confident

1859
00:57:53,640 --> 00:57:54,560
I'm pretty good at this

1860
00:57:54,560 --> 00:57:57,080
I'm pretty good at this

1861
00:57:56,710 --> 00:57:57,630
Seriously?

1862
00:57:57,630 --> 00:57:59,580
Ready

1863
00:57:59,580 --> 00:58:00,500
Start

1864
00:58:01,450 --> 00:58:02,580
Yes

1865
00:58:06,590 --> 00:58:08,390
No good

1866
00:58:08,390 --> 00:58:10,860
He's bursting with laughter

1867
00:58:09,440 --> 00:58:10,860
Can't do that, Hamada

1868
00:58:11,110 --> 00:58:14,060
Hamada is bursting with laughter

1869
00:58:14,160 --> 00:58:17,630
A laughter free of any worry

1870
00:58:16,200 --> 00:58:17,630
Having too much fun

1871
00:58:18,530 --> 00:58:20,570
It went "ahowooohuoo-oo"

1872
00:58:19,800 --> 00:58:20,800
Why is everyone

1873
00:58:20,800 --> 00:58:23,870
Playing it like a shakuhachi?

1874
00:58:21,770 --> 00:58:23,220
Right?

1875
00:58:23,520 --> 00:58:25,090
Okay, here goes

1876
00:58:23,970 --> 00:58:25,090
Okay

1877
00:58:24,340 --> 00:58:25,090
Here you go

1878
00:58:25,090 --> 00:58:25,920
Ready

1879
00:58:25,920 --> 00:58:26,690
Start

1880
00:58:28,540 --> 00:58:30,530
What!?

1881
00:58:30,530 --> 00:58:31,860
That's right

1882
00:58:31,860 --> 00:58:33,260
Hamada laughed

1883
00:58:33,850 --> 00:58:35,750
Hamada is laughing every time

1884
00:58:35,750 --> 00:58:37,420
Why?

1885
00:58:36,080 --> 00:58:39,550
Hamada laughs every time

1886
00:58:38,570 --> 00:58:40,200
How come?

1887
00:58:40,200 --> 00:58:41,740
How can we accomplish this?

1888
00:58:43,090 --> 00:58:45,090
Here I go

1889
00:58:53,370 --> 00:58:56,000
No good!!

1890
00:58:54,620 --> 00:58:56,000
That's no good

1891
00:58:56,000 --> 00:58:58,900
It's pretty tough...

1892
00:58:59,140 --> 00:59:00,610
Make it sound nicer

1893
00:59:01,160 --> 00:59:03,240
I see

1894
00:59:02,040 --> 00:59:03,240
I see

1895
00:59:03,230 --> 00:59:06,110
Quit it with that skit

1896
00:59:04,230 --> 00:59:06,110
I forgot

1897
00:59:06,110 --> 00:59:07,830
That's right

1898
00:59:07,830 --> 00:59:09,800
That should've been fine

1899
00:59:09,800 --> 00:59:11,450
Not the last part

1900
00:59:10,050 --> 00:59:12,280
The last note was no good

1901
00:59:12,750 --> 00:59:14,890
But wasn't this one safe?

1902
00:59:14,190 --> 00:59:14,890
Right?

1903
00:59:14,890 --> 00:59:16,040
Right?

1904
00:59:15,650 --> 00:59:17,360
I think so too

1905
00:59:16,040 --> 00:59:17,360
The last part

1906
00:59:17,360 --> 00:59:19,430
But the end was...

1907
00:59:18,920 --> 00:59:21,630
If you say that then this bit will never end

1908
00:59:19,430 --> 00:59:24,330
Think about it a bit

1909
00:59:22,160 --> 00:59:24,330
Yeah, we have to do this

1910
00:59:25,630 --> 00:59:28,170
Sorry, but...

1911
00:59:28,170 --> 00:59:31,170
Let's make it easier

1912
00:59:29,870 --> 00:59:31,170
Right?

1913
00:59:31,170 --> 00:59:33,690
But just now was a bit...

1914
00:59:33,110 --> 00:59:35,090
That's right

1915
00:59:33,690 --> 00:59:35,090
Right?

1916
00:59:39,030 --> 00:59:40,450
That's enough. Thank you

1917
00:59:44,800 --> 00:59:47,890
That was quick. Why can't I do it?

1918
00:59:46,790 --> 00:59:47,520
That sounded like, "heehee"

1919
00:59:47,520 --> 00:59:50,290
He's straight up laughing

1920
00:59:48,290 --> 00:59:51,290
It went piii!!

1921
00:59:50,290 --> 00:59:52,290
Isn't this strange?

1922
00:59:53,260 --> 00:59:55,260
On the "do" part...

1923
00:59:55,860 --> 00:59:57,100
"Do" is not played right

1924
00:59:57,100 --> 00:59:59,830
"Do" is not played right

1925
00:59:57,530 --> 00:59:59,830
But it was played

1926
00:59:57,530 --> 00:59:59,830
Why can't we play it well?

1927
01:00:00,450 --> 01:00:02,940
Next up in the Nostalgic School Challenge

1928
01:00:02,380 --> 01:00:02,940
Huh?

1929
01:00:02,940 --> 01:00:07,440
Nostalgic School Challenge

1930
01:00:02,940 --> 01:00:07,440
Nostalgic School Challenge

1931
01:00:02,990 --> 01:00:04,170
Indoor shoes shoot

1932
01:00:02,990 --> 01:00:07,440
Indoor shoes shoot

1933
01:00:02,990 --> 01:00:07,440
Indoor shoes shoot

1934
01:00:02,990 --> 01:00:09,440
T/N: In Japan, you do not wear the same shoes you wear outside when you're inside. This also applies in schools where everyone is required to have a pair of indoor shoes.

1935
01:00:04,120 --> 01:00:07,440
Won't this also be hard?

1936
01:00:05,790 --> 01:00:07,440
Sure will be

1937
01:00:07,960 --> 01:00:09,980
Oh man, this is
pretty hard

1938
01:00:08,260 --> 01:00:12,650
Kick your shoes from about 2 meters distance

1939
01:00:12,760 --> 01:00:18,270
You win if the indoor shoes go into the trash can

1940
01:00:12,760 --> 01:00:18,270
You win if the indoor shoes go into the trash can

1941
01:00:12,760 --> 01:00:18,270
You win if the indoor shoes go into the trash can

1942
01:00:18,470 --> 01:00:25,590
Keep at it until you find the loser

1943
01:00:18,470 --> 01:00:25,590
Keep at it until you find the loser

1944
01:00:18,770 --> 01:00:20,870
Two meters, no problem

1945
01:00:22,570 --> 01:00:25,590
This will be decisive

1946
01:00:25,590 --> 01:00:26,630
I see

1947
01:00:25,780 --> 01:00:29,950
Let's! Challenge!

1948
01:00:25,780 --> 01:00:29,950
Let's! Challenge!

1949
01:00:25,780 --> 01:00:29,950
Let's! Challenge!

1950
01:00:26,630 --> 01:00:28,890
All of us are still left

1951
01:00:30,450 --> 01:00:32,260
Two meters?

1952
01:00:31,350 --> 01:00:32,260
Two meters

1953
01:00:32,260 --> 01:00:33,270
Where?

1954
01:00:33,270 --> 01:00:35,020
Let's all agree

1955
01:00:33,770 --> 01:00:35,020
Where would the two meter mark be?

1956
01:00:35,020 --> 01:00:37,640
Let's all decide and agree

1957
01:00:36,020 --> 01:00:37,640
Should we do it like this?

1958
01:00:37,640 --> 01:00:39,020
Let's put this down here

1959
01:00:39,020 --> 01:00:40,840
For the time being

1960
01:00:39,690 --> 01:00:40,840
Yes

1961
01:00:39,940 --> 01:00:40,840
Yes

1962
01:00:41,140 --> 01:00:42,510
You can't do that

1963
01:00:42,510 --> 01:00:44,510
Since they are leather shoes

1964
01:00:43,460 --> 01:00:47,180
Leather has nothing to do with it. You are out

1965
01:00:44,510 --> 01:00:46,650
He was practicing

1966
01:00:46,650 --> 01:00:49,150
He was practicing

1967
01:00:48,550 --> 01:00:50,970
We didn't confirm the distance

1968
01:00:50,470 --> 01:00:52,280
We all agreed on the distance, didn't we?

1969
01:00:50,970 --> 01:00:52,280
That's not okay...

1970
01:00:51,300 --> 01:00:52,280
He was practicing

1971
01:00:52,500 --> 01:00:54,020
But you are out

1972
01:00:54,640 --> 01:00:57,120
This has nothing to do with us

1973
01:00:55,240 --> 01:00:57,120
Let's be friends

1974
01:00:59,040 --> 01:01:00,180
What's up?

1975
01:01:00,560 --> 01:01:02,460
He hit my hand

1976
01:01:02,800 --> 01:01:05,900
I will go first, ok?

1977
01:01:03,830 --> 01:01:04,380
Yes

1978
01:01:04,380 --> 01:01:05,900
Let's move it across the room

1979
01:01:05,100 --> 01:01:05,900
Okay

1980
01:01:06,570 --> 01:01:07,600
Like this

1981
01:01:07,920 --> 01:01:11,270
Isn't it a disadvantage to go first?

1982
01:01:09,790 --> 01:01:11,270
Let's do rock-paper-scissors

1983
01:01:11,770 --> 01:01:15,110
It's because you already practiced once

1984
01:01:11,770 --> 01:01:15,110
No, because you went ahead and practiced

1985
01:01:15,110 --> 01:01:16,960
So strict

1986
01:01:17,280 --> 01:01:18,960
Do you want that throw to be the real thing? No? Then go

1987
01:01:18,960 --> 01:01:20,050
Here I go

1988
01:01:19,410 --> 01:01:20,050
Right

1989
01:01:19,580 --> 01:01:20,050
Yes

1990
01:01:25,350 --> 01:01:26,100
Nice

1991
01:01:26,100 --> 01:01:26,970
Nice

1992
01:01:26,640 --> 01:01:31,810
Matsumoto qualifies!!

1993
01:01:26,640 --> 01:01:31,810
Matsumoto qualifies!!

1994
01:01:26,640 --> 01:01:31,810
Matsumoto qualifies!!

1995
01:01:28,190 --> 01:01:29,420
Nice

1996
01:01:29,810 --> 01:01:31,810
Went straight in

1997
01:01:33,160 --> 01:01:35,060
I watched from over here and

1998
01:01:33,960 --> 01:01:35,060
Seriously?

1999
01:01:35,060 --> 01:01:37,530
I thought, "This is going to make it in"

2000
01:01:36,930 --> 01:01:38,930
Nice

2001
01:01:38,230 --> 01:01:41,180
"That was nice" is what my own partner said, of all people!!

2002
01:01:41,180 --> 01:01:44,540
My own partner ended up saying that

2003
01:01:44,620 --> 01:01:45,910
My own partner

2004
01:01:46,170 --> 01:01:49,980
Ends up saying, "That was nice"

2005
01:01:51,440 --> 01:01:54,010
My own partner...

2006
01:01:56,120 --> 01:01:58,870
Saying it as if he's at home, watching this on TV

2007
01:02:00,650 --> 01:02:01,300
That's just too...

2008
01:02:01,340 --> 01:02:01,740
You have a point

2009
01:02:03,510 --> 01:02:04,260
That right there is Hamada's...

2010
01:02:04,260 --> 01:02:07,490
"That was beautiful" just like that

2011
01:02:06,630 --> 01:02:09,280
But really though, that was well done

2012
01:02:07,560 --> 01:02:09,280
But this doesn't look good for us

2013
01:02:09,330 --> 01:02:10,450
Would you like to go next?

2014
01:02:11,510 --> 01:02:14,580
There's no way I'd want that Batsu game

2015
01:02:14,030 --> 01:02:14,580
No way

2016
01:02:14,580 --> 01:02:16,270
It's too much

2017
01:02:16,270 --> 01:02:16,940
Right?

2018
01:02:17,040 --> 01:02:20,170
Your practice round is what let you win, isn't it?

2019
01:02:18,970 --> 01:02:20,170
I agree!

2020
01:02:20,170 --> 01:02:21,160
He has a point there

2021
01:02:21,170 --> 01:02:25,180
Objection!!

2022
01:02:21,720 --> 01:02:23,590
That's true, that's just...

2023
01:02:23,590 --> 01:02:24,840
He already had a feel for it

2024
01:02:23,880 --> 01:02:26,000
Having that one practice round is so relevant

2025
01:02:26,000 --> 01:02:27,060
OKAY FINE

2026
01:02:27,760 --> 01:02:31,080
I'll let you guys have 2 chances

2027
01:02:30,120 --> 01:02:31,020
Are you serious?

2028
01:02:31,100 --> 01:02:33,470
I'll acknowledge that the first attempt was a miss

2029
01:02:34,150 --> 01:02:34,650
Okay

2030
01:02:35,490 --> 01:02:38,760
Even still, this is going to be hard...

2031
01:02:36,070 --> 01:02:38,560
If you don't get it within 2 tries, then that's a loss

2032
01:02:38,070 --> 01:02:39,480
Yes, I'll agree to that

2033
01:02:40,730 --> 01:02:42,090
This is a huge favor for a huge challenge

2034
01:02:42,090 --> 01:02:44,960
This is a huge favor for a huge challenge

2035
01:02:44,660 --> 01:02:45,950
"Huge challenge?" The hell am I saying?

2036
01:02:52,910 --> 01:02:55,070
You can't help but laugh

2037
01:02:56,260 --> 01:02:56,790
Just like that

2038
01:02:56,830 --> 01:02:57,740
If you watch it

2039
01:03:02,260 --> 01:03:06,750
Can such sorrow come from the back?

2040
01:03:05,950 --> 01:03:07,640
Well well, the first attempt was a miss

2041
01:03:07,990 --> 01:03:10,820
There was only sorrow coming from that

2042
01:03:11,570 --> 01:03:13,160
Your turn, Endo

2043
01:03:13,190 --> 01:03:16,300
Isn't Endo going to be really good at this?

2044
01:03:15,040 --> 01:03:15,740
I have some confidence

2045
01:03:18,800 --> 01:03:20,270
Ahhh, that was SO close!

2046
01:03:20,330 --> 01:03:22,370
But I got this

2047
01:03:20,830 --> 01:03:21,870
That was pretty good though

2048
01:03:23,150 --> 01:03:24,490
I think he could do it

2049
01:03:23,840 --> 01:03:24,490
I think so too

2050
01:03:24,970 --> 01:03:26,910
But really, I think this will determine everything

2051
01:03:26,960 --> 01:03:27,990
But how do you do it?

2052
01:03:28,940 --> 01:03:29,410
May I?

2053
01:03:29,510 --> 01:03:30,190
Yes of course

2054
01:03:30,530 --> 01:03:32,110
You just have to go with your gut feeling

2055
01:03:31,930 --> 01:03:32,800
"Gut feeling"?

2056
01:03:32,650 --> 01:03:33,380
Yep, that's right

2057
01:03:33,380 --> 01:03:33,760
Yes

2058
01:03:35,560 --> 01:03:36,970
Everyone's just imitating me

2059
01:03:37,100 --> 01:03:40,340
To shoot from way behind the towel

2060
01:03:41,950 --> 01:03:43,210
Ah, too much power

2061
01:03:45,890 --> 01:03:47,630
And if this makes it in

2062
01:03:48,330 --> 01:03:49,090
I can drop out of the competition

2063
01:03:49,130 --> 01:03:49,360
Yes

2064
01:03:51,060 --> 01:03:51,630
Here I go!

2065
01:04:00,910 --> 01:04:02,510
He's so bad at this

2066
01:04:01,160 --> 01:04:01,890
I saw that coming

2067
01:04:02,190 --> 01:04:03,680
Saw that coming

2068
01:04:06,530 --> 01:04:08,200
Oh, it even worked there

2069
01:04:07,860 --> 01:04:08,560
Yes yes

2070
01:04:09,420 --> 01:04:11,220
That guy is still at it

2071
01:04:11,230 --> 01:04:12,690
That's right, he's still doing it

2072
01:04:12,330 --> 01:04:14,170
Yes, I can laugh all I want

2073
01:04:13,490 --> 01:04:16,590
That's so nice

2074
01:04:14,700 --> 01:04:15,940
No matter how much I laugh...

2075
01:04:15,270 --> 01:04:16,860
Man, you're so lucky

2076
01:04:17,060 --> 01:04:18,260
So...

2077
01:04:18,470 --> 01:04:19,330
One more round, right?

2078
01:04:19,330 --> 01:04:20,260
We play one more round

2079
01:04:20,440 --> 01:04:21,680
This sucks

2080
01:04:20,910 --> 01:04:21,880
I can probably...

2081
01:04:21,690 --> 01:04:23,830
But if you can do this...

2082
01:04:21,730 --> 01:04:22,660
How is this going to work?

2083
01:04:31,070 --> 01:04:32,770
OUT!!

2084
01:04:34,410 --> 01:04:38,090
Losers remain, those are the rules

2085
01:04:35,520 --> 01:04:36,130
Alright

2086
01:04:36,180 --> 01:04:37,690
You'll get an OUT

2087
01:04:40,610 --> 01:04:42,980
He said "OUT" so desperately though

2088
01:04:42,980 --> 01:04:43,870
Losers remain

2089
01:04:44,680 --> 01:04:45,250
Here I go

2090
01:04:49,970 --> 01:04:51,740
Ahhh, that was so close...

2091
01:04:51,660 --> 01:04:55,490
OUT

2092
01:04:56,430 --> 01:04:57,180
He's totally laughing!

2093
01:04:58,110 --> 01:05:00,870
How do you do this?

2094
01:04:59,080 --> 01:05:00,670
You've been asking that a lot for a while now

2095
01:05:00,870 --> 01:05:02,230
But really though

2096
01:05:02,400 --> 01:05:07,070
It's best if you depict the parabola

2097
01:05:04,270 --> 01:05:06,240
You're not depicting the parabola at all

2098
01:05:13,260 --> 01:05:16,480
Hosei wins and drops out!!

2099
01:05:20,240 --> 01:05:23,470
Are you serious?

2100
01:05:23,490 --> 01:05:24,390
Yes, I did it!

2101
01:05:25,320 --> 01:05:26,330
I really did it!!

2102
01:05:26,330 --> 01:05:28,090
Are you really for real?

2103
01:05:33,070 --> 01:05:34,270
Why would you react like that?

2104
01:05:33,730 --> 01:05:34,470
Here I go...

2105
01:05:34,300 --> 01:05:35,880
You're right

2106
01:05:39,300 --> 01:05:40,690
YES!!

2107
01:05:39,300 --> 01:05:42,710
Tanaka wins and drops out!!

2108
01:05:42,880 --> 01:05:43,580
Yeah!

2109
01:05:43,580 --> 01:05:45,190
I hate this

2110
01:05:45,390 --> 01:05:46,080
Wait a minute

2111
01:05:46,160 --> 01:05:48,550
If everyone makes it in, then that changes things

2112
01:05:49,420 --> 01:05:52,890
With this progression, it'll end up with me and Endo

2113
01:05:50,570 --> 01:05:51,680
Oh right, that's right

2114
01:05:52,220 --> 01:05:53,690
You two

2115
01:05:52,890 --> 01:05:53,850
Is this game how we'll decide it?

2116
01:05:54,350 --> 01:05:57,320
Should we go back to the recorder?

2117
01:05:55,390 --> 01:05:57,020
I can't do that one...

2118
01:05:57,320 --> 01:05:57,720
The recorder?

2119
01:05:57,790 --> 01:05:58,310
The recorder

2120
01:05:57,790 --> 01:05:58,310
Yes

2121
01:05:58,570 --> 01:05:59,190
The recorder...

2122
01:05:59,360 --> 01:06:01,340
Let's go with the recorder

2123
01:06:00,280 --> 01:06:01,010
The flute

2124
01:06:01,480 --> 01:06:06,470
Hamada vs Endo

2125
01:06:01,480 --> 01:06:06,470
Recorder Do Re Mi Fa Sol La Ti Do Showdown

2126
01:06:03,380 --> 01:06:04,010
Who's going to start?

2127
01:06:04,130 --> 01:06:04,630
Who will start first?

2128
01:06:04,630 --> 01:06:05,250
Who should go?

2129
01:06:05,250 --> 01:06:06,280
Then I will start

2130
01:06:06,470 --> 01:06:07,050
You're going to start?

2131
01:06:07,050 --> 01:06:07,450
Yes

2132
01:06:12,450 --> 01:06:13,870
Before, Matsumoto did...

2133
01:06:14,970 --> 01:06:16,880
Here I go

2134
01:06:15,520 --> 01:06:16,440
Start!

2135
01:06:27,420 --> 01:06:28,320
Thanks

2136
01:06:28,370 --> 01:06:29,760
Well, well, well

2137
01:06:29,920 --> 01:06:32,020
My tone quality will be the factor

2138
01:06:32,020 --> 01:06:34,390
If Hamada's turns out better

2139
01:06:33,980 --> 01:06:36,530
Just now wasn't great, I'd give it around a 75

2140
01:06:36,530 --> 01:06:37,250
Yes, I agree

2141
01:06:38,900 --> 01:06:39,250
Here I go

2142
01:06:48,670 --> 01:06:52,080
You're like a snake charmer!!

2143
01:06:52,630 --> 01:06:54,750
Hamada, bottle rocket punishment!

2144
01:06:54,430 --> 01:06:59,920
Hamada Bottle Rocket Punishment

2145
01:06:54,810 --> 01:06:56,750
Of course this would happen

2146
01:06:56,770 --> 01:06:58,030
A cobra would've come out

2147
01:07:01,750 --> 01:07:03,720
Wow, here it comes

2148
01:07:03,310 --> 01:07:04,790
This is going to be scary, Hamada

2149
01:07:05,060 --> 01:07:06,460
There's three of them

2150
01:07:06,530 --> 01:07:07,510
This is scary

2151
01:07:06,530 --> 01:07:11,400
3 Continuous Hits of the Bottle Rocket

2152
01:07:06,530 --> 01:07:11,400
Ebitani Hiroshi

2153
01:07:06,530 --> 01:07:11,400
T/N: The Denjirou Army Corps is actually the Denjirou Science Production which is a group of scientists that educates children through fun film productions and shows.

2154
01:07:06,530 --> 01:07:11,400
Under Supervision of The Denjirou Army Corps

2155
01:07:08,480 --> 01:07:11,160
This is so scary

2156
01:07:09,750 --> 01:07:11,150
Very scary

2157
01:07:12,810 --> 01:07:13,320
Alright

2158
01:07:13,320 --> 01:07:13,720
Yes

2159
01:07:13,850 --> 01:07:14,370
Yes

2160
01:07:15,970 --> 01:07:17,740
While no one noticed...

2161
01:07:19,660 --> 01:07:20,290
Here please

2162
01:07:20,290 --> 01:07:20,690
Yes

2163
01:07:22,410 --> 01:07:23,310
This surrounding area is scary

2164
01:07:24,110 --> 01:07:29,060
The rocket's propulsion is powered by liquid nitrogen

2165
01:07:24,690 --> 01:07:25,390
So scary

2166
01:07:27,000 --> 01:07:28,710
What the hell are you doing?

2167
01:07:31,770 --> 01:07:35,700
Oh wow, this is scary

2168
01:07:33,570 --> 01:07:35,140
What the hell

2169
01:07:35,170 --> 01:07:36,360
Wait wait wait!

2170
01:07:36,620 --> 01:07:39,020
What the hell is this?

2171
01:07:37,040 --> 01:07:38,910
Yes, what is going on?

2172
01:07:40,290 --> 01:07:48,180
Until the rocket launch

2173
01:07:40,290 --> 01:07:48,180
seconds

2174
01:07:40,310 --> 01:07:41,380
It seems like it'll be loud

2175
01:07:41,380 --> 01:07:42,280
What the hell is going on?!

2176
01:07:42,080 --> 01:07:43,400
Until the bottle rocket launch

2177
01:07:48,270 --> 01:07:48,930
LAUNCH!

2178
01:07:55,210 --> 01:07:56,560
This is heavy

2179
01:08:04,520 --> 01:08:07,120
He got it good

2180
01:08:07,120 --> 01:08:10,160
Went right at the face at the very end!

2181
01:08:11,610 --> 01:08:13,430
You can't help, but laugh

2182
01:08:12,340 --> 01:08:13,290
OUCH

2183
01:08:14,130 --> 01:08:15,190
That last one to the face...

2184
01:08:16,230 --> 01:08:16,630
Ow

2185
01:08:18,710 --> 01:08:19,350
Ow ow

2186
01:08:19,430 --> 01:08:21,170
Straight to the frontal lobe

2187
01:08:22,020 --> 01:08:23,490
There's no helping it, you lost

2188
01:08:23,600 --> 01:08:24,390
Well, yes

2189
01:08:24,420 --> 01:08:25,350
Good job

2190
01:08:25,500 --> 01:08:26,320
Can't do anything about it

2191
01:08:26,540 --> 01:08:28,390
I'm so glad I got the slipper in

2192
01:08:28,610 --> 01:08:29,830
Wow

2193
01:08:31,790 --> 01:08:32,290
Here

2194
01:08:32,610 --> 01:08:35,110
That pisses me off

2195
01:08:33,630 --> 01:08:35,110
And that's the end of that, right Matsumoto?

2196
01:08:35,110 --> 01:08:36,520
And that's the end of mine

2197
01:08:37,080 --> 01:08:39,430
But it's only mine that's over

2198
01:08:38,270 --> 01:08:39,080
That's right!

2199
01:08:39,450 --> 01:08:41,490
We still have more!

2200
01:08:41,390 --> 01:08:41,770
Yes

2201
01:08:41,850 --> 01:08:42,550
May I?

2202
01:08:42,390 --> 01:08:43,140
Hosei

2203
01:08:43,140 --> 01:08:43,960
So scary

2204
01:08:44,570 --> 01:08:45,320
By the way,

2205
01:08:45,320 --> 01:08:51,500
You're still wearing the Unbeatable Baggy Pants and it's pissing me off

2206
01:08:46,330 --> 01:08:48,240
Oh right

2207
01:08:48,240 --> 01:08:48,590
Yes

2208
01:08:48,790 --> 01:08:50,050
What's it called? Something Baggy Pants

2209
01:08:49,910 --> 01:08:50,630
Unbeatable Baggy Pants

2210
01:08:50,380 --> 01:08:51,260
Right, Unbeatable Baggy Pants

2211
01:08:51,330 --> 01:08:52,180
What-cha-ma-call-pants

2212
01:08:52,100 --> 01:08:52,780
What is this?

2213
01:08:55,930 --> 01:08:56,300
OI

2214
01:08:56,300 --> 01:08:56,900
OI

2215
01:08:56,900 --> 01:08:57,600
OI

2216
01:08:57,600 --> 01:09:01,090
I hear there's some pretentious punk wearing baggy pants in this class

2217
01:08:57,600 --> 01:09:02,520
Delinquents barging in

2218
01:09:01,160 --> 01:09:02,740
Don't you dare mess with us!!

2219
01:09:02,980 --> 01:09:05,390
It's this guy

2220
01:09:03,660 --> 01:09:04,030
Yes

2221
01:09:04,080 --> 01:09:05,230
You're it, huh?

2222
01:09:05,240 --> 01:09:05,860
This fool

2223
01:09:05,860 --> 01:09:07,900
Ain't you a tough guy for wearing it so conceitedly?!

2224
01:09:07,900 --> 01:09:09,670
We're gonna do you in good!

2225
01:09:09,950 --> 01:09:13,920
THIS IS A MAME HIGH SCHOOL BAGGY PANTS HUNT

2226
01:09:13,390 --> 01:09:14,370
YOU'RE GONNA GET IT

2227
01:09:13,920 --> 01:09:17,560
I feel so bad for him

2228
01:09:16,460 --> 01:09:17,540
Wouldn't have imagined this would happen

2229
01:09:19,070 --> 01:09:20,830
Oh no, a baggy pants hunt

2230
01:09:19,360 --> 01:09:20,810
They're taking it away

2231
01:09:21,940 --> 01:09:25,150
Oh no, oh no, even his shoes, his shoes!

2232
01:09:24,900 --> 01:09:26,500
OW OW OW

2233
01:09:25,310 --> 01:09:26,930
So rough, so rough, so rough

2234
01:09:26,930 --> 01:09:27,800
So rough, so rough, so rough

2235
01:09:27,800 --> 01:09:30,970
Where're the pants you were wearing before?!

2236
01:09:29,120 --> 01:09:30,970
Where are they!?

2237
01:09:30,970 --> 01:09:33,470
Oh, they're in there

2238
01:09:34,040 --> 01:09:37,980
NEVER WEAR BAGGY PANTS AGAIN, YA HEAR ME?!

2239
01:09:35,810 --> 01:09:37,090
Oh, they took them!

2240
01:09:37,090 --> 01:09:38,390
Oh...

2241
01:09:38,480 --> 01:09:42,010
You're only down to your underwear

2242
01:09:42,230 --> 01:09:44,930
Yeah well... The same thing happened to me

2243
01:09:49,640 --> 01:09:52,360
White, so very white

2244
01:09:55,580 --> 01:09:56,880
They took your pants away

2245
01:09:56,930 --> 01:09:57,400
From now on,

2246
01:09:57,400 --> 01:09:58,460
It's going to hurt like hell from now on

2247
01:09:58,460 --> 01:10:01,730
It's going to hurt like hell from now on

2248
01:10:02,380 --> 01:10:04,840
It's because you were being so pretentious up until now

2249
01:10:04,150 --> 01:10:04,840
You're right

2250
01:10:04,970 --> 01:10:06,560
Oh, is this what it's all about?

2251
01:10:07,110 --> 01:10:10,640
But this was a good experience for you

2252
01:10:08,210 --> 01:10:08,460
That's right

2253
01:10:08,460 --> 01:10:09,520
Very true

2254
01:10:10,030 --> 01:10:10,640
I truly agree

2255
01:10:11,030 --> 01:10:11,690
So scary

2256
01:10:12,090 --> 01:10:13,650
Hosei, you have this right?

2257
01:10:13,880 --> 01:10:20,420
Key for locker #4

2258
01:10:14,080 --> 01:10:15,250
Are you serious?

2259
01:10:15,010 --> 01:10:15,780
This and...

2260
01:10:16,110 --> 01:10:17,170
I open this...

2261
01:10:18,520 --> 01:10:19,720
Well for now, I'll open the locker

2262
01:10:19,720 --> 01:10:20,070
Four

2263
01:10:20,370 --> 01:10:22,120
Tanaka, from now on, you really can't laugh

2264
01:10:22,120 --> 01:10:23,540
I won't laugh

2265
01:10:25,260 --> 01:10:28,440
What is this?

2266
01:10:26,190 --> 01:10:27,460
This is four, right?

2267
01:10:28,810 --> 01:10:30,200
Of course it was, you opened it

2268
01:10:31,600 --> 01:10:34,730
What the hell is this?

2269
01:10:32,410 --> 01:10:33,250
This...

2270
01:10:33,270 --> 01:10:35,100
Again, he gets those kinds of toys...

2271
01:10:34,000 --> 01:10:34,670
There it is

2272
01:10:35,120 --> 01:10:40,240
Joke masks x 3

2273
01:10:35,370 --> 01:10:37,820
Huh? I don't understand what's going on

2274
01:10:38,440 --> 01:10:39,810
I guess for now, just try them on, Hosei

2275
01:10:39,810 --> 01:10:42,720
Since this is your item and all

2276
01:10:44,880 --> 01:10:46,410
Getting hit for things like this is just bad

2277
01:10:46,410 --> 01:10:49,250
Getting hit for things like this is just bad

2278
01:10:47,280 --> 01:10:50,100
Yes, I agree, these kinds of things are unnecessary

2279
01:10:55,550 --> 01:10:57,510
Come on

2280
01:10:58,420 --> 01:11:00,030
No way, come on

2281
01:10:58,670 --> 01:11:00,630
No no no, this kind of thing...

2282
01:11:02,980 --> 01:11:04,910
Why is this a thing?

2283
01:11:03,730 --> 01:11:09,530
Exceptionally destructive joke masks

2284
01:11:05,710 --> 01:11:07,220
It's too much

2285
01:11:06,150 --> 01:11:06,900
OW!!

2286
01:11:08,280 --> 01:11:09,420
Ow, that hurts so bad

2287
01:11:09,530 --> 01:11:11,170
Amazing!!

2288
01:11:12,140 --> 01:11:15,910
That's so nice

2289
01:11:14,460 --> 01:11:15,520
That's amazing

2290
01:11:16,210 --> 01:11:18,990
This is really amazing

2291
01:11:21,510 --> 01:11:22,650
Please stop that pose

2292
01:11:22,960 --> 01:11:24,000
There he goes

2293
01:11:24,870 --> 01:11:26,950
There are directors who really look like that

2294
01:11:29,140 --> 01:11:31,440
Hosei, are the other ones different?

2295
01:11:31,460 --> 01:11:34,890
They're all different

2296
01:11:33,190 --> 01:11:34,240
Wow, so many

2297
01:11:34,240 --> 01:11:34,980
Yes there are

2298
01:11:35,140 --> 01:11:36,180
Tanaka, hurts a lot doesn't it?

2299
01:11:36,180 --> 01:11:38,310
This really hurts so much

2300
01:11:37,280 --> 01:11:38,310
Of course

2301
01:11:42,580 --> 01:11:44,840
Please stop

2302
01:11:46,570 --> 01:11:48,660
There's someone who looks like that

2303
01:11:48,460 --> 01:11:50,460
This is not good

2304
01:11:50,480 --> 01:11:53,150
This part below his nose is long

2305
01:11:51,330 --> 01:11:54,030
What the hell! Then give me some item like that too

2306
01:11:55,610 --> 01:11:57,620
That would hurt

2307
01:11:55,610 --> 01:11:57,680
Ow!!

2308
01:11:57,680 --> 01:11:59,680
That would hurt

2309
01:11:58,780 --> 01:12:00,790
Ow, that hurts

2310
01:12:01,390 --> 01:12:05,360
These joke masks are amazing

2311
01:12:05,860 --> 01:12:07,980
These aren't sold normally, right?

2312
01:12:07,990 --> 01:12:12,110
He's wearing a student uniform, but he looks old

2313
01:12:10,560 --> 01:12:12,510
That might be it. How unbalanced it is

2314
01:12:12,930 --> 01:12:14,100
It makes it more...

2315
01:12:21,610 --> 01:12:24,110
There's a comedian like that

2316
01:12:22,990 --> 01:12:26,700
That's right. Who is it? There's someone like that

2317
01:12:24,140 --> 01:12:25,630
There's a comedian like that

2318
01:12:27,430 --> 01:12:28,450
There's someone like that

2319
01:12:27,430 --> 01:12:30,550
Pisses me off

2320
01:12:31,730 --> 01:12:32,550
Ow!

2321
01:12:37,590 --> 01:12:41,080
That's an amazing item

2322
01:12:39,560 --> 01:12:41,690
It looks like the whole thing is a mask

2323
01:12:41,090 --> 01:12:42,040
Yup, yup

2324
01:12:42,090 --> 01:12:46,530
This works really well

2325
01:12:43,760 --> 01:12:46,530
because it's Hosei, don't you think?

2326
01:12:45,130 --> 01:12:47,000
Is that what it is?

2327
01:12:47,000 --> 01:12:48,980
What would happen if someone else wore it?

2328
01:12:51,670 --> 01:12:53,670
Wow, amazing!

2329
01:12:53,670 --> 01:12:56,780
It's not that strange

2330
01:12:59,680 --> 01:13:01,960
Yeah, there's definitely
someone who looks like that

2331
01:13:05,520 --> 01:13:07,750
Ow!

2332
01:13:10,460 --> 01:13:11,470
This is amazing, isn't it?

2333
01:13:11,470 --> 01:13:12,470
It's amazing

2334
01:13:12,470 --> 01:13:14,730
It works for anyone

2335
01:13:16,190 --> 01:13:17,330
This is...

2336
01:13:17,330 --> 01:13:20,600
These kinds of things don't work that well for me

2337
01:13:18,560 --> 01:13:20,600
These kinds of things don't work that well for me

2338
01:13:20,600 --> 01:13:23,100
For me, these kinds of things don't work that well...

2339
01:13:24,540 --> 01:13:26,960
What do I do with this, I put them on my eyes?

2340
01:13:28,810 --> 01:13:30,410
Hehe...

2341
01:13:30,410 --> 01:13:33,580
You're laughing

2342
01:13:33,600 --> 01:13:34,310
If you would, please

2343
01:13:37,650 --> 01:13:41,350
That's just not fair!!

2344
01:13:41,350 --> 01:13:43,360
This is no good. No good

2345
01:13:43,940 --> 01:13:45,920
It's a different genre

2346
01:13:46,260 --> 01:13:49,280
The venue is different!!

2347
01:13:47,210 --> 01:13:48,740
You should look at yourself

2348
01:13:48,740 --> 01:13:49,510
Come on

2349
01:13:53,770 --> 01:13:55,670
Ow!

2350
01:13:56,030 --> 01:13:58,940
The venue is different

2351
01:13:56,080 --> 01:13:57,620
This is amazing

2352
01:13:58,540 --> 01:13:59,890
Wow

2353
01:14:00,260 --> 01:14:01,760
You guys are malicious!

2354
01:14:00,710 --> 01:14:02,410
The level is different

2355
01:14:03,170 --> 01:14:07,080
We can't beat that

2356
01:14:07,080 --> 01:14:09,260
There's nothing above that

2357
01:14:09,260 --> 01:14:11,300
No more, please. Can't deal with that

2358
01:14:11,300 --> 01:14:12,070
Wow

2359
01:14:12,070 --> 01:14:16,100
Yes, if you could please take it off and we can talk normally

2360
01:14:13,750 --> 01:14:16,390
Don't wander around with that on too much

2361
01:14:16,450 --> 01:14:19,460
He can do anything

2362
01:14:18,390 --> 01:14:21,840
Yes. He really can skillfully do anything

2363
01:14:19,460 --> 01:14:22,290
Check it out!!

2364
01:14:29,670 --> 01:14:32,150
You can't do that, please

2365
01:14:30,370 --> 01:14:32,200
No, no, no

2366
01:14:33,190 --> 01:14:36,110
Please take it off

2367
01:14:33,810 --> 01:14:36,110
You can't do that

2368
01:14:36,110 --> 01:14:39,340
That guy would not be popular with the ladies

2369
01:14:38,390 --> 01:14:39,310
It hurts

2370
01:14:40,260 --> 01:14:42,360
Wow, that's good

2371
01:14:40,550 --> 01:14:41,380
Ow!

2372
01:14:42,360 --> 01:14:45,220
Tanaka, that hurts, right? That's gotta hurt

2373
01:14:44,070 --> 01:14:45,220
It hurts like crazy

2374
01:14:45,220 --> 01:14:45,580
That's exhausting. That's really exhausting me

2375
01:14:45,580 --> 01:14:48,350
That's exhausting. That's really exhausting me

2376
01:14:48,350 --> 01:14:50,360
Take it off for now

2377
01:14:49,540 --> 01:14:51,310
How about we hide it and reset everything?

2378
01:14:52,170 --> 01:14:54,110
No, he's just... This is not good

2379
01:14:55,030 --> 01:14:58,410
He's making weird movements...

2380
01:14:58,760 --> 01:15:01,220
I can't look at that. Please stop for our sake

2381
01:15:05,840 --> 01:15:08,620
Please stop, already

2382
01:15:07,240 --> 01:15:08,910
He's getting carried away

2383
01:15:09,590 --> 01:15:11,590
Hamada, please take it off

2384
01:15:11,590 --> 01:15:13,450
Seriously, seriously

2385
01:15:13,450 --> 01:15:16,830
He's strangely taken a liking to it

2386
01:15:16,850 --> 01:15:18,670
Oh no, he's taken a liking...

2387
01:15:19,180 --> 01:15:22,450
Why is he using it as if it's his own item

2388
01:15:19,220 --> 01:15:21,490
He's strangely taken a liking to it

2389
01:15:21,620 --> 01:15:22,470
Yeah

2390
01:15:22,540 --> 01:15:25,460
That was in Hosei's place

2391
01:15:25,470 --> 01:15:29,640
Most of all, if you're laughing no one can tell. That's the worst part

2392
01:15:29,290 --> 01:15:30,630
Ok, ok

2393
01:15:30,630 --> 01:15:33,200
That's against the rules

2394
01:15:31,060 --> 01:15:32,410
I mean I guess that's right

2395
01:15:35,480 --> 01:15:40,440
That anatomical model...

2396
01:15:39,700 --> 01:15:41,710
Anatomical model

2397
01:15:40,570 --> 01:15:41,770
Anatomical model

2398
01:15:42,520 --> 01:15:45,790
It might just be a coincidence,

2399
01:15:45,790 --> 01:15:49,560
but it looks like Hamada

2400
01:15:47,980 --> 01:15:50,300
It wasn't made specifically to be like that, right?

2401
01:15:51,680 --> 01:15:53,950
It's subtle

2402
01:15:53,950 --> 01:15:55,950
Or am I wrong?

2403
01:16:00,830 --> 01:16:04,400
That's Hamada

2404
01:16:06,360 --> 01:16:08,070
Is it?

2405
01:16:08,720 --> 01:16:10,340
Yeah, that's Hamada

2406
01:16:10,570 --> 01:16:13,470
They made this?

2407
01:16:12,500 --> 01:16:14,420
So this is Hamada!

2408
01:16:13,470 --> 01:16:19,410
Anatomical Model of a Young Hamada

2409
01:16:15,660 --> 01:16:16,980
It's Hamada

2410
01:16:16,360 --> 01:16:19,340
This is Hamada

2411
01:16:19,810 --> 01:16:24,750
They left it there so that someone might notice and look

2412
01:16:24,750 --> 01:16:27,890
Should I go next, then?

2413
01:16:29,990 --> 01:16:31,970
Eh? What's that?

2414
01:16:31,990 --> 01:16:36,590
Mysterious DVD

2415
01:16:35,010 --> 01:16:39,500
Can you play it for me?

2416
01:16:35,490 --> 01:16:36,590
There it is

2417
01:16:39,860 --> 01:16:41,830
Whoa!!

2418
01:16:42,930 --> 01:16:44,820
You know what this is, right?

2419
01:16:44,850 --> 01:16:46,620
It's Kokkuri-san

2420
01:16:44,850 --> 01:16:48,970
T/N: Kokkuri-san is a table-turning game like Ouija where you call upon the spirits to answer your questions.

2421
01:16:44,970 --> 01:16:49,020
A Kokkuri-san Board

2422
01:16:46,070 --> 01:16:48,970
This is that scary thing, I don't really like these, too scary...

2423
01:16:49,060 --> 01:16:51,780
I'm gonna play it

2424
01:16:56,750 --> 01:17:02,890
Kokkuri-san

2425
01:16:57,320 --> 01:17:02,340
Kokkuri-san: A necromantic divination that has been performed since long ago

2426
01:17:03,340 --> 01:17:05,310
T/N: Kokkuri-san is usually played with a 10-yen coin.

2427
01:17:03,340 --> 01:17:05,310
With a 500 yen coin

2428
01:17:05,310 --> 01:17:08,780
and this board of letters...

2429
01:17:08,830 --> 01:17:16,370
Call upon Kokkuri-san and raise a question

2430
01:17:08,830 --> 01:17:16,370
The ghost "Kokkuri-san" will point to the truth

2431
01:17:16,370 --> 01:17:38,390
Correct Sequence

2432
01:17:16,370 --> 01:17:38,390
Everyone puts their index finger on the 500 yen coin,

2433
01:17:16,370 --> 01:17:38,390
If you have come forth, please proceed to 'Yes'"

2434
01:17:16,370 --> 01:17:38,390
and says, "Kokkuri-san, Kokkuri-san, please come forth.

2435
01:17:22,260 --> 01:17:23,310
Everyone does it together

2436
01:17:24,390 --> 01:17:26,390
This is so scary,
I don't like this

2437
01:17:29,780 --> 01:17:38,390
Once this is said, the 500 yen coin should be making its way towards "Yes"

2438
01:17:37,020 --> 01:17:38,040
Is this real?

2439
01:17:39,670 --> 01:17:43,830
I always thought someone else was moving it...

2440
01:17:41,990 --> 01:17:43,830
Because I didn't move it

2441
01:17:43,830 --> 01:17:45,750
Yes, you don't move it yourself

2442
01:17:47,430 --> 01:17:50,440
This is 5 people

2443
01:17:48,820 --> 01:17:51,340
Kokkuri-san, Kokkuri-san, please come forth

2444
01:17:52,190 --> 01:17:54,060
Tanaka, here

2445
01:17:56,360 --> 01:18:00,750
Kokkuri-san, Kokkuri-san, please come forth

2446
01:18:00,800 --> 01:18:03,650
If you have come forth,

2447
01:18:03,650 --> 01:18:08,420
please proceed to "Yes"

2448
01:18:09,750 --> 01:18:11,760
Are you serious...?

2449
01:18:11,090 --> 01:18:13,530
It's moving

2450
01:18:13,530 --> 01:18:16,630
Seriously?

2451
01:18:17,460 --> 01:18:21,570
The 500 yen coin goes to "Yes"

2452
01:18:18,180 --> 01:18:19,860
Seriously?

2453
01:18:19,850 --> 01:18:21,570
Is this real?

2454
01:18:22,670 --> 01:18:24,740
I'm really not moving it

2455
01:18:23,520 --> 01:18:24,740
Me neither

2456
01:18:24,870 --> 01:18:26,860
I'm really not moving it, either

2457
01:18:26,860 --> 01:18:29,590
Now, a question for the five of you

2458
01:18:30,480 --> 01:18:37,650
Kokkuri-san, Kokkuri-san,

2459
01:18:32,940 --> 01:18:37,650
who among us will receive a Thai kick after this?

2460
01:18:37,650 --> 01:18:38,380
Hold on

2461
01:18:38,380 --> 01:18:40,850
Hold on

2462
01:18:41,790 --> 01:18:44,420
You can't decide that like this

2463
01:18:43,100 --> 01:18:44,870
This is scary. What is going on?

2464
01:18:44,820 --> 01:18:46,890
No one deliberately direct it anywhere!!

2465
01:18:46,890 --> 01:18:48,890
That would not be right

2466
01:18:47,880 --> 01:18:48,890
Let's not do that

2467
01:18:49,540 --> 01:18:51,500
Like if you start pulling on it if it starts to go to you...

2468
01:18:51,530 --> 01:18:54,130
Let's absolutely not do that!!

2469
01:18:52,500 --> 01:18:53,460
That's right

2470
01:18:53,460 --> 01:18:55,480
Got it

2471
01:18:53,460 --> 01:18:55,480
Got it

2472
01:18:55,030 --> 01:18:56,570
Let's leave it to Kokkuri-san

2473
01:18:56,570 --> 01:18:57,940
You'd be broken into bits

2474
01:18:56,570 --> 01:19:01,970
Tanaka has received Thai kicks 10 years in a row

2475
01:18:57,940 --> 01:18:59,090
I would

2476
01:19:00,490 --> 01:19:01,970
How would this work, though?

2477
01:19:01,970 --> 01:19:02,890
Shall we?

2478
01:19:05,140 --> 01:19:06,980
Kokkuri-san, Kokkuri-san,

2479
01:19:07,100 --> 01:19:08,230
who among us

2480
01:19:08,300 --> 01:19:13,820
will receive a Thai kick after this?

2481
01:19:14,950 --> 01:19:17,510
Wow, it's moving!!

2482
01:19:16,640 --> 01:19:19,590
This is really...

2483
01:19:17,510 --> 01:19:19,540
It's moving pretty quickly

2484
01:19:21,130 --> 01:19:23,190
It's really here

2485
01:19:23,950 --> 01:19:56,730
"Ta"

2486
01:19:30,340 --> 01:19:32,040
Really

2487
01:19:32,040 --> 01:19:34,040
I'm really not doing anything

2488
01:19:33,000 --> 01:19:34,640
No way, come on

2489
01:19:34,790 --> 01:19:37,510
Who's pushing on it?

2490
01:19:37,690 --> 01:19:56,730
"Na"

2491
01:19:38,510 --> 01:19:43,450
Someone's really pushing on it

2492
01:19:44,400 --> 01:19:49,040
Tanaka, you're really pushing on it

2493
01:19:52,220 --> 01:19:56,730
"Ka"

2494
01:19:53,910 --> 01:19:56,730
Hold on, don't let go yet

2495
01:19:58,760 --> 01:20:01,800
There's no way, right!?

2496
01:20:00,130 --> 01:20:01,580
It went here

2497
01:20:01,800 --> 01:20:03,580
No way it's me

2498
01:20:03,740 --> 01:20:05,400
It went, "Tanaka"

2499
01:20:04,000 --> 01:20:05,440
It went, "Tanaka"

2500
01:20:05,440 --> 01:20:07,540
Why when it's time for a Thai kick...

2501
01:20:09,310 --> 01:20:10,210
That was fast

2502
01:20:11,460 --> 01:20:13,230
That was fast, the decision

2503
01:20:14,050 --> 01:20:16,010
You want to do it again?

2504
01:20:14,050 --> 01:20:17,280
Wasn't that decision kinda fast?

2505
01:20:15,130 --> 01:20:16,710
But still

2506
01:20:16,060 --> 01:20:17,280
Tanaka, watch out

2507
01:20:17,280 --> 01:20:20,820
I get it, but I can't do this wearing this. Seriously

2508
01:20:21,140 --> 01:20:22,070
This...

2509
01:20:22,100 --> 01:20:22,390
Hold on

2510
01:20:22,390 --> 01:20:23,720
Hold on

2511
01:20:23,740 --> 01:20:25,040
Seriously, hold on

2512
01:20:26,160 --> 01:20:27,260
Hold on, just a bit!!

2513
01:20:27,260 --> 01:20:29,230
Hold on, just a bit!!

2514
01:20:29,180 --> 01:20:32,150
What do you mean, "Just a bit?"

2515
01:20:29,230 --> 01:20:31,230
I can't do it wearing this

2516
01:20:32,430 --> 01:20:35,270
Watch out!

2517
01:20:36,070 --> 01:20:37,000
Matsumoto!!

2518
01:20:37,000 --> 01:20:37,840
Matsumoto!!

2519
01:20:37,840 --> 01:20:39,100
Matsumoto, please!!

2520
01:20:39,100 --> 01:20:40,220
Hold on

2521
01:20:39,200 --> 01:20:41,240
Tanaka, stay still

2522
01:20:40,710 --> 01:20:43,220
I get it, I get it

2523
01:20:43,170 --> 01:20:45,180
Go over to wide open area

2524
01:20:43,940 --> 01:20:46,390
Be gentle with him

2525
01:20:46,390 --> 01:20:46,840
Mr. Thai Kick, please be gentle with him, I'm telling him

2526
01:20:46,840 --> 01:20:49,760
Mr. Thai Kick, please be gentle with him, I'm telling him

2527
01:20:49,760 --> 01:20:51,770
I can't take a Thai kick this early

2528
01:20:51,670 --> 01:20:53,270
I understand

2529
01:20:52,620 --> 01:20:55,950
I can't accept this, not like that

2530
01:20:53,270 --> 01:20:55,270
Stay still

2531
01:20:55,950 --> 01:20:58,870
Put your hands out front and stay still

2532
01:21:00,660 --> 01:21:02,640
Stay still, stay still

2533
01:21:00,980 --> 01:21:02,080
Watch out

2534
01:21:02,930 --> 01:21:05,510
Ah Ahh!!

2535
01:21:05,860 --> 01:21:08,570
Ah hahhh!!

2536
01:21:14,660 --> 01:21:17,330
Aghhhh...

2537
01:21:22,110 --> 01:21:24,220
It's a mystery, though

2538
01:21:25,620 --> 01:21:26,520
What's the matter?

2539
01:21:31,070 --> 01:21:33,140
His shoulder, too?

2540
01:21:33,140 --> 01:21:35,110
What's the matter? Your armpit?

2541
01:21:35,110 --> 01:21:37,060
His shoulder hurts too

2542
01:21:35,110 --> 01:21:37,110
Oh, your shoulder too

2543
01:21:37,580 --> 01:21:43,030
I thought you were protecting yourself,

2544
01:21:39,000 --> 01:21:43,030
but it was just your aging shoulder hurting again

2545
01:21:41,750 --> 01:21:43,030
Ahh... This time... Aren't we sitting too much?

2546
01:21:43,030 --> 01:21:45,270
Ahh... This time... Aren't we sitting too much?

2547
01:21:44,740 --> 01:21:46,700
It's tough

2548
01:21:45,270 --> 01:21:46,700
Ahh... This time... Aren't we sitting too much?

2549
01:21:46,700 --> 01:21:50,240
Yeah. It's been slow

2550
01:21:46,700 --> 01:21:50,240
You're right, this year is pretty different

2551
01:21:51,240 --> 01:21:52,680
Man, I really want my pants back

2552
01:21:52,680 --> 01:21:54,780
Hah!!

2553
01:21:57,050 --> 01:21:59,630
I can't be walking around like this

2554
01:22:01,990 --> 01:22:04,660
Don't just say such normal things!!

2555
01:22:05,760 --> 01:22:08,080
Of course I'll say that

2556
01:22:06,520 --> 01:22:09,490
Don't come here and say such normal things!!

2557
01:22:08,080 --> 01:22:09,490
Of course I'll say that

2558
01:22:09,980 --> 01:22:12,000
I'm being hit like this the whole time

2559
01:22:11,430 --> 01:22:13,600
Are you okay?

2560
01:22:13,970 --> 01:22:15,350
Have you gotten red marks on your thighs?

2561
01:22:15,370 --> 01:22:19,540
Uuooh! Wooah woah woah!!

2562
01:22:19,550 --> 01:22:22,170
Yeah, it doesn't get that bad with pants on

2563
01:22:20,920 --> 01:22:22,170
Yeah, exactly

2564
01:22:22,220 --> 01:22:23,370
Tanaka!

2565
01:22:22,660 --> 01:22:23,370
Ah, they're here!

2566
01:22:23,370 --> 01:22:26,180
How long are you gonna prance around with no pants?

2567
01:22:24,780 --> 01:22:28,250
See?

2568
01:22:26,180 --> 01:22:28,250
Wish and it'll come true, Tanaka

2569
01:22:29,350 --> 01:22:32,020
Finally got some pants!

2570
01:22:33,530 --> 01:22:38,020
3 hours into their school life

2571
01:22:35,370 --> 01:22:38,020
They get no time to catch their breath

2572
01:22:41,090 --> 01:22:42,590
Are you ready?

2573
01:22:42,590 --> 01:22:46,760
The broadcasting club will be doing their noon broadcast

2574
01:22:45,230 --> 01:22:46,760
so we should go check it out

2575
01:22:46,760 --> 01:22:56,910
Observing the broadcast club

2576
01:22:46,760 --> 01:22:56,910
The school's noon broadcast!!

2577
01:22:47,850 --> 01:22:50,370
They have a school radio show?

2578
01:22:48,730 --> 01:22:50,370
Observing the broadcast club...

2579
01:22:50,820 --> 01:22:53,070
We have to go observe them?

2580
01:22:52,490 --> 01:22:53,070
Right

2581
01:22:53,570 --> 01:22:56,910
Can't we just listen to them from here?

2582
01:22:54,210 --> 01:22:56,910
We shouldn't need to observe them...

2583
01:23:02,260 --> 01:23:06,180
Why you are out of Cream Rolls? Explain yourself

2584
01:23:05,170 --> 01:23:06,980
Ehhm... you see...

2585
01:23:05,230 --> 01:23:08,950
School store

2586
01:23:06,180 --> 01:23:08,950
"Ehhm"?

2587
01:23:06,980 --> 01:23:08,170
Um...

2588
01:23:08,170 --> 01:23:11,120
I had them prepared, but...

2589
01:23:08,950 --> 01:23:11,120
You had them prepared, but you don't have them

2590
01:23:11,120 --> 01:23:14,260
They got sold out...

2591
01:23:11,760 --> 01:23:12,420
There should always be Cream Rolls here at this time, should there not?

2592
01:23:12,420 --> 01:23:14,260
There should always be Cream Rolls here at this time, should there not?

2593
01:23:14,260 --> 01:23:18,630
Well, yeah that's right but..

2594
01:23:15,630 --> 01:23:18,630
Why are there no Cream Rolls here then?

2595
01:23:19,000 --> 01:23:21,570
They all got sold...

2596
01:23:19,760 --> 01:23:21,570
You sold all of them?

2597
01:23:20,950 --> 01:23:21,570
Yes

2598
01:23:21,570 --> 01:23:26,050
Predicting these things is the job of a bakery, is it not?

2599
01:23:23,330 --> 01:23:26,070
Predicting these things is the job of a bakery, is it not?

2600
01:23:23,770 --> 01:23:26,070
We did try to account for it...

2601
01:23:26,070 --> 01:23:28,920
It says "Super popular Cream Rolls" on the poster

2602
01:23:26,600 --> 01:23:28,920
Stop with the excuses

2603
01:23:28,920 --> 01:23:31,480
"Super popular Cream Rolls" it says right here

2604
01:23:31,060 --> 01:23:33,740
Yes

2605
01:23:31,480 --> 01:23:33,740
I wonder why there might be no Cream Rolls left then

2606
01:23:33,740 --> 01:23:34,600
No... It's just a coincidence that we sold out

2607
01:23:34,580 --> 01:23:37,080
No... It's just a coincidence that we sold out

2608
01:23:35,510 --> 01:23:37,080
A coincidence?

2609
01:23:37,080 --> 01:23:39,420
That's just an excuse, isn't it?

2610
01:23:39,420 --> 01:23:41,040
By the way. Can you do "Maaa," I wonder

2611
01:23:41,020 --> 01:23:43,490
By the way. Can you do "Maaa," I wonder

2612
01:23:43,700 --> 01:23:47,490
The "Maaa"

2613
01:23:45,570 --> 01:23:47,490
Asking him to do it is...

2614
01:23:47,490 --> 01:23:52,200
That's enough...

2615
01:23:48,630 --> 01:23:52,200
It's not that famous of a gag...

2616
01:23:57,670 --> 01:23:59,600
Try doing it right now

2617
01:24:00,000 --> 01:24:01,570
MAAAAAA

2618
01:24:01,570 --> 01:24:03,210
One more time

2619
01:24:03,890 --> 01:24:05,210
MAAAAAA

2620
01:24:05,340 --> 01:24:07,550
With all you've got

2621
01:24:06,690 --> 01:24:07,550
MAAAAAA

2622
01:24:10,670 --> 01:24:15,220
Ahh, why do they have to do that here??

2623
01:24:12,400 --> 01:24:15,220
They're really into "Maaa" today...

2624
01:24:14,240 --> 01:24:17,740
Enough! Enough!

2625
01:24:16,250 --> 01:24:20,610
She's really into "Maaa"...

2626
01:24:23,290 --> 01:24:26,500
From now on properly stock Cream Rolls, okay?

2627
01:24:24,830 --> 01:24:26,500
She's still talking?

2628
01:24:26,960 --> 01:24:29,630
It's my absolute favorite

2629
01:24:28,900 --> 01:24:29,630
Certainly

2630
01:24:29,930 --> 01:24:34,970
Broadcast club studio

2631
01:24:31,000 --> 01:24:32,450
It's about time

2632
01:24:34,370 --> 01:24:36,620
Okay, let's enter

2633
01:24:36,620 --> 01:24:38,630
Everyone sit down right here

2634
01:24:38,580 --> 01:24:42,450
Since Tanaka is trying out for the club

2635
01:24:42,450 --> 01:24:44,980
Please sit in the chair at the far right

2636
01:24:44,980 --> 01:24:48,450
I'm trying out the club?

2637
01:24:48,840 --> 01:24:52,290
And now,

2638
01:24:49,750 --> 01:24:52,290
will the cast please come in!!

2639
01:24:53,130 --> 01:24:54,920
There they come

2640
01:24:58,240 --> 01:25:01,190
That took us by surprise!

2641
01:25:04,210 --> 01:25:06,060
What??

2642
01:25:05,230 --> 01:25:08,830
I watched you guys!

2643
01:25:06,060 --> 01:25:08,830
I watched you guys this morning!

2644
01:25:08,830 --> 01:25:09,780
This morning!

2645
01:25:10,020 --> 01:25:13,700
They got here super quick

2646
01:25:10,100 --> 01:25:13,700
Broadcast club member

2647
01:25:10,100 --> 01:25:13,700
Broadcast club member

2648
01:25:10,100 --> 01:25:13,700
Haruna Kondo

2649
01:25:10,100 --> 01:25:13,700
Koji Kato

2650
01:25:10,100 --> 01:25:13,700
T/N: These two broadcast club members are announcers on the live morning TV show, "SUKKIRI!!" It airs every weekday from 8am to 10:25am.

2651
01:25:12,740 --> 01:25:14,540
Yes, I saw them on TV in the morning

2652
01:25:13,700 --> 01:25:17,070
They got here quick, huh

2653
01:25:17,070 --> 01:25:18,590
We're live with the school report in 5 seconds!

2654
01:25:18,580 --> 01:25:20,080
We're live with the school report in 5 seconds!

2655
01:25:19,390 --> 01:25:20,380
FOUR, THREE, TWO

2656
01:25:20,080 --> 01:25:21,980
School report?

2657
01:25:20,380 --> 01:25:21,360
FOUR, THREE, TWO

2658
01:25:21,360 --> 01:25:23,310
FOUR, THREE, TWO

2659
01:25:21,980 --> 01:25:23,310
It's "SUKKIRI"

2660
01:25:23,310 --> 01:25:29,650
School  Report  Broadcast

2661
01:25:23,310 --> 01:25:29,650
The  Noon Time

2662
01:25:24,520 --> 01:25:25,980
Here they go

2663
01:25:28,040 --> 01:25:30,990
Oma~me~

2664
01:25:28,040 --> 01:25:30,990
T/N: Reminder, this school is called Omame High School.

2665
01:25:30,990 --> 01:25:32,870
Good morning

2666
01:25:31,540 --> 01:25:32,870
Good morning                                               Good morning

2667
01:25:32,870 --> 01:25:35,360
Today is Tuesday, the 31st of December and this is The Noon Time School Report

2668
01:25:36,610 --> 01:25:39,660
Today's commentators are class 3-A's Tetsuya Miyazaki

2669
01:25:38,600 --> 01:25:45,140
3rd year, Class A

2670
01:25:38,600 --> 01:25:45,140
3rd year, Class C

2671
01:25:38,600 --> 01:25:45,140
T/N: Both Miyazaki and Kikuchi are regular commentators on SUKKIRI. Miyazaki is a critic of politics, religion, and philosophy while Kikuchi is an attorney.

2672
01:25:38,600 --> 01:25:45,140
Tetsuya Miyazaki

2673
01:25:38,600 --> 01:25:45,140
Yukio Kikuchi

2674
01:25:39,660 --> 01:25:42,770
Class 3-C's Yukio Kikuchi

2675
01:25:41,250 --> 01:25:45,140
Incredible! Those are the real deal too!

2676
01:25:42,770 --> 01:25:45,140
And provisional club member, Tanaka-kun

2677
01:25:45,140 --> 01:25:46,640
Nice to have you here

2678
01:25:46,640 --> 01:25:50,340
And with today's top story, here is Asami Miura

2679
01:25:48,140 --> 01:25:50,340
T/N: She is an Asami Miura look-alike who coincidentally is an actual announcer. Her name is Hanasaki Ayumi.

2680
01:25:48,140 --> 01:25:50,340
The female student looks just like Asami Miura

2681
01:25:50,680 --> 01:25:55,850
Recently, without notifying the school

2682
01:25:53,480 --> 01:25:55,850
two students participated in unauthorized part-time work

2683
01:25:55,850 --> 01:25:59,920
The two were promptly expelled from school

2684
01:25:56,250 --> 01:25:58,350
They must've gone to
great lengths for this

2685
01:25:58,780 --> 01:25:59,920
This topic...

2686
01:25:59,920 --> 01:26:03,450
I was a bit taken aback, but what are your thoughts, Haruna?

2687
01:26:03,870 --> 01:26:05,420
Indeed, I feel the same way

2688
01:26:05,420 --> 01:26:09,690
I have a few things I'd like to say on this broadcast

2689
01:26:09,690 --> 01:26:12,110
and I hope I get the chance to talk about them here today

2690
01:26:12,110 --> 01:26:14,930
I've been keeping an eye on this school ever since I enrolled here,

2691
01:26:14,930 --> 01:26:17,100
and I too have some thoughts I'd like to share about the current situation

2692
01:26:17,890 --> 01:26:21,310
When going over the details of this case again more thoroughly

2693
01:26:21,540 --> 01:26:27,910
it was discovered that last month,

2694
01:26:23,440 --> 01:26:27,910
the two students had also done unauthorized part-time work

2695
01:26:30,350 --> 01:26:34,090
Hold on, this topic is a bit...

2696
01:26:34,540 --> 01:26:37,290
The topic...!

2697
01:26:35,370 --> 01:26:37,290
No no no no

2698
01:26:36,340 --> 01:26:37,290
Is this okay?

2699
01:26:40,290 --> 01:26:44,600
I feel like I've seen this before

2700
01:26:42,490 --> 01:26:44,600
I wonder if this is alright

2701
01:26:44,900 --> 01:26:47,770
When the school questioned them harshly

2702
01:26:47,870 --> 01:26:51,470
They both stated, "We didn't receive any money for the work"

2703
01:26:51,500 --> 01:26:57,780
But it was then discovered that it was a lie

2704
01:26:55,210 --> 01:26:57,780
so the two students decided to hold a full school assembly

2705
01:26:57,780 --> 01:27:00,080
Let's have a look at that conference

2706
01:26:58,080 --> 01:27:00,080
I've seen this somewhere...

2707
01:27:09,400 --> 01:27:12,760
Morley Robertson

2708
01:27:09,400 --> 01:27:12,760
Robert Campbell

2709
01:27:09,400 --> 01:27:12,760
Third year, class B

2710
01:27:09,400 --> 01:27:12,760
Third year, class C

2711
01:27:09,400 --> 01:27:12,760
m 0 0 l 765 0 765 105 0

2712
01:27:09,400 --> 01:27:12,760
m 0 0 l 765 0 765 105 0

2713
01:27:09,400 --> 01:27:16,740
T/N: Robert Campbell and Morley Robertson are both American TV celebrities in Japan. Robert is a Japanese literature professor while Morley is a DJ and journalist.

2714
01:27:14,910 --> 01:27:18,300
This segment is evil!

2715
01:27:14,910 --> 01:27:18,300
What is this!?

2716
01:27:15,390 --> 01:27:18,300
This is no good

2717
01:27:18,980 --> 01:27:21,570
This can't be allowed

2718
01:27:19,110 --> 01:27:23,430
This is horrible! Making us laugh like this

2719
01:27:23,430 --> 01:27:26,240
This segment is pure evil

2720
01:27:24,070 --> 01:27:26,240
It's about that, that one thing

2721
01:27:26,800 --> 01:27:33,130
For working a part-time job

2722
01:27:33,840 --> 01:27:39,020
and for disappointing you all with our actions

2723
01:27:40,500 --> 01:27:42,950
we ask for your forgiveness

2724
01:27:43,640 --> 01:27:44,910
From the bottom of our hearts

2725
01:27:45,410 --> 01:27:47,990
We are truly sorry

2726
01:27:45,410 --> 01:27:47,990
We are truly sorry

2727
01:27:50,930 --> 01:27:58,200
We wanted to apologize to the school as soon as the news broke

2728
01:27:58,640 --> 01:28:06,910
However, we were banned from holding a school assembly by the principal

2729
01:27:58,640 --> 01:28:15,750
T/N: This segment is a parody of the scandal regarding Yoshimoto comedians, Hiroyuki Miyasako and Ryo Tamura. Miyasako and Tamura (along with others) performed at an event for an organized crime group and was stopped by Yoshimoto in holding a press conference/public apology. Miyasako initially stated that he was not paid, but turned out to be a lie.

2730
01:28:07,830 --> 01:28:12,170
When we went to the principal

2731
01:28:12,170 --> 01:28:15,750
You're not recording this, are ya?

2732
01:28:15,950 --> 01:28:19,820
T/N: This "You're not recording this, are ya?" is really what the Yoshimoto CEO had said to Miyasako and Tamura. He later said it was supposed to be a joke, but it was in poor taste.

2733
01:28:15,950 --> 01:28:19,820
You're not recording this, are ya?

2734
01:28:22,660 --> 01:28:25,560
Really!?

2735
01:28:23,080 --> 01:28:25,560
Nooo no no no no

2736
01:28:25,560 --> 01:28:29,370
No no no! They're really cutting deep into this

2737
01:28:28,750 --> 01:28:30,170
Ack, right?

2738
01:28:30,170 --> 01:28:33,470
They're really cutting deep here

2739
01:28:31,040 --> 01:28:32,740
Right!

2740
01:28:31,620 --> 01:28:33,450
Leaving nothing untouched

2741
01:28:32,740 --> 01:28:35,510
I don't like this segment...

2742
01:28:35,740 --> 01:28:40,280
The principal said, "It's because we are a family"

2743
01:28:41,500 --> 01:28:48,920
But if the school is the parent, then that means us students are the children

2744
01:28:51,440 --> 01:28:53,370
Does that mean you hate school?

2745
01:28:53,390 --> 01:28:59,210
Do you hate school?

2746
01:28:54,510 --> 01:28:59,210
I have nothing, but gratitude towards this school,
raising an idiot like me

2747
01:28:54,510 --> 01:28:59,210
T/N: Again, these were all based on things that were really said regarding the scandal.

2748
01:29:01,600 --> 01:29:05,690
Please stop!

2749
01:29:06,400 --> 01:29:10,320
Can we please stop this parody...

2750
01:29:08,010 --> 01:29:10,320
This is...

2751
01:29:11,430 --> 01:29:14,750
This is a dangerous thing to go into

2752
01:29:15,230 --> 01:29:20,330
Watching those two,
who are always telling such lighthearted American jokes

2753
01:29:20,990 --> 01:29:23,590
having to apologize while knee deep in tears

2754
01:29:25,210 --> 01:29:28,930
To me that was indescribably sad and hard to watch

2755
01:29:29,330 --> 01:29:30,760
Haruna, what did you think?

2756
01:29:31,130 --> 01:29:34,200
Saying they are like a family

2757
01:29:34,200 --> 01:29:37,170
Normally, if the company is like parent...

2758
01:29:38,140 --> 01:29:41,440
She managed to say "company"

2759
01:29:39,950 --> 01:29:42,240
She said "company"!

2760
01:29:44,740 --> 01:29:47,180
Honest mistake

2761
01:29:44,740 --> 01:29:47,180
m 0 0 l 516 0 516 90 0

2762
01:29:47,650 --> 01:29:49,050
You meant school, right?

2763
01:29:51,020 --> 01:29:52,730
That's a real event

2764
01:29:53,020 --> 01:29:55,290
The "company" is for the real deal

2765
01:29:55,640 --> 01:29:57,150
This is a parody, remember?

2766
01:29:56,100 --> 01:29:57,150
By the way

2767
01:29:57,150 --> 01:30:00,260
I'm not sure if this is okay to say, but...

2768
01:30:00,310 --> 01:30:04,200
EVERYONE IS SCARED!!

2769
01:30:12,540 --> 01:30:18,380
Enough!! This isn't okay, right? This is terrible

2770
01:30:18,530 --> 01:30:21,080
Really is terrible

2771
01:30:19,180 --> 01:30:21,080
This is a real thing

2772
01:30:21,080 --> 01:30:23,060
So about this situation

2773
01:30:23,110 --> 01:30:25,520
Tanaka, what are your thoughts?

2774
01:30:25,370 --> 01:30:30,340
There are a few things I don't quite understand

2775
01:30:30,620 --> 01:30:34,170
But if something like this really were to happen

2776
01:30:34,170 --> 01:30:37,760
I would think it was pretty bad

2777
01:30:36,630 --> 01:30:37,760
You know, I..

2778
01:30:38,230 --> 01:30:40,360
really want to hear your true, honest opinion

2779
01:30:40,760 --> 01:30:43,870
Kato, I...

2780
01:30:41,770 --> 01:30:43,870
IT WOULD BE REAL NICE IF YOU COULD SHUT UP!!

2781
01:30:48,610 --> 01:30:49,920
I'm sorry...

2782
01:30:54,380 --> 01:30:57,480
They're not handling this like the TV show, Miyazaki

2783
01:30:57,750 --> 01:31:00,330
I wonder, can this kind of school give its students a good life?

2784
01:31:00,330 --> 01:31:02,720
I wonder, can this kind of school give its students a good life?

2785
01:31:02,720 --> 01:31:05,660
WITH THIS CURRENT SYSTEM!!

2786
01:31:09,440 --> 01:31:12,060
The hell was that...?

2787
01:31:15,870 --> 01:31:17,970
Do those things really happen?

2788
01:31:23,710 --> 01:31:26,780
Matsumoto

2789
01:31:26,780 --> 01:31:32,050
It might be really rude of me to say this to a senior like you, Matsumoto

2790
01:31:32,050 --> 01:31:32,570
Here it comes. The quote

2791
01:31:32,170 --> 01:31:35,590
Here it is. Here it is

2792
01:31:32,550 --> 01:31:34,620
Here it comes. The quote

2793
01:31:34,620 --> 01:31:38,490
The principal is the school's highest position

2794
01:31:38,820 --> 01:31:42,530
A school where the leader can't take responsibility

2795
01:31:42,660 --> 01:31:45,530
T/N: This is what Matsumoto really said regarding Yoshimoto Agency's reaction to the scandal on an episode of SUKKIRI.

2796
01:31:42,660 --> 01:31:45,530
is that even functioning!?

2797
01:31:49,530 --> 01:31:51,770
That is a good impersonation

2798
01:31:52,540 --> 01:31:56,410
Here...

2799
01:31:53,500 --> 01:31:56,410
He said that

2800
01:31:56,410 --> 01:31:59,680
You said that

2801
01:31:58,030 --> 01:31:59,680
Yeah yeah, I said that

2802
01:31:59,830 --> 01:32:01,680
Anyways

2803
01:32:02,630 --> 01:32:06,620
I do think we have to change the current system

2804
01:32:06,700 --> 01:32:08,750
If this goes on any further

2805
01:32:09,140 --> 01:32:10,850
then I'll leave!

2806
01:32:11,290 --> 01:32:14,260
I will leave this school!

2807
01:32:22,550 --> 01:32:25,300
I'm sorry

2808
01:32:27,870 --> 01:32:29,110
Haruna, what do you think?

2809
01:32:29,670 --> 01:32:31,080
Uhm

2810
01:32:32,410 --> 01:32:36,960
That such a final statement

2811
01:32:38,420 --> 01:32:42,900
is being said on the school broadcast

2812
01:32:42,900 --> 01:32:45,860
makes me wish the school administration

2813
01:32:46,710 --> 01:32:49,280
could take proper notice

2814
01:32:50,040 --> 01:32:53,600
Like Haruna is saying...

2815
01:32:50,980 --> 01:32:53,600
That such a

2816
01:32:54,570 --> 01:32:58,170
final statement

2817
01:32:58,370 --> 01:33:01,620
She's doubling down!

2818
01:33:02,940 --> 01:33:04,510
What's up with those glasses?

2819
01:33:03,610 --> 01:33:07,280
Right... Is she crying?

2820
01:33:05,590 --> 01:33:07,280
I think she's crying

2821
01:33:10,950 --> 01:33:13,730
And well...

2822
01:33:11,270 --> 01:33:13,730
That such a final statement

2823
01:33:14,490 --> 01:33:18,690
is being said here

2824
01:33:14,750 --> 01:33:22,860
Waterfall of tears

2825
01:33:19,390 --> 01:33:22,840
makes me wish the school administration

2826
01:33:23,480 --> 01:33:26,510
Oh my...

2827
01:33:30,280 --> 01:33:31,220
No no

2828
01:33:31,370 --> 01:33:34,300
She's crying, right?

2829
01:33:31,890 --> 01:33:34,300
Haruna

2830
01:33:33,040 --> 01:33:34,300
Haruna

2831
01:33:36,470 --> 01:33:38,580
Haruna, we understand...

2832
01:33:38,580 --> 01:33:40,610
You couldn't help, but let out your feelings

2833
01:33:39,430 --> 01:33:40,610
Yeah

2834
01:33:40,610 --> 01:33:43,410
Everyone is trying to keep it together

2835
01:33:43,830 --> 01:33:46,330
I'll say it one more time

2836
01:33:46,350 --> 01:33:48,900
If this situation goes on any longer I'll leave this school

2837
01:33:48,890 --> 01:33:50,820
If this situation goes on any longer I'll leave this school

2838
01:33:51,960 --> 01:33:53,360
SORRY TO INTRUDE!!

2839
01:33:56,560 --> 01:33:57,390
I just listened to the entire broadcast!!

2840
01:33:56,560 --> 01:34:02,400
T/N: This is Takashi Yoshimura who is the boke from the comedy duo, Heisei Nobushikobushi.

2841
01:33:57,390 --> 01:33:59,760
I just listened to the entire broadcast!!

2842
01:33:58,450 --> 01:33:59,760
He came

2843
01:34:00,500 --> 01:34:02,400
If my senior is leaving then so am I!

2844
01:34:02,400 --> 01:34:03,530
Kato!

2845
01:34:03,530 --> 01:34:07,340
If Kato is leaving then I'm leaving too!

2846
01:34:04,870 --> 01:34:07,340
YOU DON'T HAVE ANYTHING TO DO WITH THIS!!

2847
01:34:07,340 --> 01:34:09,110
A real idiot has arrived

2848
01:34:09,110 --> 01:34:10,710
Haruna, it was tough for you too, right!

2849
01:34:12,340 --> 01:34:14,550
I'm just a underclassman, but I've been thinking

2850
01:34:14,550 --> 01:34:17,180
KEEP YOUR ASS OUT OF THIS!

2851
01:34:16,950 --> 01:34:19,180
Kato!

2852
01:34:19,420 --> 01:34:21,620
I'm serious...

2853
01:34:20,280 --> 01:34:22,890
This isn't about you!

2854
01:34:21,620 --> 01:34:22,900
Kato... Kato... Kato... Kato...

2855
01:34:22,890 --> 01:34:23,950
Kato... Kato... Kato... Kato...

2856
01:34:23,470 --> 01:34:25,110
Keep out of this!

2857
01:34:23,950 --> 01:34:25,110
Kato... Kato... Kato... Kato...

2858
01:34:25,090 --> 01:34:27,060
Kato... Kato... Kato... Kato...

2859
01:34:27,470 --> 01:34:28,890
This doesn't have anything to do with you!

2860
01:34:29,390 --> 01:34:29,530
Hey hey hey, calm down

2861
01:34:29,530 --> 01:34:29,690
Hey hey hey, calm down

2862
01:34:29,690 --> 01:34:29,930
Hey hey hey, calm down

2863
01:34:29,930 --> 01:34:32,860
Hey hey hey, calm down

2864
01:34:30,830 --> 01:34:32,860
YOU'RE THE LEAST RELATED TO THIS OUT OF ANYONE HERE!

2865
01:34:40,040 --> 01:34:42,170
Dang, he's intense

2866
01:34:44,980 --> 01:34:47,740
He's just a commentator

2867
01:34:47,740 --> 01:34:49,780
Please help us

2868
01:34:50,030 --> 01:34:52,550
I beg you to help save us

2869
01:34:52,550 --> 01:34:56,120
Matsumoto, Hamada, please help us

2870
01:34:56,120 --> 01:35:00,460
We all like this school, don't we?

2871
01:35:00,460 --> 01:35:03,090
I LOVE this school!

2872
01:35:03,090 --> 01:35:04,560
So I really don't want it to be over

2873
01:35:04,560 --> 01:35:07,630
Let's join hands one more time

2874
01:35:07,630 --> 01:35:09,500
and make this school a lively place once more!

2875
01:35:09,500 --> 01:35:12,340
and make this school a lively place once more!

2876
01:35:12,340 --> 01:35:13,900
CUE THE MUSIC

2877
01:35:20,410 --> 01:35:22,710
This makes no sense!

Wait, wait, wait

Geez

That was insane

3343
01:36:56,340 --> 01:36:58,380
They left in a hurry

3344
01:36:57,490 --> 01:36:58,380
What a surprise

3345
01:36:58,630 --> 01:37:00,630
We're still in the first half of the show

3346
01:37:00,540 --> 01:37:05,170
New Project: Escape Game

3347
01:37:01,030 --> 01:37:03,730
After this is a new project, the Escape Game!

3348
01:37:05,200 --> 01:37:10,290
Downtown First Manzai in Approx. 30 Years

3349
01:37:05,500 --> 01:37:09,840
And for some reason, Downtown's starting their first manzai in 30 years!

3350
01:37:13,060 --> 01:37:14,220
Eh!?

3351
01:37:14,220 --> 01:37:15,790
What is going on?

3352
01:37:15,790 --> 01:37:18,260
Whoa... This is scary!

3353
01:37:18,260 --> 01:37:20,860
Is there a fight going on?

3354
01:37:20,960 --> 01:37:23,150
There's a fight? Isn't that a bit early?

3355
01:37:23,020 --> 01:37:23,620
Right!

3356
01:37:24,840 --> 01:37:27,500
There's quite a racket

3357
01:37:25,100 --> 01:37:33,480
Men's bathroom

3358
01:37:27,500 --> 01:37:30,170
Shall we go check it out...?

3359
01:37:31,380 --> 01:37:33,480
Come on, get out!

3360
01:37:34,060 --> 01:37:36,060
Come on!

3361
01:37:38,580 --> 01:37:39,720
Tanaka... You're tall. Help him

3362
01:37:39,720 --> 01:37:41,790
Tanaka... You're tall. Help him

3363
01:37:42,850 --> 01:37:45,090
Help him

3364
01:37:45,410 --> 01:37:45,960
Help him, Tanaka

3365
01:37:46,140 --> 01:37:47,620
Hold on... Yes

3366
01:37:48,560 --> 01:37:48,960
Hey, please stop...

3367
01:37:48,960 --> 01:37:52,030
Hey, please stop...

3368
01:37:52,110 --> 01:37:53,830
WHO THE HELL ARE YOU!!

3369
01:37:53,830 --> 01:37:56,430
Um... I'm just a new student here

3370
01:37:56,430 --> 01:37:59,700
THE HELL IS THIS CHIN, HUH!!

3371
01:37:59,840 --> 01:38:01,760
Who invited this big chin bastard!?

3372
01:38:07,640 --> 01:38:08,830
That must've been scary

3373
01:38:08,830 --> 01:38:10,330
That hurt so much

3374
01:38:11,100 --> 01:38:13,250
That hurt...

3375
01:38:13,530 --> 01:38:15,390
That hurt so much!

3376
01:38:15,340 --> 01:38:21,330
Get your ass in gear! Come out!

3377
01:38:21,460 --> 01:38:22,160
OY! What is going on here!?

3378
01:38:22,160 --> 01:38:24,490
OY! What is going on here!?

3379
01:38:24,490 --> 01:38:25,400
You punks!

3380
01:38:30,970 --> 01:38:33,570
Bunch of bad guys

3381
01:38:33,570 --> 01:38:35,570
Are you okay?

3382
01:38:35,570 --> 01:38:39,580
They must have done quite the number on him...

3383
01:38:35,920 --> 01:38:39,140
Are you okay? It's safe out here now

3384
01:38:40,540 --> 01:38:41,280
It's okay

3385
01:38:50,800 --> 01:38:55,430
Shiro Ito (Actor)

3386
01:38:57,010 --> 01:39:00,560
I didn't get it for a brief moment

3387
01:39:02,600 --> 01:39:04,050
He's been properly bullied

3388
01:39:10,920 --> 01:39:14,580
"Cheater" is written on his face...

3389
01:39:12,990 --> 01:39:15,000
T/N: Shiro was on a program called "Ito Family" where they would explore everyday secret tricks and life hacks, which in Japanese is "urawaza". But "urawaza" is also used as slang to describe cheaters in video games and such.

3390
01:39:16,400 --> 01:39:18,380
T/N: "Oshin" is a TV drama from 1983 where Shiro played the father of the main character. May be a jab at how his debut role doesn't even warrant naming him by his actual character's name.

3391
01:39:16,400 --> 01:39:19,550
Oshin's father

3392
01:39:19,800 --> 01:39:21,230
That's his breakout role!

3393
01:39:27,060 --> 01:39:28,230
"Cheater" is going too far

3394
01:39:31,560 --> 01:39:32,730
I've had enough already

3395
01:39:33,560 --> 01:39:35,350
Is this for real?

3396
01:39:34,850 --> 01:39:35,770
That's a real problem

3397
01:39:36,030 --> 01:39:38,940
Bullying is absolutely not allowed

3398
01:39:38,990 --> 01:39:39,540
Let's go

3399
01:39:40,170 --> 01:39:40,720
Excuse us

3400
01:39:40,700 --> 01:39:42,710
Nice to meet you. Good luck

3401
01:39:41,970 --> 01:39:42,620
Excuse us

3402
01:39:42,610 --> 01:39:43,790
Excuse us

3403
01:39:44,830 --> 01:39:47,140
4 hours have passed of
their school day

3404
01:39:45,330 --> 01:39:49,810
4 hours into their school life

3405
01:39:47,990 --> 01:39:52,150
They're not just tired,
their butts are also doing worse

3406
01:39:53,250 --> 01:39:53,520
Ow

3407
01:39:53,520 --> 01:39:53,780
Ow

3408
01:39:53,780 --> 01:39:54,050
Ow

3409
01:39:54,050 --> 01:39:54,320
Ow

3410
01:39:54,320 --> 01:39:56,500
Ow

3411
01:39:57,790 --> 01:39:58,720
The butt pain always starts with Tanaka

3412
01:39:58,720 --> 01:40:00,820
The butt pain always starts with Tanaka

3413
01:40:00,820 --> 01:40:01,840
Ah, is that right...

3414
01:40:01,890 --> 01:40:04,060
This year might be extra bad, though

3415
01:40:04,060 --> 01:40:06,530
The Thai kick is having it's effect too

3416
01:40:04,850 --> 01:40:06,530
Yeah, the Thai kick is in there too

3417
01:40:07,200 --> 01:40:13,170
Of all Japanese people,

3418
01:40:08,930 --> 01:40:10,730
the one who's received the most Thai kicks must be Tanaka

3419
01:40:10,730 --> 01:40:13,170
the one who's received the most Thai kicks must be Tanaka

3420
01:40:11,700 --> 01:40:13,150
Do you really think so? Of all Japanese people?

3421
01:40:13,170 --> 01:40:16,510
I even think more than the people of Thailand!!

3422
01:40:14,570 --> 01:40:15,660
I've taken a lot...

3423
01:40:16,590 --> 01:40:17,220
But out of...

3424
01:40:16,940 --> 01:40:20,980
But you're getting used to them (Thai kicks), right?

3425
01:40:19,480 --> 01:40:21,600
Honestly speaking, watching that last Thai Kick,

3426
01:40:20,990 --> 01:40:26,580
Suspicion of Tanaka getting used to the Thai kicks

3427
01:40:21,600 --> 01:40:25,450
I thought, "Hmm, Tanaka is starting to get used to them"

3428
01:40:22,750 --> 01:40:26,480
No no no, I was shocked. Completely shocked

3429
01:40:26,580 --> 01:40:28,650
But it was so lame

3430
01:40:34,260 --> 01:40:36,010
Give me a break, please

3431
01:40:39,600 --> 01:40:42,930
You must understand that there isn't a set way to react

3432
01:40:42,970 --> 01:40:43,970
The way you are in pain makes us laugh

3433
01:40:43,970 --> 01:40:46,200
The way you are in pain makes us laugh

3434
01:40:46,400 --> 01:40:46,970
Because of the way you go "Aaa! Aaa!"

3435
01:40:46,970 --> 01:40:47,720
Because of the way you go "Aaa! Aaa!"

3436
01:40:47,720 --> 01:40:49,210
Because of the way you go "Aaa! Aaa!"

3437
01:40:49,210 --> 01:40:51,730
And it seems like you're doing it to make us laugh

3438
01:40:51,840 --> 01:40:53,910
You did it so nonchalantly today

3439
01:40:54,090 --> 01:41:00,750
2018's Treasure Hunters

3440
01:40:54,440 --> 01:40:57,000
Let's have a look at what
Hamada is talking about

3441
01:40:57,410 --> 01:41:00,130
How Tanaka reacts
to the Thai kick pain

3442
01:41:02,270 --> 01:41:04,350
Aaa~ha! Come on!!

3443
01:41:05,310 --> 01:41:07,520
Aaa~ha! Come on!!

3444
01:41:08,590 --> 01:41:10,260
Aaah

3445
01:41:10,260 --> 01:41:12,160
Aaaagh

3446
01:41:20,440 --> 01:41:22,060
What are you doing?

3447
01:41:22,070 --> 01:41:23,710
He's so loud

3448
01:41:24,020 --> 01:41:29,350
The suspicious reaction of this year's Thai kick

3449
01:41:29,600 --> 01:41:31,180
Aa Aaah!!

3450
01:41:31,180 --> 01:41:32,420
Aah Haa!!

3451
01:41:32,570 --> 01:41:34,150
Aa Aaah!!

3452
01:41:34,130 --> 01:41:35,020
Even with your hands

3453
01:41:34,150 --> 01:41:35,450
Aah Haa!!

3454
01:41:35,890 --> 01:41:37,250
You just naturally raise your arms

3455
01:41:41,580 --> 01:41:43,360
Ahhhhhhh...

3456
01:41:43,540 --> 01:41:50,970
It does seem like a fake reaction compared to previous years

3457
01:41:48,850 --> 01:41:51,750
That isn't true, it really hurts

3458
01:41:51,200 --> 01:41:53,300
You said "Aaa" once and got straight up on your feet

3459
01:41:53,300 --> 01:41:57,040
You said "Aaa" once and got straight up on your feet

3460
01:41:54,120 --> 01:41:57,040
He was standing even before he was done screaming

3461
01:41:57,310 --> 01:42:01,040
You continued as if nothing happened

3462
01:41:59,040 --> 01:42:00,440
Lies lies lies lies

3463
01:42:00,460 --> 01:42:01,900
Lies lies lies!

3464
01:42:01,680 --> 01:42:02,810
Previous times your face turned pale and such

3465
01:42:02,810 --> 01:42:05,450
Previous times your face turned pale and such

3466
01:42:03,200 --> 01:42:04,930
That's not true at all

3467
01:42:05,450 --> 01:42:07,780
Hanging out on the floor for ages

3468
01:42:06,830 --> 01:42:07,780
We would be worried for you

3469
01:42:08,450 --> 01:42:09,750
We would be at the exact threshold between worry and laughter

3470
01:42:09,750 --> 01:42:11,120
We would be at the exact threshold between worry and laughter

3471
01:42:11,120 --> 01:42:13,020
We would be at the exact threshold between worry and laughter

3472
01:42:11,710 --> 01:42:13,970
Yes, but today was surely no different

3473
01:42:14,270 --> 01:42:15,760
Not really, it didn't seem that bad...

3474
01:42:16,890 --> 01:42:19,030
Even now it's still hurting like hell

3475
01:42:19,660 --> 01:42:21,770
So it really did hurt today?

3476
01:42:22,130 --> 01:42:25,150
Fufu

3477
01:42:23,000 --> 01:42:24,870
Please, Matsumoto. Please stop

3478
01:42:25,400 --> 01:42:26,100
There's no way Thai kicks don't hurt

3479
01:42:26,100 --> 01:42:28,140
There's no way Thai kicks don't hurt

3480
01:42:28,140 --> 01:42:28,910
Did it hurt less than usual?

3481
01:42:28,910 --> 01:42:31,340
Did it hurt less than usual?

3482
01:42:30,310 --> 01:42:31,890
Last year's was like...

3483
01:42:32,080 --> 01:42:34,340
It's okay to be honest here, Tanaka

3484
01:42:34,460 --> 01:42:36,910
Well, compared to last year's...

3485
01:42:36,910 --> 01:42:38,210
Painful things hurt. That's a given

3486
01:42:38,210 --> 01:42:39,980
Painful things hurt. That's a given

3487
01:42:39,980 --> 01:42:41,080
But compared to last year, it didn't hurt as much

3488
01:42:41,080 --> 01:42:42,120
But compared to last year, it didn't hurt as much

3489
01:42:42,120 --> 01:42:45,660
But compared to last year, it didn't hurt as much

3490
01:42:44,270 --> 01:42:45,170
He said it...!

3491
01:42:48,930 --> 01:42:50,590
You're such a let down!!

3492
01:42:53,460 --> 01:42:55,230
We're trying to give you a trick question and now I feel let down!

3493
01:43:01,350 --> 01:43:03,910
What I mean with "Compared to last year it didn't hurt as much," is

3494
01:43:03,910 --> 01:43:06,380
Last year when I was kicked he hit my nuts too

3495
01:43:06,380 --> 01:43:07,910
Last year when I was kicked he hit my nuts too

3496
01:43:07,980 --> 01:43:12,080
That made it hurt ten-fold that of a normal Thai kick

3497
01:43:13,220 --> 01:43:17,220
I'm wondering if you're playing us,

3498
01:43:14,990 --> 01:43:17,220
so could you ACT as if you were kicked for us?

3499
01:43:17,220 --> 01:43:23,460
Act as if Thai kicked

3500
01:43:17,220 --> 01:43:23,460
Test of suspicion

3501
01:43:17,240 --> 01:43:21,440
That way we can compare to the Thai kick from before

3502
01:43:21,510 --> 01:43:24,960
What, what do you mean? A normal or super painful Thai kick?

3503
01:43:24,930 --> 01:43:30,630
What I really want

3504
01:43:26,000 --> 01:43:30,630
is to see Tanaka's performance of a really painful Thai kick

3505
01:43:29,030 --> 01:43:29,750
Doing it seriously?

3506
01:43:29,750 --> 01:43:30,400
In full seriousness

3507
01:43:31,770 --> 01:43:34,170
Don't hold back

3508
01:43:47,980 --> 01:43:48,890
Okay, cut!!

3509
01:43:48,890 --> 01:43:49,150
It's the same

3510
01:43:49,150 --> 01:43:51,720
It's the same

3511
01:43:52,810 --> 01:43:53,620
You really can do it!

3512
01:43:53,720 --> 01:43:54,810
That looked too good!

3513
01:43:55,130 --> 01:43:56,440
You really can do it, Tanaka!

3514
01:43:57,390 --> 01:44:03,030
It is possible that Tanaka faked his reaction

3515
01:43:59,550 --> 01:44:00,730
Incredible!

3516
01:44:03,270 --> 01:44:04,500
Let down!!

3517
01:44:04,500 --> 01:44:06,440
You're such a let down!!

3518
01:44:06,440 --> 01:44:09,170
That's actors for you

3519
01:44:06,440 --> 01:44:11,210
T/N: Tanaka has acted in quite a few dramas, movies, and even voice acted for anime. Has the most acting experience out of all the Gaki members.

3520
01:44:07,790 --> 01:44:09,760
No, it's not like that

3521
01:44:09,720 --> 01:44:10,940
Does that mean that today...

3522
01:44:11,210 --> 01:44:13,440
It's really hard to gauge a Thai Kick

3523
01:44:13,880 --> 01:44:15,300
Do it while wearing that!

3524
01:44:16,510 --> 01:44:21,450
Act out reaction while wearing joke mask

3525
01:44:18,080 --> 01:44:19,470
See how realistic you can do it

3526
01:44:21,890 --> 01:44:23,720
To see if the humor wins or if Tanaka's insanity wins

3527
01:44:23,720 --> 01:44:25,160
To see if the humor wins or if Tanaka's insanity wins

3528
01:44:25,960 --> 01:44:27,620
While also properly showing your face, okay?

3529
01:44:30,630 --> 01:44:32,060
ACTION!!

3530
01:44:40,800 --> 01:44:42,070
Nice stuff! Fantastic!!

3531
01:44:42,070 --> 01:44:44,470
Nice stuff! Fantastic!!

3532
01:44:44,470 --> 01:44:47,140
It makes no difference!!

3533
01:44:47,610 --> 01:44:48,660
No difference at all

3534
01:44:51,930 --> 01:44:53,780
No no, there must be a difference

3535
01:44:57,720 --> 01:44:59,660
That makes no sense

3536
01:44:58,620 --> 01:45:00,340
This is enlightening

3537
01:44:59,660 --> 01:45:01,260
I'm saying this makes no sense

3538
01:45:02,230 --> 01:45:03,880
Four and a half hours have passed

3539
01:45:02,780 --> 01:45:07,300
Four and a half hours into their school life

3540
01:45:04,560 --> 01:45:08,080
A special class has been
prepared for the 5 of them

3541
01:45:08,780 --> 01:45:09,730
You all okay?

3542
01:45:10,970 --> 01:45:11,500
We're gonna go to a special lecture now

3543
01:45:11,500 --> 01:45:14,000
We're gonna go to a special lecture now

3544
01:45:14,200 --> 01:45:17,340
We're going by bus

3545
01:45:17,370 --> 01:45:19,660
We have to take the bus to a lecture?

3546
01:45:20,040 --> 01:45:21,530
Eh, what can this be?

3547
01:45:24,110 --> 01:45:28,450
I get nothing but bad feelings

3548
01:45:25,180 --> 01:45:26,400
Yeah, me too

3549
01:45:29,020 --> 01:45:38,530
A harsh trial is awaiting the 5 of them

3550
01:45:29,020 --> 01:45:38,530
What is the special lecture?

3551
01:45:40,530 --> 01:45:45,670
And naturally the way there is also tough...

3552
01:45:47,640 --> 01:45:48,470
We're stopping?

3553
01:45:48,920 --> 01:45:50,220
At a place like this?

3554
01:45:54,580 --> 01:45:57,150
Arrival at bus stop

3555
01:46:00,820 --> 01:46:02,490
There it is!!

3556
01:46:01,380 --> 01:46:02,590
Oh! That is...

3557
01:46:03,400 --> 01:46:05,070
Perhaps... Is it them?

3558
01:46:05,570 --> 01:46:06,840
Oh no...

3559
01:46:07,720 --> 01:46:09,830
The yearly tradition of

3560
01:46:10,830 --> 01:46:13,000
They're really persistent...

3561
01:46:13,780 --> 01:46:17,770
The ones we look up to the most is Downtown

3562
01:46:15,880 --> 01:46:17,770
Downtown

3563
01:46:17,820 --> 01:46:21,570
By choosing the path of conflict with their manzai showdowns

3564
01:46:17,820 --> 01:46:21,570
T/N: "Manzai" is a stand-up comedy style that usually involves two performers. Downtown initially started their careers with manzai.

3565
01:46:21,620 --> 01:46:23,510
they've received two defeating blows

3566
01:46:23,560 --> 01:46:24,540
However

3567
01:46:24,590 --> 01:46:27,640
There is no turning back now

3568
01:46:27,730 --> 01:46:29,410
To make Downtown laugh

3569
01:46:29,460 --> 01:46:32,250
only one option remains

3570
01:46:32,420 --> 01:46:35,790
Introducing

3571
01:46:33,770 --> 01:46:35,790
Chidori Reborn

3572
01:46:38,270 --> 01:46:41,910
Hello everybody!

3573
01:46:40,160 --> 01:46:44,890
Going on 3 years, Chidori's manzai showdown

3574
01:46:42,090 --> 01:46:43,180
Nice to meet you

3575
01:46:43,090 --> 01:46:44,510
Nice to meet you

3576
01:46:44,060 --> 01:46:46,150
Humans really are the scariest

3577
01:46:46,150 --> 01:46:47,900
What do you mean by that?

3578
01:46:47,930 --> 01:46:49,680
There are so many disturbing incidents

3579
01:46:49,830 --> 01:46:51,840
Well yeah, there are a lot of those

3580
01:46:51,870 --> 01:46:55,640
Small kids that are walking around, just being kidnapped by strangers

3581
01:46:55,670 --> 01:47:00,090
Aah, kidnappings are terrifying! Taking small children...

3582
01:47:01,030 --> 01:47:02,100
Horrific stuff...

3583
01:47:01,040 --> 01:47:10,890
Stealing Downtown's Kidnapping manzai routine

3584
01:47:02,310 --> 01:47:03,510
And then you get a phone call

3585
01:47:03,560 --> 01:47:04,310
Right

3586
01:47:04,330 --> 01:47:05,620
Is that your...?

3587
01:47:05,630 --> 01:47:06,200
Hello

3588
01:47:06,380 --> 01:47:06,980
Hello?

3589
01:47:07,300 --> 01:47:09,570
You have a kid in second grade, right?

3590
01:47:09,620 --> 01:47:09,940
Yes!

3591
01:47:11,220 --> 01:47:12,520
I have a sixth grader at my house

3592
01:47:12,520 --> 01:47:13,720
What the hell?

3593
01:47:13,940 --> 01:47:15,630
Why would you tell me that?

3594
01:47:15,330 --> 01:47:18,680
It's a Downtown skit isn't it

3595
01:47:15,740 --> 01:47:17,430
So that I can scare you with this statement

3596
01:47:17,430 --> 01:47:18,730
Why would I be scared?

3597
01:47:18,730 --> 01:47:20,000
I would just accept the situation

3598
01:47:20,000 --> 01:47:21,050
Come on, scare me

3599
01:47:20,930 --> 01:47:21,600
Hello

3600
01:47:21,600 --> 01:47:22,370
Hello?

3601
01:47:22,370 --> 01:47:24,800
I've taken your son to my house

3602
01:47:24,800 --> 01:47:25,550
What?

3603
01:47:25,550 --> 01:47:26,740
He's at my house!

3604
01:47:26,740 --> 01:47:27,920
What? What do you mean?

3605
01:47:27,920 --> 01:47:29,640
No need to be surprised

3606
01:47:29,640 --> 01:47:30,910
You left him with me this morning

3607
01:47:30,910 --> 01:47:32,480
What the hell?

3608
01:47:32,480 --> 01:47:34,640
Why would you tell me that?

3609
01:47:34,640 --> 01:47:37,410
I'd just be like, "Oh okay" and that'd be it

3610
01:47:37,410 --> 01:47:38,480
Take this seriously

3611
01:47:38,100 --> 01:47:38,730
Hello?

3612
01:47:38,730 --> 01:47:39,430
Hello

3613
01:47:39,430 --> 01:47:40,670
Get the ransom ready

3614
01:47:40,670 --> 01:47:41,620
Ransom?

3615
01:47:41,950 --> 01:47:43,470
I'm Daigo and I'm located at the Second District

3616
01:47:43,100 --> 01:47:44,970
Why would you tell me your name?

3617
01:47:45,460 --> 01:47:47,510
You're in the Second District? Then you're right in my area!

3618
01:47:47,920 --> 01:47:49,990
Why wouldn't you say somewhere much further away?

3619
01:47:49,490 --> 01:47:50,240
Hello

3620
01:47:50,160 --> 01:47:50,840
Hello

3621
01:47:50,940 --> 01:47:52,460
Get the ransom ready

3622
01:47:52,460 --> 01:47:53,450
Ransom??

3623
01:47:53,050 --> 01:47:54,860
There's a phone booth in the Third District

3624
01:47:54,860 --> 01:47:55,530
A phone booth?

3625
01:47:55,530 --> 01:47:56,300
Oh, you know it?

3626
01:47:56,180 --> 01:47:56,770
I do

3627
01:47:56,770 --> 01:47:57,750
Take it there

3628
01:47:57,750 --> 01:47:58,350
Okay

3629
01:47:58,050 --> 01:47:59,990
When you come to deliver it

3630
01:47:59,800 --> 01:48:00,450
Yes

3631
01:48:00,190 --> 01:48:01,670
Follow my instructions

3632
01:48:00,350 --> 01:48:01,750
Now he's going to do it

3633
01:48:02,070 --> 01:48:04,260
A green bag with a white...

3634
01:48:04,260 --> 01:48:06,210
A green bag with a white paper...

3635
01:48:06,860 --> 01:48:07,760
With yellow

3636
01:48:06,860 --> 01:48:08,390
This is the punch line...

3637
01:48:08,340 --> 01:48:09,100
Green

3638
01:48:10,010 --> 01:48:12,230
A green bag with a white paper with yellow

3639
01:48:13,020 --> 01:48:14,730
With "yellow bag" written on it

3640
01:48:17,190 --> 01:48:18,990
What was that?

3641
01:48:18,990 --> 01:48:20,690
Are you listening?

3642
01:48:21,860 --> 01:48:25,660
It's been a really long time since I did this...

3643
01:48:23,530 --> 01:48:25,660
Even if you ask me, I don't know since it's so sudden

3644
01:48:25,660 --> 01:48:32,000
A green bag with a white paper with "yellow bag" written on it...

3645
01:48:26,030 --> 01:48:27,510
I didn't remember either!

3646
01:48:32,000 --> 01:48:37,570
"Blue bag" is what they should call it while going to get it...

3647
01:48:37,570 --> 01:48:39,080
It's a green bag though

3648
01:48:39,580 --> 01:48:42,150
Did I come up with that myself?

3649
01:48:41,060 --> 01:48:42,560
Ah, that's right

3650
01:48:42,150 --> 01:48:47,050
A green bag with white paper with "yellow bag" written

3651
01:48:47,050 --> 01:48:48,750
While calling it, "red bag"

3652
01:48:48,750 --> 01:48:50,620
If you can bring that, then...

3653
01:48:50,620 --> 01:48:54,020
I'll call it "black bag"  and come get it

3654
01:48:55,090 --> 01:48:57,030
A green bag with yellow...

3655
01:48:57,030 --> 01:48:59,310
A green bag with white paper with "yellow bag"...

3656
01:48:59,960 --> 01:49:03,730
written on it, while calling it "red bag," then I'll

3657
01:49:04,100 --> 01:49:06,300
come get it while calling it "black bag"

3658
01:49:06,370 --> 01:49:08,000
How am I supposed to remember that??

3659
01:49:08,000 --> 01:49:09,540
There's no way!

3660
01:49:09,660 --> 01:49:12,060
Isn't a blue bag okay?

3661
01:49:11,390 --> 01:49:13,430
Well then, bring a blue bag in an hour!

3662
01:49:14,260 --> 01:49:15,290
I understand

3663
01:49:15,290 --> 01:49:16,210
Wait a second

3664
01:49:16,210 --> 01:49:17,360
Huh, what?

3665
01:49:17,360 --> 01:49:18,330
What is it?

3666
01:49:19,270 --> 01:49:21,170
Don't be surprised when I say this, but...

3667
01:49:21,550 --> 01:49:23,990
Mom is nagging about my call being too long and I have to hang up

3668
01:49:23,990 --> 01:49:25,100
Please do hang up

3669
01:49:25,020 --> 01:49:27,420
Thank you very much

3670
01:49:25,020 --> 01:49:27,420
Thank you very much

3671
01:49:29,660 --> 01:49:34,060
No good. Nothing landed at all, did it?

3672
01:49:29,830 --> 01:49:30,430
What is this?

3673
01:49:34,060 --> 01:49:35,500
You skipped the whole damn joke!

3674
01:49:35,500 --> 01:49:39,200
Like I could remember

3675
01:49:36,570 --> 01:49:39,200
all that "bag bag bag" crap

3676
01:49:39,740 --> 01:49:42,470
What were you doing, asking Matsumoto?

3677
01:49:40,490 --> 01:49:41,520
We can totally hear you

3678
01:49:41,820 --> 01:49:44,010
That- Why- What? How would that make them laugh?

3679
01:49:44,010 --> 01:49:46,080
Would talking fast be funny?

3680
01:49:46,080 --> 01:49:48,880
Is that the kind era we live in?

3681
01:49:47,490 --> 01:49:50,500
There are lots of bags involved

3682
01:49:50,500 --> 01:49:52,430
So they aren't getting the joke

3683
01:49:52,080 --> 01:49:55,820
Why are lots of bags supposed to be funny?

3684
01:49:55,820 --> 01:50:00,390
An era where lots of types of bags

3685
01:49:58,050 --> 01:50:00,390
is funny is just unimaginable to me

3686
01:50:00,390 --> 01:50:01,720
There was a time!!

3687
01:50:01,720 --> 01:50:06,100
I'll do it, but we have to make it make sense to modern audiences!

3688
01:50:06,000 --> 01:50:08,930
Easy to understand is the goal!!

3689
01:50:07,350 --> 01:50:09,000
We can make it easier

3690
01:50:12,350 --> 01:50:14,440
Thank you, thank you

3691
01:50:15,150 --> 01:50:17,020
Hello, we're Chidori

3692
01:50:16,270 --> 01:50:17,640
Humans are the scariest, aren't they?

3693
01:50:17,740 --> 01:50:18,990
How so?

3694
01:50:18,240 --> 01:50:21,240
Yellow Bag

3695
01:50:18,660 --> 01:50:19,730
Disturbing incidents

3696
01:50:19,730 --> 01:50:21,080
Ah, that's true

3697
01:50:20,540 --> 01:50:23,300
Small kids that are walking around, just being kidnapped by strangers

3698
01:50:23,160 --> 01:50:26,370
Aah, kidnappings are terrifying! Taking small children...

3699
01:50:26,420 --> 01:50:27,030
Hello?

3700
01:50:27,030 --> 01:50:27,630
Hello?

3701
01:50:27,630 --> 01:50:28,630
Bring me the ransom money

3702
01:50:28,630 --> 01:50:29,700
What? Ransom money?

3703
01:50:29,700 --> 01:50:31,350
I'm Daigo and I'm located at the Second District

3704
01:50:31,350 --> 01:50:32,920
Why would you tell me your name!?

3705
01:50:33,260 --> 01:50:35,490
Aren't you going to demand a ransom?

3706
01:50:35,790 --> 01:50:37,140
Bring the ransom money

3707
01:50:37,140 --> 01:50:38,060
Ransom money?

3708
01:50:37,910 --> 01:50:39,560
There's a phone booth in the Third District

3709
01:50:39,610 --> 01:50:40,630
You know it?

3710
01:50:40,630 --> 01:50:44,120
When you get there, there's going to be people watching so do as I say

3711
01:50:43,480 --> 01:50:44,530
Do what you say?

3712
01:50:44,630 --> 01:50:49,810
Bring a green bag with a white paper with "yellow bag"  written on it

3713
01:50:51,070 --> 01:50:56,110
While calling it a "red bag," put it down and thuen

3714
01:50:56,150 --> 01:50:57,310
Hey

3715
01:50:57,510 --> 01:50:59,150
Put it down and then

3716
01:50:59,150 --> 01:51:02,520
I'll call it "black bag" and then I'll come and get it

3717
01:51:01,820 --> 01:51:02,750
Wait...

3718
01:51:02,570 --> 01:51:03,940
I'm confused...

3719
01:51:04,340 --> 01:51:07,340
Who would remember that? A blue bag should be fine

3720
01:51:07,890 --> 01:51:09,980
Well then bring a blue bag

3721
01:51:10,080 --> 01:51:11,160
I understand!

3722
01:51:10,340 --> 01:51:11,460
In an hour, got it?

3723
01:51:11,460 --> 01:51:12,060
Yes

3724
01:51:11,860 --> 01:51:13,680
Hang on

3725
01:51:12,660 --> 01:51:13,850
I don't get it

3726
01:51:14,210 --> 01:51:16,630
These guys piss me off

3727
01:51:16,730 --> 01:51:18,180
Hey, so

3728
01:51:18,300 --> 01:51:19,350
Don't be surprised when I say this, but...

3729
01:51:19,350 --> 01:51:20,290
What?

3730
01:51:20,290 --> 01:51:22,710
Mom is nagging about my call being too long and I have to hang up

3731
01:51:21,920 --> 01:51:22,920
These two...

3732
01:51:22,860 --> 01:51:23,720
Please do hang up

3733
01:51:23,770 --> 01:51:26,140
Thank you very much

3734
01:51:23,770 --> 01:51:26,140
Thank you very much

3735
01:51:26,140 --> 01:51:28,340
That was malicious

3736
01:51:27,180 --> 01:51:28,410
No good, right?

3737
01:51:29,910 --> 01:51:31,880
That didn't land at all!!

3738
01:51:30,710 --> 01:51:31,800
It didn't land!

3739
01:51:31,880 --> 01:51:32,520
Why?

3740
01:51:32,520 --> 01:51:35,180
They were too distracted by the bags

3741
01:51:35,180 --> 01:51:36,850
Distracted by the bags?

3742
01:51:36,850 --> 01:51:37,690
Can't help it!

3743
01:51:37,690 --> 01:51:41,120
It's a manzai with so many bags...

3744
01:51:41,120 --> 01:51:44,260
It's a bag manzai! It's not a kidnapping manzai!

3745
01:51:43,030 --> 01:51:44,280
Scary

3746
01:51:44,260 --> 01:51:46,400
You're wrong, dumbass

3747
01:51:45,810 --> 01:51:47,930
The tempo of the kidnapping stuff at the start is good

3748
01:51:47,930 --> 01:51:49,600
And then it just speeds up when

3749
01:51:49,600 --> 01:51:52,400
we get to the damn bags!!

3750
01:51:51,430 --> 01:51:52,940
So that means at that point,

3751
01:51:52,940 --> 01:51:56,310
it becomes a bag manzai!!

3752
01:51:54,750 --> 01:51:55,810
You're wrong, dumbass!

3753
01:51:56,470 --> 01:51:58,880
This is impossible for us

3754
01:51:58,880 --> 01:52:00,630
We can do something at this level

3755
01:52:00,910 --> 01:52:04,010
Lots of colored bags kind of manzai is just impossible for us

3756
01:52:04,930 --> 01:52:07,450
Let's just go ask the original creators

3757
01:52:05,160 --> 01:52:07,230
Would you cut it out already?

3758
01:52:08,030 --> 01:52:10,290
Let's ask the original creators!!

3759
01:52:09,700 --> 01:52:10,390
What do you mean?

3760
01:52:10,290 --> 01:52:11,990
If we can't get the original guys to do it, it won't work

3761
01:52:12,660 --> 01:52:14,720
What are they saying, those two?

3762
01:52:13,470 --> 01:52:14,840
Let's try asking

3763
01:52:14,840 --> 01:52:17,390
We can't cross into the new year without this

3764
01:52:17,730 --> 01:52:18,860
Asking the original creators?

3765
01:52:19,160 --> 01:52:19,960
Excuse us

3766
01:52:19,960 --> 01:52:21,600
Sorry about that

3767
01:52:21,530 --> 01:52:22,370
For everything

3768
01:52:23,770 --> 01:52:25,800
We couldn't do it

3769
01:52:25,800 --> 01:52:26,970
It was great!

3770
01:52:27,600 --> 01:52:29,670
We didn't think it would be that hard...

3771
01:52:30,470 --> 01:52:33,240
It isn't hard!

3772
01:52:33,680 --> 01:52:36,950
It's a pretty old joke, so...

3773
01:52:37,000 --> 01:52:38,130
Daigo has a bit of a proposal...

3774
01:52:39,880 --> 01:52:43,390
If it's okay with you, could you, uh, that bag manzai...

3775
01:52:43,390 --> 01:52:46,460
It's not a bag manzai

3776
01:52:45,000 --> 01:52:46,710
Shouldn't you stop calling it a bag manzai?

3777
01:52:46,460 --> 01:52:50,560
Would you two do that kidnapping manzai?

3778
01:52:50,160 --> 01:52:51,230
Wait, really?

3779
01:52:50,560 --> 01:52:55,230
They want to see the original kidnapping joke

3780
01:52:50,890 --> 01:52:52,800
No way...

3781
01:52:51,960 --> 01:52:52,700
Will you?

3782
01:52:52,930 --> 01:52:55,570
We haven't done this for a long time, we really haven't

3783
01:52:55,100 --> 01:52:56,780
That's true, but really...

3784
01:52:55,230 --> 01:52:56,520
Yes, understandable

3785
01:52:57,170 --> 01:53:00,940
Even when watching you two do it I was like, did we say it that way?

3786
01:52:58,990 --> 01:53:00,650
Ah, yeah, yeah

3787
01:53:00,170 --> 01:53:01,650
So,

3788
01:53:01,900 --> 01:53:06,310
We've prepared cue cards

3789
01:53:03,460 --> 01:53:04,260
Cue cards?

3790
01:53:05,990 --> 01:53:07,730
Sorry, this is really...

3791
01:53:07,310 --> 01:53:09,880
This is absurd!!

3792
01:53:08,360 --> 01:53:09,680
Yes, we know it's absurd...

3793
01:53:08,580 --> 01:53:09,960
Wow, amazing

3794
01:53:09,910 --> 01:53:11,710
This is a decades-old joke

3795
01:53:10,910 --> 01:53:13,420
What does he mean by cue cards?

3796
01:53:13,730 --> 01:53:14,570
Excuse me

3797
01:53:14,770 --> 01:53:15,590
Now, okay...

3798
01:53:16,350 --> 01:53:19,320
Stop it with "Okay"

3799
01:53:17,050 --> 01:53:18,270
Wait, seriously?

3800
01:53:18,920 --> 01:53:19,820
Start from outside

3801
01:53:19,320 --> 01:53:21,520
Really?

3802
01:53:20,010 --> 01:53:21,340
Yes, really, sorry

3803
01:53:22,090 --> 01:53:24,090
Thank you

3804
01:53:22,790 --> 01:53:23,880
What the heck?

3805
01:53:25,260 --> 01:53:28,760
This is really an old joke

3806
01:53:27,860 --> 01:53:28,930
Yeah, really

3807
01:53:28,800 --> 01:53:30,480
Yes, this is really quite the occasion...

3808
01:53:30,480 --> 01:53:31,300
Really

3809
01:53:31,300 --> 01:53:35,140
You can't see it live

3810
01:53:32,150 --> 01:53:33,600
Definitely

3811
01:53:33,440 --> 01:53:34,900
That's the truth

3812
01:53:35,140 --> 01:53:37,340
Would it be better if they maintained the original energy?

3813
01:53:36,510 --> 01:53:37,790
Yeah

3814
01:53:37,960 --> 01:53:39,240
If they're going to do it, then I'd say so

3815
01:53:39,310 --> 01:53:42,510
Please do it with your original energy

3816
01:53:42,510 --> 01:53:43,660
All righty

3817
01:53:43,210 --> 01:53:45,650
Are they practicing the joke?

3818
01:53:43,680 --> 01:53:45,060
Ehhh?

3819
01:53:44,380 --> 01:53:45,600
Are they?

3820
01:53:44,960 --> 01:53:45,600
Are they?

3821
01:53:45,650 --> 01:53:48,920
They're not

3822
01:53:46,230 --> 01:53:48,120
Oh, they're not

3823
01:53:48,920 --> 01:53:55,890
The first Downtown manzai in about 30 years

3824
01:53:49,090 --> 01:53:51,250
Okay, Downtown, please!

3825
01:53:54,520 --> 01:53:55,930
Please go ahead!

3826
01:53:56,080 --> 01:55:35,760
Downtown

3827
01:53:56,080 --> 01:55:35,760
First manzai in ~30 years

3828
01:53:57,640 --> 01:53:58,240
Thank you

3829
01:53:58,810 --> 01:54:01,060
Well, well, recently, there have been those

3830
01:54:01,060 --> 01:54:03,750
kidnappings and such

3831
01:54:03,750 --> 01:54:08,170
of small children, taking them away and other disturbing and messed up things

3832
01:54:06,750 --> 01:54:09,270
Yeah, really messed up

3833
01:54:09,970 --> 01:54:10,570
Hello?

3834
01:54:12,280 --> 01:54:13,130
Hello?

3835
01:54:13,680 --> 01:54:16,450
Yeah, you've got a...

3836
01:54:16,930 --> 01:54:18,480
A son in 2nd grade right?

3837
01:54:18,480 --> 01:54:19,420
Yes, I do

3838
01:54:19,420 --> 01:54:21,120
I've got the 6th grader here

3839
01:54:21,120 --> 01:54:22,270
Oh, really?

3840
01:54:22,270 --> 01:54:23,900
No, not "Oh, really?"

3841
01:54:24,020 --> 01:54:26,720
Hamada, stay sharp please

3842
01:54:26,120 --> 01:54:27,210
The hell are you saying?

3843
01:54:26,720 --> 01:54:29,090
It's supposed to be, "What the hell?"

3844
01:54:29,090 --> 01:54:30,090
It's "What the hell?"

3845
01:54:30,110 --> 01:54:31,140
What the hell?

3846
01:54:32,400 --> 01:54:34,510
So that I can scare you with this statement

3847
01:54:34,510 --> 01:54:35,980
Why would I be scared?

3848
01:54:36,370 --> 01:54:37,680
Ah, hello?

3849
01:54:37,680 --> 01:54:38,200
Yes

3850
01:54:38,230 --> 01:54:39,500
Your son

3851
01:54:39,500 --> 01:54:39,790
Yeah

3852
01:54:39,790 --> 01:54:41,340
I have him at my place

3853
01:54:40,640 --> 01:54:41,340
Huh!?

3854
01:54:41,340 --> 01:54:43,960
Why are you saying, "Huh!?"
You left him with me this morning

3855
01:54:43,960 --> 01:54:45,610
Oh really?

3856
01:54:44,520 --> 01:54:46,280
No, not "Oh, really?"

3857
01:54:47,040 --> 01:54:50,650
Hamada, it's "What the hell?"

3858
01:54:49,280 --> 01:54:50,510
What the hell?

3859
01:54:50,060 --> 01:54:53,970
T/N: In manzai, one comedian is the "boke" or "funny man" and the other is the "tsukkomi" or "straight man". It usually goes in the pattern of the funny man saying something dumb and the straight man retorting and pointing it out.

3860
01:54:50,650 --> 01:54:52,750
Somehow it turned into funny man,
straight man, straight man

3861
01:54:51,260 --> 01:54:52,750
What the hell...

3862
01:54:53,970 --> 01:54:54,530
Hello

3863
01:54:54,530 --> 01:54:54,980
Yes

3864
01:54:55,150 --> 01:54:56,750
Bring the ransom money

3865
01:54:56,750 --> 01:54:57,850
Ransom money?

3866
01:54:57,520 --> 01:55:01,590
I'm Matsumoto from the Second District, so bring the ransom money there

3867
01:55:01,020 --> 01:55:02,980
Why would you tell me your name?

3868
01:55:04,260 --> 01:55:06,700
Hmm, something's not quite right?

3869
01:55:06,700 --> 01:55:08,800
This guy isn't even trying

3870
01:55:09,180 --> 01:55:11,430
He's getting a little rusty, come on, try a little

3871
01:55:11,430 --> 01:55:13,300
He's using a weird accent too

3872
01:55:11,430 --> 01:55:13,300
T/N: If you're unfamiliar with Downtown's manzais, Hamada was known to be a very aggressive tsukkomi. He's gotten really soft over the years so his tsukkomi is lacking now.

3873
01:55:13,900 --> 01:55:15,350
Yeah, try a little

3874
01:55:14,590 --> 01:55:15,920
I'm gonna be let down you know

3875
01:55:16,670 --> 01:55:18,420
Why would you tell me your name?!

3876
01:55:17,920 --> 01:55:18,590
Right

3877
01:55:18,510 --> 01:55:19,880
Also, don't tell me your location!

3878
01:55:20,990 --> 01:55:21,780
Hello

3879
01:55:21,780 --> 01:55:23,330
Yes, hello

3880
01:55:23,330 --> 01:55:25,130
There's a phone booth in the Third District,
know it?

3881
01:55:25,130 --> 01:55:26,230
Yes, I know it

3882
01:55:26,230 --> 01:55:30,900
There're going to be people watching
so do as I say...

3883
01:55:31,720 --> 01:55:33,010
Just gotta go for it

3884
01:55:32,090 --> 01:55:33,540
Hold up

3885
01:55:33,590 --> 01:55:35,760
It was getting to the good part too... So loud

3886
01:55:35,760 --> 01:55:42,330
Can't hear the bag part due to rude bikers

3887
01:55:36,580 --> 01:55:40,300
On a green bag, on a white piece of paper

3888
01:55:40,760 --> 01:55:42,130
This is the part I wanted to hear

3889
01:55:42,330 --> 01:55:44,030
That's really loud!!

3890
01:55:42,330 --> 01:56:05,620
Downtown

3891
01:55:42,330 --> 01:56:05,620
First manzai in ~30 years

3892
01:55:43,680 --> 01:55:44,780
What will he do with the bag?

3893
01:55:45,370 --> 01:55:48,600
On a white paper, on a green bag,
on a white paper

3894
01:55:49,390 --> 01:55:50,610
I really want to hear this

3895
01:55:49,910 --> 01:55:51,910
This is the one part I want to hear

3896
01:55:51,710 --> 01:55:52,790
Seriously?

3897
01:55:54,580 --> 01:55:55,580
Why's it gotta be like this...

3898
01:55:55,080 --> 01:55:58,360
If you say "blue bag" while putting it there, while saying "green bag" I'll...

3899
01:55:59,550 --> 01:56:01,430
That was the part I wanted to hear the most

3900
01:56:01,650 --> 01:56:03,890
That was really loud!!

3901
01:56:06,560 --> 01:56:08,590
I wanted to hear that the most

3902
01:56:07,660 --> 01:56:08,640
Excuse us

3903
01:56:08,160 --> 01:56:09,290
That's no good

3904
01:56:11,040 --> 01:56:11,690
What?

3905
01:56:12,630 --> 01:56:16,200
T/N: Ibaraki prefecture is known for their flashy motorcycle culture.

3906
01:56:12,630 --> 01:56:16,200
That's the local Ibaraki culture...

3907
01:56:17,580 --> 01:56:19,240
Yeah, that kind of delinquent

3908
01:56:22,440 --> 01:56:25,370
Hamada you've got to do it proper, really

3909
01:56:25,390 --> 01:56:27,380
"Do it proper," yeah, right!

3910
01:56:28,340 --> 01:56:33,380
We haven't practiced even, how many years has it been?

3911
01:56:31,900 --> 01:56:33,720
He's been doing quite well considering

3912
01:56:33,320 --> 01:56:35,350
Hey now that you think about it, see?

3913
01:56:35,350 --> 01:56:39,260
It's a different era now so the type of responses are different

3914
01:56:39,260 --> 01:56:42,120
We're leaving

3915
01:56:43,890 --> 01:56:45,160
What?

3916
01:56:46,000 --> 01:56:47,350
That makes me mad

3917
01:56:47,180 --> 01:56:48,610
Suddenly going home

3918
01:56:47,700 --> 01:56:48,710
So glad we got to see that

3919
01:56:48,730 --> 01:56:50,400
We learned a lot

3920
01:56:51,130 --> 01:56:54,140
You guys are terrible!

3921
01:56:53,520 --> 01:56:54,500
Excuse us, thank you

3922
01:56:54,140 --> 01:56:57,010
You're really messed up

3923
01:56:57,010 --> 01:57:00,280
It's as if they tore off our underwear and then up and left

3924
01:56:57,290 --> 01:56:58,690
He just launched into it

3925
01:57:00,440 --> 01:57:08,250
The 5 can't even take a break

3926
01:57:00,440 --> 01:57:08,250
The bus goes to the next laugh assassin's base

3927
01:57:01,340 --> 01:57:03,630
The 5 guys aren't taking a break

3928
01:57:04,310 --> 01:57:07,180
The bus goes to the next assassin's base

3929
01:57:12,120 --> 01:57:14,890
Arrival at bus stop

3930
01:57:13,160 --> 01:57:14,120
Ok...

3931
01:57:15,990 --> 01:57:22,520
Actresses with a new and novel skit script!

3932
01:57:18,510 --> 01:57:22,520

01:57:35,380 --> 01:57:36,730
Police officers, there's trouble!

3936
01:57:35,380 --> 01:57:42,850

My best friend Ashina's underwear has been stolen!

3939
01:57:40,120 --> 01:57:41,750
Catch the person who did this,

3940
01:57:41,750 --> 01:57:42,850
and punish them!

3941
01:57:43,120 --> 01:57:49,860
Hirose!

3942
01:57:44,750 --> 01:57:49,860
Hirose! a girl

3943
01:57:45,920 --> 01:57:49,860
shouldn't use such

3944
01:57:47,560 --> 01:57:47,670
dirty words!!

3945
01:57:47,670 --> 01:57:49,860
dirty words!!

3946
01:57:49,860 --> 01:57:51,760
I mean, it's Ashina's underwear and all...

3947
01:57:51,760 --> 01:57:56,180

01:57:55,010 --> 01:57:56,050
You're right...

3951
01:57:56,400 --> 01:57:59,100
Officers, to catch the criminal, what should Ashina do?

3952
01:57:59,100 --> 01:58:01,470
Officers, to catch the criminal, what should Ashina do?

3953
01:58:01,470 --> 01:58:02,760
Eh?!

3954
01:58:01,470 --> 01:58:02,760
Eh?!

3955
01:58:02,770 --> 01:58:04,440
First, explain in detail what kind of underwear was stolen, you say?

3956
01:58:04,440 --> 01:58:07,210
First, explain in detail what kind of underwear was stolen, you say?

3957
01:58:07,210 --> 01:58:08,860
Apologize!

3958
01:58:08,860 --> 01:58:10,450
Apologize to Ashina right now!!

3959
01:58:12,080 --> 01:58:14,280
Is this your

3960
01:58:14,320 --> 01:58:14,670
WAY OF DOING THINGS?!

3961
01:58:14,670 --> 01:58:15,450
WAY OF DOING THINGS?!

3962
01:58:15,450 --> 01:58:17,090
WAY OF DOING THINGS?!

3963
01:58:21,160 --> 01:58:23,460
What?

3964
01:58:23,460 --> 01:58:26,560
They didn't laugh at all

3965
01:58:26,560 --> 01:58:28,760
Failing a skit on a New Years Eve program, isn't that serious?

3966
01:58:28,760 --> 01:58:30,470
Failing a skit on a New Years Eve program, isn't that serious?

3967
01:58:30,470 --> 01:58:32,130
Failing a skit on a New Years Eve program, isn't that serious?

3968
01:58:32,130 --> 01:58:33,140
Because...

3969
01:58:33,140 --> 01:58:34,800
That blonde guy, right in the middle of the skit

3970
01:58:34,800 --> 01:58:38,210
That blonde guy, right in the middle of the skit

3971
01:58:35,800 --> 01:58:38,210
he kept on looking at me with such lewd eyes

3972
01:58:36,870 --> 01:58:38,210
Was not!

3973
01:58:38,210 --> 01:58:39,440
I know, right?

3974
01:58:40,110 --> 01:58:41,310
I was wondering, what is this?

3975
01:58:42,310 --> 01:58:44,450
I bet he's gone crazy from so much muscle training...

3976
01:58:44,450 --> 01:58:44,560
It's gross!!

3977
01:58:44,560 --> 01:58:47,020
It's gross!!

3978
01:58:47,020 --> 01:58:47,880
This guy, when he went to Hawaii with some of his juniors,

3979
01:58:47,880 --> 01:58:49,420
This guy, when he went to Hawaii with some of his juniors,

3980
01:58:49,420 --> 01:58:52,620
He made his juniors take photos

3981
01:58:50,790 --> 01:58:52,620
of his muscles that he wanted to upload onto Twitter

3982
01:58:52,620 --> 01:58:54,920
And he just wasn't satisfied with them

3983
01:58:55,690 --> 01:58:57,660
By the way, these are the photos that were taken...

3984
01:58:59,160 --> 01:59:02,280
Just how many did you make them take!!

3985
01:59:03,200 --> 01:59:05,700
You're taking a lot of photos, aren't you?

3986
01:59:04,770 --> 01:59:05,700
No, that's wrong

3987
01:59:07,140 --> 01:59:10,870
You're taking a lot of photos there

3988
01:59:10,870 --> 01:59:12,940
It just happened like that

3989
01:59:15,610 --> 01:59:19,180
If you're an entertainer you shouldn't be doing muscle training,

3990
01:59:17,280 --> 01:59:19,180
you should be training your comedy routine!!

3991
01:59:23,220 --> 01:59:27,260

Bringing you a lovely song, I am the Sing-Along Guy!!

3997
01:59:32,700 --> 01:59:33,750
Hey, you two

3998
01:59:34,500 --> 01:59:38,170
It sounded like you were having a quarrel,

3999
01:59:36,830 --> 01:59:38,170
about that entertainer who has too much muscle

4000
01:59:38,430 --> 01:59:39,440
With the muscle training, there's a proper reason for it

4001
01:59:39,440 --> 01:59:41,100
With the muscle training, there's a proper reason for it

4002
01:59:41,100 --> 01:59:43,340
If we sing this song, I'm sure you'll understand

4003
01:59:43,340 --> 01:59:44,510
Music start!!

4004
01:59:52,280 --> 01:59:55,990
We're all grossed out~

4005
01:59:56,050 --> 01:59:57,900
Hitoshi's body really grosses us out

4006
01:59:57,900 --> 01:59:59,720
Hitoshi's body really grosses us out

4007
01:59:59,810 --> 02:00:03,490
Where did your charisma that made people laugh go?

4008
02:00:03,860 --> 02:00:07,600
The only one here is a pro wrestler

4009
02:00:08,000 --> 02:00:11,670
What even is your goal? If we look into it,

4010
02:00:11,670 --> 02:00:14,870
What even is your goal? If we look into it,

4011
02:00:15,620 --> 02:00:19,590
The cringey reason is it's for your daughter's sake

4012
02:00:19,590 --> 02:00:22,440
The cringey reason is it's for your daughter's sake

4013

T/N: Mandy is a dancer and member of the Japanese pop group, EXILE.

4019
02:00:31,190 --> 02:00:33,110
Everyone everyone is training

4020
02:00:33,110 --> 02:00:34,720
Everyone everyone is training

4021
02:00:34,720 --> 02:00:38,760
Because you all want to be popular

4022
02:00:53,410 --> 02:00:54,910
That was messed up...

4023
02:00:57,050 --> 02:00:59,180
Should we try the joke one more time?

4024
02:00:59,180 --> 02:01:02,050
I can't

4025
02:01:02,600 --> 02:01:04,890
That guy there (Hamada)

4026
02:01:04,890 --> 02:01:08,620
He had his mouth wide open the whole time just spacing out

4027
02:01:07,260 --> 02:01:08,620
That's not true

4028
02:01:08,620 --> 02:01:09,630
I was not

4029
02:01:09,630 --> 02:01:10,630
He was completely spaced out

4030
02:01:10,630 --> 02:01:11,990
He was completely spaced out

4031
02:01:12,310 --> 02:01:14,910
That's right, that's right, I remember now. This person...

4032
02:01:14,930 --> 02:01:17,230
When he went and ate with his juniors,

4033
02:01:18,170 --> 02:01:20,140
Wanting to look cool to them,

4034
02:01:20,140 --> 02:01:20,770
Said "See ya, thanks for coming out, later!!"

4035
02:01:20,770 --> 02:01:21,240
Said "See ya, thanks for coming out, later!!"

4036
02:01:21,240 --> 02:01:23,010
Said "See ya, thanks for coming out, later!!"

4037
02:01:23,010 --> 02:01:26,140
And as he dashed into a car,

4038
02:01:26,140 --> 02:01:29,880
Apparently it was a complete stranger's car

4039
02:01:29,880 --> 02:01:31,280
And apparently that happened a bunch of times, too

4040
02:01:30,300 --> 02:01:31,850
Surely that's not right?

4041
02:01:31,850 --> 02:01:34,330
Isn't it crazy how senile he is?

4042
02:01:34,330 --> 02:01:35,080
And as well,

4043
02:01:35,080 --> 02:01:36,200
The other three are only mid level entertainers

4044
02:01:36,200 --> 02:01:37,390
The other three are only mid level entertainers

4045
02:01:37,390 --> 02:01:40,390
Normally you just read between the lines and laugh right?

4046
02:01:39,140 --> 02:01:40,390
Right?

4047
02:01:40,390 --> 02:01:42,660
But do you you know him? Hosei

4048
02:01:42,660 --> 02:01:46,830
Apparently he really likes

4049
02:01:44,830 --> 02:01:46,830
the sweet potato they bring for the recording of Osaka Honwaka TV

4050
02:01:46,830 --> 02:01:48,330
After the recording,

4051
02:01:48,330 --> 02:01:50,770
Apparently, he gathered up all the leftover

4052
02:01:48,330 --> 02:01:50,770
sweet potatoes from the dressing room

4053
02:01:50,770 --> 02:01:53,240
That the other entertainers left behind and took it home himself

4054
02:01:53,770 --> 02:01:54,700
Really?

4055
02:01:53,770 --> 02:01:56,540
What a stunningly filthy entertainer

4056
02:01:54,950 --> 02:01:56,540
That's sad...

4057
02:01:57,540 --> 02:01:58,870
This guy...

4058
02:01:58,870 --> 02:02:00,340
For more than 5 years,

4059
02:02:00,340 --> 02:02:02,810
He was a commentator on an Osaka news program

4060
02:02:02,810 --> 02:02:03,980
But his comments were so stupid, he was fired recently

4061
02:02:03,980 --> 02:02:05,730
But his comments were so stupid, he was fired recently

4062
02:02:05,730 --> 02:02:06,680
And then, apparently feeling a sense of danger,

4063
02:02:06,680 --> 02:02:09,550
And then, apparently feeling a sense of danger,

4064
02:02:09,550 --> 02:02:10,120
Suddenly,

4065
02:02:10,120 --> 02:02:12,860
Said he wanted to become a "committed dad" entertainer

4066
02:02:12,860 --> 02:02:15,320
He approached the producer for the show, "My First Errand"

4067
02:02:12,860 --> 02:02:15,320
T/N: "My First Errand" is a show that sends young kids out to run an errand for their parents. Though they are filmed and supervised, the kids are unaware and are mostly on their own.

4068
02:02:15,320 --> 02:02:18,510
And was in direct talks about appearing

4069
02:02:18,780 --> 02:02:21,400
He just happened to be there... We just talked...

4070
02:02:21,400 --> 02:02:22,160
We just talked

4071
02:02:22,870 --> 02:02:24,300
And Tanaka...

4072
02:02:24,300 --> 02:02:27,970
Apparently a friend of his kid in middle school

4073
02:02:26,030 --> 02:02:27,970
came and had a sleepover at his house

4074
02:02:27,970 --> 02:02:29,620
And when the kid's friend woke up the next day, this guy

4075
02:02:29,620 --> 02:02:30,610
And when the kid's friend woke up the next day, this guy

4076
02:02:30,610 --> 02:02:31,510
He had ironed his friend's uniform

4077
02:02:31,510 --> 02:02:33,040
He had ironed his friend's uniform

4078
02:02:33,040 --> 02:02:36,010
It sounds like the friend got creeped out from that

4079
02:02:36,010 --> 02:02:38,410
I do it for everyone... Everyone...

4080
02:02:39,030 --> 02:02:40,780
You're so kind!!

4081
02:02:41,780 --> 02:02:44,350
I just did it for everyone... Because I was doing mine as well

4082
02:02:44,350 --> 02:02:47,620
I just did it for everyone... Because I was doing mine as well

4083
02:02:45,920 --> 02:02:47,620
What's with that, what's up with that?

4084
02:02:47,620 --> 02:02:49,420
Everyone's was there...

4085
02:02:48,360 --> 02:02:49,420
But...

4086
02:02:49,420 --> 02:02:50,360
That's more than dirty, it's terrifying

4087
02:02:50,360 --> 02:02:52,210
That's more than dirty, it's terrifying

4088
02:02:51,360 --> 02:02:52,210
pIt's gross

4089
02:02:57,270 --> 02:03:00,040
Okay okay, that's enough for now

4090
02:02:58,700 --> 02:03:04,470
Kobayashi Yoshihisa

4091
02:02:58,700 --> 02:03:04,470
Sing Along Guy

4092
02:03:00,740 --> 02:03:04,470
You two have been saying, "you're dirty, you're dirty" about those three

4093
02:03:04,670 --> 02:03:05,860
But with entertainers,

4094
02:03:06,140 --> 02:03:09,190
They do fine work from being
dirty and getting laughs from it

4095
02:03:09,750 --> 02:03:11,480
Music Start!!

4096
02:03:17,570 --> 02:03:21,390
The sun will come out tomorrow

4097
02:03:21,390 --> 02:03:26,310
Bet your bottom dollar that good things happen tomorrow! However...

4098
02:03:26,310 --> 02:03:28,830
Bet your bottom dollar that good things happen tomorrow! However...

4099
02:03:29,010 --> 02:03:32,100
A muscle training addict, Hitoshi

4100
02:03:32,100 --> 02:03:33,340
A muscle training addict, Hitoshi

4101
02:03:33,370 --> 02:03:38,220
A man that forgets what he eats, Hamada

4102
02:03:38,220 --> 02:03:40,940
A man that forgets what he eats, Hamada

4103
02:03:41,010 --> 02:03:42,140
Post divorce depression, Tanaka

4104
02:03:42,140 --> 02:03:46,620
Post divorce depression, Tanaka

4105
02:03:46,620 --> 02:03:47,780
Hoping for a job as a committed dad, Endo

4106
02:03:47,780 --> 02:03:53,120
Hoping for a job as a committed dad, Endo

4107
02:03:53,120 --> 02:03:55,790
Hoping for a job as a committed dad, Endo

4108
02:03:55,840 --> 02:03:57,840
Rakugo life, Hosei

4109
02:03:57,840 --> 02:03:59,210
Rakugo life, Hosei

4110
02:03:59,240 --> 02:04:01,680
The amount of laughs decreases as time goes on

4111
02:04:01,680 --> 02:04:03,620
The amount of laughs decreases as time goes on

4112
02:04:03,620 --> 02:04:06,550
The amount of laughs decreases as time goes on

4113
02:04:06,890 --> 02:04:08,140
Gaki no Tsukai

4114
02:04:08,140 --> 02:04:09,720
Gaki no Tsukai

4115
02:04:09,770 --> 02:04:10,990
You're all dirty! We're worried about tomorrow

4116
02:04:10,990 --> 02:04:12,540
You're all dirty! We're worried about tomorrow

4117
02:04:12,540 --> 02:04:13,490
You're all dirty! We're worried about tomorrow

4118
02:04:13,490 --> 02:04:20,780
You're all dirty! We're worried about tomorrow

4119
02:04:27,020 --> 02:04:28,340
That's just mean

4120
02:04:29,120 --> 02:04:30,990
You're all dirty and you're all out

4121
02:04:38,100 --> 02:04:38,700
Oi...

4122
02:04:39,130 --> 02:04:41,140
I tell them to not leave the photos behind...

4123
02:04:45,160 --> 02:04:47,160
Yeah...

4124
02:04:45,590 --> 02:04:47,160
Yeah...

4125
02:04:47,210 --> 02:04:48,410
We're all in this together, right

4126
02:04:48,410 --> 02:04:49,610
It's a good story, though

4127
02:04:49,710 --> 02:04:50,210
Accidentally

4128
02:04:50,210 --> 02:04:52,750
It's a good story, but

4129
02:04:50,860 --> 02:04:52,460
Well yeah it's good, but..

4130
02:04:52,760 --> 02:04:56,050
I don't quite understand

4131
02:04:54,250 --> 02:04:56,050
what category it belongs in

4132
02:04:56,270 --> 02:05:02,790
However, there is one more person they won't let off just yet...

4133
02:05:04,990 --> 02:05:08,360
You entered the wrong car?

4134
02:05:08,360 --> 02:05:13,340
Well, the car looked exactly like mine

4135
02:05:13,640 --> 02:05:17,940
And of course, I leave the restaurant and the car's there.

4136
02:05:15,340 --> 02:05:17,940
So I thought it was mine

4137
02:05:17,940 --> 02:05:19,570
You can't just assume that

4138
02:05:19,570 --> 02:05:21,410
How did you notice it wasn't your car?

4139
02:05:21,410 --> 02:05:24,350
Did you get seated before you noticed?

4140
02:05:24,550 --> 02:05:27,850
I opened the sliding door in the back

4141
02:05:27,850 --> 02:05:32,050
And as soon as I did the driver went "Wrong wrong!!"

4142
02:05:32,820 --> 02:05:38,360
"Wrong wrong!!"

4143
02:05:35,510 --> 02:05:36,490
He said "Wrong wrong"?

4144
02:05:40,530 --> 02:05:41,410
"Wrong wrong"!!

4145
02:05:40,850 --> 02:05:41,950
He just went "Wrong wrong!!"?

4146
02:05:43,370 --> 02:05:44,230
"Wrong wrong"

4147
02:05:43,800 --> 02:05:45,230
"Oh it's Hama-chan!" He didn't say anything like that?

4148
02:05:45,230 --> 02:05:47,700
That sounds like you did the same thing the day before yesterday

4149
02:05:49,810 --> 02:05:52,640
You made him pretty irritated!!

4150
02:05:52,640 --> 02:05:55,310
That's an amazing reaction for being the first time

4151
02:05:55,740 --> 02:05:58,180
The driver must have been quite scared too

4152
02:05:58,710 --> 02:06:07,090
The place of the special class is within view!!

4153
02:06:10,880 --> 02:06:12,510
That's it, right? The special class

4154
02:06:12,710 --> 02:06:13,110
Huh?

4155
02:06:21,740 --> 02:06:22,940
What?

4156
02:06:22,940 --> 02:06:23,440
EH?  EH?!  EH?

4157
02:06:23,440 --> 02:06:24,310
EH?  EH?!  EH?

4158
02:06:23,790 --> 02:06:26,270
Hey... What is this...?

4159
02:06:24,310 --> 02:06:26,740
EH?  EH?!  EH?

4160
02:06:26,740 --> 02:06:32,780
A mysterious ensemble approaches

4161
02:06:27,190 --> 02:06:28,210
Someone's coming!

4162
02:06:28,210 --> 02:06:30,230
Who is that!?

4163
02:06:34,120 --> 02:06:36,400
Oy! You!

4164
02:06:36,590 --> 02:06:37,670
Scary!

4165
02:06:37,670 --> 02:06:39,290
Get off this bus right now!

4166
02:06:37,920 --> 02:06:41,620
General

4167
02:06:37,920 --> 02:06:41,620
Kendo Kobayashi

4168
02:06:41,620 --> 02:06:45,330
If you don't this little thing will blow your brains out

4169
02:06:45,330 --> 02:06:48,330
GET OFF!!

4170
02:06:47,450 --> 02:06:48,310
Take them away

4171
02:06:48,760 --> 02:06:51,950
So this is how they introduced the black figures

4172
02:06:49,330 --> 02:06:51,370
The hell? This is bad

4173
02:06:52,080 --> 02:06:53,240
That is that guy, right?

4174
02:06:53,400 --> 02:06:55,740
STOP YOUR BLABBERING!!

4175
02:06:55,740 --> 02:06:58,570
WOAH!! That's a loud voice!

4176
02:06:58,570 --> 02:06:59,980
Stop complaining

4177
02:06:59,980 --> 02:07:01,640
Ah, that time it barely came out

4178
02:07:01,640 --> 02:07:03,410
So he has a gentle side

4179
02:07:04,180 --> 02:07:06,250
This guy is always so mad

4180
02:07:06,980 --> 02:07:08,250
He's also really rude

4181
02:07:08,920 --> 02:07:10,890
CLIMB THE STAIRS!!

4182
02:07:11,620 --> 02:07:14,790
Such a loud voice

4183
02:07:13,360 --> 02:07:14,310
No one would defy him

4184
02:07:14,790 --> 02:07:20,530
A small step

4185
02:07:15,070 --> 02:07:16,320
He should say something about this step

4186
02:07:16,160 --> 02:07:18,830
Oy, watch out for this step

4187
02:07:17,340 --> 02:07:18,690
Ah, he did

4188
02:07:18,830 --> 02:07:20,530
He really can be gentle

4189
02:07:21,100 --> 02:07:23,480
His bad guy good guy shtick is all over the place

4190
02:07:26,100 --> 02:07:30,840
You have 5 minutes. Change into these

4191
02:07:30,840 --> 02:07:34,310

Hamada, you
say something!

4450
02:15:51,310 --> 02:15:53,020
Oh I don't
know any of them

4451
02:15:51,870 --> 02:15:53,020
You know one!

4452
02:15:54,290 --> 02:15:55,990

Stop the time!

4460
02:16:01,880 --> 02:16:03,520
We're really stuck together

4461

4462
02:16:05,650 --> 02:16:06,960
Seriously, he's doing nothing

4463
02:16:08,420 --> 02:16:10,460
Hamada, try naming just one group

4464
02:16:11,360 --> 02:16:15,100
King of Skits?

4465
02:16:12,690 --> 02:16:14,110

But we cleared it, right?

4468
02:16:19,780 --> 02:16:20,840
You cleared it

4469
02:16:20,250 --> 02:16:21,770
I felt like that was fast

4470
02:16:21,770 --> 02:16:25,410
The timer has 2 minutes, 26 seconds remaining

4471
02:16:22,650 --> 02:16:24,110
Still have time

4472
02:16:23,200 --> 02:16:24,520

4486
02:16:46,390 --> 02:16:47,600
The really thin one?

4487
02:16:48,350 --> 02:16:49,400
Who?

4488
02:16:49,750 --> 02:16:50,830
Who was it?

4489
02:16:51,380 --> 02:16:54,840
Well, doesn't
matter if it's not
the really thin one...

4490
02:16:53,870 --> 02:16:55,990
There are still plenty

4491
02:16:55,270 --> 02:16:57,560
It would be alright if
she wasn't really thin

4492
02:16:58,190 --> 02:16:59,390
Who else is there?

4493
02:17:00,710 --> 02:17:03,040
ASIAN

4494
02:17:02,190 --> 02:17:04,910
No, that's a duo act

4495
02:17:05,110 --> 02:17:08,150
Your natural stupidity is showing!!

4496
02:17:07,320 --> 02:17:08,980

4501
02:17:15,560 --> 02:17:17,540

02:17:23,430 --> 02:17:24,380
Hamada give us one

4507
02:17:24,380 --> 02:17:25,220
Just one more

4508
02:17:25,230 --> 02:17:26,230
Hamada give us one

4509
02:17:25,880 --> 02:17:27,950
Who's that
skinny girl?

4510
02:17:28,100 --> 02:17:29,470
I said I can't
remember the
skinny girl's name

4511
02:17:30,710 --> 02:17:33,710
But she's the only
solo act I can think of

4512
02:17:34,090 --> 02:17:35,660
The super skinny one

4513
02:17:35,390 --> 02:17:37,210
1 minute, 30 seconds remaining

4514
02:17:36,740 --> 02:17:37,930
Think!

4515
02:17:37,480 --> 02:17:38,600
You aren't
naming anyone

4516
02:17:38,260 --> 02:17:41,420
The one
with the clothes
drying rack, is she
from Yoshimoto?

4517
02:17:40,830 --> 02:17:41,780
She's not with Yoshimoto

We don't have
time for this!

4525
02:17:48,840 --> 02:17:49,790
Who is it?

4526
02:17:50,090 --> 02:17:51,040
Who else?

We wanted to see a Downtown mummy!

4607

What, why?

4608
02:19:44,510 --> 02:19:45,940

I know I should be happy, but y'know...

4612
02:19:53,350 --> 02:19:54,170
Nah

4613
02:19:54,650 --> 02:19:57,750
It ended so softly...

You kind of wanted to see it?

4615
02:19:58,540 --> 02:19:59,590
I kind of did

4616
02:20:00,670 --> 02:20:03,640
With this Hollywood star-like behavior

4617
02:20:04,130 --> 02:20:07,630
The wrath of the gods has been pacified...

4618
02:20:07,960 --> 02:20:12,570
They move outdoors to challenge the next stage

4619
02:20:13,300 --> 02:20:15,840
The next escape challenge

02:20:15,840 --> 02:20:20,510
Is going to slaughter all of you

4621
02:20:17,540 --> 02:20:20,510
This is crazy

4622
02:20:20,940 --> 02:20:22,710
Look at that!!

4623
02:20:22,710 --> 02:20:23,790
What's that?

4624
02:20:22,860 --> 02:20:24,400
What the heck is that?

4625
02:20:24,510 --> 02:20:25,610
What?

4626
02:20:26,480 --> 02:20:28,950

02:20:35,770 --> 02:20:37,360
to win this Superhuman Strength Stage

4633
02:20:37,660 --> 02:20:43,800
T/N: 8 meters is about 26.25ft.

4634
02:20:37,660 --> 02:20:43,800
The ball is 8 meters high, so can they do it!?

4635
02:20:40,750 --> 02:20:44,670
Can they climb it!?

4636
02:20:45,120 --> 02:20:46,550
Can you even break that?

4637
02:20:45,870 --> 02:20:46,930
With one hand?

4638
02:20:46,930 --> 02:20:49,370
One handed is just not possible

4639
02:20:49,370 --> 02:20:54,580
Among you, only 1 challenger needs to succeed for a clear

4640
02:20:49,370 --> 02:21:00,580

4644
02:20:53,610 --> 02:20:54,580
OK OK

4645
02:20:54,580 --> 02:21:00,580
If you fail, the leader will receive a punishment

4646
02:20:59,660 --> 02:21:00,360
Leader?

4647
02:21:00,580 --> 02:21:09,920

4650
02:21:06,590 --> 02:21:09,920
I'm the leader now?

4651
02:21:08,540 --> 02:21:09,910
I'm hearing this for the first time

4652
02:21:09,920 --> 02:21:11,960
Matsumoto is the leader

4653
02:21:11,960 --> 02:21:16,330
Now I'm the leader and I just did the mummy thing...

4654
02:21:14,430 --> 02:21:16,330
Isn't that an awful lot for me?

4655
02:21:16,330 --> 02:21:18,470
Prepare yourselves!!

4656
02:21:18,470 --> 02:21:21,070
He's not even going to listen to me...

4657
02:21:21,070 --> 02:21:22,670
First up is Hosei!

4658
02:21:22,820 --> 02:21:25,740
Challenger: Hosei

4659
02:21:23,740 --> 02:21:24,340

Challenge

4662
02:21:25,760 --> 02:21:27,880
It'd be nice if we could end it here

4663
02:21:27,880 --> 02:21:29,140
We're really counting on you

4664
02:21:29,640 --> 02:21:31,410
You seem awfully confident?

4665
02:21:31,410 --> 02:21:33,480
I practiced Kendo until my 3rd year of middle school

4666
02:21:31,410 --> 02:21:35,280
T/N: Kendo is a swords martial arts with bamboo and wooden swords.

02:21:34,830 --> 02:21:35,670
That's old news

4669
02:21:35,280 --> 02:21:38,490
How old are you now?

4670
02:21:35,400 --> 02:21:36,280
That's forever ago

4671
02:21:36,280 --> 02:21:38,490
51 years old

4672
02:21:38,490 --> 02:21:39,820
That's over 40 years ago

4673
02:21:38,990 --> 02:21:39,840
Well then, let's go!!

4674
02:21:46,180 --> 02:21:46,940
Good luck!

4675
02:21:46,940 --> 02:21:47,750
Go for it!

4676
02:21:49,110 --> 02:21:49,760
Uh Hosei?

4677
02:21:50,560 --> 02:21:51,050
Do it!

4678
02:21:51,080 --> 02:21:51,930
Hosei?

4679
02:21:51,400 --> 02:21:53,970
This is awful!

4680
02:21:51,930 --> 02:21:53,800
GO! JUST GO!

4681
02:21:54,700 --> 02:21:55,600
That's good!

4682
02:21:55,190 --> 02:21:55,950
OK Hosei!

4683
02:21:56,370 --> 02:21:56,800
Hosei

4684
02:21:56,800 --> 02:21:58,640
Good, good, let's go Hosei!

4685
02:21:58,640 --> 02:21:59,310
Yes!

4686
02:21:59,310 --> 02:22:00,170
Don't look down!! If you look down you'll get scared!!

4687
02:22:00,170 --> 02:22:01,910
Don't look down!! If you look down you'll get scared!!

4688
02:22:01,260 --> 02:22:01,910
Yes!

4689
02:22:01,910 --> 02:22:04,010
As if that's scary!!

4690
02:22:03,480 --> 02:22:04,810
His feet are on the ground

4691
02:22:04,010 --> 02:22:04,950
If you look down your legs will be paralyzed with fear!!

4692
02:22:04,950 --> 02:22:07,680
If you look down your legs will be paralyzed with fear!!

4693
02:22:06,280 --> 02:22:06,800
Yes!

4694
02:22:07,950 --> 02:22:09,450
Your feet are on the ground!!

4695
02:22:09,050 --> 02:22:10,470
Giving up already?!

4696
02:22:10,080 --> 02:22:10,640
Hosei?

4697
02:22:10,970 --> 02:22:12,220
Really?

4698
02:22:11,200 --> 02:22:11,940
Let's go!

4699
02:22:12,800 --> 02:22:17,330
Hosei Fails

4700
02:22:17,330 --> 02:22:19,690
Crap!!

4701
02:22:18,530 --> 02:22:20,330
He says "Crap!" even though

4702
02:22:19,490 --> 02:22:20,830
Barely anything, huh?

4703
02:22:20,430 --> 02:22:22,000
His feet were on the ground the whole time

4704
02:22:22,010 --> 02:22:23,510
Alright, Matsumoto!

4705
02:22:24,080 --> 02:22:24,770
Me?

4706
02:22:25,030 --> 02:22:28,570
Challenger Matsumoto

4707
02:22:25,370 --> 02:22:28,570
If I need to I can let go, right?

4708
02:22:27,400 --> 02:22:28,570
You can let go safely

4709
02:22:28,090 --> 02:22:28,870
Oh really?

4710
02:22:28,870 --> 02:22:29,990
Oi, Matsumoto

4711
02:22:29,990 --> 02:22:30,400
Yes

4712
02:22:30,400 --> 02:22:32,470
Because this is a "Superhuman Strength Stage"

4713
02:22:32,860 --> 02:22:33,870
You can use your

4714
02:22:33,870 --> 02:22:36,210
Arms only

4715
02:22:35,840 --> 02:22:36,880
Seriously?

4716
02:22:36,210 --> 02:22:40,180
The leader Matsumoto will climb with only his arms

4717
02:22:36,510 --> 02:22:37,850
He can't use his legs?

4718
02:22:37,560 --> 02:22:38,710
Yeah

4719
02:22:38,310 --> 02:22:40,180
Climb with only your arms!

4720
02:22:40,180 --> 02:22:41,330
Now, let's go!

4721
02:22:40,930 --> 02:22:42,370
Huh? Hold on

4722
02:22:43,450 --> 02:22:44,150
Okay

4723
02:22:44,150 --> 02:22:44,700
Let's go!!

4724
02:22:44,700 --> 02:22:45,420

02:22:51,590 --> 02:22:53,390
You can do it, Leader!

4727
02:22:53,540 --> 02:22:55,350
Wow

4728
02:22:55,500 --> 02:22:56,700
Leader!

4729
02:22:55,750 --> 02:22:57,700
You can do it!

4730
02:22:57,700 --> 02:23:00,500
He's got a crazy under bite!

4731
02:23:00,500 --> 02:23:02,400
Why is he sticking out his chin like that?

4732
02:23:03,050 --> 02:23:04,820
Leader, you're amazing!

4733
02:23:07,940 --> 02:23:12,180
Matsumoto Success

4734
02:23:09,590 --> 02:23:11,410
That was awful

4735
02:23:11,080 --> 02:23:12,300
Really?

4736
02:23:12,650 --> 02:23:15,450
Leader, that was amazing!!

4737
02:23:12,830 --> 02:23:14,180
It was really bad

4738
02:23:15,450 --> 02:23:16,630
You really got it!

4739
02:23:17,280 --> 02:23:18,370
Hell yeah!

4740
02:23:17,280 --> 02:23:18,540
As expected of our leader

4741
02:23:18,100 --> 02:23:19,250
Leader!

4742
02:23:19,290 --> 02:23:20,220
Leader!

4743
02:23:19,800 --> 02:23:21,090
You beat it, leader!

4744
02:23:22,260 --> 02:23:26,360
What was with that under bite?

4745
02:23:26,360 --> 02:23:27,130
He's been like that

4746
02:23:27,130 --> 02:23:28,830
He's been like that? Oh, I see!

4747
02:23:29,160 --> 02:23:30,920
Man, that was pretty tough

4748
02:23:31,730 --> 02:23:32,630
It was tough

4749
02:23:32,630 --> 02:23:38,140
Explosion

4750
02:23:32,630 --> 02:23:38,140
Hell Escape Game

4751
02:23:32,630 --> 02:23:38,140

4752
02:23:32,630 --> 02:23:38,140
Spinning

4753
02:23:32,630 --> 02:23:38,140

4758
02:23:33,270 --> 02:23:38,140
The next stage of the Hell Escape Game is...

4759
02:23:38,140 --> 02:23:41,280
Is this stage!!

4760
02:23:38,140 --> 02:23:41,280
The next challenge you'll be doing

4761
02:23:43,110 --> 02:23:44,810
To test your sense of balance, the Spinning Stage!!

4762
02:23:44,810 --> 02:23:48,020
To test your sense of balance, the Spinning Stage!!

4763
02:23:46,210 --> 02:23:48,870
Oh no this is rough

4764
02:23:48,870 --> 02:23:49,920
That's unexpected

4765
02:23:50,100 --> 02:23:56,220
Spin 30 times and then walk straight to make it to the goal in 10 seconds

4766
02:23:50,100 --> 02:24:01,060

02:23:56,220 --> 02:24:01,060
Fall into the flour hell on either side and lose

4769
02:24:01,060 --> 02:24:07,470
If they all fail, the leader will receive a punishment

4771
02:24:01,060 --> 02:24:07,470

02:24:13,010 --> 02:24:15,590
No way...

4779
02:24:17,700 --> 02:24:22,820
Tanaka

4780
02:24:17,700 --> 02:24:22,820
The first challenger is

4781
02:24:21,080 --> 02:24:22,820
But after this

4782
02:24:23,170 --> 02:24:27,090
Something extraordinary happens!

4783
02:24:27,590 --> 02:24:33,660
Goal

4784
02:24:30,040 --> 02:24:33,660
Challenger: Tanaka

4785
02:24:33,790 --> 02:24:36,860
Use both hands to grip the white rods on either side

4786
02:24:35,450 --> 02:24:36,360
Oh, sorry, okay!

4787
02:24:36,860 --> 02:24:39,170
Shouldn't you hold it lower?

4788
02:24:38,270 --> 02:24:39,170
Well then

4789
02:24:39,170 --> 02:24:42,100
Lower

4790
02:24:39,720 --> 02:24:40,770
Spinning Machine

4791
02:24:40,770 --> 02:24:42,000
It doesn't matter

4792
02:24:43,720 --> 02:24:45,420
Here's a counter

4793
02:24:49,590 --> 02:24:52,150
That's fast!

4794
02:24:52,150 --> 02:24:53,710
It's too fast!

4795
02:24:53,710 --> 02:25:01,170
I can't! It's too much! I feel sick!

4796
02:24:57,650 --> 02:25:01,170
It was so bad

4797
02:24:58,970 --> 02:25:01,170
10 spins left!

4798
02:25:02,170 --> 02:25:05,110
That speed!

4799
02:25:03,270 --> 02:25:05,110
It was 30 spins after all

4800
02:25:05,760 --> 02:25:09,350
30 spins cleared! Start!

4801
02:25:06,880 --> 02:25:09,350
Woah

4802
02:25:09,350 --> 02:25:11,330
Go quickly!

4803
02:25:11,880 --> 02:25:15,450
If he falls into the flour he's... OUT!

4804
02:25:14,140 --> 02:25:15,450
What just happaned?

4805
02:25:16,040 --> 02:25:18,210
What the heck was that?

4806
02:25:17,440 --> 02:25:19,110
What the hell, man

4807
02:25:19,110 --> 02:25:21,340
That was the worst performance!!

4808
02:25:21,680 --> 02:25:26,310
You gotta do better than that

4809
02:25:23,890 --> 02:25:26,310
You're kidding me, right?

4810
02:25:26,680 --> 02:25:29,720
Did that really just happen!?

4811
02:25:28,220 --> 02:25:29,720
That was no good

4812
02:25:29,720 --> 02:25:32,650
Start!

4813
02:25:30,700 --> 02:25:32,650
Go quickly!

4814
02:25:32,650 --> 02:25:36,920
If he falls into the flour he's... OUT!

4815
02:25:35,470 --> 02:25:36,920
What just happened?

4816
02:25:37,270 --> 02:25:39,410
That doesn't make sense

4817
02:25:37,910 --> 02:25:39,410
No, it does

4818
02:25:39,410 --> 02:25:41,310
You stopped there!

4819
02:25:40,140 --> 02:25:42,660
You rolled to the side after stopping

4820
02:25:41,310 --> 02:25:45,330
Rolling, rolling, rolling

4821
02:25:42,660 --> 02:25:45,330
My head was spinning, okay?

4822
02:25:45,970 --> 02:25:48,300
Why did you roll that way?

4823
02:25:48,300 --> 02:25:50,870
I couldn't stop my body

4824
02:25:49,600 --> 02:25:50,870
Stop lying

4825
02:25:50,870 --> 02:25:51,910
You stopped on the ground, then rolled over

4826
02:25:51,910 --> 02:25:54,640
You stopped on the ground, then rolled over

4827
02:25:52,760 --> 02:25:54,640
Stopped and rolled

4828
02:25:53,470 --> 02:25:54,640
Is that even possible?

4829
02:25:54,980 --> 02:25:59,010
It's possible

4830
02:25:57,130 --> 02:25:59,010
Are you serious?

4831
02:25:59,010 --> 02:26:02,820
Watch the replay and you'll be shocked

4832
02:26:02,820 --> 02:26:05,920
This machine has that effect

4833
02:26:04,650 --> 02:26:05,920
Exactly!

4834
02:26:05,120 --> 02:26:05,920
Really?

4835
02:26:05,920 --> 02:26:06,850
And next up, Narita will surely suffer the same fate

4836
02:26:06,850 --> 02:26:09,710
And next up, Narita will surely suffer the same fate

4837
02:26:09,990 --> 02:26:12,490
I'm counting on you, man

4838
02:26:10,590 --> 02:26:12,490
Stay on standby, Narita!

4839
02:26:12,530 --> 02:26:13,480
Good luck

4840
02:26:13,040 --> 02:26:15,800
It looks even scarier after seeing that

4841
02:26:15,980 --> 02:26:21,000
Challenger Narita Ryo

4842
02:26:15,980 --> 02:26:21,000
Challenger Narita Ryo

4843
02:26:16,610 --> 02:26:21,000
Next up, Narita Ryo

4844
02:26:21,000 --> 02:26:23,320
Don't mess up, Narita!

4845
02:26:21,350 --> 02:26:23,320
It was seriously hard

4846
02:26:22,340 --> 02:26:23,320
You can do it

4847
02:26:23,340 --> 02:26:24,420
Make it happen!

4848
02:26:24,150 --> 02:26:26,410
Okay

4849
02:26:24,460 --> 02:26:26,410
And don't fly off

4850
02:26:24,990 --> 02:26:26,410
Alright then,

4851
02:26:26,490 --> 02:26:27,590
Begin the spin!

4852
02:26:27,590 --> 02:26:28,290
Begin the spin!

4853
02:26:28,290 --> 02:26:31,010
Here I go

4854
02:26:31,110 --> 02:26:31,950
Oh crap!!

4855
02:26:31,950 --> 02:26:33,150
My legs are gonna fall off!!

4856
02:26:33,150 --> 02:26:34,330
My legs are gonna fall off!!

4857
02:26:34,220 --> 02:26:36,820
I can see that

4858
02:26:34,330 --> 02:26:35,780
Eh! Wait!

4859
02:26:35,970 --> 02:26:39,950
Wait! This is bad!

4860
02:26:37,990 --> 02:26:39,950
20 spins left!

4861
02:26:39,950 --> 02:26:42,090
His legs are going to fall off?

4862
02:26:39,950 --> 02:26:42,090
This isn't good at all!

4863
02:26:42,720 --> 02:26:44,990
His legs are going to fall off?

4864
02:26:43,170 --> 02:26:44,990
I can't keep up!

4865
02:26:44,280 --> 02:26:44,990
Hang in there

4866
02:26:45,390 --> 02:26:47,060
Seriously! My legs!

4867
02:26:46,160 --> 02:26:47,760
Your legs are going to fall off?

4868
02:26:47,760 --> 02:26:49,410
His legs can't keep up

4869
02:26:48,050 --> 02:26:51,680
My legs! It hurts! Seriously!

4870
02:26:51,730 --> 02:26:52,680
C'mon, you can do it!

4871
02:26:52,280 --> 02:26:53,420
You can do it!

4872
02:26:52,970 --> 02:26:53,780
Go!

4873
02:26:53,820 --> 02:26:54,640
You can do it!

4874
02:26:55,070 --> 02:26:56,050
Start!

4875
02:26:55,740 --> 02:26:56,850
Can he do it?

4876
02:26:58,820 --> 02:27:02,590
This is accurate

4877
02:26:59,720 --> 02:27:02,590
True

4878
02:27:02,590 --> 02:27:05,450
This is accurate

4879
02:27:02,940 --> 02:27:04,140
This!! This!!

4880
02:27:04,140 --> 02:27:05,450
This!! This!!

4881
02:27:05,450 --> 02:27:07,210
Tanaka, like this!

4882
02:27:08,150 --> 02:27:10,020
That is one way but

4883
02:27:10,020 --> 02:27:12,620
I was doing seriously doing my best

4884
02:27:13,520 --> 02:27:16,190
Narita showed the the way it should be!!

4885
02:27:14,050 --> 02:27:18,140
No no! I think so too! That was great

4886
02:27:17,010 --> 02:27:18,930
Yeah, that's bound to happen

4887
02:27:18,930 --> 02:27:20,260
That was great

4888
02:27:20,260 --> 02:27:22,480
Normally you would run this way

4889
02:27:22,310 --> 02:27:22,860
This way

4890
02:27:22,860 --> 02:27:25,130
I don't remember a thing.

4891
02:27:25,150 --> 02:27:25,620
Eh?

4892
02:27:25,620 --> 02:27:27,150
I was just heading straight

4893
02:27:27,150 --> 02:27:28,050
Really?

4894
02:27:28,070 --> 02:27:31,110
You spun clockwise so you'd naturally sway to the right

4895
02:27:30,040 --> 02:27:31,110
Yep, exactly

4896
02:27:31,110 --> 02:27:36,910
You faced the right way, but rolled the other way

4897
02:27:35,840 --> 02:27:36,910
I can't believe it

4898
02:27:37,180 --> 02:27:43,120
It makes no sense!

4899
02:27:37,240 --> 02:27:40,350
Give me a break!

4900
02:27:38,880 --> 02:27:41,330
I have to agree that it was unnatural

4901
02:27:39,050 --> 02:27:43,120
This was just too much

4902
02:27:40,350 --> 02:27:44,870
No, seriously! These things can happen too, right?

4903
02:27:44,870 --> 02:27:48,620
No way! Narita spun clockwise so he swayed this way

4904
02:27:47,500 --> 02:27:48,620
That's right

4905
02:27:48,620 --> 02:27:51,480
There's no control of your body, right?

4906
02:27:49,890 --> 02:27:53,630
You were focusing on running straight, weren't you?

4907
02:27:52,060 --> 02:27:53,630
Yes

4908
02:27:52,790 --> 02:27:54,860
I can understand that, I can sympathize with that

4909
02:27:54,960 --> 02:27:56,260
Yeah, that will happen

4910
02:27:55,730 --> 02:27:56,260
Right?

4911
02:27:56,400 --> 02:27:58,430
Landed onto his nose then kept rolling

4912
02:27:58,430 --> 02:28:00,670
Landed onto his nose then kept rolling

4913
02:28:00,670 --> 02:28:01,640
It's just like the convenience store's hand-rolled sushi

4914
02:28:01,640 --> 02:28:08,010
It's just like the convenience store's hand-rolled sushi

4915
02:28:03,940 --> 02:28:08,010
In terms of how it's made, yeah

4916
02:28:05,960 --> 02:28:08,010
It's kinda like that

4917
02:28:08,010 --> 02:28:11,750
In the end, it's impossible. There's no way we can do it

4918
02:28:11,750 --> 02:28:13,080
There is only one man who is good at this

4919
02:28:13,080 --> 02:28:16,980
There is only one man who is good at this

4920
02:28:14,280 --> 02:28:16,980
I'm not good!

4921
02:28:16,070 --> 02:28:16,980
Leader!

4922
02:28:16,980 --> 02:28:18,290
Back in the day I used to be good,

4923
02:28:18,290 --> 02:28:21,120
Back in the day I used to be good,

4924
02:28:19,120 --> 02:28:21,120
but I haven't done it in years

4925
02:28:20,550 --> 02:28:22,370
As you're the leader, that means...

4926
02:28:22,790 --> 02:28:24,010
50 spins!

4927
02:28:23,720 --> 02:28:31,770
50 spins is crazy

4928
02:28:24,120 --> 02:28:33,400
Leader Hamada challenges 50 spins

4929
02:28:27,080 --> 02:28:27,810
Seriously?

4930
02:28:27,810 --> 02:28:28,750
50?

4931
02:28:30,610 --> 02:28:33,400
Stop messing around!

4932
02:28:33,400 --> 02:28:34,570
Legend, you're up

4933
02:28:34,570 --> 02:28:35,800
Legend, you're up

4934
02:28:36,020 --> 02:28:43,040
Challenger Hamada

4935
02:28:36,020 --> 02:28:43,040
Challenger Hamada

4936
02:28:36,790 --> 02:28:43,040
56-year-old Hamada Masatoshi. Can he prove that his skills still exist?

4937
02:28:43,240 --> 02:28:44,610
Good luck, Hamada-san

4938
02:28:44,610 --> 02:28:48,420
Why the heck is it 50? 30 was enough!

4939
02:28:47,050 --> 02:28:51,500
Alright then, let the spin begin!

4940
02:28:47,830 --> 02:28:51,500
50 spins...

4941
02:28:48,650 --> 02:28:51,500
50 is quite a lot

4942
02:28:52,950 --> 02:28:54,470
Whoa! I'm going to fly off!

4943
02:28:54,470 --> 02:28:56,460
Whoa! I'm going to fly off!

4944
02:28:56,670 --> 02:28:57,960
I'm really going fly off!

4945
02:28:57,610 --> 02:28:58,940
It's a breeze for him

4946
02:28:59,110 --> 02:29:00,760
He's having fun!

4947
02:29:00,760 --> 02:29:02,560
My legs! My legs are going to fly off!

4948
02:29:02,900 --> 02:29:04,310
He's having so much fun!

4949
02:29:04,310 --> 02:29:06,350
No, seriously!

4950
02:29:07,600 --> 02:29:09,540
It's too easy for him

4951
02:29:07,600 --> 02:29:09,540
Narita was saying this too, my legs will seriously fly off!

4952
02:29:10,590 --> 02:29:14,240
I'm getting dizzy just watching

4953
02:29:11,920 --> 02:29:14,240
Same

4954
02:29:14,780 --> 02:29:16,890
30! You've reached 30!

4955
02:29:16,890 --> 02:29:19,280
My legs are going to fly off!

4956
02:29:18,010 --> 02:29:19,280
Almost 40!

4957
02:29:19,300 --> 02:29:22,080
Almost 40! Hang in there, Hamada-san!

4958
02:29:21,180 --> 02:29:22,370
10 spins left!

4959
02:29:22,370 --> 02:29:23,450
No, no, no!

4960
02:29:22,850 --> 02:29:24,600
This is amazing

4961
02:29:23,570 --> 02:29:25,300
Forty-four, five...

4962
02:29:26,500 --> 02:29:28,470
No way! This is impossible

4963
02:29:28,510 --> 02:29:29,720
Hamada-san!

4964
02:29:29,960 --> 02:29:33,140
My head is spinning like crazy!

4965
02:29:31,230 --> 02:29:31,980
Go for it!

4966
02:29:31,980 --> 02:29:33,140
You can do it!

4967
02:29:36,250 --> 02:29:37,980
Wow!

4968
02:29:41,590 --> 02:29:42,440
Wow!

4969
02:29:44,410 --> 02:29:45,560
Unbelievable!

4970
02:29:47,170 --> 02:29:49,710
It's not as good as before, but he's still got it

4971
02:29:49,710 --> 02:29:53,480
I would've sped through that in the past

4972
02:29:49,710 --> 02:29:53,480
That was truly amazing

4973
02:29:50,890 --> 02:29:53,480
In the past he actually ran normally

4974
02:29:53,480 --> 02:29:56,780
From the NES generation

4975
02:29:53,480 --> 02:29:56,780
Just like a video game character

4976
02:29:53,480 --> 02:29:56,780
T/N: NES as in Nintendo Entertainment System. This is the console before the Super Nintendo (SNES) that used floppy disks for games before they changed to using cartridges.

4977
02:29:57,450 --> 02:30:00,790
That's how those game characters walked in those days

4978
02:29:59,820 --> 02:30:02,060
Who runs like that?

4979
02:30:02,720 --> 02:30:03,720
Cleared!

4980
02:30:03,590 --> 02:30:04,990
Thanks!

4981
02:30:04,510 --> 02:30:08,200
Well done

4982
02:30:08,200 --> 02:30:13,700
Mummy

4983
02:30:08,200 --> 02:30:13,700
And now, they've reached the final challenge

4984
02:30:08,200 --> 02:30:13,700
Explosion

4985
02:30:08,200 --> 02:30:13,700
Hell Escape Game

4986
02:30:08,200 --> 02:30:13,700
Spinning

What the...

4994
02:30:16,670 --> 02:30:18,710
No way

4995
02:30:17,150 --> 02:30:18,710
It's huge

4996
02:30:19,370 --> 02:30:21,710
This is the last escape game

4997
02:30:21,710 --> 02:30:26,050
Between the Explosions

4998
02:30:21,710 --> 02:30:26,050
Between the Explosions

4999
02:30:26,210 --> 02:30:32,920
Here you will

5000
02:30:27,020 --> 02:30:29,220
choose 1 member to go on the reverse bungee

5001
02:30:29,220 --> 02:30:32,920
choose 1 member to go on the reverse bungee

5002
02:30:32,920 --> 02:30:35,890
The other five members must complete a quiz

5003
02:30:32,920 --> 02:30:44,830
All other members must answer questions correctly to pass.

5004
02:30:32,920 --> 02:30:44,830
One member will be strapped on the reverse bungee.

5005
02:30:32,920 --> 02:30:44,830
Rules

5006
02:30:32,920 --> 02:30:44,830
m 0 0 l 1732.5 0 1732.5 195 0 195

5007
02:30:36,160 --> 02:30:39,960
If all members answer correctly, then the chosen member is released

5008
02:30:39,960 --> 02:30:42,810
However if even one member fails to answer

5009
02:30:42,810 --> 02:30:44,830
The reverse bungee is launched

5010
02:30:44,830 --> 02:30:45,800
Into the air, followed by explosions, then death

5011
02:30:45,800 --> 02:30:46,370
Into the air, followed by explosions, then death

5012
02:30:46,370 --> 02:30:49,070
Into the air, followed by explosions, then death

5013
02:30:49,070 --> 02:30:50,770
That's stupid

5014
02:30:50,770 --> 02:30:52,840
That's insane

5015
02:30:51,210 --> 02:30:51,910
First, decide who will ride the reverse bungee

5016
02:30:51,910 --> 02:30:54,980
First, decide who will ride the reverse bungee

5017
02:30:53,370 --> 02:30:54,980
Discuss, then choose one person

5018
02:30:53,510 --> 02:30:54,980
You guys should choose

5019
02:30:55,710 --> 02:30:56,910
Ready, set, Narita

5020
02:30:56,910 --> 02:30:59,950
Ready, set, Narita

5021
02:30:56,910 --> 02:30:59,950
Ready, set, Narita

5022
02:30:56,910 --> 02:30:59,950
Ready, set, Narita

5023
02:30:56,910 --> 02:30:59,950
Ready, set, Narita

5024
02:30:56,910 --> 02:30:59,950
Ready, set, Narita

5025
02:30:58,360 --> 02:30:59,950
No, no, no. It can't be

5026
02:30:59,950 --> 02:31:03,180
Narita is your choice?

5027
02:31:01,980 --> 02:31:03,180
No way

5028
02:31:03,180 --> 02:31:04,840
This is Gaki no Tsukai

5029
02:31:04,070 --> 02:31:06,090
Of course

5030
02:31:05,290 --> 02:31:06,090
This is your baptism

5031
02:31:06,090 --> 02:31:06,790
This is Downtown's Gaki no Tsukai!

5032
02:31:06,790 --> 02:31:08,820
This is Downtown's Gaki no Tsukai!

5033
02:31:07,910 --> 02:31:08,820
You weren't listening!

5034
02:31:08,820 --> 02:31:10,630
Matsumoto-san, explain to him that if you fly

5035
02:31:10,630 --> 02:31:11,260
I will literally soil myself

5036
02:31:11,260 --> 02:31:13,800
I will literally soil myself

5037
02:31:13,800 --> 02:31:16,160
Do you really want to see that?

5038
02:31:16,200 --> 02:31:19,000
Yeah, not really...

5039
02:31:19,250 --> 02:31:19,920
Alright then!

5040
02:31:20,000 --> 02:31:22,870
I have no other choice but to do this, don't I?

5041
02:31:20,720 --> 02:31:22,500
No other choice

5042
02:31:22,500 --> 02:31:23,340
Standby!

5043
02:31:23,240 --> 02:31:24,870
We'll all answer the question for you!

5044
02:31:28,280 --> 02:31:34,350
The reverse bungee victim is Narita Ryo

5045
02:31:29,030 --> 02:31:34,350
Thus, Narita Ryo is sacrificed for the reverse bungee

5046
02:31:35,670 --> 02:31:37,100
It'll be alright

5047
02:31:37,120 --> 02:31:40,360
There's no way it will snap and send you to the national highway, right?

5048
02:31:38,990 --> 02:31:40,360
Not a chance

5049
02:31:40,360 --> 02:31:42,520
Even if it does, I will do something about it

5050
02:31:42,520 --> 02:31:45,960
You will do something about it?

5051
02:31:43,510 --> 02:31:45,960
He will do something if it happens

5052
02:31:46,330 --> 02:31:47,460
Narita, how are you feeling?

5053
02:31:47,160 --> 02:31:47,950
Yes

5054
02:31:47,460 --> 02:31:50,200
Narita, how are you feeling?

5055
02:31:50,200 --> 02:31:53,470
This is the worst

5056
02:31:54,400 --> 02:31:56,500
All we have to do is answer correctly, right?

5057
02:31:56,500 --> 02:31:58,810
Please. I'm counting on you guys

5058
02:31:57,270 --> 02:31:58,810
We'll set you free

5059
02:31:58,240 --> 02:32:00,880
Here are the rules

5060
02:32:00,310 --> 02:32:00,880
Okay

5061
02:32:00,880 --> 02:32:02,490
I'm counting on you!

5062
02:32:00,880 --> 02:32:04,750

5066
02:32:04,210 --> 02:32:04,750
Two minutes?

5067
02:32:04,950 --> 02:32:06,550
Well then

5068
02:32:06,550 --> 02:32:08,050
The question is this!

5069
02:32:08,050 --> 02:32:09,920
The question is this!

5070
02:32:10,220 --> 02:32:14,420
Who's the smart one?

5071
02:32:14,420 --> 02:34:14,410
Endo

5072
02:32:14,420 --> 02:34:14,410

What does that mean?

5085
02:32:17,380 --> 02:32:18,890
Smart one?

5086
02:32:18,090 --> 02:32:18,890
Please answer it

You have two minutes

5088
02:32:19,690 --> 02:32:24,430
Who is the smart one...

5089
02:32:20,900 --> 02:32:24,430
Who is smart one?

5090
02:32:25,030 --> 02:32:29,120
State the name and reason

5091
02:32:29,500 --> 02:32:30,410
Hm?

5092
02:32:31,340 --> 02:32:31,640
Eh? What does it mean? What does it mean?

5093
02:32:31,640 --> 02:32:32,110
Eh? What does it mean? What does it mean?

5094
02:32:32,110 --> 02:32:34,680
Eh? What does it mean? What does it mean?

5095
02:32:32,110 --> 02:32:34,680
I didn't get this one at all

5096
02:32:33,560 --> 02:32:34,680
It's is a riddle

5097
02:32:34,680 --> 02:32:36,310
A riddle, really?

5098
02:32:36,430 --> 02:32:38,450
No one is moving

5099
02:32:38,480 --> 02:32:40,380
Please start talking

5100
02:32:41,480 --> 02:32:43,080
Hey!

5101
02:32:42,870 --> 02:32:44,820
Who's the smart one?

5102
02:32:44,820 --> 02:32:46,950
Who is the smart one in the group!?

5103
02:32:47,570 --> 02:32:52,660
State the name and reason

5104
02:32:49,410 --> 02:32:52,660
Seriously, please let us know

5105
02:32:50,890 --> 02:32:52,660
I seriously don't get it

5106
02:32:52,660 --> 02:32:55,930
Who's the smart one?

5107
02:32:59,820 --> 02:33:00,650
Matsumoto-san

5108
02:33:02,000 --> 02:33:04,060
Whenever you're ready

5109
02:33:07,530 --> 02:33:11,800
The reason is... Correct!

5110
02:33:11,800 --> 02:33:12,660
The reason is... Correct!

5111
02:33:12,650 --> 02:33:15,570
Hosei Correct

5112
02:33:12,650 --> 02:33:15,570
Yeah!

5113
02:33:13,820 --> 02:33:17,200
Thank you so much!
Wait, all of you guys
have to answer...?

5114
02:33:17,050 --> 02:33:19,700
The reason is... Correct!

5115
02:33:19,700 --> 02:33:20,520
The reason is... Correct!

5116
02:33:20,520 --> 02:33:23,260
Matsumoto Correct

5117
02:33:20,520 --> 02:33:23,260
Matsumoto Correct

5118
02:33:21,120 --> 02:33:23,260
You can do it!

5119
02:33:25,680 --> 02:33:29,060
The reason is... Correct!

5120
02:33:26,630 --> 02:33:29,830
I have no clue

5121
02:33:29,060 --> 02:33:29,830
The reason is... Correct!

5122
02:33:29,900 --> 02:33:31,380
Nice!

5123
02:33:29,900 --> 02:33:32,930
Tanaka Correct

5124
02:33:29,900 --> 02:33:32,930
Tanaka Correct

5125
02:33:31,400 --> 02:33:35,270
It'll be alright, Narita!

5126
02:33:31,880 --> 02:33:35,270
Only two people left

5127
02:33:34,490 --> 02:33:35,270
You can solve it

5128
02:33:35,270 --> 02:33:38,640
We'll save you, Ryo!

5129
02:33:36,400 --> 02:33:38,640
You can solve it!

5130
02:33:37,310 --> 02:33:38,640
Please answer it!

5131
02:33:38,640 --> 02:33:39,910
They already solved it. They're just pretending

5132
02:33:39,910 --> 02:33:41,340
They already solved it. They're just pretending

5133
02:33:41,340 --> 02:33:44,380
For the drama?

5134
02:33:44,380 --> 02:33:46,650
30 seconds left!

5135
02:33:47,220 --> 02:33:50,220
I seriously have no idea

5136
02:33:50,720 --> 02:33:53,990
I already solved it without looking,

5137
02:33:50,720 --> 02:33:53,990
you know!

5138
02:33:55,770 --> 02:33:57,340
20 seconds left!

5139
02:33:56,220 --> 02:33:59,510
20 seconds left!

5140
02:33:57,340 --> 02:33:59,510
The smart one!

5141
02:33:58,740 --> 02:33:59,510
Please!

5142
02:33:59,860 --> 02:34:03,260
15! 15 seconds!

5143
02:34:00,230 --> 02:34:02,480
Look at it from another perspective!

5144
02:34:02,480 --> 02:34:03,260
The alphabet!

5145
02:34:03,400 --> 02:34:05,370
Hint!
It's a hint!

5146
02:34:04,770 --> 02:34:09,770
TEN... NINE... EIGHT

5147
02:34:05,120 --> 02:34:07,340
Change it into the alphabet!

5148
02:34:07,340 --> 02:34:09,770
The alphabet

5149
02:34:08,190 --> 02:34:09,770
Please answer it!

5150
02:34:13,510 --> 02:34:14,390
Correct!

5151
02:34:14,540 --> 02:34:15,190
Hurry up!

5152
02:34:15,190 --> 02:34:16,390
Time's up!

5153
02:34:16,960 --> 02:34:17,960
Hamada-san!

5154
02:34:18,000 --> 02:34:18,550
Yes?

5155
02:34:19,250 --> 02:34:21,480
What on earth are you doing!!

5156
02:34:21,480 --> 02:34:23,890
Who cares if it's for the drama or whatever

5157
02:34:24,550 --> 02:34:26,020
Seriously, I have no idea

5158
02:34:26,020 --> 02:34:28,760
Seriously, I have no idea

5159
02:34:28,760 --> 02:34:31,530
The biggest hint is the alphabet

5160
02:34:30,260 --> 02:34:31,530
It's the alphabet, man

5161
02:34:31,130 --> 02:34:32,990
Who's the smart one?

5162
02:34:31,530 --> 02:34:32,990
The alphabet?

5163
02:34:32,990 --> 02:34:37,170
Who starts with the letter "E"?

5164
02:34:32,990 --> 02:34:39,570
T/N: In Japanese, "smart person" is phrased as, "one with a good head". However, another interpretation would be, "one with 'E' at the start" because the word for "good" is pronounced just like the letter "E" and "head" can be interpreted as "the start".

5165
02:34:34,900 --> 02:34:37,170
Who starts with the letter "E"?

5166
02:34:36,080 --> 02:34:37,170
Yeah, that's it

5167
02:34:37,170 --> 02:34:39,570
Ah, name that starts with "E"! Endo!

5168
02:34:39,570 --> 02:34:43,940
ANSWER Endo Shozo

5169
02:34:39,570 --> 02:34:43,940
Spelled in romaji, the "E" is pronounced as "ii"

5170
02:34:39,570 --> 02:34:43,940
T/N: Hamada struggled because Japanese is a phonetic language, meaning that each letter/syllable is only pronounced in one way. So the "E" in "Endo" is always an "eh" sound, never an "ii" sound. "Romaji" means the romanization of the Japanese language.

5171
02:34:39,570 --> 02:34:43,940
m 0 0 l 1455 0 1455 195 0 195

5172
02:34:43,940 --> 02:34:44,970
Ryo, my bad!!

5173
02:34:44,970 --> 02:34:48,140
Ryo, my bad!!

5174
02:34:45,770 --> 02:34:48,140
Why are you laughing?!

5175
02:34:48,160 --> 02:34:49,040
HAMADA-SAN

5176
02:34:49,040 --> 02:34:53,330
Please don't laugh!

5177
02:34:51,950 --> 02:34:55,830
We are truly sorry

5178
02:34:54,570 --> 02:34:57,080
As we're all aware

5179
02:34:57,080 --> 02:34:58,190
Into the sky, followed by explosions, then death

5180
02:34:58,190 --> 02:35:00,220
Into the sky, followed by explosions, then death

5181
02:35:00,220 --> 02:35:04,990
To make up for the disappointment

5182
02:35:01,260 --> 02:35:04,990
let's at least have the explosion be brilliant

5183
02:35:04,990 --> 02:35:06,860
Narita-kun, any last words?

5184
02:35:06,260 --> 02:35:06,860
Let's hear it

5185
02:35:08,360 --> 02:35:13,130
I don't care what happens to you all!!

5186
02:35:12,570 --> 02:35:14,340
It seems he has accepted his fate

5187
02:35:14,340 --> 02:35:15,340
Let's begin

5188
02:35:15,340 --> 02:35:17,240
Well then, launching in

5189
02:35:15,850 --> 02:35:19,140
I wouldn't like to be in his shoes

5190
02:35:17,410 --> 02:35:19,140
Three!

5191
02:35:19,790 --> 02:35:20,780
Brace yourself!

5192
02:35:22,080 --> 02:35:22,980
Launch!

5193
02:35:47,690 --> 02:35:50,000
That's crazy!

5194
02:35:50,000 --> 02:35:51,910
Cracking up

5195
02:35:51,910 --> 02:35:53,340
Cracking up

5196
02:35:53,340 --> 02:35:54,240
Cracking up

5197
02:35:54,230 --> 02:35:56,440
That is hell

5198
02:35:54,240 --> 02:35:56,440
Cracking up

5199
02:35:56,690 --> 02:35:58,260
That is hell!

5200
02:35:58,010 --> 02:35:59,630
That was scary

5201
02:35:59,200 --> 02:36:01,570
I know, right

5202
02:36:02,850 --> 02:36:07,290
If he soiled himself I wouldn't be surprised

5203
02:36:06,200 --> 02:36:07,290
Yeah

5204
02:36:07,290 --> 02:36:08,520
Are you okay?

5205
02:36:08,520 --> 02:36:08,720
It's-it's still moving

5206
02:36:08,720 --> 02:36:08,920
It's-it's still moving

5207
02:36:08,920 --> 02:36:10,630
It's-it's still moving

5208
02:36:10,630 --> 02:36:11,790
Want to go a second round?

5209
02:36:11,790 --> 02:36:15,160
I no go!!

5210
02:36:13,160 --> 02:36:15,050
I no go?

5211
02:36:15,160 --> 02:36:17,330
I no go!!

5212
02:36:18,520 --> 02:36:19,830
You will no go, right?

5213
02:36:20,530 --> 02:36:22,270
Guys, was everything okay ?

5214
02:36:21,500 --> 02:36:22,270
Yeah

5215
02:36:22,270 --> 02:36:24,770
That was a great experience, huh

5216
02:36:23,340 --> 02:36:24,770
I'm not okay!!

5217
02:36:25,170 --> 02:36:28,940
Narita Ryo-san, thank you very much

5218
02:36:27,240 --> 02:36:28,210
Wait ah...

5219
02:36:27,490 --> 02:36:28,940
Thank you!

5220
02:36:28,210 --> 02:36:28,940
Wait ah...

5221
02:36:31,480 --> 02:36:34,350
He's God

5222
02:36:32,230 --> 02:36:33,450
That was amazing

5223
02:36:33,450 --> 02:36:35,020
He's like the Supreme Commander

5224
02:36:35,180 --> 02:36:40,450
Supreme Commander

5225
02:36:35,180 --> 02:36:40,450
Supreme Commander

5226
02:36:37,170 --> 02:36:38,500
Oh yeah, true!

5227
02:36:39,240 --> 02:36:40,450
He'll make commands

5228
02:36:40,660 --> 02:36:43,060
Please hurry up and release me~!!

5229
02:36:40,970 --> 02:36:43,060
He's so cool

5230
02:36:43,090 --> 02:36:46,010
The harsh escape games are over

5231
02:36:44,240 --> 02:36:46,010
That concludes the escape game

5232
02:36:46,040 --> 02:36:51,700
Laughing traps will only get harsher from now on

5233
02:36:46,040 --> 02:36:51,700
Laughing traps will only get harsher from now on

5234
02:36:53,540 --> 02:36:55,840
We can't trust you anymore, Tanaka

5235
02:36:55,840 --> 02:36:56,820
No, no. You can't...

5236
02:36:56,550 --> 02:37:00,490
This will cling on to you forever

5237
02:36:58,280 --> 02:37:01,330
Well a little bit

5238
02:37:01,780 --> 02:37:04,310
You fell in the opposite direction of the spin

5239
02:37:03,760 --> 02:37:04,300
That's right

5240
02:37:04,780 --> 02:37:07,550
You looked so dizzy

5241
02:37:06,520 --> 02:37:07,550
and went spinning

5242
02:37:07,550 --> 02:37:08,050
That's not true! That's not true!!

5243
02:37:08,050 --> 02:37:10,380
That's not true! That's not true!!

5244
02:37:09,000 --> 02:37:10,390
That'd be quite suspicious

5245
02:37:10,390 --> 02:37:10,750
No, but that's what happened

5246
02:37:10,750 --> 02:37:12,690
No, but that's what happened

5247
02:37:12,690 --> 02:37:14,070
That's the only way you could look at it

5248
02:37:15,330 --> 02:37:19,760
Please look at it

5249
02:37:16,630 --> 02:37:19,760
and then everyone can judge if that's true

5250
02:37:19,770 --> 02:37:23,100
I am ao ao ao ao

5251
02:37:23,440 --> 02:37:25,210
See, even your jaws can't move properly

5252
02:37:24,060 --> 02:37:25,510
You're all shaken

5253
02:37:26,120 --> 02:37:31,600
6 hours have passed of their school life

5254
02:37:31,760 --> 02:37:37,670
Special class has ended, now returning to the classroom

5255
02:37:36,860 --> 02:37:38,880
We‘re back

5256
02:37:37,060 --> 02:37:38,880
We sure are

5257
02:37:39,720 --> 02:37:41,180
Geez...

5258
02:37:41,620 --> 02:37:44,180
Notice

5259
02:37:43,640 --> 02:37:49,650
The drawers have all been reset

5260
02:37:44,190 --> 02:37:51,220
The drawers

5261
02:37:44,190 --> 02:37:51,220
have all been reset

5262
02:37:51,560 --> 02:37:53,730
Who's behind this?

5263
02:37:53,900 --> 02:37:55,440
Once again

5264
02:37:56,040 --> 02:37:58,300
It's only the contents

5265
02:37:58,300 --> 02:37:59,830
The surroundings are the same

5266
02:37:59,070 --> 02:37:59,830
That's true

5267
02:38:00,040 --> 02:38:01,210
It is true

5268
02:38:01,270 --> 02:38:03,810
Yeah, it's the same

5269
02:38:05,210 --> 02:38:06,330
For real

5270
02:38:06,850 --> 02:38:10,580
Shall we go for the drawers then?

5271
02:38:08,940 --> 02:38:13,180
It did say that they've all been reset, just to inform us

5272
02:38:14,010 --> 02:38:14,780
Shall we do it?

5273
02:38:16,170 --> 02:38:16,850
Let us

5274
02:38:16,890 --> 02:38:20,940
Yeah, let us. We to have to cross this bridge eventually anyway

5275
02:38:17,390 --> 02:38:17,970
Eh, but...

5276
02:38:19,660 --> 02:38:24,290
Tanaka as the first one up

5277
02:38:22,730 --> 02:38:23,350
Here I go

5278
02:38:27,320 --> 02:38:28,000
Another key

5279
02:38:28,130 --> 02:38:31,600
Key for locker no. 1

5280
02:38:28,540 --> 02:38:29,230
Key?

5281
02:38:30,750 --> 02:38:34,800
Makes sense since there are still many unopened lockers

5282
02:38:34,140 --> 02:38:35,000
No. 1

5283
02:38:34,170 --> 02:38:37,000
Locker no. 1

5284
02:38:37,010 --> 02:38:37,710
No. 1?

5285
02:38:38,140 --> 02:38:40,510
Isn't no. 1 huge?

5286
02:38:38,590 --> 02:38:39,510
It is huge

5287
02:38:43,450 --> 02:38:45,280
Will this be okay?

5288
02:38:48,240 --> 02:38:48,480
What is it?

5289
02:38:48,480 --> 02:38:48,850
What is it?

5290
02:38:48,850 --> 02:38:49,860
What is it?

5291
02:38:49,580 --> 02:38:50,750
It's in a wooden box

5292
02:38:51,840 --> 02:38:53,890
There's a fragile sticker on the side

5293
02:38:52,260 --> 02:38:57,160
A mysterious item in a wooden box

5294
02:38:52,330 --> 02:38:53,340
It says fragile

5295
02:38:55,110 --> 02:38:56,130
It's a wooden box

5296
02:38:56,330 --> 02:38:58,880
Yes, it's in a solid box

5297
02:38:58,970 --> 02:39:00,490
I will open it

5298
02:39:06,610 --> 02:39:08,100
Eh, what is it?

5299
02:39:12,900 --> 02:39:14,900
What the hell?

5300
02:39:15,850 --> 02:39:19,590
It's made so well

5301
02:39:15,850 --> 02:39:20,480
A Bottled Baby Gorilla Hamada

5302
02:39:16,990 --> 02:39:17,990
What is that thing?

5303
02:39:23,580 --> 02:39:26,410
It's so well-made and cute to boot

5304
02:39:25,970 --> 02:39:28,040
It really is well-made

5305
02:39:30,530 --> 02:39:32,660
It's so damn cute

5306
02:39:31,230 --> 02:39:32,480
It is cute

5307
02:39:32,670 --> 02:39:35,380
Cute

5308
02:39:33,760 --> 02:39:34,750
For real

5309
02:39:35,810 --> 02:39:37,440
Don't you find it cute?

5310
02:39:38,160 --> 02:39:39,280
It is so cute

5311
02:39:39,100 --> 02:39:42,480
It really is so damn cute

5312
02:39:43,840 --> 02:39:45,940
The heck you doing?

5313
02:39:45,170 --> 02:39:47,140
Sorry. Because it's so cute

5314
02:39:48,950 --> 02:39:52,450
Can we take it out?

5315
02:39:51,440 --> 02:39:52,570
I think we can

5316
02:39:52,860 --> 02:39:53,940
Will the neck snap?

5317
02:39:57,480 --> 02:39:59,440
It's so real

5318
02:40:03,430 --> 02:40:05,530
Grab it by the body

5319
02:40:07,240 --> 02:40:09,270
He's angry because of the way you held it

5320
02:40:09,940 --> 02:40:13,170
Why did you keep grabbing it by the head?

5321
02:40:11,580 --> 02:40:13,170
So cute!

5322
02:40:15,040 --> 02:40:17,100
It's no good if you don't embrace it

5323
02:40:17,150 --> 02:40:19,490
It's like a newborn baby

5324
02:40:19,960 --> 02:40:21,110
Let's have him be held

5325
02:40:21,510 --> 02:40:24,680
Please hold it in your arms

5326
02:40:22,250 --> 02:40:25,010
Well it's not an issue of embracing it or not

5327
02:40:25,150 --> 02:40:27,120
His neck is still weak

5328
02:40:26,890 --> 02:40:27,360
Hold up

5329
02:40:27,440 --> 02:40:28,290
The eyes are still not...

5330
02:40:28,860 --> 02:40:31,880
He probably can't see well yet...

5331
02:40:31,750 --> 02:40:33,420
This is a happy moment

5332
02:40:33,760 --> 02:40:38,190
It's not about happiness or any of that...

5333
02:40:35,310 --> 02:40:36,760
Could you embrace him?

5334
02:40:37,350 --> 02:40:40,070
It's just a doll so I don't care

5335
02:40:49,820 --> 02:40:52,580
What's up with this

5336
02:40:50,710 --> 02:40:52,400
So cute

5337
02:40:52,770 --> 02:40:53,830
It's a baby gorilla

5338
02:40:56,550 --> 02:41:01,050
You should take it home with you

5339
02:40:58,310 --> 02:40:59,750
That's right

5340
02:40:58,990 --> 02:41:00,720
That would be good

5341
02:41:00,300 --> 02:41:01,830
Good idea

5342
02:41:02,120 --> 02:41:02,840
It keeps looking

5343
02:41:03,020 --> 02:41:04,160
It keeps...

5344
02:41:03,750 --> 02:41:04,530
Really

5345
02:41:05,630 --> 02:41:06,850
Right right

5346
02:41:05,790 --> 02:41:08,250
Should we lull it to sleep somewhere?

5347
02:41:08,260 --> 02:41:11,190
It's not a living thing just a doll...

5348
02:41:11,760 --> 02:41:14,990
But our affection to it is real

5349
02:41:12,380 --> 02:41:15,580
That's right. This is no simple matter, we need to...

5350
02:41:14,510 --> 02:41:17,360
It's not about lulling it to sleep

5351
02:41:15,510 --> 02:41:16,230
Right

5352
02:41:18,300 --> 02:41:21,300
I'd wish for them to make one of all the members

5353
02:41:21,180 --> 02:41:23,070
It's always only Hamada...

5354
02:41:22,040 --> 02:41:23,870
But could it be...

5355
02:41:23,950 --> 02:41:24,550
Take a look?

5356
02:41:24,660 --> 02:41:25,050
Huh?

5357
02:41:25,100 --> 02:41:26,830
Would be nice to get as a present

5358
02:41:26,970 --> 02:41:27,950
I would be delighted

5359
02:41:28,880 --> 02:41:29,490
See?

5360
02:41:29,540 --> 02:41:30,010
See?

5361
02:41:30,000 --> 02:41:35,180
Key to locker no. 3

5362
02:41:30,050 --> 02:41:30,700
See!

5363
02:41:30,210 --> 02:41:31,490
There might be one

5364
02:41:32,600 --> 02:41:33,420
Everyone is getting

5365
02:41:33,440 --> 02:41:35,000
Probably not a present

5366
02:41:35,560 --> 02:41:38,150
I want to get them all

5367
02:41:37,110 --> 02:41:39,080
That would be nice

5368
02:41:40,230 --> 02:41:41,990
Eh!?

5369
02:41:41,230 --> 02:41:43,070
There's something inside

5370
02:41:43,200 --> 02:41:50,230
Mysterious pouch & letter

5371
02:41:44,060 --> 02:41:44,340
See?

5372
02:41:44,880 --> 02:41:50,040
It says to read it before opening the pouch

5373
02:41:50,640 --> 02:41:52,900
Why is the bag so huge?

5374
02:41:53,740 --> 02:42:01,870
The Invincible School Jacket:

5375
02:41:55,430 --> 02:42:01,870
The legendary jacket worn by the invincible gang leader.

5376
02:41:57,980 --> 02:42:01,870
Putting this on will grant you the highest authority in the classroom

5377
02:42:01,950 --> 02:42:09,820
As the invincible gang leader, you can order the students around

5378
02:42:07,150 --> 02:42:09,820
and of course you can also talk informal to everyone

5379
02:42:09,840 --> 02:42:19,290
Furthermore if you laugh, the punishment

5380
02:42:11,570 --> 02:42:19,290
may be given to other students

5381
02:42:17,050 --> 02:42:18,840
It's worse than the baggy pants

5382
02:42:19,330 --> 02:42:20,350
A king

5383
02:42:19,530 --> 02:42:21,110
It's like a freaking king!!

5384
02:42:20,660 --> 02:42:21,120
Invincible

5385
02:42:21,120 --> 02:42:23,230
And why is Hosei getting this?

5386
02:42:21,970 --> 02:42:26,630
Series: Strongest items

5387
02:42:24,260 --> 02:42:26,520
We are getting many lucky items

5388
02:42:26,990 --> 02:42:28,230
Lucky items...

5389
02:42:27,540 --> 02:42:30,340
But it should've just ended with Tanaka's baggy pants...

5390
02:42:30,310 --> 02:42:31,710
Right?

5391
02:42:39,740 --> 02:42:41,430
Shouldn't this belong to Hamada?

5392
02:42:40,890 --> 02:42:46,350
T/N: Ogawa Natsumi is Hamada's wife.

5393
02:42:40,890 --> 02:42:46,350
The Legendary Gang Leader

5394
02:42:40,890 --> 02:42:46,350
The passionate lover of Ogawa Natsumi

5395
02:42:44,780 --> 02:42:47,020
What's up with that?

5396
02:42:46,460 --> 02:42:47,930
Shouldn't it be different?

5397
02:42:47,940 --> 02:42:49,080
What the...

5398
02:42:48,410 --> 02:42:49,790
Doesn't this belong to Hamada?

5399
02:42:49,700 --> 02:42:51,430
Right, originally it should've been

5400
02:42:52,070 --> 02:42:54,560
What's up with that?

5401
02:42:53,880 --> 02:42:55,880
What do you mean? It's an Invincible Jacket

5402
02:42:56,240 --> 02:42:57,830
It says, "Natsumi for Life"

5403
02:42:58,240 --> 02:42:58,890
That's right

5404
02:42:58,650 --> 02:43:02,460
Together with Natsumi for 30 years and since then to now, I love you

5405
02:43:03,510 --> 02:43:07,240
Yankee style

5406
02:43:03,580 --> 02:43:05,470
What a powerful message

5407
02:43:04,030 --> 02:43:05,870
Right

5408
02:43:06,390 --> 02:43:07,210
Such affection

5409
02:43:07,620 --> 02:43:09,630
As it says on the card

5410
02:43:10,150 --> 02:43:12,480
While I don't want to speak informally

5411
02:43:12,480 --> 02:43:15,350
Imma do it!!

5412
02:43:16,000 --> 02:43:17,640
With Cocorico, you already have been

5413
02:43:17,730 --> 02:43:18,530
That's right

5414
02:43:18,540 --> 02:43:22,050
But if you go too far with it

5415
02:43:22,130 --> 02:43:24,060
it will give you a bad image

5416
02:43:24,860 --> 02:43:27,460
For reals?

5417
02:43:27,570 --> 02:43:28,600
Scary scary scary

5418
02:43:28,660 --> 02:43:30,060
Why do you keep staring?

5419
02:43:29,600 --> 02:43:33,770
If you do that you will drag Downtown down...

5420
02:43:31,660 --> 02:43:33,250
That's right

5421
02:43:34,870 --> 02:43:36,640
Getting real thirsty

5422
02:43:37,000 --> 02:43:37,940
Getting real thirsty!

5423
02:43:38,810 --> 02:43:42,510
Oi!! Sakurada Junko

5424
02:43:38,810 --> 02:43:42,510
T/N: Sakurada Junko is a Japanese singer and actress who retired from show business. Tanaka may possibly be called by her name due to kind of having a similar hairstyle when she was young.

5425
02:43:43,280 --> 02:43:45,650
Taking a lot of liberties

5426
02:43:45,650 --> 02:43:49,850
Go an' guess what I wanna drink

5427
02:43:51,220 --> 02:43:54,150
How 'bout tea?

5428
02:43:51,220 --> 02:43:54,150
T/N: The formal way of saying tea which is "cha" is "ocha". Tanaka dropped the formal "o" prefix to make it informal, but it sounds odd because almost no one uses the informal word for tea.

5429
02:43:52,170 --> 02:43:53,210
Tea?

5430
02:43:56,660 --> 02:43:59,460
Did you just say tea?

5431
02:43:58,990 --> 02:44:02,730
Come on, that had nothing to do with anything, get it together

5432
02:44:03,160 --> 02:44:05,860
Me too? No way

5433
02:44:07,140 --> 02:44:10,940
Ah he's not getting slapped

5434
02:44:10,940 --> 02:44:11,810
The Invincible Jacket!

5435
02:44:11,810 --> 02:44:15,580
Can't you order someone to be slapped?

5436
02:44:14,470 --> 02:44:15,400
Ah, I see

5437
02:44:16,020 --> 02:44:16,560
Right

5438
02:44:16,680 --> 02:44:18,740
I feel so bad for poor Hamada

5439
02:44:18,850 --> 02:44:19,500
Matsumoto

5440
02:44:25,530 --> 02:44:27,820
Really, right here hurts, the pain is getting intense!!

5441
02:44:27,980 --> 02:44:28,560
Surprised me

5442
02:44:28,280 --> 02:44:30,230
I can feel it right here

5443
02:44:30,260 --> 02:44:31,280
Surprised me

5444
02:44:30,910 --> 02:44:32,310
The pain in my butt is getting worse

5445
02:44:32,700 --> 02:44:35,290
I will also take a peek

5446
02:44:35,420 --> 02:44:37,330
Something superior might appear

5447
02:44:37,740 --> 02:44:39,680
Something that could beat...

5448
02:44:39,710 --> 02:44:42,800
See? Here it is!

5449
02:44:43,080 --> 02:44:44,490
Everyone is getting keys

5450
02:44:43,910 --> 02:44:49,440
Key to locker no. 28

5451
02:44:44,140 --> 02:44:44,790
That's right

5452
02:44:44,790 --> 02:44:45,450
Number 28

5453
02:44:45,450 --> 02:44:46,510
Number 28

5454
02:44:46,900 --> 02:44:47,840
28 is this way

5455
02:44:47,850 --> 02:44:50,040
Might be superior to the invincible items

5456
02:44:50,320 --> 02:44:54,310
Freaking huge!!

5457
02:44:51,830 --> 02:44:52,720
Eh, is it huge?

5458
02:44:57,610 --> 02:44:58,650
What could it be?

5459
02:44:58,980 --> 02:44:59,840
What is it?

5460
02:44:59,930 --> 02:45:02,980
Wait. What is it?

5461
02:44:59,950 --> 02:45:01,250
Hold up

5462
02:45:01,290 --> 02:45:04,990
Mysterious pouch

5463
02:45:03,810 --> 02:45:04,630
It's huge

5464
02:45:05,800 --> 02:45:07,960
Might be another invincible thing

5465
02:45:08,020 --> 02:45:08,930
From the invincible series

5466
02:45:16,140 --> 02:45:19,340
Funny macho doll

5467
02:45:20,470 --> 02:45:22,610
So cool looking

5468
02:45:22,370 --> 02:45:23,270
It's amazing

5469
02:45:23,310 --> 02:45:25,170
This thing is impressive

5470
02:45:24,590 --> 02:45:25,810
What is this thing?

5471
02:45:30,240 --> 02:45:31,540
That face though...

5472
02:45:31,390 --> 02:45:36,660
But hold up!!

5473
02:45:36,700 --> 02:45:37,850
For real, right?

5474
02:45:37,310 --> 02:45:37,680
Right

5475
02:45:38,100 --> 02:45:41,690
Think about praising me or something...

5476
02:45:41,700 --> 02:45:43,780
We've known each other for a long time

5477
02:45:44,370 --> 02:45:49,500
It's like we are brothers...

5478
02:45:51,510 --> 02:45:55,140
Haven't you grown more hair since last year?

5479
02:45:56,850 --> 02:45:58,710
Hamada

5480
02:46:04,320 --> 02:46:07,020
It was too obvious

5481
02:46:05,630 --> 02:46:07,280
Too obvious

5482
02:46:06,260 --> 02:46:10,470
Wait, that's not it, I just thought, "Oh, maybe that's it"

5483
02:46:10,470 --> 02:46:13,060
No way because it was too obvious

5484
02:46:13,500 --> 02:46:14,690
What is that thing?

5485
02:46:14,700 --> 02:46:18,330
It's like an exact replica?

5486
02:46:16,440 --> 02:46:18,710
It's pretty well-made

5487
02:46:18,740 --> 02:46:20,570
What a hot bod

5488
02:46:21,310 --> 02:46:22,290
Let's put them together

5489
02:46:22,070 --> 02:46:23,300
Poooooooooot

5490
02:46:24,040 --> 02:46:26,040
Ehh?

5491
02:46:26,050 --> 02:46:28,410
It made a sound?

5492
02:46:26,650 --> 02:46:27,340
What's up

5493
02:46:27,360 --> 02:46:28,410
What did it...

5494
02:46:34,790 --> 02:46:37,850
What a freaky shriek!?

5495
02:46:38,910 --> 02:46:42,570
What's worse is that he has the invincible item

5496
02:46:42,740 --> 02:46:44,880
Wait

5497
02:46:43,800 --> 02:46:44,930
Every time

5498
02:46:49,160 --> 02:46:49,630
Endo

5499
02:46:50,060 --> 02:46:51,330
Eh? Why?

5500
02:46:54,370 --> 02:46:57,140
Why?

5501
02:46:54,830 --> 02:46:56,380
This isn't good, is it?

5502
02:46:55,610 --> 02:46:57,030
This sucks

5503
02:46:57,140 --> 02:46:59,140
Right?

5504
02:46:57,140 --> 02:47:00,910
This school leader is no good

5505
02:47:01,110 --> 02:47:05,110
It's because it's an Invincible Jacket!!

5506
02:47:02,200 --> 02:47:04,530
You say it's invincible, but

5507
02:47:04,790 --> 02:47:06,280
You aren't really using it well

5508
02:47:05,480 --> 02:47:09,260
It's bad

5509
02:47:06,320 --> 02:47:08,350
Using it like that is no good!!

5510
02:47:08,350 --> 02:47:10,160
The way I'm using it?

5511
02:47:09,240 --> 02:47:10,650
Tsukitei Hosei, you better shut the hell up already!!

5512
02:47:10,650 --> 02:47:11,970
Tsukitei Hosei, you better shut the hell up already!!

5513
02:47:11,970 --> 02:47:16,790
Tsukitei Hosei, you better shut the hell up already!!

5514
02:47:17,270 --> 02:47:17,860
What was that?

5515
02:47:18,240 --> 02:47:19,880
Something about Hosei

5516
02:47:20,270 --> 02:47:23,530
Delinquent Girl Detective

5517
02:47:20,270 --> 02:47:23,530
Minamino Yoko

5518
02:47:20,270 --> 02:47:23,530
TN: Minamino Yoko is the actress playing the same role in the series "Sukeban Deka" which translates to "Delinquent Girl Detective".

5519
02:47:24,900 --> 02:47:28,170
Holy crap, it's the Delinquent Girl Detective!!

5520
02:47:26,060 --> 02:47:27,350
Everyone sit your asses down!

5521
02:47:28,170 --> 02:47:28,790
Wow!

5522
02:47:30,330 --> 02:47:31,400
It's Delinquent Girl Detective!

5523
02:47:31,540 --> 02:47:36,080
T/N: This was her actual dialog in the original Sukeban Deka show.

5524
02:47:31,540 --> 02:47:36,080
With an iron mask hiding his face for 17 years

5525
02:47:36,080 --> 02:47:42,150
Surviving with only the skin on his back,

5526
02:47:38,680 --> 02:47:42,150
this is the fate of the police's minions

5527
02:47:42,150 --> 02:47:42,690
But

5528
02:47:43,920 --> 02:47:48,020
Even for someone like me,

5529
02:47:44,790 --> 02:47:48,020
I haven't forgotten about the precious things I love!!

5530
02:47:48,030 --> 02:47:51,490
I am the second Delinquent Girl Detective, Asamiya Saki!!

5531
02:47:52,300 --> 02:47:58,230
Throwing away love, taking advantage of the weakness of others' hearts:

5532
02:47:55,970 --> 02:47:58,230
The scoundrel Tsukitei Hosei!!

5533
02:47:58,240 --> 02:48:01,200
Your ass is unforgivable!!

5534
02:48:00,700 --> 02:48:01,190
That's right

5535
02:48:02,800 --> 02:48:04,130
She got it out

5536
02:48:03,660 --> 02:48:04,690
Wow, it's the real deal!

5537
02:48:03,660 --> 02:48:08,400
T/N: That is her detective's badge/yoyo, identical to the one from the show.

5538
02:48:08,400 --> 02:48:09,230
Wow

5539
02:48:10,080 --> 02:48:11,780
She was right in the center of our generation

5540
02:48:11,350 --> 02:48:17,020
Delinquent Girl Detective's Objective

5541
02:48:11,350 --> 02:48:17,020
Judge the evil deeds of Hosei

5542
02:48:11,780 --> 02:48:14,180
He really did

5543
02:48:18,740 --> 02:48:20,880
Yeah, that's why it's crazy

5544
02:48:20,930 --> 02:48:22,570
That's right

5545
02:48:21,030 --> 02:48:23,860
You used violence!!

5546
02:48:22,620 --> 02:48:23,850
Violence? But...

5547
02:48:23,850 --> 02:48:24,820
Well, here she comes

5548
02:48:24,910 --> 02:48:27,930
Sub-human scum, Tsukitei Hosei

5549
02:48:27,930 --> 02:48:30,460
This time I'm sending you straight to hell!!

5550
02:48:30,470 --> 02:48:30,930
This is a final act of pity!!

5551
02:48:30,940 --> 02:48:32,470
This is a final act of pity!!

5552
02:48:32,610 --> 02:48:38,900
So that you may rest in peace

5553
02:48:36,180 --> 02:48:38,900
I'll allow you to eat your favorite food

5554
02:48:39,500 --> 02:48:42,440
What's your favorite food?  TELL ME!!

5555
02:48:43,620 --> 02:48:45,440
Sweet and sour pork, please

5556
02:48:45,990 --> 02:48:48,580
SWEET AND SOUR PORK!?

5557
02:48:49,390 --> 02:48:53,250
With an iron mask hiding his face for 17 years

5558
02:48:53,260 --> 02:48:55,720
Surviving with only the skin on his back

5559
02:48:55,730 --> 02:49:03,830
The hellish monologue loops endlessly

5560
02:48:55,970 --> 02:48:57,290
This is the fate of police's minions

5561
02:49:00,300 --> 02:49:03,340
Even for someone like me, I haven't forgotten about the precious things I love

5562
02:49:03,840 --> 02:49:07,330
The 2nd Delinquent Girl Detective, Asamiya Saki!!

5563
02:49:08,440 --> 02:49:12,640
Always fumbling away with his beginner level Rakugo,

5564
02:49:10,240 --> 02:49:12,640
filling only his own belly with sweet and sour pork!!

5565
02:49:12,650 --> 02:49:15,890
Using the traditional arts... You great swindler, Tsukitei Hosei!

5566
02:49:15,890 --> 02:49:17,390
Using the traditional arts... You great swindler, Tsukitei Hosei!

5567
02:49:17,390 --> 02:49:18,540
Using the traditional arts... You great swindler, Tsukitei Hosei!

5568
02:49:18,550 --> 02:49:21,850
Your ass is unforgivable!!

5569
02:49:23,080 --> 02:49:24,440
What the hell...

5570
02:49:35,020 --> 02:49:41,570
Extending my authority as the legendary delinquent leader,

5571
02:49:38,700 --> 02:49:41,570
sub-human scum, Tsukitei Hosei

5572
02:49:46,270 --> 02:49:50,790
This "Justice Yoyo" will send you to hell

5573
02:49:49,540 --> 02:49:53,150
Phbt

5574
02:49:53,080 --> 02:49:54,110
I hoped you would've finished it

5575
02:49:55,180 --> 02:49:56,330
You really held out!

5576
02:49:56,710 --> 02:49:58,750
Amazingly blunt

5577
02:49:58,760 --> 02:50:01,150
Asamiya-san, please keep it smooth

5578
02:50:03,730 --> 02:50:08,930
Asamiya-san, that blunt delivery...

5579
02:50:04,810 --> 02:50:05,260
Right?

5580
02:50:06,350 --> 02:50:08,410
I thought that my...

5581
02:50:08,970 --> 02:50:10,840
UGH! We're getting nowhere!

5582
02:50:10,840 --> 02:50:12,070
For you,

5583
02:50:12,070 --> 02:50:15,670
This climax is befitting for someone like you!

5584
02:50:15,670 --> 02:50:22,040
Thai Kick for the Evil Hosei

5585
02:50:19,560 --> 02:50:20,710
Why is he here?

5586
02:50:21,450 --> 02:50:22,240
But she was saying

5587
02:50:22,220 --> 02:50:23,720
In my place,

5588
02:50:23,720 --> 02:50:25,540
This man will give you what you deserve!!

5589
02:50:25,640 --> 02:50:26,060
Iron mask

5590
02:50:27,020 --> 02:50:29,180
UWAAAAAA!!!!!!

5591
02:50:29,270 --> 02:50:37,140
Current World Champion Nasukawa Tenshin

5592
02:50:29,270 --> 02:50:37,140
T/N: Nasukawa Tenshin is the current Rizin Kickboxing featherweight world champion, as well as former Rizin bantamweight champion, and 2017 Rizin kickboxing flyweight tournement champion.

5593
02:50:29,270 --> 02:50:37,140
Thai Kick Enforcer

5594
02:50:30,270 --> 02:50:36,880
No way! Wait! Wait! Stop! This isn't the usual guy!!

5595
02:50:31,100 --> 02:50:31,980
It's Tenshin!

5596
02:50:37,140 --> 02:50:39,940
You're not... WAIT!!

5597
02:50:37,270 --> 02:50:38,320
Don't move so much

5598
02:50:37,790 --> 02:50:39,830
Don't thrash around!

5599
02:50:41,020 --> 02:50:43,690
It'll be the same, it's just that he's Tenshin

5600
02:50:41,340 --> 02:50:46,560
Don't fight back

5601
02:50:43,850 --> 02:50:48,180
WAIT WAIT!!

5602
02:50:46,930 --> 02:50:52,310
Relax, don't move around too much, it'll make it worse

5603
02:50:48,180 --> 02:50:49,880
Don't move around

5604
02:50:50,870 --> 02:50:52,290
It won't go well

5605
02:50:54,440 --> 02:50:57,110
Wait wait, no... No...

5606
02:50:57,360 --> 02:51:00,430
NOOO PLEASE WAIT!! I'm scared, what are you doing?!

5607
02:51:00,190 --> 02:51:02,740
Hosei! I'll send you to hell!!

5608
02:51:00,720 --> 02:51:01,340
Yes!

5609
02:51:03,140 --> 02:51:05,130
OOwwowwowwowwwowow!!!

5610
02:51:05,130 --> 02:51:06,320
I'll send you to hell!

5611
02:51:06,790 --> 02:51:09,300
OOwwowwowwowwwowow!!!

5612
02:51:11,640 --> 02:51:14,040
Well, let's go now

5613
02:51:15,390 --> 02:51:15,810
Ow

5614
02:51:17,120 --> 02:51:20,350
Look Tanaka, this is it!!

5615
02:51:20,870 --> 02:51:21,880
This is the real thing

5616
02:51:21,950 --> 02:51:22,640
That hurts

5617
02:51:23,650 --> 02:51:24,540
Oh it hurts

5618
02:51:24,690 --> 02:51:26,330
This had to hurt

5619
02:51:26,430 --> 02:51:27,250
Definitely painful

5620
02:51:26,870 --> 02:51:29,330
Wow, that really was something

5621
02:51:28,630 --> 02:51:33,360
He's a current world champion after all

5622
02:51:29,540 --> 02:51:30,430
That was good!

5623
02:51:30,310 --> 02:51:31,880
He tore you up!

5624
02:51:36,560 --> 02:51:37,300
That's just...

5625
02:51:37,600 --> 02:51:40,470
He's torn up!!

5626
02:51:40,520 --> 02:51:42,260
ow ow ow ow ow

5627
02:51:43,040 --> 02:51:45,870
Tanaka would get right up afterwards, though

5628
02:51:45,320 --> 02:51:47,130
He'd just casually get up like nothing

5629
02:51:47,410 --> 02:51:48,900
Are you okay?

5630
02:51:48,020 --> 02:51:49,520
See? See? He can't get up

5631
02:51:49,520 --> 02:51:50,910
Tanaka would already be standing up by now

5632
02:51:50,940 --> 02:51:53,800
Honestly, even I wouldn't be able to stand after that. I understand how you feel

5633
02:51:53,410 --> 02:51:54,310
Where does it hurt?

5634
02:51:54,740 --> 02:51:58,040
Honestly... My... Uh...

5635
02:51:58,760 --> 02:52:03,720
My asshole area really hurts...

5636
02:52:01,700 --> 02:52:06,310
Your asshole region hurts, huh? But take off the jacket, and heal your heart

5637
02:52:06,530 --> 02:52:07,820
Right, that's right

5638
02:52:08,190 --> 02:52:11,490
You need to change out of that and change yourself too

5639
02:52:08,860 --> 02:52:10,210
That's what got you kicked

5640
02:52:10,860 --> 02:52:11,600
Ah ow

5641
02:52:11,660 --> 02:52:13,770
What's with this invincibility stuff?

5642
02:52:13,860 --> 02:52:15,670
Oh I haven't gone yet

5643
02:52:15,350 --> 02:52:16,020
No, you haven't

5644
02:52:19,340 --> 02:52:22,440
Key to Locker #27

5645
02:52:19,750 --> 02:52:21,220
They've all been lockers, right?

5646
02:52:22,450 --> 02:52:26,040
It's that big sucker there

5647
02:52:23,070 --> 02:52:24,140
They all have been

5648
02:52:24,340 --> 02:52:25,960
This drawer series

5649
02:52:27,910 --> 02:52:31,560
Tanaka, that's no good, if you're able to get up and walk around that quickly...

5650
02:52:30,860 --> 02:52:33,520
That's the willpower of a professional

5651
02:52:34,990 --> 02:52:36,890
Ahhh again!!

5652
02:52:36,900 --> 02:52:41,490
Mysterious pouch

5653
02:52:36,970 --> 02:52:38,100
It's this pattern

5654
02:52:37,360 --> 02:52:39,260
I'm through with this pattern

5655
02:52:39,150 --> 02:52:40,790
It's scary!

5656
02:52:39,260 --> 02:52:40,590
What's in it?

5657
02:52:41,210 --> 02:52:42,490
A guillotine hood

5658
02:52:42,560 --> 02:52:42,970
Yes

5659
02:52:44,510 --> 02:52:45,580
That's a big drawstring

5660
02:52:45,840 --> 02:52:47,370
Tsk!!

5661
02:52:47,370 --> 02:52:49,670
The hell is this?

5662
02:52:52,880 --> 02:52:57,280
Funny Baby Gorilla Hamada Doll

5663
02:52:58,040 --> 02:53:01,220
They're all so great

5664
02:53:01,650 --> 02:53:03,520
They're really pushing this, aren't they

5665
02:53:02,620 --> 02:53:04,890
They're really great, even down to the delivery

5666
02:53:06,610 --> 02:53:08,860
They're all so good

5667
02:53:07,210 --> 02:53:09,340
They're really pushing this

5668
02:53:08,960 --> 02:53:11,140
Booo

5669
02:53:17,200 --> 02:53:20,170
Is the mechanism not obvious?

5670
02:53:20,170 --> 02:53:21,330
You squeeze it...?

5671
02:53:25,050 --> 02:53:26,010
It was so much

5672
02:53:30,920 --> 02:53:37,080
Baby Gorilla Hamada Doll

5673
02:53:30,920 --> 02:53:37,080
Lets out a yell when you squeeze his belly

5674
02:53:38,320 --> 02:53:43,560
With the Matsumoto one, what if you squeezed it really hard...

5675
02:53:40,790 --> 02:53:43,350
Ah, if you squeezed it really hard

5676
02:53:43,550 --> 02:53:44,860
Around the abs

5677
02:53:44,860 --> 02:53:47,460
Squeeze it as hard as you can and see...

5678
02:53:47,370 --> 02:53:47,810
Like this?

5679
02:54:05,440 --> 02:54:07,350
What the hell is that!!

5680
02:54:07,400 --> 02:54:08,610
I hate how high pitched it is

5681
02:54:08,620 --> 02:54:10,620
What is that even?

5682
02:54:10,640 --> 02:54:11,890
Seriously what is with that?

5683
02:54:14,050 --> 02:54:15,510
What is that?

5684
02:54:15,730 --> 02:54:17,530
Why was it so high?

5685
02:54:16,200 --> 02:54:18,560
The muscularity is probably why

5686
02:54:17,430 --> 02:54:19,810
I guess that's what you get when you squeeze too hard

5687
02:54:26,360 --> 02:54:27,960
Oh wait, it's still sunken in

5688
02:54:44,690 --> 02:54:47,690
I didn't realize!

5689
02:54:51,440 --> 02:54:52,700
So it's like that

5690
02:54:52,360 --> 02:54:53,550
Yeah it is

5691
02:54:53,100 --> 02:54:54,550
If you press it too much, then...

5692
02:54:54,200 --> 02:54:57,530
Like that, if you press too hard

5693
02:54:57,540 --> 02:54:59,770
I'm sure it's got its own sweet spot to it for sure

5694
02:54:58,850 --> 02:54:59,670
It does

5695
02:55:07,080 --> 02:55:08,510
You're really pushing it

5696
02:55:23,560 --> 02:55:26,630
It's manzai performed by Downtown

5697
02:55:31,680 --> 02:55:32,790
Downtown's manzai

5698
02:55:32,390 --> 02:55:34,050
What the hell is this

5699
02:55:40,030 --> 02:55:45,780
A popular man yells from the rooftop!!

5700
02:55:40,030 --> 02:55:45,780
Finally we're in the second half, a popular man yells from the rooftop

5701
02:55:45,800 --> 02:55:47,510
There's something I want to say!!

5702
02:55:47,790 --> 02:55:50,150
Huge Celebrity

5703
02:55:48,720 --> 02:55:51,920
Appearance!

5704
02:55:52,270 --> 02:55:56,150
8 hours of student life

5705
02:55:56,150 --> 02:55:58,990
There's no time for these five to rest

5706
02:55:58,380 --> 02:56:00,460
No I don't think so

5707
02:56:00,580 --> 02:56:00,940
Yeah

5708
02:56:02,690 --> 02:56:04,120
Everyone good?

5709
02:56:04,430 --> 02:56:07,790
For some reason there are students gathered outside,

5710
02:56:04,430 --> 02:56:07,790
it seems like something is going on

5711
02:56:07,800 --> 02:56:11,660
On the grounds they'll observe an event

5712
02:56:08,590 --> 02:56:09,780
That's vague!

5713
02:56:13,790 --> 02:56:14,920
This is really dumb

5714
02:56:14,530 --> 02:56:15,560
Seriously

5715
02:56:16,270 --> 02:56:17,840
Would be better to just go and then come back

5716
02:56:17,890 --> 02:56:19,700
You should go to the bathroom

5717
02:56:18,850 --> 02:56:19,710
I did

5718
02:56:19,760 --> 02:56:20,300
Oh you did?

5719
02:56:22,150 --> 02:56:26,880
Is the superintendent coming to this, too?

5720
02:56:24,550 --> 02:56:26,880
I wonder

5721
02:56:31,890 --> 02:56:33,150
What!?

5722
02:56:33,160 --> 02:56:36,660
I wonder how that asshole is getting home

5723
02:56:35,260 --> 02:56:36,660
I bet he's walkin'

5724
02:56:36,660 --> 02:56:42,960
The thugs that picked on Ito-kun in the bathroom

5725
02:56:38,670 --> 02:56:40,480
His face was hilarious!

5726
02:56:41,310 --> 02:56:42,880
That was so damn funny

5727
02:56:44,070 --> 02:56:47,270
They slapped him

5728
02:56:45,640 --> 02:56:46,410
Bullies?

5729
02:56:47,270 --> 02:56:50,740
They're really no good

5730
02:56:48,010 --> 02:56:49,660
Yeah, they were mean to Ito-san

5731
02:56:49,680 --> 02:56:50,670
Oh right

5732
02:56:52,310 --> 02:56:54,210
Someone's standing

5733
02:56:52,770 --> 02:56:54,100
Let's get closer

5734
02:56:54,120 --> 02:56:55,410
Huh?

5735
02:56:55,350 --> 02:56:56,730
What's going on?

5736
02:56:56,730 --> 02:56:57,240
Perhaps?

5737
02:56:57,150 --> 02:56:58,040
Who is it?

5738
02:56:58,350 --> 02:57:00,910
Ito-san...

5739
02:56:58,780 --> 02:56:59,360
What happened?

5740
02:57:01,750 --> 02:57:04,620
He's looking at something

5741
02:57:03,090 --> 02:57:04,620
So high up

5742
02:57:05,150 --> 02:57:06,550
It's put...

5743
02:57:06,870 --> 02:57:08,020
...so high up

5744
02:57:08,160 --> 02:57:10,690
Whoa it's his bicycle

5745
02:57:11,530 --> 02:57:13,660
That position is quite something

5746
02:57:14,400 --> 02:57:15,440
Really...

5747
02:57:16,690 --> 02:57:18,250
You're being bullied

5748
02:57:17,210 --> 02:57:17,940
They must've worked hard for it

5749
02:57:18,300 --> 02:57:19,730
That's why they were holding that thing

5750
02:57:19,430 --> 02:57:20,940
Right, the seat

5751
02:57:19,740 --> 02:57:21,000
They had the seat

5752
02:57:24,950 --> 02:57:27,890
I want to help somehow, but...

5753
02:57:27,670 --> 02:57:29,670
We can't really do anything

5754
02:57:29,160 --> 02:57:30,530
We can't reach it

5755
02:57:30,580 --> 02:57:32,840
Bullying is bad you guys

5756
02:57:31,890 --> 02:57:33,310
Of course

5757
02:57:32,020 --> 02:57:33,060
We know

5758
02:57:32,700 --> 02:57:34,020
We understand

5759
02:57:34,070 --> 02:57:35,870
We can't do anything about it

5760
02:57:36,660 --> 02:57:40,950
Shouldn't we call someone

5761
02:57:37,390 --> 02:57:40,950
to get that thing down from the tree?

5762
02:57:37,660 --> 02:57:39,370
We probably should

5763
02:57:39,380 --> 02:57:39,990
I agree

5764
02:57:42,030 --> 02:57:45,490
His pants also probably got taken...

5765
02:57:43,240 --> 02:57:43,890
Seems that way

5766
02:57:43,920 --> 02:57:45,090
They got his pants

5767
02:57:45,500 --> 02:57:48,590
They're already gathered.

5768
02:57:46,290 --> 02:57:47,270
Oh they are

5769
02:57:46,600 --> 02:57:48,590
Let's get going

5770
02:57:47,530 --> 02:57:47,980
It's true

5771
02:57:49,150 --> 02:57:49,940
What is that?

5772
02:57:50,420 --> 02:57:54,530
The students are watching the roof of the building

5773
02:57:51,060 --> 02:57:51,650
What's happening?

5774
02:57:52,140 --> 02:57:54,360
Okay guys, line up in front of everyone

5775
02:57:54,540 --> 02:57:56,370
Let's look at the roof

5776
02:57:56,500 --> 02:57:56,770
Yes, sir

5777
02:57:57,190 --> 02:57:57,990
Is something gonna come out?

5778
02:58:02,450 --> 02:58:11,050
Isileli Nakajima

5779
02:58:02,450 --> 02:58:11,050
Professional Japanese Rugby Player

5780
02:58:02,450 --> 02:58:11,050
T/N: Isileli is originally from Tonga, moved to Japan as a teenager, and his Japanese last name actually comes from his Japanese wife so his Japanese is not great and has a thick accent.

5781
02:58:05,340 --> 02:58:05,850
I'm First Year...

5782
02:58:06,810 --> 02:58:07,480
...Class 1...

5783
02:58:08,810 --> 02:58:10,320
Isileli Nakajima!

5784
02:58:11,060 --> 02:58:12,680
Wha-?

5785
02:58:13,930 --> 02:58:19,890
Omamegaoka High School Tradition

5786
02:58:13,930 --> 02:58:19,890
Students make assertions from the roof

5787
02:58:14,160 --> 02:58:15,120
There is something important...

5788
02:58:17,150 --> 02:58:19,380
...I have to say!

5789
02:58:20,150 --> 02:58:22,960
What is it?

5790
02:58:22,970 --> 02:58:27,330
Ever since I came to Japan

5791
02:58:27,340 --> 02:58:30,000
I've been a fan of Downtown

5792
02:58:30,010 --> 02:58:34,040
I even watch Gaki no Tsukai every time

5793
02:58:34,910 --> 02:58:36,440
We're very thankful

5794
02:58:36,450 --> 02:58:42,350
Especially, Silent Library, I love it!

5795
02:58:42,950 --> 02:58:44,920
Is that so?

5796
02:58:42,980 --> 02:58:44,520
Wow

5797
02:58:45,860 --> 02:58:49,390
But there is something

5798
02:58:47,690 --> 02:58:49,390
that bothers me

5799
02:58:49,390 --> 02:58:49,780
I see

5800
02:58:49,980 --> 02:58:53,090
What is it?

5801
02:58:53,100 --> 02:59:07,170
As soon as I bleached my hair, people started saying

5802
02:59:00,940 --> 02:59:07,170
"You look like him, you look like him" and compare me to Macchan

5803
02:59:07,180 --> 02:59:11,710
I'm not going for his look anyway

5804
02:59:11,720 --> 02:59:17,250
And besides, I am Tongan, born and raised

5805
02:59:17,260 --> 02:59:26,790
Now, I'll sing to you common happenings in Tonga,

5806
02:59:20,930 --> 02:59:26,790
in the melody of "Yesterday" by The Beatles

5807
02:59:26,800 --> 02:59:28,390
Really!?

5808
02:59:28,680 --> 02:59:41,240
Common happenings, I want to talk about common happenings in Tonga

5809
02:59:37,380 --> 02:59:41,240
Is that how the song goes?

5810
02:59:39,790 --> 02:59:41,130
It's a bit off isn't it?

5811
02:59:41,250 --> 02:59:48,880
He can't get the key for "Yesterday"

5812
02:59:41,250 --> 02:59:48,880
Omamegaoka High school Student's Assertion

5813
02:59:41,790 --> 02:59:42,430
Yesterday..

5814
02:59:44,050 --> 02:59:45,280
That's why we couldn't get it

5815
02:59:44,940 --> 02:59:46,460
He can't get the pitch

5816
02:59:49,050 --> 02:59:53,420
I want to say them

5817
02:59:50,990 --> 02:59:53,420

Happenings~ Tonga's common happenings~ I want to tell them

5819
03:00:06,240 --> 03:00:09,270
I can hear it,  a little

5820
03:00:09,270 --> 03:00:11,000
I don't hear it personally

5821
03:00:10,510 --> 03:00:10,940
Right...

5822
03:00:11,010 --> 03:00:13,410
"Yesterday" is not coming through

5823
03:00:12,140 --> 03:00:12,660
Right

5824
03:00:12,670 --> 03:00:13,990
I can't hear it

5825
03:00:13,480 --> 03:00:20,650

03:00:15,490 --> 03:00:16,210

You can say them now

5829
03:00:29,760 --> 03:00:31,820
Which part of "Yesterday" is this?

5830
03:00:31,880 --> 03:00:37,100
Tonga's common happenings~

5831
03:00:35,670 --> 03:00:36,630
What the hell is this

5832
03:00:37,200 --> 03:00:45,170
Bananas are usually fried~

5833
03:00:44,010 --> 03:00:45,080
Bananas are usually fried

5834
03:00:48,540 --> 03:00:49,450
That ain't something to cheer

5835
03:00:52,820 --> 03:00:55,730

5836
03:00:53,600 --> 03:00:55,090

There's more?

03:01:04,130 --> 03:01:05,520
There seems to be more

5842
03:01:10,000 --> 03:01:14,400

5845
03:01:12,050 --> 03:01:13,180

03:01:18,460 --> 03:01:21,070
What is it?

5848
03:01:21,080 --> 03:01:24,110
I'm going to use my courage to say the things

5849
03:01:24,120 --> 03:01:27,850
I always thought about in regards to everyone

5850
03:01:24,120 --> 03:01:27,850

5851
03:01:27,940 --> 03:01:30,220

03:01:31,020 --> 03:01:33,650

03:01:36,630 --> 03:01:40,790
Omamegaoka High school Student's Assertion

5855
03:01:36,630 --> 03:01:40,790
The true feelings of a child star

5856
03:01:36,660 --> 03:01:40,580

5864
03:01:55,210 --> 03:01:58,610
It's not Fuku-kun, it's Fuku-san to all of you!!

5865
03:02:01,020 --> 03:02:03,280
Fuku-san is pretty weird to say

5866
03:02:03,290 --> 03:02:06,450
Everybody treats me like I'm a kid

5867
03:02:06,460 --> 03:02:13,460
I'm already HAIRY DOWN THERE!!

5868
03:02:13,140 --> 03:02:14,140
That took some courage

5869
03:02:13,880 --> 03:02:14,750
It did

5870
03:02:17,890 --> 03:02:18,780
Right?

5871
03:02:21,250 --> 03:02:22,530
Well said well said

5872
03:02:23,720 --> 03:02:24,580

5877
03:02:27,000 --> 03:02:30,150

03:02:54,950 --> 03:02:56,930
As if I'd know anything about the details of the rules!

5892
03:02:57,810 --> 03:03:04,180
A while ago, I was told my comments

5893
03:03:02,380 --> 03:03:04,180
about the Japanese National Rugby Team were too weak

5894
03:03:04,250 --> 03:03:04,810
And then,

5895
03:03:05,920 --> 03:03:11,250

I've only been using that line!!

5898
03:03:14,730 --> 03:03:21,560
You think just by using the "School Wars" theme music

5899
03:03:18,730 --> 03:03:21,560
you can get away with anything

5900
03:03:21,570 --> 03:03:24,400

03:04:02,200 --> 03:04:08,580
I react to it. Hamada-san! I came to talk about you!

5916
03:04:02,740 --> 03:04:04,060
He reacts to it

5917
03:04:05,400 --> 03:04:06,560
He'll react to it

5918
03:04:08,580 --> 03:04:09,650
Oh really?

5919
03:04:09,650 --> 03:04:14,450
I will say everything that

5920
03:04:11,620 --> 03:04:14,450
I couldn't say until now

5921
03:04:13,580 --> 03:04:14,160
Okay

5922
03:04:14,450 --> 03:04:19,680
13 years ago, when I got to meet

5923
03:04:16,920 --> 03:04:19,680
Hamada-san for the first time

5924
03:04:20,690 --> 03:04:29,560
I was warned because of my weird tics

5925
03:04:20,690 --> 03:04:29,560
by my senpais, and it made me troubled

5926
03:04:30,240 --> 03:04:33,230
He can't help, but react

5927
03:04:30,420 --> 03:04:32,890
He reacted

5928
03:04:30,600 --> 03:04:33,130
His tic reacting

5929
03:04:30,600 --> 03:04:33,130
to the sound

5930
03:04:34,560 --> 03:04:35,850
Hemmingway, ocean view

5931
03:04:40,210 --> 03:04:41,510
THAT MAKES ME FORGET!!

5932
03:04:41,750 --> 03:04:44,980
When you make the sound, he can't help but react to it

5933

WHAT THE HELL ARE YOU DOING!!

5934
03:04:45,040 --> 03:04:46,910

5936
03:04:46,920 --> 03:04:50,250
13 years ago, when we first met

5937

I was worried about my tics acting out

5938
03:04:52,220 --> 03:04:55,120
I got warned by my senpais, and I was suffering

5939
03:04:55,760 --> 03:04:57,690
At that time Hamada-san told me

5940
03:04:57,700 --> 03:04:59,760
"How about you do it fully?

5941
03:04:59,760 --> 03:05:02,090
Afterwards, I'll take care of it and wipe your ass for you"

5942
03:04:59,760 --> 03:05:02,090
T/N: He doesn't mean this literally. Just means he'll clean up after any messes.

5943
03:05:02,100 --> 03:05:04,000
That's what you said to me

5944
03:05:04,600 --> 03:05:07,530

Don't jump! Please

5951
03:05:23,250 --> 03:05:26,790
Don't do it don't

5952
03:05:24,280 --> 03:05:27,730
What are you trying to say?

5953
03:05:24,800 --> 03:05:25,730
That would make you jump, I understand

5954
03:05:27,270 --> 03:05:28,620
Seriously, I don't know

5955
03:05:29,250 --> 03:05:30,610
You don't let me talk at all!

5956
03:05:31,340 --> 03:05:32,560
We don't get what you're getting at!

5957
03:05:33,080 --> 03:05:34,450
I'm trying to talk here

5958
03:05:34,830 --> 03:05:39,230
Truly thanks to Hamada-san I've come to where I am this day

03:06:43,700 --> 03:06:45,960
Shall we go greet him?

5997
03:06:45,960 --> 03:06:48,230
Student counselor...

5998
03:06:47,030 --> 03:06:48,220
Student counselor

5999
03:06:47,900 --> 03:06:50,470
I have a bad feeling..

6000
03:06:48,400 --> 03:06:56,510
Student counselor greeting

6001
03:06:48,400 --> 03:06:56,510
This school's ultra-important teacher

6002
03:06:50,770 --> 03:06:52,440
I've had enough of these scary people

6003
03:06:51,990 --> 03:06:53,260
Yeah...

6004
03:06:53,540 --> 03:06:54,740
There's a lot of them, right

6005
03:06:54,810 --> 03:06:55,170
Right!

6006
03:06:55,320 --> 03:06:56,190
Yes

6007
03:06:57,160 --> 03:06:58,010
Excuse us

6008
03:06:57,160 --> 03:07:02,720
Student counselor's office

6009
03:06:57,840 --> 03:06:58,590
Ah, so it's here

6010
03:06:59,910 --> 03:07:00,630
Excuse us

6011
03:07:00,730 --> 03:07:03,070
...Because the student counselor has an intimidating image

6012
03:07:03,120 --> 03:07:04,420
Could you line up here?

6013
03:07:05,330 --> 03:07:08,790
I have a bad feeling about this...

6014
03:07:07,320 --> 03:07:09,420
Something feels off...

6015
03:07:08,640 --> 03:07:09,190
Excuse me

6016
03:07:09,540 --> 03:07:11,720

03:07:15,630 --> 03:07:18,460
The newly joined employees... Ah! sorry-

6021
03:07:15,930 --> 03:07:16,760
The newly enrolled students are here

6022
03:07:16,760 --> 03:07:18,460
The newly enrolled students are here

6023
03:07:18,500 --> 03:07:21,030
May they introduce themselves?

6024
03:07:27,090 --> 03:07:28,540
They're all participating!

6025
03:07:28,670 --> 03:07:30,710
You can't be serious!

6026
03:07:30,740 --> 03:07:34,210
They're all participating?

6027
03:07:32,630 --> 03:07:33,880
Is that right?

6028
03:07:33,530 --> 03:07:34,600
Incredible

6029
03:07:34,210 --> 03:07:37,480
Shingo Katori

6030
03:07:34,210 --> 03:07:37,480
Student counselor

6031
03:07:34,210 --> 03:07:37,480
T/N: Shingo Katori is another member of SMAP. He's also won several awards for his acting roles in many different TV shows.

6032
03:07:34,800 --> 03:07:35,950
What the hell is going on?

6033
03:07:36,570 --> 03:07:37,400
Incredible

6034
03:07:41,700 --> 03:07:43,760
What is this...

6035
03:07:43,520 --> 03:07:44,870
Student counselor

6036
03:07:51,660 --> 03:07:52,100
What??

6037
03:07:51,660 --> 03:07:56,600
The student counselor has a really distinctive style

6038
03:07:52,280 --> 03:07:53,120
The hell are you doing?

6039
03:07:52,380 --> 03:07:56,150
Really?

6040
03:07:53,200 --> 03:07:55,020
What is that?

6041
03:07:56,250 --> 03:07:57,140
I don't get this

6042
03:07:57,220 --> 03:07:58,300
What are you doing?

6043
03:07:57,990 --> 03:07:59,020
I have no idea

6044
03:07:57,990 --> 03:07:59,020
Student counselor...

6045
03:07:59,020 --> 03:08:00,960
I don't get the concept!

6046
03:07:59,040 --> 03:08:04,710
A parody of Matsumoto's

6047
03:07:59,040 --> 03:08:04,710
legenday panty shot project

6048
03:07:59,350 --> 03:08:00,960
I really don't understand

6049
03:08:03,560 --> 03:08:04,560
No, the concept...

6050
03:08:07,080 --> 03:08:09,450
So you are the new students

6051
03:08:09,570 --> 03:08:09,900

6052
03:08:09,900 --> 03:08:10,220
Yes

6053
03:08:10,270 --> 03:08:10,480
Yes

6054
03:08:11,080 --> 03:08:14,820
Welcome to Heipo Omamegaoka High School

6055
03:08:20,290 --> 03:08:26,060
The personal apperance of the student counselor

6056
03:08:22,090 --> 03:08:22,530
He noticed

6057
03:08:26,430 --> 03:08:31,800
Playing the harmonica to welcome the new students

6058
03:08:27,070 --> 03:08:28,800
I will now welcome you properly

6059
03:08:53,160 --> 03:08:59,100
Stuffing the harmonica into his mouth

6060
03:08:59,780 --> 03:09:01,450
Yes yes, I get it

6061
03:09:01,900 --> 03:09:02,820
What

6062
03:09:02,550 --> 03:09:03,620
That's enough

6063
03:09:03,940 --> 03:09:08,640
Come on, tell us the concept!!

6064
03:09:09,060 --> 03:09:10,480
Tell us the concept

6065
03:09:10,110 --> 03:09:11,380
What are you doing?

6066
03:09:11,510 --> 03:09:12,540
What the hell are you doing?

6067
03:09:20,690 --> 03:09:22,200
Let us introduce each other

6068
03:09:22,840 --> 03:09:24,070
Starting with your name

6069
03:09:24,290 --> 03:09:33,870
1. Name

6070
03:09:24,290 --> 03:09:33,870
Self introduction

6071
03:09:24,810 --> 03:09:26,830
Your favorite girly mannerism

6072
03:09:26,860 --> 03:09:33,870
2. Favorite girly mannerism

6073
03:09:27,140 --> 03:09:29,910
And a line that you want a girl to say to you

6074
03:09:29,290 --> 03:09:33,870
3. A line you want a girl to say

6075
03:09:30,700 --> 03:09:33,100
Teacher Fujiwara, if you would start

6076
03:09:34,120 --> 03:09:35,250
Eh, Hiroshi Fujiwara

6077
03:09:36,370 --> 03:09:40,970
My favorite girly mannerism is

6078
03:09:38,470 --> 03:09:40,970
to put out their smoke in the cold soup of a used instant noodle cup

6079
03:09:41,810 --> 03:09:47,180
A line that I want a girl to say to me is

6080
03:09:43,760 --> 03:09:47,180
"You look good just wearing a T-shirt too, you know"

6081
03:09:47,330 --> 03:09:47,950
Nice to meet you

6082
03:09:51,500 --> 03:09:52,280
No no no

6083
03:09:52,280 --> 03:09:53,350
No, Fujiwara...

6084
03:10:00,990 --> 03:10:03,100
Next up is... you (Matsumoto)!!

6085
03:10:04,900 --> 03:10:06,420
My name is Hitoshi Matsumoto

6086
03:10:06,700 --> 03:10:09,670
My favorite girly mannerism is...

6087
03:10:11,400 --> 03:10:13,840
Well... If I had to pick right now, it'd be... When...

6088
03:10:13,840 --> 03:10:17,110
When they put their hair up in a ponytail

6089
03:10:23,230 --> 03:10:25,000
Isn't that correct?

6090
03:10:25,000 --> 03:10:26,820
No, not that kind of thing

6091
03:10:27,220 --> 03:10:27,970
Wait, why?

6092
03:10:27,570 --> 03:10:28,670
No no...

6093
03:10:28,820 --> 03:10:30,420
But it is just a personal preference

6094
03:10:37,130 --> 03:10:40,370
Do you know what our school's teaching principles might be?

6095
03:10:41,580 --> 03:10:43,470
I don't know

6096
03:10:41,620 --> 03:10:42,480
Sorry

6097
03:10:42,950 --> 03:10:43,490
Fujiwara left...

6098
03:10:43,770 --> 03:10:45,970
That. It's written here

6099
03:10:44,600 --> 03:10:46,840
Teaching principles

6100
03:10:47,370 --> 03:10:50,040
Ah, it's peeling off

6101
03:10:53,580 --> 03:10:56,980
We can see everything, teacher...

6102
03:10:59,950 --> 03:11:00,640
No, sorry...

6103
03:11:12,730 --> 03:11:15,270
Glance

6104
03:11:12,730 --> 03:11:15,270

Glance

6108
03:11:15,400 --> 03:11:17,440
You jerks. Why are you looking at my panties?

6109
03:11:18,100 --> 03:11:24,140
Looking at his panties is unforgivable

6110
03:11:18,100 --> 03:11:24,140
The licensed student counselor's way of life

6111
03:11:23,140 --> 03:11:24,040
You're looking even now, aren't you

Glance

6113
03:11:24,880 --> 03:11:28,210
You just looked, didn't you?

6114
03:11:27,130 --> 03:11:27,980
...I didn't

6115
03:11:28,580 --> 03:11:32,780
He should wear something just a little longer, don't you think...

6116
03:11:35,590 --> 03:11:38,290
Do you have a hobby?

6117
03:11:36,960 --> 03:11:39,060
My hobby is...

6118
03:11:39,560 --> 03:11:41,890
Scuba diving

6119
03:11:40,710 --> 03:11:41,690
Aaah...

6120
03:11:42,590 --> 03:11:44,600
And you?

6121
03:11:45,000 --> 03:11:48,430
Golf

6122
03:11:46,520 --> 03:11:47,200
Golf?

6123
03:11:47,270 --> 03:11:48,470
Yeah, I like golf

6124
03:11:48,970 --> 03:11:53,110
It was recommended to me by the Principal so I had no choice but to start

6125
03:11:53,110 --> 03:11:55,910
But I got totally addicted and ended up getting a complete set

6126
03:11:55,910 --> 03:11:58,180
His hobby, golf, was recommended by the principal

YOU WERE STRAIGHT UP LOOKING

6134
03:12:14,310 --> 03:12:15,460
No, I wouldn't say...

6135
03:12:16,040 --> 03:12:17,100
No no, it's your...

6136
03:12:17,000 --> 03:12:20,200
Teacher, our eyes just happen to look that way

6137
03:12:17,080 --> 03:12:19,410
Well, it is in plain sight so...

6138
03:12:20,220 --> 03:12:21,250
Hard not to see it

6139
03:12:20,700 --> 03:12:28,540
He really hates people looking at his panties

You can't really help seeing it, you know

6142

Yeah, even when you try not to look

6143
03:12:27,240 --> 03:12:28,410
A gentleman's sport!

6144
03:12:28,770 --> 03:12:31,510
Give it a shot (Endo)!!

6145
03:12:29,410 --> 03:12:30,040

Yeah, there

6150
03:12:38,520 --> 03:12:41,120

I beg you not to look anymore

Well, I guess...

6160

6181
03:13:11,230 --> 03:13:11,250
Pleeeaaase don't look anymore

6182
03:13:11,270 --> 03:13:13,440
Pleeeaaase don't look anymore

6183
03:13:13,720 --> 03:13:16,890
Give it a test swing (Hosei)!!

6184
03:13:14,520 --> 03:13:16,890
Eh?

6185
03:13:17,220 --> 03:13:22,360
Hosei doing a test shot

6186
03:13:17,820 --> 03:13:18,670
You haven't tried golf, have you?

6187
03:13:18,690 --> 03:13:19,760
No, I haven't tried it before

6188
03:13:19,840 --> 03:13:20,840
Please be careful

6189
03:13:24,530 --> 03:13:25,560
Give it all you've got!!

6190
03:13:25,610 --> 03:13:26,600
Watch the ball

6191
03:13:27,670 --> 03:13:30,140
Woah

6192
03:13:28,200 --> 03:13:29,000
Ah!

6193
03:13:28,200 --> 03:13:30,140
Ah!

6194
03:13:29,000 --> 03:13:30,140
What?

6195
03:13:30,140 --> 03:13:30,740
Watch the ball

6196
03:13:33,770 --> 03:13:35,770
WHAT ARE YOU DOING??

6197
03:13:33,770 --> 03:13:39,910
The string snapped and the ball flew through the wall

6198
03:13:40,810 --> 03:13:40,830
LOOK AT WHAT YOU HAVE DONE!!

6199
03:13:40,830 --> 03:13:40,850
LOOK AT WHAT YOU HAVE DONE!!

6200
03:13:40,850 --> 03:13:40,860
LOOK AT WHAT YOU HAVE DONE!!

6201
03:13:40,860 --> 03:13:40,880
LOOK AT WHAT YOU HAVE DONE!!

6202
03:13:40,880 --> 03:13:40,900
LOOK AT WHAT YOU HAVE DONE!!

6203
03:13:40,900 --> 03:13:40,930
LOOK AT WHAT YOU HAVE DONE!!

6204
03:13:40,930 --> 03:13:40,950
LOOK AT WHAT YOU HAVE DONE!!

6205
03:13:40,950 --> 03:13:40,960
LOOK AT WHAT YOU HAVE DONE!!

6206
03:13:40,960 --> 03:13:40,980
LOOK AT WHAT YOU HAVE DONE!!

6207
03:13:40,980 --> 03:13:41,000
LOOK AT WHAT YOU HAVE DONE!!

6208
03:13:41,000 --> 03:13:41,010
LOOK AT WHAT YOU HAVE DONE!!

6209
03:13:41,010 --> 03:13:41,030
LOOK AT WHAT YOU HAVE DONE!!

6210
03:13:41,030 --> 03:13:41,050
LOOK AT WHAT YOU HAVE DONE!!

6211
03:13:41,050 --> 03:13:41,080
LOOK AT WHAT YOU HAVE DONE!!

6212
03:13:41,080 --> 03:13:41,100
LOOK AT WHAT YOU HAVE DONE!!

6213
03:13:41,100 --> 03:13:41,110
LOOK AT WHAT YOU HAVE DONE!!

6214
03:13:41,110 --> 03:13:41,130
LOOK AT WHAT YOU HAVE DONE!!

6215
03:13:41,130 --> 03:13:41,150
LOOK AT WHAT YOU HAVE DONE!!

6216
03:13:41,150 --> 03:13:41,160
LOOK AT WHAT YOU HAVE DONE!!

6217
03:13:41,160 --> 03:13:41,180
LOOK AT WHAT YOU HAVE DONE!!

6218
03:13:41,180 --> 03:13:41,200
LOOK AT WHAT YOU HAVE DONE!!

6219
03:13:41,200 --> 03:13:41,210
LOOK AT WHAT YOU HAVE DONE!!

6220
03:13:41,210 --> 03:13:41,230
LOOK AT WHAT YOU HAVE DONE!!

6221
03:13:41,230 --> 03:13:41,250
LOOK AT WHAT YOU HAVE DONE!!

6222
03:13:41,250 --> 03:13:41,260
LOOK AT WHAT YOU HAVE DONE!!

6223
03:13:41,260 --> 03:13:41,280
LOOK AT WHAT YOU HAVE DONE!!

6224
03:13:41,280 --> 03:13:41,300
LOOK AT WHAT YOU HAVE DONE!!

6225
03:13:41,300 --> 03:13:41,310
LOOK AT WHAT YOU HAVE DONE!!

6226
03:13:41,310 --> 03:13:41,330
LOOK AT WHAT YOU HAVE DONE!!

6227
03:13:41,330 --> 03:13:41,350
LOOK AT WHAT YOU HAVE DONE!!

6228
03:13:41,350 --> 03:13:41,360
LOOK AT WHAT YOU HAVE DONE!!

6229
03:13:41,360 --> 03:13:42,750
LOOK AT WHAT YOU HAVE DONE!!

6230
03:13:43,750 --> 03:13:47,590
I thought there was a string

6231
03:13:45,450 --> 03:13:47,590
You looked again...

6232
03:13:46,540 --> 03:13:47,770
Eh, no... I...

6233
03:13:47,770 --> 03:13:50,220
You glanced just as the string snapped

6234
03:13:49,550 --> 03:13:55,630
He hates people looking at his panties so much he starts laughing

6235
03:13:49,550 --> 03:13:55,630
The licensed student counselor's way of life

6236
03:13:50,260 --> 03:13:51,190
No, I didn't

6237
03:13:51,860 --> 03:13:53,280
No no no, the ball pierced straight through the wall

6238
03:13:53,280 --> 03:13:55,130
Don't stare at my panties!!

6239
03:14:04,020 --> 03:14:08,610
Let's take a commemorative photo

6240
03:14:11,360 --> 03:14:12,580
A commemorative photo?

6241
03:14:14,130 --> 03:14:14,900
"Commemorative photo"

6242
03:14:18,050 --> 03:14:20,620
Maybe because you blew a hole in the wall

6243
03:14:20,900 --> 03:14:22,000
You take the picture

6244
03:14:20,920 --> 03:14:29,430
He wants to take a commemorative photo
like Matsumoto did

6245
03:14:24,390 --> 03:14:25,610
A proper camera

6246
03:14:27,740 --> 03:14:29,430
Where should we stand?

6247
03:14:29,430 --> 03:14:33,170
Just stand around me

6248
03:14:30,410 --> 03:14:30,850
Right now?

6249
03:14:31,710 --> 03:14:33,050
This is amazing

6250
03:14:34,300 --> 03:14:37,140
Ah, we should stand a little behind him

6251
03:14:35,270 --> 03:14:36,650
Ah, you're right

6252
03:14:38,440 --> 03:14:39,640
A-are you ready?

6253
03:14:39,220 --> 03:14:39,490
Yep

6254
03:14:39,640 --> 03:14:43,480
Ah, he's looking at my panties!!

6255
03:14:42,310 --> 03:14:43,440
No, please stop

6256
03:14:44,110 --> 03:14:46,180
I'm looking at all of you for the photo

6257
03:14:46,180 --> 03:14:49,110
You're definitely looking at my panties through the camera!!

6258
03:14:50,080 --> 03:14:53,120
You all just really want to look at my panties!!

6259
03:14:53,520 --> 03:14:55,520
Here! Here you go

6260
03:14:56,200 --> 03:14:58,710
No, it's not like that

6261
03:14:56,350 --> 03:14:58,890
We don't really want to look

6262
03:14:58,890 --> 03:14:59,670
Just take the picture

6263
03:14:59,010 --> 03:14:59,410
Look

6264
03:14:59,670 --> 03:15:00,510
Okay

6265
03:15:00,730 --> 03:15:01,060
Here, you bastards, look here

6266
03:15:01,060 --> 03:15:04,160
Here, you bastards, look here

6267
03:15:02,440 --> 03:15:03,480
I'm taking the picture

6268
03:15:03,700 --> 03:15:04,900
Not looking at him

6269
03:15:05,060 --> 03:15:06,460
Say "cheese"

6270
03:15:07,050 --> 03:15:10,000
Photo with the student counselor...

6271
03:15:07,700 --> 03:15:08,200
Thank you

6272
03:15:08,070 --> 03:15:09,130
Thank you

6273
03:15:09,370 --> 03:15:10,370
Let's go then

6274
03:15:10,940 --> 03:15:12,100
He gets really difficult when angry so let's go

6275
03:15:12,340 --> 03:15:12,750
Let's go back

6276
03:15:12,620 --> 03:15:13,440
What the hell

6277
03:15:14,170 --> 03:15:16,320
We didn't mean to anger him, but...

6278
03:15:15,110 --> 03:15:15,770
Glance

6279
03:15:16,510 --> 03:15:16,530
Ah, you stared again, didn't you!!

6280
03:15:16,530 --> 03:15:16,540
Ah, you stared again, didn't you!!

6281
03:15:16,540 --> 03:15:16,560
Ah, you stared again, didn't you!!

6282
03:15:16,560 --> 03:15:16,580
Ah, you stared again, didn't you!!

6283
03:15:16,580 --> 03:15:16,590
Ah, you stared again, didn't you!!

6284
03:15:16,590 --> 03:15:16,630
Ah, you stared again, didn't you!!

6285
03:15:16,630 --> 03:15:16,640
Ah, you stared again, didn't you!!

6286
03:15:16,640 --> 03:15:16,690
Ah, you stared again, didn't you!!

6287
03:15:16,690 --> 03:15:16,730
Ah, you stared again, didn't you!!

6288
03:15:16,730 --> 03:15:16,740
Ah, you stared again, didn't you!!

6289
03:15:16,740 --> 03:15:16,760
Ah, you stared again, didn't you!!

6290
03:15:16,760 --> 03:15:16,780
Ah, you stared again, didn't you!!

6291
03:15:16,780 --> 03:15:16,810
Ah, you stared again, didn't you!!

6292
03:15:16,810 --> 03:15:16,830
Ah, you stared again, didn't you!!

6293
03:15:16,830 --> 03:15:16,890
Ah, you stared again, didn't you!!

6294
03:15:16,890 --> 03:15:16,940
Ah, you stared again, didn't you!!

6295
03:15:16,940 --> 03:15:16,980
Ah, you stared again, didn't you!!

6296
03:15:16,980 --> 03:15:16,990
Ah, you stared again, didn't you!!

6297
03:15:16,990 --> 03:15:17,010
Ah, you stared again, didn't you!!

6298
03:15:17,010 --> 03:15:18,640
Ah, you stared again, didn't you!!

6299
03:15:17,160 --> 03:15:18,380
I didn't look, I swear!

6300
03:15:18,640 --> 03:15:21,650
Please excuse us!!

6301
03:15:19,980 --> 03:15:23,150
You just stared at my panties!!

6302
03:15:21,660 --> 03:15:22,600
This is taking unexpected turns

6303
03:15:22,610 --> 03:15:23,800
Yeah, it's all over the place

6304
03:15:23,800 --> 03:15:24,680
Crazy...

6305
03:15:24,920 --> 03:15:29,620
But... What about that hole?

6306
03:15:28,550 --> 03:15:29,620
Yeah, in the wall

6307
03:15:29,620 --> 03:15:32,060
When Endo did it there was a string, right...

6308
03:15:31,240 --> 03:15:31,890
Yeah, there was

6309
03:15:32,420 --> 03:15:35,490
Could you make a little way here?

6310
03:15:34,580 --> 03:15:35,490
Please make way! Coming through!

6311
03:15:35,490 --> 03:15:47,040
Please make way! Coming through!

6312
03:15:37,460 --> 03:15:43,670
School official being
carried out by emergency paramedics

6313
03:15:47,110 --> 03:15:50,980
There's really never a moment of rest, there's too much going on in this school

6314
03:15:51,790 --> 03:16:00,250
What tragedy just went down is still unknown to the 5 of them

6315
03:16:00,740 --> 03:16:06,190
The night has now completely engulfed them

6316
03:16:00,780 --> 03:16:06,230
10 hours into their school life

6317
03:16:07,000 --> 03:16:11,700
I'd really like it if the backrest leaned a little bit backwards

6318
03:16:11,700 --> 03:16:16,940
On the bullet train, are you one of those people that lower the backrest all the way down?

6319
03:16:14,310 --> 03:16:16,060
Ah, no not all the way down

6320
03:16:16,060 --> 03:16:18,160
The other day, it was the first time I experienced this, but...

6321
03:16:18,540 --> 03:16:22,350
There was this young woman sitting next to me...

6322
03:16:22,350 --> 03:16:23,280
I was sitting by the window

6323
03:16:25,780 --> 03:16:28,090
She took out her smartphone

6324
03:16:28,620 --> 03:16:30,240
And she plugged in the cable...

6325
03:16:29,720 --> 03:16:30,040
I see

6326
03:16:30,240 --> 03:16:31,720
But the outlet is over on this side, you know

6327
03:16:31,720 --> 03:16:33,410
On the armrest, yes

6328
03:16:31,720 --> 03:16:36,090
Bullet train outlets

6329
03:16:33,410 --> 03:16:34,630
There's an outlet

6330
03:16:34,830 --> 03:16:39,200
And she had the tray down and had her phone placed on the side

6331
03:16:39,730 --> 03:16:40,870
Watching a movie!!

6332
03:16:42,970 --> 03:16:44,570
What an extravaganza!!

6333
03:16:46,370 --> 03:16:47,610
The dependence on technology!!

6334
03:16:47,970 --> 03:16:50,930
Usually when you board the bullet train

6335
03:16:51,140 --> 03:16:56,610
I can't believe that you would already be running out of battery!!

6336
03:16:55,210 --> 03:16:55,700
That's right

6337
03:16:56,250 --> 03:16:56,560
Right?

6338
03:16:57,520 --> 03:17:01,550
You've never charged your phone on the bullet train?

6339
03:17:00,070 --> 03:17:03,690
No way because when you ride the bulle--

6340
03:17:00,870 --> 03:17:01,500
You don't?

6341
03:17:03,250 --> 03:17:05,390
You've already charged it

6342
03:17:04,260 --> 03:17:05,240
You have, right?

6343
03:17:05,390 --> 03:17:08,530
What were you doing yesterday?

6344
03:17:06,340 --> 03:17:08,040
What were you doing yesterday when you went to bed?

6345
03:17:08,530 --> 03:17:10,130
You charge yours on the bullet train, right?

6346
03:17:10,160 --> 03:17:10,500
Yes

6347
03:17:11,860 --> 03:17:15,770
You don't charge it the night before?

6348
03:17:12,050 --> 03:17:13,200
Only sometimes

6349
03:17:13,210 --> 03:17:14,300
That's right

6350
03:17:13,450 --> 03:17:15,750
I do, I do charge it the night before

6351
03:17:13,500 --> 03:17:14,300
Why don't you

6352
03:17:16,330 --> 03:17:19,770
It's fully charged as I wake up, but after a full day of activities

6353
03:17:20,070 --> 03:17:26,410
I charge it again around noon as I ride the bullet train

6354
03:17:24,060 --> 03:17:25,860
Will it deplete that fast?

6355
03:17:26,410 --> 03:17:29,810
You don't have any friends so I doubt you can deplete it!!

6356
03:17:28,560 --> 03:17:29,750
Don't have any friends?

6357
03:17:30,720 --> 03:17:32,980
You don't have any friends!!

6358
03:17:34,220 --> 03:17:36,220
What do you know about me?

6359
03:17:36,860 --> 03:17:38,690
Please stop the fighting

6360
03:17:40,530 --> 03:17:41,910
You don't have to be that mad

6361
03:17:41,010 --> 03:17:43,080
What the hell

6362
03:17:42,490 --> 03:17:44,480
However

6363
03:17:43,730 --> 03:17:44,980
It won't deplete that fast

6364
03:17:44,810 --> 03:17:46,720
I understand however

6365
03:17:47,030 --> 03:17:53,610
Even if it's at 78%, 100% makes it seem more functional...

6366
03:17:53,540 --> 03:17:54,940
That has nothing to do with it

6367
03:17:56,810 --> 03:17:59,780
It just seems better!!

6368
03:17:58,490 --> 03:17:59,440
No it doesn't

6369
03:17:59,780 --> 03:18:02,110
I don't charge it when it's at 78%

6370
03:18:00,930 --> 03:18:02,500
Lies lies

6371
03:18:02,510 --> 03:18:04,080
Not at 78%

6372
03:18:03,800 --> 03:18:05,430
I might think about it, but I won't do it

6373
03:18:05,430 --> 03:18:06,520
I don't from 78%

6374
03:18:06,520 --> 03:18:09,850
Do you mean that you've never charged it even once?

6375
03:18:10,360 --> 03:18:13,730
I don't ride the bullet train to charge my smartphone

6376
03:18:13,790 --> 03:18:17,560
I do it to charge myself...

6377
03:18:15,430 --> 03:18:16,680
You are freaking loud

6378
03:18:17,560 --> 03:18:20,530
Sorry!!

6379
03:18:21,230 --> 03:18:23,740
Say what?

6380
03:18:28,790 --> 03:18:31,880
It can't be helped, this is pointless

6381
03:18:34,800 --> 03:18:35,480
Seriously?

6382
03:18:35,480 --> 03:18:37,720

6383
03:18:39,720 --> 03:18:41,140

Everyone listen up

6652
03:29:10,480 --> 03:29:13,320
The parents and guardians have their

6653
03:29:11,880 --> 03:29:13,320
parents' meeting but

6654
03:29:13,320 --> 03:29:15,990
You all are students so it doesn't concern you, but

6655
03:29:15,990 --> 03:29:21,390
You understand the various problems at this school so...

6656
03:29:21,630 --> 03:29:25,860
If it doesn't concern us we don't have to go right?

6657
03:29:23,690 --> 03:29:27,670
Since you know the problems at this school, it'll be a learning opportunity

6658
03:29:27,470 --> 03:29:28,770
Why won't they smack him?

6659
03:29:28,800 --> 03:29:30,600
Say that one more time from the top!!

6660
03:29:29,630 --> 03:29:30,530
Yes, please

6661
03:29:30,970 --> 03:29:32,270

6662

6663
03:29:32,500 --> 03:29:33,840
Everyone listen up

6664
03:29:34,210 --> 03:29:38,780
Now, the parents will have their

6665
03:29:36,310 --> 03:29:38,780

6666
03:29:39,180 --> 03:29:43,610
You all are students so it doesn't really concern you, but

6667
03:29:43,780 --> 03:29:45,720
That's nonsense

6668
03:29:46,380 --> 03:29:48,470
"It doesn't concern you" should be left out

6669
03:29:48,550 --> 03:29:54,560
If that's the case, we don't have to go, and you don't even have to say the rest, but since you say it

6670
03:29:54,540 --> 03:29:55,160
Exactly

6671
03:29:55,180 --> 03:29:56,830
Then we're like, "Why do we have to go?"

6672
03:29:56,510 --> 03:29:58,000
Right

6673
03:29:58,230 --> 03:30:02,970
To get in touch with the school's problems they

6674
03:29:58,230 --> 03:30:02,970
observe a parents' meeting for some reason

6675
03:29:59,900 --> 03:30:01,950

Well then, let's move to the first topic of discussion

There has been a case of bullying in my class

6709
03:31:12,240 --> 03:31:14,870
Shinji Takeda

6710
03:31:12,240 --> 03:31:14,870
T/N: Shinji Takeda is an actor who is known for his roles in thriller movies like The Incite Mill, Kyo Kara Hitman, and Tokyo Eyes.

6711
03:31:12,240 --> 03:31:14,870
Teacher

6712
03:31:12,390 --> 03:31:13,690
She said to reveal the perpetrator

6713
03:31:14,870 --> 03:31:20,340
Tell me the names of the students who are in the same class

6714
03:31:17,510 --> 03:31:20,340
as my son Shiro, if you'd please

6715
03:31:20,340 --> 03:31:23,150
Those 5 are in the same class as him

6716
03:31:23,650 --> 03:31:25,720
Mr. Kobayashi who are these kids?

6717
03:31:26,380 --> 03:31:28,320
They are new students

6718
03:31:29,290 --> 03:31:35,360
Searching for the student who bullied her precious child

6719
03:31:39,760 --> 03:31:41,700
You (Matsumoto) stand please

6720
03:31:46,600 --> 03:31:49,470
You bullied Shiro right?

6721
03:31:47,960 --> 03:31:49,490
No I didn't, I don't know him

6722
03:31:49,470 --> 03:31:52,110
That's a lie!!

6723
03:31:50,520 --> 03:31:51,860
No, really, I don't know him

6724
03:31:52,110 --> 03:31:54,480
You really bullied Shiro!!

6725
03:31:53,760 --> 03:31:54,430
I really don't know him

6726
03:31:54,480 --> 03:31:58,420
Why do you needlessly train your body this much?! What's the meaning of it?

6727
03:31:54,780 --> 03:32:00,580
Mrs. Mizuno, please don't be so heavy-handed with the students

6728
03:32:00,620 --> 03:32:01,720
He gets that all the time

6729
03:32:01,720 --> 03:32:02,990
Takeda!!

6730
03:32:03,320 --> 03:32:06,290
You!! It's all because you're not doing your damn job!

6731
03:32:03,320 --> 03:32:07,630
The target of her anger turns to the head teacher

6732
03:32:08,630 --> 03:32:10,590
I intended to confront with all my students...

6733
03:32:13,000 --> 03:32:14,200
What is she doing?

6734
03:32:13,600 --> 03:32:15,530
Don't you dare talk back to me!

6735
03:32:16,430 --> 03:32:19,040
Do you get it, you asshole?!

6736
03:32:21,240 --> 03:32:27,780
The parent's anger becomes abnormal

6737
03:32:24,190 --> 03:32:27,760
[More unintelligible screaming]

6738
03:32:30,280 --> 03:32:32,750
Stand!!! Stand I say!!!

6739
03:32:35,390 --> 03:32:36,290
Mrs. Mizuno!?

6740
03:32:36,290 --> 03:32:38,520
Has she gone off the deep end?

6741
03:32:38,810 --> 03:32:40,520
That was so scary

6742
03:32:38,960 --> 03:32:40,860
Get out of here

6743
03:32:39,520 --> 03:32:41,110
That's insane

6744
03:32:45,800 --> 03:32:46,280
What?

6745
03:32:48,670 --> 03:32:51,670
Wait just a minute here, what even

6746
03:32:57,210 --> 03:32:58,140
Sorry

6747
03:32:58,140 --> 03:33:01,380
I lost my composure there

6748
03:32:58,960 --> 03:33:01,380
Oh, really? However, Mrs. Mizuno,

6749
03:33:01,580 --> 03:33:05,550
Your son, Shiro, is

6750
03:33:02,880 --> 03:33:05,550
quite a cheerful honors student so

6751
03:33:05,550 --> 03:33:08,790
it doesn't seem that his personality is very prone to bullying, but

6752
03:33:08,790 --> 03:33:11,560
Is there something about Shiro that has changed?

6753
03:33:11,860 --> 03:33:16,860
About Shiro... Has anything changed, indeed

6754
03:33:18,530 --> 03:33:20,970
Maybe Shiro worried about that

6755
03:33:25,040 --> 03:33:29,010
Remembering a certain day's incident

6756
03:33:25,700 --> 03:33:29,010
This kind of relationship isn't allowed, but I love you

6757
03:33:29,640 --> 03:33:31,610
It's been three years since I started cheating

6758
03:33:32,080 --> 03:33:34,430
Someday I want to be with you

6759
03:33:35,060 --> 03:33:38,400
I'll make sure my husband doesn't find out, and especially my son

6760
03:33:38,870 --> 03:33:41,020
Now in the school, Shiro...

6761
03:33:41,590 --> 03:33:43,490
Why are you here?

6762
03:33:43,900 --> 03:33:45,910
You say, who is this person?

6763
03:33:46,440 --> 03:33:49,010
If I'm going to say it, then your mother will be straight with you

6764
03:33:49,630 --> 03:33:53,030
Your mother has fallen in love with someone that has a wife and kids

6765
03:33:53,300 --> 03:33:56,150
In any case, I get chills because they have a wife and kids

6766
03:33:57,570 --> 03:33:59,500
I'd be lying if I said it wasn't scary

6767
03:34:00,400 --> 03:34:02,270
Even so, it's almost uncontrollable how much

6768
03:34:02,270 --> 03:34:05,280
I get aroused by a man with a happy family!

6769
03:34:08,160 --> 03:34:09,680
Even more than that,  Shiro!

6770
03:34:09,950 --> 03:34:12,700
Where are you going? Come back at once! Shiro!

6771
03:34:16,420 --> 03:34:19,060
Just raising Shiro right

6772
03:34:19,370 --> 03:34:21,680
Was my only happiness...

6773
03:34:28,870 --> 03:34:29,550
What is she doing?

6774
03:34:33,300 --> 03:34:34,990
What is she doing, really?

6775
03:34:40,340 --> 03:34:43,950
Hey what is this?!

6776
03:34:41,910 --> 03:34:43,950
That's pretty self-important coming from a fat cat like you!

6777
03:34:43,950 --> 03:34:47,850
Everyone knows!

6778
03:34:45,650 --> 03:34:47,850
You're dating a teacher right!

6779
03:34:47,850 --> 03:34:55,190
Bitter heckling from parents who can't put up with it any more

6780
03:34:48,500 --> 03:34:49,640
I am?

6781
03:34:49,640 --> 03:34:51,370
It's useless to play dumb!

6782
03:34:51,370 --> 03:34:55,190
Of course he gets bullied with a thoughtless mother like that!

6783
03:34:55,460 --> 03:34:56,660
What are you saying?

6784
03:34:56,660 --> 03:34:59,700
There's no way I'd be dating a teacher or

6785
03:34:56,660 --> 03:34:59,700
anything like that!!

6786
03:34:59,700 --> 03:35:02,500
You're all just

6787
03:35:01,100 --> 03:35:02,500
talking out of your asses!!

6788
03:35:02,500 --> 03:35:04,200
Miki

6789
03:35:04,200 --> 03:35:08,060
Enough already

6790
03:35:08,670 --> 03:35:11,680
Let's tell everyone honestly

6791
03:35:12,910 --> 03:35:13,830
What a ham

6792
03:35:12,910 --> 03:35:19,220
Her extramarital lover is, improbably, Fujiwara

6793
03:35:14,500 --> 03:35:15,550
Wait, what are you saying?

6794
03:35:16,060 --> 03:35:17,710
Wait, what

6795
03:35:19,220 --> 03:35:23,320
My relationship with you getting found out is fine with me

6796
03:35:23,320 --> 03:35:27,760
Love between a teacher and parent is prohibited

6797
03:35:27,760 --> 03:35:32,300
But I fell in love with you,

6798
03:35:30,190 --> 03:35:32,300
And I can't help it

6799
03:35:32,300 --> 03:35:34,200
Hiroshi

6800
03:35:34,200 --> 03:35:36,970
Your face, are you tired?

6801
03:35:36,970 --> 03:35:40,250
You too Hiroshi, these age spots, what will we ever do about them?

6802
03:35:40,270 --> 03:35:41,610
Eh-heh

6803
03:35:43,470 --> 03:35:50,950
I'll quit being a teacher.

6804
03:35:45,910 --> 03:35:50,950
I'm only a fraction of a man for not choosing to make you happy

6805
03:35:55,070 --> 03:35:56,140
He's only funny in moments like this

6806
03:35:57,150 --> 03:35:59,090
What is he on about?

6807
03:36:03,690 --> 03:36:04,290
Stop that

6808
03:36:04,190 --> 03:36:08,120
Last is COWCOW's trademark pose

6809
03:36:04,190 --> 03:36:08,120
T/N: COWCOW is a comedian duo who have won a few awards for their manzai.

6810
03:36:14,250 --> 03:36:15,490
Uhm.. Mizuno-sama

6811
03:36:15,710 --> 03:36:16,810
For today can't we...

6812
03:36:16,810 --> 03:36:18,980
That is not possible!!

6813
03:36:18,980 --> 03:36:21,550
I want to get things straight right here and now

6814
03:36:20,840 --> 03:36:21,960
That's inconvenient

6815
03:36:25,900 --> 03:36:27,650
Finally I foun' somebody

6816
03:36:27,650 --> 03:36:30,050
There she is

6817
03:36:27,950 --> 03:36:31,960
I be hearin' some noise and thinkin' "The hell is goin' on?"

6818
03:36:30,050 --> 03:36:33,840
Kazuo Nishio

6819
03:36:30,050 --> 03:36:33,840
Pizza Cap

6820
03:36:30,050 --> 03:36:33,840
Tomochika

6821
03:36:31,970 --> 03:36:33,610
That really dang surprised me

6822
03:36:34,220 --> 03:36:38,530
A pizza was ordered by someone

6823
03:36:35,260 --> 03:36:38,530
so I went to the staff room, but there ain't nobody there

6824
03:36:38,800 --> 03:36:41,830
You got me runnin' around like it's a

6825
03:36:39,630 --> 03:36:41,830
government office for heaven's sake

6826
03:36:41,830 --> 03:36:43,170
You get it right?

6827
03:36:42,520 --> 03:36:42,980
Oh...

6828
03:36:43,480 --> 03:36:46,050
There's gotta be someone who be orderin' a damn pizza here

6829
03:36:50,540 --> 03:36:51,280
We don't get it

6830
03:36:53,790 --> 03:36:54,310
That hurts!

6831
03:36:55,650 --> 03:36:57,680
You set it up real nice

6832
03:36:57,680 --> 03:36:59,420
Make it a medium size

6833
03:36:59,420 --> 03:37:00,950
You put them corn on top of the seafood

6834
03:37:00,950 --> 03:37:02,690
You put them corn on top of the seafood

6835
03:37:03,090 --> 03:37:05,460
Get some chicken cover'em up in wheat flour to fry'em

6836
03:37:05,460 --> 03:37:08,930
It'll be trouble if I go back with no money

6837
03:37:12,400 --> 03:37:13,330
That hurts so much

6838
03:37:15,470 --> 03:37:16,520
And you ma'am

6839
03:37:16,530 --> 03:37:19,140
If you keep screeching like that

6840
03:37:17,800 --> 03:37:19,140
Your blood pressure'll go through the roof

6841
03:37:19,140 --> 03:37:20,870
You get check-ups regularly?

6842
03:37:20,870 --> 03:37:23,110
It has nothing to do with you

6843
03:37:22,040 --> 03:37:23,110
Ain't no way it's got nothin' to do with me

6844
03:37:23,110 --> 03:37:26,180
Even them kids of yours should go

6845
03:37:24,210 --> 03:37:26,180
Get check-ups from the doc too

6846
03:37:26,180 --> 03:37:29,410
Some kids been gettin' stool examinations

6847
03:37:27,840 --> 03:37:29,410
And such, I'm sure

6848
03:37:29,410 --> 03:37:30,310
Goin' "I'm constipated" "I'm constipated"

6849
03:37:30,310 --> 03:37:31,850
Goin' "I'm constipated" "I'm constipated"

6850
03:37:31,850 --> 03:37:32,780
Bringin' their parents' or their siblings' shit too

6851
03:37:32,780 --> 03:37:34,350
Bringin' their parents' or their siblings' shit too

6852
03:37:34,350 --> 03:37:37,370
That's your parents' n siblings' inspection!!

6853
03:37:44,650 --> 03:37:45,100
That hurts!

6854
03:37:46,800 --> 03:37:47,980
It hurts

6855
03:37:48,180 --> 03:37:50,200
Properly go to your doc n' get them checkups

6856
03:37:50,220 --> 03:37:51,050
What happened...

6857
03:37:51,240 --> 03:37:53,600
Ain't your lymphs nodes a bit swollen?

6858
03:37:53,620 --> 03:37:54,120
Wha-

6859
03:37:55,210 --> 03:37:55,920
You yo-

6860
03:37:56,170 --> 03:37:58,340
You saw the physical assault right?

6861
03:37:58,340 --> 03:37:59,380
We're going to the police box, someone dial 110

6862
03:37:58,340 --> 03:38:01,250
T/N: 110 is Japan's emergency police number.

6863
03:37:59,380 --> 03:38:01,250
We're going to the police box, someone dial 110

6864
03:38:01,250 --> 03:38:02,180
That's fine by me, I'll crush you with money

6865
03:38:02,180 --> 03:38:03,980
That's fine by me, I'll crush you with money

6866
03:38:03,450 --> 03:38:05,180
We'll get this settled with 110!

6867
03:38:05,420 --> 03:38:06,380
That's fine by me

6868
03:38:07,900 --> 03:38:10,450
I'm very sorry about that, uhm...

6869
03:38:10,450 --> 03:38:11,220
Moving on

6870
03:38:11,890 --> 03:38:13,620
The teachers' adultery problem is next

6871
03:38:13,620 --> 03:38:15,760
The teachers' adultery problem is next

6872
03:38:15,760 --> 03:38:20,560
There seems to be an explanation and apology to be given by the cheating party...

6873
03:38:16,060 --> 03:38:23,070
An explanation and apology by the teacher that caused the adultery issue

6874
03:38:20,560 --> 03:38:21,750
...we'll bring them in

6875
03:38:21,750 --> 03:38:22,580
Come in!

6876
03:38:25,400 --> 03:38:29,370
Ryuji Harada

6877
03:38:25,400 --> 03:38:29,370
T/N: Ryuji Harada is an actor who was caught cheating with multiple women.

6878
03:38:25,400 --> 03:38:29,370
The cheating teacher

6879
03:38:40,150 --> 03:38:41,820
As expected right?

6880
03:38:40,950 --> 03:38:42,100
Right?

6881
03:38:42,220 --> 03:38:43,200
Uhm, with that...

6882
03:38:43,220 --> 03:38:47,540
We have gathered some

6883
03:38:44,320 --> 03:38:47,540
Of the guardians' questions beforehand

6884
03:38:47,540 --> 03:38:49,140
Professor Harada please answer them honestly

6885
03:38:49,380 --> 03:38:49,940
Yes

6886
03:38:50,190 --> 03:38:51,780
This is the first question

6887
03:38:52,260 --> 03:38:56,880
How did you meet your mistress?

6888
03:38:55,820 --> 03:39:03,840
Meeting method with their mistress?

6889
03:38:58,870 --> 03:39:00,500
On Instagram, through DMs

6890
03:39:00,500 --> 03:39:03,840
On Instagram, through DMs

6891
03:39:03,840 --> 03:39:04,890
The next question

6892
03:39:05,490 --> 03:39:07,860
Why did you use Instagram?

6893
03:39:05,730 --> 03:39:15,620
Reason for using Instagram

6894
03:39:09,380 --> 03:39:11,920
Since Instagram is mainly pictures

6895
03:39:11,920 --> 03:39:13,280
By looking at their pictures I can be sure of their identity

6896
03:39:13,280 --> 03:39:15,620
By looking at their pictures I can be sure of their identity

6897
03:39:15,900 --> 03:39:18,060
People who cheat are scum!!

6898
03:39:18,060 --> 03:39:21,020
And to use social networks, absolutely disgusting!!

6899
03:39:18,060 --> 03:39:22,460
The couple Megumi Kaneko and Kensuke Miyazaki are in the audience

6900
03:39:18,060 --> 03:39:24,460
T/N: Kensuke Miyazaki was a politician who cheated on his wife with a gravure idol while his wife was prematurely giving birth. The woman next to him is his wife, Megumi Kaneko and they are still married despite the affair.

6901
03:39:28,170 --> 03:39:30,000
You're the one to talk?!

6902
03:39:33,400 --> 03:39:36,040
How can he say that with a straight face?

6903
03:39:36,040 --> 03:39:36,760
Next question

6904
03:39:36,810 --> 03:39:40,330
Where and for how long did you cheat?

6905
03:39:39,160 --> 03:39:44,820
Location and duration

6906
03:39:42,510 --> 03:39:43,680
Inside a 4-wheel-drive car for 10 minutes

6907
03:39:43,680 --> 03:39:44,820
Inside a 4-wheel-drive car for 10 minutes

6908
03:39:44,820 --> 03:39:46,280
10 minutes!? That's disrespectful to the woman!!

6909
03:39:46,280 --> 03:39:47,950
10 minutes!? That's disrespectful to the woman!!

6910
03:39:47,950 --> 03:39:50,750
Isn't that rude to your wife in the first place!!

6911
03:39:50,090 --> 03:39:52,220
That's you!!

6912
03:39:56,080 --> 03:39:58,380
There's so much going on...

6913
03:39:59,960 --> 03:40:00,880
It's too congested

6914
03:40:00,900 --> 03:40:01,350
That hurts!

6915
03:40:02,670 --> 03:40:06,070
It's the adultery all-stars

6916
03:40:05,250 --> 03:40:06,070
RESIGN NOW!

6917
03:40:06,070 --> 03:40:08,670
Do you actually feel bad? Yeah! That's right! Quit already!

6918
03:40:08,670 --> 03:40:09,770
Everyone please quiet down

6919
03:40:09,770 --> 03:40:11,880
Everyone please quiet down

6920
03:40:12,060 --> 03:40:14,580
THIS KIND OF TEACHER

6921
03:40:12,930 --> 03:40:14,580
NEEDS TO BE FIRED!!

6922
03:40:18,590 --> 03:40:21,410

6925
03:40:22,710 --> 03:40:24,010
They're all here

6926
03:40:24,490 --> 03:40:25,980
It's the all-stars

6927
03:40:29,180 --> 03:40:31,920
Is it the legendary all-star battle?

6928
03:40:31,920 --> 03:40:38,120
ADULTERY IS

6929
03:40:33,180 --> 03:40:38,120
AN ACT THAT SHOULD NEVER BE FORGIVEN!!

6930
03:40:40,420 --> 03:40:42,580
You're just getting in the way

6931
03:40:43,540 --> 03:40:45,360
Well, that can't be helped

6932

6933
03:40:46,410 --> 03:40:47,710

6934
03:40:48,450 --> 03:40:49,770
Sorry, I'm getting in the way

6935
03:40:50,630 --> 03:40:52,770
OI YOU 4-WHEEL-DRIVE BASTARD!!!

6936
03:40:53,400 --> 03:40:55,670
WHAT DO YOU THINK YOU'LL ACCOMPLISH STANDING THERE!?

6937
03:40:53,440 --> 03:40:58,840
The angry guardians are closing in on the cheating teacher

6938
03:40:56,320 --> 03:40:58,230
SAY SOMETHING YOU PUNK!!

6939
03:40:58,980 --> 03:41:01,560
THAT'S ENOUGH!!

6940
03:41:02,780 --> 03:41:06,650
This is a place for children to learn,

6941
03:41:04,380 --> 03:41:06,650
don't go swinging that around!!

6942
03:41:06,650 --> 03:41:07,850
Please, can you just let this go?

6943
03:41:07,850 --> 03:41:08,820
Please, can you just let this go?

6944
03:41:08,820 --> 03:41:09,390
Shut the hell up!!

6945
03:41:09,390 --> 03:41:10,820

LET'S GO!!

6948
03:41:25,890 --> 03:41:26,900
"Let's go!!"?

In front of me is a metal pipe-holding dangerous person

6956
03:41:41,490 --> 03:41:43,490

6962
03:41:57,180 --> 03:41:59,070
And as a human, I hit rock bottom

6963
03:41:59,270 --> 03:42:01,070
But thanks to Harada-san, I was saved

6964
03:42:01,070 --> 03:42:03,610
But thanks to Harada-san, I was saved

6965
03:42:03,840 --> 03:42:06,810
TV dramas have started giving me offers once again

6966
03:42:07,210 --> 03:42:08,400
Using the APA affair incident to be able to eat again

6967
03:42:08,400 --> 03:42:09,610
Using the APA affair incident to be able to eat again

6968
03:42:09,610 --> 03:42:12,150
Using the APA affair incident to be able to eat again

6969
03:42:12,850 --> 03:42:14,000
I don't feel moved by this at all though

6970
03:42:14,280 --> 03:42:19,390
Harada-san, you can also

6971
03:42:16,120 --> 03:42:19,390
get naked and start over!!

6972
03:42:28,970 --> 03:42:32,340
GO!!

6973
03:42:39,310 --> 03:42:45,550
A very urgent transformation has begun

You not even complete

6981
03:43:15,260 --> 03:43:17,050
Can you wait for a bit?

6982
03:43:17,350 --> 03:43:22,000
He realizes his mistake and leaves the scene for a moment

6983
03:43:21,220 --> 03:43:22,300
What's wrong?

6984
03:43:22,790 --> 03:43:24,470
Did he forget something?

6985
03:43:25,020 --> 03:43:27,090
It came from over there though

6986
03:43:28,170 --> 03:43:32,000
They missed each other

6987
03:43:30,280 --> 03:43:32,450
Harada-kun, it's over there

6988
03:43:32,660 --> 03:43:35,120
That side

6989
03:43:35,880 --> 03:43:37,320
What the hell...

6990
03:43:38,700 --> 03:43:40,290
Why the hell

6991
03:43:46,580 --> 03:43:47,430
It hurts

6992
03:43:47,810 --> 03:43:49,110
Attack them!!

6993
03:43:49,300 --> 03:43:51,210

6994
03:43:51,210 --> 03:43:54,430

IT HURTS IT HURTS

6996
03:43:55,690 --> 03:44:00,620
The allies of justice lose in an instant

6997
03:43:56,640 --> 03:43:57,340
Damnit!

6998
03:43:58,720 --> 03:44:00,460
This is such an embarrasing circumstance

6999
03:44:01,360 --> 03:44:03,090
We can't go up against them on our own

7000
03:44:03,330 --> 03:44:04,440
Are we giving up...?

You came to help!

7011
03:44:23,350 --> 03:44:26,580
This year's offer

7012
03:44:24,380 --> 03:44:26,580
was hard for me to accept since I'm in the middle of my second hiatus

7013
03:44:26,580 --> 03:44:27,600
But compared to the two of you, the front of the material was made wider

7014
03:44:27,600 --> 03:44:31,020
But compared to the two of you, the front of the material was made wider

7015
03:44:31,020 --> 03:44:33,360
And I was able to join no problem!!

7016
03:44:34,220 --> 03:44:36,530
We had low hopes for an okay on your end

7017
03:44:35,830 --> 03:44:36,530
Right

7018
03:44:36,530 --> 03:44:38,060
We did some terrible things...

7019
03:44:38,060 --> 03:44:41,060
And this is our penance of some sort

7020
03:44:41,060 --> 03:44:43,030
You haven't done anything wrong though

7021
03:44:43,030 --> 03:44:43,900
Don't we have something in common between us?

7022
03:44:43,900 --> 03:44:45,900
Don't we have something in common between us?

Oh come on...

7055
03:46:16,330 --> 03:46:19,130
Well, that was something

7056
03:46:19,660 --> 03:46:24,930
12 hours into their School Life

7057
03:46:23,770 --> 03:46:25,840
Back in the class room

7058
03:46:26,840 --> 03:46:28,590
Their suspicion of a certain man pops up again

7059
03:46:33,560 --> 03:46:35,700
Do we not have to do Kokkuri-san or anything again?

7060
03:46:36,300 --> 03:46:38,820
Kokkuri-san was... What was it again?

7061
03:46:39,320 --> 03:46:40,920

That's the Thai Kick

7063
03:46:41,940 --> 03:46:44,320
It's pretty rough how you keep getting kicked

7064
03:46:44,550 --> 03:46:44,920
Right?

7065
03:46:45,020 --> 03:46:46,110
Yeah, you're right

7066
03:46:47,160 --> 03:46:47,920
The Thai Kick from before

7067
03:46:47,920 --> 03:46:49,930
Do you still remember the feeling of the Thai kick?

7068
03:46:50,030 --> 03:46:52,510
Of course I remember. It was a proper kick

7069
03:46:51,290 --> 03:46:53,060
Could you show us?

7070
03:46:53,050 --> 03:46:55,010
Give it a try

7071
03:46:55,130 --> 03:46:56,270
You got it over there, right

7072
03:46:55,670 --> 03:47:02,910
Tanaka reenacting the reaction

7073
03:46:55,670 --> 03:47:02,910
The Thai Kick from earlier

7074
03:46:56,470 --> 03:46:57,420
Try to recreate it

7075
03:46:57,430 --> 03:46:58,280
As best as you can

7076
03:46:58,300 --> 03:46:59,900
It was quite the show!

7077
03:46:59,640 --> 03:47:00,540
It was really something

7078
03:47:00,350 --> 03:47:01,220
Right!

7079
03:47:01,650 --> 03:47:02,770
Ready?

7080
03:47:04,940 --> 03:47:05,580
ACTION!

7081
03:47:05,810 --> 03:47:08,210
AIAAAGH!!!

7082
03:47:06,610 --> 03:47:08,210
AGH

7083
03:47:06,940 --> 03:47:08,210
AGH

7084
03:47:09,550 --> 03:47:11,850
AAAAHAAAAA!!

7085
03:47:13,000 --> 03:47:14,730
IT HURTS! IT HURTS! IT HURTS!

7086
03:47:15,420 --> 03:47:18,190
Whoa, he's incredible!!

7087
03:47:19,060 --> 03:47:22,890
He's doing it no problem!!

7088
03:47:20,020 --> 03:47:21,990
You can do it after all!

7089
03:47:22,240 --> 03:47:23,040
Incredible

7090
03:47:22,560 --> 03:47:23,740
Freaking incredible

7091
03:47:24,690 --> 03:47:28,300
You're really good

7092
03:47:25,780 --> 03:47:26,760
Amazing stuff

7093
03:47:29,420 --> 03:47:29,780
EH?

7094
03:47:29,930 --> 03:47:31,550
That was something else!

7095
03:47:32,000 --> 03:47:32,750
That was...

7096
03:47:32,820 --> 03:47:34,550
Unbelievable

7097
03:47:34,770 --> 03:47:39,810
Reenactment complete with other-worldly skills

7098
03:47:37,060 --> 03:47:38,240
You're that good??

7099
03:47:38,390 --> 03:47:41,280
No no, I just realized. The two are different

7100
03:47:42,050 --> 03:47:43,610
Anyone can do what I just did!

7101
03:47:43,610 --> 03:47:45,850
I'm feeling a bit let down here

7102
03:47:45,850 --> 03:47:48,000
Aah... I didn't want to bring it up... But

7103
03:47:49,390 --> 03:47:50,520
During "Don't Get Scared" did you fake it there too?

7104
03:47:50,520 --> 03:47:54,720
During "Don't Get Scared" did you fake it there too?

7105
03:47:53,410 --> 03:47:54,720
Eh? Hold on there!

7106
03:47:54,740 --> 03:47:56,690
Of course he faked it!

7107
03:47:56,260 --> 03:47:58,090
I just got chills down my spine

7108
03:47:58,140 --> 03:47:59,230
This is scary

7109
03:47:59,280 --> 03:48:00,210
You're talking about this, right?

7110
03:48:00,210 --> 03:48:01,480
Yeah yeah!

7111
03:48:00,360 --> 03:48:07,140
Last year's Don't Get Scared

7112
03:48:02,230 --> 03:48:05,000
That doesn't sit right with me at all

7113
03:48:07,100 --> 03:48:11,410
There is something I would like to see...

7114
03:48:11,420 --> 03:48:11,990
Spit it out

7115
03:48:12,280 --> 03:48:15,480
This is just my suggestion, but hear me out

7116
03:48:16,560 --> 03:48:17,650
When Tenshin-kun

7117
03:48:17,810 --> 03:48:21,080
Does anything to Tanaka, we can't really tell so...

7118
03:48:21,080 --> 03:48:21,380
Right

7119
03:48:22,440 --> 03:48:26,860
What if we had Endo get a Thai Kick...

7120
03:48:26,860 --> 03:48:29,130
Y-you mean me?

7121
03:48:27,740 --> 03:48:28,470
Yeah...

7122
03:48:30,190 --> 03:48:35,930
And at the same time, Tanaka will pretend he's the one getting kicked...

7123
03:48:33,080 --> 03:48:34,000
I see!

7124
03:48:35,930 --> 03:48:43,670
Endo is kicked while Tanaka pretends

7125
03:48:35,930 --> 03:48:43,670
Test of acting skills

7126
03:48:36,350 --> 03:48:38,520
The real thing VS the fake

7127
03:48:38,850 --> 03:48:40,040
That's a great idea!

7128
03:48:40,070 --> 03:48:42,460
We never had a good comparison

7129
03:48:41,590 --> 03:48:43,460
We never saw them side by side so it's hard to compare

7130
03:48:43,470 --> 03:48:43,910
I see

7131
03:48:43,920 --> 03:48:45,480
So when the kick connects

7132
03:48:45,530 --> 03:48:47,340
From the moment the kick connects. Exactly

7133
03:48:47,940 --> 03:48:49,530
And Endo will just take it naturally

7134
03:48:49,560 --> 03:48:49,980
Yep

7135
03:48:50,000 --> 03:48:50,810
I will just

7136
03:48:50,960 --> 03:48:51,730
Take the kick

7137
03:48:51,200 --> 03:48:53,480
Don't add anything to your reaction

7138
03:48:53,480 --> 03:48:55,150
You can't do that kind of acting anyways

7139
03:48:55,150 --> 03:48:57,850
You can't do that kind of acting anyways

7140
03:48:55,600 --> 03:48:55,990
Okay

7141
03:48:56,000 --> 03:48:56,790
Naturally

7142
03:48:57,240 --> 03:48:59,170
I could tell that much from you with the Tom & Jerry performance

7143
03:48:59,190 --> 03:49:05,230
Starring Endo

7144
03:48:59,190 --> 03:49:05,230
T/N: Endo played as "Tom" in the Japanese musical version of "Tom and Jerry". Endo's also just generally well known among the Gaki crew to have poor acting skills (ie, the movie, Busjack).

7145
03:48:59,190 --> 03:49:05,230
The Tom & Jerry Musical

7146
03:48:59,610 --> 03:49:00,640
I did my best

7147
03:49:01,070 --> 03:49:02,130
I really did my best with that one

7148
03:49:01,890 --> 03:49:02,890
They're just casually laughing

7149
03:49:02,460 --> 03:49:03,490
So casually

7150
03:49:03,460 --> 03:49:06,230
My acting in Tom & Jerry wasn't that bad

7151
03:49:05,660 --> 03:49:07,530
That's a terrible burn

7152
03:49:07,760 --> 03:49:11,470
Crazy fire is being thrown around in here

7153
03:49:11,020 --> 03:49:12,890
This jackass too! Hit him!

7154
03:49:12,490 --> 03:49:13,600
You forgot this guy!

7155
03:49:13,790 --> 03:49:14,500
Come on!

7156
03:49:14,520 --> 03:49:15,960
Why are you...

7157
03:49:16,710 --> 03:49:17,260
That's right

7158
03:49:17,270 --> 03:49:19,260
I really see it now

7159
03:49:20,080 --> 03:49:23,250
To test actor Tanaka's honesty,

7160
03:49:23,250 --> 03:49:26,680
We'll have him and his comedy partner who can't act at all,

7161
03:49:26,880 --> 03:49:31,020
Do it at the same time

7162
03:49:29,220 --> 03:49:31,020
And finally get a proper answer!!

7163
03:49:31,140 --> 03:49:32,440
He straight up said it!

7164
03:49:36,060 --> 03:49:37,630
Do it at the same time!!

7165
03:49:37,640 --> 03:49:39,110
For real!?

7166
03:49:39,110 --> 03:49:41,410
I'm practically being thrown in the furnace!

7167
03:49:39,450 --> 03:49:41,530
This is it! Here it is!

7168
03:49:41,550 --> 03:49:43,670
Position yourself side by side

7169
03:49:42,880 --> 03:49:46,190
I'm being burned alive here

7170
03:49:46,690 --> 03:49:47,190
Get ready

7171
03:49:47,040 --> 03:49:48,100
But Endo, it's true

7172
03:49:47,840 --> 03:49:48,090
No

7173
03:49:48,770 --> 03:49:51,390
Endo, don't overreacting even one bit!!

7174
03:49:49,920 --> 03:49:52,490
I'll just take it honestly?

7175
03:49:51,420 --> 03:49:52,790
Honestly! Honestly! Honestly!

7176
03:49:52,870 --> 03:49:54,970
Do it for Tanaka's sake

7177
03:49:53,410 --> 03:49:57,730
Acting Skills Inspection

7178
03:49:53,410 --> 03:49:57,730
Endo will take the Thai kick and Tanaka's acting skills will be put to the test

7179
03:49:56,170 --> 03:49:57,410
For Tanaka?

7180
03:49:57,430 --> 03:49:57,990
Here we go!

7181
03:49:58,240 --> 03:49:59,030
Please wait!

7182
03:49:59,040 --> 03:50:00,260
Here it comes

7183
03:49:59,310 --> 03:50:00,260
Hold on! hold on!

7184
03:50:00,550 --> 03:50:03,330
AHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHH

7185
03:50:03,170 --> 03:50:05,850
Look! Tanaka has already started!!

7186
03:50:04,650 --> 03:50:05,480
Any minute now

7187
03:50:05,380 --> 03:50:05,880
Here I go!

7188
03:50:05,880 --> 03:50:07,150
NNNOOOOOAAAAAAAA!!

7189
03:50:07,550 --> 03:50:09,920
UWAHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHH

7190
03:50:09,960 --> 03:50:12,090
IT HURTS!!

7191
03:50:20,350 --> 03:50:23,920
This is the absolute worst

7192
03:50:24,420 --> 03:50:25,690
The worst

7193
03:50:25,700 --> 03:50:27,060
This is the worst

7194
03:50:27,060 --> 03:50:28,640
The best and the worst, side by side

7195
03:50:28,060 --> 03:50:30,140
Endo, look at that. What even is that?

7196
03:50:30,140 --> 03:50:33,400
Endo, look at that. What even is that?

7197
03:50:31,380 --> 03:50:33,400
This is how a real Thai Kick looks

7198
03:50:38,480 --> 03:50:39,450
Thank you, Tenshin!

7199
03:50:40,190 --> 03:50:41,040
Thank you so much. That was a great experiment

7200
03:50:41,040 --> 03:50:43,110
Thank you so much. That was a great experiment

7201
03:50:43,520 --> 03:50:46,290
We just discovered something we shouldn't have!!

7202
03:50:47,280 --> 03:50:48,040
Endo, I'm sorry

7203
03:50:48,180 --> 03:50:49,930
I'm sorry I put you through this

7204
03:50:50,560 --> 03:50:50,910
So much pain

7205
03:50:51,250 --> 03:50:55,250
I'm about to poop myself...

7206
03:50:52,260 --> 03:50:53,520
It feels like poops gonna come out, right?

7207
03:50:53,780 --> 03:50:55,420
That's how it should feel

7208
03:50:55,420 --> 03:50:56,590
You get kicked speechless

7209
03:50:57,000 --> 03:50:58,850
You can't do anything, but whimper

7210
03:51:00,420 --> 03:51:01,760
The whole "IT HURTS! IT HURTS!"

7211
03:51:02,370 --> 03:51:04,240
And doing this whole thing

7212
03:51:05,560 --> 03:51:06,510
All these years...

7213
03:51:07,200 --> 03:51:10,570
It almost makes you think whether he got kicked or not

7214
03:51:10,620 --> 03:51:11,330
I thought "Wait a sec!"

7215
03:51:11,330 --> 03:51:11,730
Right

7216
03:51:11,930 --> 03:51:12,300
It's like...

7217
03:51:12,300 --> 03:51:18,570
Even though Endo really got kicked,

7218
03:51:14,800 --> 03:51:18,570
it sort of faded into the background to me

7219
03:51:16,660 --> 03:51:17,420
I did get kicked though

7220
03:51:17,960 --> 03:51:18,460
Really

7221
03:51:18,470 --> 03:51:19,270
He's the worst

7222
03:51:18,690 --> 03:51:19,390
Faded?

7223
03:51:19,720 --> 03:51:21,580
Tanaka is, in terms of variety, unnacceptable...

7224
03:51:21,580 --> 03:51:24,110
Tanaka is, in terms of variety, unnacceptable...

7225
03:51:23,060 --> 03:51:23,500
No no

7226
03:51:24,460 --> 03:51:30,100
13 hours into their school life

7227
03:51:26,570 --> 03:51:27,730
They're really showing us
something spectacular

7228
03:51:27,930 --> 03:51:28,870
That's pretty scary

7229
03:51:30,290 --> 03:51:40,100
Observing the Theater Club's Rehearsal

7230
03:51:30,290 --> 03:51:40,100
The performance that won the National Championship

7231
03:51:31,340 --> 03:51:35,260
The five members observe the theater club's rehearsal...

7232
03:51:35,470 --> 03:51:37,780
...of the performance that won them the National Championship

7233
03:51:38,040 --> 03:51:38,880
We're meeting them?

7234
03:51:40,260 --> 03:51:41,150
We're going in guys

7235
03:51:40,380 --> 03:51:43,670
Theater Club's Clubroom

7236
03:51:44,100 --> 03:51:47,340
This is where they do the final rehearsals

7237
03:51:47,340 --> 03:51:48,340
Please sit down

7238
03:51:47,800 --> 03:51:49,300
Oh this is a rehearsal?

7239
03:51:52,540 --> 03:51:55,810
I expected more of an audience for this

7240
03:51:54,560 --> 03:51:54,980
Yes

7241
03:51:57,380 --> 03:51:58,380
The stage has been set already

7242
03:51:58,380 --> 03:52:01,320
The stage has been set already

7243
03:52:01,500 --> 03:52:07,120
Start of the play

7244
03:52:07,120 --> 03:52:11,060
Naoto Eguchi (Doburokku)

7245
03:52:07,120 --> 03:52:11,060

03:52:07,770 --> 03:52:14,760
I am a penniless farmer

7247
03:52:11,560 --> 03:52:14,760
together with my old, frail mother

7248
03:52:14,910 --> 03:52:19,850
We live a secluded life together

7249
03:52:19,890 --> 03:52:25,610
The act that won the National Championship

7250
03:52:22,300 --> 03:52:25,610
Having an incurable disease

7251
03:52:25,720 --> 03:52:29,160
Trying to save my suffering mother

7252
03:52:29,310 --> 03:52:33,720
I came to the forest to look for a cure

7253
03:52:34,520 --> 03:52:35,180
Somewhere in this forest, there should be some medicine I could use

7254
03:52:35,180 --> 03:52:36,250
Somewhere in this forest, there should be some medicine I could use

7255
03:52:36,250 --> 03:52:39,770
But where is it? Where is it? Where? Where...

7256
03:52:40,210 --> 03:52:46,900
I have been waiting for exactly this, to help out a troubled man

I am a God residing in these woods

7260

I-IT'S A GOD!!

7261
03:52:51,670 --> 03:52:52,330
I-IT'S A GOD!!

7262
03:52:52,330 --> 03:52:54,070
I-IT'S A GOD!!

7263
03:52:54,340 --> 03:53:00,880
Your kindness towards your mother, is filling me with wondrous joy

7264
03:53:01,330 --> 03:53:07,680
I have come to offer you my help

7265
03:53:08,350 --> 03:53:14,960
Is this really real, this I can't believe. I am forever grateful to you

7266
03:53:15,270 --> 03:53:21,700
Whatever it is, I will grant you one wish

7267
03:53:22,430 --> 03:53:28,300
In that case, I wish for a Johnson of enormous size

7268
03:53:28,600 --> 03:53:31,770
I wish for a Johnson of enormous size

7269
03:53:31,870 --> 03:53:35,180
Something that can penetrate the fabric of my pants

7270
03:53:35,240 --> 03:53:40,720
I wish for a Johnson of enormous size

7274
03:53:52,960 --> 03:53:59,530
I am also a poor farmer, together with my old, frail mother

7275
03:53:59,900 --> 03:54:04,010
We live a secluded life together

7276
03:54:06,840 --> 03:54:13,850
Having an incurable disease, trying to save my suffering mother

7277
03:54:13,970 --> 03:54:18,520
I came to the forest to look for a cure

7278
03:54:19,890 --> 03:54:23,740
You think he will sing it?

7279
03:54:20,770 --> 03:54:27,160
Your kindness towards your mother, is filling me with wondrous joy

7280
03:54:27,500 --> 03:54:33,750
Let me also give you a helping hand

7281
03:54:34,340 --> 03:54:41,180
Is this really real, this I can't believe. I am forever grateful to you

7282
03:54:41,340 --> 03:54:48,120
Whatever it is, I will grant you one wish

7283
03:54:46,480 --> 03:54:48,120
It's not okay to say it

7284
03:54:48,430 --> 03:54:54,060
In that case,

7285
03:54:51,020 --> 03:54:54,060
I wish for a Johnson of enormous size

7286
03:54:54,410 --> 03:54:57,530
I wish for a Johnson of enormous size

7287
03:54:55,610 --> 03:54:57,040
He said it!

7288
03:54:57,080 --> 03:54:58,490
He said it!

7289
03:54:57,760 --> 03:55:00,700
So huge I can carry it on my shoulder

7290
03:55:00,980 --> 03:55:07,240
I wish for a truly huge Johnson

7291
03:55:05,330 --> 03:55:07,240
He really said it!!

7292
03:55:07,990 --> 03:55:09,300
Could you just stop

7293
03:55:09,770 --> 03:55:14,510
Trying to help you two, I was an idiot for showing myself

7294
03:55:14,590 --> 03:55:16,160
It was a joke, a terrible joke

7295
03:55:16,390 --> 03:55:20,420
I beg you to save the life of my mother

7296
03:55:20,420 --> 03:55:20,650
Yes!

7297
03:55:20,650 --> 03:55:20,850
Yes!

7298
03:55:20,850 --> 03:55:22,450
Yes!

7299
03:55:21,420 --> 03:55:26,420
Please be so kind!

7300
03:55:28,140 --> 03:55:28,760
Right!

7301
03:55:28,970 --> 03:55:29,790
That's what you meant

7302
03:55:29,940 --> 03:55:35,700
Furthermore, I wish for a Johnson of enormous size

7303
03:55:35,760 --> 03:55:38,830
I wish for a Johnson of enormous size

7304
03:55:37,700 --> 03:55:38,880
You only have one wish!

7305
03:55:38,950 --> 03:55:42,140
Something that will surprise Shingo and Tsuyoshi

7306
03:55:42,390 --> 03:55:48,510
I wish for a Johnson of enormous size

7307
03:55:44,010 --> 03:55:45,640
Stop improvising!!

7308
03:55:47,230 --> 03:55:49,260
What are you saying, Goro?

7309
03:55:53,520 --> 03:55:56,230
That was unbelievable

7310
03:55:56,250 --> 03:55:58,120
You went there huh...

7311
03:56:04,210 --> 03:56:07,010
It's really amazing

7312
03:56:05,640 --> 03:56:07,010
I was really surprised

7313
03:56:07,660 --> 03:56:08,660
What's that? You say you like theater acting?

7314
03:56:08,660 --> 03:56:10,330
What's that? You say you like theater acting?

7315
03:56:12,800 --> 03:56:13,940
You're interested in theater?

7316
03:56:13,940 --> 03:56:16,170
I really enjoyed watching it

7317
03:56:16,520 --> 03:56:18,240
Well, since you're interested in theater I'll teach you some secrets

7318
03:56:18,240 --> 03:56:19,690
Well, since you're interested in theater I'll teach you some secrets

7319
03:56:19,820 --> 03:56:20,480
Firstly

7320
03:56:20,480 --> 03:56:21,180
In theater you have to strongly project your voice

7321
03:56:21,180 --> 03:56:23,140
In theater you have to strongly project your voice

7322
03:56:23,400 --> 03:56:25,510
We have

7323
03:56:25,510 --> 03:56:26,410
Traditional training method in our club

7324
03:56:26,410 --> 03:56:29,580
Traditional training method in our club

7325
03:56:28,500 --> 03:56:29,580
I'd like you all to give it a shot

7326
03:56:29,880 --> 03:56:30,800
Experiencing the traditional voice projection training

7327
03:56:31,090 --> 03:56:32,170
Oh are we-

7328
03:56:32,170 --> 03:56:34,960
This candle being protected in a wine glass

7329
03:56:35,260 --> 03:56:39,030
Can be put out with a high pitched voice

7330
03:56:36,290 --> 03:56:45,300
Produce a high pitched voice from the diaphragm to put out the candle in the glass

7331
03:56:36,290 --> 03:56:45,300
Voice projection training method

7332
03:56:39,340 --> 03:56:40,710
Coming from your diaphragm

7333
03:56:40,960 --> 03:56:43,830
May we ask for an example?

7334
03:56:43,160 --> 03:56:44,370
Yes, okay

7335
03:56:44,020 --> 03:56:45,270
Let's show an example

7336
03:56:45,630 --> 03:56:51,570
An example from the Theater Club

7337
03:57:00,950 --> 03:57:04,320
Whoa

7338
03:57:01,520 --> 03:57:04,320
What, really?

7339
03:57:01,980 --> 03:57:04,320
Incredible!!

7340
03:57:02,520 --> 03:57:03,590
Wonderful!

7341
03:57:02,720 --> 03:57:04,320
That's incredible

7342
03:57:03,820 --> 03:57:05,650
See it's amazing!

7343
03:57:05,650 --> 03:57:06,450
Incredible

7344
03:57:06,450 --> 03:57:07,020
It's incredible doing that with just vibrations isn't it?

7345
03:57:07,020 --> 03:57:09,290
It's incredible doing that with just vibrations isn't it?

7346
03:57:09,290 --> 03:57:10,380
Then how about

7347
03:57:10,760 --> 03:57:11,860
Everyone tries it

7348
03:57:11,860 --> 03:57:12,590
You two

7349
03:57:13,460 --> 03:57:14,110
You go

7350
03:57:14,860 --> 03:57:17,370
Do it like your seniors okay?

7351
03:57:17,700 --> 03:57:18,880
Can we really put it out?

7352
03:57:17,700 --> 03:57:22,870
Downtown will try and do the vocal exercise

7353
03:57:18,880 --> 03:57:20,500
Project your voice from your abdomen

7354
03:57:20,840 --> 03:57:22,870
And put it out with the vibration of the air

7355
03:57:22,870 --> 03:57:23,610
On my mark

7356
03:57:23,610 --> 03:57:24,810
Ready... Start!

7357
03:57:27,160 --> 03:57:28,660
Unbelievable!

7358
03:57:29,740 --> 03:57:30,560
They did it faster

7359
03:57:30,850 --> 03:57:32,280
That was too fast

7360
03:57:32,950 --> 03:57:38,290
That was unexpectedly fast

7361
03:57:33,300 --> 03:57:34,650
That was too fast, can we-

7362
03:57:34,650 --> 03:57:35,330
Is there such a thing?

7363
03:57:35,330 --> 03:57:36,370
Isn't that good?

7364
03:57:36,890 --> 03:57:39,320
That was too fast, let's try more

7365
03:57:40,420 --> 03:57:41,860
Are we getting hit for that?

7366
03:57:44,430 --> 03:57:47,530
Wouldn't you say they did excellent?

7367
03:57:47,650 --> 03:57:48,330
Let's do it one more time

7368
03:57:48,330 --> 03:57:49,550
A high pitched voi-

7369
03:57:48,330 --> 03:57:54,900
Downtown are doing the exercise once again

7370
03:57:49,550 --> 03:57:50,920
You breathed inside didn't you?

7371
03:57:50,920 --> 03:57:52,630
You breathed in right?

7372
03:57:52,630 --> 03:57:54,400
I was doing it from below

7373
03:57:54,400 --> 03:57:55,770
Let me hold it higher then

7374
03:57:55,520 --> 03:57:55,770
Right

7375
03:57:55,770 --> 03:57:56,420
The breath shouldn't hit the candle directly

7376
03:57:56,420 --> 03:57:57,810
The breath shouldn't hit the candle directly

7377
03:57:56,770 --> 03:57:59,140
I get it I get, from around here right?

7378
03:57:57,810 --> 03:57:59,670
No cheating allowed okay?

7379
03:57:59,670 --> 03:58:00,940
Ready START!

7380
03:58:03,750 --> 03:58:08,050
The resonating air vibrates to put it out

7381
03:58:04,010 --> 03:58:05,030
Amazing!

7382
03:58:04,330 --> 03:58:06,280
That's so incredible!

7383
03:58:05,300 --> 03:58:06,100
It's amazing!

7384
03:58:08,530 --> 03:58:10,350
Yes, it flickered so well!

7385
03:58:10,900 --> 03:58:12,640
They were so much faster than you

7386
03:58:12,050 --> 03:58:13,820
They're in a pinch!

7387
03:58:17,090 --> 03:58:19,990
Isn't this a good thing though?

7388
03:58:18,530 --> 03:58:19,990
Well it is, but...

7389
03:58:21,110 --> 03:58:22,460
It's pretty remarkable

7390
03:58:22,460 --> 03:58:25,770
It's remarkable, right?

7391
03:58:25,770 --> 03:58:28,570
We were very happy today

7392
03:58:26,370 --> 03:58:28,570
That you came over to watch us

7393
03:58:29,100 --> 03:58:31,370
Can we get your opinions about the play maybe?

7394
03:58:31,370 --> 03:58:32,220
You there

7395
03:58:32,370 --> 03:58:32,670
Yes

7396
03:58:32,670 --> 03:58:33,940
How was the play?

7397
03:58:34,240 --> 03:58:35,280
Well uhmm...

7398
03:58:35,280 --> 03:58:36,260
Well uhmm...

7399
03:58:35,630 --> 03:58:37,780
To summarize, what the lip monster want to tell us is this

7400
03:58:37,780 --> 03:58:40,850
To summarize, what the lip monster want to tell us is this

7401
03:58:41,350 --> 03:58:44,190
I wish for a Johnson of enormous size

7402
03:58:44,640 --> 03:58:51,130
One that can go through a barrel of wine

7403
03:58:47,820 --> 03:58:51,130
Even overshadowing giant trees

7404
03:58:51,380 --> 03:58:53,060
I wish for a Johnson of enormous size

7405
03:58:53,060 --> 03:58:57,230
I wish for a Johnson of enormous size

7406
03:59:00,150 --> 03:59:02,740
I didn't say that, though...

7407
03:59:07,530 --> 03:59:08,530
Sorry sorry sorry

7408
03:59:09,110 --> 03:59:11,280
My body did it out of reflex

7409
03:59:10,950 --> 03:59:11,980
What are you saying??

7410
03:59:11,980 --> 03:59:13,820
Sorry sorry sorry, it was just a reflex

7411
03:59:13,820 --> 03:59:15,150
Okay, one last question for you

7412
03:59:15,500 --> 03:59:19,450
Can we perhaps hear your

7413
03:59:17,150 --> 03:59:19,450
Thoughts about the play?

7414
03:59:19,870 --> 03:59:23,190
I was able to see a new perspective

7415
03:59:22,240 --> 03:59:22,870
Really?

7416
03:59:23,590 --> 03:59:25,790
Are there anything critiques you'd like to give?

7417
03:59:26,560 --> 03:59:27,160
I mean not rea- I didn't see anything that was off...

7418
03:59:27,160 --> 03:59:28,430
I mean not rea- I didn't see anything that was off...

7419
03:59:28,610 --> 03:59:33,900
In short, what the muscle-head want to tell us is this

7420
03:59:34,000 --> 03:59:37,370
I wish for a Johnson of enormous size

7421
03:59:37,440 --> 03:59:43,710
One so big that it would destroy the image I've built up

7422
03:59:44,230 --> 03:59:49,350
I wish for a Johnson of enormous size

7423
03:59:49,480 --> 03:59:50,940
That's all they can talk about

7424
03:59:56,290 --> 03:59:59,490
Oh dear Goro, Johnsons are not just about size

7425
03:59:59,490 --> 04:00:03,880

This guy's the straight man

7542
04:04:26,110 --> 04:04:27,450
Wow, his muscles are twitching

7543
04:04:27,450 --> 04:04:30,380
That's impressive

7544
04:04:28,500 --> 04:04:30,380

04:04:50,050 --> 04:04:51,710
He's here this year too

7553
04:04:52,710 --> 04:04:54,110
He turned up again this year

7554
04:04:56,480 --> 04:04:59,450
Immoral

04:05:31,210 --> 04:05:31,730
Yeah?

7570
04:05:31,730 --> 04:05:33,010
No matter how many times I do it I tense up

7571
04:05:33,010 --> 04:05:34,430
That's for sure

7572
04:05:34,580 --> 04:05:35,810
Especially since

7573
04:05:35,810 --> 04:05:37,370
Our audience is so cool today

7574
04:05:37,370 --> 04:05:38,800
Definitely

7575
04:05:37,920 --> 04:05:38,800
I'm a little nervous

7576
04:05:38,800 --> 04:05:39,720
Yeah for sure

7577
04:05:39,720 --> 04:05:41,350

04:05:48,530 --> 04:05:51,610
Whoa! The straight man takes the initiative and suddenly

Hits with his open palm!

7585
04:05:53,930 --> 04:05:55,220
Towards the funny man

7586
04:05:55,220 --> 04:05:58,390
Such a powerful retort! Kawashima, are you okay!?

7587
04:05:58,570 --> 04:06:07,230
They already laughed, but please watch until the end

7588

That's intense

7590
04:05:59,720 --> 04:06:02,690
Can he still act stupid?

7591
04:06:02,690 --> 04:06:04,080
Is he okay?

7592
04:06:04,080 --> 04:06:05,740
It's too severe

7593
04:06:04,790 --> 04:06:05,680
Come on!

7594
04:06:05,740 --> 04:06:07,230
Breaks your heart to see it

7595
04:06:07,230 --> 04:06:08,700

Just breaks your heart

7598
04:06:13,830 --> 04:06:15,140
He can't act stupid after that

7599
04:06:17,000 --> 04:06:18,760
Can he still play at being stupid?

7600
04:06:21,810 --> 04:06:23,790
He's gone dizzy in the head

7601
04:06:25,410 --> 04:06:28,070
He needs a bit of time

7602
04:06:30,730 --> 04:06:32,820
Come on, be stupid

7603
04:06:32,820 --> 04:06:35,520
He's all lightheaded

7604
04:06:33,950 --> 04:06:35,520
This is crazy

7605
04:06:37,660 --> 04:06:40,530
But really, everyone is so cool

7606
04:06:40,530 --> 04:06:43,160

7610
04:06:44,750 --> 04:06:45,820
A guy who is no longer relevant

7611
04:06:44,750 --> 04:06:48,140
T/N: This was a play-on-words. "Irrelevant" in Japanese is "rongai" which rhymes with "naisu gai" (nice guy).

7612
04:06:45,820 --> 04:06:48,140
That's rude

7613
04:06:48,140 --> 04:06:49,850
Saying that he's irrelevant!

7614
04:06:49,850 --> 04:06:52,070
Why don't you stop

7615
04:06:52,070 --> 04:06:54,070
Fooling around all the time!

7616
04:06:54,640 --> 04:07:01,220
Dropkick! He's blown off his feet! This is Ito's extreme straight man right here!

7617
04:06:55,760 --> 04:06:57,140
Oi!

7618
04:06:59,650 --> 04:07:01,220
Get up!

7619
04:07:03,580 --> 04:07:06,490
Looks like he's taken a lot of damage!

7620
04:07:06,490 --> 04:07:09,190
Kawashima...

7621
04:07:07,990 --> 04:07:11,060
Will Kawashima give up?

7622
04:07:09,220 --> 04:07:11,060
You're getting cheered on

7623
04:07:11,060 --> 04:07:13,690
Hang in there, Kawashima

7624
04:07:12,490 --> 04:07:13,690
Go for it

7625
04:07:13,990 --> 04:07:15,860
Don't give up!

7626
04:07:17,800 --> 04:07:20,200
Can he stand up?

7627
04:07:20,630 --> 04:07:22,190
He's up!

7628
04:07:22,190 --> 04:07:24,310
Amazing, really

7629
04:07:22,740 --> 04:07:24,310
Well then

7630
04:07:25,240 --> 04:07:26,320
Wow

7631
04:07:27,370 --> 04:07:29,040
Well actually,

7632
04:07:29,040 --> 04:07:31,550
How can he keep going?

7633
04:07:29,940 --> 04:07:31,550
I don't have much money

7634
04:07:31,550 --> 04:07:34,250
So I'm thinking of getting a part-time job soon

7635
04:07:34,250 --> 04:07:35,230
Right

7636
04:07:35,230 --> 04:07:36,530
Actually recently,

7637
04:07:36,530 --> 04:07:38,950
I don't have much money either so I was thinking of working part-time at a convenience store

7638
04:07:38,950 --> 04:07:40,050
Convenience store, huh

7639
04:07:40,050 --> 04:07:42,260
Let's try it

7640
04:07:41,160 --> 04:07:42,260
Okay then

7641
04:07:42,260 --> 04:07:43,190
I'll be the convenience store worker

7642
04:07:43,190 --> 04:07:46,830
If you'll be the customer

7643
04:07:44,680 --> 04:07:46,830
Okay, the customer? Got it

7644
04:07:48,480 --> 04:07:50,600
Oh, it's a convenience store

7645
04:07:50,600 --> 04:07:53,580
Ring-a-ling-a-ling

7646
04:07:50,600 --> 04:07:53,580
T/N: Having a bell on the door is more associated with coffee shops.

7647
04:07:53,580 --> 04:07:57,290
Hey, that's not a damn convenience store!

7648
04:07:57,290 --> 04:07:59,570
You're just joking

7649
04:07:59,570 --> 04:08:01,440
around!

7650
04:08:04,950 --> 04:08:06,710
Extreme sparks, ringing explosion

7651
04:08:06,710 --> 04:08:09,080
Extreme sparks, ringing explosion

7652
04:08:09,080 --> 04:08:09,520
Oh and on top of that...

7653
04:08:09,520 --> 04:08:11,550
Oh and on top of that...

7654
04:08:10,130 --> 04:08:12,790
Even though I said let's do a convenience store!

7655
04:08:12,790 --> 04:08:14,920
He's gotten the bat out!

7656
04:08:14,920 --> 04:08:16,490
It's not a coffee shop!

7657
04:08:17,220 --> 04:08:21,430
That's a ton of smoke!

7658
04:08:18,040 --> 04:08:20,040
This is insane

7659
04:08:20,240 --> 04:08:21,430
Come on, get up!

7660
04:08:24,900 --> 04:08:26,170
You!

7661
04:08:26,170 --> 04:08:28,470
What the hell is wrong?

7662
04:08:28,470 --> 04:08:32,010
I'll be the clerk so you be the customer

7663
04:08:29,820 --> 04:08:32,010
Even more put-downs coming from the straight man!

7664
04:08:32,010 --> 04:08:33,820
Well, what will you do? Funny man

7665
04:08:34,160 --> 04:08:38,010
Kawashima, will you finally give up?

7666
04:08:38,010 --> 04:08:39,410
Come on, quickly, do the customer!

7667
04:08:40,310 --> 04:08:41,600
Oh, a convenience store

7668
04:08:44,520 --> 04:08:46,200
He's gone stupid

7669
04:08:46,200 --> 04:08:47,990
That's a train!

7670
04:08:48,510 --> 04:08:50,090
Whoa, whoa, whoa

7671
04:08:49,190 --> 04:08:52,030
Get a grip!

7672
04:08:50,090 --> 04:08:52,030
Watch out!

7673
04:08:52,030 --> 04:08:54,030
Stop joking around!

7674
04:08:55,610 --> 04:08:57,870
It went all white!

7675
04:08:58,400 --> 04:08:59,500
Hitori, it's okay already

7676
04:09:01,520 --> 04:09:02,300
Now this is what I call

7677
04:09:03,100 --> 04:09:04,770
The Reiwa Era's new style manzai

7678
04:09:05,140 --> 04:09:06,170
However

7679
04:09:06,170 --> 04:09:08,110
He's taken too much damage!

7680
04:09:08,110 --> 04:09:09,880
So I'll do

7681
04:09:08,580 --> 04:09:09,880
He stands!

7682
04:09:09,880 --> 04:09:13,750
The convenience store clerk and you do the customer, hurry up

7683
04:09:11,810 --> 04:09:13,750
Don't be stupid, Kawashima!

7684
04:09:14,320 --> 04:09:14,720
That's enough!!

7685
04:09:14,720 --> 04:09:16,320
That's enough!!

7686
04:09:17,940 --> 04:09:19,020
Oh, a convenience store

7687
04:09:21,960 --> 04:09:23,290
Madam are you open?

7688
04:09:23,290 --> 04:09:25,230
That's not right either!!

7689
04:09:25,230 --> 04:09:27,230
We already told you to stop

7690
04:09:28,130 --> 04:09:30,860
Get back!!

7691
04:09:28,130 --> 04:09:30,860
Get back!!

7692
04:09:30,860 --> 04:09:32,900
Wait seriously?

7693
04:09:31,370 --> 04:09:32,900
Yeah over there

7694
04:09:32,900 --> 04:09:33,100
What!?

7695
04:09:33,100 --> 04:09:33,300
What!?

7696
04:09:33,300 --> 04:09:33,530
What!?

7697
04:09:33,530 --> 04:09:34,440
What!?

7698
04:09:33,930 --> 04:09:34,440
No way!

7699
04:09:34,590 --> 04:09:35,790
Take a look!

7700
04:09:42,060 --> 04:09:44,810
Ehhhh?

7701
04:09:42,510 --> 04:09:43,630
Kawashima...

7702
04:09:43,630 --> 04:09:44,810
Is he alright?

7703
04:09:45,130 --> 04:09:46,810
They put their lives on the line for comedy

7704
04:09:46,810 --> 04:09:48,380
And fight!

7705
04:09:48,380 --> 04:09:50,130
What will you do Kawashima?

7706
04:09:50,670 --> 04:09:53,190
I'm giving up

7707
04:09:51,690 --> 04:09:53,220
Thanks very much

7708
04:09:53,200 --> 04:09:56,960
Manzai Deathmatch is over

7709
04:09:53,200 --> 04:09:56,960
Manzai Deathmatch is over

7710
04:09:56,120 --> 04:09:57,880
That was crazy

7711
04:10:01,900 --> 04:10:06,270
I can't even see Kawashima...

7712
04:10:03,710 --> 04:10:05,200
Can't see him

7713
04:10:10,000 --> 04:10:11,960
That was amazing

7714
04:10:11,960 --> 04:10:14,310
I've never seen manzai like this before

7715
04:10:14,330 --> 04:10:18,410
At last the climax!! This year's Chono is a little different

7716
04:10:14,330 --> 04:10:18,410

04:17:12,360 --> 04:17:15,150
This is a gorilla, he's already doing a gorilla

8171
04:17:15,180 --> 04:17:18,670
Hamada is the gorilla part

8172
04:17:15,880 --> 04:17:18,670
It's not even an impression, he's just a gorilla

8173
04:17:18,670 --> 04:17:21,070
Hamada has known this from a young age but...

8174
04:17:21,070 --> 04:17:22,940
He can't do anything, doesn't do anything

8175
04:17:22,940 --> 04:17:24,500
Doesn't make efforts or have dreams

8176
04:17:24,500 --> 04:17:26,790
Doesn't have goals either and gets betrayed by his partner

8177
04:17:26,790 --> 04:17:28,280
Doesn't have a family either

8178
04:17:26,790 --> 04:17:30,110
T/N: ¥150,000 yen is approximately $1,402 USD.

8179
04:17:28,280 --> 04:17:30,110
And earns ¥150,000 a month at this stage of his career

8180
04:17:30,110 --> 04:17:32,950
Doesn't have a house or home or namesake TV show

8181
04:17:32,950 --> 04:17:34,850
Hasn't ever hosted a show and isn't even anything

8182
04:17:34,850 --> 04:17:36,530
What would you try hard at

8183
04:17:36,530 --> 04:17:37,530
And what can you do

8184
04:17:37,530 --> 04:17:39,950
Please enlighten me!!

8185
04:17:42,560 --> 04:17:44,560
That was insane

8186
04:17:43,460 --> 04:17:45,160
That was insane

8187
04:17:50,050 --> 04:17:52,470
He sure says a lot!

8188
04:17:52,770 --> 04:17:56,170
That blows my impression of Master Sakata out of the water

8189
04:17:56,750 --> 04:17:58,540
Really, no,

8190
04:17:58,540 --> 04:18:00,820
Why have you been like that since forever ago

8191
04:18:00,820 --> 04:18:03,090
Always always persisting at the same thing

8192
04:18:03,090 --> 04:18:05,500
Twitter, Instagram, social media

8193
04:18:05,500 --> 04:18:08,320
You've been dissed on all those platforms again and again

8194
04:18:08,320 --> 04:18:10,830
Making your partner get fed up with you and your seniors making you cry

8195
04:18:10,830 --> 04:18:12,850
Day in and day out crying in a corner of the house

8196
04:18:13,100 --> 04:18:15,390
What are your goals, what can you do, all of that

8197
04:18:15,390 --> 04:18:17,670
Enlighten me with it all!!

8198
04:18:24,260 --> 04:18:26,800
What impression of Hamada does he have?

8199
04:18:29,900 --> 04:18:32,570
That's enough!

8200
04:18:34,520 --> 04:18:35,710
Thank you for your dihonorable talent

8201
04:18:35,710 --> 04:18:37,240
Thank you for your dishonorable talent

8202
04:18:42,900 --> 04:18:44,130
That face!

8203
04:18:46,990 --> 04:18:48,990
Let's go

8204
04:18:50,460 --> 04:18:53,930
Kinda makes you sick

8205
04:18:51,810 --> 04:18:53,930
Definitely

8206
04:18:55,000 --> 04:18:58,000
I wanted to see more impressions

8207
04:19:01,230 --> 04:19:06,940
14 hours into their school life

8208
04:19:01,230 --> 04:19:06,940
17 hours has passed. Now begins the last press for answers

8209
04:19:10,130 --> 04:19:11,750
Everyone listen up

8210
04:19:12,250 --> 04:19:14,870
Your school life comes to a close soon

8211
04:19:14,900 --> 04:19:18,020
You all are going to have your last homeroom class so let's go

8212
04:19:18,020 --> 04:19:19,020
What's that?

8213
04:19:19,020 --> 04:19:22,790
We haven't even had one homeroom class,

8214
04:19:21,390 --> 04:19:22,790
but we're having our last one?

8215
04:19:23,460 --> 04:19:26,690
New assassins hunt down the 5

8216
04:19:26,690 --> 04:19:32,830
3rd grade classroom

8217
04:19:28,660 --> 04:19:30,500
Okay, please take your seats

8218
04:19:33,130 --> 04:19:35,300
Everyone, this is your last homeroom class

8219
04:19:35,300 --> 04:19:38,870
You'll all reflect on the time you spent with your teachers and friends

8220
04:19:39,810 --> 04:19:41,410
Huh? What's this feeling?

8221
04:19:46,480 --> 04:19:49,620
Head Teacher

8222
04:19:46,480 --> 04:19:49,620
Takeda Tetsuya

8223
04:19:52,420 --> 04:19:53,390
Shoulda known

8224
04:19:54,500 --> 04:19:58,790
Of course, "3-B"!

8225
04:19:54,500 --> 04:19:58,790
T/N: Takeda Tetsuya played the head teacher in the famous drama "Mr. Kinpachi of the Class 3-B".

8226
04:20:01,260 --> 04:20:03,530
Yep, "3-B" is written right there

8227
04:20:06,700 --> 04:20:10,170
Your graduation day has finally come

8228
04:20:10,740 --> 04:20:15,440
I'd like to start our last homeroom class

8229
04:20:15,440 --> 04:20:20,150
With your 25 classmates, me, the head teacher, and the assistant head teacher

8230
04:20:20,150 --> 04:20:22,220
Mr. Ito,

8231
04:20:22,220 --> 04:20:26,550
Let's make this a homeroom class we'll never forget

8232
04:20:26,570 --> 04:20:27,820
Um actually

8233
04:20:27,850 --> 04:20:30,860
I got a suggestion from Maeda, the class representative

8234
04:20:30,860 --> 04:20:35,860
He wrote an essay about his memories of the time he spent with everyone over the past year

8235
04:20:35,860 --> 04:20:38,730
I'm going to have Maeda read that essay now

8236
04:20:38,750 --> 04:20:40,220
Maeda, please

8237
04:20:40,980 --> 04:20:45,670
A lot happened over the past year; let's look back on it

8238
04:20:45,670 --> 04:20:47,040
Maeda, go ahead

8239
04:20:47,040 --> 04:20:52,400
Looking back over my school life

8240
04:20:49,710 --> 04:20:53,950
The first thing I think of is definitely our sports festival

8241
04:20:53,950 --> 04:20:58,890
In the class vs. class relay, of course, everyone ran their hardest

8242
04:20:59,070 --> 04:21:01,140
All of us became one-

8243
04:21:02,320 --> 04:21:03,560
Um, what the...

8244
04:21:03,110 --> 04:21:05,490
Yayyy!!

8245
04:21:05,490 --> 04:21:07,830
Everyone is an accomplice to the prank

8246
04:21:05,490 --> 04:21:07,830
What makes the last homeroom class special

8247
04:21:10,000 --> 04:21:12,500
Congratulations on graduating

8248
04:21:12,670 --> 04:21:14,880
Okay!!

8249
04:21:13,470 --> 04:21:15,470
That's really weird

8250
04:21:19,970 --> 04:21:21,980
Just a class of idiots

8251
04:21:27,450 --> 04:21:28,520
A grand slam of a surprise!! Nice Job!!

8252
04:21:28,520 --> 04:21:30,720
A grand slam of a surprise!! Nice Job!!

8253
04:21:30,720 --> 04:21:32,720
Well then,

8254
04:21:32,720 --> 04:21:34,890
I thought I would startle you all again

8255
04:21:34,890 --> 04:21:38,890
Actually, in all of your desks,

8256
04:21:38,890 --> 04:21:43,230
From the principal, is a

8257
04:21:38,890 --> 04:21:43,230
Wonderful, wonderful present

8258
04:21:43,230 --> 04:21:44,900
Okay, please take it out

8259
04:21:44,900 --> 04:21:50,190
Please look inside your desks, it's a present from the principal

8260
04:21:50,190 --> 04:21:51,450
Please open the lid

8261
04:21:53,010 --> 04:21:54,140
What!?

8262
04:21:54,140 --> 04:21:55,080
That's right!!

8263
04:21:55,080 --> 04:21:58,810
Everyone gets

8264
04:21:55,080 --> 04:21:58,810
Red and white steamed buns

8265
04:21:55,080 --> 04:21:58,810
T/N: Red and white are important colors to Japanese culture and it's often used in decorations and celebration, particularly for New Years.

8266
04:21:59,650 --> 04:22:01,050
Huh? Hamada's is a little different, no?

8267
04:22:01,050 --> 04:22:02,680
Huh? Hamada's is a little different, no?

8268
04:22:02,680 --> 04:22:05,340
Uh, mine's...

8269
04:22:06,340 --> 04:22:08,540
Hamada got

8270
04:22:08,540 --> 04:22:15,630
T/N: The red fox (kitsune) and green raccoon (tanuki) are two variations of instant udon noodle soup. The red fox flavor uses inari tofu skin (in folklore, foxes love inari), while the green raccoon flavor uses tempura bits.

8271
04:22:08,870 --> 04:22:15,630
Red fox and green raccoon

8272
04:22:16,530 --> 04:22:18,000
Yay!!

8273
04:22:21,790 --> 04:22:24,390
This is too much

8274
04:22:23,440 --> 04:22:24,600
Too much

8275
04:22:27,040 --> 04:22:29,110
He's really prepared a ton

8276
04:22:29,110 --> 04:22:31,580
He's really popular for sure

8277
04:22:31,580 --> 04:22:38,250
Actually, for this year's graduates there is a special present  and that is

8278
04:22:38,250 --> 04:22:45,390
A time capsule, this was the school's idea

8279
04:22:38,250 --> 04:22:45,390
To put everyone's voices into

8280
04:22:45,390 --> 04:22:48,560
That said, now everyone's prompt is...

8281
04:22:48,560 --> 04:22:56,700
"In 10 years, I want to be doing this job"

8282
04:22:52,830 --> 04:22:56,700
Let's all record your dreams here

8283
04:22:56,700 --> 04:22:59,540
First up is Tanaka

8284
04:22:59,540 --> 04:23:03,510
Tanaka, in ten year's time what kind of job will you be doing?

8285
04:23:03,510 --> 04:23:05,080
Please talk about that dream!!

8286
04:23:05,480 --> 04:23:06,500
Go!!

8287
04:23:07,750 --> 04:23:11,280
In 10 years I want it to be just the same

8288
04:23:11,280 --> 04:23:15,820
I'd like to be doing the same kind of job with everyone

8289
04:23:15,990 --> 04:23:18,830
Wonderful thoughts!! Applause!

8290
04:23:21,290 --> 04:23:23,880
Next is Endo

8291
04:23:23,880 --> 04:23:25,730
This has been an eventful year

8292
04:23:25,730 --> 04:23:28,520
Okay, here we go... Wait, wait

8293
04:23:28,520 --> 04:23:29,000
Go!

8294
04:23:30,600 --> 04:23:38,580
With all of my beloved members,

8295
04:23:32,710 --> 04:23:38,580
I'd like to continue working with them from the bottom of my heart

8296
04:23:41,550 --> 04:23:44,020
And now the class favorite!!

8297
04:23:44,020 --> 04:23:48,220
Let's get his thoughts on his 10-year dream. Please stand

8298
04:23:48,220 --> 04:23:50,720
When I say "Go" say your dream

8299
04:23:50,720 --> 04:23:53,060
Here we go... Go!!

8300
04:23:53,930 --> 04:24:00,070
In 10 years I'll be a policeman

8301
04:23:57,860 --> 04:24:00,070
When I graduate I'd like to become a policeman...

8302
04:24:00,080 --> 04:24:02,540
Okay!!

8303
04:24:00,080 --> 04:24:02,540
Okay!!

8304
04:24:05,360 --> 04:24:07,360
Yay!!

8305
04:24:05,360 --> 04:24:07,360
Yay!!

8306
04:24:10,210 --> 04:24:11,850
He really does it up

8307
04:24:15,550 --> 04:24:17,580
He's really toying with us

8308
04:24:16,530 --> 04:24:17,580
Not good

8309
04:24:17,580 --> 04:24:19,320
Okay, next

8310
04:24:19,320 --> 04:24:21,120
Hamada please come here

8311
04:24:21,120 --> 04:24:23,760
What!?

8312
04:24:21,940 --> 04:24:23,760
Come, here

8313
04:24:23,760 --> 04:24:25,790
Every morning didn't you always do that?

8314
04:24:26,260 --> 04:24:30,200
Let's do that

8315
04:24:27,690 --> 04:24:30,200
Do what?

8316
04:24:30,200 --> 04:24:33,530
Over there are the 4 class morals

8317
04:24:33,850 --> 04:24:40,060
Every morning we said them loudly in unison and vowed to uphold them

8318
04:24:40,540 --> 04:24:43,610
Written there are Class 3-B's 4 vows

8319
04:24:43,610 --> 04:24:44,810
Please read them

8320
04:24:45,430 --> 04:24:46,760
We'll start from the top

8321
04:24:46,630 --> 04:24:47,630
Okay

8322
04:24:46,760 --> 04:24:48,770
Okay, are you ready, Hamada?

8323
04:24:48,030 --> 04:24:49,220
Okay

8324
04:24:49,220 --> 04:24:50,080
First!!

8325
04:24:50,900 --> 04:24:54,090
As young people, we must respect our parents!!

8326
04:24:54,090 --> 04:24:55,260
Second!!

8327
04:24:55,310 --> 04:24:58,360
Become a person who loves their friends!!

8328
04:24:58,360 --> 04:25:00,160
Third!!

8329
04:25:00,240 --> 04:25:02,500
Become a person with an abundance of knowledge!!

8330
04:25:02,500 --> 04:25:04,660
Fourth!!

8331
04:25:05,110 --> 04:25:07,430
T/N: That is an actual line from the song "WOW WAR TONIGHT ~Toki ni wa Okoseyo Movement" which Hamada sang when he was in the band, "H Jungle with t".

8332
04:25:05,110 --> 04:25:07,430
When the time calls, start a movement

8333
04:25:07,430 --> 04:25:12,370
1.

8334
04:25:07,430 --> 04:25:12,370
2.

8335
04:25:07,430 --> 04:25:12,370
3.

8336
04:25:07,430 --> 04:25:12,370
4 class morals

8337
04:25:07,430 --> 04:25:12,370
4.

8338
04:25:07,430 --> 04:25:12,370
As young people,
we must respect our parents!!

8339
04:25:07,430 --> 04:25:12,370
Become a person who
loves their friends!!

8340
04:25:07,430 --> 04:25:12,370
Become a person with an
abundance of knowledge!!

8341
04:25:07,430 --> 04:25:12,370
When the time calls,
start a movement!!

8342
04:25:07,430 --> 04:25:12,370
m 150 0 l 2250 0 2250 2250 0 2250

8343
04:25:07,430 --> 04:25:12,370
m 150 0 l 2250 0 2250 2250 0 2250

8344
04:25:07,720 --> 04:25:12,370

04:30:03,110 --> 04:30:06,260
Were in the school premises at that time, right?

8534
04:30:06,300 --> 04:30:09,470
They were in the school premises !!

8535
04:30:09,470 --> 04:30:12,800
Are you bad at golf? Or are you good at it?

8536
04:30:11,010 --> 04:30:12,800
Are you bad at golf? Or are you good at it?

8537
04:30:12,800 --> 04:30:15,610
I think everyone here's not very good at it !!

8538
04:30:17,510 --> 04:30:19,310
HEY!!

8539
04:30:20,380 --> 04:30:20,500
Mr. Chono will start his own investigation to find the culprit

8540
04:30:20,500 --> 04:30:20,610
Mr. Chono will start his own investigation to find the culprit

8541
04:30:20,610 --> 04:30:20,700
Mr. Chono will start his own investigation to find the culprit

8542
04:30:20,700 --> 04:30:20,820
Mr. Chono will start his own investigation to find the culprit

8543
04:30:20,820 --> 04:30:27,460
Mr. Chono will start his own investigation to find the culprit

8544
04:30:24,080 --> 04:30:26,310
Going to play dumb, huh?

8545
04:30:28,290 --> 04:30:29,520
Today is our precious graduation ceremony, got it?

8546
04:30:29,530 --> 04:30:32,520
Today is our precious graduation ceremony, got it?

8547
04:30:32,530 --> 04:30:35,390
Today is our precious graduation ceremony, got it?

8548
04:30:35,830 --> 04:30:38,930
There is definitely one person among you who is a liar

8549
04:30:42,670 --> 04:30:44,870
Stand up

8550
04:30:50,210 --> 04:30:52,350
Are you an honest person?

8551
04:30:52,350 --> 04:30:54,780
Yes

8552
04:30:55,210 --> 04:30:56,190
Hey

8553
04:30:58,350 --> 04:31:00,350
Was it you who did it?

8554
04:31:01,160 --> 04:31:02,750
It was not me

8555
04:31:05,030 --> 04:31:06,760
Who is lying?

8556
04:31:06,760 --> 04:31:08,720
Wait...

8557
04:31:08,720 --> 04:31:09,260
HEY!!

8558
04:31:12,540 --> 04:31:14,730
What?

8559
04:31:16,730 --> 04:31:18,600
I have no idea what that means

8560
04:31:19,510 --> 04:31:20,660
Always happens

8561
04:31:22,080 --> 04:31:23,940
In the classroom, did this guy play golf?

8562
04:31:23,950 --> 04:31:26,110
In the classroom, did this guy play golf?

8563
04:31:26,620 --> 04:31:27,710
Yes

8564
04:31:27,710 --> 04:31:28,120
No

8565
04:31:28,120 --> 04:31:29,910
I have not played any golf at all

8566
04:31:29,910 --> 04:31:32,020
HEY YOU!!

8567
04:31:30,450 --> 04:31:32,020
He's lying!!

8568
04:31:34,120 --> 04:31:36,220
Just be honest about it

8569
04:31:34,920 --> 04:31:36,220
Just be honest about it

8570
04:31:37,790 --> 04:31:39,690
Who's he talking about?

8571
04:31:45,640 --> 04:31:48,640
That's right

8572
04:31:51,040 --> 04:31:52,470
Hey, wait a second!!

8573
04:31:52,470 --> 04:31:55,910
If you know something, then say it!!

8574
04:31:55,910 --> 04:31:59,180
It was because Shingo showed me his panties

8575
04:31:59,180 --> 04:32:01,690
It was because Shingo showed me his panties

8576
04:32:02,350 --> 04:32:07,050
What are you talking about?

8577
04:32:09,330 --> 04:32:12,020
What the heck is he saying?

8578
04:32:12,020 --> 04:32:13,530
An idiot

8579
04:32:13,530 --> 04:32:15,530
That's definitely right

8580
04:32:18,470 --> 04:32:21,060
None of you can be trusted

8581
04:32:23,800 --> 04:32:24,720
Eh? What?

8582
04:32:26,780 --> 04:32:28,140
HEY! Bring that out!!

8583
04:32:28,140 --> 04:32:29,410
HEY! Bring that out!!

8584
04:32:30,390 --> 04:32:32,270
What?

8585
04:32:30,880 --> 04:32:32,270
What in the world?

8586
04:32:32,410 --> 04:32:38,410
They bring out a 7 meter long golf putting course

8587
04:32:38,820 --> 04:32:40,950
This is not a game nor is it golf

8588
04:32:40,960 --> 04:32:42,320
This is not a game nor is it golf

8589
04:32:42,320 --> 04:32:43,590
This is a verification of the case!!

8590
04:32:43,590 --> 04:32:45,390
This is a verification of the case!!

8591
04:32:46,230 --> 04:32:50,090
If you can do a hole-in-one, you're not the culprit!!

8592
04:32:50,100 --> 04:32:51,660
If you can do a hole-in-one, you're not the culprit!!

8593
04:32:52,170 --> 04:32:55,820
And thus are good at golf are innocent

8594
04:32:52,170 --> 04:32:55,820
The ones who can do a hole-in-one

8595
04:32:53,010 --> 04:32:55,260
Oh man, this is...

8596
04:32:55,840 --> 04:32:57,570
If a person misses, he's the culprit!!

8597
04:32:57,570 --> 04:33:00,900
If a person misses, he's the culprit!!

8598
04:33:01,180 --> 04:33:08,010
The one who can't do a hole-in-one is the culprit

8599
04:33:01,350 --> 04:33:02,870
Are you serious?

8600
04:33:02,870 --> 04:33:06,810
This is going to be quite tough...

8601
04:33:05,190 --> 04:33:06,810
This year is also tough

8602
04:33:08,450 --> 04:33:09,810

This is nerve-wrecking

8607
04:33:12,440 --> 04:33:13,820
What, seriously?

8608
04:33:14,890 --> 04:33:16,550
Okay, you can start, Endo!!

8609
04:33:15,650 --> 04:33:16,550

8611
04:33:20,870 --> 04:33:21,890
Okay, hit it gently

8612
04:33:21,890 --> 04:33:23,100

Gently... Swing the putter

8614

Gently... Swing the putter

8615

All right!

8616
04:33:26,930 --> 04:33:28,740
This is just too...

8617
04:33:28,740 --> 04:33:30,770
I'm nervous

8618
04:33:29,370 --> 04:33:30,770
Seriously?

8619
04:33:34,700 --> 04:33:36,790
Good, nice and gentle

8620
04:33:36,800 --> 04:33:38,170

8621
04:33:38,760 --> 04:33:39,630

That's it!

8623
04:33:40,570 --> 04:33:41,720
It's floating?

8624
04:33:40,830 --> 04:33:41,260
Get in the hole! C'mon! Go!

8625
04:33:41,270 --> 04:33:41,690
Get in the hole! C'mon! Go!

8626

It went in

8628
04:33:42,650 --> 04:33:44,060
I did it!

8629
04:33:43,100 --> 04:33:47,920
Endo proves his innocence

8630
04:33:43,100 --> 04:33:47,920
Endo proves his innocence

8631
04:33:43,100 --> 04:33:47,920
Endo proves his innocence

8632
04:33:46,600 --> 04:33:47,920

Of course Hosei would make that face

8641
04:33:59,330 --> 04:34:01,130
If you miss, you're the culprit!! Get it?

8642

I felt really numb

8645
04:34:08,020 --> 04:34:10,070
Clear your mind!!

8646
04:34:08,880 --> 04:34:09,340
Right

8647
04:34:10,070 --> 04:34:11,060
Is this okay?

8648
04:34:11,060 --> 04:34:12,040
Do it!!

8649
04:34:16,940 --> 04:34:18,500
Oh, wonderful

8650
04:34:19,180 --> 04:34:20,470
What?

8651
04:34:20,470 --> 04:34:21,890
This looks to be taking a different line!?

8652
04:34:21,890 --> 04:34:23,420
Isn't the ball floating?

8653
04:34:22,240 --> 04:34:22,820
Oh!?

8654
04:34:22,820 --> 04:34:23,420

It really looked like it stopped

8662
04:34:34,380 --> 04:34:37,130
It really seemed like it stopped, but no

8663
04:34:38,000 --> 04:34:38,470

It should've stopped, what is going on??

8709
04:36:09,060 --> 04:36:09,250

That was quite close!

8718
04:36:20,680 --> 04:36:23,270
That was not it at all!!

8719
04:36:21,770 --> 04:36:23,150
It followed the line up until that point...

8720
04:36:23,150 --> 04:36:23,940
I told you, right?

8721
04:36:23,940 --> 04:36:24,670
Yeah

8722
04:36:26,910 --> 04:36:27,420
Hosei cannot prove his innocence

8723
04:36:26,910 --> 04:36:27,450
Hosei cannot prove his innocence

8724
04:36:26,910 --> 04:36:29,110
It just spun round and round... What the hell was that?!

8725
04:36:27,450 --> 04:36:32,220
Hosei cannot prove his innocence

8726
04:36:29,110 --> 04:36:30,420
There's got to be a problem with your putting!

8727
04:36:30,420 --> 04:36:32,210
No! Something about that was strange!

8728
04:36:32,820 --> 04:36:34,420
You saw it yourself!!

8729
04:36:34,420 --> 04:36:38,120
How did something like that happen?

8730
04:36:36,290 --> 04:36:36,310
How would I know that

8731
04:36:36,310 --> 04:36:36,330
How would I know that

8732
04:36:36,330 --> 04:36:36,340
How would I know that

8733
04:36:36,340 --> 04:36:36,350
How would I know that

8734
04:36:36,350 --> 04:36:36,370

8735
04:36:36,370 --> 04:36:36,400
How would I know that

04:36:36,400 --> 04:36:36,420
How would I know that

8737
04:36:36,420 --> 04:36:36,470
How would I know that

8738
04:36:36,470 --> 04:36:36,500
How would I know that

8739
04:36:36,500 --> 04:36:36,530
How would I know that

8740
04:36:36,530 --> 04:36:36,540
How would I know that

8741
04:36:36,540 --> 04:36:36,560
How would I know that

8742
04:36:36,560 --> 04:36:36,590
How would I know that

8743
04:36:36,590 --> 04:36:36,610
How would I know that

8744
04:36:36,610 --> 04:36:36,670
How would I know that

8745
04:36:36,670 --> 04:36:36,720
How would I know that

8746
04:36:36,720 --> 04:36:36,750
How would I know that

8747
04:36:36,750 --> 04:36:36,780
How would I know that

8748
04:36:36,780 --> 04:36:36,800
How would I know that

8749
04:36:36,800 --> 04:36:36,840
How would I know that

8750
04:36:36,840 --> 04:36:36,860
How would I know that

8751
04:36:36,860 --> 04:36:38,120
How would I know that

8752
04:36:38,120 --> 04:36:39,960
HEY!! Come here!!

8753
04:36:39,960 --> 04:36:40,920
HEY!! Come here!!

8754
04:36:40,920 --> 04:36:41,050
The investigation drags on onstage

8755
04:36:41,050 --> 04:36:41,150
The investigation drags on onstage

8756
04:36:41,150 --> 04:36:41,250
The investigation drags on onstage

8757
04:36:41,250 --> 04:36:41,360
The investigation drags on onstage

8758
04:36:41,360 --> 04:36:46,230
The investigation drags on onstage

8759
04:36:41,360 --> 04:36:46,230
The investigation drags on onstage

8760
04:36:44,860 --> 04:36:46,230
Confess with honesty!

8761
04:36:47,300 --> 04:36:49,560
"I'm the one who did it, I'm very sorry"

8762
04:36:49,870 --> 04:36:52,340
First, answer honestly

8763
04:36:53,280 --> 04:36:56,970
I putted an orange ball

8764
04:36:55,010 --> 04:36:56,970
I putted an orange ball

8765
04:36:58,940 --> 04:37:00,110
So you're the culprit then

8766
04:37:00,320 --> 04:37:00,380
Hosei is the culprit

8767
04:37:00,320 --> 04:37:00,380
Hosei is the culprit

8768
04:37:00,380 --> 04:37:00,450

Hosei is the culprit

8773
04:37:00,520 --> 04:37:06,950
Hosei is the culprit

8774
04:37:09,330 --> 04:37:09,750
Huh? Wait!!

8775
04:37:09,760 --> 04:37:11,490
Huh? Wait!!

8776
04:37:10,740 --> 04:37:11,490
What is it?

8777
04:37:11,490 --> 04:37:12,890
It's not what

8778
04:37:12,890 --> 04:37:13,990
You were faking it,  right!?

8779
04:37:14,010 --> 04:37:14,180

Be more honest now

8796
04:37:19,630 --> 04:37:20,500
You understand?

8797
04:37:20,870 --> 04:37:23,130
Today is your graduation ceremony, it's a day of celebration

8798
04:37:23,140 --> 04:37:24,900

Was about to ruin the ceremony

Tell you what, I'll give you a chance

8825

A chance to escape the slap

04:38:25,300 --> 04:38:31,300
A chance to escape the slap

8832
04:38:25,300 --> 04:38:31,300
A chance to escape the slap

8833
04:38:25,530 --> 04:38:28,430

If he chugs both milk bottles he's saved

If he chugs both milk bottles he's saved

8843

If he chugs both milk bottles he's saved

8844
04:38:43,090 --> 04:38:44,580
However

8845
04:38:44,850 --> 04:38:46,550
You have to chug them, one after the other

8846
04:38:46,550 --> 04:38:47,530
Got it

8847
04:38:46,550 --> 04:38:48,120

That's crazy

8866
04:39:16,570 --> 04:39:18,110
Hurry up and drink it already!

8867
04:39:18,110 --> 04:39:18,920
Go!

8868
04:39:18,390 --> 04:39:21,320

You spilled

8889
04:39:48,500 --> 04:39:53,520
Hosei failed the challenge

8890
04:39:48,500 --> 04:39:53,520
Hosei failed the challenge

8891
04:39:49,890 --> 04:39:51,110
Somebody clean the mess!

The milk mostly spilled on the ground

8898
04:40:04,730 --> 04:40:07,530
What the hell are you doing?

8899
04:40:08,510 --> 04:40:09,760
Urgh

8900

Alright

04:40:11,230 --> 04:40:13,230
Even the people behind us were laughing

8902
04:40:12,710 --> 04:40:14,600
Let's start the countdown!!

8903
04:40:22,890 --> 04:40:23,150

damn!!

8973
04:40:46,230 --> 04:40:50,650
I don't want to touch him...

8974
04:40:52,320 --> 04:40:54,540
Well it can't be helped

8975
04:40:54,920 --> 04:40:57,880
You complain too much

8976
04:40:56,510 --> 04:40:57,880
I see

8977
04:40:57,880 --> 04:40:59,280
The milk thing was too much

8978
04:41:00,440 --> 04:41:02,230
Your shoulder...

8979
04:41:01,660 --> 04:41:05,170
It's not over yet~

8980
04:41:05,170 --> 04:41:06,100
It's not over yet~

8981
04:41:06,230 --> 04:41:06,990
Eh!?

8982
04:41:08,530 --> 04:41:10,330
Well done everybody

8983
04:41:10,330 --> 04:41:11,690
Well done everybody

8984
04:41:11,690 --> 04:41:13,260
That was spectacular

8985
04:41:13,260 --> 04:41:16,330
They've assembled

8986
04:41:14,830 --> 04:41:16,330
Thank you very much

8987
04:41:16,330 --> 04:41:18,570
The 3 of them have gathered

8988
04:41:19,010 --> 04:41:20,800
Eh, what?

8989
04:41:32,180 --> 04:41:32,880
They're all here

8990
04:41:32,890 --> 04:41:34,650
What's going on?

8991
04:41:34,650 --> 04:41:36,850
We have something we want to tell you

8992
04:41:36,850 --> 04:41:40,050
This beautiful place, one last time

8993
04:41:36,850 --> 04:41:40,050
We gathered here,

8994
04:41:40,350 --> 04:41:41,770
Please have a seat

8995
04:41:44,130 --> 04:41:46,190
The slap wasn't the end?

8996
04:41:45,140 --> 04:41:46,190
What's going on?

8997
04:41:50,140 --> 04:41:55,640
This was our first time on

8998
04:41:52,740 --> 04:41:55,640
The No Laughing Batsu Game

8999
04:41:55,640 --> 04:41:58,100
To be honest I was very nervous

9000
04:41:59,010 --> 04:42:00,610
But everyone was really warm and welcoming

9001
04:42:00,610 --> 04:42:02,740
But everyone was really warm and welcoming

9002
04:42:02,740 --> 04:42:05,710
I was able to have a great time with no worries

9003
04:42:05,710 --> 04:42:08,080
We all did our best with everything we had, but

9004
04:42:08,080 --> 04:42:10,080
All of you are amazing

9005
04:42:10,090 --> 04:42:13,190
All of you are amazing for allowing us to be here

9006
04:42:11,530 --> 04:42:13,190
We're very grateful

9007
04:42:14,960 --> 04:42:16,290
With that said...

9008
04:42:16,290 --> 04:42:17,860
With that said... Until now

9009
04:42:17,860 --> 04:42:22,500
With that said... Until now everybody

9010
04:42:18,970 --> 04:42:22,500
Worked so hard without giving up

9011
04:42:22,500 --> 04:42:24,400
It's been 14 years already

9012
04:42:25,040 --> 04:42:26,630
We're really grateful for all your hard work

9013
04:42:26,630 --> 04:42:28,500
We're really grateful for all your hard work

9014
04:42:28,840 --> 04:42:31,770
You guys really have amazing teamwork

9015
04:42:31,770 --> 04:42:33,510
You guys are the best

9016
04:42:33,510 --> 04:42:35,740
For all you do to make us laugh,

9017
04:42:35,750 --> 04:42:42,420
For all you do to make us laugh, with all of our hearts

9018
04:42:39,420 --> 04:42:42,420
We're truly grateful

9019
04:42:45,960 --> 04:42:48,460
Hosei

9020
04:42:46,880 --> 04:42:47,650
Yes

9021
04:42:48,460 --> 04:42:52,460
That was the first time I witnessed Chono's slap

9022
04:42:52,470 --> 04:42:54,130
It was very impressive

9023
04:42:54,130 --> 04:42:57,700
When I was watching that segment I thought

9024
04:42:57,700 --> 04:42:59,200
Does he really need to be so against it?

9025
04:42:59,210 --> 04:43:01,500
Does he really need to be so against it?

9026
04:43:01,500 --> 04:43:05,340
I thought you were just making a big deal out of it...

9027
04:43:05,340 --> 04:43:07,310
Watching it live for the first time, for 14 years that slap

9028
04:43:07,310 --> 04:43:12,710
Watching it live for the first time, for 14 years that slap

9029
04:43:09,820 --> 04:43:12,710
Was the burden that you alone had to bear

9030
04:43:12,710 --> 04:43:17,450
There is nobody, no human who

9031
04:43:12,860 --> 04:43:13,900
What kind of face is that?

9032
04:43:13,880 --> 04:43:15,880
He's feeling so moved

9033
04:43:14,580 --> 04:43:16,550
He's moved

9034
04:43:15,420 --> 04:43:17,450
Can endure the same thing

9035
04:43:17,450 --> 04:43:19,920
Everyone shines in a different way

9036
04:43:19,930 --> 04:43:21,990
Everyone shines in a different way

9037
04:43:21,990 --> 04:43:24,760
Only Hosei can do it

9038
04:43:24,760 --> 04:43:27,460
He can do it because he is Hosei

9039
04:43:27,460 --> 04:43:29,930
I think you should be proud

9040
04:43:29,930 --> 04:43:33,430
You are a special presence in this world

9041
04:43:36,910 --> 04:43:39,110
Finally we have for you

9042
04:43:39,110 --> 04:43:40,980
We will sing our song to everyone

9043
04:43:40,980 --> 04:43:42,180
We will sing our song to everyone

9044
04:43:42,680 --> 04:43:44,310
This is a song that, to us, is very special

9045
04:43:44,320 --> 04:43:46,610
This is a song that, to us, is very special

9046
04:43:46,610 --> 04:43:52,120
It really is an amazing show,

9047
04:43:48,320 --> 04:43:50,180
Therefore I would like to

9048
04:43:50,190 --> 04:43:52,120
Therefore I would like to show my appreciation

9049
04:43:52,120 --> 04:43:55,220
With this song I will sing for you

9050
04:44:03,440 --> 04:44:05,770
What's with the musical arrangement...

9051
04:44:03,440 --> 04:44:07,770
T/N: The melody is very similar to SMAP's hit, "Sekai ni Hitotsu Dake no Hana" (The One and Only Flower in the World), but the arrangement is slightly different.

9052
04:44:17,120 --> 04:44:21,020
1 Bar of Satisfaction♪

9053
04:44:17,120 --> 04:44:21,020
Sa-Sa-Satisfaction

9054
04:44:17,120 --> 04:44:21,020
T/N: They're reciting the jingle for the "Ippon Manzoku Bar" (One Bar of Satisfaction) which is a chocolate snack bar that Kusanagi (guy on the left) did TV commercials for.

9055
04:44:20,860 --> 04:44:21,280

04:45:05,330 --> 04:45:08,330
They really aren't listening...

9094
04:45:07,970 --> 04:45:08,460
Honk

9095
04:45:12,700 --> 04:45:17,810
They were just doing whatever, is this alright?

9096
04:45:25,590 --> 04:45:27,180
Ah!!

9097
04:45:27,520 --> 04:45:29,280
That's enough

9098
04:45:29,830 --> 04:45:32,750
I have no idea anymore, none

9099
04:45:31,800 --> 04:45:32,750
I have no idea anymore, none

9100
04:45:33,960 --> 04:45:36,390
How did it even get there...

9101
04:45:43,680 --> 04:45:45,870
He was there?

9102
04:45:45,870 --> 04:45:47,130
No good

9103
04:45:48,960 --> 04:45:50,510
What an amazing map

9104
04:45:48,960 --> 04:45:52,510
T/N: The fan club for Goro, Tsuyoshi, and Shingo is called "The New Map" (Atarashii Chizu) and so Hosei is making a joke based on that name.

9105
04:45:50,510 --> 04:45:52,240
That surprised me

9106
04:45:52,240 --> 04:45:55,940
It was kind of moving...

9107
04:45:53,460 --> 04:45:55,940
Like was that alright?

9108
04:45:55,430 --> 04:45:55,940
Yes

9109
04:45:59,080 --> 04:46:02,220
There were so many things happening

9110
04:46:02,570 --> 04:46:08,220
20 hours into their school life

9111
04:46:08,920 --> 04:46:14,810
On the first Reiwa year they spent the day as high school students

9112
04:46:14,810 --> 04:46:22,470
The five men overcame all of those moments of confusion

9113
04:46:18,980 --> 04:46:22,470
The five men overcame all of those moments of confusion

9114
04:46:22,470 --> 04:46:27,610
Finally, the time has come to turn towards the moment of great joy

9115
04:46:24,060 --> 04:46:27,610
Finally, the time has come to turn towards the moment of great joy

9116
04:46:34,680 --> 04:46:36,280
Alright guys

9117
04:46:36,460 --> 04:46:39,120
Your long day of school life is finally over

9118
04:46:37,790 --> 04:46:39,120
Your long day of school life is finally over

9119
04:46:44,030 --> 04:46:47,730
Hamada, how was it?

9120
04:46:45,430 --> 04:46:46,410
Yes

9121
04:46:47,730 --> 04:46:49,700
Well we all did alright, but

9122
04:46:50,770 --> 04:46:54,040
Concerning Tanaka, a lot has happened

9123
04:46:51,870 --> 04:46:54,040
Concerning Tanaka, a lot has happened

9124
04:46:55,040 --> 04:46:57,540
Why are you bringing this up now?

9125
04:46:55,780 --> 04:46:57,540
Why are you bringing this up now?

9126
04:46:57,870 --> 04:47:00,680
He's faking it definitely

9127
04:46:59,280 --> 04:47:00,680
He's faking it definitely

9128
04:47:00,680 --> 04:47:04,250
In these recent times

9129
04:47:01,820 --> 04:47:04,250
There's someone who can fake it in such an obvious way, there really is

9130
04:47:05,320 --> 04:47:08,480
It was admirable

9131
04:47:06,210 --> 04:47:07,730
I thought so too

9132
04:47:08,480 --> 04:47:09,900
Well, shall we leave?

9133
04:47:09,900 --> 04:47:11,430
Yes

9134
04:47:10,220 --> 04:47:11,430
Yes

9135
04:47:11,430 --> 04:47:12,950
Let's go

9136
04:47:13,300 --> 04:47:14,920
Well

9137
04:47:14,920 --> 04:47:18,790
It's all over right, right?

9138
04:47:16,960 --> 04:47:18,790
It's all over right, right?

9139
04:47:17,430 --> 04:47:18,790
Though a lot has happened

9140
04:47:19,420 --> 04:47:24,050
Front of entrance

9141
04:47:19,430 --> 04:47:22,080
Gah, it's cold

9142
04:47:20,370 --> 04:47:22,460
It's so cold

9143
04:47:22,470 --> 04:47:24,050
Well done everybody!!

9144
04:47:24,050 --> 04:47:25,050
Well done!!

9145
04:47:25,420 --> 04:47:26,130
Good job

9146
04:47:25,540 --> 04:47:28,770
Heipo

9147
04:47:25,540 --> 04:47:28,770
Principal

9148
04:47:26,130 --> 04:47:26,700
Good job

9149
04:47:26,700 --> 04:47:28,770
I'm the principal, Heipo

9150
04:47:28,770 --> 04:47:31,440
I would like to celebrate this ending

9151
04:47:31,440 --> 04:47:33,570
With a riddle

9152
04:47:33,920 --> 04:47:35,840
What?

9153
04:47:34,440 --> 04:47:35,840
To everyone?

9154
04:47:35,840 --> 04:47:36,980
No?

9155
04:47:36,980 --> 04:47:38,580
No riddle?

9156
04:47:38,580 --> 04:47:40,550
We didn't say no

9157
04:47:40,550 --> 04:47:41,310
We didn't say anything

9158
04:47:41,310 --> 04:47:43,580
I never said no

9159
04:47:42,810 --> 04:47:43,580
We didn't say no

9160
04:47:43,580 --> 04:47:45,720
Then I will give you a riddle

9161
04:47:45,720 --> 04:47:46,700
Fine

9162
04:47:47,150 --> 04:47:50,120
It's a riddle connected with the school

9163
04:47:50,120 --> 04:47:50,590
Haha

9164
04:47:50,590 --> 04:47:50,790
Huu huu huu huu

9165
04:47:50,800 --> 04:47:51,020
Huu huu huu huu

9166
04:47:51,030 --> 04:47:51,190
Huu huu huu huu

9167
04:47:51,200 --> 04:47:51,990
Huu huu huu huu

9168
04:47:56,700 --> 04:47:58,050
What's so funny?

9169
04:47:58,050 --> 04:47:59,800
Really, what's so funny?

9170
04:48:00,390 --> 04:48:01,560
Whoa, scary!

9171
04:48:02,810 --> 04:48:05,570
Can I leave now? There's a moth

9172
04:48:07,450 --> 04:48:09,330
I'm leaving

9173
04:48:09,800 --> 04:48:11,280
Let's go

9174
04:48:10,330 --> 04:48:11,280
Yeah let's

9175
04:48:11,280 --> 04:48:12,410
Let's get on with it

9176
04:48:12,410 --> 04:48:14,200
Who cares

9177
04:48:14,200 --> 04:48:15,370
The hell was the point

9178
04:48:15,370 --> 04:48:16,950
For real, let's get this over with

9179
04:48:17,070 --> 04:48:25,620
Hitoshi Matsumoto

9180
04:48:17,070 --> 04:48:25,620
Hosei Tsukitei

9181
04:48:17,070 --> 04:48:25,620
Masatoshi Hamada

9182
04:48:17,070 --> 04:48:25,620
Naoki Tanaka

9183
04:48:17,070 --> 04:48:25,620
Shozo Endo

9184
04:48:17,070 --> 04:48:25,620
Times they were smacked in the butt

9185
04:48:18,530 --> 04:48:21,380
Congratulations!

9186
04:48:21,380 --> 04:48:23,380
Happy New Year!

9187
04:48:29,430 --> 04:48:30,760
Heipo!

9188
04:48:30,760 --> 04:48:33,160
Thank you for your hard work!

9189
04:48:31,610 --> 04:48:33,160
Thank you for your hard work!

9190
04:48:33,160 --> 04:48:34,530
Thank you

9191
04:48:34,530 --> 04:48:36,320
Good for you! They laughed didn't they?

9192
04:48:36,320 --> 04:48:38,320
Yes, but the moth is still scary!

9193
04:48:38,320 --> 04:48:39,100
The moth, the moth!

9194
04:48:39,100 --> 04:48:41,100
Thanks for everything!

9195
04:48:40,120 --> 04:48:41,100
What?

9196
04:48:43,000 --> 04:48:44,190
It's all OK!

9197
04:48:44,280 --> 04:48:46,080
What's going on?

9198
04:48:46,220 --> 04:48:48,820
Life has its ups and downs

9199
04:48:48,820 --> 04:48:50,480
Through whatever adversities may come

9200
04:48:50,480 --> 04:48:52,220
And things you find outrageous

9201
04:48:52,220 --> 04:48:53,990
Stoically endure

9202
04:48:53,990 --> 04:48:55,190
Don't be flustered

9203
04:48:55,190 --> 04:48:56,390
Calm down

9204
04:48:56,390 --> 04:48:57,590
And surely one day

9205
04:48:57,590 --> 04:48:58,990
We'll get through this together

9206
04:48:58,990 --> 04:49:00,830
Without looking back on the past

9207
04:49:00,830 --> 04:49:03,300
Everyone join hands in friendship

9208
04:49:03,300 --> 04:49:05,430
Let's face forward and live

9209
04:49:05,840 --> 04:49:09,580
That is your way of life

9210
04:49:12,090 --> 04:49:16,580
♪ Kore ga Watshi no Ikiru Michi
This is My Way of Life

9211
04:49:16,580 --> 04:49:23,260
Japan Rugby Team does dramatic acting

9212
04:49:23,260 --> 04:49:31,330
Somehow Kusanagi in the nude is actually nice

9213
04:49:31,330 --> 04:49:37,440
Ryunosuke gets his lines perfectly

9214
04:49:37,440 --> 04:49:41,600
Amami's absurd behavior is super sadistic

9215
04:49:41,600 --> 04:49:50,790
And the superintendent's office gets good and chaotic

9216
04:49:50,790 --> 04:50:05,140
If Tanaka was faking it, no one would be able to laugh or watch

9217
04:50:05,140 --> 04:50:12,180
Even if Kato's riot is done with a skit

9218
04:50:12,180 --> 04:50:20,420
We'll laugh and live on

9219
04:50:20,420 --> 04:50:27,160
Shiro Ito does a great performance in the bathroom

9220
04:50:27,160 --> 04:50:30,730

9221
04:50:30,730 --> 04:50:35,110
The imitations were kinda right

9222
04:50:35,110 --> 04:50:41,180
Nanno forgot some of her lines and then a good kick

9223
04:50:41,180 --> 04:50:45,580
The scenes with only members were weak

9224
04:50:45,580 --> 04:50:50,740
If you fast forward to the handsome one, it's still good

9225
04:51:06,870 --> 04:51:13,870
Showing off your panties is a bit worrisome, but

9226
04:51:13,870 --> 04:51:22,940
This is the map that I live on

9227
04:51:26,220 --> 04:51:32,500
Students yelling from the rooftop were great

9228
04:51:32,500 --> 04:51:40,400
That must've hurt, a crying Hitori, from here on out, let's work together

9229
04:51:40,400 --> 04:51:46,640
The penis gets bigger and bigger

9230
04:51:46,640 --> 04:51:54,650
Can't win naturally; Kazushige, don't be a nuisance

9231
04:51:54,650 --> 04:52:00,820
The baby gorilla from the drawer was great

9232
04:52:00,820 --> 04:52:04,940
Tetsuya really joked around a lot,

9233
04:52:05,080 --> 04:52:10,570
Chono appeared this year too, that was great

9234
04:52:10,570 --> 04:52:16,670
The first New Year's Eve of Reiwa

9235
04:52:16,670 --> 04:52:31,310
If we put the comedians first, from here on out, it'll be great

9236
04:52:31,310 --> 04:52:41,350
This one is definitely faking it

9237
04:52:41,600 --> 04:52:43,950
No I'm not!

9238
04:52:43,950 --> 04:52:44,680
Great compilation!

9239
04:52:43,990 --> 04:52:44,190

After this an important announcement

9244
04:52:44,190 --> 04:52:49,090
After this an important announcement

9245
04:52:44,680 --> 04:52:45,350
What a compilation

9246
04:52:45,350 --> 04:52:47,510
You were really targeted there

9247
04:52:46,640 --> 04:52:49,090
No, I really wasn't faking!

9248
04:52:49,640 --> 04:52:52,690
During this VTR we passed into a new year

9249
04:52:52,190 --> 04:52:53,420
Oh, really?

9250
04:52:52,960 --> 04:52:57,480
Happy New Year!

9251
04:52:53,900 --> 04:52:57,480
Happy New Year!

9252
04:52:53,900 --> 04:52:57,480
Happy New Year!

9253

Happy New Year!

9254
04:52:53,900 --> 04:52:57,480
Happy New Year!

9255
04:52:58,040 --> 04:53:00,580
So Matsumoto, how was this one for you?

9256
04:53:00,580 --> 04:53:04,070
Somehow I got through it without getting worn out

9257
04:53:02,240 --> 04:53:04,070
Somehow I got through it without getting worn out

9258
04:53:04,070 --> 04:53:06,040
It was different from the other ones

9259
04:53:06,040 --> 04:53:07,090
Yeah

9260
04:53:07,090 --> 04:53:08,540
This time there was that too!

9261
04:53:08,540 --> 04:53:10,210
The slap

9262
04:53:09,530 --> 04:53:10,840
You're really bad at putting

9263
04:53:10,840 --> 04:53:12,510
What are you saying?

9264
04:53:12,870 --> 04:53:13,880
That was only you!

9265
04:53:13,880 --> 04:53:15,460
No it wasn't!

9266
04:53:14,480 --> 04:53:16,150
Things like this happen

9267
04:53:15,810 --> 04:53:17,130
Yes, right

9268
04:53:17,130 --> 04:53:19,000
You're actually the best one in the group, right?

9269
04:53:18,220 --> 04:53:19,000
Hey, what kind of-

9270
04:53:19,000 --> 04:53:20,490
They used a machine!

9271
04:53:20,490 --> 04:53:23,130
It completely stopped,

9272
04:53:23,130 --> 04:53:24,360
The ball

9273
04:53:24,360 --> 04:53:28,000
Well, then, please continue to support Gaki no Tsukai in 2020

9274
04:53:28,000 --> 04:53:30,930
Thank you very much!
