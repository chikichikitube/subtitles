1
00:00:00,290 --> 00:00:05,630
"Who Is The Real Celebrity BASIC,
threehour programme in spring!"

2
00:00:06,080 --> 00:00:07,830
The spring grading consists of

3
00:00:07,920 --> 00:00:12,170
super basic tests that
they should obviously guess right.

4
00:00:13,460 --> 00:00:17,460
The Spring Grading consists of tests
on basic knowledge they should know.

5
00:00:17,540 --> 00:00:19,130
The correct answer is...

6
00:00:20,000 --> 00:00:22,330
For example,
in the string quartet performance,

7
00:00:23,080 --> 00:00:26,580
they'll compare the most expensive
musical instrument

8
00:00:26,670 --> 00:00:27,880
to one that lacks a string.

9
00:00:28,670 --> 00:00:31,420
The tasting test
is also a basic test

10
00:00:32,040 --> 00:00:33,710
of comparing
the finest quality squid

11
00:00:33,790 --> 00:00:37,670
to Kanetsu Delica Foods'
unreleased product, Hobohobo Ika,

12
00:00:37,750 --> 00:00:40,250
which is made with fish paste.

13
00:00:41,170 --> 00:00:42,330
Are you kidding me?

14
00:00:43,830 --> 00:00:48,080
Of course, if they get it wrong,
their rank will go down,

15
00:00:48,170 --> 00:00:50,880
and eventually
vanish from the screen at the end,

16
00:00:50,960 --> 00:00:52,290
so be careful!

17
00:00:52,580 --> 00:00:57,380
In the New Year, we asked our guests
to spot the firstrated items.

18
00:00:57,580 --> 00:01:02,830
In the Spring Grading, we'll do some
very basic tests to check whether

19
00:01:02,920 --> 00:01:06,000
you know things that a person
should naturally know or not.

20
00:01:06,170 --> 00:01:10,290
You should stay as firstrated
celebrities till the end, naturally.

21
00:01:10,380 --> 00:01:11,880
That's right...

22
00:01:12,580 --> 00:01:15,380
First, from great families,
Team Nagashima and Koizumi,

23
00:01:15,460 --> 00:01:18,790
Mr Kazushige Nagashima
and Mr Kotaro Koizumi.

24
00:01:18,960 --> 00:01:20,380
Team... Nagashima?

25
00:01:20,460 --> 00:01:22,330
Yes, Nagashima and Koizumi.
And Koizumi.

26
00:01:22,460 --> 00:01:23,580
That's right.

27
00:01:23,790 --> 00:01:25,040
Our backgrounds are powerful.

28
00:01:25,210 --> 00:01:26,960
Don't say that!

29
00:01:27,000 --> 00:01:28,540
Because we're from
powerful backgrounds.

30
00:01:28,630 --> 00:01:31,130
Maybe you are, but don't say it.

31
00:01:31,210 --> 00:01:32,250
Yeah?

32
00:01:32,460 --> 00:01:33,500
How is this?

33
00:01:33,580 --> 00:01:36,960
I bump into Mr Kazushige
at various places,

34
00:01:37,040 --> 00:01:40,250
like sports club and restaurants.
I see.

35
00:01:40,380 --> 00:01:42,000
It feels very reassuring.

36
00:01:42,040 --> 00:01:45,830
Currently, I'm not nervous at all.

37
00:01:45,920 --> 00:01:47,330
That's good.

38
00:01:47,630 --> 00:01:48,790
Will you be quiet?

39
00:01:50,000 --> 00:01:51,460
Please do your best.
Okay.

40
00:01:52,210 --> 00:01:54,170
The two gentlemen came
from the same hometown.

41
00:01:54,250 --> 00:01:55,380
Team Kagoshima,

42
00:01:55,460 --> 00:01:58,580
Mr Show Aikawa
and Mr Toshiaki Megumi.

43
00:01:59,040 --> 00:01:59,960
Are you confident?

44
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:01,000
Very confident.

45
00:02:01,750 --> 00:02:02,580
Of course.

46
00:02:02,670 --> 00:02:07,040
Then maybe Mr Show won't get
anything wrong and Mr Megumi will?

47
00:02:07,130 --> 00:02:10,000
"You host various
informational programmes

48
00:02:10,080 --> 00:02:11,830
and you don't know that?"

49
00:02:12,250 --> 00:02:15,210
Everyone will say that, right?

50
00:02:15,460 --> 00:02:17,420
You look so happy!

51
00:02:18,000 --> 00:02:19,380
You look happy!

52
00:02:20,080 --> 00:02:23,080
Next, Team Born in February,
Blood Type A,

53
00:02:23,210 --> 00:02:25,670
Mr Ryuta Sato and Miss Karina.

54
00:02:26,130 --> 00:02:28,250
Team Farfetched.
Yes.

55
00:02:28,330 --> 00:02:29,880
What's that team?

56
00:02:29,960 --> 00:02:32,040
We think so too.

57
00:02:32,170 --> 00:02:35,080
But the scale of our team is huge.

58
00:02:35,670 --> 00:02:37,250
We represent everyone in Japan

59
00:02:37,380 --> 00:02:40,000
who was born in February
and has blood type A.

60
00:02:40,130 --> 00:02:41,750
We can't lose this match.

61
00:02:42,750 --> 00:02:47,540
From Team Soccer, Mr Yoshito Okubo
and Mr Yuji Nakazawa.

62
00:02:48,500 --> 00:02:50,210
I disappeared the last time.

63
00:02:50,290 --> 00:02:53,960
I reflected on my mistake,
and got myself in shape for this.

64
00:02:54,000 --> 00:02:56,080
I'll be perfect this time,
don't worry.

65
00:02:56,210 --> 00:02:58,000
It was my condition last time.

66
00:02:58,040 --> 00:02:59,460
Are you confident?

67
00:02:59,540 --> 00:03:02,130
I'm very confident now.
Good.

68
00:03:02,880 --> 00:03:05,460
Next, Team Yokai Housemate,

69
00:03:05,540 --> 00:03:08,250
Miss Fuka Koshiba
and Miss Marika Matsumoto.

70
00:03:08,710 --> 00:03:11,170
I really love this show
and I've always watched it,

71
00:03:11,290 --> 00:03:14,960
so I'm happy, but when I'm here,
I get nervous and my throat is dry.

72
00:03:15,000 --> 00:03:17,130
You don't seem to eat much
expensive food.

73
00:03:17,250 --> 00:03:19,130
Don't say that!

74
00:03:20,420 --> 00:03:21,960
It's prejudice.

75
00:03:22,040 --> 00:03:24,540
There's no way someone from Kansai
eats nice food!

76
00:03:25,580 --> 00:03:27,580
What about you, Miss Marika?

77
00:03:27,670 --> 00:03:33,000
I'll show you my character as
a firstrated celebrity this time.

78
00:03:33,080 --> 00:03:35,000
Last time, you also...

79
00:03:35,290 --> 00:03:38,580
talked in that composed manner
and kept falling.

80
00:03:39,250 --> 00:03:40,960
That's embarrassing.

81
00:03:42,040 --> 00:03:45,040
Johnny's representative,
Team SixTONES,

82
00:03:45,170 --> 00:03:48,250
Mr Jesse and Mr Yugo Kochi.

83
00:03:48,330 --> 00:03:50,790
How do you feel?
Well, we're nervous,

84
00:03:50,880 --> 00:03:53,000
but Jesse is confident!

85
00:03:53,080 --> 00:03:54,420
Thank you.

86
00:03:54,500 --> 00:03:56,170
I was told I'll be fine
if I do that.

87
00:03:56,460 --> 00:03:57,290
And you, Kochi?

88
00:03:57,380 --> 00:03:59,580
I'm the most normal one
among SixTONES.

89
00:03:59,670 --> 00:04:00,500
He's the oldest too.

90
00:04:00,580 --> 00:04:02,670
Yes, I'm the oldest,
so I'll get the job done.

91
00:04:02,750 --> 00:04:04,170
Do your best, then.
We will.

92
00:04:04,250 --> 00:04:05,710
Okay.
Thank you.

93
00:04:06,210 --> 00:04:08,040
From Team Idols and Comedians,

94
00:04:08,130 --> 00:04:11,880
Nogizaka46 and Oideyasu Koga.

95
00:04:12,500 --> 00:04:13,500
Three ladies.

96
00:04:13,630 --> 00:04:17,880
I think Nogizaka and Oideyasu Koga
are very compatible.

97
00:04:18,290 --> 00:04:19,290
What?

98
00:04:19,380 --> 00:04:21,830
But it's possible
you will make each other fail.

99
00:04:21,960 --> 00:04:24,000
Like you guys guess it right
but they don't.

100
00:04:24,130 --> 00:04:26,420
I was a cook for five years.

101
00:04:27,790 --> 00:04:29,000
I'm confident in my taste buds.

102
00:04:29,080 --> 00:04:32,250
He worked at a pub,
but it was exploitative.

103
00:04:32,330 --> 00:04:35,290
Gosh, stop it...

104
00:04:35,380 --> 00:04:37,710
We aren't talking about
the work system!

105
00:04:39,210 --> 00:04:43,170
The difficulty of beatboxing
is even much lower...

106
00:04:44,670 --> 00:04:46,210
Good morning...

107
00:04:46,540 --> 00:04:48,330
Do it properly!

108
00:04:48,790 --> 00:04:50,170
Hey!
Impressive!

109
00:04:50,290 --> 00:04:52,130
Deceive them if possible!

110
00:04:52,210 --> 00:04:55,040
We'll make them all guess wrong.
Right?

111
00:04:55,210 --> 00:04:56,460
It was impressive.

112
00:04:56,540 --> 00:04:59,670
I'm counting on you
in the real thing.

113
00:05:01,080 --> 00:05:02,630
They'll compare professionals

114
00:05:02,710 --> 00:05:04,960
who won the second place
in an international competition,

115
00:05:05,000 --> 00:05:06,540
to comedians who only mimic.

116
00:05:08,330 --> 00:05:11,630
First, a super easy question.
This is the first test.

117
00:05:12,630 --> 00:05:14,250
It's red wine.

118
00:05:15,830 --> 00:05:16,960
In the New Year,

119
00:05:17,000 --> 00:05:20,130
celebrities had to guess
the best wine in the world.

120
00:05:20,210 --> 00:05:22,540
But this time it's the basics,

121
00:05:22,670 --> 00:05:25,960
so you'll taste
red wine and white wine

122
00:05:26,000 --> 00:05:29,000
and guess which one is red wine.

123
00:05:29,130 --> 00:05:30,130
You look down on us.

124
00:05:30,210 --> 00:05:32,630
You won't taste the red wine
in the New Year

125
00:05:32,710 --> 00:05:34,040
that costs 1 million yen,

126
00:05:34,130 --> 00:05:37,080
the table wine will be
a 3,500 yen red wine

127
00:05:37,170 --> 00:05:39,040
and a 6,000 yen white wine.

128
00:05:39,130 --> 00:05:41,170
But it's red wine and white wine!

129
00:05:41,250 --> 00:05:43,630
You can't get this wrong.
Indeed.

130
00:05:43,790 --> 00:05:45,040
It'll make me laugh.

131
00:05:46,790 --> 00:05:47,750
It's impossible.

132
00:05:49,420 --> 00:05:51,420
They will be the representatives.

133
00:05:51,500 --> 00:05:54,380
This time, Team Nagashima
and Koizumi from great families

134
00:05:54,460 --> 00:05:59,880
will cause a big incident
that'll stay in the show's history.

135
00:06:00,000 --> 00:06:02,670
Please go to the Check Room.
Thank you.

136
00:06:02,750 --> 00:06:05,130
Please do your best.
I'm counting on you.

137
00:06:05,210 --> 00:06:09,250
Please taste the red and white wine
and choose the red wine.

138
00:06:10,080 --> 00:06:12,500
They'll taste red wine
and white wine

139
00:06:12,580 --> 00:06:14,170
and say which one is red.

140
00:06:14,250 --> 00:06:16,040
It's a super basic test.

141
00:06:17,920 --> 00:06:23,130
We prepared a Spanish red wine
and an Italian white wine this time.

142
00:06:23,210 --> 00:06:25,210
"Correct: Finca L'Argata 2017"
"Wrong: Toscana, Ansonaco 2018"

143
00:06:26,330 --> 00:06:28,540
The first one is this gentleman.

144
00:06:29,880 --> 00:06:31,540
Hello.

145
00:06:32,710 --> 00:06:34,250
This is what it's like?

146
00:06:34,540 --> 00:06:37,710
Oh, Kotaro! This will matter.

147
00:06:43,960 --> 00:06:45,750
His father was a Prime Minister,

148
00:06:45,830 --> 00:06:48,580
his younger brother is a Diet member
who is a minister.

149
00:06:48,710 --> 00:06:53,880
Mr Kotaro Koizumi comes from
a grand family in real life.

150
00:06:53,960 --> 00:06:55,000
"Kotaro Koizumi"

151
00:06:55,080 --> 00:06:56,210
Are you confident?

152
00:06:56,380 --> 00:06:58,290
There's no way I'll be wrong.

153
00:06:58,420 --> 00:06:59,420
Right?

154
00:07:00,000 --> 00:07:02,040
It's red wine and white wine.

155
00:07:02,130 --> 00:07:03,330
I had it yesterday too.

156
00:07:03,460 --> 00:07:06,630
So you won't get it wrong.
That's right.

157
00:07:07,710 --> 00:07:12,420
He wears a pair of dandy sunglasses
so that he can't judge by colour.

158
00:07:12,920 --> 00:07:16,790
He looks so handsome!
So handsome!

159
00:07:17,580 --> 00:07:18,750
I'll taste it now.

160
00:07:19,170 --> 00:07:20,880
First, wine A.

161
00:07:20,960 --> 00:07:24,420
"Wine A"

162
00:07:24,500 --> 00:07:25,580
He drank it in one go.

163
00:07:25,710 --> 00:07:26,670
Is it okay?

164
00:07:29,380 --> 00:07:30,540
Okay.

165
00:07:30,710 --> 00:07:32,750
So quick!
It's cool!

166
00:07:32,830 --> 00:07:36,290
Don't change it.
Use your first inspiration.

167
00:07:36,420 --> 00:07:37,420
Okay, go.
I'll taste this.

168
00:07:37,500 --> 00:07:40,170
Next, Wine B. If you get this wrong,

169
00:07:40,250 --> 00:07:43,000
your former Prime Minister Daddy
will shout at you.

170
00:07:43,040 --> 00:07:45,670
"Wine B"

171
00:07:45,750 --> 00:07:47,790
Oh? He's confused now?

172
00:07:48,960 --> 00:07:50,380
Oh no. Oh no!

173
00:07:50,580 --> 00:07:52,330
This is bad, I think he's confused.

174
00:07:52,960 --> 00:07:54,630
It's more difficult than I thought.

175
00:07:58,130 --> 00:08:00,000
His answer is...

176
00:08:01,420 --> 00:08:02,670
The red wine is...

177
00:08:04,670 --> 00:08:05,630
A.

178
00:08:07,000 --> 00:08:09,000
I think that's fine. Yes.

179
00:08:09,830 --> 00:08:14,670
I thought it tasted more like
red wine than Pinot,

180
00:08:15,130 --> 00:08:20,290
so I knew right away
that it has to be A.

181
00:08:20,670 --> 00:08:21,500
He's fine.

182
00:08:21,580 --> 00:08:24,920
First, Mr Koizumi's answer is A.

183
00:08:26,000 --> 00:08:28,130
I'm sure it's this one.

184
00:08:29,670 --> 00:08:31,540
"Waiting room A"

185
00:08:31,630 --> 00:08:34,790
Here, he'll watch what other people
do on the screen

186
00:08:34,880 --> 00:08:36,540
and wait for the result.

187
00:08:36,630 --> 00:08:38,000
"He can watch other people
do the test"

188
00:08:38,130 --> 00:08:39,920
It's the first impression.

189
00:08:40,000 --> 00:08:44,250
You can talk now, but don't keep
going on and on during the test.

190
00:08:45,330 --> 00:08:47,670
I can't hear him
if someone else talks.

191
00:08:47,960 --> 00:08:50,210
Kazushige, you've only shown
what's bad about you.

192
00:08:52,790 --> 00:08:54,460
He scolded Kazushige for real.

193
00:08:54,960 --> 00:08:56,210
I'm so scared.

194
00:08:57,000 --> 00:08:58,290
The next one is...

195
00:08:59,080 --> 00:09:00,580
Hello.

196
00:09:01,880 --> 00:09:03,000
I'm nervous.

197
00:09:03,420 --> 00:09:06,000
It's Miss Karina.

198
00:09:08,290 --> 00:09:10,210
She made her debut
as a fashion model

199
00:09:10,290 --> 00:09:12,580
and played the protagonist
in one of the most popular dramas.

200
00:09:12,710 --> 00:09:17,000
Miss Karina is active
as a talented actress.

201
00:09:17,880 --> 00:09:18,710
How do you feel?

202
00:09:18,790 --> 00:09:21,790
I guessed the 1 million yen wine
right last time.

203
00:09:21,880 --> 00:09:25,460
This time it's red and white wine,
so I want to guess it right.

204
00:09:29,540 --> 00:09:31,710
She looks so cool.
So cool!

205
00:09:33,830 --> 00:09:35,830
First, Wine A.

206
00:09:35,920 --> 00:09:38,080
"Wine A"

207
00:09:38,170 --> 00:09:40,040
Oh, she drank a lot.

208
00:09:41,500 --> 00:09:42,540
"Hmm?"

209
00:09:44,630 --> 00:09:46,790
Is it a bit difficult?

210
00:09:49,630 --> 00:09:51,540
Next, Wine B.

211
00:09:51,920 --> 00:09:53,210
Now, it's B.

212
00:09:56,040 --> 00:09:58,000
It looks like she's sulking.

213
00:10:02,670 --> 00:10:03,920
Well?

214
00:10:04,000 --> 00:10:06,000
It's difficult?
Yes.

215
00:10:06,250 --> 00:10:07,880
I think if the next person...

216
00:10:09,000 --> 00:10:12,960
chooses B, I'm going to lose
my confidence at once.

217
00:10:13,920 --> 00:10:15,500
Which answer will she give?

218
00:10:17,170 --> 00:10:18,960
Her answer is...

219
00:10:19,540 --> 00:10:21,580
B is red wine.
They're divided.

220
00:10:21,670 --> 00:10:23,670
They're divided!
Right away!

221
00:10:25,170 --> 00:10:26,880
"Worried"

222
00:10:27,250 --> 00:10:30,000
Oops! It's dramatic already.

223
00:10:30,130 --> 00:10:35,920
B is more mellow,
it's got a bit of red wine's...

224
00:10:36,920 --> 00:10:38,670
aftertaste.

225
00:10:38,830 --> 00:10:40,880
Their opinions are divided.

226
00:10:41,460 --> 00:10:43,920
But that means
either one will go down.

227
00:10:44,000 --> 00:10:45,580
Yes, right away.

228
00:10:45,790 --> 00:10:47,000
They're different.

229
00:10:47,710 --> 00:10:49,000
It's a simple test,

230
00:10:49,080 --> 00:10:51,710
but their opinions
are already divided.

231
00:10:54,540 --> 00:10:57,130
He's not here! Are you kidding me?

232
00:10:57,920 --> 00:11:00,630
"Waiting room B"

233
00:11:00,710 --> 00:11:05,460
Oh! Are you kidding me?
We're guessing red wine, right?

234
00:11:06,040 --> 00:11:07,790
Yeah, it's red wine.

235
00:11:07,880 --> 00:11:09,080
Was it A?

236
00:11:09,830 --> 00:11:13,920
Hang on. Karina, you guessed
the 1 million yen wine right...

237
00:11:14,330 --> 00:11:16,710
Next, it's this gentleman.

238
00:11:17,580 --> 00:11:19,330
Hello. Excuse me.

239
00:11:19,500 --> 00:11:20,830
Okay, it's Jesse.

240
00:11:20,920 --> 00:11:22,540
Please, Jesse! Do your best!

241
00:11:24,210 --> 00:11:26,580
Their debut single sold
a million copies,

242
00:11:26,750 --> 00:11:29,460
the group of six represents
Johnny's next generation.

243
00:11:29,540 --> 00:11:31,580
SixTONES's Mr Jesse.

244
00:11:32,250 --> 00:11:35,630
Mr Jesse, what do you think?
They look down on us too much.

245
00:11:35,750 --> 00:11:37,420
I drink wine as well,

246
00:11:37,630 --> 00:11:40,000
I have a soft spot for wine
in a good sense.

247
00:11:40,250 --> 00:11:42,420
Okay, next.

248
00:11:42,540 --> 00:11:45,080
It's okay.
It's good.

249
00:11:46,000 --> 00:11:48,880
First, Wine A,
chosen by Kotaro Koizumi.

250
00:11:48,960 --> 00:11:55,790
"Wine A"

251
00:11:58,040 --> 00:12:00,170
"Oh"

252
00:12:00,960 --> 00:12:03,290
He doesn't look confident.
No.

253
00:12:03,830 --> 00:12:05,790
Oh, I'm worried!

254
00:12:07,080 --> 00:12:11,750
Taste the red wine and white wine
and choose the red wine. That's all!

255
00:12:12,880 --> 00:12:13,750
Okay.

256
00:12:13,920 --> 00:12:16,130
Next, Wine B, chosen by Karina.

257
00:12:16,630 --> 00:12:18,380
He drinks it up in one go.

258
00:12:18,540 --> 00:12:22,630
"Wine B"

259
00:12:23,750 --> 00:12:26,460
What?
He laughed.

260
00:12:26,750 --> 00:12:28,250
He doesn't know?
He doesn't.

261
00:12:28,330 --> 00:12:31,830
Just decide if it's red or white.
Yes, I'm counting on you!

262
00:12:33,000 --> 00:12:34,630
His answer is...

263
00:12:34,880 --> 00:12:35,710
This.

264
00:12:35,790 --> 00:12:39,250
"Wine B"

265
00:12:40,040 --> 00:12:42,130
Kotaro has a crisis!

266
00:12:42,630 --> 00:12:43,960
Wait a minute...

267
00:12:44,000 --> 00:12:49,000
B tastes richer.
It has more flavour and depth.

268
00:12:49,580 --> 00:12:54,830
It tasted like red wine
when the flavour filled my mouth.

269
00:12:54,920 --> 00:12:57,250
I see.
Good, he has a reason. It's okay.

270
00:12:57,460 --> 00:12:58,960
Two people went to B.

271
00:12:59,000 --> 00:13:00,330
Is this okay?

272
00:13:01,580 --> 00:13:02,960
Well...

273
00:13:04,290 --> 00:13:07,500
After Karina, Jesse also chose B.

274
00:13:08,080 --> 00:13:10,420
Okay, here I go.

275
00:13:12,630 --> 00:13:15,000
Thank goodness!
Thank goodness!

276
00:13:15,580 --> 00:13:17,380
Jesse, you're here.
Thank goodness!

277
00:13:17,580 --> 00:13:19,790
Jesse, you choose B?
I think it's B.

278
00:13:21,830 --> 00:13:23,080
Next, it is...

279
00:13:24,210 --> 00:13:26,380
Hello.
Okay, it's Mr Okubo.

280
00:13:26,460 --> 00:13:28,500
Yoshito!
Yoshito, do your best!

281
00:13:28,630 --> 00:13:29,790
Top scorer.

282
00:13:30,880 --> 00:13:31,920
The first striker

283
00:13:32,000 --> 00:13:35,580
who became J League's top scorer
for three years in a row,

284
00:13:35,790 --> 00:13:39,580
former player in Japan's
National Team, Mr Yoshito Okubo.

285
00:13:40,210 --> 00:13:42,380
You know there's
red wine and white wine, right?

286
00:13:42,460 --> 00:13:43,670
Sure, I do.

287
00:13:44,000 --> 00:13:46,500
Don't look down on him too much,
of course he knows.

288
00:13:46,630 --> 00:13:49,170
I had tasted and compared them once.

289
00:13:49,500 --> 00:13:50,790
They're totally different.

290
00:13:50,880 --> 00:13:53,460
I know what they're like.
I see.

291
00:13:53,540 --> 00:13:55,210
I remember it.
Okay.

292
00:13:55,710 --> 00:13:58,540
The top scorer looks so good
wearing the pair of sunglasses.

293
00:13:58,630 --> 00:14:00,130
First, it's Wine A.

294
00:14:00,210 --> 00:14:01,670
"Wine A"

295
00:14:01,750 --> 00:14:03,000
He sticks his little finger out.

296
00:14:04,500 --> 00:14:06,000
He looks so rough!

297
00:14:06,500 --> 00:14:08,830
He stuck out his little finger.

298
00:14:11,210 --> 00:14:12,130
Okay.

299
00:14:14,170 --> 00:14:15,000
Okay.

300
00:14:15,420 --> 00:14:18,460
"Lonely"

301
00:14:18,540 --> 00:14:19,580
Did you hesitate?

302
00:14:19,710 --> 00:14:23,380
But they were obviously
a bit different,

303
00:14:23,790 --> 00:14:25,080
so I thought it was B.

304
00:14:26,290 --> 00:14:29,040
Next, Wine B,
which is currently in the lead.

305
00:14:29,170 --> 00:14:30,830
Wine B.
I'm counting on you.

306
00:14:31,540 --> 00:14:35,130
Okubo played for Spain, the place
that produces good quality wine.

307
00:14:35,210 --> 00:14:38,000
He should naturally know
the answer, but...

308
00:14:38,630 --> 00:14:39,500
What?

309
00:14:40,080 --> 00:14:41,000
What?

310
00:14:41,210 --> 00:14:42,630
What?
They're the same!

311
00:14:44,750 --> 00:14:45,670
What?

312
00:14:46,500 --> 00:14:48,040
I know it's hard to choose.

313
00:14:48,880 --> 00:14:49,920
He can't decide.

314
00:14:51,880 --> 00:14:54,540
Hang on. Hang on.

315
00:14:57,040 --> 00:14:59,880
He'll only say
whether it's red or white.

316
00:15:00,000 --> 00:15:01,330
It's okay, you can do it.

317
00:15:02,210 --> 00:15:04,210
He couldn't decide,
but his answer is...

318
00:15:05,710 --> 00:15:06,540
It's A.

319
00:15:06,630 --> 00:15:08,460
Oh!
He said A.

320
00:15:09,000 --> 00:15:09,880
A.

321
00:15:11,460 --> 00:15:13,380
"Feels safe"

322
00:15:13,460 --> 00:15:15,540
What? It's different.

323
00:15:15,790 --> 00:15:18,000
It's two and two?
Two and two.

324
00:15:18,380 --> 00:15:20,710
They taste almost the same,

325
00:15:20,790 --> 00:15:24,790
but the aftertaste of A
was more astringent.

326
00:15:25,210 --> 00:15:26,790
The opinions are divided.

327
00:15:26,880 --> 00:15:29,500
Divided!
This is interesting!

328
00:15:32,000 --> 00:15:37,540
The proud top scorer of Japan
can't miss this easy goal!

329
00:15:38,000 --> 00:15:39,710
It makes me so nervous.

330
00:15:42,790 --> 00:15:43,960
Yes!

331
00:15:44,170 --> 00:15:45,540
Good!
I'm happy.

332
00:15:45,830 --> 00:15:47,250
I'm so happy!

333
00:15:47,500 --> 00:15:50,580
Sorry, I can't shake your hands,
but that's how happy I am.

334
00:15:50,790 --> 00:15:51,880
I'm so happy.

335
00:15:52,000 --> 00:15:54,830
That's rather scary.
Yes, I was here alone.

336
00:15:54,920 --> 00:15:56,080
Hello.
Oh no...

337
00:15:56,170 --> 00:15:57,500
It's twototwo!

338
00:15:59,830 --> 00:16:02,880
Is the correct answer A or B?

339
00:16:04,330 --> 00:16:06,170
Next, it's this gentleman.

340
00:16:06,670 --> 00:16:07,670
It's Mr Show.

341
00:16:07,750 --> 00:16:08,790
He's here!
He's here!

342
00:16:08,960 --> 00:16:10,210
Here comes Mr Show.

343
00:16:10,290 --> 00:16:12,130
I'm counting on you, Big Bro!

344
00:16:12,750 --> 00:16:13,670
Please do it!

345
00:16:14,130 --> 00:16:15,710
Will Mr Show know?

346
00:16:16,380 --> 00:16:19,500
Debuted as a member
of Isseifubi Sepia,

347
00:16:19,790 --> 00:16:26,380
the VCinema Emperor, Mr Show Aikawa
has appeared in over 100 movies.

348
00:16:26,460 --> 00:16:27,790
"Show Aikawa"

349
00:16:27,960 --> 00:16:30,170
Mr Show, do you usually drink wine?

350
00:16:30,250 --> 00:16:31,750
Not at all.

351
00:16:31,880 --> 00:16:33,130
You don't?
No.

352
00:16:33,210 --> 00:16:34,920
I don't drink wine at all,

353
00:16:35,000 --> 00:16:38,630
but I know if the wine tastes good.

354
00:16:38,920 --> 00:16:41,920
So you'll know
whether it's red or white at once?

355
00:16:42,000 --> 00:16:44,790
Of course I will.
Red and white are...

356
00:16:44,880 --> 00:16:47,500
Mr Show...
Is that okay?

357
00:16:47,580 --> 00:16:49,330
Is that okay?

358
00:16:49,630 --> 00:16:51,920
You say you'll know?

359
00:16:52,000 --> 00:16:53,710
They're different colours.

360
00:16:53,790 --> 00:16:56,250
No, you won't see its colour.

361
00:16:56,330 --> 00:16:59,460
Is this okay?
Mr Show.

362
00:16:59,670 --> 00:17:01,330
Everyone worries about you.

363
00:17:01,540 --> 00:17:03,380
This is bad.

364
00:17:05,580 --> 00:17:08,790
Everyone teased Mr Show Aikawa.

365
00:17:08,880 --> 00:17:10,880
Pay attention to how he looks
in sunglasses.

366
00:17:12,170 --> 00:17:15,960
He wore it.
I've seen this before.

367
00:17:16,130 --> 00:17:18,040
It suddenly looks like VCinema.

368
00:17:19,580 --> 00:17:21,330
It really is VCinema.

369
00:17:22,210 --> 00:17:25,170
He's well known as a heavy drinker
among celebrities,

370
00:17:25,250 --> 00:17:27,210
but we're worried about wine.

371
00:17:27,290 --> 00:17:30,330
"Wine A"

372
00:17:30,420 --> 00:17:33,080
He only needs to choose
whether it's red or white.

373
00:17:35,290 --> 00:17:37,380
I hope Mr Show will come here.

374
00:17:37,830 --> 00:17:39,170
Which one will Mr Show choose?

375
00:17:40,710 --> 00:17:43,000
He also drinks Wine B coolly.

376
00:17:43,040 --> 00:17:49,790
"Wine B"

377
00:17:50,420 --> 00:17:52,000
Which one?
Which one?

378
00:17:52,790 --> 00:17:53,670
Which one?

379
00:17:53,750 --> 00:17:54,880
He doesn't know.

380
00:17:55,920 --> 00:17:56,960
Right?

381
00:17:57,000 --> 00:17:58,170
It's a bit doubtful.

382
00:17:59,500 --> 00:18:01,540
His answer is...

383
00:18:02,630 --> 00:18:03,540
B.

384
00:18:10,500 --> 00:18:11,630
Are you kidding me?

385
00:18:12,080 --> 00:18:13,830
Yes!

386
00:18:14,000 --> 00:18:15,460
Yay!

387
00:18:16,080 --> 00:18:17,750
It's the astringency.

388
00:18:18,920 --> 00:18:20,080
Somehow...

389
00:18:21,040 --> 00:18:24,670
The flavour exploded in my mouth
after I drank it.

390
00:18:24,750 --> 00:18:27,000
Yes, that's right.
That's right.

391
00:18:27,040 --> 00:18:28,920
Really?
Did it explode in your mouth?

392
00:18:29,920 --> 00:18:30,880
No.

393
00:18:32,000 --> 00:18:35,040
Big Bro Aikawa
doesn't usually drink wine

394
00:18:35,170 --> 00:18:38,290
so we're a bit worried,
but now B is in the lead.

395
00:18:40,380 --> 00:18:43,040
Wow!
Thank goodness!

396
00:18:43,580 --> 00:18:45,880
It's B, right?
Right?

397
00:18:46,080 --> 00:18:48,130
Mr Show chose B.

398
00:18:48,290 --> 00:18:50,130
I wish he had come here.

399
00:18:51,080 --> 00:18:53,790
Room A gets worried again.

400
00:18:54,540 --> 00:18:55,830
The next one is...

401
00:19:00,500 --> 00:19:03,920
Okay, it's Miss Marika Matsumoto.

402
00:19:04,420 --> 00:19:06,080
She was on top of the actresses

403
00:19:06,170 --> 00:19:08,790
in the first half
of the year's ranking last year.

404
00:19:08,880 --> 00:19:12,670
Miss Marika Matsumoto
always boasts when she talks.

405
00:19:12,920 --> 00:19:14,500
Miss Marika, what do you think?
Yes.

406
00:19:14,750 --> 00:19:17,750
I think it's a problem
before common knowledge.

407
00:19:19,460 --> 00:19:22,500
I don't even need to smell it,

408
00:19:22,630 --> 00:19:25,040
there's no way I wouldn't know.
Right?

409
00:19:28,380 --> 00:19:29,500
She's cute.

410
00:19:31,790 --> 00:19:33,380
She probably embezzles money.

411
00:19:37,330 --> 00:19:39,380
First, Wine A.

412
00:19:39,500 --> 00:19:42,790
"Wine A"

413
00:19:42,880 --> 00:19:44,500
She drank it in one go.

414
00:19:49,330 --> 00:19:51,830
She nods.

415
00:19:52,420 --> 00:19:54,920
It's quick.
She's confident.

416
00:19:55,000 --> 00:19:56,540
I can't trust her somehow.

417
00:19:56,670 --> 00:19:58,210
It looks like she knows.

418
00:19:59,000 --> 00:20:02,750
Miss Marika is confident,
she tastes Wine B next.

419
00:20:02,920 --> 00:20:09,000
"Wine B"

420
00:20:09,040 --> 00:20:10,920
That reaction just now was big.

421
00:20:11,580 --> 00:20:12,460
Oh?

422
00:20:14,630 --> 00:20:17,170
I know. I know why you're confused.

423
00:20:18,000 --> 00:20:18,920
Oh?

424
00:20:19,580 --> 00:20:20,420
Oh?

425
00:20:21,420 --> 00:20:22,670
What?

426
00:20:26,170 --> 00:20:28,380
Which one will she choose?

427
00:20:28,750 --> 00:20:31,000
Her answer after hesitating is...

428
00:20:31,500 --> 00:20:35,000
Oh! Now it's three to three!
Wow!

429
00:20:35,080 --> 00:20:36,710
That's impressive!

430
00:20:36,790 --> 00:20:38,040
Now we can't tell.

431
00:20:38,330 --> 00:20:43,000
Good...
Good...

432
00:20:43,290 --> 00:20:46,500
It's three to three?
It's divided.

433
00:20:48,710 --> 00:20:50,330
When I tasted B,

434
00:20:51,380 --> 00:20:53,000
it was very astringent,

435
00:20:53,460 --> 00:20:56,040
so I thought it was red,

436
00:20:57,790 --> 00:21:00,920
but the impact of the first one
was very strong.

437
00:21:01,080 --> 00:21:03,130
That's amazing!
They're completely divided.

438
00:21:03,210 --> 00:21:05,460
They divided into three and three.
Yes.

439
00:21:05,580 --> 00:21:07,580
Maybe we should do this
in the New Year too.

440
00:21:08,960 --> 00:21:11,500
Yes, the very first question
is good.

441
00:21:11,580 --> 00:21:13,960
It's perfect.
It is.

442
00:21:14,580 --> 00:21:16,460
It's only to taste the red wine
and white wine

443
00:21:16,540 --> 00:21:20,040
and choose the red one,
the development is incredible.

444
00:21:22,790 --> 00:21:24,170
"Delighted"

445
00:21:24,250 --> 00:21:25,080
We've been waiting.

446
00:21:25,170 --> 00:21:26,540
Only the few of us?

447
00:21:26,630 --> 00:21:28,580
It's perfectly three to three.

448
00:21:28,790 --> 00:21:29,630
Three to three.

449
00:21:29,710 --> 00:21:31,130
Well.

450
00:21:31,250 --> 00:21:33,790
Mr Koizumi, you're confident, right?

451
00:21:33,920 --> 00:21:38,460
Even when I think back now,
I'm sure A was the red wine.

452
00:21:38,540 --> 00:21:41,420
Yes, you'll be okay.
I see.

453
00:21:41,630 --> 00:21:44,710
Miss Karina, you chose the other.
What do you think?

454
00:21:44,790 --> 00:21:47,790
B had an aftertaste,

455
00:21:47,880 --> 00:21:51,670
the aroma that I smelt
was like red wine.

456
00:21:52,540 --> 00:21:54,420
Hello...
Hello...

457
00:21:54,500 --> 00:21:56,040
"Is the red wine A or B?"

458
00:21:56,130 --> 00:21:57,920
The correct answer is...

459
00:22:00,130 --> 00:22:03,210
Our last participants
finally make their appearance.

460
00:22:04,080 --> 00:22:06,210
Hello...
Hello...

461
00:22:06,290 --> 00:22:08,540
The last team!
Here they are.

462
00:22:09,000 --> 00:22:11,380
It'll depend on them.

463
00:22:12,000 --> 00:22:14,710
M1 Grand Prix 2020 finalists,

464
00:22:14,880 --> 00:22:18,670
talented solo comedian duo,
Oideyasu Koga.

465
00:22:18,790 --> 00:22:20,040
What about you, gentlemen?

466
00:22:20,130 --> 00:22:22,500
There's no way we'll get it wrong.

467
00:22:22,580 --> 00:22:24,830
Exactly, in the usual case.

468
00:22:25,000 --> 00:22:28,630
We'll make them regret
making this a test.

469
00:22:30,040 --> 00:22:31,880
Seriously.
Good!

470
00:22:32,040 --> 00:22:34,040
Of course.
Of course.

471
00:22:35,210 --> 00:22:37,000
First, Wine A.

472
00:22:37,080 --> 00:22:43,880
"Wine A"

473
00:22:45,210 --> 00:22:46,460
I see.
Okay.

474
00:22:48,630 --> 00:22:49,920
"Wine B"

475
00:22:50,000 --> 00:22:51,670
Next, Wine B.

476
00:22:53,790 --> 00:22:55,460
It's fast.
Do they know?

477
00:22:59,000 --> 00:23:00,630
Kogaken knows.

478
00:23:00,710 --> 00:23:03,630
Kogaken knows.
He got it quickly.

479
00:23:04,380 --> 00:23:07,670
Kogaken is sure he's right and nods,

480
00:23:08,330 --> 00:23:10,580
and Oda is only staring
into the void.

481
00:23:10,670 --> 00:23:12,080
"In a trance"

482
00:23:12,630 --> 00:23:14,880
Will they choose A?

483
00:23:15,380 --> 00:23:16,670
Or B?

484
00:23:18,170 --> 00:23:19,830
Their answers are...

485
00:23:21,000 --> 00:23:23,210
They're different!

486
00:23:23,540 --> 00:23:25,500
That's amazing!
Wow!

487
00:23:25,580 --> 00:23:27,790
They're different.

488
00:23:27,880 --> 00:23:29,830
I'm getting a bit worried.

489
00:23:31,580 --> 00:23:34,290
Wow... Is that so?

490
00:23:37,330 --> 00:23:39,080
They're different.

491
00:23:39,290 --> 00:23:43,170
I tasted astringency in B.

492
00:23:43,420 --> 00:23:44,330
I see.

493
00:23:44,750 --> 00:23:48,420
B tastes more fruity.

494
00:23:49,130 --> 00:23:50,130
That?

495
00:23:50,500 --> 00:23:52,710
I think A was more fruity.
That's right.

496
00:23:53,170 --> 00:23:56,830
Please let me tell you,
I'm very confident.

497
00:23:56,960 --> 00:23:58,040
I see.

498
00:23:58,130 --> 00:23:59,540
Kogaken, do your best.

499
00:23:59,920 --> 00:24:01,040
We'll choose B, then.

500
00:24:01,250 --> 00:24:02,630
Oda went along with him.

501
00:24:02,790 --> 00:24:04,380
Yes.
B...

502
00:24:04,460 --> 00:24:05,960
Which one? Please...

503
00:24:06,000 --> 00:24:08,330
A obviously was the red wine.

504
00:24:08,420 --> 00:24:09,960
Exactly.

505
00:24:10,040 --> 00:24:10,920
B...

506
00:24:11,000 --> 00:24:15,380
But can their opinions be so divided
on whether the wine is red or white?

507
00:24:16,000 --> 00:24:18,080
Hello. Hello.

508
00:24:18,460 --> 00:24:19,420
It's surprisingly few!

509
00:24:19,500 --> 00:24:20,920
It's half and half.

510
00:24:21,000 --> 00:24:23,750
It's perfectly two halves.
Half and half!

511
00:24:23,960 --> 00:24:25,080
I'm sure it's this.

512
00:24:25,170 --> 00:24:27,960
It has to be.
Its flavour was different.

513
00:24:28,040 --> 00:24:29,790
Is he so confident?

514
00:24:29,880 --> 00:24:32,380
But the people in Room B
could've been deceived.

515
00:24:32,540 --> 00:24:33,670
That's right.

516
00:24:34,630 --> 00:24:37,790
The fateful announcement
of the result!

517
00:24:38,000 --> 00:24:39,880
Thank you for your patience.

518
00:24:39,960 --> 00:24:43,960
Celeb Master will go to the room
of the correct answer. Please wait.

519
00:24:44,920 --> 00:24:47,540
Here I am!

520
00:24:49,960 --> 00:24:50,960
Please come here!

521
00:24:51,000 --> 00:24:53,130
Please come here!

522
00:24:54,000 --> 00:24:55,080
Please!

523
00:24:55,210 --> 00:24:56,080
Please!

524
00:24:56,750 --> 00:24:58,460
Master, please!

525
00:24:59,460 --> 00:25:03,250
I'll open the door
of the correct answer's room.

526
00:25:04,380 --> 00:25:05,630
Please.
Please

527
00:25:06,670 --> 00:25:09,000
Please come!
Please...

528
00:25:09,130 --> 00:25:11,380
Please!
We want to stay firstclass!

529
00:25:13,250 --> 00:25:15,000
The correct answer is...

530
00:25:15,380 --> 00:25:17,130
"Waiting room A"

531
00:25:17,210 --> 00:25:18,420
Please come here.

532
00:25:18,500 --> 00:25:20,040
"Waiting room B"

533
00:25:20,130 --> 00:25:21,710
What...

534
00:25:23,790 --> 00:25:27,040
Yay!

535
00:25:27,130 --> 00:25:30,130
Yay!

536
00:25:30,380 --> 00:25:32,210
"B: Correct"

537
00:25:32,290 --> 00:25:35,790
Yay!

538
00:25:35,880 --> 00:25:40,920
"A: Wrong"

539
00:25:41,000 --> 00:25:42,130
Are you kidding me?

540
00:25:44,210 --> 00:25:46,960
Hey!
Wow!

541
00:25:47,080 --> 00:25:49,330
Yay!
Yay!

542
00:25:49,540 --> 00:25:53,290
Wow!
Amazing!

543
00:25:55,290 --> 00:25:56,130
That's right.

544
00:25:56,210 --> 00:25:58,500
Mr Show, everyone thought
you wouldn't know,

545
00:25:58,580 --> 00:26:00,080
because you don't drink wine.

546
00:26:00,170 --> 00:26:01,830
I knew when I drank it in one go.

547
00:26:01,920 --> 00:26:04,250
I see. Miss Karina, you too.

548
00:26:04,330 --> 00:26:08,540
I often buy a pack of six bottles
of red wine online,

549
00:26:08,630 --> 00:26:10,210
it was worth doing.

550
00:26:10,290 --> 00:26:13,080
Kogaken, it was brilliant.
I was very sure.

551
00:26:13,170 --> 00:26:16,000
I tasted the astringency of tannin,
so I chose B!

552
00:26:17,130 --> 00:26:18,960
Congratulations!

553
00:26:19,000 --> 00:26:20,380
Let's go back.

554
00:26:20,460 --> 00:26:22,750
Yay!
Yes!

555
00:26:23,670 --> 00:26:26,460
The correct answer is,
B is the red wine.

556
00:26:27,420 --> 00:26:32,920
This red wine has a nostalgic,
calming aroma and flavour,

557
00:26:33,040 --> 00:26:35,580
its smooth texture
and harmonised taste

558
00:26:35,670 --> 00:26:36,750
are its characteristic.

559
00:26:37,670 --> 00:26:43,290
And A is a real white wine
made from white grapes.

560
00:26:43,880 --> 00:26:48,750
The aroma of this white wine
resembles red wine,

561
00:26:48,960 --> 00:26:52,330
but if someone drinks wine often,
they should be able to tell.

562
00:26:54,380 --> 00:26:58,830
People who got it right are back!
Well done.

563
00:26:59,080 --> 00:27:02,080
Wonderful!

564
00:27:02,380 --> 00:27:04,580
Thank you.
Wonderful.

565
00:27:04,960 --> 00:27:07,790
Thank you.

566
00:27:07,880 --> 00:27:10,130
It was brilliant.
Well done.

567
00:27:10,460 --> 00:27:14,420
People who chose the wrong answer
are back. Come in.

568
00:27:14,960 --> 00:27:17,000
Oh? It's tiny.

569
00:27:17,080 --> 00:27:18,750
"Wrong answer entrance"

570
00:27:18,830 --> 00:27:20,130
This is how it is?

571
00:27:20,210 --> 00:27:21,790
Thank you.

572
00:27:22,040 --> 00:27:23,500
Thank you.

573
00:27:23,580 --> 00:27:24,670
It's okay.

574
00:27:24,790 --> 00:27:28,460
Please have a seat.
I'm sorry.

575
00:27:28,670 --> 00:27:31,460
I'm sorry.
I think it was difficult.

576
00:27:31,580 --> 00:27:32,500
I'm sorry.

577
00:27:32,630 --> 00:27:34,420
Mr Koizumi, how was it?

578
00:27:34,580 --> 00:27:36,540
I had no idea
it was so embarrassing.

579
00:27:37,080 --> 00:27:39,420
So embarrassing!

580
00:27:40,540 --> 00:27:42,880
Next, a string quartet performance.

581
00:27:42,960 --> 00:27:43,830
But...

582
00:27:44,250 --> 00:27:46,330
The wrong answer has one string...

583
00:27:46,710 --> 00:27:49,500
and this has two strings missing!

584
00:27:51,000 --> 00:27:54,880
Wow, this is bad! We already have
three teams of common celebrities!

585
00:27:54,960 --> 00:27:58,830
But there'll be more drama,
a spring storm is coming!

586
00:27:58,920 --> 00:28:00,000
The next test is...

587
00:28:00,130 --> 00:28:01,710
"String quartet"

588
00:28:01,790 --> 00:28:03,500
String quartet performance.

589
00:28:05,420 --> 00:28:08,000
In the New Year, celebrities
had to choose the performance

590
00:28:08,080 --> 00:28:10,000
with musical instruments that cost
a few billion yen.

591
00:28:10,040 --> 00:28:12,040
This time,
we test you on the basics,

592
00:28:12,130 --> 00:28:14,500
so the level is much lower.
I see.

593
00:28:14,790 --> 00:28:15,920
The correct answer is

594
00:28:16,000 --> 00:28:18,380
a performance
with string instruments

595
00:28:18,460 --> 00:28:19,920
used by professionals,

596
00:28:20,000 --> 00:28:23,460
and the other one is a performance
with string instruments

597
00:28:23,540 --> 00:28:27,000
with one or two missing strings.

598
00:28:27,830 --> 00:28:33,420
You can't even call it music.
It's noise to music lovers.

599
00:28:33,540 --> 00:28:34,670
That's right.

600
00:28:35,540 --> 00:28:40,460
A quartet performance of
two violins, a viola, and a cello.

601
00:28:41,540 --> 00:28:43,920
Both answers will be performed

602
00:28:44,000 --> 00:28:47,170
by an internationallyacclaimed
string quartet,

603
00:28:47,250 --> 00:28:49,330
Quartet Integra.

604
00:28:49,420 --> 00:28:51,040
"Quartet Integra"

605
00:28:51,830 --> 00:28:55,250
The correct answer is performed
with firstrated string instruments

606
00:28:55,330 --> 00:28:57,960
that cost a total of
250 million yen.

607
00:28:58,540 --> 00:29:00,130
This time, the wrong answer

608
00:29:00,210 --> 00:29:03,790
is done by cheap string instruments
for beginners,

609
00:29:04,130 --> 00:29:08,330
and all four string instruments
have one missing string.

610
00:29:09,040 --> 00:29:13,380
Among them, one violin
has two strings missing.

611
00:29:14,330 --> 00:29:16,710
A performance of string instruments
with missing strings

612
00:29:16,880 --> 00:29:19,790
can't be called music!

613
00:29:20,130 --> 00:29:21,960
Whether it's played
with decent string instruments

614
00:29:22,000 --> 00:29:24,040
or ones with strings missing.

615
00:29:24,170 --> 00:29:25,790
Just choose between the two.
Wait.

616
00:29:25,880 --> 00:29:27,580
That's all.

617
00:29:27,670 --> 00:29:30,380
If you listen to sounds of a string
instrument with a missing string,

618
00:29:30,460 --> 00:29:31,500
you can't tell?

619
00:29:31,580 --> 00:29:34,000
Wait...

620
00:29:34,040 --> 00:29:36,880
Usually people wouldn't listen
to that.

621
00:29:37,130 --> 00:29:39,130
Mr Hamada, I have a question.
What is it?

622
00:29:39,210 --> 00:29:41,580
Even if the string instruments
have one or two strings missing,

623
00:29:41,710 --> 00:29:43,920
and if they're so professional
that we can't tell the difference,

624
00:29:44,000 --> 00:29:47,040
they'll probably play
with another string to deceive us,

625
00:29:47,130 --> 00:29:49,000
and the bow won't be caught
by the string?

626
00:29:49,040 --> 00:29:51,580
It'll make weird sounds if it does,
so they'll play it skilfully.

627
00:29:51,670 --> 00:29:53,130
They'll play skilfully?
Of course.

628
00:29:53,210 --> 00:29:57,080
But even if they do, the sounds
from the missing string are missing.

629
00:29:57,170 --> 00:29:58,710
No, I played cello last year

630
00:29:58,790 --> 00:29:59,830
Shut up!

631
00:30:04,380 --> 00:30:05,920
The people here will do

632
00:30:06,000 --> 00:30:09,080
the easiest test
in the history of our music test.

633
00:30:09,170 --> 00:30:13,580
You only need to give
the correct answer quickly here.

634
00:30:14,330 --> 00:30:17,710
Representatives, please go
to the room to have a rest.

635
00:30:18,000 --> 00:30:19,040
Thank you.

636
00:30:19,210 --> 00:30:22,080
Please do your best.
Please do your best.

637
00:30:22,630 --> 00:30:24,250
Keep your rank there!

638
00:30:24,420 --> 00:30:25,830
Everyone, stay at that rank.

639
00:30:27,920 --> 00:30:29,750
Which quartet performance is played

640
00:30:29,830 --> 00:30:33,250
with firstrated string instruments
with all four strings?

641
00:30:34,420 --> 00:30:38,080
These four teams
will be tested first.

642
00:30:39,330 --> 00:30:41,130
Let's start our test!
Here they are.

643
00:30:42,040 --> 00:30:42,960
Okay.

644
00:30:44,000 --> 00:30:46,630
He's a former pro baseball player,

645
00:30:46,710 --> 00:30:49,540
and now works
as a multitalented entertainer.

646
00:30:49,960 --> 00:30:54,420
Mr Kazushige's only fault is that
he always says things uncalledfor.

647
00:30:55,130 --> 00:30:59,040
I listened to violin performances
a lot last year,

648
00:30:59,580 --> 00:31:01,250
it was on a television show.

649
00:31:01,330 --> 00:31:04,130
I listened to live performances
of string instruments

650
00:31:04,580 --> 00:31:07,000
played by Chisako
and Miss Hirotsuru.

651
00:31:07,080 --> 00:31:08,420
I think I can do it.
I see.

652
00:31:09,330 --> 00:31:12,830
The first protagonist he played
was in the drama "ROOKIES,"

653
00:31:12,920 --> 00:31:14,540
which was very popular.

654
00:31:14,630 --> 00:31:17,330
Talented actor Mr Ryuta Sato
also appeared

655
00:31:17,420 --> 00:31:19,170
in many other popular titles.

656
00:31:19,250 --> 00:31:22,580
I really love music,
and I listen to various genres,

657
00:31:22,670 --> 00:31:24,170
so I really want to get this right.

658
00:31:24,250 --> 00:31:26,540
That's right,
and she got the first one right.

659
00:31:26,630 --> 00:31:30,960
She built a comfortable path for me,
so I'd like to continue on that.

660
00:31:31,670 --> 00:31:35,080
She played her first protagonist
in the first movie she starred in,

661
00:31:35,170 --> 00:31:36,540
and received the Blue Ribbon Award

662
00:31:36,630 --> 00:31:38,670
for the Best Newcomer
for "Kiki's Delivery Service."

663
00:31:38,960 --> 00:31:42,630
Young actress Miss Fuka Koshiba
represents the next generation.

664
00:31:43,080 --> 00:31:45,500
I cleaned my ears just now,
so I can hear clearly.

665
00:31:46,630 --> 00:31:48,330
What the heck?

666
00:31:48,500 --> 00:31:50,460
Yeah? Okay.

667
00:31:51,330 --> 00:31:54,670
X JAPAN's YOSHIKI produced
their debut song,

668
00:31:54,790 --> 00:31:59,380
leader of Johnny's popular group
SixTONES, Mr Yugo Kochi.

669
00:31:59,880 --> 00:32:03,880
I've been listening to songs
of SixTONES that use violin,

670
00:32:03,960 --> 00:32:07,210
so if I believe the music I always
listen to when I go to the room,

671
00:32:07,290 --> 00:32:08,170
then I'll be fine.

672
00:32:08,420 --> 00:32:10,170
I'll be okay.
I see!

673
00:32:10,330 --> 00:32:11,460
That's right.
Go!

674
00:32:12,920 --> 00:32:15,920
Viewers, please think together
with them.

675
00:32:17,380 --> 00:32:19,790
We'll also listen
to the performance.

676
00:32:20,250 --> 00:32:23,630
There'll be one or two strings
missing.

677
00:32:25,210 --> 00:32:27,460
First, string quartet performance A.

678
00:32:27,540 --> 00:32:31,920
"String quartet performance A"

679
00:33:29,710 --> 00:33:31,920
This is Performance A.

680
00:33:32,080 --> 00:33:33,420
I see.
I see.

681
00:33:35,170 --> 00:33:37,670
Next, string quartet performance B.

682
00:33:37,790 --> 00:33:41,380
"String quartet performance B"

683
00:34:38,170 --> 00:34:41,460
This has been Performance B.
Totally different.

684
00:34:41,630 --> 00:34:43,170
What do you think?

685
00:34:43,250 --> 00:34:46,290
I agreed with Mr Show.

686
00:34:46,420 --> 00:34:48,290
Please ask Mr Show, it's the same.

687
00:34:48,790 --> 00:34:50,000
Which one is correct?

688
00:34:50,040 --> 00:34:52,710
I think B had more depth.
I see.

689
00:34:52,790 --> 00:34:53,710
It had more depth,

690
00:34:53,790 --> 00:34:56,210
which means no missing string.
I see.

691
00:34:56,330 --> 00:34:58,330
Does anyone agree?
Me.

692
00:34:58,460 --> 00:34:59,880
A lacks something.

693
00:35:00,000 --> 00:35:01,460
A lacks something.

694
00:35:01,580 --> 00:35:04,040
You're saying
the correct answer is B?

695
00:35:04,540 --> 00:35:08,460
You choose A?
The volume of B was smaller,

696
00:35:08,540 --> 00:35:12,040
so they were trying not to get
the bow caught to cover it up.

697
00:35:12,130 --> 00:35:13,000
I see.

698
00:35:13,040 --> 00:35:17,130
On the contrary,
I think A had more depth,

699
00:35:17,210 --> 00:35:21,210
the sound of its bass...

700
00:35:21,330 --> 00:35:24,920
I think it's obviously richer in A.

701
00:35:25,540 --> 00:35:27,170
We argue this much here?

702
00:35:28,250 --> 00:35:30,170
Over there...
What's the point of that?

703
00:35:30,250 --> 00:35:32,250
They're going to fight hard there.

704
00:35:32,960 --> 00:35:35,250
More people chose B at the studio.

705
00:35:35,420 --> 00:35:38,460
Kazushige had listened to Chisako
Takashima play violin many times,

706
00:35:38,540 --> 00:35:40,290
which one will he choose?

707
00:35:40,580 --> 00:35:42,790
This is Mr Kazushige.

708
00:35:43,210 --> 00:35:44,920
I think it's B.

709
00:35:47,040 --> 00:35:48,630
His answer is...

710
00:35:50,170 --> 00:35:51,080
It's B.

711
00:35:51,290 --> 00:35:53,630
Oh! Just as I thought.
I see.

712
00:35:53,830 --> 00:35:58,790
There was no string missing,
so I think it was more powerful.

713
00:35:58,960 --> 00:35:59,880
I see.

714
00:36:01,630 --> 00:36:05,920
Kazushige chose B, which is also
the majority at the studio.

715
00:36:07,960 --> 00:36:12,080
"Waiting room B"

716
00:36:12,170 --> 00:36:13,040
Okay.

717
00:36:14,750 --> 00:36:16,210
I don't like being the first one.

718
00:36:18,540 --> 00:36:21,670
Next, it's music lover
Mr Ryuta Sato.

719
00:36:21,750 --> 00:36:24,330
He skips lightly and appears.

720
00:36:24,420 --> 00:36:27,790
"Team Born in February,
Blood Type A, Ryuta Sato"

721
00:36:28,000 --> 00:36:30,460
Mr Sato looks confident.
He does.

722
00:36:32,670 --> 00:36:34,460
What is his answer?

723
00:36:34,750 --> 00:36:36,250
The correct answer is B.

724
00:36:36,380 --> 00:36:40,000
Wow! He's full of confidence!
Full of confidence.

725
00:36:40,170 --> 00:36:44,000
It's the depth and weight
of the sound,

726
00:36:44,040 --> 00:36:46,920
Performance B
was overwhelmingly better.

727
00:36:47,000 --> 00:36:49,290
It can't be wrong! It has to be B.

728
00:36:49,380 --> 00:36:53,250
Miss Karina, you also think it's B.
You two agree, right?

729
00:36:54,000 --> 00:36:54,880
I'll sanitise my hands.

730
00:36:54,960 --> 00:36:56,750
Without any hesitation

731
00:36:56,830 --> 00:37:00,290
he goes to Room B,
where Kazushige is waiting.

732
00:37:01,920 --> 00:37:03,670
Oh, it's this, right?

733
00:37:03,790 --> 00:37:05,670
That's what I think,
but I don't know.

734
00:37:05,830 --> 00:37:07,830
I felt its weight and depth.

735
00:37:07,920 --> 00:37:09,380
You felt the depth.
Yes.

736
00:37:09,920 --> 00:37:11,380
Thanks.

737
00:37:11,540 --> 00:37:12,710
Good. This is great.

738
00:37:13,710 --> 00:37:17,040
Next, it's Miss Fuka Koshiba,
who is so well prepared

739
00:37:17,130 --> 00:37:18,790
that she cleaned her ears.

740
00:37:18,880 --> 00:37:20,750
"Team Yokai Housemate, Fuka Koshiba"

741
00:37:20,830 --> 00:37:22,000
I feel sick...

742
00:37:23,210 --> 00:37:25,540
She said she felt sick.

743
00:37:25,630 --> 00:37:27,670
She's probably very nervous.

744
00:37:29,080 --> 00:37:31,920
Despite her nerves,
the answer she gives is...

745
00:37:33,880 --> 00:37:34,750
It's A.

746
00:37:37,580 --> 00:37:39,330
Oh?
Right?

747
00:37:41,710 --> 00:37:44,000
Is this right? I'm scared!

748
00:37:44,040 --> 00:37:45,080
She's scared.

749
00:37:45,170 --> 00:37:46,250
The reason is...

750
00:37:46,750 --> 00:37:50,960
I think the high notes
went up smoothly,

751
00:37:51,080 --> 00:37:52,880
I liked this one more.

752
00:37:53,210 --> 00:37:55,790
But... Okay, I'll choose this.

753
00:37:57,710 --> 00:37:59,460
Her answer is different from yours,
Miss Matsumoto.

754
00:37:59,540 --> 00:38:01,290
It is.

755
00:38:01,580 --> 00:38:06,750
They played the first one skilfully,

756
00:38:06,830 --> 00:38:10,540
I think it became narrower.
That's right.

757
00:38:11,500 --> 00:38:13,880
I hear them talking in Room B...

758
00:38:16,250 --> 00:38:17,670
I want to go back!

759
00:38:18,170 --> 00:38:20,500
She wants to go back.
Because she's alone.

760
00:38:20,580 --> 00:38:21,500
This is awful.

761
00:38:21,710 --> 00:38:23,460
I'm sorry, Miss Marika!

762
00:38:23,540 --> 00:38:25,500
"Waiting room A"

763
00:38:25,580 --> 00:38:28,790
Can I sit at the centre?
I knew this would happen...

764
00:38:30,080 --> 00:38:34,170
Fuka cleaned her ears
before coming here just now.

765
00:38:34,710 --> 00:38:36,630
It's impressive
she cleaned her ears.

766
00:38:39,460 --> 00:38:43,920
Is the correct answer A or B?

767
00:38:44,580 --> 00:38:48,290
Now, we'll tell you
the correct answer at the studio.

768
00:38:48,380 --> 00:38:49,790
Now?

769
00:38:49,880 --> 00:38:51,250
The correct answer is...

770
00:38:52,290 --> 00:38:53,460
What?

771
00:38:54,670 --> 00:38:55,580
No way!

772
00:38:55,710 --> 00:38:56,750
Are you serious?

773
00:38:57,380 --> 00:39:01,000
Now, we'll tell you
the correct answer at the studio.

774
00:39:01,040 --> 00:39:02,960
Now?

775
00:39:03,000 --> 00:39:05,880
We'll know where
the people after them will go in.

776
00:39:05,960 --> 00:39:06,960
I see.

777
00:39:07,040 --> 00:39:08,130
Let's do it!

778
00:39:08,290 --> 00:39:09,750
The correct answer is...

779
00:39:11,000 --> 00:39:11,880
A.

780
00:39:12,170 --> 00:39:13,710
Yes!
Right?

781
00:39:14,460 --> 00:39:15,920
Yes!
Right?

782
00:39:16,080 --> 00:39:18,000
What? No way!

783
00:39:18,130 --> 00:39:19,540
Yes!
Right?

784
00:39:19,670 --> 00:39:23,460
What? No way!
I'm sure about it.

785
00:39:23,540 --> 00:39:25,460
Impressive!
I'm sure it is!

786
00:39:25,710 --> 00:39:27,830
No way!
I'm sure it is.

787
00:39:27,960 --> 00:39:30,750
It has to be.
I'm so sad.

788
00:39:30,960 --> 00:39:32,960
The two guys at B are sure
they got it right.

789
00:39:33,000 --> 00:39:34,130
Yeah.

790
00:39:34,580 --> 00:39:35,960
Fuka, why don't you come here?

791
00:39:36,000 --> 00:39:39,170
I want to! I want to go there now!

792
00:39:41,000 --> 00:39:43,420
Did you know the answer?

793
00:39:43,500 --> 00:39:44,750
A is the correct answer,

794
00:39:44,830 --> 00:39:47,920
a quartet performance
with all the strings.

795
00:39:48,330 --> 00:39:50,420
She got it right,
but she keeps looking down!

796
00:39:50,670 --> 00:39:51,750
She looks sad.

797
00:39:54,250 --> 00:39:58,040
She's so worried that she sighed,
but she answered correctly.

798
00:39:59,000 --> 00:40:03,210
Kazushige, Chisako will definitely
beat you up with her bow.

799
00:40:03,630 --> 00:40:05,880
Please change your slippers.

800
00:40:05,960 --> 00:40:09,460
Miss Karina has also become
a common celebrity.

801
00:40:09,580 --> 00:40:10,790
I see, it keeps going down.

802
00:40:10,920 --> 00:40:13,580
You'll keep changing
if anyone chooses B.

803
00:40:14,210 --> 00:40:15,500
No! Kochi!

804
00:40:16,380 --> 00:40:20,580
Next, it's Mr Kochi
from Johnny's new star, SixTONES.

805
00:40:21,540 --> 00:40:24,330
Which one will Kochi answer?

806
00:40:24,460 --> 00:40:26,790
You said A.
I said A.

807
00:40:27,750 --> 00:40:29,920
Will he choose
the correct answer, A?

808
00:40:30,000 --> 00:40:31,750
His answer is...

809
00:40:32,830 --> 00:40:34,000
The correct answer is...

810
00:40:34,960 --> 00:40:35,920
Come...

811
00:40:36,080 --> 00:40:37,000
B.

812
00:40:37,040 --> 00:40:38,330
Why?

813
00:40:38,420 --> 00:40:40,460
Mr Jesse, please come to the front.

814
00:40:40,540 --> 00:40:42,290
You can't stay
as firstrated celebrity.

815
00:40:42,380 --> 00:40:43,580
He got you involved.

816
00:40:43,880 --> 00:40:48,790
The first one didn't have depth,
the musicians played it carefully.

817
00:40:48,880 --> 00:40:50,420
What are you talking about?

818
00:40:50,830 --> 00:40:54,130
It's enough! Stop commenting!

819
00:40:54,960 --> 00:40:56,920
On the contrary,
when I listened to B next,

820
00:40:57,130 --> 00:40:58,210
it had so much depth.

821
00:40:58,290 --> 00:41:00,380
I'm so embarrassed!

822
00:41:01,000 --> 00:41:02,330
I'm embarrassed.

823
00:41:03,210 --> 00:41:06,000
Jesse, it can't be helped,
this is what he thinks.

824
00:41:06,040 --> 00:41:09,080
Please use
the string instruments of B

825
00:41:09,170 --> 00:41:10,880
to play for SixTONES.

826
00:41:11,000 --> 00:41:14,330
I'd like them to be played
with our band.

827
00:41:15,130 --> 00:41:16,420
Shut up!

828
00:41:16,920 --> 00:41:18,170
A band with missing strings?

829
00:41:18,250 --> 00:41:20,460
Indeed!

830
00:41:21,000 --> 00:41:23,330
It seems SixTONES will have
a quartet performance

831
00:41:23,420 --> 00:41:25,250
with missing strings
in their concerts.

832
00:41:27,080 --> 00:41:28,130
Excuse me.

833
00:41:30,380 --> 00:41:32,750
Yes!
I'm a bit happy.

834
00:41:33,000 --> 00:41:35,000
Thank goodness.
Thank you!

835
00:41:35,080 --> 00:41:36,290
They look proud.

836
00:41:36,380 --> 00:41:38,250
They're sure they're right.

837
00:41:38,330 --> 00:41:41,330
Why are you fist bumping?

838
00:41:41,420 --> 00:41:44,380
This fist bump is so embarrassing.

839
00:41:45,500 --> 00:41:47,750
The fist bump is embarrassing.

840
00:41:48,040 --> 00:41:49,540
He's a pro of music.

841
00:41:49,630 --> 00:41:51,380
Yes, I've been listening to it.

842
00:41:51,460 --> 00:41:53,960
Kochi can't get it wrong.
That's right.

843
00:41:54,500 --> 00:41:55,670
Oh, I'm happy.

844
00:41:55,750 --> 00:41:56,960
Fuka, come and join us!

845
00:41:57,040 --> 00:41:58,250
I want to!

846
00:41:58,380 --> 00:42:00,130
It's only three guys here now.
Yes.

847
00:42:00,210 --> 00:42:03,920
We'd like a beautiful lady here.
Yes, we do.

848
00:42:05,250 --> 00:42:09,080
These three teams
will have the test next.

849
00:42:12,960 --> 00:42:14,500
He has a 33year career in showbiz,

850
00:42:14,580 --> 00:42:17,960
and is also a member
of the comedian duo Honjamaka.

851
00:42:18,000 --> 00:42:23,130
Mr Toshiaki Megumi hosts
a daytime information programme.

852
00:42:24,170 --> 00:42:27,000
I'm sorry,
but I'll get this right easily.

853
00:42:27,130 --> 00:42:29,830
I've been hosting the show
"MUSIC FAIR" for 18 years.

854
00:42:29,920 --> 00:42:30,830
That's right.

855
00:42:30,920 --> 00:42:32,000
I'll know right away.

856
00:42:32,080 --> 00:42:34,210
The difference in sound. I see.

857
00:42:34,750 --> 00:42:38,330
Former player in Japan's
National Team, Mr Yuji Nakazawa.

858
00:42:38,630 --> 00:42:41,750
He had played twice in the World Cup
when he was active,

859
00:42:41,830 --> 00:42:44,630
and was the key
of SAMURAI BLUE's defence.

860
00:42:44,960 --> 00:42:48,880
I can hear my teammates' voices
in the cheering of 60,000 people,

861
00:42:49,130 --> 00:42:50,880
and I know when supporters boo, too.

862
00:42:50,960 --> 00:42:52,630
I can hear booing,

863
00:42:52,710 --> 00:42:53,960
and I think the one
with missing strings

864
00:42:54,000 --> 00:42:54,880
will be like booing.

865
00:42:56,130 --> 00:42:58,080
That's the way you think?
That's right.

866
00:42:58,540 --> 00:43:00,420
From Nogizaka46,

867
00:43:00,500 --> 00:43:04,880
Miss Yuki Yoda, Miss Asuka Saito,
and Mizuki Yamashita.

868
00:43:05,170 --> 00:43:07,080
Last year was the 10th anniversary
of their debut,

869
00:43:07,170 --> 00:43:10,380
the national idols
are extremely popular.

870
00:43:10,790 --> 00:43:14,000
We sing to live music
performance too,

871
00:43:14,080 --> 00:43:16,710
Mr Akimoto will be angry
if we get this wrong.

872
00:43:17,250 --> 00:43:19,080
I think we can do this.

873
00:43:19,540 --> 00:43:22,170
First, the correct answer, A.

874
00:43:22,250 --> 00:43:26,460
"A: Best quality that costs
a total of 250 million yen"

875
00:43:26,880 --> 00:43:30,790
"Violinist: Kyoka Misawa"

876
00:43:31,250 --> 00:43:34,750
"Violinist: Rintaro Kikuno"

877
00:43:34,830 --> 00:43:40,000
String instruments need four strings
to play elegant music.

878
00:43:40,380 --> 00:43:43,330
Two or three strings will limit
the sound they can make,

879
00:43:43,580 --> 00:43:46,130
even the same piece
will sound totally different.

880
00:44:23,380 --> 00:44:24,920
Next, the wrong answer,

881
00:44:25,040 --> 00:44:27,000
rubbish string instruments
with missing strings.

882
00:44:27,040 --> 00:44:29,750
Watch carefully
how the musicians play it.

883
00:44:29,830 --> 00:44:33,500
"B: Cheap string instruments for
beginners with missing strings"

884
00:44:42,000 --> 00:44:46,580
In fact, the most important violin
that plays the melody

885
00:44:46,670 --> 00:44:48,040
has two strings missing.

886
00:45:31,080 --> 00:45:33,500
I hope someone, even just one person
will come.

887
00:45:36,210 --> 00:45:39,080
It feels so awkward to be alone.

888
00:45:41,380 --> 00:45:45,750
Will the remaining three teams
choose the correct answer, A?

889
00:45:46,830 --> 00:45:51,960
First, daytime show host Mr Megumi,
who wants to stay firstrated.

890
00:45:52,000 --> 00:45:53,750
"Team Kagoshima, Toshiaki Megumi"

891
00:45:53,830 --> 00:45:56,750
Okay! Wait, he's here.
I'm counting on you.

892
00:45:57,080 --> 00:45:58,210
Guess it right.

893
00:45:59,250 --> 00:46:01,580
His answer is...

894
00:46:04,670 --> 00:46:08,250
Ah! He messed up!

895
00:46:08,580 --> 00:46:11,920
No! This...

896
00:46:12,580 --> 00:46:15,710
No!
I see...

897
00:46:16,880 --> 00:46:20,500
When I thought about
how to tell them apart,

898
00:46:20,880 --> 00:46:23,790
it was how the low notes unfolded.

899
00:46:23,960 --> 00:46:24,880
Low notes.

900
00:46:25,460 --> 00:46:27,170
So embarrassing!
It's embarrassing.

901
00:46:27,250 --> 00:46:29,290
It's embarrassing
to say it in that tone.

902
00:46:30,540 --> 00:46:34,500
I clearly felt the low notes of B
unfolded better.

903
00:46:34,630 --> 00:46:36,790
Well, Mr Show also said it was B.

904
00:46:36,880 --> 00:46:39,290
Well, I also said it was B.
It can't be helped.

905
00:46:40,540 --> 00:46:44,000
People keep gathering
at the super embarrassing Room B.

906
00:46:44,330 --> 00:46:45,710
Yes, Mr Megumi!

907
00:46:45,790 --> 00:46:46,830
Yes!

908
00:46:46,920 --> 00:46:48,500
Welcome!
Welcome!

909
00:46:48,580 --> 00:46:49,420
Hello.

910
00:46:49,500 --> 00:46:51,000
Thank goodness!
It's B, right?

911
00:46:51,080 --> 00:46:53,330
We have a great lineup, don't we?

912
00:46:53,540 --> 00:46:56,000
Yes...
Thank you.

913
00:46:56,040 --> 00:46:57,000
Welcome.

914
00:46:57,080 --> 00:46:59,380
They're so sure they've won.

915
00:46:59,920 --> 00:47:01,710
They are so confident.

916
00:47:01,790 --> 00:47:03,170
"B: wrong"

917
00:47:03,790 --> 00:47:06,630
On the other hand, she got it right,

918
00:47:06,710 --> 00:47:08,460
but looks worried
because she's alone.

919
00:47:08,540 --> 00:47:09,830
"Worried but correct"

920
00:47:10,580 --> 00:47:13,170
Next, they don't want
to go down again.

921
00:47:13,290 --> 00:47:16,080
It's common celebrity, Team Soccer.

922
00:47:16,460 --> 00:47:17,420
Okay...

923
00:47:17,500 --> 00:47:21,000
Okay, Mr Nakazawa is here.

924
00:47:21,080 --> 00:47:22,000
Now...

925
00:47:22,080 --> 00:47:23,500
It's funny enough to watch.

926
00:47:24,080 --> 00:47:27,630
I think there's a clear difference.

927
00:47:27,710 --> 00:47:29,170
Don't go there.

928
00:47:29,250 --> 00:47:32,420
It's about which one is that.

929
00:47:33,380 --> 00:47:35,500
What does he mean?

930
00:47:35,580 --> 00:47:38,080
He's saying something pointless.

931
00:47:38,630 --> 00:47:41,580
Is Nakazawa okay? His answer is...

932
00:47:41,670 --> 00:47:42,920
The correct answer, right?

933
00:47:43,420 --> 00:47:45,500
The correct answer is A.

934
00:47:45,920 --> 00:47:48,830
Wow!
Wow!

935
00:47:49,000 --> 00:47:51,210
Amazing!
Yay!

936
00:47:51,330 --> 00:47:52,630
He made it.

937
00:47:52,750 --> 00:47:54,630
Amazing!
His hearing is good.

938
00:47:54,710 --> 00:47:56,040
First, B...

939
00:47:56,880 --> 00:48:01,210
Among the 60,000 supporters,

940
00:48:01,330 --> 00:48:07,040
it was saying, "Stupid Nakazawa,
dumb Nakazawa!"

941
00:48:07,210 --> 00:48:13,420
It sounded something like booing.

942
00:48:13,630 --> 00:48:18,750
But A sounded like, "Nakazawa,
you're amazing, you're cool!"

943
00:48:18,830 --> 00:48:22,130
It was easy on the ears.

944
00:48:22,210 --> 00:48:24,330
Well, his answer is correct.
It is.

945
00:48:24,460 --> 00:48:26,250
Say whatever you want!

946
00:48:26,380 --> 00:48:28,000
Wow!
Impressive.

947
00:48:28,170 --> 00:48:32,290
I wonder what she's going to think.

948
00:48:32,670 --> 00:48:34,630
"Whoa! A dark guy came in!"

949
00:48:36,000 --> 00:48:37,710
"I can't trust him!"

950
00:48:38,290 --> 00:48:40,170
The dark guy has arrived.

951
00:48:41,880 --> 00:48:43,880
Oh, someone came!

952
00:48:43,960 --> 00:48:45,420
"A: correct"

953
00:48:48,000 --> 00:48:48,920
Don't worry.

954
00:48:49,920 --> 00:48:50,750
What?

955
00:48:50,830 --> 00:48:52,830
Nakazawa went to the other room.

956
00:48:52,920 --> 00:48:54,420
It makes her feel relieved.

957
00:48:54,670 --> 00:48:55,920
Don't worry.
Really?

958
00:48:56,000 --> 00:48:58,880
She feels relieved
when Mr Nakazawa goes there.

959
00:48:59,080 --> 00:49:01,080
They are so arrogant!

960
00:49:02,460 --> 00:49:05,630
Can they be more marked for death?

961
00:49:05,830 --> 00:49:08,040
They're totally marked for death.

962
00:49:08,250 --> 00:49:10,330
Nogizaka46 will decide whether

963
00:49:10,750 --> 00:49:13,670
we'll lose all firstrated celebs
in test two.

964
00:49:13,750 --> 00:49:15,920
Really? I want to hold on to this.

965
00:49:16,000 --> 00:49:17,080
I want to remain firstrated.

966
00:49:17,630 --> 00:49:20,210
The last team
is Team Idols And Comedians.

967
00:49:20,290 --> 00:49:23,750
Can they hold firmly on to the seat
of firstrated celebrities?

968
00:49:24,630 --> 00:49:25,880
It's now!

969
00:49:25,960 --> 00:49:29,170
Please!
We're counting on you!

970
00:49:29,290 --> 00:49:30,790
Don't all choose B.

971
00:49:31,080 --> 00:49:33,830
Okay, raise the correct answer, A.

972
00:49:33,960 --> 00:49:34,920
Let's do it.

973
00:49:35,000 --> 00:49:36,040
Ready, go.

974
00:49:45,540 --> 00:49:47,880
Hey! This is awful!

975
00:49:48,040 --> 00:49:49,580
This can't be helped.

976
00:49:49,750 --> 00:49:51,080
They all chose B.

977
00:49:51,170 --> 00:49:53,380
Hey!
I hate this!

978
00:49:53,460 --> 00:49:54,380
It can't be helped.

979
00:49:54,460 --> 00:49:57,130
No!
Apologise to Mr Akimoto!

980
00:49:58,000 --> 00:50:00,540
They used string instruments
with missing strings in A,

981
00:50:00,750 --> 00:50:03,630
then used decent ones after that,

982
00:50:03,750 --> 00:50:06,130
so they were fired up.
That's why!

983
00:50:06,210 --> 00:50:07,040
Yeah.

984
00:50:07,130 --> 00:50:08,710
Don't agree!
It's enough!

985
00:50:09,040 --> 00:50:10,710
Thank goodness we agreed.

986
00:50:10,790 --> 00:50:13,420
It's better
if your opinions were divided!

987
00:50:13,500 --> 00:50:15,920
Be divided!
Please! Don't look so sure!

988
00:50:16,000 --> 00:50:18,380
We wished you would be divided!

989
00:50:18,750 --> 00:50:20,830
They chose
the rubbish string instruments

990
00:50:20,920 --> 00:50:22,250
without fighting,

991
00:50:22,380 --> 00:50:26,380
and enter Room B,
where embarrassing guys gather.

992
00:50:27,080 --> 00:50:28,330
Ready, go.

993
00:50:29,130 --> 00:50:30,500
Oh, here you are!

994
00:50:30,630 --> 00:50:32,460
Yay!
Yes!

995
00:50:32,540 --> 00:50:34,580
Welcome!

996
00:50:35,920 --> 00:50:37,040
So embarrassing!

997
00:50:37,130 --> 00:50:39,290
No...
Don't show him on screen!

998
00:50:39,750 --> 00:50:40,920
Welcome!

999
00:50:41,000 --> 00:50:42,420
Welcome!

1000
00:50:42,500 --> 00:50:45,040
I'm so happy!
It's four guys here.

1001
00:50:45,210 --> 00:50:47,210
Mr Megumi spreads his arm
to welcome them.

1002
00:50:47,330 --> 00:50:49,290
Welcome!
He's showing them the way.

1003
00:50:49,420 --> 00:50:51,250
Whoa...
Don't worry. It's okay.

1004
00:50:51,330 --> 00:50:52,670
Really?

1005
00:50:53,790 --> 00:50:56,830
The fateful announcement
of the result!

1006
00:50:57,380 --> 00:50:59,670
Here I am!

1007
00:50:59,750 --> 00:51:00,580
Please...

1008
00:51:00,670 --> 00:51:03,500
Celeb Master will go to the room
of the correct answer.

1009
00:51:04,250 --> 00:51:07,830
I'll open the door
of the correct answer's room.

1010
00:51:09,460 --> 00:51:11,460
Mr Hamada, come here!

1011
00:51:11,830 --> 00:51:12,790
Don't worry.

1012
00:51:12,960 --> 00:51:16,540
"B: wrong"

1013
00:51:17,170 --> 00:51:18,540
The correct answer is...

1014
00:51:19,790 --> 00:51:22,460
"A: correct"

1015
00:51:22,540 --> 00:51:24,540
"Useless prayer"

1016
00:51:24,630 --> 00:51:25,500
What?

1017
00:51:29,000 --> 00:51:31,540
Yay!
Congratulations!

1018
00:51:32,460 --> 00:51:33,670
Yay!

1019
00:51:34,170 --> 00:51:35,580
My mic fell.

1020
00:51:35,880 --> 00:51:37,500
"A: correct"

1021
00:51:37,580 --> 00:51:39,880
Yay!
Congratulations!

1022
00:51:40,460 --> 00:51:42,670
My mic fell...

1023
00:51:43,500 --> 00:51:46,630
Yay...
What?

1024
00:51:46,750 --> 00:51:49,670
Are you kidding me?
Are you kidding me?

1025
00:51:50,130 --> 00:51:51,460
Are you kidding me?

1026
00:51:55,250 --> 00:51:57,460
His face! Mr Megumi!
Mr Megumi!

1027
00:51:57,580 --> 00:51:59,960
Fuka is crying.

1028
00:52:00,330 --> 00:52:01,670
Yay!

1029
00:52:05,290 --> 00:52:07,000
What did you think when he came in?

1030
00:52:07,040 --> 00:52:09,000
I felt really relieved,

1031
00:52:09,130 --> 00:52:11,500
because I was alone the whole time.

1032
00:52:12,580 --> 00:52:14,080
Oh, thank goodness!

1033
00:52:15,040 --> 00:52:16,460
Oh, your hearing actually is good.

1034
00:52:16,540 --> 00:52:18,630
Thank you.
Brilliant.

1035
00:52:18,750 --> 00:52:20,330
Are you kidding me?

1036
00:52:20,420 --> 00:52:22,920
This is bad!
Oh no...

1037
00:52:25,000 --> 00:52:28,920
People who answered wrong
are back. Come in.

1038
00:52:29,080 --> 00:52:30,500
There are many.

1039
00:52:30,630 --> 00:52:31,580
What?

1040
00:52:31,830 --> 00:52:34,250
"Wrong answer entrance"

1041
00:52:34,330 --> 00:52:36,500
We don't usually see
Mr Megumi like that.

1042
00:52:36,580 --> 00:52:38,460
Welcome back.

1043
00:52:38,960 --> 00:52:39,920
I messed up.

1044
00:52:40,040 --> 00:52:42,330
You guys sat there so arrogantly.

1045
00:52:42,630 --> 00:52:44,000
Mr Kazushige is bowing.

1046
00:52:44,080 --> 00:52:46,670
Okay... Come in, come in.

1047
00:52:46,790 --> 00:52:48,000
That's right.

1048
00:52:48,750 --> 00:52:50,330
Come and sit down.

1049
00:52:50,420 --> 00:52:51,960
There are too many of you!

1050
00:52:52,000 --> 00:52:53,080
There are many!

1051
00:52:53,170 --> 00:52:55,290
So many!
There are so many!

1052
00:52:56,330 --> 00:52:58,000
Come, Yuki, hurry up.

1053
00:52:58,210 --> 00:53:00,830
Okay, let's check now.

1054
00:53:01,170 --> 00:53:04,290
We have no firstrated celebrity!

1055
00:53:04,380 --> 00:53:06,000
There is none!

1056
00:53:06,920 --> 00:53:07,790
It was only test two.

1057
00:53:07,880 --> 00:53:11,920
Only this team
is secondrated celebrities.

1058
00:53:12,460 --> 00:53:13,630
What's this?

1059
00:53:13,710 --> 00:53:16,460
We have no firstrated celebrity
after test two.

1060
00:53:16,540 --> 00:53:19,830
This really is a spring storm.
What will happen at the end?

1061
00:53:22,690 --> 00:53:28,030
"Who Is The Real Celebrity BASIC,
threehour programme in spring!"

1062
00:53:28,480 --> 00:53:30,230
The spring grading consists

1063
00:53:30,320 --> 00:53:34,570
of super basic tests that
they should obviously guess right.

1064
00:53:35,860 --> 00:53:39,860
The Spring Grading consists of tests
on basic knowledge they should know.

1065
00:53:39,940 --> 00:53:41,530
The correct answer is...

1066
00:53:42,400 --> 00:53:44,730
For example,
in the string quartet performance,

1067
00:53:45,480 --> 00:53:48,980
they'll compare the most expensive
musical instrument

1068
00:53:49,070 --> 00:53:50,280
to one that lacks a string.

1069
00:53:51,070 --> 00:53:53,820
The tasting test
is also a basic test

1070
00:53:54,440 --> 00:53:57,440
on comparing the finest quality
squid to Kanetsu Delica Foods'

1071
00:53:57,530 --> 00:54:02,650
unreleased product, Hobohobo Ika,
which is made with fish paste.

1072
00:54:03,570 --> 00:54:04,730
Are you kidding me?

1073
00:54:06,230 --> 00:54:10,440
Of course, if they get it wrong,
their rank will go down

1074
00:54:10,570 --> 00:54:14,690
and vanish from the screen
at the end, so be careful!

1075
00:54:14,860 --> 00:54:16,320
The third test is...

1076
00:54:16,400 --> 00:54:17,610
"Hamburger steak"

1077
00:54:17,690 --> 00:54:19,650
Hamburger steak.

1078
00:54:20,900 --> 00:54:25,940
You're going to taste and compare
hamburger steaks A and B.

1079
00:54:26,030 --> 00:54:31,190
The correct answer is a very common
hamburger steak made with

1080
00:54:31,280 --> 00:54:32,780
minced meat bought at a supermarket.

1081
00:54:32,860 --> 00:54:35,860
It's very common,
so you must've tried it.

1082
00:54:35,980 --> 00:54:41,400
The wrong hamburger steak
also used beef,

1083
00:54:41,940 --> 00:54:45,980
but the other kind of minced meat
is different. It's this...

1084
00:54:46,110 --> 00:54:48,610
It's minced pig or deer testicles.

1085
00:54:48,690 --> 00:54:50,360
What?
What did you say?

1086
00:54:50,400 --> 00:54:53,030
It's pig or deer testicles.

1087
00:54:53,110 --> 00:54:55,070
Can you tell?
Deer?

1088
00:54:55,150 --> 00:54:56,190
To sum up,

1089
00:54:56,360 --> 00:55:00,570
choose the hamburger steak
made with minced beef and pork.

1090
00:55:00,820 --> 00:55:04,900
Will you explain it
in a bit more detail?

1091
00:55:04,980 --> 00:55:06,280
What's that? More detailed

1092
00:55:06,400 --> 00:55:07,400
Testicles.

1093
00:55:11,570 --> 00:55:13,690
These are the representatives.

1094
00:55:13,780 --> 00:55:18,860
Just choose the hamburger steak
you usually eat.

1095
00:55:19,070 --> 00:55:20,980
Representatives, please!

1096
00:55:21,110 --> 00:55:22,400
Thank you.

1097
00:55:22,480 --> 00:55:24,780
Let's go!

1098
00:55:25,440 --> 00:55:26,570
Please go to the room.

1099
00:55:26,650 --> 00:55:30,360
Just choose the hamburger steak
you usually eat.

1100
00:55:30,400 --> 00:55:31,860
Okay, let's go and eat.

1101
00:55:31,940 --> 00:55:34,190
That's right, your usual one.

1102
00:55:34,980 --> 00:55:36,230
The first one is...

1103
00:55:39,360 --> 00:55:40,610
Thank you.

1104
00:55:41,980 --> 00:55:45,070
He wants to make up for his mistake
in the quartet performance,

1105
00:55:45,230 --> 00:55:47,650
common celebrity, Mr Ryuta Sato.

1106
00:55:47,730 --> 00:55:48,860
"Ryuta Sato"

1107
00:55:48,940 --> 00:55:51,360
Hamburger steak is my favourite!
Right?

1108
00:55:51,400 --> 00:55:53,690
I'll guess it right at once.
You'll know.

1109
00:55:53,780 --> 00:55:55,400
I'll be back triumphantly!

1110
00:55:57,280 --> 00:56:01,860
The first four groups' wrong answer
will have pig testicles added.

1111
00:56:01,940 --> 00:56:03,150
Hang on...

1112
00:56:03,320 --> 00:56:05,360
It doesn't feel wrong at all.

1113
00:56:07,070 --> 00:56:09,360
First, hamburger steak A.

1114
00:56:09,400 --> 00:56:11,190
"Hamburger steak A"

1115
00:56:11,280 --> 00:56:12,690
First, it's A.

1116
00:56:17,070 --> 00:56:19,070
He loves hamburger steak.
Yes.

1117
00:56:21,400 --> 00:56:23,400
Next, B.

1118
00:56:24,360 --> 00:56:26,730
Please open your mouth.

1119
00:56:26,860 --> 00:56:27,980
Open your mouth!

1120
00:56:32,400 --> 00:56:35,480
One of them has testicles added.

1121
00:56:35,570 --> 00:56:37,150
"Hamburger steak B"

1122
00:56:46,110 --> 00:56:48,110
Ah...

1123
00:56:48,900 --> 00:56:51,280
What reaction is this?

1124
00:56:52,230 --> 00:56:54,530
I'll guess the common one?

1125
00:56:54,730 --> 00:56:55,570
Of course.

1126
00:56:55,650 --> 00:56:57,570
The one with no testicle?

1127
00:56:57,690 --> 00:56:58,900
That's right!

1128
00:57:01,030 --> 00:57:02,940
Which one has no testicle?

1129
00:57:03,820 --> 00:57:05,360
This is the correct answer.

1130
00:57:05,400 --> 00:57:07,360
"Hamburger steak B"

1131
00:57:07,400 --> 00:57:13,360
It's simply because A has a taste
I've never tried before.

1132
00:57:14,230 --> 00:57:17,570
So, first, Mr Sato chose B.

1133
00:57:18,730 --> 00:57:22,150
Nobody is in either room, right?
Okay...

1134
00:57:22,780 --> 00:57:25,900
One has added testicles,
"addicle" for short.

1135
00:57:25,980 --> 00:57:28,440
It's harder to choose the wrong one.

1136
00:57:29,690 --> 00:57:30,980
The next one is...

1137
00:57:34,730 --> 00:57:38,320
Common celebrity,
actress Marika Matsumoto appears

1138
00:57:38,400 --> 00:57:40,070
with an enchanting smile.

1139
00:57:40,150 --> 00:57:41,650
"Marika Matsumoto"

1140
00:57:41,820 --> 00:57:43,150
How will you do, Miss Matsumoto?

1141
00:57:43,400 --> 00:57:46,150
I'd like to show you my status!

1142
00:57:46,230 --> 00:57:48,400
The way you talk is good. It's good.

1143
00:57:54,730 --> 00:57:56,570
She's curious about the side.

1144
00:57:56,690 --> 00:57:58,110
Her right side...

1145
00:58:00,980 --> 00:58:02,860
First, hamburger steak A.

1146
00:58:03,150 --> 00:58:05,480
"Hamburger steak A"

1147
00:58:09,480 --> 00:58:10,570
She reacted quickly.

1148
00:58:11,440 --> 00:58:14,980
An actress shouldn't choose
the testicles.

1149
00:58:19,320 --> 00:58:21,780
Next, hamburger steak B,
which Ryuta Sato chose.

1150
00:58:21,860 --> 00:58:25,360
Is this testicles or not?

1151
00:58:25,480 --> 00:58:27,440
Which one will she choose?

1152
00:58:28,400 --> 00:58:32,070
"Hamburger steak B"

1153
00:58:32,320 --> 00:58:36,400
She keeps nodding.
Yes, and Mr Sato too.

1154
00:58:37,070 --> 00:58:38,480
Come here! Come here!

1155
00:58:39,940 --> 00:58:41,570
Her answer is...

1156
00:58:42,360 --> 00:58:43,190
Okay.

1157
00:58:43,860 --> 00:58:44,730
"Hamburger steak A"

1158
00:58:44,820 --> 00:58:46,070
Oh, they're different!

1159
00:58:46,150 --> 00:58:47,780
They're different already.

1160
00:58:48,400 --> 00:58:49,230
Whoa!

1161
00:58:52,030 --> 00:58:56,150
A is a really plain,
common hamburger steak.

1162
00:58:56,860 --> 00:58:58,940
B tastes like it,

1163
00:58:59,030 --> 00:59:02,650
but the taste is somehow different.

1164
00:59:02,730 --> 00:59:03,690
I see.

1165
00:59:04,190 --> 00:59:06,570
I am sure it's A.

1166
00:59:07,400 --> 00:59:09,190
Their opinions are divided.

1167
00:59:09,650 --> 00:59:10,480
Wow...

1168
00:59:11,440 --> 00:59:13,360
Oh my god, this is bad!

1169
00:59:13,440 --> 00:59:17,230
The answers of hamburger steak with
testicles are already different.

1170
00:59:18,730 --> 00:59:19,820
It'll be okay.

1171
00:59:23,360 --> 00:59:24,280
Oh?

1172
00:59:24,690 --> 00:59:27,480
Why? Am I wrong?

1173
00:59:28,030 --> 00:59:29,360
Did I get it wrong?

1174
00:59:29,400 --> 00:59:30,780
We chose different ones.

1175
00:59:30,940 --> 00:59:32,400
What? Really?

1176
00:59:32,530 --> 00:59:34,280
You seem sure it's A.

1177
00:59:34,360 --> 00:59:36,610
I am sure it's A.

1178
00:59:36,820 --> 00:59:40,900
I thought the taste of A was unique.

1179
00:59:40,980 --> 00:59:43,150
Really?
Yeah.

1180
00:59:44,400 --> 00:59:49,070
Is the one who chose hamburger steak
with testicles Marika Matsumoto

1181
00:59:49,190 --> 00:59:50,730
or Ryuta Sato?

1182
00:59:50,820 --> 00:59:52,030
"Is A or B correct?"

1183
00:59:52,110 --> 00:59:55,650
Okay, I'll tell everyone
in the studio the correct answer.

1184
00:59:55,730 --> 00:59:57,780
What? Already?
Already?

1185
00:59:57,860 --> 01:00:00,030
We'll just see where
your teams go inside.

1186
01:00:00,110 --> 01:00:00,980
It has to be funny.

1187
01:00:01,190 --> 01:00:02,980
It's going to be funny after this.

1188
01:00:03,070 --> 01:00:04,820
Okay, the correct answer is...

1189
01:00:04,940 --> 01:00:06,320
Which one?
A!

1190
01:00:06,400 --> 01:00:07,730
"Correct: A"

1191
01:00:07,940 --> 01:00:08,900
He's wrong.

1192
01:00:09,030 --> 01:00:11,570
Miss Matsumoto is right?
I see.

1193
01:00:11,690 --> 01:00:16,190
Miss Karina, your chairs will be
changed, please come forward.

1194
01:00:16,480 --> 01:00:17,980
How cruel!

1195
01:00:18,110 --> 01:00:19,480
It's cruel.

1196
01:00:20,360 --> 01:00:23,480
Somehow B had a weird taste.

1197
01:00:23,610 --> 01:00:24,650
Really?

1198
01:00:25,110 --> 01:00:27,570
Marika Matsumoto chose
the correct answer.

1199
01:00:27,650 --> 01:00:29,400
Yes! Cobblers!

1200
01:00:29,820 --> 01:00:32,280
Did they do a good job
and deceived me?

1201
01:00:32,360 --> 01:00:34,690
"B: wrong"

1202
01:00:34,780 --> 01:00:38,320
Golden spheres are accumulating!

1203
01:00:39,400 --> 01:00:42,030
What will be this person's fate?

1204
01:00:43,400 --> 01:00:45,150
Here he is!

1205
01:00:45,610 --> 01:00:46,730
It's A!

1206
01:00:49,730 --> 01:00:54,570
There's no way a member of the grand
Koizumi Family chooses testicles!

1207
01:00:55,400 --> 01:00:59,860
I overthought it a bit
in the first test on wine.

1208
01:01:00,030 --> 01:01:02,070
Do you have any advice?

1209
01:01:02,360 --> 01:01:03,480
"Secondrated celebrity"

1210
01:01:03,570 --> 01:01:06,190
Please do give me your advice.

1211
01:01:06,280 --> 01:01:07,320
Say something now!

1212
01:01:08,480 --> 01:01:10,110
We're asking if you have
any advice or not.

1213
01:01:10,230 --> 01:01:11,980
Hamachan...
Yes?

1214
01:01:12,070 --> 01:01:12,900
No.

1215
01:01:15,860 --> 01:01:18,980
First, it's the correct answer,
the common hamburger steak.

1216
01:01:19,070 --> 01:01:20,400
"A: Minced beef and pork"

1217
01:01:20,440 --> 01:01:24,820
It's this one. Kotaro,
this is the real hamburger steak.

1218
01:01:27,320 --> 01:01:28,980
Oh? It doesn't feel right?

1219
01:01:29,110 --> 01:01:31,320
He's tilting his head.
He looks confused.

1220
01:01:34,190 --> 01:01:37,610
Next, if you choose
this testicle hamburger steak,

1221
01:01:37,690 --> 01:01:39,400
the former Prime Minister
will scold you.

1222
01:01:39,480 --> 01:01:42,320
"B: Minced beef and pig testicles"

1223
01:01:42,400 --> 01:01:43,820
Delicious!

1224
01:01:47,190 --> 01:01:48,690
See? I knew it.

1225
01:01:49,650 --> 01:01:51,190
It's made like that.

1226
01:01:54,570 --> 01:01:57,820
He can't afford to fail three times.
What is his answer?

1227
01:01:59,030 --> 01:02:02,570
The common one made with
beef and pork from the supermarket.

1228
01:02:02,900 --> 01:02:03,820
Which one?

1229
01:02:06,440 --> 01:02:08,440
"B: Minced beef and pig testicles"

1230
01:02:08,530 --> 01:02:10,530
See? I knew he'd choose that.

1231
01:02:11,280 --> 01:02:12,480
I knew it!

1232
01:02:16,070 --> 01:02:18,110
I couldn't help saying delicious.

1233
01:02:18,190 --> 01:02:21,150
It was as delicious as
the hamburger steaks I've tried.

1234
01:02:21,280 --> 01:02:22,280
You see?

1235
01:02:22,570 --> 01:02:24,440
See? I knew this would happen.

1236
01:02:25,440 --> 01:02:27,530
The taste of this one is lighter,

1237
01:02:28,110 --> 01:02:29,400
so I think it's B.

1238
01:02:29,940 --> 01:02:32,030
Oh? Testicles taste light?

1239
01:02:33,480 --> 01:02:36,940
Okay, Mr Kazushige,
you'll change into sandals.

1240
01:02:37,070 --> 01:02:39,530
They're sandals for the loo?
That's right.

1241
01:02:39,610 --> 01:02:40,820
That's right.

1242
01:02:42,400 --> 01:02:44,360
You say it like "the weird guy."

1243
01:02:44,730 --> 01:02:46,690
"Yes, that's right."

1244
01:02:46,860 --> 01:02:49,690
"That's right, I'm the weird guy."

1245
01:02:50,820 --> 01:02:52,730
It makes me nervous.

1246
01:02:53,400 --> 01:02:56,110
Everyone does this every time.

1247
01:02:57,110 --> 01:02:58,400
I'm impressed.

1248
01:02:59,820 --> 01:03:04,230
Kotaro, aka "Cobblertaro" Koizumi
shows up pleasantly.

1249
01:03:04,650 --> 01:03:07,400
I'm more confident in this
than the wine.

1250
01:03:07,570 --> 01:03:08,690
I knew right away.

1251
01:03:08,780 --> 01:03:10,860
"Cobblertaro Koizumi"

1252
01:03:11,940 --> 01:03:13,940
Thank goodness!
Thank goodness!

1253
01:03:14,030 --> 01:03:15,400
Welcome.
This is okay, right?

1254
01:03:15,480 --> 01:03:16,980
It's what I think.

1255
01:03:17,070 --> 01:03:19,110
But we've already had
different answers,

1256
01:03:19,230 --> 01:03:21,650
so I was very worried
before you came.

1257
01:03:24,280 --> 01:03:26,280
Oh no.
It's this situation.

1258
01:03:26,570 --> 01:03:28,230
Kotaro is laughing.

1259
01:03:30,070 --> 01:03:30,940
Whatever.

1260
01:03:31,690 --> 01:03:36,360
I hope Daddy Junichiro
isn't watching this.

1261
01:03:38,230 --> 01:03:39,360
The next one is...

1262
01:03:43,980 --> 01:03:45,400
Kochi is here!
Kochi!

1263
01:03:49,190 --> 01:03:53,730
SixTONES's Mr Kochi will surely lose
fans if he chooses the testicles.

1264
01:03:53,820 --> 01:03:54,940
"Yugo Kochi"

1265
01:03:55,030 --> 01:03:56,070
Mr Kochi, what do you think?

1266
01:03:56,150 --> 01:03:58,690
I make hamburger steaks myself,

1267
01:03:58,780 --> 01:04:01,230
so I only need to choose the one
that tastes like my usual ones.

1268
01:04:01,360 --> 01:04:03,070
That's right.
I'm confident.

1269
01:04:03,150 --> 01:04:04,400
That's right.

1270
01:04:04,860 --> 01:04:08,150
First, the correct answer,
the common hamburger steak.

1271
01:04:08,230 --> 01:04:15,070
"A: correct. Minced beef and pork"

1272
01:04:19,440 --> 01:04:21,110
He'll fail twice in a row
if he gets this wrong.

1273
01:04:21,190 --> 01:04:22,110
That's right.

1274
01:04:22,440 --> 01:04:24,530
Jesse, you answered yours right.
Yes.

1275
01:04:25,320 --> 01:04:29,190
Next, the wrong answer,
hamburger steak with pig testicles.

1276
01:04:29,280 --> 01:04:33,730
"B: wrong.
Minced beef and pig testicles"

1277
01:04:34,110 --> 01:04:36,070
Please choose B.

1278
01:04:36,530 --> 01:04:37,400
Come!

1279
01:04:38,320 --> 01:04:39,730
Which one will he choose?

1280
01:04:39,900 --> 01:04:41,780
Let's not be Testicles Johnny's.

1281
01:04:41,860 --> 01:04:43,400
"Let's not be Testicles Johnny's"

1282
01:04:43,940 --> 01:04:47,400
The moment he raises B,
he becomes a Testicles Johnny's!

1283
01:04:47,440 --> 01:04:49,110
What is his answer?

1284
01:04:49,400 --> 01:04:51,030
The hamburger steak I know is...

1285
01:04:51,940 --> 01:04:53,320
This one.
Yes!

1286
01:04:53,820 --> 01:04:55,190
Yes!
Impressive!

1287
01:04:55,400 --> 01:04:56,440
Well done!

1288
01:04:56,530 --> 01:04:57,690
Amazing!

1289
01:04:58,360 --> 01:05:01,230
The texture is like what I make,

1290
01:05:01,320 --> 01:05:03,610
this one is more chewy.

1291
01:05:03,860 --> 01:05:05,110
So I choose A.

1292
01:05:05,320 --> 01:05:06,400
Good!

1293
01:05:07,940 --> 01:05:08,900
Thank goodness.

1294
01:05:08,980 --> 01:05:10,860
"A: correct"

1295
01:05:11,230 --> 01:05:15,900
The taste of B was more familiar.

1296
01:05:15,980 --> 01:05:17,320
"B: wrong"

1297
01:05:17,400 --> 01:05:19,690
The flavour of A was stronger.

1298
01:05:20,780 --> 01:05:23,900
This is something
you shouldn't get wrong.

1299
01:05:29,320 --> 01:05:30,980
Thank goodness.
Wow...

1300
01:05:31,230 --> 01:05:33,610
This one, right?
This one, right?

1301
01:05:33,780 --> 01:05:35,230
Is it? Is it really?

1302
01:05:35,320 --> 01:05:36,280
Well...

1303
01:05:36,440 --> 01:05:39,650
Starting from this team,
they'll taste deer testicles.

1304
01:05:39,820 --> 01:05:42,610
That's right.
Will the taste change?

1305
01:05:43,360 --> 01:05:45,440
The first one
to try deer testicles is...

1306
01:05:46,400 --> 01:05:48,570
Here he is! Please do it, Big Bro!

1307
01:05:49,400 --> 01:05:51,320
It's Mr Show.
Yes.

1308
01:05:51,480 --> 01:05:53,570
I think he's good at this.

1309
01:05:54,900 --> 01:05:59,230
Big Bro, make sure you don't choose
the deer testicles!

1310
01:05:59,320 --> 01:06:00,610
"Show Aikawa"

1311
01:06:00,690 --> 01:06:02,940
There's no way I don't know!

1312
01:06:03,030 --> 01:06:05,230
Right? Just choose
the common hamburger steak.

1313
01:06:05,320 --> 01:06:07,820
Just choose the normal flavour.
Yes, the one you usually eat.

1314
01:06:07,900 --> 01:06:10,730
If I think it's a bit different,
that means it's wrong.

1315
01:06:11,030 --> 01:06:12,530
That's all.
It's easy.

1316
01:06:12,610 --> 01:06:13,730
You can count on me!

1317
01:06:18,360 --> 01:06:20,030
It doesn't look weird at all.

1318
01:06:20,280 --> 01:06:21,400
Not at all.

1319
01:06:21,860 --> 01:06:23,320
He looks like that when he wakes up.

1320
01:06:25,400 --> 01:06:29,440
He has a bite of the correct answer,
the common hamburger steak.

1321
01:06:29,570 --> 01:06:36,280
"A: correct. Minced beef and pork"

1322
01:06:37,480 --> 01:06:40,690
He has five children, so I think
he's had hamburger steak many times

1323
01:06:40,780 --> 01:06:42,030
with his children.

1324
01:06:42,280 --> 01:06:43,230
That's right.

1325
01:06:43,900 --> 01:06:45,530
Next, the wrong answer.

1326
01:06:45,730 --> 01:06:48,280
If he chooses this, he'll totally
lose the dignity of emperor,

1327
01:06:48,360 --> 01:06:50,610
even his family will ignore him.

1328
01:06:50,690 --> 01:06:53,530
It's hamburger steak
with deer testicles added.

1329
01:06:53,610 --> 01:06:55,110
"B: wrong"

1330
01:06:55,190 --> 01:06:56,440
How is it?

1331
01:06:57,110 --> 01:06:59,610
Okay...
I'm counting on you.

1332
01:07:00,860 --> 01:07:02,690
Which one will Show Aikawa choose?

1333
01:07:03,230 --> 01:07:05,400
His answer is...

1334
01:07:06,820 --> 01:07:07,980
Which one?

1335
01:07:08,440 --> 01:07:09,480
Well...

1336
01:07:11,280 --> 01:07:13,110
I'll choose the hamburger steak?

1337
01:07:13,400 --> 01:07:14,650
That's right!

1338
01:07:15,320 --> 01:07:16,360
Yes, you will!

1339
01:07:16,440 --> 01:07:18,480
He just wants to check, Mr Hamada.

1340
01:07:19,900 --> 01:07:21,730
The one with no testicles is B.

1341
01:07:24,980 --> 01:07:26,360
Oops...

1342
01:07:28,650 --> 01:07:30,360
The time needed till I swallow.

1343
01:07:30,820 --> 01:07:33,230
It took me much less time
to swallow B.

1344
01:07:33,440 --> 01:07:35,320
Doesn't it depend on you?

1345
01:07:38,980 --> 01:07:40,400
Senior, you're right!

1346
01:07:40,440 --> 01:07:41,730
Thank you!
It makes me feel relieved.

1347
01:07:41,860 --> 01:07:43,900
Yes, it makes me feel relieved.

1348
01:07:44,150 --> 01:07:47,030
When Mr Show comes, Kotaro too...

1349
01:07:47,110 --> 01:07:50,320
They've won.
They surely think they won.

1350
01:07:50,400 --> 01:07:52,440
It was more crowded in our room
last time, right?

1351
01:07:52,690 --> 01:07:54,780
Mr Megumi went, "Welcome!"

1352
01:07:55,110 --> 01:07:57,190
Like, "Welcome to the room
of the correct answer!"

1353
01:07:57,900 --> 01:07:58,940
Indeed.

1354
01:07:59,650 --> 01:08:03,480
Testicles Big Bro joins them
in the Testicles Room!

1355
01:08:03,570 --> 01:08:06,780
"Testicles Big Bro"

1356
01:08:06,860 --> 01:08:08,150
Wow!

1357
01:08:08,400 --> 01:08:09,650
Thank you!

1358
01:08:09,730 --> 01:08:11,110
It's B, right?
It's B.

1359
01:08:11,190 --> 01:08:12,980
It's B, right?
It can't be wrong!

1360
01:08:13,860 --> 01:08:15,230
They're totally different.

1361
01:08:15,320 --> 01:08:17,860
Totally different! I've never had
hamburger steak like that.

1362
01:08:18,400 --> 01:08:19,780
No...

1363
01:08:21,030 --> 01:08:22,780
I can sit here and feel relieved.

1364
01:08:22,900 --> 01:08:24,900
It stayed.
It took me some time.

1365
01:08:24,980 --> 01:08:26,400
It did, right?
Yes.

1366
01:08:28,610 --> 01:08:32,400
Next, their duo's name will change
to Oideyasu Kogan if they're wrong.

1367
01:08:32,480 --> 01:08:34,280
It's Oideyasu Koga.

1368
01:08:34,360 --> 01:08:36,320
"Kogaken, Oideyasu Oda"

1369
01:08:36,900 --> 01:08:39,030
First, the correct answer, A.

1370
01:08:39,110 --> 01:08:44,940
"A: correct. Minced beef and pork"

1371
01:08:45,030 --> 01:08:46,400
Is he wearing an eye mask?

1372
01:08:47,320 --> 01:08:49,480
Maybe he isn't.
Right?

1373
01:08:50,320 --> 01:08:54,280
Next, B. Hamburger steak
with deer testicles added.

1374
01:08:54,360 --> 01:08:57,320
"B: wrong.
Minced beef and deer testicles"

1375
01:08:57,400 --> 01:08:58,360
Oh.

1376
01:08:59,320 --> 01:09:00,150
Oh.

1377
01:09:01,070 --> 01:09:01,900
I see.

1378
01:09:03,940 --> 01:09:05,280
Which one is it?

1379
01:09:06,780 --> 01:09:08,650
I want Mr Kogaken here.

1380
01:09:08,730 --> 01:09:10,320
Yes, we do.

1381
01:09:12,360 --> 01:09:15,480
Oda will say B
and Kogaken will say A.

1382
01:09:15,610 --> 01:09:17,610
I'm scared!
Please guess it right.

1383
01:09:19,480 --> 01:09:20,570
Which one?

1384
01:09:21,280 --> 01:09:22,110
The common one.

1385
01:09:22,190 --> 01:09:23,780
The common hamburger steak. Okay.

1386
01:09:23,860 --> 01:09:25,440
Yes, that's right!

1387
01:09:26,320 --> 01:09:27,150
What the heck?

1388
01:09:27,230 --> 01:09:28,900
They don't want to be wrong.

1389
01:09:30,070 --> 01:09:32,440
Please...

1390
01:09:32,900 --> 01:09:34,320
Please come, Mr Kogaken!

1391
01:09:34,940 --> 01:09:36,860
The gentlemen's answers are...

1392
01:09:39,360 --> 01:09:42,400
"B: wrong.
Minced beef and deer testicles"

1393
01:09:42,570 --> 01:09:44,570
There's nothing you can do now.

1394
01:09:44,860 --> 01:09:47,650
Kogaken chose that.
They agreed.

1395
01:09:47,730 --> 01:09:48,780
Yeah.

1396
01:09:48,940 --> 01:09:50,780
Are you serious?

1397
01:09:51,440 --> 01:09:53,480
"Correct, but worried"

1398
01:09:53,570 --> 01:09:54,980
Really?

1399
01:09:55,280 --> 01:09:57,030
Yes!
Yes!

1400
01:09:57,780 --> 01:10:00,030
Yes!
Yes!

1401
01:10:00,530 --> 01:10:04,400
A is more chewy.

1402
01:10:04,440 --> 01:10:09,860
When I swallowed, I think there was
something like fibre remaining.

1403
01:10:09,940 --> 01:10:10,780
I see.

1404
01:10:10,860 --> 01:10:14,860
I don't think it's suitable
for making hamburger steak.

1405
01:10:15,110 --> 01:10:17,320
He said it!
"Not suitable."

1406
01:10:17,400 --> 01:10:18,530
But it's hamburger steak.

1407
01:10:18,610 --> 01:10:19,730
"Oideyasu Kogan"

1408
01:10:19,820 --> 01:10:23,030
The new duo Oideyasu Kogan
has formed!

1409
01:10:23,110 --> 01:10:25,690
They agreed and go
to the Cobblers Room together.

1410
01:10:26,400 --> 01:10:27,730
Oh?
Thank you.

1411
01:10:27,820 --> 01:10:28,690
Thank you...

1412
01:10:28,780 --> 01:10:31,070
It has to be!
It is, right?

1413
01:10:31,150 --> 01:10:32,980
They're totally different.

1414
01:10:33,070 --> 01:10:34,570
I also thought they were.
Yes.

1415
01:10:35,110 --> 01:10:38,150
They guessed the correct answer,
but they are quiet.

1416
01:10:38,230 --> 01:10:39,320
"Silent"

1417
01:10:40,230 --> 01:10:42,320
Lastly, Mr Yuji Nakazawa,

1418
01:10:42,400 --> 01:10:46,230
who will change his name to
Yuji Koganzawa if he guesses wrong.

1419
01:10:47,150 --> 01:10:50,110
He guessed the previous quartet
performance correctly.

1420
01:10:50,280 --> 01:10:51,530
You never know.

1421
01:10:51,610 --> 01:10:55,690
Maybe he'll guess it right.
Nakazawa is sharp today.

1422
01:10:56,190 --> 01:10:59,320
First, the correct answer,
the common hamburger steak.

1423
01:10:59,400 --> 01:11:03,150
"A: correct. Minced beef and pork"

1424
01:11:03,230 --> 01:11:04,230
Okay!

1425
01:11:04,440 --> 01:11:06,530
Oh? Is he actually sharp today?

1426
01:11:07,610 --> 01:11:10,440
This matters...

1427
01:11:10,530 --> 01:11:12,730
It decides if you can stay or not.

1428
01:11:13,400 --> 01:11:16,150
Next, the hamburger steak
with deer testicles added.

1429
01:11:16,320 --> 01:11:17,820
Don't choose this one.

1430
01:11:17,900 --> 01:11:19,570
"B: wrong"

1431
01:11:19,650 --> 01:11:22,400
Don't choose this.
You're eating the wrong answer.

1432
01:11:24,110 --> 01:11:25,730
He's nodding.

1433
01:11:25,980 --> 01:11:28,900
The way he nods...
I have a bad feeling about this.

1434
01:11:28,980 --> 01:11:29,820
Okay.

1435
01:11:30,360 --> 01:11:31,860
He nodded after B.

1436
01:11:31,940 --> 01:11:33,690
He has made up his mind.

1437
01:11:34,690 --> 01:11:36,320
Okay, which one will he choose?

1438
01:11:38,320 --> 01:11:40,730
So, I'll choose the common one?

1439
01:11:40,860 --> 01:11:42,320
That's what I said!

1440
01:11:42,610 --> 01:11:44,530
I'm telling you that's right!

1441
01:11:44,610 --> 01:11:46,400
Big Bro, we can't tell now.

1442
01:11:47,190 --> 01:11:48,280
Like it was scripted.

1443
01:11:48,610 --> 01:11:50,730
And his answer is...

1444
01:11:53,110 --> 01:11:54,360
The correct answer is...

1445
01:11:55,070 --> 01:11:55,940
B!

1446
01:11:56,030 --> 01:11:57,440
Okay, wrong!

1447
01:11:58,480 --> 01:11:59,820
That's right.

1448
01:12:00,230 --> 01:12:02,230
Yeah, it can't be helped.

1449
01:12:02,900 --> 01:12:05,400
Yes! Here he comes!

1450
01:12:06,190 --> 01:12:07,110
Look...

1451
01:12:08,110 --> 01:12:09,400
What?

1452
01:12:10,230 --> 01:12:13,030
"Even more worried"

1453
01:12:13,110 --> 01:12:14,530
When I ate A,

1454
01:12:14,780 --> 01:12:16,400
the texture and the taste

1455
01:12:16,440 --> 01:12:19,440
were not like the hamburger steak
I usually have.

1456
01:12:19,530 --> 01:12:22,480
They tried to cover it up,
but they can't deceive me.

1457
01:12:22,650 --> 01:12:24,190
You've been deceived!

1458
01:12:24,400 --> 01:12:25,730
You don't eat it usually.

1459
01:12:27,400 --> 01:12:30,570
Yuji Koganzawa joins them too!

1460
01:12:30,690 --> 01:12:33,070
"Yuji Koganzawa"

1461
01:12:33,150 --> 01:12:34,110
Hello.

1462
01:12:34,190 --> 01:12:36,190
Yes!
It's this one, right?

1463
01:12:36,280 --> 01:12:40,570
There is no way this can be wrong.

1464
01:12:41,070 --> 01:12:43,820
When I see this scene...
Yeah.

1465
01:12:44,280 --> 01:12:46,190
Let's do fist bumps.

1466
01:12:46,280 --> 01:12:48,440
It can't be wrong...

1467
01:12:48,530 --> 01:12:50,280
It can't be wrong.
I'm sure.

1468
01:12:50,820 --> 01:12:53,900
It's a standing ovation.

1469
01:12:55,730 --> 01:12:57,480
This is the most embarrassing!

1470
01:12:58,690 --> 01:13:01,690
The fateful announcement
of the result!

1471
01:13:03,650 --> 01:13:05,820
Here I am!

1472
01:13:05,900 --> 01:13:09,530
"Celeb Master enters the room
of the correct answer"

1473
01:13:09,610 --> 01:13:15,360
I'm sure we're okay...
He'll just come in smoothly.

1474
01:13:15,440 --> 01:13:18,730
I'll open the door
of the correct answer's room.

1475
01:13:19,570 --> 01:13:21,360
The correct answer is...

1476
01:13:22,690 --> 01:13:23,900
Oh...

1477
01:13:23,980 --> 01:13:25,360
"A: correct"

1478
01:13:25,440 --> 01:13:27,150
I'm sure it's okay.

1479
01:13:27,230 --> 01:13:28,280
"B: wrong"

1480
01:13:32,530 --> 01:13:36,610
Congratulations!
Yay!

1481
01:13:38,980 --> 01:13:44,650
Congratulations!
Yay!

1482
01:13:44,820 --> 01:13:46,400
"B: wrong"

1483
01:13:48,900 --> 01:13:50,650
What?
No way!

1484
01:13:50,730 --> 01:13:54,530
Are you kidding me?
No way!

1485
01:13:55,070 --> 01:13:57,860
Impossible! Impossible!

1486
01:14:05,230 --> 01:14:06,860
I give up.
Oh jeez.

1487
01:14:06,940 --> 01:14:07,780
Jeez...

1488
01:14:07,860 --> 01:14:09,980
But if there are only
a few people...

1489
01:14:10,070 --> 01:14:11,690
The other room looks like
they've won.

1490
01:14:11,780 --> 01:14:12,820
Exactly!

1491
01:14:13,860 --> 01:14:15,190
Are you kidding me?

1492
01:14:15,440 --> 01:14:16,530
I had no idea.

1493
01:14:16,610 --> 01:14:18,980
I can't believe it!
Does that happen?

1494
01:14:19,070 --> 01:14:20,780
You must be kidding me!

1495
01:14:22,940 --> 01:14:25,980
The two people who got it right!
Welcome back!

1496
01:14:26,360 --> 01:14:29,400
Well done! Brilliant! I'm impressed.

1497
01:14:30,400 --> 01:14:32,150
Well done.
Amazing.

1498
01:14:32,280 --> 01:14:36,110
It feels great, right?
The studio is so bright!

1499
01:14:36,230 --> 01:14:40,280
People who guessed the wrong answer
are back. Come in.

1500
01:14:40,360 --> 01:14:43,070
"Wrong answer entrance"

1501
01:14:43,150 --> 01:14:44,650
He's picking a fight.

1502
01:14:45,530 --> 01:14:47,820
Welcome back. Thank you.

1503
01:14:47,900 --> 01:14:49,480
Have a seat.

1504
01:14:51,190 --> 01:14:55,280
Who would've thought you'd choose
the one with testicles added?

1505
01:14:55,570 --> 01:14:57,530
This is ridiculous.

1506
01:14:58,230 --> 01:15:00,690
I don't think you can make it with
the usual minced meat,

1507
01:15:00,780 --> 01:15:01,820
even if you want to.

1508
01:15:01,900 --> 01:15:03,650
I don't think so.
No.

1509
01:15:04,110 --> 01:15:06,650
Will you stop making excuses?

1510
01:15:07,860 --> 01:15:09,110
Sorry, Yoshito.

1511
01:15:09,230 --> 01:15:12,320
Now most of the board
are the blue ones!

1512
01:15:12,400 --> 01:15:14,360
Secondrated!

1513
01:15:14,400 --> 01:15:18,440
Thirdrated here.
You'll really vanish at this rate!

1514
01:15:18,570 --> 01:15:20,400
This is bad...

1515
01:15:20,730 --> 01:15:24,150
Oops, all teams are in this
wretched state after test three.

1516
01:15:24,280 --> 01:15:28,150
Later, Team Nagashima And Koizumi
from great families

1517
01:15:28,230 --> 01:15:31,320
will do something outrageous!
Stay tuned!

1518
01:15:32,320 --> 01:15:33,690
Test four is this.

1519
01:15:34,320 --> 01:15:36,730
It's beatboxing.

1520
01:15:38,360 --> 01:15:41,610
You'll compare two performances
of beatboxing, a technique that

1521
01:15:41,690 --> 01:15:43,690
plays music using only the mouth.

1522
01:15:43,780 --> 01:15:45,400
That's right.

1523
01:15:46,400 --> 01:15:50,320
There are three options
A, B and C in this test.

1524
01:15:50,730 --> 01:15:55,320
One of them is the "absolutely no"
answer they shouldn't get wrong.

1525
01:15:55,400 --> 01:15:58,150
If they choose this,
they'll go down two ranks.

1526
01:15:58,570 --> 01:16:01,440
No!
Two ranks down at once!

1527
01:16:01,940 --> 01:16:02,780
To sum up,

1528
01:16:02,860 --> 01:16:06,860
if thirdrated celebrities go down
two ranks, they'll disappear.

1529
01:16:06,940 --> 01:16:09,480
You two will surely disappear.

1530
01:16:09,570 --> 01:16:11,280
Already?
Yes.

1531
01:16:11,360 --> 01:16:12,650
The correct answer

1532
01:16:12,730 --> 01:16:15,900
is performed by a group of four
who had won second place

1533
01:16:15,980 --> 01:16:18,820
in an international beatboxing
competition, SARUKANI.

1534
01:16:18,900 --> 01:16:20,230
They're very famous.

1535
01:16:20,940 --> 01:16:25,320
The correct answer is SARUKANI,
a group of four beatboxers.

1536
01:16:26,480 --> 01:16:29,150
In an international beatboxing
competition held last year,

1537
01:16:29,230 --> 01:16:32,320
they were the first Japanese group
that won the second place.

1538
01:16:32,530 --> 01:16:35,980
They're currently a beatboxing group
that attracts a lot of attention.

1539
01:16:36,280 --> 01:16:37,190
And...

1540
01:16:37,570 --> 01:16:38,900
In the wrong answer,

1541
01:16:38,980 --> 01:16:42,860
one comedian will replace
one of the pro beatboxers.

1542
01:16:42,980 --> 01:16:46,400
It will be this comedian,
please look at the door.

1543
01:16:49,110 --> 01:16:52,400
It's Cocorico's Mr Shozo Endo!

1544
01:16:52,480 --> 01:16:55,280
Ho ho ho!
Don't say ho ho ho!

1545
01:16:55,400 --> 01:16:57,190
We look forward to it.

1546
01:16:57,280 --> 01:17:00,320
Come on...

1547
01:17:00,480 --> 01:17:03,150
You have no firstrated celebs
already.

1548
01:17:04,070 --> 01:17:06,860
I'm a bit surprised. I see.

1549
01:17:06,980 --> 01:17:09,530
Mr Endo is wellknown
for how well he sings,

1550
01:17:09,610 --> 01:17:11,530
but it's the first time
he tries beatboxing.

1551
01:17:11,610 --> 01:17:12,530
Yes, the first time.

1552
01:17:12,650 --> 01:17:16,230
Have you been practising?
I was practising all the time.

1553
01:17:16,320 --> 01:17:18,400
He has practised for about 50 hours.

1554
01:17:18,610 --> 01:17:22,570
What I carry this time is different.
May I?

1555
01:17:23,320 --> 01:17:25,030
I'm carrying this.
Wonderful.

1556
01:17:25,110 --> 01:17:26,530
It's a collab with Mr Hamada.

1557
01:17:26,610 --> 01:17:28,940
A collab hoodie with
Mr Masatoshi Hamada.

1558
01:17:29,070 --> 01:17:31,610
I'm really going to go and make it.

1559
01:17:31,690 --> 01:17:32,530
And then...

1560
01:17:32,610 --> 01:17:34,980
And the answer you mustn't choose

1561
01:17:35,070 --> 01:17:38,570
will have one more comedian
on stage. Here he is!

1562
01:17:38,650 --> 01:17:40,280
"Two beatboxers, two comedians"

1563
01:17:40,360 --> 01:17:41,190
Hello.

1564
01:17:41,280 --> 01:17:44,230
It's Onigoe Tomahawk's Kinchan.

1565
01:17:45,230 --> 01:17:48,320
From four professionals to
having two fewer and adding them.

1566
01:17:48,400 --> 01:17:49,780
That's right.

1567
01:17:50,150 --> 01:17:52,230
It's half amateur
and half professional.

1568
01:17:52,320 --> 01:17:54,400
It's half amateur
and half professional.

1569
01:17:54,480 --> 01:17:58,730
And Kinchan had only practised
two hours.

1570
01:17:58,860 --> 01:18:01,650
Well, I mean,

1571
01:18:01,820 --> 01:18:04,150
Mr Kazushige is only
a profligate son.

1572
01:18:04,280 --> 01:18:06,940
Thirdrated.
What are you talking about?

1573
01:18:07,070 --> 01:18:09,150
Don't call me thirdrated
or profligate, idiot.

1574
01:18:09,530 --> 01:18:11,190
My background is powerful!

1575
01:18:11,530 --> 01:18:13,570
Exactly. I'm sorry.

1576
01:18:14,400 --> 01:18:18,030
It's a supereasy question
to choose the performance

1577
01:18:18,110 --> 01:18:19,650
by all pro beatboxers.

1578
01:18:19,780 --> 01:18:23,820
There's no way they'll choose
the beatboxing by comedians, right?

1579
01:18:25,320 --> 01:18:27,110
They are the representatives.

1580
01:18:27,230 --> 01:18:29,690
If Team Nagashima and Koizumi
from great families

1581
01:18:29,780 --> 01:18:32,980
choose "absolutely no,"
they'll vanish at once.

1582
01:18:33,110 --> 01:18:34,530
What do you think, Miss Karina?

1583
01:18:34,610 --> 01:18:37,280
Actually, I really love SARUKANI,

1584
01:18:37,360 --> 01:18:40,280
I watch their YouTube videos
and their Instagram.

1585
01:18:40,360 --> 01:18:41,190
Is that so?

1586
01:18:41,280 --> 01:18:44,030
Each member is really unique,

1587
01:18:44,230 --> 01:18:45,940
it's awesome.
I see.

1588
01:18:46,070 --> 01:18:48,570
I'm sure I'll know.
I see.

1589
01:18:48,860 --> 01:18:51,440
There'll be something foreign.
That's right.

1590
01:18:51,610 --> 01:18:52,440
And you?

1591
01:18:52,530 --> 01:18:57,150
My son watches their videos
on YouTube,

1592
01:18:57,900 --> 01:18:58,780
so I'm confident.

1593
01:18:58,860 --> 01:19:01,400
So you'll know. Okay.
I think so.

1594
01:19:01,610 --> 01:19:03,400
Jesse will go?
That's right.

1595
01:19:03,440 --> 01:19:06,820
The two of us among the six SixTONES
members do vocal percussion.

1596
01:19:06,940 --> 01:19:09,900
I see.
So I think maybe it's perfect.

1597
01:19:10,190 --> 01:19:11,530
That's great.

1598
01:19:11,650 --> 01:19:15,440
Okay, representatives, please go
to the room and stand by.

1599
01:19:15,570 --> 01:19:18,070
Don't get excited
and perform yourself.

1600
01:19:19,940 --> 01:19:22,400
Stay secondrated.

1601
01:19:22,530 --> 01:19:23,400
Please.

1602
01:19:23,480 --> 01:19:25,190
Do your best to stay where you are.

1603
01:19:25,280 --> 01:19:27,900
Or you'll go down one rank or two.

1604
01:19:28,650 --> 01:19:33,650
Later, comedian beatboxers
are going to cause a big drama!

1605
01:19:35,400 --> 01:19:38,400
First, these three teams will do it.

1606
01:19:40,230 --> 01:19:42,110
Please listen to it
in the studio too.

1607
01:19:42,190 --> 01:19:44,360
Yeah.
I want to guess it right.

1608
01:19:45,820 --> 01:19:49,780
They'll perform Hamachan's
famous song "WOW WAR TONIGHT."

1609
01:19:49,900 --> 01:19:52,400
Viewers, please think together
with them.

1610
01:19:53,820 --> 01:19:56,150
First, beatboxing A.

1611
01:19:56,280 --> 01:19:58,110
One, two, three, four.

1612
01:20:47,570 --> 01:20:50,110
Next, beatboxing B.

1613
01:20:50,190 --> 01:20:51,320
Two, three.

1614
01:21:39,530 --> 01:21:41,900
What?
This is difficult.

1615
01:21:41,980 --> 01:21:43,110
I can't tell.

1616
01:21:44,570 --> 01:21:47,440
Next, beatboxing C.

1617
01:21:47,530 --> 01:21:49,280
Two, three, four.

1618
01:22:33,360 --> 01:22:34,980
It's difficult.

1619
01:22:35,070 --> 01:22:38,900
This is impressive.
I can't tell.

1620
01:22:38,980 --> 01:22:40,780
Did the two amateurs really join?

1621
01:22:41,230 --> 01:22:42,070
I...

1622
01:22:42,650 --> 01:22:43,650
B is correct?

1623
01:22:43,730 --> 01:22:45,230
That's right.

1624
01:22:45,570 --> 01:22:46,780
Kotaro chooses B.

1625
01:22:47,030 --> 01:22:48,150
What do you think, Mr Show?

1626
01:22:48,230 --> 01:22:51,820
I think C was the one without noise.

1627
01:22:51,900 --> 01:22:54,650
I see.
C is the most probable one.

1628
01:22:54,780 --> 01:22:55,690
And you, Nakazawa?

1629
01:22:55,780 --> 01:22:57,820
I think it's C.

1630
01:22:58,030 --> 01:23:00,360
C was professional? I see.
It's professional.

1631
01:23:00,480 --> 01:23:03,940
I think B was the most organised.

1632
01:23:04,070 --> 01:23:05,030
Miss Marika?

1633
01:23:05,110 --> 01:23:07,320
I think B was
the professional performance,

1634
01:23:07,400 --> 01:23:12,110
A is the second best,
C is the worst one.

1635
01:23:12,190 --> 01:23:14,190
Wow.
What about you two?

1636
01:23:14,280 --> 01:23:15,780
I think it's B.

1637
01:23:15,860 --> 01:23:17,940
I think B is the professional one.

1638
01:23:18,070 --> 01:23:21,150
I think C is the one that
the two comedians joined.

1639
01:23:21,940 --> 01:23:23,690
This is bad.

1640
01:23:23,780 --> 01:23:25,650
Yeah?
This is bad.

1641
01:23:26,400 --> 01:23:28,400
At the studio, B is the majority,

1642
01:23:28,440 --> 01:23:31,230
Toshiaki Megumi,
the former music show host

1643
01:23:31,320 --> 01:23:34,480
who answered the quartet performance
wrong is here first.

1644
01:23:35,280 --> 01:23:36,940
Here he is!
He's here...

1645
01:23:37,110 --> 01:23:38,900
Will he agree with Mr Show?

1646
01:23:39,230 --> 01:23:40,230
What will he choose?

1647
01:23:40,320 --> 01:23:41,320
"Thinks it's C"

1648
01:23:41,780 --> 01:23:43,230
His answer is...

1649
01:23:43,320 --> 01:23:44,400
The correct answer is...

1650
01:23:46,190 --> 01:23:47,150
B.

1651
01:23:50,860 --> 01:23:56,360
I had many opportunities to listen
to professional musicians play,

1652
01:23:56,400 --> 01:23:59,820
so I naturally know
the sound of firstrated music.

1653
01:23:59,900 --> 01:24:02,610
I think B and C are tricky,

1654
01:24:02,690 --> 01:24:06,070
but no doubt B was done
more skilfully.

1655
01:24:06,650 --> 01:24:08,230
I see, it's B first.

1656
01:24:08,360 --> 01:24:11,730
Mr Show, you chose C,
but Megumi chose B.

1657
01:24:13,530 --> 01:24:15,400
Well...

1658
01:24:16,230 --> 01:24:19,570
What will the fate of the former
"MUSIC FAIR" host be?

1659
01:24:19,650 --> 01:24:21,230
"Wrong on quartet performance"

1660
01:24:21,900 --> 01:24:26,280
Next, Miss Fuka Koshiba, who guessed
the quartet performance right.

1661
01:24:27,070 --> 01:24:28,440
Here she is.

1662
01:24:28,570 --> 01:24:30,690
Miss Koshiba.
She got the one just now right.

1663
01:24:30,780 --> 01:24:33,440
We'll see where she goes to.

1664
01:24:33,530 --> 01:24:34,820
Yeah.

1665
01:24:35,440 --> 01:24:38,070
The answer she gives
after worrying about it is...

1666
01:24:39,690 --> 01:24:40,610
B.

1667
01:24:41,570 --> 01:24:42,440
It's B.

1668
01:24:42,530 --> 01:24:43,730
"Thinks it's B"

1669
01:24:43,820 --> 01:24:49,610
The part where the song ended
was very beautiful, I think.

1670
01:24:49,900 --> 01:24:51,280
I see.
A lovely smile.

1671
01:24:51,360 --> 01:24:52,190
Pretty.

1672
01:24:53,070 --> 01:24:56,280
Koshiba will decide whether they
stay as common celebrities or not,

1673
01:24:56,360 --> 01:24:57,440
she also goes to B.

1674
01:24:58,860 --> 01:25:00,480
You're here!

1675
01:25:00,610 --> 01:25:02,030
Oh!
Thank goodness!

1676
01:25:02,280 --> 01:25:04,860
It's really difficult, right?
It was.

1677
01:25:05,070 --> 01:25:07,030
Excuse me.

1678
01:25:07,150 --> 01:25:08,860
I had no idea.

1679
01:25:10,110 --> 01:25:13,480
Next, their answers on
the quartet performance agreed,

1680
01:25:13,570 --> 01:25:14,820
but Nogizaka46's three ladies

1681
01:25:14,900 --> 01:25:17,610
embarrassed themselves
by guessing it wrong.

1682
01:25:17,730 --> 01:25:20,780
We'll see whether you'll go
from second to thirdrated,

1683
01:25:20,860 --> 01:25:22,150
or lookalikes,

1684
01:25:22,230 --> 01:25:23,980
if they get this wrong.

1685
01:25:24,360 --> 01:25:26,360
Their answers are...

1686
01:25:27,400 --> 01:25:29,320
Wow!
Wow!

1687
01:25:29,400 --> 01:25:30,650
This is impressive.

1688
01:25:31,070 --> 01:25:32,820
Wait, I've seen this before.

1689
01:25:32,900 --> 01:25:33,980
Yes, we have.

1690
01:25:34,070 --> 01:25:35,400
Isn't this bad?

1691
01:25:35,650 --> 01:25:36,480
This...

1692
01:25:37,150 --> 01:25:40,070
We saw this scene just now too.
We chose B as well.

1693
01:25:40,150 --> 01:25:41,980
I remember this!

1694
01:25:42,480 --> 01:25:45,230
I would pay to listen to B.

1695
01:25:45,320 --> 01:25:47,150
I know,
I want to listen to B properly.

1696
01:25:47,230 --> 01:25:48,400
But what happened just now...

1697
01:25:48,480 --> 01:25:49,570
But...

1698
01:25:50,110 --> 01:25:51,480
They're so pessimistic!

1699
01:25:51,780 --> 01:25:54,030
That's really...
Consider that too.

1700
01:25:54,110 --> 01:25:55,400
B was wrong last time,

1701
01:25:55,480 --> 01:25:57,110
so this time it's B.
Indeed.

1702
01:25:57,780 --> 01:26:00,730
All of them chose B.

1703
01:26:00,940 --> 01:26:02,190
Wait, I don't know now.

1704
01:26:03,690 --> 01:26:07,110
Nogizaka, Megumi got the quartet
performance wrong and chose B.

1705
01:26:07,190 --> 01:26:09,780
I've seen this before.
It's an awful Deja vu.

1706
01:26:09,860 --> 01:26:10,860
Excuse me.

1707
01:26:13,360 --> 01:26:14,690
You're here.

1708
01:26:14,780 --> 01:26:16,360
I'm happy.

1709
01:26:16,400 --> 01:26:18,730
We feel relieved,
We feel relieved.

1710
01:26:18,820 --> 01:26:21,900
but the way it goes like this
hasn't been good so far.

1711
01:26:22,110 --> 01:26:24,650
It looks like Megumi
is at a hostess club.

1712
01:26:24,730 --> 01:26:26,610
"At hostess club"

1713
01:26:26,690 --> 01:26:29,280
The level is high. It's expensive.

1714
01:26:30,400 --> 01:26:35,190
Is the correct answer A, B or C?

1715
01:26:35,400 --> 01:26:38,570
We'll tell everyone at the studio
the correct answer.

1716
01:26:38,730 --> 01:26:40,280
I'm happy.

1717
01:26:40,400 --> 01:26:41,530
The correct answer is...

1718
01:26:41,610 --> 01:26:42,480
Please be B!

1719
01:26:42,570 --> 01:26:44,150
B.
Yay!

1720
01:26:44,230 --> 01:26:47,400
That's right...

1721
01:26:47,480 --> 01:26:48,900
Thank goodness!
And...

1722
01:26:49,730 --> 01:26:51,360
The Absolutely No Room.

1723
01:26:51,480 --> 01:26:52,820
Okay...

1724
01:26:54,610 --> 01:26:55,440
C.

1725
01:26:56,320 --> 01:26:57,730
Thank goodness!

1726
01:26:58,480 --> 01:26:59,480
Thank goodness.

1727
01:27:00,070 --> 01:27:04,030
Everyone, did you know the answer?
The correct answer is B.

1728
01:27:04,110 --> 01:27:07,190
It was performed only by SARUKANI,

1729
01:27:07,280 --> 01:27:09,610
the famous Japanese worldclass
beatboxer group.

1730
01:27:10,190 --> 01:27:13,150
Professional beatboxers like us
practise every day

1731
01:27:13,230 --> 01:27:14,780
to improve the quality of sound.

1732
01:27:14,860 --> 01:27:17,900
So compared to amateurs,
besides the sound,

1733
01:27:17,980 --> 01:27:21,070
even the tempo and the stability
of volume are completely different.

1734
01:27:22,570 --> 01:27:23,940
Maybe it's bad

1735
01:27:24,070 --> 01:27:26,400
to have so many people.
It's a big scary.

1736
01:27:26,610 --> 01:27:27,650
Maybe it's a trick question.

1737
01:27:27,730 --> 01:27:30,860
They look worried,
but they all guessed correctly.

1738
01:27:31,530 --> 01:27:37,230
But later, the comedian beatboxers
will cause big drama!

1739
01:27:38,650 --> 01:27:40,320
Next, these four teams,

1740
01:27:40,400 --> 01:27:44,780
including thirdrated celebrity
Kazushige Nagashima, will be tested.

1741
01:27:44,940 --> 01:27:47,150
Okay...

1742
01:27:47,530 --> 01:27:49,610
Let's begin the test!

1743
01:27:54,280 --> 01:27:58,820
Now, please watch and compare it
with the comedians' performance.

1744
01:28:00,070 --> 01:28:02,070
Mr Shozo joins them here?

1745
01:28:03,730 --> 01:28:04,940
First, it's the wrong answer,

1746
01:28:05,030 --> 01:28:08,900
A, of which Cocorico's Endo
will do the percussion.

1747
01:28:08,980 --> 01:28:10,190
Three, four.

1748
01:28:10,280 --> 01:28:17,280
"A: wrong. 3 professionals
and Cocorico's Endo"

1749
01:28:18,400 --> 01:28:19,730
He's good.

1750
01:28:55,150 --> 01:28:57,440
Wow!
It was good...

1751
01:28:57,780 --> 01:28:59,530
It was good.
Impressive.

1752
01:29:00,280 --> 01:29:01,860
Next, the correct answer,

1753
01:29:01,940 --> 01:29:06,110
B, performed by the four worldclass
professionals, SARUKANI.

1754
01:29:06,190 --> 01:29:12,610
"B: correct. SARUKANI, second place
in international competition"

1755
01:29:20,280 --> 01:29:22,730
"Percussion: Kohey"

1756
01:29:22,820 --> 01:29:25,400
"Base: RUSY"

1757
01:29:25,480 --> 01:29:28,150
"Bass drum and others: KAJI"

1758
01:29:28,230 --> 01:29:30,980
"Trumpet and others: SOSO"

1759
01:29:52,650 --> 01:29:55,230
They're good.
Now that you mention it.

1760
01:29:55,320 --> 01:29:57,280
It's a decent performance.

1761
01:29:58,030 --> 01:29:59,780
Next, the absolutely no answer,

1762
01:29:59,860 --> 01:30:03,030
C, by Endo and Onigoe's Kinchan
who plays the bass

1763
01:30:03,110 --> 01:30:05,440
after practising only for two hours.

1764
01:30:05,530 --> 01:30:12,530
"C: absolutely no. 2 professionals,
Cocorico's Endo, Kinchan"

1765
01:30:14,900 --> 01:30:16,440
He's doing a lot!

1766
01:30:16,860 --> 01:30:18,900
This! It's this!
His breathing sound!

1767
01:30:50,610 --> 01:30:52,360
Oh no.
What's this?

1768
01:30:52,400 --> 01:30:53,980
Oh no.
Oh!

1769
01:30:54,400 --> 01:30:56,480
The participants are confused.

1770
01:30:56,570 --> 01:30:58,070
Kazushige probably can't tell.

1771
01:30:58,190 --> 01:31:00,280
He surely doesn't.
He's thinking hard.

1772
01:31:00,860 --> 01:31:02,400
Mr Kazushige's thinking hard.

1773
01:31:02,980 --> 01:31:03,980
"B: correct"

1774
01:31:04,070 --> 01:31:07,400
I have no idea when I listen.
It's difficult.

1775
01:31:08,110 --> 01:31:11,280
Will they choose
the correct answer, B?

1776
01:31:12,650 --> 01:31:17,320
First, also a beatboxer,
SixTONES's Mr Jesse.

1777
01:31:17,780 --> 01:31:20,610
Jesse!
I'm counting on you, Jesse!

1778
01:31:20,690 --> 01:31:22,980
If he chooses C...

1779
01:31:23,320 --> 01:31:25,150
His answer is...

1780
01:31:26,820 --> 01:31:28,280
B.
Yay!

1781
01:31:28,780 --> 01:31:30,230
Nice!
Brilliant.

1782
01:31:30,440 --> 01:31:32,360
Impressive.
Nice!

1783
01:31:32,480 --> 01:31:35,110
I judge by the volume
when I listen to music,

1784
01:31:35,190 --> 01:31:38,940
the volume of B was the most equal
and I heard every note,

1785
01:31:39,070 --> 01:31:42,980
and no doubt C was performed
by comedians.

1786
01:31:43,400 --> 01:31:45,030
Wow, this is rather good.
Impressive!

1787
01:31:45,110 --> 01:31:46,820
What a relief!

1788
01:31:47,480 --> 01:31:49,900
That's someone
who had done it before!

1789
01:31:49,980 --> 01:31:51,860
He successfully stays
as common celebrity.

1790
01:31:51,940 --> 01:31:53,400
You're here!
Wow!

1791
01:31:53,780 --> 01:31:55,110
Jesse!

1792
01:31:55,320 --> 01:31:56,610
Yay!

1793
01:31:56,860 --> 01:31:58,530
Welcome!

1794
01:31:58,780 --> 01:32:00,320
It's very lively there.

1795
01:32:00,980 --> 01:32:02,570
They meet up at this club.

1796
01:32:05,610 --> 01:32:10,570
Next, Karina, who claimed
being a fan of SARUKANI.

1797
01:32:10,650 --> 01:32:11,780
"Karina"

1798
01:32:12,110 --> 01:32:13,610
She said she listened
to their music.

1799
01:32:13,690 --> 01:32:15,480
Yes, it's a lucky question.

1800
01:32:15,650 --> 01:32:18,570
Yes, it is to her.
Yes, an easy question.

1801
01:32:19,440 --> 01:32:21,280
Her answer is...

1802
01:32:21,400 --> 01:32:22,280
I'll say it.

1803
01:32:23,030 --> 01:32:23,860
B.

1804
01:32:25,690 --> 01:32:26,940
Wow!
I'm impressed.

1805
01:32:27,070 --> 01:32:28,610
Impressive.

1806
01:32:29,400 --> 01:32:32,360
Wow, everyone answered correctly
so far.

1807
01:32:33,690 --> 01:32:35,980
Wow! Amazing!

1808
01:32:36,110 --> 01:32:37,070
Everyone chose B!

1809
01:32:37,190 --> 01:32:39,320
We're so happy.
Wow.

1810
01:32:39,690 --> 01:32:41,480
Thank goodness!
But this is also...

1811
01:32:41,570 --> 01:32:44,280
Yeah.
Is this okay?

1812
01:32:44,820 --> 01:32:46,570
But if they think about
what happened so far,

1813
01:32:46,650 --> 01:32:49,320
they might think
there are too many people.

1814
01:32:49,820 --> 01:32:51,940
I think they're a bit worried too.

1815
01:32:52,070 --> 01:32:54,980
Like, "Could it be..."
Seeing how it goes, it's possible.

1816
01:32:56,360 --> 01:33:01,280
Next, Yoshito Okubo, who had also
listened to SARUKANI.

1817
01:33:02,070 --> 01:33:03,360
Okay...

1818
01:33:03,610 --> 01:33:06,570
He's here!
It's okay, he is very confident.

1819
01:33:06,650 --> 01:33:07,650
Really?

1820
01:33:07,730 --> 01:33:08,780
He'll be okay.

1821
01:33:11,070 --> 01:33:12,440
He looks confident.

1822
01:33:12,530 --> 01:33:14,900
Secondrated or thirdrated?
Or will you become lookalikes?

1823
01:33:14,980 --> 01:33:15,860
It's okay.

1824
01:33:16,900 --> 01:33:18,820
His answer is...

1825
01:33:20,860 --> 01:33:21,820
A.

1826
01:33:21,900 --> 01:33:25,110
Oh! The first different answer!

1827
01:33:26,070 --> 01:33:28,530
It isn't C...
Well, it's fine.

1828
01:33:28,860 --> 01:33:32,940
I think they were trying a bit hard
to do B and C.

1829
01:33:33,150 --> 01:33:34,780
When I heard them,

1830
01:33:35,150 --> 01:33:37,780
I thought,
"Wow, they're making effort."

1831
01:33:37,860 --> 01:33:41,820
A was the easiest on the ear,

1832
01:33:43,030 --> 01:33:43,900
so it's this.

1833
01:33:44,230 --> 01:33:45,070
This...

1834
01:33:45,610 --> 01:33:48,980
He'll be alone when he's there.
This is awful.

1835
01:33:49,320 --> 01:33:50,570
It's bad to be in A alone.

1836
01:33:50,650 --> 01:33:53,070
It feels lonely to wait so long
on his own.

1837
01:33:53,530 --> 01:33:58,320
Pay attention to how he reacts
when he opens the door.

1838
01:33:59,820 --> 01:34:02,280
Wow! Are you kidding me?

1839
01:34:02,900 --> 01:34:04,110
Nobody is here?

1840
01:34:04,400 --> 01:34:07,360
Wow!

1841
01:34:07,440 --> 01:34:10,400
But it'll be impressive if you win.

1842
01:34:10,530 --> 01:34:11,940
You might win by yourself.

1843
01:34:12,030 --> 01:34:14,570
I might win alone.
You might.

1844
01:34:15,360 --> 01:34:17,480
Mr Kazushige, just don't choose C.

1845
01:34:18,030 --> 01:34:19,280
Just not C.

1846
01:34:19,360 --> 01:34:21,360
Well, there's a chance.

1847
01:34:22,400 --> 01:34:24,030
If you look at his face.
Yeah.

1848
01:34:25,230 --> 01:34:28,070
Lastly, it's thirdrated celebrity
Kazushige Nagashima,

1849
01:34:28,150 --> 01:34:29,610
who is at the end of his rope.

1850
01:34:29,690 --> 01:34:32,400
He'll vanish at once
if he chooses C.

1851
01:34:32,570 --> 01:34:34,110
Okay, it's here.

1852
01:34:34,190 --> 01:34:36,360
Here he is.
I hope you can stay!

1853
01:34:36,400 --> 01:34:38,780
He'll vanish the moment he raises
the card of C.

1854
01:34:38,860 --> 01:34:39,900
Oh no.
A would be good.

1855
01:34:39,980 --> 01:34:42,360
Do your best, Kazushige!
Do your best!

1856
01:34:46,150 --> 01:34:48,320
His answer is...

1857
01:34:48,530 --> 01:34:49,980
It's no use thinking.

1858
01:34:50,190 --> 01:34:51,070
Do your best!

1859
01:34:51,150 --> 01:34:53,440
"C: absolutely no,
2 professionals and 2 comedians"

1860
01:34:53,530 --> 01:34:54,980
He vanished!

1861
01:34:58,730 --> 01:34:59,940
Are you kidding me?

1862
01:35:03,980 --> 01:35:05,230
Are you kidding me?

1863
01:35:06,320 --> 01:35:07,730
He messed up!

1864
01:35:07,900 --> 01:35:09,610
We've vanished now?

1865
01:35:09,820 --> 01:35:11,280
Are you kidding me?

1866
01:35:11,650 --> 01:35:16,900
I thought the voltage of C was high
at last.

1867
01:35:17,110 --> 01:35:18,360
He is sure.

1868
01:35:19,030 --> 01:35:21,280
This is bad.
It's unexpected.

1869
01:35:21,360 --> 01:35:24,110
Mr Kotaro Koizumi has vanished.

1870
01:35:25,280 --> 01:35:27,610
Nagashima vanished,

1871
01:35:27,690 --> 01:35:33,530
so this time, Hollywood Zakoshisyoh
will play him exaggeratedly.

1872
01:35:33,820 --> 01:35:34,980
Is it this room?

1873
01:35:35,480 --> 01:35:37,730
What? No one is here. I messed up...

1874
01:35:38,400 --> 01:35:40,230
I don't want to be on my own.

1875
01:35:40,320 --> 01:35:41,230
Hello.

1876
01:35:41,320 --> 01:35:43,440
Hello.
Everyone chose B?

1877
01:35:43,610 --> 01:35:44,820
It's interesting!

1878
01:35:45,030 --> 01:35:47,280
Okubo!
We're in different rooms.

1879
01:35:47,480 --> 01:35:48,610
This is fine.

1880
01:35:48,690 --> 01:35:50,650
"Nagashima"

1881
01:35:50,730 --> 01:35:52,230
I don't know anymore.

1882
01:35:53,980 --> 01:35:57,280
The fateful announcement
of the result!

1883
01:35:58,610 --> 01:35:59,900
Oh jeez!

1884
01:36:00,400 --> 01:36:03,570
I'll vanish if it's the worst one.
I give up.

1885
01:36:04,400 --> 01:36:06,690
He's already vanished
and became Zakoshi,

1886
01:36:06,780 --> 01:36:10,400
but please enjoy his own
nervous facial expression.

1887
01:36:11,860 --> 01:36:14,230
Here I am!

1888
01:36:14,980 --> 01:36:15,860
Okay!

1889
01:36:16,900 --> 01:36:18,440
"Useless praying"

1890
01:36:18,530 --> 01:36:19,940
Please come!

1891
01:36:20,030 --> 01:36:22,190
Please!
We can't lose this fight.

1892
01:36:22,610 --> 01:36:25,650
"Futile expectation"

1893
01:36:25,730 --> 01:36:31,030
I'll first open the door of the room
that makes you go down one rank.

1894
01:36:31,440 --> 01:36:32,360
That's what he does?

1895
01:36:32,400 --> 01:36:33,780
"A: wrong"

1896
01:36:33,860 --> 01:36:36,030
I see!
That's right.

1897
01:36:36,690 --> 01:36:38,150
I'll be happy with that.

1898
01:36:39,190 --> 01:36:40,230
Let's do it.

1899
01:36:42,570 --> 01:36:43,690
Wait...

1900
01:36:44,440 --> 01:36:46,730
Don't come here...

1901
01:36:46,820 --> 01:36:49,110
"C: absolutely no"

1902
01:36:50,860 --> 01:36:52,940
Oh, I knew it.

1903
01:36:53,320 --> 01:36:55,070
Thank goodness it's one rank down.
One.

1904
01:36:55,150 --> 01:36:57,360
Yes. Thank goodness!

1905
01:36:58,400 --> 01:37:00,440
Oh, I knew it.

1906
01:37:00,820 --> 01:37:02,570
Thank goodness it's one rank down.
One.

1907
01:37:02,650 --> 01:37:04,820
Yes. Thank goodness!

1908
01:37:05,070 --> 01:37:06,530
What?

1909
01:37:06,780 --> 01:37:08,360
It's one rank down...

1910
01:37:08,400 --> 01:37:10,230
It's either B or C!
Oh no!

1911
01:37:10,320 --> 01:37:11,400
It's us.

1912
01:37:12,400 --> 01:37:14,570
What?

1913
01:37:15,690 --> 01:37:16,730
Thank goodness!

1914
01:37:16,820 --> 01:37:19,400
You go down one rank,
but you're hanging in there.

1915
01:37:19,480 --> 01:37:20,440
But I'm happy.

1916
01:37:21,360 --> 01:37:22,780
It can't be helped.

1917
01:37:23,820 --> 01:37:27,480
I'll open the door
of the correct answer's room.

1918
01:37:27,570 --> 01:37:28,650
It has to be B!

1919
01:37:28,900 --> 01:37:32,530
If I don't open your door,
you go down two ranks.

1920
01:37:32,610 --> 01:37:33,730
Let's do it.

1921
01:37:35,940 --> 01:37:37,900
He'll come...

1922
01:37:39,320 --> 01:37:40,980
Sorry, Kotaro!

1923
01:37:49,980 --> 01:37:52,230
Congratulations!

1924
01:37:54,150 --> 01:37:56,610
Yay!
Yay!

1925
01:37:57,230 --> 01:37:59,190
Congratulations!

1926
01:38:01,320 --> 01:38:03,860
Yay!
Yay!

1927
01:38:04,070 --> 01:38:06,480
"C: absolutely no"

1928
01:38:06,570 --> 01:38:07,980
What?

1929
01:38:10,860 --> 01:38:13,230
Kotaro, sorry, I messed up...

1930
01:38:15,150 --> 01:38:17,530
Team Nagashima And Koizumi
from great families

1931
01:38:17,610 --> 01:38:19,230
got all the answers wrong today.

1932
01:38:19,320 --> 01:38:23,900
There are two more questions,
but they've already disappeared.

1933
01:38:24,440 --> 01:38:26,900
Everyone, what a fight, oh?

1934
01:38:27,280 --> 01:38:28,940
Oh?
Hang on.

1935
01:38:29,030 --> 01:38:30,280
They vanished.

1936
01:38:30,650 --> 01:38:32,190
You can't see our forms?

1937
01:38:32,280 --> 01:38:34,150
No.
Because you aren't here.

1938
01:38:34,280 --> 01:38:36,650
We'll disappear?
You have disappeared.

1939
01:38:36,730 --> 01:38:37,820
We've disappeared?

1940
01:38:38,280 --> 01:38:40,690
It's too early. I wish you would
stay for longer.

1941
01:38:40,940 --> 01:38:44,280
But there are two more questions.

1942
01:38:44,780 --> 01:38:46,440
Everyone, think carefully.

1943
01:38:47,280 --> 01:38:49,570
It is the Koizumi Family
and the Nagashima Family.

1944
01:38:49,730 --> 01:38:52,150
This is bad.

1945
01:38:52,280 --> 01:38:54,230
The moment Mr Kazushige raised C,

1946
01:38:54,320 --> 01:38:56,280
the whole crew
buried their heads in their hands.

1947
01:38:56,400 --> 01:38:58,690
Yes, indeed!

1948
01:38:58,820 --> 01:39:00,480
I felt so restless.
Exactly.

1949
01:39:00,570 --> 01:39:01,480
What do you guys think?

1950
01:39:01,570 --> 01:39:03,400
Will you make the Koizumi Family

1951
01:39:03,440 --> 01:39:05,150
and the Nagashima Family
your enemies?

1952
01:39:05,320 --> 01:39:07,730
Absolutely not...

1953
01:39:07,820 --> 01:39:08,650
Not at all.

1954
01:39:08,730 --> 01:39:11,230
Let's restore them
to lookalikes first,

1955
01:39:11,320 --> 01:39:14,480
they'll vanish if they get the next
one wrong. It can't be helped.

1956
01:39:14,650 --> 01:39:19,320
But is it okay to give them grace?
That's what I want to ask.

1957
01:39:19,610 --> 01:39:21,110
What do you think?

1958
01:39:21,610 --> 01:39:23,190
Are you not happy?

1959
01:39:23,280 --> 01:39:25,530
But it's the rule, so no.

1960
01:39:27,070 --> 01:39:29,440
I think it's okay, though.
Hang on.

1961
01:39:30,030 --> 01:39:32,940
No...

1962
01:39:33,030 --> 01:39:34,730
Oda, you're nice!

1963
01:39:34,820 --> 01:39:37,030
Kogaken! Kogaken said no.

1964
01:39:37,110 --> 01:39:39,230
I'm just playing dumb, obviously!

1965
01:39:39,570 --> 01:39:41,730
I'm just playing dumb, obviously!

1966
01:39:41,900 --> 01:39:43,400
Koga, I'll make it clear.

1967
01:39:43,440 --> 01:39:46,650
My dad and the Koizumi Family's dad
are influencing Japan.

1968
01:39:46,730 --> 01:39:47,690
Wait!

1969
01:39:49,900 --> 01:39:53,360
That's...

1970
01:39:53,440 --> 01:39:54,650
No, that's...

1971
01:39:54,730 --> 01:39:56,820
None of us can afford
to make them our enemies.

1972
01:39:56,900 --> 01:39:58,190
Yeah...

1973
01:39:58,280 --> 01:40:03,110
We'll restore you to lookalikes,
is that okay?

1974
01:40:03,230 --> 01:40:04,440
Thank you!

1975
01:40:04,530 --> 01:40:06,400
You're lookalikes,
Okay!

1976
01:40:06,570 --> 01:40:08,190
so do an impression of them.

1977
01:40:08,400 --> 01:40:09,440
Yes! What would you like?

1978
01:40:09,650 --> 01:40:11,650
So we'll show their faces for now.

1979
01:40:12,860 --> 01:40:14,650
Camera six.
Okay, please do it.

1980
01:40:15,400 --> 01:40:16,530
How about this?

1981
01:40:18,480 --> 01:40:19,530
Who's that?

1982
01:40:19,900 --> 01:40:20,980
Impression of my dad.

1983
01:40:22,360 --> 01:40:24,530
Please come back!

1984
01:40:24,900 --> 01:40:26,150
It's our special rule!

1985
01:40:26,230 --> 01:40:30,400
Team Nagashima and Koizumi
makes a comeback!

1986
01:40:30,980 --> 01:40:33,780
But you'll vanish
if your answer is wrong next time.

1987
01:40:33,860 --> 01:40:36,360
Of course!
I'm sorry.

1988
01:40:36,440 --> 01:40:38,110
We'll stand.
Yes, please.

1989
01:40:38,230 --> 01:40:39,320
I'm happy!

1990
01:40:39,400 --> 01:40:41,530
Okay, let's do our next test!

1991
01:40:41,610 --> 01:40:43,030
Test five is this.

1992
01:40:43,110 --> 01:40:44,400
"Coloured carp"

1993
01:40:44,480 --> 01:40:46,320
It's coloured carp.

1994
01:40:46,780 --> 01:40:48,280
This...

1995
01:40:49,150 --> 01:40:54,070
coloured carp is called Swimming
Jewels and Japan's national fish.

1996
01:40:55,400 --> 01:40:57,820
Since they originated 200 years ago,

1997
01:40:57,900 --> 01:40:59,530
they've been undergoing
selective breeding

1998
01:40:59,610 --> 01:41:02,820
to create coloured carps
that are even more beautiful.

1999
01:41:04,360 --> 01:41:07,320
Nowadays, the coloured carps
Japan is proud of

2000
01:41:07,400 --> 01:41:09,530
are loved by about 50 countries.

2001
01:41:09,860 --> 01:41:12,940
We'll check whether the participants
are good judges or not.

2002
01:41:13,400 --> 01:41:16,360
The correct answer is a coloured
carp that costs 3 million yen.

2003
01:41:16,400 --> 01:41:17,860
3 million!
That's right.

2004
01:41:17,940 --> 01:41:20,400
If it wins on a competitive show,

2005
01:41:20,480 --> 01:41:25,900
the promising coloured carp might
cost over 10 million yen.

2006
01:41:25,980 --> 01:41:26,940
That's right.

2007
01:41:27,030 --> 01:41:29,940
The wrong answer is
a very ordinary coloured carp,

2008
01:41:30,030 --> 01:41:31,440
which costs 10,000 yen.

2009
01:41:31,570 --> 01:41:32,690
That's right.

2010
01:41:32,980 --> 01:41:33,980
Spot the difference.

2011
01:41:34,070 --> 01:41:35,940
It costs 3 million yen currently.
Yes.

2012
01:41:36,030 --> 01:41:37,530
And 10,000 yen.
Yes.

2013
01:41:38,360 --> 01:41:42,230
This time, we have the cooperation
of TANI FISH FARM.

2014
01:41:43,230 --> 01:41:44,980
Its scale is the largest
in the Kanto region.

2015
01:41:45,070 --> 01:41:48,860
The coloured carp are kept in
a place as big as Tokyo Dome,

2016
01:41:49,320 --> 01:41:51,940
and there are 100,000 carp.

2017
01:41:52,480 --> 01:41:56,150
Among them, we prepared
the three representative species,

2018
01:41:56,320 --> 01:41:59,530
Taisho Sanshoku and Showa Sanshoku.

2019
01:42:00,280 --> 01:42:04,820
They should know the topclass
3 million yen carp at a glance.

2020
01:42:05,400 --> 01:42:07,440
Please announce the representatives.

2021
01:42:07,570 --> 01:42:10,610
From Team Yokai Housemate,
Miss Marika Matsumoto.

2022
01:42:10,690 --> 01:42:12,230
Thank you.

2023
01:42:12,320 --> 01:42:13,480
This one?

2024
01:42:13,730 --> 01:42:15,900
From Team Soccer, Yuji Nakazawa.

2025
01:42:16,030 --> 01:42:18,230
Okay, thank you.

2026
01:42:18,360 --> 01:42:20,610
No honorific?
I see, I'm thirdrated.

2027
01:42:20,730 --> 01:42:23,400
From Team Nagashima and Koizumi,

2028
01:42:23,440 --> 01:42:25,400
the guy who looks like
Kotaro Koizumi.

2029
01:42:25,440 --> 01:42:28,070
Okay, thank you.

2030
01:42:28,780 --> 01:42:29,820
Thank you.

2031
01:42:30,230 --> 01:42:32,610
The other participants are as shown.

2032
01:42:32,730 --> 01:42:36,360
Team Nagashima and Koizumi came back
by special favour,

2033
01:42:36,400 --> 01:42:38,570
so don't vanish again!

2034
01:42:38,730 --> 01:42:41,400
Okay, first,
common celeb, Miss Matsumoto.

2035
01:42:41,570 --> 01:42:44,400
It's 10,000 yen and 3 million yen?

2036
01:42:44,650 --> 01:42:46,530
There's no way I'll get it wrong.

2037
01:42:48,030 --> 01:42:49,730
Right? Okay.

2038
01:42:49,860 --> 01:42:52,110
I think they'll look
totally different.

2039
01:42:52,190 --> 01:42:53,940
I'll know the moment I see it.

2040
01:42:54,190 --> 01:42:55,030
"Ha!"

2041
01:42:55,110 --> 01:42:56,730
Sorry.
Why are you laughing?

2042
01:42:56,820 --> 01:42:58,820
Nagashima!
Why do you laugh?

2043
01:42:58,900 --> 01:43:01,360
He looks more like
Kazushige Nagashima.

2044
01:43:01,900 --> 01:43:02,820
Is this okay?

2045
01:43:04,320 --> 01:43:05,610
Okay, and...

2046
01:43:06,070 --> 01:43:07,190
You really look like him.

2047
01:43:07,280 --> 01:43:08,360
Thank you.

2048
01:43:08,440 --> 01:43:10,820
Amazing.
You look exactly like him.

2049
01:43:11,110 --> 01:43:12,480
I'll put this on you.

2050
01:43:13,780 --> 01:43:15,980
You look so like him!
Thank you.

2051
01:43:16,070 --> 01:43:17,480
This isn't Mr Koizumi himself.

2052
01:43:17,570 --> 01:43:19,110
How about this, Mr Lookalike?

2053
01:43:19,190 --> 01:43:20,400
Well...

2054
01:43:20,530 --> 01:43:22,570
I haven't answered
one question correctly.

2055
01:43:23,820 --> 01:43:24,690
He said it.

2056
01:43:24,860 --> 01:43:26,650
Yes, this team lost every time.

2057
01:43:26,730 --> 01:43:30,150
I'll choose the correct answer
and pass to Mr Kazushige's...

2058
01:43:30,320 --> 01:43:32,030
lookalike.
We want to do one more question.

2059
01:43:32,110 --> 01:43:34,400
Yes.
I'll get this one.

2060
01:43:34,440 --> 01:43:36,530
Okay, representatives, please come!

2061
01:43:36,730 --> 01:43:37,980
To the room and stand by.

2062
01:43:39,280 --> 01:43:40,780
The one that impresses you!

2063
01:43:40,900 --> 01:43:42,900
That's right! Okay.

2064
01:43:42,980 --> 01:43:45,900
I'll go with my instinct,
without thinking too much.

2065
01:43:48,730 --> 01:43:51,280
Isn't Kotaro amazing?
He got all of them wrong.

2066
01:43:51,650 --> 01:43:53,070
Me too.
What?

2067
01:43:53,150 --> 01:43:54,820
I also failed twice in a row.

2068
01:43:54,900 --> 01:43:56,780
They both lost every time.

2069
01:43:56,900 --> 01:43:58,530
I can't believe this...

2070
01:43:59,780 --> 01:44:00,940
I'm shocked.

2071
01:44:01,650 --> 01:44:05,650
Two kinds of coloured carp
are standing by here at A and B.

2072
01:44:05,780 --> 01:44:08,320
They'll come in pairs
to observe the carp carefully.

2073
01:44:09,940 --> 01:44:14,780
First, Kotaro Koizumi's lookalike,
who can't afford to vanish again,

2074
01:44:14,900 --> 01:44:17,730
and secondrated celebrity
Show Aikawa.

2075
01:44:17,820 --> 01:44:18,730
"Show Aikawa"

2076
01:44:18,820 --> 01:44:20,150
Kotaro, I'm counting on you!

2077
01:44:20,530 --> 01:44:22,320
Yeah, this one matters.

2078
01:44:22,400 --> 01:44:24,610
I want to do one more question.

2079
01:44:25,480 --> 01:44:29,320
They'll take turns to look
at the carp for 30 seconds each.

2080
01:44:31,400 --> 01:44:34,650
Our viewers will start from A.

2081
01:44:34,730 --> 01:44:38,190
"Coloured carp A"

2082
01:44:38,320 --> 01:44:39,690
It's beautiful.

2083
01:44:48,650 --> 01:44:50,360
Next, B.

2084
01:44:50,440 --> 01:44:57,230
"Coloured carp B"

2085
01:45:02,980 --> 01:45:04,230
3 million yen.

2086
01:45:04,320 --> 01:45:06,780
There's no way I'll know.

2087
01:45:07,320 --> 01:45:08,820
Oh...

2088
01:45:09,190 --> 01:45:12,480
Please compare the two carp
at last.

2089
01:45:14,440 --> 01:45:16,400
This one is beautiful too.

2090
01:45:23,400 --> 01:45:25,190
This is difficult.

2091
01:45:25,440 --> 01:45:26,860
What do you think, Mr Megumi?

2092
01:45:27,230 --> 01:45:28,530
I think it's B.

2093
01:45:28,650 --> 01:45:29,980
Oh, I see.

2094
01:45:30,230 --> 01:45:32,230
And you, Jesse?
I also think it's B.

2095
01:45:32,360 --> 01:45:35,530
A moves like it's looking for food.

2096
01:45:35,730 --> 01:45:37,820
A carp that costs 3 million yen
won't do that.

2097
01:45:37,900 --> 01:45:41,070
Come on! You don't know that!

2098
01:45:41,320 --> 01:45:44,230
The orange part of B is larger,

2099
01:45:44,570 --> 01:45:46,940
it somehow fascinates me,

2100
01:45:47,530 --> 01:45:48,980
but I'll outwit them and choose A.

2101
01:45:49,070 --> 01:45:51,320
What will Kotaro choose, then?

2102
01:45:52,610 --> 01:45:55,320
First, Kotaro Koizumi's lookalike,

2103
01:45:55,400 --> 01:45:57,440
who really is
at the end of his rope.

2104
01:45:58,440 --> 01:45:59,730
Kotaro, choose A!

2105
01:46:03,070 --> 01:46:05,570
We'll remove you mercilessly
if you're wrong.

2106
01:46:05,690 --> 01:46:07,230
His answer is...

2107
01:46:08,320 --> 01:46:09,190
This.

2108
01:46:09,280 --> 01:46:10,230
"Coloured carp B"

2109
01:46:10,320 --> 01:46:11,610
I think it's B.

2110
01:46:12,150 --> 01:46:13,320
Oh...

2111
01:46:13,400 --> 01:46:14,610
It's B.
B.

2112
01:46:15,190 --> 01:46:16,190
Different from yours.

2113
01:46:17,480 --> 01:46:21,150
They are both swimming leisurely,

2114
01:46:22,860 --> 01:46:24,400
they have the vibes too.

2115
01:46:26,480 --> 01:46:27,650
"Poot"

2116
01:46:27,730 --> 01:46:29,280
Are you okay?

2117
01:46:29,360 --> 01:46:30,440
You fart now?

2118
01:46:32,190 --> 01:46:33,230
Now?

2119
01:46:35,400 --> 01:46:37,360
Coloured carp B...

2120
01:46:38,690 --> 01:46:40,190
Do you call it classy?

2121
01:46:41,320 --> 01:46:44,110
I felt something like that.

2122
01:46:45,030 --> 01:46:46,480
I missed half of that.

2123
01:46:46,570 --> 01:46:47,610
Exactly.

2124
01:46:47,690 --> 01:46:49,900
The sound of his fart.
Whose fault is this?

2125
01:46:50,150 --> 01:46:51,480
Mr Hamada!

2126
01:46:51,570 --> 01:46:53,940
Do your job properly!
I'm sorry.

2127
01:46:54,030 --> 01:46:56,570
He said B...
How can the host fart?

2128
01:46:58,150 --> 01:47:01,480
Okay, I want to see Mr Hamada
at the end.

2129
01:47:02,610 --> 01:47:05,360
Will this be Kotaro's
first correct answer today?

2130
01:47:05,400 --> 01:47:08,070
Or will he vanish again?

2131
01:47:11,240 --> 01:47:16,950
Who Is The Real Celebrity BASIC,
threehour programme in spring!

2132
01:47:17,030 --> 01:47:18,780
The spring grading consists of

2133
01:47:18,870 --> 01:47:23,950
super basic tests that
they should obviously guess right.

2134
01:47:24,410 --> 01:47:28,410
The Spring Grading consists of tests
on basic knowledge they should know.

2135
01:47:28,490 --> 01:47:30,120
The correct answer is...

2136
01:47:30,950 --> 01:47:33,410
For example,
in the string quartet performance,

2137
01:47:34,030 --> 01:47:37,530
they'll compare the most expensive
musical instrument

2138
01:47:37,620 --> 01:47:38,950
to one that lacks a string.

2139
01:47:39,620 --> 01:47:42,580
The tasting test
is also a basic test

2140
01:47:42,990 --> 01:47:46,200
on comparing the finest quality
squid to Kanetsu Delica Foods'

2141
01:47:46,280 --> 01:47:51,620
unreleased product, Hobohobo Ika,
which is made with fish paste.

2142
01:47:52,120 --> 01:47:53,780
Are you kidding me?

2143
01:47:54,660 --> 01:47:59,030
Of course, if they get it wrong,
their rank will go down

2144
01:47:59,120 --> 01:48:03,240
and vanish from the screen
at the end, so be careful!

2145
01:48:04,370 --> 01:48:06,990
Next, secondrated actor
Big Bro Aikawa,

2146
01:48:07,080 --> 01:48:10,370
who didn't even know
the taste of hamburger steak.

2147
01:48:10,830 --> 01:48:12,700
Mr Show must be good at this.

2148
01:48:12,780 --> 01:48:15,410
He looks at rhinoceros beetles
all the time.

2149
01:48:15,490 --> 01:48:17,200
Rhinoceros beetle and coloured carp
are different.

2150
01:48:17,280 --> 01:48:20,620
They are. I mean, he would look
at living creatures.

2151
01:48:20,700 --> 01:48:23,160
His answer is...

2152
01:48:24,080 --> 01:48:26,370
The correct answer is A.

2153
01:48:26,830 --> 01:48:29,240
Oh? It's different.
It's different.

2154
01:48:29,330 --> 01:48:30,700
They're different.

2155
01:48:32,030 --> 01:48:36,240
The black of A was vivid.
I see.

2156
01:48:36,330 --> 01:48:39,830
Somehow it looks
more attractive to me.

2157
01:48:39,910 --> 01:48:42,950
They've chosen different answers
already. A and B.

2158
01:48:42,990 --> 01:48:44,910
They're different already.

2159
01:48:44,950 --> 01:48:46,700
What will happen?

2160
01:48:47,280 --> 01:48:50,490
Their opinions are already divided.

2161
01:48:51,410 --> 01:48:55,620
Oh... This is the first time
I enter Room A.

2162
01:48:55,700 --> 01:48:57,780
Mr Show chose A?

2163
01:48:58,280 --> 01:49:00,870
"Worried"

2164
01:49:00,950 --> 01:49:02,580
Go somewhere easier to see.

2165
01:49:02,660 --> 01:49:06,330
The remaining five teams
will do the test together.

2166
01:49:07,780 --> 01:49:11,740
Coloured carp B is indeed...

2167
01:49:15,240 --> 01:49:17,080
Next, coloured carp B.

2168
01:49:17,160 --> 01:49:23,830
"Coloured carp B"

2169
01:49:24,410 --> 01:49:26,120
It's hard to tell.

2170
01:49:26,200 --> 01:49:27,910
This is...

2171
01:49:27,950 --> 01:49:29,120
"Waiting room B"

2172
01:49:29,740 --> 01:49:31,740
Failed twice in a row
personally today,

2173
01:49:31,830 --> 01:49:36,120
Ryuta Sato hasn't performed well.
Which one will he choose?

2174
01:49:36,740 --> 01:49:38,370
Which one?

2175
01:49:39,620 --> 01:49:41,410
His answer is...

2176
01:49:41,490 --> 01:49:44,120
This is the correct answer.

2177
01:49:45,700 --> 01:49:46,950
B.

2178
01:49:48,030 --> 01:49:49,990
It is much more radiant.

2179
01:49:50,080 --> 01:49:53,620
It wasn't only
the carp in the water,

2180
01:49:53,700 --> 01:49:56,950
the whole zone B... what is it?

2181
01:49:56,990 --> 01:49:59,450
The atmosphere was different.

2182
01:50:01,370 --> 01:50:05,200
Someone who got two questions wrong
is really unconvincing.

2183
01:50:05,280 --> 01:50:07,030
Kotaro too.

2184
01:50:07,120 --> 01:50:08,740
Yes, indeed.

2185
01:50:09,200 --> 01:50:13,330
Now, the two gentlemen who got
two wrong answers in a row are in B.

2186
01:50:13,830 --> 01:50:14,830
Hello.

2187
01:50:14,910 --> 01:50:16,580
Oh, wow!

2188
01:50:16,990 --> 01:50:18,990
Oh, wow...

2189
01:50:19,080 --> 01:50:20,780
Well...

2190
01:50:20,870 --> 01:50:21,950
"Waiting room A"

2191
01:50:22,030 --> 01:50:23,950
But you haven't gotten any right.
Exactly.

2192
01:50:24,660 --> 01:50:26,660
You can't say thank you.

2193
01:50:26,740 --> 01:50:30,030
We lost together just now too.

2194
01:50:30,780 --> 01:50:36,580
Is the three million yen
coloured carp A or B?

2195
01:50:36,660 --> 01:50:41,030
Now, we'll tell everyone in
the studio the correct answer.

2196
01:50:41,120 --> 01:50:43,080
Wait, I will vanish now?

2197
01:50:43,160 --> 01:50:44,910
That's right.
Yes.

2198
01:50:44,950 --> 01:50:46,280
If he got it wrong.

2199
01:50:46,370 --> 01:50:48,330
The correct answer is...

2200
01:50:49,200 --> 01:50:50,780
B.
Yes!

2201
01:50:50,870 --> 01:50:52,120
Kotaro!
Thank goodness.

2202
01:50:52,200 --> 01:50:53,660
Kotaro...

2203
01:50:53,740 --> 01:50:55,240
You made it, Kotaro!

2204
01:50:55,330 --> 01:50:56,490
As expected.

2205
01:50:56,580 --> 01:50:57,780
You guys will stay.

2206
01:50:57,870 --> 01:51:00,200
Mr Kazushige continues to be
a lookalike.

2207
01:51:00,950 --> 01:51:03,410
Did you know the answer?

2208
01:51:03,490 --> 01:51:07,950
B is the correct answer,
the three million yen coloured carp.

2209
01:51:08,030 --> 01:51:12,620
A good carp needs to have
a symmetrical body,

2210
01:51:12,700 --> 01:51:15,870
and it swims beautifully.

2211
01:51:15,950 --> 01:51:19,700
Regarding the pattern, there should
be black spots on the white body.

2212
01:51:19,780 --> 01:51:22,830
This is the secret of a good carp.

2213
01:51:23,620 --> 01:51:26,330
I haven't
answered one right, either.

2214
01:51:26,990 --> 01:51:29,870
I'm gradually
losing selfconfidence.

2215
01:51:29,950 --> 01:51:31,160
I've got none.

2216
01:51:31,240 --> 01:51:32,330
Why do I feel defeated?

2217
01:51:32,410 --> 01:51:35,620
Don't worry.
You answered correctly this time.

2218
01:51:36,030 --> 01:51:41,030
On the other hand, poor
Team Kagoshima falls to thirdrate.

2219
01:51:41,120 --> 01:51:43,410
I got all five questions wrong.

2220
01:51:44,410 --> 01:51:45,950
Impressive.

2221
01:51:45,990 --> 01:51:47,030
"Thirdrated"

2222
01:51:47,120 --> 01:51:50,080
We have one more thirdrated team.

2223
01:51:51,080 --> 01:51:55,450
Next, Oideyasu Koga will decide
if the team will stay secondrated.

2224
01:51:56,450 --> 01:51:58,120
Okay, here they are.

2225
01:51:59,080 --> 01:52:02,950
Their opinions will probably
be divided.

2226
01:52:03,490 --> 01:52:06,120
Will they choose B?

2227
01:52:06,200 --> 01:52:07,990
Ready, go.

2228
01:52:09,450 --> 01:52:11,700
See? They're divided.

2229
01:52:14,490 --> 01:52:16,410
Oh, not this.
Give the correct answer.

2230
01:52:16,490 --> 01:52:18,160
The first one I saw? Okay. Sorry.

2231
01:52:18,240 --> 01:52:19,370
The expensive one?
Yes.

2232
01:52:19,950 --> 01:52:20,950
What?
Gosh!

2233
01:52:21,030 --> 01:52:22,740
Why?

2234
01:52:22,830 --> 01:52:24,200
He scared me.

2235
01:52:24,280 --> 01:52:27,620
The fin of B was white,
and the texture was fine.

2236
01:52:27,700 --> 01:52:29,740
It was very beautiful.

2237
01:52:29,830 --> 01:52:32,030
The two carp were totally different.

2238
01:52:32,120 --> 01:52:34,620
You're safe.
Thank goodness!

2239
01:52:34,700 --> 01:52:36,280
Nogizaka is safe.

2240
01:52:36,370 --> 01:52:37,870
They stay secondrated.

2241
01:52:38,490 --> 01:52:40,240
They almost got it wrong
for a second

2242
01:52:40,330 --> 01:52:42,160
but managed to correct it.

2243
01:52:43,830 --> 01:52:46,330
Yes!
Yes!

2244
01:52:46,410 --> 01:52:47,990
Thank you!
I don't think you're happy, though.

2245
01:52:48,080 --> 01:52:49,870
Don't say that...

2246
01:52:50,950 --> 01:52:52,490
Nice. It's lively there.

2247
01:52:52,580 --> 01:52:54,700
"Worried"

2248
01:52:54,780 --> 01:52:57,580
I think Mr Show hasn't given up.

2249
01:52:57,660 --> 01:53:01,580
Or he wouldn't sit like that.
Indeed. He's sitting like that.

2250
01:53:01,660 --> 01:53:02,660
"A: wrong"

2251
01:53:03,240 --> 01:53:05,450
Three teams answered B so far,

2252
01:53:05,530 --> 01:53:09,990
and Miss Marika Matsumoto
wants to stay "common."

2253
01:53:10,080 --> 01:53:11,950
Here she is.

2254
01:53:12,030 --> 01:53:15,030
If she goes to B,
she'll stay as common celeb.

2255
01:53:15,120 --> 01:53:17,200
What does the lady think?

2256
01:53:17,280 --> 01:53:20,160
Her answer is...

2257
01:53:20,620 --> 01:53:22,120
It's B.

2258
01:53:24,030 --> 01:53:25,780
Why don't you say A?

2259
01:53:27,830 --> 01:53:30,950
When I saw B, what is it?

2260
01:53:30,990 --> 01:53:33,990
Something... The aura was different.

2261
01:53:34,080 --> 01:53:35,660
You're safe.
Yes.

2262
01:53:35,740 --> 01:53:38,490
Common. Common celebrity.
Amazing. Yes.

2263
01:53:38,580 --> 01:53:40,030
Wow.
Impressive.

2264
01:53:40,870 --> 01:53:44,160
Now four teams besides Aikawa
answered correctly.

2265
01:53:45,330 --> 01:53:47,950
Oh!
It really is this!

2266
01:53:48,030 --> 01:53:50,830
As I thought.
Good...

2267
01:53:50,910 --> 01:53:53,530
Nice. It's lively there.

2268
01:53:53,620 --> 01:53:54,870
I'm sorry...

2269
01:53:54,950 --> 01:53:56,950
Sorry, Senior.
We didn't mean it.

2270
01:53:56,990 --> 01:54:00,870
Well, you would naturally
be excited.

2271
01:54:01,950 --> 01:54:03,950
Mr Show is getting a bit worried.

2272
01:54:03,990 --> 01:54:05,830
He got a bit worried.

2273
01:54:05,910 --> 01:54:07,160
"Rather worried"

2274
01:54:07,660 --> 01:54:10,580
Will our lonely Big Bro
get any friends?

2275
01:54:10,660 --> 01:54:14,490
Next, common celebrity,
SixTONES's Mr Kochi.

2276
01:54:14,580 --> 01:54:15,990
It's him.

2277
01:54:16,080 --> 01:54:18,740
Kochi.
This matters a lot.

2278
01:54:19,530 --> 01:54:21,950
Which one will he choose?

2279
01:54:22,030 --> 01:54:25,910
The three million yen
coloured carp is...

2280
01:54:27,620 --> 01:54:29,080
B.

2281
01:54:29,160 --> 01:54:31,280
Yes!
Wow!

2282
01:54:31,370 --> 01:54:32,200
They impress me.

2283
01:54:32,280 --> 01:54:34,080
Kochi has answered many correctly.

2284
01:54:34,160 --> 01:54:35,950
They all impress me.

2285
01:54:36,580 --> 01:54:39,030
Okay, it's one against five now.

2286
01:54:40,910 --> 01:54:42,910
Wow!

2287
01:54:42,950 --> 01:54:44,780
Good...

2288
01:54:44,870 --> 01:54:46,740
Good...
Welcome.

2289
01:54:46,830 --> 01:54:51,240
"Hopeless"

2290
01:54:51,830 --> 01:54:54,620
Will Show Aikawa fail on his own?

2291
01:54:54,700 --> 01:54:57,780
Next, it's Yuji Nakazawa.

2292
01:54:58,240 --> 01:55:00,450
He doesn't know at all.
He doesn't.

2293
01:55:00,530 --> 01:55:01,870
He doesn't know.

2294
01:55:02,530 --> 01:55:05,160
Will he choose
the correct answer, B? Now, come!

2295
01:55:05,240 --> 01:55:07,490
The three million yen carp is...

2296
01:55:08,080 --> 01:55:09,740
B.

2297
01:55:09,830 --> 01:55:11,870
Nice!
What?

2298
01:55:11,950 --> 01:55:13,660
Nice.
Wow, he guessed right.

2299
01:55:13,740 --> 01:55:15,410
Amazing!

2300
01:55:15,490 --> 01:55:19,950
Wow, everyone besides Aikawa
answered correctly.

2301
01:55:21,280 --> 01:55:22,740
Yay!

2302
01:55:22,830 --> 01:55:25,830
Yay!

2303
01:55:25,910 --> 01:55:28,160
This has to be the correct answer!

2304
01:55:28,240 --> 01:55:29,780
"A: wrong"

2305
01:55:29,870 --> 01:55:33,330
Well, I had no idea it would make me
feel so worried on my own.

2306
01:55:35,660 --> 01:55:38,780
The fateful announcement
of the result.

2307
01:55:38,870 --> 01:55:40,990
Here I am!

2308
01:55:41,080 --> 01:55:44,990
"Celeb Master enters the room
of the correct answer"

2309
01:55:45,080 --> 01:55:47,740
I want just one correct answer.
Yeah.

2310
01:55:47,830 --> 01:55:50,450
Really.
That's right.

2311
01:55:50,530 --> 01:55:52,490
The correct answer is...

2312
01:55:55,240 --> 01:55:58,450
"Has not given up yet"

2313
01:55:58,530 --> 01:56:00,700
Please...
What...?

2314
01:56:00,780 --> 01:56:01,620
No...

2315
01:56:03,530 --> 01:56:05,490
Congratulations!

2316
01:56:05,580 --> 01:56:08,200
Yes!

2317
01:56:08,280 --> 01:56:09,990
We made it! We made it!

2318
01:56:10,740 --> 01:56:12,740
Yay!

2319
01:56:12,830 --> 01:56:15,160
We made it! We made it!

2320
01:56:15,240 --> 01:56:17,080
Yay! Yay!

2321
01:56:17,160 --> 01:56:21,330
Congratulations!

2322
01:56:21,410 --> 01:56:24,530
Yay! Yay!

2323
01:56:24,620 --> 01:56:25,990
Your life is saved.

2324
01:56:26,080 --> 01:56:28,490
The last one.
Good for you.

2325
01:56:28,580 --> 01:56:31,240
You can now go to do
the last question.

2326
01:56:32,780 --> 01:56:34,030
Darn it!

2327
01:56:34,120 --> 01:56:35,870
It's so annoying.

2328
01:56:37,950 --> 01:56:41,740
Now, everyone, the gentleman
who got it wrong is back.

2329
01:56:42,410 --> 01:56:44,990
"Wrong answer entrance"

2330
01:56:45,080 --> 01:56:46,370
I'm sorry.

2331
01:56:46,450 --> 01:56:48,330
"I'm sorry"

2332
01:56:48,410 --> 01:56:50,580
He's going to perform harakiri.

2333
01:56:50,660 --> 01:56:53,240
I admit defeat.

2334
01:56:53,330 --> 01:56:55,530
Thank you.

2335
01:56:55,620 --> 01:56:58,700
Thank you.
Thanks, really.

2336
01:56:58,780 --> 01:57:03,160
Big Bro Show, you only know
about rhinoceros beetles!

2337
01:57:03,740 --> 01:57:06,240
Let's do our last test!

2338
01:57:06,330 --> 01:57:08,030
This is the last test.

2339
01:57:08,120 --> 01:57:09,490
"Deepfried squid"

2340
01:57:09,580 --> 01:57:10,950
Deepfried squid.

2341
01:57:10,990 --> 01:57:12,370
"Lookalike"

2342
01:57:12,450 --> 01:57:16,240
Celebrities taste and compare
expensive beef in the New Year,

2343
01:57:16,330 --> 01:57:17,660
but this is the basics,

2344
01:57:17,740 --> 01:57:19,120
so you'll taste deepfried squid,

2345
01:57:19,200 --> 01:57:20,830
the common folks' dish
everyone likes.

2346
01:57:20,910 --> 01:57:22,200
That's right.

2347
01:57:22,280 --> 01:57:27,030
There'll be three options,
A, B, and C, in this test.

2348
01:57:27,120 --> 01:57:28,530
What? Again?

2349
01:57:28,620 --> 01:57:30,330
Again?

2350
01:57:30,410 --> 01:57:32,530
Make it two!
Give us only two options!

2351
01:57:32,620 --> 01:57:35,120
I have to choose among three.

2352
01:57:35,200 --> 01:57:37,950
This is the last question.
Listen carefully.

2353
01:57:38,030 --> 01:57:39,870
First, the correct deepfried squid

2354
01:57:39,950 --> 01:57:43,370
is made with fresh squid
from Toyama Prefecture.

2355
01:57:43,450 --> 01:57:45,450
Looks delicious!
This is the correct answer.

2356
01:57:45,530 --> 01:57:51,080
The wrong deepfried squid is made
with imported frozen squid.

2357
01:57:51,160 --> 01:57:54,280
The one
you absolutely shouldn't choose

2358
01:57:54,370 --> 01:57:55,910
isn't even squid.

2359
01:57:55,950 --> 01:57:57,080
Not squid?

2360
01:57:57,160 --> 01:57:58,330
Please come forward!

2361
01:57:58,410 --> 01:57:59,700
"Come forward"?

2362
01:57:59,780 --> 01:58:01,530
What does that mean?

2363
01:58:01,620 --> 01:58:02,530
Hello!

2364
01:58:03,330 --> 01:58:05,280
This is the Hobo Series'
manufacturer,

2365
01:58:05,370 --> 01:58:08,410
Kanetetsu Delica Foods'
official character, Tecchan.

2366
01:58:08,490 --> 01:58:09,780
Kanetetsu.

2367
01:58:09,870 --> 01:58:12,740
I think some of you know

2368
01:58:12,830 --> 01:58:15,200
Kanetetsu Delica Foods
has been selling HoboKani,

2369
01:58:15,280 --> 01:58:19,950
which tastes like crab but isn't,
and other products.

2370
01:58:20,030 --> 01:58:21,910
And this time, you'll try...

2371
01:58:22,990 --> 01:58:24,780
Hobohobo Ika.

2372
01:58:24,870 --> 01:58:27,490
There are two "hobo"?

2373
01:58:27,580 --> 01:58:28,450
Two times "hobo."

2374
01:58:28,530 --> 01:58:33,080
Like HoboKani,
it is made with fish paste.

2375
01:58:33,160 --> 01:58:34,870
To sum up, it's fish paste cake.

2376
01:58:34,950 --> 01:58:36,700
Fish paste cake!
It's not squid.

2377
01:58:36,780 --> 01:58:40,990
The developer isn't confident,
so it hasn't been commercialised.

2378
01:58:41,080 --> 01:58:42,910
What?
That's right.

2379
01:58:42,950 --> 01:58:44,280
If this time

2380
01:58:44,370 --> 01:58:50,660
it can deceive even one person,
the product will be commercialised.

2381
01:58:51,580 --> 01:58:52,950
Wow!

2382
01:58:52,990 --> 01:58:56,240
The day you choose Hobohobo Ika...

2383
01:58:56,330 --> 01:58:59,830
It's only fish paste cake.

2384
01:59:00,910 --> 01:59:03,580
Taste and compare real squid
and fish paste cake,

2385
01:59:03,660 --> 01:59:05,660
and choose the right one
in this easy question.

2386
01:59:05,740 --> 01:59:08,740
You almost can't be wrong!

2387
01:59:08,830 --> 01:59:12,740
Common celebrities will be promoted
to firstrated if they get it right.

2388
01:59:12,830 --> 01:59:14,120
Yes!

2389
01:59:14,200 --> 01:59:17,530
If you can stay "common" till here,
you're already firstrated.

2390
01:59:17,620 --> 01:59:19,990
You'll be firstrated
if you answer correctly.

2391
01:59:20,080 --> 01:59:23,160
But Mr Hamada...
If you choose Hobohobo Ika,

2392
01:59:23,620 --> 01:59:24,450
you'll vanish.

2393
01:59:24,530 --> 01:59:27,120
What? Why?

2394
01:59:27,200 --> 01:59:29,990
What? Just once?
At once?

2395
01:59:30,080 --> 01:59:32,410
If you get it right,
you're firstrated.

2396
01:59:32,490 --> 01:59:34,030
If it's wrong, you vanish.

2397
01:59:34,700 --> 01:59:36,700
It's so harsh!

2398
01:59:37,370 --> 01:59:39,700
These are the representatives.

2399
01:59:39,780 --> 01:59:41,950
They'll be awfully embarrassed
if they disappear.

2400
01:59:41,990 --> 01:59:44,620
So please don't disappear!

2401
01:59:45,120 --> 01:59:47,580
Okay, go to do the last question!

2402
01:59:47,660 --> 01:59:50,950
Representative, please!

2403
01:59:53,370 --> 01:59:55,490
Let's be firstrated!
We'll be firstrated.

2404
01:59:55,580 --> 01:59:57,580
Please do your best.

2405
01:59:57,660 --> 01:59:59,620
Wow, it's fun.

2406
02:00:00,240 --> 02:00:02,580
Now, everyone. The last question.

2407
02:00:02,660 --> 02:00:04,450
I'll tell you
the correct answer now.

2408
02:00:04,530 --> 02:00:06,280
Beforehand?
Beforehand?

2409
02:00:06,370 --> 02:00:08,660
It'll make us so nervous!
It's fun!

2410
02:00:08,740 --> 02:00:12,030
The correct deepfried squid is...

2411
02:00:12,120 --> 02:00:13,080
C.

2412
02:00:13,160 --> 02:00:14,370
C.

2413
02:00:14,450 --> 02:00:16,950
If a common celeb chooses it,
they'll be back to firstrated.

2414
02:00:16,990 --> 02:00:18,870
That's what it is?
C is correct.

2415
02:00:18,950 --> 02:00:20,950
Now, "absolutely no."

2416
02:00:20,990 --> 02:00:23,280
The Hobohobo Ika.
Hobohobo Ika.

2417
02:00:24,620 --> 02:00:25,490
B.

2418
02:00:25,580 --> 02:00:27,700
I see.
Frozen is A.

2419
02:00:27,780 --> 02:00:29,700
Knowing this,

2420
02:00:29,780 --> 02:00:31,990
let's have a drink together.

2421
02:00:33,200 --> 02:00:35,660
The best thing to go with sake.
That's right.

2422
02:00:36,490 --> 02:00:40,080
You'll vanish at once if you
choose B, so don't choose it.

2423
02:00:40,160 --> 02:00:42,160
Promise me. Promise!

2424
02:00:43,200 --> 02:00:45,700
The first one here is...

2425
02:00:45,780 --> 02:00:46,950
Thank you.

2426
02:00:46,990 --> 02:00:48,700
Mr Kazushige Nagashima's lookalike,

2427
02:00:48,780 --> 02:00:52,580
who had vanished once
and is at the end of his rope.

2428
02:00:52,660 --> 02:00:55,120
It has started.
We start from Mr Kazushige?

2429
02:00:55,200 --> 02:00:56,910
Mr Kazushige is here first.
Right away!

2430
02:00:56,950 --> 02:00:59,330
He has to choose C
for this team to stay.

2431
02:00:59,410 --> 02:01:01,160
Only C for you.
Only C.

2432
02:01:01,240 --> 02:01:03,410
You'll vanish the moment
he raises the card of A or B.

2433
02:01:03,490 --> 02:01:04,330
Not even A.

2434
02:01:04,410 --> 02:01:05,740
That's right, not even A.

2435
02:01:05,830 --> 02:01:08,200
They're already lookalikes.
You can't go down further.

2436
02:01:08,660 --> 02:01:11,660
First, it makes them go down
one rank and disappear.

2437
02:01:11,740 --> 02:01:13,620
The frozen squid...

2438
02:01:13,700 --> 02:01:15,030
"A: wrong"

2439
02:01:15,120 --> 02:01:17,700
Mr Kazushige always eats good food.

2440
02:01:18,410 --> 02:01:19,780
I can't tell.

2441
02:01:19,870 --> 02:01:21,950
He can't tell.
Wait...

2442
02:01:22,030 --> 02:01:24,780
It's something he usually eats.
That's right.

2443
02:01:25,330 --> 02:01:28,700
Then, Hobohobo Ika,
which isn't squid.

2444
02:01:28,780 --> 02:01:30,740
He has to know this.

2445
02:01:30,830 --> 02:01:31,870
"B: absolutely no"

2446
02:01:31,950 --> 02:01:33,740
They must be totally different.

2447
02:01:34,120 --> 02:01:36,910
It's not commercialised.
It's fish paste cake.

2448
02:01:38,410 --> 02:01:39,620
What?

2449
02:01:39,700 --> 02:01:41,950
It doesn't feel wrong?

2450
02:01:42,410 --> 02:01:44,080
Now, C.

2451
02:01:44,160 --> 02:01:48,780
Correct answer, the expensive squid.
Just choose this!

2452
02:01:48,870 --> 02:01:51,280
It's only C.
You can only choose this.

2453
02:01:52,530 --> 02:01:55,620
I can't decide. Which one is it?

2454
02:01:56,330 --> 02:01:57,990
From Toyama Prefecture...

2455
02:01:58,080 --> 02:01:59,830
Say C, and you'll be right.

2456
02:01:59,910 --> 02:02:00,740
Comefrombehind.

2457
02:02:00,830 --> 02:02:02,160
Comefrombehind.

2458
02:02:02,240 --> 02:02:03,950
Mr Kazushige, C! You can do it!

2459
02:02:03,990 --> 02:02:05,950
Vanish if he says A or B.

2460
02:02:06,450 --> 02:02:08,120
I'll pluck up my courage.

2461
02:02:08,490 --> 02:02:13,830
Will we see Zakoshi again,
or will he stay? His answer is...

2462
02:02:13,910 --> 02:02:15,950
The squid from Toyama is...

2463
02:02:16,950 --> 02:02:18,160
C.

2464
02:02:18,660 --> 02:02:19,830
Wow!

2465
02:02:19,910 --> 02:02:21,580
Amazing!

2466
02:02:21,660 --> 02:02:22,950
They survived!

2467
02:02:23,030 --> 02:02:24,950
Impressive!

2468
02:02:24,990 --> 02:02:25,950
Amazing!

2469
02:02:26,030 --> 02:02:27,740
Thank you!
You survived!

2470
02:02:27,830 --> 02:02:31,080
It isn't the taste.
It's the texture.

2471
02:02:31,160 --> 02:02:33,370
C was the chewy one.

2472
02:02:33,450 --> 02:02:35,160
Impressive!
Amazing!

2473
02:02:35,240 --> 02:02:37,200
You each got one right.

2474
02:02:37,280 --> 02:02:40,120
I hit it once,
and he did a home run.

2475
02:02:40,200 --> 02:02:41,620
Amazing!

2476
02:02:41,700 --> 02:02:44,490
Oh, someone, please come.
I feel lonely.

2477
02:02:44,580 --> 02:02:47,450
This is a miracle. Amazing!

2478
02:02:47,530 --> 02:02:50,240
He got his first correct answer
today at last.

2479
02:02:51,620 --> 02:02:56,580
Next, it's Toshiaki Megumi,
who wants to hang on to thirdrate.

2480
02:02:56,660 --> 02:02:59,990
Mr Megumi. I'm worried!
Mr Megumi.

2481
02:03:03,200 --> 02:03:07,780
First, the frozen squid that
makes him go down one rank.

2482
02:03:07,870 --> 02:03:09,780
I don't want to be
a lookalike, either.

2483
02:03:09,870 --> 02:03:11,530
Indeed.

2484
02:03:13,080 --> 02:03:15,370
As the host of a daytime show,

2485
02:03:15,450 --> 02:03:19,530
he can't afford to mistake
fish paste cake for expensive squid.

2486
02:03:19,620 --> 02:03:20,830
"C: correct"

2487
02:03:20,910 --> 02:03:22,990
Megumi, do it! Megumi!

2488
02:03:23,080 --> 02:03:25,950
What will he choose?
Say B, Megumi!

2489
02:03:25,990 --> 02:03:28,120
Don't say B, no matter what.

2490
02:03:29,780 --> 02:03:31,450
Do it, Megumi! Do it!

2491
02:03:31,530 --> 02:03:34,910
The expensive deepfried squid...
Do it...

2492
02:03:36,330 --> 02:03:37,490
is C.

2493
02:03:37,580 --> 02:03:38,830
Yes!

2494
02:03:38,910 --> 02:03:40,700
Wow!
Amazing!

2495
02:03:40,780 --> 02:03:44,030
It's correct, so they stay
as thirdrated celebrities.

2496
02:03:44,120 --> 02:03:47,950
It was the most chewy one.

2497
02:03:48,030 --> 02:03:50,410
As a strategy,

2498
02:03:50,490 --> 02:03:55,530
the hardest one is probably
the most expensive, in fact.

2499
02:03:55,620 --> 02:03:57,370
Wonderful.

2500
02:03:57,450 --> 02:03:58,950
Amazing.

2501
02:03:58,990 --> 02:04:00,950
You stay as thirdrated.

2502
02:04:01,450 --> 02:04:03,450
Megumi barely stays as thirdrated

2503
02:04:03,530 --> 02:04:06,580
and goes to C, where Mr Kazushige's
lookalike is waiting.

2504
02:04:07,620 --> 02:04:08,870
Oh!

2505
02:04:09,700 --> 02:04:10,620
Bye.

2506
02:04:10,700 --> 02:04:11,950
Oh, wait!

2507
02:04:12,030 --> 02:04:12,950
He closed it.

2508
02:04:15,120 --> 02:04:16,950
He thought it was over.

2509
02:04:17,030 --> 02:04:17,910
Oh?

2510
02:04:17,950 --> 02:04:19,950
You chose the same as me.
You're in trouble.

2511
02:04:19,990 --> 02:04:23,410
This is bad!
It is.

2512
02:04:24,200 --> 02:04:26,700
But they answered it correctly.

2513
02:04:26,780 --> 02:04:28,950
That said,
they're supposed to be right.

2514
02:04:28,990 --> 02:04:30,660
"Worried but correct"

2515
02:04:31,240 --> 02:04:34,280
Next, thirdrated former
Japan national football team player,

2516
02:04:34,370 --> 02:04:36,280
Yoshito Okubo.

2517
02:04:36,870 --> 02:04:38,620
I can't see at all.

2518
02:04:39,580 --> 02:04:41,990
It feels right. Let's do it.

2519
02:04:44,990 --> 02:04:47,950
We start with a feint,
the wrong answer, frozen squid.

2520
02:04:48,030 --> 02:04:51,160
You'll be lookalikes at once
if he chooses this.

2521
02:04:52,530 --> 02:04:53,580
I've repeated many times.

2522
02:04:53,660 --> 02:04:56,660
Hobohobo Ika
hasn't been commercialised.

2523
02:04:56,740 --> 02:05:00,080
There's no way they can mistake it
for the real thing.

2524
02:05:00,160 --> 02:05:01,370
"C: correct"

2525
02:05:01,450 --> 02:05:03,740
Okay, do it.

2526
02:05:03,830 --> 02:05:05,700
I'm counting on you!
Choose B!

2527
02:05:05,780 --> 02:05:07,450
Not B!
Choose B.

2528
02:05:07,950 --> 02:05:10,870
Will he score the correct goal?

2529
02:05:12,240 --> 02:05:13,740
It's A.

2530
02:05:13,830 --> 02:05:15,410
Oh.
Oh.

2531
02:05:15,490 --> 02:05:16,870
"A: wrong"

2532
02:05:16,950 --> 02:05:18,990
What's wrong?
Mr Nakazawa!

2533
02:05:19,080 --> 02:05:21,200
He went for the tepid one.

2534
02:05:21,280 --> 02:05:23,530
We wish he'd just do it.

2535
02:05:23,620 --> 02:05:27,950
C was very chewy,

2536
02:05:29,410 --> 02:05:31,700
but I won't be deceived.

2537
02:05:31,780 --> 02:05:33,490
No...
They didn't deceive you.

2538
02:05:33,580 --> 02:05:36,240
But A should be just delicious.

2539
02:05:36,330 --> 02:05:38,080
A must be just delicious.

2540
02:05:38,780 --> 02:05:41,080
Okubo becomes a lookalike now.

2541
02:05:41,160 --> 02:05:42,410
I'll go in.

2542
02:05:43,490 --> 02:05:45,700
Oh, no one is here yet.

2543
02:05:45,780 --> 02:05:47,490
But I'm sure it's A.

2544
02:05:48,240 --> 02:05:49,950
It has to be A.

2545
02:05:50,700 --> 02:05:54,950
He is very confident,
but everything was halfbaked.

2546
02:05:56,200 --> 02:05:57,330
The next one is...

2547
02:05:57,410 --> 02:05:59,240
Thank you.
Miss Karina.

2548
02:05:59,330 --> 02:06:01,410
I'm counting on you.
She'll be okay.

2549
02:06:01,490 --> 02:06:02,370
I'll do my best.

2550
02:06:02,450 --> 02:06:04,490
Secondrated celebrity, Karina,

2551
02:06:04,580 --> 02:06:07,660
who has personally won
twice in a row today.

2552
02:06:07,740 --> 02:06:10,240
I got the imitation crab wrong.

2553
02:06:10,910 --> 02:06:13,410
Imitation crab is delicious!
It is.

2554
02:06:13,490 --> 02:06:17,080
So I'd like to try again.
That's right.

2555
02:06:17,530 --> 02:06:19,660
She chose HoboKani by mistake,

2556
02:06:19,740 --> 02:06:23,280
but she won't choose Hobohobo Ika
by mistake, too, right?

2557
02:06:23,990 --> 02:06:26,080
It's a revenge match this time.
Yes.

2558
02:06:26,490 --> 02:06:28,160
Choose Hobohobo Ika.

2559
02:06:29,830 --> 02:06:33,080
First, a bite of the wrong answer,
frozen squid.

2560
02:06:33,160 --> 02:06:34,780
"A: wrong"

2561
02:06:34,870 --> 02:06:37,620
You'll become thirdrated
if she chooses this.

2562
02:06:38,990 --> 02:06:43,080
This is the Hobohobo Ika
she mustn't choose.

2563
02:06:43,160 --> 02:06:44,950
"B: absolutely no"

2564
02:06:45,030 --> 02:06:46,030
What?

2565
02:06:46,120 --> 02:06:48,080
She likes imitation crab.

2566
02:06:48,160 --> 02:06:51,910
She's impressed and wowed.
I'm at risk, am I not?

2567
02:06:52,950 --> 02:06:56,120
She won't choose the Hobo Series
again, right?

2568
02:06:56,200 --> 02:06:58,030
You're eating the correct answer.

2569
02:06:58,120 --> 02:06:59,120
It's this one.

2570
02:06:59,200 --> 02:07:01,410
Choose this.
Expensive squid.

2571
02:07:02,080 --> 02:07:03,740
Okay.
Wow!

2572
02:07:03,830 --> 02:07:04,830
Surprisingly readily.

2573
02:07:04,910 --> 02:07:06,780
You never know.

2574
02:07:06,870 --> 02:07:08,120
Say B!

2575
02:07:08,200 --> 02:07:09,080
Choose B.

2576
02:07:09,160 --> 02:07:11,370
She'll say B.

2577
02:07:12,200 --> 02:07:14,490
Her answer is...

2578
02:07:17,200 --> 02:07:18,120
B.

2579
02:07:18,200 --> 02:07:19,950
What?

2580
02:07:19,990 --> 02:07:23,080
Are you kidding me?
Really?

2581
02:07:26,370 --> 02:07:28,240
She vanished!

2582
02:07:28,330 --> 02:07:30,370
Are you kidding me?
They vanished!

2583
02:07:30,450 --> 02:07:31,950
It's imitation crab!

2584
02:07:31,990 --> 02:07:35,330
Only B has an obvious sweetness.

2585
02:07:35,410 --> 02:07:39,280
The flavour also exploded in
my mouth after I ate it, so it's B.

2586
02:07:39,660 --> 02:07:42,450
Karina really can't do
the Hobo Series.

2587
02:07:42,530 --> 02:07:43,950
Yeah.

2588
02:07:44,030 --> 02:07:47,450
Her taste buds love the Hobo Series.

2589
02:07:47,530 --> 02:07:52,030
Replacing actress Karina, who is
enchanted by the Hobo Series...

2590
02:07:54,240 --> 02:07:58,280
Okazu Club's Okarina will play her.

2591
02:07:58,830 --> 02:08:05,580
"Karina is played
by Okazu Club's Okarina"

2592
02:08:05,660 --> 02:08:06,910
"B: absolutely no"

2593
02:08:06,950 --> 02:08:08,160
No one is here!

2594
02:08:08,240 --> 02:08:10,160
"Karina"

2595
02:08:10,240 --> 02:08:11,780
Are you kidding me?

2596
02:08:11,870 --> 02:08:13,080
Oh, Miss Karina.

2597
02:08:13,160 --> 02:08:13,990
Karina.

2598
02:08:14,080 --> 02:08:16,120
Ah! No way!

2599
02:08:16,200 --> 02:08:18,370
Yeah, we all chose differently.

2600
02:08:18,450 --> 02:08:21,660
But wasn't B sweet when you ate it?

2601
02:08:21,740 --> 02:08:24,030
It totally will be
commercialised now.

2602
02:08:24,120 --> 02:08:27,120
They've decided to sell it.
It's true.

2603
02:08:27,200 --> 02:08:29,410
It will be commercialised.

2604
02:08:29,490 --> 02:08:32,200
They should use Miss Karina
to advertise it.

2605
02:08:32,280 --> 02:08:33,830
It's delicious.
People will buy it.

2606
02:08:33,910 --> 02:08:34,950
"Karina"

2607
02:08:35,030 --> 02:08:37,740
Now, keep deceiving other people

2608
02:08:37,830 --> 02:08:40,370
and make the product a big hit!

2609
02:08:41,330 --> 02:08:43,160
Next...

2610
02:08:43,240 --> 02:08:44,870
Now, it's them!
They're here!

2611
02:08:44,950 --> 02:08:47,030
I see!
We're counting on you!

2612
02:08:47,120 --> 02:08:48,370
Get tricked by B!

2613
02:08:49,080 --> 02:08:52,280
Their opinions have agreed no matter
if it was right or wrong today,

2614
02:08:52,370 --> 02:08:53,990
Nogizawa46.

2615
02:08:54,080 --> 02:08:55,870
"Team Idols and Comedians"

2616
02:08:55,950 --> 02:08:56,950
Raise B together.

2617
02:08:57,030 --> 02:08:58,950
Will they disappear too?

2618
02:08:58,990 --> 02:09:01,700
Raise B.
At least have divided opinions.

2619
02:09:01,780 --> 02:09:03,830
They are united.
They said they were close.

2620
02:09:03,910 --> 02:09:05,870
Maybe their tastes are similar.

2621
02:09:06,660 --> 02:09:08,620
It feels so right.

2622
02:09:08,950 --> 02:09:10,030
No, it doesn't.

2623
02:09:10,120 --> 02:09:11,660
Look at this.

2624
02:09:11,740 --> 02:09:13,780
She's in a bit of a bad mood.

2625
02:09:14,240 --> 02:09:15,660
It feels right on them all.

2626
02:09:15,740 --> 02:09:16,950
Please!

2627
02:09:17,950 --> 02:09:20,740
Mr Akimoto, are you watching?

2628
02:09:20,830 --> 02:09:26,660
Nogizaka's members won't mistake
fish paste cake for squid, right?

2629
02:09:26,740 --> 02:09:27,950
Choose B.

2630
02:09:27,990 --> 02:09:29,490
Okay!
Not B.

2631
02:09:29,580 --> 02:09:31,330
Choose B at once.

2632
02:09:31,410 --> 02:09:32,580
Make a miracle.

2633
02:09:32,660 --> 02:09:33,530
No.

2634
02:09:33,620 --> 02:09:36,580
Don't all choose B. Please.

2635
02:09:37,370 --> 02:09:38,370
Choose B.

2636
02:09:38,450 --> 02:09:39,990
Okay!
Not B.

2637
02:09:40,080 --> 02:09:41,870
Choose B at once.
Don't.

2638
02:09:42,370 --> 02:09:44,580
Their answers are...

2639
02:09:46,160 --> 02:09:47,200
"Absolutely no"

2640
02:09:47,280 --> 02:09:49,740
We're different.
Oh no!

2641
02:09:49,830 --> 02:09:52,200
Hang on!

2642
02:09:52,280 --> 02:09:54,530
Yes!
Hang in there!

2643
02:09:54,620 --> 02:09:55,950
Miss Saito!

2644
02:09:56,030 --> 02:09:58,530
Hang in there!
Miss Saito!

2645
02:09:58,620 --> 02:09:59,950
Miss Saito!

2646
02:10:00,030 --> 02:10:01,200
It's B!

2647
02:10:01,280 --> 02:10:03,620
I couldn't choose between B and C,

2648
02:10:03,700 --> 02:10:06,990
but C tasted like the frozen thing
I usually order.

2649
02:10:07,080 --> 02:10:09,240
That's right.
Stop talking!

2650
02:10:09,330 --> 02:10:11,080
Don't say anything!

2651
02:10:11,160 --> 02:10:15,370
I think the texture of C
was the firmest,

2652
02:10:15,450 --> 02:10:17,410
so I thought it was frozen.

2653
02:10:17,490 --> 02:10:20,490
B tasted fresher than that.

2654
02:10:20,580 --> 02:10:22,490
That's Hobohobo Ika!

2655
02:10:22,580 --> 02:10:24,990
Senior! Miss Saito!
It's B!

2656
02:10:25,080 --> 02:10:26,990
Beat them up!
Beat them up, Miss Saito!

2657
02:10:28,870 --> 02:10:30,200
But you two chose B.

2658
02:10:30,280 --> 02:10:31,330
But you're our senior.

2659
02:10:31,410 --> 02:10:32,830
No, it's fine.

2660
02:10:32,910 --> 02:10:34,530
I can't take the responsibility.

2661
02:10:34,620 --> 02:10:36,950
We'll choose B.

2662
02:10:42,160 --> 02:10:43,280
Yes!

2663
02:10:44,030 --> 02:10:45,580
Yes!
No!

2664
02:10:45,660 --> 02:10:47,370
Just not that one!

2665
02:10:47,450 --> 02:10:50,080
Not that one!
Bye, Oideyasu Koga.

2666
02:10:50,160 --> 02:10:52,120
This is bad!

2667
02:10:52,200 --> 02:10:54,910
This is getting exciting.
Okay!

2668
02:10:54,950 --> 02:10:56,700
Senior, you can't do that!

2669
02:10:57,200 --> 02:10:59,030
Not this!

2670
02:10:59,660 --> 02:11:03,030
Replacing the vanished idols
we can't meet,

2671
02:11:04,280 --> 02:11:06,990
Zakoshizaka46 will play them.

2672
02:11:07,080 --> 02:11:11,700
"Hollywood Zakoshisyoh
plays them exaggeratedly"

2673
02:11:11,780 --> 02:11:15,080
"Yamashita, Saito, Yoda"

2674
02:11:15,160 --> 02:11:16,120
I'm scared.

2675
02:11:16,200 --> 02:11:18,580
"Karina"

2676
02:11:18,660 --> 02:11:19,990
Miss Karina is here!

2677
02:11:20,080 --> 02:11:21,160
"Saito, Yoda"

2678
02:11:21,240 --> 02:11:22,950
Come here.

2679
02:11:23,030 --> 02:11:24,870
Come here... Thank goodness.

2680
02:11:24,950 --> 02:11:26,240
I'm happy!

2681
02:11:26,330 --> 02:11:27,950
I feel a bit relieved.
But everyone is different.

2682
02:11:28,450 --> 02:11:30,660
Wow, really!
Yeah.

2683
02:11:30,740 --> 02:11:33,160
It's hard to say.

2684
02:11:33,830 --> 02:11:35,740
Two teams vanished in a row.

2685
02:11:35,830 --> 02:11:36,830
Among the drama,

2686
02:11:36,910 --> 02:11:41,780
common celebrity, Mr Jesse, who may
be back to firstrated, is next.

2687
02:11:41,870 --> 02:11:45,700
But now it's better to choose
either C or B.

2688
02:11:45,780 --> 02:11:49,080
Rather than the halfbaked A.
That's right.

2689
02:11:49,620 --> 02:11:50,910
First, it's A,

2690
02:11:50,950 --> 02:11:54,580
that puts them one rank down
and very halfbaked on TV.

2691
02:11:54,660 --> 02:11:55,780
"A: wrong"

2692
02:11:55,870 --> 02:11:57,950
He's laughing.

2693
02:11:58,030 --> 02:11:59,580
Wow, delicious!

2694
02:11:59,660 --> 02:12:02,660
Right? It's delicious,
even if it's frozen.

2695
02:12:03,120 --> 02:12:06,580
Next, Hobohobo Ika,
which makes him vanish at once.

2696
02:12:07,120 --> 02:12:08,120
What?

2697
02:12:08,200 --> 02:12:11,080
That's right. Jesse,
your reaction is correct!

2698
02:12:11,160 --> 02:12:12,120
Yes!

2699
02:12:12,200 --> 02:12:15,030
It is what you taste first.

2700
02:12:15,580 --> 02:12:17,530
It's delicious!

2701
02:12:18,830 --> 02:12:20,910
I'm scared!
That one just now is bad!

2702
02:12:20,950 --> 02:12:23,580
That "delicious" just now was bad!
This is bad.

2703
02:12:23,660 --> 02:12:24,700
This is bad.

2704
02:12:24,780 --> 02:12:27,660
That's the "delicious" he says
when he eats something delicious.

2705
02:12:27,740 --> 02:12:29,120
This is bad!

2706
02:12:29,740 --> 02:12:31,330
Yeah, they're all delicious.

2707
02:12:31,410 --> 02:12:32,740
"Saito, Karina, Yoda, Yamashita"

2708
02:12:32,830 --> 02:12:35,620
Then, the correct answer,
expensive squid, which lets him

2709
02:12:35,700 --> 02:12:37,450
return to firstrated
if he chooses it.

2710
02:12:37,530 --> 02:12:39,160
Firstrated or vanish.

2711
02:12:39,240 --> 02:12:40,660
Please, Jesse, let's be firstrated.

2712
02:12:40,740 --> 02:12:42,080
They're clearly different?

2713
02:12:43,580 --> 02:12:45,030
What will happen now?

2714
02:12:45,120 --> 02:12:46,030
Please!

2715
02:12:46,120 --> 02:12:49,280
C or B? C or B?

2716
02:12:49,370 --> 02:12:51,160
Say B!
Firstrated!

2717
02:12:51,240 --> 02:12:52,660
Come here.

2718
02:12:53,330 --> 02:12:55,910
His answer is...

2719
02:12:55,950 --> 02:12:56,990
I'll choose.

2720
02:12:58,160 --> 02:12:59,740
A!

2721
02:12:59,830 --> 02:13:01,620
What?
A!

2722
02:13:01,700 --> 02:13:03,490
Hey!
Not interesting at all!

2723
02:13:03,580 --> 02:13:05,240
Go all the way wrong!

2724
02:13:05,330 --> 02:13:07,410
Not funny at all.

2725
02:13:07,490 --> 02:13:08,700
Whoa...

2726
02:13:08,780 --> 02:13:11,580
A is the worst choice.
What the heck?

2727
02:13:11,660 --> 02:13:14,030
It's the most balanced one.

2728
02:13:14,120 --> 02:13:16,830
It was neither soft nor hard,

2729
02:13:17,370 --> 02:13:18,870
how about that?

2730
02:13:18,950 --> 02:13:19,990
Look at this guy.

2731
02:13:20,490 --> 02:13:21,870
He's not funny at all.

2732
02:13:25,950 --> 02:13:27,990
Jesse caused an incident
in every sense

2733
02:13:28,080 --> 02:13:31,200
and falls to secondrated celebrity.

2734
02:13:31,950 --> 02:13:33,830
"A: wrong"

2735
02:13:33,910 --> 02:13:35,490
Mr Okubo.

2736
02:13:35,580 --> 02:13:38,120
Oh, thank goodness!
I feel really relieved.

2737
02:13:38,200 --> 02:13:40,490
Really? Are you kidding me?

2738
02:13:40,580 --> 02:13:42,240
Wow.
It's A?

2739
02:13:42,330 --> 02:13:43,450
What...?

2740
02:13:43,530 --> 02:13:46,410
Well, now it all depends
on Miss Koshiba.

2741
02:13:46,490 --> 02:13:49,200
That's right. We'll see if you can
become firstrated.

2742
02:13:49,280 --> 02:13:52,490
We hope she can really make it.

2743
02:13:52,580 --> 02:13:54,330
We definitely want her to.

2744
02:13:54,950 --> 02:13:57,370
The last one is...

2745
02:13:57,450 --> 02:13:59,530
Miss Koshiba, we're counting on you!

2746
02:13:59,950 --> 02:14:01,450
It depends on her now.

2747
02:14:02,160 --> 02:14:05,910
It also depends on
common celebrity Miss Fuka Koshiba

2748
02:14:05,950 --> 02:14:08,580
to bring them back to firstrated.

2749
02:14:08,660 --> 02:14:11,490
Let's return to firstrated
glamorously.

2750
02:14:11,580 --> 02:14:13,160
C will bring them
back to firstrated.

2751
02:14:14,580 --> 02:14:19,080
First, the halfbaked one rank down,
frozen squid.

2752
02:14:19,160 --> 02:14:21,450
I think she'll think it's delicious.

2753
02:14:21,530 --> 02:14:23,870
The girl came from
the Kansai region.

2754
02:14:23,950 --> 02:14:25,330
Everything is delicious.

2755
02:14:29,240 --> 02:14:32,830
Next, it's fish paste,
and not squid.

2756
02:14:32,910 --> 02:14:34,330
"B: absolutely no"

2757
02:14:34,410 --> 02:14:35,950
Oh, girls like it.

2758
02:14:37,200 --> 02:14:38,950
No, Fuka.

2759
02:14:39,030 --> 02:14:41,280
Well, Karina chose it.

2760
02:14:41,370 --> 02:14:43,280
Both Karina and Nogizaka chose it.

2761
02:14:43,370 --> 02:14:45,990
All the beautiful ladies.
No, not this...

2762
02:14:46,080 --> 02:14:47,530
"Hobo Karina"

2763
02:14:48,240 --> 02:14:50,330
And the correct answer, C.

2764
02:14:50,410 --> 02:14:53,240
You only need to choose this.

2765
02:14:53,330 --> 02:14:56,620
I hope she'll return
to firstrated, though!

2766
02:14:57,950 --> 02:14:59,330
Okay!

2767
02:14:59,410 --> 02:15:00,830
She can't decide.

2768
02:15:00,910 --> 02:15:02,660
I'm so nervous!
Now...

2769
02:15:03,450 --> 02:15:06,450
I'm so nervous!
Now...

2770
02:15:06,530 --> 02:15:08,030
Just don't say A.

2771
02:15:08,120 --> 02:15:09,700
C or B.

2772
02:15:09,780 --> 02:15:11,700
A is the most boring.

2773
02:15:11,780 --> 02:15:14,830
Don't say it's boring.
Directly.

2774
02:15:14,910 --> 02:15:16,660
It's C. It's C.

2775
02:15:17,700 --> 02:15:19,990
Her answer is...

2776
02:15:20,080 --> 02:15:22,030
C or B. C or B.

2777
02:15:22,120 --> 02:15:22,950
"A: wrong"

2778
02:15:23,030 --> 02:15:24,740
What...?

2779
02:15:24,830 --> 02:15:27,370
Are you kidding me?

2780
02:15:27,450 --> 02:15:31,240
I think the taste of B
was the richest.

2781
02:15:31,330 --> 02:15:32,330
Oh!

2782
02:15:32,910 --> 02:15:37,490
C was also rather chewy.

2783
02:15:37,580 --> 02:15:42,990
I think frozen squid
is rather chewy,

2784
02:15:43,080 --> 02:15:46,330
so I chose A by elimination.

2785
02:15:46,410 --> 02:15:50,910
The last common celebrity we had
high hopes for was the most boring.

2786
02:15:50,950 --> 02:15:52,450
It was boring.

2787
02:15:52,530 --> 02:15:54,580
She was serious...

2788
02:15:54,660 --> 02:15:56,910
Yeah, it can't be helped.
Well...

2789
02:15:56,950 --> 02:15:58,200
"Halfbaked secondrated"

2790
02:15:58,280 --> 02:16:02,620
In the end, she goes down to
the most boring secondrated.

2791
02:16:02,700 --> 02:16:05,120
Hey, welcome.

2792
02:16:05,200 --> 02:16:07,620
I worried nobody would be here!
Welcome!

2793
02:16:07,700 --> 02:16:10,160
We're both common, right?
That's right.

2794
02:16:10,240 --> 02:16:13,240
Thank goodness someone is here!

2795
02:16:13,330 --> 02:16:15,740
Jesse, you think C is frozen, right?

2796
02:16:15,830 --> 02:16:16,830
Yes.

2797
02:16:16,910 --> 02:16:18,120
Karina, you too?

2798
02:16:18,200 --> 02:16:22,280
Well, I thought C tasted like
frozen squid.

2799
02:16:22,370 --> 02:16:24,870
Which one was fish paste,
Miss Karina? C?

2800
02:16:25,330 --> 02:16:29,080
I think Hobohobo Ika is A.

2801
02:16:29,160 --> 02:16:30,910
It's your room.

2802
02:16:31,660 --> 02:16:33,370
This conversation is funny!

2803
02:16:33,450 --> 02:16:35,120
I want to keep listening to it.

2804
02:16:35,200 --> 02:16:36,950
"Saito, Karina, Yoda, Yamashita"

2805
02:16:37,490 --> 02:16:40,830
The fateful announcement
of the result!

2806
02:16:41,740 --> 02:16:43,700
I want to get the last one right.

2807
02:16:44,030 --> 02:16:45,830
End with a correct answer.

2808
02:16:45,910 --> 02:16:47,530
They've already vanished,

2809
02:16:47,620 --> 02:16:51,530
but please enjoy the nervous looks
on their own faces.

2810
02:16:52,910 --> 02:16:55,620
Here I am!

2811
02:16:56,330 --> 02:16:57,740
Please!

2812
02:16:57,830 --> 02:17:02,240
I'll open the door of
the correct answer's room, but...

2813
02:17:02,660 --> 02:17:07,330
I'll first open the door of the room
that makes you go down one rank.

2814
02:17:07,410 --> 02:17:09,450
Go down one rank?

2815
02:17:09,530 --> 02:17:10,700
I see.
I see...

2816
02:17:10,780 --> 02:17:12,240
It's C, right?

2817
02:17:12,330 --> 02:17:14,990
Don't open it...

2818
02:17:15,080 --> 02:17:16,490
No!

2819
02:17:21,280 --> 02:17:24,240
It's C, right?
I think it's C.

2820
02:17:24,330 --> 02:17:25,660
"B: absolutely no"

2821
02:17:25,740 --> 02:17:27,740
Don't come here.
I'm scared.

2822
02:17:27,830 --> 02:17:29,990
"C: correct"

2823
02:17:30,080 --> 02:17:33,950
The room that makes you
go down one rank is...

2824
02:17:36,080 --> 02:17:37,660
Oh!
Please leave.

2825
02:17:37,740 --> 02:17:40,580
No way!
You aren't interesting at all.

2826
02:17:41,200 --> 02:17:42,200
What?

2827
02:17:42,280 --> 02:17:43,990
"A: wrong"

2828
02:17:44,080 --> 02:17:45,740
Oh!
Please leave.

2829
02:17:45,830 --> 02:17:46,700
No way!

2830
02:17:46,780 --> 02:17:48,660
You aren't interesting at all.

2831
02:17:49,200 --> 02:17:50,120
What?

2832
02:17:50,200 --> 02:17:52,280
This is the room
you go down one rank.

2833
02:17:52,370 --> 02:17:53,450
Frozen?

2834
02:17:53,530 --> 02:17:56,660
This is frozen?
It's frozen?

2835
02:17:56,740 --> 02:17:58,080
What?

2836
02:17:59,240 --> 02:18:01,080
A is one rank down?

2837
02:18:01,160 --> 02:18:04,120
Thank goodness!
I'm scared...

2838
02:18:04,200 --> 02:18:05,660
It's either one, right?

2839
02:18:05,740 --> 02:18:06,780
No way!

2840
02:18:06,870 --> 02:18:11,660
We're either correct or we vanish.
Two ranks?

2841
02:18:11,740 --> 02:18:14,530
I'll open the door
of the correct answer's room.

2842
02:18:14,620 --> 02:18:15,580
No...

2843
02:18:15,660 --> 02:18:18,950
If I don't open your door,
you'll vanish!

2844
02:18:19,030 --> 02:18:20,200
Let's do it!

2845
02:18:20,870 --> 02:18:23,450
Let's vanish.
Yeah.

2846
02:18:24,490 --> 02:18:26,740
The correct answer is...

2847
02:18:26,830 --> 02:18:27,740
Voom!

2848
02:18:27,830 --> 02:18:28,910
"C: correct"

2849
02:18:28,950 --> 02:18:32,080
"B: absolutely no"

2850
02:18:33,950 --> 02:18:35,990
Congratulations!
Wow!

2851
02:18:36,080 --> 02:18:37,030
Really?

2852
02:18:37,120 --> 02:18:38,370
Really?

2853
02:18:38,450 --> 02:18:40,370
Hamachan, I finally see you!

2854
02:18:41,280 --> 02:18:43,330
Congratulations!
Wow!

2855
02:18:43,410 --> 02:18:45,620
Really? Really?

2856
02:18:45,700 --> 02:18:48,160
Hamachan, I finally see you!

2857
02:18:51,950 --> 02:18:53,660
"Saito, Karina, Yoda, Yamashita"

2858
02:18:53,740 --> 02:18:56,080
Oh!

2859
02:18:56,160 --> 02:18:58,660
Oh!

2860
02:18:58,740 --> 02:18:59,740
I already gave up.

2861
02:18:59,830 --> 02:19:03,030
It smells like old people here.

2862
02:19:03,120 --> 02:19:03,950
Yeah.

2863
02:19:04,030 --> 02:19:06,080
Old people smell
is in the atmosphere.

2864
02:19:06,160 --> 02:19:08,530
Everyone in B has vanished now.

2865
02:19:08,620 --> 02:19:10,830
They've vanished?
We've vanished!

2866
02:19:10,910 --> 02:19:13,030
Ryuta, I'm sorry!

2867
02:19:13,450 --> 02:19:15,370
But it was delicious!

2868
02:19:15,450 --> 02:19:17,620
It was delicious.

2869
02:19:17,700 --> 02:19:19,120
Big drama!

2870
02:19:19,200 --> 02:19:20,410
Spring storm raged,

2871
02:19:20,490 --> 02:19:22,620
every team is secondrate or below,
not to mention firstrated.

2872
02:19:22,700 --> 02:19:23,830
It's not fun!

2873
02:19:23,910 --> 02:19:28,370
Okay, all the tests have been done,
let's have a look at the result.

2874
02:19:28,450 --> 02:19:31,450
Two teams
of secondrated celebrities.

2875
02:19:31,530 --> 02:19:35,160
Thank you.
One team of thirdrated celebs.

2876
02:19:35,240 --> 02:19:37,780
Two teams of lookalikes.
Yes!

2877
02:19:37,870 --> 02:19:40,410
And... not here!

2878
02:19:40,490 --> 02:19:41,490
Not here!

2879
02:19:41,580 --> 02:19:43,780
It's cleaner now.

2880
02:19:43,870 --> 02:19:46,200
No common
and firstrated celebrities.

2881
02:19:46,280 --> 02:19:47,990
What's wrong with this episode?

2882
02:19:49,660 --> 02:19:52,620
This team didn't look like
they would disappear.

2883
02:19:52,700 --> 02:19:54,280
No.
Indeed.

2884
02:19:54,370 --> 02:19:58,030
Miss Karina, what... what the heck?

2885
02:19:58,660 --> 02:20:01,950
The Hobo Series suits my taste buds.

2886
02:20:02,660 --> 02:20:04,030
I'm amazed.
It was delicious.

2887
02:20:04,120 --> 02:20:06,120
They are all delicious.

2888
02:20:06,200 --> 02:20:07,660
Nogizaka too.

2889
02:20:07,740 --> 02:20:09,580
What was that?

2890
02:20:09,660 --> 02:20:14,280
I think Miss Yamashita and Miss Yoda
should listen to other people.

2891
02:20:14,950 --> 02:20:16,990
I'm sorry!

2892
02:20:17,780 --> 02:20:23,700
But you were saved once, came back,
got one right, and passed the baton.

2893
02:20:23,780 --> 02:20:26,240
I passed him the baton,
and he successfully got it right.

2894
02:20:26,330 --> 02:20:27,910
You stay here as lookalikes.

2895
02:20:27,950 --> 02:20:29,910
I think we'd win
if there were six more tests.

2896
02:20:29,950 --> 02:20:32,990
No, we would be exhausted.
It's too long.

2897
02:20:33,080 --> 02:20:36,870
Don't vanish this time
in the MiniGrading.

2898
02:20:37,280 --> 02:20:39,280
First, red wine.

2899
02:20:39,370 --> 02:20:41,120
The correct answer is...

2900
02:20:41,200 --> 02:20:42,490
No way!

2901
02:20:44,870 --> 02:20:46,240
I...

2902
02:20:47,030 --> 02:20:49,950
Next, a string quartet performance.

2903
02:20:50,030 --> 02:20:52,080
They sound the same.
Yeah.

2904
02:20:52,160 --> 02:20:53,950
The correct answer is...

2905
02:20:57,580 --> 02:20:59,450
Wait...

2906
02:21:01,870 --> 02:21:04,620
And the hamburger steak
with testicles mixed.

2907
02:21:04,700 --> 02:21:06,580
The correct answer is...

2908
02:21:06,660 --> 02:21:08,280
Yes!
Wow!

2909
02:21:11,450 --> 02:21:13,330
Beatboxing.

2910
02:21:14,080 --> 02:21:15,700
The correct answer is...

2911
02:21:15,780 --> 02:21:17,660
Yay!
Yes!

2912
02:21:17,740 --> 02:21:19,950
I'm so happy.
See?

2913
02:21:20,030 --> 02:21:23,330
Can they stay as secondrated?
It's coloured carp.

2914
02:21:24,240 --> 02:21:25,240
We're different.

2915
02:21:25,330 --> 02:21:27,490
The fins are strong,

2916
02:21:27,580 --> 02:21:30,490
if they look weak...
No, it's the pattern.

2917
02:21:30,580 --> 02:21:32,370
The correct answer is...

2918
02:21:32,450 --> 02:21:33,910
Yes!

2919
02:21:35,490 --> 02:21:37,240
It matters.
Right?

2920
02:21:37,910 --> 02:21:41,830
Last one, deepfried squid.
You'll vanish at once if you say B!

2921
02:21:43,200 --> 02:21:45,240
Their answers are...

2922
02:21:45,740 --> 02:21:46,830
Yay!

2923
02:21:46,910 --> 02:21:48,160
Oh, he vanished!

2924
02:21:48,240 --> 02:21:50,080
You vanished! You vanished!

2925
02:21:50,160 --> 02:21:53,080
It shows the bad parts of me.
