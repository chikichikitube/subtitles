1
00:00:00,600 --> 00:00:03,500
- Let's start something fun.
- Yeah.

2
00:00:03,870 --> 00:00:05,570
We were told by them to do a manzai.

3
00:00:05,730 --> 00:00:08,640
- So we do a half hour manzai.
- That sounds like it.

4
00:00:09,000 --> 00:00:11,810
Hey, man.

5
00:00:12,210 --> 00:00:14,780
- Manzai is usually  about 15 minutes, right?
- Yeah.

6
00:00:14,880 --> 00:00:20,880
We have to do it for 30 minutes.
Sounds fun, doesn't it?
You're also excited, aren't you?

7
00:00:20,880 --> 00:00:27,120
Well, when I'm done, I'm going to line up the staff and beat them up one by one.

8
00:00:28,120 --> 00:00:33,260
That's fine, but this time we're going to be able to do our manzai to the hilt.

9
00:00:33,600 --> 00:00:36,530
- Yeah, that's good.
- It doesn't seem like you want to do it

10
00:00:36,630 --> 00:00:41,200
We don't get to do manzai in Tokyo very often.

11
00:00:41,670 --> 00:00:47,010
- So today we'll see how it goes.
- I wonder what will happen.

12
00:00:47,340 --> 00:00:49,280
- Oh, they are looking for students.
- Let's join.

13
00:00:50,510 --> 00:00:54,450
Downtown no
Gaki no tsukai ya arahende!!
#0001

14
00:01:19,710 --> 00:01:23,240
Sorry for walking in so sloppily, even though we' re young.
But it's tough.

15
00:01:23,240 --> 00:01:25,850
Even young people have tough times.

16
00:01:25,850 --> 00:01:34,520
- I can't move the way I want. I know it's the first shot, so I'll do my best, but my joints hurt.
- What the hell.

17
00:01:34,520 --> 00:01:39,230
- It's been a long time since I've done a manzai.
I miss it.
- Yeah.

18
00:01:39,230 --> 00:01:44,300
- People in Tokyo don't know us.
- Of course they don't, because we haven't been to any shows in Tokyo.

19
00:01:44,300 --> 00:01:51,940
- Many people don't know which agency we belong to.
We belong to Yoshimoto Kogyo.
- Do you know Yoshimoto Kogyo?

20
00:01:51,940 --> 00:01:54,480
it's well-known among the public.

21
00:01:54,480 --> 00:01:59,580
- It’s known for its low remuneration and for making us work like slaves.
- That's right.

22
00:01:59,580 --> 00:02:06,750
We can do this calmly in these places, but it's difficult to do it at Namba Grand kagetsu.

23
00:02:07,090 --> 00:02:11,130
- Because the bigwigs from Yoshimoto come to see us.
- They come to see us while we are doing manzai.

24
00:02:11,130 --> 00:02:14,030
The bigwigs from the head office come to the back of the seats.

25
00:02:14,030 --> 00:02:18,530
- If I say "the bigwigs from Yoshimoto," it's too long, so I say "yakuza".
- Hey!

26
00:02:19,330 --> 00:02:22,000
They are not yakuza.
They look like them, though.

27
00:02:22,000 --> 00:02:25,640
- Sometimes the chairman comes to see the show.
- Do you know the chairman of Yoshimoto?

28
00:02:25,670 --> 00:02:28,540
He is an old coot named Shonosuke Hayashi.

29
00:02:29,280 --> 00:02:33,150
He has gray hair and a cane.
He doesn't need it because he is in good health.

30
00:02:33,150 --> 00:02:35,750
- He has a cane because he wants to poke comedians with it.
- Don't lie!

31
00:02:36,420 --> 00:02:38,890
- "I want to poke them," he often says.
- Don't be silly.

32
00:02:38,890 --> 00:02:44,460
Sometimes guys like that come to see us.
So it's difficult to do that.

33
00:02:44,460 --> 00:02:47,030
- He looks at us on stage with a furrowed brow.
- He never laughs.

34
00:02:47,030 --> 00:02:50,970
That's right.
He sees us with this looks on his face.
He doesn't know much about us.

35
00:02:52,230 --> 00:02:54,700
- Even though we are Yoshimoto.
- He doesn't know us because there are so many comedians.

36
00:02:54,700 --> 00:02:58,940
- He called someone.
- While we are doing our manzai.

37
00:02:59,210 --> 00:03:00,070
"Who is that?"

38
00:03:00,740 --> 00:03:02,310
"Who is that on stage right now?"

39
00:03:02,680 --> 00:03:04,450
"They're Downtown."

40
00:03:04,550 --> 00:03:05,980
- "Delete them."
- Don't lie!

41
00:03:07,420 --> 00:03:10,650
No matter how bad he is, he won't say that.

42
00:03:10,650 --> 00:03:14,460
- He says a lot of irresponsible things.
- He doesn't even think of us as humans.

43
00:03:14,690 --> 00:03:16,220
He says a lot of irresponsible things.

44
00:03:16,490 --> 00:03:22,300
The other day I met some bigwigs and I said, "Thank you for everything".

45
00:03:22,360 --> 00:03:26,100
- He said to me, "I still don't know what you said".
- That's too bad.

46
00:03:26,100 --> 00:03:27,940
It seems I'm not very smooth.

47
00:03:27,940 --> 00:03:32,440
Sometimes I can't understand what I'm saying.
I know that, but I can't help it.

48
00:03:32,440 --> 00:03:34,780
Even when I'm speaking now, you can't see my upper teeth.

49
00:03:35,010 --> 00:03:36,780
My upper lip is long.

50
00:03:36,780 --> 00:03:38,650
- It's a disease.
- Yes.

51
00:03:38,650 --> 00:03:42,250
I'm trying my best to speak forward, but my voice hits back here.

52
00:03:42,250 --> 00:03:46,250
He tries to speak, but his voice hits here and it doesn't come out.

53
00:03:46,250 --> 00:03:49,790
- I explained it to him.
Then he said, "Cut around the mouth."
- Don't lie!

54
00:03:51,460 --> 00:03:54,830
If you cut there, I'll see your gums and it'll be disgusting.

55
00:03:55,360 --> 00:04:01,770
I thought I had to do that, so I talked to mom about it.

56
00:04:01,770 --> 00:04:04,040
Did you?

57
00:04:04,040 --> 00:04:07,510
Mom also agonized over it for about three days and said, "If you want to do it, then do it".

58
00:04:09,010 --> 00:04:10,010
Really?

59
00:04:10,010 --> 00:04:13,180
- So I went to the hospital and they drew just a cut line here.
- Where is it drawn?

60
00:04:15,350 --> 00:04:20,360
I became a comedian to make money.
But I can't make much money at Yoshimoto.

61
00:04:20,360 --> 00:04:22,460
Hey, what are you talking about?

62
00:04:22,460 --> 00:04:25,030
- I think we are going the wrong way.
- Maybe so.

63
00:04:25,130 --> 00:04:27,330
There were several professions I wanted to be when I was a student.

64
00:04:27,330 --> 00:04:30,200
Many people want to be athletes.

65
00:04:30,700 --> 00:04:35,100
Pilots, doctors...
I wanted to be a school teacher.

66
00:04:35,740 --> 00:04:41,010
I liked the teachers in TV dramas who worked hard with their students.

67
00:04:41,010 --> 00:04:47,950
There are usually pros and cons.
There are good teachers and bad teachers.
A teacher with a bad personality.

68
00:04:47,950 --> 00:04:52,890
My gym teacher in high school was like that.
I hated him.
He would not admit his mistakes.

69
00:04:53,390 --> 00:04:56,060
- He never tried to fix them?
- Yeah.

70
00:04:56,160 --> 00:05:01,700
"Everyone, today you will have a bar test.
First, I'll show you how to do it.
Do it just like I did."

71
00:05:02,160 --> 00:05:04,130
We watched him.

72
00:05:04,130 --> 00:05:09,200
While rolling on the bar,  the teacher fell to the ground and cracked his head open.

73
00:05:09,700 --> 00:05:11,040
His brain came out.

74
00:05:12,710 --> 00:05:13,880
"Are you okay!?"

75
00:05:14,540 --> 00:05:15,880
The teacher stood up and said.
"Do this."

76
00:05:15,880 --> 00:05:17,510
There is no way he would say that!!

77
00:05:18,150 --> 00:05:20,550
- Everyone's brain was out by the fifth period.
- Stop it already!

78
00:05:20,550 --> 00:05:23,480
You don't have to say that much.

79
00:05:23,850 --> 00:05:26,020
How can there be a teacher like that?

80
00:05:26,020 --> 00:05:28,060
I always wanted to be a doctor.

81
00:05:28,490 --> 00:05:38,570
It's good to be a doctor, but they have to think about their patients.
Suppose your child gets sick and you take him to a doctor.
It's hard for the parents.

82
00:05:39,530 --> 00:05:43,140
"Doctor, how is my son?"

83
00:05:44,140 --> 00:05:46,470
Is Masao going to be all right?

84
00:05:46,810 --> 00:05:48,910
- Are you Masao-kun's father?
- Yes.

85
00:05:49,480 --> 00:05:51,580
Come to think of it, you and he have similar eyes.

86
00:05:53,550 --> 00:05:54,550
Yes...

87
00:05:54,550 --> 00:05:57,120
His mouth looks like your wife's.

88
00:05:57,690 --> 00:05:58,550
Is that so?

89
00:05:58,690 --> 00:06:00,090
He does that move a lot.

90
00:06:00,090 --> 00:06:01,560
Shut up!

91
00:06:03,660 --> 00:06:08,230
I took his X-rays the other day.

92
00:06:08,960 --> 00:06:10,130
Yes.

93
00:06:10,130 --> 00:06:11,930
I got the copies.

94
00:06:12,870 --> 00:06:17,840
There are about eight of them, so I put them up in the hallway.
Let me know if there is a photo number you want.

95
00:06:18,510 --> 00:06:20,070
I'll let you know if there's one I want.

96
00:06:20,310 --> 00:06:21,280
Let's look at one of them.

97
00:06:21,610 --> 00:06:22,980
Here it is.

98
00:06:22,980 --> 00:06:26,150
This is Masao-kun taken from a meteorological satellite.

99
00:06:26,750 --> 00:06:29,050
- You took this picture of him from a distance.
- Yes, I have a good shot of him.

100
00:06:29,350 --> 00:06:31,620
This will be difficult to understand without explanation.

101
00:06:31,990 --> 00:06:35,160
I don't have the knowledge, so please tell me simply.

102
00:06:35,160 --> 00:06:37,390
I understand. Let me put it simply.

103
00:06:38,190 --> 00:06:39,590
He has a problem with his lungs.

104
00:06:39,930 --> 00:06:44,470
His lungs are like "baaaang".
And his gut is like "baaang".

105
00:06:45,330 --> 00:06:49,570
Wish it could have been like "bang" here, but it's more like "bang" here than I thought it would be.

106
00:06:49,570 --> 00:06:52,810
That's why I was talking with everyone earlier about how I wish here was like "bang".

107
00:06:53,340 --> 00:06:54,980
- Thank you.
- How am I supposed to understand that!?

108
00:06:56,380 --> 00:06:59,450
Anyone can explain it like that.

109
00:07:00,820 --> 00:07:03,280
What the hell is "baang", you bastard?

110
00:07:03,350 --> 00:07:03,920
Yes?

111
00:07:05,450 --> 00:07:07,420
- Please be serious!
- I understand.

112
00:07:07,620 --> 00:07:09,290
This is about my son.

113
00:07:09,290 --> 00:07:11,060
It‘s really serious.

114
00:07:11,360 --> 00:07:14,000
Masao-kun has cancer.

115
00:07:15,000 --> 00:07:16,160
It's funny, isn't it?

116
00:07:17,700 --> 00:07:19,970
Doctor, please be serious.

117
00:07:20,200 --> 00:07:22,700
Now I was taken by surprise by you.

118
00:07:23,000 --> 00:07:25,410
Masao-kun has cancer.
There are various kinds of cancer.

119
00:07:25,640 --> 00:07:27,510
His cancer is malignant.

120
00:07:28,240 --> 00:07:31,480
In medical terms, it's a "really bad cancer".

121
00:07:32,310 --> 00:07:36,850
I cannot guarantee his life.
He has six months to live and he will die as early as the second Saturday at 2:00.

122
00:07:40,660 --> 00:07:43,460
Doctor, can't you do something?

123
00:07:46,860 --> 00:07:47,930
Please do something about it.

124
00:07:47,930 --> 00:07:48,700
No.

125
00:07:50,000 --> 00:07:52,900
Don't say like that.

126
00:07:53,270 --> 00:07:54,600
Please do something about it.

127
00:07:55,070 --> 00:07:57,470
There is nothing I can do either.

128
00:07:57,510 --> 00:08:00,610
You must never tell him that he has cancer.

129
00:08:00,740 --> 00:08:02,280
- Is that the only way?
- Yes.

130
00:08:03,280 --> 00:08:04,480
I'm sorry for your loss.

131
00:08:06,350 --> 00:08:08,650
Masao, wait over there.

132
00:08:08,880 --> 00:08:10,890
I'm having an important talk with him right now.

133
00:08:10,890 --> 00:08:12,350
Doctor, please say something to him.

134
00:08:12,350 --> 00:08:15,290
Masao-kun, don't listen to this conversation.

135
00:08:15,390 --> 00:08:17,590
Can you wait outside?

136
00:08:17,790 --> 00:08:19,590
You're a cancer patient, don't move so much.

137
00:08:21,430 --> 00:08:23,800
You're going to die anyway!
If you move so much, your cancer will get even worse.

138
00:08:24,000 --> 00:08:25,300
You are hateful.

139
00:08:26,070 --> 00:08:27,340
Please don't let him find out about that.

140
00:08:27,340 --> 00:08:28,670
Shut up!

141
00:08:29,540 --> 00:08:32,970
You're the one who told me not to let him find out!

142
00:08:33,570 --> 00:08:34,480
Hey!

143
00:08:35,380 --> 00:08:36,280
Hey!

144
00:08:36,780 --> 00:08:39,080
Quiz shows these days are fun, aren't they?

145
00:08:41,480 --> 00:08:43,050
Don't change the subject!!

146
00:08:44,550 --> 00:08:49,220
You told me not to mention this, and I told him to go over there.
What do you mean, "quiz shows are fun"?

147
00:08:49,220 --> 00:08:52,060
Quiz shows these days are fun.

148
00:08:52,630 --> 00:08:54,130
it's fun, though!

149
00:08:56,660 --> 00:08:59,030
- Are you fucking kidding me?
- There are so many quiz shows these days.

150
00:08:59,230 --> 00:09:07,580
In one show, if you answer 10 questions correctly, you get a prize of one million yen and a travel to Hawaii.

151
00:09:07,880 --> 00:09:14,420
You can make more money by participating in quiz shows than by working.
But it's hard to get the right answers.

152
00:09:15,020 --> 00:09:18,350
So let's do a quiz today.

153
00:09:18,620 --> 00:09:20,790
I'll give you the questions and you answer them.

154
00:09:21,490 --> 00:09:23,490
I just told you.

155
00:09:23,760 --> 00:09:29,200
If you answer the quiz correctly, you get one million yen in prize money.
Plus a travel to Hawaii.

156
00:09:29,930 --> 00:09:37,000
I don't want that much in return, but I would like something in return.
Please consider my feelings.

157
00:09:37,370 --> 00:09:42,140
- If you get the answer right, I'll switch from tomorrow between being the "boke" and the "tsukkomi" with you.
- I don't want to do that!

158
00:09:42,340 --> 00:09:47,010
I don't want a million yen or a travel to Hawaii, but I do want a reward.

159
00:09:47,580 --> 00:09:48,880
Philippines.

160
00:09:50,890 --> 00:09:53,290
So if I get it right, I can go on a travel to the Philippines?

161
00:09:53,290 --> 00:09:55,620
No, but tomorrow you'll be a Filipino.

162
00:09:55,620 --> 00:09:58,360
- I don't want to be!
- You'll move your residency to the Philippines.

163
00:09:58,360 --> 00:10:00,260
Why would I do that?

164
00:10:00,860 --> 00:10:03,230
- Well, think of a reward.
- Yeah.

165
00:10:04,200 --> 00:10:04,900
Do your best.

166
00:10:04,900 --> 00:10:05,900
Okay.

167
00:10:05,900 --> 00:10:10,740
First question.
Taro-kun went to the flower shop to buy flowers.

168
00:10:11,540 --> 00:10:13,010
So, what do you think?

169
00:10:14,140 --> 00:10:17,450
- Tick-tock, tick-tock.
- Don't say tick-tock!

170
00:10:18,850 --> 00:10:22,620
What the hell is that question?

171
00:10:23,150 --> 00:10:28,020
"He went to the flower shop to buy flowers.
So, what do you think? Tick-tock, tick-tock."
Are you fucking kidding me!?

172
00:10:28,920 --> 00:10:30,360
What am I supposed...

173
00:10:30,360 --> 00:10:32,630
- Stomping Quiz!!
- Listen to me!!!

174
00:10:32,960 --> 00:10:36,530
- Time for a stomping quiz.
- What in hell is that?

175
00:10:37,500 --> 00:10:42,970
What's the answer to that crazy question?

176
00:10:43,500 --> 00:10:45,170
Don't say tick-tock.

177
00:10:45,870 --> 00:10:48,880
And what's a stomping quiz all of a sudden?

178
00:10:48,880 --> 00:10:50,850
- It’s stomping quiz.
- So what!?

179
00:10:50,910 --> 00:10:54,750
Listen carefully and answer.
This is the second question.

180
00:10:55,680 --> 00:10:58,350
Hanako-san went to a public bath.

181
00:10:58,850 --> 00:11:00,490
So, what do you think?

182
00:11:01,920 --> 00:11:03,820
Don't say tick-tock!

183
00:11:04,590 --> 00:11:05,960
And what am I supposed to answer?

184
00:11:05,960 --> 00:11:09,360
"Hanako-san went to a public bath.
So, what do you think?"

185
00:11:10,160 --> 00:11:12,600
And what am I supposed to answer?

186
00:11:12,600 --> 00:11:14,040
She got refreshed, didn't she!?

187
00:11:18,710 --> 00:11:20,110
That's so-so.

188
00:11:21,840 --> 00:11:24,080
Give me an answer!

189
00:11:24,180 --> 00:11:26,810
If you think that's so-so, then tell me the right answer!

190
00:11:26,810 --> 00:11:28,220
Is the quiz confusing?

191
00:11:28,380 --> 00:11:30,150
That's not the point!!

192
00:11:30,720 --> 00:11:33,190
I prefer to settle things through discussion as much as possible.

193
00:11:33,620 --> 00:11:36,760
What am I supposed to say to a question like this?
You answer.

194
00:11:36,760 --> 00:11:38,630
Okay, I will make the question easier to understand.

195
00:11:38,630 --> 00:11:40,460
Isn't that obvious!?

196
00:11:41,000 --> 00:11:43,230
- Why didn't you do it from the start?
- Okay.

197
00:11:43,300 --> 00:11:45,900
Hamada-san, I've never done anything like this before.

198
00:11:47,100 --> 00:11:49,600
Since it's you who answers, I'll make the question easier.

199
00:11:50,040 --> 00:11:51,640
I'm sorry, but you'll have to.

200
00:11:51,840 --> 00:11:54,110
Taro-kun went to the public bath.

201
00:11:54,310 --> 00:11:55,410
Because!

202
00:11:57,680 --> 00:11:59,850
Taro-kun loves to take a bath.

203
00:12:01,150 --> 00:12:03,850
He sometimes goes there twice a day in summer.

204
00:12:05,390 --> 00:12:06,120
So, what do you think?

205
00:12:06,120 --> 00:12:07,690
Same as before!!

206
00:12:09,220 --> 00:12:12,160
It doesn't matter to me if he goes there two or three times a summer, asshole!

207
00:12:13,790 --> 00:12:17,000
Give me a clear-cut question instead of that.

208
00:12:17,430 --> 00:12:19,270
You want to get punched in the face?

209
00:12:20,870 --> 00:12:22,340
Say something!

210
00:12:22,700 --> 00:12:24,840
- Exotic Quiz!!
- What the hell is that!?

211
00:12:25,870 --> 00:12:28,410
- It’s exotic quiz.
- It doesn't matter.

212
00:12:28,940 --> 00:12:31,180
If Taro went to the public bath, what would be the answer?

213
00:12:31,780 --> 00:12:34,780
- It’s exotic quiz.
- It doesn't matter. What the hell is....

214
00:12:34,780 --> 00:12:35,680
Ding-dong
Ding-dong
Ding-dong
Ding-dong

215
00:12:35,680 --> 00:12:37,050
What the hell!!!

216
00:12:37,550 --> 00:12:39,390
- The buzzer went off.
- I don't care about that.

217
00:12:39,390 --> 00:12:40,450
This is a bonus quiz.

218
00:12:41,590 --> 00:12:44,690
If you can answer this, it will be doubled.

219
00:12:45,660 --> 00:12:46,530
Good luck!

220
00:12:47,330 --> 00:12:49,160
- What?
- It will be doubled.

221
00:12:50,700 --> 00:12:52,270
What will be doubled?

222
00:12:53,730 --> 00:12:59,110
Usually,  your points are doubled.
But you haven't answered a single question correctly yet.

223
00:12:59,110 --> 00:13:01,080
There is no way I can answer a question like that.

224
00:13:01,440 --> 00:13:02,710
So, I will be doubled.

225
00:13:05,650 --> 00:13:06,910
You will be doubled?

226
00:13:07,920 --> 00:13:09,920
I kinda want to see that, I'll try to answer correctly

227
00:13:11,250 --> 00:13:11,890
Good luck.

228
00:13:12,090 --> 00:13:17,560
- If I double, I will never disrespect you.
- Really?

229
00:13:18,460 --> 00:13:21,200
Hamada-san, you are picky.

230
00:13:22,700 --> 00:13:25,430
- Hey, wait.
- You complains a lot. So...

231
00:13:26,100 --> 00:13:29,500
Everyone will say the same thing to you that I do.

232
00:13:29,600 --> 00:13:33,510
You can pick your category.
Showbiz, history, sociology and geography.

233
00:13:34,510 --> 00:13:36,480
You have already made the right answer.

234
00:13:38,280 --> 00:13:43,320
- Which one will you pick?
- If you had done that from the beginning, I wouldn't have yelled at you.

235
00:13:43,320 --> 00:13:45,150
- Sorry.
- Never mind.

236
00:13:45,950 --> 00:13:48,760
- What can I pick from?
- Showbiz, history, sociology and geography.

237
00:13:50,890 --> 00:13:51,730
Geography.

238
00:13:52,330 --> 00:13:53,330
- Geography?
- Yes.

239
00:13:58,030 --> 00:13:59,230
Geography...okay.

240
00:13:59,230 --> 00:14:02,500
You should not pick that one.

241
00:14:02,500 --> 00:14:04,510
Can't I just pick one I like?

242
00:14:07,510 --> 00:14:08,680
How about history?

243
00:14:10,180 --> 00:14:12,850
Can't I just pick one I like?

244
00:14:13,050 --> 00:14:13,880
What?

245
00:14:14,250 --> 00:14:15,520
Which one would you pick?

246
00:14:15,780 --> 00:14:17,120
- Showbiz.
- Okay.

247
00:14:17,120 --> 00:14:20,620
Showbiz....?

248
00:14:21,290 --> 00:14:23,420
How about Geography?

249
00:14:24,260 --> 00:14:27,360
Earlier you said I shouldn't pick Geography.

250
00:14:27,360 --> 00:14:28,330
Pick whatever you want.

251
00:14:28,330 --> 00:14:30,430
Then history.

252
00:14:30,430 --> 00:14:32,170
History?
You want a history quiz?

253
00:14:33,170 --> 00:14:34,700
- Huh?
- You want a history quiz?

254
00:14:35,170 --> 00:14:37,070
Is there a problem?

255
00:14:37,070 --> 00:14:41,340
- I said earlier that I would be doubled, and now I'm going to be multiplied by 4.
- What the hell!

256
00:14:41,910 --> 00:14:46,010
You will be quadrupled!?

257
00:14:46,280 --> 00:14:48,750
- I'll try to answer correctly
- History question.

258
00:14:49,120 --> 00:14:50,280
Good luck.

259
00:14:50,650 --> 00:14:52,150
Taisuke Itagaki.

260
00:14:52,790 --> 00:14:53,650
So, what do you think?

261
00:14:57,790 --> 00:14:58,530
Wait.

262
00:14:59,160 --> 00:15:02,930
Give the same quiz to the audience.
And give me your answer.

263
00:15:03,430 --> 00:15:06,770
You don't have to give the next quiz, just tell me the answer to it.

264
00:15:07,200 --> 00:15:12,310
You only give a question, but you don't give an answer.
What am I supposed to say to that?

265
00:15:13,110 --> 00:15:14,410
Give your answer.

266
00:15:15,710 --> 00:15:18,310
What the hell am I...

267
00:15:18,310 --> 00:15:20,480
- Last Chance Quiz!!
- Listen to me!!!

268
00:15:20,710 --> 00:15:22,880
- It's time for the Last Chance Quiz.
- Answer it!

269
00:15:23,020 --> 00:15:24,650
- This is the last chance.
- Shut up!

270
00:15:24,950 --> 00:15:26,590
What's that?

271
00:15:26,790 --> 00:15:31,460
- This is your last chance, good luck!
- Better yet, give me the answer to the question you just asked.

272
00:15:31,460 --> 00:15:32,990
Good luck.

273
00:15:32,990 --> 00:15:34,530
What's the answer to your earlier question!?

274
00:15:34,860 --> 00:15:36,630
Is this question confusing?

275
00:15:37,670 --> 00:15:39,270
That's not the point!!

276
00:15:39,270 --> 00:15:42,800
Considering 1 mark as 46 yen would be comprehensible.

277
00:15:42,800 --> 00:15:44,640
What the hell does that make it comprehensible!?

278
00:15:45,440 --> 00:15:47,110
This is the last chance.

279
00:15:47,440 --> 00:15:49,180
If you answer this correctly, Hamada-san will become a Filipino.

280
00:15:49,180 --> 00:15:50,380
I don't want to be that!!

281
00:15:50,880 --> 00:15:55,050
This is the last chance.
You bet on this!

282
00:15:55,480 --> 00:15:57,720
You are messed up.

283
00:15:58,590 --> 00:15:59,550
This is the last chance quiz.

284
00:15:59,550 --> 00:16:01,620
- Make it an easy question.
- Okay.

285
00:16:01,620 --> 00:16:02,890
Listen to the question carefully.

286
00:16:03,460 --> 00:16:07,060
Were there 60 apples in the colander?

287
00:16:16,570 --> 00:16:17,440
Yes.

288
00:16:17,440 --> 00:16:20,710
Ding-dong, ding-dong!
Correct! You are a Filipino!

289
00:16:21,840 --> 00:16:25,680
"Quiz: You are a Filipino from tomorrow."
See you next week at this time!

290
00:16:32,590 --> 00:16:33,620
Oh, I'm tired.

291
00:16:34,320 --> 00:16:35,120
Yeah.

292
00:16:35,120 --> 00:16:37,060
Today is the first time I've ever been tired after doing a manzai.

293
00:16:37,060 --> 00:16:38,060
Yeah.

294
00:16:39,590 --> 00:16:41,800
Enough is enough.

295
00:16:42,800 --> 00:16:44,200
I'm tired.

296
00:16:45,000 --> 00:16:48,640
I spoke faster than I thought I would.

297
00:16:48,640 --> 00:16:50,570
I know.

298
00:16:50,940 --> 00:16:53,410
Were you a littl e nervous?

299
00:16:53,510 --> 00:16:56,910
Maybe so. So let's not do this anymore.

300
00:16:57,480 --> 00:16:58,710
No, we're going to do it,

301
00:16:59,550 --> 00:17:03,250
don't stop.
We didn't have enough time today, we have to do it again next week.

302
00:17:04,720 --> 00:17:06,320
- But...
- What?

303
00:17:06,920 --> 00:17:08,520
But that's enough.

304
00:17:10,020 --> 00:17:12,530
We didn't have enough time today.

305
00:17:12,930 --> 00:17:22,500
Then next week, let's do it for 40 minutes, doubling the time.

306
00:17:22,500 --> 00:17:23,840
How about changing the clientele?

307
00:17:23,900 --> 00:17:26,610
Today's clientele was mostly female office workers.

308
00:17:27,340 --> 00:17:29,880
So next week, let's invite Indians.

309
00:17:31,850 --> 00:17:33,410
Do you mind if they are silent?

310
00:17:33,910 --> 00:17:37,280
- We have a great curry joke.
- We don't have such a thing.

311
00:17:38,050 --> 00:17:39,420
We don't have such a thing.

312
00:17:39,750 --> 00:17:41,760
Curry joke?

313
00:17:41,760 --> 00:17:43,620
Let's think about that too.

314
00:17:43,620 --> 00:17:44,530
Do you want to change the clientele?

315
00:17:44,990 --> 00:17:47,260
Yes.

316
00:17:47,260 --> 00:17:49,500
But I thought today was the best one.

317
00:17:49,500 --> 00:17:51,030
I guess so.

318
00:17:51,270 --> 00:17:59,970
Let's do 30 or 40 minutes on time next week.

319
00:18:00,510 --> 00:18:02,040
Yeah.

320
00:18:02,640 --> 00:18:07,820
The staff probably thinks, "What the heck are these guys doing?"

321
00:18:08,820 --> 00:18:10,920
Hey, don't nod, Yanaoka!

322
00:18:12,190 --> 00:18:22,400
So, let's do a spirited manzai next week after a long time.

323
00:18:22,400 --> 00:18:23,860
Why not this week?

324
00:18:25,100 --> 00:18:26,670
Why didn't you do it from the start?

325
00:18:26,930 --> 00:18:30,540
But this is a 2:10 AM broadcast.

326
00:18:30,540 --> 00:18:32,010
What? You have a problem with the air time?

327
00:18:32,010 --> 00:18:33,970
The guys watching this are probably sleepwalking, too.

328
00:18:34,780 --> 00:18:36,410
Don't be ridiculous.

329
00:18:37,210 --> 00:18:42,180
Let's make people laugh in the middle of the night.

330
00:18:42,580 --> 00:18:46,620
There's probably no other comedy show going on tv right now.

331
00:18:46,620 --> 00:18:48,190
No other TV station does comedy.

332
00:18:48,620 --> 00:18:51,130
Only Nihon TV does this.

333
00:18:51,130 --> 00:18:54,290
This is a comedy show at 2:10 AM.

334
00:18:55,000 --> 00:18:56,530
That's what makes it a joke.

335
00:18:57,500 --> 00:18:58,630
What's so funny?

336
00:18:59,900 --> 00:19:00,670
Broadcast the current part.

337
00:19:00,670 --> 00:19:05,970
Anyway, the first one was still not good enough for us.

338
00:19:06,270 --> 00:19:14,450
So, can you do a half hour next week?

339
00:19:16,080 --> 00:19:17,380
Are you asking me?

340
00:19:17,380 --> 00:19:18,950
Who else but you?

341
00:19:18,950 --> 00:19:20,820
Ah...hmm....yeah.

342
00:19:22,690 --> 00:19:24,760
Say something like, " Of course I can".

343
00:19:24,760 --> 00:19:26,290
Well, let's do it.

344
00:19:26,290 --> 00:19:27,590
Maybe we' ll do it.

345
00:19:27,590 --> 00:19:29,560
"Maybe"?

346
00:19:29,560 --> 00:19:39,040
We'll be airing Downtown's manzai again next week.
In the meantime, please watch plenty of our manzai next week.

347
00:19:39,610 --> 00:19:41,240
See you next week!

348
00:19:41,240 --> 00:19:42,740
See you!

349
00:19:43,740 --> 00:19:48,450
