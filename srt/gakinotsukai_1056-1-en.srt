Standing by for Gaki no Tsukai recording time.

00:00:05,500 --> 00:00:06,650
WHAT?!!

00:00:06,740 --> 00:00:09,420

Shozo Endo

11
00:00:07,920 --> 00:00:09,780
What did you do?

12
00:00:09,500 --> 00:00:11,680
Downtown

13
00:00:09,500 --> 00:00:11,680
Masatoshi Hamada

14
00:00:09,780 --> 00:00:10,340
What'd you do?

15
00:00:10,340 --> 00:00:11,680
You just gave me a look.

16
00:00:11,900 --> 00:00:13,980
Yes, I just looked at you but...

17
00:00:13,980 --> 00:00:17,380
...I get yelled at just for that?

18
00:00:17,380 --> 00:00:18,990
I don't know how you can ever work together.

19
00:00:18,990 --> 00:00:21,980
You must've woke up on the wrong side of the bed, Hamada-san.

20
00:00:21,980 --> 00:00:24,160
Trust me, I won't look your way.

21
00:00:24,160 --> 00:00:25,420
He got you good.

22
00:00:26,380 --> 00:00:27,460
I'm scared now.

23
00:00:27,460 --> 00:00:30,960
By the way, what's with your small bag?

24
00:00:30,960 --> 00:00:32,120
That's new, right?

25
00:00:32,120 --> 00:00:33,480
No, I've had it for awhile.

26
00:00:33,490 --> 00:00:34,600
You're serious?

27
00:00:35,960 --> 00:00:38,560
Downtown Manager

28
00:00:35,960 --> 00:00:38,560
Naoya Orita

29
00:00:37,220 --> 00:00:38,560
Good morning.

30
00:00:40,520 --> 00:00:43,340
Matsumoto-san has requested that all of you...

31
00:00:43,580 --> 00:00:45,500
Oh, I just assumed he was running late.

32
00:00:45,500 --> 00:00:46,360
Me too.

33
00:00:47,100 --> 00:00:47,920
What do you want?

34
00:00:48,640 --> 00:00:50,650
Well...

35
00:00:50,650 --> 00:00:55,780
...he was wondering how well you know his likes and dislikes.

36
00:00:55,780 --> 00:00:57,120
He seemed very preoccupied with this idea.

37
00:00:57,120 --> 00:00:59,220
He's that curious?

38
00:01:00,140 --> 00:01:01,320
I don't get it.

39
00:01:01,320 --> 00:01:02,640
So what should we do?

40
00:01:02,640 --> 00:01:06,040
Well, he wants you to come to the studio.

41
00:01:06,040 --> 00:01:06,940
But why?

42
00:01:06,940 --> 00:01:09,040
Why can't we talk about it here?

43
00:01:09,040 --> 00:01:10,880
We can discuss it here, right?

44
00:01:10,880 --> 00:01:14,630
He was very set on having it in the studio.

45
00:01:16,720 --> 00:01:19,540
How can I feel good about this?

46
00:01:19,540 --> 00:01:21,220
Am I right?

47
00:01:21,310 --> 00:01:26,040
Downtown Presents:
Gaki No Tsukai Ya Arahende!!

48
00:01:28,520 --> 00:01:30,140
Wow!

49
00:01:30,140 --> 00:01:32,520
What a huge space we've got here!?

50
00:01:33,540 --> 00:01:34,620
He's in here?

51
00:01:33,540 --> 00:01:39,860
They get invited into one of largest studios

52
00:01:34,620 --> 00:01:35,560
Yes.

53
00:01:35,560 --> 00:01:36,560
In here?

54
00:01:36,560 --> 00:01:38,820
But why in the studio?

55
00:01:38,820 --> 00:01:40,320
Yeah, why?

56
00:01:40,920 --> 00:01:41,640
Wow!

57
00:01:42,860 --> 00:01:44,940
How big is this studio?!

58
00:01:44,940 --> 00:01:45,600
It's gigantic.

59
00:01:45,600 --> 00:01:47,920
It feels huge when there's no set in here.

60
00:01:48,780 --> 00:01:50,460
Where's Matsumoto anyhow?

61
00:01:50,460 --> 00:01:53,140
Matsumoto-san is...

62
00:01:53,560 --> 00:01:55,360
What's that say?

63
00:01:55,360 --> 00:01:56,680
What's this?

64
00:01:56,680 --> 00:01:58,040
What's that sign say?

65
00:01:58,040 --> 00:02:05,600
"Present Something Matsumoto Might Like and Win His Heart!"

66
00:02:05,600 --> 00:02:07,640
There used to be a show like this.

67
00:02:07,640 --> 00:02:08,020
What?

68
00:02:08,020 --> 00:02:11,400
This will tell us if he likes certain things?

69
00:02:11,740 --> 00:02:15,480
So we put an object here?

70
00:02:13,000 --> 00:02:14,560
I see

71
00:02:14,660 --> 00:02:15,480
I see.

72
00:02:15,860 --> 00:02:17,640
Should we go for it?

73
00:02:17,320 --> 00:02:17,980
Yes, let's.

74
00:02:17,980 --> 00:02:20,240
Let's go find stuff he might like.

75
00:02:21,040 --> 00:02:23,600
Since we're here, there's no turning back.

76
00:02:24,500 --> 00:02:25,960
What can we find around here?

77
00:02:26,680 --> 00:02:31,920
They search for items Matsumoto might like...

78
00:02:32,280 --> 00:02:35,040
30 minutes later...

79
00:02:32,660 --> 00:02:34,040
We got some stuff...

80
00:02:34,040 --> 00:02:35,320
We got some random things.

81
00:02:35,320 --> 00:02:36,140
Now what?

82
00:02:36,140 --> 00:02:37,380
What's first?

83
00:02:37,380 --> 00:02:39,060
Let's just pick one.

84
00:02:39,060 --> 00:02:40,680
We can pick whatever.

85
00:02:40,980 --> 00:02:43,800
He likes these kind of snacks...

86
00:02:42,800 --> 00:02:43,800
Yes he does.

87
00:02:44,620 --> 00:02:46,140
Let's start with one of them.

88
00:02:46,240 --> 00:02:47,160
Which one first?

89
00:02:47,460 --> 00:02:48,700
Beef jerky or...

90
00:02:47,460 --> 00:02:54,900
Beef Jerky

91
00:02:48,700 --> 00:02:49,580
...dried squid?

92
00:02:48,700 --> 00:02:54,900
Dried Squid

93
00:02:49,580 --> 00:02:52,200
Which would you pick, Hamada-san?

94
00:02:52,200 --> 00:02:54,620
He likes both of these.

95
00:02:54,620 --> 00:02:56,740
But he's getting too old to chew on these.

96
00:02:56,740 --> 00:02:58,020
Too old?

97
00:02:57,970 --> 00:03:08,740
Beef Jerky

98
00:02:57,970 --> 00:03:08,740
Dried Squid

99
00:02:58,020 --> 00:03:00,060
I know that makes two of us, but...

100
00:03:00,060 --> 00:03:01,660
But you're not that old.

101
00:03:02,040 --> 00:03:03,500
C'mon, you can still chew on it.

102
00:03:03,500 --> 00:03:05,360
I know, but this one seems a bit...

103
00:03:05,360 --> 00:03:07,160
I know he's a big fan of this!

104
00:03:07,160 --> 00:03:08,720
You sure?

105
00:03:09,000 --> 00:03:11,950
He has always liked gnawing on them since he was young!

106
00:03:11,950 --> 00:03:14,720
Could you make it any more foul sounding?

107
00:03:11,950 --> 00:03:20,660
Beef Jerky

108
00:03:11,950 --> 00:03:20,660
Dried Squid

109
00:03:15,520 --> 00:03:16,880
Go with this one?

110
00:03:17,240 --> 00:03:18,240
That's it.

111
00:03:18,240 --> 00:03:19,900
I'm positive about this.

112
00:03:19,900 --> 00:03:21,180
You're 100% sure?

113
00:03:21,180 --> 00:03:22,980
Let's go for it.

114
00:03:23,560 --> 00:03:24,460
Here's beef jerky.

115
00:03:24,460 --> 00:03:26,320
Beef jerky!

116
00:03:26,320 --> 00:03:27,520
I'm 100% sure.

117
00:03:33,510 --> 00:03:36,180
So that idiot's been hiding in there.

118
00:03:37,780 --> 00:03:39,680
Yes, I can hear him inside.

119
00:03:42,000 --> 00:03:43,020
There's he is!

120
00:03:43,020 --> 00:03:43,800
That's him.

121
00:03:45,600 --> 00:03:47,820
What a moron!

122
00:03:47,820 --> 00:03:48,940
That's him alright.

123
00:03:49,920 --> 00:03:51,400
Oh, he's taking it!

124
00:03:52,860 --> 00:03:54,000
He's taking it.

125
00:03:54,380 --> 00:03:57,060
I thought he'd go for the dried squid, but it's beef jerky, huh...

126
00:03:58,140 --> 00:03:59,400
I wish he'd hurry up.

127
00:04:00,480 --> 00:04:01,400
He's contemplating.

128
00:04:01,780 --> 00:04:02,800
Which is it?

129
00:04:04,280 --> 00:04:05,880
He took it!

130
00:04:06,740 --> 00:04:10,280
But seriously, what the hell's wrong with him?

131
00:04:11,700 --> 00:04:13,060
What's that all about?

132
00:04:13,060 --> 00:04:23,100
I still have a fond memory of trying this for the first time.

133
00:04:23,600 --> 00:04:25,140
He remembers that?

134
00:04:25,140 --> 00:04:27,420
That's why he likes it.

135
00:04:27,900 --> 00:04:29,880
Seriously, what is this?

136
00:04:29,880 --> 00:04:30,960
How irritating.

137
00:04:30,960 --> 00:04:32,160
So he likes it?

138
00:04:32,160 --> 00:04:33,300
That's why he took it!

139
00:04:33,300 --> 00:04:34,820
So you were right!

140
00:04:34,960 --> 00:04:35,580
Right?

141
00:04:35,580 --> 00:04:36,280
You got it, Yama-chan.

142
00:04:36,290 --> 00:04:38,280
I knew he liked beef jerky.

143
00:04:38,280 --> 00:04:38,920
Is that so?

144
00:04:39,600 --> 00:04:41,920
Does he have a sweet tooth?

145
00:04:41,920 --> 00:04:42,960
Like this Swiss roll?

146
00:04:41,960 --> 00:05:05,920
Swiss Roll

147
00:04:42,960 --> 00:04:44,300
Right, the Swiss roll.

148
00:04:44,300 --> 00:04:46,020
I'm stumped.

149
00:04:46,020 --> 00:04:48,220
Does he eat sweets when you guys go out?

150
00:04:48,220 --> 00:04:51,390
He started to recently.

151
00:04:49,960 --> 00:04:51,390
He never used to.

152
00:04:51,390 --> 00:04:54,500
Right, he never touched sweets until recently.

153
00:04:55,160 --> 00:04:56,400
So he orders dessert?

154
00:04:56,400 --> 00:05:01,600
Yeah, I catch him sucking on sweets all the time.

155
00:05:01,600 --> 00:05:03,200
Can you be less graphic?

156
00:05:03,400 --> 00:05:04,580
Did that sound bad?

157
00:05:04,580 --> 00:05:05,930
I didn't mean to...

158
00:05:05,930 --> 00:05:07,940
I'm curious about what would happen with the roll.

159
00:05:07,940 --> 00:05:09,280
It's a mystery item.

160
00:05:09,280 --> 00:05:12,080
I would like to know his position on this one.

161
00:05:13,780 --> 00:05:16,920
Next up is the Swiss Roll.

162
00:05:16,920 --> 00:05:19,880
Is Matsumoto a fan?

163
00:05:20,720 --> 00:05:22,500
He started to eat sweets recently.

164
00:05:22,500 --> 00:05:23,160
You sure?

165
00:05:23,160 --> 00:05:23,700
Yes...

166
00:05:23,700 --> 00:05:25,240
Even Swiss rolls?

167
00:05:29,280 --> 00:05:31,100
What's with the sound effects?

168
00:05:33,400 --> 00:05:35,200
Please let me smack him once.

169
00:05:35,980 --> 00:05:37,980
Seriously, what the hell do you think you're doing?

170
00:05:38,420 --> 00:05:40,100
Take it already!

171
00:05:40,100 --> 00:05:42,100
He must be contemplating.

172
00:05:42,220 --> 00:05:43,720
He's thinking about it?

173
00:05:44,120 --> 00:05:45,720
Does he like it or not?

174
00:05:47,080 --> 00:05:48,320
Can't you reach?

175
00:05:50,460 --> 00:05:50,900
See?

176
00:05:51,040 --> 00:05:52,500
You were right!

177
00:05:52,880 --> 00:05:54,280
You got it?

178
00:05:54,280 --> 00:05:56,480
Why the stare down?

179
00:05:56,480 --> 00:05:58,020
Very hard stare down.

180
00:05:58,660 --> 00:06:00,140
I wish he'd hurry up.

181
00:06:02,520 --> 00:06:03,860
Incredible!

182
00:06:04,940 --> 00:06:06,000
I didn't know...

183
00:06:06,600 --> 00:06:07,560
I had no idea...

184
00:06:07,560 --> 00:06:09,320
Right?

185
00:06:09,700 --> 00:06:14,440
Because of the eating sensation is strong.

186
00:06:13,480 --> 00:06:14,440
Shut the hell up.

187
00:06:16,360 --> 00:06:18,260
He likes it because...

188
00:06:18,260 --> 00:06:18,940
I don't get it.

189
00:06:18,940 --> 00:06:20,360
What's a strong eating sensation?

190
00:06:20,900 --> 00:06:21,840
He lost me.

191
00:06:22,020 --> 00:06:26,680
Let's yank him outta there and beat him up?

192
00:06:25,760 --> 00:06:26,680
Is that OK?

193
00:06:26,900 --> 00:06:29,300
If Hamada-san if giving us permission, then...

194
00:06:29,300 --> 00:06:31,220
We'll gladly help you.

195
00:06:31,740 --> 00:06:32,720
What a combo though.

196
00:06:32,720 --> 00:06:35,020
Beef jerky and Swiss roll.

197
00:06:35,020 --> 00:06:36,460
He likes them for sure.

198
00:06:36,680 --> 00:06:39,750
We pretty much got things we like.

199
00:06:39,760 --> 00:06:40,700
You're right.

200
00:06:40,700 --> 00:06:42,300
I don't know if it's a coincidence but...

201
00:06:42,630 --> 00:06:45,900
But who from Osaka wouldn't be into takoyaki?

202
00:06:44,600 --> 00:06:45,900
Of course, he likes it.

203
00:06:46,420 --> 00:06:49,740
Or the 551 brand pork buns.

204
00:06:46,420 --> 00:06:49,740
T/N: 551 Horai is a famous pork bun brand that is exclusive to Osaka.

205
00:06:49,740 --> 00:06:50,900
Hit him with the takoyaki?

206
00:06:50,900 --> 00:06:53,060
Let's go for it.

207
00:06:52,000 --> 00:06:53,060
He's 100% into this.

208
00:06:53,060 --> 00:06:54,680
We did something like this before...

209
00:06:55,040 --> 00:06:56,020
That's right!

210
00:06:56,660 --> 00:06:58,360
I'm pretty sure he likes these.

211
00:06:58,480 --> 00:06:59,960
Let's put them right here.

212
00:07:02,080 --> 00:07:04,200
Right on the line.

213
00:07:08,640 --> 00:07:09,280
What?

214
00:07:09,620 --> 00:07:11,020
This thing isn't designed well.

215
00:07:11,020 --> 00:07:12,430
Not only that, but...

216
00:07:12,430 --> 00:07:15,020
...something's wrong with his teeth.

217
00:07:15,020 --> 00:07:16,030
Where's his other tooth?

218
00:07:16,700 --> 00:07:17,560
What happened?

219
00:07:17,560 --> 00:07:19,120
Can he take it?

220
00:07:19,120 --> 00:07:22,120
He needs to find a way to grab it.

221
00:07:22,120 --> 00:07:23,640
If he likes it enough, he'll get it.

222
00:07:23,640 --> 00:07:24,520
That's right.

223
00:07:24,520 --> 00:07:25,750
He can make it happen.

224
00:07:25,750 --> 00:07:27,700
It's still inside the square.

225
00:07:27,700 --> 00:07:29,060
He's gonna pull a muscle.

226
00:07:29,060 --> 00:07:30,100
That'll hurt.

227
00:07:31,300 --> 00:07:33,300
Where there's a will, there's a way.

228
00:07:34,740 --> 00:07:36,340
If he wants it bad enough...

229
00:07:36,340 --> 00:07:37,960
If he likes it, he'll get it.

230
00:07:43,480 --> 00:07:44,720
He got it!

231
00:07:44,720 --> 00:07:45,520
He loves it.

232
00:07:45,520 --> 00:07:47,000
Incredible!

233
00:07:48,660 --> 00:07:50,880
Because it makes me ecstatic.

234
00:07:50,880 --> 00:07:53,800
Because it makes me ecstatic.

235
00:07:54,260 --> 00:07:56,120
It doesn't take much...

236
00:07:56,500 --> 00:07:58,600
All it takes is takoyaki to make him ecstatic.

237
00:07:57,860 --> 00:07:59,400
Only takoyaki...

238
00:07:59,400 --> 00:08:00,560
He's from Osaka after all...

239
00:08:00,560 --> 00:08:01,950
You've got a point.

240
00:08:01,950 --> 00:08:02,540
Good point.

241
00:08:03,640 --> 00:08:04,880
Yama-chan, your turn.

242
00:08:04,880 --> 00:08:05,800
Offer him something.

243
00:08:05,800 --> 00:08:07,580
Well, well, well...

244
00:08:08,020 --> 00:08:09,580
Endo and Tanaka just went so...

245
00:08:09,580 --> 00:08:10,800
I see...

246
00:08:11,000 --> 00:08:12,600
How about this one?

247
00:08:12,720 --> 00:08:13,360
What's that?

248
00:08:13,500 --> 00:08:16,520
This is more like a "necessity".

249
00:08:16,740 --> 00:08:18,300
It's a hair clipper!

250
00:08:18,300 --> 00:08:19,750
What did you think it was?

251
00:08:19,780 --> 00:08:21,720
I thought it was an electric razor.

252
00:08:21,720 --> 00:08:22,860
It looks similar.

253
00:08:22,860 --> 00:08:25,020
OK, so you choose the clipper.

254
00:08:26,500 --> 00:08:31,020
Matsumoto's good friend, Yamasaki, chooses the hair clipper.

255
00:08:31,520 --> 00:08:32,680
I'm sure he likes this.

256
00:08:44,640 --> 00:08:45,760
A different movement.

257
00:08:48,040 --> 00:08:49,260
What's he doing?

258
00:08:49,260 --> 00:08:53,200
Is he confirming something?

259
00:08:55,460 --> 00:08:56,460
He's looking at it.

260
00:08:56,460 --> 00:08:59,240
Oh, he can pick things up.

261
00:09:00,000 --> 00:09:01,560
I thought he could only pull things in.

262
00:09:01,560 --> 00:09:03,020
He's still looking at us.

263
00:09:03,020 --> 00:09:05,240
He's got it in his hand.

264
00:09:08,700 --> 00:09:09,800
How's it gonna be?

265
00:09:09,800 --> 00:09:11,200
Which is it?

266
00:09:17,800 --> 00:09:19,000
It's not something to like or dislike, right?

267
00:09:19,000 --> 00:09:21,140
It's not something to like or dislike, right?

268
00:09:21,140 --> 00:09:22,730
It's not something to like or dislike, right?

269
00:09:24,260 --> 00:09:25,550
It's neither, I guess.

270
00:09:25,550 --> 00:09:27,800
It's not a "like" or "dislike".

271
00:09:28,400 --> 00:09:31,450
See, you shouldn't have picked something like that.

272
00:09:31,450 --> 00:09:33,450
From now on...

273
00:09:33,800 --> 00:09:38,220
...if you're wrong, you will be slapped in the face.

274
00:09:38,220 --> 00:09:40,480
...if you're wrong, you will be slapped in the face.

275
00:09:41,200 --> 00:09:42,480
I don't want that.

276
00:09:43,180 --> 00:09:44,920
Seriously, what's this all about?

277
00:09:44,920 --> 00:09:47,860
By the way, his voice is way too distorted.

278
00:09:48,080 --> 00:09:48,660
His voice isn't clear.

279
00:09:48,660 --> 00:09:49,980
It's hard to understand.

280
00:09:49,980 --> 00:09:50,760
Endo, you go again.

281
00:09:50,760 --> 00:09:51,400
Shall I?

282
00:09:51,400 --> 00:09:52,840
I don't want to be wrong.

283
00:09:52,840 --> 00:09:53,860
A face slap?

284
00:09:53,860 --> 00:09:55,060
I don't want to be slapped.

285
00:09:55,070 --> 00:09:56,700
Who's slapping us anyhow?

286
00:09:57,100 --> 00:09:58,500
I choose the socks.

287
00:09:58,720 --> 00:10:00,920
Just pick what you like.

288
00:10:00,920 --> 00:10:01,780
You're right.

289
00:10:01,780 --> 00:10:03,260
These are quite useful...

290
00:10:04,320 --> 00:10:05,600
See these toe socks?

291
00:10:05,640 --> 00:10:06,720
You're going for it?

292
00:10:07,080 --> 00:10:08,160
That's your final pick?

293
00:10:08,160 --> 00:10:08,580
Yes.

294
00:10:08,860 --> 00:10:10,160
Go for it then.

295
00:10:10,160 --> 00:10:11,200
Here we go.

296
00:10:11,780 --> 00:10:13,780
Here's a pair of toe socks.

297
00:10:21,620 --> 00:10:22,720
He sounds a little different.

298
00:10:23,620 --> 00:10:26,660
He's got a different set of teeth, too.

299
00:10:27,880 --> 00:10:30,540
His character keeps changing.

300
00:10:38,280 --> 00:10:39,460
Take them!

301
00:10:41,000 --> 00:10:42,400
There! He got them!

302
00:10:46,900 --> 00:10:48,040
Take them already!

303
00:10:50,860 --> 00:10:52,600
Keep it down!

304
00:10:53,140 --> 00:10:54,700
The machine's broken.

305
00:10:54,700 --> 00:10:56,180
It's completely out of order.

306
00:10:56,940 --> 00:10:58,700
It's sweating bullets too.

307
00:11:05,400 --> 00:11:06,780
He doesn't like them...

308
00:11:08,420 --> 00:11:10,000
A slap from Tanaka.

309
00:11:10,000 --> 00:11:11,800
A slap from Tanaka.

310
00:11:12,380 --> 00:11:13,420
From Tanaka?

311
00:11:13,420 --> 00:11:14,900
So I slap him?

312
00:11:14,900 --> 00:11:17,080
I'm supposed to slap Endo then?

313
00:11:17,080 --> 00:11:19,860
I see, Tanaka gets to slap me.

314
00:11:19,860 --> 00:11:20,920
Me?

315
00:11:22,220 --> 00:11:23,380
This sucks.

316
00:11:23,380 --> 00:11:25,380
I don't like it either.

317
00:11:25,380 --> 00:11:26,720
What're you gonna do?

318
00:11:26,720 --> 00:11:29,040
Shouldn't it be Yamasaki or Hamada-san?

319
00:11:29,040 --> 00:11:31,700
Well, it was an order.

320
00:11:31,700 --> 00:11:33,700
Ok, I'm ready.

321
00:11:33,700 --> 00:11:35,120
This sucks.

322
00:11:35,120 --> 00:11:36,280
You ready?

323
00:11:41,240 --> 00:11:42,860
He's looking!

324
00:11:42,860 --> 00:11:43,660
He witnessed it.

325
00:11:43,660 --> 00:11:44,920
He peeked.

326
00:11:44,920 --> 00:11:46,100
Yes, he was looking.

327
00:11:46,100 --> 00:11:47,360
Was that good?

328
00:11:47,360 --> 00:11:48,720
Was that good?

329
00:11:48,880 --> 00:11:51,980
OK, I'll take it.

330
00:11:51,980 --> 00:11:54,600
OK.

331
00:11:54,760 --> 00:11:57,680
That was good.

332
00:11:57,680 --> 00:11:59,360
He sounds very easy going.

333
00:11:59,360 --> 00:12:01,580
He's really pissing me off now.

334
00:12:02,140 --> 00:12:03,960
Well, not much I can do.

335
00:12:03,960 --> 00:12:05,820
I'm feeling this one.

336
00:12:05,900 --> 00:12:10,120
This comes in handy when your face is sweaty.

337
00:12:10,480 --> 00:12:11,840
I choose the wet wipes.

338
00:12:11,840 --> 00:12:13,120
I've got a good feeling.

339
00:12:13,120 --> 00:12:14,240
Go for it.

340
00:12:14,240 --> 00:12:15,080
I'll get him.

341
00:12:14,480 --> 00:12:15,080
Good luck!

342
00:12:15,220 --> 00:12:16,840
Here's a set of wet wipes.

343
00:12:23,600 --> 00:12:24,900
What the...?

344
00:12:26,240 --> 00:12:27,160
He's looking!

345
00:12:27,160 --> 00:12:28,620
There he is!

346
00:12:31,920 --> 00:12:33,160
He's out!

347
00:12:33,840 --> 00:12:35,160
Using both hands even!

348
00:12:35,160 --> 00:12:35,980
Pretty good.

349
00:12:36,860 --> 00:12:38,300
That's a new move!

350
00:12:39,100 --> 00:12:41,920
He's acting like he's into them.

351
00:12:43,220 --> 00:12:45,180
Hurry the hell up!

352
00:12:46,000 --> 00:12:47,180
Don't try to break the machine!

353
00:12:47,180 --> 00:12:48,380
He breaks easily.

354
00:12:55,080 --> 00:12:57,360
You hurt his feelings!

355
00:12:58,560 --> 00:13:01,360
He's being loud as hell and sweating up a storm!

356
00:13:01,640 --> 00:13:03,640
Just hurry up and grab it!

357
00:13:03,690 --> 00:13:07,800
Because you tore my spirit in half.

358
00:13:06,280 --> 00:13:07,780
See that?

359
00:13:07,800 --> 00:13:09,040
It's not about just the things he likes.

360
00:13:09,040 --> 00:13:10,720
Slapping him was a bad move?

361
00:13:11,540 --> 00:13:12,720
Sorry about that.

362
00:13:12,720 --> 00:13:14,000
I apologize.

363
00:13:14,100 --> 00:13:16,760
Endo slaps Hamada.

364
00:13:16,760 --> 00:13:18,220
No way.

365
00:13:18,220 --> 00:13:19,280
Phew!

366
00:13:19,280 --> 00:13:23,960
I was just thinking, "Please don't make me slap Hamada-san."

367
00:13:23,960 --> 00:13:25,280
This sucks!

368
00:13:25,280 --> 00:13:26,880
Hamada-san, I don't know if I can...

369
00:13:26,880 --> 00:13:28,680
I need to watch this closely.

370
00:13:29,440 --> 00:13:31,040
You don't get to see this too often.

371
00:13:31,040 --> 00:13:32,140
This never happens.

372
00:13:32,140 --> 00:13:33,460
I'm sorry in advance.

373
00:13:34,320 --> 00:13:35,560
Please don't take this personally.

374
00:13:36,240 --> 00:13:40,030
Damn, he's been staring the whole time.

375
00:13:41,680 --> 00:13:44,100
Right, he's been staring with both eyes.

376
00:13:43,120 --> 00:13:44,100
He's not even trying to hide.

377
00:13:44,220 --> 00:13:46,120
That's beyond peeking.

378
00:13:46,120 --> 00:13:47,820
He might as well come all the way out.

379
00:13:48,640 --> 00:13:49,960
Please excuse me.

380
00:13:56,580 --> 00:13:58,720
Look at him chuckling.

381
00:13:59,140 --> 00:14:02,240
Not hard enough.

382
00:14:02,240 --> 00:14:04,060
I thought that was good enough.

383
00:14:04,060 --> 00:14:05,500
I disagree!

384
00:14:05,500 --> 00:14:07,500
I slapped him fair and square!

385
00:14:07,780 --> 00:14:11,980
Hit him a little harder.

386
00:14:12,380 --> 00:14:13,540
What a nightmare.

387
00:14:13,540 --> 00:14:14,940
Yeah, pretty hellish.

388
00:14:14,940 --> 00:14:16,600
This is the worst.

389
00:14:17,300 --> 00:14:19,420
What a bad deal for both of us.

390
00:14:19,940 --> 00:14:21,800
Endo, there's not much you can do now.

391
00:14:21,800 --> 00:14:23,260
Even Hamada-san can't do anything about this.

392
00:14:23,260 --> 00:14:25,660
Just make this one count.

393
00:14:25,660 --> 00:14:26,720
What the...

394
00:14:26,770 --> 00:14:29,520
WHAT THE HELL ARE YOU LOOKING AT!?

395
00:14:30,420 --> 00:14:31,520
He's not shy about this.

396
00:14:32,160 --> 00:14:33,740
Just get over with.

397
00:14:33,740 --> 00:14:35,000
Right, I don't want to have to do this again.

398
00:14:35,000 --> 00:14:35,640
Agreed.

399
00:14:35,640 --> 00:14:36,670
Try to ignore him.

400
00:14:36,900 --> 00:14:39,450
He won't stop looking.

401
00:14:38,140 --> 00:14:39,450
I won't hold back then.

402
00:14:39,660 --> 00:14:41,200
Here I go!

403
00:14:41,200 --> 00:14:42,520
Ready?

404
00:14:53,880 --> 00:14:55,300
You ok, Hamada-san?

405
00:14:55,860 --> 00:14:57,160
OK, Hamada-san!?

406
00:14:57,560 --> 00:14:59,160
Hamada-san!

407
00:14:59,160 --> 00:15:00,900
Tell me you're ok.

408
00:15:00,900 --> 00:15:03,000
You ok?

409
00:15:03,620 --> 00:15:05,100
My ear is ringing.

410
00:15:05,100 --> 00:15:06,270
His ear is ringing.

411
00:15:07,520 --> 00:15:08,350
That was awesome.

412
00:15:08,350 --> 00:15:11,000
That was awesome.

413
00:15:10,200 --> 00:15:11,160
"That was awesome."

414
00:15:11,220 --> 00:15:14,440
How dare you hide behind there and laugh hysterically.

415
00:15:16,880 --> 00:15:18,240
That shook my head.

416
00:15:18,240 --> 00:15:19,740
I'm so sorry.

417
00:15:19,820 --> 00:15:24,480
I'm mature enough to keep my composure in front of the camera.

418
00:15:22,550 --> 00:15:25,860
Wait, you'd be pissed if there were no cameras?

419
00:15:26,700 --> 00:15:31,300
What would the viewers think if I got seriously pissed off?

420
00:15:33,450 --> 00:15:38,180
Next up, Tanaka chooses an electric toothbrush.

421
00:15:38,660 --> 00:15:39,260
Electric brush?

422
00:15:39,260 --> 00:15:42,140
Electric or not, he'll like it.

423
00:15:41,060 --> 00:15:42,140
He'll like it, right?

424
00:15:42,140 --> 00:15:43,900
Who doesn't like brushing his teeth?

425
00:15:58,080 --> 00:15:59,500
Come on!

426
00:16:00,140 --> 00:16:00,960
Get it!

427
00:16:02,380 --> 00:16:03,880
Yes, it's electric.

428
00:16:05,160 --> 00:16:06,440
Just scoot it in.

429
00:16:06,440 --> 00:16:08,080
Bring it home.

430
00:16:08,080 --> 00:16:10,080
Just take that with you.

431
00:16:10,080 --> 00:16:11,420
Drag it in.

432
00:16:12,220 --> 00:16:13,160
It's electric.

433
00:16:14,920 --> 00:16:16,960
Hurry the hell up!

434
00:16:16,960 --> 00:16:18,200
Don't discourage him!

435
00:16:18,200 --> 00:16:20,200
Hamada-san!

436
00:16:21,400 --> 00:16:24,280
You knew he'd retract once you hit him!?

437
00:16:24,280 --> 00:16:26,240
We don't have all day here.

438
00:16:26,600 --> 00:16:28,540
But he went away because you hit him!

439
00:16:28,540 --> 00:16:30,880
Maybe he just didn't want it.

440
00:16:30,880 --> 00:16:33,080
Right, he didn't like it from the get go.

441
00:16:33,080 --> 00:16:33,960
I agree!

442
00:16:33,960 --> 00:16:36,440
Well, can we ask him why he left?

443
00:16:36,440 --> 00:16:38,720
Could you tell us why?

444
00:16:38,920 --> 00:16:42,900
Because I was physically violated.

445
00:16:42,100 --> 00:16:44,560
Hamada-san...

446
00:16:42,900 --> 00:16:44,560
So it was Hamada-san...

447
00:16:44,560 --> 00:16:47,700
It makes no sense!

448
00:16:46,540 --> 00:16:47,700
Otherwise, he would have taken it.

449
00:16:47,700 --> 00:16:48,580
And here come the slap.

450
00:16:48,700 --> 00:16:51,380
Hamada slaps Tanaka.

451
00:16:51,740 --> 00:16:53,260
Let's make it quick.

452
00:16:53,260 --> 00:16:54,000
Go easy on me.

453
00:16:54,000 --> 00:16:56,000
Don't worry, I'll go easy.

454
00:16:56,100 --> 00:16:57,700
Slap him using bad aim.

455
00:16:57,700 --> 00:17:01,820
Slap him using bad aim.

456
00:17:01,820 --> 00:17:02,800
Bad aim?

457
00:17:02,800 --> 00:17:03,780
Not good.

458
00:17:04,500 --> 00:17:05,900
So not directly on the cheek?

459
00:17:06,440 --> 00:17:07,340
He could get hurt.

460
00:17:07,820 --> 00:17:08,840
So hit me over here?

461
00:17:09,260 --> 00:17:11,500
Like towards the back of my head and stuff?

462
00:17:12,720 --> 00:17:15,220
What if I just graze your face?

463
00:17:15,300 --> 00:17:17,220
That's bad aim.

464
00:17:17,220 --> 00:17:18,580
It'll hurt either way.

465
00:17:18,580 --> 00:17:19,980
So that's how it is.

466
00:17:19,980 --> 00:17:23,610
He's looking.

467
00:17:21,780 --> 00:17:23,610
He gets shy once we look at him though.

468
00:17:23,610 --> 00:17:24,540
Ready?

469
00:17:28,920 --> 00:17:31,420
That's the painful type.

470
00:17:33,820 --> 00:17:35,040
What do you want from me?!

471
00:17:35,050 --> 00:17:37,050
That's what I was told to do!

472
00:17:37,050 --> 00:17:38,200
You did that perfectly.

473
00:17:38,200 --> 00:17:39,540
Right!

474
00:17:39,540 --> 00:17:40,860
It was a badly aimed face slap.

475
00:17:41,620 --> 00:17:42,260
Your turn, Yama-chan.

476
00:17:42,260 --> 00:17:45,920
Can I choose pork buns?

477
00:17:44,320 --> 00:17:45,900
No, I don't think so.

478
00:17:45,900 --> 00:17:47,040
Why not?!

479
00:17:47,040 --> 00:17:49,660
It's my turn, and I get to choose!

480
00:17:49,660 --> 00:17:51,600
You can't offer him that.

481
00:17:51,600 --> 00:17:53,820
Nonsense! This is a game!

482
00:17:53,820 --> 00:17:55,820
Of course, he'll like this.

483
00:17:55,820 --> 00:17:58,450
Well, there's no guarantee.

484
00:17:57,150 --> 00:17:58,450
He can choose what he wants.

485
00:17:58,450 --> 00:17:58,880
Thank you.

486
00:17:59,220 --> 00:18:03,500
How about the pork bun loved by all Osaka people?

487
00:18:03,500 --> 00:18:05,580
Here they are.

488
00:18:10,480 --> 00:18:11,900
Pork buns...

489
00:18:12,080 --> 00:18:13,300
He can talk now?!

490
00:18:13,300 --> 00:18:14,420
I did it!

491
00:18:14,420 --> 00:18:15,400
He definitely likes them!

492
00:18:15,400 --> 00:18:17,020
He even said "pork buns".

493
00:18:17,020 --> 00:18:18,840
He'll definitely take it.

494
00:18:19,620 --> 00:18:21,040
Looking good.

495
00:18:21,040 --> 00:18:22,380
He opened it!

496
00:18:23,640 --> 00:18:25,500
I don't want this right now.

497
00:18:25,500 --> 00:18:27,100
I don't want this right now.

498
00:18:27,100 --> 00:18:29,060
He can talk now.

499
00:18:31,520 --> 00:18:34,490
See?
He doesn't want this right now.

500
00:18:34,500 --> 00:18:37,760
From Hamada...

501
00:18:37,760 --> 00:18:38,960
No way...

502
00:18:39,720 --> 00:18:42,940
This is so rigged!

503
00:18:43,260 --> 00:18:45,720
What?
I got slapped too!!

504
00:18:45,720 --> 00:18:49,420
He seems to have changed the rules of the game.

505
00:18:50,400 --> 00:18:54,040
He didn't say what I'm supposed to do to you.

506
00:18:55,840 --> 00:18:58,080
Hamada will do a front kick.

507
00:18:58,080 --> 00:19:01,100
Hamada will do a front kick.

508
00:19:04,100 --> 00:19:06,800
Wait, this show took a weird turn just now.

509
00:19:05,760 --> 00:19:06,780
Agreed.

510
00:19:06,920 --> 00:19:08,160
What happened?

511
00:19:08,340 --> 00:19:09,980
It didn't start this way...

512
00:19:09,980 --> 00:19:11,320
Why a kick?

513
00:19:11,320 --> 00:19:13,320
Why should we even participate?

514
00:19:13,400 --> 00:19:16,300
Seriously, why are we putting ourselves through this?

515
00:19:17,850 --> 00:19:20,700
He won't miss this...

516
00:19:20,700 --> 00:19:23,120
Isn't the way he hides so annoying?

517
00:19:23,360 --> 00:19:24,830
I'm terrified.

518
00:19:24,830 --> 00:19:26,140
A frontal kick sounds...

519
00:19:26,140 --> 00:19:27,940
...it sounds scary!

520
00:19:27,940 --> 00:19:28,920
Seriously...

521
00:19:29,200 --> 00:19:30,280
Ready?

522
00:19:37,800 --> 00:19:40,600
Stomp on his leg.

523
00:19:39,300 --> 00:19:40,600
Stomp on his leg?

524
00:19:40,600 --> 00:19:42,300
No, no, no, no!

525
00:19:44,960 --> 00:19:47,800
Ouch, ouch, ouch!

526
00:19:49,900 --> 00:19:50,840
He's looking!

527
00:19:50,840 --> 00:19:52,000
He did!

528
00:19:52,660 --> 00:19:56,240
That's good.

529
00:19:56,240 --> 00:19:57,700
That's good.

530
00:19:58,360 --> 00:19:59,540
I'm done with this...

531
00:19:59,540 --> 00:20:01,480
I don't want to play anymore...

532
00:20:01,800 --> 00:20:07,940
A surprise ending in the final attack!

533
00:20:08,700 --> 00:20:09,920
Let's do the last item.

534
00:20:10,380 --> 00:20:11,400
OK.

535
00:20:11,400 --> 00:20:13,000
Well...

536
00:20:14,100 --> 00:20:15,600
This is perfect, right?

537
00:20:15,600 --> 00:20:16,960
Ultra-man figurine collection.

538
00:20:17,100 --> 00:20:18,020
Let's do this.

539
00:20:18,740 --> 00:20:19,700
This is good.

540
00:20:19,700 --> 00:20:23,040
As long as he uses his preference to judge this.

541
00:20:23,040 --> 00:20:25,700
Look, he's not even hiding anymore.

542
00:20:25,880 --> 00:20:27,460
Please, take a good look.

543
00:20:27,460 --> 00:20:29,460
Tell us whether you like this or not.

544
00:20:29,460 --> 00:20:31,460
We got the full set.

545
00:20:31,520 --> 00:20:32,640
I think...

546
00:20:32,640 --> 00:20:34,300
I think we got him with these.

547
00:20:39,040 --> 00:20:41,080
Well...

548
00:20:41,340 --> 00:20:44,660
I can see his elbows now.

549
00:20:44,780 --> 00:20:47,700
I'm not a fan after this generation...

550
00:20:47,700 --> 00:20:49,400
I understand but...

551
00:20:49,460 --> 00:20:54,100
I'm only know the ones up to this point...

552
00:20:54,140 --> 00:20:56,140
But here are Ace and Seven...

553
00:20:56,140 --> 00:21:01,160
I didn't watch much of the Ace series...

554
00:21:02,000 --> 00:21:03,520
I've got a good feeling...

555
00:21:04,420 --> 00:21:05,720
He'll accept these!

556
00:21:06,240 --> 00:21:07,580
What's up with him now?

557
00:21:11,640 --> 00:21:14,060
OK, he's swimming...

558
00:21:17,640 --> 00:21:21,240
Maybe the Ultra-man Seven?

559
00:21:23,100 --> 00:21:25,360
Well, he grabbed the Seven...

560
00:21:25,370 --> 00:21:28,120
OK, got him, let's go home.

561
00:21:26,010 --> 00:21:27,080
He likes it then.

562
00:21:27,080 --> 00:21:28,120
We're done.

563
00:21:28,120 --> 00:21:29,180
Let's go home.

564
00:21:29,180 --> 00:21:30,140
He liked it.

565
00:21:30,440 --> 00:21:32,900
Wait a sec...

566
00:21:34,700 --> 00:21:38,180
There's a little more left...

567
00:21:39,400 --> 00:21:42,840
See you next week!!!

568
00:21:43,120 --> 00:21:44,550
What's he saying?

569
00:21:44,560 --> 00:21:48,210
Same time, same place next week!!!

570
00:21:48,220 --> 00:21:49,660
Let's end this.

571
00:21:50,450 --> 00:21:53,100
I'm not kidding!!!

572
00:21:58,120 --> 00:21:59,500
Has your physical endurance gone down?

573
00:22:00,300 --> 00:22:03,280
Endurance... Yeah, it's gone completely down.

574
00:22:03,280 --> 00:22:05,000
Oh, but Endo's hasn't, right?

575
00:22:05,000 --> 00:22:08,590
Has it gone down? Well, normally...

576
00:22:08,590 --> 00:22:10,940
So let's say running a 100 meter sprint...

577
00:22:10,940 --> 00:22:12,840
...my recovery has really...

578
00:22:12,840 --> 00:22:15,940
Speaking honestly here, Matsumoto-san,

579
00:22:15,940 --> 00:22:18,940
If I ran 100 meters with everything I got, I'll seriously vomit.

580
00:22:19,240 --> 00:22:20,940
No, I don't think so, I wouldn't vomit.

581
00:22:21,420 --> 00:22:24,220
Really? I would vomit. A long time ago...

582
00:22:24,220 --> 00:22:27,420
Actually, to tell the truth, I haven't vomited that much in my life.

583
00:22:28,740 --> 00:22:30,540
Oh wait, no, I have. Never mind.

584
00:22:32,900 --> 00:22:34,560
Right?

585
00:22:33,600 --> 00:22:35,700
I've thrown up a lot.

586
00:22:34,560 --> 00:22:36,920
Why would you lie about something so dumb?

587
00:22:36,920 --> 00:22:39,220
I thought, "I have to show off."

588
00:22:40,880 --> 00:22:43,540
"Can't miss his chance to show off!" is what I thought.

589
00:22:43,540 --> 00:22:46,340
I've thrown up a lot. I've thrown up from motion sickness a lot.

590
00:22:47,760 --> 00:22:50,120
Motion sickness?

591
00:22:50,120 --> 00:22:52,120
I've thrown up as much as the Merlion.

592
00:22:50,120 --> 00:22:52,120
T/N: He's referring to the famous Merlion fountain in Singapore that shoots water out of its mouth.

593
00:22:55,680 --> 00:22:58,660
First of all, diarrhea... You get diarrhea a lot, don't you?

594
00:22:58,660 --> 00:23:00,480
I don't even understand the meaning of diarrhea.

595
00:23:00,480 --> 00:23:03,000
So my answer would be...

596
00:23:01,480 --> 00:23:03,000
You're a defective product.

597
00:23:03,000 --> 00:23:07,280
If we were in a factory, getting ready for shipment, you'd be removed!

598
00:23:07,280 --> 00:23:09,880
They'd look at you and take you aside.

599
00:23:10,200 --> 00:23:11,880
In a really nasty box.

600
00:23:11,880 --> 00:23:13,380
That's enough!

601
00:23:15,220 --> 00:23:18,180
My answer would be, I'm not backed up.

602
00:23:18,180 --> 00:23:20,340
Well, constipation isn't good...

603
00:23:20,340 --> 00:23:23,860
Everything comes out of me so my insides are clean.

604
00:23:24,380 --> 00:23:27,680
But as a living organism, you're a ***.

605
00:23:28,820 --> 00:23:31,100
As a living organism, ***...

606
00:23:31,100 --> 00:23:37,240
Diarrhea, people who get stomach aches, people who can't eat hot foods, I hate them.

607
00:23:37,240 --> 00:23:39,660
"I can't eat foods that are too hot!"

608
00:23:39,660 --> 00:23:41,660
Who the hell are you?!

609
00:23:41,660 --> 00:23:44,640
There are so many foods that are so good when served hot.

610
00:23:44,640 --> 00:23:49,300
"I can't eat it because it's too hot" really pisses me off!

611
00:23:49,300 --> 00:23:52,600
Well, if I can say something, I'm very delicate.

612
00:23:52,600 --> 00:23:54,680
I'm a sensitive living being.

613
00:23:57,420 --> 00:23:59,700
Sensitive living being... What do you mean?

614
00:24:00,560 --> 00:24:03,400
T/N: Senpai is someone who is older or more experienced so they should be treated with respect by their kohai who are younger or less experienced.

615
00:24:00,560 --> 00:24:03,400
Uh... Who is the senpai and kohai here?
