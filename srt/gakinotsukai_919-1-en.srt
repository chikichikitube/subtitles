1
00:00:01,000 --> 00:00:02,530
What are we doing today?

2
00:00:02,900 --> 00:00:03,700
Well...

3
00:00:04,470 --> 00:00:05,900
I have some sad news

4
00:00:06,870 --> 00:00:07,670
You see, today...

5
00:00:08,330 --> 00:00:11,370
We have Murakami Shoji's... Not again...

6
00:00:11,400 --> 00:00:14,100
We already had enough of him

7
00:00:14,700 --> 00:00:15,730
We must go outside

8
00:00:16,330 --> 00:00:18,270
It's always on the outside

9
00:00:18,670 --> 00:00:19,930
What are we doing? Today is a...

10
00:00:20,270 --> 00:00:21,300
Geisha (Maiko) Class

11
00:00:21,370 --> 00:00:22,930
Our ratings will slump again!

12
00:00:24,630 --> 00:00:26,130
Tanaka, don't you have a car?

13
00:00:26,300 --> 00:00:27,070
Yes, a Volvo

14
00:00:27,060 --> 00:00:28,330
Can you take us away?

15
00:00:31,400 --> 00:00:33,530
No wonder the Five don't like it

16
00:00:33,670 --> 00:00:38,060
A series of six Murakami Shoji's classrooms has been held so far

17
00:00:38,470 --> 00:00:41,000
Shoji himself divides the schedule on his own

18
00:00:41,000 --> 00:00:43,230
And calls up members to do whatever he wants

19
00:00:43,630 --> 00:00:45,700
And when you have low raitings on top of that

20
00:00:45,700 --> 00:00:47,370
It's just too much

21
00:00:48,530 --> 00:00:51,060
FROM WHICH ANGLE DOES IT LOOK LIKE A WASHING MACHINE!?

22
00:00:51,730 --> 00:00:54,060
I'M ASKING YOU, FROM WHICH ANGLE?

23
00:00:59,630 --> 00:01:01,630
We do it too often

24
00:01:01,910 --> 00:01:01,950
I think we really need to go to Shochiku (Video distribution company)

25
00:01:04,030 --> 00:01:06,630
Taki Akira (Shoji's mentor) wouldn't be pleased

26
00:01:10,970 --> 00:01:12,900
We have no other choice, but to do it

27
00:01:14,330 --> 00:01:16,100
But before that

28
00:01:16,530 --> 00:01:17,230
we have a guest

29
00:01:17,230 --> 00:01:18,230
That's quite rare

30
00:01:18,370 --> 00:01:19,730
We rarely have any guests

31
00:01:19,730 --> 00:01:21,100
That's really seldom

32
00:01:22,930 --> 00:01:24,430
"Toshiaki Karasawa"

33
00:01:24,430 --> 00:01:26,070
That's so dirty...

34
00:01:26,060 --> 00:01:28,000
I'm here to boost the ratings!

35
00:01:30,560 --> 00:01:31,800
He has it, no way

36
00:01:32,070 --> 00:01:33,470
Why do they always have to do it

37
00:01:37,070 --> 00:01:39,600
Why can't he just come in empty-handed?

38
00:01:40,400 --> 00:01:42,370
One has to do it in a midst of our show

39
00:01:43,330 --> 00:01:46,000
Well, I'm sorry to interrupt, but I have to advertise

40
00:01:46,000 --> 00:01:47,970
20th Century Boys from 30 August

41
00:01:48,400 --> 00:01:50,560
The film is being screened to great acclaim!

42
00:01:50,570 --> 00:01:52,400
This is the masterpiece

43
00:01:52,470 --> 00:01:53,770
Please, dear Gaki viewers

44
00:01:54,100 --> 00:01:55,430
Make sure you'll watch it!

45
00:01:55,470 --> 00:01:56,570
See you in theaters!

46
00:02:01,000 --> 00:02:02,270
The budget is 6 billion yen

47
00:02:03,530 --> 00:02:06,290
My character performance alone costs 5,3 billion

48
00:02:06,970 --> 00:02:07,930
Are you for real?

49
00:02:08,530 --> 00:02:09,630
We had no idea

50
00:02:13,030 --> 00:02:14,530
Alright, Karasawa, shall we go?

51
00:02:15,400 --> 00:02:17,460
We're going to meet big brother Shoji

52
00:02:19,570 --> 00:02:21,170
Everyone has to wear it. What's that?

53
00:02:21,300 --> 00:02:22,330
We're doing Maiko

54
00:02:22,330 --> 00:02:23,730
It seems to be a Maiko class

55
00:02:24,000 --> 00:02:26,860
Although, we hate doing it each time, he still calls us

56
00:02:27,070 --> 00:02:29,530
You've come all that way here, so let's go with us

57
00:02:32,670 --> 00:02:35,000
Once you're hooked, this guy will never leave you

58
00:02:37,700 --> 00:02:39,800
And so, Karasawa Toshiaki

59
00:02:40,200 --> 00:02:42,430
was decided to take part in Maiko class!!

60
00:02:55,870 --> 00:02:56,670
You look great

61
00:02:57,570 --> 00:02:58,570
Doesn't he?

62
00:02:59,400 --> 00:03:01,560
He's more determined than I thought

63
00:03:01,770 --> 00:03:03,230
At all...I knew that after all

64
00:03:03,230 --> 00:03:04,400
Our master isn't here yet

65
00:03:06,570 --> 00:03:07,370
A shrine

66
00:03:07,870 --> 00:03:09,150
Look, there's something written

67
00:03:11,660 --> 00:03:15,700
"Gather here for the Maiko class!!"

68
00:03:15,930 --> 00:03:18,360
It's like he wants us to come over

69
00:03:18,430 --> 00:03:19,800
That's true

70
00:03:21,130 --> 00:03:22,970
Shouldn't we have a tatami room?

71
00:03:23,530 --> 00:03:24,770
He can't even organize it!

72
00:03:25,000 --> 00:03:27,360
There's someone on the bike

73
00:03:27,490 --> 00:03:30,370
Greetings!

74
00:03:31,690 --> 00:03:34,490
He's so scary...

75
00:03:34,690 --> 00:03:36,290
I'm scared...

76
00:03:37,890 --> 00:03:41,990
The landlady just asked me to buy some dried tofu

77
00:03:43,290 --> 00:03:45,290
What a coincidence to meet you here!

78
00:03:46,030 --> 00:03:48,430
Good morning!

79
00:03:48,570 --> 00:03:49,370
Good morning

80
00:03:51,000 --> 00:03:52,770
Despite the members' feelings, the one

81
00:03:52,770 --> 00:03:54,700
who dashingly appeared on stage was

82
00:03:54,770 --> 00:03:55,930
Murakami Shoji

83
00:03:56,800 --> 00:03:57,600
Big brother

84
00:03:58,330 --> 00:04:01,160
I don't think Maiko training should be done outside?

85
00:04:01,500 --> 00:04:02,570
You're, this time

86
00:04:02,930 --> 00:04:04,100
your brother

87
00:04:04,100 --> 00:04:05,660
WHO'S A BIG BROTHER HERE!?

88
00:04:07,300 --> 00:04:08,800
I AM YOUR OLDER SISTER!

89
00:04:09,500 --> 00:04:10,300
We see

90
00:04:10,800 --> 00:04:13,200
Because you're Maiko san

91
00:04:13,930 --> 00:04:15,700
You're just incessantly whining

92
00:04:16,900 --> 00:04:20,390
I guess because you're always too much physically in pain?

93
00:04:24,430 --> 00:04:25,230
This time

94
00:04:25,900 --> 00:04:27,130
We're doing Maiko class

95
00:04:28,830 --> 00:04:30,000
We're sorry, sister

96
00:04:30,970 --> 00:04:33,030
This time we have one more student

97
00:04:33,470 --> 00:04:34,570
Is that so?

98
00:04:36,500 --> 00:04:37,300
Karasawa?

99
00:04:39,700 --> 00:04:41,530
Your sister didn't know about this

100
00:04:42,530 --> 00:04:43,330
Thank you so much

101
00:04:43,500 --> 00:04:44,300
Take it

102
00:04:44,330 --> 00:04:45,130
Thank you very much

103
00:04:45,500 --> 00:04:47,130
"Soyo Kaze" (gentle breeze)

104
00:04:47,500 --> 00:04:48,930
Sister's name?

105
00:04:50,000 --> 00:04:52,230
Soyo Kaze?

106
00:04:52,230 --> 00:04:54,830
In order to sell well

107
00:04:55,030 --> 00:04:56,430
I have them named

108
00:04:57,030 --> 00:04:57,830
And in the back

109
00:04:58,370 --> 00:04:59,170
That's great!

110
00:04:59,300 --> 00:05:00,100
That's right

111
00:05:00,570 --> 00:05:01,330
What's that?

112
00:05:01,330 --> 00:05:02,130
Well, that's

113
00:05:02,530 --> 00:05:05,330
"what the hell is this?" That was my chief's advice

114
00:05:07,400 --> 00:05:08,200
You see?

115
00:05:08,400 --> 00:05:09,200
I guess so

116
00:05:09,630 --> 00:05:10,970
Sister, let's work hard today!

117
00:05:11,370 --> 00:05:13,370
Yes. Listen, you

118
00:05:13,530 --> 00:05:15,790
Karasawa works in theaters, right?

119
00:05:17,330 --> 00:05:18,730
That will be quite special

120
00:05:19,470 --> 00:05:21,260
What if a person don't want to do it?

121
00:05:21,500 --> 00:05:22,300
Go home!

122
00:05:23,370 --> 00:05:25,730
GET THE HELL OUT OF PONTOCHO!(geisha district)

123
00:05:26,600 --> 00:05:27,730
"GET OUT OF PONTOCHO!"

124
00:05:29,170 --> 00:05:29,970
Excuse me

125
00:05:30,470 --> 00:05:32,660
I am sorry that Yamasaki san told me to say it

126
00:05:33,670 --> 00:05:34,700
Right? Yama chan

127
00:05:34,870 --> 00:05:35,670
Wait...

128
00:05:37,030 --> 00:05:41,460
Your father was permanently banned from Gion (geisha district)

129
00:05:41,930 --> 00:05:43,790
And you haven't heard anything about it?

130
00:05:46,330 --> 00:05:47,200
He's so incoherent

131
00:05:48,800 --> 00:05:51,700
He pulled maiko's hair

132
00:05:53,430 --> 00:05:55,880
And ran away with Kyoto vegetables

133
00:05:56,830 --> 00:06:00,760
I wonder if his dirty behavior led to him being reported

134
00:06:02,170 --> 00:06:04,960
Usually, maiko have fans with them

135
00:06:05,330 --> 00:06:06,300
We see

136
00:06:07,000 --> 00:06:08,300
A special tool

137
00:06:08,870 --> 00:06:09,970
to make one look sexy

138
00:06:10,400 --> 00:06:11,200
Thank you

139
00:06:11,970 --> 00:06:12,870
You'll be Hamayako

140
00:06:13,030 --> 00:06:13,970
Thank you very much!

141
00:06:14,370 --> 00:06:15,070
You're Enyako

142
00:06:15,070 --> 00:06:16,030
Thank you very much!

143
00:06:18,470 --> 00:06:19,270
You're Matsuyako

144
00:06:20,130 --> 00:06:20,930
And

145
00:06:21,270 --> 00:06:22,230
And you'll be...

146
00:06:23,000 --> 00:06:23,800
Tayan

147
00:06:25,200 --> 00:06:27,060
No, let's go with Tayako

148
00:06:27,170 --> 00:06:28,130
And also...

149
00:06:28,270 --> 00:06:29,660
Because you're a newcomer

150
00:06:30,200 --> 00:06:33,000
I didn't expect you coming today, so this is the only one left

151
00:06:33,270 --> 00:06:34,670
But that should do well

152
00:06:34,930 --> 00:06:36,300
I really didn't know

153
00:06:36,370 --> 00:06:37,930
Fine? Excuse me, sister?

154
00:06:38,030 --> 00:06:39,270
I don't have anything

155
00:06:40,030 --> 00:06:40,830
What?

156
00:06:41,130 --> 00:06:41,930
I have nothing

157
00:06:42,430 --> 00:06:43,830
Do you want one?

158
00:06:43,830 --> 00:06:44,430
Yes

159
00:06:45,330 --> 00:06:46,930
Follow me

160
00:06:47,600 --> 00:06:49,200
Follow me, I'll give you something

161
00:06:50,600 --> 00:06:53,200
Don't you want it? He wants it!

162
00:07:03,270 --> 00:07:07,890
He gave him a drawer instead of a fan? He definitely made a mistake (sensu tansu sound similar)

163
00:07:07,970 --> 00:07:10,030
He definitely messed it up

164
00:07:10,430 --> 00:07:11,400
It's quite heavy

165
00:07:12,300 --> 00:07:13,730
I think it's a wardrobe

166
00:07:15,870 --> 00:07:16,670
What's that?

167
00:07:17,070 --> 00:07:18,200
I think it's a wardrobe

168
00:07:20,400 --> 00:07:23,130
Where are the tanks and the drawers like this?

169
00:07:24,330 --> 00:07:26,960
All sorts of things can be stored here

170
00:07:27,770 --> 00:07:30,590
Like this, you see, there's this drawer with two tiers

171
00:07:30,900 --> 00:07:32,000
It's a wardrobe indeed

172
00:07:38,530 --> 00:07:41,260
Maiko's basic skill are precise measurements

173
00:07:41,470 --> 00:07:44,430
Finally, the practice begins in the tatami room

174
00:07:47,830 --> 00:07:48,630
Right now

175
00:07:48,830 --> 00:07:52,730
Don't you think it's a bit to early for a tatami room practice for you?

176
00:07:53,100 --> 00:07:53,900
Matsuyako

177
00:07:55,600 --> 00:07:58,400
What kind of maiko do you want to be?

178
00:07:58,770 --> 00:08:02,360
Well, I want to be a maiko who is loved by everyone

179
00:08:02,360 --> 00:08:03,290
You're wrong!

180
00:08:04,900 --> 00:08:07,890
You want to be a skilled maiko!

181
00:08:08,770 --> 00:08:09,530
I'm sorry

182
00:08:09,530 --> 00:08:11,870
Actually I (washi sounds like I, but means paper)...

183
00:08:14,170 --> 00:08:16,630
Why did you say washi?

184
00:08:16,630 --> 00:08:19,100
I'll act like a head of the company

185
00:08:19,430 --> 00:08:21,270
Okay? Endo

186
00:08:22,430 --> 00:08:28,730
Why Endo? You really need him? Didn't you need Matsuyako?

187
00:08:35,030 --> 00:08:38,530
What is your name? My name is Enyako

188
00:08:38,530 --> 00:08:40,830
Could you fill it up? One moment

189
00:08:41,700 --> 00:08:42,500
Watch carefully!

190
00:08:43,930 --> 00:08:47,300
That's impressive! That's how one shall open a bottle!

191
00:08:47,470 --> 00:08:49,130
This is not a pub

192
00:08:50,430 --> 00:08:51,500
You're really good

193
00:08:57,500 --> 00:09:00,100
The fact that it's done without teaching

194
00:09:00,100 --> 00:09:00,900
Is awesome!

195
00:09:01,500 --> 00:09:02,300
Thank you very much!

196
00:09:03,100 --> 00:09:03,900
Hamada!

197
00:09:04,270 --> 00:09:05,070
Your turn

198
00:09:08,070 --> 00:09:08,870
Do your best!

199
00:09:08,930 --> 00:09:10,430
You're quite a nice girl

200
00:09:10,600 --> 00:09:11,800
Will you fill up my glass?

201
00:09:32,800 --> 00:09:35,160
What the hell is that faltering way of pouring?

202
00:09:36,000 --> 00:09:37,900
But that's such a tiny cup

203
00:09:38,000 --> 00:09:41,200
Chief wants to have a full cup

204
00:09:41,200 --> 00:09:45,500
How can you do it with such faltering before a chief?

205
00:09:47,200 --> 00:09:48,400
What the?

206
00:09:49,930 --> 00:09:50,570
That's

207
00:09:50,570 --> 00:09:53,100
Don't say things like "what the?"

208
00:09:54,500 --> 00:09:55,600
It's a rule

209
00:09:56,970 --> 00:09:58,330
Yamasaki! Yes!

210
00:09:58,900 --> 00:10:00,630
Can you do it? Absolutely!

211
00:10:01,030 --> 00:10:01,830
Alrighty

212
00:10:05,530 --> 00:10:06,330
That's yours

213
00:10:10,060 --> 00:10:11,160
Stand up for a minute

214
00:10:13,630 --> 00:10:14,430
Stand up

215
00:10:14,430 --> 00:10:17,330
There are people who love this kind of thing

216
00:10:20,670 --> 00:10:21,830
Wait a moment...

217
00:10:24,430 --> 00:10:25,570
Do you have more beer?

218
00:10:26,100 --> 00:10:27,100
Come here

219
00:10:27,130 --> 00:10:27,930
Yes

220
00:10:28,170 --> 00:10:29,170
I'm sorry

221
00:10:29,330 --> 00:10:30,130
I'm back

222
00:10:37,730 --> 00:10:38,530
Look

223
00:10:39,570 --> 00:10:42,230
I can't do it. It's way different from others

224
00:10:43,170 --> 00:10:46,030
Today's girl is full of excuses...

225
00:10:47,270 --> 00:10:48,470
If it's hot, it's hot

226
00:10:49,470 --> 00:10:50,700
If it's cold, it's cold

227
00:10:51,830 --> 00:10:54,670
It's hot for African children each year

228
00:10:57,230 --> 00:10:59,120
How many seasonal words

229
00:10:59,300 --> 00:11:02,200
do Japanese people have?

230
00:11:09,870 --> 00:11:10,670
Let's move on

231
00:11:10,660 --> 00:11:12,460
He's done

232
00:11:15,230 --> 00:11:18,100
These days, there are calls for cost reductions

233
00:11:18,330 --> 00:11:20,130
Transporting food is also

234
00:11:20,130 --> 00:11:21,870
maiko's important job

235
00:11:22,870 --> 00:11:24,630
These are food smaples

236
00:11:25,400 --> 00:11:26,200
Here

237
00:11:27,030 --> 00:11:31,130
That's every chief's favorite full-course meal

238
00:11:31,130 --> 00:11:32,430
It's quite simple

239
00:11:34,200 --> 00:11:36,730
It looks like breakfast... Simple?

240
00:11:37,800 --> 00:11:40,500
Can you say that to a dead soldier?

241
00:11:41,800 --> 00:11:43,100
He wouldn't be able to eat it

242
00:11:45,100 --> 00:11:48,630
The distance to the tatami room where the food is served is 20 meters

243
00:11:49,900 --> 00:11:53,860
The first step is to finish off the dish with a deftly arranged salad

244
00:11:55,370 --> 00:11:57,670
Quickly cross the plank

245
00:11:58,030 --> 00:12:02,530
And have a quick bite to eat before getting to the tatami room

246
00:12:03,430 --> 00:12:05,530
Sliding down the slide at the end

247
00:12:05,530 --> 00:12:07,530
And deliver it to the tatami room

248
00:12:08,930 --> 00:12:13,090
The boss is tired from overwork and is hungry

249
00:12:13,230 --> 00:12:14,530
If don't bring it to him soon

250
00:12:14,930 --> 00:12:16,500
He'll look like a demon

251
00:12:17,970 --> 00:12:19,970
Hamayako tries first

252
00:12:22,370 --> 00:12:25,730
Sister and other members are waiting by the table

253
00:12:27,270 --> 00:12:28,070
Ready!

254
00:12:28,830 --> 00:12:29,630
Steady!

255
00:12:30,700 --> 00:12:31,500
Go!

256
00:12:32,170 --> 00:12:33,530
Go for it!

257
00:12:35,370 --> 00:12:37,130
Hamayako, go for it! So fast!

258
00:12:38,300 --> 00:12:40,400
Hurry up!

259
00:12:50,000 --> 00:12:51,300
Bite that bun

260
00:12:54,600 --> 00:12:56,500
Hamayako, you've lost your head...

261
00:12:59,530 --> 00:13:00,570
Should be fine

262
00:13:00,800 --> 00:13:03,100
50 seconds left...

263
00:13:04,000 --> 00:13:05,330
Hamayako!

264
00:13:09,000 --> 00:13:13,000
Hamayako, are you alright?

265
00:13:16,400 --> 00:13:18,700
That's too fucking slippery!

266
00:13:47,530 --> 00:13:49,500
Thank God, I was a spectator

267
00:13:52,500 --> 00:13:53,300
Let's move on

268
00:13:53,300 --> 00:13:55,000
Karayako!

269
00:13:56,300 --> 00:14:03,000
Do your best! Be careful!

270
00:14:16,500 --> 00:14:18,760
You don't do such things in the films

271
00:14:23,530 --> 00:14:26,330
Go over the Shijo Bridge (in Kyoto)!

272
00:14:29,930 --> 00:14:31,070
That's good

273
00:14:36,900 --> 00:14:38,870
Do it carefully!

274
00:14:44,570 --> 00:14:45,570
Karayako, are you fine?

275
00:14:48,370 --> 00:14:49,170
That was awesome!

276
00:14:51,000 --> 00:14:53,670
That was perfect!

277
00:14:55,270 --> 00:14:56,830
You really flew...

278
00:14:58,560 --> 00:14:59,990
My ass hurts...

279
00:15:20,930 --> 00:15:22,470
Sorry for the wait

280
00:15:23,670 --> 00:15:24,470
You passed!

281
00:15:26,100 --> 00:15:27,800
Karayako, you're great!

282
00:15:28,030 --> 00:15:29,560
Compared to you, Hamayako

283
00:15:29,600 --> 00:15:30,400
I'm sorry

284
00:15:31,230 --> 00:15:32,230
Look at you...

285
00:15:34,370 --> 00:15:37,900
With the way you did it, you'll never be invited to the tatami room!

286
00:15:37,900 --> 00:15:38,400
I'm sorry

287
00:15:38,400 --> 00:15:39,430
I will do my best!

288
00:15:39,430 --> 00:15:40,600
Don't bullshit me!

289
00:15:41,600 --> 00:15:42,470
You're punished!

290
00:15:47,530 --> 00:15:48,830
I'll be wearing these

291
00:15:51,700 --> 00:15:52,500
No, no, no

292
00:15:53,870 --> 00:15:57,730
If no one does anything properly, everyone will be held responsible for that

293
00:15:58,130 --> 00:15:58,930
Yes

294
00:15:59,700 --> 00:16:00,500
Next up is

295
00:16:00,670 --> 00:16:03,170
Maiko's evening practice

296
00:16:03,170 --> 00:16:05,630
which only happens if the baggage is hard

297
00:16:07,330 --> 00:16:10,160
We're maiko, which means we are virgins

298
00:16:11,200 --> 00:16:12,900
I'll be the chief

299
00:16:14,170 --> 00:16:14,970
and you guys

300
00:16:15,630 --> 00:16:17,630
will be called from the next room

301
00:16:18,200 --> 00:16:20,070
And you should be able to turn me down

302
00:16:20,730 --> 00:16:25,230
The chief played in many places

303
00:16:26,030 --> 00:16:27,500
Undercover snack bars

304
00:16:28,470 --> 00:16:29,570
Cabaret clubs

305
00:16:30,470 --> 00:16:32,130
The final place is this one

306
00:16:32,830 --> 00:16:33,830
This is the last one

307
00:16:34,800 --> 00:16:35,970
Most certainly if you

308
00:16:36,330 --> 00:16:37,300
answer in a weird way

309
00:16:37,400 --> 00:16:39,030
he'll hold you the other way round

310
00:16:39,030 --> 00:16:40,100
Alright, Matsumoto

311
00:16:40,600 --> 00:16:42,070
Turn me down

312
00:16:42,470 --> 00:16:43,270
Alright

313
00:16:44,530 --> 00:16:45,330
Do your best!

314
00:16:46,430 --> 00:16:47,830
You came, Matsuyako?

315
00:16:49,270 --> 00:16:50,600
Looks like you're used to it

316
00:16:50,600 --> 00:16:51,270
Yes!

317
00:16:51,270 --> 00:16:53,330
Just recently... I see

318
00:16:53,600 --> 00:16:54,200
Yes

319
00:16:54,200 --> 00:16:56,130
Come on, be my woman!

320
00:16:57,900 --> 00:16:59,500
I am very delighted to her that, but

321
00:17:00,500 --> 00:17:01,300
Today...

322
00:17:05,570 --> 00:17:06,370
Fine

323
00:17:06,400 --> 00:17:07,270
That doesn't matter

324
00:17:08,970 --> 00:17:11,360
Yes, but that's too embarrassing

325
00:17:11,370 --> 00:17:12,630
What are talking about?

326
00:17:13,200 --> 00:17:14,430
I'll draw you a towel

327
00:17:16,670 --> 00:17:17,470
Please, stop that!

328
00:17:18,230 --> 00:17:19,300
You can't do that!

329
00:17:19,600 --> 00:17:22,030
I don't want bath towels or anything extra

330
00:17:24,530 --> 00:17:25,370
You're so shit!

331
00:17:25,800 --> 00:17:26,470
I'm sorry!

332
00:17:26,470 --> 00:17:27,330
What was that?

333
00:17:27,500 --> 00:17:28,300
I'm sorry!

334
00:17:29,200 --> 00:17:31,960
You're doing it in a such usual way...

335
00:17:34,070 --> 00:17:36,820
Sister, what kind of refusal is the best one?

336
00:17:36,900 --> 00:17:40,390
If the president did that, you'd feel sorry for him

337
00:17:41,330 --> 00:17:42,530
Try being a boss

338
00:17:44,270 --> 00:17:45,700
I'll show how it's done

339
00:17:46,200 --> 00:17:47,070
Please!

340
00:17:48,230 --> 00:17:48,970
Excuse me

341
00:17:48,970 --> 00:17:50,430
Sorry for the interruption

342
00:17:51,770 --> 00:17:53,770
Thank you very much

343
00:17:54,000 --> 00:17:54,800
I waited for you

344
00:17:55,770 --> 00:17:56,730
What did you want?

345
00:17:56,770 --> 00:17:57,630
Well, listen

346
00:17:57,770 --> 00:17:59,030
Let's sleep together

347
00:17:59,130 --> 00:18:00,770
Please, stop this!

348
00:18:00,870 --> 00:18:01,830
Wait

349
00:18:02,430 --> 00:18:04,580
I jumped and my ribs came off

350
00:18:05,900 --> 00:18:07,400
You jumped and your ribs?

351
00:18:07,830 --> 00:18:09,600
I have a scratch on my back!

352
00:18:10,530 --> 00:18:12,000
What's with that?

353
00:18:12,300 --> 00:18:13,400
You're lying!

354
00:18:13,570 --> 00:18:14,700
I have a dirty butt

355
00:18:15,130 --> 00:18:16,230
I have a dirty butt!

356
00:18:16,330 --> 00:18:17,430
I don't care

357
00:18:17,530 --> 00:18:18,330
It's true!

358
00:18:18,700 --> 00:18:20,970
My spine is oddly rigid

359
00:18:22,830 --> 00:18:23,770
Please, stop!

360
00:18:26,170 --> 00:18:28,700
The class is coming to an end

361
00:18:28,770 --> 00:18:31,130
With a little break

362
00:18:33,600 --> 00:18:36,440
I heard you don't have to take out this watermelon's seeds

363
00:18:43,370 --> 00:18:44,570
Practice some pouring

364
00:18:49,370 --> 00:18:50,630
Try this one

365
00:18:51,030 --> 00:18:53,260
That's the revenge for what happened earlier

366
00:19:04,500 --> 00:19:05,600
Please, watch out

367
00:19:07,530 --> 00:19:08,330
That was awful

368
00:19:09,830 --> 00:19:11,460
Do you even know how to operate it?

369
00:19:12,270 --> 00:19:13,730
That's my first time

370
00:19:13,800 --> 00:19:16,830
I always poured into the cup like this

371
00:19:17,930 --> 00:19:20,350
It's not always can be like that

372
00:19:22,600 --> 00:19:23,400
Understand?

373
00:19:24,070 --> 00:19:25,470
Not really

374
00:19:29,770 --> 00:19:30,570
Tanaka

375
00:19:31,300 --> 00:19:33,830
Tell him what I want to say

376
00:19:35,900 --> 00:19:37,530
I'm not really sure

377
00:19:39,200 --> 00:19:41,310
You should be flexible, right?

378
00:19:41,500 --> 00:19:42,400
That's right

379
00:19:51,430 --> 00:19:52,200
What was that?

380
00:19:52,200 --> 00:19:55,260
It looked like a cross chop

381
00:19:55,370 --> 00:19:56,770
He made it like a cross chop

382
00:19:56,870 --> 00:19:58,030
Maiko san, what was that?

383
00:19:58,870 --> 00:19:59,800
That was a cross chop

384
00:20:01,900 --> 00:20:02,970
Do you want to leave?

385
00:20:06,670 --> 00:20:07,470
Let's get going

386
00:20:08,470 --> 00:20:11,430
Maiko must get into the tatami room

387
00:20:11,430 --> 00:20:14,200
under all circumstances

388
00:20:15,570 --> 00:20:17,030
How shall I say... In Kyoto

389
00:20:17,130 --> 00:20:18,430
It's quite cold

390
00:20:18,470 --> 00:20:19,430
And summers are hot

391
00:20:19,670 --> 00:20:21,670
Seasons are quite varying there

392
00:20:21,670 --> 00:20:23,000
There are also storms

393
00:20:23,030 --> 00:20:25,590
That's how it is

394
00:20:25,670 --> 00:20:26,700
No matter what happens

395
00:20:26,930 --> 00:20:29,700
You must get to the chief's room

396
00:20:29,700 --> 00:20:32,790
Today, I've set up a storm

397
00:20:33,330 --> 00:20:35,330
Anyone wants to go first?

398
00:20:36,570 --> 00:20:37,370
Ah, right!

399
00:20:38,270 --> 00:20:39,070
Karasawa!

400
00:20:39,230 --> 00:20:40,030
You're a newcomer

401
00:20:40,730 --> 00:20:41,530
Come here

402
00:20:42,600 --> 00:20:43,370
Karayako, good luck

403
00:20:43,370 --> 00:20:44,500
Karayako, do your best!

404
00:20:44,500 --> 00:20:45,830
Karayako newcomer

405
00:20:46,400 --> 00:20:49,460
Why don't two of us have a showdown?

406
00:20:49,770 --> 00:20:51,300
We'll do it together

407
00:20:52,230 --> 00:20:53,770
Let's do it

408
00:20:55,160 --> 00:20:56,790
MAN CATCHING SHOWDOWN!

409
00:20:56,800 --> 00:20:57,600
Okay

410
00:20:58,200 --> 00:20:59,730
Man catching showdown

411
00:21:02,870 --> 00:21:03,970
You can choose one

412
00:21:04,000 --> 00:21:05,470
out of five regulars

413
00:21:07,830 --> 00:21:09,700
Not as girls

414
00:21:09,870 --> 00:21:13,600
But as men

415
00:21:14,370 --> 00:21:15,670
As a man

416
00:21:15,700 --> 00:21:18,600
A girl won't fit for that role

417
00:21:20,300 --> 00:21:23,030
The one with the most applause wins

418
00:21:23,030 --> 00:21:24,630
The one with least loses

419
00:21:25,070 --> 00:21:27,830
The loser has to do this

420
00:21:28,630 --> 00:21:29,430
Starting with

421
00:21:31,270 --> 00:21:33,430
Who thinks that Karayako is handsome?

422
00:21:37,100 --> 00:21:37,900
That's enough

423
00:21:38,000 --> 00:21:39,470
That was okay

424
00:21:40,230 --> 00:21:41,230
Thank you

425
00:21:41,260 --> 00:21:45,730
I don't know how much will applaud

426
00:21:46,400 --> 00:21:47,200
Now

427
00:21:47,430 --> 00:21:49,470
Who think Soyo Kaze is awesome?

428
00:21:57,600 --> 00:21:58,400
I lost

429
00:22:00,770 --> 00:22:01,600
Completely

430
00:22:05,100 --> 00:22:07,900
I really hoped I could go to Thailand after all this blabbing

431
00:22:08,830 --> 00:22:09,630
At least

432
00:22:10,100 --> 00:22:11,570
I was like, can I leave already?

433
00:22:12,870 --> 00:22:15,300
Shall we start the storm?

434
00:22:16,100 --> 00:22:16,900
Yes

435
00:22:17,430 --> 00:22:18,500
You can do it

436
00:22:19,070 --> 00:22:22,760
You know how I risk my life every time I go up to the tatami room?

437
00:22:22,930 --> 00:22:24,600
I will show that

438
00:22:25,500 --> 00:22:27,330
Don't stand in front of that storm

439
00:22:27,500 --> 00:22:28,630
And you won't get hurt

440
00:22:29,770 --> 00:22:31,100
I will show you

441
00:22:31,700 --> 00:22:32,870
the real Maiko Spirit!

442
00:22:33,500 --> 00:22:34,300
Alright!

443
00:22:34,330 --> 00:22:35,130
Start!

444
00:22:42,830 --> 00:22:44,100
He's calling for me!

445
00:23:05,730 --> 00:23:07,130
He's finally here

446
00:23:07,770 --> 00:23:08,570
Give him some more

447
00:23:08,900 --> 00:23:09,700
A bit more

448
00:23:10,170 --> 00:23:12,840
Mum, that's too much shower

449
00:23:21,800 --> 00:23:22,600
Landlord

450
00:23:24,000 --> 00:23:24,970
Is there a roof?

451
00:23:29,230 --> 00:23:31,200
That was really great

452
00:23:35,970 --> 00:23:37,670
I haven't been so wet in ages...

453
00:23:40,300 --> 00:23:41,100
Let's go?

454
00:23:41,430 --> 00:23:42,230
Let's go?

455
00:23:42,230 --> 00:23:43,370
Wait

456
00:23:43,770 --> 00:23:44,570
Wait, there's

457
00:23:45,400 --> 00:23:46,830
the final part

458
00:23:47,170 --> 00:23:48,570
Do be done by our sister

459
00:23:52,570 --> 00:23:53,370
Chief...

460
00:23:55,600 --> 00:23:57,300
Are bonito (fish)

461
00:23:57,530 --> 00:23:59,300
already caught in Tosa Bay?

462
00:24:01,730 --> 00:24:02,930
What was that?
