1
00:00:00,520 --> 00:00:03,180
Once again, it's Jiji-Nuki

2
00:00:00,750 --> 00:00:06,080
Endo Shozo

3
00:00:00,750 --> 00:00:06,080
Hamada Masatoshi

4
00:00:00,750 --> 00:00:06,080
Matsumoto Hitoshi

5
00:00:00,750 --> 00:00:06,080
Tanaka Naoki

6
00:00:00,750 --> 00:00:06,080
Tsukitei Hosei

7
00:00:03,320 --> 00:00:05,180
You can tell cause of this set

8
00:00:05,180 --> 00:00:09,550
I really hate this corner, but we're doing it anyways

9
00:00:09,550 --> 00:00:11,220
Who likes doing this?

10
00:00:11,220 --> 00:00:13,280
Who likes doing this? Tanaka?

11
00:00:13,280 --> 00:00:14,920
No no no, me? Is it me?

12
00:00:14,920 --> 00:00:19,090
Facebook

13
00:00:14,920 --> 00:00:19,090
You're always posting about this on

14
00:00:19,090 --> 00:00:21,090
I'm on Facebook doing this?

15
00:00:21,090 --> 00:00:23,880
I'm posting about it?

16
00:00:21,760 --> 00:00:23,880
You really find it funny

17
00:00:23,880 --> 00:00:25,160
Jiji Nuki indeed

18
00:00:25,160 --> 00:00:27,500
There's a punishment?

19
00:00:25,860 --> 00:00:27,520
There's a punishment today

20
00:00:27,520 --> 00:00:29,210
There always is something

21
00:00:27,520 --> 00:00:29,210
What the hell man

22
00:00:30,230 --> 00:00:32,370
I've never gotten it

23
00:00:32,830 --> 00:00:40,510
Punishments received in previous Jiji-Nuki episodes

24
00:00:33,160 --> 00:00:35,070
That's true Matsumoto-san!

25
00:00:35,070 --> 00:00:38,080
My record is like perfect

26
00:00:37,280 --> 00:00:39,200
Wow

27
00:00:38,640 --> 00:00:40,510
I wonder why huh

28
00:00:40,540 --> 00:00:43,280
It's a matter of luck after all

29
00:00:43,280 --> 00:00:45,720
You know actually, this time, I'm not really,

30
00:00:45,720 --> 00:00:47,420
I'm not into doing this

31
00:00:46,480 --> 00:00:48,240
What do you mean by that?

32
00:00:47,430 --> 00:00:49,800
They're not bringing the b!tches out this time

33
00:00:50,510 --> 00:00:51,920
The Bunny girls

34
00:00:50,510 --> 00:00:51,920
you mean?

35
00:00:53,120 --> 00:00:57,140
Bunny Girls?

36
00:00:53,120 --> 00:00:57,140
You've only been doing this because of the

37
00:01:03,660 --> 00:01:04,970
Downtown no

38
00:01:03,660 --> 00:01:04,970
Gaki no Tsukai

39
00:01:03,660 --> 00:01:04,970
Ya Arahende

40
00:01:05,330 --> 00:01:07,970
Gaki Jiji-Nuki

41
00:01:05,330 --> 00:01:07,970
Presenting: Gaki Jiji-Nuki

42
00:01:08,720 --> 00:01:13,980
The cards being used will have various different original subjects on them

43
00:01:14,760 --> 00:01:19,990
Like the game Old Maid, match the cards to deplete your hand

44
00:01:20,860 --> 00:01:26,000
Whoever is left with the one unmatchable card must follow its orders

45
00:01:26,000 --> 00:01:28,700
So first, we must decide who the dealer is

46
00:01:28,700 --> 00:01:31,400
This hasn't really rotated that much

47
00:01:30,550 --> 00:01:33,240
Dealer decided by roulette

48
00:01:33,240 --> 00:01:35,010
Hosei-san will be the dealer

49
00:01:36,040 --> 00:01:44,400
And the 5 were presented with cards that have famous songs with their singers drawn on them ... What will the theme be?

50
00:01:44,400 --> 00:01:48,350
You must sing your heart out in A capella

51
00:01:48,350 --> 00:01:50,420
A capella? ...

52
00:01:48,700 --> 00:01:53,660
Sing Your Heart Out Acapella

53
00:01:50,420 --> 00:01:53,490
On the card, there are what anyone would agree are famous songs

54
00:01:53,490 --> 00:01:56,520
The one who holds the remaining card,

55
00:01:56,520 --> 00:02:02,720
Must turn to the camera and sing that song with all their heart A capella

56
00:02:02,750 --> 00:02:04,500
Doing it in a playful mocking way,

57
00:02:03,070 --> 00:02:10,540
Joker

58
00:02:03,070 --> 00:02:10,540
Kenji Sawada - Stripper

59
00:02:04,500 --> 00:02:06,750
Doing it in a playful mocking way, is totally wrong

60
00:02:06,750 --> 00:02:10,540
No impressions or anything

61
00:02:07,740 --> 00:02:10,340
No impressions at all

62
00:02:10,550 --> 00:02:13,070
Incidentally, I do have some matched up

63
00:02:11,380 --> 00:02:13,040
Yes, some are

64
00:02:15,610 --> 00:02:17,440
Ikuzo Yoshi - I'm off to Tokyo

65
00:02:15,610 --> 00:02:17,440
Pair

66
00:02:17,440 --> 00:02:19,060
Then what about this?

67
00:02:21,090 --> 00:02:23,620
Yeah, glad this one is gone

68
00:02:21,090 --> 00:02:23,750
Sera Masanori & Twist - Gun Claw

69
00:02:21,090 --> 00:02:23,760
Pair

70
00:02:23,760 --> 00:02:25,820
I have these ones too

71
00:02:26,440 --> 00:02:28,450
That's a good one to get rid of too, actually

72
00:02:28,790 --> 00:02:30,830
Pair

73
00:02:28,810 --> 00:02:30,820
Tahara Otshihiko - Embrace Tonight

74
00:02:29,410 --> 00:02:30,820
I seriously can't sing that one

75
00:02:30,820 --> 00:02:33,760
No more? Oh no more?

76
00:02:34,070 --> 00:02:36,900
"Jiji Nuki" Start

77
00:02:36,300 --> 00:02:38,300
This might be nothing

78
00:02:36,900 --> 00:04:04,990
Joker

79
00:02:36,900 --> 00:04:04,990
Sawada Kenji - Stripper

80
00:02:40,640 --> 00:02:43,740
Hmm not sure

81
00:02:44,660 --> 00:02:47,680
It's not always better to have fewer cards right?

82
00:02:47,740 --> 00:02:49,970
Now, it's gonna start now

83
00:02:49,970 --> 00:02:53,910
I gotta look carefully, I might mess up. Got one.

84
00:02:51,920 --> 00:02:53,920
Yes, please pay attention

85
00:02:56,760 --> 00:02:59,350
I'm kinda glad this one got eliminated

86
00:02:57,090 --> 00:03:01,720
Kayama Yuzo - Call over my wife

87
00:02:57,090 --> 00:03:01,730
Pair

88
00:03:00,280 --> 00:03:01,720
This is a pretty tricky song

89
00:03:02,500 --> 00:03:04,280
This one then please

90
00:03:04,280 --> 00:03:07,130
Eh? Do you have to sing for a long time? It's not just the one song?

91
00:03:07,260 --> 00:03:09,700
It's the one song I think,

92
00:03:09,750 --> 00:03:13,600
Maybe sing it twice?

93
00:03:11,780 --> 00:03:13,600
No no no...

94
00:03:13,600 --> 00:03:19,260
I have nothing. I have nothing. I have nothing

95
00:03:21,080 --> 00:03:23,370
This one...Ok ok

96
00:03:23,370 --> 00:03:25,210
Alrighty

97
00:03:25,210 --> 00:03:27,350
Please don't mess about when you sing

98
00:03:27,350 --> 00:03:30,750
This one is not good...

99
00:03:31,500 --> 00:03:35,320
It's quite hard to get a match isn't it

100
00:03:36,020 --> 00:03:38,390
This sucks

101
00:03:43,260 --> 00:03:46,200
Damn, it came back

102
00:03:48,020 --> 00:03:51,100
This one, c'mon

103
00:03:53,250 --> 00:03:55,140
Nice to meet you new card...

104
00:03:55,140 --> 00:03:58,610
You suck at this!!

105
00:03:58,610 --> 00:04:00,980
Just let Tanaka be out!

106
00:04:02,870 --> 00:04:04,990
No no no, that's not true

107
00:04:05,800 --> 00:04:10,000
Tanaka didn't get a single pair yet

108
00:04:10,610 --> 00:04:13,420
Tanaka get a pair

109
00:04:12,900 --> 00:04:15,080
Yes, I got one

110
00:04:15,970 --> 00:04:18,300
Tanaka after pairing

111
00:04:16,300 --> 00:04:21,410
Pair

112
00:04:16,320 --> 00:04:21,400
The Blue Hearts - Linda Linda

113
00:04:18,740 --> 00:04:21,400
It takes a hell of a lot of energy

114
00:04:19,260 --> 00:04:21,400
Yes yes yes yes yes yes

115
00:04:21,780 --> 00:04:23,600
Alright I've got one

116
00:04:22,140 --> 00:04:26,880
And he gets another pair in his next turn

117
00:04:24,440 --> 00:04:26,880
Pair

118
00:04:24,460 --> 00:04:26,880
Ueda Masaki - What a sad color

119
00:04:25,410 --> 00:04:26,880
Ah this one

120
00:04:27,720 --> 00:04:29,580
As well...

121
00:04:32,400 --> 00:04:33,860
Got it

122
00:04:33,800 --> 00:04:39,060
He gets 3 pairs in a row, and is in the lead right away!

123
00:04:34,020 --> 00:04:39,060
Pair

124
00:04:34,040 --> 00:04:39,060
Watanabe Misato - My Revolution

125
00:04:41,340 --> 00:04:43,590

126
00:04:41,340 --> 00:04:43,590
has won!

127
00:04:43,860 --> 00:05:16,490
Joker

128
00:04:44,060 --> 00:04:48,130
Yes! Thank you very much!

129
00:04:46,300 --> 00:04:48,130

00:04:48,320 --> 00:04:49,720
Ahh I have one!

132
00:04:49,720 --> 00:04:55,530
Following Tanaka, the other members also proceed at a great pace

133
00:04:50,690 --> 00:04:55,530
The Game Proceeds Quickly!

134
00:04:55,960 --> 00:05:00,770
The next one to get out?

135
00:04:56,940 --> 00:05:00,770
And, the one who won after Tanaka...

136
00:05:03,820 --> 00:05:06,750
Pair

has won!

142
00:05:07,460 --> 00:05:09,580
Which means...

143
00:05:07,460 --> 00:05:10,890
Please let me pair up with this card Hamada-san gave me!

144
00:05:09,580 --> 00:05:12,180
Please! Please!

145
00:05:12,510 --> 00:05:14,250
It came back!!

146
00:05:13,220 --> 00:05:14,250
Came back

147
00:05:15,500 --> 00:05:16,800
Just 3, now Hamada-san is gone

148
00:05:16,600 --> 00:05:18,540
If you get this one

149
00:05:16,830 --> 00:05:22,070
Current cards

150
00:05:17,940 --> 00:05:23,280
C'mon, I keep getting the same cards

151
00:05:21,200 --> 00:05:25,070
I hate this, I really hate this

152
00:05:22,070 --> 00:05:55,300

Joker

154
00:05:23,280 --> 00:05:25,070
Endo's continued whining

155
00:05:25,070 --> 00:05:27,140
Seriously hate this!!

156
00:05:27,140 --> 00:05:29,070
And it's rather a long song too

157
00:05:27,880 --> 00:05:29,070
Yes

158
00:05:29,370 --> 00:05:31,410
Please. Oh please.

159
00:05:29,370 --> 00:05:33,300
Please please please please

160
00:05:33,300 --> 00:05:34,040
Hui!

161
00:05:34,050 --> 00:05:35,240
AAAAAAAHHHHHHHHH!!!!!!

162
00:05:36,060 --> 00:05:37,820
Wrong!

163
00:05:40,300 --> 00:05:41,920
This one,

164
00:05:41,920 --> 00:05:45,990
It's alright if I get this one right? And take Endo's

165
00:05:44,120 --> 00:05:47,430
Yes that's correct

166
00:05:46,540 --> 00:05:49,180
C'mon please! I was almost there!

167
00:05:49,900 --> 00:05:51,100
C'mon!

168
00:05:53,130 --> 00:05:55,300
TUBE - Season in the sun

169
00:05:54,100 --> 00:05:55,300
SERIOUSLY?!

170
00:05:55,730 --> 00:05:58,070
Matsumoto

171
00:05:55,730 --> 00:05:58,070
has won!

172
00:05:58,120 --> 00:06:01,610
I could win here too right?

173
00:05:58,400 --> 00:06:01,610
Cards remaining

174
00:05:58,470 --> 00:06:01,610
Yeah if you get this one

175
00:06:00,000 --> 00:06:01,610
Yeah, you could

176
00:06:01,610 --> 00:06:02,810
Here I go!

177
00:06:01,610 --> 00:06:10,280
Joker

178
00:06:02,270 --> 00:06:04,270
I hate this!

179
00:06:04,510 --> 00:06:06,180
Please!

180
00:06:06,180 --> 00:06:10,280
C'mon-AHHHHHH!!!!!

181
00:06:10,780 --> 00:06:17,320
Now it's become a 1v1 battle between Hosei and Endo

182
00:06:11,440 --> 00:06:13,990
Yeah, you could win this

183
00:06:13,990 --> 00:06:17,320
Cause Yama-chan could make another unlucky draw

184
00:06:15,560 --> 00:06:17,320
Yes, Yes

185
00:06:17,320 --> 00:07:39,870
Joker

186
00:06:21,060 --> 00:06:22,530
Match point

187
00:06:22,530 --> 00:06:24,580
It depends now if it'll come back to him

188
00:06:24,560 --> 00:06:25,800
For real,

189
00:06:25,800 --> 00:06:28,170
Don't laugh or anything

190
00:06:28,170 --> 00:06:30,760
Take it seriously, or you have to start again

191
00:06:35,700 --> 00:06:36,510
What the hell?

192
00:06:36,510 --> 00:06:40,110
Are you two Don Frye and Takayama?

193
00:06:50,480 --> 00:06:53,690
AAAAAHHHHHHH!!!!!!!

194
00:06:55,660 --> 00:06:56,920
Oh dear!

195
00:06:57,560 --> 00:06:59,420
What the hell?

196
00:06:57,800 --> 00:07:00,800
YES! YES YES YES!

197
00:07:00,800 --> 00:07:03,000
I'm still in this

198
00:07:03,570 --> 00:07:06,570
It was a 50% chance too

199
00:07:05,200 --> 00:07:08,300
Amazing though.

200
00:07:08,300 --> 00:07:09,470
Oh please!

201
00:07:09,840 --> 00:07:13,180
Can we look at it?

202
00:07:11,580 --> 00:07:14,220
Yes, we should be able to

203
00:07:12,340 --> 00:07:14,220
It should be fine for us

204
00:07:15,850 --> 00:07:17,450
That one...

205
00:07:18,850 --> 00:07:21,250
This one would suck to do

206
00:07:25,400 --> 00:07:27,340
Alright

207
00:07:25,880 --> 00:07:28,290
This one sucks

208
00:07:28,290 --> 00:07:30,260
C'mon decide

209
00:07:32,440 --> 00:07:34,340
NOOOOOO!!!

210
00:07:34,420 --> 00:07:35,730
For real?

211
00:07:37,800 --> 00:07:39,870
This is amazing

212
00:07:38,740 --> 00:07:41,660
Will I be able to sing this? My voice is gone.

213
00:07:40,870 --> 00:07:45,940
Just how will this battle turn out?!

214
00:07:43,040 --> 00:07:43,270
Yes

215
00:07:43,380 --> 00:07:45,940
Yeah good job, this banter is funny

216
00:07:45,940 --> 00:08:10,870
Joker

217
00:07:47,810 --> 00:07:52,550
I won't look, and just use my hands to sense it

218
00:07:50,420 --> 00:07:52,550
What do you mean?

219
00:07:52,550 --> 00:07:55,240
That's what you've been doing this whole time

220
00:08:02,400 --> 00:08:04,100
Alright

221
00:08:08,130 --> 00:08:10,870
Matsuzaki Shigeru

222
00:08:08,130 --> 00:08:10,870
Pair

223
00:08:08,200 --> 00:08:10,870
Hosei

224
00:08:08,200 --> 00:08:10,870
has won!

225
00:08:11,400 --> 00:08:12,770
It's been decided

226
00:08:12,770 --> 00:08:17,780
The Jiji was Sawada Kenji-san's Stripper

227
00:08:14,960 --> 00:08:17,780
How did this one go again?

228
00:08:16,940 --> 00:08:19,840
It's Stripper

229
00:08:21,080 --> 00:09:36,790
A capella soulful rendition of Stripper

230
00:08:21,080 --> 00:09:36,790
Singer

231
00:08:44,600 --> 00:08:46,020
No no, he's gone back to the start

232
00:09:19,900 --> 00:09:21,540
That was unneccessary

233
00:09:38,720 --> 00:09:41,560
He was messing around in the start

234
00:09:40,360 --> 00:09:42,990
Yeah, the start you were too playful

235
00:09:42,990 --> 00:09:46,360
Like an imitation, you shouldn't do that

236
00:09:44,420 --> 00:09:46,360
I did think it was an impression

237
00:09:46,360 --> 00:09:51,500
No no, that was from my heart, a proper rendition

238
00:09:49,220 --> 00:09:51,500
Right from the start?

239
00:09:51,500 --> 00:09:53,740
Was that song always that long

240
00:09:53,740 --> 00:09:59,040
Even Julie wouldn't have sung like that for The Best 10

241
00:09:59,380 --> 00:10:01,760
Next, the 2nd round

242
00:09:59,380 --> 00:10:05,050
2nd Round: Creative Nursery Rhyme

243
00:10:01,760 --> 00:10:05,050
The theme, a creative nursery rhyme

244
00:10:05,050 --> 00:10:07,250
Ah, that's what it is huh...

245
00:10:07,690 --> 00:10:16,060
The cards have the title of a nursery rhyme. If you lose, please come up with a nursery rhyme based on the title.

246
00:10:16,700 --> 00:10:21,200
And the joker this time; "The Oinari General"

247
00:10:16,700 --> 00:10:21,200
TN: Inari is sushi rice stuffed inside fried tofu

248
00:10:21,200 --> 00:10:23,000
This is fine right?

249
00:10:22,100 --> 00:10:23,240
Ah, I have one

250
00:10:23,940 --> 00:10:26,070
The Napping Hermit

251
00:10:25,100 --> 00:10:29,080
The Napping Hermit, got rid of that

252
00:10:26,400 --> 00:10:29,110
Pair

253
00:10:26,400 --> 00:10:29,110
The Napping Hermit

254
00:10:29,160 --> 00:10:30,910
Here I go

255
00:10:29,410 --> 00:10:33,110
Jiji Nuki - Start

256
00:10:29,710 --> 00:10:31,730
I don't have anything

257
00:10:33,110 --> 00:11:37,740
Joker

258
00:10:33,220 --> 00:10:35,980
Somehow, yes!

259
00:10:36,160 --> 00:10:38,310
I got the Lying Tanuki

260
00:10:36,310 --> 00:10:39,220
Lying Tanuki

261
00:10:36,310 --> 00:10:39,220
Pair

262
00:10:41,990 --> 00:10:43,990
Well, there are a lot of cards

263
00:10:45,790 --> 00:10:47,960
Can you not see?

264
00:10:48,200 --> 00:10:50,800
This one?

265
00:10:50,800 --> 00:10:53,100
Tanaka is doing pretty good...

266
00:10:52,130 --> 00:10:53,100
That's true

267
00:10:53,100 --> 00:10:55,230
Wow

268
00:10:53,770 --> 00:10:55,770
Ah, I have one

269
00:10:55,570 --> 00:10:59,140
Pair

270
00:10:55,570 --> 00:10:59,140
The Chorus of the Toys

271
00:10:56,340 --> 00:10:59,140
"The Chorus of the Toys"

272
00:10:59,880 --> 00:11:06,040
Well, there's no point wasting time here

273
00:11:02,560 --> 00:11:06,040
Yeah, just draw the card and look at it

274
00:11:06,040 --> 00:11:09,360
Just have to hope you get a pair

275
00:11:09,360 --> 00:11:11,320
Alright, this one?

276
00:11:11,320 --> 00:11:14,550
First time seeing this!

277
00:11:14,550 --> 00:11:16,950
Yeah...What should I do?

278
00:11:17,620 --> 00:11:20,800
If I get a pair that would be amazing

279
00:11:19,880 --> 00:11:21,780
Yeah

280
00:11:20,800 --> 00:11:23,330
Well, I guess not

281
00:11:21,630 --> 00:11:23,330
The Old Man of the North Wind

282
00:11:23,830 --> 00:11:25,900
We already saw him sing Stripper

283
00:11:27,080 --> 00:11:29,570
Endo, who lost last round...

284
00:11:30,520 --> 00:11:32,060
I got one, I got it I got it

285
00:11:32,660 --> 00:11:35,270
After getting a pair...

286
00:11:35,270 --> 00:11:37,740
He remains on a streak!

287
00:11:35,610 --> 00:11:37,740
Pair

288
00:11:35,610 --> 00:11:37,740
The Old Man of the North Wind

289
00:11:39,020 --> 00:11:42,110
I got it, alright

290
00:11:42,450 --> 00:11:44,880
Pair

291
00:11:42,450 --> 00:11:44,880
The Kappa's Pajamas

292
00:11:45,780 --> 00:11:50,220
Endo is on fire and gets 3 pairs in a row!

293
00:11:47,290 --> 00:11:50,220
Guppy Sui Sui

294
00:11:47,290 --> 00:11:50,220
Pair

295
00:11:50,220 --> 00:11:53,220
Last one!

296
00:11:50,220 --> 00:12:00,900
Joker

297
00:11:53,220 --> 00:11:54,900
Are you done?

298
00:11:53,220 --> 00:11:55,930
Wow

299
00:11:53,960 --> 00:11:55,930
Yes, I'm done!

300
00:11:55,930 --> 00:12:00,900
Tanaka background

301
00:11:55,960 --> 00:11:57,530
YES!

302
00:11:57,530 --> 00:12:00,900
Endo

303
00:11:57,530 --> 00:12:00,900
has won!

304
00:12:01,660 --> 00:12:05,360
And the next one to win after Endo?

305
00:12:01,670 --> 00:12:12,910
Joker

306
00:12:05,440 --> 00:12:06,340
Alright!

307
00:12:06,670 --> 00:12:12,910
Pair

308
00:12:06,670 --> 00:12:12,910
The Ant's Inner Monologue

309
00:12:07,000 --> 00:12:09,270
There it is!

310
00:12:08,500 --> 00:12:12,910
"The Ant's Inner Monologue"

311
00:12:09,270 --> 00:12:12,910
He's so good!

312
00:12:09,670 --> 00:12:12,910
Hamada

313
00:12:09,670 --> 00:12:12,910
has won!

314
00:12:12,960 --> 00:12:15,710
Seriously?

315
00:12:13,240 --> 00:12:18,650
Cards remaining

316
00:12:14,340 --> 00:12:15,710
I would hate this too

317
00:12:16,280 --> 00:12:18,650
Yama-chan, take his card

318
00:12:17,260 --> 00:12:18,650
I did it!

319
00:12:18,650 --> 00:12:19,950
Well that's it,

320
00:12:18,650 --> 00:14:09,130
Joker

321
00:12:19,950 --> 00:12:20,990
He has to take his card

322
00:12:20,990 --> 00:12:23,760
All that matters is if this is a pair

323
00:12:21,820 --> 00:12:23,790
Yeah, theres' no helping it

324
00:12:22,260 --> 00:12:24,300
It's a matter of chance now

325
00:12:23,760 --> 00:12:26,920
If I get a pair, I'm done right?

326
00:12:24,380 --> 00:12:26,920
Yes! Exactly

327
00:12:26,920 --> 00:12:29,390
The probability is pretty good here

328
00:12:27,740 --> 00:12:29,390
Yes, it is

329
00:12:31,860 --> 00:12:33,730
No, no, hold on

330
00:12:34,320 --> 00:12:36,330
No, no, no hold on

331
00:12:36,330 --> 00:12:40,670
Yes, I'm done now

332
00:12:36,600 --> 00:12:38,070
Alright

333
00:12:38,070 --> 00:12:40,670
Tanaka

334
00:12:38,070 --> 00:12:40,670
has won!

335
00:12:40,970 --> 00:12:43,000
So if I get a pair, I win

336
00:12:41,010 --> 00:12:44,280
Cards remaining

337
00:12:42,300 --> 00:12:44,280
Yes

338
00:12:43,000 --> 00:12:44,280
IF you get a pair

339
00:12:44,280 --> 00:12:47,040
Please!

340
00:12:50,380 --> 00:12:52,440
He didn't get a pair!

341
00:12:51,580 --> 00:12:53,950
I thought I was screwed!

342
00:12:52,800 --> 00:12:54,440
Chance! You've got a chance!

343
00:12:55,090 --> 00:12:57,860
I thought you got a pair!!

344
00:12:59,000 --> 00:13:01,190
Can you stop yelling like "BIYAA" please

345
00:13:01,560 --> 00:13:03,930
You needed to get a pair then!

346
00:13:04,530 --> 00:13:06,230
This just got dangerous

347
00:13:06,230 --> 00:13:10,670
Cause 2 out of the 3 cards will make a pair

348
00:13:08,540 --> 00:13:10,670
Yes

349
00:13:11,340 --> 00:13:13,070
If I get this, then I'm done

350
00:13:12,000 --> 00:13:13,070
You're done

351
00:13:13,140 --> 00:13:15,710
ALRIGHHHTTTT!!!!!

352
00:13:16,080 --> 00:13:17,710
You can do this

353
00:13:16,710 --> 00:13:19,480
Please, please for real

354
00:13:17,710 --> 00:13:19,480
This is it

355
00:13:19,480 --> 00:13:23,110
I have almost a 70% chance of winning

356
00:13:20,410 --> 00:13:23,110
Yes yes yes

357
00:13:23,110 --> 00:13:25,950
It depends on your luck

358
00:13:24,740 --> 00:13:28,480
Please, please get the joker!

359
00:13:30,790 --> 00:13:37,130
When you're not sure ...

360
00:13:34,660 --> 00:13:37,130
TAKE THE MIDDLE!!

361
00:13:38,860 --> 00:13:41,170
NOPE!!

362
00:13:41,170 --> 00:13:42,620
YES! YES! YES! YES!

363
00:13:44,620 --> 00:13:45,960
YES!

364
00:13:45,960 --> 00:13:48,280
This is unpredictable!

365
00:13:48,280 --> 00:13:51,280
We don't know how this will turn out

366
00:13:50,220 --> 00:13:53,080
That's some luck you have there!

367
00:13:58,280 --> 00:14:01,720
It was like that before too, just like now

368
00:14:02,940 --> 00:14:04,320
Yama-chan,

369
00:14:04,320 --> 00:14:09,130
You have to make him take the punishment at least once

370
00:14:05,900 --> 00:14:09,130
(Everyone) Yes that's true

371
00:14:10,130 --> 00:14:14,930
MATSUMOTO IN TROUBLE!!

372
00:14:10,860 --> 00:14:12,300
It's almost a 70% chance

373
00:14:12,300 --> 00:14:14,930
He's never gotten the punishment before

374
00:14:14,930 --> 00:14:46,960
Joker

375
00:14:15,430 --> 00:14:16,170
I'm calm

376
00:14:16,170 --> 00:14:17,500
I don't care

377
00:14:17,680 --> 00:14:18,980
I don't care

378
00:14:20,160 --> 00:14:22,340
I am free of greed

379
00:14:22,340 --> 00:14:24,110
Either card is fine with me

380
00:14:22,440 --> 00:14:24,240
C'mon, c'mon

381
00:14:24,210 --> 00:14:26,640
It's fine if I lose ... It's fine if I lose

382
00:14:27,960 --> 00:14:31,050
He's being very gentle

383
00:14:29,160 --> 00:14:31,050
Yes, yes you're alright

384
00:14:31,050 --> 00:14:35,020
Please! Please! Please!

385
00:14:32,560 --> 00:14:35,020
Just keep being gentle

386
00:14:35,540 --> 00:14:37,460
This sucks

387
00:14:37,960 --> 00:14:40,460
He's going to check like that again

388
00:14:42,740 --> 00:14:45,780
YEEEEESSSSS!!!!

389
00:14:43,590 --> 00:14:46,960

00:14:43,590 --> 00:14:46,960

393
00:14:46,180 --> 00:14:48,800
What?! Which one is it

394
00:14:48,800 --> 00:14:51,880
It's either one, either nursery rhyme

395
00:14:49,670 --> 00:14:50,940
WHICH ONE?!

396
00:14:51,870 --> 00:14:53,970
I hate this!

397
00:14:53,970 --> 00:14:56,170
Sing one of those 2

398
00:14:54,180 --> 00:14:56,170
It's between those 2

399
00:14:56,170 --> 00:14:58,840
You have to start immediately

400
00:14:57,000 --> 00:14:57,980
Here it comes!

401
00:14:57,980 --> 00:14:58,840
Here it is

402
00:14:59,840 --> 00:15:01,300
This one!

403
00:15:00,500 --> 00:15:02,260
Ok!!

404
00:15:02,260 --> 00:15:03,950
Please!

405
00:15:04,980 --> 00:15:21,170
Matsumoto's Improvised Nursery Ryme

406
00:15:05,920 --> 00:15:09,520
I thought it was scary so I headed there,

407
00:15:09,590 --> 00:15:13,120
The General came over from the other side

408
00:15:13,260 --> 00:15:16,860
I thought it was scary so I headed there,

409
00:15:17,300 --> 00:15:20,630
*Paku Paku* - It was so tasty!

410
00:15:20,630 --> 00:15:23,440
That was the fucking worst huh?

411
00:15:25,140 --> 00:15:26,970
That was the worst

412
00:15:27,370 --> 00:15:32,210
I didn't even mention the word Oinari

413
00:15:32,210 --> 00:15:33,880
You didn't say Oinari once!

414
00:15:34,880 --> 00:15:39,420
That was not it, that was not it!

415
00:15:37,320 --> 00:15:39,420
That was not it!

416
00:15:40,690 --> 00:15:43,720
My brain is gonna melt

417
00:15:47,260 --> 00:15:50,760
You were moving your back so much! Like this

418
00:15:50,760 --> 00:15:54,470
Your back, just bending and bending

419
00:15:54,640 --> 00:15:56,470
It's so hot

420
00:15:56,900 --> 00:15:58,570
Moving his whole body

421
00:15:59,040 --> 00:16:01,300
The final round, the Batsu game!

422
00:15:59,170 --> 00:16:06,440
Third round: Batsu game

423
00:16:01,800 --> 00:16:06,440
This time, please enjoy while trying to guess the Joker card

424
00:16:06,810 --> 00:16:09,550
Jiji Nuki - Start

425
00:16:06,810 --> 00:16:09,550
Right away the game starts!

426
00:16:09,550 --> 00:16:57,760
Joker

427
00:16:10,600 --> 00:16:13,220
They definitely can't do this one

428
00:16:13,220 --> 00:16:15,140
I think this is a good one to get rid of

429
00:16:15,360 --> 00:16:16,720
"Ceiling Suspension"?

430
00:16:16,720 --> 00:16:19,220
Why would they do this?

431
00:16:16,990 --> 00:16:19,220
Ceiling Suspension Consolidation

432
00:16:16,990 --> 00:16:19,220
Pair

433
00:16:17,380 --> 00:16:19,220
It's too much

434
00:16:20,090 --> 00:16:22,260
Allow me to choose...

435
00:16:21,130 --> 00:16:22,260
EH!?

436
00:16:22,260 --> 00:16:24,500
I just went

437
00:16:24,900 --> 00:16:26,800
If you even touched it slightly,

438
00:16:26,800 --> 00:16:30,740
If you even touched it slightly, you're out

439
00:16:27,570 --> 00:16:30,740
But I didn't, I didn't touch it

440
00:16:30,740 --> 00:16:31,220
Ok

441
00:16:31,220 --> 00:16:33,800
He said "Allow me to choose"

442
00:16:38,360 --> 00:16:39,580
Nothing...

443
00:16:39,580 --> 00:16:42,280
This interesting looking one

444
00:16:43,380 --> 00:16:45,320
You have 5 now

445
00:16:45,380 --> 00:16:48,190
Not that many

446
00:16:49,560 --> 00:16:51,220
Ahh, where did it go. There it is

447
00:16:51,220 --> 00:16:53,080
You have one?

448
00:16:55,060 --> 00:16:57,760
Face Balloon Box

449
00:16:55,060 --> 00:16:57,760
Pair

450
00:16:55,820 --> 00:16:57,760
That was a risky one

451
00:16:58,000 --> 00:17:02,700
The game seemed to be progressing smoothly...

452
00:17:02,700 --> 00:17:05,540
Shin Ruler

453
00:17:03,080 --> 00:17:05,540
First time seeing this, this one is scary too

454
00:17:05,540 --> 00:17:37,500
Joker

455
00:17:05,740 --> 00:17:07,540
This one

456
00:17:08,340 --> 00:17:09,870
That's not it..

457
00:17:11,720 --> 00:17:13,280
Hmm?

458
00:17:13,860 --> 00:17:16,250
Pairs become rare

459
00:17:16,350 --> 00:17:18,250
Surely by now we'll get one

460
00:17:17,520 --> 00:17:20,890
From those cards?

461
00:17:18,250 --> 00:17:20,890
From those cards. Hmm?

462
00:17:21,150 --> 00:17:23,320
This is messed up

463
00:17:22,220 --> 00:17:25,760
A right jab to the face

464
00:17:22,680 --> 00:17:25,760
That does sound messed

465
00:17:24,980 --> 00:17:25,760
Messed up?

466
00:17:29,190 --> 00:17:32,200
They can't do this one!!

467
00:17:30,600 --> 00:17:32,200
Yeah that one...

468
00:17:32,320 --> 00:17:35,040
AHHH! Please let this work out!

469
00:17:35,980 --> 00:17:37,500
Again...

470
00:17:37,500 --> 00:17:40,910
A right jab to the face

471
00:17:38,340 --> 00:17:40,910
What the hell? There are cards like this?

472
00:17:40,910 --> 00:18:10,270
Joker

473
00:17:41,770 --> 00:17:45,040
This is messed up!!

474
00:17:49,910 --> 00:17:51,850
I'm not getting any at all...

475
00:17:52,600 --> 00:17:55,080
I have like 6 of them

476
00:17:55,960 --> 00:17:59,260
Endo you should get one by now

477
00:17:59,260 --> 00:18:04,430
If we can't end this in the next minute Endo is the loser

478
00:18:01,560 --> 00:18:04,430
No no no no no

479
00:18:04,430 --> 00:18:06,660
We definitely won't end in the next minute

480
00:18:06,900 --> 00:18:10,270
You don't have a pair huh? Even with that many cards

481
00:18:08,180 --> 00:18:10,270
I don't

482
00:18:10,570 --> 00:18:14,410
No matches at all...

483
00:18:11,300 --> 00:18:14,220
The game continued like that,

484
00:18:15,270 --> 00:18:18,510
8 minutes passed by

485
00:18:15,440 --> 00:18:18,510
For 8 minutes

486
00:18:18,510 --> 00:18:21,550
I think this area will work out

487
00:18:21,140 --> 00:18:23,880
You said that last time too...

488
00:18:23,880 --> 00:18:27,220

Why are there so many nipple ones?!

492
00:18:28,200 --> 00:18:31,760
There's so many nipple ones

493
00:18:29,060 --> 00:18:31,760
They're definitley suggesting soemthing

494
00:18:30,580 --> 00:18:31,760
Yes exactly

495
00:18:31,760 --> 00:18:33,060
Trying to make us mess up,

496
00:18:33,060 --> 00:18:36,260
Trying to make us mess up, you can see the staff's evilness

497
00:18:36,400 --> 00:18:39,260
You guys can't do that

498
00:18:39,820 --> 00:18:41,880
Let's go with this one

499
00:18:43,730 --> 00:18:45,540
Nope. Here you go

500
00:18:48,200 --> 00:18:51,100

501
00:18:52,510 --> 00:19:12,700
Joker

502
00:18:53,680 --> 00:18:55,280
Nothing?

503
00:18:55,280 --> 00:18:57,620
Are you playing Mahjong?

504
00:18:57,620 --> 00:19:00,120
I thought I had one!

505
00:19:00,120 --> 00:19:02,790
I just thought I had one

506
00:19:01,640 --> 00:19:02,790
You made us nervous

507
00:19:04,260 --> 00:19:05,600
Do I have one?

508
00:19:05,060 --> 00:19:06,660

Nipple and nipple ...

514
00:19:12,900 --> 00:19:17,300
Joker

515
00:19:16,500 --> 00:19:18,470
This is a pair right?

516
00:19:20,600 --> 00:20:06,680
Joker

517
00:19:21,010 --> 00:19:23,770
He's playing Mahjong

518
00:19:23,770 --> 00:19:26,640
Hmm? Hold on...

519
00:19:24,160 --> 00:19:26,640
He's trying to trick us again

520
00:19:27,140 --> 00:19:30,100

521
00:19:28,720 --> 00:19:30,800

It's nipple & nipple again!

527
00:19:42,230 --> 00:19:44,130
Nipple Sucking Old Man

528
00:19:44,130 --> 00:19:47,230
And it's the wrong nipple one that I pick

529
00:19:47,230 --> 00:19:51,540
Tanaka's got all of them, they aren't circulating past him

530
00:19:51,870 --> 00:19:54,310
It's become stagnant

531
00:19:53,300 --> 00:19:56,510
I keep seeing the same nipple ones

532
00:20:05,520 --> 00:20:09,290

537
00:20:12,160 --> 00:20:14,690
The same cards

538
00:20:12,600 --> 00:20:14,690
This might be a record

539
00:20:14,800 --> 00:20:16,690
That's true

540
00:20:16,790 --> 00:20:19,530

00:20:19,760 --> 00:20:21,930

Everything I took from Yamasaki,

545
00:20:25,140 --> 00:20:27,270
You have all of them right?

546
00:20:27,720 --> 00:20:28,570
Oh really?

547
00:20:28,570 --> 00:20:31,980
So like the same goddamn cards keep coming back

548
00:20:32,180 --> 00:20:42,290
Joker

549
00:20:32,620 --> 00:20:36,060
15 minutes since the start

550
00:20:35,260 --> 00:20:37,580
Surely now

551
00:20:37,580 --> 00:20:39,050
Yes, I got one

552
00:20:39,140 --> 00:20:42,290

553
00:20:39,380 --> 00:20:42,290

I've never seen that before!

556
00:20:42,480 --> 00:20:45,560

564
00:20:59,360 --> 00:21:02,170
Which means I'm done yes

OKAY!

569
00:21:04,170 --> 00:21:06,640

571
00:21:07,440 --> 00:21:09,520
