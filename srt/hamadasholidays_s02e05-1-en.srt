1
00:00:01,930 --> 00:00:05,230
Day one in Pattaya, Thailand.

2
00:00:06,030 --> 00:00:08,820
When we have a meal together,

3
00:00:08,900 --> 00:00:12,600
I thought it should be authentic Thai.

4
00:00:13,100 --> 00:00:16,630
I brought something so it doesn't feel like Japan.

5
00:00:17,000 --> 00:00:18,100
Look.

6
00:00:19,360 --> 00:00:20,380
What...?

7
00:00:20,460 --> 00:00:22,730
-Look.
-What is it?

8
00:00:23,000 --> 00:00:24,130
Coriander.

9
00:00:25,230 --> 00:00:27,420
Thai food's all about coriander.

10
00:00:27,500 --> 00:00:30,200
So we should all have coriander.

11
00:00:30,300 --> 00:00:31,900
Why Mr Potato Head?

12
00:00:31,980 --> 00:00:34,780
I borrowed it from my son as a container.

13
00:00:34,860 --> 00:00:36,280
-Seriously?
-Cute.

14
00:00:36,360 --> 00:00:40,480
See? Just by smelling it,
you feel like it's Thailand.

15
00:00:40,560 --> 00:00:42,980
You have a point, I suppose.

16
00:00:43,060 --> 00:00:47,980
And whatever you're doing or eating,
coriander makes it more Thai.

17
00:00:48,060 --> 00:00:50,000
-So I brought it.
-I see.

18
00:00:50,760 --> 00:00:54,560
They only used this once in their whole journey.

19
00:00:55,600 --> 00:00:56,920
Put some coriander.

20
00:00:57,000 --> 00:00:58,620
Oh yeah.

21
00:00:58,700 --> 00:01:01,060
-Nice idea.
-Why not?

22
00:01:02,960 --> 00:01:04,260
That's wrong.

23
00:01:05,600 --> 00:01:08,330
That's not how you give it to him.

24
00:01:09,130 --> 00:01:10,250
Put some more.

25
00:01:10,330 --> 00:01:12,450
Give him some more. Go on.

26
00:01:12,530 --> 00:01:14,380
-That was enough.
-Go on.

27
00:01:14,460 --> 00:01:15,500
No...

28
00:01:17,500 --> 00:01:18,900
So forceful.

29
00:01:20,200 --> 00:01:22,500
How is it?

30
00:01:22,600 --> 00:01:24,600
Doesn't go well with takoyaki.

31
00:01:25,500 --> 00:01:26,500
So bad.

32
00:01:27,830 --> 00:01:31,160
Hamada's Holiday in Thailand.

33
00:01:33,900 --> 00:01:39,300
The six researched Pattaya thoroughly
and gave a presentation to Hamada.

34
00:01:40,400 --> 00:01:44,200
Hamada and company
stayed at Mera Mare Pattaya,

35
00:01:44,360 --> 00:01:47,730
a four-star hotel that opened in 2016.

36
00:01:49,000 --> 00:01:51,760
Located in central Pattaya by Beach Road,

37
00:01:51,960 --> 00:01:54,800
it's ideal for business, leisure, and golf.

38
00:01:56,060 --> 00:01:58,650
In addition to 80 fully-equipped rooms,

39
00:01:58,730 --> 00:02:01,200
it also has gorgeous suites.

40
00:02:02,360 --> 00:02:05,530
This hotel will be the base during this trip.

41
00:02:08,260 --> 00:02:14,560
Whose presentation
did Hamada choose as third place?

42
00:02:16,700 --> 00:02:19,220
Please announce third place.

43
00:02:19,300 --> 00:02:20,250
Third place.

44
00:02:20,330 --> 00:02:22,950
The prize is 1,000 bahts.

45
00:02:23,030 --> 00:02:24,130
That's big.

46
00:02:24,300 --> 00:02:26,330
In third place is...

47
00:02:32,860 --> 00:02:34,400
-Taiki!
-Thank you!

48
00:02:34,550 --> 00:02:37,050
It's definitely good enough.

49
00:02:37,200 --> 00:02:39,420
-Well done.
-Thank you.

50
00:02:39,500 --> 00:02:41,600
It was very Thai.

51
00:02:41,760 --> 00:02:44,630
-Yes.
-I didn't want to go at first.

52
00:02:45,060 --> 00:02:47,950
-To be frank.
-To be frank, I didn't.

53
00:02:48,030 --> 00:02:50,000
I didn't want them near me.

54
00:02:51,060 --> 00:02:53,680
-We were outside a lot.
-Yeah.

55
00:02:53,760 --> 00:02:57,250
It was fun, riding on it.

56
00:02:57,330 --> 00:02:58,720
It lifted him up.

57
00:02:58,800 --> 00:03:02,350
-Beautifully.
-We could never do that in Japan.

58
00:03:02,430 --> 00:03:04,500
-Only in Thailand.
-True.

59
00:03:04,600 --> 00:03:06,260
It was a great picture.

60
00:03:07,260 --> 00:03:11,600
Taiki from "Dorians" wins third place
with this presentation.

61
00:03:12,400 --> 00:03:15,600
Morning, day two of the trip in Pattaya.

62
00:03:17,500 --> 00:03:18,550
Good morning!

63
00:03:18,730 --> 00:03:21,500
Good morning.

64
00:03:21,700 --> 00:03:23,700
-Uh-huh.
-So quiet.

65
00:03:24,700 --> 00:03:26,150
-Hey.
-Huh?

66
00:03:27,130 --> 00:03:28,160
What?

67
00:03:30,160 --> 00:03:31,400
We're filming.

68
00:03:31,830 --> 00:03:33,060
It's started.

69
00:03:33,360 --> 00:03:34,800
Yo!

70
00:03:35,500 --> 00:03:36,450
He's cheerful.

71
00:03:36,650 --> 00:03:37,800
He is.

72
00:03:37,900 --> 00:03:39,220
Good.

73
00:03:39,330 --> 00:03:41,860
-Get over it.
-Like Hitoshi Ueki.

74
00:03:44,630 --> 00:03:45,700
Leave it.

75
00:03:45,930 --> 00:03:50,080
We've not seen much of Thailand.
It's awesome. Let's go see it.

76
00:03:50,400 --> 00:03:52,300
Well yeah, but where?

77
00:03:52,400 --> 00:03:54,150
Taiki's on that duty.

78
00:03:54,250 --> 00:03:56,260
-Leave it to me.
-Thanks, Taiki.

79
00:03:56,900 --> 00:03:58,180
Where are we going?

80
00:03:58,260 --> 00:04:01,230
It's somewhere that's typically Thai.

81
00:04:01,830 --> 00:04:05,850
In my opinion. I have plans, but first...

82
00:04:06,150 --> 00:04:08,500
let's have a go at shooting.

83
00:04:08,690 --> 00:04:10,460
-Shall we go?
-Shooting, huh?

84
00:04:12,400 --> 00:04:15,280
We've all done it before.

85
00:04:15,560 --> 00:04:18,300
Did you bring your own equipment?

86
00:04:18,730 --> 00:04:20,500
-My own what?
-Guns.

87
00:04:21,300 --> 00:04:22,140
Your stuff.

88
00:04:22,500 --> 00:04:25,150
-I'm not allowed.
-You have them?

89
00:04:25,600 --> 00:04:27,150
Nice.

90
00:04:27,880 --> 00:04:29,120
We believed you.

91
00:04:29,200 --> 00:04:31,500
He doesn't have guns.

92
00:04:31,600 --> 00:04:32,600
I don't own any.

93
00:04:33,860 --> 00:04:34,900
Okay, shooting.

94
00:04:35,160 --> 00:04:39,680
Well I came up with a few ideas,
so please decide which one you want.

95
00:04:39,760 --> 00:04:46,000
There's The Million Years Stone Park
and Pattaya Crocodile Farm. A long name.

96
00:04:46,800 --> 00:04:51,060
What we can do is feed crocodiles there.

97
00:04:51,200 --> 00:04:54,160
You can't do that in Japan.

98
00:04:54,860 --> 00:04:57,950
So if you want to feed crocodiles, you go there.

99
00:04:58,080 --> 00:05:00,200
Exactly. Those who want to.

100
00:05:00,460 --> 00:05:01,800
I don't want to.

101
00:05:02,600 --> 00:05:04,500
What's the point in that?

102
00:05:05,130 --> 00:05:07,500
Why would I want to do that?

103
00:05:08,400 --> 00:05:09,350
Why not?

104
00:05:09,430 --> 00:05:11,730
It's exciting to approach them.

105
00:05:12,160 --> 00:05:13,350
They're big.

106
00:05:13,550 --> 00:05:18,630
There's even a show where a man
puts his head in a crocodile's mouth.

107
00:05:20,830 --> 00:05:22,260
I've seen it on TV.

108
00:05:25,060 --> 00:05:27,860
-You have?
-Yeah, a head goes in.

109
00:05:28,060 --> 00:05:31,460
-Like this.
-Yeah, and he just goes "Yay."

110
00:05:32,060 --> 00:05:35,200
They have other animals. Like tigers.

111
00:05:36,260 --> 00:05:38,560
We can go up to them.

112
00:05:39,130 --> 00:05:40,220
Go up to them?

113
00:05:40,300 --> 00:05:41,320
Right next to it.

114
00:05:41,400 --> 00:05:43,800
That's an odd way to explain it.

115
00:05:44,160 --> 00:05:45,700
We can lie next to it.

116
00:05:46,600 --> 00:05:50,900
You know, I looked up Pattaya on Instagram.

117
00:05:51,030 --> 00:05:54,050
-Loads of pics were with tigers.
-Really?

118
00:05:54,330 --> 00:05:56,180
So I know that it's popular.

119
00:05:56,260 --> 00:06:00,250
In Japan, in safari parks,
we're in a car or they're caged.

120
00:06:00,330 --> 00:06:04,460
But Thai people, they just sit next to the tigers.

121
00:06:05,200 --> 00:06:06,800
-Never.
-Never?

122
00:06:07,060 --> 00:06:10,580
I don't trust them. Something will happen.

123
00:06:10,660 --> 00:06:11,500
I see.

124
00:06:11,600 --> 00:06:14,160
-Seshita.
-I'll be there.

125
00:06:14,630 --> 00:06:16,360
I'll attack the tiger.

126
00:06:16,560 --> 00:06:18,160
No, no, no...

127
00:06:18,830 --> 00:06:23,760
Even you couldn't beat a tiger
if it attacks us, Seshita.

128
00:06:24,430 --> 00:06:27,060
Well, I'll be in the middle.

129
00:06:27,400 --> 00:06:29,420
Between him and the tiger?

130
00:06:29,500 --> 00:06:31,620
He's the tiger, I'm Hamada.

131
00:06:31,700 --> 00:06:35,460
And Hamada is petting the tiger, like this.

132
00:06:35,860 --> 00:06:38,600
For photos, I'll just do this.

133
00:06:39,500 --> 00:06:40,850
Considerate.

134
00:06:40,930 --> 00:06:42,330
I'll just vanish.

135
00:06:42,600 --> 00:06:44,060
What if it attacks?

136
00:06:44,700 --> 00:06:46,650
What are you doing?

137
00:06:47,600 --> 00:06:49,730
-Whoa, whoa.
-I'm not a tiger.

138
00:06:50,260 --> 00:06:53,900
Ouch. You're so strong. That really hurt.

139
00:06:54,800 --> 00:06:56,200
Are you the tiger?

140
00:06:56,560 --> 00:06:58,600
Who's the tiger? It's him.

141
00:06:58,730 --> 00:07:01,960
He's only lost against US soldiers in a fight.

142
00:07:02,160 --> 00:07:04,660
-He won against everyone else.
-Impressive.

143
00:07:05,460 --> 00:07:06,500
What else?

144
00:07:06,700 --> 00:07:08,200
I have other plans.

145
00:07:08,560 --> 00:07:11,600
Please listen to me. Of course I do.

146
00:07:11,700 --> 00:07:12,980
He went for the TV.

147
00:07:14,460 --> 00:07:15,600
Well, elephants.

148
00:07:16,800 --> 00:07:18,680
How does that sound?

149
00:07:18,760 --> 00:07:21,200
Surely that's a Thai experience.

150
00:07:21,560 --> 00:07:23,000
Let's ride an elephant.

151
00:07:23,300 --> 00:07:24,630
Ride on it for what?

152
00:07:25,130 --> 00:07:26,400
"For what?"

153
00:07:26,530 --> 00:07:28,730
You go, "I'm on an elephant!"

154
00:07:31,130 --> 00:07:32,260
You would, huh?

155
00:07:37,430 --> 00:07:38,700
But...

156
00:07:39,430 --> 00:07:40,660
That's it?

157
00:07:42,030 --> 00:07:43,760
It's about your emotions?

158
00:07:45,500 --> 00:07:47,300
It's just how you feel.

159
00:07:50,850 --> 00:07:53,000
We'll interact with them too.

160
00:07:53,100 --> 00:07:54,160
OK.

161
00:07:54,500 --> 00:07:55,750
Let's go.

162
00:07:55,850 --> 00:07:57,650
-Elephants.
-Let's go.

163
00:07:57,750 --> 00:08:00,680
Yes. I've already prepared for it.

164
00:08:00,960 --> 00:08:02,260
-Elephant it is.
-Okay.

165
00:08:02,500 --> 00:08:03,900
We're doing it.

166
00:08:04,760 --> 00:08:06,450
-I look forward to it.
-Good plan.

167
00:08:07,230 --> 00:08:09,030
We'll go to the elephants.

168
00:08:10,000 --> 00:08:14,530
They went to a famous elephant spot in Pattaya.

169
00:08:15,930 --> 00:08:18,800
In South Africa, I ate an elephant's trunk.

170
00:08:20,800 --> 00:08:21,930
Really?

171
00:08:22,360 --> 00:08:24,160
It was so hard.

172
00:08:24,380 --> 00:08:25,220
Hard?

173
00:08:25,300 --> 00:08:28,100
They sliced it up and served it to us.

174
00:08:28,340 --> 00:08:29,180
Was it long?

175
00:08:29,260 --> 00:08:31,820
-Yeah, grilled.
-Not rings?

176
00:08:31,900 --> 00:08:33,160
They slice it up.

177
00:08:34,600 --> 00:08:36,860
They steam it and grill it.

178
00:08:37,200 --> 00:08:38,600
You can slice it up.

179
00:08:39,100 --> 00:08:41,830
I asked Naito to eat it first.

180
00:08:42,100 --> 00:08:43,860
He had it and said,

181
00:08:44,120 --> 00:08:45,230
"That's hard!"

182
00:08:48,060 --> 00:08:50,080
An elephant's trunk is hard.

183
00:08:50,160 --> 00:08:51,120
It looks hard.

184
00:08:51,200 --> 00:08:53,130
It won't be tender.

185
00:08:53,960 --> 00:08:54,980
What's it like?

186
00:08:55,060 --> 00:08:56,700
Here we are.

187
00:08:57,430 --> 00:08:59,100
Pattaya Elephant Village.

188
00:08:59,250 --> 00:09:02,350
Okay, let's go inside.

189
00:09:03,030 --> 00:09:04,060
Let's go.

190
00:09:04,150 --> 00:09:05,850
-Elephant Village.
-Are they here?

191
00:09:05,950 --> 00:09:07,030
Yes.

192
00:09:07,160 --> 00:09:09,100
-I smell animals.
-Yeah.

193
00:09:09,330 --> 00:09:11,000
This is very realistic.

194
00:09:11,250 --> 00:09:14,580
-Look at that...
-This must be for something.

195
00:09:14,660 --> 00:09:15,680
Like a show.

196
00:09:15,760 --> 00:09:18,800
They have Thai dance shows here.

197
00:09:23,760 --> 00:09:24,900
There's one.

198
00:09:25,250 --> 00:09:27,500
See? They're just there.

199
00:09:28,530 --> 00:09:29,860
Amazing.

200
00:09:32,030 --> 00:09:33,660
-It's a child.
-Yes.

201
00:09:33,900 --> 00:09:35,300
It looks really happy.

202
00:09:35,450 --> 00:09:36,900
I'm scared.

203
00:09:37,960 --> 00:09:43,160
Pattaya Elephant Village opened in 1973.

204
00:09:43,300 --> 00:09:46,900
Elephants are important workers in Thai jungles.

205
00:09:47,330 --> 00:09:51,660
This place was opened to protect
the ones who became too old...

206
00:09:51,760 --> 00:09:54,430
...or injured and couldn't work any longer.

207
00:09:55,830 --> 00:10:00,030
Here, it is possible to interact with elephants.

208
00:10:02,500 --> 00:10:05,900
They have bananas that we can feed them.

209
00:10:06,660 --> 00:10:10,300
-Please feed the elephant yourselves.
-Feel free to do it.

210
00:10:12,200 --> 00:10:13,660
Look at the size of that snake.

211
00:10:13,930 --> 00:10:14,850
So huge.

212
00:10:14,940 --> 00:10:16,620
It's so surreal.

213
00:10:16,800 --> 00:10:18,300
Wow.

214
00:10:18,460 --> 00:10:20,260
It's overwhelming.

215
00:10:20,460 --> 00:10:22,230
Information overload.

216
00:10:23,300 --> 00:10:24,460
Come on, people.

217
00:10:25,400 --> 00:10:26,650
Feed it.

218
00:10:26,730 --> 00:10:29,030
-Shall we?
-Come on.

219
00:10:29,230 --> 00:10:30,680
It's waiting.

220
00:10:30,760 --> 00:10:31,830
How do I do it?

221
00:10:32,560 --> 00:10:34,450
-It's coming to me.
-Pass it to his trunk.

222
00:10:34,900 --> 00:10:36,800
-Whoa!
-Hurry up.

223
00:10:36,880 --> 00:10:37,720
Sorry.

224
00:10:37,800 --> 00:10:38,930
Get on with it.

225
00:10:39,130 --> 00:10:41,180
He wants it. Come on.

226
00:10:41,260 --> 00:10:42,200
Amazing.

227
00:10:43,560 --> 00:10:45,850
It uses the trunk really well.

228
00:10:47,000 --> 00:10:48,300
It grabs it.

229
00:10:51,550 --> 00:10:52,850
It's quite fun.

230
00:10:53,960 --> 00:10:55,220
And if I put it down?

231
00:10:55,300 --> 00:10:56,760
It'll pick it up.

232
00:10:59,200 --> 00:11:00,230
There.

233
00:11:04,300 --> 00:11:05,230
Amazing.

234
00:11:06,200 --> 00:11:07,860
-Amazing, huh?
-So hard.

235
00:11:08,060 --> 00:11:09,100
Excuse me.

236
00:11:09,800 --> 00:11:11,060
What are you doing?

237
00:11:11,300 --> 00:11:12,860
It's my breakfast.

238
00:11:13,060 --> 00:11:15,420
Your stomach can handle anything now.

239
00:11:15,500 --> 00:11:17,000
Thailand suits me.

240
00:11:18,750 --> 00:11:19,620
Sorry.

241
00:11:19,700 --> 00:11:22,100
-You stole the bananas.
-Right?

242
00:11:22,560 --> 00:11:23,400
Use your mouth.

243
00:11:24,700 --> 00:11:27,030
Seshita will use his mouth.

244
00:11:28,460 --> 00:11:29,450
Me?

245
00:11:29,530 --> 00:11:31,150
Nice one, Seshita.

246
00:11:31,230 --> 00:11:32,400
Why me?

247
00:11:33,100 --> 00:11:35,100
Why isn't it Hirai?

248
00:11:38,600 --> 00:11:40,000
It's moldy.

249
00:11:40,760 --> 00:11:42,280
It bothers me.

250
00:11:42,360 --> 00:11:45,030
It's not moldy. It was tasty.

251
00:11:45,600 --> 00:11:48,250
-It was moldy.
-It's fine inside.

252
00:11:49,630 --> 00:11:50,760
That's it.

253
00:11:52,160 --> 00:11:54,350
Smile, or it'll feel nervous.

254
00:11:54,430 --> 00:11:57,000
Animals can tell when you're scared.

255
00:12:01,660 --> 00:12:03,000
What's wrong?

256
00:12:05,060 --> 00:12:07,200
Put it down with your mouth.

257
00:12:07,300 --> 00:12:09,080
Seshita, go closer.

258
00:12:09,160 --> 00:12:10,560
That's it.

259
00:12:11,800 --> 00:12:13,050
Nice photo.

260
00:12:13,130 --> 00:12:14,200
Well done.

261
00:12:15,030 --> 00:12:16,530
It was wonderful.

262
00:12:17,560 --> 00:12:21,700
-Hamada, please, give it a go.
-No thanks.

263
00:12:22,430 --> 00:12:24,460
Hold my hand then.

264
00:12:25,160 --> 00:12:26,760
What's that about?

265
00:12:27,200 --> 00:12:28,450
That's weird.

266
00:12:28,530 --> 00:12:30,700
Please film it nicely.

267
00:12:30,900 --> 00:12:32,330
That's not right.

268
00:12:32,660 --> 00:12:33,730
What are you doing?

269
00:12:36,600 --> 00:12:37,730
I did it.

270
00:12:38,130 --> 00:12:39,120
How was it?

271
00:12:39,200 --> 00:12:41,260
-Good.
-See? It's fun.

272
00:12:41,600 --> 00:12:43,430
-Please touch it.
-No.

273
00:12:43,630 --> 00:12:44,730
Use your hand.

274
00:12:45,530 --> 00:12:46,630
Okay.

275
00:12:47,800 --> 00:12:49,380
-So hard.
-How do you know?

276
00:12:49,460 --> 00:12:51,700
You feel whatever he feels?

277
00:12:53,230 --> 00:12:58,460
I'm the only one who knows
that when you ate the banana,

278
00:12:58,600 --> 00:12:59,850
you got sick.

279
00:13:01,630 --> 00:13:03,820
-I know, man.
-Is that so?

280
00:13:03,900 --> 00:13:05,330
It made him sick.

281
00:13:05,530 --> 00:13:06,760
You felt sick?

282
00:13:07,030 --> 00:13:09,000
The banana did look old.

283
00:13:09,100 --> 00:13:10,380
Yeah, I thought so.

284
00:13:10,460 --> 00:13:13,000
I found out that you can eat insects,

285
00:13:13,100 --> 00:13:15,500
but never an elephant's banana.

286
00:13:16,100 --> 00:13:17,260
Never eat it.

287
00:13:17,500 --> 00:13:18,900
Never.

288
00:13:19,300 --> 00:13:23,430
Okay, now I'd like you all to embark...

289
00:13:23,700 --> 00:13:26,560
...on an elephant journey.

290
00:13:28,160 --> 00:13:29,560
He's hiding.

291
00:13:29,930 --> 00:13:30,900
Where is he?

292
00:13:31,060 --> 00:13:32,360
Where's Hamada?

293
00:13:32,700 --> 00:13:34,230
Hamada?

294
00:13:34,400 --> 00:13:35,460
Yes?

295
00:13:36,960 --> 00:13:38,760
You were here all along.

296
00:13:38,930 --> 00:13:40,260
Here he was.

297
00:13:40,430 --> 00:13:41,720
You disappeared.

298
00:13:41,800 --> 00:13:42,960
I'm here.

299
00:13:46,500 --> 00:13:48,160
-"I'm here."
-Hiding.

300
00:13:48,460 --> 00:13:50,730
Follow me for an elephant ride.

301
00:13:52,160 --> 00:13:55,900
Two people can ride on one elephant together.

302
00:13:56,700 --> 00:13:57,800
This is Thailand.

303
00:13:58,030 --> 00:14:00,150
-Taiki, you go first.
-Okay.

304
00:14:00,460 --> 00:14:02,350
I'll go with Hirai.

305
00:14:02,430 --> 00:14:04,860
Seshita and Iwahashi. Masayoshi alone.

306
00:14:05,060 --> 00:14:06,700
-Good.
-Right?

307
00:14:07,200 --> 00:14:11,450
Let's ride on an elephant.
We're at the right height for it.

308
00:14:11,530 --> 00:14:12,560
I see.

309
00:14:12,700 --> 00:14:15,530
-Cool.
-A happy elephant.

310
00:14:15,730 --> 00:14:19,430
We'll ride on it and go for a little trip.

311
00:14:19,630 --> 00:14:20,650
One question.

312
00:14:20,730 --> 00:14:22,550
How long is the trip?

313
00:14:22,630 --> 00:14:24,760
Around 60 minutes.

314
00:14:27,660 --> 00:14:30,920
Taiki, come back. Come back to us.

315
00:14:31,000 --> 00:14:32,300
Come back.

316
00:14:34,030 --> 00:14:35,500
That was sudden.

317
00:14:36,230 --> 00:14:38,120
So sudden. No violence, please.

318
00:14:38,200 --> 00:14:40,600
60 minutes? Screw that.

319
00:14:40,730 --> 00:14:43,980
I told you this was a journey on an elephant.

320
00:14:44,060 --> 00:14:46,850
Can't we go on a short trip?

321
00:14:46,930 --> 00:14:49,430
I can ask if they can make it short.

322
00:14:50,100 --> 00:14:51,830
Is that possible?

323
00:14:52,030 --> 00:14:53,630
-It's fine.
-Yeah?

324
00:14:55,100 --> 00:14:57,230
Well then, please.

325
00:14:57,430 --> 00:14:59,200
It's fun alone too.

326
00:15:00,400 --> 00:15:02,530
This is quite special.

327
00:15:02,730 --> 00:15:04,460
Very special.

328
00:15:05,430 --> 00:15:06,500
Oh wow.

329
00:15:08,800 --> 00:15:09,820
How is it?

330
00:15:09,900 --> 00:15:11,430
Jeez. What's this?

331
00:15:11,650 --> 00:15:13,020
For your safety.

332
00:15:13,100 --> 00:15:14,800
Amazing.

333
00:15:14,900 --> 00:15:16,750
It's moving.

334
00:15:19,000 --> 00:15:19,960
Wow!

335
00:15:20,800 --> 00:15:21,830
It's scary.

336
00:15:21,960 --> 00:15:23,700
It's wobbly.

337
00:15:24,100 --> 00:15:25,000
Taiki.

338
00:15:25,900 --> 00:15:28,130
It's so high up, Taiki.

339
00:15:28,700 --> 00:15:30,580
Hamada, isn't it awesome?

340
00:15:30,660 --> 00:15:31,800
Too high.

341
00:15:32,460 --> 00:15:33,760
We're riding it.

342
00:15:37,700 --> 00:15:39,060
So amazing.

343
00:15:39,230 --> 00:15:40,700
It's huge.

344
00:15:42,960 --> 00:15:44,880
Unbelievable.

345
00:15:44,960 --> 00:15:47,060
Why don't you smile and wave?

346
00:15:48,230 --> 00:15:49,660
Amazing.

347
00:15:52,100 --> 00:15:53,400
Wow.

348
00:15:54,100 --> 00:15:55,330
This is awesome.

349
00:15:56,130 --> 00:15:58,120
They can even carry Hirai.

350
00:15:58,200 --> 00:15:59,260
I know.

351
00:15:59,460 --> 00:16:04,250
-I wonder how much weight they can carry.
-I'm sure it can handle them.

352
00:16:04,500 --> 00:16:05,930
It's a bumpy ride.

353
00:16:06,130 --> 00:16:07,600
Are you having fun?

354
00:16:07,760 --> 00:16:09,050
It's quite bumpy.

355
00:16:09,130 --> 00:16:10,280
Yeah, it is.

356
00:16:10,360 --> 00:16:12,480
I can't believe how high we are.

357
00:16:12,560 --> 00:16:13,730
What's that?

358
00:16:14,460 --> 00:16:15,500
It's hot.

359
00:16:15,760 --> 00:16:18,100
It's not even that sunny though.

360
00:16:19,330 --> 00:16:22,100
When we're under the sun, right? I get it.

361
00:16:22,200 --> 00:16:24,730
-Amazing.
-It's good to have it.

362
00:16:28,100 --> 00:16:31,230
A Thai aristocrat is among us today.

363
00:16:31,930 --> 00:16:34,560
-With a parasol.
-You know him?

364
00:16:35,960 --> 00:16:38,400
It feels so insecure.

365
00:16:38,600 --> 00:16:40,130
So wobbly.

366
00:16:40,530 --> 00:16:42,530
Elephants rule!

367
00:16:44,360 --> 00:16:46,030
Look, an elephant.

368
00:16:46,960 --> 00:16:48,200
-Awesome, huh?
-Yeah.

369
00:16:48,700 --> 00:16:53,960
I think it's a great attraction.
Makes you feel like you're in Thailand.

370
00:16:54,530 --> 00:16:56,780
-We're going in the water?
-Yeah.

371
00:16:56,860 --> 00:16:58,600
No way. Really?

372
00:17:01,460 --> 00:17:02,780
I wonder how deep it is.

373
00:17:02,860 --> 00:17:05,600
It goes up and down.

374
00:17:06,930 --> 00:17:07,720
There's a monkey.

375
00:17:07,800 --> 00:17:09,100
There is.

376
00:17:11,000 --> 00:17:13,000
-It's water.
-We're going in.

377
00:17:14,130 --> 00:17:15,500
Don't fall over.

378
00:17:15,900 --> 00:17:18,080
This is really scary.

379
00:17:18,160 --> 00:17:20,660
Do elephants ever fall over?

380
00:17:23,100 --> 00:17:24,630
Oh my gosh.

381
00:17:24,730 --> 00:17:26,630
It's deeper than I thought.

382
00:17:31,900 --> 00:17:34,000
-Wow.
-Are we really going in?

383
00:17:34,080 --> 00:17:36,000
-This is quite deep.
-Right?

384
00:17:36,800 --> 00:17:38,630
It's so scary.

385
00:17:39,160 --> 00:17:40,860
Are we OK?

386
00:17:43,330 --> 00:17:44,680
This is dangerous.

387
00:17:44,760 --> 00:17:46,060
It's fun.

388
00:17:46,300 --> 00:17:48,680
The elephants are so deep in water.

389
00:17:48,760 --> 00:17:50,750
-It's scary.
-Impressive.

390
00:17:51,130 --> 00:17:53,050
We're screwed if they trip.

391
00:17:53,130 --> 00:17:55,160
Yes, totally.

392
00:17:57,430 --> 00:17:59,260
This is incredible.

393
00:17:59,500 --> 00:18:00,800
Incredible.

394
00:18:01,300 --> 00:18:02,750
The trunk is out.

395
00:18:02,830 --> 00:18:04,050
Oh yeah.

396
00:18:04,130 --> 00:18:06,000
So it can breathe.

397
00:18:06,300 --> 00:18:08,060
It's breathing like that?

398
00:18:09,630 --> 00:18:11,400
Please, get the parasol.

399
00:18:13,630 --> 00:18:15,320
Have it opened, please.

400
00:18:15,400 --> 00:18:16,800
It won't open.

401
00:18:18,960 --> 00:18:20,620
When did you close it?

402
00:18:20,700 --> 00:18:22,600
-Sorry.
-What was that?

403
00:18:22,730 --> 00:18:25,020
Wow, impressive.

404
00:18:25,100 --> 00:18:27,800
They must be two or three meters tall.

405
00:18:29,200 --> 00:18:31,660
It'll be a disaster if we fall.

406
00:18:33,300 --> 00:18:36,780
The water scares me. What if it falls over?

407
00:18:36,860 --> 00:18:37,750
It is scary.

408
00:18:37,830 --> 00:18:39,320
It might get sick.

409
00:18:39,400 --> 00:18:41,100
Can't do this in Japan.

410
00:18:43,230 --> 00:18:45,030
That was a new experience.

411
00:18:45,260 --> 00:18:47,560
It was the first time for me too.

412
00:18:50,300 --> 00:18:52,400
-Good.
-Thank you.

413
00:18:52,900 --> 00:18:55,400
-Thank you.
-Thank you.

414
00:18:59,330 --> 00:19:00,600
Wonderful.

415
00:19:01,230 --> 00:19:03,460
Thank you very much.

416
00:19:04,330 --> 00:19:06,100
That was so great.

417
00:19:06,430 --> 00:19:07,450
I enjoyed that.

418
00:19:07,530 --> 00:19:11,000
Taiki. It was totally awesome.

419
00:19:11,130 --> 00:19:12,350
-Thank you.
-Right?

420
00:19:12,430 --> 00:19:14,000
It was fun, huh?

421
00:19:14,360 --> 00:19:16,220
There's more to see.

422
00:19:16,300 --> 00:19:18,130
-Please.
-More elephants?

423
00:19:19,530 --> 00:19:21,000
Masayoshi, how was it?

424
00:19:21,560 --> 00:19:25,050
I enjoyed it, but I think
I'll come back with someone.

425
00:19:25,240 --> 00:19:27,620
Sure, I really hope you do.

426
00:19:27,700 --> 00:19:28,800
Let's go.

427
00:19:29,530 --> 00:19:32,600
More fun experience
you can't experience in Japan.

428
00:19:32,700 --> 00:19:34,900
-Please follow me.
-What is it?

429
00:19:35,000 --> 00:19:36,900
Remember this elephant?

430
00:19:37,560 --> 00:19:39,750
We're friends now. Take a look.

431
00:19:40,630 --> 00:19:41,530
Ready?

432
00:19:42,860 --> 00:19:45,100
I heard that they do this.

433
00:19:53,760 --> 00:19:54,680
Awesome!

434
00:19:54,760 --> 00:19:57,400
Isn't it incredible?

435
00:19:58,860 --> 00:19:59,900
Wow!

436
00:20:01,500 --> 00:20:03,060
That was awesome.

437
00:20:03,800 --> 00:20:06,260
I'd like you to have a go at this.

438
00:20:06,500 --> 00:20:08,100
Whoa, seriously?

439
00:20:08,180 --> 00:20:09,400
-Come on.
-Why?

440
00:20:09,700 --> 00:20:11,800
I want you to try it.

441
00:20:11,880 --> 00:20:13,900
-Are you scared?
-Very scared.

442
00:20:14,050 --> 00:20:16,230
-It's incredible.
-It was quite high.

443
00:20:17,100 --> 00:20:20,860
It's a valuable interaction with an animal.

444
00:20:20,960 --> 00:20:22,950
Please have a go.

445
00:20:23,030 --> 00:20:26,120
-Elephants are very docile, you know?
-Yeah?

446
00:20:26,200 --> 00:20:27,430
It won't bite?

447
00:20:27,700 --> 00:20:30,280
-No, it won't.
-Won't it target me?

448
00:20:30,360 --> 00:20:32,960
First, touch the elephant a bit.

449
00:20:34,760 --> 00:20:36,060
It's hard.

450
00:20:44,200 --> 00:20:45,230
Amazing!

451
00:20:46,900 --> 00:20:47,800
Looked easy.

452
00:20:48,630 --> 00:20:50,300
I was lifted in seconds.

453
00:20:51,330 --> 00:20:52,780
Because I'm light.

454
00:20:52,860 --> 00:20:55,130
-How was it?
-I felt so light.

455
00:20:55,500 --> 00:20:57,460
-It's strong.
-Yeah.

456
00:20:57,630 --> 00:20:59,200
Also because I'm light.

457
00:20:59,300 --> 00:21:00,850
It looked good.

458
00:21:00,960 --> 00:21:04,230
Oh come on. But yeah, incredible.

459
00:21:05,200 --> 00:21:08,520
All of them enjoyed this precious experience

460
00:21:08,600 --> 00:21:11,550
of being wrapped up in an elephant trunk.

461
00:21:11,630 --> 00:21:12,780
I'm falling.

462
00:21:12,860 --> 00:21:14,030
So fast.

463
00:21:14,730 --> 00:21:16,500
It's so high!

464
00:21:17,660 --> 00:21:19,100
Put me down now.

465
00:21:19,460 --> 00:21:22,030
That was high.

466
00:21:22,450 --> 00:21:23,850
-Amazing, huh?
-Yeah!

467
00:21:25,060 --> 00:21:26,230
He's heavy too.

468
00:21:28,260 --> 00:21:29,580
Such a serious face.

469
00:21:29,660 --> 00:21:31,200
-So rigid.
-Your expression!

470
00:21:31,400 --> 00:21:32,480
Why so serious?

471
00:21:32,560 --> 00:21:34,160
You worked out just now.

472
00:21:36,130 --> 00:21:38,030
It worked on my biceps.

473
00:21:38,200 --> 00:21:39,960
Good, let's go now.

474
00:21:40,330 --> 00:21:42,980
I haven't had a go. I want to have a go.

475
00:21:43,060 --> 00:21:44,430
Don't worry.

476
00:21:45,230 --> 00:21:48,020
I want to be wrapped up. Please.

477
00:21:48,100 --> 00:21:49,630
You're having fun.

478
00:21:49,730 --> 00:21:51,530
I'll lift you up then.

479
00:21:54,930 --> 00:21:56,160
You're floating.

480
00:21:57,000 --> 00:21:58,250
That's good enough.

481
00:21:58,330 --> 00:22:00,380
-Same stuff.
-No, it's not.

482
00:22:00,460 --> 00:22:01,660
It's the same.

483
00:22:02,530 --> 00:22:07,330
Tsutsumi of "Dorians" had another
experience with an elephant prepared.

484
00:22:07,660 --> 00:22:10,760
Please gather here, everybody.

485
00:22:11,130 --> 00:22:15,400
We'll have a tug-of-war with an elephant.

486
00:22:16,500 --> 00:22:21,520
I think with this many big men,
we can pull an elephant.

487
00:22:21,600 --> 00:22:22,650
I see.

488
00:22:22,730 --> 00:22:24,420
The rope is ready.

489
00:22:24,500 --> 00:22:25,450
OK.

490
00:22:25,530 --> 00:22:26,630
Let's do this.

491
00:22:27,760 --> 00:22:31,130
I wonder how strong an elephant is.

492
00:22:31,360 --> 00:22:33,150
Don't hold back, OK?

493
00:22:33,300 --> 00:22:34,300
Really?

494
00:22:34,900 --> 00:22:37,260
Hirai should be at the end.

495
00:22:37,360 --> 00:22:38,750
Hamada goes here.

496
00:22:38,830 --> 00:22:39,680
We'll go here.

497
00:22:39,760 --> 00:22:41,880
We'll go towards the end.

498
00:22:41,960 --> 00:22:43,460
Let's do this.

499
00:22:43,560 --> 00:22:44,500
Yeah.

500
00:22:44,630 --> 00:22:46,060
Flip it over.

501
00:22:46,430 --> 00:22:49,050
Don't hold back.

502
00:22:49,130 --> 00:22:50,880
Let's start.

503
00:22:50,960 --> 00:22:52,560
Ready... go!

504
00:22:53,730 --> 00:22:54,800
It's coming.

505
00:22:55,160 --> 00:22:57,100
A little more... that's it.

506
00:23:03,500 --> 00:23:04,900
No way!

507
00:23:06,160 --> 00:23:07,760
We haven't lost yet.

508
00:23:08,260 --> 00:23:11,460
-Come on.
-Stop it. We lost.

509
00:23:11,550 --> 00:23:12,400
Darn it!

510
00:23:13,400 --> 00:23:15,650
-Wow.
-That hurt.

511
00:23:15,730 --> 00:23:17,580
I'm so impressed.

512
00:23:17,660 --> 00:23:19,800
It accelerated so fast.

513
00:23:22,160 --> 00:23:25,760
Come on, Taiki.
There's no way we can win this game.

514
00:23:26,830 --> 00:23:30,750
They said we had a chance
with this many men, you know.

515
00:23:30,830 --> 00:23:33,730
No, no, we had no chance at all.

516
00:23:34,000 --> 00:23:38,820
If the ground was softer,
we could've slid forever.

517
00:23:38,900 --> 00:23:41,330
It was rough with gravel though.

518
00:23:42,160 --> 00:23:43,860
Hirai's butt's burnt.

519
00:23:44,300 --> 00:23:45,530
My butt is burnt.

520
00:23:47,860 --> 00:23:51,780
When we lost the tug-of-war,
we all let go of the rope.

521
00:23:51,860 --> 00:23:56,120
He was still on his butt, not willing to give up yet.

522
00:23:56,200 --> 00:23:57,680
I was impressed.

523
00:23:57,760 --> 00:23:59,060
Then you do it.

524
00:24:02,200 --> 00:24:03,700
You should've done it.

525
00:24:04,300 --> 00:24:05,360
You heard him.

526
00:24:05,500 --> 00:24:07,000
I'll shut up.

527
00:24:07,830 --> 00:24:09,350
Don't, Iwahashi.

528
00:24:09,430 --> 00:24:11,030
-Talk.
-Don't cry.

529
00:24:11,930 --> 00:24:13,030
This is hard.

530
00:24:15,600 --> 00:24:18,760
Who are you talking to? Come on.

531
00:24:19,330 --> 00:24:21,930
Amazing.

532
00:24:22,100 --> 00:24:26,700
It's so rare to interact
with an elephant so up close.

533
00:24:27,760 --> 00:24:30,500
Wasn't it fun? Meeting elephants?

534
00:24:34,060 --> 00:24:35,130
Great!

535
00:24:35,330 --> 00:24:38,230
It's nice to visit places.

536
00:24:38,400 --> 00:24:40,560
I liked being lifted up.

537
00:24:41,600 --> 00:24:42,480
It was good.

538
00:24:42,560 --> 00:24:43,660
I didn't do it.

539
00:24:44,850 --> 00:24:47,160
Why? It was really fun.

540
00:24:47,260 --> 00:24:48,830
You guys wouldn't let me.

541
00:24:49,030 --> 00:24:51,420
I said I wanted to do it.

542
00:24:51,500 --> 00:24:52,980
-Have Seshita do it.
-No.

543
00:24:53,060 --> 00:24:54,660
That's right.

544
00:24:54,850 --> 00:24:57,200
Alright.

545
00:25:01,360 --> 00:25:02,430
It's fun.

546
00:25:02,630 --> 00:25:04,600
Elephant Village is awesome!
