00:00:02,570 --> 00:00:06,240
This is Suiyoubi no Downtown
Hello everyone!

3
00:00:02,580 --> 00:00:04,120
MC: Hamada Masatoshi
(Downtown)

4
00:00:04,320 --> 00:00:06,420
Gekidan Hitori

5
00:00:04,320 --> 00:00:06,420
Matsumoto Hitoshi
(Downtown)

6
00:00:04,320 --> 00:00:06,420
Natsuna

7
00:00:04,320 --> 00:00:06,420
Truaden Naomi

8
00:00:06,240 --> 00:00:08,740
Our presenter will come out now

9
00:00:13,740 --> 00:00:16,810
It's Audrey's Kasuga!

10
00:00:14,260 --> 00:00:20,530
Presenter:
Kasuga Toshiaki
(Audrey)

11
00:00:16,810 --> 00:00:19,750
- Toose!
(Natsuna) So loud

12
00:00:19,750 --> 00:00:22,820
Yes, today
I shouted it louder than usual

13
00:00:22,820 --> 00:00:24,820
- Because I'm fired up
- Why?

14
00:00:24,820 --> 00:00:27,420
What I want to
say first to everyone today

15
00:00:27,420 --> 00:00:29,620
Is that this segment

16
00:00:28,810 --> 00:00:32,480
is this show's only segment.

17
00:00:31,430 --> 00:00:34,130
- Oh wow
- It's a great work

18
00:00:33,810 --> 00:00:39,950
Obon Kobon

19
00:00:34,480 --> 00:00:36,920
I bet Obon Kobon have split up

20
00:00:36,500 --> 00:00:40,100
So soon?
That would be a special, wouldn't it?

21
00:00:40,100 --> 00:00:42,610
No, it's not that but
another variety favorite

22
00:00:42,610 --> 00:00:44,890
You know the pitfall trap?

23
00:00:44,670 --> 00:00:48,110
- I've fallen into them many times
- Many times

24
00:00:48,110 --> 00:00:51,110
But generally when we do it,
the person falling

25
00:00:51,110 --> 00:00:53,180
is what we like to see. But,

26
00:00:53,180 --> 00:00:55,380
This time,

27
00:00:54,230 --> 00:00:57,540
We're going to enjoy the part after the fall

28
00:00:57,620 --> 00:00:59,620
Here it is!

29
00:00:59,600 --> 00:01:06,450
If you fall into a hole but the sun sets
without anyone coming to reveal the prank to you,
you won't be able to stay sane

30
00:01:06,630 --> 00:01:08,630
- No no no...
(Natsuna) Huh?

31
00:01:08,630 --> 00:01:10,650
That's too much

32
00:01:10,650 --> 00:01:14,220
The ones who aren't sane are the staff here

33
00:01:13,800 --> 00:01:16,640
It's a theory thought up by the insane staff, yes

34
00:01:16,640 --> 00:01:18,810
This is really--

35
00:01:17,820 --> 00:01:19,620
It's after the hole

36
00:01:18,810 --> 00:01:21,580
That's right, yes. So,

37
00:01:21,580 --> 00:01:25,250
A normal hole trap
is around 2 meters deep

38
00:01:25,250 --> 00:01:28,070
But this time we don't want
them climbing out

39
00:01:28,070 --> 00:01:32,670
So the depth is more than 3 meters

40
00:01:29,730 --> 00:01:31,090
That deep?

41
00:01:31,090 --> 00:01:33,160
It's a specially made hole

42
00:01:33,160 --> 00:01:35,160
- So you'll leave them inside…
- Correct

43
00:01:35,160 --> 00:01:37,760
- Like that?!
- No no no no no

44
00:01:37,760 --> 00:01:39,960
If they can just climb out,
it's pointless

45
00:01:39,980 --> 00:01:45,020
So today it's just people in a hole...?

46
00:01:44,270 --> 00:01:46,270
- Will that be okay?!
- Yes

47
00:01:46,270 --> 00:01:48,470
- Can I ask you something?
- Yes

48
00:01:47,750 --> 00:01:50,290
Why are you doing something like this?

49
00:01:50,340 --> 00:01:52,640
It's to see what happens

50
00:01:52,820 --> 00:01:54,630
I'm really excited

51
00:01:54,990 --> 00:01:59,600
Chiba-ken Kashiwa Shonan Yume Farm

52
00:01:55,110 --> 00:01:57,180
And so today,

53
00:01:57,180 --> 00:01:59,580
we've borrowed this camp ground

54
00:02:02,280 --> 00:02:04,550
In the deepest depths of the forest,

55
00:02:04,550 --> 00:02:06,890
which is also private property,

56
00:02:06,890 --> 00:02:09,890
somewhere people definitely won't pass

57
00:02:09,890 --> 00:02:12,190
a hole trap is set up.

58
00:02:13,560 --> 00:02:15,560
And the depth of that hole

59
00:02:15,560 --> 00:02:19,640
is an inescapable 3.3 meters.

60
00:02:19,640 --> 00:02:23,340
It's close to twice the depth of a regular hole trap.

61
00:02:25,410 --> 00:02:30,410
Falling into what could be the deepest hole
trap on a variety show,

62
00:02:30,410 --> 00:02:32,920
are our targets:

63
00:02:32,730 --> 00:02:34,770
This is Nadal from
COLOCOLO CHITTYCHITTY PEPPERS!

64
00:02:32,920 --> 00:02:34,630
COLOCOLO CHITTYCHITTY PEPPERS

65
00:02:32,920 --> 00:02:34,630
Nadal

66
00:02:34,800 --> 00:02:38,940
Ketsu

67
00:02:34,800 --> 00:02:38,940
Nippon no Shachō

68
00:02:34,920 --> 00:02:38,990
All the way from Osaka,
this is Nippon no Shachō's Ketsu!

69
00:02:38,990 --> 00:02:40,990
Hello, this is Kaerutei's Nakano!

70
00:02:39,100 --> 00:02:43,280
Kaerutei

71
00:02:39,100 --> 00:02:43,280
Nakano Shūhei

72
00:02:41,210 --> 00:02:43,280
I'm going to win and buy a house!

73
00:02:43,430 --> 00:02:46,680
Hello, this is Chance Ōshiro!

74
00:02:43,440 --> 00:02:46,680
Chance Ōshiro

75
00:02:46,850 --> 00:02:49,780
Ogata Takahiro

76
00:02:46,850 --> 00:02:49,780
Panther

77
00:02:46,910 --> 00:02:49,230
Let's go! Yeah!

78
00:02:49,780 --> 00:02:57,720
COLOCOLO CHITTYCHITTY PEPPERS -
Nadal

79
00:02:49,780 --> 00:02:57,720
Chance Ōshiro

80
00:02:49,780 --> 00:02:57,720
Kaerutei - Nakano

81
00:02:49,780 --> 00:02:57,720
Nippon no Shachou -
Ketsu

82
00:02:49,780 --> 00:02:57,720
Panther - Ogata

83
00:02:50,020 --> 00:02:57,720
First
hole
trap

84
00:02:50,150 --> 00:02:57,720
First
hole
trap

85
00:02:50,320 --> 00:02:57,720
First
hole
trap

86
00:02:50,430 --> 00:02:53,440
Ranging from hole trap veterans to virgins,

87
00:02:53,440 --> 00:02:57,240
we invited these five over
on different days.

88
00:02:58,440 --> 00:03:00,440
And the fake show is...

89
00:03:00,440 --> 00:03:06,630
a treasure-hunting battle show called
"Comedian Treasure Hunting King's Championship".

90
00:03:06,620 --> 00:03:12,050
And to make them really think
they've been forgotten,

91
00:03:12,040 --> 00:03:22,910
Dummy comedians:

92
00:03:12,040 --> 00:03:22,910
Joyman, Yutti,

(Omiotsuke) Kuroda Wakame, Oda Ueda, Koneo International, Santa Monica, Sekenshirazu

Nightingale Dance, Nature Burger, Mampuku United, (Bragoli) Daichan

93
00:03:12,050 --> 00:03:16,390
a total of 30 people will start from different places

94
00:03:16,390 --> 00:03:18,890
and then disperse,

95
00:03:18,890 --> 00:03:22,390
making a mistake by the staff
seem more likely to occur.

96
00:03:23,180 --> 00:03:25,920
They'll be like "They've forgotten me"

97
00:03:24,920 --> 00:03:27,240
Yes. And there are lots of people too.

98
00:03:27,240 --> 00:03:29,240
- Even though they fell
- Yes

99
00:03:28,790 --> 00:03:37,200
Start Point

100
00:03:28,790 --> 00:03:37,200
Hole

101
00:03:29,240 --> 00:03:31,240
And the targets

102
00:03:31,240 --> 00:03:34,240
will be traveling alone to the Start Point

103
00:03:34,240 --> 00:03:36,640
when they fall into the hole.

104
00:03:37,400 --> 00:03:38,800
Alright!

105
00:03:40,470 --> 00:03:41,970
I'm off!

106
00:03:42,830 --> 00:03:44,600
This is so rural

107
00:03:45,140 --> 00:03:47,310
What does "Gunfire warning" mean?

108
00:03:47,310 --> 00:03:51,810
Look at this? Who's shooting?

109
00:03:50,010 --> 00:03:54,010
Gunfire warning!
Please be aware
there are houses
in this area.

110
00:03:51,810 --> 00:03:54,010
This is scary

111
00:03:54,010 --> 00:03:59,080
Beware of wild dogs!
Wild dogs have been
spotted in this area.
Please do not approach
or feed them.

112
00:03:54,750 --> 00:03:57,380
What is this scary stuff?

113
00:03:57,380 --> 00:03:59,080
Wild dogs...

114
00:03:59,080 --> 00:04:09,660
Beware of wild dogs!
Wild dogs have been
spotted in this area.
Please do not approach
or feed them.

115
00:03:59,080 --> 00:04:09,660
Gunfire warning!
Please be aware
there are houses
in this area.

116
00:03:59,270 --> 00:04:01,440
Regarding these two signs,

117
00:04:01,290 --> 00:04:09,660
Fake

118
00:04:01,440 --> 00:04:03,710
the wild dog sign is fake

119
00:04:03,710 --> 00:04:09,880
but the gunfire one is real. However, this was not
filmed during the hunting season.

120
00:04:07,030 --> 00:04:09,660
Real

121
00:04:09,880 --> 00:04:12,080
Wow!

122
00:04:11,100 --> 00:04:13,230
Isn't the fake one weaker though?

123
00:04:14,200 --> 00:04:15,930
Is this the right way?

124
00:04:15,930 --> 00:04:25,940
Hole

125
00:04:15,930 --> 00:04:25,940
Start Point

126
00:04:16,390 --> 00:04:19,890
Relying on a rough treasure map,

127
00:04:21,060 --> 00:04:25,940
each of them enters the forest alone and walks for 10 minutes.

128
00:04:28,210 --> 00:04:31,320
If I fall in there, it's over..

129
00:04:32,120 --> 00:04:34,020
I'm so scared

130
00:04:52,780 --> 00:04:55,590
That voice

131
00:04:55,590 --> 00:04:58,090
And Nadal too

132
00:05:00,200 --> 00:05:02,400
Agh, ouch

133
00:05:03,480 --> 00:05:05,820
Wait a minute

134
00:05:05,820 --> 00:05:07,250
What's this?

135
00:05:07,540 --> 00:05:11,540
And then the remaining three

136
00:05:15,990 --> 00:05:17,660
Woah, what's this?!

137
00:05:19,130 --> 00:05:21,270
Woah, what's this?!

138
00:05:21,970 --> 00:05:26,400
Hey, you did it!

139
00:05:26,400 --> 00:05:27,510
Hey!

140
00:05:27,970 --> 00:05:30,080
I hate you guys

141
00:05:30,510 --> 00:05:39,080
Investigation started

142
00:05:30,630 --> 00:05:33,630
At 2pm the five targets

143
00:05:33,630 --> 00:05:39,230
take up residence in the 3-meter deep hole
and our investigation begins.

144
00:05:39,080 --> 00:05:53,000
Fixed 1

145
00:05:39,080 --> 00:05:53,000
Fixed 2

146
00:05:39,080 --> 00:05:53,000
Pinhole 1

147
00:05:39,080 --> 00:05:53,000
Pinhole 2

148
00:05:39,080 --> 00:05:53,000
Remote 1

149
00:05:39,080 --> 00:05:53,000
Remote 2

150
00:05:39,230 --> 00:05:43,070
By the way,
apart from the cameras on their person

151
00:05:43,070 --> 00:05:45,740
we've hidden some on branches
and in the hole:

152
00:05:45,740 --> 00:05:48,580
Remote cameras, fixed cameras,

153
00:05:48,580 --> 00:05:51,680
and pinhole cameras too.

154
00:05:53,500 --> 00:05:55,570
This is kind of deep

155
00:05:56,070 --> 00:05:58,370
Did I need to fall so far?

156
00:05:59,140 --> 00:06:02,010
I spent so long falling

157
00:06:02,010 --> 00:06:03,140
Hey!

158
00:06:05,080 --> 00:06:06,750
There's so many frogs here

159
00:06:07,480 --> 00:06:08,950
Poisonous frogs!

160
00:06:09,210 --> 00:06:09,610
*tut*

161
00:06:16,520 --> 00:06:17,590
5 frogs

162
00:06:18,420 --> 00:06:20,360
Here's a frog

163
00:06:21,590 --> 00:06:24,860
How cute

164
00:06:27,800 --> 00:06:29,730
There's frogs! Wait a minute!

165
00:06:29,730 --> 00:06:32,000
There's frogs! Hey!

166
00:06:32,470 --> 00:06:34,370
So many mosquitos

167
00:06:34,640 --> 00:06:36,510
There's wasps! Wasps!

168
00:06:37,040 --> 00:06:38,440
Crickets too

169
00:06:38,580 --> 00:06:39,840
A cockroach's appeared!

170
00:06:41,180 --> 00:06:43,780
Well I guess I've got them in my apartment too

171
00:06:44,070 --> 00:06:47,070
Busy marvelling at the hole's depth

172
00:06:47,070 --> 00:06:49,910
and its rich ecosystem,

173
00:06:49,910 --> 00:06:55,610
they all still think this is a
regular hole trap.

174
00:06:57,910 --> 00:07:00,110
But...

175
00:07:01,370 --> 00:07:03,400
This is taking a while. Hey!

176
00:07:03,400 --> 00:07:05,070
Hey!

177
00:07:05,770 --> 00:07:08,040
Why are the staff being so lazy?

178
00:07:08,610 --> 00:07:12,880
Why dig it if you're going to forget about it?

179
00:07:12,880 --> 00:07:14,550
Hey!

180
00:07:16,680 --> 00:07:19,480
Don't caw-caw-caw at me

181
00:07:18,930 --> 00:07:22,100
If this were a normal hole,
they'd never take so long

182
00:07:21,290 --> 00:07:23,390
Wait...

183
00:07:22,100 --> 00:07:24,300
the staff and cameras.

184
00:07:23,390 --> 00:07:26,220
I've already been here 10 minutes

185
00:07:26,880 --> 00:07:29,380
It's been 10 minutes since they fell

186
00:07:28,890 --> 00:07:33,570
and their anger towards the staff
is starting to intensify.

187
00:07:34,050 --> 00:07:36,390
And so from here,

188
00:07:36,390 --> 00:07:40,220
so that they believe this is not
a regular hole prank

189
00:07:40,220 --> 00:07:45,060
but some kind of mistake,
we've prepared more trickery.

190
00:07:45,060 --> 00:07:47,130
First...

191
00:07:47,130 --> 00:07:51,730
(Speaker) Everyone, there are 10 treasure boxes hidden
in this camp ground.

192
00:07:47,130 --> 00:07:58,620
The treasure hunt starts normally

193
00:07:51,730 --> 00:07:54,240
Please try your best to find them!

194
00:07:54,240 --> 00:07:56,740
First stage - start!

195
00:07:59,490 --> 00:08:01,530
It's weird the staff haven't come yet

196
00:08:01,530 --> 00:08:02,860
This must be an accident

197
00:08:03,160 --> 00:08:06,060
Wait, why is no one here?

198
00:08:06,060 --> 00:08:07,700
What show is this...?

199
00:08:07,700 --> 00:08:10,870
Doing this is so incompetent

200
00:08:10,870 --> 00:08:13,240
I don't even know what show it is

201
00:08:13,760 --> 00:08:18,690
Gradually they start to fear something has happened

202
00:08:18,690 --> 00:08:21,700
Then, 30 minutes later,

203
00:08:21,810 --> 00:08:33,630
The treasure hunt ends normally

204
00:08:23,700 --> 00:08:27,200
The first stage is over!

205
00:08:27,200 --> 00:08:29,870
It's time for those who didn't find a treasure box

206
00:08:29,870 --> 00:08:31,940
to leave the grounds.

207
00:08:31,940 --> 00:08:34,040
Good work!

208
00:08:34,260 --> 00:08:36,090
Huh? She said they're leaving

209
00:08:36,090 --> 00:08:37,430
Wait a minute

210
00:08:37,700 --> 00:08:40,770
Am I just going to be left here?

211
00:08:41,330 --> 00:08:45,040
Staff!

212
00:08:45,040 --> 00:08:48,870
I'm here! It's Panther's Ogata!

213
00:08:48,870 --> 00:08:51,710
I've fallen into a hole!

214
00:08:52,230 --> 00:08:57,130
The possibility that they may be left behind
is starting to feel more and more real.

215
00:08:58,070 --> 00:09:01,570
Then after another 15 minutes,

216
00:09:01,420 --> 00:09:04,420
They hear the sound of the crew leaving

217
00:09:04,690 --> 00:09:06,220
Cars!

218
00:09:06,220 --> 00:09:07,430
I hear cars!

219
00:09:07,430 --> 00:09:09,090
Hey!

220
00:09:09,090 --> 00:09:10,190
Wait!

221
00:09:10,190 --> 00:09:11,160
Wait wait wait wait

222
00:09:11,160 --> 00:09:13,200
I'll do it now. One moment

223
00:09:15,470 --> 00:09:18,070
Hey, wait a second

224
00:09:18,070 --> 00:09:19,240
I hate you guys! Damn

225
00:09:19,240 --> 00:09:21,510
You've really done it now

226
00:09:21,510 --> 00:09:23,440
Hey!

227
00:09:32,320 --> 00:09:35,050
What's going on ...

228
00:09:35,700 --> 00:09:42,040
At this point they've
spent at least an hour in the hole

229
00:09:42,460 --> 00:09:44,760
The staff have gone home for sure

230
00:09:44,760 --> 00:09:46,660
This place is huge

231
00:09:46,660 --> 00:09:48,870
Why would you film here?

232
00:09:49,500 --> 00:09:52,070
The wild dogs are going to come out

233
00:09:52,370 --> 00:09:56,070
Have you forgotten this?

234
00:09:56,070 --> 00:10:00,140
If you have, this show's going to be awful

235
00:10:00,730 --> 00:10:07,240
The suspicion that they've been forgotten
turns into certainty for some

236
00:10:07,240 --> 00:10:09,390
And then...

237
00:10:09,390 --> 00:10:10,960
Oh

238
00:10:11,820 --> 00:10:14,230
Wait a moment

239
00:10:16,030 --> 00:10:18,960
Something's been left here. Look

240
00:10:19,700 --> 00:10:21,370
It's something about hole traps

241
00:10:21,730 --> 00:10:23,600
"King of Chair"?

242
00:10:23,080 --> 00:10:25,680
(Nakano) 2010?

243
00:10:26,100 --> 00:10:27,610
What is this?

244
00:10:27,770 --> 00:10:30,640
He thinks it's been there since then

245
00:10:30,090 --> 00:10:33,090
- Wow
- This is elaborate

246
00:10:33,280 --> 00:10:36,480
Could this be a hole from a TV show from 11 years ago?

247
00:10:37,280 --> 00:10:40,990
Did I fall into a hole they abandoned 10 years ago?

248
00:10:41,100 --> 00:10:46,860
Yes, we want them to think that this hole was created for an old TV show full of such traps called "King of Chair"...

249
00:10:41,920 --> 00:10:52,630
"King of Chair"

250
00:10:46,860 --> 00:10:51,640
and then forgotten about.

251
00:10:53,400 --> 00:10:54,630
This is scary

252
00:10:54,620 --> 00:10:57,290
It's becoming real now

253
00:10:57,290 --> 00:11:01,290
To achieve this,
we created the hole a month ago

254
00:11:01,270 --> 00:11:04,180
and aged it artificially

255
00:11:04,230 --> 00:11:06,230
Furthermore, inside it

256
00:11:06,230 --> 00:11:11,580
we buried things that appear to have
fallen in 11 years ago

257
00:11:12,020 --> 00:11:16,090
Huh, so this isn't a prank? This kind of thing...

258
00:11:16,090 --> 00:11:18,360
Did I just happen to fall in?

259
00:11:19,790 --> 00:11:23,190
This is really something made for TV, isn't it?

260
00:11:23,910 --> 00:11:28,530
Oh man, I started paying into my pension recently. Is this divine punishment?

261
00:11:28,900 --> 00:11:31,940
Hey! Help!

262
00:11:32,940 --> 00:11:34,870
Help!

263
00:11:34,870 --> 00:11:46,580
Fake show from another TV network



Cars departed from production company's building




A shoot that the staff might forget easily



18 dummy comedians




Materials from 11 years ago in the hole



At the start they were free to choose a start point from numbers 1 to 30 but
whichever number they chose they were given one of 30 maps
that directed them to the hole

264
00:11:34,870 --> 00:11:46,580
The details of today's prank

265
00:11:34,990 --> 00:11:37,760
With this intricate deception,

266
00:11:37,760 --> 00:11:39,830
almost all members think they've

267
00:11:39,540 --> 00:11:46,580
had an extremely rare accident with an old hole trap.

268
00:11:46,670 --> 00:11:49,370
Except for this man

269
00:11:50,190 --> 00:11:51,890
I've had enough

270
00:11:52,460 --> 00:11:55,530
This is messed up

271
00:11:55,530 --> 00:11:56,730
I give up

272
00:11:57,230 --> 00:11:59,160
Stupid mosquitos

273
00:11:59,160 --> 00:12:01,900
Insect spray

274
00:12:01,900 --> 00:12:03,430
Give me some

275
00:12:03,740 --> 00:12:05,770
Lady AD

276
00:12:05,770 --> 00:12:07,970
Get me some tea

277
00:12:08,240 --> 00:12:15,110
He still has no doubt that this is a prank

278
00:12:15,730 --> 00:12:20,130
At this point 1 hours and 30 minutes
have elapsed since they fell

279
00:12:21,570 --> 00:12:27,240
The members,
sensing that no help is coming

280
00:12:27,240 --> 00:12:31,440
attempt to somehow escape by themselves.

281
00:12:40,070 --> 00:12:41,740
Damn...

282
00:12:41,740 --> 00:12:43,240
This is slippery

283
00:12:47,910 --> 00:12:50,050
Ahh, frogs! There are frogs, look

284
00:12:50,330 --> 00:12:54,270
But the weak foothold,

285
00:12:54,270 --> 00:12:57,770
3.3 meter wall,

286
00:12:57,770 --> 00:13:00,540
and just in case,
oiled wall,

287
00:13:00,540 --> 00:13:03,340
leave them at their wits' end.

288
00:13:03,530 --> 00:13:06,160
This is disgusting

289
00:13:06,550 --> 00:13:11,220
And so it began.
The prank on the other side of the fall

290
00:13:11,220 --> 00:13:14,920
What will be the fate of the five of them?!

291
00:13:15,890 --> 00:13:18,960
I see. That's the start

292
00:13:18,960 --> 00:13:21,260
Wait, "the fate of the five of them"?

293
00:13:21,680 --> 00:13:24,780
Aren't we going to help them?

294
00:13:24,730 --> 00:13:26,800
This is amazing

295
00:13:26,800 --> 00:13:28,800
- Amazing
- It is

296
00:13:28,800 --> 00:13:32,410
There's so many fine details.
They really believe it

297
00:13:32,410 --> 00:13:35,240
From the old show,
showing them that

298
00:13:35,240 --> 00:13:37,240
It's elaborate

299
00:13:36,860 --> 00:13:39,500
It's like Squid Game

300
00:13:39,860 --> 00:13:44,070
What did the staff oil the walls for?

301
00:13:43,780 --> 00:13:44,820
Also

302
00:13:44,820 --> 00:13:47,820
Out of the dummy
comedians you used

303
00:13:47,820 --> 00:13:50,470
Poor Yutti

304
00:13:47,940 --> 00:13:59,150
Yutti

305
00:13:50,430 --> 00:13:52,430
- He was there?
- He wasn't on screen long

306
00:13:52,430 --> 00:13:55,430
Well-known comedians like
Yutti and Joyman

307
00:13:52,840 --> 00:13:59,150
Joyman

308
00:13:55,430 --> 00:13:59,100
Ah, so you used proper
comedians

309
00:13:59,100 --> 00:14:02,100
To make it real

310
00:14:00,350 --> 00:14:02,850
They'll believe this

311
00:14:02,950 --> 00:14:07,360
If a skull comes out now, that's it

312
00:14:05,110 --> 00:14:07,280
- Yeah…
- That'd be so scary

313
00:14:07,280 --> 00:14:10,130
Like a number of people
had met a similar fate there

314
00:14:24,710 --> 00:14:29,780
Today's investigation
is planned to last 6 hours until 8pm

315
00:14:29,780 --> 00:14:33,080
But after only 2 hours...

316
00:14:34,320 --> 00:14:37,890
I've fallen down a hole. It seems like a long time ago

317
00:14:38,760 --> 00:14:41,190
Damn it

318
00:14:41,630 --> 00:14:43,590
I'm tired

319
00:14:43,590 --> 00:14:45,360
and hungry

320
00:14:45,500 --> 00:14:49,170
Calm down. Just calm down

321
00:14:49,170 --> 00:14:52,440
My mind's all over the place

322
00:14:52,440 --> 00:14:54,540
Just calm down

323
00:14:54,540 --> 00:14:55,840
Enya-san, Enya...

324
00:14:55,840 --> 00:14:58,080
I'll sing Enya

325
00:15:02,610 --> 00:15:05,550
Calm. I have to be calm

326
00:15:11,490 --> 00:15:12,860
Frog!

327
00:15:14,760 --> 00:15:17,330
Oh no, the GoPro's gone

328
00:15:18,130 --> 00:15:21,600
I stepped on the GoPro

329
00:15:21,600 --> 00:15:24,140
The GoPro's broken!

330
00:15:25,500 --> 00:15:27,940
Wow

331
00:15:27,940 --> 00:15:29,970
I said enough

332
00:15:30,210 --> 00:15:36,720
Nadal uses his trademark lying
to try to lure out the staff to no avail

333
00:15:36,720 --> 00:15:39,720
Three hours have now passed since they fell

334
00:15:39,720 --> 00:15:43,560
The time is 5pm

335
00:15:44,820 --> 00:15:47,160
The GoPro's died

336
00:15:48,090 --> 00:15:50,530
Whatever

337
00:15:50,900 --> 00:15:54,530
Nadal's lies turn into reality

338
00:15:54,730 --> 00:15:59,640
I don't know anymore. The lens is brown

339
00:15:59,640 --> 00:16:01,110
Sorry

340
00:16:01,110 --> 00:16:03,510
I don't know anymore. Sorry, camera people

341
00:16:07,280 --> 00:16:10,110
Hey, the camera died

342
00:16:10,510 --> 00:16:11,680
This is it

343
00:16:11,680 --> 00:16:13,620
This is my last chance

344
00:16:14,020 --> 00:16:16,150
In the name of the father, son, and holy spirit

345
00:16:16,150 --> 00:16:18,520
Our father who art in heaven. Hallowed be thy name

346
00:16:18,520 --> 00:16:21,790
Thy kingdom come, thy will be done, as in heaven and on earth

347
00:16:21,790 --> 00:16:23,860
Holy Mary, Mother of God, pray for us sinners,

348
00:16:23,890 --> 00:16:26,860
now, and at the hour of our death. Amen.

349
00:16:42,880 --> 00:16:45,880
Chance's prayers go unanswered

350
00:16:47,250 --> 00:16:49,920
I'm numb

351
00:16:53,320 --> 00:16:57,230
It's no good. I'm going to die of dehydration

352
00:16:57,570 --> 00:17:02,670
Then, Nadal's lying spreads to another man

353
00:17:02,870 --> 00:17:09,910
3 hours ago

354
00:17:03,530 --> 00:17:07,170
I finished all my tea. So dumb

355
00:17:08,240 --> 00:17:09,910
I'm thirsty

356
00:17:10,180 --> 00:17:12,680
Then...

357
00:17:12,210 --> 00:17:15,550
I'll show you the spirit of an Amagasaki brown rat

358
00:17:20,650 --> 00:17:23,590
It's full of moisture

359
00:17:26,090 --> 00:17:30,230
Amazingly the wet fallen leaves supply moisture

360
00:17:30,430 --> 00:17:32,260
There's moisture!

361
00:17:32,530 --> 00:17:36,040
The time is 5:30pm

362
00:17:36,040 --> 00:17:38,140
Sunset at last

363
00:17:38,870 --> 00:17:41,410
Seriously?

364
00:17:41,410 --> 00:17:43,470
Which show is this?

365
00:17:45,540 --> 00:17:49,350
My leg's broken

366
00:17:49,550 --> 00:17:52,080
He knows these tactics are pointless

367
00:17:52,380 --> 00:17:56,350
It got caught on something weird and broke

368
00:17:56,350 --> 00:18:02,630
Excuse my. My leg... ouch

369
00:18:02,630 --> 00:18:21,280
Chance

370
00:18:02,630 --> 00:18:21,280
Ketsu

371
00:18:02,630 --> 00:18:21,280
Nadal

372
00:18:02,630 --> 00:18:21,280
Nakano
Shūhei

373
00:18:02,630 --> 00:18:21,280
Ogata

374
00:18:02,630 --> 00:18:21,280
The degree to which they think it's an accident

375
00:18:02,900 --> 00:18:07,570
At this point, one person
thinks it's a TV show prank:

376
00:18:07,570 --> 00:18:09,570
Nadal.

377
00:18:09,570 --> 00:18:14,240
Two are unsure if it's real or fake:
Nakano and Ketsu

378
00:18:14,240 --> 00:18:17,250
And two are completely convinced
it's an accident:

379
00:18:17,250 --> 00:18:20,750
Ogata and Chance.

380
00:18:21,750 --> 00:18:24,590
Of the two sure
it's an accident,

381
00:18:24,590 --> 00:18:28,660
Chance is trying to
stay alive in the hole

382
00:18:28,660 --> 00:18:31,360
Whereas Ogata...

383
00:18:33,060 --> 00:18:36,260
I'm going to climb it

384
00:18:36,260 --> 00:18:37,960
Let's go

385
00:18:38,430 --> 00:18:41,430
He resolves to climb out by himself

386
00:18:43,500 --> 00:18:47,510
And so he ties his jersey
together into a rope

387
00:18:47,370 --> 00:18:53,410
Rope 5m from
the bottom of the hole

388
00:18:47,510 --> 00:18:50,510
trying to hook it on a
rope passing over the hole

389
00:18:50,510 --> 00:18:53,780
so he can climb out.

390
00:18:53,780 --> 00:18:55,780
Then...

391
00:18:56,480 --> 00:18:58,580
Agh, this is the worst

392
00:18:59,620 --> 00:19:01,720
(Ogata) Agh, the worst

393
00:19:02,190 --> 00:19:04,990
This is horrible

394
00:19:05,520 --> 00:19:08,030
He threw it without
holding onto one side

395
00:19:08,760 --> 00:19:13,560
and loses it.

396
00:19:11,570 --> 00:19:14,240
(Ogata) The worst

397
00:19:14,240 --> 00:19:17,310
Whereas Kaerutei's Nakano...

398
00:19:17,310 --> 00:19:22,510
No longer hoping for salvation
or escape, he's sleeping

399
00:19:22,940 --> 00:19:25,740
What am I meant to do here?

400
00:19:25,740 --> 00:19:29,280
It's just me in a hole

401
00:19:29,280 --> 00:19:31,720
How is that funny?

402
00:19:31,920 --> 00:19:39,330
With no jersey, Ogata
ties together all his clothes and helmet

403
00:19:39,330 --> 00:19:42,760
to make an even longer rope

404
00:19:42,760 --> 00:19:46,160
Naked and determined to try again

405
00:19:57,450 --> 00:20:03,220
But it seems unlikely it can
reach the rope 5 meters away

406
00:20:03,210 --> 00:20:07,990
4 hours since they fell

407
00:20:03,220 --> 00:20:05,720
As this is happening,

408
00:20:05,720 --> 00:20:08,220
the area turns pitch black.

409
00:20:08,250 --> 00:20:11,390
So this is my life now

410
00:20:11,390 --> 00:20:13,860
I'm not sure what's happening

411
00:20:14,430 --> 00:20:18,630
I'm losing strength for some reason

412
00:20:19,500 --> 00:20:21,330
So many mosquitoes

413
00:20:21,740 --> 00:20:25,240
After being woken up by bugs, Nakano→

414
00:20:25,240 --> 00:20:28,310
devises anti-insect countermeasures

415
00:20:28,310 --> 00:20:31,010
and then goes back to sleep

416
00:20:32,740 --> 00:20:35,410
Audio person, sorry. I'm borrowing this

417
00:20:35,550 --> 00:20:40,220
Waist pouch for
pin microphone

418
00:20:35,920 --> 00:20:39,920
Using the waist pouch for his
pin microphone,

419
00:20:39,920 --> 00:20:44,420
Ogata improves his homemade rope
by making it even longer

420
00:20:51,900 --> 00:20:53,930
Close

421
00:20:54,270 --> 00:20:58,970
He continues trying,
with 27 attempts

422
00:21:08,080 --> 00:21:10,210
It's hooked

423
00:21:10,720 --> 00:21:13,050
Making a hook with the helmet,

424
00:21:13,050 --> 00:21:16,850
At last he's connected
with the overhead rope

425
00:21:19,590 --> 00:21:21,130
Ah, what to do...

426
00:21:24,030 --> 00:21:25,500
Aaahhhh!

427
00:21:25,900 --> 00:21:28,230
Defeat

428
00:21:28,470 --> 00:21:31,400
Shit!

429
00:21:37,780 --> 00:21:39,410
What's happening here?

430
00:21:39,410 --> 00:21:41,950
What a boring project

431
00:21:41,950 --> 00:21:44,580
It's the most boring project I've ever seen

432
00:21:45,080 --> 00:21:47,020
Let me out

433
00:21:47,420 --> 00:21:50,930
The time is 6.30pm

434
00:21:50,930 --> 00:21:57,100
At this point we induce even
more fear with new tactics

435
00:21:56,790 --> 00:22:00,200
Beware of wild dogs!
Wild dogs have been
spotted in this area.
Please do not approach
or feed them.

436
00:21:56,830 --> 00:22:00,200
A dog barking

437
00:22:01,100 --> 00:22:03,300
Isn't that a wild dog?

438
00:22:09,540 --> 00:22:13,040
He puts his helmet on,
just in case

439
00:22:16,450 --> 00:22:19,080
Woof

440
00:22:19,080 --> 00:22:21,720
Woof woof

441
00:22:21,720 --> 00:22:22,950
Woof woof woof

442
00:22:23,120 --> 00:22:25,890
He intimidates the dog

443
00:22:25,890 --> 00:22:27,960
Then...

444
00:22:27,320 --> 00:22:30,290
Gunfire warning!
Please be aware
there are houses
in this area.

445
00:22:27,320 --> 00:22:30,290
Gunshots

446
00:22:30,930 --> 00:22:32,630
Gunshots?

447
00:22:54,920 --> 00:22:58,760
Five hours have passed since they fell

448
00:22:58,760 --> 00:23:01,200
It's 7pm

449
00:23:01,200 --> 00:23:05,400
Ogata the primitive man's
rope has another success

450
00:23:11,270 --> 00:23:14,040
Ah, looks good

451
00:23:14,040 --> 00:23:16,140
- Can he？
- He can

452
00:23:17,470 --> 00:23:19,640
Agh, so close!

453
00:23:20,710 --> 00:23:22,710
Agh, so close!

454
00:23:23,810 --> 00:23:29,220
Defeat

455
00:23:24,390 --> 00:23:26,390
Damn it!

456
00:23:29,390 --> 00:23:34,390
After that, even though he's able to get his rope
to hook onto the other one

457
00:23:35,730 --> 00:23:40,400
the hook is unable to
support Ogata's body weight.

458
00:23:40,400 --> 00:23:43,070
But, after 2 hours

459
00:23:43,070 --> 00:23:46,070
the man who continued
trying non-stop

460
00:23:46,070 --> 00:23:49,670
receives a huge win.

461
00:24:03,850 --> 00:24:05,390
Come down

462
00:24:07,960 --> 00:24:09,560
Good

463
00:24:08,800 --> 00:24:10,960
He got the rope

464
00:24:11,230 --> 00:24:13,960
Yes. Yes yes yes yes

465
00:24:14,200 --> 00:24:17,530
I got it

466
00:24:18,040 --> 00:24:20,440
OK OK OK OK

467
00:24:20,440 --> 00:24:28,280
Post

468
00:24:20,440 --> 00:24:28,280
Tree

469
00:24:20,710 --> 00:24:23,610
The rope came off the post on one side

470
00:24:23,770 --> 00:24:28,150
and now hangs like a
spider's thread from heaven

471
00:24:28,510 --> 00:24:31,580
I got it. Yes!

472
00:24:32,380 --> 00:24:34,850
What do I do with it?

473
00:24:34,040 --> 00:24:36,380
It's a bit thin

474
00:24:36,420 --> 00:24:38,420
I've got it

475
00:24:38,420 --> 00:24:44,530
That's it. I've got it. Alright

476
00:24:44,730 --> 00:24:47,070
Making a loop with the rope

477
00:24:47,070 --> 00:24:49,070
he creates a foothold

478
00:24:49,070 --> 00:24:51,670
exhibiting an uncharacteristic level of wisdom.

479
00:24:53,700 --> 00:24:55,840
I had an epiphany

480
00:24:56,080 --> 00:24:58,080
And then

481
00:25:04,580 --> 00:25:07,350
Ah, I can't. It hurts

482
00:25:07,350 --> 00:25:09,050
The top's slippery

483
00:25:09,260 --> 00:25:18,130
After five and a half hours his hand finally reaches the ground 3 meters above him

484
00:25:16,200 --> 00:25:18,200
Ouch

485
00:25:26,040 --> 00:25:29,670
Huh? Huh?

486
00:25:30,510 --> 00:25:32,610
Come on...

487
00:25:33,380 --> 00:25:35,250
No, stop

488
00:25:39,920 --> 00:25:43,120
Stop, stop

489
00:25:43,750 --> 00:25:47,790
Really?!

490
00:25:48,060 --> 00:25:53,130
He's literally lost his lifeline

491
00:25:58,470 --> 00:26:00,400
No way...

492
00:26:04,910 --> 00:26:09,680
As for the other survivor, Chance Ōshiro

493
00:26:10,180 --> 00:26:12,750
I'm thirsty

494
00:26:13,190 --> 00:26:18,320
And then he does something unbelievable
which we cannot broadcast

495
00:26:18,590 --> 00:26:20,290
Wow

496
00:26:20,360 --> 00:26:22,360
- Incredible
- (Naomi) Wow

497
00:26:22,360 --> 00:26:25,260
(Naomi) It's really amazing

498
00:26:26,760 --> 00:26:28,930
5 hours and 45 minutes since they fell

499
00:26:29,900 --> 00:26:32,200
What time is it?

500
00:26:32,600 --> 00:26:36,610
Anyone, even someone like an old guy I don't know is fine

501
00:26:36,610 --> 00:26:37,510
Help me

502
00:26:37,670 --> 00:26:39,780
It won't be long before something like that

503
00:26:40,070 --> 00:26:44,940
So, in response to the request

504
00:26:53,060 --> 00:26:54,460
Aaaahh!

505
00:26:58,330 --> 00:27:00,660
Please help me

506
00:27:00,660 --> 00:27:02,700
Do you have a rope ("himo")?

507
00:27:03,770 --> 00:27:05,470
Sweet potato ("imo")?

508
00:27:05,540 --> 00:27:08,810
Himo. "Hi-"

509
00:27:09,340 --> 00:27:11,110
Imo?

510
00:27:10,040 --> 00:27:11,110
Himo

511
00:27:11,740 --> 00:27:12,380
Imo?

512
00:27:12,580 --> 00:27:14,510
Not imo

513
00:27:14,540 --> 00:27:19,480
We send in an
old man with conversational difficulties

514
00:27:19,480 --> 00:27:23,450
Imo

515
00:27:20,420 --> 00:27:21,820
Himo

516
00:27:21,820 --> 00:27:23,450
"Hi-"

517
00:27:23,450 --> 00:27:24,890
OK fine. Imo please. Imo

518
00:27:24,890 --> 00:27:26,620
Imo please

519
00:27:26,620 --> 00:27:30,330
Imo is fine too. I'm hungry. Roasted imo

520
00:27:29,660 --> 00:27:30,330
I don't get it

521
00:27:30,330 --> 00:27:33,160
Why don't you understand it anymore?

522
00:27:33,230 --> 00:27:36,670
Hey you old fart

523
00:27:34,870 --> 00:27:36,870
Mind your words

524
00:27:37,790 --> 00:27:44,400
As the last trick, each will get a different kind of character throw in

525
00:27:44,400 --> 00:27:48,470
And following from there we will reveal the prank

526
00:27:48,470 --> 00:27:52,270
Next, for Chance...

527
00:27:53,680 --> 00:27:57,890
Aaaahh! Aah ah ah. Huh?

528
00:27:57,920 --> 00:28:03,060
Foreigner who can't speak Japanese

529
00:27:58,250 --> 00:28:00,450
(Chance) Who are you?

530
00:28:06,430 --> 00:28:07,760
A ghost?

531
00:28:07,760 --> 00:28:11,570
Aaaah! Wait a moment. Wait a moment

532
00:28:12,030 --> 00:28:17,330
As usual, Chance exceeds
our expectations

533
00:28:17,440 --> 00:28:21,750
Glory to the Sutra, Glory to the Sutra, Glory to...

534
00:28:21,750 --> 00:28:24,780
Let me into Nirvana quickly please. Let me in...

535
00:28:29,320 --> 00:28:31,460
Are you a ghost?

536
00:28:33,620 --> 00:28:35,790
Huh?

537
00:28:35,790 --> 00:28:36,990
Are you human?

538
00:28:36,990 --> 00:28:38,960
Are you currently alive?

539
00:28:42,200 --> 00:28:45,170
Are you foreign?

540
00:28:45,300 --> 00:28:49,570
Ah, then, you're an actively serving person?
You're actively serving as a human, right?

541
00:28:50,310 --> 00:28:52,310
A currently serving human?

542
00:28:52,710 --> 00:28:54,410
Could you pull me out?

543
00:28:56,650 --> 00:28:57,650
Huh?

544
00:28:57,880 --> 00:29:00,550
You only have to help me once

545
00:29:00,550 --> 00:29:01,790
We can talk after

546
00:29:03,020 --> 00:29:05,820
Oh oh aahhh wait

547
00:29:05,820 --> 00:29:08,590
(Misspoken) No way! Hey!

548
00:29:09,020 --> 00:29:12,620
Next is Nakano

549
00:29:19,070 --> 00:29:20,870
Help me

550
00:29:20,900 --> 00:29:25,480
Speechless child

551
00:29:25,700 --> 00:29:28,400
And then for Ketsu

552
00:29:32,450 --> 00:29:33,780
Oh my god

553
00:29:38,360 --> 00:29:40,520
Ah, could you tell me who you are?

554
00:29:44,730 --> 00:29:48,060
Huh?

555
00:29:48,060 --> 00:29:49,570
Good evening

556
00:29:49,570 --> 00:29:53,540
Speechless old man

557
00:29:51,700 --> 00:29:53,540
Are you from around here?

558
00:29:58,440 --> 00:30:01,810
Who are you?

559
00:30:05,020 --> 00:30:09,090
I don't know what you're going to do so I'm a bit scared...

560
00:30:16,290 --> 00:30:19,500
This is so scary

561
00:30:19,500 --> 00:30:21,260
It's so bad

562
00:30:21,360 --> 00:30:24,360
And last is Ogata

563
00:30:24,360 --> 00:30:28,700
But because he's still struggling
with his escape attempt,

564
00:30:28,700 --> 00:30:30,700
we decide not
to interfere,

565
00:30:28,710 --> 00:30:34,340
Director with communication difficulties

566
00:30:28,710 --> 00:30:34,340
Planned character

567
00:30:30,700 --> 00:30:33,700
and to see what
happens for a bit longer.

568
00:30:34,700 --> 00:30:37,700
And so, 6 hours since they fell,

569
00:30:37,700 --> 00:30:39,710
for the remaining four...

570
00:30:39,280 --> 00:30:41,710
we reveal the prank now

571
00:30:50,960 --> 00:30:52,030
We done?

572
00:30:53,300 --> 00:30:54,930
So smooth

573
00:30:55,200 --> 00:30:57,630
What is this?

574
00:30:57,630 --> 00:31:01,040
(Staff) It's Suiyoubi no Downtown

575
00:30:58,270 --> 00:31:01,040
Thought so

576
00:31:01,040 --> 00:31:03,310
It was so long

577
00:31:03,310 --> 00:31:05,340
Wh- what is this?

578
00:31:05,340 --> 00:31:08,010
The one where you send in the angry old fart?

579
00:31:08,010 --> 00:31:09,610
What was that? Seriously

580
00:31:09,740 --> 00:31:14,550
We explain the project to Nadal

581
00:31:14,550 --> 00:31:18,520
Staff) Nadal-san, today's project was to spend 6 hours in a hole

582
00:31:16,790 --> 00:31:18,520
6 hours

583
00:31:18,990 --> 00:31:21,760
I came here intending to win prize money, you know

584
00:31:21,760 --> 00:31:26,960
It's just going to be the normal appearance fee with this

585
00:31:26,960 --> 00:31:31,570
Downtown-san, we'll only get 10000 yen for all the work we do

586
00:31:31,840 --> 00:31:34,170
Staff) I suppose you want to use the toilet now?

587
00:31:34,170 --> 00:31:37,110
Please don't ask me that question so calmly. "Want to"?

588
00:31:37,110 --> 00:31:39,910
I've been stuck here for 6 hours, haven't I?

589
00:31:40,140 --> 00:31:43,610
It's not "want to use the toilet?"

590
00:31:43,610 --> 00:31:47,220
Staff) At the end there...

591
00:31:44,450 --> 00:31:47,220
Enough of this. Are you going to let me out?

592
00:31:47,370 --> 00:31:50,070
Next is Nakano

593
00:31:47,550 --> 00:31:49,850
Prank Reveal

594
00:31:49,950 --> 00:31:51,690
Ah, oh my god

595
00:31:51,690 --> 00:31:52,520
It's...

596
00:31:53,420 --> 00:31:56,260
Is it over? Can I finish this now?

597
00:31:56,790 --> 00:31:58,060
(Staff) How do you feel now?

598
00:31:58,060 --> 00:32:01,670
How I feel? Horrible!

599
00:32:01,770 --> 00:32:04,670
Above ground for the first time in 6 hours

600
00:32:07,800 --> 00:32:09,040
I'm happy

601
00:32:09,040 --> 00:32:11,370
So deep!

602
00:32:13,010 --> 00:32:14,980
Prank Reveal

603
00:32:13,330 --> 00:32:15,830
Next is Ketsu

604
00:32:17,250 --> 00:32:20,080
Oh my god

605
00:32:21,150 --> 00:32:23,290
(Staff) Good evening

606
00:32:23,290 --> 00:32:25,560
Good evening

607
00:32:27,220 --> 00:32:28,980
His eyes

608
00:32:29,590 --> 00:32:34,190
Ketsu shows Kingdom-level shock

609
00:32:35,600 --> 00:32:41,640
Um, earlier, an old man I don't know came here

610
00:32:40,500 --> 00:32:41,640
Staff) What?

611
00:32:41,640 --> 00:32:44,210
An old man I don't know

612
00:32:43,270 --> 00:32:44,210
Staff) Who was it?

613
00:32:44,210 --> 00:32:45,810
I don't know

614
00:32:46,030 --> 00:32:48,370
Next is Chance

615
00:32:46,140 --> 00:32:48,380
Prank Reveal

616
00:32:48,370 --> 00:32:50,370
Huh?

617
00:32:50,550 --> 00:32:53,380
What?

618
00:32:53,850 --> 00:32:58,560
Huh? What?

619
00:33:02,030 --> 00:33:04,090
What is this?

620
00:33:04,160 --> 00:33:09,530
Someone's here. I'm happy. Someone's here

621
00:33:09,700 --> 00:33:12,940
I've been buried in a mountain before. 27 years ago

622
00:33:12,940 --> 00:33:14,940
Staff) Is that so?

623
00:33:13,400 --> 00:33:14,940
Yes

624
00:33:14,940 --> 00:33:18,710
But this was probably harder than back then

625
00:33:19,710 --> 00:33:23,010
Ah, I'm happy. Yay!

626
00:33:23,010 --> 00:33:25,080
Woah, there's so many people

627
00:33:25,080 --> 00:33:26,520
Thank you so much everyone

628
00:33:26,520 --> 00:33:28,890
Everyone, thank you very much. Thank you

629
00:33:28,920 --> 00:33:33,890
After all he's been through, he unexpectedly kneels down on the ground in gratitude

630
00:33:34,250 --> 00:33:38,750
And so, what is the fate of the
one person remaining, Ogata?

631
00:33:41,020 --> 00:33:43,090
- Wow amazing
- Yes

632
00:33:43,090 --> 00:33:45,090
- Wow
- So then...

633
00:33:45,090 --> 00:33:47,690
Matsumoto-san, what did you think?

634
00:33:47,690 --> 00:33:52,030
They didn't really say "help me!",
even when they saw people

635
00:33:52,030 --> 00:33:54,870
That's right, yes

636
00:33:54,870 --> 00:33:56,940
- They thought it was a ghost
- Yes

637
00:33:56,940 --> 00:34:01,880
Either that or the person
who made the hole

638
00:34:01,880 --> 00:34:06,310
They thought for a moment
"is this something he does to people?"

639
00:34:06,310 --> 00:34:08,310
- Would they think that?
- Isn't it scary?

640
00:34:08,260 --> 00:34:10,330
Like "I've been caught in this person's trap"

641
00:34:09,980 --> 00:34:11,990
- Yes
- That's also possible

642
00:34:11,990 --> 00:34:15,320
Like he's done it to them. Definitely

643
00:34:15,320 --> 00:34:17,660
Oh and also,
Ogata-kun's rope

644
00:34:17,660 --> 00:34:19,660
- It came off the tree, right?
- Yes

645
00:34:19,660 --> 00:34:22,840
I have a hunch the staff did it

646
00:34:21,730 --> 00:34:24,160
Yeah! It was tightly
bound to it at the start

647
00:34:24,160 --> 00:34:28,000
Right? They were like 'Ah, he's
going to escape! Someone untie it'

648
00:34:28,000 --> 00:34:30,000
The staff here seem
like they'd do that

649
00:34:30,000 --> 00:34:32,010
I'm sure that's not true

650
00:34:32,010 --> 00:34:34,310
- Is that so?

651
00:34:33,180 --> 00:34:36,190
It feels like they just cut the end of the rope

652
00:34:35,340 --> 00:34:37,340
- Suspicious, isn't it?
- It is

653
00:34:37,340 --> 00:34:39,350
They wouldn't go so far

654
00:34:39,350 --> 00:34:41,350
Ah, but I wanted him to escape

655
00:34:41,350 --> 00:34:44,550
Yeah. Just a bit more and he could've done it

656
00:34:44,230 --> 00:34:48,800
So we've made an exception for Ogata

657
00:34:45,440 --> 00:34:48,350
- That's right. For Ogata-kun,
it's become something to escape

658
00:34:48,350 --> 00:34:50,150
Just to see what happens

659
00:35:04,680 --> 00:35:07,350
6 hours since falling

660
00:35:07,890 --> 00:35:11,390
After the rope, which had been his
only hope up to this point,

661
00:35:11,390 --> 00:35:15,070
came loose from the tree
it had been attached to,

662
00:35:15,070 --> 00:35:18,370
Ogata was in despair.
However...

663
00:35:22,670 --> 00:35:25,340
I won't give up!

664
00:35:27,340 --> 00:35:30,710
I've got this rope now so

665
00:35:30,710 --> 00:35:32,440
I'm going to be positive

666
00:35:33,250 --> 00:35:37,850
Not discouraged from this harsh situation,

667
00:35:37,850 --> 00:35:39,920
he ties together his helmet and the rope

668
00:35:39,920 --> 00:35:42,520
and creates a new item.

669
00:35:43,420 --> 00:35:47,490
He aims for above ground once more

670
00:35:49,030 --> 00:35:51,130
And then...

671
00:35:53,100 --> 00:35:56,100
Wow, the distance
is totally different

672
00:35:58,370 --> 00:36:02,010
He makes his biggest throw of the day

673
00:36:02,010 --> 00:36:09,810
Rope

674
00:36:02,010 --> 00:36:09,810
Wire

675
00:36:03,050 --> 00:36:07,440
He succeeds in getting it
caught on a strong wire

676
00:36:07,440 --> 00:36:09,680
over twice as far as
the original rope

677
00:36:10,720 --> 00:36:12,720
However...

678
00:36:15,190 --> 00:36:16,620
Damn it

679
00:36:17,390 --> 00:36:19,400
The connection is too weak

680
00:36:19,400 --> 00:36:21,400
and it comes off straightaway.

681
00:36:22,630 --> 00:36:24,890
It's fine. It's not electric

682
00:36:24,890 --> 00:36:26,130
It'll do

683
00:36:26,470 --> 00:36:30,030
After confirming there's no risk of electric shock,

684
00:36:30,170 --> 00:36:33,170
Ogata starts trying again

685
00:36:34,240 --> 00:36:36,250
And so here we have

686
00:36:36,250 --> 00:36:39,550
his 113th throw of the day

687
00:36:47,860 --> 00:36:50,690
By skilfully
rotating the rope

688
00:36:50,690 --> 00:36:54,190
he manages to get it caught
and attached to wire

689
00:36:54,960 --> 00:36:56,690
Alright!

690
00:36:57,030 --> 00:36:59,370
Then by passing the other end→

691
00:36:59,370 --> 00:37:03,570
through a metal fixture
he discovered inside the hole,

692
00:37:05,710 --> 00:37:08,380
he makes the rope taut

693
00:37:08,380 --> 00:37:11,380
and completes a suspension
bridge to the surface.

694
00:37:17,050 --> 00:37:19,050
However...

695
00:37:20,280 --> 00:37:22,050
Ouch, my foot hurts

696
00:37:22,420 --> 00:37:24,790
It hurts and I've got no strength

697
00:37:25,400 --> 00:37:28,730
Because he's putting his
whole body weight on the thin rope

698
00:37:28,730 --> 00:37:33,430
his aching hands and feet mean
he's unable to climb and he gives up

699
00:37:35,230 --> 00:37:38,000
Ouch, my leg's got a cramp

700
00:37:40,470 --> 00:37:42,110
Ouch

701
00:37:42,680 --> 00:37:47,510
And then Ogata devises his next plan

702
00:37:47,810 --> 00:37:56,650
Screwdriver substitute

703
00:37:50,350 --> 00:37:53,850
Using the end of a zipper
as a screwdriver,

704
00:37:53,850 --> 00:37:55,850
he takes a screw out of the wall

705
00:38:00,700 --> 00:38:02,700
Seriously?

706
00:38:02,700 --> 00:38:04,700
Amazing

707
00:38:04,700 --> 00:38:08,100
By cutting through the
thick protective sheet

708
00:38:09,040 --> 00:38:12,380
and digging out the
styrofoam inside

709
00:38:12,380 --> 00:38:18,740
he creates footholds
to climb with

710
00:38:19,040 --> 00:38:26,780
Foothold

711
00:38:19,220 --> 00:38:22,420
Planning to use both
of these to make his jailbreak,

712
00:38:19,410 --> 00:38:26,780
Taut rope

713
00:38:22,710 --> 00:38:26,780
it's Ogata, the wrongly convicted lifer

714
00:38:28,730 --> 00:38:30,730
And then...

715
00:38:42,340 --> 00:38:45,680
Distributing his body weight
between the rope and foothold,

716
00:38:45,680 --> 00:38:48,340
and steadier than ever

717
00:38:48,340 --> 00:38:51,340
he reaches the top of the hole

718
00:39:05,590 --> 00:39:09,060
I'm not going to give up

719
00:39:07,030 --> 00:39:09,370
Wow, so cool

720
00:39:09,060 --> 00:41:07,080
Attempt number

721
00:39:09,370 --> 00:39:12,070
And then,
after that

722
00:39:14,930 --> 00:39:16,830
Aaaahhh

723
00:39:19,110 --> 00:39:23,310
Ogata just keeps attacking

724
00:39:26,210 --> 00:39:28,580
Damn it!

725
00:39:28,580 --> 00:39:30,780
Damn it! Ugh

726
00:39:31,050 --> 00:39:33,050
And then...

727
00:39:42,230 --> 00:39:45,030
He finally holds the edge
with both hands

728
00:40:01,480 --> 00:40:02,980
Like that?

729
00:40:02,980 --> 00:40:05,600
It can't be possible

730
00:40:05,050 --> 00:40:07,150
Aaagh

731
00:40:07,820 --> 00:40:10,950
My hands can't hold it anymore

732
00:40:28,710 --> 00:40:30,650
While climbing the wall,

733
00:40:30,650 --> 00:40:33,320
he makes more footholds
in ever higher places.

734
00:40:33,320 --> 00:40:36,150
No matter how many times
he fails, ittle by little→

735
00:40:36,150 --> 00:40:40,650
Ogata's getting closer to the surface.

736
00:40:44,660 --> 00:40:46,660
However...

737
00:40:49,690 --> 00:40:50,730
Huh?

738
00:40:54,000 --> 00:40:56,010
Huh?

739
00:40:56,010 --> 00:40:59,680
The rope he worked so hard to
get caught on the wire comes off

740
00:40:59,680 --> 00:41:01,970
It's the worst thing
that could've happen

741
00:41:02,040 --> 00:41:07,080
No way, it's breaking

742
00:41:13,360 --> 00:41:16,420
Then, holding the screw in his mouth,

743
00:41:16,420 --> 00:41:23,930
Ogata resumes his attack using the remaining climbing-only route

744
00:41:23,930 --> 00:41:39,980
Attempt number

745
00:41:46,990 --> 00:41:49,330
- He's crying
- He's crying

746
00:41:49,330 --> 00:41:51,660
- It's disappointing

747
00:41:53,660 --> 00:41:56,330
Because he
got so close

748
00:41:56,330 --> 00:41:59,340
It's already been 7 hours since he fell

749
00:41:59,340 --> 00:42:01,670
Ogata's mind and body

750
00:42:01,670 --> 00:42:04,170
are reaching breaking point.

751
00:42:07,680 --> 00:42:10,680
While the staff are preparing→

752
00:42:10,680 --> 00:42:14,020
to rescue him and reveal the prank→

753
00:42:14,020 --> 00:42:16,320
if the need rises

754
00:42:20,690 --> 00:42:24,030
Ogata stands up once more.

755
00:42:24,030 --> 00:42:26,360
He won't give up.
He's really something

756
00:42:26,360 --> 00:42:28,860
- He's a tough guy
- Can he do it?

757
00:42:31,530 --> 00:42:33,730
And then...!

758
00:42:39,810 --> 00:42:42,480
- Come on, come on!
- Go!

759
00:42:57,660 --> 00:43:01,360
Ogata's magnificent escape!

760
00:43:17,410 --> 00:43:19,410
What is this?

761
00:43:19,410 --> 00:43:22,140
What are you doing?

762
00:43:22,140 --> 00:43:24,580
I'm so annoyed

763
00:43:28,020 --> 00:43:30,490
What's funny about this?

764
00:43:32,360 --> 00:43:34,920
It has to be Suiyoubi no Downtown, right?

765
00:43:34,420 --> 00:43:36,230
(Staff) Yes

766
00:43:34,920 --> 00:43:36,230
Of course it is

767
00:43:36,230 --> 00:43:39,330
Were you planning to leave me in there for a week?

768
00:43:39,330 --> 00:43:43,630
(Staff) We weren't really expecting you to climb out...

769
00:43:42,100 --> 00:43:43,630
Isn't it...

770
00:43:43,630 --> 00:43:46,240
You wanted me to climb out, didn't you?

771
00:43:46,240 --> 00:43:49,110
(Staff) This wasn't about climbing out

772
00:43:49,110 --> 00:43:51,010
But I did it before. At the smoking area

773
00:43:51,310 --> 00:43:53,740
Smoking area

774
00:43:51,710 --> 00:43:53,710
(Ogata)
Wasn't this like that?

775
00:43:54,710 --> 00:43:57,410
(Staff) What was the hardest part?

776
00:43:56,310 --> 00:43:57,410
All of it

777
00:43:57,410 --> 00:44:01,420
My hands hurt, it was slippery

778
00:44:01,420 --> 00:44:03,320
I reached my limit

779
00:44:03,320 --> 00:44:05,520
I can't feel my hands anymore

780
00:44:05,520 --> 00:44:09,490
It was really tough. The toughest thing I've ever done

781
00:44:10,690 --> 00:44:13,560
I'm completely out of strength

782
00:44:13,730 --> 00:44:15,100
(Staff) Good work

783
00:44:15,100 --> 00:44:16,370
(Staff) Thank you. Well done

784
00:44:16,370 --> 00:44:17,770
Thank you...

785
00:44:17,770 --> 00:44:20,540
(Staff) How about some water and a shower?

786
00:44:32,650 --> 00:44:35,420
What's this going to look like? I'm naked

787
00:44:35,420 --> 00:44:39,560
(Staff) We'll put a mosaic on for that

788
00:44:39,560 --> 00:44:42,290
Was it funny?

789
00:44:40,720 --> 00:44:42,290
(Staff) Yes, it's fine

790
00:44:42,290 --> 00:44:44,630
(Staff) It was funny

791
00:44:44,930 --> 00:44:50,300
And so Ogata, after 7 hours and 12 minutes,
makes a safe journey home

792
00:44:51,210 --> 00:44:53,210
He was angry

793
00:44:53,210 --> 00:44:55,210
Yes he was

794
00:44:55,210 --> 00:44:57,210
Of course he was angry

795
00:44:56,310 --> 00:44:58,410
He looked like a hero

796
00:44:58,210 --> 00:45:00,720
I couldn't hold back my tears

797
00:45:00,720 --> 00:45:02,650
- He was so cool
- So cool

798
00:45:02,650 --> 00:45:04,790
I came here expecting
something light

799
00:45:04,790 --> 00:45:08,720
- Right?
- I never thought I'd be moved this much

800
00:45:08,720 --> 00:45:11,560
- You're right
- But it really was amazing

801
00:45:11,560 --> 00:45:13,560
I was just thinking but→

802
00:45:13,590 --> 00:45:17,390
Do we really need the mosaic there?

803
00:45:15,560 --> 00:45:17,570
No, sorry.
It is TV after all

804
00:45:17,570 --> 00:45:21,070
- But because it's so moving
- Exactly

805
00:45:21,500 --> 00:45:25,070
It felt like we were watching The Shawshank Redemption

806
00:45:25,410 --> 00:45:27,410
- The jailbreak one?
- You're right

807
00:45:27,410 --> 00:45:29,410
We were all rooting
for him at the end

808
00:45:29,410 --> 00:45:31,710
We really were

809
00:45:29,970 --> 00:45:33,010
Ogata's inspired the whole country

810
00:45:32,580 --> 00:45:34,580
You're right. He didn't give up

811
00:45:34,580 --> 00:45:37,480
- Amazing
- I really admire him

812
00:45:37,880 --> 00:45:40,820
Next time will we make the hole 8 meters?

813
00:45:39,660 --> 00:45:42,360
- Would we do this again?
- So good

814
00:45:42,850 --> 00:46:14,820

00:45:43,350 --> 00:45:45,760
Next week, it's an
Everyone's Theories Special

816
00:45:45,940 --> 00:45:50,280
Can a pro wrestler hold his fountain opponent down until the count of three?

817
00:45:50,280 --> 00:45:52,280
- Hold on Nadal, hold on
- OK

818
00:45:52,280 --> 00:45:55,280
Will they stay on hold
for their senpai for 10 minutes?

819
00:45:55,280 --> 00:45:57,290
And...

820
00:45:57,290 --> 00:45:59,290
Is harvesting the
bontan fruit

821
00:45:57,300 --> 00:46:01,800
TL note: I'll explain next time

822
00:45:59,290 --> 00:46:01,960
also called bontan hunting?

823
00:46:01,960 --> 00:46:04,290
And the ineffective megaphone theory

824
00:46:04,290 --> 00:46:07,960
All the detailed theories we've
accumulated will be released at once!

825
00:46:07,960 --> 00:46:09,960
Shut up!
