You fools...

11
00:00:18,080 --> 00:00:19,630
Okay, so today...

12
00:00:20,900 --> 00:00:22,540
The losers had to do a Batsu Game,

13
00:00:22,970 --> 00:00:24,100
so that happened...

14
00:00:24,280 --> 00:00:26,410
And this really was something...

15
00:00:27,720 --> 00:00:29,280
So let's get the losers out here

16
00:00:30,120 --> 00:00:30,600
Come in!

17
00:00:39,830 --> 00:00:41,690
Well well well everyone

18
00:00:41,880 --> 00:00:42,330
Yup!

19
00:00:43,090 --> 00:00:44,260
It was a magnificent

20
00:00:44,260 --> 00:00:44,780
Yup...

21
00:00:45,570 --> 00:00:47,240
Batsu Game apparently...

22
00:00:47,700 --> 00:00:50,860
So ummm... Our team morale is really low right now...

23
00:00:50,860 --> 00:00:52,130
So ummm... Our team morale is really low right now...

24
00:00:52,780 --> 00:00:53,520
You're right

25
00:00:53,030 --> 00:00:54,780
We're so sorry...

26
00:00:53,040 --> 00:00:56,350
Yeah I mean I went to greet you guys a few times during the Batsu Game...

27
00:00:56,520 --> 00:01:00,080
But damn, it was like a nest for old men

28
00:01:00,080 --> 00:01:00,600
But damn, it was like a nest for old men

29
00:01:00,690 --> 00:01:01,950
Just a nest of old men, right?

30
00:01:03,870 --> 00:01:07,560
And I've heard rumours from a few of the guys and we've done a lot of Batsu Games in the past

31
00:01:07,880 --> 00:01:11,170
But this was the toughest one, according to them anyway...

32
00:01:11,230 --> 00:01:11,970
Oh for sure...

33
00:01:11,370 --> 00:01:12,050
Seriously...

34
00:01:12,830 --> 00:01:14,050
That Batsu was just...

35
00:01:14,160 --> 00:01:14,920
Don't speak, Tanaka...

36
00:01:17,020 --> 00:01:17,810
Damn man, your voice...

37
00:01:17,620 --> 00:01:19,250
Don't worry, you can speak...

38
00:01:19,350 --> 00:01:20,660
He was talking through his nose, right?

39
00:01:20,270 --> 00:01:21,490
You're speaking through your nose so much, so don't speak

40
00:01:22,170 --> 00:01:23,520
It's the effects of the Batsu Game, right?

41
00:01:22,950 --> 00:01:25,550
Yeah seriously, it's down to that Batsu Game!

42
00:01:25,970 --> 00:01:27,360
It was literally that severe a Batsu Game!

43
00:01:27,360 --> 00:01:28,590

And their faces show some nerves

52
00:01:45,100 --> 00:01:46,320
And their faces show some nerves

53
00:01:55,500 --> 00:01:56,560
Don't film me fucking first thing in the morning!

Damn man, this really is scary...

Yeah, still at this point...

162
00:05:41,790 --> 00:05:42,810

163
00:05:43,540 --> 00:05:44,490
We've just started after all...

164
00:05:52,660 --> 00:05:54,470
Wait wait wait....

165
00:06:03,630 --> 00:06:04,800

00:06:05,470 --> 00:06:07,080
This was the scary one

168
00:06:07,080 --> 00:06:08,710
This one scared the shit out of us, right guys?

169
00:06:09,920 --> 00:06:13,350
Shit, shit, shit... Why me?!

170
00:06:16,140 --> 00:06:16,930
What what what?!

171
00:06:16,140 --> 00:06:16,940
What the hell is this?

172
00:06:17,260 --> 00:06:17,700
What's going on?

173
00:06:18,930 --> 00:06:19,730
What what what?!

174
00:06:20,550 --> 00:06:21,440

What... what?!

176
00:06:26,330 --> 00:06:27,010
You got to be kidding me...

177
00:06:27,070 --> 00:06:28,710
This really is something...

178
00:06:28,930 --> 00:06:31,560
And because he's wearing his bloody shoes, it really hurts...

179
00:06:30,990 --> 00:06:31,850
Hamada-san, are you okay?

180
00:06:35,390 --> 00:06:35,960
This is...

181
00:06:38,040 --> 00:06:38,960
This is a bit...

182
00:06:39,750 --> 00:06:41,510
This is much worse than I thought...

183
00:06:43,420 --> 00:06:44,080
Are you okay?

184
00:06:49,700 --> 00:06:50,060
It's only been 3 minutes since we started

Hold on a minute...

188
00:06:54,240 --> 00:06:54,850
We're going to die...

189
00:06:55,440 --> 00:06:56,300
We will...

190
00:06:55,710 --> 00:06:57,570
This is amazing, this early in the morning...

191
00:06:56,590 --> 00:06:57,550
It is...

192
00:06:57,690 --> 00:06:58,330
I...

193
00:07:00,040 --> 00:07:02,210
I received all 3 punishments...

194
00:07:02,530 --> 00:07:04,470
You did as well...

195
00:07:05,420 --> 00:07:06,390
It was so painful...

196
00:07:07,950 --> 00:07:08,870
It was so painful...

197
00:07:11,650 --> 00:07:13,820
Do you think they'll let me go home?

198
00:07:14,400 --> 00:07:15,510
It's been about 3 minutes...

199
00:07:16,690 --> 00:07:18,210
Just running is hard enough...

200
00:07:18,920 --> 00:07:19,880
Yeah it is.

201
00:07:19,880 --> 00:07:20,900
I feel physically sick...

202
00:07:20,900 --> 00:07:21,550
Really?

203
00:07:23,890 --> 00:07:24,940
Wait Yamasaki, how old are you?

204
00:07:25,490 --> 00:07:26,550
I'm 32...

205
00:07:30,450 --> 00:07:31,500
And you guys are twenty...

206
00:07:31,600 --> 00:07:32,060
eight

207
00:07:32,060 --> 00:07:32,740
Eight...

208
00:07:34,770 --> 00:07:35,250
And you, Hamada-san?

209
00:07:35,250 --> 00:07:36,120
You're the youngest here...

210
00:07:37,020 --> 00:07:38,010
Hamada-san, how old are you this year?

211
00:07:38,450 --> 00:07:38,980
37...

212
00:07:41,550 --> 00:07:43,160
Damn Hamada-san, you're turning 37 already?

213
00:07:46,560 --> 00:07:48,560
Seriously, I think my ribs have gone

214
00:07:48,620 --> 00:07:49,940
Oh here we go again...

215
00:07:49,420 --> 00:07:50,350
No, seriously

216
00:07:50,390 --> 00:07:51,610
Give us a break...

217
00:07:50,730 --> 00:07:55,060
Yamasaki claims that he has fractured

218
00:07:50,730 --> 00:07:55,060
his ribs

219
00:07:52,980 --> 00:07:53,410
For real?

220
00:07:53,440 --> 00:07:55,290
You said recently that your rib was broken as well...

221
00:07:55,700 --> 00:07:56,300
Yeah, that's right...

222
00:07:56,370 --> 00:07:56,810
No no

223
00:07:57,190 --> 00:07:58,180
It's definitely...

224
00:07:58,170 --> 00:07:59,170
It's not broken, but it's definitely fractured

225
00:07:59,170 --> 00:08:01,170
It's not broken, but it's definitely fractured

226
00:08:00,640 --> 00:08:01,590
What, from just before?

227
00:08:03,400 --> 00:08:04,350
You just fell over...

228
00:08:05,270 --> 00:08:06,790
You fractured it just from that?

229
00:08:06,680 --> 00:08:08,120
There's no way it's fractured

230
00:08:07,860 --> 00:08:09,120
No... Seriously, my body is like that

231
00:08:09,120 --> 00:08:10,070
No... Seriously, my body is like that

232
00:08:11,420 --> 00:08:12,690
You couldn't have broken it just by that...

233
00:08:12,870 --> 00:08:13,350
No no

234
00:08:13,350 --> 00:08:14,420
It's not broken, but it's fractured

235
00:08:14,420 --> 00:08:16,420
It's not broken, but it's fractured

236
00:08:16,390 --> 00:08:17,790
Seriously...

237
00:08:17,530 --> 00:08:19,150
Damn, you really are trying to push the "fracture" thing, huh?

238
00:08:21,110 --> 00:08:23,350
Man I'm so pissed, I'm running away, seriously...

239
00:08:24,390 --> 00:08:26,000
Doing this for 24 hours...

240
00:08:26,250 --> 00:08:28,000
It's going to be so tough on me...

241
00:08:27,690 --> 00:08:29,460
There's no way it's fractured...

242
00:08:29,640 --> 00:08:30,890
No, but like seriously...

243
00:08:30,960 --> 00:08:33,470
It would have to have been something severe for there to be a fracture...

244
00:08:41,340 --> 00:08:43,220
Please don't do that!!!

245
00:08:43,420 --> 00:08:44,520
I was just practicing...

246
00:08:44,210 --> 00:08:45,510
Why?!

247
00:08:44,550 --> 00:08:45,550
I got so scared!

248
00:08:45,520 --> 00:08:46,770
Please don't do that!

249
00:08:47,120 --> 00:08:48,890
Please tell us you're going to practice then!

250
00:08:48,270 --> 00:08:49,470
Oh okay, sorry my bad...

251
00:08:49,470 --> 00:08:50,230
Oh man...

252
00:08:50,270 --> 00:08:51,950
Let's not do this to each other...

253
00:08:55,020 --> 00:08:55,690
See, it's not fractured, is it?

254
00:08:55,690 --> 00:08:57,690
See, it's not fractured, is it?

255
00:08:57,270 --> 00:08:58,310
But your movement was totally fine...

256
00:08:59,150 --> 00:09:01,080
There was nothing wrong with you, after all...

257
00:09:02,380 --> 00:09:03,540
Okay fine, show me...

258
00:09:03,350 --> 00:09:04,340
He's definitely lying...

259
00:09:05,510 --> 00:09:06,090
What the hell..?

260
00:09:06,700 --> 00:09:07,850
Wait, where are you going, I'll smack you!

261
00:09:07,850 --> 00:09:09,000
Wait, where are you going, I'll smack you!

262
00:09:09,580 --> 00:09:10,100
What is it?

263
00:09:10,710 --> 00:09:11,320
Come, gather around these boobies

264
00:09:11,320 --> 00:09:12,720
Come, gather around these boobies

265
00:09:13,190 --> 00:09:13,680
What the hell..?

266
00:09:16,950 --> 00:09:17,550
I brought you your breakfast

267
00:09:17,550 --> 00:09:19,550
I brought you your breakfast

268
00:09:17,920 --> 00:09:18,420
Oh, for real?

269
00:09:18,420 --> 00:09:18,930
Oh, for real?

270
00:09:19,630 --> 00:09:22,170
Even for the likes of you, Matsumoto-san said

271
00:09:22,190 --> 00:09:23,520
that he would feed you

272
00:09:23,520 --> 00:09:24,840
that he would feed you

273
00:09:26,120 --> 00:09:26,860
He really is as kind as the Buddha himself

274
00:09:26,860 --> 00:09:28,530
He really is as kind as the Buddha himself

275
00:09:28,750 --> 00:09:29,620
But before you eat

276
00:09:31,410 --> 00:09:33,180
"Even for the likes of us, you have given food, Matsumoto-san, thank you very much

277
00:09:33,180 --> 00:09:35,240
"Even for the likes of us, you have given food, Matsumoto-san, thank you very much

278
00:09:35,240 --> 00:09:36,490
"Even for the likes of us, you have given food, Matsumoto-san, thank you very much

279
00:09:36,490 --> 00:09:37,620
Even for the likes of us, you have given food, Matsumoto-san, thank you very much

280
00:09:38,420 --> 00:09:39,280
Once you've said that, you may eat

281
00:09:39,900 --> 00:09:41,550
Even for the likes of us

282
00:09:43,130 --> 00:09:43,730
Together now..

283
00:09:46,250 --> 00:09:47,910
Even for the likes of us

284
00:09:48,490 --> 00:09:50,600
Even for the likes of us

285
00:09:52,480 --> 00:09:54,540
you have given us food

286
00:09:54,540 --> 00:09:55,640
you have given us food

287
00:09:55,640 --> 00:09:56,300
I'm so hungry right now...

288
00:09:57,460 --> 00:10:00,790
you have given us food...

289
00:10:01,430 --> 00:10:02,290
Matsumoto-san

290
00:10:03,350 --> 00:10:04,420
Matsumoto-san...

291
00:10:04,880 --> 00:10:05,970
Thank you very much

292
00:10:07,220 --> 00:10:08,540
Thank you very much

293
00:10:09,800 --> 00:10:15,140
30 minutes since the start

294
00:10:09,800 --> 00:10:15,140
8:30 AM

295
00:10:09,800 --> 00:10:15,140
Breakfast time

296
00:10:11,320 --> 00:10:13,390
Why the hell do I have to eat breakfast feeling so nervous?

297
00:10:19,310 --> 00:10:24,120
Unsure of when an Oni may appear,

298
00:10:19,310 --> 00:10:24,120
they keep their shoes on...

299
00:10:23,730 --> 00:10:25,550
We couldn't take our shoes off right? Cause we didn't know when they could come

300
00:10:24,860 --> 00:10:25,380
That's right

301
00:10:25,180 --> 00:10:25,750
Yeah...

302
00:10:25,550 --> 00:10:26,630
Cause we didn't know when they could come

303
00:10:27,910 --> 00:10:28,580
What the hell, man...

304
00:10:30,970 --> 00:10:32,480
For crying out loud, please stop that kind of thing!

305
00:10:31,970 --> 00:10:33,000
What's going on?

306
00:10:32,660 --> 00:10:33,450
No, you got it all wrong

307
00:10:33,800 --> 00:10:34,590
This guy...

308
00:10:34,700 --> 00:10:37,590
Come on, man...

309
00:10:35,290 --> 00:10:36,960
You're overreacting way too much...

310
00:10:36,410 --> 00:10:39,120
No, of course I would be shocked...

311
00:10:38,910 --> 00:10:39,550
No, it's not like that

312
00:10:40,050 --> 00:10:41,310
The lighter for my cigarette slipped and hit here

313
00:10:41,310 --> 00:10:43,690
The lighter for my cigarette slipped and hit here

314
00:10:43,690 --> 00:10:46,440
The lighter for my cigarette slipped and hit here

315
00:10:47,420 --> 00:10:48,890
So I was like "Oh shit"...

316
00:10:50,900 --> 00:10:51,890
Please stop that kind of thing...

317
00:10:52,450 --> 00:10:53,540
Like seriously...

318
00:10:54,080 --> 00:10:56,400
Just moving like that once is so tiring...

319
00:10:59,060 --> 00:11:00,870
Sorry man...

320
00:11:01,330 --> 00:11:02,530
That's not cool...

321
00:11:01,650 --> 00:11:06,960
The group even reacts to Hamada's fart

322
00:11:03,260 --> 00:11:03,990
Did you get scared?

323
00:11:03,990 --> 00:11:06,620
Yes! I thought the Oni were coming from over there this time...

324
00:11:06,390 --> 00:11:07,950
If you're going to fart, tell us all, okay?

325
00:11:08,340 --> 00:11:08,940
From here on

326
00:11:09,660 --> 00:11:11,790
Why is my bum going off now..?

327
00:11:17,670 --> 00:11:20,840
One blow

328
00:11:20,360 --> 00:11:21,700
That's amazing though...

329
00:11:33,330 --> 00:11:34,310
I'm begging you

330
00:11:42,310 --> 00:11:44,260
You're finished right, you're finished now right?

331
00:11:47,180 --> 00:11:48,030
You're finished, right?

332
00:12:05,830 --> 00:12:06,710
Are you serious right now..?

333
00:12:07,200 --> 00:12:08,240
He's coming again?

334
00:12:08,480 --> 00:12:09,440
Wait a minute, man...

335
00:12:12,730 --> 00:12:15,140
Hamada-san, what are you doing?!

336
00:12:32,720 --> 00:12:34,220
This is serious, man...

337
00:12:34,380 --> 00:12:35,780
This is... yeah...

338
00:12:35,780 --> 00:12:36,620
This is bad...

339
00:12:37,950 --> 00:12:38,220
Hamada-san, did you try and use me as a shield before?

340
00:12:38,220 --> 00:12:39,150
Hamada-san, did you try and use me as a shield before?

341
00:12:39,150 --> 00:12:40,820
Hamada-san, did you try and use me as a shield before?

342
00:12:41,450 --> 00:12:42,160
You're imagining things...

343
00:12:42,020 --> 00:12:42,730
Am I imagining things?..

344
00:12:43,850 --> 00:12:45,550
I could've sworn Hamada-san tried to use me as a shield...

345
00:12:45,550 --> 00:12:47,260
I could've sworn Hamada-san tried to use me as a shield...

346
00:12:47,260 --> 00:12:48,700
I could've sworn Hamada-san tried to use me as a shield...

347
00:12:49,880 --> 00:12:51,290
My apologies; I must be imagining things...

348
00:12:51,290 --> 00:12:51,750
No problem...

349
00:12:52,860 --> 00:12:55,290
Hamada-san, what are you doing?!

350
00:12:53,420 --> 00:12:53,900
See?

351
00:12:53,770 --> 00:12:58,540
Dirty Hamada tries to use Endo

352
00:12:53,770 --> 00:12:58,540
as a shield

353
00:12:58,910 --> 00:13:03,240
1 hour since the start

354
00:12:58,910 --> 00:13:03,240
9:00 AM

355
00:13:03,530 --> 00:13:06,540
If everyone ran and one of us just sat here and pretended not to be here,

356
00:13:07,140 --> 00:13:08,160
do you not think we'll be safe?

357
00:13:08,160 --> 00:13:09,380
Oh hell no...

358
00:13:10,220 --> 00:13:15,560
"Hide from the oni using the kotatsu" plan

359
00:13:10,220 --> 00:13:15,560
Planning stages

360
00:13:10,580 --> 00:13:11,290
Why?

361
00:13:11,500 --> 00:13:12,470
Yamasaki, try it.

362
00:13:13,630 --> 00:13:14,690
No way...

363
00:13:14,870 --> 00:13:16,180
Just sit here and don't move...

364
00:13:17,670 --> 00:13:19,670
We actually might be able to get away with it...

365
00:13:19,740 --> 00:13:20,210
Right?

366
00:13:20,260 --> 00:13:20,560
Yes

367
00:13:20,760 --> 00:13:22,080
No...

368
00:13:21,780 --> 00:13:24,280
Because they'll chase the thing that's running away from them

369
00:13:24,330 --> 00:13:25,110
Yeah exactly

370
00:13:25,130 --> 00:13:25,800
I honestly believe

371
00:13:25,800 --> 00:13:26,640
Yeah, when you see something running

372
00:13:28,620 --> 00:13:30,960
Just please, try it once

373
00:13:28,640 --> 00:13:29,790
It might work...

374
00:13:31,310 --> 00:13:34,190
Wait a second, why do I have to do it?

375
00:13:33,280 --> 00:13:34,960
You never know...

376
00:13:34,530 --> 00:13:35,890
Let's do rock-paper-scissors...

377
00:13:36,270 --> 00:13:36,620
What?

378
00:13:36,710 --> 00:13:37,280
Rock-paper-scissors...

379
00:13:37,500 --> 00:13:38,180
Shall we?

380
00:13:38,250 --> 00:13:38,750
Yeah...

381
00:13:42,910 --> 00:13:44,030
No, guys, it's only him!

382
00:13:47,050 --> 00:13:48,470
What the hell is with this noise!?

383
00:13:48,470 --> 00:13:50,210
Come, gather around these boobs!

384
00:13:49,800 --> 00:13:50,950
Enough, man!

385
00:13:50,260 --> 00:13:51,090
What the hell is with that?

386
00:13:51,270 --> 00:13:52,520
He's really getting to us with it...

387
00:13:53,500 --> 00:13:54,780
Here. Matsumoto-san said,

388
00:13:54,780 --> 00:13:56,830
Here. Matsumoto-san said,

389
00:13:57,670 --> 00:13:59,700
"Your haemorrhoids seem to be bothering you, so take this."

390
00:13:59,700 --> 00:14:01,370
"Your haemorrhoids seem to be bothering you, so take this."

391
00:14:01,430 --> 00:14:02,790
This is the one I brought along with me this morning...

392
00:14:04,640 --> 00:14:06,410
Matsumoto-san said "take it"...

393
00:14:06,410 --> 00:14:08,080
Matsumoto-san said "take it"...

394
00:14:07,170 --> 00:14:08,390
Oh okay... Thank you.

395
00:14:08,740 --> 00:14:09,180
He really is like the Buddha himself

396
00:14:09,180 --> 00:14:11,180
He really is like the Buddha himself

397
00:14:12,850 --> 00:14:17,190
1 hour 50 minutes since the start

398
00:14:12,850 --> 00:14:17,190
9:50 AM

399
00:14:16,500 --> 00:14:18,700
So we're sacrificing the person sitting here to them?

400
00:14:18,760 --> 00:14:19,640
No no.

401
00:14:19,140 --> 00:14:20,410
No no.

402
00:14:19,810 --> 00:14:21,670
No, so we will run away.

403
00:14:20,670 --> 00:14:24,240
Oh okay, I get it. So one of you will get caught.

404
00:14:24,420 --> 00:14:24,980
That's...

405
00:14:27,470 --> 00:14:29,230
Why the hell did you move?!

406
00:14:28,630 --> 00:14:31,800
Headbutt

407
00:14:29,120 --> 00:14:30,000
Move, move, move...

408
00:14:35,730 --> 00:14:37,760
Oh come on!!

409
00:14:38,580 --> 00:14:39,290
He's been targeted!

410
00:14:38,680 --> 00:14:40,050
Oh shit this is bad!

411
00:14:41,680 --> 00:14:43,860
Oh damn, he got separated from the pack.

412
00:15:03,920 --> 00:15:04,510
Are you okay?

413
00:15:06,870 --> 00:15:07,430
Hamada-san...

414
00:15:07,610 --> 00:15:08,210
Hamada-san...

415
00:15:08,670 --> 00:15:09,150
Hamada-san...

416
00:15:11,120 --> 00:15:12,330
You fuckers left me and ran...

417
00:15:12,330 --> 00:15:13,230
You fuckers left me and ran...

418
00:15:15,010 --> 00:15:15,960
You left me and ran...

419
00:15:18,210 --> 00:15:19,220
I heard a proper sound when he headbutted me...

420
00:15:20,460 --> 00:15:21,040
Hey man...

421
00:15:22,210 --> 00:15:22,600
Yeah...

422
00:15:22,330 --> 00:15:24,030
Why did you run?

423
00:15:23,880 --> 00:15:25,350
You were meant to stay there...

424
00:15:24,460 --> 00:15:26,550
We couldn't see if our experiment would work!

425
00:15:26,980 --> 00:15:27,850
Yeah...

426
00:15:30,360 --> 00:15:32,590
Come on Hosei-san, let's do as agreed...

427
00:15:32,940 --> 00:15:33,800
Wait...

428
00:15:33,950 --> 00:15:34,730
What?

429
00:15:36,200 --> 00:15:37,670
It's not that easy to do...

430
00:15:37,570 --> 00:15:38,560
"Our experiment"...

431
00:15:39,370 --> 00:15:40,130
Hamada-san, are you okay?

432
00:15:40,130 --> 00:15:42,140
I'm so sorry, Hamada-san...

433
00:15:44,730 --> 00:15:46,520
Let's go with teamwork, guys...

434
00:15:47,700 --> 00:15:50,340
No, don't give me that, I saw you guys running as a pack and leaving me behind...

435
00:15:52,530 --> 00:15:53,220
I'm sorry...

436
00:15:54,390 --> 00:15:58,720
10 AM

437
00:15:54,390 --> 00:15:58,720
2 hours since the start

438
00:15:56,210 --> 00:15:58,240
You get shocked first as they come out

439
00:15:58,720 --> 00:16:00,360
And then you react and you get shocked again

440
00:16:01,510 --> 00:16:04,960
And then it hits you properly... I mean how many shocks do I have to have every time?

441
00:16:05,950 --> 00:16:06,830
You'll definitely get nightmares...

442
00:16:06,830 --> 00:16:07,850
You definitely would...

443
00:16:08,950 --> 00:16:10,180
I just see their heads...

444
00:16:11,290 --> 00:16:12,260
Just the head?

445
00:16:12,460 --> 00:16:13,190
Yeah

446
00:16:12,620 --> 00:16:13,060
The head itself

447
00:16:35,190 --> 00:16:38,360
Figure 4 leg-lock

448
00:16:40,810 --> 00:16:42,100
Wait, why?!

449
00:16:42,740 --> 00:16:43,240
Why me!?

450
00:16:46,310 --> 00:16:47,380
You can't drift away from the pack

451
00:16:49,660 --> 00:16:51,510
Wait for me, wait for me

452
00:16:54,610 --> 00:16:56,030
This one's a bad one...

453
00:16:55,930 --> 00:16:57,550
Come on guys, wait for me.

454
00:17:02,480 --> 00:17:03,960
Which way are you going?

455
00:17:05,420 --> 00:17:06,270
Ready, set...

456
00:17:07,920 --> 00:17:09,040
Hold on a minute...

457
00:17:09,400 --> 00:17:10,270
HAMADA-SAN!

458
00:17:11,860 --> 00:17:12,660
HAMADA-SAN!

459
00:17:40,950 --> 00:17:42,240
No, when I tried to run away...

460
00:17:42,900 --> 00:17:44,060
Hamada-san blocked my path!

461
00:17:44,060 --> 00:17:46,060
Hamada-san blocked my path!

462
00:17:45,860 --> 00:17:46,260
No way.

463
00:17:46,270 --> 00:17:47,060
You blocked me, didn't you..?

464
00:17:47,950 --> 00:17:48,530
Really?

465
00:17:52,110 --> 00:17:57,840
Dirty Hamada blocks Tanaka's way...

466
00:17:59,310 --> 00:18:01,350
Is there really no way to escape this?

467
00:18:04,180 --> 00:18:05,720
With the next one, shall I hide in the middle?

468
00:18:05,720 --> 00:18:06,890
With the next one, shall I hide in the middle?

469
00:18:06,890 --> 00:18:08,890
With the next one, shall I hide in the middle?

470
00:18:07,490 --> 00:18:08,580
Yes please...

471
00:18:08,080 --> 00:18:09,080
Will you?

472
00:18:10,040 --> 00:18:11,680
And if that works, let's keep rotating

473
00:18:11,680 --> 00:18:12,340
And if that works, let's keep rotating

474
00:18:12,340 --> 00:18:13,660
Yeah, let's keep rotating.

475
00:18:14,210 --> 00:18:14,670
Yeah...

476
00:18:16,950 --> 00:18:19,040
So we will run as fast as possible.

477
00:18:19,510 --> 00:18:20,130
Distract him...

478
00:18:20,130 --> 00:18:20,930
Yes, we will be the distraction

479
00:18:40,680 --> 00:18:43,630
Wait, hold on, I'm going first? Isn't that a bit strange?

480
00:18:43,710 --> 00:18:44,830
What's wrong all of a sudden?

481
00:18:45,410 --> 00:18:46,470
Um... why?

482
00:18:46,260 --> 00:18:48,130
What's up, all of a sudden?

483
00:18:47,050 --> 00:18:50,510
Well, after thinking about it, at the beginning we told Yamasaki to do it...

484
00:18:51,910 --> 00:18:53,170
So shouldn't he have to do it first?

485
00:18:54,060 --> 00:18:54,750
In the name of teamwork...

486
00:18:55,190 --> 00:18:56,650
Okay then, let's do that...

487
00:18:56,720 --> 00:18:58,480
It was decided on Hosei-san

488
00:18:57,450 --> 00:18:59,650
You chickened out before: that's what went wrong

489
00:19:00,350 --> 00:19:01,800
We haven't tried it once yet.

490
00:19:02,050 --> 00:19:05,140
So when you say hide, like when you hear the noise and

491
00:19:04,020 --> 00:19:04,940
Do you want to practice once?

492
00:19:06,040 --> 00:19:06,400
go like this...

493
00:19:06,400 --> 00:19:07,570
Well yeah, that's good

494
00:19:06,930 --> 00:19:08,110
That's great

495
00:19:07,590 --> 00:19:08,290
That's great

496
00:19:08,830 --> 00:19:10,090
You're totally in their blind spot

497
00:19:12,450 --> 00:19:13,600
And we will act as the distraction

498
00:19:14,620 --> 00:19:17,510
Yeah, I was thinking, "We said Yamasaki would do it first so why the hell should I have to do it?"

499
00:19:17,640 --> 00:19:18,250
I understand...

500
00:19:19,040 --> 00:19:21,150
If worst comes to worst and you get captured, it's for everyone's sake.

501
00:19:21,150 --> 00:19:22,830
If worst comes to worst and you get captured, it's for everyone's sake.

502
00:19:22,830 --> 00:19:23,760
If worst comes to worst and you get captured, it's for everyone's sake.

503
00:19:24,060 --> 00:19:25,040
For everyone's sake...

504
00:19:26,800 --> 00:19:27,380
I understand.

505
00:19:27,550 --> 00:19:29,600
We're counting on you, this next one, seriously

506
00:19:29,900 --> 00:19:31,530
You always say that, but then you just run away again...

507
00:19:31,330 --> 00:19:32,190
I promise I won't this time...

508
00:19:32,470 --> 00:19:33,070
If I run away this time, I will feel the shame I brought upon myself

509
00:19:33,070 --> 00:19:33,480
If I run away this time, I will feel the shame I brought upon myself

510
00:19:33,480 --> 00:19:34,010
If I run away this time, I will feel the shame I brought upon myself

511
00:19:34,010 --> 00:19:34,940
If I run away this time, I will feel the shame I brought upon myself

512
00:19:34,940 --> 00:19:36,410
If I run away this time, I will feel the shame I brought upon myself

513
00:19:36,410 --> 00:19:38,410
But then that's it, right?

514
00:19:38,090 --> 00:19:40,010
You're kind of used to that already, no?

515
00:19:41,330 --> 00:19:42,600
But you know, I said Yamasaki had to do it, but if Yamasaki says Tanaka has to do it, then Tanaka has to do it

516
00:19:42,600 --> 00:19:45,810
But you know, I said Yamasaki had to do it, but if Yamasaki says Tanaka has to do it, then Tanaka has to do it

517
00:19:45,810 --> 00:19:48,410
But you know, I said Yamasaki has to do it, but if Yamasaki says Tanaka has to do it, then Tanaka has to do it

518
00:19:48,200 --> 00:19:48,990
Then Tanaka, you do it.

519
00:19:49,620 --> 00:19:50,550
No no, my body is too large and all...

520
00:19:50,550 --> 00:19:51,910
No no, my body is too large and all...

521
00:19:51,910 --> 00:19:52,580
No no, my body is too large and all...

522
00:19:53,210 --> 00:19:55,690
It's either Yamasaki or Tanaka. Do rock-paper-scissors.

523
00:19:56,330 --> 00:19:57,890
Wait, how has this happened?

524
00:19:57,890 --> 00:19:59,150
Wait, how has this happened?

525
00:19:58,940 --> 00:19:59,940
No, I'm not backing down here

526
00:19:59,940 --> 00:20:00,660
No, I'm not backing down here

527
00:20:00,660 --> 00:20:01,360
No, I'm not backing down here

528
00:20:01,870 --> 00:20:02,800
Whoa whoa whoa...

529
00:20:03,980 --> 00:20:04,820
This isn't right...

530
00:20:05,550 --> 00:20:06,270
Hurry up and do it...

531
00:20:07,240 --> 00:20:07,970
On the count of 3

532
00:20:08,410 --> 00:20:09,410
1 match

533
00:20:22,090 --> 00:20:27,760
"Hide from the oni using the Kotatsu plan":

534
00:20:22,090 --> 00:20:27,760
Tanaka will try first!

535
00:20:22,110 --> 00:20:22,760
We're counting on you.

536
00:20:23,030 --> 00:20:23,490
We're counting on you.

537
00:20:23,740 --> 00:20:25,080
Okay, okay...

538
00:20:25,870 --> 00:20:27,500
Shall we try it once then?

539
00:20:27,500 --> 00:20:28,220
Shall we try it once then?

540
00:20:28,550 --> 00:20:29,090
and even if it doesn't...

541
00:20:33,300 --> 00:20:38,310
Sharpshooter (wrestling move)

542
00:21:02,780 --> 00:21:03,670
What was it?

543
00:21:03,670 --> 00:21:04,670
Sharpshooter...

544
00:21:07,200 --> 00:21:09,810
Tanaka celebration!

545
00:21:33,500 --> 00:21:34,210
Amazing

546
00:21:35,420 --> 00:21:36,390
So that's how onis are...

547
00:21:37,070 --> 00:21:37,700
That hurt so much...

548
00:21:38,370 --> 00:21:39,490
But, thanks to you, I was saved

549
00:21:39,490 --> 00:21:40,560
But, thanks to you, I was saved

550
00:21:40,560 --> 00:21:41,920
But, thanks to you, I was saved

551
00:21:43,100 --> 00:21:43,750
We found an escape route...

552
00:21:45,210 --> 00:21:45,890
We found a way?

553
00:21:48,430 --> 00:21:49,420
It's so nice...

554
00:21:49,810 --> 00:21:50,190
Next up...

555
00:21:50,290 --> 00:21:51,150
It was so nice

556
00:21:51,550 --> 00:21:53,550
Next up is Hamada-san, right?

557
00:21:54,420 --> 00:21:55,470
Have a break

558
00:21:56,230 --> 00:21:58,720
You'll be fine, if that was fine, you will definitely be fine.

559
00:21:59,150 --> 00:22:01,570
Do you not think it's a bit of a stupid way of thinking?

560
00:22:02,030 --> 00:22:02,520
What?

561
00:22:02,330 --> 00:22:04,650
No, they clearly just don't look here...

562
00:22:04,670 --> 00:22:07,570
Yeah, I mean I ran around this area and he didn't notice you at all...

563
00:22:08,950 --> 00:22:10,270
So please rest up this time, Hamada-san...

564
00:22:10,810 --> 00:22:12,840
Oh man, I should've gone first...

565
00:22:19,640 --> 00:22:23,820
Futon beater

566
00:22:30,160 --> 00:22:31,860
Tanaka's voice...

567
00:22:35,780 --> 00:22:36,370
Hamada-san...

568
00:22:41,240 --> 00:22:42,460
You did it.

569
00:22:42,930 --> 00:22:43,670
This really does

570
00:22:43,780 --> 00:22:44,420
work well, eh?

571
00:22:44,420 --> 00:22:45,350
It really does

572
00:23:01,990 --> 00:23:06,260
Thai Kick

573
00:23:08,430 --> 00:23:09,680
Oh man, he's found you...

574
00:23:10,570 --> 00:23:11,500
He's found you...

575
00:23:12,010 --> 00:23:13,200
Oh man, this is the worst!

576
00:23:14,100 --> 00:23:16,250
Wait, wait, oh shit! It's a Thai Kick!

577
00:23:16,740 --> 00:23:19,260
Wait, wow, no no, please!

578
00:23:19,750 --> 00:23:20,870
It's the worst punishment too...

579
00:23:20,610 --> 00:23:22,050
Hey, ouch, ouch!

580
00:23:29,100 --> 00:23:30,600
That was unprecedented...

581
00:23:31,730 --> 00:23:32,430
Zaki-san...

582
00:23:32,700 --> 00:23:33,720
Wait, what happened?

583
00:23:33,960 --> 00:23:36,000
So the Oni  found you

584
00:23:36,000 --> 00:23:39,000
he saw you

585
00:23:36,590 --> 00:23:37,460
When he came about here

586
00:23:42,330 --> 00:23:45,270
20 hours remaining

587
00:23:42,330 --> 00:23:45,270
Noon

588
00:23:56,380 --> 00:23:59,150
His boobs are moving everywhere, that's disgusting

589
00:23:56,480 --> 00:23:58,130
Come, gather around these boobs!

590
00:23:59,280 --> 00:24:00,190
I still can't tell the difference...

591
00:24:00,190 --> 00:24:01,160
I know...

592
00:24:00,690 --> 00:24:02,180
Yeah...

593
00:24:01,130 --> 00:24:02,560
Even though we were just talking about it...

594
00:24:04,240 --> 00:24:05,140
I've brought you lunch

595
00:24:06,200 --> 00:24:06,870
Yes...

596
00:24:07,550 --> 00:24:10,100
The reason that scum like you

597
00:24:10,830 --> 00:24:13,020
can eat like normal people

598
00:24:13,020 --> 00:24:13,930
can eat like normal people

599
00:24:15,410 --> 00:24:16,890
is truly down to Matsumoto-san.

600
00:24:19,900 --> 00:24:20,370
So work hard from here on in as well, to ensure you don't become dead weight to Matsumoto-san

601
00:24:20,370 --> 00:24:20,900
So work hard from here on in as well, to ensure you don't become dead weight to Matsumoto-san

602
00:24:20,900 --> 00:24:22,670
So work hard from here on in as well, to ensure you don't become dead weight to Matsumoto-san

603
00:24:22,670 --> 00:24:24,770
So work hard from here on in as well, to ensure you don't become dead weight to Matsumoto-san

604
00:24:27,690 --> 00:24:32,190
Right then, shall we say how grateful we are to Matsumoto-san again and then eat?

605
00:24:35,340 --> 00:24:36,800
Even for the likes of us,

606
00:24:37,530 --> 00:24:39,110
Even for the likes of us...

607
00:24:39,650 --> 00:24:41,560
Hamada... altogether

608
00:24:41,560 --> 00:24:42,720
Hamada... altogether

609
00:24:43,480 --> 00:24:43,990
Right, ready?

610
00:24:44,550 --> 00:24:46,060
Even for the likes of us...

611
00:24:46,720 --> 00:24:48,350
Even for the likes of us...

612
00:24:50,210 --> 00:24:51,730
you have given food.

613
00:24:52,850 --> 00:24:55,010
you have given food.

614
00:24:55,650 --> 00:24:56,510
Matsumoto-san,

615
00:24:56,960 --> 00:24:58,330
Matsumoto-san...

616
00:24:59,110 --> 00:24:59,740
from the bottom of my heart,

617
00:25:01,540 --> 00:25:02,530
from the bottom of my heart...

618
00:25:03,090 --> 00:25:04,080
Thank you.

619
00:25:05,510 --> 00:25:06,960
Thank you...

620
00:25:07,430 --> 00:25:07,910
Right then...

621
00:25:20,600 --> 00:25:24,900
Lunch Time

622
00:25:21,080 --> 00:25:22,430
4 hours from the start

623
00:25:22,660 --> 00:25:24,560
The 4 cannot hide their fatigue

624
00:25:25,080 --> 00:25:27,720
All they can do is eat their curry...

625
00:25:32,540 --> 00:25:37,880
The 4 get scared at the smallest of sounds...

626
00:25:35,630 --> 00:25:37,650
Anyone would be like this

627
00:25:36,910 --> 00:25:37,900
Yeah, it was like this the whole time

628
00:25:38,330 --> 00:25:39,330
You guys

629
00:25:38,370 --> 00:25:39,630
So annoying...

630
00:25:39,670 --> 00:25:40,950
That was so annoying...

631
00:25:41,000 --> 00:25:43,680
You were so scared of Fujiwara's "Pon-pon" as well...

632
00:25:43,280 --> 00:25:44,320
That's what happens!

633
00:25:44,230 --> 00:25:46,070
Learn the difference!

634
00:25:46,510 --> 00:25:47,220
Between the sounds, right?

635
00:25:48,190 --> 00:25:50,010
When someone moves, you move...

636
00:25:55,400 --> 00:26:01,570
Picture Story-show

637
00:25:59,130 --> 00:26:00,240
What the hell...

638
00:26:00,240 --> 00:26:01,080
What is it?

639
00:26:15,700 --> 00:26:17,040
I was so tired...

640
00:26:21,710 --> 00:26:22,460
Where are you going?

641
00:26:22,160 --> 00:26:23,420
Where is he taking you?

642
00:26:26,530 --> 00:26:30,830
A picture storyteller arrives!

643
00:26:26,890 --> 00:26:27,560
Something's coming...

644
00:26:29,030 --> 00:26:30,980
Everything's black, that's what makes it creepy...

645
00:26:32,510 --> 00:26:34,170
Yeah, everything is black...

646
00:26:36,340 --> 00:26:38,890
Once upon a time...

647
00:26:39,340 --> 00:26:42,060
There was an old man and an old woman

648
00:26:40,440 --> 00:26:47,120
Momotaro

649
00:26:42,840 --> 00:26:46,200
One day, the old man went to the mountains

650
00:26:46,450 --> 00:26:49,140
and the old woman went to the river to wash laundry

651
00:26:49,710 --> 00:26:53,360
The woman was washing her clothes

652
00:26:54,090 --> 00:26:56,310
when suddenly, a peach

653
00:26:56,680 --> 00:26:57,960
There's absolutely nothing drawn...

654
00:26:58,620 --> 00:26:59,700
came floating down

655
00:27:01,650 --> 00:27:04,960
The old woman got her axe...

656
00:27:04,280 --> 00:27:05,340
He gets angry unless you watch properly...

657
00:27:05,440 --> 00:27:08,640
4 minutes later

658
00:27:08,140 --> 00:27:10,370
and they lived happily ever after...

659
00:27:11,610 --> 00:27:12,870
The End...

660
00:27:23,530 --> 00:27:24,340
Absolutely no point...

661
00:27:25,880 --> 00:27:27,250
He just stole some of your stamina...

662
00:27:25,940 --> 00:27:26,450
Are you okay?

663
00:27:29,790 --> 00:27:30,760
That's so true...

664
00:27:32,440 --> 00:27:33,010
Did you see?

665
00:27:33,520 --> 00:27:35,480
Yes, we stayed around...

666
00:27:35,990 --> 00:27:36,710
That was awful..

667
00:27:39,770 --> 00:27:40,170
Everything was just black

668
00:27:40,170 --> 00:27:41,940
Everything was just black

669
00:27:42,340 --> 00:27:46,680
1 PM

670
00:27:42,340 --> 00:27:46,680
19 hours remaining

671
00:27:43,050 --> 00:27:45,390
If this bends, then I'll believe in it...

672
00:27:45,510 --> 00:27:46,100
Yeah, you would...

673
00:27:46,580 --> 00:27:47,340
I mean if that happened

674
00:27:46,590 --> 00:27:47,340
You would have to

675
00:27:47,910 --> 00:27:48,510
Yeah, true.

676
00:27:48,580 --> 00:27:49,850
I would definitely believe it

677
00:27:48,580 --> 00:27:49,850
I would too...

678
00:27:50,210 --> 00:27:52,610
But why is it a spoon? Can you bend forks?

679
00:27:52,080 --> 00:27:58,420
Out of boredom,

680
00:27:52,080 --> 00:27:58,420
the 4 start to try bending spoons

681
00:27:56,030 --> 00:27:57,110
Do you bend forks?

682
00:27:57,760 --> 00:27:59,390
I've never seen that happen

683
00:28:08,930 --> 00:28:12,100
Candle burn

684
00:28:13,330 --> 00:28:14,000
Holy shit, he's fast

685
00:28:14,000 --> 00:28:15,250
He's so fast!

686
00:28:32,160 --> 00:28:35,330
Picture Story-show

687
00:28:33,160 --> 00:28:34,220
Here he comes again...

688
00:28:40,630 --> 00:28:42,310
He saw him walking very slowly...

689
00:28:41,670 --> 00:28:43,110
What story even is this?

690
00:28:42,000 --> 00:28:47,270
The tortoise and the hare

691
00:28:42,710 --> 00:28:44,350
and the hare laughed

692
00:28:45,030 --> 00:28:47,630
at the tortoise

693
00:28:45,970 --> 00:28:47,040
Oh, the tortoise and the hare

694
00:28:46,610 --> 00:28:47,520
Yes.

695
00:28:55,550 --> 00:28:59,820
3 minutes later

696
00:28:56,490 --> 00:28:58,600
He had to watch the whole time!

697
00:28:59,050 --> 00:28:59,950
It's all black...

698
00:29:00,370 --> 00:29:02,480
I'm off ahead then!

699
00:29:00,430 --> 00:29:01,340
He has to watch it all.

700
00:29:04,000 --> 00:29:06,550
...happily ever after...

701
00:29:06,380 --> 00:29:07,460
Nothing he could do

702
00:29:07,670 --> 00:29:09,280
The End

703
00:29:11,100 --> 00:29:15,130
Headbutt

704
00:29:12,270 --> 00:29:13,690
That would be scary

705
00:29:13,960 --> 00:29:15,600
Wait, wait, this isn't right!

706
00:29:22,030 --> 00:29:22,880
Oh damn!

707
00:29:41,840 --> 00:29:43,180
When the "Headbutt" thing came up,

708
00:29:43,880 --> 00:29:45,150
he was like "Wah!"

709
00:29:47,130 --> 00:29:49,170
I did not expect a headbutt to come out of that...

710
00:29:52,710 --> 00:29:57,010
3 PM

711
00:29:52,710 --> 00:29:57,010
Remaining 17 hours

712
00:29:53,910 --> 00:29:54,240
I wonder if there are no snacks...

713
00:29:54,240 --> 00:29:55,510
I wonder if there are no snacks...

714
00:29:56,010 --> 00:29:56,690
I want a snack...

715
00:29:57,610 --> 00:29:58,590
I want to eat some snacks too...

716
00:29:58,370 --> 00:30:00,470
I'm tired so something sweet...

717
00:29:59,850 --> 00:30:01,120
Yes, something sweet.

718
00:30:01,100 --> 00:30:01,940
I want to too.

719
00:30:05,250 --> 00:30:08,420
Pie

720
00:30:09,020 --> 00:30:11,760
Gaki no Tsukai Producer

721
00:30:09,020 --> 00:30:11,760
The World's Heipo

722
00:30:14,140 --> 00:30:15,150
What's with this guy? Oh it's Heipo!

723
00:30:15,150 --> 00:30:15,940
What's with this guy? Oh it's Heipo!

724
00:30:15,970 --> 00:30:17,430
He's trying to attack us?

725
00:30:17,660 --> 00:30:18,380
For real?

726
00:30:18,730 --> 00:30:19,570
We can beat this guy!

727
00:30:19,180 --> 00:30:20,270
No no no no...

728
00:30:20,960 --> 00:30:21,500
We can win!

729
00:30:21,400 --> 00:30:21,880
Ow...

730
00:30:22,300 --> 00:30:22,960
Ow, that hurts...

731
00:30:23,140 --> 00:30:23,840
What the hell do you think you're doing!?

732
00:30:26,500 --> 00:30:27,930
Go home!

733
00:30:28,760 --> 00:30:29,760
You're the worst!

734
00:30:30,280 --> 00:30:31,300
He failed so miserably...

735
00:30:31,300 --> 00:30:33,020
As he shot up, he dropped the whole plate...

736
00:30:36,570 --> 00:30:37,580
That was Saito-san, right?

737
00:30:37,510 --> 00:30:38,000
Awful

738
00:30:38,350 --> 00:30:38,870
So awful

739
00:30:39,610 --> 00:30:40,710
He is an awful person

740
00:30:41,460 --> 00:30:42,060
He's trying to kill this project

741
00:30:42,060 --> 00:30:44,060
He's trying to kill this project

742
00:30:43,830 --> 00:30:45,960
Even when we're working our asses off running away...

743
00:30:47,730 --> 00:30:50,050
When we see him next time, we'll be able to tell from his feet.

744
00:30:49,430 --> 00:30:50,080
Right at the beginning

745
00:30:50,360 --> 00:30:51,180
Yeah, he ran all over the pie...

746
00:30:50,670 --> 00:30:52,960
When he shot up, he dropped it all...

747
00:31:10,480 --> 00:31:12,140
What the hell, guys?

748
00:31:11,870 --> 00:31:13,180
You reacted first...

749
00:31:13,810 --> 00:31:15,430
Come, gather around these boobs

750
00:31:15,640 --> 00:31:16,080
Oh!

751
00:31:17,690 --> 00:31:19,230
I mean, if you do it for 6 hours,

752
00:31:19,890 --> 00:31:20,750
that's how one would react...

753
00:31:21,620 --> 00:31:22,690
Oh awesome, snacks!

754
00:31:23,050 --> 00:31:23,690
Cookies, huh?

755
00:31:24,590 --> 00:31:25,340
Guys, it's 3 o'clock.

756
00:31:26,940 --> 00:31:27,370
Hamada

757
00:31:27,520 --> 00:31:27,840
Yes

758
00:31:28,210 --> 00:31:29,130
What do we think of when we say 3 o'clock?

759
00:31:30,130 --> 00:31:30,680
Snacking...

760
00:31:31,330 --> 00:31:32,500
Don't say stupid things!

761
00:31:33,760 --> 00:31:34,170
Sorry

762
00:31:34,710 --> 00:31:36,880
I brought you some snacks, as it's 3 o'clock

763
00:31:36,160 --> 00:31:36,920
What the hell...

764
00:31:36,650 --> 00:31:37,710
So it's fine...

765
00:31:38,700 --> 00:31:39,430
And on top of that

766
00:31:39,010 --> 00:31:40,160
Yeah, we don't need the remarks...

767
00:31:40,330 --> 00:31:41,610
I brought you a game to play too.

768
00:31:43,550 --> 00:31:44,220
Whilst you live out your pathetic lives, you should play the Game of Life

769
00:31:44,220 --> 00:31:45,350
Whilst you live out your pathetic lives, you should play the Game of Life

770
00:31:45,350 --> 00:31:47,260
Whilst you live out your pathetic lives, you should play the Game of Life

771
00:31:47,260 --> 00:31:48,720
Whilst you live out your pathetic lives, you should play the Game of Life

772
00:31:50,500 --> 00:31:50,940
You got 20!

773
00:31:50,780 --> 00:31:51,650
You got 20!

774
00:31:53,360 --> 00:31:59,670
The 4 get so

775
00:31:53,360 --> 00:31:59,670

776
00:31:53,700 --> 00:31:54,750
You get $250,000!

00:31:55,770 --> 00:31:56,280
Here we go

778
00:31:56,150 --> 00:31:56,590

779
00:32:01,370 --> 00:32:05,710

This guy is amazing...

785
00:32:24,670 --> 00:32:25,690
God, he pisses me off

786
00:32:25,690 --> 00:32:27,570
He's not developed at all...

787
00:32:28,830 --> 00:32:29,460
Go home!

788
00:32:34,140 --> 00:32:34,990
What the hell is this about?

789
00:32:37,380 --> 00:32:38,530
He's the worst...

790
00:32:41,250 --> 00:32:41,850
Go home!

791
00:32:42,850 --> 00:32:43,870
Seriously, go home!

Oh, a boy.

796
00:32:45,840 --> 00:32:46,580
A boy is born

797
00:32:47,010 --> 00:32:50,230
Therefore, receive 5,000 yen... sorry, 1,000 yen from each player

798
00:32:50,270 --> 00:32:50,770
There you go...

799
00:32:50,940 --> 00:32:52,500
You got a baby boy...

800
00:32:55,820 --> 00:32:56,420
Okay, here...

801
00:33:02,130 --> 00:33:03,050
What the hell

802
00:33:02,820 --> 00:33:03,740
Na na na na...

803
00:33:04,190 --> 00:33:05,220
Man, that scared me!

804
00:33:05,420 --> 00:33:06,710
That thing is so scary...

805
00:33:07,230 --> 00:33:08,710
It really is...

806
00:33:08,710 --> 00:33:09,490
How is it?

807
00:33:13,690 --> 00:33:15,970
We're really sensitive to sounds right now, man...

808
00:33:16,260 --> 00:33:17,550
Seriously, the slightest of sounds scares

809
00:33:17,770 --> 00:33:18,990
Just come through the door normally...

810
00:33:18,120 --> 00:33:19,300
the crap out of us...

811
00:33:19,440 --> 00:33:20,370
And how is everything?

812
00:33:24,030 --> 00:33:25,490
We were playing that just now...

813
00:33:25,710 --> 00:33:26,850
Oh, I thought I would confiscate it...

814
00:33:27,250 --> 00:33:28,100
Why?

815
00:33:27,350 --> 00:33:29,030
He just got a baby boy...

816
00:33:28,430 --> 00:33:31,770
Well because I was watching and you looked like you were having fun

817
00:33:31,430 --> 00:33:33,090
"looked like we were having fun"...

818
00:33:32,670 --> 00:33:34,410
so I thought, "Well, I'm not having that..."

819
00:33:34,530 --> 00:33:35,000
Aww man, I just became a professional athlete...

820
00:33:35,000 --> 00:33:37,000
Aww man, I just became a professional athlete...

821
00:33:38,170 --> 00:33:39,410
Well alright then, everyone get naked.

822
00:33:39,710 --> 00:33:40,870
Why the hell?

823
00:33:41,270 --> 00:33:43,220
Why? Get naked and do what?

824
00:33:45,380 --> 00:33:46,110
Wow, you're being kind of rude to me, huh?

825
00:33:46,110 --> 00:33:48,150
Wow, you're being kind of rude to me, huh?

826
00:33:48,820 --> 00:33:50,310
It's annoying me a bit...

827
00:33:51,980 --> 00:33:53,380
I may be coming back later...

828
00:33:53,380 --> 00:33:54,220
I may be coming back later...

829
00:33:55,220 --> 00:33:56,260
No, you don't need to.

830
00:33:55,790 --> 00:33:57,100
The next time I come,

831
00:33:58,110 --> 00:34:00,200
I won't be anywhere near as nice as I am being now

832
00:34:01,190 --> 00:34:02,110
I just came to tell you lot that...

833
00:34:02,340 --> 00:34:04,000
Please give us a break...

834
00:34:03,720 --> 00:34:05,570
I'm going to kill you all, starting with the tallest...

835
00:34:07,550 --> 00:34:09,250
However you look at it, that's me...

836
00:34:09,520 --> 00:34:10,750
However you look at it...

837
00:34:10,150 --> 00:34:10,930
I mean kill... Really?

838
00:34:12,390 --> 00:34:13,070
You got it?

839
00:34:13,940 --> 00:34:14,830
But in all seriousness, please give that back

840
00:34:14,860 --> 00:34:16,830
Yeah, please give that back

841
00:34:15,470 --> 00:34:17,120
Just this even

842
00:34:17,570 --> 00:34:18,320
No way.

843
00:34:18,420 --> 00:34:19,520
That's my oxygen can...

844
00:34:18,960 --> 00:34:20,460
At least the oxygen cans...

845
00:34:20,480 --> 00:34:21,620
Who the hell do you think you're speaking to?

846
00:34:22,730 --> 00:34:24,150
Tanaka, just take it from him.

847
00:34:24,160 --> 00:34:25,760
Just who the hell do you think you're speaking to?

848
00:34:25,760 --> 00:34:26,390
Just who the hell do you think you're speaking to?

849
00:34:28,530 --> 00:34:29,690
Tanaka, just take it from him...

850
00:34:31,340 --> 00:34:31,990
Take it, Tanaka!

851
00:34:31,510 --> 00:34:32,530
Please give this back to us...

852
00:34:33,780 --> 00:34:36,460
No, don't, my back is hurting at the moment

853
00:34:34,620 --> 00:34:35,650
Just leave our stuff alone

854
00:34:36,950 --> 00:34:38,490
Seriously, my back is really bad at the moment

855
00:34:39,180 --> 00:34:40,160
Stop that, you fool!

856
00:34:45,230 --> 00:34:45,900
What's he up to now..?

857
00:34:47,500 --> 00:34:48,050
Hey hey hey!

858
00:34:48,020 --> 00:34:49,160
Wow wow, wait!

859
00:34:49,410 --> 00:34:50,640
Come on, man!

860
00:34:50,660 --> 00:34:51,180
Hey man!

861
00:34:51,120 --> 00:34:52,120
Hey!

862
00:34:52,860 --> 00:34:53,570
DIE!

863
00:34:57,290 --> 00:34:58,470
He just said his back was hurting...

864
00:35:04,040 --> 00:35:04,970
I'll be coming back!

865
00:35:05,780 --> 00:35:08,410
No it's fine... Please don't come back

866
00:35:10,030 --> 00:35:12,220
Oh man, he's ridiculous

867
00:35:10,080 --> 00:35:11,750
He really goes too far...

868
00:35:18,370 --> 00:35:20,710
Look at what he's done...

869
00:35:20,590 --> 00:35:22,710
God this is horrible...

870
00:35:23,740 --> 00:35:24,570
He's so pathetic, huh?

871
00:35:24,640 --> 00:35:25,320
Yeah...

872
00:35:25,730 --> 00:35:28,030
We got to get all the pieces for the game...

873
00:35:25,930 --> 00:35:27,100
Yeah we do...

874
00:35:29,010 --> 00:35:29,900
Yeah, we're going to need to find them

875
00:35:29,640 --> 00:35:30,490
Yeah...

876
00:35:30,910 --> 00:35:32,650
Oh man, the tea as well...

877
00:35:34,960 --> 00:35:39,260
15 hours 10 minutes remaining

878
00:35:34,960 --> 00:35:39,260
4:50 PM

879
00:35:38,640 --> 00:35:39,560
By the way, why,

880
00:35:40,860 --> 00:35:44,000
when you hear the sound, do you  instinctively go "Wah!"?

881
00:35:44,000 --> 00:35:46,000
when you hear the sound, do you instinctively go "Wah!"?

882
00:35:46,120 --> 00:35:46,760
Do I?

883
00:35:47,200 --> 00:35:49,700
Yeah when you hear the sound, you always shout "Wah!"

884
00:35:51,450 --> 00:35:53,880
However many times it happens, it scares me...

885
00:35:54,690 --> 00:35:55,560
It really does...

886
00:36:03,420 --> 00:36:06,590
Bum

887
00:36:04,280 --> 00:36:05,050
Wait, why are there two of them?

888
00:36:09,190 --> 00:36:10,160
Wait, hang on a minute!

889
00:36:10,380 --> 00:36:11,290
Hang on a minute!

890
00:36:11,740 --> 00:36:14,520
Wait, wait wait, oh my God I am going to smack you guys so hard!

891
00:36:20,570 --> 00:36:21,380
What did it say?

892
00:36:21,530 --> 00:36:21,990
Bum...

893
00:36:22,090 --> 00:36:22,530
Bum?

894
00:36:22,560 --> 00:36:23,610
Wait, wait, what?

895
00:36:32,550 --> 00:36:33,200
What?

896
00:36:34,210 --> 00:36:35,410
Hey, what are you doing!?

897
00:36:36,810 --> 00:36:38,210
Oh that is just worst form of humiliation...

898
00:36:54,180 --> 00:36:54,920
It was soft...

899
00:36:56,210 --> 00:36:56,770
I see...

900
00:36:56,430 --> 00:36:57,000
The feeling?

901
00:36:57,690 --> 00:36:58,720
But one of them...

902
00:36:59,430 --> 00:37:00,620
his asshole touched my nose...

903
00:37:00,870 --> 00:37:01,490
Seriously?

904
00:37:10,220 --> 00:37:12,550
My shoulder's started to hurt too...

905
00:37:13,470 --> 00:37:14,850
Oh and what happened to your rib?

906
00:37:14,920 --> 00:37:15,390
Oh the ribtotally has a fracture in it

907
00:37:15,390 --> 00:37:16,630
Oh the rib totally has a fracture in it

908
00:37:16,630 --> 00:37:18,630
Oh the rib totally has a fracture in it

909
00:37:18,930 --> 00:37:20,010
Like for sure

910
00:37:20,700 --> 00:37:23,140
But you were fine before...

911
00:37:22,490 --> 00:37:23,140
Yeah...

912
00:37:22,940 --> 00:37:24,220
That's true

913
00:37:23,560 --> 00:37:24,940
You were playing the Game of Life totally fine

914
00:37:24,680 --> 00:37:26,140
You were having the time of your life playing it...

915
00:37:27,540 --> 00:37:30,970
That's because I didn't want to dampen the atmosphere by saying it hurt and stuff

916
00:37:31,700 --> 00:37:32,900
while we're playing a game...

917
00:37:38,680 --> 00:37:41,850
Open palm strike

918
00:37:40,620 --> 00:37:41,340
This is bad!

919
00:37:41,920 --> 00:37:42,610
This is really bad

920
00:38:03,200 --> 00:38:04,200
I'm not getting caug-...

921
00:38:06,310 --> 00:38:11,580
"Helper-man" appears

922
00:38:09,370 --> 00:38:10,040
It's Helper-man!

923
00:38:10,040 --> 00:38:10,600
Helper-man!

924
00:38:10,140 --> 00:38:10,840
Helper-man!

925
00:38:10,700 --> 00:38:11,380
Helper-man!

926
00:38:11,110 --> 00:38:11,810
Helper-man!

927
00:38:13,450 --> 00:38:14,720
Oh, he stopped him!

928
00:38:15,080 --> 00:38:15,730
As expected

929
00:38:16,310 --> 00:38:17,040
Awesome

930
00:38:22,920 --> 00:38:23,760
Great work, Helper-man!

931
00:38:24,090 --> 00:38:24,680
Thank you!

932
00:38:24,680 --> 00:38:25,260
Thank you!

933
00:38:32,440 --> 00:38:35,940
Giant swing

934
00:39:04,220 --> 00:39:05,330
Oh man, this is dangerous!

935
00:39:05,450 --> 00:39:06,370
This is really dangerous!

936
00:39:11,450 --> 00:39:12,240
I'm so tired...

937
00:39:12,580 --> 00:39:13,350
I know...

938
00:39:17,220 --> 00:39:18,710
Damn, that guy is huge!

939
00:39:21,720 --> 00:39:26,060
14 hours 40 minutes left

940
00:39:21,720 --> 00:39:26,060
5:20 PM

941
00:39:31,830 --> 00:39:35,330
Bum

942
00:39:32,050 --> 00:39:34,190
What? Again?!

943
00:39:36,510 --> 00:39:37,320
No, please don't!

944
00:39:39,890 --> 00:39:41,150
Wait, why the hell!?

945
00:39:42,950 --> 00:39:44,130
Wait a minute...

946
00:39:44,820 --> 00:39:45,770
That's a bad one...

947
00:39:46,480 --> 00:39:47,190
Wait wait wait...

948
00:39:51,360 --> 00:39:52,110
Thank God...

949
00:39:55,030 --> 00:39:56,580
You did this before...

950
00:39:56,990 --> 00:39:58,590
This is so bad

951
00:39:57,100 --> 00:39:58,440
You literally just did this before to me!

952
00:39:59,050 --> 00:40:00,200
You did this to me before!

953
00:40:23,450 --> 00:40:24,500
Hamada-san, are you okay?

954
00:40:25,940 --> 00:40:26,370
Hamada-san...

955
00:40:26,370 --> 00:40:26,910
Hamada-san?

956
00:40:27,110 --> 00:40:27,570
Hamada-san?

957
00:40:36,120 --> 00:40:36,990
There he is...

958
00:40:36,940 --> 00:40:37,490
Are you okay?

959
00:40:37,500 --> 00:40:38,000
Are you okay?

960
00:40:38,080 --> 00:40:38,900
Are you?

961
00:40:40,650 --> 00:40:42,170
That last one was something else

962
00:40:42,190 --> 00:40:42,970
That was one amazing ass...

963
00:40:44,400 --> 00:40:45,630
The hairs hurt a bit...

964
00:40:46,610 --> 00:40:48,080
It was a proper black ass...

965
00:40:48,970 --> 00:40:49,530
But on top of that...

966
00:40:50,870 --> 00:40:52,980
His balls were just... the whole time...

967
00:40:55,610 --> 00:40:56,350
rubbing up and down?

968
00:40:57,490 --> 00:40:58,310
His balls?

969
00:41:00,270 --> 00:41:01,520
And the hair was like prickly...

970
00:41:02,120 --> 00:41:02,690
For real?

971
00:41:03,620 --> 00:41:05,320
Like lukewarm...

972
00:41:06,000 --> 00:41:06,920
Just lukewarm, huh?

973
00:41:10,630 --> 00:41:18,270
Batsu Game Headquarters

974
00:41:11,930 --> 00:41:13,930
It's not like I enjoyed doing it!

975
00:41:14,570 --> 00:41:15,470
I don't want to stick my ass on my partner's face!

976
00:41:15,470 --> 00:41:17,470
I don't want to stick my ass on my partner's face!

977
00:41:38,720 --> 00:41:41,560
I don't think the nervousness we felt

978
00:41:42,110 --> 00:41:43,250
is really getting across to you guys.

979
00:41:43,310 --> 00:41:45,840
Like literally if we heard anything, we would be on alert

980
00:41:45,990 --> 00:41:47,750
And that was for the whole time...

981
00:41:47,920 --> 00:41:48,920
You just don't get used to it, right?

982
00:41:48,770 --> 00:41:49,510
The sounds, right?

983
00:41:48,910 --> 00:41:49,830
Yeah...

984
00:41:49,910 --> 00:41:51,930
And Hamada-san properly freaks out

985
00:41:52,070 --> 00:41:53,260
so we get dragged along too...

986
00:41:53,110 --> 00:41:54,990
You were the worst out of all of us, you idiot!

987
00:41:55,060 --> 00:41:56,340
But with me it was just the fact I shouted, right?

988
00:41:57,110 --> 00:41:58,130
No no, when we were in the

989
00:41:58,140 --> 00:41:59,220
No, but that's what's scary...

990
00:41:59,220 --> 00:42:01,200
And when we are all sitting in the kotatsu...

991
00:42:01,510 --> 00:42:02,610
He would be the one guy going

992
00:42:04,780 --> 00:42:05,850
Yeah, he did

993
00:42:05,090 --> 00:42:05,850
He did...

994
00:42:06,690 --> 00:42:07,800
Because I was scared...

995
00:42:08,440 --> 00:42:10,520
When the Oni comes up, the noise is like 'Pshuuuu'

996
00:42:10,990 --> 00:42:12,820
When Fujiwara come out, it's "Pon-pon"

997
00:42:13,310 --> 00:42:14,090
Learn!

998
00:42:14,090 --> 00:42:16,060
No no, seriously that is impossible

999
00:42:15,660 --> 00:42:16,840
Every time it went "pon-pon", you guys were freaking out...

1000
00:42:16,850 --> 00:42:18,080
Honestly, it's impossible.

1001
00:42:18,470 --> 00:42:21,040
14 hours remaining

1002
00:42:18,470 --> 00:42:21,040
6 PM

1003
00:42:21,900 --> 00:42:23,690
10 hours since the start

1004
00:42:24,490 --> 00:42:27,020
Not knowing when the onis could appear

1005
00:42:27,600 --> 00:42:29,170
has stolen their smiles away...

1006
00:42:30,660 --> 00:42:32,240
From about here, conversations just...

1007
00:42:32,490 --> 00:42:33,850
Yeah, from around this point

1008
00:42:33,550 --> 00:42:34,740
Yeah...

1009
00:42:33,900 --> 00:42:35,570
You must just be defeated by this point...

1010
00:42:49,310 --> 00:42:50,170
Just a blank...

1011
00:42:50,740 --> 00:42:51,410
A blank...

1012
00:42:51,920 --> 00:42:52,740
That's so annoying...

1013
00:42:53,100 --> 00:42:54,790
Blanks are not on...

1014
00:43:10,690 --> 00:43:15,020
Ladle

1015
00:43:11,700 --> 00:43:12,890
This is so dirty!

1016
00:43:23,420 --> 00:43:24,930
Are you serious!

1017
00:43:23,930 --> 00:43:24,930
Shit

1018
00:43:34,520 --> 00:43:35,720
That's not fair...

1019
00:43:36,370 --> 00:43:37,310
That's so dirty...

1020
00:43:41,280 --> 00:43:42,640
Oh man, this is so scary

1021
00:43:42,690 --> 00:43:44,520
We don't even know where they could come from..

1022
00:43:54,230 --> 00:44:02,570
Oni sneaking in...

1023
00:44:01,180 --> 00:44:02,420
You did well to notice him though...

1024
00:44:02,730 --> 00:44:04,100
Who noticed him first? Was it Hamada-san?

1025
00:44:03,970 --> 00:44:04,640
Yeah, I was the first one...

1026
00:44:04,510 --> 00:44:05,080
That's right

1027
00:44:06,180 --> 00:44:07,470
And I thought "Please get Endo" so I didn't say...

1028
00:44:06,940 --> 00:44:08,480
Hamada notices the Oni

1029
00:44:07,500 --> 00:44:08,130
Oh yeah

1030
00:44:07,980 --> 00:44:08,830
Oh yeah, he's keeping quiet about it

1031
00:44:08,850 --> 00:44:09,490
Oh yeah

1032
00:44:09,060 --> 00:44:11,140
Why are you keeping quiet about it? Please tell me!

1033
00:44:10,790 --> 00:44:12,590
I didn't care about you

1034
00:44:13,480 --> 00:44:17,150
Open palm strike

1035
00:44:17,020 --> 00:44:18,160
This guy...

1036
00:44:19,750 --> 00:44:20,780
He's a bit too fat...

1037
00:44:20,630 --> 00:44:22,100
He's so slow...

1038
00:44:23,300 --> 00:44:24,460
Like just hopeless...

1039
00:44:25,610 --> 00:44:26,990
He can't run well, can he?

1040
00:44:26,890 --> 00:44:27,950
Yeah, he's hopeless...

1041
00:44:31,150 --> 00:44:32,070
Yeah, he was

1042
00:44:33,610 --> 00:44:35,550
He can't turn well either...

1043
00:44:41,770 --> 00:44:42,730
That was quite funny...

1044
00:44:42,990 --> 00:44:44,010
I can outrun him...

1045
00:44:46,020 --> 00:44:50,320
13 hours 40 minutes remaining

1046
00:44:46,020 --> 00:44:50,320
6:20 PM

1047
00:44:46,300 --> 00:44:48,240
It's probably better if we all look in different directions

1048
00:44:49,780 --> 00:44:50,490
That's true

1049
00:44:50,860 --> 00:44:51,310
Right?

1050
00:44:51,360 --> 00:44:53,310
I will watch over there...

1051
00:44:53,310 --> 00:44:53,950
I will watch over there...

1052
00:44:55,160 --> 00:44:56,280
Then I will watch this area

1053
00:44:55,890 --> 00:45:01,200
The 4 start to watch all directions

1054
00:44:56,900 --> 00:44:57,640
I will watch this area over here

1055
00:44:59,440 --> 00:45:01,330
Then I will watch over here. And you, Yamasaki?

1056
00:45:01,880 --> 00:45:02,880
Where should I watch?

1057
00:45:02,960 --> 00:45:03,760
You should watch over there, surely?

1058
00:45:03,990 --> 00:45:04,570
Over there?

1059
00:45:05,050 --> 00:45:06,650
The area that's not covered by the skull...

1060
00:45:07,260 --> 00:45:09,510
No, just like

1061
00:45:08,670 --> 00:45:09,170
All of it?

1062
00:45:30,960 --> 00:45:32,770
This is so annoying...

1063
00:45:31,630 --> 00:45:32,600
Just... why?!

1064
00:45:33,060 --> 00:45:34,390
So annoying...

1065
00:45:33,460 --> 00:45:35,150
I don't know...

1066
00:45:34,510 --> 00:45:36,380
Come, gather around these boobs.

1067
00:45:36,460 --> 00:45:36,940
Oh...

1068
00:45:49,700 --> 00:45:50,410
You know...

1069
00:45:52,020 --> 00:45:53,960
Even for people with bodies like yourselves...

1070
00:45:55,480 --> 00:45:57,920
Matsumoto seems to be worried about you.

1071
00:46:00,450 --> 00:46:01,090
So as of this moment...

1072
00:46:02,230 --> 00:46:02,830
He's arranged for someone to give you a massage

1073
00:46:02,830 --> 00:46:03,460
He's arranged for someone to give you a massage

1074
00:46:03,460 --> 00:46:04,930
He's arranged for someone to give you a massage

1075
00:46:07,640 --> 00:46:09,330
I'm sure you all have pathetic excuses of bodies...

1076
00:46:09,590 --> 00:46:10,680
but why don't you get one anyway...

1077
00:46:12,600 --> 00:46:13,190
Hamada!

1078
00:46:13,260 --> 00:46:13,810
Yes?

1079
00:46:14,160 --> 00:46:15,020
Do your shoulders feel stiff?

1080
00:46:16,080 --> 00:46:16,550
Nope...

1081
00:46:18,910 --> 00:46:19,710
Do your shoulder feel stiff?

1082
00:46:20,190 --> 00:46:20,660
No...

1083
00:46:21,140 --> 00:46:21,840
Great...

1084
00:46:23,280 --> 00:46:23,720
He really is like a bodhisattva

1085
00:46:23,720 --> 00:46:24,320
He really is like a bodhisattva

1086
00:46:24,320 --> 00:46:26,350
He really is like a bodhisattva

1087
00:46:28,370 --> 00:46:29,390
Well then, if you would...

1088
00:46:30,540 --> 00:46:32,010
Alright, let's start with Hamada

1089
00:46:30,560 --> 00:46:33,730
Thanks to Matsumoto, a masseur appears

1090
00:46:32,680 --> 00:46:33,690
Starting with me?

1091
00:46:33,850 --> 00:46:34,700
Yes, a massage...

1092
00:46:35,050 --> 00:46:35,480
Umm, okay...

1093
00:46:37,410 --> 00:46:38,290
My whole body is stiff...

1094
00:46:38,190 --> 00:46:39,010
This seems safe...

1095
00:46:38,950 --> 00:46:40,010
I am so stiff

1096
00:46:39,650 --> 00:46:40,290
It should be, right?

1097
00:46:42,650 --> 00:46:43,300
Is it okay?

1098
00:46:43,300 --> 00:46:43,960
Yes it is.

1099
00:46:46,490 --> 00:46:47,240
Is he okay?

1100
00:46:48,160 --> 00:46:48,890
It's a bit tough to say...

1101
00:46:53,150 --> 00:46:56,820
Bow and Arrow Lock

1102
00:47:05,570 --> 00:47:06,300
Wait, what?

1103
00:47:06,570 --> 00:47:07,340
We cannot help you...

1104
00:47:07,640 --> 00:47:08,930
Oh damn...

1105
00:47:29,410 --> 00:47:32,110
Look at all of you, doing your jobs...

1106
00:47:36,830 --> 00:47:38,430
Why does he scream "Ahh" himself?

1107
00:47:37,460 --> 00:47:39,790
Gaki no Tsukai Producer:

1108
00:47:37,460 --> 00:47:39,790
The World's Heipo

1109
00:47:38,710 --> 00:47:39,310
Right, this time...

1110
00:47:43,170 --> 00:47:44,960
And what?!

1111
00:47:53,080 --> 00:47:54,240
He hit his head...

1112
00:47:54,470 --> 00:47:55,340
Are you okay?

1113
00:48:00,080 --> 00:48:01,420
He didn't say anything...

1114
00:48:01,710 --> 00:48:02,740
What a failure...

1115
00:48:05,930 --> 00:48:07,410
What is he trying to achieve?

1116
00:48:08,960 --> 00:48:13,290
12 hours 50 minutes remaining

1117
00:48:08,960 --> 00:48:13,290
7:10 PM

1118
00:48:23,440 --> 00:48:24,760
Damn man...

1119
00:48:25,220 --> 00:48:26,580
It really does scare you...

1120
00:48:27,020 --> 00:48:29,100
Come, gather around these boobs.

1121
00:48:29,280 --> 00:48:29,800
Yeah...

1122
00:48:31,900 --> 00:48:33,070
Even for the likes of you

1123
00:48:34,250 --> 00:48:36,050
Matsumoto said, "Let them eat some good food."

1124
00:48:35,570 --> 00:48:36,780
Wow, that looks amazing

1125
00:48:36,850 --> 00:48:37,710
It truly is...

1126
00:48:38,370 --> 00:48:39,020
Amazing...

1127
00:48:40,040 --> 00:48:40,710
There's steak...

1128
00:48:40,600 --> 00:48:43,050
He arranged for a first-class chef to prepare your meals...

1129
00:48:44,380 --> 00:48:45,250
Awesome...

1130
00:48:45,970 --> 00:48:46,780
It's a special dinner.

1131
00:48:46,300 --> 00:48:47,830
Great...

1132
00:48:47,940 --> 00:48:48,680
His kindness

1133
00:48:48,900 --> 00:48:49,970
really can be felt by  your internal organs

1134
00:48:49,970 --> 00:48:52,230
really can be felt by your internal organs

1135
00:48:51,380 --> 00:48:51,980
Great, let's take this food then...

1136
00:48:52,210 --> 00:48:52,860
Dinner time...

1137
00:48:54,490 --> 00:48:55,000
What?

1138
00:48:55,400 --> 00:48:56,250
You have something to say, right?

1139
00:48:57,000 --> 00:48:57,890
Oh, enough of that stuff...

1140
00:48:57,750 --> 00:48:58,620
Yeah...

1141
00:48:58,340 --> 00:48:59,780
Not until you say your thanks...

1142
00:49:01,550 --> 00:49:02,220
Shall we say it together then?

1143
00:49:02,510 --> 00:49:03,950
Even for the likes of us,

1144
00:49:04,170 --> 00:49:05,950
Even for the likes of us...

1145
00:49:07,200 --> 00:49:08,710
you have given us this fantastic meal.

1146
00:49:08,710 --> 00:49:09,760
you have given us this fantastic meal.

1147
00:49:10,050 --> 00:49:11,280
you have given us this fantastic meal...

1148
00:49:11,280 --> 00:49:12,640
you have given us this fantastic meal...

1149
00:49:13,200 --> 00:49:14,140
Matsumoto-san,

1150
00:49:14,770 --> 00:49:16,140
Matsumoto-san...

1151
00:49:16,430 --> 00:49:17,610
thank you very much.

1152
00:49:18,110 --> 00:49:19,610
thank you very much...

1153
00:49:20,460 --> 00:49:21,630
Right then...

1154
00:49:31,030 --> 00:49:32,360
He's really quick when running away...

1155
00:49:35,110 --> 00:49:36,020
Ittadakimasu

1156
00:49:35,310 --> 00:49:39,980

Hoshi Ittetsu (Table Flipping)

1158
00:49:56,690 --> 00:49:58,250
God damn it!

1159
00:49:59,530 --> 00:50:01,400
I still had over half of my steak remaining...

1160
00:50:01,600 --> 00:50:02,040
For real?

1161
00:50:02,090 --> 00:50:03,250
I like to eat the most delicious

1162
00:50:03,660 --> 00:50:05,170
parts last...

1163
00:50:07,080 --> 00:50:08,620
Oh man, what a mess...

1164
00:50:10,920 --> 00:50:12,590
This is ridiculous!

1165
00:50:12,950 --> 00:50:14,950
My cushion was saved...

1166
00:50:14,080 --> 00:50:15,480
God damnit...

1167
00:50:15,750 --> 00:50:16,590
At least my cushion was saved...

1168
00:50:16,590 --> 00:50:17,890
At least my cushion was saved...

1169
00:50:18,260 --> 00:50:22,590
12 hours 20 minutes remaining

1170
00:50:18,260 --> 00:50:22,590
7:40 PM

1171
00:50:29,890 --> 00:50:31,730
Come, gather around these boobs

1172
00:50:32,340 --> 00:50:32,890
Alright...

1173
00:50:34,650 --> 00:50:35,630
We're sorry...

1174
00:50:36,390 --> 00:50:37,380
We went a bit too far...

1175
00:50:39,090 --> 00:50:39,990
Matsumoto-san said...

1176
00:50:41,450 --> 00:50:43,710
"You're probably tired, so eat these sweets" and handed me these

1177
00:50:43,710 --> 00:50:44,180
"You're probably tired, so eat these sweets" and handed me these

1178
00:50:44,180 --> 00:50:45,050
"You're probably tired, so eat these sweets" and handed me these

1179
00:50:45,050 --> 00:50:46,180
"You're probably tired, so eat these sweets" and handed me these

1180
00:50:46,180 --> 00:50:46,680
Matsumoto-san's kindness truly knows no bounds

1181
00:50:46,680 --> 00:50:47,990
Matsumoto-san's kindness truly knows no bounds

1182
00:50:47,990 --> 00:50:49,990
Matsumoto-san's kindness truly knows no bounds

1183
00:50:49,850 --> 00:50:50,660
No, I'm fine

1184
00:50:50,890 --> 00:50:52,140
Eat it; you must be tired

1185
00:50:52,650 --> 00:50:54,180
No, your hands are so sweaty...

1186
00:50:53,570 --> 00:50:54,500
Well obviously...

1187
00:50:57,210 --> 00:50:58,270
You must be tired...

1188
00:51:01,880 --> 00:51:03,380
It's so sticky...

1189
00:51:05,370 --> 00:51:06,210
You must be tired...

1190
00:51:06,620 --> 00:51:07,480
Oh no, no no...

1191
00:51:07,780 --> 00:51:08,530
You have to eat it...

1192
00:51:10,410 --> 00:51:12,410
I think it fell...

1193
00:51:11,530 --> 00:51:12,390
Hold on...

1194
00:51:12,920 --> 00:51:13,300
Here...

1195
00:51:15,380 --> 00:51:17,100
There's some stuff on it...

1196
00:51:18,680 --> 00:51:19,700
That's disgusting...

1197
00:51:24,210 --> 00:51:25,080
Just leave it out already...

1198
00:51:25,270 --> 00:51:26,030
Oh no, no no no...

1199
00:51:37,790 --> 00:51:38,980
What's he doing..?

1200
00:51:38,560 --> 00:51:39,810
This is ridiculous...

1201
00:51:41,610 --> 00:51:43,650
Tissue sticks...

1202
00:51:43,170 --> 00:51:44,230
What are you doing?

1203
00:51:50,500 --> 00:51:51,310
You're tired, right?

1204
00:51:55,970 --> 00:51:56,880
Alright, just leave it...

1205
00:51:58,900 --> 00:51:59,620
Don't spit it out, alright?

1206
00:52:04,500 --> 00:52:04,930
Matsumoto-san's kindness truly knows no bounds

1207
00:52:04,930 --> 00:52:07,070
Matsumoto-san's kindness truly knows no bounds

1208

Matsumoto-san's kindness truly knows no bounds

1209
00:52:08,710 --> 00:52:10,120
He said it twice...

1210
00:52:10,210 --> 00:52:11,110
He said the same damn thing twice.

1211
00:52:12,910 --> 00:52:17,240
12 hours remaining

1212
00:52:12,910 --> 00:52:17,240
8 PM

1213
00:52:16,420 --> 00:52:18,800
Oh wow, 8PM, 12 hours in!

1214
00:52:21,750 --> 00:52:23,550
We had like an hour-long wait between things happening...

1215
00:52:23,360 --> 00:52:24,190
I know...

1216
00:52:23,900 --> 00:52:25,060
Until one would come out...

1217
00:52:25,650 --> 00:52:26,790
And the whole time, we were terrified...

1218
00:52:33,680 --> 00:52:35,810
Matsumoto-san said that you must be bored,

1219
00:52:37,300 --> 00:52:37,960
so he said he'd let  you watch a film

1220
00:52:37,960 --> 00:52:40,330
so he said he'd let you watch a film

1221
00:52:41,370 --> 00:52:41,870
Matsumoto-san's popularity truly rings through the continents

1222
00:52:41,870 --> 00:52:44,240
Matsumoto-san's popularity  truly rings through the continent

1223
00:52:44,240 --> 00:52:44,840
Matsumoto-san's popularity truly rings through the continents

1224
00:52:44,840 --> 00:52:46,640
Matsumoto-san's popularity truly rings through the continents

1225
00:52:47,280 --> 00:52:48,030
Right then...

1226
00:52:47,900 --> 00:52:48,730
I wonder what film...

1227
00:52:49,310 --> 00:52:51,260
I might fall asleep if they dim it this much...

1228
00:52:51,040 --> 00:52:54,310
Film Starts

1229
00:52:51,480 --> 00:52:52,710
Oh man, this is scary

1230
00:52:52,610 --> 00:52:53,420
Yeah...

1231
00:52:58,860 --> 00:53:01,230
Why do we have to watch something like this?

1232
00:53:02,190 --> 00:53:02,970
Oh, there it is...

1233
00:53:02,660 --> 00:53:09,700
A youthful and chivalrous movie

1234
00:53:02,660 --> 00:53:09,700

1237
00:53:02,660 --> 00:53:09,700
Everyone from Tetsufutai, led by Hamada goes wild

1238
00:53:04,750 --> 00:53:06,050
Is this Hamada-san's "Sea of Japan"?

1239
00:53:06,780 --> 00:53:07,680
Seems so...

1240
00:53:09,930 --> 00:53:11,670
Hamada Masatoshi (28 years old)

1241
00:53:10,330 --> 00:53:11,180
Damn, you're young there...

1242
00:53:12,320 --> 00:53:13,700
He really is...

1243
00:53:15,270 --> 00:53:16,210
You are here...

1244
00:53:17,540 --> 00:53:19,410
I really am, huh?

1245
00:53:19,480 --> 00:53:20,500
You truly are

1246
00:53:24,310 --> 00:53:28,680
1 hour 40 minutes later

1247
00:53:37,060 --> 00:53:37,950
Oh my god, that was scary

1248
00:53:37,660 --> 00:53:41,500
Tetsufutai

1249
00:53:39,260 --> 00:53:40,270
That is not on...

1250
00:53:41,830 --> 00:53:42,660
We were so shocked

1251
00:53:52,730 --> 00:53:55,460
Of course we'll be shocked if someone jumps through there...

1252
00:53:56,640 --> 00:53:58,380
That was terrifying

1253
00:53:56,990 --> 00:53:58,410
I was just getting relaxed...

1254
00:54:00,580 --> 00:54:04,920
10 hours 15 minutes remaining

1255
00:54:00,580 --> 00:54:04,920
9:45 PM

1256
00:54:00,800 --> 00:54:01,720
Another 10 hours...

1257
00:54:01,460 --> 00:54:03,100
About 10 and a half hours...

1258
00:54:03,360 --> 00:54:05,750
Damn but 10 hours from this point on...

1259
00:54:05,090 --> 00:54:07,200
Yeah, that's going to be really tough...

1260
00:54:07,320 --> 00:54:08,790
I'm shattered...

1261
00:54:12,220 --> 00:54:14,350
Yamasaki!

1262
00:54:13,030 --> 00:54:17,030
Yamasaki Slap

1263
00:54:17,050 --> 00:54:18,930
Yamasaki!

1264
00:54:25,030 --> 00:54:27,900
He said Yamasaki; just give up man!

1265
00:54:27,460 --> 00:54:28,640
Please just hurry up and get caught

1266
00:54:28,240 --> 00:54:28,980
He's got him!

1267
00:54:29,220 --> 00:54:30,510
Oh no!

Okamoto Akihiko

1270
00:54:41,000 --> 00:54:42,920
His precious cat just ran off somewhere...

1271
00:54:43,550 --> 00:54:44,740
It literally ran away as fast as it could...

1272
00:54:45,010 --> 00:54:45,610
Hello there...

1273
00:54:45,460 --> 00:54:46,120
Hello...

1274
00:54:46,740 --> 00:54:47,410
Great work

1275
00:54:47,490 --> 00:54:48,060
Great work...

1276
00:54:49,180 --> 00:54:49,760
Hosei-san...

1277
00:54:49,970 --> 00:54:50,420
Zaki-san...

1278
00:54:50,330 --> 00:54:51,050
Are you okay?

1279
00:54:53,290 --> 00:54:54,460
This is bad...

1280
00:54:53,580 --> 00:54:54,490
This is bad...

1281
00:54:56,430 --> 00:54:57,810
My rib is done, man...

1282
00:54:58,730 --> 00:55:00,910
My rib is hurting so much...

1283
00:55:01,910 --> 00:55:03,870
He did run in shouting "Yamasaki!"

1284
00:55:03,960 --> 00:55:05,380
He was going for me from the start

1285
00:55:04,810 --> 00:55:05,640
It seems so

1286
00:55:05,860 --> 00:55:06,900
Unfortunately...

1287
00:55:06,160 --> 00:55:08,080
It said "Yamasaki slap"...

1288
00:55:19,080 --> 00:55:20,330
You reacted really quickly there...

1289
00:55:20,350 --> 00:55:21,880
You all reacted too...

1290
00:55:21,500 --> 00:55:23,150
No no, you were really quick

1291
00:55:22,360 --> 00:55:24,470
You all stood up straight away

1292
00:55:23,660 --> 00:55:27,010
No, we reacted to you

1293
00:55:25,600 --> 00:55:27,020
Oh, piss off...

1294
00:55:27,640 --> 00:55:28,670
I just can't get used to it

1295
00:55:28,180 --> 00:55:29,950
Come, gather around these boobs

1296
00:55:30,020 --> 00:55:31,010
Okay...

1297
00:55:31,780 --> 00:55:33,010
Matsumoto-san said that you're probably getting hungry around about now...

1298
00:55:33,010 --> 00:55:35,040
Matsumoto-san said that you're probably getting hungry around about now...

1299
00:55:35,920 --> 00:55:37,430
So he prepared you a late night snack.

1300
00:55:37,750 --> 00:55:40,280
Cup ramen

1301
00:55:37,750 --> 00:55:40,280
Present from Matsumoto

1302
00:55:39,060 --> 00:55:39,630
So eat up

1303
00:56:07,260 --> 00:56:08,980
That's really touch sensitive, huh?

1304
00:56:12,230 --> 00:56:14,080
Hey, that one's starting to smell nice

1305
00:56:14,230 --> 00:56:15,760
It does...

1306
00:56:16,140 --> 00:56:16,650
What?..

1307
00:56:17,820 --> 00:56:18,450
What's wrong?

1308
00:56:18,960 --> 00:56:19,540
You're kidding...

1309
00:56:19,350 --> 00:56:20,200
No way!

1310
00:56:21,160 --> 00:56:21,810
Are you serious?

1311
00:56:22,060 --> 00:56:23,600
That's so annoying!

1312
00:56:23,440 --> 00:56:24,230
You pig!

1313
00:56:27,190 --> 00:56:29,050
Oh man, this is so tough!

1314
00:56:28,770 --> 00:56:30,880
It's fine, let's eat this one altogether

1315
00:56:34,390 --> 00:56:35,170
Shall we do rock-paper-scissors?

1316
00:56:35,610 --> 00:56:36,300
Okay

1317
00:56:35,720 --> 00:56:36,430
Let's decide an order

1318
00:56:37,320 --> 00:56:38,050
Okay

1319
00:56:38,710 --> 00:56:40,820
Rock-paper-scissors

1320
00:56:44,660 --> 00:56:45,660
Okay, I will go first...

1321
00:56:48,540 --> 00:56:49,070
Sorry...

1322
00:56:48,940 --> 00:56:49,530
Ittadakimasu

1323
00:56:49,630 --> 00:56:50,110
Go for it

1324
00:56:53,210 --> 00:56:53,870
Oh, he went for the fried tofu

1325
00:56:56,660 --> 00:56:59,050
He's gone and eaten half of the 1 piece of fried tofu available...

1326
00:57:04,000 --> 00:57:05,140
And he's eaten half of what remains...

1327
00:57:05,710 --> 00:57:07,340
The fried tofu is the best part of this kitsune udon

1328
00:57:07,340 --> 00:57:09,810
The fried tofu is the best part of this kitsune udon

1329
00:57:10,860 --> 00:57:12,410
The soup is pretty good...

1330
00:57:12,240 --> 00:57:14,470
Yeah, it is

1331
00:57:14,950 --> 00:57:16,050
Damn, you eat a lot in one slurp...

1332
00:57:18,410 --> 00:57:19,400
You slurp like hell

1333
00:57:19,700 --> 00:57:20,450
The noodles all connected...

1334
00:57:20,450 --> 00:57:21,140
It really is, eh?

1335
00:57:21,870 --> 00:57:22,700
I thought it would be rude to just bite it off

1336
00:57:22,700 --> 00:57:23,420
I thought it would be rude to just bite it off

1337
00:57:22,810 --> 00:57:23,950
That's a bit weird, no?

1338
00:57:24,180 --> 00:57:25,060
I thought it would be rude...

1339
00:57:25,350 --> 00:57:26,290
I was trying to make sure it was

1340
00:57:25,370 --> 00:57:26,130
I mean...

1341
00:57:27,140 --> 00:57:27,570
clean for the next person

1342
00:57:31,140 --> 00:57:33,420
That's disgusting, c'mon Hosei-san...

1343
00:57:34,150 --> 00:57:34,680
I'm sorry...

1344
00:57:35,580 --> 00:57:37,750
Like loads of stuff flew back into the soup...

1345
00:57:36,410 --> 00:57:36,990
I saw you spit stuff up...

1346
00:57:37,620 --> 00:57:39,630
No, I didn't...

1347
00:57:37,820 --> 00:57:39,630
I saw it...

1348
00:57:39,640 --> 00:57:40,550
It did...

1349
00:57:40,320 --> 00:57:42,220
The spring onion got caught in my throat...

1350
00:57:41,850 --> 00:57:42,700
Are you sure?

1351
00:57:42,970 --> 00:57:43,660
It's fine...

1352
00:57:53,360 --> 00:57:54,490
That's disgusting

1353
00:57:55,510 --> 00:57:56,510
What the hell is wrong with you?

1354
00:57:56,590 --> 00:57:58,040
You disgusting little fucker...

1355
00:57:57,000 --> 00:57:58,680
It flew back into the soup again...

1356
00:57:58,880 --> 00:58:00,050
How does that happen?

1357
00:58:00,050 --> 00:58:00,690
Yeah...

1358
00:58:00,860 --> 00:58:01,980
Seriously, why does that happen?

1359
00:58:02,760 --> 00:58:04,150
I can't eat quickly...

1360
00:58:04,750 --> 00:58:05,970
And you were pressuring me...

1361
00:58:06,540 --> 00:58:07,830
What, I wasn't at all...

1362
00:58:12,940 --> 00:58:13,770
Damn, that piece is small...

1363
00:58:29,160 --> 00:58:30,620
Oh sorry, you have to stop.

1364
00:58:30,930 --> 00:58:31,510
It's one mouthful

1365
00:58:32,820 --> 00:58:33,990
Like if you bring your chopsticks away, you're done...

1366
00:58:33,990 --> 00:58:34,780
Like if you bring your chopsticks away, you're done...

1367
00:58:35,800 --> 00:58:36,540
Oh really?

1368
00:58:36,560 --> 00:58:38,030
Yeah, you have to do it all in one movement

1369
00:58:37,390 --> 00:58:38,220
Yeah...

1370
00:58:38,550 --> 00:58:39,770
You got to tell me that kind of stuff

1371
00:58:39,860 --> 00:58:40,520
Oh, sorry...

1372
00:58:40,970 --> 00:58:41,520
Really?

1373
00:58:41,520 --> 00:58:41,980
Yes

1374
00:58:42,310 --> 00:58:43,810
Okay, I'm going for my second go.

1375
00:58:46,160 --> 00:58:47,590
So I shouldn't have drunk the soup...

1376
00:58:48,280 --> 00:58:49,540
Yeah, because you lost out a bit there...

1377
00:58:57,410 --> 00:59:00,010
You got to tell me these kind of things from the start, I would have slurped way more...

1378
00:59:03,320 --> 00:59:04,490
My God, he's slurping away

1379
00:59:04,960 --> 00:59:07,180
Oh I get it, so those are the times you're meant to drink the soup?

1380
00:59:11,800 --> 00:59:12,710
Damn this is good...

1381
00:59:35,280 --> 00:59:36,530
Wait, this is okay?

1382
00:59:36,240 --> 00:59:37,270
This is okay...

1383
00:59:36,900 --> 00:59:38,670
His mouth is touching so it's okay.

1384
00:59:38,140 --> 00:59:39,610
In this instance, it's okay.

1385
00:59:40,110 --> 00:59:40,610
For real?

1386
00:59:40,610 --> 00:59:41,050
Yes

1387
00:59:41,510 --> 00:59:42,320
Under official rules,

1388
00:59:44,810 --> 00:59:45,600
next up is Hamada-san

1389
00:59:54,780 --> 00:59:55,110
Sorry, your turn is over

1390
00:59:55,110 --> 00:59:56,610
Sorry, your turn is over

1391
00:59:57,300 --> 00:59:58,250
You pulled your chopsticks away

1392
00:59:58,760 --> 01:00:01,090
Your movement in general stopped

1393
01:00:01,110 --> 01:00:03,940
Why? It didn't stop; I ate it and went to drink

1394
01:00:04,480 --> 01:00:05,890
I mean, you know

1395
01:00:08,000 --> 01:00:09,660
It's fine and all...

1396
01:00:10,010 --> 01:00:10,620
But I mean, yeah

1397
01:00:10,450 --> 01:00:12,660
Take it then

1398
01:00:13,460 --> 01:00:14,700
You know, I am your senpai and all...

1399
01:00:16,660 --> 01:00:17,340
We go in order again...

1400
01:00:19,850 --> 01:00:22,040
There's no point getting upset about something like this

1401
01:00:22,430 --> 01:00:23,380
It's just drinking now...

1402
01:00:24,080 --> 01:00:24,860
Yeah

1403
01:00:24,760 --> 01:00:26,070
Yeah, there are no noodles left.

1404
01:00:26,120 --> 01:00:27,030
Oh, he's going for it

1405
01:00:30,770 --> 01:00:32,280
Wait, what? This isn't right.

1406
01:00:32,940 --> 01:00:33,730
He's engulfing it...

1407
01:00:33,190 --> 01:00:35,850
Because I am doing that it's safe

1408
01:00:36,290 --> 01:00:37,160
I think...

1409
01:00:37,180 --> 01:00:38,070
You're good with engulfing...

1410
01:00:38,650 --> 01:00:39,730
Engulfing...

1411
01:00:39,070 --> 01:00:40,140
He's doing it too

1412
01:00:43,070 --> 01:00:43,800
Oh damn, he's engulfing it like hell

1413
01:00:45,100 --> 01:00:46,110
This is so called "engulfing"?

1414
01:00:45,990 --> 01:00:46,440
Yes it is

1415
01:00:46,660 --> 01:00:48,130
When you engulf it,  there's a certain limit to how much you can engulf

1416
01:00:48,130 --> 01:00:49,970
When you engulf it, there's a certain limit to how much you can engulf

1417
01:00:50,090 --> 01:00:50,940
Oh, I see.

1418
01:00:51,550 --> 01:00:52,430
Oh, are you at your limit?

1419
01:00:53,030 --> 01:00:53,530
I finished it...

1420
01:00:53,990 --> 01:00:54,620
Thank you

1421
01:01:09,340 --> 01:01:10,000
Just in case

1422
01:01:16,180 --> 01:01:17,060
There is a tiny bit

1423
01:01:25,620 --> 01:01:26,480
That was beautiful technique...

1424
01:01:26,790 --> 01:01:27,240
Yeah?

1425
01:01:27,240 --> 01:01:28,050
Yes, that was great

1426
01:01:28,000 --> 01:01:29,050
That was beautifully done

1427
01:01:30,020 --> 01:01:30,790
Oh man, I'm full

1428
01:01:30,790 --> 01:01:31,980
The fried tofu is so good

1429
01:01:33,150 --> 01:01:34,040
Great, I am full

1430
01:01:38,480 --> 01:01:41,650
Pitching ball machine

1431
01:01:45,010 --> 01:01:46,980
Damn he's fast!

1432
01:01:46,980 --> 01:01:47,740
I would hate this one...

1433
01:01:48,120 --> 01:01:49,050
If you get caught by this one, you're in serious trouble

1434
01:01:50,100 --> 01:01:50,900
This one is going to hurt...

1435
01:01:51,820 --> 01:01:52,910
I would hate this one...

1436
01:02:24,330 --> 01:02:27,500
Wonton noodles

1437
01:02:25,800 --> 01:02:26,900
What the hell is this?

1438
01:02:35,650 --> 01:02:36,520
Oh damn

1439
01:02:36,150 --> 01:02:36,820
Man, I was scared for a second there

1440
01:02:40,900 --> 01:02:41,500
What's this?

1441
01:03:04,570 --> 01:03:05,540
Damn, you smell of Wonton...

1442
01:03:06,000 --> 01:03:10,340
10:30 PM

1443
01:03:06,000 --> 01:03:10,340
9 hours 30 minutes remaining

1444
01:03:07,600 --> 01:03:09,010
We enter the night, their physical and mental strength is under strain

1445
01:03:09,010 --> 01:03:10,420
We enter the night, their physical and mental strength is under strain

1446
01:03:10,420 --> 01:03:12,360
We enter the night, their physical and mental strength is under strain

1447
01:03:14,290 --> 01:03:15,570
And at this point, that man's comment will again

1448
01:03:15,570 --> 01:03:17,370
And at this point, that man's comment will again

1449
01:03:18,220 --> 01:03:20,900
anger the other members

1450
01:03:28,300 --> 01:03:29,090
What's wrong with you now?

1451
01:03:31,040 --> 01:03:31,860
What's wrong with you now?

1452
01:03:32,200 --> 01:03:34,200
I have a fever...

1453
01:03:33,080 --> 01:03:33,810
You have a fever?

1454
01:03:35,270 --> 01:03:36,080
You have a fever?

1455
01:03:38,770 --> 01:03:40,570
You broke your rib, your rashes broke out, you cut your ear and now you have a fever

1456
01:03:40,570 --> 01:03:42,310
You broke your rib, your rashes broke out, you cut your ear and now you have a fever

1457
01:03:42,310 --> 01:03:44,180
You broke your rib, your rashes broke out, you cut your ear and now you have a fever

1458
01:03:43,640 --> 01:03:45,170
Apparently his rashes broke out too...

1459
01:03:44,180 --> 01:03:46,180
You broke your rib, your rashes broke out, you cut your ear and now you have a fever

1460
01:03:45,630 --> 01:03:46,750
Not in the slightest...

1461
01:03:54,820 --> 01:03:56,300
What the hell is that?

1462
01:03:54,890 --> 01:03:59,230
Diploma award tube

1463
01:04:15,710 --> 01:04:16,510
Give up already...

1464
01:04:42,730 --> 01:04:44,030
You did really well to outrun him...

1465
01:04:45,410 --> 01:04:47,410
See, your rib isn't broken, right?

1466
01:04:47,840 --> 01:04:49,770
It's too weird that you were moving your arms that well

1467
01:04:50,310 --> 01:04:52,380
It's a fracture, after all...

1468
01:04:51,560 --> 01:04:53,140
But even so,

1469
01:04:54,050 --> 01:04:55,230
however you look at it,

1470
01:04:56,000 --> 01:04:56,900
you looked healthy running...

1471
01:04:57,380 --> 01:04:58,250
No it's not that

1472
01:04:58,610 --> 01:05:01,150
When you're being chased, you have adrenaline going through you

1473
01:05:03,860 --> 01:05:08,030
10:53 PM

1474
01:05:03,860 --> 01:05:08,030
9 hours 7 minutes remaining

1475
01:05:08,190 --> 01:05:10,490
You, I'm going to smack you one, seriously.

1476
01:05:11,070 --> 01:05:12,830
You got way too scared just now...

1477
01:05:13,640 --> 01:05:14,540
You were the one...

1478
01:05:14,540 --> 01:05:16,220
You scared me...

1479
01:05:15,230 --> 01:05:17,130
It's because of him

1480
01:05:19,260 --> 01:05:21,360
Come, gather around these boobs

1481
01:05:21,190 --> 01:05:21,790
Okay!

1482
01:05:23,530 --> 01:05:24,230
Share this...

1483
01:05:26,300 --> 01:05:26,830
What is it?

1484
01:05:26,450 --> 01:05:26,990
Eat it together

1485
01:05:27,370 --> 01:05:27,970
Meat bun?

1486
01:05:28,950 --> 01:05:30,790
Another gift of food

1487
01:05:28,950 --> 01:05:30,790
Meat bun

1488
01:05:29,480 --> 01:05:30,720
Yes, it's a pork bun

1489
01:05:31,040 --> 01:05:32,140
I mean there are 4 of us

1490
01:05:32,140 --> 01:05:33,350
I mean there are 4 of us

1491
01:05:35,160 --> 01:05:36,560
I don't really like splitting these kind of things...

1492
01:05:37,270 --> 01:05:38,710
Well we've had cup noodles too...

1493
01:05:38,710 --> 01:05:39,460
Well we've had cup noodles too...

1494
01:05:40,260 --> 01:05:44,170
But you know, we can just split it down the lines on the bun

1495
01:05:45,530 --> 01:05:47,530
I think the order from before is fine...

1496
01:05:47,730 --> 01:05:48,450
I agree

1497
01:05:47,840 --> 01:05:48,550
Wait, why?..

1498
01:05:50,090 --> 01:05:51,070
I mean, doing rock-paper-scissors again is a bit...

1499
01:05:51,660 --> 01:05:52,700
It's a waste of time

1500
01:05:51,940 --> 01:05:53,330
Yeah, I agree

1501
01:05:53,980 --> 01:05:55,830
What, we have loads of time...

1502
01:05:56,420 --> 01:05:59,520
No listen, just cut it through the lines like this...

1503
01:06:00,060 --> 01:06:02,620
But some areas will have more meat than others...

1504
01:06:01,440 --> 01:06:02,160
That's true

1505
01:06:02,490 --> 01:06:04,940
It's not like the meat is going to be all

1506
01:06:05,510 --> 01:06:07,220
in the centre

1507
01:06:10,430 --> 01:06:11,350
Okay, well fine then

1508
01:06:11,390 --> 01:06:12,120
Alright, sorry about this

1509
01:06:13,160 --> 01:06:14,130
Yeah, we don't want to be taking too long

1510
01:06:14,350 --> 01:06:14,840
Yeah, it wouldn't be good

1511
01:06:15,290 --> 01:06:15,950
It's scary, after all

1512
01:06:17,050 --> 01:06:17,930
Okay, I'm going to take my bite...

1513
01:06:25,700 --> 01:06:26,500
Watch over there and eat...

1514
01:06:27,230 --> 01:06:28,120
Make sure you watch carefully while eating...

1515
01:06:29,090 --> 01:06:30,520
You never know when they may come

1516
01:06:32,850 --> 01:06:33,750
They could come anytime...

1517
01:06:34,490 --> 01:06:35,550
They really could...

1518
01:06:38,370 --> 01:06:39,300
There you go

1519
01:07:00,800 --> 01:07:03,550
You're all adults so you're probably not full quite yet, are you?

1520
01:07:06,500 --> 01:07:08,090
No, I'm pretty full

1521
01:07:06,500 --> 01:07:08,490
I'm pretty full

1522
01:07:08,270 --> 01:07:08,750
A bit

1523
01:07:09,270 --> 01:07:12,210
And so Matsumoto-san gave you another bit of food

1524
01:07:12,210 --> 01:07:13,060
And so Matsumoto-san gave you another bit of food

1525
01:07:13,950 --> 01:07:15,070
Why only 1 all the time?

1526
01:07:14,610 --> 01:07:16,140
He said take this...

1527
01:07:16,220 --> 01:07:16,820
Thank you!

1528
01:07:18,560 --> 01:07:19,370
Split it evenly...

1529
01:07:18,960 --> 01:07:21,700
A sausage

1530
01:07:18,960 --> 01:07:21,700
Another gift

1531
01:07:22,040 --> 01:07:22,770
This one's easy to split

1532
01:07:23,410 --> 01:07:24,590
There's only one again...

1533
01:07:27,490 --> 01:07:28,970
This is easy to split

1534
01:07:28,480 --> 01:07:29,020
Yep...

1535
01:07:29,330 --> 01:07:30,340
So far

1536
01:07:30,500 --> 01:07:32,040
Just split it into 4 and we're good.

1537
01:07:32,270 --> 01:07:35,990
We've had cup noodles and a meat bun...

1538
01:07:34,700 --> 01:07:37,860
Wait, wait, if you guys are full...

1539
01:07:38,670 --> 01:07:39,780
No, I'm feeling peckish for something small

1540
01:07:40,000 --> 01:07:41,560
It's a differentstomach

1541
01:07:41,560 --> 01:07:43,060
It's a different stomach

1542
01:07:42,640 --> 01:07:43,370
Yeah, a different stomach

1543
01:07:43,510 --> 01:07:44,250
A different stomach

1544
01:07:43,660 --> 01:07:44,250
to fill

1545
01:07:45,530 --> 01:07:47,930
Okay fine, let's just divide this into four...

1546
01:07:48,780 --> 01:07:49,290
But...

1547
01:07:50,060 --> 01:07:51,340
But if we split this into 4 parts...

1548
01:07:51,750 --> 01:07:52,390
The ends...

1549
01:07:52,160 --> 01:07:53,240
The ends...

1550
01:07:53,260 --> 01:07:54,670
It's softer in the centre

1551
01:07:54,550 --> 01:07:56,050
Oh who gives a shit?

1552
01:07:57,080 --> 01:07:57,960
Just man up...

1553
01:07:58,310 --> 01:07:58,810
Hang on a second

1554
01:07:59,250 --> 01:08:01,090
There's clearly a difference between here and here...

1555
01:08:01,760 --> 01:08:02,210
and that's the sticking point...

1556
01:08:02,320 --> 01:08:03,490
The edges, right?

1557
01:08:03,520 --> 01:08:03,970
Yeah...

1558
01:08:04,020 --> 01:08:04,620
What are you on about?

1559
01:08:04,030 --> 01:08:05,750
It shrinks at the ends...

1560
01:08:04,640 --> 01:08:05,730
It gets thinner

1561
01:08:06,090 --> 01:08:07,020
No it's not...

1562
01:08:06,400 --> 01:08:08,010
It is

1563
01:08:07,540 --> 01:08:09,320
Just open it and check then

1564
01:08:09,710 --> 01:08:10,800
The size doesn't change that much...

1565
01:08:12,460 --> 01:08:13,060
Keep a look out...

1566
01:08:17,050 --> 01:08:17,810
There's basically no difference...

1567
01:08:18,050 --> 01:08:18,880
It won't do...

1568
01:08:19,230 --> 01:08:19,890
Why not?

1569
01:08:20,150 --> 01:08:23,830
Because the edges are rounded

1570
01:08:24,590 --> 01:08:27,590
Wait, wait, why? Then you guys take the centre

1571
01:08:27,830 --> 01:08:29,970
and I'll take like this much from the edge

1572
01:08:30,530 --> 01:08:31,630
Then it's fine, right?

1573
01:08:31,390 --> 01:08:32,360
But then you'll be taking too much

1574
01:08:32,950 --> 01:08:33,660
Too much...

1575
01:08:34,690 --> 01:08:35,920
You guys don't want the ends, right?

1576
01:08:36,070 --> 01:08:38,860
Then I will take about this much from the end...

1577
01:08:36,180 --> 01:08:37,370
No I don't want it...

1578
01:08:38,940 --> 01:08:40,340
But then you'd be taking too much...

1579
01:08:40,870 --> 01:08:42,250
I don't think your seniority means anything here...

1580
01:08:42,640 --> 01:08:43,300
Alright, let's do this

1581
01:08:43,390 --> 01:08:43,820
Yup

1582
01:08:44,010 --> 01:08:45,790
We break it in half, and you guys start eating from the centre

1583
01:08:45,230 --> 01:08:45,650
Okay...

1584
01:08:45,790 --> 01:08:47,770
We break it in half, and you guys start eating from the centre

1585
01:08:48,340 --> 01:08:50,150
And then in exchange, just leave me about this much

1586
01:08:50,580 --> 01:08:51,310
Just the ends

1587
01:08:51,400 --> 01:08:52,340
Okay, yeah

1588
01:08:51,410 --> 01:08:53,460
Both ends

1589
01:08:52,470 --> 01:08:52,870
Yeah?

1590
01:08:53,660 --> 01:08:54,970
That would definitely work

1591
01:08:55,670 --> 01:08:56,130
Right?

1592
01:08:55,940 --> 01:08:56,270
Yes

1593
01:08:56,520 --> 01:08:57,640
That will definitely work

1594
01:08:59,090 --> 01:09:00,990
That way, no one has any problems...

1595
01:09:00,230 --> 01:09:01,010
Nope

1596
01:09:04,180 --> 01:09:04,760
Go for it

1597
01:09:11,270 --> 01:09:12,680
Leave some for Hamada-san, okay?

1598
01:09:13,210 --> 01:09:15,000
Just the end

1599
01:09:13,650 --> 01:09:15,010
Please leave Hamada-san some...

1600
01:09:23,920 --> 01:09:24,600
A bit for Hamada-san

1601
01:09:24,620 --> 01:09:25,590
Why are you putting it in your mouth once?

1602
01:09:29,400 --> 01:09:30,860
Why are you putting it in your mouth once?

1603
01:09:32,780 --> 01:09:33,570
You know what, I don't want any

1604
01:09:34,030 --> 01:09:35,200
Hold on a second, Hamada-san

1605
01:09:35,460 --> 01:09:38,100
We were having trouble because we were doing it your way

1606
01:09:37,390 --> 01:09:38,140
Wait a second...

1607
01:09:38,750 --> 01:09:40,090
You're putting it in your mouth once though...

1608
01:09:40,410 --> 01:09:40,800
Because...

1609
01:09:40,840 --> 01:09:41,910
We don't know how much to cut off...

1610
01:09:43,160 --> 01:09:44,370
You're holding it in your hand

1611
01:09:45,370 --> 01:09:48,540
Can you not just leave a tiny bit hanging out of your mouth and bite?

1612
01:09:49,530 --> 01:09:51,570
But it's rounded at the ends so it just slips in...

1613
01:09:51,910 --> 01:09:52,910
As we said before...

1614
01:09:53,680 --> 01:09:54,510
I'm putting it in my mouth once

1615
01:09:55,290 --> 01:09:57,310
No no, don't speak to me with your mouth full

1616
01:09:58,490 --> 01:09:59,750
Just hurry up and swallow it!

1617
01:10:00,360 --> 01:10:00,840
I'm sorry...

1618
01:10:01,320 --> 01:10:02,790
Wait, why the hell are you telling him to swallow it?

1619
01:10:01,430 --> 01:10:02,190
So rude

1620
01:10:03,620 --> 01:10:04,670
I thought it was rude...

1621
01:10:04,950 --> 01:10:05,930
What about my piece?

1622
01:10:08,210 --> 01:10:10,180
You have a little bit left, give that to me

1623
01:10:12,670 --> 01:10:13,920
Bite down and cut it

1624
01:10:16,670 --> 01:10:17,710
Why the hell are you putting it in, dumbass?

1625
01:10:19,620 --> 01:10:20,320
Bite it!

1626
01:10:21,040 --> 01:10:21,950
No, don't put it in!

1627
01:10:29,520 --> 01:10:30,290
There you go...

1628
01:10:32,690 --> 01:10:34,000
Why the hell can't you just bite it normally...

1629
01:10:36,730 --> 01:10:38,210
Why the hell can't you just bite it normally?

1630
01:10:38,070 --> 01:10:40,860
No because it's rounded at the ends...

1631
01:10:40,250 --> 01:10:41,460
I mean, why are you twisting it?

1632
01:10:41,860 --> 01:10:42,640
I couldn't...

1633
01:10:43,560 --> 01:10:46,050
Can you not just bite down? Why are you twisting it and all?!

1634
01:10:46,050 --> 01:10:46,530
I'm sorry

1635
01:10:50,320 --> 01:10:50,900
It's not your fault...

1636
01:10:51,940 --> 01:10:53,240
You've eaten your piece

1637
01:10:54,100 --> 01:10:55,310
No I don't want that...

1638
01:10:56,170 --> 01:10:59,260
We had a deal, I asked you just to leave me a tiny bit of the ends...

1639
01:11:00,010 --> 01:11:03,700
Just bite it and leave me just the ends... I mean he's twisted it off so it looks weird...

1640
01:11:05,490 --> 01:11:07,590
Could you not just leave me a tiny bit?

1641
01:11:08,440 --> 01:11:10,090
But if you look at it, you've gotten

1642
01:11:11,220 --> 01:11:13,870
I was trying to see how much to bite off so I...

1643
01:11:11,250 --> 01:11:12,180
a pretty decent piece...

1644
01:11:13,900 --> 01:11:15,160
Are you all fucking idiots?

1645
01:11:16,510 --> 01:11:17,310
I'm sorry...

1646
01:11:18,050 --> 01:11:18,680
We're really sorry

1647
01:11:21,400 --> 01:11:21,950
We're really sorry

1648
01:11:22,430 --> 01:11:23,050
We are really sorry

1649
01:11:24,050 --> 01:11:24,580
I will take care next time...

1650
01:11:26,110 --> 01:11:27,240
I just don't understand you lot...

1651
01:11:27,120 --> 01:11:27,830
We're so sorry

1652
01:11:27,550 --> 01:11:28,260
We're very sorry

1653
01:11:28,420 --> 01:11:29,050
We're so sorry

1654
01:11:29,600 --> 01:11:31,160
Damn, I'm full now...

1655
01:11:37,330 --> 01:11:40,660
11:10 PM

1656
01:11:37,330 --> 01:11:40,660
8 hours 50 minutes remaining

1657
01:11:43,430 --> 01:11:47,440
Stick

1658
01:11:44,120 --> 01:11:44,900
What the hell is this?

1659
01:11:45,130 --> 01:11:45,900
Wow wow wow...

1660
01:11:52,480 --> 01:11:54,020
Oh man, that looks bad

1661
01:11:55,540 --> 01:11:56,490
No way, you're kidding me!

1662
01:11:56,910 --> 01:11:57,890
Again?

1663
01:12:10,420 --> 01:12:10,920
No way...

1664
01:12:11,340 --> 01:12:11,960
Are you serious?

1665
01:12:13,140 --> 01:12:14,760
Wait a minute, I'm sorry, I'm sorry!

1666
01:12:24,380 --> 01:12:24,990
Are you okay?

1667
01:12:48,570 --> 01:12:49,230
Where are you going?

1668
01:12:49,310 --> 01:12:49,770
To the toilet

1669
01:12:51,600 --> 01:12:57,570
Yamasaki heads to the toilet alone

1670
01:13:37,430 --> 01:13:39,470
Oh come on!!

1671
01:13:37,550 --> 01:13:40,720
Pie

1672
01:13:39,510 --> 01:13:41,200
God damn...

1673
01:13:40,930 --> 01:13:42,700
Wait a minute!

1674
01:14:00,740 --> 01:14:01,630
That is terrifying...

1675
01:14:01,630 --> 01:14:02,990
Hey guys!

1676
01:14:04,030 --> 01:14:05,060
Hey guys!

1677
01:14:07,580 --> 01:14:08,410
I heard something...

1678
01:14:08,200 --> 01:14:09,370
Huh?

1679
01:14:08,830 --> 01:14:09,970
Hey guys!

1680
01:14:13,950 --> 01:14:14,610
What happened to you?

1681
01:14:15,190 --> 01:14:16,160
They were in the toilet!

1682
01:14:16,540 --> 01:14:16,980
What?

1683
01:14:17,470 --> 01:14:18,670
They were in the toilet!

1684
01:14:19,320 --> 01:14:20,010
The black things?

1685
01:14:20,320 --> 01:14:21,000
Yeah!

1686
01:14:21,410 --> 01:14:22,540
Are you serious?

1687
01:14:22,580 --> 01:14:23,210
3 of them...

1688
01:14:23,860 --> 01:14:24,580
No way!

1689
01:14:24,660 --> 01:14:25,670
In the stalls...

1690
01:14:26,440 --> 01:14:27,120
No way

1691
01:14:29,580 --> 01:14:31,060
And did you get to have a piss?

1692
01:14:31,830 --> 01:14:32,670
I was having a piss

1693
01:14:33,520 --> 01:14:35,200
and then they came out suddenly...

1694
01:14:36,500 --> 01:14:37,110
I was so scared...

1695
01:14:36,510 --> 01:14:37,230
That is so scary

1696
01:14:37,230 --> 01:14:38,330
That is so scary

1697
01:14:38,640 --> 01:14:39,410
Are you serious?

1698
01:14:39,450 --> 01:14:40,060
Yes!

1699
01:14:39,960 --> 01:14:41,320
That is a scary thought...

1700
01:14:45,040 --> 01:14:47,050
That's not cool man, this is like...

1701
01:14:46,650 --> 01:14:47,680
Oh it's going to fall off...

1702
01:14:47,410 --> 01:14:48,260
Oh, watch out...

1703
01:14:50,180 --> 01:14:51,740
Your face is properly messed up...

1704
01:14:53,240 --> 01:14:55,430
Your face has changed so much from when you went and came back...

1705
01:14:59,830 --> 01:15:00,480
3 of them?

1706
01:15:00,170 --> 01:15:00,960
I just heard a "Wah!"

1707
01:15:01,100 --> 01:15:01,610
Yeah...

1708
01:15:03,340 --> 01:15:04,330
I heard this little sound

1709
01:15:04,890 --> 01:15:05,470
and then when you turned..?

1710
01:15:06,630 --> 01:15:07,340
That is so scary!

1711
01:15:07,710 --> 01:15:08,930
They were just there when you turned around?

1712
01:15:09,410 --> 01:15:10,450
3 black things?

1713
01:15:12,090 --> 01:15:13,120
That is so scary...

1714
01:15:12,560 --> 01:15:14,400
I thought I was in serious trouble for a moment...

1715
01:15:17,320 --> 01:15:17,820
This is hell, seriously this is hell

1716
01:15:17,820 --> 01:15:18,280
This is hell, seriously this is hell

1717
01:15:18,280 --> 01:15:19,790
This is hell, seriously this is hell

1718
01:15:20,350 --> 01:15:22,520
There is no such thing as a safe place anymore

1719
01:15:25,150 --> 01:15:26,370
There's just so many of them.

1720
01:15:26,830 --> 01:15:27,330
Yeah I get you...

1721
01:15:31,090 --> 01:15:33,460
Because we're running around loads you probably think we're fine and all...

1722
01:15:33,070 --> 01:15:33,910
Yeah, that's true

1723
01:15:33,960 --> 01:15:35,430
For 1 of them to come out,

1724
01:15:35,260 --> 01:15:35,700
Yeah

1725
01:15:35,950 --> 01:15:37,740
we would wait for 30 minutes, sometimes 1 hour...

1726
01:15:37,740 --> 01:15:39,190
we would wait for 30 minutes, sometimes 1 hour...

1727
01:15:40,040 --> 01:15:41,670
The whole time, we were like this...

1728
01:15:40,950 --> 01:15:41,910
Yeah because we didn't know when...

1729
01:15:41,700 --> 01:15:43,560
And we're feeling nervous the whole time...

1730
01:15:43,370 --> 01:15:45,270
In the end, I wonder how much you guys ran...

1731
01:15:45,640 --> 01:15:46,860
Oh man, I don't know

1732
01:15:45,980 --> 01:15:47,170
You must have run loads.

1733
01:15:47,170 --> 01:15:48,570
Yeah, we did

1734
01:15:48,120 --> 01:15:50,110
Like tens of kilometres, right?

1735
01:15:49,600 --> 01:15:51,100
Oh for sure, definitely

1736
01:15:51,460 --> 01:15:53,300
Oh man, but seriously

1737
01:15:53,470 --> 01:15:54,790
That was something...

1738
01:15:54,480 --> 01:15:57,640
The balance between us started drifting...

1739
01:15:57,670 --> 01:15:58,520
What do you mean?!

1740
01:15:59,610 --> 01:16:00,520
Go on, tell him!

1741
01:16:01,320 --> 01:16:02,410
Surely, you know what I mean...

1742
01:16:02,800 --> 01:16:03,510
Like the idea even...

1743
01:16:02,950 --> 01:16:04,690
I'm sure he will say something again now...

1744
01:16:05,720 --> 01:16:07,100
The whole Senpai-Kouhai relationship too...

1745
01:16:07,170 --> 01:16:08,160
Oh yeah, that's true

1746
01:16:08,880 --> 01:16:11,930
But from here on, we start to get sleepy and it really gets...

1747
01:16:10,730 --> 01:16:11,500
That's right!

1748
01:16:12,750 --> 01:16:14,440
The strain on us...

1749
01:16:13,530 --> 01:16:14,560
That's right

1750
01:16:14,470 --> 01:16:16,500
And your muscles I bet start hurting about here...

1751
01:16:16,070 --> 01:16:17,310
That's right

1752
01:16:16,210 --> 01:16:18,010
Honestly, our muscles were already hurting here...

1753
01:16:19,350 --> 01:16:22,320
12:30 AM

1754
01:16:19,350 --> 01:16:22,320
7 hours 30 minutes remaining

1755
01:16:28,670 --> 01:16:31,680
As it goes past midnight, their fatigue starts to reach their limit

1756
01:16:30,490 --> 01:16:37,460
16 hours 30 minutes since the start

1757
01:16:30,490 --> 01:16:37,460
Their fatigue hits a peak. No one is even talking.

1758
01:16:32,550 --> 01:16:35,750
They don't even have the energy to talk to one another.

1759
01:16:44,230 --> 01:16:44,830
What is that?

1760
01:16:44,960 --> 01:16:45,360
What is it?

1761
01:16:48,970 --> 01:16:49,400
What is it?

1762
01:16:49,450 --> 01:16:50,200
What is it?

1763
01:16:49,720 --> 01:16:50,410
What has he brought?

1764
01:16:51,220 --> 01:16:53,030
Come, gather around these boobs

1765
01:16:53,260 --> 01:16:53,820
What is it?

1766
01:17:03,190 --> 01:17:03,870
What is it?

1767
01:17:04,550 --> 01:17:05,290
What is this?

1768
01:17:06,370 --> 01:17:07,150
Oh, futons...

1769
01:17:09,320 --> 01:17:11,050
I brought it as quick as I could

1770
01:17:13,740 --> 01:17:15,740
Time to turn out the lights

1771
01:17:15,350 --> 01:17:15,920
Lights out?

1772
01:17:18,030 --> 01:17:19,960
So we can carry on with the tag game,

1773
01:17:21,370 --> 01:17:22,210
shall we get some good night's sleep?

1774
01:17:23,630 --> 01:17:24,330
For real?

1775
01:17:24,400 --> 01:17:25,100
We get to sleep?

1776
01:17:25,100 --> 01:17:25,910
We're allowed?

1777
01:17:26,170 --> 01:17:27,150
I guess it is time to sleep, to be honest...

1778
01:17:27,550 --> 01:17:28,230
Let's get some nice sleep...

1779
01:17:30,050 --> 01:17:30,800
But lastly,

1780
01:17:32,200 --> 01:17:34,760
shall we wish Matsumoto-san goodnight together?

1781
01:17:37,050 --> 01:17:37,970
Matsumoto-san,

1782
01:17:38,690 --> 01:17:39,900
Matsumoto-san...

1783
01:17:40,190 --> 01:17:41,140
good night.

1784
01:17:41,410 --> 01:17:42,570
good night.

1785
01:17:48,800 --> 01:17:49,610
What the hell, man?

1786
01:17:56,680 --> 01:17:58,080
Why do I get kicked twice..?

1787
01:17:58,560 --> 01:17:59,110
I know

1788
01:17:59,340 --> 01:18:00,670
As if it's routine...

1789
01:17:59,590 --> 01:18:00,660
Yeah...

1790
01:18:02,430 --> 01:18:04,070
There's one futon set each by the looks of it

1791
01:18:04,120 --> 01:18:04,850
Damn, that one looks filthy...

1792
01:18:04,860 --> 01:18:06,410
The bag is filthy, I mean I'm sure it doesn't matter...

1793
01:18:05,560 --> 01:18:07,450
God it's filthy

1794
01:18:07,680 --> 01:18:09,190
Well I guess we have no choice...

1795
01:18:08,490 --> 01:18:09,550
Yeah, let's do it as the order before

1796
01:18:09,380 --> 01:18:09,970
I agree

1797
01:18:13,390 --> 01:18:14,770
Where should we put the futons?

1798
01:18:18,200 --> 01:18:19,540
The bag of my colour is totally different...

1799
01:18:21,020 --> 01:18:22,470
Who cares who gets that bag?

1800
01:18:22,970 --> 01:18:24,160
The colour was so different...

1801
01:18:24,670 --> 01:18:25,620
Aww man, it's so dirty...

1802
01:18:28,120 --> 01:18:28,670
Just my one...

1803
01:18:29,480 --> 01:18:30,830
We are doing this because of the order, after all...

1804
01:18:31,060 --> 01:18:31,840
Why the hell...

1805
01:18:33,080 --> 01:18:33,760
Right then...

1806
01:18:35,440 --> 01:18:36,840
It is pretty late; we do need to get some sleep...

1807
01:18:37,310 --> 01:18:38,350
After all this...

1808
01:18:40,810 --> 01:18:41,790
Oh man, this is a good one.

1809
01:18:41,650 --> 01:18:43,340
Oh yeah, Hosei-san, your one is so nice.

1810
01:18:43,980 --> 01:18:45,060
Don't you think my one is elegant as well?

1811
01:18:44,450 --> 01:18:46,470
Yeah

1812
01:18:45,390 --> 01:18:46,910
You're right, your one is so elegant...

1813
01:18:46,740 --> 01:18:48,080
It is, right?

1814
01:18:47,980 --> 01:18:48,920
I like this one as well to be honest

1815
01:18:48,940 --> 01:18:49,980
Have a quick look at mine too!

1816
01:18:50,040 --> 01:18:51,200
Oh yeah, that's an awesome one, green and all

1817
01:18:51,320 --> 01:18:51,890
It is, right?

1818
01:19:00,520 --> 01:19:01,320
Someone change with me...

1819
01:19:01,690 --> 01:19:02,430
Wow...

1820
01:19:03,130 --> 01:19:03,900
I don't want this...

1821
01:19:04,270 --> 01:19:05,470
Hey, switch with me...

1822
01:19:05,470 --> 01:19:06,130
Hey, switch with me...

1823
01:19:07,650 --> 01:19:09,220
Damn, your one is one size smaller, Hamada-san...

1824
01:19:10,690 --> 01:19:11,500
It's so small

1825
01:19:11,120 --> 01:19:12,100
I know

1826
01:19:12,950 --> 01:19:13,840
You'll be okay.

1827
01:19:13,870 --> 01:19:14,950
This is fine.

1828
01:19:15,710 --> 01:19:16,950
Just switch with me...

1829
01:19:17,820 --> 01:19:18,470
Right, let's get some sleep

1830
01:19:18,820 --> 01:19:19,220
Right...

1831
01:19:19,020 --> 01:19:20,030
Like seriously...

1832
01:19:22,880 --> 01:19:23,600
Right then!

1833
01:19:24,450 --> 01:19:25,280
Good night!

1834
01:19:26,900 --> 01:19:27,470
Damn, that's small!

1835
01:19:30,450 --> 01:19:30,950
You not going to put a sheet over?

1836
01:19:31,620 --> 01:19:33,180
Oh, no it's okay, this is clean anyway.

1837
01:19:35,780 --> 01:19:40,080
Lights out

1838
01:19:44,530 --> 01:19:46,840
Damn, it is tough to sleep on something hard like this...

1839
01:19:52,960 --> 01:19:56,410
As soon as the lights went out, the 4 fell asleep...

1840
01:19:59,920 --> 01:20:01,060
We were shattered by this point...

1841
01:20:00,860 --> 01:20:03,060
Oh yeah, we were

1842
01:20:01,320 --> 01:20:01,950
We were

1843
01:20:09,840 --> 01:20:12,220
And in the dark, approaches

1844
01:20:11,850 --> 01:20:18,190
A suspicious shadow approaches them...

1845
01:20:12,220 --> 01:20:13,450
And in the dark, approaches

1846
01:20:14,040 --> 01:20:15,480
a suspicious shadow

1847
01:20:48,190 --> 01:20:50,220
Did you eat dinner?

1848
01:20:50,220 --> 01:20:52,220
Are you eating well?

1849
01:20:51,810 --> 01:20:53,020
Yes, we are...

1850
01:20:54,460 --> 01:20:55,150
What time is it even?

1851
01:20:58,470 --> 01:20:59,590
Oh man...

1852
01:21:08,870 --> 01:21:10,870
You working hard?

1853
01:21:16,480 --> 01:21:17,650
You eating?

1854
01:21:17,660 --> 01:21:18,380
Am I eating?

1855
01:21:18,180 --> 01:21:19,520
Did you eat dinner?

1856
01:21:19,520 --> 01:21:20,920
Dinner...no I didn't...

1857
01:21:20,920 --> 01:21:22,020
Dinner... no I didn't...

1858
01:21:22,020 --> 01:21:24,190
You got to, man...

1859
01:21:24,190 --> 01:21:25,430
It's so important...

1860
01:21:25,800 --> 01:21:27,510
You guys were totally out, huh?

1861
01:21:29,410 --> 01:21:30,250
Right then, I'm off...

1862
01:21:31,410 --> 01:21:32,190
Oh, okay.

1863
01:21:32,410 --> 01:21:33,040
Good night.

1864
01:21:34,400 --> 01:21:35,120
Good night...

1865
01:21:35,490 --> 01:21:36,240
Good night

1866
01:21:38,860 --> 01:21:39,640
That was so scary...

1867
01:21:42,540 --> 01:21:46,850
1:15 AM

1868
01:21:42,540 --> 01:21:46,850
6 hours 45 minutes remaining

1869
01:21:52,120 --> 01:21:58,460
With no sound, Obachan-Oni appears

1870
01:21:59,660 --> 01:22:00,600
It's a ghost!

1871
01:22:16,980 --> 01:22:20,480
Deep Kiss

1872
01:22:36,220 --> 01:22:37,480
This is ridiculous

1873
01:22:36,900 --> 01:22:37,980
It's a ghost...

1874
01:22:49,720 --> 01:22:50,750
And then he falls asleep again...

1875
01:22:53,930 --> 01:22:55,150
That's a shock...

1876
01:22:54,150 --> 01:22:56,720
She stuck her tongue in again...

1877
01:22:57,310 --> 01:22:59,280
We were really tired here, man...

1878
01:23:04,340 --> 01:23:06,440
Oh man, that was so scary

1879
01:23:05,790 --> 01:23:09,630
Thai Kick

1880
01:23:12,190 --> 01:23:13,090
What, what, what?

1881
01:23:12,830 --> 01:23:14,160
Oh man...

1882
01:23:22,670 --> 01:23:24,200
This really is out of control...

1883
01:23:23,310 --> 01:23:24,770
Man that was a shock

1884
01:23:27,410 --> 01:23:28,360
It was so scary...

1885
01:23:30,950 --> 01:23:33,240
Is that allowed? Even when we're sleeping?

1886
01:23:33,480 --> 01:23:34,570
It shouldn't be, right?

1887
01:23:35,790 --> 01:23:39,900
Regardless of what is done to him, Hamada cannot shake off the sleepiness

1888
01:23:43,240 --> 01:23:44,710
You don't even wake up anymore...

1889
01:23:44,270 --> 01:23:47,670
Open palm strike

1890
01:23:47,080 --> 01:23:48,980
We don't have the willpower to run by this point...

1891
01:23:57,060 --> 01:23:58,310
We just let it happen...

1892
01:23:59,520 --> 01:24:00,130
So true...

1893
01:24:14,960 --> 01:24:19,300
2 AM

1894
01:24:14,960 --> 01:24:19,300
6 hours remaining

1895
01:24:32,020 --> 01:24:32,900
We had no idea about this

1896
01:24:32,910 --> 01:24:33,850
Yeah

1897
01:24:33,970 --> 01:24:35,630
Yeah, we were out by this point

1898
01:25:05,540 --> 01:25:06,160
What the...

1899
01:25:16,830 --> 01:25:22,000
Volleyball Machine

1900
01:25:18,320 --> 01:25:19,200
Oh man, this is terrifying!

1901
01:25:56,130 --> 01:25:57,820
He got two like right in the face...

1902
01:26:01,700 --> 01:26:03,470
There were so many of them!

1903
01:26:05,760 --> 01:26:06,450
Yeah, there were...

1904
01:26:06,280 --> 01:26:07,400
That was so scary...

1905
01:26:07,320 --> 01:26:07,840
I'm telling you

1906
01:26:08,210 --> 01:26:10,210
They're breeding and everything...

1907
01:26:09,780 --> 01:26:10,640
Yeah...

1908
01:26:10,780 --> 01:26:12,370
By the looks of it...

1909
01:26:11,040 --> 01:26:12,780
It's not right, there's so many of them

1910
01:26:14,060 --> 01:26:16,430
There were like different versions, ones that lit up...

1911
01:26:16,990 --> 01:26:22,330
2:30 AM

1912
01:26:16,990 --> 01:26:22,330
Remaining 5 hours 30 minutes

1913
01:26:35,070 --> 01:26:40,080
Hamada notices a suspicious rope

1914
01:26:41,510 --> 01:26:47,690
Rope

1915
01:26:51,510 --> 01:26:52,640
What was I doing?

1916
01:26:52,800 --> 01:26:54,180
It's a chimpanzee...

1917
01:26:57,440 --> 01:26:59,020
Look at this, it's a chimpanzee...

1918
01:26:59,870 --> 01:27:01,100
The monkey, the monkey...

1919
01:27:03,930 --> 01:27:05,110
He found a banana

1920
01:27:05,980 --> 01:27:06,780
There's something hanging there...

1921
01:27:07,080 --> 01:27:07,520
What is it?

1922
01:27:20,320 --> 01:27:24,660
Slap

1923
01:27:34,590 --> 01:27:35,440
What the hell...

1924
01:27:43,780 --> 01:27:44,500
I mean...

1925
01:27:45,600 --> 01:27:48,190
they didn't have to come from above just to slap us...

1926
01:27:55,450 --> 01:27:56,510
What dicks...

1927
01:27:58,230 --> 01:28:01,230
There are new species coming out now and all...

1928
01:28:01,500 --> 01:28:03,070
There weren't any of those kinds of Oni during the day...

1929
01:28:04,700 --> 01:28:06,460
They can move really well

1930
01:28:06,140 --> 01:28:06,840
Night species ones...

1931
01:28:06,950 --> 01:28:07,750
Which travel through the air...

1932
01:28:07,250 --> 01:28:08,240
Nocturnal species...

1933
01:28:07,770 --> 01:28:08,770
Yeah...

1934
01:28:09,390 --> 01:28:10,060
The night species...

1935
01:28:10,300 --> 01:28:11,110
Ones that also light up...

1936
01:28:12,420 --> 01:28:13,650
So there are species that appear at night?

1937
01:28:13,950 --> 01:28:14,910
I wonder if they're two different species...

1938
01:28:14,590 --> 01:28:15,560
Yeah

1939
01:28:14,920 --> 01:28:15,640
Like types?

1940
01:28:17,120 --> 01:28:19,540
Hamada's face was brilliant, wasn't it?

1941
01:28:17,210 --> 01:28:32,960
Batsu Game Headquarters

1942
01:28:20,100 --> 01:28:21,960
He made such a funny face

1943
01:28:22,480 --> 01:28:24,620
He, like, makes a face like a baby gorilla from time to time..

1944
01:28:24,750 --> 01:28:25,830
Yeah, he does!

1945
01:28:25,880 --> 01:28:26,590
Right?

1946
01:28:27,190 --> 01:28:28,750
Like you know, the huge eyes...

1947
01:28:29,750 --> 01:28:31,180
Yeah

1948
01:28:30,080 --> 01:28:31,240
Right? What's that about?

1949
01:28:31,710 --> 01:28:32,330
He so does do that

1950
01:28:35,500 --> 01:28:42,640
Check out Hamada's expression; it's like a baby gorilla's!

1951
01:28:43,370 --> 01:28:48,710
2:45 AM

1952
01:28:43,370 --> 01:28:48,710
5 hours 15 minutes left

1953
01:29:12,100 --> 01:29:15,970
Slap

1954
01:29:13,890 --> 01:29:14,700
This is so bad...

1955
01:29:14,670 --> 01:29:15,540
I can't do this

1956
01:29:15,890 --> 01:29:16,920
What the hell, man...

1957
01:29:17,310 --> 01:29:18,090
What the hell...

1958
01:29:27,320 --> 01:29:29,220
You guys probably got smacked...

1959
01:29:30,180 --> 01:29:31,110
He punched me..

1960
01:29:31,490 --> 01:29:32,230
Really?

1961
01:29:33,440 --> 01:29:34,270
That's exaggerating it too much...

1962
01:29:37,430 --> 01:29:38,740
Ow...

1963
01:29:37,740 --> 01:29:38,490
Tanaka, what's wrong?

1964
01:29:40,180 --> 01:29:42,200
It hurt so much!

1965
01:29:53,620 --> 01:29:54,460
Oh damn...

1966
01:30:00,720 --> 01:30:03,010
Come, gather around these boobs.

1967
01:30:08,160 --> 01:30:09,280
Gero-Gero, Gero-Gero

1968
01:30:09,280 --> 01:30:10,140
Gero-Gero, Gero-Gero

1969
01:30:11,480 --> 01:30:12,480
Matsumoto-san said

1970
01:30:15,210 --> 01:30:16,450
He will allow you to sleep now

1971
01:30:17,130 --> 01:30:17,530
Matsumoto-san's kindness truly can deceive a child

1972
01:30:17,530 --> 01:30:20,400
Matsumoto-san's kindness truly can deceive a child

1973
01:30:20,400 --> 01:30:22,440
Matsumoto-san's kindness truly can deceive a child

1974
01:30:22,130 --> 01:30:23,750
Hold on, who are you accusing of that!?

1975
01:30:24,680 --> 01:30:25,250
What?

1976
01:30:25,530 --> 01:30:26,430
What the hell...

1977
01:30:25,970 --> 01:30:27,650
He's obviously just woken up...

1978
01:30:29,780 --> 01:30:31,310
But he's saying that he'll let you sleep.

1979
01:30:32,740 --> 01:30:33,260
So yeah...

1980
01:30:42,240 --> 01:30:43,140
Time to sleep...

1981
01:30:43,200 --> 01:30:44,510
I wonder if we'll be able to...

1982
01:30:47,360 --> 01:30:50,320
The 4 finally get some peace

1983
01:30:47,600 --> 01:30:56,370
3 AM

1984
01:30:47,600 --> 01:30:56,370
5 hours remaining

1985
01:30:47,600 --> 01:30:56,370
Sleep Time

1986
01:30:50,950 --> 01:30:52,190
They were allowed some sleep.

1987
01:30:53,690 --> 01:30:54,790
The short period of rest

1988
01:30:55,920 --> 01:30:57,370
However, morning will come very soon

1989
01:30:57,370 --> 01:30:58,730
However, morning will come very soon

1990
01:30:59,490 --> 01:31:02,400
And once again, the reality which seems a nightmare...

1991
01:31:04,480 --> 01:31:08,450
2 hours 30 minutes remaining

1992
01:31:04,480 --> 01:31:08,450
5:30 AM

1993
01:31:16,360 --> 01:31:20,870
Wake up

1994
01:31:21,940 --> 01:31:24,100
There's no way we could wake up to this...

1995
01:31:23,130 --> 01:31:27,640
Chinko Machine

1996
01:31:24,000 --> 01:31:25,440
No way at all

1997
01:31:44,180 --> 01:31:45,480
Wow wow wow...

1998
01:31:54,160 --> 01:31:55,730
Oh man, that's awful

1999
01:31:58,140 --> 01:31:59,950
You would not want this first thing in the morning...

2000
01:32:23,100 --> 01:32:25,430
It's already morning...

2001
01:32:29,460 --> 01:32:30,970
I got my dick slapped first thing in the morning...

2002
01:32:31,910 --> 01:32:32,570
For real?

2003
01:32:36,860 --> 01:32:38,620
They really do ridiculous things...

2004
01:32:46,790 --> 01:32:51,290
Ladle

2005
01:32:50,920 --> 01:32:52,280
This is so scary as well...

2006
01:33:22,890 --> 01:33:24,100
That's amazing...

2007
01:33:37,220 --> 01:33:38,400
You...

2008
01:33:37,710 --> 01:33:39,060
When will we get used to it?

2009
01:33:39,440 --> 01:33:41,570
Come, gather around these boobs!

2010
01:33:46,380 --> 01:33:47,800
God sakes...

2011
01:33:49,260 --> 01:33:50,480
Maple buns!

2012
01:33:53,970 --> 01:33:54,830
It's time to wake up

2013
01:33:57,130 --> 01:33:57,720
Morning

2014
01:33:57,870 --> 01:33:59,500
You're all wrecked here...

2015
01:33:58,950 --> 01:34:00,570
First of all, shall wesay good morning to Matsumoto-san?

2016
01:34:00,570 --> 01:34:01,800
First of all, shall we say good morning to Matsumoto-san?

2017
01:34:03,590 --> 01:34:04,350
Come on, guys.

2018
01:34:08,570 --> 01:34:09,170
Let's do it...

2019
01:34:09,990 --> 01:34:11,110
Matsumoto-san

2020
01:34:16,640 --> 01:34:17,240
Hamada

2021
01:34:18,750 --> 01:34:19,160
Hamada

2022
01:34:19,260 --> 01:34:19,860
Yeah...

2023
01:34:21,940 --> 01:34:23,200
It's morning, so let's start by saying good morning...

2024
01:34:24,290 --> 01:34:26,270
If you don't do this, the rest of these guys won't do it

2025
01:34:30,740 --> 01:34:31,290
So here we go

2026
01:34:33,200 --> 01:34:34,240
Matsumoto-san

2027
01:34:36,110 --> 01:34:36,990
Matsumoto-san...

2028
01:34:37,980 --> 01:34:38,470
Guys

2029
01:34:39,410 --> 01:34:41,040
Hamada's saying it, so why aren't you?

2030
01:34:42,650 --> 01:34:43,510
He's so annoying!

2031
01:34:42,680 --> 01:34:43,470
Let's try again...

2032
01:34:45,550 --> 01:34:46,600
Matsumoto-san

2033
01:34:47,230 --> 01:34:48,540
Matsumoto-san

2034
01:34:49,330 --> 01:34:50,580
Good morning

2035
01:34:51,160 --> 01:34:52,570
Good morning...

2036
01:34:58,390 --> 01:34:59,330
Chewing Bon...

2037
01:35:02,230 --> 01:35:02,890
Here's your breakfast

2038
01:35:04,040 --> 01:35:05,360
Matsumoto-san said

2039
01:35:07,550 --> 01:35:09,220
you got to work hard again today,

2040
01:35:11,320 --> 01:35:13,920
so he arranged you a meal to give you some strength back

2041
01:35:14,450 --> 01:35:15,230
Well then, eat.

2042
01:35:30,170 --> 01:35:31,620
So he has nothing to say about this, huh?

2043
01:35:34,320 --> 01:35:39,660
2 hours remain

2044
01:35:34,320 --> 01:35:39,660

2045
01:35:34,320 --> 01:35:39,660
Breakfast Time

2046
01:35:34,450 --> 01:35:35,860
Hey, it's warm

2047
01:35:36,520 --> 01:35:37,320
Oh awesome

2048
01:35:36,860 --> 01:35:38,240
This looks pretty tasty

2049
01:35:51,540 --> 01:35:55,210
Gang

2050
01:35:53,200 --> 01:35:54,020
What the...

2051
01:36:07,190 --> 01:36:08,740
What? What is it?

2052
01:36:15,550 --> 01:36:16,300
This is ridiculous...

2053
01:36:30,900 --> 01:36:32,860
I thought they might take you away for us...

2054
01:36:42,440 --> 01:36:43,130
Just water?

2055
01:36:42,880 --> 01:36:43,360
Looks it

2056
01:36:43,960 --> 01:36:44,770
I'm so cold...

2057
01:36:48,200 --> 01:36:52,540
1 hour 18 minutes left

2058
01:36:48,200 --> 01:36:52,540
6:42 AM

2059
01:36:59,840 --> 01:37:04,020
Thai Kick

2060
01:37:02,060 --> 01:37:04,190
No way, no way am I getting caught!

2061
01:37:04,590 --> 01:37:05,430
No way in hell!

2062
01:37:13,820 --> 01:37:15,610
Oh damn, a Thai Kick...

2063
01:37:19,200 --> 01:37:22,150
From 7 in the morning...

2064
01:37:22,150 --> 01:37:22,650
This will be tough to take...

2065
01:37:28,750 --> 01:37:30,790
Wait, what?

2066
01:37:29,110 --> 01:37:29,960
Holy shit...

2067
01:37:31,770 --> 01:37:32,840
That's just...

2068
01:37:39,040 --> 01:37:40,990
3 in a row is tough...

2069
01:37:42,460 --> 01:37:44,590
Oh man, oh man, oh man...

2070
01:37:43,820 --> 01:37:47,490
Open palm strike

2071
01:38:04,100 --> 01:38:04,950
Damn...

2072
01:38:08,210 --> 01:38:12,550
1 hour 1 minute remaining

2073
01:38:08,210 --> 01:38:12,550
6:59 AM

2074
01:38:09,930 --> 01:38:10,500
Time left

2075
01:38:11,290 --> 01:38:12,610
Just over 1 hour

2076
01:38:14,830 --> 01:38:16,340
However, the 4 cannot converse

2077
01:38:15,420 --> 01:38:21,730
The 4 have lost the will to have a conversation

2078
01:38:16,340 --> 01:38:18,050
However, the 4 cannot converse

2079
01:38:19,120 --> 01:38:22,240
and there is no joy at the fact the end is so near

2080
01:38:22,240 --> 01:38:22,920
and there is no joy at the fact the end is so near

2081
01:38:38,010 --> 01:38:42,180
Volleyball Machine

2082
01:38:38,390 --> 01:38:39,040
Oh man...

2083
01:39:01,240 --> 01:39:02,040
This would be...

2084
01:39:01,590 --> 01:39:02,500
This is horrible...

2085
01:39:02,840 --> 01:39:03,990
This is like so bad..

2086
01:39:07,380 --> 01:39:08,210
Oh man, I'm scared...

2087
01:39:28,200 --> 01:39:29,880
This really hurts...

2088
01:39:34,270 --> 01:39:35,470
Oh damn...

2089
01:39:44,010 --> 01:39:49,320
27 minutes remaining

2090
01:39:44,010 --> 01:39:49,320
7:33 AM

2091
01:39:52,630 --> 01:39:53,100

2092
01:39:53,030 --> 01:39:54,300
Oh man...

2093
01:39:53,520 --> 01:39:57,190
Open palm strike

2094
01:39:55,600 --> 01:39:56,310
Hey, something's hanging out...

2095
01:39:56,170 --> 01:39:56,820
You're right

2096
01:39:57,000 --> 01:39:57,770
What is?

2097
01:39:58,200 --> 01:39:59,280
Oh, his dick...

2098
01:40:32,260 --> 01:40:33,030
This is ridiculous

2099
01:40:35,560 --> 01:40:36,500
This is just ridiculous

2100
01:40:39,410 --> 01:40:40,720
He gets caught and then that happens...

2101
01:40:57,480 --> 01:40:59,230
If this wasn't TV, I would have stabbed him..

2102
01:41:09,730 --> 01:41:14,070
7 minutes remaining

2103
01:41:09,730 --> 01:41:14,070
7:53 AM

2104
01:41:13,790 --> 01:41:16,160
We've finally gotten this far...

2105
01:41:15,200 --> 01:41:16,170
Yeah we did...

2106
01:41:17,730 --> 01:41:18,980
Finally...

2107
01:41:21,010 --> 01:41:21,480
But you can't let your guarddown until we've finished

2108
01:41:21,480 --> 01:41:23,680
But you can't let your guard down until we've finished

2109
01:41:22,470 --> 01:41:22,990
That's true

2110
01:41:23,230 --> 01:41:23,830
So true

2111
01:41:29,390 --> 01:41:32,360
Gaki no Tsukai Producer:

2112
01:41:29,390 --> 01:41:32,360

2113
01:41:33,090 --> 01:41:33,670
Let's just get him

2114
01:41:33,450 --> 01:41:34,540
This is awful

2115
01:41:35,210 --> 01:41:35,780
Get him

2116
01:41:35,310 --> 01:41:37,380
He's such a dick...

2117
01:41:36,790 --> 01:41:38,610
He really is just a...

2118
01:42:02,980 --> 01:42:04,170
There's no way you can win against us from the start...

2119
01:42:06,990 --> 01:42:09,630
He must have thought he could do it to us because everyone else was...

2120
01:42:10,670 --> 01:42:12,530
That's actually quite shocking; it annoys me

2121
01:42:13,370 --> 01:42:13,960
I know, right?

2122
01:42:16,130 --> 01:42:20,470
4 minutes remaining

2123
01:42:16,130 --> 01:42:20,470

2124
01:42:22,610 --> 01:42:25,320
I have never waited for 8 o'clock like this in my life...

2125
01:42:34,630 --> 01:42:36,080
Seriously guys, let's get used to this sound now...

2126
01:42:38,160 --> 01:42:38,910
You were as well...

2127
01:42:39,130 --> 01:42:41,110
Come, gather around these boobs

2128
01:42:39,140 --> 01:42:39,940
Yeah, Hamada-san...

2129
01:42:41,690 --> 01:42:42,140
You're right...

2130
01:42:46,610 --> 01:42:47,550
Ready, set.

2131
01:42:47,760 --> 01:42:49,520
Come, gather around these boobs

2132
01:42:50,010 --> 01:42:50,700
Just as I thought

2133
01:42:55,040 --> 01:42:56,850
You guys have nearly done your 24 hours

2134
01:42:58,940 --> 01:43:00,070
Only 3 and a bit minutes left...

2135
01:43:00,550 --> 01:43:01,900
Come on...

2136
01:43:01,140 --> 01:43:01,870
Thank you...

2137
01:43:02,280 --> 01:43:02,900
How was it?

2138
01:43:03,850 --> 01:43:05,150
It was just ridiculous...

2139
01:43:08,850 --> 01:43:09,340
Endo?

2140
01:43:10,300 --> 01:43:11,390
No seriously, it was ridiculous

2141
01:43:11,530 --> 01:43:12,300
Was it?

2142
01:43:14,880 --> 01:43:15,310
How about you, Tanaka?

2143
01:43:15,310 --> 01:43:15,930
It was so tough

2144
01:43:18,350 --> 01:43:18,850
Hamada?

2145
01:43:19,670 --> 01:43:20,040
Yeah...

2146
01:43:20,210 --> 01:43:20,800
How was it?

2147
01:43:24,350 --> 01:43:25,730
I am just defeated

2148
01:43:27,170 --> 01:43:28,370
And all of that was truly thanks to Matsumoto-san, right?

2149
01:43:28,370 --> 01:43:28,970
And all of that was truly thanks to Matsumoto-san, right?

2150
01:43:28,970 --> 01:43:31,410
And all of that was truly thanks to Matsumoto-san, right?

2151
01:43:31,410 --> 01:43:32,410
That man really is an amazing person

2152
01:43:32,410 --> 01:43:34,410
That man really is an amazing person

2153
01:43:35,130 --> 01:43:35,950
The final 10 seconds, let's do a countdown

2154
01:43:35,950 --> 01:43:38,350
The final 10 seconds, let's do a countdown

2155
01:43:39,650 --> 01:43:42,960
Man, this was ridiculous, it was tough.

2156

2157
01:43:45,330 --> 01:43:47,180
It was an amazing Batsu...

2158

I know, right?..

2161
01:43:53,260 --> 01:43:54,200
Where is it?

2162
01:43:54,750 --> 01:43:55,420
It's just terrifying

2163
01:43:56,110 --> 01:43:57,010
It really is...

2164
01:44:02,240 --> 01:44:05,020
Oh man, this is scary, we don't know where they could appear from now...

2165
01:44:07,070 --> 01:44:08,790
Your rib broke, your rashes broke out and now you have a fever?

2166
01:44:08,790 --> 01:44:10,490
Your rib broke, your rashes broke out and now you have a fever?

2167
01:44:10,490 --> 01:44:11,270
Your rib broke, your rashes broke out and now you have a fever?

2168
01:44:13,720 --> 01:44:14,600
Hold on a minute!

2169

You know what, I don't want it

2170
01:44:17,950 --> 01:44:19,120
Wait wait...

Wow what, were we all here together?

2207
01:45:47,030 --> 01:45:48,040
I was actually over there...

2208
01:45:48,810 --> 01:45:49,790
But then they chased me here...

2209
01:45:54,580 --> 01:45:55,050
Damn...

2210
01:45:54,650 --> 01:45:55,830
We finished though...

2211
01:45:56,220 --> 01:45:57,170
How many of them were there?..

2212
01:45:57,590 --> 01:45:59,410
Loads, like 200?

2213
01:45:59,780 --> 01:46:00,760
Are you serious?

2214
01:46:00,830 --> 01:46:02,050
It was just pitch black

2215
01:46:07,000 --> 01:46:10,410
24-hour endurance tag game

2216
01:46:07,000 --> 01:46:10,410
Complete

2217
01:46:11,070 --> 01:46:11,670
Great job, guys

2218
01:46:11,940 --> 01:46:12,900
Great job

2219
01:46:14,430 --> 01:46:15,020
Thank you...

2220
01:46:18,380 --> 01:46:19,710
So what are we going to do now?

2221
01:46:20,400 --> 01:46:21,020
I mean...

2222
01:46:22,480 --> 01:46:24,040
We'll battle as a team of 4

2223
01:46:24,040 --> 01:46:25,460
We'll battle as a team of 4

2224
01:46:27,060 --> 01:46:28,150
against Matsumoto-san

2225
01:46:28,640 --> 01:46:29,660
and defeat him...

2226
01:46:29,420 --> 01:46:29,750
Yeah...

2227
01:46:30,130 --> 01:46:31,690
Let's win, whatever happens

2228
01:46:32,590 --> 01:46:33,200
I guess that's how it is?

2229
01:46:33,410 --> 01:46:33,870
Yeah...

2230
01:46:34,210 --> 01:46:36,810
I think our teamwork really came out in there...

2231
01:46:36,920 --> 01:46:39,360
Yeah, we have a really strong bond now...

2232
01:46:40,740 --> 01:46:41,440
I mean honestly...

2233
01:46:41,430 --> 01:46:42,130
Yeah...

2234
01:46:42,770 --> 01:46:43,710
I, like, love you guys...

2235
01:46:43,710 --> 01:46:45,710
I, like, love you guys...

2236
01:46:46,780 --> 01:46:47,600
Well, that's how it is

2237
01:46:47,660 --> 01:46:48,640
I see.

2238
01:46:49,000 --> 01:46:49,610
Please pass on the message

2239
01:46:49,710 --> 01:46:50,530
Okay, I will

2240
01:46:51,890 --> 01:46:52,820
Okay then, thank you very much

2241
01:46:52,820 --> 01:46:53,240
I'm off

2242
01:46:53,250 --> 01:46:53,810
Great job!

2243
01:46:53,970 --> 01:46:54,780
Thank you!

2244
01:46:54,780 --> 01:46:55,300
Thank you

2245
01:46:58,820 --> 01:46:59,800
Great job, guys

2246
01:47:00,440 --> 01:47:01,090
Great job

2247
01:47:03,890 --> 01:47:04,990
Please don't...

2248
01:47:11,460 --> 01:47:12,310
The bond...

2249
01:47:11,950 --> 01:47:12,570
between us...

2250
01:47:12,640 --> 01:47:13,680
What happened to the bond?

2251
01:47:13,700 --> 01:47:15,540
I know, what happened to it?

2252
01:47:16,940 --> 01:47:17,710
I bet the person who pressed close was Hamada-san...

2253
01:47:17,710 --> 01:47:20,040
I bet the person who pressed close was Hamada-san...

2254
01:47:24,760 --> 01:47:25,760
Well, we did it

2255
01:47:26,110 --> 01:47:26,760
We did...

2256
01:47:26,820 --> 01:47:27,640
You did indeed...

2257
01:47:27,040 --> 01:47:29,240
Oh man..

2258
01:47:28,720 --> 01:47:30,140
This must have been very hard...

2259
01:47:29,940 --> 01:47:30,930
Oh man...

2260
01:47:30,670 --> 01:47:31,560
It really was...

2261
01:47:31,820 --> 01:47:33,850
It really was tough

2262
01:47:33,370 --> 01:47:36,430
I mean watching it alone was tough... Well anyway, well done

2263
01:47:36,850 --> 01:47:39,900
on completing part one of five Batsu games...

2264
01:47:40,900 --> 01:47:41,820
What are you on about, of 5?

2265
01:47:41,480 --> 01:47:42,530
No no no...

2266
01:47:42,840 --> 01:47:43,860
What you mean of 5...

2267
01:47:43,850 --> 01:47:44,880
That's what I've heard

2268
01:47:44,760 --> 01:47:46,500
I haven't heard that, you fool!

2269
01:47:46,170 --> 01:47:47,170
No way

2270
01:47:46,810 --> 01:47:48,530
What the hell do you mean, part one of five?

2271
01:47:48,920 --> 01:47:50,080
So there's a Part 2, Part 3...

2272
01:47:50,080 --> 01:47:51,460
Are you stupid?!

2273
01:47:50,830 --> 01:47:51,800
No way...

2274
01:47:51,610 --> 01:47:52,910
That was more than enough

2275
01:47:52,610 --> 01:47:54,190
That really was

2276
01:47:55,430 --> 01:47:56,690
If we're going to do another battle in the future...

2277
01:47:56,690 --> 01:47:57,100
Yeah

2278
01:47:57,280 --> 01:47:59,430
We could split it like 2 vs 3 or...

2279
01:47:59,490 --> 01:47:59,900
Yeah

2280
01:47:59,990 --> 01:48:01,740
Or like this...

2281
01:48:01,590 --> 01:48:02,520
No, let's do this

2282
01:48:02,100 --> 01:48:03,360
I think this is going to happen for sure...

2283
01:48:03,660 --> 01:48:04,760
Let's do it like this

2284
01:48:04,350 --> 01:48:05,100
Like this

2285
01:48:05,390 --> 01:48:07,830
I mean, that's fine and all but...

2286
01:48:08,010 --> 01:48:10,220
In April, Yamasaki-san will...

2287
01:48:14,130 --> 01:48:14,790
Really?!

2288
01:48:14,860 --> 01:48:15,650
Really?

2289
01:48:16,470 --> 01:48:17,370
He's leaving?

2290
01:48:17,410 --> 01:48:18,010
Yeah...

2291
01:48:18,850 --> 01:48:19,690
I'm leaving?!

2292
01:48:22,170 --> 01:48:24,630
No, I'm not leaving!

2293
01:48:25,220 --> 01:48:25,790
No way

2294
01:48:25,220 --> 01:48:28,940
No because then there's 4 of us so it's easy to match the teams...

2295
01:48:28,130 --> 01:48:29,490
Oh yeah, that's true

2296
01:48:29,120 --> 01:48:31,550
No no no, it's got to be 4 vs 1...

2297
01:48:31,850 --> 01:48:33,990
and if you want a helper, you can have Heipo-san...

2298
01:48:34,910 --> 01:48:35,770
See, and you're not funny in the slightest...

2299
01:48:35,790 --> 01:48:36,360
No no no!

2300
01:48:37,290 --> 01:48:38,830
That was just such an awful joke!

2301
01:48:39,950 --> 01:48:42,090
Would you 3 like to go against Downtown?

2302
01:48:42,210 --> 01:48:43,400
What, like 3 vs 2?

2303
01:48:44,830 --> 01:48:47,670
But I mean Hamada-san, don't you think you should be in our team?

2304
01:48:47,760 --> 01:48:49,070
After getting that much done to you?

2305
01:48:49,430 --> 01:48:50,430
Well it depends on what the battle will be...

2306
01:48:52,640 --> 01:48:53,270
I guess that's true

2307
01:48:52,980 --> 01:48:56,100
But on a separate note, let's definitely do Downtown vs Cocorico...

2308
01:48:57,660 --> 01:48:58,380
Oh yeah, sure...

2309
01:48:58,990 --> 01:49:00,130
Like against each other?

2310
01:48:59,920 --> 01:49:00,880
Yeah, please

2311
01:49:00,580 --> 01:49:02,080
We will do our best.

2312
01:49:01,820 --> 01:49:03,060
We will try and win...

2313
01:49:03,850 --> 01:49:04,370
We will...

2314
01:49:04,270 --> 01:49:05,540
Cheers for everything, Yamasaki...

2315
01:49:07,330 --> 01:49:08,140
Thanks a lot...

2316
01:49:08,660 --> 01:49:09,530
Thank you very much...

2317
01:49:11,640 --> 01:49:12,580
What are you saying?

2318
01:49:12,600 --> 01:49:13,640
We're just messing with you!

2319
01:49:13,700 --> 01:49:16,540
We're just kidding... Damn, he's tearing up!

2320
01:49:21,930 --> 01:49:25,240
Back then...

2321
01:49:27,460 --> 01:49:28,500
Well, that's how it is

2322
01:49:28,300 --> 01:49:29,430
Ahh, I see

2323
01:49:29,500 --> 01:49:32,280
So we've done the 24 hour endurance tag...

2324
01:49:32,010 --> 01:49:32,800
I see

2325
01:49:33,510 --> 01:49:34,780
And it's now been made into a DVD

2326
01:49:34,650 --> 01:49:37,700
So obviously for everyone it's a bit of thing of a past...

2327
01:49:38,230 --> 01:49:40,800
So it must be a bit hard to remember everything

2328
01:49:40,580 --> 01:49:42,220
That's true, it was 4, 5 years ago so...

2329
01:49:42,340 --> 01:49:43,360
Well, you know in the

2330
01:49:43,360 --> 01:49:44,590
very near future, you'll be taking partin a 48-hour endurance tag

2331
01:49:44,590 --> 01:49:45,960
very near future, you'll be taking part in a 48-hour endurance tag

2332
01:49:45,960 --> 01:49:47,430
very near future, you'll be taking part in a 48-hour endurance tag

2333
01:49:46,150 --> 01:49:47,140
Oh hell no!

2334
01:49:47,500 --> 01:49:48,470
No way in hell

2335
01:49:47,530 --> 01:49:48,650
I'm definitely not doing that

2336
01:49:48,490 --> 01:49:50,860
And that's why we need to refresh your memory...

2337
01:49:48,740 --> 01:49:49,280
We'll die..

2338
01:49:50,750 --> 01:49:51,440
No no no no

2339
01:49:51,810 --> 01:49:54,100
The people who watched it may have forgotten

2340
01:49:54,250 --> 01:49:54,970
But we remember everything

2341
01:49:54,650 --> 01:49:55,500
We really do

2342
01:49:55,360 --> 01:49:56,100
We do

2343
01:49:55,940 --> 01:49:57,260
Is it burned into your body?

2344
01:49:56,450 --> 01:49:58,490
Oh yes, definitely

2345
01:49:58,540 --> 01:49:59,380
Oh, really?

2346
01:49:59,440 --> 01:49:59,780
Yes

2347
01:50:00,360 --> 01:50:03,120
That is a Batsu Game I never want to do again

2348
01:50:03,210 --> 01:50:04,140
Out of everything I've done as part of my job, that was the toughest

2349
01:50:04,140 --> 01:50:04,910
Out of everything I've done as part of my job, that was the toughest

2350
01:50:04,910 --> 01:50:07,550
Out of everything I've done as part of my job, that was the toughest

2351
01:50:07,010 --> 01:50:07,910
Yeah seriously...

2352
01:50:07,020 --> 01:50:08,130
But seriously

2353
01:50:08,150 --> 01:50:08,950
Since all of you are saying it, it seems like it's true

2354
01:50:08,950 --> 01:50:09,620
Since all of you are saying it, it seems like it's true

2355
01:50:09,620 --> 01:50:10,250
Since all of you are saying it, it seems like it's true

2356
01:50:10,250 --> 01:50:12,490
Since all of you are saying it, it seems like it's true

2357
01:50:12,210 --> 01:50:13,900
Yeah, this really was

2358
01:50:13,380 --> 01:50:14,600
We are serious

2359
01:50:15,870 --> 01:50:18,920
Right? We genuinely did 24 hours in there...

2360
01:50:18,960 --> 01:50:19,440
Exactly

2361
01:50:19,070 --> 01:50:20,660
Yeah, you really did...

2362
01:50:20,370 --> 01:50:23,190
We really did and my God, it was tough

2363
01:50:22,110 --> 01:50:25,020
This was more mentally tough though, right?

2364
01:50:24,310 --> 01:50:25,510
Yeah, it was

2365
01:50:25,070 --> 01:50:28,730
Mentally and physically: it was a double whammy

2366
01:50:28,820 --> 01:50:32,780
24 hours straight on camera in itself feels like a punishment...

2367
01:50:32,360 --> 01:50:33,880
Yeah that's true

2368
01:50:33,340 --> 01:50:34,540
And you couldn't really sleep

2369
01:50:35,410 --> 01:50:37,320
I mean it says there "Sleep Time"

2370
01:50:36,640 --> 01:50:38,480
Ceiling Oni Slap (Yamasaki, Tanaka)

2371
01:50:36,640 --> 01:50:38,480
Sleep Time

2372
01:50:37,730 --> 01:50:38,870
But we um...

2373
01:50:39,290 --> 01:50:40,370
But we didn't get that much sleep...

2374
01:50:40,250 --> 01:50:40,780
Did you or not? God sakes...

2375
01:50:40,780 --> 01:50:42,080
Did you or not? God sakes...

2376
01:50:43,160 --> 01:50:44,420
We only got a bit of sleep

2377
01:50:43,680 --> 01:50:45,150
Right?

2378
01:50:45,170 --> 01:50:46,700
We only got a bit of sleep

2379
01:50:46,130 --> 01:50:47,180
I see

2380
01:50:48,740 --> 01:50:49,530
What is he on about?

2381
01:50:49,520 --> 01:50:50,420
Who's the guy next to Yama-chan?

2382
01:50:50,420 --> 01:50:52,360
Who's the guy next to Yama-chan?

2383
01:50:51,170 --> 01:50:51,480
Huh?

2384
01:50:51,540 --> 01:50:52,130
Oh wow...

2385
01:50:52,530 --> 01:50:53,030
Excuse me...

2386
01:50:54,700 --> 01:50:56,410
Come, gather around these boobs

2387
01:50:55,160 --> 01:50:57,760
Former Downtown manager

2388
01:50:55,160 --> 01:50:57,760
Fujiwara Hiroshi

2389
01:50:57,760 --> 01:51:00,900
He wasn't on it that much...

2390
01:50:59,860 --> 01:51:01,480
Yeah...

2391
01:51:03,490 --> 01:51:05,000
You were hardly on it..

2392
01:51:06,580 --> 01:51:08,600
That's right. So what's up, why are you here?

2393
01:51:08,830 --> 01:51:09,810
So umm... The 24 hour batsu game

2394
01:51:09,810 --> 01:51:13,340
So umm... The 24 hour batsu game

2395
01:51:13,770 --> 01:51:16,110
I worked hard during it too...

2396
01:51:15,580 --> 01:51:18,110
Your words just literally went...

2397
01:51:19,540 --> 01:51:20,980
I couldn't hear a word of what you were saying...

2398
01:51:21,110 --> 01:51:22,280
It didn't reach here...

2399
01:51:22,280 --> 01:51:23,780
It just rose up...

2400
01:51:24,770 --> 01:51:26,510
I couldn't hear at all...

2401
01:51:26,550 --> 01:51:27,100
Well anyway...

2402
01:51:27,160 --> 01:51:27,530
Right

2403
01:51:27,560 --> 01:51:29,930
When we talk about Batsu Games, we think of Fujiwara

2404
01:51:29,380 --> 01:51:30,000
That's true

2405
01:51:29,930 --> 01:51:30,340
Yup

2406
01:51:30,120 --> 01:51:30,860
That's true

2407
01:51:31,460 --> 01:51:32,900
And according to this board

2408
01:51:32,910 --> 01:51:35,850
This is how everything went apparently

2409
01:51:35,480 --> 01:51:36,640
I see, our schedule?

2410
01:51:36,640 --> 01:51:38,290
I don't remember it to this much detail...

2411
01:51:38,100 --> 01:51:38,880
I know

2412
01:51:38,510 --> 01:51:39,570
Wait a second...

2413
01:51:39,340 --> 01:51:40,610
How many years ago was this?

2414
01:51:40,820 --> 01:51:41,650
4 years ago

2415
01:51:41,710 --> 01:51:42,830
4 years

2416
01:51:42,440 --> 01:51:44,060
4 years...

2417
01:51:44,630 --> 01:51:47,290
Us 4 actually took part in it

2418
01:51:47,160 --> 01:51:47,890
Yeah

2419
01:51:48,370 --> 01:51:51,670
We've been asked to write who pissed you off the most

2420
01:51:52,150 --> 01:51:54,410
out of all the people there

2421
01:51:54,120 --> 01:51:54,840
Oh yeah

2422
01:51:54,430 --> 01:51:56,170
So, please write the answer, you too Yama-chan

2423
01:51:55,960 --> 01:51:56,560
Sure

2424
01:51:56,610 --> 01:51:57,390
But um...

2425
01:51:56,840 --> 01:51:59,390
There were so many...

2426
01:51:58,880 --> 01:51:59,610
Well obviously

2427
01:51:59,440 --> 01:52:00,930
All of them, really...

2428
01:52:01,010 --> 01:52:02,880
I watched it on air and all

2429
01:52:03,120 --> 01:52:06,100
And I did go to the shoot as well but I haven't seen all of it...

2430
01:52:05,790 --> 01:52:06,510
That's true

2431
01:52:06,730 --> 01:52:08,290
So umm... yeah

2432
01:52:08,290 --> 01:52:09,710
This is hard...

2433
01:52:09,730 --> 01:52:10,980
There are so many for me

2434
01:52:11,210 --> 01:52:12,400
For me too

2435
01:52:11,320 --> 01:52:12,400
Same

2436
01:52:14,010 --> 01:52:17,370
And Yamasaki was saying he hurt himself like really near the beginning...

2437
01:52:17,790 --> 01:52:19,280
Yeah, that's true

2438
01:52:18,280 --> 01:52:19,860
It was really soon after started

2439
01:52:19,670 --> 01:52:20,980
You cut your ear or something, right?

2440
01:52:21,150 --> 01:52:21,680
I had a huge cut on my ear

2441
01:52:21,680 --> 01:52:24,190
I had a huge cut on my ear

2442
01:52:22,850 --> 01:52:23,440
Oh shut up...

2443
01:52:24,950 --> 01:52:26,110
Seriously...

2444
01:52:26,430 --> 01:52:28,180
But in all seriousness, Yama-chan...

2445
01:52:29,080 --> 01:52:30,960
You've said it now so I'm going to bring this out

2446
01:52:30,980 --> 01:52:31,330
Yeah...

2447
01:52:31,160 --> 01:52:31,600
Yeah

2448
01:52:32,470 --> 01:52:33,950
Lies that Yama-chan made

2449
01:52:34,300 --> 01:52:35,950
Oh yeah

2450
01:52:34,510 --> 01:52:36,040
Wait, what do you mean lies?

2451
01:52:36,450 --> 01:52:36,770
Right?

2452
01:52:36,770 --> 01:52:37,110
Yes

2453
01:52:37,150 --> 01:52:38,230
There are this many?

2454
01:52:38,290 --> 01:52:39,260
Yeah, first off

2455
01:52:39,130 --> 01:52:43,470
20 minutes in: My rib bone is broken!!

2456
01:52:39,910 --> 01:52:42,770
20 minutes in, he said his rib bone was broken

2457
01:52:42,410 --> 01:52:43,620
He did

2458
01:52:43,260 --> 01:52:44,130
He did say that

2459
01:52:45,540 --> 01:52:47,440
It would have been great if your rib bone had not broken though, huh?

2460
01:52:46,030 --> 01:52:46,690
He did say that

2461
01:52:46,870 --> 01:52:47,520
Right?

2462
01:52:47,440 --> 01:52:48,480
It would have been great if your rib bone had not broken though, huh?

2463
01:52:48,480 --> 01:52:52,110
It would have been great if your rib bone had not broken though, huh?

2464
01:52:50,690 --> 01:52:51,290
Wait...

2465
01:52:52,010 --> 01:52:53,770
It broke, so I can't help that

2466
01:52:54,450 --> 01:52:55,630
And the next one,

2467
01:52:55,990 --> 01:53:00,120
90 minutes in:  My ear is cut!!

2468
01:52:56,800 --> 01:52:59,340
90 minutes in, he said his ear was cut

2469
01:52:59,570 --> 01:53:00,650
I remember that

2470
01:53:00,270 --> 01:53:01,510
I do remember that as well

2471
01:53:01,520 --> 01:53:02,140
He did, right?

2472
01:53:01,730 --> 01:53:02,840
He did

2473
01:53:02,700 --> 01:53:03,340
Of course I was

2474
01:53:03,090 --> 01:53:05,420
That's amazing, his rib broke

2475
01:53:05,990 --> 01:53:08,510
and 90 minutes later, now his ear is cut

2476
01:53:08,390 --> 01:53:09,420
I told them all

2477
01:53:09,550 --> 01:53:10,770
from the paper fan

2478
01:53:11,200 --> 01:53:12,510
That's amazing

2479
01:53:12,530 --> 01:53:14,200
Yeah, that was awful

2480
01:53:13,770 --> 01:53:14,400
But by this point, your rib had already healed?

2481
01:53:14,400 --> 01:53:15,710
But by this point, your rib had already healed?

2482
01:53:15,710 --> 01:53:17,740
Yes it had.

2483
01:53:17,710 --> 01:53:18,620
It was broken though!

2484
01:53:19,320 --> 01:53:20,410
You said it was broken!

2485
01:53:20,410 --> 01:53:21,640
No but seriously

2486
01:53:21,050 --> 01:53:22,940
It doesn't heal that quickly...

2487
01:53:22,330 --> 01:53:24,640
No but my ear was in so much pain

2488
01:53:25,420 --> 01:53:29,620
14 hours 15 minutes in: My rashes have broken out!!

2489
01:53:25,760 --> 01:53:27,790
14 hours 15 minutes in...

2490
01:53:27,850 --> 01:53:28,380
Right

2491
01:53:28,430 --> 01:53:29,890
He said his rashes had broken out

2492
01:53:30,320 --> 01:53:31,280
I mean yeah

2493
01:53:31,160 --> 01:53:32,720
Was this more because of the mental side?

2494
01:53:32,740 --> 01:53:35,550
Yeah, I mean you guys even were a bit freaked out

2495
01:53:35,750 --> 01:53:37,130
There was some stuff on his skin...

2496
01:53:36,730 --> 01:53:38,390
Like there were so many rashes

2497
01:53:38,410 --> 01:53:39,330
I don't remember that

2498
01:53:39,350 --> 01:53:40,230
I don't remember

2499
01:53:39,900 --> 01:53:40,810
It wasn't that bad

2500
01:53:40,810 --> 01:53:41,280
Yeah

2501
01:53:41,330 --> 01:53:42,730
And when your rashes broke out,  how was your ear?

2502
01:53:42,730 --> 01:53:43,970
And when your rashes broke out, how was your ear?

2503
01:53:43,970 --> 01:53:46,070
Oh yeah, it was fine!

2504
01:53:46,360 --> 01:53:47,330
Amazing...

2505
01:53:48,810 --> 01:53:52,180
And lastly, 14 hours 30 minutes in, he said he a fever.

2506
01:53:49,740 --> 01:53:53,740
14 hours 30 minutes  I have a fever!!

2507
01:53:53,910 --> 01:53:54,810
He said he had a fever and therefore, wants to go home

2508
01:53:54,810 --> 01:53:58,050
He said he had a fever and therefore, wants to go ho home

2509
01:53:58,180 --> 01:54:03,050
24 hour tag

2510
01:53:58,180 --> 01:54:03,050
Yamasaki's 4 lies

2511
01:54:03,050 --> 01:54:06,060
20 minutes

2512
01:54:03,050 --> 01:54:06,060
Since the start:

2513
01:54:10,620 --> 01:54:12,850
Are you serious right now?

2514
01:54:12,990 --> 01:54:14,450
No, I'm serious

2515
01:54:14,920 --> 01:54:16,190
It's definitely a lie

2516
01:54:15,770 --> 01:54:16,480
Are you serious?

2517
01:54:16,300 --> 01:54:18,490
You've lied in the past about your rib being broken...

2518
01:54:18,570 --> 01:54:19,210
That's true

2519
01:54:19,230 --> 01:54:19,650
No no

2520
01:54:20,070 --> 01:54:21,040
But it's definitely

2521
01:54:21,170 --> 01:54:22,170
It's not broken but it's fractured

2522
01:54:22,170 --> 01:54:24,610
It's not broken but it's fractured

2523
01:54:23,150 --> 01:54:23,500
No way...

2524
01:54:23,520 --> 01:54:24,460
From before?

2525
01:54:24,870 --> 01:54:26,000
Just from before?

2526
01:54:26,470 --> 01:54:27,420
You fell over, right?

2527
01:54:28,120 --> 01:54:29,670
You got a fracture from that?

2528
01:54:29,550 --> 01:54:30,830
There's no way in hell...

2529
01:54:30,740 --> 01:54:32,970
No but I'm like that, seriously

2530
01:54:33,900 --> 01:54:35,620
No way it's broken

2531
01:54:35,750 --> 01:54:36,130
No no

2532
01:54:36,290 --> 01:54:37,620
It's not broken, it's fractured

2533
01:54:37,620 --> 01:54:39,420
It's not broken, it's fractured

2534
01:54:39,240 --> 01:54:40,660
Seriously

2535
01:54:40,690 --> 01:54:43,900
You're really pushing the fact it's a fracture, huh?

2536
01:54:42,000 --> 01:54:42,450
Yeah...

2537
01:54:44,200 --> 01:54:54,640
Thai Kick

2538
01:54:44,200 --> 01:54:54,640
The footage in question

2539
01:54:44,870 --> 01:54:48,990
This is the footage where Yamasaki claims to have broken his rib

2540
01:54:50,150 --> 01:54:52,670
Watch Yamasaki on the right

2541
01:54:58,670 --> 01:55:00,390
Being chased, he falls, and in this moment...

2542
01:55:00,390 --> 01:55:02,180
Being chased, he falls  and in this moment...

2543
01:55:02,180 --> 01:55:03,400
Being chased, he falls and in this moment...

2544
01:55:03,110 --> 01:55:08,720
His rib bone

2545
01:55:03,110 --> 01:55:08,720
supposedly broke here...

2546
01:55:04,110 --> 01:55:05,490
Yamasaki's rib bone

2547
01:55:06,240 --> 01:55:07,700
broke here apparently...

2548
01:55:08,920 --> 01:55:11,920
1 hour 30 minutes

2549
01:55:08,920 --> 01:55:11,920
Since the start

2550
01:55:14,060 --> 01:55:14,690
Damn, my ear hurts

2551
01:55:14,690 --> 01:55:15,690
Damn, my ear hurts

2552
01:55:15,690 --> 01:55:17,200
It's cut...

2553
01:55:16,520 --> 01:55:17,080
Is it?

2554
01:55:17,130 --> 01:55:17,960
Yes, there's a big cut

2555
01:55:18,080 --> 01:55:18,630
There is, right?

2556
01:55:18,630 --> 01:55:18,950
Yes

2557
01:55:18,960 --> 01:55:21,200
What? Has it been there for a while?

2558
01:55:20,810 --> 01:55:21,970
Yes, it has

2559
01:55:21,480 --> 01:55:22,100
From just before?

2560
01:55:22,220 --> 01:55:23,390
Yes it i-.... Ow ow ow

2561
01:55:23,760 --> 01:55:24,970
Oh don't lie, man...

2562
01:55:24,560 --> 01:55:24,990
No...

2563
01:55:25,880 --> 01:55:26,730
Wow...

2564
01:55:25,920 --> 01:55:26,890
You won't forget about that injury, will you..?

2565
01:55:27,850 --> 01:55:28,960
No, seriously

2566
01:55:29,600 --> 01:55:30,320
Is it cut?

2567
01:55:30,350 --> 01:55:30,720
Yes

2568
01:55:31,670 --> 01:55:32,270
It is

2569
01:55:32,180 --> 01:55:34,580
Oh shit! That's a cut and a half!

2570
01:55:33,500 --> 01:55:34,290
Was that from before?

2571
01:55:34,340 --> 01:55:34,900
Yeah, it was

2572
01:55:34,930 --> 01:55:36,170
Wow, how though?

2573
01:55:35,910 --> 01:55:36,490
Damn, that would

2574
01:55:36,430 --> 01:55:36,930
From the paper fan

2575
01:55:36,970 --> 01:55:39,010
Hey man... That would hurt...

2576
01:55:39,120 --> 01:55:39,840
It would, right?

2577
01:55:40,100 --> 01:55:41,040
It's about this big...

2578
01:55:41,230 --> 01:55:41,670
No way!

2579
01:55:41,820 --> 01:55:43,020
It's a bit swollen too

2580
01:55:42,070 --> 01:55:43,210
Damn, that would hurt

2581
01:55:43,210 --> 01:55:44,470
Damn, that would hurt

2582
01:55:45,220 --> 01:55:46,570
Someone, please come

2583
01:55:48,490 --> 01:55:59,040
Paper fan

2584
01:55:48,490 --> 01:55:59,040
The footage in question

2585
01:55:48,760 --> 01:55:52,420
This is the footage Yamasaki claims where his ear got a cut.

2586
01:55:54,500 --> 01:55:57,300
Watch Yamasaki as he gets hit hard by the paper fan

2587
01:56:02,630 --> 01:56:06,870
The moment the fan hits Yamasaki right here...

2588
01:56:06,680 --> 01:56:12,290
Apparently his ear

2589
01:56:06,680 --> 01:56:12,290
got cut

2590
01:56:07,460 --> 01:56:09,870
Yamasaki apparently got a cut on his ear

2591
01:56:10,420 --> 01:56:11,680
Fair enough... It looks painful...

2592
01:56:12,490 --> 01:56:15,490
14 hours 15 minutes

2593
01:56:12,490 --> 01:56:15,490
From the start:

2594
01:56:16,020 --> 01:56:23,760
Footage in question

2595
01:56:16,020 --> 01:56:23,760
Pitching machine

2596
01:56:16,250 --> 01:56:18,370
First, please check this footage out

2597
01:56:18,940 --> 01:56:21,860
This is the batsu Tanaka received, pitching machine

2598
01:56:22,750 --> 01:56:25,060
Yamasaki, who saw this horrible punishment

2599
01:56:25,430 --> 01:56:30,040
Comes up with a

2600
01:56:25,430 --> 01:56:30,040
ridiculous lie

2601
01:56:26,150 --> 01:56:27,530
After this, comes up with a ridiculous lie

2602
01:56:27,530 --> 01:56:28,610
After this, comes up with a ridiculous lie

2603
01:56:28,610 --> 01:56:29,480
After this, comes up with a ridiculous lie

2604
01:56:32,240 --> 01:56:33,240
That must have hurt like hell...

2605
01:56:33,240 --> 01:56:34,000
Of course...

2606
01:56:35,810 --> 01:56:36,810
That hurts so bad...

2607
01:56:49,160 --> 01:56:51,530
Oh man, my rashes are breaking out

2608
01:56:50,240 --> 01:56:50,700
Really?..

2609
01:56:52,960 --> 01:56:54,760
You keep banging on about your rib bone being broken and now your rashes are breaking out

2610
01:56:54,760 --> 01:56:57,560
You keep benging on about your rib bone being broken and now your rashes are breaking out

2611
01:56:56,320 --> 01:56:57,100
Really?

2612
01:56:58,800 --> 01:57:00,570
There's nothing there...

2613
01:57:00,570 --> 01:57:02,440
No, nothing there

2614
01:57:05,140 --> 01:57:07,040
I'm itchy though...

2615
01:57:07,040 --> 01:57:10,040
14 hours 30 minutes

2616
01:57:07,040 --> 01:57:10,040
From the start:

2617
01:57:10,410 --> 01:57:18,220
Footage in question

2618
01:57:10,410 --> 01:57:18,220
Wonton noodles

2619
01:57:10,720 --> 01:57:11,820
This is the final one

2620
01:57:12,260 --> 01:57:14,520
Endo is getting Wonton noodles poured on him

2621
01:57:15,160 --> 01:57:16,890
Yamasaki sees the pain

2622
01:57:17,090 --> 01:57:19,450
on Endo's face and

2623
01:57:20,090 --> 01:57:25,190
Comes up with

2624
01:57:20,090 --> 01:57:25,190
shocking statement

2625
01:57:20,650 --> 01:57:21,930
After this, comes up with a shocking statement

2626
01:57:21,930 --> 01:57:24,160
After this, comes up with a shocking statement

2627
01:57:27,020 --> 01:57:27,590
What's wrong

2628
01:57:29,430 --> 01:57:31,270
What's wrong now?

2629
01:57:31,600 --> 01:57:34,170
I have a fever

2630
01:57:32,480 --> 01:57:33,210
You have a fever?

2631
01:57:34,680 --> 01:57:35,390
You have a fever?

2632
01:57:38,240 --> 01:57:39,940
So you broke your rib bone, your rashes broke out, you cut your ear and now you have a fever

2633
01:57:39,940 --> 01:57:41,710
So you broke your rib bone, your rashes broke out, you cut your ear and now you have a fever

2634
01:57:41,710 --> 01:57:42,980
So you broke your rib bone, your rashes broke out, you cut your ear and now you have a fever

2635
01:57:42,980 --> 01:57:45,350
So you broke your rib bone, your rashes broke out, you cut your ear and now you have a fever

2636
01:57:47,220 --> 01:57:49,280
Your ear is cut but that's it, right?

2637
01:57:50,080 --> 01:57:50,820
Seriously...

2638
01:57:52,060 --> 01:57:52,610
But

2639
01:57:52,610 --> 01:57:52,950
Yeah..

2640
01:57:52,960 --> 01:57:54,270
What Yamasaki was saying was to me was

2641
01:57:55,420 --> 01:57:57,780
"Hamada was trying too hard"

2642
01:57:57,970 --> 01:57:58,360
Yes...

2643
01:57:58,500 --> 01:57:59,710
What?

2644
01:57:58,610 --> 01:57:59,070
No...

2645
01:57:59,450 --> 01:58:00,980
So like honestly...

2646
01:58:01,160 --> 01:58:03,800
I thought Hamada-san would snap at around the 8 hour mark

2647
01:58:04,110 --> 01:58:05,220
gather all the staff

2648
01:58:05,630 --> 01:58:07,840
and say something like "Let's stop here"

2649
01:58:07,130 --> 01:58:08,280
But that's not doing it properly!

2650
01:58:09,010 --> 01:58:10,040
You were thinking "Why is he actually doing it?"

2651
01:58:10,720 --> 01:58:11,730
So because we have good enough footage...

2652
01:58:11,510 --> 01:58:12,730
Yeah exactly...

2653
01:58:12,150 --> 01:58:14,060
So like what's the point of doing 24 hours

2654
01:58:12,660 --> 01:58:14,330
So just get enough footage

2655
01:58:14,700 --> 01:58:15,670
Exactly

2656
01:58:16,330 --> 01:58:18,300
That's what I was expecting to happen

2657
01:58:19,280 --> 01:58:22,280
But you actually did the whole 24 hours

2658
01:58:21,870 --> 01:58:22,960
Yeah, he's weird like that

2659
01:58:22,140 --> 01:58:22,840
Amazing

2660
01:58:23,350 --> 01:58:24,020
I was getting pissed off thinking "Come on, say it!"

2661
01:58:24,020 --> 01:58:25,950
I was getting pissed off thinking "Come on, say it!"

2662
01:58:25,380 --> 01:58:26,290
But I guess that is true

2663
01:58:26,700 --> 01:58:28,280
Like "We are here because of you!"

2664
01:58:30,020 --> 01:58:30,940
You guys thought that too though, right?

2665
01:58:30,730 --> 01:58:32,420
Yeah I really did, too

2666
01:58:31,830 --> 01:58:32,980
No way!

2667
01:58:33,120 --> 01:58:34,690
I was thinking like "When are we going to finish?"

2668
01:58:34,490 --> 01:58:36,320
No no no.

2669
01:58:35,180 --> 01:58:36,100
I thought that too

2670
01:58:36,630 --> 01:58:37,270
In my heart I was thinking "Snap, snap, snap, snap, snap!"

2671
01:58:37,270 --> 01:58:37,600
In my heart I was thinking "Snap, snap, snap, snap, snap!"

2672
01:58:37,600 --> 01:58:37,870
In my heart I was thinking "Snap, snap, snap, snap, snap!"

2673
01:58:37,870 --> 01:58:38,130
In my heart I was thinking "Snap, snap, snap, snap, snap!"

2674
01:58:38,130 --> 01:58:40,170
In my heart I was thinking "Snap, snap, snap, snap, snap!"

2675
01:58:39,700 --> 01:58:40,400
"Please get angry!"

2676
01:58:40,430 --> 01:58:41,240
"Please just snap!"

2677
01:58:41,240 --> 01:58:43,440
I was hoping one of the staff would screw up and set you off

2678
01:58:44,110 --> 01:58:45,300
I see

2679
01:58:44,360 --> 01:58:46,330
That's how tough it was

2680
01:58:46,800 --> 01:58:49,340
Yeah, it really was like that tough

2681
01:58:49,010 --> 01:58:50,250
Yes, exactly

2682
01:58:49,190 --> 01:58:50,320
Yeah

2683
01:58:51,190 --> 01:58:52,700
Oh, really?

2684
01:58:51,740 --> 01:58:54,620
Yeah, he's weird, he doesn't snap in times like that

2685
01:58:55,160 --> 01:58:56,020
What?

2686
01:58:55,760 --> 01:58:56,980
I don't get it either.

2687
01:58:57,310 --> 01:58:58,900
He's really professional in those situations for some reason...

2688
01:58:59,490 --> 01:59:00,630
Like at the Kouhaku...

2689
01:59:01,860 --> 01:59:03,580
Well they did loads of stuff to us

2690
01:59:04,070 --> 01:59:04,810
So Tanaka

2691
01:59:04,990 --> 01:59:05,320
Yes

2692
01:59:05,380 --> 01:59:06,690
Who was the most annoying character?

2693
01:59:06,480 --> 01:59:08,250
For me, there were 2

2694
01:59:08,730 --> 01:59:09,600
who really annoyed me

2695
01:59:09,700 --> 01:59:10,120
Really?

2696
01:59:10,150 --> 01:59:10,980
So I wrote both of them down

2697
01:59:11,130 --> 01:59:11,470
Who?

2698
01:59:11,520 --> 01:59:13,430
The ladle

2699
01:59:11,630 --> 01:59:15,510
Ladle (underneath); volleyball

2700
01:59:14,150 --> 01:59:15,450
and the volleyball machine

2701
01:59:14,900 --> 01:59:15,570
The ladle...

2702
01:59:16,130 --> 01:59:16,760
The ladle...

2703
01:59:16,360 --> 01:59:17,350
The ladle...

2704
01:59:17,940 --> 01:59:19,740
Wasn't that ladle guy really annoying?

2705
01:59:20,350 --> 01:59:22,350
The feeling of getting hit by that?

2706
01:59:23,600 --> 01:59:25,160
Like the fact you have to run from that

2707
01:59:26,020 --> 01:59:28,280
The ladle really hurts as well!

2708
01:59:28,050 --> 01:59:29,300
And the guy was really fast

2709
01:59:29,100 --> 01:59:29,550
Exactly

2710
01:59:29,550 --> 01:59:30,100
Yeah

2711
01:59:29,750 --> 01:59:30,490
The ladle guy

2712
01:59:30,630 --> 01:59:33,040
It's not that flashy like other batsus but

2713
01:59:33,410 --> 01:59:35,780
these ones hurt more usually...

2714
01:59:35,910 --> 01:59:37,180
because it's just literally like that...

2715
01:59:36,570 --> 01:59:38,830
Exactly. This really hurt

2716
01:59:38,420 --> 01:59:39,150
It did

2717
01:59:39,450 --> 01:59:40,010
It really did

2718
01:59:40,050 --> 01:59:41,110
And they did it so many times

2719
01:59:40,880 --> 01:59:42,110
Yeah, they did

2720
01:59:42,580 --> 01:59:45,450
And the other one... The volleyball machine

2721
01:59:44,020 --> 01:59:44,840
Oh yeah

2722
01:59:46,470 --> 01:59:46,970
They were like aiming for my face

2723
01:59:46,970 --> 01:59:49,270
They were like aiming for my face

2724
01:59:49,150 --> 01:59:50,090
I was just glued to a wall

2725
01:59:50,680 --> 01:59:52,320
and it hurt so much

2726
01:59:51,990 --> 01:59:53,360
That would hurt

2727
01:59:53,380 --> 01:59:55,140
I couldn't even give a good reaction...

2728
01:59:55,330 --> 01:59:56,400
Well yeah...

2729
01:59:56,740 --> 01:59:57,340
It was just so painful

2730
01:59:58,270 --> 01:59:58,790
Seriously

2731
01:59:59,820 --> 02:00:03,690
Tanaka Naoki

2732
01:59:59,820 --> 02:00:03,690
The character who pissed him off most

2733
02:00:03,690 --> 02:00:06,690
Ladle

2734
02:00:07,060 --> 02:00:12,260
5 minutes from the start

2735
02:00:07,060 --> 02:00:12,260
8:05 AM

2736
02:00:08,540 --> 02:00:09,750
Damn, there's loads of them

2737
02:00:09,980 --> 02:00:10,810
Hamada-san!

2738
02:00:11,220 --> 02:00:12,090
Oh crap!

2739
02:00:16,840 --> 02:00:17,370
Oh man

2740
02:00:17,850 --> 02:00:18,910
This is so tough

2741
02:00:22,650 --> 02:00:23,270
Wait, no!

2742
02:00:30,520 --> 02:00:37,020
21 hours 35 minutes from the start

2743
02:00:30,520 --> 02:00:37,020
5:35 AM

2744
02:00:52,270 --> 02:00:55,270
Machine

2745
02:00:52,270 --> 02:00:55,270
Volleyball

2746
02:00:55,640 --> 02:01:04,650
18 hours since the start

2747
02:00:55,640 --> 02:01:04,650
2 AM

2748
02:00:59,710 --> 02:01:00,460
Amazing

2749
02:01:10,020 --> 02:01:10,850
That is amazing

2750
02:01:11,400 --> 02:01:12,410
What happened?

2751
02:01:13,560 --> 02:01:14,070
Seriously?

2752
02:01:16,140 --> 02:01:17,340
This one

2753
02:01:18,050 --> 02:01:18,680
Holy shit

2754
02:01:19,880 --> 02:01:21,670
This is really tough

2755
02:01:21,770 --> 02:01:22,900
Poor you...

2756
02:01:25,750 --> 02:01:27,330
And they were doing it from point blank

2757
02:01:27,330 --> 02:01:28,150
And they were doing it from point blank

2758
02:01:27,870 --> 02:01:28,800
Yeah!!

2759
02:01:30,740 --> 02:01:31,410
2 of them hit him right in the face

2760
02:01:31,410 --> 02:01:33,610
2 of them hit him right in the face

2761
02:01:34,150 --> 02:01:35,180
Ow...

2762
02:01:35,450 --> 02:01:36,150
How about Endo?

2763
02:01:36,110 --> 02:01:36,400
Yes...

2764
02:01:36,720 --> 02:01:41,040
For me, the punishment like the ones Tanaka got

2765
02:01:41,240 --> 02:01:43,240
were bad as well but

2766
02:01:43,690 --> 02:01:45,940
but this was really tough

2767
02:01:45,860 --> 02:01:48,760
Heipo

2768
02:01:46,590 --> 02:01:48,680
Heipo

2769
02:01:48,100 --> 02:01:48,680
I see

2770
02:01:48,790 --> 02:01:50,260
Oh yeah

2771
02:01:50,590 --> 02:01:52,480
He comes in from time to time

2772
02:01:52,750 --> 02:01:54,970
It says on the board "Heipo: Failure"

2773
02:01:55,130 --> 02:01:57,640
Hanging Ten-don (Tempura-don) (Hamada)

2774
02:01:55,130 --> 02:01:57,640
Heipo: Pie (Failure)

2775
02:01:55,130 --> 02:01:57,640
Ladle (Yamasaki)

2776
02:01:55,130 --> 02:01:57,640
Open palm strike (fail)

2777
02:01:55,350 --> 02:01:56,530
He was like a failure on all of them

2778
02:01:55,440 --> 02:01:56,000
Yeah

2779
02:01:56,500 --> 02:01:59,970
But this would really piss me off

2780
02:01:59,780 --> 02:02:02,270
When we're like properly down

2781
02:02:02,980 --> 02:02:04,640
and we're like "What are you doing to us man?"

2782
02:02:04,130 --> 02:02:06,040
Exactly, like "What do you want?"

2783
02:02:05,510 --> 02:02:07,380
Like, "no one gives a shit about you"

2784
02:02:08,620 --> 02:02:09,380
He's really greedy like that, right?

2785
02:02:09,380 --> 02:02:10,880
He's really greedy like that, right?

2786
02:02:11,050 --> 02:02:14,890
Character who pissed him off the most

2787
02:02:11,050 --> 02:02:14,890
Endo Shozo

2788
02:02:14,890 --> 02:02:17,890
Heipo

2789
02:02:18,260 --> 02:02:23,930
3 PM

2790
02:02:18,260 --> 02:02:23,930
7 hours from the start

2791
02:02:29,460 --> 02:02:30,300
What the hell is with this guy?

2792
02:02:30,450 --> 02:02:31,330
Oh, it's Heipo!

2793
02:02:31,260 --> 02:02:32,530
What the hell are you doing?

2794
02:02:32,000 --> 02:02:32,780
What is this?

2795
02:02:32,800 --> 02:02:33,640
Hold on a minute

2796
02:02:33,340 --> 02:02:33,970
NO!

2797
02:02:34,050 --> 02:02:34,880
We can win this!

2798
02:02:34,400 --> 02:02:35,410
No, no, no

2799
02:02:34,800 --> 02:02:35,790
Go back!

2800
02:02:36,020 --> 02:02:36,700
We can win!

2801
02:02:36,400 --> 02:02:37,160
No, please

2802
02:02:37,590 --> 02:02:38,250
Oh no!

2803
02:02:38,500 --> 02:02:39,290
What the hell are you doing!

2804
02:02:41,810 --> 02:02:43,370
Go home!

2805
02:02:43,970 --> 02:02:45,080
He's the worst

2806
02:02:45,550 --> 02:02:46,640
What a failure

2807
02:02:46,610 --> 02:02:48,220
He dropped it all as he came out

2808
02:02:49,260 --> 02:02:54,660
4 PM

2809
02:02:49,260 --> 02:02:54,660
8 hours since the start

2810
02:02:56,000 --> 02:02:57,220
This guy!

2811
02:02:57,940 --> 02:02:58,990
He's so annoying

2812
02:03:02,050 --> 02:03:03,370
Amazing

2813
02:03:05,290 --> 02:03:05,890
Go back!

2814
02:03:05,560 --> 02:03:06,630
You can't fall like him

2815
02:03:06,630 --> 02:03:07,940
That fall was...

2816
02:03:08,520 --> 02:03:10,140
just amazing

2817
02:03:10,660 --> 02:03:11,250
What is he doing?

2818
02:03:11,160 --> 02:03:11,770
God...

2819
02:03:13,870 --> 02:03:14,910
He's the worst

2820
02:03:14,450 --> 02:03:15,660
He can't walk

2821
02:03:16,030 --> 02:03:17,760
God he's so annoying

2822
02:03:17,760 --> 02:03:18,420
Go back!

2823
02:03:19,750 --> 02:03:23,790
23 hours 53 minutes since the start      (PLEASE RE-TYPESET)

2824
02:03:19,750 --> 02:03:23,790
7:53 AM

2825
02:03:25,820 --> 02:03:28,970
Like, he just doesn't learn

2826
02:03:27,440 --> 02:03:28,110
He really doesn't

2827
02:03:31,680 --> 02:03:33,140
This is the ladle

2828
02:03:32,820 --> 02:03:34,180
Oh right, he wanted to hit you

2829
02:03:35,300 --> 02:03:36,770
But he's just not got it

2830
02:03:43,200 --> 02:03:44,330
I mean this even...

2831
02:03:47,480 --> 02:03:50,740
At a point when we were all pissed off...

2832
02:03:51,330 --> 02:03:52,520
Of course you'll get done

2833
02:03:53,430 --> 02:03:55,910
This takes stamina though, doesn't it?

2834
02:03:56,160 --> 02:04:00,600
11 hours from the start

2835
02:03:56,160 --> 02:04:00,600
7 PM

2836
02:03:59,330 --> 02:04:00,800
Oh, it's just Heipo

2837
02:04:00,800 --> 02:04:01,440
This time!

2838
02:04:02,730 --> 02:04:03,770
He said, "This time!"

2839
02:04:06,660 --> 02:04:07,750
Amazing

2840
02:04:08,210 --> 02:04:09,430
Why is he telling us!?

2841
02:04:13,390 --> 02:04:14,200
Oh man

2842
02:04:14,870 --> 02:04:15,540
He's in a state of shock

2843
02:04:16,240 --> 02:04:17,270
This is ridiculous

2844
02:04:18,290 --> 02:04:19,970
He smacked his head

2845
02:04:24,000 --> 02:04:25,270
I thought he might have hurt himself

2846
02:04:28,890 --> 02:04:29,570
I do get you

2847
02:04:28,890 --> 02:04:30,680
Yeah

2848
02:04:29,890 --> 02:04:31,090
I do get you

2849
02:04:30,160 --> 02:04:31,350
That would piss anyone off

2850
02:04:31,380 --> 02:04:32,310
It does, right?

2851
02:04:32,700 --> 02:04:35,630
And he has a total different effect to everyone else, right?

2852
02:04:35,830 --> 02:04:36,670
Yeah

2853
02:04:36,700 --> 02:04:38,810
In the haunted hotel I did...

2854
02:04:39,130 --> 02:04:40,380
He was saying "I'm scared, I'm scared"

2855
02:04:40,590 --> 02:04:42,310
And I'm thinking "You've got nothing to do with this"...

2856
02:04:42,980 --> 02:04:47,460
I'd be over here doing something and I could here far off him saying "I'm scared"...

2857
02:04:48,440 --> 02:04:50,220
It just really pisses you off

2858
02:04:50,060 --> 02:04:51,800
It really does

2859
02:04:50,590 --> 02:04:51,760
Yeah

2860
02:04:52,510 --> 02:04:53,360
How about you, Yama-chan?

2861
02:04:53,410 --> 02:04:55,740
For me, it was the open palm strike

2862
02:04:55,020 --> 02:04:57,550
Open palm strike (underneath): The soldiers of the night

2863
02:04:56,680 --> 02:04:57,970
Oh yeah

2864
02:04:57,230 --> 02:04:57,960
The open palm strike...

2865
02:04:57,800 --> 02:04:58,700
The fat guy, right?

2866
02:04:58,700 --> 02:04:59,520
Yeah

2867
02:04:58,730 --> 02:05:01,890
No, I mean him as well but for me, Okamoto's slap

2868
02:05:03,930 --> 02:05:05,950
He came out during the 24 hours

2869
02:05:04,330 --> 02:05:05,310
Oh yeah

2870
02:05:06,630 --> 02:05:07,680
I forgot about that

2871
02:05:07,340 --> 02:05:09,120
His slap was really

2872
02:05:08,590 --> 02:05:09,520
I mean

2873
02:05:09,720 --> 02:05:10,290
Yama...

2874
02:05:09,760 --> 02:05:11,680
It was so bad, wasn't it?

2875
02:05:11,520 --> 02:05:12,270
Yeah it was

2876
02:05:12,380 --> 02:05:14,160
Yamasaki and Okamoto since the old days...

2877
02:05:14,240 --> 02:05:14,760
Right?

2878
02:05:14,440 --> 02:05:16,900
Like you got into shit at the airport with him and all...

2879
02:05:16,640 --> 02:05:17,270
Yeah

2880
02:05:18,710 --> 02:05:19,540
He smacks you  off camera even

2881
02:05:19,540 --> 02:05:21,540
He smacks you off camera even

2882
02:05:20,550 --> 02:05:22,630
I know, he smacked me so hard off camera...

2883
02:05:21,420 --> 02:05:22,090
Wow

2884
02:05:23,300 --> 02:05:24,680
I was like "What the hell are you doing, man!?"

2885
02:05:25,850 --> 02:05:26,640
That was tough

2886
02:05:26,590 --> 02:05:27,870
And the other one?

2887
02:05:27,400 --> 02:05:30,030
The soldiers during the night, I wonder if you remember...

2888
02:05:30,200 --> 02:05:31,320
When we were sleeping

2889
02:05:31,780 --> 02:05:33,340
That rope came down

2890
02:05:33,050 --> 02:05:34,220
From above, right?

2891
02:05:33,830 --> 02:05:34,930
Yeah, I do

2892
02:05:35,140 --> 02:05:37,150
That was just so scary

2893
02:05:36,700 --> 02:05:37,990
Yeah, that was scary

2894
02:05:38,050 --> 02:05:39,810
If there was a kid there, he would cry

2895
02:05:39,840 --> 02:05:40,510
Right?

2896
02:05:41,870 --> 02:05:45,700
Character who pissed him off most

2897
02:05:41,870 --> 02:05:45,700
Yamasaki Hosei

2898
02:05:45,700 --> 02:05:48,710
Okamoto slap

2899
02:05:49,810 --> 02:05:55,410
13 hours 45 minutes from the start

2900
02:05:49,810 --> 02:05:55,410
9:45 PM

2901
02:05:51,580 --> 02:05:53,430
YAMASAKI!

2902
02:05:53,130 --> 02:05:54,240
What the hell, what the hell!

2903
02:05:56,420 --> 02:05:57,950
YAMASAKI!

2904
02:06:04,400 --> 02:06:07,250
He said Yamasaki; stop, man!

2905
02:06:06,370 --> 02:06:07,950
Just please hurry up and get caught!

2906
02:06:07,530 --> 02:06:08,300
He's got him!

2907
02:06:08,600 --> 02:06:09,880
Oh no!

2908
02:06:20,370 --> 02:06:22,170
His precious cat just...

2909
02:06:22,870 --> 02:06:24,120
It ran away straight away...

2910
02:06:24,380 --> 02:06:24,970
Hello

2911
02:06:24,840 --> 02:06:26,950
Great job, guys

2912
02:06:25,910 --> 02:06:26,750
Oh, thank you very much

2913
02:06:26,950 --> 02:06:29,950
The soldiers of the night

2914
02:06:30,320 --> 02:06:35,020
18 hours 30 minutes from the start

2915
02:06:30,320 --> 02:06:35,020
2:30 AM

2916
02:06:31,370 --> 02:06:32,640
Oh yeah, I found the rope here...

2917
02:06:36,790 --> 02:06:40,090
Rope

2918
02:06:38,360 --> 02:06:40,150
It was hard to see it because it's so dark...

2919
02:06:48,140 --> 02:06:49,810
You really look a weak animal

2920
02:06:50,890 --> 02:06:52,180
Like a really weak animal

2921
02:06:55,020 --> 02:06:55,820
You do...

2922
02:06:56,460 --> 02:06:57,730
Like a chimpanzee

2923
02:06:56,840 --> 02:06:57,740
Something's hanging down

2924
02:07:16,400 --> 02:07:17,660
I had no idea

2925
02:07:18,750 --> 02:07:20,210
We couldn't run away

2926
02:07:20,570 --> 02:07:21,610
What the hell...

2927
02:07:21,970 --> 02:07:22,710
What the hell!

2928
02:07:23,020 --> 02:07:24,740
What the hell, man!

2929
02:07:31,440 --> 02:07:33,810
He punched me in the face!

2930
02:07:32,710 --> 02:07:33,370
For real?

2931
02:07:35,760 --> 02:07:37,430
This isn't really a character but

2932
02:07:37,120 --> 02:07:40,990
Chinko machine

2933
02:07:38,600 --> 02:07:39,500
The Chinko machine

2934
02:07:40,260 --> 02:07:42,020
It was because it was when I was sleeping

2935
02:07:41,390 --> 02:07:41,930
Oh yeah!

2936
02:07:41,770 --> 02:07:42,370
I remember that

2937
02:07:42,640 --> 02:07:43,500
I totally remember that

2938
02:07:42,860 --> 02:07:44,660
Breakfast

2939
02:07:42,860 --> 02:07:44,660
Chinko Machine (Hamada)

2940
02:07:42,860 --> 02:07:44,660
Ladle (Hamada, Yamasaki, Endo, Tanaka)

2941
02:07:42,860 --> 02:07:44,660
Radio gymnastics

2942
02:07:43,560 --> 02:07:45,910
That really hit me hard

2943
02:07:45,270 --> 02:07:45,900
I bet

2944
02:07:47,140 --> 02:07:51,740
Like, my body was shattered. We had done all that before it.

2945
02:07:52,150 --> 02:07:55,370
And that old hag came and properly kissed me and all...

2946
02:07:54,560 --> 02:07:55,560
Oh yeah.

2947
02:07:56,090 --> 02:08:01,410
I was shattered and then woken up and then suddenly BAM

2948
02:07:56,440 --> 02:07:57,700
Yeah that's true

2949
02:08:01,970 --> 02:08:05,570
I was like "what the hell" and then I made eye contact with Tanaka

2950
02:08:05,250 --> 02:08:05,740
Yes

2951
02:08:06,050 --> 02:08:08,330
And his face really pissed me off too

2952
02:08:08,780 --> 02:08:10,780
I want to help you but there's nothing I can do at that stage...

2953
02:08:11,230 --> 02:08:12,450
My body wouldn't move either...

2954
02:08:12,840 --> 02:08:15,120
You were looking at me like "What the fuck are you doing?!"

2955
02:08:16,180 --> 02:08:19,370
And the other thing I would write on here would be Tanaka's reaction

2956
02:08:19,750 --> 02:08:20,890
Tanaka's reaction?

2957
02:08:21,400 --> 02:08:24,170
When it went DON, without fail, he would scream

2958
02:08:26,330 --> 02:08:28,110
I was thinking, "Get used to it, man!"

2959
02:08:28,820 --> 02:08:30,360
Well I mean, it's impossible to get used to it, right?

2960
02:08:31,360 --> 02:08:32,410
Wow

2961
02:08:31,570 --> 02:08:33,440
Every single time, you would...

2962
02:08:32,240 --> 02:08:37,140
Chinko Machine (underneath says Tanaka)

2963
02:08:35,180 --> 02:08:37,010
You would be like "Aaaaaaagh"

2964
02:08:37,110 --> 02:08:39,250
I thought if I didn't shout, my brain would just go weird

2965
02:08:39,880 --> 02:08:40,590
In that place

2966
02:08:40,680 --> 02:08:44,520
Character which pissed him off most

2967
02:08:40,680 --> 02:08:44,520
Hamada Masatoshi

2968
02:08:44,520 --> 02:08:47,520
Chinko

2969
02:08:44,520 --> 02:08:47,520
Machine

2970
02:08:47,890 --> 02:08:53,630
21 hours 30 minutes from the start

2971
02:08:47,890 --> 02:08:53,630
5:30 AM

2972
02:08:59,770 --> 02:09:01,480
My body was just so tired at this point

2973
02:09:09,780 --> 02:09:11,120
Oh, make him stop...

2974
02:09:20,290 --> 02:09:21,460
Tanaka's face is funny here.

2975
02:09:35,060 --> 02:09:35,950
That is funny

2976
02:09:37,220 --> 02:09:38,290
That is so funny

2977
02:09:40,610 --> 02:09:43,610
Tanaka's

2978
02:09:40,610 --> 02:09:43,610
reaction

2979
02:09:43,980 --> 02:09:47,050
30 minutes from the start

2980
02:09:43,980 --> 02:09:47,050
8:30 AM

2981
02:09:49,390 --> 02:09:50,070
Wait, what the hell

2982
02:09:50,070 --> 02:09:51,590
Please don't do that!

2983
02:09:52,040 --> 02:09:54,150
I just wanted to see if I could move quickly

2984
02:09:53,380 --> 02:09:55,450
Please don't shock us like that!

2985
02:09:55,680 --> 02:09:57,450
Yeah, please tell us if you're going to do that

2986
02:09:56,930 --> 02:09:58,130
Oh, sorry!

2987
02:09:58,000 --> 02:09:58,940
Come on, man!

2988
02:09:58,740 --> 02:10:00,630
Let's not do that kind of thing to each other

2989
02:10:03,630 --> 02:10:07,940
12:55 PM

2990
02:10:03,630 --> 02:10:07,940
4 hours 55 minutes from the start

2991
02:10:05,220 --> 02:10:06,250
Seriously, man

2992
02:10:06,620 --> 02:10:09,160
It was you, you moved

2993
02:10:07,040 --> 02:10:07,580
No

2994
02:10:07,810 --> 02:10:10,720
Hamada-san, you moved before us

2995
02:10:10,980 --> 02:10:12,250
I just got dragged alone to that

2996
02:10:11,090 --> 02:10:12,510
It was you!

2997
02:10:12,530 --> 02:10:13,720
Your reaction made me react

2998
02:10:14,280 --> 02:10:15,150
And the face he makes...

2999
02:10:14,280 --> 02:10:18,110
4:50 PM

3000
02:10:14,280 --> 02:10:18,110
8 hours 50 minutes from the start

3001
02:10:16,860 --> 02:10:17,740
It's not them...

3002
02:10:18,970 --> 02:10:20,600
You overreacted so much

3003
02:10:19,680 --> 02:10:21,540
Come on, Tanaka

3004
02:10:21,100 --> 02:10:22,580
It's the sound you make which freaks us out

3005
02:10:22,620 --> 02:10:24,500
You shouting "AGHH!"

3006
02:10:24,020 --> 02:10:25,590
Don't shout "AGHH!"

3007
02:10:25,320 --> 02:10:26,790
The noise you made freaked me out just now

3008
02:10:28,160 --> 02:10:33,130
22 hours from start

3009
02:10:28,160 --> 02:10:33,130
6AM (NOTE: GAKI PRODUCERS MADE A MISTAKE HERE AS THIS SEGMENT WAS ACTUALLY FROM THE FIRST BREAKFAST, 30 MINUTES FROM THE START)

3010
02:10:28,370 --> 02:10:28,950
1000 questions...

3011
02:10:29,150 --> 02:10:29,840
Why?

3012
02:10:31,820 --> 02:10:32,700
Sorry

3013
02:10:32,440 --> 02:10:34,300
Oh come on, please don't do that

3014
02:10:34,300 --> 02:10:35,220
What happened?

3015
02:10:35,010 --> 02:10:35,820
This guy

3016
02:10:35,950 --> 02:10:38,210
You overreact far too much!

3017
02:10:36,540 --> 02:10:38,360
You really do

3018
02:10:37,690 --> 02:10:38,640
No, it's not that

3019
02:10:38,750 --> 02:10:39,780
Please stop that

3020
02:10:40,370 --> 02:10:42,700
Moving like that once is so tiring in itself

3021
02:10:44,430 --> 02:10:45,400
You know

3022
02:10:45,150 --> 02:10:45,890
amazing

3023
02:10:46,030 --> 02:10:48,060
This shows how many times

3024
02:10:48,280 --> 02:10:49,120
people got punished in the 24 hours.

3025
02:10:49,580 --> 02:10:50,950
As you can see, we had a lot of things done to us

3026
02:10:50,730 --> 02:10:51,980
So who got the least?

3027
02:10:52,120 --> 02:10:54,220
Tanaka Naoki: 14 times

3028
02:10:52,350 --> 02:10:53,900
4th was Tanaka

3029
02:10:53,920 --> 02:10:54,830
Oh was I?

3030
02:10:55,530 --> 02:10:57,710
But still, 14 times is quite a lot

3031
02:10:56,570 --> 02:10:57,700
Yeah it is

3032
02:10:57,800 --> 02:10:59,270
In 24 hours, that's how many times

3033
02:11:00,060 --> 02:11:00,940
3rd was

3034
02:11:01,160 --> 02:11:02,460
Endo Shozo: 15 times

3035
02:11:01,560 --> 02:11:01,930
Endo

3036
02:11:01,930 --> 02:11:02,370
Me?

3037
02:11:03,010 --> 02:11:04,070
There's not much difference though, huh?

3038
02:11:03,230 --> 02:11:04,030
Yeah

3039
02:11:04,030 --> 02:11:05,430
Between you

3040
02:11:04,180 --> 02:11:04,680
Yeah

3041
02:11:05,700 --> 02:11:06,740
And in second place

3042
02:11:06,930 --> 02:11:08,670
Yamasaki Hosei: 18 times

3043
02:11:07,590 --> 02:11:08,110
Yama-chan

3044
02:11:08,430 --> 02:11:09,460
18 times

3045
02:11:09,040 --> 02:11:10,690
There's not that much difference still

3046
02:11:10,120 --> 02:11:11,010
No, there's not

3047
02:11:10,610 --> 02:11:11,210
Yeah

3048
02:11:11,410 --> 02:11:13,030
And first was me...

3049
02:11:12,370 --> 02:11:16,010
Hamada Masatoshi: 19 times

3050
02:11:13,100 --> 02:11:14,190
19 times

3051
02:11:14,390 --> 02:11:16,000
You're top, huh?

3052
02:11:15,840 --> 02:11:20,290
But when you watch others get hurt, do you not think they have it worse? Like I didn't think I was top.

3053
02:11:20,290 --> 02:11:21,580
That's true

3054
02:11:22,110 --> 02:11:24,210
Endo Shozo: 15 times

3055
02:11:22,110 --> 02:11:24,210
Hamada Masatoshi: 19 times

3056
02:11:22,110 --> 02:11:24,210
Tanaka Naoki: 14 times

3057
02:11:22,110 --> 02:11:24,210
Yamasaki Hosei: 18 times

3058
02:11:22,190 --> 02:11:24,820
But I was first, but anyway, this is how many times.

3059
02:11:24,900 --> 02:11:26,530
So what's the total?

3060
02:11:26,580 --> 02:11:27,800
Altogether...

3061
02:11:28,110 --> 02:11:29,700
60, 70?

3062
02:11:29,290 --> 02:11:30,430
around 70 I think

3063
02:11:32,000 --> 02:11:33,030
That's amazing

3064
02:11:32,850 --> 02:11:35,080
I mean this was something else

3065
02:11:34,740 --> 02:11:35,420
It was

3066
02:11:35,490 --> 02:11:37,490
If you were there...

3067
02:11:38,030 --> 02:11:39,190
It really was hell

3068
02:11:40,020 --> 02:11:41,650
It really was amazing

3069
02:11:40,340 --> 02:11:40,990
Yeah

3070
02:11:41,350 --> 02:11:43,340
Yama-chan got done when he just went to toilet!

3071
02:11:43,650 --> 02:11:45,030
Oh yeah!

3072
02:11:45,490 --> 02:11:48,720
Toilets should be a safe place, I mean remember the toilet in the haunted hotel?

3073
02:11:49,420 --> 02:11:52,210
You shouldn't do stuff in the toilet. Like you know

3074
02:11:53,790 --> 02:11:56,480
it's physiological, you have to go.

3075
02:11:57,050 --> 02:11:58,950
It's like the most private time too...

3076
02:11:58,950 --> 02:12:01,320
It's like the most private time too...

3077
02:12:01,590 --> 02:12:04,760
11:50 PM

3078
02:12:01,590 --> 02:12:04,760
15 hours 50 minutes from the start

3079
02:12:30,050 --> 02:12:31,590
Hey guys!

3080
02:12:32,130 --> 02:12:33,040
What was that?

3081
02:12:32,570 --> 02:12:33,620
Hey guys!

3082
02:12:37,680 --> 02:12:38,290
What happened?

3083
02:12:38,910 --> 02:12:39,960
They were in the toilet!

3084
02:12:41,220 --> 02:12:42,440
They were in the toilet!

3085
02:12:42,980 --> 02:12:43,700
Those black things?

3086
02:12:44,040 --> 02:12:44,760
Yeah

3087
02:12:45,360 --> 02:12:59,480
1 night in a haunted hotel

3088
02:12:45,360 --> 02:12:59,480
Matsumoto Hitoshi Batsu Game

3089
02:12:49,850 --> 02:12:52,100
This is not on! This is not on!

3090
02:12:52,480 --> 02:12:53,490
This is just not on!

3091
02:12:53,290 --> 02:12:54,400
What's wrong?

3092
02:12:53,770 --> 02:12:55,290
No, no way, man!

3093
02:12:54,870 --> 02:12:56,200
What's wrong?

3094
02:12:55,570 --> 02:12:57,160
Please, at least let me piss!

3095
02:12:59,980 --> 02:13:01,050
Did we really need Fujiwara here?

3096
02:13:01,050 --> 02:13:03,450
Did we really need Fujiwara here?

3097
02:13:03,980 --> 02:13:05,930
He didn't say anything really...

3098
02:13:06,360 --> 02:13:06,930
Fujiwara

3099
02:13:06,920 --> 02:13:09,620
I'm sure he's come here for a purpose

3100
02:13:09,210 --> 02:13:10,010
Oh, really?

3101
02:13:10,320 --> 02:13:11,180
I see

3102
02:13:10,330 --> 02:13:11,790
Sorry

3103
02:13:12,200 --> 02:13:16,040
I worked hard there myself

3104
02:13:16,430 --> 02:13:18,740
at the 24-hour tag game

3105
02:13:19,120 --> 02:13:21,560
you know so um...

3106
02:13:22,660 --> 02:13:24,400
so I made a highlight reel of myself

3107
02:13:24,400 --> 02:13:25,660
so I made a highlight reel of myself

3108
02:13:25,660 --> 02:13:29,750
so I made a highlight reel of myself

3109
02:13:29,860 --> 02:13:32,710
and I would like you to watch it

3110
02:13:33,450 --> 02:13:34,110
if you would, please

3111
02:13:35,350 --> 02:13:36,180
He really has tempo, doesn't he?

3112
02:13:36,180 --> 02:13:38,620
He really has tempo, doesn't he?

3113
02:13:36,980 --> 02:13:37,820
No!

3114
02:13:38,010 --> 02:13:39,080
No, he doesn't!

3115
02:13:38,960 --> 02:13:39,720
That?!

3116
02:13:40,450 --> 02:13:42,790
It was annoying me so much

3117
02:13:41,140 --> 02:13:41,710
Sorry...

3118
02:13:42,500 --> 02:13:43,570
Just talk normally!

3119
02:13:43,340 --> 02:13:43,820
Sorry

3120
02:13:44,420 --> 02:13:44,920
I thought he spoke at a great tempo

3121
02:13:44,920 --> 02:13:47,530
I thought he spoke at a great tempo

3122
02:13:47,690 --> 02:13:51,530
Fujiwara Hiroshi

3123
02:13:47,690 --> 02:13:51,530
Highlight reel

3124
02:13:51,540 --> 02:13:53,390
Come, gather around these boobs

3125
02:13:54,120 --> 02:13:55,000
This guy's an idiot

3126
02:13:55,470 --> 02:13:55,880
Come over here

3127
02:13:56,200 --> 02:13:56,760
Morning

3128
02:13:57,470 --> 02:13:59,130
Come, gather around these boobs

3129
02:13:59,790 --> 02:14:00,690
This is right at the start

3130
02:14:00,690 --> 02:14:01,490
When he's explaining everything

3131
02:14:04,110 --> 02:14:05,410
Why the hell for the likes of you

3132
02:14:05,410 --> 02:14:07,180
Why the hell for the likes of you

3133
02:14:07,180 --> 02:14:10,320
do I have to wake up this early?

3134
02:14:10,570 --> 02:14:14,160
I have been given your orders from Matsumoto-san

3135
02:14:14,240 --> 02:14:15,920
Why were you dressed like this?

3136
02:14:16,980 --> 02:14:17,920
So true...

3137
02:14:17,500 --> 02:14:20,160
So think of what I say as what Matsumoto-san is saying

3138
02:14:20,540 --> 02:14:21,460
and make sure to listen to me

3139
02:14:21,860 --> 02:14:23,130
Especially you, Hamada!

3140
02:14:23,130 --> 02:14:25,700
You try to show how much of a bad guy you are

3141
02:14:25,560 --> 02:14:28,040
but today, listen to what Matsumoto-san

3142
02:14:28,920 --> 02:14:30,070
has to say, okay?

3143
02:14:34,040 --> 02:14:34,830
God, that's annoying

3144
02:14:35,630 --> 02:14:37,540
Come, gather around these boobs

3145
02:14:36,840 --> 02:14:38,410
What do you want?

3146
02:14:39,810 --> 02:14:40,970
Even for the likes of you

3147
02:14:42,170 --> 02:14:43,970
Matsumoto-san arranged to feed you

3148
02:14:43,500 --> 02:14:44,780
Wow, that's amazing

3149
02:14:44,810 --> 02:14:45,690
It is

3150
02:14:46,220 --> 02:14:46,990
His kindness truly

3151
02:14:46,990 --> 02:14:48,890
His kindness truly

3152
02:14:47,620 --> 02:14:48,510
Oh, it's bread?

3153
02:14:48,890 --> 02:14:51,930
can be felt by your organs

3154
02:14:49,160 --> 02:14:50,210
I would have preferred rice

3155
02:14:50,210 --> 02:14:51,150
Yeah

3156
02:14:51,170 --> 02:14:52,130
Yeah

3157
02:14:54,530 --> 02:14:55,530
His kindness truly can be felt by your organs

3158
02:14:55,530 --> 02:14:57,930
His kindness truly can be felt by your organs

3159
02:14:56,920 --> 02:14:57,710
Okay, well then let's take it

3160
02:14:59,500 --> 02:15:00,240
He wouldn't let us take it

3161
02:15:01,240 --> 02:15:02,170
Matsumoto-san's kindness can truly by felt by your organs

3162
02:15:02,170 --> 02:15:02,800
Matsumoto-san's kindness can truly be felt  by your organs

3163
02:15:02,800 --> 02:15:05,210
Matsumoto-san's kindness can truly be felt by your organs

3164
02:15:04,180 --> 02:15:05,630
How many times are you going to say that?

3165
02:15:06,020 --> 02:15:08,250
You look bored so I brought out some newspapers...

3166
02:15:09,280 --> 02:15:10,680
You can look at it whilst making a stupid face or something

3167
02:15:10,680 --> 02:15:13,150
You can look at it whilst making a stupid face or something

3168
02:15:13,950 --> 02:15:15,620
Yamasaki

3169
02:15:15,620 --> 02:15:17,420
You're an idiot, aren't you?

3170
02:15:17,260 --> 02:15:17,880
What the hell?

3171
02:15:18,720 --> 02:15:19,220
I don't need you to reply

3172
02:15:19,220 --> 02:15:21,160
I don't need you to reply

3173
02:15:23,390 --> 02:15:23,990
God that pisses me off

3174
02:15:24,560 --> 02:15:26,090
Cocorico

3175
02:15:26,090 --> 02:15:27,260
Just because you have a show on Tere-Asa

3176
02:15:27,260 --> 02:15:29,930
Just because you have a show on Tere-Asa

3177
02:15:29,930 --> 02:15:31,670
Acting bossy and all...

3178
02:15:32,040 --> 02:15:32,900
What the hell?

3179
02:15:32,640 --> 02:15:34,920
No, we haven't...

3180
02:15:38,530 --> 02:15:39,600
Don't you have anything to say to Hamada-san?

3181
02:15:41,140 --> 02:15:41,870
Guys, it's 3 o'clock

3182
02:15:43,580 --> 02:15:44,850
Hamada, what do you think of at 3 o'clock?

3183
02:15:44,850 --> 02:15:46,780
Hamada, what do you think of at 3 o'clock?

3184
02:15:46,780 --> 02:15:48,120
Snacks.

3185
02:15:48,120 --> 02:15:50,250
Stop being so pathetic

3186
02:15:51,320 --> 02:15:53,490
Here's your 3 o'clock snack

3187
02:15:53,190 --> 02:15:54,160
What the hell?

3188
02:15:54,750 --> 02:15:55,320
And on top of that

3189
02:15:56,920 --> 02:15:58,250
I prepared you a game

3190
02:16:00,300 --> 02:16:00,800
Whilst living out your pathetic lives, you should play

3191
02:16:00,800 --> 02:16:02,030
Whilst living out your pathetic lives, you should play

3192
02:16:02,030 --> 02:16:03,900
Whilst living out your pathetic lives, you should play

3193
02:16:03,900 --> 02:16:06,640
The Game of Life

3194
02:16:07,810 --> 02:16:08,840
Aren't you going to say that was a good one?

3195
02:16:08,630 --> 02:16:10,270
You're so annoying

3196
02:16:10,940 --> 02:16:11,770
Matsumoto-san said

3197
02:16:13,310 --> 02:16:14,480
You look tired

3198
02:16:15,560 --> 02:16:17,310
so he said have something sweet and handed me these

3199
02:16:18,680 --> 02:16:20,050
Matsumoto-san's kindness truly knows no bounds

3200
02:16:20,050 --> 02:16:22,220
Matsumoto-san's kindness truly knows no bounds

3201
02:16:22,220 --> 02:16:24,220
You're holding them out of their packets...

3202
02:16:23,540 --> 02:16:23,970
Eat up

3203
02:16:24,270 --> 02:16:25,910
No no no

3204
02:16:26,130 --> 02:16:26,500
Eat it

3205
02:16:26,620 --> 02:16:27,450
I said I don't want to

3206
02:16:27,310 --> 02:16:27,950
Eat it I said

3207
02:16:29,760 --> 02:16:30,930
Why did he bring them on his hand?

3208
02:16:30,590 --> 02:16:31,580
You must be so tired

3209
02:16:32,130 --> 02:16:32,590
Hamada

3210
02:16:33,610 --> 02:16:34,040
Here

3211
02:16:36,200 --> 02:16:37,100
You must be tired

3212
02:16:37,410 --> 02:16:38,030
Oh no no no

3213
02:16:38,670 --> 02:16:39,410
You got to eat it

3214
02:16:41,570 --> 02:16:43,870
There's loads of shit on it...

3215
02:16:45,040 --> 02:16:46,470
Oh well

3216
02:16:47,950 --> 02:16:48,620
No no no

3217
02:16:51,060 --> 02:16:52,400
There's stuff on it...

3218
02:16:54,660 --> 02:16:56,260
This is such a mess...

3219
02:16:57,400 --> 02:16:59,100
Don't use tissue

3220
02:16:58,170 --> 02:17:00,190
Tissue will stick

3221
02:16:59,770 --> 02:17:00,760
That's disgusting

3222
02:17:02,650 --> 02:17:03,420
You must be tired

3223
02:17:08,110 --> 02:17:09,180
That's enough, man

3224
02:17:10,980 --> 02:17:11,730
Don't take it out

3225
02:17:17,110 --> 02:17:19,140
Matsumoto-san's kindness really knows no bounds

3226
02:17:19,140 --> 02:17:21,480
Matsumoto-san's kindness really knows no bounds

3227
02:17:22,830 --> 02:17:23,740
Matsumoto-san said

3228
02:17:26,570 --> 02:17:27,810
he would let you sleep now

3229
02:17:32,090 --> 02:17:34,890
Matsumoto-san's kindness can deceive a child

3230
02:17:34,890 --> 02:17:36,630
Matsumoto-san's kindness can deceive a child

3231
02:17:36,630 --> 02:17:39,300
Who's accusing him of deceiving children!?

3232
02:17:43,150 --> 02:17:43,800
He could barely say it

3233
02:17:45,290 --> 02:17:45,890
Look, he's kicking us

3234
02:18:00,290 --> 02:18:02,080
Come, gather around these boobs

3235
02:18:01,610 --> 02:18:02,540
Oh, enough!

3236
02:18:02,140 --> 02:18:02,890
We don't need this

3237
02:18:02,980 --> 02:18:04,170
His boob wasn't even out there

3238
02:18:04,040 --> 02:18:06,090
That's true, he just said it!

3239
02:18:06,660 --> 02:18:08,620
Come, gather around these boobs!

3240
02:18:08,940 --> 02:18:09,420
Alright...

3241
02:18:10,420 --> 02:18:11,510
meat-meat-meat-meat-meat

3242
02:18:11,810 --> 02:18:12,520
My meat

3243
02:18:14,280 --> 02:18:16,450
Even close by, gather around

3244
02:18:16,700 --> 02:18:18,330
Even beside me, gather around

3245
02:18:19,860 --> 02:18:21,740
Gero-Gero, Gero-Gero

3246
02:18:22,580 --> 02:18:23,380
Chewing Pon

3247
02:18:28,760 --> 02:18:30,650
Flashily gather around

3248
02:18:32,680 --> 02:18:33,630
I don't really get it

3249
02:18:35,580 --> 02:18:36,340
but that was funny

3250
02:18:36,950 --> 02:18:37,680
Thank you!

3251
02:18:38,420 --> 02:18:41,000
That last part, when it showed him...

3252
02:18:41,760 --> 02:18:42,230
He was sniggering so much over here

3253
02:18:42,230 --> 02:18:42,490
He was sniggering so much over here

3254
02:18:42,490 --> 02:18:44,130
He was sniggering so much over here

3255
02:18:46,130 --> 02:18:48,970
At your own footage?

3256
02:18:47,380 --> 02:18:48,500
Sorry.

3257
02:18:49,030 --> 02:18:49,630
But why?

3258
02:18:52,390 --> 02:18:53,360
But seriously

3259
02:18:53,960 --> 02:18:55,490
We wouldn't be able to do that again

3260
02:18:55,630 --> 02:18:55,990
No

3261
02:18:56,220 --> 02:18:57,430
I think it's our age

3262
02:18:56,560 --> 02:18:59,510
No... That would be tough

3263
02:18:57,520 --> 02:18:58,480
A question of age

3264
02:18:57,580 --> 02:18:59,040
It'd be too hard

3265
02:18:59,840 --> 02:19:00,750
Yeah

3266
02:19:00,760 --> 02:19:03,560
Back then, Cocorico and maybe Yamasaki

3267
02:19:03,660 --> 02:19:04,550
were still in their 20's, right?

3268
02:19:04,200 --> 02:19:04,910
Yes

3269
02:19:04,200 --> 02:19:05,460
We were

3270
02:19:05,870 --> 02:19:07,240
No, I was 32

3271
02:19:07,970 --> 02:19:08,650
and Cocorico were

3272
02:19:08,030 --> 02:19:09,040
28

3273
02:19:08,040 --> 02:19:09,260
28

3274
02:19:09,370 --> 02:19:11,700
I see, so Cocorico were still

3275
02:19:12,110 --> 02:19:13,860
Yeah, it might be a bit tough now, huh?

3276
02:19:13,860 --> 02:19:14,820
It was tough

3277
02:19:14,280 --> 02:19:14,840
It was

3278
02:19:15,260 --> 02:19:15,700
I mean the leader is already 40 years old...

3279
02:19:15,700 --> 02:19:18,400
I mean the leader is already 40 years old...

3280
02:19:16,730 --> 02:19:17,300
Leader...

3281
02:19:17,830 --> 02:19:19,630
That's true, that would be hard

3282
02:19:18,040 --> 02:19:19,980
Yeah

3283
02:19:19,980 --> 02:19:20,510
That would be

3284
02:19:20,800 --> 02:19:22,010
It would

3285
02:19:21,290 --> 02:19:23,390
It'd be difficult

3286
02:19:22,250 --> 02:19:23,340
So true

3287
02:19:23,930 --> 02:19:25,400
It would be

3288
02:19:25,490 --> 02:19:26,850
This is the first one?

3289
02:19:26,970 --> 02:19:27,430
What?

3290
02:19:27,720 --> 02:19:29,210
It's going to continue

3291
02:19:29,570 --> 02:19:30,100
The DVD series

3292
02:19:30,150 --> 02:19:31,070
Oh right, the DVD series

3293
02:19:30,490 --> 02:19:31,100
Yes

3294
02:19:31,470 --> 02:19:33,770
So today, we are just doing the Tag game.

3295
02:19:33,530 --> 02:19:34,000
That's right

3296
02:19:34,770 --> 02:19:37,230
Well I'm sure there will be more

3297
02:19:36,710 --> 02:19:38,660
After this, there is also the Haunted Hotel

3298
02:19:38,700 --> 02:19:40,620
Oh I see

3299
02:19:39,150 --> 02:19:41,340
and the Do Not Laugh series

3300
02:19:40,380 --> 02:19:41,130
That's right

3301
02:19:41,630 --> 02:19:43,470
And I'm sure there will be a lot of things

3302
02:19:43,590 --> 02:19:44,960
But let's shut up about the money thing

3303
02:19:44,960 --> 02:19:47,560
But let's shut up about the money thing

3304
02:19:45,560 --> 02:19:46,180
You know?

3305
02:19:46,430 --> 02:19:46,970
What?

3306
02:19:46,780 --> 02:19:47,240
