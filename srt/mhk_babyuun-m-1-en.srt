When the peace on the planet is broken

I will absolutely never forgive

The invulnerable warrior Babyunn M !!

00:00:26,540 --> 00:00:32,050
I want to see everyone smile

I wish for everyone's happiness

10
00:00:37,590 --> 00:00:42,860
Today's explosion! Danger Fire!

11
00:00:42,860 --> 00:00:48,330
Babyuun Bike goes at 200 kilometers per hour

00:00:48,330 --> 00:00:55,040
Let's go! Showtime! Wheelie Rider!

13

Ah~ Babyuun M !!

21
00:01:21,230 --> 00:01:26,840
I can't believe it, did you get into an accident?

22
00:01:26,840 --> 00:01:32,310
I will absolutely never admit it

23
00:01:32,310 --> 00:01:37,650
The invulnerable warrior Babyuun M !!

24
00:01:37,650 --> 00:01:42,990
Is this worth it, is it really useless?

25
00:01:42,990 --> 00:01:48,290
As the way things are, should I be motivated?

26
00:01:48,290 --> 00:01:53,630
The invulnerable warrior Babyuun M !!

27
00:01:53,630 --> 00:01:58,870
To continue as things are, it is painful to picture this.

28
00:01:58,870 --> 00:02:04,310
They know it hurts, the kids have seen this all.

29
00:02:04,310 --> 00:02:09,680
The invulnerable warrior Babyuun M !!

30
00:02:09,680 --> 00:02:14,790
Are there difficulties? Are there things to grumble about?

31
00:02:14,790 --> 00:02:19,490
What the hell are you?

32
00:02:20,360 --> 00:02:22,830
Super human! Steel Man!

33
00:02:22,830 --> 00:02:25,630
Ah~ Babyuun M !!

34
00:02:25,630 --> 00:02:30,840
Are you saying that just for the sake of the money?

35
00:02:30,840 --> 00:02:36,140
What are you waiting, the motivation to get up?

36
00:02:36,140 --> 00:02:41,610
Money hungry! Babyuun M !!

37
00:02:41,610 --> 00:02:46,950
Haven't you suffered enough from that depression?

38
00:02:46,950 --> 00:02:52,290
Have you tried to strike it from the inside out?

39
00:02:52,290 --> 00:02:57,630
Why don't you change it all? Babyuun M !!

40
00:02:57,630 --> 00:03:02,900
By the way, do you know how to fix this?

41
00:03:02,900 --> 00:03:08,070
Do you know how to paint the metal sheets?

42
00:03:08,070 --> 00:03:13,680
I will do it, Babyuun M !!

43
00:03:13,680 --> 00:03:18,950
Will the insurance take care of things like that?

44
00:03:18,950 --> 00:03:24,190
Will the insurance take care of that crap?

45
00:03:24,190 --> 00:03:29,590
Don't you think I should have entered automobile liability?

46
00:03:29,590 --> 00:03:34,930
When you are driving in a zig zag like that

47
00:03:34,930 --> 00:03:40,270
It's dangerous and you should have seen it coming!

48
00:03:41,670 --> 00:03:44,110
Super human! Steel Man!

49
00:03:44,110 --> 00:03:47,040
Ah~ Babyuun M !!

50
00:03:52,380 --> 00:03:57,390
In the end you'll make pranks at the garden place

51
00:03:57,390 --> 00:04:02,830
Given the situation, you'll take a shortcut

52
00:04:02,830 --> 00:04:08,270
Go down Kyu Yamate, Babyuun M !!

53
00:04:08,270 --> 00:04:13,070
Don't underestimate the five road junction!

54
00:04:13,070 --> 00:04:18,910
Why did you go down in the direction of Nakamegura Yarigasaki?

55
00:04:18,910 --> 00:04:24,150
If I'm not wrong, that traffic light arrow will fade out soon so it's hard to know

56
00:04:24,150 --> 00:04:29,420
I was relieved that the police box had no one in there!

57
00:04:29,420 --> 00:04:36,130
Did you say I would not be able to hold my liquor?

58
00:04:36,130 --> 00:04:38,830
Ordinary man! Mediocre man!

59
00:04:38,830 --> 00:04:41,600
Ah~ Babyuun M !!

60
00:04:41,600 --> 00:04:44,170
Mediocre! Mediocre!

61
00:04:44,170 --> 00:04:47,040
Ultra mediocre man M
