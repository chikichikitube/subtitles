00:00:02,450 --> 00:00:04,570
Welcome to Wednesday Downtown,

2
00:00:07,210 --> 00:00:09,830
Letâ€™s get on with our first presenter please

3
00:00:15,500 --> 00:00:17,620
Harisenbon

4
00:00:19,780 --> 00:00:22,170
In the past there was a verification

5
00:00:22,170 --> 00:00:28,280
Will tsukkomi comedian's say "You're gonna sing it?"
-Yes

6
00:00:28,280 --> 00:00:34,700
Situations were created to encourage them to say "you're gonna sing it?"

7
00:00:34,700 --> 00:00:37,930
We verified it with 5 people

8
00:00:37,930 --> 00:00:41,090
Only FUJIWARA's Fujimoto said it

9
00:00:41,090 --> 00:00:43,620
Ah really?
-Is that so?

10
00:00:43,620 --> 00:00:47,000
Mr. "You're gonna sing it?" Hamada...
-No, no, no...

11
00:00:47,000 --> 00:00:49,550
I can't believe you didn't say anything.
-Well, I really wouldn't

12
00:00:49,550 --> 00:00:52,300
That was a bit shocking
-It was really shocking

13
00:00:52,300 --> 00:00:54,800
He's usually quick to attack
-No, no, no

14
00:00:55,850 --> 00:00:57,850
This is it

15
00:01:14,420 --> 00:01:17,910
Because of this, it is necessary to bet on the reputation of spiteful comedians

16
00:01:17,910 --> 00:01:19,890
So, we bring a new spin on this

17
00:01:20,830 --> 00:01:26,370
Like "you're gonna sing it?" tsukkomi comedians will retort regardless of the situation

18
00:01:29,400 --> 00:01:31,190
I hope they'll do it
-Hopefully

19
00:01:31,190 --> 00:01:32,940
Really hope

20
00:01:32,940 --> 00:01:35,450
For the boke you can't really tsukkomi either

21
00:01:35,450 --> 00:01:38,710
It's impossible

22
00:01:38,710 --> 00:01:40,950
It's like trying to open your mouth with the sides shut

23
00:01:40,950 --> 00:01:41,890
I can't do it

24
00:01:41,890 --> 00:01:44,110
No, no, no...your analogy is too much

25
00:01:44,110 --> 00:01:46,350
Awful, ~Deep kiss~

26
00:01:46,350 --> 00:01:49,390
Aren't you resisting a bit too much?

27
00:01:49,820 --> 00:01:54,750
Next, will they really say "you're gonna XXX?"

28
00:01:54,750 --> 00:01:57,850
It'll be verified in different contexts

29
00:01:57,850 --> 00:01:58,600
Also...

30
00:01:58,600 --> 00:02:00,170
If you can't take it, get out

31
00:02:00,770 --> 00:02:05,100
Discouragement contest for mild-mannered entertainers

32
00:02:05,300 --> 00:02:12,740
Also, is it true that comedians regularly receive memorable and creepy fan letters

33
00:02:29,140 --> 00:02:38,400
Like "you're gonna sing it?" tsukkomi comedians will retort regardless of the situation

34
00:02:39,190 --> 00:02:43,550
In the previous "You're gonna sing it?" verification

35
00:02:47,410 --> 00:02:49,210
You're gonna sing it!?

36
00:02:49,830 --> 00:02:53,040
Fujimoto was the only one who reacted as expected

37
00:02:53,040 --> 00:02:55,120
These were the results

38
00:02:54,450 --> 00:02:55,290
Indeed

39
00:02:55,580 --> 00:03:04,160
This time, we created 5 scenarios other than singing to conduct a similar verification

40
00:03:05,200 --> 00:03:09,630
The first target is

41
00:03:09,630 --> 00:03:11,450
Hashimoto

42
00:03:12,330 --> 00:03:13,860
Last time

43
00:03:19,280 --> 00:03:23,100
He failed to retort

44
00:03:23,100 --> 00:03:28,700
What is the phrase he is expected to say this time?

45
00:03:29,690 --> 00:03:32,720
"You're gonna eat it?"

46
00:03:32,970 --> 00:03:37,000
The setting is a sushi restaurant

47
00:03:37,000 --> 00:03:43,200
The person making the sushi will suddenly eat it after presenting it

48
00:03:43,200 --> 00:03:45,340
What will happen?

49
00:03:46,360 --> 00:03:48,910
This happening in private would be pretty scary

50
00:03:47,410 --> 00:03:49,210
How do you know about this place?

51
00:03:49,210 --> 00:03:51,010
Feels so high-class

52
00:03:51,800 --> 00:03:56,010
They first have some appetizers

53
00:03:56,010 --> 00:03:58,050
Singapore seems like a hot place

54
00:03:58,050 --> 00:03:58,620
Seems so

55
00:03:59,280 --> 00:04:00,760
Is it okay to just wear sunscreen there?

56
00:04:00,760 --> 00:04:01,980
Uh, yeah...

57
00:04:02,550 --> 00:04:05,060
Are you still in touch with your previous girlfriend?

58
00:04:05,060 --> 00:04:06,190
No contact at all

59
00:04:06,190 --> 00:04:09,490
Don't you want to get in touch again or something like that? Could you?

60
00:04:10,200 --> 00:04:15,960
Talking about career and love as if they were OLs, during the the middle of their conversation...

61
00:04:16,710 --> 00:04:18,950
Finally, it's time for sushi!

62
00:04:18,950 --> 00:04:25,770
Will Hashimoto say "you're gonna eat it?"

63
00:04:24,120 --> 00:04:27,760
Hard to say

64
00:04:29,050 --> 00:04:31,420
Here is the snapper
-Thank you

65
00:04:37,900 --> 00:04:39,970
You'd be shocked, right?

66
00:04:39,960 --> 00:04:43,380
The same as last time!

67
00:04:40,670 --> 00:04:43,440
He couldn't tsukkomi

68
00:04:44,560 --> 00:04:47,320
This is very difficult, its too surprising, right?

69
00:04:44,890 --> 00:04:46,510
Here is the snapper
-Thank you

70
00:04:51,030 --> 00:04:52,380
Here is the snapper
-Thank you

71
00:05:01,850 --> 00:05:04,720
Taste test...

72
00:05:04,720 --> 00:05:08,920
Is it because I'm a comedian that he's playing with me a bit?

73
00:05:08,570 --> 00:05:10,050
Still doesn't understand the situation

74
00:05:09,570 --> 00:05:15,920
As there was no immediate retort, it seems he's not aware its a prank

75
00:05:15,920 --> 00:05:18,240
So, we continue to verify

76
00:05:19,230 --> 00:05:21,710
Squid

77
00:05:23,570 --> 00:05:25,210
A little frightened

78
00:05:23,700 --> 00:05:25,610
Great! Great!

79
00:05:25,610 --> 00:05:27,940
Start from squid, great!

80
00:05:27,940 --> 00:05:30,680
I thought it was a trick. Scary

81
00:05:31,640 --> 00:05:33,950
White shrimp

82
00:05:37,080 --> 00:05:38,620
It's squid.
-And shrimp?

83
00:05:38,970 --> 00:05:44,970
We let him eat two rounds to relax

84
00:05:48,030 --> 00:05:49,460
Sashimi

85
00:05:53,770 --> 00:05:55,460
Master...

86
00:05:57,700 --> 00:05:58,800
What's going on?

87
00:06:00,050 --> 00:06:07,140
After that, this occurs one in three rounds

88
00:06:07,210 --> 00:06:08,550
Wait...

89
00:06:09,010 --> 00:06:09,750
No, no, wait...

90
00:06:10,890 --> 00:06:15,290
As a result, he's unable to say anything

91
00:06:15,290 --> 00:06:17,630
So, we disclosed the truth

92
00:06:16,720 --> 00:06:18,320
That's no good

93
00:06:22,900 --> 00:06:24,700
Wait... that's enough

94
00:06:24,150 --> 00:06:25,520
His face is red

95
00:06:26,460 --> 00:06:29,800
Brain... his brain is sick, right?

96
00:06:29,800 --> 00:06:31,800
What the hell?

97
00:06:31,800 --> 00:06:33,570
Do you know what the program is?

98
00:06:34,170 --> 00:06:37,880
The only one who would do such a thing is that show, right?

99
00:06:38,340 --> 00:06:40,450
Something like "you're gonna sing it?"

100
00:06:40,980 --> 00:06:44,180
Tsukkomi comedians will tsukkomi in any situation

101
00:06:44,180 --> 00:06:47,320
This isn't normal

102
00:06:47,320 --> 00:06:50,990
In this kind of high-end restaurant, no one would do it

103
00:06:51,360 --> 00:06:53,120
Its too confusing for it to be taken away

104
00:06:53,120 --> 00:06:55,660
But I thought maybe that was just his style

105
00:06:56,090 --> 00:06:58,760
You wouldn't say "you're gonna sing it", but how about something similar?

106
00:06:59,100 --> 00:07:03,770
In front of the camera and in ordinary daily life

107
00:07:03,770 --> 00:07:06,340
It's a completely different story

108
00:07:07,040 --> 00:07:10,440
I don't live my life like i'm constantly on Wednesday Downtown

109
00:07:11,270 --> 00:07:13,900
So, acknowledging the comments made

110
00:07:13,900 --> 00:07:18,670
Next we decide to conduct an on-camera verification

111
00:07:19,780 --> 00:07:22,850
The next target is

112
00:07:22,850 --> 00:07:25,320
Komoto

113
00:07:26,060 --> 00:07:28,150
Although he is not the tsukkomi of his group

114
00:07:28,150 --> 00:07:32,470
He often takes such a role on variety shows

115
00:07:32,470 --> 00:07:35,680
The key word for this challenge is

116
00:07:35,680 --> 00:07:37,900
"You're gonna kick it?"

117
00:07:38,850 --> 00:07:41,220
In a fake soccer show

118
00:07:41,220 --> 00:07:47,180
The referee will suddenly kick the ball

119
00:07:47,180 --> 00:07:51,720
Will Komoto say "you're gonna kick it?"

120
00:07:53,020 --> 00:07:55,200
Let's go everyone!

121
00:08:01,360 --> 00:08:03,450
15 minutes into the game

122
00:08:13,660 --> 00:08:15,510
Komoto is fouled

123
00:08:15,510 --> 00:08:19,580
And has a chance to take a free kick

124
00:08:18,200 --> 00:08:21,020
Clever setup

125
00:08:25,650 --> 00:08:26,940
What a serious expression!

126
00:08:26,940 --> 00:08:28,940
Not a comedian right now

127
00:08:27,650 --> 00:08:31,940
Scatter a bit, you're too bunched together

128
00:08:33,580 --> 00:08:34,760
So serious, feels as if he'll be angry

129
00:08:34,760 --> 00:08:36,680
He is on camera after all

130
00:08:53,480 --> 00:08:55,380
Doesn't understand

131
00:08:54,820 --> 00:08:57,350
Couldn't say it

132
00:08:57,820 --> 00:08:59,450
Who could?

133
00:09:00,530 --> 00:09:01,960
Nice goal!

134
00:09:15,370 --> 00:09:18,340
The truth is revealed

135
00:09:19,000 --> 00:09:21,810
Why do you keep playing soccer like nothing happened?

136
00:09:21,810 --> 00:09:23,540
Unbelievable things have happened!

137
00:09:24,040 --> 00:09:25,440
Not stopping?

138
00:09:25,640 --> 00:09:27,280
Hey, it's not right, it's not right

139
00:09:27,280 --> 00:09:28,810
Thank you for your hard work

140
00:09:31,200 --> 00:09:32,350
Thank you for your hard work

141
00:09:32,820 --> 00:09:36,850
We wanted to see if you'd say "you're gonna kick it?"

142
00:09:39,560 --> 00:09:42,720
Its not something to say in this situation

143
00:09:43,360 --> 00:09:47,320
So, the next target is

144
00:09:47,320 --> 00:09:49,750
Jinnai Tomonori

145
00:09:48,460 --> 00:09:50,320
This one is reliable

146
00:09:49,750 --> 00:09:54,870
What is the situation this time that will encourage him to say "you're gonna do it?"

147
00:09:55,140 --> 00:09:58,660
Art Star Discovery Center

148
00:09:58,660 --> 00:10:00,720
In this fabricated show

149
00:10:01,430 --> 00:10:04,070
Hiking Walking is a guest

150
00:10:04,820 --> 00:10:07,150
I will drink the coke and hold back my burps

151
00:10:07,150 --> 00:10:10,020
While saying the station names of the Yamanote Line loop in one breath

152
00:10:11,350 --> 00:10:14,630
In this setup

153
00:10:14,630 --> 00:10:20,000
The female host will burp instead

154
00:10:19,060 --> 00:10:21,960
It should be easy to say in this situation, right?

155
00:10:20,590 --> 00:10:21,990
The result?

156
00:10:21,960 --> 00:10:23,370
To say it to a woman though...

157
00:10:22,930 --> 00:10:24,740
I mostly drink ten bottles a day

158
00:10:24,740 --> 00:10:26,340
This one's gonna be funny

159
00:10:26,340 --> 00:10:29,110
This gets laughs in the theatre

160
00:10:33,140 --> 00:10:35,830
He'll say it, right?

161
00:10:35,830 --> 00:10:37,550
He's not in "off" mode

162
00:10:39,350 --> 00:10:40,440
Tokyo

163
00:10:40,440 --> 00:10:41,680
Araracho

164
00:10:41,680 --> 00:10:42,790
Shinbashi

165
00:10:43,320 --> 00:10:44,890
You're gonna burp?

166
00:10:45,660 --> 00:10:47,100
Awesome!

167
00:10:47,980 --> 00:10:49,660
As expected of Jinnai

168
00:10:50,840 --> 00:10:53,060
He did it

169
00:10:53,300 --> 00:10:54,440
Shinbashi

170
00:10:55,000 --> 00:10:56,370
You're gonna burp?

171
00:10:57,100 --> 00:10:59,840
You're gonna burp?

172
00:10:59,840 --> 00:11:00,370
What's going on?

173
00:11:00,570 --> 00:11:02,170
Wait. Wait a minute. Hey?

174
00:11:03,720 --> 00:11:05,380
You burped too, so sloppy!

175
00:11:06,380 --> 00:11:08,050
What a slob. Who was it?

176
00:11:08,910 --> 00:11:11,290
Here we reveal the truth

177
00:11:09,780 --> 00:11:10,960
What a quick response!

178
00:11:11,580 --> 00:11:14,920
Thank you for your hard work

179
00:11:12,500 --> 00:11:14,440
As expected

180
00:11:14,920 --> 00:11:16,150
Eh?

181
00:11:16,150 --> 00:11:17,590
Thank you for your hard work

182
00:11:17,590 --> 00:11:21,590
We wanted to see if you'd say "you're gonna burp?"

183
00:11:22,490 --> 00:11:24,660
Oh, eh?

184
00:11:24,660 --> 00:11:27,470
I didn't say it on purpose, it was a reflex

185
00:11:27,600 --> 00:11:30,470
If this was real it'd be bad

186
00:11:30,470 --> 00:11:33,130
I really said it by accident

187
00:11:33,800 --> 00:11:37,440
So, the next target is

188
00:11:37,440 --> 00:11:40,830
Toshikazu Miura

189
00:11:40,830 --> 00:11:46,180
What is the situation this time that will encourage him to say "you're gonna do it?"

190
00:11:47,490 --> 00:11:50,660
A flash mob marriage proposal

191
00:11:51,620 --> 00:12:00,300
This time there will be a flash mob of women sitting on chairs in this open square

192
00:12:00,880 --> 00:12:03,940
The propsal will be made by

193
00:12:03,940 --> 00:12:08,810
A seemingly unconnected person

194
00:12:23,620 --> 00:12:25,860
So, the "surprise proposal" has begun

195
00:12:25,860 --> 00:12:27,190
I'm Toshio

196
00:12:27,900 --> 00:12:32,600
As you can see, the fake show is shot from the beginning

197
00:12:33,270 --> 00:12:35,980
Then, on site

198
00:12:39,870 --> 00:12:41,790
Music seems very appropriate

199
00:12:46,460 --> 00:12:49,610
Without further ado, the flash mob starts

200
00:12:52,820 --> 00:12:54,150
Ah, here we go

201
00:12:56,400 --> 00:12:58,820
Not bad. Which one is the boyfriend? Not here yet?

202
00:12:59,790 --> 00:13:05,960
At this point, Toshio is watching in the car

203
00:13:05,960 --> 00:13:09,700
And the scene suddenly shifts at the end

204
00:13:09,700 --> 00:13:14,460
He will witness the moment first hand

205
00:13:15,890 --> 00:13:19,440
You still don't understand the situation, do you?

206
00:13:19,840 --> 00:13:20,880
Hasn't figured it out yet

207
00:13:20,880 --> 00:13:22,980
Thinking "what's this? It's great"

208
00:13:30,590 --> 00:13:32,990
Oh, the number of people has increased

209
00:13:36,890 --> 00:13:40,000
Where's the boyfriend? Hasn't made an appearance yet?

210
00:13:40,000 --> 00:13:42,430
Such a long lead up

211
00:13:43,130 --> 00:13:45,180
Then at this point

212
00:13:52,050 --> 00:13:53,420
Boyfriend-type

213
00:13:55,130 --> 00:13:59,760
Finally someone with the aura of an important person comes into view

214
00:14:00,410 --> 00:14:01,870
So

215
00:14:02,910 --> 00:14:06,420
Ah this one? Boyfriend? This is the guy, right?

216
00:14:07,300 --> 00:14:10,160
Toshio is led correctly

217
00:14:10,160 --> 00:14:13,800
So, the verification is setup perfectly

218
00:14:14,740 --> 00:14:19,450
At the moment when the flash mob was approaching its climax

219
00:14:20,470 --> 00:14:22,670
The scene comes to its conclusion

220
00:14:23,810 --> 00:14:25,440
Why do I feel so nervous?

221
00:14:28,750 --> 00:14:30,510
Hello

222
00:14:30,060 --> 00:14:31,550
So embarrassing

223
00:14:32,420 --> 00:14:33,080
Good afternoon

224
00:14:36,380 --> 00:14:38,560
Must think it is the right person

225
00:14:44,150 --> 00:14:45,800
The result?

226
00:14:59,980 --> 00:15:01,110
Hmm?

227
00:15:05,550 --> 00:15:06,300
Wait...

228
00:15:07,450 --> 00:15:08,220
No...

229
00:15:08,220 --> 00:15:09,820
Eh?

230
00:15:11,270 --> 00:15:13,530
Couldn't say it

231
00:15:17,560 --> 00:15:19,000
Eh...

232
00:15:19,000 --> 00:15:22,530
I will make you happy all your life

233
00:15:22,730 --> 00:15:23,970
Is it this one?

234
00:15:23,970 --> 00:15:26,940
Please marry me

235
00:15:27,770 --> 00:15:28,110
Ok

236
00:15:28,110 --> 00:15:30,410
Eh? Is it supposed to be this guy?

237
00:15:32,340 --> 00:15:33,610
Hang on

238
00:15:33,610 --> 00:15:34,350
Hey hey hey

239
00:15:34,350 --> 00:15:35,810
Wait, wait, wait, wait!

240
00:15:35,810 --> 00:15:37,210
I'm so confused

241
00:15:37,210 --> 00:15:38,480
Eh? Is he your boyfriend?

242
00:15:38,480 --> 00:15:41,420
Yes, he is.
-He's your boyfriend?

243
00:15:42,420 --> 00:15:43,220
It's you?

244
00:15:45,260 --> 00:15:46,720
Eh...

245
00:15:46,720 --> 00:15:48,330
Not you? No, no, wait

246
00:15:48,790 --> 00:15:50,700
Hey!

247
00:15:52,100 --> 00:15:54,300
Really?

248
00:15:54,020 --> 00:15:55,300
Questioning him non-stop

249
00:15:57,540 --> 00:15:58,170
Hoooâ€”

250
00:15:58,170 --> 00:15:59,840
No, it's not the time to make a scene

251
00:15:59,840 --> 00:16:00,970
It's not the time to make a scene

252
00:16:01,340 --> 00:16:02,110
No, no... this...

253
00:16:02,110 --> 00:16:05,340
Congratulations to both of you!

254
00:16:05,540 --> 00:16:07,140
I thought he was the boyfriend

255
00:16:07,140 --> 00:16:09,880
I was watching him the whole time

256
00:16:09,880 --> 00:16:10,880
It turned out to be you, right?

257
00:16:12,470 --> 00:16:16,350
Although he made some comments

258
00:16:16,350 --> 00:16:20,390
He didn't say "you're gonna do it?"

259
00:16:19,280 --> 00:16:20,820
Difficult

260
00:16:21,350 --> 00:16:23,050
So, we reveal the truth

261
00:16:23,230 --> 00:16:24,160
Thank you for your hard work

262
00:16:24,160 --> 00:16:25,780
Thank you for your hard work

263
00:16:25,780 --> 00:16:27,570
So close. What happened?

264
00:16:27,770 --> 00:16:30,670
This is Wednesday Downtown

265
00:16:30,670 --> 00:16:32,440
Eh, really?

266
00:16:32,440 --> 00:16:36,140
Wednesday Downtown?

267
00:16:36,140 --> 00:16:37,070
Just this?

268
00:16:37,070 --> 00:16:38,780
What is this... what is it?

269
00:16:38,780 --> 00:16:40,310
Is it a test of some theory?
-Yes

270
00:16:40,310 --> 00:16:43,250
If you're a tsukkomi, you'll say "you're gonna do it?"

271
00:16:43,250 --> 00:16:45,950
Ah, a test of whether you'll do it or not

272
00:16:45,950 --> 00:16:48,950
Whether you'll do it straight away

273
00:16:48,950 --> 00:16:51,320
No, no, this is too...

274
00:16:51,520 --> 00:16:53,790
The word "you!?" was stuck in my throat

275
00:16:53,790 --> 00:16:56,790
But I wasn't sure whether it was ok or not...

276
00:16:56,790 --> 00:16:58,580
Eh~

277
00:16:59,030 --> 00:17:01,270
I want to do it again...

278
00:17:01,270 --> 00:17:03,150
I really wanna hit them with it without thinking

279
00:17:03,150 --> 00:17:06,070
"You're gonna do it?" like that

280
00:17:06,770 --> 00:17:12,370
The last target is

281
00:17:12,370 --> 00:17:14,850
Viking's Kotouge

282
00:17:14,850 --> 00:17:16,900
The key word is

283
00:17:16,900 --> 00:17:21,090
You're gonna jump?

284
00:17:21,090 --> 00:17:28,170
When bungee jumping, after the countdown

285
00:17:28,170 --> 00:17:31,930
The staff will jump instead

286
00:17:32,230 --> 00:17:33,760
You'd think it was an accident

287
00:17:33,950 --> 00:17:36,200
Really would

288
00:17:36,470 --> 00:17:37,800
Hello, I'm Viking's Kotouge

289
00:17:38,140 --> 00:17:40,070
What a beautiful day!

290
00:17:40,070 --> 00:17:42,070
Recording on a sunny day

291
00:17:42,540 --> 00:17:45,960
As you can see, a fake program was used to take Kotouge to Gunma Prefecture

292
00:17:45,960 --> 00:17:51,270
To ensure he doesn't realize, we shoot him wandering outside for 1 hour

293
00:17:50,310 --> 00:17:51,800
He's doing it very seriously

294
00:17:51,320 --> 00:17:52,020
Tasty

295
00:17:52,120 --> 00:17:55,520
Next is the famous thing in Minakami-cho, the bungee jump

296
00:17:55,520 --> 00:17:56,920
Eh~

297
00:17:56,920 --> 00:17:57,920
No no...

298
00:17:57,920 --> 00:18:00,510
I don't want to! It's awful!

299
00:18:00,790 --> 00:18:02,890
When you are young, you are not afraid of this sort of thing

300
00:18:02,890 --> 00:18:06,800
As I get older, I get more and more afraid

301
00:18:06,970 --> 00:18:08,130
Starting to get scared now

302
00:18:08,130 --> 00:18:10,500
Since I became an old man i've become afraid

303
00:18:10,900 --> 00:18:13,620
A very noticeable emotional plunge

304
00:18:14,300 --> 00:18:17,630
We won't actually make Kotouge jump

305
00:18:18,430 --> 00:18:22,500
But we still lead him to the 42m high bungee jumping platform

306
00:18:22,680 --> 00:18:25,020
Whoooo

307
00:18:25,020 --> 00:18:27,420
I can't do this, I can't jump!

308
00:18:27,590 --> 00:18:29,620
So scary, I can't do this

309
00:18:29,620 --> 00:18:31,890
It's a no go

310
00:18:31,950 --> 00:18:33,820
Bungee is a no go

311
00:18:33,820 --> 00:18:36,160
I really can't do this

312
00:18:36,330 --> 00:18:37,590
This is really impossible

313
00:18:37,590 --> 00:18:40,980
As Kotouge is gripped by fear

314
00:18:41,930 --> 00:18:46,080
The final useless preparations are made

315
00:18:46,640 --> 00:18:48,040
Can you stand up?

316
00:18:48,040 --> 00:18:50,040
Oh wow this is really impossible

317
00:18:51,920 --> 00:18:54,990
Ah so scary, oh, wow

318
00:18:55,050 --> 00:18:55,970
So scary!

319
00:18:56,600 --> 00:18:59,920
Finally, it's time to bungee jump

320
00:18:59,920 --> 00:19:01,520
That... although I can

321
00:19:02,020 --> 00:19:04,090
But this is the last time

322
00:19:04,090 --> 00:19:05,020
Last bungee

323
00:19:05,730 --> 00:19:10,690
Will Kotogue say "you're gonna jump?"

324
00:19:10,900 --> 00:19:12,600
So, let's get started

325
00:19:12,600 --> 00:19:14,100
Countdown

326
00:19:14,100 --> 00:19:21,520
10 9 8 7 6 5 4 3

327
00:19:21,520 --> 00:19:27,850
Whoa!

328
00:19:27,580 --> 00:19:29,840
You'd react like that

329
00:19:33,170 --> 00:19:36,090
Simply not the time to comment

330
00:19:39,620 --> 00:19:45,460
His reaction is the same as if he jumped down himself

331
00:19:49,240 --> 00:19:53,350
This is more like an accident

332
00:20:00,340 --> 00:20:02,780
Jumped yourself

333
00:20:02,780 --> 00:20:04,620
Jumped yourself

334
00:20:05,470 --> 00:20:08,750
Eventually, he commented

335
00:20:08,750 --> 00:20:12,000
However, it's not "you're gonna jump?"

336
00:20:10,920 --> 00:20:12,700
Its too abnormal

337
00:20:12,090 --> 00:20:13,860
Jumped yourself

338
00:20:14,500 --> 00:20:17,390
So, we revealed the truth

339
00:20:17,800 --> 00:20:19,800
Thank you for your hard work

340
00:20:22,000 --> 00:20:23,630
Thank you for your hard work

341
00:20:24,800 --> 00:20:26,870
Wed?

342
00:20:26,870 --> 00:20:27,940
Wed?
-Correct

343
00:20:27,940 --> 00:20:29,340
Wed?

344
00:20:29,340 --> 00:20:31,510
It was Wed all along...

345
00:20:31,710 --> 00:20:36,410
If you're a tsukkomi, you'd immediately say "you're gonna jump?"

346
00:20:36,410 --> 00:20:38,250
No way no way

347
00:20:38,250 --> 00:20:40,780
Absolutely no way

348
00:20:40,780 --> 00:20:42,290
No way

349
00:20:41,160 --> 00:20:42,850
Looks so happy

350
00:20:42,290 --> 00:20:44,040
No, no, no, no

351
00:20:44,360 --> 00:20:46,690
No way I can say "you're gonna jump?"

352
00:20:46,890 --> 00:20:49,330
The fear is way too dominant

353
00:20:49,330 --> 00:20:53,600
If I was in a more normal mental state

354
00:20:53,600 --> 00:20:54,700
Maybe i'd say it

355
00:20:54,700 --> 00:20:58,270
On this occasion i'm just engulfed by fear

356
00:20:58,270 --> 00:20:59,540
It's impossible to say it

357
00:21:00,940 --> 00:21:02,470
Now I know I don't have to jump

358
00:21:02,470 --> 00:21:04,780
I'm super happy!

359
00:21:04,780 --> 00:21:06,910
My voice has gotten louder too

360
00:21:07,360 --> 00:21:12,700
In summary
It's hard to say

361
00:21:13,630 --> 00:21:19,940
Unfortunately only one person did it

362
00:21:19,940 --> 00:21:22,470
What do you think, would you be able to say it?

363
00:21:22,470 --> 00:21:26,260
At the bungee place, no way

364
00:21:26,260 --> 00:21:29,250
You'd think someone has just died

365
00:21:30,430 --> 00:21:35,310
Only extreme people like Jinnai and Fujimoto would say it

366
00:21:35,310 --> 00:21:39,520
Normal people wont, just these two abnormal ones

367
00:21:41,350 --> 00:21:47,720
But out of all of them Jinnai's worse the most boring

368
00:21:47,760 --> 00:21:50,720
That... please do not say that directly

369
00:21:50,720 --> 00:21:52,850
Who could say such a thing?

370
00:21:53,600 --> 00:21:56,580
If it was me i'd surely say it

371
00:21:56,580 --> 00:21:59,430
Looking at each of those I kept thinking i'd say it

372
00:21:59,430 --> 00:22:01,070
I keep thinking, "I'd say it if I were you!"

373
00:22:01,070 --> 00:22:02,600
That is, all five? All of them?

374
00:22:02,600 --> 00:22:05,770
I was thinking "Again I would've said it!"

375
00:22:06,110 --> 00:22:07,230
I want to see it

376
00:22:08,900 --> 00:22:11,540
Let's welcome the next presenter

377
00:22:16,770 --> 00:22:18,810
Knights

378
00:22:20,080 --> 00:22:23,220
I'm so sorry

379
00:22:23,220 --> 00:22:23,820
What's going on?

380
00:22:23,820 --> 00:22:26,820
A towel was thrown at me by Kobori

381
00:22:27,910 --> 00:22:30,210
That's enough!

382
00:22:30,210 --> 00:22:33,620
We haven't even gotten over that yet

383
00:22:33,620 --> 00:22:34,900
So impactful

384
00:22:34,900 --> 00:22:36,440
But also thanks to the program team

385
00:22:36,440 --> 00:22:39,260
The number of customers at the Toyokan has increased.
-Is it true?

386
00:22:39,260 --> 00:22:41,090
Yes, more young people are going

387
00:22:41,090 --> 00:22:43,860
That's great.
-Great

388
00:22:43,860 --> 00:22:45,680
It's improved the scene

389
00:22:47,120 --> 00:22:50,280
A little bit of self-hatred can make the audience laugh

390
00:22:51,140 --> 00:22:53,240
Awesome.
-But their relationship hasn't changed for the better?

391
00:22:53,240 --> 00:22:55,790
The relationship is still bad, but there are laughs

392
00:22:55,790 --> 00:22:57,860
Kyomaru and Kyouhei, who are very close to each other, aren't getting any laughs

393
00:22:59,530 --> 00:23:02,890
Don't make jokes like that

394
00:23:03,110 --> 00:23:06,050
We thank them for their appearance

395
00:23:06,050 --> 00:23:09,810
This time we bring a theory about "lecturing"
-I'm scared

396
00:23:10,410 --> 00:23:14,170
Have teachers and seniors at school ever said this to you?

397
00:23:14,170 --> 00:23:17,410
"If you don't want to work then get out"

398
00:23:19,080 --> 00:23:21,330
In fact, even if someone tells you to get lost

399
00:23:21,330 --> 00:23:22,970
There's no way you'll actually walk away, right?

400
00:23:22,970 --> 00:23:24,250
It's true that you wouldn't leave

401
00:23:24,250 --> 00:23:26,420
"Get out" actually means "don't go"

402
00:23:26,420 --> 00:23:28,820
That's true

403
00:23:28,820 --> 00:23:31,620
So this time we bring the following theory

404
00:23:32,280 --> 00:23:36,580
Will anyone ever follow the "get out" statement included in a lecture?

405
00:23:38,450 --> 00:23:41,490
Got it
-That's what you'd think, right?

406
00:23:41,490 --> 00:23:44,380
"Get lost", "get out of here" etc

407
00:23:44,380 --> 00:23:46,370
And "Do you know why I am angry?"

408
00:23:46,370 --> 00:23:47,770
Obon loves to say that

409
00:23:49,260 --> 00:23:52,710
When it comes to screwing people over
-You're really almost done

410
00:23:53,350 --> 00:23:55,570
No mention of a disbandment at all, but just angry

411
00:23:56,070 --> 00:23:58,050
Is it going to be replayed again?

412
00:23:58,100 --> 00:23:59,930
We are not here to replay it

413
00:23:59,930 --> 00:24:01,650
We've brought a new theory

414
00:24:03,020 --> 00:24:08,910
Will anyone ever follow the "get out" statement included in a lecture?

415
00:24:10,650 --> 00:24:16,400
This time, we asked four artists who are kind and not angry types

416
00:24:16,400 --> 00:24:19,250
Competition who can use the shortest time to force back the whole target

417
00:24:20,340 --> 00:24:23,850
Lecture Elimination Contest

418
00:24:25,040 --> 00:24:27,350
The first challenger is

419
00:24:29,090 --> 00:24:30,630
Nana Suzuki

420
00:24:29,850 --> 00:24:32,430
She's not the angry type

421
00:24:33,280 --> 00:24:34,590
Good morning
-Good morning

422
00:24:34,590 --> 00:24:36,120
Good morning

423
00:24:36,140 --> 00:24:39,100
The junior about to be lectured is

424
00:24:39,850 --> 00:24:41,360
What to drink, what to drink

425
00:24:43,520 --> 00:24:46,480
Nishino Miki

426
00:24:47,430 --> 00:24:50,070
I have a simple question

427
00:24:50,070 --> 00:24:52,900
Very puzzled
-What's wrong?

428
00:24:53,200 --> 00:24:59,310
After doing a number one in the toilet, do you wipe from the front or back

429
00:24:58,420 --> 00:24:59,960
What is she talking about?

430
00:25:01,750 --> 00:25:02,850
From the back.
-Yes, from the back

431
00:25:02,850 --> 00:25:04,010
I am also from the back

432
00:25:04,010 --> 00:25:05,480
Will anyone do it from the front?

433
00:25:05,750 --> 00:25:08,350
I've called about 10 people and asked them

434
00:25:08,450 --> 00:25:14,590
Nine people from the back, one from the front

435
00:25:14,830 --> 00:25:18,490
It's hard to imagine that this is a lunchtime girls' gossip

436
00:25:18,540 --> 00:25:20,030
In the midst of a heated conversation

437
00:25:20,880 --> 00:25:27,780
It's finally time for Nana Suzuki, who has never been angry with her juniors, to lecture

438
00:25:28,230 --> 00:25:31,380
But I think you are quite powerful, you're often on TV

439
00:25:31,380 --> 00:25:32,480
Working hard

440
00:25:32,610 --> 00:25:35,880
But actually not

441
00:25:36,710 --> 00:25:39,180
I also often search myself online
-Really?

442
00:25:39,180 --> 00:25:41,920
I search a lot

443
00:25:41,920 --> 00:25:46,960
The search results for Nishino Miki are all "super similar to Suzuki Nana"

444
00:25:47,290 --> 00:25:50,090
"Super similar" or something like that

445
00:25:49,090 --> 00:25:50,430
It's starting to get a little scary

446
00:25:51,430 --> 00:25:54,340
This really makes me stressed out

447
00:25:55,300 --> 00:25:58,170
Ah, stress?

448
00:25:59,940 --> 00:26:02,340
Body movements too

449
00:26:03,370 --> 00:26:06,680
I hope you won't talk like that again

450
00:26:06,680 --> 00:26:09,650
No way... you mean me?

451
00:26:11,800 --> 00:26:15,230
She asks the other to change her persona

452
00:26:15,230 --> 00:26:18,020
This far-fetched excuse is used to start the lecture

453
00:26:18,820 --> 00:26:22,630
I often gesture a lot when I speak

454
00:26:22,630 --> 00:26:28,930
It's what i'm known for

455
00:26:31,460 --> 00:26:33,900
So I hope that when you are on TV in the future

456
00:26:33,900 --> 00:26:35,970
Don't make hand gestures

457
00:26:35,060 --> 00:26:36,370
So scary

458
00:26:36,370 --> 00:26:38,810
It's scary to be told that

459
00:26:38,810 --> 00:26:40,260
It's painful, isn't it?

460
00:26:40,260 --> 00:26:42,750
Don't...

461
00:26:43,540 --> 00:26:47,860
Nishino is hesitant to let her claim this privilege which is not a privilege

462
00:26:48,520 --> 00:26:53,460
Next time you're on TV, don't make hand gestures

463
00:26:53,460 --> 00:26:56,490
And don't let people say you look like Suzuki Nana. Can you do that?

464
00:26:57,820 --> 00:27:00,910
Well...

465
00:26:59,080 --> 00:27:00,970
Is there an answer for this?

466
00:27:03,090 --> 00:27:04,420
It is very difficult

467
00:27:03,230 --> 00:27:06,970
But... I don't do it purposely

468
00:27:07,140 --> 00:27:08,740
If you don't understand what I mean you can leave now

469
00:27:10,870 --> 00:27:15,810
That... I can't leave

470
00:27:14,120 --> 00:27:15,810
Scary enough

471
00:27:15,810 --> 00:27:19,180
But you don't understand me at all!
-No, I understand everything

472
00:27:19,490 --> 00:27:21,550
Sitting still is also a bit difficult to do

473
00:27:22,110 --> 00:27:25,680
At this point, the first "get out" is sent out a little early

474
00:27:25,780 --> 00:27:27,190
Is she proficient

475
00:27:27,190 --> 00:27:29,760
Seems like she's used to it

476
00:27:30,370 --> 00:27:34,320
But the junior Nishino will not go so easily

477
00:27:34,770 --> 00:27:37,000
If you don't understand, get out!

478
00:27:37,000 --> 00:27:38,070
Get out now

479
00:27:38,940 --> 00:27:41,810
How can I change it?

480
00:27:40,770 --> 00:27:42,440
Feels like she has a lot of anger

481
00:27:42,310 --> 00:27:43,570
I will try...

482
00:27:43,570 --> 00:27:45,740
Just wear handcuffs on TV, isn't that good?

483
00:27:46,280 --> 00:27:47,680
Wearing handcuffs on TV...

484
00:27:47,680 --> 00:27:49,510
That way you can't make gestures

485
00:27:49,510 --> 00:27:51,280
Hand gestures are not possible

486
00:27:50,050 --> 00:27:51,330
Amazing

487
00:27:51,280 --> 00:27:53,920
But then I won't get screentime

488
00:27:53,950 --> 00:27:55,100
It's true that it can't be broadcast

489
00:27:55,290 --> 00:27:56,650
I really did not mean to imitate you

490
00:27:57,460 --> 00:27:58,560
Just unconsciously

491
00:27:58,890 --> 00:28:00,590
No hand gestures now either

492
00:28:00,620 --> 00:28:03,060
Ah, sorry

493
00:28:02,130 --> 00:28:04,160
No hand gestures allowed

494
00:28:04,160 --> 00:28:05,000
Yes

495
00:28:04,700 --> 00:28:06,160
Now go or get handcuffed

496
00:28:06,830 --> 00:28:08,900
Go or get handcuffed?

497
00:28:09,410 --> 00:28:14,790
At this point, the ultimate choice of "leaving" or "handcuffs" is presented

498
00:28:15,090 --> 00:28:17,070
Not moving at all

499
00:28:17,970 --> 00:28:20,850
Staring blankly!

500
00:28:20,850 --> 00:28:22,370
What to do?
-No, no, no

501
00:28:22,990 --> 00:28:24,440
Go or handcuffs

502
00:28:23,650 --> 00:28:27,440
Next, a silent showdown

503
00:28:27,440 --> 00:28:28,690
She lasted so long

504
00:28:28,690 --> 00:28:30,620
It's been five minutes

505
00:28:30,620 --> 00:28:32,850
Super scary

506
00:28:34,290 --> 00:28:36,090
Okay, I'll go

507
00:28:37,260 --> 00:28:39,200
Seriously, go

508
00:28:40,030 --> 00:28:42,970
Really, go now
-Ok

509
00:28:42,910 --> 00:28:44,210
Wait, really?

510
00:28:44,210 --> 00:28:45,640
Are you okay?

511
00:28:45,640 --> 00:28:46,920
It's scary, right?

512
00:28:48,540 --> 00:28:50,240
Get out of here!
-That...

513
00:28:51,040 --> 00:28:53,840
Get out of here!

514
00:28:53,260 --> 00:28:53,840
Awful!

515
00:28:54,340 --> 00:28:55,170
Scary as hell!

516
00:28:55,170 --> 00:28:57,010
Way too scary

517
00:28:57,330 --> 00:29:00,120
It's really too scary, Nana-chan...
-It's awful

518
00:29:00,880 --> 00:29:03,250
Get the hell out of here!

519
00:29:03,250 --> 00:29:07,120
Get out of here!

520
00:29:07,680 --> 00:29:12,360
So, Suzuki Nana ended at 6 minutes and 24 seconds

521
00:29:13,330 --> 00:29:14,960
Here we revealed the truth

522
00:29:14,960 --> 00:29:16,900
Poor thing

523
00:29:17,200 --> 00:29:19,170
Why's she escaping?

524
00:29:17,370 --> 00:29:19,800
What's up?

525
00:29:20,320 --> 00:29:21,810
We're on the same side

526
00:29:23,120 --> 00:29:26,720
Nishino, who hadn't fully understood the situation, returned to Suzuki's side

527
00:29:26,720 --> 00:29:29,300
What's going on?

528
00:29:29,410 --> 00:29:32,350
Really scared me.
-Why?

529
00:29:32,480 --> 00:29:35,690
I thought i'd been cursed

530
00:29:36,030 --> 00:29:38,280
Possessed by an evil spirit

531
00:29:38,320 --> 00:29:40,790
It's fake, not real

532
00:29:40,990 --> 00:29:44,660
I thought that if I left, we would never see each other again

533
00:29:44,660 --> 00:29:46,500
Goodbye forever

534
00:29:46,500 --> 00:29:47,800
So happy. Thank you

535
00:29:49,170 --> 00:29:50,430
Great!

536
00:29:50,430 --> 00:29:52,570
I'm really scared to death

537
00:29:50,980 --> 00:29:52,060
Still afraid

538
00:29:52,080 --> 00:29:55,130
Real feelings

539
00:29:53,380 --> 00:29:56,220
The next target is

540
00:29:57,950 --> 00:30:00,000
Viking's Nishimura

541
00:30:01,440 --> 00:30:03,040
Confident?

542
00:30:03,040 --> 00:30:04,970
How can I say it? I am a person who

543
00:30:04,970 --> 00:30:10,690
First of all, I don't lecture juniors

544
00:30:10,690 --> 00:30:14,890
Never get angry either

545
00:30:15,090 --> 00:30:17,830
By the way, have you ever been told to "get out"?

546
00:30:17,830 --> 00:30:19,560
I have before

547
00:30:19,560 --> 00:30:21,360
When was it?

548
00:30:21,360 --> 00:30:23,930
A manager gave me his card

549
00:30:23,970 --> 00:30:28,040
When I was given it I said "ok, i'll pay with this"

550
00:30:28,040 --> 00:30:31,580
Then I put four or five rounds on the card

551
00:30:31,580 --> 00:30:35,280
The next day, after he found out, I was told to get out

552
00:30:35,280 --> 00:30:38,280
Did you really leave?
-I left

553
00:30:38,720 --> 00:30:42,380
The kind of man who will walk away on demand

554
00:30:43,730 --> 00:30:47,140
Can he get others to flee or not?

555
00:30:47,790 --> 00:30:51,290
A public performance

556
00:30:51,290 --> 00:30:54,500
can get 50,000 or 60,000 at that time.
-Great

557
00:30:54,800 --> 00:30:56,600
But that's about it. It's only on occasion

558
00:30:56,600 --> 00:31:00,400
Before King of Conte I got 40,000 at most

559
00:31:00,400 --> 00:31:04,170
Ah, i've taken over then

560
00:31:04,960 --> 00:31:07,990
They tentatively have a casual conversation

561
00:31:08,810 --> 00:31:13,280
One pork hot pot, please

562
00:31:13,280 --> 00:31:14,990
Is it for two people?
-Yes

563
00:31:14,990 --> 00:31:18,150
Ok then

564
00:31:18,790 --> 00:31:23,440
After the clerk leaves, the lecture begins

565
00:31:26,330 --> 00:31:27,830
What did you order?

566
00:31:28,130 --> 00:31:29,730
Ordered hot pot

567
00:31:29,730 --> 00:31:31,740
Hot pot?

568
00:31:31,900 --> 00:31:34,100
Hot pot?

569
00:31:34,100 --> 00:31:35,140
Hot pot?

570
00:31:34,820 --> 00:31:35,730
Is this ok?

571
00:31:35,540 --> 00:31:37,710
Yes

572
00:31:35,730 --> 00:31:38,260
No way, why would you be angry about this?

573
00:31:38,910 --> 00:31:40,540
Hot pot?

574
00:31:41,210 --> 00:31:42,550
Yes...

575
00:31:41,430 --> 00:31:42,340
Clearly heard it at the time

576
00:31:42,780 --> 00:31:44,880
How many servings?

577
00:31:44,880 --> 00:31:46,120
For two

578
00:31:46,120 --> 00:31:48,120
Are you looking down on me?

579
00:31:47,140 --> 00:31:48,210
Why?

580
00:31:50,120 --> 00:31:52,830
Too weird

581
00:31:50,690 --> 00:31:54,420
With the Hot pot order as the first issue

582
00:31:55,220 --> 00:31:57,860
Nishimura devises a fascinating setting

583
00:31:57,860 --> 00:32:01,140
A taste minefield

584
00:32:01,770 --> 00:32:04,430
You can't get it right!

585
00:32:04,670 --> 00:32:05,100
This...

586
00:32:05,100 --> 00:32:07,540
You should understand!

587
00:32:07,970 --> 00:32:11,010
You just don't get it
-I'm sorry

588
00:32:09,210 --> 00:32:11,280
It sucks

589
00:32:11,010 --> 00:32:13,580
Enough, you can go for today

590
00:32:14,910 --> 00:32:15,980
I'm sorry

591
00:32:16,920 --> 00:32:19,950
Here the "get out" is launched

592
00:32:19,950 --> 00:32:21,410
It's impossible, right?

593
00:32:22,420 --> 00:32:23,620
Sorry

594
00:32:23,620 --> 00:32:26,420
All right, just get out

595
00:32:27,560 --> 00:32:30,290
Did you order hot pot?
-Yes, I did

596
00:32:30,290 --> 00:32:34,660
Then get out of here.
-I'm sorry

597
00:32:34,660 --> 00:32:37,230
It's too uninspiring

598
00:32:36,030 --> 00:32:38,520
You have to eat alone if he leaves

599
00:32:37,230 --> 00:32:38,400
Sorry

600
00:32:38,400 --> 00:32:41,970
I think this is more balanced

601
00:32:42,070 --> 00:32:45,240
What the hell is hot pot, you!

602
00:32:45,240 --> 00:32:46,940
Sukiyaki is more like it

603
00:32:47,180 --> 00:32:49,580
Why order hot pot?

604
00:32:50,610 --> 00:32:53,580
It's impossible to order hot pot normally

605
00:32:53,580 --> 00:32:55,650
Hot pot...sorry
-Get out

606
00:32:56,890 --> 00:33:00,660
I'm sorry, I was wrong

607
00:33:00,660 --> 00:33:02,590
Please don't make me go

608
00:33:02,830 --> 00:33:06,160
No, you're really off the mark

609
00:33:06,360 --> 00:33:07,860
It's obviously you, right?

610
00:33:08,000 --> 00:33:10,400
This is the Achilles heel of comedians

611
00:33:10,400 --> 00:33:12,670
What kind of hot pot did you order?

612
00:33:12,670 --> 00:33:14,040
It should be Sukiyaki!

613
00:33:14,340 --> 00:33:18,290
The correct answer is neither hot pot nor sukiyaki

614
00:33:18,290 --> 00:33:22,800
But the off-the-mark Nishimura is at least interesting as a comedian

615
00:33:23,460 --> 00:33:24,450
Even so

616
00:33:24,680 --> 00:33:28,250
What are the vegetables in sukiyaki and hot pot?

617
00:33:28,420 --> 00:33:30,620
First, Sukiyaki

618
00:33:30,620 --> 00:33:33,590
Chrysanthemum
-Mmmm

619
00:33:33,590 --> 00:33:35,390
Cabbage
-Mmm

620
00:33:35,730 --> 00:33:38,400
Carrot
-Mmm

621
00:33:38,400 --> 00:33:41,260
Konjaku
-Konjaku is not a vegetable

622
00:33:41,770 --> 00:33:44,070
You should really get out of here

623
00:33:44,070 --> 00:33:48,510
Why can't you read out the vegetables in sukiyaki?

624
00:33:48,510 --> 00:33:49,770
There are many more

625
00:33:49,770 --> 00:33:50,570
Onion

626
00:33:50,570 --> 00:33:53,280
Uh-huh. Onions are perfect.
-Yes

627
00:33:54,280 --> 00:33:56,250
You should really get out of here.
-Sorry, sorry

628
00:33:56,250 --> 00:33:57,510
Sincerely get out!

629
00:33:57,510 --> 00:34:01,320
You can't even tell me the ingredients of sukiyaki, you're not even close to being good enough.
-I'm sorry

630
00:34:01,950 --> 00:34:05,920
Sukiyaki has much higher status than shabu-shabu
-Yes

631
00:34:05,920 --> 00:34:07,460
I'll remember

632
00:34:07,460 --> 00:34:09,090
Why don't you just get out?

633
00:34:10,760 --> 00:34:13,000
Seriously, really need to get out of here.
-Okay

634
00:34:13,000 --> 00:34:15,500
If you don't understand this...
-I'll go

635
00:34:15,670 --> 00:34:20,570
What can I do?
-Sorry, this guy won't leave

636
00:34:20,570 --> 00:34:24,170
Please get him out of here
-Shall I make him go away?

637
00:34:24,170 --> 00:34:25,880
Please get him out of here

638
00:34:28,210 --> 00:34:29,580
Sorry, I'll leave now

639
00:34:29,580 --> 00:34:31,310
Miss, I'm sorry. It's okay

640
00:34:31,820 --> 00:34:36,520
Miss, please take him out

641
00:34:36,520 --> 00:34:37,720
Get him out of here

642
00:34:37,720 --> 00:34:40,290
I'll go by myself. It's fine

643
00:34:40,290 --> 00:34:42,560
You should really get out of here.
-I'm sorry. I get it

644
00:34:42,560 --> 00:34:44,930
Get the hell out of here!
-I'm so sorry

645
00:34:45,380 --> 00:34:49,250
Using the rough trick of getting the staff's help

646
00:34:49,250 --> 00:34:52,720
Nishimura achieves success after 12 minutes 38 seconds

647
00:34:51,640 --> 00:34:53,810
Don't cause others trouble!

648
00:34:54,380 --> 00:34:56,660
The next challenger is

649
00:34:56,660 --> 00:35:00,800
Panther's Ogata

650
00:35:01,520 --> 00:35:03,040
The target is

651
00:35:04,700 --> 00:35:05,770
Ah, it's Takashi

652
00:35:04,710 --> 00:35:06,150
Just the two of us?

653
00:35:08,740 --> 00:35:11,140
Trendy Angel's Takashi

654
00:35:12,500 --> 00:35:15,530
As the presenter you should have done it yourselves

655
00:35:15,700 --> 00:35:17,950
But after watching the VTR just now

656
00:35:17,950 --> 00:35:21,050
For authenticity, Obon Kobon would be better

657
00:35:21,320 --> 00:35:22,730
Get out!

658
00:35:23,340 --> 00:35:24,880
Get out of here!
It's happened!

659
00:35:25,770 --> 00:35:29,640
Next is Panther's Ogata

660
00:35:29,640 --> 00:35:30,740
But

661
00:35:30,740 --> 00:35:35,350
I've never met an Ogata fan

662
00:35:36,780 --> 00:35:38,410
That's not right, there are some

663
00:35:38,850 --> 00:35:41,650
Ogata fans don't exist, right?
-They do

664
00:35:42,090 --> 00:35:45,850
He mistakenly chose a junior who is used to messing around

665
00:35:46,460 --> 00:35:48,670
Making it difficult to start the lecture

666
00:35:50,680 --> 00:35:56,030
However, after an hour, finally

667
00:35:58,540 --> 00:36:05,740
My child. You held her when you came to my house

668
00:36:08,110 --> 00:36:10,250
Didn't you feel her up?

669
00:36:10,060 --> 00:36:11,160
So disgusting!

670
00:36:12,450 --> 00:36:15,390
When holding her

671
00:36:14,830 --> 00:36:16,800
That's disgusting

672
00:36:15,690 --> 00:36:17,490
I just held her normally

673
00:36:18,760 --> 00:36:20,960
So you did!

674
00:36:20,530 --> 00:36:22,110
A bad vibe

675
00:36:21,790 --> 00:36:24,270
Due to struggling to find a point to lecture on

676
00:36:24,270 --> 00:36:28,410
Ogata becomes angry for no reason

677
00:36:28,410 --> 00:36:30,180
Impressive

678
00:36:29,830 --> 00:36:33,940
Your persona is that type

679
00:36:35,170 --> 00:36:38,810
I hope you can pay attention to how you make contact

680
00:36:40,100 --> 00:36:41,390
Not listening at all

681
00:36:40,440 --> 00:36:44,010
But everyone would do it in this way
-They wouldn't!

682
00:36:45,450 --> 00:36:47,750
Okay, okay, get out

683
00:36:49,490 --> 00:36:51,220
I'll leave later

684
00:36:51,220 --> 00:36:53,220
It's not a matter of a when

685
00:36:53,620 --> 00:36:56,560
I told you to go now.
-In a bit

686
00:36:56,560 --> 00:37:00,300
What? Are you t underestimating me? Sitting their vaping

687
00:37:00,300 --> 00:37:02,100
I am now really angry

688
00:37:02,800 --> 00:37:04,430
Sorry

689
00:37:04,430 --> 00:37:06,670
Saying sorry but still smoking?

690
00:37:08,840 --> 00:37:11,210
No smoking

691
00:37:11,740 --> 00:37:14,680
You get out of here, I'm really in a bad mood

692
00:37:15,220 --> 00:37:16,870
But after that

693
00:37:19,780 --> 00:37:21,450
No drinking

694
00:37:24,150 --> 00:37:25,860
You are completely ignoring me

695
00:37:25,860 --> 00:37:29,260
I am 41 years old, how old are you?
How old are you?  -33

696
00:37:29,260 --> 00:37:31,160
33 years old

697
00:37:31,160 --> 00:37:32,130
You're not taking me seriously

698
00:37:33,330 --> 00:37:35,230
No drinking

699
00:37:36,230 --> 00:37:39,570
I'm 8 years older than you

700
00:37:40,000 --> 00:37:43,070
But I was born earlier in the month
-That has nothing to do with anything, okay!?

701
00:37:43,590 --> 00:37:48,180
The idiotic conversation went on like this for more than 15 minutes

702
00:37:48,180 --> 00:37:52,680
And Takashi eventually stands up out of boredom

703
00:37:52,350 --> 00:37:54,100
Bored

704
00:37:53,620 --> 00:37:54,850
Sorry

705
00:37:54,850 --> 00:37:57,450
Sorry for what? I can't forgive you

706
00:37:57,450 --> 00:37:59,660
Get out of here now!

707
00:38:00,140 --> 00:38:02,930
The final challenger is

708
00:38:04,110 --> 00:38:05,870
DJ KOO

709
00:38:07,100 --> 00:38:09,500
Today you'll be lecturing

710
00:38:09,500 --> 00:38:13,170
Do you usually get angry?

711
00:38:15,510 --> 00:38:19,340
I'm not very loud...loud... lou-

712
00:38:19,640 --> 00:38:21,580
You already know the content, right?

713
00:38:21,580 --> 00:38:24,580
Curry? The case of the curry department?

714
00:38:22,880 --> 00:38:25,280
Do it properly!

715
00:38:25,300 --> 00:38:32,450
The lecture is given at the Avex-Management Academy

716
00:38:32,450 --> 00:38:36,170
To Hama, a junior who starred with KOO

717
00:38:37,130 --> 00:38:41,030
Many new projects will be held in 2019

718
00:38:41,030 --> 00:38:42,170
Special events

719
00:38:43,830 --> 00:38:50,440
Have you written down a few of your ideas?

720
00:38:50,440 --> 00:38:51,410
Is it written on paper?

721
00:38:51,730 --> 00:38:53,310
Idea list

722
00:38:53,310 --> 00:38:56,510
I didn't write it down
-Why? What happened?

723
00:38:56,510 --> 00:38:59,380
Wait, wait, wait, wait a little bit!

724
00:38:59,380 --> 00:39:01,620
Wait a second

725
00:39:05,020 --> 00:39:07,190
You...
-Yes

726
00:39:08,360 --> 00:39:10,690
If you don't want to do it, don't do it

727
00:39:10,690 --> 00:39:11,530
Don't do it

728
00:39:11,530 --> 00:39:12,560
You can leave today

729
00:39:13,160 --> 00:39:15,470
Sorry, you can go now

730
00:39:15,700 --> 00:39:19,760
A sudden increase in horsepower smoothly leads to the request

731
00:39:19,760 --> 00:39:21,360
A perfect transition

732
00:39:21,170 --> 00:39:22,760
Suddenly so scary

733
00:39:21,850 --> 00:39:23,060
However

734
00:39:23,870 --> 00:39:27,480
For example, what do you think about the curry scene in the future

735
00:39:27,980 --> 00:39:29,510
Scene?

736
00:39:30,250 --> 00:39:34,450
The scene of curry. Tell me about it from your point of view

737
00:39:34,450 --> 00:39:36,190
Curry scene?
-The curry scene

738
00:39:36,190 --> 00:39:39,660
Similar to the "music scene" and "hip-hop scene"

739
00:39:39,920 --> 00:39:43,730
It's already very popular

740
00:39:44,290 --> 00:39:49,070
The curry department should make the atmosphere hotter
-Yeah

741
00:39:48,750 --> 00:39:49,840
What are you talking about?

742
00:39:52,390 --> 00:39:55,040
Where did the momentum go?

743
00:39:55,600 --> 00:39:59,090
The unaccustomed lecturing suddenly cools down

744
00:40:00,040 --> 00:40:03,110
I often go to Shimokitazawa Curry Music Festival

745
00:40:04,010 --> 00:40:06,220
Shimokitazawa Curry Music Festival...

746
00:40:06,420 --> 00:40:09,490
Very popular now

747
00:40:08,740 --> 00:40:09,720
Taking notes

748
00:40:09,490 --> 00:40:11,220
More stores than in Jimbocho

749
00:40:11,220 --> 00:40:12,560
There are more than one hundred

750
00:40:13,490 --> 00:40:16,130
This is what I want you to write about

751
00:40:16,780 --> 00:40:21,620
He's too focused on this meeting of the curry department

752
00:40:19,120 --> 00:40:20,170
What do you mean "this"?

753
00:40:22,290 --> 00:40:26,650
Seems to have completely forgotten the "get out" thing

754
00:40:26,650 --> 00:40:27,640
Even more so than

755
00:40:28,040 --> 00:40:31,440
Prepare for the start of the show 3-2-1

756
00:40:35,660 --> 00:40:37,390
What is this?

757
00:40:37,390 --> 00:40:42,020
To the point of being completely unintelligible

758
00:40:43,950 --> 00:40:45,970
So, we revealed the truth at this point

759
00:40:49,520 --> 00:40:51,130
Didn't say "get out" at all

760
00:40:50,490 --> 00:40:52,630
KOO

761
00:40:53,560 --> 00:40:55,970
Did you forget to say "get out"?

762
00:41:00,270 --> 00:41:02,810
Ah, I see

763
00:41:03,150 --> 00:41:10,120
In conclusion, the winner of the lecture contest is Nana Suzuki

764
00:41:13,260 --> 00:41:14,610
What do you think?

765
00:41:14,610 --> 00:41:17,130
The Suzuki Nana part is too shocking

766
00:41:17,130 --> 00:41:18,220
A little too scary

767
00:41:18,220 --> 00:41:20,130
Quite impressive

768
00:41:20,130 --> 00:41:22,090
This kind of person being angry

769
00:41:22,090 --> 00:41:24,160
They really emit a different kind of terror

770
00:41:24,160 --> 00:41:25,900
It's really shocking

771
00:41:25,900 --> 00:41:33,280
Is that an act? I can't help but feel that she's actually like that

772
00:41:33,280 --> 00:41:35,810
Scary indeed

773
00:41:38,480 --> 00:41:40,540
To sum up, the lecture in the...

774
00:41:40,540 --> 00:41:44,470
That's pretty impressive. All kinds of things happened

775
00:41:45,120 --> 00:41:50,000
Very scary stuff

776
00:41:50,000 --> 00:41:56,000
I also hope that Obon Kobon will continue to work hard

777
00:41:57,530 --> 00:41:59,030
Get out of here!

778
00:41:59,160 --> 00:42:03,570
Sorry, I can't get out

779
00:42:08,210 --> 00:42:10,470
It's all over for you. Just go. It's over

780
00:42:10,770 --> 00:42:14,210
Sorry, I can't go

781
00:42:14,390 --> 00:42:16,970
So scary

782
00:42:19,650 --> 00:42:22,290
What a horrible exit

783
00:42:22,970 --> 00:42:24,450
That's it. Thank you all

784
00:42:27,570 --> 00:42:33,860
Now is everybody's theories

785
00:42:34,380 --> 00:42:36,630
Tonight's presenter is

786
00:42:38,120 --> 00:42:41,460
Kenji Tamura

787
00:42:44,820 --> 00:42:50,620
As stars, you must have all received letters from our fans, right?

788
00:42:50,830 --> 00:42:54,320
Are there any letters that are particularly impressive?

789
00:42:54,360 --> 00:42:55,250
What have you received Naomi?

790
00:42:55,550 --> 00:42:58,650
A letter written about dating me

791
00:42:58,670 --> 00:42:59,940
That we're in a relationship

792
00:43:00,180 --> 00:43:02,830
Although long-distant, he made a lot of effort

793
00:43:03,390 --> 00:43:04,630
Very daring

794
00:43:04,810 --> 00:43:08,420
He would call me and say he was sorry and all that

795
00:43:10,020 --> 00:43:11,100
He's delusional, right?

796
00:43:11,230 --> 00:43:14,310
He was carrying out this series of activities by delusions of grandeur

797
00:43:14,900 --> 00:43:16,180
And also say "I really want to see you"

798
00:43:16,180 --> 00:43:18,690
"But we can't see each other because of Yoshimoto's rules."

799
00:43:18,750 --> 00:43:20,060
So scary

800
00:43:20,080 --> 00:43:21,250
It was like that

801
00:43:21,860 --> 00:43:23,820
Have you received any strange things in the mail along with fan letters?

802
00:43:23,920 --> 00:43:26,490
I once received a seemingly ordinary letter

803
00:43:26,790 --> 00:43:29,260
It says "I'd like to be by your side to support you, but I can't."

804
00:43:29,450 --> 00:43:31,790
"That's why I'm giving it this you as my stand-in"

805
00:43:32,410 --> 00:43:33,400
Then sent a clay doll over

806
00:43:35,520 --> 00:43:38,830
The thing that guards the dead

807
00:43:39,370 --> 00:43:40,960
That should be placed around the deceased

808
00:43:41,950 --> 00:43:43,430
I thought I was still alive and well

809
00:43:44,020 --> 00:43:47,340
So, today I bring a theory about fan letters

810
00:43:47,610 --> 00:43:48,690
Please take a look

811
00:43:49,820 --> 00:43:54,420
Comedians receive memorable and creepy fan letters

812
00:43:54,650 --> 00:43:55,750
I see

813
00:43:56,590 --> 00:44:00,310
We just talked about a lot of creepy things just now

814
00:44:00,500 --> 00:44:03,600
Do you have any experiences of this? Being in the idol industry

815
00:44:04,150 --> 00:44:06,180
Because the firm checks everything in advance

816
00:44:06,370 --> 00:44:07,730
If it contains strange things...

817
00:44:07,730 --> 00:44:09,020
It will be checked in advance.
-Yes

818
00:44:09,180 --> 00:44:11,640
For example, if an address is written on it, they'll cut it out

819
00:44:11,690 --> 00:44:14,230
Or use markers to black it out, etc

820
00:44:14,560 --> 00:44:16,820
So I haven't experienced this sort of thing

821
00:44:17,100 --> 00:44:21,980
Ok, so this time we asked people from all walks of life

822
00:44:22,870 --> 00:44:25,740
And the only one with the least stringent inspection system was that of comedians

823
00:44:27,660 --> 00:44:28,740
They just get random gifts

824
00:44:28,740 --> 00:44:29,880
They're delivered in the same way

825
00:44:29,900 --> 00:44:30,830
They send anything to us

826
00:44:30,940 --> 00:44:33,950
I also received a letter that was so thick that it was strange

827
00:44:33,950 --> 00:44:41,390
Comedians receive memorable and creepy fan letters

828
00:44:42,050 --> 00:44:44,090
Creepy fan letter â‘ 

829
00:44:44,650 --> 00:44:46,970
Cookie

830
00:44:44,840 --> 00:44:45,870
You're the creepiest, right?

831
00:44:48,500 --> 00:44:51,670
What impressed me the most was

832
00:44:51,670 --> 00:44:54,740
About 3~4 years after debuting

833
00:44:54,900 --> 00:44:57,540
There was a girl who was so short it was hilarious

834
00:44:57,220 --> 00:44:58,230
So rude

835
00:44:58,110 --> 00:45:00,080
She was a brunette with hair like a doll

836
00:45:00,080 --> 00:45:02,550
The appearance was really like a Japanese doll

837
00:45:02,560 --> 00:45:03,880
But with normal clothes on

838
00:45:04,250 --> 00:45:06,320
The girl appeared suddenly

839
00:45:06,320 --> 00:45:08,820
She often came to see my show

840
00:45:08,820 --> 00:45:11,250
She had folded a thousand paper cranes

841
00:45:11,250 --> 00:45:14,790
She handed me a thousand paper cranes with a red wabi-sabi design

842
00:45:14,790 --> 00:45:18,260
Then he said to me, "Please take it"

843
00:45:18,260 --> 00:45:19,330
I then received a thousand paper cranes

844
00:45:19,700 --> 00:45:23,170
When I got home, I unfolded them

845
00:45:23,280 --> 00:45:25,600
Restored the paper to its original state

846
00:45:25,600 --> 00:45:28,970
On the reverse side of the pattern, in small letters, it read

847
00:45:28,970 --> 00:45:32,780
"I hope you will like me", written all over it

848
00:45:33,030 --> 00:45:37,810
A fan letter in the form of a thousand paper cranes

849
00:45:38,410 --> 00:45:42,450
You know how some people can write characters on a grain of rice? It was like that

850
00:45:42,450 --> 00:45:44,650
Must've used a super fine pen

851
00:45:45,170 --> 00:45:47,290
Creepy fan letter â‘¡

852
00:45:48,030 --> 00:45:49,620
Kamaitachi's Yamauchi

853
00:45:51,830 --> 00:45:54,000
I received a postcard

854
00:45:54,000 --> 00:45:57,070
I was told that "I have a fan letter for you"

855
00:45:57,070 --> 00:46:00,540
On the front, it said "To Kenji Yamauchi"

856
00:46:00,540 --> 00:46:04,010
Then on the back, "I've been watching your show on TV"

857
00:46:04,240 --> 00:46:09,180
"I support you from the bottom of my heart and look forward to hearing from you if I can."

858
00:46:09,380 --> 00:46:13,280
"I'll be looking forward to hearing from you," it read

859
00:46:13,280 --> 00:46:15,350
But the name on the front

860
00:46:15,350 --> 00:46:20,560
"Kenji Yamauchi" was written on a separate piece of paper

861
00:46:20,760 --> 00:46:22,990
I was curious about the extra bit of paper

862
00:46:22,990 --> 00:46:26,060
So I carefully pulled it off

863
00:46:26,060 --> 00:46:29,170
Underneath, it said "To Oguri Shun"

864
00:46:29,170 --> 00:46:32,570
I thought, "Why'd you give up and compromise by sending it elsewhere?"

865
00:46:32,570 --> 00:46:34,570
"This person is too determined to give up"

866
00:46:34,900 --> 00:46:39,600
A letter from a determined fan

867
00:46:39,980 --> 00:46:43,380
You'd think she'd at least rewrite it for me

868
00:46:44,070 --> 00:46:46,790
Creepy fan letter â‘¢

869
00:46:46,940 --> 00:46:48,440
Viking's Kotouge

870
00:46:48,700 --> 00:46:49,490
Sent by a man?

871
00:46:49,690 --> 00:46:51,620
Well, it was sent by a male fan

872
00:46:51,890 --> 00:46:56,690
He would wait for us at the exit after each performance

873
00:46:57,230 --> 00:47:00,130
The fan letter was written on about 7 sheets of letterheaded paper

874
00:47:00,500 --> 00:47:04,900
"Kotouge's comedy is the source of my life and vitality"

875
00:47:04,930 --> 00:47:09,270
The "Hearing your lines is like being caressed by lightning all over your body" kind of thing

876
00:47:09,270 --> 00:47:10,810
Used language like a novel

877
00:47:10,940 --> 00:47:15,280
Then with another 3 sheets of paper

878
00:47:15,280 --> 00:47:17,410
"I can't believe I just wrote 7 sheets."

879
00:47:17,600 --> 00:47:19,470
He wrote an apology letter

880
00:47:20,220 --> 00:47:23,070
Which was also included and sent in

881
00:47:23,810 --> 00:47:27,890
He came to every show for about 4~5 years

882
00:47:28,080 --> 00:47:32,150
An emotional and apologetic fan letter

883
00:47:32,920 --> 00:47:35,330
He works in an eel shop

884
00:47:35,330 --> 00:47:37,330
How do you know that?

885
00:47:37,330 --> 00:47:41,650
At the end of the letter, he wrote the address and phone number of an eel shop

886
00:47:41,760 --> 00:47:46,210
And his own cell phone number, email address and LINE ID

887
00:47:46,210 --> 00:47:48,540
He was desperately trying to convey his personal information to me

888
00:47:48,840 --> 00:47:52,110
Then once, on a day off

889
00:47:52,480 --> 00:47:54,320
I thought I'd go to this eel store

890
00:47:54,320 --> 00:47:59,790
It took about three and a half hours to drive there

891
00:47:59,790 --> 00:48:01,490
It was already late afternoon when I reached it

892
00:48:01,520 --> 00:48:05,860
I went in and found that this guy was not in because he had gone to dinner

893
00:48:06,000 --> 00:48:10,470
Then about a month later there was a show again

894
00:48:10,730 --> 00:48:13,970
I got another letter

895
00:48:13,970 --> 00:48:18,070
After reading it, I found there was a letter and something else

896
00:48:18,070 --> 00:48:20,010
He put his work schedule in there

897
00:48:20,210 --> 00:48:23,510
Why do I have to work around your schedule!?

898
00:48:23,510 --> 00:48:28,050
Rest days other than the regular Monday holidays

899
00:48:23,780 --> 00:48:30,090
Every time since then, the duty roster of that eel store has been put in the letter as a matter of course

900
00:48:30,600 --> 00:48:33,010
Creepy fan letter â‘£

901
00:48:33,660 --> 00:48:34,460
Hiroshi

902
00:48:35,690 --> 00:48:37,130
A house schematic

903
00:48:37,490 --> 00:48:40,000
A layout of 2LDK was placed inside

904
00:48:37,490 --> 00:48:41,400
â€»LDK indicates the layout of the house "L" stands for living room "D" stands for dining room "K" stands for kitchen 2LDK means two rooms and one bathroom

905
00:48:40,000 --> 00:48:41,500
A letter was in there, too, and it said

906
00:48:41,600 --> 00:48:45,830
"I rented this house to live in with Hiroshi"

907
00:48:46,000 --> 00:48:47,300
"I've already arranged a guarantor"

908
00:48:47,300 --> 00:48:49,370
Their signature and seal was on it too

909
00:48:49,640 --> 00:48:53,480
Then it said "All that's left is Hiroshi's signature and seal"

910
00:48:53,680 --> 00:48:55,910
I haven't even met her

911
00:48:56,110 --> 00:49:00,880
A fan letter describing having taken the liberty of finding a home for the both of them

912
00:48:59,190 --> 00:49:00,170
This is very similar to Naomi's

913
00:49:00,880 --> 00:49:06,590
And it also said "Please pay the rent every month"

914
00:49:07,080 --> 00:49:09,510
Creepy fan letter â‘¤

915
00:49:09,910 --> 00:49:11,440
Audrey's Kasuga

916
00:49:12,730 --> 00:49:14,800
How can I put it? What I always see is

917
00:49:14,800 --> 00:49:21,300
"I will visit you at a certain time on a certain day in a certain month, please wait for me at that time."

918
00:49:19,100 --> 00:49:20,200
His address was leaked

919
00:49:21,300 --> 00:49:25,440
I also get these fan letters that want to control my schedule

920
00:49:25,740 --> 00:49:29,280
I also received a lot of fan mail directly at my home

921
00:49:29,280 --> 00:49:31,750
Don't you get scared when this happens?

922
00:49:31,750 --> 00:49:33,950
Usually'd be scared

923
00:49:34,180 --> 00:49:36,040
But they're kind enough to warn me in advance

924
00:49:36,040 --> 00:49:37,250
I see

925
00:49:37,250 --> 00:49:39,860
But once there was no warning at all and I came home to find someone waiting for me

926
00:49:40,920 --> 00:49:44,100
For Kasuga whose address was public

927
00:49:43,530 --> 00:49:44,820
How long have you been living here?

928
00:49:44,560 --> 00:49:48,930
Not only fan letters, but also gifts were also sent to his home

929
00:49:49,730 --> 00:49:52,570
When I had a cold

930
00:49:52,570 --> 00:49:55,600
I had a lot of things piled up in front of my house, condolences and so on

931
00:49:55,800 --> 00:49:58,310
It made me feel like I was dying

932
00:49:58,310 --> 00:50:00,310
I felt like "i'm not dead yet!"

933
00:50:00,410 --> 00:50:03,580
Bouquet of flowers, drinks, and so on

934
00:50:03,770 --> 00:50:07,020
In the middle of that was a refrigerated box

935
00:50:07,020 --> 00:50:08,250
I thought "what is this?" and opened it

936
00:50:08,250 --> 00:50:11,290
There was some porridge inside

937
00:50:11,690 --> 00:50:16,230
A refrigerator full of porridge

938
00:50:13,350 --> 00:50:14,340
That's awful

939
00:50:16,840 --> 00:50:17,690
And

940
00:50:18,260 --> 00:50:21,600
Another thing was placed in front of my house

941
00:50:21,830 --> 00:50:26,000
Like a garbage bag, something big

942
00:50:26,170 --> 00:50:29,770
I thought "it's another prank or something"

943
00:50:30,410 --> 00:50:34,480
I grabbed the garbage bag and tried to remove it

944
00:50:34,480 --> 00:50:39,580
Then a hand suddenly grabbed me from below

945
00:50:39,720 --> 00:50:41,120
Inside the garbage bag...

946
00:50:41,150 --> 00:50:42,840
There was a woman

947
00:50:42,840 --> 00:50:44,890
A woman?

948
00:50:44,990 --> 00:50:49,860
A surprise appearance from a garbage bag

949
00:50:50,030 --> 00:50:53,730
I tried not to react too strongly

950
00:50:54,030 --> 00:50:56,200
I said "can you get out of the way?"

951
00:50:56,200 --> 00:51:00,040
The person said "ok, ok fine" etc

952
00:51:00,040 --> 00:51:02,970
She probably thought i'd be a little more exaggerated

953
00:51:03,480 --> 00:51:05,920
Creepy fan letter â‘¥

954
00:51:06,570 --> 00:51:08,150
Nonstyle's Inoue

955
00:51:09,480 --> 00:51:13,350
There was a letter full of how much the person liked me

956
00:51:12,340 --> 00:51:13,040
This dumb guy

957
00:51:13,350 --> 00:51:19,590
Then she said, "The students in my class don't know what's good about Inoue."

958
00:51:19,590 --> 00:51:24,660
"That's why I'm always talking about Inoue during break time or after school."

959
00:51:24,930 --> 00:51:31,000
"I desperately explained to the entire class, including the teacher" something like that

960
00:51:31,300 --> 00:51:33,470
Then I suddenly saw the next page which read

961
00:51:33,470 --> 00:51:38,540
"After doing so, I was gradually bullied by everyone."

962
00:51:38,740 --> 00:51:43,610
Fan letter expressing bullying

963
00:51:40,040 --> 00:51:40,760
Poor thing

964
00:51:44,010 --> 00:51:46,420
Creepy fan letter (7)

965
00:51:47,140 --> 00:51:50,590
Higashibukuro

966
00:51:51,590 --> 00:51:55,560
I had a scandal in the second half of 2013

967
00:51:55,560 --> 00:51:57,990
Fans were almost reduced to 0

968
00:51:57,990 --> 00:52:00,800
Basically just one person waiting for me at the exit during that time

969
00:52:01,030 --> 00:52:02,900
She gave me a letter

970
00:52:02,900 --> 00:52:03,800
But after reading it

971
00:52:03,970 --> 00:52:07,260
"Even with a scandal like that, I have a way to redeem you."

972
00:52:07,260 --> 00:52:08,870
Wrote something like

973
00:52:10,170 --> 00:52:15,540
"Ask someone for guidance, and your past will be cleansed."

974
00:52:15,540 --> 00:52:19,310
"The only way to purify all this is to enter this religion."

975
00:52:19,310 --> 00:52:22,280
And then they were persistently trying to persuade me to join the church

976
00:52:22,550 --> 00:52:25,650
What did she look like?

977
00:52:25,920 --> 00:52:29,630
Really short and with a doll's haircut

978
00:52:29,880 --> 00:52:34,630
Fan letter to strongly persuade others using mind tricks

979
00:52:31,400 --> 00:52:33,600
Is it the same person as the previous one?

980
00:52:33,720 --> 00:52:35,070
This picture is reused

981
00:52:35,230 --> 00:52:37,600
Creepy fan letter â‘§

982
00:52:35,850 --> 00:52:36,550
Really?

983
00:52:38,170 --> 00:52:39,000
No way

984
00:52:38,170 --> 00:52:39,900
Ungirls' Tanaka

985
00:52:40,540 --> 00:52:45,740
I said something like I have 100 million in savings on a TV show

986
00:52:45,970 --> 00:52:49,040
Got fan letters like "Can you lend me 2 million"

987
00:52:49,550 --> 00:52:53,980
Fan letter with Tanaka's cash in mind

988
00:52:54,280 --> 00:52:56,850
What were they going to do with the 2 million?

989
00:52:56,850 --> 00:52:58,550
It seems like a lot has happened

990
00:52:58,550 --> 00:53:03,760
"I have 2 million in debts"

991
00:53:04,030 --> 00:53:08,830
"I cant live and pay the interest"

992
00:53:09,060 --> 00:53:12,870
So I need to pay back 2 million first

993
00:53:12,870 --> 00:53:15,340
I want to pay all the debts together

994
00:53:15,640 --> 00:53:18,240
Ten it said, "I will belong to Tanaka"

995
00:53:18,470 --> 00:53:20,580
Three letters have been sent from the same person

996
00:53:20,910 --> 00:53:24,150
The third letter had the repayment plan written on it

997
00:53:24,880 --> 00:53:27,780
40,000 per month

998
00:53:27,820 --> 00:53:30,290
It'd take a little over 5 years to pay back the money

999
00:53:30,320 --> 00:53:32,190
If they paid back 40,000 a month

1000
00:53:32,200 --> 00:53:34,120
They also wanted an extra 10,000 for themselves

1001
00:53:34,120 --> 00:53:37,260
Said it should be possible with your salary

1002
00:53:37,260 --> 00:53:40,260
Said they wanted to go to various places to play

1003
00:53:40,260 --> 00:53:42,760
Want to learn English conversation

1004
00:53:42,760 --> 00:53:46,000
You should forget English conversation for the moment

1005
00:53:46,000 --> 00:53:49,840
Shouldn't the extra 10,000 be returned to me as well?

1006
00:53:49,840 --> 00:53:51,870
Should pay me back 50,000 a month

1007
00:53:52,070 --> 00:53:55,880
Surely too naive

1008
00:53:56,190 --> 00:53:57,780
Finally

1009
00:54:01,840 --> 00:54:04,180
Creepy fan letter â‘¨

1010
00:54:04,940 --> 00:54:06,860
Egashira 2:50

1011
00:54:07,920 --> 00:54:12,330
20 years ago in the first month I checked the mailbox in front of my house

1012
00:54:12,430 --> 00:54:14,630
Inside was a New Year's card

1013
00:54:14,800 --> 00:54:16,130
Then I looked at the reverse side

1014
00:54:16,300 --> 00:54:18,870
It read "Happy New Year"

1015
00:54:19,000 --> 00:54:20,870
It was written in pubic hair!

1016
00:54:21,180 --> 00:54:25,840
New Year's greeting card with a pubic hair

1017
00:54:26,040 --> 00:54:30,080
If it was a woman it'd be okay but it was a man so I feel super disgusted

1018
00:54:30,460 --> 00:54:33,930
In summary
That's about the extent of what can be said on TV

1019
00:54:33,920 --> 00:54:34,880
What is this?

1020
00:54:35,340 --> 00:54:36,550
What do you mean it's okay if it was a woman?

1021
00:54:36,670 --> 00:54:37,590
Why?

1022
00:54:39,000 --> 00:54:40,610
But there are really ones that want to borrow money

1023
00:54:40,770 --> 00:54:43,510
The private messages on the social media have a bunch of these

1024
00:54:44,050 --> 00:54:45,150
Want to borrow money from you?

1025
00:54:45,150 --> 00:54:45,970
Loads!

1026
00:54:47,170 --> 00:54:48,180
You also get them?

1027
00:54:48,180 --> 00:54:48,810
Yes

1028
00:54:48,810 --> 00:54:50,110
Not really anymore

1029
00:54:50,220 --> 00:54:51,210
But there used to be from time to time

1030
00:54:51,900 --> 00:54:54,500
I did lend some

1031
00:54:54,790 --> 00:54:55,430
It's a lie, right?

1032
00:54:57,950 --> 00:54:59,380
Don't start!

1033
00:54:59,570 --> 00:55:01,210
Because of the silence so you must be lying

1034
00:55:01,920 --> 00:55:02,970
So obvious

1035
00:55:04,380 --> 00:55:34,910
