00:00:02,360 --> 00:00:06,020
Welcome to Wednesday Downtown

2
00:00:06,650 --> 00:00:10,450
Letâ€™s get on with our first presenter please

3
00:00:12,380 --> 00:00:13,700
Who is it?

4
00:00:15,200 --> 00:00:18,800
It's Bakarhythm!

5
00:00:19,910 --> 00:00:21,370
Bakarhythm
-Yes

6
00:00:21,370 --> 00:00:28,920
Straight to the point, have you guys ever wanted to be in the world of a TV show?

7
00:00:28,920 --> 00:00:30,020
Have you, Ano?

8
00:00:30,020 --> 00:00:32,450
Well, yes I suppose so

9
00:00:32,450 --> 00:00:33,710
Give me an example. Which one?

10
00:00:34,110 --> 00:00:35,860
Hanazawa Naoki

11
00:00:35,860 --> 00:00:38,380
So which character do you want to be?

12
00:00:38,650 --> 00:00:41,490
The stubborn Naoki

13
00:00:41,490 --> 00:00:44,590
Is Naoki characterized by stubbornness?

14
00:00:44,590 --> 00:00:45,760
Isn't he a more complex character?

15
00:00:45,760 --> 00:00:48,660
Is he stubborn?
-Not really

16
00:00:48,660 --> 00:00:53,330
So today, we bring you such an experience

17
00:00:53,330 --> 00:00:55,410
What?
-This is what it is

18
00:00:56,140 --> 00:01:02,940
A mind-numbing prank of not being able to leave the world of a mystery drama until the culprit is found

19
00:01:05,250 --> 00:01:13,720
In other words, they'll be involved in a mystery drama-style murder case

20
00:01:13,720 --> 00:01:15,510
But it differs from usual pranks in that

21
00:01:16,120 --> 00:01:19,160
It doesn't end until the culprit is found

22
00:01:19,160 --> 00:01:21,200
Knowing this

23
00:01:21,200 --> 00:01:24,060
Even though its obviously fake, they still have to find the culprit to bring it to an end

24
00:01:24,060 --> 00:01:25,760
How do you feel about this kind of trickery, Degawa?

25
00:01:27,060 --> 00:01:30,940
Well, it's, uh, it's, uh, it's kind of funny, but, uh, it's, uh

26
00:01:30,940 --> 00:01:33,740
Sorry... didn't get it at all

27
00:01:49,940 --> 00:01:54,560
So, the person we're calling out for a fake location shoot is

28
00:01:55,520 --> 00:01:57,730
Diane's Tsuda

29
00:02:00,210 --> 00:02:06,070
This time, he checks in one day early at a simple hotel in Nagano Prefecture

30
00:02:07,820 --> 00:02:14,420
The next morning he'll be swept up in the world of a mystery drama

31
00:02:14,720 --> 00:02:17,130
I'd like to introduce myself. I'm Sasaki, the director

32
00:02:18,610 --> 00:02:20,590
I'm Marui, the cameraman

33
00:02:23,810 --> 00:02:31,540
They then have a 30-minute meeting to discuss the itinerary for the next morning's fake location shoot

34
00:02:33,270 --> 00:02:37,410
So tomorrow is all planned
-Yes

35
00:02:37,640 --> 00:02:41,810
8:00 here. This is the cafeteria, so meet here at 8:00

36
00:02:41,810 --> 00:02:43,410
Ok, got it

37
00:02:43,410 --> 00:02:48,810
Let's just make a quick note

38
00:02:48,810 --> 00:02:50,550
Lest you forget, though you shouldn't

39
00:02:50,550 --> 00:02:52,220
Okay, got it

40
00:02:52,220 --> 00:02:53,550
Can stick it there

41
00:02:53,550 --> 00:02:54,790
I see

42
00:02:55,370 --> 00:03:00,820
After receiving a note with the next day's meeting time, he is dismissed

43
00:03:02,530 --> 00:03:04,170
Tutting as he comes back

44
00:03:03,030 --> 00:03:06,740
What is this? Don't even have a bath

45
00:03:06,730 --> 00:03:08,450
Started complaining right away

46
00:03:08,450 --> 00:03:10,280
That was fast

47
00:03:10,760 --> 00:03:14,630
After cursing the accommodation, he falls asleep

48
00:03:17,810 --> 00:03:24,850
Now, on the second day, the curtain rises on the mystery drama

49
00:03:25,380 --> 00:03:28,650
Good morning. Thank you

50
00:03:29,110 --> 00:03:30,290
Did you sleep well?

51
00:03:30,520 --> 00:03:32,420
Just slept a little
-Oh, really?

52
00:03:32,420 --> 00:03:36,060
I was watching football

53
00:03:36,760 --> 00:03:39,970
Good morning. Coffee
-Thank you

54
00:03:42,760 --> 00:03:43,390
Enjoy your meal

55
00:03:46,650 --> 00:03:48,650
Why are you in a bad mood?

56
00:03:51,180 --> 00:03:53,180
Very suspicious

57
00:03:55,420 --> 00:03:57,500
Staring straight at him

58
00:04:04,250 --> 00:04:06,010
You don't have to stare like that

59
00:04:05,930 --> 00:04:07,680
At this very moment

60
00:04:07,930 --> 00:04:11,960
Marui isn't here. I'm sorry

61
00:04:11,960 --> 00:04:14,200
Ah, it's totally fine

62
00:04:15,730 --> 00:04:19,170
Just one more moment, please. I'm sorry.
-It's okay

63
00:04:19,460 --> 00:04:23,660
Noone's picking up the phone, so...

64
00:04:23,660 --> 00:04:26,170
I'll go straight to him.
-Ok fine

65
00:04:34,090 --> 00:04:36,980
Why're you so tired?

66
00:04:42,730 --> 00:04:44,660
Mr. Marui

67
00:04:48,420 --> 00:04:49,700
Mr. Marui

68
00:04:51,270 --> 00:04:53,440
I'm opening the door

69
00:04:55,880 --> 00:04:58,240
Ah, Mr. Marui!

70
00:04:58,240 --> 00:05:00,310
Are you okay?

71
00:05:01,730 --> 00:05:04,640
Whoa scary!

72
00:05:05,290 --> 00:05:07,390
Mr. Marui has collapsed in his room!

73
00:05:07,390 --> 00:05:09,750
Tsuda, can you come over here for a minute?
-Mr. Marui?

74
00:05:08,420 --> 00:05:10,660
Worried
-Natural

75
00:05:10,660 --> 00:05:12,480
Helping seriously

76
00:05:14,430 --> 00:05:17,360
Something's holding the door shut

77
00:05:17,360 --> 00:05:19,400
But I can see his feet.
-What?

78
00:05:20,430 --> 00:05:22,300
Can you help me open it?

79
00:05:22,300 --> 00:05:23,870
Eh, you want me to do it?

80
00:05:23,870 --> 00:05:26,200
What's going on?

81
00:05:27,310 --> 00:05:30,110
Can you open it?
-No...

82
00:05:30,110 --> 00:05:32,710
Looks like there's an umbrella stuck in there

83
00:05:32,710 --> 00:05:35,680
Oh, its open!

84
00:05:35,680 --> 00:05:37,380
Eh eh eh?

85
00:05:37,950 --> 00:05:41,490
Ah, scared the shit out of me. Eh, what? What? What?

86
00:05:41,620 --> 00:05:43,790
Mr. Marui
-Eh?

87
00:05:43,790 --> 00:05:46,220
Eh, there's a knife...

88
00:05:47,490 --> 00:05:50,360
Killed...

89
00:05:49,400 --> 00:05:51,550
An easy to understand scenario

90
00:05:53,240 --> 00:05:56,330
He's laughing!

91
00:05:54,070 --> 00:05:56,670
Eh eh?

92
00:05:56,670 --> 00:05:58,300
Tsuda...
-Eh?

93
00:05:58,690 --> 00:06:02,080
Because this is a strange scenario no matter how you look at it

94
00:06:02,080 --> 00:06:06,370
Tsuda is immediately convinced it is a trick and couldn't help but laugh

95
00:06:07,080 --> 00:06:08,370
Is he dead?

96
00:06:08,370 --> 00:06:10,880
Saying something like "Is he dead?"...

97
00:06:11,380 --> 00:06:13,950
Eh, really?

98
00:06:12,010 --> 00:06:13,720
What a pain

99
00:06:13,720 --> 00:06:15,920
It's a pain in the ass, getting pranked like this

100
00:06:13,950 --> 00:06:16,420
Hey... wait

101
00:06:17,290 --> 00:06:18,790
Mr. Tsuda...

102
00:06:18,790 --> 00:06:19,920
No, it...

103
00:06:19,920 --> 00:06:21,530
Wait a moment!

104
00:06:21,530 --> 00:06:23,530
Ahhhh, you scared the shit out of me. What's going on?

105
00:06:23,530 --> 00:06:25,130
I'm a doctor

106
00:06:25,010 --> 00:06:26,300
Just by chance

107
00:06:26,060 --> 00:06:28,710
Wait a minute what's going on here...?

108
00:06:29,480 --> 00:06:31,180
A doctor

109
00:06:29,870 --> 00:06:31,170
What...

110
00:06:34,010 --> 00:06:36,540
No, what's going on...

111
00:06:36,540 --> 00:06:37,080
He's dead

112
00:06:38,140 --> 00:06:39,880
What the hell is this...

113
00:06:39,880 --> 00:06:41,750
Eh?

114
00:06:43,920 --> 00:06:45,450
It's weird, isn't it?

115
00:06:45,450 --> 00:06:48,190
I don't know what's going on, though

116
00:06:48,190 --> 00:06:49,850
But the cause of death

117
00:06:49,850 --> 00:06:53,020
Must be the stab wound from this knife

118
00:06:53,390 --> 00:06:56,330
Of course... what the hell?

119
00:06:57,330 --> 00:06:59,500
Judging by the stiffness of the body

120
00:06:58,770 --> 00:07:00,820
Looking for the cameras

121
00:07:00,060 --> 00:07:02,430
The presumed time of death was 3:00 a.m

122
00:07:02,730 --> 00:07:06,170
No...what ... what are we talking about...

123
00:07:06,170 --> 00:07:08,740
The exact time is unclear

124
00:07:08,740 --> 00:07:10,640
But it was around that time

125
00:07:10,640 --> 00:07:13,450
No... he...he ...

126
00:07:13,450 --> 00:07:15,550
Is he okay? He's alive...

127
00:07:15,550 --> 00:07:17,820
Please don't touch him

128
00:07:17,820 --> 00:07:20,290
But that... blood... it's weird

129
00:07:20,290 --> 00:07:20,890
Please calm down

130
00:07:21,100 --> 00:07:22,990
I'm already calm

131
00:07:22,990 --> 00:07:24,390
What kind of situation is this?

132
00:07:24,390 --> 00:07:27,160
Let's get organized

133
00:07:27,160 --> 00:07:28,860
Organize... organize what?

134
00:07:29,060 --> 00:07:31,030
Let's all go back to the cafeteria

135
00:07:31,030 --> 00:07:33,330
Why?

136
00:07:34,100 --> 00:07:37,040
Call an ambulance or the police

137
00:07:38,100 --> 00:07:39,700
Everyone...
-Call the police

138
00:07:39,700 --> 00:07:42,770
Let's all go back to the cafeteria together first... then call the cops

139
00:07:42,820 --> 00:07:44,560
Do as you're told

140
00:07:48,050 --> 00:07:48,810
What is this...

141
00:07:48,810 --> 00:07:50,750
Let's go

142
00:07:49,620 --> 00:07:52,130
It always happens like this

143
00:07:51,780 --> 00:07:53,850
And "Let's go"...

144
00:07:54,290 --> 00:07:56,220
Can't help but go along with it

145
00:07:56,220 --> 00:07:58,130
Yeah

146
00:07:58,260 --> 00:08:00,230
Otherwise it'd be over

147
00:08:00,590 --> 00:08:05,620
Although Tsuda was commenting constantly at this inexplicable situation

148
00:08:06,480 --> 00:08:13,180
This trick has a special mechanism that it won't end until the culprit is found

149
00:08:12,650 --> 00:08:15,140
Quite interesting

150
00:08:13,180 --> 00:08:17,720
So Tsuda's actions will be ignored

151
00:08:18,680 --> 00:08:19,980
What's going on here?

152
00:08:19,980 --> 00:08:21,610
Why haven't the police been called...

153
00:08:21,610 --> 00:08:23,850
Why are you sitting in my seat all of a sudden?

154
00:08:23,850 --> 00:08:27,520
Anyway, let's call the police first

155
00:08:27,650 --> 00:08:29,450
Go ahead

156
00:08:29,550 --> 00:08:31,320
No good...

157
00:08:31,320 --> 00:08:32,590
The phone line's been cut

158
00:08:32,760 --> 00:08:34,530
Eh? The phone line

159
00:08:34,530 --> 00:08:35,630
You all have cell phones, right?

160
00:08:35,630 --> 00:08:38,700
Cell phones too... no signal

161
00:08:38,700 --> 00:08:40,640
My cell phone is fine

162
00:08:40,830 --> 00:08:43,700
Oh, really?
-I can't get a signal either

163
00:08:44,070 --> 00:08:46,970
I've got three bars

164
00:08:46,970 --> 00:08:47,840
There's no signal

165
00:08:47,970 --> 00:08:50,210
It's not like there's no signal

166
00:08:49,560 --> 00:08:51,140
There's no signal in this world

167
00:08:50,350 --> 00:08:52,790
Under these circumstances

168
00:08:52,980 --> 00:08:54,980
No good

169
00:08:54,980 --> 00:08:58,050
Because of the heavy rain, the river's flooded

170
00:08:58,050 --> 00:08:58,880
It's fake, right?

171
00:08:58,880 --> 00:09:00,990
The bridge is washed away

172
00:09:00,990 --> 00:09:01,720
Eh?

173
00:09:01,720 --> 00:09:02,890
No, it's just a little rain

174
00:09:02,570 --> 00:09:04,050
Can't get out

175
00:09:02,890 --> 00:09:06,720
The only bridge connected to the city...

176
00:09:05,700 --> 00:09:07,640
They're on an island

177
00:09:07,040 --> 00:09:10,820
Contact with the outside world and means of transportation are disrupted

178
00:09:11,200 --> 00:09:15,660
The hotel itself is a huge escape room

179
00:09:15,660 --> 00:09:20,100
The setup is just a little cheap bit of that

180
00:09:20,170 --> 00:09:21,010
Tsuda

181
00:09:21,010 --> 00:09:21,740
What?

182
00:09:21,740 --> 00:09:22,680
Well...

183
00:09:22,970 --> 00:09:25,580
What's going on? What's going on?

184
00:09:25,710 --> 00:09:31,450
The bridge is broken. No can leave

185
00:09:31,450 --> 00:09:33,550
The people who have been here since yesterday

186
00:09:33,550 --> 00:09:39,460
Including the dead Mr. Marui, are all still here

187
00:09:40,560 --> 00:09:43,160
That is to say...

188
00:09:41,020 --> 00:09:42,670
In other words

189
00:09:43,360 --> 00:09:46,970
What about the culprit?

190
00:09:46,970 --> 00:09:49,530
"What about the culprit?"

191
00:09:48,200 --> 00:09:49,580
Passing him the ball

192
00:09:49,530 --> 00:09:51,700
I'll say it again

193
00:09:51,700 --> 00:09:57,380
The bridge is broken. No one can leave

194
00:09:56,720 --> 00:09:58,300
What an idiot

195
00:09:57,380 --> 00:09:59,550
The people who have been here since yesterday

196
00:09:59,550 --> 00:10:02,860
Are all still here

197
00:10:02,860 --> 00:10:05,050
That is to say...

198
00:10:05,050 --> 00:10:06,950
What about the culprit?

199
00:10:06,950 --> 00:10:08,890
"What about the culprit?"

200
00:10:08,890 --> 00:10:12,490
Ah, that...

201
00:10:12,490 --> 00:10:13,990
You mean, like, "the culprit is still among us"?

202
00:10:20,130 --> 00:10:22,930
Now you say it

203
00:10:23,200 --> 00:10:24,570
Eh?

204
00:10:24,570 --> 00:10:25,610
What?

205
00:10:25,610 --> 00:10:28,380
It's nothing to do with us, and I don't want to stay here any longer

206
00:10:28,840 --> 00:10:30,440
Sayuri, come back

207
00:10:30,440 --> 00:10:31,650
Just a minute

208
00:10:31,780 --> 00:10:34,680
The bridge has been washed away so cars can't get across

209
00:10:33,280 --> 00:10:35,650
There's a car outside

210
00:10:34,680 --> 00:10:37,680
Does that mean we're stuck here?

211
00:10:38,520 --> 00:10:42,020
Cars are making noises outside

212
00:10:42,020 --> 00:10:43,550
Tsuda, can I have a word?

213
00:10:43,550 --> 00:10:46,020
Really, it's so early still...

214
00:10:46,020 --> 00:10:47,860
Tsuda, can we go to the 2nd floor?
-Really?

215
00:10:47,860 --> 00:10:50,060
What the hell? It's so early still...

216
00:10:51,800 --> 00:10:54,230
Seriously, what's going on here...

217
00:10:54,830 --> 00:10:56,870
This guy is definitely the culprit

218
00:10:57,040 --> 00:11:00,000
Here... here for what?

219
00:11:00,000 --> 00:11:01,470
Well

220
00:11:01,740 --> 00:11:04,510
How about we resolve the incident?

221
00:11:04,510 --> 00:11:06,680
Why?

222
00:11:06,680 --> 00:11:08,550
What for?

223
00:11:08,850 --> 00:11:10,550
You want to avenge Mr. Marui's death, don't you?

224
00:11:10,550 --> 00:11:13,150
No, what's it got to do with me? It doesn't matter

225
00:11:13,150 --> 00:11:15,250
I don't have any memories with him

226
00:11:16,100 --> 00:11:21,690
Forcing Tsuda, an overly aloof man, into the role of detective

227
00:11:21,690 --> 00:11:26,340
First is to confirm the alibi of the entire staff

228
00:11:26,360 --> 00:11:27,830
Let's go.
-Can we go?

229
00:11:27,830 --> 00:11:29,130
Go solve the incident

230
00:11:29,130 --> 00:11:31,900
Why do I have to be the one to solve it...

231
00:11:33,070 --> 00:11:35,310
What... what program is this exactly?

232
00:11:35,740 --> 00:11:37,410
Please.
-With this?

233
00:11:39,110 --> 00:11:40,180
Is it okay to ask?

234
00:11:40,280 --> 00:11:41,780
What should I ask?

235
00:11:41,780 --> 00:11:44,630
Name and what they did last night

236
00:11:44,630 --> 00:11:46,020
Ah, like this

237
00:11:46,020 --> 00:11:48,090
That's all that needs to be asked

238
00:11:46,570 --> 00:11:48,090
Get the alibi

239
00:11:48,520 --> 00:11:50,250
I'm sorry

240
00:11:50,460 --> 00:11:51,760
You're the owner, right?
-Yes, I am

241
00:11:51,760 --> 00:11:52,720
Can you give me your name?

242
00:11:53,330 --> 00:11:55,890
I'm Terashima, the owner.
-Ok

243
00:11:55,890 --> 00:12:00,700
Last night, I was watching a movie in my room

244
00:12:00,700 --> 00:12:04,200
"Watched a movie."

245
00:12:04,200 --> 00:12:05,740
What movie?

246
00:12:06,140 --> 00:12:07,410
Pocahontas

247
00:12:07,640 --> 00:12:12,410
Pocahontas? Why that...?

248
00:12:12,810 --> 00:12:15,100
It's not the kind of movie you'd randomely watch

249
00:12:12,840 --> 00:12:14,980
Watched Pocahontas

250
00:12:14,980 --> 00:12:19,560
Here's the alibi for the others

251
00:12:14,980 --> 00:12:21,990
No comment

252
00:12:14,980 --> 00:12:21,990
Three people
played poker

253
00:12:14,980 --> 00:12:21,990
Watched a
movie alone

254
00:12:19,500 --> 00:12:22,070
No comment is suspicious

255
00:12:22,150 --> 00:12:24,560
You two asked us

256
00:12:24,560 --> 00:12:25,390
Yeah

257
00:12:25,590 --> 00:12:27,430
What about you two?

258
00:12:27,430 --> 00:12:29,050
Uh, yeah

259
00:12:29,050 --> 00:12:29,990
You are the director...

260
00:12:29,990 --> 00:12:31,230
Sasaki

261
00:12:31,230 --> 00:12:33,660
My name is Miyu Sasaki

262
00:12:34,770 --> 00:12:35,430
What were you doing then?

263
00:12:35,430 --> 00:12:38,940
I was using a GoPro for location shooting

264
00:12:38,940 --> 00:12:41,840
Ah, checking the GoPro?
-Checking it

265
00:12:42,110 --> 00:12:45,080
On the computer...

266
00:12:45,080 --> 00:12:46,610
A recording

267
00:12:51,880 --> 00:12:53,280
Ah, that's it...

268
00:12:55,950 --> 00:12:58,390
Ah, it's the way it looks in the room

269
00:12:59,850 --> 00:13:02,830
Selfie. Ah, 3:08

270
00:13:02,270 --> 00:13:04,000
About that time

271
00:13:04,590 --> 00:13:06,960
Ah, about that time

272
00:13:07,200 --> 00:13:09,330
That's an alibi, isn't it?

273
00:13:10,000 --> 00:13:11,500
That should do it

274
00:13:11,640 --> 00:13:13,840
So, Tsuda

275
00:13:13,840 --> 00:13:14,700
Eh?

276
00:13:14,700 --> 00:13:15,740
What were you doing?

277
00:13:15,740 --> 00:13:18,480
Me? I was sleeping

278
00:13:18,480 --> 00:13:19,600
In bed...

279
00:13:19,600 --> 00:13:21,210
Went to bed after watching football

280
00:13:21,310 --> 00:13:23,580
Doesn't that mean you have no alibi?

281
00:13:23,580 --> 00:13:24,680
What?

282
00:13:25,550 --> 00:13:27,280
Shouldn't everyone be asleep at that hour?

283
00:13:27,290 --> 00:13:31,620
I mean, you've been point the finger at everyone else

284
00:13:32,090 --> 00:13:34,560
Scared me! What are you doing?

285
00:13:34,560 --> 00:13:36,930
I think you're the culprit

286
00:13:36,930 --> 00:13:38,360
No, no, no...it's inexplicable

287
00:13:38,360 --> 00:13:39,500
But it makes sense, doesn't it?

288
00:13:39,500 --> 00:13:40,400
Why does that make sense?

289
00:13:40,400 --> 00:13:42,230
Your reaction is suspicious

290
00:13:42,230 --> 00:13:43,730
What, how?

291
00:13:44,370 --> 00:13:48,010
Why am I the culprit on a TV show?

292
00:13:48,910 --> 00:13:51,010
Why are you so quiet all of a sudden?

293
00:13:51,180 --> 00:13:54,280
You're the one who said "TV program"

294
00:13:54,890 --> 00:13:58,720
Suspicion of Tsuda cannot be cleared for the time being...

295
00:13:58,720 --> 00:14:02,680
So the first step was to establish everyone's alibi

296
00:14:02,680 --> 00:14:05,420
The next step is to find the evidence

297
00:14:05,490 --> 00:14:09,590
Wouldn't it be better to investigate Mr. Marui's room again?

298
00:14:09,690 --> 00:14:10,960
That's right

299
00:14:11,260 --> 00:14:13,660
Let's go see if there's any more evidence

300
00:14:17,370 --> 00:14:18,200
Where?

301
00:14:18,200 --> 00:14:19,300
Let's go

302
00:14:19,300 --> 00:14:20,420
I'll come along

303
00:14:20,420 --> 00:14:21,170
Ah, the doctor, right?

304
00:14:21,170 --> 00:14:22,640
You're Mr. Hasegawa, right?

305
00:14:22,640 --> 00:14:25,940
I'm Takuro Hasegawa

306
00:14:25,940 --> 00:14:26,840
Let's go

307
00:14:30,650 --> 00:14:33,850
Let's find out what other evidence there is

308
00:14:33,850 --> 00:14:35,320
What? Evidence?

309
00:14:35,320 --> 00:14:36,490
Maybe even fingerprints...

310
00:14:37,150 --> 00:14:40,320
Ah, I've got my fingerprint checker with me

311
00:14:40,320 --> 00:14:42,960
Why would you bring it?

312
00:14:42,960 --> 00:14:45,230
Why?

313
00:14:45,580 --> 00:14:51,450
Dr. Hasegawa had a fingerprint test kit with him for some reason

314
00:14:51,450 --> 00:14:57,740
The culprit's fingerprints were lifted from the handle of the murder weapon's pocket knife and the inside handle of the door

315
00:14:58,640 --> 00:14:59,840
Tsuda

316
00:15:00,540 --> 00:15:04,580
This fingerprint. Did you find anything?

317
00:15:04,680 --> 00:15:06,260
Something from the fingerprints?

318
00:15:06,260 --> 00:15:08,020
The hell do I know?

319
00:15:08,020 --> 00:15:11,160
A culprit... exists

320
00:15:11,160 --> 00:15:13,890
Found out someone killed him

321
00:15:13,890 --> 00:15:16,190
Tsuda

322
00:15:16,190 --> 00:15:19,500
This fingerprint. Did you find anything?

323
00:15:19,500 --> 00:15:21,030
Again?

324
00:15:21,030 --> 00:15:23,180
She'll never stop asking questions

325
00:15:23,400 --> 00:15:24,970
It's like a game

326
00:15:25,400 --> 00:15:28,110
Is there any other...that is to say any other reason?

327
00:15:28,510 --> 00:15:30,880
Wait a moment

328
00:15:30,880 --> 00:15:34,610
The fingerprints here are the same as here, right?

329
00:15:34,610 --> 00:15:37,620
Ah, 1, 2, 3, 4

330
00:15:37,620 --> 00:15:38,580
There are four fingerprints

331
00:15:40,800 --> 00:15:42,440
Think about it

332
00:15:44,220 --> 00:15:45,920
Left-handed

333
00:15:46,220 --> 00:15:48,660
It's true that he's left-handed

334
00:15:50,190 --> 00:15:52,140
He's kind of happy

335
00:15:51,380 --> 00:15:53,000
Stabbed like this

336
00:15:53,000 --> 00:15:56,900
So there's four prints on this, which means the perp's left-handed

337
00:15:56,900 --> 00:15:59,240
Eh? Really?

338
00:15:59,240 --> 00:16:01,670
Yes, we're making progress

339
00:16:01,670 --> 00:16:03,470
What's next?

340
00:16:03,470 --> 00:16:05,910
What, are you looking for a lefty?

341
00:16:06,170 --> 00:16:11,420
Is there any other evidence here?
-Eh?

342
00:16:08,780 --> 00:16:10,160
There's more

343
00:16:11,590 --> 00:16:19,010
They checked Marui's backpack for evidence

344
00:16:19,590 --> 00:16:21,590
Anything?

345
00:16:21,590 --> 00:16:23,330
Shinshu Daily News

346
00:16:23,330 --> 00:16:26,080
Death of a member of the Mountaineering Department

347
00:16:26,720 --> 00:16:34,040
Tsuyoshi Ito (19), a second-year mountaineer at Suwa University in Nagano Prefecture, fell from a mountain

348
00:16:34,040 --> 00:16:35,370
Fellow travelers called the police

349
00:16:35,470 --> 00:16:39,210
The owner of the hotel where Mr. Ito stayed talked about the dangers at the site, saying...

350
00:16:41,850 --> 00:16:43,510
Ah, Mr. Terashima

351
00:16:43,750 --> 00:16:47,420
The owner of this place. It's in the paper

352
00:16:47,860 --> 00:16:50,840
Anything else?

353
00:16:53,820 --> 00:16:55,360
Is this Mr. Hasegawa?

354
00:16:56,990 --> 00:16:59,000
This one

355
00:16:59,000 --> 00:17:01,970
Looks like Mr. Hasegawa, right?

356
00:17:02,670 --> 00:17:06,000
I mean, everyone's in the paper, right? Everyone who's here

357
00:17:07,410 --> 00:17:08,340
There are also women

358
00:17:09,430 --> 00:17:10,870
You're right

359
00:17:11,240 --> 00:17:13,180
1234â€¦

360
00:17:13,700 --> 00:17:16,250
Well, everyone downstairs is in the picture

361
00:17:16,250 --> 00:17:17,620
In other words

362
00:17:17,620 --> 00:17:18,550
What?

363
00:17:18,550 --> 00:17:21,720
The men...

364
00:17:21,720 --> 00:17:24,090
Do they know each other?

365
00:17:24,090 --> 00:17:25,720
Yeah

366
00:17:26,060 --> 00:17:28,660
Let's go downstairs first and summarize

367
00:17:28,660 --> 00:17:31,600
This story is getting more and more backstory

368
00:17:31,700 --> 00:17:36,100
People who behave strangely when investigating alibis

369
00:17:36,470 --> 00:17:38,470
Mr. Yamada, right?

370
00:17:39,540 --> 00:17:41,940
Mr. Yamada didn't say anything

371
00:17:41,940 --> 00:17:44,010
The strangest ones are Mr. Yamada and Mr. Terashima

372
00:17:44,010 --> 00:17:48,140
What's so strange about Mr. Terashima?

373
00:17:48,450 --> 00:17:50,580
Watching a movie...

374
00:17:50,580 --> 00:17:54,520
Who would watch Pocahontas at 3:00 in the morning?

375
00:17:54,520 --> 00:17:57,470
What aroused Tsuda's suspicions was

376
00:17:57,470 --> 00:18:00,890
Yamada, who kept quiet about last night's action

377
00:18:00,890 --> 00:18:04,230
And Terashima, who claimed to be watching a movie alone in his room

378
00:18:04,230 --> 00:18:12,310
Then they deduced from the traces at the scene that the culprit was left-handed

379
00:18:13,070 --> 00:18:16,040
In other words, the culprit is...

380
00:18:19,210 --> 00:18:20,850
Mr. Yamada

381
00:18:22,980 --> 00:18:25,080
His right hand is bandaged

382
00:18:25,080 --> 00:18:27,450
Not left-handed

383
00:18:27,450 --> 00:18:31,920
Instead, the culprit had to use his left hand

384
00:18:31,920 --> 00:18:36,190
Mr. Yamada's right hand was injured, so he had to stab with his left

385
00:18:36,190 --> 00:18:38,430
In other words, the culprit is...

386
00:18:38,600 --> 00:18:40,000
Mr. Yamada

387
00:18:43,130 --> 00:18:46,300
Let's go to Mr. Yamada's room and ask him for confirmation. Come on

388
00:18:47,070 --> 00:18:49,080
Bring this?

389
00:18:49,740 --> 00:18:53,110
With or without.
-Either...

390
00:18:54,300 --> 00:18:56,440
It's because it's already been decided how it's going to develop

391
00:18:57,850 --> 00:18:59,160
No answer

392
00:18:59,160 --> 00:19:01,250
No?
-Yeah

393
00:19:01,160 --> 00:19:03,950
Huh? Scary

394
00:19:02,620 --> 00:19:03,990
The door is open

395
00:19:03,990 --> 00:19:05,620
Can we go in?

396
00:19:07,730 --> 00:19:10,060
Ahhhh! Eh!

397
00:19:10,830 --> 00:19:12,530
Dead?

398
00:19:12,900 --> 00:19:14,200
He's dead

399
00:19:16,130 --> 00:19:18,900
Hey, he's dead!

400
00:19:20,700 --> 00:19:22,740
Hey, Mr. Yamada is dead

401
00:19:23,010 --> 00:19:24,540
What's with the Kansai accent...

402
00:19:24,540 --> 00:19:25,940
It's ruining the atmosphere...

403
00:19:28,380 --> 00:19:30,490
Confession

404
00:19:30,490 --> 00:19:31,650
He's confessed

405
00:19:31,650 --> 00:19:33,370
I'm the one who killed Marui

406
00:19:33,370 --> 00:19:37,380
The accident...no, I should say incident...28 years ago

407
00:19:37,380 --> 00:19:41,000
He was going to tell the truth about the day Ito fell to his death

408
00:19:41,000 --> 00:19:42,940
I was so angry, I killed him

409
00:19:43,060 --> 00:19:46,730
That is to say, as expected...

410
00:19:47,870 --> 00:19:51,100
The culprit is Mr. Yamada

411
00:19:51,340 --> 00:19:53,430
Yeah

412
00:19:53,430 --> 00:19:59,200
And then, unable to bear the burden of sin, he died

413
00:19:59,340 --> 00:20:03,610
The incident is resolved

414
00:20:04,380 --> 00:20:06,320
Well, that's the way it is, isn't it?

415
00:20:06,610 --> 00:20:09,880
The incident in Tsuda's mind has been resolved

416
00:20:09,880 --> 00:20:12,120
However

417
00:20:10,270 --> 00:20:13,540
The victim and the killer are dead

418
00:20:23,930 --> 00:20:25,490
Doesn't get it

419
00:20:26,560 --> 00:20:29,170
Can't figure out what's wrong with it

420
00:20:28,970 --> 00:20:31,810
What is this?

421
00:20:34,320 --> 00:20:36,420
It's not about the incident

422
00:20:36,780 --> 00:20:40,220
What to do?

423
00:20:40,520 --> 00:20:44,460
What can I do to end it?

424
00:20:44,760 --> 00:20:47,650
Yeah, well, the fun's not over yet

425
00:20:47,650 --> 00:20:50,800
It means that the matter has not been resolved

426
00:21:05,140 --> 00:21:08,060
Tsuda, did you think of something?

427
00:21:08,060 --> 00:21:08,650
It's just that the...

428
00:21:09,480 --> 00:21:11,480
Mr. Yamada is dead

429
00:21:12,010 --> 00:21:17,900
Tsuda told Dr. Hasegawa what he had previously learned

430
00:21:19,160 --> 00:21:22,660
Here, that...

431
00:21:24,260 --> 00:21:29,130
All the people here are related to the events that were published in the newspaper

432
00:21:29,130 --> 00:21:31,370
Mr. Hasegawa is one of them

433
00:21:31,930 --> 00:21:34,370
Then Hasegawa confessed

434
00:21:34,370 --> 00:21:40,920
This time, everyone was actually called to the hotel after receiving strange letters

435
00:21:40,920 --> 00:21:50,120
As well as hiding the relationship between them due to the threat of a fall accident back then

436
00:21:52,200 --> 00:21:53,760
At this time

437
00:21:55,930 --> 00:21:56,630
Did something happen?

438
00:21:56,630 --> 00:21:58,330
Oh, I'm sorry to hear that

439
00:21:58,330 --> 00:22:01,430
Lately, the electric switch has been tripping on its own

440
00:22:01,430 --> 00:22:06,340
Yesterday, between 2:30 and 6:00 in the morning

441
00:22:06,700 --> 00:22:09,410
The circuit breaker's tripped, too

442
00:22:09,410 --> 00:22:09,940
Eh?

443
00:22:09,940 --> 00:22:12,780
I don't know if it's bothering any of you?

444
00:22:11,900 --> 00:22:14,400
Taking notes now

445
00:22:12,780 --> 00:22:14,410
The circuit breaker tripped?

446
00:22:14,850 --> 00:22:16,110
I didn't even notice

447
00:22:16,110 --> 00:22:17,880
Oh, I'm so sorry

448
00:22:18,970 --> 00:22:21,380
What's the secret?

449
00:22:21,380 --> 00:22:26,860
That's when the two came to Yamada's room again to investigate

450
00:22:27,960 --> 00:22:30,190
Tsuda
-Yes

451
00:22:31,400 --> 00:22:33,530
I'm thinking

452
00:22:33,730 --> 00:22:36,630
Yamada didn't commit suicide.
-I see

453
00:22:36,630 --> 00:22:37,400
I see

454
00:22:37,570 --> 00:22:40,470
It's...
-He was killed

455
00:22:40,470 --> 00:22:43,110
I think that's more likely.
-Yes

456
00:22:44,480 --> 00:22:46,440
The culprit is someone else

457
00:22:46,810 --> 00:22:52,120
For some reason Tsuda seemed to have finally made up his mind at this point

458
00:22:52,350 --> 00:22:57,450
Maybe there's some evidence left here too

459
00:23:05,000 --> 00:23:06,460
This one's a little weird

460
00:23:07,260 --> 00:23:09,530
This light

461
00:23:09,530 --> 00:23:11,770
What's so strange about this clock?

462
00:23:12,300 --> 00:23:15,570
It's not running. It just keeps flashing

463
00:23:16,240 --> 00:23:18,540
Blackout...

464
00:23:18,880 --> 00:23:23,280
The power's out, so it's out.
-And then

465
00:23:24,950 --> 00:23:26,780
And...

466
00:23:27,320 --> 00:23:30,050
This mirror is weird, too

467
00:23:30,050 --> 00:23:34,730
What's going on? What's wrong with this mirror?

468
00:23:39,060 --> 00:23:40,030
Eh?

469
00:23:40,030 --> 00:23:41,770
I think there's some kind of number written here

470
00:23:42,000 --> 00:23:43,170
What does it say?

471
00:23:43,170 --> 00:23:45,740
It's "1114," right?

472
00:23:46,840 --> 00:23:50,610
This is the message of death, isn't it?

473
00:23:50,610 --> 00:23:52,410
It's a death message

474
00:23:52,710 --> 00:23:54,140
"1114"?

475
00:23:54,480 --> 00:23:56,660
November 14th?

476
00:23:56,660 --> 00:23:57,980
November 14

477
00:23:57,980 --> 00:23:59,280
Yeah

478
00:23:59,290 --> 00:24:00,820
Birthday?

479
00:24:00,820 --> 00:24:02,790
Whose birthday is it?

480
00:24:02,790 --> 00:24:04,760
The elevation of the mountain?

481
00:24:05,060 --> 00:24:07,060
1,114-meter mountain

482
00:24:07,060 --> 00:24:08,290
Too short?

483
00:24:09,790 --> 00:24:12,130
Is this "1114"?

484
00:24:12,050 --> 00:24:14,040
Look at it from a different angle

485
00:24:17,470 --> 00:24:19,640
Want to use a mirror?

486
00:24:23,670 --> 00:24:24,840
If you look in the mirror...

487
00:24:29,480 --> 00:24:30,880
"Miyu"?

488
00:24:31,250 --> 00:24:33,450
"Miyu" "Sasaki Miyu"

489
00:24:34,420 --> 00:24:35,790
It's Miyu

490
00:24:38,390 --> 00:24:43,390
But Miyu was busy at the time of Mr. Marui's murder

491
00:24:43,390 --> 00:24:45,200
There's an alibi

492
00:24:46,570 --> 00:24:50,370
Clock, that...selfie in the room

493
00:24:50,510 --> 00:24:55,260
Then Tsuda checked the video image once more

494
00:24:56,940 --> 00:24:59,480
Wait a minute, please

495
00:24:59,480 --> 00:25:02,610
The power's out at 3:08

496
00:25:02,610 --> 00:25:05,350
The power's on in here...it's on, which is weird, right?

497
00:25:03,370 --> 00:25:04,230
So happy

498
00:25:06,350 --> 00:25:08,550
Tsuda, this is a great discovery

499
00:25:08,750 --> 00:25:10,920
Oi!

500
00:25:11,660 --> 00:25:12,860
Oi!

501
00:25:12,860 --> 00:25:16,590
And then there's this suicide note...

502
00:25:17,090 --> 00:25:19,300
It's like its written by a woman

503
00:25:19,300 --> 00:25:21,200
Is there any handwriting to compare it to?

504
00:25:21,570 --> 00:25:23,230
Ah-

505
00:25:24,170 --> 00:25:27,570
Ah-what's there? What's there?

506
00:25:27,570 --> 00:25:28,740
She wrote something

507
00:25:29,010 --> 00:25:30,940
Want to go look for it?
-Okay

508
00:25:31,730 --> 00:25:33,780
The one he got the day before

509
00:25:34,850 --> 00:25:37,050
It's not in that script?

510
00:25:34,980 --> 00:25:38,550
Yes, the one with the meeting time

511
00:25:37,050 --> 00:25:38,800
She took it, didn't she?

512
00:25:38,800 --> 00:25:40,800
No, that'd be weird

513
00:25:41,790 --> 00:25:43,190
Not here

514
00:25:43,510 --> 00:25:45,560
Not here...

515
00:25:46,260 --> 00:25:48,660
Nothing else?

516
00:25:49,690 --> 00:25:51,760
Please think back

517
00:25:51,760 --> 00:25:55,030
Oh, wow. I was in a daze at that point

518
00:25:56,030 --> 00:25:58,270
Eh...

519
00:26:03,170 --> 00:26:06,340
Ah, the paper with today's meeting time on it

520
00:26:10,510 --> 00:26:11,210
He got it

521
00:26:11,270 --> 00:26:13,140
So funny

522
00:26:15,550 --> 00:26:17,590
Ohhhh!

523
00:26:18,920 --> 00:26:20,120
Aaahhhh!

524
00:26:20,360 --> 00:26:22,160
Ah, scary

525
00:26:22,790 --> 00:26:24,430
This

526
00:26:24,430 --> 00:26:25,900
This this this this this this this

527
00:26:25,260 --> 00:26:27,720
That's what happens when you think carefully

528
00:26:25,900 --> 00:26:28,730
Let's compare.
-Wow

529
00:26:28,730 --> 00:26:32,140
Whoa, scary

530
00:26:32,470 --> 00:26:33,200
Ah- scary!

531
00:26:33,200 --> 00:26:35,490
8 is the same

532
00:26:35,740 --> 00:26:38,380
It's the same 8

533
00:26:38,360 --> 00:26:40,030
It's a very distinctive feature

534
00:26:38,380 --> 00:26:40,030
Look!

535
00:26:40,030 --> 00:26:41,550
28 years and 8

536
00:26:41,980 --> 00:26:44,680
8 is the same as this...

537
00:26:47,150 --> 00:26:48,350
I'll go get everyone

538
00:26:48,590 --> 00:26:50,450
Okay
-I'll have everyone gather in the cafeteria

539
00:26:50,720 --> 00:26:52,720
Please reveal the real culprit.
-Okay

540
00:26:53,320 --> 00:26:54,680
It's a pep talk

541
00:26:55,230 --> 00:26:58,040
This guy can be a real pain in the ass when he really gets going

542
00:26:59,700 --> 00:27:00,630
One moment, please.
-Okay

543
00:27:04,900 --> 00:27:08,200
Eh, what's this feeling...

544
00:27:08,500 --> 00:27:12,750
And now, the prank is finally coming to a climax

545
00:27:13,570 --> 00:27:19,580
Detective Tsuda, the first part of the serial hotel killings

546
00:27:20,220 --> 00:27:23,320
Mr. Yamada was killed by someone

547
00:27:21,440 --> 00:27:23,350
Like a movie

548
00:27:23,320 --> 00:27:26,190
Next to Mr. Yamada's body

549
00:27:26,690 --> 00:27:29,860
Was this suicide note

550
00:27:28,860 --> 00:27:31,000
Kansai accent is completely gone

551
00:27:29,860 --> 00:27:33,300
It looks like it was written by a woman

552
00:27:33,500 --> 00:27:38,840
I got a note yesterday

553
00:27:39,770 --> 00:27:45,580
This is Ms. Sasaki's. You wrote it

554
00:27:45,880 --> 00:27:49,250
Then, Mr. Yamada's desk was left open

555
00:27:49,250 --> 00:27:52,380
Dining... dining... dining message

556
00:27:52,380 --> 00:27:55,750
Dying message

557
00:27:56,990 --> 00:27:59,160
"Miyu" in katakana

558
00:27:59,160 --> 00:28:00,890
You can tell it's "Miyu"

559
00:28:00,890 --> 00:28:02,800
In other words

560
00:28:02,800 --> 00:28:06,650
You're the one who wrote this suicide note, Ms. Miyu

561
00:28:06,650 --> 00:28:08,670
The culprit is you

562
00:28:16,000 --> 00:28:20,080
Although Tsuda was so impatient at first...

563
00:28:20,660 --> 00:28:25,650
He's now a full-blown detective

564
00:28:28,390 --> 00:28:30,250
What are you talking about?

565
00:28:30,490 --> 00:28:32,960
I have an alibi...

566
00:28:34,390 --> 00:28:37,190
You showed us this alibi video

567
00:28:38,350 --> 00:28:44,200
A famous detective who brilliantly solved the alibi ruse

568
00:28:44,430 --> 00:28:48,370
So you shot this video at some other time and put the clock on it

569
00:28:48,370 --> 00:28:51,680
The video was not taken at that time

570
00:28:51,680 --> 00:28:53,280
Isn't that correct!?

571
00:28:53,460 --> 00:28:55,280
He's tough

572
00:28:57,000 --> 00:28:59,980
Now that i've been exposed, there's nothing I can do about it.
-Oh, oh!

573
00:28:59,980 --> 00:29:04,090
I didn't realize that the handwriting would reveal it

574
00:29:06,120 --> 00:29:10,530
But i'll never forgive

575
00:29:10,760 --> 00:29:17,970
How could you forget Ito from the former mountaineering group?

576
00:29:18,540 --> 00:29:20,270
Well...

577
00:29:20,680 --> 00:29:25,240
It's your fault my brother is dead

578
00:29:24,720 --> 00:29:26,310
So realistic

579
00:29:25,730 --> 00:29:30,970
The real killer, Miyu Sasaki, is the brother of Miyu Ito

580
00:29:31,520 --> 00:29:37,990
It's because the mountaineering group, especially Yamada and Marui, made fun of him

581
00:29:37,990 --> 00:29:39,990
That he fell to his death

582
00:29:40,640 --> 00:29:45,330
And so, she wanted to kill everyone involved on that day

583
00:29:46,260 --> 00:29:50,230
With Miyu's confession, the incident came to an end...

584
00:29:50,840 --> 00:29:54,640
Please atone for your sins

585
00:29:54,640 --> 00:29:58,280
When you get out, i'll be happy to do more location shoots with you

586
00:29:57,330 --> 00:29:59,380
It's like a closing statement

587
00:29:58,280 --> 00:30:02,350
Miyu, you must turn yourself in

588
00:30:02,010 --> 00:30:04,970
Can they still shoot together...?

589
00:30:02,350 --> 00:30:06,950
Please atone properly for your sins
-Miyu Ito!

590
00:30:08,020 --> 00:30:09,450
Ah, ah, the police

591
00:30:09,450 --> 00:30:12,390
I'm arresting you on suspicion of murder.
-Oh, that was fast

592
00:30:13,580 --> 00:30:17,250
That's it. That's the end of it

593
00:30:18,030 --> 00:30:20,330
Tsuda.
-Yes?

594
00:30:20,330 --> 00:30:21,300
You've done a great service

595
00:30:22,100 --> 00:30:23,970
No no. It's sad...

596
00:30:23,970 --> 00:30:25,740
A sad turn of events

597
00:30:25,970 --> 00:30:31,840
If another incident occurs, please continue to assist us

598
00:30:33,040 --> 00:30:39,720
Well, please don't get me involved again

599
00:30:39,720 --> 00:30:46,650
In Summary
Look forward to Detective Tsuda's next case

600
00:30:47,410 --> 00:30:49,430
Well well well

601
00:30:49,430 --> 00:30:51,890
The famous detective Tsuda

602
00:30:51,890 --> 00:30:53,230
What do you think, Goto?

603
00:30:53,230 --> 00:30:55,220
Very interesting

604
00:30:55,220 --> 00:30:59,840
There's a part of me that was simply curious as to how it was going to play out

605
00:30:59,840 --> 00:31:02,570
As well as seeing Tsuda get more and more into it

606
00:31:02,570 --> 00:31:07,170
Hamada called out, "Oh yeah, the notes he got the day before"

607
00:31:07,170 --> 00:31:10,840
This guy really enjoyed it!

608
00:31:11,490 --> 00:31:12,500
What do you think, Matsumoto?

609
00:31:13,280 --> 00:31:14,620
I hated it

610
00:31:16,450 --> 00:31:18,660
Tsuda's just no good

611
00:31:18,660 --> 00:31:19,490
The main character isn't very good

612
00:31:19,490 --> 00:31:22,520
The main character's no good. He's too noisy

613
00:31:22,520 --> 00:31:24,840
The ending didn't conclude very smoothly either

614
00:31:24,840 --> 00:31:26,260
True

615
00:31:26,260 --> 00:31:31,700
But there was a lot of hints. They kept repeating things

616
00:31:32,070 --> 00:31:35,140
It's like a game where you repeat the same line over and over again

617
00:31:37,190 --> 00:31:39,770
Let's welcome the next presenter

618
00:31:42,030 --> 00:31:42,980
Who is it?

619
00:31:46,420 --> 00:31:49,700
Einstein!

620
00:31:52,660 --> 00:31:56,830
Appearing from that side is really scary
-Yes, indeed

621
00:31:57,230 --> 00:31:59,630
It's like a month's worth of food

622
00:31:59,630 --> 00:32:01,330
It's been a long time, everyone.
-Long time no see

623
00:32:01,330 --> 00:32:05,600
Protruding chin, tiny glasses, chronic rhinitis, thinning hair

624
00:32:05,600 --> 00:32:06,970
I'm everyone's jaw, Itada

625
00:32:06,970 --> 00:32:08,820
What the hell?
-What are you reciting?

626
00:32:08,820 --> 00:32:10,070
What was that?

627
00:32:10,070 --> 00:32:12,340
Well, recently.
-Can you tell me what you're gonna say in advance?

628
00:32:15,920 --> 00:32:17,840
Speaking of which
-Yes

629
00:32:17,840 --> 00:32:20,820
Have you been told you have bad breath lately?

630
00:32:20,820 --> 00:32:23,590
That's why you're hosting?

631
00:32:25,400 --> 00:32:29,420
That's too much information. I'll do it.
-Is that okay?

632
00:32:29,420 --> 00:32:32,800
So, have you ever been told you have a bad breath?

633
00:32:32,800 --> 00:32:37,590
No, and I've been wearing a mask lately.
-Yeah

634
00:32:38,210 --> 00:32:42,150
Today we have a hypothesis about bad breath. Here it is

635
00:32:43,020 --> 00:32:50,250
Even if you eat a lot of garlic and meet someone, it's surprisingly difficult for someone to point out

636
00:32:50,250 --> 00:32:52,600
Yes, it's very possible

637
00:32:53,400 --> 00:32:55,390
Would you say anything, Ano?

638
00:32:55,390 --> 00:32:58,460
I don't think so

639
00:32:58,460 --> 00:33:04,090
If I tell them they smell, they'll be hurt.
-That's right

640
00:33:04,090 --> 00:33:07,120
Considerate people don't say such things

641
00:33:07,120 --> 00:33:08,950
Hamada looks like the type to say it

642
00:33:09,500 --> 00:33:11,000
What do you mean?

643
00:33:11,530 --> 00:33:14,190
Like you'd say it even if it didn't stink

644
00:33:14,970 --> 00:33:25,540
Even if you eat a lot of garlic and meet someone, it's surprisingly difficult for someone to point out

645
00:33:25,540 --> 00:33:31,550
We want you to conduct a surprise interview after eating garlic

646
00:33:33,220 --> 00:33:36,140
Will there be a camera?
-Yes

647
00:33:36,730 --> 00:33:41,100
You can choose where and who you want to interview.
-Okay

648
00:33:41,100 --> 00:33:47,200
It only ends when the other person says, "Did you eat garlic?" or "Garlic stinks"

649
00:33:47,200 --> 00:33:50,640
You have to get the person to say the word "garlic."
-Yes

650
00:33:50,640 --> 00:33:58,930
So, we get the three of them to eat these garlic-filled dishes right away

651
00:34:00,780 --> 00:34:02,750
Whoa

652
00:34:03,780 --> 00:34:07,990
I can clearly smell the flavor in my mouth after eating garlic chips

653
00:34:08,360 --> 00:34:12,960
I'll just focus on the garlic chips

654
00:34:12,960 --> 00:34:15,630
We'll just have to go straight to this

655
00:34:15,630 --> 00:34:18,600
They'll surely realize

656
00:34:20,170 --> 00:34:23,170
It's not going to affect my work after, right?

657
00:34:23,170 --> 00:34:26,710
I'm gonna freestyle with a rapper

658
00:34:25,330 --> 00:34:27,010
What kind of job is this?

659
00:34:27,010 --> 00:34:32,280
For a supposed TBS year-end special

660
00:34:33,220 --> 00:34:39,340
The unannounced interview will be "What's was your toughest job in 2022?"

661
00:34:39,340 --> 00:34:40,620
Seems like a real thing

662
00:34:40,460 --> 00:34:46,560
As long as the person points out the problem in the interview, it's a pass

663
00:34:45,380 --> 00:34:48,960
Just find a senior

664
00:34:49,170 --> 00:34:52,400
It stinks

665
00:34:52,900 --> 00:34:57,100
If it was the other way around Fujimon would definitely say something

666
00:34:57,600 --> 00:35:01,820
So, Fujimon and Iguchi roam TBS

667
00:35:02,700 --> 00:35:06,410
While Komiya heads to the Yoshimoto Head Office

668
00:35:06,410 --> 00:35:09,900
They split up to find interviewees

669
00:35:11,170 --> 00:35:12,680
At this time

670
00:35:14,360 --> 00:35:16,460
Okay, okay, okay. Here it is

671
00:35:16,460 --> 00:35:20,950
Suddenly, Magical Lovely are found while filming Love It!

672
00:35:22,760 --> 00:35:26,770
However, it is necessary to keep a certain distance from the other person during the interview

673
00:35:26,770 --> 00:35:30,370
No perverse proximity

674
00:35:30,370 --> 00:35:34,580
The subject of the interview is what was the hardest job you ever experienced

675
00:35:34,580 --> 00:35:37,350
Filming at a ski resort in just a pair of shorts

676
00:35:37,350 --> 00:35:41,950
Yeah, the ski resort. It was like an indoor ski resort

677
00:35:42,350 --> 00:35:46,590
In just a pair of shorts

678
00:35:43,070 --> 00:35:45,360
Seems they can kind of smell it

679
00:35:45,360 --> 00:35:47,090
Obvious smell

680
00:35:47,090 --> 00:35:54,650
The smell of garlic quickly gave Murakami the impression that something was wrong

681
00:35:53,080 --> 00:35:55,440
Bathing in the smell of garlic

682
00:35:55,730 --> 00:35:57,730
Anything else? Noda?

683
00:35:57,730 --> 00:36:04,110
Ended up with a bad result when doing SASUKE

684
00:36:05,410 --> 00:36:07,410
You've been practicing, haven't you?
-I've been practicing

685
00:36:07,410 --> 00:36:13,220
I'm trying to build muscle for SASUKE, to practice, to learn, to challenge

686
00:36:13,220 --> 00:36:14,750
Where did you get to?

687
00:36:14,550 --> 00:36:17,170
Murakami has gone completely silent

688
00:36:14,750 --> 00:36:16,450
Well...

689
00:36:16,450 --> 00:36:17,820
Not the beginning

690
00:36:17,820 --> 00:36:21,290
I can't believe I went out so fast.
-Went down so early

691
00:36:22,310 --> 00:36:26,770
Murakami is very bothered by Fujimoto's bad breath

692
00:36:28,100 --> 00:36:34,740
But it wasn't pointed out until the end of the interview

693
00:36:36,840 --> 00:36:38,270
Okay. Okay

694
00:36:43,810 --> 00:36:45,220
No, no, no. No more

695
00:36:45,520 --> 00:36:48,550
What did you eat yesterday?

696
00:36:48,890 --> 00:36:50,620
What did you eat yesterday?
-You realized?

697
00:36:50,750 --> 00:36:52,920
Did you eat garlic?

698
00:36:52,920 --> 00:36:56,590
Why didn't you say that? Why didn't you say that?

699
00:36:57,060 --> 00:36:58,930
There's a camera recording

700
00:36:59,060 --> 00:37:00,930
I thought it was your normal state

701
00:37:00,930 --> 00:37:02,370
What do you mean by "normal"?

702
00:37:02,570 --> 00:37:04,800
I thought it was common

703
00:37:05,040 --> 00:37:09,270
On the other side, Iguchi captured this trio

704
00:37:09,270 --> 00:37:15,930
They said they wanted to be weighed, but they're both 106kg

705
00:37:15,930 --> 00:37:17,610
I couldn't

706
00:37:17,610 --> 00:37:20,120
106
-Yes

707
00:37:20,120 --> 00:37:23,010
It was very traumatizing, and they're still the same weight

708
00:37:23,610 --> 00:37:28,020
Not even pointed out at the end

709
00:37:28,020 --> 00:37:29,330
I thought it was Anri

710
00:37:29,330 --> 00:37:31,830
I just finished.
-What a mess

711
00:37:31,830 --> 00:37:33,800
All mixed up.
-Yeah

712
00:37:33,800 --> 00:37:35,900
Why have you just eaten?

713
00:37:36,140 --> 00:37:41,060
The same goes for Komiya who met Yasushi Ishida at the Yoshimoto Head Office

714
00:37:39,130 --> 00:37:40,910
A big senior

715
00:37:41,800 --> 00:37:43,440
Something stinks

716
00:37:44,310 --> 00:37:47,910
You knew it.
-Yes, but it's not polite to say that on a first meeting

717
00:37:47,910 --> 00:37:49,680
There's a reason for that, too

718
00:37:50,060 --> 00:37:57,880
All three groups smelt it, but it was still hard to get them to point it out

719
00:37:57,390 --> 00:37:59,320
If you're not close, you won't say anything

720
00:37:59,320 --> 00:38:04,340
At this point, the next thing Fujimoto saw was

721
00:38:04,340 --> 00:38:09,570
Ishida seems like he's going to laugh and comment

722
00:38:04,490 --> 00:38:06,160
Got one
-Yes, hello

723
00:38:07,260 --> 00:38:09,860
NON STYLE's Ishida

724
00:38:10,470 --> 00:38:13,080
One that you found hard
-Physically tiring

725
00:38:13,080 --> 00:38:18,510
There was an Osaka Castle Dream Festival that lasted 9 days

726
00:38:18,510 --> 00:38:19,940
Yes, yes, yes, yes

727
00:38:19,940 --> 00:38:24,180
I did 54 shows in nine days

728
00:38:24,180 --> 00:38:27,620
Fifty-four?

729
00:38:28,890 --> 00:38:30,490
The stinky "54" is flying out

730
00:38:30,590 --> 00:38:33,090
I was on so many

731
00:38:33,090 --> 00:38:35,160
It was super exhausting

732
00:38:35,160 --> 00:38:40,120
54
-54

733
00:38:39,450 --> 00:38:40,870
So exaggerated

734
00:38:40,690 --> 00:38:44,150
Despite increasing in an attempt to elicit a response

735
00:38:45,210 --> 00:38:48,300
This time the other side didn't point it out either

736
00:38:48,670 --> 00:38:50,270
Is your nose clogged?

737
00:38:50,890 --> 00:38:55,240
I have paranasal sinusitis
-An infection?

738
00:38:54,370 --> 00:38:55,670
Didn't realize

739
00:38:55,670 --> 00:39:05,560
Then they found Alco&Peace, Gerard, and New York

740
00:39:06,090 --> 00:39:08,790
Shinya is about 40kg for three people

741
00:39:09,090 --> 00:39:13,100
It doesn't even look like they're going to point it out

742
00:39:14,700 --> 00:39:20,370
So, Iguchi ate five more chunks of garlic

743
00:39:20,370 --> 00:39:22,010
Hello

744
00:39:23,110 --> 00:39:24,410
Mukai's here

745
00:39:24,330 --> 00:39:26,020
Doesn't look like the type

746
00:39:25,240 --> 00:39:29,490
A member of Panther is encountered while recording

747
00:39:29,810 --> 00:39:33,200
It feels like you've done a lot of work.
-Sort of

748
00:39:33,200 --> 00:39:35,750
Outside.
-Yes, yes, yes

749
00:39:35,750 --> 00:39:38,420
The studio, and all these broadcasts

750
00:39:38,420 --> 00:39:43,330
Broadcasting is the toughest

751
00:39:43,330 --> 00:39:46,000
Don't you think something stinks?

752
00:39:46,000 --> 00:39:47,630
Don't you think something stinks?

753
00:39:47,630 --> 00:39:49,430
What do you mean, what's going on?

754
00:39:49,430 --> 00:39:50,970
Stinks!

755
00:39:50,970 --> 00:39:52,300
What? What stench?

756
00:39:52,500 --> 00:39:54,670
It stinks

757
00:39:54,670 --> 00:39:55,740
What? Sorry, sorry, sorry

758
00:39:56,010 --> 00:39:57,710
What? What stench?

759
00:39:57,840 --> 00:40:00,180
Garlic odor
-Garlic odor?

760
00:40:00,930 --> 00:40:02,370
Yeah!

761
00:40:02,370 --> 00:40:04,110
Oh, its you
-Stinky! Stinky! Stinky!

762
00:40:04,110 --> 00:40:06,010
Thank you
-Stinks so much

763
00:40:06,580 --> 00:40:11,380
So, finally some success

764
00:40:12,260 --> 00:40:15,730
Truth Revealed

765
00:40:13,270 --> 00:40:15,730
It's also surprisingly difficult to say "have you eaten garlic?"

766
00:40:16,730 --> 00:40:19,700
No no, its too much

767
00:40:19,700 --> 00:40:21,730
You'd have to say it

768
00:40:21,730 --> 00:40:26,770
Honestly, I couldn't even listen to what he was saying

769
00:40:27,210 --> 00:40:30,960
Elsewhere with Komiya

770
00:40:31,640 --> 00:40:33,480
He found Rice

771
00:40:32,800 --> 00:40:34,560
Sekimachi is just like a middle-aged woman

772
00:40:35,620 --> 00:40:37,690
Are you trying to popularize that line from the beginning?

773
00:40:37,690 --> 00:40:39,930
I've been doing it for about 5 years or so

774
00:40:39,930 --> 00:40:41,810
Really?

775
00:40:41,810 --> 00:40:45,090
Maybe the next time we come back will be two years from now, so I have to try

776
00:40:47,030 --> 00:40:48,130
It had to be said

777
00:40:48,260 --> 00:40:51,960
What was your toughest job?

778
00:40:51,960 --> 00:40:53,460
Probably LIVE STAND

779
00:40:55,700 --> 00:41:01,170
Yoshimoto's big comedy festival, LIVE STAND

780
00:40:58,570 --> 00:41:00,420
Touching their noses

781
00:41:01,170 --> 00:41:04,610
Comedy festival

782
00:41:02,530 --> 00:41:04,220
What's up?

783
00:41:04,610 --> 00:41:06,380
Doesn't it stink?

784
00:41:06,380 --> 00:41:07,260
It stinks

785
00:41:07,260 --> 00:41:08,850
Do you stink, Komiya, or is it outside?

786
00:41:08,850 --> 00:41:10,410
Yeah? Is it outside?

787
00:41:10,780 --> 00:41:17,420
It's hard... "LIVE STAND" in front of thousands of people!

788
00:41:18,290 --> 00:41:20,960
It stinks. Wait

789
00:41:22,020 --> 00:41:23,290
It stinks so bad I can't even talk

790
00:41:23,290 --> 00:41:24,530
Also

791
00:41:24,760 --> 00:41:27,140
Did you eat the garlic?

792
00:41:27,140 --> 00:41:28,700
Yeah!

793
00:41:29,120 --> 00:41:33,780
So Komiya also managed to pass

794
00:41:32,620 --> 00:41:35,290
Everyone's so fast

795
00:41:35,140 --> 00:41:39,840
Komiya's a good choice since he's a junior

796
00:41:39,210 --> 00:41:41,210
Yeah, it depends on the person

797
00:41:40,200 --> 00:41:45,240
As expected, both groups commented on their juniors

798
00:41:45,240 --> 00:41:46,520
I'd say it to my juniors

799
00:41:46,520 --> 00:41:54,860
Fujimoto, a veteran with few seniors to talk to easily, is in a dangerous situation

800
00:41:56,530 --> 00:41:59,960
You're a senior, it can't be said

801
00:42:00,400 --> 00:42:05,770
Next, we met Kasuga, who wanted to say something, but the result was the same

802
00:42:05,770 --> 00:42:07,120
Nowadays

803
00:42:08,560 --> 00:42:12,660
The other guy didn't even flinch

804
00:42:14,340 --> 00:42:19,280
I won't eat garlic, i'll put it in

805
00:42:19,880 --> 00:42:24,450
After the garlic, Fujimoto's next target is...

806
00:42:24,750 --> 00:42:26,770
Okay, here we go
You scared the shit out of me

807
00:42:26,770 --> 00:42:28,390
Scared me

808
00:42:28,220 --> 00:42:29,700
He'll say it

809
00:42:28,970 --> 00:42:33,400
Despite being a junior, we have high hopes for Daisuke Miyagawa

810
00:42:33,400 --> 00:42:36,130
He'll surely say something

811
00:42:36,430 --> 00:42:39,040
He's got to say something

812
00:42:39,300 --> 00:42:41,000
Hello
-Hello, what's up?

813
00:42:41,000 --> 00:42:44,170
Daisuke, it's been a long time, hasn't it?
-Long time no see

814
00:42:44,170 --> 00:42:45,170
You scared me. What's going on?

815
00:42:46,450 --> 00:42:48,180
It's a TBS year-end special.
-What?

816
00:42:49,210 --> 00:42:51,270
Can I interview you?
-Yes

817
00:42:52,210 --> 00:42:55,520
Wait, can I tell you something?
-What?

818
00:42:55,520 --> 00:42:57,050
Sorry

819
00:42:57,050 --> 00:43:00,520
Of all the jobs you've had this year.
-Stinks, what is that?

820
00:43:00,520 --> 00:43:02,260
Seriously, what's going on?

821
00:43:02,260 --> 00:43:03,890
What?
-Don't you smell the stench?

822
00:43:03,890 --> 00:43:06,330
Stink? What?

823
00:43:09,330 --> 00:43:11,430
What's wrong?
It stinks

824
00:43:13,140 --> 00:43:14,100
No, I'm sorry

825
00:43:14,170 --> 00:43:15,320
Daisuke you...

826
00:43:16,210 --> 00:43:18,240
It stinks! What's that smell? It stinks!

827
00:43:18,240 --> 00:43:20,280
It stinks, doesn't it?
-What?

828
00:43:20,410 --> 00:43:22,550
It stinks too much
-Let me do the interview

829
00:43:22,550 --> 00:43:25,180
What? I'm pissed off

830
00:43:25,180 --> 00:43:26,750
What's the problem?
-It stinks

831
00:43:29,250 --> 00:43:29,890
What are you laughing at?

832
00:43:29,890 --> 00:43:35,060
You're definitely bad. You've got stomach problems. You're overworked. Your breath stinks

833
00:43:35,060 --> 00:43:37,130
Stand up. What do you look like?
-I'm serious

834
00:43:37,290 --> 00:43:40,360
Stop talking for a second

835
00:43:40,360 --> 00:43:42,230
Why is that?
-Your mouth stinks

836
00:43:42,230 --> 00:43:44,700
What? Can an interviewer be like this you asshole?

837
00:43:44,700 --> 00:43:45,530
That's too much!

838
00:43:45,530 --> 00:43:47,600
It is, but it just stinks

839
00:43:47,600 --> 00:43:49,870
I just smelled it and I almost threw up

840
00:43:49,870 --> 00:43:51,310
What's this?
-Agh!

841
00:43:51,310 --> 00:43:54,180
You're so rude

842
00:43:54,180 --> 00:43:56,350
No, no, it's not right. It's not right. It's not right

843
00:43:56,350 --> 00:43:58,610
No, no, no, no, no

844
00:43:58,610 --> 00:44:01,450
It stinks. Seriously, what?

845
00:44:01,450 --> 00:44:02,520
What the hell?
-Something's wrong.

846
00:44:02,520 --> 00:44:06,590
Tell me what your hardest job has been

847
00:44:08,760 --> 00:44:10,790
Let me think

848
00:44:10,790 --> 00:44:12,630
Yeah...

849
00:44:12,630 --> 00:44:13,630
"Yeah" stinks

850
00:44:15,530 --> 00:44:16,700
No, no, no

851
00:44:16,700 --> 00:44:19,170
Seriously, what did you eat? Seriously, what the hell?

852
00:44:19,170 --> 00:44:22,610
Can I have one breath please?

853
00:44:28,680 --> 00:44:30,150
It stinks

854
00:44:30,150 --> 00:44:31,710
Garlic and meat?

855
00:44:31,880 --> 00:44:35,380
He said it!

856
00:44:36,350 --> 00:44:38,390
He said it!
-What are you doing here?

857
00:44:38,990 --> 00:44:43,480
So Fujimoto finally passed after the sixth try

858
00:44:44,260 --> 00:44:47,560
Daisuke, you're the first to point it out.
-No way

859
00:44:47,560 --> 00:44:50,570
Probably because i've been speaking to juniors

860
00:44:50,570 --> 00:44:52,700
But if you think about it, you're a junior too

861
00:44:52,700 --> 00:44:54,770
When I think about it, he's a junior too

862
00:44:54,770 --> 00:44:55,640
Excuse me

863
00:44:55,640 --> 00:45:00,370
In summary
The juniors basically don't point out problems

864
00:45:00,370 --> 00:45:02,610
Very fun

865
00:45:02,610 --> 00:45:05,640
Why is it so funny to see people get hit by bad smells?

866
00:45:05,640 --> 00:45:06,850
Yeah, really

867
00:45:06,850 --> 00:45:09,600
Daisuke's reaction was very funny

868
00:45:09,600 --> 00:45:12,420
I met Fujimoto on that day

869
00:45:12,420 --> 00:45:15,070
Just wandering round the TV station

870
00:45:15,070 --> 00:45:17,300
You met him while they were filming?

871
00:45:17,300 --> 00:45:19,490
He stank
-Really?

872
00:45:19,490 --> 00:45:20,370
Did you say anything?

873
00:45:20,370 --> 00:45:25,260
When I met him, I greeted him

874
00:45:25,260 --> 00:45:30,550
I said something smelled bad, and he said, "Don't worry, its because of Wednesday Downtown"

875
00:45:30,550 --> 00:45:32,540
He explained

876
00:45:32,540 --> 00:45:35,660
I thought you wouldn't say anything

877
00:45:36,730 --> 00:45:38,660
That's a good point

878
00:45:38,660 --> 00:45:42,340
Even I would say it stinks

879
00:45:43,220 --> 00:46:14,750
