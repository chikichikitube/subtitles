1
00:00:02,600 --> 00:00:06,300
Tonight at the arena, a huge audience became electrified by the

2
00:00:06,300 --> 00:00:08,900
Unbeatable champion Moriman

3
00:00:10,700 --> 00:00:13,900
And the man, who has never yet been victorious, the eternal challenger

4
00:00:13,900 --> 00:00:17,600
Yamasaki Hosei's revenge match

5
00:00:18,500 --> 00:00:22,600
This time, despite Yamasaki's persuasion, he failed several times

6
00:00:22,600 --> 00:00:24,500
Pantyhose removal match

7
00:00:24,500 --> 00:00:26,500
Beer smashing showdown

8
00:00:28,000 --> 00:00:30,300
Gobou stick match

9
00:00:33,300 --> 00:00:38,300
And also piping hot soup battle. All of the showdowns were a disastrous failure to him.

10
00:00:38,300 --> 00:00:41,300
Champion Moriman was destroying him

11
00:00:42,000 --> 00:00:48,900
Tonight, the scenes that no one saw before with the fighters will be shown

12
00:00:50,900 --> 00:00:55,200
Yamazaki vs Moriman Storming Last Final Revenge Match the second part

13
00:01:08,900 --> 00:01:12,800
I think Happosai ended at every home

14
00:01:13,600 --> 00:01:17,200
After the end of the "pipng-hot Happosai showdown",

15
00:01:17,200 --> 00:01:18,800
Matsumoto-san, I don't want to say this

16
00:01:18,800 --> 00:01:21,200
But we can't do Happosai battle anymore

17
00:01:21,800 --> 00:01:24,700
Fine, then let's go with "cheese fondue"?

18
00:01:28,800 --> 00:01:29,800
I will do my best!

19
00:01:32,000 --> 00:01:33,700
Be more careful

20
00:01:34,500 --> 00:01:36,200
Next time I will

21
00:01:37,500 --> 00:01:40,200
"Flaming hot cheese fondue" showdown

22
00:01:41,000 --> 00:01:43,400
There's so much of it

23
00:01:49,100 --> 00:01:50,400
So, it started!

24
00:02:15,000 --> 00:02:16,100
Yamasaki-san

25
00:02:16,900 --> 00:02:19,800
Moriman was all in bread crumbs

26
00:02:22,800 --> 00:02:24,000
And in cheese

27
00:02:24,000 --> 00:02:28,900
When he was throwing bread at Moriman, he was so sloppy

28
00:02:31,500 --> 00:02:33,000
Volleyball showdown

29
00:02:36,500 --> 00:02:38,000
VOLLEYBALL SHOWDOWN!!!!

30
00:02:43,000 --> 00:02:45,400
"Volleyball showdown" fight

31
00:02:46,200 --> 00:02:47,300
Let's start!

32
00:02:47,300 --> 00:02:49,200
Volleyball match

33
00:02:55,500 --> 00:02:56,300
Go, go, go!

34
00:03:00,700 --> 00:03:01,800
Here it comes!

35
00:03:02,000 --> 00:03:03,500
He should concentrate

36
00:03:11,000 --> 00:03:12,100
The hell you're doing?

37
00:03:34,000 --> 00:03:36,300
You were so close, Yamasaki san

38
00:03:37,000 --> 00:03:39,300
What have you been doing? Volleyball ball is over there!

39
00:03:39,300 --> 00:03:41,200
What happened?

40
00:03:41,200 --> 00:03:42,500
I'M DONE!!!

41
00:03:47,300 --> 00:03:49,000
What are you doing?

42
00:03:49,000 --> 00:03:49,900
MORIMAN!!!

43
00:03:50,000 --> 00:03:52,700
Alright, "honey battle"!

44
00:04:01,000 --> 00:04:04,400
In the "honey showdown" one shall dip opponent's head

45
00:04:05,000 --> 00:04:05,800
Alright, let's start!

46
00:04:07,600 --> 00:04:08,300
Here it comes!

47
00:04:08,300 --> 00:04:10,300
~Yamasaki! Do your Best!~

48
00:04:54,400 --> 00:04:56,100
What was with that hand?

49
00:04:57,300 --> 00:04:58,600
What does this hand mean?

50
00:04:59,300 --> 00:05:01,000
He got covered in honey that much

51
00:05:02,300 --> 00:05:04,800
I was very surprised

52
00:05:09,200 --> 00:05:11,300
That was so fast

53
00:05:11,300 --> 00:05:12,400
Will you be able to go on?

54
00:05:12,400 --> 00:05:13,900
Yes, I can

55
00:05:17,500 --> 00:05:19,500
Is it alright to rematch?

56
00:05:22,500 --> 00:05:25,400
It sounds perfectly fine

57
00:05:25,400 --> 00:05:27,400
Did you expect us to refuse?

58
00:05:27,400 --> 00:05:30,200
When we look at your head, so much stuck to it

59
00:05:36,000 --> 00:05:37,500
"Honey head-dipping match" Round 2

60
00:05:42,500 --> 00:05:44,500
There is no way for him to escape

61
00:05:54,000 --> 00:05:56,600
He can't see, can't see

62
00:05:57,000 --> 00:05:58,600
Completely blinded

63
00:06:07,000 --> 00:06:08,700
Oh, he went for a swept-back hairstyle

64
00:06:10,000 --> 00:06:11,300
He looks like Bond now

65
00:06:30,000 --> 00:06:30,800
Wait a moment

66
00:06:32,800 --> 00:06:33,400
Listen,

67
00:06:34,600 --> 00:06:36,600
How much stuff did stick to you?

68
00:06:36,600 --> 00:06:40,300
Yamasaki san, are you alright?

69
00:06:41,500 --> 00:06:46,000
I don't get it. I think he meant wants to stop it.

70
00:06:46,000 --> 00:06:49,700
For some reason he now tried to hold onto her

71
00:06:50,300 --> 00:06:52,200
What was the purpose of it?

72
00:06:52,700 --> 00:06:56,100
This round someone will definitely win this match

73
00:06:57,000 --> 00:06:58,800
Please give me a real match!

74
00:07:01,000 --> 00:07:04,700
We've seen it before. You don't seem like you really want to do it

75
00:07:05,000 --> 00:07:06,700
Understood. It's a promise

76
00:07:06,700 --> 00:07:09,200
Let it be "K-1 showdown"

77
00:07:10,500 --> 00:07:12,400
K-1 SHOWDOWN!

78
00:07:13,300 --> 00:07:16,300
The match is in earnest now, - "K-1 showdown"

79
00:07:17,000 --> 00:07:18,300
Let's commence!

80
00:08:01,000 --> 00:08:06,500
Somehow Yamasaki managed to knock Moriman down. What is going to happen next?

81
00:08:26,500 --> 00:08:29,800
He just fell here

82
00:08:30,000 --> 00:08:31,800
However, just before he was full of excitement

83
00:08:34,000 --> 00:08:38,900
Without expecting anything he was just knocked out

84
00:08:38,900 --> 00:08:40,900
EVERYONE!!!!

85
00:08:41,400 --> 00:08:42,700
HOW DID YOU LIKE IT???

86
00:08:47,800 --> 00:08:48,900
MORIMAN!!!

87
00:08:50,000 --> 00:08:52,500
TODAY WAS THE LAST MATCH!!!!

88
00:08:52,500 --> 00:08:54,500
NEXT TIME!!!

89
00:08:54,500 --> 00:08:56,500
NEXT MATCH!!!

90
00:09:04,100 --> 00:09:06,000
His throat got tired from talking

91
00:09:08,000 --> 00:09:11,300
And with that, Yamasaki ran away from the ring

92
00:09:12,500 --> 00:09:14,800
Then Cocorico ran after him

93
00:09:18,200 --> 00:09:23,300
Ladies and Gentlemen, I think he lost all of his strength

94
00:09:23,300 --> 00:09:26,400
And that's why this time...

95
00:09:38,800 --> 00:09:40,100
~Hamada-san are you alright?~

96
00:09:49,200 --> 00:09:51,800
What happened to you? Did you answer wrong at the quiz show?

97
00:09:54,800 --> 00:09:57,900
Did someone press a fail button?

98
00:10:02,700 --> 00:10:03,700
Cocorico!

99
00:10:03,700 --> 00:10:08,200
And then, 10 minutes after Yamasaki's escape, Endo returns

100
00:10:08,400 --> 00:10:12,000
Will Yamasaki return back to the ring again?

101
00:10:12,000 --> 00:10:14,800
Or is it the end?

102
00:10:14,800 --> 00:10:16,800
Ladies and gentlemen, please listen

103
00:10:19,200 --> 00:10:27,500
Yamasaki-san said in purpose of his advantage,he won't be returning

104
00:10:31,000 --> 00:10:33,100
Endo, that's no good

105
00:10:33,200 --> 00:10:33,900
However!

106
00:10:35,800 --> 00:10:43,900
Although, he's not returning. Tanaka on Cocorico's behalf will perform before you at this New Year's Eve.

107
00:10:43,900 --> 00:10:44,800
Tanaka, come in!!!
