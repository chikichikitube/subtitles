1
00:00:24,350 --> 00:00:27,100
When comedians get married and have a wedding ceremony

2
00:00:27,100 --> 00:00:31,990
It will be loud and boisterous, with other comedians messing around and making fun of each other

3
00:00:31,990 --> 00:00:35,750
Say cheese, okay

4
00:00:36,520 --> 00:00:38,840
Can I take another one?

5
00:00:38,840 --> 00:00:42,750
However, I never feel comfortable in those situations

6
00:00:42,750 --> 00:00:49,700
So this contest is like a wedding ceremony without the bride and the bridegroom

7
00:00:49,700 --> 00:00:51,660
Is that glue?

8
00:00:51,660 --> 00:00:54,140
Norika? Did you say Norika just now?

9
00:00:54,140 --> 00:00:56,530
He clearly said it

10
00:00:56,530 --> 00:00:58,050
I've always been watching this

11
00:00:58,050 --> 00:01:05,770
And since I love egosearching, whenever I see questions like "who should be the next Documental contestants"

12
00:01:05,770 --> 00:01:07,650
My name always appears in the answer

13
00:01:10,980 --> 00:01:12,590
Apple pen

14
00:01:15,350 --> 00:01:18,140
So I always wonder why am I not invited yet?

15
00:01:18,140 --> 00:01:20,310
I've been waiting for this

16
00:01:20,310 --> 00:01:22,600
I've always been waiting for this!

17
00:01:29,410 --> 00:01:34,000
I'm more used to do owarai with others together

18
00:01:34,000 --> 00:01:38,950
So I'm worried that my type of owarai may not be effective here

19
00:01:38,950 --> 00:01:46,620
I have to complement the things that others did, either purposely or accidentally

20
00:01:46,620 --> 00:01:51,970
He loves fishing, so maybe he wants fish sausages instead

21
00:01:57,510 --> 00:02:00,330
Of course I want others to think that I'm interesting

22
00:02:00,330 --> 00:02:03,180
Or else, this contest is just too tough to bear

23
00:02:03,180 --> 00:02:07,720
Paying 100 million to join a contest that no one thinks you're interesting, that's too tough right?

24
00:03:28,200 --> 00:03:30,030
Orange!

25
00:03:34,170 --> 00:03:37,700
Don't put your arm around my waist

26
00:03:45,530 --> 00:03:47,870
This is double kill

27
00:03:49,940 --> 00:03:52,490
Is it necessary to put on that much?   -What the heck is this?

28
00:03:52,490 --> 00:03:54,030
What a gentle penis

29
00:04:04,260 --> 00:04:06,930
OUT!!

30
00:04:21,310 --> 00:04:23,910
Eh?   -Do you need some more?

31
00:04:23,910 --> 00:04:26,060
You want to put more?   -Is it enough?

32
00:04:26,060 --> 00:04:27,990
Yeah, this is more than enough

33
00:04:27,990 --> 00:04:30,220
It's easier to remove with more wax   -Eh? You must be kidding

34
00:04:30,220 --> 00:04:32,220
Yeah, it's too hard already

35
00:04:32,220 --> 00:04:33,420
Seriously?

36
00:04:33,420 --> 00:04:37,100
It won't stick anymore

37
00:04:37,100 --> 00:04:38,470
Oh, I see

38
00:04:41,140 --> 00:04:43,820
Ouch, it hurts, ouch, ouch, ouch...

39
00:04:43,820 --> 00:04:46,110
(Aww, I really hate these kind of things)

40
00:04:46,110 --> 00:04:48,400
Can I hide it for a moment?   -Eh?

41
00:04:48,400 --> 00:04:52,770
Can I hide this thing for a moment?   -Ok

42
00:04:52,770 --> 00:04:55,510
It seems to be on the right track

43
00:04:55,510 --> 00:04:58,120
Ouch, ouch, ouch   -It hurts?

44
00:04:58,120 --> 00:05:01,750
I can't believe Tamura-san left this to us

45
00:05:02,380 --> 00:05:04,490
What a terrible present

46
00:05:04,490 --> 00:05:07,720
Better pull it off in one-shot

47
00:05:10,200 --> 00:05:11,330
Please hold his hand

48
00:05:14,160 --> 00:05:15,630
Is this going to be fine?

49
00:05:17,250 --> 00:05:19,070
I don't think this is going to work at all

50
00:05:19,070 --> 00:05:20,200
Just give it a try

51
00:05:20,200 --> 00:05:22,940
Give it a try and finish it in one-shot

52
00:05:23,380 --> 00:05:25,070
Are you ready?

53
00:05:25,070 --> 00:05:26,560
Ready, set...

54
00:05:28,620 --> 00:05:31,000
Wow, it removed a lot

55
00:05:31,000 --> 00:05:32,310
That's amazing!

56
00:05:35,030 --> 00:05:37,780
A joyful harmony

57
00:05:38,610 --> 00:05:40,390
Better pull off the other side too

58
00:05:40,390 --> 00:05:43,140
It removed a lot of hair   -Yeah, incredible

59
00:05:43,140 --> 00:05:45,800
And that was a great harmonica melody too

60
00:05:48,640 --> 00:05:50,120
(But yeah, it removed a lot of hair)

61
00:05:50,120 --> 00:05:51,860
So these are those dots just now

62
00:05:51,860 --> 00:05:54,070
It hurts? It doesn't hurts?

63
00:05:54,070 --> 00:05:56,300
It hurts? It hurts?

64
00:05:56,990 --> 00:05:59,800
It hurts? It doesn't hurts?

65
00:06:00,460 --> 00:06:01,140
It hurts?

66
00:06:01,940 --> 00:06:02,700
It hurts?

67
00:06:02,700 --> 00:06:04,270
You want us to stop this?

68
00:06:04,270 --> 00:06:06,830
No, don't stop

69
00:06:06,830 --> 00:06:10,830
You want to do this?   -(Takahashi...)

70
00:06:10,830 --> 00:06:13,370
Do it?   -"Do it"

71
00:06:13,370 --> 00:06:14,550
Put more?

72
00:06:14,550 --> 00:06:15,820
Do you want to put more?

73
00:06:16,470 --> 00:06:18,130
"Put more"

74
00:06:18,760 --> 00:06:22,130
This is gonna be painful though, Koba

75
00:06:22,130 --> 00:06:22,640
Oh my god...

76
00:06:22,640 --> 00:06:25,440
Will your penis be fine though?

77
00:06:25,440 --> 00:06:28,420
It definitely sticked to his penis

78
00:06:28,420 --> 00:06:30,420
Are you fine with this?

79
00:06:30,420 --> 00:06:31,860
I'll do it

80
00:06:31,860 --> 00:06:34,580
Wait a second, you're holding his pubic hair?

81
00:06:34,580 --> 00:06:36,170
Is it fine to pull if off like this?

82
00:06:36,660 --> 00:06:37,760
He said "no way"

83
00:06:38,920 --> 00:06:40,920
But then this is never going to end

84
00:06:40,920 --> 00:06:42,550
Can he hold your hair?   -Just try it once

85
00:06:42,550 --> 00:06:43,710
Can I hold your hair?

86
00:06:43,710 --> 00:06:45,850
He said "just for once"

87
00:06:45,850 --> 00:06:47,890
"i-kai-da-ke (just for once)"

88
00:06:47,890 --> 00:06:50,280
He said "i-kai-da-ke (just for once)"

89
00:06:50,280 --> 00:06:52,400
"i-kai-da-ke (just for once)"

90
00:06:52,400 --> 00:06:54,240
I'll finish this   -Finish it

91
00:06:54,240 --> 00:06:55,780
Ready, set...

92
00:07:00,810 --> 00:07:03,590
The pain surpassed the harmonica, and we can even hear his voice

93
00:07:03,590 --> 00:07:08,350
What about putting the vibrator here and switch it on, so he can focus on this instead

94
00:07:08,350 --> 00:07:11,950
Oh, I see what you mean   -So to shift his focus

95
00:07:11,950 --> 00:07:13,680
Zakoshi is starting something

96
00:07:18,570 --> 00:07:20,220
Oh, it's on

97
00:07:20,220 --> 00:07:23,690
It's coming, it's coming, I can feel it

98
00:07:26,420 --> 00:07:27,750
-Are you ready?   -Wait a second...

99
00:07:27,750 --> 00:07:30,800
Zakoshi is here

100
00:07:30,990 --> 00:07:33,000
Are you guys still doing it?

101
00:07:33,000 --> 00:07:34,200
You mean this?

102
00:07:34,200 --> 00:07:35,580
Yeah, are you guys still doing it?

103
00:07:52,040 --> 00:07:53,940
He stopped

104
00:07:53,940 --> 00:07:55,400
He stopped all of a sudden

105
00:07:55,400 --> 00:07:58,790
Hey you, touch here, touch here

106
00:07:58,790 --> 00:08:00,040
Touch it?   -Yes, touch here

107
00:08:00,040 --> 00:08:02,640
Why?   -Just touch it

108
00:08:05,410 --> 00:08:07,510
I almost cummed

109
00:08:11,160 --> 00:08:14,780
Touch here, touch here

110
00:08:17,430 --> 00:08:18,880
I almost cummed

111
00:08:30,160 --> 00:08:32,280
I almost cummed

112
00:08:34,330 --> 00:08:36,610
I just cummed

113
00:08:36,610 --> 00:08:39,330
He cummed?

114
00:08:48,610 --> 00:08:49,980
I almost cummed

115
00:08:59,970 --> 00:09:02,390
I almost cummed

116
00:09:07,170 --> 00:09:08,800
-Is he laughing?   -I almost cummed

117
00:09:10,930 --> 00:09:11,910
I almost cummed

118
00:09:14,320 --> 00:09:15,360
I almost cummed

119
00:09:20,040 --> 00:09:22,250
(Nice, nice one)

120
00:09:22,250 --> 00:09:23,780
(Very nice, very nice)

121
00:09:24,150 --> 00:09:26,540
I almost cummed

122
00:09:45,300 --> 00:09:48,230
It was such a tough time

123
00:09:49,370 --> 00:09:52,010
Why didn't he let me cum?

124
00:09:56,930 --> 00:09:59,050
Please let me make a call

125
00:09:59,050 --> 00:10:00,340
Food delivery?

126
00:10:00,340 --> 00:10:04,050
No, someone asked me to call him

127
00:10:05,200 --> 00:10:06,430
For this time

128
00:10:06,430 --> 00:10:10,290
Well, I've been thinking about this for a while

129
00:10:10,290 --> 00:10:12,300
They can invite one helper

130
00:10:12,300 --> 00:10:13,900
Did something happen?

131
00:10:13,900 --> 00:10:16,060
They can ask someone to come

132
00:10:16,060 --> 00:10:21,680
So an outsider will blend into the group

133
00:10:21,680 --> 00:10:25,460
Just like Windom in Ultraseven

134
00:10:25,460 --> 00:10:28,840
A capsule monster, so they can use one capsule

135
00:10:29,640 --> 00:10:32,380
He consulted me

136
00:10:32,380 --> 00:10:34,770
Hello   -Hello

137
00:10:34,770 --> 00:10:35,480
Hey

138
00:10:35,480 --> 00:10:39,760
I've told you about this in LINE already, but I really think you should quit

139
00:10:39,760 --> 00:10:42,390
No, please let me do it again

140
00:10:42,390 --> 00:10:44,650
No, that's impossible

141
00:10:44,650 --> 00:10:47,900
I feel like I have the potential to do this, please let me try once more

142
00:10:47,900 --> 00:10:49,300
It's gonna be tough

143
00:10:49,300 --> 00:10:50,900
I'll work hard, I can do this

144
00:10:50,900 --> 00:10:52,900
That's just your opinion

145
00:10:52,900 --> 00:10:55,430
I can do this, seriously, let me show it to you

146
00:10:55,430 --> 00:10:56,850
Can you come over here now?

147
00:10:56,850 --> 00:10:58,330
I'm nearby, so yes

148
00:10:58,330 --> 00:11:02,800
My seniors are here too, so let's finish this quickly

149
00:11:02,800 --> 00:11:06,220
No problem   -I don't think I'll change my mind though

150
00:11:06,220 --> 00:11:08,710
Got it, I will be right there   -Okay

151
00:11:09,150 --> 00:11:10,830
Sorry for this   -Who's that?

152
00:11:10,830 --> 00:11:13,650
My friend consulted me   -You tell him to quit?

153
00:11:13,650 --> 00:11:15,350
Yeah, I told him to quit, but...

154
00:11:15,350 --> 00:11:17,590
But he still wants to do it?   -Yes

155
00:11:17,590 --> 00:11:19,400
Excuse me, please give us a moment

156
00:11:20,660 --> 00:11:21,870
Who is it?

157
00:11:22,630 --> 00:11:24,400
It's just impossible, honestly

158
00:11:27,740 --> 00:11:33,150
Boxing world titles in three weight classes

159
00:11:27,740 --> 00:11:33,150
Hasegawa Hozumi

160
00:11:33,150 --> 00:11:35,880
I really want to return to professional boxing

161
00:11:35,880 --> 00:11:36,940
I told you that's impossible

162
00:11:36,940 --> 00:11:38,710
I can definitely do this

163
00:11:39,440 --> 00:11:44,780
No way, we're at the same age so I know this, there's just a limit to our stamina

164
00:11:44,780 --> 00:11:48,140
But I really feel like I have the potential to do this

165
00:11:49,680 --> 00:11:51,880
Just for once, please

166
00:11:52,730 --> 00:11:54,690
Fine, show me your moves then

167
00:11:54,690 --> 00:11:56,240
Why is he consulting Yamauchi?

168
00:11:58,800 --> 00:12:01,910
I will test your reflexes, to see if you're qualified

169
00:12:01,910 --> 00:12:04,440
If you can do well, then I'll think about it

170
00:12:06,350 --> 00:12:07,690
Are you ready?

171
00:12:07,690 --> 00:12:09,430
What the heck can you test with that?

172
00:12:09,430 --> 00:12:10,810
Are you ready?

173
00:12:13,560 --> 00:12:14,890
This is meaningless

174
00:12:16,230 --> 00:12:19,330
Hey, this test is meaningless

175
00:12:19,330 --> 00:12:21,910
This test is...completely meaningless

176
00:12:21,910 --> 00:12:23,480
He said it's meaningless

177
00:12:23,480 --> 00:12:25,480
This test is meaningless

178
00:12:25,480 --> 00:12:27,730
But he still completed it

179
00:12:27,730 --> 00:12:30,140
Next, show me your punch

180
00:12:32,340 --> 00:12:33,200
One, two, got it?

181
00:12:33,200 --> 00:12:36,050
Did Yamaguchi boxed before?   -Never heard of it

182
00:12:37,080 --> 00:12:38,200
One, two, got it?

183
00:12:38,840 --> 00:12:39,820
Just like this

184
00:12:40,340 --> 00:12:41,470
Good, okay

185
00:12:41,680 --> 00:12:42,560
One, two, good

186
00:12:42,560 --> 00:12:45,410
Now one, two, and hit my body

187
00:12:45,410 --> 00:12:47,940
Let's see if your punches can do any damage

188
00:12:47,940 --> 00:12:49,010
Take it seriously

189
00:12:49,010 --> 00:12:49,730
Come on

190
00:12:56,610 --> 00:12:57,730
One, two, body

191
00:12:58,540 --> 00:12:59,730
Come on

192
00:13:04,040 --> 00:13:05,050
It's doing damage

193
00:13:05,050 --> 00:13:07,050
Come on, one, two, body

194
00:13:24,580 --> 00:13:25,420
This is amazing

195
00:13:25,420 --> 00:13:28,540
Please stop, better stop this, Yamauchi

196
00:13:28,540 --> 00:13:31,230
Yamauchi, seriously, please...

197
00:13:31,230 --> 00:13:34,080
Just let him return to professional boxing

198
00:13:34,080 --> 00:13:36,000
Hey, Yamauchi...

199
00:13:36,000 --> 00:13:37,600
No, Yamauchi, come on...

200
00:13:37,600 --> 00:13:39,600
Your body is being destroyed

201
00:13:39,600 --> 00:13:41,440
This is incredible

202
00:13:44,900 --> 00:13:46,140
You regained your strength

203
00:13:46,400 --> 00:13:47,500
Can I still do this?

204
00:13:47,500 --> 00:13:49,290
Yeah, I think so

205
00:13:49,290 --> 00:13:50,840
I'll contact you later

206
00:13:50,840 --> 00:13:53,900
Return to professional boxing...let me think about it again

207
00:13:53,900 --> 00:13:56,320
Please contact me again, thanks for your time

208
00:13:56,320 --> 00:13:58,560
This is unbelievable

209
00:14:01,420 --> 00:14:02,720
He's Hozumi-san, right?

210
00:14:02,720 --> 00:14:04,250
How come? Have you boxed before?

211
00:14:04,250 --> 00:14:05,490
Not at all

212
00:14:05,490 --> 00:14:07,290
Not at all?   -Yes

213
00:14:07,290 --> 00:14:08,640
He regained his strength

214
00:14:08,640 --> 00:14:11,730
No way, you don't know about his golden age

215
00:14:11,850 --> 00:14:13,250
He said he wants to do it again, so...

216
00:14:15,940 --> 00:14:18,780
Is this the studio?

217
00:14:18,780 --> 00:14:20,000
Huh?

218
00:14:20,000 --> 00:14:21,220
Is this the studio?

219
00:14:21,220 --> 00:14:23,220
Did I get it wrong?

220
00:14:23,220 --> 00:14:25,650
Well, yes, this is the studio

221
00:14:26,380 --> 00:14:27,800
How can we help you?

222
00:14:27,800 --> 00:14:33,240
I mean, is this the music studio?   -Oh, nope, this is not the music studio

223
00:14:33,240 --> 00:14:36,810
I'm actually a musician

224
00:14:36,810 --> 00:14:39,330
So you guys are not having a music festival here?

225
00:14:39,330 --> 00:14:43,050
Nope, we're not   -Oh, I see

226
00:14:43,050 --> 00:14:46,430
I'm actually a freelance musician now

227
00:14:46,430 --> 00:14:46,920
Okay

228
00:14:46,920 --> 00:14:48,880
I'm self-employed

229
00:14:48,880 --> 00:14:50,710
And I sing whatever comes to my mind

230
00:14:50,710 --> 00:14:52,310
Like a singer-songwriter?

231
00:14:54,240 --> 00:14:56,050
What songs did you write?

232
00:14:56,050 --> 00:14:57,940
Well, the song of order

233
00:14:57,940 --> 00:14:59,050
Order? The song of order?

234
00:14:59,050 --> 00:15:00,770
The song of order

235
00:15:00,770 --> 00:15:01,590
The song of order?

236
00:15:01,590 --> 00:15:04,250
A song that questions the order of things

237
00:15:04,250 --> 00:15:06,160
That's unique   -I wanna hear your song

238
00:15:06,160 --> 00:15:11,130
"Date first then have sex, or have sex first then date", that's what the song is about

239
00:15:11,130 --> 00:15:12,840
Can you sing it for us?

240
00:15:12,840 --> 00:15:17,890
"Date first then have sex, or have sex first then date"

241
00:15:17,890 --> 00:15:23,180
"Date first then have sex, or have sex first then date"

242
00:15:23,180 --> 00:15:24,420
The tempo is like this

243
00:15:26,850 --> 00:15:32,080
"Date first then have sex, or have sex first then date"

244
00:15:33,140 --> 00:15:34,810
That's the song of order

245
00:15:35,370 --> 00:15:37,080
Are there other versions?

246
00:15:37,080 --> 00:15:40,390
Yes, there are, I basically sing the story of people's life

247
00:15:40,390 --> 00:15:41,480
All about order?

248
00:15:41,480 --> 00:15:46,510
Yes, the song of order, "Date first then have sex, or have sex first then date"

249
00:15:46,510 --> 00:15:48,160
Is that the climax of the song?   -Yes

250
00:15:48,160 --> 00:15:49,960
So there's other parts too?

251
00:15:49,960 --> 00:15:50,750
Yes, of course

252
00:15:50,750 --> 00:15:53,300
It starts with "What did you do after a date?"

253
00:15:53,300 --> 00:15:56,050
"We went to a hot spring after a date"

254
00:15:56,050 --> 00:15:58,490
"What did you do after going to a hot spring?"

255
00:15:58,490 --> 00:16:01,030
"We went to a hotel after going to a hot spring"

256
00:16:01,030 --> 00:16:03,410
"What did you do after going to a hotel?"

257
00:16:03,410 --> 00:16:05,980
"We drank sake after going to a hotel"

258
00:16:05,980 --> 00:16:08,460
"What did you do after drinking sake?"

259
00:16:08,460 --> 00:16:11,080
"Yes, of course we had sex"

260
00:16:11,080 --> 00:16:15,540
"Date first then have sex, or have sex first then date"

261
00:16:15,540 --> 00:16:17,440
This is the song of order

262
00:16:19,260 --> 00:16:20,880
What is the message of the song?

263
00:16:20,880 --> 00:16:26,950
Well, I'm really curious, do people have date first then have sex, or the other way round?

264
00:16:26,950 --> 00:16:29,770
Oh, well, both can be true, it depends

265
00:16:29,950 --> 00:16:32,540
That's why I made a song about it

266
00:16:34,550 --> 00:16:38,610
Like do people wear jeans first then wear shirts, or wear shirts first then wear jeans

267
00:16:39,160 --> 00:16:41,710
Is there a version about wearing clothes?   -Yes, of course

268
00:16:41,710 --> 00:16:42,980
Wearing clothes?

269
00:16:43,160 --> 00:16:45,780
So all about wearing clothes?   -Like jeans and shirts?

270
00:16:45,780 --> 00:16:49,000
"Wear jeans first then wear shirts, or wear shirts first then wear jeans"

271
00:16:49,000 --> 00:16:50,600
"Wear jeans first then wear shirts"

272
00:16:50,600 --> 00:16:52,330
"Wear shirts first then wear jeans"

273
00:16:52,330 --> 00:16:54,120
"Wear jeans first then wear shirts"

274
00:16:54,120 --> 00:16:56,460
"Or wear shirts first then wear jeans"

275
00:16:56,460 --> 00:16:58,980
"Wear jeans first then wear shirts"

276
00:16:58,980 --> 00:17:02,020
"Nope, wear shirts first then wear jeans"

277
00:17:02,020 --> 00:17:03,400
He has a powerful voice

278
00:17:03,400 --> 00:17:04,680
I see

279
00:17:04,680 --> 00:17:06,650
What do you guys do?

280
00:17:07,700 --> 00:17:10,980
Well, we are comedians

281
00:17:11,330 --> 00:17:14,570
I aimed to be a comedian before too

282
00:17:14,570 --> 00:17:17,160
Eh? You aimed to be a comedian?

283
00:17:17,160 --> 00:17:19,360
Did you aim to be a comedian first, then became a musician?

284
00:17:19,360 --> 00:17:21,580
Or did you became a musician first, then aimed to be a comedian?

285
00:17:21,580 --> 00:17:24,300
"Aimed to be a comedian first, then became a musician"

286
00:17:24,300 --> 00:17:26,820
"After becoming a musician, of course we had sex"

287
00:17:27,660 --> 00:17:29,370
Had sex?

288
00:17:29,370 --> 00:17:30,780
Yes, I really love it

289
00:17:30,780 --> 00:17:32,180
Having sex?   -Yes

290
00:17:32,180 --> 00:17:34,880
Do you write music first, then write lyrics?

291
00:17:34,880 --> 00:17:37,840
Or do you write lyrics first, then write music?

292
00:17:37,840 --> 00:17:40,290
"What do you do after writing lyrics?"

293
00:17:40,290 --> 00:17:42,710
"Of course we write music"

294
00:17:42,710 --> 00:17:45,430
"What do you do after writing music?"

295
00:17:45,430 --> 00:17:47,680
"Of course we do recording"

296
00:17:47,680 --> 00:17:50,420
"What do you do after recording?"

297
00:17:50,420 --> 00:17:53,510
"Yes, of course we have sex!!!"

298
00:17:55,300 --> 00:17:57,380
He really likes it, he likes sex

299
00:17:57,380 --> 00:17:59,990
Come on, please leave

300
00:18:02,860 --> 00:18:04,470
Please leave

301
00:18:04,680 --> 00:18:07,670
Hey! Someone, please!

302
00:18:07,670 --> 00:18:09,030
Hey!

303
00:18:09,030 --> 00:18:11,110
Someone, please!

304
00:18:13,430 --> 00:18:14,670
Hey, someone please

305
00:18:14,670 --> 00:18:16,100
Hey, someone please?

306
00:18:16,100 --> 00:18:21,250
Does anyone have a PSP charger?

307
00:18:21,250 --> 00:18:23,000
What did you say?

308
00:18:23,000 --> 00:18:26,160
Does anyone have a...

309
00:18:26,160 --> 00:18:27,440
...PSP charger?

310
00:18:27,440 --> 00:18:29,260
No, we don't

311
00:18:29,870 --> 00:18:31,110
Oh jeez

312
00:18:31,110 --> 00:18:32,880
What game are you playing?

313
00:18:32,880 --> 00:18:34,200
Are you talking to me?

314
00:18:34,200 --> 00:18:37,730
I have been playing Tetris

315
00:18:37,730 --> 00:18:39,650
Tetris?

316
00:18:39,650 --> 00:18:43,440
We, the Takarazuka Revue, is doing a theater performance nearby

317
00:18:39,650 --> 00:18:50,380
*The Takarazuka Revue is a Japanese all-female musical theater troupe. Women play all roles in lavish, Broadway-style productions of Western-style musicals.

318
00:18:43,440 --> 00:18:47,490
And I planned to play games during my spare time

319
00:18:47,490 --> 00:18:49,350
You're from Takarazuka?   -Are you a women?

320
00:18:49,350 --> 00:18:50,380
Are you a women?

321
00:18:50,380 --> 00:18:52,810
I'm sorry for being remiss in not introducing myself

322
00:18:52,810 --> 00:18:56,890
I'm Osuda Kaoru from the Takarazuka Revue

323
00:18:56,890 --> 00:18:57,900
Osuda Kaoru?

324
00:18:57,900 --> 00:19:00,390
Please call me Osukaoru for short

325
00:19:02,920 --> 00:19:04,600
You're a women?

326
00:19:04,600 --> 00:19:06,710
Which troupe do you belong to?

327
00:19:04,600 --> 00:19:14,040
*Takarazuka Revue is divided into 5 troupes: Flower, Moon, Snow, Star, Cosmos

328
00:19:06,710 --> 00:19:07,610
The North Troupe

329
00:19:07,610 --> 00:19:09,070
The North Troupe?

330
00:19:09,070 --> 00:19:12,040
Not the Flower Troupe or the Moon Troupe?

331
00:19:12,040 --> 00:19:14,040
Yes, we're divided into the East, South, West, North troupes

332
00:19:14,040 --> 00:19:15,630
Our...   -Our?

333
00:19:15,630 --> 00:19:16,940
Daga...Taka...Takarazu...

334
00:19:16,940 --> 00:19:18,200
Daga?

335
00:19:18,200 --> 00:19:21,790
That's how our Takarazuka Revue works

336
00:19:21,790 --> 00:19:23,600
Does anyone have a PSP charger?

337
00:19:23,600 --> 00:19:26,760
Nope, we don't

338
00:19:26,760 --> 00:19:27,920
How could this happen to me?

339
00:19:27,920 --> 00:19:31,260
How should I spend my spare time then?

340
00:19:31,260 --> 00:19:32,360
Fine

341
00:19:32,360 --> 00:19:33,680
If this is how it's gonna be

342
00:19:33,680 --> 00:19:36,930
I'll just have to dance happily and cheerfully

343
00:19:36,930 --> 00:19:38,420
Shall we dance?

344
00:19:38,420 --> 00:19:40,130
Eh?   -He's inviting you

345
00:19:40,130 --> 00:19:42,180
No way, I know nothing about Takarazuka

346
00:19:42,180 --> 00:19:44,790
No worries, I will lead you through   -Let him lead you

347
00:19:44,790 --> 00:19:45,940
By the way, did you ever dance?

348
00:19:45,940 --> 00:19:47,340
No, not at all

349
00:19:47,340 --> 00:19:50,550
Then just let me...

350
00:19:50,550 --> 00:19:51,120
Please stand up...

351
00:19:51,120 --> 00:19:53,320
Eh? Let you what?   -Please stand up

352
00:19:53,320 --> 00:19:54,710
Let me lead you through

353
00:19:54,710 --> 00:19:57,840
I'm really worried

354
00:20:01,170 --> 00:20:07,790
"The brightness of hope and dreams"

355
00:20:07,990 --> 00:20:15,640
"We all have our dreams"

356
00:20:15,640 --> 00:20:21,090
But what should you do when you feel frustrated and overwhelmed?

357
00:20:21,090 --> 00:20:21,640
I will...

358
00:20:21,640 --> 00:20:32,140
"It will soon become our memory"

359
00:20:32,140 --> 00:20:37,060
"So when you are feeling sad and frustrated"

360
00:20:37,060 --> 00:20:43,660
"We shall face forward and..."

361
00:20:43,660 --> 00:20:52,570
"Move forward"

362
00:20:59,920 --> 00:21:04,110
Finally, I managed to kill the time

363
00:21:04,110 --> 00:21:07,440
I am really thankful to you   -No problem

364
00:21:07,440 --> 00:21:11,490
If anyone found my PSP charger

365
00:21:11,490 --> 00:21:13,750
Please let me know at the venue nearby

366
00:21:13,750 --> 00:21:15,980
*The Takarazuka Revue only performs in their own Takarazuka Theater

367
00:21:13,750 --> 00:21:15,980
Venue?

368
00:21:15,980 --> 00:21:19,000
We are doing performances at other places now

369
00:21:19,000 --> 00:21:20,780
It's called the "Weekend Takarazuka"

370
00:21:20,780 --> 00:21:22,760
*Yoshimoto holds Owarai live performances "Weekend Yoshimoto" at many difference places

371
00:21:20,780 --> 00:21:22,760
Something like the "Weekend Yoshimoto?

372
00:21:22,760 --> 00:21:25,540
I've never heard of that, but ours is called the "Weekend Takarazuka"

373
00:21:25,540 --> 00:21:28,220
Yoshimoto has performances called "Weekend Yoshimoto" too

374
00:21:28,220 --> 00:21:30,150
We, Takarazuka, has the same thing too

375
00:21:30,150 --> 00:21:32,370
So please come and watch our performance

376
00:21:32,550 --> 00:21:34,520
Thank you for your time

377
00:21:40,180 --> 00:21:42,040
He attacked aggressively, huh?

378
00:21:42,040 --> 00:21:43,570
Yeah, he attacked aggressively

379
00:21:43,570 --> 00:21:48,280
Akiyama, take a look at this

380
00:21:48,280 --> 00:21:49,830
What is this?

381
00:21:49,830 --> 00:21:51,300
I borrowed this from someone

382
00:21:51,300 --> 00:21:53,660
Someone we know?

383
00:21:53,660 --> 00:21:55,660
Flip it over, right?

384
00:22:04,110 --> 00:22:07,570
*Gold is the highest rank of Japan's driver's license, only given to drivers who didn't break any driving rules for 5 years

385
00:22:04,110 --> 00:22:07,570
*However, the owner of this license, Tsutsumishita Atsushi, was found by a police officer to be in a groggy state in the driver's seat of a car after having taken sleeping pills, and was put on suspension by Yoshimoto

386
00:22:04,110 --> 00:22:07,570
A Gold driver's license   -Why the heck is this dude Gold?***

387
00:22:08,460 --> 00:22:12,380
Even this dude is Gold, come on

388
00:22:13,690 --> 00:22:16,780
He's a Gold driver?   -Yes, he's Gold

389
00:22:16,780 --> 00:22:20,350
You borrowed this from him?   -Yes

390
00:22:22,570 --> 00:22:25,030
He changed his LINE icon recently

391
00:22:25,770 --> 00:22:27,170
Oh, really?   -Yes, he changed it

392
00:22:27,170 --> 00:22:27,730
To what?

393
00:22:27,730 --> 00:22:29,370
He changed it to Peepo-kun*

394
00:22:27,730 --> 00:22:31,990
*Peepo-kun is the mascot of the Toyko Metropolitan Police Department

395
00:22:30,350 --> 00:22:31,990
The police mascot?   -Yes

396
00:22:31,990 --> 00:22:34,070
That's provocative   -Unbelievable

397
00:22:34,070 --> 00:22:36,400
Only Eikoh-chan is not from Yoshimoto, right?

398
00:22:36,400 --> 00:22:38,000
Well, yes

399
00:22:38,000 --> 00:22:40,830
You wanna take a look at Yoshimoto's wage slip?

400
00:22:40,830 --> 00:22:42,140
Eh?

401
00:22:42,140 --> 00:22:43,600
Who's wage slip?

402
00:22:43,600 --> 00:22:45,400
This is for real   -Is this the real one?

403
00:22:45,400 --> 00:22:47,420
Yes, it's the real one

404
00:22:48,020 --> 00:22:49,560
I wonder who's wage slip is it?

405
00:22:49,560 --> 00:22:50,700
Is this fine? I feel guilty

406
00:22:50,700 --> 00:22:51,650
For January

407
00:22:51,650 --> 00:22:53,650
Who's is it?

408
00:22:54,580 --> 00:22:57,580
You don't always get to see other's wage slip

409
00:22:57,580 --> 00:22:59,000
Should I hide it first?

410
00:22:59,000 --> 00:23:01,810
Oh, it's Tsutsumishita Atsushi

411
00:23:01,810 --> 00:23:05,160
Which month?   -January

412
00:23:05,160 --> 00:23:06,660
It's really long

413
00:23:06,660 --> 00:23:09,270
Look at his wage

414
00:23:10,980 --> 00:23:13,320
Minus 5,400 yen

415
00:23:13,320 --> 00:23:15,920
The cost of finding other comedians to replace him

416
00:23:15,920 --> 00:23:16,870
What is this?

417
00:23:16,870 --> 00:23:20,900
Look at how much he earned for appearing in Ametalk DVD6, 25 yen

418
00:23:20,900 --> 00:23:22,580
What did he do at all?

419
00:23:22,660 --> 00:23:24,480
Because he's suspended, so...   -Exactly

420
00:23:24,480 --> 00:23:28,040
So all he can earn is from those DVDs   -Yes, exactly

421
00:23:28,040 --> 00:23:30,550
Lincoln Comedian Sports Day

422
00:23:30,550 --> 00:23:32,590
1 yen   -1 yen?

423
00:23:33,570 --> 00:23:37,070
How can you even transfer that money?

424
00:23:37,070 --> 00:23:39,420
So how much did he earn in total?

425
00:23:41,850 --> 00:23:45,200
9,513 yen

426
00:23:45,200 --> 00:23:47,760
This dude is earning a lot, huh? Tsutsumishita

427
00:23:47,760 --> 00:23:49,110
Yeah, he's earning so much

428
00:23:49,110 --> 00:23:51,590
Given the fact that he didn't work at all

429
00:23:51,590 --> 00:23:53,880
How much did you earn when you were suspended, Eikoh-chan?

430
00:23:53,880 --> 00:23:55,790
Zero   -Oh, zero?

431
00:23:55,790 --> 00:23:58,890
All I earned was from those DVDs too...

432
00:23:58,890 --> 00:24:03,490
So, let's go for the zombies

433
00:24:03,630 --> 00:24:07,790
Zombie time

434
00:24:08,030 --> 00:24:11,160
This scared me

435
00:24:11,160 --> 00:24:12,220
We have to endure this

436
00:24:12,220 --> 00:24:14,620
It's Jimmy-san, right?

437
00:24:14,620 --> 00:24:17,070
Jimmy-san and Tamura, that's awful

438
00:24:20,940 --> 00:24:25,680
He looks exactly the same as before

439
00:24:26,070 --> 00:24:27,570
Many hours have passed already...

440
00:24:27,570 --> 00:24:30,590
And he still looks exactly the same, nothing changed at all

441
00:24:34,610 --> 00:24:37,860
World cup

442
00:24:47,930 --> 00:24:49,980
Please give me a moment...

443
00:24:49,980 --> 00:24:53,310
Just give me a moment...

444
00:25:04,440 --> 00:25:06,950
Singapore*

445
00:25:04,440 --> 00:25:12,660
*Singapore can also be interpreted as "a hidden pole (芯がポール)"

446
00:25:06,950 --> 00:25:08,990
Singapore is written on it too

447
00:25:08,990 --> 00:25:10,450
Oh, so you mean a hidden pole?

448
00:25:10,450 --> 00:25:12,660
Singapore

449
00:25:14,080 --> 00:25:15,260
Ouch, ouch, ouch

450
00:25:16,630 --> 00:25:17,910
Raw?

451
00:25:17,910 --> 00:25:19,570
Yeah, it's raw...

452
00:25:19,570 --> 00:25:22,040
Ouch, ouch, ouch

453
00:25:22,040 --> 00:25:23,900
I said it hurts

454
00:25:26,120 --> 00:25:27,340
Where did you buy this thing?

455
00:25:27,340 --> 00:25:29,150
Eh?   -Where did you buy this thing?

456
00:25:29,150 --> 00:25:31,900
Online sales

457
00:25:31,900 --> 00:25:34,060
1,980 yen after discounts

458
00:25:36,100 --> 00:25:37,270
Is that how it is?

459
00:25:37,270 --> 00:25:39,230
Eh?   -Is that how it is?

460
00:25:39,230 --> 00:25:40,970
You didn't do anything to it?   -Eh?

461
00:25:40,970 --> 00:25:42,320
You didn't do anything to it?

462
00:25:42,320 --> 00:25:43,700
No, I didn't, that's how it is

463
00:25:43,700 --> 00:25:45,020
You can buy this thing?   -Eh?

464
00:25:45,020 --> 00:25:48,260
He never understands the questions at the first time

465
00:25:48,660 --> 00:25:53,260
But if you lift it's chin, your pole can come out smoothly

466
00:25:53,260 --> 00:25:55,800
My Singapore

467
00:25:55,800 --> 00:25:57,830
Is it fastened?

468
00:25:57,830 --> 00:26:01,510
Yes, it's fastened, my Singapore

469
00:26:03,320 --> 00:26:06,050
Actually...I...today...

470
00:26:06,460 --> 00:26:08,490
Ouch!

471
00:26:08,490 --> 00:26:09,430
On the Shinkansen...

472
00:26:09,430 --> 00:26:10,520
Ouch, ouch, ouch

473
00:26:10,520 --> 00:26:13,820
Hey dude, don't flip my skirt up, it hurts

474
00:26:13,820 --> 00:26:15,330
It really hurts

475
00:26:15,330 --> 00:26:18,670
When I was on the Shinkansen today...ouch...

476
00:26:18,670 --> 00:26:19,890
Can I just take this off?

477
00:26:19,890 --> 00:26:20,990
Nope, you can't

478
00:26:20,990 --> 00:26:22,360
But it hurts

479
00:26:22,360 --> 00:26:25,510
Wait...ouch, ouch...

480
00:26:25,510 --> 00:26:28,120
The tip of my toe is...   -The tip of your toe?

481
00:26:28,120 --> 00:26:29,890
No, not the tip of my toe

482
00:26:29,890 --> 00:26:32,500
The tip of your toe?

483
00:26:32,500 --> 00:26:33,400
It hurts?

484
00:26:33,400 --> 00:26:35,500
Not the tip of my toe

485
00:26:35,500 --> 00:26:39,110
The tip...the tip...the tip of my penis

486
00:26:39,110 --> 00:26:40,880
The tip of my penis

487
00:26:40,880 --> 00:26:43,340
It feels like it's pinched by a zipper

488
00:26:43,340 --> 00:26:45,340
That must be painful   -Yes, it hurts so bad

489
00:26:45,340 --> 00:26:46,640
Are you having an erection now?

490
00:26:46,640 --> 00:26:48,160
No I'm not, no

491
00:26:48,160 --> 00:26:51,090
It's just pinched, so it's really painful

492
00:26:51,500 --> 00:26:52,980
Ouch, ouch, ouch

493
00:26:52,980 --> 00:26:54,020
There's nothing we can do though

494
00:26:54,020 --> 00:26:56,880
Because I have phimosis

495
00:26:56,880 --> 00:26:58,970
Coming out all of a sudden

496
00:26:59,230 --> 00:27:00,940
But there's nothing we can do though...

497
00:27:00,940 --> 00:27:03,270
Well, it doesn't matter

498
00:27:03,270 --> 00:27:06,950
It doesn't matter?   -Yeah, it doesn't matter

499
00:27:08,300 --> 00:27:15,000
When I was on the Shinkansen today

500
00:27:15,000 --> 00:27:20,390
My hands got pinched by the door

501
00:27:20,390 --> 00:27:23,960
And they're congested now

502
00:27:23,960 --> 00:27:26,260
Not only my hands though   -Not only your hands?

503
00:27:26,700 --> 00:27:28,190
My feet too

504
00:27:28,190 --> 00:27:29,270
You feet are congested too?

505
00:27:29,270 --> 00:27:30,230
My feet got pinched too

506
00:27:30,230 --> 00:27:32,350
How did that happen?

507
00:27:32,350 --> 00:27:34,620
That's just impossible

508
00:27:34,620 --> 00:27:37,440
I got pinched like this

509
00:27:37,440 --> 00:27:39,880
No way, that's impossible

510
00:27:39,880 --> 00:27:43,240
Both my hands and feet got pinched like this

511
00:27:43,240 --> 00:27:45,240
That's why they're red?

512
00:27:45,240 --> 00:27:47,150
Wait a second, wait a second...

513
00:27:47,150 --> 00:27:48,710
-It's so round   -Wait, wait, wait a second...

514
00:27:48,710 --> 00:27:51,600
Stop, stop, wait a second...

515
00:27:51,600 --> 00:27:53,680
They're congested

516
00:27:53,680 --> 00:27:55,660
His balls are so round

517
00:27:55,660 --> 00:27:57,330
You have bunions, huh?

518
00:27:57,330 --> 00:27:59,550
Eh?

519
00:27:59,550 --> 00:28:01,350
It's fine for you to laugh, Jimmy-san

520
00:28:01,350 --> 00:28:03,640
You can laugh, Jimmy-san

521
00:28:03,640 --> 00:28:04,400
Oh, really?

522
00:28:04,400 --> 00:28:06,350
You're a zombie, so it's fine

523
00:28:06,350 --> 00:28:07,740
Oh yeah, I'm a zombie so it's fine...

524
00:28:07,740 --> 00:28:08,780
Sorry for this

525
00:28:10,480 --> 00:28:11,840
Let's play Russian Roulette

526
00:28:12,400 --> 00:28:14,980
Scary, scary, God knows what's inside that gun

527
00:28:14,980 --> 00:28:16,780
Shall I go first then?

528
00:28:17,430 --> 00:28:20,180
I'll go first, so...

529
00:28:20,180 --> 00:28:22,250
Pass this around and take your turn

530
00:28:22,250 --> 00:28:24,820
Scary, scary, what happens if the pistol is loaded?

531
00:28:24,820 --> 00:28:27,220
Well, you'll probably die

532
00:28:27,220 --> 00:28:30,490
Eh? Die? For real?

533
00:28:30,490 --> 00:28:32,440
How many bullets are there?   -I don't wanna die

534
00:28:32,440 --> 00:28:35,540
Why can't you understand it at the first time?   -12 rounds

535
00:28:35,540 --> 00:28:37,640
No way, that's impossible

536
00:28:37,640 --> 00:28:39,550
Isn't it 6 rounds?   -Yes, 6 rounds

537
00:28:39,550 --> 00:28:41,260
So one in six shots

538
00:28:41,260 --> 00:28:42,920
Will fire?   -Will fire

539
00:28:42,920 --> 00:28:44,010
It's gonna sound like "Bang"?

540
00:28:44,010 --> 00:28:44,490
Eh?

541
00:28:44,490 --> 00:28:45,720
It's gonna sound like "Bang"?

542
00:28:45,720 --> 00:28:47,410
How else could it sound like?

543
00:28:48,050 --> 00:28:49,820
Will something come out?

544
00:28:49,820 --> 00:28:50,220
Eh?

545
00:28:50,220 --> 00:28:51,900
Excuse me, will something come out?

546
00:28:51,900 --> 00:28:53,990
Stop asking others to repeat themselves

547
00:28:53,990 --> 00:28:54,600
Eh?

548
00:28:54,600 --> 00:28:56,680
Bang, just Bang

549
00:28:56,680 --> 00:28:58,680
What's that cap for?

550
00:28:58,680 --> 00:29:02,450
This is just for firefighting   -Firefighting?

551
00:29:02,450 --> 00:29:05,360
Anyway, I'll go first

552
00:29:05,360 --> 00:29:06,690
I'll go for it

553
00:29:09,260 --> 00:29:10,060
So it's me

554
00:29:15,070 --> 00:29:17,090
Better heal your bunions

555
00:29:18,980 --> 00:29:21,310
I told you it's fine to laugh

556
00:29:28,450 --> 00:29:30,720
That was so close

557
00:29:30,720 --> 00:29:33,150
Singapore almost got me

558
00:29:33,150 --> 00:29:36,280
How he tries to hold back his laughter is funny too

559
00:29:36,280 --> 00:29:38,160
It's funny that he didn't get changed too

560
00:29:39,150 --> 00:29:40,630
What's that for, Zakoshi?

561
00:29:40,630 --> 00:29:41,790
I just wanna take a bath

562
00:29:41,790 --> 00:29:42,580
Eh?

563
00:29:42,580 --> 00:29:43,290
Bath

564
00:29:43,830 --> 00:29:47,090
-Quite difficult to adjust the temperature though
-Both of you are taking a bath

565
00:29:47,090 --> 00:29:49,680
You're gonna take a bath?   -Yes, I want a bath

566
00:29:51,060 --> 00:29:54,560
It's so hot! So difficult to adjust the temperature

567
00:29:57,870 --> 00:29:59,420
Oh, it's just right now

568
00:29:59,870 --> 00:30:02,450
Is this gonna work?

569
00:30:02,450 --> 00:30:04,420
I just really wanna take a bath

570
00:30:09,420 --> 00:30:10,450
Is this fine?

571
00:30:10,450 --> 00:30:12,860
Will it break?   -I told you it's impossible

572
00:30:12,860 --> 00:30:14,940
It should be fine

573
00:30:17,700 --> 00:30:19,430
It's just impossible to take a bath with that

574
00:30:19,430 --> 00:30:21,340
Of course I can   -The size is different

575
00:30:21,340 --> 00:30:22,720
Is it safe to do it on the table?

576
00:30:22,720 --> 00:30:24,610
Maybe this will break?

577
00:30:24,610 --> 00:30:26,040
Better just do it on the floor

578
00:30:31,140 --> 00:30:33,320
What the heck are you doing, Akiyama?

579
00:30:33,320 --> 00:30:36,810
He's taking a bath for real

580
00:30:36,810 --> 00:30:38,650
He's having a perfect bath

581
00:30:59,690 --> 00:31:00,570
How is it?

582
00:31:00,570 --> 00:31:02,990
The temperature is just right

583
00:31:02,990 --> 00:31:03,900
Oh, I see

584
00:31:04,960 --> 00:31:07,460
They are taking a bath in different styles

585
00:31:07,460 --> 00:31:09,680
Oh, maybe it's a bit too hot   -Too hot?

586
00:31:09,680 --> 00:31:12,420
Let Akiyama take a bath with that too

587
00:31:12,420 --> 00:31:14,950
Is Akiyama taking a bath with cold water?

588
00:31:14,950 --> 00:31:16,950
May I?   -Yes, sure

589
00:31:17,800 --> 00:31:19,330
Ah, it's a bit too hot

590
00:31:19,330 --> 00:31:20,880
Yeah, it's a bit too hot

591
00:31:20,880 --> 00:31:23,970
I think it should be just right now

592
00:31:27,470 --> 00:31:29,600
Can you please let me try it again?   -Yeah, sure

593
00:31:29,600 --> 00:31:31,290
Excuse me

594
00:31:33,020 --> 00:31:35,170
The temperature should be just right now

595
00:31:36,160 --> 00:31:38,450
Ah, so warm

596
00:31:38,450 --> 00:31:41,250
Maybe a bit too hot   -A bit too hot?

597
00:31:41,710 --> 00:31:44,650
Is this how you take a bath?

598
00:31:44,650 --> 00:31:46,790
That's pretty unique

599
00:31:46,790 --> 00:31:49,440
This is how you should wash your penis

600
00:31:49,440 --> 00:31:51,930
You have to soak the root of your penis in hot water as well

601
00:31:51,930 --> 00:31:54,360
Or else you could catch a cold   -Catch a cold?

602
00:31:54,360 --> 00:31:56,900
I remember Gauguin did a painting about this

603
00:31:57,380 --> 00:31:58,650
That's quite rare

604
00:31:58,650 --> 00:32:01,100
Can you fit it all in?

605
00:32:01,100 --> 00:32:02,260
You can?!

606
00:32:02,260 --> 00:32:03,890
Just with that?

607
00:32:05,040 --> 00:32:07,690
Oh, he's done

608
00:32:07,690 --> 00:32:10,050
*After coming out from a hot onsen, people usually use a cold water bath to cool down

609
00:32:07,690 --> 00:32:10,050
So he's taking a cold bath now*

610
00:32:14,420 --> 00:32:17,380
Ah, this feels so good

611
00:32:20,970 --> 00:32:22,420
Thank you very much

612
00:32:22,420 --> 00:32:24,920
Maybe it's time to let out Tamuken zombie?

613
00:32:24,920 --> 00:32:26,460
Okay, let's go for it

614
00:32:27,560 --> 00:32:30,590
Zombie time

615
00:32:31,990 --> 00:32:34,390
This really scared me

616
00:32:37,260 --> 00:32:38,580
It looks so much fun, huh?

617
00:32:38,580 --> 00:32:40,760
Yeah, it looks really fun

618
00:32:40,760 --> 00:32:41,970
Oh, really?   -Yeah

619
00:32:41,970 --> 00:32:43,970
I was actually quite confident with that too

620
00:32:43,970 --> 00:32:45,150
I really like that one

621
00:32:45,150 --> 00:32:48,020
It's really popular in Osaka

622
00:32:48,020 --> 00:32:49,800
*"Heh" means fart in Japanese, so combined with Harmonica, the game is called "Heh-monica"

623
00:32:48,020 --> 00:32:49,800
Heh-monica*

624
00:32:49,800 --> 00:32:52,810
Hey everybody, Jimmy wants to play Heh-monica

625
00:32:52,810 --> 00:32:54,810
So please stand over there

626
00:32:54,810 --> 00:32:56,280
Eh? Again?

627
00:32:56,280 --> 00:33:00,060
If you hear him letting it out, remember to let us know

628
00:33:00,060 --> 00:33:01,710
Huh? Let what out?

629
00:33:01,710 --> 00:33:03,380
The sound of the Harmonica

630
00:33:03,380 --> 00:33:06,280
You lose if you let out any sound, that's Heh-monica

631
00:33:06,280 --> 00:33:09,310
Okay, so Jimmy is playing this

632
00:33:09,310 --> 00:33:10,880
We can clearly see it

633
00:33:10,880 --> 00:33:11,370
What?

634
00:33:11,370 --> 00:33:13,880
He's still wearing his Singapore

635
00:33:13,880 --> 00:33:14,840
Are you wearing it?

636
00:33:14,840 --> 00:33:16,330
Nope, I'm not   -You're definitely wearing it

637
00:33:16,330 --> 00:33:18,180
We can clearly see it

638
00:33:24,540 --> 00:33:26,820
What are you laughing at?

639
00:33:26,820 --> 00:33:28,190
Better just hold it

640
00:33:28,190 --> 00:33:29,530
Are you ready?

641
00:33:29,530 --> 00:33:31,630
Remember not to let out any sound

642
00:33:31,630 --> 00:33:33,660
I'm going do it now, are you ready?

643
00:33:49,870 --> 00:33:51,280
Oh, where did it go?

644
00:33:51,280 --> 00:33:53,230
It's broken

645
00:33:54,290 --> 00:33:56,180
My Singapore too...

646
00:33:58,480 --> 00:34:00,220
It's sticking out!

647
00:34:01,350 --> 00:34:04,620
Singapore is sticking out

648
00:34:07,970 --> 00:34:09,600
These things could happen, huh?

649
00:34:16,160 --> 00:34:17,570
La

650
00:34:17,570 --> 00:34:18,750
La?

651
00:34:18,750 --> 00:34:20,330
He has perfect pitch

652
00:34:20,330 --> 00:34:21,340
Was that La though?

653
00:34:24,860 --> 00:34:25,390
La

654
00:34:28,670 --> 00:34:31,350
The pitch was different from the first one, dude

655
00:34:35,660 --> 00:34:36,350
La

656
00:34:41,290 --> 00:34:43,040
Give me a Mi now, Mi

657
00:34:43,040 --> 00:34:44,690
Mi?   -Give me a Mi

658
00:34:46,570 --> 00:34:47,280
What is it?

659
00:34:48,320 --> 00:34:48,830
Mi

660
00:34:48,830 --> 00:34:50,130
Say La, dude!

661
00:34:51,720 --> 00:34:53,380
You should say La here, dude!

662
00:34:54,140 --> 00:34:55,480
Don't say Mi

663
00:34:55,480 --> 00:34:57,710
Even if it's Mi, just say La

664
00:34:57,710 --> 00:34:59,710
We'll be back

665
00:35:01,120 --> 00:35:03,490
We've been alone for so long

666
00:35:03,980 --> 00:35:05,070
Ouch!

667
00:35:14,220 --> 00:35:16,300
Oh my god! That was close!

668
00:35:16,300 --> 00:35:18,300
That almost got me!

669
00:35:20,590 --> 00:35:22,170
That was so close!

670
00:35:22,400 --> 00:35:28,010
I feel like that's the origin of Owarai

671
00:35:28,340 --> 00:35:31,180
We tried really hard   -I'm sure you guys did

672
00:35:31,180 --> 00:35:33,780
I think two people laughed

673
00:35:33,780 --> 00:35:34,450
Eh? Who?

674
00:35:34,450 --> 00:35:36,350
Probably Takahashi and Jinnai

675
00:35:36,350 --> 00:35:37,370
Eh?

676
00:35:37,550 --> 00:35:39,450
No, Takahashi definitely laughed

677
00:35:39,450 --> 00:35:41,190
But I endured it

678
00:35:41,190 --> 00:35:41,920
Let's take a look

679
00:35:43,170 --> 00:35:44,460
We've been alone for so long

680
00:35:45,970 --> 00:35:47,590
Ouch!

681
00:35:50,110 --> 00:35:53,360
That's just the same kind of face that Junior did before

682
00:35:53,360 --> 00:35:55,310
You laughed out loud at that one

683
00:35:55,310 --> 00:35:56,200
Yes, he did, he did

684
00:35:56,200 --> 00:35:59,100
Both of you are out

685
00:35:59,280 --> 00:36:01,170
Hooray!

686
00:36:01,170 --> 00:36:02,710
Both of them?   -This is a big turning point

687
00:36:02,710 --> 00:36:04,080
Yeah, this is a big turning point

688
00:36:09,080 --> 00:36:11,500
Everyone is nearly out now

689
00:36:11,500 --> 00:36:12,500
Except Zakoshi

690
00:36:12,500 --> 00:36:13,860
Yeah this dude, Zakoshi...

691
00:36:13,860 --> 00:36:15,240
He's zero, right?

692
00:36:15,240 --> 00:36:17,010
Yes, zero

693
00:36:17,010 --> 00:36:17,560
What the heck?

694
00:36:17,560 --> 00:36:21,780
But Zakoshi has been attacking aggressively too

695
00:36:21,780 --> 00:36:24,200
So no complaints to make, honestly

696
00:36:24,200 --> 00:36:26,740
Yeah, if I didn't attack, then...   -Then, yeah

697
00:36:27,120 --> 00:36:28,110
Anyway

698
00:36:28,800 --> 00:36:30,470
We're leaving   -Good work guys

699
00:36:30,900 --> 00:36:33,920
How should I put it?

700
00:36:33,920 --> 00:36:36,540
That place is magical, honestly

701
00:36:36,540 --> 00:36:39,060
"What did you do after drinking sake?"

702
00:36:39,060 --> 00:36:41,690
"Yes, of course we had sex"

703
00:36:41,690 --> 00:36:46,640
"Date first then have sex, or have sex first then date"

704
00:36:46,640 --> 00:36:51,760
That place is a lot more magical than I expected

705
00:36:51,960 --> 00:36:56,280
Arghh...I just feel...umm...

706
00:36:56,280 --> 00:36:57,700
I feel frustrated

707
00:36:57,700 --> 00:37:00,400
Well...arghh...

708
00:37:00,400 --> 00:37:02,330
Yeah...

709
00:37:02,330 --> 00:37:04,550
Jimmy-san is just too much

710
00:37:05,140 --> 00:37:06,210
Ouch!

711
00:37:08,300 --> 00:37:09,780
I have no choice but to laugh

712
00:37:09,780 --> 00:37:14,000
I know I will be out at some point, but...arghh

713
00:37:14,000 --> 00:37:15,980
Pheww...

714
00:37:15,980 --> 00:37:17,740
That was incredible

715
00:37:17,740 --> 00:37:21,720
That was incredible, but I wonder what will happen next

716
00:37:21,720 --> 00:37:23,250
Let's start

717
00:37:25,880 --> 00:37:30,430
Zakoshi can you sit on the sofa over there

718
00:37:30,430 --> 00:37:35,300
And imitate Kurisu Masanobu by yourself forever, since it never got a laugh

719
00:37:35,300 --> 00:37:36,910
Okay, sure

720
00:37:36,910 --> 00:37:39,320
Kurisu Masanobu, you got it?   -Yeah, no problem

721
00:37:39,320 --> 00:37:40,810
But Junior-san don't know him, right?

722
00:37:40,810 --> 00:37:42,360
He won't laugh even if he knows him anyway

723
00:37:42,360 --> 00:37:45,140
Kurisu Masa..?   -Masanobu

724
00:37:45,140 --> 00:37:46,640
Who is he?   -A professional wrestler

725
00:37:46,640 --> 00:37:47,550
A bald wrestler

726
00:37:47,550 --> 00:37:50,780
That imitation didn't even get a laugh from wrestling fans

727
00:37:50,780 --> 00:37:52,810
Just do it by yourself

728
00:37:56,950 --> 00:37:59,640
What are you doing, dude?

729
00:37:59,640 --> 00:38:02,580
Of course I have to give him the Final cut (wrestling move)

730
00:38:02,580 --> 00:38:04,580
What the heck are you doing?

731
00:38:07,480 --> 00:38:09,780
Just get out of my way

732
00:38:09,780 --> 00:38:12,010
I told you to get out of my away

733
00:38:12,010 --> 00:38:13,960
Get out!

734
00:38:13,960 --> 00:38:16,090
What are you doing, dude?

735
00:38:21,050 --> 00:38:22,280
What's this?

736
00:38:22,660 --> 00:38:24,590
What's this?

737
00:38:24,590 --> 00:38:26,590
What the heck is this?

738
00:38:26,590 --> 00:38:29,510
What are you doing, dude?

739
00:38:31,620 --> 00:38:34,990
I'm in a tag match now

740
00:38:35,690 --> 00:38:39,750
Of course I have to give him the Final cut (wrestling move)

741
00:38:39,750 --> 00:38:42,330
Get out of my way!

742
00:38:42,330 --> 00:38:44,970
I told you to get out of my way!

743
00:38:50,390 --> 00:38:53,690
What are you doing, dude?

744
00:38:53,690 --> 00:38:58,150
I told you I'm in a tag match!

745
00:38:59,160 --> 00:39:01,530
That scene was interesting

746
00:39:14,200 --> 00:39:16,300
This thing is amazing

747
00:39:19,000 --> 00:39:19,940
What the heck is this?

748
00:39:19,940 --> 00:39:21,910
This thing is amazing

749
00:39:22,580 --> 00:39:23,610
Superb

750
00:39:24,810 --> 00:39:26,180
That was superb

751
00:39:27,650 --> 00:39:29,420
Who's point is this though?

752
00:39:29,420 --> 00:39:36,850
The points go to Kanoh, who brought this toy, and Junior, who passed him the Harmonica

753
00:39:49,060 --> 00:39:51,890
Akiyama out!

754
00:39:51,890 --> 00:39:53,600
You worked really hard though

755
00:39:58,950 --> 00:40:01,130
So the last hour

756
00:40:01,840 --> 00:40:03,650
Only one more hour left?

757
00:40:03,650 --> 00:40:07,380
Zakoshi is so damn strong! He's even the nearest to that toy

758
00:40:07,380 --> 00:40:10,720
That scene was just...I couldn't avoid it

759
00:40:10,720 --> 00:40:12,720
I won't laugh if it's just the sound of a Harmonica

760
00:40:12,720 --> 00:40:16,390
But that monkey replied in the exact same pitch

761
00:40:18,070 --> 00:40:19,860
So I just have to give up and laugh

762
00:40:19,860 --> 00:40:24,840
There's actually still a lot of items in my bag

763
00:40:25,430 --> 00:40:29,010
And there's still plenty of time for me to make them laugh

764
00:40:29,010 --> 00:40:31,470
So I want to change my mood and try my best to make them laugh

765
00:40:35,650 --> 00:40:37,230
Let's start

766
00:40:39,370 --> 00:40:41,780
Zakoshi, this time...

767
00:40:41,780 --> 00:40:46,000
Do a imitation of Fuyuki Hiromichi over there, which never got a laugh on stage

768
00:40:46,000 --> 00:40:47,860
Fuyuki can definitely get a laugh

769
00:40:48,820 --> 00:40:50,920
Fuyuki Hiromichi?

770
00:40:51,870 --> 00:40:53,260
With Chono, right?   -Yes

771
00:40:53,260 --> 00:40:56,220
So Chono (wrestler) is over here

772
00:40:56,220 --> 00:41:00,560
And Fuyuki Hiromichi is a wrestler who is bad at speaking smoothly

773
00:41:00,560 --> 00:41:06,620
And he said "If I team up with Chono, no one can beat us, right?"

774
00:41:06,620 --> 00:41:08,620
But because he's bad at speaking smoothly, so he said it like this...

775
00:41:09,670 --> 00:41:12,880
If I team up with Chono, no one can beat us...right?

776
00:41:17,190 --> 00:41:20,820
If I team up with Chono, no one can beat us...right?

777
00:41:21,650 --> 00:41:23,780
So he's gonna do a imitation of this?

778
00:41:23,780 --> 00:41:25,460
He did it just now

779
00:41:25,460 --> 00:41:26,770
That's all

780
00:41:26,770 --> 00:41:27,990
I did it already

781
00:41:28,120 --> 00:41:29,670
Okay, let's go for it

782
00:41:31,390 --> 00:41:33,850
Zombie time

783
00:41:33,850 --> 00:41:34,990
This scared me

784
00:41:34,990 --> 00:41:36,600
So zombies again

785
00:41:38,320 --> 00:41:39,210
That was close

786
00:41:41,920 --> 00:41:44,220
He came back immediately as a zombie

787
00:41:47,090 --> 00:41:52,010
My body is feeling heavy recently

788
00:41:52,010 --> 00:41:54,760
So I started doing gymnastic formation to train my body

789
00:41:54,760 --> 00:41:59,800
And of course I'm not doing it alone, I'm doing it with ordinary people

790
00:41:59,800 --> 00:42:03,090
Well, you know, it's quite troublesome to go to gyms

791
00:42:03,090 --> 00:42:05,120
So I've invited someone today

792
00:42:05,120 --> 00:42:07,050
Excuse me, please come in

793
00:42:10,790 --> 00:42:11,950
Nice to meet you

794
00:42:11,950 --> 00:42:13,230
Nice to meet you too

795
00:42:13,230 --> 00:42:16,100
Thanks for coming   -Thanks for having me

796
00:42:16,100 --> 00:42:17,650
Do you know me?

797
00:42:17,650 --> 00:42:20,750
Yes, I'm a big fan of yours

798
00:42:20,750 --> 00:42:22,810
I've chosen you from many other applicants

799
00:42:22,810 --> 00:42:24,640
Thank you very much   -Let's work hard together

800
00:42:24,640 --> 00:42:27,230
Do you know what we'll be doing? Basically gymnastic formation

801
00:42:27,230 --> 00:42:28,700
Yes, that's all I know

802
00:42:28,700 --> 00:42:30,990
We'll be moving our bodies a lot   -Oh, I see

803
00:42:30,990 --> 00:42:32,990
So please come over here   -Okay

804
00:42:32,990 --> 00:42:34,110
Excuse me

805
00:42:35,350 --> 00:42:38,000
Let's choose the theme randomly from this box

806
00:42:38,000 --> 00:42:39,540
Sorry for being dumb...

807
00:42:41,270 --> 00:42:43,540
Thank you so much for coming today

808
00:42:49,620 --> 00:42:51,480
Asakusa? Is this Asakusa?

809
00:42:51,480 --> 00:42:53,550
Anyway, let's choose this one

810
00:42:55,290 --> 00:42:57,220
Oh, so Asakusa's Kaminarimon

811
00:42:57,870 --> 00:43:00,020
Asakusa's Kaminarimon

812
00:43:00,020 --> 00:43:02,020
How should we do this?

813
00:43:02,850 --> 00:43:04,300
How?

814
00:43:04,300 --> 00:43:06,460
It's gymnastic formation, so...

815
00:43:06,460 --> 00:43:07,570
How should we do this? So...

816
00:43:07,570 --> 00:43:10,790
Please spread your legs like this

817
00:43:10,790 --> 00:43:14,250
*Kaminarimon literally means "Thunder Gate"

818
00:43:10,790 --> 00:43:14,250
Spread your legs wider, this will be the gate*

819
00:43:14,250 --> 00:43:16,310
There're many tourists here, so...

820
00:43:16,600 --> 00:43:19,460
So please spread your legs wider

821
00:43:19,880 --> 00:43:22,320
Okay, looks good

822
00:43:22,320 --> 00:43:24,940
Oh, is this the Kaminarimon?

823
00:43:24,940 --> 00:43:25,850
Woohoo

824
00:43:28,400 --> 00:43:29,730
Oof...

825
00:43:29,730 --> 00:43:32,560
It's pretty rare to go through the Kaminarimon like this

826
00:43:32,560 --> 00:43:35,330
Oof...woohoo...

827
00:43:35,770 --> 00:43:39,370
You're such a small Kaminarimon, huh?   -Yes

828
00:43:40,280 --> 00:43:42,430
A narrowed Kaminarimon   -I'm short

829
00:43:42,430 --> 00:43:44,840
What did you say?   -Because I'm short

830
00:43:44,840 --> 00:43:47,700
Why is this different from the Kaminarimon that I know?

831
00:43:47,700 --> 00:43:49,700
Because I'm short

832
00:43:51,470 --> 00:43:52,690
But it looks attractive from here

833
00:43:52,690 --> 00:43:53,420
Thank you

834
00:43:53,420 --> 00:43:55,880
Why is it so attractive?

835
00:43:56,890 --> 00:43:58,060
So attractive...

836
00:43:58,060 --> 00:44:00,660
Well, let's go for the next one?

837
00:44:00,660 --> 00:44:02,160
Let's do more

838
00:44:02,160 --> 00:44:04,350
What will this be?

839
00:44:04,350 --> 00:44:07,730
(Amazing! How come no one is laughing?)
-Piano performance

840
00:44:07,730 --> 00:44:09,730
How should we do a piano performance?

841
00:44:09,730 --> 00:44:12,670
Because you're a lady, so you can be the pianist

842
00:44:12,670 --> 00:44:15,200
And I'll be the piano

843
00:44:15,200 --> 00:44:17,240
Please give a performance, come on

844
00:44:17,240 --> 00:44:18,900
Yes, good, just like that

845
00:44:24,860 --> 00:44:26,400
Why classical music?

846
00:44:27,080 --> 00:44:29,270
Come on, play over there too, the high notes

847
00:44:29,270 --> 00:44:30,680
The high notes...

848
00:44:30,680 --> 00:44:32,610
The high notes...

849
00:44:32,610 --> 00:44:34,230
The keyboard is down there

850
00:44:35,350 --> 00:44:36,790
The keyboard...not here...

851
00:44:38,860 --> 00:44:40,410
Where is the keyboard?

852
00:44:42,190 --> 00:44:44,950
Come on, tell me where is the keyboard?

853
00:44:44,950 --> 00:44:47,040
Keyboard? I can't find the keyboard...

854
00:44:47,040 --> 00:44:49,580
Aha? You're ignoring one part of the keyboard, huh?

855
00:44:49,580 --> 00:44:51,670
No, I'm not   -She's ignoring one part, right?

856
00:44:52,220 --> 00:44:54,170
You're ignoring one part of the keyboard, huh?

857
00:44:58,480 --> 00:45:00,720
She's definitely ignoring one part

858
00:45:01,660 --> 00:45:03,080
Let's go for the next one

859
00:45:03,080 --> 00:45:05,080
What will it be?

860
00:45:05,640 --> 00:45:07,690
Driving a bulldozer

861
00:45:08,210 --> 00:45:10,230
How do you drive a bulldozer?

862
00:45:10,230 --> 00:45:11,490
How should we do this?

863
00:45:11,490 --> 00:45:12,660
Do you know how to drive?

864
00:45:12,660 --> 00:45:14,000
Yes, I do

865
00:45:14,000 --> 00:45:16,000
Okay, then let's do this...

866
00:45:16,000 --> 00:45:17,670
Just drive like this

867
00:45:18,020 --> 00:45:19,850
Drive like this?

868
00:45:19,850 --> 00:45:21,910
What do you mean to drive like this?

869
00:45:22,380 --> 00:45:23,380
Sit over here

870
00:45:23,380 --> 00:45:24,870
Sit over there?   -Yes

871
00:45:24,870 --> 00:45:25,960
Why?

872
00:45:25,960 --> 00:45:28,310
Ah, that's embarrassing!

873
00:45:29,640 --> 00:45:30,790
Please sit over here

874
00:45:30,790 --> 00:45:32,140
That's embarrassing!

875
00:45:32,140 --> 00:45:33,640
You have to sit here to drive

876
00:45:33,640 --> 00:45:34,820
No, no, no...

877
00:45:34,820 --> 00:45:36,770
I've chosen you from many other applicants

878
00:45:36,770 --> 00:45:38,980
I could have chosen anybody   -Okay

879
00:45:38,980 --> 00:45:40,980
Not okay, please sit over here

880
00:45:40,980 --> 00:45:44,200
That's embarrassing!   -You have to sit here

881
00:45:44,200 --> 00:45:46,050
Sit over here, this is the chair...yes, good...

882
00:45:46,050 --> 00:45:47,040
Move forward, more, more...

883
00:45:47,040 --> 00:45:48,850
Eh?   -More, more...move forward

884
00:45:49,400 --> 00:45:51,430
You have to sit here to drive

885
00:45:51,430 --> 00:45:53,630
Because this is the chair

886
00:46:00,750 --> 00:46:01,600
You have to move forward

887
00:46:01,600 --> 00:46:03,940
But that's so embarrassing!

888
00:46:03,940 --> 00:46:06,540
Come on...   -That's embarrassing!

889
00:46:10,850 --> 00:46:11,850
What's this?

890
00:46:11,850 --> 00:46:14,240
Sixty nine? What does that mean?

891
00:46:14,240 --> 00:46:15,720
Sixty nine?

892
00:46:17,230 --> 00:46:18,790
That's my age

893
00:46:30,810 --> 00:46:33,770
That was close, that was so close

894
00:46:37,310 --> 00:46:38,520
I just can't take this anymore

895
00:46:44,230 --> 00:46:46,660
The shyness is just right, which makes her really cute

896
00:46:46,660 --> 00:46:48,890
Thank you very much

897
00:46:48,890 --> 00:46:53,180
She's not being overly excited, which is brilliant

898
00:46:53,180 --> 00:46:55,920
Yamauchi was very close, but...

899
00:46:55,920 --> 00:46:58,160
Barely safe

900
00:46:58,160 --> 00:47:00,060
Koba!

901
00:47:00,060 --> 00:47:02,060
You completely laughed, right?

902
00:47:02,060 --> 00:47:03,980
Yes, I laughed   -You completely laughed

903
00:47:03,980 --> 00:47:04,980
Let's take a look

904
00:47:07,470 --> 00:47:08,600
What's this?

905
00:47:08,600 --> 00:47:10,950
Sixty nine? What does that mean?

906
00:47:10,950 --> 00:47:12,310
Sixty nine?

907
00:47:13,980 --> 00:47:15,980
That's my age

908
00:47:19,560 --> 00:47:20,920
You clearly laughed

909
00:47:20,920 --> 00:47:24,090
But it's a pleasant laugh

910
00:47:24,090 --> 00:47:26,660
A heartful laugh   -Yes

911
00:47:26,660 --> 00:47:28,310
So...

912
00:47:28,310 --> 00:47:31,140
You're out

913
00:47:36,100 --> 00:47:41,340
I really want to watch that 69 though

914
00:47:42,340 --> 00:47:45,940
Four more people left

915
00:47:45,940 --> 00:47:48,620
Well, actually...

916
00:47:48,620 --> 00:47:50,950
This may sound like an excuse

917
00:47:51,890 --> 00:47:56,870
But the casting was terrible for me

918
00:47:56,870 --> 00:47:58,160
How come?

919
00:47:58,160 --> 00:48:02,010
I came here to pick a fight, but then I found out they're all my friends

920
00:48:08,870 --> 00:48:12,910
And I was panicked because of that

921
00:48:12,910 --> 00:48:17,650
On top of that, those pleasant moments just got me laughing

922
00:48:17,650 --> 00:48:24,340
So I laughed twice, both because I felt warm and pleasant

923
00:48:24,580 --> 00:48:25,930
Do you need to put on that much?

924
00:48:25,930 --> 00:48:27,280
What the heck is this?

925
00:48:27,280 --> 00:48:28,850
What a gentle penis

926
00:48:29,670 --> 00:48:31,040
Yeah, he has a smart penis

927
00:48:31,040 --> 00:48:33,040
It looks like a Mizuame now

928
00:48:33,770 --> 00:48:36,870
I came here to be banned by the broadcaster, that's how determined I was

929
00:48:36,870 --> 00:48:41,870
But then, I simply had a good time

930
00:48:45,970 --> 00:48:47,560
Let's start

931
00:48:49,460 --> 00:48:50,980
This scared me

932
00:48:52,540 --> 00:48:54,510
Can I take these off now?

933
00:48:54,710 --> 00:48:55,220
Eh?

934
00:48:55,220 --> 00:48:56,120
Can I take these off?

935
00:48:56,120 --> 00:48:59,140
Yeah sure, of course   -It looks scary

936
00:48:59,140 --> 00:49:00,630
Oh, really?

937
00:49:03,300 --> 00:49:04,500
Can you take these off for me?

938
00:49:04,500 --> 00:49:08,570
No, no way   -Too scary to touch other's eyes

939
00:49:12,590 --> 00:49:16,140
This is actually my first time to wear contacts by myself

940
00:49:16,140 --> 00:49:17,860
But others can't take it off for you

941
00:49:17,860 --> 00:49:19,770
Others can't? Legally speaking?

942
00:49:19,770 --> 00:49:21,770
Not legally, but still...

943
00:49:23,970 --> 00:49:26,330
Well, legally speaking, of course others can

944
00:49:26,330 --> 00:49:28,510
Hygienically...   -Hygienically speaking?

945
00:49:28,510 --> 00:49:30,510
It's dirty

946
00:49:32,230 --> 00:49:33,310
Eh?

947
00:49:33,310 --> 00:49:35,310
Tissue?

948
00:49:36,900 --> 00:49:39,360
I've been rubbing my eyes like this

949
00:49:39,360 --> 00:49:43,530
Don't use tissues   -Just take it off with your hands

950
00:49:44,600 --> 00:49:48,540
Not yet, not yet, go further

951
00:50:30,370 --> 00:50:32,580
Jeez, I really need to touch my eyes

952
00:50:41,510 --> 00:50:43,470
Wait a second, wait a second...

953
00:50:43,470 --> 00:50:45,380
Wait a second, come on...

954
00:50:45,380 --> 00:50:46,400
Come on, wait a second...

955
00:50:46,400 --> 00:50:49,100
Why do I need to laugh at testicles?

956
00:50:52,550 --> 00:50:54,120
Did you laugh before?

957
00:50:54,120 --> 00:50:55,960
Are you out?

958
00:50:55,960 --> 00:50:56,840
They're so mean

959
00:50:56,840 --> 00:50:59,340
These 3 guys are so mean   -Yes, they're so mean

960
00:50:59,340 --> 00:51:01,340
But you just have to accept it

961
00:51:02,360 --> 00:51:05,780
You completely laughed out loud

962
00:51:05,780 --> 00:51:06,950
Let's take a look

963
00:51:07,960 --> 00:51:09,840
Jeez, I really need to touch my eyes

964
00:51:19,110 --> 00:51:20,760
Wait a second, wait a second...

965
00:51:22,800 --> 00:51:24,530
You completely laughed out loud, huh?

966
00:51:24,530 --> 00:51:25,650
Yes, I'm sorry

967
00:51:25,650 --> 00:51:27,600
You're out!

968
00:51:27,600 --> 00:51:29,040
Hooray!   -At this point in time?

969
00:51:34,030 --> 00:51:36,840
Zakoshi is too damn strong   -He's too damn strong

970
00:51:36,840 --> 00:51:39,190
No, no, not really

971
00:51:39,190 --> 00:51:42,380
He doesn't even seem to be enduring

972
00:51:43,570 --> 00:51:44,990
Let's go

973
00:51:45,230 --> 00:51:46,590
Sorry, good luck everyone

974
00:51:46,590 --> 00:51:49,990
Only 40 minutes left, 40 minutes

975
00:51:50,330 --> 00:51:53,280
Come on, I even scored some points...arghh...

976
00:51:53,280 --> 00:51:55,000
I'm so freaking frustrated

977
00:51:55,680 --> 00:51:58,810
I watched all four seasons, but honestly...

978
00:51:58,810 --> 00:52:01,990
It feels completely different to be on the spot

979
00:52:01,990 --> 00:52:04,210
All of the people around me are so amazing

980
00:52:04,210 --> 00:52:07,310
And I started to feel ashamed for the gags that I've prepared

981
00:52:07,310 --> 00:52:11,020
It really takes courage to perform, even if I'm prepared

982
00:52:11,020 --> 00:52:15,650
Does anyone have a...PSP charger?

983
00:52:15,650 --> 00:52:18,110
No, we don't

984
00:52:18,110 --> 00:52:19,270
Oh jeez

985
00:52:19,270 --> 00:52:29,070
But for being able to stay until the last 40 minutes, I think I did a great job

986
00:52:33,200 --> 00:52:35,870
Let's start

987
00:52:38,670 --> 00:52:42,780
May I call my helper now?

988
00:52:42,780 --> 00:52:44,740
You even have a helper?   -Yes

989
00:52:44,810 --> 00:52:46,450
Sure, of course   -May I?

990
00:52:46,450 --> 00:52:47,590
Please come in

991
00:52:47,590 --> 00:52:49,880
Zakoshi's helper

992
00:52:49,880 --> 00:52:51,720
He's my junior

993
00:52:51,720 --> 00:52:52,870
From the same agency?

994
00:52:52,870 --> 00:52:54,330
Yes, also from Sony

995
00:52:54,330 --> 00:52:56,920
His name is Charming Jiro

996
00:52:58,770 --> 00:52:59,590
Is he ready?

997
00:52:59,590 --> 00:53:00,970
Please come in

998
00:53:07,200 --> 00:53:08,830
Nice to meet you

999
00:53:08,830 --> 00:53:10,830
-Jiro-chan, show us that gag
-Eh? Which one?

1000
00:53:10,830 --> 00:53:12,650
Show us Female version, Female version

1001
00:53:12,650 --> 00:53:13,800
Female version?   -Female version

1002
00:53:13,800 --> 00:53:15,040
Eh? Female version?   -Yes

1003
00:53:15,040 --> 00:53:16,960
But I need some time to prepare

1004
00:53:16,960 --> 00:53:20,810
Come on, dude! You came in here and you still need time to prepare? No way!

1005
00:53:20,810 --> 00:53:23,200
Sorry, but well...I really need some time to prepare

1006
00:53:23,200 --> 00:53:25,040
No you don't!

1007
00:53:25,040 --> 00:53:27,970
Fine, prepare yourself over there then

1008
00:53:27,970 --> 00:53:29,970
Female version, right?   -Yes, Female version

1009
00:53:29,970 --> 00:53:32,130
Eh? Female version?   -Yes, Female version

1010
00:53:32,130 --> 00:53:35,320
Hurry up! Get cracking and come back quickly!

1011
00:53:35,320 --> 00:53:37,260
Hurry up, you got me? Female version

1012
00:53:40,240 --> 00:53:41,630
Female version?

1013
00:53:41,630 --> 00:53:44,760
Hey! Hey!......Hey! Hey! Hey! Hey!

1014
00:53:44,760 --> 00:53:46,440
Female version! Hey!

1015
00:53:46,440 --> 00:53:48,020
Male Version! Hey!

1016
00:53:48,020 --> 00:53:49,440
Female version! Hey!

1017
00:53:49,440 --> 00:53:51,190
Male Version! Hey!

1018
00:53:59,980 --> 00:54:01,590
Hooray! We did it!

1019
00:54:01,590 --> 00:54:03,720
Yeah, they got him

1020
00:54:03,720 --> 00:54:05,950
That was really surprising

1021
00:54:05,950 --> 00:54:10,100
The speed of him getting changed   -Yeah, the speed

1022
00:54:10,700 --> 00:54:14,970
His speed...oh, nice to meet you   -Nice to meet you

1023
00:54:14,970 --> 00:54:17,880
Never met you with your clothes on, but nice to meet you

1024
00:54:17,880 --> 00:54:18,730
Thank you very much

1025
00:54:18,730 --> 00:54:20,440
That lightning speed is unbelievable

1026
00:54:20,670 --> 00:54:24,080
That really surprised me   -He's really fast

1027
00:54:24,080 --> 00:54:26,180
Yeah, he really is

1028
00:54:26,180 --> 00:54:28,430
Let's take a look

1029
00:54:29,360 --> 00:54:30,610
Show us Female version

1030
00:54:30,610 --> 00:54:32,800
Eh? Female version?   -Yes, Female version

1031
00:54:32,800 --> 00:54:36,010
Hurry up! Get cracking and come back quickly!

1032
00:54:36,010 --> 00:54:38,520
Hurry up, you got me? Female version

1033
00:54:38,520 --> 00:54:42,240
(We're back to those naked jokes again)

1034
00:54:42,240 --> 00:54:45,400
Hey! Hey!......Hey! Hey! Hey! Hey!

1035
00:54:45,400 --> 00:54:47,100
Female version! Hey!

1036
00:54:47,100 --> 00:54:48,590
Male Version! Hey!

1037
00:54:48,590 --> 00:54:50,250
Well, you just have to accept it

1038
00:54:55,510 --> 00:54:57,780
Zakoshi and me alone?

1039
00:54:57,780 --> 00:54:59,970
Only us? Only me and Junior-san?

1040
00:54:59,970 --> 00:55:00,820
Yep

1041
00:55:00,820 --> 00:55:02,150
Oh, really?   -Yes

1042
00:55:02,150 --> 00:55:03,270
Okay, come on!

1043
00:55:03,270 --> 00:55:06,580
Yamauchi worked really hard too

1044
00:55:06,580 --> 00:55:10,610
I really aimed to win the contest, honestly

1045
00:55:10,610 --> 00:55:13,200
But when I first saw his face

1046
00:55:13,200 --> 00:55:16,600
He doesn't even look like a comedian

1047
00:55:16,600 --> 00:55:18,680
Which is already so funny

1048
00:55:18,680 --> 00:55:25,400
He looks more like a writer or researcher

1049
00:55:25,400 --> 00:55:31,010
He got changed in lightning speed and came out naked

1050
00:55:31,010 --> 00:55:34,350
And that's not even Female version

1051
00:55:34,350 --> 00:55:36,080
Female version! Hey!

1052
00:55:36,080 --> 00:55:37,540
Male Version! Hey!

1053
00:55:37,540 --> 00:55:41,540
Arghh...I really want to stay for a bit longer

1054
00:55:41,540 --> 00:55:43,820
I'm frustrated, but...

1055
00:55:43,820 --> 00:55:46,340
Zakoshi is just...

1056
00:55:46,340 --> 00:55:48,120
Too damn strong...
