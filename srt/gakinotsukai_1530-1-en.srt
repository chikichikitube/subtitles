1
00:00:00,480 --> 00:00:02,690
The First Annual Gaki no Tsukai ya Arahende, Chiki Chiki

2
00:00:02,690 --> 00:00:05,300
My gun is my finger and mouth!

3
00:00:05,300 --> 00:00:07,460
Finger Survival Game~!!

4
00:00:07,460 --> 00:00:10,870
Thank you very much!

5
00:00:10,870 --> 00:00:12,440
Thank you?

6
00:00:12,440 --> 00:00:14,350
What do you mean?

7
00:00:14,350 --> 00:00:16,770
For having such a peaceful event

8
00:00:16,770 --> 00:00:17,580
Please explain the rule

9
00:00:17,580 --> 00:00:20,700
-We will be playing survival game today
-Yeah, that's why we're dressed like this

10
00:00:20,700 --> 00:00:25,280
However, due to budget constraints,
we weren't able to prepare the guns

11
00:00:25,280 --> 00:00:27,410
That's the most important thing though

12
00:00:27,410 --> 00:00:28,840
You have to prepare that dude

13
00:00:28,840 --> 00:00:32,050
It was impossible. All of the money was spent on these costumes

14
00:00:32,050 --> 00:00:33,940
And this banner as well

15
00:00:33,940 --> 00:00:35,810
No way, we don't need this banner

16
00:00:35,810 --> 00:00:39,440
But guys, look, we have fingers right?

17
00:00:39,440 --> 00:00:41,520
So we will be using these today

18
00:00:41,520 --> 00:00:43,450
You mean to use our fingers as a gun...

19
00:00:43,450 --> 00:00:45,700
Yes, use your fingers as if it is a gun

20
00:00:45,960 --> 00:00:47,630
Give it a shot, Endo

21
00:00:48,880 --> 00:00:51,060
Not even close dude, take this seriously

22
00:00:51,060 --> 00:00:53,290
The gun doesn't looks like it's fired at all

23
00:00:56,660 --> 00:00:58,210
Yeah, it's fired

24
00:00:58,210 --> 00:01:00,250
You just wanted to embarrass him

25
00:01:00,250 --> 00:01:02,480
Please stop that

26
00:01:02,480 --> 00:01:03,610
Let's welcome the guests

27
00:01:03,610 --> 00:01:07,330
These 3 guests will be joining today's game too

28
00:01:07,330 --> 00:01:09,080
It's always these 3 guests

29
00:01:09,080 --> 00:01:13,340
Are you the stressed out version of Mukku?

30
00:01:09,080 --> 00:01:17,070
*Mukku is a wild man mascot for the kids tv show "Hirake! Ponkiki"

31
00:01:13,340 --> 00:01:17,070
No, I'm not the actor inside

32
00:01:17,070 --> 00:01:19,960
Should we all try to shoot our gun once?

33
00:01:19,960 --> 00:01:21,810
To check out how it looks

34
00:01:21,810 --> 00:01:23,380
Yeah, let's give it a shot

35
00:01:23,380 --> 00:01:27,980
And we will choose our team members based on your shot

36
00:01:27,980 --> 00:01:30,520
You're right, so we have to take a look first

37
00:01:30,520 --> 00:01:33,290
We want to choose the most destructive members

38
00:01:33,290 --> 00:01:36,210
Can this even be destructive?

39
00:01:36,210 --> 00:01:38,010
We need to show our destructiveness?

40
00:01:38,010 --> 00:01:39,110
Yes, of course

41
00:01:39,110 --> 00:01:43,790
Show us your attack power with your fingers

42
00:01:43,790 --> 00:01:45,310
Let's start the game!

43
00:01:45,310 --> 00:01:50,240
Rock, paper...Scissors!!!

44
00:01:50,240 --> 00:01:54,220
-That's a scissor
-So you lost

45
00:01:54,220 --> 00:01:58,870
This gave me a headache

46
00:01:58,870 --> 00:02:01,170
Because you're shouting out loud all of a sudden

47
00:02:01,170 --> 00:02:05,140
Anyway, Hamada can choose first, and I'll choose next

48
00:02:05,140 --> 00:02:07,890
Tanaka, can you show us your weapon?

49
00:02:07,890 --> 00:02:11,510
I brought a Rifle today

50
00:02:11,510 --> 00:02:13,480
You're not using your fingers dude

51
00:02:13,480 --> 00:02:15,500
That is cheating

52
00:02:15,500 --> 00:02:17,630
That's a Tanegashima gun dude

53
00:02:15,500 --> 00:02:19,370
*Tanegashima gun is a type of arquebus firearm introduced to Japan through the Portuguese Empire in 1543

54
00:02:17,630 --> 00:02:19,370
Yeah, that's a firearm

55
00:02:19,370 --> 00:02:22,550
I'm just loading the gun

56
00:02:22,550 --> 00:02:23,700
That's a shotgun right?

57
00:02:23,700 --> 00:02:24,660
Buff

58
00:02:24,660 --> 00:02:26,010
Buff?

59
00:02:26,010 --> 00:02:28,420
-Your gun is wet
-What's up with him?

60
00:02:28,420 --> 00:02:30,400
I told you your gun is wet!!

61
00:02:30,400 --> 00:02:31,760
Fujiwara show us your weapon

62
00:02:31,760 --> 00:02:34,180
-I brought a rocket launcher
-I see

63
00:02:34,180 --> 00:02:36,480
Wow, really?

64
00:02:40,200 --> 00:02:41,890
That must be powerful

65
00:02:41,890 --> 00:02:43,320
That's amazing

66
00:02:43,320 --> 00:02:45,780
Endo, show us your weapon please

67
00:02:45,780 --> 00:02:48,620
I'll be dual-wielding two .44 Magnums

68
00:02:48,620 --> 00:02:51,020
No one use that in a survival game dude

69
00:02:51,020 --> 00:02:56,330
-The one in Dirty Harry right?
-That was really cool

70
00:02:58,440 --> 00:03:00,480
That's not a dual, that's singular

71
00:03:00,480 --> 00:03:03,530
But it's amazing

72
00:03:03,530 --> 00:03:04,940
It seems to have a high hit rate

73
00:03:04,940 --> 00:03:05,940
I can go like this too

74
00:03:05,940 --> 00:03:07,430
Inamoto, show us your weapon

75
00:03:07,430 --> 00:03:10,150
I'll be using grenades

76
00:03:10,150 --> 00:03:12,300
So I'll be hiding somewhere, and then...

77
00:03:14,840 --> 00:03:16,340
That's so quiet

78
00:03:16,340 --> 00:03:18,680
Shout it out louder dude

79
00:03:18,680 --> 00:03:21,590
You're listening to the sound of your own voice

80
00:03:21,590 --> 00:03:22,340
Yama-chan, show us please

81
00:03:22,340 --> 00:03:24,120
I just want to use the machine gun

82
00:03:24,120 --> 00:03:26,500
And it's a huge one

83
00:03:31,320 --> 00:03:33,560
That's weak

84
00:03:33,560 --> 00:03:36,170
What was that "huuu" in the beginning

85
00:03:36,170 --> 00:03:39,840
Because some bullets are empty

86
00:03:39,840 --> 00:03:41,050
What do you mean by empty?

87
00:03:41,050 --> 00:03:43,380
Seriously, some bullets could be empty

88
00:03:43,380 --> 00:03:44,970
Fujimon, please show us

89
00:03:44,970 --> 00:03:47,650
I will use a gun with silencer

90
00:03:47,650 --> 00:03:49,710
Okay, I see

91
00:03:52,330 --> 00:03:55,430
What are you doing dude

92
00:03:55,430 --> 00:03:58,660
-There's no sound because of the silencer
-Well, I know

93
00:03:58,660 --> 00:04:00,030
Tanmen, show us

94
00:04:00,030 --> 00:04:01,640
Tanmen is familiar with these

95
00:04:01,640 --> 00:04:03,230
Sorry, but I'll be professional

96
00:04:03,230 --> 00:04:06,090
I'll use land mines

97
00:04:07,410 --> 00:04:09,680
So that's game over

98
00:04:09,680 --> 00:04:11,790
Eh, no sound?

99
00:04:15,320 --> 00:04:19,440
That's just a sprain

100
00:04:20,430 --> 00:04:23,110
It's absolutely fine to step on it

101
00:04:23,110 --> 00:04:25,650
But it's actually very powerful

102
00:04:25,650 --> 00:04:27,450
How about Non-chan?

103
00:04:28,360 --> 00:04:32,860
I'll be swinging the axe

104
00:04:32,860 --> 00:04:37,190
It's not the end of an Oogiri

105
00:04:37,190 --> 00:04:39,430
But there's no more other weapons

106
00:04:39,430 --> 00:04:42,800
It's fine to overlap too

107
00:04:42,800 --> 00:04:45,560
I'll choose Fujiwara

108
00:04:45,560 --> 00:04:49,030
The leaders are choosing the members, and forming their teams

109
00:04:51,130 --> 00:04:55,450
These are the members of the two teams

110
00:04:56,280 --> 00:04:59,110
This is the map for this battlefield

111
00:04:59,110 --> 00:05:04,000
To win the game, you need to take
the opponent team's flag at the other end

112
00:05:04,000 --> 00:05:08,050
And you're out if you got shot

113
00:05:09,130 --> 00:05:13,300
The two teams are now having a
strategy meeting before the game starts

114
00:05:13,300 --> 00:05:15,610
So let's start the meeting

115
00:05:15,610 --> 00:05:17,810
This is the map of the battlefield

116
00:05:17,810 --> 00:05:20,480
Maybe we can make use of these obstacles

117
00:05:20,480 --> 00:05:22,230
But let's predict their attack first

118
00:05:22,230 --> 00:05:23,830
Maybe they'll split into two groups?

119
00:05:23,830 --> 00:05:24,910
Split into two groups...

120
00:05:24,910 --> 00:05:27,580
Inomoto, how will you attack if you are Hamada?

121
00:05:27,580 --> 00:05:29,050
Keep in mind that he's an idiot

122
00:05:29,050 --> 00:05:30,760
If I'm Hamada-san?

123
00:05:30,760 --> 00:05:32,920
I'll just go straight from here

124
00:05:32,920 --> 00:05:35,250
Will Hamada-san even be the one to attack though?

125
00:05:35,250 --> 00:05:37,170
Then maybe everyone except Hamada

126
00:05:37,170 --> 00:05:39,290
But we win if we get Hamada right?

127
00:05:39,290 --> 00:05:42,230
No, we need to get their flag

128
00:05:42,700 --> 00:05:44,830
You know nothing about the rules

129
00:05:44,830 --> 00:05:45,800
We have rules for this?

130
00:05:45,800 --> 00:05:47,670
We lose if they take our flags

131
00:05:47,670 --> 00:05:50,710
We don't even have guns, yet we still have rules?

132
00:05:50,710 --> 00:05:52,830
There's nothing we can do about that

133
00:05:52,830 --> 00:05:55,300
But we do have a flag though

134
00:05:55,300 --> 00:05:56,840
-We can't let them take this?
-Yes

135
00:05:56,840 --> 00:06:00,140
So someone must stay here right?

136
00:06:00,140 --> 00:06:01,310
Yes, you're right

137
00:06:02,350 --> 00:06:05,820
On the other hand, for Hamada's team

138
00:06:05,940 --> 00:06:09,730
We just need to take that red flag in front of us right?

139
00:06:09,730 --> 00:06:12,130
Yeah, it's right in front of us

140
00:06:12,130 --> 00:06:13,920
But frontal assault is risky

141
00:06:13,920 --> 00:06:22,130
I am short and I move fast, so maybe I can attack from behind

142
00:06:22,130 --> 00:06:22,990
That's amazing

143
00:06:22,990 --> 00:06:26,250
But Non-chan should be able to move without being noticed right?

144
00:06:26,250 --> 00:06:33,980
Maybe I can hide in the bushes around Matsumoto's team

145
00:06:33,980 --> 00:06:37,440
If they are in danger, help them out with your Bazooka

146
00:06:37,440 --> 00:06:41,250
Then I will cover them at the back

147
00:06:41,250 --> 00:06:43,260
Just shoot it like "Don! Don!"

148
00:06:43,260 --> 00:06:45,460
-It's actually right there
-Yes

149
00:06:45,460 --> 00:06:46,650
It's not that far

150
00:06:46,650 --> 00:06:50,000
-Just to be safe, can you stay behind Endo?
-Yes, no problem

151
00:06:50,000 --> 00:06:51,960
So Endo will be staying here

152
00:06:51,960 --> 00:06:54,780
And we four will split into two groups

153
00:06:54,780 --> 00:06:56,130
So I'll pair up with Inomoto

154
00:06:56,130 --> 00:06:57,820
-I'll pair up with Housei-san
-Yes

155
00:06:57,820 --> 00:07:00,240
And we'll attack from here and there respectively

156
00:07:00,240 --> 00:07:02,360
Who will be attacking from the front?

157
00:07:02,360 --> 00:07:05,950
Maybe I'll go, because I brought a scope as well

158
00:07:05,950 --> 00:07:07,940
But you're using rifle though

159
00:07:07,940 --> 00:07:10,150
You need a lot of time to take aim

160
00:07:10,150 --> 00:07:15,570
My gun is automatic so I can just go like "Ba ba ba ba ba"

161
00:07:15,570 --> 00:07:19,860
Having the captain to attack from the front is very helpful anyway

162
00:07:19,860 --> 00:07:22,190
That's the most dangerous role

163
00:07:22,190 --> 00:07:25,400
Someone should stay and protect the flag right?

164
00:07:25,400 --> 00:07:30,120
-Tanaka can just snipe the approaching enemies
-I see

165
00:07:30,120 --> 00:07:32,930
Then I will stay here

166
00:07:32,930 --> 00:07:35,940
-Snipe them with you rifle
-I got it

167
00:07:35,940 --> 00:07:37,360
So the defense is perfect

168
00:07:37,360 --> 00:07:39,080
Yes, it is

169
00:07:40,440 --> 00:07:43,950
Both teams finished their meeting

170
00:07:43,950 --> 00:07:49,580
The fierce battle of finger survival game starts now!

171
00:07:49,580 --> 00:07:52,350
Are you guys ready?

172
00:07:52,350 --> 00:07:54,090
The battle...

173
00:07:54,090 --> 00:07:56,150
START

174
00:07:56,150 --> 00:07:57,390
Ok, let's do this

175
00:07:57,390 --> 00:08:00,010
Should we move forward?

176
00:08:00,010 --> 00:08:04,330
Let's go over there

177
00:08:04,330 --> 00:08:06,470
-Tanaka, can you do it?
-Yes, please leave it to me

178
00:08:06,470 --> 00:08:08,290
Please instruct us if something happens

179
00:08:08,290 --> 00:08:09,270
Okay, got it

180
00:08:09,270 --> 00:08:11,060
Start moving if you're attacking from behind

181
00:08:15,800 --> 00:08:16,550
They're moving

182
00:08:42,150 --> 00:08:43,840
Nice Tanaka, that's a nice one

183
00:08:52,520 --> 00:08:55,990
Did they notice me!?

184
00:08:55,990 --> 00:08:57,520
I thought I was disguised in the bushes

185
00:09:07,770 --> 00:09:10,130
Please come back and help if I'm in danger

186
00:09:38,670 --> 00:09:39,710
Cover me, cover me!

187
00:09:39,710 --> 00:09:41,300
They're not dying at all

188
00:09:52,430 --> 00:09:54,610
Nothing?

189
00:09:54,610 --> 00:09:56,590
He didn't notice me

190
00:09:58,440 --> 00:10:00,660
Someone's coming

191
00:10:00,660 --> 00:10:02,300
Someone is coming!

192
00:10:10,100 --> 00:10:13,230
You're out dude!!

193
00:10:14,600 --> 00:10:15,760
I got you dude

194
00:10:27,920 --> 00:10:29,130
I got him, I got him

195
00:10:32,970 --> 00:10:34,190
Cover me, cover me

196
00:10:34,190 --> 00:10:35,640
Cover me, cover me

197
00:11:06,780 --> 00:11:08,650
They're all out!!

198
00:11:11,470 --> 00:11:13,890
Hey, stop for a moment!!

199
00:11:14,080 --> 00:11:16,600
Stop for a moment guys

200
00:11:16,600 --> 00:11:19,370
Stop!!

201
00:11:19,370 --> 00:11:20,930
Gather up!!

202
00:11:21,880 --> 00:11:23,190
Just stop for a moment

203
00:11:23,190 --> 00:11:26,110
You've just bumped your head

204
00:11:26,110 --> 00:11:27,380
But he never dies

205
00:11:27,380 --> 00:11:28,900
Wait a moment guys

206
00:11:28,900 --> 00:11:30,670
Let's do this properly

207
00:11:30,670 --> 00:11:31,810
Yeah, let's do this properly

208
00:11:31,810 --> 00:11:33,910
You guys never die

209
00:11:33,910 --> 00:11:36,780
You were shot for several times

210
00:11:36,780 --> 00:11:37,630
For many times

211
00:11:37,630 --> 00:11:39,550
You actually missed it

212
00:11:39,550 --> 00:11:43,930
I even shot you in the head for so many times, and you just pretend you didn't notice it

213
00:11:43,930 --> 00:11:45,800
Because he was wearing a helmet

214
00:11:45,800 --> 00:11:47,000
Yeah, the helmet saved my life

215
00:11:47,800 --> 00:11:50,660
-Even the rocket launcher was fired
-But it didn't hit us

216
00:11:50,660 --> 00:11:51,700
It's a launcher dude

217
00:11:51,700 --> 00:11:53,800
It was very close though

218
00:11:53,800 --> 00:11:56,200
You guys should all be dead already

219
00:11:56,200 --> 00:11:58,020
For example, who are you talking about?

220
00:11:58,020 --> 00:12:00,840
You guys were all standing here like idiots

221
00:12:00,840 --> 00:12:03,400
You guys should all be dead

222
00:12:03,400 --> 00:12:05,970
Because Komoto never dies

223
00:12:05,970 --> 00:12:09,600
-All you guys stepped on my land mines
-So you all should be dead

224
00:12:09,600 --> 00:12:10,670
I got everyone

225
00:12:10,670 --> 00:12:13,850
You're just making it up now dude

226
00:12:13,850 --> 00:12:17,250
What pisses me off is that Fujimoto punched me in the head

227
00:12:17,250 --> 00:12:20,920
That's because I put a grenade right in front of you,
and you're still not blown away

228
00:12:20,920 --> 00:12:22,090
Why aren't you blown away?

229
00:12:22,090 --> 00:12:26,080
Because I already shot everyone, and still no one is dead

230
00:12:26,080 --> 00:12:31,520
There was a hole in your stomach, a big hole

231
00:12:31,520 --> 00:12:35,630
Even before that, I shot you in the head

232
00:12:35,630 --> 00:12:37,770
I told you the helmet saved my life right?

233
00:12:37,770 --> 00:12:40,600
I knew that, and I shot you in the neck as well

234
00:12:40,600 --> 00:12:43,710
There was a big hole in his stomach, and he can still run

235
00:12:43,710 --> 00:12:44,930
Wait a second...

236
00:12:44,930 --> 00:12:46,270
Where have you been Iwao?

237
00:12:46,270 --> 00:12:49,150
I killed Fujimoto with one shot

238
00:12:49,150 --> 00:12:51,250
-No you didn't
-With one shot

239
00:12:51,250 --> 00:12:54,920
He confused me with the bushes,
and kept on shooting the bushes instead

240
00:12:54,920 --> 00:12:59,400
You were just shooting at the bushes, not me

241
00:12:59,400 --> 00:13:02,080
Just look at his costume, of course I'll confuse him with the bushes

242
00:13:02,080 --> 00:13:05,940
Yeah, so you were just shooting at the bushes

243
00:13:05,940 --> 00:13:07,900
This is difficult

244
00:13:07,900 --> 00:13:10,160
You have to make it clear if you were shot

245
00:13:10,160 --> 00:13:13,440
Let's just shout that "I was shot"

246
00:13:13,440 --> 00:13:15,960
That's the manner for survival game

247
00:13:15,960 --> 00:13:18,230
You have to be honest and say it yourself

248
00:13:18,230 --> 00:13:20,280
Only if it hits though

249
00:13:20,280 --> 00:13:22,570
And leave the field after that

250
00:13:22,570 --> 00:13:25,150
Let's start again

251
00:13:25,150 --> 00:13:26,130
Let's do this properly

252
00:13:26,130 --> 00:13:27,880
I'm gonna play seriously this time

253
00:13:27,880 --> 00:13:29,960
We were always serious though

254
00:13:30,340 --> 00:13:35,970
The two teams returned to their base again

255
00:13:36,230 --> 00:13:38,430
Komoto why were you surrounded by them?

256
00:13:38,430 --> 00:13:43,370
I've set up the land mines before they came

257
00:13:43,370 --> 00:13:46,180
But even if I shout "bomb, bomb", they just ignore it

258
00:13:47,220 --> 00:13:49,460
When I arrived, you were already surrounded by them

259
00:13:49,460 --> 00:13:51,150
Yeah, like being honeycombed

260
00:13:51,150 --> 00:13:53,600
For this time

261
00:13:53,600 --> 00:13:56,470
Endo can be attacking aggressively

262
00:13:56,470 --> 00:14:01,660
And I'll be protecting the flag

263
00:14:01,660 --> 00:14:05,270
If someone approaches here, then I'll shout "Gather up!!"

264
00:14:05,270 --> 00:14:08,580
And we all gather to shoot him, and make him a honeycomb

265
00:14:08,580 --> 00:14:09,620
So they have no excuse

266
00:14:09,620 --> 00:14:10,760
Yes, no excuse

267
00:14:10,760 --> 00:14:13,770
Maybe we can even hide and let them approach

268
00:14:13,770 --> 00:14:16,200
So like a trap, let one of them approach first

269
00:14:16,200 --> 00:14:18,140
And shoot him together, so he must die

270
00:14:18,140 --> 00:14:21,310
Exactly, after Matsumoto shouts "Gather up", we gather and attack

271
00:14:21,310 --> 00:14:25,150
So we won't be moving a lot this time

272
00:14:25,150 --> 00:14:26,950
They must be terrified

273
00:14:26,950 --> 00:14:28,760
Like "why aren't they coming at all?"

274
00:14:28,760 --> 00:14:30,380
Are you guys ready?

275
00:14:30,380 --> 00:14:31,750
Yes we are

276
00:14:31,750 --> 00:14:34,660
The battle starts

277
00:14:34,660 --> 00:14:38,100
Okay, let's go

278
00:14:38,100 --> 00:14:40,450
Don't let them come near here

279
00:14:40,450 --> 00:14:43,070
-Tanaka, you have to stop them
-Yes, no problem

280
00:14:44,000 --> 00:14:46,370
Don't go far guys

281
00:14:46,370 --> 00:14:49,430
Maybe we can just hide over there

282
00:14:49,430 --> 00:14:51,240
They're coming

283
00:14:51,240 --> 00:14:53,910
I'll move forward from the left hand side

284
00:14:53,910 --> 00:14:56,070
I'm moving from the left side as well

285
00:14:56,070 --> 00:14:59,230
Good, Fujiwara, keep it up and attack from behind

286
00:14:59,230 --> 00:15:01,280
Is everything fine at your end?

287
00:15:01,280 --> 00:15:03,360
No one is approaching yet

288
00:15:04,580 --> 00:15:05,750
They're coming

289
00:15:05,750 --> 00:15:07,520
Two people are coming

290
00:15:07,880 --> 00:15:10,990
Enemy at 11 o'clock!

291
00:15:12,220 --> 00:15:13,860
They are here! One enemy at 11 o'clock!

292
00:15:13,860 --> 00:15:14,900
How many meters away?

293
00:15:14,900 --> 00:15:17,520
Eh, 10 meters

294
00:15:17,520 --> 00:15:20,170
One enemy at 2 o'clock!

295
00:15:20,170 --> 00:15:23,340
He's over there! Iwao is over there!

296
00:15:23,340 --> 00:15:24,880
They're coming!

297
00:15:24,880 --> 00:15:27,740
-Keep on going Fujiwara
-Please! Fujiwara!

298
00:15:28,100 --> 00:15:30,850
Fujiwara, remember to fire the launcher at a good timing

299
00:15:33,850 --> 00:15:35,820
Good job, Fujiwara!

300
00:15:35,820 --> 00:15:39,090
They're here!

301
00:15:39,740 --> 00:15:41,210
They are in front of us!

302
00:15:41,210 --> 00:15:43,140
Captain! Please give the order!

303
00:15:43,140 --> 00:15:44,280
Not yet, not yet!

304
00:15:44,280 --> 00:15:45,980
They're coming!

305
00:15:45,980 --> 00:15:47,260
One enemy, one enemy is here!

306
00:15:47,260 --> 00:15:48,430
They're coming

307
00:15:48,430 --> 00:15:50,700
It's Iwao! Iwao is here!

308
00:15:50,700 --> 00:15:52,360
Please! Captain! Please give the order!

309
00:15:52,360 --> 00:15:56,310
Gather up!!

310
00:16:14,500 --> 00:16:16,790
I'll throw a grenade

311
00:16:20,920 --> 00:16:23,380
Launcher!!

312
00:16:23,380 --> 00:16:25,520
Here comes the launcher

313
00:16:27,180 --> 00:16:28,360
I got them! Come on!

314
00:16:28,360 --> 00:16:30,080
They should be blown away!!

315
00:16:30,080 --> 00:16:34,850
They should be blown away! It's a launcher dude!
Why are they still shouting "Bang bang"

316
00:16:45,080 --> 00:16:47,460
Come on, you can do it!

317
00:17:06,530 --> 00:17:08,540
Let's do this properly!!

318
00:17:10,690 --> 00:17:12,090
Ouch!

319
00:17:12,090 --> 00:17:14,580
Let's do this properly!!

320
00:17:16,810 --> 00:17:18,810
What are you doing?

321
00:17:18,810 --> 00:17:21,660
What are you doing?

322
00:17:21,980 --> 00:17:25,560
You guys were all standing over there

323
00:17:25,560 --> 00:17:28,540
And Fujiwara fired the launcher at all you guys

324
00:17:28,540 --> 00:17:29,200
They should be dead

325
00:17:29,200 --> 00:17:31,090
They should all be dead right?

326
00:17:31,090 --> 00:17:33,720
And I shot everyone again to make sure they're all dead

327
00:17:33,720 --> 00:17:36,800
Everyone should be dead

328
00:17:36,800 --> 00:17:39,800
Why are you guys all standing here anyway?

329
00:17:39,800 --> 00:17:42,570
Captain!! Where are you captain?

330
00:17:42,570 --> 00:17:44,980
Captain, captain...

331
00:17:44,980 --> 00:17:47,810
I went to take the flag on my own...

332
00:17:47,810 --> 00:17:50,450
I thought you asked us to fight here

333
00:17:50,450 --> 00:17:51,600
Because no one was defending

334
00:17:51,600 --> 00:17:53,980
I'm asking why are they all standing here?

335
00:17:53,980 --> 00:17:55,830
-Captain was also here
-Really?

336
00:17:55,830 --> 00:17:59,460
-And launcher killed all of them
-Yeah, they must be dead

337
00:17:59,460 --> 00:18:02,330
Well, we have something like Sentsu beans

338
00:18:02,330 --> 00:18:03,040
Sentsu?

339
00:18:03,040 --> 00:18:05,660
The beans from Dragon ball, it heals us immediately

340
00:18:05,660 --> 00:18:06,780
No matter how severe the wound is

341
00:18:06,780 --> 00:18:08,360
You need to eat it though

342
00:18:08,360 --> 00:18:10,910
They didn't eat it, I went "bang bang" before that

343
00:18:12,950 --> 00:18:17,080
Can you stop saying "that was close",
and pretend you weren't shot?

344
00:18:17,080 --> 00:18:19,000
No, that was close

345
00:18:19,000 --> 00:18:19,850
It almost got me

346
00:18:19,850 --> 00:18:21,950
I chopped your head off with beam saber dude

347
00:18:21,950 --> 00:18:24,540
So I immediately put my head back, that was close

348
00:18:24,540 --> 00:18:26,520
You're just making up everything

349
00:18:26,520 --> 00:18:28,600
Let's take some good scenes

350
00:18:28,600 --> 00:18:29,860
Let's take some good scenes

351
00:18:29,860 --> 00:18:31,340
What do you mean by good scenes?

352
00:18:31,340 --> 00:18:35,460
Just take some good scenes separately and combine them

353
00:18:35,460 --> 00:18:37,040
This will be the same forever

354
00:18:37,040 --> 00:18:38,950
Even if we start again

355
00:18:38,950 --> 00:18:39,640
No one will die

356
00:18:39,640 --> 00:18:41,320
Let us discuss about this first

357
00:18:41,320 --> 00:18:43,400
Why are they trying to decide everything?

358
00:18:43,400 --> 00:18:46,840
If we just combine the scenes, it's no longer a game

359
00:18:46,840 --> 00:18:49,320
And we were completely advantageous

360
00:18:49,320 --> 00:18:50,690
They are just too weak

361
00:18:50,690 --> 00:18:51,780
Let captain decide it

362
00:18:51,780 --> 00:18:54,180
Yeah, let captain decide it

363
00:18:56,020 --> 00:18:58,640
Agreed

364
00:18:58,640 --> 00:19:00,210
What was that discussion for?

365
00:19:00,210 --> 00:19:01,780
Captain?

366
00:19:01,780 --> 00:19:04,030
So agreed?

367
00:19:04,030 --> 00:19:06,250
Everyone agrees?

368
00:19:06,250 --> 00:19:08,930
Their captain said yes

369
00:19:10,230 --> 00:19:15,870
As this seems to last forever,
we decided to take separate scenes instead

370
00:19:15,870 --> 00:19:18,140
Okay, good work

371
00:19:18,140 --> 00:19:21,230
That was good, that's a good scene

372
00:19:25,360 --> 00:19:27,420
Okay, done

373
00:19:27,420 --> 00:19:29,420
Thank you

374
00:19:31,980 --> 00:19:35,850
Endo, do you want to die in one shot

375
00:19:35,850 --> 00:19:39,470
Or should I shoot many shots like "da da da", which one do you like?

376
00:19:39,470 --> 00:19:43,600
-The latter one please
-Okay

377
00:19:43,600 --> 00:19:46,390
Okay, done

378
00:19:46,390 --> 00:19:47,330
That was amazing

379
00:19:47,330 --> 00:19:50,310
It's pitiful

380
00:19:51,200 --> 00:19:55,130
All scenes finished

381
00:20:23,880 --> 00:20:26,580
Here comes the launcher

382
00:20:49,040 --> 00:20:50,820
Leave me alone and move on!

383
00:20:50,820 --> 00:20:52,070
What the heck are you talking about!

384
00:20:52,070 --> 00:20:54,420
-We'll survive together
-Sorry

385
00:21:09,970 --> 00:21:12,790
Watch out!

386
00:21:37,700 --> 00:21:38,760
Shoot it!

387
00:21:38,760 --> 00:21:41,890
No, I can't! It may hit Hamada-san!

388
00:21:41,890 --> 00:21:43,350
It will be fine, so just shoot!

389
00:22:25,180 --> 00:22:30,170
Papa will be back before your birthday

390
00:22:30,170 --> 00:22:32,800
Papa will be back for sure

391
00:22:39,060 --> 00:22:42,210
Only the two leaders survived till the end

392
00:22:42,210 --> 00:22:47,780
We will break the tie with a contest on quick shot

393
00:22:49,300 --> 00:22:50,970
Beat him captain

394
00:22:50,970 --> 00:22:53,380
So everything ends here

395
00:22:53,380 --> 00:22:54,720
Finish him captain

396
00:22:54,720 --> 00:22:56,890
Let's end this game

397
00:22:57,600 --> 00:22:58,990
Start!

398
00:23:00,100 --> 00:23:01,860
One, two...

399
00:23:01,860 --> 00:23:02,650
Three!

400
00:23:05,310 --> 00:23:09,040
That was fast

401
00:23:09,520 --> 00:23:10,340
He missed it

402
00:23:10,340 --> 00:23:12,200
Hamada is apparently faster

403
00:23:16,400 --> 00:23:17,930
Finish him captain!!

404
00:23:17,930 --> 00:23:19,550
What are you doing captain?

405
00:23:24,600 --> 00:23:28,880
That must be a new version of SmartNews CM*

406
00:23:24,600 --> 00:23:31,650
*Matsumoto and Hamada took many versions of CMs for SmartNews, and they "act" like very close friends in the CMs

407
00:23:28,880 --> 00:23:31,650
That must be for SmartNews

408
00:23:31,650 --> 00:23:33,200
(Staff) Okay!

409
00:23:33,510 --> 00:23:35,280
(Staff) Thank you very much

410
00:23:35,940 --> 00:23:37,990
Hamada turned around at two

411
00:23:37,990 --> 00:23:40,300
Eh, really? That's so mean

412
00:23:40,300 --> 00:23:43,570
That breaks the rule
