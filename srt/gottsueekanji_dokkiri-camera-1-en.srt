00:00:05,690 --> 00:00:06,340
Matsumoto!

3
00:00:06,340 --> 00:00:07,090
Yes?

4
00:00:07,160 --> 00:00:08,120
Just what shall we do?

5
00:00:08,580 --> 00:00:10,420
A new style of dokkiri camera.

6
00:00:10,490 --> 00:00:11,040
I see.

7
00:00:11,120 --> 00:00:13,140
Today we will get Kouji Higashino.
- He isn't here now, right?

8
00:00:13,140 --> 00:00:14,060
Right.

9
00:00:14,060 --> 00:00:16,760
I believe he should be
here in 10 or 15 minutes.

10
00:00:16,760 --> 00:00:17,490
Is that right?

11
00:00:17,490 --> 00:00:19,770
- Once he gets here...
we will kill him together.
- Yes?

12
00:00:21,170 --> 00:00:22,080
That's rude!

13
00:00:22,080 --> 00:00:23,280
That really would be dokkiri.

14
00:00:23,280 --> 00:00:23,920
Yes!

15
00:00:25,800 --> 00:00:27,570
We're doing an unavoidable dokkiri.

16
00:00:28,700 --> 00:00:29,650
Ah, this is unavoidable?

17
00:00:29,650 --> 00:00:30,580
Unavoidable!

18
00:00:31,160 --> 00:00:33,580
So everyone will help?

19
00:00:33,580 --> 00:00:34,220
- Yes.
- Yes.

20
00:00:34,220 --> 00:00:35,930
- We'll carry out the operation to the T.
- To the T?

21
00:00:36,050 --> 00:00:37,930
Well, Higashino should
be here any minute.

22
00:00:38,480 --> 00:00:39,760
No one gains anything from this.

23
00:00:42,650 --> 00:00:44,620
Please enjoy whatever
dokkiri we are going to do.

24
00:00:49,630 --> 00:00:54,370
Higashino entering CX

25
00:00:55,440 --> 00:00:57,970
- Good morning!
-<everyone> Good morning!

26
00:01:09,170 --> 00:01:10,940
- Konancho Chinese Restaurant...
- That place was cheap!

27
00:01:11,050 --> 00:01:12,020
Umm...

28
00:01:12,770 --> 00:01:13,770
That place...

29
00:01:13,770 --> 00:01:15,180
...it was good food, wasn't it?

30
00:01:17,010 --> 00:01:18,100
The place I went to once?

31
00:01:18,100 --> 00:01:18,920
It's a good place.

32
00:01:18,920 --> 00:01:21,360
Ah, I see. Where the
overhead crosswalk is, right?

33
00:01:21,360 --> 00:01:23,500
Yeah. Just about anything is good idea.

34
00:01:23,890 --> 00:01:25,480
- You should go with your family.
- I will.

35
00:01:25,480 --> 00:01:27,700
Take your daughter. Ah, Matsumoto
is your autograph hanging there?

36
00:01:27,820 --> 00:01:29,220
It's possible!

37
00:01:29,220 --> 00:01:31,290
Anyway, the katayaki noodle is delicious.

38
00:01:31,680 --> 00:01:32,500
Is it?

39
00:01:33,020 --> 00:01:34,640
Speaking of which your head...

40
00:01:34,640 --> 00:01:36,520
...is a katayaki noodle head, isn't it?

41
00:01:46,720 --> 00:01:47,960
It's hot!

42
00:01:48,920 --> 00:01:49,560
Hot!

43
00:01:49,660 --> 00:01:50,490
Hot!

44
00:01:50,820 --> 00:01:51,680

45
00:01:51,820 --> 00:01:52,930

47

Hot!

48
00:01:55,050 --> 00:01:55,690
Dokkiri!

49
00:02:04,810 --> 00:02:05,810
Dokkiri!

50
00:02:06,290 --> 00:02:07,080
Dokkiri!

51
00:02:07,080 --> 00:02:08,170
Were you frightened?

52
00:02:08,440 --> 00:02:09,460
Surprised?

54
00:02:11,900 --> 00:02:12,680
Surprised?

55
00:02:15,900 --> 00:02:17,090
It's not real!

56
00:02:18,260 --> 00:02:19,250
You...

57
00:02:19,250 --> 00:02:21,250
...you really look like katayaka noodles!

58
00:02:21,650 --> 00:02:22,520
Your head!

59
00:02:22,520 --> 00:02:23,540
It's not real!

60
00:02:24,080 --> 00:02:25,170
None of this is real!

61
00:02:25,170 --> 00:02:26,130
Dokkiri!

62
00:02:27,800 --> 00:02:30,690
- He still doesn't get it!
- You don't get it?

63
00:02:30,690 --> 00:02:32,290
- It's not real!
- Not real!

64
00:02:32,490 --> 00:02:33,620
Not real! Not real!

65
00:02:33,620 --> 00:02:34,600
Dokkiri!

73
00:02:54,450 --> 00:02:56,780
Please have a seat here.

74
00:02:56,780 --> 00:02:58,000
Thank you.

75
00:02:59,020 --> 00:03:03,800
I want to ask you about your
experience in "Gottsu 'A' Kanji".

76
00:03:03,800 --> 00:03:07,410
It's been a month now. How is it?

77
00:03:07,410 --> 00:03:10,940
Your own personal experience I mean.

78
00:03:17,850 --> 00:03:18,970
What did I say before?

79
00:03:19,170 --> 00:03:21,980
You said "I will be tough
and do my best" before.

80
00:03:21,980 --> 00:03:23,650
- I did?
- Yes, you did.

81
00:03:24,580 --> 00:03:32,420
Well, I am being tough...
And I am doing my best...

82
00:03:33,800 --> 00:03:34,730
Speaking of such...

83
00:03:34,730 --> 00:03:35,180
Yes?

84
00:03:35,180 --> 00:03:36,620
Your head, Mr. Higashino...

85
00:03:36,620 --> 00:03:37,100
Yes?

86
00:03:37,100 --> 00:03:39,240
...is katayaki noodles, you said, right?

87
00:03:39,380 --> 00:03:40,640
...right, right.

- Surprised?
- Dokkiri!

96

Not real!

97
00:04:17,650 --> 00:04:18,640
It's not real, I said!

98
00:04:20,140 --> 00:04:21,780
This is dokkiri!

99
00:04:22,280 --> 00:04:24,100
Luckily it's not real, right!

100
00:04:24,300 --> 00:04:25,200
It's a lie!

102
00:04:28,920 --> 00:04:30,320
This fish sausage here is not real too!

103
00:04:30,320 --> 00:04:31,760
Fish sausage is fish sausage, right?

104
00:04:32,100 --> 00:04:33,450
Not real, it is! Surprised?!

105

Scared?

106

He... he's surprised. He's scared.

107
00:04:37,620 --> 00:04:39,540
Ok, a big success!

108
00:04:43,780 --> 00:04:45,170
This went great.

109

- So surprised.
- Very surprised.

to do this to me again...

114
00:04:53,300 --> 00:04:55,140

Please open the trunk.

- Are you sure?

123

Yep, don't need it.

- This would surprise you!
- Totally surprise you!

156
00:06:42,250 --> 00:06:43,060

Your ear is loaded up!

160
00:06:53,800 --> 00:06:55,500
There's so much in your ear!

161
00:06:58,850 --> 00:07:01,160
I mean... you know, this isn't dokkiri!

162
00:07:02,530 --> 00:07:04,300
You guys have learned
the meaning wrong!

163
00:07:04,300 --> 00:07:05,210
- Dokkiri!
- Dokkiri!

164
00:07:05,210 --> 00:07:06,960
This isn't dokkiri! Not dokkiri at all!

165
00:07:06,960 --> 00:07:07,740
Why not?

166
00:07:07,840 --> 00:07:09,380
Scary yakuza. Scared for your life.

167
00:07:09,380 --> 00:07:10,500
That's dokkiri.

168
00:07:10,500 --> 00:07:11,880
What the hell is this supposed to be?!

169
00:07:12,340 --> 00:07:13,600
This is not dokkiri.

170
00:07:13,730 --> 00:07:15,400
- Amazing!
- Not dokkiri...

171
00:07:15,400 --> 00:07:16,760
It's like a facial mask!

172
00:07:17,050 --> 00:07:18,200
Didn't you go home already?

173
00:07:18,760 --> 00:07:20,640
You said you were gonna go play billiards!

174
00:07:23,170 --> 00:07:24,330
Well, anyway...

175
00:07:24,330 --> 00:07:26,210
...look at the camera, give a
peace sign and say "A big success."

176
00:07:26,210 --> 00:07:27,570
You gotta be the last
one to give a peace sign!

177
00:07:27,570 --> 00:07:29,530
Ok! A big success!

178
00:07:29,530 --> 00:07:29,970
Peace!

179
00:07:30,900 --> 00:07:33,330
"Big Success"

Higashino getting to his hotel room

181
00:07:51,610 --> 00:07:53,660
he doesn't notice the camera at all.

182
00:07:53,850 --> 00:07:55,540
I wonder.

183
00:08:09,170 --> 00:08:11,000
He's taking a piss!

184
00:08:12,720 --> 00:08:14,900
I don't wanna hear it.

185
00:08:15,180 --> 00:08:16,770
Psssssss.

186
00:08:18,180 --> 00:08:19,250
He can hear really well.

187
00:08:21,860 --> 00:08:23,170
We're horrible.

188
00:08:26,120 --> 00:08:27,680
He's getting naked!

189
00:08:40,980 --> 00:08:43,380
<whisper>

190
00:08:51,490 --> 00:08:52,680
He's wet.

191
00:08:54,370 --> 00:08:55,650
Katayaki noodles.

192
00:08:55,650 --> 00:08:58,520
We got the hotel staff in on it.
We just gotta give them a call.

193
00:08:58,730 --> 00:09:00,850
Racing around the icy mountain streams.

194
00:09:01,700 --> 00:09:03,610
Racing around the icy mountain streams.

195
00:09:03,610 --> 00:09:05,800
He's saying, "Racing around the icy mountain streams."

196
00:09:09,860 --> 00:09:11,330
Hey, let's use this when we go.

197
00:09:11,820 --> 00:09:13,050
What would we say?

198
00:09:13,050 --> 00:09:14,570
Look!

199
00:09:14,960 --> 00:09:16,100
What the hell is he doing?

200
00:09:17,820 --> 00:09:19,140
That's scary!

201
00:09:28,660 --> 00:09:29,400
- Yes?

202
00:09:29,400 --> 00:09:30,610
- This is the front desk.
- Yes?

203
00:09:30,610 --> 00:09:32,250
- Sorry to bother you right now.
- That's ok.

204
00:09:32,250 --> 00:09:35,320
We forgot to deliver a message
to you when you checked in.

205
00:09:35,320 --> 00:09:35,820
What was it?

206
00:09:35,820 --> 00:09:37,480
- Yes. Here it is.
- Ok.

207
00:09:37,660 --> 00:09:41,100
Mr. Kouji Higashino's head is
like that of katayaki noodles.

208
00:09:42,010 --> 00:09:42,660
No!

209
00:09:44,010 --> 00:09:44,660
Wait!

210
00:09:44,660 --> 00:09:52,970
This isn't dokkiri!

211
00:09:50,000 --> 00:09:52,970
Higashino's words
