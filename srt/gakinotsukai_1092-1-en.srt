00:00:00,470 --> 00:00:04,170
The Freeze King Grand Prix!!

2
00:00:18,250 --> 00:00:21,290
- Good evening.
- We have held various King Grand Prix.

3
00:00:21,760 --> 00:00:28,130
The Anger King, the Stomachache King, the Slept with Chris King, and the Takashi Impersonation King.

4
00:00:29,330 --> 00:00:31,730
- This time, we have the Freeze King, the fifth stage.
- Yes!

5
00:00:31,730 --> 00:00:35,200
- Now you were frozen, weren't you?
- Did you know that I was frozen for a moment?

6
00:00:35,300 --> 00:00:37,400
This is what they are going to do today.

7
00:00:37,400 --> 00:00:39,070
What are the rules?

8
00:00:39,070 --> 00:00:43,740
The rule is how to freeze without getting caught!

9
00:00:43,740 --> 00:00:48,480
- This is the ONLY rule this time!!
- I see.

10
00:00:48,680 --> 00:00:50,180
- Do you understand?
- Of course.

11
00:00:50,180 --> 00:00:52,250
- They will compete in this.
- What do they have to do at the end?

12
00:00:52,250 --> 00:00:56,620
When the challenger says the phrase
“That was (their name)!”, the challenge is over.

13
00:00:56,620 --> 00:00:59,530
I would like to shoot 9 episodes with this.

14
00:01:02,400 --> 00:01:05,430
Matsumoto will now explain the judging criteria.

15
00:01:05,870 --> 00:01:07,630
Will to Freeze.

16
00:01:07,630 --> 00:01:12,310
“Hey, you freeze at this point!?”
“That would get you caught!”

17
00:01:12,410 --> 00:01:16,510
- I want them to show that kind of bold spirit.
- If they do that, they'll be caught out.

18
00:01:16,610 --> 00:01:19,280
Also, Not afraid of
having dry eyes.

19
00:01:20,150 --> 00:01:23,380
“Aren't you afraid of dry eyes?”

20
00:01:23,380 --> 00:01:25,320
- Like this?
- I want them to open their eyes.

21
00:01:25,320 --> 00:01:31,760
Basically, no blinking.
They are not allowed to blink when they are frozen.

22
00:01:32,490 --> 00:01:36,430
Time Being Frozen: The time the challenger was frozen

23
00:01:36,430 --> 00:01:39,370
Soulless: To Freeze up as if one's vitality is drained.

24
00:01:39,370 --> 00:01:42,000
unexpectedness: To freeze at an unexpected timing.

25
00:01:42,000 --> 00:01:45,310
Matsumoto will judge these 5 sections.

26
00:01:45,640 --> 00:01:48,140
Come on, first challenger!

27
00:01:59,350 --> 00:02:02,020
I see, so Kinoshita is the first.

28
00:02:02,020 --> 00:02:02,820
Hi!

29
00:02:02,820 --> 00:02:05,990
- They say you are the handsomest man in this tournament.
- Really!?

30
00:02:07,030 --> 00:02:09,060
That's an old standard, isn't it!?

31
00:02:10,730 --> 00:02:21,610
[Subbed by RAIDEN 1017]

32
00:02:22,980 --> 00:02:27,910
The man with the ever-changing face.
TKO’s Kinoshita.
Here we go!

33
00:02:28,680 --> 00:02:35,660
His target is his mother, Sadako.
Will he be able to freeze confidently in front of her, who dotes on him as her son?

34
00:02:37,460 --> 00:02:41,830
It's a good season to freeze.

35
00:02:43,400 --> 00:02:46,130
This is the day it snowed the other day.

36
00:02:46,900 --> 00:02:49,070
This is a nice place.

37
00:02:49,670 --> 00:02:52,740
It’s the season when all living things freeze.

38
00:02:52,740 --> 00:02:54,440
No way!

39
00:02:54,440 --> 00:02:57,680
I hear the shabu-shabu at this restaurant is delicious.

40
00:02:58,180 --> 00:03:01,380
He's a good son to bring his mother to a place like this.

41
00:03:01,380 --> 00:03:05,350
- It's not often you get to be alone with your mom.
- I was nervous.

42
00:03:05,350 --> 00:03:06,920
Cheers!

43
00:03:06,920 --> 00:03:09,790
Does she drink beer first?

44
00:03:11,790 --> 00:03:12,960
She's still drinking.

45
00:03:12,960 --> 00:03:17,130
You've been on TV a lot, do you enjoy it?

46
00:03:17,130 --> 00:03:21,630
I'm having fun. How do you feel about me being on TV?

47
00:03:21,630 --> 00:03:29,410
- I think if you enjoy your life, you should be on TV.
- Is that so?

48
00:03:30,740 --> 00:03:33,680
Does it benefit you that I'm on TV?

49
00:03:34,450 --> 00:03:38,450
- F R E E Z E -

50
00:03:39,820 --> 00:03:43,990
You look like a thumb!

51
00:03:44,660 --> 00:03:46,190
You're caught by her!

52
00:03:46,930 --> 00:03:49,000
- Don't get caught!
- I was just stretching.

53
00:03:49,000 --> 00:03:53,470
- Oh, my back hurts.
- That's not good.

54
00:03:53,470 --> 00:03:55,570
What do you think about TKO?

55
00:03:55,570 --> 00:04:01,640
You guys even hosted one recently.
"Wow! Seriously!?" I thought.

56
00:04:01,640 --> 00:04:04,080
You always send me your work schedule.

57
00:04:07,910 --> 00:04:10,750
That's nice!
So nice!

58
00:04:10,750 --> 00:04:12,220
- I like it!
- Are you listening?

59
00:04:12,520 --> 00:04:14,220
Hey, she's asking you.

60
00:04:14,220 --> 00:04:16,160
It's Ta-chan(his brother) on the phone.

61
00:04:17,190 --> 00:04:18,460
Hi.

62
00:04:26,370 --> 00:04:27,200
That’s nice!

63
00:04:29,900 --> 00:04:32,570
Your mom is frozen, too!

64
00:04:35,240 --> 00:04:37,640
Both of you are frozen!

65
00:04:40,450 --> 00:04:42,450
Come on, speak up!

66
00:04:42,450 --> 00:04:45,690
It's like two cowboys are facing each other!

67
00:04:47,020 --> 00:04:55,460
20 minutes have passed since the start of the game.
Kinoshita, who freezes steadily, launches into a bold attack.

68
00:04:57,200 --> 00:05:02,040
I was told by a junior colleague that you have an aura of back pain.

69
00:05:02,040 --> 00:05:06,640
I was told that auras come in many colors.

70
00:05:06,640 --> 00:05:16,180
The color of Kimoto's aura that the junior saw and the color I felt when I saw him were the same. So I can see the aura, too.

71
00:05:17,380 --> 00:05:17,980
Huh!?

72
00:05:17,980 --> 00:05:19,490
So I can see the aura, too.

73
00:05:19,490 --> 00:05:21,390
- To whom?
- To anyone.

74
00:05:21,390 --> 00:05:23,860
- Then, can you see mine?
- Yeah, want me to take a see?

75
00:05:28,130 --> 00:05:30,460
He's a bad guy!

76
00:05:30,500 --> 00:05:33,030
He can't see that kind of thing!!

77
00:05:34,130 --> 00:05:35,700
This is a mastermind criminal.

78
00:05:37,200 --> 00:05:37,870
Is it not done yet?

79
00:05:37,870 --> 00:05:39,540
He can do this all he wants.

80
00:05:39,540 --> 00:05:41,870
Hey, she is asking you!

81
00:05:41,870 --> 00:05:44,080
He can do this all the time.

82
00:05:44,080 --> 00:05:46,150
This is a bad guy!

83
00:05:47,350 --> 00:05:50,250
Kinoshita, this is good.
He's changing his expression a little.

84
00:05:50,250 --> 00:05:51,480
Are you really seeing at mine?

85
00:05:53,550 --> 00:05:54,520
It's a little hard to see.

86
00:05:54,520 --> 00:05:58,960
- What the hell!
- Nice tsukkomi.

87
00:06:00,530 --> 00:06:06,730
- Also, I think I need to get a qualification.
- A qualification in what?

88
00:06:06,730 --> 00:06:10,100
A massage therapist license.

89
00:06:10,970 --> 00:06:11,900
That sounds good.

90
00:06:11,900 --> 00:06:15,040
I could give you a massage.
It would feel really good. Are you stiff?

91
00:06:15,040 --> 00:06:16,910
I'm always stiff.

92
00:06:16,910 --> 00:06:18,180
I'll do it now.

93
00:06:19,710 --> 00:06:21,780
He's a bad guy.

94
00:06:22,820 --> 00:06:24,880
He's a really bad guy.

95
00:06:25,650 --> 00:06:28,320
Oh, yeah. That feels good.

96
00:06:30,260 --> 00:06:31,960
See?

97
00:06:32,730 --> 00:06:34,960
- He's not doing anything.
- Press harder.

98
00:06:35,430 --> 00:06:36,560
Hey.

99
00:06:38,160 --> 00:06:39,570
Heey!

100
00:06:41,300 --> 00:06:42,470
Are you sleeping?

101
00:06:42,470 --> 00:06:45,910
Did you get caught by her?
That's the problem.

102
00:06:48,340 --> 00:06:50,340
You don't have to do that.

103
00:06:50,840 --> 00:06:52,010
Oh, nice.

104
00:06:52,010 --> 00:06:55,520
Just press with your fingers.

105
00:06:57,280 --> 00:06:59,390
I told you to press.

106
00:07:00,250 --> 00:07:01,720
Press right away.

107
00:07:01,720 --> 00:07:04,120
“Press right away.”

108
00:07:05,020 --> 00:07:07,760
Not bad.

109
00:07:07,760 --> 00:07:11,300
- He has a great strategy.
- Oh, he's doing it.

110
00:07:11,300 --> 00:07:15,200
Press it with your thumb.

111
00:07:17,900 --> 00:07:19,140
Yeah, that's good.

112
00:07:21,540 --> 00:07:22,940
Press harder, please!

113
00:07:22,940 --> 00:07:24,940
He scores a lot.

114
00:07:24,940 --> 00:07:26,550
Press!

115
00:07:28,880 --> 00:07:30,750
You're good.

116
00:07:36,320 --> 00:07:38,320
It hurts! Don't do that!

117
00:07:38,690 --> 00:07:41,990
- Don't bend my neck.
- I won't do that.

118
00:07:43,560 --> 00:07:46,800
Stop right there.
Stop there!

119
00:07:49,900 --> 00:07:51,000
Can you do a little more?

120
00:07:51,000 --> 00:07:52,610
He's disgusting!

121
00:07:53,310 --> 00:07:54,770
Don't overdo it.

122
00:07:55,910 --> 00:07:58,410
That feels good.

123
00:08:00,780 --> 00:08:01,510
Thank you.

124
00:08:02,220 --> 00:08:02,950
It's okay.

125
00:08:03,520 --> 00:08:04,880
That's enough for now.

126
00:08:05,690 --> 00:08:07,090
You're doing it for me.

127
00:08:10,390 --> 00:08:12,390
Gross!

128
00:08:12,890 --> 00:08:14,360
"You're doing it for me."

129
00:08:14,730 --> 00:08:15,660
Are you done?

130
00:08:16,400 --> 00:08:18,600
It was TKO's Kinoshita!!

131
00:08:21,130 --> 00:08:21,930
She's laughing so hard.

132
00:08:21,930 --> 00:08:23,770
What are you doing?!

133
00:08:27,540 --> 00:08:30,610
Kinoshita, your strategy was good.

134
00:08:30,610 --> 00:08:35,450
I went behind her to rub her shoulders, taking advantage of the fact that we are parent and child.

135
00:08:35,580 --> 00:08:38,480
You really thought that through.

136
00:08:38,480 --> 00:08:39,620
I did his evaluation.

137
00:08:39,620 --> 00:08:42,460
Now, Matsumoto-san, please show us his overall evaluation.

138
00:08:42,460 --> 00:08:44,120
Here it is.

139
00:08:44,590 --> 00:08:48,330
This is the first one, so this is the standard.

140
00:08:48,360 --> 00:08:51,730
We have never seen anyone freeze for this long.

141
00:08:51,730 --> 00:08:53,630
- There is no example.
- That's right.

142
00:08:53,630 --> 00:08:55,940
Also, your mom froze as much as you did.

143
00:08:56,700 --> 00:08:58,600
I wonder what that was about.

144
00:08:58,800 --> 00:09:00,440
Come on, next challenger!

145
00:09:13,850 --> 00:09:16,390
Thanks for inviting me.

146
00:09:17,760 --> 00:09:21,190
Is that two Shochiku Entertainments (their office)
in a row?

147
00:09:22,060 --> 00:09:23,760
You're wearing a bow tie.

148
00:09:23,760 --> 00:09:25,060
I'm glad you noticed that!

149
00:09:25,060 --> 00:09:26,500
Audience: Cute!

150
00:09:26,500 --> 00:09:29,670
Yes, I'm a Happy Boy!

151
00:09:29,870 --> 00:09:31,040
Wow!

152
00:09:32,670 --> 00:09:35,270
Your “wow” isn't very sharp today.

153
00:09:35,370 --> 00:09:37,880
That's because my neck is tight.

154
00:09:38,080 --> 00:09:40,550
I borrowed a costume with a tight neck.

155
00:09:42,920 --> 00:09:45,820
Happy Freeze Boy, here we go!

156
00:09:48,320 --> 00:09:51,020
The two targets are juniors in his office.

157
00:09:51,290 --> 00:09:54,660
Kuro-chan and Nasu-Nakanishi's Nakanishi.

158
00:09:58,530 --> 00:10:03,240
Nakanishi's buddy Nasu joins him as his collaborator.

159
00:10:04,840 --> 00:10:06,440
Hi!

160
00:10:07,840 --> 00:10:11,080
The four of them are so close that they usually go out to eat together often.

161
00:10:12,410 --> 00:10:15,550
This time, he called them up for a New Year's party.

162
00:10:16,150 --> 00:10:19,120
I'm here first again.

163
00:10:19,120 --> 00:10:21,550
- Okada-san called me, so I came late.
- Hey!

164
00:10:26,190 --> 00:10:29,530
As soon as it started, Okada made his move.

165
00:10:30,560 --> 00:10:34,900
You had a daughter, didn't you?
Has she become beautiful?

166
00:10:35,070 --> 00:10:36,940
It's creepy when you say things like that.

167
00:10:37,100 --> 00:10:41,070
Kuro-chan, don't you mind if she's your senior's daughter?

168
00:10:41,070 --> 00:10:43,910
Because I might be able to get along with my senior more.

169
00:10:49,120 --> 00:10:51,550
Is this a freeze?

170
00:10:52,790 --> 00:10:55,720
Long! It's long time!

171
00:10:58,560 --> 00:10:59,730
It’s long!

172
00:11:00,160 --> 00:11:02,360
Kuro-chan doesn't know what to do!

173
00:11:05,500 --> 00:11:07,900
You earned a lot of freezing time!

174
00:11:08,230 --> 00:11:12,870
I have a lot of problems, you know.
What month is it now?

175
00:11:13,670 --> 00:11:14,940
January.

176
00:11:15,810 --> 00:11:17,440
It's the end of January.

177
00:11:17,810 --> 00:11:18,780
Nice!

178
00:11:19,180 --> 00:11:21,710
Great. No one noticed.

179
00:11:25,580 --> 00:11:26,890
See, nobody noticed it.

180
00:11:27,420 --> 00:11:28,720
No, they're noticing!

181
00:11:29,660 --> 00:11:31,160
This is crazy!

182
00:11:31,960 --> 00:11:33,460
You were frozen for a really long time!

183
00:11:33,860 --> 00:11:35,060
It's long time!

184
00:11:36,200 --> 00:11:38,900
I've been counting from January 1 to today.

185
00:11:39,500 --> 00:11:44,040
Okada-san, do you have any jokes for us?

186
00:11:44,040 --> 00:11:47,210
Do you have any extra jokes for us, Okada-san?

187
00:11:47,210 --> 00:11:52,010
I have a joke I'm planning to do in 2012.

188
00:11:53,080 --> 00:11:54,550
Please show us that.

189
00:12:01,350 --> 00:12:03,590
The timing is too bad.

190
00:12:03,960 --> 00:12:08,590
I leave my private life to chance too

191
00:12:09,400 --> 00:12:14,970
An hour has passed since the start.
Okada made a request to the juniors.

192
00:12:15,400 --> 00:12:18,370
I asked you guys to come up with a new joke for me.

193
00:12:18,540 --> 00:12:21,840
- Are you going to give me something in return?
- No, I want another new one.

194
00:12:22,740 --> 00:12:25,850
If I get a joke from Kuro-chan, that will finally...

195
00:12:26,650 --> 00:12:29,250
- What would you like to order?
- What shall I order?

196
00:12:29,250 --> 00:12:30,350
Oolong tea, please.

197
00:12:32,920 --> 00:12:35,620
Hey, this will burn if you don't get it fast.

198
00:12:36,620 --> 00:12:38,860
He hasn't been caught!

199
00:12:41,060 --> 00:12:43,160
- He hasn't been caught yet!
- Ouch!

200
00:12:47,530 --> 00:12:50,200
He was hot, but he was trying his best!

201
00:12:54,070 --> 00:12:58,480
Think about it.
Okada-san's jokes always have the same tone of voice.

202
00:12:58,480 --> 00:13:02,350
“Gyu” “Chu” “Wow”
It's all the same.

203
00:13:02,780 --> 00:13:07,350
Okada-san is in danger if you continue like this.
From here you are going to start to get bruised very fast.
How old are you now?

204
00:13:07,350 --> 00:13:09,090
I'm 43.

205
00:13:09,090 --> 00:13:13,690
To be clear, I think your life expectancy as a comedian is up to 46 years old.

206
00:13:14,030 --> 00:13:17,600
So it would be best for Okada-san to retire at about 45 years old.

207
00:13:19,430 --> 00:13:21,670
You did a lot of things though.

208
00:13:22,500 --> 00:13:24,740
Then you can become a legend.

209
00:13:24,870 --> 00:13:27,440
So he has to find his new joke by the age of 45.

210
00:13:27,440 --> 00:13:30,880
Yes, by the time he turns 45 you must find a new Okada.

211
00:13:30,880 --> 00:13:33,850
Kuro-chan, think of a joke that will work for him for a long time.

212
00:13:34,080 --> 00:13:35,680
How about this?

213
00:13:36,850 --> 00:13:37,780
I'll take a picture...

214
00:13:38,080 --> 00:13:40,450
Say, cheese! Bow-wow!

215
00:13:40,450 --> 00:13:41,790
What do you think of this?

216
00:13:43,360 --> 00:13:46,830
Nice!
This is long!
So long!

217
00:13:46,830 --> 00:13:48,090
It’s really long!

218
00:13:48,660 --> 00:13:51,360
Has he been caught by them?

219
00:13:51,460 --> 00:13:54,100
- He still hasn't been caught by them!
- It's long!

220
00:13:55,600 --> 00:13:58,370
So long!

221
00:14:04,210 --> 00:14:05,880
Yeah, he must have hurt his eyes.

222
00:14:07,550 --> 00:14:09,720
I feel sorry for myself.

223
00:14:09,720 --> 00:14:11,650
You should retire at 45.

224
00:14:11,650 --> 00:14:14,220
This year I have to gabve...

225
00:14:15,450 --> 00:14:16,990
What did you say?

226
00:14:17,490 --> 00:14:20,560
It was Keiichi Okada who was deteriorating badly.

227
00:14:20,560 --> 00:14:22,090
Wow!!

228
00:14:27,700 --> 00:14:29,700
I see.

229
00:14:30,100 --> 00:14:33,640
My evaluation of your joke isn't very positive.

230
00:14:35,040 --> 00:14:36,340
Let me see.

231
00:14:36,340 --> 00:14:37,910
Here it is.

232
00:14:38,880 --> 00:14:41,650
His Time Being
Frozen was amazing.

233
00:14:41,650 --> 00:14:46,190
Also, he wasn't afraid of dry eyes in a smoky situation at a barbecue.

234
00:14:46,190 --> 00:14:50,860
- His eyes were pretty open.
- I'm glad he was doing pretty well.

235
00:14:50,860 --> 00:14:52,990
Come on, next challenger!

236
00:15:05,570 --> 00:15:07,170
They're a duo.

237
00:15:07,940 --> 00:15:11,140
Usually only one of you does this, but who did it this time?

238
00:15:11,140 --> 00:15:14,050
This time we did it as a duo.

239
00:15:14,050 --> 00:15:21,790
Doing it as a duo makes the freeze more solid.

240
00:15:22,660 --> 00:15:27,290
A combination of filth and perversity.
Cocorico.
Here we go!

241
00:15:28,560 --> 00:15:34,970
As a meeting for the duo's 20th anniversary show, they called their former manager Tachibana and show writer Horie.

242
00:15:37,200 --> 00:15:41,440
First, Endo waits alone for his targets.

243
00:15:48,580 --> 00:15:49,820
It's been a long time.

244
00:15:50,820 --> 00:15:53,950
- Haven't you gained even more weight?
- Yes!

245
00:15:55,490 --> 00:15:59,290
- How much do you weigh now?
- About 120kg (265lb).

246
00:16:01,060 --> 00:16:03,700
Endo started to move.

247
00:16:05,000 --> 00:16:07,370
Here is an old picture of me.

248
00:16:08,570 --> 00:16:11,370
Oh, you are good!

249
00:16:13,040 --> 00:16:17,810
This isn't Will to Freeze, but it will earn you Time Being
Frozen.

250
00:16:21,150 --> 00:16:23,820
- You have changed a lot.
- Yes.

251
00:16:24,820 --> 00:16:27,420
After this, Tanaka finally appears.

252
00:16:28,690 --> 00:16:32,090
What kind of freeze will they really show us?

253
00:16:33,760 --> 00:16:35,590
Hi!

254
00:16:37,700 --> 00:16:40,270
- What the hell!
- Nice!!

255
00:16:40,870 --> 00:16:42,300
Great!

256
00:16:43,440 --> 00:16:44,800
I was going to do it from the beginning.

257
00:16:44,800 --> 00:16:47,140
- You're already frozen?
- Yes!

258
00:16:47,140 --> 00:16:50,540
- You've gained even more weight.
- I met you a month ago.

259
00:16:50,540 --> 00:16:53,610
- He got fat.
- Yeah.

260
00:16:53,610 --> 00:16:57,120
You've gained more weight since a month ago.

261
00:16:59,850 --> 00:17:01,620
Cheers!

262
00:17:01,620 --> 00:17:03,460
- I'm sorry for calling you guys suddenly.
- Don't worry about it.

263
00:17:03,460 --> 00:17:14,370
We had an idea for our 20th anniversary show.
I'd like to have all of our managers from the past 20 years perform.

264
00:17:16,870 --> 00:17:18,800
Is Endo freezing right now?

265
00:17:20,370 --> 00:17:23,480
I did it while Tanaka had their attention.

266
00:17:26,010 --> 00:17:31,050
- Next April will be your 20th anniversary?
- Yes.

267
00:17:33,490 --> 00:17:35,250
This is crazy!

268
00:17:36,120 --> 00:17:38,890
I'm getting their attention.

269
00:17:39,390 --> 00:17:41,990
It's nice of you two to do it together!

270
00:17:46,300 --> 00:17:48,570
Is this a clothing store mannequin?

271
00:17:48,900 --> 00:17:52,400
- It's nice!
- Is this a United Arrows mannequin?

272
00:17:52,670 --> 00:17:56,540
- Now they only see Endo.
- Yes I’m taking advantage of that.

273
00:17:56,640 --> 00:17:58,910
This is possible because you are a duo.

274
00:17:58,910 --> 00:18:00,780
Yeah, that's in May...

275
00:18:03,820 --> 00:18:06,350
- Great!
- Tanaka, you earn points.

276
00:18:06,350 --> 00:18:10,520
You look like a picture in a magazine!

277
00:18:15,690 --> 00:18:16,760
You do it in a row!

278
00:18:17,100 --> 00:18:18,930
You guys are not getting caught at all!

279
00:18:19,130 --> 00:18:21,500
- Now I’m speaking.
- You have their attention.

280
00:18:21,500 --> 00:18:22,300
It's a duo play.

281
00:18:22,300 --> 00:18:24,840
- D O U B L E    F R E E Z E -

282
00:18:24,840 --> 00:18:26,070
Double!?

283
00:18:27,470 --> 00:18:29,310
This is awesome!

284
00:18:30,040 --> 00:18:31,580
They're freezing too!!

285
00:18:32,180 --> 00:18:34,350
They're all freezing!!

286
00:18:37,520 --> 00:18:39,150
This is fantastic!

287
00:18:39,690 --> 00:18:41,590
Who gets points for this!?

288
00:18:45,120 --> 00:18:46,460
It was like a photograph.

289
00:18:47,060 --> 00:18:49,130
Now that was very nice!

290
00:18:51,460 --> 00:18:54,230
- Akasaka Play BOX is closed.
- Really?

291
00:18:58,870 --> 00:19:01,840
You can earn a score on this one.

292
00:19:02,170 --> 00:19:03,080
And...

293
00:19:04,080 --> 00:19:06,040
It's a double!

294
00:19:07,880 --> 00:19:09,850
This is a video, not a still image.

295
00:19:12,650 --> 00:19:17,890
Don't do that too long or you'll get caught.

296
00:19:17,890 --> 00:19:19,420
Yeah, that's right.

297
00:19:21,360 --> 00:19:23,900
It's a long time!

298
00:19:24,560 --> 00:19:27,330
The manager can wait, after all.

299
00:19:29,500 --> 00:19:30,970
The hall is already closed.

300
00:19:32,870 --> 00:19:35,240
30 minutes have passed since the start.

301
00:19:36,180 --> 00:19:42,510
Cocorico, who is showing an exquisite combination, boldly freeze!

302
00:19:43,580 --> 00:19:45,750
- Who did you take over from?
- It's Maehara-san.

303
00:19:46,050 --> 00:19:48,650
- She smokes.
- Maehara smokes?

304
00:19:52,160 --> 00:19:53,430
He's a good actor.

305
00:19:53,730 --> 00:19:55,530
After all, he is a good actor.

306
00:20:02,670 --> 00:20:04,300
It’s a double!

307
00:20:04,300 --> 00:20:06,240
If one of you doesn't stop, you'll get caught!

308
00:20:06,240 --> 00:20:07,670
That's right!

309
00:20:10,240 --> 00:20:12,110
You guys have to alternate.

310
00:20:16,150 --> 00:20:18,780
It's easy to do when you two do this.

311
00:20:18,780 --> 00:20:20,620
I asked her, "Do you smoke, Maehara-san?".

312
00:20:22,190 --> 00:20:23,420
And what did she say?

313
00:20:23,590 --> 00:20:25,790
She said I've been smoking for a long time.

314
00:20:27,530 --> 00:20:29,800
It's not that surprising!

315
00:20:34,100 --> 00:20:36,470
If one of you doesn't stop, you'll get caught!

316
00:20:41,040 --> 00:20:45,010
They continued to freeze after this.

317
00:20:46,210 --> 00:20:49,780
They kept freezing one after another.

318
00:20:53,190 --> 00:20:55,490
When was the first time you appeared on TV?

319
00:20:55,750 --> 00:20:58,990
- Weeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeee

320
00:20:58,990 --> 00:21:01,890
- eeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeel ...
- He's freezing while speaking out loud!
- This is higher technique!

321
00:21:01,890 --> 00:21:05,500
- That was 18 years ago.
- I see, it is not against the rules to freeze while speaking out loud.

322
00:21:05,500 --> 00:21:09,330
- You ate a lot.
- Sorry.

323
00:21:09,700 --> 00:21:11,600
Should we get the check?

324
00:21:14,770 --> 00:21:19,180
It'll definitely be fun. So...

325
00:21:23,620 --> 00:21:24,950
That would make them worry.

326
00:21:25,720 --> 00:21:28,050
That will be so.

327
00:21:29,220 --> 00:21:31,320
That would make them worry.

328
00:21:33,530 --> 00:21:36,560
This is not a good freeze.

329
00:21:37,560 --> 00:21:40,470
That's all,  it was Cocorico.

330
00:21:45,070 --> 00:21:46,940
They won't know what Cocorico are talking about.

331
00:21:46,940 --> 00:21:52,080
When one of us is speaking, their attention is on that person, so the other one can act more easily.

332
00:21:52,080 --> 00:21:55,680
There were times when nothing in the room was moving.

333
00:21:56,420 --> 00:21:59,380
- All four of them froze.
- Yes, everything stopped.

334
00:21:59,920 --> 00:22:02,120
Here it is.

335
00:22:02,120 --> 00:22:10,560
It's wonderful.
But when the two of them do it together, there is no more soullessness.
Yes, because one of us is moving.

336
00:22:10,930 --> 00:22:14,970
This Double Freeze is a Extremely Freeze, so to speak.

337
00:22:18,300 --> 00:22:20,410
Next challenger, come on!

338
00:22:34,750 --> 00:22:38,760
Next week.
Freeze King Grand Prix Part 2!

339
00:22:41,930 --> 00:22:45,760
The strongest challenger will freeze in astonishing fashion!

340
00:22:56,810 --> 00:23:01,880
Next week, the Freeze King will be decided!

341
00:23:02,210 --> 00:23:04,850
[Thank you to those who were inconvenienced]

342
00:23:08,120 --> 00:23:08,850
What?!

343
00:23:08,850 --> 00:23:09,920
What the hell is this?!

344
00:23:09,920 --> 00:23:16,530
It's the Gaki's Freeze King GrandPrix.

345
00:23:16,530 --> 00:23:18,030
Huh? What do you mean?

346
00:23:18,630 --> 00:23:22,070
I don't want to meet Downtown like this.

347
00:23:28,940 --> 00:23:30,410
We're here to freeze.

348
00:23:33,850 --> 00:23:34,950
Really?

349
00:23:35,150 --> 00:23:44,860
It was like a skit.
That's why I thought the two Cocorico guys were so close.

350
00:23:45,360 --> 00:23:48,760
Do you hear something?

351
00:23:51,160 --> 00:23:52,400
What?!

352
00:23:53,030 --> 00:23:57,140
The camera was filming the whole thing.

353
00:23:57,140 --> 00:23:58,440
Here's the camera.

354
00:23:58,770 --> 00:23:59,570
Where!?

355
00:23:59,570 --> 00:24:00,370
Here it is.

356
00:24:02,610 --> 00:24:03,980
It's done filming.
