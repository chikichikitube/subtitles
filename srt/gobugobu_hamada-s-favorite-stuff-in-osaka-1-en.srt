1
00:00:00,420 --> 00:00:04,140
We're making gourmet mixed fruit juice.

2
00:00:04,570 --> 00:00:07,000
This set is 8,640 yen.

3
00:00:08,140 --> 00:00:09,710
Are these by weight?

4
00:00:10,420 --> 00:00:12,280
Yes, they are

5
00:00:12,570 --> 00:00:16,280
-Should I grab this one then?
-Go for it, so that's the price for three?

6
00:00:18,280 --> 00:00:20,850
-This can is 1,700 yen
-That's expensive.

7
00:00:21,780 --> 00:00:24,420
NOT USING AN EGG IN THE JUICE?

8
00:00:24,520 --> 00:00:25,710
What do I know?

9
00:00:25,850 --> 00:00:27,850
I've never made it myself.

10
00:00:27,850 --> 00:00:30,280
So, I don't know if you're supposed to put egg in it.

11
00:00:30,730 --> 00:00:37,360
LET'S MAKE THE BEST MIXED FRUIT JUICE - GOBU GOBU

12
00:00:37,850 --> 00:00:40,420
Seriously, I'll try to help you but...

13
00:00:40,710 --> 00:00:42,570
Let's ask those guys from Nara area about it.

14
00:00:42,850 --> 00:00:45,050
If they put egg in their fruit juice.

15
00:00:47,470 --> 00:00:48,940
Well, mixed fruit juice from Osaka...

16
00:00:49,420 --> 00:00:51,570
or ones you used to make at home had...

17
00:00:52,000 --> 00:00:54,570
egg in it?
-No, there weren't.

18
00:00:54,710 --> 00:00:56,570
No, there isn't.

19
00:00:56,850 --> 00:00:58,570
Is it because you're from Nara area?

20
00:00:58,850 --> 00:01:03,140
-Why are you picking on us from Nara?
-Aren't you from Yamaguchi area?

21
00:01:03,420 --> 00:01:06,140
-I don't believe there is one in it
-I don't think so either.

22
00:01:06,570 --> 00:01:09,710
Nara has their own culture, right?

23
00:01:10,000 --> 00:01:13,140
Nara was once the capital, it's a refined city.

24
00:01:13,280 --> 00:01:16,570
Well, it was once a capital for a very short period of time.

25
00:01:17,000 --> 00:01:19,850
No, it was for a while...

26
00:01:20,210 --> 00:01:23,000
Well, Nara's still trying to hang onto the glory...

27
00:01:23,570 --> 00:01:26,850
No, we understand it once was a capital, that's all.

28
00:01:27,850 --> 00:01:29,420
There's nothing in Nara...

29
00:01:29,710 --> 00:01:32,570
I may need a spoon here.

30
00:01:34,140 --> 00:01:36,710
Wow, a whole thing is in here.

31
00:01:37,280 --> 00:01:38,000
Look.

32
00:01:38,420 --> 00:01:42,280
Are you supposed to use the fruit itself or just the juice?

33
00:01:42,570 --> 00:01:46,280
It depend on how sweet we want the juice to be...

34
00:01:46,420 --> 00:01:48,420
The whole fruit or the juice...

35
00:01:48,710 --> 00:01:51,140
I need to try it first and see...

36
00:01:51,420 --> 00:01:55,420
We have different preference in mixed fruit juice, right?

37
00:01:55,850 --> 00:01:57,420
You think so?

38
00:01:57,710 --> 00:02:02,000
Well, you don't want to put an egg in the mix, right?

39
00:02:02,710 --> 00:02:03,710
An egg, no.

40
00:02:04,000 --> 00:02:06,570
You like the sweeter taste.

41
00:02:06,570 --> 00:02:09,850
I don't want it too sweet either...

42
00:02:10,140 --> 00:02:11,570
I'd like a happy medium...

43
00:02:11,850 --> 00:02:13,570
You'd like the sweetness from the fruit though.

44
00:02:13,710 --> 00:02:16,420
Well then...

45
00:02:16,710 --> 00:02:18,710
I'm not gonna use the juice in this can...

46
00:02:18,710 --> 00:02:19,850
Okay.

47
00:02:20,000 --> 00:02:24,280
I've been listening to this true Osaka citizen...

48
00:02:29,000 --> 00:02:31,140
This old hag from Osaka...

49
00:02:31,570 --> 00:02:35,140
is suggesting that I use both egg and juice from the can...

50
00:02:35,570 --> 00:02:38,700
So I'm guessing they'll create the truer form of mixed fruit juice...

51
00:02:38,710 --> 00:02:40,280
I see...

52
00:02:41,280 --> 00:02:44,570
Should we follow their suggestion then?

53
00:02:45,850 --> 00:02:48,570
-I'll try not to use all of the ingredients at once.
-Right.

54
00:02:49,570 --> 00:02:50,940
Alright, let's make some juice.

55
00:02:50,940 --> 00:02:52,000
You got it.

56
00:02:52,710 --> 00:02:54,850
You're gonna leave some, right?

57
00:02:55,140 --> 00:02:59,570
If we're trying different combination later...

58
00:03:00,280 --> 00:03:03,710
I see we have plenty of banana left, so I'll use lots of them.

59
00:03:03,710 --> 00:03:06,850
Yea, dump that whole bowl in there.

60
00:03:07,140 --> 00:03:08,850
Since there's plenty left over there.

61
00:03:09,850 --> 00:03:12,000
How about these apples?

62
00:03:12,280 --> 00:03:14,570
-Half, maybe
-Or it'll turn sour.

63
00:03:15,280 --> 00:03:16,420
-Three?
-One more.

64
00:03:16,710 --> 00:03:18,420
-Four then
-Yes.

65
00:03:18,570 --> 00:03:22,280
-Put those oranges too
-Got it.

66
00:03:22,710 --> 00:03:24,280
The problem is this one...

67
00:03:24,710 --> 00:03:28,570
-I'd say use about a half
-That sounds good.

68
00:03:30,570 --> 00:03:33,710
How will this not be any good?!

69
00:03:34,420 --> 00:03:37,280
-Here goes 3,000 yen worth of fruit.
-Serious?

70
00:03:37,420 --> 00:03:39,280
This is gonna be delicious.

71
00:03:42,420 --> 00:03:43,710
Throw those peaches too?

72
00:03:44,000 --> 00:03:46,140
Let's toss them in there.

73
00:03:46,420 --> 00:03:49,570
Don't worry, we still have some left.

74
00:03:50,420 --> 00:03:53,420
This has to be good.

75
00:03:56,000 --> 00:03:59,140
That's it? No milk or anything?

76
00:03:59,420 --> 00:04:01,140
Why not try it first

77
00:04:01,570 --> 00:04:06,140
without the milk, then we'll decide if we want it?

78
00:04:09,850 --> 00:04:13,570
I'm afraid it'll turn very thick without the milk.

79
00:04:14,280 --> 00:04:15,850
You're right...

80
00:04:16,280 --> 00:04:18,000
Use milk then?

81
00:04:18,570 --> 00:04:20,570
We'll do without at first.

82
00:04:21,140 --> 00:04:22,710
Huh?

83
00:04:22,710 --> 00:04:24,710
"Thicker juice setting"...

84
00:04:30,420 --> 00:04:32,140
Shut the hell up!

85
00:04:32,850 --> 00:04:34,420
Something's wrong.

86
00:04:34,710 --> 00:04:38,140
It's not turning because there's not enough liquid.

87
00:04:40,850 --> 00:04:43,280
What are you doing?

88
00:04:44,710 --> 00:04:47,000
-What are you doing?
-Sorry about that.

89
00:04:48,280 --> 00:04:49,570
But I heard them...

90
00:04:49,850 --> 00:04:52,570
say that this blender works with very little liquid.

91
00:04:52,570 --> 00:04:53,710
They said that?

92
00:04:54,000 --> 00:04:55,710
-Yes, she was sure
-Yes, now I remember.

93
00:04:56,140 --> 00:04:57,710
But it's not blending.

94
00:04:59,420 --> 00:05:01,570
Oh, now it's working.

95
00:05:02,570 --> 00:05:06,140
Man, that looks pretty thick...

96
00:05:06,570 --> 00:05:08,420
But I bet you it's good.

97
00:05:09,850 --> 00:05:12,000
Can you blend it faster? Oh there it goes.

98
00:05:13,570 --> 00:05:16,520
I remember an old school cafe used to make that same noise.

99
00:05:18,000 --> 00:05:20,140
-Looking good
-Doesn't it?

100
00:05:20,850 --> 00:05:22,710
It's a good looking color.

101
00:05:22,850 --> 00:05:24,420
Nicely done.

102
00:05:25,000 --> 00:05:26,850
I think it's done.

103
00:05:27,850 --> 00:05:31,710
How about you try it as is?

104
00:05:31,710 --> 00:05:33,710
We'll add milk if this isn't any good.

105
00:05:34,140 --> 00:05:36,280
Or add some ice to get it chilled.

106
00:05:36,850 --> 00:05:38,280
This isn't chilled for sure.

107
00:05:39,570 --> 00:05:41,140
Of course,  it's not.

108
00:05:41,570 --> 00:05:43,280
Why didn't we put any ice in?

109
00:05:43,710 --> 00:05:45,280
This is gonna be luck warm.

110
00:05:47,710 --> 00:05:49,710
How is it?

111
00:05:51,570 --> 00:05:53,000
Well...

112
00:05:53,000 --> 00:05:54,710
It's not bad but...

113
00:05:54,710 --> 00:05:57,710
it's just way too thick...

114
00:06:01,280 --> 00:06:03,850
Maybe I had higher expectation

115
00:06:04,000 --> 00:06:05,850
than this?

116
00:06:07,000 --> 00:06:09,000
I bet it needs some ice.

117
00:06:09,280 --> 00:06:10,570
It'd be better chilled.

118
00:06:10,570 --> 00:06:15,280
-Would ice lessen the flavor?
-I think it'll be okay.

119
00:06:16,420 --> 00:06:19,280
I wouldn't blend it too long.

120
00:06:20,000 --> 00:06:23,710
You should crush the ice but not too much.

121
00:06:24,000 --> 00:06:26,140
-Three ice cubes?
-How about some more?

122
00:06:26,570 --> 00:06:28,710
And no milk?

123
00:06:29,140 --> 00:06:31,420
Sounds like you know how to make it?

124
00:06:31,570 --> 00:06:33,710
No, no I don't!

125
00:06:34,140 --> 00:06:35,280
I was merely suggesting...

126
00:06:35,570 --> 00:06:37,280
-He wants milk
-You're suggesting?

127
00:06:37,710 --> 00:06:41,140
But I believe the milk would make it milder taste.

128
00:06:41,140 --> 00:06:42,710
Put some milk in then.

129
00:06:43,140 --> 00:06:46,420
It's up to you how much you want to put in.

130
00:06:53,000 --> 00:06:54,710
Maybe like this much...

131
00:06:55,140 --> 00:06:56,280
Let's blend it.

132
00:07:00,280 --> 00:07:01,570
I like the sound of that!

133
00:07:01,710 --> 00:07:04,140
I think the ice make it!

134
00:07:04,710 --> 00:07:06,280
That grinding sound is very familiar!

135
00:07:07,710 --> 00:07:09,280
Answer me, damn it!

136
00:07:11,710 --> 00:07:13,420
You couldn't hear them over the blender.

137
00:07:13,420 --> 00:07:14,850
They acknowledged.

138
00:07:15,000 --> 00:07:16,570
Pissing me off...

139
00:07:25,140 --> 00:07:27,710
It looks somewhat...

140
00:07:28,140 --> 00:07:32,420
Looks smoother, but the ones sold in store aren't this thick...

141
00:07:32,850 --> 00:07:35,280
They're less thick for sure.

142
00:07:37,710 --> 00:07:40,570
-Delicious!
-Way better than before!

143
00:07:40,710 --> 00:07:42,140
Delicious!

144
00:07:42,280 --> 00:07:44,140
Way better!

145
00:07:47,140 --> 00:07:49,420
-Really good
-Really good!

146
00:07:49,850 --> 00:07:51,420
Good.

147
00:07:52,280 --> 00:07:53,850
That must mean...

148
00:07:53,850 --> 00:07:57,710
We can add more milk...

149
00:07:58,710 --> 00:08:00,000
You want the egg?

150
00:08:00,000 --> 00:08:01,420
There it is...

151
00:08:01,710 --> 00:08:02,570
It's a risk.

152
00:08:02,710 --> 00:08:07,140
Can we try it again with more milk first?

153
00:08:08,710 --> 00:08:12,140
Yes, try it with more milk first...

154
00:08:15,280 --> 00:08:17,420
License, why don't you try it?

155
00:08:17,710 --> 00:08:18,710
It's good stuff...

156
00:08:22,850 --> 00:08:24,420
-Tasty!
-Right?

157
00:08:24,570 --> 00:08:26,850
-Awesome!
-Good!

158
00:08:29,710 --> 00:08:31,420
It's really good!

159
00:08:32,140 --> 00:08:33,570
Now what do we do?

160
00:08:33,850 --> 00:08:36,850
Don't you think the color is pretty good?

161
00:08:37,000 --> 00:08:40,280
The ones you get at the cafe looks like this. We needed more milk.

162
00:08:40,710 --> 00:08:42,280
You have a point.

163
00:08:45,000 --> 00:08:48,710
Cafe must add lots of milk to make as much juice as possible.

164
00:08:49,000 --> 00:08:50,710
I see.

165
00:08:51,000 --> 00:08:53,420
I get it. I get you!

166
00:08:56,140 --> 00:08:57,850
You have a good point.

167
00:09:03,140 --> 00:09:05,000
I believe we're getting close...

168
00:09:05,420 --> 00:09:06,710
-You sure?
-Yes.

169
00:09:08,570 --> 00:09:10,850
Look how much the color has changed!

170
00:09:11,140 --> 00:09:13,000
Right, it's more or less white.

171
00:09:20,710 --> 00:09:23,710
It taste milder than before.

172
00:09:27,140 --> 00:09:29,140
-It's good
-Very good.

173
00:09:29,140 --> 00:09:30,280
So no egg then?

174
00:09:30,710 --> 00:09:32,280
I'd say egg will add another layer.

175
00:09:32,280 --> 00:09:35,420
Why you...speaking like a champ?!

176
00:09:35,710 --> 00:09:36,420
Seriously?

177
00:09:36,570 --> 00:09:38,420
It'll help bring all the flavor back.

178
00:09:38,850 --> 00:09:40,850
The egg yolk it is.

179
00:09:42,420 --> 00:09:44,850
I could never sound that confident.

180
00:09:52,000 --> 00:09:54,280
Nice, using one hand!

181
00:09:54,710 --> 00:09:56,570
You show-off!

182
00:09:56,850 --> 00:10:00,000
I'm only going to use the yolk, okay?

183
00:10:00,710 --> 00:10:02,570
Go for two?

184
00:10:02,570 --> 00:10:06,420
Still not sure if eggs are part of the juice...

185
00:10:11,710 --> 00:10:14,710
That's what you get for showing off!

186
00:10:15,850 --> 00:10:20,570
Seriously, do we need eggs in the mixed fruit juice?

187
00:10:22,280 --> 00:10:24,850
Anybody, say anything, damn it!

188
00:10:27,570 --> 00:10:28,570
-I'm sorry!
-What the hell?!

189
00:10:28,570 --> 00:10:30,420
I can't take this anymore!

190
00:10:31,710 --> 00:10:34,000
I was preoccupied with cracking eggs.

191
00:10:34,000 --> 00:10:37,280
It's not just you, all of you!

192
00:10:37,280 --> 00:10:38,710
I mean, we got all these staff here!

193
00:10:39,140 --> 00:10:40,420
We all need to apologize.

194
00:10:43,420 --> 00:10:46,280
Hamada-san, we're sorry.

195
00:10:46,280 --> 00:10:47,850
Of course, that was our bad...

196
00:10:48,000 --> 00:10:50,570
What about the camera-man?

197
00:10:53,710 --> 00:10:56,420
-So the egg
-I'm only gonna use egg yolk.

198
00:10:58,710 --> 00:11:03,850
Wow, the color changed so much so quick.

199
00:11:04,570 --> 00:11:07,000
I think using only the egg yolk was a good idea.

200
00:11:09,850 --> 00:11:12,140
Maybe we shouldn't have put more ice...

201
00:11:13,570 --> 00:11:17,140
I think the ice made it nice and chilled...

202
00:11:17,140 --> 00:11:19,710
-So this is it
-Yes, that's it.

203
00:11:23,570 --> 00:11:25,140
I'm going to pour all of it.

204
00:11:32,420 --> 00:11:34,280
Amazing...

205
00:11:36,570 --> 00:11:39,850
This looks like the ones you get at the cafe...

206
00:11:39,850 --> 00:11:41,420
Well...

207
00:11:41,850 --> 00:11:44,140
-We did it, Hamada-san
-Yes, we did it.

208
00:11:44,850 --> 00:11:46,850
Here's our gourmet mixed fruit juice.

209
00:11:47,710 --> 00:11:49,420
The color is good.

210
00:11:49,710 --> 00:11:50,850
Fruit cost us 11,000 yen.

211
00:11:50,850 --> 00:11:52,850
The blender was 6,000 yen.

212
00:11:52,850 --> 00:11:54,280
Oh, 6,800 yen.

213
00:11:54,850 --> 00:11:56,710
We spent 20,000 yen on these.

214
00:11:57,140 --> 00:11:59,710
So this is the last attempt.

215
00:11:59,710 --> 00:12:01,570
The last attempt...

216
00:12:01,710 --> 00:12:03,570
Let's have it.

217
00:12:13,280 --> 00:12:16,000
It is...It's great like nobody's business.

218
00:12:16,140 --> 00:12:18,570
Good...

219
00:12:18,570 --> 00:12:23,000
-I must say I can't taste any of the yolk
-No, zero.

220
00:12:26,570 --> 00:12:31,570
It's way better than the juice I had at the Osaka station.

221
00:12:31,570 --> 00:12:33,000
Yes, this is very good.

222
00:12:33,420 --> 00:12:35,850
It caught me off guard because it wasn't chilled but...

223
00:12:36,710 --> 00:12:38,710
it's delicious.

224
00:12:39,420 --> 00:12:41,140
To be frank,

225
00:12:42,140 --> 00:12:44,570
I liked the one we tried two attempts ago the best.

226
00:12:47,570 --> 00:12:49,570
That was the best, wasn't it?

227
00:12:50,140 --> 00:12:52,000
The one where we're so into it.

228
00:12:52,140 --> 00:12:55,570
Well, it's hard to relive that moment...

229
00:12:55,850 --> 00:12:59,570
I'd say this is about as close to the real thing as we can get.

230
00:13:01,710 --> 00:13:04,420
Let's ask the viewers if they'd use an egg or not.

231
00:13:04,710 --> 00:13:06,710
By mail?

232
00:13:07,000 --> 00:13:09,570
Let's ask people in Osaka.

233
00:13:09,710 --> 00:13:13,570
"Do you put an egg in your mixed fruit juice?"

234
00:13:13,850 --> 00:13:16,850
Send in your postcard answering just that.

235
00:13:17,000 --> 00:13:18,710
We'll take a poll then.

236
00:13:18,710 --> 00:13:20,140
Sound good.

237
00:13:20,420 --> 00:13:24,140
This day and age, why not use Twitter? Is postcard okay?

238
00:13:24,710 --> 00:13:27,570
Postcard, it is then...

239
00:13:28,140 --> 00:13:30,570
We won't accept any other form of voting.

240
00:13:30,580 --> 00:13:35,280
Simply state if you put egg in it or not and send it in, please.

241
00:13:35,570 --> 00:13:37,710
We do have a website for this show, right?

242
00:13:37,850 --> 00:13:41,140
-There is one?
-Yes, there is.

243
00:13:41,280 --> 00:13:44,280
But no email address? Okay then.

244
00:13:44,280 --> 00:13:46,140
No email address...

245
00:13:46,280 --> 00:13:48,850
Please send in your postcard then.

246
00:13:49,140 --> 00:13:52,570
-It turned out good
-Yes, we did it.

247
00:13:57,070 --> 00:13:59,490
Here's a letter from Sakai-city in Osaka.

248
00:13:59,590 --> 00:14:01,380
Mr. Hiroaki writes...

249
00:14:01,380 --> 00:14:05,060
Greetings to Hamada-san and Atsushi, I enjoy the show every week.

250
00:14:05,480 --> 00:14:07,800
The curry episode really was really shocking...

251
00:14:08,020 --> 00:14:12,320
How could a cookbook writer like Atsuhi could get so sweaty after eating curry?

252
00:14:12,540 --> 00:14:14,440
Truthfully, I was a bit disappointed.

253
00:14:14,760 --> 00:14:17,280
Please, everyone has their weak point.

254
00:14:17,490 --> 00:14:21,480
It's refreshing to see the different side of Atushi like that,

255
00:14:21,800 --> 00:14:23,380
so I enjoy the angle of the show.

256
00:14:23,600 --> 00:14:29,490
I almost want to see what would happen if he keeps eating the curry and have the sweat going.

257
00:14:30,020 --> 00:14:30,970
One thing though...

258
00:14:31,070 --> 00:14:36,110
As Hamada-san pointed out, perhaps the show Gobu Gobu, is trying to make

259
00:14:36,230 --> 00:14:39,380
-Atsuhi look like a good person.
-He's so right about that.

260
00:14:39,800 --> 00:14:41,700
Am I wrong about that?

261
00:14:41,900 --> 00:14:42,440
You're right, sir.

262
00:14:42,650 --> 00:14:45,270
As Atsushi is known as the instigator,

263
00:14:45,690 --> 00:14:47,910
it's baffling to see him in the new light.

264
00:14:48,220 --> 00:14:50,230
Could Atsushi actually be...

265
00:14:50,440 --> 00:14:52,010
the Ryo in disguise?

266
00:14:52,110 --> 00:14:53,060
LOL...

267
00:14:53,280 --> 00:14:55,280
Shut up, not funny!

268
00:14:56,750 --> 00:14:57,800
Did you have to say that?

269
00:14:59,070 --> 00:15:00,120
See?

270
00:15:00,320 --> 00:15:03,910
But I'm not trying to make myself a good person...

271
00:15:04,120 --> 00:15:06,010
-But viewers see it otherwise
-That's right...

272
00:15:06,440 --> 00:15:10,330
I'd say the viewers are seeing the different side of you for sure...

273
00:15:10,650 --> 00:15:12,330
One thing about curry though...

274
00:15:12,550 --> 00:15:15,380
I do sweat uncontrollably...

275
00:15:15,380 --> 00:15:16,550
-Okay
-But...

276
00:15:16,750 --> 00:15:19,490
I always stop eating after few bites so my sweating stops.

277
00:15:19,810 --> 00:15:20,860
I see!

278
00:15:20,970 --> 00:15:24,010
If I keep eating the curry, I would keep sweating...

279
00:15:24,860 --> 00:15:26,860
I'd like to see that.

280
00:15:27,060 --> 00:15:28,230
Next stop...

281
00:15:28,430 --> 00:15:33,170
Hama-chan will show you what his favorite Osaka stuff is.

282
00:15:33,190 --> 00:15:34,120
What the hell?

283
00:15:34,320 --> 00:15:35,490
That's the episode?

284
00:15:35,910 --> 00:15:37,490
What is it?

285
00:15:37,690 --> 00:15:39,060
-Let's get going
-Serious?

286
00:15:39,390 --> 00:15:41,060
We're all ready to go.

287
00:15:43,180 --> 00:15:47,480
We're doing more than this mixed fruit juice?

288
00:15:48,020 --> 00:15:51,490
Amazing how much we're aimlessly running around...

289
00:15:53,490 --> 00:15:54,640
What are you gonna do?

290
00:15:55,060 --> 00:16:01,380
LET'S SHOW ATSUSHI WHAT SOME OF HAMADA'S FAVORITE THINGS ARE IN OSAKA.

291
00:16:02,530 --> 00:16:03,280
Let's start from here...

292
00:16:03,700 --> 00:16:05,600
Why are we here?

293
00:16:06,850 --> 00:16:11,390
Hama-chan will show you what his favorite things are in Osaka.

294
00:16:11,810 --> 00:16:13,180
But why here?

295
00:16:13,690 --> 00:16:15,180
Why are you asking me?

296
00:16:15,590 --> 00:16:17,280
This is what YOU like...

297
00:16:17,700 --> 00:16:18,960
Not, not really...

298
00:16:19,900 --> 00:16:22,550
I don't mean that in any disrespectful way...

299
00:16:22,750 --> 00:16:24,550
But it's not like I frequent here often...

300
00:16:25,170 --> 00:16:28,110
I personally like this place, especially the gate...

301
00:16:28,220 --> 00:16:31,380
-Well, as tourist like you.
-Right...

302
00:16:34,010 --> 00:16:34,750
But seriously....

303
00:16:34,960 --> 00:16:36,120
Look at the gate.

304
00:16:36,430 --> 00:16:37,700
Yea, I get it. But why here?

305
00:16:37,900 --> 00:16:39,390
Why here?

306
00:16:43,070 --> 00:16:44,760
You guys need to talk it over.

307
00:16:45,060 --> 00:16:46,330
You're not on the same page...

308
00:16:47,390 --> 00:16:48,110
Right.

309
00:16:48,110 --> 00:16:50,960
He's not showing me anything...

310
00:16:51,380 --> 00:16:53,600
Hama-chan knows but Atsuhi doesn't.

311
00:16:54,020 --> 00:16:54,970
I get it but...

312
00:16:55,270 --> 00:16:56,320
where the hell are we going?

313
00:17:01,070 --> 00:17:05,280
How about Bunshi-san and Tsurube-san's favorite egg salad sandwich?

314
00:17:05,590 --> 00:17:06,960
Oh, from the cafe?!

315
00:17:09,600 --> 00:17:11,280
Oh yeah, it's that way!

316
00:17:11,800 --> 00:17:12,750
You should've told me...

317
00:17:13,070 --> 00:17:15,390
I didn't know we were heading there from here?!

318
00:17:16,640 --> 00:17:17,810
I get it now...

319
00:17:18,020 --> 00:17:19,390
What's the name of the cafe?

320
00:17:19,810 --> 00:17:20,540
Cafe Kerun.

321
00:17:20,860 --> 00:17:22,760
It's by Hanjo-Tei

322
00:17:23,060 --> 00:17:25,700
-So you really like this place...
-Where?

323
00:17:26,230 --> 00:17:27,180
This cafe...

324
00:17:27,600 --> 00:17:30,970
Well, I just happened to stumble into the cafe...

325
00:17:31,170 --> 00:17:33,490
on the way to catch Rakugo show at the Hanjo-Tei.

326
00:17:34,440 --> 00:17:38,430
Rakugo performers like Tsurube-san and master Bunshi and I walked in,

327
00:17:38,960 --> 00:17:43,800
And had their favorite egg salad sandwich there.

328
00:17:44,330 --> 00:17:47,070
And I really like it....

329
00:17:47,490 --> 00:17:50,440
I remember I was really into it!

330
00:17:51,390 --> 00:17:53,690
But that's about it...

331
00:17:54,230 --> 00:17:55,810
That's where we're going?

332
00:17:56,230 --> 00:17:58,330
The sandwich was delicious for sure.

333
00:17:58,430 --> 00:18:00,120
-You loved it?
-Yes, I did.

334
00:18:00,530 --> 00:18:03,070
Look at this gorgeous building.

335
00:18:03,390 --> 00:18:05,690
How can you tell if this is s cool building....

336
00:18:05,810 --> 00:18:07,910
This is called "Toryumon".

337
00:18:08,320 --> 00:18:10,440
I know Toryumon
-Well, that's it.

338
00:18:10,640 --> 00:18:13,810
W-Why didn't you say that earlier?

339
00:18:14,110 --> 00:18:15,700
It says it right there!

340
00:18:16,970 --> 00:18:18,650
Why didn't you...

341
00:18:20,650 --> 00:18:22,120
Seriously, this is awesome...

342
00:18:22,440 --> 00:18:23,270
Nice looking gate.

343
00:18:23,690 --> 00:18:26,110
What the hell?

344
00:18:27,810 --> 00:18:31,060
This is the original Toryumon?

345
00:18:31,800 --> 00:18:35,480
So anyone who's about to take an entrance exam...

346
00:18:35,800 --> 00:18:40,320
should walk through the gate...

347
00:18:42,010 --> 00:18:43,910
And you'd be prosperous?

348
00:18:44,330 --> 00:18:46,010
Well, Tanmangu is known as the god of learning...

349
00:18:46,760 --> 00:18:47,910
We're not allowed there today?

350
00:18:48,110 --> 00:18:48,850
N-Not today...

351
00:18:48,960 --> 00:18:51,070
Get out of here.

352
00:18:52,120 --> 00:18:53,070
I'm tired of you...

353
00:18:54,020 --> 00:18:55,490
You certainly don't need to go through there.

354
00:18:58,440 --> 00:19:00,110
But I need to aim higher...

355
00:19:01,810 --> 00:19:03,280
Seriously...

356
00:19:03,700 --> 00:19:05,280
But that was a good learning...

357
00:19:05,280 --> 00:19:09,490
Are you saying if I didn't ask, we would've just ignored that?

358
00:19:10,970 --> 00:19:12,540
Yeah, just walked right by.

359
00:19:12,970 --> 00:19:15,060
What a close call.

360
00:19:15,490 --> 00:19:17,060
I'm glad I asked.

361
00:19:19,700 --> 00:19:22,750
Oh, there is Hanjo-Tei.

362
00:19:23,070 --> 00:19:26,020
Are we almost there?

363
00:19:26,650 --> 00:19:28,850
It's a pristine building.

364
00:19:29,910 --> 00:19:32,320
It's a hall mainly used for Rakugo show.

365
00:19:33,390 --> 00:19:34,860
Anyone performing today?

366
00:19:35,180 --> 00:19:36,760
I'm sure there's someone performing.

367
00:19:37,060 --> 00:19:40,020
There, look at today's program.

368
00:19:40,330 --> 00:19:41,480
I see.

369
00:19:43,390 --> 00:19:47,270
Anybody you know, Hamada-san?

370
00:19:48,020 --> 00:19:49,810
Well...

371
00:19:49,810 --> 00:19:51,810
-I don't think so
-None?

372
00:19:53,060 --> 00:19:56,850
Looks like lots of veteran performers are...

373
00:19:57,180 --> 00:19:59,900
Yea, I'm sure some of them are here to perform.

374
00:20:02,020 --> 00:20:04,020
But I don't recognize them...

375
00:20:05,490 --> 00:20:06,960
Don't you know Koeda?

376
00:20:07,280 --> 00:20:08,860
Ah yea, I do know him.

377
00:20:09,380 --> 00:20:11,180
I see Hachimitsu, too.

378
00:20:11,180 --> 00:20:12,650
Oh right...

379
00:20:13,180 --> 00:20:15,480
I see master Kinshi, too.

380
00:20:15,800 --> 00:20:17,490
Do you know Sanzo-san?

381
00:20:18,120 --> 00:20:20,020
Sanzo Katsura?

382
00:20:20,020 --> 00:20:20,120
What does he look like?
Sanzo Katsura?

383
00:20:20,120 --> 00:20:22,110
What does he look like?

384
00:20:22,440 --> 00:20:24,760
There he is, Sanzo Katsura.

385
00:20:26,960 --> 00:20:30,330
Ah yes, I know of him, yes.

386
00:20:31,070 --> 00:20:33,170
He's been around...

387
00:20:33,800 --> 00:20:36,760
-The show must be going on now
-It must be.

388
00:20:37,810 --> 00:20:39,690
Let's barge in and be the buzz-kill.

389
00:20:40,440 --> 00:20:42,230
Why don't you go right in?

390
00:20:42,960 --> 00:20:44,650
Scream as you enter the hall.

391
00:20:45,280 --> 00:20:47,800
I would never do that!

392
00:20:48,020 --> 00:20:49,490
Not even once.

393
00:20:50,320 --> 00:20:52,640
I would not disrespect the show.

394
00:20:52,860 --> 00:20:53,910
Oh my bad!

395
00:20:54,120 --> 00:20:56,230
-Huh?
-What??

396
00:20:57,490 --> 00:20:58,860
You kidding?

397
00:21:00,860 --> 00:21:02,110
Are you serious?

398
00:21:02,550 --> 00:21:03,800
What the...?

399
00:21:04,020 --> 00:21:06,550
How's this possible?!

400
00:21:06,970 --> 00:21:08,850
"Temporarily Closed"?!

401
00:21:09,590 --> 00:21:11,390
They knew we were coming...

402
00:21:11,910 --> 00:21:12,860
Serious?

403
00:21:13,060 --> 00:21:16,230
Right, they had pretty good egg salad sandwich.

404
00:21:16,550 --> 00:21:18,330
We can't just end it like that...

405
00:21:18,650 --> 00:21:22,320
Wouldn't any producer make sure the business is open?

406
00:21:22,430 --> 00:21:23,800
We're different.

407
00:21:25,490 --> 00:21:26,640
You're different?

408
00:21:27,390 --> 00:21:30,640
What kind of weird policy is that?

409
00:21:31,060 --> 00:21:32,860
What are we gonna do now?

410
00:21:32,960 --> 00:21:35,380
It's obviously closed.

411
00:21:35,380 --> 00:21:37,700
But I was so ready to eat the sandwich.

412
00:21:38,230 --> 00:21:40,020
He said, "My bad!"

413
00:21:40,970 --> 00:21:41,900
What now?

414
00:21:42,440 --> 00:21:45,270
I don't know why you're sighing...

415
00:21:46,330 --> 00:21:47,690
There's one more place...

416
00:21:48,760 --> 00:21:52,970
Why not think about the alternative while we talk?

417
00:21:53,480 --> 00:21:56,120
I have a place in mind...

418
00:21:56,850 --> 00:21:58,850
Croquette from Nakamuraya?

419
00:21:59,390 --> 00:22:01,810
Is that Hamada-san's favorite?

420
00:22:01,910 --> 00:22:03,910
Their stuff is no joke. It's awesome.

421
00:22:04,860 --> 00:22:06,530
-Is it close by?
-Yes, very close.

422
00:22:07,180 --> 00:22:09,700
Shouldn't someone make sure first...?

423
00:22:09,900 --> 00:22:11,700
Go check it out.

424
00:22:11,700 --> 00:22:13,900
Go see if people are lined up.

425
00:22:13,900 --> 00:22:15,590
I don't know what to say...

426
00:22:15,590 --> 00:22:18,860
While shooting in Tokyo, AD bothers to travel to Osaka to shop there?

427
00:22:18,860 --> 00:22:20,010
Yes, that's true...

428
00:22:20,760 --> 00:22:22,760
like while I'm shooting a drama or something.

429
00:22:22,760 --> 00:22:24,430
You make people go?

430
00:22:24,760 --> 00:22:27,380
I'm not really making 'em per se.

431
00:22:27,400 --> 00:22:30,320
If there's someone in Osaka, I would ask them...

432
00:22:31,600 --> 00:22:34,970
-You must really love it then
-It's that good.

433
00:22:35,270 --> 00:22:36,960
But I've heard they get here in bullet-train...

434
00:22:38,110 --> 00:22:40,550
So someone has to come all the say from Tokyo then?

435
00:22:40,760 --> 00:22:43,180
You say, "Go get the croquette now!!"

436
00:22:43,180 --> 00:22:44,120
You're making me look bad.

437
00:22:44,120 --> 00:22:45,700
Sure they're scared.

438
00:22:45,800 --> 00:22:46,850
Is it open?

439
00:22:46,870 --> 00:22:47,400
Yes, it's open.

440
00:22:47,440 --> 00:22:48,970
-Crowded?
-Not at all.

441
00:22:49,070 --> 00:22:51,070
-Good then
-No line.

442
00:22:52,440 --> 00:22:55,590
Why didn't you call them instead of actually going there?

443
00:22:56,010 --> 00:22:57,810
We're different that way.

444
00:22:58,010 --> 00:22:58,960
"different that way"?

445
00:22:58,960 --> 00:23:00,550
Again, I don't get that policy...

446
00:23:03,070 --> 00:23:06,640
Wait, haven't we been here before?

447
00:23:07,690 --> 00:23:10,540
Atsushi, I'm pretty this is your first time here...

448
00:23:11,060 --> 00:23:13,480
Remember, All the shopping districts look the same.

449
00:23:13,700 --> 00:23:15,600
You're just thinking of a different one.

450
00:23:16,010 --> 00:23:17,180
This is just another shopping district.

451
00:23:18,230 --> 00:23:21,490
I see this is a pretty long alley.

452
00:23:21,490 --> 00:23:23,390
This is the longest shopping alley in Japan.

453
00:23:23,590 --> 00:23:25,810
See how far it goes?

454
00:23:25,810 --> 00:23:27,060
Amazing!

455
00:23:27,390 --> 00:23:28,440
See it goes all the way over there.

456
00:23:29,910 --> 00:23:31,480
Longest shopping alley in Japan.

457
00:23:31,810 --> 00:23:32,650
It's so huge!!

458
00:23:32,650 --> 00:23:34,550
Keep it down...!

459
00:23:34,550 --> 00:23:35,900
I've never seen this!

460
00:23:37,490 --> 00:23:39,910
They are all part of the same district?

461
00:23:40,970 --> 00:23:43,690
Please, I can't even see the end of it.

462
00:23:46,410 --> 00:23:47,350
Want the tiger shirt?

463
00:23:47,380 --> 00:23:48,650
Want some clothes?

464
00:23:48,960 --> 00:23:51,070
N-No thank you...

465
00:23:51,600 --> 00:23:53,490
But they're unique...

466
00:23:54,440 --> 00:23:56,540
-Amazing animal prints...
-Crazy...

467
00:23:56,860 --> 00:24:00,110
-Very much goes with Osaka ladies
-Right?

468
00:24:00,330 --> 00:24:01,590
So Osaka....

469
00:24:02,110 --> 00:24:04,230
-So this is where...
-Only 780 yen...

470
00:24:04,230 --> 00:24:06,230
That's cheap!!

471
00:24:06,750 --> 00:24:08,850
Oh man, this is so Osaka!!

472
00:24:09,170 --> 00:24:11,490
Like how this bike is parked right here!!

473
00:24:11,700 --> 00:24:13,390
Now you're making fun of us.

474
00:24:13,390 --> 00:24:14,640
-Thank you
-I watch you on TV...

475
00:24:14,860 --> 00:24:15,910
Is this your bike, ma'am?

476
00:24:16,230 --> 00:24:18,540
-No, but I don't miss you on TV.
-Thank you

477
00:24:18,640 --> 00:24:21,180
Thank you, see you around.

478
00:24:21,180 --> 00:24:22,550
-Thank you
-Let's go.

479
00:24:22,650 --> 00:24:25,380
Why are you in such a hurry?

480
00:24:27,270 --> 00:24:30,020
It'd been nice for you to stop and wait for me...

481
00:24:30,220 --> 00:24:32,440
See how people are lined up already?

482
00:24:33,490 --> 00:24:34,760
Here?

483
00:24:36,960 --> 00:24:38,330
It's very...

484
00:24:40,430 --> 00:24:42,750
I wasn't expecting it...

485
00:24:43,070 --> 00:24:44,120
What?

486
00:24:44,120 --> 00:24:46,540
-Smaller than you expected it?
-Right.

487
00:24:46,970 --> 00:24:48,540
Yes, it's a small place.

488
00:24:48,960 --> 00:24:51,590
But you've been here many times.

489
00:24:51,910 --> 00:24:53,480
Yes so many times...

490
00:24:54,860 --> 00:24:56,650
Once people found out how much I dig this place,

491
00:24:56,650 --> 00:25:00,440
people started to recommend other places.

492
00:25:00,440 --> 00:25:02,220
Saying it's better but...

493
00:25:04,020 --> 00:25:05,390
Okay

494
00:25:05,690 --> 00:25:08,330
Oh, I see the sticker!

495
00:25:08,440 --> 00:25:09,700
Hello.

496
00:25:09,910 --> 00:25:12,110
They're the older stickers.

497
00:25:12,430 --> 00:25:15,270
Can we put these newer ones?

498
00:25:16,440 --> 00:25:18,120
I'm putting one over the old one...

499
00:25:18,120 --> 00:25:19,490
No, don't!

500
00:25:19,590 --> 00:25:21,590
Just put them below the old ones.

501
00:25:22,860 --> 00:25:23,910
Nice.

502
00:25:24,440 --> 00:25:27,380
Order for six croquettes is up!

503
00:25:27,380 --> 00:25:28,850
Anyone?

504
00:25:29,060 --> 00:25:30,430
Please, go right ahead.

505
00:25:30,650 --> 00:25:32,120
Please excuse us.

506
00:25:32,220 --> 00:25:34,750
Thank you for waiting.

507
00:25:36,320 --> 00:25:38,440
Now that I can see the inside,

508
00:25:38,860 --> 00:25:41,590
it is a pretty hefty operation.

509
00:25:43,060 --> 00:25:45,700
Oh, that wasn't it.

510
00:25:46,110 --> 00:25:49,700
I see if people are still waiting for their order.

511
00:25:50,020 --> 00:25:51,900
They're all waiting.

512
00:25:52,640 --> 00:25:57,810
Do people place their order and go off shopping?

513
00:25:58,330 --> 00:26:01,480
Order for four croquettes is up!

514
00:26:01,480 --> 00:26:03,700
Please, step right up.

515
00:26:03,900 --> 00:26:06,650
-Someone else almost got this.
-Oh, thank you.

516
00:26:06,750 --> 00:26:08,120
Thank you.

517
00:26:09,810 --> 00:26:12,220
Can we place an order for two, please?

518
00:26:12,760 --> 00:26:15,280
Two croquettes please...

519
00:26:15,690 --> 00:26:18,330
Three croquettes are ready!

520
00:26:18,330 --> 00:26:21,070
Please, ma'am.

521
00:26:21,280 --> 00:26:23,490
-That'd be 750 yen
-750 yen.

522
00:26:24,220 --> 00:26:26,320
Let me put these on...

523
00:26:26,440 --> 00:26:28,760
Can you hand him the money?

524
00:26:29,270 --> 00:26:31,280
Thank you.

525
00:26:31,590 --> 00:26:35,180
Could you put these stickers later?

526
00:26:36,850 --> 00:26:38,120
Yes, I'm the second side-kick.

527
00:26:40,120 --> 00:26:42,440
-This is it!
-Yes, from Nakamuraya.

528
00:26:45,490 --> 00:26:47,390
It's smaller than I thought...

529
00:26:49,810 --> 00:26:51,600
It's still good today!

530
00:26:52,550 --> 00:26:55,280
I'm sure they put some drugs in this...

531
00:26:55,600 --> 00:26:56,550
What?!

532
00:26:57,490 --> 00:27:00,020
There's some sketchy stuff in it to make you hooked on this.

533
00:27:00,020 --> 00:27:02,440
Am I safe eating this?

534
00:27:02,960 --> 00:27:04,860
-It's sweet!
-Right.

535
00:27:05,060 --> 00:27:06,550
It's sweet!

536
00:27:08,230 --> 00:27:10,550
This is so good...

537
00:27:11,800 --> 00:27:14,120
You're right, it's delicious!

538
00:27:14,970 --> 00:27:16,640
This is awesome.

539
00:27:17,390 --> 00:27:19,490
I'm positive this is laced with something...

540
00:27:20,960 --> 00:27:23,380
I'd say they're using quality potatoes.

541
00:27:23,600 --> 00:27:25,280
Very tasty potatoes...

542
00:27:27,280 --> 00:27:28,430
So this is...

543
00:27:28,650 --> 00:27:31,390
Hamada-san's favorite.

544
00:27:31,600 --> 00:27:33,590
Among all the croquettes we've tried,

545
00:27:33,690 --> 00:27:36,010
nobody can beat Nakamurasan.

546
00:27:36,110 --> 00:27:38,330
They're the best.

547
00:27:38,960 --> 00:27:40,430
I can see why...

548
00:27:40,650 --> 00:27:42,750
This is delicious.

549
00:27:43,060 --> 00:27:44,230
It's only 70 yen?

550
00:27:45,180 --> 00:27:47,800
Now I know why you'd go as far as to ask someone

551
00:27:48,440 --> 00:27:50,760
to go get these and share them with everyone.

552
00:27:50,860 --> 00:27:53,490
This is very unique. It's their own flavor.

553
00:27:56,860 --> 00:27:58,850
So good!

554
00:28:02,430 --> 00:28:04,320
-Shinano noodles next?
-No, we've been there...

555
00:28:05,170 --> 00:28:07,910
How many times do we have to go there?

556
00:28:09,060 --> 00:28:10,960
Well, I haven't been there yet...

557
00:28:14,330 --> 00:28:16,230
I've never been to Shinano noddle house...

558
00:28:17,800 --> 00:28:20,440
We meant to hit the sandwich place...

559
00:28:21,490 --> 00:28:22,540
But they were closed.

560
00:28:22,850 --> 00:28:25,070
So we're here, now we're off to Shinano?

561
00:28:26,860 --> 00:28:28,330
Again?

562
00:28:29,060 --> 00:28:30,860
What's going on now?

563
00:28:31,700 --> 00:28:33,480
What am I supposed to do?

564
00:28:35,480 --> 00:28:37,490
So...What am I supposed to do now?

565
00:28:37,820 --> 00:28:39,470
Camera's on, right?

566
00:28:41,370 --> 00:28:44,380
Damn, it's getting heated over there...

567
00:28:44,590 --> 00:28:46,040
I don't like it.

568
00:28:46,140 --> 00:28:48,050
The tension is killing me.

569
00:28:48,930 --> 00:28:51,270
Man, he can argue with croquette in his mouth?

570
00:28:51,700 --> 00:28:53,250
Scary...

571
00:28:53,940 --> 00:28:56,920
He's about to throw a punch or two...

572
00:28:57,260 --> 00:28:58,470
Serious?

573
00:29:00,260 --> 00:29:02,260
Should I intervene?

574
00:29:09,820 --> 00:29:12,250
Sounds like it's a no-go.

575
00:29:12,470 --> 00:29:14,160
Let's save Shinano trip for the future.

576
00:29:14,820 --> 00:29:15,920
Okay...

577
00:29:16,260 --> 00:29:17,590
-Not today?
-No, not today.

578
00:29:17,710 --> 00:29:19,040
Don't you want to go though?

579
00:29:19,140 --> 00:29:21,050
We need to talk...

580
00:29:29,250 --> 00:29:30,590
Delicious.

581
00:29:31,160 --> 00:29:32,590
They still go it.

582
00:29:43,940 --> 00:29:46,250
If you like, I can try to convince him.

583
00:29:46,370 --> 00:29:47,590
I can at least try...

584
00:29:47,920 --> 00:29:49,590
After all, we're Gobu Gobu. (50/50)

585
00:29:50,380 --> 00:29:51,480
I appreciate that.

586
00:29:51,810 --> 00:29:52,930
But...

587
00:29:53,140 --> 00:29:54,050
We're wasting time!

588
00:29:54,260 --> 00:29:55,930
Like I said...

589
00:29:56,150 --> 00:29:59,480
He may not show up at the next shooting...

590
00:29:59,820 --> 00:30:01,470
If we push our luck too much.

591
00:30:02,040 --> 00:30:02,920
Understood...

592
00:30:03,260 --> 00:30:04,590
I don't want that to happen either so...

593
00:30:04,920 --> 00:30:09,710
LET'S GO TO HAMADA'S FAVORITE PLACE!

594
00:30:14,030 --> 00:30:15,150
Okay, I'm lost again.

595
00:30:15,370 --> 00:30:16,590
Where are we going now?

596
00:30:16,820 --> 00:30:18,820
-Where to?
-Have no idea...

597
00:30:18,920 --> 00:30:22,040
So you don't know where we're heading either?

598
00:30:22,260 --> 00:30:25,590
You didn't settle with producer about where we're going next?

599
00:30:25,710 --> 00:30:31,480
I just didn't see the point of going to the Shinano noodle house again.

600
00:30:31,930 --> 00:30:34,490
So I brought that up with the producer.

601
00:30:34,700 --> 00:30:36,250
It was a peaceful argument.

602
00:30:36,470 --> 00:30:38,260
-Didn't look like that though
-But it was.

603
00:30:38,590 --> 00:30:42,260
He agreed and decided to hit the next business...

604
00:30:42,930 --> 00:30:44,930
But he didn't say exactly where to...

605
00:30:46,260 --> 00:30:49,480
-I'm clueless too
-But didn't you

606
00:30:49,940 --> 00:30:50,590
talk to the producer, too?

607
00:30:50,700 --> 00:30:52,820
-Yes.
-He didn't say anything?

608
00:30:53,040 --> 00:30:56,930
Well, he said that you didn't want to go there.

609
00:30:57,260 --> 00:30:59,140
But I thought,

610
00:30:59,360 --> 00:31:01,580
since we're supposed to be 50/50,

611
00:31:01,810 --> 00:31:04,270
don't I have some say in this, too?

612
00:31:04,370 --> 00:31:09,820
But the producer was afraid if we forced you, you wouldn't show up at the next shooting.

613
00:31:09,820 --> 00:31:10,920
Shut the hell up!

614
00:31:11,260 --> 00:31:12,040
No way!

615
00:31:12,140 --> 00:31:13,590
So I gave up...

616
00:31:13,710 --> 00:31:15,040
No, I wouldn't do that!

617
00:31:15,260 --> 00:31:18,710
I won't want you to be a no-show, so...

618
00:31:19,150 --> 00:31:21,700
We're holding off the noodle house for the future...

619
00:31:22,150 --> 00:31:24,040
Don't worry, we can go there anytime.

620
00:31:24,150 --> 00:31:25,040
Is that right?

621
00:31:25,370 --> 00:31:27,590
Seriously, I pretty much own that place.

622
00:31:29,140 --> 00:31:32,930
-You guys are like family.
-Right.

623
00:31:33,600 --> 00:31:35,580
I will say though...

624
00:31:35,710 --> 00:31:39,930
that beef noodle they serve is like the croquette we had.

625
00:31:40,150 --> 00:31:43,370
They lace their food.

626
00:31:43,470 --> 00:31:44,590
I don't think so!

627
00:31:44,820 --> 00:31:45,920
It must be their seasoning.

628
00:31:46,140 --> 00:31:48,480
Seriously, you'd get hooked on their beef noodles.

629
00:31:48,810 --> 00:31:50,150
It's that good...?

630
00:31:50,600 --> 00:31:52,150
I get it!

631
00:31:52,360 --> 00:31:54,030
Scared me...

632
00:31:54,720 --> 00:31:56,480
I see!

633
00:31:56,940 --> 00:31:58,040
Huh?

634
00:31:58,370 --> 00:31:59,470
Let's see...

635
00:31:59,920 --> 00:32:03,590
"Let's check out Hamada's favorite love hotel"?

636
00:32:04,040 --> 00:32:05,480
Greetings!!

637
00:32:05,480 --> 00:32:06,360
God, it's them!

638
00:32:06,510 --> 00:32:07,810
Good to see you again!

639
00:32:08,150 --> 00:32:10,030
That's CURRY'S!

640
00:32:10,270 --> 00:32:11,270
We're LICENSE!

641
00:32:11,370 --> 00:32:13,030
I thought you've changed the name...

642
00:32:14,150 --> 00:32:15,820
We've made that mistake once before...

643
00:32:17,040 --> 00:32:18,590
We've learned our lesson then...

644
00:32:19,470 --> 00:32:20,590
God, I can smell it here!

645
00:32:20,710 --> 00:32:21,810
The curry smell!

646
00:32:22,040 --> 00:32:23,140
It's very strong...

647
00:32:23,360 --> 00:32:24,710
But this isn't about that.

648
00:32:24,930 --> 00:32:25,710
Then what?

649
00:32:25,930 --> 00:32:27,150
Fujiwara has some...

650
00:32:27,480 --> 00:32:28,370
He'd like your help.

651
00:32:28,370 --> 00:32:29,930
-What?
-I'd like to talk to you.

652
00:32:30,150 --> 00:32:31,820
-May I?
-You're serious?

653
00:32:32,700 --> 00:32:34,710
Can we go somewhere more private?

654
00:32:34,920 --> 00:32:36,830
I know it's gonna be curry!

655
00:32:37,040 --> 00:32:38,930
I know we can smell it but...

656
00:32:40,260 --> 00:32:42,260
This is more about Fujiwara's issue.

657
00:32:42,360 --> 00:32:43,480
-Serious?
-Yes.

658
00:32:43,930 --> 00:32:45,580
Hello. We're from Gobu Gobu TV show.

659
00:32:46,370 --> 00:32:47,490
Excuse us.

660
00:32:47,700 --> 00:32:50,160
This must be something big...

661
00:32:50,370 --> 00:32:51,370
It's a big deal.

662
00:32:51,710 --> 00:32:53,370
Please have a seat.

663
00:32:54,930 --> 00:32:56,810
Okay, let's hear it.

664
00:32:58,810 --> 00:33:01,030
It's rather a severe issue...

665
00:33:01,370 --> 00:33:02,820
And I hope you can help me.

666
00:33:03,030 --> 00:33:06,470
First of all, I have my own blog page.

667
00:33:06,820 --> 00:33:09,040
It's written by me, Fujiwara from LICENSE.

668
00:33:09,140 --> 00:33:14,260
Most of us comedians use Yahoo blog.

669
00:33:14,710 --> 00:33:19,700
And I'm usually ranked between 3rd and 5th every week.

670
00:33:20,150 --> 00:33:21,700
Every blog gets their ranking.

671
00:33:22,040 --> 00:33:23,710
And I've never been ranked the highest.

672
00:33:24,160 --> 00:33:28,810
I'm guessing the top blogger gets so many viewers and comments.

673
00:33:29,040 --> 00:33:31,710
But I want to beat them, if not only for once!

674
00:33:32,150 --> 00:33:33,720
I've been at it for a long time...

675
00:33:34,030 --> 00:33:34,720
Who's No. 1 by the way?

676
00:33:34,930 --> 00:33:36,940
It's your wife, Natsumi.

677
00:33:37,040 --> 00:33:38,150
Huh?

678
00:33:38,370 --> 00:33:39,040
You serious?

679
00:33:39,250 --> 00:33:42,040
Yes, uncontested.

680
00:33:42,140 --> 00:33:45,590
I've used many tactics, but just can't beat her.

681
00:33:45,930 --> 00:33:47,810
Not just me, but many other comedians have tried, too.

682
00:33:48,150 --> 00:33:52,150
Not matter how much effort you put into the blog,

683
00:33:52,370 --> 00:33:53,590
Nobody can knock her out of No. 1 status.

684
00:33:53,940 --> 00:33:55,590
It's impossible.

685
00:33:56,820 --> 00:33:58,920
Did you know about this?

686
00:33:59,040 --> 00:34:00,260
Well, I knew she had a blog but...

687
00:34:00,380 --> 00:34:02,480
didn't realize she's been No. 1 all this time.

688
00:34:02,810 --> 00:34:05,360
So, what I'd like to ask you is...

689
00:34:05,580 --> 00:34:08,480
Could you make a cameo in my blog?

690
00:34:09,700 --> 00:34:11,370
That's it?!

691
00:34:11,590 --> 00:34:13,920
I've seen Hamada-san in Natsumi's blog.

692
00:34:14,160 --> 00:34:16,590
And when he's in, her readership skyrockets.

693
00:34:17,040 --> 00:34:19,260
Yes, she'd blog about our dinner outing and stuff...

694
00:34:19,360 --> 00:34:20,600
She'd post some photos, too.

695
00:34:20,810 --> 00:34:23,030
Only the man of the house can beat her at this point.

696
00:34:23,360 --> 00:34:24,370
I see.

697
00:34:24,820 --> 00:34:26,580
The introduction is important.

698
00:34:26,700 --> 00:34:29,040
I don't want to just introduce you like any other blogger.

699
00:34:29,250 --> 00:34:31,040
Here. I have a tentative caption,

700
00:34:31,590 --> 00:34:33,040
which I'll use on your photo.

701
00:34:33,370 --> 00:34:34,590
I see.

702
00:34:34,830 --> 00:34:36,810
I'd like to know what you think of it...

703
00:34:37,050 --> 00:34:38,930
I hope you're okay with this...

704
00:34:39,480 --> 00:34:41,580
So, his photo will have to match with the caption.

705
00:34:41,820 --> 00:34:45,040
Yes, but I think it'll be fairly easy.

706
00:34:46,040 --> 00:34:51,140
"Greetings to all Fujiwara's blog readers. It's me, Masatoshi."

707
00:34:51,480 --> 00:34:55,260
"Today, I'm here to help make Fujiwara the No. 1 blogger."

708
00:34:55,360 --> 00:34:57,580
"I, Masatoshi, is behind his blog 100%."

709
00:34:57,720 --> 00:34:59,820
"Don't miss Gobu Gobu on May 6th for more details."

710
00:34:59,930 --> 00:35:01,370
"Masatoshi over and out."

711
00:35:01,490 --> 00:35:03,040
What the hell is that?!

712
00:35:03,150 --> 00:35:05,590
Now we just need a photo to match...

713
00:35:05,710 --> 00:35:06,590
That'll get some attention.

714
00:35:06,820 --> 00:35:08,140
I'm moving up for sure.

715
00:35:08,260 --> 00:35:11,260
Public will love how you'd call yourself Masatoshi.

716
00:35:11,810 --> 00:35:14,030
-In the blog world
-Yes, only in the blog.

717
00:35:14,580 --> 00:35:16,820
This is so embarrassing...

718
00:35:17,150 --> 00:35:19,470
Once the show airs, you'll be okay.

719
00:35:20,260 --> 00:35:21,920
But if this doesn't air for some reason,

720
00:35:22,260 --> 00:35:24,260
people will never get this.

721
00:35:24,480 --> 00:35:28,480
But you'll score some interested readers regardless.

722
00:35:28,580 --> 00:35:30,480
Also, because media is always hungry for some news,

723
00:35:30,820 --> 00:35:34,040
until this show airs on May 6th,

724
00:35:34,370 --> 00:35:38,040
the news headline will be
"Masatoshi refers himself in third-person."!

725
00:35:38,160 --> 00:35:39,590
Yahoo news headline?!

726
00:35:39,710 --> 00:35:41,040
So embarrassing...

727
00:35:41,260 --> 00:35:42,360
You better cut it out.

728
00:35:42,590 --> 00:35:44,710
This could also serve as the advertisement.

729
00:35:45,050 --> 00:35:46,580
It's good for Atsushi, too.

730
00:35:46,710 --> 00:35:47,930
Me too?

731
00:35:48,030 --> 00:35:50,590
Because it's essentially for Gobu Gobu.

732
00:35:50,940 --> 00:35:52,250
And I want to win against your wife.

733
00:35:53,250 --> 00:35:56,470
It all depends on how Masatoshi-san feels.

734
00:35:56,710 --> 00:35:59,140
What do you say, Masatoshi-san.

735
00:35:59,480 --> 00:36:02,580
Well, all you want is photo, right?

736
00:36:02,710 --> 00:36:06,250
The photo needs to reflect on your close friendship.

737
00:36:06,370 --> 00:36:08,250
Showing a different side of Hamada-san per se.

738
00:36:08,490 --> 00:36:09,920
It needs to be "Masatoshi."

739
00:36:10,250 --> 00:36:12,590
All "Masatoshi."

740
00:36:12,710 --> 00:36:13,470
"Masatoshi" face.

741
00:36:13,470 --> 00:36:14,710
No place for "Hamada".

742
00:36:15,040 --> 00:36:16,590
Right...

743
00:36:16,930 --> 00:36:18,930
Can't have the usual overpowering Hamada-san.

744
00:36:19,030 --> 00:36:20,930
I want to see a huge smile.

745
00:36:21,150 --> 00:36:22,930
If you would flash a smile...

746
00:36:23,150 --> 00:36:25,370
It'll just be me in it?

747
00:36:25,700 --> 00:36:27,590
As your Masatoshi reference.

748
00:36:28,370 --> 00:36:30,140
Why not both of you?

749
00:36:30,590 --> 00:36:32,140
How about you two in the photo?

750
00:36:32,480 --> 00:36:33,480
Is that okay?

751
00:36:33,590 --> 00:36:35,260
Let me take the photo then.

752
00:36:37,150 --> 00:36:39,580
Atsushi-san, could you help me with the angle?

753
00:36:39,820 --> 00:36:42,040
Is this better?

754
00:36:42,470 --> 00:36:45,920
Mmm, you two look too stiff...

755
00:36:47,480 --> 00:36:48,710
Vertical shot is okay?

756
00:36:49,480 --> 00:36:51,810
Fujiwara needs to put his arm around Hamada-san too.

757
00:36:53,720 --> 00:36:55,700
Please smile, Hamada-san.

758
00:36:57,250 --> 00:36:58,040
That's good.

759
00:36:59,250 --> 00:37:00,470
Smile now.

760
00:37:00,920 --> 00:37:02,590
How's this?

761
00:37:02,710 --> 00:37:04,040
That's pretty good.

762
00:37:04,710 --> 00:37:06,140
Cut it out!!

763
00:37:06,930 --> 00:37:08,050
Ready?

764
00:37:08,260 --> 00:37:09,580
Looking really good.

765
00:37:09,580 --> 00:37:10,820
Here we go.

766
00:37:13,370 --> 00:37:15,250
Thank you very much.

767
00:37:16,370 --> 00:37:19,140
This has to work...!

768
00:37:19,820 --> 00:37:21,830
If I can win over Natsumi-san with this,

769
00:37:22,040 --> 00:37:23,710
what else can I do?

770
00:37:24,050 --> 00:37:26,030
Why are you asking me?!

771
00:37:26,360 --> 00:37:28,370
Don't worry, you got this!

772
00:37:28,480 --> 00:37:30,150
If all else fails, ask Atsushi-san.

773
00:37:30,250 --> 00:37:32,150
Well, me...?

774
00:37:32,370 --> 00:37:34,260
You'll have to ask Atsushi-san too.

775
00:37:34,470 --> 00:37:37,140
Atsushi-san and his two suns.

776
00:37:37,380 --> 00:37:38,590
Yes, I used that phrase at my wedding.

777
00:37:39,040 --> 00:37:40,930
"I'm now blessed with two suns."

778
00:37:41,150 --> 00:37:44,480
Right, each sun represents Ryo and my wife...
My speech, yes.

779
00:37:44,930 --> 00:37:47,590
That's my wedding speech...

780
00:37:47,820 --> 00:37:50,370
Embarrssing? How dare you?

781
00:37:50,590 --> 00:37:52,470
-But you made the speech.
-Yes, I did but...

782
00:37:52,710 --> 00:37:54,830
Why is everyone ganging up on me...?

783
00:37:54,930 --> 00:37:56,140
That was his speech.

784
00:37:56,360 --> 00:37:57,480
I get it. I know.

785
00:37:57,600 --> 00:37:59,150
Oh, thank you.

786
00:37:59,480 --> 00:38:01,580
Wow, that looks so good.

787
00:38:01,820 --> 00:38:03,250
It is delicious.

788
00:38:03,480 --> 00:38:06,370
And the flavor from simmered onion is something else.

789
00:38:06,590 --> 00:38:07,920
Let's dig in.

790
00:38:08,160 --> 00:38:09,040
Please enjoy.

791
00:38:09,370 --> 00:38:12,140
I see the place is called "Gentle Time"?

792
00:38:13,810 --> 00:38:16,150
Cafe Gentle Time.

793
00:38:16,480 --> 00:38:17,820
Thank you for pointing that out.

794
00:38:18,270 --> 00:38:21,940
I'd like to believe the flavor is also "gentle"...

795
00:38:23,370 --> 00:38:27,140
-Let me see if there's any peppers in here...
-There's none.

796
00:38:28,040 --> 00:38:30,810
Wow, it smells amazing...

797
00:38:31,050 --> 00:38:32,030
Yes, I know!

798
00:38:32,360 --> 00:38:35,030
It doesn't have the typical spicy curry smell.

799
00:38:35,580 --> 00:38:36,700
Is that so?

800
00:38:37,030 --> 00:38:39,040
It looks great for sure.

801
00:38:39,370 --> 00:38:40,710
-Looks great
-I'm going for it.

802
00:38:40,920 --> 00:38:43,470
I think we finally found one for you.

803
00:38:45,930 --> 00:38:47,360
-Is this a potato?
-Yes, it is.

804
00:38:47,480 --> 00:38:48,710
What the hell...?

805
00:38:49,260 --> 00:38:51,030
We may have accomplished the task...

806
00:38:51,150 --> 00:38:52,370
Here I go.

807
00:38:54,370 --> 00:38:56,040
It's hot, isn't it?

808
00:39:01,260 --> 00:39:03,480
-How is it?
-Mmm?!

809
00:39:10,120 --> 00:39:10,890
Um?

810
00:39:10,890 --> 00:39:13,220
-Um?
-You okay?

811
00:39:13,770 --> 00:39:16,440
Delicious, wait, it's HOT!!

812
00:39:17,010 --> 00:39:17,890
Shut the hell up.

813
00:39:17,890 --> 00:39:19,330
The spice crept up on you...

814
00:39:19,990 --> 00:39:22,000
Calm down...

815
00:39:22,000 --> 00:39:24,000
-It's really good though
-Isn't it?

816
00:39:24,000 --> 00:39:25,430
Really delicious!

817
00:39:25,430 --> 00:39:28,440
I could've told you that. I mean it looks delicious.

818
00:39:29,670 --> 00:39:31,010
Very spicy...

819
00:39:31,010 --> 00:39:33,670
But I can get into this flavor...

820
00:39:34,230 --> 00:39:36,780
- Tasty
-Yes it is!

821
00:39:37,110 --> 00:39:39,450
-Good
-It's beyond curry, isn't it?

822
00:39:39,450 --> 00:39:41,430
This is no joke. It's good.

823
00:39:41,430 --> 00:39:43,430
-Good, isn't it?
-Yea...

824
00:39:43,430 --> 00:39:45,340
It's easy to get hooked on the flavor.

825
00:39:46,220 --> 00:39:48,320
You're sweating already?

826
00:39:48,890 --> 00:39:53,110
-If this weren't as spicy...
-Then, it wouldn't be a curry.

827
00:39:53,110 --> 00:39:54,450
It'd be the best.

828
00:39:54,450 --> 00:39:55,900
Then, it would be hashed beef rice.

829
00:39:55,900 --> 00:39:57,880
Seriously, this is one good curry.

830
00:39:58,550 --> 00:39:59,550
Good, isn't it?

831
00:39:59,550 --> 00:40:01,340
-It's really good.
-Yes, it is.

832
00:40:01,340 --> 00:40:02,890
You're getting really sweaty...

833
00:40:03,440 --> 00:40:06,110
Once the spice gets me like this,

834
00:40:06,110 --> 00:40:08,440
it makes me not want to try any other curry...

835
00:40:08,890 --> 00:40:10,900
Don't get me wrong.

836
00:40:10,900 --> 00:40:12,660
I love the taste.

837
00:40:12,660 --> 00:40:16,550
So you guy's goal is to find the perfect curry

838
00:40:16,550 --> 00:40:19,440
that he can finish eating, right?

839
00:40:19,440 --> 00:40:22,560
I mean I want to see him clean the plate.

840
00:40:22,560 --> 00:40:25,110
You found this delicious but too spicy, right?

841
00:40:25,110 --> 00:40:28,330
Yes, are you guys really doing your homework before you recommend these?

842
00:40:28,330 --> 00:40:30,330
Of course, we're taking mental notes!

843
00:40:30,550 --> 00:40:31,880
But why am I the only one eating?

844
00:40:32,780 --> 00:40:34,790
Because we tasted them already.

845
00:40:34,790 --> 00:40:38,010
We think we're getting closer to your liking.

846
00:40:38,010 --> 00:40:42,540
I will say that this curry stands above the rest.

847
00:40:42,540 --> 00:40:44,450
You mean, the flavor is the best.

848
00:40:44,450 --> 00:40:47,000
I wish they'd ease up on the spice a little more.

849
00:40:47,000 --> 00:40:49,780
Then, it wouldn't be a curry.

850
00:40:49,780 --> 00:40:52,550
The spice is what makes their curry.

851
00:40:53,220 --> 00:40:56,560
But I believe they could do away with less spice.

852
00:40:56,560 --> 00:40:58,540
-Don't use any spice then?
-Right.

853
00:40:58,540 --> 00:41:00,330
Why do they have to cater to your preference?

854
00:41:00,330 --> 00:41:03,110
And why are you sweating so much?

855
00:41:03,110 --> 00:41:04,670
Cut it out...

856
00:41:04,670 --> 00:41:06,550
Again, it's a good curry.

857
00:41:07,440 --> 00:41:09,000
They need to add more jam in this.

858
00:41:09,000 --> 00:41:10,770
Shut the hell up.

859
00:41:11,890 --> 00:41:14,110
You're making us feel bad.

860
00:41:14,110 --> 00:41:15,230
How can't you not finish this?

861
00:41:15,890 --> 00:41:18,660
-There's no denying it's good.
-You're sweating so much.

862
00:41:18,660 --> 00:41:20,550
You two need to find him another curry.

863
00:41:20,550 --> 00:41:22,330
Yes, we'll research some more.

864
00:41:22,330 --> 00:41:23,780
You're getting close.

865
00:41:23,880 --> 00:41:25,890
Thank you, it'll be even better next time.

866
00:41:25,890 --> 00:41:29,010
So, we're just gonna keep going with this mission?

867
00:41:30,440 --> 00:41:32,540
Huh? Do I want to shower at the love hotel?

868
00:41:32,540 --> 00:41:36,900
You suggest I clean up at the love hotel?

869
00:41:36,900 --> 00:41:38,780
And Hamada-san will be waiting for you outside.

870
00:41:39,220 --> 00:41:40,790
What a terrifying image.

871
00:41:42,100 --> 00:41:45,110
I don't ever want him to tell me to hit the shower.

872
00:41:45,110 --> 00:41:47,990
Only then, your roles will be split 50/50 (gobu gobu).

873
00:41:48,990 --> 00:41:50,660
You just might beat Hamada-san...

874
00:41:50,660 --> 00:41:54,550
-I don't wanna be a cat
You could split it 70/30.

875
00:41:55,120 --> 00:41:59,670
OFF TO HAMADA'S FAVORITE LOVE HOTEL

876
00:42:03,560 --> 00:42:06,540
Huh? I don't remember it being here...

877
00:42:06,990 --> 00:42:09,550
Well, isn't it around here?

878
00:42:10,330 --> 00:42:15,890
So, this area is pretty much taken over by love hotels..

879
00:42:17,670 --> 00:42:21,780
There are tons of love hotels around,

880
00:42:22,110 --> 00:42:24,780
but this one I'm about to show you is my favorite.

881
00:42:26,450 --> 00:42:32,100
Do people usually have their favorites?

882
00:42:33,670 --> 00:42:36,320
I'm curious to know what you think of it.

883
00:42:36,320 --> 00:42:37,990
I'd like to hear your honest opinion on it.

884
00:42:37,990 --> 00:42:41,210
Like you liked my favorite croquette, right?

885
00:42:41,210 --> 00:42:44,120
That was delicious, yes.

886
00:42:44,120 --> 00:42:45,880
But I don't know how to if I can review love hotels...

887
00:42:45,880 --> 00:42:48,340
I'm not that confident.

888
00:42:48,440 --> 00:42:51,010
Well, you'll gonna find out.

889
00:42:51,010 --> 00:42:53,320
I will look the room objectively.

890
00:42:53,320 --> 00:42:56,440
And see if I personally like it.

891
00:42:56,440 --> 00:42:57,900
Or, if you'd consider booking a room there.

892
00:42:58,110 --> 00:43:01,780
I'm not suggesting you go behind your wife or anything.

893
00:43:01,780 --> 00:43:04,890
You're speaking hypothetically...

894
00:43:04,890 --> 00:43:09,010
But it's not like I frequent the love hotel with my wife.

895
00:43:14,780 --> 00:43:18,670
Imagine facing a love hotel from your apartment like that.

896
00:43:19,550 --> 00:43:21,550
Here?

897
00:43:23,000 --> 00:43:26,670
-Can we just walk in?
-Hope you guys got the permission to enter.

898
00:43:26,670 --> 00:43:29,680
"4 hours"?

899
00:43:29,680 --> 00:43:33,000
-Lots of cars here...
-Means people can stay for just four hours?

900
00:43:33,000 --> 00:43:35,000
Not quite clear myself...

901
00:43:35,430 --> 00:43:40,340
Ah! It's been so long since I felt this weird vibe from a love hotel.

902
00:43:42,110 --> 00:43:44,330
Room 505

903
00:43:44,330 --> 00:43:47,780
Press 505

904
00:43:47,780 --> 00:43:49,900
This one?

905
00:43:49,900 --> 00:43:52,670
Wow, look at these gear.

906
00:43:52,670 --> 00:43:56,220
C'mon, let's get to the 5th floor.

907
00:43:56,220 --> 00:43:58,220
This should get us there.

908
00:44:11,550 --> 00:44:13,550
It's been a while...

909
00:44:13,550 --> 00:44:17,540
I remember the room had ping-pong table and whatnot...

910
00:44:18,440 --> 00:44:23,660
So, why do you come to like this room?

911
00:44:23,660 --> 00:44:25,670
Like I said,

912
00:44:25,670 --> 00:44:27,430
I would know once I see it?

913
00:44:27,430 --> 00:44:30,550
I'm saying I'd have enjoyed it if I were younger.

914
00:44:30,550 --> 00:44:31,670
Excuse us.

915
00:44:34,330 --> 00:44:37,440
Ah yes, these flickering lights.

916
00:44:37,550 --> 00:44:38,780
Remember this?

917
00:44:39,550 --> 00:44:41,670
It's set up in the way that nobody would ever know that you've been here.

918
00:44:41,670 --> 00:44:43,120
Here it is.

919
00:44:43,120 --> 00:44:44,100
Huh?

920
00:44:44,100 --> 00:44:46,100
The sign says, "Sakura No Miya Station"?

921
00:44:46,100 --> 00:44:47,100
A station?

922
00:44:50,010 --> 00:44:51,780
Welcome.

923
00:44:51,780 --> 00:44:56,000
Our hotel accepts all major credit cards.

924
00:44:56,000 --> 00:45:00,120
If you're a membership holder.

925
00:45:00,120 --> 00:45:01,890
What's it say? "Don't..."

926
00:45:02,000 --> 00:45:04,670
Don't rush "IN," it says...

927
00:45:07,320 --> 00:45:09,330
It's a safety warning.

928
00:45:09,330 --> 00:45:11,330
They're looking after our penis' safety.

929
00:45:12,450 --> 00:45:14,220
What do you say, Atsushi...

930
00:45:14,220 --> 00:45:16,880
This isn't anything unusual, right?

931
00:45:16,880 --> 00:45:18,550
Well, this room offers that option like nobody's business.

932
00:45:18,550 --> 00:45:21,220
What? They have things like that in the open like this?

933
00:45:21,220 --> 00:45:23,220
-What?
-Time has changed, you know?

934
00:45:23,220 --> 00:45:25,230
That's for massaging...

935
00:45:26,990 --> 00:45:29,210
Come over here, Atsushi.

936
00:45:29,210 --> 00:45:31,220
Sakuranomiya Station...

937
00:45:31,880 --> 00:45:35,340
It's all about the Sakuranomiya around here.

938
00:45:35,340 --> 00:45:36,670
I see...

939
00:45:46,110 --> 00:45:47,110
Amazing!!

940
00:45:47,780 --> 00:45:49,000
Isn't it?

941
00:45:49,000 --> 00:45:50,890
There's more.

942
00:45:55,890 --> 00:45:57,110
Check out the flooring.

943
00:46:06,880 --> 00:46:10,000
What are they suggesting here?

944
00:46:10,000 --> 00:46:12,010
I was cool with croquette but...

945
00:46:12,010 --> 00:46:14,780
What am I doing in this theme-driven love hotel?

946
00:46:14,780 --> 00:46:16,890
Isn't this amazing?

947
00:46:18,330 --> 00:46:20,210
Looks like a fun place though...

948
00:46:20,210 --> 00:46:23,880
I could only imagine...

949
00:46:24,440 --> 00:46:25,890
They've made a train replica.

950
00:46:26,890 --> 00:46:27,550
Huh?

951
00:46:27,550 --> 00:46:30,560
Multi-functioning toilet?

952
00:46:30,770 --> 00:46:32,990
I see they're on top of each other...

953
00:46:39,330 --> 00:46:41,890
I don't get it.

954
00:46:42,550 --> 00:46:44,220
You haven't seen one of these?

955
00:46:44,220 --> 00:46:46,220
-No.
-Don't know what this is good for?

956
00:46:46,220 --> 00:46:47,890
Well, that's alright..

957
00:46:48,330 --> 00:46:50,230
But you get the idea...

958
00:46:50,230 --> 00:46:51,660
Well, how does this...

959
00:46:51,660 --> 00:46:54,000
I see, you get to tie your hands up there.

960
00:46:55,220 --> 00:46:57,330
Really, no need for you to be an example.

961
00:46:58,220 --> 00:47:01,220
I don't need the picture, really.

962
00:47:02,220 --> 00:47:04,220
Are you into that kind of stuff?

963
00:47:04,220 --> 00:47:05,990
Get out of here.

964
00:47:06,540 --> 00:47:08,900
I was just trying to show you.

965
00:47:08,900 --> 00:47:11,120
-So you're saying you wouldn't be tied up.
-Of course.

966
00:47:11,670 --> 00:47:12,780
What a relief.

967
00:47:12,780 --> 00:47:15,670
But you looked so happy being tied up.

968
00:47:16,420 --> 00:47:18,920
Alright, let's go this way.

969
00:47:19,890 --> 00:47:22,780
It's supposed to be "Tenma".

970
00:47:23,330 --> 00:47:24,780
But they changed it to "Denma"

971
00:47:25,210 --> 00:47:27,780
Whomever created it must be a super pervert.

972
00:47:29,780 --> 00:47:31,790
Um? What's this?

973
00:47:32,550 --> 00:47:34,770
"Call front desk and ask for the ending theme song"

974
00:47:34,770 --> 00:47:36,220
Oh, we're already done here?

975
00:47:36,220 --> 00:47:37,890
This is the end?

976
00:47:40,890 --> 00:47:43,210
"Osaka Kancho Line"

977
00:47:43,210 --> 00:47:46,220
I see, it's supposed to be "Kanjo" and not "Kancho".

978
00:47:46,220 --> 00:47:49,670
I'd say this was a distasteful segue from curry episode.

979
00:47:49,670 --> 00:47:51,670
You have a point.

980
00:47:51,670 --> 00:47:54,220
Is that it?

981
00:47:54,220 --> 00:47:56,330
Atsushi, will you make a call?

982
00:47:56,330 --> 00:47:58,900
And ask for their favorite song.

983
00:47:58,900 --> 00:48:01,330
Front desk is nine...

984
00:48:08,770 --> 00:48:12,230
Excuse me....um...

985
00:48:12,780 --> 00:48:14,660
I would like to ask for your favorite song...

986
00:48:14,900 --> 00:48:16,900
Does that make sense?

987
00:48:16,900 --> 00:48:21,790
I'm sorry if I'm not making any sense...

988
00:48:22,220 --> 00:48:25,770
"Osaka Rhapsody" by Senri and Mari

989
00:48:25,770 --> 00:48:27,320
Ah, I see!

990
00:48:28,230 --> 00:48:29,680
I got it!

991
00:48:29,680 --> 00:48:31,110
Hamada-san is familiar with that song.

992
00:48:31,110 --> 00:48:33,110
But it doesn't really ring a bell for me.

993
00:48:34,210 --> 00:48:37,000
Thank you for the request.

994
00:48:37,000 --> 00:48:38,220
I get it.

995
00:48:38,220 --> 00:48:39,440
Take care, bye.

996
00:48:39,440 --> 00:48:41,440
It makes perfect sense.
