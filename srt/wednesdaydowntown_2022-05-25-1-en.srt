1
00:00:02,580 --> 00:00:05,500
Welcome to Wednesday Downtown

2
00:00:07,200 --> 00:00:10,400
Letâ€™s get on with our first presenter please

3
00:00:10,770 --> 00:00:11,770
Who?

4
00:00:15,470 --> 00:00:18,520
I'm here
-Jinai Tomonori!

5
00:00:18,530 --> 00:00:21,530
I am Jinnai, thanks for having me

6
00:00:21,540 --> 00:00:23,600
Today I bring this theory

7
00:00:24,530 --> 00:00:32,040
The 2nd " Verify that comedians' ranking increases the closer to their hometown"

8
00:00:33,030 --> 00:00:38,090
The second time, last time was Kaminari

9
00:00:38,090 --> 00:00:41,650
They ranked 42nd in national popularity

10
00:00:41,650 --> 00:00:49,150
Then the survey area was narrowed down to Ibaraki Prefecture and Tamada

11
00:00:49,150 --> 00:00:51,360
And also 1046

12
00:00:52,770 --> 00:00:56,390
The results showed that in Ibaraki Prefecture they were in 4th place

13
00:00:56,390 --> 00:01:00,180
And 1st in their city of Hokota
-It's the same as the hypothesis

14
00:01:00,180 --> 00:01:04,380
So, this time we interviewed about 2,000 people

15
00:01:04,380 --> 00:01:09,180
And compiled a national version of favorite comedians
-Got it

16
00:01:09,180 --> 00:01:11,020
Here's the top 10

17
00:01:12,600 --> 00:01:14,560
Impressive, right?

18
00:01:15,410 --> 00:01:19,070
Sandwichman is clearly first, right?

19
00:01:19,070 --> 00:01:21,220
Must feel good

20
00:01:21,900 --> 00:01:23,730
Both of them have cheated on each other

21
00:01:23,730 --> 00:01:25,560
Yes, these two people have cheated on each other

22
00:01:25,570 --> 00:01:27,940
Never heard such a thing

23
00:01:27,940 --> 00:01:29,010
Weird

24
00:01:45,530 --> 00:01:48,220
So, the first group is

25
00:01:48,230 --> 00:01:50,860
Thank you for having us

26
00:01:51,470 --> 00:01:54,490
Saga Prefecture's DobuRock

27
00:01:55,360 --> 00:01:57,060
Not like Saga people

28
00:01:55,530 --> 00:01:57,860
The two of us are childhood friends

29
00:01:58,200 --> 00:02:06,040
Kindergarten, elementary school, middle school, high school, and college all together

30
00:02:05,230 --> 00:02:06,730
Never separated

31
00:02:06,690 --> 00:02:11,500
These two people have been together since the start

32
00:02:12,360 --> 00:02:18,640
We lived in Kokura, Kiyama-cho, Miyaki-gun, Saga Prefecture

33
00:02:18,640 --> 00:02:21,650
The area codes are different
-Yes

34
00:02:22,050 --> 00:02:25,320
Then which area will you choose to investigate?

35
00:02:25,320 --> 00:02:28,090
Yes, which to choose?
-Definitely yours

36
00:02:28,090 --> 00:02:29,390
Mine?

37
00:02:29,950 --> 00:02:36,940
The scope of this survey is gradually reduced as shown in the figure

38
00:02:35,760 --> 00:02:38,760
There are not many comedians from Saga, right?

39
00:02:36,940 --> 00:02:40,090
To verify where they are number one

40
00:02:41,340 --> 00:02:46,680
Your place in the national ranking is 86th

41
00:02:46,680 --> 00:02:48,750
86th, so low

42
00:02:52,220 --> 00:02:55,050
I can't argue with that.
-Yeah

43
00:02:55,050 --> 00:03:03,500
I hope to get more votes than other entertainers from Saga Prefecture

44
00:03:03,600 --> 00:03:06,130
First of all, we have to defeat Hanawa

45
00:03:06,860 --> 00:03:09,170
So... a few days later

46
00:03:08,240 --> 00:03:11,450
Hanawa is not very active in Saga

47
00:03:10,270 --> 00:03:14,150
We approached DobuRock again to inform them of the findings

48
00:03:15,140 --> 00:03:18,410
The ranking of Saga Prefecture

49
00:03:19,060 --> 00:03:24,310
First, we conducted a survey of 20 municipalities in Saga Prefecture

50
00:03:21,920 --> 00:03:24,800
Better here is the first
-Right

51
00:03:25,850 --> 00:03:28,250
10th

52
00:03:28,250 --> 00:03:34,030
On Youtube, he makes a special effort to introduce Saga Prefecture food and so on

53
00:03:34,030 --> 00:03:36,930
I really like his efforts in this area

54
00:03:37,300 --> 00:03:39,330
He always comes to the summer festival

55
00:03:39,330 --> 00:03:43,840
His hosting left a deep impression on me

56
00:03:44,070 --> 00:03:45,500
Hanawa

57
00:03:45,840 --> 00:03:47,090
10th

58
00:03:47,900 --> 00:03:49,890
Speaking of Saga Prefecture, we must mention him

59
00:03:49,890 --> 00:03:52,960
After scoring a hit with "Saga Prefecture" in 2003

60
00:03:52,960 --> 00:03:55,520
He's still popular in the local area

61
00:03:56,380 --> 00:04:00,020
6th to 8th are shown above

62
00:04:00,020 --> 00:04:04,130
The Hanawa Family's 3rd Son is also firmly in 8th place

63
00:04:04,130 --> 00:04:08,170
Can DobuRock crack the top 5?

64
00:04:08,170 --> 00:04:10,480
Next, in 5th

65
00:04:10,960 --> 00:04:12,930
Interesting, just interesting

66
00:04:12,930 --> 00:04:15,900
IKKO's imitation

67
00:04:19,170 --> 00:04:21,240
We like Choco

68
00:04:21,240 --> 00:04:23,410
Chocolate
-Chocolate

69
00:04:24,270 --> 00:04:27,210
5th is Chocolate Planet

70
00:04:27,790 --> 00:04:30,380
Next in 4th

71
00:04:30,480 --> 00:04:35,550
They're work is very impulsive, and I like the feeling of fear and trepidation

72
00:04:35,550 --> 00:04:39,760
They're Saga, the pride of Saga people

73
00:04:39,960 --> 00:04:42,590
They do dirty jokes

74
00:04:42,890 --> 00:04:44,760
I think dirty jokes are fun

75
00:04:45,260 --> 00:04:46,200
DobuRock

76
00:04:46,400 --> 00:04:47,970
It has to be DobuRock

77
00:04:48,170 --> 00:04:49,730
They're awesome

78
00:04:49,900 --> 00:04:52,400
I've already forgotten about DobuRock

79
00:04:52,400 --> 00:04:54,510
Why?

80
00:04:55,130 --> 00:04:58,340
DobuRock is 4th

81
00:05:00,150 --> 00:05:02,510
Higher than expected

82
00:05:02,510 --> 00:05:06,280
We are only ranked 86th in the country

83
00:05:06,810 --> 00:05:15,260
Every year at the festival, the two of them shout "everyone together"

84
00:05:15,260 --> 00:05:21,470
Men and women, young and old, all come together

85
00:05:21,870 --> 00:05:27,790
Their dirty jokes have the support of all-age residents of the old Saga family

86
00:05:27,790 --> 00:05:32,140
They've successfully jumped from 86th to 4th place

87
00:05:32,140 --> 00:05:33,680
Although not in the top 10

88
00:05:33,680 --> 00:05:36,920
Egashira 2:50 was in 11th

89
00:05:36,920 --> 00:05:38,420
We beat Egashira!?
-Indeed

90
00:05:38,420 --> 00:05:40,890
Local comedians all have the love
-Love!

91
00:05:40,890 --> 00:05:43,490
We all have the same love from the place
-I'm so happy

92
00:05:43,490 --> 00:05:45,560
This is a pleasing result

93
00:05:46,050 --> 00:05:50,850
The ranking of comedians that are from Saga Prefecture in the area is shown in the picture

94
00:05:49,850 --> 00:05:51,870
Who's first?

95
00:05:50,840 --> 00:05:55,470
By the way, Orakio and Cherry Yoshitake both have 0 votes

96
00:05:55,600 --> 00:05:58,470
So redundant

97
00:05:59,130 --> 00:06:03,260
So, we narrowed the scope even further

98
00:06:01,670 --> 00:06:03,090
Can they be first?

99
00:06:03,740 --> 00:06:05,750
Possible

100
00:06:04,530 --> 00:06:09,360
An investigation was conducted in Miyaki-gun, Saga Prefecture, which has a population of about 50,000

101
00:06:11,320 --> 00:06:13,680
5th and up is shown above

102
00:06:14,750 --> 00:06:20,330
DobuRock is 4th in Saga Prefecture, will they be 4th here?

103
00:06:20,460 --> 00:06:23,930
Whatever program they're on they are funny

104
00:06:24,230 --> 00:06:25,930
Downtown

105
00:06:25,930 --> 00:06:28,600
I like Matsumoto, but I like Hamada the most

106
00:06:28,550 --> 00:06:30,000
Thats fine

107
00:06:28,600 --> 00:06:30,540
My first choice will always be Hamada

108
00:06:30,920 --> 00:06:33,470
This is not necessary, no need to emphasize

109
00:06:33,970 --> 00:06:35,970
Why are people still being asked this?

110
00:06:36,520 --> 00:06:39,480
Next in 3rd place

111
00:06:39,840 --> 00:06:43,150
Interesting, the way they get along is interesting

112
00:06:43,520 --> 00:06:46,320
And their dirty jokes are funny

113
00:06:46,320 --> 00:06:50,320
A little awkward to watch with the family

114
00:06:50,690 --> 00:06:51,920
Balls and stuff

115
00:06:53,120 --> 00:06:54,460
DobuRock

116
00:06:55,220 --> 00:07:00,780
And so, DobuRock is up 1 spot to #3 in Miyaki-gun

117
00:06:57,270 --> 00:06:58,140
Slowly rising

118
00:06:58,140 --> 00:07:00,220
A little improvement

119
00:07:03,170 --> 00:07:05,840
Higher than Downtown!?

120
00:07:05,840 --> 00:07:08,170
I can't believe we passed Downtown

121
00:07:07,080 --> 00:07:08,550
As expected of their home

122
00:07:08,170 --> 00:07:11,110
It's really a pleasure to see this

123
00:07:11,110 --> 00:07:13,140
Yes, wow

124
00:07:13,720 --> 00:07:17,340
The top two are shown in the chart

125
00:07:16,850 --> 00:07:18,350
Strong

126
00:07:17,350 --> 00:07:23,430
Although they are not in first place, it is still within reach

127
00:07:23,430 --> 00:07:24,430
Yeah

128
00:07:24,670 --> 00:07:32,510
Next is the area with a population of about 17,000 people, where DobuRock are local ambassadors

129
00:07:25,330 --> 00:07:28,220
Almost there
-Yeah

130
00:07:32,510 --> 00:07:35,500
Kiyama-cho, Miyaki-gun, Saga Prefecture

131
00:07:36,220 --> 00:07:37,550
So

132
00:07:37,540 --> 00:07:42,370
I am good friends with Eguchi's sister

133
00:07:42,370 --> 00:07:45,140
I've been supporting them since their debut

134
00:07:45,310 --> 00:07:49,980
DobuRock is my husband's junior, my senior

135
00:07:50,320 --> 00:07:53,380
Since childhood, DobuRock and I grew up and played together

136
00:07:53,380 --> 00:07:57,490
I've been watching their Youtube and TV shows

137
00:07:58,070 --> 00:08:04,480
After the survey was narrowed down to the town, it appeared that many people knew DobuRock directly

138
00:08:05,460 --> 00:08:11,170
So, the No.1 favorite comedian in Kiyama-cho is

139
00:08:11,170 --> 00:08:12,600
Which comedian do you like?

140
00:08:12,600 --> 00:08:13,870
DobuRock

141
00:08:13,870 --> 00:08:17,710
They're my dad's friends.
-They are?

142
00:08:17,710 --> 00:08:19,780
Which comedian do you like most?

143
00:08:19,780 --> 00:08:22,150
Of course from Kiyama

144
00:08:22,150 --> 00:08:23,480
DobuRock

145
00:08:24,270 --> 00:08:27,700
DobuRock's roots are surprisingly stable

146
00:08:27,700 --> 00:08:31,870
As they pulled almost triple the amount of votes of Downtown to secure 1st place

147
00:08:32,260 --> 00:08:34,660
Yeah!
-Wow, that's great

148
00:08:34,660 --> 00:08:36,330
Happy
-So great!

149
00:08:36,330 --> 00:08:40,800
They and my youngest son are classmates from elementary school

150
00:08:40,800 --> 00:08:44,600
Has an especial good relationship with Eguchi

151
00:08:44,600 --> 00:08:46,840
Watching them on TV

152
00:08:46,840 --> 00:08:51,310
We were so excited when they won a contest we shouted hooray!

153
00:08:51,310 --> 00:08:54,350
There's was the best sketch i've ever seen

154
00:08:54,350 --> 00:08:55,480
We are classmates

155
00:08:55,480 --> 00:08:57,480
You know them?
-That's right.

156
00:08:57,480 --> 00:08:59,680
We have been together from elementary school to college

157
00:08:59,680 --> 00:09:02,920
At that time did they do dirty jokes?
-Not at all

158
00:09:02,920 --> 00:09:05,220
Eguchi always did a lot

159
00:09:05,220 --> 00:09:07,190
Mori was also very serious

160
00:09:07,430 --> 00:09:12,830
We rarely hear friends and family say they like us

161
00:09:12,830 --> 00:09:15,570
So I was quite nervous initially

162
00:09:15,570 --> 00:09:20,370
I guess I'll have to give out a lot of autographs

163
00:09:20,370 --> 00:09:22,740
At least 10

164
00:09:23,540 --> 00:09:25,680
The second group is

165
00:09:25,680 --> 00:09:28,260
Good morning
-Hello

166
00:09:28,910 --> 00:09:31,450
59th in the country

167
00:09:31,450 --> 00:09:36,030
Tochigi Prefecture's Ujikoji

168
00:09:33,200 --> 00:09:36,510
Best in Tochigi at least
-That's right

169
00:09:36,620 --> 00:09:38,860
We are popular there

170
00:09:38,860 --> 00:09:41,260
But we... No. 1 is a little tough

171
00:09:41,260 --> 00:09:45,360
Strength...
-Not very stable

172
00:09:45,730 --> 00:09:48,300
Where did you two meet?
-High School

173
00:09:48,530 --> 00:09:50,070
I'm from Otawara

174
00:09:50,300 --> 00:09:51,940
I am in Nasu-Shiobara City

175
00:09:51,730 --> 00:09:52,540
What's wrong with your neck?

176
00:09:52,200 --> 00:09:54,210
Whose hometown will we investigate this time?

177
00:09:54,200 --> 00:09:55,980
Do you care?

178
00:09:54,210 --> 00:09:56,670
We often go to Nasu-Shiobara for events

179
00:09:56,980 --> 00:10:00,180
Indeed, there are more performances in my hometown

180
00:10:00,180 --> 00:10:02,050
Nasu-Shiobara has a better chance of winning!

181
00:10:02,660 --> 00:10:10,250
So, this time, we narrowed the scope from the prefecture to Fukuda's hometown and surveyed them in turn.

182
00:10:08,320 --> 00:10:10,700
First in Tochigi, right?

183
00:10:10,250 --> 00:10:13,500
And so the verification to see if they can reach the topspot begins

184
00:10:14,530 --> 00:10:16,830
Wow

185
00:10:16,830 --> 00:10:18,760
These people are all really funny

186
00:10:19,360 --> 00:10:23,840
We are still so far away

187
00:10:24,190 --> 00:10:27,240
What?
-Its not like that

188
00:10:27,890 --> 00:10:29,580
Good morning
-Good morning

189
00:10:29,570 --> 00:10:32,180
These are the county rankings

190
00:10:32,180 --> 00:10:35,080
County is tough

191
00:10:34,470 --> 00:10:35,970
No problem

192
00:10:35,650 --> 00:10:43,480
Tochigi residents favorite comedians 10th to 4th are as above

193
00:10:43,480 --> 00:10:46,630
They are in the top 10

194
00:10:47,510 --> 00:10:53,420
But where are Tochigi's future ambassadors in the top 3?

195
00:10:53,420 --> 00:10:55,770
3rd

196
00:10:55,770 --> 00:10:57,740
What attracts me?

197
00:10:57,740 --> 00:11:00,100
I like the way they use their dialect

198
00:11:00,100 --> 00:11:03,140
Dresses like a gangster

199
00:11:03,570 --> 00:11:05,140
Sushi Ni-gan

200
00:11:05,140 --> 00:11:07,150
I really like Chidori

201
00:11:07,830 --> 00:11:10,110
Chidori are 3rd

202
00:11:12,310 --> 00:11:15,250
Next in 2nd

203
00:11:15,250 --> 00:11:18,760
Hometown characteristics

204
00:11:18,760 --> 00:11:20,860
The style is very warm

205
00:11:21,130 --> 00:11:24,060
Everyone has passed away

206
00:11:24,060 --> 00:11:25,430
What are you referring to?

207
00:11:25,430 --> 00:11:29,770
For example, Yasushi and Eigaku

208
00:11:29,770 --> 00:11:34,140
Ujikoji is a bit further down the list

209
00:11:33,380 --> 00:11:35,360
This sorting is awesome

210
00:11:34,140 --> 00:11:36,140
I'm sorry. I'm sorry

211
00:11:36,140 --> 00:11:39,210
What a long list of comedians!

212
00:11:39,210 --> 00:11:42,550
Tochigi Prefecture is very special

213
00:11:42,650 --> 00:11:43,920
Ujikoji

214
00:11:44,220 --> 00:11:45,850
Ujikoji

215
00:11:46,540 --> 00:11:49,270
Not surprisingly, Ujikoji's work enjoys high popularity in their hometown

216
00:11:49,270 --> 00:11:55,060
Loved by the elderly, they rank 2nd

217
00:11:57,200 --> 00:11:59,860
But 2nd...

218
00:11:59,860 --> 00:12:01,800
That's very satisfying

219
00:12:02,400 --> 00:12:04,000
Who's in 1st place?

220
00:12:04,010 --> 00:12:08,510
The first is Sandwichman
-Sandwichman!

221
00:12:09,510 --> 00:12:15,980
Its like prefectural high school and the top four has made it to the Koshien

222
00:12:16,640 --> 00:12:20,770
Next, we survey in Nasu-Shiobara City

223
00:12:22,610 --> 00:12:25,620
10th to 3rd are as shown

224
00:12:27,660 --> 00:12:31,590
Can Ujikoji reach 1st place?

225
00:12:32,400 --> 00:12:35,030
2nd is...

226
00:12:35,370 --> 00:12:40,540
The clothing and their topics are interesting

227
00:12:40,740 --> 00:12:43,540
Their lines are funny

228
00:12:43,540 --> 00:12:47,040
Funny look

229
00:12:47,180 --> 00:12:48,880
I like Sandwichman

230
00:12:48,940 --> 00:12:50,690
That means

231
00:12:49,500 --> 00:12:51,770
2nd is Sandwichman

232
00:12:50,680 --> 00:12:52,430
They're 2nd

233
00:12:52,320 --> 00:12:55,490
So, 1st is...

234
00:12:55,720 --> 00:12:57,520
Because they're local

235
00:12:57,520 --> 00:12:59,160
Ujikoji

236
00:12:59,290 --> 00:13:00,560
Ujikoji

237
00:13:00,730 --> 00:13:01,990
Ujikoji

238
00:13:01,990 --> 00:13:04,060
Treasures of the north

239
00:13:04,620 --> 00:13:10,170
And so, Ujikoki get 1st place in Nasu-Shiobara

240
00:13:10,870 --> 00:13:12,500
Thank you!

241
00:13:12,500 --> 00:13:13,470
That's great!

242
00:13:13,470 --> 00:13:15,270
So close, so close

243
00:13:15,510 --> 00:13:18,910
Oh, Kaminari's on the list.
-Yeah, came out of nowhere

244
00:13:18,910 --> 00:13:21,580
They have their own program in Tochigi on Tochigi TV

245
00:13:21,580 --> 00:13:22,550
That must be the reason

246
00:13:22,550 --> 00:13:24,580
Don't want to lose them?

247
00:13:24,580 --> 00:13:29,420
They have their strengths

248
00:13:29,420 --> 00:13:32,160
But they're not to everyone's tastes

249
00:13:32,940 --> 00:13:35,010
And finally, this guy

250
00:13:35,010 --> 00:13:36,230
Hello everyone

251
00:13:36,690 --> 00:13:42,390
39th in the country, Kano Eiko of Miyagi Prefecture

252
00:13:38,310 --> 00:13:42,970
Sandwichman are also from Miyagi
-Yes

253
00:13:42,670 --> 00:13:55,910
106, Sanjin-shita Sakuraga, Kurikoma, Kurihara, Miyagi Prefecture

254
00:13:54,600 --> 00:13:55,910
Said it all

255
00:13:56,680 --> 00:14:01,620
The division of Kano's hometown address is above

256
00:14:01,640 --> 00:14:05,280
We conducted a survey in these 3 areas

257
00:14:05,560 --> 00:14:07,630
My hometown is a shrine area

258
00:14:07,630 --> 00:14:10,190
Festivals and New Year's Eve and other times

259
00:14:10,190 --> 00:14:14,070
I go home to work then leave

260
00:14:14,070 --> 00:14:20,200
I return home to work for the shrine and contribute to the local community

261
00:14:21,140 --> 00:14:24,810
However, in Miyagi Prefecture

262
00:14:24,810 --> 00:14:27,380
There's also Sandwichman

263
00:14:27,930 --> 00:14:33,190
That's right, Miyagi Prefecture is the domain of the kings, Sandwichman

264
00:14:33,780 --> 00:14:36,590
A tough opponent!

265
00:14:37,170 --> 00:14:42,660
How close to home does Kano have to be to become No. 1?

266
00:14:43,690 --> 00:14:44,760
First, Miyagi Prefecture

267
00:14:45,100 --> 00:14:47,160
I think i'll be in the top 3

268
00:14:47,710 --> 00:14:53,830
The first is the ranking of favorite comedians in the 35 cities, towns and villages of Miyagi Prefecture

269
00:14:55,280 --> 00:14:58,070
10th to 6th are shown above

270
00:14:56,840 --> 00:14:59,700
NON STYLE's always there
-Awesome

271
00:14:59,340 --> 00:15:01,810
In fifth...

272
00:15:01,980 --> 00:15:05,580
I've been watching his game channel on Youtube, its good

273
00:15:05,580 --> 00:15:08,590
His sense of nonsense is good
-That's right, that's right

274
00:15:08,690 --> 00:15:10,920
Ramen noodles, dipping noodles, Ichi noodles

275
00:15:11,020 --> 00:15:12,590
Kano Eiko

276
00:15:12,890 --> 00:15:14,560
Kano Eitaka

277
00:15:14,290 --> 00:15:16,320
He made the list

278
00:15:15,270 --> 00:15:21,750
And so, Kano Eiko jumps from 39th to 5th place in the prefecture

279
00:15:22,300 --> 00:15:24,840
5th? Really, 5th?

280
00:15:24,840 --> 00:15:27,570
There's still some hope left

281
00:15:28,220 --> 00:15:32,010
Above Kato are these comedians

282
00:15:32,010 --> 00:15:35,220
Sandwichman has 306 votes

283
00:15:32,760 --> 00:15:36,750
Sandwichman 306 votes, 2nd is Chidori with 49 votes

284
00:15:37,110 --> 00:15:40,790
Sandwichman is such a tough hurdle to overcome

285
00:15:55,120 --> 00:16:00,450
How close to home does Kano Eiko have to be to be number 1 on the list of favorite comedians?

286
00:16:01,100 --> 00:16:06,950
Next, a survey was conducted in Kurihara City, Miyagi Prefecture, with a population of about 64,000 people

287
00:16:07,750 --> 00:16:10,360
10th to 3rd are above

288
00:16:11,210 --> 00:16:17,720
And in 2nd with an overwhelming number of votes...

289
00:16:18,120 --> 00:16:20,960
His words and responses are fun

290
00:16:20,960 --> 00:16:22,590
I like his eyes

291
00:16:22,590 --> 00:16:26,160
I support him because he is a local comedian

292
00:16:26,160 --> 00:16:28,330
Kurihara City's

293
00:16:28,330 --> 00:16:29,700
Kano Eitaka

294
00:16:29,700 --> 00:16:32,270
The only comedian who lives in Kurihara is Kano Eiko

295
00:16:31,530 --> 00:16:33,270
Only 2nd though?

296
00:16:32,900 --> 00:16:34,970
1st is those two, right?

297
00:16:34,970 --> 00:16:36,540
1st is Sandwichman with 132 votes

298
00:16:39,310 --> 00:16:40,910
Close, close

299
00:16:40,910 --> 00:16:42,780
Getting closer to #1

300
00:16:43,450 --> 00:16:53,890
The next level is Kurikoma, Kurihara City, Miyagi Prefecture, which has a population of about 10,000

301
00:16:54,950 --> 00:16:59,550
10th to 4th is shown above

302
00:17:00,750 --> 00:17:07,200
The 1st and 2nd place finishers have a huge gap in comparison to others with overwhelming votes

303
00:17:07,200 --> 00:17:09,770
Yes, that is to say that our Kurihara's

304
00:17:09,770 --> 00:17:11,480
Kano EIKO

305
00:17:11,480 --> 00:17:14,180
Kano Eiko is my classmate

306
00:17:14,180 --> 00:17:15,310
But I don't like him

307
00:17:15,310 --> 00:17:16,880
I like Sandwichman

308
00:17:17,540 --> 00:17:21,850
As expected, the fight is between Sandwichman and Kano Eiko

309
00:17:22,490 --> 00:17:24,120
He is a hometown hero

310
00:17:24,290 --> 00:17:25,460
Kano Eitaka

311
00:17:25,460 --> 00:17:27,690
They've done a lot for Miyagi Prefecture

312
00:17:27,690 --> 00:17:29,690
Sandwichman

313
00:17:30,730 --> 00:17:32,200
Kano Eitaka

314
00:17:32,200 --> 00:17:34,430
We are cousins

315
00:17:34,570 --> 00:17:37,800
What was Kano-san like when he was in school?

316
00:17:37,800 --> 00:17:40,000
I think...

317
00:17:40,000 --> 00:17:42,070
How should I put it

318
00:17:42,070 --> 00:17:44,440
The type that would be bullied

319
00:17:44,440 --> 00:17:48,850
I heard that he fainted after being beaten up

320
00:17:49,240 --> 00:17:54,580
So, the top two in Kurihara are...

321
00:17:56,790 --> 00:18:00,790
Seriously, can Sandwichman take a break?

322
00:18:00,960 --> 00:18:02,460
Still no?

323
00:18:01,300 --> 00:18:04,730
So, we narrowed our investigation again

324
00:18:04,730 --> 00:18:10,750
Finally, we arrived at Kurikoma Sakurada in Kurihara City with a population of about 400 people

325
00:18:06,330 --> 00:18:08,260
That's about right

326
00:18:10,040 --> 00:18:12,200
Only 409 people
-Real hometown vibes now

327
00:18:12,370 --> 00:18:13,840
The range is much smaller

328
00:18:13,840 --> 00:18:15,440
Is it small?

329
00:18:15,440 --> 00:18:21,050
The "Kano Family", our shrine is authentic

330
00:18:21,350 --> 00:18:26,280
And there are many people with the surname Kano in the Sakurada area

331
00:18:26,280 --> 00:18:28,650
I have a lot of people in my family

332
00:18:28,650 --> 00:18:30,390
They are all relatives

333
00:18:30,390 --> 00:18:35,290
If i'm not first this time... they're nothing to me anymore

334
00:18:35,430 --> 00:18:37,830
Do you know each other?

335
00:18:37,830 --> 00:18:39,130
Yeah

336
00:18:39,130 --> 00:18:43,400
I still have tapes of him singing at home

337
00:18:43,400 --> 00:18:46,840
The lyrics are all love-themed

338
00:18:46,840 --> 00:18:50,570
When I look at it I get embarrassed so I close the box.

339
00:18:51,280 --> 00:18:54,150
We're surveying the neighborhood about which comedians the locals like

340
00:18:54,150 --> 00:18:55,810
Only Kano Eiko

341
00:18:56,540 --> 00:19:03,520
And so, the top for Sakurada residents is...

342
00:19:03,520 --> 00:19:07,990
Shoveling snow at the shrines and junior high school

343
00:19:07,990 --> 00:19:14,100
Shoveling snow while chatting with us, I liked it

344
00:19:14,300 --> 00:19:15,430
Sandwichman

345
00:19:17,280 --> 00:19:19,840
But you were talking about the shrine!?

346
00:19:20,240 --> 00:19:26,680
So, even this close to his home with just 400 people, the unbeatable kings still hold the throne

347
00:19:26,890 --> 00:19:29,340
Double the score

348
00:19:26,910 --> 00:19:29,880
No, really?
-Really

349
00:19:30,110 --> 00:19:32,880
Wait wait

350
00:19:31,270 --> 00:19:32,550
Take a breather

351
00:19:32,880 --> 00:19:35,820
No kidding?
-No kidding

352
00:19:35,080 --> 00:19:36,560
A big blow

353
00:19:35,820 --> 00:19:37,490
The votes, what is the number of votes

354
00:19:37,790 --> 00:19:38,930
Starting with me

355
00:19:38,930 --> 00:19:41,250
21
-Okay, and Sandwichman?

356
00:19:41,250 --> 00:19:42,030
43

357
00:19:42,030 --> 00:19:45,130
It's double!

358
00:19:45,600 --> 00:19:49,030
Why didn't you choose Kano?
-Why...

359
00:19:49,030 --> 00:19:52,770
Sandwichman chatted with us like normal people

360
00:19:52,770 --> 00:19:56,040
But Kano doesn't care about us

361
00:19:56,040 --> 00:19:59,340
He is completely different from TV in real life

362
00:19:59,880 --> 00:20:01,480
I remember this

363
00:20:01,480 --> 00:20:04,450
Date was there

364
00:20:04,450 --> 00:20:11,320
And he came with snapper and other gifts for the young junior high school students

365
00:20:10,790 --> 00:20:12,290
What's to dislike?

366
00:20:11,320 --> 00:20:15,260
Buying peoples' hearts with stuff is just despicable

367
00:20:15,950 --> 00:20:19,080
So, the investigation was further narrowed down

368
00:20:19,080 --> 00:20:23,820
To the local shrine

369
00:20:25,090 --> 00:20:27,560
There are 4 households with a total of 7 people living here

370
00:20:27,560 --> 00:20:32,210
Sanjin-shita, Sakuraga, Kurikoma, Kurihara, Miyagi Prefecture

371
00:20:33,110 --> 00:20:37,250
Sanjin is...
-Sanjin is...

372
00:20:37,250 --> 00:20:39,050
You can see it from my house

373
00:20:41,090 --> 00:20:50,190
When I was a child, the elders there would educate me like my parents did

374
00:20:50,190 --> 00:20:51,900
A real family

375
00:20:52,380 --> 00:20:54,800
In fact, here

376
00:20:54,800 --> 00:20:56,330
Can you tell me your name?

377
00:20:56,330 --> 00:20:58,170
I'm Kano Musaki

378
00:20:58,720 --> 00:21:02,770
All the residents are named Kano

379
00:21:02,510 --> 00:21:05,430
It's okay, right?
-I also think so

380
00:21:03,810 --> 00:21:09,110
If i'm not 1st here then it'll be humiliating

381
00:21:08,320 --> 00:21:09,570
Indeed

382
00:21:09,990 --> 00:21:13,610
There are 7 residents in this area

383
00:21:13,610 --> 00:21:20,010
Except for one who is too old to be interviewed and Kano's mother

384
00:21:20,010 --> 00:21:22,330
We asked the remaining 5

385
00:21:22,460 --> 00:21:23,760
This isn't M-1

386
00:21:23,770 --> 00:21:25,660
M-1 Grand Final

387
00:21:28,790 --> 00:21:31,860
Initially a clear winner was not clear

388
00:21:31,860 --> 00:21:36,240
And so, the result will be decided by the last Kano

389
00:21:35,780 --> 00:21:37,980
It's up to him

390
00:21:38,010 --> 00:21:41,650
And so, Kano Musaki's favorite comedian is...

391
00:21:42,450 --> 00:21:46,080
We met during the recording of a program at the shrine

392
00:21:46,080 --> 00:21:47,790
What did you think?

393
00:21:47,790 --> 00:21:51,190
Certainly a superstar aura

394
00:21:50,680 --> 00:21:52,090
Who is it?

395
00:21:51,390 --> 00:21:53,320
Who is your favorite comedian?

396
00:21:53,320 --> 00:21:54,830
Sandwichman

397
00:21:55,340 --> 00:22:01,500
Despite all the participants being Kano's, Kano Eiko is still unable to achieve 1st

398
00:22:01,380 --> 00:22:03,200
Shouldn't it be unanimous?

399
00:22:04,870 --> 00:22:07,640
It's a lie, right?

400
00:22:08,940 --> 00:22:11,380
Really?
-Really

401
00:22:11,380 --> 00:22:13,640
Why not Kano Eiko?

402
00:22:13,640 --> 00:22:19,380
Sandwichman has introduced Miyagi to everyone through many programs

403
00:22:19,380 --> 00:22:23,450
But Kano Eiko doesn't even mention Miyagi that much

404
00:22:24,250 --> 00:22:29,520
So, we ended up at Sakurada Shrine, Kano's old home

405
00:22:28,750 --> 00:22:30,400
1 person
-Just 1

406
00:22:30,390 --> 00:22:32,260
We went to the house

407
00:22:32,260 --> 00:22:33,630
Also known as the shrine

408
00:22:33,630 --> 00:22:34,900
106
-Right

409
00:22:35,900 --> 00:22:37,500
Wait a second

410
00:22:37,500 --> 00:22:40,200
I'm so scared. I'm sorry

411
00:22:40,570 --> 00:22:44,340
With all these rankings of 2nd

412
00:22:44,340 --> 00:22:49,010
I'm a little afraid of what my mum will say when I go back home

413
00:22:49,400 --> 00:22:55,700
The other party agreed to the interview without being told the name of the project or program

414
00:22:55,700 --> 00:22:57,700
Let's get right to the point

415
00:22:58,990 --> 00:23:04,040
We're a TBS show that's investigating people's favorite comedians

416
00:23:04,040 --> 00:23:06,800
Which one do you like the most?

417
00:23:06,800 --> 00:23:09,830
Favorite comedian...

418
00:23:09,830 --> 00:23:14,410
That's...yeah

419
00:23:14,410 --> 00:23:16,310
Sandwichman

420
00:23:17,010 --> 00:23:18,820
No way
-Why?

421
00:23:19,080 --> 00:23:20,040
Leave me alone for a moment

422
00:23:20,280 --> 00:23:23,610
Turn on the air conditioning

423
00:23:22,420 --> 00:23:23,920
Getting hot

424
00:23:23,850 --> 00:23:27,520
Is this Kano Eiko's hometown?
-Yes, it is

425
00:23:27,520 --> 00:23:29,120
Why not your own son?

426
00:23:29,120 --> 00:23:32,720
I do like my son, yes

427
00:23:32,720 --> 00:23:35,730
But considering the parent-child relationship

428
00:23:35,990 --> 00:23:41,400
Our project allows family members to vote. Do you still think...

429
00:23:41,530 --> 00:23:46,840
I still think Sandwichman is the funniest

430
00:23:46,840 --> 00:23:48,970
If you were to ask me which comedian I like the most

431
00:23:48,970 --> 00:23:52,810
I wouldn't hesitate to say Sandwichman

432
00:23:55,680 --> 00:23:57,380
This questionnaire is so hurtful

433
00:23:57,380 --> 00:24:01,420
I'm gonna have heart problems

434
00:24:01,420 --> 00:24:07,560
In summary
Kano can't get 1st anywhere in Japan no matter what

435
00:24:07,670 --> 00:24:09,930
The results are amazing!
-Interesting

436
00:24:09,930 --> 00:24:11,970
An unexpected result
-Yes

437
00:24:11,970 --> 00:24:16,030
It's not Kano's fault, Sandwichman are just too good

438
00:24:16,030 --> 00:24:17,450
Indeed

439
00:24:17,450 --> 00:24:21,740
You can't not like them

440
00:24:21,740 --> 00:24:23,570
Can't not
-They're personas are great

441
00:24:23,570 --> 00:24:27,960
Their personas, especially Date who is super cheerful

442
00:24:27,960 --> 00:24:30,500
Very gentle and will chat with anyone

443
00:24:30,500 --> 00:24:32,020
Really great

444
00:24:32,020 --> 00:24:33,350
Honoka what do you think?

445
00:24:33,350 --> 00:24:35,820
The range is so small, but he still couldn't get 1st

446
00:24:35,820 --> 00:24:39,420
Is it a problem with the person himself?

447
00:24:39,420 --> 00:24:45,970
You should wear a normal hat when snowplowing, otherwise the locals won't be happy

448
00:24:45,970 --> 00:24:48,730
Who wears a Chaplin hat while snow plowing?

449
00:24:50,740 --> 00:24:53,470
Let's welcome the next presenter

450
00:24:57,940 --> 00:25:02,730
It's A Masso

451
00:25:02,730 --> 00:25:03,660
A rare guest!

452
00:25:03,660 --> 00:25:05,620
Thank you for having us, we are A Masso

453
00:25:05,620 --> 00:25:07,330
Thank you everyone

454
00:25:07,330 --> 00:25:09,530
It's your first time here, right?
-Yes, the first time

455
00:25:09,530 --> 00:25:13,220
So, this time, whether its theater performances or commercial performances

456
00:25:13,220 --> 00:25:18,600
There's bound to be some interruptions at some point

457
00:25:18,600 --> 00:25:20,430
Such as children suddenly crying

458
00:25:20,430 --> 00:25:23,340
Or an old man making noise

459
00:25:23,340 --> 00:25:24,760
Has Downtown ever encountered such a thing?

460
00:25:24,760 --> 00:25:28,720
There were several times, but the first one that comes to mind is

461
00:25:28,720 --> 00:25:33,640
One time a drunk shouted "Speak seriously!", a drunk old man

462
00:25:33,640 --> 00:25:36,020
Hamada replied "Ahhhh!"

463
00:25:36,020 --> 00:25:36,910
Scary

464
00:25:36,910 --> 00:25:40,510
He even shouted at the audience and said "How much are the tickets?"

465
00:25:40,510 --> 00:25:43,440
"3,000 yen." "I'll give it back to you!"

466
00:25:43,930 --> 00:25:44,970
"Get the hell out!"

467
00:25:44,970 --> 00:25:47,230
Such a thing did occur

468
00:25:47,560 --> 00:25:49,400
This is an issue, is it not?

469
00:25:49,400 --> 00:25:53,770
Then on the side I said "Oh, you shouldn't say that."

470
00:25:55,240 --> 00:25:58,390
To make people think "the old man's just talking to much"

471
00:25:59,170 --> 00:26:01,510
But it lightened the mood
-That's it.

472
00:26:01,510 --> 00:26:03,960
Exactly, interruptions can be overcome

473
00:26:03,960 --> 00:26:07,510
In fact, it can make things even funnier

474
00:26:07,510 --> 00:26:10,510
This time we have brought this project, please take a look

475
00:26:10,510 --> 00:26:14,720
Unexpected Occurrence Incorporation Championship

476
00:26:18,280 --> 00:26:22,720
This time, it is not a test of one's ability to deal with an unexpected occurrence

477
00:26:22,720 --> 00:26:26,810
Instead, its to add the occurrence to the performance

478
00:26:26,810 --> 00:26:34,410
A contest to get a laugh from adding an unexpected occurrence to the performance

479
00:26:35,960 --> 00:26:38,940
Unexpected Occurrence Incorporation Championship

480
00:26:39,960 --> 00:26:42,360
The first to challenge are

481
00:26:43,680 --> 00:26:45,880
Hello

482
00:26:46,840 --> 00:26:48,350
A Masso

483
00:26:49,450 --> 00:26:52,220
You're going to perform a sketch later
-Yes

484
00:26:52,220 --> 00:26:53,490
How do you feel?

485
00:26:53,490 --> 00:26:56,160
There is a very strange sense of tension

486
00:26:56,160 --> 00:26:58,530
Because unexpected things are going to happen

487
00:26:58,530 --> 00:27:01,770
We won't be able to finish our sketch properly

488
00:27:01,770 --> 00:27:03,930
This is already established

489
00:27:03,930 --> 00:27:06,400
Feeling a little unmotivated

490
00:27:07,150 --> 00:27:09,450
Back two weeks ago

491
00:27:10,140 --> 00:27:12,340
It's difficult

492
00:27:12,580 --> 00:27:15,380
To conceptualize a sketch

493
00:27:15,380 --> 00:27:21,390
Or determine the occurrence first and then work out a sketch around it

494
00:27:21,450 --> 00:27:22,850
You should be used to it, right?

495
00:27:22,850 --> 00:27:24,790
Don't I always forget my words?

496
00:27:25,160 --> 00:27:28,160
No, that's an issue of our own making
-Is it?

497
00:27:28,780 --> 00:27:35,890
This new mode of writing leaves the writer at a loss

498
00:27:37,020 --> 00:27:40,570
But on the sixth day of writing the sketch

499
00:27:40,670 --> 00:27:42,870
How's it going?

500
00:27:42,870 --> 00:27:46,540
Ah, it's finished at least.

501
00:27:46,710 --> 00:27:48,810
I thought of many kinds of unexpected situations

502
00:27:48,810 --> 00:27:53,750
As I wanted to include the kind of unexpected occurrence that could actually happen

503
00:27:53,750 --> 00:27:56,920
That's how I was able to finish

504
00:27:57,330 --> 00:28:02,490
At this point, the content of the sketch is confirmed for the first time

505
00:28:03,660 --> 00:28:08,070
It's a sketch that reeks of desperation
-It is desperate

506
00:28:08,070 --> 00:28:12,500
Bravely facing a difficulty
-It's pretty brave

507
00:28:13,110 --> 00:28:17,870
What difficulty will A Masso face?

508
00:28:18,380 --> 00:28:21,330
Hello everyone

509
00:28:22,220 --> 00:28:27,340
Hello everyone, we are A Masso, thank you

510
00:28:27,340 --> 00:28:28,980
First time seeing these friends

511
00:28:30,170 --> 00:28:32,210
Don't fart!

512
00:28:32,210 --> 00:28:34,970
Why did you fart at the start?
-Sorry, sorry, sorry

513
00:28:34,970 --> 00:28:36,920
Stop farting.
-Sorry everyone

514
00:28:36,920 --> 00:28:39,680
Sorry, my name is Kano

515
00:28:39,680 --> 00:28:41,470
The one who made the sound is Murakami

516
00:28:41,470 --> 00:28:44,110
Thank you

517
00:28:44,110 --> 00:28:50,140
Don't mention it. Anyway, the temperature difference is really big lately.
-Yes, it is

518
00:28:50,140 --> 00:28:53,040
â€»Shinobu Sakagami, an fiery actor and host

519
00:28:50,140 --> 00:28:53,050
Sometimes it's as hot as Sakagami in the morning

520
00:28:53,040 --> 00:28:54,910
â€»Kenshu Furuichi, a social scientist, a writer, and a frequent critic of variety shows with calm venom

521
00:28:53,050 --> 00:28:54,920
The night is as cold as Furuichi

522
00:28:54,920 --> 00:28:56,730
I get it. I get it.
-It's true

523
00:28:56,730 --> 00:29:01,090
So it's hard to adjust the body temperature.
-It's hard, indeed

524
00:29:01,090 --> 00:29:04,540
So i've come up with a great idea.
-What idea?

525
00:29:04,540 --> 00:29:07,300
Wearing a cardigan is good

526
00:29:07,300 --> 00:29:10,410
Isn't that brilliant? Isn't that super brilliant?

527
00:29:10,410 --> 00:29:13,300
No matter what the weather as long as there is a cardigan it's all good
-It's too strong

528
00:29:13,300 --> 00:29:16,220
The weather bureau should make good use of her

529
00:29:16,220 --> 00:29:18,390
Superb!
-Cardigans are good, right?

530
00:29:18,390 --> 00:29:21,510
The best thing is, in terms of cardigans

531
00:29:21,510 --> 00:29:25,400
There are different kinds of cardigans, right?

532
00:29:25,400 --> 00:29:29,030
How about a cardigan like this one?
-Is that one a cardigan?

533
00:29:29,030 --> 00:29:31,910
Isn't this a little thick? Thicker, right?

534
00:29:31,910 --> 00:29:34,650
But the color match is very good, right? The color of the cardigan
-Color matching...

535
00:29:34,650 --> 00:29:36,970
When going to TSUTAYA

536
00:29:34,650 --> 00:29:36,970
â€»TSUTAYA Niaoya Bookstore

537
00:29:36,970 --> 00:29:37,750
Black

538
00:29:37,750 --> 00:29:39,060
Black cardigans feel great

539
00:29:39,060 --> 00:29:41,740
Everyone look at this black
-Yes, this black

540
00:29:41,740 --> 00:29:47,290
This black color is good, right?
-Indeed, this black cardigan is very good

541
00:29:47,290 --> 00:29:51,660
But how can I say it, there is still a bit inadequate

542
00:29:51,660 --> 00:29:54,620
The feel, right? Black is a bit earthy

543
00:29:55,400 --> 00:29:59,710
Kir~

544
00:30:01,290 --> 00:30:03,430
What are you angry about all of a sudden?

545
00:30:03,430 --> 00:30:05,770
Can you stop saying "not good enough"?
-Sorry, sorry, sorry

546
00:30:05,770 --> 00:30:07,720
I didn't expect you to be so angry

547
00:30:07,720 --> 00:30:10,380
Talking of "inadequate"

548
00:30:10,380 --> 00:30:13,750
I hate second generation comedians that look down on young artists

549
00:30:13,750 --> 00:30:17,670
Who does? Which second generation comedians?

550
00:30:17,670 --> 00:30:21,870
Let's not talk about that, what kind of cardigan do you think is good?
-What kind of cardigan?

551
00:30:21,870 --> 00:30:24,060
Let me think

552
00:30:24,060 --> 00:30:26,130
Liquid cardigan
-What's that?

553
00:30:26,130 --> 00:30:28,610
How long are you gonna talk about this!?

554
00:30:28,610 --> 00:30:31,600
Please leave, you who are not feeling well.
-Get out, get out!

555
00:30:31,600 --> 00:30:37,050
Thank you for reminding me. I forgot to mention that if you feel unwell, please leave

556
00:30:37,050 --> 00:30:39,390
Seriously, if you don't feel well, please go
-You guys are so boring

557
00:30:39,390 --> 00:30:43,380
Of course, of course, you will leave if you don't feel well, you will leave, right?

558
00:30:43,790 --> 00:30:44,950
Boring as hell!

559
00:30:44,950 --> 00:30:48,550
Everyone, if you have something important to do, please leave

560
00:30:48,550 --> 00:30:50,520
Sorry, I just forgot to say thank you very much

561
00:30:50,520 --> 00:30:51,520
So boring!

562
00:30:50,530 --> 00:30:55,100
â€»"Boring" and "clogged" are similar in pronunciation

563
00:30:51,520 --> 00:30:55,110
Those who have clogged noses, please leave to unclog your nose

564
00:30:55,110 --> 00:30:58,810
I'm sorry, I really appreciate it. So let's continue

565
00:30:58,810 --> 00:31:03,430
As I was saying, about cardigans, which cardigan is better?

566
00:31:03,430 --> 00:31:07,950
The liquid cardigan is best
-What is liquid...

567
00:31:07,950 --> 00:31:11,400
Get off!
-It's weird, right? A cardigan is a jacket, right?

568
00:31:11,950 --> 00:31:14,330
A cardigan is a jacket

569
00:31:14,330 --> 00:31:16,180
Liquid cardigans are not acceptable

570
00:31:16,180 --> 00:31:17,390
If a cardigan is liquid

571
00:31:17,390 --> 00:31:19,750
It can't be folded into this sort of shape, right?

572
00:31:19,750 --> 00:31:23,100
In the end, cardigans need to be carried around...

573
00:31:23,970 --> 00:31:25,530
Liquid cardigan...

574
00:31:29,400 --> 00:31:32,540
Eh? There's a typhoon today?

575
00:31:32,540 --> 00:31:35,640
What a mess!
-It's so windy today

576
00:31:35,640 --> 00:31:39,440
Staff, please close the door.
-The door is open

577
00:31:39,440 --> 00:31:44,500
Sorry, this isn't a backpack flea market

578
00:31:44,500 --> 00:31:45,920
Sorry

579
00:31:45,920 --> 00:31:47,610
A a cardigan with that shirt would look good

580
00:31:47,610 --> 00:31:50,790
This type of shirt is a good match

581
00:31:50,790 --> 00:31:53,970
The cardigan is very versatile

582
00:31:53,970 --> 00:31:58,620
No, I was asking "which cardigan is better"

583
00:31:58,620 --> 00:32:02,280
After thinking about it, I still think

584
00:32:03,830 --> 00:32:06,500
A cardigan as big as this is good

585
00:32:06,500 --> 00:32:08,940
What are you talking about? That's enough!

586
00:32:09,270 --> 00:32:11,000
Awesome
-Very good

587
00:32:13,780 --> 00:32:16,380
Thank you

588
00:32:17,910 --> 00:32:19,350
How did you feel about the performance?

589
00:32:19,350 --> 00:32:21,450
Not bad

590
00:32:21,450 --> 00:32:23,690
The concept wasn't bad

591
00:32:23,690 --> 00:32:26,490
Maybe we're good with unexpected occurences
-Seems so

592
00:32:26,490 --> 00:32:29,630
I think we now have more confidence to perform like this in the theater in the future

593
00:32:30,160 --> 00:32:35,520
In addition, this time, in addition to the crowd of actors responsible for creating accidents

594
00:32:36,100 --> 00:32:42,730
The general audience knows that something unexpected will happen but does not know the details

595
00:32:43,390 --> 00:32:46,810
The next challengers are

596
00:32:46,810 --> 00:32:49,010
Hello

597
00:32:50,030 --> 00:32:52,370
Punk Booboo

598
00:32:52,380 --> 00:32:54,180
Never done it before

599
00:32:54,180 --> 00:32:56,790
I wonder what will become of it

600
00:32:57,620 --> 00:33:01,690
It is true that you have to do it once to know

601
00:33:01,690 --> 00:33:07,760
And there is still that little feeling of embarrassment

602
00:33:07,760 --> 00:33:09,970
Shame
-Shame indeed

603
00:33:09,970 --> 00:33:12,300
When your partner makes a surprised expression

604
00:33:12,300 --> 00:33:18,340
Inside you're thinking "You know what's happening"
-It's true

605
00:33:19,060 --> 00:33:26,360
What will happen in Punk Booboo's sketch?

606
00:33:29,150 --> 00:33:34,100
Hello everyone, we are Punk Booboo

607
00:33:34,100 --> 00:33:38,570
Thank you very much

608
00:33:38,570 --> 00:33:41,620
Not everyone is willing to wave.
-Indeed

609
00:33:41,620 --> 00:33:45,080
Thanks for coming, and I hope you'll remember us, Punk Booboo

610
00:33:45,080 --> 00:33:49,080
If you remember, please go
-Please don't go. There's more to come

611
00:33:49,080 --> 00:33:50,520
Please remain seated

612
00:33:50,520 --> 00:33:52,420
I've been thinking lately.
-What's going on?

613
00:33:52,420 --> 00:33:54,170
Japanese society has become really unsettled

614
00:33:54,170 --> 00:33:55,690
Oh, there is indeed a lot of terrible news

615
00:33:55,690 --> 00:33:57,790
It's really annoying. A lot of things have happened

616
00:33:57,790 --> 00:34:00,320
So, you'd better practice that

617
00:34:00,320 --> 00:34:01,560
That? What does that mean?

618
00:34:01,560 --> 00:34:03,490
Yes, pray for mercy

619
00:34:04,070 --> 00:34:07,690
Praying for mercy must be practiced, if you don't your life will be threatened
-You don't need to practice it

620
00:34:07,690 --> 00:34:10,740
This kind of thing comes naturally
-No one does it, right?

621
00:34:10,740 --> 00:34:13,000
I haven't.
-Its good to practice then

622
00:34:13,000 --> 00:34:14,970
Can you pretend to be a murderer?
-I'll play the murderer

623
00:34:14,970 --> 00:34:16,510
I'll beg you to spare my life in order not to be killed

624
00:34:16,510 --> 00:34:19,330
Ok, I'll just say something like "I'm going to shoot" and so on

625
00:34:19,330 --> 00:34:23,400
Hey, you, I'm going to shoot you

626
00:34:23,400 --> 00:34:24,400
Wait a second

627
00:34:24,400 --> 00:34:26,150
Ne ne

628
00:34:26,560 --> 00:34:29,130
Ne ne ne

629
00:34:29,130 --> 00:34:30,860
That's not going to work, is it?

630
00:34:30,860 --> 00:34:33,310
Why do you only say "ne ne ne"?

631
00:34:33,310 --> 00:34:35,150
Neh neh neh
-No, no, no. That's the same

632
00:34:35,150 --> 00:34:36,780
Nu?
-That's not the point

633
00:34:36,780 --> 00:34:38,850
What's with this line anyway
-Then what line is allowed

634
00:34:38,850 --> 00:34:41,320
No, no, no, you have to talk.
-Say something?

635
00:34:41,320 --> 00:34:45,600
I have to talk. "Wait, please listen to me."
-Oh, "Please listen to me."

636
00:34:45,600 --> 00:34:47,640
Yeah, you have to let him hear you out. Come on

637
00:34:47,640 --> 00:34:50,380
Hey, you!
-Wait a minute, please listen to me...

638
00:34:51,420 --> 00:34:54,540
Wait a minute. Let's wait for the announcement in the museum to finish

639
00:34:54,540 --> 00:34:58,250
Attention all guests in the venue

640
00:34:59,000 --> 00:35:09,770
A wallet has been found near the men's room, can the owner please collect it from the front desk on the first floor

641
00:35:11,840 --> 00:35:17,750
You guys didn't drop your wallets, right? No, right? Then it's you

642
00:35:18,400 --> 00:35:21,330
Wait a minute, please listen to me

643
00:35:21,330 --> 00:35:23,980
Mama...

644
00:35:24,950 --> 00:35:28,710
Mama...
-Anyway, listen to this kid before you listen to me.

645
00:35:28,710 --> 00:35:30,070
Ask this child first

646
00:35:31,880 --> 00:35:34,320
What's wrong, boy? What's wrong?

647
00:35:34,320 --> 00:35:36,130
Mama is gone...

648
00:35:36,130 --> 00:35:41,020
I can't find my mother!
Then what's your name?

649
00:35:41,020 --> 00:35:42,920
Kouji
-Kouji

650
00:35:42,920 --> 00:35:44,960
Kouji can't find his mother

651
00:35:44,960 --> 00:35:49,260
Is Kouji's mother here?

652
00:35:49,260 --> 00:35:54,890
Ah, I found Kouji's mother!

653
00:35:55,500 --> 00:36:01,720
The child is standing here crying and the mother isn't coming to get him, really kind-hearted

654
00:36:02,590 --> 00:36:03,730
A bit embarrassed, right?

655
00:36:03,730 --> 00:36:06,390
It's okay, it's okay.
-Children are fine

656
00:36:06,390 --> 00:36:11,750
It's the parents who are in the wrong.
-Don't say that. It's not allowed

657
00:36:11,750 --> 00:36:15,300
So anyway, this is the perfect way to beg for mercy
-It's not perfect

658
00:36:15,300 --> 00:36:17,470
The child was saved
-Not saved at all!

659
00:36:17,470 --> 00:36:20,600
Only the child was saved. You have to be saved too

660
00:36:20,600 --> 00:36:23,050
Add a little more pleading.
-Pleading?

661
00:36:23,050 --> 00:36:26,690
"Wait a minute. I'll do anything."
-"I'll do anything."

662
00:36:26,690 --> 00:36:30,730
Yes, and then they'll say, "What can you do?" That's fine.
-That's it.

663
00:36:30,730 --> 00:36:32,190
Hey, you!

664
00:36:32,190 --> 00:36:35,510
Wait a minute. I'll do anything.
-What can you do?

665
00:36:35,510 --> 00:36:37,410
I'll quit smoking and I'll eat more vegetables...

666
00:36:37,410 --> 00:36:39,830
Well, I will quit smoking and will eat vegetables.

667
00:36:39,830 --> 00:36:43,250
And will say to the lighting technician to turn on the lights
-Hey turn on the light!

668
00:36:44,900 --> 00:36:47,250
What's going on? Ah the light is on now

669
00:36:48,470 --> 00:36:51,060
It's a perfect save
-It's not perfect

670
00:36:51,060 --> 00:36:54,320
It just got darker then and brighter. You're completely hopeless.
-That's it

671
00:36:54,320 --> 00:36:56,780
You don't know how to ask for mercy.
-Don't I?

672
00:36:56,780 --> 00:37:00,240
You have to appeal to their sense of sympathy

673
00:37:00,230 --> 00:37:03,500
â€»"sympathy" and "dojo"are similar in pronunciation

674
00:37:00,240 --> 00:37:03,510
How about ask him if he wants to practice karate together.
-No, no, no, no, no. Not dojo

675
00:37:03,960 --> 00:37:06,490
is to elicit sympathy
-How can I elicit sympathy?

676
00:37:06,490 --> 00:37:11,600
"Wait a minute, I have a wife and children that I love very much."
-"I have a wife and children that I love very much"

677
00:37:11,600 --> 00:37:15,770
Then the other party may stop
-So that's how it is

678
00:37:15,770 --> 00:37:18,980
Hey, I'll kill you, you son of a bitch!
-Wait a minute, I have...

679
00:37:18,980 --> 00:37:22,750
Hey, why haven't you contacted me lately?

680
00:37:22,910 --> 00:37:24,680
A good occurrence

681
00:37:24,390 --> 00:37:29,590
Well, I'm still working.
-You said you'd marry me, right? What happened?

682
00:37:29,590 --> 00:37:31,990
Did I say that? Did I said that?
-You said it

683
00:37:31,990 --> 00:37:34,560
Did he say he'd marry you?
-Yeah. Were you lying to me?

684
00:37:34,560 --> 00:37:38,310
Wait a minute, this guy already has a wife and kid he loves.
-What are you talking about?

685
00:37:38,310 --> 00:37:40,420
Is that so?
-No, it's not

686
00:37:40,420 --> 00:37:42,290
Scum
-No

687
00:37:42,290 --> 00:37:45,240
I'll tell the press about you.
-The press...ah, it hurts.

688
00:37:45,860 --> 00:37:47,270
Wait a second

689
00:37:47,270 --> 00:37:49,210
She hit harder than I expected

690
00:37:51,250 --> 00:37:55,780
I said "wife and children who I love so much."
-Why say that to her?

691
00:37:56,210 --> 00:37:57,720
What's wrong? What's that sound?

692
00:37:57,720 --> 00:38:01,050
Nobody move!
-Be quiet

693
00:38:01,760 --> 00:38:02,670
Wait a second

694
00:38:02,670 --> 00:38:07,220
Na na na na na na na

695
00:38:10,620 --> 00:38:12,960
I can't believe it really worked.
-That's enough!

696
00:38:12,960 --> 00:38:15,050
Thank you very much

697
00:38:17,470 --> 00:38:19,010
How do you feel after the performance?

698
00:38:19,010 --> 00:38:21,580
I'm not sure

699
00:38:21,580 --> 00:38:26,050
Whether it went well or not...
-Unsure

700
00:38:26,050 --> 00:38:32,320
But the audience laughed more than I expected
-They did laugh

701
00:38:32,560 --> 00:38:33,960
What exactly is the reason for them laughing?

702
00:38:33,960 --> 00:38:38,330
We are also still figuring it out

703
00:38:38,330 --> 00:38:41,400
But it went smoothly

704
00:38:41,400 --> 00:38:43,370
Although there were unexpected occurrences

705
00:38:43,370 --> 00:38:46,070
We knew what would happen

706
00:38:46,070 --> 00:38:48,500
So we reacted a little then moved on

707
00:38:48,500 --> 00:38:51,010
Maybe going a bit deeper would be better

708
00:38:51,010 --> 00:38:53,810
There are still some places to explore

709
00:38:51,790 --> 00:38:52,940
Introspection!

710
00:38:54,290 --> 00:38:57,190
So, the final challenger is

711
00:38:58,280 --> 00:39:00,450
Thank you for having me

712
00:39:01,480 --> 00:39:02,860
ZAZY

713
00:39:04,510 --> 00:39:07,650
I've had audiences laughing in strange places all the time.

714
00:39:07,650 --> 00:39:10,920
I can't solve it at all by myself

715
00:39:10,920 --> 00:39:13,400
So I have to take advantage of such

716
00:39:14,600 --> 00:39:16,470
Halfway through the bit
-End it quickly

717
00:39:17,330 --> 00:39:19,770
Isn't this just a project aimed at me?

718
00:39:19,940 --> 00:39:22,970
During the R-1 competition last year

719
00:39:22,970 --> 00:39:27,280
The flap on the results wouldn't flip over

720
00:39:27,280 --> 00:39:32,320
I said "Ah..." for the first time in a live competition

721
00:39:32,320 --> 00:39:33,880
There is such a sad past

722
00:39:34,120 --> 00:39:38,690
So I am very sensitive to accidents

723
00:39:38,790 --> 00:39:43,590
Now that I can control such issues I'm very much looking forward to

724
00:39:44,140 --> 00:39:50,370
What kind of skit will ZAZY, who is said to be immune to accidents, produce?

725
00:39:52,420 --> 00:39:59,490
Hello, everyone, I am ZAZY

726
00:40:02,730 --> 00:40:06,070
Please just take a moment to get used to the ZAZY look

727
00:40:06,070 --> 00:40:09,290
Looks like everyone is getting used to it. Thank you very much

728
00:40:09,290 --> 00:40:12,640
Today, when I was in the lounge.

729
00:40:12,640 --> 00:40:16,250
My hot pants ripped

730
00:40:17,120 --> 00:40:21,580
So I had to use the raw ham that comes with the free meal to make some more

731
00:40:22,980 --> 00:40:28,970
Can you tell? No problem, right?

732
00:40:25,100 --> 00:40:26,430
What the hell!?

733
00:40:27,030 --> 00:40:29,480
Raw ham with your meal?

734
00:40:28,970 --> 00:40:33,560
It's best you get used to seeing it, okay?

735
00:40:33,560 --> 00:40:39,930
Anyway, let's check out ZAZY's e-comic: Shibuya "Sushi Restaurant"!

736
00:40:41,130 --> 00:40:42,850

737
00:40:42,850 --> 00:40:45,420
Hello, one

00:40:45,420 --> 00:40:50,070
We only have a set menu. Is that okay?
-Yes

739
00:40:50,070 --> 00:40:53,330
Okay, let's start with sushi, please

740
00:40:53,330 --> 00:40:54,830
It's corn

741
00:40:54,830 --> 00:40:56,600
Corn?

742
00:40:57,200 --> 00:40:59,570
Next up is...corn
-Corn?

00:40:59,570 --> 00:41:05,940

755
00:41:22,940 --> 00:41:25,480
Hey, I don't get it!

756
00:41:31,000 --> 00:41:31,750

Toothless

768
00:41:44,010 --> 00:41:45,190

773
00:42:02,600 --> 00:42:04,740
I can't read it.
-Get off, get off!

774

Love you love you~

Hi Hi Hi Hyokkori

784
00:42:57,160 --> 00:43:00,200
Ah, what do you want?

785
00:43:00,200 --> 00:43:03,800
Is this Saito's room?

786
00:43:04,640 --> 00:43:07,510
This is the stage of ZAZY

787
00:43:07,510 --> 00:43:09,030
Excuse me

788
00:43:07,800 --> 00:43:09,330
What is this!?

789
00:43:09,330 --> 00:43:11,420
Messing around!

790
00:43:09,660 --> 00:43:11,120
Please wait a moment

791
00:43:11,560 --> 00:43:12,710
Please...

792
00:43:16,200 --> 00:43:18,630
Ah, thank you

793
00:43:18,630 --> 00:43:20,700
Please take care.
-Thanks

794
00:43:22,200 --> 00:43:23,990
Love you!

795
00:43:23,990 --> 00:43:27,100
It's almost time to wrap up

796
00:44:11,170 --> 00:44:16,760
Spring, the distant spring

797
00:44:16,760 --> 00:44:21,700
Close your eyes and you'll find her there

798
00:44:21,700 --> 00:44:26,950
Bringing you my love

799
00:44:26,950 --> 00:44:31,980
Your voice is ringing in my ears

800
00:44:33,760 --> 00:44:35,520
Hi, Hyokkorihan

801
00:44:36,860 --> 00:44:38,410
What?

802
00:44:44,590 --> 00:44:45,760
Thank you for your hard work

803
00:44:45,760 --> 00:44:47,360
Hmm

804
00:44:46,400 --> 00:44:48,480
He's changed suddenly

805
00:44:49,830 --> 00:44:55,340
No...a little confused, I guess?

806
00:44:55,340 --> 00:44:59,940
Feels like the least funny performance of the past six years

807
00:45:01,820 --> 00:45:03,420
So true

808
00:45:03,420 --> 00:45:05,420
He knows it himself!

809
00:45:05,420 --> 00:45:08,410
I just want to say "what is this?"

810
00:45:09,990 --> 00:45:12,770
But it was a performance with unexpected occurences

811
00:45:13,440 --> 00:45:17,660
So its tough to know where to end it

812
00:45:17,660 --> 00:45:19,670
Don't know what to focus on

813
00:45:19,670 --> 00:45:22,170
It's better to make the rules clearer

814
00:45:22,740 --> 00:45:25,360
It's really too free
-That's it

815
00:45:25,360 --> 00:45:27,230
This tournament can be done

816
00:45:27,230 --> 00:45:29,680
But there's no need to play it back on TVer

817
00:45:29,680 --> 00:45:33,780
Hey, why?
-Why do you say that? You can rewatch it!

818
00:45:33,780 --> 00:46:14,750
