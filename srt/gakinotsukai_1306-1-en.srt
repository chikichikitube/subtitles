Yeah, your voice was really loud today

12
00:00:14,540 --> 00:00:16,000
It really was

13
00:00:15,460 --> 00:00:18,130

You really were loud today

18
00:00:18,130 --> 00:00:20,130
We have been doing this for more than 20 years you know...

19
00:00:20,130 --> 00:00:22,770
No, your voice has gotten louder and louder

20
00:00:22,770 --> 00:00:26,940
No, we're saying this because

21
00:00:24,240 --> 00:00:26,940
it's louder than usual

22
00:00:26,310 --> 00:00:29,420
You never used to be this loud even...

23
00:00:29,620 --> 00:00:30,370
Right then

24
00:00:30,370 --> 00:00:32,820
Everyone, it's tomato juice, how are we feeling?

25
00:00:33,150 --> 00:00:33,910
But Hamada-san, you don't like tomatoes, do you

26
00:00:33,910 --> 00:00:35,850
But Hamada-san, you don't like tomatoes, do you

27
00:00:34,620 --> 00:00:35,850
That's right

28
00:00:35,850 --> 00:00:37,020
I mean, I will like, lick it

29
00:00:37,020 --> 00:00:38,720
I mean, I will like, lick it

30
00:00:39,120 --> 00:00:41,390
But he loves ketchup..

31
00:00:40,850 --> 00:00:41,940
Oh really, do you?

32
00:00:41,940 --> 00:00:42,820
I wouldn't say I love it...

33
00:00:42,820 --> 00:00:46,220
But I am happy to eat ketchup is what you mean

34
00:00:45,600 --> 00:00:47,140
No no no, like with anything

35
00:00:47,140 --> 00:00:48,510
I don't always use it or anything

36
00:00:48,430 --> 00:00:49,260
this is the same thing as ketchup

37
00:00:49,260 --> 00:00:51,630
this is the same thing as ketchup

38
00:00:50,970 --> 00:00:52,110
Yeah

39
00:00:52,060 --> 00:00:53,300
This isn't sweet though!

40
00:00:53,300 --> 00:00:56,600
Ketchup is really sweet

41
00:00:56,600 --> 00:00:58,840
Is that something for a 50 year old man to say?

42
00:00:59,200 --> 00:01:01,340
"It's nice because it's sweet" he says...

43
00:01:01,540 --> 00:01:01,740
From the 10

44
00:01:01,540 --> 00:01:01,740
find the tomato juice you drank

45
00:01:01,740 --> 00:01:01,940
From the 10

46
00:01:01,740 --> 00:01:01,940
find the tomato juice you drank

47
00:01:01,940 --> 00:01:09,350
From the 10

48
00:01:01,940 --> 00:01:09,350
find the tomato juice you drank

49
00:01:02,370 --> 00:01:04,710
The rules are really simple

50
00:01:04,710 --> 00:01:10,000
Just find the tomato juice that you drank from the ten available

51
00:01:09,710 --> 00:01:14,190
Get it right and receive 100,000 Yen

52
00:01:09,710 --> 00:01:14,190
Who will get the prize?

53
00:01:10,420 --> 00:01:14,370
Get it right and receive 100,000 Yen. Who will win the prize?

54
00:01:14,370 --> 00:01:16,370
I mean, you always go first

55
00:01:16,370 --> 00:01:17,820
Yeah

56
00:01:16,370 --> 00:01:17,820
so Tanaka, you go first

57
00:01:17,820 --> 00:01:19,820
Oh okay, then I will go first

58
00:01:19,820 --> 00:01:20,990
And do you drink tomato juice frequently?..

59
00:01:20,990 --> 00:01:23,230
No I hardly ever drink this

60
00:01:22,280 --> 00:01:23,570
Like seriously

61
00:01:23,230 --> 00:01:25,600
I think it's nearly been 10 years since I drank one...

62
00:01:25,600 --> 00:01:26,360
It's a lie, right? He's lying  right?

63
00:01:25,620 --> 00:01:27,540
It's a lie

64
00:01:26,360 --> 00:01:27,400
It's a lie, right? He's lying, right?

65
00:01:27,400 --> 00:01:31,070
There it is, a lie!!

66
00:01:27,940 --> 00:01:29,310
No no!

67
00:01:29,740 --> 00:01:31,220
That's taking it too far

68
00:01:31,440 --> 00:01:33,640
Your cowardliness has shown itself

69
00:01:33,650 --> 00:01:34,620
No no!

70
00:01:34,620 --> 00:01:36,620
After saying something like that...

71
00:01:37,110 --> 00:01:41,880
First Challenger

72
00:01:37,110 --> 00:01:41,880
First Challenger

73
00:01:37,110 --> 00:01:41,880
Tanaka Naoki

74
00:01:37,110 --> 00:01:41,880
Tanaka Naoki

75
00:01:38,110 --> 00:01:42,000
Being accused of being a coward, Tanaka goes first

76
00:01:43,170 --> 00:01:44,770
Choosing one is quite...

77
00:01:44,020 --> 00:01:44,770
Yeah..

78
00:01:45,340 --> 00:01:46,680
The first one is...

79
00:01:47,000 --> 00:01:50,710
The one chosen for him is from Hokkaido, JA Biratori

80
00:01:51,480 --> 00:01:54,200
Nispa's lover tomato juice unsalted

81
00:01:54,710 --> 00:01:57,740
It's sweet, thick and rich

82
00:01:57,740 --> 00:02:01,250
This taste, will he be able to distinguish it?

83
00:02:02,280 --> 00:02:03,250
The scent is really...

84
00:02:03,870 --> 00:02:06,200
The scent is really standard

85
00:02:07,220 --> 00:02:08,540
Standard?

86
00:02:08,540 --> 00:02:12,380
Can someone who hasn't drank one in 10 years

87
00:02:09,610 --> 00:02:12,380
know what is a standard scent?

88
00:02:11,220 --> 00:02:12,310
You shouldn't know

89
00:02:12,310 --> 00:02:14,050
You're so full of it

90
00:02:14,050 --> 00:02:16,050
Ittadakimasu

91
00:02:18,740 --> 00:02:20,310
It's thick

92
00:02:20,570 --> 00:02:21,200
Huh?

93
00:02:21,200 --> 00:02:23,200
Tomato juice has always been...

94
00:02:22,350 --> 00:02:23,490
It's so easy to drink

95
00:02:23,490 --> 00:02:24,760
How was it 10 years ago?

96
00:02:24,760 --> 00:02:27,230
It was way more difficult to drink

97
00:02:28,250 --> 00:02:30,340
I mean even so

98
00:02:29,280 --> 00:02:30,340
Yeah?

99
00:02:30,910 --> 00:02:34,170
It felt maybe like Kagome-san's tomato juice...

100
00:02:34,030 --> 00:02:49,180
Text

101
00:02:34,030 --> 00:02:49,180
Tomato Juice Unsalted

102
00:02:34,540 --> 00:02:35,420
That's what you feel?

103
00:02:35,420 --> 00:02:37,420
Yes, I get the impression that...

104
00:02:37,420 --> 00:02:39,420
Okay, I will start with this one

105
00:02:42,680 --> 00:02:46,850
Toma-ju... That's what we used to call it in cafe's...

106
00:02:46,850 --> 00:02:48,850
Yeah, they used to have it in the cafe's...

107
00:02:49,180 --> 00:03:16,510
Currently Tasting

108
00:02:49,180 --> 00:03:16,510
m 0 0 l 0 15 l 18 15 l 18 0

109
00:02:49,180 --> 00:03:41,670
Correct Answer

110
00:02:49,180 --> 00:03:41,670
m 0 0 l 0 15 l 18 15 l 18 0

111
00:02:49,400 --> 00:02:51,800
It always came with salt

112
00:02:51,980 --> 00:02:52,180
Wrong!!

113
00:02:52,180 --> 00:02:54,090
Wrong!!

114
00:02:56,050 --> 00:02:58,960
It's like 'Kiki yeah yeah' or something...

115
00:02:58,140 --> 00:02:59,620
Like 'Kiki yeah yeah'

116
00:02:59,620 --> 00:03:01,620
It's this different!

117
00:03:02,760 --> 00:03:06,600
It's the start of his stage show

118
00:03:05,000 --> 00:03:06,140
Really get the crowd engaged

119
00:03:06,140 --> 00:03:08,450
Yeah, he's trying to engage them and all

120
00:03:08,450 --> 00:03:12,740
This is amazing, it's so different, I'm so confident so I'm going for it

121
00:03:12,740 --> 00:03:16,400
The one I drank was NOT Kagome's tomato juice

122
00:03:16,610 --> 00:03:18,310
Correct!!

123
00:03:18,220 --> 00:03:18,940
Really different?

124
00:03:18,940 --> 00:03:20,140
It was so different

125
00:03:20,140 --> 00:03:21,110
Bit weird

126
00:03:21,110 --> 00:03:24,350
But it was like a difference from 100 to 0

127
00:03:22,170 --> 00:03:23,570
It was this different!

128
00:03:23,820 --> 00:03:25,570
I don't get what the hell you're on about

129
00:03:24,450 --> 00:03:25,570
Not a clue

130
00:03:25,570 --> 00:03:26,910
That's a weird comparison...

131
00:03:26,910 --> 00:03:29,110
It was this different

132
00:03:29,150 --> 00:03:30,390
Like 180 degrees different

133
00:03:30,540 --> 00:03:32,420
Like if you were drinking water different?

134
00:03:31,680 --> 00:03:32,420
Yeah

135
00:03:32,420 --> 00:03:35,000
That's basically what you're saying right?

136
00:03:33,570 --> 00:03:35,000
It really was,

137
00:03:35,540 --> 00:03:37,140
So 9 more

138
00:03:37,140 --> 00:03:38,740
Yeah, 9 more

139
00:03:38,740 --> 00:03:41,170
That's right

140
00:03:40,110 --> 00:03:41,170
You can do this

141
00:03:41,170 --> 00:03:44,570
I'm going for Itouen's mature tomatoes

142

144
00:03:44,570 --> 00:03:46,170
Because

145
00:03:46,170 --> 00:03:48,420
When I really drank it

146
00:03:48,420 --> 00:03:50,170
I felt the tomatoes

147
00:03:49,080 --> 00:03:50,170
"When you really drank it"...

148
00:03:50,170 --> 00:03:51,170
Yeah

149
00:03:51,450 --> 00:03:53,880
I really felt the tomatoes

150
00:03:53,880 --> 00:03:55,110
I see, I see

151
00:03:55,110 --> 00:03:56,880
You know, Tanaka

152
00:03:56,720 --> 00:03:59,480
He loves his mature women as well...

153
00:03:59,310 --> 00:04:01,310
Yeah, he really does

154
00:04:01,310 --> 00:04:03,590
Do I?

155
00:04:03,590 --> 00:04:04,360
So he's a coward and likes mature women

156
00:04:03,590 --> 00:04:38,560

Exactly

162
00:04:06,290 --> 00:04:09,090
He steals other guy's old women too...

163
00:04:09,080 --> 00:04:11,080
He just loves really old women...

164
00:04:11,080 --> 00:04:13,080
Yeah..

165
00:04:14,570 --> 00:04:16,200
At this point

166
00:04:16,200 --> 00:04:18,570
like it's a bit weird

167
00:04:17,340 --> 00:04:18,570
bit weird?..

168
00:04:18,970 --> 00:04:21,450
It's possible to say it's not this one

169
00:04:21,450 --> 00:04:23,020
Well obviously...

170
00:04:23,020 --> 00:04:24,940
Go for it

171
00:04:23,570 --> 00:04:24,940
You can do that

172
00:04:24,940 --> 00:04:27,000
You can say that

173
00:04:27,000 --> 00:04:29,710
No as in because the scent is different

174
00:04:31,600 --> 00:04:33,140
Oh no, it's wrong

175
00:04:33,140 --> 00:04:35,140
Damn!

176
00:04:35,690 --> 00:04:38,560

He distinguishes the subtle differences

184
00:04:48,000 --> 00:04:49,970

187
00:04:54,020 --> 00:04:56,620
He's not had any doubts so far

188
00:04:55,020 --> 00:04:56,620

Yeah, he's doing his stage show

199

It's not a show

200
00:05:23,450 --> 00:05:26,740

201
00:05:23,680 --> 00:05:26,740
It's not a show, I really want to get it right

206
00:05:39,650 --> 00:05:42,690

207
00:05:42,820 --> 00:05:44,510

208

211

213
00:06:00,200 --> 00:06:03,050
You didn't get it at all

214
00:06:07,050 --> 00:06:09,820
He seemed so confident...

215
00:06:09,820 --> 00:06:11,820
Here he comes

216
00:06:10,850 --> 00:06:11,820

00:06:11,820 --> 00:06:13,800

I don't think anyone has tried this one...

245
00:06:52,220 --> 00:06:55,140
The one chosen for him is Aeon Top Value

246
00:06:56,770 --> 00:06:58,940
It uses organic tomatoes

247
00:06:58,940 --> 00:07:02,480
and concerns its product to taste fresh

248
00:07:02,480 --> 00:07:05,770
Will he get it right?

249
00:07:06,620 --> 00:07:08,620
I'm going to drink it

250
00:07:10,910 --> 00:07:12,200
He said he was going to lick it anyway...

251
00:07:12,200 --> 00:07:14,200
Look at that...

252
00:07:17,880 --> 00:07:19,740
What's wrong with this guy?

253
00:07:18,050 --> 00:07:22,190

It's as Tanaka said, it's quite thick but it's

257
00:07:25,910 --> 00:07:27,310
also quite thin

258
00:07:27,310 --> 00:07:29,800
The ones with salt are easier to drink

259
00:07:29,800 --> 00:07:32,450
I think...

260
00:07:30,400 --> 00:07:32,450
That's true

261
00:07:34,220 --> 00:07:35,940
But seriously

262
00:07:35,940 --> 00:07:40,510
the whole 'tomato' factor has died down a bit

263
00:07:40,710 --> 00:07:45,200

As you'd expect, he knows that Kagome is the most basic one...

00:07:49,600 --> 00:07:51,600
Of course I do...

268
00:07:54,250 --> 00:07:55,970

275
00:08:01,000 --> 00:08:03,540
But he said the one before was odourless...

276
00:08:05,900 --> 00:08:07,600
I don't think this is right

277
00:08:08,480 --> 00:08:10,570
The one before was odourless, seriously

295
00:08:41,110 --> 00:08:42,420
He keeps saying that

297
00:08:43,370 --> 00:08:45,000

Even though he was sniffing it that much before...

306

And out comes the Kansai dialect...

324
00:09:39,360 --> 00:09:42,160
Hey, this one's really similar!!

325
00:09:42,460 --> 00:09:46,560
Don't say it like you're telling someone

326
00:09:43,230 --> 00:09:46,560
"Hey, your dogs ran off!"

327
00:09:48,670 --> 00:09:51,600
He said it so many times to me in the past

328
00:09:49,050 --> 00:09:51,420
This one is so hard!

329
00:09:49,600 --> 00:09:51,600
"Hey, your dogs ran off!"

330
00:09:51,970 --> 00:09:54,540
Matsumoto-san!!

331
00:09:54,540 --> 00:09:56,280
It was so annoying

332
00:09:56,280 --> 00:09:58,650
"Hey, your dogs ran off!!"

333
00:10:00,140 --> 00:10:02,740
I always used to think "Why would he run away?"

334
00:10:02,740 --> 00:10:05,170
I gave it food and all...

335
00:10:07,020 --> 00:10:11,740
The last bit where the taste comes in is confusing me

336
00:10:12,360 --> 00:10:13,630
Should I be going for it though...

337
00:10:13,630 --> 00:10:16,730
Should I be going for it though...

338
00:10:15,850 --> 00:10:18,140
It's just that last part confusing me

339
00:10:18,140 --> 00:10:21,080
That last part...

340
00:10:21,930 --> 00:10:23,600
I don't know

341
00:10:23,110 --> 00:10:25,110
The one I drank was

342
00:10:25,110 --> 00:10:29,680
NOT Aeon's organic tomato juice.

343
00:10:29,540 --> 00:10:32,780
Incorrect!!

344
00:10:30,620 --> 00:10:31,400
No way!

345
00:10:33,510 --> 00:10:34,750
I knew it!

346
00:10:34,750 --> 00:10:38,620
I knew it!

347
00:10:36,280 --> 00:10:38,620
It was that one!

348
00:10:38,620 --> 00:10:41,120
You were literally standing up there...

349
00:10:40,710 --> 00:10:42,480
You came up to that point

350
00:10:42,480 --> 00:10:43,510
Are you serious?

351
00:10:43,510 --> 00:10:45,740
The aftertaste was a bit different...

352
00:10:46,680 --> 00:10:48,080
This hurts so much...

353
00:10:48,090 --> 00:10:50,600
Shall I pay your salary with tomatoes!?

354
00:10:50,600 --> 00:10:52,130
Shall I pay your salary with tomatoes!?

355
00:10:52,130 --> 00:10:54,600
Shall I pay your salary with tomatoes!?

356
00:10:53,740 --> 00:10:54,740
I'm sorry

357
00:10:54,740 --> 00:10:56,740
I got that one

358
00:10:57,200 --> 00:10:58,940
Damn that's scary

359
00:10:58,940 --> 00:11:00,940
Damn that's scary

360
00:11:01,820 --> 00:11:04,110
Hold on a minute...

361
00:11:04,540 --> 00:11:05,620
Body blow..

362
00:11:05,620 --> 00:11:06,510
It really hurts, right?

363
00:11:06,910 --> 00:11:09,910
So I was right?!

364
00:11:08,050 --> 00:11:09,510
It was just as you said!

365
00:11:09,510 --> 00:11:10,420
Aeon-san...

366
00:11:10,420 --> 00:11:13,600
But seriously, you came up to here...

367
00:11:14,000 --> 00:11:15,570
I thought "Oh, he's got this"...

368
00:11:15,570 --> 00:11:17,570
Yeah, I did too

369
00:11:16,280 --> 00:11:17,570
You picked it up at a great time too

370
00:11:17,570 --> 00:11:20,740
If that's the case, then you should give me a hint like...

371
00:11:18,890 --> 00:11:21,730
As if!!

372
00:11:20,770 --> 00:11:22,770
Why the hell would I?

373
00:11:22,260 --> 00:11:25,830
Endo Shozo

374
00:11:22,260 --> 00:11:25,830
Endo Shozo

375
00:11:22,260 --> 00:11:25,830
Third Challenger

376
00:11:22,260 --> 00:11:25,830
Third Challenger

377
00:11:23,170 --> 00:11:26,340
Next, the chosen one for Endo...

378
00:11:27,140 --> 00:11:30,800
Yamagata's Tackle Farm's Rozorio Silver

379
00:11:31,000 --> 00:11:34,080
It's got a mellow sweetness and slightly creamy

380
00:11:34,080 --> 00:11:36,680
Will he be able to distinguish the taste?

381
00:11:38,280 --> 00:11:39,620
Oh man, I'm scared

382
00:11:39,620 --> 00:11:41,620
I'm really scared...

383
00:11:44,310 --> 00:11:46,250
Just give it to me normally...

384
00:11:46,450 --> 00:11:48,390
OWWW!!

385
00:11:47,420 --> 00:11:49,110
Wait, what...

386
00:11:49,110 --> 00:11:50,620
Wait...

387
00:11:49,600 --> 00:11:50,620
You'd never want that..

388
00:11:50,620 --> 00:11:51,510
Come on..

389
00:11:51,510 --> 00:11:53,510
You'd never want that done to you...

390
00:11:54,800 --> 00:11:55,960
I'm scared

391
00:11:55,960 --> 00:11:59,300
I can't concentrate at all...

392
00:11:59,760 --> 00:12:03,100
We're bored with this Kiki Hamada game!

393
00:12:01,770 --> 00:12:03,770
We know it's Hamada every time

394
00:12:04,050 --> 00:12:06,250
It's so obvious...

395
00:12:10,450 --> 00:12:11,440
Oh man, yeah...

396
00:12:11,440 --> 00:12:13,750
It's very nice

397
00:12:12,420 --> 00:12:14,020
It really is

398
00:12:14,000 --> 00:12:16,620
It's really thick and creamy though

399
00:12:18,310 --> 00:12:21,220
It's not refreshing, it kind of comes down slowly

400
00:12:21,220 --> 00:12:22,400
Slow and creamy?..

401
00:12:22,400 --> 00:12:23,860
Sorry...

402
00:12:23,860 --> 00:12:26,920
He always does this

403
00:12:24,710 --> 00:12:28,280
He loves doing this, the one finger...

404
00:12:28,280 --> 00:12:29,760
Yeah

405
00:12:29,760 --> 00:12:31,860
It's like the worst manner, hated by the whole world

406
00:12:31,860 --> 00:12:33,930
It's like the worst manner, hated by the whole world

407
00:12:33,200 --> 00:12:34,140
So true...

408
00:12:33,930 --> 00:12:37,000
I wonder what he plans on doing with that finger of his...

409
00:12:37,470 --> 00:12:40,440
For crying out loud, he wiped it on himself...

410
00:12:41,620 --> 00:12:46,570
This one uses 6 tomatoes, I'm going for Kagome's 'Sweet tomatoes'...

411

was NOT

Damn that's expensive!

433
00:13:18,020 --> 00:13:20,600
He's going for ones that no one's tried yet

434
00:13:20,600 --> 00:13:22,600
He's such a pro at Kiki...

435
00:13:27,020 --> 00:13:27,850

It's really delicious

443
00:13:36,230 --> 00:13:39,200
It's like sauce

444
00:13:37,820 --> 00:13:39,820
That's bad!

445
00:13:39,820 --> 00:13:41,500
Not ketchup but

446
00:13:41,500 --> 00:13:43,710

It genuinely

450
00:13:44,470 --> 00:13:48,070
tastes like Tonkatsu sauce!

451
00:13:45,800 --> 00:13:47,420
Tonkatsu?!

452
00:13:47,420 --> 00:13:50,200
That's awful! I don't want to drink a cup full of that

00:15:30,170 --> 00:15:31,220
Oh, his brain?

510
00:15:32,420 --> 00:15:33,620
There it is...

511
00:15:35,540 --> 00:15:36,850
It really does hurt

512
00:15:36,880 --> 00:15:38,820
When he started doing his Mori-san impersonation, I was thinking

513
00:15:38,820 --> 00:15:42,250
"Oh man, now is not the time"  you know?

514
00:15:41,310 --> 00:15:42,250
Because this one's the correct one...

515
00:15:42,250 --> 00:15:44,290
When I did the impersonation of Mori-san...

516
00:15:44,290 --> 00:15:47,790
For a second, I just totally forgot the taste

517
00:15:46,250 --> 00:15:48,250
Literally

518
00:15:48,560 --> 00:15:53,530
Fourth Challenger

519
00:15:48,560 --> 00:15:53,530
Fourth Challenger

520
00:15:48,560 --> 00:15:53,530
Tsukitei Hosei

521
00:15:48,560 --> 00:15:53,530
Tsukitei Hosei

522
00:15:49,800 --> 00:15:53,940
Next up is Hosei. The one selected...

523
00:15:54,850 --> 00:15:58,280
Yamagata Tackle Farm's Rozorio Silver

524
00:15:58,480 --> 00:16:01,540
It's sweet and creamy

525
00:16:01,540 --> 00:16:04,710
Will he be able to distinguish the difference?

526
00:16:07,850 --> 00:16:09,510
Do you drink it a lot?

527
00:16:08,510 --> 00:16:09,510
Mmh..

528
00:16:10,340 --> 00:16:12,080
Hold on?

529
00:16:12,710 --> 00:16:13,320
Give me a second

530
00:16:13,320 --> 00:16:15,350
I've never drank this one before

531
00:16:16,420 --> 00:16:17,540
Oh really?

532
00:16:17,540 --> 00:16:19,540
I don't know which ones he's drunk anyway...

533
00:16:19,540 --> 00:16:21,970
I've never drank this one before

534
00:16:23,110 --> 00:16:24,820
It really is odourless

535
00:16:25,000 --> 00:16:27,110
It's the one he was talking about

536
00:16:27,330 --> 00:16:29,800
I know

537
00:16:27,770 --> 00:16:29,800
You desperately want to hear some laughs soon

538
00:16:29,800 --> 00:16:32,040
When you screw up a joke you'll forget the taste...

539
00:16:31,680 --> 00:16:32,470
You're right

540
00:16:32,470 --> 00:16:34,910
I'm not going to talk anymore

541
00:16:36,370 --> 00:16:39,970
I don't think it's any of these

542
00:16:39,970 --> 00:16:41,740
Can I start over here?

543
00:16:41,740 --> 00:16:44,140
Oh, from the opposite side?

544
00:16:42,570 --> 00:16:44,140

It's totally different

What does it say?..

558
00:17:06,340 --> 00:17:11,180
His vision is worse

to approach it

585
00:17:52,740 --> 00:17:54,740
Approach?..

586
00:17:54,740 --> 00:17:56,050
I don't know what he's on about...

587
00:17:56,050 --> 00:17:59,080
I'm starting to approach the one I drank

588
00:17:59,080 --> 00:18:01,080

590
00:18:03,340 --> 00:18:05,200
Wait a minute...

591
00:18:05,200 --> 00:18:09,300
Would you choose yellow now?

592
00:18:08,450 --> 00:18:10,650
That's what I am on about...

593
00:18:11,280 --> 00:18:17,250
Would you actually choose a yellow tomato juice for the 4th challenger?..

594
00:18:22,250 --> 00:18:23,420
What was that?

595
00:18:23,420 --> 00:18:25,020
What the hell was that

596
00:18:25,020 --> 00:18:27,200
God he pisses me off.

597
00:18:26,020 --> 00:18:27,200
What the hell was that?

598
00:18:27,710 --> 00:18:29,370
Is he angry?

599
00:18:31,000 --> 00:18:31,880
I have no idea

600
00:18:31,880 --> 00:18:33,400
What on earth does it mean?

601
00:18:33,400 --> 00:18:35,220
I don't know

602
00:18:33,770 --> 00:18:35,220
He's changed his face

603
00:18:35,220 --> 00:18:36,650
He did...

604
00:18:36,650 --> 00:18:39,400
So, what are you trying to say?

605
00:18:37,200 --> 00:18:39,400
God if you saw him in town, you'd be so creeped out...

606
00:18:39,400 --> 00:18:41,400
You would...

607
00:18:42,600 --> 00:18:44,480
Would you choose this?..

608
00:18:46,170 --> 00:18:47,240
I mean

609
00:18:47,240 --> 00:18:49,010
It's this one!

610
00:18:51,420 --> 00:18:53,200
Thank you

611
00:18:54,650 --> 00:18:56,970
Oh man, it's been ages. But it can only be this one

612
00:18:57,250 --> 00:18:58,080
The taste is identical

613
00:18:58,080 --> 00:19:01,790
The taste is identical

614
00:18:59,220 --> 00:19:01,790
The scent is also identical!

615
00:19:00,450 --> 00:19:03,080
Right, please!

616
00:19:07,490 --> 00:19:10,530
Can you not see it?

617
00:19:11,250 --> 00:19:12,850
Of course they'll take the piss out of you...

618
00:19:12,850 --> 00:19:13,880
His eyes...

619
00:19:13,880 --> 00:19:16,200
It's Yellow Aiko

620
00:19:16,200 --> 00:19:18,650
Oh yeah, I did say that...

621
00:19:18,650 --> 00:19:21,940
He can't read that... That's so bad...

622
00:19:22,400 --> 00:19:24,020
The one I drank WAS

623
00:19:24,020 --> 00:19:27,080
Yellow Aiko!

624
00:19:26,940 --> 00:19:32,020
Incorrect!!

625
00:19:28,050 --> 00:19:29,600
So fast...

626
00:19:32,770 --> 00:19:34,140
Not at all...

627
00:19:34,140 --> 00:19:36,220
Get the bottle off him

628
00:19:35,000 --> 00:19:36,220
Oh yeah

629
00:19:36,220 --> 00:19:38,220
Give him the bottle

630
00:19:38,220 --> 00:19:39,540
Here he comes

631
00:19:39,540 --> 00:19:40,570
It looks so painful...

632
00:19:40,690 --> 00:19:43,090
Making crap comments all the time

633
00:19:43,090 --> 00:19:46,460
Making crap comments all the time

634
00:19:46,500 --> 00:19:47,630
you half-assed comedian!

635
00:19:47,630 --> 00:19:48,730

636
00:19:48,730 --> 00:19:50,800
you half-assed comedian!

637
00:19:55,670 --> 00:19:57,840
Oh my god that hurts!

638
00:19:57,110 --> 00:19:59,110
Did it hit you...

639
00:19:59,110 --> 00:20:01,110
Oh man, it hit him there...

640
00:20:01,110 --> 00:20:03,110
This is what happens when you get it wrong...

641
00:20:03,800 --> 00:20:06,420
Man I don't want to do this

642
00:20:05,000 --> 00:20:06,420
Hosei-san, it's this one

643
00:20:06,420 --> 00:20:08,420
Just wait a second...

644
00:20:08,420 --> 00:20:10,420
And he can't read it...

645
00:20:09,280 --> 00:20:11,170
I'll just leave it here...

646
00:20:11,170 --> 00:20:12,710
So Zaki-san...

647
00:20:12,760 --> 00:20:13,160
Wait, did I get it right?

648
00:20:13,160 --> 00:20:17,260
Wait, did I get it right?

649
00:20:14,710 --> 00:20:16,140
No no

650
00:20:16,140 --> 00:20:18,140
It was next to it

651
00:20:16,600 --> 00:20:18,160
Just next to is

652
00:20:18,160 --> 00:20:20,110
It would've been the next one you'd chosen

653
00:20:20,130 --> 00:20:21,170
If you got it correct, you wouldn't be punished!

654
00:20:21,170 --> 00:20:23,730
If you got it correct, you wouldn't be punished!

655
00:20:24,600 --> 00:20:30,110
Get it right, get 100,000 Yen, Get it wrong and get punished

656
00:20:24,600 --> 00:20:30,110
Kiki Tomato Juice

657
00:20:25,340 --> 00:20:29,850
Up to this point, all 4 have got it wrong in Kiki tomato juice!

658
00:20:30,340 --> 00:20:33,640
Fifth Challenger

659
00:20:30,340 --> 00:20:33,640
Fifth Challenger

660
00:20:30,340 --> 00:20:33,640
Matsumoto Hitoshi

661
00:20:30,340 --> 00:20:33,640
Matsumoto Hitoshi

662
00:20:31,170 --> 00:20:32,680
Last challenger is

663
00:20:32,680 --> 00:20:34,680
Matsumoto

664
00:20:34,680 --> 00:20:35,780
I'm last

665
00:20:35,780 --> 00:20:36,980
Here, it starts to become a psychological battle

666
00:20:36,980 --> 00:20:40,150
Here, it starts to become a psychological battle

667
00:20:41,000 --> 00:20:42,770
Man they're being

668
00:20:42,790 --> 00:20:45,960
so quiet it's creepy

669
00:20:46,340 --> 00:20:50,370
But this must be tough for them to choose one

670
00:20:52,530 --> 00:20:55,530
Seriously, the rubber is going to leave a mark on my face

671
00:20:57,050 --> 00:21:01,510
And finally, after choosing carefully, the most standard one...

672
00:21:01,970 --> 00:21:04,370
Kagome tomato juice!

673
00:21:04,370 --> 00:21:08,080
It's been loved and sold for a long time

674
00:21:08,080 --> 00:21:11,280
This taste, will he be able to remember it?

675
00:21:13,220 --> 00:21:17,340
Oh man, this is tomato-ey, like way more than I was expecting

676
00:21:20,850 --> 00:21:22,620
He slurped...

677
00:21:24,450 --> 00:21:27,060
It's a bit thick...

678
00:21:27,060 --> 00:21:27,970
I got to remember this gooey feeling

679
00:21:27,970 --> 00:21:30,800
I got to remember this gooey feeling

680
00:21:30,800 --> 00:21:32,500
It's like Hamada's house,this gooey-ness

681
00:21:32,500 --> 00:21:35,510
It's like Hamada's house this gooey-ness

682
00:21:35,510 --> 00:21:37,710
Do you want to get smacked?

683
00:21:40,050 --> 00:21:42,600
He's really defending himself...

684
00:21:42,970 --> 00:21:45,980
This is like really, and I always say this

685
00:21:45,980 --> 00:21:49,050
Why I hate going last is because

686
00:21:47,380 --> 00:21:49,050
it's like a psychological battle, isn't it.

687
00:21:49,250 --> 00:21:54,600
It's not about taste but more about having to guess what you guys will choose

688
00:21:54,650 --> 00:21:55,590
It's like

689
00:21:55,590 --> 00:21:59,600
Members

690
00:21:56,660 --> 00:21:59,600
feelings guessing game

691
00:21:59,600 --> 00:22:03,330
Just hurry up and drink

692
00:22:04,600 --> 00:22:05,940
But you know

693
00:22:05,940 --> 00:22:07,470

00:22:12,910 --> 00:22:13,480
