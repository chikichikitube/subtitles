00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,870
Subbed by RAIDEN1017

2
00:00:23,250 --> 00:00:29,290
This time the participating comedian knows who the other five participants are.

3
00:00:29,290 --> 00:00:36,300
Usually, they do not know who the other contestants are.
Do the contestants change the jokes they prepare or their stance compared to when they don't know who is coming?

4
00:00:36,300 --> 00:00:39,270
I don't think they change it.

5
00:00:40,500 --> 00:00:44,270
I think they have to do what they want to do.

6
00:00:44,270 --> 00:00:45,310
You lost weight.

7
00:00:46,940 --> 00:00:48,810
I am still fatter than Arisa Mizuki.

8
00:00:49,210 --> 00:00:51,450
Why are you comparing her to you?

9
00:00:54,120 --> 00:00:55,920
You lost weight and became prettier.

10
00:00:57,020 --> 00:01:02,020
If I were a contestant, I would think of a way to attack Zakoshi.

11
00:01:02,490 --> 00:01:03,830
Do you want me to apologize!?

12
00:01:03,830 --> 00:01:04,430
No.

13
00:01:05,130 --> 00:01:09,730
IIIIIIIIIIIIIIII'M SOOOOOOOOOO

14
00:01:09,730 --> 00:01:10,900
Exaggerated Desuyo.

15
00:01:11,830 --> 00:01:14,870
RYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYY.

16
00:01:16,070 --> 00:01:18,710
Cookie is so close!

17
00:01:18,740 --> 00:01:19,910
This move is very funny.

18
00:01:20,280 --> 00:01:24,550
I can't imagine Zakoshi laughing out loud at all.

19
00:01:25,610 --> 00:01:30,220
I want to destroy the image people have of him

20
00:02:32,210 --> 00:02:35,380
Documental - Season 10
Episode 2 “Therefor They are Strong”

21
00:02:42,820 --> 00:02:43,830
That's just violence!

22
00:02:45,730 --> 00:02:46,260
Are you okay?

23
00:02:46,790 --> 00:02:47,330
Yuriyan!?

24
00:02:47,400 --> 00:02:48,800
Oh, shit!
Are you okay?

25
00:02:49,160 --> 00:02:49,930
Are you okay, Yuriyan?

26
00:02:51,330 --> 00:02:52,400
Don't touch her boobs.

27
00:02:53,570 --> 00:02:54,770
Don't touch her boobs.

28
00:02:56,600 --> 00:02:57,570
Yamamoto laughed.

29
00:02:58,170 --> 00:02:58,810
Yamamoto laughed?

30
00:02:59,840 --> 00:03:01,280
Yamamoto-san laughed.

31
00:03:01,280 --> 00:03:02,510
Of course, it's a yellow card.

32
00:03:03,140 --> 00:03:04,150
I understood.

33
00:03:10,450 --> 00:03:12,850
- That was early.
- Yeah.

34
00:03:12,850 --> 00:03:19,130
Yeah, it was very early.
Okay, I got really mad.

35
00:03:19,130 --> 00:03:24,100
Yamamoto was under a lot of fire.
I felt sorry for him.

36
00:03:24,100 --> 00:03:26,030
They may change their point of attack.

37
00:03:26,030 --> 00:03:27,740
I will restart.

38
00:03:30,770 --> 00:03:35,640
Excuse me, if you are not a pedophile, please prove it.

39
00:03:36,810 --> 00:03:38,410
Do I have to do something again?

40
00:03:38,410 --> 00:03:39,550
Are they going to attack Yamamoto again?

41
00:03:40,150 --> 00:03:41,020
Prove it.

42
00:03:41,350 --> 00:03:42,520
Please prove it.

43
00:03:42,920 --> 00:03:43,890
Come here.

44
00:03:53,190 --> 00:03:55,660
- He's like a fat Akira Nishikino.
- Indeed.
(Note: 1)

45
00:03:55,660 --> 00:03:57,030
How do you like it?

46
00:03:57,930 --> 00:03:59,670
I don't think anything of it.

47
00:04:01,970 --> 00:04:03,040
How rude.

48
00:04:04,670 --> 00:04:05,270
Again?

49
00:04:05,710 --> 00:04:08,210
That's too much.

50
00:04:12,550 --> 00:04:13,780
Don't do that!

51
00:04:15,080 --> 00:04:15,620
You don't!

52
00:04:16,120 --> 00:04:18,790
You have bloodshot eyes.

53
00:04:19,690 --> 00:04:21,560
- What?
- Your eyes are bloodshot.

54
00:04:21,860 --> 00:04:23,590
What's going on here?

55
00:04:23,890 --> 00:04:25,030
It's as stiff as a rock dude!

56
00:04:25,030 --> 00:04:27,100
You got an erection?

57
00:04:27,100 --> 00:04:28,100
It's as stiff as a rock!

58
00:04:28,100 --> 00:04:29,200
What's stiff as a rock?

59
00:04:29,200 --> 00:04:30,200
His dick.

60
00:04:30,200 --> 00:04:31,030
What's with the bruise?

61
00:04:31,030 --> 00:04:32,170
My bruise has nothing to do with this.

62
00:04:32,170 --> 00:04:33,770
What are you doing?

63
00:04:34,370 --> 00:04:35,340
And you have an erection.

64
00:04:35,340 --> 00:04:36,500
Your dick's as stiff as a rock!

65
00:04:37,170 --> 00:04:38,340
What do you want?

66
00:04:38,340 --> 00:04:39,510
You don't say that!

67
00:04:40,240 --> 00:04:41,310
I feel sorry for Yuriyan.

68
00:04:41,310 --> 00:04:42,640
Come here.
He's dangerous.

69
00:04:48,080 --> 00:04:49,220
Don't touch her boobs.

70
00:04:53,860 --> 00:04:56,220
I would've laughed at that.

71
00:04:58,360 --> 00:05:00,400
It sounds like a beast.

72
00:05:01,760 --> 00:05:04,300
I would definitely laugh.

73
00:05:10,040 --> 00:05:11,570
Her nipples were stiff.

74
00:05:11,610 --> 00:05:12,570
Really?

75
00:05:14,080 --> 00:05:15,610
It was like a gravel stone in a shrine.

76
00:05:16,340 --> 00:05:18,250
Don't touch her nipples.

77
00:05:18,510 --> 00:05:23,580
I don't know if a junior like me is allowed to say this, but you should go to the bathroom with him.

78
00:05:24,290 --> 00:05:25,550
I'll give you my condom.

79
00:05:26,490 --> 00:05:27,420
- Are you sure?
- Yeah.

80
00:05:28,790 --> 00:05:30,090
It's 7.34mm.

81
00:05:31,830 --> 00:05:32,630
Kubota!

82
00:05:32,630 --> 00:05:34,100
Isn't it thick?

83
00:05:34,100 --> 00:05:35,360
It's very thick.

84
00:05:36,000 --> 00:05:37,500
It's usually less than 1mm.

85
00:05:37,500 --> 00:05:38,300
If you put it on, it will look like this.

86
00:05:38,370 --> 00:05:41,040
7mm is very thick.

87
00:05:41,040 --> 00:05:42,170
- Can I open it?
- Of course.

88
00:05:42,170 --> 00:05:43,370
I've never seen anything like this.

89
00:05:43,370 --> 00:05:44,610
It's as thick as squid skin, isn't it?

90
00:05:44,610 --> 00:05:45,670
Squid skin!?

91
00:05:45,970 --> 00:05:47,610
What the heck is this package?

92
00:05:48,010 --> 00:05:48,810
It's gold.

93
00:05:49,580 --> 00:05:52,450
This is a condom exclusively for Yamamoto-san.

94
00:05:53,310 --> 00:05:54,120
Does it cover the balls too?

95
00:05:54,550 --> 00:05:57,990
This has two separate tips.

96
00:05:57,990 --> 00:05:59,320
It's like a two-headed snake.

97
00:06:01,560 --> 00:06:02,460
Is his separated?

98
00:06:02,460 --> 00:06:03,790
His must have two separate urethra.

99
00:06:05,590 --> 00:06:07,100
It looks like a two-headed monster.

100
00:06:09,260 --> 00:06:11,970
So why don't you guys do it in the bathroom?

101
00:06:11,970 --> 00:06:13,270
That's what bathrooms are for, right?

102
00:06:13,270 --> 00:06:15,300
- That's right.
- It's for having sex.

103
00:06:16,340 --> 00:06:18,340
Also, it's for Watabe.
(Note: 2)

104
00:06:19,010 --> 00:06:20,310
- Watabe?
- Watabe?

105
00:06:23,710 --> 00:06:24,650
Yuri-chan, who do you want to have sex with?

106
00:06:25,180 --> 00:06:28,680
Which one shall I choose?

107
00:06:30,120 --> 00:06:31,820
Yamamoto-san, please take your condom.

108
00:06:35,160 --> 00:06:35,790
I ripped this.

109
00:06:35,820 --> 00:06:37,020
Hey, this one ripped.

110
00:06:37,260 --> 00:06:38,560
This isn't thick at all.

111
00:06:38,860 --> 00:06:40,800
So you can make a baby with it.

112
00:06:40,800 --> 00:06:41,660
This doesn't make me feel safe.

113
00:06:41,830 --> 00:06:42,700
Sorry.

114
00:06:43,230 --> 00:06:44,430
This is so weak.

115
00:06:45,430 --> 00:06:47,200
Why did you bring this?

116
00:06:47,600 --> 00:06:48,770
It doesn't matter.

117
00:06:49,540 --> 00:06:53,880
The other day I found a 0.01mm condom in Yuriyan's bag.
(Note: 3)

118
00:06:54,380 --> 00:06:55,940
That's why I brought mine.

119
00:06:55,940 --> 00:06:57,710
- You have a condom, too, right?
- Yes.

120
00:06:57,710 --> 00:06:59,080
- 0.01mm?
- Yes.

121
00:06:59,180 --> 00:07:00,250
Do you like the thinner ones?

122
00:07:00,350 --> 00:07:02,220
I really prefer 0.00 mm.

123
00:07:02,320 --> 00:07:03,790
That's the same as not wearing anything.

124
00:07:04,390 --> 00:07:05,650
Have you ever had sex?

125
00:07:05,720 --> 00:07:06,690
- Yes, I have!
- No, you haven't!

126
00:07:06,690 --> 00:07:07,720
- I have!
- Don't get excited.

127
00:07:07,890 --> 00:07:08,460
I have!

128
00:07:09,120 --> 00:07:09,990
0.00 mm...

129
00:07:10,690 --> 00:07:12,660
Don't do tsukkomi at the right time because I would laugh.

130
00:07:12,790 --> 00:07:13,690
Should I not do this?

131
00:07:13,690 --> 00:07:14,560
Yeah.

132
00:07:14,560 --> 00:07:17,670
It is not right to tell me not to do tsukkomi.

133
00:07:19,770 --> 00:07:21,340
Everyone is a boke.

134
00:07:21,340 --> 00:07:24,040
Then I'll do an exaggerated Boru-juku.
(Note: 4)

135
00:07:24,040 --> 00:07:26,170
He's going to do it suddenly?

136
00:07:27,780 --> 00:07:30,010
"Maaaneee."
(Kind of.)

137
00:07:30,010 --> 00:07:31,010
That's different, though.

138
00:07:31,380 --> 00:07:33,610
This is the normal one.
And this is the exaggerated Boru-juku.

139
00:07:42,360 --> 00:07:43,390
Maanee Tigers?

140
00:07:43,560 --> 00:07:44,860
Desane.
(Note: 5)

141
00:07:44,860 --> 00:07:47,600
I wanted you to do it naked.

142
00:07:47,600 --> 00:07:49,800
It would definitely be more funny that way.

143
00:07:49,800 --> 00:07:52,330
If you were wearing clothes, it wouldn't be funny at all.

144
00:07:52,330 --> 00:07:53,500
Really?
I'm going to go change.

145
00:07:53,500 --> 00:07:55,470
You're zero fun when you're wearing clothes.

146
00:07:56,700 --> 00:07:58,570
You're really not funny when you're wearing clothes.

147
00:07:59,410 --> 00:08:00,270
Don't...

148
00:08:00,270 --> 00:08:01,780
He laughed!

149
00:08:02,340 --> 00:08:03,980
He definitely laughed.

150
00:08:04,610 --> 00:08:06,010
Even though he attacked on his own.

151
00:08:06,750 --> 00:08:08,120
He blew himself up.

152
00:08:10,150 --> 00:08:11,490
He laughed at the accident.

153
00:08:11,750 --> 00:08:12,690
It's an accident.

154
00:08:12,690 --> 00:08:14,260
It's a rule of nature.

155
00:08:14,890 --> 00:08:16,320
A rule of nature?

156
00:08:19,690 --> 00:08:24,200
How weak I am. How weak I am...

157
00:08:24,200 --> 00:08:26,430
It was an accident!

158
00:08:26,800 --> 00:08:28,300
You all know who laughed.

159
00:08:28,300 --> 00:08:29,470
It was an accident!

160
00:08:29,470 --> 00:08:30,670
- Coo-chan!
- Yes...

161
00:08:31,340 --> 00:08:32,770
You smiled.

162
00:08:32,770 --> 00:08:33,640
It was an accident...

163
00:08:33,640 --> 00:08:35,040
You smiled.

164
00:08:56,200 --> 00:08:57,900
Why did you laugh?

165
00:08:57,900 --> 00:08:59,230
Why is that?

166
00:08:59,230 --> 00:09:01,070
Because I heard that sound unexpectedly and laughed.

167
00:09:01,070 --> 00:09:03,440
You were relaxed, like you were at home?

168
00:09:03,440 --> 00:09:05,940
I laugh easily at unexpected things.

169
00:09:07,070 --> 00:09:10,280
Yellow card.
Be careful of the unexpected.

170
00:09:13,080 --> 00:09:16,950
Shisho, you make a lot of unexpected jokes.
You drop things suddenly.

171
00:09:17,180 --> 00:09:19,990
When I do jokes normally, they don't laugh because they're so defensive.

172
00:09:19,990 --> 00:09:22,190
That was very funny when the condom was on your hat.

173
00:09:22,190 --> 00:09:25,760
- That was hilarious!
- That was insane!

174
00:09:27,460 --> 00:09:28,800
It's tough.

175
00:09:28,800 --> 00:09:30,160
Sorry, Yamamoto-san.

176
00:09:30,500 --> 00:09:31,570
Here we go.

177
00:09:40,110 --> 00:09:41,780
That's a lot of baggage.

178
00:09:41,940 --> 00:09:43,640
I don't know whose luggage any of this is.

179
00:09:44,480 --> 00:09:46,150
Let's clean it out.

180
00:09:46,150 --> 00:09:48,880
Yes, let's do so.

181
00:09:50,450 --> 00:09:52,120
Yuri-chan, I'm sorry I touched your boobs.

182
00:09:52,120 --> 00:09:53,790
It made me happy.

183
00:09:53,890 --> 00:09:55,060
- Huh?
- It made me happy.

184
00:09:55,060 --> 00:09:56,820
Really? Then I'm glad.

185
00:09:57,690 --> 00:09:59,360
- Seriously, yours were soft.
- Thank you.

186
00:10:00,190 --> 00:10:01,760
Was mine soft?

187
00:10:02,230 --> 00:10:04,730
It was firm.

188
00:10:05,230 --> 00:10:06,630
Yuliyan's was firm, wasn't it?

189
00:10:06,630 --> 00:10:08,770
She was wearing a bra and hers were small.

190
00:10:08,800 --> 00:10:10,940
She forced me to touch her boobs.

191
00:10:13,570 --> 00:10:16,140
Don't say to a woman that your boobs are small.

192
00:10:16,140 --> 00:10:26,190
No, I was just answering her question.

193
00:10:26,190 --> 00:10:33,860
- By the way, after the red light comes on, it's safe time, right?
- That guy's lighter is huge.

194
00:10:33,860 --> 00:10:38,030
It's not good to apologize to someone at that time.

195
00:10:38,230 --> 00:10:40,230
I don't think we should talk about that kind of backstage stuff.

196
00:10:40,230 --> 00:10:41,670
You say that, too.

197
00:10:41,670 --> 00:10:43,370
Don't call me you, call me Cookie.

198
00:10:44,310 --> 00:10:45,470
Kawashima.

199
00:10:46,040 --> 00:10:47,910
Don't call me by old name, Yamamoto.

200
00:10:50,610 --> 00:10:51,410
So Yuriyan...

201
00:10:51,410 --> 00:10:53,050
Don't point the finger at me.

202
00:10:53,310 --> 00:10:55,320
Didn't you learn in school not to point fingers at people?

203
00:10:56,350 --> 00:10:57,750
Don't apologize...

204
00:10:58,250 --> 00:10:59,590
They want him out?

205
00:11:00,990 --> 00:11:03,860
Because if you apologize...

206
00:11:03,860 --> 00:11:06,590
Don't talk with a broom, you look like a monk.

207
00:11:07,190 --> 00:11:08,100
Oh, monk.

208
00:11:08,100 --> 00:11:09,860
Come to think of it, you tried to become a monk once, didn't you?

209
00:11:10,400 --> 00:11:12,370
And you ran away from the temple in the middle of your training, right?
(Note: 6)

210
00:11:12,370 --> 00:11:13,830
Something like that did happen.

211
00:11:14,270 --> 00:11:15,700
Chairman Osaki was angry with you.

212
00:11:18,440 --> 00:11:19,240
Was he angry?

213
00:11:19,240 --> 00:11:20,210
President Okamoto too.
(Note: 7)

214
00:11:21,510 --> 00:11:24,480
Hey, Yamamoto!
What's wrong?

215
00:11:25,050 --> 00:11:26,280
How long are you going to keep sweeping?

216
00:11:27,450 --> 00:11:29,580
He's under heavy fire.

217
00:11:29,580 --> 00:11:32,390
Yamamoto, laugh two more times and get out of here.

218
00:11:35,490 --> 00:11:36,560
What the fuck is this!?

219
00:11:36,560 --> 00:11:37,690
Shouting much?

220
00:11:37,690 --> 00:11:38,890
What's with this fucking vibe!?

221
00:11:39,490 --> 00:11:41,000
What's with this fucking vibe!?

222
00:11:48,870 --> 00:11:50,200
Yamamoto-san, don't...

223
00:11:50,200 --> 00:11:51,170
What a small hat!

224
00:11:52,070 --> 00:11:54,380
How small.

225
00:11:55,240 --> 00:11:56,710
Your head got bigger?

226
00:11:56,710 --> 00:11:58,610
Is your hat small?
Or is your body bigger?

227
00:11:59,310 --> 00:12:00,750
- My body is big.
- Really?

228
00:12:00,880 --> 00:12:02,380
That's cute.

229
00:12:03,280 --> 00:12:04,420
- It's small.
- huh?

230
00:12:04,450 --> 00:12:05,620
- It's small.
- Really?

231
00:12:06,190 --> 00:12:06,920
It is about this size.

232
00:12:07,620 --> 00:12:09,190
- It is about this size.
- Huh?

233
00:12:09,190 --> 00:12:10,560
- It is about this size.
- Really?

234
00:12:11,160 --> 00:12:15,060
What's that hat for?
Where did you buy it?

235
00:12:16,360 --> 00:12:17,130
Huh?

236
00:12:17,130 --> 00:12:18,600
I know you heard him.

237
00:12:19,000 --> 00:12:20,770
I don't have to answer that!

238
00:12:21,970 --> 00:12:23,470
You shouldn't say that...

239
00:12:24,140 --> 00:12:25,540
You don't have to answer that?

240
00:12:25,910 --> 00:12:27,540
Okay, I'll answer.

241
00:12:28,480 --> 00:12:29,340
I ordered this.

242
00:12:31,650 --> 00:12:32,750
I ordered this.

243
00:12:33,080 --> 00:12:34,050
I see.

244
00:12:34,380 --> 00:12:35,350
I thought this would make you laugh.

245
00:12:36,020 --> 00:12:36,980
It was funny.

246
00:12:39,620 --> 00:12:40,790
Would you all like something to drink?

247
00:12:40,790 --> 00:12:42,490
Ah, drink.
I'm thirsty.

248
00:12:42,490 --> 00:12:44,530
There were several kinds of that.

249
00:12:44,530 --> 00:12:45,930
I'm thirsty.

250
00:12:45,930 --> 00:12:49,200
Soda, green tea, oolong tea, water, coffee.

251
00:12:49,200 --> 00:12:50,430
I want a soda.

252
00:12:50,430 --> 00:12:52,870
Apple juice, orange juice, and alcohol.

253
00:12:52,870 --> 00:12:53,900
Oh, is there beer?

254
00:12:53,900 --> 00:12:55,170
Is there alcohol?

255
00:12:56,100 --> 00:12:57,170
And some eggs.

256
00:12:57,970 --> 00:12:59,110
Are there eggs too?

257
00:12:59,110 --> 00:13:00,040
Nobody wants this?

258
00:13:00,210 --> 00:13:01,310
- Why don't you eat that?
- Okay.

259
00:13:01,440 --> 00:13:02,340
Do you drink eggs?

260
00:13:04,080 --> 00:13:05,910
You ate it in the shell.

261
00:13:05,910 --> 00:13:06,750
Can you eat it in the shell?

262
00:13:06,750 --> 00:13:07,820
Can you swallow it?

263
00:13:09,780 --> 00:13:10,350
Swallow it.

264
00:13:10,350 --> 00:13:11,620
The shell is sticking to my throat.

265
00:13:12,890 --> 00:13:13,850
He can't eat raw food.

266
00:13:17,560 --> 00:13:20,860
He can't eat any raw food!
Come on!

267
00:13:20,860 --> 00:13:21,700
Are you okay?

268
00:13:22,560 --> 00:13:24,830
Yuri-chan, did you see that?
Comedy is patience.

269
00:13:25,830 --> 00:13:27,130
"Comedy is patience."

270
00:13:27,130 --> 00:13:28,200
Orekara Manabe
(Learn it from me.)

271
00:13:28,200 --> 00:13:29,470
Yes.

272
00:13:29,470 --> 00:13:31,010
I'm Kaori Manabe.
(Note: 8)

273
00:13:31,310 --> 00:13:32,210
Oh, nice!

274
00:13:32,940 --> 00:13:35,040
She says any kind of nonsense, doesn't she?

275
00:13:35,940 --> 00:13:38,280
Excuse me, can you hold these?

276
00:13:39,180 --> 00:13:42,750
Please put these on my shoulders one by one.
I will crack them between my face and shoulder.

277
00:13:43,750 --> 00:13:45,620
- I want to see it!
- Wait a second.

278
00:13:47,050 --> 00:13:48,490
Please put them around here.

279
00:13:48,490 --> 00:13:49,260
- Are you ready?
- Yes.

280
00:13:49,260 --> 00:13:51,030
Your mole has hairs.

281
00:13:51,030 --> 00:13:52,830
Everybody, come here.

282
00:13:53,430 --> 00:13:55,200
Sorry, hold on a second.

283
00:13:58,230 --> 00:13:59,770
Oh, two hairs grow here!

284
00:14:01,440 --> 00:14:05,210
No, one hair has a branch growing out of it!

285
00:14:05,210 --> 00:14:06,770
Ichi no eda?
(A branch?)

286
00:14:07,240 --> 00:14:08,110
This is unusual.

287
00:14:08,110 --> 00:14:09,010
Ichinoeda-san?

288
00:14:09,040 --> 00:14:10,010
Are you Ichinoeda-san?

289
00:14:10,010 --> 00:14:10,810
I'm not Ichinoeda.

290
00:14:10,810 --> 00:14:13,610
- Ichinoeda?
- Ichinoeda?

291
00:14:13,880 --> 00:14:16,020
Inazo Nitobe also has a hair here.
(Note: 9)

292
00:14:16,020 --> 00:14:17,380
- Are you growing your hair?
- Yes.

293
00:14:17,890 --> 00:14:18,990
Ichinoeda-san.

294
00:14:19,790 --> 00:14:20,620
...Then, please put it here.

295
00:14:21,020 --> 00:14:22,960
I can't look at your mole.

296
00:14:23,420 --> 00:14:24,260
You can't?

297
00:14:24,260 --> 00:14:25,930
So Kotouge do this.

298
00:14:27,030 --> 00:14:28,130
How can I do that?

299
00:14:28,130 --> 00:14:29,730
Every time you place it on my shoulder I will crack it.

300
00:14:29,730 --> 00:14:31,130
We don't need three people for this.

301
00:14:31,130 --> 00:14:32,430
Let's do it in a streamlined way.

302
00:14:32,500 --> 00:14:33,230
I will help you.

303
00:14:35,270 --> 00:14:36,140
Am I to place this here?

304
00:14:36,140 --> 00:14:38,310
I want to crack them one by one.

305
00:14:39,340 --> 00:14:42,510
Don't suddenly place them on the other side.

306
00:14:42,510 --> 00:14:45,380
So if you place this here, I....

307
00:14:45,380 --> 00:14:46,450
I know!!

308
00:14:46,650 --> 00:14:47,820
What do I do with this?

309
00:14:48,280 --> 00:14:51,790
Please hold this.

310
00:14:51,790 --> 00:14:53,620
Coo is so close!

311
00:14:53,620 --> 00:14:55,320
He was about to laugh now.

312
00:14:56,260 --> 00:14:57,360
It fell out.

313
00:14:57,360 --> 00:14:58,090
I'm done.

314
00:14:58,090 --> 00:14:59,630
There are still some left.

315
00:15:02,600 --> 00:15:03,660
You haven't cracked a single one.

316
00:15:03,660 --> 00:15:05,500
You're weak today.

317
00:15:08,940 --> 00:15:10,240
You didn't crack any of these.

318
00:15:10,240 --> 00:15:11,310
Good Morning it's Sun.
(Note: 10)

319
00:15:11,810 --> 00:15:13,070
Good evening.

320
00:15:13,070 --> 00:15:14,240
Good evening.

321
00:15:14,780 --> 00:15:15,810
Good evening, Ichinoeda-san.

322
00:15:16,210 --> 00:15:17,710
Hi, I'm Ichinoeda.

323
00:15:19,150 --> 00:15:20,410
Hello!

324
00:15:20,450 --> 00:15:21,720
Good Morning it's Sun.

325
00:15:25,590 --> 00:15:26,750
He's laughing.

326
00:15:36,930 --> 00:15:37,930
You're a fool.

327
00:15:37,930 --> 00:15:38,930
How foolish.

328
00:15:39,230 --> 00:15:40,330
How foolish.

329
00:15:40,330 --> 00:15:42,340
Don't laugh after egging yourself on.

330
00:15:43,170 --> 00:15:44,510
It's a foolish thing to do.

331
00:15:45,540 --> 00:15:46,270
You're bleeding.

332
00:15:46,340 --> 00:15:47,010
Really?

333
00:15:47,110 --> 00:15:47,680
Really?

334
00:15:47,680 --> 00:15:48,440
It's okay.

335
00:15:49,910 --> 00:15:50,610
You're bleeding.

336
00:15:50,610 --> 00:15:53,310
I didn't mean to laugh.
I don't know, maybe I'm embarrassed.

337
00:15:53,310 --> 00:15:58,250
I didn't mean to laugh.
I don't know, maybe I'm embarrassed.

338
00:15:58,250 --> 00:16:00,150
That's why I smirked.

339
00:16:00,150 --> 00:16:01,560
I'll watch the replay and judge.

340
00:16:01,560 --> 00:16:03,420
I can't judge yet.

341
00:16:11,100 --> 00:16:12,930
You just laughed.

342
00:16:14,030 --> 00:16:14,940
You laughed.

343
00:16:14,940 --> 00:16:16,640
You just laughed and bled.

344
00:16:17,810 --> 00:16:19,870
You laughed and bled.

345
00:16:22,210 --> 00:16:23,380
I was caught off guard.

346
00:16:24,110 --> 00:16:25,550
- I was caught off guard.
- Yeah.

347
00:16:25,550 --> 00:16:26,880
Because it's fun.

348
00:16:27,410 --> 00:16:28,550
Yellow card.

349
00:16:28,550 --> 00:16:29,550
Yeah, it's fun.

350
00:16:29,550 --> 00:16:31,150
Be careful.

351
00:16:31,150 --> 00:16:31,950
Good luck.

352
00:16:32,850 --> 00:16:34,320
Thank you!

353
00:16:34,320 --> 00:16:35,260
Good luck.

354
00:16:35,260 --> 00:16:38,190
Don't show me that mole.

355
00:16:38,290 --> 00:16:39,390
Why are there two hairs on it?

356
00:16:39,390 --> 00:16:43,500
If I see that unexpectedly I would laugh at it.

357
00:16:47,600 --> 00:16:49,540
What were you guys doing?

358
00:16:49,670 --> 00:16:51,340
Here we go.

359
00:16:54,010 --> 00:16:55,040
What were you guys doing?

360
00:16:55,040 --> 00:16:59,180
We were egging each other on.
Then Kotouge laughed.

361
00:16:59,510 --> 00:17:00,180
I messed up!

362
00:17:03,020 --> 00:17:04,720
I'm growing this hair.

363
00:17:05,620 --> 00:17:07,290
I heard I shouldn't pull it out.

364
00:17:07,290 --> 00:17:09,620
- I want to pull it out.
- Let's pull it out.

365
00:17:09,620 --> 00:17:11,130
If you pull it out, I'll go crazy.

366
00:17:11,130 --> 00:17:13,290
- What happens to you when I pull it out?
- I have never pulled it out.

367
00:17:13,290 --> 00:17:14,660
I've been growing it.

368
00:17:15,000 --> 00:17:19,600
This hair has been growing since I won M-1.
And I've got another one.

369
00:17:20,200 --> 00:17:21,470
- After M-1?
- Yes.

370
00:17:21,470 --> 00:17:23,100
Then this hair is Murata's.
(Note: 11)

371
00:17:23,100 --> 00:17:25,410
- Give that to Murata.
- Who's that? I don’t know.

372
00:17:25,970 --> 00:17:27,240
He's your buddy.

373
00:17:30,340 --> 00:17:31,280
You look like him.

374
00:17:31,310 --> 00:17:33,380
- You look so much like him.
- Yeah.

375
00:17:33,510 --> 00:17:34,450
I'm not as fat as he is.

376
00:17:35,320 --> 00:17:36,980
Please line up beside him.

377
00:17:37,480 --> 00:17:38,690
He looks so much like him.

378
00:17:38,990 --> 00:17:40,190
Don't get on the podium.

379
00:17:40,890 --> 00:17:43,190
If you get on the podium, you won't be able to line up.

380
00:17:45,230 --> 00:17:47,490
Why are you standing here?

381
00:17:47,690 --> 00:17:50,560
You can stand in third place or first place, whichever you like.

382
00:17:50,560 --> 00:17:51,970
Okay, first place.

383
00:17:51,970 --> 00:17:53,600
They really look alike.

384
00:17:53,600 --> 00:17:54,970
Yamamoto-san is fatter than Zakoshi-san.

385
00:17:55,770 --> 00:17:56,700
You are too fat.

386
00:17:56,700 --> 00:17:57,910
I don't like his fatness.

387
00:17:57,910 --> 00:18:00,640
Can you do an exaggerated impression?

388
00:18:00,640 --> 00:18:02,410
- What?
- Can you do an exaggerated impression?

389
00:18:02,610 --> 00:18:03,940
- Of course.
- Do it.

390
00:18:04,750 --> 00:18:05,650
Shall I do it first?

391
00:18:06,210 --> 00:18:07,750
- Okay.
- Then I'll do it first.

392
00:18:07,920 --> 00:18:09,320
First, show me your normal impression.

393
00:18:09,320 --> 00:18:15,620
Zakoshi, show me a normal impression without exaggeration.

394
00:18:15,620 --> 00:18:17,190
Okay, normal one.

395
00:18:17,190 --> 00:18:20,060
Then, this is normal Zakiyama.
(Note: 12)

396
00:18:20,330 --> 00:18:22,460
"Kuruuuu."
(Comiiiing.)

397
00:18:22,630 --> 00:18:24,730
Then, try an exaggerated Zakiyama.

398
00:18:26,830 --> 00:18:28,970
KUUUUUU

399
00:18:29,170 --> 00:18:31,770
RUUUUUU

400
00:18:43,620 --> 00:18:45,450
That's different.

401
00:18:45,450 --> 00:18:46,950
Then show me the real one.

402
00:18:46,950 --> 00:18:47,860
Real one?

403
00:18:56,700 --> 00:18:58,130
How can they stand it without laughing?

404
00:18:58,170 --> 00:18:58,900
Really so.

405
00:18:59,830 --> 00:19:01,200
Are you Zakiyama-san?

406
00:19:44,610 --> 00:19:46,950
That's nice, I want to try that too.

407
00:19:46,950 --> 00:19:48,020
Go ahead.

408
00:19:58,760 --> 00:20:01,260
Coo and Kubota.

409
00:20:01,260 --> 00:20:02,630
They are close.

410
00:20:05,330 --> 00:20:06,300
She stopped.

411
00:20:06,770 --> 00:20:07,430
I found it.

412
00:20:07,430 --> 00:20:09,140
Zakoshi is close too.

413
00:20:09,670 --> 00:20:10,700
I dress differently than you.

414
00:20:10,700 --> 00:20:12,210
Right.

415
00:20:12,210 --> 00:20:13,710
But you are a woman.

416
00:20:13,710 --> 00:20:16,380
I can't let you dress like this.

417
00:20:16,740 --> 00:20:17,840
You can't do this.

418
00:20:18,050 --> 00:20:19,150
You can't do it, Retriever.

419
00:20:19,710 --> 00:20:21,820
Don't call her Retriever.
We call her Yuriyan.

420
00:20:22,620 --> 00:20:23,380
Lien.

421
00:20:23,680 --> 00:20:25,250
Don't say it like Shinsengumi.
(Note: 13)

422
00:20:25,590 --> 00:20:26,790
Who remembers that?

423
00:20:26,790 --> 00:20:27,550
I miss this.

424
00:20:27,550 --> 00:20:28,520
Who remembers that?

425
00:20:28,520 --> 00:20:29,060
Lien!

426
00:20:29,890 --> 00:20:31,230
Don't say it like Shinsengumi.

427
00:20:32,860 --> 00:20:33,830
Don't tsukkomi me.

428
00:20:34,700 --> 00:20:35,660
You want to say "What the hell"?

429
00:20:36,300 --> 00:20:36,930
"What the hell"

430
00:20:36,930 --> 00:20:37,730
"Hello"

431
00:20:37,730 --> 00:20:38,470
"We are..."

432
00:20:38,870 --> 00:20:40,830
Hello!

433
00:20:41,270 --> 00:20:42,670
We are Duo.
Nice to meet you.

434
00:20:42,840 --> 00:20:43,940
Duo?

435
00:20:44,270 --> 00:20:45,240
Is she all right?

436
00:20:51,480 --> 00:20:53,810
We are Tokyo Hoteison.
Nice to meet you.
(Note: 14)

437
00:20:53,810 --> 00:20:56,020
And, this is the exaggerated Tokyo Hoteison.

438
00:21:01,320 --> 00:21:02,020
Kotouge!

439
00:21:11,330 --> 00:21:12,030
What the hell.

440
00:21:13,070 --> 00:21:14,900
What's a Kachan?

441
00:21:14,900 --> 00:21:18,070
What's the exaggerated Kachan?

442
00:21:18,070 --> 00:21:18,970
This is Kabuki.
(Note: 15)

443
00:21:18,970 --> 00:21:19,910
What's a Kachan?

444
00:21:27,510 --> 00:21:28,920
So what's a Kachan!?

445
00:21:34,320 --> 00:21:35,690
What's a Kachan?

446
00:21:35,860 --> 00:21:36,790
This is Kabuki.

447
00:21:37,520 --> 00:21:39,490
It will be an hour in a few minutes.

448
00:21:39,490 --> 00:21:41,700
- You right!
- How fast!

449
00:21:41,960 --> 00:21:44,300
You guys don't laugh easily.

450
00:21:44,300 --> 00:21:45,570
Time goes by fast.

451
00:21:45,570 --> 00:21:46,600
Because we're the winners.

452
00:21:46,600 --> 00:21:48,970
Well, you guys are the winners, no doubt.

453
00:21:48,970 --> 00:21:52,910
Then, I'll do the exaggerated mayor of Nagoya city.
(Note: 16)

454
00:21:53,370 --> 00:21:54,980
Yuriyan is not here, but okay.

455
00:21:54,980 --> 00:21:56,140
He bit the medal.

456
00:21:56,380 --> 00:21:58,650
First, this is the normal mayor of Nagoya city.

457
00:21:58,650 --> 00:22:00,080
Where did you get that out of?

458
00:22:02,080 --> 00:22:03,380
It wasn't like that.

459
00:22:03,380 --> 00:22:04,450
This is entirely different!

460
00:22:05,220 --> 00:22:08,360
And this is the exaggerated mayor of Nagoya city.

461
00:22:13,190 --> 00:22:14,730
Desaanee.

462
00:22:15,160 --> 00:22:15,700
Go(su)!
(Note: 17)

463
00:22:15,830 --> 00:22:17,060
He didn't bite the medal.

464
00:22:17,100 --> 00:22:18,170
You burped.

465
00:22:18,330 --> 00:22:19,070
He said "Go".

466
00:22:19,070 --> 00:22:20,530
You burped at the end.

467
00:22:20,870 --> 00:22:21,500
You burped.

468
00:22:21,700 --> 00:22:22,340
This is not a burp.

469
00:22:22,670 --> 00:22:23,300
You said "Go".

470
00:22:23,500 --> 00:22:24,600
You ate the gold and burped.

471
00:22:25,740 --> 00:22:26,240
What's wrong?

472
00:22:26,240 --> 00:22:26,940
What are you doing?

473
00:22:28,140 --> 00:22:28,580
Don't do that.

474
00:22:29,080 --> 00:22:30,010
I'm wearing nothing but a shirt.

475
00:22:30,010 --> 00:22:30,810
Really?

476
00:22:30,810 --> 00:22:33,110
If you do that, we won't be able to stream this.

477
00:22:33,150 --> 00:22:35,720
You're wearing nothing but a shirt?
That's terrible.

478
00:22:35,720 --> 00:22:37,050
This is not shooting a porn video.

479
00:22:37,220 --> 00:22:39,420
- Then just show it to us.
- Why don't you take a peek?

480
00:22:39,850 --> 00:22:42,120
We have to decide if we can stream it or not.
So I'll take a peek.

481
00:22:42,290 --> 00:22:44,220
What's he going to do?

482
00:22:45,130 --> 00:22:46,590
- Then look at it.
- Okay.

483
00:22:46,730 --> 00:22:52,200
If I turn up your clothes and see you naked, I will be criticized.
So please open your legs.

484
00:22:52,200 --> 00:22:54,900
- I'll get on the skateboard and through between your legs.
- That's a nice idea!

485
00:22:55,340 --> 00:22:56,240
Are you okay?

486
00:22:57,040 --> 00:22:57,700
Can you do it?

487
00:22:57,700 --> 00:22:58,870
Then I'll try it.

488
00:22:59,440 --> 00:23:00,510
Okay, let's go!

489
00:23:00,870 --> 00:23:02,510
Here we go.

490
00:23:04,140 --> 00:23:04,810
How was it?

491
00:23:06,950 --> 00:23:07,680
What the fuck are you doing?

492
00:23:07,680 --> 00:23:08,480
How was it?

493
00:23:10,920 --> 00:23:12,520
I'm going back.

494
00:23:17,720 --> 00:23:18,690
What did you see?

495
00:23:18,860 --> 00:23:19,960
Wait a moment.

496
00:23:24,100 --> 00:23:25,230
Yuriyan, you are...

497
00:23:26,370 --> 00:23:27,670
You're a female comedian, right?

498
00:23:28,270 --> 00:23:29,340
Yes...

499
00:23:30,600 --> 00:23:32,540
Kotouge-san, you should see that too.

500
00:23:32,540 --> 00:23:33,940
I won't know unless you explain it to me properly.

501
00:23:33,940 --> 00:23:36,310
- What?
- What's going on?

502
00:23:38,350 --> 00:23:40,280
Tuck in your head.

503
00:23:40,280 --> 00:23:40,950
Ouch!

504
00:23:41,310 --> 00:23:42,250
Ow!

505
00:23:42,250 --> 00:23:45,490
Don't kick me with your toes!

506
00:23:45,550 --> 00:23:46,620
Pull your head back a little more.

507
00:23:46,950 --> 00:23:48,390
Don't move!

508
00:23:48,820 --> 00:23:49,460
Yes...

509
00:23:50,490 --> 00:23:51,430
- Take a good look at that.
- Yes.

510
00:23:51,590 --> 00:23:53,430
And explain it to us.

511
00:23:55,600 --> 00:23:56,330
Oops.

512
00:23:57,330 --> 00:23:58,400
Oops!

513
00:23:58,730 --> 00:23:59,530
Not good?

514
00:23:59,630 --> 00:24:05,610
-What did you think?
-I think they can manage to stream this one.

515
00:24:05,610 --> 00:24:07,010
I'm not sure either.

516
00:24:07,310 --> 00:24:09,340
Do you guys think we can stream this?

517
00:24:09,510 --> 00:24:11,340
I think we can do it.

518
00:24:11,580 --> 00:24:12,350
Let me see it.

519
00:24:12,850 --> 00:24:13,250
Yes.

520
00:24:15,380 --> 00:24:16,120
I see.

521
00:24:18,520 --> 00:24:19,750
This is how it looks inside!

522
00:24:21,090 --> 00:24:22,620
I was still in the middle of changing.

523
00:24:22,620 --> 00:24:23,720
I see.

524
00:24:24,620 --> 00:24:26,930
She had something on her hip.
Please turn around.

525
00:24:27,860 --> 00:24:29,200
Let me see.

526
00:24:29,200 --> 00:24:30,560
What is this?

527
00:24:30,560 --> 00:24:31,700
Yeah, I had no idea what this was.

528
00:24:31,700 --> 00:24:33,900
I was in the middle of putting them on.

529
00:24:34,270 --> 00:24:35,570
Is it beads?

530
00:24:35,900 --> 00:24:38,040
You want gold in your anus, not in your mouth, right?

531
00:24:38,040 --> 00:24:39,610
Did I look like I wanted to put gold in my anus?

532
00:24:39,970 --> 00:24:41,270
What are you saying?

533
00:24:43,210 --> 00:24:43,740
A gold...?

534
00:24:44,410 --> 00:24:46,210
What is this?

535
00:24:46,210 --> 00:24:47,350
What's that round thing?

536
00:24:47,510 --> 00:24:48,980
Hey, hey, hey, come on.

537
00:24:48,980 --> 00:24:50,580
Is that really in your anus?

538
00:24:51,790 --> 00:24:53,850
- You've been putting gold in your anus?
- That's teribble.

539
00:24:53,990 --> 00:24:55,020
It's a faucet.

540
00:24:55,020 --> 00:24:57,160
- A faucet?
- Ah, I see.

541
00:24:57,160 --> 00:24:59,130
It's a joke item.

542
00:24:59,130 --> 00:25:00,630
I was surprised.

543
00:25:00,630 --> 00:25:02,530
Don't be nervous about this.

544
00:25:02,530 --> 00:25:04,730
Oh, I remember that one.

545
00:25:04,730 --> 00:25:07,700
- what the hell does this remind you of
- He remembered something.

546
00:25:07,970 --> 00:25:10,070
But I'm relieved.
I was nervous.

547
00:25:10,070 --> 00:25:11,940
I was embarrassed too.

548
00:25:13,340 --> 00:25:16,910
OH, YEAH.
OH, YEAH.

549
00:25:17,280 --> 00:25:21,050
I'll do an exaggerated Akira 100%.
(Note: 18)

550
00:25:23,550 --> 00:25:26,150
"You guys are getting nervous, aren't you?"

551
00:25:26,790 --> 00:25:30,360
OH, YEAH.
OH, YEAH.

552
00:25:40,130 --> 00:25:41,870
This is the worst.

553
00:25:47,140 --> 00:25:49,110
She tied a string to it!

554
00:25:52,910 --> 00:25:53,880
This is the worst.

555
00:25:59,190 --> 00:26:00,490
Why did you take off your hat?

556
00:26:01,090 --> 00:26:01,990
CUT.

557
00:26:04,760 --> 00:26:06,060
Then I'll do the surgery.

558
00:26:06,160 --> 00:26:07,860
Excuse me, I'll do a simple surgery.

559
00:26:12,800 --> 00:26:13,400
Are you sure?

560
00:26:14,470 --> 00:26:15,840
I'll do a simple surgery.

561
00:26:16,140 --> 00:26:17,170
Sorry.

562
00:26:21,370 --> 00:26:22,480
Cool.

563
00:26:22,710 --> 00:26:23,740
Nice.

564
00:26:24,910 --> 00:26:26,310
This looks like a beetle larva.

565
00:26:31,650 --> 00:26:32,550
Oh, good.

566
00:26:33,520 --> 00:26:35,290
Oh, you look nice!

567
00:26:35,460 --> 00:26:37,360
Do the one you just did again.

568
00:26:37,360 --> 00:26:38,330
Again?

569
00:26:43,360 --> 00:26:45,200
Hey, it's not here!

570
00:26:46,370 --> 00:26:47,500
Not here!

571
00:26:47,630 --> 00:26:48,500
Kubota, watch out!

572
00:26:56,510 --> 00:26:57,240
Damn!

573
00:26:57,380 --> 00:26:58,240
It's not here.

574
00:27:00,810 --> 00:27:02,320
I blew myself up!

575
00:27:02,320 --> 00:27:04,150
Damn it!
I blew myself up!

576
00:27:04,150 --> 00:27:05,190
Even though you attacked me.

577
00:27:05,190 --> 00:27:06,350
I was having too much fun.

578
00:27:06,690 --> 00:27:08,050
I was having too much fun!

579
00:27:08,860 --> 00:27:10,120
Oh, I shouldn't have done it.

580
00:27:11,020 --> 00:27:11,990
How simple it is.

581
00:27:11,990 --> 00:27:15,630
This happens all the time.

582
00:27:16,300 --> 00:27:17,030
Kubota!

583
00:27:17,030 --> 00:27:18,060
Yes, I laughed.

584
00:27:18,060 --> 00:27:20,500
You attacked him yourself and you laughed.

585
00:27:20,500 --> 00:27:21,840
I laughed at the simplest things.

586
00:27:21,840 --> 00:27:25,810
Yeah.
Let's see the replay.

587
00:27:29,810 --> 00:27:31,750
This is funny.

588
00:27:42,520 --> 00:27:45,290
I'll give you the card this time.

589
00:27:46,690 --> 00:27:48,560
Damn it!
I blew myself up!

590
00:27:49,130 --> 00:27:50,100
Yellow card.

591
00:27:51,560 --> 00:27:53,230
Damn it!

592
00:27:53,230 --> 00:27:59,210
The cards began to be passed out to the group.

593
00:28:04,240 --> 00:28:05,850
It hasn't been an hour yet.

594
00:28:05,850 --> 00:28:07,710
Yeah.

595
00:28:08,950 --> 00:28:10,180
Here we go.

596
00:28:14,090 --> 00:28:16,220
I'll do this one, too.

597
00:28:16,420 --> 00:28:17,760
Yasumura-kun.

598
00:28:18,590 --> 00:28:19,760
This is the exaggerated Yasumura.
(Note: 19)

599
00:28:27,630 --> 00:28:30,300
"Don't worry, I'm wearing this."

600
00:28:30,400 --> 00:28:31,670
It's sticking out.

601
00:28:31,770 --> 00:28:33,040
But my chimbou is sticking out.
(Note: 20)

602
00:28:33,670 --> 00:28:34,910
I'm definitely worried.

603
00:28:35,140 --> 00:28:38,480
Don't worry, I'm wearing this.
But my chimbou is sticking out.

604
00:28:38,880 --> 00:28:40,110
That's not good enough.

605
00:28:40,180 --> 00:28:42,520
Don't worry, I'm wearing this.
But my chimbou is sticking out.

606
00:28:43,180 --> 00:28:44,420
Stop calling it chimbou.

607
00:28:44,420 --> 00:28:45,290
My chimbou is sticking out.

608
00:28:45,290 --> 00:28:46,320
Don't call it chimbo.

609
00:28:46,350 --> 00:28:48,090
How many times is this guy going to say chimbou?

610
00:28:49,320 --> 00:28:54,060
I wish that Zakoshishou-san's chimbou would come out more.

611
00:28:54,260 --> 00:28:54,990
Chimbou!

612
00:28:55,560 --> 00:28:56,530
Chinbou-kun?

613
00:28:58,830 --> 00:28:59,600
Chimbou!

614
00:29:00,230 --> 00:29:01,740
Welcome to chimbou.

615
00:29:01,840 --> 00:29:03,140
I AM CHIMBOU!

616
00:29:03,800 --> 00:29:05,370
Interpret: He is Chimbou.

617
00:29:05,410 --> 00:29:06,970
MY NAME IS CHIMBOU!

618
00:29:07,140 --> 00:29:11,610
Interpret: His name is Chimbou.
Chimbou is very important to him.

619
00:29:11,780 --> 00:29:13,650
CHIMBOU IS CHIMBOU!

620
00:29:13,880 --> 00:29:16,050
Interpret: Chimbou is chimbou as you know.

621
00:29:16,320 --> 00:29:18,020
CHIMBOU
OH YEAH CHIMBOU!

622
00:29:18,180 --> 00:29:20,890
Interpret: Chimbou is always watching over Africa from his underwear.

623
00:29:20,920 --> 00:29:22,890
CHIMBOU, OH, CHIMBOU!

624
00:29:22,990 --> 00:29:26,760
Interpret: Chimbou is to me as chimbou is to your hearts.

625
00:29:26,760 --> 00:29:27,890
BOUCHIN CHIMBOU.

626
00:29:27,890 --> 00:29:30,200
Interpret: Bouchin and chimbou are the same.

627
00:29:30,700 --> 00:29:32,570
&%*%^@#*%^&@.....

628
00:29:32,730 --> 00:29:34,270
Interpret: And for you...

629
00:29:36,370 --> 00:29:38,000
Interpret: In the end, it is Chimbou and piss.

630
00:29:40,270 --> 00:29:41,010
What do you mean?

631
00:29:41,010 --> 00:29:44,210
In the end, it's chimbou and piss in your heart.

632
00:29:44,210 --> 00:29:45,480
In other words, it's a chimbou.

633
00:29:46,350 --> 00:29:48,280
In other words...?

634
00:29:48,280 --> 00:29:49,380
It's a Chimbo Chokan.
(Chimbo Secretary)

635
00:29:49,380 --> 00:29:50,920
Chimbo Chokan?

636
00:29:50,920 --> 00:29:52,290
It's like a Kombo Chokan?
(Cabinet Secretary)

637
00:29:52,550 --> 00:29:54,250
Chimbocho!

638
00:29:54,650 --> 00:29:55,920
It's Jimbocho, right?
(Note: 21)

639
00:29:55,920 --> 00:29:57,590
Is this about Jimbocho?

640
00:29:57,590 --> 00:29:59,230
Chimbocho seems to mean Jimbocho.

641
00:29:59,230 --> 00:29:59,930
Chimbocho!

642
00:30:04,300 --> 00:30:04,930
What?

643
00:30:09,000 --> 00:30:10,570
What the hell is this!?

644
00:30:13,110 --> 00:30:15,540
Moon Crystal Power!
(Note: 22)

645
00:30:22,520 --> 00:30:24,380
- Chimbo Ninja!
- What the hell!

646
00:30:24,620 --> 00:30:26,490
Kotouge!

647
00:30:26,820 --> 00:30:28,620
What are these guys doing?

648
00:30:29,920 --> 00:30:31,560
That's insane.

649
00:30:31,560 --> 00:30:32,560
Chimbou Ninja.

650
00:30:32,860 --> 00:30:37,330
Chimbou Ninjas are coming through.
Chimbou Chimbou Chimbou Ninja
Chimbou Ninja.

651
00:30:37,700 --> 00:30:40,400
- Chimbou Ninjas are coming through.
- Chimbou Ninja, Chimbou Ninja.

652
00:30:47,270 --> 00:30:49,440
If they touch him, he might become a Chimbou Ninja.

653
00:30:49,940 --> 00:30:52,110
Chimbou Ninjas are coming through.

654
00:30:55,380 --> 00:30:56,320
He didn't become it.

655
00:30:57,250 --> 00:30:58,690
Why didn't you become it?

656
00:31:03,120 --> 00:31:03,960
Are you okay?

657
00:31:04,020 --> 00:31:05,390
He hit his own eye.

658
00:31:08,560 --> 00:31:09,800
Aren't you out?

659
00:31:10,330 --> 00:31:11,330
He overshot it.

660
00:31:11,330 --> 00:31:12,170
Are you okay?

661
00:31:12,670 --> 00:31:14,370
Kotouge is so close!

662
00:31:15,000 --> 00:31:16,470
Why aren't they laughing?

663
00:31:16,600 --> 00:31:18,070
This hit me in the eye.

664
00:31:24,440 --> 00:31:25,350
你好(Hello.)

665
00:31:26,650 --> 00:31:27,910
I'm from China.

666
00:31:28,880 --> 00:31:30,950
China is advanced in science.

667
00:31:31,780 --> 00:31:33,850
Especially, the research of cloning is very advanced.

668
00:31:35,790 --> 00:31:37,820
All the best people are being cloned.

669
00:31:38,830 --> 00:31:40,260
Clones of you were also made.

670
00:31:41,490 --> 00:31:42,060
I'm scared!

671
00:31:42,060 --> 00:31:44,530
I will give you this document.
Let's look your clones together with me.

672
00:31:45,200 --> 00:31:46,700
Then follow my instructions and look at them.

673
00:31:46,700 --> 00:31:48,370
That's so...

674
00:31:48,370 --> 00:31:50,040
- They will be afraid to look at this.
- Yeah.

675
00:31:50,040 --> 00:31:51,440
I'm sure you all would be happy to have your own clones made.

676
00:31:52,140 --> 00:31:54,070
In other words, you guys are excellent.

677
00:31:55,110 --> 00:31:56,740
If you are not excellent, your clone will not be made.

678
00:31:56,740 --> 00:31:57,680
Rright.

679
00:31:57,680 --> 00:32:01,380
It's amazing that they have already made clones of you guys.
Let's look at the first one.

680
00:32:01,380 --> 00:32:04,380
Who is it?
It's Yuriyan Retriever.

681
00:32:04,380 --> 00:32:05,950
- This is me.
- Oh, Yuriyan.

682
00:32:05,950 --> 00:32:07,290
This is an earlier photo.

683
00:32:07,290 --> 00:32:08,590
- An earlier photo?
- Yes.

684
00:32:08,960 --> 00:32:10,890
Your clone has already been made.

685
00:32:10,890 --> 00:32:16,300
- It looks a little different. But it's your clone.
Your DNA is very important.
- This is scary!

686
00:32:16,500 --> 00:32:18,230
Yes, this is very scary!

687
00:32:18,230 --> 00:32:20,270
Now look at the next page.

688
00:32:22,940 --> 00:32:24,570
This is almost me.
But...

689
00:32:24,600 --> 00:32:25,810
Yes.

690
00:32:26,140 --> 00:32:28,110
This is a very excellent clone.

691
00:32:28,110 --> 00:32:29,940
What can this clone do?

692
00:32:29,940 --> 00:32:30,910
She is just breathing now.

693
00:32:30,910 --> 00:32:32,250
What the hell!

694
00:32:32,580 --> 00:32:35,550
I really want to say "What the hell".

695
00:32:35,550 --> 00:32:36,880
Can't this one speak?

696
00:32:36,880 --> 00:32:38,380
- Then let's look at the next page.
- What the hell!

697
00:32:38,380 --> 00:32:39,720
It's very funny, though.

698
00:32:39,720 --> 00:32:41,490
- It's Zakoshisho.
- It's me.

699
00:32:41,490 --> 00:32:42,820
You're very good.

700
00:32:42,820 --> 00:32:44,060
- That's why your clone was made.
- Really?

701
00:32:44,060 --> 00:32:46,330
- You are the L-1 winner?
- R-1.
(Note: 23)

702
00:32:46,330 --> 00:32:49,100
- And Decumental?
- Documental.
- You won it twice.

703
00:32:49,100 --> 00:32:50,600
- You are very good.
- Yes.

704
00:32:50,600 --> 00:32:51,900
That's why your clone was made.

705
00:32:51,900 --> 00:32:54,200
- The Chinese all want a clone of you.
- Really?

706
00:32:54,200 --> 00:32:55,200
Let's take a look.

707
00:32:55,570 --> 00:32:57,300
You became a comedy duo.

708
00:32:58,170 --> 00:33:00,910
This is Arapon.
(Note: 24)

709
00:33:01,940 --> 00:33:02,840
Who is it?

710
00:33:06,010 --> 00:33:06,710
It's Arapon.

711
00:33:06,710 --> 00:33:08,010
Now turn the document sideways.

712
00:33:08,080 --> 00:33:08,780
He already exists!

713
00:33:08,850 --> 00:33:10,850
Turn it sideways.

714
00:33:10,850 --> 00:33:13,590
Look at the next page.
It's Toro Salmon.

715
00:33:15,490 --> 00:33:18,760
As you all know, they are the winners of M-1.
They're very good, too.
(Note: 25)

716
00:33:19,030 --> 00:33:21,090
Of course, their clones were also made.

717
00:33:21,090 --> 00:33:22,200
Turn to the next page slowly.

718
00:33:22,730 --> 00:33:26,030
First, it's Kubota-san.
This is your clone.

719
00:33:26,770 --> 00:33:27,600
Who is this?

720
00:33:27,600 --> 00:33:28,970
He looks like he could be somewhere.

721
00:33:29,340 --> 00:33:29,940
Who is this?

722
00:33:29,940 --> 00:33:30,940
He is very good.

723
00:33:30,940 --> 00:33:32,010
This is a failure, isn't it?

724
00:33:32,010 --> 00:33:33,010
No.

725
00:33:33,010 --> 00:33:34,540
This is a failure.

726
00:33:34,540 --> 00:33:35,540
This is weird.

727
00:33:35,540 --> 00:33:38,410
His mouse looks like it's higher up.
Look next to him.

728
00:33:38,410 --> 00:33:39,780
He looks like someone.

729
00:33:39,780 --> 00:33:41,110
His face is very long.

730
00:33:41,110 --> 00:33:42,880
I've seen this one before.

731
00:33:42,880 --> 00:33:43,780
Me too.

732
00:33:43,780 --> 00:33:46,390
Let's look at this zoomed in picture on this page again

733
00:33:47,220 --> 00:33:49,460
Let's look at this zoomed in picture.

734
00:33:49,460 --> 00:33:51,660
- Isn't he the comedian we often refer to as "I’m so frustrated"?
- What?

735
00:33:51,660 --> 00:33:54,690
- Isn't he the comedian we often refer to as "I’m so frustrated"?
- Ah, it's Kato.
(Note: 26)

736
00:33:55,800 --> 00:33:56,830
It looks like Kato.

737
00:33:56,830 --> 00:33:58,730
Then let's look at the next page.

738
00:33:59,930 --> 00:34:03,540
- Oh, Kotouge-san.
- It's Viking.
- They're very good, too.

739
00:34:04,500 --> 00:34:07,470
- Are you the King of Conte winner?
- Yes.
- You are very good.
(Note: 27)

740
00:34:08,210 --> 00:34:09,940
- Your buddy is Nishimura?
- Yes.

741
00:34:09,940 --> 00:34:12,310
That's why your clones were made.

742
00:34:12,310 --> 00:34:15,880
They are very good clones in China.
They are both excellent.

743
00:34:15,880 --> 00:34:16,920
Now let's look at the clones.

744
00:34:18,850 --> 00:34:20,550
It's scary.

745
00:34:20,550 --> 00:34:23,960
They looks like they could be somewhere.

746
00:34:25,660 --> 00:34:28,860
His head is long.
It's disgusting.

747
00:34:28,860 --> 00:34:31,760
Kotouge's head is shaped like rice.

748
00:34:31,760 --> 00:34:33,200
They look like Akina.

749
00:34:33,200 --> 00:34:34,770
He has a very long head.
(Note: 28)

750
00:34:34,970 --> 00:34:36,670
His eyes are kind of far apart, which is weird.

751
00:34:36,670 --> 00:34:38,640
I've seen them before.

752
00:34:38,640 --> 00:34:41,570
- Yeah, I've seen him before.
- They look like they could be somewhere.

753
00:34:41,570 --> 00:34:43,540
They look like Akina.

754
00:34:43,540 --> 00:34:47,310
Yeah.
Let's look at this zoomed in picture on this page again

755
00:34:47,310 --> 00:34:48,920
They are Akina.

756
00:34:49,280 --> 00:34:53,690
Their faces are totally different from the originals, but there are more distinctive differences.

757
00:34:54,290 --> 00:34:55,490
Look at Kotouge's ears.

758
00:34:56,190 --> 00:34:58,720
How small!

759
00:35:00,490 --> 00:35:01,690
It's like a cork.

760
00:35:03,300 --> 00:35:05,800
Nishimura's are small too, but his are even smaller!

761
00:35:06,170 --> 00:35:07,770
His ears are too small.

762
00:35:07,770 --> 00:35:09,900
His right ear has a pointed tip.

763
00:35:10,740 --> 00:35:12,370
It's like a hook.

764
00:35:12,410 --> 00:35:14,010
This is Chinese cloning technology.

765
00:35:14,370 --> 00:35:18,280
Yamamoto is next.
Let's take a look at Yamamoto's clone.

766
00:35:18,710 --> 00:35:22,050
What kind of clone did they make of him?
Then let's take a look.

767
00:35:22,520 --> 00:35:23,750
It says something.

768
00:35:23,750 --> 00:35:24,850
They haven't made his clone?

769
00:35:24,850 --> 00:35:26,390
"Keiichi Yamamoto - His clone does not exist."

770
00:35:26,390 --> 00:35:34,390
"Keiichi Yamamoto was not worthy of cloning after careful investigation.  It was determined that posterity does not need his DNA."

771
00:35:34,390 --> 00:35:39,930
"Therefore, the cloning of Keiichi Yamamoto and the sale of meat wrapped rice balls are strictly prohibited."

772
00:35:40,800 --> 00:35:43,270
Unfortunately, you are not good enough, so your clone will not be made.

773
00:35:44,140 --> 00:35:44,970
Sorry.

774
00:35:44,970 --> 00:35:45,640
It's okay.

775
00:35:45,940 --> 00:35:51,140
If you want to resume selling meat wrapped rice balls, please apologize seriously to Kin-chan.
(Note: 29)

776
00:35:55,980 --> 00:35:56,980
I see.

777
00:35:56,980 --> 00:35:58,350
Thank you.

778
00:35:59,690 --> 00:36:01,450
- Do you have a minute?
- Sure.

779
00:36:01,450 --> 00:36:03,290
Where did you go this summer?

780
00:36:03,290 --> 00:36:04,790
- I didn't go.
- Me too.

781
00:36:04,990 --> 00:36:09,460
- I didn't go anywhere either. But I wanted to do something.
- What?

782
00:36:09,560 --> 00:36:11,400
- Please sit here.
- Me?
- Yes.

783
00:36:14,200 --> 00:36:17,600
I like to collect beetles and stag beetles.

784
00:36:19,070 --> 00:36:23,940
So I want to...Excuse me.

785
00:36:23,940 --> 00:36:25,080
It's honey.

786
00:36:25,080 --> 00:36:26,910
Please be patient a little.

787
00:36:26,910 --> 00:36:27,910
It's alright?

788
00:36:30,380 --> 00:36:31,220
This is a beetle!

789
00:36:32,020 --> 00:36:33,250
- Are you serious?
- So big!

790
00:36:33,250 --> 00:36:35,420
- This isn't ordinary beetle, is it?
-  Is it alright?

791
00:36:35,420 --> 00:36:37,290
- So big!
- It's beetle?

792
00:36:37,290 --> 00:36:38,560
Is it beetle?

793
00:36:39,560 --> 00:36:41,530
- That's terible.
- It has three horns.

794
00:36:42,800 --> 00:36:44,460
- Are you sure that it's safe?"
- Yes.

795
00:36:44,460 --> 00:36:46,800
- Is this a Hercules beetle?
- Yeah, it's a pretty good one.
(Note: 30)

796
00:36:50,100 --> 00:36:51,300
Is it alright?

797
00:36:51,300 --> 00:36:53,210
- I want to see these sucking honey!
- You wanna see it!?

798
00:36:54,040 --> 00:36:54,940
I'm scared!

799
00:36:55,270 --> 00:36:55,910
Excuse me.

800
00:36:55,910 --> 00:36:56,740
I'm scared!

801
00:36:57,180 --> 00:36:58,310
Is it okay?

802
00:37:02,080 --> 00:37:04,620
Ouch!
Ow!

803
00:37:04,680 --> 00:37:05,450
Oh, it's great!

804
00:37:05,450 --> 00:37:06,920
Its feet are digging into my scalp.

805
00:37:06,920 --> 00:37:08,350
Ow-ow-ow-ow...!

806
00:37:08,350 --> 00:37:10,720
- Shall I make a video?
- Please.

807
00:37:10,720 --> 00:37:12,890
Ouch!
Ow!
These feet...

808
00:37:12,890 --> 00:37:15,230
- These are sucking it!
- Really!?

809
00:37:15,230 --> 00:37:17,600
These are sucking the honey.

810
00:37:17,600 --> 00:37:18,760
This is an amazing scene.

811
00:37:18,760 --> 00:37:19,730
You stink.

812
00:37:19,730 --> 00:37:24,300
Ouch its...its feet are digging into my scalp!

813
00:37:26,770 --> 00:37:27,710
Watch out!

814
00:37:27,710 --> 00:37:28,940
- What's wrong, Cookie?
- Cookie-san is close.

815
00:37:29,710 --> 00:37:30,480
Ouch!!

816
00:37:30,480 --> 00:37:31,540
Don't make loud noises!

817
00:37:31,540 --> 00:37:33,650
Because the beetles will be startled.

818
00:37:33,650 --> 00:37:35,280
Ow-ow-ow-ow...

819
00:37:35,280 --> 00:37:37,480
Don't move, I'm shooting a video now!

820
00:37:37,480 --> 00:37:38,450
They are sucking honey!

821
00:37:38,450 --> 00:37:41,650
Ow-ow-ow-ow...

822
00:37:42,150 --> 00:37:43,690
I will take one off.
Sorry.

823
00:37:43,690 --> 00:37:44,520
Is this a female?

824
00:37:44,520 --> 00:37:46,660
Ow-ow-ow-ow!!

825
00:37:46,660 --> 00:37:48,860
Beetles are scraping his scalp.

826
00:37:50,560 --> 00:37:51,730
That's insane.

827
00:37:51,730 --> 00:37:54,400
This thing is really hungry for honey.

828
00:37:54,400 --> 00:37:56,300
It has big nails.

829
00:37:57,070 --> 00:37:58,570
This thing is really hungry for honey.

830
00:37:58,570 --> 00:38:00,440
Hey! It's eating your hair follicles!

831
00:38:00,440 --> 00:38:01,910
Eating my hair follicles!?

832
00:38:01,910 --> 00:38:03,610
Is it serious!?

833
00:38:03,610 --> 00:38:04,480
My hair follicles...!

834
00:38:07,110 --> 00:38:08,180
That's enough.

835
00:38:10,080 --> 00:38:11,680
It's okay!

836
00:38:12,620 --> 00:38:14,790
- Sorry, Kotouge-san.
- Don't worry. This will be a good memory.

837
00:38:16,460 --> 00:38:17,920
Those things were very honey sucking.

838
00:38:17,920 --> 00:38:19,430
That was great.

839
00:38:19,430 --> 00:38:20,130
Really?

840
00:38:20,130 --> 00:38:23,330
I could really feel it digging into my scalp

841
00:38:23,330 --> 00:38:26,030
This is the first time an insect has appeared in this room.

842
00:38:26,030 --> 00:38:27,470
That was great.

843
00:38:27,470 --> 00:38:29,140
Hey.

844
00:38:30,370 --> 00:38:33,510
Can I do "body impression" of Akiyama-kun?
(Note: 31)

845
00:38:33,510 --> 00:38:34,910
Yes.

846
00:38:42,450 --> 00:38:43,420
It's you.

847
00:38:43,420 --> 00:38:45,320
Hey, he's taking the piss.

848
00:38:45,350 --> 00:38:46,550
Piss?

849
00:38:48,120 --> 00:38:48,950
Ah.

850
00:38:49,190 --> 00:38:50,220
This is an icicle.

851
00:38:50,620 --> 00:38:51,760
Are you cold?

852
00:38:51,990 --> 00:38:55,490
It's been cold lately, right?
That's why the icicle got stuck in my urethra.

853
00:38:56,700 --> 00:38:58,960
Are you saying that an icicle fell down and got in there?

854
00:38:59,430 --> 00:39:01,300
It's not your frozen piss, right?

855
00:39:01,630 --> 00:39:02,970
The icicle had a "hole-in-one" here.

856
00:39:03,970 --> 00:39:05,070
It's so cold.

857
00:39:05,600 --> 00:39:06,670
I'm hot, though.

858
00:39:06,670 --> 00:39:07,870
Yuriyan, touch it.

859
00:39:07,870 --> 00:39:08,840
May I touch it?

860
00:39:19,490 --> 00:39:20,990
I found it!

861
00:39:21,290 --> 00:39:22,390
Wait a second!

862
00:39:23,490 --> 00:39:25,160
What's this duo?

863
00:39:38,700 --> 00:39:39,970
Oh, it's out!

864
00:39:41,670 --> 00:39:43,510
He made it so that this will pull out of this.

865
00:39:46,010 --> 00:39:46,810
What happened?

866
00:39:47,010 --> 00:39:48,380
Oh, it's cold

867
00:39:49,380 --> 00:39:50,550
It's cold

868
00:39:56,460 --> 00:39:58,260
Why isn't everybody laughing?

869
00:40:02,700 --> 00:40:03,830
It's cold.

870
00:40:06,100 --> 00:40:07,700
What are these guys doing all the time?

871
00:40:14,210 --> 00:40:15,410
I'm embarrassing!

872
00:40:15,510 --> 00:40:16,310
Why?

873
00:40:16,680 --> 00:40:17,980
Because I'm not wearing pants.

874
00:40:18,780 --> 00:40:20,250
Then put something on.

875
00:40:29,090 --> 00:40:30,720
Yamamoto-san, come here.

876
00:40:32,120 --> 00:40:34,890
Please fan yourself.
You are my senior.

877
00:40:38,730 --> 00:40:40,070
You can fan harder.

878
00:40:52,750 --> 00:40:53,780
What's wrong, Yuri-chan?

879
00:40:54,580 --> 00:40:55,580
What are you doing?

880
00:40:58,480 --> 00:40:59,690
Aren't you ashamed of yourself?

881
00:41:00,290 --> 00:41:00,920
A little.

882
00:41:00,920 --> 00:41:07,960
You are certainly not disgraceful.
You are kneeling on the gloor desperately fanning yourself to see your junior's panties.

883
00:41:07,960 --> 00:41:09,160
Aren't you ashamed of yourself?

884
00:41:09,360 --> 00:41:10,700
You are naked and kneeling on the floor.

885
00:41:10,860 --> 00:41:11,860
You are naked and kneeling on the floor.

886
00:41:12,000 --> 00:41:12,530
And you're fanning.

887
00:41:12,800 --> 00:41:13,570
And you're fanning.

888
00:41:17,940 --> 00:41:19,210
So cute.

889
00:41:22,010 --> 00:41:22,840
So cute.

890
00:41:23,680 --> 00:41:25,110
Who are you?

891
00:41:25,410 --> 00:41:26,010
Can't you talk?

892
00:41:26,010 --> 00:41:27,410
Who are you?
You can't talk?

893
00:41:29,550 --> 00:41:30,480
He closed with his elbow

894
00:41:33,220 --> 00:41:36,690
Huh?
Did he just laugh?

895
00:41:39,430 --> 00:41:41,830
He turned around so I couldn't see him.

896
00:42:02,620 --> 00:42:03,850
Yamamoto-san, fan her butt.

897
00:42:04,350 --> 00:42:06,050
- Yuri-chan, is that okay?
- Yes.

898
00:42:06,720 --> 00:42:08,490
Please do it.

899
00:42:13,030 --> 00:42:13,890
What's this?

900
00:42:25,340 --> 00:42:27,870
Hey, hey, hey, hey...

901
00:42:28,640 --> 00:42:29,510
Aren't you ashamed of yourself?

902
00:42:32,180 --> 00:42:35,980
You were going slowly, rubbing your feet on the floor.

903
00:42:37,420 --> 00:42:38,750
You are pathetic.

904
00:42:39,020 --> 00:42:39,990
You are pathetic.

905
00:42:40,390 --> 00:42:41,320
You are pathetic.

906
00:42:41,590 --> 00:42:43,260
Don't fan your armpits with someone's fan.

907
00:42:46,860 --> 00:42:47,730
This is a fish head.

908
00:42:48,530 --> 00:42:50,430
"Gyo Gyo Gyo! It's Sakana-kun!"
(Note: 32)

909
00:42:50,430 --> 00:42:51,960
This stinks.

910
00:42:51,960 --> 00:42:54,370
"It's Sakana-kun! Gyo Gyo Gyo!"

911
00:42:54,370 --> 00:42:55,200
It's disgusting!

912
00:42:55,200 --> 00:42:58,270
Gyo Gyo Gyo!
Let me eat some puffer fish poison!

913
00:42:58,900 --> 00:43:02,540
Poison! Poison!
Let me eat some puffer fish poison!

914
00:43:02,540 --> 00:43:03,180
This guy is scary.

915
00:43:03,180 --> 00:43:04,680
"It's Sakana-kun! Gyo Gyo Gyo!"

916
00:43:05,180 --> 00:43:06,280
"Gyo Gyo Gyo!"

917
00:43:06,280 --> 00:43:07,910
This is real tuna skin.

918
00:43:07,910 --> 00:43:09,420
Yeah.

919
00:43:10,520 --> 00:43:11,850
I absolutely hate this kind of thing.

920
00:43:13,390 --> 00:43:15,490
The reverse side is absolutely gross.

921
00:43:15,490 --> 00:43:15,960
It stinks!

922
00:43:16,490 --> 00:43:19,260
So gross!

923
00:43:19,960 --> 00:43:21,830
And it stinks!

924
00:43:22,530 --> 00:43:25,230
This smells like your armpits, not fish!

925
00:43:25,230 --> 00:43:26,070
My armpits stink?

926
00:43:26,070 --> 00:43:26,800
Your armpits stink.

927
00:43:26,800 --> 00:43:27,970
How could you wear that?

928
00:43:29,740 --> 00:43:32,300
Why go to all that trouble just to make us laugh?

929
00:43:32,300 --> 00:43:33,940
Everyone does it.

930
00:43:36,740 --> 00:43:37,480
It stinks!

931
00:43:38,010 --> 00:43:40,280
God... that smell!

932
00:43:40,280 --> 00:43:43,550
It stinks around here!

933
00:43:45,180 --> 00:43:46,050
It stinks!

934
00:43:49,490 --> 00:43:51,060
I'm confident of....

935
00:43:53,160 --> 00:43:55,960
This is what I was confident about.

936
00:43:57,360 --> 00:43:59,100
Don't you wonder how these guys hear the sound?

937
00:44:00,170 --> 00:44:04,570
I wanted you to flip it like this.

938
00:44:04,940 --> 00:44:10,210
"Wow, what a disgusting face, and such small ears!"
"What small ears!"

939
00:44:10,440 --> 00:44:12,310
"Hey, what's with the ears!?"

940
00:44:12,850 --> 00:44:13,810
Didn't you think so?

941
00:44:16,620 --> 00:44:18,080
Look at his ears.

942
00:44:18,850 --> 00:44:20,790
This looks like pig's intestines.

943
00:44:22,590 --> 00:44:24,220
Why does he keep looking at Coo?

944
00:44:28,730 --> 00:44:30,000
Oh, it's Tiger Mask.
(Note: 33)

945
00:44:33,530 --> 00:44:34,270
Hello.

946
00:44:34,270 --> 00:44:39,510
"Liger-kun and all my fans in Fukuoka,"

947
00:44:40,510 --> 00:44:44,410
"Please wait a little longer until I feel better."

948
00:44:46,110 --> 00:44:50,750
This is the impression of Satoru Sayama during an exhibition match in Fukuoka Dome.
(Note: 34)

949
00:44:51,380 --> 00:44:58,990
"Liger-kun and all my fans in Fukuoka,
Please wait a little longer until I feel better."

950
00:45:00,130 --> 00:45:00,990
I don't know that.

951
00:45:01,890 --> 00:45:03,730
He said that?

952
00:45:03,860 --> 00:45:05,330
Do you just repeat it?

953
00:45:05,830 --> 00:45:07,030
Do you want to repeat that?

954
00:45:07,470 --> 00:45:11,640
Liger-kun
Please wait a little longer
Liger-kun
Please wait a little longer
Liger-kun
Please wait a little longer....

955
00:45:17,010 --> 00:45:17,710
What?

956
00:45:18,080 --> 00:45:19,210
Please wait a little longer.

957
00:45:27,420 --> 00:45:28,220
Huh!?

958
00:45:28,220 --> 00:45:29,320
He showed his face.

959
00:45:31,660 --> 00:45:33,290
No wonder he is angry.

960
00:45:33,290 --> 00:45:34,930
"Don’t mess with me."

961
00:45:34,930 --> 00:45:36,800
"Don’t mess with me, hey."

962
00:45:36,800 --> 00:45:40,000
Don't take my mask off!
"Don’t mess with me, hey."

963
00:45:40,300 --> 00:45:41,070
"Don’t mess with me!"

964
00:45:42,430 --> 00:45:43,370
"I'll kill you!"

965
00:45:44,900 --> 00:45:47,070
- I am Satoru Sayama of Shooting gym.
- I miss it.
(Note: 35)

966
00:45:47,240 --> 00:45:48,010
"Don’t mess with me!"

967
00:45:49,340 --> 00:45:50,380
I almost forgot about that.

968
00:45:50,380 --> 00:45:52,040
Cookie is so close!

969
00:45:53,650 --> 00:45:54,410
"Don’t mess with me!"

970
00:45:56,250 --> 00:46:00,720
I'm about to laugh because I watched it on TV.

971
00:46:01,650 --> 00:46:03,290
"Don’t mess with me!"

972
00:46:04,560 --> 00:46:06,430
"Hey, kick me here."

973
00:46:06,560 --> 00:46:07,560
Why?

974
00:46:07,860 --> 00:46:09,260
Kick here.

975
00:46:11,230 --> 00:46:12,000
"Don’t mess with me!"

976
00:46:12,360 --> 00:46:14,430
"Is that your best kick?"

977
00:46:14,730 --> 00:46:16,740
"Don’t mess with me!"
"Don’t mess with me!"

978
00:46:17,670 --> 00:46:19,200
"I'll kill you!"

979
00:46:19,200 --> 00:46:20,040
Watch out!

980
00:46:20,210 --> 00:46:20,770
Watch out!

981
00:46:21,170 --> 00:46:24,280
"Don’t mess with me!"
"Hey, don’t mess with me!"

982
00:46:24,710 --> 00:46:25,880
"Don’t mess with me!"

983
00:46:26,950 --> 00:46:27,780
"I'll kill you!"

984
00:46:28,080 --> 00:46:29,310
Did he do this?

985
00:46:29,410 --> 00:46:30,220
"Please wait a little longer"

986
00:46:30,220 --> 00:46:32,050
He didn't do this.

987
00:46:32,050 --> 00:46:35,220
"Liger-kun and all my fans in Fukuoka."

988
00:46:35,220 --> 00:46:36,820
How many times are you going to do the same thing?

989
00:46:36,860 --> 00:46:38,790
"Please wait a little longer until I feel better."

990
00:46:38,790 --> 00:46:40,030
He wouldn't say that.

991
00:46:40,030 --> 00:46:41,260
"Don’t mess with me!"

992
00:46:42,190 --> 00:46:43,530
He endured.

993
00:46:46,530 --> 00:46:47,170
What?

994
00:46:47,630 --> 00:46:48,270
What's wrong?

995
00:46:48,600 --> 00:46:50,270
She keeps looking at me.

996
00:46:51,040 --> 00:46:51,970
What is this?

997
00:46:52,570 --> 00:46:53,770
What's this?

998
00:46:56,940 --> 00:47:00,480
Kotouge, what is that?

999
00:47:00,480 --> 00:47:01,050
This is...

1000
00:47:02,750 --> 00:47:04,180
The pig's blood.

1001
00:47:04,880 --> 00:47:06,250
I feel sorry.

1002
00:47:09,990 --> 00:47:10,560
Tasty?

1003
00:47:10,560 --> 00:47:11,120
Yes.

1004
00:47:11,860 --> 00:47:13,260
It tastes like livestock.

1005
00:47:13,260 --> 00:47:15,190
Taste of being tamed?

1006
00:47:16,090 --> 00:47:17,260
It's black magic.

1007
00:47:17,260 --> 00:47:20,100
It really smells like blood.

1008
00:47:20,230 --> 00:47:22,000
- It's pig's blood.
- Really?

1009
00:47:22,000 --> 00:47:24,570
Look, someone's here because you drank pig's blood.

1010
00:47:25,070 --> 00:47:26,540
Oh, Koumedayu?
(Note: 36)

1011
00:47:35,150 --> 00:47:36,520
He is identical to him.

1012
00:47:45,990 --> 00:47:47,360
Did Coo laugh?

1013
00:47:47,360 --> 00:47:48,760
How about it?

1014
00:47:49,090 --> 00:47:50,460
- Did he laugh?
- He might have.

1015
00:47:50,760 --> 00:47:52,430
I don't like the sound of that.

1016
00:47:52,430 --> 00:47:54,930
- I hate "Chan."
- It's a high-pitched sound.

1017
00:47:59,500 --> 00:48:00,210
Kotouge.

1018
00:48:02,540 --> 00:48:04,110
Don't do that.

1019
00:48:05,940 --> 00:48:09,210
Why'd you stop for a bit?

1020
00:48:12,990 --> 00:48:15,990
I hate that sound.

1021
00:48:20,390 --> 00:48:27,430
I thought it was the numeral one.

1022
00:48:27,430 --> 00:48:28,900
He sounds like him.

1023
00:48:29,330 --> 00:48:32,170
But it was a chimbou.

1024
00:48:32,640 --> 00:48:34,270
Chimboooooou!!

1025
00:48:34,470 --> 00:48:36,170
That's enough.

1026
00:48:36,580 --> 00:48:38,310
When you say it, it's over.

1027
00:48:38,310 --> 00:48:39,510
Enough with the chimbou.

1028
00:48:40,010 --> 00:48:41,180
It's over.

1029
00:48:41,180 --> 00:48:47,350
Somebody pull my chimbou out!

1030
00:48:47,590 --> 00:48:48,490
Hey, chimbou.

1031
00:48:48,590 --> 00:48:49,860
His voice sounds very similar to Koumedayu.

1032
00:48:50,060 --> 00:48:51,690
You wanna be a woman?

1033
00:48:53,130 --> 00:48:55,060
Don't say "chan."

1034
00:49:00,770 --> 00:49:02,940
He always hits him.

1035
00:49:02,940 --> 00:49:04,300
Why would he hit him?

1036
00:49:05,670 --> 00:49:07,540
How long can you endure getting hitted?

1037
00:49:07,970 --> 00:49:08,970
It hurts, right?

1038
00:49:09,510 --> 00:49:11,510
It doesn't hurt that much, does it?
It's no big deal.

1039
00:49:13,010 --> 00:49:16,450
I going hit you harder little by little so tell me when you reach your limit.
You want to know the limit of this, don't you?

1040
00:49:16,450 --> 00:49:17,580
Yes, I want to know.

1041
00:49:18,150 --> 00:49:20,690
Okay, I'll start off gently.
The first hit is about this much.

1042
00:49:20,690 --> 00:49:21,250
How about this?

1043
00:49:21,920 --> 00:49:23,160
It doesn't hurt at all.

1044
00:49:23,490 --> 00:49:24,920
Next.
How about this?

1045
00:49:25,490 --> 00:49:26,860
This doesn't hurt either.

1046
00:49:27,060 --> 00:49:27,830
Next.

1047
00:49:29,860 --> 00:49:31,360
Did that hurt?

1048
00:49:31,430 --> 00:49:33,070
How many times did he get hit today?

1049
00:49:35,200 --> 00:49:37,540
It hurt more the third hit than the second hit.

1050
00:49:38,540 --> 00:49:39,400
Then...

1051
00:49:40,810 --> 00:49:42,240
A big one.

1052
00:49:46,810 --> 00:49:49,920
Cookie is so close.

1053
00:49:49,920 --> 00:49:50,880
Can I do it with this?

1054
00:49:52,050 --> 00:49:53,420
won’t it hurt if you hit him with that?

1055
00:49:53,420 --> 00:49:54,790
It's scary

1056
00:49:54,790 --> 00:49:55,920
This is quite dangerous.

1057
00:49:56,920 --> 00:49:57,990
What if he bleeds out?

1058
00:49:57,990 --> 00:50:00,090
You shouldn't do that, it's scary.

1059
00:50:00,090 --> 00:50:01,530
I know it's dangerous.

1060
00:50:01,530 --> 00:50:02,630
This is hard.

1061
00:50:03,260 --> 00:50:04,360
Wait a second.

1062
00:50:04,360 --> 00:50:06,430
Are you massaging your scalp?

1063
00:50:06,670 --> 00:50:09,500
I don't want you to bleed.

1064
00:50:09,500 --> 00:50:10,640
- Yeah.
- Let's not do that.

1065
00:50:10,640 --> 00:50:12,000
You massaging your scalp won't help.

1066
00:50:12,000 --> 00:50:14,040
Are you guys underground fighters?

1067
00:50:14,040 --> 00:50:15,710
Why do you want to be hit so badly?

1068
00:50:15,710 --> 00:50:18,040
You said you'd do it, so do it.

1069
00:50:18,640 --> 00:50:21,350
Are you all right?
I'm worried.

1070
00:50:22,180 --> 00:50:24,950
Because you are my favorite senior.

1071
00:50:24,950 --> 00:50:26,620
Your favorite senior?

1072
00:50:26,620 --> 00:50:28,720
If you insist, shall we do it?

1073
00:50:28,920 --> 00:50:32,820
How about you hit him after you hit me and Zakoshi-san?
Like one, two, three.

1074
00:50:32,820 --> 00:50:33,930
Yeah.

1075
00:50:33,930 --> 00:50:35,460
You hit us to build up momentum.

1076
00:50:36,290 --> 00:50:37,330
Here we go.

1077
00:50:37,330 --> 00:50:39,130
If you think it is dangerous, please stop.

1078
00:50:39,800 --> 00:50:41,330
You can't stop after you do it.

1079
00:50:41,330 --> 00:50:42,370
This is dangerous.

1080
00:50:43,740 --> 00:50:44,970
See?

1081
00:50:45,670 --> 00:50:47,410
How hard should I hit you the first hit?

1082
00:50:48,410 --> 00:50:50,040
This was quite painful.

1083
00:50:50,740 --> 00:50:52,780
How hard should I hit you the first hit?

1084
00:50:57,280 --> 00:50:57,950
What's wrong?

1085
00:50:57,950 --> 00:50:58,680
I want to do it!

1086
00:50:59,050 --> 00:50:59,450
Huh?

1087
00:50:59,450 --> 00:50:59,850
I want to do it!

1088
00:51:00,190 --> 00:51:02,390
Stop it, you're a woman.

1089
00:51:02,850 --> 00:51:04,020
You can't.

1090
00:51:04,020 --> 00:51:05,490
Yeah. you can't.

1091
00:51:07,690 --> 00:51:08,660
What?

1092
00:51:10,600 --> 00:51:11,130
What?

1093
00:51:11,130 --> 00:51:12,360
I don't think you can.

1094
00:51:12,360 --> 00:51:12,900
Why?

1095
00:51:13,200 --> 00:51:14,970
Why not!?

1096
00:51:15,800 --> 00:51:17,000
(Why can't I do it?)

1097
00:51:17,000 --> 00:51:18,370
What did she say?

1098
00:51:19,940 --> 00:51:21,240
What are you doing?

1099
00:51:28,380 --> 00:51:29,410
It doesn't hurt that much, does it?

1100
00:51:37,990 --> 00:51:39,020
Nice.

1101
00:51:39,390 --> 00:51:40,460
Nice!

1102
00:51:42,730 --> 00:51:43,800
This is never going to end.

1103
00:51:46,400 --> 00:51:47,430
Please, stop fighting.

1104
00:51:48,670 --> 00:51:49,870
Please.

1105
00:51:55,710 --> 00:51:57,140
Sorry.

1106
00:51:57,410 --> 00:51:58,240
Are you okay?

1107
00:52:04,120 --> 00:52:05,320
How many times did he get hit?

1108
00:52:05,320 --> 00:52:09,390
He's been smacked in the head all day.

1109
00:52:11,060 --> 00:52:12,060
You want us to see the video?

1110
00:52:12,060 --> 00:52:14,060
- Yeah.
- I'd like to show you a video too.

1111
00:52:14,060 --> 00:52:17,830
It started.
Everyone be careful.

1112
00:52:18,300 --> 00:52:19,260
Do you want to play a game?

1113
00:52:19,260 --> 00:52:21,270
Yeah!

1114
00:52:21,270 --> 00:52:23,070
- Then control it with your telekinesis.
- Yes.

1115
00:52:23,940 --> 00:52:25,170
Here we go.

1116
00:52:25,840 --> 00:52:26,470
Let's go.

1117
00:52:31,640 --> 00:52:33,210
Get the coin.
(Note: 37)

1118
00:52:34,110 --> 00:52:34,850
Jump.

1119
00:52:37,450 --> 00:52:38,280
Let's go.

1120
00:52:41,490 --> 00:52:42,450
He bumped his head repeatedly.

1121
00:52:42,450 --> 00:52:44,060
You are not good at it.

1122
00:52:44,060 --> 00:52:45,790
You must suck at telekinesis.

1123
00:52:46,560 --> 00:52:47,490
Let's go.

1124
00:52:49,960 --> 00:52:50,830
Get the coin.

1125
00:52:51,530 --> 00:52:52,200
Jump.

1126
00:52:52,630 --> 00:52:53,400
Jump!

1127
00:52:53,670 --> 00:52:55,170
- It's the star!
- Get the star.

1128
00:52:55,200 --> 00:52:57,100
It's a star with Yoshimoto's mark on it!

1129
00:52:57,470 --> 00:52:58,200
Let's get it.

1130
00:53:01,040 --> 00:53:02,140
He has no jumping ability.

1131
00:53:03,640 --> 00:53:05,010
That looks like it hurts.

1132
00:53:09,150 --> 00:53:12,120
Control it properly.
Here we go.

1133
00:53:13,450 --> 00:53:14,450
Control it!

1134
00:53:14,450 --> 00:53:15,220
Of course.

1135
00:53:15,220 --> 00:53:17,320
I'm controlling it properly.

1136
00:53:17,320 --> 00:53:18,090
Jump!

1137
00:53:19,860 --> 00:53:22,130
Let's step back!

1138
00:53:22,130 --> 00:53:23,500
Let's step back and get the star.

1139
00:53:23,500 --> 00:53:24,500
Got it!

1140
00:53:24,500 --> 00:53:28,930
- It will get a little faster.
- And he got a little younger?
- Let’s go.

1141
00:53:29,700 --> 00:53:30,300
It's golden.

1142
00:53:30,470 --> 00:53:31,070
Shit.

1143
00:53:32,040 --> 00:53:33,270
It was too fast.

1144
00:53:35,210 --> 00:53:36,440
You have to control it.

1145
00:53:36,540 --> 00:53:37,910
His neck was twisted.

1146
00:53:37,910 --> 00:53:39,080
Here we go.

1147
00:53:44,080 --> 00:53:45,520
Jump!

1148
00:53:46,250 --> 00:53:47,250
Okay.

1149
00:53:47,350 --> 00:53:48,290
Jump here.

1150
00:53:49,190 --> 00:53:50,620
You did it before.
You can do it.

1151
00:53:50,890 --> 00:53:52,020
You can do it!

1152
00:53:53,160 --> 00:53:54,590
He barely made it!

1153
00:53:55,530 --> 00:53:56,390
Hang on!

1154
00:53:56,390 --> 00:53:57,900
Something's coming!

1155
00:53:57,900 --> 00:53:59,560
It's Hyoudo-san!
(Note: 38)

1156
00:53:59,560 --> 00:54:00,530
Hyodo-san?

1157
00:54:03,240 --> 00:54:04,470
Oh, his hat got caught.

1158
00:54:05,040 --> 00:54:06,140
Only the hat is left.

1159
00:54:07,570 --> 00:54:08,840
Only the hat is left.

1160
00:54:08,840 --> 00:54:09,540
Here we go.

1161
00:54:11,080 --> 00:54:13,480
Please control it properly!

1162
00:54:16,110 --> 00:54:17,050
Get it!

1163
00:54:18,420 --> 00:54:19,020
Okay.

1164
00:54:19,450 --> 00:54:21,990
Wait for a moment.

1165
00:54:22,390 --> 00:54:23,790
It's coming!

1166
00:54:25,760 --> 00:54:27,290
Let's cross!

1167
00:54:27,860 --> 00:54:30,030
- He was sent flying.
- Did he survive?

1168
00:54:32,330 --> 00:54:33,400
He is bald.

1169
00:54:33,400 --> 00:54:36,800
Is it serious!?
No one is laughing.

1170
00:54:36,800 --> 00:54:39,040
The next is the last.
Here we go!

1171
00:54:43,070 --> 00:54:45,540
Please get it!

1172
00:54:47,510 --> 00:54:50,720
Ah, you're lucky.
Please get on this.

1173
00:54:51,750 --> 00:54:54,890
This should move forward!
Oh, you are lucky!

1174
00:54:54,890 --> 00:54:56,090
Let's move forward!

1175
00:54:59,420 --> 00:55:00,630
He's so bald.

1176
00:55:02,260 --> 00:55:03,360
This is a hat factory.

1177
00:55:03,360 --> 00:55:04,430
Hat factory?

1178
00:55:04,660 --> 00:55:05,460
Oh, cute!

1179
00:55:07,000 --> 00:55:07,900
I see.

1180
00:55:09,570 --> 00:55:11,070
- He died.
- Who?

1181
00:55:11,070 --> 00:55:11,700
Who died?

1182
00:55:11,700 --> 00:55:13,340
Daisuke.

1183
00:55:13,340 --> 00:55:14,340
Daisuke died?

1184
00:55:14,340 --> 00:55:16,040
Why?
Where did he die?

1185
00:55:16,040 --> 00:55:18,340
- Did he die in the back?
- What happened to him?

1186
00:55:19,480 --> 00:55:22,050
I make a lot of images.

1187
00:55:22,650 --> 00:55:24,350
Those are made by my telekinesis.

1188
00:55:24,350 --> 00:55:25,220
Really?

1189
00:55:25,250 --> 00:55:32,990
Now I'm going to show one picture here.
I'm going to transform it with my telekinesis.
I want you to see it.

1190
00:55:34,360 --> 00:55:35,360
Let's start.

1191
00:55:37,160 --> 00:55:39,130
I will use my telekinesis.

1192
00:55:43,270 --> 00:55:46,740
I make Daisuke's face small.

1193
00:55:48,170 --> 00:55:50,340
Oh, it's smaller.

1194
00:56:00,550 --> 00:56:01,450
So small.

1195
00:56:02,750 --> 00:56:04,120
I will turn him back to normal!

1196
00:56:06,220 --> 00:56:09,590
I will turn him back to normal!
I will turn him back to normal!

1197
00:56:17,800 --> 00:56:19,040
Yes, he is back to normal!

1198
00:56:19,040 --> 00:56:20,440
He's not back.

1199
00:56:20,440 --> 00:56:22,040
I'll do Hanako next.

1200
00:56:22,040 --> 00:56:23,380
You do it to Hanako too?

1201
00:56:23,380 --> 00:56:25,910
Daisuke is back to normal, so I'll do Hanako next.

1202
00:56:25,910 --> 00:56:28,680
No, no, no,
What's normal about this?

1203
00:56:28,680 --> 00:56:29,850
Then I'll do it for Hanako.

1204
00:56:35,090 --> 00:56:36,450
Come on, Hanako!

1205
00:56:36,990 --> 00:56:38,890
I'll make Hanako's face smaller!

1206
00:56:40,730 --> 00:56:42,360
This is tremendous telekinesis.

1207
00:56:43,830 --> 00:56:46,130
All right, become small! Become small!

1208
00:56:46,130 --> 00:56:47,230
Look at Daisuke sometimes.

1209
00:56:47,370 --> 00:56:50,670
Become small!
Become small!

1210
00:56:50,870 --> 00:56:52,700
Yes, I will turn her back to normal!

1211
00:56:53,100 --> 00:56:56,470
I will turn her back to normal!

1212
00:57:00,410 --> 00:57:03,110
Hold on!
Plese hold on!

1213
00:57:04,280 --> 00:57:08,020
Maybe my telekinesis is not strong enough!
Hanako is very powerful!

1214
00:57:08,090 --> 00:57:09,320
Is Hanako powerful?

1215
00:57:09,950 --> 00:57:10,860
Get back to normal, Hanako!

1216
00:57:10,860 --> 00:57:12,020
Look at Daisuke from time to time.

1217
00:57:12,020 --> 00:57:13,530
Get back to normal, Hanako!
Come on!

1218
00:57:13,530 --> 00:57:16,030
Hanako is out of control!

1219
00:57:16,030 --> 00:57:18,400
Oh my God!
Hanako is out of control!
I'm sorry!

1220
00:57:19,530 --> 00:57:20,870
She is going to eat Daisuke!

1221
00:57:22,330 --> 00:57:24,970
Daisuke, fight!
Go, Daisuke!

1222
00:57:24,970 --> 00:57:26,100
Do they fight with their heads?

1223
00:57:26,100 --> 00:57:29,670
Go! Daisuke, go!
Beat her!

1224
00:57:31,410 --> 00:57:35,250
Daisuke has absorbed Hanako.

1225
00:57:36,410 --> 00:57:37,080
This is paint.

1226
00:57:37,080 --> 00:57:38,020
It's as if this is a married couple.

1227
00:57:38,880 --> 00:57:41,420
This is what a married couple is.

1228
00:57:43,620 --> 00:57:46,890
There's something weird about his body.

1229
00:57:50,600 --> 00:57:51,800
They are a good couple.

1230
00:57:52,830 --> 00:57:54,500
They are a good couple.

1231
00:57:55,500 --> 00:57:57,040
They are a cute couple.

1232
00:57:57,040 --> 00:57:58,940
What are we being shown?

1233
00:57:59,340 --> 00:58:00,270
He's too small.

1234
00:58:00,270 --> 00:58:03,480
They are a good couple.

1235
00:58:04,210 --> 00:58:05,910
Look at his shoulders!
They are a good couple.

1236
00:58:06,740 --> 00:58:07,550
How cute.

1237
00:58:07,550 --> 00:58:08,480
He’s a whole different person.

1238
00:58:08,480 --> 00:58:13,520
- Ah, they are a good couple.
Right: I believe that aliens exist...
Left: I believe there are UFOs...

1239
00:58:13,520 --> 00:58:14,720
Look at his shoulders.

1240
00:58:14,990 --> 00:58:16,690
And Hanako next to him.

1241
00:58:17,220 --> 00:58:18,390
Hanako is mad.

1242
00:58:19,390 --> 00:58:20,860
Ah, this is them normally.

1243
00:58:20,860 --> 00:58:22,930
This is them normally,

1244
00:58:24,330 --> 00:58:25,760
It's so big!

1245
00:58:27,570 --> 00:58:29,030
His hand was swollen!

1246
00:58:29,030 --> 00:58:30,700
Coo just laughed.

1247
00:58:32,870 --> 00:58:34,270
He laughed.

1248
00:58:34,270 --> 00:58:37,040
Coo was laughing while showing it.

1249
00:58:37,040 --> 00:58:37,840
Who?

1250
00:58:37,840 --> 00:58:38,980
I didn't laugh.

1251
00:58:42,250 --> 00:58:44,550
Maybe you laughed?

1252
00:58:45,280 --> 00:58:48,520
Maybe you were laughing.

1253
00:58:49,190 --> 00:58:53,160
Earlier you were grinning.

1254
00:58:53,590 --> 00:58:55,260
It's not me.

1255
00:58:55,260 --> 00:58:57,560
I think he was laughing.

1256
00:58:57,560 --> 00:58:59,030
Who?

1257
00:58:59,030 --> 00:59:01,700
Coo-chan.

1258
00:59:01,700 --> 00:59:03,940
He was laughing afterwards.

1259
00:59:04,640 --> 00:59:08,610
You were laughing too much for the aftermath of an accomplishment.
Let's watch the replay.

1260
00:59:17,920 --> 00:59:23,020
He had been grinning for quite a while.

1261
00:59:24,020 --> 00:59:25,720
His smile was wonderful.

1262
00:59:27,030 --> 00:59:28,160
Orange card.

1263
00:59:29,690 --> 00:59:30,500
Watch out.

1264
00:59:30,600 --> 00:59:31,860
You did your best, though.

1265
00:59:32,900 --> 00:59:36,100
Someone will be in this room soon.

1266
00:59:37,300 --> 00:59:39,270
Someone will come.

1267
00:59:39,270 --> 00:59:40,740
I looked at the big hands and laughed.

1268
00:59:45,780 --> 00:59:47,780
What kind of punchline is a hand getting bigger?

1269
00:59:47,950 --> 00:59:52,050
You know best how hilarious your jokes are.

1270
01:00:07,400 --> 01:00:11,000
