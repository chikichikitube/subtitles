Gaki No Tsukai Presents
Never been there before, let's ask what the best 3 is!!

3
00:00:09,760 --> 00:00:12,290
Wow really this again, how many times now?

4
00:00:12,290 --> 00:00:13,730
4th time

5
00:00:13,960 --> 00:00:18,160
The 5 of them will go to a town they have never been
to before and ask the locals what the best 3 points are

6
00:00:18,660 --> 00:00:23,740
There are raffle tickets for every station
from 6 prefectures in the Tokyo area

7
00:00:23,840 --> 00:00:26,070
Shall we draw one then?

8
00:00:26,140 --> 00:00:27,810
Okay go for it Endo

9
00:00:27,810 --> 00:00:31,410
Idol Endo!

10
00:00:31,540 --> 00:00:32,980
- Everyone's idol

11
00:00:33,150 --> 00:00:34,980
Everyone wanks over you

12
00:00:36,580 --> 00:00:39,250
Okay this is where we will go

13
00:00:39,450 --> 00:00:41,720
Where will it be??
- He's short sighted!

14
00:00:41,890 --> 00:00:43,890
Sorry!
- Where?

15
00:00:43,960 --> 00:00:46,690
Nagata?

16
00:00:47,330 --> 00:00:49,160
-(staff) It's in Chiba

17
00:00:50,100 --> 00:00:51,800
Chiba AGAIN?!

18
00:00:51,930 --> 00:00:53,730
It's pretty far from here

19
00:00:54,530 --> 00:00:57,100
(Staff) It's on the Sotobou line

20
00:00:57,370 --> 00:00:59,640
It's here

21
00:01:00,310 --> 00:01:02,110
It's miles away!

22
00:01:02,240 --> 00:01:04,180
The Sotobou line

23
00:01:05,110 --> 00:01:06,180
- That's pretty far

24
00:01:06,450 --> 00:01:08,150
This is the station...

25
00:01:08,150 --> 00:01:11,350
Wow it's basic to say the least

26
00:01:11,350 --> 00:01:14,720
Look at this atmosphere!

27
00:01:15,020 --> 00:01:18,190
It'll be hard to even find people there!

28
00:01:18,360 --> 00:01:20,230
It's been decided!

29
00:01:20,330 --> 00:01:25,760
We are off to Nagata in Chiba!!

(One week later)
Well everyone we are here in Oamishirasato, Chiba prefecture

32
00:01:38,610 --> 00:01:42,580
The Japan Railways Sotobou Line Nagata Station
- Here we are...

33
00:01:42,910 --> 00:01:44,580
I'm a bit worried here

34
00:01:44,580 --> 00:01:47,720
We just got here by car

35
00:01:48,250 --> 00:01:50,820
There is literally no one in sight...

36
00:01:51,260 --> 00:01:52,960
Hardly none!

37
00:01:53,730 --> 00:01:57,030
Let's get to it and ask what's number 3 around here!

38
00:01:57,530 --> 00:02:00,070
There has been 2 trains in the last hour...

39
00:02:00,230 --> 00:02:02,230
People are coming out

40
00:02:02,230 --> 00:02:06,000
There's an archaeologist

41
00:02:06,610 --> 00:02:09,510
Do you have a moment to talk?

42
00:02:09,640 --> 00:02:13,450
We're shooting here today and...

43
00:02:13,880 --> 00:02:17,580
Here in Nagata... Nagata right?
- Is there any good places?

44
00:02:17,850 --> 00:02:19,950
How long have you lived here?

45
00:02:20,150 --> 00:02:23,890
Around 23 years

46
00:02:23,890 --> 00:02:26,960
How have the archaeological digs been going?

47
00:02:27,160 --> 00:02:28,990
- He's not an archaeologist!

48
00:02:29,130 --> 00:02:30,800
What line of work are you in?

49
00:02:31,030 --> 00:02:33,130
You have a great archaeologist air about you

50
00:02:33,130 --> 00:02:35,130
I draw for a living

51
00:02:36,000 --> 00:02:38,940
Have you heard of Nikakai? (Public body of art culture)

52
00:02:39,300 --> 00:02:41,140
They do all those amazing fine works

53
00:02:41,440 --> 00:02:44,580
I'm the Director of it.

54
00:02:47,310 --> 00:02:49,050
That's something else indeed!

55
00:02:49,920 --> 00:02:54,690
Just what will the Nikakai Director, Kawauchi-san, resident of 23 years

56
00:02:54,690 --> 00:02:58,060
Recommend as his number 3 attraction in Nagata?

57
00:02:58,260 --> 00:03:00,260
We basically go to places we haven't been

58
00:03:00,530 --> 00:03:03,530
And as the locals where the best places to go are

59
00:03:03,860 --> 00:03:06,400
So we would like to know your number 3

60
00:03:07,030 --> 00:03:09,840
Just one is good
- 3rd place

61
00:03:10,070 --> 00:03:11,670
Number 3

62
00:03:12,040 --> 00:03:15,440
There really isn't anything good around here...

63
00:03:15,610 --> 00:03:19,110
There must be!
- I'm sure there's something!

64
00:03:19,610 --> 00:03:21,950
When did you get here?
- Just now

65
00:03:22,310 --> 00:03:24,550
Why did you choose here?

66
00:03:29,190 --> 00:03:32,590
To put it simply... It's a batsu game

67
00:03:32,590 --> 00:03:34,230
It's not a punishment!

68
00:03:37,630 --> 00:03:38,530
I lied!

69
00:03:38,700 --> 00:03:41,370
Tanaka, go and ask that kid

70
00:03:42,470 --> 00:03:46,140
Excuse me! Can I talk to you for a moment please?

71
00:03:47,310 --> 00:03:49,310
Thank you!

72
00:03:49,940 --> 00:03:55,650
After giving up on Kawauchi-san, they move on to asking this school girl

73
00:03:56,380 --> 00:03:57,950
How old are you?

74
00:03:58,220 --> 00:04:00,350
2nd year High school

75
00:04:00,590 --> 00:04:02,120
Are you in a club?
- Yes

76
00:04:02,350 --> 00:04:04,360
You're pretty dirty

77
00:04:04,620 --> 00:04:08,160
You're covered in it! What club are you in?
- Climbing

78
00:04:08,360 --> 00:04:11,230
- Ah! That's why!

79
00:04:11,700 --> 00:04:16,540
We're looking for places in Nagata and asking what the best 3 are

80
00:04:17,140 --> 00:04:18,670
Anything is fine

81
00:04:18,670 --> 00:04:21,010
There isn't anything right?

82
00:04:21,210 --> 00:04:22,940
- No! She is just thinking!

83
00:04:23,210 --> 00:04:26,010
There has to be something!

84
00:04:27,680 --> 00:04:30,320
Recommendation...?
- Yeah! Anything about this town

85
00:04:31,550 --> 00:04:33,120
Anything is fine!

86
00:04:33,120 --> 00:04:35,150
Nothing coming out

87
00:04:38,560 --> 00:04:41,530
Sorry about all this sudden pressure!
- Where do you always go?

88
00:04:42,190 --> 00:04:44,730
Tell us where you hang out

89
00:04:50,170 --> 00:04:53,240
Really nothing huh...

90
00:04:53,540 --> 00:04:55,940
She's thinking about it!

91
00:04:58,940 --> 00:05:01,450
Suddenly during the interview...

92
00:05:02,050 --> 00:05:04,950
Hamada spots a new target!

93
00:05:05,950 --> 00:05:08,650
HEY KID get the fuck over here!!

94
00:05:08,920 --> 00:05:11,760
You will traumatize him

95
00:05:13,130 --> 00:05:15,130
It's good to gather a lot of information

96
00:05:17,460 --> 00:05:19,730
After parting ways with her, next up is...

97
00:05:20,230 --> 00:05:23,470
The questioning of the young lad Hamada collared

98
00:05:23,870 --> 00:05:24,970
How old are you?

99
00:05:25,240 --> 00:05:27,370
17

100
00:05:27,540 --> 00:05:29,640
Where you born around here?

101
00:05:30,840 --> 00:05:32,510
Yeah

102
00:05:32,810 --> 00:05:35,250
Well then...

103
00:05:35,480 --> 00:05:38,020
He's been here 17 years

104
00:05:38,950 --> 00:05:43,390
What could Haruhara-kun who was born and raised here, number 3 be??

105
00:05:44,020 --> 00:05:48,230
When I was a kid... We always used to play around

106
00:05:48,560 --> 00:05:51,230
You see that home center over there
- Yeah over that way

107
00:05:51,830 --> 00:05:55,000
There is a 5 parks close to that

108
00:05:55,130 --> 00:05:57,000
- There's a shit load of them!

109
00:05:57,270 --> 00:05:58,500
5?!

110
00:05:58,740 --> 00:06:01,170
I used to go and play there often

111
00:06:01,440 --> 00:06:04,210
Do the 5 of them all have individual names?

112
00:06:04,480 --> 00:06:08,110
Number 1, Number 2, Number 3...

113
00:06:09,450 --> 00:06:11,450
Isn't it just one park?!

114
00:06:11,680 --> 00:06:13,450
They're probably separated

115
00:06:13,450 --> 00:06:14,750
Let's go see it

116
00:06:14,890 --> 00:06:16,420
They might look different

117
00:06:16,590 --> 00:06:19,190
Which number is good?

118
00:06:20,860 --> 00:06:24,860
I suggest... Number...

119
00:06:24,960 --> 00:06:27,330
Number 1?

120
00:06:27,770 --> 00:06:30,100
It's definitely just one park!

121
00:06:30,970 --> 00:06:32,300
Sorry to hassle you

122
00:06:32,400 --> 00:06:34,470
We need to show the sign

123
00:06:34,710 --> 00:06:36,710
- Bet it shocked you huh?

124
00:06:37,110 --> 00:06:40,750
You got your lunch money on ya?

125
00:06:40,880 --> 00:06:43,920
Don't extort school kids!

126
00:06:44,550 --> 00:06:49,550
They make toward the park recommended by Haruhara-kun

127
00:06:51,920 --> 00:06:53,390
But en-route...

128
00:06:53,390 --> 00:06:57,630
Eh?! Look how difficult that is! What's with that one way

129
00:06:58,400 --> 00:07:00,400
Wow, that is backwards complicated

130
00:07:00,630 --> 00:07:02,200
That will get you panicked!

131
00:07:02,400 --> 00:07:04,400
How do you where?!

132
00:07:04,640 --> 00:07:06,640
Looks like a driving school!

133
00:07:06,870 --> 00:07:10,310
Where do you go?!

134
00:07:10,580 --> 00:07:15,750
Due to the complex nature of the intersection as go can see here

135
00:07:15,850 --> 00:07:20,290
After asking the local police, there was many incidents of wrong direction

136
00:07:20,450 --> 00:07:26,760
And so they erected 9 no entry signs to guide traffic around

137
00:07:28,730 --> 00:07:29,590
So you're meant to go straight?

138
00:07:31,160 --> 00:07:32,900
We're crossing here?

139
00:07:35,030 --> 00:07:37,800
He said behind the home center here?

140
00:07:38,670 --> 00:07:40,740
On the right hand side?

141
00:07:40,970 --> 00:07:42,970
He said the number 1 park was best

142
00:07:42,970 --> 00:07:46,010
"I like the Number 1 park" he said...

143
00:07:48,210 --> 00:07:50,220
What sort of park is it going to be!

144
00:07:51,320 --> 00:07:53,090
They walk for 5 minutes

145
00:07:57,120 --> 00:08:00,460
Here?
- It doesn't say number one though...

146
00:08:02,430 --> 00:08:03,230
Hello~

147
00:08:03,900 --> 00:08:05,060
Surprised to see us huh?

148
00:08:05,160 --> 00:08:07,170
Is this the Number one park?

149
00:08:07,500 --> 00:08:09,200
It is

150
00:08:09,670 --> 00:08:13,510
We asked what the good points of this neighborhood are...

151
00:08:13,510 --> 00:08:16,710
And this is where we landed first.

152
00:08:17,240 --> 00:08:21,580
The student said "I recommend the Number one park"

153
00:08:21,850 --> 00:08:24,020
So here we are but...

154
00:08:25,320 --> 00:08:27,450
Well... Yeah

155
00:08:27,750 --> 00:08:30,490
We made a tunnel in the sand box

156
00:08:30,660 --> 00:08:31,320
Really?!

157
00:08:31,460 --> 00:08:33,090
Have a look at it

158
00:08:33,230 --> 00:08:34,260
Is it okay to check it out?

159
00:08:37,500 --> 00:08:40,770
It's not even a recommendation!

160
00:08:40,770 --> 00:08:42,530
It's just something you did yourself!

161
00:08:50,180 --> 00:08:53,550
This is surly number 2 on the list

162
00:08:56,420 --> 00:08:58,950
We need to get an autograph

163
00:08:59,450 --> 00:09:02,750
It will crumble in the rain
- Isn't this wonderful!

164
00:09:02,890 --> 00:09:06,430
If you put some water in it, you can see it's connected!

165
00:09:08,560 --> 00:09:11,030
You can't imagine it at first glance

166
00:09:11,830 --> 00:09:15,330
You sure are a young looking mother!

167
00:09:15,670 --> 00:09:18,700
I'm the grandmother!

168
00:09:19,140 --> 00:09:20,740
Okay here we go watch

169
00:09:25,510 --> 00:09:28,050
Wow it really is

170
00:09:29,080 --> 00:09:31,480
Hold on a sec... This is surly number 1

171
00:09:31,480 --> 00:09:34,190
NO!

172
00:09:37,590 --> 00:09:40,430
And as expected, it was just a normal park

173
00:09:40,430 --> 00:09:43,630
But what with the residents recommend?

174
00:09:44,130 --> 00:09:48,000
Pretty much everyone just says nothing

175
00:09:48,270 --> 00:09:51,670
It's nothing but hesitations when answering!

176
00:09:52,000 --> 00:09:54,240
This tunnel is worthy!

177
00:09:55,340 --> 00:09:56,740
Number 3 at least

178
00:09:58,010 --> 00:10:00,280
Nagata Drive in-san...

179
00:10:00,410 --> 00:10:04,320
If you follow that road back there

180
00:10:04,650 --> 00:10:06,620
It's around there
- Drinve in?

181
00:10:06,750 --> 00:10:10,420
There is plenty of raw delicacies

182
00:10:11,420 --> 00:10:12,920
You might enjoy it

183
00:10:13,090 --> 00:10:16,060
What's the Drive-in? Like a service lay by?

184
00:10:16,230 --> 00:10:18,660
Just a restaurant

185
00:10:18,760 --> 00:10:21,070
It gets pretty busy in the evenings though

186
00:10:21,170 --> 00:10:24,870
Shall we go there and check out a bite to eat?
- Let's do that

187
00:10:26,840 --> 00:10:28,240
We will check it out

188
00:10:28,770 --> 00:10:32,840
But really, can we keep this tunnel on the list?

189
00:10:36,310 --> 00:10:42,990
The 5 of them make way toward the recommended Nagata Drive-in

190
00:10:45,060 --> 00:10:46,960
What`s behind that there?

191
00:10:47,090 --> 00:10:51,060
The name of the restaurant was Drive-in she said

192
00:10:51,730 --> 00:10:54,030
Why would you have a actual Drive-in there?

193
00:10:54,130 --> 00:10:56,000
Oh that's what it means!

194
00:10:56,170 --> 00:10:59,040
I asked if it was a service stop, she said no

195
00:10:59,440 --> 00:11:01,940
It's the name of the restaurant!

196
00:11:01,940 --> 00:11:04,080
The name!

197
00:11:04,610 --> 00:11:07,650
What was up with that 5 park after all

198
00:11:09,150 --> 00:11:10,680
I wonder what the rest where like

199
00:11:10,850 --> 00:11:14,620
Out of the 5 parks I like Number one he said

200
00:11:14,790 --> 00:11:16,920
That was Number one...

201
00:11:17,020 --> 00:11:20,960
It was just park play equipment

202
00:11:21,130 --> 00:11:24,530
I wonder what Number 5 would have been like!

203
00:11:27,530 --> 00:11:29,000
It's far huh

204
00:11:29,200 --> 00:11:31,500
I thought we would have been there by now

205
00:11:31,940 --> 00:11:33,840
Having walked this much

206
00:11:34,940 --> 00:11:39,110
But... I still can't see it
- Not at all

207
00:11:42,780 --> 00:11:44,580
Further?

208
00:11:45,880 --> 00:11:49,550
The sun is setting earlier and earlier

209
00:11:49,960 --> 00:11:52,060
How long are we gonna be round here

210
00:11:52,460 --> 00:11:53,590
Why?

211
00:11:53,690 --> 00:11:56,600
Because there's nothing here

212
00:11:56,660 --> 00:11:58,660
Ah, now you gone and said it

213
00:12:00,030 --> 00:12:02,670
But really, everyone is...

214
00:12:03,070 --> 00:12:05,370
Like...

215
00:12:05,570 --> 00:12:08,040
Damn this is narrow!

216
00:12:08,370 --> 00:12:09,940
It sure is

217
00:12:11,080 --> 00:12:13,080
We can only go single file

218
00:12:14,280 --> 00:12:17,950
Even after 10 minutes they have still not arrived

219
00:12:19,580 --> 00:12:20,450
But then!

220
00:12:28,930 --> 00:12:30,560
WTF!!

221
00:12:30,560 --> 00:12:31,860
I'm sorry!

222
00:12:32,060 --> 00:12:35,300
I was about to fall

223
00:12:35,400 --> 00:12:39,500
I thought there was a monster appearance, I'm sorry to startle you

224
00:12:40,740 --> 00:12:42,670
It took me by surprise

225
00:12:43,110 --> 00:12:45,710
Look, it says "Drive-in"

226
00:12:46,710 --> 00:12:49,580
They finally arrived at the Nagata Drive-in!

227
00:12:49,820 --> 00:12:51,820
It's open

228
00:12:51,980 --> 00:12:55,690
Is there seats? -I wonder if it's gonna be busy

229
00:12:56,090 --> 00:12:57,720
It's crowded!

230
00:12:57,890 --> 00:12:59,730
There's biker's here too

231
00:12:59,790 --> 00:13:01,630
A Harley!

232
00:13:01,860 --> 00:13:03,630
She said it was busy

233
00:13:07,670 --> 00:13:12,900
After getting the okay to film, they head inside!

234
00:13:15,270 --> 00:13:16,710
That took my by surprise

235
00:13:16,940 --> 00:13:20,750
Aren't you glad we walked, it gave it more merit

236
00:13:20,850 --> 00:13:23,050
Welcome!

237
00:13:23,280 --> 00:13:26,150
Thank you for coming!

238
00:13:26,490 --> 00:13:30,220
What is the recommended dish here?

239
00:13:31,360 --> 00:13:33,930
I recommend the sashimi

240
00:13:34,060 --> 00:13:39,100
We have a supplier that gets them direct
from the sea and brings them straight here

241
00:13:39,230 --> 00:13:42,530
Your on the borderline of crime then

242
00:13:42,700 --> 00:13:45,570
No, they have a legitimate supply route!

243
00:13:47,540 --> 00:13:49,340
How about Horse mackerel...

244
00:13:50,010 --> 00:13:51,680
Have you had the fried mackerel?

245
00:13:52,480 --> 00:13:54,580
It's delicious

246
00:13:54,680 --> 00:13:57,750
Yeah? Let's order one piece then
- One?!

247
00:13:59,020 --> 00:14:01,220
- One he said

248
00:14:01,890 --> 00:14:04,820
In the end they order the Sashimi and Aji fry

249
00:14:08,260 --> 00:14:10,700
No doubt about it...

250
00:14:10,860 --> 00:14:12,860
That pole is a real good one huh

251
00:14:13,700 --> 00:14:15,870
What's it here for?

252
00:14:15,870 --> 00:14:17,670
Shall we ask?

253
00:14:17,970 --> 00:14:20,640
It's nothing to do with the food

254
00:14:21,140 --> 00:14:22,640
Thre could be something to it

255
00:14:23,040 --> 00:14:24,240
There won't be.

256
00:14:24,340 --> 00:14:27,510
We have a question not related to the menu

257
00:14:28,780 --> 00:14:33,850
What's this pole about?

258
00:14:34,120 --> 00:14:38,260
There used to be wooden slats in here

259
00:14:38,790 --> 00:14:40,790
She's laughing while explaining!

260
00:14:42,960 --> 00:14:47,930
That's why there is a groove in it then!

261
00:14:48,330 --> 00:14:50,840
I see!
- That's why there is 2!

262
00:14:51,440 --> 00:14:54,510
It was connected lengthways across here

263
00:14:55,810 --> 00:14:58,010
Stop calling her out for every other thing

264
00:14:59,640 --> 00:15:01,110
Sorry to bother you

265
00:15:11,160 --> 00:15:14,330
If you look here...
What?!

266
00:15:16,030 --> 00:15:18,600
There are 3 phone jacks

267
00:15:20,230 --> 00:15:22,570
Shall we ask about it?
- She was just here!

268
00:15:22,970 --> 00:15:25,240
Why wait till she's gone to ask!

269
00:15:25,440 --> 00:15:26,740
But there's 3...

270
00:15:27,040 --> 00:15:29,810
This will definitely be the last

271
00:15:32,410 --> 00:15:34,610
I'm sorry but...

272
00:15:35,580 --> 00:15:40,320
I see you have 3 phone jacks on the wall here...

273
00:15:40,650 --> 00:15:42,650
That was...

274
00:15:43,590 --> 00:15:47,030
There used to be payphones there before

275
00:15:48,690 --> 00:15:50,860
3 of them?

276
00:15:50,930 --> 00:15:52,830
Just one...

277
00:15:52,960 --> 00:15:56,270
But there was 3 just in case, like...

278
00:15:56,600 --> 00:15:58,470
So that's how it was

279
00:16:00,570 --> 00:16:02,340
I'm sorry but...

280
00:16:02,940 --> 00:16:03,810
What's this about

281
00:16:03,810 --> 00:16:05,180
Give it a rest already!!

282
00:16:05,240 --> 00:16:06,750
It's like that for a reason!!

283
00:16:08,910 --> 00:16:11,620
So it doesn't drip I guess

284
00:16:11,750 --> 00:16:13,750
I'm sorry for the bother

285
00:16:15,250 --> 00:16:17,690
She seems a bit flustered and busy...

286
00:16:19,790 --> 00:16:22,560
Because you keep calling her over and over!

287
00:16:24,330 --> 00:16:28,530
I want to get this shoot finished up before it gets dark...

288
00:16:28,670 --> 00:16:31,570
There might be something good after dark though

289
00:16:31,870 --> 00:16:33,710
Like an amazing illumination

290
00:16:33,710 --> 00:16:35,710
There isn't anything like that.

291
00:16:38,940 --> 00:16:42,180
Something of a public viewing spot

292
00:16:42,280 --> 00:16:44,050
In that park

293
00:16:46,080 --> 00:16:49,760
A celebrity from round these parts

294
00:16:49,960 --> 00:16:52,890
Shall we enquire?
Are you local to the are?

295
00:16:53,330 --> 00:16:55,690
We're from Mobara (The next town)

296
00:16:55,930 --> 00:16:58,930
That place is pretty big

297
00:16:59,400 --> 00:17:07,440
Yuko Ogura is a former early 2000 idol from that town that had some kind of imaginary star named the Korin Star http://ja.uncyclopedia.info/wiki/こりん星

298
00:16:59,830 --> 00:17:03,170
Mobara has that star planet Yukorin

299
00:17:03,600 --> 00:17:06,570
There is a planet there?!

300
00:17:11,310 --> 00:17:15,510
There is a star in the earth?!

301
00:17:18,150 --> 00:17:20,750
And so..

302
00:17:21,620 --> 00:17:23,990
Sorry to have kept you waiting

303
00:17:33,370 --> 00:17:36,940
This looks amazing

304
00:17:47,250 --> 00:17:50,550
Assorted Sashimi

305
00:17:55,420 --> 00:17:57,890
Big AjiFry

306
00:18:06,670 --> 00:18:07,900
Delicious!

307
00:18:08,530 --> 00:18:10,240
This tuna is great!

308
00:18:11,070 --> 00:18:13,710
It's soft as anything

309
00:18:20,780 --> 00:18:23,550
You should all try it

310
00:18:24,980 --> 00:18:28,550
Next is the famous AjiFry

311
00:18:40,100 --> 00:18:43,500
This is seriously good!

312
00:18:47,710 --> 00:18:49,140
Great!

313
00:18:50,180 --> 00:18:51,910
Look at this

314
00:18:54,650 --> 00:18:56,850
Tuna like this?!

315
00:19:08,430 --> 00:19:09,900
Can I ask something?

316
00:19:10,360 --> 00:19:12,430
How many years has this been here?

317
00:19:12,900 --> 00:19:14,900
He is second generation

318
00:19:15,430 --> 00:19:17,440
He's 3rd

319
00:19:20,010 --> 00:19:22,110
And we're siblings

320
00:19:24,240 --> 00:19:26,510
She's a big fan of yours!!

321
00:19:27,010 --> 00:19:29,650
Do you want to eat with us?

322
00:19:34,650 --> 00:19:38,890
And so 3rd on the list is Nagata Drive-in

323
00:19:39,360 --> 00:19:44,830
In business for 60 years, this place gets the official recommendation!

324
00:19:46,870 --> 00:19:49,970
Is it really okay to give this number 3?

325
00:19:52,100 --> 00:19:56,840
This can be first, the tunnel 2nd...

326
00:19:57,010 --> 00:20:00,010
And the archaeologist 3rd.

327
00:20:00,010 --> 00:20:02,010
He's not an archaeologist

328
00:20:02,010 --> 00:20:05,620
He's not an archaeologist!

329
00:20:06,150 --> 00:20:09,420
I'll go and ask some of the other customers

330
00:20:10,020 --> 00:20:16,400
They ask the guest for their number 2 recommendation

331
00:20:17,430 --> 00:20:24,600
It's called Arere-chan house, you can roast your own stuff there

332
00:20:24,600 --> 00:20:27,540
In Nagata?
- Yes

333
00:20:27,540 --> 00:20:33,050
They have home made soft cream and hand toasted senbei also

334
00:20:33,050 --> 00:20:34,650
I highly recommend it

335
00:20:35,010 --> 00:20:41,920
And so they make their way to Arare-chan's house by car

336
00:20:45,220 --> 00:20:47,960
(Staff) Please wear your seat belts properly

337
00:20:48,230 --> 00:20:51,530
No belt is best right?
- It's better to wear it

338
00:20:54,930 --> 00:20:56,940
We can't not wear it?

339
00:20:57,570 --> 00:20:59,570
You have to wear it

340
00:21:00,670 --> 00:21:02,640
It's okay to smoke right?

341
00:21:02,640 --> 00:21:04,440
You can't smoke here

342
00:21:04,910 --> 00:21:07,910
It's better not to wear a seat belt right?
- No, you have to wear it

343
00:21:08,950 --> 00:21:10,850
It's okay to just go home like this right?

344
00:21:10,850 --> 00:21:13,350
I don't know about that

345
00:21:13,790 --> 00:21:17,190
I'm glad it was delicious

346
00:21:18,720 --> 00:21:20,290
Endo, didn't you drink a beer?

347
00:21:20,290 --> 00:21:22,290
I did not drink!!

348
00:21:22,460 --> 00:21:26,300
Didn't you have a Mizore Sake? (A partially frozen sake slushie)

349
00:21:26,630 --> 00:21:28,330
I didn't have a drink

350
00:21:28,730 --> 00:21:31,500
I definitely won't tell anyone

351
00:21:31,670 --> 00:21:36,070
Well you know for sure in these recent times there has been drinks

352
00:21:37,280 --> 00:21:40,910
You know that thing, well we didn't have it today but...

353
00:21:41,250 --> 00:21:43,550
When someone says "Please shake my hand"

354
00:21:43,550 --> 00:21:45,550
I do it but...

355
00:21:45,980 --> 00:21:49,050
Do you get people that squeeze it as hard as possible?

356
00:21:49,520 --> 00:21:52,560
It's just because you're ripped now Matsumoto-san

357
00:21:53,590 --> 00:21:58,960
Nah! It's nothing like I start arguing with them or anything but...

358
00:21:59,460 --> 00:22:02,000
You'd be mistaken for them doing it out of spite

359
00:22:02,500 --> 00:22:04,240
Like what, what you starting?

360
00:22:04,570 --> 00:22:07,540
I don't think it's on purpose to that extent

361
00:22:07,870 --> 00:22:10,710
Not squeezing the life out of me but, still hard gripping

362
00:22:10,910 --> 00:22:13,850
You can feel the rage

363
00:22:16,380 --> 00:22:19,420
Like I'm unable to move for a moment

364
00:22:20,050 --> 00:22:21,550
WTF?!

365
00:22:21,550 --> 00:22:23,620
There are those times indeed

366
00:22:23,620 --> 00:22:26,360
No, not there are those times

367
00:22:27,830 --> 00:22:29,630
He got caught out

368
00:22:29,860 --> 00:22:33,230
Conversely, I have many of the opposite

369
00:22:33,900 --> 00:22:35,930
Okay enough's enough~!

370
00:22:38,600 --> 00:22:41,210
It's pretty much all guys, gripping like fuck

371
00:22:43,910 --> 00:22:45,910
Oh! Yamasaki-san!
- Hello

372
00:22:46,010 --> 00:22:49,050
Is it okay if I shake your hand?
I'm such a huge fan!

373
00:22:53,090 --> 00:22:55,350
They do it that much!?

374
00:22:58,320 --> 00:23:00,460
Matsumoto-san please stop that!

375
00:23:00,760 --> 00:23:01,960
It's like the Hulk

376
00:23:02,130 --> 00:23:04,600
Wouldn't it piss you off!?

377
00:23:04,700 --> 00:23:06,230
I didn't like that just then

378
00:23:06,300 --> 00:23:10,470
You can't help but forgive them because they're your fans like...

379
00:23:11,900 --> 00:23:15,370
"I'm a huge fan! I've seen all your shows!"

380
00:23:15,410 --> 00:23:18,410
"I got all the DVD's too!"

381
00:23:18,840 --> 00:23:20,850
Well, I'm grateful for that of course...

382
00:23:21,050 --> 00:23:23,780
Then they shake your hand as hard as possible!

383
00:23:23,980 --> 00:23:26,320
I just don't fucking get it!?

384
00:23:31,990 --> 00:23:34,560
I thought it would be me that gets got

385
00:23:35,590 --> 00:23:37,600
I can feel the overwhelming pressure here

386
00:23:38,700 --> 00:23:42,230
Next week! The conclusion of Nagata station Best 3!

387
00:23:48,110 --> 00:23:51,240
The 5 of them forget the shoot and become regular tourists

388
00:23:59,050 --> 00:24:03,690
But will they be able to draw a close on the best 3!?
