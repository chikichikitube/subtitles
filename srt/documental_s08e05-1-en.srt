Thanks For Watching!

2
00:00:24,020 --> 00:00:27,120
"So Fujimon, yeah, yeah."

3
00:00:27,390 --> 00:00:30,490
"He doesn't strike me as a winner."

4
00:00:30,560 --> 00:00:31,860
"In my opinion."

5
00:00:31,930 --> 00:00:33,830
"He's more of a supporting character."

6
00:00:33,900 --> 00:00:37,300
And even then sometimes I wonder in what way.

7
00:00:37,370 --> 00:00:38,870
— Come on, do it already!
— Why third place?

8
00:00:38,930 --> 00:00:40,200
Do it in any case!
Don't look!

9
00:00:40,270 --> 00:00:41,440
I'm not looking!

10
00:00:41,500 --> 00:00:42,740
— Get it right!
— Start from the third place!

11
00:00:42,810 --> 00:00:43,840
Just get it right!

12
00:00:43,910 --> 00:00:47,200
A supporting actor someone you want to take out as soon as possible, right?

13
00:00:47,200 --> 00:00:49,650
Even when you're feeling about to laugh

14
00:00:49,750 --> 00:00:53,000
You can tell early on if someone is trying something funny

15
00:00:53,020 --> 00:00:57,890
So targetting a single person,

16
00:00:58,290 --> 00:01:01,320
and going one on one against them,

17
00:01:01,390 --> 00:01:03,360
is pretty common from the more skilled people.

18
00:01:03,430 --> 00:01:05,460
There are quite a number of strong people, I think...

19
00:01:05,760 --> 00:01:09,000
I try to get as many different people involved, though.

20
00:01:09,060 --> 00:01:10,500
It's going to hurt like hell, right?

21
00:01:17,600 --> 00:01:18,900
He laughed, yeah!

22
00:02:28,310 --> 00:02:29,480
He's laughing a little.

23
00:02:29,810 --> 00:02:30,880
Just a little smile.

24
00:02:30,950 --> 00:02:33,120
He's laughing, yeah.

25
00:02:33,180 --> 00:02:34,520
Seiji, you're out!

26
00:02:34,580 --> 00:02:36,390
The Chihara brothers are out!

27
00:02:36,450 --> 00:02:37,450
That's right!

28
00:02:37,520 --> 00:02:39,360
Rock, paper, scissors!

29
00:02:39,420 --> 00:02:41,320
Rock, paper, scissors!

30
00:02:41,390 --> 00:02:42,460
— Rock, paper—

31
00:02:45,590 --> 00:02:47,630
—This is bad!
—Whoa!

32
00:02:47,700 --> 00:02:49,730
There it is, there it is!

33
00:02:49,800 --> 00:02:51,670
There's no way!

34
00:03:00,780 --> 00:03:03,350
So Cookie has an orange?!

35
00:03:03,750 --> 00:03:06,280
Cookie and Oshiro-san have...

36
00:03:06,350 --> 00:03:07,580
some pretty good point leads.

37
00:03:07,650 --> 00:03:10,550
He has something again!

38
00:03:10,620 --> 00:03:11,650
Karuta?

39
00:03:11,950 --> 00:03:13,990
Um, Cookie! Come here...

40
00:03:14,060 --> 00:03:15,060
What is it?
Just come here...

41
00:03:15,120 --> 00:03:16,530
Oh, Fujita!

42
00:03:16,590 --> 00:03:17,930
—Kawahara-san!
—Hey! (Editor's Note: 1)

43
00:03:17,990 --> 00:03:19,430
How you doing?

44
00:03:19,500 --> 00:03:21,660
—I'm doing great!
—Why is he here?

45
00:03:21,730 --> 00:03:23,400
—It's like foreshadowing.
—It's foreshadowing, yeah.

46
00:03:23,470 --> 00:03:25,730
Hey, there!
How have you been doing lately?

47
00:03:25,800 --> 00:03:26,800
I had a performance recently!

48
00:03:26,870 --> 00:03:27,870
—Have you been performing?
—Yeah!

49
00:03:27,940 --> 00:03:29,140
I used to visit a lot long time ago!

50
00:03:29,200 --> 00:03:31,140
—Thank you so much!
—Back in Kanpachi!

51
00:03:31,210 --> 00:03:32,010
I see, thank you so much!

52
00:03:32,010 --> 00:03:33,480
You're so loud!
I see, thank you so much!

53
00:03:33,840 --> 00:03:35,310
—Thank you!
—Back in Kanpachi, right?

54
00:03:35,380 --> 00:03:37,780
—Thank you so much!
—And I think in Kannana too?

55
00:03:37,850 --> 00:03:39,550
It's okay. Don't worry about it.

56
00:03:39,620 --> 00:03:40,820
It's okay?

57
00:03:41,580 --> 00:03:43,450
He was the boss with Mixi?

58
00:03:43,520 --> 00:03:44,650
—Huh?
—That's right!

59
00:03:44,720 --> 00:03:46,920
—Mixi?
—With Chance...

60
00:03:48,360 --> 00:03:50,160
—It's hilarious!
—Mixi...

61
00:03:50,230 --> 00:03:51,530
I'm Chance Oshiro.

62
00:03:51,860 --> 00:03:53,460
Ah, ah! Oshiro!

63
00:03:53,530 --> 00:03:54,900
—You remember?
—Yeah, yeah.

64
00:03:54,960 --> 00:03:57,300
I used to be asked if I was Aoki Chance's disciple.

65
00:03:57,370 --> 00:04:00,170
Yeah, I used to be W Kenji's disciple, actually.

66
00:04:00,240 --> 00:04:02,170
Who's W Kenji?

67
00:04:02,240 --> 00:04:03,440
You don't know W Kenji?

68
00:04:03,510 --> 00:04:04,610
The guy with Moriwaki-san?

69
00:04:04,670 --> 00:04:05,710
No, no, W Kenji is...

70
00:04:05,770 --> 00:04:08,140
the guy that goes like "ain't it so?!" from Miyagi prefecture.

71
00:04:08,310 --> 00:04:09,310
Huh?

72
00:04:09,380 --> 00:04:11,180
You don't know W Kenji? He does Manzai.

73
00:04:11,250 --> 00:04:13,050
—I don't know him, sorry.
—Who was that?

74
00:04:13,320 --> 00:04:14,820
There was Miyagi Kenji, Azuma Kenji—

75
00:04:14,880 --> 00:04:17,220
Why did you come here today?

76
00:04:17,290 --> 00:04:18,720
I'm just here to...

77
00:04:18,790 --> 00:04:20,490
—Help Fujita?
—Huh?

78
00:04:21,190 --> 00:04:23,260
Fujita?

79
00:04:23,590 --> 00:04:24,960
No, no, not at all.

80
00:04:25,030 --> 00:04:26,600
You're in red today?

81
00:04:26,660 --> 00:04:28,660
You didn't know I like red?

82
00:04:28,730 --> 00:04:30,270
You saw him wearing red, though!

83
00:04:30,330 --> 00:04:31,730
—I'm sorry.
—That's just half of it!

84
00:04:31,800 --> 00:04:35,600
My glasses are red, my T-shirt is red,
and my shoes are red!

85
00:04:35,670 --> 00:04:37,540
Because the company's numbers are in red, of course!

86
00:04:37,710 --> 00:04:39,170
—For real
—You doing okay?

87
00:04:39,410 --> 00:04:40,980
—What was that?
—The company is in the red

88
00:04:41,040 --> 00:04:43,850
That aside, I'm going to make some ramen now.

89
00:04:43,910 --> 00:04:45,010
Alright then!

90
00:04:45,080 --> 00:04:46,850
—The boss himself?
—Can you even eat anymore?

91
00:04:46,920 --> 00:04:48,480
—Um, boss?
—Yes?

92
00:04:48,550 --> 00:04:50,450
How long are you going to take?

93
00:04:50,690 --> 00:04:52,760
I'm just gonna do it in a flash!

94
00:04:52,820 --> 00:04:54,590
It's just that we don't have any water boiling.

95
00:04:54,660 --> 00:04:56,460
Can you stay around here in the meantime?

96
00:04:56,530 --> 00:04:58,490
You're not boiling water yet?

97
00:04:58,560 --> 00:05:00,130
We have to get it boiling soon.

98
00:05:00,200 --> 00:05:01,600
I'll get that done, then.

99
00:05:01,660 --> 00:05:02,970
We just have to get this here and boil it.

100
00:05:03,200 --> 00:05:05,200
—Soup?
—With this.

101
00:05:05,270 --> 00:05:07,440
—We don't have soup?
—This is the soup.

102
00:05:07,500 --> 00:05:09,300
—That?
—Yeah.

103
00:05:09,370 --> 00:05:11,070
Wait, can I ask—

104
00:05:11,140 --> 00:05:12,470
—ask you to talk quietly?
—Yeah.

105
00:05:12,540 --> 00:05:14,380
—Who's speaking loudly?
—Yeah, they're too loud.

106
00:05:14,440 --> 00:05:16,410
Sorry, can we have you do that?

107
00:05:16,680 --> 00:05:18,750
The ramen?

108
00:05:18,950 --> 00:05:20,180
No, you're making ramen here?

109
00:05:20,250 --> 00:05:21,250
Wasn't it Chance's turn?

110
00:05:21,320 --> 00:05:22,380
Let's do the ramen there, then.

111
00:05:22,450 --> 00:05:23,950
—I thought it was Chance's...
—Yeah...

112
00:05:24,490 --> 00:05:25,990
Do you have a moment?

113
00:05:26,060 --> 00:05:28,360
This looks like it's going to take quite a while.

114
00:05:28,560 --> 00:05:30,130
Boss, are you taking long?

115
00:05:30,460 --> 00:05:32,530
—No, no, I'm just—
—Wait, boss...

116
00:05:32,590 --> 00:05:34,800
Can you give us a tuning note?

117
00:05:34,860 --> 00:05:36,130
You think you can play a game with us, boss?

118
00:05:36,200 --> 00:05:37,470
The boss is just...

119
00:05:37,530 --> 00:05:38,970
The boss has to pour the water and—

120
00:05:39,030 --> 00:05:40,040
I don't mind singing.

121
00:05:40,100 --> 00:05:42,100
—No, that's just—
—Okay, just one song.

122
00:05:42,170 --> 00:05:47,380
Ave Maria!

123
00:05:47,440 --> 00:05:53,080
Jungfrau mild.

124
00:05:53,250 --> 00:05:54,520
Amazing

125
00:05:54,580 --> 00:05:57,690
Boss...
Um... that was good.

126
00:05:57,750 --> 00:05:59,150
He wants to become an opera singer.

127
00:05:59,220 --> 00:06:00,360
—Huh?

128
00:06:00,420 --> 00:06:01,860
Once the ramen's done...

129
00:06:01,920 --> 00:06:03,960
Please leave it until after it's done.

130
00:06:04,690 --> 00:06:06,500
Can I ask you to sing one more?

131
00:06:06,830 --> 00:06:09,600
Toreador, en garde

132
00:06:09,600 --> 00:06:10,600
—Ah! I know this song!
—Toreador, en garde

133
00:06:10,670 --> 00:06:14,170
toreador, toreador,

134
00:06:14,470 --> 00:06:18,210
Et songe bien,
oui songe en combattant

135
00:06:18,270 --> 00:06:22,080
Qu'un oeil noir te regarde

136
00:06:24,250 --> 00:06:29,150
Torador, l'amour,
l'amour t'attend!

137
00:06:29,220 --> 00:06:30,790
Okay, thank you very much!

138
00:06:32,920 --> 00:06:35,690
That's enough, that's enough!

139
00:06:35,760 --> 00:06:36,860
Okay, Karuta! (EN: 2)

140
00:06:40,900 --> 00:06:42,160
"A red cock, huh?!"

141
00:06:43,300 --> 00:06:46,000
Can you stop singing that already?

142
00:06:48,270 --> 00:06:49,270
"U"!

143
00:06:49,270 --> 00:06:51,500
"Your wife's nipples look like an eel"

144
00:06:51,670 --> 00:06:52,710
"Ke"!

145
00:06:52,710 --> 00:06:52,780
"Kept three markers inside my asshole!"

146
00:06:52,780 --> 00:06:54,140
Come on, just...
"Kept three markers inside my asshole!"

147
00:06:59,520 --> 00:07:01,750
Stay quiet... can you stay quiet? Hey!

148
00:07:02,050 --> 00:07:03,050
"Ya"!

149
00:07:03,400 --> 00:07:06,050
"I'm gonna gobble that soft cock right up!"

150
00:07:11,530 --> 00:07:13,200
A red cock, huh?

151
00:07:25,260 --> 00:07:27,500
"Tempting me to jerk off? Guess I'll oblige!"

152
00:07:27,510 --> 00:07:29,580
"K.O for a smaller girl with just a right jab!"

153
00:07:30,350 --> 00:07:32,310
"Mamo Meemo"

154
00:07:37,550 --> 00:07:39,620
—Did he really say all that?
—He did.

155
00:07:39,690 --> 00:07:42,120
Even that thing about the small girl and the jab.

156
00:07:44,060 --> 00:07:46,230
Then this is what we have.

157
00:07:46,300 --> 00:07:48,500
—You're still going on about that?
—We have a lot of them!

158
00:07:48,560 --> 00:07:50,130
That's enough already, Coo...

159
00:07:50,330 --> 00:07:53,300
This is a collection of all my past masterpieces.

160
00:07:53,370 --> 00:07:54,840
—The best of the best.
—Right.

161
00:07:55,200 --> 00:07:56,810
This is my masterpiece.

162
00:07:57,700 --> 00:07:58,040
"The wife caught me spanking that ass and now I'm dead."

163
00:07:58,040 --> 00:08:00,110
That's not even Karuta anymore.
"The wife caught me spanking that ass and now I'm dead."

164
00:08:00,110 --> 00:08:00,510
"The wife caught me spanking that ass and now I'm dead."

165
00:08:00,510 --> 00:08:01,710
What's this one?
"The wife caught me spanking that ass and now I'm dead."

166
00:08:01,710 --> 00:08:01,780
"The wife caught me spanking that ass and now I'm dead."

167
00:08:01,780 --> 00:08:02,040
—An old saying?
—An old saying.
"The wife caught me spanking that ass and now I'm dead."

168
00:08:02,040 --> 00:08:03,110
"Is this child a creampie?"
—An old saying?
—An old saying.

169
00:08:03,110 --> 00:08:03,280
"Is this child a creampie?"

170
00:08:03,280 --> 00:08:04,680
Come and read this.
"Is this child a creampie?"

171
00:08:05,080 --> 00:08:06,150
Okay, it's done!

172
00:08:06,220 --> 00:08:07,480
—That was quick.
—Great!

173
00:08:07,680 --> 00:08:09,120
—It's done!
—Thank you very much.

174
00:08:09,180 --> 00:08:10,320
I'm going to dig in, then.

175
00:08:10,690 --> 00:08:12,420
I don't think he said that.

176
00:08:12,490 --> 00:08:13,690
Alright!

177
00:08:13,760 --> 00:08:14,920
He definitely did say this one, though.

178
00:08:14,990 --> 00:08:16,160
Liar.

179
00:08:16,590 --> 00:08:18,590
—Where are the condiments?
—No way!

180
00:08:18,660 --> 00:08:22,000
Um... It's only for Fujita?

181
00:08:22,460 --> 00:08:23,770
Only for Fujita?

182
00:08:25,430 --> 00:08:27,240
You all want some?

183
00:08:27,440 --> 00:08:30,040
No, I'm fine, really.
Besides, we're having pizza.

184
00:08:30,110 --> 00:08:31,840
You have to eat that before the pizza gets here.

185
00:08:31,910 --> 00:08:34,410
—Right.
—It's just noodles?

186
00:08:39,550 --> 00:08:41,980
These noodles are pretty stiff.

187
00:08:42,320 --> 00:08:43,320
What about the condiments?

188
00:08:44,990 --> 00:08:46,960
I don't really like them.

189
00:08:47,020 --> 00:08:48,620
It's bad?

190
00:08:50,260 --> 00:08:52,160
You shouldn't say anything, since he's a pro.

191
00:08:52,530 --> 00:08:53,560
Right.

192
00:08:54,860 --> 00:08:56,300
It's all chunky. Look.

193
00:08:56,370 --> 00:08:58,470
Can you sing this in some pretty voice?

194
00:08:58,530 --> 00:09:00,440
In that opera voice from earlier.

195
00:09:01,070 --> 00:09:05,870
Pubes!

196
00:09:08,240 --> 00:09:11,180
K.O for a smaller girl

197
00:09:11,250 --> 00:09:17,590
with just a right jab!

198
00:09:20,720 --> 00:09:24,260
A red cock!

199
00:09:24,330 --> 00:09:31,130
Oh, yeah!

200
00:09:35,540 --> 00:09:38,910
Soft cock!

201
00:09:38,970 --> 00:09:45,350
I'm gonna gobble it right up!

202
00:09:45,810 --> 00:09:47,080
Okay!

203
00:09:47,620 --> 00:09:49,150
—Something came out of your mouth.
—Whoa!

204
00:09:49,220 --> 00:09:50,420
That was pretty rough.

205
00:09:50,490 --> 00:09:54,890
Fluffy pubes

206
00:09:54,960 --> 00:09:59,330
look delicious!

207
00:10:01,830 --> 00:10:02,930
You're getting a bit annoying, boss.

208
00:10:03,000 --> 00:10:06,300
Your wife's nipples

209
00:10:06,370 --> 00:10:08,370
look like

210
00:10:08,570 --> 00:10:11,270
an eel!

211
00:10:11,340 --> 00:10:13,040
Boss, wait, boss...

212
00:10:13,110 --> 00:10:15,240
Can you stay quiet for a little while?

213
00:10:16,040 --> 00:10:18,610
What was that?

214
00:10:19,050 --> 00:10:20,050
—Sorry?
—Huh?

215
00:10:20,280 --> 00:10:22,720
What's that?

216
00:10:22,780 --> 00:10:24,150
Guess we don't need the harmonica, then.

217
00:10:24,220 --> 00:10:28,320
Boss, please come here, boss.

218
00:10:29,290 --> 00:10:30,990
You want more noodles?

219
00:10:31,060 --> 00:10:33,060
—You don't want the harmonica?
—Do it one more time.

220
00:10:35,460 --> 00:10:37,370
—You're so talented!
—Boss, please sit down!

221
00:10:37,430 --> 00:10:39,600
What's going on?

222
00:10:52,310 --> 00:10:53,320
Boss...

223
00:10:56,280 --> 00:10:58,220
Leave it in there.

224
00:10:58,490 --> 00:11:00,060
—Okay.
—Here we go.

225
00:11:04,160 --> 00:11:05,290
You made a sound.

226
00:11:06,500 --> 00:11:08,060
You want more noodles?

227
00:11:09,130 --> 00:11:11,530
—I'm having some.
—More noodles, more noodles.

228
00:11:11,600 --> 00:11:13,970
It's just that you had left...

229
00:11:14,840 --> 00:11:15,940
More noodles.

230
00:11:18,340 --> 00:11:19,340
Yeah.

231
00:11:20,780 --> 00:11:23,610
Patience!

232
00:11:23,680 --> 00:11:27,880
For anal, my anal will...

233
00:11:27,950 --> 00:11:34,260
immediately stretch!

234
00:11:39,190 --> 00:11:42,100
—My anal will...
—Just anal is fine.

235
00:11:42,160 --> 00:11:44,500
Anal, anal.

236
00:11:44,570 --> 00:11:49,370
Anal! Anal! Anal!

237
00:11:49,440 --> 00:11:53,210
So uh, have you heard about the merger (EN: 3)

238
00:11:53,280 --> 00:11:55,380
—between All Nippon Airways and Japan Airlines?
—I didn't know about that.

239
00:11:55,440 --> 00:11:57,450
ANA and JAL will join to form ANAL.

240
00:11:59,710 --> 00:12:02,380
—ANA, right?
—That's cruel!

241
00:12:02,850 --> 00:12:04,420
—Boss...
—It just fits perfectly.

242
00:12:04,490 --> 00:12:05,790
How long are you staying?

243
00:12:05,850 --> 00:12:07,990
Until... you know, that.

244
00:12:08,060 --> 00:12:10,490
Alright then, I'm leaving with a Pei-Pei!

245
00:12:10,560 --> 00:12:12,590
Pei! Pei! Pei!

246
00:12:12,590 --> 00:12:13,860
Daisuke...

247
00:12:13,930 --> 00:12:15,630
The ass goes pei, pei!

248
00:12:15,960 --> 00:12:17,570
—That's not funny at all.
—Thank you very much.

249
00:12:17,970 --> 00:12:19,730
—Thank you very much.
—Thank you for the attention.

250
00:12:19,800 --> 00:12:21,940
Spontaneous gags like that aren't much fun at all.

251
00:12:22,200 --> 00:12:24,340
Thank you, thank you!

252
00:12:24,410 --> 00:12:25,670
—Thank you.
—Pei pei!

253
00:12:27,580 --> 00:12:28,580
Why did he come here?

254
00:12:28,640 --> 00:12:30,550
Why did you call him here anyways?

255
00:12:30,810 --> 00:12:32,480
Everything's backfiring today.

256
00:12:33,580 --> 00:12:35,520
Well... he's pretty popular, at least.

257
00:12:35,580 --> 00:12:36,690
—That's true.
—No, no.

258
00:12:36,750 --> 00:12:37,750
I guess it was fine, though.

259
00:12:37,820 --> 00:12:39,690
So I had a kid,

260
00:12:39,750 --> 00:12:42,320
you guys wanna look at her face?

261
00:12:42,390 --> 00:12:43,390
We're good.

262
00:12:43,460 --> 00:12:44,730
I don't think you should.

263
00:12:44,790 --> 00:12:49,060
She's still only three, so I think it should be fine.

264
00:12:49,130 --> 00:12:52,130
I took a lot of pictures.

265
00:12:52,200 --> 00:12:53,200
She's super cute!

266
00:12:53,370 --> 00:12:54,570
She's pretty cute.

267
00:12:54,640 --> 00:12:56,510
—She looks like you.
—She's a girl, but yeah.

268
00:12:56,570 --> 00:12:59,240
She really looks like you, and she's super cute.

269
00:12:59,310 --> 00:13:01,740
Kids are usually really ugly at this age.

270
00:13:01,810 --> 00:13:03,280
They look like gorillas and stuff.

271
00:13:03,350 --> 00:13:05,050
—Or like sumo wrestlers.
—Right?

272
00:13:05,280 --> 00:13:07,480
—Super cute.
—This is from when she was born.

273
00:13:09,050 --> 00:13:11,150
That's enough, right?

274
00:13:11,220 --> 00:13:13,590
—She's cute.
—We already know she's cute.

275
00:13:16,220 --> 00:13:17,360
I'm so jealous!

276
00:13:17,430 --> 00:13:20,100
What's this?
What's going on here?

277
00:13:20,630 --> 00:13:22,830
—It's fine, right?
—I guess, I don't care, yeah.

278
00:13:22,900 --> 00:13:24,970
That looks good! Who took that picture?

279
00:13:25,770 --> 00:13:27,600
—That was me.
—It's a selfie?

280
00:13:27,870 --> 00:13:29,340
Show us the kiss one more time.

281
00:13:29,600 --> 00:13:31,210
He has plenty of kissing pictures.
Why do you want to see that?

282
00:13:32,640 --> 00:13:33,980
You can see the kiss full on.

283
00:13:34,040 --> 00:13:35,140
Okay, sorry.

284
00:13:35,840 --> 00:13:37,450
That's pretty cute.

285
00:13:37,510 --> 00:13:39,950
—Your wife is pretty cute.
—Being married sounds good.

286
00:13:40,750 --> 00:13:42,220
What's this?

287
00:13:42,420 --> 00:13:43,590
Show them to us one by one!

288
00:13:43,650 --> 00:13:44,990
That's good, I'm so jealous!

289
00:13:45,050 --> 00:13:46,560
Whoa! Full on kiss!

290
00:13:46,620 --> 00:13:48,820
That's a nice background.

291
00:13:48,890 --> 00:13:50,260
Yeah, it sure is.
That's Paris?

292
00:13:50,330 --> 00:13:51,930
—You want this?
—Thank you.

293
00:13:51,990 --> 00:13:54,400
—It's Thai viagra.
—Whoa!

294
00:13:55,560 --> 00:13:56,870
—This is pretty bad.
—Thai viagra?

295
00:13:56,930 --> 00:13:58,070
—It's fine.
—You don't want it?

296
00:13:58,400 --> 00:14:01,170
Doesn't viagra make it super hard?

297
00:14:01,240 --> 00:14:02,840
You've had viagra before, right?

298
00:14:02,900 --> 00:14:05,240
—Look.
—Huh?

299
00:14:05,470 --> 00:14:06,710
I'm getting kinda horny.

300
00:14:06,780 --> 00:14:08,840
—Painting your face again?
—There he goes again.

301
00:14:08,910 --> 00:14:11,780
You're doing the same thing from earlier?

302
00:14:12,580 --> 00:14:14,150
I made it a little thicker now.

303
00:14:14,220 --> 00:14:16,180
It's even harder to tell now.

304
00:14:16,250 --> 00:14:18,620
This guy's a complete idiot, for real.

305
00:14:18,690 --> 00:14:19,690
Why are you turning it off?

306
00:14:19,750 --> 00:14:21,220
—Huh?!
—The kiss thing.

307
00:14:21,290 --> 00:14:22,390
—Come on, that's enough.
—Do it again!

308
00:14:22,620 --> 00:14:24,260
You should leave it on all the time.

309
00:14:24,330 --> 00:14:26,160
Hey, can someone help me out practicing?

310
00:14:26,230 --> 00:14:28,160
—No, I'm fine.
—I'm fine, yeah.

311
00:14:28,230 --> 00:14:29,760
I'm really sorry.

312
00:14:30,530 --> 00:14:32,070
—It's okay, it's okay.
—Leave it.

313
00:14:32,130 --> 00:14:34,700
—When it hurt earlier—
—Look at—

314
00:14:34,770 --> 00:14:36,540
Look at the time already.

315
00:14:36,740 --> 00:14:39,740
Right? So I just wanted you to help me out.

316
00:14:40,010 --> 00:14:41,810
I don't want to help you out.

317
00:14:42,310 --> 00:14:43,850
I'm good with electricity, so...

318
00:14:43,910 --> 00:14:45,950
—Can I do that?
—Yeah.

319
00:14:46,010 --> 00:14:48,750
But it's just that doing it like that is boring.

320
00:14:48,820 --> 00:14:50,350
Bring some hot tea over.

321
00:14:52,350 --> 00:14:54,920
And so it's going to spill if it doesn't work.

322
00:14:54,990 --> 00:14:56,060
What do you think?

323
00:14:56,630 --> 00:14:58,760
I'm pretty sure I've seen this before already, though.

324
00:14:58,830 --> 00:15:01,160
I think this is a pretty new gag.

325
00:15:01,230 --> 00:15:03,060
Tea... where do we have tea?

326
00:15:03,470 --> 00:15:05,470
Are we gonna do this?
What do you think?

327
00:15:05,530 --> 00:15:07,270
We also might have zombies showing up.

328
00:15:07,470 --> 00:15:08,540
Right?

329
00:15:09,600 --> 00:15:10,870
—What's going on?
—What's going on, yeah.

330
00:15:10,940 --> 00:15:12,710
Wait, what's going on? What's that?

331
00:15:12,770 --> 00:15:13,810
What's that?

332
00:15:14,040 --> 00:15:15,640
What are you putting in there?
Can I take a look?

333
00:15:15,710 --> 00:15:16,980
The viagra from earlier?

334
00:15:22,880 --> 00:15:24,120
No, actually, isn't that...

335
00:15:24,190 --> 00:15:26,350
a remote control vibrator?

336
00:15:26,590 --> 00:15:28,690
—It's my first time using one.
—Where's the control?

337
00:15:29,090 --> 00:15:30,360
It's right here, isn't it?

338
00:15:32,990 --> 00:15:34,730
Was that Shouji's reaction?

339
00:15:34,800 --> 00:15:37,370
Okay, so are we going to use the hot tea?

340
00:15:37,430 --> 00:15:38,730
With this on...

341
00:15:38,800 --> 00:15:41,400
Does that hurt? Can he stand it?

342
00:15:41,470 --> 00:15:43,170
We could add this on as well.

343
00:15:44,810 --> 00:15:46,240
It's no good, huh?

344
00:15:47,280 --> 00:15:49,210
—Bring some hot tea.
—What are you doing Shouji?

345
00:15:50,050 --> 00:15:51,750
—Are we doing this?
—Huh...

346
00:15:52,580 --> 00:15:53,750
What's wrong, Shouji?

347
00:15:54,180 --> 00:15:56,480
—Bro.
—Who you calling bro?

348
00:15:58,550 --> 00:16:00,060
What are you doing, Shouji?

349
00:16:01,620 --> 00:16:03,660
Come on, this is taking too long.

350
00:16:03,730 --> 00:16:05,790
What are we going to do?

351
00:16:05,860 --> 00:16:06,860
Isn't he going to drink it?

352
00:16:06,930 --> 00:16:08,500
We just need something hot.

353
00:16:08,730 --> 00:16:11,130
What about the ramen?
Wouldn't that work?

354
00:16:11,200 --> 00:16:12,200
It should work, yeah.

355
00:16:13,800 --> 00:16:14,900
Stop that already!

356
00:16:14,970 --> 00:16:16,470
—Bro!
—I'm not your "bro".

357
00:16:17,970 --> 00:16:19,610
—What about this?
—Whoa!

358
00:16:20,510 --> 00:16:23,710
We don't have any soup? Or water?

359
00:16:24,250 --> 00:16:25,350
Would hot water work?

360
00:16:25,410 --> 00:16:26,410
Sure, that should work.

361
00:16:26,480 --> 00:16:28,080
Really? So water or soup would work?

362
00:16:28,150 --> 00:16:29,780
—Yeah.
—Shouji...

363
00:16:29,850 --> 00:16:31,920
I'm giving you the water.

364
00:16:31,990 --> 00:16:33,690
That burns!

365
00:16:33,760 --> 00:16:35,890
Where? Why? It wasn't me, right?

366
00:16:35,960 --> 00:16:37,460
It hurts all over!

367
00:16:38,030 --> 00:16:40,230
That burns!!

368
00:16:40,560 --> 00:16:41,830
Hurry, "bro"!

369
00:16:41,900 --> 00:16:43,500
Cassius, does this work? (EN: 4)

370
00:16:43,970 --> 00:16:46,170
—Cassius?
—Isn't that Shinsuke-san?

371
00:16:46,230 --> 00:16:48,370
—No one remembers that anyways!
—Wasn't that the name Shinsuke-san used...

372
00:16:48,440 --> 00:16:49,540
when he produced music?

373
00:16:49,940 --> 00:16:52,370
—Shouji.
—Stop it, bro, for real!

374
00:16:52,440 --> 00:16:53,440
Shouji...

375
00:16:56,280 --> 00:16:58,980
Bro!

376
00:17:00,580 --> 00:17:01,580
"Bro"?

377
00:17:02,320 --> 00:17:03,490
Hurry up already!

378
00:17:03,550 --> 00:17:05,250
Cassius, can I give this to you?

379
00:17:07,090 --> 00:17:08,190
Come on man...

380
00:17:10,760 --> 00:17:12,390
Can you drop it with the "Cassius" thing?

381
00:17:12,890 --> 00:17:15,000
Isn't that in Hexagon's style, though?

382
00:17:15,060 --> 00:17:18,270
Since we're doing the whole "bro" gag,
we could go with "Cassius" as well.

383
00:17:18,600 --> 00:17:20,900
But I'm not even Cassius.

384
00:17:20,970 --> 00:17:24,740
That was just a name that Shinsuke-san used

385
00:17:24,810 --> 00:17:26,780
when he did music production.

386
00:17:26,840 --> 00:17:28,580
Like with Sata Andagi?

387
00:17:28,780 --> 00:17:31,010
Well, I guess so, yeah.

388
00:17:31,080 --> 00:17:32,150
Was he in Sata Andagi?

389
00:17:32,210 --> 00:17:33,450
He wasn't.

390
00:17:33,520 --> 00:17:35,020
—The Okinawa rail
—flew off!

391
00:17:35,080 --> 00:17:36,250
That's a Sata Andagi song, right?

392
00:17:36,320 --> 00:17:37,550
And he took to the gap between the clouds!

393
00:17:37,620 --> 00:17:38,620
You sure know that song, huh?

394
00:17:38,820 --> 00:17:40,390
Sengoku-san flew off!

395
00:17:41,760 --> 00:17:42,760
Right.

396
00:17:42,820 --> 00:17:44,660
Isn't he almost laughing by himself?

397
00:17:46,090 --> 00:17:47,200
Who the hell's Sengoku-san?

398
00:17:47,260 --> 00:17:50,060
A racer from the 8 hours endurance race.

399
00:17:50,330 --> 00:17:52,330
You remember Club Shinsuke?

400
00:17:52,770 --> 00:17:54,370
—Team Shinsuke!
—Damn it, there he goes!

401
00:17:55,500 --> 00:17:58,370
This is "high school girl"!

402
00:17:58,440 --> 00:18:01,080
Chan! Bara! Sho!

403
00:18:09,880 --> 00:18:13,760
My father's rival!

404
00:18:14,220 --> 00:18:18,190
My father's rival!

405
00:18:20,360 --> 00:18:21,400
—What the hell's going on?
—I don't get it.

406
00:18:21,460 --> 00:18:23,300
He's an entertainer...

407
00:18:26,300 --> 00:18:30,310
My mother's teachings!

408
00:18:30,510 --> 00:18:32,010
My mother's teachings!

409
00:18:32,010 --> 00:18:33,310
Great song, huh?
My mother's teachings!

410
00:18:33,310 --> 00:18:34,040
— My mother's teachings!

411
00:18:34,040 --> 00:18:34,610
— I think the song's great, actually.
— My mother's teachings!

412
00:18:34,610 --> 00:18:35,040
— I think the song's great, actually.

413
00:18:35,440 --> 00:18:36,680
There's basically no filler.

414
00:18:36,740 --> 00:18:38,710
This is where it gets good.

415
00:18:39,650 --> 00:18:41,250
Isn't he doing it twice?

416
00:18:42,720 --> 00:18:46,190
These are the village's rules.

417
00:18:46,420 --> 00:18:49,490
These are the village's rules.

418
00:18:49,560 --> 00:18:51,630
He's been doing it for a while, huh?
Is there even a punchline?

419
00:18:52,260 --> 00:18:53,560
Where, though?

420
00:18:57,970 --> 00:19:01,340
In a remote region!

421
00:19:01,940 --> 00:19:02,970
In a remote region!
That's pretty bad.

422
00:19:02,970 --> 00:19:04,740
In a remote region!

423
00:19:04,840 --> 00:19:07,240
—A remote region?
—A remote region, really?

424
00:19:07,310 --> 00:19:08,340
Thank you very much.

425
00:19:08,410 --> 00:19:09,810
Huh?

426
00:19:10,510 --> 00:19:11,680
A solo act?

427
00:19:12,010 --> 00:19:14,050
—What's going on?
—That was a great song.

428
00:19:14,120 --> 00:19:16,250
— Huh?
— A high school girl?

429
00:19:16,320 --> 00:19:17,990
No, I'm just here as a demonstration.

430
00:19:18,190 --> 00:19:19,850
—A demonstration?
—You mean an audition?

431
00:19:19,920 --> 00:19:21,060
The audition's not today?

432
00:19:21,120 --> 00:19:22,890
—It's not.
—Really?

433
00:19:23,560 --> 00:19:25,190
We're not doing any auditions here.

434
00:19:25,260 --> 00:19:26,760
—Really?
—You're wrong.

435
00:19:26,830 --> 00:19:28,830
This isn't "Close Up Gendai" from the NHK? (EN: 5)

436
00:19:29,630 --> 00:19:31,570
—There was no punchline after all.
—"Close Up Gendai"?

437
00:19:31,630 --> 00:19:32,630
They don't even do gags there.

438
00:19:32,700 --> 00:19:34,440
—None at all.
—That's not a comedy show.

439
00:19:34,670 --> 00:19:36,910
They told me to prepare a revenge gag.

440
00:19:36,970 --> 00:19:39,310
—What are you talking about?
—You're wrong, though.

441
00:19:39,940 --> 00:19:41,980
But "Close Up Gendai" isn't really...

442
00:19:42,040 --> 00:19:43,610
they're more social focused so...

443
00:19:43,680 --> 00:19:44,680
Right.

444
00:19:46,380 --> 00:19:48,720
Wait— wait...

445
00:19:49,980 --> 00:19:51,920
He's gonna cut him! Watch out!
Watch out with the neck!

446
00:19:51,990 --> 00:19:53,520
—What are you doing?!
—Watch out with the neck!

447
00:19:59,460 --> 00:20:00,930
—Ah!
—That burns!

448
00:20:01,000 --> 00:20:02,000
Stop it with the neck.

449
00:20:02,060 --> 00:20:03,160
—Where?
—The neck?

450
00:20:03,230 --> 00:20:04,530
My neck...

451
00:20:04,600 --> 00:20:05,800
And he goes and asks anyway.

452
00:20:06,300 --> 00:20:10,070
Ouch! That burns! My neck!

453
00:20:10,140 --> 00:20:11,140
She's not stopping so...

454
00:20:11,210 --> 00:20:12,640
Tell her to stop!

455
00:20:12,910 --> 00:20:15,410
—Then you have to—
—That hurts!!

456
00:20:15,980 --> 00:20:17,080
The sword hurts?

457
00:20:17,150 --> 00:20:18,210
The sword, yeah.

458
00:20:20,050 --> 00:20:21,080
I'll do it with the back, then.

459
00:20:21,150 --> 00:20:23,050
The back!

460
00:20:24,890 --> 00:20:26,750
The back's hot!

461
00:20:28,420 --> 00:20:30,660
That burns? Right?

462
00:20:30,730 --> 00:20:31,990
The back of her sword's incredible.

463
00:20:32,060 --> 00:20:33,560
The back of her sword's incredible!

464
00:20:33,630 --> 00:20:35,300
The back...

465
00:20:35,360 --> 00:20:37,330
Ouch!

466
00:20:39,630 --> 00:20:43,000
I can't take it.
What's going on?

467
00:20:43,070 --> 00:20:45,840
Want us to call Matsumoto-san?
You wanna get a red?

468
00:20:45,910 --> 00:20:48,240
No, no, not a red.

469
00:20:48,540 --> 00:20:50,310
—Want to retire on your own?
—I'm not doing that.

470
00:20:50,380 --> 00:20:52,380
Wait a second. The pizza will be here soon.

471
00:20:52,450 --> 00:20:53,950
—At least until the pizza's here.
—Until it's here, yeah.

472
00:20:55,650 --> 00:20:59,220
You think I could do a little something?

473
00:20:59,290 --> 00:21:00,360
—Huh?
—Okay, Oshiro-san.

474
00:21:00,420 --> 00:21:02,590
This one got me banned from eldercare.

475
00:21:02,660 --> 00:21:04,660
—Whoa!
—It got you banned?

476
00:21:04,730 --> 00:21:07,830
Yeah. Here I go.

477
00:21:08,960 --> 00:21:09,960
Here I go.

478
00:21:12,630 --> 00:21:18,370
I love grandpa's smile!

479
00:21:19,310 --> 00:21:24,380
I love grandma's smile!

480
00:21:24,950 --> 00:21:31,420
What's Earth, aliens or God?

481
00:21:33,250 --> 00:21:34,420
Burns!

482
00:21:38,730 --> 00:21:40,730
Are you okay? Watch out!

483
00:21:40,800 --> 00:21:42,730
— I love grandpa's smile!

484
00:21:42,730 --> 00:21:43,770
— No, no...
— I love grandpa's smile!

485
00:21:43,770 --> 00:21:44,900
— I love grandpa's smile!

486
00:21:44,900 --> 00:21:46,800
— Are you okay, Oshiro?
— I love grandpa's smile!

487
00:21:46,800 --> 00:21:47,040
— Are you okay, Oshiro?

488
00:21:47,240 --> 00:21:47,900
— Watch out, watch out!

489
00:21:47,900 --> 00:21:48,900
— Grandma's smile...
— Watch out, watch out!

490
00:21:48,900 --> 00:21:50,440
Grandma's smile...

491
00:21:50,510 --> 00:21:51,910
Wait, wait!

492
00:21:51,970 --> 00:21:52,610
— God, aliens and Earth...

493
00:21:52,610 --> 00:21:54,340
— No, no, wait Oshiro!
— God, aliens and Earth...

494
00:21:54,340 --> 00:21:56,940
God, aliens and Earth...

495
00:21:57,010 --> 00:21:58,010
Are you alright?

496
00:21:58,250 --> 00:22:00,010
—No, no, no
—Ah!

497
00:22:04,490 --> 00:22:05,620
No...

498
00:22:07,120 --> 00:22:09,220
What happened? Are you okay?

499
00:22:09,520 --> 00:22:09,890
— I love grandpa's smile!

500
00:22:09,890 --> 00:22:10,890
— Come on...
— I love grandpa's smile!

501
00:22:10,890 --> 00:22:10,960
— I love grandpa's smile!

502
00:22:10,960 --> 00:22:12,790
—That's enough!
—Is this the last one?
— I love grandpa's smile!

503
00:22:12,790 --> 00:22:15,230
I love grandma's smile!

504
00:22:16,100 --> 00:22:18,070
Grandma's smile...

505
00:22:18,130 --> 00:22:19,470
What are you...?

506
00:22:21,040 --> 00:22:22,340
—Are you okay?
—No, no, no.

507
00:22:22,400 --> 00:22:23,870
Earth!

508
00:22:24,410 --> 00:22:26,240
No, for real. This is too much!

509
00:22:26,310 --> 00:22:29,010
Scary! Scary! Scary!

510
00:22:30,710 --> 00:22:35,250
What is God? Grandpa? Grandma?

511
00:22:40,390 --> 00:22:41,860
Come on, man, no way!

512
00:22:43,120 --> 00:22:46,930
That burns! Too hot!

513
00:22:46,990 --> 00:22:49,960
—This guy's a complete idiot!
—I brought some medicine.
Can I drink it?

514
00:22:50,030 --> 00:22:51,070
You're drinking it?

515
00:23:01,610 --> 00:23:02,940
That was a tough act.

516
00:23:03,010 --> 00:23:04,010
—A tough act.
—What's he doing?

517
00:23:04,080 --> 00:23:05,450
You did this in eldercare?

518
00:23:05,510 --> 00:23:07,150
—I think that's too...
—Of course you'd get banned.

519
00:23:07,920 --> 00:23:09,420
He's looking all pale.

520
00:23:14,160 --> 00:23:15,320
This is quite the picture.

521
00:23:17,690 --> 00:23:18,690
What's going on?

522
00:23:21,960 --> 00:23:23,200
It didn't work out.

523
00:23:23,260 --> 00:23:24,300
It didn't?

524
00:23:24,370 --> 00:23:27,170
It had to come out more like...

525
00:23:27,240 --> 00:23:28,870
Like expanding?

526
00:23:28,940 --> 00:23:30,840
Like bursting out of your mouth?
Like pouring?

527
00:23:32,640 --> 00:23:34,110
I guess the powder was too old.

528
00:23:37,040 --> 00:23:38,810
—Sorry for the wait!
—The pizza's here!

529
00:23:39,610 --> 00:23:41,620
—Fujita!
—The pizza's here!

530
00:23:42,250 --> 00:23:43,850
—Excuse me!
—Thank you very much!

531
00:23:43,920 --> 00:23:45,390
This way.
Would this way be okay?

532
00:23:45,450 --> 00:23:47,320
This way, yeah.
Can you leave it here?

533
00:23:47,390 --> 00:23:48,990
I'm leaving it here, then.

534
00:23:49,060 --> 00:23:50,860
First the Yuzuinari Orizome, right?

535
00:23:50,930 --> 00:23:52,890
—The inari.
—This isn't an ashtray okay?

536
00:23:52,960 --> 00:23:54,260
Oh, the sushi!

537
00:23:54,330 --> 00:23:56,160
This is the nagoya dish for three.

538
00:23:56,230 --> 00:23:58,870
That's what Cookie requested.

539
00:23:58,930 --> 00:23:59,930
—Right.
—Thank you very much.

540
00:24:00,000 --> 00:24:01,300
Well then, I'll take my leave.

541
00:24:01,370 --> 00:24:02,500
That looks good!

542
00:24:07,980 --> 00:24:08,980
Right now?

543
00:24:12,510 --> 00:24:13,510
Now?

544
00:24:14,680 --> 00:24:17,350
—Was that it?
—That's it, but...

545
00:24:17,420 --> 00:24:19,320
It's not that amazing even when it works.

546
00:24:19,390 --> 00:24:20,990
Ah, I see.

547
00:24:23,590 --> 00:24:25,060
Wanna play a game again?

548
00:24:25,130 --> 00:24:26,430
—I do.
—A game, right?

549
00:24:26,660 --> 00:24:30,130
Okay, Koumoto and Shouji, sit down.

550
00:24:30,200 --> 00:24:31,570
—Sitting down?
—Yeah.

551
00:24:31,630 --> 00:24:33,970
Fujimoto, I'm done with the painful games!

552
00:24:34,040 --> 00:24:36,400
No, no, no!
You two guys do it!

553
00:24:36,740 --> 00:24:39,370
You put this in your mouth,

554
00:24:39,640 --> 00:24:42,310
and one of you goes like this.

555
00:24:42,380 --> 00:24:45,280
So with this in your mouth, you have to strike like...

556
00:24:45,350 --> 00:24:48,020
And if you do it right,

557
00:24:48,080 --> 00:24:50,080
you have to truly slam his head.

558
00:24:50,150 --> 00:24:51,250
Making a sound?

559
00:24:51,320 --> 00:24:52,620
More than a sound, it has to look painful.

560
00:24:52,690 --> 00:24:53,750
If you wanna do it right, you really have to...

561
00:24:53,820 --> 00:24:55,890
get the proper timing.

562
00:24:55,960 --> 00:24:57,930
I see. Can I take a swing?

563
00:24:57,990 --> 00:24:59,930
—You can, yeah.
—So I have to go like this?

564
00:24:59,990 --> 00:25:01,560
Right! You can't use your hands.

565
00:25:01,630 --> 00:25:05,270
Okay, first attack, Koumoto.

566
00:25:05,830 --> 00:25:08,470
Let's go, Koumoto! Go ahead!

567
00:25:11,610 --> 00:25:12,610
That's no good, yeah.

568
00:25:12,670 --> 00:25:14,540
You have to go more like...

569
00:25:14,610 --> 00:25:15,940
Yeah, more energy.

570
00:25:16,010 --> 00:25:18,650
—Okay, change, change.
—Oh, this is bad.

571
00:25:18,880 --> 00:25:20,720
—Okay, move your head.
—I don't really understand...

572
00:25:20,780 --> 00:25:23,020
I don't really understand what I have to do.

573
00:25:23,080 --> 00:25:25,990
Okay, let's go. One, two...

574
00:25:26,420 --> 00:25:28,590
—Ouch!
—Whoa!

575
00:25:29,660 --> 00:25:32,190
—Whoa!
—He's really strong!

576
00:25:34,330 --> 00:25:36,730
—He's good!
—Shouji-san is pretty strong!

577
00:25:37,130 --> 00:25:38,930
—He's good!
—He is.

578
00:25:39,670 --> 00:25:41,300
What's wrong? You okay?

579
00:25:41,670 --> 00:25:42,770
It's just that...

580
00:25:44,510 --> 00:25:46,240
I think I have to pay a visit to my dentist...

581
00:25:47,580 --> 00:25:51,580
All of my teeth feel like they're gonna fall off.

582
00:25:51,650 --> 00:25:53,550
I thought they had fallen off.

583
00:25:53,980 --> 00:25:56,420
—Huh?
—They're there, they're there.

584
00:25:56,480 --> 00:25:58,420
You still have all of them.

585
00:25:58,720 --> 00:26:00,020
Okay, ready?
So come on...

586
00:26:00,090 --> 00:26:04,360
You really have to let it down with force, okay?

587
00:26:04,990 --> 00:26:07,030
Here I go. Let's go.
On the count of three.

588
00:26:08,200 --> 00:26:09,230
One, two...!

589
00:26:10,900 --> 00:26:12,570
—A little more!
—What was that?

590
00:26:12,630 --> 00:26:14,940
You go easy on him when you hit him!

591
00:26:15,000 --> 00:26:17,810
You have to give it a little more!

592
00:26:17,870 --> 00:26:18,870
It's like you stop, like...

593
00:26:18,940 --> 00:26:20,910
This isn't working,
it's not working.

594
00:26:20,980 --> 00:26:22,240
So like...

595
00:26:22,310 --> 00:26:24,080
you have to raise it and lower it swiftly!

596
00:26:24,450 --> 00:26:25,810
Okay, switch!

597
00:26:26,010 --> 00:26:28,420
Fine, but are you really doing it Shouji?

598
00:26:28,650 --> 00:26:29,650
He is.

599
00:26:29,880 --> 00:26:31,120
—Ready?
—Yeah.

600
00:26:31,550 --> 00:26:32,650
One, two...!

601
00:26:49,170 --> 00:26:52,040
How do you do it?
Take a strike right now!

602
00:26:53,540 --> 00:26:54,640
—Ready?
—Yeah.

603
00:26:54,710 --> 00:26:58,710
You have to go like this and lower it.

604
00:26:59,680 --> 00:27:03,650
So when you go,
when you go like this...

605
00:27:03,720 --> 00:27:05,290
Man, this part of your neck
just screws up all over.

606
00:27:05,350 --> 00:27:07,390
Right here.

607
00:27:08,160 --> 00:27:12,990
It goes like this...
around your neck, around here.

608
00:27:13,060 --> 00:27:14,830
So I don't do...

609
00:27:16,100 --> 00:27:18,770
You're really getting hurt today, huh?

610
00:27:21,570 --> 00:27:23,840
Okay, wanna do it one more time?
Are you doing it?

611
00:27:25,870 --> 00:27:27,880
—Right!
—That's how you do it!

612
00:27:27,940 --> 00:27:29,140
Right, Fujimoto-san?

613
00:27:29,210 --> 00:27:31,680
Yeah. Let's go on the count of three.

614
00:27:32,010 --> 00:27:33,010
Here.

615
00:27:33,510 --> 00:27:34,520
Here we go.

616
00:27:36,320 --> 00:27:37,820
One, two...

617
00:27:49,000 --> 00:27:51,270
What happened?

618
00:27:51,330 --> 00:27:52,700
Are you hurt?

619
00:27:53,330 --> 00:27:56,200
It hurts? You okay?

620
00:27:58,310 --> 00:28:00,780
It's because this is a stick,

621
00:28:00,840 --> 00:28:04,550
I'm sure he's not going like this,
but like this for sure!

622
00:28:08,380 --> 00:28:10,320
—That hurts!
—Ready?

623
00:28:10,850 --> 00:28:14,390
Ready? You sure?
Let's go!

624
00:28:14,460 --> 00:28:18,090
—Ouch!
—Here we go! One, two...

625
00:28:18,160 --> 00:28:19,660
Ouch!

626
00:28:25,970 --> 00:28:27,070
Ouch...

627
00:28:32,370 --> 00:28:34,810
Come on, drop it already...

628
00:28:38,980 --> 00:28:40,580
Please.

629
00:28:46,620 --> 00:28:47,620
Sorry.

630
00:28:48,160 --> 00:28:49,660
—Let's stop that.
—Sorry.

631
00:28:50,090 --> 00:28:54,530
I'm feeling dizzy.

632
00:28:57,830 --> 00:29:00,500
I always thought that...

633
00:29:01,640 --> 00:29:05,240
that you were hiding things from me.

634
00:29:06,270 --> 00:29:08,980
You're always making a fool out of me.

635
00:29:10,210 --> 00:29:12,210
And you make our guests laugh.

636
00:29:12,280 --> 00:29:14,180
I know that you're hiding it behind your back.

637
00:29:14,250 --> 00:29:16,620
And then you hit me with it.

638
00:29:17,080 --> 00:29:18,090
Sorry.

639
00:29:18,490 --> 00:29:23,320
Let me get back at you at least once.

640
00:29:26,290 --> 00:29:29,000
At least tell me why you were hitting me.
Tell me.

641
00:29:29,060 --> 00:29:30,930
This is a trauma that affects me every night.

642
00:29:31,000 --> 00:29:32,970
Why did he hit me?

643
00:29:33,400 --> 00:29:35,940
In my nightmares...

644
00:29:36,000 --> 00:29:38,270
Have you ever woken up to a sound like this?

645
00:29:39,840 --> 00:29:41,780
To this sound?

646
00:29:41,840 --> 00:29:44,350
Have you ever woken up in a cold sweat to this sound?

647
00:29:44,410 --> 00:29:46,380
—Never.
—Right?

648
00:29:46,450 --> 00:29:47,750
—Never.
—Figures.

649
00:29:47,820 --> 00:29:49,280
Let me do it once.

650
00:29:49,350 --> 00:29:50,580
At least just once.

651
00:29:50,650 --> 00:29:52,990
I know you were doing just that.

652
00:29:53,620 --> 00:29:56,090
—I guess that could—
— Huh?

653
00:29:56,490 --> 00:29:58,130
—That's Onita.
—Onita. (EN: 6)

654
00:29:58,190 --> 00:29:59,260
Onita?

655
00:30:06,070 --> 00:30:09,170
What's wrong? What do you want?!

656
00:30:11,870 --> 00:30:13,210
What is it?!

657
00:30:13,970 --> 00:30:15,280
No, it's just that...

658
00:30:16,010 --> 00:30:19,250
We were playing a game, you know so...

659
00:30:19,710 --> 00:30:21,080
You were getting pretty warmed up.

660
00:30:21,150 --> 00:30:22,280
We were.

661
00:30:22,350 --> 00:30:23,850
—Sorry.
—What's going on?!

662
00:30:24,050 --> 00:30:25,590
It's just that we were playing a game so...

663
00:30:25,650 --> 00:30:26,990
So if you're going to complain well...

664
00:30:27,050 --> 00:30:28,290
Just let us know.

665
00:30:28,360 --> 00:30:29,590
Are you Onita?

666
00:30:29,660 --> 00:30:30,820
I am...!!

667
00:30:30,890 --> 00:30:33,060
— Ah, Onita.
— Onita-san, right?

668
00:30:33,130 --> 00:30:35,330
Hirose Alice!!

669
00:30:35,560 --> 00:30:36,730
No you're not.

670
00:30:39,430 --> 00:30:43,040
Got that? Hirose Alice and...

671
00:30:44,100 --> 00:30:47,940
Hirose Suzu are family!! (EN: 7)

672
00:30:48,610 --> 00:30:50,440
Well, yeah, they are.

673
00:30:51,010 --> 00:30:52,650
Sit down, Manabe.

674
00:30:52,710 --> 00:30:54,620
—Manabe?
—From TV Asahi?

675
00:30:55,480 --> 00:30:56,520
Manabe...

676
00:30:58,020 --> 00:31:01,520
Well... wait a seocnd.
I'm not even Manabe.

677
00:31:01,590 --> 00:31:03,420
Got anything to say?

678
00:31:04,790 --> 00:31:06,060
Speak up.

679
00:31:06,660 --> 00:31:07,660
You should wait.

680
00:31:07,900 --> 00:31:08,900
No, well...

681
00:31:10,130 --> 00:31:12,470
I was just wondering why you're here.

682
00:31:12,530 --> 00:31:14,370
Are you sure you're in the right place?

683
00:31:17,740 --> 00:31:20,170
This is Alice's lifestyle.

684
00:31:21,410 --> 00:31:22,740
— Alice?
— You're Onita, though?

685
00:31:22,980 --> 00:31:24,610
Are you sure you're not Onita-san?

686
00:31:25,350 --> 00:31:28,380
Onita...
You're supposed to be Onita-san, right?

687
00:31:30,250 --> 00:31:33,720
You got the gender wrong...
But you're Onita-san, right?

688
00:31:33,790 --> 00:31:35,090
You think...

689
00:31:36,360 --> 00:31:38,290
I have a cock?

690
00:31:44,600 --> 00:31:45,970
I think you do.

691
00:31:47,670 --> 00:31:49,670
You're dead wrong!!

692
00:31:49,740 --> 00:31:51,570
So you do?

693
00:31:51,640 --> 00:31:53,010
I do.

694
00:31:53,670 --> 00:31:54,780
Just a little.

695
00:31:54,840 --> 00:31:56,480
So you're a guy, right?

696
00:31:56,540 --> 00:31:57,610
You're not Alice.

697
00:31:57,680 --> 00:31:58,950
I'm Alice.

698
00:32:00,210 --> 00:32:02,150
So what was it you wanted to say?

699
00:32:06,190 --> 00:32:09,060
Well... they had been hitting me for a while...

700
00:32:09,120 --> 00:32:11,830
so I wanted to get back at them.

701
00:32:11,890 --> 00:32:13,260
But I may be able to do it with Onita-san.

702
00:32:13,330 --> 00:32:15,800
—He's got nothing to do with it!
—I was watching you from the back.

703
00:32:16,530 --> 00:32:17,670
But you know?!

704
00:32:20,130 --> 00:32:24,610
I, Hirose Alice, cannot do anything

705
00:32:24,670 --> 00:32:26,010
against you people's injustice!

706
00:32:29,480 --> 00:32:30,680
He can't do anything?

707
00:32:30,740 --> 00:32:33,350
Please do something, please.

708
00:32:33,710 --> 00:32:36,320
I'm an actress!!

709
00:32:43,460 --> 00:32:45,030
Let me do it at least once.

710
00:32:45,090 --> 00:32:46,690
Tell me everything you want to say.

711
00:32:46,760 --> 00:32:48,600
He told you earlier.

712
00:32:48,830 --> 00:32:50,760
Yeah, I did.
I was being hit by this guy...

713
00:32:50,830 --> 00:32:53,630
...all this time. So I want Onita-san to...

714
00:32:53,970 --> 00:32:57,100
You were saying you wanted to get back at them, right?

715
00:32:57,170 --> 00:32:58,170
Exactly.

716
00:32:58,240 --> 00:32:59,470
—You want to hit them back?
—I want to do that.

717
00:32:59,540 --> 00:33:01,280
To get back at them for hitting you?

718
00:33:01,340 --> 00:33:03,240
I want to hit them for hitting me.

719
00:33:03,310 --> 00:33:04,750
But you know I'm an actress, right?!

720
00:33:04,810 --> 00:33:05,810
I can't do anything!!

721
00:33:05,880 --> 00:33:07,150
Then why did you ask?

722
00:33:08,080 --> 00:33:11,390
Why did he tell him?

723
00:33:11,450 --> 00:33:14,250
—Why's he here?
—You wanna tell the actress?

724
00:33:14,320 --> 00:33:16,390
Someone weird showed up again.

725
00:33:19,060 --> 00:33:20,890
— Suzu!
— Huh?

726
00:33:21,460 --> 00:33:23,530
— Hirose Suzu-san?
— Hey, Suzu.

727
00:33:23,600 --> 00:33:25,370
That's... isn't that Don Frye? (EN: 8)

728
00:33:25,430 --> 00:33:26,500
—Don Frye?
—That's Suzu.

729
00:33:26,570 --> 00:33:27,570
No, that's Don Frye!

730
00:33:28,240 --> 00:33:29,270
Suzu!

731
00:33:30,170 --> 00:33:32,210
—Don Frye?
—Tell me what you want to say!

732
00:33:33,170 --> 00:33:34,710
Just who's... Don Frye?

733
00:33:34,780 --> 00:33:35,980
I'm Suzu.

734
00:33:36,380 --> 00:33:38,110
— Suzu-san?
—How are you Suzu?

735
00:33:38,510 --> 00:33:39,650
I'm Don Suzu.

736
00:33:39,710 --> 00:33:42,050
— Don Suzu?
— Not Hirose Suzu?

737
00:33:42,220 --> 00:33:45,520
This guy's... an actress!!

738
00:33:46,350 --> 00:33:47,720
Nice to meet you.

739
00:33:48,290 --> 00:33:50,260
—That's not an actress.
—Not an actress at all.

740
00:33:50,320 --> 00:33:51,530
You're not even a woman.

741
00:33:51,790 --> 00:33:53,560
—An actress, huh?
—Hey!

742
00:33:53,960 --> 00:33:56,330
Wanna try something, sis?

743
00:33:56,600 --> 00:34:00,400
Listen, we're doing the Suzu gag now.

744
00:34:01,370 --> 00:34:02,970
Hey, just sit down.

745
00:34:07,910 --> 00:34:09,040
There?

746
00:34:11,250 --> 00:34:12,450
Everyone, make sure you can see.

747
00:34:15,700 --> 00:34:19,760
"Whoa! I'm falling!!"

748
00:34:23,190 --> 00:34:24,700
So he's not going to read them?

749
00:34:24,700 --> 00:34:24,760
"Yay! Saved by Hiro's nape from Yasuda Dai Circus!"
So he's not going to read them?

750
00:34:24,760 --> 00:34:25,030
"Yay! Saved by Hiro's nape from Yasuda Dai Circus!"

751
00:34:25,030 --> 00:34:27,090
So he's reading this part?
"Yay! Saved by Hiro's nape from Yasuda Dai Circus!"

752
00:34:28,700 --> 00:34:30,460
He's reading, listen!!

753
00:34:31,570 --> 00:34:32,930
He's not saying anything.

754
00:34:34,840 --> 00:34:37,240
—So she fell on Hiro, right?
—As a surface.

755
00:34:38,410 --> 00:34:41,040
Oh, she's Hiro's lover!

756
00:34:42,780 --> 00:34:43,780
It's stretching.

757
00:34:48,650 --> 00:34:49,650
What's going on?

758
00:34:51,150 --> 00:34:53,720
So it's pulling on it?

759
00:34:53,790 --> 00:34:54,860
Is that a puppet?

760
00:34:55,120 --> 00:34:56,290
It's a silhouette.

761
00:34:56,360 --> 00:34:58,990
A silhouette? It's getting closer!

762
00:34:59,260 --> 00:35:00,560
There it is, there it is!!

763
00:35:01,030 --> 00:35:04,570
Is that Hiro?

764
00:35:05,830 --> 00:35:07,900
Of course it's Hiro. It has to be.

765
00:35:08,470 --> 00:35:10,700
It's Hiro.

766
00:35:10,770 --> 00:35:11,940
Hiro...

767
00:35:12,610 --> 00:35:13,610
That's Hiro.

768
00:35:15,240 --> 00:35:17,680
So now Hiro's eating?

769
00:35:17,740 --> 00:35:19,550
No, he became a table, right?

770
00:35:20,080 --> 00:35:22,150
— I don't get it.
— I don't get what's going on.

771
00:35:22,220 --> 00:35:23,750
This angle is too confusing.

772
00:35:23,920 --> 00:35:25,290
I think he might be a table.

773
00:35:27,350 --> 00:35:28,690
So it was Hiro.

774
00:35:28,760 --> 00:35:29,760
What's going on?

775
00:35:29,820 --> 00:35:31,260
Hiro... having dinner.

776
00:35:33,490 --> 00:35:34,630
Yeah, he is.

777
00:35:35,030 --> 00:35:36,560
That's curry?

778
00:35:41,500 --> 00:35:44,840
Ah, spilled the water.

779
00:35:44,910 --> 00:35:46,010
He spilled the water!

780
00:35:47,610 --> 00:35:50,140
— Whoa! That's scary!
— Ah! The eyes!

781
00:35:50,210 --> 00:35:51,580
That's scary, man.

782
00:35:51,650 --> 00:35:52,650
The end.

783
00:35:52,710 --> 00:35:53,710
Huh?!

784
00:35:56,080 --> 00:35:57,250
Thank you very much.

785
00:35:57,320 --> 00:36:00,920
The end!!

786
00:36:00,990 --> 00:36:02,960
Tell me what you thought one by one.

787
00:36:04,630 --> 00:36:05,760
This is hell.

788
00:36:06,690 --> 00:36:08,400
Tell me what you thought of my sister!

789
00:36:08,600 --> 00:36:09,960
—No, well...
—Speak!!

790
00:36:10,500 --> 00:36:15,740
That original punchline really reached my heart.

791
00:36:16,300 --> 00:36:17,670
What an... awful opinion.

792
00:36:18,070 --> 00:36:20,040
—Ouch.
—Come on!!

793
00:36:21,210 --> 00:36:24,240
I didn't really get it at the end.

794
00:36:25,010 --> 00:36:26,580
—What an awful opinion.
—Ouch!

795
00:36:26,650 --> 00:36:27,980
Stop it already!

796
00:36:28,050 --> 00:36:29,480
I'm freaking out here.

797
00:36:29,880 --> 00:36:31,890
I didn't really understand the end...

798
00:36:31,950 --> 00:36:34,090
Hiro-kun crying felt...

799
00:36:34,560 --> 00:36:37,020
profound, just like his link with the water.

800
00:36:37,090 --> 00:36:38,890
It truly got to me.

801
00:36:39,560 --> 00:36:40,690
More of that.

802
00:36:41,260 --> 00:36:44,500
Those tears could bring happiness to people,

803
00:36:44,570 --> 00:36:46,600
and the end was wonderful.

804
00:36:46,670 --> 00:36:48,100
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

805
00:36:48,170 --> 00:36:49,940
I almost felt like crying.

806
00:36:50,000 --> 00:36:52,540
Give me more, give me more.
I want to hear your opinion more.

807
00:36:52,970 --> 00:36:54,440
Why?

808
00:36:54,510 --> 00:37:00,310
You can tell that Hiro-kun's kindness
would reach the children,

809
00:37:00,380 --> 00:37:02,520
and I think that very kindness means the world.

810
00:37:02,580 --> 00:37:03,750
An awful opinion.

811
00:37:06,620 --> 00:37:08,990
Well, if I say anything bad about it,

812
00:37:09,060 --> 00:37:10,260
you're going to hit me with the mic, right?

813
00:37:10,620 --> 00:37:11,860
Fujimon...

814
00:37:11,930 --> 00:37:13,430
I think you should just give your honest thoughts.

815
00:37:13,860 --> 00:37:17,200
Well, to be honest, I want to see the sequel.

816
00:37:17,260 --> 00:37:18,500
That might work!

817
00:37:20,200 --> 00:37:21,500
— I want more...
— Like...

818
00:37:22,270 --> 00:37:26,270
Um... I've been wondering what might come next.

819
00:37:31,350 --> 00:37:32,480
Tell me more.

820
00:37:32,550 --> 00:37:35,880
I kind of got really excited at the end.

821
00:37:35,950 --> 00:37:38,520
She's my sister, she's my sister.

822
00:37:38,590 --> 00:37:40,490
I want you to have this.

823
00:37:40,550 --> 00:37:42,020
This is my sister.

824
00:37:42,090 --> 00:37:44,090
He's gonna give it to him?

825
00:37:44,160 --> 00:37:45,460
—Giving it out?
—That manuscript?

826
00:37:45,530 --> 00:37:47,360
Yay! I got the manuscript!

827
00:37:48,360 --> 00:37:49,600
—An awful opinion.
—Ouch!

828
00:37:53,930 --> 00:37:54,940
An awful opinion?

829
00:37:55,000 --> 00:37:57,740
Why was that an awful opinion?
I was complimenting you.

830
00:37:59,740 --> 00:38:01,110
I knew it.

831
00:38:01,680 --> 00:38:03,680
I don't get it at all...

832
00:38:07,650 --> 00:38:10,580
Wanna see something?

833
00:38:11,020 --> 00:38:12,420
Go ahead.

834
00:38:39,250 --> 00:38:40,510
Ah, the hat!

835
00:38:40,580 --> 00:38:43,620
He's pretty close!

836
00:38:43,680 --> 00:38:44,250
Pick up that hat.

837
00:38:48,290 --> 00:38:50,020
I wasn't expecting that.

838
00:38:54,060 --> 00:38:55,500
Please continue.

839
00:38:59,270 --> 00:39:01,200
That's a catchy tune.

840
00:39:01,270 --> 00:39:04,840
I took off his collar,

841
00:39:04,910 --> 00:39:08,410
so my dog ran away.

842
00:39:09,710 --> 00:39:13,150
He got run over...

843
00:39:13,580 --> 00:39:16,680
my one and only friend.

844
00:39:16,750 --> 00:39:18,150
— Whoa!
— Huh?!

845
00:39:18,350 --> 00:39:21,790
It stopped

846
00:39:22,020 --> 00:39:25,760
The Mira Parco (EN: 9)

847
00:39:26,530 --> 00:39:29,760
So I went to get revenge

848
00:39:30,130 --> 00:39:35,440
with my brass knuckles.

849
00:39:36,600 --> 00:39:40,540
I picked up a cigarette butt and ate it.

850
00:39:40,610 --> 00:39:43,910
Opened the car door,

851
00:39:44,280 --> 00:39:47,710
and there was a woman trembling,

852
00:39:47,910 --> 00:39:51,690
because she rammed into my dog.

853
00:39:51,750 --> 00:39:52,820
Huh?

854
00:39:55,360 --> 00:39:58,460
Love, love.

855
00:39:58,690 --> 00:40:02,500
It was love at first sight!

856
00:40:02,800 --> 00:40:05,900
— Love, love!
— This guy's an idiot.

857
00:40:05,970 --> 00:40:09,740
— I'm a Tokyo boy.
— A complete idiot.

858
00:40:09,800 --> 00:40:12,670
Love, love!

859
00:40:12,910 --> 00:40:16,710
My dog's name was cupid!

860
00:40:17,110 --> 00:40:19,780
Love, love

861
00:40:20,050 --> 00:40:23,720
You're a dog murderer

862
00:40:23,980 --> 00:40:26,650
I need you, I need you

863
00:40:27,090 --> 00:40:30,090
Bunnies die when they're lonely

864
00:40:30,160 --> 00:40:33,260
Woo-want you, want you

865
00:40:33,460 --> 00:40:36,900
I'm a Tokyo boy

866
00:40:36,960 --> 00:40:39,500
Love, love

867
00:40:39,800 --> 00:40:43,170
Okubo, Joban street

868
00:40:43,240 --> 00:40:47,240
The door's closing

869
00:40:47,310 --> 00:40:50,380
but I slip in

870
00:40:50,440 --> 00:40:54,410
before it does.

871
00:40:55,120 --> 00:40:57,720
It's wrong, it's wrong (Jp - Chigau n desu chigau n desu)

872
00:40:57,920 --> 00:41:00,390
It's wrong, it's wrong (Jp - Chigau n desu chigau n desu)

873
00:41:00,590 --> 00:41:03,090
I's wrng, I's wrng (Jp - Chiau su, Chiau su)

874
00:41:03,320 --> 00:41:05,930
Chance, Chance

875
00:41:06,160 --> 00:41:08,830
Chance, Chance,

876
00:41:09,030 --> 00:41:12,500
Chance's dog died.

877
00:41:12,570 --> 00:41:14,430
Thank you very much!

878
00:41:14,800 --> 00:41:15,800
Huh?

879
00:41:17,170 --> 00:41:18,470
You sure can sing.

880
00:41:21,270 --> 00:41:22,610
Don't do that in front of my store.

881
00:41:22,680 --> 00:41:25,080
Sorry, I'm just paying a visit.

882
00:41:25,150 --> 00:41:27,250
Don't get closer, I'll kill you.

883
00:41:28,980 --> 00:41:30,250
—Come on!
—Who's that...

884
00:41:30,320 --> 00:41:33,020
Who's that wench of a woman?

885
00:41:33,090 --> 00:41:34,220
You were listening?

886
00:41:34,290 --> 00:41:35,890
You're not listening!

887
00:41:35,960 --> 00:41:39,490
The other day, the other day,
you see, the other day, the other day,

888
00:41:39,860 --> 00:41:41,460
—the other day
—we can hear you.

889
00:41:41,530 --> 00:41:44,900
No, no, the other day,
you see... um...

890
00:41:44,970 --> 00:41:48,770
You... you know Hankyu Umeda? (EN: 10)

891
00:41:48,840 --> 00:41:50,040
—In Umeda, right?
—Hankyu Umeda...

892
00:41:50,100 --> 00:41:55,210
There's a station near... near... station...

893
00:41:55,280 --> 00:41:58,010
Near Hankyu U... U...

894
00:41:58,080 --> 00:42:00,250
—Hankyu Umeda, right?
—Ume... Umeda's

895
00:42:00,310 --> 00:42:02,650
—So what about it?
—Umeda's...

896
00:42:04,650 --> 00:42:06,320
St... Station.

897
00:42:06,390 --> 00:42:07,390
—What's going on?
—Are you okay?

898
00:42:07,450 --> 00:42:08,460
Wanna drink something?

899
00:42:08,520 --> 00:42:11,460
Umeda's station...

900
00:42:11,520 --> 00:42:13,560
Right, Umeda's station.

901
00:42:14,830 --> 00:42:18,430
I... I was... walking.

902
00:42:18,870 --> 00:42:20,800
That's the whole story?

903
00:42:20,870 --> 00:42:22,970
—Yeah.
—What a masterpiece.

904
00:42:23,170 --> 00:42:24,340
Are you insane?

905
00:42:24,700 --> 00:42:26,510
Who's questioning it?

906
00:42:26,570 --> 00:42:28,210
—Well it's just that...
—Why?

907
00:42:28,280 --> 00:42:30,140
—There's no punchline.
—You were just walking near Umeda's station.

908
00:42:30,210 --> 00:42:31,610
You were literally just walking.

909
00:42:31,680 --> 00:42:33,410
—Yesterday?
—Yesterday?

910
00:42:34,110 --> 00:42:35,280
I told you about it yesterday?

911
00:42:35,350 --> 00:42:36,350
No... uh... yesterday?

912
00:42:36,420 --> 00:42:41,990
See... yesterday, I... see...
There was this famous... famous...

913
00:42:42,060 --> 00:42:44,020
Who came.
That... Madoka-san, Madoka-san.

914
00:42:44,090 --> 00:42:45,090
Madoka Hiroshi-san. (EN: 11)

915
00:42:45,160 --> 00:42:47,230
So Madoka-san started talking...

916
00:42:47,290 --> 00:42:49,460
Madoka-san came back...
Madoka-san... came back.

917
00:42:49,530 --> 00:42:54,170
And opened the door, and I was at the door.

918
00:42:55,200 --> 00:42:57,170
The door... the door...

919
00:42:57,270 --> 00:42:59,510
Why are you getting stuck halfway there?

920
00:42:59,570 --> 00:43:02,640
So... the door... the door...

921
00:43:02,740 --> 00:43:03,910
—Right.
—It was—

922
00:43:05,680 --> 00:43:07,180
It was closed.

923
00:43:10,180 --> 00:43:12,220
—That's a masterpiece.
—What are you on about?

924
00:43:13,690 --> 00:43:15,090
—Madoka-san came and closed the door, that's all.

925
00:43:15,090 --> 00:43:16,300
—That's—
—Madoka-san came and closed the door, that's all.

926
00:43:16,300 --> 00:43:16,420
—That's—

927
00:43:16,490 --> 00:43:18,260
It's a pretty normal story, huh?

928
00:43:18,330 --> 00:43:20,990
Earlier...

929
00:43:21,530 --> 00:43:22,530
What happened earlier?

930
00:43:22,600 --> 00:43:25,430
Sh- Sh- Sh-

931
00:43:25,700 --> 00:43:26,730
—Sh?
—Sho...

932
00:43:26,800 --> 00:43:29,100
— Shoes?
— Shoes...

933
00:43:29,170 --> 00:43:30,440
What's up with shoes?

934
00:43:30,670 --> 00:43:35,740
Shoes... put them on...

935
00:43:37,080 --> 00:43:41,080
Well, putting on your shoes is normal...

936
00:43:41,510 --> 00:43:42,750
—Don't hold back
—You're holding back, so...

937
00:43:42,820 --> 00:43:44,780
Holding back?! Holding back?!
Don't talk like you're some kind of pro, kid!

938
00:43:45,020 --> 00:43:46,820
Putting on your shoes is a true masterpiece.

939
00:43:46,890 --> 00:43:48,920
What are you even talking about man?

940
00:43:48,990 --> 00:43:51,590
Of course not, since he's holding back,

941
00:43:51,660 --> 00:43:54,330
we're waiting far too long for a punchline.

942
00:43:54,390 --> 00:43:56,500
Don't critique like you're some kind of pro!

943
00:43:56,560 --> 00:43:57,560
What do you think about him?

944
00:43:57,630 --> 00:44:03,300
Ma- Ma- Ma-

945
00:44:03,940 --> 00:44:05,740
Man?

946
00:44:05,810 --> 00:44:09,010
Can't you tell?

947
00:44:11,040 --> 00:44:12,110
What do you think about him?

948
00:44:12,650 --> 00:44:13,950
Huh?!

949
00:44:14,310 --> 00:44:18,990
That's scary!

950
00:44:20,650 --> 00:44:21,790
He has a lot of eyes.

951
00:44:21,860 --> 00:44:23,120
He has some crazy eyes.

952
00:44:23,190 --> 00:44:24,390
That's freaky man!

953
00:44:24,460 --> 00:44:26,990
— Wow!
— Whoa!

954
00:44:27,460 --> 00:44:30,330
— Oh!
— Whoa, that's scary!

955
00:44:30,400 --> 00:44:31,970
A boy showed up...

956
00:44:32,200 --> 00:44:33,830
A boy...?

957
00:44:34,300 --> 00:44:36,300
No way!

958
00:44:38,240 --> 00:44:40,140
It's so freaky when it deflates...

959
00:44:41,840 --> 00:44:44,010
He can't breathe.

960
00:44:44,080 --> 00:44:45,480
Seems to be at his limit.

961
00:44:49,920 --> 00:44:51,520
That's some crazy breathing.

962
00:44:51,580 --> 00:44:53,390
How did he come up with this?

963
00:44:59,060 --> 00:45:01,190
What? What? What's he doing?

964
00:45:01,590 --> 00:45:03,600
— What's that?
— Can he talk?

965
00:45:04,000 --> 00:45:05,730
— He can't talk.
— I don't think he can.

966
00:45:06,770 --> 00:45:09,570
He's making some gestures because he can't talk?

967
00:45:09,640 --> 00:45:12,170
— This is getting serious.
— Hey, watch out, watch out.

968
00:45:12,240 --> 00:45:14,210
— This is getting bad.
— Watch out, watch out!

969
00:45:14,270 --> 00:45:17,610
That's scary!

970
00:45:18,180 --> 00:45:21,350
Watch out, watch out, watch out!

971
00:45:21,410 --> 00:45:24,480
That's dangerous, he can't breathe.

972
00:45:25,190 --> 00:45:26,190
—He's running out of oxygen.
—Like...

973
00:45:26,250 --> 00:45:27,790
Can you gesture something to us?

974
00:45:28,320 --> 00:45:31,660
You want us to do something?

975
00:45:31,720 --> 00:45:33,460
Damn it, damn it, damn it,

976
00:45:33,530 --> 00:45:35,630
No man, oh no, watch out.

977
00:45:36,060 --> 00:45:37,500
This is the scariest one we've seen so far.

978
00:45:40,170 --> 00:45:41,670
—Watch out!
—He was at his limit!

979
00:45:41,730 --> 00:45:43,700
We knew that already.

980
00:45:43,770 --> 00:45:46,510
Is that one of those vegetable containers
they're selling at Costco?

981
00:45:46,740 --> 00:45:48,480
—The ones that are like—
—The vacuum ones, right?

982
00:45:48,540 --> 00:45:52,280
Yeah, one of those.
They're super tight.

983
00:45:52,810 --> 00:45:54,180
Isn't this a Tenga thing, though?

984
00:45:54,280 --> 00:45:56,080
A Tenga Egg, right? (EN: 12)

985
00:45:56,150 --> 00:45:59,490
What are you trying to do?
Wanna talk?

986
00:45:59,720 --> 00:46:01,920
Can you talk? You can't talk?

987
00:46:02,560 --> 00:46:04,560
You're not able to talk?

988
00:46:05,690 --> 00:46:07,460
—Calm down.
—Damn it, damn it!

989
00:46:07,530 --> 00:46:09,600
— This is bad.
— There we go, there we go!

990
00:46:10,730 --> 00:46:13,470
Yeah, this is the scariest part.

991
00:46:13,530 --> 00:46:14,800
There he goes again.

992
00:46:15,440 --> 00:46:17,400
— Ah, it didn't work.
— That's pretty bad!

993
00:46:17,470 --> 00:46:18,770
No way, no way, no way!

994
00:46:27,150 --> 00:46:29,720
—Stop it...
—Who was it?

995
00:46:29,780 --> 00:46:31,650
—Fujita, right?
—Fujita?

996
00:46:32,450 --> 00:46:33,950
By the way, what time is it, Fujita?

997
00:46:34,020 --> 00:46:36,390
I don't have the time.

998
00:46:36,460 --> 00:46:37,460
And the pizza's still not here.

999
00:46:38,290 --> 00:46:39,890
That was pretty funny.

1000
00:46:40,190 --> 00:46:41,860
Isn't that pretty cool?

1001
00:46:42,560 --> 00:46:44,730
—That was fun!
—I know, no way.

1002
00:46:44,800 --> 00:46:46,170
I was laughing all the time.

1003
00:46:46,230 --> 00:46:47,670
For real?

1004
00:46:47,730 --> 00:46:49,600
I was having fun all the time.

1005
00:46:50,040 --> 00:46:51,340
— Who was that?
— Who laughed?

1006
00:46:51,400 --> 00:46:52,970
—Fujita.
—I knew it!

1007
00:46:53,040 --> 00:46:55,580
—He was laughing for sure!
—Did it many times, too.

1008
00:46:56,110 --> 00:46:57,810
Yeah, right, many times.

1009
00:46:57,880 --> 00:46:59,280
You laughed earlier for sure.

1010
00:47:00,450 --> 00:47:01,450
That's earlier, right?

1011
00:47:01,510 --> 00:47:02,780
With Shouji?

1012
00:47:03,750 --> 00:47:06,190
So yeah...

1013
00:47:07,820 --> 00:47:09,620
—Calm down!
—Damn it, damn it!

1014
00:47:09,690 --> 00:47:11,760
—This is bad!
—There we go, there we go!

1015
00:47:12,960 --> 00:47:16,100
Yeah, this is the scariest part.

1016
00:47:17,430 --> 00:47:19,530
—Ah, it didn't work.
—This is bad!

1017
00:47:19,600 --> 00:47:20,800
No way, no way!

1018
00:47:25,570 --> 00:47:27,070
No way!

1019
00:47:27,640 --> 00:47:31,140
If you're gonna do that just laugh already!

1020
00:47:31,410 --> 00:47:32,950
He didn't even fully—

1021
00:47:33,010 --> 00:47:35,110
— I was breaking a sweat back there.
— Is this the first time?

1022
00:47:35,180 --> 00:47:36,780
— First time, yeah.
— I see.

1023
00:47:37,020 --> 00:47:40,290
It was scary but funny.

1024
00:47:40,350 --> 00:47:43,090
Fujita... what did you have?

1025
00:47:43,160 --> 00:47:44,360
I'm already.

1026
00:47:44,560 --> 00:47:46,390
—You had this?
—Yeah, this one.

1027
00:47:46,460 --> 00:47:48,630
Can you take this, Fujita?

1028
00:47:48,700 --> 00:47:50,300
I cannot take it.

1029
00:47:50,800 --> 00:47:52,230
You got yourself in this mess.

1030
00:47:52,530 --> 00:47:54,000
It wasn't me.

1031
00:47:54,230 --> 00:47:55,940
—This is yours.
—It's not mine.

1032
00:47:56,000 --> 00:47:59,040
You only get this today,
but I'm going to get an ever thicker one next time.

1033
00:47:59,110 --> 00:48:01,070
—No, come on!
—Full platinum!

1034
00:48:01,510 --> 00:48:03,010
Something that looks like the real deal!

1035
00:48:03,080 --> 00:48:05,380
—Why do I get special treatment?
—I'm getting a professional one just for you.

1036
00:48:05,450 --> 00:48:07,780
There's no professional card,
this is the real deal!

1037
00:48:08,150 --> 00:48:09,280
This is the professional card already.

1038
00:48:09,350 --> 00:48:10,780
It's too thin, yeah.

1039
00:48:10,850 --> 00:48:11,850
Fujita, you're out!

1040
00:48:18,190 --> 00:48:21,130
I can't believe you all managed to stand
Chance's songs!

1041
00:48:21,190 --> 00:48:23,300
—They were good songs!
—It was pretty good!

1042
00:48:23,360 --> 00:48:25,230
That was a mess.

1043
00:48:25,300 --> 00:48:26,730
—They were great songs.
—How was that?

1044
00:48:26,800 --> 00:48:28,500
—Pretty good!
—"Tokyo Boy", yeah.

1045
00:48:28,570 --> 00:48:30,600
The three of them were original!

1046
00:48:30,670 --> 00:48:31,800
That's great.

1047
00:48:31,870 --> 00:48:33,670
What if Fujita is the one to make us laugh,

1048
00:48:33,740 --> 00:48:35,280
now that he became a zombie?

1049
00:48:35,610 --> 00:48:37,180
Yeah, right?

1050
00:48:37,240 --> 00:48:38,810
Okay,

1051
00:48:38,880 --> 00:48:40,910
—good job, everyone!
—Good job, good job.

1052
00:48:42,420 --> 00:48:44,180
What if Fujita actually makes us laugh
as a zombie?

1053
00:48:44,320 --> 00:48:45,020
— I think he could be the scariest.

1054
00:48:45,020 --> 00:48:46,620
— That was good.
— I think he could be the scariest.

1055
00:48:46,620 --> 00:48:47,550
I think he could be the scariest.

1056
00:48:47,950 --> 00:48:50,220
I'm not impressed with my results.

1057
00:48:50,820 --> 00:48:52,260
I never felt like

1058
00:48:52,330 --> 00:48:54,760
anything I did hit them
or made them really laugh.

1059
00:48:54,830 --> 00:48:56,000
Not once.

1060
00:48:56,060 --> 00:48:57,730
—That's no fun!
—It's fun.

1061
00:48:57,800 --> 00:48:59,400
—Then hurry up!
—Why third place?

1062
00:48:59,470 --> 00:49:00,730
Just do something already!

1063
00:49:00,800 --> 00:49:03,270
—Get them right, then!
—Just show us third place!

1064
00:49:03,340 --> 00:49:04,340
Get it right!

1065
00:49:04,400 --> 00:49:07,410
What you usually regret is not being able
to do what you had planned,

1066
00:49:07,470 --> 00:49:09,610
and then feeling bad because you couldn't do
this or that,

1067
00:49:09,680 --> 00:49:11,380
or you didn't try something at the right time.

1068
00:49:11,440 --> 00:49:13,650
So I'm glad I took so many swings.

1069
00:49:13,880 --> 00:49:17,450
They just didn't land.

1070
00:49:22,290 --> 00:49:23,520
Alright...

1071
00:49:26,690 --> 00:49:27,830
It's like you don't—

1072
00:49:27,890 --> 00:49:29,460
—Right?
—Oshiro, Oshiro.

1073
00:49:30,300 --> 00:49:31,530
Should we call in the Zombies?

1074
00:49:32,170 --> 00:49:32,600
— Here we go.

1075
00:49:32,600 --> 00:49:33,270
— We can always go one time per person.
— Here we go.

1076
00:49:33,270 --> 00:49:34,330
— We can always go one time per person.

1077
00:49:34,400 --> 00:49:36,140
"Zombie time!"

1078
00:49:36,200 --> 00:49:37,940
It's time!

1079
00:49:40,570 --> 00:49:41,970
Get ready for zombies!

1080
00:49:43,910 --> 00:49:45,480
Whoa...

1081
00:49:46,080 --> 00:49:48,050
—That's a sweater to get laid, for sure.
—Really...

1082
00:49:48,350 --> 00:49:50,020
This looks like trouble.

1083
00:49:52,390 --> 00:49:53,950
Didn't take him much to get here.

1084
00:49:55,360 --> 00:49:57,520
Just one second after the "Zombie Time", huh?

1085
00:49:58,090 --> 00:50:00,060
What are you eating?

1086
00:50:00,130 --> 00:50:02,900
That looks really good?

1087
00:50:06,430 --> 00:50:08,700
—They're popping!
—They're poprocks, huh?

1088
00:50:08,770 --> 00:50:11,300
Keep it up.

1089
00:50:12,340 --> 00:50:13,340
Ready?

1090
00:50:13,770 --> 00:50:15,040
You gonna talk with poprocks?

1091
00:50:15,440 --> 00:50:16,680
Sounds like you're chewing on aluminum foil.

1092
00:50:16,740 --> 00:50:17,940
Like pop pop pop!

1093
00:50:18,710 --> 00:50:21,210
Whoa...

1094
00:50:21,280 --> 00:50:22,980
—Popping sushi?
—Popshi?

1095
00:50:23,050 --> 00:50:24,350
— Whoa!
—Popshi?

1096
00:50:24,420 --> 00:50:25,490
Are you a woman?

1097
00:50:26,990 --> 00:50:28,150
Are you a guy?

1098
00:50:31,920 --> 00:50:33,830
Don't make that face.
Especially that sound...

1099
00:50:33,890 --> 00:50:34,890
It's annoying to hear...

1100
00:50:34,960 --> 00:50:36,760
Can you answer any questions?

1101
00:50:37,660 --> 00:50:39,300
You're a girl?

1102
00:50:40,870 --> 00:50:42,200
Grab his ass, and you'll find out.

1103
00:50:43,900 --> 00:50:45,410
That's a nice ass.

1104
00:50:45,770 --> 00:50:48,340
Stop it with that face.

1105
00:50:48,410 --> 00:50:50,340
That's an impressive way to move his eyes!

1106
00:50:50,410 --> 00:50:51,540
They're like angled
but somehow smiling?

1107
00:50:51,610 --> 00:50:52,810
What about his tits?

1108
00:50:52,880 --> 00:50:54,550
This is pretty stupid.

1109
00:50:55,350 --> 00:50:57,650
—They're all idiots, for real.
—He has a nice rack, huh?

1110
00:50:57,720 --> 00:50:59,350
Fujimoto-san, I'm sure it's been a long time, huh?

1111
00:50:59,420 --> 00:51:00,720
Not really.

1112
00:51:01,020 --> 00:51:03,020
—Who are you?
—Huh?

1113
00:51:03,090 --> 00:51:04,120
Who are you?

1114
00:51:04,320 --> 00:51:05,790
—Me?
—Yeah!

1115
00:51:07,390 --> 00:51:08,630
I'm Pachio. (EN: 13)

1116
00:51:09,900 --> 00:51:10,960
What?

1117
00:51:11,030 --> 00:51:12,230
—Pachio?
—I'm Pachio.

1118
00:51:12,300 --> 00:51:13,570
—Ah, because of the sound?
—Yes.

1119
00:51:13,630 --> 00:51:15,570
So you're a guy?

1120
00:51:15,640 --> 00:51:18,200
Whoa! That's pretty loud!

1121
00:51:18,270 --> 00:51:21,140
That's crazy.
It's really like biting on aluminum foil.

1122
00:51:21,410 --> 00:51:23,180
Just like...

1123
00:51:23,910 --> 00:51:26,080
—It's like he's frying tempura.
—For real!

1124
00:51:27,710 --> 00:51:29,750
Why did you come here, Pachio-san?

1125
00:51:29,980 --> 00:51:31,450
—Sorry?
—What are you doing?

1126
00:51:32,290 --> 00:51:33,420
Why are you here, Pachio-san?

1127
00:51:33,490 --> 00:51:35,690
Did you have any business with us?

1128
00:51:35,760 --> 00:51:38,060
—I just thought you looked troubled.
—About what?

1129
00:51:38,120 --> 00:51:39,460
Did you come to cheer on us?

1130
00:51:39,530 --> 00:51:41,090
Yes, you looked troubled.

1131
00:51:41,430 --> 00:51:44,460
There's nothing you can do,
so you may leave already. We're fine.

1132
00:51:44,530 --> 00:51:45,670
You haven't been doing anything.

1133
00:51:45,730 --> 00:51:47,100
Just leave already.

1134
00:51:47,170 --> 00:51:49,670
Wanna do some Mario gag once Pachio-san leaves?

1135
00:51:49,740 --> 00:51:51,440
—Let's do that.
—Right?

1136
00:51:52,070 --> 00:51:53,410
Wanna watch, Mario-san?

1137
00:51:53,710 --> 00:51:54,810
Mario-san?

1138
00:51:55,270 --> 00:51:56,640
Didn't you just call me Mario-san?

1139
00:51:56,710 --> 00:51:58,780
You got them mixed up.

1140
00:52:01,150 --> 00:52:03,020
Yeah, I just called him Mario-san,

1141
00:52:03,080 --> 00:52:04,080
because he's Pachio-san.

1142
00:52:04,150 --> 00:52:05,490
Right. I said Mario-san.

1143
00:52:05,550 --> 00:52:06,750
Right. Oh, you stink!

1144
00:52:08,960 --> 00:52:09,960
Sorry, wait a second.

1145
00:52:10,020 --> 00:52:11,290
Your breath stinks!

1146
00:52:13,130 --> 00:52:14,260
Okay, I'll get going.

1147
00:52:14,730 --> 00:52:16,430
Thank you very much!
Stop that already.

1148
00:52:16,500 --> 00:52:17,730
It's not that bad anyways.

1149
00:52:17,800 --> 00:52:19,400
Then come and smell my mouth.

1150
00:52:20,970 --> 00:52:22,440
I'll shut up if it stinks.

1151
00:52:23,140 --> 00:52:24,140
I don't care if yours stinks.

1152
00:52:24,200 --> 00:52:26,370
Because I know mine doesn't.
Stop lying about that.

1153
00:52:26,440 --> 00:52:28,210
Okay, it's a promise then.

1154
00:52:29,380 --> 00:52:30,880
—Stop if it it stinks, then!
—Okay.

1155
00:52:31,140 --> 00:52:32,580
Here I go.

1156
00:52:32,650 --> 00:52:33,710
That stinks man!

1157
00:52:35,850 --> 00:52:37,220
—What's your problem?
—Stop that already!

1158
00:52:37,280 --> 00:52:38,280
That was fucking gross!

1159
00:52:38,350 --> 00:52:40,690
— That hurts, so stop it.
— Ouch!

1160
00:52:40,750 --> 00:52:42,520
It really hurts like hell.
I had to do that earlier.

1161
00:52:42,590 --> 00:52:44,160
I promised, though.

1162
00:52:44,220 --> 00:52:45,290
That almost knocked me out.

1163
00:52:45,360 --> 00:52:46,730
Yeah, that's dangerous.

1164
00:52:46,890 --> 00:52:48,690
Aren't you exaggerating, Koumoto?

1165
00:52:48,760 --> 00:52:50,060
Maybe!

1166
00:52:50,130 --> 00:52:51,160
Huh?

1167
00:52:51,230 --> 00:52:54,500
You're making way too big a deal
out of this!

1168
00:52:55,570 --> 00:52:56,740
Come on.

1169
00:52:57,740 --> 00:52:59,610
That really hurts!

1170
00:53:00,010 --> 00:53:01,070
Wait, Koumoto.

1171
00:53:01,140 --> 00:53:02,540
This guy's really...?

1172
00:53:02,610 --> 00:53:04,240
—He's really going at it.
—For real.

1173
00:53:04,310 --> 00:53:07,510
Okay, I'm going to increase the strength gradually,

1174
00:53:08,150 --> 00:53:10,020
so tell me when you reach your limit.

1175
00:53:10,080 --> 00:53:11,650
—He's for real.
—I know, right?

1176
00:53:11,720 --> 00:53:13,650
—And stop after you reach it.
—Just after reaching his limit.

1177
00:53:13,720 --> 00:53:16,060
You can make me suffer all you want
if I go beyond your limit.

1178
00:53:16,120 --> 00:53:17,390
They've hit me 20 times already.

1179
00:53:17,460 --> 00:53:18,520
You know how many?

1180
00:53:18,590 --> 00:53:21,290
I'm getting a bruise already.

1181
00:53:21,490 --> 00:53:23,700
With this?

1182
00:53:24,100 --> 00:53:25,130
Yeah, it's fine.

1183
00:53:25,200 --> 00:53:26,470
—How's this?
—That's fine.

1184
00:53:26,700 --> 00:53:29,800
—How's this
—That hurts!

1185
00:53:30,540 --> 00:53:32,570
Ouch!

1186
00:53:36,640 --> 00:53:40,280
—Ouch!!
—You're smiling a little, aren't you?

1187
00:53:40,350 --> 00:53:43,080
I'm not smiling.
Not at all.

1188
00:53:43,150 --> 00:53:44,420
This is getting fun.

1189
00:53:44,620 --> 00:53:45,750
You're not gonna do it any more?

1190
00:53:45,820 --> 00:53:46,890
We're almost out of time anyways.

1191
00:53:46,950 --> 00:53:48,090
You're right. Time's out.

1192
00:53:48,150 --> 00:53:49,620
Yeah, this is pretty bad!

1193
00:53:49,890 --> 00:53:51,290
Are we gonna keep going from the middle?

1194
00:53:51,360 --> 00:53:52,360
—What do you mean?
—The game of the head.

1195
00:53:52,430 --> 00:53:53,730
Ah, that's right.

1196
00:53:53,790 --> 00:53:55,460
We've been ignoring it all this time.

1197
00:53:55,530 --> 00:53:56,700
Shouji, you have to look.

1198
00:53:56,760 --> 00:53:58,830
I was looking.
I can see everything from here.

1199
00:53:58,900 --> 00:54:00,570
I've been thinking about the Mario all this time.

1200
00:54:00,630 --> 00:54:02,130
I can see just fine.

1201
00:54:12,010 --> 00:54:13,710
What's that below his head? (EN: 14)

1202
00:54:16,680 --> 00:54:17,920
There he goes.

1203
00:54:18,020 --> 00:54:20,150
That was wrong?

1204
00:54:20,220 --> 00:54:22,290
You have to watch the head man...

1205
00:54:22,520 --> 00:54:24,460
Stop it with the "Ah!" already.

1206
00:54:41,110 --> 00:54:42,440
We've seen this already.

1207
00:54:43,410 --> 00:54:44,540
How many times are we gonna do this?

1208
00:54:44,610 --> 00:54:46,480
I love this.

1209
00:54:46,750 --> 00:54:50,280
Okay, let's keep going.

1210
00:54:51,080 --> 00:54:52,390
How many are there?

1211
00:54:52,450 --> 00:54:54,520
—Look there, right there.
—There it is.

1212
00:54:54,590 --> 00:54:55,860
This is what you wanted to see, right?

1213
00:55:05,500 --> 00:55:07,530
— Okay, next one?
— No, that's not it, right?

1214
00:55:07,600 --> 00:55:09,270
We saw this earlier.

1215
00:55:09,340 --> 00:55:12,100
Ah, that's right.
I think you haven't seen what comes next.

1216
00:55:12,170 --> 00:55:14,270
—It's the same!
—No, this is different.

1217
00:55:14,340 --> 00:55:15,710
—This is different?
—Yeah.

1218
00:55:23,380 --> 00:55:24,380
Are you seeing this?

1219
00:55:24,450 --> 00:55:25,450
Huh?

1220
00:55:25,520 --> 00:55:27,220
I have another one.

1221
00:55:27,290 --> 00:55:28,790
I don't think I can take the hand.

1222
00:55:29,790 --> 00:55:31,860
—This is the one with the hand, right?
—This is rough.

1223
00:55:32,390 --> 00:55:36,460
This is pretty different.
Moto-san sure is slow, though.

1224
00:55:36,530 --> 00:55:38,100
He's just a little cautious.

1225
00:55:41,500 --> 00:55:42,570
Isn't this the one with the hand?

1226
00:55:42,640 --> 00:55:43,640
It's a different version.

1227
00:55:43,700 --> 00:55:45,400
There's the one with the hand
and another one.

1228
00:55:49,180 --> 00:55:50,780
Ah, it was the one with the hand.
Sorry.

1229
00:56:00,090 --> 00:56:02,150
Alright. I was waiting for a new one.

1230
00:56:08,590 --> 00:56:10,600
—This is different?
—What's this?

1231
00:56:10,660 --> 00:56:12,800
—We hadn't seen this.
—You have to jump?

1232
00:56:12,870 --> 00:56:13,330
I think it's the same.

1233
00:56:13,330 --> 00:56:13,900
It's the same.

1234
00:56:13,970 --> 00:56:15,570
That's something else.

1235
00:56:16,940 --> 00:56:18,100
I get it now.

1236
00:56:19,540 --> 00:56:20,570
That's...

1237
00:56:33,320 --> 00:56:36,360
So he still dies?

1238
00:56:38,460 --> 00:56:40,290
How many do you have?

1239
00:56:40,360 --> 00:56:43,800
Why did he die after riding on Gucci-san's head?

1240
00:56:44,030 --> 00:56:45,800
This is still just level 1-1.

1241
00:56:46,230 --> 00:56:48,170
What's that sound?

1242
00:56:48,970 --> 00:56:52,340
What's that?
Something's spinning?

1243
00:56:52,910 --> 00:56:54,970
Isn't that Takahashi Meijin? (EN: 15)

1244
00:56:56,280 --> 00:56:57,810
Takahashi Meijin...

1245
00:56:58,310 --> 00:57:00,010
—Ah!
—Endless bouncing.

1246
00:57:01,480 --> 00:57:03,120
—This is endless.
—He keeps going.

1247
00:57:03,180 --> 00:57:04,920
So 16 shots?

1248
00:57:04,980 --> 00:57:06,450
—Huh?
—The ground's fucked.

1249
00:57:15,330 --> 00:57:16,730
Wh-Why?

1250
00:57:16,800 --> 00:57:18,230
He did that himself.

1251
00:57:18,300 --> 00:57:19,300
Why?

1252
00:57:19,600 --> 00:57:21,130
Come on... why?

1253
00:57:21,200 --> 00:57:22,740
Listen.

1254
00:57:23,070 --> 00:57:24,440
—What's going on?
—Huh?

1255
00:57:27,410 --> 00:57:28,410
She's cute.

1256
00:57:28,970 --> 00:57:30,940
Huh? What happened to Fuyuki-san?

1257
00:57:34,050 --> 00:57:35,180
This one's actually kinda scary.

1258
00:57:38,020 --> 00:57:39,020
That's enough, that's enough.

1259
00:57:39,080 --> 00:57:41,190
—This is scarier than Moto-san.
—We had enough, right?

1260
00:57:41,920 --> 00:57:43,690
The cute one's scarier.

1261
00:57:45,790 --> 00:57:47,190
Watch out damn it!

1262
00:57:51,760 --> 00:57:53,870
— Come on...
— Not that.

1263
00:57:55,400 --> 00:57:58,000
Stop it, Coo, that's enough.

1264
00:57:58,770 --> 00:58:00,940
Come on. That's good enough.

1265
00:58:01,010 --> 00:58:03,340
You're always at 0 points.

1266
00:58:03,410 --> 00:58:05,510
That's enough Coo.
Stop it already, please.

1267
00:58:05,580 --> 00:58:06,910
Sorry, you got 200.

1268
00:58:06,980 --> 00:58:09,380
That's not it?

1269
00:58:09,450 --> 00:58:11,050
— What's going on?!
— Ah!

1270
00:58:18,720 --> 00:58:19,960
Don't die right away, man!

1271
00:58:22,560 --> 00:58:24,760
—This is a different screen!
—You didn't clear it, though?

1272
00:58:27,430 --> 00:58:29,470
It's impossible, for real.

1273
00:58:29,540 --> 00:58:30,970
This isn't normally possible.

1274
00:58:31,040 --> 00:58:32,200
That's enough, Coo.

1275
00:58:32,440 --> 00:58:34,510
Really, I've had enough.

1276
00:58:34,570 --> 00:58:35,980
—Damn it.
—Huh?

1277
00:58:36,540 --> 00:58:38,280
—Only 16 minutes left.
—Ah, that's weird.

1278
00:58:38,580 --> 00:58:40,010
Which one was better?

1279
00:58:40,080 --> 00:58:41,180
They were all good.

1280
00:58:47,990 --> 00:58:51,390
—Zombie time.
—Huh?!

1281
00:58:58,330 --> 00:58:59,600
This sucks!

1282
00:58:59,670 --> 00:59:02,030
Whoa!

1283
00:59:03,570 --> 00:59:04,740
This is pretty gutsy.

1284
00:59:04,800 --> 00:59:06,840
Yeah, it's pretty tight already.

1285
00:59:07,070 --> 00:59:08,710
We're really tight on time.

1286
00:59:15,210 --> 00:59:17,220
We have an expert here.

1287
00:59:23,420 --> 00:59:24,460
Huh?

1288
00:59:25,520 --> 00:59:27,390
You're still here, Toku-san?

1289
00:59:27,890 --> 00:59:30,130
—The boss told me to stay!
—Okay.

1290
00:59:30,200 --> 00:59:34,100
He told me to write a report
on this list right here.

1291
00:59:35,070 --> 00:59:36,900
Of course it's going to be a pain in the ass
for a detective

1292
00:59:36,970 --> 00:59:39,040
who has been working on his feet
all this time, like me.

1293
00:59:39,100 --> 00:59:40,970
What are you talking about?

1294
00:59:41,040 --> 00:59:43,310
This is pretty easy to use
if you just take the time to learn.

1295
00:59:43,380 --> 00:59:44,780
I like their acting quite a bit.

1296
00:59:44,840 --> 00:59:46,480
—It's just that...
—Yeah?

1297
00:59:46,750 --> 00:59:50,520
My daughter's husband bought one for me.

1298
00:59:50,580 --> 00:59:53,090
That's a nice son-in-law!
And you don't use it?

1299
00:59:53,950 --> 00:59:56,390
I only open it to look stuff up.

1300
00:59:56,460 --> 00:59:57,720
—I see...
—For the most part...

1301
00:59:57,790 --> 00:59:59,090
it's just sitting there gathering dust.

1302
01:00:02,390 --> 01:00:03,560
—Hey,
—Yeah?

1303
01:00:03,630 --> 01:00:04,800
How's your mom doing?

1304
01:00:04,860 --> 01:00:06,900
Thank you for asking.

1305
01:00:06,970 --> 01:00:08,730
Thankfully, she's getting discharged in two days.

1306
01:00:08,800 --> 01:00:11,240
That's good to hear.
Have you been visiting her?

1307
01:00:11,300 --> 01:00:12,640
I haven't.

1308
01:00:13,070 --> 01:00:14,540
Visit her, you idiot!

1309
01:00:14,610 --> 01:00:16,040
—Okay.
—Listen, man,

1310
01:00:16,410 --> 01:00:19,180
You think someone who doesn't appreciate his parents
can do a good job?

1311
01:00:19,480 --> 01:00:20,550
—Well?
—You're right.

1312
01:00:20,610 --> 01:00:22,350
So visit her tomorrow, okay?

1313
01:00:22,410 --> 01:00:24,020
That's enough,
go home already.

1314
01:00:24,850 --> 01:00:26,620
He's pretty good at acting.

1315
01:00:27,150 --> 01:00:28,290
What are you doing?

1316
01:00:29,250 --> 01:00:30,260
I'm staying with you.

1317
01:00:30,320 --> 01:00:32,460
You're like a father to me, Toku-san.

1318
01:00:32,760 --> 01:00:34,960
And I can't do my job if I don't take care of my parents.

1319
01:00:35,030 --> 01:00:37,300
What are you talking about, man?

1320
01:00:37,930 --> 01:00:39,000
Okay, here I go.

1321
01:00:40,070 --> 01:00:41,400

Lubricant.

1339
01:01:52,340 --> 01:01:54,610
— That's quick!
— Extremely quick!

I don't get the rules.

Harisembon Haruka.

— Huh? Huh?
— Huh?

1383
01:03:30,740 --> 01:03:32,240
It's not just chubby girls?

1384
01:03:32,740 --> 01:03:36,140
I don't get it.

1385
01:03:38,540 --> 01:03:41,880
Okay, Shinbashi's Hostess.

1386
01:03:42,680 --> 01:03:48,050

1388
01:03:49,660 --> 01:03:51,760
— It's wrong?
— Well then...

Maid... ca...fe...

1399
01:04:08,440 --> 01:04:10,140
— employee.
— It worked with "employee"!

1400
01:04:10,210 --> 01:04:11,840
Why did "employee" work?!

1401
01:04:11,910 --> 01:04:13,210
Employee...

1402
01:04:13,410 --> 01:04:14,750
He likes inexperienced girls?

1403
01:04:14,810 --> 01:04:16,580

So "female" didn't work?

1410
01:04:28,330 --> 01:04:29,730
—He loves employees.
—Maybe it's the uniform.

1411
01:04:29,800 --> 01:04:31,200
The uniform?

1412
01:04:31,900 --> 01:04:32,970
The uniform.

1413
01:04:33,400 --> 01:04:34,500
Nurse!

1414
01:04:35,370 --> 01:04:38,670
—Nur...se...
—Huh?!

1415
01:04:38,740 --> 01:04:40,410
It's too vague. Employment?

1416
01:04:40,470 --> 01:04:41,940
—What about CA?
—CA? (EN: 18)

1417
01:04:42,010 --> 01:04:44,580
—CA
—He loves that!

1418
01:04:44,640 --> 01:04:45,640
Employee and CA.

1419
01:04:45,710 --> 01:04:47,950
CA...
All...

1420
01:04:48,010 --> 01:04:51,080
—All Nippon Airways?
—All Nippon CA.

1421
01:04:51,150 --> 01:04:52,020
All... Nip...pon...

1422
01:04:52,020 --> 01:04:53,650
Huh?!
All... Nip...pon...

1423
01:04:53,650 --> 01:04:54,550
All... Nip...pon...

1424
01:04:54,620 --> 01:04:55,690
CA.

1425
01:04:56,220 --> 01:04:57,590
And CA, yeah.

1426
01:04:57,660 --> 01:04:59,390
—JAL CA.
—JAL CA.

1427
01:04:59,460 --> 01:05:00,960
So it's JAL!

1428
01:05:01,030 --> 01:05:02,090
JAL, huh?!

1429
01:05:02,530 --> 01:05:04,460
—I love it!
—JAL?!

1430
01:05:04,930 --> 01:05:06,500
Can I try another one?

1431
01:05:06,570 --> 01:05:08,230
It might not be just about CAs.

1432
01:05:08,300 --> 01:05:09,700
Read from here, then.

1433
01:05:13,570 --> 01:05:17,280
Big tits large enough to look like
giant armadillos...

1434
01:05:19,140 --> 01:05:20,150
What are you talking about?

1435
01:05:20,680 --> 01:05:22,310
How long are you gonna keep that up?

1436
01:05:24,450 --> 01:05:25,550
Hey.

1437
01:05:25,620 --> 01:05:28,620
Well, a long time ago,
we went drinking to an Umehara bar.

1438
01:05:28,690 --> 01:05:30,160
And this lady with two huge tits
big enough to be armadillos

1439
01:05:30,220 --> 01:05:32,590
like that around her chest,

1440
01:05:32,660 --> 01:05:33,730
ended up leaving with us.

1441
01:05:34,230 --> 01:05:35,360
I've heard that before!

1442
01:05:35,430 --> 01:05:36,430
That was quick.

1443
01:05:36,500 --> 01:05:38,330
So he ended up taking Takahashi's girl?

1444
01:05:40,270 --> 01:05:41,300
Junior did that?

1445
01:05:41,370 --> 01:05:43,570
—The girl Takahashi wanted...?
—That was how years ago?

1446
01:05:43,640 --> 01:05:45,170
That was like 2 years ago, right?

1447
01:05:45,240 --> 01:05:47,470
—Liar!
—Two years?!

1448
01:05:47,670 --> 01:05:49,010
It was more than ten years ago.

1449
01:05:49,070 --> 01:05:50,080
Two years?

1450
01:05:50,140 --> 01:05:51,140
How tall was she?

1451
01:05:51,210 --> 01:05:52,310
She was like this tall.

1452
01:05:52,380 --> 01:05:54,510
—I knew it.
—She was pretty short.

1453
01:05:54,580 --> 01:05:55,780
Like 145cm...

1454
01:05:55,850 --> 01:05:57,980
And her legs were bending inwards
like this.

1455
01:05:58,050 --> 01:06:00,150
Yeah, she really looked

1456
01:06:00,220 --> 01:06:02,850
like one of those statues from the Osaka period.

1457
01:06:03,520 --> 01:06:04,560
No way.

1458
01:06:04,620 --> 01:06:06,830
There was also another girl
with a forehead bigger than President Ohashi's.

1459
01:06:07,960 --> 01:06:09,430
It was really sticking out.

1460
01:06:09,490 --> 01:06:11,300
So in the end I ended up

1461
01:06:11,360 --> 01:06:13,070
leaving with the girl with the forehead bigger than
President Ohashi's.

1462
01:06:13,130 --> 01:06:14,130
It was like this.

1463
01:06:15,030 --> 01:06:16,870
And they were making out when
I came back from the bathroom.

1464
01:06:18,100 --> 01:06:19,600
When was that?

1465
01:06:19,670 --> 01:06:22,210
That's pretty nasty.

1466
01:06:22,270 --> 01:06:23,880
Only eight minutes left!

1467
01:06:23,940 --> 01:06:25,240
So what now?

1468
01:06:25,410 --> 01:06:26,680
There's no way now...

1469
01:06:26,750 --> 01:06:28,350
It was Cookie by far, right?

1470
01:06:28,550 --> 01:06:30,680
We gotta do something about that.

1471
01:06:30,750 --> 01:06:32,080
But Oshiro also has a good chance!

1472
01:06:32,150 --> 01:06:33,650
—Oshiro does, yeah!
—He got a few points in the beginning!

1473
01:06:33,720 --> 01:06:36,890
He did?
And he doesn't have many cards.

1474
01:06:36,960 --> 01:06:38,360
You're right, Oshiro...

1475
01:06:38,420 --> 01:06:40,030
He has no cards at all.

1476
01:06:40,090 --> 01:06:41,560
But cards cost a lot in the end.

1477
01:06:41,630 --> 01:06:43,230
—You win by points, so...
—Right, with points.

1478
01:06:43,300 --> 01:06:44,900
It's not by card number?!

1479
01:06:44,960 --> 01:06:47,370
Points obviously count when you have too many.

1480
01:06:48,530 --> 01:06:49,700
I made you all smile, though.

1481
01:06:49,770 --> 01:06:51,800
I couldn't help but smile even a little.

1482
01:06:51,870 --> 01:06:54,210
Smiling just a little is against the rules, right?

1483
01:06:54,270 --> 01:06:56,240
What are you doing to my ass, man?!

1484
01:06:56,640 --> 01:06:58,210
What are you doing, idiot?!
Stop it!

1485
01:06:58,580 --> 01:07:00,510
Can you stop that?!

1486
01:07:00,580 --> 01:07:01,880
Can you stop that?!

1487
01:07:01,950 --> 01:07:04,420
What are you doing?!
Can you stop that?!

1488
01:07:05,650 --> 01:07:07,190
I think even force won't be enough...

1489
01:07:07,290 --> 01:07:08,420
That'll only make me twitch like that!

1490
01:07:08,490 --> 01:07:11,220
Can you... can you stop that?!
Can you stop that?!

1491
01:07:11,890 --> 01:07:13,060
What are you doing?!

1492
01:07:14,990 --> 01:07:18,930
Earn a proper reaction!
Win fair and square!

1493
01:07:19,530 --> 01:07:20,630
Yeah, that's not really fair.

1494
01:07:20,700 --> 01:07:22,530
Win fair and square.
Can you stop that?

1495
01:07:23,170 --> 01:07:24,300
Damn it, look at the time.

1496
01:07:24,370 --> 01:07:25,400
How should we end it?

1497
01:07:25,470 --> 01:07:26,570
—What do we do?
—What do you want to do?

1498
01:07:26,640 --> 01:07:28,510
—What?
—Hey, hey!

1499
01:07:28,570 --> 01:07:29,570
—Hey!
—Who is that?

1500
01:07:29,640 --> 01:07:31,110
Hey!

1501
01:07:31,180 --> 01:07:32,680
Kamayatsu, Kamayatsu
Kamayatsu, Kamayatsu!! (EN: 19)

1502
01:07:32,740 --> 01:07:34,480
Oh! Kamayatsu?
Hey, hey, hey!

1503
01:07:39,080 --> 01:07:40,090
—Hey!
—He's pretty good!

1504
01:07:40,390 --> 01:07:44,220
The wife with the scabby nipples

1505
01:07:44,290 --> 01:07:48,090
gets upset at her husband
and puts betadine on him every day.

1506
01:07:48,160 --> 01:07:51,930
The wife with peeling nipples

1507
01:07:52,000 --> 01:07:56,130
gets upset at her father-in-law
and puts mentholatum on him every day.

1508
01:07:56,200 --> 01:08:00,510
Guess anything's better than having
shitty nipples.

1509
01:08:03,810 --> 01:08:07,410
The women with scabby and peeling nipples.

1510
01:08:07,480 --> 01:08:14,150
They're always upset
and putting medicine on someone else.

1511
01:08:17,160 --> 01:08:18,790
Rock n' roll!

1512
01:08:26,630 --> 01:08:28,000
What's next?

1513
01:08:28,830 --> 01:08:30,070
Come on, Cookie!

1514
01:08:30,070 --> 01:08:31,800
Wait, wait, wait, wait.
Come on, Cookie!

1515
01:08:31,800 --> 01:08:32,870
Wait, wait, wait, wait.

1516
01:08:32,940 --> 01:08:33,240
— Wait! Damn it!

1517
01:08:33,240 --> 01:08:35,870
— He's going to keep attacking?
— Wait! Damn it!

1518
01:08:37,180 --> 01:08:38,880
You gonna take my child away?

1519
01:08:38,940 --> 01:08:40,050
You sure blabber on, huh?

1520
01:08:40,110 --> 01:08:42,210
How can you say that to my child?!

1521
01:08:42,780 --> 01:08:45,320
Can you do that to my child?!

1522
01:08:45,380 --> 01:08:46,420
He's kinda cute.

1523
01:08:46,850 --> 01:08:48,290
Okay, take a good look.
Poor thing...

1524
01:08:48,490 --> 01:08:51,720
That's freaky.
Look, it's so freaky.

1525
01:08:51,790 --> 01:08:53,160
That's one freaky dude.

1526
01:08:53,230 --> 01:08:55,460
—It can't be helped...
—Because kids...

1527
01:08:56,190 --> 01:08:57,900
No, this guy isn't a child.

1528
01:08:57,960 --> 01:08:59,230
What do you think you're—
What are you going to do?!

1529
01:08:59,300 --> 01:09:00,730
—Here we go.
—Boy, come—

1530
01:09:01,670 --> 01:09:02,970
Ouch, damn it!

1531
01:09:03,740 --> 01:09:06,140
The sun's rising outside already?

1532
01:09:07,240 --> 01:09:10,910
It did, right? Hey.
I'm done.

1533
01:09:11,980 --> 01:09:12,980
Where are you going? Hey!

1534
01:09:13,040 --> 01:09:15,250
I wanted to do something,
but I don't think we're doing anything.

1535
01:09:15,310 --> 01:09:16,310
This is pretty good.

1536
01:09:16,380 --> 01:09:17,780
Give it back, give it back.

1537
01:09:17,850 --> 01:09:18,920
—Damn it.
—Give it back.

1538
01:09:19,150 --> 01:09:20,390
—Give it back, man.
—Damn it, damn it.

1539
01:09:20,450 --> 01:09:21,450
I'm not giving it back.

1540
01:09:21,520 --> 01:09:22,520
—Give it back.
—No.

1541
01:09:22,590 --> 01:09:23,590
Give it back.

1542
01:09:23,660 --> 01:09:25,760
If you're serious,
then take down that guy.

1543
01:09:25,820 --> 01:09:27,130
—Who?
—That guy.

1544
01:09:27,330 --> 01:09:29,630
Fine. Come here.

1545
01:09:32,400 --> 01:09:33,400
No way, no way.

1546
01:09:33,470 --> 01:09:34,470
I'm giving it back, here.

1547
01:09:39,840 --> 01:09:41,740
Go, go. Go on.

1548
01:09:46,410 --> 01:09:48,110
Stop, stop!

1549
01:09:48,180 --> 01:09:50,380
—You're gonna get hurt!

1550
01:09:50,450 --> 01:09:53,720
—Stop it already! Stop!
—You're gonna get hurt, you're gonna get hurt!!

1551
01:09:54,620 --> 01:09:55,620
Sorry.

1552
01:10:00,860 --> 01:10:02,130
Stop it, stop it.

1553
01:10:09,800 --> 01:10:12,300
Stop it.

1554
01:10:21,810 --> 01:10:24,520
—Good job!
—Good job, guys!

1555
01:10:24,580 --> 01:10:27,890
Well done!

1556
01:10:27,950 --> 01:10:29,450
This is the most tired
I've ever been.

1557
01:10:29,520 --> 01:10:31,420
That was intense.

1558
01:10:31,490 --> 01:10:34,390
The big shot's here!

1559
01:10:34,460 --> 01:10:37,460
It was worth it, though.

1560
01:10:37,530 --> 01:10:39,130
I'm exhausted.

1561
01:10:39,200 --> 01:10:40,470
The winner is...

1562
01:10:40,630 --> 01:10:41,930
Come on, man, give me a break.

1563
01:10:42,000 --> 01:10:43,270
I don't even have to say it, right?

1564
01:10:43,340 --> 01:10:46,100
—Cookie!
—Whoa!!

1565
01:10:46,400 --> 01:10:48,970
—Fuck yeah!!
—For the second time.

1566
01:10:50,080 --> 01:10:51,840
—Second time, right?
—Yeah, it's my second time.

1567
01:10:51,910 --> 01:10:55,980
—Well, well.
—Yeah!!

1568
01:10:56,850 --> 01:10:58,680
He was too good.

1569
01:10:59,650 --> 01:11:00,720
Alright!

1570
01:11:00,790 --> 01:11:02,150
His double takedown...

1571
01:11:02,220 --> 01:11:04,290
Yeah, he was great.

1572
01:11:04,860 --> 01:11:07,690
—That mario game was effective.
—Mario was just...

1573
01:11:07,760 --> 01:11:08,760
—It was too much.
—That was great.

1574
01:11:08,830 --> 01:11:11,600
I laughed enough for two whole months.

1575
01:11:11,660 --> 01:11:13,500
I'm glad to hear that!

1576
01:11:14,030 --> 01:11:16,000
—He destroyed us today.
—He totally did.

1577
01:11:16,070 --> 01:11:17,070
That was too much.

1578
01:11:17,140 --> 01:11:19,540
Especially with great laughs, right?

1579
01:11:20,210 --> 01:11:21,570
I wanted to watch everything, to be honest.

1580
01:11:21,640 --> 01:11:23,580
Right? Just watching was already hilarious.

1581
01:11:23,640 --> 01:11:25,810
You really wish you didn't get
disqualified for laughing, huh?

1582
01:11:25,880 --> 01:11:28,150
—Like a spectator.
—I wanted to laugh so bad.

1583
01:11:28,210 --> 01:11:29,910
Thank you very much!

1584
01:11:35,490 --> 01:11:36,920
Hell yeah!

1585
01:11:40,460 --> 01:11:43,030
—Good job!
—Good job out there!

1586
01:11:43,660 --> 01:11:47,200
Well yeah...
My brain was running at full speed today.

1587
01:11:47,370 --> 01:11:50,300
I couldn't stop for a single step.

1588
01:11:50,370 --> 01:11:52,470
That's what it felt like.

1589
01:11:55,070 --> 01:11:56,640
The moment I got the orange,

1590
01:11:56,710 --> 01:11:58,440
I felt pretty blown away, I guess.

1591
01:11:58,640 --> 01:12:00,550
Rock, paper, scissors!

1592
01:12:00,610 --> 01:12:01,710
Rock, paper—

1593
01:12:04,150 --> 01:12:05,720
Maybe I lost my mind,

1594
01:12:05,780 --> 01:12:08,390
but I actually felt more at ease
after that happened.

1595
01:12:08,450 --> 01:12:10,560
—This is pretty bad!
—There we go!

1596
01:12:10,620 --> 01:12:12,590
Like, I was losing from the beginning.

1597
01:12:14,030 --> 01:12:17,060
So I kind of felt like
it wasn't a big deal anymore.

1598
01:12:17,130 --> 01:12:18,260
This is bad, this is bad!

1599
01:12:18,330 --> 01:12:19,630
No way, no way!

1600
01:12:22,870 --> 01:12:25,640
But I became incredibly self-conscious
for the past 20 minutes.

1601
01:12:27,110 --> 01:12:29,310
"If I get through this,
I might pull it off."

1602
01:12:31,610 --> 01:12:33,850
—Good job!
—Good job to you too!

1603
01:12:34,650 --> 01:12:37,220
I feel really tired

1604
01:12:37,280 --> 01:12:38,780
just from laughing today.

1605
01:12:38,850 --> 01:12:41,650
I was really crying for real.
It was insane.

1606
01:12:41,720 --> 01:12:46,220
I guess that they weren't laughing that much,

1607
01:12:46,290 --> 01:12:48,460
because everything was funny all the time.

1608
01:12:48,660 --> 01:12:50,930
That happens sometimes.

1609
01:12:51,000 --> 01:12:55,400
And Chance Oshiro with that guitar...

1610
01:12:55,630 --> 01:12:59,670
To be honest, I was underestimating him.
I thought he was out of place.

1611
01:13:00,640 --> 01:13:01,910
But it was hilarious.

1612
01:13:02,140 --> 01:13:05,280
Love, love.

1613
01:13:05,340 --> 01:13:09,210
It was love at first sight.

1614
01:13:09,510 --> 01:13:12,620
—Love, love.
—This guy's an idiot.

1615
01:13:12,680 --> 01:13:16,490
—I'm a Tokyo Boy.
—He's a total idiot.

1616
01:13:16,550 --> 01:13:19,820
And of course, I don't even have to talk about Cookie.

1617
01:13:19,890 --> 01:13:24,300
I could watch him forever, seriously.

1618
01:13:26,460 --> 01:13:28,000
I guess this time...

1619
01:13:28,070 --> 01:13:31,270
it might've been better than usual

1620
01:13:31,340 --> 01:13:34,110
because we got scolded by Amazon.

1621
01:13:34,170 --> 01:13:36,070
Right?

1622
01:13:36,340 --> 01:13:38,080
It made us pay attention.

1623
01:13:38,640 --> 01:13:42,810
Like we had to be a bit more
honest about our gags,

1624
01:13:42,880 --> 01:13:46,750
and it ended up being incredibly good.

1625
01:13:46,820 --> 01:13:48,950
You said they scolded you, so...

1626
01:13:49,020 --> 01:13:52,520
Did you ever feel like a lingering
aura or something?

1627
01:13:52,590 --> 01:13:54,130
Like some sort of mood?

1628
01:13:54,190 --> 01:13:56,900
To be honest, well, I...

1629
01:13:56,960 --> 01:14:01,070
I like to say that I...
left things behind.

1630
01:14:01,930 --> 01:14:03,700
I got over that already somehow.

1631
01:14:03,770 --> 01:14:08,310
Though I think there were some people who might've liked it.

1632
01:14:08,370 --> 01:14:11,110
So uh...
I think that...

1633
01:14:11,180 --> 01:14:14,480
And I guess we reached the limit
of what we can actually do.

1634
01:14:14,550 --> 01:14:16,680
So I think that I'd like you all

1635
01:14:16,750 --> 01:14:20,590
to be able to watch it.

1636
01:14:20,790 --> 01:14:22,450
Though it's rated like R60+. (EN: 20)
