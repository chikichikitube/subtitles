Yamasaki Housei

45
00:01:32,110 --> 00:01:36,280
Has anyone been here before to watch this show?

46
00:01:36,510 --> 00:01:37,680
It's a long show.

47
00:01:38,310 --> 00:01:40,380
I see a few people.

48
00:01:40,380 --> 00:01:42,180
Well, you all look healthy now.

49
00:01:42,180 --> 00:01:45,080
But you'll be as good as dead in the end.

50
00:01:45,610 --> 00:01:48,540
A few people were rolling their eyes.

51
00:01:48,540 --> 00:01:49,880
Excuse me.

52
00:01:49,880 --> 00:01:51,710
"Rolling their eyes?"

53
00:01:52,980 --> 00:01:54,150
You got caught again.

54
00:01:54,190 --> 00:01:55,610
Everyone was laughing,

55
00:01:55,740 --> 00:01:56,940
as if rolling their eyes...

56
00:01:57,020 --> 00:01:58,320
He's really not funny.

57
00:01:59,510 --> 00:02:00,980
It didn't just begin now!

58
00:02:01,410 --> 00:02:02,610
It didn't just..?

59
00:02:02,680 --> 00:02:05,540
You guys are really being mean!

60
00:02:06,010 --> 00:02:08,510
You not being funny didn't start just now.

61
00:02:08,510 --> 00:02:10,510
So mean, really.

62
00:02:10,510 --> 00:02:13,480
This year's stage is airport.

63
00:02:13,480 --> 00:02:13,980
- Yes.

64
00:02:13,480 --> 00:02:13,980
Yes.

65
00:02:14,110 --> 00:02:16,580
Matsumoto-san, please start VTR.

66
00:02:14,940 --> 00:02:15,380
Yes.

67
00:02:16,580 --> 00:02:17,640
Please.

68
00:02:17,980 --> 00:02:20,580
Yes, because this is an annual event!

69
00:02:20,810 --> 00:02:21,910
Yooooou!!

70
00:02:26,780 --> 00:02:31,080
No-laughing Airport

71
00:02:33,140 --> 00:02:38,080
It's been 3 years since the last time we saw the morning sunlight shining bright.

72
00:02:38,430 --> 00:02:40,890
But the members..

73
00:02:41,710 --> 00:02:43,880
Everyone's walking heavily.

74
00:02:43,560 --> 00:02:44,060
Well..

75
00:02:45,010 --> 00:02:47,380
No, that's not it.

76
00:02:46,680 --> 00:02:47,380
Yeah.

77
00:02:47,480 --> 00:02:48,710
I have a fracture on my leg.

78
00:02:48,340 --> 00:02:49,440
Yes, right.

79
00:02:48,710 --> 00:02:55,210
My doctor told me not to do variety shows,

80
00:02:52,180 --> 00:02:55,210
not to even watch it.

81
00:02:53,440 --> 00:02:55,280
Can't even watch it?

82
00:02:55,440 --> 00:02:58,110
Aren't you just trying to get away?

83
00:02:58,340 --> 00:03:00,680
I'd be rather happy if that was the case.

84
00:03:01,110 --> 00:03:04,110
Matsumoto accidentally received a stress fracture.

85
00:03:04,110 --> 00:03:07,740
The future is not as clear as this sky...

86
00:03:08,240 --> 00:03:10,640
You can't even watch variety shows.

87
00:03:10,640 --> 00:03:13,340
He said it's dangerous.

88
00:03:13,410 --> 00:03:14,910
It says to wait here.

89
00:03:15,010 --> 00:03:16,310
So far the weather looks good.

90
00:03:16,280 --> 00:03:18,550
Yeah, if it was raining...

91
00:03:18,610 --> 00:03:20,210
The first sunny day in the 3 years.

92
00:03:20,280 --> 00:03:22,280
It's been 3 years?

93
00:03:22,280 --> 00:03:23,980
Yesterday, it was raining right?

94
00:03:23,780 --> 00:03:25,540
Last night, it was.

95
00:03:25,380 --> 00:03:26,540
Something is coming

96
00:03:26,540 --> 00:03:27,180
What's that noise?

97
00:03:28,380 --> 00:03:32,210
I can't tell if it's real or just for show.

98
00:03:32,340 --> 00:03:34,480
Yes, that's true. We can't tell at all.

99
00:03:34,580 --> 00:03:36,680
I'm sure that is for show.

100
00:03:37,910 --> 00:03:38,780
That's too strange.

101
00:03:38,880 --> 00:03:41,010
Such a long intro.

102
00:03:41,180 --> 00:03:44,980
That has to be Fujiwara, riding in back.

103
00:03:43,410 --> 00:03:44,310
It seems so.

104
00:03:45,940 --> 00:03:47,780
What is that?

105
00:03:53,410 --> 00:03:56,480
I really can't see the point of this.

106
00:03:55,380 --> 00:03:56,340
Me neither.

107
00:03:56,480 --> 00:03:59,140
I kind of like it.

108
00:03:58,710 --> 00:04:03,540
Even though it was already explained to us.
At this point, we still don't yet understand.

109
00:04:04,480 --> 00:04:05,380
Why did he go there?

110
00:04:05,410 --> 00:04:07,410
What?

111
00:04:07,410 --> 00:04:09,140
He threw it away.

112
00:04:09,140 --> 00:04:11,310
I'm popular..Good morning!

113
00:04:11,310 --> 00:04:14,210
I'm so popular.

114
00:04:14,210 --> 00:04:16,110
Is he a woman?

115
00:04:15,480 --> 00:04:16,280
Popular..

116
00:04:17,210 --> 00:04:20,110
I told him not to bring me flowers as it dies quickly.

117
00:04:17,410 --> 00:04:21,010
Downtown's former manager

118
00:04:17,410 --> 00:04:21,010
Fujiwara Hiroshi

119
00:04:21,080 --> 00:04:23,980
But he still brings some every time I see him.

120
00:04:24,580 --> 00:04:27,010
Your outfit is great again this year.

121
00:04:27,380 --> 00:04:31,140
Your face is getting even more disgusting.

122
00:04:31,140 --> 00:04:33,610
Year to year... now it's no better than a rice cooker.

123
00:04:36,510 --> 00:04:37,540
Yamasaki...

124
00:04:37,540 --> 00:04:37,980
Yes?

125
00:04:37,980 --> 00:04:40,440
Why do you think I'm popular?

126
00:04:42,410 --> 00:04:45,540
I guess it's because of your style. The appearance is good?

127
00:04:45,780 --> 00:04:48,440
It's because I am a cabin attendant!

128
00:04:49,580 --> 00:04:52,240
You can just see it from my outfit right?

129
00:04:52,240 --> 00:04:54,010
I'm popular because I am a cabin attend.

130
00:04:55,140 --> 00:04:56,240
Say it well.

131
00:04:56,240 --> 00:04:57,010
He can't even say it.

132
00:04:57,010 --> 00:04:59,410
I'm popular because I'm a cabin attendant!

133
00:04:59,480 --> 00:05:00,080
CA.

134
00:05:01,340 --> 00:05:05,310
This year's stage will be at the airport.

135
00:05:06,140 --> 00:05:08,480
This year, everyone is going to be..

136
00:05:08,480 --> 00:05:12,580
cabin attendants.  For short, it's "CA"

137
00:05:11,710 --> 00:05:12,440
Excuse me,

138
00:05:13,340 --> 00:05:14,940
but the sun is too bright.

139
00:05:15,980 --> 00:05:18,690
The 5 members will be cabin attendants.

140
00:05:16,210 --> 00:05:25,240
Newbie Cabin Attendants

141
00:05:16,210 --> 00:05:25,240
will challenge 24 hour duties!!

142
00:05:18,810 --> 00:05:25,280
They are going to challenge 24 hour duties, but one problem remains...

143
00:05:25,410 --> 00:05:28,340
Matsumoto, I heard

144
00:05:27,610 --> 00:05:28,340
about your leg...

145
00:05:28,510 --> 00:05:34,640
Yes, I was strictly told by my doctor not to repeatedly stand up and sit down.

146
00:05:29,310 --> 00:05:36,540
*Matsumoto received a stress fracture on his foot while
in training.   It will take 3 months to heal completely.

147
00:05:34,640 --> 00:05:37,440
He said "This is not a joke." by looking at the MRI.

148
00:05:37,780 --> 00:05:39,910
What was it?  What you deserve...

149
00:05:39,910 --> 00:05:41,140
Stress... Stress...

150
00:05:41,140 --> 00:05:43,480
Who deserves it?

151
00:05:43,480 --> 00:05:46,140
This is the results of my effort!

152
00:05:46,940 --> 00:05:48,510
What you deserve

153
00:05:46,940 --> 00:05:48,510
What you deserve

154
00:05:48,610 --> 00:05:51,680
Even though are stupid, you are the main character, so

155
00:05:51,840 --> 00:05:54,340
we've prepared some help for you.

156
00:05:54,340 --> 00:05:56,140
Come on!!

157
00:05:56,580 --> 00:05:57,210
Scary.

158
00:05:57,210 --> 00:05:58,780
They're scary.

159
00:05:58,710 --> 00:06:03,980
Matsumoto's personal SP

160
00:05:58,710 --> 00:06:03,980
Stair Servants

161
00:06:00,340 --> 00:06:01,810
They're huge.

162
00:06:01,810 --> 00:06:03,810
Scary.

163
00:06:04,040 --> 00:06:06,310
He's snorting like "Hm hm hm hm..."

164
00:06:06,110 --> 00:06:07,240
What are they doing?

165
00:06:07,680 --> 00:06:11,680
When Matsumoto can't move, they will come to assist him.

166
00:06:11,680 --> 00:06:12,710
Isn't it perfect?

167
00:06:16,110 --> 00:06:18,280
I kind of want them to carry me at the stairs.

168
00:06:18,280 --> 00:06:20,080
OK! Thank you!

169
00:06:20,210 --> 00:06:21,580
"OK thank you."

170
00:06:22,640 --> 00:06:27,680
By the way, I told you we will be cabin attend... What are you wearing?

171
00:06:25,640 --> 00:06:27,640
You never said it correctly. Never once.

172
00:06:27,740 --> 00:06:28,310
Well

173
00:06:28,580 --> 00:06:32,580
we've prepared your outfits there. Can you change now?

174
00:06:32,940 --> 00:06:39,610
Before starting CA duties

175
00:06:32,940 --> 00:06:39,610
Changing into suitable outfits

176
00:06:33,010 --> 00:06:36,480
First of all, they will change into suitable cabin attendant outfits.

177
00:06:36,810 --> 00:06:38,980
Isn't it getting too cold to change?

178
00:06:39,510 --> 00:06:42,680
This was a nice day though.

179
00:06:40,340 --> 00:06:42,610
Why don't you respond?

180
00:06:43,440 --> 00:06:45,640
Please come out in order.

181
00:06:45,880 --> 00:06:46,610
Matsumoto.

182
00:06:46,940 --> 00:06:47,480
Yes.

183
00:06:49,710 --> 00:06:51,110
I'm glad to be first up.

184
00:06:51,110 --> 00:06:51,980
First up is good.

185
00:06:51,940 --> 00:06:57,880
What he deserves, Fracture CA

186
00:06:52,010 --> 00:06:53,010
Normal uniform.

187
00:06:54,140 --> 00:06:56,580
Everything gonna be great.

188
00:06:56,580 --> 00:06:57,840
My leg is broken.

189
00:07:00,210 --> 00:07:01,110
Sorry...

190
00:07:01,040 --> 00:07:01,910
Yamazaki.

191
00:07:01,910 --> 00:07:02,840
Yes.

192
00:07:04,380 --> 00:07:05,840
You're cute, Yamasaki.

00:07:07,780 --> 00:07:08,610
Cute.

195
00:07:08,610 --> 00:07:10,080
As a teddy bear.

You're beautiful, Endo.

200
00:07:19,210 --> 00:07:23,780
Handsome Super Perverted CA

201
00:07:21,440 --> 00:07:22,340
No need for "Perverted"

202
00:07:23,040 --> 00:07:25,040
Please try your best.

203
00:07:25,040 --> 00:07:25,710
OK!

204
00:07:25,880 --> 00:07:26,510
Tanaka.

205
00:07:26,810 --> 00:07:27,380
Yes.

206
00:07:29,780 --> 00:07:31,410
You're slender.

207
00:07:32,080 --> 00:07:36,910
Tall and Dirty CA

208
00:07:32,540 --> 00:07:34,410
You look like a Hollywood actress.

209
00:07:36,310 --> 00:07:37,840
Shouldn't be dirty, huh?

210
00:07:37,410 --> 00:07:38,180
Hamada.

211
00:07:41,810 --> 00:07:43,880
Hamada! What's that?

212
00:07:44,410 --> 00:07:49,940
Mini Skirt & Big boobs CA

213
00:07:46,410 --> 00:07:47,480
Sexy!

214
00:07:47,810 --> 00:07:49,480
You've grown very well.

215
00:07:49,940 --> 00:07:52,710
I assume it's an I cup.

216
00:07:52,710 --> 00:07:55,180
Yamazaki should do this.

217
00:07:55,180 --> 00:07:56,240
What do you mean?

218
00:07:56,240 --> 00:08:00,010
It's too sexy for prime time.

219
00:08:00,140 --> 00:08:01,010
What the..

220
00:08:01,010 --> 00:08:02,110
Never mind.

221
00:08:03,080 --> 00:08:04,710
I'll explain the rules.

222
00:08:04,710 --> 00:08:06,710
Could you stand in a row?

223
00:08:08,640 --> 00:08:10,310
Come forward..

224
00:08:10,710 --> 00:08:11,680
Let me begin.

225
00:08:11,710 --> 00:08:12,510
One,

226
00:08:14,280 --> 00:08:18,640
You will work as cabin attendants for 24 hours.

227
00:08:19,580 --> 00:08:23,680
One, you are not allowed to laugh no matter what.

228
00:08:24,640 --> 00:08:29,010
One, if you laugh, you will receive a punishment.

229
00:08:29,540 --> 00:08:30,410
That's all.

230
00:08:31,780 --> 00:08:32,810
Did you get it?

231
00:08:33,380 --> 00:08:34,280
Alright!

232
00:08:34,240 --> 00:08:38,110
Everyone, are you ready for flight!?

233
00:08:39,610 --> 00:08:41,580
Are you ready for flight!?

234
00:08:43,240 --> 00:08:46,010
Everyone... Are you ready!?

235
00:08:46,440 --> 00:08:48,940
Are you ready!?

236
00:08:48,480 --> 00:08:49,780
Persistent.

237
00:08:50,110 --> 00:08:52,680
So, there is a bus stop over there.

238
00:08:52,680 --> 00:08:54,780
No one responded!

239
00:08:55,480 --> 00:09:00,180
I thought you would have another version if we didn't agree.

240
00:08:58,880 --> 00:09:00,210
No, he didn't.

241
00:09:00,310 --> 00:09:02,480
It's true, no one had agreed yet though

242
00:09:03,910 --> 00:09:07,180
Can you stand in a line here?  The bus is coming.

243
00:09:05,610 --> 00:09:07,180
Uh bus!

244
00:09:07,180 --> 00:09:08,410
A bus is coming?

245
00:09:10,380 --> 00:09:12,840
Shall we get on...

246
00:09:11,780 --> 00:09:13,010
Are we going to?

247
00:09:12,840 --> 00:09:14,480
It's coming.

248
00:09:14,540 --> 00:09:15,410
It's coming.

249
00:09:15,410 --> 00:09:17,410
Here it comes.

250
00:09:18,310 --> 00:09:21,780
Sure enough, it has "Kurobikari" in the name.

251
00:09:21,780 --> 00:09:24,210
Gasu Airline System.

252
00:09:24,540 --> 00:09:25,510
Kurobikari.

253
00:09:25,610 --> 00:09:27,280
Please look at this.

254
00:09:28,480 --> 00:09:33,910
G.A.S.  Gaasuu Kurobikari Airline System.

255
00:09:33,910 --> 00:09:38,240
This is the name of the airline you are going to work for.

256
00:09:39,410 --> 00:09:42,250
Gaasuu kurobikari Airline System

257
00:09:42,880 --> 00:09:45,640
The Gaasuu commute bus.

258
00:09:45,940 --> 00:09:48,910
Suga Duck

259
00:09:46,180 --> 00:09:53,680
With the Suga duck symbol on its body, this is a special bus for the GAS employees.

260
00:09:54,080 --> 00:09:59,810
We are now going to the training school for cabin attendants.

261
00:09:59,810 --> 00:10:03,080
Aren't you thinking like " Why not the airport"?

262
00:10:03,210 --> 00:10:05,240
What is he's trying to say.

263
00:10:05,240 --> 00:10:07,710
You just want us to say that.

264
00:10:06,840 --> 00:10:07,640
We weren't thinking that.

265
00:10:07,710 --> 00:10:09,710
For newbies like you,

266
00:10:09,710 --> 00:10:10,580
Um..

267
00:10:11,140 --> 00:10:12,910
it's still too soon to go directly to the airport.

268
00:10:14,310 --> 00:10:18,740
Your thinking,

269
00:10:16,480 --> 00:10:18,740
is bluer

270
00:10:17,540 --> 00:10:18,740
than the sky

271
00:10:18,740 --> 00:10:21,480
What the hell are you saying!

272
00:10:21,480 --> 00:10:25,140
After reading his lines over and over, he's trying hard to remember.

273
00:10:23,810 --> 00:10:25,180
What are you trying to say?

274
00:10:25,680 --> 00:10:28,940
In his brain, all the pages are now messed up.

275
00:10:28,940 --> 00:10:29,610
Let's go then.

276
00:10:29,610 --> 00:10:33,210
As soon as you get in, the "No-laughing" rule is in effect.

277
00:10:32,780 --> 00:10:34,180
Here it comes!

278
00:10:34,280 --> 00:10:34,980
OK!

279
00:10:37,240 --> 00:10:39,840
Talking here won't speed things up.

280
00:10:38,980 --> 00:10:39,740
Yeah.

281
00:10:39,840 --> 00:10:40,740
I'll go first.

282
00:10:40,710 --> 00:10:43,180
This time, I am not going to laugh at all.

283
00:10:47,440 --> 00:10:49,480
NOTE

284
00:10:51,110 --> 00:10:53,040
That's... dangerous!

285
00:10:53,040 --> 00:10:55,380
You can't laugh from here, once you step on.

286
00:10:55,310 --> 00:10:59,740
Employees Already On The Bus

287
00:10:55,380 --> 00:10:56,440
I saw something.

288
00:10:57,110 --> 00:10:57,910
Where?

289
00:10:57,910 --> 00:10:59,310
Hamada-san has something great.

290
00:10:59,440 --> 00:11:00,010
What?

291
00:11:00,740 --> 00:11:04,010
I'm not going to say it now.

292
00:11:01,580 --> 00:11:04,010
But he has something great.

293
00:11:06,410 --> 00:11:09,180
He's keeping Hamada's secret.

294
00:11:10,540 --> 00:11:14,140
The bus departs for the training school.

295
00:11:14,140 --> 00:11:17,540
What is in store for them?

296
00:11:18,710 --> 00:11:21,110
Please check Hamada carefully.

297
00:11:21,110 --> 00:11:23,980
Even now, he kind of looks like he's laughing.

298
00:11:24,010 --> 00:11:25,640
Oh, yeah, he is.

299
00:11:25,680 --> 00:11:26,680
Kind of.

300
00:11:26,680 --> 00:11:28,140
I'm not!

301
00:11:28,140 --> 00:11:30,210
It's because he said that!

302
00:11:31,040 --> 00:11:32,910
Well, I really hope everything will be OK.

303
00:11:33,880 --> 00:11:38,010
In the bus filled with tension, they are not allowed to laugh.

304
00:11:38,710 --> 00:11:43,180
Alas, it won't be easy on them.

305
00:11:48,910 --> 00:11:51,680
Arrival At A Bus Stop

306
00:11:51,340 --> 00:11:52,240
So soon.

307
00:11:52,510 --> 00:11:54,040
Yes, so soon.

308
00:11:54,210 --> 00:11:57,040
I'm trying not to look at what is getting on.

309
00:11:57,140 --> 00:11:58,710
OK! I made it.

310
00:11:59,310 --> 00:12:01,210
Was this the first trap?

311
00:12:01,540 --> 00:12:05,740
Banana Man

312
00:12:01,540 --> 00:12:05,740
Shitara Osamu

313
00:12:02,510 --> 00:12:05,740
Banana Man

314
00:12:02,510 --> 00:12:05,740
Himura Yuuki

315
00:12:09,480 --> 00:12:14,710
Ito Ichiro

316
00:12:10,440 --> 00:12:12,410
Is this the first trap?

317
00:12:20,640 --> 00:12:21,980
It's Matsumoto-san's fault!

318
00:12:21,980 --> 00:12:22,580
Why?

319
00:12:22,580 --> 00:12:25,840
You keep saying it!  "Currr"

320
00:12:26,680 --> 00:12:28,240
His "Curr" is dangerous.

321
00:12:27,740 --> 00:12:28,640
No no no..

322
00:12:30,610 --> 00:12:32,680
It's starting now!

323
00:12:32,210 --> 00:12:37,280
4th rule

324
00:12:32,210 --> 00:12:37,280
Black army issues the punishments

325
00:12:34,510 --> 00:12:36,080
What're you doing?

326
00:12:36,080 --> 00:12:37,780
Zaki-san, was the first victim.

327
00:12:37,640 --> 00:12:40,010
Hey, you know what?

328
00:12:40,010 --> 00:12:43,910
Lately, I've been thinking, I like idols and actors but

329
00:12:44,010 --> 00:12:45,610
don't you just love comedians?

330
00:12:45,610 --> 00:12:46,440
Yes!

331
00:12:46,480 --> 00:12:50,740
They are so funny and so cool now.

332
00:12:46,940 --> 00:12:52,710
Comedian Groupie Trio

333
00:12:50,740 --> 00:12:52,980
Comedians are becoming popular.

334
00:12:52,980 --> 00:12:54,110
They're so cool.

335
00:12:54,110 --> 00:12:55,240
Who do you like?

336
00:12:55,240 --> 00:12:56,440
Hmm..

337
00:12:56,440 --> 00:12:57,110
Kokado?

338
00:12:57,340 --> 00:12:58,180
Kokado?

339
00:12:58,240 --> 00:12:59,540
Kokado of Rocchi.

340
00:12:59,540 --> 00:13:01,280
He's too plain.

341
00:13:01,280 --> 00:13:02,240
That's why I like him!

342
00:13:02,240 --> 00:13:03,810
What about Ichiko?

343
00:13:03,810 --> 00:13:06,780
For me...

344
00:13:05,040 --> 00:13:05,740
Who do you like?

345
00:13:06,740 --> 00:13:07,540
Ichiko?

346
00:13:07,840 --> 00:13:08,880
Takeshi-san.

347
00:13:09,440 --> 00:13:10,980
Oh Takeshi-san!

348
00:13:12,810 --> 00:13:14,240
He's too quiet!

349
00:13:16,640 --> 00:13:20,380
Please don't do that... could you speak up?

350
00:13:22,840 --> 00:13:24,240
Why say Takeshi-san..

351
00:13:26,040 --> 00:13:27,140
What is it?

352
00:13:28,340 --> 00:13:30,210
They are so rough!

353
00:13:30,680 --> 00:13:32,780
I like him too.

354
00:13:32,540 --> 00:13:34,880
Takeshi-san is cool.

355
00:13:34,910 --> 00:13:36,780
But after all everyone likes Downtown.

356
00:13:36,780 --> 00:13:37,640
Downtown?

357
00:13:37,340 --> 00:13:39,240
I agree.

358
00:13:38,180 --> 00:13:39,210
Downtown..

359
00:13:39,580 --> 00:13:40,740
Too soft.

360
00:13:40,440 --> 00:13:42,710
After all they are the top.

361
00:13:42,710 --> 00:13:45,010
What is Downtown after all?

362
00:13:45,010 --> 00:13:47,310
I thought about why they are so funny.

363
00:13:47,310 --> 00:13:49,110
Did you?
- Yes.

364
00:13:49,610 --> 00:13:53,780
Then I thought,

365
00:13:50,580 --> 00:13:53,780
it's the Kansai dialect that they speak.

366
00:13:53,310 --> 00:13:54,180
Many speak it.

367
00:13:54,180 --> 00:13:55,680
He was pissing me off.

368
00:13:55,640 --> 00:13:58,640
It's not that Downtown is funny.   It's their Kansai dialect.

369
00:14:05,010 --> 00:14:07,840
You said it before!

370
00:14:07,340 --> 00:14:15,380
Comedian groupie's opinion

371
00:14:07,340 --> 00:14:15,380
Kansai dialect is making Downtown funny

372
00:14:11,340 --> 00:14:14,740
We're hit in this packed bus.

373
00:14:15,510 --> 00:14:17,040
Yeah, it was dangerous sitting there

374
00:14:17,380 --> 00:14:19,840
By the way, I saw this on TV.

375
00:14:20,240 --> 00:14:22,180
Do you know Gekidan-Hitori's Nakigei?

376
00:14:22,210 --> 00:14:23,680
Yes.
- Yeah?

377
00:14:23,680 --> 00:14:25,310
He can control his tears.

378
00:14:25,310 --> 00:14:26,740
But that is..

379
00:14:26,740 --> 00:14:28,280
I think we can do it too.

380
00:14:28,280 --> 00:14:31,140
We just have to cry while saying something, huh?

381
00:14:29,610 --> 00:14:37,080
Anyone can do Gekidan-hitori's Nakigei

382

Comedian groupie's opinion

383
00:14:31,140 --> 00:14:32,340
Don't you think so, Ichiko?

384
00:14:32,340 --> 00:14:34,140
Don't you think we can do it?

385
00:14:34,140 --> 00:14:35,410
You just have to cry.

386
00:14:35,610 --> 00:14:37,380
You should try, Ichiko!

387
00:14:37,540 --> 00:14:41,580
How can I do it?

388
00:14:49,940 --> 00:14:52,140
I can't remember

389
00:14:52,040 --> 00:14:53,410
You can't... remember?

390
00:14:54,210 --> 00:14:55,780
What?

391
00:14:58,910 --> 00:14:59,980
I don't get it.

392
00:15:00,140 --> 00:15:01,680
What are you saying?

393
00:15:01,680 --> 00:15:02,840
Sad story?

394
00:15:02,740 --> 00:15:05,580
Did someone

395
00:15:04,140 --> 00:15:05,580
mention something?

396
00:15:05,910 --> 00:15:08,380
To make you cry?

397
00:15:15,110 --> 00:15:16,440
What do you mean you can't remember?

398
00:15:16,540 --> 00:15:17,910
It's difficult.

399
00:15:17,910 --> 00:15:19,510
Gekidan-hitori is awesome.

400
00:15:19,510 --> 00:15:20,880
He's awesome after all.

401
00:15:20,980 --> 00:15:23,580
Oh, I remember.

402
00:15:23,680 --> 00:15:27,340
On batsu games that comedians do on TV,

403
00:15:27,340 --> 00:15:27,740
Um.

404
00:15:27,740 --> 00:15:28,640
Kuwagata Beetle.

405
00:15:29,510 --> 00:15:30,380
Kuwagata Beetle?
-Kuwagata Beetle?

406
00:15:30,380 --> 00:15:32,810
You often see them bitten by beetles.
- Yes.

407
00:15:32,810 --> 00:15:35,240
As Degawa said somewhere...

408
00:15:35,240 --> 00:15:36,740
It doesn't hurt that much.

409
00:15:36,780 --> 00:15:38,340
I read it in a magazine or something.

410
00:15:38,340 --> 00:15:39,010
Wanna try?

411
00:15:38,810 --> 00:15:46,810
Comedian groupie's opinion

412
00:15:38,810 --> 00:15:46,810
It doesn't hurt to be bitten by a beetle as seen on TV.

413
00:15:39,010 --> 00:15:39,440
Yes.

414
00:15:39,740 --> 00:15:40,680
Let's do it.

415
00:15:40,680 --> 00:15:41,540
I have something good here.

416
00:15:42,240 --> 00:15:42,840
Here.

417
00:15:43,080 --> 00:15:44,040
These.

418
00:15:45,510 --> 00:15:46,740
Lottery?

419
00:15:46,740 --> 00:15:47,410
Good idea.

420
00:15:48,140 --> 00:15:49,540
Today, I have it here.

421
00:15:51,980 --> 00:15:53,040
Look.

422
00:15:56,110 --> 00:15:57,780
Is it alive?

423
00:15:56,940 --> 00:15:58,940
Yes, it is.

424
00:16:00,310 --> 00:16:05,810
Japan Hirata Kuwagata Beetle

425
00:16:01,710 --> 00:16:02,510
This.

426
00:16:04,180 --> 00:16:05,480
Do you want to try?
- Yes.

427
00:16:09,740 --> 00:16:10,940
They're scared.

428
00:16:12,340 --> 00:16:12,940
This..

429
00:16:14,040 --> 00:16:15,310
Let's do it on "Here we go."

430
00:16:16,210 --> 00:16:17,440
Here we go!

431
00:16:17,940 --> 00:16:22,940
Ichiko won

432
00:16:19,640 --> 00:16:20,380
Ichiko.

433
00:16:20,380 --> 00:16:22,480
Great.

434
00:16:23,140 --> 00:16:25,240
Oh it's alive!

435
00:16:23,880 --> 00:16:25,210
Yes it is.

436
00:16:25,210 --> 00:16:26,840
Of course it is.

437
00:16:26,840 --> 00:16:28,140
Keep still.

438
00:16:28,280 --> 00:16:29,980
It has a smell.

439
00:16:33,380 --> 00:16:34,380
OUCH!!

440
00:16:34,380 --> 00:16:37,840
REALLY!

441
00:16:35,440 --> 00:16:37,840
REALLY

442
00:16:35,910 --> 00:16:37,840
HURTS!

443
00:16:47,310 --> 00:16:48,910
It's stuck!

444
00:16:48,910 --> 00:16:49,580
It's stuck!

445
00:16:49,580 --> 00:16:53,580
Kuwagata Beetle Doesn't Release Him

446
00:16:57,280 --> 00:16:59,440
There's a hole!

447
00:17:01,810 --> 00:17:03,340
It's bleeding!

448
00:17:03,780 --> 00:17:04,740
Scary!

449
00:17:05,780 --> 00:17:09,740
Now I'm crying... really crying...

450
00:17:08,340 --> 00:17:09,880
It left a hole..

451
00:17:10,410 --> 00:17:11,880
Now he's crying.

452
00:17:11,810 --> 00:17:12,680
There's a hole!

453
00:17:12,680 --> 00:17:14,240
This is not supposed to happen..

454
00:17:14,240 --> 00:17:15,280
Wait..

455
00:17:16,880 --> 00:17:19,440
He should've just cried earlier.

456
00:17:22,080 --> 00:17:23,510
Ugh..There's a hole.

457
00:17:24,910 --> 00:17:26,510
That's enough!

458
00:17:26,710 --> 00:17:28,040
I hate it!

459
00:17:28,080 --> 00:17:29,610
Wait Himuko!  Wait!

460
00:17:28,710 --> 00:17:33,210
Himuko Got Scared and Ran Away

461
00:17:31,280 --> 00:17:32,180
Himuko!

462
00:17:37,880 --> 00:17:39,880
I did not laugh!

463
00:17:41,880 --> 00:17:43,010
Why Hamada..

464
00:17:43,110 --> 00:17:46,980
It's not fair that I get involved with his weird laugh...

465
00:17:47,680 --> 00:17:49,080
My laugh is not weird.

466
00:17:50,110 --> 00:17:52,480
You laugh as if I'm also laughing.

467
00:17:52,680 --> 00:17:54,710
Like you're urging me to laugh.

468
00:17:57,740 --> 00:17:59,740
I didn't do that.

469
00:18:00,110 --> 00:18:03,310
It must have hurt, Ito-kun..

470
00:18:03,780 --> 00:18:10,410
30 mins since the start of duty

471
00:18:05,140 --> 00:18:09,940
Well, Hamada got away with a couple of laughs.

472
00:18:09,940 --> 00:18:11,010
Are you sure?

473
00:18:10,980 --> 00:18:13,180
No, I didn't.

474
00:18:11,010 --> 00:18:13,980
I heard him making noise.

475
00:18:13,980 --> 00:18:16,380
I didn't say that.

476
00:18:17,080 --> 00:18:18,510
No, it was Yama-chan.

477
00:18:18,640 --> 00:18:20,010
You just did it again.

478
00:18:20,410 --> 00:18:22,880
You were laughing while saying "No."

479
00:18:26,210 --> 00:18:28,810
He just made a funny face!

480
00:18:27,010 --> 00:18:28,810
He just made a funny face!

481
00:18:29,040 --> 00:18:30,740
He just made a funny face!

482
00:18:31,980 --> 00:18:33,640
Hamada-san just made a funny face!

483
00:18:34,410 --> 00:18:36,810
Let's stop trapping each other

484
00:18:37,010 --> 00:18:38,110
That's dirty!

485
00:18:39,040 --> 00:18:40,080
Give him the hardest hit.

486
00:18:42,210 --> 00:18:43,210
Good one.

487
00:18:43,240 --> 00:18:45,310
Let's not quarrel.

488
00:18:45,310 --> 00:18:46,780
Between friends.

489
00:18:46,780 --> 00:18:48,780
I didn't mean it.

490
00:18:49,180 --> 00:18:50,940
Matsumoto-san's "Gurr."

491
00:18:50,940 --> 00:18:51,840
That's bad, right?

492
00:18:52,210 --> 00:18:53,540
They let it go.

493
00:18:53,540 --> 00:18:55,040
What do you mean?

494
00:18:55,040 --> 00:18:58,340
You were like this all the way through.

495
00:18:57,110 --> 00:18:58,180
Yeah.

496
00:18:59,440 --> 00:19:01,910
The one I've been doing since our debut?

497
00:19:07,910 --> 00:19:09,880
That's enough already.

498
00:19:21,880 --> 00:19:23,280
Quarreling.

499
00:19:23,340 --> 00:19:27,010
That's one of negative spirals caused by repressed emotion.

500
00:19:28,810 --> 00:19:31,580
There is a wall they have to clear.

501
00:19:36,840 --> 00:19:40,140
Stopping At The Next Stop

502
00:19:50,680 --> 00:19:52,380
He got off in the middle of nowhere.

503
00:19:52,400 --> 00:19:53,900
Thief!!

504
00:19:53,900 --> 00:19:55,370
Thief!!

505
00:19:55,410 --> 00:20:00,410
A Property Crime Occurred!

506
00:19:57,540 --> 00:20:00,210
Thief! Thief!

507
00:20:00,210 --> 00:20:00,810
Where?

508
00:20:01,610 --> 00:20:03,410
Underwear thief!

509
00:20:02,210 --> 00:20:03,410

518
00:20:28,180 --> 00:20:29,310
How dirty!

519
00:20:29,310 --> 00:20:31,710
Look at the butts

520
00:20:34,510 --> 00:20:35,780
They're morons.

521
00:20:38,840 --> 00:20:41,410
Long, too long!

522
00:20:50,410 --> 00:20:54,140
These guys..

523
00:20:51,910 --> 00:20:54,140
can't be helped.

524
00:20:54,610 --> 00:20:57,880
Barbie-chan had lot of cellulite.

525
00:21:03,440 --> 00:21:05,310
They are still at it.

526
00:21:07,710 --> 00:21:09,610
They are still going.

527
00:21:09,110 --> 00:21:09,610
Really?

528
00:21:10,380 --> 00:21:11,640
So slow.

529
00:21:11,610 --> 00:21:14,940
So full of stamina,huh.

530
00:21:19,410 --> 00:21:24,240
I don't care but he laughed when I said "Full of stamina."

531
00:21:25,280 --> 00:21:26,110
Yes, he did.

532
00:21:26,110 --> 00:21:27,310
Yes, I think so.

533
00:21:31,000 --> 00:21:34,670
I'll ban you from putting your hands around your mouth.

534
00:21:46,280 --> 00:21:47,040
Damn you!

535
00:21:49,250 --> 00:21:51,150
What's with your face!

536
00:21:51,240 --> 00:21:52,740
Downtown's self-destruction.

537
00:21:52,740 --> 00:21:55,240
They're STILL going!

538
00:21:55,310 --> 00:21:56,480
Catch him already.

539
00:21:56,480 --> 00:21:57,880
That is really something.

540
00:21:57,880 --> 00:22:01,110
Why do they keep their distance!

541
00:22:01,680 --> 00:22:03,010
Just catch him

542
00:22:08,340 --> 00:22:11,210
I really thought that they were going to board the bus.

543
00:22:10,910 --> 00:22:11,240
Yeah.

544
00:22:12,510 --> 00:22:13,580
They're still at it.

545
00:22:14,010 --> 00:22:14,740
Look.

546
00:22:15,580 --> 00:22:16,140
Look.

547
00:22:16,880 --> 00:22:18,040
Yeah.

548
00:22:19,710 --> 00:22:21,580
They look so happy that it got stolen.

549
00:22:21,580 --> 00:22:22,440
Yeah.

550
00:22:24,410 --> 00:22:26,740
It's been 45 mins since the start of the bus ride.

551
00:22:27,040 --> 00:22:29,910
The rash of punishments never stop!

552
00:22:31,380 --> 00:22:35,740
After this, even stronger assassins await them!

553
00:22:40,480 --> 00:22:41,440

Hey wait, Shingo.

557
00:22:53,710 --> 00:22:55,340
What? What's wrong with you, Yuriko-chan?

558
00:22:55,710 --> 00:22:56,310
Huh?

559
00:22:56,310 --> 00:22:59,040
You cheated on me again, right?

No no no!

00:23:02,640 --> 00:23:05,840
That was just a little party!

567
00:23:05,840 --> 00:23:07,510
Don't make a sad face.

568
00:23:07,510 --> 00:23:08,680
But..

569
00:23:08,680 --> 00:23:09,310
Why?

570
00:23:09,780 --> 00:23:14,210
Umezawa Tomio

571
00:23:09,780 --> 00:23:14,210
Yuriko's Father

572
00:23:09,840 --> 00:23:10,480
Yuriko.

573
00:23:12,480 --> 00:23:13,080
Dad.

574
00:23:13,080 --> 00:23:14,040
What's going on?

575
00:23:14,040 --> 00:23:14,480
Huh?

576
00:23:14,940 --> 00:23:15,780
Who is this man?

577
00:23:17,110 --> 00:23:17,880
Oh, hi.

578
00:23:18,280 --> 00:23:20,180
It's me!

579
00:23:20,610 --> 00:23:22,410
Who the hell are you!

580
00:23:22,880 --> 00:23:27,640
* They laughed, but please keep watching.

581
00:23:26,480 --> 00:23:27,580
He stays cool.

582
00:23:28,510 --> 00:23:29,340
You're crying.

583
00:23:29,340 --> 00:23:30,040
I'm not crying.

584
00:23:30,480 --> 00:23:31,810
What did you do? Huh?

585
00:23:31,810 --> 00:23:32,410
I didn't..

586
00:23:32,410 --> 00:23:33,580
What did you do to my daughter?

587
00:23:34,280 --> 00:23:37,640
What? You noisy old bastard!

588
00:23:37,640 --> 00:23:42,510
Playboy Being Rude To His Girlfriend's Father

589
00:23:38,080 --> 00:23:39,680
What are you doing?

590
00:23:40,980 --> 00:23:41,910
Shingo!

591
00:23:41,910 --> 00:23:43,180
What are you doing?

592
00:23:44,110 --> 00:23:45,310
Stop it!

593
00:23:45,310 --> 00:23:46,380
What? I'm telling you.

594
00:23:46,580 --> 00:23:48,840
Yuriko-chan and I are getting along very well.

595
00:23:49,380 --> 00:23:51,280
I can do whatever I want to do to her.

597
00:23:53,910 --> 00:23:55,140
Ouch! It hurts..

598
00:23:55,440 --> 00:23:57,280
You look just like your dad.  Let him see your face.

599
00:23:57,480 --> 00:23:58,080
Stop it.

600
00:23:58,540 --> 00:23:59,140
Stop it.

601
00:23:59,140 --> 00:23:59,980
It hurts!

602
00:24:00,810 --> 00:24:01,640
I said to stop it!

603
00:24:01,640 --> 00:24:03,880
What! Shut up, old bastard!

604
00:24:05,280 --> 00:24:06,080
Stop it.

605
00:24:06,080 --> 00:24:08,980
Isn't it "Stop it, PLEASE."?

606
00:24:09,280 --> 00:24:10,210
Say it.

607
00:24:10,240 --> 00:24:10,880
What..

608
00:24:10,880 --> 00:24:12,040
Say "Stop it, please."

609
00:24:12,040 --> 00:24:12,780
What are you doing?

610
00:24:12,840 --> 00:24:16,580
Watch your mouth!

611
00:24:13,680 --> 00:24:16,580
Damn you!!

612
00:24:18,210 --> 00:24:19,010
Hey.

613
00:24:20,380 --> 00:24:21,740
What did you just do?

614
00:24:22,640 --> 00:24:23,280
Huh?

615
00:24:24,110 --> 00:24:25,540
Did you just kick me?

616
00:24:27,110 --> 00:24:28,680
Was it in the script?

617
00:24:30,180 --> 00:24:30,640
Hey.

618
00:24:30,980 --> 00:24:32,040
Stop the camera.

619
00:24:33,680 --> 00:24:34,680
I said to stop it!

620
00:24:37,310 --> 00:24:38,910
I'm sorry, Hama-chan.

621
00:24:38,410 --> 00:24:38,910
It's OK.

622
00:24:38,940 --> 00:24:40,110
I'm sorry, Macchan.

623
00:24:40,880 --> 00:24:42,180
Even if this is variety,

624
00:24:42,980 --> 00:24:44,680
there is a line you shouldn't cross.

625
00:24:45,510 --> 00:24:45,940
Yes.

626
00:24:45,940 --> 00:24:47,010
I can't stand it.

627
00:24:48,010 --> 00:24:48,980
I'm sorry.

628
00:24:48,980 --> 00:24:49,580
I'm so sorry.

629
00:24:49,580 --> 00:24:51,180
Why did you kick me?

630
00:24:51,680 --> 00:24:52,180
Hey.

631
00:24:53,010 --> 00:24:54,380
It wasn't in the script!

632
00:24:54,640 --> 00:24:55,180
Sorry.

633
00:24:55,980 --> 00:24:57,210
Give me a break.

634
00:24:57,380 --> 00:24:58,280
I'm sorry.

635
00:24:58,780 --> 00:24:59,780
Did you make him do it?

636
00:25:00,780 --> 00:25:01,240
Hey.

637
00:25:01,410 --> 00:25:01,810
No..

638
00:25:02,280 --> 00:25:03,810
I can't talk to you.

639
00:25:04,610 --> 00:25:05,610
Call the Producer.

640
00:25:06,210 --> 00:25:07,610
Call the Producer!

641
00:25:08,740 --> 00:25:09,840
I can't continue this.

642
00:25:10,410 --> 00:25:11,240
I'm sorry.

643
00:25:24,110 --> 00:25:25,580
WOW!!

644
00:25:25,580 --> 00:25:29,680
Happy Boy

Okada Keisuke (Masuda Okada)

646
00:25:29,080 --> 00:25:30,010
Here I come!

647
00:25:30,410 --> 00:25:32,880
Thank you very much.

648
00:25:33,340 --> 00:25:34,040
Awesome.

649
00:25:34,040 --> 00:25:35,640
Good to see you, but..

650
00:25:35,610 --> 00:25:36,680
Hey!

651
00:25:37,080 --> 00:25:39,980
Stop the quarreling, Tomio-chan!

652
00:25:40,340 --> 00:25:42,940
This is all Dokkiri (prank).

653
00:25:43,340 --> 00:25:45,610
My comedy is disappointing.

654
00:25:46,510 --> 00:25:48,640
Stupid!!

655
00:25:50,540 --> 00:25:54,110
This play is all fake.

656
00:25:54,110 --> 00:25:58,010
My plays are always meaningless.

657
00:26:12,140 --> 00:26:14,180
It surprised me!

658
00:26:14,210 --> 00:26:16,940
It's too much of a collaboration!

659
00:26:18,680 --> 00:26:20,640
I was really frightened.

660
00:26:21,880 --> 00:26:23,180
Give me a break.

661
00:26:23,180 --> 00:26:24,540
Wow.

662
00:26:24,540 --> 00:26:25,410
I'm so sorry, Hama-can.

663
00:26:25,640 --> 00:26:26,540
Let us do it again.

664
00:26:26,610 --> 00:26:27,140
OK?

665
00:26:27,280 --> 00:26:28,210
We will be fine this time.

666
00:26:28,610 --> 00:26:32,680
Re-doing The Play

667
00:26:29,980 --> 00:26:31,080
I'm sorry, Macchan.

668
00:26:31,080 --> 00:26:32,280
Do it properly, OK?

669
00:26:31,080 --> 00:26:32,280
Doing it again.

670
00:26:33,510 --> 00:26:34,680
Huh?

671
00:26:35,110 --> 00:26:36,040
It was a prank right?

672
00:26:36,380 --> 00:26:39,710
Wasn't it just a prank?

673
00:26:37,710 --> 00:26:39,710
Isn't it done?

674
00:26:39,740 --> 00:26:41,410
Where..from..

675
00:26:40,380 --> 00:26:41,410
Huh?

676
00:26:40,680 --> 00:26:42,880
Hey Shingo, wait.

677
00:26:42,880 --> 00:26:45,640
What's wrong with you, Yuriko-chan?

678
00:26:46,080 --> 00:26:47,640
Here she says "you cheated on me."

679
00:26:47,640 --> 00:26:49,680
You cheated on me again, huh?

680
00:26:49,680 --> 00:26:52,910
You shouldn't call it cheating.  No no no!

683
00:26:57,410 --> 00:26:59,940
What's going on?

684
00:26:59,210 --> 00:27:01,040
Are we watching this again?

685
00:27:03,240 --> 00:27:04,440
Who's this man?

686
00:27:04,880 --> 00:27:06,940
Hey it's me!

687
00:27:07,080 --> 00:27:08,280
Who the hell are you!

688
00:27:09,640 --> 00:27:16,110
* They already laughed, but please keep watching.

689
00:27:10,240 --> 00:27:11,840
We already saw this

690
00:27:15,910 --> 00:27:16,780
I'm not crying.

691
00:27:16,780 --> 00:27:17,680
What did you do!?

692
00:27:17,680 --> 00:27:20,280
Huh? What did you do to my daughter!?

693
00:27:20,280 --> 00:27:23,380
Yuriko and I get along well.  Do you want to see?

694
00:27:23,680 --> 00:27:25,340
She is totally fine with it.

695
00:27:25,340 --> 00:27:26,380
It hurts!

Shut up, stupid.

704
00:27:34,980 --> 00:27:37,380
Starting from here

705
00:27:36,480 --> 00:27:38,940
Shut up, you're annoying!

706
00:27:38,940 --> 00:27:39,680
Stop it.

707
00:27:40,080 --> 00:27:41,010
You're noisy.

708
00:27:40,880 --> 00:27:43,080
Here it comes!

709
00:27:40,880 --> 00:27:43,080
There it is.

710
00:27:45,180 --> 00:27:47,440
What did you just do?

711
00:27:47,440 --> 00:27:49,180
No more already!

712
00:27:49,180 --> 00:27:50,310
You already did it!

713
00:27:52,440 --> 00:27:53,980
You just did it!

714
00:27:54,610 --> 00:27:56,340
It was exactly the same.

715
00:27:59,240 --> 00:28:00,810
Stop the camera.

716
00:28:01,240 --> 00:28:02,510
I said to stop it!

717
00:28:03,240 --> 00:28:05,380
Well, we can't react the same

718
00:28:05,440 --> 00:28:06,380
I'm sorry, Hama-chan.

719
00:28:06,980 --> 00:28:08,180
I'm really sorry, Macchan.

720
00:28:10,940 --> 00:28:12,540
I can't talk to you.

721
00:28:12,940 --> 00:28:14,010

This is ruleless Dokkiri take 2!

726
00:28:34,940 --> 00:28:36,810
Hi, Yoshitaka-chan!

727
00:28:36,810 --> 00:28:39,380
You came here for a little promotion, Yoshitaka-chan.

728
00:28:39,510 --> 00:28:41,840
But ended up showing your ugly faces!

729
00:28:41,980 --> 00:28:43,980
I'm easing it for you!

730
00:28:44,310 --> 00:28:45,810
No!!

731
00:28:45,910 --> 00:28:47,740
I see! Thank you very much.

732
00:28:51,010 --> 00:28:53,180
Why did he say "I see"?

733
00:28:52,710 --> 00:28:55,080
Here is a question for you, Yoshitaka-chan.

734
00:28:55,080 --> 00:28:56,610
What's in here?

735
00:28:56,610 --> 00:28:59,140
Tada!

736
00:28:59,140 --> 00:29:01,640
Here's Robo-ji!

737
00:29:01,640 --> 00:29:03,940
The role she's playing this time is,

738
00:29:03,940 --> 00:29:06,680
a geeky girl student who loves robot.

739
00:29:06,880 --> 00:29:07,780
This is Robo-ji,

740
00:29:08,110 --> 00:29:10,980
what I get during this season is.. Kireiji (bleeding piles)!

741
00:29:11,210 --> 00:29:13,080
No!!

742
00:29:13,080 --> 00:29:13,910
You Iboji (hemorrhoid)!

743
00:29:16,010 --> 00:29:16,510
Wow!!

"Robo-ji"

747
00:29:22,210 --> 00:29:23,240
It's an advertisement.

748
00:29:26,340 --> 00:29:29,240
Here we go, come on everybody!

749
00:29:34,440 --> 00:29:36,210
It's the first time for us to be used for promotion...

750
00:29:36,210 --> 00:29:37,180
What the hell is this!

751
00:29:37,070 --> 00:29:38,600
How dare they do a promo.

752
00:29:38,480 --> 00:29:41,380
Tomio! You better cut it out.

753
00:29:47,210 --> 00:29:48,040
There was a moment..

754
00:29:48,040 --> 00:29:48,880
Yeah.

755
00:29:48,880 --> 00:29:50,880
It was just a moment..

756
00:29:56,340 --> 00:30:00,210
He didn't say he was Happy boy.

757
00:30:01,280 --> 00:30:06,810
It's been an hour from the start. The hell commute still continues.

758
00:30:08,770 --> 00:30:11,050
I wonder how we will get off.

759
00:30:27,000 --> 00:30:28,710
This was tough.

760
00:30:28,770 --> 00:30:32,270
Koyabu Kazutoyo

761
00:30:28,770 --> 00:30:32,270
Manager

762
00:30:29,960 --> 00:30:32,730
How's your song  about Hiyashi-chuka coming along?

763
00:30:33,090 --> 00:30:35,340
It's not very good.

764
00:30:35,340 --> 00:30:36,610
Oh yeah?

765
00:30:36,610 --> 00:30:38,570
Fads come and go quickly.

766
00:30:38,580 --> 00:30:40,780
You might have to make a new one.

767
00:30:40,780 --> 00:30:44,310
Actually, I'm thinking to form a duo.

768
00:30:44,310 --> 00:30:44,960
Duo?

769
00:30:44,980 --> 00:30:45,680
Yes.

770
00:30:45,080 --> 00:30:45,840
Sounds good.

771
00:30:46,080 --> 00:30:48,940
Actually, my partner is here today.

772
00:30:48,940 --> 00:30:50,880
Is your partner here?  Let me see him.

773
00:30:50,880 --> 00:30:55,340
It's just.. I'm kind of worried if it will turn out OK.

774
00:30:54,040 --> 00:30:55,380
Is that so..

775
00:30:55,340 --> 00:30:57,210
Hey, partner!

776
00:30:58,390 --> 00:30:59,330
Come here!

777
00:31:02,780 --> 00:31:08,140
(Umemiya Tatsuo)

778
00:31:02,780 --> 00:31:08,140
Partner

779
00:31:08,980 --> 00:31:12,310
Isn't he too old?

780
00:31:12,310 --> 00:31:16,010
He's got deep wrinkles next to his mouth.

781
00:31:15,140 --> 00:31:15,780
Hey!

782
00:31:16,450 --> 00:31:17,440
It's crazy to say that.

783
00:31:16,850 --> 00:31:18,630
It's rolling into his face.

784
00:31:21,130 --> 00:31:22,420
He's rude.

785
00:31:26,940 --> 00:31:28,580
Never mind about his wrinkles..

786
00:31:33,050 --> 00:31:35,190
Hey Koyabu..

787
00:31:36,610 --> 00:31:38,640
Are you sure you'll be OK with this old man?

788
00:31:38,840 --> 00:31:42,010
I'm sure. We can get along.

789
00:31:42,550 --> 00:31:46,480
Be that as it may, do you have a new performance?

790
00:31:44,620 --> 00:31:45,320
Yes.

791
00:31:45,890 --> 00:31:46,480
OK Then.

792
00:31:46,880 --> 00:31:48,680
I'm Amemiya

793
00:31:48,680 --> 00:31:50,510
I'm Umemiya

794
00:31:50,880 --> 00:31:52,610
Please listen to this.

795
00:31:55,640 --> 00:32:01,710
"While I was attending college, I was scouted one night in Ginza"

796
00:32:01,710 --> 00:32:04,810
"I became an actor at Toei.."

797
00:32:07,440 --> 00:32:13,240
AMEMIYA Suddenly Laughs

798
00:32:07,540 --> 00:32:09,310
What was he doing?

799
00:32:15,420 --> 00:32:16,740
This is no good!

800
00:32:16,740 --> 00:32:17,440
Yes.

801
00:32:17,440 --> 00:32:18,680
He's not supposed to laugh.

802
00:32:19,210 --> 00:32:20,760
Give me a break!

803
00:32:22,280 --> 00:32:25,120
I was not counted!

804
00:32:27,080 --> 00:32:31,480
This always happens.  I'm not supposed to be hit but they make me stand.

805
00:32:31,480 --> 00:32:32,710
Are you OK?

806
00:32:32,740 --> 00:32:33,640
I'm OK.

807
00:32:33,880 --> 00:32:35,680
Yes, Umemiya is OK too.

808
00:32:35,680 --> 00:32:36,910
Huh?

809
00:32:37,210 --> 00:32:39,110
Never mind.  Continue.

810
00:32:45,480 --> 00:32:51,080
"While I was attending college, I was scouted one night in Ginza"

811
00:32:51,080 --> 00:32:55,010
"I became.."

812
00:33:00,430 --> 00:33:01,210
What's wrong?

813
00:33:01,210 --> 00:33:05,440
AMEMIYA Did It Again

814
00:33:03,790 --> 00:33:05,110
What's wrong with him?

815
00:33:05,380 --> 00:33:06,740
This is wrong!

816
00:33:08,470 --> 00:33:10,120
Damn you!

817
00:33:10,130 --> 00:33:12,230
This isn't good.

818
00:33:12,280 --> 00:33:13,220
This is not good.

819
00:33:13,040 --> 00:33:16,080
This is creating a bad atmosphere.

820
00:33:16,110 --> 00:33:18,380
"When I was.."

821
00:33:19,110 --> 00:33:20,980
Thank you, Umemiya.

822
00:33:20,980 --> 00:33:22,180
You can do it

823
00:33:22,180 --> 00:33:23,510
Huh?

824
00:33:22,750 --> 00:33:24,040
I can do it.

825
00:33:24,380 --> 00:33:26,040
You don't need to say "Huh?"

826
00:33:26,040 --> 00:33:27,610
Koyabu, cut it out.

827
00:33:27,040 --> 00:33:28,080
Stop the "Huh?"

828
00:33:28,640 --> 00:33:30,740
Gather yourself, Amemiya.

829
00:33:32,040 --> 00:33:33,680
OK!

830
00:33:33,680 --> 00:33:35,240
Finish it!

831
00:33:37,580 --> 00:33:38,440
Here we go

832
00:33:39,380 --> 00:33:41,540
"When I was.."

833
00:33:42,980 --> 00:33:43,510
Amemiya...

834
00:33:44,140 --> 00:33:45,280
Amemiya will sing.

835
00:33:46,610 --> 00:33:48,740
Shall I slap you once?

836
00:33:49,310 --> 00:33:52,040
It seems it would be better if I slap you once.

837
00:33:52,210 --> 00:33:54,080
Pull yourself together. Think about the audience.

838
00:33:54,650 --> 00:33:55,570
I'm really sorry.

839
00:33:55,580 --> 00:33:56,810
As a pro...

840
00:34:00,060 --> 00:34:01,050
He was fine.

841
00:34:01,760 --> 00:34:02,860
He was doing fine.

842
00:34:04,210 --> 00:34:06,210
He was pretty good!

843
00:34:07,920 --> 00:34:09,070
It was a hard one.

844
00:34:08,540 --> 00:34:11,280
I'm sorry to bother you when you are busy.

845
00:34:12,080 --> 00:34:13,880
Koyabu is scary.

846
00:34:13,910 --> 00:34:15,090
He's trying hard.

847
00:34:20,810 --> 00:34:21,540
OK!

848
00:34:21,710 --> 00:34:23,340
OK!

849
00:34:22,180 --> 00:34:23,340
OK!

850
00:34:23,810 --> 00:34:24,840
This is your last chance!

851
00:34:24,840 --> 00:34:26,310
This is your last chance!

852
00:34:26,310 --> 00:34:27,710
You have to make them laugh!

853
00:34:27,710 --> 00:34:31,210
Why are YOU laughing?

854
00:34:29,510 --> 00:34:30,280
That's true.

855
00:34:30,280 --> 00:34:31,210
Just pull yourself together.

856
00:34:32,540 --> 00:34:33,610
OK.  Again!

857
00:34:43,510 --> 00:34:49,010
"While I was attending college, I was scouted one night in Ginza"

858
00:34:49,010 --> 00:34:56,040
"I became an actor at Toei. Then the following year"

859
00:34:56,380 --> 00:35:02,180
"I became a star, got carried away and started to regularly visit Ginza"

860
00:35:02,640 --> 00:35:08,080
"I was called Emperor of night"

861
00:35:08,580 --> 00:35:15,610
"The woman who brought me back down to earth"

862
00:35:15,780 --> 00:35:20,110
"It was Claudia with blue eyes"

863
00:35:19,100 --> 00:35:20,130
Wait.

864
00:35:20,110 --> 00:35:22,880
Your voice is too soft, don't try so sing well!

865
00:35:29,420 --> 00:35:30,220
Koyabu..

866
00:35:31,180 --> 00:35:32,480
He didn't have to say that.

867
00:35:40,210 --> 00:35:41,110
Sing loud!

868
00:35:41,440 --> 00:35:44,240
On stage, you'll only have a foot mic.

869
00:35:43,180 --> 00:35:44,210
Yes.

870
00:35:44,410 --> 00:35:46,910
OK from, "It was Claudia with blue eyes."

871
00:35:47,410 --> 00:35:50,210
Sing it loud. All of your parts. OK?

872
00:35:50,210 --> 00:35:50,650
Yes.

873
00:35:50,480 --> 00:35:51,540
OK, let's start!

874
00:35:56,040 --> 00:35:59,810
"IT WAS CLAUDIA WITH BLUE EYES!!"

875
00:35:59,820 --> 00:36:00,530
Good.

876
00:36:01,340 --> 00:36:07,940
"I got bored acting so I got involved in cooking"

877
00:36:08,240 --> 00:36:13,940
"I started making Tacchan Pickles"

878
00:36:14,080 --> 00:36:20,440
"Matsukata goes deep-sea fishing often and got a suntan before I knew it"

879
00:36:20,640 --> 00:36:25,910
"He finally caught a giant tuna"

880
00:36:26,340 --> 00:36:32,040
"Anna came back home and suddenly my hair went white"

881
00:36:32,510 --> 00:36:38,680
"Although I look young I became 73 years old this year"

882
00:36:38,980 --> 00:36:45,740
"Stress piles up and body odor gets worse as I age"

883
00:36:46,180 --> 00:36:51,110
"I started using eau de cologne"

884
00:36:51,380 --> 00:36:57,540
"Every time I kiss my grandchild, she cries out"

885
00:36:57,880 --> 00:37:04,840
"Why is my tear falling even if I am not sad?"

886
00:37:05,440 --> 00:37:11,240
"I started breath care"

887
00:37:11,710 --> 00:37:18,510
"Breath care..."

888
00:37:15,240 --> 00:37:18,510
"Breath care..."

889
00:37:18,810 --> 00:37:23,880
"I started breath care"

890
00:37:23,040 --> 00:37:24,040
What's he doing.

891
00:37:24,180 --> 00:37:25,580
No need for that!

892
00:37:26,250 --> 00:37:27,420
No need for it.

893
00:37:32,210 --> 00:37:34,610
The manager is so strict.

894
00:37:33,610 --> 00:37:35,410
The manager is strict.

895
00:37:42,110 --> 00:37:43,580
Something...

896
00:37:43,810 --> 00:37:46,200
Hmm..Amemiya is fine.

897
00:37:46,200 --> 00:37:46,820
Yes.

898
00:37:47,070 --> 00:37:48,860
You are a bit..

899
00:37:48,860 --> 00:37:50,950
Wrong. Like the tone of your voice..

900
00:37:50,950 --> 00:37:52,340
It's not funny.

901
00:37:52,580 --> 00:37:54,480
It's rather sad to watch you sing.

902
00:37:55,310 --> 00:37:59,240
An old man is trying to sing.

903
00:37:59,240 --> 00:38:00,910
You got a bad mouth!

904
00:38:01,750 --> 00:38:02,690
Bad mouth.

905
00:38:02,270 --> 00:38:03,490
Hey you!

906
00:38:03,480 --> 00:38:05,140
Don't say that!

907
00:38:05,580 --> 00:38:08,480
Such a bad mouth!

908
00:38:13,710 --> 00:38:14,480
He's bad.

909
00:38:14,480 --> 00:38:17,410
Yes, he is so strict.

910
00:38:17,550 --> 00:38:19,900
What do you think, Amemiya. Can you get along with him?

911
00:38:19,900 --> 00:38:21,690
I think we can.

912
00:38:21,690 --> 00:38:22,890
What about you?

913
00:38:22,940 --> 00:38:26,610
I THINK WE CAN!

914
00:38:25,310 --> 00:38:26,510
Keep up the good voice!

915
00:38:26,740 --> 00:38:28,110
YES!

916
00:38:27,480 --> 00:38:28,110
YES!

917
00:38:28,110 --> 00:38:29,580
GOT IT?

918
00:38:28,880 --> 00:38:29,580
YES!

919
00:38:29,810 --> 00:38:32,540
FOUL BREATH (Koushuu)!

920
00:38:31,180 --> 00:38:32,540
What is traffic (Koutsuu)?

921
00:38:34,010 --> 00:38:35,240
Foul breath!

922
00:38:39,580 --> 00:38:40,970
Traffic!

923
00:38:41,340 --> 00:38:43,310
You were just singing about it.

924
00:38:43,310 --> 00:38:45,880
What the hell!

925
00:38:47,080 --> 00:38:48,020
I don't want it!

926
00:38:50,000 --> 00:38:51,430
Not traffic.

927
00:38:53,430 --> 00:38:54,560
OK then.

928
00:38:54,910 --> 00:38:56,280
I understand how hard you are trying.

929
00:38:56,280 --> 00:38:58,960
Let's go back to the office and make a new song!

930
00:38:59,310 --> 00:39:00,280
Shall we go then?

931
00:38:59,690 --> 00:39:00,370
OK.

932
00:39:00,280 --> 00:39:00,890
OK!

933
00:39:11,780 --> 00:39:13,440
What's with Amemiya?

934
00:39:13,580 --> 00:39:17,280
He just couldn't help but laugh, huh?

935
00:39:16,780 --> 00:39:18,780
Koyabu hit them

936
00:39:18,580 --> 00:39:20,480
It surprised me.

937
00:39:18,780 --> 00:39:21,010
I wasn't looking

938
00:39:21,060 --> 00:39:24,360
He did it to Tatsu-ni too.

939
00:39:24,360 --> 00:39:25,300
Scary. Scary.

940
00:39:26,210 --> 00:39:29,110
The long bus commute is almost reaching the end.

941
00:39:29,540 --> 00:39:33,180
They are approaching the GAS training school.

942
00:39:33,940 --> 00:39:39,110

Don't you feel sorry for him?

1091
00:48:00,140 --> 00:48:02,780
It doesn't make sense.

1093
00:48:02,920 --> 00:48:04,120

1101
00:48:21,080 --> 00:48:26,380
I think she is great at applying makeup...

1102
00:48:28,180 --> 00:48:29,780
She says to come here.

1103
00:48:29,780 --> 00:48:30,850
Does she?

1104
00:48:33,110 --> 00:48:35,210
It was that scary.

1105
00:48:35,220 --> 00:48:37,220
This is scary, huh?

1106
00:48:37,240 --> 00:48:39,240
He was summoned and got OUT.

1107
00:48:41,140 --> 00:48:43,080
Full force!

1108
00:48:44,080 --> 00:48:45,040
And I had to go.

1109
00:48:45,040 --> 00:48:45,910
Yeah.

1110
00:48:46,080 --> 00:48:47,710
Sorry for you.

00:48:48,210 --> 00:48:54,040
She Treats Her Love To A Marshmallow

1112
00:48:57,840 --> 00:48:59,710
Marshmallow?

1113
00:49:12,280 --> 00:49:13,040
What's this?

1114
00:49:13,040 --> 00:49:13,740
What?

1115
00:49:19,380 --> 00:49:21,810
I don't know what I'm supposed to do.

1116
00:49:22,180 --> 00:49:23,280
What?

1117
00:49:25,080 --> 00:49:28,640
She is saying to come closer and open your mouth wider.

1118
00:49:39,880 --> 00:49:41,020
It is very scary.

1119
00:49:43,180 --> 00:49:44,410
En... Endo!

1120
00:49:44,660 --> 00:49:45,060
Yes.

1121
00:49:45,610 --> 00:49:46,640
She says to come here.

1122
00:49:46,480 --> 00:49:48,110
It wasn't even his turn, right?

1123
00:49:48,110 --> 00:49:52,480
I guess Endo is just loved

1124
00:49:50,010 --> 00:49:52,480
regardless of the rules?

1125
00:49:53,400 --> 00:49:54,400
OK, excuse me.

1126
00:49:54,400 --> 00:49:55,570

00:50:08,280 --> 00:50:08,880
Yes.

1133
00:50:11,110 --> 00:50:12,480
Thank you.

1134
00:50:14,510 --> 00:50:21,540
Deluxe CA's

1135
00:50:14,510 --> 00:50:21,540
Private Time

1136
00:50:32,910 --> 00:50:35,680
Too tough

1137
00:50:34,610 --> 00:50:36,980
It was really happening.
She was actually doing it.

1138
00:50:41,210 --> 00:50:42,980
Why was I the only one out?

1139
00:50:44,080 --> 00:50:45,980
It's hard to believe.

1140
00:51:01,440 --> 00:51:03,480
Your face changed.

1141
00:51:03,940 --> 00:51:05,560
Please leave, Fujiwara-san!

1142
00:51:05,590 --> 00:51:06,460
Thank you.

1143
00:51:06,460 --> 00:51:07,120
Thank you.

1144
00:51:07,120 --> 00:51:08,150
Thank you.

1145
00:51:10,980 --> 00:51:11,940
Excuse us.

1146
00:51:15,110 --> 00:51:17,440
I want to wipe my face

1147
00:51:19,110 --> 00:51:21,710
It seems like she loves you all.

1148
00:51:21,910 --> 00:51:24,310
I don't really think so

1149
00:51:24,310 --> 00:51:26,510
We're going to be OK?

1150
00:51:25,790 --> 00:51:26,630
Good.

1151
00:51:29,360 --> 00:51:36,030
Matsumoto's private SP Waiting At Stairs

1152
00:51:29,760 --> 00:51:30,510
f

1153
00:51:29,990 --> 00:51:30,490
Wow.

1154
00:51:31,760 --> 00:51:33,170
We are going up stairs. This way.

1155
00:51:33,310 --> 00:51:33,900
OK.

1156
00:51:33,310 --> 00:51:33,900
OK.

1157
00:51:34,890 --> 00:51:36,020
Thank you for your work.

1158
00:51:36,210 --> 00:51:39,110
This alone makes me laugh

1159
00:51:42,140 --> 00:51:44,910
This wasn't as comfortable
as you may think.

1160
00:51:42,510 --> 00:51:43,980
I'm trying not to see it

1161
00:51:43,980 --> 00:51:46,440
I can't stand this

1162
00:51:44,910 --> 00:51:46,510
I guess so.

1163
00:51:47,640 --> 00:51:49,780
It was so rough. That deep kiss.

1164
00:51:50,680 --> 00:51:52,140
I wanted to see it.

1165
00:51:52,140 --> 00:51:54,180
Did she do it hard?

1166
00:51:54,510 --> 00:51:58,680
She was seriously

1167
00:51:55,010 --> 00:51:59,880
3rd Floor

1168
00:51:55,610 --> 00:51:58,610
putting her tongue in

1169
00:51:57,110 --> 00:51:57,540
Sure?

1170
00:51:57,550 --> 00:51:58,690
Yes, she did.

1171
00:51:59,270 --> 00:52:00,140
Thank you.

1172
00:52:03,010 --> 00:52:04,020
Thank you.

1173
00:52:08,180 --> 00:52:11,410
You will be standing by in this newbie training room.

1174
00:52:11,080 --> 00:52:11,950
OK.

1175
00:52:11,940 --> 00:52:12,940
Please enter.

1176
00:52:15,040 --> 00:52:20,610
Newbie Training Room

1177
00:52:19,080 --> 00:52:23,080
Your seats are assigned by your names.  Please sit in the correct seats.

1178
00:52:22,410 --> 00:52:23,210
Yes.

1179
00:52:23,210 --> 00:52:24,580
Finally.

1180
00:52:24,540 --> 00:52:28,640
1 Hour 50 Minutes Since Starting

1181
00:52:24,580 --> 00:52:26,150
It was a long way to come.

1182
00:52:26,150 --> 00:52:27,020
Yes.

1183
00:52:27,420 --> 00:52:28,320
It was..

1184
00:52:28,310 --> 00:52:30,140
This place is not free of punishments.

1185
00:52:31,040 --> 00:52:32,940
But yet.

1186
00:52:32,980 --> 00:52:34,680
We could rest here a little.

1187
00:52:34,680 --> 00:52:38,080
Now we are going to learn about cabin atten..dants..

1188
00:52:38,080 --> 00:52:39,410
Here are training books.

1189
00:52:39,410 --> 00:52:41,510
Please read it well.

1190
00:52:41,030 --> 00:52:41,390
Yes.

1191
00:52:41,510 --> 00:52:46,840
Handing Out CA Books

1192
00:52:41,600 --> 00:52:42,270
Endo.

1193
00:52:42,270 --> 00:52:43,070
Yes.

1194
00:52:44,730 --> 00:52:45,340
Hamada.

1195
00:52:45,340 --> 00:52:46,040
Yes.

1196
00:52:48,960 --> 00:52:50,130
This is for Matsumoto.

1197
00:52:52,610 --> 00:52:55,250
CA books are handed out by Fujiwara.

1198
00:52:55,240 --> 00:52:58,380
Of course, these are traps to make them laugh...

1199
00:52:58,640 --> 00:52:59,510
Hamada

1200
00:52:58,640 --> 00:52:59,510
Masatoshi

1201
00:52:59,310 --> 00:53:04,040
ID photo for just Hamada is a mountain gorilla.

1202
00:53:05,190 --> 00:53:06,560
Let's see what happens..

1203
00:53:07,440 --> 00:53:09,750
OK then, please stand by here for a while.

1204
00:53:09,740 --> 00:53:10,880
Can we look inside?

1205
00:53:10,890 --> 00:53:12,930
Yes, please read it well.

1206
00:53:12,930 --> 00:53:13,760
OK.

1207
00:53:15,680 --> 00:53:16,880
Just a regular photo..

1208
00:53:18,340 --> 00:53:28,780
ID Photo

1209
00:53:27,480 --> 00:53:29,510
You are quick.

1210
00:53:29,510 --> 00:53:30,750
Instant death.

1211
00:53:30,750 --> 00:53:32,280
What's so funny about this?

1212
00:53:32,240 --> 00:53:33,940
Instant death!

1213
00:53:33,150 --> 00:53:34,020
By what?

1214
00:53:34,010 --> 00:53:37,210
You stand by too easily to be hit on the butt.

1215
00:53:40,520 --> 00:53:42,560
What made you laugh?

1216
00:53:42,540 --> 00:53:44,680
The ID photo?

1217
00:53:43,760 --> 00:53:45,260
Yes, here is.

1218
00:53:47,710 --> 00:53:49,580
No thanks, I have mine here.

1219
00:53:50,080 --> 00:53:52,740
Just take a look at mine.

1220
00:53:50,380 --> 00:53:52,540
That's right.  It's true

1221
00:53:53,180 --> 00:53:57,410
No, I have mine here. I saw mine already. See?

1222
00:53:57,870 --> 00:54:08,050
ID Photo

1223
00:53:59,380 --> 00:54:01,380
Why are you laughing?

1224
00:54:00,380 --> 00:54:01,780
Shut up and look mine.

1225
00:54:01,380 --> 00:54:04,010
Why are you laughing?

1226
00:54:02,840 --> 00:54:04,040
I'm not laughing.

1227
00:54:04,820 --> 00:54:06,150
Sure you did.

1228
00:54:06,450 --> 00:54:08,850
He was for quite a while.

1229
00:54:09,640 --> 00:54:11,540
If you are curious why I was laughing, look to see why.

1230
00:54:11,550 --> 00:54:12,590
Here is a big one.

1231
00:54:14,740 --> 00:54:16,740
What are you doing?

1232
00:54:22,680 --> 00:54:24,240
What?

1233
00:54:24,240 --> 00:54:25,580
If you ask me why I was laughing..

1234
00:54:25,580 --> 00:54:27,080
Endo will.

1235
00:54:27,110 --> 00:54:27,810
Endo, take a look.

1236
00:54:30,810 --> 00:54:39,350
Hamada Masatoshi

1237
00:54:48,060 --> 00:54:50,530
But I guess so.

1238
00:54:50,530 --> 00:54:51,830
It can't be helped.

1239
00:54:51,830 --> 00:54:52,730
I think so too.

1240
00:55:03,480 --> 00:55:04,480
Didn't he laugh just now?

1241
00:55:05,080 --> 00:55:07,240
I thought you did.

1242
00:55:06,780 --> 00:55:08,310
I think he did.

1243
00:55:08,310 --> 00:55:09,180
No no no.

1244
00:55:11,130 --> 00:55:11,430
Right?

1245
00:55:12,730 --> 00:55:13,250
See?

1246
00:55:13,540 --> 00:55:16,180
That isn't laughing, right?

1247
00:55:16,180 --> 00:55:16,880
He's laughing!

1248
00:55:16,180 --> 00:55:16,880
He's laughing!

1249
00:55:24,710 --> 00:55:27,540
No, that's not it.  I read another page.

1250
00:55:27,930 --> 00:55:31,970
The more pages you read, the more traps you'll find.

1251
00:55:28,240 --> 00:55:37,280
* The secret story of Downtown when they debuted as "The Wright brothers" is written in tribute to the skies.

1252
00:55:32,940 --> 00:55:34,840
Oh I didn't know that.

1253
00:55:34,410 --> 00:55:35,740
It was there.

1254
00:55:39,480 --> 00:55:44,680
Hamada Masatoshi

1255
00:55:44,480 --> 00:55:45,980
What the hell is that!

1256
00:55:51,050 --> 00:55:52,290
This is enough.

1257
00:55:55,060 --> 00:55:56,590
Even such a thing is written.

1258
00:55:56,610 --> 00:55:58,230
It doesn't make sense!

1259
00:55:58,230 --> 00:56:00,230
Give me a break..

1260
00:56:03,660 --> 00:56:04,340
This is mine.

1261
00:56:08,540 --> 00:56:10,610
I think it is malicious.

1262
00:56:10,620 --> 00:56:11,730
It is, right?

1263
00:56:11,710 --> 00:56:12,480
Yes, it is.

1264
00:56:12,210 --> 00:56:14,840
It is a lack of a sense of equality.

1265
00:56:18,720 --> 00:56:26,190
Hamada Masatoshi

1266
00:56:25,090 --> 00:56:26,520
It is not fair.

1267
00:56:26,390 --> 00:56:27,360
No, it's not.

1268
00:56:27,340 --> 00:56:29,040
Can't help laughing.

1269
00:56:29,060 --> 00:56:30,530
Are they in their right mind?

1270
00:56:30,530 --> 00:56:33,130
This is tough.

1271
00:56:36,080 --> 00:56:38,310
Good job, Hamada-san!

1272
00:56:40,000 --> 00:56:41,170
Good pace.

1273
00:56:40,530 --> 00:56:41,190
Yes.

1274
00:56:42,040 --> 00:56:47,040
It was a critical hit. Good one.

1275
00:56:44,510 --> 00:56:47,010
Don't you mean technical hit?

1276
00:56:49,710 --> 00:56:52,340
What is a critical hit?

1277
00:56:52,570 --> 00:56:54,520
I didn't laugh!

1278
00:56:54,430 --> 00:56:56,950
I don't want to be with this stupid!

1279
00:56:56,790 --> 00:56:58,390
Did I laugh?

1280
00:56:57,180 --> 00:57:05,280
A hit that gives greater damage than usual during fighting. This term is mainly used in computer games.

1281
00:56:59,060 --> 00:57:02,330
This moron is killing me.

1282
00:57:05,460 --> 00:57:07,560
This moron is killing me.

1283
00:57:09,570 --> 00:57:11,400
It's been 2 hours since the start.

1284
00:57:11,770 --> 00:57:16,040
They have been just tossed around with traps.

1285
00:57:17,340 --> 00:57:22,980
Furthermore the scary drawers are waiting for them!

1286
00:57:23,880 --> 00:57:27,150
A lot of traps even before entering the room.

1287
00:57:27,150 --> 00:57:28,020
Right.

1288
00:57:28,140 --> 00:57:32,210
I think we rode on the bus for about a couple of hours.

1289
00:57:32,240 --> 00:57:35,840
Endo's scene was much longer too. The Matsuko's..

1290
00:57:34,340 --> 00:57:41,940
Matsuko Deluxe

1291
00:57:35,840 --> 00:57:37,840
The kiss, right?

1292
00:57:36,530 --> 00:57:37,590
The kiss!

1293
00:57:38,230 --> 00:57:39,200
It was LONG!

1294
00:57:39,180 --> 00:57:42,410
She actually used her tongue like hell.

1295
00:57:42,410 --> 00:57:43,680
There was a prank too.

1296
00:57:43,680 --> 00:57:45,580
Yes, there was a prank.

1297
00:57:44,110 --> 00:57:54,140
Umezawa Tomio

1298
00:57:45,870 --> 00:57:46,970
What did you think?

1299
00:57:46,980 --> 00:57:49,510
I really thought wow..

1300
00:57:49,510 --> 00:57:54,140
But if it was true and we laughed, he would've been pissed right?

1301
00:57:53,410 --> 00:57:54,680
Yeah.

1302
00:57:54,680 --> 00:57:59,840
Just in case I had to keep a straight face.

1303
00:57:58,250 --> 00:57:59,420
Were you making that face?

1304
00:58:01,910 --> 00:58:03,680
It's been 2 hours since the start of their duty.

1305
00:58:04,240 --> 00:58:06,740
It is about the time to face it...

1306
00:58:13,380 --> 00:58:16,840
Let's open the drawers, everyone.

1307
00:58:15,480 --> 00:58:16,840
Shall we?

1308
00:58:18,200 --> 00:58:19,270
Here it comes!

1309
00:58:19,070 --> 00:58:21,200
Can't be helped.

1310
00:58:21,500 --> 00:58:22,710
Let's do it.

1311
00:58:22,710 --> 00:58:27,980
Usually I'm first up.  What about this time?  Will you go first, Housei-san?

1312
00:58:26,440 --> 00:58:27,980
Shall I?

1313
00:58:27,980 --> 00:58:32,910
First Up Is Yamazaki

1314
00:58:28,140 --> 00:58:28,780
I'm going.

1315
00:58:29,010 --> 00:58:32,910
Are you sure?  I don't think we have to do it...

1316
00:58:33,400 --> 00:58:34,950
We have to do it soon or later...

1317
00:58:37,280 --> 00:58:39,000
We have to do it soon or later...

1318
00:58:44,940 --> 00:58:50,210
Automated Pop-out Drawer

1319
00:58:45,700 --> 00:58:47,040
Wow!

1320
00:58:47,630 --> 00:58:49,720
This is why I don't want to do it.

1321
00:58:52,040 --> 00:58:53,080
Did it fly out?

1322
00:58:53,470 --> 00:58:54,300
Did you open it?

1323
00:58:54,510 --> 00:58:56,380
Yes, just a little bit and it shot out.

1324
00:58:57,080 --> 00:58:59,440
Like a jack-in-the-box.

1325
00:58:58,810 --> 00:58:59,610
Yes..

1326
00:59:05,710 --> 00:59:06,840
You were laughing

1327
00:59:06,840 --> 00:59:08,240
I didn't laugh

1328
00:59:08,240 --> 00:59:11,480
You did.  That's why this person is here.

1329
00:59:13,580 --> 00:59:15,810
See?  You got hit.

1330
00:59:15,810 --> 00:59:17,440
Because you laughed.

1331
00:59:16,960 --> 00:59:18,760
It happened because you laughed.

1332
00:59:18,760 --> 00:59:21,160
You don't have to say it.

1333
00:59:21,160 --> 00:59:24,100
But I didn't notice it.

1334
00:59:24,120 --> 00:59:27,390
It's dangerous. This is heavy.

1335
00:59:28,840 --> 00:59:31,940
I'll open them all

1336
00:59:32,310 --> 00:59:33,510
I'm scared.

1337
00:59:36,010 --> 00:59:37,780
Nothing

1338
00:59:40,040 --> 00:59:41,640
What?

1339
00:59:41,640 --> 00:59:43,140
There's something

1340
00:59:45,710 --> 00:59:47,290
I heard air.

1341
00:59:52,040 --> 01:00:00,000
Suga Kenji Doll

1342
01:00:02,310 --> 01:00:05,780
I often see Suga-san like this at golf courses.

1343
01:00:03,240 --> 01:00:13,310
Suga Kenji Doll

1344
01:00:05,140 --> 01:00:06,780
It's so dark, I couldn't tell.

1345
01:00:06,280 --> 01:00:07,980
This is Suga-san at a golf course.

1346
01:00:17,140 --> 01:00:18,080
I instantly got it.

1347
01:00:18,080 --> 01:00:20,480
This is Suga-san at a golf course in summer.

1348
01:00:21,180 --> 01:00:24,440
I guess this is about the right color shade.

1349
01:00:25,310 --> 01:00:27,410
Gasu finally became a doll.

1350
01:00:27,410 --> 01:00:31,510
This is..

1351
01:00:28,240 --> 01:00:30,810
Wow.  Suga doll.

1352
01:00:31,510 --> 01:00:32,640
What was it?

1353
01:00:32,780 --> 01:00:34,140
It just exploded

1354
01:00:34,140 --> 01:00:34,840
Yes.

1355
01:00:35,110 --> 01:00:36,840
It exploded, huh?

1356
01:00:37,080 --> 01:00:40,980
It was air-actuated

1357
01:00:38,240 --> 01:00:39,440
Yeah, it was air.

1358
01:00:40,110 --> 01:00:40,980
So that's it

1359
01:00:41,080 --> 01:00:44,180
I think it was supposed to be a bigger explosion.

1360
01:00:43,110 --> 01:00:44,480
It's scary!

1361
01:00:44,180 --> 01:00:46,440
You could've lost your front teeth.

1362
01:00:46,840 --> 01:00:48,540
You're right. Like this..

1363
01:00:49,910 --> 01:00:50,610
Did they target my front teeth?

1364
01:00:50,610 --> 01:00:53,510
Yes, all of them.

1365
01:01:03,310 --> 01:01:06,710
What is it?  I can't sit still.

1366
01:01:06,710 --> 01:01:08,210
Tanaka laughed too.

1367
01:01:10,680 --> 01:01:12,580
I want this relay to stop.

1368
01:01:22,080 --> 01:01:25,080
I have fracture on my leg.  They don't seem to understand it.

1369
01:01:25,840 --> 01:01:27,080
They don't care.

1370
01:01:27,210 --> 01:01:28,710
They don't care.

1371
01:01:30,180 --> 01:01:33,710
Why are you laughing anyway?  You are OUT in two ways.

1372
01:01:35,140 --> 01:01:38,010
You laughed at your senior having a fracture on his leg..

1373
01:01:38,440 --> 01:01:40,610
No, I'm not laughing.

1374
01:01:46,180 --> 01:01:48,980
What's with your face?

1375
01:01:47,540 --> 01:01:48,510
What is it?

1376
01:01:48,980 --> 01:01:50,540
This is not allowed either, right?

1377
01:01:50,940 --> 01:01:53,940
If it is allowed, I would do the same.

1378
01:02:06,880 --> 01:02:08,210
Let's pull ourselves together.
- Yes.

1379
01:02:08,210 --> 01:02:11,880
It is OK even if we get no punishment from now on.

1380
01:02:10,580 --> 01:02:11,740
You're right.

1381
01:02:12,510 --> 01:02:15,040
Please open it already.

1382
01:02:15,040 --> 01:02:16,740
Huh? Matsumoto-san, are you opening your drawer?

1383
01:02:17,410 --> 01:02:18,640
I will go with Haruo

1384
01:02:26,180 --> 01:02:32,410
Automated Pop-out Drawer

1385
01:02:29,910 --> 01:02:30,680
All of them?

1386
01:02:30,680 --> 01:02:31,440
Must be.

1387
01:02:32,640 --> 01:02:34,310
What happened just now?

1388
01:02:34,310 --> 01:02:37,080
As soon as I opened a little, it flew out.

1389
01:02:35,810 --> 01:02:37,810
Yes yes, so that's air.

1390
01:02:38,580 --> 01:02:39,580
It's a pump

1391
01:02:39,780 --> 01:02:41,780
Wait... try opening the first one.

1392
01:02:44,740 --> 01:02:46,610
Oh there is something.

1393
01:02:46,610 --> 01:02:48,610
Art student #1

1394
01:02:48,610 --> 01:02:59,780
Mysterious Envelopes!

1395
01:02:50,740 --> 01:02:52,940
Does it mean this is Art student #2?

1396
01:02:53,780 --> 01:02:54,480
No..

1397
01:02:54,640 --> 01:02:55,780
Wrong.

1398
01:02:55,810 --> 01:02:57,840
There are many.. Umezu-san too.

1399
01:02:57,840 --> 01:02:59,240
Man Gataro.

1400
01:03:00,380 --> 01:03:02,940
Shall we take a look inside?

1401
01:03:01,780 --> 01:03:03,540
Mysterious.

1402
01:03:03,540 --> 01:03:04,440
The 3rd one..

1403
01:03:04,440 --> 01:03:06,710
Let's open that drawer first.

1404
01:03:06,910 --> 01:03:08,380
Drawer?
- Drawer?

1405
01:03:08,640 --> 01:03:10,010
Very mysterious.

1406
01:03:11,280 --> 01:03:27,140
Baby Toys

1407
01:03:12,280 --> 01:03:13,010
What's this?

1408
01:03:13,010 --> 01:03:13,810
What is this?

1409
01:03:30,410 --> 01:03:32,780
Is this a play house kit?

1410
01:03:34,140 --> 01:03:38,580
I mean..I see these almost everyday.

1411
01:03:38,340 --> 01:03:45,240
(Actual toys)

1412
01:03:38,340 --> 01:03:45,240
Matsumoto's daughter's

1413
01:03:38,580 --> 01:03:41,210
She plays with these, huh?

1414
01:03:42,240 --> 01:03:43,740
It's a toy!

1415
01:03:43,740 --> 01:03:44,810
Is this really yours?

1416
01:03:45,340 --> 01:03:47,380
So it was meant to get you.

1417
01:03:48,340 --> 01:03:49,810
Nothing here

1418
01:03:50,180 --> 01:03:52,010
Shall we take a look at these?

1419
01:03:52,010 --> 01:03:54,040
Art student #1

1420
01:03:54,180 --> 01:03:55,280
I'm scared.

1421
01:03:59,610 --> 01:04:11,040
by Art student

1422
01:04:13,280 --> 01:04:14,580
What's this?

1423
01:04:17,610 --> 01:04:20,840
Oh, that's it!  I got it now!

1424
01:04:19,610 --> 01:04:20,980
I got it.  I got it.

1425
01:04:20,980 --> 01:04:21,740
Oh, that's it.

1426
01:04:24,480 --> 01:04:28,980
This is a Hamada-san's composite drawing by an art student.

1427
01:04:25,910 --> 01:04:27,410
That's what it is.

1428
01:04:31,180 --> 01:04:32,680
Hey you.

1429
01:04:38,180 --> 01:04:39,240
He must be stupid.

1430
01:04:40,310 --> 01:04:41,640
Don't relax so much.

1431
01:04:41,810 --> 01:04:43,310
That wasn't good of me.

1432
01:04:46,310 --> 01:04:48,210
He was really enjoying it.

1433
01:04:48,210 --> 01:04:50,740
Street artist.

1434
01:04:52,010 --> 01:05:04,310
by Street artist

1435
01:04:58,880 --> 01:05:00,240
This is awesome.

1436
01:05:02,940 --> 01:05:04,540
Hey Hamada-san!

1437
01:05:04,540 --> 01:05:06,540
This is no good!

1438
01:05:09,210 --> 01:05:12,080
As I kind of knew, I think Hamada is easy to draw.

1439
01:05:12,080 --> 01:05:13,440
It really looks like him!

1440
01:05:13,440 --> 01:05:16,080
It really does.

1441
01:05:17,810 --> 01:05:19,480
It does.

1442
01:05:19,540 --> 01:05:21,780
Are we going to look at them all at once?  I guess so huh..

1443
01:05:22,710 --> 01:05:23,940
We have to.

1444
01:05:24,010 --> 01:05:26,810
What about Umezu-san's.

1445
01:05:26,440 --> 01:05:27,840
He is good.

1446
01:05:27,680 --> 01:05:29,480
Oh, there are two.

1447
01:05:29,540 --> 01:05:30,640
First one.

1448
01:05:31,240 --> 01:05:44,140
Umezu Kazuo #1

1449
01:05:48,880 --> 01:05:51,280
I knew it, it is awesome.

1450
01:05:51,280 --> 01:05:51,980
A real pro.

1451
01:05:53,110 --> 01:05:54,340
What did you mean there were two.

1452
01:05:54,240 --> 01:05:56,010
There is 1 more.

1453
01:05:58,210 --> 01:06:11,140
Umezu Kazuo #2

1454
01:06:07,840 --> 01:06:11,080
I tried hard not to laugh!

1455
01:06:11,180 --> 01:06:12,340
Isn't it awesome?

1456
01:06:12,340 --> 01:06:13,110
It is.

1457
01:06:14,540 --> 01:06:18,810
This is gonna be a hard one for me.  Man Gataro.

1458
01:06:15,910 --> 01:06:18,810
Man Gataro

1459
01:06:19,440 --> 01:06:29,780
Awarded the 1st GAG KING prize on the Weekly Shonen Jump.  His outstanding works are "Chinyuki" and "Jigoku-Koshien" etc.

1460
01:06:19,440 --> 01:06:29,780
Man Gataro

1461
01:06:20,910 --> 01:06:22,640
He's awesome too.

1462
01:06:23,940 --> 01:06:27,110
Gataro drew so many!

1463
01:06:28,540 --> 01:06:30,040
Oh is he the one with the "touch?"

1464
01:06:31,280 --> 01:06:42,810
Man Gataro #1

1465
01:06:31,280 --> 01:06:42,810
Written: Natsumi
(Hamada's wife)

1466
01:06:43,180 --> 01:06:44,740
I thought I could bare it!

1467
01:06:45,440 --> 01:06:47,710
This is great.

1468
01:06:48,080 --> 01:06:50,680
Yes, it is.

1469
01:06:51,340 --> 01:06:52,680
His power as a painter..

1470
01:06:53,680 --> 01:06:56,340
So many different Hamada-sans..

1471
01:06:56,340 --> 01:06:57,580
The 2nd one.

1472
01:06:58,310 --> 01:07:05,680
("you" written in
Osaka dialect )

1473
01:06:58,310 --> 01:07:05,680
Man Gataro #2

1474
01:06:58,310 --> 01:07:05,680
Written: Natsumi..
You were alive, ware

1475
01:07:06,610 --> 01:07:08,710
What kind of story is that!

1476
01:07:10,110 --> 01:07:12,080
We don't use "ware" (you) in the context.

1477
01:07:13,980 --> 01:07:15,440
We don't use it that way!

1478
01:07:15,510 --> 01:07:17,210
This is not Osaka dialect!

1479
01:07:17,310 --> 01:07:19,040
You were alive... ware.

1480
01:07:23,140 --> 01:07:25,210
Which one do you like, Hamada-san?

1481
01:07:25,510 --> 01:07:27,810
I like the street artist.

1482
01:07:27,680 --> 01:07:32,040
by Street artist

1483
01:07:28,080 --> 01:07:29,510
This one?

1484
01:07:29,510 --> 01:07:32,140
This is really awesome.

1485
01:07:32,280 --> 01:07:33,980
Tanaka, go!

1486
01:07:34,040 --> 01:07:35,240
OK, I'm going!

1487
01:07:45,980 --> 01:07:47,610
Nothing?

1488
01:07:47,710 --> 01:07:49,240
Again

1489
01:07:48,440 --> 01:07:49,740
Again...

1490
01:07:49,310 --> 01:07:50,880
Here it comes!

1491
01:07:50,480 --> 01:07:53,780
Mysterious DVD

1492
01:07:54,310 --> 01:07:55,780
It comes every time.

1493
01:07:55,780 --> 01:07:57,780
I wonder what it is this time?

1494
01:07:58,080 --> 01:08:00,240
So it's the DVD again

1495
01:08:00,240 --> 01:08:01,980
Let's open the rest of drawers.

1496
01:08:01,710 --> 01:08:02,480
Yes.

1497
01:08:02,410 --> 01:08:05,810
Last time, we found more than one DVD.

1498
01:08:05,840 --> 01:08:06,310
Yes.

1499
01:08:08,040 --> 01:08:09,810
Nothing in the top drawer.

1500
01:08:12,780 --> 01:08:14,680
Nothing in the middle.

1501
01:08:16,840 --> 01:08:17,910
What's wrong?

1502
01:08:17,910 --> 01:08:22,280
Nothing.

1503
01:08:18,480 --> 01:08:22,280
What the hell is it.

1504
01:08:18,710 --> 01:08:22,280
Nothing?

1505
01:08:30,440 --> 01:08:32,480
Don't speak in unison with me.

1506
01:08:33,380 --> 01:08:35,040
Tanaka laughed too!

1507
01:08:43,710 --> 01:08:46,280
Why are you wearing that?

1508
01:08:46,510 --> 01:08:51,380
Black... very obscene underwear.

1509
01:09:02,240 --> 01:09:05,640
Very obscene underwear.

1510
01:09:03,480 --> 01:09:05,040
You shouldn't say it.

1511
01:09:05,080 --> 01:09:06,680
I shouldn't?

1512
01:09:08,210 --> 01:09:10,640
Yeah, I didn't have to say it.

1513
01:09:12,480 --> 01:09:14,540
So let's think when to watch that (DVD)?

1514
01:09:14,540 --> 01:09:16,340
Leave it for now?

1515
01:09:16,340 --> 01:09:17,840
Please go, Matsumoto-san.

1516
01:09:17,840 --> 01:09:20,740
I'm scared of the air thing.

1517
01:09:22,310 --> 01:09:23,310
Watch out.

1518
01:09:27,640 --> 01:09:29,510
Nothing in there

1519
01:09:37,510 --> 01:09:39,510
Empty.

1520
01:09:41,640 --> 01:09:44,010
It can't be...

1521
01:09:42,140 --> 01:09:44,010
Nothing.  For the first time?

1522
01:09:45,540 --> 01:09:47,280
Oh my gosh, here it comes!

1523
01:09:47,110 --> 01:09:51,980
Mysterious Button!

1524
01:09:51,310 --> 01:09:52,310
Here it is.

1525
01:09:52,780 --> 01:09:53,710
What is it?

1526
01:09:54,280 --> 01:09:56,210
There might be another one in the lower drawer.

1527
01:09:56,840 --> 01:09:57,740
Nothing?

1528
01:10:00,740 --> 01:10:05,510
5 Mysterious Panels

1529
01:10:01,240 --> 01:10:02,010
Did you find anything?

1530
01:10:02,110 --> 01:10:03,040
There is.

1531
01:10:03,740 --> 01:10:04,440
What's this?

1532
01:10:06,940 --> 01:10:08,810
How can I show these?

1533
01:10:09,440 --> 01:10:10,580
There are 5 of them.

1534
01:10:10,580 --> 01:10:12,080
Just show them one by one.

1535
01:10:12,080 --> 01:10:15,010
Can I rotate it first?

1536
01:10:15,310 --> 01:10:15,840
Wrong?

1537
01:10:17,210 --> 01:10:18,440
I wonder how should I do this.

1538
01:10:19,810 --> 01:10:21,280
Should it be on the top?

1539
01:10:22,010 --> 01:10:36,110
Hamada

1540
01:10:22,010 --> 01:10:36,110
Idol Collage

1541
01:10:29,510 --> 01:10:31,940
Stop with everything being Hamada!

1542
01:10:34,810 --> 01:10:37,480
Stop bringing up only Hamada!

1543
01:10:42,310 --> 01:10:43,380
Wow.

1544
01:10:43,380 --> 01:10:43,940
This is no good.

1545
01:10:45,380 --> 01:10:47,310
No, maybe it's just in order?

1546
01:10:47,310 --> 01:10:51,610
I was on top, the rest might be you guys...

1547
01:10:47,910 --> 01:10:48,910
Oh, I see.

1548
01:10:48,940 --> 01:10:49,940
Yeah.

1549
01:10:51,040 --> 01:10:52,010
Might be.

1550
01:11:00,980 --> 01:11:04,080
After seeing the first one... the next one seemed kinda dull.

1551
01:11:05,380 --> 01:11:06,180
Can't be helped.

1552
01:11:06,180 --> 01:11:12,710
Idol collage

1553
01:11:06,180 --> 01:11:12,710
Tanaka

1554
01:11:15,180 --> 01:11:27,110
Idol Collage

1555
01:11:15,180 --> 01:11:27,110
Yamasaki

1556
01:11:25,880 --> 01:11:27,940
What are you doing?

1557
01:11:28,240 --> 01:11:30,240
Scary.

1558
01:11:31,410 --> 01:11:32,740
Who's body is it?

1559
01:11:33,010 --> 01:11:35,210
Yeah I wonder.

1560
01:11:39,240 --> 01:11:51,580
Idol collage

1561
01:11:39,240 --> 01:11:51,580
Matsumoto

1562
01:11:43,610 --> 01:11:47,340
That's malicious.

1563
01:11:47,940 --> 01:11:50,640
Scary! It scares me!

1564
01:11:51,240 --> 01:11:52,640
It scares me!

1565
01:11:53,610 --> 01:11:55,080
What are you doing?

1566
01:11:59,140 --> 01:12:00,980
This problem still remains.

1567
01:12:00,510 --> 01:12:01,410
Yes.

1568
01:12:01,210 --> 01:12:09,710
Mysterious Button
(Kanji = Dragon)

1569
01:12:02,180 --> 01:12:05,380
What is it?  Dragon?

1570
01:12:05,440 --> 01:12:07,180
Shall we leave it on the side.

1571
01:12:07,410 --> 01:12:09,910
Yeah, since we still have the DVD.

1572
01:12:10,110 --> 01:12:12,110
Endo?  That's wrong.

1573
01:12:10,710 --> 01:12:11,110
Yes.

1574
01:12:14,240 --> 01:12:16,010
What are you doing?

1575
01:12:16,440 --> 01:12:19,210
I'm putting them away.

1576
01:12:22,710 --> 01:12:24,140
Dragon?

1577
01:12:24,280 --> 01:12:26,440
"Dragon" is written on it?

1578
01:12:28,140 --> 01:12:29,410
Try pressing it.

1579
01:12:28,340 --> 01:12:30,780
Huh? Is it the character of the next year?

1580
01:12:30,780 --> 01:12:32,540
The year of the dragon?

1581
01:12:33,540 --> 01:12:35,010
Next year is the year of the dragon

1582
01:12:35,010 --> 01:12:37,310
Oh that must be it!

1583
01:12:37,340 --> 01:12:42,410
In a few hours, it will be the year of the dragon.

1584
01:12:50,440 --> 01:12:52,110
Why me?

1585
01:12:52,110 --> 01:12:54,580
He made a face like a criminal!

1586
01:12:54,840 --> 01:12:56,140
What the hell is it!

1587
01:12:56,140 --> 01:12:57,480
No, I didn't!

1588
01:13:01,210 --> 01:13:02,840
Hey hurry up, Matsumoto-san.

1589
01:13:02,840 --> 01:13:03,810
Sure?

1590
01:13:02,840 --> 01:13:03,810
Yes.

1591
01:13:02,840 --> 01:13:03,810
Yes.

1592
01:13:02,840 --> 01:13:03,810
Yes.

1593
01:13:07,940 --> 01:13:09,310
Here I go

1594
01:13:09,310 --> 01:13:10,210
I don't care what happens

1595
01:13:10,410 --> 01:13:11,280
OK?

1596
01:13:11,480 --> 01:13:12,440
I'm pressing it!

1597
01:13:25,810 --> 01:13:33,240
Pressing Button -> Hakuryu Appears

1598
01:13:27,940 --> 01:13:29,680
Oh!  That's it

1599
01:13:39,210 --> 01:13:40,810
That's Hakuryu.

1600
01:14:08,540 --> 01:14:09,940
Shhhhh

1601
01:14:10,710 --> 01:14:12,810
FART

1602
01:14:19,040 --> 01:14:21,710
Who would imagine this?  It's not like his character.

1603
01:14:21,710 --> 01:14:23,480
What are you making him to do!

1604
01:14:29,340 --> 01:14:31,210
It surprised me!

1605
01:14:31,210 --> 01:14:33,210
Ah!  He's going back.

1606
01:14:34,180 --> 01:14:37,980
Now I got it.  It means Hakuryu (White Dragon).

1607
01:14:37,880 --> 01:14:40,440
"Dragon" on the white button = Hakuryu

1608
01:14:41,110 --> 01:14:43,180
I got it.  It's Hakuryu-san.

1609
01:14:44,910 --> 01:14:46,740
Easing the tension.

1610
01:14:46,740 --> 01:14:48,340
That's right.

1611
01:14:48,980 --> 01:14:52,180
I was scared of what he was going to do.

1612
01:14:52,780 --> 01:14:55,580
In this time of the year before new years..

1613
01:14:55,840 --> 01:15:01,180
who would imagine to hear someone else's fart.

1614
01:15:01,180 --> 01:15:02,540
Someone not too familiar.

1615
01:15:02,540 --> 01:15:03,080
Yeah.

1616
01:15:03,910 --> 01:15:06,510
I wonder just how he did it.?

1617
01:15:06,510 --> 01:15:08,480
Was it a real fart?

1618
01:15:09,480 --> 01:15:11,880
I thought it was...

1619
01:15:12,140 --> 01:15:15,940
It was live... actually live.

1620
01:15:18,910 --> 01:15:20,980
Can he control it?

1621
01:15:20,980 --> 01:15:22,180
If so, it's awesome.

1622
01:15:22,180 --> 01:15:24,180
But it was quite weak.

1623
01:15:25,140 --> 01:15:26,380
It was.

1624
01:15:26,680 --> 01:15:29,340
And he left before we knew it.

1625
01:15:32,140 --> 01:15:35,310
2 hours 30 minutes ago

1626
01:15:32,140 --> 01:15:35,310
CA Duties Started

1627
01:15:32,210 --> 01:15:34,510
One problem follows another.

1628
01:15:34,710 --> 01:15:38,310
One of duties for newbie CA is visiting senior workers.

1629
01:15:35,840 --> 01:15:40,440
Training School 1F

1630
01:15:38,780 --> 01:15:40,310
Everyone, come this way.

1631
01:15:41,280 --> 01:15:46,240
From now on, I'll introduce you to your trainer.

1632
01:15:46,340 --> 01:15:50,140
Your trainer is known to be very strict.  Be careful.

1633
01:15:50,380 --> 01:15:51,440
Let's go in.

1634
01:15:51,710 --> 01:15:52,840
Excuse me.

1635
01:15:51,880 --> 01:15:56,140
CA Training room

1636
01:15:53,940 --> 01:15:55,210
Everyone, come on in.

1637
01:15:57,840 --> 01:16:00,440
Matsumoto, here's a chair for you.

1638
01:16:00,440 --> 01:16:01,840
Oh thank you.

1639
01:16:01,980 --> 01:16:04,510
Yamazaki, Tanaka and Endo in the order.

1640
01:16:09,710 --> 01:16:11,940
Excuse me!  Excuse me!

1641
01:16:12,780 --> 01:16:17,540
CA Trainer Appears

1642
01:16:27,580 --> 01:16:30,410
CA Trainer

1643
01:16:27,580 --> 01:16:30,410
Takahashi Keiko

1644
01:16:31,680 --> 01:16:33,410
Wait!

1645
01:16:33,410 --> 01:16:34,740
Are you serious?

1646
01:16:35,580 --> 01:16:37,410
No kidding!?

1647
01:16:47,540 --> 01:16:52,310
I'm Takahashi Keiko.

1648
01:16:54,310 --> 01:17:01,080
When she was 15, she won the Golden Arrow Award for new faces.

1649
01:17:01,080 --> 01:17:04,140
Even though she is a successful actress,

1650
01:17:04,340 --> 01:17:08,010
she appears on a damn variety show on new year's eve,

1651
01:17:08,380 --> 01:17:12,110
wearing a damn bondage outfit.

1652
01:17:12,840 --> 01:17:15,780
Who the hell is it?

1653
01:17:17,310 --> 01:17:19,040
THAT'S ME!!

1654
01:17:37,410 --> 01:17:41,340
I reviewed your profile information in advance.

1655
01:17:44,880 --> 01:17:46,540
Let's see.

1656
01:17:49,710 --> 01:17:51,710
You must be Endo.

1657
01:17:51,710 --> 01:17:52,510
Yes.

1658
01:17:53,310 --> 01:17:55,610
I heard you have a new girlfriend?

1659
01:17:56,880 --> 01:17:58,240
Are you doing well with her?

1660
01:17:59,410 --> 01:18:02,110
Yes, I think so... Yes!

1661
01:18:02,810 --> 01:18:05,410
Doing well, huh?

1662
01:18:06,740 --> 01:18:11,240
To a girl who was not even his girlfriend yet,

1663
01:18:11,610 --> 01:18:15,740
he sent a brainless text message.

1664
01:18:15,740 --> 01:18:20,710
"I'm going to train you well!"

1665
01:18:20,710 --> 01:18:22,710
Who's the super pervert?

1666
01:18:22,940 --> 01:18:26,740
Who the hell is it?

1667
01:18:27,580 --> 01:18:30,540
THAT'S YOU!!

1668
01:18:34,510 --> 01:18:36,440
It's funny when she says it.

1669
01:18:37,040 --> 01:18:37,980
"That's you!"

1670
01:18:39,640 --> 01:18:41,480
But it's the truth.

1671
01:18:41,480 --> 01:18:42,810
Yes it is.

1672
01:18:47,840 --> 01:18:48,880
Yamazaki.

1673
01:18:49,010 --> 01:18:49,740
Yes.

1674
01:18:50,640 --> 01:18:52,140
I heard you are married?

1675
01:18:52,140 --> 01:18:52,740
Yes.

1676
01:18:53,040 --> 01:18:56,040
Are you taking good care of your wife?

1677
01:18:54,580 --> 01:18:56,040
Yes

1678
01:18:56,510 --> 01:18:59,910
Are you really?

1679
01:19:00,610 --> 01:19:03,540
A cheat was uncovered,

1680
01:19:04,280 --> 01:19:07,440
and his wife who is naturally so damn stupid

1681
01:19:07,440 --> 01:19:11,610
shaved off all of his pubic hair.

1682
01:19:13,210 --> 01:19:17,910
He's such a SEX SHOP A GO! GO! comedian.

1683
01:19:17,980 --> 01:19:20,580
Who the hell is it?

1684
01:19:20,710 --> 01:19:21,840
That was cruel.

1685
01:19:21,980 --> 01:19:24,580
THAT'S YOU!!

1686
01:19:29,810 --> 01:19:32,740
Now I remember.  I heard about it.

1687
01:19:35,540 --> 01:19:36,540
Shaved off?

1688
01:19:37,210 --> 01:19:38,680
Can't be, right?

1689
01:19:43,480 --> 01:19:44,810
You must be Tanaka.

1690
01:19:45,080 --> 01:19:47,940
Has anything exciting happened lately?

1691
01:19:48,140 --> 01:19:49,610
Um....I think so..

1692
01:19:49,840 --> 01:19:52,410
NEVER MIND!!

1693
01:19:52,440 --> 01:19:55,080
He sleeps then gets up.

1694
01:19:55,080 --> 01:19:58,480
He goes to work in his secondhand Volvo.

1695
01:19:59,410 --> 01:20:02,580
He receives low pay.

1696
01:20:02,580 --> 01:20:05,780
He eats a lunch box.

1697
01:20:05,780 --> 01:20:07,880
He smokes cigarettes.

1698
01:20:07,880 --> 01:20:12,740
He comes home and goes to sleep again.

1699
01:20:12,740 --> 01:20:17,280
He gets up and again goes to work in his secondhand Volvo...

1700
01:20:19,540 --> 01:20:22,210
WHAT A POINTLESS LIFE!!

1701
01:20:26,610 --> 01:20:28,540
It doesn't make sense!

1702
01:20:28,540 --> 01:20:30,210
It's a mess.

1703
01:20:30,310 --> 01:20:32,640
No need for "secondhand"...

1704
01:20:36,180 --> 01:20:38,110
It really hurts!

1705
01:20:42,410 --> 01:20:44,340
You two.

1706
01:20:44,840 --> 01:20:49,440
I heard it will be your 30th anniversary next year?

1707
01:20:49,440 --> 01:20:53,740
That you have been in show business for such a long time,

1708
01:20:53,740 --> 01:20:56,880
proves that everyone loves you.

1709
01:21:00,310 --> 01:21:03,280
You receive damn expensive fees,

1710
01:21:03,280 --> 01:21:07,440
complaining that dramas are tiring

1711
01:21:07,440 --> 01:21:10,480
or saying my knee hurts?

1712
01:21:12,040 --> 01:21:13,810
Who do you think you are!

1713
01:21:14,510 --> 01:21:14,940
Scary.

1714
01:21:15,380 --> 01:21:15,880
Yeah.

1715
01:21:21,680 --> 01:21:23,780
You sure are ugly huh.

1716
01:21:25,780 --> 01:21:28,740
YOU

1717
01:21:26,110 --> 01:21:28,740
DAMN PIG!!

1718
01:21:35,340 --> 01:21:37,610
Why did you start using foul language?

1719
01:21:37,610 --> 01:21:40,080
She said you were an ugly pig..

1720
01:21:44,640 --> 01:21:46,510
Like Sparta

1721
01:21:46,540 --> 01:21:48,640
Now I know what.

1722
01:21:48,840 --> 01:21:51,840
Then, I'll show you.

1723
01:21:51,640 --> 01:21:56,310
Expressing How To Be CA

1724
01:21:52,640 --> 01:21:53,880
Keep your eyes open.

1725
01:22:00,180 --> 01:22:01,140
Are you serious?

1726
01:22:01,740 --> 01:22:03,510
Um.. teacher..

1727
01:22:03,680 --> 01:22:06,210
INUGAMI FAMILY!!

1728
01:22:06,480 --> 01:22:08,580
She couldn't complete it.

1729
01:22:12,780 --> 01:22:15,180
Her legs never got off the ground.

1730
01:22:20,280 --> 01:22:22,880
Her legs never lifted up at all.

1731
01:22:24,310 --> 01:22:26,010
The drawers are not done yet.

1732
01:22:26,640 --> 01:22:29,040
One trial after another.

1733
01:22:33,310 --> 01:22:35,680
Shall we watch the DVD?

1734
01:22:37,110 --> 01:22:40,010
So there are 2 DVDs.  What's written on them?

1735
01:22:40,740 --> 01:22:46,680
Just DVD #1 and #2.  As always.

1736
01:22:47,140 --> 01:22:48,480
We should get it done.

1737
01:22:47,940 --> 01:22:50,940
I guess we watch #1 first.

1738
01:22:53,740 --> 01:22:54,810
It's so tough.

1739
01:22:58,840 --> 01:23:00,710
Tanaka, play the DVD #1.

1740
01:23:00,780 --> 01:23:03,840
Let's see what happens.

1741
01:23:03,840 --> 01:23:04,840
What is it...

1742
01:23:05,680 --> 01:23:06,380
I'm scared

1743
01:23:06,580 --> 01:23:08,140
Are you playing #1?

1744
01:23:08,140 --> 01:23:09,740
What could this be?

1745
01:23:38,140 --> 01:23:40,380
Yamazaki spotted her so quickly.

1746
01:23:40,410 --> 01:23:41,810
I didn't realize.

1747
01:23:42,610 --> 01:23:43,780
Me neither.

1748
01:23:45,880 --> 01:23:47,180
From here again.

1749
01:23:53,940 --> 01:23:56,640
CA Exam Site

1750
01:23:56,680 --> 01:23:58,080
Matsumoto Chiaki.

1751
01:23:58,310 --> 01:24:00,540
Huh?  Where's the exam site?

1752
01:24:01,040 --> 01:24:04,140
The actual character was
named Matsumoto Chiaki.
So they used Chiaki.

1753
01:24:04,740 --> 01:24:06,210
I wonder where I am..

1754
01:24:10,340 --> 01:24:11,380
Wow, cool.

1755
01:24:13,040 --> 01:24:15,510
Wow.

1756
01:24:30,740 --> 01:24:31,940
What is he doing?

1757
01:24:33,010 --> 01:24:34,540
What.. What are you doing?

1758
01:24:45,540 --> 01:24:46,340
What is he doing?

1759
01:24:47,710 --> 01:24:49,310
What.. What are you doing?

1760
01:24:55,840 --> 01:24:56,940
What are you doing?

1761
01:25:06,140 --> 01:25:08,680
Enough of them already.

1762
01:25:11,480 --> 01:25:13,040
This is a killer.

1763
01:25:16,480 --> 01:25:17,780
I see.

1764
01:25:18,140 --> 01:25:22,080
We really should brace ourselves for this.

1765
01:25:20,680 --> 01:25:22,080
You're right.

1766
01:25:25,380 --> 01:25:26,840
What..What are you doing?

1767
01:25:31,040 --> 01:25:33,040
Who are you?  I'll call for help.

1768
01:25:34,540 --> 01:25:39,580
You seem... to be fine.

1769
01:25:39,710 --> 01:25:44,710
You seem... to be fine.

1770
01:25:47,280 --> 01:25:49,810
What is he doing?

1771
01:25:48,840 --> 01:25:52,380
He can't say that short line?

1772
01:25:58,280 --> 01:26:00,540
Please say the lines correctly.

1773
01:26:00,780 --> 01:26:02,940
Who are you?  I'll call for help.

1774
01:26:04,310 --> 01:26:06,980
You seem... to be fine.

1775
01:26:11,110 --> 01:26:12,680
The way he walks..

1776
01:26:13,280 --> 01:26:14,880
Stewardess story.

1777
01:26:14,880 --> 01:26:16,340
Yeah.

1778
01:26:16,840 --> 01:26:19,340
That's a strange way to walk.

1779
01:26:22,480 --> 01:26:29,540
Cabin Attendant Story

1780
01:26:29,540 --> 01:26:30,740
Interview room

1781
01:26:32,880 --> 01:26:35,210
Next group please enter.

1782
01:26:38,580 --> 01:26:41,040
Dad, please wish me luck.

1783
01:26:47,580 --> 01:26:48,710
Thank you for your time.

1784
01:26:47,780 --> 01:26:50,710
Interview room

1785
01:26:48,710 --> 01:26:51,140
Don't use it that way.

1786
01:26:55,810 --> 01:26:57,580
He should notice her instantly!

1787
01:27:04,710 --> 01:27:05,910
What the hell.

1788
01:27:07,910 --> 01:27:09,840
It's too lame.

1789
01:27:12,480 --> 01:27:14,580
Let's unite together.

1790
01:27:14,580 --> 01:27:17,040
Yes.  Let's get through this together.

1791
01:27:17,040 --> 01:27:19,940
You might laugh when others laugh.

1792
01:27:21,440 --> 01:27:23,010
Thank you for your time.

1793
01:27:22,010 --> 01:27:24,740
Interview room

1794
01:27:23,580 --> 01:27:25,540
It's starting from here again.

1795
01:27:40,010 --> 01:27:44,710
Hiki Rie

1796
01:27:40,140 --> 01:27:45,010
I started aspiring to be a CA because my parents often took me abroad and..

1797
01:27:45,140 --> 01:27:51,110
Takaki Mio

1798
01:27:45,140 --> 01:27:51,310
I want to utilize my English skills and develop my career as a CA..

1799
01:27:47,740 --> 01:27:49,380
These are the original actresses.

1800
01:27:51,640 --> 01:27:58,580
Ito Maiko

1801
01:27:51,640 --> 01:27:59,880
I like to associate with people and I feel happy to assist them.

1802
01:28:00,710 --> 01:28:03,180
I... I like the sky...

1803
01:28:03,610 --> 01:28:07,480
As..as a child, I've always liked planes.

1804
01:28:08,110 --> 01:28:11,010
I want to become a CA as soon as possible..

1805
01:28:12,110 --> 01:28:13,480
and want to move out my house.

1806
01:28:14,640 --> 01:28:16,110
Want to move out your house?

1807
01:28:16,110 --> 01:28:17,140
Yes.

1808
01:28:17,310 --> 01:28:19,710
My mom remarried but..

1809
01:28:20,210 --> 01:28:25,410
I can't associate well with my new dad and siblings.

1810
01:28:25,910 --> 01:28:27,840
You are selfish.

1811
01:28:27,980 --> 01:28:28,940
What is it?

1812
01:28:30,640 --> 01:28:31,880
His timing was off

1813
01:28:31,880 --> 01:28:35,810
You are not cooperative. You can't be a cabin attendant.

1814
01:28:35,810 --> 01:28:37,580
Why do you think so?

1815
01:28:38,540 --> 01:28:40,340
Why do you say such a thing?

1816
01:28:40,710 --> 01:28:43,280
Because I mistook you as a pervert and scratched your face?

1817
01:28:45,140 --> 01:28:45,940
OK, next.

1818
01:28:46,510 --> 01:28:47,340
Why?

1819
01:28:47,340 --> 01:28:48,040
Come here.

1820
01:28:48,110 --> 01:28:49,280
I'm sure.

1821
01:28:50,240 --> 01:28:51,740
Are you going to fail me?

1822
01:28:51,740 --> 01:28:53,410
What's with that expression, Endo?

1823
01:28:53,480 --> 01:28:56,040
This was hard for me.

1824
01:28:55,640 --> 01:28:56,940
I'm home.

1825
01:29:01,740 --> 01:29:02,940
What time do you think it is?

1826
01:29:03,180 --> 01:29:06,540
Step father

1827
01:29:03,710 --> 01:29:06,610
Where were you?  Why didn't you call?

1828
01:29:06,610 --> 01:29:07,310
Wow..

1829
01:29:07,380 --> 01:29:08,140
I'm sorry.

1830
01:29:08,880 --> 01:29:11,980
Mother

1831
01:29:09,910 --> 01:29:12,440
Welcome home.  How was the interview?

1832
01:29:12,680 --> 01:29:14,440
Mom, it didn't go well.

1833
01:29:14,440 --> 01:29:15,510
I gave it up.

1834
01:29:15,680 --> 01:29:16,580
Hey!

1835
01:29:15,980 --> 01:29:20,180
Step brother

1836
01:29:17,410 --> 01:29:18,540
There he is.

1837
01:29:18,540 --> 01:29:21,540
Wasn't it your dream to become a CA?

1838
01:29:21,910 --> 01:29:22,640
Yeah,

1839
01:29:22,110 --> 01:29:26,210
Step sister

1840
01:29:23,880 --> 01:29:25,910
you gave it up in one day?

1841
01:29:25,810 --> 01:29:28,040
Good drama.

1842
01:29:26,280 --> 01:29:27,910
you have no guts, huh?

1843
01:29:28,040 --> 01:29:29,480
It's an all star cast

1844
01:29:28,080 --> 01:29:32,740
If you are not true to yourself, you can't be a CA anyway.

1845
01:29:33,380 --> 01:29:34,980
It's good that you gave up.

1846
01:29:36,610 --> 01:29:38,240
I won't give it up.

1847
01:29:38,810 --> 01:29:39,580
I'll do it.

1848
01:29:40,080 --> 01:29:40,810
What?

1849
01:29:43,680 --> 01:29:47,140
I'll try my best to become a CA!

1850
01:29:48,280 --> 01:29:49,140
Chiaki!

1851
01:29:51,980 --> 01:29:54,980
Gaasuu Airline Training Center

1852
01:29:56,080 --> 01:29:58,980
Service test

1853
01:29:56,110 --> 01:29:57,440
Here's wine for you.

1854
01:29:57,440 --> 01:29:59,440
It's no good.  What kind of smile is that?

1855
01:30:00,040 --> 01:30:02,540
A good smile comes from your heart.

1856
01:30:03,280 --> 01:30:04,280
I can't smile.

1857
01:30:04,740 --> 01:30:06,010
I want to cry.

1858
01:30:06,010 --> 01:30:06,880
What's this?

1859
01:30:07,080 --> 01:30:09,780
As a CA, you have to smile even when you want to cry.

1860
01:30:10,880 --> 01:30:12,510
You better quit.

1861
01:30:12,510 --> 01:30:13,980
Shin-Oni Instructor.

1862
01:30:15,210 --> 01:30:18,580
Shin-Oni Instructor, you're being too strict.

1863
01:30:18,740 --> 01:30:19,810
Shut up. Get away.

1864
01:30:20,240 --> 01:30:23,440
Get away! Get away! Get away!!

1865
01:30:27,310 --> 01:30:28,180
Shut up. Get away.

1866
01:30:28,780 --> 01:30:31,680
Get away! Get away! Get away!!

1867
01:30:37,440 --> 01:30:41,040
Shin-Oni, acting like a kid.

1868
01:30:39,880 --> 01:30:42,440
I want him to change his name.

1869
01:30:49,340 --> 01:30:52,240
Not Shin-Oni Instructor.

1870
01:30:52,610 --> 01:30:55,710
Shin-Oni Instructor, you're being too strict.

1871
01:30:56,110 --> 01:30:57,080
Shut up. Get away!

1872
01:30:57,580 --> 01:31:00,680
Get away! Get away! Get away!!

1873
01:31:05,310 --> 01:31:06,610
Shin-Oni Instructor!

1874
01:31:06,980 --> 01:31:09,440
Please don't abandon me!

1875
01:31:09,510 --> 01:31:12,380
To be frank, you are not suitable as a CA.

1876
01:31:12,910 --> 01:31:16,940
I admit I am clumsy and as slow as a turtle.

1877
01:31:17,210 --> 01:31:19,610
But I really want to be a CA!

1878
01:31:20,540 --> 01:31:23,380
Since I was child this high, it has been my dream.

1879
01:31:23,380 --> 01:31:24,810
Dream is dream.

1880
01:31:25,710 --> 01:31:29,710
If I can't become a CA, I would kill myself.

1881
01:31:29,880 --> 01:31:31,340
What did you say?

1882
01:31:31,480 --> 01:31:33,180
But Shin-Oni Instructor.

1883
01:31:33,640 --> 01:31:36,780
You are the one killing me.  It's YOU!

1884
01:31:36,980 --> 01:31:37,780
Wait!

1885
01:31:44,180 --> 01:31:47,080
I understand.

1886
01:31:47,310 --> 01:31:48,540
I don't want you to die.

1887
01:31:49,040 --> 01:31:51,740
Until you become a successful cabin attendant,

1888
01:31:51,880 --> 01:31:54,580
I'll train you hard.  Be prepared.

1889
01:31:55,010 --> 01:31:56,580
Shin-Oni Instructor.

1890
01:32:01,440 --> 01:32:03,410
What is he doing, just leave her.

1891
01:32:07,540 --> 01:32:08,510
You.

1892
01:32:09,010 --> 01:32:10,510
You are beaten by that girl.

1893
01:32:11,010 --> 01:32:16,340
She is so focused on her dream.  I never knew such a person still existed.

1894
01:32:12,380 --> 01:32:14,610
I don't get how he lost

1895
01:32:16,880 --> 01:32:18,040
She is just like

1896
01:32:19,110 --> 01:32:20,340
how you were before.

1897
01:32:21,280 --> 01:32:23,210
I... I decided.

1898
01:32:23,210 --> 01:32:26,140
I will let everyone pass the test.

1899
01:32:27,040 --> 01:32:27,780
Will you?

1900
01:32:28,140 --> 01:32:28,640
Yes!

1901
01:32:36,240 --> 01:32:37,840
Do you remember the name of this cheese?

1902
01:32:38,440 --> 01:32:41,640
I'm sorry.  I can't remember when I'm nervous.

1903
01:32:44,740 --> 01:32:47,280
If you can't, you just have to make a song of it.

1904
01:32:47,610 --> 01:32:48,640
Try singing this.

1905
01:32:49,440 --> 01:32:50,780
Was this scene
like the original?

1906
01:32:50,780 --> 01:32:52,780
I guess so.

1907
01:32:52,780 --> 01:32:56,440
"This cheese is known in England"

1908
01:32:57,180 --> 01:33:00,740
"as the most delicious cheese"

1909
01:33:01,310 --> 01:33:05,240
The great, Shin-Oni Instructor. He's such an idea man.

1910
01:33:12,880 --> 01:33:16,010
Everyone that was in the
original drama is in this.

1911
01:33:16,740 --> 01:33:19,810
I won't forgive you Shin-Oni!

1912
01:33:20,180 --> 01:33:22,940
Please transfer him somewhere far away.

1913
01:33:27,240 --> 01:33:28,380
Understood.

1914
01:33:29,510 --> 01:33:33,480
I am now going to announce the results of the exam.

1915
01:33:35,880 --> 01:33:37,310
Everyone passed!

1916
01:33:39,580 --> 01:33:43,340
From today, you all are CA!

1917
01:33:44,880 --> 01:33:45,710
Excuse me.

1918
01:33:45,980 --> 01:33:47,440
Where is Shin-Oni Instructor?

1919
01:33:49,440 --> 01:33:51,610
He has been transfered to Paris.

1920
01:33:52,140 --> 01:33:54,240
He gave all of you his best regards.

1921
01:34:01,110 --> 01:34:02,110
Instructor!

1922
01:34:02,510 --> 01:34:04,110
Shin-Oni Instructor!

1923
01:34:07,080 --> 01:34:09,640
I passed the CA entrance exam.

1924
01:34:09,780 --> 01:34:10,740
Congratulations.

1925
01:34:10,840 --> 01:34:13,480
Can I fall into your arms?

1926
01:34:13,710 --> 01:34:15,480
I don't want a crash landing.

1927
01:34:16,140 --> 01:34:17,510
Shin-Oni Instructor!

1928
01:34:19,310 --> 01:34:21,580
"I don't want a crash landing"

1929
01:34:31,240 --> 01:34:33,540
I'm jealous but I'm happy for you.

1930
01:34:40,940 --> 01:34:42,140
Embarrassing, huh?

1931
01:35:02,280 --> 01:35:04,180
Cheers.

1932
01:35:23,040 --> 01:35:26,810
I'm really glad that everyone passed.

1933
01:35:27,440 --> 01:35:28,280
Yes!

1934
01:35:29,340 --> 01:35:32,040
Instructor! Shin-Oni Instructor!

1935
01:35:36,080 --> 01:35:37,180
It's her.

1936
01:35:37,940 --> 01:35:39,010
What is it, Chiemi?

1937
01:35:39,180 --> 01:35:40,140
Chiemi Senior.

1938
01:35:40,610 --> 01:35:41,340
Instructor.

1939
01:35:41,780 --> 01:35:44,180
In fact, not everyone passed.

1940
01:35:44,310 --> 01:35:45,740
What do you mean?

1941
01:35:46,140 --> 01:35:48,540
Actually...

1942
01:35:48,740 --> 01:35:51,510
only Tanaka was OUT.

1943
01:35:51,940 --> 01:36:00,010
Furthermore, Tanaka will be Thai-kicked.

1944
01:36:03,910 --> 01:36:11,580
End

1945
01:36:06,810 --> 01:36:08,740
They're all looking and laughing.

1946
01:36:08,740 --> 01:36:09,610
Oh, yeah.

1947
01:36:10,040 --> 01:36:12,110
That's scary!

1948
01:36:18,680 --> 01:36:20,740
I don't get it.  What does it mean?

1949
01:36:21,740 --> 01:36:23,140
Huh?  Why?

1950
01:36:23,110 --> 01:36:30,010
Substitute For The CA Of The Same Name Who Failed The Exam

1951
01:36:24,280 --> 01:36:25,240
All of a sudden?

1952
01:36:26,080 --> 01:36:29,240
Tanaka... Don't move around too much.

1953
01:36:29,980 --> 01:36:30,840
Watch out.

1954
01:36:30,080 --> 01:36:31,780
It's all of a sudden.

1955
01:36:32,210 --> 01:36:34,140
It had nothing to do with this.

1956
01:36:34,140 --> 01:36:35,580
She said Tanaka OUT.

1957
01:36:35,580 --> 01:36:37,140
Hey wait!  Are you serious?

1958
01:36:37,140 --> 01:36:38,440
Tanaka, stay still.

1959
01:36:38,440 --> 01:36:39,840
It's gonna hurt..

1960
01:36:47,080 --> 01:36:47,840
It hurts..

1961
01:36:51,380 --> 01:36:52,080
It hurts..

1962
01:36:55,680 --> 01:36:56,810
It hurts...

1963
01:37:03,740 --> 01:37:05,640
Damn you!

1964
01:37:05,640 --> 01:37:07,180
I know how you feel.

1965
01:37:08,140 --> 01:37:09,780
I know it hurts.

1966
01:37:09,780 --> 01:37:12,210
It doesn't sound like it, but it hurts.

1967
01:37:13,280 --> 01:37:15,580
Aren't you laughing?

1968
01:37:16,180 --> 01:37:18,880
You were laughing just now, right?

1969
01:37:17,140 --> 01:37:18,880
Yes, you were.

1970
01:37:18,880 --> 01:37:20,780
He was laughing from the pain.

1971
01:37:20,780 --> 01:37:21,780
Too much pain?

1972
01:37:22,110 --> 01:37:24,440
No... I didn't laugh.

1973
01:37:35,510 --> 01:37:37,540
Someone's out.  What happened?

1974
01:37:39,040 --> 01:37:39,880
You did it, right?

1975
01:37:40,440 --> 01:37:41,710
I don't know.

1976
01:37:41,710 --> 01:37:43,210
What happened?

1977
01:37:48,140 --> 01:37:49,780
I really didn't know.

1978
01:37:49,910 --> 01:37:51,440
You're lying.

1979
01:38:00,680 --> 01:38:03,840
I really didn't know.

1980
01:38:06,280 --> 01:38:08,040
This is no good.

1981
01:38:08,040 --> 01:38:09,810
This is not right.

1982
01:38:10,410 --> 01:38:12,740
It was in the desk.

1983
01:38:13,110 --> 01:38:15,480
Isn't it wrong that it was in the desk?

1984
01:38:16,580 --> 01:38:18,310
This is no good.

1985
01:38:18,780 --> 01:38:20,940
I'll put it away.

1986
01:38:20,940 --> 01:38:21,810
Yes, thank you.

1987
01:38:26,040 --> 01:38:29,310
3 hours and a half hours since the start of duty.

1988
01:38:36,110 --> 01:38:37,140
Listen up.

1989
01:38:37,780 --> 01:38:41,610
We are now going to be attending the welcoming ceremony for new CA.

1990
01:38:43,080 --> 01:38:46,780
Since it'll be cold, I prepared coats for everyone to wear.

1991
01:38:46,810 --> 01:38:48,740
I don't want to go to a cold place.

1992
01:38:49,040 --> 01:38:55,640
Attending The Welcoming Ceremony

1993
01:38:56,940 --> 01:39:00,680
A coat like this won't protect me from the cold!

1994
01:39:03,240 --> 01:39:06,180
My bottom area is cold.

1995
01:39:06,180 --> 01:39:08,180
Cold..

1996
01:39:08,810 --> 01:39:09,910
Whoa.

1997
01:39:11,240 --> 01:39:12,810
Thank you, guys.

1998
01:39:12,940 --> 01:39:17,110
Private SP Stairs Assistance

1999
01:39:13,940 --> 01:39:16,580
It was really pain in the ass.

2000
01:39:20,140 --> 01:39:22,610
By the way, Yamazaki has been laughing for quite a while.

2001
01:39:22,610 --> 01:39:24,310
You too, Matsumoto-san.

2002
01:39:25,940 --> 01:39:27,210
OK, thank you.

2003
01:39:30,110 --> 01:39:31,310
They are still going.

2004
01:39:30,980 --> 01:39:32,080
I'm good already.

2005
01:39:31,940 --> 01:39:34,940
I doubt they understand what you said.

2006
01:39:36,610 --> 01:39:39,680
Ugh... there are a lot of people there.

2007
01:39:39,480 --> 01:39:44,780
GAS Training Grounds

2008
01:39:43,940 --> 01:39:45,780
Everyone, here.

2009
01:39:47,910 --> 01:39:49,880
Here is fine, thank you.

2010
01:39:48,910 --> 01:39:49,940
OK, thank you.

2011
01:39:51,040 --> 01:39:52,140
Cold!

2012
01:39:52,140 --> 01:39:55,380
Your seats are the front row.

2013
01:39:55,480 --> 01:39:57,380
OK, got it.

2014
01:40:00,010 --> 01:40:01,210
So, cold.

2015
01:40:07,340 --> 01:40:11,140
The newbie welcoming ceremony will now commence.

2016
01:40:11,510 --> 01:40:15,340
Before it starts, to welcome our newbies,

2017
01:40:15,340 --> 01:40:18,910
we invited famous musical artists from overseas.

2018
01:40:18,640 --> 01:40:19,810
What's that..

2019
01:40:19,810 --> 01:40:20,810
If you will!

2020
01:40:20,810 --> 01:40:21,980
I doubt it.

2021
01:40:31,710 --> 01:40:38,580
Famous Celebrity Artist Appears

2022
01:40:42,580 --> 01:40:45,680
Celebrity Artist

2023

Watanabe Naomi

2024
01:40:56,610 --> 01:40:57,740
That face

2025
01:41:01,080 --> 01:41:02,740
She gained weight again.
- Yeah.

2026
01:41:42,240 --> 01:41:48,880
Another Famous Celebrity Artist

2027
01:41:51,710 --> 01:41:54,910

She can't get off.

2030
01:42:02,310 --> 01:42:04,440
Your song is starting.

2031
01:42:17,880 --> 01:42:20,310
You had one more step!

2032
01:42:21,380 --> 01:42:26,880
Dream Collaboration

2033
01:43:19,240 --> 01:43:23,040
That's fine. I'm fine with OUT.

2034
01:43:30,040 --> 01:43:32,510
It hurts more because it's cold!

2035
01:43:33,010 --> 01:43:38,840
Next, we will introduce our new instructors that just transfered in today.

2036
01:43:39,310 --> 01:43:40,940
Please come up to the stage.

2037
01:43:41,310 --> 01:43:42,210
Cold.

2038
01:43:44,080 --> 01:43:50,240
Introduction Of New Instructors

2039
01:43:44,280 --> 01:43:44,980
What the hell.

2040
01:43:50,710 --> 01:43:55,280
Gushiken Youkou Instructor, please do a short introduction of yourself.

2041

01:43:59,080 --> 01:44:04,740
I'm Gushiken Youkou, just transferred from Ishigaki island.

2044
01:44:05,940 --> 01:44:23,840
* The members don't understand his dialect.

2045
01:44:12,580 --> 01:44:16,780
Speaking In The Ishigaki Dialect

2046
01:44:28,580 --> 01:44:29,710
I didn't understand it at all.

2047
01:44:29,440 --> 01:44:31,340
I caught the mobile phone part.

2048
01:44:31,340 --> 01:44:32,240
Yeah, me too.

2049
01:44:32,040 --> 01:44:33,610
He said mobile phone.

2050
01:44:38,380 --> 01:44:51,210
* Speaking in the Ishigaki Dialect. The members don't understand it.

2051
01:44:54,340 --> 01:44:55,780
He said karaoke?

2052
01:44:55,880 --> 01:44:57,380
He did.

2053
01:45:00,580 --> 01:45:01,810
It's a long intro, huh?

2054
01:45:01,810 --> 01:45:13,110
* Speaking in the Ishigaki Dialect. The members don't understand it.

2055
01:45:13,840 --> 01:45:19,280
Stand Accidentally Falls

2056
01:45:18,610 --> 01:45:20,440
Give me a break.

2057
01:45:22,210 --> 01:45:23,810
What the hell.

2058
01:45:25,480 --> 01:45:26,480
Why?

2059
01:45:33,640 --> 01:45:35,580
Thank you, Gushiken Instructor.

2060
01:45:35,680 --> 01:45:39,410
Up next is Takeda Instructor.

2061
01:45:39,410 --> 01:45:43,940
*We didn't inform Takeda Instructor that he has to do the introduction.

2062
01:45:48,710 --> 01:45:50,040
They didn't tell him.

2063
01:45:50,210 --> 01:45:51,340
Takeda Instructor if you will.

2064
01:45:55,510 --> 01:45:56,810
They didn't.
- No.

2065
01:45:57,740 --> 01:45:59,540
I want to see how he handles it.
- Yeah

2066
01:46:03,480 --> 01:46:06,610
New Instructor

2067
01:46:03,480 --> 01:46:06,610
Takeda Nobuhiro

2068
01:46:04,110 --> 01:46:05,780
Takeda-san, your introduction please.

2069
01:46:06,610 --> 01:46:10,140
Takeda Instructor's Ad-lib Introduction

2070
01:46:10,610 --> 01:46:14,910
Well..

2071
01:46:12,740 --> 01:46:14,910
Please do your best.

2072
01:46:14,910 --> 01:46:19,040
That's all.

2073
01:46:17,210 --> 01:46:19,040
Excuse me.

2074
01:46:26,240 --> 01:46:27,240
Takeda...

2075
01:46:31,740 --> 01:46:35,210
Next up is Batsugun Instructor.

2076
01:46:35,810 --> 01:46:39,110
New Instructor

2077
01:46:35,810 --> 01:46:39,110
Nishio Hidetaka

2078
01:46:35,810 --> 01:46:39,110
Sagane Masahiro

2079
01:46:39,540 --> 01:46:42,740
We are still new, so we want to

2080
01:46:43,180 --> 01:46:48,010
learn with you. Let's try our best.

2081
01:46:48,010 --> 01:46:52,640
Sagane Instructor, what nickname would you liked to be called by your students?

2082
01:46:56,640 --> 01:47:00,080
"Margaret-chan"

2083
01:47:00,080 --> 01:47:01,410
Please.

2084
01:47:02,410 --> 01:47:06,080
Instructors, we are counting on you from here on.

2085
01:47:06,880 --> 01:47:08,140
Thank you.

2086
01:47:17,280 --> 01:47:19,580
Excuse me? Can I have a little time?

2087
01:47:21,040 --> 01:47:22,110
What the hell was it?

2088
01:47:23,440 --> 01:47:24,440
Margaret-chan?

2089
01:47:25,280 --> 01:47:26,110
What's wrong?

2090
01:47:26,140 --> 01:47:31,310
Nishio Judging Sagane

2091
01:47:26,340 --> 01:47:27,040
I didn't know.

2092
01:47:27,780 --> 01:47:31,280
You didn't know?  You should know that's how variety is.

2093
01:47:31,710 --> 01:47:35,080
We were always longing to be on this No-laughing, right?

2094
01:47:35,340 --> 01:47:37,880
This was our big break.

2095
01:47:38,140 --> 01:47:41,280
You just wasted it.

2096
01:47:41,280 --> 01:47:42,980
We are finished.

2097
01:47:44,980 --> 01:47:45,740
Can I say something?

2098
01:47:45,810 --> 01:47:48,210
No, I'm talking.

2099
01:47:48,210 --> 01:47:50,040
Hey wait. Don't interrupt.

2100
01:47:49,110 --> 01:47:50,740
What about you?

2101
01:47:50,080 --> 01:47:50,740
Huh?

2102
01:47:50,740 --> 01:47:53,440
Sagane Rebelling

2103
01:47:51,340 --> 01:47:53,340
So you are perfect, then?

2104
01:47:53,680 --> 01:47:54,710
He's rebelling.

2105
01:47:54,710 --> 01:47:57,740
You often say ordinary stuff too!

2106
01:47:57,740 --> 01:47:59,840
What was your comment?

2107
01:47:59,840 --> 01:48:01,610
"Let's try out best?"

2108
01:48:01,610 --> 01:48:03,480
Say something funny!

2109
01:48:03,480 --> 01:48:05,580
Then I can add to it as Tukkomi, right?

2110
01:48:06,080 --> 01:48:10,180
I can't do my job unless you say something funny.

2111
01:48:10,180 --> 01:48:14,610
If you can't,

2112
01:48:12,810 --> 01:48:14,610
we are done.

2113
01:48:18,940 --> 01:48:20,880
Oh are you done?

2114
01:48:20,880 --> 01:48:21,910
Done?

2115
01:48:22,040 --> 01:48:23,740
It seems to be silent.

2116
01:48:24,040 --> 01:48:25,440
Now that I don't hear anything,

2117
01:48:25,440 --> 01:48:28,880
it means you are done talking, right?

2118
01:48:28,880 --> 01:48:32,510
I only sense your foul breath.

2119
01:48:44,480 --> 01:48:48,280
We visited that family for filming the other day, right?

2120
01:48:48,280 --> 01:48:50,080
At the time you were saying...

2121
01:48:50,140 --> 01:48:51,610
"Grandma is such a good cook" and

2122
01:48:51,610 --> 01:48:53,880
"Grandma, are you caring?"

2123
01:48:53,880 --> 01:48:55,880
You said that, right?

2124
01:48:58,280 --> 01:48:59,910
She was their Mom.

2125
01:49:01,310 --> 01:49:07,080
She had her children late in age.  She was the mom not Grandma.

2126
01:49:10,880 --> 01:49:12,210
Why only us?

2127
01:49:12,210 --> 01:49:13,410
It was obvious everyone laughed.

2128
01:49:13,410 --> 01:49:14,740
Everyone laughed.

2129
01:49:14,740 --> 01:49:16,540
Yamazaki has been missed.

2130
01:49:21,610 --> 01:49:24,180
You better watch out.

2131
01:49:24,180 --> 01:49:25,310
Or we are done.

2132
01:49:25,310 --> 01:49:28,080
I'm sorry...

2133
01:49:28,780 --> 01:49:30,480
You too. Don't be daydreaming.

2134
01:49:30,680 --> 01:49:31,340
Gushiken-san.

2135
01:49:31,380 --> 01:49:37,310
Spilling Over To Gushiken

2136
01:49:31,980 --> 01:49:34,480
Look at me.  I'm talking to you.

2137
01:49:35,480 --> 01:49:39,080
You don't understand where you are standing, just like Sagane.

2138
01:49:42,410 --> 01:49:44,640
I didn't mean it literally.

2139
01:49:49,940 --> 01:49:52,740
Wait. Cocorico was laughing.

2140
01:49:53,310 --> 01:49:54,680
Cocorico was laughing too!

2141
01:49:54,380 --> 01:49:56,110
Don't miss Cocorico.

2142
01:49:56,110 --> 01:49:56,910
We didn't laugh.

2143
01:50:03,110 --> 01:50:07,140
When you were on Hanamaru Market the other day, you were asked for your motto.

2144
01:50:07,140 --> 01:50:07,940
Yes.

2145
01:50:07,940 --> 01:50:09,340
You wrote it on a flip.

2146
01:50:09,340 --> 01:50:10,680
Isshoukenmei (Always do my best).

2147
01:50:10,680 --> 01:50:11,040
Yes.

2148
01:50:11,040 --> 01:50:14,680
You changed the word "懸(ken) "to  "拳 (ken)", which means fist, right?

2149
01:50:14,740 --> 01:50:15,180
Yes.

2150
01:50:15,340 --> 01:50:16,880
It means force.

2151
01:50:16,880 --> 01:50:20,540
Will you bring people into submission by force forever?

2152
01:50:20,610 --> 01:50:21,540
I'm talking here.

2153
01:50:21,540 --> 01:50:23,310
Yes, I'll try my best

2154
01:50:22,580 --> 01:50:23,680
No, don't.

2155
01:50:34,710 --> 01:50:36,680
Since it's cold, it's cold... I mean it hurts.

2156
01:50:36,680 --> 01:50:38,910
You wrote the kanji  "拳", right?

2157
01:50:39,340 --> 01:50:41,240
You shouldn't be able to.

2158
01:50:41,910 --> 01:50:44,910
Don't even think about it.  Just now, you made people laugh by looking at the ground.

2159
01:50:45,180 --> 01:50:48,440
You can make everyone laugh with such accidents.

2160
01:50:48,940 --> 01:50:52,240
So don't try.  A moron has to be a moron.

2161
01:51:03,640 --> 01:51:05,540
If you don't stop it,

2162
01:51:06,680 --> 01:51:07,780
You're finished.

2163
01:51:09,010 --> 01:51:11,310
You are making a sour face, but you too.

2164
01:51:11,440 --> 01:51:14,440
Spilling Over To Takeda Too

2165
01:51:12,080 --> 01:51:13,880
What just happen to you?

2166
01:51:15,010 --> 01:51:17,540
You were asked to speak, and you froze.

2167
01:51:17,540 --> 01:51:19,240
You didn't think you would be asked.
- No.

2168
01:51:19,840 --> 01:51:21,780
Of course you would be asked.

2169
01:51:21,780 --> 01:51:24,780
Who would pay you for doing nothing?

2170
01:51:24,780 --> 01:51:26,440
That's who you are.

2171
01:51:26,440 --> 01:51:28,940
I would call Gushiken-san a useful moron.

2172
01:51:30,740 --> 01:51:31,540
Huh?

2173
01:51:33,980 --> 01:51:37,080
I'm sorry

2174
01:51:40,480 --> 01:51:42,280
Why did he laugh?

2175
01:51:45,810 --> 01:51:47,740
Why did he laugh?

2176
01:51:47,910 --> 01:51:49,040
Do your jobs.
- OK.

2177
01:51:50,740 --> 01:51:52,940
Excuse me. Thank you for the time.

2178
01:51:55,510 --> 01:51:59,940
Next, we're going have our Gaasuu Cheer leading team perform.

2179
01:52:00,380 --> 01:52:05,980
This fall they earned their 8th consecutive win at the National convention.

2180
01:52:05,980 --> 01:52:07,510
Here they come!

2181
01:52:07,910 --> 01:52:13,080
Cheer Leading Team Performance

2182
01:52:22,040 --> 01:52:26,980
Umezu Kazuo (75) Is Also A Member

2183
01:52:57,780 --> 01:52:59,010
So clumsy.

2184
01:53:08,910 --> 01:53:10,610
What the hell are you doing!

2185
01:53:20,640 --> 01:53:21,610
So skinny.

2186
01:53:21,810 --> 01:53:23,280
Like drift wood.

2187
01:53:27,540 --> 01:53:29,010
What was that?

2188
01:53:29,880 --> 01:53:35,280
Did you see what our Cheer leadingunu.... Cheer leading team can do?

2189
01:53:35,280 --> 01:53:36,740
Let's return.

2190
01:53:38,280 --> 01:53:41,380
He really is something.

2191
01:53:41,940 --> 01:53:46,810
1st Floor Hallway

2192
01:53:42,680 --> 01:53:45,740
Next room is on the 1st floor so..

2193
01:53:46,010 --> 01:53:50,210
Everyone, here is a consultation room for trainees.

2194
01:53:50,480 --> 01:53:51,480
Excuse us.

2195
01:53:52,740 --> 01:53:54,240
Everyone, be quiet.

2196
01:53:54,240 --> 01:53:57,780
The doctor is not here yet, so let's sit here and wait.

2197
01:53:58,110 --> 01:53:59,280
Where's Chief?

2198
01:53:59,310 --> 01:54:02,910
She just left for an operation with a cancer patient.

2199
01:54:02,910 --> 01:54:04,480
She's not coming?

2200
01:54:04,480 --> 01:54:05,480
I'm sorry.

2201
01:54:05,480 --> 01:54:08,710
I doubt a newly transferred doctor can handle this situation.

2202
01:54:10,540 --> 01:54:12,680
Oh Doctor!

2203
01:54:13,810 --> 01:54:16,910
Mita Yoshiko

2204
01:54:13,810 --> 01:54:16,910
Training School Doctor

2205
01:54:16,640 --> 01:54:18,780
How's the patient?

2206
01:54:19,910 --> 01:54:22,310
The appendix seems to be ruptured.

2207
01:54:22,310 --> 01:54:25,710
Please take this patient to an operating room ASAP.

2208
01:54:35,040 --> 01:54:36,380
Will she be OK?

2209
01:54:36,910 --> 01:54:39,510
We came at such a critical time...

2210
01:54:44,610 --> 01:54:46,340
Shall we introduce ourselves?

2211
01:54:46,340 --> 01:54:47,980
First up is Endo.

2212
01:54:47,980 --> 01:54:50,680
Yes. I'm Endo Shouzou.

2213
01:54:50,680 --> 01:54:52,040
Nice to meet you.

2214
01:54:55,010 --> 01:54:56,510
Nice to meet you too.

2215
01:54:57,340 --> 01:54:58,310
You.

2216
01:54:59,210 --> 01:55:01,640
What's your favorite sport?

2217
01:55:01,640 --> 01:55:03,510
It's golfing

2218
01:55:05,040 --> 01:55:08,310
Golfing!

2219
01:55:09,540 --> 01:55:11,480
That's what Jumbo Ozaki plays right?

2220
01:55:13,110 --> 01:55:13,780
Yes.

2221
01:55:22,110 --> 01:55:23,140
There are a lot more...

2222
01:55:23,140 --> 01:55:25,010
Besides Jumbo-san.

2223
01:55:25,010 --> 01:55:26,240
I mean..

2224
01:55:27,740 --> 01:55:29,810
because it is a popular sport.

2225
01:55:29,440 --> 01:55:29,940
Yes.

2226
01:55:30,440 --> 01:55:31,940
Like say, Ishikawa Ryo.

2227
01:55:32,540 --> 01:55:33,380
Next up is Hamada.

2228
01:55:33,410 --> 01:55:35,780
Yes.  I'm Hamada Masatoshi.

2229
01:55:35,780 --> 01:55:37,010
Nice to meet you.

2230
01:55:37,840 --> 01:55:39,780
Nice to meet you too.
- Nice to meet you..

2231
01:55:41,040 --> 01:55:44,980
Do you have another occupation?  What do you usually do?

2232
01:55:45,180 --> 01:55:48,110
I am a comedian.

2233
01:55:46,480 --> 01:55:47,110
Oh are you?

2234
01:55:47,110 --> 01:55:47,840
Yes.

2235
01:55:48,110 --> 01:55:53,410
What role do you play?

2236
01:55:53,410 --> 01:55:54,410
Uh... I'm Tsukkomi

2237
01:55:56,010 --> 01:55:59,040
Tsu...kkomi...

2238
01:55:59,980 --> 01:56:04,840
It's the same as Tsusumishita, right?

2239
01:56:16,410 --> 01:56:19,040
Why did she think of saying Tsutsumishita?

2240
01:56:19,780 --> 01:56:21,040
Next up is Matsumoto.

2241
01:56:22,010 --> 01:56:23,540
Yes. I'm Matsumoto Hitoshi.

2242
01:56:23,540 --> 01:56:24,540
Nice to meet you.

2243
01:56:26,480 --> 01:56:30,110
Nice to meet you too.

2244
01:56:35,340 --> 01:56:36,540
She's like this.

2245
01:56:45,580 --> 01:56:48,110
How old are you?

2246
01:56:48,110 --> 01:56:49,380
Uh... I turned 48.

2247
01:56:49,580 --> 01:56:52,340
48...

2248
01:56:53,610 --> 01:56:59,040
That's HTS(Hitoshi) 48, huh?

2249
01:56:55,210 --> 01:56:56,740
That's funny.

2250
01:57:02,410 --> 01:57:03,840
What the hell..

2251
01:57:04,780 --> 01:57:05,740
What are you saying.

2252
01:57:05,740 --> 01:57:06,840
Not funny..

2253
01:57:06,380 --> 01:57:08,840
What the hell is HTS48?

2254
01:57:15,980 --> 01:57:17,410
Doctor, a critical patient!

2255
01:57:20,940 --> 01:57:22,040
How is it?

2256
01:57:23,640 --> 01:57:25,240
What's the situation?

2257
01:57:25,240 --> 01:57:27,780
A rib bone is stuck in an organ and it is bleeding heavily.

2258
01:57:27,780 --> 01:57:30,580
That is quite a severe situation.

2259
01:57:32,210 --> 01:57:36,140
Sudden Change in Patient Condition

2260
01:57:34,810 --> 01:57:37,280
Get ready for an operation now!

2261
01:57:37,810 --> 01:57:40,080
I'll take care of you until you are OK.

2262
01:57:40,440 --> 01:57:41,580
Hey there..

2263
01:57:40,880 --> 01:57:41,580
Hey you..

2264
01:57:41,580 --> 01:57:44,010
Hey you...

2265
01:57:42,210 --> 01:57:44,010
Hamada!

2266
01:57:42,840 --> 01:57:43,880
Hamada-san.

2267
01:57:44,010 --> 01:57:45,610
Come here and hold him.

2268
01:57:46,310 --> 01:57:49,410
OK? Hold him tight.

2269
01:57:48,410 --> 01:57:49,240
OK..

2270
01:57:49,410 --> 01:57:51,940
I said to hold him tight!

2271
01:57:51,940 --> 01:57:54,740
What are you doing!

2272
01:57:54,740 --> 01:57:57,080
What's your problem?

2273
01:57:56,180 --> 01:57:57,080
I'm sorry.

2274
01:57:58,380 --> 01:58:00,240
You've got what a man should have, right!?

2275
01:58:01,480 --> 01:58:05,310
Searching for Hamada's Balls

2276
01:58:15,140 --> 01:58:17,040
Hang in there. I'll be back soon!

2277
01:58:19,980 --> 01:58:21,510
He's dying...

2278
01:58:20,780 --> 01:58:21,910
He'll be OK.

2279
01:58:22,440 --> 01:58:23,210
He's left behind.

2280
01:58:23,210 --> 01:58:23,880
Yeah.

2281
01:58:23,880 --> 01:58:24,810
He didn't introduce himself.

2282
01:58:24,810 --> 01:58:27,080
Yama-chan, why don't you introduce yourself to him.

2283
01:58:28,940 --> 01:58:30,540
I'm Yamasaki Housei.

2284
01:58:31,080 --> 01:58:33,280
My hobby is playing mah-jong.

2285
01:58:42,210 --> 01:58:44,440
During the marathon CA duty

2286
01:58:44,440 --> 01:58:46,840
something like this may happen...

2287
01:58:50,710 --> 01:58:52,810
Don't you want to kill that fly?

2288
01:58:52,110 --> 01:58:52,510
Yeah.

2289
01:58:52,940 --> 01:58:54,080
There was a fly.

2290
01:58:53,140 --> 01:58:56,080
A Fly in the Room

2291
01:58:54,880 --> 01:58:56,940
There was a big one.

2292
01:58:58,840 --> 01:59:00,110
It went there.

2293
01:58:59,740 --> 01:59:02,540
The 3 Juniors Trying To Kill The Fly

2294
01:59:00,710 --> 01:59:02,510
Can you really do it?

2295
01:59:03,610 --> 01:59:04,310
Here it is.

2296
01:59:04,310 --> 01:59:05,780
They're too old to be juniors.

2297
01:59:05,780 --> 01:59:06,940
Oh it stopped there.

2298
01:59:06,940 --> 01:59:08,210
It stopped. It stopped.

2299
01:59:08,340 --> 01:59:09,140
It's there.

2300
01:59:09,140 --> 01:59:10,110
Here's your chance, Tanaka.

2301
01:59:10,110 --> 01:59:11,710
Make sure to get it.  Make sure.

2302
01:59:14,440 --> 01:59:15,240
Got it?

2303
01:59:16,810 --> 01:59:20,380
An Object Fell on His Back

2304
01:59:25,440 --> 01:59:27,040
Something fell.

2305
01:59:27,040 --> 01:59:29,840
You can't be more clumsy than that!

2306
01:59:29,280 --> 01:59:31,440
It was like an American slapstick comedy.

2307
01:59:36,340 --> 01:59:37,180
Where's the fly?

2308
01:59:37,180 --> 01:59:37,640
No..

2309
01:59:38,010 --> 01:59:38,840
It escaped.

2310
01:59:40,140 --> 01:59:40,780
Damn.

2311
01:59:40,780 --> 01:59:42,280
But it's not flying.

2312
01:59:42,280 --> 01:59:42,840
OK.

2313
01:59:42,840 --> 01:59:44,010
As long as it's not flying, it's good.

2314
01:59:45,940 --> 01:59:49,280
Last time, we found something new (in drawers) when we returned.

2315
01:59:48,740 --> 01:59:49,280
Yes.

2316
01:59:53,880 --> 01:59:59,340
Something Found in the Drawer

2317
02:00:06,110 --> 02:00:07,010
Wait.

2318
02:00:07,980 --> 02:00:09,440
That's...

2319
02:00:12,140 --> 02:00:13,080
It must hurt!

2320
02:00:13,080 --> 02:00:14,680
It hurts..

2321
02:00:14,680 --> 02:00:16,380
Wait a second.

2322
02:00:16,380 --> 02:00:17,610
What is it?

2323
02:00:17,680 --> 02:00:19,610
Everyone take a look.

2324
02:00:25,140 --> 02:00:26,040
What's this..

2325
02:00:27,840 --> 02:00:45,410
Matsumoto Doll

2326
02:00:37,380 --> 02:00:38,640
It does look like you.

2327
02:00:42,640 --> 02:00:45,110
It means they added new items.

2328
02:00:43,940 --> 02:00:44,710
New items..

2329
02:00:45,710 --> 02:00:46,640
This is a new item.

2330
02:00:48,410 --> 02:00:51,580
It really looks like him.

2331
02:00:49,140 --> 02:00:57,980
Matsumoto Doll

2332
02:00:52,210 --> 02:00:52,840
See?

2333
02:00:53,580 --> 02:00:55,180
This is awesome.

2334
02:00:55,210 --> 02:00:56,340
It's really you.

2335
02:00:56,340 --> 02:00:57,810
This is really you!

2336
02:01:07,940 --> 02:01:10,340
No, you don't have to play with it so much.

2337
02:01:10,610 --> 02:01:11,280
Really.

2338
02:01:11,280 --> 02:01:13,780
Let me do a back flip.

2339
02:01:13,110 --> 02:01:13,940
Yeah.

2340
02:01:16,340 --> 02:01:19,340
You suck

2341
02:01:23,080 --> 02:01:24,510
You laughed.

2342
02:01:24,510 --> 02:01:25,340
You did.

2343
02:01:24,910 --> 02:01:26,840
Try it.  Show us how it's done

2344
02:01:26,880 --> 02:01:28,210
Wow.

2345
02:01:28,740 --> 02:01:32,040
It really looks like you.

2346
02:01:30,240 --> 02:01:31,410
I know it does!

2347
02:01:31,410 --> 02:01:32,340
This is awesome.

2348
02:01:34,010 --> 02:01:37,440
How do I do it?

2349
02:01:34,780 --> 02:01:37,440
I haven't done this for a year.

2350
02:01:47,410 --> 02:01:49,780
Hey wait!  No one else laughed but me!

2351
02:01:52,340 --> 02:01:54,280
What the hell!  I responded to your request!

2352
02:01:56,980 --> 02:01:58,140
It's hard to do, huh?

2353
02:01:59,440 --> 02:02:00,780
This is really..

2354
02:02:00,780 --> 02:02:01,840
The face.

2355
02:02:01,780 --> 02:02:03,710
It definitely looks like you

2356
02:02:02,880 --> 02:02:03,910
Awesome.

2357
02:02:04,110 --> 02:02:05,680
Everyone listen up.

2358
02:02:05,680 --> 02:02:09,340
Now, cabin attendants from our rival companies are here

2359
02:02:09,340 --> 02:02:11,980
for a joint training.  Let's attend it.

2360
02:02:12,540 --> 02:02:15,480
You are allowed to laugh during the training.

2361
02:02:16,510 --> 02:02:19,480
But if you lose to the other companies,

2362
02:02:19,840 --> 02:02:22,380
you'll receive a Thai-kick that you all hate.

2363
02:02:23,310 --> 02:02:24,440
No!

2364
02:02:23,310 --> 02:02:24,440
No!

2365
02:02:24,440 --> 02:02:26,310
I don't want it!

Shall we go then.

2369
02:02:28,310 --> 02:02:30,240
No way!

2370
02:02:30,240 --> 02:02:32,180
I can't take it more than once a day.

2371
02:02:32,180 --> 02:02:34,440
I got a fracture on my leg.

2372
02:02:34,710 --> 02:02:38,180
If I received Thai kicks several times,

2373
02:02:38,180 --> 02:02:40,380
it would cause a big problem for me.

2374
02:02:41,580 --> 02:02:47,080

Can we?

2378
02:02:52,840 --> 02:02:54,580
Yes, you can.

2379
02:02:54,580 --> 02:02:57,180
OK, start the music!

2380
02:02:58,710 --> 02:02:59,710

2589
02:10:08,080 --> 02:10:10,080
An Enka singer?

2590
02:10:08,080 --> 02:10:10,080
Enka...

2591
02:10:10,080 --> 02:10:11,910
What about the back members, Yamazaki-san?

2592
02:10:11,480 --> 02:10:14,880
Akiyoshi Kumiko

2593
02:10:16,080 --> 02:10:18,080
How about Hamada-san?

2594
02:10:18,080 --> 02:10:22,840
We were talking about who it would be.
I think Yamazaki stole our answer.

2595
02:10:25,480 --> 02:10:27,680
That's so embarrassing!

2596
02:10:27,910 --> 02:10:29,980
That will also be judged.

2597
02:10:30,440 --> 02:10:36,910
During the training, they are allowed to laugh.  However, the worst CA selected by the judges will receive a Thai-kick as a punishment

2598
02:10:31,080 --> 02:10:33,580
Were you listening in?

2599
02:10:31,080 --> 02:10:33,580
Yes, he was!

2600
02:10:33,580 --> 02:10:36,580
No, I didn't listen in!  Teacher!  Teacher!

2601
02:10:36,580 --> 02:10:40,580
What do you think about this?  Fujioka-san...

2602
02:10:40,040 --> 02:10:43,910
It's not good.  But it can't be helped.

2603
02:10:43,910 --> 02:10:47,240
He forgave it.

2604
02:10:47,740 --> 02:10:53,510
Asano Atsuko                Akino Yoko               Akimoto Junko              Anno Moyoko

2605
02:10:47,740 --> 02:10:53,510
Asano Yuko                   Aiko                        Aota Noriko                            Asaoka Ruriko

2606
02:10:47,740 --> 02:10:53,510
Celebrities whose Name Starts with A and End with Ko

2607
02:10:50,080 --> 02:10:52,580
Surprisingly, it seems to be OK with him.

2608
02:10:51,540 --> 02:10:52,710
Oh, that's good.

2609
02:10:52,980 --> 02:10:55,440
Next up is KimoITALIA Team.

2610
02:10:53,510 --> 02:10:56,610
1st ROUND                    KimoITALIA Airline

2611
02:10:55,480 --> 02:10:58,810
Question. Please answer within 10 seconds.

2612
02:10:59,040 --> 02:11:01,610
What are titles of single songs by SMAP.

2613
02:10:59,380 --> 02:11:15,010
Q: Title of a SMAP Hit Single

2614
02:11:02,080 --> 02:11:03,440
Here you go, start!

2615
02:11:03,510 --> 02:11:06,640
"The Only Flower in the World"

2616
02:11:08,740 --> 02:11:15,010
"Dynamite Honey"

2617
02:11:11,080 --> 02:11:13,580
"Gambarimasho"

2618
02:11:17,540 --> 02:11:21,080
What?  "Dynamite Honey"?  It's "Dynamite"!

2619
02:11:21,080 --> 02:11:23,080
There's a song like that, huh?

2620
02:11:23,080 --> 02:11:27,740
There are many.  Like "Gambarimasho", "KANSHA Shite" and "Lion Heart"

2621
02:11:23,740 --> 02:11:31,880
Ganbarimasho                          Lion Heart                           Aoi Inazuma

2622
02:11:23,740 --> 02:11:31,880
SMAP's Single Songs

02:11:23,740 --> 02:11:31,880
Yozora No Mukou                        $10                       Dangan Fighter

2624
02:11:28,580 --> 02:11:30,580
"Celery", "Celery"!

2625
02:11:30,580 --> 02:11:32,740
"Celery".  Yes, that's correct.  That's the answer.

2626
02:11:31,640 --> 02:11:33,140
There is really a lot.

2627
02:11:33,140 --> 02:11:35,580
Today's guests really suck.

2628
02:11:35,740 --> 02:11:40,110
You can't even reach the 3rd person.  Try harder.

2629
02:11:40,140 --> 02:11:41,480
Shall we move on to the 2nd round?

2630
02:11:41,480 --> 02:11:42,780
Let's move on.

2631
02:11:41,510 --> 02:11:43,810
2nd ROUND                      ONEAL FRANCE Airline

2632
02:11:42,810 --> 02:11:44,540
It's ONEALFRANCE Team!

2633
02:11:44,540 --> 02:11:45,340
Question.

2634
02:11:46,440 --> 02:11:49,980
Celebrity whose initial is T.Y.

2635
02:11:46,440 --> 02:12:05,810
Q: Celebrity whose initial is T.Y.

2636
02:11:49,410 --> 02:11:50,540
That's "T.Y."

2637
02:11:51,080 --> 02:11:54,580
Are you ready?  Here you go, start!

2638
02:11:54,810 --> 02:11:57,210
Tanaka Yuko

2639
02:11:57,210 --> 02:12:00,010
Takahashi Yoko

2640
02:12:00,010 --> 02:12:02,680
Tanaka Youji

2641
02:12:03,340 --> 02:12:04,140
There are men.

2642
02:12:04,740 --> 02:12:05,940
KABA-Chan!

2643
02:12:09,680 --> 02:12:13,080

02:12:09,810 --> 02:12:16,680
Toake Yukiyo          Tomita Yasuko          Takahashi Yumiko

2647
02:12:13,080 --> 02:12:16,080
Takeuchi Yuko as well.

2648
02:12:17,080 --> 02:12:20,480
Next up is CHUNENTAL Team.  Starting from Shohei-san.

2649
02:12:18,840 --> 02:12:21,780
2nd  ROUND                         CHUNENTAL Airline

2650
02:12:21,310 --> 02:12:25,410
What are titles of Japanese School Dramas?

2651
02:12:22,340 --> 02:12:49,780
Q: Titles of Japanese School Dramas

2652
02:12:26,580 --> 02:12:28,540
Are you OK?　Ready?

2653
02:12:28,340 --> 02:12:31,180
Like "Tobidase! Seishun"

2654
02:12:29,710 --> 02:12:31,180
Here you go.

2655
02:12:31,340 --> 02:12:35,510
"Tobidase! Seishun" is already said by Matsumoto-san, so don't use it.

2656
02:12:35,580 --> 02:12:39,580
Are you ready?  Here you go, start!

2657
02:12:40,040 --> 02:12:42,140
Taiyo...

2658
02:12:40,880 --> 02:12:42,140
Taiyo...

2659
02:12:42,140 --> 02:12:46,240
"Taiyo Ga Kureta Kisetsu"

2660
02:12:54,080 --> 02:12:56,580
This is your fault, Shohei-san.

2661
02:12:58,040 --> 02:13:00,580
That was no good.

2662
02:13:00,580 --> 02:13:03,080
Giving him so much time and ending up like that.

2663
02:13:03,080 --> 02:13:05,580
There's a lot more, huh.

2664
02:13:04,780 --> 02:13:08,540
Fujioka-san, isn't it very easy to give just one drama title?

2665
02:13:07,680 --> 02:13:08,580
Yeah.

2666
02:13:08,540 --> 02:13:11,710
Well, it's hard when I'm asked all of a sudden.

2667
02:13:10,080 --> 02:13:10,980
He couldn't!

2668
02:13:11,840 --> 02:13:14,080
Nothing!?

2669
02:13:14,080 --> 02:13:17,080
That's what they have to do in this game.

2670
02:13:17,080 --> 02:13:20,580
I think Kano Sisters got something.  Any school dramas that you can remember?

2671
02:13:20,580 --> 02:13:21,680
What about you?  Mika-san.

2672
02:13:21,580 --> 02:13:24,340
"Necchu Jidai" or...

2673
02:13:22,410 --> 02:13:23,540
"Necchu Jidai"  Right.

2674
02:13:24,710 --> 02:13:32,710
3-nen B-gumi              Kinpachi Sensei                Kyoshi Bin Bin Monogatari          Gokusen

2675
02:13:24,710 --> 02:13:32,710
Japanese School Dramas

2676
02:13:24,710 --> 02:13:32,710
Rookies                                    Hana Yori Dango                                     Water Boys

2677
02:13:25,080 --> 02:13:26,880
You couldn't you come up with even one?

2678
02:13:26,840 --> 02:13:28,240
I was panicking!

2679
02:13:28,480 --> 02:13:32,010
When one answer comes out, nothing more comes out.

2680
02:13:32,780 --> 02:13:38,410
Only Shohei-san keeps acting as a woman.

2681
02:13:39,080 --> 02:13:41,580
Thank you for your cooperation.

2682
02:13:43,040 --> 02:13:45,580
So now, next up is Gaasuu Team.

2683
02:13:44,740 --> 02:13:47,010
2nd ROUND       Gaasuukurobikari Airline System

2684
02:13:45,580 --> 02:13:46,880
Shall we start from Tanaka-san?

2685
02:13:48,340 --> 02:13:49,840
Question.　Answer within 10 seconds.

2686
02:13:49,980 --> 02:13:57,310
Name the celebrities whose names contain either Spring, Summer, Winter or Fall.

2687
02:13:50,210 --> 02:14:22,280
Q: Celebrities whose name contains either
Spring, Summer, Winter or Fall

2688
02:13:56,180 --> 02:13:59,580
Any of them can be included.  Everyone ready?

2689
02:14:00,480 --> 02:14:01,540
Start!

2690
02:14:01,580 --> 02:14:04,710
Kondo Haruna

2691
02:14:04,710 --> 02:14:07,780
Chiaki!

2692
02:14:07,780 --> 02:14:09,980
Natsuki Mari

2693
02:14:09,980 --> 02:14:12,640
Sakamoto Fuyumi

2694
02:14:12,640 --> 02:14:22,280
Aki Takejyo

2695
02:14:20,040 --> 02:14:23,540
Aki Takejyo... The Chinese character for her Aki doesn't mean Fall. Wrong!

2696
02:14:22,280 --> 02:14:24,610
Thai Kick!

2697
02:14:26,580 --> 02:14:28,510
What's going on?  Matsumoto-san.

2698
02:14:28,640 --> 02:14:31,810
"Sakamoto Fuyumi" was taken from me.

2699
02:14:35,210 --> 02:14:40,940
I've never thought I would fight over "Sakamoto Fuyumi" with my partner.

2700
02:14:41,010 --> 02:14:43,840
You've got plenty of time to think.  Please prepare at least 2 people.

2701
02:14:43,340 --> 02:14:50,180
Akimoto Yasushi                    Akino Taisaku               Moto Fuyuki

2704
02:14:45,580 --> 02:14:50,280
Hey, we still haven't seen a team clear everything within 10 seconds!

2705
02:14:50,380 --> 02:14:52,580
Next up is KimoITALIA Team.

2706
02:14:53,240 --> 02:14:54,640
From Fujimoto-san.

2707
02:14:53,540 --> 02:14:57,040
2nd Round                       KimoITALIA Team

2708
02:14:55,810 --> 02:14:56,480
Question.

2709
02:14:57,640 --> 02:15:15,310
Q:  Name the characters from "Kyojin no Hoshi"

2710
02:15:00,580 --> 02:15:05,580
Characters from "Kyojin no Hoshi".  I think the answers are limited.

2711
02:15:06,280 --> 02:15:06,910
Start!

2712
02:15:06,710 --> 02:15:08,710
Hoshi Ittetsu

2713
02:15:08,710 --> 02:15:11,110
Samon Hosaku

2714
02:15:11,110 --> 02:15:12,710
Hoshi Hyuma

2715
02:15:12,710 --> 02:15:13,780
Hanagata Mitsuru

2716
02:15:13,780 --> 02:15:15,310
Hoshi Akiko

2717
02:15:23,080 --> 02:15:24,980
KimoITALIA Team succeeded!

2718
02:15:25,140 --> 02:15:27,040
This is what I wanted to see!

2719
02:15:27,540 --> 02:15:28,710
Difficult, difficult!

2720
02:15:30,080 --> 02:15:33,510
Answer in 10 seconds!

2721
02:15:30,080 --> 02:15:33,510
CA Joint Training #1

2722
02:15:30,080 --> 02:15:33,510
FINISHED

2723
02:15:30,610 --> 02:15:32,580
This is the end of

2724
02:15:32,580 --> 02:15:33,880
"Let's answer in 10 seconds" game.

2725
02:15:34,580 --> 02:15:36,610
We did it!  We won!

2726
02:15:37,140 --> 02:15:39,610
Fujioka-san.  Who's answer was the worst?

2727
02:15:37,140 --> 02:15:43,280
The worst CA chosen by the judges will receive a Thai kick

2728
02:15:39,780 --> 02:15:41,410
Who's answer was the worst?

2729
02:15:41,410 --> 02:15:44,040
Which answer from Shohei-san was the worst?

2730
02:15:44,040 --> 02:15:47,040
It must be him.  It can only be him.

2731
02:15:47,040 --> 02:15:49,880
For 10 seconds it was only "Uh", "Ah".

2732
02:15:49,880 --> 02:15:52,810
All he did was get phlegm in his throat for 10 seconds.

2733
02:15:53,940 --> 02:15:57,180
But it might be someone you least expect.

2734
02:15:57,180 --> 02:16:00,180
I think it might surprise you, like "Is it me!?"

2735
02:16:00,340 --> 02:16:01,640
Fujioka-san is thinking hard

2736
02:16:03,680 --> 02:16:07,180
We thought it would be only one person.

2737
02:16:07,180 --> 02:16:11,040
Fujioka-san has someone in his mind.

2738
02:16:11,080 --> 02:16:13,580
Fujioka-san seems to have made up his mind.

2739
02:16:12,740 --> 02:16:14,940
Kyoko-san, what do you think about his opinion?

2740
02:16:15,010 --> 02:16:19,680
Mika-san and I have a different opinion.

2741
02:16:18,280 --> 02:16:20,480
So, let's make it two people instead.

2742
02:16:20,140 --> 02:16:24,610
2 CAs will receive Thai kick

2743
02:16:23,080 --> 02:16:26,680
OK, Chairman.  Please make your announcement!

2744
02:16:27,080 --> 02:16:32,080
Well, it is kind of... I feel a bit sorry.

2745
02:16:31,780 --> 02:16:34,740
I feel sorry after seeing the kick.

2746
02:16:34,740 --> 02:16:37,010
I feel bad.

2747
02:16:37,710 --> 02:16:39,410
Is it Endo-kun?

2748
02:16:41,540 --> 02:16:44,040
It can't possibly be me?

2749
02:16:48,080 --> 02:16:49,480
Really.  Today, I'm really kind of...

2750
02:16:49,480 --> 02:16:51,510
He used his ex wife's name and still,

2751
02:16:50,710 --> 02:16:51,510
That's right!

2752
02:16:52,080 --> 02:16:53,510
he was chosen somehow.

2753
02:16:53,780 --> 02:16:56,580
Endo-san OUT!

2754
02:16:57,710 --> 02:16:59,610
No way!

2755
02:16:59,610 --> 02:17:00,880
Serious?

2756
02:17:10,580 --> 02:17:13,240
This is gonna be really dangerous if you move.

2757
02:17:14,580 --> 02:17:17,080
Give me a count.

2758
02:17:17,080 --> 02:17:20,080
What should I do?  Can I stay still like this?

2759
02:17:35,710 --> 02:17:37,340
He's looking for the bathroom.

2760
02:17:37,640 --> 02:17:39,240
He's searching for the toilet.

2761
02:17:39,580 --> 02:17:41,610
This is no good!

2762
02:17:41,610 --> 02:17:44,080
My asshole is torn.

2763
02:17:45,140 --> 02:17:47,880
Shohei-san, let's go.

2764
02:17:48,110 --> 02:17:49,980
Who did Kano sisters choose?

2765
02:17:49,980 --> 02:17:54,310
We think it should be...

2766
02:17:52,910 --> 02:17:54,310
Yamazaki-san.

2767
02:17:54,310 --> 02:17:56,840
Don't go against the flow!

2768
02:17:56,840 --> 02:17:59,410
Don't go against the flow!

2769
02:18:01,780 --> 02:18:03,980
Wait!  Wait!  No!

2770
02:18:09,380 --> 02:18:11,980
Viewers must think of either of you two.

2771
02:18:16,540 --> 02:18:19,180
It can't be helped.   It's done.

2772
02:18:19,180 --> 02:18:22,610
I'll participate in a different scene later.

2773
02:18:22,610 --> 02:18:24,580
No, I'm serious.

2774
02:18:29,640 --> 02:18:31,280
Just hurry and do it.

2775
02:18:31,810 --> 02:18:35,010
Hey, no!  Wait!  Wait!

2776
02:18:35,340 --> 02:18:37,080
We still have a lot more to do.

2777
02:18:37,080 --> 02:18:38,880
So let's just get it done.  Please.

2778
02:18:38,910 --> 02:18:39,840
Stand up here.

2779
02:18:39,840 --> 02:18:41,680
It was decided already.

2780
02:18:41,840 --> 02:18:43,610
Takeda-san, please!

2781
02:18:43,610 --> 02:18:44,680
Please start!

2782
02:18:46,110 --> 02:18:48,580
Move your hand out of the way!

2783
02:18:53,440 --> 02:18:58,310
After this a shocking training will appear!!

2784
02:18:55,080 --> 02:18:58,310
Why did Yamazaki-san get chosen?

2785
02:18:58,880 --> 02:19:01,480
"Monmari Battle"!

2786
02:18:58,880 --> 02:19:01,480

Monmari Battle

2789
02:19:04,880 --> 02:19:10,340
For a CA who works in the sky for a long time, endurance is essential.

2790
02:19:06,080 --> 02:19:12,210
CA Joint Training #2

2791
02:19:06,080 --> 02:19:12,210

Monmari Battle

2793
02:19:10,540 --> 02:19:12,540
Patience.  This is hard.

2794
02:19:12,910 --> 02:19:19,380
2 members from each team become either an Answerer or a "Monmari"

Whoever gets two wrong answers receives an ass in the face punishment

2802
02:19:28,540 --> 02:19:31,740
If you lose, you will receive an embarrassing punishment.

2803
02:19:31,780 --> 02:19:38,680

Firstly...CHUNENTAL Airline VS KimoITALIA Airline.

2813
02:19:36,180 --> 02:19:38,810
Which team is going to win...?

2814
02:19:41,710 --> 02:19:44,380
You are eager to show your underwear.

2815
02:19:47,180 --> 02:19:49,640
Please sit with your rear end facing your opponent.

2816
02:19:50,580 --> 02:19:51,780
Please scoot up little bit.

2817
02:19:51,780 --> 02:19:54,210
I wonder what up with Seiji-kun's red underwear.

2818
02:19:56,580 --> 02:19:59,580
What a sight.

2819
02:19:59,580 --> 02:20:05,610
I don't like the line.  The middle line on the pants.

2820
02:20:05,610 --> 02:20:05,610
Everyone, are you ready?

2821
02:20:06,410 --> 02:20:08,180
His glasses might break.

2822
02:20:08,180 --> 02:20:10,580
Will they?

2823
02:20:11,540 --> 02:20:14,580
His glasses might break.  Well, let's see what happens.

2824
02:20:14,580 --> 02:20:15,440
Maomi-chan, let's start.

2825
02:20:15,510 --> 02:20:18,410
First question is...

2826
02:20:18,710 --> 02:20:20,780
Names of convenience stores.

2827
02:20:18,880 --> 02:20:57,280
Q:  Convenience Store Names

2828
02:20:21,140 --> 02:20:22,380
Eh, there aren't too many.

2829
02:20:22,580 --> 02:20:25,810
Are you ready?  Please name the convenience stores.

2830
02:20:26,840 --> 02:20:27,640
Start!

02:20:27,880 --> 02:20:30,280
Lawson

02:20:33,480 --> 02:20:37,240

2833
02:20:41,310 --> 02:20:42,040
Huh?

2834
02:20:45,580 --> 02:20:50,380
Let me think...Eh...

2835
02:20:50,380 --> 02:20:57,280
Monpari

2836
02:20:52,040 --> 02:20:55,080
Huh?  Monpari?

2837
02:20:55,080 --> 02:20:57,110
Alright!

2838
02:21:00,180 --> 02:21:08,040

Now since Shouhei-san couldn't answer correctly,

2842
02:21:06,740 --> 02:21:08,310
"Monmari" Start!

2843
02:21:08,310 --> 02:21:10,940
Monmari Starts!

2844
02:21:14,540 --> 02:21:16,780
It looks like it just wont stop.

2845
02:21:16,780 --> 02:21:18,780
It's coming toward you.

2846
02:21:18,780 --> 02:21:19,940
I hate it somehow.

2847
02:21:19,910 --> 02:21:22,310
Shohei-san is staring at it.

2848
02:21:23,480 --> 02:21:26,910
He's staring at you, Takeyama.

2849
02:21:26,910 --> 02:21:31,280
Shohei-san is staring at you.

2850
02:21:30,440 --> 02:21:32,180
He is being embarrassed.

2851
02:21:32,540 --> 02:21:35,040
Are you really embarrassed?

2852
02:21:33,410 --> 02:21:37,510
He didn't take off his glasses.

2853
02:21:37,510 --> 02:21:38,340
TO EXAMINE!

2854
02:21:38,340 --> 02:21:41,140

Shohei-san, there are more.

2870
02:22:22,110 --> 02:22:24,680
Let me think...

2871
02:22:25,480 --> 02:22:26,310
Huh?

2872
02:22:26,580 --> 02:22:28,980
Well...

2873
02:22:29,540 --> 02:22:31,580
Ahh!

2874
02:22:31,580 --> 02:22:33,010

Monmari is successfully completed.

2879
02:23:06,110 --> 02:23:08,980
Shohei-san, go get a Thai kick now.

2880
02:23:09,480 --> 02:23:11,110
Shohei-san, are you OK?

2881
02:23:13,080 --> 02:23:14,980
Go get a Thai kick now.

2882
02:23:15,040 --> 02:23:18,280
Shohei-san, you're not making sense, what's wrong?

2883
02:23:18,280 --> 02:23:19,540
He's grossed out.

2884
02:23:21,080 --> 02:23:21,880
Let's move on.

2885
02:23:22,010 --> 02:23:24,010

I'm afraid I might faint.

2907
02:23:54,740 --> 02:23:57,740
It's like full anesthesia.

02:23:57,880 --> 02:23:59,510
How much can he bear..

2909
02:23:59,510 --> 02:24:00,580
No No No!

2910
02:24:01,010 --> 02:24:02,480

HEY WAIT A MINUTE!!

2913
02:24:16,540 --> 02:24:20,980
That underwear looks like it has been worn for four seasons.

2914
02:24:24,840 --> 02:24:27,180
It must have been worn for quite a long time.

2915
02:24:28,580 --> 02:24:30,940
Since when did you become such a person, Majima-san?

2916
02:24:30,910 --> 02:24:32,510
I'm embarrassed

2917
02:24:33,640 --> 02:24:37,080
That's our line.   We are embarrassed.

2918
02:24:37,080 --> 02:24:38,580

2933
02:25:08,740 --> 02:25:10,510
"Carmen"...

2934
02:25:10,510 --> 02:25:12,610
That's right, "Carmen'77".

2935
02:25:14,010 --> 02:25:15,810
Now, please start!

2936
02:25:24,380 --> 02:25:26,480
Wow.  This is so exciting!

2937
02:25:30,780 --> 02:25:31,940
Yes, Matsumoto-san?

2938
02:25:33,110 --> 02:25:36,610
In the very middle, I see a little bulge sticking out.

2939
02:25:37,580 --> 02:25:39,540
I'm not joking.  See?

2940
02:25:39,540 --> 02:25:40,980
There's something there, right?

2941
02:25:42,310 --> 02:25:43,710
What is it?

2942
02:25:43,880 --> 02:25:44,980
Just some material.

2943
02:25:44,980 --> 02:25:47,180
Something is sticking out!

2944
02:25:47,180 --> 02:25:49,780
SOMETHING IS STICKING OUT!

2945
02:25:50,040 --> 02:25:52,040
That's nothing.  On to the question.

2946
02:25:52,080 --> 02:25:53,440
Question.

2947
02:25:53,810 --> 02:25:56,380
Famous celebrity Trios

2948
02:25:54,110 --> 02:26:34,680
Q: Famous Celebrity Trios

2949
02:25:56,310 --> 02:25:58,110
Celebrity Trios!

2950
02:25:58,110 --> 02:26:00,180
Start!

2951

Let's Go Sanbiki.

Tokyo 03

2954
02:26:10,910 --> 02:26:13,410
Neptune

2955
02:26:13,510 --> 02:26:14,780
Eh?  Eh?  Eh?

2956
02:26:14,780 --> 02:26:17,080
There's a lot more you should know.

2957
02:26:16,480 --> 02:26:17,640
Ah!  Ah!

2958
02:26:24,310 --> 02:26:27,380
Eh?  Eh?  Wait...

2959
02:26:27,380 --> 02:26:29,110
Matsumoto-san is in a pinch!

2960
02:26:29,110 --> 02:26:32,580
Wait.  Trio.  I know there is a trio...

2961
02:26:35,080 --> 02:26:37,540
That was too bad.

2962
02:26:37,540 --> 02:26:39,840
Here we go.

2963
02:26:39,840 --> 02:26:41,480
Start!

2964
02:26:47,080 --> 02:26:48,240
Here we go.

2965
02:26:48,240 --> 02:26:49,710
Start!

2966
02:27:00,540 --> 02:27:03,110
Now.  Amano-san...

2967
02:27:09,580 --> 02:27:10,940
One more time!

2968
02:27:15,080 --> 02:27:18,310
Matsumoto-san, how about another go?

2969
02:27:17,040 --> 02:27:18,210
ENOUGH!

2970
02:27:18,380 --> 02:27:21,540
I wonder if this works.  Refill time!

2971
02:27:26,710 --> 02:27:27,880
Congratulations!

2972
02:27:37,540 --> 02:27:39,580
Matsumoto-san.

2973
02:27:40,040 --> 02:27:45,380
It's sad.  It smelled like soap.

2974
02:27:46,780 --> 02:27:49,280
It made me feel sad.

2975
02:27:49,540 --> 02:27:51,540
Majima-san.  How do you feel?

2976
02:27:50,740 --> 02:27:52,210
It feels good

2977
02:27:56,080 --> 02:28:00,040
Now all the trainings are finished.

Congratulations!

2988
02:28:10,810 --> 02:28:15,840
What about finishing this training with a Thai kick?

2989
02:28:17,140 --> 02:28:19,580
Did you find anyone that was just bad all around?

2990
02:28:20,940 --> 02:28:25,710
Since I'm impressed with their comedian souls, no punishment for this time!

2991
02:28:24,880 --> 02:28:25,640
No punishment!

2992
02:28:25,710 --> 02:28:31,310
He Ignores The Obvious!

2993
02:28:28,040 --> 02:28:31,040
He's kind!  He's kind!

2994
02:28:31,040 --> 02:28:32,710
So kind!

2995
02:28:32,510 --> 02:28:34,110
He is not for variety shows!

2996
02:28:36,580 --> 02:28:40,040
5 Hours Since The Start

2997
02:28:40,680 --> 02:28:45,480
Arriving back at the training room, they are having some snacks.

2998
02:28:47,210 --> 02:28:48,610
I'm getting tired.

2999
02:28:51,280 --> 02:28:53,780
What Matsumoto is holding is...

3000
02:28:53,880 --> 02:28:56,980
Chocolate Baumkuchen from the fridge.

3001
02:28:57,380 --> 02:29:03,280
Fake Baumkuchen made of hard material

3002
02:28:57,540 --> 02:29:01,880
In fact, it made of hard inedible material.

3003
02:29:02,440 --> 02:29:03,580
A fake.

3004
02:29:22,110 --> 02:29:25,910
Something Found In The Drawer

3005
02:29:31,210 --> 02:29:38,340
Downtown Dolls

3006
02:29:35,380 --> 02:29:36,180
It's a pair.

3007
02:29:36,640 --> 02:29:37,440
It's a pair.

3008
02:29:40,040 --> 02:29:42,540
Matsumoto looks more realistic.

3009
02:29:44,080 --> 02:29:48,580
I'm sorry to ask you this now, but has anyone tried eating this?

3010
02:29:49,640 --> 02:29:51,380
No, I didn't

3011
02:29:49,640 --> 02:29:51,380
No, I didn't

3012
02:29:51,640 --> 02:29:54,110
Can you get one from the fridge and try eating it?

3013
02:29:55,040 --> 02:29:57,040
Huh, why?

3014
02:29:57,440 --> 02:29:58,310
Why is it?

02:29:59,810 --> 02:30:01,380
Try it.

3020
02:30:06,540 --> 02:30:08,040
This.

3021
02:30:08,380 --> 02:30:11,680
At the time I wasn't too sure yet.

3022
02:30:11,680 --> 02:30:14,310
I still didn't know what it actually was.

3023
02:30:14,310 --> 02:30:15,440
I see.

3024
02:30:26,680 --> 02:30:28,410
What is this?

3025
02:30:30,510 --> 02:30:31,580
What is it?

3026
02:30:31,610 --> 02:30:32,680
What is it?

3027
02:30:32,840 --> 02:30:33,940
What is it?

3028
02:30:35,610 --> 02:30:38,040
Hey wait a minute.

3029
02:30:40,510 --> 02:30:43,240
What is it?
I can't bite it.

3030
02:30:43,480 --> 02:30:44,780
Isn't this fake?

3031
02:30:45,040 --> 02:30:47,040
This is a sponge right?

3032
02:30:47,040 --> 02:30:49,540
Huh?  Who would do that?

3033
02:30:49,540 --> 02:30:51,180
Isn't it something like...

3034
02:30:51,180 --> 02:30:52,980
food sample?

3035
02:30:53,040 --> 02:30:55,380
Yeah.

3036
02:30:53,040 --> 02:30:55,380
Yeah.

3037
02:30:55,510 --> 02:30:58,740
This is getting to be really

3038
02:30:56,980 --> 02:30:58,710
malicious.

3039
02:30:58,710 --> 02:31:00,780
That's what it is.

3040
02:31:00,510 --> 02:31:02,480
This is not "no-laughing".

3041
02:31:02,480 --> 02:31:03,410
Yeah.

3042
02:31:12,480 --> 02:31:16,440
At GAS, not only to take care of inquiries from our customers,

3043
02:31:16,440 --> 02:31:22,480
but also to create a good working environment for our employees, we set up a general call center.

3044
02:31:20,440 --> 02:31:21,280
Here it comes.

3045
02:31:21,280 --> 02:31:22,080
Here it comes.

3046
02:31:22,340 --> 02:31:23,380
Finally.

3047
02:31:23,610 --> 02:31:24,710
It came.

3048
02:31:24,710 --> 02:31:29,810
Let's take a look at a day at the call center.

3049
02:31:30,140 --> 02:31:32,580
Receptionist

3050
02:31:36,340 --> 02:31:36,340
Sato Mina

3051
02:31:36,340 --> 02:31:36,340
This time we get assistance from Sato san and

3052
02:31:36,340 --> 02:31:37,810
Ohnishi Hideko san.

3053
02:31:36,340 --> 02:31:40,340
Ohnishi Hideko

3054
02:31:36,340 --> 02:31:40,340
Receptionist

3055
02:31:46,080 --> 02:31:46,510
Hello.

3056
02:31:46,580 --> 02:31:48,840
This is the general call center.

3057
02:31:48,840 --> 02:31:50,010
How may I help you?

3058
02:31:50,240 --> 02:31:51,980
(Foreigner) I lost my baggage.
-Huh?

3059
02:31:51,980 --> 02:31:53,780
(Foreigner) What should I do?

3060
02:31:55,380 --> 02:31:56,410
Roast?

3061
02:31:59,510 --> 02:32:00,080
Well..

3062
02:32:00,780 --> 02:32:03,710
Ro...Ro...

3063
02:32:05,410 --> 02:32:09,140
Oh.  Would you prefer chicken?

3064
02:32:09,140 --> 02:32:11,880
I'll switch to chicken.

3065
02:32:13,580 --> 02:32:16,380
I'll switch to chicken.

3066
02:32:20,880 --> 02:32:22,880
I tried not to...

3067
02:32:23,980 --> 02:32:25,380
He's unbelievable.

3068
02:32:25,680 --> 02:32:27,240
Wait a second.

3069
02:32:31,480 --> 02:32:33,810
This guy is going to be killer.

3070
02:32:32,910 --> 02:32:36,440
As soon as this started, I...

3071
02:32:34,380 --> 02:32:35,110
I think so.

3072
02:32:35,210 --> 02:32:38,810
Endo and Yamazaki are so weak.

3073
02:32:39,380 --> 02:32:42,680
(Foreigner) I said I lost my baggage.  Do you understand?

3074
02:32:43,140 --> 02:32:47,440
Yes!  Well... I do understand.

3075
02:32:47,640 --> 02:32:49,440
(Foreigner) Tell me what I meant then.

3076
02:32:50,410 --> 02:32:58,510
Well...

3077
02:32:52,240 --> 02:32:58,510
Let me think....

3078
02:32:54,280 --> 02:32:58,510
In the baggage...

3079
02:32:55,680 --> 02:32:58,510
Well...

3080
02:32:56,680 --> 02:32:58,510
Well...

3081
02:32:58,610 --> 02:33:05,240
Like crispy chicken...

3082
02:33:00,080 --> 02:33:05,240
Well...

3083
02:33:01,110 --> 02:33:05,240
Well...

3084
02:33:03,140 --> 02:33:05,240
Potato...

3085
02:33:03,810 --> 02:33:05,240
And potatoes...

3086
02:33:05,540 --> 02:33:12,410
Well...

3087
02:33:07,410 --> 02:33:12,410
Well...

3088
02:33:08,840 --> 02:33:12,410
Pickles...

3089
02:33:10,410 --> 02:33:12,410
Do...

3090
02:33:11,440 --> 02:33:12,410
gs and something...

3091
02:33:12,410 --> 02:33:14,880
stabbed with food picks.

3092
02:33:15,110 --> 02:33:19,440
A little bit of...

3093
02:33:15,810 --> 02:33:19,440
pickolos...

3094
02:33:16,810 --> 02:33:17,880
Pickolos?

3095
02:33:16,880 --> 02:33:19,440
Well...

3096
02:33:17,410 --> 02:33:19,440
That's all in that.

3097
02:33:21,880 --> 02:33:24,240
It doesn't make any sense!

3098
02:33:25,880 --> 02:33:27,440
What the hell are pickoles?

3099
02:33:28,580 --> 02:33:29,810
I tried hard not to laugh...

3100
02:33:29,410 --> 02:33:29,840
Ouch!

3101
02:33:32,080 --> 02:33:33,380
I tried not to...

3102
02:33:33,380 --> 02:33:37,010
Pickles

3103
02:33:35,080 --> 02:33:36,980
or

3104
02:33:35,740 --> 02:33:36,980
dogs

3105
02:33:37,010 --> 02:33:39,380
Stuff stabbed with food picks.

3106
02:33:39,780 --> 02:33:41,080
What?

3107
02:33:39,840 --> 02:33:44,610
A little bit of

3108
02:33:39,880 --> 02:33:44,610
pickolos

3109
02:33:41,580 --> 02:33:44,610
Well...

3110
02:33:41,980 --> 02:33:44,610
That's all in that.

3111
02:33:42,610 --> 02:33:44,680
Stuff stabbed with food picks..

3112
02:33:43,840 --> 02:33:46,040
(Foreigner) That's enough.  You are useless!

3113
02:33:46,240 --> 02:33:49,080
Normally

3114
02:33:46,910 --> 02:33:49,080
I

3115
02:33:47,310 --> 02:33:49,080
I...

3116
02:33:47,740 --> 02:33:49,080
Ah.

3117
02:33:52,640 --> 02:33:54,110
Tough job, huh?

3118
02:33:54,910 --> 02:33:57,680
We get a lot of different things happening here.

3119
02:34:07,240 --> 02:34:10,440
Hello.  This is the general call center.

3120
02:34:10,680 --> 02:34:11,680
How may I help you?

3121
02:34:11,880 --> 02:34:15,980
(Newbie CA) I'm going to graduate from junior collage this year,

3122
02:34:11,880 --> 02:34:15,980
and start working as CA next year.

3123
02:34:15,980 --> 02:34:16,380

3124
02:34:16,380 --> 02:34:18,840
(Newbie CA) Please teach me 3 must-dos for CA.

3125
02:34:18,840 --> 02:34:23,280
Yes!

3126
02:34:20,380 --> 02:34:23,280
So

3127
02:34:21,640 --> 02:34:23,280
Please let me tell you now.

3128
02:34:23,280 --> 02:34:25,280
Thank you.

3129
02:34:26,480 --> 02:34:34,510
Number 1.

3130
02:34:30,610 --> 02:34:34,510
You have to come flying.

3131
02:34:36,180 --> 02:34:39,210
You have to come flying.

3132
02:34:39,910 --> 02:34:41,580
Doesn't make sense.  Seriously.

3133
02:34:43,910 --> 02:34:46,440
What the hell is he talking about?

3134
02:34:46,440 --> 02:34:48,210
What is he saying?

3135
02:34:53,010 --> 02:34:54,380
That was great!

3136
02:34:59,380 --> 02:35:01,710
How can you be so patient?

3137
02:35:03,680 --> 02:35:12,380
Number 1.

3138
02:35:07,780 --> 02:35:12,380
You have to come flying.

3139
02:35:12,480 --> 02:35:21,680
Number 2.

3140
02:35:16,940 --> 02:35:21,680
You shouldn't bump.

3141
02:35:22,710 --> 02:35:24,940
You shouldn't bump.

3142
02:35:29,380 --> 02:35:31,410
Hey wait.  What the hell is he?

3143
02:35:31,980 --> 02:35:33,410
What?  What?

3144
02:35:32,210 --> 02:35:34,480
What is he thinking?

3145
02:35:33,510 --> 02:35:35,410
I don't know!

3146
02:35:34,480 --> 02:35:36,480
He's thinking of something else?

3147
02:35:40,380 --> 02:35:41,880
What is he thinking of?

3148
02:35:40,840 --> 02:35:42,410
Please stop it!

3149
02:35:42,940 --> 02:35:52,140
Number 2.

3150
02:35:47,310 --> 02:35:52,140
You shouldn't bump.

3151
02:35:50,480 --> 02:35:53,380
What does he mean?

3152
02:35:52,140 --> 02:36:04,210
Number 3.

3153
02:36:00,640 --> 02:36:04,210
You shouldn't spill over.

3154
02:36:09,980 --> 02:36:11,880
Hey.  Wait a second!

3155
02:36:12,180 --> 02:36:14,210
I guess I laughed, huh!

3156
02:36:14,710 --> 02:36:16,110
So you...

3157
02:36:16,110 --> 02:36:17,310
This is tough.

3158
02:36:17,780 --> 02:36:20,410
Tough.

3159
02:36:19,380 --> 02:36:20,410
Tough.

3160
02:36:20,410 --> 02:36:22,510
This is scary.  I hope this will end soon.

3161
02:36:22,180 --> 02:36:24,580
Look carefully when you hit.  Damn!

3162
02:36:24,580 --> 02:36:27,410
(Newbie CA)  Understood.  That's enough.

3163
02:36:27,410 --> 02:36:29,110
Oh..Thank you

3164
02:36:29,040 --> 02:36:33,110
for your politeness...

3165
02:36:29,440 --> 02:36:30,510
She was pissed.

3166
02:36:30,180 --> 02:36:33,110
We...

3167
02:36:31,210 --> 02:36:33,110
Well

3168
02:36:31,510 --> 02:36:33,110
See you again...

3169
02:36:32,140 --> 02:36:33,110
Ah...

3170
02:36:36,810 --> 02:36:40,440
A day in the call center will be continued...

3171
02:36:41,310 --> 02:36:42,380
To be continued.

3172
02:36:42,010 --> 02:36:43,410
This is not finished yet.

3173
02:36:42,980 --> 02:36:44,710
Huh?  What..

3174
02:36:42,980 --> 02:36:44,710
Huh?  What..

3175
02:36:46,840 --> 02:36:49,480
My butt reached has reached it's limit...

3176
02:36:51,380 --> 02:36:54,380
5 hours and 30 minutes since the start of the duty.

3177
02:36:54,380 --> 02:36:59,840
There is a serious situation for Matsumoto who has a problem with his knee.

3178
02:37:00,810 --> 02:37:02,840
Hey.  Can I take a leak?

3179
02:37:03,080 --> 02:37:04,710
Did you bring it?

3180
02:37:03,080 --> 02:37:09,440
*Their training room is on the 3rd floor. They must go down the stairs to the 1st floor restroom.

3181
02:37:09,440 --> 02:37:10,680
This is portable.

3182
02:37:10,380 --> 02:37:15,510
Portable Toilet Prepared By Staff

3183
02:37:10,680 --> 02:37:11,510
Is that it?

3184
02:37:11,640 --> 02:37:13,040
It's for the car.

3185
02:37:13,180 --> 02:37:15,040
Go outside.

3186
02:37:17,340 --> 02:37:19,380
Hey.  Go outside and do it.

3187
02:37:19,380 --> 02:37:20,840
There's another room .

3188
02:37:20,840 --> 02:37:21,480
Yes.

3189
02:37:21,480 --> 02:37:23,180
Could you go somewhere people are not around?

3190
02:37:23,180 --> 02:37:24,680
This room is for everyone to relax.

3191
02:37:24,680 --> 02:37:25,410
Yeah.

3192
02:37:25,410 --> 02:37:26,340
This is our relaxing room.

3193
02:37:26,340 --> 02:37:26,680
Yes.

3194
02:37:28,280 --> 02:37:30,580
No.  Let me do it in the corner here.

3195
02:37:31,410 --> 02:37:32,940
There's another room next to this room.

3196
02:37:32,940 --> 02:37:33,610
Yes, the next door.

3197
02:37:33,780 --> 02:37:37,380
Isn't it better if I'm here just in case something funny happens?

3198
02:37:39,640 --> 02:37:40,410
It's OK.

3199
02:37:40,410 --> 02:37:41,610
Nah, that's fine.

3200
02:37:41,610 --> 02:37:42,410
There wont be anything.

3201
02:37:45,380 --> 02:37:50,510
Matsumoto Leaves To The Smoking Room Alone

3202
02:37:54,010 --> 02:37:58,740
Begins To Make Traps For Matsumoto

3203
02:37:54,380 --> 02:37:55,380
Keep an eye out for him.

3204
02:38:01,110 --> 02:38:03,580
Wow.  It smells like cigarettes!

3205
02:38:04,740 --> 02:38:06,280
Why did you get out?

3206
02:38:07,180 --> 02:38:09,080
He didn't like the smell.

3207
02:38:09,080 --> 02:38:11,080
Oh!  Stop stop atop!

3208
02:38:18,710 --> 02:38:20,410
What the hell are you guys doing!

3209
02:38:20,410 --> 02:38:23,280
Why everyone...

3210
02:38:22,880 --> 02:38:24,410
Why everyone?

3211
02:38:24,480 --> 02:38:26,110
It was too fast to return.

3212
02:38:27,280 --> 02:38:28,780
The room was so stinky.

3213
02:38:29,580 --> 02:38:31,280
My butt is beginning to hurt.

3214
02:38:31,280 --> 02:38:32,040
Mine too.

3215
02:38:32,340 --> 02:38:33,680
Hey what are you doing?

3216
02:38:33,680 --> 02:38:36,580
I went to the room, but it smelled like cigarettes.

3217
02:38:36,940 --> 02:38:38,110
Is there..

3218
02:38:38,110 --> 02:38:40,780
I can't do it in such a place.  No, I can't.

3219
02:38:40,780 --> 02:38:44,010
But don't do it in here.

3220
02:38:42,410 --> 02:38:44,080
Doesn't have to be here does it?

3221
02:38:44,080 --> 02:38:45,980
What about hallway?

3222
02:38:47,110 --> 02:38:50,580
No way, man.  I thought I was more decent than that.

3223
02:38:50,580 --> 02:38:56,440
I've been trying hard in this field since I started at 18.

3224
02:38:56,440 --> 02:39:02,880
Now, before turning 50, I don't want to be forced to take a piss in the hallway.

3225
02:39:07,280 --> 02:39:08,080
Too long!

3226
02:39:10,380 --> 02:39:12,380
But it's true.

3227
02:39:12,380 --> 02:39:14,380
It's a different story.

3228
02:39:14,380 --> 02:39:15,880
No, it's not!

3229
02:39:14,710 --> 02:39:16,340
It can't be helped!

3230
02:39:21,180 --> 02:39:22,440
But...

3231
02:39:22,440 --> 02:39:26,740
Anywhere else but this room, please.

3232
02:39:24,280 --> 02:39:25,740
Yeah.

3233
02:39:26,110 --> 02:39:26,880
Yes.

3234
02:39:26,880 --> 02:39:30,040
It sounds a little bit lonely.

3235
02:39:29,380 --> 02:39:30,410
What.. Lonely?

3236
02:39:30,040 --> 02:39:32,640
I want to do it where people are around.

3237
02:39:33,040 --> 02:39:34,610
That's wrong.

3238
02:39:35,210 --> 02:39:38,680
OK then, the recessed space is fine.

3239
02:39:37,710 --> 02:39:39,410
Hey hey hey hey!!

3240
02:39:39,410 --> 02:39:40,840
What the hell are you doing?

3241
02:39:41,740 --> 02:39:44,340
Hey hey hey!

3242
02:39:41,740 --> 02:39:44,340
No no no!

3243
02:39:44,340 --> 02:39:45,510
Let's go outside.

3244
02:39:45,840 --> 02:39:47,380
Let's go outside.

3245
02:39:47,510 --> 02:39:49,810
Don't act like an old man making excuses.

3246
02:39:49,780 --> 02:39:51,010
OUCH!  OUCH!

3247
02:39:50,310 --> 02:39:51,310
No it doesn't hurt.

3248
02:39:51,410 --> 02:39:52,280
No it doesn't.

3249
02:39:52,280 --> 02:39:53,940
Don't play dumb.

3250
02:39:53,940 --> 02:39:56,310
You're trying to make traps while I'm gone!

3251
02:39:55,840 --> 02:39:56,680
No way!

3252
02:39:56,840 --> 02:39:57,910
No we won't.

3253
02:40:00,740 --> 02:40:03,240
You can do it there!

3254
02:40:01,740 --> 02:40:02,410
Can I watch here?

3255
02:40:02,410 --> 02:40:03,780
Yes you can.

3256
02:40:05,840 --> 02:40:11,640
Again Starting To Make Traps

3257
02:40:09,680 --> 02:40:10,840
In the drawer.

3258
02:40:12,380 --> 02:40:14,310
You can put in there too.

3259
02:40:14,340 --> 02:40:16,210
Put them all.  Put them all!

3260
02:40:17,140 --> 02:40:18,740
All of them!

3261
02:40:28,240 --> 02:40:31,740
I could see everything.  Also heard you said " Put them all!'.

3262
02:40:31,740 --> 02:40:34,310
I first thought you were talking about this.

3263
02:40:41,480 --> 02:40:44,510
Why would I tell you to put them all in there..

3264
02:40:44,510 --> 02:40:46,010
All...

3265
02:40:50,840 --> 02:40:53,780
I thought you were talking to me like casual friends.

3266
02:40:53,780 --> 02:40:55,310
OK then, I'll do it here.

3267
02:40:57,580 --> 02:40:58,880
Hey wait.

3268
02:41:04,740 --> 02:41:07,810
Is it possible to get only "it" outside?

3269
02:41:06,940 --> 02:41:08,080
Huh?  What do you mean?

3270
02:41:09,580 --> 02:41:12,140
From in between the door...

3271
02:41:12,140 --> 02:41:15,810
This is what a pervert would do.

3272
02:41:20,380 --> 02:41:22,880
I've had it!

3273
02:41:23,410 --> 02:41:24,740
Hey!

3274
02:41:24,740 --> 02:41:26,240
I've had enough..

3275
02:41:25,310 --> 02:41:26,880
Give me a break..

3276
02:41:26,540 --> 02:41:28,440
It hurts anyway.

3277
02:41:29,410 --> 02:41:32,640
No, I'm not trying to be mean or anything.

3278
02:41:32,640 --> 02:41:36,910
I just simply want to

3279
02:41:34,380 --> 02:41:36,910
take a piss.

3280
02:41:36,880 --> 02:41:37,510
That's rght.

3281
02:41:37,140 --> 02:41:39,740
What shall we do?

3282
02:41:40,940 --> 02:41:43,380
Your concern is the smell right?

3283
02:41:43,340 --> 02:41:45,810
Yes.  The smell and sound.

3284
02:41:45,880 --> 02:41:48,740
It's really disgusting.

3285
02:41:50,080 --> 02:41:52,610
The piss of a 50 year old man, right?

3286
02:41:51,540 --> 02:41:52,610
It's dirty.

3287
02:41:52,640 --> 02:41:56,180
I'm not 50 yet.  I'm still 48..

3288
02:41:56,180 --> 02:41:59,180
I am not a 50 year old man.

3289
02:41:59,980 --> 02:42:02,140
What about my idea?

3290
02:42:02,610 --> 02:42:04,010
Let his body stay here...

3291
02:42:05,510 --> 02:42:08,480
Let Matsumoto-san's body stay here and..

3292
02:42:08,610 --> 02:42:11,180
Here it comes.  The Pervert Plan.

3293
02:42:11,180 --> 02:42:15,610
We can't compromise more than this.

3294
02:42:13,980 --> 02:42:15,480
You know what.

3295
02:42:15,880 --> 02:42:23,640
I'll be here in this room, leaving my penis outside while wearing a female costume.

3296
02:42:27,340 --> 02:42:28,540
That's true.

3297
02:42:30,080 --> 02:42:35,910
Matsumoto-san.  All you have to do is just quickly go outside and do it!

3298
02:42:40,580 --> 02:42:42,540
He's strange.

3299
02:42:42,540 --> 02:42:46,110
What about inside out?

3300
02:42:45,680 --> 02:42:46,740
Huh?

3301
02:42:46,840 --> 02:42:54,110
I go outside and leave my penis inside.

3302
02:42:57,080 --> 02:42:58,310
It doesn't make sense!

3303
02:42:59,440 --> 02:43:00,880
Hey you!

3304
02:43:00,880 --> 02:43:05,440
It's gonna hurt as I'm not wearing my underwear.

3305
02:43:08,110 --> 02:43:11,680
Isn't it much better to have his body inside?

3306
02:43:13,480 --> 02:43:16,540
I wonder if I can take a piss like that.

3307
02:43:21,540 --> 02:43:24,080
Do you have to pull it all the way down?

3308
02:43:26,980 --> 02:43:29,380
Do you have to expose your ass?

3309
02:43:29,740 --> 02:43:32,280
You can pull down only the front.

3310
02:43:32,280 --> 02:43:35,380
I don't want you to pull it down so much.

3311
02:43:37,480 --> 02:43:39,540
This is an awful scene.

3312
02:43:40,010 --> 02:43:42,340
He's a super pervert.

3313
02:43:42,880 --> 02:43:45,310
This is wrong, right?

3314
02:43:45,310 --> 02:43:47,640
This is definitely wrong, right?

3315
02:43:51,080 --> 02:43:53,480
Give me a break!

3316
02:43:55,580 --> 02:43:57,010
Hey!

3317
02:43:57,010 --> 02:43:59,010
I can't.  I can't.

3318
02:44:00,610 --> 02:44:02,180
I can't.  I can't.

3319
02:44:02,180 --> 02:44:04,980
You can watch us from the window.

3320
02:44:05,140 --> 02:44:08,040
We will be just sitting here.

3321
02:44:07,610 --> 02:44:08,180
Yes.

3322
02:44:08,180 --> 02:44:11,610
We will be sitting without doing anything else. So don't worry.

3323
02:44:16,940 --> 02:44:19,680
He's watching

3324
02:44:20,210 --> 02:44:21,910
He's closing his eyes.

3325
02:44:22,080 --> 02:44:24,680
He wouldn't bring it back, would he?

3326
02:44:24,680 --> 02:44:27,480
If he does, please dump it asap.  OK, Endo?

3327
02:44:27,480 --> 02:44:29,580
No way!

3328
02:44:29,580 --> 02:44:31,280
Look!  Look!  Look!

3329
02:44:32,410 --> 02:44:33,140
Ugh..

3330
02:44:33,280 --> 02:44:34,440
No no no!

3331
02:44:34,440 --> 02:44:37,780
It's already solid. Try touching it.

3332
02:44:37,040 --> 02:44:38,810
No, I don't want.

3333
02:44:37,780 --> 02:44:40,510
Try touching it.

3334
02:44:40,510 --> 02:44:41,480
I'm serious.

3335
02:44:41,480 --> 02:44:42,780
It's your piss right?

3336
02:44:42,080 --> 02:44:43,440
What are you doing?

3337
02:44:43,440 --> 02:44:44,740
What the hell are you doing?

3338
02:44:44,840 --> 02:44:45,940
Watch out!

3339
02:44:45,940 --> 02:44:48,380
Let's stop it.

3340
02:44:48,380 --> 02:44:49,480
No way!

3341
02:44:49,540 --> 02:44:51,280
Cut it out seriously!

3342
02:44:51,280 --> 02:44:53,840
STOP IT REALLY!

3343
02:45:00,010 --> 02:45:00,810
What are you doing!

3344
02:45:00,810 --> 02:45:02,610
What's wrong with you!

3345
02:45:02,610 --> 02:45:04,440
It's your piss!

3346
02:45:11,310 --> 02:45:12,910
No no..

3347
02:45:13,410 --> 02:45:17,410
This is solid, so you don't have to worry.  I'm serious.

3348
02:45:21,840 --> 02:45:23,710
We'll take your word for it

3349
02:45:23,710 --> 02:45:25,710
It's solid.  Seriously.

3350
02:45:24,810 --> 02:45:26,180
If you say so..

3351
02:45:26,180 --> 02:45:28,910
I'm sorry but this is how I have to do it.

3352
02:45:28,910 --> 02:45:30,980
It can't be helped.

3353
02:45:30,740 --> 02:45:31,680
Please dump it

3354
02:45:31,910 --> 02:45:32,780
Are you telling me?

3355
02:45:32,780 --> 02:45:34,240
Yes.

3356
02:45:35,580 --> 02:45:38,740
Grabs The Dirtiest Part

3357
02:45:38,180 --> 02:45:39,310
That's right, Endo.

3358
02:45:39,880 --> 02:45:41,280
That's the dirtiest part!

3359
02:45:40,240 --> 02:45:41,280
I'll take that

3360
02:45:41,280 --> 02:45:41,980
You're right!

3361
02:45:43,380 --> 02:45:44,980
I didn't realize it.

3362
02:45:45,910 --> 02:45:50,540
You can't make it seem like I'm the evil one.

3363
02:45:50,780 --> 02:45:53,480
No, we are not trying to make you the evil one.

3364
02:45:55,810 --> 02:46:00,310
At 3:00 PM, the five newbies are finally heading to that place.

3365
02:46:06,310 --> 02:46:07,080
Hey.

3366
02:46:07,080 --> 02:46:09,840
Your effort has been finally recognized,

3367
02:46:09,840 --> 02:46:12,680
so now you can work at the airport.

3368
02:46:11,680 --> 02:46:12,680
What?  All of a sudden.

3369
02:46:12,680 --> 02:46:15,480
We are going to the airport now.

3370
02:46:15,480 --> 02:46:16,980
Airport?

3371
02:46:16,980 --> 02:46:22,110
Finally Airport Duty Work!

3372
02:46:18,040 --> 02:46:19,410
Finally.

3373
02:46:21,840 --> 02:46:22,680
Let's go.

3374
02:46:23,410 --> 02:46:25,380
Everyone, please get on.

3375
02:46:32,710 --> 02:46:37,040
Leaving the training school, they finally start their duties at the airport.

3376
02:46:37,040 --> 02:46:43,410
However after this, tyrannical assassins are waiting for them!

3377
02:46:45,410 --> 02:46:47,810
Your doll looked just like you huh?

3378
02:46:47,810 --> 02:46:49,180
It really did.

3379
02:46:49,180 --> 02:46:50,040
It did.

3380
02:46:50,040 --> 02:46:51,440
That doll really looks like you!

3381
02:46:51,440 --> 02:46:57,340
Later on, it will cause new problems as you may expect.

3382
02:46:55,340 --> 02:46:55,980
Yes.

3383
02:46:56,510 --> 02:46:57,140
Yes!

3384
02:46:57,580 --> 02:46:59,380
And Jimmy-chan..

3385
02:46:59,380 --> 02:47:00,410
Jimmy-chan.

3386
02:47:00,710 --> 02:47:01,610
He's awesome.

3387
02:47:01,610 --> 02:47:03,280
Every time he gets me.

3388
02:47:03,310 --> 02:47:06,580
This year was especially awful.

3389
02:47:05,480 --> 02:47:06,380
Yes.

3390
02:47:06,740 --> 02:47:09,840
The way his tongue slipped was almost like being possessed by the supernatural.

3391
02:47:10,010 --> 02:47:10,910
HUH?

3392
02:47:10,710 --> 02:47:11,440
Picolos..

3393
02:47:13,380 --> 02:47:16,640
Please never mind me.

3394
02:47:17,040 --> 02:47:19,640
Also the baumkuchen, huh?

3395
02:47:19,880 --> 02:47:21,740
I had no doubt that I could bite it.

3396
02:47:21,740 --> 02:47:22,640
You deftly bit into it.

3397
02:47:22,640 --> 02:47:25,340
I thought that something was wrong with my teeth.

3398
02:47:26,380 --> 02:47:28,910
You thought something was wrong with your teeth.

3399
02:47:30,480 --> 02:47:34,080
Leaving the training school, they are heading to the airport.

3400
02:47:34,680 --> 02:47:37,140
Like everyone knows, it won't be an easy trip.

3401
02:47:38,380 --> 02:47:41,480
Everyone, it is a long way to the airport.

3402
02:47:41,480 --> 02:47:42,440
Are you sure?

3403
02:47:42,440 --> 02:47:43,580
Long way to go?

3404
02:47:43,580 --> 02:47:45,140
What's the distance?

3405
02:47:45,480 --> 02:47:49,910
It is a tough question.  I can't explain the distance.

3406
02:47:49,910 --> 02:47:51,480
Is it?

3407
02:47:51,480 --> 02:47:53,110
You are kind of laughing.

3408
02:47:51,910 --> 02:47:53,110
Yes he is.

3409
02:47:53,680 --> 02:47:55,110
Your face, Zaki-san.

3410
02:47:55,880 --> 02:47:58,310
Because of the sun light.

3411
02:47:58,610 --> 02:48:00,780
It is so bright that I can't help but making this face.

3412
02:48:00,780 --> 02:48:02,380
You changed expressions.

3413
02:48:02,480 --> 02:48:03,640
And you laughed.

3414
02:48:07,680 --> 02:48:09,140
It's not right!

3415
02:48:09,910 --> 02:48:13,740
I don't want to get out for something so stupid.

3416
02:48:14,640 --> 02:48:16,540
This won't be used.

3417
02:48:19,140 --> 02:48:21,240
I'm sorry for you too, but this won't be used.

3418
02:48:22,740 --> 02:48:25,380
Arrival At A Bus Stop

3419
02:48:26,780 --> 02:48:27,980
No kidding.

3420
02:48:27,440 --> 02:48:29,040
What what what?

3421
02:48:27,980 --> 02:48:29,580
Serious?

3422
02:48:29,580 --> 02:48:31,410
Is she boarding?

3423
02:48:32,580 --> 02:48:37,210
Rola Is Boarding The Bus While Laughing

3424
02:48:40,580 --> 02:48:41,940
Why is she here...

3425
02:48:41,940 --> 02:48:50,740
This was really terrible.

3426
02:48:48,710 --> 02:48:50,740
She made us laugh... with her laugh.

3427
02:48:50,940 --> 02:48:52,280
I didn't laugh.

3428
02:48:52,310 --> 02:48:54,980
Rola-chan makes me laugh.

3429
02:49:00,410 --> 02:49:02,610
Rola is laughing.

3430
02:49:02,610 --> 02:49:04,980
I can see your underwear.

3431
02:49:05,240 --> 02:49:07,240
Oh, the bus is leaving.

3432
02:49:11,780 --> 02:49:13,710
What's wrong?

3433
02:49:13,710 --> 02:49:15,580
Bye bye.

3434
02:49:19,340 --> 02:49:21,240
Moca, what's wrong?

3435
02:49:23,140 --> 02:49:24,840
Oh, I can't open it.

3436
02:49:24,840 --> 02:49:26,710
Oh, I could.

3437
02:49:26,910 --> 02:49:30,210
Rola's Favorite Pet Dog Moca

3438
02:49:30,210 --> 02:49:31,810
OK, I understand.

3439
02:49:32,410 --> 02:49:33,540
Are you hungry?

3440
02:49:34,140 --> 02:49:35,840
Do you want to eat something?

3441
02:49:37,640 --> 02:49:39,010
Do you want to hold her?

3442
02:49:43,180 --> 02:49:45,240
What is she talking about?

3443
02:49:48,680 --> 02:49:49,640
Nothing is going on

3444
02:49:49,640 --> 02:49:51,810
Nothing is going on, surely

3445
02:49:51,810 --> 02:49:53,810
What is she doing?

3446
02:49:54,610 --> 02:49:56,940
I was waiting for something to happen.

3447
02:49:57,010 --> 02:49:58,210
Right.

3448
02:49:58,910 --> 02:50:02,340
She came all of a sudden, but she is already so friendly.

3449
02:50:02,340 --> 02:50:03,940
What?

3450
02:50:03,940 --> 02:50:05,480
Are you hungry?

3451
02:50:05,910 --> 02:50:06,910
Tell me again?

3452
02:50:07,680 --> 02:50:09,580
Oh, that's right!

3453
02:50:09,740 --> 02:50:12,480
This happened about a year ago

3454
02:50:09,840 --> 02:50:16,340
Rola's Funny Story

3455
02:50:12,480 --> 02:50:14,580
When I kept Moca,

3456
02:50:16,080 --> 02:50:17,980
I still keep Moca.

3457
02:50:19,010 --> 02:50:20,480
I don't quite understand.

3458
02:50:22,980 --> 02:50:24,480
What?

3459
02:50:24,480 --> 02:50:25,710
What the hell.

3460
02:50:25,840 --> 02:50:27,040
It's not funny.

3461
02:50:28,380 --> 02:50:30,180
She still keeps it.

3462
02:50:35,240 --> 02:50:37,080
Moca, scared?  Are you scared?

3463
02:50:38,380 --> 02:51:16,840
Rola's Funny Story

3464
02:50:38,540 --> 02:50:40,280
Then, let me continue the story.

3465
02:50:40,280 --> 02:50:41,880
I have kept it.

3466
02:50:41,880 --> 02:50:44,110
Then you know what?

3467
02:50:43,040 --> 02:50:44,110
Oh, she is excited.

3468
02:50:44,110 --> 02:50:46,780
Then I was walking down on the street,

3469
02:50:46,780 --> 02:50:49,310
The place was called crossing,

3470
02:50:49,310 --> 02:50:52,340
where a lot of white lines are drawn.

3471
02:50:55,680 --> 02:50:58,510
When I was taking a walk with Moca for the first time,

3472
02:50:58,510 --> 02:51:00,840
in the middle of the street, Moca made

3473
02:51:00,840 --> 02:51:03,580
Poop.

3474
02:51:03,580 --> 02:51:05,040
I was so embarrassed

3475
02:51:05,980 --> 02:51:08,780
when people, like an old man without hair

3476
02:51:08,780 --> 02:51:10,240
was staring at me.

3477
02:51:11,180 --> 02:51:14,710
So I just, threw away the poop.

3478
02:51:15,040 --> 02:51:16,740
Finished.

3479
02:51:21,540 --> 02:51:23,780
An old man without hair..

3480
02:51:24,680 --> 02:51:26,110
What is this?

3481
02:51:26,110 --> 02:51:27,380
It's not funny at all.

3482
02:51:27,580 --> 02:51:28,740
We've had enough.

3483
02:51:29,310 --> 02:51:29,980
Bow!

3484
02:51:30,110 --> 02:51:31,780
Oh, she is mad.

3485
02:51:31,540 --> 02:51:32,240
Bow!

3486
02:51:33,510 --> 02:51:33,910
Bow!

3487
02:51:34,480 --> 02:51:42,640
Moca Is Scared Of The Black Army

3488
02:51:37,110 --> 02:51:39,280
She is so mad.

3489
02:51:39,280 --> 02:51:40,640
She is mad at them.

3490
02:51:41,740 --> 02:51:43,340
I'm sorry, Moca.

3491
02:51:42,640 --> 02:51:44,110
She got surprised.  She got surprised.

3492
02:51:44,110 --> 02:51:47,210
She didn't expect that old men dressed in female costumes would be a hit.

3493
02:51:47,210 --> 02:51:51,010
Here you go.  Go in.

3494
02:51:51,010 --> 02:51:53,440
Both sides are open.

3495
02:52:01,410 --> 02:52:02,340
Enough!

3496
02:52:03,640 --> 02:52:05,080
No more laughs!

3497
02:52:05,080 --> 02:52:06,440
What are you doing?

3498
02:52:06,610 --> 02:52:08,910
Rola-chan, please get off already.

3499
02:52:08,910 --> 02:52:10,710
OK.  Bye bye!

3500
02:52:10,980 --> 02:52:11,840
Are you getting off?

3501
02:52:12,210 --> 02:52:16,440
Yes.  Time to go.  Bye bye!

3502
02:52:14,910 --> 02:52:16,440
Time...

3503
02:52:17,210 --> 02:52:19,310
Not distance?  Time?

3504
02:52:21,880 --> 02:52:23,940
Bye bye.  Take care.

3505
02:52:24,880 --> 02:52:26,610
Oh, I'm scared!

3506
02:52:29,380 --> 02:52:30,680
It was terrible.

3507
02:52:30,340 --> 02:52:32,010
It was so terrible.

3508
02:52:32,010 --> 02:52:32,840
Yes.

3509
02:52:33,140 --> 02:52:36,280
The dog was so scared.

3510
02:52:36,810 --> 02:52:39,710
I wonder where you guys are looking the whole time.

3511
02:52:41,180 --> 02:52:43,910
I couldn't keep looking.

3512
02:52:43,910 --> 02:52:45,180
I basically kept looking.

3513
02:52:45,180 --> 02:52:46,740
All the time?

3514
02:52:46,740 --> 02:52:48,110
You shouldn't.

3515
02:52:49,210 --> 02:52:52,080
Arrival At A Bus Stop

3516
02:52:52,080 --> 02:52:53,510
I'm scared.

3517
02:52:53,440 --> 02:52:59,510
A Bad Boy Boards The Bus

3518
02:53:04,080 --> 02:53:07,310
Otaki Hideji (Sekine Tsutomu)

3519
02:53:13,910 --> 02:53:16,280
Matsumoto was laughing.

3520
02:53:19,840 --> 02:53:22,510
His face looked gold.

3521
02:53:23,180 --> 02:53:25,840
I could see the line.

3522
02:53:27,040 --> 02:53:28,480
In early evening.

3523
02:53:42,910 --> 02:53:46,110
You love women huh.

3524
02:53:47,310 --> 02:53:54,740
Especially small, pretty cute

3525
02:53:56,540 --> 02:54:00,080
girls working backstage.

3526
02:54:06,040 --> 02:54:12,480
* Endo has been dating Sekine's ex manager.

3527
02:54:11,440 --> 02:54:12,880
This is cruel.

3528
02:54:12,880 --> 02:54:14,110
It is.

3529
02:54:18,240 --> 02:54:21,240
I heard your most favorite is big boobs, correct?

3530
02:54:20,810 --> 02:54:21,280
Not.

3531
02:54:22,310 --> 02:54:23,980
No, well..

3532
02:54:27,710 --> 02:54:30,580
Big boobs are good, huh?  Boobs.

3533
02:54:38,410 --> 02:54:41,610
Hey my head is not held up yet.

3534
02:54:48,540 --> 02:54:50,010
What are you doing?

3535
02:54:59,410 --> 02:55:01,880
I was curious about the bad boy.

3536
02:55:01,880 --> 02:55:03,910
I heard you have a daughter.

3537
02:55:05,240 --> 02:55:07,310
Does she hold up her hard?

3538
02:55:07,310 --> 02:55:07,810
Yes

3539
02:55:07,810 --> 02:55:11,210
But humans can forget very easily.

3540
02:55:11,480 --> 02:55:12,680
So remember this.

3541
02:55:15,480 --> 02:55:17,380
Soon or later, she will enter the rebellious phase.

3542
02:55:18,040 --> 02:55:18,980
She will start resisting.

3543
02:55:19,880 --> 02:55:22,240
Whenever you feel angry at her,

3544
02:55:22,240 --> 02:55:26,180
please remember how cute she used to be, not holding up her head.

3545
02:55:30,210 --> 02:55:31,040
See?  Macchan.

3546
02:55:32,410 --> 02:55:33,510
Don't forget this.

3547
02:55:35,510 --> 02:55:38,380
Input this in your mind.  OK?

3548
02:55:39,980 --> 02:55:43,480
I understand.  I totally understand.

3549
02:55:51,180 --> 02:55:54,040
You've been showing a terrible attitude.

3550
02:55:54,040 --> 02:56:01,680
He Gives Instructions To The Bad boy

3551
02:55:55,640 --> 02:55:59,410
What, old man.  Got a problem?

3552
02:55:59,410 --> 02:56:01,410
You called me old man, didn't you?

3553
02:56:02,210 --> 02:56:03,410
You seem to be pretty confident but

3554
02:56:04,010 --> 02:56:06,110
have you ever lost in a fight?

3555
02:56:06,110 --> 02:56:08,640
Never once.  I am invincible.

3556
02:56:08,710 --> 02:56:11,980
OK then, I'll teach you that today.

3557
02:56:12,080 --> 02:56:12,880
Huh?

3558
02:56:12,910 --> 02:56:14,640
I'll teach you that today.

3559
02:56:25,380 --> 02:56:26,110
No room!

3560
02:56:27,910 --> 02:56:32,440
Otaki Wins By A Mile With An Arm Lock Cross Hold!

3561
02:56:34,180 --> 02:56:37,680
Otaki won in such a small space.

3562
02:56:36,080 --> 02:56:38,440
What the hell.

3563
02:56:38,640 --> 02:56:39,510
You can move.

3564
02:56:40,040 --> 02:56:41,880
That was so quick.

3565
02:56:43,180 --> 02:56:44,310
That was quick.

3566
02:56:44,310 --> 02:56:45,480
It was.

3567
02:56:45,610 --> 02:56:46,610
Yes.

3568
02:56:49,080 --> 02:56:51,880
After a fight, we should be friends.

3569
02:56:54,340 --> 02:56:57,840
So shall we have tea or something?

3570
02:57:01,580 --> 02:57:02,140
Wow

3571
02:57:02,140 --> 02:57:02,840
Wow

3572
02:57:06,140 --> 02:57:09,310
Yasoshima Hiroyuki

3573
02:57:15,110 --> 02:57:16,710
I was careless.

3574
02:57:16,080 --> 02:57:21,610
Right elbow left elbow, look at them alternately.  Right elbow left elbow, look at them alternately.

3575
02:57:21,880 --> 02:57:24,780
Right elbow left elbow, look at them alternately.

3576
02:57:25,180 --> 02:57:29,680
2700 Tsune Is Boarding

3577
02:57:26,140 --> 02:57:30,210
Right elbow left elbow, look at them alternately.

3578
02:57:30,340 --> 02:57:32,640
Right elbow left elbow, look at them alternately.

3579
02:57:32,640 --> 02:57:35,210
Right elbow left elbow, look at them alternately.

3580
02:57:37,810 --> 02:57:39,940
Look at the shoe.

3581
02:57:40,540 --> 02:57:42,610
Look at the ankle.

3582
02:57:43,280 --> 02:57:45,610
Look at the knee.

3583
02:57:46,080 --> 02:57:48,780
Look at the thigh.

3584
02:57:48,780 --> 02:57:51,240
Look at the waist.

3585
02:57:51,440 --> 02:57:53,880
Look at the side.

3586
02:57:54,180 --> 02:57:56,610
Look at the chest, look at the shoulder.

3587
02:57:56,610 --> 02:57:59,740
Hideji is coming.

3588
02:57:59,680 --> 02:58:04,580
Otaki Hideji Joins

3589
02:58:03,340 --> 02:58:04,680
What the hell.

3590
02:58:04,880 --> 02:58:09,540
* They already laughed, but please keep watching.

3591
02:58:12,110 --> 02:58:13,310
Awesome.

3592
02:58:13,310 --> 02:58:15,710
When I show the back of the card,

3593
02:58:15,710 --> 02:58:18,780
the card will disappear.  It's a magic.

3594
02:58:21,080 --> 02:58:22,840
There are no tricks.

3595
02:58:23,210 --> 02:58:25,940
There are really no tricks.

3596
02:58:26,440 --> 02:58:29,480
By any chance if anyone among you

3597
02:58:30,610 --> 02:58:33,580
is suspicious,  right elbow left elbow...

3598
02:58:34,110 --> 02:58:36,380
It got so fast.

3599
02:58:45,480 --> 02:58:46,940
I never expected.

3600
02:58:47,510 --> 02:58:49,240
2 stages.  No one expected.

3601
02:59:00,410 --> 02:59:03,210
It was just so funny.

3602
02:59:05,610 --> 02:59:10,480
They passed trials throughout the journey.  Finally the airport is just around the corner!!

3603
02:59:11,910 --> 02:59:13,840
Everyone, here we are.

3604
02:59:14,080 --> 02:59:15,780
Finally.

3605
02:59:15,780 --> 02:59:18,640
I can see the airport.

3606
02:59:19,080 --> 02:59:20,910
It's the real airport.

3607
02:59:20,440 --> 02:59:26,280
This is Ibaraki airport.  Please work well as GAS employees.

3608
02:59:27,880 --> 02:59:31,810
The stage of No-laughing is Ibaraki Airport.

3609
02:59:32,040 --> 02:59:38,980
At this genuine airport, new trials are waiting.

3610
02:59:39,680 --> 02:59:42,010
Wow, this is real.

3611
02:59:43,310 --> 02:59:45,640
Huh?  That's the real terminal!

3612
02:59:46,010 --> 02:59:47,440
Awesome.

3613
02:59:50,880 --> 02:59:56,280
Everyone, we arrived.  Please take your CA bags and get off.

3614
02:59:56,910 --> 03:00:03,880
(When Going To Work) The CA's Must Have Their Roller Bag

3615
03:00:01,610 --> 03:00:02,410
Everyone gets a bag?

3616
03:00:02,440 --> 03:00:03,880
This is mine, huh?

3617
03:00:04,880 --> 03:00:06,980
I'm fine with this.

3618
03:00:07,540 --> 03:00:08,240
OK.

3619
03:00:11,840 --> 03:00:13,440
This is how it usually goes.

3620
03:00:13,440 --> 03:00:15,540
OK.  Everyone, let's go.

3621
03:00:15,880 --> 03:00:17,040
Wow!

3622
03:00:17,040 --> 03:00:18,880
This is serious.

3623
03:00:18,140 --> 03:00:18,680
Yeah.

3624
03:00:20,880 --> 03:00:22,140
Everyone, come this way.

3625
03:00:22,540 --> 03:00:24,380
Wow!

3626
03:00:25,110 --> 03:00:26,980
Are you serious?

3627
03:00:25,910 --> 03:00:27,110
There are counters.

3628
03:00:27,340 --> 03:00:33,310
Airport Lobby

3629
03:00:29,540 --> 03:00:32,710
There are GAS counters.  Awesome, huh?

3630
03:00:34,480 --> 03:00:37,210
I can't tell what is real or fake.

3631
03:00:36,240 --> 03:00:37,810
This is great.

3632
03:00:37,810 --> 03:00:41,310
Is it really OK that we do this somewhere like this?

3633
03:00:41,510 --> 03:00:42,840
Awesome, huh?

3634
03:00:42,840 --> 03:00:44,180
Counters are there.

3635
03:00:43,540 --> 03:00:47,840
GAS Boarding Counter

3636
03:00:47,640 --> 03:00:49,910
Everyone, look.  This is an international airport.

3637
03:00:49,910 --> 03:00:51,210
It's bright, huh?

3638
03:00:52,380 --> 03:00:54,340
There is a foreign pilot.

3639
03:00:54,810 --> 03:01:03,610
Chad Mullane

3640
03:00:54,810 --> 03:01:03,610
Foreign Pilot Chats With CA

3641
03:00:56,340 --> 03:00:57,810
I've seen that little guy.

3642
03:00:57,640 --> 03:00:58,340
I know him.

3643
03:00:58,340 --> 03:01:00,080
It's Chad.

3644
03:01:00,080 --> 03:01:01,640
See, this is an international airport.

3645
03:01:01,640 --> 03:01:03,610
We can't laugh at this, huh?

3646
03:01:03,610 --> 03:01:05,580
This is so ordinary.

3647
03:01:06,210 --> 03:01:07,540
Let's go this way.

3648
03:01:11,880 --> 03:01:14,480
Wow!  Everyone, that's a Zombie!

3649
03:01:14,480 --> 03:01:21,180
Zombie Appears In The Airport Lobby

3650
03:01:19,180 --> 03:01:20,580
What the hell is it?

3651
03:01:21,910 --> 03:01:24,110
I don't think he's allowed to be here?

3652
03:01:24,110 --> 03:01:26,410
I doubt he has a passport.

3653
03:01:28,180 --> 03:01:31,310
I saw a Zombie.  It surprised me!

3654
03:01:32,140 --> 03:01:32,680
Right?

3655
03:01:33,180 --> 03:01:33,840
Yes.

3656
03:01:35,310 --> 03:01:36,740
There was a Zombie.

3657
03:01:37,180 --> 03:01:39,280
What's real in here?

3658
03:01:37,910 --> 03:01:40,140
Are we exiting already??

3659
03:01:40,840 --> 03:01:42,780
He laughed.

3660
03:01:42,240 --> 03:01:44,640
Hamada-san was laughing.

3661
03:01:43,540 --> 03:01:46,640
No I didn't.

3662
03:01:46,040 --> 03:01:48,510
You did, when Matsumoto-san spoke.

3663
03:01:48,510 --> 03:01:49,810
Yes that's true.

3664
03:01:49,040 --> 03:01:49,810
Not at all.

3665
03:01:50,610 --> 03:01:52,840
I don't recognize people.

3666
03:01:52,840 --> 03:01:54,540
I don't understand if it's real or work.

3667
03:01:55,110 --> 03:01:58,380
Wow, this is great!

3668
03:01:56,010 --> 03:01:58,140
The GAS is really standing out, Fujiwara-san!

3669
03:01:58,140 --> 03:02:03,840
Newbie Training Room

3670
03:01:58,940 --> 03:02:01,010
Wow, look.

3671
03:02:01,010 --> 03:02:02,210
This is the famous..

3672
03:02:02,210 --> 03:02:03,910
Suga Duck.

3673
03:02:02,780 --> 03:02:03,910
Suga Duck.

3674
03:02:03,210 --> 03:02:03,910
Suga Duck.

3675
03:02:05,080 --> 03:02:07,110
Well it is the symbol of GAS.

3676
03:02:07,110 --> 03:02:11,810
This time, I can really see their effort.

3677
03:02:10,880 --> 03:02:12,740
Yes, I think so.

3678
03:02:12,380 --> 03:02:14,940
This is the waiting room for newbie attendants.

3679
03:02:15,740 --> 03:02:18,380
Finally things are becoming more CA-like.

3680
03:02:18,380 --> 03:02:19,880
Really yeah.

3681
03:02:19,880 --> 03:02:21,680
Really yeah.  Now that we're at the airport.

3682
03:02:22,510 --> 03:02:23,780
But it's uplifting, huh?

3683
03:02:23,780 --> 03:02:26,280
Please take a break here for a while.

3684
03:02:25,380 --> 03:02:26,280
OK.

3685
03:02:28,640 --> 03:02:31,680
The 5 members are taking a little break in the waiting room.

3686
03:02:31,680 --> 03:02:35,110
However, one thing remains to be cleared before the start of their duties.

3687
03:02:35,680 --> 03:02:37,480
I wonder if there's anything in these drawers.

3688
03:02:37,480 --> 03:02:40,710
Cautious Of The Drawers

3689
03:02:37,640 --> 03:02:41,240
Yes, I've been wondering if it starts all over again.

3690
03:02:41,240 --> 03:02:43,080
Hey Housei-san, please check it.

3691
03:02:43,080 --> 03:02:45,410
Huh?  I don't want any more of...

3692
03:02:47,540 --> 03:02:48,210
Empty

3693
03:02:49,480 --> 03:02:51,010
Huh?

3694
03:02:51,010 --> 03:02:56,210
Something Is In The Drawer

3695
03:02:51,810 --> 03:02:52,880
What is it?

3696
03:03:00,510 --> 03:03:06,480
Matsumoto's Make-a-face Game

3697
03:03:06,710 --> 03:03:08,240
There was still something in there.

3698
03:03:08,240 --> 03:03:09,480
This is a make-a-face game.

3699
03:03:09,480 --> 03:03:10,440
That seems so.

3700
03:03:10,210 --> 03:03:12,680
Are they telling us to play with this?

3701
03:03:11,540 --> 03:03:12,680
I think so.

3702
03:03:12,680 --> 03:03:15,440
What about the other drawers?  Let me check..

3703
03:03:15,440 --> 03:03:16,080
Wanna check?

3704
03:03:21,280 --> 03:03:25,740
Matsumoto Doll

3705
03:03:28,580 --> 03:03:29,510
This is hot

3706
03:03:29,510 --> 03:03:30,880
I'm blowing it

3707
03:03:30,880 --> 03:03:32,780
SEE?

3708
03:03:33,810 --> 03:03:35,680
Don't lie.

3709
03:03:37,840 --> 03:03:39,280
Hey you!

3710
03:03:39,280 --> 03:03:41,640
This is what I set up!

3711
03:03:41,640 --> 03:03:43,380
I don't know why this is here.

3712
03:03:41,940 --> 03:03:43,380
Here they come.

3713
03:03:49,380 --> 03:03:52,880
I don't like when they pass here, because I have to move my chair every time.

3714
03:03:52,880 --> 03:03:54,440
Hey Endo, please put it away.

3715
03:03:54,440 --> 03:03:55,310
OK.

3716
03:03:55,710 --> 03:03:59,010
Continuation with Matsumoto's Drawer

3717
03:04:08,540 --> 03:04:16,580
Hamada Doll

3718
03:04:14,580 --> 03:04:16,740
This is also what I set up.

3719
03:04:18,110 --> 03:04:19,810
It can't be helped.

3720
03:04:23,480 --> 03:04:25,180
The underwear.

3721
03:04:24,680 --> 03:04:27,480
I don't get why it's wearing the female underwear.

3722
03:04:27,780 --> 03:04:29,110
Nothing there?

3723
03:04:29,780 --> 03:04:31,280
I doubt there's anything in my drawers.

3724
03:04:31,910 --> 03:04:34,380
Wow!  Again, again...

3725
03:04:34,310 --> 03:04:37,110
Again, Altered Photo of Yamazaki

3726
03:04:38,080 --> 03:04:39,640
How many times...

3727
03:04:39,640 --> 03:04:41,710
They want to make it seem like you love it.

3728
03:04:41,710 --> 03:04:43,010
I've had it.

3729
03:04:43,010 --> 03:04:44,540
I've had enough of it really.

3730
03:04:47,610 --> 03:04:49,780
Just check them all

3731
03:04:48,880 --> 03:04:49,680
OK.

3732
03:04:51,110 --> 03:04:52,440
OK, there's nothing.

3733
03:04:52,480 --> 03:04:54,740
I don't think there's anything new

3734
03:04:54,510 --> 03:04:56,040
Probably nothing in yours too.

3735
03:04:56,240 --> 03:05:03,380
Suga Kenji Doll

3736
03:05:02,510 --> 03:05:04,210
Anything new...

3737
03:05:04,210 --> 03:05:05,280
Nothing new.

3738
03:05:06,280 --> 03:05:08,180
This is the only new item.

3739
03:05:07,780 --> 03:05:09,180
Is this the only one that is new?

3740
03:05:08,180 --> 03:05:09,410
Only this make-a-face game.

3741
03:05:15,640 --> 03:05:17,410
Right elbow, left elbow

3742
03:05:17,480 --> 03:05:18,910
Look at them alternately

3743
03:05:28,340 --> 03:05:30,210
No no no.  You were laughing definitely.

3744
03:05:30,340 --> 03:05:31,380
No, I wasn't.

3745
03:05:31,410 --> 03:05:33,880
I was just looking at you, thinking that you were laughing.

3746
03:05:35,980 --> 03:05:41,340
I'm so stressed that it's such a cramped area!  I want to move everything forward.

3747
03:05:42,210 --> 03:05:45,810
You're so noisy!  Always complaining.

3748
03:05:48,510 --> 03:05:51,110
Right elbow, left elbow  Look at them alternately

3749
03:05:51,110 --> 03:05:54,380
Right elbow, left elbow  Look at them alternately

3750
03:05:55,580 --> 03:05:57,810
Matsumoto-san,  what kind of underwear is Suga doll wearing?

3751
03:05:58,510 --> 03:05:59,610
Could you check?

3752
03:05:59,880 --> 03:06:01,980
Did both of them have on the strawberry panties?

3753
03:06:01,980 --> 03:06:02,940
Yeah.

3754
03:06:04,880 --> 03:06:07,010
Wow.  Commando.

3755
03:06:05,710 --> 03:06:10,780
Suga Kenji Doll Without Underwear

3756
03:06:07,680 --> 03:06:08,580
No underwear.

3757
03:06:08,580 --> 03:06:10,480
It means he gets suntan without underwear.

3758
03:06:17,340 --> 03:06:19,240
I don't want to see it.

3759
03:06:27,380 --> 03:06:29,510
Excuse me, but I didn't laugh.

3760
03:06:34,580 --> 03:06:35,980
Shall we do this?

3761
03:06:36,640 --> 03:06:41,940
Matsumoto Tries The Make-a-face Game

3762
03:06:37,210 --> 03:06:38,810
How does it work?

3763
03:06:38,810 --> 03:06:40,410
So I will...

3764
03:06:40,410 --> 03:06:42,140
I'll pass you the parts.

3765
03:06:42,140 --> 03:06:43,810
You have to be blindfolded.

3766
03:06:42,910 --> 03:06:44,140
Please close your eyes.

3767
03:06:44,540 --> 03:06:45,680
Eyebrow.

3768
03:06:50,410 --> 03:06:51,410
Eye.

3769
03:06:53,410 --> 03:06:55,040
Can I touch the eyebrow?

3770
03:06:55,040 --> 03:06:55,810
Yes, you can.

3771
03:06:56,380 --> 03:06:57,280
Eye.

3772
03:06:58,040 --> 03:06:58,640
Mouth.

3773
03:06:58,980 --> 03:07:00,980
Is this the last piece?

3774
03:06:59,080 --> 03:07:00,640
Yes.

3775
03:07:02,310 --> 03:07:03,740
- OK.

3776
03:07:02,310 --> 03:07:03,740
It's done.

3777
03:07:04,280 --> 03:07:16,780
Matsumoto's Work

3778
03:07:14,210 --> 03:07:15,840
I tried hard not to laugh!

3779
03:07:22,680 --> 03:07:24,810
The eyes are up-side-down.

3780
03:07:26,080 --> 03:07:27,440
Can you do it next, Hamada-san?

3781
03:07:27,280 --> 03:07:31,580
Hamada Tries The Make-a-face Game

3782
03:07:28,310 --> 03:07:30,080
We still have..

3783
03:07:30,080 --> 03:07:32,410
some time to kill.

3784
03:07:34,110 --> 03:07:35,510
Mouth.

3785
03:07:38,610 --> 03:07:40,310
I have no clue.

3786
03:07:45,910 --> 03:07:48,480
Try checking it once, since the mouth is so off.

3787
03:07:48,480 --> 03:07:55,610
Hamada's Work

3788
03:07:53,310 --> 03:07:55,210
Hey you.

3789
03:07:55,610 --> 03:07:58,440
The mouth is so off.

3790
03:07:58,040 --> 03:07:59,080
You can do that?

3791
03:08:01,010 --> 03:08:01,980
Tanaka, Try it.

3792
03:08:01,980 --> 03:08:02,780
OK.

3793
03:08:03,180 --> 03:08:04,910
You have to do it at least once.

3794
03:08:03,610 --> 03:08:07,780
Tanaka Tries The Make-a-Face Game

3795
03:08:04,910 --> 03:08:06,210
Yes, at least once.

3796
03:08:07,010 --> 03:08:10,010
It can be really good sometimes.

3797
03:08:09,810 --> 03:08:13,010
I want you to make it perfect.  So we can say...

3798
03:08:13,840 --> 03:08:15,510
Wow, that's awesome!

3799
03:08:15,510 --> 03:08:16,910
Just like a regular picture!

3800
03:08:16,740 --> 03:08:19,580
Blank Side

3801
03:08:17,180 --> 03:08:18,280
Not yet, not yet.

3802
03:08:18,280 --> 03:08:19,610
Not yet.

3803
03:08:19,610 --> 03:08:20,410
Which part?

3804
03:08:20,740 --> 03:08:23,580
The nose.  I'll start from the center.

3805
03:08:22,810 --> 03:08:27,010
If you can get the nose in the right postion,

3806
03:08:25,210 --> 03:08:29,810
it can turn out to be a real picture Matsumoto-san.

3807
03:08:27,640 --> 03:08:28,540
I see.

3808
03:08:30,710 --> 03:08:31,910
Center.

3809
03:08:31,980 --> 03:08:32,840
What's this?

3810
03:08:32,910 --> 03:08:34,540
It's the eye.

3811
03:08:34,880 --> 03:08:38,210
Facial spacing is really important.

3812
03:08:38,040 --> 03:08:39,940
Looking good

3813
03:08:40,280 --> 03:08:42,380
He's a natural

3814
03:08:42,410 --> 03:08:44,180
Is it done?

3815
03:08:42,410 --> 03:08:44,180
Yes, open your eyes.

3816
03:08:44,210 --> 03:08:52,310
Tanaka's Work

3817
03:08:49,980 --> 03:08:51,080
Oh, sorry.

3818
03:08:51,080 --> 03:08:52,340
It's the wrong side.

3819
03:08:52,640 --> 03:08:54,010
I thought something was wrong.

3820
03:08:53,540 --> 03:08:54,740
This is up-side-down.

3821
03:08:54,940 --> 03:08:57,040
So it doesn't stick.

3822
03:08:57,910 --> 03:09:00,010
What a face..

3823
03:09:00,180 --> 03:09:01,640
But this is fun

3824
03:09:02,840 --> 03:09:04,410
PM 5:00,

3825
03:09:04,410 --> 03:09:08,110
Duties at the airport are broad, and sometimes problems like this can occur.

3826
03:09:09,080 --> 03:09:10,180
Everyone, there's a trouble!

3827
03:09:10,180 --> 03:09:11,080
Huh?

3828
03:09:11,080 --> 03:09:13,940
The labor union that constructs landing fields at the airport

3829
03:09:13,940 --> 03:09:15,540
is striking

3830
03:09:15,540 --> 03:09:18,080
because of their low wages.

3831
03:09:16,610 --> 03:09:18,080
It has nothing to do with us.

3832
03:09:19,080 --> 03:09:20,710
Starting now at the neighborhood public hall,

3833
03:09:20,710 --> 03:09:24,380
the Labor union and our General Affairs Division are going to have a discussion.

3834
03:09:24,380 --> 03:09:26,980
Everyone can you please attend this meeting?

3835
03:09:27,680 --> 03:09:30,380
Is it necessary for us?

3836
03:09:28,310 --> 03:09:36,340
Discussion With Airport Employees

3837
03:09:28,310 --> 03:09:36,340
Laborers Strike

3838
03:09:30,380 --> 03:09:32,610
It's a pain in the ass.

3839
03:09:33,480 --> 03:09:35,480
Such a pain.

3840
03:09:35,480 --> 03:09:36,940
Public hall?

3841
03:09:36,810 --> 03:09:39,280
Wow a bus is waiting for us.

3842
03:09:39,710 --> 03:09:40,580
It's dark.

3843
03:09:41,610 --> 03:09:42,940
Cold.

3844
03:09:43,680 --> 03:09:45,980
Please take your seats.

3845
03:09:45,980 --> 03:09:48,010
We're riding a bus again.

3846
03:09:47,810 --> 03:09:48,810
Cold.

3847
03:09:51,140 --> 03:09:57,040
The bus is taking the five members to the neighborhood public hall.

3848
03:09:59,080 --> 03:10:01,310
Airport employees and labors.

3849
03:10:01,310 --> 03:10:03,280
Wonder who they are..

3850
03:10:04,580 --> 03:10:06,540
What is he doing?

3851
03:10:07,340 --> 03:10:09,740
He sometimes acts

3852
03:10:09,740 --> 03:10:12,010
as if he was a hooker.

3853
03:10:12,010 --> 03:10:12,910
Here we are.

3854
03:10:16,040 --> 03:10:17,310
Excuse me.

3855
03:10:18,980 --> 03:10:19,910
Here we go

3856
03:10:19,940 --> 03:10:26,140
Discussion Swiftly Reaches It's Climax

3857
03:10:25,580 --> 03:10:28,510
This was really really tough.

3858
03:10:26,010 --> 03:10:26,980
Hey!

3859
03:10:26,980 --> 03:10:30,440
Stop complaining.  Just sit down there!

3860
03:10:30,840 --> 03:10:32,980
We are not complaining...

3861
03:10:32,980 --> 03:10:34,310
We didn't speak at all.

3862
03:10:34,310 --> 03:10:36,840
What are you going to do about this!

3863
03:10:35,140 --> 03:10:37,610
We have been working hard!

3864
03:10:37,610 --> 03:10:39,440
But it was funny.
- Yes.

3865
03:10:38,840 --> 03:10:41,540
OK then, I'll come get you guys later.

3866
03:10:42,010 --> 03:10:46,810
We can't raise your pay,  considering  the quality of your work!

3867
03:10:48,610 --> 03:10:51,110
If you're unwilling to do it,

3868
03:10:51,110 --> 03:10:53,610
let's fight against each other!

3869
03:10:56,840 --> 03:11:00,140
OK, let's do it then!

3870
03:11:01,080 --> 03:11:06,780
Battle With Their Bodies

3871
03:11:01,080 --> 03:11:06,780
Negotiations Failed

3872
03:11:04,540 --> 03:11:06,880
They make decisions by doing this?

3873
03:11:07,140 --> 03:11:09,810
I think if would be better if you just discussed it verbally.

3874
03:11:09,810 --> 03:11:18,040
Airport Employees Are Ready To Fight

3875
03:11:12,110 --> 03:11:13,740
I'm ready to fight!

3876
03:11:18,040 --> 03:11:20,880

Bring it on!

3879
03:11:24,910 --> 03:11:26,180
Here it comes!

3880
03:11:27,040 --> 03:11:28,740
Hey!  Do you guys know what this is?

3881
03:11:29,010 --> 03:11:30,140
What is it?

3882
03:11:29,880 --> 03:11:31,680
This is Plastic Bottle Launcher!

3883
03:11:31,840 --> 03:11:33,210
Wow, it looks awesome!

3884
03:11:35,910 --> 03:11:41,480
A regular person would normally take a hit on the butt.

3885
03:11:41,480 --> 03:11:46,310
But our Kuro-chan, he cant take it on his chin!

3886
03:11:53,580 --> 03:11:56,580
(Yasuda Dai Circus)

3887
03:11:53,580 --> 03:11:56,580
Kuro-chan

3888
03:11:53,580 --> 03:11:56,580
Laborer

3889
03:11:56,040 --> 03:11:57,280
I'm ready!

3890
03:11:58,340 --> 03:12:00,640
I'll put as much air as it can take, OK?

3891
03:12:00,080 --> 03:12:01,610
I'm ready, fill it up!

3892
03:12:01,810 --> 03:12:07,840
Receive a punch to the chin from a bottle rocket powered glove

3893
03:12:07,010 --> 03:12:08,180
It can take more!

3894
03:12:08,840 --> 03:12:11,140
It's making a strange noise...

3895
03:12:12,480 --> 03:12:13,680
Now it's fully powered!

3896
03:12:13,880 --> 03:12:14,980
OK!

3897
03:12:14,980 --> 03:12:16,140
Are you ready, Kuro-chan?

3898
03:12:15,580 --> 03:12:16,140
Yes!

3899
03:12:20,640 --> 03:12:21,980
Go!

3900
03:12:24,340 --> 03:12:30,410
A Glancing Blow

3901
03:12:35,540 --> 03:12:37,640
You guys are not fighting at all!

3902
03:12:35,810 --> 03:12:37,110
Not at all.

3903
03:12:37,640 --> 03:12:40,410
You just got wet a little bit.

3904
03:12:40,540 --> 03:12:42,210
A perfect hit!

3905
03:12:44,180 --> 03:12:45,280
OK, that was good.

3906
03:12:49,480 --> 03:12:51,810
Let's move on to the next fight!

3907
03:12:52,240 --> 03:12:53,740
Bring it out!

3908
03:12:57,210 --> 03:12:59,140
What is this?

3909
03:12:57,940 --> 03:12:59,180
It looks like a washing machine.

3910
03:12:59,180 --> 03:13:01,080
This is obviously a washing machine.

3911
03:13:01,740 --> 03:13:03,840
Here we have some Ramen.

3912
03:13:03,080 --> 03:13:06,610
* Ramen = a bowl of hot Chinese noodle soup.

3913
03:13:04,580 --> 03:13:08,680
Can anyone eat this in the washing machine?

3914
03:13:11,380 --> 03:13:13,780
This is impossible.

3915
03:13:13,780 --> 03:13:16,910
(Football Hour)

3916
03:13:13,780 --> 03:13:16,910

3917
03:13:13,780 --> 03:13:16,910
Iwao Nozomu

3918
03:13:17,640 --> 03:13:21,880
I doubt someone who is only a desk jockey can do this!

3919
03:13:20,010 --> 03:13:21,980
He can't!

3920
03:13:21,980 --> 03:13:23,280
Go for it!

3921
03:13:23,280 --> 03:13:24,280
Let's see it!

3922
03:13:28,110 --> 03:13:29,680
Hurry up and get in there

3923
03:13:33,740 --> 03:13:37,480
Didn't you rehearse this?  If so, you should be able to get in there at least!

3924
03:13:39,340 --> 03:13:41,010
Yes, that's it.

3925
03:13:41,210 --> 03:13:47,980
Eat a bowl of hot Ramen in the special washing machine

3926
03:13:43,410 --> 03:13:44,810
Is this serious?

3927
03:13:44,810 --> 03:13:46,580
This is crazy.

3928
03:13:46,580 --> 03:13:47,280
Yeah.

3929
03:13:49,280 --> 03:13:52,180
It's hot

3930
03:13:50,910 --> 03:13:52,180
Be careful

3931
03:13:52,180 --> 03:13:53,910
It's even better for me if it's hot.

3932
03:13:54,710 --> 03:13:55,840
He serious?

3933
03:13:55,210 --> 03:13:55,880
Is he?

3934
03:13:56,580 --> 03:13:57,480
Just like that?

3935
03:13:59,210 --> 03:14:00,140
START!

3936
03:14:09,280 --> 03:14:11,010
That's enough!

3937
03:14:16,380 --> 03:14:20,540
His right nipple was centered as he rolled around!

3938
03:14:26,810 --> 03:14:31,440
So you Officers can only handle Ramen after all.

3939
03:14:30,810 --> 03:14:31,540
What are you saying?

3940
03:14:31,440 --> 03:14:35,740
On the other hand, our Tanaka can handle Miso Nikomi Udon!

3941
03:14:33,010 --> 03:14:36,540
* Miso Nikomi Udon = A hot pot with thick miso flavored soup and noodle

3942
03:14:36,280 --> 03:14:37,640
Show them!

3943
03:14:37,210 --> 03:14:39,610
Hurry up

3944
03:14:39,610 --> 03:14:42,440
Hurry up and get out!

3945
03:14:48,280 --> 03:14:50,240
This doesn't matter at all.

3946
03:14:53,410 --> 03:14:54,480
Hurry up.

3947
03:14:54,640 --> 03:14:55,810
What are you doing?

3948
03:14:55,810 --> 03:14:57,780
Like he's being born.

3949
03:15:03,910 --> 03:15:07,040

3950
03:15:03,910 --> 03:15:07,040

Tanaka Takushi

3952
03:15:05,340 --> 03:15:07,410
This is super hot Miso Nikomi Udon.

3953
03:15:07,410 --> 03:15:08,610
It must be hard with his height.

3954
03:15:08,610 --> 03:15:09,910
He has to fold his body.

3955
03:15:10,180 --> 03:15:16,740
Eat a "super hot" Miso Nikomi Udon in the special washing machine

3956
03:15:14,210 --> 03:15:15,980
That looks hot.

3957
03:15:17,080 --> 03:15:17,710
It's so hot.

3958
03:15:17,710 --> 03:15:18,580
Hold the edge.

3959
03:15:18,580 --> 03:15:19,710
It's steaming hot

3960
03:15:19,840 --> 03:15:21,510
Leave it to me!

3961
03:15:22,080 --> 03:15:24,410
Rolling

3962
03:15:23,410 --> 03:15:24,410
Start!

3963
03:15:43,740 --> 03:15:45,580
This looks so tough!

3964
03:15:46,440 --> 03:15:48,280
Very scary.

3965
03:15:55,180 --> 03:15:57,310
He's still eating it.  He's still eating it.

3966
03:15:57,410 --> 03:15:58,940
He's tough.

3967
03:15:59,040 --> 03:16:00,840
HE'S BORN!

3968
03:16:01,480 --> 03:16:04,480
You can't even call that hot!

3969
03:16:04,480 --> 03:16:06,780
Bring "it" here!

3970
03:16:09,440 --> 03:16:11,380
Stop it!

3971
03:16:11,380 --> 03:16:13,310
Take a look at this, this is super hot Sara Udon!

3972
03:16:11,880 --> 03:16:15,940
* Sara Udon = a plate of hot thick noodle porridge

3973
03:16:15,540 --> 03:16:19,540
Sara Udon... Isn't it the specialty of Nagasaki?

3974
03:16:18,640 --> 03:16:19,540
That doesn't matter now!

3975
03:16:18,810 --> 03:16:19,840
It doesn't matter now, does it?

3976
03:16:19,810 --> 03:16:23,880
Our Haranishi will eat this with hands.

3977
03:16:23,880 --> 03:16:27,310

03:16:23,880 --> 03:16:27,310

Using his bare hands, finish a plate of super hot Sara Udon within 1 minute

3980
03:16:31,440 --> 03:16:32,880
It looks so good!

3981
03:16:32,880 --> 03:16:34,640
OK!  Go for it!

3982
03:16:35,540 --> 03:16:36,410
Start!

3983
03:16:53,440 --> 03:16:54,740
You didn't eat anything!

3984
03:16:58,040 --> 03:17:01,780
* The have already laughed, but please keep watching

Quail egg

3986
03:17:05,380 --> 03:17:07,540
Quail egg

3987
03:17:06,980 --> 03:17:09,040
It must have been hot!

3988
03:17:13,610 --> 03:17:15,180
He can't do it at all.

3989
03:17:19,180 --> 03:17:20,610
It's hot.

3990
03:17:21,610 --> 03:17:23,310
He still has time.

3991
03:17:24,680 --> 03:17:27,310
Why did you throw it away?

3992
03:17:25,840 --> 03:17:27,310
I'm tired

3993
03:17:26,410 --> 03:17:27,310
I'M TIRED

3994
03:17:26,810 --> 03:17:27,310
I CAN'T BREATHE

3995
03:17:27,480 --> 03:17:28,610
Go for it!

3996
03:17:30,480 --> 03:17:32,940
Why did you throw it down!

3997
03:17:38,340 --> 03:17:40,080
This is no good, Haranishi.

3998
03:17:42,240 --> 03:17:45,480
This can't be done!

3999
03:17:48,140 --> 03:17:49,410
It seems like

4000
03:17:49,410 --> 03:17:50,880
you guys are scared.

4001
03:17:50,880 --> 03:17:52,480
Yoshinobu is even better.  Right?

4002
03:17:52,340 --> 03:17:54,780
Laborer

4003

Do it!

4006
03:18:00,240 --> 03:18:07,680
Move all the snakes into the black box within 1 minute

4007
03:18:04,480 --> 03:18:06,280
Let's see it.

4008
03:18:06,280 --> 03:18:07,110
OK!

4009
03:18:07,110 --> 03:18:08,110
Good luck.

4010
03:18:08,110 --> 03:18:08,580
Ready?

4011
03:18:09,580 --> 03:18:10,640
Start!

4012
03:18:19,910 --> 03:18:21,210
They are pretty aggressive huh.

4013
03:18:22,280 --> 03:18:23,540
They are kind of big.

4014
03:18:23,540 --> 03:18:24,380
Yes, they are.

4015
03:18:24,380 --> 03:18:26,210
They are big and thick.

4016
03:18:32,280 --> 03:18:35,280
You got scared!

4017
03:18:39,540 --> 03:18:41,540
He screamed

4018
03:18:43,580 --> 03:18:46,310
There's still time left.

4019
03:18:50,240 --> 03:18:52,140
Put it in the box.

4020
03:18:57,280 --> 03:18:59,380
Pull it with your left hand!

4021
03:18:59,380 --> 03:19:00,480
Just pull it.

4022
03:19:00,480 --> 03:19:01,680
Yes, that's how!

4023
03:19:02,680 --> 03:19:03,640
What the hell are you doing?

4024
03:19:06,140 --> 03:19:07,180
What is this?

4025
03:19:12,040 --> 03:19:13,640
Looks like an old folk story

4026
03:19:14,640 --> 03:19:16,140
I don't understand what he is trying to do.

4027
03:19:17,710 --> 03:19:19,380
What the hell!

4028
03:19:24,410 --> 03:19:26,680
Good job, Yoshinobu!

4029
03:19:29,580 --> 03:19:31,710
Bring it here!

4030
03:19:32,910 --> 03:19:34,610
Here it comes

4031
03:19:34,610 --> 03:19:37,640
This is very hot.

4032
03:19:36,910 --> 03:19:37,910
Watch out!

4033
03:19:37,910 --> 03:19:45,210
Our General Manager, doesn't get scared.  Even if this burns his butt!

4034
03:19:38,140 --> 03:19:45,240
Place the special material on his butt and light the fuse. When the lit fuse reaches the material, it instantly burns and disappears.

4035
03:19:43,340 --> 03:19:45,410
Yeah!

4036
03:19:45,240 --> 03:19:48,080
Degawa Tetsurou

4037
03:19:45,240 --> 03:19:48,080
General Affairs GM

4038
03:19:47,840 --> 03:19:49,180
Light it up!

4039
03:19:49,180 --> 03:19:51,080
Please do so!

4040
03:19:52,310 --> 03:19:53,310
OK!

4041
03:19:53,310 --> 03:19:54,710
OK GM, are you ready?

4042
03:19:54,540 --> 03:19:57,080
Please light it!

4043
03:19:57,080 --> 03:19:59,010
The fuse is so long

4044
03:20:02,740 --> 03:20:03,610
It's coming.

4045
03:20:04,110 --> 03:20:04,980
Bring it!

4046
03:20:04,980 --> 03:20:06,710
The fuse is long, huh.

4047
03:20:08,740 --> 03:20:09,640
Here it comes!

4048
03:20:09,640 --> 03:20:11,180
Hot!  Hot!

4049
03:20:15,180 --> 03:20:18,140
Hot!

4050
03:20:16,710 --> 03:20:18,140
COLD!

4051
03:20:18,140 --> 03:20:23,310
Degawa GM Pretends To Be Strong And Says "Cold"

4052
03:20:19,010 --> 03:20:20,480
It's cold!

4053
03:20:21,880 --> 03:20:23,840
It's cold!

4054
03:20:28,880 --> 03:20:30,710
It wouldn't be cold.

4055
03:20:31,080 --> 03:20:33,740
We can't stay quiet seeing this.

4056
03:20:33,740 --> 03:20:34,110
Yeah!

4057
03:20:34,240 --> 03:20:37,110
Bring me the double sized cotton.

4058
03:20:37,110 --> 03:20:38,380
I'll handle this.

4059
03:20:40,640 --> 03:20:44,880
He Tries Double The Amount

4060
03:20:43,580 --> 03:20:44,640
OK, I'm ready!

4061
03:20:45,880 --> 03:20:46,480
Fire!

4062
03:20:46,240 --> 03:20:47,580
This is a lot

4063
03:20:48,140 --> 03:20:49,010
Here it goes.

4064
03:20:51,880 --> 03:20:54,310
Aren't you scared?

4065
03:20:57,110 --> 03:20:58,680
Come on!  Come on!

4066
03:21:01,080 --> 03:21:01,910
It's coming.

4067
03:21:03,840 --> 03:21:05,440
Come on!  Come on!

4068
03:21:10,640 --> 03:21:12,010
Here it comes!

4069
03:21:12,010 --> 03:21:13,180
Come on!  Come on!

4070
03:21:17,780 --> 03:21:20,140
Fuse debris

4071
03:21:26,180 --> 03:21:27,280
OK.

4072
03:21:27,280 --> 03:21:29,310
Awesome!

4073
03:21:31,640 --> 03:21:35,280
That was tough huh.

4074
03:21:36,110 --> 03:21:37,880
Crazy.

4075
03:21:37,110 --> 03:21:37,940
That's how you do it.

4076
03:21:37,940 --> 03:21:40,810
Bring it out here!

4077
03:21:42,040 --> 03:21:44,010
The next thing brought out is

4078
03:21:43,810 --> 03:21:49,480
Konpeitou Candies On Tatami Mats

4079
03:21:44,010 --> 03:21:46,510
* Konpeitou = tiny & hard sugar candies

4080
03:21:44,010 --> 03:21:46,510
Konpeito is spread out on tatami mats.

4081
03:21:47,240 --> 03:21:48,510
It has got to hurt.

4082
03:21:48,510 --> 03:21:49,910
A Judo expert,

4083
03:21:49,910 --> 03:21:52,910
will flip him on to the mat.

4084
03:21:49,980 --> 03:21:55,910
A Judo expert will flip him on to the mat.

4085
03:21:52,910 --> 03:21:55,940
It will be painful.

4086
03:21:56,180 --> 03:21:58,180
This will be painful

4087
03:21:58,180 --> 03:22:04,610
Our Wakki with be thrown naked like this!

4088
03:22:10,680 --> 03:22:16,780
(Penalty)

4089
03:22:10,680 --> 03:22:16,780
General Affairs Division

4090
03:22:10,680 --> 03:22:16,780
Wakki

4091
03:22:12,710 --> 03:22:13,640
Are you OK?

4092
03:22:13,640 --> 03:22:14,410
Yes.

4093
03:22:14,940 --> 03:22:17,140
As I thought he's holding his neck.

4094
03:22:18,040 --> 03:22:19,510
OK, I'm ready!

4095
03:22:19,140 --> 03:22:20,310
OK, let's start.

4096
03:22:26,680 --> 03:22:32,080
Landed Hard On The Back And Butt

4097
03:22:34,310 --> 03:22:35,810
This is tough.

4098
03:22:42,940 --> 03:22:44,580
Show it to them!

4099
03:22:45,540 --> 03:22:46,840
This is...

4100
03:22:47,580 --> 03:22:51,040
heated liquid wax to pour on your head.

4101
03:22:48,840 --> 03:22:55,310
Pour heated liquid wax on head

4102
03:22:55,510 --> 03:22:56,510
Can you do it!?

4103
03:22:59,140 --> 03:23:00,480
OK, I can do it!

4104
03:23:00,480 --> 03:23:02,380
OK, go!

4105
03:23:08,210 --> 03:23:12,580
Not Enough Wax Was Used

4106
03:23:19,010 --> 03:23:21,340
It's getting hot.

4107
03:23:23,610 --> 03:23:26,840
Do you eventually feel the heat?

4108
03:23:24,780 --> 03:23:26,010
What the hell.

4109
03:23:30,580 --> 03:23:33,380
Iwao, show them how it's done!

4110
03:23:33,880 --> 03:23:37,510
Iwao can handle 2 buckets.  2 Buckets!

4111
03:23:39,340 --> 03:23:39,880
Huh?

4112
03:23:39,680 --> 03:23:41,010
There are a lot.

4113
03:23:41,010 --> 03:23:43,740
There are 3 buckets.  Hey!

4114
03:23:44,340 --> 03:23:46,080
3 buckets!

4115
03:23:46,080 --> 03:23:47,610
OK, go for it!

4116
03:23:47,680 --> 03:23:49,340
Here I go!

4117
03:23:53,840 --> 03:23:54,710
Hot!

4118
03:24:01,910 --> 03:24:03,280
Monster...

4119
03:24:03,280 --> 03:24:05,440
He is a monster.

4120
03:24:07,740 --> 03:24:10,010
This is a monster.

4121
03:24:17,210 --> 03:24:20,140
It's a monster!

4122
03:24:21,780 --> 03:24:23,240
Monster.  A monster!

4123
03:24:23,610 --> 03:24:25,110
What's with you!

4124
03:24:25,110 --> 03:24:26,680
Sit down.

4125
03:24:27,410 --> 03:24:29,140
Iwao!

4126
03:24:29,140 --> 03:24:32,910
Iwao!  Iwao!  Iwao!

4127
03:24:51,240 --> 03:24:53,240
Can this be aired?

4128
03:24:54,680 --> 03:24:56,410
Good.

4129
03:24:56,410 --> 03:24:58,080
Good job!

4130
03:24:59,180 --> 03:25:00,840
It's all over the floor.

4131
03:25:00,840 --> 03:25:04,640
This is a final round.

4132
03:25:02,180 --> 03:25:04,010
Yeah!

4133
03:25:05,240 --> 03:25:08,840
It will be, arm wrestling!

4134
03:25:10,440 --> 03:25:13,010
But regular arm wresting is boring so...

4135
03:25:13,340 --> 03:25:20,510
before we start, we'll insert air into each player's butt.

4136
03:25:21,640 --> 03:25:24,910
Then whoever makes a fart first will lose. How that?

4137
03:25:33,410 --> 03:25:34,410
What did he just say?

4138
03:25:34,410 --> 03:25:35,580
What is it?  Seriously.

4139
03:25:38,610 --> 03:25:41,740
What kind of rule is that.

4140
03:25:41,740 --> 03:25:43,840
Watch out.  Don't say it in a funny way.

4141
03:25:44,810 --> 03:25:45,940
OK!

4142
03:25:46,540 --> 03:25:48,210
Whoever makes a fart first will lose!

4143
03:25:47,840 --> 03:25:49,910
Fart doesn't matter.

4144
03:25:48,740 --> 03:25:49,910
I should just have to win in arm wrestling, right?

4145
03:25:49,910 --> 03:25:53,010
Ueshima-san.  Can I get your help?

4146
03:25:51,010 --> 03:25:51,840
OK!

4147
03:25:53,010 --> 03:25:55,840
(Dacho Club)

4148
03:25:53,010 --> 03:25:55,840
Boss

4149
03:25:53,010 --> 03:25:55,840
Ueshima Ryuhei

4150
03:25:56,440 --> 03:25:58,110
I said I'm going.

4151
03:25:57,940 --> 03:26:01,140
To begin with, can you take air in your butt?

4152
03:26:01,140 --> 03:26:02,940
Of course I can!  Moron.

4153
03:26:02,940 --> 03:26:04,440
You said that.

4154
03:26:04,440 --> 03:26:05,140
I'll do it.

4155
03:26:05,140 --> 03:26:05,780
I will.

4156
03:26:05,780 --> 03:26:07,440
Can you do that?

4157
03:26:07,840 --> 03:26:09,440
GM, can I get your help?

4158
03:26:09,410 --> 03:26:11,980
OK, I will!

4159
03:26:19,840 --> 03:26:21,310
OK, let me go!

4160
03:26:26,480 --> 03:26:28,510
Hard to believe that he can
just standby like that.

4161
03:26:31,640 --> 03:26:33,540
He is very boyish.

4162
03:26:33,540 --> 03:26:35,040
No way.

4163
03:26:35,280 --> 03:26:36,510
Am I OK?

4164
03:26:39,410 --> 03:26:41,910
Can you take Nozomu-chan backstage?

4165
03:26:41,910 --> 03:26:44,740
We are friends

4166
03:26:43,480 --> 03:26:44,880
I will be watching.

4167
03:26:46,110 --> 03:26:47,340
You will be right?

4168
03:26:47,340 --> 03:26:50,080
Yes, I will be.

4169
03:26:47,540 --> 03:26:47,980
Will you so?

4170
03:26:51,910 --> 03:26:54,240
Can you stick out your butt little more?

4171
03:26:56,610 --> 03:26:57,310
Does it hurt?

4172
03:26:57,310 --> 03:26:57,980
No, it doesn't.

4173
03:26:57,980 --> 03:26:59,810
Are you OK?  Does it hurt?

4174
03:27:02,680 --> 03:27:04,110
What are you doing?

4175
03:27:05,440 --> 03:27:06,940
What are you guys doing?

4176
03:27:06,940 --> 03:27:08,940
Come on!

4177
03:27:10,740 --> 03:27:14,110
I don't want to watch this preparation...

4178
03:27:14,110 --> 03:27:16,940
Try to find a better position.

4179
03:27:17,180 --> 03:27:19,910
Does it hurt?  Are you OK?

4180
03:27:17,910 --> 03:27:18,510
No it doesn't.

4181
03:27:35,810 --> 03:27:37,240
What are you doing?

4182
03:27:42,210 --> 03:27:45,740
Not yet!  I haven't done it!

4183
03:27:48,640 --> 03:27:49,610
OK.  Try now.

4184
03:27:49,940 --> 03:27:50,410
Does it hurt?

4185
03:27:50,410 --> 03:27:51,010
No.

4186
03:27:51,940 --> 03:27:56,440
Hosshan Completes The Air Insertion

4187
03:27:52,340 --> 03:27:53,040
OK.

4188
03:27:53,040 --> 03:27:54,110
OK!

4189
03:27:54,110 --> 03:27:56,440
OK, wait.  Can you do mine, Ueshima-san?

4190
03:27:56,440 --> 03:27:58,710
Wait.. Mine is kind of dirty..

4191
03:27:58,610 --> 03:28:00,110
Hurry up!

4192
03:28:18,780 --> 03:28:21,980
It doesn't matter as he hasn't stood on the stage!

4193
03:28:20,510 --> 03:28:21,610
That's right!

4194
03:28:23,740 --> 03:28:27,480
Useshima hurry up!

4195
03:28:24,180 --> 03:28:26,180
Ueshima, hurry up and do it!

4196
03:28:28,510 --> 03:28:30,340
You do it first then

4197
03:28:30,080 --> 03:28:32,280
Can you do it again?

4198
03:28:32,280 --> 03:28:33,510
OK.  Like this?

4199
03:28:33,510 --> 03:28:38,880
Ueshima-san.

4200
03:28:36,040 --> 03:28:38,880
You've got so many warts.

4201
03:28:38,880 --> 03:28:42,140
That doesn't matter right now!

4202
03:28:46,910 --> 03:28:48,340
Damn!

4203
03:28:49,480 --> 03:28:51,440
We don't need to know that!

4204
03:28:54,310 --> 03:28:56,180
Hey, I will go!

4205
03:28:59,540 --> 03:29:04,540
Boss Ueshima's Butt Is Sensitive

4206
03:29:10,610 --> 03:29:11,910
We've had enough of this!

4207
03:29:11,910 --> 03:29:14,180
Be more patient!

4208
03:29:19,080 --> 03:29:23,840
They should be adding air at the same time, huh?

4209
03:29:21,480 --> 03:29:23,710
Yes, do it together.

4210
03:29:24,510 --> 03:29:27,510
That's enough

4211
03:29:25,640 --> 03:29:26,080
Are you OK?

4212
03:29:26,080 --> 03:29:27,510
It's full

4213
03:29:26,780 --> 03:29:27,640
Full?

4214
03:29:27,640 --> 03:29:29,010
OK, let's start!

4215
03:29:29,540 --> 03:29:30,680
OK, please add it now.

4216
03:29:41,810 --> 03:29:43,580
Hurry up!

4217
03:29:45,310 --> 03:29:47,210
What the hell!

4218
03:29:51,740 --> 03:29:55,680
I'm impressed.  You guys can really do well.

4219
03:29:56,340 --> 03:30:00,880
Isn't it fine to just finish the job you have right now?

4220
03:29:56,440 --> 03:29:57,310
Each other.

4221
03:30:01,810 --> 03:30:06,780
They Came To An Understanding

4222
03:30:04,040 --> 03:30:05,380
Do your best!

4223
03:30:05,380 --> 03:30:06,710
Now please go on.

4224
03:30:07,010 --> 03:30:09,510
Ryu-chan did it come out?

4225
03:30:09,040 --> 03:30:10,080
Huh?

4226
03:30:10,080 --> 03:30:12,480
Yeah, it feels like it's going to come out.

4227
03:30:14,680 --> 03:30:18,240
Ah, should I add some air?

4228
03:30:15,440 --> 03:30:18,180
He is amazing, it comes out soon.

4229
03:30:20,510 --> 03:30:22,610
Huh?  What is this?

4230
03:30:21,480 --> 03:30:22,610
Air going in.

4231
03:30:22,780 --> 03:30:24,780
Fart

4232
03:30:31,010 --> 03:30:31,980
Try harder!

4233
03:30:31,980 --> 03:30:34,410
It came out already!?

4234
03:30:35,340 --> 03:30:38,180
You better try harder!

4235
03:30:41,810 --> 03:30:44,280
Why did he let it out!

4236
03:30:44,980 --> 03:30:46,080
7 pm

4237
03:30:46,110 --> 03:30:49,610
They have returned to the airport, from now they will start their work in earnest.

4238
03:30:50,010 --> 03:30:51,610
Everyone it's over here.

4239
03:30:52,010 --> 03:30:53,910
Their first assignment is

4240
03:30:53,910 --> 03:30:58,080
to welcome Passengers at the check-in counter as the image of the airport.

4241
03:30:59,080 --> 03:31:00,340
Shall we line up here?

4242
03:30:59,210 --> 03:31:03,540
Boarding Counter

4243
03:31:00,340 --> 03:31:01,480
Wow this is cool.

4244
03:31:00,980 --> 03:31:03,180
Hamada, Matsumoto, Yamazaki...

4245
03:31:07,040 --> 03:31:08,010
It's starting

4246
03:31:07,680 --> 03:31:08,410
Yes.

4247
03:31:08,810 --> 03:31:12,940
Many Passengers will be coming so handle th... um, invite them.

4248
03:31:12,940 --> 03:31:15,140
I don't know how to do this, can you teach me.

4249
03:31:13,780 --> 03:31:15,710
Oh, you won't teach us?

4250
03:31:15,140 --> 03:31:17,110
If you just watch me, you will be fine

4251
03:31:19,610 --> 03:31:21,980
Welcome, we will keep this for you.

4252
03:31:19,610 --> 03:31:21,980
Yes.

4253
03:31:22,080 --> 03:31:26,810

You guys say it too.

We're not suppose to screw up like that though.

4259
03:31:33,440 --> 03:31:37,010
You guys say it correctly too. Start from the next customer.

4260
03:31:37,110 --> 03:31:39,610
Next Passenger Is Checking In

4261

Please enjoy the comfortable journey in the sky.

4271
03:31:50,740 --> 03:31:52,540
Endo, be sure to say it correctly to the next customer.

4272
03:31:51,780 --> 03:31:52,440
Yes.

4273
03:31:56,340 --> 03:32:00,640
Next Passenger Is Checking In

4274
03:31:56,710 --> 03:31:57,840
Isn't it written?

4275
03:32:02,810 --> 03:32:06,240
Somehow They React To The Passengers

4276
03:32:07,610 --> 03:32:08,040
It's his family.

4277
03:32:08,410 --> 03:32:09,440
Family?  No way.

4278
03:32:09,640 --> 03:32:14,080
The Endo Family Is Checking In

4279
03:32:11,210 --> 03:32:13,510
This is the Endo family.

4280
03:32:14,110 --> 03:32:16,410
They are his mother, father, and younger brother.

4281
03:32:19,480 --> 03:32:21,410
Oh hey Shozo.

4282
03:32:21,410 --> 03:32:22,740
How are you?

4283
03:32:22,740 --> 03:32:24,010
Long time no see.

4284
03:32:23,080 --> 03:32:23,940
Yes.

4285
03:32:24,310 --> 03:32:25,810
Hello, nice to meet you.

4286
03:32:25,810 --> 03:32:28,910
I am the father of Cocorico Endo.  Thank you for taking care of him.

4287
03:32:25,810 --> 03:32:28,940
Toshihide-san (Father)

4288
03:32:28,910 --> 03:32:30,110
Hello.

4289
03:32:30,210 --> 03:32:31,610
Nice to meet you.

4290
03:32:31,640 --> 03:32:33,010
Nice to meet you

4291
03:32:31,940 --> 03:32:33,340
Wait a second.

4292
03:32:33,410 --> 03:32:35,140
Nice to meet you?

4293
03:32:34,010 --> 03:32:35,410
I'm sorry.

4294
03:32:35,410 --> 03:32:37,280
Sorry.

4295
03:32:38,910 --> 03:32:40,740
He wasn't really trying to make us get hurt.

4296
03:32:40,740 --> 03:32:42,610
What kind of person is he?

4297
03:32:46,780 --> 03:32:50,710
Hamada-san, it's been a year.  Long time no see.

4298
03:32:47,680 --> 03:32:48,080
Yes.

4299
03:32:48,910 --> 03:32:50,640
It's been a year..

4300
03:32:50,710 --> 03:32:52,040
Thank you very much.

4301
03:32:53,310 --> 03:32:55,480
Tanaka-kun, long time no see.

4302
03:32:55,480 --> 03:32:58,140
Thank you always for being my son's friend.  Thank you very much.

4303
03:32:57,010 --> 03:32:58,510
Thank you, I'm glad to.

4304
03:32:58,140 --> 03:33:00,410
My hair has become so thin like this.

4305
03:33:01,280 --> 03:33:03,380
Look at this

4306
03:33:03,380 --> 03:33:05,480
What are you saying?

4307
03:33:04,440 --> 03:33:05,480
Heh Heh heh

4308
03:33:05,980 --> 03:33:10,010
The Endo Family's True Colors

4309
03:33:11,480 --> 03:33:12,510
What the hell.

4310
03:33:12,280 --> 03:33:14,280
Weird atmosphere.

4311
03:33:13,310 --> 03:33:15,310
Please proceed to the 2nd gate.

4312
03:33:16,140 --> 03:33:19,810
Is this ad-lib?

4313
03:33:17,540 --> 03:33:19,340
OK, now please proceed to the 2nd gate.

4314
03:33:23,410 --> 03:33:26,310
I'm sorry the 2nd gate please.

4315
03:33:26,310 --> 03:33:27,740
Nice to meet you.

4316
03:33:28,740 --> 03:33:31,940
Hamada-san, nice to meet you.  I am his younger brother.

4317
03:33:29,710 --> 03:33:31,240
You should all do it together.

4318
03:33:32,910 --> 03:33:35,010
Matsumoto-san, thank you for everything.

4319
03:33:35,010 --> 03:33:38,680
I am Endo's younger brother, um ..... Junji.

4320
03:33:38,680 --> 03:33:42,580
He Totally Forgot His Name

4321
03:33:44,010 --> 03:33:45,540
That is not good.

4322
03:33:45,540 --> 03:33:46,280
Wait a second.

4323
03:33:48,710 --> 03:33:51,180
It's surprising that he forgot his own name.

4324
03:33:51,510 --> 03:33:53,180
Ah sorry brother.

4325
03:33:53,740 --> 03:33:56,540
There is a letter from mom.

4326
03:33:55,810 --> 03:33:59,340
A letter from his mother Kimiyo to Shozo

4327
03:33:57,110 --> 03:33:59,010
Try reading it.

4328
03:33:57,680 --> 03:33:59,010
Can I read it?

4329
03:33:59,010 --> 03:34:01,540
Dear Shozo,

4330
03:34:01,540 --> 03:34:05,810
Four years have passed since you broke up with Chiaki-chan,

4331
03:34:05,810 --> 03:34:10,110
how are you with your new girlfriend, Masami-san?

4332
03:34:09,040 --> 03:34:10,240
Don't say her name

4333
03:34:10,110 --> 03:34:13,910
And I read in a magazine that,

4334
03:34:13,910 --> 03:34:18,240
Masami-san is in her late 20's and used to be a beautiful manager.

4335
03:34:18,240 --> 03:34:22,140
Right now, you guys live together?

4336
03:34:22,140 --> 03:34:26,580
If so, please remarry as soon as you can and attain new happiness.

4337
03:34:26,680 --> 03:34:28,780
I have never told you this until now but

4338
03:34:28,810 --> 03:34:33,940
when you were in junior high school, I went into your room

4339
03:34:33,940 --> 03:34:38,110
and I found a fetish adult magazine.

4340
03:34:38,110 --> 03:34:42,440
I felt gloomy after the discovery.

4341
03:34:42,440 --> 03:34:50,180
Please don't do weird things to your girlfriend.

4342
03:34:49,540 --> 03:34:49,910
What kind of..

4343
03:34:50,180 --> 03:34:52,680
Um, what are you saying?

4344
03:34:51,110 --> 03:34:52,680
What are you talking about, mother.

4345
03:34:53,080 --> 03:34:55,180
Don't do weird things.

4346
03:35:00,780 --> 03:35:02,240
That wasn't something new to hear.
- No.

4347
03:35:08,710 --> 03:35:11,610
OK now we'll be going.

4348
03:35:09,610 --> 03:35:11,180
Now we are going to our vacation.

4349
03:35:11,180 --> 03:35:14,210
Oh, thank you very much.

4350
03:35:14,780 --> 03:35:17,440
Bye bi

4351
03:35:17,440 --> 03:35:18,410
They didn't laugh

4352
03:35:18,710 --> 03:35:22,010
Well your mother was amazing, she has guts.

4353
03:35:20,940 --> 03:35:22,080
Yes that's true.

4354
03:35:22,010 --> 03:35:26,510
She is like the bravest one.

4355
03:35:24,340 --> 03:35:26,110
Yes yes.

4356
03:35:26,710 --> 03:35:28,640
I'm sorry everyone.

4357
03:35:28,640 --> 03:35:30,310
Sorry about that

4358
03:35:28,880 --> 03:35:30,110
Not at all, it's been awhile.

4359
03:35:31,580 --> 03:35:36,740
Next Passenger Is Checking In

4360
03:35:38,540 --> 03:35:39,340
Excuse me

4361
03:35:39,640 --> 03:35:41,110
May I have your name?

4362
03:35:42,310 --> 03:35:44,310
Kuu?

4363
03:35:45,180 --> 03:35:46,440
It's KOO.

4364
03:35:48,580 --> 03:35:50,080
Koo.

4365
03:35:50,210 --> 03:35:51,780
Koo-san.

4366
03:35:55,580 --> 03:35:57,180
What is he wearing?

4367
03:35:58,240 --> 03:36:00,580
I'm looking for an ATM...

4368
03:36:01,410 --> 03:36:01,980
Well..

4369
03:36:03,080 --> 03:36:05,910
Walk straight then at the far end

4370
03:36:05,910 --> 03:36:08,280
turn right.

4371
03:36:06,610 --> 03:36:07,910
Right?

4372
03:36:08,380 --> 03:36:10,140
There will be two machines.

4373
03:36:10,240 --> 03:36:12,010
Thank you.

4374
03:36:22,110 --> 03:36:23,810
Here it comes.

4375
03:36:25,410 --> 03:36:29,840
Next Passenger Is Checking In

4376
03:36:27,680 --> 03:36:29,440
32-D means..

4377
03:36:29,440 --> 03:36:32,840
it's an isle seat, doesn't it?

4378
03:36:29,940 --> 03:36:32,940
Nishio Kazuo (Tomochika)

4379
03:36:29,940 --> 03:36:32,940
Pizza Cap

4380
03:36:32,840 --> 03:36:36,480
When I called, I said I wanted a front window seat.

4381
03:36:36,680 --> 03:36:39,280
Then when I came here and received my ticket from the machine,

4382
03:36:39,280 --> 03:36:42,080
it said 32-D.  So I was like "What the hell is going on!"

4383
03:36:42,080 --> 03:36:44,340
I asked the staff, and they kept telling me to check with the other sections.

4384
03:36:44,340 --> 03:36:46,780
I was given the runaround, so I asked them if this was the City hall!

4385
03:36:53,980 --> 03:36:58,340
Claim On Passenger Service

4386
03:36:55,540 --> 03:36:56,710
It's a complainer.

4387
03:36:56,980 --> 03:36:58,140
Yeah, it seems so.

4388
03:36:59,740 --> 03:37:03,980
I have relatives in Kyushu, and I run a pizza shop here.

4389
03:37:03,980 --> 03:37:07,110
There will be a lot of people there, so I told them I would bring an L-sized pizza.

4390
03:37:08,010 --> 03:37:10,340
So I asked if I could carry it on the plane,

4391
03:37:10,340 --> 03:37:12,480
and they said they were afraid of the smell.

4392
03:37:12,480 --> 03:37:14,740
They said it will be too smelly to bring it in the plane.

4393
03:37:14,740 --> 03:37:20,440
And that it will be disgusting because it is all seafood!

4394
03:37:20,380 --> 03:37:22,110
It's not disgusting.

4395
03:37:24,180 --> 03:37:25,440
It's OK.

4396
03:37:25,510 --> 03:37:29,380
You can just get hot pizza in Kyuushu.

4397
03:37:35,180 --> 03:37:36,840
Awful customer

4398
03:37:35,910 --> 03:37:37,210
Thinking about everyone,

4399
03:37:37,210 --> 03:37:42,180
I told them to just deliver it on the plane then.

4400
03:37:42,180 --> 03:37:43,780
I won't carry in on with me!

4401
03:37:43,780 --> 03:37:45,910
Everyone will get sick because of the seafood, saying it's disgusting.

4402
03:37:45,910 --> 03:37:51,440
I feel sick!

4403
03:37:46,940 --> 03:37:51,440
Gross!

4404
03:37:47,640 --> 03:37:51,440
Bunch of idiots!

4405
03:37:55,980 --> 03:37:57,880
Feel sick?

4406
03:38:00,780 --> 03:38:01,980
It hurts!

4407
03:38:03,640 --> 03:38:05,510
Keep it nice, OK?

4408
03:38:05,510 --> 03:38:05,880
Yes.

4409
03:38:06,040 --> 03:38:08,540
Do it right, idiots!

4410
03:38:10,510 --> 03:38:12,610
He's a claimer.

4411
03:38:20,380 --> 03:38:23,410
The Zombies Reappear

4412
03:38:33,740 --> 03:38:37,040
Zombie Itao Appears

4413
03:38:35,410 --> 03:38:36,940
This must have taken time.

4414
03:38:41,140 --> 03:38:42,480
It's Itao-san, right.

4415
03:38:43,240 --> 03:38:45,180
Serious?

4416
03:38:50,640 --> 03:38:53,040
Ouch!  It's getting tougher.

4417
03:38:54,240 --> 03:38:55,510
So what's the meaning of this?

4418
03:38:55,510 --> 03:38:58,580
If you get bitten by a Zombie,

4419
03:38:57,210 --> 03:38:58,580
you become one too.

4420
03:38:58,580 --> 03:39:01,510
Then he got bitten!

4421
03:39:00,510 --> 03:39:01,010
It's so scary.

4422
03:39:01,510 --> 03:39:04,740
Don't you think you should call the police?

4423
03:39:06,980 --> 03:39:07,910
9:00 pm.

4424
03:39:10,180 --> 03:39:13,710
Without any break, they head to their next assignment.

4425
03:39:11,310 --> 03:39:20,680
Exercise Control Over Dangerous Articles

4426
03:39:11,310 --> 03:39:20,710
Security Check Duty

4427
03:39:14,110 --> 03:39:16,680
They are going to the security check point

4428
03:39:17,410 --> 03:39:18,910
where carry-on bags are checked.

4429
03:39:20,110 --> 03:39:22,410
Your names are written.  Hamada is front.

4430
03:39:21,410 --> 03:39:29,110
Security Check

4431
03:39:24,410 --> 03:39:27,780
Since you guys can't, the security officers will check the baggage.

4432
03:39:27,780 --> 03:39:29,510
Can you sit here and watch?

4433
03:39:29,740 --> 03:39:32,810
I think us watching won't accomplish anything.

4434
03:39:38,280 --> 03:39:41,480
(Yamaguchi Tomomitsu)

4435
03:39:38,280 --> 03:39:41,480
Hickson Gracie

4436
03:39:43,910 --> 03:39:47,210
I'm going to check my baggage-son

4437
03:39:45,480 --> 03:39:47,210
Hickson

4438
03:39:46,280 --> 03:39:47,210
Hickson

4439
03:39:47,210 --> 03:39:48,980
Hickson

4440
03:39:47,510 --> 03:39:48,980
I'm passing the gate-son

4441
03:39:48,880 --> 03:39:51,810
Why?  Why Hickson?

4442
03:39:48,980 --> 03:39:51,010
Hickson

4443
03:39:49,780 --> 03:39:51,010
Hickson

4444
03:39:50,740 --> 03:39:51,010
Hickson

4445
03:39:51,010 --> 03:39:53,610
This is Hickson

4446
03:39:54,540 --> 03:39:55,880
Long time no see-son.

4447
03:39:57,080 --> 03:39:58,380
Can I check your baggage?

4448
03:40:09,210 --> 03:40:13,480
Hickson VS Guitar

4449
03:40:21,380 --> 03:40:23,410
Why Hickson?

4450
03:40:25,510 --> 03:40:27,440
It's dangerous.

4451
03:40:26,480 --> 03:40:27,440
Yes.

4452
03:40:29,010 --> 03:40:32,840
It's your own guitar, right?

4453
03:40:29,110 --> 03:40:34,540
Hickson VS Guitar Continues

4454
03:40:36,680 --> 03:40:38,140
Hickson retired..

4455
03:40:41,280 --> 03:40:42,410
Dangerous person.

4456
03:40:45,940 --> 03:40:47,840
That was very high.

4457
03:40:50,440 --> 03:40:51,240
No good.

4458
03:40:51,240 --> 03:40:53,140
He shouldn't do it.

4459
03:40:53,140 --> 03:40:54,980
Yeah he shouldn't.

4460
03:40:56,480 --> 03:40:58,710
What is he doing?

4461
03:41:01,240 --> 03:41:02,810
It's a regular guitar.

4462
03:41:08,680 --> 03:41:12,810
Hickson Gracie Hickson Gracie

4463
03:41:12,810 --> 03:41:17,480
Anytime Anywhere Hickson Gracie

4464
03:41:17,480 --> 03:41:21,910
My name is Hickson Gracie

4465
03:41:19,410 --> 03:41:21,340
He's so cheerful.

4466
03:41:23,080 --> 03:41:24,480
He's having fun.

4467
03:41:26,040 --> 03:41:27,710
Hurry up and board the plane.

4468
03:41:28,680 --> 03:41:30,310
He was playing quietly during this time.

4469
03:41:31,010 --> 03:41:32,380
He was waiting.

4470
03:41:35,840 --> 03:41:38,180
Hickson Gracie

4471
03:41:38,210 --> 03:41:43,110
Anytime, it's Hickson Gracie

4472
03:41:43,080 --> 03:41:47,010
Happy and fun Hickson Gracie

4473
03:41:48,880 --> 03:41:51,740
Isn't he making a mistake of the meaning of Hickson?

4474
03:41:57,610 --> 03:41:59,310
What the hell.

4475
03:42:04,110 --> 03:42:08,610
A White Wig From His Baggage

4476
03:42:11,510 --> 03:42:13,780
Even if you say so..

4477
03:42:13,780 --> 03:42:19,440
I have never sang anywhere like here.

4478
03:42:13,780 --> 03:42:22,380
Mimicking
Kuwana Masahiro

4479
03:42:25,440 --> 03:42:27,980
Stop it.

4480
03:42:28,780 --> 03:42:30,580
I don't mind

4481
03:42:30,580 --> 03:42:33,740
to go on singing, carrying my guitar.

4482
03:42:33,740 --> 03:42:37,140
It's embarrassing to sing in a place like this.

4483
03:42:37,340 --> 03:42:39,310
"Light of the moon"

4484
03:42:40,710 --> 03:42:46,340
Security Check Becomes A Live Concert!

4485
03:42:55,410 --> 03:42:56,780
He tried too hard.

4486
03:42:56,780 --> 03:43:00,940
* They have already laughed, but please keep watching.

4487
03:43:01,380 --> 03:43:04,380
~　♪

4488
03:43:06,010 --> 03:43:09,710
That's too much!

4489
03:43:10,480 --> 03:43:12,880
Nothing like him!

4490
03:43:25,840 --> 03:43:27,510
Over exaggeration.

4491
03:43:31,080 --> 03:43:33,840
It hurts.

4492
03:43:38,140 --> 03:43:40,540
Hickson

4493
03:43:38,940 --> 03:43:40,540

Hickson

4495
03:43:42,340 --> 03:43:44,640
Some people are strange.

4496
03:43:45,410 --> 03:43:49,410
Security Check

4497
03:43:46,640 --> 03:43:48,640
Looks bad, huh.

4498
03:43:51,980 --> 03:43:55,480
Foreigner Trying To Pass Unchecked

03:43:59,580 --> 03:44:03,480

Officer Pissed At Passenger's Attitude

4502
03:44:22,680 --> 03:44:26,380
Punished Him With A Slap

4503
03:44:29,280 --> 03:44:35,610
* They have already laughed, but please keep watching.

4504
03:44:38,110 --> 03:44:40,180
Why.. does he act so crazy.

4505
03:44:41,440 --> 03:44:42,640
Watch out.

4506
03:44:46,940 --> 03:44:51,540
Officer's Madness Is Getting Out Of Control

4507
03:44:54,010 --> 03:44:55,540
What a mess.

4508
03:45:02,640 --> 03:45:03,810
I think he will be reprimanded.

4509
03:45:09,480 --> 03:45:11,880
He should be OUT.

4510
03:45:13,980 --> 03:45:15,080
What a mess.

4511
03:45:19,740 --> 03:45:22,480
Some people are really crazy.

4512
03:45:20,980 --> 03:45:22,580
Really yes.

4513
03:45:21,810 --> 03:45:24,280
It was an officer, right?

4514
03:45:24,980 --> 03:45:30,780
Japanese officers are still reliable, huh.

4515
03:45:27,410 --> 03:45:30,780
What made you think so?

4516
03:45:32,110 --> 03:45:36,280
11:00 pm, it's been 14 hours since the start of the duty.

4517
03:45:36,810 --> 03:45:37,810
Going up?

4518
03:45:38,340 --> 03:45:41,640
The 5 members are attending a meeting

4519
03:45:38,340 --> 03:45:48,410
Attending The Debriefing

4520
03:45:41,640 --> 03:45:45,180
to discuss how to create a better airport.

4521
03:45:45,740 --> 03:45:47,940
However, there..

4522
03:45:48,740 --> 03:45:53,110
2F Meeting Room

4523
03:45:50,180 --> 03:45:52,380
Come on in.

4524
03:45:51,240 --> 03:45:52,380
Here they are.

4525
03:45:53,580 --> 03:45:57,740
Can you sit down there?

4526
03:46:03,040 --> 03:46:05,040
Please learn from them.

4527
03:46:05,740 --> 03:46:08,740
Now we are going to start

4528
03:46:08,740 --> 03:46:13,840
the airport black list debriefing meeting.

4529
03:46:12,010 --> 03:46:13,480
Yes.

4530
03:46:13,840 --> 03:46:17,740
We are going to list problematic celebrities and put them on a black list.

4531
03:46:14,310 --> 03:46:24,480
Blacklist Meeting

4532
03:46:14,310 --> 03:46:24,480
To avoid future problems, create a black list of problematic Passengers (celebrities)

4533
03:46:17,740 --> 03:46:20,640
So please report if you have anyone in mind.

4534
03:46:20,710 --> 03:46:21,310
OK.

4535
03:46:21,310 --> 03:46:24,410
Does anyone know of a suspicious celebrity?

4536
03:46:24,410 --> 03:46:25,910
Please make a report.

4537
03:46:26,310 --> 03:46:26,940
I have one.

4538
03:46:26,980 --> 03:46:27,580
OK.

4539
03:46:27,910 --> 03:46:29,180
Well...

4540
03:46:29,180 --> 03:46:31,180
In this world, there are a lot of scary things.

4541
03:46:31,180 --> 03:46:32,380
Yes.

4542
03:46:31,180 --> 03:46:34,040
Right?  As it says "Earthquake, Thunder, Fire and Father."

4543
03:46:34,040 --> 03:46:37,940
What scares comedians the most is,

4544
03:46:37,940 --> 03:46:40,780
if after your gag, there is total silence.

4545
03:46:40,080 --> 03:46:41,040
Yes.

4546
03:46:40,840 --> 03:46:43,680
The other day, the broadcast writer Takasu's wedding reception was held.

4547
03:46:44,210 --> 03:46:47,580
Katsumata-san was there at the reception sitting in his seat,

4548
03:46:47,610 --> 03:46:50,540
Yamasaki-san came and sat next to him.

4549
03:46:50,540 --> 03:46:52,280
Yamasaki Housei-san.

4550
03:46:50,940 --> 03:47:47,180
Yamasaki's Secret

4551
03:46:50,940 --> 03:47:47,210
#1 At Wedding Reception

4552
03:46:52,280 --> 03:46:53,780
Then he..

4553
03:46:53,780 --> 03:46:56,410
when everyone else was wearing formal suits,

4554
03:46:56,410 --> 03:46:58,910
it was about this size,

4555
03:46:58,910 --> 03:47:03,980
he was wearing a costume of "Eyeball Old Man".

4556
03:47:01,710 --> 03:47:07,710
Eyeball Old Man

4557
03:47:03,810 --> 03:47:05,040
In full costume?

4558
03:47:04,380 --> 03:47:05,040
Yes.

4559
03:47:05,040 --> 03:47:07,110
He was asked to give a speech in front of everyone.

4560
03:47:08,640 --> 03:47:12,840
But it was supposed to be planned for the latter half of the reception.

4561
03:47:13,510 --> 03:47:17,210
So from the beginning, the costume was lame.

4562
03:47:18,310 --> 03:47:21,440
Actually, not even one person reacted.

4563
03:47:23,580 --> 03:47:25,080
It's so lame.  He failed.

4564
03:47:26,140 --> 03:47:28,810
Then the reception started, and we were served our meal.

4565
03:47:28,810 --> 03:47:31,040
It seemed like the big eyeball costume was bothering him.

4566
03:47:31,040 --> 03:47:33,810
He took it off and..

4567
03:47:33,810 --> 03:47:36,280
started having his meal.

4568
03:47:36,280 --> 03:47:38,680
Once he took it off,

4569
03:47:38,680 --> 03:47:40,810
from the neck down,

4570
03:47:40,810 --> 03:47:44,540
he was wearing a gray shirt and gray long underwear.

4571
03:47:45,480 --> 03:47:47,640
So his attire looked so rude.

4572
03:47:54,780 --> 03:47:56,240
Unbelievable huh.

4573
03:47:57,280 --> 03:47:59,640
I was there

4574
03:47:59,480 --> 03:48:01,540
I was there, too.

4575
03:48:00,810 --> 03:48:01,540
Really?

4576
03:48:01,540 --> 03:48:05,180
Then he completely slipped up his speech.

4577
03:48:01,580 --> 03:48:09,380
#2 At Wedding Reception

4578
03:48:01,580 --> 03:48:09,380
Yamasaki's Secret

4579
03:48:14,380 --> 03:48:17,080
We stayed in the waiting room before the 2nd part of the reception started,

4580
03:48:15,780 --> 03:48:54,780
#2 At Wedding Reception

4581
03:48:15,780 --> 03:48:54,780
Yamasaki's Secret

4582
03:48:17,110 --> 03:48:22,310
there were Cocorico-san, Kimura-san, Matsumoto-san and Yamasaki-san.

4583
03:48:22,310 --> 03:48:25,040
In the small room, we were drinking some water.

4584
03:48:25,440 --> 03:48:28,640
Was it so bad?  Was it so bad?

4585
03:48:28,640 --> 03:48:30,310
He kept asking over and over.

4586
03:48:30,310 --> 03:48:31,480
Of course it was.

4587
03:48:31,480 --> 03:48:34,310
Cocorico-san said so too.

4588
03:48:35,480 --> 03:48:37,010
Yeah, even though they were juniors.

4589
03:48:37,380 --> 03:48:40,580
Then Matsumoto-san said some kind words to him, saying

4590
03:48:40,610 --> 03:48:45,040
If asked who they wanted to become in their future, you or me,

4591
03:48:45,080 --> 03:48:47,340
some people would say "Yamasaki".

4592
03:48:47,340 --> 03:48:48,380
Then Yamasaki asked,

4593
03:48:48,880 --> 03:48:50,480
What about you, Endo?

4594
03:48:50,480 --> 03:48:52,540
I want to be Matsumoto-san.

4595
03:48:52,540 --> 03:48:53,640
What about you, Tanaka?

4596
03:48:53,640 --> 03:48:55,110
I want to be Matsumoto-san.

4597
03:49:00,640 --> 03:49:02,910
Don't make is sound like that, stupid.

4598
03:49:06,210 --> 03:49:06,910
It's the reality.

4599
03:49:07,640 --> 03:49:08,910
It can't be helped.

4600
03:49:09,780 --> 03:49:10,740
That's only natural.

4601
03:49:10,740 --> 03:49:12,740
It's the reality.

4602
03:49:13,840 --> 03:49:15,210
Yamasaki-san,

4603
03:49:15,540 --> 03:49:17,240
before he gave a speech,

4604
03:49:15,610 --> 03:49:34,840
#3 At Wedding Reception

4605
03:49:15,610 --> 03:49:34,840
Yamasaki's Secret

4606
03:49:17,340 --> 03:49:22,680
Everyone got excited when musicians like Tortoise-san, Suga-san or Okuda-san sang.

4607
03:49:19,110 --> 03:49:25,640
Tortoise
Matsumoto

4608

Sugashi Kao

4609
03:49:21,080 --> 03:49:25,640
Okuda Tamio

4610
03:49:22,680 --> 03:49:25,280
Then the celebrities and comedians at the tables

4611
03:49:25,280 --> 03:49:28,580
started talking and it made everyone laugh.

4612
03:49:28,580 --> 03:49:31,140
We were having a French dinner course,

4613
03:49:31,140 --> 03:49:35,140
but he ordered hot sake from the waiter.

4614
03:49:53,510 --> 03:49:56,480
We have a report from someone who couldn't make it today as well.

4615
03:49:56,480 --> 03:49:58,910
It's from Iwahashi, Plus Minus.

4616
03:49:57,480 --> 03:50:06,340

4618
03:49:59,910 --> 03:50:02,210
I'm reporting about a person called Hamada.

4619
03:50:02,210 --> 03:50:05,980
At his son's birthday, he bought

4620
03:50:02,610 --> 03:50:11,110
At Son's Birthday...

4621
03:50:02,610 --> 03:50:11,110
Hamada's Secret

4622
03:50:05,980 --> 03:50:07,540
Red Wing boots as a gift.

4623
03:50:08,040 --> 03:50:11,410
But the size was totally wrong and now he himself wears them.

4624
03:50:19,310 --> 03:50:21,480
What is it?

4625
03:50:21,480 --> 03:50:23,040
He's so stupid.

4626
03:50:23,010 --> 03:50:24,380
So stupid.

4627
03:50:25,640 --> 03:50:27,680
Can it happen?

4628
03:50:30,740 --> 03:50:33,010
When buying shoes, the size is most important.

4629
03:50:36,740 --> 03:50:39,410
Someone called Matsumoto-san..

4630
03:50:39,410 --> 03:50:43,610
This is reported from his wife's friend.

4631
03:50:43,610 --> 03:50:46,540
Someone called Matsumoto-san..

4632
03:50:46,540 --> 03:50:50,040
This is reported from his wife's friend.

4633
03:50:46,740 --> 03:50:53,140

Provided by

4635
03:50:50,040 --> 03:50:51,380
I heard..

4636
03:50:51,380 --> 03:50:52,940
his wife and daughter are

4637
03:50:52,940 --> 03:50:55,910
learning English at home lately.

4638
03:50:55,910 --> 03:50:57,340
His daughter keeps saying

4639
03:50:56,240 --> 03:51:17,040
Matsumoto's Secret

4640
03:50:56,240 --> 03:51:17,040
Wife & Daughter learn English...

4641
03:50:57,340 --> 03:50:59,880
Giraffe!  Giraffe!

4642
03:50:59,880 --> 03:51:01,880
So Matsumoto asked what's Giraffe,

4643
03:51:01,910 --> 03:51:04,140
because he didn't know what it was.

4644
03:51:04,140 --> 03:51:06,440
It's Kirin (in Japanese).  His wife told him.

4645
03:51:05,280 --> 03:51:14,240
Kirin (Giraffe)

4646
03:51:07,010 --> 03:51:09,010
Is Kirin called Giraffe in English?

4647
03:51:09,010 --> 03:51:11,180
I don't get it at all.  What is it?

4648
03:51:11,180 --> 03:51:12,310
What is it?

4649
03:51:12,310 --> 03:51:14,480
I don't get it at all.

4650
03:51:15,010 --> 03:51:17,310
He kept repeating it over and over.

4651
03:51:20,910 --> 03:51:22,510
What kind of report is that?

4652
03:51:26,380 --> 03:51:28,280
What kind of..

4653
03:51:28,280 --> 03:51:30,110
So he didn't get it at all.

4654
03:51:33,510 --> 03:51:35,280
It's called giraffe.  It can't be helped.

4655
03:51:36,210 --> 03:51:41,340
It doesn't matter if you get it or not.  Giraffe is Kirin.

4656
03:51:39,210 --> 03:51:40,810
He has to accept it.

4657
03:51:42,410 --> 03:51:43,710
Speaking of his child,

4658
03:51:43,710 --> 03:51:48,910
I heard this from Ameagari's Miyasako, but..

4659
03:51:45,040 --> 03:52:26,310
Daughter's Story...

4660
03:51:45,040 --> 03:52:26,310
Matsumoto's Secret

4661
03:51:49,680 --> 03:51:52,440
The genius comedian, Matsumoto Hitoshi

4662
03:51:52,440 --> 03:51:56,910
never tells a story without having a twist ending.

4663
03:51:56,910 --> 03:51:58,210
He surely does so on TV shows and

4664
03:51:58,210 --> 03:52:01,880
also during his private time.

4665
03:52:01,880 --> 03:52:03,880
One day, he was talking about his child,

4666
03:52:05,110 --> 03:52:07,980
When I run after her, screaming "Wahh!"

4667
03:52:07,980 --> 03:52:10,480
she screams and runs away.

4668
03:52:10,910 --> 03:52:15,210
And when I was reading a book for awhile, she started watching me...

4669
03:52:15,210 --> 03:52:18,810
So I  say "Wahh!" then she again screams and runs away.

4670
03:52:18,810 --> 03:52:21,010
It continues forever.

4671
03:52:21,410 --> 03:52:23,810
Then in the end he said,

4672
03:52:24,240 --> 03:52:26,380
I'm no match for her.

4673
03:52:33,340 --> 03:52:35,040
Can it be?

4674
03:52:36,180 --> 03:52:38,310
No twist ending.  Nothing funny.

4675
03:52:40,240 --> 03:52:42,540
It can happen, huh?

4676
03:52:41,140 --> 03:52:42,540
It seems so.

4677
03:52:42,540 --> 03:52:44,410
Anything else?

4678
03:52:44,410 --> 03:52:45,480
Well...

4679
03:52:45,480 --> 03:52:47,910
Let me talk about Hamada-san from Downtown.

4680
03:52:47,910 --> 03:52:52,440
I heard this from his family, so this is from a reliable source.

4681
03:52:48,810 --> 03:52:53,980
Hamada's family

4682
03:52:48,810 --> 03:52:53,980
Provided by

4683
03:52:53,180 --> 03:52:56,110
I heard, every New years, the Hamada family

4684

Hamada's Secret

4685
03:52:54,180 --> 03:53:50,340
On New Yeah's Family Trip...

4686
03:52:56,110 --> 03:52:58,580
along with the High-heel Momoko-san family

4687
03:52:58,580 --> 03:53:00,140
goes on a trip.

4688
03:52:58,840 --> 03:53:03,580
High Heel Momoko

4689
03:53:00,140 --> 03:53:02,480
One year, they went to Australia.

4690
03:53:02,480 --> 03:53:05,080
Australia is famous for koala bears.

4691
03:53:05,080 --> 03:53:08,710
So Hamada-san was happy to hold a koala bear.

4692
03:53:08,710 --> 03:53:11,480
His wife and sons were next to him.

4693
03:53:11,480 --> 03:53:14,110
When they were about to shoot a commemorative photo,

4694
03:53:14,110 --> 03:53:16,380
travelers from Japan found him.

4695
03:53:16,380 --> 03:53:18,980
And it became a big crowd.

4696
03:53:18,980 --> 03:53:22,540
And they started taking pictures using their cellphones or digital cameras.  Pictures of his family.

4697
03:53:22,540 --> 03:53:24,140
Then of course Hamada-san

4698
03:53:24,140 --> 03:53:25,610
tried to protect his family,

4699
03:53:25,610 --> 03:53:30,240
and screamed to the crowd.  Then in that exact moment their commemorative photo was shot.

4700
03:53:30,240 --> 03:53:32,010
When the guide gave them the photo,

4701
03:53:32,010 --> 03:53:33,680
and they saw how it came out,

4702
03:53:33,680 --> 03:53:36,510
of course his wife and sons were embarrassed

4703
03:53:36,510 --> 03:53:38,040
and looking down.

4704
03:53:38,040 --> 03:53:39,910
But Hamada-san

4705
03:53:39,910 --> 03:53:41,280
was so mad at the moment,

4706
03:53:41,280 --> 03:53:45,240
but he was fully smiling to the camera.

4707
03:53:45,240 --> 03:53:48,280
But the koala bear he was holding thought that he was an enemy,

4708
03:53:48,280 --> 03:53:50,540
and was biting his arm.

4709
03:53:54,780 --> 03:53:56,480
That's how the photo came out.

4710
03:53:56,480 --> 03:53:59,040
That koala bear?

4711
03:53:58,040 --> 03:53:59,040
Yes.

4712
03:53:59,040 --> 03:54:01,640
Enough about Hamada.

4713
03:54:03,410 --> 03:54:05,510
Add him to the list.

4714
03:54:05,510 --> 03:54:06,740
Speaking of family,

4715
03:54:06,740 --> 03:54:09,980
sorry for continuing family talk but

4716
03:54:09,980 --> 03:54:11,340
Well..

4717
03:54:11,340 --> 03:54:14,380
Endo-kun got married and divorced.

4718
03:54:13,240 --> 03:54:45,380
Endo's Secret

4719
03:54:13,240 --> 03:54:45,380
Main Factor Of Divorce...

4720
03:54:14,380 --> 03:54:15,710
And

4721
03:54:15,710 --> 03:54:18,310
according to Katsumata, he asked Chiaki

4722
03:54:16,810 --> 03:54:23,310
Chiaki

4723
03:54:16,810 --> 03:54:23,310
Provided by

4724
03:54:18,310 --> 03:54:20,310
what's the main factor of their divorce.

4725
03:54:20,310 --> 03:54:23,310
It's basically because of their relationship,

4726
03:54:23,880 --> 03:54:25,910
but one of the main factors is

4727
03:54:25,910 --> 03:54:27,140
that Endo-kun

4728
03:54:27,140 --> 03:54:29,510
can't recite the alphabets.

4729
03:54:30,810 --> 03:54:32,310
Can it be?

4730
03:54:32,310 --> 03:54:35,310
So I asked him to say it.  He was good in the beginning.

4731
03:54:35,310 --> 03:54:37,680
A B C D.. then

4732
03:54:37,680 --> 03:54:39,310
When he hit around L M,

4733
03:54:39,310 --> 03:54:41,340
L M M

4734
03:54:41,340 --> 03:54:43,180
From O P Q, it got strange.

4735
03:54:43,180 --> 03:54:45,580
And he quickly came to Z.

4736
03:54:51,580 --> 03:54:54,510
We can't let him fly in our plane.

4737
03:54:55,610 --> 03:54:57,610
It's surprising.

4738
03:54:58,080 --> 03:54:59,740
Excuse me, so Endo-san.

4739
03:55:00,440 --> 03:55:04,080
This is a story that I still don't know the answer.

4740
03:55:02,010 --> 03:55:13,780
Endo's Secret

4741
03:55:02,010 --> 03:55:13,780
Story With No Answer...

4742
03:55:04,110 --> 03:55:06,880
In the middle of the night, around 2am.

4743
03:55:06,880 --> 03:55:08,810
I got an text message and it said,

4744
03:55:08,810 --> 03:55:10,540
I feel a bit horny

4745
03:55:10,540 --> 03:55:12,310
so why don't you come over?

4746
03:55:12,310 --> 03:55:15,580
It was sent to me by mistake.

4747
03:55:22,440 --> 03:55:24,480
You're lame.

4748
03:55:24,980 --> 03:55:26,940
It's crazy.

4749
03:55:26,940 --> 03:55:28,580
It's crazy.

4750
03:55:28,580 --> 03:55:29,880
What are you doing?

4751
03:55:29,880 --> 03:55:31,710
Horny..

4752
03:55:31,710 --> 03:55:34,240
We don't know the truth.

4753
03:55:32,810 --> 03:55:34,240
No.

4754
03:55:34,240 --> 03:55:35,810
What kind of relationship is it?

4755
03:55:35,010 --> 03:55:36,510
That's crazy.

4756
03:55:38,580 --> 03:55:40,980
It's about Endo-san.

4757
03:55:41,640 --> 03:55:44,610
In his cell phone,

4758
03:55:41,810 --> 03:55:46,540
Cell phone...

4759
03:55:41,810 --> 03:55:46,540
Endo's Secret

4760
03:55:44,610 --> 03:55:46,740
he keeps a lot of weird adult movies.

4761
03:55:52,980 --> 03:55:55,410
Why do we have to hit for something like this!

4762
03:55:55,410 --> 03:55:56,440
Delete it!

4763
03:55:56,440 --> 03:55:57,240
Hey you.

4764
03:55:58,510 --> 03:56:00,410
If you didn't have adult movies in your cell phone..

4765
03:56:00,410 --> 03:56:02,010
We didn't have to get hit.

4766
03:56:02,010 --> 03:56:02,640
He is a super masochist.

4767
03:56:02,880 --> 03:56:05,280
That's mean.

4768
03:56:05,140 --> 03:56:07,110
He is a self-claimed super masochist that everyone admits.

4769
03:56:07,110 --> 03:56:08,940
Oh is he?

4770
03:56:09,480 --> 03:56:12,080
He often goes to the Sugamo area.

4771
03:56:10,040 --> 03:56:28,580
At Adult Shop In Sugamo...

4772
03:56:10,040 --> 03:56:28,580
Endo's Secret

4773
03:56:12,080 --> 03:56:15,740
He usually calls the woman's name with the honorific -san.

4774
03:56:15,740 --> 03:56:18,610
During their play, they used

4775
03:56:18,610 --> 03:56:20,610
some kind of toy.

4776
03:56:20,610 --> 03:56:24,610
And when the battery ran down, he thought it was still part of the play

4777
03:56:24,610 --> 03:56:28,780
and felt pleasure that she made him change the battery.

4778
03:56:34,040 --> 03:56:35,780
What the hell is that?

4779
03:56:36,210 --> 03:56:37,540
It's killing me!

4780
03:56:37,940 --> 03:56:38,980
This is killer!

4781
03:56:38,980 --> 03:56:40,610
It's hard.

4782
03:56:41,340 --> 03:56:43,540
Everything was awful.

4783
03:56:43,540 --> 03:56:44,840
He should be ranked S in the black list.

4784
03:56:45,910 --> 03:56:48,380
He's ranked an S.

4785
03:56:50,640 --> 03:56:54,080
I have a story about Yamasaki-san.

4786
03:56:54,080 --> 03:56:56,610
Well.. some years ago

4787
03:56:56,610 --> 03:57:01,240
he got a disease that only one out of millions will get, called Peyronie's disease.

4788
03:57:01,710 --> 03:57:06,680
Once you get it, your penis gets harder.

4789
03:57:01,940 --> 03:57:31,510
Peyronie's disease...

4790
03:57:01,940 --> 03:57:31,510
Yamasaki's Secret

4791
03:57:06,680 --> 03:57:09,610
When I went out for dinner with him,

4792
03:57:09,610 --> 03:57:11,510
he was quite drunk and

4793
03:57:11,510 --> 03:57:14,580
he started saying that he didn't need his penis any more

4794
03:57:14,580 --> 03:57:16,580
since he already had a kid.

4795
03:57:16,610 --> 03:57:20,440
He said he would cut it off and become like ***-san

4796
03:57:22,010 --> 03:57:24,880
So I told him that he wouldn't be able to become like ***-san even if he cut it off.

4797
03:57:24,880 --> 03:57:28,310
Then he said he would get something like spiritual power if he cut it off.

4798
03:57:28,310 --> 03:57:31,740
His words were pretty disrespectful to ***-san.

4799
03:57:40,280 --> 03:57:41,810
That's not how it is.

4800
03:57:44,040 --> 03:57:46,010
It hurts..

4801
03:57:46,010 --> 03:57:47,440
This is enough!

4802
03:57:47,440 --> 03:57:50,210
I have a story about Matsumoto Hitoshi.

4803
03:57:50,210 --> 03:57:52,310
At the dinner party,

4804
03:57:52,310 --> 03:57:56,740
Mimata Matazo asked Matsumoto for serious advice about a business.

4805
03:57:52,780 --> 03:58:21,040
During The Party...

4806
03:57:52,780 --> 03:58:21,040
Matsumoto's Secret

4807
03:57:56,710 --> 03:58:00,680
Mimata was running a shop in Roppongi for about 2 years, and closed it.

4808
03:58:01,280 --> 03:58:05,380
He told Matsumoto that he wanted to run a shop in Roppongi again if he had money.

4809
03:58:05,380 --> 03:58:07,480
Then..

4810
03:58:07,480 --> 03:58:08,980
Matsumoto Hitoshi said

4811
03:58:08,980 --> 03:58:12,740
he should try and do something different from Bar Matazo.

4812
03:58:12,740 --> 03:58:15,110
Then Mimata asked Matsumoto what would be good.

4813
03:58:15,140 --> 03:58:18,240
Then Matsumoto told him to run a sex delivery shop.

4814
03:58:18,240 --> 03:58:21,380
If you open a sex delivery shop, I'll pay for everything.

4815
03:58:33,080 --> 03:58:34,780
This is not good.

4816
03:58:36,310 --> 03:58:37,980
Mimata didn't know how to reject the offer.

4817
03:58:37,980 --> 03:58:42,010
At the time, Ameagari's Miyasako was there too.

4818
03:58:39,910 --> 03:58:51,580
During The Party...

4819
03:58:39,910 --> 03:58:51,610
Matsumoto's Secret

4820
03:58:41,980 --> 03:58:44,210
And he was listening to their talk.

4821
03:58:44,210 --> 03:58:46,710
They were actually talking about that.

4822
03:58:46,710 --> 03:58:49,410
In the end, looking at the sky, Matsumoto said

4823
03:58:49,780 --> 03:58:51,910
Let me decide the play menu.

4824
03:58:56,540 --> 03:58:58,240
Hey!

4825
03:58:58,240 --> 03:58:59,910
That's enough!

4826
03:59:00,310 --> 03:59:03,710
Scary.

4827
03:59:03,710 --> 03:59:05,880
A lot of people have been reported.

4828
03:59:07,510 --> 03:59:10,110
Can I report mine?

4829
03:59:08,810 --> 03:59:10,110
Well..

4830
03:59:10,110 --> 03:59:11,640
Mimata Matazo..

4831
03:59:11,640 --> 03:59:12,910
Yeah, Matazo.

4832
03:59:13,140 --> 03:59:57,180
Mimata's Secret

4833
03:59:13,140 --> 03:59:57,180
With Beautiful Junior Comedian...

4834
03:59:14,480 --> 03:59:20,740
Well, I heard that he had some trouble with *** from ***.

4835
03:59:22,240 --> 03:59:24,210
I heard they were quite drunk.

4836
03:59:25,140 --> 03:59:28,010
Let me explain what happened.

4837
03:59:28,010 --> 03:59:31,610
Mimata Matazo is a quite dangerous man.

4838
03:59:31,610 --> 03:59:34,210
He used to own a bar in Roppongi.

4839
03:59:34,210 --> 03:59:38,880
And when I, my girlfriend, and two junior comedians, four of us went there,

4840
03:59:38,880 --> 03:59:40,240
Yes.

4841
03:59:40,240 --> 03:59:42,480
He was there by himself.  Mimata Matazo-san.

4842
03:59:42,480 --> 03:59:44,480
He welcomed us.

4843
03:59:44,480 --> 03:59:45,980
And invited us to drink together.

4844
03:59:45,980 --> 03:59:48,480
So we were about to drink.

4845
03:59:48,480 --> 03:59:49,280
Then...

4846
03:59:49,940 --> 03:59:53,840
The beautiful ***M arrived.

4847
03:59:53,840 --> 03:59:57,280
Compared to Takahashi, she was still a newbie.

4848
03:59:57,180 --> 04:00:30,640
Mimata Matazo's Secret

4849
03:59:57,180 --> 04:00:30,640
With Beautiful Junior Comedian...

4850
03:59:59,010 --> 04:00:00,340
"Are you drinking?"

4851
04:00:01,040 --> 04:00:02,610
"Let me join!"

4852
04:00:03,140 --> 04:00:05,540
She was so friendly since she was drunk.

4853
04:00:05,540 --> 04:00:08,880
Under normal circumstances,

4854
04:00:08,880 --> 04:00:12,780
I think Mimata, the master of the bar, should have scolded her.

4855
04:00:13,040 --> 04:00:15,440
Because Takahashi is her senior and she should show him respect.

4856
04:00:14,780 --> 04:00:15,280
Yeah.

4857
04:00:15,740 --> 04:00:17,240
"Never mind that, ***."

4858
04:00:18,810 --> 04:00:22,280
"Just sit next to me, and be quiet."

4859
04:00:24,340 --> 04:00:25,680
That's strange.

4860
04:00:26,040 --> 04:00:28,540
"Let's go to *** like the last time."

4861
04:00:36,780 --> 04:00:37,880
Are you serious?

4862
04:00:38,880 --> 04:00:39,780
Hey!

4863
04:00:43,880 --> 04:00:55,240
Mimata Matazo's Secret

4864
04:00:43,880 --> 04:00:55,240
With Beautiful Newbie Comedian...

4865
04:00:44,640 --> 04:00:48,810
I didn't want to be bothered, so I said " I'm leaving." Then when I was going to pay for the bill,

4866
04:00:49,010 --> 04:00:51,180
I only had a glass.

4867
04:00:51,240 --> 04:00:53,040
"Oh, Takahashi. Please come again."

4868
04:00:53,240 --> 04:00:55,740
"Your bill comes to 18,000 yen."

4869
04:01:04,280 --> 04:01:08,040
He was trying to show off to ***.

4870
04:01:10,910 --> 04:01:14,040
In fact, this story still continues.

4871
04:01:11,180 --> 04:01:12,410
That's dangerous.

4872
04:01:14,240 --> 04:01:38,440
Mimata Matazo's Secret

4873
04:01:14,240 --> 04:01:38,440
With Beautiful Newbie Comedian...

4874
04:01:14,310 --> 04:01:16,710
I got a call from ***, and she said

4875
04:01:16,710 --> 04:01:19,480
on that night that she got drunk,

4876
04:01:19,680 --> 04:01:23,740
Mimata said that he would take her home.

4877
04:01:24,140 --> 04:01:25,710
She said he didn't have to do it, but

4878
04:01:26,140 --> 04:01:27,440
he said nothing was going to happen

4879
04:01:27,580 --> 04:01:32,810
between us because we are comedians. So, he took her home.

4880
04:01:32,810 --> 04:01:34,610
From that point on, she doesn't remember anything, but

4881
04:01:34,610 --> 04:01:35,810
when she got up in the morning,

4882
04:01:36,110 --> 04:01:38,880
her skirt was removed.

4883
04:01:55,840 --> 04:01:58,140
It's not a laughing matter!

4884
04:02:00,580 --> 04:02:15,180
Mimata Matazo's Secret

4885
04:02:00,580 --> 04:02:15,180
With Beautiful Newbie Comedian...

4886
04:02:01,740 --> 04:02:03,910
It was just off,

4887
04:02:03,980 --> 04:02:07,740
he said he didn't do anything, he just took it off because she looked sick.

4888
04:02:07,740 --> 04:02:10,840
Even though he says nothing happened,

4889
04:02:10,840 --> 04:02:13,540
since that day, he calls her "***."

4890
04:02:19,980 --> 04:02:20,980
Help me!

4891
04:02:21,840 --> 04:02:23,110
Help me!

4892
04:02:26,740 --> 04:02:29,040
Something like that could get him arrested right?

4893
04:02:30,580 --> 04:02:32,740
No wonder the shop closed.

4894
04:02:32,940 --> 04:02:34,940
There are no rules here?

4895
04:02:37,340 --> 04:02:39,110
What is this?

4896
04:02:41,340 --> 04:02:42,510
Continue please!

4897
04:02:42,510 --> 04:02:43,310
Please go ahead.

4898
04:02:43,740 --> 04:02:45,380
Something easy.

4899
04:02:45,480 --> 04:02:47,610
I heard this from Kojima, UN-JASH.

4900
04:02:47,580 --> 04:02:57,480
Kojima Kazuya
(UN-JASH)

4901
04:02:47,580 --> 04:02:57,480
Provided by

4902
04:02:47,640 --> 04:02:52,240
About his partner, Watabe.

4903
04:02:52,010 --> 04:03:01,380
At Drink Party...

4904
04:02:52,010 --> 04:03:01,380
Watabe Ken's Secret

4905
04:02:52,240 --> 04:02:56,010
This is something easy, lately every time he drinks,

4906
04:02:56,410 --> 04:02:57,080
he complains.

4907
04:02:57,880 --> 04:02:58,910
His complaint is,

4908
04:02:59,140 --> 04:03:01,240
that *** salary is so low.

4909
04:03:08,740 --> 04:03:11,180
That's easy. We need more of these.

4910
04:03:12,040 --> 04:03:13,610
He won't be on the black list.

4911
04:03:15,610 --> 04:03:18,210
Did you learn a lot?  We're going now.

4912
04:03:18,210 --> 04:03:22,540
Did we learn...?  We heard terrible stories.

4913
04:03:23,140 --> 04:03:23,780
It was something.

4914
04:03:24,340 --> 04:03:25,340
Yeah, it was.

4915
04:03:26,280 --> 04:03:28,540
Now I remember I heard it (Mimata's story) before.

4916
04:03:29,240 --> 04:03:31,440
It was too lame to remember.

4917
04:03:38,640 --> 04:03:40,440
Meeting is finished.

4918
04:03:40,510 --> 04:03:42,440
Looks like more have been bitten.

4919
04:03:42,310 --> 04:03:47,680
One Zombie After Another

4920
04:03:42,310 --> 04:03:47,680
Zombie Chad

4921
04:03:42,310 --> 04:03:47,680
Zombie Itao

4922
04:03:42,480 --> 04:03:43,840
Looks like more zombies.

4923
04:03:48,680 --> 04:03:50,140
What the hell are they doing?

4924
04:03:50,040 --> 04:03:51,940
My dad has been bitten too!

4925
04:03:52,640 --> 04:03:58,740
Zombie Dad Appears

4926
04:03:53,440 --> 04:03:55,110
What is he doing?

4927
04:03:58,910 --> 04:04:00,140
My dad became a Zombie.

4928
04:04:01,340 --> 04:04:03,210
Chad also?

4929
04:04:05,140 --> 04:04:07,380
My dad got bitten.

4930
04:04:07,580 --> 04:04:09,480
Your dad is a good actor.

4931
04:04:11,010 --> 04:04:15,740
What should I feel as his son...

4932
04:04:18,480 --> 04:04:20,040
It's been 15 hours since the start.

4933
04:04:20,480 --> 04:04:21,940
It's a new day.

4934
04:04:22,740 --> 04:04:26,140
These men have been through hard duties.

4935
04:04:27,510 --> 04:04:28,940
No words,

4936
04:04:29,840 --> 04:04:31,810
they are just staring into space.

4937
04:04:32,640 --> 04:04:35,180
All we can see on their faces is tiredness.

4938
04:04:39,040 --> 04:04:41,940
You often do that, huh.  Quit it really.

4939
04:04:42,980 --> 04:04:44,210
Nobody gains.

4940
04:04:44,840 --> 04:04:45,540
Alright?

4941
04:04:46,080 --> 04:04:50,180

1 year anniversary?

4947
04:05:00,510 --> 04:05:02,110

4955
04:05:31,210 --> 04:05:32,110
Easy lines.

4956
04:05:32,110 --> 04:05:32,580
Yeah.

4957
04:05:34,980 --> 04:05:39,410
1 Year Anniversary Ceremony Of The Opening Of The Airport

4958
04:05:39,440 --> 04:05:42,280
First of all, the big-shot politician.

4959
04:05:42,280 --> 04:05:47,540
The former Prime Minister, Kan Naoto came to address everyone.

4960
04:05:50,810 --> 04:05:54,410
Kan Naoto (Teru)

4961
04:05:50,810 --> 04:05:54,410
The Former Prime Minister

4962
04:06:02,240 --> 04:06:04,180
Too realistic.

4963
04:06:04,210 --> 04:06:05,540
Awesome.

4964
04:06:05,540 --> 04:06:07,710
He looks too realistic.

4965
04:06:11,240 --> 04:06:13,140
He looks exactly like him.

4966
04:06:14,040 --> 04:06:16,440
I'm Kan Naoto.

4967
04:06:16,440 --> 04:06:19,610
I was the Prime Minister until recently.

4968
04:06:20,110 --> 04:06:22,580
Now, I am just an old man that likes to go on a pilgrimage.

4969
04:06:22,580 --> 04:06:23,380
Haha.

4970
04:06:24,340 --> 04:06:29,010
Now that saving power is really important,

4971
04:06:29,010 --> 04:06:31,810
so I carry something like this with me.

4972

Hey! You guys.

4979
04:06:56,380 --> 04:06:58,480
You guys, be quiet. Hey!

4980
04:06:58,710 --> 04:07:01,340

Shall we have you guys do something to kill time?

4990
04:07:21,580 --> 04:07:25,640

No idea.

I am

5037

the wife of a King, a Queen.

5038
04:09:22,080 --> 04:09:23,910
He should know that's wrong.

5039

Oh ouch!

The same to you!

5052
04:09:55,640 --> 04:09:57,640
It's because you tried hard!

5053
04:10:01,680 --> 04:10:04,180
When can he talk normally?

5054
04:10:04,440 --> 04:10:07,180
This is supposed to be a serious moment.

5055
04:10:11,440 --> 04:10:13,840
Instructor, I'll keep trying.

5056
04:10:12,880 --> 04:10:13,810
Good luck.

5057
04:10:13,840 --> 04:10:16,580
What the hell are you guys talking about?

5058
04:10:16,580 --> 04:10:17,810
I'm going to kill you!

5059

Chiemi

5062
04:10:24,010 --> 04:10:24,910
Why did this happen?

5063
04:10:25,140 --> 04:10:26,710
Chiemi

5064
04:10:25,840 --> 04:10:26,710

5065
04:10:26,710 --> 04:10:28,110
Why did this happen?

5066
04:10:32,280 --> 04:10:33,710
Chiemi!

5067
04:10:34,210 --> 04:10:35,110

04:10:50,580 --> 04:10:51,840
Chiemi.  Are you OK, Chiemi?

5071
04:10:50,880 --> 04:10:55,440
CA Died In Place of Instructor

5072
04:10:51,980 --> 04:10:53,140
Chiemi, are you OK?

5073
04:10:53,580 --> 04:10:55,380
Why did this happen?

5074
04:10:58,110 --> 04:11:02,110
Suddenly The Terrorist Gets Shot

5075
04:10:58,710 --> 04:10:59,180
Huh?

5076
04:11:00,080 --> 04:11:01,080
Here!?

5077
04:11:02,910 --> 04:11:04,910
That's SAT.

5078
04:11:04,910 --> 04:11:10,910
SAT Appears

5079
04:11:06,840 --> 04:11:08,310
We're safe now.

5080
04:11:09,140 --> 04:11:09,880
Good.

5081
04:11:11,410 --> 04:11:14,140
GOD

5082
04:11:11,680 --> 04:11:14,140
DAMN!

5083
04:11:14,440 --> 04:11:16,540
Chono Masahiro Barges In

5084
04:11:18,380 --> 04:11:19,640
Here he comes

5085
04:11:19,840 --> 04:11:21,010
What's going on?

5086
04:11:24,240 --> 04:11:25,710
This is terrible!

5087
04:11:29,280 --> 04:11:35,080
Captain Chono Finds Something

5088
04:11:30,210 --> 04:11:31,110
What?

5089
04:11:33,580 --> 04:11:36,080
No wonder you made that face.
- Yeah.

5090
04:11:38,510 --> 04:11:42,210
This is a dying message.

5091
04:11:42,780 --> 04:11:43,510
Transport her.

5092
04:11:46,740 --> 04:11:47,640
Be careful!

5093
04:11:47,640 --> 04:11:48,110
Yes sir.

5094
04:11:55,180 --> 04:11:59,440

ZA

5098
04:12:04,710 --> 04:12:08,380
It's a message that the CA left right before she died,

5099
04:12:09,080 --> 04:12:10,910
even though it is not completed.

5100
04:12:11,910 --> 04:12:17,580
A terrorist sympathizer's name is written.

5101
04:12:18,640 --> 04:12:19,340
Hey!

5102
04:12:20,840 --> 04:12:27,710
Is there anyone here named YAMAZA?

5103
04:12:27,710 --> 04:12:31,580
Be honest and get up here!

5104
04:12:34,540 --> 04:12:35,380
I see.

5105
04:12:36,480 --> 04:12:38,880
Are you trying to hide?

5106
04:12:39,940 --> 04:12:44,080
It's gotta be one of you.

5107
04:12:45,110 --> 04:12:50,380
You can't hide.  It's written on your face.

5108
04:12:50,380 --> 04:12:54,940
It's Yamaza!

5109
04:12:51,710 --> 04:12:54,940
Does anyone have any idea?

5110
04:12:55,080 --> 04:12:56,280
I'll ask one by one.

5111
04:12:56,640 --> 04:13:00,340
Searching For The Person With The Name, "Yamaza"

5112
04:12:58,040 --> 04:12:58,680

5121
04:13:15,610 --> 04:13:17,010

5127
04:13:26,940 --> 04:13:29,610
Aren't you lying?

5128
04:13:29,180 --> 04:13:29,780
No.

5129
04:13:31,910 --> 04:13:32,840

What's your name?

5139
04:14:08,010 --> 04:14:10,280
I'm asking for your name damn you!

04:14:15,080 --> 04:14:20,010
Imasaki Hosei.

5141
04:14:23,440 --> 04:14:24,810
The worst.

5142
04:14:26,780 --> 04:14:28,440
You're the worst.

5143
04:14:29,110 --> 04:14:31,680
You probably shouldn't lie.

5144
04:14:32,010 --> 04:14:34,580
I can't stand it.

5145
04:14:34,880 --> 04:14:36,140
Just say it.

5146
04:14:38,380 --> 04:14:39,240
That's interesting.

5147
04:14:40,610 --> 04:14:42,580
Can you tell me your name again?

5148
04:14:42,580 --> 04:14:44,980
Imasaki.

5149
04:14:44,980 --> 04:14:49,940
I'm Imasaki Jose.

5150
04:14:50,710 --> 04:14:52,340
Your given name doesn't matter!

5151
04:14:53,340 --> 04:14:55,010
Give me a break!

5152
04:14:56,510 --> 04:14:58,780
What's the hell is "Jose"

5153
04:15:01,110 --> 04:15:03,080
Come on, please.

5154
04:15:03,880 --> 04:15:06,340
It can't be helped.

5155
04:15:07,910 --> 04:15:09,980
Say your name properly to your friends.

5156
04:15:09,980 --> 04:15:12,180
Stand up, face them and say it properly.

5157
04:15:12,310 --> 04:15:15,710
Say your name properly.

5158
04:15:17,180 --> 04:15:19,310
Say it. What's your name?

5159
04:15:19,510 --> 04:15:21,980
Imasaki Jose.

5160
04:15:31,080 --> 04:15:33,310
A long way to go!

5161
04:15:37,540 --> 04:15:39,680
You guys know him, don't you?

5162
04:15:39,840 --> 04:15:43,410
His name is Yamazaki Housei.

5163
04:15:42,280 --> 04:15:43,410
Are you Yamazaki?

5164
04:15:43,410 --> 04:15:46,380
But it's actually Yamasaki.

5165
04:15:47,440 --> 04:15:48,910
You're suspicious.  Come here.

5166
04:15:49,940 --> 04:15:55,480
Sanction Slap for the Terrorist's Sympathizer

5167
04:15:53,180 --> 04:15:54,840
Don't you feel anything?

5168
04:15:55,480 --> 04:15:58,780
This happened because you gave information to terrorists!

5169
04:15:58,910 --> 04:16:00,910
I didn't do it.

5170
04:16:09,240 --> 04:16:11,410
I couldn't stand the silence.

5171
04:16:18,710 --> 04:16:20,240
There is no way to get away. Come closer.

5172
04:16:21,540 --> 04:16:23,380
Wait

5173
04:16:21,680 --> 04:16:23,380
wait

5174
04:16:21,840 --> 04:16:23,380
wait

5175
04:16:23,380 --> 04:16:25,710
So why was your name written?

5176
04:16:26,380 --> 04:16:27,980
I have no idea, really.

5177
04:16:27,980 --> 04:16:29,380
Confess!

5178
04:16:29,380 --> 04:16:31,010
Confess what?

5179
04:16:31,310 --> 04:16:33,880
Try rolling this on your neck.

5180
04:16:34,340 --> 04:16:35,310
You'll understand the feeling.

5181
04:16:39,510 --> 04:16:41,180
Understood?

5182
04:16:48,480 --> 04:16:51,710
Understand the feeling of what?

5183
04:16:48,780 --> 04:16:49,840
Stand up!

5184
04:16:50,640 --> 04:16:51,840
Stand up!

5185
04:16:53,310 --> 04:16:55,240
Understand what...

5186
04:16:55,480 --> 04:16:57,940
This time he is getting a neck punishment.

5187
04:16:55,910 --> 04:16:57,140
Stand up!

5188
04:16:57,540 --> 04:16:59,140
Understood?

5189
04:16:59,540 --> 04:17:02,580
I'll give you a chance!

5190
04:17:02,580 --> 04:17:03,540
Give me a chance!

5191
04:17:03,540 --> 04:17:05,410
No, I lied.

5192
04:17:06,840 --> 04:17:07,780
Wait huh!

5193
04:17:08,210 --> 04:17:09,310
Nooo!

5194
04:17:09,310 --> 04:17:10,580
Noooo!

5195
04:17:11,310 --> 04:17:13,540
Give me a chance, please.

5196
04:17:13,540 --> 04:17:15,580
Do something then.

5197
04:17:15,580 --> 04:17:18,840
Something that you like.

5198
04:17:17,940 --> 04:17:18,840
What I like?

5199
04:17:18,840 --> 04:17:19,840
Something you are good at.

5200
04:17:20,140 --> 04:17:22,180
A loud voice!

5201
04:17:21,380 --> 04:17:22,340
Do it then.

5202
04:17:29,010 --> 04:17:30,380
What is that.

5203
04:17:32,610 --> 04:17:34,880
What's with this guy.

5204
04:17:36,640 --> 04:17:37,340
What.

5205
04:17:40,380 --> 04:17:43,680
Come on, this again!

5206
04:17:43,910 --> 04:17:45,710
What did you say first?

5207
04:17:45,710 --> 04:17:47,210
Your name? Say it again!

5208
04:17:48,040 --> 04:17:50,780
What's your name?

5209
04:17:51,340 --> 04:17:56,280
Well.. how.. nothing can save me now right?

5210
04:17:56,280 --> 04:17:57,640
Nothing can save me now right?

5211
04:17:58,080 --> 04:18:00,180
Chono-san, do you want to

5212
04:17:58,080 --> 04:18:00,180
SLAP?

5213
04:18:03,210 --> 04:18:04,910
SLAP

5214
04:18:03,210 --> 04:18:04,910
You want to                    , right?

5215
04:18:08,610 --> 04:18:11,410
Maybe you shouldn't call him "Chono-san" now?

5216
04:18:14,410 --> 04:18:16,280
SLAP

5217
04:18:14,410 --> 04:18:16,280
You want to                    , right?                           .

5218
04:18:15,610 --> 04:18:16,310
SLAP

5219
04:18:16,340 --> 04:18:17,940
It doesn't have to be me?

5220
04:18:17,940 --> 04:18:19,480
That's all I want to know.

5221
04:18:20,310 --> 04:18:21,540
Cant it be him?

5222
04:18:21,540 --> 04:18:22,510
Him

5223
04:18:21,840 --> 04:18:22,510
HIM

5224
04:18:22,040 --> 04:18:22,510
HIM!

5225
04:18:23,180 --> 04:18:24,580
Hey! Endo

5226
04:18:24,580 --> 04:18:25,710
YOU!

5227
04:18:25,710 --> 04:18:28,140
What you!  Why are you trying to get away!

5228
04:18:30,140 --> 04:18:32,510
Tanaka please take my place.

5229
04:18:32,510 --> 04:18:35,380
I'll do whatever you ask from now on.

5230
04:18:35,380 --> 04:18:37,910
Tell me who can take your place!

5231
04:18:38,340 --> 04:18:40,940
Ask them then.

5232
04:18:38,380 --> 04:18:39,980
Please.

5233
04:18:40,940 --> 04:18:43,780
Please.

5234
04:18:44,010 --> 04:18:47,180
I'm sorry but I can't.

5235
04:18:48,080 --> 04:18:49,880
I can't.

5236
04:18:50,910 --> 04:18:52,440
I can't.

5237
04:18:52,440 --> 04:18:54,040
Tanaka take him back.

5238
04:18:54,640 --> 04:18:57,110
It can't be helped.

5239
04:18:59,480 --> 04:19:01,040
Please wait.  Yes I will.

5240
04:19:01,810 --> 04:19:04,910
Hurry up and make your last appeal!

5241
04:19:05,680 --> 04:19:06,510
Tanaka.

5242
04:19:06,940 --> 04:19:09,280
I really hate this.

5243
04:19:09,280 --> 04:19:12,040
If you can take my place,

5244
04:19:12,040 --> 04:19:14,480
I will definitely be your good friend!

5245
04:19:26,840 --> 04:19:29,010
Come on.

5246
04:19:29,010 --> 04:19:29,740
Done?

5247
04:19:29,740 --> 04:19:31,440
Yama-chan, please.

5248
04:19:31,440 --> 04:19:32,480
Come here.  Hurry up.

5249
04:19:32,480 --> 04:19:34,080
The hits are getting stronger.

5250
04:19:34,480 --> 04:19:36,710
No need for formalities.

5251
04:19:49,580 --> 04:19:51,280
We already know each other.

5252
04:19:51,380 --> 04:19:53,510
What's the matter?

5253
04:19:53,840 --> 04:19:55,380
Do you want to get closer to me?

5254
04:20:05,710 --> 04:20:07,040
You were laughing.

5255
04:20:13,680 --> 04:20:15,180
Hey stand up!

5256
04:20:15,180 --> 04:20:16,580
I'm falling, falling.

5257
04:20:17,340 --> 04:20:18,610
That's enough.  That's enough.

5258
04:20:19,340 --> 04:20:21,280
Every year,

5259
04:20:20,840 --> 04:20:22,110
Step

5260
04:20:22,280 --> 04:20:24,380
Please don't step on my foot!

5261
04:20:24,510 --> 04:20:25,810
Ouch!

5262
04:20:41,580 --> 04:20:42,780
Ouch!

5263
04:20:42,780 --> 04:20:44,240
Hurry and stand up!

5264
04:20:44,440 --> 04:20:45,610
OK, stand up.

5265
04:20:45,610 --> 04:20:47,410
Here we go!

5266
04:20:47,410 --> 04:20:49,910
Stand up, stay still!

5267
04:20:47,940 --> 04:20:48,740
Be strong.

5268
04:20:50,010 --> 04:20:52,480
Let me hear your name again, OK?

5269
04:20:52,480 --> 04:20:56,880
Then say "I'm sorry."

5270
04:20:57,710 --> 04:20:59,840
What is it! Say it properly.

5271
04:21:00,340 --> 04:21:04,580
Yama...

5272
04:21:04,580 --> 04:21:06,710
Yamazaki

5273
04:21:09,310 --> 04:21:10,240
Housei!

5274
04:21:29,980 --> 04:21:30,940
God Damn.

5275
04:21:31,610 --> 04:21:34,240
Hey let's go!

5276
04:21:36,110 --> 04:21:37,610
It was a mess.

5277
04:21:41,510 --> 04:21:43,610
Let's go.

5278
04:21:45,580 --> 04:21:49,240
I'm done.

5279
04:22:01,280 --> 04:22:03,610
Shall we go?

5280
04:22:13,840 --> 04:22:20,840
1:00 am, after completing their duties at the airport, they are heading back to the school.

5281
04:22:18,710 --> 04:22:23,880
Return To The Training School

5282
04:22:28,140 --> 04:22:28,780
So cold.

5283
04:22:29,040 --> 04:22:32,710
Then after this, something unsuspected happens.

5284
04:22:33,840 --> 04:22:35,380
My butt hurts.

5285
04:22:35,380 --> 04:22:36,380
Are we entering?

5286
04:22:36,380 --> 04:22:36,980
Inside?

5287
04:22:47,880 --> 04:22:49,410
Zombies!

5288
04:22:51,880 --> 04:22:55,610
A Hoard of Zombies Attacks

5289
04:23:01,210 --> 04:23:04,380
Let's get out!

5290
04:23:02,240 --> 04:23:04,380
Everyone, let's get out!

5291
04:23:04,380 --> 04:23:06,080
I have a fracture!

5292
04:23:07,910 --> 04:23:09,780
I said I have a fracture!

5293
04:23:11,240 --> 04:23:12,940
Close the door!

5294
04:23:16,440 --> 04:23:19,280
Zombie Itao

5295
04:23:20,510 --> 04:23:21,710
Wow, it scares me!

5296
04:23:26,880 --> 04:23:31,540
Zombie Dad

5297
04:23:30,140 --> 04:23:31,210
It's your dad.

5298
04:23:32,540 --> 04:23:34,410
What are you doing there?

5299
04:23:40,380 --> 04:23:43,710
All of a sudden a crowd of Zombies attacked the members.

5300
04:23:44,740 --> 04:23:47,640
They could get out of the airport safely. However...

5301
04:23:49,110 --> 04:23:51,240
It was dangerous.

5302
04:23:53,610 --> 04:23:57,310
I said I have a fracture!

5303
04:23:57,380 --> 04:23:58,640
Yes, you did.

5304
04:24:00,640 --> 04:24:02,980
They made him run.

5305
04:24:03,410 --> 04:24:05,340
They made him run pretty hard.

5306
04:24:07,710 --> 04:24:11,610
Bus Driver Is Also Zombie

5307
04:24:10,580 --> 04:24:12,440
We didn't know about this.
- Yeah.

5308
04:24:17,640 --> 04:24:19,110
2:00 am,

5309
04:24:19,480 --> 04:24:21,310
they arrive at the training school.

5310
04:24:22,540 --> 04:24:25,840
The five members were just released from their hard duties in the airport.

5311
04:24:26,240 --> 04:24:28,110
However, more trials are waiting for them.

5312
04:24:30,180 --> 04:24:32,240
It's an emergency!

5313
04:24:32,240 --> 04:24:36,380
One of our instructors has been kidnapped by a group of hoodlums.

5314
04:24:36,380 --> 04:24:38,380
They should still be around here.

5315
04:24:38,740 --> 04:24:42,410
Yamazaki and Endo, can you go find them?

5316
04:24:41,940 --> 04:24:42,910
What is it?

5317
04:24:44,510 --> 04:24:45,610
Where?

5318
04:24:45,780 --> 04:24:46,810
I forgot to tell you.

5319
04:24:47,310 --> 04:24:51,880
From now on, it's not "No-laughing" but "No-getting scared"

5320
04:24:52,780 --> 04:24:54,580
Middle of the night special rule

5321
04:24:54,840 --> 04:24:58,240
No Getting Scared Airport.

5322
04:24:59,380 --> 04:25:02,240
So what's with you guys, Slightly Sweet.

5323
04:25:02,240 --> 04:25:05,640
You know what, we are great. We've been increasing popularity.

5324
04:25:05,640 --> 04:25:08,080
Well, I can see you trying hard.

5325
04:25:08,180 --> 04:25:11,580
Doing great when some people prefer black or cafe au latte.

5326
04:25:11,580 --> 04:25:14,580
Even though we belong to different groups, our goal is the same.

5327
04:25:14,880 --> 04:25:16,010
Here you go.

5328
04:25:16,240 --> 04:25:18,780
Not that. This is mine.

5329
04:25:19,440 --> 04:25:24,710
What? You don't make sense. Do you understand which group you are in?

5330
04:25:24,710 --> 04:25:27,880
Of course I do.  I notice it every time I see my outfit.

5331
04:25:27,880 --> 04:25:29,510
That's not good.

5332
04:25:29,510 --> 04:25:33,080
Some vending machines don't have mine.

5333
04:25:34,240 --> 04:25:35,910
It really surprised me.

5334
04:25:35,910 --> 04:25:37,910
Of course it's sold out.

5335
04:25:38,740 --> 04:25:39,940
Anyway...

5336
04:25:41,310 --> 04:25:43,140
Cheers!

5337
04:25:41,310 --> 04:25:43,140
Cheers!

5338
04:25:45,440 --> 04:25:46,140
This is good.

5339
04:25:46,140 --> 04:25:48,410
I am really into slightly sweet.

5340
04:25:48,410 --> 04:25:49,340
I really like Ememan.

5341
04:25:53,540 --> 04:25:54,340
Let's go then.

5342
04:25:54,340 --> 04:25:55,410
Shall we go then?

5343
04:25:55,040 --> 04:25:55,410
Yes.

5344
04:25:56,580 --> 04:25:58,780
Don't miss the opening of 2012!!

5345
04:26:00,310 --> 04:26:02,080
Middle of the night special rule,

5346
04:26:02,440 --> 04:26:05,640
No Getting Scared Airport.

5347
04:26:07,240 --> 04:26:08,980
Firstly, Yamazaki and Endo are

5348
04:26:09,540 --> 04:26:12,280
heading to the changing room on the 2nd floor,

5349
04:26:12,510 --> 04:26:15,040
where the kidnapped instructor was seen for the last time.

5350
04:26:15,040 --> 04:26:16,880
Isn't it No Laughing?

5351
04:26:16,040 --> 04:26:17,840
We're leaving.

5352
04:26:17,110 --> 04:26:17,840
We're leaving.

5353
04:26:17,840 --> 04:26:20,140
Supposedly he was seen in the changing room on the 2nd floor.

5354
04:26:22,240 --> 04:26:25,840
It's the pattern of 2 pairs...

5355
04:26:24,210 --> 04:26:31,240
Lighting Changed

5356
04:26:28,840 --> 04:26:29,810
Wait a second, this is...

5357
04:26:29,810 --> 04:26:30,880
Let's go slowly.

5358
04:26:32,480 --> 04:26:36,810
CO2 Gas

5359
04:26:32,480 --> 04:26:36,810
In           Seconds

5360
04:26:34,580 --> 04:26:36,240
We have to follow the arrow, right?

5361
04:26:41,540 --> 04:26:44,680
From here, Getting Scared Word Link Game starts...?

5362
04:26:42,710 --> 04:26:46,610
Getting Scared Word Link Game Starts

5363
04:26:48,910 --> 04:26:50,810
Ringo (apple)

5364
04:26:50,810 --> 04:26:54,010
It's No Getting Scared Word Link Game!

5365
04:26:53,240 --> 04:26:53,840
What?

5366
04:26:54,380 --> 04:27:01,780
Rin"Go"

5367
04:26:58,780 --> 04:26:59,840
Ringo.

5368
04:27:00,540 --> 04:27:02,240
Gorira

5369
04:27:02,240 --> 04:27:12,240
Gorii"Ra"

5370
04:27:02,240 --> 04:27:12,240

5371
04:27:10,380 --> 04:27:15,010
In              Seconds

5372
04:27:10,380 --> 04:27:15,010
Secret Trap Starts

5373
04:27:12,710 --> 04:27:15,010
Gori"Ra"

5374
04:27:12,710 --> 04:27:15,010
Rap "Pa"

5375
04:27:12,710 --> 04:27:15,010
Rin"Go"

5376
04:27:15,010 --> 04:27:16,840
Pa pa pa...

5377
04:27:15,010 --> 04:27:16,840
Pa pa pa...

5378
04:27:16,140 --> 04:27:17,310
Panaki!

5379
04:27:17,640 --> 04:27:19,080
Panaki!

5380
04:27:19,080 --> 04:27:20,710
Panaki!

5381
04:27:20,710 --> 04:27:25,380
Savanna Yagi 's "Panaki"

5382
04:27:20,810 --> 04:27:22,210
What is it!

5383
04:27:21,740 --> 04:27:22,810
Panaki!

5384
04:27:26,580 --> 04:27:28,540
Getting Scared Word Link Game Ends

5385
04:27:29,080 --> 04:27:31,880
At the same time in the training room...

5386
04:27:33,880 --> 04:27:35,740
Shall I give you a ride?

5387
04:27:46,610 --> 04:27:49,240
Oops. Dangerous.

5388
04:27:49,740 --> 04:27:50,940
When was it?

5389
04:27:51,580 --> 04:27:53,610
They were doing this?

5390
04:27:59,010 --> 04:28:00,610
You must've had no idea what to do.

5391
04:28:00,610 --> 04:28:02,280
I really didn't know.

5392
04:28:05,210 --> 04:28:08,240
What are you doing?

5393
04:28:08,240 --> 04:28:10,510
For argument's sake, I am OK.

5394
04:28:11,040 --> 04:28:13,580
But I feel sorry for Tanaka.

5395
04:28:14,080 --> 04:28:17,440
Tanaka has no idea what to do.

5396
04:28:17,440 --> 04:28:23,010
Nakata Kausu・Botan

5397
04:28:18,380 --> 04:28:23,010
If Kausu・Botan-san started doing this, I wouldn't know what to do.

5398
04:28:23,810 --> 04:28:25,340
Meanwhile, Yamazaki and Endo...

5399
04:28:26,440 --> 04:28:30,780
Mysterious Masked Group

5400
04:28:26,640 --> 04:28:29,480
were attacked by a mysterious masked group.

5401

2F Storage Room

5402
04:28:35,080 --> 04:28:35,740
I'm scared!

5403
04:28:35,740 --> 04:28:37,010
Ouch!  Ouch!  Ouch!

5404
04:28:36,340 --> 04:28:43,840
Handcuffed And Confined In The Storage Room

5405
04:28:42,110 --> 04:28:43,210
What the hell?

5406
04:28:44,510 --> 04:28:45,840
What's going on?

5407
04:28:45,140 --> 04:28:49,710
Getting Scared Theater Opens

5408
04:28:47,240 --> 04:28:48,740
Getting Scared Theater!

5409
04:28:49,440 --> 04:28:51,240
Getting Scared Theater...

5410
04:28:51,140 --> 04:28:54,110
Hissatsu Shigotonin

5411
04:28:51,910 --> 04:28:53,780
Did you watch this?
-Yes.

5412
04:28:57,210 --> 04:28:59,510
Hissatsu Shigotonin

5413
04:28:59,510 --> 04:29:01,980
The 2 guest will be at risk!

5414
04:29:01,980 --> 04:29:03,380
I'm scared!  I'm scared!

5415
04:29:02,380 --> 04:29:06,010
In             Seconds

04:29:02,380 --> 04:29:06,010
Secret Trap Starts

5417
04:29:03,680 --> 04:29:06,210
Weird atmosphere
-Super scary.

5418
04:29:11,480 --> 04:29:16,680
Hi, this is Kyomoto Masaki, Hissatsu Shigotonin.

5419
04:29:16,680 --> 04:29:24,580
Kyomoto Masaki's Incomplete Imitation (Razah Ramon RG)

5420
04:29:17,710 --> 04:29:24,740
Let me sing the Historical Play Aruaru in the melody of Nonstop Romantic by C-C-B.

5421
04:29:25,140 --> 04:29:29,980
Historical Play Aruaru

5422
04:29:25,140 --> 04:29:29,980

5424
04:29:36,010 --> 04:29:41,610
I want to tell you things that happen in historical plays

5425
04:29:41,810 --> 04:29:46,440
Things that happen in historical plays

5426
04:29:46,680 --> 04:29:49,080
I want to tell you

5427
04:29:49,680 --> 04:29:53,640
I want to tell you things that happen in historical plays

5428
04:29:54,280 --> 04:29:57,140
High heel, high heel, high heel, high heel

5429
04:29:57,610 --> 04:30:03,380
Historical play, many things, I want to say it

5430
04:29:58,510 --> 04:30:00,840
Hurry up and finish it

5431
04:30:02,980 --> 04:30:05,140
Just finish it already

5432
04:30:03,480 --> 04:30:09,210
I want to say it I want to say it, it becomes painful it becomes painful

5433
04:30:09,410 --> 04:30:13,410
Historical play, I have a lot to say, as soon as possible

5434
04:30:14,010 --> 04:30:18,140
Historical play, a lot, the end roll is

5435
04:30:15,180 --> 04:30:19,180
Prank in

5436
04:30:18,180 --> 04:30:19,980
All vertical writing

5437
04:30:21,840 --> 04:30:26,080
CO2 Gas Shoots Out

5438
04:30:26,710 --> 04:30:28,080
What is that?

5439
04:30:28,610 --> 04:30:30,540
Eventually it ended like this.

5440
04:30:30,280 --> 04:30:30,980
Hey!

5441
04:30:31,480 --> 04:30:33,880
What are you doing, hey!

5442
04:30:34,340 --> 04:30:38,610
Bomb

5443
04:30:36,940 --> 04:30:38,540
We really can't get out of this thing you know!

5444
04:30:38,610 --> 04:30:39,240
Stop!

5445
04:30:39,240 --> 04:30:41,080
Stop it!  What is this?!

5446
04:30:41,840 --> 04:30:47,010
The RG Lights The Fuse

5447
04:30:45,180 --> 04:30:46,080
I'm scared!

5448
04:30:47,740 --> 04:30:49,010
Hey, what's gonna happen!?

5449
04:30:48,040 --> 04:30:52,540
Explosion in

5450
04:30:56,380 --> 04:31:00,680
Flowers From The Bomb

5451
04:31:00,810 --> 04:31:03,540
I feel so drained

5452
04:31:03,540 --> 04:31:04,440
Huh?

5453
04:31:04,440 --> 04:31:11,640
Their Mouths Are Gagged

5454
04:31:12,410 --> 04:31:13,540
Huh?

5455
04:31:15,840 --> 04:31:17,580
This is bad!

5456
04:31:17,580 --> 04:31:20,740
Yamazaki and Endo got kidnap... I mean got attacked.

5457
04:31:20,740 --> 04:31:22,240
By the Oyaji hunter gang.

5458
04:31:22,240 --> 04:31:26,880
It looks like they will be in the 2nd floor locker room or in the warehouse.

5459
04:31:26,880 --> 04:31:28,840
Matsumoto will remain here...

5460
04:31:28,840 --> 04:31:32,240
because he has an injury.

5461
04:31:32,240 --> 04:31:36,010
So Hamada and Tanaka can you go?

5462
04:31:37,140 --> 04:31:40,010
Leaving Matsumoto behind,

5463
04:31:40,280 --> 04:31:44,140
Hamada and Tanaka will search for the missing duo.

5464
04:31:45,310 --> 04:31:49,610
I'm counting on you because I'm really scared.

5465
04:31:48,340 --> 04:31:49,610
I know, I got it.

5466
04:31:49,940 --> 04:31:52,440
I hate this.

5467
04:31:52,440 --> 04:31:55,710
They're going to get me hurt

5468
04:31:55,710 --> 04:32:00,610
Matsumoto Is Happy About His Partner's Misfortune

5469
04:32:02,580 --> 04:32:04,340
Wow, it's so dark.

5470
04:32:07,580 --> 04:32:09,210
For me, this was hard too.

5471
04:32:10,180 --> 04:32:11,480
Having to wait?
-Yeah.

5472
04:32:12,380 --> 04:32:13,540
Like desk work.

5473
04:32:13,540 --> 04:32:15,440
This is scary

5474
04:32:15,440 --> 04:32:18,540
Hey

5475
04:32:15,640 --> 04:32:18,540
Hey

5476
04:32:15,840 --> 04:32:18,540
Hey

5477
04:32:16,080 --> 04:32:18,540
It's so dark!

5478
04:32:21,210 --> 04:32:24,280
No, it's you Hamada-san

5479
04:32:29,080 --> 04:32:37,280
3rd FL -> 2nd FL

5480
04:32:30,080 --> 04:32:31,440
It stinks!  It really stinks!

5481
04:32:30,180 --> 04:32:34,040
You guys are disgusting
just how old are you?

5482
04:32:31,440 --> 04:32:32,780
What is this smell?

5483
04:32:32,780 --> 04:32:37,280
A Foul Odor Is Being Sprayed

5484
04:32:40,740 --> 04:32:41,510
It stinks!

5485
04:32:41,310 --> 04:32:45,180
Ranking Game Noise in

5486
04:32:41,610 --> 04:32:41,980
Stinks!

5487
04:32:41,980 --> 04:32:42,680
Stinks!

5488
04:32:43,240 --> 04:32:44,680
Did it stink?
-Yeah.

5489
04:32:45,280 --> 04:32:46,140
What is that?

5490
04:32:46,940 --> 04:32:47,640
AH!

5491
04:32:46,940 --> 04:32:47,640
AH!

5492
04:32:53,410 --> 04:32:55,180
You guys are panicking

5493
04:32:56,640 --> 04:33:00,010
What's wrong with you?

5494
04:33:02,080 --> 04:33:04,040
What is it?

5495
04:33:03,140 --> 04:33:04,280
What is it?  What is it?

5496
04:33:10,810 --> 04:33:14,810
The Game Result Is Failure

5497
04:33:15,640 --> 04:33:16,440
Tanaka!

5498
04:33:16,640 --> 04:33:18,410
What are you doing, seriously!

5499
04:33:18,610 --> 04:33:19,940
I had no clue what would happen

5500
04:33:19,140 --> 04:33:23,180
Prank in

5501
04:33:19,940 --> 04:33:21,610
You exaggerate too much

5502
04:33:29,910 --> 04:33:31,210
Are you for real?

5503
04:33:30,340 --> 04:33:33,310
Hama-chan, sorry about this morning

5504
04:33:33,310 --> 04:33:37,810
Umezu Kazuo & Umezawa Tomio

5505
04:33:38,540 --> 04:33:39,640
They were still here

5506
04:33:39,480 --> 04:33:42,980
Yamazaki & Endo Confined

5507
04:33:42,980 --> 04:33:47,110
Hamada & Tanaka Passes By

5508
04:33:47,680 --> 04:33:51,910
They Passed The Room Without Noticing

5509
04:33:48,510 --> 04:33:50,280
Why do I have to be in front?

5510
04:33:52,110 --> 04:33:53,640
That hurts!

5511
04:33:57,940 --> 04:34:01,880
Shohei's Glasses in

5512
04:34:02,310 --> 04:34:03,880
Scary!  Scary!

5513
04:34:05,680 --> 04:34:09,610
I said

5514
04:34:06,240 --> 04:34:09,610
to

5515
04:34:07,540 --> 04:34:09,610
stop falling down!

5516
04:34:13,040 --> 04:34:14,540
This is

5517
04:34:14,540 --> 04:34:17,840
Shofukutei Shohei

5518
04:34:18,440 --> 04:34:21,340
These are Shohei's glasses

5519
04:34:22,040 --> 04:34:24,640
It's going to be like this!  Definitely!

5520
04:34:26,240 --> 04:34:31,240
The Public Phone Starts Ringing

5521
04:34:35,040 --> 04:34:37,580
Wow, it says to answer the phone!

5522
04:34:40,080 --> 04:34:40,840
Hello?

5523
04:34:41,580 --> 04:34:47,710
Hello,

5524
04:34:43,910 --> 04:34:47,710
I have a question for you.

5525
04:34:47,980 --> 04:34:58,240
What do you call the person who comes in last during a race?

5526
04:34:58,580 --> 04:35:00,410
Biri!

5527
04:35:00,580 --> 04:35:04,740
How do you say it twice?

5528
04:35:02,840 --> 04:35:04,740
Biri Biri!

5529
04:35:04,910 --> 04:35:06,310
Biri

5530
04:35:04,910 --> 04:35:06,310
Biri

5531
04:35:06,410 --> 04:35:07,040
What the..?

5532
04:35:07,380 --> 04:35:09,280
Biri

5533
04:35:07,380 --> 04:35:09,280

5534
04:35:10,010 --> 04:35:13,610
Shocking Phone

5535
04:35:13,610 --> 04:35:15,780
What is this!

5536
04:35:15,780 --> 04:35:18,510
Are you alright?

5537
04:35:18,510 --> 04:35:19,910
What the hell is this!

5538
04:35:24,310 --> 04:35:27,310
Stop pushing me!

5539
04:35:24,740 --> 04:35:26,140
They were always there!

5540
04:35:28,310 --> 04:35:33,410
They Arrive At The Locker Room

5541
04:35:36,910 --> 04:35:38,580
It's so creepy

5542
04:35:40,710 --> 04:35:47,510
After The Door Appears Another Door

5543
04:35:44,580 --> 04:35:45,840
There's another door!

5544
04:35:51,910 --> 04:35:53,840
What is this? Easy life.

5545
04:35:53,380 --> 04:35:56,280
Wandering Around In The Room

5546
04:35:56,640 --> 04:35:59,440
It's fine, don't worry.  There's nothing there.

5547
04:35:56,740 --> 04:36:08,180
Shocking Door in

5548
04:35:59,440 --> 04:36:00,780
That's true, it should be fine.

5549
04:36:04,180 --> 04:36:07,740
It's not like when you open it, someone will pop out.

5550
04:36:11,240 --> 04:36:15,280
Interested in "How The World Walks"

5551
04:36:14,210 --> 04:36:16,580
Wow, they even filmed all of this

5552
04:36:15,280 --> 04:36:23,380
Shocking Door in

5553
04:36:22,740 --> 04:36:23,380
Can you see inside?

5554
04:36:27,780 --> 04:36:29,040
What are you doing?

5555
04:36:29,240 --> 04:36:32,510
Electronic Hand Gripper

5556
04:36:32,510 --> 04:36:35,480
Shocking Door in

5557
04:36:33,580 --> 04:36:34,240
I'm going.

5558
04:36:35,210 --> 04:36:36,440
Take a look inside.

5559
04:36:37,540 --> 04:36:39,440
Biri

5560
04:36:37,540 --> 04:36:39,440
Biri

5561
04:36:40,210 --> 04:36:42,110
Biri

5562
04:36:40,210 --> 04:36:42,110
Biri

5563
04:36:44,580 --> 04:36:46,580
BIRI

5564
04:36:44,580 --> 04:36:46,580
BIRI

5565
04:36:50,740 --> 04:36:56,010
Shocking Hand Gripper

5566
04:36:57,440 --> 04:36:58,980
At the same time!

5567
04:36:59,040 --> 04:37:02,410
Something feels weird

5568
04:36:59,040 --> 04:37:03,780
Locker room

5569
04:37:00,010 --> 04:37:02,140
Seriously, what is this?

5570
04:37:02,140 --> 04:37:02,410
Yeah.

5571
04:37:08,980 --> 04:37:12,710
Moving Doll in

5572
04:37:09,840 --> 04:37:10,740
This way?

5573
04:37:17,940 --> 04:37:21,010
Don't fall down, it's scary

5574
04:37:23,910 --> 04:37:27,640
Examining The Area

5575
04:37:27,980 --> 04:37:30,910
What? What was that?

5576
04:37:30,840 --> 04:37:34,710
Toy Tank Fires in

5577
04:37:44,940 --> 04:37:46,540
A stray bullet?

5578
04:37:45,810 --> 04:37:50,540
Matsumoto Receives The Same

5579
04:37:47,110 --> 04:37:48,840
Yeah

5580
04:37:52,540 --> 04:37:55,780
Why is this here?

5581
04:37:56,280 --> 04:38:01,540
Portrait

5582
04:37:56,280 --> 04:38:01,540
Tsuyoshi Takashiro

5583
04:38:00,640 --> 04:38:01,880
Maybe this way.

5584
04:38:02,280 --> 04:38:04,740
What are these things?

5585
04:38:03,640 --> 04:38:07,680
Tsuyoshi Takashiro in

5586
04:38:10,540 --> 04:38:16,110
Kannazuki Doesn't Look Like Takashiro At All

5587
04:38:10,980 --> 04:38:11,880
Thank you for your hard work!

5588
04:38:14,580 --> 04:38:15,710
Erika you're late!

5589
04:38:16,110 --> 04:38:17,210
Erika!

5590
04:38:16,240 --> 04:38:17,110
Who is Erika?

5591
04:38:17,210 --> 04:38:19,880
Who is Erika?

5592
04:38:18,410 --> 04:38:19,480
Erika you're late.

5593
04:38:19,810 --> 04:38:20,910
You scared me.

5594
04:38:21,510 --> 04:38:23,780
Hey Erika don't go!

5595
04:38:23,780 --> 04:38:26,410
ERIKA!  I SAID DON'T GO!

5596
04:38:26,540 --> 04:38:27,910
Where are you going Erika.

5597
04:38:28,080 --> 04:38:29,510
Erika!

5598
04:38:29,610 --> 04:38:31,510
Erika you can't go!

5599
04:38:33,640 --> 04:38:35,610
Someone!

5600
04:38:35,080 --> 04:38:36,410
Help us!

5601
04:38:37,180 --> 04:38:40,340
E.. E...

5602
04:38:37,510 --> 04:38:40,340
Endo and

5603
04:38:37,680 --> 04:38:40,340

5604
04:38:37,880 --> 04:38:41,910
Prank in

5605
04:38:45,810 --> 04:38:49,910
Chidegika On A Segway

5606
04:38:56,340 --> 04:38:57,280
Oh, it's here!

5607
04:39:02,410 --> 04:39:04,740
Store Room

5608
04:39:02,480 --> 04:39:04,310
Take it off?

5609
04:39:04,310 --> 04:39:05,110
Is it Ok?

5610
04:39:11,180 --> 04:39:15,210
They Have Been Saved

5611
04:39:15,210 --> 04:39:19,310
We got captured by some weird guys dressed in black.

5612
04:39:19,780 --> 04:39:26,140
I guess you saved them.  Someone reported that an Instructor has been captured

5613
04:39:26,280 --> 04:39:28,880
It seems like he is in the ground level warehouse.

5614
04:39:29,210 --> 04:39:30,910
Get over there right away.

5615
04:39:31,180 --> 04:39:32,540
At the ground level warehouse?

5616
04:39:33,040 --> 04:39:34,280
An instructor?

5617
04:39:34,940 --> 04:39:36,740
Instructor in the ground level warehouse.

5618
04:39:36,740 --> 04:39:37,280
Huh?

5619
04:39:37,780 --> 04:39:38,340
Huh?

5620
04:39:38,340 --> 04:39:39,680
What are you surprised at?

5621
04:39:47,140 --> 04:39:48,180
Someone is there, there's someone there!

5622
04:39:49,480 --> 04:39:50,380
It's the old lady.

5623
04:39:50,210 --> 04:39:54,840
The Hip Shaking Granny Is Calling Them

5624
04:39:55,380 --> 04:39:59,140
No, we have to help someone now.

5625
04:39:58,340 --> 04:39:59,480
Huh, what, what is it?

5626
04:40:01,340 --> 04:40:01,980
No way!

5627
04:40:01,580 --> 04:40:05,640
Farting Cushion in

5628
04:40:04,110 --> 04:40:05,680
How old fashioned

5629
04:40:09,340 --> 04:40:11,110
Tanaka, you exaggerate too much.

5630
04:40:12,680 --> 04:40:13,440
You...

5631
04:40:21,380 --> 04:40:23,540
Surprise Comedy Routine

5632
04:40:24,210 --> 04:40:26,540
What does this mean?

5633
04:40:27,180 --> 04:40:31,910
The Healthy Boys

5634
04:40:32,980 --> 04:40:38,440

Healthy!

5639
04:40:46,010 --> 04:40:52,580
This guy looks like he is training hard everyday, but he knows nothing about muscles.

5640
04:40:52,580 --> 04:40:57,710
No, these are real muscles, but you have no knowledge about muscles.

5641
04:40:57,710 --> 04:41:02,010
How about a quiz about muscles to see who knows the most?

5642
04:41:02,010 --> 04:41:04,180
Ok, let's do it!

5643
04:41:04,310 --> 04:41:07,710
What is known as the king of exercises

5644
04:41:07,710 --> 04:41:11,180
that is great for the lower body?

5645
04:41:09,610 --> 04:41:11,180
Squat!

5646
04:41:10,740 --> 04:41:11,180
Correct!

5647
04:41:11,310 --> 04:41:14,540
So then, what is good for training

5648
04:41:14,540 --> 04:41:18,010
the back muscles...

5649
04:41:16,340 --> 04:41:18,010
Lat pull down!

5650
04:41:17,140 --> 04:41:18,010
Correct!

5651
04:41:18,080 --> 04:41:19,940
What type of pants do bodybuilders like

5652
04:41:19,940 --> 04:41:24,080
that has a lot of room down below?

5653
04:41:22,280 --> 04:41:24,080
Baggy Pants!

5654
04:41:22,980 --> 04:41:24,080
Correct!

5655
04:41:24,140 --> 04:41:26,240
The opposite of...

5656
04:41:24,580 --> 04:41:26,240
Tights!

5657
04:41:25,440 --> 04:41:26,240
Correct!

5658
04:41:26,310 --> 04:41:32,580
What is the sports gym, 3 mins away from Namba Grand Kagetsu?

5659
04:41:30,340 --> 04:41:32,580
Dipness Namba!

5660
04:41:31,440 --> 04:41:32,580
Correct!

5661
04:41:32,580 --> 04:41:35,540
Who, when Dipness Namba first opened

5662
04:41:35,540 --> 04:41:40,810
forgot their ID at the front desk and caused a scene?

5663
04:41:39,640 --> 04:41:40,810
Hanshin Shisho!

5664
04:41:40,540 --> 04:41:40,810

04:41:46,440 --> 04:41:49,740
What do the customers think of Hirao-san?

5669
04:41:47,940 --> 04:41:49,740
He's the best!

5670
04:41:49,440 --> 04:41:49,740
Correct!

5671
