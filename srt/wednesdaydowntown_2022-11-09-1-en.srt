00:00:02,840 --> 00:00:04,350
Welcome to Wednesday Downtown,

2
00:00:06,350 --> 00:00:09,390
Let’s get on with our first presenter please

3
00:00:14,960 --> 00:00:16,960
It's Jinnai Tomonori!

4
00:00:16,960 --> 00:00:19,400
Yes, it's me

5
00:00:19,400 --> 00:00:24,530
So, this time I've brought an annual project

6
00:00:25,390 --> 00:00:28,750
The 8th Best Lyrics Adaptation Championship

7
00:00:28,750 --> 00:00:30,550
Here we go

8
00:00:30,550 --> 00:00:32,040
Is it the 8th edition already?

9
00:00:32,040 --> 00:00:34,210
It's the 8th year, the 8th edition

10
00:00:34,350 --> 00:00:38,180
This is much more anticipated than other competitions

11
00:00:38,180 --> 00:00:40,920
In the 6th and 7th, Hollywood Zakoshi dominated

12
00:00:40,920 --> 00:00:42,370
Impressive

13
00:00:42,370 --> 00:00:45,140
He's obviously good, but I don't remember it

14
00:00:45,140 --> 00:00:46,600
Indeed
-Only remember watching it

15
00:00:46,600 --> 00:00:48,890
But this time the judges have also changed

16
00:00:48,890 --> 00:00:51,990
The jury for the 8th edition is senior citizens

17
00:00:52,960 --> 00:00:54,430
The age has gone up again

18
00:00:54,430 --> 00:00:57,100
Seniors over 75 years old are the judges

19
00:00:57,100 --> 00:00:58,400
That's...

20
00:00:58,400 --> 00:01:01,240
Is this so Hollywood Zakoshi doesn't win again?

21
00:01:01,240 --> 00:01:04,480
If its the same as before he'll just win again

22
00:01:04,480 --> 00:01:05,870
How dare you admit it?

23
00:01:06,800 --> 00:01:09,410
No, he is still able to win!

24
00:01:09,410 --> 00:01:12,080
Just like Ernesto Hoost
-Indeed, indeed.

25
00:01:12,880 --> 00:01:14,320
The Annual Competition

26
00:01:14,320 --> 00:01:16,840
Celebrating its 8th edition this year

27
00:01:16,840 --> 00:01:19,530
The Best Adaptation Lyrics Tournament

28
00:01:20,330 --> 00:01:23,730
Tonight, a new group of eight singing comedians assemble

29
00:01:25,640 --> 00:01:29,300
This time the judges are senior citizens

30
00:01:29,300 --> 00:01:30,500
Senior citizens?

31
00:01:30,500 --> 00:01:37,140
I feel like older people will laugh if they're encouraged to

32
00:01:37,140 --> 00:01:39,710
More-so than young people

33
00:01:40,080 --> 00:01:43,320
The elderly may laugh at those who sing well

34
00:01:43,320 --> 00:01:48,420
They definitely prefer people who can sing well, so I'm really in the running

35
00:01:49,320 --> 00:01:51,690
I have a very powerful secret strategy

36
00:01:51,920 --> 00:01:57,260
If you curry favor with them, it's possible to win by a large margin

37
00:01:56,400 --> 00:01:57,990
Really?

38
00:01:57,990 --> 00:02:02,170
They are my most important target audience

39
00:02:02,430 --> 00:02:08,240
I originally became a comedian in order to make older people laugh

40
00:02:06,600 --> 00:02:08,510
Already bullshit.
-Already lying!

41
00:02:08,240 --> 00:02:10,000
Right in the center of the bullseye

42
00:02:10,340 --> 00:02:15,110
I often consider whether I can capture the hearts of that age group of viewers

43
00:02:15,250 --> 00:02:18,450
I also adapt lyrics to sing to senior citizens

44
00:02:18,450 --> 00:02:20,220
For example, Hibari Misora

45
00:02:20,220 --> 00:02:27,590
"Ahhhhh, the flow of water, help me"

46
00:02:27,590 --> 00:02:28,760
It can be triggered at once

47
00:02:29,460 --> 00:02:34,200
I actually did not want to become a parody artist

48
00:02:34,370 --> 00:02:37,340
Actually, I wanted to be a lyric rewriter

49
00:02:37,340 --> 00:02:40,240
So I'm planning to debut today

50
00:02:40,710 --> 00:02:44,280
Hey, how come no one has been able to defeat me?

51
00:02:44,280 --> 00:02:46,080
You guys, come out!

52
00:02:46,080 --> 00:02:48,480
Gos Gos Gos Gos

53
00:02:49,400 --> 00:02:50,250
Huh?

54
00:02:50,250 --> 00:02:52,480
The above 8 are the participants

55
00:02:53,230 --> 00:02:57,720
From the first round to the final round, they will adapt the lyrics of three designated songs

56
00:02:58,660 --> 00:03:00,410
The judges are...

57
00:03:00,410 --> 00:03:04,140
51 seniors aged 75 or older

58
00:03:05,580 --> 00:03:07,410
The oldest age is 88 years old

59
00:03:07,410 --> 00:03:11,680
Who will be able to capture the hearts of the older people to win the title?

60
00:03:12,230 --> 00:03:13,370
And!

61
00:03:17,490 --> 00:03:21,470
Kuro-chan's new serialization project begins after a 3 year absence

62
00:03:22,550 --> 00:03:24,250
I don't understand, what is this?

63
00:03:24,250 --> 00:03:25,720
This Wednesday, right?

64
00:03:42,260 --> 00:03:44,120
The Best Adaptation Lyrics Tournament

65
00:03:44,120 --> 00:03:46,720
First, the matchup for the first round is:

66
00:03:51,120 --> 00:03:56,410
♬ We are in the third year of high school~

67
00:03:53,610 --> 00:03:55,820
The song selection is suitable for the elderly

68
00:03:55,820 --> 00:03:58,050
Released about 60 years ago

69
00:03:56,840 --> 00:04:00,190
♬ Although we're going to go our separate ways~

70
00:03:58,050 --> 00:04:01,460
With a cumulative circulation of 2.3 million copies

71
00:04:00,720 --> 00:04:08,780
♬But we are brothers forever ~

72
00:04:01,650 --> 00:04:05,200
Kazuo Funaki's debut song "Senior year of high school"

73
00:04:05,710 --> 00:04:08,790
How will the 8 contestants adapt the lyrics of the song?

74
00:04:10,650 --> 00:04:12,280
Round 1, Game 1

75
00:04:11,870 --> 00:04:13,900
A guitarist battle

76
00:04:15,600 --> 00:04:17,280
Old and new generation dueling

77
00:04:17,370 --> 00:04:24,380
♬ With a red shoulder, I'm 60 years old

78
00:04:24,540 --> 00:04:31,740
♬ I can't remember the names of the people

79
00:04:31,780 --> 00:04:40,130
♬ Ahhhhhhh~ Who is this person?

80
00:04:40,160 --> 00:04:44,730
♬  I have an impression of his face, should be an acquaintance

81
00:04:44,960 --> 00:04:48,800
♬ Now I remember

82
00:04:49,100 --> 00:04:53,840
♬ It's my brother

83
00:04:54,060 --> 00:04:55,600
Slow and clear

84
00:04:55,600 --> 00:04:57,140
Surprisingly quite honest

85
00:04:57,150 --> 00:05:00,190
Using a silver-haired approach

86
00:05:00,190 --> 00:05:04,150
He wins the laughter of the elderly

87
00:05:04,840 --> 00:05:06,750
Now the challenger

88
00:05:08,380 --> 00:05:09,490
Can he do it?

89
00:05:13,330 --> 00:05:21,300
Vocal YU-KI Dancer SAM

90
00:05:21,300 --> 00:05:28,240
♬ ETSU and CHIHARU DJ KOO

91
00:05:27,950 --> 00:05:29,190
They won't get it

92
00:05:28,760 --> 00:05:36,480
All members of the band TRF formed by Tetsuya Komuro

93
00:05:28,840 --> 00:05:36,480
♬ Ahhhhhhhh~ The TRF that everyone knows

94
00:05:36,150 --> 00:05:37,680
We don't all know it!

95
00:05:37,480 --> 00:05:46,590
♬ Now only DJ KOO is still lively

96
00:05:38,460 --> 00:05:39,370
This one's lost, right?

97
00:05:40,960 --> 00:05:42,280
Not known

98
00:05:46,590 --> 00:05:50,240
♬ Only KOO is still lively

99
00:05:49,110 --> 00:05:51,350
That's not good.
-No, it's not

100
00:05:51,800 --> 00:05:54,760
They don't get it

101
00:05:56,840 --> 00:05:58,770
Both sides have finished singing

102
00:05:58,770 --> 00:05:59,710
When it comes to the judging session

103
00:06:00,880 --> 00:06:06,640
51 seniors press the button of the side they find interesting

104
00:06:06,640 --> 00:06:08,880
The winner is determined by the number of votes cast

105
00:06:08,880 --> 00:06:12,280
You didn't press the wrong button, did you?

106
00:06:12,290 --> 00:06:14,640
Please forgive them for that

107
00:06:15,560 --> 00:06:20,520
How will the elders judge this matchup?

108
00:06:21,160 --> 00:06:22,520
Round 1, Game 1

109
00:06:22,520 --> 00:06:24,410
The results are as follows

110
00:06:25,850 --> 00:06:28,680
Tatsuo Kamon with 49 votes

111
00:06:28,680 --> 00:06:31,390
Shinichi, 2 votes

112
00:06:31,390 --> 00:06:34,100
So the confirmed semi-finalist is Tatsuo Kamon

113
00:06:34,100 --> 00:06:36,260
Congratulations
-Thank you

114
00:06:37,110 --> 00:06:39,740
Just 2 votes...?

115
00:06:39,780 --> 00:06:44,350
Q.What did you like about Tatsuo Kamon?

116
00:06:40,610 --> 00:06:44,360
I heard myself in his songs and it felt interesting

117
00:06:44,650 --> 00:06:48,550
The 2nd one i'm a bit unsure what he was singing about

118
00:06:45,720 --> 00:06:47,570
Mask, mask!

119
00:06:49,300 --> 00:06:52,470
Next in The Best Adapted Lyrics Tournament is...

120
00:06:53,530 --> 00:06:55,190
Round 1, Game 2

121
00:06:55,190 --> 00:06:57,970
First is Razor Ramon RG

122
00:07:07,640 --> 00:07:12,040
I am from North Island Music Office

123
00:07:12,240 --> 00:07:14,450
My name is Ooe Yutaka

124
00:07:15,020 --> 00:07:17,820
Very similar

125
00:07:17,820 --> 00:07:19,380
So, music start!

126
00:07:23,690 --> 00:07:31,600
♬ The black part takes up most of the eye

127
00:07:31,690 --> 00:07:38,880
I don't know which way I'm looking

128
00:07:39,200 --> 00:07:47,710
♬ Ahhh~ black eyes~ black eyes~ almost black eyes~

129
00:07:47,780 --> 00:07:52,650
♬ The eyes always feel like I've seen

130
00:07:52,850 --> 00:08:04,100
♬ The eyes of the great white shark that attacks humans

131
00:08:05,040 --> 00:08:07,040
What will happen?

132
00:08:08,930 --> 00:08:13,340
RG uses a secret strategy of black eye color pupils to win or lose

133
00:08:13,340 --> 00:08:19,620
He is competing with the three-time champion, the Hollywood Zakoshi

134
00:08:19,950 --> 00:08:20,520
Good luck

135
00:08:24,620 --> 00:08:32,620
♬ Ambala Kambara Hangma Kangma

136
00:08:28,110 --> 00:08:33,180
This is bad
-Risky

137
00:08:32,720 --> 00:08:39,630
♬ Dongdonglong Bobolong Hangma Kangma

138
00:08:34,970 --> 00:08:38,650
Champion
-Why sing this?

139
00:08:38,880 --> 00:08:40,240
It's not very good, is it?

140
00:08:40,330 --> 00:08:48,210
♬ Hey ~ I'm Jinsaburo Furuhata

141
00:08:48,810 --> 00:08:53,810
♬ Can you wait? Hangma Kangma Hangma Kangma

142
00:08:52,090 --> 00:08:53,280
It's not even an adaptation of lyrics anymore, right?

143
00:08:54,080 --> 00:09:01,720
♬ I've noticed the atmosphere here

144
00:08:55,640 --> 00:08:57,330
Just end it

145
00:09:01,720 --> 00:09:05,260
♬ Hangma Kangma I am Furuhata

146
00:09:03,080 --> 00:09:04,290
What will happen?

147
00:09:05,770 --> 00:09:07,160
Very good, very good!

148
00:09:08,340 --> 00:09:11,280
It's an even match.
-What will be the result?

149
00:09:11,280 --> 00:09:13,420
Neither side of the audience seemed to be immersed

150
00:09:13,420 --> 00:09:16,040
The outcome of this matchup is...

151
00:09:17,470 --> 00:09:22,410
RG 14 votes, Zakoshi 37 votes

152
00:09:22,410 --> 00:09:24,990
So the semi-finalist is Hollywood Zakoshi

153
00:09:24,990 --> 00:09:26,600
He's surprised

154
00:09:27,240 --> 00:09:28,650
Congratulations
-Thanks

155
00:09:28,710 --> 00:09:30,950
You're scary, your eyes

156
00:09:31,480 --> 00:09:34,050
The eyes are really scary, if you look close

157
00:09:34,050 --> 00:09:36,230
The black eye is too big, it's too much

158
00:09:37,120 --> 00:09:39,620
My name is Ooe Yutaka

159
00:09:39,620 --> 00:09:47,900
Q. What did you like about Zakoshi?

160
00:09:40,460 --> 00:09:42,430
Although I do not understand what he was singing

161
00:09:42,630 --> 00:09:47,900
He spoke very clearly, that was good

162
00:09:48,300 --> 00:09:52,600
Ooe, I didn't understanding what he was singing

163
00:09:52,600 --> 00:09:55,440
A little scary...

164
00:09:53,850 --> 00:09:55,220
I see.
-The eyes!

165
00:09:55,220 --> 00:09:55,880
Too bad

166
00:09:55,570 --> 00:09:58,010
That guy, it's not funny enough to please the audience

167
00:09:58,010 --> 00:10:00,680
It's a shame, isn't it? That guy

168
00:10:00,680 --> 00:10:02,850
I still need to continue to sharpen

169
00:10:02,850 --> 00:10:07,490
And send songs across the country

170
00:10:06,390 --> 00:10:07,490
It's Ooe

171
00:10:07,490 --> 00:10:11,160
Next in the Best Adapted Lyrics Tournament is...

172
00:10:12,710 --> 00:10:14,480
Round 1, Match 3

173
00:10:14,480 --> 00:10:16,620
First is Chance Oshiro

174
00:10:21,530 --> 00:10:29,200
♬ Red F1 car Michael Schumacher

175
00:10:33,610 --> 00:10:37,120
♬ Got knocked down~

176
00:10:37,150 --> 00:10:44,930
♬ Ahhhhhhhh~ 3 months to heal

177
00:10:45,690 --> 00:10:50,630
♬ Immediately rejuvenated

178
00:10:50,800 --> 00:10:53,630
♬ Jumping and skipping

179
00:10:54,600 --> 00:10:58,140
♬ My wife also jumped out

180
00:10:58,140 --> 00:11:02,260
It suddenly became very Chance

181
00:11:04,210 --> 00:11:06,080
Why're they not the same size

182
00:11:06,470 --> 00:11:08,380

Pay attention to your attitude

246
00:15:28,740 --> 00:15:32,280
I said so many kind words

247
00:15:32,280 --> 00:15:34,870
Why? Isn't this the K-1 generation?

248
00:15:35,310 --> 00:15:36,580
Of course not, no matter how you think

249
00:15:36,580 --> 00:15:38,180

Didn't you say this was a meeting of relatives of Director Ishii?

255
00:15:51,460 --> 00:15:52,530
In such a way you'd win?

Of course i'd win, you bastard

257
00:15:53,530 --> 00:15:55,570
It's Ignashov

He's got a ruthless knee

259
00:15:57,540 --> 00:15:58,780

No. Do they not watch the news?

287
00:18:30,420 --> 00:18:33,210
I also deliberately chose the news that people of this age would know

288
00:18:33,210 --> 00:18:34,730
This is not completely unfunny

When talking about eating wrist hair

317
00:20:34,980 --> 00:20:36,710
I thought, "Oh, this is not good"

318
00:20:36,710 --> 00:20:38,410
"I'm not supposed to talk about this"

319

♬ It's a very famous song

340
00:22:19,580 --> 00:22:21,240
It's not an adaptation of a song at all

341
00:22:20,550 --> 00:22:22,860
♬ It's a song about the separation of men and women

342
00:22:23,050 --> 00:22:26,590
♬ But when it comes to the real most important difference

343
00:22:26,880 --> 00:22:28,960
♬ Actually, it's the separation from life

344
00:22:29,090 --> 00:22:31,060
♬ You may be approaching that moment

345
00:22:31,360 --> 00:22:35,870
When the funeral takes place, the staff will securely close the coffin door

346
00:22:35,870 --> 00:22:40,000
♬ And then, although the name will be eliminated, you will get the precepts

347
00:22:40,270 --> 00:22:44,270
♬ And at that time, what did Lord Buddha say?

348
00:22:44,270 --> 00:22:48,410
♬ In order for that day to come, we must actively survive

349
00:22:48,590 --> 00:22:50,080

♬ Thank you for listening

351
00:22:51,620 --> 00:22:53,210
If she wins this...

00:22:54,020 --> 00:22:56,280
After all, it is a song adaptation tournament

353
00:22:56,960 --> 00:23:00,590

354
00:23:01,340 --> 00:23:04,300

00:23:10,840 --> 00:23:14,830
Kamon 32 votes, Shimizu 19 votes

357
00:23:14,830 --> 00:23:18,750
So the winner is Kamon Tatsuo. Congratulations!

358
00:23:19,830 --> 00:23:22,150
Kamon, How do you feel now?

359
00:23:22,450 --> 00:23:27,390
Next, I will focus on this age group and continue to sing

360
00:23:27,390 --> 00:23:28,890
Although it's a shame

361
00:23:28,890 --> 00:23:31,820
I never thought I would make it this far

362
00:23:31,820 --> 00:23:33,320
Already very happy

363
00:23:34,060 --> 00:23:41,660
To sum up, the winner of the 8th Best Lyrics Adaptation Tournament is Kamon Tatsuo

364
00:23:43,180 --> 00:23:46,860
Okay, so the 8th winner is Kamon Tatsuo

365
00:23:47,220 --> 00:23:48,950
Ah, that...

366
00:23:48,950 --> 00:23:51,360
He was good, and superior to the rest

367
00:23:51,360 --> 00:23:56,120
But there are also various interludes

368
00:23:56,120 --> 00:23:59,720
Everyone was interesting in their own way

369
00:23:59,720 --> 00:24:04,150
Only Shinichi was not good

370
00:24:04,150 --> 00:24:05,490
That guy is going to hang his head in shame

371
00:24:05,490 --> 00:24:08,490
Neither the elderly nor us were feeling it

372
00:24:08,490 --> 00:24:09,860
We should understand at the very least

373
00:24:10,760 --> 00:24:11,370
True

374
00:24:11,370 --> 00:24:14,130
This time I found that the judges to be quite unique

375
00:24:14,130 --> 00:24:16,800
But no foreigners has been invited to be a judges
-Yes.

376
00:24:17,240 --> 00:24:19,510
Maybe at some point

377
00:24:19,510 --> 00:24:22,230
But no matter what age you are, domestic or foreign

378
00:24:22,810 --> 00:24:26,910
Everyone will feel that Shinichi is not interesting

379
00:24:27,320 --> 00:24:31,050
All eyes on him will not be moved

380
00:24:31,050 --> 00:24:31,890
Judges?

381
00:24:31,890 --> 00:24:33,220
The eyes of the judges on him?

382
00:24:33,220 --> 00:24:35,190
What is that all about?

383
00:24:37,320 --> 00:24:39,790
Let's welcome the next presenter

384
00:24:44,050 --> 00:24:44,610
Ahhh

385
00:24:45,410 --> 00:24:48,170
Yes, its Fujiwara

386
00:24:48,170 --> 00:24:49,300
Just Fujimon?

387
00:24:49,300 --> 00:24:51,300
Just Fujimon

388
00:24:52,950 --> 00:24:54,010
It's here, everyone

389
00:24:54,010 --> 00:24:55,060
What?

390
00:24:55,060 --> 00:24:57,540
The long-awaited Kuro-chan project

391
00:24:57,540 --> 00:24:58,950
Great!
-The worst

392
00:24:58,950 --> 00:25:00,180
Don't say "the worst"

393
00:25:00,180 --> 00:25:01,980
The coexistence of "great" and "the worst"

394
00:25:01,980 --> 00:25:05,150
Polarization
-Is everything okay?

395
00:25:05,150 --> 00:25:08,320
So, please take a look
-Okay

396
00:25:12,970 --> 00:25:15,140
Beautifully done

397
00:25:18,170 --> 00:25:23,260
Standing there are 9 ladies in dresses

398
00:25:27,570 --> 00:25:28,970
Eh?

399
00:25:29,600 --> 00:25:30,680
Here we go again

400
00:25:32,310 --> 00:25:33,380
What's going on?

401
00:25:32,380 --> 00:25:33,320
A familiar opening

402
00:25:33,380 --> 00:25:36,450
Such a loud echo, what is this?

403
00:25:36,450 --> 00:25:39,450
Where is this? Where am I? A building?

404
00:25:43,960 --> 00:25:44,670
What?

405
00:25:46,490 --> 00:25:49,630
It's so spacious, isn't it? Where is this?

406
00:25:49,630 --> 00:25:51,560
What a big echo

407
00:25:51,730 --> 00:25:52,900
Have we arrived?

408
00:25:53,330 --> 00:25:55,070
Hey, are we there yet?

409
00:25:55,300 --> 00:25:58,000
So, Kuro-chan
Don't say the same as Agnes Chan

410
00:25:58,000 --> 00:25:59,140
Nobody said anything

411
00:25:58,370 --> 00:25:59,140
What?

412
00:25:59,140 --> 00:26:00,770
Please take off the blindfold

413
00:26:00,000 --> 00:26:01,190
No one said anything at all

414
00:26:01,510 --> 00:26:02,970
I took it off!

415
00:26:08,010 --> 00:26:10,250
Eh?

416
00:26:12,000 --> 00:26:13,100
What's this?

417
00:26:13,180 --> 00:26:14,920
What... women?

418
00:26:14,680 --> 00:26:15,370
"Women"

419
00:26:14,990 --> 00:26:16,760
I don't get it. What is this?

420
00:26:16,760 --> 00:26:18,790
It's Wednesday, right?

421
00:26:18,790 --> 00:26:21,090
It's Wednesday... right?

422
00:26:20,680 --> 00:26:21,440
He's scared

423
00:26:21,260 --> 00:26:25,360
So, do you ladies want to ask Kuro-chan anything?

424
00:26:25,460 --> 00:26:27,130
I do

425
00:26:27,130 --> 00:26:30,000
Are there any girls among us that you like?

426
00:26:29,800 --> 00:26:30,570
What?

427
00:26:30,570 --> 00:26:31,960
Any I like?
-Yes

428
00:26:34,300 --> 00:26:36,840
Well... you're all cute

429
00:26:37,010 --> 00:26:40,340
Seriously, everyone is so cute

430
00:26:42,010 --> 00:26:45,980
Ah, of course, Nami who asked the question

431
00:26:45,980 --> 00:26:47,150
Ah, I'm Mina

432
00:26:47,120 --> 00:26:49,500
It's hopeless.
-How can he get both characters wrong

433
00:26:47,550 --> 00:26:50,290
Ah...

434
00:26:49,500 --> 00:26:50,570
He misread it

435
00:26:50,520 --> 00:26:55,390
So do any of you like me?

436
00:26:56,990 --> 00:26:59,030
Eh?

437
00:26:58,200 --> 00:26:59,360
What do you mean?

438
00:26:59,360 --> 00:27:00,660
Everyone?

439
00:27:00,170 --> 00:27:01,960
Really?
-How is it possible?

440
00:27:00,760 --> 00:27:02,270
Eh?

441
00:27:02,270 --> 00:27:04,300
I really like you

442
00:27:04,430 --> 00:27:07,400
What is this? Wait!

443
00:27:06,890 --> 00:27:07,700
Can't figure it out

444
00:27:07,700 --> 00:27:11,810
I don't understand. I've never met such a person

445
00:27:12,180 --> 00:27:14,140
This is Wednesday, right?

446
00:27:14,380 --> 00:27:19,080
All the ladies here like Kuro-chan

447
00:27:18,280 --> 00:27:19,930
Really?
-How is it possible?

448
00:27:19,250 --> 00:27:23,880
Eventually you will choose one of them to confess to

449
00:27:24,290 --> 00:27:27,190
The goal is to become a couple

450
00:27:27,920 --> 00:27:32,360
You all just raised your hands, it's not a lie, right?

451
00:27:32,800 --> 00:27:36,670
You all raised your hands but expressing love is not so simple

452
00:27:37,300 --> 00:27:40,640
Like shouting "yes"

453
00:27:39,150 --> 00:27:40,880
He's really looking after himself

454
00:27:41,200 --> 00:27:42,710
Yes

455
00:27:42,480 --> 00:27:43,380
It's like this

456
00:27:42,970 --> 00:27:45,240
Still a bit quiet...

457
00:27:43,880 --> 00:27:45,880
What's wrong with this guy?

458
00:27:45,910 --> 00:27:48,310
Raise your hand if you like Kuro-chan

459
00:27:48,310 --> 00:27:50,150
I do

460
00:27:50,950 --> 00:27:52,220
It can be done, can't it?

461
00:27:55,110 --> 00:27:58,030
I can't watch
-The light in the eyes

462
00:27:58,990 --> 00:27:59,720
Ah

463
00:28:00,270 --> 00:28:06,530
So, is this the result of Wedneday's call for "people that like Kuro-chan?"

464
00:28:05,070 --> 00:28:06,530
Yes

465
00:28:06,530 --> 00:28:07,970
Did you collect them?

466
00:28:06,700 --> 00:28:12,740
In April a notice was sent out to recruit

467
00:28:08,940 --> 00:28:11,140
There was such a thing.
-That's right

468
00:28:11,140 --> 00:28:12,740
Do you really like me?

469
00:28:12,840 --> 00:28:15,640
Yes

470
00:28:14,520 --> 00:28:15,880
Can you find so many?

471
00:28:15,910 --> 00:28:18,440
Great, not just a random girlfriend

472
00:28:18,440 --> 00:28:19,340
What the hell are you looking for?

473
00:28:21,040 --> 00:28:22,750
So, Kuro-chan
-Yes

474
00:28:22,750 --> 00:28:25,250
Please change into clothes that match the ladies

475
00:28:25,550 --> 00:28:26,560
Wait for me!

476
00:28:27,020 --> 00:28:28,520
OK

477
00:28:27,050 --> 00:28:29,960
Such a quick attitude change

478
00:28:29,960 --> 00:28:31,850
We know they all like him

479
00:28:32,520 --> 00:28:33,820
It's Kuro-chan

480
00:28:36,130 --> 00:28:36,720
What?

481
00:28:37,940 --> 00:28:39,480
This expression is really bad

482
00:28:39,480 --> 00:28:41,770
Just go!
-Indeed

483
00:28:43,420 --> 00:28:45,920
Awesome, what is this?
-There are so many

484
00:28:46,880 --> 00:28:48,080
Everyone is so cute

485
00:28:48,820 --> 00:28:50,930
Yes, they are very beautiful

486
00:28:51,800 --> 00:28:53,160
MONSTER LOVE

487
00:28:54,160 --> 00:28:55,160
What's this?

488
00:28:55,160 --> 00:29:00,820
So, Kuro-chan's new project has officially begun

489
00:29:00,820 --> 00:29:04,500
First MONSTER HOUSE, then MONSTER IDOL

490
00:29:04,500 --> 00:29:08,570
After 3 years the third edition of the MONSTER series is here

491
00:29:08,930 --> 00:29:14,000
In April this year, the program team recruited women who really like Kuro-chan

492
00:29:14,680 --> 00:29:19,140
Yes, it took a lot of time to prepare, but finally the project has begun

493
00:29:19,140 --> 00:29:21,220
Really?
-There's a lot of them

494
00:29:21,220 --> 00:29:23,820
But this time it all involves girls who say they like him

495
00:29:23,820 --> 00:29:27,170
Kuro-chan can build upon his past experiences, right?

496
00:29:27,170 --> 00:29:30,450
If this project is to see Kuro-chan find happiness

497
00:29:30,450 --> 00:29:34,520
I don't want to see it.
-Sometimes it's good to have something like this

498
00:29:34,520 --> 00:29:37,250
Is it that simple?

499
00:29:37,250 --> 00:29:41,090
I understand people may feel a bit conflicted

500
00:29:41,090 --> 00:29:45,020
Kuro-chan's dirty side comes out really quickly
-Super quick!

501
00:29:45,020 --> 00:29:48,170
With people that like him
-He'll be unrestrained

502
00:29:48,170 --> 00:29:49,680
That's what I want to see

503
00:29:50,440 --> 00:29:53,540
Will we be able to see it?
-It's already on display!

504
00:29:53,550 --> 00:29:54,910
Enough is enough

505
00:29:54,910 --> 00:29:55,810
It's already showing a bit

506
00:29:55,810 --> 00:29:57,400
I just want to watch and despise him at the same time

507
00:29:57,400 --> 00:30:00,280
The last wave when leaving the room

508
00:30:00,280 --> 00:30:04,250
The waving action is disgusting, so disgusting

509
00:30:04,250 --> 00:30:05,350
Just want to see this

510
00:30:05,350 --> 00:30:10,950
Okay, folks, let's get on with it, please

511
00:30:13,560 --> 00:30:14,490
Hello everyone

512
00:30:17,830 --> 00:30:19,590
Hello everyone

513
00:30:19,800 --> 00:30:22,070
Cute!

514
00:30:21,250 --> 00:30:21,990
Cute?

515
00:30:22,200 --> 00:30:23,870
Thank you big ~heart~yo~

516
00:30:23,870 --> 00:30:27,000
Everyone's Kuro-chan has appeared

517
00:30:24,440 --> 00:30:25,950
Thank you big ~heart~yo~

518
00:30:27,200 --> 00:30:29,200
I'm coming to the heart~yo, I'm coming to the heart~yo

519
00:30:27,920 --> 00:30:29,870
So smug

520
00:30:29,870 --> 00:30:33,030
With "heart" at the end of his words, it means he is in a good mood

521
00:30:32,840 --> 00:30:35,710
I changed into formal wear to match everyone

522
00:30:35,710 --> 00:30:36,450
What do you think of Kuro-chan?

523
00:30:36,780 --> 00:30:38,220
So handsome

524
00:30:38,420 --> 00:30:41,020
The tie suits you
-Oh, it's nice

525
00:30:41,020 --> 00:30:44,890
I do not hate this kind of complement ~heart~yo~

526
00:30:44,110 --> 00:30:47,440
What's wrong with this guy?
-I can't watch

527
00:30:45,060 --> 00:30:49,680
Here we go. One, two, cheers.
-Cheers!

528
00:30:49,790 --> 00:30:52,630
Meeting everyone, the mood is so good!

529
00:30:52,630 --> 00:30:54,840
Ok ok, ba-bu!

530
00:30:55,900 --> 00:30:58,170
So interesting

531
00:30:56,600 --> 00:30:58,170
What's so interesting?

532
00:30:58,170 --> 00:31:01,540
Here we go. "Interesting" Cheers!

533
00:31:00,160 --> 00:31:03,690
"Interesting", it's just not at all

534
00:31:03,710 --> 00:31:06,640
I always follow him online

535
00:31:06,640 --> 00:31:11,630
He is better in person than I thought, really handsome

536
00:31:10,040 --> 00:31:11,150
Seriously?

537
00:31:11,150 --> 00:31:11,870
Sincerely?

538
00:31:11,610 --> 00:31:17,320
He's cuter than I thought, like a mascot

539
00:31:14,850 --> 00:31:15,710
Really?

540
00:31:17,310 --> 00:31:18,440
Not at all, okay?

541
00:31:17,620 --> 00:31:20,260
I already thought he is very handsome

542
00:31:20,200 --> 00:31:21,080
Really?

543
00:31:20,360 --> 00:31:22,960
But he's more handsome than I realized

544
00:31:22,900 --> 00:31:23,880
Seriously?

545
00:31:22,960 --> 00:31:26,060
He's becoming more and more attractive

546
00:31:27,710 --> 00:31:29,070
Genuinely?

547
00:31:28,930 --> 00:31:33,850
I've never experienced this feeling of being a king before

548
00:31:34,000 --> 00:31:37,640
Finally, Wednesday is doing something good for me

549
00:31:38,710 --> 00:31:41,040
This time if it really becomes...

550
00:31:41,440 --> 00:31:43,200
I have a 10-year window, 10 years

551
00:31:43,200 --> 00:31:44,810
I'll really be dating

552
00:31:45,080 --> 00:31:47,590
You've all prepared so much

553
00:31:47,590 --> 00:31:50,920
No matter what, I have to seriously decide

554
00:31:50,920 --> 00:31:55,150
If I can't find someone here, I won't be able to find anyone in life

555
00:31:54,200 --> 00:31:55,120
Manly

556
00:31:55,430 --> 00:31:57,510
Do you guys have any preferences? Its important to know

557
00:31:57,930 --> 00:31:59,670
Everyone's fetishes are different

558
00:32:00,820 --> 00:32:03,870
What about you, Mana?

559
00:32:03,880 --> 00:32:05,190
This sitting position...

560
00:32:07,270 --> 00:32:09,740
I like sound

561
00:32:09,740 --> 00:32:10,600
The voice

562
00:32:10,770 --> 00:32:13,760
I like hands

563
00:32:13,760 --> 00:32:17,840
I like older men

564
00:32:18,180 --> 00:32:22,160
The age difference with Kuro-chan is the one I like the most

565
00:32:21,630 --> 00:32:23,720
Everyone's very direct

566
00:32:22,150 --> 00:32:25,110
What about Kuro-chan?

567
00:32:25,320 --> 00:32:32,320
I like to see the food in a girl's mouth when she eats

568
00:32:37,800 --> 00:32:39,500
That's very chic

569
00:32:39,900 --> 00:32:42,140
The mouth

570
00:32:42,150 --> 00:32:44,320
I want to see it

571
00:32:46,340 --> 00:32:49,610
But who~ but who~

572
00:32:49,130 --> 00:32:49,810
Awful!

573
00:32:49,610 --> 00:32:55,550
I want to see Richi who's covering her face with champagne

574
00:32:54,640 --> 00:32:56,560
Poor thing
-She's been chosen

575
00:32:55,550 --> 00:32:57,550
Want to see it?
-I want to see it~

576
00:32:57,550 --> 00:32:58,880
What to do?

577
00:32:58,170 --> 00:32:59,440
Want to see it~

578
00:32:59,620 --> 00:33:01,690
Which should I eat?

579
00:32:59,890 --> 00:33:01,200
She's happy to be chosen

580
00:33:01,200 --> 00:33:02,680
She loves it

581
00:33:01,690 --> 00:33:04,160
Wait, I'll choose, which one to choose...

582
00:33:04,160 --> 00:33:07,260
There are too many to choose from

583
00:33:07,270 --> 00:33:08,770
So cute

584
00:33:08,770 --> 00:33:10,690
So disgusting

585
00:33:10,970 --> 00:33:12,240
Like this?

586
00:33:12,570 --> 00:33:14,170
Will it go in?

587
00:33:14,170 --> 00:33:15,670
Open your mouth

588
00:33:15,640 --> 00:33:19,200
It's too big!

589
00:33:17,640 --> 00:33:19,800
It's all in~

590
00:33:19,800 --> 00:33:21,800
Amazing!

591
00:33:21,800 --> 00:33:23,470
Disgusting, disgusting

592
00:33:23,470 --> 00:33:24,800
Disgusting

593
00:33:26,780 --> 00:33:27,880
Open your mouth, open your mouth, open your mouth

594
00:33:32,680 --> 00:33:34,540
His eyes are shining!

595
00:33:37,260 --> 00:33:40,660
I can't see it at all. Open wider, copy me!

596
00:33:43,770 --> 00:33:44,770
I see a little bit of it

597
00:33:44,770 --> 00:33:46,700
Wait, I'll return the gift, i'll return the gift

598
00:33:47,030 --> 00:33:48,120
Do you need to do it too?

599
00:33:49,040 --> 00:33:49,930
Here

600
00:33:49,630 --> 00:33:50,860
What?

601
00:33:52,910 --> 00:33:55,350
Foreign objects mixed in

602
00:33:54,610 --> 00:33:56,960
What does "foreign matter mixed in" mean?

603
00:34:00,350 --> 00:34:04,260
Not visible at all
-Not visible

604
00:34:11,930 --> 00:34:13,200
What is this image?

605
00:34:22,470 --> 00:34:24,190
I'm super excited

606
00:34:24,470 --> 00:34:26,080
The climax is coming

607
00:34:26,080 --> 00:34:28,910
The pinnacle, this is the pinnacle

608
00:34:28,910 --> 00:34:31,310
Showing me her mouth

609
00:34:31,780 --> 00:34:33,350
I saw what others usually don't

610
00:34:33,710 --> 00:34:35,610
This person is hopeless

611
00:34:33,720 --> 00:34:38,120
So, I exploded with happiness

612
00:34:38,120 --> 00:34:40,060
The mouth is superb

613
00:34:41,090 --> 00:34:46,260
I really like this kind of mutual thing

614
00:34:46,260 --> 00:34:48,000
I'm really amazed

615
00:34:48,000 --> 00:34:51,670
So disgusting. Is he serious?

616
00:34:53,700 --> 00:34:56,540
In my heart, I just felt "ugh!"

617
00:34:56,540 --> 00:35:01,010
a 40 year-old doing this sort of thing

618
00:35:03,010 --> 00:35:05,720
It's really disgusting to me

619
00:35:05,720 --> 00:35:09,920
Who wants to see inside the mouth of some old dude?

620
00:35:09,920 --> 00:35:13,060
Cheers!

621
00:35:14,490 --> 00:35:16,640
Worry about your status

622
00:35:16,640 --> 00:35:18,360
Worry

623
00:35:22,270 --> 00:35:23,960
There are fake ones among them

624
00:35:23,930 --> 00:35:26,980
I might've drunk too much today

625
00:35:29,640 --> 00:35:37,160
Next, Kuro-chan chatted with the girls individually in order

626
00:35:37,580 --> 00:35:40,480
I am a dental assistant by profession

627
00:35:40,480 --> 00:35:43,180
So although I really like Kuro-chan

628
00:35:43,180 --> 00:35:48,170
I still think its important to pay attention to the taste of your mouth and the alignment of your teeth.
-Yes yes yes

629
00:35:48,790 --> 00:35:51,030
Yes, from a professional point of view.
-It's something I focus on

630
00:35:51,930 --> 00:35:53,860
Can you help me check the taste of my mouth?

631
00:35:54,030 --> 00:35:56,240
Breathe for me.
-Is that okay?

632
00:35:58,260 --> 00:35:58,970
It's gotta stink

633
00:35:58,970 --> 00:36:01,800
No smell at all

634
00:36:00,430 --> 00:36:01,900
It stinks! It stinks!

635
00:36:01,800 --> 00:36:03,510
Just a few fillings

636
00:36:04,370 --> 00:36:06,680
It was seen, really

637
00:36:06,670 --> 00:36:09,400
There's a few caps, but they're fine

638
00:36:09,380 --> 00:36:12,810
It's totally acceptable for me to fall in love

639
00:36:09,400 --> 00:36:10,750
This girl is so skilled

640
00:36:13,280 --> 00:36:20,220
I was so happy that you didn't duck when I breathed

641
00:36:19,720 --> 00:36:21,380
Good talker

642
00:36:20,220 --> 00:36:23,110
I don't dislike you at all

643
00:36:23,110 --> 00:36:29,070
To confirm, is that the first time you showed someone the food in your mouth?

644
00:36:29,170 --> 00:36:31,630
First time in my life

645
00:36:31,630 --> 00:36:32,640
Definitely the first time

646
00:36:32,640 --> 00:36:33,940
What a stupid question

647
00:36:34,640 --> 00:36:38,040
Sorry, but that's what fetishes are for

648
00:36:38,040 --> 00:36:41,320
If its for the person I like then its fine

649
00:36:42,080 --> 00:36:45,750
It's amazing, it's really amazing, seriously

650
00:36:45,760 --> 00:36:46,660
What the hell?

651
00:36:45,920 --> 00:36:48,220
Oh no, seriously!

652
00:36:51,020 --> 00:36:53,280
Ri, I like you

653
00:36:53,280 --> 00:36:54,520
A confession!

654
00:36:53,490 --> 00:36:55,360
I'm happy to hear it

655
00:36:55,350 --> 00:36:57,070
Everyone will hear the same thing

656
00:36:55,360 --> 00:37:00,100
Sorry, I'm too happy so I got drunk

657
00:37:00,260 --> 00:37:04,170
When I heard about this project, I thought

658
00:37:04,170 --> 00:37:11,170
Once I'm in a relationship, I won't stop at just dating

659
00:37:12,220 --> 00:37:13,480
What are you talking about?

660
00:37:13,010 --> 00:37:15,240
I'm thinking about marriage
-Yes

661
00:37:15,410 --> 00:37:18,710
I also want to get married to Kuro-chan

662
00:37:20,350 --> 00:37:22,600
Too fast, right?

663
00:37:21,320 --> 00:37:26,660
No, wait, how? I seem to have an answer...

664
00:37:27,440 --> 00:37:28,360
So quick!

665
00:37:28,360 --> 00:37:31,280
Miku, what type of girl are you?

666
00:37:32,430 --> 00:37:39,340
You know, the color of your hair, what is this style?

667
00:37:39,340 --> 00:37:41,820
Normally it wouldn't be so done up

668
00:37:41,820 --> 00:37:44,540
But I heard you like pink

669
00:37:44,540 --> 00:37:46,710
I dyed it pink, but the color kind of disappeared

670
00:37:47,770 --> 00:37:52,650
Was the change made for me?

671
00:37:53,920 --> 00:37:56,590
I came here to marry you

672
00:37:57,330 --> 00:37:58,950
Is there such a person?

673
00:37:58,150 --> 00:38:03,530
Ah~, Mi, I'm going to protect you

674
00:38:03,520 --> 00:38:04,600
I'm protecting you now

675
00:38:07,000 --> 00:38:09,470
I hope you will protect me

676
00:38:07,680 --> 00:38:09,450
What the hell?

677
00:38:09,700 --> 00:38:13,800
How... how should I put it...

678
00:38:13,800 --> 00:38:16,410
It's like, "this might be love"

679
00:38:15,960 --> 00:38:17,260
So annoying

680
00:38:17,610 --> 00:38:18,520
After this also

681
00:38:19,580 --> 00:38:24,490
I have 24-hour surveillance at home, do you mind?

682
00:38:24,710 --> 00:38:27,580
Do not care at all, let them look

683
00:38:27,580 --> 00:38:29,300
Let them watch us fool around

684
00:38:30,020 --> 00:38:38,630
The one-on-one chats with Kuro-chan to find a new girlfriend after a long absence of 10 years

685
00:38:38,640 --> 00:38:40,560
I hope you can teach me a lot of things

686
00:38:40,660 --> 00:38:42,410
What do you want me to teach you?

687
00:38:42,410 --> 00:38:43,730
What do you want me to teach you?

688
00:38:43,730 --> 00:38:45,540
You asked me to teach you

689
00:38:45,770 --> 00:38:47,800
I didn't say it

690
00:38:47,040 --> 00:38:49,040
So close!

691
00:38:49,810 --> 00:38:54,380
Talking to me so closely, I really felt sick

692
00:38:53,300 --> 00:38:55,560
This is someone's real feelings

693
00:38:54,910 --> 00:39:00,980
He really thinks of himself as a handsome man, really stupid

694
00:39:05,230 --> 00:39:09,890
Now Kuro-chan must announce the first batch of unsuccessful hopefuls

695
00:39:09,890 --> 00:39:14,930
2 of 9 will be eliminated

696
00:39:15,430 --> 00:39:20,320
It's about time. How are you feeling, Kuro-chan?

697
00:39:20,320 --> 00:39:27,940
I'm torn, but after talking to everyone fully, I have a firm answer

698
00:39:28,510 --> 00:39:35,400
So, Kuro-chan, please tap the shoulders of the girls you would like to stay

699
00:39:48,260 --> 00:39:49,530
Qualified

700
00:39:49,830 --> 00:39:51,400
Thank you

701
00:39:51,400 --> 00:39:52,580
Thank you

702
00:39:52,580 --> 00:39:53,280
Crying!

703
00:39:53,280 --> 00:39:54,980
So happy?

704
00:39:54,980 --> 00:39:56,430
Tears of joy?

705
00:39:56,430 --> 00:39:58,440
I don't know, what if it's an act?

706
00:40:04,280 --> 00:40:07,090
Next, please select the second person

707
00:40:07,090 --> 00:40:09,470
Kuro-chan, please make your choice

708
00:40:13,070 --> 00:40:15,430
Looked inside her mouth after all

709
00:40:15,430 --> 00:40:16,290
Likes this girl

710
00:40:16,060 --> 00:40:16,960
Qualified

711
00:40:17,130 --> 00:40:19,060
Thank you

712
00:40:26,210 --> 00:40:27,120
Afterwards

713
00:40:29,740 --> 00:40:30,520
Thank you

714
00:40:30,520 --> 00:40:32,000
Thank you

715
00:40:35,180 --> 00:40:37,610
Thank you

716
00:40:39,780 --> 00:40:41,510
Qualified
-Thank you

717
00:40:45,150 --> 00:40:45,920
Qualified

718
00:40:46,860 --> 00:40:50,120
Finally these three remain

719
00:40:50,120 --> 00:40:56,070
Kuro-chan, please select the last person

720
00:40:55,480 --> 00:40:56,880
Eliminating 2 people

721
00:40:56,070 --> 00:40:57,630
OK

722
00:41:02,840 --> 00:41:04,260
Not nervous at all

723
00:41:09,480 --> 00:41:14,320
Mami, you've passed. Congratulations.
-Thanks

724
00:41:22,690 --> 00:41:28,950
Above is Kuro-chan's ranking

725
00:41:28,950 --> 00:41:37,640
I feel that Mana and Momo genuinely liked me

726
00:41:38,120 --> 00:41:41,890
But they're not really my type

727
00:41:41,890 --> 00:41:45,250
So I eliminated them

728
00:41:45,550 --> 00:41:50,010
There's something I need to tell you.
-Something to tell me?

729
00:41:50,010 --> 00:41:55,990
In fact, not everyone here likes Kuro-chan

730
00:41:55,700 --> 00:41:56,820
See?
-It's true

731
00:41:56,820 --> 00:41:58,350
Now he knows

732
00:41:57,690 --> 00:42:00,430
Eh, what do you mean?

733
00:42:00,600 --> 00:42:03,760
Of course there are also some that like you

734
00:42:03,900 --> 00:42:08,270
But a few are just pretending to like you

735
00:42:08,270 --> 00:42:10,370
What? This is so not necessary!

736
00:42:10,390 --> 00:42:11,320
It is

737
00:42:13,240 --> 00:42:15,850
What'd be the point if they all like you?

738
00:42:15,850 --> 00:42:24,180
So, as some girls have been included to pretend to like him

739
00:42:24,790 --> 00:42:36,670
Can Kuro-chan find a girl who really likes him and get a girlfriend after 10 years?

740
00:42:37,070 --> 00:42:40,140
What is the purpose of this?

741
00:42:40,540 --> 00:42:46,310
So, what about the 2 people eliminated today?

742
00:42:46,310 --> 00:42:49,960
Which side are those 2 people on?

743
00:42:50,150 --> 00:42:53,780
They were both pretending

744
00:42:54,980 --> 00:42:56,950
No way, absolutely no way!

745
00:42:56,950 --> 00:42:59,290
It can't be true, seriously!

746
00:42:59,820 --> 00:43:02,030
That's awful

747
00:43:02,030 --> 00:43:04,230
I was lying, sorry

748
00:43:04,430 --> 00:43:09,190
Pretending to like Kuro-chan is a bit too tiring

749
00:43:09,330 --> 00:43:12,480
To be honest there is nothing that I like about him

750
00:43:12,480 --> 00:43:13,830
Understandable

751
00:43:13,100 --> 00:43:14,500
Really?
-Really

752
00:43:14,600 --> 00:43:17,070
Wait a minute

753
00:43:17,070 --> 00:43:19,240
Women are scary

754
00:43:18,280 --> 00:43:19,400
He was fooled

755
00:43:19,400 --> 00:43:25,820
I felt so guilty after eliminating them because I really thought they liked me

756
00:43:25,820 --> 00:43:27,980
So that means you can't tell

757
00:43:28,250 --> 00:43:30,850
Wait

758
00:43:31,490 --> 00:43:36,130
If those 2 people are fake...

759
00:43:36,130 --> 00:43:37,760
It feels like everyone is fake now

760
00:43:40,080 --> 00:43:41,480
Seriously?

761
00:43:43,000 --> 00:43:44,490
What is this line?

762
00:43:44,490 --> 00:43:50,010
Now, the remaining members will start living with Kuro-chan

763
00:43:50,010 --> 00:43:53,180
The setting is once again Okinawa

764
00:43:55,380 --> 00:43:56,790
Cheers!

765
00:43:57,690 --> 00:43:59,920
I am trying to get married!

766
00:43:59,920 --> 00:44:01,800
I'm not playing around

767
00:44:01,800 --> 00:44:02,690
Can I kiss you?

768
00:44:02,690 --> 00:44:04,390
I hope you only like me

769
00:44:05,620 --> 00:44:08,420
I like you the most!

770
00:44:08,240 --> 00:44:09,550
What the hell?

771
00:44:09,890 --> 00:44:14,900
I don't trust the girl who likes me

772
00:44:18,190 --> 00:44:20,370
What?

773
00:44:20,370 --> 00:44:24,640
What's up with this secrecy?

774
00:44:24,640 --> 00:44:27,720
This is not a simple love project at all!

775
00:44:27,720 --> 00:44:32,080
That's for sure.
-Not everyone wants to make good memories with that lowly man

776
00:44:32,080 --> 00:44:35,620
We don't know how many are sincere
-Correct

777
00:44:35,620 --> 00:44:39,070
There are a few people who are lying, but we don't know who
-Yeah

778
00:44:40,020 --> 00:44:43,390
But 3rd place Risa is lying, right?

779
00:44:43,390 --> 00:44:45,440
Risa?

780
00:44:45,440 --> 00:44:48,960
After all, its impossible to believe that Kuro-chan's mouth doesn't stink

781
00:44:48,960 --> 00:44:51,370
Who knows? I've never smelled it either

782
00:44:51,370 --> 00:44:53,510
It stinks

783
00:44:53,510 --> 00:44:54,840
It definitely stinks, doesn't it?
-It stinks

784
00:44:55,690 --> 00:44:56,670
You haven't smelled it either

785
00:44:56,670 --> 00:44:57,940
It just stinks

786
00:44:57,940 --> 00:44:59,680
It can't stink 24 hours a day

787
00:44:59,680 --> 00:45:03,450
I don't know why i'm sticking up for Kuro-chan

788
00:45:03,550 --> 00:45:10,760
Are they crying because they're happy or because they want out?
-Yes, yes, yes

789
00:45:10,760 --> 00:45:13,950
It could be either

790
00:45:13,950 --> 00:45:16,290
It's unclear what the tears are expressing

791
00:45:16,290 --> 00:45:19,700
Maybe it's acting, maybe it's true

792
00:45:19,700 --> 00:45:20,800
It's scary

793
00:45:20,800 --> 00:45:24,100
Michopa you can't stand him, but you're also curious, right?
-No, no, no.

794
00:45:24,100 --> 00:45:26,040
To see what'll happen

795
00:45:26,040 --> 00:45:28,340
I don't care about his love life at all

796
00:45:29,040 --> 00:45:32,300
I just want him to be cheated

797
00:45:32,300 --> 00:45:36,200
Kuro-chan looks happy right now

798
00:45:36,200 --> 00:45:37,480
But also a little suspicious

799
00:45:37,610 --> 00:45:41,330
I hope the program team quickly torture him to death

800
00:45:41,330 --> 00:45:42,920
That's too much!

801
00:45:42,920 --> 00:46:15,020
