00:00:03,720 --> 00:00:04,780
Good morning!

7
00:00:08,550 --> 00:00:10,720
Do you mind if I ask you something?

8
00:00:09,590 --> 00:00:10,720
What?

9
00:00:12,590 --> 00:00:15,130

10
00:00:12,590 --> 00:00:15,130
Feburary 15th is?

11
00:00:15,130 --> 00:00:18,460
It's your birthday

12
00:00:16,760 --> 00:00:18,460
That's right...

13
00:00:19,660 --> 00:00:20,430
Thank you!

14
00:00:20,430 --> 00:00:22,600
I didn't think you would answer it so quickly

15
00:00:22,600 --> 00:00:26,670
You thought we were gonna say something off?

16
00:00:24,340 --> 00:00:26,670
I expected you to get it wrong then I'd yell!

17
00:00:26,670 --> 00:00:28,270
No it's enough

18
00:00:28,270 --> 00:00:29,140
Its enough?

19
00:00:29,140 --> 00:00:31,540
Oh, It's your birthday?

20
00:00:30,080 --> 00:00:31,540
That's right

21
00:00:31,540 --> 00:00:36,210
"Oh it's your birthday" you say...

22
00:00:31,540 --> 00:00:36,210
Even though we've been working together for 25 years

23
00:00:36,210 --> 00:00:37,350
How old are you going to be?

24
00:00:37,350 --> 00:00:42,650
I'll be properly 47 years old

25
00:00:39,120 --> 00:00:42,650
What the hell is "properly"?

26
00:00:42,650 --> 00:00:44,860
Do you remember it Hamada?

27
00:00:44,460 --> 00:00:44,860
Remember what?

28
00:00:44,860 --> 00:00:49,330
When it was your birthday

29
00:00:46,830 --> 00:00:49,330
Everyone came and brought letters

30
00:00:49,330 --> 00:00:53,600
It was an amazing storm of emotions

31
00:00:51,660 --> 00:00:53,600
A storm of emotions?

32
00:00:54,300 --> 00:00:57,170
At the bar

33
00:00:55,130 --> 00:00:57,170
Yes that's right!

34
00:00:57,170 --> 00:01:01,410
Honestly, I really don't want to remember it

35
00:01:02,410 --> 00:01:20,160

For Hamada's 50th birthday

39
00:01:06,910 --> 00:01:11,120
An emotional unlike Gaki no Tsukai surprise

40
00:01:12,420 --> 00:01:17,590
Putting away comedy, The crew prepares emotional letters

41
00:01:17,760 --> 00:01:20,530
I was able to make a living as a comedian

42
00:01:23,330 --> 00:01:29,130
With that Housei's plan for this episode

43
00:01:29,630 --> 00:01:31,540
Watching that episode

44
00:01:31,540 --> 00:01:37,110
My wife

45
00:01:32,470 --> 00:01:37,110
's impression of you skyrocketed

46
00:01:35,470 --> 00:01:37,110
Oh is that so?

47
00:01:37,110 --> 00:01:40,780
I

48
00:01:37,980 --> 00:01:40,780
want to do that as well

49
00:01:40,110 --> 00:01:40,780
What do you mean?

50
00:01:40,780 --> 00:01:42,110
Well It's my birthday

51
00:01:42,110 --> 00:01:49,820
From everyone...

52
00:01:43,880 --> 00:01:49,820
Your feelings of thanks

53
00:01:45,320 --> 00:01:49,820
Put them into a letter and

54
00:01:48,320 --> 00:01:49,820
For Yamachan

55
00:01:49,820 --> 00:01:54,190
Alright!

56
00:01:50,160 --> 00:01:54,190
Enough!

57
00:01:50,720 --> 00:01:54,190
I'm going!

58
00:01:54,190 --> 00:01:58,160
Your seriously terrible!

59
00:02:00,330 --> 00:02:04,140
You crushed Yamachan!

60
00:02:04,140 --> 00:02:05,840
We're close enough

61
00:02:05,840 --> 00:02:08,870
Let's get even closer!

62
00:02:08,870 --> 00:02:12,110
It's pretty inconsiderate to push us closer

63
00:02:16,410 --> 00:02:18,250
Sorry but I want to do it!

64
00:02:18,250 --> 00:02:19,080
To me...

65
00:02:19,080 --> 00:02:20,150
So it's for you?

66
00:02:20,150 --> 00:02:23,790
I'll be playing Hamada's role

67
00:02:23,790 --> 00:02:27,660
And everyone will read their Thank-you letter's

68
00:02:25,960 --> 00:02:27,660
Well when you say "Thank-you letter"...

69
00:02:29,730 --> 00:02:34,570
Well I don't know if we can call it a "surprise"

70
00:02:30,460 --> 00:02:31,700
Your right

71
00:02:32,530 --> 00:02:34,570
You didn't know about it right Hamada?

72
00:02:34,570 --> 00:02:36,500
Well If you really think about it

73
00:02:36,500 --> 00:02:40,440
Do you have some thanks for me?

74
00:02:36,500 --> 00:02:40,440
How about it Tanaka

75
00:02:40,440 --> 00:02:46,910
When it comes to a letter...

76
00:02:42,770 --> 00:02:46,910
especially this soon....

77
00:02:46,910 --> 00:02:50,080
I can't exactly give thanks to myself

78
00:02:50,080 --> 00:02:51,650
This is a blunt story

79
00:02:51,650 --> 00:02:55,120
Well wheres the meaning in doing this episode?

80
00:02:55,120 --> 00:02:58,620
That's why I prepared for this in advanced

81
00:02:57,720 --> 00:02:58,620
So weird...

82
00:02:59,290 --> 00:03:02,790
These are (fake) letter's for me

83
00:03:00,930 --> 00:03:02,790
This one's yours Hamada

84
00:03:02,790 --> 00:03:07,330
These (Lie)"Thank-you" letters

85
00:03:04,030 --> 00:03:07,330
I wrote them

86
00:03:10,200 --> 00:03:13,970
I'll be like Hamada

87
00:03:12,070 --> 00:03:13,970
The bar lady

88
00:03:13,970 --> 00:03:21,910
Then you come sort of drunk

89
00:03:15,840 --> 00:03:21,910
Enter the bar

90
00:03:17,340 --> 00:03:21,910
and read!

91
00:03:22,250 --> 00:03:26,380
I want to feel moved

92
00:03:28,350 --> 00:03:30,620
So do you want use to be serious when we read it?

93
00:03:30,620 --> 00:03:31,960
You should definitely be serious when you read it

94
00:03:31,960 --> 00:03:34,130
Maybe some tears too

95
00:03:33,120 --> 00:03:34,130
from you guys

96
00:03:34,130 --> 00:03:36,960
I'm trusting you with this

97
00:03:36,960 --> 00:03:39,460
This is pretty excessive

98
00:03:39,460 --> 00:03:40,800
I'll be waiting

99
00:03:40,800 --> 00:03:44,200
So it's only us that are doing it?

100
00:03:42,330 --> 00:03:44,200
Well, you know...

101
00:03:44,200 --> 00:03:49,410
It's pretty unreliable

102
00:03:45,470 --> 00:03:49,410
If you four do it

103
00:03:46,200 --> 00:03:49,410
He's speaking like hes above us

104
00:03:49,410 --> 00:03:52,740
I've invited some people but you'll find out who

105
00:03:52,740 --> 00:03:53,350
See ya in a bit

106
00:03:53,350 --> 00:03:55,380
I guess we have to get ready

107
00:03:55,380 --> 00:03:58,150
Are we going to have a rehearsal first?

108
00:03:56,950 --> 00:03:58,150
No, there will be no rehearsal

109
00:03:58,150 --> 00:03:59,580
I want this to have no preparation

110
00:03:59,580 --> 00:04:02,690
That way it'll be really moving

111
00:04:02,690 --> 00:04:06,590
Make sure you guy's are ready to do this

112
00:04:06,960 --> 00:04:08,660
Thank you!

113
00:04:09,530 --> 00:04:16,230

It's sort of like a game huh

128
00:04:45,200 --> 00:04:50,940
It's not a place just for drinking

129
00:04:46,870 --> 00:04:50,140
For a fun time right?

130
00:04:47,770 --> 00:04:50,940
Its a place to come for a fun time

131
00:04:50,940 --> 00:04:54,310
It's like a store to relieve the stress from customers huh

132
00:04:54,310 --> 00:04:55,610

00:05:14,530 --> 00:05:17,660
Haven't you drank enough?

141
00:05:16,060 --> 00:05:17,660
Sorry just a bit!

142
00:05:17,660 --> 00:05:19,660

00:05:36,920 --> 00:05:39,820

Well...

158
00:05:55,730 --> 00:06:02,540
For the most part

159
00:05:57,900 --> 00:06:02,540
It sure has gotten colder huh?

160
00:05:59,400 --> 00:06:00,510
Feburary and all

161
00:06:02,540 --> 00:06:05,140
Well It's probably the coldest time of the year

162
00:06:06,680 --> 00:06:12,580
When you hear about Feburary

163
00:06:08,750 --> 00:06:12,580
They usually say it's the coldest time and....

164
00:06:12,580 --> 00:06:14,890
Isn't it your birthday Housei?

165
00:06:14,890 --> 00:06:17,760
Feburary 15th

166
00:06:16,120 --> 00:06:17,760
Yes

00:06:16,590 --> 00:06:17,760
It's Mama

168
00:06:18,160 --> 00:06:20,690
It's Mama's birthday

169
00:06:20,830 --> 00:06:22,290
Well you know

170
00:06:22,290 --> 00:06:26,660
Even if I do this thing

171
00:06:24,900 --> 00:06:26,660
I know your not going to want it but

172
00:06:26,660 --> 00:06:31,700
I've put

173
00:06:28,200 --> 00:06:31,700
all my feelings of gratitude towards you together and

174
00:06:33,870 --> 00:06:36,570
I wrote a letter

175
00:06:36,570 --> 00:06:38,740
No way...

176
00:06:38,740 --> 00:06:41,750
That's no good~

177
00:06:41,750 --> 00:06:44,750
I'm bad at these kind of things

178
00:06:45,220 --> 00:06:46,480
No way... No way

179
00:06:46,480 --> 00:06:48,790
Quit that!

180
00:06:50,560 --> 00:06:53,320
I know you don't want to hear it but...

181
00:06:53,320 --> 00:06:55,790
Well you know Tanka put all this effort into it and all

182
00:06:55,790 --> 00:06:57,530
He really thought it through

183
00:06:56,460 --> 00:06:57,530
Yes, I did

184
00:06:57,530 --> 00:07:00,370
Fine then... I guess...

185
00:07:00,370 --> 00:07:02,870
But seriously I'm bad at these kind of things

186
00:07:02,870 --> 00:07:05,700
Yes.. I know you are

187
00:07:06,070 --> 00:07:07,910
I'm sorry but my feelings up until now

188
00:07:07,910 --> 00:07:12,380
On these kind of occasions

189
00:07:09,470 --> 00:07:12,380
You don't do these sort of things

190
00:07:12,380 --> 00:07:13,550
I'm sorry but

191
00:07:13,550 --> 00:07:18,420
I mean doing it at this sort of place in the studio and all...

192
00:07:22,090 --> 00:07:25,120
Of course, I know its not my intention but

193
00:07:25,120 --> 00:07:30,060
I just really want to express my feelings

194
00:07:30,930 --> 00:07:32,930
Hurry up and read it then~

195
00:07:32,930 --> 00:07:36,840
Get to reading it already!

196
00:07:34,900 --> 00:07:36,840
Alright

197
00:07:39,800 --> 00:07:45,040
A letter of thanks to Housei

198
00:07:45,680 --> 00:07:47,210
To Housei

199
00:07:50,550 --> 00:07:59,390
I know

200
00:07:52,050 --> 00:07:59,390
for sure

201
00:07:53,150 --> 00:07:59,390
your surprised from this sudden letter but

202
00:07:55,320 --> 00:07:59,390
Please just listen to it until the end

203
00:07:59,420 --> 00:08:04,130
Cocorico

204
00:08:01,230 --> 00:08:04,130
was made to do

205
00:08:02,090 --> 00:08:04,130
a Gaki no Tsukai warm-up and immediately

206
00:08:04,400 --> 00:08:11,440
Housei looked at me and said

207
00:08:05,830 --> 00:08:11,440
"Your

208
00:08:06,900 --> 00:08:11,440
like a skeleton!

209
00:08:08,000 --> 00:08:11,440
Are you eating?"

210
00:08:11,740 --> 00:08:20,140
I

211
00:08:13,040 --> 00:08:20,140
answered

212
00:08:14,840 --> 00:08:20,140
"Yes! I'm fine!" but

213
00:08:16,840 --> 00:08:20,140
The truth is at that time,

214
00:08:18,440 --> 00:08:20,140
I had a debt to a company

215
00:08:20,180 --> 00:08:27,590
Just making a living by itself

216
00:08:22,350 --> 00:08:27,590
Honestly,

217
00:08:23,720 --> 00:08:27,590
I had money problems

218
00:08:27,650 --> 00:08:37,460
Of course

219
00:08:28,550 --> 00:08:37,460
I couldn't eat properly because of it!

220
00:08:32,490 --> 00:08:37,460
The bento box I'd get

221
00:08:34,690 --> 00:08:37,460
was the best lunch all week

222
00:08:37,630 --> 00:08:46,910
But

223
00:08:39,060 --> 00:08:46,910
I didn't

224
00:08:40,530 --> 00:08:46,910
want Housei

225
00:08:42,430 --> 00:08:46,910
to notice that

226
00:08:43,700 --> 00:08:46,910
And so I acted

227
00:08:44,600 --> 00:08:46,910
as if I didn't have money problems

228
00:08:47,510 --> 00:08:57,480
However,

229
00:08:49,040 --> 00:08:57,480
Housei

230
00:08:50,480 --> 00:08:57,480
saw through it all

231
00:08:53,280 --> 00:08:57,480
"Because I don't have someone to talk to stick with me"

232
00:08:57,520 --> 00:09:03,520
It was just like Housei,

233
00:08:59,450 --> 00:09:03,520
to not force someone to fuss about it

234
00:09:01,550 --> 00:09:03,520
and with an kind and reasonable excuse

235
00:09:03,520 --> 00:09:07,160
He invited me out to eat

236
00:09:07,190 --> 00:09:13,160
For me at the time,

237
00:09:08,660 --> 00:09:13,160
after eating

238
00:09:10,800 --> 00:09:13,160
some top-quality food that I could never pay back

239
00:09:13,200 --> 00:09:18,840
Housei

240
00:09:14,300 --> 00:09:18,840
went to have a smoke and

241
00:09:16,230 --> 00:09:18,840
took out his pack of cigarettes

242
00:09:18,870 --> 00:09:29,950
Then Housei

243
00:09:22,310 --> 00:09:29,950
"Huh?

244
00:09:24,110 --> 00:09:29,950
It's not here.

245
00:09:25,610 --> 00:09:29,950
I don't have a lighter"

246
00:09:27,510 --> 00:09:29,950
said to himself

247
00:09:29,980 --> 00:09:36,850
So I said

248
00:09:31,720 --> 00:09:36,850
"Please use this!"

249
00:09:34,290 --> 00:09:36,850
and handed him a 100 yen lighter

250
00:09:36,920 --> 00:09:44,360
"Because I'm a heavy smoker I need a light!

251
00:09:41,290 --> 00:09:44,360
So sell this lighter to me!"

252
00:09:43,030 --> 00:09:44,360
He said...

253
00:09:44,400 --> 00:09:55,110
He put the 100 yen lighter in his pocket

254
00:09:47,000 --> 00:09:55,110
Then handed me a 10,000 yen note

255
00:09:55,140 --> 00:10:01,650
I said

256
00:09:56,910 --> 00:10:01,650
"No, I can't accept that"

257
00:10:01,650 --> 00:10:14,360
"Because I'm a star, my sense on how to use money is weird!"

258
00:10:07,550 --> 00:10:14,360
Forcibly, you made me accept the 10,000 yen

259
00:10:14,360 --> 00:10:20,130
For me who had no money at the time

260
00:10:16,290 --> 00:10:20,130
It was money I was truly grateful for

261
00:10:20,160 --> 00:10:28,310
After that, every time I'd go out

262
00:10:23,900 --> 00:10:28,310
to eat with Housei,

263
00:10:25,540 --> 00:10:28,310
You would always say how you had no lighter

264
00:10:28,340 --> 00:10:33,410
and like always you would

265
00:10:30,780 --> 00:10:33,410
give me money for the lighter

266
00:10:33,440 --> 00:10:41,420
I

267
00:10:34,610 --> 00:10:41,420
was so very,

268
00:10:36,480 --> 00:10:41,420
very happy from that kindness

269
00:10:38,620 --> 00:10:41,420
I couldn't help it

270
00:10:41,450 --> 00:10:47,290
But truthfully that money

271
00:10:44,090 --> 00:10:47,290
I only used it to buy 100 yen lighters

272
00:10:47,590 --> 00:10:52,900
The remaining 9,900 yen

273
00:10:49,760 --> 00:10:52,900
I saved it in my bank account

274
00:10:52,930 --> 00:11:00,670
All of that money you gave me

275
00:10:57,270 --> 00:11:00,670
I think of it as the price of your kindness

276
00:11:00,710 --> 00:11:04,510
And even now I am still saving it all

277
00:11:04,510 --> 00:11:07,780
Housei, You've found the wonderful job of Rakugo

278
00:11:07,780 --> 00:11:17,090
I love Housei's Rakugo

279
00:11:09,780 --> 00:11:17,090
because Housei's kindness

280
00:11:12,820 --> 00:11:17,090
always reveals itself

281
00:11:15,050 --> 00:11:17,050
From Cocorico Tanaka Naoki

282
00:11:20,290 --> 00:11:23,090
Quit it!

283
00:11:23,090 --> 00:11:25,260
It's so embarrassing!

284
00:11:28,300 --> 00:11:31,100
Something like this is only embarrassing!

285
00:11:32,040 --> 00:11:35,040
You saved it right?

286
00:11:41,650 --> 00:11:42,610
Sorry about that!

287
00:11:42,610 --> 00:11:45,980
No don't worry that was really....

288
00:11:45,980 --> 00:11:51,720
Even though I've known you for so long

289
00:11:48,150 --> 00:11:51,720
I didn't know about that story

290
00:11:53,860 --> 00:11:56,260
Let's drink and get happy!

291
00:11:56,460 --> 00:11:57,360
Lets do it!

292
00:11:57,360 --> 00:11:59,700
Let's get drunk!

293
00:11:58,230 --> 00:11:59,700
We're gonna get drunk huh?

294
00:11:59,700 --> 00:12:01,700
Cheers!

295
00:12:02,400 --> 00:12:04,800
Thank you

296
00:12:02,600 --> 00:12:04,640
Wow, I've never heard that before

297
00:12:05,300 --> 00:12:09,910
Thanks

298
00:12:06,800 --> 00:12:09,910
But I've never heard of that story before

299
00:12:13,310 --> 00:12:15,880
It was something Matsumoto didn't know about

300
00:12:17,220 --> 00:12:18,480
Good Evening!

301
00:12:18,680 --> 00:12:22,420
Cocorico

302
00:12:18,680 --> 00:12:22,420
Endo Shouzo

303
00:12:19,380 --> 00:12:20,480
Good evening!

304
00:12:22,650 --> 00:12:24,420
Enough already!

305
00:12:29,430 --> 00:12:31,430
So what do you want?

306
00:12:32,360 --> 00:12:33,630
Are you going to be drinking?

307
00:12:33,630 --> 00:12:34,970
Yea, Just a bit

308
00:12:34,970 --> 00:12:36,970
Look's like he's had a drink before

309
00:12:40,100 --> 00:12:42,710
Oolong...

310
00:12:42,710 --> 00:12:44,610
You've got some bad eyesight huh

311
00:12:43,780 --> 00:12:44,610
It seem's that way yes

312
00:12:46,610 --> 00:12:50,280
I'm already 43 after all!

313
00:12:53,350 --> 00:12:55,350
Sorry, Cheers!

314
00:12:57,190 --> 00:13:00,590
I want this place to become a lot more livelier and happier

315
00:13:00,590 --> 00:13:05,560
I mean before Endo came

316
00:13:02,090 --> 00:13:05,560
It was a pretty dreary atmosphere in here

317
00:13:05,800 --> 00:13:07,560
Alright let's make it fun

318
00:13:07,870 --> 00:13:09,870
Let's get happy!

319
00:13:12,640 --> 00:13:18,210
Seeing as it's this occasion and all

320
00:13:15,040 --> 00:13:18,210
I thought I could just borrow a bit of your time

321
00:13:16,940 --> 00:13:18,210
Enough already!

322
00:13:18,210 --> 00:13:20,210
Don't pull it out!

323
00:13:20,210 --> 00:13:22,210
Your pulling it out like it's a trump card!

324
00:13:24,980 --> 00:13:35,560
Up until now

325
00:13:27,450 --> 00:13:35,560
I haven't expressed my thanks to you

326
00:13:29,850 --> 00:13:35,560
So I guess you could call this a letter of thanks

327
00:13:32,590 --> 00:13:35,560
Quit it already!

328
00:13:35,560 --> 00:13:39,200
Your really gonna give me thanks?

329
00:13:41,470 --> 00:13:44,540
Close it already! I don't wanna hear this

330
00:13:46,140 --> 00:13:50,910
A letter of thanks to Housei from the heart

331
00:13:51,640 --> 00:13:53,640
To Housei

332
00:13:56,110 --> 00:13:58,950
It was 19 year's ago that Housei and I met

333
00:13:58,950 --> 00:14:06,390
Properly expressing my feelings of thanks

334
00:14:02,250 --> 00:14:06,390
I think this is my first time

335
00:14:06,420 --> 00:14:12,960
For Housei

336
00:14:08,290 --> 00:14:12,960
who I've been indebted to on many occasions

337
00:14:10,530 --> 00:14:12,960
I have a lot of thanks to give to him but

338
00:14:13,000 --> 00:14:18,170
Today, I think I want to

339
00:14:15,030 --> 00:14:18,170
talk about the event I'm most thankful for

340
00:14:18,170 --> 00:14:24,610
This is

341
00:14:19,500 --> 00:14:24,610
a secret only we know

342
00:14:21,240 --> 00:14:24,610
And something I'm forbidden by Housei to speak of but

343
00:14:24,840 --> 00:14:35,950
The truth is

344
00:14:27,450 --> 00:14:35,950
the start of my Ex-wife Chiaki and my relationship

345
00:14:31,280 --> 00:14:35,950
Chiaki

346
00:14:31,480 --> 00:14:35,950
Housei played a big role in that

347
00:14:35,950 --> 00:14:47,970
What I'm trying to say is that,

348
00:14:38,520 --> 00:14:47,970
Chiaki in the beginning

349
00:14:43,090 --> 00:14:47,970
Wasn't me but Housei

350
00:14:52,540 --> 00:14:58,610
She was in love with you

351
00:14:58,640 --> 00:15:02,510
For you,

352
00:15:00,540 --> 00:15:02,510
Those feelings

353
00:15:05,820 --> 00:15:07,650
I'm just remembering it all

354
00:15:10,960 --> 00:15:15,290
However you did not show any interest in her but

355
00:15:15,390 --> 00:15:28,170
Chiaki

356
00:15:18,400 --> 00:15:28,170
who chased after you

357
00:15:21,500 --> 00:15:28,170
would show up during your dinners every week

358
00:15:28,270 --> 00:15:34,810
And

359
00:15:29,870 --> 00:15:34,810
I, who was always sitting there

360
00:15:32,340 --> 00:15:34,810
After seeing her every time, before I knew it

361
00:15:34,850 --> 00:15:40,750
I fell in love with her

362
00:15:40,820 --> 00:15:48,830
One day, I

363
00:15:42,490 --> 00:15:48,830
prepared myself to get yelled at

364
00:15:44,760 --> 00:15:48,830
and went to talk to you about my feelings for her

365
00:15:48,830 --> 00:15:53,800
It was then you said

366
00:15:50,930 --> 00:15:53,800
"I understand"

367
00:15:52,300 --> 00:15:53,800
and left it at that

368
00:15:54,030 --> 00:16:01,040
The following day you set up

369
00:15:57,370 --> 00:16:01,040
a dinner for just her and me

370
00:16:01,070 --> 00:16:09,310
Thanks to that, I

371
00:16:02,470 --> 00:16:09,310
managed to get married to Chiaki

372
00:16:05,210 --> 00:16:09,310
While it was only temporary, I felt true happiness

373
00:16:10,180 --> 00:16:24,200
For sympathizing about my feelings that time

374
00:16:20,390 --> 00:16:24,200
Thank you from the bottom of my heart

375
00:16:24,230 --> 00:16:31,400
And there's one more thing

376
00:16:26,800 --> 00:16:31,400
When I talked to you about my worries as a comedian

377
00:16:31,440 --> 00:16:35,240
"Endou you have a really funny body so

378
00:16:33,240 --> 00:16:35,240
Why don't you just wear your boxers?"

379
00:16:35,310 --> 00:16:49,550
"Something like a

380
00:16:36,770 --> 00:16:49,550
"Hohhohoi"

381
00:16:42,710 --> 00:16:49,550
sound would be good".

382
00:16:46,880 --> 00:16:49,550
You gave me that advice

383
00:16:49,590 --> 00:16:54,330
And so that was the birth

384
00:16:51,160 --> 00:16:54,330
of what everybody know's as "Hohhoi"

385
00:16:54,660 --> 00:16:56,660
Housei's idea of "Hohhoi"

386
00:16:54,660 --> 00:17:00,300
Truthfully the parent of "Hohhoi"

387
00:16:57,900 --> 00:17:00,300
is in fact Housei

388
00:17:00,600 --> 00:17:05,940
But even about the Chiaki thing

389
00:17:03,030 --> 00:17:05,940
and the "Hohhoi".

390
00:17:04,800 --> 00:17:05,940
You never told anyone

391
00:17:05,970 --> 00:17:15,180
You allowed me, Endo Shouzo, to stand as a man

392
00:17:10,240 --> 00:17:15,180
I am truly grateful for that

393
00:17:15,710 --> 00:17:19,780
Housei, You've found the wonderful job of Rakugo

394
00:17:19,980 --> 00:17:27,430
I really love

395
00:17:21,320 --> 00:17:27,430
your carefree and fun Rakugo most of all

396
00:17:25,260 --> 00:17:27,260
Sorry, I was really nervous

397
00:17:27,890 --> 00:17:31,560
You said it...

398
00:17:31,560 --> 00:17:36,270
You really said it huh

399
00:17:36,270 --> 00:17:38,370
Well... This is....

400
00:17:38,370 --> 00:17:41,570
Another thing I have never heard of before

401
00:17:43,170 --> 00:17:48,450
Even though I told you I was taking it to my grave

402
00:17:48,450 --> 00:17:52,050
Thanks

403
00:17:53,480 --> 00:17:58,090
Thank you

404
00:18:01,390 --> 00:18:04,530
I didn't hear about this

405
00:18:04,530 --> 00:18:06,600
Did you know about it Tanaka?

406
00:18:05,460 --> 00:18:06,600
I had no idea

407
00:18:06,600 --> 00:18:08,970
What did you think when he was saying it

408
00:18:12,170 --> 00:18:14,870
I was thinking "Seriously!?"

409
00:18:15,740 --> 00:18:17,370
I never heard about it though

410
00:18:17,370 --> 00:18:21,050
It was pretty surprising huh!

411
00:18:21,050 --> 00:18:23,850
It really was surprising

412
00:18:21,150 --> 00:18:23,850
After this, Hamada's letter of thanks

413
00:18:25,720 --> 00:18:26,880
Good evening

414
00:18:26,920 --> 00:18:29,590
Downtown

415
00:18:26,920 --> 00:18:29,590
Hamada Masatoshi

416
00:18:29,590 --> 00:18:31,890
Welcome!

417
00:18:32,720 --> 00:18:34,530
You brought something with you huh?

418
00:18:34,530 --> 00:18:39,060
A letter

419
00:18:35,490 --> 00:18:39,060
to Yamachan

420
00:18:39,400 --> 00:18:40,700
Enough with that

421
00:18:40,700 --> 00:18:46,070
It's fine Hamada... I've had enough of that

422
00:18:42,770 --> 00:18:46,070
It's your birthday right?

423
00:18:44,030 --> 00:18:45,200
It is but

424
00:18:45,200 --> 00:18:46,070
So just listen

425
00:18:46,800 --> 00:18:47,770
Yeah but

426
00:18:47,770 --> 00:18:51,340
It's kind of gotten gloomy after those two read their letters you know?

427
00:18:51,340 --> 00:18:55,980
Everyone's doing things you wouldn't call normal huh

428
00:18:55,980 --> 00:18:58,450
We have to change the atmosphere!

429
00:18:58,450 --> 00:19:00,320
I'm really bad with this atmosphere seriously!

430
00:19:00,320 --> 00:19:04,220
Change this atmosphere!

431
00:19:01,750 --> 00:19:04,220
Of course we will

432
00:19:04,220 --> 00:19:07,190
Eh, Hamada giving me thanks

433
00:19:07,190 --> 00:19:13,260
That's bad I'm telling you

434
00:19:11,300 --> 00:19:13,260
What are you doing?

435
00:19:14,430 --> 00:19:19,670
A letter of thanks to the dear Housei

436
00:19:22,040 --> 00:19:23,310
To Yamachan

437
00:19:25,080 --> 00:19:25,710
Seriously...

438
00:19:26,210 --> 00:19:34,220
While we don't hang out with each other privately

439
00:19:30,710 --> 00:19:34,220
And we don't really see each other outside of work

440
00:19:34,420 --> 00:19:39,560
The truth is I'm very grateful to you about something

441
00:19:39,590 --> 00:19:47,800
It was a time before DownTown moved to Tokyo...

442
00:19:44,430 --> 00:19:47,800
While we were on break in Osaka

443
00:19:47,830 --> 00:19:54,270
It was then

444
00:19:49,770 --> 00:19:54,270
Suga and the others 27 year's ago approached us

445
00:19:54,770 --> 00:20:00,610
We were asked "Don't you want to have your own program in Tokyo"

446
00:20:01,150 --> 00:20:08,550
Of course, We were extremely overjoyed as it would be

447
00:20:04,920 --> 00:20:08,550
a first step in becoming national stars

448
00:20:08,750 --> 00:20:14,290
Truthfully there was one thing that was holding me back

449
00:20:14,430 --> 00:20:24,900
It was

450
00:20:22,570 --> 00:20:24,900
Ivory smuggling

451
00:20:25,640 --> 00:20:34,580
Matsumoto doesn't know about it but

452
00:20:28,840 --> 00:20:34,580
At the time, I was smuggling Ivory from Africa

453
00:20:34,610 --> 00:20:44,490
I was selling it in huge amounts

454
00:20:38,420 --> 00:20:44,490
on the black-market

455
00:20:42,090 --> 00:20:44,490
It was easy money

456
00:20:45,320 --> 00:20:51,330
"If I go to Tokyo I won't be able to smuggle Ivory!

457
00:20:49,530 --> 00:20:51,330
What do I do!"

458
00:20:51,360 --> 00:20:56,230
I was lost in thought

459
00:20:53,200 --> 00:20:56,230
Many days of being undecided had passed

460
00:20:56,270 --> 00:20:59,170
When I was depressed about that one day

461
00:20:59,200 --> 00:21:14,150
When I like usual,

462
00:21:04,440 --> 00:21:14,150
for an Ivory transaction

463
00:21:07,110 --> 00:21:14,150
went to Kobe Harbor in the middle of the night

464
00:21:14,150 --> 00:21:24,130
The one waiting for me there wasn't the broker

465
00:21:18,160 --> 00:21:24,130
But it was you, Yamachan

466
00:21:24,190 --> 00:21:30,630
Yamachan was different from usual

467
00:21:26,460 --> 00:21:30,630
Looking like a demon, you stared at me and said

468
00:21:31,040 --> 00:21:35,610
"Ivory or Downtown!

469
00:21:32,770 --> 00:21:35,610
Which one is more important!"

470
00:21:35,670 --> 00:21:43,650
Those words opened up my eyes

471
00:21:38,680 --> 00:21:43,650
and ever since

472
00:21:40,910 --> 00:21:43,650
I stopped handling Ivory

473
00:21:43,650 --> 00:21:45,920
We moved to Tokyo as Downtown

474
00:21:45,920 --> 00:21:50,850
And then we started this program

475
00:21:47,950 --> 00:21:50,850
"Gaki No Tsukai Ya Arahende"

476
00:21:51,020 --> 00:22:00,060
If you hadn't yelled those words from your heart at that time

477
00:21:53,820 --> 00:22:00,060
I would

478
00:21:56,830 --> 00:22:00,060
maybe still be doing ivory smuggling even now

479
00:22:00,100 --> 00:22:07,140
Downtown as it is now and Gaki no Tsuaki as it is now

480
00:22:03,070 --> 00:22:07,140
Is all thanks to you, Yamachan

481
00:22:07,170 --> 00:22:10,770
Yamachan, You've found the wonderful job of Rakugo

482
00:22:11,680 --> 00:22:17,610
One day, the Hamada family together

483
00:22:14,480 --> 00:22:17,610
Will go to see our beloved Yamachan's rakugo

484
00:22:18,420 --> 00:22:21,590
Thank you!

485
00:22:37,940 --> 00:22:41,840
Amazing story huh!

486
00:22:39,340 --> 00:22:41,840
Wasn't that an amazing story?

487
00:22:42,370 --> 00:22:43,740
Yea, I guess so

488
00:22:46,840 --> 00:22:49,480
Why'd you have to say it?

489
00:22:49,480 --> 00:22:52,950
I thought I told you it was a secret!

490
00:22:53,680 --> 00:22:56,090
That's terrible Hamada!

491
00:22:56,090 --> 00:22:59,760
Can you believe it Tanaka?

492
00:23:00,660 --> 00:23:02,130
"Seriously" I thought....

493
00:23:02,130 --> 00:23:03,560
"Amazing"

494
00:23:03,560 --> 00:23:07,160
What an amazing story it was

495
00:23:07,160 --> 00:23:10,000
About what Hamada did....

496
00:23:07,160 --> 00:23:10,000
What did you understand?

497
00:23:13,240 --> 00:23:15,910
You remembered it huh!

498
00:23:15,910 --> 00:23:20,340
Why are you getting so close to him?

499
00:23:22,780 --> 00:23:25,250
NEXT WEEK

500
00:23:25,280 --> 00:23:28,650
At that time my leg's started shaking uncontrollably...

501
00:23:29,420 --> 00:23:33,560
Matsumoto read's his letter of thanks to Housei

502
00:23:41,030 --> 00:23:44,840
And then a surprise guest will read their thanks as well

503
00:23:59,580 --> 00:24:03,250
The conclusion to the 6 reading their thank you letters!

504
00:24:03,550 --> 00:24:06,290
This isn't like Gaki No Tsukai at all huh!
