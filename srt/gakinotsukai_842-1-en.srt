11
00:00:06,420 --> 00:00:10,020

00:00:15,460 --> 00:00:17,300

He want's to do a new challenge huh.....

15
00:00:24,500 --> 00:00:26,380
Are you sure?

16
00:00:26,380 --> 00:00:29,260
I guess so....

17
00:00:29,740 --> 00:00:31,180
Oh Look!

18
00:00:34,580 --> 00:00:37,100
Yamazaki Housei

00:00:34,780 --> 00:00:37,100
He made a grand entrance huh

00:00:36,100 --> 00:00:37,100
Your right...

21
00:00:37,100 --> 00:00:38,260
Hello everybody!

22
00:00:38,260 --> 00:00:40,700
Hello!

23
00:00:40,700 --> 00:00:43,100
I'm the chairman Yamazaki Housei

24
00:00:43,460 --> 00:00:46,060
The reason I gathered you all this time

25
00:00:46,460 --> 00:00:48,460
In July 2007

26
00:00:48,460 --> 00:00:51,380
I'll be entering my 20th anniversary as a performer

27
00:00:51,380 --> 00:00:52,380
Ah I get it

28
00:00:52,380 --> 00:00:54,740
Now for something such as big as this

29
00:00:53,060 --> 00:00:56,620
If you squish it down...

30
00:00:54,020 --> 00:00:56,620
It could fit 2 years

31
00:00:54,740 --> 00:00:56,620
I thought "What haven't I done"

32
00:00:56,620 --> 00:00:59,940
For my anniversary I thought about what I haven't done

33
00:00:59,940 --> 00:01:02,340
And so I gathered you all here

34
00:01:02,940 --> 00:01:05,260
Something he hasn't done huh...

35
00:01:05,260 --> 00:01:08,300
For now because you guy's dont understand

36
00:01:08,300 --> 00:01:09,420
I will pass out the scripts

37
00:01:09,940 --> 00:01:11,620
He's pretty prepared for this

38
00:01:11,620 --> 00:01:13,540
He's completely ignoring us huh

39
00:01:13,540 --> 00:01:17,180
Please hand these out

40
00:01:17,180 --> 00:01:20,780
Yamano Ishimatsu's 100 Cut's!!

41
00:01:20,780 --> 00:01:22,780
This is pretty packed!

42
00:01:23,420 --> 00:01:24,780
What kind of picture is this?

43
00:01:26,140 --> 00:01:26,780
Uwa Look Matsumoto!

44
00:01:27,100 --> 00:01:30,020
So this is an acual thing?

45
00:01:30,020 --> 00:01:31,420
When you think of a 20th anniversary,

46
00:01:31,420 --> 00:01:35,540
This really is

47
00:01:32,100 --> 00:01:35,540
a big

48
00:01:32,620 --> 00:01:35,540
trns...

49
00:01:33,020 --> 00:01:35,540
turning point

50
00:01:33,780 --> 00:01:35,540
Huh!?

51
00:01:35,540 --> 00:01:36,900
When you say the word "Human"

52
00:01:36,900 --> 00:01:39,100
You think of a mature adult

53
00:01:39,100 --> 00:01:45,340
And So I want to do both together

54
00:01:39,100 --> 00:01:45,340
TL: Turning of age (20) and his 20th anniversary

55
00:01:39,820 --> 00:01:42,540
"When you say the word Human"

56
00:01:42,540 --> 00:01:45,340
Your also

57
00:01:43,540 --> 00:01:45,340
a human...

58
00:01:45,940 --> 00:01:47,140
This time!

59
00:01:47,140 --> 00:01:50,300
I will unprecedentedly

60
00:01:48,740 --> 00:01:50,300
Slay 100 people!

61
00:01:53,380 --> 00:01:55,100
Honestly...

62
00:01:55,100 --> 00:01:57,100
I think it's an amazing feat

63
00:01:57,180 --> 00:02:00,340
Use your nerves

64
00:01:58,980 --> 00:02:00,340
Use as much things as you can

65
00:02:00,500 --> 00:02:01,980
He said it

66
00:02:02,460 --> 00:02:03,540
Everyone!

67
00:02:03,540 --> 00:02:05,700
He said nothing but "Nerves"

68
00:02:04,660 --> 00:02:06,780
Please dont go about this half-assed

69
00:02:07,780 --> 00:02:10,060
Because your betting your life...

70
00:02:10,060 --> 00:02:11,500
Wait you!

71
00:02:13,220 --> 00:02:15,220
What are you holding right now?

72
00:02:15,220 --> 00:02:16,820
A sword

73
00:02:16,820 --> 00:02:18,740
So you know it's a sword!

74
00:02:20,100 --> 00:02:21,620
It's not a toy

75
00:02:21,620 --> 00:02:24,980
The sword

76
00:02:22,980 --> 00:02:24,980
your holding right now

77
00:02:23,180 --> 00:02:24,980
Is not a toy! Understand!?

78
00:02:24,980 --> 00:02:27,020
Think of it as a real sword!

79
00:02:27,380 --> 00:02:29,140
Sorry...

80
00:02:30,580 --> 00:02:31,820
I'm getting a little tired but

81
00:02:31,820 --> 00:02:33,820
It will become a big sword!

82
00:02:34,580 --> 00:02:36,300
He's using Kansai-ben now

83
00:02:36,300 --> 00:02:38,100
He was using a lot of Osaka-ben

84
00:02:39,060 --> 00:02:41,060
Sorry I'm here!

85
00:02:44,380 --> 00:02:46,980
They're late

86
00:02:45,500 --> 00:02:46,980
What's your excuse?

87
00:02:47,460 --> 00:02:48,260
Well.. Uh...

88
00:02:48,260 --> 00:02:50,700
We were at a Manga Cafe and we didn`t realize the time....

89
00:02:50,700 --> 00:02:53,180
A Manga Cafe?

90
00:02:53,180 --> 00:02:54,540
So what your telling me

91
00:02:54,540 --> 00:02:57,100
You knew it was Yamazaki Housei's 20th anniversary

92
00:02:57,100 --> 00:02:59,580
And you still went to a Manga Cafe?

93
00:03:00,580 --> 00:03:03,020
"You knew it"...

94
00:03:03,980 --> 00:03:05,220
Go home!

95
00:03:05,220 --> 00:03:06,100
GO HOME!

96
00:03:07,140 --> 00:03:09,140
WE'RE RISKING OUR LIVES HERE!

97
00:03:11,420 --> 00:03:14,100
GO HOME!

98
00:03:14,100 --> 00:03:16,060
We're really sorry!

99
00:03:18,100 --> 00:03:20,500
Will you take this seriously now?

100
00:03:20,740 --> 00:03:22,940
He forgave them huh

101
00:03:21,700 --> 00:03:23,700
That was quick

102
00:03:24,740 --> 00:03:26,540
All of you especially

103
00:03:26,860 --> 00:03:28,860
Because this is a 20th anniversary

104
00:03:30,140 --> 00:03:33,020
START TAKING ALL THIS SERIOUSLY!

105
00:03:33,340 --> 00:03:35,340
Please excuse us!

106
00:03:36,180 --> 00:03:38,700
YOUR ALL GOING TO RISK YOUR LIVES RIGHT!?

107
00:03:38,700 --> 00:03:40,700
YES!

108
00:03:42,180 --> 00:03:43,940
LET'S DO IT!

109
00:03:43,980 --> 00:03:45,220
THANK YOU!

110
00:03:45,220 --> 00:03:47,220
THANK  YOU!

111
00:03:47,380 --> 00:03:50,260
Ah Hes coming!

112
00:03:50,260 --> 00:03:52,260
Well....

113
00:03:52,260 --> 00:03:54,260
You made us wait for a while

114
00:03:55,820 --> 00:03:56,700
I guess so

115
00:03:58,500 --> 00:04:01,420
So is it alright if we just watch?

116
00:04:01,420 --> 00:04:02,900
No, Well...

117
00:04:02,900 --> 00:04:04,900
Your in the flyer

118
00:04:04,900 --> 00:04:05,460
Why?

119
00:04:05,460 --> 00:04:06,100
What?

120
00:04:06,100 --> 00:04:07,220
What is this?

121
00:04:07,660 --> 00:04:09,500
Why you ask?

122
00:04:09,500 --> 00:04:11,500
Your all entered in this

123
00:04:10,540 --> 00:04:12,620
Where did you get this picture?

124
00:04:12,620 --> 00:04:14,620
Look at the schedule as well!

125
00:04:16,860 --> 00:04:20,300
So your charging 800 yen for this huh

126
00:04:20,300 --> 00:04:22,300
Well naturally...

127
00:04:22,940 --> 00:04:24,940
Huh? The times are 1pm 3pm 5pm and 7pm!

128
00:04:24,940 --> 00:04:26,660
Your performing 4 times?

129
00:04:26,660 --> 00:04:28,660
That's some amazing stamina!

130
00:04:29,580 --> 00:04:32,020
Well then I guess I'll enter the 100 people

131
00:04:32,020 --> 00:04:37,900
But you've explained what happens when we get cut

132
00:04:37,900 --> 00:04:39,700
Well what do you want us to do if you get cut?

133
00:04:39,700 --> 00:04:41,180
Well I dont think I'm gonna get cut but

134
00:04:41,180 --> 00:04:45,420
If I get cut

135
00:04:42,460 --> 00:04:45,420
please put the count back

136
00:04:44,300 --> 00:04:45,420
What do you mean?

137
00:04:45,420 --> 00:04:49,020
Supposing I cut 50 people

138
00:04:49,020 --> 00:04:53,540
If I was cut it would go to 51, 52 ,53

139
00:04:53,540 --> 00:04:54,620
So it'd be like that

140
00:04:54,620 --> 00:04:57,420
So it would increase the count?

141
00:04:56,420 --> 00:04:57,420
Yes

142
00:04:57,420 --> 00:04:58,940
Are you really gonna cut 100 people?

143
00:04:58,940 --> 00:05:00,820
I'm going to cut 100 people!

144
00:05:00,980 --> 00:05:02,220
Alright Let's go!

145
00:05:02,220 --> 00:05:03,100

GET READY!

147
00:05:04,100 --> 00:05:05,220

00:08:04,620 --> 00:08:06,220
Yamazaki...

176
00:08:08,020 --> 00:08:09,740
You haven't cut 100 people yet...

177
00:08:09,740 --> 00:08:12,660
Are you coming?

178
00:08:12,660 --> 00:08:14,820

00:10:19,180 --> 00:10:22,420
Remaining

194
00:10:22,860 --> 00:10:28,100
10 minutes later

195
00:10:42,660 --> 00:10:43,820
Shut up!

196
00:11:09,260 --> 00:11:11,260
Come on let's continue!

197
00:11:12,180 --> 00:11:14,420
You still haven't cut 100 people yet

198
00:11:13,700 --> 00:11:14,420
That's right

199
00:11:14,860 --> 00:11:16,860
What's he at now?

200
00:11:18,060 --> 00:11:20,020
2944 people remaining

201
00:11:20,500 --> 00:11:22,500
Yamazaki...

202
00:11:25,220 --> 00:11:27,220
What should we do?

203
00:11:29,900 --> 00:11:32,340
Please let's

204
00:11:30,580 --> 00:11:32,340
go back to the original number

205
00:11:33,500 --> 00:11:34,780
What did he say?

206
00:11:34,780 --> 00:11:36,420
He want's to go back to the original number

207
00:11:36,420 --> 00:11:40,460
Well I thought you were doing good and all

208
00:11:48,180 --> 00:11:50,220
Can I have a talk...

209
00:11:50,220 --> 00:11:51,260
Huh?

210
00:11:51,260 --> 00:11:53,260
Matsumoto!

211
00:11:55,100 --> 00:11:57,100
He want's to have a talk

212
00:11:57,620 --> 00:12:01,620
Today isn't the day for that

213
00:12:01,060 --> 00:12:03,060
Your right

214
00:12:05,380 --> 00:12:07,660
Let's remove all the extra points hes accumulated

215
00:12:07,660 --> 00:12:09,380
For now let's just do 100

216
00:12:08,660 --> 00:12:10,660
I see... That's good!

217
00:12:09,380 --> 00:12:11,380
So we're resetting it

218
00:12:12,460 --> 00:12:13,300
Good luck!

219
00:12:13,620 --> 00:12:14,980
Are you fine?

220
00:12:14,980 --> 00:12:15,660
It's 100 people!

221
00:12:20,060 --> 00:12:23,140
What is this?

222
00:12:24,980 --> 00:12:26,980
Yamano Ishimatsu!

223
00:12:32,060 --> 00:12:34,580
What is it?

224
00:12:34,580 --> 00:12:36,260
Is 50 people fine?

225
00:12:36,260 --> 00:12:37,940
Can I just cut 50 people?

226
00:12:38,820 --> 00:12:40,820
"Can I just cut 50 people?"

227
00:12:42,580 --> 00:12:45,020
What do you think Matsumoto?

228
00:12:45,020 --> 00:12:47,020
Can you do 50?

229
00:12:47,340 --> 00:12:49,340
Didn't you say you could cut 100 people?

230
00:12:52,380 --> 00:12:54,380
I guess we'll do 50

231
00:12:53,500 --> 00:12:54,380
50 is fine?

232
00:12:54,940 --> 00:12:56,220
Are you sure?

233
00:12:55,340 --> 00:12:56,220
Yea

234
00:12:56,460 --> 00:12:58,460
Thanks

235
00:12:59,380 --> 00:13:04,780
What happens to Yamano Ishimatsu after this?

236
00:13:05,740 --> 00:13:08,980
Celebrating his 20th year into the Performer world!

237
00:13:08,980 --> 00:13:12,700
Yamano Ishimatsu's 100 Cut Challenge!!

238

Wagering on the scales of Duty and Sympathy

239
00:13:17,100 --> 00:13:19,420
A mans world has a heavy sense of duty!

240
00:13:22,820 --> 00:13:26,620
Theres a difference between long and short

241
00:13:27,180 --> 00:13:28,620
COME AT ME!

242
00:13:29,620 --> 00:14:53,020
Remaining

243
00:14:49,900 --> 00:14:50,660

246
00:15:04,540 --> 00:15:05,500
WAIT ISHIMATSU!

247
00:15:05,340 --> 00:15:07,340
ISHIMATSU!

248
00:15:09,340 --> 00:15:11,260
Ishimatsu got away...

249
00:15:11,260 --> 00:15:13,260
He ran away pretty fast huh?

250
00:15:13,580 --> 00:15:15,580
He sure did!

251
00:15:19,460 --> 00:15:20,380
He went quick!

252
00:15:27,340 --> 00:15:30,620
After this Yamazaki's Wailing!

253
00:15:31,100 --> 00:15:32,420
So what happened Matsumoto?

254
00:15:32,420 --> 00:15:34,220
Well...

255
00:15:34,220 --> 00:15:36,580
Sorry everyone but...

256
00:15:36,580 --> 00:15:37,940
Right now....

257
00:15:37,940 --> 00:15:40,660
We have no other choice but to find him

258
00:15:41,900 --> 00:15:43,380
Isnt this for his 20th anniversary

259
00:15:43,540 --> 00:15:45,540
Man this is tiring

260
00:15:44,940 --> 00:15:47,500
It is isn't it!?

261
00:15:46,220 --> 00:15:47,500
Yea it is...

262
00:15:47,980 --> 00:15:49,980
In the end he ran away...

263
00:15:49,980 --> 00:15:54,460
Even in the beginning seconds

264
00:15:52,260 --> 00:15:54,460
He was a lot like Ishimatsu

265
00:15:54,460 --> 00:15:58,220
Suddenly

266
00:15:55,780 --> 00:15:58,220
He already turned into an old man

267
00:15:59,340 --> 00:16:02,860
Meanwhile Yamazaki...

268
00:16:05,860 --> 00:16:09,700
Is hiding in the shadow of the building...

269
00:16:09,700 --> 00:16:11,700
Tanaka you go!

270
00:16:12,580 --> 00:16:14,660
Just to talk right?

271
00:16:13,220 --> 00:16:18,580
They send the loving Tanaka to persuade him...

272
00:16:22,420 --> 00:16:24,180
It's fine!

273
00:16:24,180 --> 00:16:25,500
It's just me!

274
00:16:25,500 --> 00:16:26,980
Yamazaki!

275
00:16:26,980 --> 00:16:28,020
It's just me!

276
00:16:28,020 --> 00:16:29,980
I came just to talk!

277
00:16:29,980 --> 00:16:31,940
Its fine Yamazaki!

278
00:16:31,940 --> 00:16:34,860
Yamazaki its fine!

279
00:16:36,740 --> 00:16:41,660
Yamazaki runs away ignoring Tanaka

280
00:16:39,020 --> 00:16:40,860
Wait Yamazaki!

281
00:16:45,580 --> 00:16:47,140
Its fine it's only me!

282
00:16:48,500 --> 00:16:51,900
I really don't want to see you in the state your in but

283
00:16:55,020 --> 00:16:57,020
Where Yamazaki?

284
00:16:57,500 --> 00:16:59,500
Is he coming?

285
00:17:00,300 --> 00:17:02,700
He's crying

286
00:17:02,700 --> 00:17:04,700
Matsumoto!

287
00:17:04,900 --> 00:17:07,140
He's crying somewhere what do we do?

288
00:17:09,700 --> 00:17:10,580
Hes crying?

289
00:17:10,580 --> 00:17:12,580
Crying you say...

290
00:17:12,900 --> 00:17:17,420
He kept running and running

291
00:17:15,020 --> 00:17:17,420
Towards Omekaido Highway

292
00:17:19,820 --> 00:17:20,820
What the hell!

293
00:17:20,820 --> 00:17:22,260
He kept running and running and finally

294
00:17:22,260 --> 00:17:22,740
Where is he now?

295
00:17:22,740 --> 00:17:23,620
Right now he's just over there

296
00:17:23,620 --> 00:17:25,020
Omekaido Huh?

297
00:17:25,340 --> 00:17:26,580
Can you come Matsumoto?

298
00:17:28,380 --> 00:17:30,380
Yamachan!

299
00:17:33,060 --> 00:17:34,340
Yamachan!

300
00:17:35,260 --> 00:17:37,460
Don't cry like that!

301
00:17:37,460 --> 00:17:39,460
What's wrong!?

302
00:17:45,140 --> 00:17:47,140
Everyone's waiting!

303
00:17:47,900 --> 00:17:49,900
I'm just gonna say it bluntly

304
00:17:50,980 --> 00:17:53,860
I dont understand what your crying about

305
00:17:57,700 --> 00:18:03,060
Anyhow

306
00:18:00,500 --> 00:18:03,060
my back

307
00:18:00,980 --> 00:18:03,060
hurts

308
00:18:03,500 --> 00:18:04,860
It hurts huh?

309
00:18:05,940 --> 00:18:11,140
Well anyways I apologize for myself

310
00:18:11,740 --> 00:18:12,860
Sorry about that

311
00:18:13,180 --> 00:18:16,060
Anyhow

312
00:18:13,780 --> 00:18:16,060
my back

313
00:18:14,220 --> 00:18:16,060
hurts

314
00:18:18,780 --> 00:18:20,780
Be more careful!

315
00:18:21,020 --> 00:18:23,020
Definitely be more careful with your back!

316
00:18:23,340 --> 00:18:26,180
I

317
00:18:24,620 --> 00:18:26,180
only touched it a bit and

318
00:18:26,180 --> 00:18:28,900
It felt like it was on fire!

319
00:18:28,900 --> 00:18:32,460
Alright I understand but you gotta go back

320
00:18:32,460 --> 00:18:36,300
As it is you have to apologize to everyone back there

321
00:18:36,300 --> 00:18:39,300
For now can you just give me some time?

322
00:18:39,300 --> 00:18:42,260
Well, just work a little more

323
00:18:42,260 --> 00:18:44,100
Anyways Yamachan, when we go to cut you

324
00:18:44,100 --> 00:18:46,580
We will yell before we do it

325
00:18:45,340 --> 00:18:46,580
Absolutely!

326
00:18:47,140 --> 00:18:50,540
I really

327
00:18:47,740 --> 00:18:50,540
can't trust you

328
00:18:51,260 --> 00:18:54,780
Well before we didn't know we had to do that!

329
00:18:55,220 --> 00:18:56,580
No, Theres really no way with you

330
00:18:56,580 --> 00:18:59,140
"You"?

331
00:18:59,700 --> 00:19:01,340
Who are you calling "You"

332
00:19:04,860 --> 00:19:06,860
HOUSEI!

333
00:19:07,180 --> 00:19:10,500
Finally Yamazaki...!?

334
00:19:10,900 --> 00:19:12,780
For now go talk to them!

335
00:19:12,780 --> 00:19:13,460
What are you doing?

336
00:19:13,460 --> 00:19:15,460
Its really cold out here!

337
00:19:15,460 --> 00:19:17,340
For now let's go inside and greet them

338
00:19:17,340 --> 00:19:19,340
And then we'll get prepared

339
00:19:19,340 --> 00:19:23,860
For the sake of the 100 cut challenge Matsumoto thinks of an idea!

340
00:19:24,260 --> 00:19:26,820
What if we stick cardboard on your back?

341
00:19:26,820 --> 00:19:28,820
I'm fine with that

342
00:19:29,300 --> 00:19:30,300
Oh really?

343
00:19:30,300 --> 00:19:32,260
Ah that's good!

344
00:19:32,260 --> 00:19:36,500
If we use this it'll be fine

345
00:19:37,060 --> 00:19:39,060
Where else do you want it?

346
00:19:39,380 --> 00:19:42,820
There and here

347
00:19:45,620 --> 00:19:48,300
Don't say it

348
00:19:46,340 --> 00:19:48,300
so nonchalantly

349
00:19:49,020 --> 00:19:51,220
Anyways you look amazing!

350
00:19:51,220 --> 00:19:57,060
Considering

351
00:19:52,460 --> 00:19:57,060
you look like Nobunaga

352
00:19:55,060 --> 00:19:57,060
You should have put on armor or something in the beginning

353
00:19:57,060 --> 00:19:59,060
Sorry about that everyone!

354
00:19:59,060 --> 00:20:00,380
Sorry!

355
00:20:01,420 --> 00:20:03,180
Thank you!

356
00:20:03,180 --> 00:20:04,900
There's no excuse for this

357
00:20:05,860 --> 00:20:09,300
Celebrating his 20th year into the Performer world!

358
00:20:09,300 --> 00:20:12,940
Yamano Ishimatsu's 100 Cut Challenge!!

359
00:20:15,380 --> 00:20:18,980
Wagering on the scales of Duty and Sympathy

360
00:20:18,980 --> 00:20:22,620
A mans world has a heavy sense of duty!

361
00:20:23,860 --> 00:20:27,460
There's a small difference between long and short

362
00:20:27,460 --> 00:20:31,180
It's unrelated to an empty life!

363
00:20:31,980 --> 00:20:33,580
YAMANO ISHIMATSU!

364
00:20:33,580 --> 00:20:35,420

373
00:22:59,380 --> 00:23:00,860
