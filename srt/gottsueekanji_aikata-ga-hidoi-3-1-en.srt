Ume-chan

3
00:00:03,000 --> 00:00:05,870
Good morning

4
00:00:05,870 --> 00:00:06,500
Mornin'

5
00:00:06,870 --> 00:00:07,470
Good morning

6
00:00:07,670 --> 00:00:08,550
Oh, good morning

7
00:00:08,550 --> 00:00:09,220
Imada-kun

8
00:00:09,220 --> 00:00:09,620
Yes?

9
00:00:09,720 --> 00:00:12,170
Um.. what happened.. your kids

10
00:00:12,350 --> 00:00:14,000
They returned, thank you for asking

11
00:00:14,170 --> 00:00:14,870
That's great

12
00:00:14,870 --> 00:00:15,850
It was a neighborhood dog

13
00:00:15,850 --> 00:00:16,470
Really?

14
00:00:17,370 --> 00:00:17,870
Yeah

15
00:00:18,050 --> 00:00:18,920
It was good

16
00:00:18,920 --> 00:00:19,670
Well..

17
00:00:20,050 --> 00:00:22,420
What's wrong? You look gloomy

18
00:00:22,420 --> 00:00:23,850
No..Just my second son

19
00:00:24,250 --> 00:00:24,750
What happened?

20
00:00:25,500 --> 00:00:27,000
He was taken away by a crow

21
00:00:28,600 --> 00:00:31,100
I couldn't help because they were in the sky...

22
00:00:31,550 --> 00:00:32,470
Where do you live?

23
00:00:32,470 --> 00:00:33,670
Around Tondabayashi

24
00:00:34,620 --> 00:00:35,670
By the way I have something to tell you

25
00:00:35,920 --> 00:00:36,350
Nope

26
00:00:36,850 --> 00:00:38,470
Well..I'm sorry about the last time

27
00:00:38,550 --> 00:00:39,100
Huh?

28
00:00:39,370 --> 00:00:39,800
Um...

29
00:00:39,870 --> 00:00:40,850
I'm mad

30
00:00:40,850 --> 00:00:41,470
I know

31
00:00:42,250 --> 00:00:44,170
I think you have every right to be mad

32
00:00:44,670 --> 00:00:46,550
But this time I'm really confident

33
00:00:46,620 --> 00:00:47,300
Are you sure?

34
00:00:47,300 --> 00:00:49,670
How do you say it... we match

35
00:00:50,720 --> 00:00:51,250
Really?

36
00:00:51,370 --> 00:00:53,170
That's the best thing

37
00:00:53,420 --> 00:00:54,620
Can he talk?

38
00:00:54,620 --> 00:00:56,000
He is good at it

39
00:00:56,350 --> 00:00:57,120
Are you sure?

40
00:00:57,870 --> 00:00:59,670
Actually, he's here today

41
00:01:00,050 --> 00:01:01,470
You brought him right?

42
00:01:01,800 --> 00:01:06,170
Yes I did... but I really want you to see our performance

43
00:01:06,970 --> 00:01:08,350
Are you really sure?

44
00:01:07,670 --> 00:01:08,300
Yes

45
00:01:08,750 --> 00:01:10,350
Sorry, everyone can you watch this

46
00:01:10,350 --> 00:01:11,500
Thank you

47
00:01:12,250 --> 00:01:13,050
Ume-chan!

48
00:01:13,600 --> 00:01:14,450
Ume-chan!

49
00:01:25,250 --> 00:01:26,420
This is Ume-chan

50
00:01:26,420 --> 00:01:26,750
Huh?

51
00:01:27,750 --> 00:01:28,800
Turn that off

52
00:01:28,970 --> 00:01:29,550
What?

53
00:01:29,550 --> 00:01:30,220
Turn it off

54
00:01:30,220 --> 00:01:30,800
Turn it off?

55
00:01:31,220 --> 00:01:32,120
Give me 1000 yen

56
00:01:35,420 --> 00:01:37,620
Shut up... stop it

57
00:01:38,000 --> 00:01:38,670
Hey Ume-chan

58
00:01:39,220 --> 00:01:40,550
Introduce yourself

59
00:01:41,050 --> 00:01:42,000
This is Hamada-san

60
00:01:42,000 --> 00:01:43,350
Is he on TV?

61
00:01:43,350 --> 00:01:43,870
Of course

62
00:01:44,000 --> 00:01:45,370
I don't watch TV

63
00:01:45,620 --> 00:01:47,370
I don't watch TV, so I don't know him

64
00:01:48,420 --> 00:01:48,920
Is this him?

65
00:01:48,920 --> 00:01:49,750
Yes, he is my partner

66
00:01:51,300 --> 00:01:52,000
What's your name?

67
00:01:52,350 --> 00:01:52,870
Ume-chan

68
00:01:53,970 --> 00:01:54,920
Ume-chan..?

69
00:01:55,970 --> 00:01:56,750
How old are you?

70
00:01:58,350 --> 00:01:59,870
I don't know, I don't remember

71
00:02:01,100 --> 00:02:02,970
Probably about 38 or so?

72
00:02:04,720 --> 00:02:06,250
Do you have any family?

73
00:02:06,670 --> 00:02:09,470
I wonder what they do now... but I'm sure they hate me

74
00:02:13,250 --> 00:02:15,350
I may have to run away

75
00:02:18,620 --> 00:02:19,620
I just have to tell some jokes, right?

76
00:02:21,050 --> 00:02:23,620
Not really jokes... let's do our performance we practiced

77
00:02:23,620 --> 00:02:24,470
Yes, do it

78
00:02:25,000 --> 00:02:25,870
I'm Ko-chan

79
00:02:25,870 --> 00:02:27,050
Eh..I'm Ume-chan

80
00:02:27,220 --> 00:02:28,600
We are Yokojima..

81
00:02:28,920 --> 00:02:29,750
Typhoon

82
00:02:30,350 --> 00:02:37,600
OK then, let us start...it's getting warmer..and in this
season, what we young people want is girlfriend

83
00:02:37,850 --> 00:02:39,220
Girlfriend? Do you want?

84
00:02:39,220 --> 00:02:40,250
Of course I want

85
00:02:40,250 --> 00:02:41,220
I don't really want one

86
00:02:41,220 --> 00:02:41,800
Sure?

87
00:02:41,800 --> 00:02:42,850
Well I want one

88
00:02:42,850 --> 00:02:44,500
You do right?

89
00:02:44,500 --> 00:02:45,250
Which is it!

90
00:02:45,250 --> 00:02:46,500
I want to have a date

91
00:02:46,620 --> 00:02:49,420
Oh date! I want to go to an amusement park

92
00:02:49,420 --> 00:02:50,370
I don't care for it

93
00:02:50,550 --> 00:02:51,350
You don't care for it?

94
00:02:51,420 --> 00:02:52,220
I'm going tomorrow though

95
00:02:52,220 --> 00:02:54,220
Are you going tomorrow..? So which!

96
00:02:54,220 --> 00:02:54,970
Which is it?

97
00:02:57,920 --> 00:03:00,920
As for an amusement park, there is a Ferris wheel that goes around

98
00:03:00,920 --> 00:03:02,250
I don't care for Ferris wheel

99
00:03:02,250 --> 00:03:03,220
Are you sure?
- Yea

100
00:03:03,470 --> 00:03:04,970
I don't like that kind

101
00:03:04,970 --> 00:03:06,420
Are you sure? I like it!

102
00:03:07,300 --> 00:03:08,500
I'm going to ride on it though

103
00:03:08,670 --> 00:03:11,720
The view from the top must be great

104
00:03:11,720 --> 00:03:12,720
Yea, I think so

105
00:03:12,750 --> 00:03:14,220
You can see a lot

106
00:03:14,220 --> 00:03:15,800
I don't care for views

107
00:03:15,800 --> 00:03:16,370
Are you sure?

108
00:03:16,370 --> 00:03:17,120
I'll watch it though

109
00:03:17,120 --> 00:03:20,370
I also like roller coasters

110
00:03:21,850 --> 00:03:23,750
When you ride on a roller coaster,

111
00:03:24,050 --> 00:03:25,050
Everyone..

112
00:03:25,370 --> 00:03:28,050
Roller coaster is scary but fun, isn't it?

113
00:03:28,720 --> 00:03:29,750
It's scary

114
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:31,800
But it's also fun

115
00:03:31,800 --> 00:03:33,500
End it...That's it

116
00:03:33,970 --> 00:03:34,720
What are you doing?

117
00:03:36,350 --> 00:03:36,970
Let me see

118
00:03:42,300 --> 00:03:43,050
Let me see

119
00:03:43,500 --> 00:03:44,250
What?

120
00:03:44,970 --> 00:03:46,250
Let me see what you took from me

121
00:03:47,170 --> 00:03:49,120
You took my watch, right?

122
00:03:49,870 --> 00:03:50,600
No I didn't

123
00:03:50,600 --> 00:03:52,600
Show me... check there

124
00:03:53,750 --> 00:03:54,920
Check his pocker

125
00:03:56,670 --> 00:03:57,350
Got it right?

126
00:03:58,720 --> 00:03:59,870
I can hear it

127
00:04:02,670 --> 00:04:04,550
There it is

128
00:04:07,000 --> 00:04:07,870
What are you doing?

129
00:04:08,500 --> 00:04:09,550
Hey come here

130
00:04:10,500 --> 00:04:12,800
Come here... what were you doing during your performance?

131
00:04:15,000 --> 00:04:16,100
You got more to show right?

132
00:04:16,850 --> 00:04:18,500
Nothing more

133
00:04:19,750 --> 00:04:20,970
You saw it right?

134
00:04:22,970 --> 00:04:23,500
You did right?

135
00:04:25,800 --> 00:04:27,350
You did right!
- WHAT!

136
00:04:30,670 --> 00:04:31,370
You saw it right

137
00:04:32,220 --> 00:04:32,850
You saw it right?

138
00:04:33,720 --> 00:04:34,850
He took it right

139
00:04:35,470 --> 00:04:36,370
He did right

140
00:04:39,620 --> 00:04:40,420
What?

141
00:04:41,720 --> 00:04:42,350
Did you put it on there?

142
00:04:42,750 --> 00:04:43,170
No

143
00:04:44,750 --> 00:04:46,350
It wasn't there, did you put it there?

144
00:04:46,350 --> 00:04:47,800
No no no..it was there all this time

145
00:04:47,920 --> 00:04:49,550
He put it there right?

146
00:04:51,920 --> 00:04:52,670
Shall we go to the police?

147
00:04:52,670 --> 00:04:52,970
Eh

148
00:04:56,350 --> 00:04:57,350
Let's go to the police

149
00:05:00,550 --> 00:05:01,000
What?

150
00:05:02,350 --> 00:05:03,420
I don't understand

151
00:05:03,620 --> 00:05:05,870
No..not that...it was all performance

152
00:05:06,970 --> 00:05:08,470
Performance

153
00:05:10,120 --> 00:05:19,100
Well... Koji-kun and I were planning on take stuff from
the audience and then give it back at the end

154
00:05:19,920 --> 00:05:20,750
Is it true?

155
00:05:22,600 --> 00:05:23,550
Or is he lying?

156
00:05:23,550 --> 00:05:24,500
Yes he is

157
00:05:28,470 --> 00:05:30,670
You took my money right?

158
00:05:31,120 --> 00:05:31,550
Hey!

159
00:05:32,670 --> 00:05:33,220
Damn you!

160
00:05:35,100 --> 00:05:36,220
It doesn't make sense

161
00:05:38,870 --> 00:05:39,420
Get him

162
00:05:40,370 --> 00:05:41,870
What you are saying does not make any sense

163
00:05:48,220 --> 00:05:48,750
Ouch

164
00:05:51,050 --> 00:05:51,720
OUCH!

165
00:06:06,850 --> 00:06:07,850
Hey you!

166
00:06:11,050 --> 00:06:12,300
I have to apologize

167
00:06:12,870 --> 00:06:14,800
Call the police...Go!

168
00:06:22,920 --> 00:06:24,250
Forgive me already!

169
00:06:27,850 --> 00:06:28,720
What the hell

170
00:06:33,970 --> 00:06:34,800
Are you crazy?

171
00:06:35,750 --> 00:06:36,170
Come here

172
00:06:37,000 --> 00:06:37,500
What?

173
00:06:38,600 --> 00:06:39,100
Come here!

174
00:06:40,120 --> 00:06:42,300
Hey what kind of attitude is that?

175
00:06:45,600 --> 00:06:46,970
I'm going home! I'm going home!

176
00:06:48,170 --> 00:06:48,920
I'm going!

177
00:06:51,970 --> 00:06:52,670
Get away!

178
00:06:55,000 --> 00:06:55,550
Shut up

179
00:07:00,620 --> 00:07:01,750
Give me back my radio!

180
00:07:27,470 --> 00:07:28,170
Everyone, I'm sorry
