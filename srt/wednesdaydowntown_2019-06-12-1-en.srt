00:00:02,710 --> 00:00:04,670
Welcome to Wednesday Downtown,

2
00:00:07,010 --> 00:00:10,390
Let's get on with our first presenter please

3
00:00:16,540 --> 00:00:19,270
Jinnai Tomonori!

4
00:00:21,940 --> 00:00:28,650
Do you all remember the suspicious person who appeared in the "live broadcast"?

5
00:00:31,040 --> 00:00:34,520
I do
-That was fun

6
00:00:34,520 --> 00:00:37,180
For this supposed live broadcast

7
00:00:37,180 --> 00:00:41,670
Yoshimura did very well

8
00:00:41,670 --> 00:00:45,000
His popularity rose
-He was on network news

9
00:00:45,000 --> 00:00:47,230
Yoshimura received great acclaim

10
00:00:47,230 --> 00:00:50,660
This revealed that experience helps

11
00:00:50,660 --> 00:00:54,740
As Abareru and Ogata both got into a little panic

12
00:00:54,740 --> 00:00:58,440
Maybe they didn't perform well because they're not senior enough
-That's it!

13
00:00:58,990 --> 00:01:01,710
So, this time, i've brought the following theory

14
00:01:02,470 --> 00:01:08,620
If a suspicious person interrupts a live broadcast, an experienced announcer can handle it perfectly

15
00:01:09,410 --> 00:01:11,420
I see. How will veterans deal with it

16
00:01:12,000 --> 00:01:17,290
After this, veteran announcer vs. suspicious passersby

17
00:01:17,290 --> 00:01:18,030
Also

18
00:01:18,030 --> 00:01:19,820
I got married at the age of 16

19
00:01:20,220 --> 00:01:23,490
Another collection of families with a small age gap

20
00:01:23,490 --> 00:01:26,000
The 2nd 4 Generation Relay Competition

21
00:01:26,240 --> 00:01:32,240
Then, when getting hit by a colorless stinky air cannon while being criticized

22
00:01:32,240 --> 00:01:33,980
You won't mention the stench

23
00:01:51,440 --> 00:01:58,800
If a suspicious person interrupts a live broadcast, an experienced announcer can handle it perfectly

24
00:01:57,090 --> 00:01:58,570
What kind of people will do it?

25
00:01:58,570 --> 00:02:00,160
Let's see who it is

26
00:01:59,650 --> 00:02:05,920
This time we set up a supposed live broadcast

27
00:02:06,580 --> 00:02:10,200
And invited experienced craftsmen with more than 30 years of experience

28
00:02:11,150 --> 00:02:16,060
To cover a BBQ venue in Saitama for a fictional program

29
00:02:15,840 --> 00:02:17,120
Seems legitimate

30
00:02:17,350 --> 00:02:21,910
During the live broadcast, the suspicious passerby will pay a visit

31
00:02:22,430 --> 00:02:28,460
Of course, this time, the actor who was previously well-received for his role as a suspicious character, is back again

32
00:02:28,720 --> 00:02:36,540
This is the case. The first target is Akihiro Yoshimura, 44th year of the Era.

33
00:02:35,530 --> 00:02:37,740
You got a great guy!

34
00:02:38,510 --> 00:02:45,540
Yoshimura has been on air every week for ten years

35
00:02:38,510 --> 00:02:45,540
※A long-running Japanese variety show broadcast on TBS from 11:45 to 12:54 every Sunday since October 6, 1985

36
00:02:45,540 --> 00:02:46,570
How will he handle the situation?

37
00:02:47,680 --> 00:02:50,210
The live broadcast begins

38
00:02:52,020 --> 00:02:57,420
This time we have Mr. Akihiro Yoshimura, come on out, Mr. Yoshimura~

39
00:03:00,500 --> 00:03:02,610
Hello, I'm Akihiro Yoshimura!

40
00:03:04,870 --> 00:03:07,190
It's really nice to have a BBQ in spring

41
00:03:07,190 --> 00:03:14,100
So today, we came to the BBQ site in Saitama, Arima Gorge

42
00:03:14,970 --> 00:03:21,050
At this point in the broadcast, we get the guy out as soon as possible

43
00:03:15,080 --> 00:03:16,780
Feels stable

44
00:03:16,780 --> 00:03:18,660
He's worthy!

45
00:03:21,050 --> 00:03:25,670
In this new green period of the coming summer

46
00:03:25,670 --> 00:03:27,890
BBQ in spring like this

47
00:03:28,820 --> 00:03:32,010
It may not have much to do with summer...

48
00:03:32,290 --> 00:03:35,830
Are you OK?

49
00:03:35,830 --> 00:03:38,030
We're live right now!

50
00:03:38,030 --> 00:03:39,230
Brother. Brother.
-Is it okay?

51
00:03:41,150 --> 00:03:44,640
So today we come to interview people who are interested in fishing...

52
00:03:44,640 --> 00:03:48,360
To interview rainbow trout fishermen

53
00:03:48,510 --> 00:03:51,240
Brother, what are you doing here...are you here to fish?

54
00:03:51,240 --> 00:03:52,710
Brother, brother, are you fishing...

55
00:03:54,110 --> 00:03:55,550
Did you come to fish?

56
00:03:55,550 --> 00:03:57,220
Fishing, fishing

57
00:03:57,220 --> 00:03:59,820
Brother... brother let's fish

58
00:03:59,820 --> 00:04:01,750
Brother, let's fish, come on

59
00:04:02,540 --> 00:04:05,810
With the sudden intrusion, although there is a moment of timidity

60
00:04:06,510 --> 00:04:10,110
He quickly recovers and continues the live coverage

61
00:04:10,620 --> 00:04:11,380
And

62
00:04:11,380 --> 00:04:16,230
There are still a lot of fishermen, let's turn back a little to see

63
00:04:16,230 --> 00:04:17,860
There is a foot bath

64
00:04:18,780 --> 00:04:24,060
Because there are very few people today, you can soak your feet for a little rest

65
00:04:24,060 --> 00:04:26,610
Look this way next

66
00:04:26,610 --> 00:04:29,550
Great, great, too impressive

67
00:04:29,550 --> 00:04:30,550
So cool!

68
00:04:32,580 --> 00:04:36,720
There may be those who come fishing without their equipment

69
00:04:36,720 --> 00:04:39,590
There are also BBQ sets full sets can be rented

70
00:04:39,590 --> 00:04:45,160
The cost of a set (half day) is 2500 yen and 3700 yen a day

71
00:04:45,160 --> 00:04:48,560
People with no rod and bait can also come here to rent

72
00:04:49,020 --> 00:04:51,720
In such a way, he throws the topic to distant building facilities

73
00:04:52,480 --> 00:04:56,720
To cleverly lead the camera to the place where the crazy guy isn't

74
00:04:56,720 --> 00:05:00,200
A skill that only veterans possess

75
00:04:59,860 --> 00:05:01,260
Worthy of a veteran

76
00:05:01,300 --> 00:05:05,590
Afterwards, as usual, after properly handling this pestering guy

77
00:05:05,590 --> 00:05:09,800
Then we will introduce you to the BBQ venue afterwards

78
00:05:09,800 --> 00:05:12,960
I'll take you back to the studio for now.
-Thank you

79
00:05:12,740 --> 00:05:14,350
Easy to get around him

80
00:05:12,960 --> 00:05:18,400
Reducing the impact to a minimum with this wonderful performance, the camera goes back to the studio

81
00:05:19,160 --> 00:05:24,800
After that, he continued to report cheerfully without showing any sense of surprise

82
00:05:24,840 --> 00:05:29,310
This is a staff problem
-The staff should have gone to stop it

83
00:05:29,780 --> 00:05:34,690
The next step is to escalate the crazy level

84
00:05:35,230 --> 00:05:36,300
What exactly will happen?

85
00:05:36,300 --> 00:05:38,420
There are young people fishing here

86
00:05:38,420 --> 00:05:40,600
They're taking a break for a while

87
00:05:42,510 --> 00:05:45,170
Do you guys have any fishing experience in the sea, river or something like that?

88
00:05:45,170 --> 00:05:47,990
No.
-No?

89
00:05:47,990 --> 00:05:50,440
But most people would have been to the fishing pond, right?

90
00:05:50,440 --> 00:05:54,000
I haven't been there either.
-It's also not common anymore

91
00:05:56,600 --> 00:06:01,040
Wait a minute, brother, brother...

92
00:06:01,040 --> 00:06:03,360
There are rainbow trout here, right?

93
00:06:04,910 --> 00:06:06,980
Are you all right, brother?

94
00:06:10,750 --> 00:06:12,080
Brother...

95
00:06:12,080 --> 00:06:13,650
You're not a zombie either, okay?

96
00:06:13,650 --> 00:06:16,120
Brother, move slightly to the side... just stay there for a bit

97
00:06:16,120 --> 00:06:17,260
I'm so sorry!

98
00:06:18,400 --> 00:06:24,440
From the river, a wet zombie appears and its still greeted with a smile

99
00:06:25,040 --> 00:06:27,900
So here we reveal the project

100
00:06:28,100 --> 00:06:32,270
May I ask what program you thought you were invited to today?

101
00:06:32,270 --> 00:06:35,570
Eh... Uncle Broadcast

102
00:06:36,110 --> 00:06:39,110
It's actually Wednesday Downtown

103
00:06:39,110 --> 00:06:40,750
Eh?

104
00:06:40,980 --> 00:06:44,680
That's why a guy like that came?
-Yes

105
00:06:46,350 --> 00:06:48,420
You guys are skilled

106
00:06:48,420 --> 00:06:49,590
Terrific

107
00:06:49,590 --> 00:06:50,620
I'm impressed

108
00:06:50,620 --> 00:06:52,320
Even went in the water

109
00:06:52,320 --> 00:06:53,090
It's so cold

110
00:06:54,240 --> 00:06:56,030
The next target is

111
00:06:57,020 --> 00:07:00,660
32 years experience, Kikuhime Hayashiya

112
00:06:59,860 --> 00:07:00,800
Same as my rakugo

113
00:07:00,800 --> 00:07:01,740
She's a woman

114
00:07:01,610 --> 00:07:09,700
Kikuhime who was active as an announcer on TBS's information program "Just" in the first half of the 2000s

115
00:07:01,610 --> 00:07:09,700
※"Just" was broadcast live on TBS Life from September 28, 1998 to March 25, 2005 in the afternoon on weekdays

116
00:07:07,950 --> 00:07:10,840
A woman

117
00:07:09,700 --> 00:07:11,540
Let's get started

118
00:07:11,750 --> 00:07:13,190
Could be a little scared

119
00:07:13,240 --> 00:07:15,080
This is the lake called Lake Naguri

120
00:07:15,080 --> 00:07:18,800
It may sound shocking to hear the name of autumn chestnut

121
00:07:18,820 --> 00:07:21,620
What? Hello, brother?

122
00:07:21,620 --> 00:07:23,090
Would you like to present for us?

123
00:07:23,090 --> 00:07:26,830
It's very sudden but sorry. Are you here to play too?

124
00:07:26,830 --> 00:07:30,360
You are also here, it's a little... sorry... so suddenly

125
00:07:30,360 --> 00:07:35,800
And then around here, there's also boating in this lake

126
00:07:31,210 --> 00:07:34,410
Hasn't changed her face yet

127
00:07:35,800 --> 00:07:38,560
There are also places to fish

128
00:07:38,560 --> 00:07:42,350
In autumn, you can also enjoy the beautiful maple leaves here

129
00:07:42,350 --> 00:07:44,740
What a great place!

130
00:07:44,740 --> 00:07:46,610
So let's take a look at this side again

131
00:07:46,610 --> 00:07:48,750
There seems to be a visitor who is having a good time

132
00:07:49,900 --> 00:07:53,680
For the sudden arrival of the crazy guy

133
00:07:53,680 --> 00:07:56,620
This one also continues without the slightest panic

134
00:07:57,540 --> 00:08:00,460
How many people came together today?
-5 people or so

135
00:08:00,460 --> 00:08:04,630
Did you fish often?
-My supervisor is more...

136
00:08:04,630 --> 00:08:06,690
Ah, this is your boss.
-Yes, for now

137
00:08:07,780 --> 00:08:10,130
Do you fish often?

138
00:08:11,110 --> 00:08:14,400
There are no opportunities after work

139
00:08:18,540 --> 00:08:20,580
Wow, wet, why are you wet this time?

140
00:08:20,580 --> 00:08:23,350
Wait a minute, that... Why are you wet this time?

141
00:08:23,980 --> 00:08:28,280
You don't seem to be catching much fish here, so I'll come back when you get some

142
00:08:28,780 --> 00:08:33,480
Some uneasiness is felt about the river appearence

143
00:08:33,480 --> 00:08:34,570
Next

144
00:08:34,570 --> 00:08:39,590
It's okay, because the climate is great. It's very pleasant

145
00:08:39,590 --> 00:08:43,260
Being able to do it under the blue sky is also one of the joys of BBQ

146
00:08:43,260 --> 00:08:45,900
From my perspective as an older woman, I like it

147
00:08:45,900 --> 00:08:47,560
It's cool and you don't sweat

148
00:08:47,560 --> 00:08:49,920
All equipment can be rented here

149
00:08:49,920 --> 00:08:53,180
I like it, so I suggest you try it too!

150
00:08:53,180 --> 00:08:55,430
Surely an instinctive reaction would manifest slightly?

151
00:08:55,890 --> 00:09:00,040
Ultimately, she ends up in a scary situation live

152
00:09:00,650 --> 00:09:03,660
We are actually Wednesday Downtown

153
00:09:10,190 --> 00:09:12,500
My favorite show!

154
00:09:12,500 --> 00:09:13,360
I love it!

155
00:09:13,870 --> 00:09:18,640
Despite saying this, she failed to realise

156
00:09:19,170 --> 00:09:20,740
What kind of theory do you think this is?

157
00:09:21,170 --> 00:09:22,670
What theory?

158
00:09:22,870 --> 00:09:24,410
It's your favorite program, after all

159
00:09:23,710 --> 00:09:26,810
Joints and such? Eh what what what? Joints?

160
00:09:26,810 --> 00:09:27,580
What joints?

161
00:09:27,580 --> 00:09:31,120
That... the knee joint

162
00:09:29,880 --> 00:09:30,850
What theory?

163
00:09:30,850 --> 00:09:32,250
You don't even know this show, right?

164
00:09:31,120 --> 00:09:32,480
Bone joint?

165
00:09:32,250 --> 00:09:34,250
Definitely doesn't know the program

166
00:09:33,250 --> 00:09:39,120
Regardless of whether they're funny or not, veteran broadcasters are undoubtedly skilled like the theory suggests

167
00:09:39,120 --> 00:09:41,860
Don't say stuff like "regardless of whether they're funny or not"

168
00:09:42,150 --> 00:09:43,920
The next target is...

169
00:09:43,920 --> 00:09:45,890
Hi~ I'm Nakamura!

170
00:09:45,890 --> 00:09:48,920
Known as TVchampion's former announcer

171
00:09:45,890 --> 00:09:51,870
※TVchampion was a variety show broadcast on TV Tokyo every Thursday from 19:30 to 20:50 from April 16, 1992 to September 21, 2006

172
00:09:48,920 --> 00:09:51,870
Yuki Nakamura with 45 years of experience

173
00:09:51,870 --> 00:09:54,740
Today we came to Arima Valley

174
00:09:56,440 --> 00:09:59,910
It takes about an hour and a half to get here by car from Tokyo

175
00:09:59,910 --> 00:10:01,580
That...can...can reach

176
00:10:01,960 --> 00:10:05,340
Possibly because he hasn't been on TV for too long

177
00:10:05,340 --> 00:10:08,380
Nakamura stumbles even without obstacles

178
00:10:07,850 --> 00:10:08,820
Don't say such things

179
00:10:09,100 --> 00:10:10,380
So we get things moving

180
00:10:10,380 --> 00:10:12,260
The maple leaves in autumn are really...

181
00:10:13,180 --> 00:10:16,690
The tourists coming for a walk also... should be a lot

182
00:10:19,600 --> 00:10:21,530
Hey, hey, wait a little bit!

183
00:10:21,530 --> 00:10:23,330
We... we're on the air now!

184
00:10:23,330 --> 00:10:25,340
Where did you come from today?

185
00:10:26,070 --> 00:10:27,340
Wait a minute, wait a minute...

186
00:10:30,860 --> 00:10:35,180
It is obvious that the unexpected appearance of unexpected and suspicious people is a surprise

187
00:10:36,100 --> 00:10:38,420
Rainbow trout can be caught here!

188
00:10:44,390 --> 00:10:46,390
Are you going to follow me all the time?

189
00:10:46,390 --> 00:10:49,060
Because we are live a lot of things will happen

190
00:10:49,060 --> 00:10:52,900
Eh, this customer seems to be particularly fond of the camera

191
00:10:54,170 --> 00:10:57,800
Please go to the side... just a little bit

192
00:10:58,810 --> 00:11:02,270
It's a completely incoherent

193
00:11:03,660 --> 00:11:08,520
The river appearance is also a mess

194
00:11:12,720 --> 00:11:16,190
Give me a break!

195
00:11:16,190 --> 00:11:19,790
Always in a state of handicap, the broadcast ends

196
00:11:20,960 --> 00:11:23,540
After that the fourth target is

197
00:11:24,460 --> 00:11:28,130
Mr. Chin with 33 years of experience

198
00:11:29,080 --> 00:11:32,930
A veteran broadcaster who is known for his door-to-door visits to outside locations

199
00:11:33,980 --> 00:11:37,240
How will he deal with it?

200
00:11:37,240 --> 00:11:41,100
You can also see maple leaves here in autumn

201
00:11:41,100 --> 00:11:44,600
It's a great place to get away from it all

202
00:11:45,590 --> 00:11:50,460
So today, sir, sorry, thank you

203
00:11:50,460 --> 00:11:52,940
Today ah, let's see...

204
00:11:54,030 --> 00:11:55,080
Sir, sorry...

205
00:11:55,080 --> 00:11:57,030
No problem?
-Yes.

206
00:11:57,030 --> 00:11:59,200
Excuse me, sir, what's wrong with you? I'm sorry

207
00:11:59,200 --> 00:12:06,240
Today, let's see how happy the spring BBQ is!

208
00:12:06,240 --> 00:12:07,690
I would like to introduce you to

209
00:12:07,810 --> 00:12:10,610
I'm sorry, but we're shooting now

210
00:12:11,180 --> 00:12:14,090
Treating suspicious people with a smile

211
00:12:14,620 --> 00:12:18,950
Mr. Chin, who speaks to others while looking them in the eye

212
00:12:19,900 --> 00:12:21,440
But after that

213
00:12:23,550 --> 00:12:25,720
Sir, I know, what is wrong with you?

214
00:12:25,720 --> 00:12:28,860
What are you doing here? What's going on? Is there a problem?

215
00:12:29,430 --> 00:12:30,330
I'm sorry...

216
00:12:30,940 --> 00:12:35,630
Busy with the crazy guy, the broadcast is neglected

217
00:12:37,340 --> 00:12:39,810
At this moment the broadcast goes back to the studio

218
00:12:39,810 --> 00:12:43,980
To let the staff intervene to get rid of the crazy guy

219
00:12:43,980 --> 00:12:45,370
Then

220
00:12:45,580 --> 00:12:47,510
Sir, what's wrong with you?

221
00:12:47,710 --> 00:12:51,320
What's going on? What's wrong? It's okay?

222
00:12:51,320 --> 00:12:52,360
Very kind

223
00:12:53,250 --> 00:12:55,620
Don't be  too rough with him

224
00:12:55,620 --> 00:13:02,580
Mr. Chin, more concerned about the man than the flow of the broadcast, is thrown off slightly

225
00:12:55,660 --> 00:12:57,290
A nice guy

226
00:13:03,590 --> 00:13:06,860
I can tell that this is a kind person...

227
00:13:07,340 --> 00:13:08,840
And

228
00:13:08,840 --> 00:13:11,190
It's great to catch two of them!

229
00:13:15,750 --> 00:13:16,790
For newbies

230
00:13:17,880 --> 00:13:20,550
What? What?

231
00:13:20,550 --> 00:13:21,910
What's going on? What on earthl?

232
00:13:22,850 --> 00:13:25,780
Come on up! Let's get you up!

233
00:13:31,860 --> 00:13:34,660
What is going on?

234
00:13:36,660 --> 00:13:39,160
That towel, towel towel towel

235
00:13:38,730 --> 00:13:42,800
He's too nice!

236
00:13:43,570 --> 00:13:45,940
I'm sorry, you were shocked, right?

237
00:13:45,940 --> 00:13:47,140
I was shocked too

238
00:13:47,800 --> 00:13:50,370
Alongside helping the crazy guy

239
00:13:50,370 --> 00:13:53,790
He also doesn't forget the subject of the interview

240
00:13:53,790 --> 00:13:58,380
Aside from being a broadcaster, he is an excellent human being

241
00:13:58,540 --> 00:14:02,090
It's really comfortable to be in nature

242
00:14:02,090 --> 00:14:04,560
Indeed, you will also want to jump into the water

243
00:14:04,560 --> 00:14:07,730
Because it's comfortable. It's comfortable, right?

244
00:14:07,730 --> 00:14:10,460
You'll want to jump in... don't jump is fine too

245
00:14:10,460 --> 00:14:12,700
It's okay not to dive

246
00:14:16,600 --> 00:14:18,070
This kid is so excited!

247
00:14:20,160 --> 00:14:24,000
In a state where even Chin can't do anything

248
00:14:24,000 --> 00:14:25,030
We reveal the truth

249
00:14:26,080 --> 00:14:27,150
Afterwards

250
00:14:28,180 --> 00:14:31,650
That person is from Wednesday Downtown?

251
00:14:31,650 --> 00:14:32,650
I'm really sorry

252
00:14:32,600 --> 00:14:35,050
He is a well-mannered person

253
00:14:32,650 --> 00:14:35,690
No this is great!

254
00:14:35,690 --> 00:14:37,960
I wanna cry

255
00:14:37,960 --> 00:14:41,730
I was also moved to tears because you are so gentle

256
00:14:41,960 --> 00:14:45,060
Well, that's great

257
00:14:45,060 --> 00:14:48,070
What the hell, really?

258
00:14:48,860 --> 00:14:52,620
An unexpected and heart-warming scene

259
00:14:54,070 --> 00:14:56,720
The final target is

260
00:14:58,150 --> 00:15:02,150
The oldest, 79-year-old Eiji Bando

261
00:15:03,800 --> 00:15:05,510
...apologizing just now

262
00:15:05,510 --> 00:15:08,390
Sorry for wearing the Lions hat

263
00:15:05,510 --> 00:15:10,160
※The Lions refer to the Saitama Seibu Lions, a team in the Pacific League of Nippon Professional Baseball.

264
00:15:08,390 --> 00:15:10,160
That kind of thing is fine

265
00:15:15,930 --> 00:15:17,630
Did something happen?
-Sorry, a little...

266
00:15:17,630 --> 00:15:21,600
What's wrong?
-That's a little...

267
00:15:21,600 --> 00:15:24,200
Because it is a live broadcast, sorry

268
00:15:24,830 --> 00:15:28,020
Although this part has unfolded similarly so far

269
00:15:27,560 --> 00:15:29,620
It feels like something bad is going to happen

270
00:15:29,620 --> 00:15:31,470
Raise it a little. Raise it a little

271
00:15:31,470 --> 00:15:34,050
It's good to shoot here

272
00:15:34,050 --> 00:15:37,550
Caught! Great!

273
00:15:40,070 --> 00:15:41,340
You guys keep up the good work!

274
00:15:43,190 --> 00:15:44,320
Sorry

275
00:15:44,700 --> 00:15:45,400
Pushed away

276
00:15:45,400 --> 00:15:46,640
Slightly pushed away

277
00:15:46,490 --> 00:15:48,590
Because it's live

278
00:15:47,520 --> 00:15:49,250
Just pushed him

279
00:15:49,460 --> 00:15:55,510
BBQ is fully available here, and is waiting for your reservation

280
00:15:55,760 --> 00:15:57,370
Pushed away hard

281
00:15:58,010 --> 00:16:03,040
The forced removal of a suspicious person causing trouble constantly

282
00:16:03,660 --> 00:16:05,580
Tough to shoot

283
00:16:04,330 --> 00:16:05,660
And

284
00:16:05,660 --> 00:16:07,940
As we need to prepare a little now

285
00:16:07,940 --> 00:16:13,320
Let's go back to the studio please
-Okay thanks

286
00:16:13,320 --> 00:16:16,830
Later, we will introduce more beautiful places, please look forward to it!

287
00:16:18,360 --> 00:16:20,360
Broadcast back to the studio

288
00:16:21,180 --> 00:16:23,440
Damn, I'm scared

289
00:16:23,440 --> 00:16:25,200
Can this be broadcast?

290
00:16:25,200 --> 00:16:27,570
This is something that can't be broadcast, right?

291
00:16:28,920 --> 00:16:32,210
Just watch for the time being

292
00:16:35,820 --> 00:16:40,750
In summary
It seems like some parts of this wont make it to broadcast

293
00:16:41,630 --> 00:16:42,940
It can't be helped

294
00:16:42,940 --> 00:16:48,640
I'm thinking the whole of the last part will have to be cut

295
00:16:50,360 --> 00:16:55,080
I'm sure there's some discussions going on about compliance

296
00:16:55,080 --> 00:16:58,490
Matsumoto, what do you think?
-About what?

297
00:17:01,260 --> 00:17:02,980
Please comment on Bando's part first

298
00:17:02,980 --> 00:17:07,280
I think it was spiritually invigorating

299
00:17:07,280 --> 00:17:08,720
It won't be forgotten

300
00:17:08,720 --> 00:17:15,000
We've once again witnessed the spirit of Showa-era men that had been forgotten

301
00:17:15,000 --> 00:17:18,810
They have to find a way to make the show work

302
00:17:18,810 --> 00:17:22,110
Bando was the only one to not interact with the guy

303
00:17:22,110 --> 00:17:25,440
Because he thought he was trying to cause trouble on purpose

304
00:17:25,440 --> 00:17:28,090
He was pretty cool

305
00:17:28,090 --> 00:17:31,180
How about we just don't say the name "Bando" in the clip

306
00:17:32,420 --> 00:17:33,540
Everyone will still know!

307
00:17:34,970 --> 00:17:37,030
Just write "Some Old Man"

308
00:17:39,200 --> 00:17:41,380
Or refer to him as just A

309
00:17:44,160 --> 00:17:45,410
It was a shocking sight wasn't it

310
00:17:45,410 --> 00:17:48,150
Can you do this to him?

311
00:17:49,680 --> 00:17:51,950
The voice is so obviously his!

312
00:17:53,490 --> 00:17:55,720
I feel like covering the eyes will work

313
00:17:55,720 --> 00:17:59,000
And make the name A or B or something like that

314
00:18:00,140 --> 00:18:02,730
So everyone please look forward to the eventual broadcast

315
00:18:02,730 --> 00:18:04,700
I'm scared it'll get cut

316
00:18:06,360 --> 00:18:12,040
Yeah but this show is so stupid

317
00:18:14,020 --> 00:18:16,540
Let's welcome the next presenter

318
00:18:20,480 --> 00:18:21,550
Hello everyone

319
00:18:23,580 --> 00:18:26,100
It's Shimofuri!

320
00:18:26,140 --> 00:18:27,830
Hello everyone

321
00:18:30,760 --> 00:18:34,160
This time, we are not bringing a theory but a project

322
00:18:34,160 --> 00:18:36,190
Really?
-Yes.

323
00:18:36,190 --> 00:18:37,810
I hope its something heart-warming

324
00:18:37,810 --> 00:18:38,510
True

325
00:18:39,470 --> 00:18:41,260
I hope this next segment will be aired in its entirety

326
00:18:41,260 --> 00:18:41,900
It should be

327
00:18:42,250 --> 00:18:44,000
Please offset the bad vibes

328
00:18:44,290 --> 00:18:45,790
What we have brought is this:

329
00:18:47,160 --> 00:18:49,450
The 2nd 4 Generation Relay Competition

330
00:18:50,110 --> 00:18:51,010
Oh yeah

331
00:18:51,010 --> 00:19:00,950
Previously we had a children Mothers Grandmothers and Great-grandmothers relay race

332
00:19:01,190 --> 00:19:05,790
How about this, the family aspect is heart-warming, right?

333
00:19:05,790 --> 00:19:06,460
Yes, warm

334
00:19:07,870 --> 00:19:10,090
Just a little relay race...

335
00:19:10,100 --> 00:19:11,410
It has nothing to do with the relay race, right?

336
00:19:11,410 --> 00:19:14,000
No, no, no. Relay is also very good

337
00:19:14,000 --> 00:19:15,710
Are relay races really heartwarming?

338
00:19:16,170 --> 00:19:17,400
It can be a chance for family bonding

339
00:19:17,400 --> 00:19:20,380
Can just a little bit of heartwarming content fill the hole we have now?

340
00:19:21,040 --> 00:19:22,770
Well, the last part was a bit much

341
00:19:37,180 --> 00:19:40,280
The 2nd 4 Generation Relay Competition

342
00:19:42,270 --> 00:19:51,200
This time, we decided the order as children to great-grandmothers for the race

343
00:19:52,440 --> 00:19:56,760
First of all, we came to this store in Asahi City, Chiba Prefecture

344
00:19:58,950 --> 00:20:01,970
The four families in the first group of the competition are

345
00:20:02,400 --> 00:20:03,760
Hello

346
00:20:04,210 --> 00:20:05,200
The Yoshida Family

347
00:20:07,530 --> 00:20:14,140
Firstly, Nana, a 23-year-old mother of two, introduces her family

348
00:20:09,790 --> 00:20:13,090
So young!

349
00:20:14,560 --> 00:20:16,530
This is the great-great-grandmother

350
00:20:16,530 --> 00:20:17,850
92 years-old

351
00:20:20,060 --> 00:20:20,930
Yes

352
00:20:20,940 --> 00:20:22,260
Very energetic!

353
00:20:22,270 --> 00:20:25,040
Oh - really? Thank you!

354
00:20:25,880 --> 00:20:29,690
This family has five generations together

355
00:20:31,330 --> 00:20:35,980
The eldest daughter is Nana and the youngest is Yui

356
00:20:36,610 --> 00:20:41,250
She is the child of a boyfriend I dated in her second year of high school

357
00:20:41,250 --> 00:20:43,820
This year she's five years old

358
00:20:43,820 --> 00:20:46,050
Are you married now?

359
00:20:46,090 --> 00:20:47,220
No

360
00:20:47,220 --> 00:20:51,860
After saying "I want to have a baby", I said "Let's break up then" and then we broke up

361
00:20:50,180 --> 00:20:51,960
Don't say that in front of the children!

362
00:20:52,200 --> 00:20:57,130
The day after the breakup, he got a new girlfriend

363
00:21:00,050 --> 00:21:01,570
Great-great-grandma is laughing!

364
00:21:01,190 --> 00:21:07,670
Nana, who gave birth to her eldest daughter unmarried at the age of 18 in her senior year of high school

365
00:21:08,230 --> 00:21:10,580
Different biological fathers

366
00:21:11,120 --> 00:21:18,300
Married to another man at the age of 19 and gave birth to Yuato, three years later she divorced

367
00:21:19,300 --> 00:21:21,950
So, Nana's mother

368
00:21:22,190 --> 00:21:24,630
This is my mom Asami

369
00:21:25,270 --> 00:21:29,120
Asami, grandmother of two at the age of 44

370
00:21:30,400 --> 00:21:32,900
Are you married, Asami?

371
00:21:33,140 --> 00:21:34,370
No...

372
00:21:34,370 --> 00:21:37,680
Ah, grandma too...
-Yeah

373
00:21:37,680 --> 00:21:39,910
Divorced once?
-Yes

374
00:21:41,270 --> 00:21:42,890
Great-great-grandmother's going again

375
00:21:43,010 --> 00:21:44,080
This is not the funny part!

376
00:21:44,010 --> 00:21:48,020
What happened?

377
00:21:48,020 --> 00:21:49,990
The discussion of divorce hit the funny bone?

378
00:21:50,240 --> 00:21:51,860
I'm sorry I laughed out loud

379
00:21:51,860 --> 00:21:55,130
Tears are coming out of my eyes

380
00:21:55,800 --> 00:21:59,900
The Yoshida family, including the great-grandmother who has no history of divorce

381
00:22:01,240 --> 00:22:06,010
Each of the five generations in the same family had their first born very early

382
00:22:06,190 --> 00:22:07,190
（Great-great-grandmother）20-years old

383
00:22:07,230 --> 00:22:09,120
（Great-grand mother）Also 20-years old

384
00:22:10,580 --> 00:22:11,650
(Grandmother) Also 20 years old

385
00:22:11,970 --> 00:22:13,550
(Mother) 17 years old

386
00:22:14,790 --> 00:22:17,720
Pretty much as close as possible

387
00:22:18,320 --> 00:22:24,230
The Yoshida family, which has been passing down the family line with high frequency, will have these four people out on the relay

388
00:22:25,800 --> 00:22:28,830
Next is Osaka Prefecture

389
00:22:29,910 --> 00:22:32,470
The second group of four families participating in the competition are

390
00:22:34,400 --> 00:22:35,200
Hello

391
00:22:35,730 --> 00:22:36,280
Hello

392
00:22:37,330 --> 00:22:38,510
The Murakami Family

393
00:22:40,620 --> 00:22:45,270
Mom, Rinka, 20, and only daughter, Sera, 2

394
00:22:46,370 --> 00:22:49,120
This is my mother Ayano

395
00:22:49,140 --> 00:22:51,540
Grandma Setsuko

396
00:22:52,200 --> 00:22:54,650
Sister Misaki

397
00:22:55,300 --> 00:22:57,210
Sister Kia

398
00:22:57,550 --> 00:23:00,890
Was Sera born when you were 18?

399
00:23:01,160 --> 00:23:02,290
Marriage necessitated by an unplanned pregnancy

400
00:23:02,290 --> 00:23:03,090
Marriage necessitated by an unplanned pregnancy

401
00:23:04,090 --> 00:23:05,660
Marriage necessitated by an unplanned pregnancy~

402
00:23:05,800 --> 00:23:07,630
Are you still married?

403
00:23:07,630 --> 00:23:11,700
Now it's... over

404
00:23:10,450 --> 00:23:12,240
Is it always like this?

405
00:23:12,830 --> 00:23:15,620
She got pregnant with Sera during the second year of high school

406
00:23:17,880 --> 00:23:22,620
A year after the senior year, she gave birth to a child and got divorced just 2 years after

407
00:23:23,730 --> 00:23:26,810
Similarly, her mother Ayano, is also

408
00:23:27,620 --> 00:23:29,820
Are you married now?

409
00:23:29,820 --> 00:23:33,720
At the moment, nothing

410
00:23:33,720 --> 00:23:37,490
Divorced once?
-Yes

411
00:23:37,490 --> 00:23:40,430
Eh? Everyone laughed out loud!

412
00:23:40,430 --> 00:23:41,870
It's fine

413
00:23:42,550 --> 00:23:45,810
But when pressed by the staff who noticed something different

414
00:23:46,680 --> 00:23:49,610
In fact, she's been divorced twice

415
00:23:50,370 --> 00:23:54,710
Slow down when you lie

416
00:23:54,710 --> 00:23:56,980
It's hard to admit

417
00:23:57,990 --> 00:24:02,280
The Murakami family also face the topic of divorce with a smile and cheerfulness

418
00:24:03,620 --> 00:24:08,180
Great-grandmother Setsuko, who has also been divorced twice, is 69 years old

419
00:24:08,760 --> 00:24:10,530
Grandma is in high demand now

420
00:24:10,790 --> 00:24:17,100
She recently dated and broke up with a 72-year-old guy

421
00:24:17,100 --> 00:24:18,300
Really?

422
00:24:18,920 --> 00:24:23,080
Setsuko has recently broken up with her boyfriend 3 times

423
00:24:24,220 --> 00:24:25,920
How did they meet?

424
00:24:26,380 --> 00:24:30,510
He picked me up while shopping in the supermarket

425
00:24:32,780 --> 00:24:35,190
Then we went to karaoke

426
00:24:35,290 --> 00:24:37,250
Too frivolous? Is it okay to say?

427
00:24:37,250 --> 00:24:38,120
She's already very frivolous

428
00:24:38,320 --> 00:24:40,410
Who are you talking about? Tanaka

429
00:24:40,410 --> 00:24:41,420
Tanaka?

430
00:24:41,530 --> 00:24:43,260
Do you know about Tanaka?

431
00:24:43,260 --> 00:24:45,760
He took me to Disneyland

432
00:24:45,760 --> 00:24:48,000
Tanaka's treat

433
00:24:48,930 --> 00:24:53,330
These 4 members will participate in the relay race

434
00:24:55,400 --> 00:24:57,970
Next up is Hiroshima Prefecture

435
00:24:59,620 --> 00:25:02,560
The 3rd family in the competition is

436
00:25:03,500 --> 00:25:05,320
Hello

437
00:25:05,320 --> 00:25:06,010
Hello

438
00:25:06,830 --> 00:25:11,390
The Noike family, the 35-year old mother Akane

439
00:25:13,180 --> 00:25:15,550
Then let's introduce the family

440
00:25:16,430 --> 00:25:17,320
This is the eldest son

441
00:25:17,700 --> 00:25:18,900
Eh, son?

442
00:25:19,260 --> 00:25:20,050
16 years old

443
00:25:20,800 --> 00:25:22,700
Have you ever been told "your mother is so young"?

444
00:25:22,700 --> 00:25:23,870
It is often said

445
00:25:23,870 --> 00:25:28,670
I was told "Your mom is super cute" the other day

446
00:25:28,810 --> 00:25:31,100
This is the second son Keiji

447
00:25:31,640 --> 00:25:34,680
This is the third son Taizan

448
00:25:34,680 --> 00:25:39,290
Fourth child and fifth child

449
00:25:40,530 --> 00:25:43,430
A mother with a lot of children

450
00:25:44,320 --> 00:25:47,290
He's my first husband's child

451
00:25:47,520 --> 00:25:51,460
The rest are my current husband's

452
00:25:52,160 --> 00:25:57,630
Divorced three years after giving birth to the eldest son at the age of 19

453
00:25:58,640 --> 00:26:04,690
2 years later, she remarried her current husband, Masao

454
00:26:05,880 --> 00:26:09,690
And they had four children

455
00:26:12,250 --> 00:26:15,250
Masao's children start with the second child

456
00:26:16,660 --> 00:26:21,490
After divulging the fact that only the eldest son's father is different

457
00:26:21,830 --> 00:26:23,630
The children are embarrassed

458
00:26:23,730 --> 00:26:25,760
They didn't know their father's aren't the same

459
00:26:25,760 --> 00:26:28,130
I see...

460
00:26:28,620 --> 00:26:31,230
Really?

461
00:26:31,470 --> 00:26:35,370
She's gonna bring this up now?

462
00:26:35,610 --> 00:26:38,880
Are you making it public now?

463
00:26:38,880 --> 00:26:40,580
Thought it was a good opportunity

464
00:26:40,910 --> 00:26:43,310
I'm nervous

465
00:26:43,980 --> 00:26:50,400
After disclosing the secret to the four children without any reservation

466
00:26:44,410 --> 00:26:47,320
This is not the time for a relay

467
00:26:51,720 --> 00:26:53,500
We return to introducing the family

468
00:26:54,380 --> 00:26:56,820
This is Mom Ayumi - 53 years old

469
00:26:58,200 --> 00:27:02,280
This is Ayumi, who has five grandchildren at the age of 53

470
00:27:03,050 --> 00:27:05,440
Initially married at the age of 16

471
00:27:05,640 --> 00:27:07,900
It wasn't marriage for necessity?

472
00:27:07,900 --> 00:27:08,510
No

473
00:27:08,510 --> 00:27:12,310
The dowry was paid and the marriage ceremony took place in a normal manner

474
00:27:13,030 --> 00:27:19,220
The ultra-rare model of getting married without being pregnant

475
00:27:19,220 --> 00:27:20,890
What is this BGM?

476
00:27:20,890 --> 00:27:23,840
Then at the age of 18, she gave birth to Akane

477
00:27:23,840 --> 00:27:25,160
This one too

478
00:27:25,490 --> 00:27:30,530
While together they had three children, but their marriage lasted only 10 years

479
00:27:33,560 --> 00:27:34,550
This is my daughter

480
00:27:36,820 --> 00:27:42,320
After that year, she remarried and had a daughter, Aoi, with her current husband

481
00:27:43,400 --> 00:27:47,460
The age difference between her and her eldest daughter Akane is 20 years

482
00:27:48,500 --> 00:27:49,780
In other words

483
00:27:50,110 --> 00:27:52,150
She's my aunt

484
00:27:53,050 --> 00:27:56,860
The aunt is younger than the nephew

485
00:27:58,150 --> 00:27:58,760
And then there is...

486
00:27:58,860 --> 00:28:00,680
Kazuko, 78 years old

487
00:28:04,570 --> 00:28:08,470
Great-grandmother feels uneasy about running because of her advanced age

488
00:28:09,200 --> 00:28:11,740
He's in athletics

489
00:28:11,740 --> 00:28:13,570
How long can you do the 100 metres in?

490
00:28:13,570 --> 00:28:17,140
12.4 seconds or so

491
00:28:16,300 --> 00:28:16,840
So fast!

492
00:28:17,520 --> 00:28:22,290
So the first participant is super fast and the last batter is the oldest of all

493
00:28:23,050 --> 00:28:26,160
Thus, the following family members will participate in the relay race

494
00:28:27,660 --> 00:28:31,790
The fourth group is also from Osaka Prefecture

495
00:28:31,020 --> 00:28:33,790
The first person will have a big lead, right?

496
00:28:34,860 --> 00:28:35,900
The Yamaoka family

497
00:28:37,490 --> 00:28:41,360
Pregnant at age 18 and born at age 19

498
00:28:42,050 --> 00:28:44,500
This is Churisa's mother, Mika-san

499
00:28:45,400 --> 00:28:49,910
I was 16 when I got pregnant and gave birth at 17

500
00:28:50,510 --> 00:28:54,810
Surrounded by super opposition

501
00:28:53,920 --> 00:28:55,210
Looks like a bad girl

502
00:28:55,280 --> 00:29:00,750
My relationship with my mother was very bad at that time

503
00:28:55,660 --> 00:28:56,940
Probably all are

504
00:29:00,770 --> 00:29:01,010
Really?

505
00:29:01,370 --> 00:29:01,990
Yes

506
00:29:03,170 --> 00:29:08,120
And this is Mika's mother, who is now very close to her

507
00:29:08,280 --> 00:29:08,900
How old are you?

508
00:29:08,900 --> 00:29:09,920
64

509
00:29:12,760 --> 00:29:16,310
The Yamaoka family has a unique quality

510
00:29:17,630 --> 00:29:22,350
Dad and mom always stick together, they're super in love

511
00:29:22,510 --> 00:29:25,210
They're always together

512
00:29:25,410 --> 00:29:29,880
Even if Dad goes to adult places

513
00:29:29,880 --> 00:29:31,210
Mum will go too

514
00:29:31,210 --> 00:29:33,880
Also known as "fancy" places

515
00:29:33,880 --> 00:29:34,890
Eh?

516
00:29:34,890 --> 00:29:37,590
"I'd like to go to the fancy place..." or something like that

517
00:29:37,820 --> 00:29:39,820
"Be careful"

518
00:29:39,820 --> 00:29:41,420
You really don't care

519
00:29:41,420 --> 00:29:45,000
It's better than him having a mistress, right?

520
00:29:45,000 --> 00:29:47,760
Eh, you also go together?

521
00:29:47,760 --> 00:29:49,300
Yes, outside

522
00:29:49,300 --> 00:29:51,840
Eh, it's not outside, it's in a hotel...

523
00:29:51,840 --> 00:29:52,500
Ah, hotel?

524
00:29:52,500 --> 00:29:53,870
I book a room

525
00:29:54,640 --> 00:29:57,710
You wait behind the glass...

526
00:29:57,710 --> 00:29:58,340
Yes yes yes

527
00:29:58,860 --> 00:29:59,880
What kind of quarrel is this?

528
00:29:59,600 --> 00:30:05,430
The Yamaoka family, which has nothing to hide, has no divorces

529
00:30:05,430 --> 00:30:07,040
A Super Successful Family

530
00:30:08,440 --> 00:30:11,600
So the relay race is these 4 people

531
00:30:13,700 --> 00:30:14,790
And

532
00:30:14,870 --> 00:30:16,040
Hello!

533
00:30:16,040 --> 00:30:17,270
Hello!

534
00:30:17,630 --> 00:30:22,000
The Takahashi family here is also a 4 generation family

535
00:30:24,500 --> 00:30:26,000
In a beautiful living room

536
00:30:28,780 --> 00:30:30,330
There are beautiful mothers

537
00:30:30,900 --> 00:30:33,390
Have you ever been divorced?

538
00:30:33,580 --> 00:30:36,280
Never had one. The family is complete

539
00:30:36,760 --> 00:30:39,360
This is the beautiful family's composition

540
00:30:41,230 --> 00:30:44,420
These four members of the Takahashi family will participate in the competition

541
00:30:45,560 --> 00:30:48,090
Takahashi family, let's do it!

542
00:30:48,100 --> 00:30:49,270
Oh!

543
00:30:50,410 --> 00:30:55,870
The former winners great-grandmother's foot makes them unable to participate

544
00:30:56,770 --> 00:30:59,140
An unexpected medical suspension

545
00:31:00,360 --> 00:31:00,990
Also

546
00:31:01,730 --> 00:31:03,970
Because I can't shut my business

547
00:31:05,110 --> 00:31:09,540
The five-generation Yoshida family  will not be able to participate

548
00:31:10,880 --> 00:31:12,320
Sorry about that

549
00:31:13,780 --> 00:31:18,760
So this time the relay will be carried out by these four

550
00:31:19,660 --> 00:31:22,610
4 generations relay!

551
00:31:24,080 --> 00:31:25,470
Thank you for having us!

552
00:31:26,690 --> 00:31:28,500
It will be the same as last time

553
00:31:28,500 --> 00:31:34,850
Half laps of a 150m track will take place in this order

554
00:31:36,690 --> 00:31:42,970
Toward surpassing the Japanese record of 1:25 of the previously relay

555
00:31:44,040 --> 00:31:45,950
So, everything is ready

556
00:31:46,570 --> 00:31:50,830
First runners are Ryuya 1 year old, Seiya 2 years old, Yui 3 years old

557
00:31:51,520 --> 00:31:55,270
There is also the 16 year old member of the track and field club, Itsuki

558
00:31:56,410 --> 00:31:59,250
Which family will win in the end?

559
00:31:57,090 --> 00:31:57,990
Seriously...

560
00:32:01,270 --> 00:32:05,600
Families comprised of different generations will compete in a relay race

561
00:32:05,770 --> 00:32:08,140
Who will be the winner?

562
00:32:09,380 --> 00:32:11,810
All in position. Ready

563
00:32:17,190 --> 00:32:18,770
The Noike family shoots out ahead

564
00:32:21,180 --> 00:32:26,700
And in the blink of an eye, the 16-year-old hands over the baton to his 35-year-old mother

565
00:32:27,080 --> 00:32:28,390
An overwhelming lead

566
00:32:29,530 --> 00:32:32,210
Can the Noike family maintain their lead?

567
00:32:32,420 --> 00:32:35,240
The gap with the second place is now more than half a lap

568
00:32:36,460 --> 00:32:42,580
At this time the 3 year old finely hands over the baton to her mother

569
00:32:43,370 --> 00:32:47,860
The Noike family on the other hand have completed passing the baton to the 53-year old grandmother

570
00:32:48,440 --> 00:32:57,150
Who will be the first to pass the baton out of Seiya and Ryuya?

571
00:32:58,320 --> 00:32:59,160
So heart-warming!

572
00:32:59,290 --> 00:33:00,310
It's really heartwarming

573
00:33:01,000 --> 00:33:06,480
At this time, the baton of the Noike family is handed over to the 78-year-old great-grandmother

574
00:33:09,430 --> 00:33:10,710
Shockingly she's walking!

575
00:33:11,770 --> 00:33:16,350
Although the first batter is 16 years old, the last batter is a senior, can she keep up the pace?

576
00:33:17,270 --> 00:33:20,670
At this time the Murakami family hands its baton over to the 45-year-old grandmother

577
00:33:21,470 --> 00:33:23,720
The Noike family is walking to the finish!

578
00:33:24,170 --> 00:33:28,800
In second-place, the Takahashi family hands over the baton to their 75-year-old great-grandmother

579
00:33:29,890 --> 00:33:32,350
While the Noike family is still walking!

580
00:33:34,230 --> 00:33:34,610
So white

581
00:33:35,520 --> 00:33:36,130
Catching up!

582
00:33:36,300 --> 00:33:37,350
Pretty fast!

583
00:33:36,930 --> 00:33:38,470
The gap is gradually narrowing

584
00:33:38,540 --> 00:33:40,180
Can it be reversed?

585
00:33:41,820 --> 00:33:43,830
Ah, so powerful, so powerful

586
00:33:44,750 --> 00:33:45,990
Second place is visible!

587
00:33:46,720 --> 00:33:49,700
The Noike family are the winners!

588
00:33:57,340 --> 00:33:58,420
Not much difference with the second place

589
00:34:00,750 --> 00:34:01,290
So cute

590
00:34:01,290 --> 00:34:02,120
Hydrating so fast

591
00:34:02,310 --> 00:34:08,190
By the way, the time of the winning family was 1 second longer than that of the previous winner

592
00:34:08,590 --> 00:34:09,980
Thus, the crown stays where it is

593
00:34:09,980 --> 00:34:12,620
Just one second!

594
00:34:13,040 --> 00:34:13,930
Only 1 second difference

595
00:34:13,930 --> 00:34:16,460
You used the family composition chart again for this

596
00:34:17,500 --> 00:34:18,770
Yes, the family composition chart

597
00:34:18,770 --> 00:34:21,490
They said a lot of weird stuff

598
00:34:22,190 --> 00:34:23,100
Super messy

599
00:34:23,100 --> 00:34:28,210
How can I say it? Families that are not bound by the marriage system

600
00:34:28,450 --> 00:34:29,540
Very cheerful

601
00:34:29,760 --> 00:34:31,480
Lots of independent women

602
00:34:31,490 --> 00:34:33,220
Very strong indeed.
-Very strong

603
00:34:33,230 --> 00:34:34,790
Quite powerful

604
00:34:35,110 --> 00:34:37,890
We are looking for many more families with four generations together

605
00:34:38,490 --> 00:34:42,430
So if you think you can win, please contact our team

606
00:34:43,090 --> 00:34:44,590
Better be quick

607
00:34:44,590 --> 00:34:45,550
Indeed

608
00:34:45,550 --> 00:34:48,990
If you don't do it early, the last generation will be...

609
00:34:50,990 --> 00:34:58,010
Next is everybody's theories

610
00:34:58,010 --> 00:35:00,400
Tonight's presenter is

611
00:35:02,620 --> 00:35:05,220
Tamura Kenji!

612
00:35:07,590 --> 00:35:11,950
Previously we tested an air cannon with colorless air

613
00:35:11,950 --> 00:35:13,300
Everyone remembers, right?

614
00:35:13,300 --> 00:35:17,380
That was funny.
-Interesting

615
00:35:17,380 --> 00:35:21,870
This program struck gold with this

616
00:35:21,870 --> 00:35:24,530
It was something that had never been done before

617
00:35:24,530 --> 00:35:25,590
This time

618
00:35:25,590 --> 00:35:31,020
We've added the air cannon element to a popular segment of this program

619
00:35:31,020 --> 00:35:32,350
Oh

620
00:35:32,900 --> 00:35:35,050
The theory is:

621
00:35:35,400 --> 00:35:42,920
When getting hit by a colorless stinky air cannon while being criticized, you won't mention the stench

622
00:35:44,650 --> 00:35:47,690
What a mess

623
00:35:47,690 --> 00:35:50,900
There is no reason for people to have to be scolded

624
00:35:50,900 --> 00:35:55,220
There is no reason for people to have to smell something bad

625
00:35:55,220 --> 00:35:57,640
I'm curious about that stench

626
00:35:57,640 --> 00:36:00,160
What kind of smell is it? What the hell is it?

627
00:36:00,160 --> 00:36:03,370
It's a smell that doesn't exist in this world

628
00:36:06,310 --> 00:36:14,320
When getting hit by a colorless stinky air cannon while being criticized, you won't mention the stench

629
00:36:14,810 --> 00:36:21,110
This time, we recruited seniors and juniors from all walks of life

630
00:36:21,110 --> 00:36:23,370
However, when it comes to the power of the air cannon

631
00:36:23,370 --> 00:36:24,820
It's unavoidable, right?

632
00:36:24,690 --> 00:36:26,160
Oh wow, it stinks...

633
00:36:26,160 --> 00:36:27,830
This guy-

634
00:36:27,830 --> 00:36:28,380
I'm sorry...

635
00:36:28,380 --> 00:36:35,430
As before, the setup is conducted in secret

636
00:36:31,250 --> 00:36:33,600
Such a powerful stench

637
00:36:33,600 --> 00:36:36,450
And colorless

638
00:36:36,450 --> 00:36:43,990
First of all, the first group is rehearsing in a small theater

639
00:36:45,360 --> 00:36:49,800
Of course the target knows nothing

640
00:36:50,440 --> 00:36:54,590
So, the lecture beings instantly

641
00:36:54,890 --> 00:37:00,030
You're doing badly so you must be looking down at me or the play

642
00:37:00,030 --> 00:37:02,230
I don't get it

643
00:37:02,230 --> 00:37:04,530
And you say that you want to be an actor

644
00:37:04,530 --> 00:37:06,900
I really think you are very childish

645
00:37:07,140 --> 00:37:09,670
If the rehearsal is bad then the actual performance will be even worse

646
00:37:10,640 --> 00:37:12,010
Nothing good will happen

647
00:37:12,010 --> 00:37:14,580
If you don't work hard its impossible

648
00:37:15,110 --> 00:37:19,370
Once the target is suitably depressed

649
00:37:19,370 --> 00:37:22,640
The air cannon is launched for condolences

650
00:37:22,640 --> 00:37:24,200
Why do you have to use the air cannon to condole someone?

651
00:37:24,200 --> 00:37:25,690
What will happen?

652
00:37:28,590 --> 00:37:29,760
Are you motivated?

653
00:37:32,500 --> 00:37:33,560
What's going on?

654
00:37:43,800 --> 00:37:45,630
She swung away

655
00:37:47,020 --> 00:37:48,410
Next

656
00:37:48,710 --> 00:37:53,080
Is there something wrong?

657
00:37:53,080 --> 00:37:54,550
Nothing. Sorry

658
00:37:53,370 --> 00:37:55,620
It really stinks!

659
00:37:55,260 --> 00:37:58,770
She didn't shout "it stinks!"

660
00:37:59,520 --> 00:38:01,140
Same after this

661
00:38:01,140 --> 00:38:04,270
How about it? What do you think?

662
00:38:03,570 --> 00:38:05,970
Stop screwing around

663
00:38:08,530 --> 00:38:12,340
What's going on? What is it?

664
00:38:12,340 --> 00:38:13,170
What is it?

665
00:38:13,400 --> 00:38:15,710
Totally unfocused!

666
00:38:15,870 --> 00:38:17,410
Do you have something to say?

667
00:38:18,470 --> 00:38:21,410
She does have something to say

668
00:38:21,740 --> 00:38:26,580
But its tough to rule out the possibility that the seniors are emitting the stench

669
00:38:26,850 --> 00:38:29,420
What? What's wrong?

670
00:38:30,860 --> 00:38:33,850
A hellish experience

671
00:38:34,790 --> 00:38:37,300
We revealed the truth now

672
00:38:38,100 --> 00:38:39,650
Shocking

673
00:38:41,560 --> 00:38:44,900
What is this? What's going on?

674
00:38:45,070 --> 00:38:46,000
Does it stink?

675
00:38:46,000 --> 00:38:47,100
It stinks

676
00:38:47,740 --> 00:38:50,310
What is the smell? Will it cling to me?

677
00:38:50,310 --> 00:38:51,610
It stinks!

678
00:38:51,610 --> 00:38:54,780
It stinks!

679
00:38:55,540 --> 00:38:59,800
Next are male actors

680
00:39:00,470 --> 00:39:04,150
This group also starts the lecture immediately

681
00:39:04,620 --> 00:39:05,920
You want to be a lead actor?

682
00:39:06,090 --> 00:39:07,260
I'd love to

683
00:39:07,490 --> 00:39:08,830
Or don't you want to?
-I do

684
00:39:08,830 --> 00:39:09,530
Your voice is too small to hear

685
00:39:09,530 --> 00:39:10,860
I want to be the lead actor!

686
00:39:11,190 --> 00:39:13,330
Do you understand what I'm saying?

687
00:39:13,330 --> 00:39:14,760
What do you want to become?

688
00:39:14,760 --> 00:39:16,930
You want to be the lead actor, right?
-I want to be the lead actor

689
00:39:16,930 --> 00:39:19,840
If you want to be the lead actor, say it louder!

690
00:39:20,570 --> 00:39:22,970
I want to be the lead actor!

691
00:39:22,970 --> 00:39:24,670
Oh oh, a little louder

692
00:39:24,670 --> 00:39:28,080
I want to be the lead actor

693
00:39:26,100 --> 00:39:29,320
Then do it!
It's not like that, Hamada

694
00:39:29,320 --> 00:39:33,070
At the moment when the target is about to cry for real

695
00:39:33,380 --> 00:39:36,490
Condolences are sent from the air cannon

696
00:39:33,570 --> 00:39:38,230
Don't, he's crying

697
00:39:38,590 --> 00:39:40,150
Do you understand?

698
00:39:46,320 --> 00:39:51,500
He touches his nose to mask his disgust

699
00:39:51,610 --> 00:39:53,340
What a roundabout tactic!

700
00:39:53,340 --> 00:39:55,470
It's not like touching your nose is ever a good thing

701
00:39:56,310 --> 00:39:59,790
And he doesn't say "it stinks"

702
00:40:00,230 --> 00:40:01,770
The same is true for the following target

703
00:40:08,420 --> 00:40:12,050
Thank you for your magnificent words!

704
00:40:13,330 --> 00:40:15,490
Yeah, sorry

705
00:40:16,560 --> 00:40:18,110
Patience

706
00:40:18,490 --> 00:40:19,740
Next

707
00:40:20,380 --> 00:40:24,000
Everyone will put up with it

708
00:40:28,330 --> 00:40:30,220
Oh my God, don't do this

709
00:40:34,340 --> 00:40:35,510
He breathed in

710
00:40:38,820 --> 00:40:42,890
He's using his strength

711
00:40:42,890 --> 00:40:44,880
Obviously it stinks

712
00:40:45,480 --> 00:40:46,960
What an expression

713
00:40:46,920 --> 00:40:50,790
You have a strange look on your face. What's wrong?
-Nothing

714
00:40:52,960 --> 00:40:54,390
Patience

715
00:40:54,390 --> 00:40:59,000
The next verification is on an imitation artist

716
00:41:00,590 --> 00:41:03,120
Hamada is very fond of this kind of thing, right?

717
00:41:03,120 --> 00:41:06,310
He loves to watch people smell stinky things

718
00:41:07,340 --> 00:41:09,530
You've never smelled Hamada's farts, have you?

719
00:41:09,530 --> 00:41:12,590
They're incredible, a PM level of 3.5

720
00:41:13,910 --> 00:41:18,730
Next, condolences to the parody artist with the air cannon

721
00:41:19,340 --> 00:41:22,060
There is no way to talk about this

722
00:41:22,060 --> 00:41:24,580
It can only be posted on social media

723
00:41:26,200 --> 00:41:28,530
Do you have a new gag?
-No

724
00:41:28,530 --> 00:41:29,600
What?

725
00:41:29,600 --> 00:41:33,800
There are so many TV programs nowadays

726
00:41:33,800 --> 00:41:35,400
Trends change so quickly

727
00:41:35,400 --> 00:41:38,840
Are you aware?
-Yes, I am

728
00:41:39,110 --> 00:41:40,910
You notice but you're not coming up with any new gags?

729
00:41:43,260 --> 00:41:47,350
At the pain point of the lecture

730
00:41:47,820 --> 00:41:50,660
The next segment shows

731
00:41:50,690 --> 00:41:54,690
To be able to come to such an excellent place today

732
00:41:54,690 --> 00:41:57,560
Thanks, I'm Ayase

733
00:41:57,930 --> 00:41:59,020
Music Start

734
00:42:19,920 --> 00:42:23,520
Sorry, my throat is a little...

735
00:42:23,520 --> 00:42:25,290
My voice is a bit stranined

736
00:42:27,100 --> 00:42:29,290
She blames it on her throat

737
00:42:29,660 --> 00:42:31,290
Next up

738
00:42:34,360 --> 00:42:35,570
sa'TOSHI

739
00:42:48,140 --> 00:42:49,550
Very similar

740
00:43:08,160 --> 00:43:10,100
All laughing

741
00:43:13,240 --> 00:43:16,610
Not good, it's coming!

742
00:43:21,310 --> 00:43:24,110
What a mess, 3 hits!

743
00:43:39,220 --> 00:43:40,600
Until here

744
00:43:40,600 --> 00:43:45,690
Most people believe that the stench is caused by the fart of the seniors

745
00:43:45,690 --> 00:43:49,850
So the situation of not being able to say stink continues to develop

746
00:43:51,000 --> 00:43:52,490
Among them

747
00:43:55,510 --> 00:43:57,550
What do you think?

748
00:43:57,550 --> 00:43:59,150
What is your personal opinion?

749
00:43:59,450 --> 00:44:06,260
If I'm late, I'll keep the rest of the company waiting

750
00:44:06,260 --> 00:44:13,400
I'm trying hard to go to bed early, but haven't started acting yet

751
00:44:13,400 --> 00:44:15,330
It's not right for me to do so

752
00:44:19,400 --> 00:44:21,800
Are you listening to me?

753
00:44:21,800 --> 00:44:23,240
Stinks

754
00:44:24,480 --> 00:44:27,250
He said it!

755
00:44:28,110 --> 00:44:29,980
Stinks

756
00:44:34,400 --> 00:44:35,700
He said it

757
00:44:36,630 --> 00:44:38,510
Later

758
00:44:46,760 --> 00:44:50,170
Why do you keep touching your face, are you looking down on me?

759
00:44:50,930 --> 00:44:54,140
No, something stinks

760
00:44:55,500 --> 00:44:57,370
It's a little hard to talk

761
00:44:57,670 --> 00:45:02,110
I don't feel well

762
00:45:02,110 --> 00:45:04,350
I want to go to the toilet

763
00:45:04,680 --> 00:45:07,380
Why do you want to go to the bathroom when someone's talking to you

764
00:45:10,020 --> 00:45:12,720
Tummy is a little upset

765
00:45:13,560 --> 00:45:18,260
A junior who wants to get out quickly even by lying

766
00:45:19,580 --> 00:45:21,390
Next

767
00:45:23,330 --> 00:45:26,940
You're too stalkerish when you're drunk

768
00:45:26,940 --> 00:45:28,940
This is the iron rule of hosts, right?

769
00:45:28,940 --> 00:45:32,580
"Don't drink it yourself, let the guests drink it"

770
00:45:32,580 --> 00:45:34,640
Why can't you help it?

771
00:45:36,040 --> 00:45:41,050
What a scene!
-What is this scenario?

772
00:45:49,790 --> 00:45:50,930
What's going on?

773
00:45:55,510 --> 00:46:01,600
In summary
air cannons should be used carefully in larger spaces

774
00:46:02,350 --> 00:46:03,950
So interesting!

775
00:46:03,950 --> 00:46:06,100
The kid that said "stinks" so directly was great

776
00:46:06,100 --> 00:46:09,150
Yes.
-A no nonsense man

777
00:46:09,150 --> 00:46:12,710
Kids today are like that, right?
-Yeah.

778
00:46:12,710 --> 00:46:15,680
Should do it to someone like Jimmy who is super sensitive

779
00:46:15,680 --> 00:46:16,720
Yeah!

780
00:46:16,720 --> 00:46:19,060
Don't you want to see Jimmy's reaction?
-Yeah

781
00:46:19,060 --> 00:46:22,290
A little stink and he'll
-He'll probably throw up

782
00:46:22,290 --> 00:46:24,320
Probably will throw up

783
00:46:24,320 --> 00:46:25,540
Let's see

784
00:46:25,540 --> 00:46:29,140
Using the frequency of a Taiko drummer to launch is good

785
00:46:32,360 --> 00:46:36,040
Because of this, Jimmy's version has been recorded

786
00:46:36,750 --> 00:46:38,530
And will be released soon

787
00:46:39,280 --> 00:47:09,970
