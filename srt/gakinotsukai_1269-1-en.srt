00:00:00,910 --> 00:00:02,480
In tonight's Gaki no Tsukai,

2
00:00:01,410 --> 00:00:06,920
The members will make their ideal robot out of cardboard

3
00:00:02,480 --> 00:00:04,020
using cardboard,

4
00:00:04,020 --> 00:00:06,980
the 5 will make their ideal robot.

5
00:00:07,250 --> 00:00:10,860
License will be the moderators

6
00:00:08,120 --> 00:00:08,990
License will be the moderators.

7
00:00:08,990 --> 00:00:10,620
License will be the moderators.

8
00:00:10,620 --> 00:00:14,860
And Inomoto was meant to start off the program with the 'Title call.'

9
00:00:11,190 --> 00:00:17,860
Inomoto was meant to start with the 'Title Call...'

10
00:00:15,190 --> 00:00:18,060
Okay, we are going to start now.

11
00:00:16,860 --> 00:00:18,860
Ok, let's go.

12
00:00:17,760 --> 00:00:19,760
Let's go.

13
00:00:18,060 --> 00:00:21,060
5 seconds... 4... 3...

14
00:00:19,230 --> 00:00:20,900
That right there,

15
00:00:20,900 --> 00:00:22,400
with that "Stop talking, people" type of tone.

16
00:00:22,870 --> 00:00:24,800
The first annual Gaki no Tsukai ya Arahende

17
00:00:23,600 --> 00:00:23,870
Shit, he said it before me!!

18
00:00:23,870 --> 00:00:24,800
Shit, he said it before me!!

19
00:00:24,800 --> 00:00:27,800
Oh shit, I wasn't meant to say it.

20
00:00:25,340 --> 00:00:26,570
I'm meant to...

21
00:00:26,570 --> 00:00:29,610
He said it before me.

22
00:00:27,310 --> 00:00:28,610
And there it is!! God this is annoying!

23
00:00:28,710 --> 00:00:30,940
I'm done, I'm done

24
00:00:30,940 --> 00:00:33,940
See ya later!!

25
00:00:32,740 --> 00:00:34,380
It's because he didn't say anything!!

26
00:00:32,910 --> 00:00:37,720
For some reason, Hamada started off with the Title Call

27
00:00:34,380 --> 00:00:36,520
He didn't say anything!

28
00:00:36,150 --> 00:00:37,720
I can't do this

29
00:00:36,520 --> 00:00:38,750
Because he didn't say anything!

30
00:00:37,720 --> 00:00:40,720
His words are useless

31
00:00:38,750 --> 00:00:40,350
No no...

32
00:00:40,350 --> 00:00:41,690
What the hell do you mean 'his words are useless'

33
00:00:42,350 --> 00:00:45,350
So you're going to hog all the attention, huh?

34
00:00:43,560 --> 00:00:45,520
No no...

35
00:00:45,520 --> 00:00:48,320
It's not like that at all

36
00:00:46,590 --> 00:00:49,730
We don't get any of the good parts...

37
00:00:49,730 --> 00:00:51,560
I always do it,

38
00:00:51,560 --> 00:00:54,560
so it's like a habit, I'm sorry...

39
00:00:54,870 --> 00:00:57,870
You're so happy that we all find this funny, huh?

40
00:00:58,140 --> 00:01:01,100
Why would I??

41
00:00:59,240 --> 00:00:59,910
Just with this, he can afford to eat a lot

42
00:00:59,910 --> 00:01:02,910
Just with this, he can afford to eat a lot

43
00:01:03,080 --> 00:01:12,750
Make your own ideal robot

44
00:01:03,080 --> 00:01:12,750
Time available: 1 hour

45
00:01:03,080 --> 00:01:12,750
Using Cardboard

46
00:01:03,080 --> 00:01:21,690
My Robot is Number one!

47
00:01:03,080 --> 00:01:21,690
Ultimate Space Robot Fight!

48
00:01:03,340 --> 00:01:04,410
So

49
00:01:04,410 --> 00:01:06,080
Let us explain the rules

50
00:01:06,080 --> 00:01:10,420
This time, the 5 will use cardboard and have 1 hour

51
00:01:10,420 --> 00:01:12,750
to make their own ideal robot.

52
00:01:13,090 --> 00:01:21,690
They will do everything by themselves

53
00:01:13,750 --> 00:01:16,490
Using various cardboard sizes and other equipment,

54
00:01:16,490 --> 00:01:21,890
they will build and decorate the robot all by themselves.

55
00:01:22,190 --> 00:01:25,360
And at the end, have a Space Robot Fight

56
00:01:22,360 --> 00:01:28,700
Who's Space Robot will be the best!?

57
00:01:25,360 --> 00:01:28,530
Who's robot will be crowned the ultimate robot?

58
00:01:28,730 --> 00:01:31,600
You know, we drew a picture of a robot?

59
00:01:29,370 --> 00:01:33,870
Before building, each drew the robot they planned to build

60
00:01:31,600 --> 00:01:34,600
So we have to create the robot as we drew it?

61
00:01:33,910 --> 00:01:35,910
Well yeah

62
00:01:34,670 --> 00:01:37,410
That's why we drew it...

63
00:01:35,910 --> 00:01:38,910
Can we really make it?

64
00:01:40,610 --> 00:01:43,350
All you did was draw what you wanted to create

65
00:01:43,350 --> 00:01:46,320
I don't get how the drawing is getting you down...

66
00:01:47,790 --> 00:01:50,460
What's wrong?

67
00:01:48,690 --> 00:01:50,460
He's really looking confused...

68
00:01:50,460 --> 00:01:53,460
He was in such a good mood before

69
00:01:52,220 --> 00:01:53,020
No no no, I wasn't in a good mood...

70
00:01:53,020 --> 00:01:55,930
No no no, I wasn't in a good mood...

71
00:01:57,430 --> 00:02:01,930
Downtown's

72
00:01:58,760 --> 00:02:01,930
Gaki no Tsukai ya Arahende!!

00:02:08,340 --> 00:02:13,150
Make your own ideal robot

76
00:02:08,840 --> 00:02:09,470
In tonight's show, using cardboard

77
00:02:09,470 --> 00:02:10,640
In tonight's show, using cardboard

78
00:02:10,640 --> 00:02:13,150
they will create their own ideal robot

79
00:02:13,280 --> 00:02:16,150
and at the end, they will battle their robots

80
00:02:13,810 --> 00:02:19,150
Which Space Robot is the ultimate one!?

81
00:02:16,150 --> 00:02:19,150
Whose robot is the ultimate one?

82
00:02:19,650 --> 00:02:24,120
Building begins!

83
00:02:20,050 --> 00:02:21,750
They go into their own rooms and begin building

84
00:02:21,750 --> 00:02:24,120
They go into their own rooms and begin building

85
00:02:24,120 --> 00:02:32,560
4:29 PM - Start

86
00:02:24,290 --> 00:02:25,490
Right then

87
00:02:25,960 --> 00:02:27,330
I'm going to do this!

88
00:02:27,330 --> 00:02:30,330
We haven't got much time!

89
00:02:28,430 --> 00:02:31,430
You're right, time will be tough.

90
00:02:31,030 --> 00:02:32,560
That's true

91
00:02:33,530 --> 00:02:35,570
We only have 1 hour

92
00:02:35,570 --> 00:02:39,870
Did I really draw this illustration?

93
00:02:39,870 --> 00:02:41,870
I haven't a clue where to start...

94
00:02:42,210 --> 00:02:45,810
From the start, Hamada seems confused

95
00:02:42,710 --> 00:02:43,980
From the start

96
00:02:43,980 --> 00:02:45,840
Hamada seems confused

97
00:02:45,840 --> 00:02:46,780
We don't have as much time as I thought

98
00:02:46,780 --> 00:02:50,020
We don't have as much time as I thought

99
00:02:51,650 --> 00:02:56,290
Tanaka is worried about the lack of time

100
00:02:51,880 --> 00:02:56,290
Tanaka is worried about the lack of time

101
00:02:56,520 --> 00:02:58,020
How's it going?

102
00:02:57,090 --> 00:02:58,590
We're coming in...

103
00:02:57,490 --> 00:02:59,360
No, umm...

104
00:02:59,360 --> 00:03:01,530
I've got the image in my head

105
00:03:00,730 --> 00:03:01,530
Ok...

106
00:03:00,730 --> 00:03:01,530
Uhuh..

107
00:03:01,160 --> 00:03:01,590
like really well

108
00:03:01,590 --> 00:03:02,960
like really well

109
00:03:02,960 --> 00:03:04,300
But I'm also thinking we don't have much time

110
00:03:04,300 --> 00:03:06,260
But I'm also thinking we don't have much time

111
00:03:05,630 --> 00:03:06,260
I see, only 1 hour...

112
00:03:06,570 --> 00:03:07,430
How to say it...

113
00:03:07,430 --> 00:03:08,800
I don't want to feel it's incomplete

114
00:03:08,800 --> 00:03:11,770
I don't want to feel it's incomplete

115
00:03:11,340 --> 00:03:11,840
Yeah...

116
00:03:11,770 --> 00:03:13,570
like no matter what

117
00:03:12,500 --> 00:03:14,500
So you're worried about it being incomplete

118
00:03:13,570 --> 00:03:14,640
Yeah...

119
00:03:14,640 --> 00:03:16,310
I really want to avoid that but

120
00:03:16,310 --> 00:03:18,180
At this rate, it will definitely be incomplete

121
00:03:18,180 --> 00:03:21,850
At this rate, it will definitely be incomplete

122
00:03:19,910 --> 00:03:22,840
Wait, already?

123
00:03:20,850 --> 00:03:23,350
You already know? It's been 5 minutes...

124
00:03:22,510 --> 00:03:23,350
I know it after 5 minutes...

125
00:03:23,350 --> 00:03:25,320
But it's fine, I'll make it

126
00:03:25,320 --> 00:03:28,390
But it's fine, I'll make it

127
00:03:28,390 --> 00:03:31,390
4:39PM - 10 minutes in

128
00:03:28,990 --> 00:03:30,420
With the limited time they have

129
00:03:30,420 --> 00:03:33,690
Will they be able to make their ideal robot?

130
00:03:34,030 --> 00:03:38,630
Out of the 5, Hosei is the best at creating

131
00:03:34,260 --> 00:03:35,360
Out of the 5, Hosei is the most dextrous.

132
00:03:35,360 --> 00:03:37,130
Out of the 5, Hosei is the most dextrous.

133
00:03:37,130 --> 00:03:38,630
How confident is he...

134
00:03:38,860 --> 00:03:40,800
Probably, compared to the other guys

135
00:03:40,800 --> 00:03:42,470
I can make a different robot

136
00:03:42,470 --> 00:03:45,470
I can make a different robot

137
00:03:43,100 --> 00:03:43,900
I see

138
00:03:43,900 --> 00:03:46,840
You're right, he's building really quickly

139
00:03:45,370 --> 00:03:48,370
He's doing it as he speaks to us too

140
00:03:47,310 --> 00:03:49,940
Hang on, what's he doing, what you doing here?

141
00:03:49,340 --> 00:03:50,340
Wow wow...

142
00:03:50,140 --> 00:03:51,080
You do this

143
00:03:51,080 --> 00:03:52,880
make it soft and break the fibres

144
00:03:52,080 --> 00:03:53,880
breaking it in...

145
00:03:52,880 --> 00:03:54,510
make it soft and break the fibres

146
00:03:53,880 --> 00:03:56,880
Do you have to break it in?

147
00:03:55,150 --> 00:03:59,080
I guess he's thinking about the strength of the materials he's using...

148
00:04:01,150 --> 00:04:02,750
It didn't really do much...

149
00:04:02,750 --> 00:04:04,750
It didn't do much at all...

150
00:04:05,990 --> 00:04:07,360
You did that and put it there?..

151
00:04:07,360 --> 00:04:10,360
But it's getting there...

152
00:04:08,560 --> 00:04:10,700
Yeah, it is getting there...

153
00:04:11,360 --> 00:04:13,270
And Matsumoto...

154
00:04:11,360 --> 00:04:14,360
What kind of robot is he trying to make!?

155
00:04:13,270 --> 00:04:15,970
What kind of robot is he trying to make...

156
00:04:15,970 --> 00:04:17,970
Huh?

157
00:04:18,100 --> 00:04:19,300
Damn, that's big.

158
00:04:19,300 --> 00:04:21,040
It's huge!!

159
00:04:21,040 --> 00:04:24,040
Don't say "it's huge" so loud man...

160
00:04:24,310 --> 00:04:26,810
I haven't got time!!

161
00:04:25,840 --> 00:04:26,910
But if this...

162
00:04:26,910 --> 00:04:29,310
is just the arm, you're in serious trouble

163
00:04:29,310 --> 00:04:31,810
It's not just the arm though, right?

164
00:04:31,120 --> 00:04:34,250
No but seriously... I need an assistant or something...

165
00:04:35,250 --> 00:04:36,390
If things didn't go to plan, I would've probably lived in something like this, huh?

166
00:04:36,390 --> 00:04:40,990
If things didn't go to plan, I would've probably lived in something like this, huh?

167
00:04:41,660 --> 00:04:44,660
How is Hamada doing?

168
00:04:41,660 --> 00:04:45,130
Now the one we are most curious about, how is Hamada doing?..

169
00:04:45,430 --> 00:04:46,930
We're coming in...

170
00:04:47,570 --> 00:04:49,730
Don't look at him...

171
00:04:48,700 --> 00:04:51,000
We're sorry...

172
00:04:51,600 --> 00:04:54,210
What a psychotic-looking scene.

173
00:04:53,270 --> 00:04:56,270
Shit, shit, shit...

174
00:04:54,210 --> 00:04:57,310
That's a dangerous person...

175
00:04:57,310 --> 00:05:00,310
There's a serious psycho here.

176
00:05:00,680 --> 00:05:01,480
Hamada-san, so how is it all going?

177
00:05:01,480 --> 00:05:03,550
Hamada-san, so how is it all going?

178
00:05:03,550 --> 00:05:07,190
I've done this and not progressed at all since...

179
00:05:05,880 --> 00:05:08,820
You don't know what to do?

180
00:05:07,190 --> 00:05:11,190
It's like a newcomers break time...

181
00:05:11,290 --> 00:05:13,660
I was wondering how I would look in it...

182
00:05:13,660 --> 00:05:15,960
So I got in...

183
00:05:14,860 --> 00:05:15,560
So you've got in and just completely stopped

184
00:05:15,560 --> 00:05:18,560
So you've got in and just completely stopped

185
00:05:16,290 --> 00:05:19,660
Yep, exactly...

186
00:05:19,900 --> 00:05:23,030
Like literally, he cannot do anything right now...

187
00:05:22,400 --> 00:05:23,570
This is..

188
00:05:23,970 --> 00:05:29,440
Hamada is stuck

189
00:05:24,540 --> 00:05:26,770
Hamada is already stuck

190
00:05:25,600 --> 00:05:29,440
what will happen now!?

191
00:05:26,770 --> 00:05:29,440
What will happen now?

192
00:05:29,440 --> 00:05:32,440
20 minutes since the start

193
00:05:30,580 --> 00:05:32,840
Unusually, they all have serious faces on...

194
00:05:32,840 --> 00:05:35,380
they are absorbed with their projects

195
00:05:35,380 --> 00:05:40,620
You stop talking... Like you can't keep talking whilst you're doing this...

196
00:05:40,620 --> 00:05:43,620
30 minutes since the start

197
00:05:41,120 --> 00:05:42,550
Everyone...

198
00:05:42,490 --> 00:05:43,490
Yep...

199
00:05:42,550 --> 00:05:45,550
30 minutes has passed

200
00:05:44,260 --> 00:05:45,260
What?

201
00:05:44,790 --> 00:05:47,920
What,
already 30 minutes

202
00:05:46,220 --> 00:05:47,430
We are at the half-way point.

203
00:05:47,430 --> 00:05:48,960
Please do your best

204
00:05:50,760 --> 00:05:53,960
To make their ideal cardboard robots...

205
00:05:54,570 --> 00:05:57,700
they just carry on building...

206
00:06:01,110 --> 00:06:06,510
Will they be able to make their ideal robots?

207
00:06:01,910 --> 00:06:03,010
Will they

208
00:06:03,010 --> 00:06:04,740
be able to

209
00:06:04,740 --> 00:06:06,510
make their ideal robots?

210
00:06:06,810 --> 00:06:09,680
I think it's going well

211
00:06:07,580 --> 00:06:08,580
Oh really?

212
00:06:10,350 --> 00:06:11,350
Amazing

213
00:06:12,020 --> 00:06:13,520
That's awesome

214
00:06:12,880 --> 00:06:15,850
You've only got 20 minutes though, you know?

215
00:06:14,190 --> 00:06:16,190
Yeah, I'm not going to make it, seriously...

216
00:06:16,190 --> 00:06:17,860
Yeah, I'm not going to make it, seriously...

217
00:06:17,860 --> 00:06:19,060
I really don't think I will have enough time...

218
00:06:19,820 --> 00:06:21,290
And then...

219
00:06:21,290 --> 00:06:23,790
I wanted a bigger one but...

220
00:06:24,130 --> 00:06:27,130
do it like this and...

221
00:06:26,130 --> 00:06:28,130
Damn that's scary!

222
00:06:26,400 --> 00:06:28,400
Scary!

223
00:06:28,630 --> 00:06:31,630
The face is so scary!

224
00:06:30,000 --> 00:06:32,440
Why? It's not that scary...

225
00:06:32,440 --> 00:06:35,440
10 minutes remain

226
00:06:33,200 --> 00:06:35,540
Only 10 minutes remain

227
00:06:35,540 --> 00:06:38,240
The final push to make their ideal robots...

228
00:06:38,880 --> 00:06:41,250
It's completely different to my idea...

229
00:06:41,250 --> 00:06:42,880
I guess it isn't as easy as I thought it would be.

230
00:06:44,880 --> 00:06:46,180
I think it looks good.

231
00:06:47,850 --> 00:06:49,650
Okay...

232
00:06:49,650 --> 00:06:51,160
Okay okay...

233
00:06:51,160 --> 00:06:52,120
It's good..

234
00:06:52,460 --> 00:06:58,560
Did they make the ultimate robot!?

235
00:06:53,090 --> 00:06:56,530
Some of them are confident, others a bit concerned...

236
00:06:56,530 --> 00:06:58,560
Were they able to make the ultimate robot?

237
00:07:01,530 --> 00:07:02,500
Okay, it's done

238
00:07:02,500 --> 00:07:03,270
Okay, it's done

239
00:07:03,470 --> 00:07:06,270
Damn, that was hard work though

240
00:07:05,440 --> 00:07:08,600
Time is up!

241
00:07:07,370 --> 00:07:08,910
Great job, guys!

242
00:07:08,940 --> 00:07:13,080
Right then, let's get you all to come out one by one.

243
00:07:13,450 --> 00:07:20,080
Tanaka's robot

244
00:07:13,450 --> 00:07:20,080
step forward

245
00:07:14,350 --> 00:07:17,580
Let's get them now to show us their finished robots!

246
00:07:17,580 --> 00:07:20,080
First up, Tanaka's robot

247
00:07:20,390 --> 00:07:25,390
Tanaka-san's robot: Vehicle Warfare Trans T.

248
00:07:25,920 --> 00:07:35,050
Vehicle Warfare Trans T

249
00:07:26,160 --> 00:07:29,160
What was that?

250
00:07:27,430 --> 00:07:30,430
Trans T?

251
00:07:29,360 --> 00:07:32,460
It's a pretty rubbish name...

252
00:07:39,740 --> 00:07:41,740
The emblem fell off...

253
00:07:41,170 --> 00:07:43,170
The most important part..

254
00:07:43,340 --> 00:07:46,480
Stick it on for me...

255
00:07:44,810 --> 00:07:46,480
It's just hanging on...

256
00:07:46,480 --> 00:07:48,850
It's like a clock on a wall.

257
00:07:48,910 --> 00:07:51,920
Of course it'll fall off then...

258
00:07:50,880 --> 00:07:53,080
But that's an important part of your robot, right?

259
00:07:51,920 --> 00:07:53,080
Yes

260
00:07:53,080 --> 00:07:59,420
I am a Transformer kind of robot, it's in style now. I know, and you probably know this already.

261
00:07:59,420 --> 00:08:04,100
I have four tires so I usually move around as a vehicle

262
00:08:01,360 --> 00:08:06,800
Can transform into a car

263
00:08:04,100 --> 00:08:06,800
and then I transform and become this robot

264
00:08:06,800 --> 00:08:12,800
The biggest thing to note is this steering wheel on my chest...

265
00:08:11,240 --> 00:08:14,470
Oh, so that's a steering wheel huh...

266
00:08:13,240 --> 00:08:15,670
This can rotate

267
00:08:15,010 --> 00:08:17,010
Oh wow

268
00:08:15,670 --> 00:08:16,470
Yeah...

269
00:08:16,470 --> 00:08:17,680
And out of this...

270
00:08:17,680 --> 00:08:19,010
It releases an amazing ultrasonic sound

271
00:08:19,010 --> 00:08:21,150
It releases an amazing ultrasonic sound

272
00:08:21,150 --> 00:08:24,380
It's a really nasty ultrasonic sound

273
00:08:22,750 --> 00:08:25,710
Oh, for people?

274
00:08:24,380 --> 00:08:26,990
So it will stop the enemy from being able to move

275
00:08:24,850 --> 00:08:29,690
The ultrasonic sound stops the movements of the enemy

276
00:08:26,990 --> 00:08:29,990
And that's when I get this...

277
00:08:30,320 --> 00:08:32,190
when I've transformed...

278
00:08:32,190 --> 00:08:34,830
And this is...

279
00:08:33,960 --> 00:08:35,490
Oh he didn't accidentally rip it, they break apart.

280
00:08:34,830 --> 00:08:35,490
Yes

281
00:08:35,530 --> 00:08:37,630
This is what you do

282
00:08:37,630 --> 00:08:39,660
This is what you do

283
00:08:38,660 --> 00:08:41,660
Ohh, it becomes your sword?

284
00:08:38,700 --> 00:08:42,970
The steering wheel on the chest becomes a weapon

285
00:08:39,660 --> 00:08:40,860
Yes

286
00:08:41,200 --> 00:08:42,970
Oh but seriously

287
00:08:42,970 --> 00:08:43,540
surely...

288
00:08:43,540 --> 00:08:44,640
Wouldn't it be better to use the ultrasonic thing the whole time?

289
00:08:44,640 --> 00:08:47,570
Wouldn't it be better to use the ultrasonic thing the whole time?

290
00:08:46,140 --> 00:08:48,140
Yeah...

291
00:08:47,570 --> 00:08:50,570
Because it can get everyone, there's no reason to make it into a sword...

292
00:08:50,580 --> 00:08:52,810
There's no reason for it

293
00:08:51,440 --> 00:08:52,810
It's for close range combat

294
00:08:52,810 --> 00:08:54,380
I'm a close range combat robot

295
00:08:54,380 --> 00:08:57,180
I'm a close range combat robot

296
00:08:55,810 --> 00:08:57,250
But before you have to go close range...

297
00:08:57,250 --> 00:09:00,250
Why don't you use that radio wave thing...

298
00:08:59,620 --> 00:09:02,920
The radio wave is only used to stop the enemy from moving

299
00:09:03,220 --> 00:09:05,820
And can you see the V on my forehead?

300
00:09:05,820 --> 00:09:09,320
This is a wiper

301
00:09:09,190 --> 00:09:11,190
Oh I see...

302
00:09:10,360 --> 00:09:14,830
No it's not V for victory...

303
00:09:14,830 --> 00:09:17,770
It releases another ultrasonic sound...

304
00:09:16,730 --> 00:09:18,730
Damn you release a lot of ultrasonic sounds...

305
00:09:18,070 --> 00:09:19,570
Right?

306
00:09:18,540 --> 00:09:24,680
The wiper also releases an ultrasonic sound

307
00:09:20,070 --> 00:09:24,680
This is quite an aggressive ultrasonic sound so will just...

308
00:09:24,780 --> 00:09:26,510
and the belt...

309
00:09:26,510 --> 00:09:29,310
can you see the black circle?

310
00:09:29,380 --> 00:09:31,220
This is the horn

311
00:09:31,220 --> 00:09:32,350
and so

312
00:09:32,350 --> 00:09:35,620
when you push this, it will just shoot at the enemy.

313
00:09:35,820 --> 00:09:40,630
The horn stops the enemy's movements

314
00:09:35,890 --> 00:09:37,920
Damn, he loves stopping the enemy's movements.

315
00:09:38,120 --> 00:09:40,920
If he could actually become a car from this, that would be amazing

316
00:09:40,530 --> 00:09:42,530
Yeah, if he actually did it now...

317
00:09:41,260 --> 00:09:44,260
If you started as a car and then transformed into that then it would be amazing

318
00:09:43,230 --> 00:09:45,730
Oh yeah, that would be amazing

319
00:09:46,200 --> 00:09:49,200
Haha, look at him... Won't say a word.

320
00:09:49,030 --> 00:09:52,530
Maybe you can do it if you bend down and stuff...

321
00:09:50,770 --> 00:09:52,040
Yeah, try doing it

322
00:09:51,370 --> 00:09:53,100
I thought you could do it...

323
00:09:52,040 --> 00:09:53,810
Go on, try doing it

324
00:09:53,100 --> 00:09:55,710
I thought you would be able to

325
00:09:53,810 --> 00:09:56,940
I can't see it as a car otherwise

326
00:09:55,710 --> 00:09:59,510
You should be able to transform like...

327
00:09:59,810 --> 00:10:00,610
*pop*

328
00:10:02,650 --> 00:10:05,680
Give us a minute...

329
00:10:04,080 --> 00:10:07,080
The belt made a huge sound

330
00:10:06,650 --> 00:10:08,750
It just suddenly broke

331
00:10:08,320 --> 00:10:10,320
Give us a second...

332
00:10:08,850 --> 00:10:11,390
I think a poo came out...

333
00:10:11,390 --> 00:10:12,990
I honestly thought a poo came out...

334
00:10:12,990 --> 00:10:22,000
Can transform into a car

335
00:10:12,990 --> 00:10:22,000
Steering wheel on chest becomes a weapon

336
00:10:12,990 --> 00:10:22,000
Stops movement with ultrasonic sound

337
00:10:12,990 --> 00:10:22,000
The horn stops the enemy's movements

338
00:10:12,990 --> 00:10:22,000
Trans T

339
00:10:12,990 --> 00:10:22,000
Vehicle warfare

340
00:10:12,990 --> 00:10:22,000
Wiper also produces ultrasonic sound

341
00:10:13,860 --> 00:10:16,590
Vehicle Warfare: Trans T

342
00:10:16,590 --> 00:10:22,000
It stops and defeats the enemy with its ultrasonic sound, a transformer robot!

343
00:10:22,370 --> 00:10:28,970
Hosei's robot

344
00:10:22,370 --> 00:10:28,970
Step forward

345
00:10:22,900 --> 00:10:27,140
Next up is the very confident Hosei's cardboard robot.

346
00:10:27,140 --> 00:10:28,970
And its name is...

347
00:10:29,240 --> 00:10:32,240
Julia, step forward!

348
00:10:32,010 --> 00:10:40,990
Julia

349
00:10:45,290 --> 00:10:48,460
Julia...

350
00:10:46,290 --> 00:10:47,930
Here comes Julia..

351
00:10:47,930 --> 00:10:49,930
Out comes Julia...

352
00:10:49,660 --> 00:10:52,260
This is amazing...

353
00:10:50,960 --> 00:10:52,960
It's a tank robot...

354
00:10:52,360 --> 00:10:55,430
There's a dog behind it as well...

355
00:10:53,630 --> 00:10:56,830
He's brought a dog?

356
00:10:55,930 --> 00:10:58,240
Wait, that's a dog?

357
00:10:57,300 --> 00:10:59,340
I think it is...

358
00:10:58,440 --> 00:11:01,570
It was lying on its face...

359
00:10:59,340 --> 00:11:01,740
Oh I see, it fell over...

360
00:11:01,740 --> 00:11:05,180
*Casshan is an anime series created by Tatsunoko Productions in 1973.

361
00:11:01,740 --> 00:11:05,180
I see, it's a dog robot, like in Casshan*.

362
00:11:05,110 --> 00:11:07,110
Yeah...

363
00:11:05,880 --> 00:11:06,610
That's right.

364
00:11:06,610 --> 00:11:08,310
So this

365
00:11:08,310 --> 00:11:10,880
Julia is REALLY heavy...

366
00:11:10,420 --> 00:11:16,090
Very heavy

367
00:11:10,880 --> 00:11:13,420
It has so much weight

368
00:11:13,420 --> 00:11:16,090
that it loses its energy really quickly.

369
00:11:16,090 --> 00:11:20,120
and if you can all go behind me, there is a SOS...

370
00:11:20,120 --> 00:11:22,120
Oh yeah, it says SOS here...

371
00:11:22,360 --> 00:11:23,330
SOS, yep...

372
00:11:23,230 --> 00:11:24,060
So this

373
00:11:24,060 --> 00:11:25,400
So when it's out of fuel, that starts to flicker

374
00:11:25,400 --> 00:11:27,370
So when it's out of fuel, that starts to flicker

375
00:11:26,360 --> 00:11:29,360
The SOS?

376
00:11:27,400 --> 00:11:30,300
Yes, it flickers a lot and the dog understands that

377
00:11:30,300 --> 00:11:33,600
and the dog will come and help me

378
00:11:33,600 --> 00:11:36,370
And when the dog comes to help me...

379
00:11:33,770 --> 00:11:41,580
The dog robot helps Julia when it runs out of fuel

380
00:11:36,370 --> 00:11:39,510
It gives Julia a hell of a lot of energy

381
00:11:39,510 --> 00:11:42,610
And when it gives me that energy

382
00:11:42,610 --> 00:11:46,150
This is my final secret weapon... You can see it says 'Danger'

383
00:11:47,390 --> 00:11:48,450
From here...

384
00:11:48,450 --> 00:11:50,450
It can give a mega punch

385
00:11:52,590 --> 00:11:55,790
The punch goes downwards...

386
00:11:53,590 --> 00:11:58,600
A mega punch comes out of the chest

387
00:11:54,660 --> 00:11:57,660
That's quite cool...

388
00:11:55,790 --> 00:11:58,600
It's fine it came out but it won't go back in...

389
00:11:58,760 --> 00:12:00,260
Julia's

390
00:12:00,260 --> 00:12:03,070
weapon are these...

391
00:12:02,700 --> 00:12:03,700
The attack?..

392
00:12:03,070 --> 00:12:03,670
Yes...

393
00:12:03,270 --> 00:12:06,270
This is a missile

394
00:12:05,100 --> 00:12:06,500
Oh, it's a missile is it?

395
00:12:06,270 --> 00:12:09,500
It's covered in deadly poisonous lacquer.

396
00:12:08,640 --> 00:12:11,440
lacquer??

397
00:12:09,610 --> 00:12:11,440
It's got lacquer on it?

398
00:12:11,610 --> 00:12:13,750
It has lacquer all over it?..

399
00:12:11,610 --> 00:12:17,280
Has missiles covered in poisonous lacquer

400
00:12:13,750 --> 00:12:16,010
That's not something

401
00:12:16,010 --> 00:12:17,510
A robot...

402
00:12:19,720 --> 00:12:22,750
Please do not kick it, please do not kick his robot.

403
00:12:21,920 --> 00:12:25,220
It's his loving dog after all.

404
00:12:23,190 --> 00:12:26,220
It's my loving dog.

405
00:12:24,890 --> 00:12:28,390
It doesn't look like it's got no stability. What's this thing called by the way?

406
00:12:27,490 --> 00:12:29,430
This is Roberts

407
00:12:29,430 --> 00:12:31,260
So we are Julia Roberts...

408
00:12:31,500 --> 00:12:32,500
If you hadn't told me just now I would have NEVER known

409
00:12:32,500 --> 00:12:34,430
If you hadn't told me just now I would have NEVER known

410
00:12:34,600 --> 00:12:37,240
It's a girl, my robot itself is a girl

411
00:12:37,400 --> 00:12:42,970
It's a girl

412
00:12:37,700 --> 00:12:40,700
I don't get why it's a girl...

413
00:12:39,340 --> 00:12:40,100
Yeah, it's a girl

414
00:12:40,100 --> 00:12:44,100
So this is the boob...

415
00:12:43,210 --> 00:12:45,410
Oh that's the boob?

416
00:12:45,510 --> 00:12:47,410
But...

417
00:12:47,410 --> 00:12:51,550
I didn't think this part was so thin...

418
00:12:51,220 --> 00:12:53,220
Oh really?

419
00:12:51,550 --> 00:12:54,580
So my neck right now is just...

420
00:12:54,020 --> 00:12:56,020
Oh this?

421
00:12:56,450 --> 00:12:58,950
I'm actually looking this way...

422
00:12:58,460 --> 00:13:00,460
Oh, are you?

423
00:12:58,860 --> 00:13:04,360
The body is narrow so he can't move very well

424
00:12:59,720 --> 00:13:02,260
So when the robot faces forward, your head faces us?

425
00:13:01,030 --> 00:13:03,930
It's like that magic trick

426
00:13:04,460 --> 00:13:07,460
His body faces one way and his face faces another..

427
00:13:06,960 --> 00:13:08,330
Damn, Julia has it tough

428
00:13:08,330 --> 00:13:17,340
Has a dog robot come with it

429
00:13:08,330 --> 00:13:17,340
Has missiles covered in poisonous lacquer

430
00:13:08,330 --> 00:13:17,340
Julia

431
00:13:08,330 --> 00:13:17,340
Mega punch from the chest

432
00:13:08,330 --> 00:13:17,340
The body is so narrow it can't move very well

433
00:13:08,330 --> 00:13:17,340
and Roberts

434
00:13:09,200 --> 00:13:11,300
Julia Roberts!

435
00:13:11,300 --> 00:13:14,270
Comes with a dog robot who helps the robot out

436
00:13:14,270 --> 00:13:17,340
It defeats the enemies with its missiles covered in poisonous lacquer

437
00:13:17,710 --> 00:13:24,220
Endo's robot

438
00:13:17,710 --> 00:13:24,220
Step forward

439
00:13:18,140 --> 00:13:21,210
Next up is Endo's cardboard robot

440
00:13:21,210 --> 00:13:24,220
He has emphasised one part of the robot

441
00:13:24,320 --> 00:13:27,820
It's a defence robot, Bariaan, step foward!

442
00:13:28,190 --> 00:13:31,320
A defence robot?

443
00:13:28,390 --> 00:13:37,030
Defence robot: Bariaan

444
00:13:31,890 --> 00:13:33,890
So it just defends?..

445
00:13:32,690 --> 00:13:34,690
Maybe so...

446
00:13:35,760 --> 00:13:37,260
What is this...

447
00:13:37,060 --> 00:13:39,060
This is...

448
00:13:37,700 --> 00:13:39,700
Bariaan...

449
00:13:41,970 --> 00:13:44,600
No way it could just be this, surely...

450
00:13:43,500 --> 00:13:46,500
No, I think he is going to break apart and...

451
00:13:44,600 --> 00:13:46,600
Yeah this is where it really starts...

452
00:13:47,610 --> 00:13:50,980
Wow, that's AWESOME!!

453
00:13:51,910 --> 00:13:53,910
Isn't it?!

454
00:13:53,180 --> 00:13:54,980
Hosei-san couldn't hold it back

455
00:13:55,080 --> 00:13:57,950
It just came out!

456
00:13:56,180 --> 00:13:59,020
Is it awesome?

457
00:13:56,810 --> 00:13:58,810
He accidentally blurted 'It's so awesome'...

458
00:13:59,020 --> 00:14:01,020
Is it really?..

459
00:13:59,680 --> 00:14:01,680
Thank you so much

460
00:14:02,390 --> 00:14:04,820
It's just a stalker...

461
00:14:05,220 --> 00:14:07,390
No no, not at all

462
00:14:06,190 --> 00:14:09,220
However you look at it, it's just a normal stalker

463
00:14:07,390 --> 00:14:10,160
No, this is the defence robot, Bariaan.

464
00:14:10,160 --> 00:14:14,270
So you just defend really?

465
00:14:12,860 --> 00:14:16,430
Well I mean I can attack as well obviously

466
00:14:16,430 --> 00:14:20,640
But I focus on the defence more...

467
00:14:19,040 --> 00:14:23,840
Specializes in defence

468
00:14:20,640 --> 00:14:23,880
So really this is all

469
00:14:23,880 --> 00:14:26,340
harder than diamond

470
00:14:26,340 --> 00:14:29,380
so whatever missile comes I can just

471
00:14:29,110 --> 00:14:35,420
The barrier can protect him for any attacks.

472
00:14:29,380 --> 00:14:32,180
The barrier can just do this...

473
00:14:31,180 --> 00:14:33,180
Oh, just defend...

474
00:14:32,920 --> 00:14:35,690
And then I can walk on like this...

475
00:14:33,720 --> 00:14:36,720
And when you think it's okay...

476
00:14:35,690 --> 00:14:37,820
I just pop out

477
00:14:37,820 --> 00:14:40,820
and the attack...

478
00:14:39,820 --> 00:14:41,630
Well obviously you need an attack as well...

479
00:14:41,130 --> 00:14:44,260
Yeah

480
00:14:41,630 --> 00:14:44,630
Man I can totally see inside your barrier

481
00:14:44,960 --> 00:14:47,270
You can totally tell what kind of lifestyle you live...

482
00:14:47,400 --> 00:14:50,230
Like a one room flat...

483
00:14:48,330 --> 00:14:51,330
Your lifestyle is awful

484
00:14:50,230 --> 00:14:53,470
It's literally a one room...

485
00:14:52,370 --> 00:14:56,370
It feels a bit like the entrance to a one-room apartment, but...

486
00:14:54,910 --> 00:14:58,040
What is that, your weapons?

487
00:14:57,040 --> 00:14:58,280
So these are the missiles

488
00:14:58,110 --> 00:15:04,420
Slipper Missiles can be launched

489
00:14:58,280 --> 00:15:01,280
So can I do it once, it's a bit dangerous..

490
00:15:00,580 --> 00:15:02,250
Really?

491
00:15:01,650 --> 00:15:03,150
So when I want to attack

492
00:15:02,250 --> 00:15:03,750
Yeah...

493
00:15:04,250 --> 00:15:06,580
So I am now in defence...

494
00:15:06,580 --> 00:15:08,150
And when I go on offense,

495
00:15:08,150 --> 00:15:09,850
I open up and go BAM!

496
00:15:09,850 --> 00:15:12,890
I open up and go BAM!

497
00:15:11,860 --> 00:15:13,620
Your leg...

498
00:15:12,560 --> 00:15:14,560
Endo-san, your leg...

499
00:15:13,620 --> 00:15:15,620
Your leg...

500
00:15:15,130 --> 00:15:17,130
The protection of your leg came flying out...

501
00:15:16,360 --> 00:15:19,360
The protector...

502
00:15:18,130 --> 00:15:21,230
I guess his leg protection can come off...

503
00:15:20,670 --> 00:15:23,600
Yeah, it's like that

504
00:15:21,730 --> 00:15:24,800
Is it okay for it to come off?

505
00:15:24,040 --> 00:15:27,100
Oh wait, what?

506
00:15:26,370 --> 00:15:28,370
So this can't come off?

507
00:15:27,200 --> 00:15:28,240
No, this shouldn't have come off

508
00:15:28,240 --> 00:15:30,570
No, this shouldn't have come off

509
00:15:29,210 --> 00:15:31,040
The protection

510
00:15:31,040 --> 00:15:34,810
for the weakest part of your body, the shin...

511
00:15:33,440 --> 00:15:36,480
You'll get defeated...

512
00:15:34,810 --> 00:15:37,050
You don't want to lose the shin guards...

513
00:15:37,050 --> 00:15:46,060
Bariaan

514
00:15:37,050 --> 00:15:46,060
Can protect from any attacks

515
00:15:37,050 --> 00:15:46,060
Defence Robot

516
00:15:37,050 --> 00:15:46,060
Emphasis on defence

517
00:15:37,050 --> 00:15:46,060
Has Slipper missiles

518
00:15:37,550 --> 00:15:41,420
The robot that focuses on defence, Bariaan

519
00:15:41,420 --> 00:15:46,060
It's got armour harder than diamond and can protect itself from any attacks

520
00:15:46,420 --> 00:15:52,960
Hamada's robot

521
00:15:46,420 --> 00:15:52,960
Step forward

522
00:15:46,860 --> 00:15:49,960
Hamada, who was struggling to make his robot

523
00:15:49,960 --> 00:15:52,960
How did he do in the end?

524
00:15:53,030 --> 00:15:57,400
Hamada-san's robot, Hamajinga Z, step forward!

525
00:15:57,940 --> 00:16:00,940
Hamajinga Z

526
00:15:59,270 --> 00:16:01,270
You're kidding me...

527
00:16:01,270 --> 00:16:04,270
You got to be kidding me

528
00:16:02,070 --> 00:16:05,570
Just from the name, I have no expectations of it..

529
00:16:06,640 --> 00:16:08,640
Something on his right arm keeps moving

530
00:16:08,110 --> 00:16:10,280
Hang on, he's so small!

531
00:16:08,880 --> 00:16:11,850
That's a drill on his arm...

532
00:16:10,350 --> 00:16:13,380
It's a drill?

533
00:16:12,720 --> 00:16:14,720
I think that's the hand

534
00:16:14,150 --> 00:16:17,350
Wait, it's so small

535
00:16:14,990 --> 00:16:16,490
It's so slow!

536
00:16:16,490 --> 00:16:19,690
Hamajinga Z is so slow!

537
00:16:18,760 --> 00:16:21,060
Damn...

538
00:16:21,230 --> 00:16:24,060
It's disgusting!!

539
00:16:22,690 --> 00:16:25,690
What's with the strange balance?

540
00:16:23,690 --> 00:16:26,690
His legs are so stiff that he's so slow!

541
00:16:26,600 --> 00:16:28,600
It's disgusting!

542
00:16:28,170 --> 00:16:30,170
He can't move at all

543
00:16:28,930 --> 00:16:30,930
And he is so small

544
00:16:32,870 --> 00:16:36,540
It looks like Ohyoi-san (NOTE: Ohyoi-san is a nickname for Shunji Fujimura)

545
00:16:36,540 --> 00:16:38,040
It literally is

546
00:16:38,480 --> 00:16:41,210
I'm a very attack-minded robot

547
00:16:39,740 --> 00:16:42,240
An attacking robot.

548
00:16:41,210 --> 00:16:44,150
Yes, this is my drill

549
00:16:41,610 --> 00:16:46,250
Super Attack-focused Robot

550
00:16:42,910 --> 00:16:46,050
Yeah I got that...

551
00:16:44,280 --> 00:16:46,780
What is that horn thing on your head?

552
00:16:46,350 --> 00:16:48,850
This is a rocket

553
00:16:47,690 --> 00:16:50,690
A rocket?

554
00:16:49,620 --> 00:16:51,620
But it will just shoot upwards...

555
00:16:51,060 --> 00:16:53,060
What kind of rocket?

556
00:16:52,220 --> 00:16:56,190
No so anything that comes right above me, I will just shoot it like this...

557
00:16:56,790 --> 00:17:02,370
Equipped with missiles that will shoot enemies that are right above

558
00:16:59,330 --> 00:17:02,330
So he just guesses...

559
00:17:01,430 --> 00:17:04,530
A rough estimate.

560
00:17:02,630 --> 00:17:05,700
He's going to miss a lot...

561
00:17:07,640 --> 00:17:10,170
What is the left hand?

562
00:17:09,440 --> 00:17:09,810
Oh this, is also attack-minded, so it's like

563
00:17:09,810 --> 00:17:12,640
Oh this, is also attack-minded, so it's like

564
00:17:12,640 --> 00:17:14,580
a sword

565
00:17:13,540 --> 00:17:16,040
A sword?!

566
00:17:15,510 --> 00:17:18,710
Isn't that a trowel?

567
00:17:16,710 --> 00:17:18,380
It's very sharp

568
00:17:18,380 --> 00:17:21,380
It can cut anything

569
00:17:19,450 --> 00:17:22,720
Isn't it a cinnamon cookie?

570
00:17:22,720 --> 00:17:24,720
And my legs are

571
00:17:24,720 --> 00:17:27,220
hammers...

572
00:17:25,890 --> 00:17:32,030
He can attack with his legs which are hammers

573
00:17:26,990 --> 00:17:28,830
Oh I see

574
00:17:27,730 --> 00:17:30,760
Oh it's a hammer

575
00:17:28,360 --> 00:17:31,030
Yeah

576
00:17:28,830 --> 00:17:31,960
And that's why he's so slow

577
00:17:31,030 --> 00:17:33,030
And drop kick...

578
00:17:32,160 --> 00:17:33,560
Please do it then, so an enemy has come

579
00:17:33,560 --> 00:17:34,560
Please do it then, so an enemy has come

580
00:17:37,130 --> 00:17:38,600
Damn, it must be a small enemy

581
00:17:38,600 --> 00:17:41,600
I'm guessing your opponent was someone you could beat up from the start...

582
00:17:42,310 --> 00:17:44,610
And we also have his illustration...

583
00:17:44,610 --> 00:17:47,580
right here and this is how he actually wanted to design it...

584
00:17:47,910 --> 00:17:50,910
Well the illustration itself is awful...

585
00:17:50,250 --> 00:17:53,250
His illustration is worse than the real thing...

586
00:17:53,520 --> 00:17:56,520
What the hell is this, the colours he's chosen really piss me off...

587
00:17:57,620 --> 00:18:00,620
Why does he have white trousers?..

588
00:18:00,560 --> 00:18:02,560
You're right

589
00:18:01,630 --> 00:18:04,630
It shouldn't be white...

590
00:18:04,230 --> 00:18:06,230
I see

591
00:18:04,860 --> 00:18:06,360
It's off balance

592
00:18:06,760 --> 00:18:08,170
The precious missile

593
00:18:08,470 --> 00:18:09,170
If this happens, I can take any enemy diagonally upwards out

594
00:18:09,170 --> 00:18:10,000
If this happens, I can take any enemy diagonally upwards out

595
00:18:10,000 --> 00:18:12,870
If this happens, I can take any enemy diagonally upwards out

596
00:18:11,640 --> 00:18:14,700
You'd adjust the timing

597
00:18:13,070 --> 00:18:15,210
Yeah yeah

598
00:18:15,210 --> 00:18:18,170
It depends on the situation...

599
00:18:18,440 --> 00:18:21,950
But you know, I can't see like any joints...

600
00:18:21,480 --> 00:18:26,720
No joints so hard to move

601
00:18:22,810 --> 00:18:24,980
Yeah, that's true, his arms and everything...

602
00:18:24,980 --> 00:18:26,980
Oh dear...

603
00:18:28,390 --> 00:18:31,450
I may have got it a bit wrong...

604
00:18:30,650 --> 00:18:32,790
This robot is SO weak!

605
00:18:31,860 --> 00:18:32,790
Definitely

606
00:18:32,790 --> 00:18:41,770
Can shoot missiles at enemies directly above it

607
00:18:32,790 --> 00:18:41,770
Hamajinga Z

608
00:18:32,790 --> 00:18:41,770
Has no joints so can't move very well

609
00:18:32,790 --> 00:18:41,770
Legs can be used as hammers

610
00:18:32,790 --> 00:18:41,770
Super Attack-focused Robot

611
00:18:33,420 --> 00:18:35,290
Hamajinga Z!

612
00:18:35,290 --> 00:18:37,230
It's a Super Attack-focused Robot

613
00:18:37,230 --> 00:18:41,770
It has no joints though, so it can't move very well which is its weakness.

614
00:18:42,270 --> 00:18:46,800
After this

615
00:18:42,270 --> 00:18:46,800
Matsumoto's robot steps forward!

616
00:18:42,470 --> 00:18:43,300
After this

617
00:18:43,300 --> 00:18:46,800
Matsumoto's robot is shown!

618
00:18:47,370 --> 00:18:53,640
Matsumoto's robot

619
00:18:47,370 --> 00:18:53,640
step forward

620
00:18:48,070 --> 00:18:50,140
Who's robot is the ultimate robot?

621
00:18:50,140 --> 00:18:53,640
Last up is Matsumoto's cardboard robot

622
00:18:53,910 --> 00:18:58,620
Matsumoto-san's robot, NTV Robot, Holdings... Step forward

623
00:18:59,980 --> 00:19:08,090
NTV Robot: Holdings

624
00:19:02,990 --> 00:19:05,990
If it's a NTV robot, maybe it's huge in size.

625
00:19:07,960 --> 00:19:09,990
Holy crap!

626
00:19:09,990 --> 00:19:13,190
It's huge!

627
00:19:12,530 --> 00:19:15,800
It's huge!

628
00:19:14,700 --> 00:19:17,730
How is it moving?

629
00:19:18,100 --> 00:19:19,600
What is this?!

630
00:19:18,800 --> 00:19:21,800
The movement is so smooth!

631
00:19:20,270 --> 00:19:23,340
Those things aren't straight

632
00:19:22,140 --> 00:19:24,140
The arms...

633
00:19:23,340 --> 00:19:25,340
Oh, those are the arms?

634
00:19:24,710 --> 00:19:27,880
It's amazing right?

635
00:19:25,580 --> 00:19:28,810
Wait, we're not eating cold noodles from that?

636
00:19:27,880 --> 00:19:29,550
The ones that come flowing out?..

637
00:19:29,550 --> 00:19:30,750
Hang on a minute...

638
00:19:29,950 --> 00:19:31,950
Can you tell us a bit about it...

639
00:19:30,750 --> 00:19:33,750
This is absolutely huge, Matsumoto-san

640
00:19:32,680 --> 00:19:37,990
2.5 metres tall

641
00:19:33,020 --> 00:19:36,490
In terms of its size, it's a lot more impressive than the other robots.

642
00:19:36,450 --> 00:19:38,450
It's huge

643
00:19:38,560 --> 00:19:39,760
It has loads of weapons too

644
00:19:39,760 --> 00:19:41,230
It has loads of weapons too

645
00:19:40,620 --> 00:19:41,620
I see

646
00:19:41,460 --> 00:19:43,460
For example...

647
00:19:48,030 --> 00:19:50,030
Bowling balls?..

648
00:19:48,430 --> 00:19:50,430
Wow wow wow, that's dangerous

649
00:19:51,970 --> 00:19:52,970
It's so dangerous

650
00:19:52,470 --> 00:19:54,470
So many come out...

651
00:19:53,170 --> 00:19:59,910
Bowling ball bombs as a weapon

652
00:19:53,300 --> 00:19:54,610
It can

653
00:19:54,610 --> 00:19:57,610
really make people feel like they're in danger

654
00:19:57,780 --> 00:19:59,910
It is really dangerous

655
00:19:58,310 --> 00:19:59,910
It's so dangerous...

656
00:19:59,910 --> 00:20:01,880
It will really annoy you too

657
00:20:01,880 --> 00:20:03,450
And also...

658
00:20:03,450 --> 00:20:05,450
I can do this...

659
00:20:06,680 --> 00:20:08,350
What's this

660
00:20:07,180 --> 00:20:10,180
What's that

661
00:20:07,620 --> 00:20:09,620
Something has come out

662
00:20:08,350 --> 00:20:10,420
Some weird thing has come out

663
00:20:10,420 --> 00:20:11,460
These are my kids

664
00:20:11,460 --> 00:20:13,390
They're still infants...

665
00:20:13,560 --> 00:20:15,690
Infants?

666
00:20:14,190 --> 00:20:16,190
They're infants?

667
00:20:15,690 --> 00:20:18,730
He just kicked your infant

668
00:20:15,930 --> 00:20:17,330
So lots

669
00:20:17,330 --> 00:20:19,260
of infants come out

670
00:20:19,260 --> 00:20:20,330
and

671
00:20:20,330 --> 00:20:23,330
and eat into you

672
00:20:21,770 --> 00:20:28,910
The small robots eat into the enemy

673
00:20:22,970 --> 00:20:26,070
So these things are the main robot's kids?

674
00:20:24,440 --> 00:20:27,910
Yes, so even whilst this is all happening

675
00:20:27,910 --> 00:20:29,040
inside...

676
00:20:29,040 --> 00:20:32,040
they're copulating...

677
00:20:30,470 --> 00:20:32,510
Inside?..

678
00:20:31,180 --> 00:20:34,310
They're copulating right now, inside?

679
00:20:32,510 --> 00:20:34,310
Is there a female in there?

680
00:20:34,310 --> 00:20:35,810
Damn, so many are coming out

681
00:20:36,450 --> 00:20:38,450
How many?

682
00:20:37,510 --> 00:20:39,510
How many are there?

683
00:20:38,850 --> 00:20:42,050
And seriously...

684
00:20:40,650 --> 00:20:43,620
So many of its kids coming out...

685
00:20:42,690 --> 00:20:45,790
They'll come out at random times.

686
00:20:44,460 --> 00:20:46,460
They're so many of them

687
00:20:44,890 --> 00:20:46,890
It's amazing

688
00:20:46,090 --> 00:20:47,990
So they're going to eat away at the enemy.

689
00:20:47,990 --> 00:20:51,030
So there's loads of things like that...

690
00:20:51,260 --> 00:20:53,560
Wow wow!

691
00:20:52,860 --> 00:20:54,530
Damn, that was dangerous!

692
00:20:53,560 --> 00:20:55,900
That was so dangerous!

693
00:20:54,530 --> 00:20:57,400
Damn, so fast as well

694
00:20:59,240 --> 00:21:03,040
I also have a lethal weapon...

695
00:21:01,110 --> 00:21:03,040
Oh, this isn't all?

696
00:21:07,510 --> 00:21:10,510
Oh shit, I twisted my ankle...

697
00:21:08,410 --> 00:21:10,510
You twisted your ankle?

698
00:21:10,550 --> 00:21:16,850
His final attack is eyeball bombs

699
00:21:11,650 --> 00:21:14,080
You twisted your ankle?

700
00:21:13,080 --> 00:21:15,080
You twisted your ankle?

701
00:21:14,080 --> 00:21:16,850
So, does he lose his eyes then?

702
00:21:16,150 --> 00:21:16,850
His eyes...

703
00:21:16,850 --> 00:21:19,860
He had eye balls inside too...

704
00:21:19,860 --> 00:21:21,330
But I can't reach the eye sockets to put them back in...

705
00:21:21,330 --> 00:21:23,990
But I can't reach the eye sockets to put them back in...

706
00:21:24,530 --> 00:21:27,360
Oh, that's why you twisted your ankle before...

707
00:21:27,130 --> 00:21:29,500
Because of that...

708
00:21:29,500 --> 00:21:31,100
He jumped...

709
00:21:31,100 --> 00:21:34,710
So you're looking through the hands part?

710
00:21:34,100 --> 00:21:34,710
Yeah...

711
00:21:34,710 --> 00:21:35,840
I can't really see through this V part...

712
00:21:35,840 --> 00:21:38,510
I can't really see through this V part...

713
00:21:40,810 --> 00:21:43,710
This is meant to be a robot, right?

714
00:21:42,650 --> 00:21:44,580
But you know, it's fine.

715
00:21:44,580 --> 00:21:55,730
2.5 metres tall

716
00:21:44,580 --> 00:21:55,730
Has bowling bombs

717
00:21:44,580 --> 00:21:55,730
Has mini robots who eat into the enemy

718
00:21:44,580 --> 00:21:55,730
His final attack is the eye ball bomb

719
00:21:44,580 --> 00:21:55,730
Holdings

720
00:21:44,580 --> 00:21:55,730
NTV Robot

721
00:21:45,580 --> 00:21:48,320
NTV Robot Holdings.

722
00:21:48,320 --> 00:21:51,460
A giant robot 2.5 meters tall.

723
00:21:51,460 --> 00:21:55,730
He will defeat his enemies with a variety of attacks.

724
00:21:56,360 --> 00:21:57,560
Finally, the time for the battle

725
00:21:56,890 --> 00:22:00,730
Now the time for the battle - Who's robot is the ultimate robot?!

726
00:21:57,560 --> 00:22:00,730
Who's robot is the ultimate robot?

727
00:22:01,670 --> 00:22:03,400
Who's robot is the ultimate robot?

728
00:22:02,200 --> 00:22:06,670
Finally, the time for battle - Who's robot is the ultimate robot?!

729
00:22:03,400 --> 00:22:06,670
And that person will sing the theme song to the fight...

730
00:22:07,200 --> 00:22:10,200
Right then, the robot war, START!

731
00:22:19,950 --> 00:22:23,420
Mizuki Ichiro

732
00:22:19,950 --> 00:22:23,420
Special Guest

733
00:22:19,950 --> 00:22:26,460
We are robots, the ultimate robot

734
00:22:26,460 --> 00:22:33,630
To protect peace, stand up now!

735
00:22:33,630 --> 00:22:39,640
Steering wheel rotating ultra sonic sound - Sonic Crush!

736
00:22:39,640 --> 00:22:46,440
The sad fate of the defence robot... BARIAAN!

737
00:22:46,440 --> 00:22:48,050
The sad fate of the defence robot... BARIAAN!

738
00:22:48,050 --> 00:22:54,590
