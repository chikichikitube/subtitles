00:00:14,000 --> 00:00:20,000
Subbed by Thanos-no-Tsukai
Thanks For Watching!

2
00:00:22,850 --> 00:00:23,990
Look at his mouth.

3
00:00:25,320 --> 00:00:26,320
What?

4
00:00:26,390 --> 00:00:27,390
What's wrong, Jimmy-san?

5
00:00:27,460 --> 00:00:28,830
Look at his teeth.

6
00:00:33,160 --> 00:00:34,130
He laughed.

7
00:00:34,400 --> 00:00:35,930
What's this?
Balls.

8
00:00:36,000 --> 00:00:37,000
Can I touch them?

9
00:00:37,300 --> 00:00:40,070
I wouldn't recommend it
but if you wanna.

10
00:00:40,440 --> 00:00:41,910
I want to touch,
just a little.

11
00:00:44,770 --> 00:00:45,780
There we go.

12
00:00:46,310 --> 00:00:47,980
So fluffy!

13
00:00:55,290 --> 00:00:57,550
It was pretty decent.

14
00:00:57,950 --> 00:00:59,860
Compared to past versions.

15
00:01:00,120 --> 00:01:02,330
It was
incredibly good.

16
00:01:02,390 --> 00:01:03,560
It was a good Documental.

17
00:01:03,630 --> 00:01:05,630
For real, yeah.

18
00:01:10,630 --> 00:01:12,640
Okay,
so maybe what comes next.

19
00:01:12,700 --> 00:01:14,070
I wonder...

20
00:01:14,600 --> 00:01:16,010
Let's continue.

21
00:01:23,310 --> 00:01:25,150
Alright, here we go!

22
00:01:25,350 --> 00:01:26,980
Can I use this?

23
00:01:27,150 --> 00:01:28,290
He can?

24
00:01:29,250 --> 00:01:32,720
Can we use the tofu like that?

25
00:01:33,020 --> 00:01:34,620
Yeah, for sure.

26
00:01:37,360 --> 00:01:38,400
What's that?

27
00:01:39,500 --> 00:01:43,230
It's a brush... a brush.

28
00:01:43,300 --> 00:01:45,870
That's pretty overkill.
Is it for dogs?

29
00:01:46,370 --> 00:01:51,370
No, no. It's a woman's
brush, I think.

30
00:01:51,640 --> 00:01:52,880
About 2000 yen.

31
00:01:55,780 --> 00:01:57,380
Okay, wanna play Karuta? (Editor's Note: 1)

32
00:01:58,050 --> 00:01:59,580
I made an original Karuta.

33
00:01:59,650 --> 00:02:00,750
Let's do that!

34
00:02:01,380 --> 00:02:02,490
Me too!

35
00:02:03,650 --> 00:02:05,590
Okay, we have to look first.

36
00:02:06,190 --> 00:02:07,360
This is "A".

37
00:02:07,360 --> 00:02:11,640
"Anal and shrimp?
Raw or cold?"

38
00:02:13,530 --> 00:02:14,660
This is "I"

39
00:02:14,660 --> 00:02:15,830
"I came, so I opened my eyes."

40
00:02:15,830 --> 00:02:16,870
That's crazy.
"I came, so I opened my eyes."

41
00:02:16,870 --> 00:02:16,930
"I came,
so I opened my eyes."

42
00:02:16,930 --> 00:02:18,030
It's too much.
"I came, so I opened my eyes."

43
00:02:18,030 --> 00:02:18,100
"I came,
so I opened my eyes."

44
00:02:18,100 --> 00:02:19,700
Wouldn't you normally close them?
"I came, so I opened my eyes."

45
00:02:22,170 --> 00:02:23,170
Just a face.

46
00:02:23,240 --> 00:02:28,610
"If you squint a little,
the mosaic disappears."

47
00:02:28,680 --> 00:02:30,050
Right, right.

48
00:02:31,780 --> 00:02:32,880
"E"

49
00:02:33,120 --> 00:02:36,920
"Eguchi Yosuke?
He'd look good with some lipstick on."

50
00:02:37,320 --> 00:02:38,590
Next. "O"

51
00:02:39,220 --> 00:02:40,190
"Oh, pussy."

52
00:02:44,760 --> 00:02:45,860
"Ca" ("Ka")

53
00:02:47,100 --> 00:02:50,400
"Can you get me some of that
sweet shit?"

54
00:02:58,110 --> 00:02:59,410
Damn, who was it?

55
00:03:00,640 --> 00:03:01,850
Wasn't it you?

56
00:03:01,910 --> 00:03:03,450
Weren't you talking
while smiling?

57
00:03:03,650 --> 00:03:04,850
This is pretty serious.

58
00:03:05,820 --> 00:03:10,220
No, but I was just smiling
to make others smile.

59
00:03:10,290 --> 00:03:11,290
Like inviting us?

60
00:03:11,350 --> 00:03:13,120
Exactly, I'd say
that I'm in the clean— clear.

61
00:03:13,260 --> 00:03:14,760
Clean?

62
00:03:14,860 --> 00:03:16,190
Clean clear?

63
00:03:17,530 --> 00:03:18,730
Okay, so!

64
00:03:18,800 --> 00:03:19,800
Who was it?

65
00:03:20,060 --> 00:03:22,930
Uh... Koba!

66
00:03:23,000 --> 00:03:25,700
Huh?!
I wasn't smiling!

67
00:03:25,800 --> 00:03:27,240
—For real?
—Yeah!

68
00:03:27,300 --> 00:03:28,740
—You sure?
—Take a look!

69
00:03:28,810 --> 00:03:29,840
—Totally sure?
—Yes.

70
00:03:30,410 --> 00:03:34,540
You were already on a tight rope
with Cookie's Karuta game.

71
00:03:35,010 --> 00:03:36,810
It was pretty serious.

72
00:03:36,910 --> 00:03:38,820
I think I was holding it.

73
00:03:38,880 --> 00:03:40,020
Really?

74
00:03:40,820 --> 00:03:42,290
"Ka"

75
00:03:43,150 --> 00:03:46,420
Can you get me some of that
sweet shit?

76
00:03:50,330 --> 00:03:51,330
You were smiling!

77
00:03:51,390 --> 00:03:53,030
He was smiling!

78
00:03:53,500 --> 00:03:54,500
That counts as smiling?!

79
00:03:54,560 --> 00:03:56,230
You were smiling!

80
00:03:57,270 --> 00:03:59,100
—No way!
—Yeah, yeah, yeah.

81
00:03:59,440 --> 00:04:00,440
Have mercy.

82
00:04:00,500 --> 00:04:03,110
You should be out for lying.

83
00:04:03,170 --> 00:04:04,410
He was totally smiling.

84
00:04:05,980 --> 00:04:08,680
Jimmy was smiling as well
at a weird time.

85
00:04:09,580 --> 00:04:10,750
All along, yeah.

86
00:04:13,120 --> 00:04:15,220
I can't even count anymore.

87
00:04:16,190 --> 00:04:17,550
That's just my face.

88
00:04:17,620 --> 00:04:19,890
No, no, not at all.

89
00:04:20,060 --> 00:04:21,660
Right, we're following the rules.

90
00:04:33,000 --> 00:04:34,100
Okay, here we go.

91
00:04:36,570 --> 00:04:38,040
Everyone left.

92
00:04:38,610 --> 00:04:39,780
Feels lonely in here.

93
00:04:39,840 --> 00:04:41,310
I want to look at this.

94
00:04:41,380 --> 00:04:43,480
Let's wait until
everyone's back.

95
00:04:43,610 --> 00:04:45,120
Let's just do it a little

96
00:04:45,450 --> 00:04:49,150
"Anal and shrimp?
Raw or cold?"

97
00:04:49,720 --> 00:04:50,850
That's good.

98
00:04:52,620 --> 00:04:55,760
"I came, so I opened my eyes."

99
00:04:56,090 --> 00:04:57,630
That's pretty good.

100
00:04:57,690 --> 00:04:59,000
This is great.

101
00:04:59,060 --> 00:05:02,930
"If you squint a little,
the mosaic disappears."

102
00:05:03,070 --> 00:05:04,230
Great, great.

103
00:05:04,300 --> 00:05:05,900
Are you imitating
Master Daisuke?

104
00:05:05,970 --> 00:05:07,740
I am, Kansai style.

105
00:05:07,900 --> 00:05:11,940
"Eguchi Yosuke?
He'd look good with some lipstick on."

106
00:05:13,580 --> 00:05:14,610
"Oh, pussy."

107
00:05:17,610 --> 00:05:20,850
Can you get me some of that
sweet shit?

108
00:05:21,250 --> 00:05:22,520
Amazing.

109
00:05:24,590 --> 00:05:27,560
"My balls are hot.
My balls are hot!"

110
00:05:29,060 --> 00:05:31,360
Wa-wa-wait.
Just once.

111
00:05:32,260 --> 00:05:34,730
Don't waste it now.

112
00:05:34,960 --> 00:05:36,170
We should wait.

113
00:05:37,130 --> 00:05:38,200
Let's look at them together.

114
00:05:38,270 --> 00:05:39,370
Together, yeah.

115
00:05:39,440 --> 00:05:40,740
Call them over.

116
00:05:41,840 --> 00:05:43,740
Let's look at them together.

117
00:05:43,810 --> 00:05:44,810
What?

118
00:05:44,870 --> 00:05:46,040
Cookie's Karuta.

119
00:05:46,180 --> 00:05:49,480
Can I show you
something in the meantime?

120
00:05:49,880 --> 00:05:53,720
It's a prejudice book I made (Prejudice/Stereotype/Bias)

121
00:05:53,880 --> 00:05:54,920
Prejudice?

122
00:05:55,420 --> 00:05:57,120
What should we do?

123
00:05:57,190 --> 00:06:00,260
Just ask for one
and I'll say it.

124
00:06:00,320 --> 00:06:04,060
All my prejudices
are right here.

125
00:06:04,860 --> 00:06:06,000
Give me a prejudice!

126
00:06:06,260 --> 00:06:08,670
Alright, what number from the top?

127
00:06:08,800 --> 00:06:10,370
The first one!

128
00:06:11,270 --> 00:06:16,340
Alright...
People who look like Inagawa Junji

129
00:06:18,070 --> 00:06:19,240
hit women.

130
00:06:19,580 --> 00:06:20,880
"Cha!" (Kenji Tamura (Tamuken) - "Ciao")

131
00:06:21,640 --> 00:06:24,050
The "cha" isn't necessary.
I was close.

132
00:06:24,110 --> 00:06:26,320
I was about to laugh
but it brought me back.

133
00:06:26,380 --> 00:06:28,220
I pressed the wrong button.

134
00:06:29,090 --> 00:06:30,090
Give me another one.

135
00:06:30,150 --> 00:06:31,450
What number from the top?

136
00:06:31,520 --> 00:06:33,360
Number six, let's do that.

137
00:06:34,660 --> 00:06:37,130
Grannies

138
00:06:37,790 --> 00:06:41,100
Grannies that gossip
in spring

139
00:06:42,000 --> 00:06:43,030
get cancer.

140
00:06:44,930 --> 00:06:46,900
Don't joke about that, man.

141
00:06:47,640 --> 00:06:49,470
It's a prejudice...

142
00:06:49,540 --> 00:06:50,870
Prejudice?

143
00:06:51,310 --> 00:06:52,710
It won't open!

144
00:06:54,010 --> 00:06:57,010
It's already dented
just open a hole.

145
00:06:58,150 --> 00:06:59,980
Koumoto-san look at this.

146
00:07:00,780 --> 00:07:02,050
Damn it

147
00:07:02,750 --> 00:07:04,590
Whoa, your back...

148
00:07:05,360 --> 00:07:07,120
What happened to your back?

149
00:07:07,620 --> 00:07:09,630
What's that, man?

150
00:07:09,890 --> 00:07:11,460
I was playing with my hamster.

151
00:07:14,500 --> 00:07:16,430
Those bangs are too short.

152
00:07:16,570 --> 00:07:17,800
Who are you?

153
00:07:17,870 --> 00:07:19,270
I'm Mito Natsume. (EN: 2)

154
00:07:21,300 --> 00:07:22,970
Ah, Mito Natsume.

155
00:07:23,710 --> 00:07:25,640
-Ouch!
Not Masami Hisamoto's sister?

156
00:07:25,840 --> 00:07:27,880
-What was that?
There we go.

157
00:07:29,950 --> 00:07:31,780
Mito Natsume-san?

158
00:07:34,180 --> 00:07:37,520
Wait,
I'm a little thirsty.

159
00:07:38,820 --> 00:07:40,520
No, no, no!

160
00:07:41,260 --> 00:07:42,590
Watch out, watch out!

161
00:07:42,760 --> 00:07:44,630
That's not for your eyes!

162
00:07:46,860 --> 00:07:47,960
My eyes hurt.

163
00:07:48,030 --> 00:07:49,070
Remember these.

164
00:07:49,270 --> 00:07:50,500
Remember the Karuta.

165
00:07:58,540 --> 00:07:59,780
What's this Karuta?

166
00:08:18,030 --> 00:08:20,860
Master Daisuke sure has
a foul mouth, huh?

167
00:08:22,030 --> 00:08:24,430
He doesn't say much, though.

168
00:08:24,530 --> 00:08:25,500
Read them.

169
00:08:25,740 --> 00:08:26,740
What?

170
00:08:27,270 --> 00:08:28,370
Read.

171
00:08:28,840 --> 00:08:34,410
I slipped up and told the story of how
I got beat up by Nakabo at a festival.

172
00:08:35,950 --> 00:08:39,250
The manager... couldn't come out...?

173
00:08:40,220 --> 00:08:41,990
You shouldn't be reading this!

174
00:08:46,690 --> 00:08:47,890
Too fast!

175
00:08:49,630 --> 00:08:51,730
-It was Koumoto!
-Definitely Koumoto!

176
00:08:51,830 --> 00:08:53,400
-No way!
-This is serious.

177
00:08:53,460 --> 00:08:54,360
Koumoto!

178
00:08:54,500 --> 00:08:58,670
That was just hilarious
come on...!

179
00:08:59,200 --> 00:09:01,170
This is how I managed to hold on.

180
00:09:02,910 --> 00:09:04,570
With this.

181
00:09:05,540 --> 00:09:07,440
That's how you do it?!

182
00:09:08,040 --> 00:09:09,850
You can't be doing this!

183
00:09:10,050 --> 00:09:11,980
It definitely wasn't me!

184
00:09:12,050 --> 00:09:13,750
Is it so wrong
to use this?

185
00:09:14,020 --> 00:09:17,220
Well, yeah,
this time it wasn't Koba.

186
00:09:17,490 --> 00:09:20,460
I think he knows,
but it was Koumoto.

187
00:09:20,560 --> 00:09:22,760
For real...?!

188
00:09:23,660 --> 00:09:24,760
Read.

189
00:09:25,190 --> 00:09:30,700
I slipped up and told the story of how
I got beat up by Nakabo at a festival.

190
00:09:32,200 --> 00:09:35,570
The manager... couldn't come out...?

191
00:09:36,570 --> 00:09:38,270
You shouldn't be reading this!

192
00:09:44,950 --> 00:09:46,380
Here you go, Koumoto.

193
00:09:46,480 --> 00:09:48,550
That's rough!

194
00:09:48,820 --> 00:09:50,290
-Second one!
-Ah, right!

195
00:09:51,450 --> 00:09:53,120
Was it this?

196
00:09:53,190 --> 00:09:54,920
That was dirty, really.

197
00:09:54,990 --> 00:09:56,760
You took that picture?!

198
00:10:03,070 --> 00:10:04,300
Here we go!

199
00:10:06,740 --> 00:10:07,800
Whoa!

200
00:10:10,570 --> 00:10:11,570
What's wrong?

201
00:10:13,140 --> 00:10:14,410
You're Mito Natsume, right?

202
00:10:15,340 --> 00:10:16,510
What's going on?

203
00:10:17,050 --> 00:10:18,650
What's that sticking out?

204
00:10:18,710 --> 00:10:19,850
It's just in there, chill.

205
00:10:19,920 --> 00:10:20,920
Is that the head?

206
00:10:20,980 --> 00:10:22,620
Not the head. Just how it looks.

207
00:10:22,690 --> 00:10:23,720
That's embarrassing.

208
00:10:23,790 --> 00:10:24,990
That's Mito-chan's?

209
00:10:25,050 --> 00:10:26,560
Definitely Mito-chan's.

210
00:10:27,220 --> 00:10:28,720
You're too hard!

211
00:10:28,790 --> 00:10:30,260
Mito-chan's is that big?

212
00:10:30,330 --> 00:10:31,490
The head?

213
00:10:33,330 --> 00:10:34,530
The head, yeah.

214
00:10:34,600 --> 00:10:37,870
That's how it looks.
It's not even that hard.

215
00:10:39,170 --> 00:10:40,170
It's hard.

216
00:10:40,700 --> 00:10:42,470
Take it out, man.

217
00:10:43,370 --> 00:10:44,510
There's something there.

218
00:10:46,340 --> 00:10:48,440
What did you do to your dick?

219
00:10:48,880 --> 00:10:50,380
His balls are red.

220
00:10:50,450 --> 00:10:52,080
You pulled on your balls?

221
00:10:54,380 --> 00:10:55,380
What's that?

222
00:10:59,790 --> 00:11:01,720
Wa-wa-wait!

223
00:11:03,590 --> 00:11:04,990
Kubota too!

224
00:11:05,630 --> 00:11:07,160
I'm fine, I'm fine.

225
00:11:08,030 --> 00:11:09,100
This is just-

226
00:11:09,870 --> 00:11:11,130
That's not normal!

227
00:11:12,500 --> 00:11:13,600
That's an STD!

228
00:11:13,970 --> 00:11:15,440
It's far too red!

229
00:11:16,140 --> 00:11:17,640
He has red-ball disease.

230
00:11:18,710 --> 00:11:21,540
No, this is just tight
and kinda hot.

231
00:11:22,250 --> 00:11:23,810
He laughed out loud, right?

232
00:11:24,050 --> 00:11:26,280
This was pretty bad, yeah.

233
00:11:26,350 --> 00:11:28,950
We didn't get that much
on camera, don't worry.

234
00:11:30,090 --> 00:11:31,090
An STD?

235
00:11:31,920 --> 00:11:33,420
Kinda

236
00:11:37,230 --> 00:11:39,860
Not really, but it just
looks a bit like it.

237
00:11:39,930 --> 00:11:41,500
This is pretty normal.

238
00:11:41,630 --> 00:11:42,630
That's red!

239
00:11:42,800 --> 00:11:43,870
No, no, no!

240
00:11:43,930 --> 00:11:45,400
He has red-balls disease, ,man!

241
00:11:46,970 --> 00:11:51,270
That's just what happens when it gets hot
so I use a towel and-

242
00:11:52,110 --> 00:11:54,340
I pack one of these.

243
00:11:55,010 --> 00:11:56,610
You were gonna use that later?

244
00:11:57,650 --> 00:11:58,750
What's that?

245
00:11:58,920 --> 00:12:00,550
It gives it shape.

246
00:12:04,550 --> 00:12:05,720
What's going on?

247
00:12:09,730 --> 00:12:11,630
Wa-wa-wait!

248
00:12:14,060 --> 00:12:17,070
Yeah, right.
I couldn't hold it at all!

249
00:12:17,400 --> 00:12:19,270
Well, this is a point for Nadal.

250
00:12:19,340 --> 00:12:20,400
Yeah!

251
00:12:20,470 --> 00:12:21,600
A point for his balls.

252
00:12:23,070 --> 00:12:24,040
A ball point.

253
00:12:24,110 --> 00:12:25,170
Ah damn!

254
00:12:25,780 --> 00:12:30,780
We're in a rough spot.
And it's all at a bad time.

255
00:12:30,880 --> 00:12:32,110
Alright!

256
00:12:36,090 --> 00:12:37,190
Only two hours.

257
00:12:37,250 --> 00:12:38,490
Still four left.

258
00:12:38,990 --> 00:12:40,720
I thought it had been more time.

259
00:12:42,730 --> 00:12:46,160
There you go again, man!

260
00:12:46,800 --> 00:12:48,160
What?

261
00:12:48,330 --> 00:12:49,470
What's wrong?

262
00:12:49,970 --> 00:12:51,570
No, come on!

263
00:12:52,770 --> 00:12:53,970
We can do this.

264
00:12:54,040 --> 00:12:55,710
We can laugh right now.

265
00:12:56,910 --> 00:12:58,270
No, man...

266
00:12:58,340 --> 00:13:00,910
I have to do it again...
Can't be helped!

267
00:13:00,980 --> 00:13:03,310
I haven't done anything!
Huh? What?

268
00:13:05,720 --> 00:13:06,780
Don't know?

269
00:13:06,850 --> 00:13:07,850
Show us.

270
00:13:07,920 --> 00:13:09,590
What's wrong, senpai?

271
00:13:10,450 --> 00:13:11,450
Is this it?

272
00:13:11,520 --> 00:13:12,990
Why d'you take the matches?

273
00:13:13,720 --> 00:13:15,260
-Those are matches!
-What's with you?

274
00:13:15,320 --> 00:13:16,330
Are you mad?

275
00:13:16,390 --> 00:13:21,060
No man! It's in my phone!
You guys are so unfair!

276
00:13:21,130 --> 00:13:22,300
What? Huh?

277
00:13:22,700 --> 00:13:23,770
Wanna look?

278
00:13:24,000 --> 00:13:25,270
No, I won't loog.

279
00:13:25,330 --> 00:13:28,170
"Loog"?

280
00:13:28,270 --> 00:13:30,570
Wanna watch it all together?

281
00:13:30,740 --> 00:13:32,340
Look at this.

282
00:13:32,410 --> 00:13:33,710
Like this?

283
00:13:38,360 --> 00:13:39,920
"My cock?
It has high level phimosis!" (EN: 3)

284
00:13:39,920 --> 00:13:41,160
There's the "wa" karuta.
"My cock?
It has high level phimosis!"

285
00:13:41,160 --> 00:13:41,780
There's the "wa" karuta.

286
00:13:43,120 --> 00:13:44,490
Who put it there?

287
00:13:44,550 --> 00:13:45,690
That's not good.

288
00:13:45,760 --> 00:13:46,820
Jimmy-san?

289
00:13:46,890 --> 00:13:48,090
No, not me.

290
00:13:48,160 --> 00:13:49,660
-He really said that?
-He did.

291
00:13:49,730 --> 00:13:50,830
What is it?

292
00:13:51,660 --> 00:13:54,660
"Maybe I can chew the juice
out of a turd!"

293
00:13:54,960 --> 00:13:55,970
Maybe? What?

294
00:13:56,030 --> 00:13:56,970
He says this?

295
00:13:57,100 --> 00:13:58,730
-What?
-Who says that?

296
00:13:59,140 --> 00:14:00,470
He really said this.

297
00:14:00,570 --> 00:14:02,770
"Wash me from top to bottom!"

298
00:14:04,040 --> 00:14:06,180
"I haven't used soap
in about eight years!"

299
00:14:09,050 --> 00:14:10,510
He said that too

300
00:14:10,580 --> 00:14:11,650
"Sypu!"

301
00:14:11,710 --> 00:14:12,720
Huh?

302
00:14:12,780 --> 00:14:16,350
"Pussy sypu!
Pussy sypu!"

303
00:14:16,950 --> 00:14:19,560
"Maybe I can chew the juice
out of a turd!"

304
00:14:20,120 --> 00:14:23,790
"Wash me from top to bottom!
I haven't used soap in eight years!"

305
00:14:24,090 --> 00:14:25,630
"Nishioka Sumiko?
Don't know her!"

306
00:14:25,930 --> 00:14:28,500
"Can you give me that
sweet piece of shit?"

307
00:14:28,630 --> 00:14:29,970
"First year of Reiwa!"

308
00:14:30,630 --> 00:14:33,040
"A girl I want to fuck?
Zawachin!"

309
00:14:36,840 --> 00:14:38,440
"Detective Night Scoop."

310
00:14:41,210 --> 00:14:43,750
"I don't watch it since
Nagahara Seiki isn't around."

311
00:14:45,720 --> 00:14:47,150
I like it.

312
00:14:49,820 --> 00:14:52,760
Did he say this "ne" one
to Master Hanako?

313
00:14:52,820 --> 00:14:54,120
-What?
-Ne.

314
00:14:54,460 --> 00:14:56,560
"Never look at that hag while she sleeps!"

315
00:14:56,990 --> 00:14:59,560
I'm sure that made
Master Hanako angry!

316
00:14:59,630 --> 00:15:02,530
He didn't say that to Master Hanako
so it's fine. It was Miyako Chocho

317
00:15:07,340 --> 00:15:09,510
This is pretty fun!

318
00:15:09,610 --> 00:15:10,810
More than metal, huh?

319
00:15:12,810 --> 00:15:14,410
You tryin' to pull out your head?

320
00:15:14,980 --> 00:15:20,020
So I've been doing reporting
on adult toys for a while, right?

321
00:15:20,820 --> 00:15:23,950
And lately there are many
with like a good rhythm.

322
00:15:25,120 --> 00:15:26,590
Yeah, they've kept evolving lately.

323
00:15:26,660 --> 00:15:29,090
The rhythm is pretty incredible.

324
00:15:29,160 --> 00:15:30,260
The rhythm?

325
00:15:30,590 --> 00:15:32,960
They don't go just "bzzz"
like the other ones.

326
00:15:34,960 --> 00:15:36,400
It's more like this...

327
00:16:08,500 --> 00:16:10,230
I thought it could match to music.

328
00:16:10,470 --> 00:16:12,370
I feel like you could
put music on this.

329
00:16:12,440 --> 00:16:13,700
With the rhythm?

330
00:16:34,920 --> 00:16:36,130
No way!

331
00:17:00,750 --> 00:17:02,220
Isn't it great?

332
00:17:02,720 --> 00:17:04,620
Really amazing.

333
00:17:05,590 --> 00:17:06,590
What's that?

334
00:17:06,660 --> 00:17:08,220
What's that over there?

335
00:17:09,190 --> 00:17:10,360
Jimmy-san, right?

336
00:17:12,360 --> 00:17:13,900
That's Jimmy-san, right?

337
00:17:14,060 --> 00:17:15,260
You saw that?

338
00:17:15,330 --> 00:17:17,330
Wanna try
how this one vibrates?

339
00:17:51,430 --> 00:17:52,500
Whoa!

340
00:18:05,210 --> 00:18:06,880
That's good, pretty good!

341
00:18:21,260 --> 00:18:22,830
Yay!

342
00:18:23,230 --> 00:18:24,330
Tokyo!

343
00:18:30,740 --> 00:18:31,740
Who are you?

344
00:18:32,010 --> 00:18:33,210
I'm Ujita Minoru. (EN: 4)

345
00:18:53,860 --> 00:18:55,400
What's he doing?

346
00:18:58,670 --> 00:19:00,270
A pretty old-fashioned idiot.

347
00:19:03,140 --> 00:19:04,510
What about the sound?

348
00:19:13,780 --> 00:19:15,120
Want some ice cream?

349
00:19:16,320 --> 00:19:17,350
Ice cream.

350
00:19:17,420 --> 00:19:19,220
Ice cream? Really?

351
00:19:19,720 --> 00:19:21,960
I made it myself.
It's homemade.

352
00:19:23,160 --> 00:19:24,230
You sure?

353
00:19:24,390 --> 00:19:25,530
It's all gooey.

354
00:19:26,660 --> 00:19:27,860
What's this?

355
00:19:28,000 --> 00:19:29,730
Ah, thank you so much.

356
00:19:29,800 --> 00:19:30,930
Is that homemade?

357
00:19:31,170 --> 00:19:32,570
Thank you.

358
00:19:33,400 --> 00:19:34,600
Huh?

359
00:19:36,740 --> 00:19:39,170
Hey! This is lube!
Are you trying to kill me?!

360
00:19:55,590 --> 00:19:57,530
That must be bad for your body, man.

361
00:19:59,560 --> 00:20:01,530
No, lube is fine.
Otherwise...

362
00:20:03,130 --> 00:20:05,430
Workers would end up dying.

363
00:20:05,500 --> 00:20:06,870
It's not something you eat, though.

364
00:20:06,940 --> 00:20:08,900
-This is great!
-Let's do some sumo.

365
00:20:08,970 --> 00:20:10,570
Why sumo right now?
Sumo with lube?

366
00:20:10,640 --> 00:20:12,040
You still have some.

367
00:20:13,080 --> 00:20:14,510
It's sticking all the way there!

368
00:20:15,940 --> 00:20:17,180
Look at that thread!

369
00:20:17,250 --> 00:20:18,610
Do something!

370
00:20:18,680 --> 00:20:20,420
He's really eating it, huh?

371
00:20:21,980 --> 00:20:23,290
I'm feeling sick.

372
00:20:23,350 --> 00:20:25,150
That's gross!

373
00:20:26,460 --> 00:20:27,920
That's too gross!

374
00:20:28,260 --> 00:20:30,330
Stop it, man!

375
00:20:39,770 --> 00:20:41,100
Too close, too close!

376
00:20:52,150 --> 00:20:55,080
Gimme, gimme.
Just once, gimme.

377
00:20:55,150 --> 00:20:56,620
Spit it out.

378
00:20:59,620 --> 00:21:01,390
I want three bowls of rice with this.

379
00:21:04,390 --> 00:21:06,800
Gimme, gimme.

380
00:21:07,860 --> 00:21:09,830
This is awful.

381
00:21:09,900 --> 00:21:12,100
I want four bowls. Five.

382
00:21:14,170 --> 00:21:17,210
I'm gonna stir it all up.
All of it.

383
00:21:26,880 --> 00:21:27,850
Sasaki-san!

384
00:21:29,220 --> 00:21:30,420
Sasaki-san.

385
00:21:31,220 --> 00:21:32,320
Welcome

386
00:21:33,020 --> 00:21:34,090
You look scary!

387
00:21:34,290 --> 00:21:36,560
Well, I'm... I'm Sasaki.

388
00:21:36,660 --> 00:21:37,660
Welcome!

389
00:21:38,130 --> 00:21:40,600
Sasaki-san! Sasaki!

390
00:21:40,760 --> 00:21:42,700
Who the hell are you?

391
00:21:43,870 --> 00:21:44,830
Welcome.

392
00:21:45,570 --> 00:21:46,540
Welcome.

393
00:21:50,270 --> 00:21:53,980
So you're worried
about your bad breath?

394
00:21:55,340 --> 00:21:58,710
Well... yeah, kind of.

395
00:21:58,780 --> 00:22:00,380
Okay, let's take a look then.

396
00:22:00,450 --> 00:22:01,650
Yeah.

397
00:22:08,360 --> 00:22:10,130
Ah, this is it.

398
00:22:10,630 --> 00:22:13,760
Sasaki-san, your tongue
is all covered in moss.

399
00:22:14,060 --> 00:22:15,160
Moss.

400
00:22:15,230 --> 00:22:16,670
Moss on your tongue.

401
00:22:16,730 --> 00:22:17,930
The green one?

402
00:22:18,000 --> 00:22:20,440
Yeah, yeah. That's the smell
on your tongue.

403
00:22:20,640 --> 00:22:21,770
Really?

404
00:22:22,500 --> 00:22:24,340
So let's take it off.

405
00:22:24,610 --> 00:22:26,070
-Right.
-It's for the best.

406
00:22:26,180 --> 00:22:27,210
Thank you very much.

407
00:22:31,310 --> 00:22:32,510
Look.

408
00:22:33,180 --> 00:22:35,420
Don't you puke.
Don't start puking.

409
00:22:36,120 --> 00:22:37,050
Don't do that!

410
00:22:38,720 --> 00:22:40,120
No!

411
00:22:40,190 --> 00:22:42,190
Hold it in,
like a big boy.

412
00:22:42,990 --> 00:22:43,990
Okay?

413
00:22:45,130 --> 00:22:46,090
Look

414
00:22:48,500 --> 00:22:50,900
See? There's a lot of it.

415
00:22:51,430 --> 00:22:53,170
This is what causes the smell. Okay?

416
00:22:58,670 --> 00:23:00,310
Come on!

417
00:23:00,710 --> 00:23:02,110
What did you eat?

418
00:23:05,150 --> 00:23:06,720
No, just an onigiri.

419
00:23:06,780 --> 00:23:08,020
An onigiri?

420
00:23:08,080 --> 00:23:11,150
Definitely not an onigiri.

421
00:23:12,960 --> 00:23:13,960
No, it's just-

422
00:23:14,020 --> 00:23:15,490
This?

423
00:23:28,270 --> 00:23:29,640
Not an onigiri.

424
00:23:29,770 --> 00:23:30,910
It was an onigiri, man.

425
00:23:30,970 --> 00:23:32,510
Is this an onigiri?

426
00:23:33,010 --> 00:23:34,810
I also had some karaage. (EN: 5)

427
00:23:34,880 --> 00:23:38,550
So you eat karaage too?
That's bad, man!

428
00:23:39,210 --> 00:23:40,220
You're eating karaage?

429
00:23:40,280 --> 00:23:41,820
Take that out, please.

430
00:23:45,490 --> 00:23:46,820
Because the onigiri-

431
00:23:48,520 --> 00:23:49,520
Doctor

432
00:23:50,060 --> 00:23:51,060
Excuse me.

433
00:23:52,160 --> 00:23:53,660
I farted earlier

434
00:23:54,960 --> 00:23:58,430
and this came out
of my butt.

435
00:24:00,640 --> 00:24:01,740
Could you take it out?

436
00:24:01,800 --> 00:24:03,540
Please take it out, doctor.

437
00:24:04,410 --> 00:24:05,570
Take a seat.

438
00:24:05,640 --> 00:24:08,540
No, I just farted earlier.

439
00:24:09,410 --> 00:24:12,280
Ouch ouch! What you doin'?!
Stop it, stop!

440
00:24:12,350 --> 00:24:15,250
What're you doin'?!
Stop! Stop it!

441
00:24:15,320 --> 00:24:16,550
What is it? What's wrong?

442
00:24:17,350 --> 00:24:19,290
What happened?
Watch out!

443
00:24:19,660 --> 00:24:22,090
He's for real, come on!

444
00:24:22,360 --> 00:24:25,390
Some random guy.
I barely made it out, though.

445
00:24:25,460 --> 00:24:27,460
He got you in the head?

446
00:24:27,530 --> 00:24:29,530
That was pretty close!

447
00:24:29,930 --> 00:24:31,100
He was pretty serious!

448
00:24:31,170 --> 00:24:32,700
He got you right here.

449
00:24:34,670 --> 00:24:36,270
I'm Super Sansuke! (EN: 6)

450
00:24:37,470 --> 00:24:38,640
No way.

451
00:24:38,970 --> 00:24:39,980
He's here?

452
00:24:40,040 --> 00:24:42,140
Not many people
try a Sansuke impression.

453
00:24:42,540 --> 00:24:44,510
I saw him a couple days ago.

454
00:24:44,650 --> 00:24:46,320
It's sloppy
and the hair's too short.

455
00:24:46,380 --> 00:24:47,820
Too white, too.

456
00:24:48,250 --> 00:24:49,320
You two match.

457
00:24:49,450 --> 00:24:51,320
Nah, I'm fine.

458
00:24:52,020 --> 00:24:53,620
I'm seriously worried.

459
00:24:53,620 --> 00:24:54,620
It's a tiger.

460
00:24:55,620 --> 00:24:57,530
That stinks, man.

461
00:24:57,730 --> 00:25:00,560
That stinks, shit! It stinks!

462
00:25:00,660 --> 00:25:02,800
It's that good old
summer stench.

463
00:25:02,860 --> 00:25:05,200
What kind of smell is that?

464
00:25:06,370 --> 00:25:08,300
For real,
who thinks that?

465
00:25:08,370 --> 00:25:09,400
It smells too bad.

466
00:25:09,470 --> 00:25:11,570
Whoa! Gross!

467
00:25:12,070 --> 00:25:13,140
That stinks!

468
00:25:13,640 --> 00:25:15,340
I'm sure it's not that bad, right?

469
00:25:16,240 --> 00:25:17,610
Damn, damn, it stinks!

470
00:25:17,780 --> 00:25:18,780
Too soon.

471
00:25:23,790 --> 00:25:24,850
Your reaction was too soon.

472
00:25:24,920 --> 00:25:25,790
What?

473
00:25:26,120 --> 00:25:26,920
It just

474
00:25:26,990 --> 00:25:28,560
It was an impulse.

475
00:25:28,960 --> 00:25:30,230
Of course not.

476
00:25:30,760 --> 00:25:32,190
Alright, smell it then!

477
00:25:32,890 --> 00:25:33,930
It stinks!

478
00:25:34,000 --> 00:25:34,830
Too soon.

479
00:25:34,960 --> 00:25:35,930
It was too late.

480
00:25:36,160 --> 00:25:37,030
Too soon.

481
00:25:37,630 --> 00:25:38,700
Too late.

482
00:25:47,710 --> 00:25:49,010
So it's no good?

483
00:25:49,210 --> 00:25:51,610
Not Sansuke?

484
00:25:51,680 --> 00:25:52,680
Sansuke is in trouble.

485
00:25:52,750 --> 00:25:54,120
Not Sansuke?

486
00:25:54,750 --> 00:25:56,420
-It stinks!
Too late!

487
00:25:56,720 --> 00:25:57,850
Too late, huh?

488
00:25:57,920 --> 00:25:59,320
So late I could die.

489
00:26:01,190 --> 00:26:02,290
Doctor...

490
00:26:04,130 --> 00:26:05,390
In your mouth.

491
00:26:21,710 --> 00:26:24,680
I'm sure Yoshimoto will tell us
to stop after eating shit.

492
00:26:42,430 --> 00:26:43,670
Inada is
about to puke.

493
00:26:48,170 --> 00:26:49,440
What's that?

494
00:26:50,010 --> 00:26:51,540
He's just about to puke.

495
00:26:52,870 --> 00:26:54,440
Are you okay, Inada-san?

496
00:26:58,450 --> 00:26:59,650
What's that sound?

497
00:26:59,710 --> 00:27:02,280
I'm trying to fool myself.

498
00:27:02,350 --> 00:27:03,620
To not puke?

499
00:27:03,690 --> 00:27:05,320
Doing that helps?

500
00:27:07,660 --> 00:27:11,760
Nadal, let's do that.
The Nadal reverse.

501
00:27:11,830 --> 00:27:13,600
The Nadal reverse evolution.

502
00:27:13,660 --> 00:27:15,830
It's been a long time, huh?

503
00:27:15,900 --> 00:27:17,570
It can evolve in any way.

504
00:27:17,770 --> 00:27:18,800
Revolution.

505
00:27:18,870 --> 00:27:21,770
If you say "pencil" I can go
"sharpen!" like that.

506
00:27:21,840 --> 00:27:24,540
I can make anything evolve
in Nadal reverse evolution.

507
00:27:24,770 --> 00:27:26,070
Anything goes?

508
00:27:26,170 --> 00:27:27,440
Tissue!

509
00:27:28,080 --> 00:27:31,050
Flowing tissue.

510
00:27:31,550 --> 00:27:34,620
Nadal reverse: Flowing Tissue
Evolution!

511
00:27:34,920 --> 00:27:37,250
It normally doesn't flow,
but this one does down the toilet

512
00:27:38,820 --> 00:27:40,590
That doesn't feel like an evolution.

513
00:27:40,660 --> 00:27:42,260
Okay, the table!

514
00:27:43,190 --> 00:27:46,290
A rotating table.

515
00:27:47,230 --> 00:27:49,230
Nadal reverse evolution!

516
00:27:49,300 --> 00:27:51,030
What's a rotating table?

517
00:27:51,700 --> 00:27:53,670
A table is a table.

518
00:27:54,640 --> 00:27:55,740
Twisted intestines.

519
00:27:56,510 --> 00:27:57,840
Twisted intestines?

520
00:27:59,210 --> 00:28:00,040
Twisted intestines?

521
00:28:00,480 --> 00:28:02,040
It's a disease in your intestines.

522
00:28:02,480 --> 00:28:04,080
Okay... cancer.

523
00:28:04,750 --> 00:28:06,410
Nadal reverse evolution!

524
00:28:06,480 --> 00:28:08,050
So it gets worse?

525
00:28:08,420 --> 00:28:10,120
I thought it would get better.

526
00:28:10,190 --> 00:28:11,190
It's evolving.

527
00:28:11,250 --> 00:28:12,820
So it gets worse.

528
00:28:13,160 --> 00:28:14,190
Trophy!

529
00:28:14,860 --> 00:28:16,660
Uh... gold medal.

530
00:28:16,930 --> 00:28:18,360
What's over there?

531
00:28:19,900 --> 00:28:21,200
What trophy?

532
00:28:21,260 --> 00:28:22,900
No, I wasn't looking at anything.

533
00:28:22,960 --> 00:28:24,300
Miyasako-san. (EN: 7)

534
00:28:26,600 --> 00:28:27,770
Kiyohara.

535
00:28:28,740 --> 00:28:31,040
Nadal reverse evolution.

536
00:28:31,140 --> 00:28:32,440
He evolved?

537
00:28:32,910 --> 00:28:34,610
Is that an evolution?

538
00:28:34,880 --> 00:28:36,240
Criminally, yeah.

539
00:28:36,310 --> 00:28:38,250
Criminally?

540
00:28:38,450 --> 00:28:39,680
Not criminals!

541
00:28:39,750 --> 00:28:41,780
Can you do me?

542
00:28:42,250 --> 00:28:43,420
An evolution?

543
00:28:44,050 --> 00:28:45,090
Something I'm aspiring to.

544
00:28:45,150 --> 00:28:47,390
Let's do that, yeah.

545
00:28:48,760 --> 00:28:50,260
Shimaki Joji. (EN: 8)

546
00:28:50,330 --> 00:28:52,530
Huh? Why?

547
00:28:52,630 --> 00:28:54,030
Evolution.

548
00:28:54,100 --> 00:28:55,200
Gorgeous.

549
00:28:55,630 --> 00:28:57,070
That's good.

550
00:28:57,330 --> 00:28:58,970
Yeah.

551
00:28:59,500 --> 00:29:00,800
Do Koba-san.

552
00:29:01,140 --> 00:29:02,340
An evolution?

553
00:29:05,640 --> 00:29:07,240
Sasaki Kensuke. (EN: 9)

554
00:29:08,310 --> 00:29:10,610
Nadal reverse evolution!

555
00:29:10,710 --> 00:29:12,580
I kinda get it, though.

556
00:29:12,810 --> 00:29:14,320
Why, though?

557
00:29:15,820 --> 00:29:17,120
Okay, Jimmy-san.

558
00:29:19,320 --> 00:29:20,790
Sato Jiro. (EN: 10)

559
00:29:22,260 --> 00:29:24,560
Nadal reverse evolution.

560
00:29:24,960 --> 00:29:25,960
Is that good?

561
00:29:26,030 --> 00:29:27,460
I think so, yeah.

562
00:29:28,200 --> 00:29:29,500
Yeah, I think so.

563
00:29:29,600 --> 00:29:32,170
It's not an evolution, just a lookalike.

564
00:29:32,530 --> 00:29:34,500
Is there like a devolution?

565
00:29:34,570 --> 00:29:36,610
I've never done that.

566
00:29:36,710 --> 00:29:39,540
He might go off the deep end then.

567
00:29:39,610 --> 00:29:42,810
Let's go with a devolution!

568
00:29:43,010 --> 00:29:44,250
Pencil!

569
00:29:44,310 --> 00:29:47,250
Uh... trash.

570
00:29:48,680 --> 00:29:50,020
Trash?

571
00:29:50,250 --> 00:29:51,450
That works with everything.

572
00:29:51,720 --> 00:29:54,860
It's the same for everything.

573
00:29:55,090 --> 00:29:57,130
It's kinda like philosophical.

574
00:29:57,460 --> 00:29:58,830
Okay, Jimmy-san.

575
00:30:01,060 --> 00:30:02,330
Uh...

576
00:30:08,400 --> 00:30:10,110
Matsuo Bannai. (EN: 11)

577
00:30:11,040 --> 00:30:13,110
Yeah, we don't look alike.

578
00:30:13,740 --> 00:30:15,240
Isn't Bannai-san older?

579
00:30:15,310 --> 00:30:16,910
We're contemporaries.

580
00:30:17,080 --> 00:30:18,780
Then it's not a devolution.

581
00:30:19,210 --> 00:30:20,280
It's not a devolution!

582
00:30:20,580 --> 00:30:22,050
That's not a devolution.

583
00:30:22,420 --> 00:30:23,950
Bannai-san is way better.

584
00:30:28,660 --> 00:30:29,660
A sekitori? (EN: 12)

585
00:30:31,390 --> 00:30:33,190
Where are you going?

586
00:30:33,260 --> 00:30:34,700
You can't go that way.

587
00:30:34,760 --> 00:30:35,800
No way.

588
00:30:35,860 --> 00:30:37,070
What was that?

589
00:30:37,130 --> 00:30:37,970
Huh?

590
00:30:38,630 --> 00:30:40,070
What are you a grandpa?

591
00:30:40,470 --> 00:30:41,500
Where are you going?

592
00:30:41,970 --> 00:30:43,170
A grandpa?

593
00:30:43,710 --> 00:30:45,810
Um... so...

594
00:30:45,870 --> 00:30:46,880
The strobes?

595
00:30:46,940 --> 00:30:48,480
Yeah, I want to project...

596
00:30:48,540 --> 00:30:49,680
This way. This way.

597
00:30:49,740 --> 00:30:50,780
Ah, that way?

598
00:30:50,980 --> 00:30:52,050
And then turn left.

599
00:30:52,110 --> 00:30:53,550
What's this all of a sudden?

600
00:30:53,950 --> 00:30:55,920
I want you all
to see something.

601
00:30:55,980 --> 00:30:57,320
Ah you wanna do something?

602
00:30:57,390 --> 00:30:58,350
We'll watch

603
00:30:58,420 --> 00:30:59,450
I'm gonna do something.

604
00:31:00,060 --> 00:31:01,060
Show you something.

605
00:31:01,390 --> 00:31:02,860
Of course,
just do it.

606
00:31:02,920 --> 00:31:04,460
Okay, I'm gonna show you.

607
00:31:04,530 --> 00:31:06,390
Maybe we'll learn something.

608
00:31:07,330 --> 00:31:09,630
You can go this way?

609
00:31:10,600 --> 00:31:11,570
That way.

610
00:31:11,670 --> 00:31:12,630
This way.

611
00:31:13,030 --> 00:31:14,940
Devolution? Devolution...

612
00:31:15,840 --> 00:31:18,210
What is Nadal reverse evolution
devolved?

613
00:31:18,670 --> 00:31:19,970
It'd be Nadal reverse.

614
00:31:21,410 --> 00:31:23,550
-Do it with a better voice.
-What about Nadal reverse?

615
00:31:24,380 --> 00:31:25,410
If it devolved?

616
00:31:26,550 --> 00:31:27,850
"Nanno"

617
00:31:33,420 --> 00:31:34,890
That's Nadal reverse devolved?

618
00:31:35,190 --> 00:31:36,520
"Nanno"

619
00:31:39,830 --> 00:31:41,530
-What's that?
-Nanno

620
00:31:41,600 --> 00:31:43,970
That's not funny.
Who does that?

621
00:31:44,030 --> 00:31:45,000
Cashew nuts

622
00:31:45,400 --> 00:31:46,700
No, pistachio.

623
00:31:47,940 --> 00:31:49,270
"Nanno"?

624
00:31:49,340 --> 00:31:50,940
What are we going to eat?

625
00:31:51,070 --> 00:31:52,810
He's pretty serious, huh?!

626
00:31:52,870 --> 00:31:54,380
You're impressive.

627
00:31:54,880 --> 00:31:56,950
I'm hungry. Wanna order something?

628
00:31:57,980 --> 00:31:59,810
Take that.

629
00:31:59,880 --> 00:32:01,380
I'm starving.

630
00:32:02,350 --> 00:32:03,120
Let's choose.

631
00:32:07,720 --> 00:32:10,860
Look at that. Ina-chan.

632
00:32:18,200 --> 00:32:21,670
Rock paper scissors
Rock paper scissors

633
00:32:21,740 --> 00:32:25,040
What can you make?
What can you make?

634
00:32:25,110 --> 00:32:28,640
Right hand is a claw.
Left hand is a claw too.

635
00:32:28,710 --> 00:32:33,210
We go shrimping.
We go shrimping. We go shrimping.

636
00:32:33,280 --> 00:32:34,280
What's that?

637
00:32:34,350 --> 00:32:37,590
Rock paper scissors
Rock paper scissors.

638
00:32:37,650 --> 00:32:41,120
What can you make?
What can you make?

639
00:32:41,190 --> 00:32:45,090
One on the right
One on the left

640
00:32:46,800 --> 00:32:51,830
Eye crushing,
eye crushing, eye crushing.

641
00:32:52,370 --> 00:32:55,870
Rock paper scissors
Rock paper scissors

642
00:32:55,940 --> 00:32:59,040
What can you make?
What can you make?

643
00:32:59,340 --> 00:33:03,650
Right hand goes here
Left hand goes-

644
00:33:04,010 --> 00:33:06,780
Feeling empty

645
00:33:07,820 --> 00:33:10,720
Feeling empty

646
00:33:10,990 --> 00:33:13,150
He can keep a straight face?

647
00:33:13,720 --> 00:33:15,660
Feeling empty

648
00:33:17,290 --> 00:33:18,560
Do that here!

649
00:33:19,760 --> 00:33:21,660
What about the strobes?

650
00:33:22,430 --> 00:33:23,930
I wanted to see the strobes.

651
00:33:24,000 --> 00:33:25,570
Should've done that here.

652
00:33:26,130 --> 00:33:28,670
Jimmy-san!
Use the strobes!

653
00:33:28,740 --> 00:33:32,140
I think he's getting serious
so don't start nagging!

654
00:33:32,210 --> 00:33:33,640
You didn't use the strobes.

655
00:33:34,640 --> 00:33:36,540
Do it with the strobes
one more time.

656
00:33:36,610 --> 00:33:40,110
Didn't you go to check
the strobes back there?

657
00:33:40,250 --> 00:33:42,950
I'll do it again with the strobes.

658
00:33:45,750 --> 00:33:47,160
He was looking for them.

659
00:33:47,220 --> 00:33:49,320
That would be a dramatic change.

660
00:34:00,700 --> 00:34:02,200
I'll do some ventriloquism.

661
00:34:04,310 --> 00:34:05,370
Good day!

662
00:34:06,410 --> 00:34:09,580
This would've been better
with no strobes, definitely.

663
00:34:10,040 --> 00:34:12,950
The rhythm is all off, too.

664
00:34:13,010 --> 00:34:15,180
It should be faster.

665
00:34:15,250 --> 00:34:18,450
This is probably the worst thing
you could do with strobes.

666
00:34:18,520 --> 00:34:20,360
Jimmy-san is all wrong about this.

667
00:34:20,420 --> 00:34:22,690
It's impossible to tell the movements...

668
00:34:22,760 --> 00:34:24,060
My right hand!

669
00:34:25,290 --> 00:34:26,760
My eyes...

670
00:34:26,930 --> 00:34:28,260
My eyes hurt.

671
00:34:29,030 --> 00:34:30,330
A question.

672
00:34:31,370 --> 00:34:33,540
Who built Osaka Castle?

673
00:34:34,600 --> 00:34:35,770
That's the end?

674
00:34:36,870 --> 00:34:38,010
Jimmy-san.

675
00:34:38,340 --> 00:34:39,940
Wait, that was too hard to see.

676
00:34:40,070 --> 00:34:41,410
My eyes hurt.

677
00:34:41,710 --> 00:34:43,280
You see, ventriloquism...

678
00:34:43,340 --> 00:34:44,580
I was doing ventriloquism.

679
00:34:44,850 --> 00:34:45,950
It was great

680
00:34:46,010 --> 00:34:49,620
But we couldn't see your awesomeness
because of the strobes.

681
00:34:49,680 --> 00:34:50,790
Yeah, yeah!

682
00:34:51,550 --> 00:34:52,650
It was all wrong.

683
00:34:52,720 --> 00:34:54,790
You should do it here

684
00:34:54,860 --> 00:34:57,430
We could see if you did it right here.

685
00:34:57,490 --> 00:34:58,790
Alright, then let's do it here.

686
00:34:58,990 --> 00:35:00,800
Alright, can I do it?

687
00:35:00,860 --> 00:35:01,860
Yeah.

688
00:35:03,800 --> 00:35:05,570
Okay, one question!

689
00:35:05,730 --> 00:35:09,070
Sure!
I'll answer anything!

690
00:35:09,570 --> 00:35:10,870
His mouth is moving.

691
00:35:10,940 --> 00:35:11,910
It's moving?

692
00:35:11,970 --> 00:35:14,310
Who built Osaka Castle?

693
00:35:15,140 --> 00:35:16,780
Toyotomi Hideyoshi.

694
00:35:18,010 --> 00:35:20,780
And who built Edo Castle?

695
00:35:20,880 --> 00:35:21,880
Yeah.

696
00:35:23,080 --> 00:35:24,750
Tokugawa Ieyasu.

697
00:35:24,820 --> 00:35:25,920
Yeah.

698
00:35:26,450 --> 00:35:28,160
Tokugawa Ieyasu.

699
00:35:29,490 --> 00:35:32,160
It's 8:45 right now.

700
00:35:34,600 --> 00:35:36,160
How should I attack?

701
00:35:39,100 --> 00:35:41,600
What's the right attack?

702
00:35:43,540 --> 00:35:44,710
Eight...

703
00:35:46,670 --> 00:35:47,980
Beep

704
00:35:48,710 --> 00:35:49,740
Beep...

705
00:35:50,750 --> 00:35:52,050
Eight...

706
00:35:54,020 --> 00:35:55,380
Forty five...

707
00:35:56,880 --> 00:35:58,290
One minute

708
00:36:00,150 --> 00:36:01,120
One minute

709
00:36:06,160 --> 00:36:07,830
It's 8:46.

710
00:36:08,900 --> 00:36:09,900
Huh?

711
00:36:10,100 --> 00:36:11,300
What?

712
00:36:12,370 --> 00:36:13,900
I should've attacked instead.

713
00:36:13,970 --> 00:36:15,900
Well, it's just...
What's going on?

714
00:36:15,970 --> 00:36:18,210
He'll answer correctly.

715
00:36:18,270 --> 00:36:20,170
Ah, he hasn't answered yet?

716
00:36:20,240 --> 00:36:21,840
No, not yet...

717
00:36:21,980 --> 00:36:23,380
He's gonna answer correctly then?

718
00:36:23,440 --> 00:36:24,680
He hasn't yet.

719
00:36:25,180 --> 00:36:26,450
Ah, he's gonna?

720
00:36:26,510 --> 00:36:27,520
I see!

721
00:36:27,620 --> 00:36:29,980
Don't stop him halfway there.

722
00:36:30,320 --> 00:36:31,650
Answer quickly.

723
00:36:31,720 --> 00:36:34,760
How should I attack at 8:45?

724
00:36:35,160 --> 00:36:37,090
I don't know
about that...

725
00:36:38,090 --> 00:36:39,690
Not by the hourglass

726
00:36:42,460 --> 00:36:45,270
I see, that's true.

727
00:36:46,070 --> 00:36:49,800
Eight... wait...
What's this about?

728
00:36:52,140 --> 00:36:55,080
The hourglass looked
just like 8:45

729
00:36:55,480 --> 00:36:58,510
The hourglass looked like 8:45?

730
00:36:58,580 --> 00:36:59,910
Because it's two circles?

731
00:36:59,980 --> 00:37:01,350
Yeah yeah

732
00:37:01,420 --> 00:37:02,780
The eight

733
00:37:02,850 --> 00:37:05,250
The shape's like an eight? Then 45?

734
00:37:05,320 --> 00:37:06,920
The 45 is on its side.

735
00:37:06,990 --> 00:37:09,120
Where? What's that about?

736
00:37:09,190 --> 00:37:10,830
I don't get it.

737
00:37:10,890 --> 00:37:13,360
Did you smoke some pot back there?

738
00:37:13,430 --> 00:37:15,030
Huh? Pot?

739
00:37:15,400 --> 00:37:16,760
You're fucking crazy.

740
00:37:16,830 --> 00:37:18,670
You've been weird since then.

741
00:37:18,770 --> 00:37:20,270
Pretty insane.

742
00:37:20,500 --> 00:37:24,210
That's some clean posture.

743
00:37:25,470 --> 00:37:26,770
You did ballet or something?

744
00:37:26,910 --> 00:37:28,010
Baseball.

745
00:37:28,080 --> 00:37:30,450
Your leg posture is clean.

746
00:37:30,550 --> 00:37:31,680
Hello

747
00:37:31,750 --> 00:37:33,210
Ah damn it!

748
00:37:33,380 --> 00:37:35,080
This is serious!

749
00:37:35,150 --> 00:37:38,650
I'll answer anything about
the show business! (EN: 13)

750
00:37:38,720 --> 00:37:40,320
Show business?

751
00:37:41,820 --> 00:37:42,820
You curious?

752
00:37:42,890 --> 00:37:44,060
Yeah!

753
00:37:44,590 --> 00:37:45,790
You too?

754
00:37:46,360 --> 00:37:48,330
That's not really great.

755
00:37:50,830 --> 00:37:53,470
What's the future of
Johnny & Associates?

756
00:37:53,840 --> 00:37:56,070
Who should answer?

757
00:37:56,570 --> 00:37:58,470
Kubota-san's...

758
00:37:58,740 --> 00:37:59,940
Why do I have to-

759
00:38:00,010 --> 00:38:01,740
Makoto, Makoto.

760
00:38:01,810 --> 00:38:03,510
What?
Makoto.

761
00:38:03,640 --> 00:38:05,110
The name's Makoto.

762
00:38:08,680 --> 00:38:11,190
What's gonna happen to
Johnny & Associates?

763
00:38:11,250 --> 00:38:12,250
It's gonna collapse.

764
00:38:12,920 --> 00:38:14,290
It collapsed yesterday.

765
00:38:14,360 --> 00:38:15,260
Yesterday?

766
00:38:15,490 --> 00:38:16,760
It didn't, though!

767
00:38:16,820 --> 00:38:18,360
Is that true, Makoto-kun?

768
00:38:19,230 --> 00:38:22,200
They replaced their windows.

769
00:38:22,400 --> 00:38:24,470
What?
They replaced their windows.

770
00:38:24,530 --> 00:38:25,570
Windows?

771
00:38:25,970 --> 00:38:27,640
Ask any question! Go on!

772
00:38:28,270 --> 00:38:30,940
Okay, so about the entertainment industry...

773
00:38:31,010 --> 00:38:34,040
what actor likes to pretend
they're an MC?

774
00:38:34,140 --> 00:38:36,280
Pocaskajan.

775
00:38:36,640 --> 00:38:37,650
Huh?

776
00:38:37,810 --> 00:38:39,110
Pocaskajan!

777
00:38:39,280 --> 00:38:41,550
Pocaskajan? The trio?

778
00:38:41,620 --> 00:38:43,380
From Wahaha Hompo?

779
00:38:43,480 --> 00:38:45,620
Pocaskajan will take over
the world of comedy.

780
00:38:45,750 --> 00:38:47,320
You agree, Makoto-kun?

781
00:38:48,460 --> 00:38:50,060
Makoto-kun does, yes.

782
00:38:51,490 --> 00:38:52,490
Yes.

783
00:38:52,890 --> 00:38:54,100
You think so?

784
00:38:55,400 --> 00:38:56,960
Okay, go ahead!

785
00:38:57,030 --> 00:39:00,270
What woman could I hit on
in the show business?

786
00:39:01,200 --> 00:39:02,570
Kudo Shizuka.

787
00:39:02,640 --> 00:39:03,600
Huh?!

788
00:39:03,670 --> 00:39:05,070
Kudo Shizuka-san!

789
00:39:05,470 --> 00:39:07,040
No way!

790
00:39:07,340 --> 00:39:08,710
No way, man!

791
00:39:10,280 --> 00:39:12,480
What big couple's
gonna get married soon?

792
00:39:12,850 --> 00:39:14,380
Let's ask Makoto-kun.

793
00:39:16,350 --> 00:39:18,750
Married soon?

794
00:39:19,890 --> 00:39:21,190
A big couple...

795
00:39:21,790 --> 00:39:23,260
Can I say?

796
00:39:24,390 --> 00:39:25,830
Mihara Junko-san and...

797
00:39:26,330 --> 00:39:27,630
Hashi Yukio-san.

798
00:39:28,900 --> 00:39:30,100
That's unexpected.

799
00:39:30,360 --> 00:39:32,370
Weird choice.

800
00:39:32,800 --> 00:39:35,200
Who's the strongest
performer out there?

801
00:39:35,270 --> 00:39:36,400
The strongest fighter.

802
00:39:36,470 --> 00:39:38,040
The strongest fighting performer.

803
00:39:38,210 --> 00:39:39,340
I'm curious.

804
00:39:39,510 --> 00:39:40,840
They're asking you.

805
00:39:41,480 --> 00:39:42,580
Makoto-kun.

806
00:39:43,480 --> 00:39:45,150
The strongest performer.

807
00:39:46,250 --> 00:39:49,180
Eh... the strongest performer is...

808
00:39:49,980 --> 00:39:53,490
Um... Giant Baba

809
00:39:55,620 --> 00:39:56,960
What should I say?

810
00:39:57,020 --> 00:39:59,290
Makoto-kun, what do you mean?

811
00:39:59,630 --> 00:40:01,660
He's dead,
Makoto-kun.

812
00:40:01,830 --> 00:40:04,330
I'm sorry!

813
00:40:05,070 --> 00:40:06,870
Nadal, can you
borrow Makoto-kun?

814
00:40:12,070 --> 00:40:13,070
What?

815
00:40:20,310 --> 00:40:23,050
What what?

816
00:40:25,720 --> 00:40:27,260
Ventriloquism.

817
00:40:28,760 --> 00:40:30,760
Hello. I'm Jimmy.

818
00:40:31,130 --> 00:40:32,190
Jimmy-kun...

819
00:40:34,000 --> 00:40:35,000
He's not talking at all.

820
00:40:35,060 --> 00:40:36,360
Hello, I'm Jimmy.

821
00:40:37,100 --> 00:40:38,100
Who's talking?

822
00:40:38,170 --> 00:40:40,840
I'm sorry. This is my doll
Jimmy-kun.

823
00:40:41,100 --> 00:40:43,440
I can do ventriloquism
without moving my mouth.

824
00:40:43,500 --> 00:40:45,010
Ask anything
and he'll answer.

825
00:40:47,110 --> 00:40:48,980
I'll answer anything!

826
00:40:49,710 --> 00:40:51,210
Even anything about you?

827
00:40:51,350 --> 00:40:53,210
Yeah, of course! Go on!

828
00:40:53,480 --> 00:40:57,150
Jimmy-kun, what's the worst thing
you've done so far?

829
00:40:58,050 --> 00:41:00,220
Okay. Pyromania.

830
00:41:02,690 --> 00:41:06,930
That's cute.
Pyromania is cute.

831
00:41:07,560 --> 00:41:08,660
You lit things on fire?

832
00:41:08,900 --> 00:41:09,900
Yes!

833
00:41:09,960 --> 00:41:10,970
Where?

834
00:41:11,900 --> 00:41:14,140
All over the place.

835
00:41:14,200 --> 00:41:15,370
You're evil!

836
00:41:17,070 --> 00:41:18,370
He's pretty serious!

837
00:41:18,440 --> 00:41:20,240
What's the most fun
you've had so far?

838
00:41:21,240 --> 00:41:22,280
Okay

839
00:41:22,980 --> 00:41:24,910
The first time I peeled my skin off.

840
00:41:25,080 --> 00:41:26,050
Huh?

841
00:41:26,110 --> 00:41:27,420
Skin

842
00:41:27,780 --> 00:41:29,680
Your dick's?
Yes!

843
00:41:29,920 --> 00:41:31,420
You like touching your dick?

844
00:41:31,850 --> 00:41:33,020
I love it.

845
00:41:33,120 --> 00:41:34,690
It didn't hurt
when you peeled it off?

846
00:41:35,220 --> 00:41:36,660
It hurt

847
00:41:37,190 --> 00:41:40,230
but it felt really good later.

848
00:41:40,630 --> 00:41:44,200
So it feels great
after it hurts a little.

849
00:41:45,030 --> 00:41:47,100
Did something come out?
Yes!

850
00:41:47,170 --> 00:41:49,400
What came out?
Okay...

851
00:41:49,470 --> 00:41:50,710
Tell us!
Yes!

852
00:41:53,010 --> 00:41:54,410
Maracas.

853
00:41:54,480 --> 00:41:56,240
What do you mean maracas?

854
00:41:57,040 --> 00:41:59,110
It's over it's over.
We're done here.

855
00:41:59,780 --> 00:42:01,450
It's over once
maracas show up.

856
00:42:01,520 --> 00:42:02,920
This is for training.

857
00:42:02,980 --> 00:42:05,120
Ina-chan, you have
any complexes?

858
00:42:06,190 --> 00:42:07,120
He does?

859
00:42:09,220 --> 00:42:12,090
Well you see... it's about my nipples.

860
00:42:12,530 --> 00:42:15,130
Many people have complexes
about their nipples.

861
00:42:15,230 --> 00:42:17,060
I can see something.

862
00:42:17,530 --> 00:42:18,530
A complex?

863
00:42:18,600 --> 00:42:21,270
Jimmy-san, Inada says
he has a complex.

864
00:42:22,000 --> 00:42:23,570
They're too dark

865
00:42:24,770 --> 00:42:25,770
and huge.

866
00:42:25,910 --> 00:42:27,210
Dark and huge?

867
00:42:27,710 --> 00:42:32,080
It's so ugly, I've turned down
all nude job offers so far.

868
00:42:32,980 --> 00:42:34,020
Show us.

869
00:42:34,650 --> 00:42:37,450
It's probably not so bad
if you can show other people.

870
00:42:37,520 --> 00:42:39,850
Take a close look.
It's serious.

871
00:42:39,920 --> 00:42:41,260
All of a sudden...

872
00:42:41,620 --> 00:42:42,820
Here we go.

873
00:42:43,320 --> 00:42:44,660
Here we go?

874
00:42:47,130 --> 00:42:48,230
Huh? What?

875
00:42:49,960 --> 00:42:51,370
They're pretty.

876
00:42:51,400 --> 00:42:52,400
Huh?

877
00:42:52,470 --> 00:42:54,100
How are they dark and big?

878
00:42:54,170 --> 00:42:55,440
They're pale!

879
00:42:59,340 --> 00:43:00,510
Pale!

880
00:43:01,410 --> 00:43:02,410
I can't tell them apart!

881
00:43:02,480 --> 00:43:04,450
Those would look good
on a girl!

882
00:43:04,950 --> 00:43:06,250
They're good looking!

883
00:43:06,310 --> 00:43:08,650
Your mom's tits
were pretty, right?

884
00:43:08,880 --> 00:43:11,590
No, my mom's normal.

885
00:43:11,650 --> 00:43:12,650
Normal?

886
00:43:12,720 --> 00:43:14,260
I'm sure they're pretty.

887
00:43:15,520 --> 00:43:17,660
Are they inverted?
Those are pretty tits.

888
00:43:17,730 --> 00:43:19,160
They have no color.

889
00:43:20,360 --> 00:43:21,800
Completely transparent.

890
00:43:23,000 --> 00:43:24,500
That's unusual.

891
00:43:24,600 --> 00:43:27,130
They're really light.

892
00:43:27,200 --> 00:43:28,440
That one's getting hard.

893
00:43:28,500 --> 00:43:29,500
Hard?

894
00:43:29,570 --> 00:43:31,140
Well, I haven't done anything.

895
00:43:31,910 --> 00:43:33,340
They're probably inverted nipples.

896
00:43:34,810 --> 00:43:35,810
They're not.

897
00:43:35,880 --> 00:43:37,650
It's hard with your hands.

898
00:43:37,710 --> 00:43:39,410
Okay,
wanna use some lube?

899
00:43:40,750 --> 00:43:42,580
Don't be so reckless
with Ina-san, okay?

900
00:43:42,650 --> 00:43:44,250
Wait, wait. Stop.

901
00:43:45,090 --> 00:43:47,820
It's fine.
Lube is a natural product.

902
00:43:47,960 --> 00:43:49,120
Is your skin okay?

903
00:43:50,020 --> 00:43:51,330
Can you get it even harder?

904
00:43:59,430 --> 00:44:01,040
It's not getting harder.

905
00:44:01,200 --> 00:44:02,440
Not like this?

906
00:44:02,670 --> 00:44:05,370
Make it get harder!
Like a real man!

907
00:44:05,810 --> 00:44:06,840
Koumoto-san...

908
00:44:06,910 --> 00:44:08,680
Is this too weak?
I'm gonna do it harder.

909
00:44:08,740 --> 00:44:11,450
Koumoto-san, make him a man.

910
00:44:12,710 --> 00:44:13,480
It's getting harder.

911
00:44:13,550 --> 00:44:15,220
For real, it is!

912
00:44:15,520 --> 00:44:16,550
For real!

913
00:44:16,780 --> 00:44:19,720
Hurry hurry!
Do it more!

914
00:44:23,820 --> 00:44:25,090
How is it?

915
00:44:27,960 --> 00:44:29,460
I'm close!

916
00:44:29,600 --> 00:44:30,970
You came?

917
00:44:31,730 --> 00:44:34,500
I'm feeling more sensitive.

918
00:44:36,170 --> 00:44:37,370
Look! No way!

919
00:44:37,770 --> 00:44:38,970
This one's different!

920
00:44:41,140 --> 00:44:42,140
He came?

921
00:44:42,210 --> 00:44:43,680
Not so slow?

922
00:44:44,650 --> 00:44:48,020
Turn it
and open like a screwdriver.

923
00:44:48,180 --> 00:44:49,180
Like a screwdriver...

924
00:44:49,280 --> 00:44:50,720
Turn right.

925
00:44:50,780 --> 00:44:51,890
Can I turn it around?

926
00:44:55,560 --> 00:44:56,490
I'm closing it?

927
00:44:56,560 --> 00:44:58,690
Ouch! Ouch!

928
00:44:58,760 --> 00:45:00,090
I'll open up, sorry.

929
00:45:00,160 --> 00:45:01,430
Open open open!

930
00:45:01,500 --> 00:45:05,600
It's getting loose
It's getting loose!

931
00:45:05,770 --> 00:45:06,930
There it is!

932
00:45:07,170 --> 00:45:08,500
It's hard for sure!

933
00:45:08,570 --> 00:45:09,470
Just twist it!

934
00:45:09,540 --> 00:45:10,570
Thank you very much!

935
00:45:10,800 --> 00:45:12,010
Thank you!

936
00:45:12,070 --> 00:45:13,110
Sure!

937
00:45:13,340 --> 00:45:14,540
Huh?

938
00:45:15,210 --> 00:45:16,410
There we go!

939
00:45:20,550 --> 00:45:21,550
That's it!

940
00:45:21,650 --> 00:45:23,020
He smiled naturally.

941
00:45:23,780 --> 00:45:24,890
There we go.

942
00:45:31,160 --> 00:45:32,630
Don't fuck with me, Kubota.

943
00:45:32,690 --> 00:45:34,530
Someone's finally out.

944
00:45:35,300 --> 00:45:37,100
Took us long enough.

945
00:45:37,630 --> 00:45:39,100
Took you long enough, huh?!

946
00:45:41,000 --> 00:45:43,370
It was practically
a stalemate!

947
00:45:43,440 --> 00:45:47,140
So Cookie smiled
naturally, right?

948
00:45:47,210 --> 00:45:48,240
He smiled naturally.

949
00:45:48,310 --> 00:45:49,310
Like it was obvious.

950
00:45:49,380 --> 00:45:50,480
He smiled like it was obvious.

951
00:45:50,580 --> 00:45:53,850
Of course I'd smile
with that face in front of me.

952
00:45:57,890 --> 00:45:59,020
Open it.

953
00:45:59,090 --> 00:46:00,390
I'll open it up. Sorry.

954
00:46:00,490 --> 00:46:01,720
Open open open!

955
00:46:01,790 --> 00:46:05,690
It's getting loose
It's getting loose!

956
00:46:06,060 --> 00:46:07,190
There we go!

957
00:46:07,360 --> 00:46:08,760
It's hard for sure!

958
00:46:08,830 --> 00:46:09,730
Just twist it!

959
00:46:09,800 --> 00:46:10,800
Thank you very much!

960
00:46:11,070 --> 00:46:12,270
Thank you!

961
00:46:12,330 --> 00:46:13,500
Sure.

962
00:46:13,570 --> 00:46:14,670
Huh?!

963
00:46:17,170 --> 00:46:18,540
It's pretty obvious!

964
00:46:19,640 --> 00:46:23,140
Just like a regular helper!

965
00:46:26,680 --> 00:46:28,120
So Cookie!

966
00:46:28,820 --> 00:46:30,120
You're out!

967
00:46:35,960 --> 00:46:36,960
Damn it!

968
00:46:37,020 --> 00:46:40,260
But Cookie might still
come back as a zombie.

969
00:46:40,490 --> 00:46:42,160
It could happen.

970
00:46:42,530 --> 00:46:44,030
I'm gonna take you all down!

971
00:46:45,870 --> 00:46:48,670
I was surprised by
Ina-chan's nipples.

972
00:46:49,240 --> 00:46:50,240
It was impressive.

973
00:46:50,300 --> 00:46:51,370
For sure, yeah.

974
00:46:51,440 --> 00:46:52,510
They've been like that forever.

975
00:46:52,570 --> 00:46:54,140
Like a nordic girl's.

976
00:46:54,510 --> 00:46:55,510
For real!

977
00:46:55,580 --> 00:46:57,210
An eastern block country.

978
00:46:57,710 --> 00:47:00,280
Thank you all!

979
00:47:00,650 --> 00:47:01,980
Nine left.

980
00:47:02,480 --> 00:47:04,490
It's hard, for sure.

981
00:47:04,550 --> 00:47:07,020
I tend to forget the feeling.

982
00:47:07,090 --> 00:47:10,220
I also laughed a lot my first time

983
00:47:10,290 --> 00:47:13,560
but when I won,
I somehow managed to hold it.

984
00:47:13,630 --> 00:47:16,130
But I completely let go

985
00:47:16,200 --> 00:47:18,130
of that holding back feeling.

986
00:47:22,340 --> 00:47:23,600
Thank you very much.

987
00:47:23,670 --> 00:47:24,810
Sure.

988
00:47:24,940 --> 00:47:29,240
It's rough to have comedy be
like all or nothing.

989
00:47:30,180 --> 00:47:32,950
Though I guess I got nothing this time.

990
00:47:35,580 --> 00:47:37,650
I think it's perfectly fine!

991
00:47:37,720 --> 00:47:39,390
It's fine, yeah!

992
00:47:39,450 --> 00:47:40,590
No problems.

993
00:47:40,650 --> 00:47:42,260
No problems, right?

994
00:47:42,590 --> 00:47:44,220
And the nudity too

995
00:47:44,930 --> 00:47:47,330
It was relatively tame

996
00:47:47,390 --> 00:47:48,900
Compared to previous seasons?

997
00:47:50,260 --> 00:47:51,370
For real, yeah!

998
00:47:51,430 --> 00:47:53,700
There was almost no nudity.

999
00:47:53,770 --> 00:47:58,070
We just battled with pure laughter
that's what it feels like.

1000
00:47:58,210 --> 00:48:00,670
Nudity like that
is tamer than idol pictures.

1001
00:48:00,740 --> 00:48:02,510
You could even sell it.

1002
00:48:02,740 --> 00:48:04,550
Who'd wanna look at that?!

1003
00:48:04,610 --> 00:48:05,750
Strip more!

1004
00:48:05,810 --> 00:48:07,750
That was the complaint?!

1005
00:48:08,120 --> 00:48:09,750
They wanted more skin?!

1006
00:48:09,820 --> 00:48:11,020
That was it?

1007
00:48:11,090 --> 00:48:12,990
Because Ina-chan's nipples
looked so good!

1008
00:48:13,820 --> 00:48:16,560
They didn't want something
so clean!

1009
00:48:16,760 --> 00:48:17,930
They wanted filth!

1010
00:48:18,130 --> 00:48:19,230
We didn't need this!

1011
00:48:20,430 --> 00:48:22,460
Amazon has their bar too high!

1012
00:48:23,100 --> 00:48:24,100
That's true, yeah.

1013
00:48:24,200 --> 00:48:26,230
There was nothing wrong.

1014
00:48:27,430 --> 00:48:28,700
Nothing, right?

1015
00:48:29,070 --> 00:48:30,600
I don't get it at all!

1016
00:48:30,800 --> 00:48:33,040
It was as fun as
a Jackie Chan movie.

1017
00:48:33,410 --> 00:48:35,280
The action of laughter.
