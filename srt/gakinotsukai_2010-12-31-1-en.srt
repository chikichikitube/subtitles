with another "No Laughing" series

45
00:01:28,900 --> 00:01:32,150
I was really hoping *ARASHI would do the show this year but...

46
00:01:28,900 --> 00:01:35,420
*ARASHI = 5-member Boy Band

47
00:01:32,150 --> 00:01:33,680
But they chickened out on us

48
00:01:33,680 --> 00:01:35,560
No, ARASHI took the gig at NHK

49
00:01:34,940 --> 00:01:36,890
That's right

50
00:01:37,410 --> 00:01:39,940
Well, our version of ARASHI can do the job then

51
00:01:42,110 --> 00:01:43,650
We're the ARASHI of Yoshimoto Co.

52
00:01:43,650 --> 00:01:46,580
We're like IGARASHI

53
00:01:46,920 --> 00:01:49,090
50 times better than ARASHI

54
00:01:49,710 --> 00:01:55,730
This year's theme is "Spy"

55
00:01:53,080 --> 00:01:55,540
Why do we have be spies anyway?

56
00:01:55,730 --> 00:01:59,110
And who says spies can't laugh?

57
00:01:59,520 --> 00:02:02,050
It was a tough day as usual

58
00:02:02,050 --> 00:02:04,570
And that weather...

59
00:02:03,470 --> 00:02:05,100
It was wet and cold like every other year

60
00:02:04,570 --> 00:02:09,170
One of us must be inviting the rain

61
00:02:09,320 --> 00:02:10,900
Yeah, you need to knock it off!

62
00:02:11,300 --> 00:02:12,380
Hosei-san, it's you

63
00:02:12,380 --> 00:02:14,850
No, I bring sunny days!

64
00:02:13,940 --> 00:02:14,830
I don't believe it

65
00:02:14,850 --> 00:02:18,320
I'm guessing it's you, Hamada-san

66
00:02:16,480 --> 00:02:17,550
Why me?

67
00:02:17,550 --> 00:02:21,530
Right, why is it Hamada's fault that it always rains?!

68
00:02:19,950 --> 00:02:23,740
Seriously, why me?

69
00:02:24,260 --> 00:02:25,230
OK, hear me out then

70
00:02:25,230 --> 00:02:26,060
Go ahead

71
00:02:26,060 --> 00:02:31,200
Well, I saw an ad for your coffee on a vending machine

72
00:02:31,200 --> 00:02:35,360
And your face with the blue background shows

73
00:02:35,360 --> 00:02:37,230
you're the type who brings rain!

74
00:02:37,470 --> 00:02:40,470
Horrible

75
00:02:41,540 --> 00:02:43,270
I don't get it

76
00:02:43,470 --> 00:02:46,180
Apologize!!

77
00:02:45,520 --> 00:02:46,740
That's you

78
00:02:46,990 --> 00:02:48,180
Where's your neck?

79
00:02:48,310 --> 00:02:50,230
I am sorry

80
00:02:51,280 --> 00:02:52,950
Matsumoto-san, why don't we start the show?

81
00:02:52,710 --> 00:02:54,230
Please, set us up

82
00:02:54,230 --> 00:02:56,730
Look towards camera No.4!!

83
00:02:56,730 --> 00:02:58,200
That one!!

84
00:02:59,620 --> 00:03:01,660
You were all over the place

85
00:03:02,300 --> 00:03:06,430
Starting Day

86
00:03:07,970 --> 00:03:09,520
The morning begins with rain

87
00:03:08,250 --> 00:03:13,840
The morning of filming

88
00:03:10,620 --> 00:03:13,870
almost as if to spite the cast

89
00:03:14,540 --> 00:03:18,490
...And you ended up with the most slaps out of all of us

90
00:03:18,490 --> 00:03:21,610
I don't understand anything you're saying

91
00:03:21,610 --> 00:03:26,520
Despite the lousy weather, they are in their usual good spirits

92
00:03:27,980 --> 00:03:29,760
I'm feeling that familiar vibe

93
00:03:30,450 --> 00:03:34,630
Man, I wish Shoji-san would show up and be done with it

94
00:03:31,650 --> 00:03:36,330
Shoji Murakami

95
00:03:34,630 --> 00:03:36,260
He can do his "Ninja School" skit for 30 minutes

96
00:03:39,530 --> 00:03:41,020
There it is again

97
00:03:41,020 --> 00:03:42,670
It says "Wait here"

98
00:03:42,950 --> 00:03:44,820
The initial setup hasn't changed

99
00:03:46,640 --> 00:03:48,810
How cold is it right now?

100
00:03:48,810 --> 00:03:50,710
I'd say it's 0 degrees

101
00:03:51,140 --> 00:03:52,690
I'd say it's below 10 degrees

102
00:03:53,410 --> 00:03:54,410
Bump

103
00:03:54,030 --> 00:03:55,660
It is really cold

104
00:03:55,660 --> 00:03:57,090
What?

105
00:04:00,620 --> 00:04:02,490
Why move like that?

106
00:04:03,200 --> 00:04:04,740
I can see your underwear

107
00:04:07,120 --> 00:04:08,360
Look, he can't get out of it

108
00:04:10,040 --> 00:04:11,670
AH!!

109
00:04:11,830 --> 00:04:14,900
That's one funny looking face

110
00:04:15,210 --> 00:04:17,440
You manage to make it look funnier every year

111
00:04:17,440 --> 00:04:18,710
You've done it again this year

112
00:04:19,940 --> 00:04:23,710
Former Downtown Manager

113
00:04:20,260 --> 00:04:23,710
Hiroshi Fujiwara

114
00:04:24,140 --> 00:04:26,380
Right when you came out and said,"AH!"

115
00:04:26,380 --> 00:04:28,810
I heard the crow cry out

116
00:04:28,810 --> 00:04:29,760
Am I right?

117
00:04:30,180 --> 00:04:30,980
Yes, it did

118
00:04:31,110 --> 00:04:34,150
You had no idea where I was, huh?

119
00:04:35,020 --> 00:04:36,590
Could you guys line up here?

120
00:04:36,590 --> 00:04:38,890
Lined up already

121
00:04:36,790 --> 00:04:38,890
We're already in line

122
00:04:37,010 --> 00:04:38,890
We're lined up

123
00:04:37,450 --> 00:04:38,890
Of course, we are

124
00:04:37,890 --> 00:04:38,890
We're lined up

125
00:04:38,890 --> 00:04:41,430
You still don't know how to improvise

126
00:04:42,100 --> 00:04:43,360
You didn't see we were already lined up?

127
00:04:43,360 --> 00:04:48,460
Didn't the script say "Unless they're already lined up"??
with an asterisk *??

128
00:04:48,770 --> 00:04:50,830
This year, you're going to be spies

129
00:04:51,970 --> 00:04:55,510
"Being a Spy" doesn't quite ring a bell

130
00:04:54,150 --> 00:04:54,970
No, it doesn't

131
00:04:55,510 --> 00:04:57,840
As a newly hired spy, you will...

132
00:04:57,870 --> 00:05:00,610
you will be going through some rigorous training

133
00:04:59,840 --> 00:05:00,700
Kaw

134
00:05:00,700 --> 00:05:01,370
Kaw

135
00:05:01,370 --> 00:05:02,170
Kaw

136
00:05:02,290 --> 00:05:04,400
Could you please string your sentences together?

137
00:05:03,580 --> 00:05:07,820
Yeah, the crow's got you beat

138
00:05:09,060 --> 00:05:17,530
About to take on 24-hours of training!!

139
00:05:09,060 --> 00:05:17,530
Five Newly Hired Spies

140
00:05:17,870 --> 00:05:19,500
And what are you supposed to be?

141
00:05:19,500 --> 00:05:21,230
I'm a hot spy

142
00:05:21,230 --> 00:05:25,270
Look at him laughing at himself

143
00:05:26,520 --> 00:05:28,240
That's hilarious

144
00:05:28,240 --> 00:05:29,870
Yamasaki!

145
00:05:29,870 --> 00:05:32,810
What do spy...

146
00:05:32,850 --> 00:05:34,730
What do spies and traffic rules have in common?

147
00:05:34,750 --> 00:05:35,630
I'd like an answer

148
00:05:38,140 --> 00:05:40,040
He would like an answer

149
00:05:40,080 --> 00:05:42,520
Why don't you just look it up?

150
00:05:43,750 --> 00:05:45,480
You give me an answer

151
00:05:43,800 --> 00:06:05,680
Question

152
00:05:43,800 --> 00:06:05,680
What do Spies and Traffic rules have in common?

153
00:05:45,260 --> 00:05:49,230
What do Spice and...?

154
00:05:47,080 --> 00:05:48,350
Why Spice?

155
00:05:49,510 --> 00:05:51,830
Who the hell is becoming a Spice today?

156
00:05:52,100 --> 00:05:54,850
OK, so what do those two things share?

157
00:05:55,670 --> 00:05:58,940
Well, they're both hot

158
00:05:58,940 --> 00:05:59,970
as in Spice..

159
00:05:59,400 --> 00:06:01,810
We told you we're "Spies"!!

160
00:06:02,670 --> 00:06:04,040
You're a Spy

161
00:06:04,040 --> 00:06:05,680
That's our theme this year

162
00:06:06,110 --> 00:06:07,280
Never mind then

163
00:06:07,280 --> 00:06:08,950
That's it??

164
00:06:08,950 --> 00:06:11,280
And your clothes--how dare you wear that when you're spies!?

165
00:06:12,180 --> 00:06:14,020
I have your uniforms over there

166
00:06:14,650 --> 00:06:16,290
Let's have you get changed

167
00:06:16,450 --> 00:06:21,360
Change Into a Proper Uniform

168
00:06:16,450 --> 00:06:21,360
Prior to spy training

169
00:06:21,360 --> 00:06:24,560
Why do we have to change outside?

170
00:06:24,930 --> 00:06:26,340
How's it going?

171
00:06:26,580 --> 00:06:28,160
You ready to come out?

172
00:06:28,630 --> 00:06:30,300
Come out when I call your name

173
00:06:30,300 --> 00:06:31,440
Hamada!

174
00:06:34,100 --> 00:06:35,560
Not bad

175
00:06:36,410 --> 00:06:41,040
Excellent Fat-Lipped Spy

176
00:06:39,170 --> 00:06:40,770
You're just like James Bond

177
00:06:41,450 --> 00:06:43,850
That's nice of you to say,
thanks

178
00:06:43,850 --> 00:06:45,020
Matsumoto!

179
00:06:49,690 --> 00:06:56,330
Shrewd Pops Spy

180
00:06:52,440 --> 00:06:55,440
007 has got nothing on you

181
00:06:54,790 --> 00:06:56,530
I'm better than that guy?

182
00:06:56,530 --> 00:06:58,430
Of course, I am

183
00:06:58,430 --> 00:06:59,560
Endou!

184
00:07:04,820 --> 00:07:07,920
You've got the "Mission:Impossible" thing going there

185
00:07:04,900 --> 00:07:08,570
Handsome Divorced Spy

186
00:07:09,350 --> 00:07:10,140
Thank you very much

187
00:07:10,140 --> 00:07:13,780
He's got an assortment of comments this year

188
00:07:11,740 --> 00:07:13,750
Right, they're all different

189
00:07:13,780 --> 00:07:14,950
Tanaka!

190
00:07:19,350 --> 00:07:22,680
You resemble a foreign actor--like Tom Cruise

191
00:07:20,580 --> 00:07:26,420
Filthy Brainiac Spy

192
00:07:26,660 --> 00:07:27,860
Yamasaki!

193
00:07:32,500 --> 00:07:37,400
Talentless and Wussy Spy

194
00:07:33,990 --> 00:07:37,260
Your pants seem a bit tight on you

195
00:07:37,590 --> 00:07:38,910
Yes, they're a bit tight

196
00:07:38,910 --> 00:07:40,470
They're short, too

197
00:07:39,700 --> 00:07:41,270
They feel a little snug

198
00:07:41,300 --> 00:07:44,370
Go ahead and line up over here

199
00:07:43,940 --> 00:07:48,150
No Comment for Yamasaki

200
00:07:48,650 --> 00:07:52,280
Here are the rules!!

201
00:07:52,470 --> 00:07:53,350
First

202
00:07:55,320 --> 00:08:00,760
1st Rule: You Will Be Trained as Spies for the Next 24 Hours

203
00:08:01,470 --> 00:08:07,830
2nd Rule:      You Are Not to Laugh During the Next 24 Hours

204
00:08:09,330 --> 00:08:14,960
3rd Rule:    If Caught Laughing, You Will Be Punished

205
00:08:10,240 --> 00:08:11,340
That's all

206
00:08:11,460 --> 00:08:12,470
Did you get all that?

207
00:08:12,700 --> 00:08:13,870
Well...

208
00:08:13,870 --> 00:08:15,530
Yes, we got it

209
00:08:15,530 --> 00:08:16,640
I don't get it

210
00:08:16,640 --> 00:08:18,880
And I don't wanna do it!!

211
00:08:18,910 --> 00:08:20,030
There he goes again

212
00:08:19,940 --> 00:08:22,450
First!

213
00:08:22,450 --> 00:08:25,120
You're not to laugh under any circumstance

214
00:08:25,420 --> 00:08:28,150
You need some serious help with your improv skills

215
00:08:29,220 --> 00:08:31,960
You can never veer from the script, can you?

216
00:08:32,010 --> 00:08:32,830
Well then...

217
00:08:33,250 --> 00:08:35,130
Follow me to the bus stop

218
00:08:35,210 --> 00:08:36,360
Shall we?

219
00:08:36,360 --> 00:08:38,630
Here we go with the bus again

220
00:08:38,630 --> 00:08:41,430
We're riding a bus again?

221
00:08:41,890 --> 00:08:43,190
Let's go

222
00:08:42,670 --> 00:08:45,340
Why are we going by bus?

223
00:08:44,750 --> 00:08:46,420
I wanted James Bond's car

224
00:08:45,790 --> 00:08:48,400
It's gonna be a long ride

225
00:08:48,400 --> 00:08:49,770
Why bus?

226
00:08:49,770 --> 00:08:50,900
Follow me across the street

227
00:08:50,900 --> 00:08:53,370
He's like, "Follow me across the street"

228
00:08:56,730 --> 00:08:58,470
Man, this is gonna be a long day

229
00:08:58,470 --> 00:09:00,410
Here comes the bus!

230
00:08:59,980 --> 00:09:01,020
Here it comes

231
00:09:01,180 --> 00:09:02,370
Here it is

232
00:09:02,590 --> 00:09:07,620
How come spies have to ride the bus?

233
00:09:07,650 --> 00:09:09,120
I demand an explanation

234
00:09:08,890 --> 00:09:09,960
Indeed

235
00:09:09,960 --> 00:09:12,960
Couldn't you have chartered something cooler than this?

236
00:09:13,270 --> 00:09:14,940
Did the bus need to be this flashy?

237
00:09:14,940 --> 00:09:16,820
Come take a look, guys

238
00:09:17,590 --> 00:09:22,600
Check it out
This bus goes to the Gasu Kurobikari Intelligence Agency

239
00:09:23,260 --> 00:09:27,490
Or G.I.A. for short

240
00:09:34,930 --> 00:09:38,720
Black Falcon

241
00:09:35,540 --> 00:09:39,020
The black falcon emblem is all over the bus

242
00:09:39,320 --> 00:09:42,960
Specifically Designed for Spies

243
00:09:39,590 --> 00:09:40,960
I didn't know about that

244
00:09:40,960 --> 00:09:43,100
It's not like we looked at the back of the bus

245
00:09:43,060 --> 00:09:46,760
Hamada, pretty cool, isn't it?

246
00:09:47,100 --> 00:09:50,350
This bus makes no secrets

247
00:09:50,400 --> 00:09:51,560
Right, not very secretive at all

248
00:09:51,030 --> 00:09:52,850
The name of the city is no secret either

249
00:09:52,850 --> 00:09:55,940
Sodegaura

250
00:09:55,940 --> 00:09:57,370
Pretty cool, huh?

251
00:09:57,370 --> 00:09:59,310
Well, I guess it's pretty cool

252
00:09:59,640 --> 00:10:02,610
It must be cool if Hamada says so

253
00:10:02,610 --> 00:10:04,180
Shall we get on then?

254
00:10:05,280 --> 00:10:07,460
The game starts once you board the bus

255
00:10:07,950 --> 00:10:09,290
The moment has finally arrived!

256
00:10:09,470 --> 00:10:10,860
We're in this for 24 hours

257
00:10:12,160 --> 00:10:15,720
No-Laughing for 24 Hours as Spies

258
00:10:12,160 --> 00:10:15,720
START

259
00:10:18,150 --> 00:10:21,090
Are they REALLY agents or other laugh traps...

260
00:10:18,360 --> 00:10:23,440
Other G.I.A. Agents Already on Board

261
00:10:21,090 --> 00:10:23,090
I thought the same thing...

262
00:10:24,110 --> 00:10:26,450
They've kind of got me worried...

263
00:10:26,670 --> 00:10:28,470
Having to face the door is really annoying

264
00:10:28,470 --> 00:10:30,070
I hate being right in front of it

265
00:10:34,080 --> 00:10:36,410
Actually, I say Hamada has laughed already

266
00:10:36,450 --> 00:10:37,610
Yeah, he laughed

267
00:10:38,120 --> 00:10:40,480
You were smiling, right!?

268
00:10:40,480 --> 00:10:42,690
The game has started

269
00:10:41,400 --> 00:10:42,490
Well, because we're starting and all...

270
00:10:42,690 --> 00:10:44,680
This year they're going to be cracking down

271
00:10:44,740 --> 00:10:46,680
on people for things like "Smiling"

272
00:10:47,560 --> 00:10:49,690
Even that's a "Smile"

273
00:10:49,140 --> 00:10:51,090
This isn't a smile, is it?

274
00:10:51,130 --> 00:10:54,330
And Endo is looking over here "smiling", too

275
00:10:54,330 --> 00:10:58,000
Speaking of which, even I'M "smiling" now

276
00:10:56,070 --> 00:10:58,000
Well, that isn't good either

277
00:11:03,230 --> 00:11:04,660
That was good!

278
00:11:05,210 --> 00:11:07,380
You are really dirty!!

279
00:11:05,810 --> 00:11:07,420
Great way to start off

280
00:11:07,440 --> 00:11:08,130
He's Here,

281
00:11:07,800 --> 00:11:08,130
He's Here,

282
00:11:08,130 --> 00:11:08,410
He's Here, He's Here,

283
00:11:08,130 --> 00:11:08,410
He's Here, He's Here,

284
00:11:08,410 --> 00:11:09,360
He's Here, He's Here, He's Here!

285
00:11:08,410 --> 00:11:09,360
He's Here, He's Here, He's Here!

286
00:11:09,410 --> 00:11:10,930
Scary!

287
00:11:12,400 --> 00:11:14,400
You set me up

288
00:11:16,620 --> 00:11:23,160
4th Rule: Receive Your Spanking from the Black Army Corp.

289
00:11:16,910 --> 00:11:18,860
We're screwed! That's freaking scary!

290
00:11:19,050 --> 00:11:20,150
Could you cut that out?

291
00:11:20,230 --> 00:11:22,610
And could you hit more gently?!

292
00:11:22,610 --> 00:11:23,720
This is bad!

293
00:11:24,160 --> 00:11:26,830
A bug would have died from that hit

294
00:11:25,730 --> 00:11:26,850
Hehe...

295
00:11:30,420 --> 00:11:32,140
You better cut that out

296
00:11:33,440 --> 00:11:35,290
I don't see me laughing at this point

297
00:11:35,310 --> 00:11:39,440
Comrades Suddenly Gang Up on Each Other

298
00:11:37,800 --> 00:11:39,480
Would you give it a rest!?

299
00:11:40,150 --> 00:11:41,550
This was epic!

300
00:11:41,490 --> 00:11:42,890
This is bad!

301
00:11:42,890 --> 00:11:44,890
Ooh! That must've hurt!

302
00:11:45,750 --> 00:11:48,790
Seriously, enough of the silly comparisons

303
00:11:48,860 --> 00:11:53,220
What I say is always serious--everyone just interprets it wrong...

304
00:11:53,260 --> 00:11:55,660
Hey, my fly is open!

305
00:11:55,660 --> 00:11:57,420
You laughed out hard!

306
00:11:56,960 --> 00:11:59,260
This hasn't gotten us anywhere at all!

307
00:11:58,690 --> 00:12:00,380
I didn't do that on purpose!

308
00:12:02,420 --> 00:12:04,060
Not my fault

309
00:12:03,730 --> 00:12:05,970
This guy's been laughing too!

310
00:12:14,440 --> 00:12:16,180
Let's get going!

311
00:12:16,180 --> 00:12:18,480
Depart, please!!

312
00:12:18,920 --> 00:12:28,490
New Spies Bound for GIA Headquarters by Bus!!

313
00:12:25,820 --> 00:12:29,040
What kind of day is ahead of them?

314
00:12:29,660 --> 00:12:32,260
Fujiwara's face is just...

315
00:12:32,600 --> 00:12:35,100
Just don't even go there...

316
00:12:35,100 --> 00:12:37,360
You're free to look at him on your own time, but...

317
00:12:37,360 --> 00:12:39,990
it'd be better if you didn't try to get me to laugh

318
00:12:40,300 --> 00:12:45,780
Laughter Being Completely Unforgivable

319
00:12:40,510 --> 00:12:45,460
Tension Builds as They Try to Suppress It

320
00:12:44,070 --> 00:12:46,580
Yama-chan, you were smirking

321
00:12:50,710 --> 00:12:52,480
Pu fu fu fu

322
00:12:51,720 --> 00:12:54,750
Pu Ha ha ha hah...

323
00:12:59,100 --> 00:13:08,880
Kintarou: Strong, Bold child from Japanese Folklore (more info at shibatabread.com)

324
00:12:59,120 --> 00:13:08,880
Kintarou Crosses the Street

325
00:13:11,900 --> 00:13:15,240
The timing of his appearance was horrible...

326
00:13:18,260 --> 00:13:19,600
His size is what got me

327
00:13:19,440 --> 00:13:20,680
Who is that?

328
00:13:20,680 --> 00:13:22,580
First time seeing him!!

329
00:13:25,880 --> 00:13:27,850
Who?

330
00:13:28,290 --> 00:13:29,520
Really puny, isn't he!!

331
00:13:29,520 --> 00:13:32,290
He's so slow

332
00:13:33,350 --> 00:13:36,030
I thought it was the Grandma, but I guess I was wrong

333
00:13:33,360 --> 00:13:38,460
Aforementioned Grandma

334
00:13:36,030 --> 00:13:38,460
That's definitely not the Grandma I know...

335
00:13:41,870 --> 00:13:44,400
I can't tell unless I see his face

336
00:13:44,500 --> 00:13:47,200
We couldn't figure out who he was

337
00:13:50,570 --> 00:13:55,850
It's the broa~d axe bea~ring Kintaro~u!

338
00:13:56,250 --> 00:13:58,580
Who?

339
00:13:58,580 --> 00:13:59,850
Really puny, isn't he!!

340
00:14:04,290 --> 00:14:06,790
I can't tell unless I see his face

341
00:14:07,020 --> 00:14:09,420
We couldn't figure out who he was

342
00:14:13,060 --> 00:14:18,800
It's the broa~d axe bea~ring Kintaro~u!

343
00:14:18,030 --> 00:14:21,540
It's Meira-san!!

344
00:14:25,040 --> 00:14:28,880
Kintarou

345
00:14:25,040 --> 00:14:28,880
Meira Yoshikazu

346
00:14:31,180 --> 00:14:33,050
Argh~!!!!!

347
00:14:33,050 --> 00:14:34,880
He's got such a great voice!

348
00:14:38,140 --> 00:14:41,410
Man, I'm getting enough spankings

349
00:14:44,850 --> 00:14:47,390
This is unbelievably painful

350
00:14:48,830 --> 00:14:51,500
He sure can sing

351
00:14:51,500 --> 00:14:53,010
His voice is top notch

352
00:14:53,540 --> 00:14:55,170
Wait, the bear..

353
00:14:55,170 --> 00:14:56,370
Um, the bear is moving on its own...

354
00:14:56,370 --> 00:14:58,740
The bear is still going!

355
00:15:02,340 --> 00:15:05,080
You better go stop the bear...

356
00:15:06,100 --> 00:15:08,130
Who wouldn't laugh at that?!!

357
00:15:08,130 --> 00:15:09,550
Don't look, don't look at the bear

358
00:15:09,550 --> 00:15:12,020
Just that bear moving can get us OUT

359
00:15:13,920 --> 00:15:16,760
Dangit, Yamasaki!

360
00:15:16,760 --> 00:15:18,790
You don't need to say things like that!!

361
00:15:25,970 --> 00:15:27,600
I'm a strong boy!

362
00:15:30,710 --> 00:15:32,240
See for yourself!

363
00:15:46,550 --> 00:15:51,060
"Kappa" Boards the Bus

364
00:15:46,560 --> 00:15:51,250
Kappa: mischievous water creatures good at sumo wrestling (more info at shibatabread.com)

365
00:15:54,260 --> 00:15:56,530
Get a hold of yourselves!

366
00:15:56,530 --> 00:15:59,070
Yeah, let's face these pranks one at a time!

367
00:15:59,070 --> 00:16:01,040
And the bear is still roaming around...

368
00:16:01,700 --> 00:16:02,400
That bear is dangerous! So very dangerous!!

369
00:16:02,400 --> 00:16:03,430
That bear is dangerous! So very dangerous!!

370
00:16:03,430 --> 00:16:04,940
The bear could get hit by a car

371
00:16:04,940 --> 00:16:06,880
First off, let's stop the bear

372
00:16:12,050 --> 00:16:13,650
Hey!! Kappa-kun

373
00:16:13,650 --> 00:16:16,020
You shouldn't come out into the human world!

374
00:16:18,950 --> 00:16:20,140
Since it's come to this...

375
00:16:20,190 --> 00:16:22,790
if you lose a sumo match to me

376
00:16:22,790 --> 00:16:24,330
you have to return to the river!!

377
00:16:25,630 --> 00:16:32,130
Kintarou vs. Kappa Showdown

378
00:16:26,870 --> 00:16:28,990
Why on a bus?

379
00:16:32,930 --> 00:16:34,370
Ready!Go!

380
00:16:34,370 --> 00:16:35,500
Ready! Go!

381
00:16:35,870 --> 00:16:40,110
Keep Going! Keep Going!...

382
00:16:48,520 --> 00:16:50,700
I just saw something I didn't need to see

383
00:16:51,430 --> 00:16:53,110
That's just too funny...

384
00:17:00,430 --> 00:17:02,430
I was spared

385
00:17:04,500 --> 00:17:05,570
You were called OUT right!?

386
00:17:08,070 --> 00:17:10,240
Return home safely!

387
00:17:13,070 --> 00:17:14,610
See ya!

388
00:17:14,710 --> 00:17:20,250
It's the broa~d axe bea~ring Kintaro~u!

389
00:17:20,200 --> 00:17:25,570
Folkloric commands used by horsemen to control horses.
Comparable to "Mush!" in English

390
00:17:20,250 --> 00:17:26,150
Hai shi doudou! Hai doudou!

391
00:17:27,460 --> 00:17:30,530
He's got an amazing voice!

392
00:17:34,560 --> 00:17:36,030
Ah, he's over there!

393
00:17:37,200 --> 00:17:39,600
Hai shi doudou! Hai doudou!

394
00:17:42,110 --> 00:17:45,400
Couldn't they present the pranks one by one!?

395
00:17:42,830 --> 00:17:47,340
20 Minutes from Commencement

396
00:17:47,380 --> 00:17:51,480
Argh, there's more people out there

397
00:17:49,840 --> 00:17:51,480
You don't need to tell me that

398
00:17:52,580 --> 00:17:55,520
Stops at Bus Stop

399
00:17:56,550 --> 00:18:03,690
Meikun High School Baseball Team

400
00:18:07,300 --> 00:18:09,600
Boy, today's practice was tiring!

401
00:18:09,090 --> 00:18:13,450
Iwaki

402
00:18:09,090 --> 00:18:13,450

405
00:18:09,710 --> 00:18:11,730
Don't be like that--just focus on the good times

406
00:18:10,500 --> 00:18:15,740
Even though they already laughed, please enjoy this skit without interruption

407
00:18:11,760 --> 00:18:15,740
and we'll give our all together!

408
00:18:17,240 --> 00:18:18,810
What's the matter, Satonaka?

409
00:18:18,810 --> 00:18:20,310
I...

410
00:18:20,310 --> 00:18:23,080
I was thinking about quitting the team

411
00:18:23,080 --> 00:18:25,880
What are you talking about?

412
00:18:25,880 --> 00:18:27,050
Satonaka, you are Meikun's

413
00:18:27,050 --> 00:18:29,620
Satonaka, you are Meikun's

414
00:18:29,620 --> 00:18:31,590
Ace pitcher!

415
00:18:31,590 --> 00:18:33,720
It's more fun hanging out with my friends though...

416
00:18:33,720 --> 00:18:35,520
Leave me be, I'm going!!

417
00:18:35,800 --> 00:18:36,970
Hey, Hey, Hey!

418
00:18:36,490 --> 00:18:41,360

419
00:18:36,970 --> 00:18:37,870
Satonaka!

420
00:18:37,870 --> 00:18:39,100
Aren't you worried we might lose...?

421
00:18:38,820 --> 00:18:39,490
You fool!

422
00:18:39,490 --> 00:18:40,720
You idiot!! What--

423
00:18:40,720 --> 00:18:41,720
What's gotten into him!?

424
00:18:41,720 --> 00:18:44,220
What are we going to do!? He was our ace player!!

425
00:18:43,870 --> 00:18:45,100
Ah!!

426
00:18:46,100 --> 00:18:48,240
Yamada!!

427
00:18:48,240 --> 00:18:50,050
That slope outside could easily send you flying!

428
00:18:50,140 --> 00:18:56,840
Dokaben Deluxe!

429
00:18:53,230 --> 00:18:55,300
Satonaka quit the team!

430
00:18:55,360 --> 00:18:56,640
Did you see him!?

431
00:18:56,640 --> 00:18:58,640
He's too huge!!

432
00:19:01,450 --> 00:19:02,680
Ah!

433
00:19:03,550 --> 00:19:05,690
Yamada!!

434
00:19:05,870 --> 00:19:07,710
That slope outside could easily send you flying!!

435
00:19:07,710 --> 00:19:14,400
Dokaben Deluxe!

436
00:19:10,670 --> 00:19:12,850
Satonaka quit the team!

437
00:19:12,910 --> 00:19:14,250
Did you see him!?

438
00:19:15,260 --> 00:19:16,650
He's too huge!

439
00:19:17,900 --> 00:19:20,530
Dokaben

440
00:19:17,900 --> 00:19:20,530
Matsuko Deluxe

441
00:19:20,530 --> 00:19:23,580
We need to find a replacement for Satonaka!

442
00:19:23,580 --> 00:19:26,600
We won't be able to find one that easily though!!

443
00:19:26,600 --> 00:19:28,050
We can't say for sure...

444
00:19:28,110 --> 00:19:29,500
Yes?

445
00:19:30,340 --> 00:19:31,580
He's here!!

446
00:19:31,580 --> 00:19:34,480
I see a good replacement!!

447
00:19:39,950 --> 00:19:45,760
Targets Endou ?

448
00:19:46,360 --> 00:19:48,060
Could you stand up?

449
00:19:48,060 --> 00:19:49,060
Stand up

450
00:19:56,400 --> 00:19:59,620
You've definitely had experience with baseball, right?

451
00:20:00,370 --> 00:20:03,140
You've DEFINITELY had experience with baseball, RIGHT!?

452
00:20:02,410 --> 00:20:03,080
Yeah...

453
00:20:05,550 --> 00:20:07,110
Let's play baseball together?

454
00:20:07,500 --> 00:20:09,230
Right now that's a bit unreasonable...

455
00:20:09,230 --> 00:20:11,450
And I'm asking you why?!!

456
00:20:11,410 --> 00:20:12,360
I'm doing something else right now...

457
00:20:12,150 --> 00:20:13,650
What exactly are you doing?!

458
00:20:18,230 --> 00:20:19,860
What do you have to do!!

459
00:20:28,540 --> 00:20:30,470
Not much you could have done, Endou

460
00:20:34,880 --> 00:20:36,980
It's your fault, Endou

461
00:20:38,450 --> 00:20:40,110
What?  My butt too?

462
00:20:45,750 --> 00:20:46,820
Ah!!

463
00:20:46,820 --> 00:20:48,090
It's them...

464
00:20:50,930 --> 00:20:55,160
The Gang Starts Shooting

465
00:20:55,160 --> 00:20:56,930
It's Satonaka!!

466
00:20:57,330 --> 00:20:58,200
It's Satonaka!!

467
00:20:58,200 --> 00:21:00,330
Satonaka

468
00:21:01,470 --> 00:21:04,810
If that's him, we have to kill them!!

469
00:21:05,140 --> 00:21:07,010
They're shooting us!!

470
00:21:10,410 --> 00:21:11,410
Hey, where did they go?

471
00:21:12,780 --> 00:21:14,150
Hurry, kill them!!

472
00:21:15,720 --> 00:21:19,490
Shooting Starts

473
00:21:23,290 --> 00:21:25,930
Satonaka

474
00:21:26,790 --> 00:21:28,660
(Satonaka) is such a degenerate!!

475
00:21:28,660 --> 00:21:31,490
Yamada, we have to do something!

476
00:21:31,550 --> 00:21:32,140
OK

477
00:21:32,530 --> 00:21:35,640
I'll be the decoy...

478
00:21:35,970 --> 00:21:38,270
when they're distracted, take care of Satonaka!!

479
00:21:39,670 --> 00:21:41,480
BANG

480
00:21:43,180 --> 00:21:44,680
BANG

481
00:21:45,750 --> 00:21:53,050
Tonouma Injured

482
00:21:47,220 --> 00:21:49,520
I'd say that's more than an injury

483
00:21:50,460 --> 00:21:51,690
He's dead

484
00:21:53,990 --> 00:21:55,860
Tonma!

485
00:21:55,860 --> 00:21:56,920
Come back!!

486
00:21:57,090 --> 00:21:59,190
Tonma!  Come back!!

487
00:22:00,330 --> 00:22:01,660
Bastard!

488
00:22:02,260 --> 00:22:05,900
Satonaka runs away

489
00:22:03,630 --> 00:22:05,600
He's so bad

490
00:22:07,030 --> 00:22:08,040
I'm gonna do it!!

491
00:22:08,040 --> 00:22:11,970
Bazooka Ready

492
00:22:25,350 --> 00:22:30,760
Satonaka Blown Away

493
00:22:27,590 --> 00:22:28,620
Take that!

494
00:22:29,290 --> 00:22:30,690
Satonaka, you bastard!

495
00:22:31,560 --> 00:22:34,150
But he used to be his teammate, right?

496
00:22:35,660 --> 00:22:37,060
Let's go, Tonouma!!

497
00:22:40,500 --> 00:22:42,100
Your nose fell off, Tonouma!!

498
00:22:43,600 --> 00:22:46,740
This is messed up!!

499
00:22:48,510 --> 00:22:50,280
This is messed up!

500
00:22:56,180 --> 00:22:57,950
This is crazy

501
00:23:07,460 --> 00:23:09,660
The slap to my face was painful

502
00:23:09,660 --> 00:23:10,900
I'm sorry

503
00:23:15,240 --> 00:23:16,640
I'm sorry

504
00:23:16,640 --> 00:23:18,040
I'm sorry

505
00:23:18,040 --> 00:23:20,210
There's no reason to apologize to me

506
00:23:19,270 --> 00:23:20,210
Dokaben-san

507
00:23:20,340 --> 00:23:22,510
Why is he apologizing?

508
00:23:23,480 --> 00:23:25,010
I'm sorry

509
00:23:25,010 --> 00:23:27,080
Dokaben-san, no need to apologize

510
00:23:27,820 --> 00:23:29,820
I'm sorry!!

511
00:23:29,980 --> 00:23:31,520
That was scary!

512
00:23:32,720 --> 00:23:34,390
Geez, what was that all about

513
00:23:36,120 --> 00:23:37,490
I'm sorry!

514
00:23:38,460 --> 00:23:40,860
He's still apologizing

515
00:23:41,960 --> 00:23:44,770
That was messed up

516
00:23:44,700 --> 00:23:48,040
30 Minutes Into the Game

517
00:23:45,500 --> 00:23:48,070
Only 30 minutes have passed

518
00:23:48,270 --> 00:23:52,140
Already Receiving Punishment!!

519
00:23:48,500 --> 00:23:51,400
The members have already received a lot of punishment

520
00:23:51,970 --> 00:23:54,140
Arrival at the GIA main office

521
00:23:52,910 --> 00:23:59,410
The Long Route to the GIA Main Office...

522
00:23:54,880 --> 00:23:57,430
won't be any time soon

523
00:24:01,000 --> 00:24:03,030
This is a long ride!!

524
00:24:03,030 --> 00:24:06,940
To be safe, we should avoid looking ahead...

525
00:24:04,670 --> 00:24:06,940
Yes, that's true

526
00:24:05,300 --> 00:24:06,940
Yes, that's true

527
00:24:12,710 --> 00:24:14,980
Arrival at a Bus Stop

528
00:24:17,250 --> 00:24:24,220

This is the big time, everyone
-Yes

531
00:24:30,890 --> 00:24:33,300
Did you practice enough?

532
00:24:33,820 --> 00:24:36,650
Maybe do a dry run...

533
00:24:34,160 --> 00:24:36,970

534
00:24:34,160 --> 00:24:36,970

I'm from an office promoting impersonators

536
00:24:37,930 --> 00:24:40,470
I'm from an office promoting impersonators

537
00:24:41,170 --> 00:24:45,470
Would it be possible to show you some of our impersonations?

538
00:24:46,340 --> 00:24:48,480
It doesn't matter, go for it...

539
00:24:48,940 --> 00:24:49,610
Here is..

540
00:24:50,350 --> 00:24:53,750

544
00:25:04,360 --> 00:25:07,700
As a beautiful woman in a swimsuit passes by Eddie Murphy!

545
00:25:06,630 --> 00:25:22,510
As a beautiful woman in a swimsuit passes by Eddie Murphy

546
00:25:06,630 --> 00:25:22,510
From Beverly Hills Cop 2

547
00:25:09,460 --> 00:25:11,900
This is great! A cute girl!

548
00:25:17,010 --> 00:25:19,840
Hey, my son!  This is your chance!

549
00:25:22,840 --> 00:25:23,080

550
00:25:23,080 --> 00:25:23,250

551
00:25:23,250 --> 00:25:24,780
Gyo Gyo Gyo!!

552
00:25:25,380 --> 00:25:27,920
Don't interrupt the other comics

553
00:25:27,920 --> 00:25:29,790
Let him do his act

554
00:25:33,950 --> 00:25:37,090
I'm doing Megumi Yasu saying "Eh" too many times

555

[Eh] Yasumegumi (Using "Eh" a lot)

557
00:25:37,090 --> 00:25:42,900
I'm told that I resemble Obake no Kyutaro because I'm dishonest

558
00:25:42,900 --> 00:25:49,810
but that's not true--I'm usually always like this

559
00:25:49,810 --> 00:25:50,810
Eh!

560
00:25:50,810 --> 00:25:54,710
People always misunderstand me

561
00:25:54,710 --> 00:25:56,010
Eh!

562
00:25:56,180 --> 00:25:57,850
Please believe me!

563
00:25:57,850 --> 00:25:58,480
Eh!

564
00:25:59,180 --> 00:26:00,680
Eh! Eh!

565
00:26:00,820 --> 00:26:02,850
EH!

566
00:26:03,290 --> 00:26:05,520
Gyo Gyo Gyo!

567
00:26:04,430 --> 00:26:05,490
I said be quiet!

568
00:26:05,990 --> 00:26:07,520
Let her do her thing

569
00:26:08,720 --> 00:26:10,660
That was good, that was good

570
00:26:11,560 --> 00:26:12,430
OK, next

571
00:26:12,530 --> 00:26:15,400
Kajiki Maguro-kun

572
00:26:15,400 --> 00:26:20,440
Kajiki Maguro kun will now imitate a rebellious Kajiki Maguro

573
00:26:20,700 --> 00:27:06,250
Rebellious Kajiki Maguro (swordfish)

574
00:26:33,580 --> 00:26:35,700
Hey, old hag!

575
00:26:35,720 --> 00:26:38,860
Why did you turn off the A/C?

576
00:26:41,890 --> 00:26:42,720
Money, give me money

577
00:26:43,330 --> 00:26:44,890
Hey, Hiroki

578
00:26:44,960 --> 00:26:48,190
I stole 5000 yen from my mom

579
00:26:48,240 --> 00:26:50,360
Let's go eat some food!

580
00:26:51,070 --> 00:26:52,630
Vvrroomm!!

581
00:26:52,630 --> 00:26:55,200
Ween ween ween ween ween!!

582
00:26:55,700 --> 00:26:56,640
Let's go!

583
00:27:05,180 --> 00:27:06,780
Hey, hey, that's enough

584
00:27:07,050 --> 00:27:09,480
You're not consistent!!

585
00:27:16,510 --> 00:27:17,990
Get it right

586
00:27:18,560 --> 00:27:20,930
He's not consistent

587
00:27:30,110 --> 00:27:33,410
Yes, he wasn't consistent

588
00:27:33,580 --> 00:27:36,610
You didn't decide on "vvrroom" or "ween"

589
00:27:36,610 --> 00:27:39,650
You can throttle differently to make various noises...

590
00:27:38,180 --> 00:27:39,650
But, there is no "ween"

591
00:27:39,820 --> 00:27:43,850
It wasn't a tight performance

592
00:27:44,150 --> 00:27:44,920
Yeah

593
00:27:45,050 --> 00:27:46,050
Here's your last chance

594
00:27:46,050 --> 00:27:49,020
What? That's enough already

595
00:27:49,460 --> 00:27:52,800
Kajiki Maguro stuck in traffic on the freeway

596
00:27:52,230 --> 00:28:19,750
Kajiki Maguro Stuck in Traffic on the Freeway

597
00:27:52,830 --> 00:27:56,300
He's not performing--he's just talking

598
00:27:59,570 --> 00:28:01,800
Why so much traffic...

599
00:28:04,470 --> 00:28:06,680
And no place to park either

600
00:28:19,790 --> 00:28:23,290
What the hell are you doing?

601
00:28:24,510 --> 00:28:26,200
Don't make those kinds of comments!

602
00:28:30,430 --> 00:28:31,800
I didn't know what he was doing

603
00:28:31,800 --> 00:28:33,600
Yeah, I didn't know what he was doing

604
00:28:33,600 --> 00:28:35,600
Give me a break

605
00:28:38,240 --> 00:28:38,770
Let's go

606
00:28:38,840 --> 00:28:40,840
It's almost show time

607
00:28:44,080 --> 00:28:45,680
Kajiki Maguro's not moving

608
00:28:45,680 --> 00:28:46,770
Excuse us

609
00:28:46,770 --> 00:28:48,330
Excuse us

610
00:28:48,880 --> 00:28:50,620
You're coming too

611
00:28:50,620 --> 00:28:52,650
Gyo Gyo!!

612
00:28:58,530 --> 00:29:00,000
It's not.. you know

613
00:29:00,460 --> 00:29:02,000
It wasn't funny

614
00:29:04,830 --> 00:29:06,590
We couldn't take it anymore

615
00:29:08,100 --> 00:29:09,370
That was very long

616
00:29:09,840 --> 00:29:13,910
50 minutes into the game

617
00:29:10,510 --> 00:29:12,170
It was about 20 minutes

618
00:29:12,170 --> 00:29:13,880
They really tried hard

619
00:29:15,680 --> 00:29:18,010
We're not there yet

620
00:29:18,280 --> 00:29:19,780
We're not there yet?

621
00:29:19,780 --> 00:29:22,520
Just a little bit longer

622
00:29:23,650 --> 00:29:27,360
We didn't do anything "Spy" related

623
00:29:29,360 --> 00:29:34,560
Hamada covers his laugh with a cough

624
00:29:35,430 --> 00:29:38,270
Arrival at a Bus Stop

625
00:29:38,770 --> 00:29:44,740
Two Middle School Students

626
00:29:44,740 --> 00:29:45,270
What?

627
00:29:45,940 --> 00:29:47,010
Wow!

628
00:29:47,010 --> 00:29:48,500
What is that?

629
00:29:51,640 --> 00:29:53,480
Oh, look at that!!

630
00:29:51,640 --> 00:29:53,480
Oh, look at that!!

631
00:29:55,080 --> 00:29:59,890
Excited By Magazine Pin-Up Girls

632
00:29:58,460 --> 00:29:59,690
They're really something else

633
00:30:00,030 --> 00:30:00,560
This is torture

634
00:30:00,890 --> 00:30:01,360
They're really big, huh?

635
00:30:01,360 --> 00:30:01,980
Killer

636
00:30:01,980 --> 00:30:02,700
They're really big, huh?

637
00:30:02,750 --> 00:30:03,520
Killer

638
00:30:03,520 --> 00:30:04,280
They are killer

639
00:30:05,190 --> 00:30:07,440
Stops at Bus Stop

640
00:30:10,920 --> 00:30:11,860
She's asking for it

641
00:30:11,860 --> 00:30:13,530
I can almost see them

642
00:30:13,550 --> 00:30:14,580
Unbelievable

643
00:30:15,000 --> 00:30:21,010
Stripper on Board

644
00:30:24,150 --> 00:30:25,660
So they brought him here

645
00:30:25,350 --> 00:30:28,850
Muga Tsukaji    (Drunk Dragon)

646
00:30:25,350 --> 00:30:28,850
Stripper

647
00:30:39,980 --> 00:30:41,400
This is incredible

648
00:30:41,900 --> 00:30:44,260
Hey there, middle schoolers

649
00:30:44,260 --> 00:30:46,370
I couldn't help but notice you're having some fun

650
00:30:46,900 --> 00:30:49,100
But how about seeing

651
00:30:49,100 --> 00:30:50,770
The real thing...

652
00:30:51,780 --> 00:30:53,830
And this is how you like it?

653
00:30:54,550 --> 00:30:56,050
And this is how you like it?

654
00:30:56,080 --> 00:30:59,950
And you like it like this, like that, like this, and like that?

655
00:30:59,680 --> 00:31:04,250
Working It for the Students

656
00:31:00,140 --> 00:31:02,080
And this is how you like it?

657
00:31:02,080 --> 00:31:03,880
And this is how you like it?

658
00:31:03,880 --> 00:31:07,940
And you like it like this, like that , like this, and like that?

00:31:07,940 --> 00:31:09,800
And this is how you like it?

00:31:09,800 --> 00:31:11,580
And this is how you like it?

661
00:31:11,580 --> 00:31:16,070
And you like it like this, like that, like this, and like that?

662
00:31:17,430 --> 00:31:20,070
He can't even unbutton it!?

663
00:31:21,600 --> 00:31:24,060
He failed to unbutton his shirt

664
00:31:24,390 --> 00:31:25,870
His hands were too cold to unbutton them

665
00:31:31,830 --> 00:31:33,600
And this is how you like it?

666
00:31:33,600 --> 00:31:35,230

And this is how you like it

670
00:31:41,630 --> 00:31:43,860
And you like it like this, and like...

671
00:31:43,020 --> 00:31:43,890
Sis!

672
00:31:44,520 --> 00:31:45,690
Yoshio!

673
00:31:52,250 --> 00:31:54,510
What the hell...?

674
00:31:56,210 --> 00:31:58,340
What's up with this story?

675
00:32:00,700 --> 00:32:01,860
What the hell...?

676
00:32:04,390 --> 00:32:06,980
How awkward is this...?

677
00:32:10,150 --> 00:32:13,450
What are you doing here anyway, sis?

678
00:32:13,450 --> 00:32:15,520
You're humiliating me!

679
00:32:16,990 --> 00:32:19,330
What else can I do then?

680
00:32:19,760 --> 00:32:22,960
Dad doesn't work and mom just left us

681
00:32:23,430 --> 00:32:27,530
Do you think I like doing this?

682
00:32:29,200 --> 00:32:33,070
I'm doing this so that you can attend college!

683
00:32:33,960 --> 00:32:36,810
Tell me you're still humiliated

684
00:32:36,980 --> 00:32:40,680
after you see my dance one last time!

685
00:32:39,530 --> 00:32:40,730
Makes no sense

686
00:32:40,980 --> 00:32:42,470
She's missing the point

687
00:32:41,600 --> 00:32:43,480
Hey, you dirty old men!

688
00:32:43,480 --> 00:32:45,070
Here I go again!

689
00:32:45,070 --> 00:32:46,530
This is how you like it?

690
00:32:46,560 --> 00:32:48,080
And this is how you like it?

691
00:32:48,080 --> 00:32:51,530
And you like it like this, like that, like this, and like that?

692
00:32:51,530 --> 00:32:53,350
This is how you like it?

693
00:32:53,350 --> 00:32:55,040
And this is how you like it?

694
00:32:55,040 --> 00:32:58,870
And you like it like this, like that, like this, and like that?

695
00:32:58,870 --> 00:32:58,870
And this is how you like it?

696
00:33:01,280 --> 00:33:03,150
What a moron!

697
00:33:03,150 --> 00:33:06,410
And you like it like this, like that, like this, and like that?

698
00:33:06,470 --> 00:33:09,510
Lotion Service

699
00:33:09,510 --> 00:33:11,210
This is the sound you like?

700
00:33:11,210 --> 00:33:12,810
And this is the sound you like?

701
00:33:12,810 --> 00:33:14,410
And then...and...

702
00:33:19,550 --> 00:33:24,260
Lotion Causes Major Slipping

703
00:33:25,360 --> 00:33:27,200
You asked for that

704
00:33:30,430 --> 00:33:32,000
That wasn't planned, huh?

705
00:33:32,000 --> 00:33:34,240
Of course, your hands are slippery

706
00:33:35,570 --> 00:33:38,280
I think that hurt him a little bit

707
00:33:38,670 --> 00:33:40,140
Yoshio!

708
00:33:40,140 --> 00:33:41,670
How was my dance?

709
00:33:41,670 --> 00:33:42,990
That was beautiful, sis

710
00:33:42,990 --> 00:33:45,140
You're the best sister anyone could ever have!

711
00:33:45,230 --> 00:33:46,320
Yoshio!

712
00:33:46,480 --> 00:33:49,980
A Heart Warming Ending

713
00:33:50,480 --> 00:33:53,550
I'm fixing your favorite croquette tonight

714
00:33:53,550 --> 00:33:55,460
Sorry my hands are sticky

715
00:33:55,860 --> 00:33:58,830
So was it his sister or his brother?

716
00:34:04,160 --> 00:34:05,720
I suppose she's his sister...

717
00:34:05,720 --> 00:34:07,200
At least that's what she said but...

718
00:34:07,200 --> 00:34:09,100
Look, they're going home happy

719
00:34:09,100 --> 00:34:11,200
Good for them

720
00:34:11,200 --> 00:34:14,440
That's a good sister, or brother?

721
00:34:14,440 --> 00:34:17,110
I suppose she's his sister...

722
00:34:18,040 --> 00:34:25,620
After a Long Ride,

723
00:34:18,040 --> 00:34:25,620
the Bus Nears the GIA!!

724
00:34:27,020 --> 00:34:30,420
We're almost at the GIA

725
00:34:31,920 --> 00:34:33,130
What a long trip!

726
00:34:33,130 --> 00:34:34,260
Yes, that was

727
00:34:34,260 --> 00:34:35,730
A long trip

728
00:34:35,960 --> 00:34:38,800
How come we're riding with the public?

729
00:34:38,800 --> 00:34:40,470
You're right

730
00:34:40,600 --> 00:34:43,710
Here, we have arrived

731
00:34:53,560 --> 00:35:01,900
A Spying and Laughing Training Facility
Where the Cast Will Face a 24 Hour Challenge!

732
00:35:01,900 --> 00:35:05,170
This already doesn't look good

733
00:35:03,410 --> 00:35:04,790
My heart just sunk

734
00:35:05,170 --> 00:35:05,990
What do you mean?

735
00:35:07,250 --> 00:35:10,450
I think I just saw something I shouldn't have

736
00:35:08,590 --> 00:35:09,550
I think I did, too

737
00:35:13,760 --> 00:35:15,410
What are you talking about?

738
00:35:15,730 --> 00:35:17,350
OK we're here

739
00:35:16,570 --> 00:35:19,540
Arrival at GIA

740
00:35:17,620 --> 00:35:20,320
Why don't you follow me?

741
00:35:22,840 --> 00:35:23,970
This way

742
00:35:24,990 --> 00:35:26,670
This is the GIA

743
00:35:26,670 --> 00:35:27,920
Pretty grand, isn't it?

744
00:35:27,920 --> 00:35:31,100
It is quite magnificent

745
00:35:32,740 --> 00:35:34,780
Please line up over here

746
00:35:36,660 --> 00:35:39,470
Line up in front of the statue

747
00:35:39,470 --> 00:35:41,250
Face the statue

748
00:35:43,580 --> 00:35:45,190
Here we have

749
00:35:45,770 --> 00:35:48,630
what is the symbolic statue of GIA

750
00:35:48,630 --> 00:35:50,330
It's the phantom...

751
00:35:50,330 --> 00:35:54,970
GIA Symbol

752
00:35:50,330 --> 00:35:54,970
Gasuu Black Falcon

753
00:35:55,540 --> 00:36:00,050
This is...well...

754
00:36:00,050 --> 00:36:02,550
This is that.....

755
00:36:07,270 --> 00:36:08,490
Seriously...

756
00:36:08,490 --> 00:36:09,650
You do this every year

757
00:36:09,650 --> 00:36:11,620
You never fail to do this to us

758
00:36:16,630 --> 00:36:18,100
What's this thing landing on?

759
00:36:18,330 --> 00:36:23,350
Buttocks

760
00:36:20,420 --> 00:36:21,520
It's on a butt

761
00:36:21,520 --> 00:36:22,910
This black falcon is...

762
00:36:22,910 --> 00:36:24,170
You know...?

763
00:36:25,440 --> 00:36:28,710
This falcon was modeled after a 3rd generation Japanese

764
00:36:28,710 --> 00:36:34,980
named Micky Takano who was alleged to be the first spy ever

765
00:36:34,550 --> 00:36:37,050
I didn't get any of that

766
00:36:39,050 --> 00:36:39,920
And Micky Takano...

767
00:36:43,650 --> 00:36:46,470
Could you not make that kind of comment, please?

768
00:36:47,590 --> 00:36:50,550
Why is the sculpture in the shape of an animal then?

769
00:36:53,430 --> 00:36:55,950
Please keep your comments to yourself

770
00:36:56,240 --> 00:36:57,970
This is modeled after Micky Takano

771
00:36:57,970 --> 00:36:59,280
Impressive, huh?

772
00:37:01,940 --> 00:37:03,520
Watch out, Hamada!!

773
00:37:05,950 --> 00:37:07,510
Watch out, Hamada!!

774
00:37:08,560 --> 00:37:12,970
Sniper Attack

775
00:37:11,480 --> 00:37:12,970
Where is he?

776
00:37:13,820 --> 00:37:14,870
There he is!

777
00:37:19,080 --> 00:37:20,170
Ah!

778
00:37:25,390 --> 00:37:27,400
Close call

779
00:37:27,400 --> 00:37:30,900
Remember, your lives are always at stake

780
00:37:30,900 --> 00:37:34,040
Watch youselves

781
00:37:34,190 --> 00:37:34,640
Let's go then

782
00:37:34,640 --> 00:37:38,380
We should not have hung around here

783
00:37:42,950 --> 00:37:44,900
Line up here

784
00:37:47,670 --> 00:37:49,620
Line up right here

785
00:37:49,620 --> 00:37:51,580
As you enter this building,

786
00:37:51,580 --> 00:37:55,160
you will be subject to a full body scan

787
00:37:54,190 --> 00:38:04,170
Full Body Scan Required to Prevent Bio-terrorist Attacks

788
00:37:54,190 --> 00:38:04,170
Security Check

789
00:37:55,190 --> 00:37:58,870
to make sure you're not infected with any dangerous viruses

790
00:37:59,500 --> 00:38:01,490
Tanaka

791
00:38:01,890 --> 00:38:03,440
You ready?

792
00:38:04,550 --> 00:38:10,110
Stand on the footprints, and the machine will engage

793
00:38:10,110 --> 00:38:11,310
"Should" engage?

794
00:38:13,900 --> 00:38:15,400
Tanaka

795
00:38:15,630 --> 00:38:17,760
Go right ahead

796
00:38:16,600 --> 00:38:18,890
How about "It'll automatically engage?"

797
00:38:23,840 --> 00:38:25,020
I had to point that out

798
00:38:25,020 --> 00:38:27,130
"Should" engage is not OK by me

799
00:38:27,580 --> 00:38:29,700
I understand but...

800
00:38:35,140 --> 00:38:36,300
Let's go, Tanaka

801
00:38:38,790 --> 00:38:42,310
It's a little scary

802
00:38:42,310 --> 00:38:44,980
Nobody likes to be startled

803
00:38:45,240 --> 00:38:46,700
I'm scared

804
00:38:52,600 --> 00:38:54,860
Virus check complete

805
00:38:54,860 --> 00:38:56,970
The subject is clear

806
00:38:57,290 --> 00:38:58,720
Entrance granted

807
00:38:59,010 --> 00:39:00,280
You're OK, Tanaka

808
00:39:00,730 --> 00:39:03,230
I'm good, thank God

809
00:39:04,180 --> 00:39:04,940
Hamada, you're up

810
00:39:07,070 --> 00:39:08,630
Puu

811
00:39:08,870 --> 00:39:11,840
Shouldn't the farting affect the outcome?

812
00:39:12,100 --> 00:39:14,460
He might get a false positive

813
00:39:15,880 --> 00:39:19,730
Virus scan complete
Subject is clear

814
00:39:19,820 --> 00:39:21,640
Entrance granted

815
00:39:24,520 --> 00:39:26,920
Endo, you're next

816
00:39:29,020 --> 00:39:30,760
I don't wanna be last...

817
00:39:35,720 --> 00:39:39,860
Virus has been detected

818
00:39:39,860 --> 00:39:40,910
I knew it'd be Endo

819
00:39:40,910 --> 00:39:42,320
Entrance Denied

820
00:39:45,050 --> 00:39:49,640
Virus Disenfection Complete

821
00:39:50,580 --> 00:39:54,040
Endou should be cleared of all viruses

822
00:40:03,430 --> 00:40:04,550
No way!

823
00:40:08,280 --> 00:40:11,410
Could you let me enter already?

824
00:40:17,100 --> 00:40:20,140
Virus Check Clear

825
00:40:18,790 --> 00:40:20,970
Matsumoto safely clears the virus check

826
00:40:21,810 --> 00:40:23,810
But then there was Yamazaki...

827
00:40:28,240 --> 00:40:32,370
Active virus found! Active virus found!

828
00:40:33,220 --> 00:40:35,610
Virus Disinfectant Spray

829
00:40:43,040 --> 00:40:46,330
With that over, we can have peace of mind

830
00:40:43,600 --> 00:40:48,130
Fujiwara Enters Without Being Checked

831
00:40:46,230 --> 00:40:47,460
Pfffh

832
00:40:47,120 --> 00:40:48,240
Could I have you look at this...

833
00:40:48,240 --> 00:40:50,240
It's the GIA reception desk

834
00:40:48,530 --> 00:40:53,880
Reception Desk

835
00:40:50,810 --> 00:40:52,420
That's just messed up

836
00:40:54,160 --> 00:40:55,670
Huh,

837
00:40:55,670 --> 00:40:58,130
Hmm, the receptionist doesn't seem to be here...

838
00:40:56,900 --> 00:40:58,740
Argh, this again?

839
00:41:08,180 --> 00:41:09,750
Huh?

840
00:41:09,750 --> 00:41:12,260
Huh? The receptionist isn't here...

841
00:41:11,750 --> 00:41:13,750
How many times are they going to...

842
00:41:21,370 --> 00:41:23,040
Pretty cool

843
00:41:28,440 --> 00:41:32,880
Receptionist

844
00:41:28,440 --> 00:41:32,880
Rino Katase

845
00:41:35,390 --> 00:41:36,790
This isn't alright

846
00:41:37,070 --> 00:41:39,690
She just smiled at me

847
00:41:43,160 --> 00:41:45,510
Ooh! That hurt!

848
00:41:46,900 --> 00:41:49,640
Hello, Fujiwara-san

849
00:41:49,640 --> 00:41:51,640
Good morning, ma'am

850
00:41:50,810 --> 00:41:51,650
Thank you for coming

851
00:41:53,610 --> 00:41:57,520
This is GIA's lovely receptionist, Rino-san

852
00:41:57,520 --> 00:41:59,700
And who would these gentlemen be?

853
00:41:59,700 --> 00:42:02,020
These bums are new spies in training

854
00:42:02,020 --> 00:42:05,790
They're all pleased to meet your acquaintance

855
00:42:05,790 --> 00:42:07,790
It's a pleasure meeting you all

856
00:42:08,250 --> 00:42:11,260
Your name, my good sir?

857
00:42:11,260 --> 00:42:13,390
Ah, my name is Matsumoto

858
00:42:13,390 --> 00:42:14,840
And are you married?

859
00:42:14,840 --> 00:42:16,840
Yes, I have a beautiful wife

860
00:42:16,840 --> 00:42:18,640
Any children?

861
00:42:18,640 --> 00:42:19,980
Yeah, I have one child.

862
00:42:19,980 --> 00:42:23,000
You must be working hard then

863
00:42:22,880 --> 00:42:24,880
Yes...

864
00:42:25,060 --> 00:42:26,880
By the way,

865
00:42:26,880 --> 00:42:28,880
I'm thinking about cooking dinner

866
00:42:28,880 --> 00:42:31,710
for a person who's really close to my heart

867
00:42:31,710 --> 00:42:33,950
What would you suggest that I cook?

868
00:42:33,950 --> 00:42:35,120
Gee, what would be good?

869
00:42:35,120 --> 00:42:37,300
Well...

870
00:42:37,300 --> 00:42:38,920
Something like a meat and potato stew...

871
00:42:38,920 --> 00:42:40,170
A nice family-orientated meal,but...

872
00:42:40,170 --> 00:42:41,270
A nice family-orientated meal, but...

873
00:42:41,270 --> 00:42:42,940
His taste for food

874
00:42:42,940 --> 00:42:45,400
is not very sophisticated

875
00:42:45,680 --> 00:42:47,190
How about a hamburger!

876
00:42:46,350 --> 00:42:47,970
How does that sound?

877
00:42:48,420 --> 00:42:50,600
How about a Hamburger?

878
00:42:50,600 --> 00:42:52,600
What did you just say?!

879
00:42:53,000 --> 00:42:55,070
You said "Hamburger"!?

880
00:42:55,070 --> 00:42:59,260
Are you asking me to smack you upside the head?

881
00:42:59,360 --> 00:43:03,500
The Receptionist Loses Her Marbles

882
00:43:03,900 --> 00:43:08,030
My brother's 20-year jail term is up

883
00:43:08,030 --> 00:43:09,910
and you recommend hamburgers

884
00:43:10,030 --> 00:43:12,280
covered with demi-glaze sauce!?

885
00:43:12,280 --> 00:43:15,240
The day I offer something that foul,

886
00:43:15,240 --> 00:43:17,920
is the day every member of my family gets killed!!

887
00:43:17,920 --> 00:43:19,320
You dumbass!!

888
00:43:19,350 --> 00:43:23,790
Receptionist Has Yakuza Affiliations

889
00:43:25,180 --> 00:43:26,970
What is her problem?

890
00:43:34,350 --> 00:43:35,690
Oh the pain, that must've hurt!

891
00:43:35,690 --> 00:43:37,690
He got you good

892
00:43:37,690 --> 00:43:40,940
Hello, and your name is?

893
00:43:40,940 --> 00:43:42,000
I'm Yamasaki

894
00:43:42,000 --> 00:43:44,240
My friend's son is getting married and...

895
00:43:44,240 --> 00:43:46,860
and I was asked to sing a song at the reception

896
00:43:46,860 --> 00:43:50,210
What's the perfect wedding song?

897
00:43:48,760 --> 00:43:50,210
Well, you can't go wrong with

898
00:43:50,210 --> 00:43:51,880
"Tentou Mushi no Samba" (The Ladybug's Samba)

899
00:43:51,880 --> 00:43:53,290
How does that go?

900
00:43:53,450 --> 00:43:57,420
You and I in our dream land,

901
00:43:57,420 --> 00:44:01,000
A small church in the grove was where we had our wedding...

902
00:43:59,820 --> 00:44:01,000
Uh, Wh-wha-what?

903
00:44:01,000 --> 00:44:04,240
Grove? Say that again

904
00:44:01,890 --> 00:44:07,480
In a small church down by the grove,

905
00:44:04,290 --> 00:44:07,480
was where we had our wedding party

906
00:44:05,910 --> 00:44:07,480
Uh, What kind of church?

907
00:44:07,480 --> 00:44:08,150
Uhm...

908
00:44:08,480 --> 00:44:10,940
A small church down by the grove,

909
00:44:10,940 --> 00:44:12,940
was where we had our wedding party...

910
00:44:13,120 --> 00:44:14,940
What was THAT?

911
00:44:14,940 --> 00:44:17,700
It's at a SMALL church!?

912
00:44:17,700 --> 00:44:18,940
DUMBASS!

913
00:44:24,240 --> 00:44:26,420
This party is...

914
00:44:26,420 --> 00:44:28,920
so huge that 800 members from

915
00:44:28,940 --> 00:44:32,960
Osaka to Himeji will attend

916
00:44:31,560 --> 00:44:32,960
What is she talking about!?

917
00:44:32,960 --> 00:44:35,750
And you're suggesting that

918
00:44:35,810 --> 00:44:38,990
I sing a song about a reception at a "small" church?!

919
00:44:38,990 --> 00:44:41,900
I would be killed, of course

920
00:44:41,900 --> 00:44:44,080
Think about this

921
00:44:44,080 --> 00:44:50,280
could 800 people fit into a SMALL church?

922
00:44:56,950 --> 00:44:59,460
DUMBASS!

923
00:45:02,980 --> 00:45:06,060
This is really exhausting

924
00:45:11,760 --> 00:45:13,490
My, oh my!

925
00:45:13,490 --> 00:45:16,900
What a menacing attitude we've got here.

926
00:45:16,000 --> 00:45:18,120
Who are you!?

927
00:45:18,120 --> 00:45:22,040
Big sis, if you want to stay young

928
00:45:18,120 --> 00:45:22,040
Mineko Nishikawa

929
00:45:18,120 --> 00:45:22,040
Receptionist

930
00:45:22,590 --> 00:45:29,130
Even though the members have already laughed, please enjoy this skit without interruption

931
00:45:23,560 --> 00:45:26,700
stop letting things get to you all the time

932
00:45:26,900 --> 00:45:27,900
What was that!?

933
00:45:27,900 --> 00:45:29,630
Amazing cast..

934
00:45:30,030 --> 00:45:33,760
I happen to think a "small church down by the grove"

935
00:45:34,010 --> 00:45:37,070
is lovely

936
00:45:37,070 --> 00:45:39,890
Since when are you such a hot-shot,

937
00:45:39,970 --> 00:45:42,220
showing up right now like this

938
00:45:42,260 --> 00:45:44,550
Oh, I'm so scared

939
00:45:44,550 --> 00:45:49,250
This doesn't change the fact that your husband

940
00:45:49,250 --> 00:45:53,320
doesn't have any balls

941
00:45:53,320 --> 00:45:58,690
Sounds to me like you're asking for it

942
00:45:59,640 --> 00:46:02,490
You wish!

943
00:46:02,490 --> 00:46:04,780
Is that so?

944
00:46:04,780 --> 00:46:09,580
Then prepare for the worst!

945
00:46:12,940 --> 00:46:16,960
Woah, Woah, Woah, Hey, Hey, Hey!!

946
00:46:14,670 --> 00:46:18,970
Happy Boy

947
00:46:14,670 --> 00:46:18,970
Okada Masuda

948
00:46:18,970 --> 00:46:21,430
WoOAOoW!

949
00:46:20,040 --> 00:46:21,630
That's his only line

950
00:46:24,280 --> 00:46:26,120
What the heck is with him!?

951
00:46:24,840 --> 00:46:27,910
I don't get him at all

952
00:46:29,140 --> 00:46:31,320
Could we just chill, chill, chill, chill!

953
00:46:31,320 --> 00:46:33,320
Oh and it comes out!

954
00:46:33,320 --> 00:46:35,900
Oh, hang on a second

955
00:46:35,900 --> 00:46:38,080
Excuse me as I go to the front

956
00:46:38,080 --> 00:46:39,870
Oh my, oh my,

957
00:46:39,870 --> 00:46:41,660
You're Hijese-san, no, that's not it

958
00:46:41,660 --> 00:46:43,890
She's Udese-san, no I'm still off

959
00:46:43,890 --> 00:46:45,900
I got it! She's Katase-san,

960
00:46:45,900 --> 00:46:46,930
WoOAOoW!!

961
00:46:49,090 --> 00:46:51,150
And in this corner,

962
00:46:51,150 --> 00:46:52,110
Nishikawa-san!!

963
00:46:52,130 --> 00:46:53,280
That was quick!

964
00:46:53,280 --> 00:46:54,920
And I'm just as quick in the bedroom

965
00:46:54,940 --> 00:46:56,070
WoOAOoW!

966
00:46:57,240 --> 00:46:58,750
Okada OUT!

967
00:46:58,750 --> 00:47:00,480
OUCH!

968
00:47:00,480 --> 00:47:01,380
He sure is loud

969
00:47:01,380 --> 00:47:03,950
Thank you!  Thank you so very much

970
00:47:03,950 --> 00:47:05,950
Ok, Ok, Ok, Here we go

971
00:47:05,950 --> 00:47:06,740
Shall we have a Sumo match?

972
00:47:06,740 --> 00:47:07,970
Ready!?

973
00:47:07,970 --> 00:47:08,980
Fight!

974
00:47:08,980 --> 00:47:11,490
Keep Going! Keep Going! Keep Go~ing!

975
00:47:11,490 --> 00:47:14,400
And I want to keep going in show business!

976
00:47:14,400 --> 00:47:15,630
WoOAOoW!

977
00:47:15,630 --> 00:47:17,630
Happy Bo~y!

978
00:47:17,630 --> 00:47:19,630
WoOAOoW!

979
00:47:26,130 --> 00:47:28,700
I'm slowly dy....

980
00:47:26,130 --> 00:47:29,930
SHUT THE HELL UP AND DIE!

981
00:47:29,870 --> 00:47:32,280
I'm falling like a leaf!

982
00:47:33,060 --> 00:47:38,370
Happy Boy Killed in the Line of Duty

983
00:47:36,300 --> 00:47:38,370
You guys wanna get shot, too?

984
00:47:41,830 --> 00:47:43,610
Wrong place at the wrong time

985
00:47:43,680 --> 00:47:44,890
Let's go

986
00:47:47,890 --> 00:47:49,140
I'm fine with being OUT

987
00:47:59,210 --> 00:48:01,220
Happy Boy bit the bullet

988
00:48:01,220 --> 00:48:02,730
Happy Boy was killed

989
00:48:02,730 --> 00:48:04,730
Yeah, he was shot...

990
00:48:08,820 --> 00:48:12,560
Pretty amazing reception though

991
00:48:18,930 --> 00:48:20,660
So Happy Boy is dead

992
00:48:20,670 --> 00:48:21,600
I was his fan

993
00:48:22,000 --> 00:48:25,410
This way!

994
00:48:22,730 --> 00:48:25,410
We're going down again!?

995
00:48:27,030 --> 00:48:30,940
We're on our way to meet with the Director

996
00:48:30,940 --> 00:48:33,960
Everyone, be on your best behavior!

997
00:48:34,410 --> 00:48:35,410
Excuse us!

998
00:48:34,410 --> 00:48:38,650
Director's Office

999
00:48:37,030 --> 00:48:38,540
Excuse us!

1000
00:48:39,040 --> 00:48:40,540
Excuse us!

1001
00:48:41,950 --> 00:48:47,700
The order goes Matsumoto, Hamada, Endou, Tanaka, Yamasaki

1002
00:48:48,710 --> 00:48:53,790
Per your request, sir, I'm here with the new spies

1003
00:48:54,860 --> 00:48:58,990
Director

1004
00:48:54,860 --> 00:48:58,990
Nakamura Masatoshi

1005
00:49:00,440 --> 00:49:05,080
Per your request, sir, I'm here with new spies

1006
00:49:06,920 --> 00:49:09,440
Director

1007
00:49:06,920 --> 00:49:09,440
Masatoshi Nakamura

1008
00:49:14,300 --> 00:49:15,920
Is this for real!?

1009
00:49:24,190 --> 00:49:27,820
So you are the new spies

1010
00:49:27,820 --> 00:49:29,820
And I am...

1011
00:49:30,950 --> 00:49:33,120
I am Nakamura, GIA's Director

1012
00:49:33,310 --> 00:49:34,720
Pleased to meet you

1013
00:49:34,720 --> 00:49:36,720
Pleased to be working under you!

1014
00:49:38,010 --> 00:49:39,680
Welcome

1015
00:49:41,680 --> 00:49:43,680
Nice and close

1016
00:49:43,320 --> 00:49:45,160
Welcome

1017
00:49:47,620 --> 00:49:48,900
Welcome

1018
00:49:47,860 --> 00:49:49,910
Nice to meet you

1019
00:49:48,900 --> 00:49:50,470
Pleasure's all mine

1020
00:49:51,530 --> 00:49:55,440
In previous batsu games, Yamasaki gets ignored when first greeted by the boss

1021
00:49:51,530 --> 00:49:55,440
Is Yamasaki getting ignored again?

1022
00:49:51,600 --> 00:49:53,000
Will Yamasaki get ignored again?

1023
00:49:51,600 --> 00:49:53,730
I expected a prank here

1024
00:49:54,300 --> 00:49:57,710
Will Yamasaki get ignored again this year??

1025
00:50:02,640 --> 00:50:03,810
That's so bad, right!

1026
00:50:04,710 --> 00:50:05,800
That's just mean!

1027
00:50:06,380 --> 00:50:10,850
Yamazaki Punched in the Stomach

1028
00:50:06,710 --> 00:50:08,050
I didn't expect that

1029
00:50:08,050 --> 00:50:09,680
That's must have hurt

1030
00:50:09,680 --> 00:50:12,020
That was really messed up!

1031
00:50:14,750 --> 00:50:16,990
I thought he would just
ignore him

1032
00:50:19,160 --> 00:50:22,370
I wasn't expecting
that to happen

1033
00:50:24,030 --> 00:50:27,040
And he also got his butt slapped

1034
00:50:27,430 --> 00:50:29,330
He got hit twice

1035
00:50:29,330 --> 00:50:30,770
That's not good

1036
00:50:30,770 --> 00:50:33,310
A spy needs a code name,

1037
00:50:33,350 --> 00:50:37,310
so he can keep his secret identity

1038
00:50:37,380 --> 00:50:40,410
So on your behalf...

1039
00:50:41,850 --> 00:50:45,220
I'll assign a code name to each of you

1040
00:50:45,180 --> 00:50:50,220
Code Name Assignments

1041
00:50:47,020 --> 00:50:48,480
Let's see...

1042
00:50:49,520 --> 00:50:50,220
Your name?

1043
00:50:50,690 --> 00:50:51,390
It's Matsumoto

1044
00:50:51,490 --> 00:50:53,030
Your first name?

1045
00:50:52,290 --> 00:50:53,030
Hitoshi

1046
00:50:53,530 --> 00:50:54,430
Matsumoto Hitoshi?

1047
00:50:54,430 --> 00:50:55,530
Yes

1048
00:50:55,530 --> 00:50:56,760
Matsumoto Hitoshi

1049
00:50:57,030 --> 00:50:58,530
Let me see...

1050
00:50:58,760 --> 00:51:03,270
"Kobonnou" (Doting parent)

1051
00:51:06,160 --> 00:51:07,520
Your expression says a lot

1052
00:51:06,940 --> 00:51:12,980
This building is very secure, so you will need a password

1053
00:51:13,180 --> 00:51:16,280
Matsumoto will be "883"

1054
00:51:19,720 --> 00:51:20,450
"Papa-san"

1055
00:51:20,620 --> 00:51:25,860
Pa(8)pa(8) San(3)

1056
00:51:27,290 --> 00:51:28,860
Ok, next...

1057
00:51:29,400 --> 00:51:30,860
Hamada-kun

1058
00:51:30,350 --> 00:51:30,860
Yes

1059
00:51:30,860 --> 00:51:34,100
Oops, how did I already know who you were?!!

1060
00:51:34,130 --> 00:51:36,640
I just said it, didn't I?

1061
00:51:39,940 --> 00:51:41,640
He said it himself!

1062
00:51:48,150 --> 00:51:49,120
I'm Hamada

1063
00:51:49,600 --> 00:51:50,580
What's your first name?

1064
00:51:50,010 --> 00:51:52,050
Masatoshi

1065
00:51:51,000 --> 00:51:52,050
Masatoshi?

1066
00:51:52,580 --> 00:51:54,890
Really?  Masatoshi is your real name?

1067
00:51:55,050 --> 00:51:56,190
Yes

1068
00:51:56,620 --> 00:51:59,790
Wow, that's a great name. Same as mine!

1069
00:52:01,160 --> 00:52:04,100
For such a good name... let's see...

1070
00:52:04,430 --> 00:52:06,350
Your code name is..."Busaiku"(Ugly)

1071
00:52:06,350 --> 00:52:08,700
Your code name is..."Busaiku"(Ugly)

1072
00:52:14,110 --> 00:52:16,510
It didn't matter
what my name was

1073
00:52:23,050 --> 00:52:25,550
Oh, yes, your password...

1074
00:52:26,020 --> 00:52:27,090
"723"

1075
00:52:27,590 --> 00:52:29,760
Seven hundred and twenty three

1076
00:52:30,620 --> 00:52:32,750
"Natsumi"

1077
00:52:31,290 --> 00:52:36,230
Na(7)tsu(2)mi(3) (wife's name)

1078
00:52:36,860 --> 00:52:39,230
We should get slapped for
sticking out our tongues

1079
00:52:39,230 --> 00:52:40,630
Yes, we're hiding our laughter

1080
00:52:41,170 --> 00:52:43,000
And your name is?

1081
00:52:43,740 --> 00:52:45,400
Endou Shozo

1082
00:52:45,500 --> 00:52:47,420
Your code name..."Dohentai" (Super perverted)

1083
00:52:47,420 --> 00:52:50,340
Your code name..."Dohentai" (Super perverted)

1084
00:52:51,440 --> 00:52:53,880
Your password is "168"

1085
00:52:55,580 --> 00:52:58,650
"Iroha"

1086
00:52:56,280 --> 00:52:59,380
Endo's daughter

1087
00:52:56,280 --> 00:52:59,380
I(1)ro(6)ha(8)

1088
00:52:59,380 --> 00:53:01,150
Next, your name?

1089
00:53:02,190 --> 00:53:03,660
Tanaka

1090
00:53:02,850 --> 00:53:03,660
Your first name is?

1091
00:53:04,190 --> 00:53:04,910
Naoki

1092
00:53:04,960 --> 00:53:06,070
Tanaka Naoki

1093
00:53:07,990 --> 00:53:09,740
Ok, your code name is..."Naoki"

1094
00:53:09,740 --> 00:53:13,780
Ok, your code name is..."Naoki"

1095
00:53:28,880 --> 00:53:30,380
Ok, your password...

1096
00:53:31,420 --> 00:53:33,280
"931"

1097
00:53:34,520 --> 00:53:37,760
Ku(9)sa(3)i(1) (Stink)

1098
00:53:36,320 --> 00:53:38,390
You'll never be anything but that

1099
00:53:38,820 --> 00:53:40,390
And your name is?

1100
00:53:40,690 --> 00:53:41,660
Yamasaki

1101
00:53:41,660 --> 00:53:42,590
Your first name?

1102
00:53:42,590 --> 00:53:43,330
Hosei

1103
00:53:43,330 --> 00:53:45,860
Ok, let's think of a code name...

1104
00:53:46,430 --> 00:53:50,600
"Makiguso-Taro" (Rolling Shit Taro)

1105
00:53:56,880 --> 00:53:58,640
Where did he get that?

1106
00:53:59,710 --> 00:54:01,580
Yeah, Makiguso-Taro

1107
00:54:01,580 --> 00:54:03,920
He didn't like you at all

1108
00:54:03,920 --> 00:54:05,420
No, he didn't

1109
00:54:05,420 --> 00:54:07,420
Ok, your password...

1110
00:54:07,820 --> 00:54:09,790
"361"

1111
00:54:11,320 --> 00:54:17,060
Sa(3)mu(6)i(1) (No talent)

1112
00:54:15,160 --> 00:54:16,900
Look at his expression

1113
00:54:17,760 --> 00:54:19,800
Yeah, he should've
punched him again

1114
00:54:20,800 --> 00:54:22,830
Before I forget

1115
00:54:22,830 --> 00:54:25,500
I need to hand out your IDs

1116
00:54:29,140 --> 00:54:30,910
This is yours, Yamasaki

1117
00:54:31,410 --> 00:54:32,910
And yours...

1118
00:54:35,510 --> 00:54:36,420
Hamada-kun

1119
00:54:37,850 --> 00:54:38,780
Matsumoto

1120
00:54:39,220 --> 00:54:41,050
and here is yours

1121
00:54:41,390 --> 00:54:50,460
Picture: Jiro Todoroki

1122
00:54:45,990 --> 00:54:48,390
This isn't me...

1123
00:54:51,560 --> 00:54:52,900
It kinda looked like you

1124
00:54:54,430 --> 00:54:57,540
This is... not me

1125
00:54:57,540 --> 00:54:58,540
Wrong photo

1126
00:55:01,470 --> 00:55:02,410
Sir...

1127
00:55:03,410 --> 00:55:05,210
This is not me

1128
00:55:06,080 --> 00:55:06,780
The photo is...

1129
00:55:07,250 --> 00:55:08,780
I think it's a mistake

1130
00:55:08,580 --> 00:55:09,480
It's not a mistake

1131
00:55:10,320 --> 00:55:10,970
Look,

1132
00:55:11,130 --> 00:55:13,380
Everyone, come and see

1133
00:55:14,090 --> 00:55:15,320
It's him, right?

1134
00:55:15,320 --> 00:55:16,590
It is, right?

1135
00:55:17,060 --> 00:55:18,590
It's not

1136
00:55:19,290 --> 00:55:20,190
It is right?

1137
00:55:21,230 --> 00:55:22,890
It is right!!  Look!!

1138
00:55:23,360 --> 00:55:24,560
Right?!

1139
00:55:23,870 --> 00:55:25,150
Yes, sir

1140
00:55:25,400 --> 00:55:26,070
Right, that's him

1141
00:55:26,190 --> 00:55:27,910
Yes it's him

1142
00:55:27,870 --> 00:55:29,070
What's wrong with you?

1143
00:55:29,330 --> 00:55:30,310
But this is a photo of...

1144
00:55:30,350 --> 00:55:31,170
It's you!

1145
00:55:31,500 --> 00:55:33,240
It's Jiro Todoroki

1146
00:55:32,370 --> 00:55:33,590
Who?

1147
00:55:33,440 --> 00:55:34,610
It's you

1148
00:55:34,840 --> 00:55:36,940
Isn't this Jiro Todoroki's picture?

1149
00:55:38,110 --> 00:55:39,850
It's you, right?

1150
00:55:51,690 --> 00:55:54,060
Ok, I'm sorry, I'll take it

1151
00:55:55,530 --> 00:55:57,690
I would usually end our meeting now,

1152
00:55:57,710 --> 00:56:00,600
but I have something private to talk about

1153
00:56:00,870 --> 00:56:05,550
Actually, I have to perform at a New Year's party

1154
00:56:05,700 --> 00:56:11,190
I want you to watch me practice and give me some feedback

1155
00:56:11,410 --> 00:56:13,550
Ok!  Please come in!

1156
00:56:18,320 --> 00:56:22,090
Actually, I have to perform at a New Year's party

1157
00:56:23,060 --> 00:56:28,160
I want you to watch me practice and give me some feedback

1158
00:56:28,290 --> 00:56:30,530
Ok! Please come in!

1159
00:56:43,710 --> 00:56:47,050
Hidenori Kikuchi

1160
00:56:43,710 --> 00:56:47,050
Itsumo Koko Kara

1161
00:56:43,710 --> 00:56:47,050
Itsumo Koko Kara

1162
00:56:43,710 --> 00:56:47,050
Kazunori Yamada

1163
00:56:49,950 --> 00:56:51,450
It's sad when...

1164
00:56:51,750 --> 00:56:53,090
It's sad when...

1165
00:56:53,150 --> 00:56:54,920
when someone dies!

1166
00:56:54,920 --> 00:56:56,490
It's sad when...

1167
00:56:56,720 --> 00:56:59,060
when someone dies!

1168
00:56:59,060 --> 00:57:01,060
It's nice and loud
- Yeah

1169
00:57:00,190 --> 00:57:01,960
It's sad when...

1170
00:57:02,090 --> 00:57:08,590
when I walk down the street and someone calls me Minister instead of Prime Minister!

1171
00:57:02,130 --> 00:57:03,700
It's sad when...

1172
00:57:08,970 --> 00:57:14,610
It's sad when I walk down the street and someone calls me Minister instead of Prime Minister!

1173
00:57:14,610 --> 00:57:15,940
It's sad when...

1174
00:57:16,210 --> 00:57:24,050
It's sad that Guzuroku looked so old on "Sanma Goten"--like a totally different person!

1175
00:57:24,650 --> 00:57:30,460
It's sad that Guzuroku looked so old on "Sanma Goten"--like a totally different person!

1176
00:57:34,280 --> 00:57:36,040
Is this how it's gonna be?

1177
00:57:46,840 --> 00:57:48,410
It's sad when...

1178
00:57:48,570 --> 00:57:50,180
It's sad when...

1179
00:57:50,340 --> 00:57:55,610
Omeda put his heart and soul into playing a strange-looking flute on Tetsuko No Heya!

1180
00:57:55,850 --> 00:58:02,260
It's sad when Omeda put his heart and soul into playing a strange-looking flute on Tetsuko No Heya!

1181
00:58:06,060 --> 00:58:08,890
It wasn't a flute. It was a Quena

1182
00:58:15,930 --> 00:58:17,570
It's sad when...

1183
00:58:17,570 --> 00:58:19,170
It's sad when...

1184
00:58:19,400 --> 00:58:27,380
My former student at Yuhigaoka High school married a foul-mouthed comedian from Kansai without much thought!

1185
00:58:27,380 --> 00:58:34,150
It's sad that my former student at Yuhigaoka High school married a foul-mouthed comedian from Kansai without much thought!

1186
00:58:30,880 --> 00:58:36,890
Natsumi Ogawa 16yrs old
(Hamada's wife)

1187
00:58:45,160 --> 00:58:48,630
This concludes our practice performance

1188
00:58:48,630 --> 00:58:49,900
You are dismissed

1189
00:58:50,570 --> 00:58:53,140
Thank you very much

1190
00:58:55,610 --> 00:58:57,910
This is so hard

1191
00:58:58,580 --> 00:59:01,410
Yamachan's stomach punch was really terrible

1192
00:59:01,410 --> 00:59:06,150
Considering his character, you would never expect that from him

1193
00:59:06,150 --> 00:59:08,720
More understandable if Takeuchi Riki did it (last year)

1194
00:59:09,990 --> 00:59:15,290
So this year they want to associate famous actors with comedians

1195
00:59:16,390 --> 00:59:22,300
2nd Floor Hallway

1196
00:59:22,430 --> 00:59:26,910
Training Room Entrance

1197
00:59:22,700 --> 00:59:24,840
Please let me rest a while!

1198
00:59:26,000 --> 00:59:32,880
Ok, This is a room for newly hired spies

1199
00:59:32,880 --> 00:59:35,950
For security reasons, you need authorization

1200
00:59:36,150 --> 00:59:47,460
Required for Entry: I.D. Card - Password - Palm Print

1201
00:59:36,150 --> 00:59:47,460
Security Authentication System

1202
00:59:36,750 --> 00:59:39,830
I need you to swipe your cards one at a time

1203
00:59:39,850 --> 00:59:44,450
Then enter the 3 digit code given to you by the director

1204
00:59:44,490 --> 00:59:47,730
The door will open only after all of you are clear

1205
00:59:48,150 --> 00:59:48,680
Matsumoto

1206
00:59:49,030 --> 00:59:51,000
This isn't me on the i.d.

1207
00:59:51,680 --> 00:59:56,680
Slide your card and enter your password

1208
00:59:56,770 --> 00:59:58,540
What's your password?

1209
00:59:57,190 --> 00:59:59,880
Look at Hamada getting away with laughing

1210
00:59:58,770 --> 01:00:00,040
Let me see...

1211
01:00:00,040 --> 01:00:01,440
Papa-san (883)

1212
01:00:00,380 --> 01:00:01,230
That's right

1213
01:00:06,190 --> 01:00:07,500
What happened?

1214
01:00:07,500 --> 01:00:09,170
How could you forget?

1215
01:00:14,610 --> 01:00:15,300
Pa

1216
01:00:14,750 --> 01:00:19,990
Papa--san

1217
01:00:15,300 --> 01:00:16,280
Pa

1218
01:00:16,280 --> 01:00:18,320
San

1219
01:00:18,330 --> 01:00:20,490
Press "enter" and

1220
01:00:20,490 --> 01:00:22,320
place your hand on the scanner

1221
01:00:23,150 --> 01:00:24,980
How cumbersome...

1222
01:00:27,000 --> 01:00:28,180
You were laughing there, too

1223
01:00:29,270 --> 01:00:30,270
Alright

1224
01:00:30,270 --> 01:00:32,170
I'd say he was laughing

1225
01:00:34,410 --> 01:00:36,350
Seriously, he was laughing

1226
01:00:36,350 --> 01:00:37,810
Like nobody's business

1227
01:00:37,810 --> 01:00:39,550
How could you not know to use your right hand?

1228
01:00:41,190 --> 01:00:44,440
I can't believe you laughed at that

1229
01:00:44,670 --> 01:00:46,080
Let's go, Hamada

1230
01:00:46,060 --> 01:00:55,530
Natsumi

1231
01:00:46,130 --> 01:00:49,210
Swipe your card and what's your password?

1232
01:00:49,190 --> 01:00:50,280
723

1233
01:00:50,420 --> 01:00:52,070
How did you remember that?

1234
01:00:52,340 --> 01:00:53,950
So you set it up like that...

1235
01:00:59,520 --> 01:01:01,180
Why didn't you answer him?

1236
01:01:04,100 --> 01:01:06,540
Fujiwara, you gotta get him to answer

1237
01:01:06,570 --> 01:01:07,540
Endou

1238
01:01:07,310 --> 01:01:08,730
But this isn't really me...

1239
01:01:09,050 --> 01:01:10,840
Don't bring that up every time

1240
01:01:10,880 --> 01:01:11,910
And don't show that to us

1241
01:01:11,910 --> 01:01:18,550
Iroha

1242
01:01:12,560 --> 01:01:13,650
Password?

1243
01:01:13,730 --> 01:01:15,220
168...

1244
01:01:15,490 --> 01:01:16,520
How'd you remember that?

1245
01:01:16,520 --> 01:01:18,570
Iroha (168) is my daughter's name

1246
01:01:18,600 --> 01:01:19,850
Scan your hand there

1247
01:01:26,890 --> 01:01:29,230
Mr. Todoroki is OK to enter now, too

1248
01:01:29,230 --> 01:01:31,030
Quiet

1249
01:01:32,230 --> 01:01:40,850
Kusai

1250
01:01:32,320 --> 01:01:33,750
Swipe your card and..

1251
01:01:33,750 --> 01:01:35,780
Use the keypad up here

1252
01:01:35,780 --> 01:01:37,320
9..3..1...

1253
01:01:37,380 --> 01:01:38,580
How'd you remember that?

1254
01:01:38,180 --> 01:01:40,300
Kusai (Stinky) (931)

1255
01:01:43,900 --> 01:01:45,210
Yamasaki, you're the last one

1256
01:01:46,650 --> 01:01:54,650
Samui

1257
01:01:48,170 --> 01:01:49,390
Password?

1258
01:01:50,920 --> 01:01:53,320
Rolling Shit Taro?

1259
01:01:53,320 --> 01:01:54,770
No, your 3-digit code

1260
01:01:54,770 --> 01:01:56,120
What the hell...?

1261
01:01:59,150 --> 01:02:02,650
ID Authenticated

1262
01:02:00,790 --> 01:02:03,300
Security Door Unlocked

1263
01:02:02,630 --> 01:02:04,410
Entrance granted

1264
01:02:08,700 --> 01:02:11,840
Could it turn any slower?

1265
01:02:24,110 --> 01:02:26,910
Why not make the door unlock quicker?

1266
01:02:28,920 --> 01:02:31,590
Shouldn't it unlock a little quicker?

1267
01:02:31,950 --> 01:02:33,780
Nice room

1268
01:02:33,780 --> 01:02:36,730
This will be your training room for the day

1269
01:02:36,730 --> 01:02:40,830
Sit in your assigned seats

1270
01:02:41,900 --> 01:02:44,170
You're in my seat

1271
01:02:44,670 --> 01:02:46,170
Huh?

1272
01:02:45,290 --> 01:02:47,760
Find your seats, please

1273
01:02:48,780 --> 01:02:50,880
I said you're in my seat

1274
01:02:51,690 --> 01:02:52,720
Sorry about that

1275
01:02:56,470 --> 01:02:58,630
It's nice and toasty in here

1276
01:02:58,630 --> 01:02:59,840
Nice and warm

1277
01:03:01,590 --> 01:03:03,590
Enjoy your break time

1278
01:03:04,160 --> 01:03:06,590
I would like to hit the bathroom

1279
01:03:06,850 --> 01:03:08,050
Are we free to go?

1280
01:03:10,630 --> 01:03:12,790
Shall we just go then?

1281
01:03:13,130 --> 01:03:14,460
I'm cold

1282
01:03:15,760 --> 01:03:19,840
A welcomed break after a rough start to the morning

1283
01:03:21,750 --> 01:03:23,370
I wouldn't call this a break

1284
01:03:25,240 --> 01:03:28,910
However, nobody expects a bathroom attack

1285
01:03:30,810 --> 01:03:34,790
Your only hot beverage choice is coffee

1286
01:03:34,790 --> 01:03:38,100
Well, I'm seeing some tea bags here

1287
01:03:38,100 --> 01:03:41,030
Man, how dare they use the left over "Suga Tea"

1288
01:03:41,030 --> 01:03:42,380
Ah, long time no see

1289
01:03:41,480 --> 01:03:43,960
Suga Tea

1290
01:03:46,500 --> 01:03:48,630
I can't get it out...

1291
01:03:49,000 --> 01:03:50,140
Bump

1292
01:03:52,240 --> 01:03:53,670
Bump!

1293
01:03:55,470 --> 01:03:57,220
What the hell...??

1294
01:03:58,890 --> 01:04:01,850
He's laughing, slap him now

1295
01:04:02,620 --> 01:04:04,090
Of course, he's OUT

1296
01:04:04,090 --> 01:04:06,470
You didn't even try to fight the urge to laugh

1297
01:04:06,470 --> 01:04:08,350
What just happened in the bathroom?

1298
01:04:08,490 --> 01:04:10,780
What, even the restroom isn't safe?!

1299
01:04:12,100 --> 01:04:15,430
So, there's no trick there

1300
01:04:15,430 --> 01:04:18,500
We have zero privacy here

1301
01:04:19,880 --> 01:04:22,590
I really need to go pee

1302
01:04:23,180 --> 01:04:25,860
We can't help but to think there's some tricks in the restroom

1303
01:04:26,540 --> 01:04:29,780
That's why we're reluctant to go

1304
01:04:33,550 --> 01:04:36,020
I made a cup of tea for you

1305
01:04:36,020 --> 01:04:38,850
You don't need to do crap like that!

1306
01:04:41,020 --> 01:04:43,490
Oh, he poured us tea?

1307
01:04:48,810 --> 01:04:50,690
What'd you think he said to you?

1308
01:04:49,860 --> 01:04:54,700
Tanaka Gets Hit With CO2 Gas

1309
01:05:02,530 --> 01:05:04,620
Tanaka~!!

1310
01:05:04,690 --> 01:05:06,130
You're too big of a wuss!

1311
01:05:06,150 --> 01:05:08,820
Who wouldn't be scared?

1312
01:05:08,820 --> 01:05:11,340
Cut me some slack

1313
01:05:11,340 --> 01:05:13,370
Close call

1314
01:05:14,120 --> 01:05:15,860
Wait, not close, I'm OUT

1315
01:05:16,340 --> 01:05:18,260
I'm sensing way more slaps than usual

1316
01:05:19,960 --> 01:05:21,270
What's up?

1317
01:05:24,950 --> 01:05:27,590
Let me pee in peace, please

1318
01:05:28,570 --> 01:05:34,440
Two Hours Have Passed

The Trainees Can Finally Relax in Their Room

1319
01:05:35,010 --> 01:05:39,680
Await the Cast!!

1320
01:05:35,010 --> 01:05:39,680
But the Infamous "Drawer Tricks"

1321
01:05:39,950 --> 01:05:41,910
We're closed for business

1322
01:05:42,280 --> 01:05:44,220
We just barely made it to the break room

1323
01:05:44,620 --> 01:05:46,990
It was just the beginning

1324
01:05:46,310 --> 01:05:48,690
From the bus ride all the way to the bathroom

1325
01:05:48,690 --> 01:05:53,360
How does "Dokaben" fit into this format anyway?

1326
01:05:48,690 --> 01:05:55,180
Dokaben

1327
01:05:55,190 --> 01:05:57,830
You've been slapped quite a bit already, Hamada-san

1328
01:05:57,020 --> 01:05:57,820
You think so?

1329
01:05:57,820 --> 01:05:59,180
I'd say you've had plenty already

1330
01:05:59,180 --> 01:06:02,230
Yeah, Downtown has gotten slapped a lot

1331
01:06:02,230 --> 01:06:05,400
But you will have the most slaps at the end for sure!!

1332
01:06:05,400 --> 01:06:09,740
I don't, I don't think soooo....

1333
01:06:07,410 --> 01:06:09,770
Sooooo??

1334
01:06:10,940 --> 01:06:12,680
He's been like this lately

1335
01:06:13,450 --> 01:06:16,930
And what's up with you punching the hell out of the urinal?

1336
01:06:17,180 --> 01:06:19,140
That was hard to watch

1337
01:06:19,810 --> 01:06:21,050
Well, that was...

1338
01:06:21,260 --> 01:06:23,380
I don't mean to sound gross but,

1339
01:06:23,380 --> 01:06:25,370
since it was cold I was wearing a lot of layers

1340
01:06:25,370 --> 01:06:28,220
And I had a hard time whipping out my junk

1341
01:06:28,220 --> 01:06:32,000
I put some muscle into yanking it out and I went "Pow!"

1342
01:06:32,020 --> 01:06:33,160
Well, let us continue then

1343
01:06:33,160 --> 01:06:34,390
Yes, let's do that

1344
01:06:34,390 --> 01:06:35,650
Matsumoto-san, please

1345
01:06:35,650 --> 01:06:36,880
Cue us in

1346
01:06:38,700 --> 01:06:42,420
WOW!!

1347
01:06:44,340 --> 01:06:48,760
It's time for the group to face an infamous prank

1348
01:06:49,570 --> 01:06:52,170
Do you think there's stuff in the desk drawers??

1349
01:06:52,170 --> 01:06:55,200
Of course there is

1350
01:07:01,410 --> 01:07:04,250
We're refusing to acknowledge the drawers, huh?

1351
01:07:04,540 --> 01:07:06,740
I say this every year...

1352
01:07:07,020 --> 01:07:09,950
I'm not required to open these drawers

1353
01:07:08,510 --> 01:07:09,710
I agree

1354
01:07:10,220 --> 01:07:12,160
Why do we have to open them?

1355
01:07:14,320 --> 01:07:16,990
Although, it's hard to ignore them

1356
01:07:18,630 --> 01:07:20,400
Screw it and open yours

1357
01:07:20,050 --> 01:07:21,080
Do I go first?

1358
01:07:21,060 --> 01:07:25,130
Endou Is the Lead-Off Hitter

1359
01:07:21,080 --> 01:07:23,170
OK then

1360
01:07:26,100 --> 01:07:28,800
What if it's one of those....

1361
01:07:27,670 --> 01:07:29,470
tricks that make you jump...

1362
01:07:29,470 --> 01:07:31,580
I need to be ready for that possibility

1363
01:07:32,960 --> 01:07:34,610
Hey, hey

1364
01:07:33,840 --> 01:07:34,950
What?

1365
01:07:39,280 --> 01:07:40,520
We caught you

1366
01:07:39,910 --> 01:07:41,980
Seriously, you need to tighten your lips

1367
01:07:43,650 --> 01:07:45,140
I'd say Tanaka's overly scared

1368
01:07:49,830 --> 01:07:50,830
Go ahead and open it

1369
01:07:51,510 --> 01:07:52,820
Tanaka, you ready?

1370
01:07:54,690 --> 01:07:55,800
Here I go

1371
01:07:56,210 --> 01:07:57,460
Let me know when you're ready

1372
01:07:57,480 --> 01:07:59,190
Here I go!

1373
01:07:59,190 --> 01:08:00,160
Endou's first drawer!

1374
01:08:00,160 --> 01:08:01,240
Don't worry

1375
01:08:02,510 --> 01:08:03,300
See?

1376
01:08:03,300 --> 01:08:07,540
Panel Found

1377
01:08:07,540 --> 01:08:09,100
You got a panel

1378
01:08:09,100 --> 01:08:10,740
So I get the panel...

1379
01:08:13,220 --> 01:08:15,420
Don't try to get out of this

1380
01:08:15,630 --> 01:08:17,340
You were gonna shove that in our faces

1381
01:08:17,760 --> 01:08:18,690
Well...

1382
01:08:18,690 --> 01:08:20,730
How about this?

1383
01:08:20,730 --> 01:08:22,490
How about...

1384
01:08:24,300 --> 01:08:26,290
Hold it like this

1385
01:08:26,290 --> 01:08:28,440
And push it up like this

1386
01:08:28,440 --> 01:08:29,730
Got that?

1387
01:08:29,730 --> 01:08:31,120
It's only fair

1388
01:08:34,450 --> 01:08:36,110
Ready?

1389
01:08:37,550 --> 01:08:38,520
Here it is

1390
01:08:47,850 --> 01:08:49,280
Who is that?

1391
01:08:53,060 --> 01:08:54,470
Is that your...

1392
01:08:53,860 --> 01:08:54,520
This isn't right

1393
01:08:54,520 --> 01:08:56,060
Who the hell is that?

1394
01:08:56,060 --> 01:08:57,830
This is so wrong

1395
01:09:00,000 --> 01:09:01,180
This isn't good

1396
01:09:01,540 --> 01:09:03,630
This needs to be put away

1397
01:09:03,630 --> 01:09:04,840
Wait a minute!

1398
01:09:04,840 --> 01:09:06,600
Let me see that!

1399
01:09:06,600 --> 01:09:08,230
No, seriously!

1400
01:09:06,770 --> 01:09:27,560
Mysterious Girl

1401
01:09:08,820 --> 01:09:10,640
Why, why, why?

1402
01:09:11,040 --> 01:09:12,660
How annoying!

1403
01:09:13,030 --> 01:09:14,280
They set me up

1404
01:09:14,280 --> 01:09:18,310
They've been hanging out a lot recently...

1405
01:09:17,710 --> 01:09:19,370
No, please listen to me

1406
01:09:19,000 --> 01:09:20,660
Where'd she take this?

1407
01:09:21,320 --> 01:09:23,820
I need to... I need to... I don't know

1408
01:09:24,070 --> 01:09:26,000
Who is this?

1409
01:09:26,590 --> 01:09:27,920
He laughing like it's nothing

1410
01:09:30,880 --> 01:09:33,250
I was expecting to see some old hag,

1411
01:09:33,800 --> 01:09:36,210
but it ended up being some random chick

1412
01:09:35,710 --> 01:09:36,450
I thought

1413
01:09:36,450 --> 01:09:38,300
"Who the hell is this?"

1414
01:09:40,570 --> 01:09:42,600
Who the hell is this?

1415
01:09:42,800 --> 01:09:44,660
So she's a...

1416
01:09:49,110 --> 01:09:50,040
This sucks

1417
01:09:50,040 --> 01:09:51,680
They couldn't have done worse really

1418
01:09:51,790 --> 01:09:53,130
One of the Gaki episode

1419
01:09:53,130 --> 01:09:57,770
involved Hamada-san pretending to be a no-show

1420
01:09:57,770 --> 01:10:01,250
but would sneak in on camera shots?

1421
01:09:59,720 --> 01:10:17,430
"Hamada is watching"

1422
01:09:59,720 --> 01:10:17,430
Aforementioned Episode

1423
01:10:01,250 --> 01:10:03,800
At that time, I was...

1424
01:10:03,800 --> 01:10:04,490
at that restaurant!?

1425
01:10:04,490 --> 01:10:07,040
Yeah, and she was working...

1426
01:10:07,040 --> 01:10:08,940
You were at the family restaurant

1427
01:10:08,940 --> 01:10:12,240
She waited my table there

1428
01:10:12,240 --> 01:10:17,270
And I straight up asked for her phone number...

1429
01:10:21,620 --> 01:10:22,970
You gotta be kidding!

1430
01:10:22,090 --> 01:10:28,780
She was the Waitress Endou Picked Up

1431
01:10:32,930 --> 01:10:34,750
You are the worst!

1432
01:10:37,100 --> 01:10:38,780
We've only been e-mailing each other thus far...

1433
01:10:38,780 --> 01:10:41,340
And never met in person

1434
01:10:41,910 --> 01:10:44,700
She actually stood me up twice

1435
01:10:45,370 --> 01:10:48,050
So why do the staff members...?

1436
01:10:46,770 --> 01:10:48,440
Why do they have this?

1437
01:10:49,340 --> 01:10:52,410
This whole thing must have been a setup by the staff members

1438
01:10:52,410 --> 01:10:54,760
From that while ago?

1439
01:10:53,290 --> 01:10:54,430
It's all clear now

1440
01:10:54,770 --> 01:10:55,770
I get it

1441
01:10:55,770 --> 01:10:56,490
My bad

1442
01:10:56,490 --> 01:10:59,920
but I sent her some really nasty e-mails...

1443
01:10:58,950 --> 01:11:00,120
No way!...

1444
01:11:00,120 --> 01:11:01,130
Let me hear it!

1445
01:11:01,130 --> 01:11:04,700
No way! There is no way I'm telling you that!

1446
01:11:04,000 --> 01:11:06,060
I don't see why WE need to be involved in this

1447
01:11:06,060 --> 01:11:07,670
and get our asses slapped

1448
01:11:08,670 --> 01:11:14,410
The kicker is I have this same pic saved in my cell phone...

1449
01:11:18,220 --> 01:11:21,240
Why were we being punished for that?

1450
01:11:21,240 --> 01:11:22,750
Yes, why?

1451
01:11:25,430 --> 01:11:28,170
The really pulled one on me there

1452
01:11:29,400 --> 01:11:31,410
They got me good

1453
01:11:30,740 --> 01:11:33,320
She looks like a chick Endou would be into

1454
01:11:33,760 --> 01:11:34,710
Amazing

1455
01:11:35,040 --> 01:11:35,940
What's crazy is

1456
01:11:35,940 --> 01:11:39,400
that is only our first drawer

1457
01:11:40,180 --> 01:11:41,580
This is horrible!

1458
01:11:41,580 --> 01:11:43,030
I'm getting freaked out...

1459
01:11:43,090 --> 01:11:45,190
about opening other drawers...

1460
01:11:45,220 --> 01:11:46,160
What if they're...

1461
01:11:46,160 --> 01:11:48,570
Well, they won't pull a same trick twice

1462
01:11:48,710 --> 01:11:50,500
Right, they're all different

1463
01:11:50,510 --> 01:11:52,590
That first drawer really got me...

1464
01:11:52,620 --> 01:11:56,900
What would you do if all of your drawers were like the first one?

1465
01:11:57,280 --> 01:11:59,440
Ka, ke, key...

1466
01:11:59,680 --> 01:12:01,120
What the heck?

1467
01:12:06,610 --> 01:12:09,240
I kept telling myself that the drawer was locked...

1468
01:12:09,740 --> 01:12:11,580
That was your fault!!

1469
01:12:11,580 --> 01:12:13,580
And NOT MINE!!!!

1470
01:12:18,960 --> 01:12:20,250
From now on, how about

1471
01:12:20,300 --> 01:12:24,110
only YOU get slapped if you can't spit out a word or two?

1472
01:12:25,100 --> 01:12:27,120
Nothing there

1473
01:12:26,170 --> 01:12:27,170
Nothing?

1474
01:12:31,310 --> 01:12:38,290
Candy Found

1475
01:12:31,590 --> 01:12:34,270
What's this?

1476
01:12:34,270 --> 01:12:35,890
Candy?

1477
01:12:35,890 --> 01:12:37,790
Just regular candy

1478
01:12:40,080 --> 01:12:41,310
Alright then...

1479
01:12:41,310 --> 01:12:43,310
Alright, after this, I'm done

1480
01:12:45,220 --> 01:12:46,780
There wasn't anything else

1481
01:12:47,510 --> 01:12:49,240
I'm done

1482
01:12:50,310 --> 01:12:52,240
Should we do this in order?

1483
01:12:52,370 --> 01:12:54,160
Any order is good with me...

1484
01:12:54,860 --> 01:12:56,580
This is really nerve wrecking

1485
01:12:56,930 --> 01:12:58,630
Should I go then?

1486
01:12:58,630 --> 01:13:00,810
Are you OK with sitting like that?

1487
01:13:00,810 --> 01:13:02,810
In case it explodes or something?

1488
01:13:02,810 --> 01:13:05,000
The drawer is too "narrow" to setup like that

1489
01:13:05,000 --> 01:13:07,000
Narrow?

1490
01:13:09,520 --> 01:13:10,860
What do you mean by "Narrow"?

1491
01:13:10,860 --> 01:13:13,710
Um, this...

1492
01:13:11,870 --> 01:13:13,710
You mean "Thinness?"

1493
01:13:15,170 --> 01:13:18,180
That was dumb... just dumb

1494
01:13:19,580 --> 01:13:22,090
Would you give me a break!?

1495
01:13:22,090 --> 01:13:24,230
What's with "Narrow" talk?

1496
01:13:24,610 --> 01:13:27,180
You got me in this, too

1497
01:13:28,300 --> 01:13:32,100
He's right, that drawer is thin

1498
01:13:30,300 --> 01:13:32,040
And not "Narrow"

1499
01:13:32,990 --> 01:13:34,550
Oh! I was spared!

1500
01:13:34,890 --> 01:13:37,010
Tanaka was spared just now

1501
01:13:37,400 --> 01:13:38,800
Ah, nothing is in there...

1502
01:13:38,800 --> 01:13:40,800
Nothing there

1503
01:13:42,100 --> 01:13:45,230
Take out the whole drawer, why don't you?!

1504
01:13:45,900 --> 01:13:47,910
You don't have to open it that far

1505
01:13:49,670 --> 01:13:59,430
Hamada Action Figure

1506
01:13:52,870 --> 01:13:54,480
This haunted us later

1507
01:14:01,260 --> 01:14:02,990
What in the hell...?

1508
01:14:02,990 --> 01:14:05,350
That's just straight up hilarious!

1509
01:14:10,070 --> 01:14:10,830
What is this?

1510
01:14:14,000 --> 01:14:14,960
Amazing

1511
01:14:14,960 --> 01:14:27,210
Hamada Action Figure

1512
01:14:23,120 --> 01:14:24,600
The resemblance is uncanny

1513
01:14:24,620 --> 01:14:26,750
This was very well crafted

1514
01:14:27,760 --> 01:14:29,490
It had the perfect physique

1515
01:14:31,620 --> 01:14:32,900
We can't stand him up though

1516
01:14:32,900 --> 01:14:34,700
You can just have him sit?

1517
01:14:34,440 --> 01:14:36,040
That is just...

1518
01:14:37,310 --> 01:14:38,550
He looks just like him

1519
01:14:38,660 --> 01:14:39,850
Don't stare at it

1520
01:14:39,850 --> 01:14:42,020
It's hazardous!!

1521
01:14:45,930 --> 01:14:47,760
Hazardous to our health

1522
01:14:48,760 --> 01:14:50,070
Just like him

1523
01:14:51,490 --> 01:15:01,080
Packed Panties

1524
01:14:57,440 --> 01:14:58,980
How much is in there?

1525
01:14:59,780 --> 01:15:01,160
It's packed

1526
01:15:01,160 --> 01:15:02,950
How anally retentive

1527
01:15:07,010 --> 01:15:08,200
Very packed

1528
01:15:10,630 --> 01:15:12,120
Super packed

1529
01:15:14,430 --> 01:15:16,560
Nothing is found at the bottom drawer

1530
01:15:21,590 --> 01:15:23,150
Matsumoto-san, how about it?

1531
01:15:23,510 --> 01:15:24,410
Someone else?

1532
01:15:24,410 --> 01:15:26,010
Can I go then?

1533
01:15:26,220 --> 01:15:28,710
Look what he's up to

1534
01:15:31,040 --> 01:15:32,310
That's an unfair angel

1535
01:15:32,310 --> 01:15:33,480
I'm going then

1536
01:15:34,850 --> 01:15:35,730
Yama-chan, you're up?

1537
01:15:39,990 --> 01:15:41,690
Nada

1538
01:15:41,980 --> 01:15:42,870
Nothing?

1539
01:15:46,690 --> 01:15:49,840
A Rock Found

1540
01:15:54,780 --> 01:15:56,560
What's this?

1541
01:16:03,350 --> 01:16:04,300
HOT!!

1542
01:16:04,810 --> 01:16:08,660
Rock is Burning Hot

1543
01:16:11,570 --> 01:16:13,180
Who would've thought?

1544
01:16:13,180 --> 01:16:14,500
You better not be lying!

1545
01:16:15,480 --> 01:16:16,860
I had no idea

1546
01:16:21,170 --> 01:16:23,330
Are you serious?

1547
01:16:26,850 --> 01:16:28,540
It's really hot?

1548
01:16:28,540 --> 01:16:30,240
It's really hot

1549
01:16:30,370 --> 01:16:31,710
Wow

1550
01:16:31,880 --> 01:16:33,730
How evil is this?

1551
01:16:33,730 --> 01:16:36,830
You would have been toast had you grabbed that any sooner

1552
01:16:39,320 --> 01:16:40,860
Nothing

1553
01:16:41,360 --> 01:16:43,090
I see something

1554
01:16:43,090 --> 01:16:44,260
Yes, there's something in there

1555
01:16:50,520 --> 01:16:56,050
Trash

1556
01:16:56,860 --> 01:16:59,380
Seriously, did we figure out what this was?

1557
01:16:59,400 --> 01:17:01,880
It was just a trash

1558
01:17:02,270 --> 01:17:04,740
They're screwing with you

1559
01:17:05,560 --> 01:17:07,270
What was that all about?

1560
01:17:07,840 --> 01:17:10,610
This is nothing more than a trash

1561
01:17:12,250 --> 01:17:13,850
So this is how they see us

1562
01:17:14,080 --> 01:17:16,140
I'm finished

1563
01:17:17,920 --> 01:17:19,850
Tanaka-san, you're ready?

1564
01:17:19,850 --> 01:17:22,730
I suppose it is my turn

1565
01:17:26,140 --> 01:17:28,170
Is this gonna make us jump?

1566
01:17:28,170 --> 01:17:31,030
I'm afraid of the sudden loud noise

1567
01:17:34,430 --> 01:17:37,310
Tanaka, you're such a wuss

1568
01:17:37,080 --> 01:17:40,750
Envelope Found

1569
01:17:42,780 --> 01:17:46,770
The staff have been onto you for a while, huh Endo?

1570
01:17:46,770 --> 01:17:49,690
If I can only reveal what kind of emails I have been...

1571
01:17:49,810 --> 01:17:51,650
I wish you'd tell us

1572
01:17:51,650 --> 01:17:53,370
I can't reveal that

1573
01:17:54,900 --> 01:17:56,250
Here we go

1574
01:17:57,190 --> 01:18:03,230
Mysterious DVD

1575
01:18:03,200 --> 01:18:03,890
Here's one

1576
01:18:03,940 --> 01:18:04,520
Two

1577
01:18:04,600 --> 01:18:05,370
and three

1578
01:18:05,420 --> 01:18:06,670
Why so many?

1579
01:18:07,870 --> 01:18:10,130
Why don't we come back to that later

1580
01:18:10,580 --> 01:18:12,240
First thing first

1581
01:18:15,460 --> 01:18:17,210
You have more?

1582
01:18:16,710 --> 01:18:22,140
Another Envelope Found

1583
01:18:17,330 --> 01:18:18,050
You're kiddin'

1584
01:18:18,630 --> 01:18:20,110
DVD?

1585
01:18:20,110 --> 01:18:22,000
We get more?

1586
01:18:29,620 --> 01:18:33,460
Prank Envelope

1587
01:18:35,740 --> 01:18:36,610
What was that?

1588
01:18:37,650 --> 01:18:39,320
It's a prank

1589
01:18:39,420 --> 01:18:41,280
Like that rattlesnake prank envelope?

1590
01:18:41,280 --> 01:18:42,760
Here it is

1591
01:18:46,980 --> 01:18:50,850
Only you would fall for that

1592
01:18:51,770 --> 01:18:54,250
Drawer was set up perfectly

1593
01:18:59,170 --> 01:19:00,470
Nothing here

1594
01:19:02,880 --> 01:19:05,640
Nothing here either

1595
01:19:05,640 --> 01:19:06,780
So you get the set of DVD's

1596
01:19:07,600 --> 01:19:08,600
What now?

1597
01:19:09,530 --> 01:19:11,160
Matsumoto-san?

1598
01:19:11,160 --> 01:19:14,300
I really don't wanna do this

1599
01:19:19,710 --> 01:19:21,960
Can I open it?

1600
01:19:27,180 --> 01:19:29,980
I really don't wanna do this

1601
01:19:35,180 --> 01:19:37,510
Can I open it?

1602
01:19:38,690 --> 01:19:39,670
Go for it

1603
01:19:39,910 --> 01:19:42,260
Will you tell him to cut it out?

1604
01:19:52,010 --> 01:19:53,240
Nothing in here

1605
01:19:58,850 --> 01:20:00,850
I have a feeling something's in here

1606
01:20:00,860 --> 01:20:02,120
What the??

1607
01:20:03,290 --> 01:20:08,230
Red Ink on Drawer

1608
01:20:09,360 --> 01:20:11,070
Such a childish prank!

1609
01:20:18,870 --> 01:20:20,470
That was pointless

1610
01:20:20,470 --> 01:20:22,180
Yeah, it was

1611
01:20:22,180 --> 01:20:23,580
Really pointless

1612
01:20:26,310 --> 01:20:27,280
Nothing

1613
01:20:27,280 --> 01:20:31,220
Give him a tissue..a wet one

1614
01:20:36,720 --> 01:20:38,330
So irritating

1615
01:20:37,890 --> 01:20:39,360
What is this....

1616
01:20:39,430 --> 01:20:41,160
a microphone?

1617
01:20:47,740 --> 01:20:52,470
Wet Tissue Explosion

1618
01:20:47,900 --> 01:20:49,540
That was dangerous!

1619
01:20:53,870 --> 01:20:56,110
Give me a break

1620
01:20:56,810 --> 01:20:58,080
That was super scary!

1621
01:20:58,650 --> 01:21:00,350
That scared the hell outta me!

1622
01:21:00,380 --> 01:21:01,920
So scary!

1623
01:21:06,350 --> 01:21:09,620
They knew we would use it to wipe off the ink

1624
01:21:09,620 --> 01:21:11,630
I see

1625
01:21:09,620 --> 01:21:11,630
Yeah, that's right!

1626
01:21:12,390 --> 01:21:13,830
This should be OK

1627
01:21:17,460 --> 01:21:18,450
What was that...?

1628
01:21:18,450 --> 01:21:20,870
It wasn't even intended to make us laugh

1629
01:21:24,640 --> 01:21:26,570
Why are you laughing?

1630
01:21:26,640 --> 01:21:27,890
I'm not

1631
01:21:28,040 --> 01:21:29,970
You're doing nothing but laughing

1632
01:21:30,030 --> 01:21:31,280
I'm not

1633
01:21:31,450 --> 01:21:33,910
Why is it so strict today?

1634
01:21:34,950 --> 01:21:36,780
Yeah, it is this year

1635
01:21:37,650 --> 01:21:39,680
What about Endou's candy?

1636
01:21:39,680 --> 01:21:41,340
Yeah, what's up with that?

1637
01:21:43,410 --> 01:21:45,310
Gotta be something to it

1638
01:21:45,470 --> 01:21:48,000
It's labeled as "Magic Candy"

1639
01:21:56,040 --> 01:21:56,770
Why not open it?

1640
01:21:58,070 --> 01:21:59,510
Let's eat it

1641
01:21:59,510 --> 01:22:01,510
Really?

1642
01:22:00,330 --> 01:22:00,880
ZAP!

1643
01:22:05,150 --> 01:22:09,420
Electric Shock Candy

1644
01:22:06,650 --> 01:22:08,080
That was so painful

1645
01:22:11,520 --> 01:22:12,990
Wait a...

1646
01:22:13,620 --> 01:22:16,160
They're not trying to make us laugh this year

1647
01:22:16,190 --> 01:22:17,090
The pranks are painful

1648
01:22:17,090 --> 01:22:18,010
and scary

1649
01:22:20,390 --> 01:22:21,660
It zapped you?

1650
01:22:24,160 --> 01:22:27,770
I felt the strong current going up my arm

1651
01:22:28,740 --> 01:22:30,440
This is awful..

1652
01:22:31,470 --> 01:22:34,140
I wonder if the DVD prank is the same as last year?

1653
01:22:34,140 --> 01:22:37,790
Yamasaki OUT angel~

1654
01:22:34,140 --> 01:22:43,850
*"OUT" was hidden in the lyrics

1655
01:22:34,140 --> 01:22:43,850
Last Year

1656
01:22:37,790 --> 01:22:43,870
Tanaka 2-Slaps Angel~

1657
01:22:44,490 --> 01:22:47,620
Yeah, I never expected...

1658
01:22:47,720 --> 01:22:53,360
Endou Still Can't Get Her Out of His Head

1659
01:22:49,520 --> 01:22:51,160
So, was she a customer?

1660
01:22:51,160 --> 01:22:53,690
No, she was a shop employee

1661
01:22:54,290 --> 01:22:58,260
It was a shock.. really...

1662
01:23:05,440 --> 01:23:07,880
I didn't notice you were doing that

1663
01:23:07,880 --> 01:23:12,210
Well.. it really wasn't hurting us

1664
01:23:12,320 --> 01:23:14,950
Now I know why she didn't respond

1665
01:23:15,720 --> 01:23:16,850
Because...

1666
01:23:23,060 --> 01:23:31,730
she said she was at the hospital...with some kind of heart disease or something...

1667
01:23:32,500 --> 01:23:34,170
on the day we were going to see...

1668
01:23:34,170 --> 01:23:36,540
That's enough, you're taking too long

1669
01:23:42,880 --> 01:23:44,630
How come he's laughing that much and...

1670
01:23:44,690 --> 01:23:46,350
I'd say I'm 100% safe

1671
01:23:46,410 --> 01:23:47,580
Why is that?

1672
01:23:47,580 --> 01:23:50,280
Looks like he was laughing at a comedy show

1673
01:23:56,160 --> 01:23:58,590
Yama-chan should get two hits

1674
01:24:07,790 --> 01:24:09,510
Look at my dusty pants

1675
01:24:11,540 --> 01:24:13,970
Wanna try watching a DVD?

1676
01:24:14,170 --> 01:24:16,210
Yeah, the DVD's

1677
01:24:16,640 --> 01:24:18,680
There's a total of three?

1678
01:24:23,630 --> 01:24:26,020
We can't just leave them there...

1679
01:24:31,230 --> 01:24:33,960
Why do you have that look on your face?

1680
01:24:34,180 --> 01:24:36,800
We still don't know if Tanaka will be out

1681
01:24:39,830 --> 01:24:42,540
It might be an instructional DVD for the GIA

1682
01:24:42,540 --> 01:24:44,400
Yes, that's true

1683
01:24:44,400 --> 01:24:47,880
Sorry, I had a flashback from last year

1684
01:24:48,010 --> 01:24:49,410
Let's watch it then!!

1685
01:24:49,440 --> 01:24:50,650
Yeah

1686
01:24:51,450 --> 01:24:52,710
I wonder what's on it

1687
01:24:54,680 --> 01:24:56,950
Yama-chan, it was in your desk last year, right?

1688
01:24:57,050 --> 01:24:57,900
Yes

1689
01:24:57,630 --> 01:24:58,400
Right?

1690
01:24:58,400 --> 01:24:59,430
That's right

1691
01:24:59,020 --> 01:25:03,560
Just because you find the DVD doesn't mean you'll get an "OUT"

1692
01:25:01,120 --> 01:25:03,160
Yes, that's true

Three great plays,

1714

and the benches clear out during a brawl!?

1715
01:25:27,800 --> 01:25:32,090
We finally see ace Yamada after a year and five months

1716
01:25:27,800 --> 01:25:34,940
Liars

1717
01:25:32,770 --> 01:25:36,040
GIA's Yamasaki in the white uniform

1718
01:25:35,920 --> 01:25:37,190
What kind of spy is that?

1719
01:25:38,790 --> 01:25:42,660
It was a perfect pitch but the 3rd baseman overthrew the ball

1720
01:25:43,930 --> 01:25:46,600
Their defense made crucial errors

1721
01:25:47,940 --> 01:25:49,500
Next up was Matsumoto

1722
01:25:50,300 --> 01:25:53,710
Hamada connects again as Yamada struggles with his pitching

1723
01:25:57,040 --> 01:25:59,780
No outs and bases are loaded

1724
01:26:01,850 --> 01:26:06,590
The clean up hitter is Endou, and he's averaging .300

1725
01:26:07,090 --> 01:26:08,260
First pitch

1726
01:26:10,860 --> 01:26:16,100
Endou hits a weak slider to left center for an RBI

1727
01:26:17,200 --> 01:26:21,640
Endou sees his chance and tries for home plate

1728
01:26:23,400 --> 01:26:25,110
But gets called out

1729
01:26:25,440 --> 01:26:27,980
An argument erupts

1730
01:26:29,110 --> 01:26:30,540
What kind of call was that?

1731
01:26:30,540 --> 01:26:31,420
No way he tagged me

1732
01:26:31,420 --> 01:26:32,550
He was clearly safe

1733
01:26:32,550 --> 01:26:34,610
And that got Coach Tanaka going

1734
01:26:35,450 --> 01:26:36,620
He was safe!

1735
01:26:36,850 --> 01:26:38,650
Tanaka ejected!

1736
01:26:39,250 --> 01:26:40,890
Thai kick!!

1737
01:26:40,890 --> 01:26:44,490
Tanaka gets thrown out and will receive a Thai Kick

1738
01:26:45,760 --> 01:26:48,530
The GIA don't give up

1739
01:26:48,530 --> 01:26:51,030
But the catcher didn't tag him

1740
01:26:51,030 --> 01:26:53,130
Endou and Hamada start to complain

1741
01:26:52,770 --> 01:26:54,900
No, don't get involved

1742
01:26:55,170 --> 01:26:58,470
Next, Yamasaki starts to heat things up

1743
01:26:58,860 --> 01:27:00,450
Where the hell were you looking?

1744
01:27:00,240 --> 01:27:01,540
No, stop talking

1745
01:27:01,540 --> 01:27:03,540
Yamasaki ejected!

1746
01:27:03,840 --> 01:27:04,680
Thai kick!!

1747
01:27:05,880 --> 01:27:08,350
Both players from GIA will receive a Thai kick

1748
01:27:08,350 --> 01:27:10,350
And they also lost the game

1749
01:27:18,890 --> 01:27:20,260
No way!!

1750
01:27:20,660 --> 01:27:26,930
Thai Kick Punishment to the Named Players

1751
01:27:28,300 --> 01:27:30,500
This is ridiculous!

1752
01:27:30,510 --> 01:27:32,470
Well, the show must go on

1753
01:27:32,470 --> 01:27:33,840
Why?

1754
01:27:34,110 --> 01:27:35,680
Why?

1755
01:27:36,430 --> 01:27:39,780
It doesn't make sense that I have to be Thai kicked!!

1756
01:27:39,980 --> 01:27:42,250
Stay put or you'll get really hurt

1757
01:27:43,040 --> 01:27:43,850
Move forward

1758
01:27:43,850 --> 01:27:44,760
Move up

1759
01:27:45,640 --> 01:27:46,250
Why?

1760
01:27:47,090 --> 01:27:49,190
Hurry up

1761
01:27:47,720 --> 01:27:49,190
Hurry up

1762
01:27:49,190 --> 01:27:50,190
This can't be

1763
01:27:50,240 --> 01:27:51,370
Stay calm

1764
01:27:51,690 --> 01:27:52,430
This can't be

1765
01:27:54,790 --> 01:27:55,800
No, please

1766
01:27:55,800 --> 01:27:56,660
THAT'S ENOUGH

1767
01:27:56,260 --> 01:27:58,400
That's super painful

1768
01:28:09,750 --> 01:28:11,520
I only smiled... slightly...

1769
01:28:11,550 --> 01:28:13,820
Yeah, he did

1770
01:28:16,820 --> 01:28:18,180
He smiled, he smiled

1771
01:28:17,810 --> 01:28:22,290
That must've really hurt... this DVD is scary

1772
01:28:23,100 --> 01:28:24,320
Take it out

1773
01:28:26,490 --> 01:28:30,430
Thai kicks are the worst

1774
01:28:31,200 --> 01:28:33,770
I wasn't expecting the Thai kick...

1775
01:28:37,070 --> 01:28:40,970
C'mon, can't you stop playing with the doll?

1776
01:28:43,430 --> 01:28:45,680
Can you stop turning the head in different directions

1777
01:28:45,680 --> 01:28:47,680
You're using it as a weapon

1778
01:29:08,740 --> 01:29:10,800
Excuse me but I have to...

1779
01:29:12,370 --> 01:29:14,310
That's not a natural position

1780
01:29:18,110 --> 01:29:19,650
Confiscate that!

1781
01:29:19,650 --> 01:29:21,010
Yes, we should

1782
01:29:21,010 --> 01:29:23,020
Take it away

1783
01:29:23,020 --> 01:29:25,120
Please, I'm confiscating this

1784
01:29:25,120 --> 01:29:26,120
Let me have it

1785
01:29:26,290 --> 01:29:27,850
OK, here

1786
01:30:22,810 --> 01:30:23,840
Why you....

1787
01:30:24,220 --> 01:30:25,580
Why do you do that?

1788
01:31:07,230 --> 01:31:09,550
This was tough not to laugh

1789
01:31:09,550 --> 01:31:11,990
What a pain!

1790
01:31:46,870 --> 01:31:49,250
You're playing dirty now!

1791
01:31:50,130 --> 01:31:52,570
What the hell are you doing?!

1792
01:31:53,600 --> 01:31:54,910
That needs to be confiscated

1793
01:31:59,340 --> 01:32:01,710
Confiscate that, please

1794
01:32:01,940 --> 01:32:05,210
I wish I had that weapon in my hand

1795
01:32:06,510 --> 01:32:08,580
One trick after the other,

1796
01:32:08,580 --> 01:32:11,760
The trickery will not stop

1797
01:32:12,940 --> 01:32:13,930
Listen up

1798
01:32:14,450 --> 01:32:18,890

Secret Agent ~?

1801
01:32:34,460 --> 01:32:38,100
You'd make us stand out in this cold?

1802
01:32:39,090 --> 01:32:40,900
Man, I hate the outside

1803
01:32:40,910 --> 01:32:44,230
They made such a big deal about the "security,"

1804
01:32:44,230 --> 01:32:46,410
but look at this door being wide freakin' open

1805
01:32:54,590 --> 01:32:58,670

Thanks for joining us for the GIA morning meeting

1816
01:33:22,090 --> 01:33:27,660
Our guest is a GIA chief commander from Holland branch

1817
01:33:27,660 --> 01:33:29,360
Let me introduce him to you all

1818
01:33:35,970 --> 01:33:38,470

1819
01:33:38,470 --> 01:33:40,060

I´m most flattered to be here with you.

1821
01:33:40,870 --> 01:33:45,810
Greetings in Dutch

1822
01:33:44,370 --> 01:33:47,400
I have come to Japan and Japan is such a beautiful country

1823
01:33:47,400 --> 01:33:49,400
I have enjoyed such a nice meal yesterday

1824
01:33:49,400 --> 01:33:51,740
I actually want to ask myself....

1825
01:33:51,740 --> 01:33:53,550
What do I want to say more...

1826
01:33:55,360 --> 01:33:58,690
ARE YOU LISTING!!!

1827
01:33:58,690 --> 01:34:01,160
YOU ARE SLEEPING!

1828
01:34:01,530 --> 01:34:04,130
WHAT ARE YOU DOING HERE!

1829
01:34:05,090 --> 01:34:08,290
Did you choose the wrong job?

1830
01:34:14,940 --> 01:34:16,480
He's pissed at you, Tanaka

1831
01:34:16,480 --> 01:34:18,510
What, me?

1832
01:34:17,210 --> 01:34:18,710
BIIIGGG LONGGG MISTER!!

BIIIGGG LONGGG MISTER!!

You have chosen the wrong job!

1836
01:34:22,180 --> 01:34:26,320
Tanaka evokes anger

1837
01:34:29,960 --> 01:34:32,160
I was scared for him

1838
01:34:33,650 --> 01:34:34,830
I didn't do anything...

1839
01:34:36,370 --> 01:34:38,870
WINDOW CLEANER!!

1840
01:34:38,070 --> 01:34:42,100
He wouldn't be that pissed off for nothing

1841
01:34:48,380 --> 01:34:50,440
Seriously, he had my full attention

1842
01:34:54,750 --> 01:34:56,880
NOT ENOUGH!! AGAIN!!!

1843
01:34:56,880 --> 01:34:59,190
NOT ENOUGH!! AGAIN!!!

1844
01:35:00,220 --> 01:35:02,360

YOU ARE TALL...

01:35:05,430 --> 01:35:07,530
YOUR TIE IS WRONG!!!

1847

WHAT ARE YOU SUPPOSED TO DO HERE!!!!

1848
01:35:10,100 --> 01:35:11,970
YOU HAVE SEARCHED FOR THE WRONG JOB!!!

1849

BRAAWWAAAAAHH

1853
01:35:20,010 --> 01:35:22,180
Tanaka, you really need to apologize

1854
01:35:23,510 --> 01:35:25,380
Say you're sorry!

1855
01:35:29,120 --> 01:35:32,390
Apologize to him anyway
He's really pissed off

1856
01:35:33,050 --> 01:35:35,190
WHAT ARE YOU GONNA DO!!!

1857
01:35:35,190 --> 01:35:35,660
THIS ISN´T GOING WELL!!!

1858
01:35:35,660 --> 01:35:36,360
THIS ISN´T GOING WELL!!!

1859
01:35:36,360 --> 01:35:37,620
THIS ISN´T GOING WELL!!!

1860
01:35:36,990 --> 01:35:39,490
I'm sorry

1861
01:35:37,720 --> 01:35:39,490
I´M GONNA GET YOU!!!

1862
01:35:39,530 --> 01:35:41,290
OK?!

1863
01:35:40,510 --> 01:35:42,600
I'm sorry about that

1864
01:35:52,970 --> 01:35:55,980
Chief "Vents" Kick

1865
01:35:59,880 --> 01:36:02,880
He's got nothing to do with this

1866
01:36:08,680 --> 01:36:10,090
Thank you very much

1867
01:36:10,100 --> 01:36:14,660
One of us has received an Excellence Citation

1868
01:36:14,790 --> 01:36:17,800
He's made our occupation "cool"

1869
01:36:21,070 --> 01:36:27,540
Limosine Arrives

1870
01:36:29,440 --> 01:36:33,080
One of us has received an Excellence Citation

1871
01:36:33,150 --> 01:36:36,150
He's made our occupation "cool"

1872
01:36:39,390 --> 01:36:45,730
Limosine Arrives

1873
01:37:00,510 --> 01:37:03,710
Arthur Kuroda

1874
01:37:00,510 --> 01:37:03,710
Too hot for a Spy

1875
01:37:06,680 --> 01:37:10,980
How are you all doing today?

1876
01:37:10,980 --> 01:37:15,360
Who's going to be my hostage tonight?

1877
01:37:17,490 --> 01:37:21,830
Too Hot for White Tighty

1878
01:37:30,500 --> 01:37:32,530
Don't hit the back thigh

1879
01:37:34,910 --> 01:37:37,140
I love you~!

1880
01:37:39,880 --> 01:37:43,720
With that, the meeting is adjourned

1881
01:37:45,100 --> 01:37:45,910
Ready?

1882
01:37:52,270 --> 01:37:54,230
Five hours has passed

1883
01:37:55,000 --> 01:37:58,810
A situation turns mysterious as Fujiwara makes a suggestion

1884
01:37:58,810 --> 01:38:01,300
I just caught you laughing

1885
01:38:01,490 --> 01:38:03,190
Let's get it right

1886
01:38:03,190 --> 01:38:04,420
Right, a fair game

1887
01:38:05,270 --> 01:38:07,010
Let's do some stretches

1888
01:38:07,010 --> 01:38:09,140
Why don't you stand up?

1889
01:38:09,340 --> 01:38:15,950
Contrived Stretching

1890
01:38:09,450 --> 01:38:10,680
We need to exercise

1891
01:38:10,680 --> 01:38:12,710
We can do this on our own

1892
01:38:12,710 --> 01:38:14,640
Well, let's do this together

1893
01:38:16,330 --> 01:38:19,280
First, pull your arms up like this

1894
01:38:19,280 --> 01:38:21,240
My back hurts

1895
01:38:21,240 --> 01:38:24,150
And move side to side

1896
01:38:24,150 --> 01:38:27,460
Now lean forward...

1897
01:38:26,090 --> 01:38:27,430
BBBBang!

1898
01:38:27,690 --> 01:38:29,300
BBBBBBang!!

1899
01:38:33,750 --> 01:38:34,910
What the....!?

1900
01:38:40,740 --> 01:38:42,020
Now lean forward...

1901
01:38:41,510 --> 01:38:42,840
BBBang!

1902
01:38:43,110 --> 01:38:44,710
BBBBBang!!

1903
01:38:49,230 --> 01:38:50,870
What the hell...?!!

1904
01:38:51,950 --> 01:38:53,990
I heard some noise

1905
01:38:53,990 --> 01:38:54,990
But that was nothing

1906
01:38:56,490 --> 01:38:57,720
What's wrong with you guys?

1907
01:38:59,720 --> 01:39:02,410
Freaky...

1908
01:39:02,410 --> 01:39:04,050
You scared me

1909
01:39:04,100 --> 01:39:06,120
Hamada, your shoulder must be stiff

1910
01:39:06,230 --> 01:39:06,900
Well...

1911
01:39:07,050 --> 01:39:07,990
I'll give it a good rub

1912
01:39:07,990 --> 01:39:10,080
No, you don't have to...

1913
01:39:10,080 --> 01:39:12,620
You've always suffered from stiff shoulders

1914
01:39:14,750 --> 01:39:17,390
See?

1915
01:39:15,190 --> 01:39:16,340
How scary is that?

1916
01:39:23,420 --> 01:39:25,420
What, you've seen ghost or something??

1917
01:39:27,150 --> 01:39:28,650
Don't be so down

1918
01:39:29,390 --> 01:39:30,160
I know..

1919
01:39:30,780 --> 01:39:32,120
You got taller all of a sudden...

1920
01:39:33,990 --> 01:39:38,800
That voice is none other than (Itao)

1921
01:39:38,830 --> 01:39:43,840
You know, your reputation has gone sour these days

1922
01:39:44,680 --> 01:39:45,490
Is that so?

1923
01:39:45,000 --> 01:39:48,070
That's right, your coworkers are sharing the same sentiment

1924
01:39:48,640 --> 01:39:55,310
Downtown needs to do a live concert as a unit

1925
01:39:56,520 --> 01:39:58,920
Won't you guys do a live performance?

1926
01:39:58,920 --> 01:40:01,350
as Downtown...

1927
01:40:01,940 --> 01:40:04,390
We'll give it some....consideration

1928
01:40:04,390 --> 01:40:06,690
Yeah, let's get it together

1929
01:40:07,360 --> 01:40:08,670
What's with you guys?

1930
01:40:08,800 --> 01:40:13,110
You've seen a ghost or something?

1931
01:40:13,100 --> 01:40:15,200
How many times is he going to say that?

1932
01:40:16,250 --> 01:40:18,590
I don't get what's going on here

1933
01:40:19,210 --> 01:40:20,250
He's freaking me out

1934
01:40:20,310 --> 01:40:21,610
It's amazing how scary he is!!

1935
01:40:24,960 --> 01:40:26,200
That was a good hit

1936
01:40:26,200 --> 01:40:27,920
Don't hold back

1937
01:40:29,780 --> 01:40:31,750
Which celebrity's underwear do you want to see?

1938
01:40:31,750 --> 01:40:33,900
Which celebrity's underwear do you want to see?

1939
01:40:34,350 --> 01:40:36,120
Who wants to start?

1940
01:40:36,560 --> 01:40:38,100
There's gotta be someone

1941
01:40:38,180 --> 01:40:39,390
At least one...

1942
01:40:47,430 --> 01:40:50,660
The real Fujiwara isn't like this

1943
01:40:50,940 --> 01:40:53,170
Fujiwara-san, you're a bit creepy

1944
01:40:56,980 --> 01:40:58,670
There's nothing creepy about me

1945
01:40:58,780 --> 01:41:00,760
I'm just Fujiwara after all...

1946
01:41:00,940 --> 01:41:02,630
My weight is killing my back

1947
01:41:06,480 --> 01:41:09,720
You haven't noticed yet, have you?

1948
01:41:10,020 --> 01:41:12,530
This guy has been impersonating me

1949
01:41:12,790 --> 01:41:15,930
He's a master of disguise

1950
01:41:18,600 --> 01:41:20,530
Were you fooled!? Members!

1951
01:41:20,530 --> 01:41:23,600
Were you fooled!? Members!

1952
01:41:21,790 --> 01:41:22,740
Members?

1953
01:41:25,810 --> 01:41:31,310
Itao Itsuji

1954
01:41:25,810 --> 01:41:31,310
Master of Disguise

1955
01:41:30,850 --> 01:41:32,550
What're you saying?

1956
01:41:32,550 --> 01:41:34,380
He said "Members!"

1957
01:41:35,620 --> 01:41:37,580
So that's what you're going to call us?

1958
01:41:46,830 --> 01:41:48,330
Did you think I was Fujiwara?

1959
01:41:48,660 --> 01:41:53,800
Wouldn't it be great if ... everyone here


could become a professional like him?

1960
01:41:54,360 --> 01:41:56,480
Let's go

1961
01:41:57,700 --> 01:41:59,140
But we knew the entire time...

1962
01:41:59,330 --> 01:42:01,510
Yeah, we knew about it

1963
01:42:01,680 --> 01:42:03,610
The biggest giveaway was Itao's legs

1964
01:42:03,690 --> 01:42:06,040
with the stockings

1965
01:42:06,040 --> 01:42:08,410
He's got unique looking legs

1966
01:42:08,850 --> 01:42:11,350
That bow-legged stance and all...

1967
01:42:15,760 --> 01:42:18,260
Tanaka, hurry up and put in the next DVD

1968
01:42:18,590 --> 01:42:20,930
Should we take a a look?

1969
01:42:19,950 --> 01:42:21,290
We're gonna watch it sooner or later

1970
01:42:21,290 --> 01:42:24,250
It would be nice to get them all out of the way...

1971
01:42:22,800 --> 01:42:24,250
Yeah, that's a good point...

1972
01:42:24,870 --> 01:42:27,570
Maybe it won't be me this time...

1973
01:42:27,570 --> 01:42:30,010
I might not have a part in this either...

1974
01:42:31,960 --> 01:42:35,210
However it goes, it won't be good for any of us

1975
01:42:35,210 --> 01:42:38,220
Somehow we always get dragged into it...

1976
01:42:44,520 --> 01:42:49,730
Kimi no Hitomi ni Ryouomoi

1977
01:42:44,530 --> 01:42:49,730
(Love in Your Eyes)

1978
01:42:50,900 --> 01:42:55,260
Announcing the Suga HS Basketball Club's 10 year reunion

1979
01:42:55,880 --> 01:42:58,050
Cheers!

1980
01:43:07,660 --> 01:43:10,180
Even after all this time, nothing has really changed

1981
01:43:10,180 --> 01:43:11,060
Especially you, Ritsuko

1982
01:43:11,110 --> 01:43:13,080
You're still maintaining your beauty

1983
01:43:13,080 --> 01:43:14,700
Thanks, but keep trying

1984
01:43:14,700 --> 01:43:17,720
Are you saying I failed to maintain my beauty?

1985
01:43:17,720 --> 01:43:20,240
Not at all! You look lovely in that red dress

1986
01:43:20,240 --> 01:43:22,240
You're the only one who can get away with wearing that dress

1987
01:43:22,240 --> 01:43:24,260
You've really done it now!

1988
01:43:25,710 --> 01:43:27,280
Just like old times...

1989
01:43:28,110 --> 01:43:29,290
Yeah...

1990
01:43:29,290 --> 01:43:32,140
Hosaka, who are you married to?

1991
01:43:32,140 --> 01:43:33,770
One of my coworkers

1992
01:43:34,220 --> 01:43:36,490
Speaking of which, you should get married!

1993
01:43:36,500 --> 01:43:39,400
You're giving Captain a bad name

1994
01:43:39,400 --> 01:43:42,250
I'm good with being single right now...

1995
01:43:47,060 --> 01:43:49,230
(No, not there! Not there! Ow, ow...)

1996
01:43:50,460 --> 01:43:52,200
Oh, well then...

1997
01:43:55,490 --> 01:44:00,240
Completely unrelated to this program: You've all just been Rick Roll'ed

1998
01:44:00,580 --> 01:44:02,530
Cut it out, mercy!

1999
01:44:02,530 --> 01:44:04,770
Huh!?

2000
01:44:06,220 --> 01:44:07,730
What's up?

2001
01:44:07,280 --> 01:44:09,700
Producer

2002
01:44:07,280 --> 01:44:09,700
Yoshinobu Nakamura

2003
01:44:09,910 --> 01:44:12,250
Didn't you go to the US?

2004
01:44:12,250 --> 01:44:14,250
What's up?

2005
01:44:12,870 --> 01:44:18,230
Yoshinobu!

2006
01:44:16,250 --> 01:44:18,250
Didn't you go to the US?

2007
01:44:19,520 --> 01:44:21,530
You've got to be kidding me!?

2008
01:44:26,130 --> 01:44:27,400
Pretty Amazing!

2009
01:44:27,400 --> 01:44:30,250
Stop putting Yoshinobu in these things!!

2010
01:44:33,490 --> 01:44:35,110
Who's he supposed to be?

2011
01:44:34,430 --> 01:44:38,000
So Yoshibu-san decided to join this group this year

2012
01:44:38,180 --> 01:44:39,300
No kidding...

2013
01:44:40,020 --> 01:44:42,370
I kept wondering, "Who could it be?"

2014
01:44:40,970 --> 01:44:42,370
Huh!?

2015
01:44:44,270 --> 01:44:45,280
What's up?

2016
01:44:45,280 --> 01:44:47,060
Yoshinobu!!

2017
01:44:47,060 --> 01:44:50,140
Hang on, didn't you go to the US!?

2018
01:44:50,140 --> 01:44:51,310
Yeah, I was...

2019
01:44:51,310 --> 01:44:55,870
But I felt like seeing you guys again, that's all

2020
01:44:55,870 --> 01:44:59,920
And just as always, you're never on time

2021
01:44:59,920 --> 01:45:04,270
Captain, I don't need to hear your life lessons anymore

2022
01:45:04,770 --> 01:45:06,450
Long time no see!

2023
01:45:06,450 --> 01:45:08,450
Yeah!

2024
01:45:11,810 --> 01:45:14,100
Where's Ohsawa by the way?

2025
01:45:14,100 --> 01:45:17,850
Just like the old days, he'd rather be alone

2026
01:45:19,410 --> 01:45:21,020
How about you, Ritsuko?

2027
01:45:21,470 --> 01:45:23,110
You two are dating, right?

2028
01:45:25,450 --> 01:45:28,800
Sorry, but I don't really...

2029
01:45:28,800 --> 01:45:33,160
Let's not dwell on a guy who's a no-show

2030
01:45:33,160 --> 01:45:36,400
Let's hear about your US adventure instead

2031
01:45:35,340 --> 01:45:37,160
Yeah, weren't you in New York?

2032
01:45:37,180 --> 01:45:39,160
Did you see Michael Jordan walking around?

2033
01:45:48,070 --> 01:45:50,420
Tanaka...

2034
01:45:49,020 --> 01:45:50,420
Yeah?

2035
01:45:51,040 --> 01:45:54,160
So things with Ohsawa aren't going well?

2036
01:45:55,000 --> 01:45:57,350
What do you mean?

2037
01:45:57,350 --> 01:46:00,140
When his name came up tonight,

2038
01:46:00,140 --> 01:46:02,490
you sort of turned away

2039
01:46:02,490 --> 01:46:07,690
Which is exactly what you always used to do

2040
01:46:08,030 --> 01:46:09,480
So that was a dead giveaway

2041
01:46:11,760 --> 01:46:15,400
You caught me, Gitan

2042
01:46:15,400 --> 01:46:20,480
But don't worry, this is nothing new

2043
01:46:20,480 --> 01:46:25,400
Speaking of which, Gitan, it was only you...

2044
01:46:28,670 --> 01:46:30,970
What kind of name is Gitan?

2045
01:46:35,400 --> 01:46:40,550
I figured there'd be a better name than that

2046
01:46:41,940 --> 01:46:45,010
Thanks for walking me home

2047
01:46:51,430 --> 01:46:54,170
Gitan!

2048
01:46:57,800 --> 01:46:59,140
Tanaka!

2049
01:46:59,140 --> 01:47:02,550
I'm sorry. I lied...

2050
01:47:02,550 --> 01:47:05,910
I'm afraid my relationship with him is over

2051
01:47:05,910 --> 01:47:09,090
I can never tell what he's thinking...

2052
01:47:09,090 --> 01:47:11,880
And I never know what to do!

2053
01:47:10,460 --> 01:47:12,860
What a quick turn of an event

2054
01:47:11,880 --> 01:47:14,120
Gitan!

2055
01:47:16,110 --> 01:47:18,020
The music sounds like Omega Tribe

2056
01:47:18,020 --> 01:47:20,320
I think it's them

2057
01:47:20,320 --> 01:47:21,720
This is their song?

2058
01:47:26,720 --> 01:47:28,220
Amazing

2059
01:47:28,220 --> 01:47:30,600
Look at this cast!

2060
01:47:34,900 --> 01:47:37,420
It really HAS been a long time HASN'T it?

2061
01:47:35,230 --> 01:48:26,390
Next Week

2062
01:47:44,230 --> 01:47:48,540
I love you more than anybody else in this world

2063
01:47:48,540 --> 01:47:50,540
Marry me!

2064
01:47:51,380 --> 01:47:53,050
What a spoiler

2065
01:47:53,050 --> 01:47:56,140
That's the whole story right there

2066
01:47:58,430 --> 01:48:00,940
It's about time.  It's your turn, Gitan

2067
01:48:01,030 --> 01:48:02,940
Wait,

2068
01:48:02,940 --> 01:48:04,400
Now that you mention it...

2069
01:48:04,450 --> 01:48:07,090
If Ritsuko and Hosaka got married,

2070
01:48:07,120 --> 01:48:09,280
then your name your name will be

2071
01:48:09,440 --> 01:48:11,950
Tanaka Naoki

2072
01:48:10,980 --> 01:48:11,980
Cut it out

2073
01:48:12,030 --> 01:48:13,410
Tanaka Naoki is completely OUT

2074
01:48:13,410 --> 01:48:16,320
Tanaka Naoki is completely OUT

2075
01:48:16,320 --> 01:48:17,220

01:48:22,770 --> 01:48:25,940
Tanaka Naoki is completely Thai Kicked

2079
01:48:26,680 --> 01:48:28,930
See you next week!

2080
01:48:36,910 --> 01:48:43,420
Tanaka's Second Thai Kick of the Day

2081
01:48:38,470 --> 01:48:39,870
I can't do this anymore!

2082
01:48:39,870 --> 01:48:41,170
This is too much

2083
01:48:41,170 --> 01:48:43,170
Yes, this is way too much

2084
01:48:46,670 --> 01:48:48,860
You can't be sitting down though

2085
01:48:49,740 --> 01:48:51,930
Could you wait a minute?

2086
01:48:52,140 --> 01:48:53,680
I hear you, but...

2087
01:48:53,730 --> 01:48:55,480
What're you gonna do though?

2088
01:48:55,480 --> 01:48:57,910
Stand up straight, otherwise, it'll hurt more

2089
01:48:57,480 --> 01:48:59,480
Get your hands up

2090
01:48:58,890 --> 01:49:01,480
No matter what, he's not going to be easy on you

2091
01:49:10,600 --> 01:49:15,300
How do you expect us not to laugh after seeing that reaction?!

2092
01:49:15,300 --> 01:49:17,300
You gotta get it together though

2093
01:49:34,870 --> 01:49:37,460
Tanaka, seriously, cut it out

2094
01:49:38,600 --> 01:49:40,740
I'm sure that hurt

2095
01:49:45,080 --> 01:49:48,430
And this might be your last

2096
01:49:51,080 --> 01:49:54,440
The real training starts right now

2097
01:49:55,610 --> 01:49:57,530
Can I have your attention please

2098
01:49:57,650 --> 01:49:59,640
Here at the GIA,

2099
01:50:00,020 --> 01:50:03,560
there is a special training course for newcomers

2100
01:50:04,090 --> 01:50:06,830
And there are no exceptions,

2101
01:50:07,490 --> 01:50:10,100
so please change into these uniforms

2102
01:50:11,000 --> 01:50:18,740
GIA Special Training

2103
01:50:11,860 --> 01:50:13,570
Training?

2104
01:50:13,630 --> 01:50:15,500
This is such a drag

2105
01:50:15,530 --> 01:50:16,770
Yeah, it is

2106
01:50:16,940 --> 01:50:19,670
These uniforms make me think this won't be easy

2107
01:50:19,810 --> 01:50:27,250
Gearing Up for Special Training

2108
01:50:20,470 --> 01:50:23,810
Prior to training, they change into training outfits

2109
01:50:25,040 --> 01:50:26,510

The Real Training Starts Now!!

2112
01:50:28,710 --> 01:50:31,350
What could be their special training?

2113
01:50:31,550 --> 01:50:34,750
The beginning of their special training

2114
01:50:35,220 --> 01:50:36,590
Training...

2115
01:50:42,210 --> 01:50:46,500
Do we really need training for our training?

2116
01:50:51,070 --> 01:50:54,720
Man, this feels kind of weird

2117
01:50:55,610 --> 01:51:01,610
Training Grounds

2118
01:50:59,400 --> 01:51:01,950
Looks like this is going to be difficult

2119
01:51:02,710 --> 01:51:05,050
It's still raining

2120
01:51:05,720 --> 01:51:07,890
Line up in order right here

2121
01:51:11,820 --> 01:51:15,190
We will now start your spy training

2122
01:51:15,530 --> 01:51:17,850
But before we begin, take a look over there

2123
01:51:23,600 --> 01:51:25,600
NO WAY!!

2124
01:51:25,970 --> 01:51:27,190
You're joking right?

2125
01:51:27,290 --> 01:51:30,480
Please don't tell me this is what I think it is

2126
01:51:30,480 --> 01:51:33,510
Well, doesn't this bring back memories?

2127
01:51:33,510 --> 01:51:34,350
Nightmares!!

2128
01:51:35,510 --> 01:51:38,780
Their Minds Fill With Terrible Memories...

2129
01:51:39,850 --> 01:51:46,790

24 Hour Endurance Tag

2131
01:51:40,020 --> 01:51:46,200
It's a symbol of their 24-hour game of tag from 10 yrs ago

2132
01:51:47,430 --> 01:51:52,800
What is Their Special Training!?

2133
01:51:47,830 --> 01:51:50,260
What special training is in store for them?

2134
01:51:50,260 --> 01:51:51,890
This was tough

2135
01:51:53,150 --> 01:51:55,030
This is an escape exercise!!

2136
01:51:55,100 --> 01:51:56,870
No way!  No way!

2137
01:51:56,870 --> 01:52:00,110
We shouldn't be doing something like this in the rain!

2138
01:52:00,140 --> 01:52:03,710
I really, really hate this!

2139
01:52:03,710 --> 01:52:07,710
As you know, you will receive the punishment

2140
01:52:04,110 --> 01:52:11,280

Spy Escape Training

2154
01:52:34,370 --> 01:52:40,010
Matsumoto, you just had an operation, so you can't be running around right?

2155
01:52:38,410 --> 01:52:39,750
No, I really can't

2156
01:52:40,380 --> 01:52:44,850
In that case, we found a substitute for you

2157
01:52:43,320 --> 01:52:44,850
YES!

2158
01:52:47,220 --> 01:52:49,020
Seriously, I can't be running around

2159
01:52:49,020 --> 01:52:50,950
Why didn't they get this?

2160
01:52:53,720 --> 01:52:55,440
How spunky is this guy?

2161
01:53:02,420 --> 01:53:07,860
Matsumoto, you just had an operation, so you can't be running around right?

2162
01:53:06,390 --> 01:53:07,760
No, I really can't

2163
01:53:08,290 --> 01:53:11,360
In that case, we found a substitute for you

2164
01:53:11,360 --> 01:53:12,930
YES!

2165
01:53:12,930 --> 01:53:17,270
The Other Four Don't Understand Why

2166
01:53:13,030 --> 01:53:13,900
Why?

2167
01:53:13,900 --> 01:53:17,000
Because I really can't run

2168
01:53:17,000 --> 01:53:18,630
Why don't you get this?

2169
01:53:19,130 --> 01:53:20,150
Hey!

2170
01:53:23,870 --> 01:53:25,490
How spunky is this guy?

2171
01:53:25,490 --> 01:53:26,760
Who the hell...?

2172
01:53:27,240 --> 01:53:30,910
Ikki Sawamura (Actor)

Matsumoto's Substitute

2174
01:53:33,930 --> 01:53:35,990
We still can't laugh?

2175
01:53:35,990 --> 01:53:36,610
Huh?

2176
01:53:36,610 --> 01:53:39,290
It's raining harder now

2177
01:53:39,730 --> 01:53:42,670
Hey, everyone's getting wet

2178
01:53:44,520 --> 01:53:46,100
It doesn't matter, they'll do it anyway

2179
01:53:46,590 --> 01:53:47,440
It's so wet

2180
01:53:47,430 --> 01:53:50,770
Are you OK with this?  Do you know what you're getting into?

2181
01:53:49,760 --> 01:53:50,450
Yes

2182
01:53:50,770 --> 01:53:53,670
I only know that I will be paid well for this!!

2183
01:53:57,470 --> 01:54:00,280
Is that how you choose your work?

2184
01:54:02,000 --> 01:54:03,700
You gotta be kiddin' me!

2185
01:54:04,180 --> 01:54:06,250
Don't talk like that, Sawamura-san

2186
01:54:05,810 --> 01:54:08,220
I doubt you'll be paid that well

2187
01:54:17,360 --> 01:54:18,820
OK, let's start!

2188
01:54:19,060 --> 01:54:21,630
And what am I supposed to do??

2189
01:54:20,400 --> 01:54:21,650
The taggers will show up

2190
01:54:21,680 --> 01:54:23,260
Just keep running away

2191
01:54:23,260 --> 01:54:24,720
That's your only goal

2192
01:54:24,500 --> 01:54:27,970
OK, let's get started

2193
01:54:25,530 --> 01:54:27,970
COUGH

2194
01:54:26,270 --> 01:54:27,970
COUGH

Slipper

2198
01:54:35,940 --> 01:54:37,750
He's super fast

2199
01:54:37,750 --> 01:54:40,280
Yeah, very fast

2200
01:54:44,190 --> 01:54:45,320
That'll leave some mark

2201
01:54:51,530 --> 01:54:56,600
Three Devils Are Released

2202
01:54:53,130 --> 01:54:56,760
For the first 20 mins, 3 Devils will follow them

2204
01:55:10,880 --> 01:55:13,310
Not an ideal condition for running

I don't see Hamada

2214
01:55:48,150 --> 01:55:50,520
I think he took off somewhere

2215
01:55:55,660 --> 01:55:58,490
I'm dying

2216
01:55:59,090 --> 01:56:02,660
I can't get away from them all

2217
01:56:04,370 --> 01:56:11,010
15 minutes have passed, and the 3 Devils enter the building to search for the cast

2218
01:56:07,570 --> 01:56:12,270
The 3 Devils search the building

2219
01:56:14,110 --> 01:56:18,850
The Five Members Regroup

2220
01:56:14,310 --> 01:56:16,540
So tiring...

2221
01:56:17,510 --> 01:56:18,880
Did they get you yet?

2222
01:56:18,880 --> 01:56:19,980
Yes...Dekopin

2223
01:56:19,980 --> 01:56:23,350
You can see it on our backs

2224
01:56:23,350 --> 01:56:26,190
Cocorico got punished a lot

2225
01:56:27,420 --> 01:56:34,430
It starts to pour, and Matsumoto returns alone to the spy training room

2226
01:56:29,190 --> 01:56:34,800
Matsumoto Returns to the Training Room

2227
01:56:36,200 --> 01:56:40,030
Last month I got my appendix removed

2228
01:56:36,900 --> 01:56:38,630
I was bored out of my mind

2229
01:56:39,700 --> 01:56:40,240
Really?

2230
01:56:40,540 --> 01:56:43,540
Appendix Operation 1 Month Ago

2231
01:56:41,490 --> 01:56:43,920
I hope you got my my back, Hamada-san

2232
01:56:43,640 --> 01:56:45,470
What? Why did you take this job?

2233
01:56:46,070 --> 01:56:48,080
Because I can get paid a lot...

2234
01:56:48,640 --> 01:56:52,350
His priority is money, no matter what

2235
01:56:53,680 --> 01:56:56,480
20 minutes have passed

2236
01:56:57,120 --> 01:57:02,620
5 More Devils Are Added

2237
01:56:58,220 --> 01:57:01,160
5 More Devils Added

2238
01:57:03,390 --> 01:57:09,660
After 5 Additions, a Total of 8 Devils Are on the Field!

2239
01:57:03,390 --> 01:57:09,660
Biting

2240
01:57:03,390 --> 01:57:09,660
Dekopin

2241
01:57:03,390 --> 01:57:09,660
Slipper

2242
01:57:03,790 --> 01:57:09,660
Slap

2243
01:57:04,330 --> 01:57:09,660
Back flip

2244
01:57:04,790 --> 01:57:09,660
Harisen

2245
01:57:05,360 --> 01:57:09,660
Ch$%ko
Machine

2246
01:57:09,660 --> 01:57:13,470
But the five men are unaware of this

2247
01:57:10,200 --> 01:57:13,500
The Unsuspecting Five

2248
01:57:13,470 --> 01:57:16,470
Sawamura-san, could you go look around outside?

2249
01:57:17,110 --> 01:57:19,510
Just to make sure those guys in black aren't around

2250
01:57:19,510 --> 01:57:21,210
And we'll look around in here

2251
01:57:23,750 --> 01:57:28,850
Sawamura Goes Alone to Check Outside

2252
01:57:34,160 --> 01:57:35,160
What?!

2253
01:57:35,160 --> 01:57:37,160
Oh...it's my shadow

2254
01:57:37,630 --> 01:57:41,100
Sawamura Surprised by His Own Shadow

2255
01:57:42,130 --> 01:57:44,200
What?  Is he getting punished?

2256
01:57:44,200 --> 01:57:46,730
No, he's just super nervous

2257
01:57:48,270 --> 01:57:49,470
So scary

2258
01:57:51,340 --> 01:57:53,310
There he is

2259
01:57:53,310 --> 01:57:54,040
Dekopin?

2260
01:57:56,180 --> 01:58:09,060
Dekopin

2261
01:57:56,180 --> 01:58:09,060
Distance to Target

2262
01:58:00,350 --> 01:58:01,250
What's happening!?

2263
01:58:01,250 --> 01:58:04,550
Dekopin!  Dekopin is coming!!

2264
01:58:10,060 --> 01:58:11,930
He's coming!!

2265
01:58:13,660 --> 01:58:14,770
Dekopin is here!

2266
01:58:19,000 --> 01:58:30,950
Dekopin

2267
01:58:24,710 --> 01:58:27,440
He's here!!

2268
01:58:42,990 --> 01:58:45,130
It's a dead end

2269
01:58:49,530 --> 01:58:52,600
Avoided Dekopin

2270
01:58:53,190 --> 01:58:57,940
Why did I take this gig...

2271
01:58:58,410 --> 01:59:02,510
Sawamura avoided Dekopin, but he now goes after the other 4 men

2272
01:58:59,040 --> 01:59:07,980
Dekopin

2273
01:58:59,040 --> 01:59:07,980
Distance to the 4 Targets

2274
01:59:02,910 --> 01:59:04,740
Who dropped that?

2275
01:59:04,740 --> 01:59:05,670
Oh

2276
01:59:05,670 --> 01:59:06,720
Yours, Tanaka?

2277
01:59:06,720 --> 01:59:07,910
Is that mine?

2278
01:59:08,850 --> 01:59:10,920
He's coming.. coming.. coming!!

2279
01:59:19,990 --> 01:59:23,030
This way leads to a dead end

2280
01:59:28,300 --> 01:59:29,900
What are you doing?

2281
01:59:30,340 --> 01:59:32,610
How dare you take a coffee break?!

2282
01:59:32,740 --> 01:59:34,610
There was nothing else to do!

2283
01:59:34,510 --> 01:59:46,990
Dekopin

2284
01:59:34,510 --> 01:59:46,990
Distance to Hamada

2285
01:59:39,750 --> 01:59:43,380
Hamada Escapes to a Camera-Free Zone

2286
01:59:47,660 --> 01:59:49,220
WHOA!!

2287
01:59:48,420 --> 01:59:49,230
Whoaaahhhh~!!

2288
02:00:11,800 --> 02:00:13,790
I'm exhausted

2289
02:00:14,110 --> 02:00:17,660
Hamada - Heart Break

2290
02:00:19,300 --> 02:00:23,530
Matsumoto - Tea Break

2291
02:00:26,060 --> 02:00:28,040
How dare you sigh like that

2292
02:00:30,320 --> 02:00:35,140
Back flip

2293
02:00:30,320 --> 02:00:35,140
Biting

2294
02:00:30,320 --> 02:00:35,140
D@#$ Machine

2295
02:00:30,320 --> 02:00:35,140
Dekopin

2296
02:00:30,320 --> 02:00:35,140
Harisen

2297
02:00:30,320 --> 02:00:35,140
Slap

2298
02:00:30,320 --> 02:00:35,140
Slipper

2299
02:00:31,360 --> 02:00:35,140
8 Devil Types!!

2300
02:00:35,620 --> 02:00:40,560
Some Devils hide and wait for their prey

2301
02:00:53,210 --> 02:00:54,530
Wait a minute!

2302
02:00:55,580 --> 02:00:56,830
Seriously?

2303
02:00:56,830 --> 02:00:58,040
What's this?

2304
02:00:57,080 --> 02:00:58,640
He was subjected to this?

2305
02:00:58,640 --> 02:00:59,620
What is this?

2306
02:00:58,800 --> 02:01:01,070
Wait, wait, wait!

2307
02:00:59,660 --> 02:01:00,960
It's the D#$% Machine

2308
02:01:00,460 --> 02:01:09,480
D@#$ Machine

2309
02:01:05,370 --> 02:01:09,380
Countdown

2310
02:01:26,750 --> 02:01:32,770
Ikki Sawamura (43 years old) writhes in pain

2311
02:01:33,540 --> 02:01:35,140
Please, excuse me

2312
02:01:35,440 --> 02:01:40,940
Sawamura shakes "it" back

2313
02:01:41,110 --> 02:01:43,610
[Camera Man] - You can't go in there

2314
02:01:45,910 --> 02:01:47,210
"You can't go in there"

2315
02:01:47,230 --> 02:01:49,990
My guess is they'll come this way

2316
02:01:50,020 --> 02:01:51,710
I'll keep an eye on upstairs

2317
02:01:51,780 --> 02:01:55,240
Yamasaki, Tanaka, and Endo watch for Devils in the main building

2318
02:01:55,780 --> 02:01:58,160
I'm looking over here

2319
02:01:59,000 --> 02:02:00,760
Don't forget, they're in black

2320
02:02:01,870 --> 02:02:03,100
I see someone

2321
02:02:03,100 --> 02:02:04,000
Is that Hamada-san?

2322
02:02:04,000 --> 02:02:05,600
Hamada-san!!

2323
02:02:05,840 --> 02:02:07,800
He's under the spotlight

2324
02:02:08,290 --> 02:02:11,470
Superstar Hamada - Always Under the Spotlight

2325
02:02:13,070 --> 02:02:14,130
Who do you think you are!?

2326
02:02:14,130 --> 02:02:16,400
It's not like I asked to be in the spotlight

2327
02:02:19,190 --> 02:02:20,620
What kind of Devil are you?

2328
02:02:20,620 --> 02:02:21,580
What?

2329
02:02:22,490 --> 02:02:23,320
What did it say?

2330
02:02:23,320 --> 02:02:25,350
It started with an "A"

2331
02:02:27,960 --> 02:02:32,900
A Devil Cigarette Break

2332
02:02:34,870 --> 02:02:37,400
"A Smoke Break?"

2333
02:02:36,370 --> 02:03:03,290
A Smoke Break

2334
02:02:37,400 --> 02:02:40,620
A "Cigarette" Break

2335
02:02:44,140 --> 02:02:45,340
How does this work?

2336
02:02:45,340 --> 02:02:48,340
I'm utterly lost over here

2337
02:02:51,830 --> 02:02:53,240
It's not like you can talk to him, right?

2338
02:02:54,160 --> 02:02:55,610
"How does this work?"

2339
02:02:59,260 --> 02:03:02,060
This is one of the lucky ones

2340
02:03:02,060 --> 02:03:03,660
Thank you very much

2341
02:03:05,230 --> 02:03:07,360
He got a good one

2342
02:03:08,770 --> 02:03:15,000
Back flip

2343
02:03:08,880 --> 02:03:12,000
Threatening Shadows Approach Them

2344
02:03:13,060 --> 02:03:14,170
Man, it's pouring now

2345
02:03:15,870 --> 02:03:18,370
Hamada! Behind you, behind you!!!

2346
02:03:17,240 --> 02:03:19,330
How dare you call me Hamada

2347
02:03:19,450 --> 02:03:20,910
Hamada! Behind you, behind you!!

2348
02:03:21,210 --> 02:03:24,580
Hamada! Behind you, behind you!!

2349
02:03:24,580 --> 02:03:27,980
Endo disrespects his mentor, Hamada-san

2350
02:03:24,580 --> 02:03:27,980
In a Panic,

2351
02:03:31,090 --> 02:03:32,920
I meant to say, "Hamada-san, behind you"

2352
02:03:36,260 --> 02:03:40,400
The Gorilla Boss Finds a Perfect Hiding Place

2353
02:03:40,000 --> 02:03:40,980
How creepy!

2354
02:03:48,650 --> 02:03:50,440
Mysterious headlights

2355
02:04:01,690 --> 02:04:03,000
That's dangerous

2356
02:04:03,000 --> 02:04:13,200
Harisen (Large Fan)

2357
02:04:13,960 --> 02:04:16,800
Wow, he was chased by a car?

2358
02:04:17,470 --> 02:04:20,900
Hamada Laughs at Another's Misfortune

2359
02:04:26,980 --> 02:04:28,440
They came at me with a car

2360
02:04:28,440 --> 02:04:30,110
That was hairy

2361
02:04:30,110 --> 02:04:32,150
I could've been run over

2362
02:04:32,150 --> 02:04:33,970
I got caught by "A Smoke Break"

2363
02:04:34,110 --> 02:04:36,780
Ah, I see what it means now

2364
02:04:39,490 --> 02:04:44,560
Traumatized By the Car Chase

2365
02:04:39,490 --> 02:04:44,560
Yamasaki -

2366
02:04:45,530 --> 02:04:48,320
30 minutes have passed

2367
02:04:46,760 --> 02:04:49,460
Tell me what kind of editing that was!

2368
02:04:49,470 --> 02:04:54,500
Trainee's Room

2369
02:04:49,670 --> 02:04:54,500
Annex

2370
02:04:49,670 --> 02:04:54,500
Gym

2371
02:04:49,670 --> 02:04:54,500
Main

2372
02:04:49,780 --> 02:04:54,780
As Tanaka and Sawamura take cover inside,
the others are in front of the gym

2373
02:04:55,860 --> 02:05:00,940
More Tagging Devils are summoned

2374
02:05:03,110 --> 02:05:04,650
Why aren't they coming after us?

2375
02:05:04,650 --> 02:05:06,720
You know, that Harisen group...

2376
02:05:06,720 --> 02:05:09,320
As long as we stay still, they can't detect us

2377
02:05:09,320 --> 02:05:12,320
I see...like dinosaurs

2378
02:05:12,320 --> 02:05:17,060
You know dinosaurs can only detect movement

2379
02:05:17,060 --> 02:05:19,480
Shozo, why don't you get closer then

2380
02:05:19,600 --> 02:05:21,430
They can also detect oxygen

2381
02:05:22,590 --> 02:05:24,180
Go walk past them

2382
02:05:34,340 --> 02:05:37,450
Hamada enjoys other's misfortune

2383
02:05:34,340 --> 02:05:37,450
Once again,

2384
02:05:37,960 --> 02:05:55,430
Fatso

2385
02:05:39,050 --> 02:05:41,820
Wow, I can actually outrun these guys

2386
02:05:43,320 --> 02:05:45,040
Did Endou get away...

2387
02:05:46,020 --> 02:05:47,420
Ha, ha, ha!!

2388
02:05:51,260 --> 02:05:51,760
What, what what??

2389
02:05:51,760 --> 02:05:51,890
What, what what??

2390
02:05:51,890 --> 02:05:52,230
What, what what??

2391
02:05:52,280 --> 02:05:52,700
Serious? Seriously?

2392
02:05:52,700 --> 02:05:53,360
Serious? Seriously?

2393
02:05:53,360 --> 02:05:55,130
Cut it out, stop, stop, stop!!

2394
02:05:55,380 --> 02:05:56,750
Serious, serious, you're kidding me

2395
02:06:00,310 --> 02:06:05,710
Punishment : Mega Slap

2396
02:06:08,180 --> 02:06:12,080
After watching Yamasaki get slapped,

2397
02:06:10,380 --> 02:06:16,420
Hamada Flees           While the Fatso's are Distracted

2398
02:06:12,390 --> 02:06:14,810
Hamada changes his hiding place

2399
02:06:16,140 --> 02:06:17,720
But...

2400
02:06:20,390 --> 02:06:33,370
Fatso

2401
02:06:31,460 --> 02:06:32,550
You're fast...

2402
02:06:43,910 --> 02:06:49,020
Hamada         at his Ugliest

2403
02:06:47,410 --> 02:06:48,690
Leave him alone

2404
02:06:50,590 --> 02:06:51,670
That was hellish

2405
02:06:52,220 --> 02:06:53,940
Definitely hell

2406
02:06:54,490 --> 02:06:57,490
I thought they couldn't see us if we stay put

2407
02:06:57,490 --> 02:06:59,960
I take it back

2408
02:06:59,970 --> 02:07:02,540
They can see us

2409
02:07:02,700 --> 02:07:05,670
What if they're behind us right now?

2410
02:07:06,050 --> 02:07:08,830
They        Are Terrified of the Tagging Devils

2411
02:07:08,830 --> 02:07:11,440
They're different than what I remembered...

2412
02:07:11,760 --> 02:07:13,310
They've evolved over the years

2413
02:07:13,340 --> 02:07:17,930
Just as they're reminded of the Devil's terrifying nature...

2414
02:07:22,920 --> 02:07:25,450
I know we can beat him

2415
02:07:27,720 --> 02:07:29,530
He didn't evolve for sure

2416
02:07:29,530 --> 02:07:31,860
Yeah, he actually regressed

2417
02:07:30,060 --> 02:07:54,350
Heipo

2418
02:07:31,220 --> 02:07:32,510
I'm afraid he's gonna hurt himself...

2419
02:07:32,920 --> 02:07:34,440
This is a great opportunity

2420
02:07:34,790 --> 02:07:36,480
to take out our frustrations on him

2421
02:07:38,270 --> 02:07:40,070
I've got a Harisen!

2422
02:07:51,950 --> 02:07:54,350
Go away!

2423
02:07:54,880 --> 02:07:58,120
I can beat that particular Devil

2424
02:07:58,120 --> 02:07:59,860
He hasn't changed

2425
02:08:00,020 --> 02:08:04,880
Not Much        Gas Left in His Tank

2426
02:08:11,030 --> 02:08:16,440
Another          Encounter with Fatso

2427
02:08:14,160 --> 02:08:16,300
I've seen enough of their battles

2428
02:08:18,570 --> 02:08:23,070
Mega-Running        Hamada

2429
02:08:21,110 --> 02:08:23,440
Seriously, I've seen enough of you and the fatso

2430
02:08:24,080 --> 02:08:29,990
Mega-Sleeping        Matsumoto

2431
02:08:27,460 --> 02:08:28,990
I wasn't asleep, moron!!

2432
02:08:28,330 --> 02:08:29,970
How dare you...

2433
02:08:34,760 --> 02:08:36,730
How're you doing?

2434
02:08:36,760 --> 02:08:38,620
I'm OK but...

2435
02:08:45,270 --> 02:08:51,840
Handsome Man Used Ugliest Man         As a Shield

2436
02:08:51,990 --> 02:08:53,610
What now?

2437
02:08:53,800 --> 02:09:11,860
Fishing

2438
02:09:16,800 --> 02:09:21,170
How is....how is my nose looking?

2439
02:09:21,170 --> 02:09:25,710
I'd say it's gotten bigger...or wider

2440
02:09:24,320 --> 02:09:25,710
You're kidding right?

2441
02:09:26,340 --> 02:09:30,010
50 minutes have passed

2442
02:09:30,460 --> 02:09:33,440
More Devils are summoned

2443
02:09:36,150 --> 02:09:38,830
15 Tagging Devils

2444
02:09:39,430 --> 02:09:43,280
And no place for them to hide

2445
02:09:46,390 --> 02:09:50,100
They have an advantage wearing all black...

2446
02:09:57,300 --> 02:09:58,440
This sucks!

2447
02:09:58,490 --> 02:10:00,500
Where did you come from?

2448
02:10:00,500 --> 02:10:02,610
Where the hell did you come from!!??

2449
02:10:02,670 --> 02:10:04,840
Here he comes, comes, comes, comes, comes

2450
02:10:05,190 --> 02:10:07,300
Here comes some seaweed

2451
02:10:07,350 --> 02:10:18,160
Seaweed

2452
02:10:09,260 --> 02:10:11,290
What...what do you have?

2453
02:10:18,760 --> 02:10:23,050
Who would've thought you'd be hiding there?!

2454
02:10:23,200 --> 02:10:26,090
Seaweed

2455
02:10:24,720 --> 02:10:31,120
One victim after the other...

2456
02:10:26,640 --> 02:10:31,170
With so many Devils in the area, the cast become victims one by one

2457
02:10:27,420 --> 02:10:29,020
Slipper

2458
02:10:29,060 --> 02:10:40,650
Fishing

2459
02:10:35,880 --> 02:10:40,110
Yamasaki        is on the verge of being traumatized again

2460
02:10:41,060 --> 02:10:47,490
Slipper

2461
02:10:44,550 --> 02:10:47,490
Seaweed

2462
02:10:47,740 --> 02:10:50,000
Sawamura got cornered by the Slipper and Seaweed!!

2463
02:10:50,000 --> 02:10:51,940
That's the worst

2464
02:10:51,940 --> 02:10:54,020
Could the "Fishing" Devil be coming for him too?

2465
02:10:54,020 --> 02:10:55,260
You're kiddin' me!!

2466
02:10:55,340 --> 02:10:56,820
I hate the Slap!!

2467
02:10:55,610 --> 02:11:04,760
Slap

2468
02:10:58,210 --> 02:11:02,330
Sawamura becomes victim to the Slap

2469
02:11:14,180 --> 02:11:21,990
Actor Ikki Sawamura
Gets a Real Slap

2470
02:11:17,290 --> 02:11:21,100
They should've taken him to the fishing area

2471
02:11:24,280 --> 02:11:26,190
Seriously, what in the hell are we doing?

2472
02:11:26,270 --> 02:11:28,170
What is this?

2473
02:11:28,440 --> 02:11:31,700
Whatever happened to  the "No Laughing" rules?

2474
02:11:31,700 --> 02:11:35,430
This has nothing to do with that

2475
02:11:36,060 --> 02:11:40,240
Who approaches Sawamura after having just been slapped..??

2476
02:11:40,880 --> 02:12:01,230
Fishing

2477
02:11:41,880 --> 02:11:43,750
There he is again

2478
02:11:47,650 --> 02:11:48,870
They got me already!

2479
02:11:48,870 --> 02:11:50,240
I just had this!

2480
02:11:50,240 --> 02:11:51,250
I just got fished!!

2481
02:11:51,250 --> 02:11:52,810
Seriously, this just happened to me!!

2482
02:11:52,810 --> 02:11:54,410
I was fished already!!

2483
02:11:54,410 --> 02:11:56,760
Cut me some slack!!!

2484
02:11:57,060 --> 02:11:58,600
Nobody deserves to be fished twice

2485
02:11:59,000 --> 02:12:01,300
He got fished again?

2486
02:12:01,380 --> 02:12:03,920
There's a lot of "Fishing" Devils around

2487
02:12:04,000 --> 02:12:10,520
There's been a lot of monsters where Tanaka's roaming around

2488
02:12:09,420 --> 02:12:10,500
Why're you calling them "monsters?"

2489
02:12:10,500 --> 02:12:30,640
Fishing

2490
02:12:17,010 --> 02:12:19,330
Nobody deserves this punishment twice

2491
02:12:19,710 --> 02:12:20,220
That hurts

2492
02:12:20,220 --> 02:12:21,800
You're gonna yank my nose off

2493
02:12:21,800 --> 02:12:24,160
That kills

2494
02:12:28,010 --> 02:12:31,400
Seriously, this hurts!!

2495
02:12:34,330 --> 02:12:36,360
You were like, "It hurts!"

2496
02:12:36,840 --> 02:12:39,280
You were all, "You're yanking my nose off!"

2497
02:12:44,520 --> 02:12:47,660
Only five minutes left

2498
02:12:47,660 --> 02:12:51,880
The group reunites again

2499
02:12:53,370 --> 02:12:55,850
Hang on a sec, OK?

2500
02:12:56,050 --> 02:13:00,310
What...are you friends with those monsters now?

2501
02:13:03,390 --> 02:13:06,260
Yeah, that was my second time getting fished

2502
02:13:06,260 --> 02:13:08,600
I just witnessed it

2503
02:13:08,600 --> 02:13:10,970
I can't shake them off anymore

2504
02:13:10,970 --> 02:13:12,800
By the time I see them, it's too late

2505
02:13:12,660 --> 02:13:15,570
Devil Sneaks His Way in

2506
02:13:16,280 --> 02:13:17,620
So how much longer do...

2507
02:13:18,690 --> 02:13:25,830
Slipper

2508
02:13:23,190 --> 02:13:24,970
That slipper hurt bad

2509
02:13:24,970 --> 02:13:26,820
That delivers a punch

2510
02:13:26,820 --> 02:13:30,480
Yea, that slipper hurts

2511
02:13:31,470 --> 02:13:35,030
How dare you ditch me like that...

2512
02:13:36,420 --> 02:13:39,780
Funny, this is how I try to get away from them

2513
02:13:39,880 --> 02:13:41,890
You should be protecting me like this

2514
02:13:41,890 --> 02:13:44,960
Sorry, but it's only natural that I do it

2515
02:13:44,960 --> 02:13:46,140
You can't control your instincts

2516
02:13:46,470 --> 02:13:51,070
In the meantime, Tanaka gets chased by another devil

2517
02:13:46,520 --> 02:13:50,000
In the meantime, Tanaka was

2518
02:13:49,740 --> 02:13:51,840
You were chased a lot

2519
02:13:52,510 --> 02:13:53,910
That's enough!

2520
02:13:53,910 --> 02:13:57,070
What is this, what, what, what??

2521
02:13:57,040 --> 02:14:09,120
Matsuri

2522
02:14:00,810 --> 02:14:03,700
What's that?

2523
02:14:05,630 --> 02:14:07,460
This isn't good

2524
02:14:09,310 --> 02:14:14,230
I see, it's some kind of wooden torturing device

2525
02:14:18,050 --> 02:14:20,010
He could get hurt with that

2526
02:14:21,910 --> 02:14:24,520
They got him good now

2527
02:14:32,540 --> 02:14:35,260
That makes me feel better about myself

2528
02:14:36,900 --> 02:14:39,430
That wasn't good at all

2529
02:14:43,260 --> 02:14:46,580
One minute left

2530
02:14:46,580 --> 02:14:50,710
Releasing the last devils

2531
02:14:50,730 --> 02:14:52,920
They're releasing more on the last minute

2532
02:14:52,920 --> 02:14:54,490
All are summoned on the last minute

2533
02:14:54,490 --> 02:14:56,090
I don't want anymore

2534
02:14:56,290 --> 02:14:57,630
He said they're all here

2535
02:14:57,630 --> 02:14:59,510
How am I supposed to...?

2536
02:15:01,280 --> 02:15:02,800
We can outrun them all

2537
02:15:02,800 --> 02:15:04,410
Here they come

2538
02:15:16,770 --> 02:15:30,840
Body Toss

2539
02:15:32,970 --> 02:15:34,760
That's a lot of devils

2540
02:15:37,820 --> 02:15:40,730
Training Complete

2541
02:15:43,220 --> 02:15:48,320
Matsumoto awakes

2542
02:15:49,790 --> 02:15:50,590
I'm exhausted

2543
02:15:51,330 --> 02:15:54,190
That was a rough hour

2544
02:15:54,190 --> 02:15:56,550
That was really really difficult

2545
02:15:56,060 --> 02:15:57,510
Like hell, it was

2546
02:15:58,920 --> 02:16:03,010
That wooden torture device looked kind of fun

2547
02:16:07,780 --> 02:16:11,250
After a hard hour of training

2548
02:16:11,250 --> 02:16:14,800
The cast members wind down from the madness

2549
02:16:15,470 --> 02:16:19,020
Applying Heating Pad

2550
02:16:19,430 --> 02:16:21,580
How come you're so cold?

2551
02:16:21,580 --> 02:16:26,110
Having the heating pad gives me energy

2552
02:16:26,180 --> 02:16:27,740
From good blood circulation, right?

2553
02:16:36,730 --> 02:16:39,400
Hamada Action Figure

2554
02:16:47,700 --> 02:16:49,290
You'd better quit that

2555
02:16:50,070 --> 02:16:52,960
The way Hamada-san flips in the air is too much...

2556
02:16:53,770 --> 02:16:55,690
The flip is full of grace, too

2557
02:16:59,380 --> 02:17:00,750
Yes, that hurt

2558
02:17:11,000 --> 02:17:13,710
Cut it out!!

2559
02:17:17,010 --> 02:17:18,540
Let's not do that anymore, please

2560
02:17:18,590 --> 02:17:20,170
No more Hamada-san back flipping

2561
02:17:22,130 --> 02:17:27,210
I used to practice this all the time with my Kamen Rider figurine

2562
02:17:29,910 --> 02:17:35,030
I used to play with figurines by myself

2563
02:17:35,030 --> 02:17:38,920
and I mastered how the human body flips through the air

2564
02:17:38,920 --> 02:17:41,180
Right, you do that perfectly

2565
02:17:41,180 --> 02:17:44,050
It's a natural motion

2566
02:17:54,140 --> 02:17:56,170
Will you stop doing that, please?

2567
02:17:56,170 --> 02:17:58,990
Let's be done with it

2568
02:17:58,990 --> 02:18:01,940
We're done with it

2569
02:18:05,500 --> 02:18:08,340
Well, nobody's gaining anything from this

2570
02:18:11,850 --> 02:18:14,140
I have to go pee

2571
02:18:15,440 --> 02:18:16,740
Ouch

2572
02:18:16,740 --> 02:18:21,820
Tanaka's got a sensitive ass or something

2573
02:18:30,710 --> 02:18:34,410
Mysterious Person Approaches

2574
02:18:42,720 --> 02:18:45,310
Locks Tanaka in the Stall

2575
02:18:45,530 --> 02:18:49,410
What was that?

2576
02:19:19,170 --> 02:19:21,260
What's this?

2577
02:19:23,800 --> 02:19:25,340
Tanaka?

2578
02:19:25,370 --> 02:19:26,820
Huh?

2579
02:19:40,240 --> 02:19:42,840
Why'd you have to call him like that?

2580
02:19:46,760 --> 02:19:49,080
Our butts are taking a beating, huh?

2581
02:19:49,160 --> 02:19:50,800
Are you really Tanaka?

2582
02:19:52,280 --> 02:19:53,550
Of course, it's me

2583
02:19:53,760 --> 02:19:55,980
What kind of question is that?

2584
02:19:56,350 --> 02:19:59,390
Ask him something only he would know the answer to

2585
02:19:59,690 --> 02:20:01,490
Which middle school did you attend in Toyonaka?

2586
02:20:02,060 --> 02:20:04,530
Toyonaka-3rd-Middle school

2587
02:20:04,930 --> 02:20:06,800
You were "4th"!!

2588
02:20:07,930 --> 02:20:09,470
I...like animals

2589
02:20:09,470 --> 02:20:10,900
I...like animals!

2590
02:20:12,800 --> 02:20:13,870
This isn't Tanaka

2591
02:20:13,870 --> 02:20:15,870
Something isn't right

2592
02:20:16,240 --> 02:20:18,580
Where was our first performance?

2593
02:20:18,580 --> 02:20:20,580
Yeah, I was there, too

2594
02:20:21,910 --> 02:20:23,380
Yeah, it's that place...

2595
02:20:23,750 --> 02:20:24,550
Um...

2596
02:20:24,950 --> 02:20:29,150
Nishi Shinjyuku's Pooku Doll Theater

2597
02:20:34,610 --> 02:20:36,690
How in the hell did you come up with that name?

2598
02:20:36,690 --> 02:20:38,160
I've heard of that place, but...

2599
02:20:38,160 --> 02:20:39,060
But you're wrong!

2600
02:20:41,500 --> 02:20:43,970
Not a bad hit

2601
02:20:43,970 --> 02:20:45,470
Was it at Akasaka?

2602
02:20:45,470 --> 02:20:47,240
It was at Akasaka Play Box

2603
02:20:47,240 --> 02:20:48,770
That's definitely NOT Tanaka

2604
02:20:48,770 --> 02:20:51,410
I really like animals

2605
02:20:51,410 --> 02:20:54,450
Tanaka, share some of your knowledge about animals

2606
02:20:54,450 --> 02:20:55,870
Tell us something about sharks

2607
02:20:55,900 --> 02:20:57,510
The real Tanaka knows this

2608
02:20:57,620 --> 02:20:59,150
Sharks eat monkeys!!

2609
02:20:59,150 --> 02:21:02,750
Sharks eat monkeys!

2610
02:21:07,790 --> 02:21:10,430
That's a scary thought

2611
02:21:15,070 --> 02:21:17,940
What do you call it when...when whales spray water

2612
02:21:18,700 --> 02:21:20,270
You told me before

2613
02:21:21,140 --> 02:21:22,370
When they blow?

2614
02:21:23,340 --> 02:21:27,380
Some whales spray water...

2615
02:21:27,380 --> 02:21:33,150
but some spray water somewhere else, is this what you're asking me?

2616
02:21:35,820 --> 02:21:37,590
OK, that's enough

2617
02:21:37,590 --> 02:21:40,090
That's enough, this is a waste of time

2618
02:21:40,090 --> 02:21:40,960
Yeah

2619
02:21:40,960 --> 02:21:42,560
That's enough, Tanaka

2620
02:21:48,430 --> 02:21:49,500
Huh, he's laughing

2621
02:21:50,100 --> 02:21:51,100
What's so funny?

2622
02:21:51,100 --> 02:21:53,500
You know, if you laugh, you're OUT, right?

2623
02:22:09,090 --> 02:22:10,790
That's enough!

2624
02:22:16,330 --> 02:22:18,100
None of you knew, right?

2625
02:22:18,100 --> 02:22:20,800
That isn't the real Tanaka!

2626
02:22:23,600 --> 02:22:25,540
I'm not the real Tanaka!

2627
02:22:26,170 --> 02:22:28,410
I tricked all of you members!!

2628
02:22:29,610 --> 02:22:30,980
Why "Members"?

2629
02:22:31,010 --> 02:22:34,140
This is a professional, amazing right?

2630
02:22:34,750 --> 02:22:36,210
I wonder if he's a professional

2631
02:22:36,210 --> 02:22:37,480
Shall we go?

2632
02:22:37,980 --> 02:22:40,720
How about teaching us a little about disguise?

2633
02:22:40,720 --> 02:22:41,350
Yeah

2634
02:22:43,150 --> 02:22:45,360
So, it was Tanaka who tricked us, right?

2635
02:22:45,460 --> 02:22:47,990
Maybe they kidnapped him or something

2636
02:22:47,390 --> 02:22:49,390
Right, in the restroom?

2637
02:22:49,390 --> 02:22:49,830
Yes

2638
02:22:50,160 --> 02:22:53,630
So if I went to the bathroom, they could nab me

2639
02:22:54,130 --> 02:22:56,900
and a fake Matsumoto would appear

2640
02:22:57,600 --> 02:23:00,240
That's scary!

2641
02:23:03,740 --> 02:23:06,140
Here comes another impersonator

2642
02:23:06,160 --> 02:23:11,280
So I was in the bathroom and the"fake me" took me away

2643
02:23:13,450 --> 02:23:18,190
I was thinking you were playing a trick on us

2644
02:23:18,290 --> 02:23:20,190
No, I was taking a leak...

2645
02:23:19,960 --> 02:23:21,490
You ARE Tanaka, right?

2646
02:23:22,230 --> 02:23:24,360
I'm Tanaka!

2647
02:23:24,360 --> 02:23:26,730
Share some shark knowledge with us

2648
02:23:26,730 --> 02:23:34,100
There are over 500 species of sharks and half of them live in the deep sea

2649
02:23:34,610 --> 02:23:36,110
Definitely Tanaka

2650
02:23:36,230 --> 02:23:37,310
I caught a glimpse of him

2651
02:23:37,310 --> 02:23:39,140
He looked just like me, didn't he?

2652
02:23:39,140 --> 02:23:39,740
Yeah

2653
02:23:40,190 --> 02:23:41,570
Fart!

2654
02:23:51,360 --> 02:23:55,930
I think you better go get a check up

2655
02:23:56,530 --> 02:23:58,130
Huh? Who are we talking about?

2656
02:23:58,130 --> 02:24:01,030
Me?

2657
02:23:59,360 --> 02:24:01,030
Why?

2658
02:24:04,900 --> 02:24:06,970
Stop making that face!

2659
02:24:07,770 --> 02:24:10,340
I told you to stop making that chimpanzee face

2660
02:24:14,950 --> 02:24:16,110
You can hit him harder

2661
02:24:17,350 --> 02:24:18,650
No, but seriously...

2662
02:24:19,020 --> 02:24:22,720
I started get grossed out over time...

2663
02:24:23,350 --> 02:24:24,090
By his farting?

2664
02:24:24,960 --> 02:24:28,180
If we all had same amount of farting in our life time,

2665
02:24:28,180 --> 02:24:35,070
he's farted to enough to clean our all of our fart savings

2666
02:24:35,070 --> 02:24:37,170
Like about 10 times a day?

2667
02:24:36,230 --> 02:24:37,670
No no no no

2668
02:24:37,670 --> 02:24:40,400
More than... PL's annual fireworks festival, right?

2669
02:24:40,400 --> 02:24:45,380
So that's about 40,000 fireworks, right?

2670
02:24:53,250 --> 02:24:55,620
It takes awhile to come to an end

2671
02:24:56,720 --> 02:24:58,020
It never ends

2672
02:25:01,260 --> 02:25:04,700
Wow, this time it was a good hit!

2673
02:25:03,530 --> 02:25:04,800
Yeah, that hurt!

2674
02:25:05,100 --> 02:25:07,930
Sometimes, it stinks pretty bad

2675
02:25:07,930 --> 02:25:11,500
and when we say, "it stinks", he gets so happy, right?

2676
02:25:14,710 --> 02:25:16,370
Oh, you laughed just then

2677
02:25:18,840 --> 02:25:21,510
Good

2678
02:25:19,310 --> 02:25:21,510
Good

2679
02:25:20,140 --> 02:25:21,510
Hit hard

2680
02:25:20,810 --> 02:25:21,510
Hit hard

2681
02:25:24,380 --> 02:25:26,180
That looked painful

2682
02:25:26,180 --> 02:25:27,050
Yes, keep that up!

2683
02:25:38,730 --> 02:25:39,750
What?!

2684
02:25:40,280 --> 02:25:42,900
I just cleared my throat

2685
02:25:43,200 --> 02:25:45,200
OK, this is how you wanna play?

2686
02:25:46,300 --> 02:25:48,670
Wow! That looked painful!

2687
02:25:48,840 --> 02:25:50,110
Painful

2688
02:25:52,340 --> 02:25:54,010
I'd say that's the baseline for hitting

2689
02:25:54,010 --> 02:25:56,910
That was harsh

2690
02:25:57,980 --> 02:26:00,320
He's walking like Michael Jackson

2691
02:26:00,520 --> 02:26:03,820
Looks like the mask Itao would wear!!

2692
02:26:09,260 --> 02:26:10,790
He laughed too!

2693
02:26:14,130 --> 02:26:16,870
Hit him hard!

2694
02:26:14,970 --> 02:26:16,800
Hit him hard!

2695
02:26:15,900 --> 02:26:16,870
Hit him hard!

2696
02:26:16,870 --> 02:26:18,370
Go easy, go easy

2697
02:26:20,700 --> 02:26:21,970
It hurts, hurts!

2698
02:26:24,610 --> 02:26:25,680
That hurts

2699
02:26:25,680 --> 02:26:29,880
Seems like the hits are getting stronger and stronger!

2700
02:26:31,830 --> 02:26:33,700
It's been 9 hours since training started

2701
02:26:34,630 --> 02:26:39,510
They entertain themselves during down time

2702
02:26:40,240 --> 02:26:43,410
Endo, let's go smoke

2703
02:26:47,960 --> 02:26:52,370
They head to the smoking area

2704
02:26:52,840 --> 02:26:57,910
Smoking area

2705
02:26:56,470 --> 02:26:59,410
We couldn't see who it was from behind

2706
02:26:57,110 --> 02:26:58,640
Who's she?

2707
02:26:59,540 --> 02:27:02,950
Rie Shibata With No Make Up

2708
02:27:14,690 --> 02:27:15,600
That's harsh

2709
02:27:15,620 --> 02:27:16,830
It really is

2710
02:27:16,960 --> 02:27:18,230
They're not here

2711
02:27:18,400 --> 02:27:22,570
The Punishers Went to the Wrong Room

2712
02:27:28,300 --> 02:27:31,780
What are you doing?

2713
02:27:31,780 --> 02:27:33,680
Look what she's got on today

2714
02:27:35,350 --> 02:27:36,380
She didn't say a word

2715
02:27:35,780 --> 02:27:37,180
Can I borrow your lighter?

2716
02:27:40,920 --> 02:27:41,990
Zap!

2717
02:27:40,980 --> 02:27:42,050
OUCH!

2718
02:27:43,690 --> 02:27:48,160
Shock Lighter

2719
02:27:50,860 --> 02:27:53,630
This is too much!

2720
02:27:54,300 --> 02:27:56,270
It's telling you to quit smoking

2721
02:27:58,940 --> 02:28:02,810
That's another reason you shouldn't smoke

2722
02:28:03,340 --> 02:28:05,540
They're getting hit continuously

2723
02:28:08,880 --> 02:28:10,310
Wow, she didn't speak

2724
02:28:08,910 --> 02:28:11,680
She didn't say a word

2725
02:28:10,750 --> 02:28:12,150
She didn't say a word

2726
02:28:12,680 --> 02:28:15,220
Good night

2727
02:28:15,220 --> 02:28:17,330
She came here just for this?

2728
02:28:17,730 --> 02:28:18,990
Yes, I guess so

2729
02:28:21,260 --> 02:28:22,730
How annoying

2730
02:28:22,730 --> 02:28:25,630
She had ZERO makeup on!!

2731
02:28:31,570 --> 02:28:33,070
Was everything OK?

2732
02:28:33,600 --> 02:28:35,260
When we entered...

2733
02:28:35,410 --> 02:28:37,340
someone was smoking

2734
02:28:37,610 --> 02:28:39,610
An old woman was smoking

2735
02:28:39,810 --> 02:28:42,750
When I saw her, it was Ms. Shibata with no make up

2736
02:28:44,150 --> 02:28:44,880
No makeup

2737
02:28:45,480 --> 02:28:49,120
Yeah, that would be funny

2738
02:28:49,120 --> 02:28:51,620
She was wearing an apron and unfashionable clothes

2739
02:28:52,390 --> 02:28:54,960
There's no place to rest

2740
02:28:55,690 --> 02:28:57,490
No place to run

2741
02:29:02,630 --> 02:29:06,900
Dangerous

2742
02:29:02,630 --> 02:29:06,900
Mission

2743
02:29:02,770 --> 02:29:06,800
The spies are headed for a dangerous mission

2744
02:29:04,330 --> 02:29:06,900
Spy

2745
02:29:06,900 --> 02:29:11,310
Main Spy office

2746
02:29:07,400 --> 02:29:12,380
Phone calls are routed here from spies all over the world

2747
02:29:16,380 --> 02:29:22,090
Charismatic Receptionists

2748
02:29:16,380 --> 02:29:22,090
Taking care of phone calls from around the world

2749
02:29:16,650 --> 02:29:21,150
Charismatic Receptionists take calls

2750
02:29:18,650 --> 02:29:19,650
Not again...

2751
02:29:20,520 --> 02:29:22,220
He's in this for sure

2752
02:29:22,620 --> 02:29:25,050
Jennifer-san

2753
02:29:22,620 --> 02:29:25,050
Nancy-san

2754
02:29:22,990 --> 02:29:25,920
These two have agreed to assist as well as....

2755
02:29:26,660 --> 02:29:28,590
Here he comes

2756
02:29:27,120 --> 02:29:30,060
Onishi Hideko-san

2757
02:29:30,630 --> 02:29:34,430
Assassins Appear!!

2758
02:29:30,630 --> 02:29:34,430
Laughing Hell

2759
02:29:31,290 --> 02:29:33,260
Assassins appear one after another

2760
02:29:38,300 --> 02:29:41,840
A Monster Shows Up

2761
02:29:38,500 --> 02:29:40,100
The monster unveils itself

2762
02:29:42,370 --> 02:29:44,810
Dream Match Up

2763
02:29:42,640 --> 02:29:44,410
A dream match-up

2764
02:29:48,480 --> 02:29:49,810
Shivering in Terror

2765
02:29:50,210 --> 02:29:53,460
Shiver in Terror

2766
02:29:53,890 --> 02:29:56,830
As the Game Intensifies

2767
02:29:53,890 --> 02:29:56,830
So Do the Shrieking Cries~!!

2768
02:29:56,830 --> 02:29:59,060
Give me a break!!

2769
02:30:05,030 --> 02:30:08,910
Mission

2770
02:30:05,030 --> 02:30:08,910
Risky

2771
02:30:05,610 --> 02:30:07,000
Spies risk their lives

2772
02:30:06,330 --> 02:30:08,910
Spy

2773
02:30:07,000 --> 02:30:08,880
on a daily basis to accomplish their missions

2774
02:30:08,910 --> 02:30:13,380
Spy Headquarters

2775
02:30:09,360 --> 02:30:14,220
Headquarters never stops getting calls regarding their spies

2776
02:30:17,830 --> 02:30:24,790
takes unique phone handling skills

2777
02:30:18,080 --> 02:30:24,790
Handling calls from all over the world

2778
02:30:25,290 --> 02:30:30,560
The following is a recording of their typical day

2779
02:30:31,160 --> 02:30:33,660
Jennifer-san

2780
02:30:31,160 --> 02:30:33,660
Nancy-san

2781
02:30:31,520 --> 02:30:34,320
They have agreed to participate in this recording

2782
02:30:35,630 --> 02:30:39,500
And this is Hideko Ohnishi

2783
02:30:43,820 --> 02:30:47,640
Hello, this is Spy Headquarters
How may I help you?

2784
02:30:49,310 --> 02:30:51,890
I hired one of your spies

2785
02:30:51,890 --> 02:30:54,440
But his service has been terrible

2786
02:30:55,250 --> 02:30:57,710
OK! Well....I....

2787
02:30:57,760 --> 02:30:58,420
Well...

2788
02:30:58,420 --> 02:31:01,660
I'm feeling very bad and...

2789
02:31:01,660 --> 02:31:02,890
feeling bad about...

2790
02:31:02,890 --> 02:31:05,000
Well....I'm feeling...

2791
02:31:05,000 --> 02:31:07,770
Well, that's the feeling I'm feeling

2792
02:31:08,040 --> 02:31:11,600
I need a formal apology!

2793
02:31:09,600 --> 02:31:11,600
Yes!

2794
02:31:13,700 --> 02:31:19,780
Fortunately, we're blessed with such a nice day

2795
02:31:19,780 --> 02:31:23,500
And very lively

2796
02:31:29,980 --> 02:31:31,600
Why "lively?"

2797
02:31:35,940 --> 02:31:37,360
Hell has arrived

2798
02:31:38,100 --> 02:31:44,370
Fortunately, we're blessed with such a nice day

2799
02:31:44,370 --> 02:31:48,170
And very lively

2800
02:31:48,170 --> 02:31:56,010
Ah, as I ask you to refer to the...

2801
02:31:56,010 --> 02:32:00,250
And my whole family couldn't be happier

2802
02:32:00,450 --> 02:32:03,990
Don't mess with me!

2803
02:32:03,990 --> 02:32:05,790
I'm sorry, please don't get mad

2804
02:32:05,790 --> 02:32:11,000
I have....I haven't studied at the college level...

2805
02:32:18,890 --> 02:32:19,480
Wait

2806
02:32:19,480 --> 02:32:21,290
Wait a sec

2807
02:32:22,270 --> 02:32:24,740
You got my thigh!

2808
02:32:26,380 --> 02:32:28,150
Can we finish this quickly?

2809
02:32:28,550 --> 02:32:33,320
I used to play baseball in high school

2810
02:32:33,320 --> 02:32:37,790
And I would stay until sundown to play ball, day after day

2811
02:32:38,090 --> 02:32:43,330
So I more or less neglected studying

2812
02:32:43,330 --> 02:32:47,260
And ended up learning only five subjects

2813
02:32:48,030 --> 02:32:50,200
I've heard enough!

2814
02:32:49,480 --> 02:32:53,950
I see, thank you for the call

2815
02:32:57,450 --> 02:33:01,410
Every call is different, aren't they?

2816
02:33:09,990 --> 02:33:13,460
Somebody

2817
02:33:18,250 --> 02:33:22,380
Hello, this is Spy Headquarters

2818
02:33:22,380 --> 02:33:23,860
What are you inquiring about today?

2819
02:33:24,160 --> 02:33:26,140
I'm US Spy 002

2820
02:33:26,480 --> 02:33:29,070
Where are we with the "Mission:Impossible" case?

2821
02:33:28,110 --> 02:33:29,070
Huh?

2822
02:33:29,070 --> 02:33:34,110
Where do we stand on the "Mission:Impossible" case?

2823
02:33:31,310 --> 02:33:34,110
Passhibu~?

2824
02:33:35,480 --> 02:33:39,120
Misshioni~ Posshibu~??

2825
02:33:49,920 --> 02:33:53,190
I thought I made it through

2826
02:33:55,290 --> 02:33:56,280
I like it

2827
02:33:56,540 --> 02:33:57,450
That's good

2828
02:34:05,440 --> 02:34:08,580
I'm Japanese Spy 0010

2829
02:34:08,590 --> 02:34:10,240
0010?

2830
02:34:11,120 --> 02:34:14,120
Teach me how the Spy Theme song goes

2831
02:34:14,620 --> 02:34:17,790
Spy Theme Song?

2832
02:34:17,790 --> 02:34:20,420
Well...

2833
02:34:23,440 --> 02:34:25,630
Chitty Chitty Bang Bang

2834
02:34:25,630 --> 02:34:28,070
Chitty Chitty Bang Bang

2835
02:34:29,130 --> 02:34:30,260
Chitty Chitty Bang Bang

2836
02:34:30,260 --> 02:34:31,950
Bang Bang Bang

2837
02:34:32,740 --> 02:34:35,470
And that's the song for the...

2838
02:34:35,620 --> 02:34:37,500
Where's the rest?

2839
02:34:37,790 --> 02:34:39,540
Ah! Chitty Chitty! Chitty Chitty!

2840
02:34:39,540 --> 02:34:40,660
Chitty Chitty Bang Bang

2841
02:34:40,700 --> 02:34:41,630
Chitty Chitty Bang Bang

2842
02:34:41,680 --> 02:34:42,680
Chitty Chitty Bang Bang

2843
02:34:42,760 --> 02:34:44,030
Bang Bang Bang

2844
02:34:44,060 --> 02:34:45,250
Bang Bang

2845
02:34:45,270 --> 02:34:46,330
Chitty Chitty Bang Bang

2846
02:34:46,360 --> 02:34:48,240
Chitty Chitty Bang Bang

2847
02:34:48,290 --> 02:34:49,450
Chitty Chitty Bang Bang

2848
02:34:49,480 --> 02:34:50,690
Bang Bang

2849
02:34:50,720 --> 02:34:51,990
Bang Bang

2850
02:34:52,020 --> 02:34:53,130
Chitty Chitty Bang Bang

2851
02:34:53,180 --> 02:34:54,110
Chitty Chitty Bang Bang

2852
02:34:54,130 --> 02:34:55,190
Bang Bang Bang

2853
02:34:55,300 --> 02:34:56,750
Bang Bang

2854
02:34:56,830 --> 02:34:57,810
Chitty Chitty Bang Bang

2855
02:34:57,810 --> 02:34:58,860
Bang Bang Bang

2856
02:34:58,890 --> 02:35:00,190
Bang Bang

2857
02:35:00,190 --> 02:35:01,320
Chitty Chitty Bang Bang

2858
02:35:01,350 --> 02:35:02,210
Chitty Chitty Bang Bang

2859
02:35:02,280 --> 02:35:03,380
Chitty Chitty Bang Bang

2860
02:35:03,390 --> 02:35:04,440
Bang Bang Bang

2861
02:35:04,470 --> 02:35:05,750
Bang Bang

2862
02:35:05,820 --> 02:35:06,770
Twinkle Twinkle

2863
02:35:06,820 --> 02:35:07,720
Twinkle Twinkle

2864
02:35:07,750 --> 02:35:08,810
Twinkle Twinkle

2865
02:35:08,890 --> 02:35:10,210
Pah Pah Pah!

2866
02:35:10,560 --> 02:35:11,100
Yeah

2867
02:35:11,100 --> 02:35:13,080
Yeah, No, stop it

2868
02:35:13,190 --> 02:35:15,070
Yea, Yea, Yea

2869
02:35:15,150 --> 02:35:15,790
Yeah

2870
02:35:15,840 --> 02:35:17,240
Yea, yea, yea

2871
02:35:17,270 --> 02:35:18,800
Yea, yea, Yea

2872
02:35:18,880 --> 02:35:20,520
Yea, yea, yea

2873
02:35:20,550 --> 02:35:21,250
Yeah, yea, yea

2874
02:35:21,290 --> 02:35:22,410
Yeah, yea, yea

2875
02:35:22,450 --> 02:35:23,930
Yeah, yea, yo

2876
02:35:23,970 --> 02:35:25,380
Swish, swish

2877
02:35:25,380 --> 02:35:26,600
Swich, swish, swish

2878
02:35:26,600 --> 02:35:27,960
Swish, swish, swish

2879
02:35:27,960 --> 02:35:29,570
Swish

2880
02:35:29,900 --> 02:35:31,040
Swish, swish, swish

2881
02:35:31,200 --> 02:35:33,450
Swish, Peg, gah, pekkuri

2882
02:35:33,530 --> 02:35:34,710
Swish, swish

2883
02:35:34,770 --> 02:35:36,190
Swish, swish, swish

2884
02:35:36,190 --> 02:35:37,260
Swish, swish, swish

2885
02:35:37,260 --> 02:35:38,250
Sattan-ra

2886
02:35:38,750 --> 02:35:39,780
Swish, swish

2887
02:35:39,860 --> 02:35:41,250
Swish, swish, swish

2888
02:35:41,310 --> 02:35:42,440
Swish, swish

2889
02:35:42,480 --> 02:35:43,430
Swish, swish

2890
02:35:43,430 --> 02:35:45,080
Swish, swish

2891
02:35:45,080 --> 02:35:47,230
Hi-ra-ri

2892
02:35:48,820 --> 02:35:52,200
And that's the end...

2893
02:35:56,760 --> 02:35:58,300
Alright, I made it through

2894
02:35:58,380 --> 02:36:00,390
My butt hurts

2895
02:36:05,190 --> 02:36:08,190
There's been more than 10 hours of training

2896
02:36:12,300 --> 02:36:15,830
The spy occupation carries certain labels such as

2897
02:36:15,830 --> 02:36:18,940
"scary", "hard", or "mean"

2898
02:36:18,940 --> 02:36:24,210
But the opposite is true...it's a fun occupation....I believe

2899
02:36:24,210 --> 02:36:28,020
And they're holding a show just to prove that point

2900
02:36:28,020 --> 02:36:29,390
And we're invited to attend it

2901
02:36:28,660 --> 02:36:29,750
A show??

2902
02:36:29,580 --> 02:36:36,890
Improve the Spy's Bad Image

2903
02:36:29,580 --> 02:36:36,890
Observe the Image Improvement Show

2904
02:36:38,160 --> 02:36:41,360
I didn't think spies had such a bad rap

2905
02:36:42,900 --> 02:36:46,600
I've got a bad feeling about this show

2906
02:36:49,300 --> 02:36:50,830
I hate walking through here

2907
02:36:56,310 --> 02:36:57,430
Here we are

2908
02:37:02,040 --> 02:37:03,620
Look at all these people

2909
02:37:10,130 --> 02:37:11,140
Have a seat in order

2910
02:37:15,490 --> 02:37:17,440
Enjoy the show, guys!

2911
02:37:21,090 --> 02:37:21,820
My ass hurts

2912
02:37:22,340 --> 02:37:30,100
The following play titled "The Return of Wanderer" was organized by the GIA theater group

2913
02:37:29,880 --> 02:37:32,820
This has nothing to do with spies

2914
02:37:30,100 --> 02:37:32,820
Enjoy the show

2915
02:37:39,240 --> 02:37:41,240
You know what?

2916
02:37:40,290 --> 02:37:45,600
Konya Ga Yamada

2917
02:37:40,290 --> 02:37:45,600
Lossy

2918
02:37:40,290 --> 02:37:45,600
Wild Bomb

2919
02:37:41,240 --> 02:37:43,190
That's a good Udon noodle, isn't it?

2920
02:37:43,190 --> 02:37:44,570
Konya Ga Yamada

2921
02:37:44,570 --> 02:37:45,880
You're not kidding

2922
02:37:45,980 --> 02:37:48,580
That was a big lunch, but what's your favorite?

2923
02:37:48,580 --> 02:37:49,940
Konya Ga Yamada

2924
02:37:51,550 --> 02:37:52,430
Konya Ga Yamada

2925
02:37:52,430 --> 02:37:53,520
And you got Beef Bowl

2926
02:37:53,520 --> 02:37:54,780
Konya Ga Yamada

2927
02:37:54,780 --> 02:37:55,760
And the Soba noodle

2928
02:37:55,740 --> 02:37:56,910
Konya Ga...

2929
02:37:56,820 --> 02:37:58,720
How much is enough?

2930
02:37:58,760 --> 02:38:00,000
That's way too much

2931
02:38:00,020 --> 02:38:00,970
You need some help

2932
02:38:01,420 --> 02:38:03,530
Excuse me, more water, please?

2933
02:38:06,550 --> 02:38:11,220
Takayuki Kinoshita

2934
02:38:07,720 --> 02:38:10,130
Excuse me

2935
02:38:11,250 --> 02:38:13,370
I love your Udon noodles

2936
02:38:13,370 --> 02:38:17,430
Just looking at this place, you would never know

2937
02:38:17,500 --> 02:38:19,390
But now I know

2938
02:38:19,390 --> 02:38:20,230
Thank you so much

2939
02:38:20,230 --> 02:38:25,440
Anyhow, I finally saved enough money to make some renovations to the restaurant

2940
02:38:24,940 --> 02:38:26,530
Are you the only worker here?

2941
02:38:26,530 --> 02:38:28,760
I have two other siblings

2942
02:38:28,760 --> 02:38:32,200
Although, last I heard, my brother's been wandering around the country like a bum

2943
02:38:32,580 --> 02:38:36,450
But my sister does a fine job helping the restaurant

2944
02:38:35,590 --> 02:38:36,440
A younger sister?

2945
02:38:37,890 --> 02:38:39,030
Yes, she's a cutie

2946
02:38:39,030 --> 02:38:40,760
Did you get that?

2947
02:38:40,760 --> 02:38:44,340
Could you introduce her to us single guys then?

2948
02:38:43,760 --> 02:38:45,110
I don't know about that

2949
02:38:50,590 --> 02:38:54,160
Bibari Maeda

2950
02:38:54,180 --> 02:38:55,470
I'm home!!

2951
02:38:56,800 --> 02:38:57,820
Sorry about that

2952
02:38:57,820 --> 02:38:59,180
Welcome back, Bibari

2953
02:38:59,180 --> 02:39:00,710
Thank you

2954
02:39:00,710 --> 02:39:03,530
So she's your sister then?

2955
02:39:04,280 --> 02:39:05,680
What an old hag!

2956
02:39:06,550 --> 02:39:08,250
What did you say?

2957
02:39:11,050 --> 02:39:18,120
The cast gets to enjoy this part of the show without punishment

2958
02:39:11,640 --> 02:39:13,720
You can't treat the customers like this!

2959
02:39:13,720 --> 02:39:15,040
What's going on here?

2960
02:39:15,040 --> 02:39:16,830
Please come again!

2961
02:39:16,830 --> 02:39:17,490
Thank you!

2962
02:39:17,490 --> 02:39:20,510
Say Bibari, how come the delivery took so long?

2963
02:39:20,510 --> 02:39:22,630
Sorry about that, brother

2964
02:39:22,630 --> 02:39:25,940
Store owners wouldn't let me go

2965
02:39:25,940 --> 02:39:27,290
Again?

2966
02:39:27,310 --> 02:39:29,700
You better get married soon

2967
02:39:35,680 --> 02:39:38,020
Let me just invite myself inside

2968
02:39:37,010 --> 02:39:38,640

02:39:41,070 --> 02:39:42,800
He's someone who wouldn't let her go

2971
02:39:42,750 --> 02:39:46,620
Panzetta Girolamo

2972
02:39:43,090 --> 02:39:44,350
He says he likes me

2973
02:39:44,370 --> 02:39:45,200
Is that so?

2974
02:39:45,180 --> 02:39:47,230
Are you Girolamo-san from Italy?

2975
02:39:47,230 --> 02:39:49,360
Well, that aside,

2976
02:39:49,980 --> 02:39:51,510
Would you ask me what my hobby is?

2977
02:39:51,590 --> 02:39:52,090
Your hobby?

2978
02:39:52,350 --> 02:39:55,710
The act of making women orgasm!

2979
02:39:55,710 --> 02:39:57,650
Yes, they keep coming!

2980
02:39:57,650 --> 02:39:59,670
All you think about is women, right?

2981
02:39:58,880 --> 02:40:00,340
Yeah...

2982
02:40:00,340 --> 02:40:02,340
He's just like "Yeah"

2983
02:40:03,800 --> 02:40:06,760
Damn, here comes another guest

2984
02:40:06,380 --> 02:40:07,490
What's this all about?

2985
02:40:07,490 --> 02:40:10,480
Sorry for being late, and sorry for oh my...my bad

2986
02:40:11,120 --> 02:40:14,210
This is another guy who wouldn't leave me be!

2987
02:40:14,260 --> 02:40:15,250
Is that so?

2988
02:40:15,240 --> 02:40:17,730
You're only after her body though, right?

2989
02:40:15,250 --> 02:40:20,660
Mr. Marikku

2990
02:40:17,990 --> 02:40:20,210
It's not that at all

2991
02:40:20,270 --> 02:40:23,490
Her and I are destined to be together

2992
02:40:23,840 --> 02:40:27,770
Here, take a look at this as my proof

2993
02:40:31,620 --> 02:40:33,130
That's your famous "Hand Power"

2994
02:40:33,130 --> 02:40:34,750
So you are only after her body!

2995
02:40:34,750 --> 02:40:38,110
There is also another man who keeps bugging me...

2996
02:40:38,110 --> 02:40:40,110
and he's always touching his balls

2997
02:40:40,110 --> 02:40:42,410
A man who's always touching his balls?

2998
02:40:54,500 --> 02:40:58,920
There is also another man who keeps bugging me...

2999
02:40:58,920 --> 02:41:00,980

3000
02:41:01,360 --> 02:41:03,160
A man who's always touching his balls?

3001
02:41:10,870 --> 02:41:11,910
Excuse me

3002
02:41:10,960 --> 02:41:18,960
Note: He's pretending to be talking to somebody

3003
02:41:11,940 --> 02:41:13,370
"Who are you?"

3004
02:41:13,420 --> 02:41:15,400

02:41:15,400 --> 02:41:16,730

What's the problem?

There's a good chance that someone might have dine-and-dash...

3047
02:42:40,660 --> 02:42:45,910
I'm afraid both of your stores might be targeted as well...

3135
02:46:57,490 --> 02:46:58,890
My God...

3136
02:46:58,890 --> 02:47:01,910
I can no longer just let you guys do whatever the hell you want!!

3137
02:47:01,910 --> 02:47:04,250
Listen, Itoh!!

3138
02:47:04,250 --> 02:47:08,330
I don't care if you're ETC or ELT, but you're voice is like a friggen ghost!

3139
02:47:08,330 --> 02:47:11,010
Put some freaking life into it!!!

3140
02:47:11,060 --> 02:47:13,010
Speaking of life...

3141
02:47:13,010 --> 02:47:18,610
Nice job on building that disgusting looking house!

3142
02:47:18,630 --> 02:47:21,070
You're giving me the creeps, idiot!!

3143
02:47:21,470 --> 02:47:22,270
Hey

3144
02:47:22,270 --> 02:47:23,620
You, Tanaka!

3145
02:47:23,700 --> 02:47:26,900
Get over here, you're not safe either!

3146
02:47:24,940 --> 02:47:26,950
Mah-kun

3147
02:47:31,800 --> 02:47:34,030
What's this I hear about your special treatment?

3148
02:47:34,030 --> 02:47:37,210
While all your teammates report to the club at noon

3149
02:47:37,210 --> 02:47:39,930
You don't even have to report until 4pm??

3150
02:47:39,930 --> 02:47:43,040
You think you're some kind of big time celebrity?

3151
02:47:43,040 --> 02:47:45,820
Who do you think you are?!!

3152
02:47:45,820 --> 02:47:48,010
You're virtually a mute who don't even train anymore

3153
02:47:48,070 --> 02:47:50,080
Nukumizu who's been rehearsing since the dawn

3154
02:47:50,140 --> 02:47:52,910
only makes 1/10 of your salary!!

3155
02:47:53,140 --> 02:47:58,120
Just because you have a descent fast-ball doesn't mean shit to me!

3156
02:47:58,120 --> 02:48:01,630
Ah, I was so scared!

3157
02:48:05,970 --> 02:48:07,160
Intermission?

3158
02:48:07,710 --> 02:48:09,380
An intermission?

3159
02:48:09,380 --> 02:48:11,390
Wasn't that it?

3160
02:48:13,000 --> 02:48:15,340
I believe there's still more

3161
02:48:15,340 --> 02:48:17,880
Since there was no resolutions...

3162
02:48:17,880 --> 02:48:19,620
I'd say that was a good ending

3163
02:48:22,080 --> 02:48:27,660
Stage Assistant in Black is Standing By

3164
02:48:25,430 --> 02:48:27,810
Hey, did everything go OK?

3165
02:48:27,950 --> 02:48:30,270
I went around to pay off and apologize

3166
02:48:30,980 --> 02:48:33,260
That sound like a handful

3167
02:48:32,150 --> 02:48:33,870
You put me up to this!

3168
02:48:33,870 --> 02:48:35,960
But more importantly,

3169
02:48:35,980 --> 02:48:38,890
How did you end up with such a debt?

3170
02:48:36,430 --> 02:48:38,760
Her eyes are as good as dead

3171
02:48:38,890 --> 02:48:40,700
Well...

3172
02:48:40,700 --> 02:48:43,940
My friend was in financial trouble

3173
02:48:44,020 --> 02:48:47,350
and he made me a co-signer without my consent

3174
02:48:47,350 --> 02:48:48,700
Unfortunately, he's nowhere to be found

3175
02:48:48,700 --> 02:48:50,150
That's illegal

3176
02:48:50,150 --> 02:48:51,930
Well, the loan document says otherwise...

3177
02:48:55,600 --> 02:48:56,820
It's them again

3178
02:48:59,210 --> 02:49:01,540
Oh, here's the hero of the day

3179
02:49:02,460 --> 02:49:04,460
Let's see he can still work the wonder

3180
02:49:04,700 --> 02:49:06,590
Brother!

3181
02:49:10,840 --> 02:49:14,010
I had forgotten about him

3182
02:49:12,530 --> 02:49:14,040
Ah, it is him

3183
02:49:16,900 --> 02:49:21,960
Piccadilly Umeda

3184
02:49:22,080 --> 02:49:24,310
Um...don't mind me stepping in

3185
02:49:24,470 --> 02:49:26,060
Go home if you got nothing to do

3186
02:49:27,010 --> 02:49:30,450
Well, why don't I take her as collateral then?

3187
02:49:32,810 --> 02:49:35,180
Hold up

3188
02:49:36,650 --> 02:49:37,890
What the hell..??

3189
02:49:40,800 --> 02:49:42,500
I'm ready when you are!

3190
02:49:45,530 --> 02:49:48,330
It's the stinky one...

3191
02:49:51,230 --> 02:49:52,510
This is too much

3192
02:49:52,720 --> 02:49:54,670
Meow~

3193
02:49:54,670 --> 02:49:55,650
Meow~

3194
02:49:56,640 --> 02:49:57,440
Meow~

3195
02:50:16,410 --> 02:50:18,410
How long are you going to keep doing this?

3196
02:50:19,420 --> 02:50:20,980
Let's ditch this place, huh?

3197
02:50:27,820 --> 02:50:29,450
So everyone's involved?

3198
02:50:33,930 --> 02:50:35,200
Get'em!!

3199
02:50:36,130 --> 02:50:37,290
Get'em!!

3200
02:50:38,430 --> 02:50:39,460
Get'em!!

3201
02:50:40,700 --> 02:50:42,130
Get'em!!

3202
02:50:42,330 --> 02:50:45,170
Ok, that's how it goes

3203
02:50:45,170 --> 02:50:47,470
How many more laps are they doing?

3204
02:50:47,470 --> 02:50:48,910
Amazing

3205
02:50:50,310 --> 02:50:51,310
Catch them!

3206
02:50:52,310 --> 02:50:54,650
Hey, catch them!

3207
02:50:55,080 --> 02:50:57,350
Hey, catch them...

3208
02:51:03,190 --> 02:51:07,230
I'm dyin @#$$@$%

3209
02:51:12,330 --> 02:51:14,500
Sounds like you really are ready to die, huh?

3210
02:51:18,500 --> 02:51:22,140
I have 5,000,000 yen here

3211
02:51:22,910 --> 02:51:24,980
Please take this and forgive us

3212
02:51:25,410 --> 02:51:29,780
That was to renovate our shop..

3213
02:51:30,650 --> 02:51:31,520
That's ok

3214
02:51:32,320 --> 02:51:35,920
My dream is that you stay happy

3215
02:51:37,960 --> 02:51:41,860
We can always make money again to renovate our shop

3216
02:51:42,560 --> 02:51:45,930
So this money is meant to be use now

3217
02:51:47,200 --> 02:51:50,670
Brother..

3218
02:51:48,700 --> 02:51:50,670
Brother

3219
02:51:52,170 --> 02:51:54,470
Brother!!

3220
02:51:52,670 --> 02:51:54,470
I'm not your brother!!

3221
02:51:58,180 --> 02:51:59,980
Give that to me

3222
02:52:00,810 --> 02:52:02,950
Wait

3223
02:52:02,950 --> 02:52:04,450
Something else again?

3224
02:52:06,450 --> 02:52:08,150
The voice is too soft

3225
02:52:08,150 --> 02:52:14,090
These guys are a fraud group that steals a lot of money

3226
02:52:14,530 --> 02:52:15,960
using fake IOUs

3227
02:52:16,290 --> 02:52:19,000
You don't have to give them money at all

3228
02:52:23,840 --> 02:52:26,470
That's

3229
02:52:24,540 --> 02:52:26,470
ALL!!

3230
02:52:27,710 --> 02:52:29,470
Brother!

3231
02:52:33,110 --> 02:52:35,410
My God

3232
02:52:34,180 --> 02:52:35,410
He's dead

3233
02:52:35,410 --> 02:52:36,300
That's fine

3234
02:52:36,300 --> 02:52:39,280
I'll take you guys to the police station

3235
02:52:39,280 --> 02:52:41,250
Brother, you don't have time to be dead

3236
02:52:42,990 --> 02:52:43,720
He's not dead

3237
02:52:43,390 --> 02:52:45,420
He is alive

3238
02:52:47,190 --> 02:52:50,230
Now you two can get married and our shop can be renovated

3239
02:52:50,230 --> 02:52:51,950
It's a win-win situation

3240
02:52:51,960 --> 02:52:52,500
Ahh

3241
02:52:53,930 --> 02:52:57,140
I'm gonna open pickles with this money

3242
02:52:57,970 --> 02:52:59,750
She meant to open up a pickles shop

3243
02:52:59,170 --> 02:53:01,570
We won't let you!

3244
02:53:17,260 --> 02:53:18,660
Everyone out

3245
02:53:18,660 --> 02:53:20,660
That's not the point

3246
02:53:21,760 --> 02:53:23,260
Why the hell we got OUT?

3247
02:53:26,900 --> 02:53:29,400
I'm fine with OUT

3248
02:53:30,800 --> 02:53:32,000
Ouch..

3249
02:53:32,300 --> 02:53:33,860
Did everyone enjoy it?

3250
02:53:33,880 --> 02:53:34,970
Shall we go?

3251
02:53:35,140 --> 02:53:37,980
Why does he ask that question?

3252
02:53:37,980 --> 02:53:40,050
This had nothing to do with spy

3253
02:53:41,880 --> 02:53:43,150
I'll go to the bathroom

3254
02:53:48,320 --> 02:53:51,060
I better go too

3255
02:53:59,760 --> 02:54:03,940
Buri Buri

3256
02:54:03,940 --> 02:54:08,940
Continuous farts

3257
02:54:11,840 --> 02:54:23,720
Taro Kida

3258
02:54:20,520 --> 02:54:23,720
Hey, I'm in the middle of peeing!!

3259
02:54:23,960 --> 02:54:25,260
Come on!

3260
02:54:25,260 --> 02:54:26,790
Surprised me

3261
02:54:28,330 --> 02:54:29,690
Can't be

3262
02:54:31,330 --> 02:54:33,730
Mr. Kida

3263
02:54:41,010 --> 02:54:42,120
Endo, you were  saved

3264
02:54:42,600 --> 02:54:44,140
Yes, I didn't see the moment

3265
02:54:45,880 --> 02:54:49,580
Give me a break

3266
02:54:45,900 --> 02:54:47,330
He's also the Japanese Mozart

3267
02:54:54,790 --> 02:55:00,190
Spy training 10 hours and 30 minutes

3268
02:54:54,790 --> 02:55:00,190
The assassin are even in the bathroom...

3269
02:54:54,890 --> 02:54:59,960
10 hours and 30 minutes since starting, the assassin are even in the bathroom...

3270
02:55:01,360 --> 02:55:08,500
5 men got no way out

3271
02:55:01,360 --> 02:55:08,500
The assassins are still coming

3272
02:55:01,590 --> 02:55:08,800
The assassins are continuously appearing to get the 5 men who have no way out

3273
02:55:09,770 --> 02:55:12,900
What the hell is waiting for us now?

3274
02:55:12,900 --> 02:55:15,970
That was handful, wasn't it?

3275
02:55:16,610 --> 02:55:22,110
We have the (Hamada) doll here

3276
02:55:17,510 --> 02:55:18,370
Yes

3277
02:55:19,710 --> 02:55:21,180
Yes, it is here

3278
02:55:21,180 --> 02:55:22,610
Hamada-san doll?

3279
02:55:22,750 --> 02:55:24,800
He will still appear in later clips but...

3280
02:55:30,190 --> 02:55:33,390
It's funny in any pose

3281
02:55:33,390 --> 02:55:34,670
Yea, it is

3282
02:55:34,540 --> 02:55:35,850
That's well made

3283
02:55:35,850 --> 02:55:37,550
Such a fashionable pose

3284
02:55:37,550 --> 02:55:40,190
Just some additional information,

3285
02:55:40,210 --> 02:55:42,110
this wasn't made in Japan

3286
02:55:41,000 --> 02:55:44,100
Kazuhiro Fujiwara

3287
02:55:41,000 --> 02:55:44,100
License

3288
02:55:41,000 --> 02:55:44,100
Takafumi Inomoto

3289
02:55:42,570 --> 02:55:43,870
It was made overseas

3290
02:55:44,570 --> 02:55:46,640
It was ordered from S. Korea

3291
02:55:46,640 --> 02:55:51,110
And it was made by someone who doesn't know Hamada-san

3292
02:55:51,110 --> 02:55:52,010
Amazing

3293
02:55:52,380 --> 02:55:54,210
And this isn't cheap, correct?

3294
02:55:54,210 --> 02:55:57,650
300,000 Yen (approx. $3,000 USD)

3295
02:55:57,650 --> 02:56:01,490
The real guy is worth about 180,000 Yen ($1,800 USD)

3296
02:56:00,190 --> 02:56:01,520
How cheap!?

3297
02:56:01,790 --> 02:56:02,550
Cheap!

3298
02:56:02,550 --> 02:56:04,190
You got a cheap price tag on you

3299
02:56:04,190 --> 02:56:06,190
Regardless, this is very well made

3300
02:56:06,260 --> 02:56:08,930
Shall we move on, Matsumoto-san?

3301
02:56:12,430 --> 02:56:14,830
NEXT!

3302
02:56:18,840 --> 02:56:22,110
Hey, what is this, really?

3303
02:56:24,830 --> 02:56:28,100
They are already past 10 hours and 30 minutes of Spy training

3304
02:56:28,860 --> 02:56:30,600
The 5 men have reached their limit

3305
02:56:32,030 --> 02:56:33,980
There are few words exchanged

3306
02:56:44,510 --> 02:56:49,450
2010 year-end special

3307
02:56:44,510 --> 02:56:49,450

3308
02:56:51,390 --> 02:56:56,420
The LDP Policy Chief ·The former Defense Minister

3309
02:56:51,390 --> 02:56:56,420
Shigeru Ishiba

3310
02:56:51,620 --> 02:56:53,120
Everyone, good evening

3311
02:56:53,310 --> 02:56:55,580
I am Shigeru Ishibashi, the former Defense Minister

3312
02:56:55,820 --> 02:57:01,760
This year, we had quite a lot of problems regarding military security

3313
02:57:02,500 --> 02:57:05,600
Today, we are going to discuss a theme of

3314
02:57:06,000 --> 02:57:09,140
"Protecting Japan from world danger"

3315
02:57:08,400 --> 02:57:11,240
Eh!? Seriously?

3316
02:57:09,840 --> 02:57:12,310
So let's invite today's guest

3317
02:57:12,740 --> 02:57:13,980
Great, isn't it?

3318
02:57:17,010 --> 02:57:18,480
Hideaki Onishi

3319
02:57:18,750 --> 02:57:24,290
Military commentator

3320
02:57:18,750 --> 02:57:24,290
Onishi Hideaki

3321
02:57:20,140 --> 02:57:21,350
Military commentator..

3322
02:57:21,360 --> 02:57:22,550
Thank you for coming today

3323
02:57:22,450 --> 02:57:23,180
My pleasure

3324
02:57:23,980 --> 02:57:24,850
Nice to meet you

3325
02:57:26,920 --> 02:57:28,190
Wow..

3326
02:57:29,720 --> 02:57:31,650
It's a pleasure to have you on board

3327
02:57:31,650 --> 02:57:33,260
Thank you so much

3328
02:57:33,260 --> 02:57:35,060
We have a lot of questions for you today

3329
02:57:35,110 --> 02:57:37,570
so please let us know your opinions

3330
02:57:38,230 --> 02:57:41,600
As we delve into the topic of national security,

3331
02:57:41,600 --> 02:57:44,100
we must first discuss about the weapons

3332
02:57:44,100 --> 02:57:45,950
whether it be an aircraft,

3333
02:57:45,950 --> 02:57:48,840
or military vessel

3334
02:57:48,840 --> 02:57:53,750
Otherwise, the discussion about national security would be a baseless one

3335
02:57:53,750 --> 02:57:56,050
But first, I have something for you

3336
02:57:56,160 --> 02:57:58,050
please take a look

3337
02:57:59,290 --> 02:58:03,290
Do you know what this is, Onishi-san?

3338
02:58:03,890 --> 02:58:04,330
Yes

3339
02:58:04,990 --> 02:58:09,300
Battleship Nagato

3340
02:58:05,060 --> 02:58:07,430
By the way, what is this ship called?

3341
02:58:08,500 --> 02:58:09,030
This?

3342
02:58:10,360 --> 02:58:11,100
This is..

3343
02:58:12,800 --> 02:58:13,370
Eh..

3344
02:58:14,970 --> 02:58:17,570
Battleship Asahi Newspaper

3345
02:58:17,910 --> 02:58:21,580
Ah...

3346
02:58:18,670 --> 02:58:21,580
is that so

3347
02:58:36,590 --> 02:58:37,190
Well...

3348
02:58:38,730 --> 02:58:40,900
Battleship Asahi newspaper

3349
02:58:41,660 --> 02:58:43,970
Ah...

3350
02:58:42,430 --> 02:58:43,970
Ok

3351
02:58:43,970 --> 02:58:45,500
You mean that...

3352
02:58:45,500 --> 02:58:47,770
What made you think so?

3353
02:58:47,770 --> 02:58:50,270
Because there is a Asahi Newspaper flag

3354
02:58:50,270 --> 02:58:52,370
Ok...

3355
02:58:52,770 --> 02:58:55,440
This is a flag for Imperial Japanese Navy

3356
02:58:55,810 --> 02:58:56,610
Oh..

3357
02:58:57,950 --> 02:58:59,080
Then..

3358
02:58:59,610 --> 02:59:05,590
I ask you what Japan should do for the world,

3359
02:59:05,720 --> 02:59:07,120
I'll get right to it

3360
02:59:07,260 --> 02:59:10,660
What do you think about PKO?

3361
02:59:13,230 --> 02:59:14,460
Eh..

3362
02:59:15,400 --> 02:59:17,270
Well...P...

3363
02:59:17,270 --> 02:59:25,570
Without

3364
02:59:19,030 --> 02:59:25,610
PKO...

3365
02:59:22,370 --> 02:59:25,570
games...

3366
02:59:23,770 --> 02:59:25,570
wont finish

3367
02:59:25,910 --> 02:59:28,540
Yes...

3368
02:59:27,510 --> 02:59:28,540
Yes

3369
02:59:28,540 --> 02:59:32,180
I think your answer got straight to the point, but

3370
02:59:32,180 --> 02:59:37,390
By the way, what does PKO stand for?

3371
02:59:38,450 --> 02:59:40,520
P-man (bell pepper)

3372
02:59:40,520 --> 02:59:42,460
Ketchup

3373
02:59:42,460 --> 02:59:45,730
Pi..

3374
02:59:43,020 --> 02:59:45,730
Pine

3375
02:59:52,920 --> 02:59:57,190
Jimmy's got an unfair advantage

3376
02:59:53,130 --> 02:59:55,100
He's totally clueless that Jimmy

3377
03:00:00,080 --> 03:00:03,370
Jimmy-san, this isn't fair

3378
03:00:03,370 --> 03:00:05,780
Let's move on to the next topic,

3379
03:00:05,780 --> 03:00:08,380
"Piracy in Somalia"

3380
03:00:08,460 --> 03:00:13,840
I would like your opinion on this issue

3381
03:00:14,300 --> 03:00:17,030
Well...

3382
03:00:17,440 --> 03:00:19,600
Gambling...

3383
03:00:20,070 --> 03:00:23,170
The officials are too involved in gambling to...

3384
03:00:23,760 --> 03:00:25,710
Well...Ah, yes...

3385
03:00:25,710 --> 03:00:27,910
As we're about to welcome the new year,

3386
03:00:28,090 --> 03:00:30,770
I'm expecting an honest and frank discussion

3387
03:00:30,980 --> 03:00:33,870
So please don't use this as an opportunity to joke around

3388
03:00:32,460 --> 03:00:33,780
No, I'm taking this seriously

3389
03:00:34,140 --> 03:00:37,620
Now, I hadn't heard anything about "gambling"

3390
03:00:37,890 --> 03:00:40,660
What is your source for this information?

3391
03:00:40,690 --> 03:00:41,700
Well...

3392
03:00:41,700 --> 03:00:42,710
I have

3393
03:00:42,710 --> 03:00:45,750
I heard it from the Prime Minister

3394
03:00:46,150 --> 03:00:50,830
By the way, who is our Prime Minister?

3395
03:00:51,500 --> 03:00:53,340
Kan Chokuto

3396
03:00:53,910 --> 03:00:56,680
I'm saying it with an accent though

3397
03:00:56,690 --> 03:01:01,850
Kan Chokuto

3398
03:01:00,440 --> 03:01:01,740
Out of control

3399
03:01:09,430 --> 03:01:10,490
"Chokuto"?

3400
03:01:10,660 --> 03:01:12,870
So he read his name as "Chokuto"

3401
03:01:19,800 --> 03:01:23,840
You're talking about Kan Naoto, are you not?

3402
03:01:24,340 --> 03:01:25,210
Who?

3403
03:01:25,210 --> 03:01:27,380
Kan Naoto

3404
03:01:27,680 --> 03:01:28,920
I am...

3405
03:01:30,700 --> 03:01:33,490
I am aware of Mr. Kan...

3406
03:01:35,690 --> 03:01:37,600
Ah right! That's him!

3407
03:01:37,830 --> 03:01:39,870
Kan Chokuto!

3408
03:01:40,280 --> 03:01:41,930
So you heard it from him?

3409
03:01:41,930 --> 03:01:44,230
Yes, Mr. Kan Chokuto

3410
03:01:44,410 --> 03:01:45,910
I can only imagine

3411
03:01:45,910 --> 03:01:50,460
the Prime Minister has come to you to seek some advice

3412
03:01:50,460 --> 03:01:54,110
What were some of his inquiries?

3413
03:01:54,790 --> 03:01:57,670
Well, he talked about his wife...

3414
03:01:57,670 --> 03:02:00,050
Ah, I see...

3415
03:02:00,050 --> 03:02:04,040
He has his own issues like all of us

3416
03:02:04,040 --> 03:02:08,110
As a long time friend of Mr. Kan

3417
03:02:08,110 --> 03:02:12,720
How would you describe him as a person and a husband?

3418
03:02:13,180 --> 03:02:16,800
His marriage is loveless

3419
03:02:18,550 --> 03:02:21,880
You understand what you've just said?

3420
03:02:21,880 --> 03:02:23,250
Yes

3421
03:02:24,440 --> 03:02:28,910
I'm terrified to ask further questions...

3422
03:02:28,910 --> 03:02:32,120
Thank you very much

3423
03:02:28,920 --> 03:02:34,350
Fin

3424
03:02:28,920 --> 03:02:34,350
Protect Japan from World Threats!!

3425
03:02:38,800 --> 03:02:40,680
I barely made it

3426
03:02:41,050 --> 03:02:42,940
That was a lot of talk from him

3427
03:02:44,510 --> 03:02:46,670
Endou, how much "Life" you got left?

3428
03:02:47,520 --> 03:02:48,570
"Life"

3429
03:02:48,570 --> 03:02:50,460
"Life"?

3430
03:02:50,180 --> 03:02:51,550
Man, I'm so embarrassed

3431
03:02:52,250 --> 03:02:57,950
If you started with 10 hearts representing your life force,

3432
03:02:57,950 --> 03:02:59,360
how many hearts you got left?

3433
03:03:02,410 --> 03:03:04,870
I don't get your question...

3434
03:03:07,900 --> 03:03:09,880
Are you serious?

3435
03:03:10,980 --> 03:03:11,820
Serious?

3436
03:03:14,310 --> 03:03:16,100
You guys got that, right?

3437
03:03:16,100 --> 03:03:16,930
Of course

3438
03:03:16,930 --> 03:03:19,230
I gave you an ample explanation

3439
03:03:19,230 --> 03:03:20,690
"Life"?

3440
03:03:23,660 --> 03:03:27,530
L..Life...as in "Living?"

3441
03:03:29,570 --> 03:03:32,260
You know, like in those shooting games,

3442
03:03:32,340 --> 03:03:36,480
you get heart marks representing your vital signs, right?

3443
03:03:36,480 --> 03:03:39,120
And you lose a heart when you get hit

3444
03:03:39,310 --> 03:03:41,670
And once you lose all your hearts, you die, right?

3445
03:03:41,750 --> 03:03:43,870
Game over

3446
03:03:43,870 --> 03:03:49,140
So I was asking how much life you have if you initially had 10

3447
03:03:51,840 --> 03:03:54,550
Listen guys

3448
03:03:54,990 --> 03:04:00,280
This facility keeps notorious criminals locked up here

3449
03:04:00,280 --> 03:04:01,920
Like prisoners?

3450
03:04:02,060 --> 03:04:04,250
Right, pretty dangerous ones

3451
03:04:04,600 --> 03:04:06,820
No, thank you

3452
03:04:07,410 --> 03:04:09,790
Well, it's a learning opportunity

3453
03:04:10,210 --> 03:04:16,460

3454

3455
03:04:11,920 --> 03:04:14,010
Haven't we already seen enough criminals?

3456
03:04:16,990 --> 03:04:19,470
I'd say I have 3 Lives left

3457
03:04:20,290 --> 03:04:22,080
You don't have much left then

3458
03:04:24,010 --> 03:04:25,390
What's "Life" mean anyway?

3459
03:04:25,390 --> 03:04:26,900
Is that a gamer's term?

3460
03:04:27,630 --> 03:04:30,880
I see they keep these guys far away

3461
03:04:33,680 --> 03:04:35,550
Here's the first room

3462
03:04:35,550 --> 03:04:36,050
What?

3463
03:04:36,250 --> 03:04:38,240
You mean there's more than one?

3464
03:04:38,590 --> 03:04:40,110
Here we have

3465
03:04:40,110 --> 03:04:41,980
a criminal hooked on impersonating celebrities

3466
03:04:41,980 --> 03:04:42,740
Let's go in

3467
03:04:43,240 --> 03:04:43,990
Damn...

3468
03:04:45,640 --> 03:04:47,960
I get it now

3469
03:04:50,260 --> 03:04:51,780
Yamasaki first

3470
03:04:51,780 --> 03:04:53,500
Yamasaki, come this way

3471
03:04:53,700 --> 03:04:56,240
Very eerie and terrifying

3472
03:04:57,940 --> 03:04:59,780
Alright then

3473
03:04:59,790 --> 03:05:02,680
To become an elite spy

3474
03:05:02,680 --> 03:05:03,380
What?

3475
03:05:04,140 --> 03:05:07,450
You have to act like a chameleon

3476
03:05:08,130 --> 03:05:10,020
It calls for more practice!

3477
03:05:13,810 --> 03:05:17,970
Croquette

3478
03:05:13,810 --> 03:05:17,970

3479
03:05:19,400 --> 03:05:21,170
Alright then

3480
03:05:21,170 --> 03:05:23,430
To become an elite spy

3481
03:05:23,430 --> 03:05:24,340
What?

3482
03:05:25,110 --> 03:05:28,290
You have to act like a chameleon

3483
03:05:29,240 --> 03:05:31,010
It calls for more practice!

3484
03:05:35,020 --> 03:05:38,620

Hiromi Iwasaki

3488
03:05:42,400 --> 03:05:56,350
The cast laughed but continue watching without interruption

3489
03:05:43,780 --> 03:05:44,830
This was harsh

3490
03:05:51,400 --> 03:05:54,050
We had to watch this right in front of us

3491
03:05:56,930 --> 03:05:58,210
Amazing

3492
03:05:57,160 --> 03:06:22,630
Applause

3493
03:05:57,160 --> 03:06:22,630
Naomi Chiaki

3494
03:06:03,180 --> 03:06:04,510
We had VIP seats

3495
03:06:04,600 --> 03:06:06,080
Yes, front-row seats

3496
03:06:07,680 --> 03:06:09,770
He picked up that fake mole off the toilet

3497
03:06:18,940 --> 03:06:21,570
This isn't fair at all

3498
03:06:21,570 --> 03:06:23,430
Not fair at all!

3499
03:06:23,960 --> 03:06:42,430

03:06:48,410 --> 03:06:49,210
OK, I'm done

3504
03:06:50,220 --> 03:07:18,900
Hiroshi Itsuki

3505
03:06:50,220 --> 03:07:18,900
She Awaits

3506
03:07:11,720 --> 03:07:14,490
He never does that

3507
03:07:18,540 --> 03:07:20,510
Seriously...

3508
03:07:20,600 --> 03:07:56,880
Saburou Kitajima

3509
03:07:20,600 --> 03:07:56,880
Yosaku

3510
03:07:58,980 --> 03:08:01,660
What a cliffhanger!

3511
03:08:03,320 --> 03:08:33,000
Last Advice

3512
03:08:03,320 --> 03:08:33,000
Tetsuya Takeda

3513
03:08:23,200 --> 03:08:24,720
Can he do this normal?

3514
03:08:26,020 --> 03:08:27,820
I guess he can't help it

3515
03:08:27,460 --> 03:08:29,340
He's talented though

3516
03:08:29,760 --> 03:08:31,760
That should do it

3517
03:08:31,760 --> 03:08:33,760
I'm on my way to becoming one of the elites

3518
03:08:33,760 --> 03:08:36,370
But he's back by popular demand!

3519
03:08:36,880 --> 03:09:09,700
Dragonfly

3520
03:08:36,880 --> 03:09:09,700
Tsuyoshi Nagabuchi

3521
03:08:54,620 --> 03:08:56,040
We're gonna hear about this

3522
03:09:14,100 --> 03:09:16,030
He's gonna hear about this one

3523
03:09:19,330 --> 03:09:20,850
I think he fell asleep

3524
03:09:25,470 --> 03:09:27,090
Of course, we are

3525
03:09:39,700 --> 03:09:42,610
Yes, he needs to be locked up

3526
03:09:42,610 --> 03:09:47,760
Well, you're about to see the most dangerous criminal

3527
03:09:47,760 --> 03:09:50,640
Don't let your guard down

3528
03:09:56,990 --> 03:09:59,230
Line up like the last time

3529
03:10:00,430 --> 03:10:01,110
Who's this?

3530
03:10:02,760 --> 03:10:07,490
Most Dangerous Criminal

3531
03:10:02,760 --> 03:10:07,490
Shin Onii

3532
03:10:08,450 --> 03:10:09,290
Come this way

3533
03:10:11,670 --> 03:10:14,140
Line up like the last time

3534
03:10:14,200 --> 03:10:17,160
Who is this?

3535
03:10:17,160 --> 03:10:21,290
Most Dangerous Criminal

3536
03:10:17,160 --> 03:10:21,290
Shin Onii

3537
03:10:21,140 --> 03:10:24,540
He's notorious for faking his identity

3538
03:10:24,540 --> 03:10:29,210
as you just saw the other guy do

3539
03:10:29,210 --> 03:10:31,650
Don't take this guy lightly

3540
03:10:32,240 --> 03:10:33,470
Please proceed

3541
03:10:33,580 --> 03:10:34,640
Yes, sir

3542
03:10:36,290 --> 03:10:40,190
First up, Kesisuke Kuwata

3543
03:10:50,360 --> 03:11:05,990
Impersonation of Keisuke Kuwata

3544
03:10:54,550 --> 03:10:56,870
I want to travel to space

3545
03:10:56,870 --> 03:11:00,370
I don't get him!

3546
03:11:00,370 --> 03:11:02,230
What kind of intro is this?

3547
03:11:02,230 --> 03:11:07,810
And he goes, "The earth is gorgeous!"

3548
03:11:10,430 --> 03:11:11,650
Well, that's fine

3549
03:11:12,690 --> 03:11:14,680
Is he supposed to be Kuwata-san?

3550
03:11:14,680 --> 03:11:16,090
Who is he supposed to be?

3551
03:11:16,500 --> 03:11:17,500
Do you know who he is?

3552
03:11:17,920 --> 03:11:20,010
We have to get out every time?

3553
03:11:21,450 --> 03:11:24,480
How about just one big slap after he's done?

3554
03:11:29,750 --> 03:11:33,090
How does he not know who Keisuke Kuwata is?

3555
03:11:33,830 --> 03:11:37,010
He should know who he is!

3556
03:11:37,110 --> 03:11:39,630
Proceed with Keisuke Kuwata

3557
03:11:38,890 --> 03:12:11,280
Impersonation of Keisuke Kuwata

3558
03:11:41,130 --> 03:11:43,770
Since I was so hungry,

3559
03:11:43,770 --> 03:11:46,530
I hit the Ramen shop

3560
03:11:46,530 --> 03:11:49,070
And I ordered their specialty ramen

3561
03:11:49,390 --> 03:11:51,180
And it was very good

3562
03:11:52,190 --> 03:11:55,860
I asked the cook what his secret is to make such great ramen

3563
03:11:55,860 --> 03:11:59,470
He said it's a secret

3564
03:11:59,470 --> 03:12:02,720
But I really wanted to know

3565
03:12:02,720 --> 03:12:05,120
so I could cook it at home

3566
03:12:05,120 --> 03:12:06,210
It sort of reminds me of

3567
03:12:06,210 --> 03:12:09,120
the flavoring condiments I used to...

3568
03:12:16,850 --> 03:12:18,470
How creepy is he?

3569
03:12:21,850 --> 03:12:26,390
It's just "him" talking, right?

3570
03:12:29,010 --> 03:12:31,570
Go ahead and impersonate Antonio Inoki

3571
03:12:31,570 --> 03:12:44,950
Impersonation of Antonia Inoki

3572
03:12:34,740 --> 03:12:37,020
Gulp

3573
03:12:38,130 --> 03:12:42,740
The beer I had the other day definitely hit the spot

3574
03:12:47,240 --> 03:12:48,730
Isn't he freaky?

3575
03:12:50,800 --> 03:12:52,040
This is rough

3576
03:12:53,840 --> 03:12:55,530
What's up with him?

3577
03:13:01,500 --> 03:13:05,220
This guy's no joke

3578
03:13:05,540 --> 03:13:08,160
Let's see Lupin the Third, please

3579
03:13:08,160 --> 03:13:42,050
Impersonation of Lupin the Third

3580
03:13:09,780 --> 03:13:14,780
Which jewelry store should I hit today and...

3581
03:13:14,780 --> 03:13:17,480
have some fun?

3582
03:13:17,770 --> 03:13:18,860
This is an impersonation?

3583
03:13:18,930 --> 03:13:21,100
As much as I like jewelry

3584
03:13:21,160 --> 03:13:23,770
Hey, lady over there!

3585
03:13:23,770 --> 03:13:26,500
What jewelry do you like?

3586
03:13:29,570 --> 03:13:33,370
Here's some money

3587
03:13:33,370 --> 03:13:37,880
But now you owe me a sexual favor

3588
03:13:38,960 --> 03:13:42,650
Well, how's that for a story?

3589
03:13:44,720 --> 03:13:47,000
Incredible

3590
03:13:47,050 --> 03:13:50,220
What the hell is he talking about?

3591
03:13:59,520 --> 03:14:01,860
That was the best one

3592
03:14:01,860 --> 03:14:06,620
Why not check back on the first man you saw?

3593
03:14:08,300 --> 03:14:10,470
We already watched him

3594
03:14:10,470 --> 03:14:12,460
Yes, we did

3595
03:14:17,440 --> 03:14:18,390
He's ready to do another

3596
03:14:18,390 --> 03:14:21,390
Yeah, he's become someone else

3597
03:14:23,900 --> 03:14:24,420
Who?

3598
03:14:24,420 --> 03:14:25,630
Who?

3599
03:14:25,630 --> 03:14:26,290
Who?

3600
03:14:26,420 --> 03:14:31,730
Goroh Noguchi in fast-forward

3601
03:14:31,760 --> 03:14:53,910
Goroh Noguchi

3602
03:14:31,760 --> 03:14:53,910
Summer Night Dream (Fast forward)

3603
03:15:01,360 --> 03:15:03,230
Don't eat that!

3604
03:15:07,290 --> 03:15:08,130
Amazing

3605
03:15:15,960 --> 03:15:20,550
Exits and Flees

3606
03:15:20,570 --> 03:15:22,310
Get him!

3607
03:15:22,310 --> 03:15:23,930
Apprehend him!

3608
03:15:27,720 --> 03:15:30,410
Well, there he goes

3609
03:15:28,290 --> 03:15:30,890
That was one scary image

3610
03:15:31,300 --> 03:15:32,780
Oh well, he got away

3611
03:15:36,250 --> 03:15:37,540
You can't just let him flee

3612
03:15:37,540 --> 03:15:38,580
He's gone

3613
03:15:39,790 --> 03:15:40,910
OK, then

3614
03:15:41,480 --> 03:15:43,020
Well, we're definitely OUT

3615
03:15:50,600 --> 03:15:52,660
That almost put me over the edge

3616
03:15:53,290 --> 03:15:56,250
He completely owned us

3617
03:15:54,870 --> 03:15:56,270
He's a force to be reckoned with

3618
03:15:57,240 --> 03:16:02,110
For spy trainees, not even dinner is an easy task

3619
03:16:02,620 --> 03:16:06,640
I was amazed how he could just do anything he imagined...

3620
03:16:07,160 --> 03:16:08,860
Listen guys

3621
03:16:09,440 --> 03:16:11,900
It's about dinner time but

3622
03:16:11,900 --> 03:16:15,370
this is still part of training

3623
03:16:15,370 --> 03:16:18,390
So are you familiar with this toy?

3624
03:16:18,160 --> 03:16:19,860
I hate that scary game

3625
03:16:19,680 --> 03:16:21,280
Yeah, I've played with that

3626
03:16:21,290 --> 03:16:22,760
It's taxing on my heart

3627
03:16:22,970 --> 03:16:30,110
Grab a bone from the dog's food bowl without waking him up

3628
03:16:22,970 --> 03:16:30,110
Watch Dog Bow Wow

3629
03:16:30,650 --> 03:16:34,870
Your dinner is on the line!

3630
03:16:34,870 --> 03:16:39,920
Each bone has a dish's name written on it

3631
03:16:39,950 --> 03:16:46,070
Whatever you pick becomes your dinner

3632
03:16:40,190 --> 03:16:45,650
Take turns picking bones for tonight's dinner

3633
03:16:46,410 --> 03:16:51,520
Should he bark at you, your dinner items get confiscated and the game is over

3634
03:16:51,820 --> 03:16:57,700
The rest of you will be served the items written on the bones you grabbed

3635
03:16:52,140 --> 03:16:57,350
The loser will have zero dishes for dinner

3636
03:16:57,700 --> 03:17:00,660
This will train you to be more focused

3637
03:17:00,760 --> 03:17:01,770
Good luck

3638
03:17:02,310 --> 03:17:03,890
The pressure is on

3639
03:17:04,360 --> 03:17:07,110
I'm going to leave him here, so start whenever you're ready

3640
03:17:13,470 --> 03:17:14,740
Furikake (Rice condiment)

3641
03:17:14,740 --> 03:17:15,930
Mezashi...

3642
03:17:16,040 --> 03:17:16,960
Potato salad

3643
03:17:17,170 --> 03:17:18,850
Do we get rice?

3644
03:17:18,850 --> 03:17:20,170
Yes, you'll get a bowl of rice

3645
03:17:21,010 --> 03:17:22,080
I would love the Pork Soup

3646
03:17:22,260 --> 03:17:25,440
Doesn't matter, you gotta pick the ones on top

3647
03:17:28,460 --> 03:17:29,580
Go ahead

3648
03:17:29,580 --> 03:17:35,440
1.Matsumoto

3649
03:17:29,580 --> 03:17:35,440
2.Hamada

3650
03:17:29,580 --> 03:17:35,440
3.Yamasaki

3651
03:17:29,580 --> 03:17:35,440
4.Tanaka

3652
03:17:29,580 --> 03:17:35,440
5.Endou

3653
03:17:29,580 --> 03:17:35,440
Order of Picking

3654
03:17:37,650 --> 03:17:39,450
Matsumoto

3655
03:17:38,670 --> 03:17:39,780
I got Potato Salad

3656
03:17:39,450 --> 03:17:44,670
Matsumoto

3657
03:17:39,500 --> 03:17:44,900
Potato Salad

3658
03:17:39,780 --> 03:17:41,900
That's a good one

3659
03:17:41,900 --> 03:17:43,760
Well, I don't think it's such a good dinner item...

3660
03:17:45,190 --> 03:17:47,220
Yeah, I would want that too

3661
03:17:47,370 --> 03:17:48,240
Hamada

3662
03:17:48,150 --> 03:17:52,440
Mezashi

3663
03:17:48,350 --> 03:17:52,160
Hamada

3664
03:17:50,090 --> 03:17:53,070
Excuse me, but could you...?

3665
03:17:53,140 --> 03:17:55,550
This is too important not to focus

3666
03:17:55,680 --> 03:17:56,830
This makes your dinner

3667
03:18:02,210 --> 03:18:03,650
Yamasaki

3668
03:18:02,990 --> 03:18:05,570
I got Pork Soup

3669
03:18:03,600 --> 03:18:09,820
Pork Soup

3670
03:18:03,650 --> 03:18:09,820
Yamasaki

3671
03:18:05,570 --> 03:18:07,590
You picked a good one!

3672
03:18:06,540 --> 03:18:07,490
That's all I would need

3673
03:18:07,690 --> 03:18:08,390
Tanaka, your turn

3674
03:18:11,690 --> 03:18:13,280
Which one do I go for...?

3675
03:18:13,880 --> 03:18:16,550
Good items are buried in there

3676
03:18:17,600 --> 03:18:19,510
Right, the ones we want are way too deep

3677
03:18:21,280 --> 03:18:22,360
I got Pickled Radish

3678
03:18:21,410 --> 03:18:22,800
Tanaka

3679
03:18:22,800 --> 03:18:26,930
Tanaka

3680
03:18:22,850 --> 03:18:26,930
Pickled Radish

3681
03:18:23,820 --> 03:18:25,120
Well, it's only the first round

3682
03:18:25,670 --> 03:18:26,960
I'll go next then

3683
03:18:30,620 --> 03:18:31,640
Oh, I see something

3684
03:18:31,640 --> 03:18:34,090
I want the Yam Tempura

3685
03:18:36,400 --> 03:18:37,500
Endou

3686
03:18:37,500 --> 03:18:41,720
Endou

3687
03:18:37,550 --> 03:18:41,720
Yam Tempura

3688
03:18:38,260 --> 03:18:39,410
You picked a good one

3689
03:18:39,490 --> 03:18:40,290
Thank you!!

3690
03:18:41,730 --> 03:18:56,400
Matsumoto

3691
03:18:41,730 --> 03:18:56,400
Potato Salad

3692
03:18:42,080 --> 03:18:45,920
This Dried Seaweed looks like an easy pick

3693
03:18:49,750 --> 03:18:51,930
I can't do it!

3694
03:18:51,930 --> 03:18:55,660
What's up with "Fruit bowl"??

3695
03:19:00,310 --> 03:19:02,360
Must the rule apply here, too?

3696
03:19:02,360 --> 03:19:04,120
It appears that way

3697
03:19:07,250 --> 03:19:08,050
That's good

3698
03:19:08,050 --> 03:19:10,260
Keep that up!!

3699
03:19:12,470 --> 03:19:13,490
What's this?

3700
03:19:13,490 --> 03:19:14,940
"Pittan"

3701
03:19:14,940 --> 03:19:17,090
No, that's "Peetan (Century Egg)"

3702
03:19:23,800 --> 03:19:26,370
How do you NOT know that?!

3703
03:19:30,580 --> 03:19:33,540
I'd say you can hit them harder

3704
03:19:35,640 --> 03:19:42,550
Matsumoto

3705
03:19:35,640 --> 03:19:42,550
Potato Salad

3706
03:19:42,350 --> 03:19:45,640
Furikake

3707
03:19:42,440 --> 03:19:43,790
Oh man, I wish I got that!

3708
03:19:42,550 --> 03:19:45,550
Potato Salad

3709
03:19:42,550 --> 03:19:45,640
Matsumoto

3710
03:19:44,640 --> 03:19:46,740
I'd be happy with these two items

3711
03:19:46,790 --> 03:19:48,060
These could be my dinner

3712
03:19:47,960 --> 03:19:49,740
Stops

3713
03:19:52,110 --> 03:19:55,330
He almost woke up!

3714
03:19:53,730 --> 03:19:55,520
He stopped snoring

3715
03:19:56,240 --> 03:19:59,410
Well, there's nothing for me to pick

3716
03:19:59,630 --> 03:20:02,360
I might point out that you're laughing too

3717
03:20:05,840 --> 03:20:07,320
You're having too much fun

3718
03:20:07,350 --> 03:20:08,430
You serious?

3719
03:20:08,510 --> 03:20:10,560
You were like a little boy just now

3720
03:20:10,450 --> 03:20:12,160
You gotta be more serious

3721
03:20:12,000 --> 03:20:13,650
Atta Boy!!

3722
03:20:14,460 --> 03:20:16,060
Keep that, let's keep that form!!

3723
03:20:16,680 --> 03:20:18,360
Bump!

3724
03:20:19,150 --> 03:20:21,230
You could've woken him up with that banging

3725
03:20:23,160 --> 03:20:24,670
How about "Spicy condiments"?

3726
03:20:23,200 --> 03:20:28,450
Hamada

3727
03:20:23,200 --> 03:20:28,450
Mezashi

3728
03:20:24,670 --> 03:20:26,200
That would be good

3729
03:20:30,270 --> 03:20:31,250
That made me jump

3730
03:20:34,640 --> 03:20:36,820
Ah

3731
03:20:36,820 --> 03:20:38,440
I didn't mean to laugh

3732
03:20:41,150 --> 03:20:42,290
It's tough not to laugh

3733
03:20:42,300 --> 03:20:43,660
Very easy to laugh at that

3734
03:20:44,750 --> 03:20:46,310
Especially when it happens to someone else

3735
03:20:47,320 --> 03:20:50,220
What do you say, Fujiwara-san?

3736
03:20:50,250 --> 03:20:53,940
You'll be left hungry with what you have so far

3737
03:20:53,940 --> 03:20:56,580
I'm granting you one more chance

3738
03:20:55,750 --> 03:20:57,020
Thank you

3739
03:20:57,040 --> 03:21:00,350
But I'm confiscating Hamada-san's item

3740
03:20:58,420 --> 03:21:00,880
Of course, and we get to keep ours, right?

3741
03:21:00,350 --> 03:21:09,340
Hamada's "Mezashi" gets confiscated

3742
03:21:06,590 --> 03:21:08,290
It's Yamasaki-san's turn

3743
03:21:09,770 --> 03:21:11,430
He just stirred this up a little...

3744
03:21:11,510 --> 03:21:14,520
Right, the bones got rearranged

3745
03:21:16,040 --> 03:21:27,700
Pork Soup

3746
03:21:16,040 --> 03:21:27,700
Yamasaki

3747
03:21:17,010 --> 03:21:19,470
I can't see what it is, but I'm going for it

3748
03:21:22,500 --> 03:21:23,250
I got it

3749
03:21:23,250 --> 03:21:26,110
You set the next person up good

3750
03:21:26,110 --> 03:21:27,960
I got the "Steal"

3751
03:21:27,700 --> 03:21:47,800
Steal

3752
03:21:27,700 --> 03:21:49,740
Pork Soup

3753
03:21:27,700 --> 03:21:49,770
Yamasaki

3754
03:21:28,640 --> 03:21:30,480
You can take anybody's item

3755
03:21:31,790 --> 03:21:34,620
Please, don't hide yours

3756
03:21:34,720 --> 03:21:35,970
Endou, what do you got?

3757
03:21:35,970 --> 03:21:38,150
I don't have anything super

3758
03:21:38,150 --> 03:21:39,700
He has "Yam Tempura"!!

3759
03:21:39,680 --> 03:21:41,040
Yam Tempura?

3760
03:21:41,040 --> 03:21:42,290
I don't think this is that great

3761
03:21:42,050 --> 03:21:43,370
I got these two...

3762
03:21:42,330 --> 03:21:44,040
You got "Potato Salad" and "Furikake"

3763
03:21:44,330 --> 03:21:45,230
Well then,

3764
03:21:45,230 --> 03:21:46,560
I'm taking your Tempura

3765
03:21:46,210 --> 03:21:47,850
Yam Tempura

3766
03:21:46,210 --> 03:21:48,300
Endou

3767
03:21:46,560 --> 03:21:47,930
You serious?!

3768
03:21:47,850 --> 03:21:49,820
Yam Tempura

3769
03:21:47,930 --> 03:21:48,900
You got a good one

3770
03:21:48,300 --> 03:21:49,820
Endou

3771
03:21:48,900 --> 03:21:50,030
Hosei-san, you gotta be kidding!!

3772
03:21:50,460 --> 03:21:54,300
Pickled Radish

3773
03:21:50,460 --> 03:21:54,300
Pudding

3774
03:21:50,460 --> 03:21:54,300
Tanaka

3775
03:21:50,930 --> 03:21:52,010
I got the Pudding!

3776
03:21:54,330 --> 03:21:58,040
Endou

3777
03:21:54,330 --> 03:21:58,040
Hijiki

3778
03:21:54,370 --> 03:21:58,440
Despite the "Steal" hoopla, the cast successfully replenish their dinner items

3779
03:21:58,660 --> 03:22:04,900
Furikake

3780
03:21:58,660 --> 03:22:04,900
Matsumoto

3781
03:21:58,660 --> 03:22:04,900
Potato Salad

3782
03:22:00,120 --> 03:22:04,900
Black Beans

3783
03:22:00,210 --> 03:22:01,170
I'm not into this one

3784
03:22:01,170 --> 03:22:02,300
Not one bit!

3785
03:22:04,060 --> 03:22:06,540
Hamada-san, you're still at zero dinner items...

3786
03:22:07,290 --> 03:22:09,590
I'm going for the "Dried Seaweed" then

3787
03:22:10,680 --> 03:22:13,780
You'd better grab what you said you will!!

3788
03:22:14,440 --> 03:22:15,220
Don't worry

3789
03:22:19,440 --> 03:22:20,350
Hamada

3790
03:22:20,350 --> 03:22:27,890
Dried Seaweed

3791
03:22:20,350 --> 03:22:27,890
Hamada

3792
03:22:22,770 --> 03:22:26,430
I saw zero focus in the way you picked that

3793
03:22:28,540 --> 03:22:29,880
What?

3794
03:22:32,110 --> 03:22:33,380
Were you laughing?

3795
03:22:33,410 --> 03:22:35,970
He sure is enjoying this game

3796
03:22:39,700 --> 03:22:41,640
Nice Hit!

3797
03:22:42,330 --> 03:22:44,560
But you can still hit harder!!

3798
03:22:45,180 --> 03:22:47,340
I know you can!!

3799
03:22:47,550 --> 03:22:48,680
It's gotten really brutal...

3800
03:22:48,730 --> 03:22:52,190
You can hit harder, I know you can!!

3801
03:22:50,680 --> 03:22:52,200
SHUT THE HELL UP!!

3802
03:22:58,810 --> 03:23:01,010
Too much horsing around

3803
03:23:02,170 --> 03:23:03,730
Let's see what you can do

3804
03:23:09,140 --> 03:23:10,070
Good one!

3805
03:23:10,280 --> 03:23:12,920
Miso Glazed Item

3806
03:23:10,280 --> 03:23:12,920
Pork Soup

3807
03:23:10,280 --> 03:23:12,920
Yam Tempura

3808
03:23:10,280 --> 03:23:12,920
Yamasaki

3809
03:23:10,320 --> 03:23:15,780
Yamasaki, Tanaka, and Endou's dinner items

3810
03:23:13,060 --> 03:23:16,200
Pickled Radish

3811
03:23:13,060 --> 03:23:16,200
Pickled Shallots

3812
03:23:13,060 --> 03:23:16,200
Pudding

3813
03:23:13,060 --> 03:23:16,200
Tanaka

3814
03:23:15,780 --> 03:23:18,610
You've got way too many pickled things!!

3815
03:23:16,210 --> 03:23:23,040
Endou

3816
03:23:16,210 --> 03:23:23,040
Fruit Bowl

3817
03:23:16,210 --> 03:23:23,040
Hijiki

3818
03:23:18,610 --> 03:23:19,960
I got the "Fruit Bowl"

3819
03:23:23,450 --> 03:23:26,280
I see "Fried Prawns"

3820
03:23:29,090 --> 03:23:32,060
But the "Kouya Tofu" is covering the "Fried Prawns"

3821
03:23:31,810 --> 03:23:35,810
Man, I haven't had tofu in awhile

3822
03:23:34,530 --> 03:23:39,400
Who gives a crap whether you've had tofu recently

3823
03:23:45,420 --> 03:23:46,400
Of course, we are

3824
03:23:47,100 --> 03:23:48,860
I'd say it was more Matsumoto-san...

3825
03:23:52,080 --> 03:23:53,030
That's scary hard

3826
03:23:53,650 --> 03:23:54,630
They're hitting hard

3827
03:23:55,490 --> 03:23:57,220
The hitting has gotten harsh at this hour

3828
03:24:00,300 --> 03:24:15,580
Black Beans

3829
03:24:00,300 --> 03:24:15,580
Furikake

3830
03:24:00,300 --> 03:24:15,580
Matsumoto

3831
03:24:00,300 --> 03:24:15,580
Potato Salad

3832
03:24:05,480 --> 03:24:08,390
Don't put any weight on that, or else...

3833
03:24:09,350 --> 03:24:11,890
I'd say you have enough items for dinner now

3834
03:24:09,520 --> 03:24:15,580
Kouya Tofu

3835
03:24:11,890 --> 03:24:15,800
I'm good at this

3836
03:24:17,120 --> 03:24:19,480
Wouldn't you say he's laughing now?

3837
03:24:19,940 --> 03:24:21,260
Got it!

3838
03:24:21,260 --> 03:24:23,310
"Peetan!!"

3839
03:24:26,330 --> 03:24:28,390
How many times did we have to point that out, huh?

3840
03:24:29,330 --> 03:24:30,810
Do you ever learn?

3841
03:24:30,810 --> 03:24:33,220
Why do you gotta laugh every time you pick one?

3842
03:24:36,520 --> 03:24:38,460
Good one!

3843
03:24:39,600 --> 03:24:42,450
But you can still hit harder!!!!

3844
03:24:45,770 --> 03:24:48,160
I bet we're seeing some good ones now

3845
03:24:47,870 --> 03:25:01,080
Miso Glazed Dish

3846
03:24:47,870 --> 03:25:01,080
Pork Soup

3847
03:24:47,870 --> 03:25:01,080
Yam Tempura

3848
03:24:47,870 --> 03:25:01,080
Yamasaki

3849
03:24:53,250 --> 03:24:53,720
What's that?

3850
03:24:53,720 --> 03:24:55,510
Kinpira Gobou (Burdock roots)

3851
03:24:55,100 --> 03:25:01,080
Kinpira Gobou

3852
03:24:55,510 --> 03:25:01,120
Mine's turning into a gourmet meal!!

3853
03:25:01,120 --> 03:25:09,870
Pickled Radish

3854
03:25:01,120 --> 03:25:09,870
Pickled Shallots

3855
03:25:01,120 --> 03:25:09,870
Pudding

3856
03:25:01,120 --> 03:25:09,870
Tanaka

3857
03:25:03,340 --> 03:25:05,110
I got Dried Sardines!

3858
03:25:04,470 --> 03:25:09,870
Dried Sardines

3859
03:25:06,980 --> 03:25:08,100
All of your items are cheap

3860
03:25:08,150 --> 03:25:10,340
I can see "Hamburger" now

3861
03:25:10,610 --> 03:25:12,750
It's still way too buried though

3862
03:25:13,090 --> 03:25:15,510
The dog will get you if you put any weight on it

3863
03:25:16,480 --> 03:25:17,520
This will be big if I can get it

3864
03:25:17,950 --> 03:25:43,820
Endou

3865
03:25:17,950 --> 03:25:43,820
Fruit Bowl

3866
03:25:17,950 --> 03:25:43,820
Hijiki

3867
03:25:18,530 --> 03:25:21,020
I wish I had longer nails for this

3868
03:25:22,280 --> 03:25:24,150
So, you're gonna make that move?

3869
03:25:24,150 --> 03:25:27,240
Damn it, how come I don't have a split finger tip?

3870
03:25:27,010 --> 03:25:28,910
Wow, that's a bold move

3871
03:25:29,840 --> 03:25:32,320
If my finger tip was split like this...

3872
03:25:32,150 --> 03:25:35,340
Could you please be quiet?

3873
03:25:39,070 --> 03:25:40,590
Serious?

3874
03:25:40,540 --> 03:25:43,820
Sliced Cheese

3875
03:25:40,610 --> 03:25:41,950
This was the only one I could get

3876
03:25:40,950 --> 03:25:43,420
I don't see how you got that

3877
03:25:43,250 --> 03:25:44,140
I got "Cheese"

3878
03:25:44,290 --> 03:25:49,300
Your finger tip must be split or something...

3879
03:25:50,240 --> 03:25:54,700
I'd say this other tofu is the easiest to pick but

3880
03:25:50,350 --> 03:26:00,640
Black Beans

3881
03:25:50,350 --> 03:26:00,640
Furikake

3882
03:25:50,350 --> 03:26:00,640
Kouya Tofu

3883
03:25:50,350 --> 03:26:00,640
Matsumoto

3884
03:25:50,350 --> 03:26:00,640
Potato Salad

3885
03:25:55,390 --> 03:26:00,630
I'm afraid I'll end up with all "Old-Fart" dishes

3886
03:26:21,620 --> 03:26:22,700
Nice hit!

3887
03:26:22,750 --> 03:26:27,280
You just hit the back of my thigh

3888
03:26:29,890 --> 03:26:36,470
Black Beans

3889
03:26:29,890 --> 03:26:36,470
Furikake

3890
03:26:29,890 --> 03:26:36,470
Kouya Tofu

3891
03:26:29,890 --> 03:26:36,470
Matsumoto

3892
03:26:29,890 --> 03:26:36,470
Potato Salad

3893
03:26:31,640 --> 03:26:32,350
He's got it

3894
03:26:32,760 --> 03:26:36,470
Miso Soup

3895
03:26:34,720 --> 03:26:36,390
Gotta be kidding me!

3896
03:26:37,250 --> 03:26:38,720
Seriously...

3897
03:26:38,720 --> 03:26:41,860
I'm going for that "tofu" piece then...

3898
03:26:48,350 --> 03:26:49,800
How sucky are you at this game?

3899
03:26:53,690 --> 03:26:55,250
No doubt

3900
03:26:55,270 --> 03:26:57,790
I more or less jumped...

3901
03:26:58,850 --> 03:27:00,140
Well, that was...

3902
03:27:00,140 --> 03:27:02,440
I know you can do better

3903
03:27:02,440 --> 03:27:04,840
"Skill Up" yourself!!

3904
03:27:04,840 --> 03:27:07,320
Unfortunately, Hamada, I'm confiscating yours

3905
03:27:07,990 --> 03:27:13,150
Dinner Consists of Their Picked Items

3906
03:27:08,320 --> 03:27:15,170
Upon training, each casts prepare their late dinner

3907
03:27:15,830 --> 03:27:18,570
Mine looks pretty healthy after all

3908
03:27:18,570 --> 03:27:22,590
Hamada-san, this is yours

3909
03:27:22,800 --> 03:27:24,580
What the hell is this?

3910
03:27:25,470 --> 03:27:26,830
Itadakimasu

3911
03:27:27,660 --> 03:27:30,810
Black Beans

3912
03:27:27,660 --> 03:27:30,810
Furikake

3913
03:27:27,660 --> 03:27:30,810
Kouya Tofu

3914
03:27:27,660 --> 03:27:30,810
Matsumoto

3915
03:27:27,660 --> 03:27:30,810
Miso Soup

3916
03:27:27,660 --> 03:27:30,810
Potato Salad

3917
03:27:29,820 --> 03:27:30,630
Delicious!

3918
03:27:30,950 --> 03:27:32,890
Kinpira Gobou

3919
03:27:30,950 --> 03:27:32,890
Miso Glazed Dish

3920
03:27:30,950 --> 03:27:32,890
Pork Soup

3921
03:27:30,950 --> 03:27:32,890
Yam Tempura

3922
03:27:30,950 --> 03:27:32,890
Yamasaki

3923
03:27:33,220 --> 03:27:36,010
Endou

3924
03:27:33,220 --> 03:27:36,010
Fruit Bowl

3925
03:27:33,220 --> 03:27:36,010
Hijiki

3926
03:27:33,220 --> 03:27:36,010
Sliced Cheese

3927
03:27:33,480 --> 03:27:35,590
Miso Soup would be perfect...

3928
03:27:35,650 --> 03:27:36,660
I agree

3929
03:27:38,000 --> 03:27:39,680
Pork Soup would be good, too

3930
03:27:38,720 --> 03:27:42,200
Dried Sardine

3931
03:27:38,720 --> 03:27:42,200
Pickled Radish

3932
03:27:38,720 --> 03:27:42,200
Pickled Shallots

3933
03:27:38,720 --> 03:27:42,200
Pudding

3934
03:27:38,720 --> 03:27:42,200
Tanaka

3935
03:27:42,640 --> 03:27:45,540
I wouldn't mind giving you a piece of black bean

3936
03:27:49,450 --> 03:27:51,860
You laughed, huh?

3937
03:27:54,950 --> 03:27:56,400
Why didn't you just give it to me?

3938
03:27:59,560 --> 03:28:00,280
That's a good one!

3939
03:28:00,280 --> 03:28:02,570
You're on the roll!

3940
03:28:02,570 --> 03:28:04,830
Not a bad roll!!

3941
03:28:13,980 --> 03:28:16,580
Time is 9:30pm

3942
03:28:16,580 --> 03:28:20,070
After dinner, the cast has a tea break

3943
03:28:21,130 --> 03:28:22,600
My butt hurts

3944
03:28:22,970 --> 03:28:26,310
Endou, how about something to drink?

3945
03:28:26,310 --> 03:28:28,870
Why don't you have some Suga Tea?

3946
03:28:30,030 --> 03:28:33,130
Why did you have to ask like that?

3947
03:28:36,540 --> 03:28:40,370
You laughed just now

3948
03:28:37,980 --> 03:28:40,820
Yeah, you were laughing just now

3949
03:28:40,340 --> 03:28:41,790
You think so?

3950
03:28:42,560 --> 03:28:44,960
I thought I was more or less put off by his question

3951
03:28:45,240 --> 03:28:48,340
I thought I did a good job responding to his question

3952
03:28:49,720 --> 03:28:54,160
GIA Special Elite Team is in the facility

3953
03:28:54,360 --> 03:28:56,770
I'm sure we can learn a thing or two from them

3954
03:28:57,200 --> 03:29:05,130
Learn from the GIA Special Elite Team

3955
03:28:57,200 --> 03:29:05,130
Spy Training

3956
03:29:06,450 --> 03:29:08,700
Elite....

3957
03:29:13,230 --> 03:29:13,700
This way

3958
03:29:14,160 --> 03:29:14,740
Here they are

3959
03:29:16,760 --> 03:29:17,410
Greetings

3960
03:29:17,470 --> 03:29:18,530
Damn...

3961
03:29:19,060 --> 03:29:28,370
GIA Special Team

3962
03:29:28,370 --> 03:29:30,960
Make sure you learn from these guys

3963
03:29:30,960 --> 03:29:35,020
They are the elite?

3964
03:29:31,550 --> 03:29:33,690
This was a rough spot to be in

3965
03:29:35,330 --> 03:29:41,240
MSB consists of members who survived the world's chaos and strife

3966
03:29:41,500 --> 03:29:43,420
Kendou Kobayashi

3967
03:29:41,500 --> 03:29:43,420
Leader

3968
03:29:46,270 --> 03:29:52,220
Our talent is having an unlimited amount of will to live

3969
03:29:52,150 --> 03:29:57,790
No method of torture can get us to talk

3970
03:29:58,030 --> 03:30:01,620
OK, get ready then

3971
03:30:04,220 --> 03:30:07,610
I heard him say "torture"

3972
03:30:05,860 --> 03:30:08,090
Yes, he said "torture"

3973
03:30:08,090 --> 03:30:08,700
Check them out

3974
03:30:08,700 --> 03:30:10,630
There's no youth left in those bodies

3975
03:30:14,950 --> 03:30:17,410
Now don't be alarmed

3976
03:30:17,410 --> 03:30:21,020
Once you face numerous life and death situations,

3977
03:30:21,840 --> 03:30:24,480
like all of us here,

3978
03:30:24,480 --> 03:30:28,290
you're bound to morph into a perfect physical specimen

3979
03:30:44,430 --> 03:30:46,940
Please don't hit the back of my thigh

3980
03:30:49,410 --> 03:30:50,750
By the way, people

3981
03:30:50,750 --> 03:30:55,690
You're here to witness the results of our training

3982
03:30:55,960 --> 03:30:57,670
Bring it in!!

3983
03:31:01,040 --> 03:31:04,680
This is just a warm up exercise

3984
03:31:04,700 --> 03:31:05,760
But this device

3985
03:31:05,760 --> 03:31:08,260
belonged to the Soviet Union in the 60's

3986
03:31:08,260 --> 03:31:10,670
Vacuum Cyclone Launcher!!

3987
03:31:08,670 --> 03:31:14,760
Torture Device which Sucks in Your Nose and Mouth

3988
03:31:08,670 --> 03:31:14,760
Vacuum Cyclone Launcher

3989
03:31:15,360 --> 03:31:17,040
Iwao!!

3990
03:31:17,040 --> 03:31:18,200
Are you up for this?

3991
03:31:17,310 --> 03:31:20,380
Football Hour

3992
03:31:17,310 --> 03:31:20,380
Nozomu Iwao

3993
03:31:23,340 --> 03:31:24,500
Are you ready?

3994
03:31:54,720 --> 03:31:57,540
Don't be looking at me

3995
03:31:56,700 --> 03:31:58,100
How was it?

3996
03:31:57,540 --> 03:31:59,780
No need to be looking at me

3997
03:31:58,180 --> 03:31:59,560
No problem, sir

3998
03:32:02,050 --> 03:32:03,030
Kinoshita!

3999
03:32:03,730 --> 03:32:06,640
Takayuki Kinoshita

4000
03:32:04,600 --> 03:32:06,400
This should be a cake walk for you

4001
03:32:09,590 --> 03:32:10,140
Ready?

4002
03:32:41,680 --> 03:32:42,840
Not bad

4003
03:32:42,870 --> 03:32:44,270
Good hits

4004
03:32:45,460 --> 03:32:46,740
You OK?

4005
03:32:46,740 --> 03:32:47,850
I'm OK

4006
03:32:47,780 --> 03:32:50,500
Looks like he's short on oxygen

4007
03:32:50,030 --> 03:32:51,650
Let's bring out the next one

4008
03:32:57,090 --> 03:32:58,360
Ahh...

4009
03:32:57,360 --> 03:33:00,060
That's an elaborate machine...

4010
03:33:00,310 --> 03:33:04,760
This was used up until recently in Afghanistan

4011
03:33:04,930 --> 03:33:07,800
Patriot Interceptor: Pitching Harisen!!

4012
03:33:08,660 --> 03:33:11,820
Consider yourselves lucky

4013
03:33:11,820 --> 03:33:16,530
because the legendary Mr. Ueshima will demonstrate it for you all

4014
03:33:15,560 --> 03:33:18,850
Ostrich Club

4015
03:33:15,560 --> 03:33:18,850
Ryuhei Ueshima

4016
03:33:18,670 --> 03:33:21,600
Will you demonstrate for us?

4017
03:33:21,430 --> 03:33:33,970
Large Paper Fan Smashes Subject's Head

4018
03:33:21,430 --> 03:33:33,970
Patriot Interceptor: Pitching Harisen

4019
03:33:22,200 --> 03:33:24,540
You know nothing's gonna get me to "talk"

4020
03:33:24,540 --> 03:33:25,780
Thank you, sir

4021
03:33:30,760 --> 03:33:32,010
Will you scoot over?

4022
03:33:32,170 --> 03:33:33,060
Scoot back a little, please?

4023
03:33:35,070 --> 03:33:37,910
Move back a little?

4024
03:33:38,810 --> 03:33:40,560
Scoot forward a little

4025
03:33:40,680 --> 03:33:42,520
Bingo!

4026
03:33:42,520 --> 03:33:44,210
Wait, scoot forward a little

4027
03:33:44,210 --> 03:33:46,620
Get it right, already!!

4028
03:33:49,330 --> 03:33:52,580
I don't feel justified being slapped by that

4029
03:33:58,260 --> 03:34:00,490
Remember the rules

4030
03:34:03,060 --> 03:34:04,220
Are we ready?

4031
03:34:04,620 --> 03:34:06,870
Fire!!

4032
03:34:15,290 --> 03:34:16,900
That's a shot!!

4033
03:34:21,620 --> 03:34:22,800
Not good

4034
03:34:22,800 --> 03:34:23,510
That wasn't good

4035
03:34:23,990 --> 03:34:26,790
I believe there's a mistake

4036
03:34:29,390 --> 03:34:30,550
Are you OK?

4037
03:34:30,550 --> 03:34:32,430
He screamed "OUCH!!"

4038
03:34:33,790 --> 03:34:35,000
You can do this too

4039
03:34:35,000 --> 03:34:37,750
I heard you scream ITAI (ouch)

4040
03:34:38,130 --> 03:34:40,560
No, he said AITAI (want to get together)

4041
03:34:40,740 --> 03:34:42,940
Who do you want to get together?

4042
03:34:43,620 --> 03:34:46,820
How dare you ask me a question?

4043
03:34:54,180 --> 03:34:56,150
Right, we need to know our roles...

4044
03:34:58,900 --> 03:34:59,800
Amazing hit

4045
03:34:59,640 --> 03:35:00,540
Yeah, it was

4046
03:35:00,150 --> 03:35:03,400
Newcomers like us shouldn't be allowed to talk...

4047
03:35:03,420 --> 03:35:05,090
Then will you ask him on our behalf?

4048
03:35:05,090 --> 03:35:06,150
Wait a sec

4049
03:35:06,150 --> 03:35:07,660
I seem to be bleeding

4050
03:35:25,660 --> 03:35:27,870
Bring in the next machine!!

4051
03:35:34,150 --> 03:35:36,660
This is a "Red Partisan Snake"

4052
03:35:36,660 --> 03:35:38,750
from Papua New Guinea

4053
03:35:38,750 --> 03:35:44,030
Its potent venom can kill a cow within 10 minutes

4054
03:35:42,250 --> 03:35:50,190
Grab the snake and put it in a wooden box

4055
03:35:42,250 --> 03:35:50,190
Red Partisan Snake

4056
03:35:44,620 --> 03:35:50,140
Let's see who can take on this task

4057
03:35:50,760 --> 03:35:52,680
Yoshinobu!!

4058
03:35:52,930 --> 03:35:55,480
Producer

4059
03:35:52,930 --> 03:35:55,480
Yoshinobu Nakamura

4060
03:35:53,650 --> 03:35:54,200
Try it

4061
03:35:54,660 --> 03:35:58,810
Show us how you can catch it with your bare hands

4062
03:35:58,810 --> 03:36:02,120
and place it in the wooden box

4063
03:36:04,840 --> 03:36:05,340
Well then...

4064
03:36:07,860 --> 03:36:09,310
Put him in that box

4065
03:36:09,630 --> 03:36:11,690
Store him

4066
03:36:13,730 --> 03:36:14,540
Looking good

4067
03:36:20,550 --> 03:36:23,820
The snake feels threatened

4068
03:36:23,820 --> 03:36:26,860
I'd say the snake is trembling in fear!

4069
03:36:41,580 --> 03:36:44,180
I heard him go, "AHHHH!!!"

4070
03:36:44,180 --> 03:36:46,190
Great job!

4071
03:36:46,190 --> 03:36:50,360
*The snake is not poisonous

4072
03:36:52,760 --> 03:36:55,700
That was clearly a cry for help

4073
03:36:55,970 --> 03:36:57,540
Shall we move on?

4074
03:36:57,710 --> 03:36:59,260
Bring in the next machine!

4075
03:37:01,920 --> 03:37:10,870
Catch the Endless Drops of Milk in Your Mouth

4076
03:37:01,920 --> 03:37:10,870
Endless Milk Tomahawk

4077
03:37:09,110 --> 03:37:09,810
Takeyama!!

4078
03:37:11,020 --> 03:37:14,540
Cunning Takeyama

4079
03:37:16,270 --> 03:37:17,010
Ready?

4080
03:37:22,430 --> 03:37:24,780
Drink all of it

4081
03:37:28,400 --> 03:37:29,920
Good job

4082
03:37:35,070 --> 03:37:36,550
He's spilling it

4083
03:37:43,040 --> 03:37:45,540
He just spilled it all over the place

4084
03:37:53,600 --> 03:37:55,410
I wouldn't call that a success

4085
03:37:55,410 --> 03:37:58,080
Just to keep you guys in awe

4086
03:37:58,080 --> 03:38:00,290
Bring out the next machine!

4087
03:38:05,280 --> 03:38:06,900
Settle down, people

4088
03:38:07,360 --> 03:38:09,220
As you might already recognize, it is...

4089
03:38:08,030 --> 03:38:17,930
Place the special cotton on the subject's butt and light it

4090
03:38:08,030 --> 03:38:17,930
Scud Cotton Missile

4091
03:38:09,220 --> 03:38:11,590
Scud Cotton Missile!!

4092
03:38:18,710 --> 03:38:20,650
Haranishi!

4093
03:38:20,650 --> 03:38:25,300
Takayuki Haranishi

4094
03:38:29,000 --> 03:38:31,160
What an ass!

4095
03:38:34,990 --> 03:38:35,760
Are you good?

4096
03:38:37,700 --> 03:38:39,550
You got this

4097
03:38:40,260 --> 03:38:43,460
His ass feels nice

4098
03:38:43,140 --> 03:38:46,170
What the hell's wrong with him?

4099
03:38:49,340 --> 03:38:51,160
What an ass

4100
03:38:54,510 --> 03:38:55,580
Are you good?

4101
03:38:58,380 --> 03:38:59,620
You got this

4102
03:39:00,710 --> 03:39:03,700
His ass feels nice

4103
03:39:03,700 --> 03:39:06,650
What the hell's wrong with him?

4104
03:39:21,120 --> 03:39:22,950
He didn't light the wick

4105
03:39:24,670 --> 03:39:25,650
Stinks!

4106
03:39:25,650 --> 03:39:26,790
That stinks

4107
03:39:28,560 --> 03:39:29,920
Good job

4108
03:39:31,680 --> 03:39:34,360
What's with you?

4109
03:39:34,360 --> 03:39:36,340
What're you talking about?

4110
03:39:43,480 --> 03:39:44,900
What hit you?

4111
03:39:45,290 --> 03:39:48,040
It's clear that you're hiding something

4112
03:39:47,730 --> 03:39:52,990
The leader burnt off half of his eye brows

4113
03:39:48,340 --> 03:39:49,610
Nonsense!!

4114
03:39:51,690 --> 03:39:53,060
What happened to you, leader?

4115
03:39:53,690 --> 03:39:57,770
My appearance hasn't changed at all

4116
03:39:57,810 --> 03:40:01,250
I'd say you've proved enough

4117
03:40:04,780 --> 03:40:07,160
Panty Hose Balloon Bomb

4118
03:40:08,230 --> 03:40:11,660
Sorry I'm late

4119
03:40:12,010 --> 03:40:13,920
Hope I'm not too late

4120
03:40:14,170 --> 03:40:18,610
Rigorous training has affected his hormone balance

4121
03:40:18,610 --> 03:40:20,750
And now he's asexual

4122
03:40:20,330 --> 03:40:23,150
Chris Matsumura

4123
03:40:23,190 --> 03:40:26,060
Are you ready to go?

4124
03:40:31,650 --> 03:40:36,960
Special Attire Made of Hand Towels

4125
03:40:38,850 --> 03:40:39,720
Sighs

4126
03:40:41,110 --> 03:40:42,580
Put this on

4127
03:40:43,240 --> 03:40:54,550
Panty Hose Balloon Bomb

4128
03:40:43,240 --> 03:40:54,550
Pop the balloon inside the panty hose

4129
03:40:54,680 --> 03:40:58,320
I'm sensing a catastrophe

4130
03:40:58,640 --> 03:41:01,570
Panty hose balloon bomb

4131
03:41:02,200 --> 03:41:05,400
Engage

4132
03:41:09,940 --> 03:41:13,800
Why is he ignoring us?

4133
03:41:13,800 --> 03:41:16,160
Oh, he just looked at us

4134
03:41:14,180 --> 03:41:16,160
I think he's winking at us

4135
03:41:16,180 --> 03:41:18,620
His cheek bones are something else

4136
03:41:25,300 --> 03:41:25,990
Is he OK?

4137
03:41:25,990 --> 03:41:27,070
Is he OK?

4138
03:41:29,110 --> 03:41:31,060
Is he alright?

4139
03:41:33,440 --> 03:41:35,380
Kind of resembles Large Head Hairtail

4140
03:41:39,760 --> 03:41:42,510
He didn't hold back

4141
03:41:42,970 --> 03:41:46,320
He went "Ahhhh"

4142
03:41:46,320 --> 03:41:47,820
He was definitely scared

4143
03:41:50,130 --> 03:41:53,480
That was one loud scream

4144
03:41:53,000 --> 03:41:54,770
It somehow made his face long

4145
03:41:58,730 --> 03:41:59,510
Alright!

4146
03:41:59,510 --> 03:42:01,350
Who's next!

4147
03:42:01,350 --> 03:42:03,840
"Swimsuit Giant Swing"

4148
03:42:03,840 --> 03:42:11,110
Subject Gets Swung around Wearing a Female Swimsuit

4149
03:42:03,840 --> 03:42:11,110
Swimsuit Giant Swing

4150
03:42:11,020 --> 03:42:11,830
What the hell?

4151
03:42:11,830 --> 03:42:14,010
Mr. Ueshima!!

4152
03:42:14,010 --> 03:42:15,330
Could you?

4153
03:42:16,140 --> 03:42:16,740
I got this

4154
03:42:22,540 --> 03:42:24,400
Mr. Ueshima

4155
03:42:30,890 --> 03:42:32,590
Show us how it's done!

4156
03:42:47,650 --> 03:42:48,900
He tossed him hard

4157
03:42:54,320 --> 03:42:55,900
That sounded awkward

4158
03:42:55,550 --> 03:42:56,550
Are you alright?

4159
03:43:00,610 --> 03:43:06,010
It's nothing short of a miracle that your body is still in one piece

4160
03:43:06,010 --> 03:43:08,040
Let us see it again!

4161
03:43:08,040 --> 03:43:09,330
This is no joke

4162
03:43:09,340 --> 03:43:12,490
Well, I take that back

4163
03:43:12,580 --> 03:43:15,270
He clearly said it's no joke

4164
03:43:13,940 --> 03:43:15,140
No way, this is nothing

4165
03:43:15,720 --> 03:43:16,890
Look at him laughing

4166
03:43:19,120 --> 03:43:20,620
Watch it!

4167
03:43:20,630 --> 03:43:22,080
Watch it, watch it!!

4168
03:43:50,870 --> 03:43:51,860
Awesome, guys

4169
03:43:51,860 --> 03:43:53,380
That was great

4170
03:43:53,380 --> 03:43:55,860
He ain't one of the elites for nothing

4171
03:43:55,830 --> 03:43:58,600
Next up is this!!

4172
03:44:00,610 --> 03:44:02,360
That's a huge prop

4173
03:44:02,640 --> 03:44:04,160
This isn't anything new to you

4174
03:44:04,160 --> 03:44:06,560
"A Human Watermill"

4175
03:44:06,560 --> 03:44:08,980
No man can endure this for more than three minutes

4176
03:44:09,190 --> 03:44:11,740
This torture device has been around for 3,000 years

4177
03:44:11,790 --> 03:44:15,230
And only one man has refused to "talk" during this torture

4178
03:44:15,230 --> 03:44:18,250
It's Mr. Ueshima!!

4179
03:44:18,370 --> 03:44:19,250
What's this?

4180
03:44:19,250 --> 03:44:21,490
If you would, please!

4181
03:44:23,040 --> 03:44:27,690
Look at him giving the dirtiest look

4182
03:44:30,680 --> 03:44:33,070
I can't reach...

4183
03:44:36,340 --> 03:44:37,170
You can't grab onto that?

4184
03:44:37,970 --> 03:44:42,750
Shouldn't he have a better grip than that?

4185
03:44:58,610 --> 03:45:02,870
I told you he's too short to be on that wheel!

4186
03:45:08,570 --> 03:45:09,560
He's way too short for that

4187
03:45:11,640 --> 03:45:15,200
A man of this caliber can take two revolutions, right?

4188
03:45:16,140 --> 03:45:18,830
And that's exactly what he's doing right now!

4189
03:45:19,420 --> 03:45:20,110
Mr. Ueshima!

4190
03:45:20,110 --> 03:45:22,070
Here's two revolutions

4191
03:45:28,510 --> 03:45:31,120
What the hell are you doing?

4192
03:45:49,860 --> 03:45:54,280
He ain't an elite spy for nothing

4193
03:45:55,940 --> 03:45:59,540
After an exhausting experience studying the elite spies,

4194
03:45:59,540 --> 03:46:03,740
the cast gets some down time...

4195
03:46:04,320 --> 03:46:06,830
Let me introduce to you

4196
03:46:07,560 --> 03:46:09,350
GIA's dog mascot

4197
03:46:09,350 --> 03:46:14,900
Spy Dog "Bond"

4198
03:46:09,480 --> 03:46:11,610
Spy Dog, Bond-kun

4199
03:46:12,400 --> 03:46:14,440
He works as one of the elite spies

4200
03:46:14,680 --> 03:46:16,590
A "Super Dog"

4201
03:46:16,590 --> 03:46:18,810
Look what he's capable of

4202
03:46:23,900 --> 03:46:28,510
Showcases His Skateboarding Skill

4203
03:46:29,200 --> 03:46:30,220
How do you like that?

4204
03:46:31,950 --> 03:46:33,870
Well, he's not coming back

4205
03:46:33,870 --> 03:46:34,780
Let's go then

4206
03:46:37,020 --> 03:46:40,220
That made me feel better than anything we've done today

4207
03:46:40,220 --> 03:46:41,750
Was he supposed to come back?

4208
03:46:43,440 --> 03:46:46,270
Ah, there he is

4209
03:46:46,270 --> 03:46:48,280
He is here after all

4210
03:46:48,280 --> 03:46:50,550
Let's go then

4211
03:46:50,720 --> 03:46:54,530
Here's Bond-kun, he's here

4212
03:46:55,040 --> 03:46:57,330
That's Bond-kun?

4213
03:46:55,790 --> 03:46:57,380
He seems to like us

4214
03:46:58,410 --> 03:47:00,180
I guess we can take him back...

4215
03:47:00,180 --> 03:47:01,340
Look, he can walk on two

4216
03:47:02,740 --> 03:47:05,960
We should invite him to our room since he's so friendly

4217
03:47:05,960 --> 03:47:07,420
He's rather large...

4218
03:47:08,800 --> 03:47:11,080
I remember him being much smaller

4219
03:47:11,080 --> 03:47:13,400
I wish I can remember what he looked like before

4220
03:47:13,880 --> 03:47:16,330
Let's invite him into our room

4221
03:47:16,220 --> 03:47:18,550
I didn't know he could walk upright

4222
03:47:17,790 --> 03:47:18,740
Right, he is

4223
03:47:18,850 --> 03:47:20,670
He's walking like a human

4224
03:47:20,670 --> 03:47:22,510
He was on skateboard on all four though

4225
03:47:22,510 --> 03:47:29,200
Well, I saw Bond-kun try to walk on all fours and then he stood up

4226
03:47:29,290 --> 03:47:32,100
At least he tried to walk on four legs...

4227
03:47:50,490 --> 03:47:51,700
That's a good one

4228
03:47:52,380 --> 03:47:54,540
Nice hit!

4229
03:47:58,310 --> 03:48:02,610
The back of his head is completely open though

4230
03:48:04,260 --> 03:48:05,440
Bow!

4231
03:48:06,240 --> 03:48:07,280
Bow!

4232
03:48:07,200 --> 03:48:08,310
Bow, bow!!

4233
03:48:11,490 --> 03:48:14,500
So he really is jumpy

4234
03:48:14,860 --> 03:48:17,860
I admit I got scared but...

4235
03:48:18,040 --> 03:48:18,940
Good

4236
03:48:19,760 --> 03:48:21,840
Bow!

4237
03:48:20,500 --> 03:48:26,650
Provoked by the Punishers

4238
03:48:21,840 --> 03:48:24,050
Bow!

4239
03:48:25,260 --> 03:48:28,540
What kind of reality are we in right now?

4240
03:48:32,000 --> 03:48:33,460
Me too?

4241
03:48:34,700 --> 03:48:37,550
Matsumoto busted out laughing, too

4242
03:48:37,630 --> 03:48:39,510
No, I just pointed it out

4243
03:48:43,310 --> 03:48:46,480
He doesn't like strangers

4244
03:48:50,560 --> 03:48:52,540
We're OK now

4245
03:48:53,270 --> 03:48:56,030
Don't worry, nobody's coming back

4246
03:49:01,840 --> 03:49:04,230
We're OK now

4247
03:49:04,590 --> 03:49:06,750
You don't need to run away

4248
03:49:13,280 --> 03:49:16,680
Why don't you go with them then?

4249
03:49:19,690 --> 03:49:22,820
Everyone, this isn't the real Bond-kun

4250
03:49:25,180 --> 03:49:27,890
I'm Bond....

4251
03:49:28,030 --> 03:49:32,650
No, you thought I was the Spy Dog

4252
03:49:36,110 --> 03:49:38,310
What the hell...?

4253
03:49:38,420 --> 03:49:41,350
Gaki Members!!

4254
03:49:45,710 --> 03:49:47,930
I wish he got that right

4255
03:49:48,090 --> 03:49:50,160
You guys wish you....could...

4256
03:49:50,160 --> 03:49:52,140
could be this good

4257
03:49:52,190 --> 03:49:53,860
We should go

4258
03:49:54,520 --> 03:49:55,980
I knew it was him again

4259
03:49:57,020 --> 03:50:00,310
Honestly, I knew all along

4260
03:50:03,810 --> 03:50:06,420
Let's see the back flip again, it's been while

4261
03:50:06,420 --> 03:50:08,720
Serious?

4262
03:50:10,670 --> 03:50:13,400
From where should I have him take off?

4263
03:50:17,250 --> 03:50:20,310
Hamada Action Figure

4264
03:50:22,480 --> 03:50:23,270
Wait a sec

4265
03:50:24,450 --> 03:50:26,370
You were smiling, too!

4266
03:50:26,430 --> 03:50:28,740
No, I wasn't at all

4267
03:50:28,740 --> 03:50:30,500
Tanaka, you're guilty, too!

4268
03:50:32,140 --> 03:50:33,030
No, sir

4269
03:50:32,770 --> 03:50:33,620
Nice hit!

4270
03:50:34,440 --> 03:50:35,520
No sir

4271
03:50:36,370 --> 03:50:37,690
Not one bit

4272
03:50:37,950 --> 03:50:41,220
First of all, this is already...

4273
03:50:47,230 --> 03:50:48,660
Nice physique

4274
03:50:48,660 --> 03:50:50,710
Why was he put away in that pose?

4275
03:50:53,340 --> 03:50:54,190
I don't like this

4276
03:50:54,410 --> 03:50:56,660
I found him that way in the drawer

4277
03:50:56,660 --> 03:50:57,870
He looks sharp

4278
03:50:58,870 --> 03:51:00,590
Seriously, it was like that already

4279
03:51:01,480 --> 03:51:03,460
Another great hit

4280
03:51:05,470 --> 03:51:06,910
Good, really good

4281
03:51:08,740 --> 03:51:10,050
He's become a stud

4282
03:51:21,060 --> 03:51:23,060
Why did that crack us up so bad?

4283
03:51:34,810 --> 03:51:37,660
He looks cool doing that, right?

4284
03:51:37,660 --> 03:51:40,060
And that makes it funny

4285
03:51:40,060 --> 03:51:41,620
He's got that perfect body

4286
03:51:41,620 --> 03:51:43,600
Right, the perfect body

4287
03:51:44,880 --> 03:51:48,990
Why the hell do you have so many paper cups?

4288
03:51:47,490 --> 03:51:52,730
Well, I'm a little curious about the Suga-Tea

4289
03:51:52,730 --> 03:51:56,260
Since there's so many, can I go ahead and fix them for you guys?

4290
03:51:53,150 --> 03:52:01,980
Suga Tea

4291
03:51:56,260 --> 03:51:57,670
I don't want any

4292
03:51:57,670 --> 03:51:59,350
No, thanks

4293
03:51:59,350 --> 03:52:00,780
I don't want it either

4294
03:52:00,780 --> 03:52:02,110
Well, since they're all here...

4295
03:52:02,160 --> 03:52:04,560
I'm fixing them!

4296
03:52:17,920 --> 03:52:21,350
Why do we have to drink it against our will?

4297
03:52:20,630 --> 03:52:22,390
I don't know why he wants all of us involved...

4298
03:52:24,650 --> 03:52:26,000
I'd rather drink one as a group

4299
03:52:26,000 --> 03:52:28,040
Why not?

4300
03:52:29,740 --> 03:52:31,630
This looks sketchy

4301
03:52:31,460 --> 03:52:32,970
I think they're all same flavor

4302
03:52:32,810 --> 03:52:34,060
This isn't the same as last year's

4303
03:52:32,810 --> 03:52:38,040
Matsumoto heads to the restroom

4304
03:52:34,440 --> 03:52:36,380
It was Tonkotsu soup last year

4305
03:52:36,380 --> 03:52:38,410
That's right, the ramen soup

4306
03:52:40,200 --> 03:52:43,220
I told you I don't want it

4307
03:52:47,200 --> 03:52:49,270
What the hell am I smelling?

4308
03:52:48,980 --> 03:52:50,520
Will you try it?

4309
03:52:50,520 --> 03:52:56,420
When he comes back we should tell Matsumoto-san the tea tastes good

4310
03:52:57,210 --> 03:52:59,140
What a jerk

4311
03:52:59,140 --> 03:53:01,680
I see

4312
03:53:01,680 --> 03:53:03,000
I see

4313
03:53:03,580 --> 03:53:04,700
It makes sense

4314
03:53:05,130 --> 03:53:09,220
It isn't bad compared to last year's

4315
03:53:10,590 --> 03:53:11,850
What's this?

4316
03:53:11,850 --> 03:53:13,740
Suga-Tea

4317
03:53:13,740 --> 03:53:16,380
It isn't bad at all

4318
03:53:16,380 --> 03:53:19,420
I think everyone agrees

4319
03:53:25,740 --> 03:53:28,810
I don't want it

4320
03:53:28,810 --> 03:53:30,340
It's good though, right?

4321
03:53:30,400 --> 03:53:33,890
Let me see you have a sip then?

4322
03:53:33,970 --> 03:53:35,150
I already had some

4323
03:53:35,190 --> 03:53:37,490
Have another sip then

4324
03:53:37,490 --> 03:53:40,560
Yama-chan, finish what you've started

4325
03:53:41,630 --> 03:53:43,140
I'll have some then

4326
03:53:48,270 --> 03:53:54,120
Suga-Tea = Super Hot Ramen Oil

4327
03:53:59,400 --> 03:54:02,750
Well, it's palatable

4328
03:54:00,250 --> 03:54:02,410
Cut the bullshit, idiot!

4329
03:54:06,930 --> 03:54:08,960
I admit that was funny

4330
03:54:08,960 --> 03:54:10,610
But I held it in

4331
03:54:11,820 --> 03:54:12,860
Grab a tissue

4332
03:54:12,860 --> 03:54:15,160
Yama-chan, find some tissues

4333
03:54:17,400 --> 03:54:19,120
They're hitting us harder

4334
03:54:27,770 --> 03:54:30,030
Well, it didn't look right in the first place

4335
03:54:30,240 --> 03:54:34,220
Why don't you guys enjoy some coffee?

4336
03:54:33,980 --> 03:54:34,750
That's random

4337
03:54:35,150 --> 03:54:39,810
Coffee Service

4338
03:54:37,360 --> 03:54:38,650
But why coffee?

4339
03:54:39,810 --> 03:54:41,020
Is this a trick?

4340
03:54:41,630 --> 03:54:43,020
No, there's no trick to this

4341
03:54:51,140 --> 03:54:52,530
Well, OK, I'm OUT but...

4342
03:54:53,580 --> 03:54:55,010
What the hell was that for?

4343
03:54:57,900 --> 03:54:59,110
Sorry, Matsumoto-san

4344
03:54:59,170 --> 03:55:01,590
Let's get you into the bath to clean up

4345
03:55:01,590 --> 03:55:03,360
Right away

4346
03:55:03,360 --> 03:55:05,030
What a pain...

4347
03:55:05,600 --> 03:55:09,860
Endou, you stink, you need to hit the bath too

4348
03:55:09,860 --> 03:55:15,690
Matsumoto and Endou Hit the Bath

4349
03:55:15,690 --> 03:55:17,600
The way this story unfolded was...

4350
03:55:18,090 --> 03:55:19,580
Just the two of us?

4351
03:55:18,590 --> 03:55:19,580
I'm scared...

4352
03:55:19,580 --> 03:55:21,120
You know it's a setup, right?

4353
03:55:21,200 --> 03:55:23,050
I'm sure it's...

4354
03:55:23,050 --> 03:55:24,250
No way, it's nothing

4355
03:55:24,250 --> 03:55:27,190
It was too awkward

4356
03:55:27,190 --> 03:55:31,250
Imagine that you're suddenly told you "stink"

4357
03:55:32,200 --> 03:55:35,630
Seriously, what's gonna happen to us?

4358
03:55:38,710 --> 03:55:39,450
Come right in here

4359
03:55:39,450 --> 03:55:41,580
And get changed over there

4360
03:55:42,660 --> 03:55:43,610
What's going on here?

4361
03:55:43,610 --> 03:55:45,640
There's a hot bath ready for you

4362
03:55:45,170 --> 03:55:46,710
We're bathing for real?

4363
03:55:47,440 --> 03:55:50,960
I wonder what's going on at the bath?

4364
03:55:51,160 --> 03:55:53,390
Something's fishy

4365
03:55:54,730 --> 03:55:58,190
That transition was not smooth

4366
03:55:58,410 --> 03:55:59,770
We can bathe here?

4367
03:55:59,770 --> 03:56:00,990
Please, go ahead

4368
03:56:04,050 --> 03:56:05,070
Man, I'm cold

4369
03:56:05,250 --> 03:56:06,950
Extremely cold

4370
03:56:14,440 --> 03:56:17,150
Wow!!

4371
03:56:14,770 --> 03:56:17,150
It's freezing!

4372
03:56:17,870 --> 03:56:20,040
Man, it scared me!

4373
03:56:20,040 --> 03:56:21,280
That's a big bath!

4374
03:56:28,550 --> 03:56:33,670
Female Guests Join

4375
03:56:28,890 --> 03:56:30,070
That's a big bath!

4376
03:56:34,030 --> 03:56:35,580
Let's get in quick

4377
03:56:36,600 --> 03:56:39,340
It's nice and warm!

4378
03:56:47,350 --> 03:56:53,820
Asian

4379
03:56:47,350 --> 03:56:53,820
Azusa Babazono

4380
03:56:47,350 --> 03:56:53,820
Harisenbon

4381
03:56:47,350 --> 03:56:53,820
Haruna Kendou

4382
03:56:47,380 --> 03:56:48,620
This feels nice

4383
03:56:48,620 --> 03:56:53,600
This is the perfect way to wind down from a long day, isn't it?

4384
03:56:50,230 --> 03:56:52,130
So the girls pretend to not see you?

4385
03:56:54,340 --> 03:56:56,120
Did you get a haircut?

4386
03:56:56,120 --> 03:56:57,620
Your hairstyle changes a lot

4387
03:56:57,660 --> 03:57:00,690
Well, I cut it maybe once every other week

4388
03:57:00,730 --> 03:57:02,830
That's a lot

4389
03:57:02,390 --> 03:57:07,210
Ignore the men and have "Girl Talk"

4390
03:57:04,890 --> 03:57:06,780
I get a hair cut maybe once a month

4391
03:57:06,770 --> 03:57:08,370
You must be perverted then

4392
03:57:08,370 --> 03:57:09,750
Cut it out!

4393
03:57:13,640 --> 03:57:16,840
Tomochika

4394
03:57:20,190 --> 03:57:23,010
I wish you guys invited me

4395
03:57:28,940 --> 03:57:29,600
See?

4396
03:57:29,610 --> 03:57:32,000
Something is going on at the bath

4397
03:57:32,300 --> 03:57:34,660
Somebody must be there then

4398
03:57:34,890 --> 03:57:36,430
There must be

4399
03:57:43,230 --> 03:57:48,390
Yama-chan, since the focus is on them, I bet we can laugh all we want

4400
03:57:48,630 --> 03:57:50,980
Tanaka, go ahead and laugh

4401
03:57:50,980 --> 03:57:53,580
I'll join you, too

4402
03:57:53,520 --> 03:57:56,820
You swear you'll laugh if I do?

4403
03:57:55,700 --> 03:57:56,310
Yeah

4404
03:58:01,380 --> 03:58:03,040
See?

4405
03:58:03,840 --> 03:58:04,780
We're so SAFE

4406
03:58:04,780 --> 03:58:08,890
They're busy with the bath

4407
03:58:07,370 --> 03:58:08,600
Go ahead, Zaki-san

4408
03:58:11,020 --> 03:58:14,150
See, I'm SAFE

4409
03:58:15,220 --> 03:58:19,840
Wow, laughing is no problem

4410
03:58:26,720 --> 03:58:29,190
You're spared, Hamada-san

4411
03:58:29,230 --> 03:58:31,200
How did you get away with that?

4412
03:58:32,130 --> 03:58:32,760
Bang!

4413
03:58:33,300 --> 03:58:36,090
He hit the chair

4414
03:58:36,110 --> 03:58:37,120
He hit the chair instead

4415
03:58:37,160 --> 03:58:38,800
I felt nothing

4416
03:58:38,860 --> 03:58:41,160
He just hit the chair

4417
03:58:39,490 --> 03:58:40,520
You got lucky

4418
03:58:41,350 --> 03:58:45,920
You know I carry Hichimi Spice in my purse

4419
03:58:45,600 --> 03:58:47,150
You mean Capsaicin

4420
03:58:45,600 --> 03:58:47,150
You mean Capsaicin

4421
03:58:48,640 --> 03:58:51,130
Excuse me

4422
03:58:51,130 --> 03:58:55,120
Rubbing Endou's leg

4423
03:58:55,120 --> 03:58:56,650
That's not fair, right?

4424
03:59:19,380 --> 03:59:21,530
Do you guys have a favorite place to visit?

4425
03:59:22,650 --> 03:59:24,320
I go back and visit my old schools

4426
03:59:24,050 --> 03:59:25,010
School?

4427
03:59:25,010 --> 03:59:25,710
School?

4428
03:59:26,220 --> 03:59:28,710
They're places that remind me

4429
03:59:28,710 --> 03:59:32,670
who I am and how I got to be here

4430
03:59:32,670 --> 03:59:33,420
I see, you said "school!"

4431
03:59:33,210 --> 03:59:36,970
What'd you think I meant?

4432
03:59:39,050 --> 03:59:42,310
It's a place where I can better understand myself and...

4433
03:59:42,310 --> 03:59:45,490
where I can come to terms with things...

4434
03:59:45,700 --> 03:59:46,900
and be thankful...

4435
03:59:56,480 --> 03:59:59,220
What a pain in the ass

4436
04:00:02,610 --> 04:00:03,710
How many times do we...

4437
04:00:06,820 --> 04:00:09,310
What is this all about?

4438
04:00:09,380 --> 04:00:11,240
What is going on here?

4439
04:00:15,680 --> 04:00:18,390
Haruna, people must say you're looking good these days?

4440
04:00:18,740 --> 04:00:19,570
Ah

4441
04:00:19,940 --> 04:00:21,130
Ah

4442
04:00:21,130 --> 04:00:22,880
Ah

4443
04:00:29,530 --> 04:00:31,440
Can we be excused, please?

4444
04:00:31,920 --> 04:00:34,440
Can we go now?

4445
04:00:34,440 --> 04:00:36,300
Seriously, I've had enough of them

4446
04:00:39,000 --> 04:00:40,820
Forgive me, please

4447
04:00:42,750 --> 04:00:46,310
It's been 14 and a half hours since the start

4448
04:00:46,350 --> 04:00:48,340
Time to meet THAT guy

4449
04:00:48,340 --> 04:00:49,710
Hello, everyone

4450
04:00:49,970 --> 04:00:52,300
Agent

4451
04:00:49,970 --> 04:00:52,300
Seiji Chihara (Chihara Bros.)

4452
04:00:53,030 --> 04:00:55,050
So this is how it is

4453
04:00:55,100 --> 04:00:56,050
What do you you want?

4454
04:00:56,130 --> 04:00:58,190
Fujiwara told me to come here

4455
04:00:58,190 --> 04:01:00,660
And sit right in this chair

4456
04:01:03,530 --> 04:01:04,540
Read that

4457
04:01:04,540 --> 04:01:05,310
OK

4458
04:01:07,780 --> 04:01:09,320
(Letter from Fujiwara)
Listen, guys

4459
04:01:09,620 --> 04:01:15,050
I sent Seiji to liven an otherwise the boring five members

4460
04:01:15,550 --> 04:01:21,330
During "Seiji Time," only he is allowed to laugh

4461
04:01:21,470 --> 04:01:26,650
Seiji is to stay there until told otherwise

4462
04:01:27,190 --> 04:01:28,620
Did you get that?

4463
04:01:28,760 --> 04:01:32,230
But why would we want your ass in here?

4464
04:01:31,280 --> 04:01:32,320
What's wrong with me??

4465
04:01:33,190 --> 04:01:36,440
The air in here is surprisingly stuffy, huh?

4466
04:01:36,630 --> 04:01:39,010
I don't know what you were expecting...

4467
04:01:39,010 --> 04:01:41,890
I see, you're the feisty one

4468
04:01:44,670 --> 04:01:47,610
Yeah, very feisty

4469
04:01:47,640 --> 04:01:51,050
We have no idea what's happening outside this building

4470
04:01:51,050 --> 04:01:54,550
Is there anything big going on outside?

4471
04:01:53,560 --> 04:01:54,560
I heard this yesterday

4472
04:01:54,560 --> 04:01:56,550
in the green room

4473
04:01:57,760 --> 04:01:59,000
from Kawashima

4474
04:01:57,840 --> 04:02:05,110
Wild Bomb - Kawashima

4475
04:01:59,000 --> 04:01:59,980
Ku-chan?

4476
04:01:59,510 --> 04:02:00,700
Right Ku-chan,

4477
04:02:00,750 --> 04:02:05,460
he said he almost lost it at the "Sanma Goten" TV show

4478
04:02:10,000 --> 04:02:11,600
He didn't answer my question

4479
04:02:11,600 --> 04:02:13,410
That's not what we were asking

4480
04:02:13,440 --> 04:02:16,160
That's not news worthy

4481
04:02:16,290 --> 04:02:17,800
We were looking for real news

4482
04:02:18,250 --> 04:02:19,840
Way to go!

4483
04:02:19,840 --> 04:02:21,140
Nice!

4484
04:02:22,030 --> 04:02:23,920
Does it hurt your butt?

4485
04:02:23,820 --> 04:02:26,080
Yes, it really does hurt

4486
04:02:26,400 --> 04:02:29,450
Whose ass looks the most bruised?

4487
04:02:29,450 --> 04:02:33,380
Well, not everyone turns red at the same rate...

4488
04:02:32,280 --> 04:02:35,340
OK, that's true, but whose butt is the worst?

4489
04:02:34,910 --> 04:02:36,920
I'd say Tanaka

4490
04:02:36,100 --> 04:02:37,430
Let me see it

4491
04:02:37,630 --> 04:02:39,780
Let me see it

4492
04:02:40,180 --> 04:02:41,930
OK then, I was kind of curious myself...

4493
04:02:42,140 --> 04:02:44,870
He got Thai-Kicked twice

4494
04:02:45,410 --> 04:02:48,930
Get closer to Seiji

4495
04:02:49,330 --> 04:02:53,680
I bet it's in horrible shape

4496
04:02:55,030 --> 04:02:57,680
Nothing

4497
04:02:57,230 --> 04:02:58,360
Is that so?

4498
04:02:57,680 --> 04:02:59,440
See, it's perfectly fine

4499
04:03:01,930 --> 04:03:02,750
Really?

4500
04:03:03,170 --> 04:03:04,200
You got some work cut out for you

4501
04:03:04,200 --> 04:03:05,920
Seiji, stop laughing

4502
04:03:05,920 --> 04:03:07,790
I thought it'd look more bruised!

4503
04:03:07,790 --> 04:03:10,960
I was hoping for "the proof"

4504
04:03:10,960 --> 04:03:13,810
I'm sure the viewers were hoping the same

4505
04:03:13,810 --> 04:03:16,950
So it was such a let down to see a normal looking butt

4506
04:03:16,950 --> 04:03:18,910
How about you, Matsumoto-san?!

4507
04:03:19,590 --> 04:03:25,750
Why the hell do I have to show you my ass, moron?!

4508
04:03:21,900 --> 04:03:25,750
Why're you disrupting the flow? Get over here!

4509
04:03:28,340 --> 04:03:30,350
You didn't even try to hold in your laugh

4510
04:03:34,680 --> 04:03:36,630
Nice hit

4511
04:03:37,300 --> 04:03:40,790
Why do I gotta show my ass?

4512
04:03:39,460 --> 04:03:40,760
Why not? It's just an ass

4513
04:03:41,130 --> 04:03:42,420
I'd say my ass is pretty red

4514
04:03:44,740 --> 04:03:46,270
Nothing!

4515
04:03:46,560 --> 04:03:48,260
Not even slightly red

4516
04:03:47,340 --> 04:03:49,510
Why are they showing a full shot of my ass?

4517
04:03:49,890 --> 04:03:52,080
I'm just laughing like nobody's business

4518
04:03:52,080 --> 04:03:56,040
You too, Hamada!

4519
04:03:53,860 --> 04:03:55,370
I don't think so

4520
04:04:00,400 --> 04:04:01,930
No, this isn't good

4521
04:04:05,730 --> 04:04:07,560
That guy hits hard

4522
04:04:09,430 --> 04:04:10,760
Yeah, he swings really hard

4523
04:04:10,760 --> 04:04:12,420
That was one hell of a hit

4524
04:04:12,420 --> 04:04:13,820
He needs to aim better

4525
04:04:14,160 --> 04:04:19,160
Hamada, let me see it!

4526
04:04:14,880 --> 04:04:19,160
Don't be an idiot, that's never gonna happen!!

4527
04:04:25,110 --> 04:04:26,090
Seiji

4528
04:04:26,140 --> 04:04:29,840
OUT for being "too much of a half-ass"

4529
04:04:30,680 --> 04:04:31,360
What the hell?!

4530
04:04:31,360 --> 04:04:33,600
This is against the rules!!

4531
04:04:33,600 --> 04:04:36,050
Because you're a half-ass

4532
04:04:36,110 --> 04:04:37,220
Hit him with full force!

4533
04:04:41,530 --> 04:04:44,390
But you said I was exempt from the rules!

4534
04:04:45,710 --> 04:04:47,660
Yep, you laughed loud alright

4535
04:04:50,410 --> 04:04:51,950
You laughed so hard

4536
04:04:58,070 --> 04:04:59,600
As the next day approaches,

4537
04:04:59,970 --> 04:05:02,800
another annoying guest comes forth

4538
04:05:06,500 --> 04:05:10,360
Shoji Murakami

4539
04:05:18,890 --> 04:05:25,020
I just dropped out of a match...

4540
04:05:26,320 --> 04:05:29,490
But don't worry about me!

4541
04:05:29,490 --> 04:05:34,280
I'm also part of the GIA team!

4542
04:05:36,420 --> 04:05:37,420
Boy, I'm exhausted

4543
04:05:37,480 --> 04:05:40,490
I couldn't see his open-chops anymore

4544
04:05:41,220 --> 04:05:43,700
He's a wrestler

4545
04:05:45,480 --> 04:05:48,470
Am I bleeding?

4546
04:05:48,470 --> 04:05:50,840
I have Gingivitis

4547
04:05:51,160 --> 04:05:52,400
Not from the match?

4548
04:05:53,310 --> 04:05:54,370
What's your name?

4549
04:05:54,880 --> 04:05:57,480
How sweaty are you?

4550
04:06:00,350 --> 04:06:02,620
May I have your name, please?

4551
04:06:02,620 --> 04:06:06,060
I'd say this is as good as taking a bath

4552
04:06:07,980 --> 04:06:10,210
I'm Sho-chan

4553
04:06:14,930 --> 04:06:17,900
Don't you have a wrestling name??

4554
04:06:23,210 --> 04:06:28,350
I was ordered to spy on the "Wrestling Association"

4555
04:06:28,840 --> 04:06:32,760
And the chairman took a liking to me

4556
04:06:32,760 --> 04:06:35,700
I've been stuck doing this for the past 40 years

4557
04:06:36,530 --> 04:06:39,350
That's a long time

4558
04:06:38,240 --> 04:06:38,860
But anyway,

4559
04:06:40,100 --> 04:06:41,320
I found you!

4560
04:06:41,020 --> 04:06:44,830
Reiji (Nakagawa Family)

4561
04:06:41,020 --> 04:06:44,830
Wrestling Assoc. Chairman

4562
04:06:41,340 --> 04:06:42,210
Chairman!

4563
04:06:42,210 --> 04:06:43,340
Sho-chan!!

4564
04:06:43,340 --> 04:06:44,220
You can't just take off like that!

4565
04:06:44,220 --> 04:06:45,280
What're you doing?

4566
04:06:45,280 --> 04:06:47,590
Don't scare me like that!

4567
04:06:47,590 --> 04:06:51,050
Seriously, I heard that you just quit

4568
04:06:51,050 --> 04:06:52,450
Why?

4569
04:06:52,450 --> 04:06:53,640
Chairman, I can't do this anymore

4570
04:06:53,640 --> 04:06:55,010
No need to quit

4571
04:06:55,010 --> 04:06:56,300
Yes, I'm retiring

4572
04:06:56,300 --> 04:06:57,620
No, stay with it

4573
04:06:57,620 --> 04:07:00,400
Really, I'm done with it

4574
04:06:58,810 --> 04:06:59,850
Stay

4575
04:06:59,850 --> 04:07:00,410
Why?

4576
04:07:00,410 --> 04:07:02,230
We have tons of strawberries for you

4577
04:07:02,230 --> 04:07:03,950
Strawberries

4578
04:07:03,950 --> 04:07:06,040
They're super sweet, too

4579
04:07:06,550 --> 04:07:10,030
Well, you're not putting much effort into wrestling these days either

4580
04:07:10,030 --> 04:07:11,000
What do you mean?

4581
04:07:11,080 --> 04:07:12,670
I'm doing a lot for the company

4582
04:07:11,900 --> 04:07:13,190
Cut the bullcrap

4583
04:07:13,190 --> 04:07:16,940
That's not what I heard from the manager of the Gohanda Bar

4584
04:07:16,940 --> 04:07:18,740
Who?

4585
04:07:18,740 --> 04:07:20,780
The bar manager

4586
04:07:20,780 --> 04:07:22,960
Sho-chan, she's not the manager there

4587
04:07:23,480 --> 04:07:25,180
She's only an assistant manager

4588
04:07:25,180 --> 04:07:26,700
Assistant manager?

4589
04:07:26,700 --> 04:07:31,750
She wants to be the manager but the current manager's so stubborn

4590
04:07:31,750 --> 04:07:33,680
and won't give up her responsibilities

4591
04:07:33,680 --> 04:07:37,770
But she needs the assistant manager to deal with the younger employees there

4592
04:07:38,210 --> 04:07:40,650
There's a lot of confusion there,

4593
04:07:40,650 --> 04:07:42,430
and I said, "Why don't you become the manager?"

4594
04:07:42,430 --> 04:07:44,200
And she said to me,"Chairman, I don't have enough money

4595
04:07:44,200 --> 04:07:47,220
to become the manager."

4596
04:07:48,400 --> 04:07:50,390
So I told her I can cover the cost

4597
04:07:50,480 --> 04:07:52,490
I'm just throwing away money at this point

4598
04:07:55,200 --> 04:07:57,390
What's so funny?

4599
04:07:59,360 --> 04:08:00,860
What's he laughing about?

4600
04:08:01,370 --> 04:08:03,040
What's with this everyday conversation?

4601
04:08:03,040 --> 04:08:05,050
And he's just laughing away

4602
04:08:11,770 --> 04:08:13,890
What's with these two guys?

4603
04:08:14,110 --> 04:08:17,660
If you wanna talk about the assistant manager, then I have something to say

4604
04:08:17,660 --> 04:08:18,680
What do you got?

4605
04:08:18,680 --> 04:08:20,650
When you get inside the ring,

4606
04:08:20,670 --> 04:08:24,450
You have to get the crowd going, you know?

4607
04:08:24,450 --> 04:08:26,420
Yeah, to get the crowd on your side!!

4608
04:08:26,420 --> 04:08:28,130
You mean I gotta grab the microphone?

4609
04:08:28,130 --> 04:08:31,740
You know, like Antonio Inoki when he rambles about the poem "My Way"

4610
04:08:31,740 --> 04:08:34,070
Like, "Once you take this path then you gotta..."

4611
04:08:34,070 --> 04:08:36,740
But I'm already doing that

4612
04:08:36,830 --> 04:08:38,920
If you take this path here,

4613
04:08:38,920 --> 04:08:41,800
you'll get to Tamachi High Lane,

4614
04:08:41,800 --> 04:08:43,400
And hang a right there

4615
04:08:43,400 --> 04:08:46,110
And you'll see a convenience store on your right,

4616
04:08:46,110 --> 04:08:49,530
as you reach Tamachi station...

4617
04:08:49,150 --> 04:08:50,420
What the hell are you talking about?

4618
04:08:51,560 --> 04:08:53,960
Where is it?

4619
04:08:53,690 --> 04:08:55,270
What's that?

4620
04:08:55,260 --> 04:08:56,660
Well, that's what I do...

4621
04:09:06,830 --> 04:09:09,780
What is this all about?

4622
04:09:09,780 --> 04:09:11,760
So exactly where are you heading?

4623
04:09:15,610 --> 04:09:18,530
Talking to an audience isn't as easy as it sounds

4624
04:09:18,530 --> 04:09:21,070
Why don't you do my old bit?

4625
04:09:21,070 --> 04:09:24,050
When I was a wrestler

4626
04:09:24,050 --> 04:09:25,540
You wanna hear it?

4627
04:09:25,540 --> 04:09:27,570
So I'd enter the ring and say...

4628
04:09:41,760 --> 04:09:43,430
What's he trying to pull?

4629
04:09:44,570 --> 04:09:45,940
I thought I was SAFE

4630
04:09:48,640 --> 04:09:49,670
Ah, they got me!

4631
04:09:50,720 --> 04:09:53,200
What exactly are you doing?

4632
04:09:54,210 --> 04:09:56,000
What exactly are you guys up to?

4633
04:10:01,410 --> 04:10:03,090
Will you guys leave, please?

4634
04:10:03,090 --> 04:10:03,090
[Mimics Cantonese]

4635
04:10:04,710 --> 04:10:10,620
Ring Speech Continues

4636
04:10:42,100 --> 04:10:44,540
What're you doing at this hour?

4637
04:10:52,480 --> 04:10:54,180
We're not gettin' anything done here

4638
04:10:54,180 --> 04:10:55,050
Should we split?

4639
04:10:55,050 --> 04:10:55,970
Where to?

4640
04:10:55,970 --> 04:10:58,270
To that bar we've been talking about!

4641
04:11:05,140 --> 04:11:08,210
Chairman, I won't ever let you down

4642
04:11:08,430 --> 04:11:11,150
That was a lot in one sitting

4643
04:11:11,660 --> 04:11:13,750
They had that well rehearsed

4644
04:11:13,970 --> 04:11:20,500
15hrs and 30min have passed

4645
04:11:13,970 --> 04:11:20,500
The Rigorous Training Has Tested Their Strength!

4646
04:11:20,830 --> 04:11:25,460
And there's more "Laughing Assassins" on the way!

4647
04:11:27,600 --> 04:11:29,190
Many amazing things happened

4648
04:11:29,190 --> 04:11:31,610
What's up with Shin-Onii?

4649
04:11:29,990 --> 04:11:37,700
Shin-Onii

4650
04:11:31,360 --> 04:11:33,610
He was kind of scary this time

4651
04:11:33,610 --> 04:11:36,530
Don't be showing him to your kids

4652
04:11:34,950 --> 04:11:36,540
Kids will cry if they see him

4653
04:11:37,820 --> 04:11:40,530
You were in the bath longer than that, right?

4654
04:11:39,910 --> 04:11:40,860
That was a long time...

4655
04:11:40,530 --> 04:11:57,280
Co-Ed Bath

4656
04:11:42,040 --> 04:11:43,620
Listen to me...

4657
04:11:43,620 --> 04:11:47,030
Think about this, we were essentially being

4658
04:11:47,030 --> 04:11:50,090
sexually harassed by female comics

4659
04:11:50,090 --> 04:11:53,620
who are our juniors

4660
04:11:53,700 --> 04:11:55,180
What was I supposed to do?

4661
04:11:55,520 --> 04:11:58,030
I didn't get the point of it

4662
04:11:58,010 --> 04:12:02,190
This will be the last transition of the night

4663
04:11:59,250 --> 04:12:00,230
Why me?

4664
04:12:02,190 --> 04:12:03,190
What a pain!

4665
04:12:02,720 --> 04:12:04,450
Please set us up

4666
04:12:04,450 --> 04:12:07,830
WoWoW!!

4667
04:12:07,830 --> 04:12:10,650
That was a strong finish

4668
04:12:14,910 --> 04:12:17,620
The end of the training slowly approaches

4669
04:12:18,250 --> 04:12:19,210
No, really...

4670
04:12:20,110 --> 04:12:21,580
No more...

4671
04:12:21,580 --> 04:12:22,840
Listen guys

4672
04:12:23,650 --> 04:12:28,580
They're holding an event for a beautiful pop group

4673
04:12:28,580 --> 04:12:31,680
Let's go check it out

4674
04:12:31,760 --> 04:12:33,590
How does this relate to becoming a spy?

4675
04:12:33,590 --> 04:12:35,160
It doesn't relate at all

4676
04:12:35,160 --> 04:12:37,130
Well, Spy...Spy...

4677
04:12:37,130 --> 04:12:41,070
Well, the group consists of beautiful spies...

4678
04:12:40,270 --> 04:12:41,460
So they're from GIA?

4679
04:12:41,460 --> 04:12:43,080
That's right

4680
04:12:43,080 --> 04:12:44,250
Let's go check them out

4681
04:12:44,250 --> 04:12:54,160
Observe the Pop Group

4682
04:12:44,250 --> 04:12:54,160
Spy Training

4683
04:12:46,410 --> 04:12:48,790
Those actors from the play were also from GIA??

4684
04:12:49,080 --> 04:12:50,290
That's correct

4685
04:12:50,290 --> 04:12:52,960
Why didn't they just put the two acts together then?

4686
04:12:56,060 --> 04:12:57,970
We're heading back where we were before?

4687
04:12:57,970 --> 04:12:59,220
That's right

4688
04:13:00,290 --> 04:13:01,720
It's really dark out

4689
04:13:32,260 --> 04:13:33,550
Ladies and gentlemen

4690
04:13:33,550 --> 04:13:36,610
Tonight you will witness the most beautiful pop group

4691
04:13:36,610 --> 04:13:38,150
It's nothing short of a miracle!

4692
04:13:38,150 --> 04:13:39,500
They're known as

4693
04:13:39,950 --> 04:13:47,800
Beauty of the Times

4694
04:13:57,380 --> 04:14:00,140

4701
04:14:18,480 --> 04:14:19,490

4704
04:14:28,600 --> 04:14:34,100
How beautiful are we

4705
04:14:35,540 --> 04:14:41,550
A God given perfect body

4706
04:14:41,550 --> 04:14:44,880
We're gonna show it tonight

4707
04:14:51,970 --> 04:14:55,530
And I'll let you take this home

4708
04:14:55,210 --> 04:14:57,660
Right now, you can

4709
04:14:58,510 --> 04:15:00,830
Say it out loud

4710
04:15:01,250 --> 04:15:04,330
Anyone can

4711
04:15:04,760 --> 04:15:07,860
Feel free to

4712
04:15:14,290 --> 04:15:15,630
I hate that dance

4713
04:15:17,080 --> 04:15:18,620
How irritating...

4714
04:15:19,880 --> 04:15:21,370
She's too big to dance like that

4715
04:15:33,660 --> 04:15:36,620
They're the "Way Too Beautiful" Bishojo Jidai

4716
04:15:36,620 --> 04:15:38,800
What's this all about?

4717
04:15:40,170 --> 04:15:45,120
Who's more beautiful than this group representing a new era?

4718
04:15:45,120 --> 04:15:48,920
This is what their fans have been waiting for all day

4719
04:15:48,920 --> 04:15:50,190

04:16:05,840 --> 04:16:07,000
Who's up first?

4725
04:16:07,020 --> 04:16:08,900
Shizu-chan, will you pick the winner, please?

4726
04:16:08,900 --> 04:16:10,220
Go for it

4727
04:16:11,100 --> 04:16:15,180
And please come up on stage once you're chosen

4728
04:16:26,490 --> 04:16:29,530
Cut it out

4729
04:16:44,700 --> 04:16:47,180
Jeez, no

4730
04:16:53,210 --> 04:16:58,120
Hamada is the Lucky Fan

4731
04:17:01,470 --> 04:17:04,140
This is one ugly scene...

4732
04:17:03,750 --> 04:17:07,160
Let's get to the first "sexy time" gift

4733
04:17:07,160 --> 04:17:09,540

You made it?

4739
04:18:07,870 --> 04:18:09,920
Well, more or less...

4740
04:18:14,040 --> 04:18:17,590
Thank you, Shizu-chan and Oniyakko

4741
04:18:17,590 --> 04:18:19,260
Please go back to your seat

4742
04:18:20,260 --> 04:18:22,440
OK everyone, this is our last segment

4743
04:18:22,440 --> 04:18:24,810
Let's get together and...

4744
04:18:25,260 --> 04:18:26,370
Bang!!

4745
04:18:26,500 --> 04:18:30,470
Masahiro Chono Barges In!!

4746
04:18:27,900 --> 04:18:29,380
God Damn!!

4747
04:18:30,910 --> 04:18:32,060
A charming...

4748
04:18:32,080 --> 04:18:33,090
Bang!!

4749
04:18:33,800 --> 04:18:34,860
God Damn!!

4750
04:18:35,230 --> 04:18:37,230
There he is

4751
04:18:39,330 --> 04:18:42,120
Here he comes...

4752
04:18:41,120 --> 04:18:42,790
Look at you, Hosei-san!!

4753
04:18:42,520 --> 04:18:45,940
We haven't done anything, why is he here?

4754
04:18:42,790 --> 04:18:44,790
Look at your expression, Yamasaki!

4755
04:18:45,990 --> 04:18:48,740
I haven't done anything...

4756
04:18:49,190 --> 04:18:51,510
He's got nothing on us...

4757
04:18:56,310 --> 04:19:01,260
I'm in charge

4758
04:19:01,260 --> 04:19:03,740
of their production company

4759
04:19:06,010 --> 04:19:09,960
Some disturbing news was brought to my attention

4760
04:19:12,120 --> 04:19:16,640
One of you

4761
04:19:16,810 --> 04:19:19,340
has videotaped these girls

4762
04:19:19,400 --> 04:19:24,800
Pop Group was Videotaped!!

4763
04:19:24,800 --> 04:19:29,110
Ring a bell, anyone?

4764
04:19:30,700 --> 04:19:33,510
None of you, huh?

4765
04:19:39,500 --> 04:19:40,530
I see...

4766
04:19:40,530 --> 04:19:42,420
Nobody's coming clean...

4767
04:19:44,580 --> 04:19:47,030
Hey

4768
04:19:48,000 --> 04:19:49,650
Bring it in

4769
04:19:56,780 --> 04:19:59,270
This device

4770
04:19:59,740 --> 04:20:05,810
This device can detect a micro-camera

4771
04:20:09,520 --> 04:20:14,150
Criminal Search Begins

4772
04:20:26,240 --> 04:20:27,580
He's so intimidating

4773
04:20:45,720 --> 04:20:48,750
Something's not right

4774
04:20:53,030 --> 04:20:57,370
Beeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeep

4775
04:20:58,660 --> 04:21:04,000
Criminal Found!!

4776
04:21:01,890 --> 04:21:03,550
I knew it, but it was still funny

4777
04:21:04,540 --> 04:21:07,280
It was funny even though we knew the outcome

4778
04:21:09,970 --> 04:21:13,740
I think I was more relieved than anything...

4779
04:21:14,630 --> 04:21:18,280
There's always that "What if it's me?" feeling...

4780
04:21:17,110 --> 04:21:18,050
Is that so?

4781
04:21:19,960 --> 04:21:22,570
Hey!

4782
04:21:22,570 --> 04:21:24,640
Why don't you get up?

4783
04:21:25,380 --> 04:21:29,870
I did not videotape those girls

4784
04:21:27,900 --> 04:21:29,600
I don't care, stand up

4785
04:21:29,870 --> 04:21:32,010
I want to check you again

4786
04:21:33,320 --> 04:21:34,700
Now you have no excuse

4787
04:21:34,720 --> 04:21:35,890
Let me see it!

4788
04:21:37,110 --> 04:21:38,750
How do I show you when I don't know...

4789
04:21:38,750 --> 04:21:40,380
Where is the camera?

4790
04:21:40,380 --> 04:21:41,450
I don't have it...

4791
04:21:41,450 --> 04:21:43,870
Yama-chan, is that it?

4792
04:21:43,970 --> 04:21:46,470
That pen!!

4793
04:21:46,590 --> 04:21:49,180
What the hell is that?

4794
04:21:49,930 --> 04:21:53,600
Well, we all got the same pens

4795
04:21:54,740 --> 04:21:56,580
Not beeping though

4796
04:21:57,020 --> 04:21:58,990
No beep over here

4797
04:21:58,990 --> 04:21:59,900
No beep

4798
04:22:03,570 --> 04:22:05,590
Why is that beeping?

4799
04:22:06,520 --> 04:22:09,880
Check this pen

4800
04:22:11,260 --> 04:22:13,460
Don't be playing "Spy" behind my back

4801
04:22:14,070 --> 04:22:21,500
Yamasaki's Pen

4802
04:22:14,330 --> 04:22:18,540
What appears to be a normal pen

4803
04:22:19,750 --> 04:22:20,810
actually has

4804
04:22:21,180 --> 04:22:25,380
the micro-camera is installed

4805
04:22:22,340 --> 04:22:25,830
A Micro Video camera Installed Inside

4806
04:22:25,890 --> 04:22:30,720
A tool commonly used among criminals

4807
04:22:25,910 --> 04:22:28,870
It's widely used by criminals

4808
04:22:31,990 --> 04:22:33,610
I'm checking what's saved in that pen

4809
04:22:33,610 --> 04:22:38,200
Reveal the Pen's Contents

4810
04:22:34,760 --> 04:22:37,810
If you just came clean, we wouldn't have to resort to this

4811
04:22:39,650 --> 04:22:42,810
Is this what you do all the time?

4812
04:22:41,300 --> 04:22:42,550
No, sir

4813
04:22:42,570 --> 04:22:43,600
No way

4814
04:22:43,720 --> 04:22:45,470
You look like the type

4815
04:22:45,470 --> 04:22:48,240
who chases around young girls

4816
04:22:47,380 --> 04:22:49,380
No, sir, not at all

4817
04:22:49,400 --> 04:22:51,090
You've never come to this type of event?

4818
04:22:50,310 --> 04:22:51,180
Never

4819
04:22:51,180 --> 04:22:52,370
I never have, sir

4820
04:22:52,370 --> 04:22:55,440
You were never into these pop groups?

4821
04:22:53,030 --> 04:22:54,830
Never!!

4822
04:22:55,390 --> 04:22:58,380
Yamasaki Pleads His Innocence

4823
04:22:55,710 --> 04:22:57,610
You can't hide anything from me

4824
04:22:58,290 --> 04:23:00,330
If that pen is one of those high-tech micro cameras

4825
04:23:00,760 --> 04:23:03,790
then it will contain the footage I'm after

4826
04:23:03,790 --> 04:23:06,520
And it can be played back

4827
04:23:06,520 --> 04:23:07,870
Let's check it out

4828
04:23:07,530 --> 04:23:12,100
Inspection Starts

4829
04:23:16,980 --> 04:23:19,690
You did videotape them

4830
04:23:19,870 --> 04:23:20,600
Where is this?

4831
04:23:29,070 --> 04:23:31,950
No way...

4832
04:23:41,030 --> 04:23:43,270
What're you doing?

4833
04:23:48,740 --> 04:23:50,340
Wait, wait, wait,

4834
04:23:50,340 --> 04:23:52,570
Wait, wait, wait

4835
04:23:57,700 --> 04:24:03,140
Video Showing Girls Changing in a Locker Room

4836
04:24:03,660 --> 04:24:06,970
Guilty of Being a Peeping Tom

4837
04:24:12,160 --> 04:24:14,720
But why would you videotape them...

4838
04:24:20,640 --> 04:24:21,320
Hey!

4839
04:24:24,340 --> 04:24:26,740
What now?

4840
04:24:27,750 --> 04:24:29,600
I'm absolutely sure...

4841
04:24:28,680 --> 04:24:29,590
What now?

4842
04:24:29,590 --> 04:24:30,910
Yes, give me a second

4843
04:24:30,910 --> 04:24:32,420
OK, you just confessed

4844
04:24:32,170 --> 04:24:33,080
Wait

4845
04:24:32,590 --> 04:24:34,240
Come on up on stage

4846
04:24:34,040 --> 04:24:39,400
Bitch Slap Warranted for the Criminal!!!

4847
04:24:36,340 --> 04:24:39,200
I'm completely flabbergasted right now!

4848
04:24:40,090 --> 04:24:41,290
Get up here

4849
04:24:44,460 --> 04:24:47,250
Give me a minute, please?

4850
04:24:48,400 --> 04:24:50,540
Seriously, why me...??

4851
04:24:54,290 --> 04:24:55,550
Can you hang on a second, please?

4852
04:24:57,020 --> 04:25:00,680
Yama-chan, get this over with

4853
04:25:00,680 --> 04:25:02,140
Hosei-san, please

4854
04:25:07,840 --> 04:25:09,070
Get over here!

4855
04:25:10,810 --> 04:25:12,180
First, apologize

4856
04:25:12,270 --> 04:25:13,390
Apologize

4857
04:25:13,390 --> 04:25:15,480
Are you saying I'm off the hook if I apologize?

4858
04:25:14,350 --> 04:25:15,160
Apologize

4859
04:25:15,230 --> 04:25:16,140
To them

4860
04:25:16,270 --> 04:25:17,550
Get up here

4861
04:25:19,030 --> 04:25:20,900
Say you're sorry first

4862
04:25:23,070 --> 04:25:24,430
Sorry

4863
04:25:24,430 --> 04:25:27,530
I'll never do it again

4864
04:25:33,590 --> 04:25:34,670
They're scared of you

4865
04:25:34,670 --> 04:25:38,040
And he's admitted...

4866
04:25:41,060 --> 04:25:42,300
Forgive me...

4867
04:25:43,730 --> 04:25:44,920
I'm sorry

4868
04:25:44,920 --> 04:25:46,530
Get over here, asshole!

4869
04:25:46,790 --> 04:25:49,810
This is a cruel punishment for such a late hour

4870
04:25:49,810 --> 04:25:50,960
Give me a second, please?

4871
04:25:50,960 --> 04:25:52,470
Seriously, I'm...

4872
04:25:58,060 --> 04:25:58,610
Ouch

4873
04:25:58,610 --> 04:25:59,150
Ouch

4874
04:25:59,150 --> 04:26:00,630
Ouch!

4875
04:26:02,490 --> 04:26:05,050
Yama-chan!

4876
04:26:05,050 --> 04:26:08,550
Yama-chan, c'mon

4877
04:26:09,410 --> 04:26:10,770
Please just do this for us

4878
04:26:10,770 --> 04:26:14,190
Give us a break

4879
04:26:16,930 --> 04:26:18,260
Hosei-san, please

4880
04:26:18,370 --> 04:26:19,830
I understand your situation but...

4881
04:26:21,750 --> 04:26:24,140
You're not being courteous to your teammates

4882
04:26:24,430 --> 04:26:27,230
Give me a moment!!

4883
04:26:27,750 --> 04:26:30,350
Is there anyway I can get out of this?

4884
04:26:30,480 --> 04:26:31,670
Jeez, year after year...

4885
04:26:31,890 --> 04:26:32,940
But you just admitted

4886
04:26:33,680 --> 04:26:36,440
Accept it like a man

4887
04:26:35,730 --> 04:26:37,560
I confessed because you said you'd let me go

4888
04:26:36,880 --> 04:26:38,710
I didn't say that

4889
04:26:38,840 --> 04:26:39,940
Don't put words into my mouth

4890
04:26:39,940 --> 04:26:41,080
Give me a second, please

4891
04:26:41,780 --> 04:26:43,510
That tie is a little sketchy, too

4892
04:26:43,510 --> 04:26:45,210
You hiding something under there, too?

4893
04:26:45,240 --> 04:26:47,320
It's easy to grab onto you

4894
04:27:00,430 --> 04:27:03,190
Why're you fighting it?

4895
04:27:07,770 --> 04:27:09,270
Please, please, please, help me!

4896
04:27:09,630 --> 04:27:10,330
I don't want it

4897
04:27:12,410 --> 04:27:13,730
I can't do this

4898
04:27:17,660 --> 04:27:19,020
Get the hell up

4899
04:27:19,220 --> 04:27:20,940
What's wrong with your eyes?

4900
04:27:20,590 --> 04:27:21,500
Get up

4901
04:27:21,500 --> 04:27:23,360
But I'm really exhausted

4902
04:27:23,540 --> 04:27:25,600
You got a nice pair of shoes, huh?

4903
04:27:36,490 --> 04:27:37,840
You had zero strength left

4904
04:27:37,840 --> 04:27:39,300
Right, I had none

4905
04:27:42,720 --> 04:27:43,870
That's the funniest

4906
04:27:45,830 --> 04:27:49,670
How about a slap with his left hand...?

4907
04:27:50,600 --> 04:27:52,110
Well, I'm not making that decision but...

4908
04:27:53,200 --> 04:27:56,460
Could you use your left hand, please?

4909
04:27:56,460 --> 04:27:59,470
No punching though, no way!!

4910
04:28:00,290 --> 04:28:01,520
Get up

4911
04:28:02,720 --> 04:28:04,210
OK, I'm ready

4912
04:28:05,620 --> 04:28:07,150
Now, apologize to everyone here

4913
04:28:07,150 --> 04:28:09,310
Tell them you're sorry

4914
04:28:10,100 --> 04:28:11,440
I don't have all day

4915
04:28:12,540 --> 04:28:14,450
First, apologize

4916
04:28:16,690 --> 04:28:17,660
Say you're sorry

4917
04:28:20,110 --> 04:28:22,580
Apologize, asshole!!

4918
04:28:22,420 --> 04:28:25,260
Noooooo~, This is just terrifying

4919
04:28:31,800 --> 04:28:34,550
Please, I need to save my butt

4920
04:28:37,590 --> 04:28:39,530
I'm really hating this...

4921
04:28:40,320 --> 04:28:41,760
OK, time's up

4922
04:28:42,880 --> 04:28:43,670
Your time is up

4923
04:28:43,670 --> 04:28:46,090
There's no way for us to help you so...

4924
04:28:44,990 --> 04:28:46,060
They're right about that

4925
04:28:47,830 --> 04:28:48,460
Ready?

4926
04:28:48,730 --> 04:28:49,600
Close your eyes

4927
04:28:50,130 --> 04:28:51,310
I'll do it

4928
04:28:51,870 --> 04:28:53,860
Please, wait for my count

4929
04:28:53,940 --> 04:28:55,840
How dare you...asshole...?!

4930
04:29:02,760 --> 04:29:04,590
C'mon now

4931
04:29:04,590 --> 04:29:06,540
Do you realize how many times we're getting slapped?

4932
04:29:06,390 --> 04:29:09,560
How many times are we gonna get hit here?

4933
04:29:12,540 --> 04:29:13,550
Just get over here

4934
04:29:14,680 --> 04:29:15,540
OK, I'm ready for real

4935
04:29:15,540 --> 04:29:17,780
I'm not waiting for you

4936
04:29:17,780 --> 04:29:19,890
OK, OK, then wait...

4937
04:29:22,270 --> 04:29:24,290
I'll accept the punishment

4938
04:29:24,680 --> 04:29:25,100
But,

4939
04:29:25,800 --> 04:29:29,970
could you do it after i count to three, please?

4940
04:29:29,970 --> 04:29:31,660
Don't screw with me, asshole!

4941
04:29:31,660 --> 04:29:33,070
Get over to this side

4942
04:29:35,030 --> 04:29:36,210
Ready?

4943
04:30:08,780 --> 04:30:10,190
That must have hurt

4944
04:30:10,190 --> 04:30:11,630
Yes, it did

4945
04:30:14,600 --> 04:30:16,120
I'm sick and tired of you, asshole!

4946
04:30:16,120 --> 04:30:17,550
Get the hell out of here!

4947
04:30:31,790 --> 04:30:34,110
Let's go

4948
04:30:36,200 --> 04:30:39,560
Why did you bother videotaping THEM?

4949
04:30:41,580 --> 04:30:44,390
They sure despise you

4950
04:30:46,270 --> 04:30:48,830
After 17 hours of training,

4951
04:30:48,900 --> 04:30:53,830
their physical and mental strength have been long gone,

4952
04:30:53,830 --> 04:30:56,780
But it's time for their last mission

4953
04:31:01,210 --> 04:31:02,780
Attention, guys

4954
04:31:03,280 --> 04:31:06,280
It's finally time to prove

4955
04:31:06,280 --> 04:31:08,690
what you learned today

4956
04:31:08,690 --> 04:31:14,330
I need you to find the bomb hidden in the building

4957
04:31:14,330 --> 04:31:17,210
as well as find and rescue a kidnapped girl

4958
04:31:17,230 --> 04:31:18,290
I'm counting on you

4959
04:31:18,370 --> 04:31:20,030
Are we good enough?

4960
04:31:20,030 --> 04:31:26,000
Also, you may now laugh but don't become scared or startled

4961
04:31:26,120 --> 04:31:27,680
Take note of that, too

4962
04:31:28,870 --> 04:31:33,660
Don't Get Scared   -   Spy

4963
04:31:28,870 --> 04:31:33,660
Middle of the Night Special Rule

4964
04:31:33,850 --> 04:31:40,960
Disarm a Bomb in a 2nd Floor Office in the Annex

4965
04:31:39,830 --> 04:31:41,730
That's right after you got slapped

4966
04:31:40,960 --> 04:31:47,030
Rescue the Director's Kidnapped Daughter!!

4967
04:31:47,990 --> 04:31:52,230
Here's some walkie-talkies

4968
04:31:52,420 --> 04:31:59,880
Distribution of Walkie-Talkies

4969
04:31:53,460 --> 04:31:59,220
Wrist-Watch style Walkie Talkies are distributed for communication

4970
04:32:00,510 --> 04:32:06,160
Bomb Disarming Kit

4971
04:32:01,390 --> 04:32:04,770
A bomb-disarming kit is also provided

4972
04:32:04,980 --> 04:32:06,500
How did you set this up?

4973
04:32:06,520 --> 04:32:08,940
Why don't you start your mission?

4974
04:32:09,290 --> 04:32:10,820
You'll know what to do once you step out

4975
04:32:11,250 --> 04:32:14,780
You need to rescue the kidnapped girl

4976
04:32:15,820 --> 04:32:17,860
That's a huge mission...

4977
04:32:18,530 --> 04:32:21,770
Ah, here's this lighting again

4978
04:32:21,150 --> 04:32:24,520
Complete Lighting Change

4979
04:32:23,970 --> 04:32:25,090
This is already freaky

4980
04:32:25,460 --> 04:32:29,610
CO2 Gas Release

4981
04:32:26,640 --> 04:32:28,780
And it's freezing out here too

4982
04:32:34,990 --> 04:32:36,530
Hey, Tanaka

4983
04:32:36,610 --> 04:32:37,400
There he goes again

4984
04:32:37,430 --> 04:32:38,380
losing his cool

4985
04:32:38,480 --> 04:32:39,490
Why you?

4986
04:32:39,590 --> 04:32:41,500
This is a repeat from last year...

4987
04:32:41,580 --> 04:32:44,380
Man up or you're gonna fall down a lot

4988
04:32:44,430 --> 04:32:46,070
And be careful of the bomb kit

4989
04:32:46,070 --> 04:32:47,920
I know, but it's really heavy

4990
04:32:49,200 --> 04:32:52,370
Tanaka, get to the front

4991
04:32:52,950 --> 04:32:54,840
Can I please stay in back

4992
04:32:55,130 --> 04:32:57,390
This kit could be dangerous

4993
04:32:59,240 --> 04:33:01,410
It could fly out of your hands and hit Hamada-san

4994
04:33:01,410 --> 04:33:03,790
That would be a disaster

4995
04:33:03,790 --> 04:33:05,240
It would be a nightmare

4996
04:33:05,370 --> 04:33:07,880
We need to be on the lookout

4997
04:33:05,480 --> 04:33:09,950
"Secret" Trap

4998
04:33:13,680 --> 04:33:14,780
It's me

4999
04:33:14,780 --> 04:33:21,450
(God) (Monster Engine - Oobayashi)

5000
04:33:18,960 --> 04:33:20,230
You scared me

5001
04:33:19,570 --> 04:33:21,610
God, don't scare us like that!

5002
04:33:22,070 --> 04:33:26,950
"Secret" Trap

5003
04:33:23,760 --> 04:33:25,890
Why is he like, "It's me"?

5004
04:33:27,750 --> 04:33:28,960
Bang!

5005
04:33:29,600 --> 04:33:31,300
It's me

5006
04:33:29,640 --> 04:33:33,600
God (Monster Engine - Nishimori)

5007
04:33:34,300 --> 04:33:36,070
You better knock it off!

5008
04:33:36,170 --> 04:33:38,600
So it was you

5009
04:33:37,500 --> 04:33:40,380
I got you again

5010
04:33:38,600 --> 04:33:41,050
I'd never have guessed

5011
04:33:40,390 --> 04:33:44,080
We're bored out of our minds

5012
04:33:41,170 --> 04:33:42,410
So this is how two Gods horse around

5013
04:33:42,410 --> 04:33:44,080
So this is how two Gods horse around

5014
04:33:46,040 --> 04:33:47,180
Hey Tanaka,

5015
04:33:47,180 --> 04:33:48,100
You OK?

5016
04:33:47,570 --> 04:33:48,810
I'm OK

5017
04:33:48,900 --> 04:33:50,750
Say, "People of Lips"

5018
04:33:50,480 --> 04:33:52,040
Hold up

5019
04:33:52,560 --> 04:33:56,270
Who are you calling "People of Lips"?

5020
04:33:54,040 --> 04:33:56,270
I'm sure they're referring to Hamada-san

5021
04:33:56,570 --> 04:33:59,460
We used to be

5022
04:33:58,200 --> 04:34:01,150
the round and large

5023
04:33:59,460 --> 04:34:01,150
light forms

5024
04:34:02,350 --> 04:34:04,100
Is this some kind of code?

5025
04:34:04,100 --> 04:34:05,710
Round and large flashing object...?

5026
04:34:05,980 --> 04:34:10,260
Hold up, "People of Lips"

5027
04:34:07,270 --> 04:34:10,260
"People of Lips", hold up

5028
04:34:09,060 --> 04:34:10,160
Say it already

5029
04:34:10,800 --> 04:34:13,300
We used to be

5030
04:34:12,230 --> 04:34:14,590
the round and large

5031
04:34:13,430 --> 04:34:15,600
light forms

5032
04:34:15,330 --> 04:34:16,390
Yeah, we already got that

5033
04:34:19,720 --> 04:34:21,490
They're just repeating themselves

5034
04:34:21,570 --> 04:34:24,140
Wait up, "People of Lips"

5035
04:34:24,190 --> 04:34:25,670
I've just about had it already!

5036
04:34:25,700 --> 04:34:27,260
We got it already!

5037
04:34:27,990 --> 04:34:30,800
We used to be

5038
04:34:29,540 --> 04:34:32,840
the round and large

5039
04:34:31,250 --> 04:34:32,840
light forms

5040
04:34:32,860 --> 04:34:33,840
You've said that

5041
04:34:33,840 --> 04:34:35,460
We got it already

5042
04:34:35,460 --> 04:34:38,280
Why are they saying "People of Lips?"

5043
04:34:38,360 --> 04:34:40,290
And we're not questioning it either

5044
04:34:40,320 --> 04:34:43,800
Like we really are the "People of Lips"

5045
04:34:44,670 --> 04:34:46,130
This way, this way, guys

5046
04:34:47,870 --> 04:34:51,320
"Secret Trap"

5047
04:34:48,150 --> 04:34:50,870
Seriously, give me a break

5048
04:34:49,920 --> 04:34:51,990
I don't know how this walkie-talkie works either

5049
04:34:53,470 --> 04:34:57,830
3m high - Sukekiyo

5050
04:34:57,600 --> 04:34:59,330
That's just freaky

5051
04:35:04,740 --> 04:35:06,220
What the hell was that?!

5052
04:35:06,220 --> 04:35:07,950
That's real freaky

5053
04:35:07,950 --> 04:35:09,240
This isn't good

5054
04:35:09,510 --> 04:35:11,310
My stomach hurts

5055
04:35:19,060 --> 04:35:23,830
Hamada Laugh Track

5056
04:35:20,660 --> 04:35:22,240
I see the bomb

5057
04:35:22,040 --> 04:35:22,850
Where?

5058
04:35:22,900 --> 04:35:24,280
I see it

5059
04:35:29,550 --> 04:35:32,580
That was Hamada-san's high pitched laugh

5060
04:35:32,840 --> 04:35:35,570
I thought Hamada-san just laughed

5061
04:35:35,570 --> 04:35:37,220
No, it was a recording

5062
04:35:38,230 --> 04:35:39,140
Over there, I can see it

5063
04:35:39,770 --> 04:35:42,850
Bomb

5064
04:35:39,820 --> 04:35:41,480
That's what you have to disarm

5065
04:35:41,180 --> 04:35:45,670
Whistles from Wall

5066
04:35:51,910 --> 04:35:54,370
A suspicious person is approaching

5067
04:35:54,370 --> 04:36:01,730
Downtown needs to hide in the closet with the bullet-proof glass

5068
04:36:01,730 --> 04:36:05,110
The rest of you hide underneath the desk!!

5069
04:36:05,140 --> 04:36:07,330
You should be safe there

5070
04:36:07,370 --> 04:36:08,320
Under what?

5071
04:36:08,320 --> 04:36:09,460
I see under the desk!

5072
04:36:09,760 --> 04:36:11,520
We're supposed to hide in here?

5073
04:36:12,330 --> 04:36:18,850
Absolutely Safe Box

5074
04:36:12,540 --> 04:36:13,860
I guess in here

5075
04:36:16,800 --> 04:36:18,330
You gotta be kiddin' me

5076
04:36:18,360 --> 04:36:19,950
What a pain in the ass

5077
04:36:23,160 --> 04:36:25,910
Downtown-san, you're so visible

5078
04:36:25,910 --> 04:36:29,200
That makes all of us

5079
04:36:34,030 --> 04:36:39,050
Suspicious Person - Kai Atou

5080
04:36:39,050 --> 04:36:41,810
What're you gonna do?!! Hey!!

5081
04:36:42,100 --> 04:36:43,810
I'm scared, scared, scared, scared

5082
04:36:44,840 --> 04:36:47,020
What're you gonna do?!

5083
04:36:49,110 --> 04:36:50,740
How scary was that?

5084
04:36:51,200 --> 04:36:53,150
You're no longer in danger

5085
04:36:53,150 --> 04:36:56,250
Proceed to finding the girl!

5086
04:36:56,660 --> 04:36:58,770
Head to the ground level immediately!

5087
04:36:58,770 --> 04:37:02,910
"Secret Trap"

5088
04:37:05,800 --> 04:37:07,230
Bump!

5089
04:37:08,920 --> 04:37:11,640
Bump!

5090
04:37:11,630 --> 04:37:16,290
Sadako Slithers from Under the Desk

5091
04:37:14,210 --> 04:37:16,040
Are we ditching the bomb then?

5092
04:37:16,040 --> 04:37:18,540
We don't need to disarm the bomb or what?

5093
04:37:21,010 --> 04:37:25,860
Tanaka Kicks the Bomb Kit and Injures his Foot

5094
04:37:28,350 --> 04:37:29,680
What happened?

5095
04:37:30,090 --> 04:37:32,680
He ran into...

5096
04:37:35,930 --> 04:37:43,490
Tanaka Rips the Wall

5097
04:37:36,040 --> 04:37:38,070
Tanaka, what's wrong with you?

5098
04:37:40,270 --> 04:37:42,170
Are you OK?

5099
04:37:42,170 --> 04:37:43,970
I'm OK

5100
04:37:43,970 --> 04:37:45,340
What happened to the bomb?

5101
04:37:43,970 --> 04:37:47,270
Off to the Ground Level to Rescue the Girl

5102
04:37:45,340 --> 04:37:46,640
What happened to the bomb?

5103
04:37:46,030 --> 04:37:47,430
I guess we're off the hook

5104
04:37:47,740 --> 04:37:52,800
"Secret Trap"

5105
04:37:47,890 --> 04:37:49,740
Tanaka, I fear for your safety...

5106
04:37:49,460 --> 04:37:51,940
Endo, could you carry this for me?

5107
04:37:52,130 --> 04:37:53,280
I shouldn't have this with me

5108
04:38:00,900 --> 04:38:07,040
Young Allosaurus

5109
04:38:09,690 --> 04:38:11,560
Tanaka~!!

5110
04:38:14,310 --> 04:38:15,350
You're awful

5111
04:38:15,580 --> 04:38:17,840
I had no idea you fell again

5112
04:38:23,250 --> 04:38:24,400
Looks pretty realistic and scary

5113
04:38:27,540 --> 04:38:28,720
I'm scared!

5114
04:38:29,970 --> 04:38:38,270
"Science-Kun"

5115
04:38:38,210 --> 04:38:41,200
Tanaka, he's in your TV show

5116
04:38:44,780 --> 04:38:45,750
Oh, man

5117
04:38:47,350 --> 04:38:49,940
That dinosaur was something else

5118
04:38:49,280 --> 04:38:50,820
Damn, it's him again

5119
04:38:50,490 --> 04:38:55,130
Yutaro

5120
04:38:51,670 --> 04:38:53,020
Hey

5121
04:38:53,770 --> 04:38:55,400
I've been expecting you

5122
04:39:00,660 --> 04:39:02,940
Here's a ticket for you guys

5123
04:39:02,940 --> 04:39:06,360
Come this way, please

5124
04:39:09,500 --> 04:39:10,780
I know that tool box is heavy

5125
04:39:12,280 --> 04:39:13,890
What's this?

5126
04:39:14,810 --> 04:39:15,900
What is this?

5127
04:39:15,900 --> 04:39:19,190
The "Be Scared and Sing Show"

5128
04:39:17,930 --> 04:39:18,840
What's that mean?

5129
04:39:20,720 --> 04:39:21,850
Sit here?

5130
04:39:22,060 --> 04:39:23,590
Not all of us

5131
04:39:23,180 --> 04:39:25,630
I'll just stand here then

5132
04:39:25,630 --> 04:39:26,830
Sorry about that

5133
04:39:25,930 --> 04:39:27,390
Don't worry about it

5134
04:39:29,780 --> 04:39:36,010
The "Be Scared and Sing Show" - Opening

5135
04:39:38,060 --> 04:39:38,580
Oh!

5136
04:39:39,260 --> 04:39:40,600
It's really her!!

5137
04:39:40,810 --> 04:39:43,520
Experience

5138
04:39:43,520 --> 04:39:50,380
Emily Henmi's Mom

5139
04:39:43,520 --> 04:39:50,380
Mari Hanmi

5140
04:39:44,000 --> 04:39:50,640
Stop, if you don't love me

5141
04:39:51,430 --> 04:39:58,170
Stop, don't kiss me

5142
04:39:59,260 --> 04:40:06,870
Stop, and let me go home

5143
04:40:07,470 --> 04:40:09,940
Let me hate you

5144
04:40:11,120 --> 04:40:15,700
Let me just go

5145
04:40:27,600 --> 04:40:30,780
She was the real "Mari"

5146
04:40:31,160 --> 04:40:35,620
She's all, "Stop~"

5147
04:40:35,620 --> 04:40:40,520
Countdown to Bench Collapsing

5148
04:40:35,890 --> 04:40:40,620
Proceed to your left

5149
04:40:38,540 --> 04:40:39,510
Where?

5150
04:40:39,510 --> 04:40:41,480
He said to our left

5151
04:40:41,480 --> 04:40:42,630
Bump

5152
04:40:43,130 --> 04:40:45,010
Bump

5153
04:40:47,450 --> 04:40:49,610
What's this?

5154
04:40:49,040 --> 04:40:50,050
That's not safe

5155
04:40:52,510 --> 04:40:53,870
Man, I hate being outside

5156
04:40:58,430 --> 04:40:59,640
It's freezing

5157
04:41:00,590 --> 04:41:04,980
Mysterious Character Awaits

5158
04:41:01,110 --> 04:41:03,870
The path is in terrible condition

5160
04:41:16,770 --> 04:41:18,130
That isn't the theme song

Avatar~ Here we are~

5162
04:41:26,040 --> 04:41:29,920
Can't wait to tell you~

5164
04:41:34,670 --> 04:41:35,960
Feeling like a Virgin Bata

5165
04:41:35,960 --> 04:41:37,820
Feeling like a Virgin Bata

5166
04:41:36,800 --> 04:41:38,120
What's Bata?

5167
04:41:36,800 --> 04:41:38,120
What's Bata?

5168
04:41:43,220 --> 04:41:45,260
OK, back to the verse

5169
04:41:45,260 --> 04:41:48,880
James Cameron

5170
04:41:48,880 --> 04:41:52,040
He's the director

5171
04:41:52,040 --> 04:41:59,090
Easily confused with Cameron Diaz

5172
04:41:57,090 --> 04:42:02,050
"Secret" Trap

5173
04:42:08,860 --> 04:42:09,960
What is this all about?

5174
04:42:11,650 --> 04:42:12,200
Seriously...

5175
04:42:14,470 --> 04:42:15,990
Who shot you anyway?

5176
04:42:15,990 --> 04:42:17,700
This is messed up

5177
04:42:18,100 --> 04:42:20,810
Tell me who shot him

5178
04:42:20,850 --> 04:42:22,120
I see a note over there

5179
04:42:22,120 --> 04:42:27,230
"One Member Must Enter the Phone Booth to Receive the Next Command"

5180
04:42:27,250 --> 04:42:29,660
Yama-chan, you go

5181
04:42:28,920 --> 04:42:29,720
If you would please!

5182
04:42:29,720 --> 04:42:31,810
Why is Yama-chan going in?

5183
04:42:31,860 --> 04:42:33,600
Well, because you're our "Image Character"

5184
04:42:33,600 --> 04:42:36,010
Well, because you're our "Image Character"

5185
04:42:36,370 --> 04:42:38,940
What do you mean by "Image Character?"

5186
04:42:39,420 --> 04:42:41,030
Do I have to close this?

5187
04:42:41,030 --> 04:42:42,110
Just leave it open

5188
04:42:42,110 --> 04:42:42,890
Is that OK?

5189
04:42:43,250 --> 04:42:45,030
He just has to wait for the call, right?

5190
04:42:45,030 --> 04:42:46,350
Right

5191
04:42:46,350 --> 04:42:50,660
"Secret Trap"

5192
04:42:57,800 --> 04:43:03,550
Pitfall

5193
04:43:00,710 --> 04:43:03,210
This scared us

5194
04:43:06,610 --> 04:43:08,460
Thank God...

5195
04:43:10,390 --> 04:43:12,290
You OK?

5196
04:43:12,570 --> 04:43:15,490
That scared me

5197
04:43:16,670 --> 04:43:19,220
I just saw your face right here

5198
04:43:19,220 --> 04:43:21,040
That was scary

5199
04:43:21,040 --> 04:43:22,840
A spectacular fall

5200
04:43:22,840 --> 04:43:25,170
I had to do a double-take

5201
04:43:26,220 --> 04:43:28,060
How scary

5202
04:43:28,090 --> 04:43:29,920
That's not safe

5203
04:43:30,050 --> 04:43:31,520
This isn't very safe

5204
04:43:31,520 --> 04:43:35,320
So no need to wait for directions?

5205
04:43:33,430 --> 04:43:35,050
There's no need to wait

5206
04:43:35,540 --> 04:43:37,070
Which way should we go?

5207
04:43:37,080 --> 04:43:38,870
I see an arrow pointing that way

5208
04:43:39,080 --> 04:43:42,130
Yama-chan, that was scary

5209
04:43:42,130 --> 04:43:43,960
I caught a glimpse of you

5210
04:43:43,960 --> 04:43:46,120
before you disappeared into the pit

5211
04:43:46,810 --> 04:43:50,850
Please stay inside the perimeter where the footing is better

5212
04:43:47,020 --> 04:43:51,620
"Secret Trap"

5213
04:43:51,900 --> 04:43:54,610
What's that coming at us!?

5214
04:43:55,950 --> 04:43:58,460
Here comes the "Star"

5215
04:43:58,460 --> 04:44:07,030
Wheel Gymnastic Pro: Akira Nishikino

5216
04:44:02,840 --> 04:44:04,390
That is amazing

5217
04:44:12,740 --> 04:44:15,020
Are you OK, Star?

5218
04:44:16,480 --> 04:44:19,540
I heard his knees scrape on the ground

5219
04:44:19,970 --> 04:44:21,220
Watch, watch out!

5220
04:44:24,410 --> 04:44:25,860
Be careful, please

5221
04:44:25,390 --> 04:44:26,820
Star, you need to be more careful

5222
04:44:27,750 --> 04:44:31,040
I think the Star is hurt

5223
04:44:31,330 --> 04:44:34,180
We're at the ground level

5224
04:44:35,850 --> 04:44:41,920
Man, what is this?!

5225
04:44:41,460 --> 04:44:43,160
Where's his daughter?

5226
04:44:42,280 --> 04:44:47,270
Ground Level Cemetery

5227
04:44:44,240 --> 04:44:45,590
She's somewhere in here?

5228
04:44:45,640 --> 04:44:46,660
C'mon, man...

5229
04:44:48,120 --> 04:44:48,910
You know what?

5230
04:44:48,970 --> 04:44:50,440
I can't run in this condition

5231
04:44:51,700 --> 04:44:55,140
Are we supposed to walk on this plastic wrap thingy?

5232
04:44:55,140 --> 04:44:56,850
We're going to slip all over the place

5233
04:44:56,950 --> 04:45:00,760
Look at the suspicious looking piles of sand...

5234
04:45:01,580 --> 04:45:03,990
Tanaka, you OK?

5235
04:45:04,900 --> 04:45:06,200
Do you wanna be in the front, Tanaka?

5236
04:45:06,200 --> 04:45:07,960
I don't think so

5237
04:45:07,960 --> 04:45:10,190
Nowhere's safe

5238
04:45:10,190 --> 04:45:13,960
There's another note up there

5239
04:45:13,990 --> 04:45:19,880
"Rescue the Girl with this Stroller"

5240
04:45:19,880 --> 04:45:24,550
The Girl is in the Building

5241
04:45:19,890 --> 04:45:20,730
So she's in here!

5242
04:45:20,730 --> 04:45:22,470
What? Serious?

5243
04:45:22,470 --> 04:45:24,470
I would say this is...

5244
04:45:24,800 --> 04:45:26,780
I'd say this is Tanaka's mission

5245
04:45:25,830 --> 04:45:27,870
I agree

5246
04:45:27,870 --> 04:45:29,260
I'm going?

5247
04:45:31,130 --> 04:45:32,390
So put her in the stroller?

5248
04:45:32,390 --> 04:45:34,110
She must be really little

5249
04:45:34,110 --> 04:45:36,230
One girl?

5250
04:45:34,710 --> 04:45:35,740
No idea

5251
04:45:36,230 --> 04:45:37,710
I'd say just one girl

5252
04:45:37,940 --> 04:45:40,920
A step

5253
04:45:39,420 --> 04:45:41,400
Don't worry, we won't leave you

5254
04:45:43,530 --> 04:45:47,580
How could you miss that little step?

5255
04:45:46,240 --> 04:45:47,520
Please don't leave me here, OK?

5256
04:45:51,480 --> 04:45:54,830
Kidnapped Daughter

5257
04:45:54,160 --> 04:45:56,090
So she needs to be in the stroller...

5258
04:45:56,710 --> 04:45:59,920
We all need to go in there then

5259
04:45:59,620 --> 04:46:01,030
I'm leaving the tool kit here then

5260
04:46:02,650 --> 04:46:05,080
Well, well, well, well... "Daughter?"

5261
04:46:05,080 --> 04:46:08,500
I'd say she's beyond the "girl" stage...

5262
04:46:08,600 --> 04:46:14,770
With the Girl in the Stroller, they Attempt to Escape

5263
04:46:09,770 --> 04:46:12,990
With Director's daughter securely inside the stroller,

5264
04:46:13,010 --> 04:46:14,930
they attempt an escape...

5265
04:46:18,340 --> 04:46:19,700
She's awake and alert

5266
04:46:20,350 --> 04:46:21,600
She's up

5267
04:46:26,200 --> 04:46:28,050
She couldn't be more conscious

5268
04:46:28,050 --> 04:46:32,780
"Secret Trap"

5269
04:46:28,100 --> 04:46:29,800
Her eyes are wide open

5270
04:46:30,580 --> 04:46:33,310
If you're up, why not walk on your own?

5271
04:46:33,310 --> 04:46:35,030
We should be good now

5272
04:46:35,030 --> 04:46:37,230
The mission is pretty much accomplished...

5273
04:46:57,660 --> 04:47:01,280
A Combination of Zombies and Explosions!

5274
04:47:08,790 --> 04:47:10,220
Not good

5275
04:47:17,100 --> 04:47:18,540
You fell again, Tanaka

5276
04:47:19,860 --> 04:47:20,940
This isn't cool

5277
04:47:21,840 --> 04:47:24,900
Matsumoto's left by himself!

5278
04:47:24,900 --> 04:47:26,860
That was totally uncalled for!

5279
04:47:26,860 --> 04:47:29,170
Wait up~!

5280
04:47:35,090 --> 04:47:38,030
WAIT THE HELL UP~!!

5281
04:47:38,460 --> 04:47:40,890
He's left on his own!

5282
04:47:41,280 --> 04:47:41,980
Not good

5283
04:47:42,030 --> 04:47:42,990
Not good

5284
04:47:43,160 --> 04:47:44,520
This isn't cool!

5285
04:47:44,780 --> 04:47:45,540
Wait guys

5286
04:47:45,540 --> 04:47:47,850
Tanaka, help him out with the stroller

5287
04:47:48,020 --> 04:47:50,850
That was seriously messed up

5288
04:47:50,930 --> 04:47:54,930
I was the only one pushing the stroller

5289
04:48:00,770 --> 04:48:04,190
The five members endured cruel and rigorous training

5290
04:48:04,900 --> 04:48:07,860
all day and all night to become spies

5291
04:48:11,280 --> 04:48:16,620
The end has finally arrived

5292
04:48:21,360 --> 04:48:22,570
OK, guys

5293
04:48:22,720 --> 04:48:25,370
Your day as spy trainees is officially over

5294
04:48:26,210 --> 04:48:28,710
You have all done well

5295
04:48:28,710 --> 04:48:30,050
Finally...

5296
04:48:30,650 --> 04:48:35,200
How was it, Hamada?

5297
04:48:35,200 --> 04:48:39,320
We made it without losing anybody

5298
04:48:39,320 --> 04:48:41,720
Matsumoto?

5299
04:48:42,250 --> 04:48:45,680
I'm the one who rescued that old hag

5300
04:48:48,960 --> 04:48:54,010
Don't forget the no laughing rule until you cross the front gate

5301
04:48:54,010 --> 04:48:57,210
It's not over yet

5302
04:48:59,120 --> 04:49:00,400
At last...

5303
04:49:04,030 --> 04:49:06,340
My butt has had it

5304
04:49:08,370 --> 04:49:09,530
My butt hurts...

5305
04:49:09,530 --> 04:49:10,790
Yours too?

5306
04:49:10,790 --> 04:49:14,010
No matter how many times we do this, my butt still hurts

5307
04:49:14,060 --> 04:49:16,720
I suppose there's no way to train for this

5308
04:49:32,790 --> 04:49:36,450
I'm the parent of an egg

5309
04:49:36,770 --> 04:49:40,670
I'm the parent of an egg

5310
04:49:40,670 --> 04:49:42,920
My name is Piiyoko-chan

5311
04:49:42,920 --> 04:49:45,340
Pi, Pi, Piiyoko-chan

5312
04:49:45,390 --> 04:49:47,310
I am a duck, quack, quack, quack

5313
04:49:47,250 --> 04:49:51,030
Grandson of the Falcon

04:49:51,770 --> 04:49:52,810
I am Piiyoko-chan

5316
04:49:59,130 --> 04:50:01,540
I get it, the egg hatched

5317
04:50:03,280 --> 04:50:05,060
This is the first slap of the new year

5318
04:50:08,280 --> 04:50:11,030
Congrats on your graduation

5319
04:50:11,030 --> 04:50:13,330
Naoki Tanaka, Congrats

5320
04:50:13,330 --> 04:50:15,420
Hosei Yamasaki, Congrats

5321
04:50:15,420 --> 04:50:17,190
Matsumoto Hi Shoshi Shan...

5322
04:50:17,190 --> 04:50:18,870
Congratulations

5323
04:50:18,870 --> 04:50:21,080
Hamada Masa Hi..Hyoshi-san

5324
04:50:21,080 --> 04:50:22,370

Shozo Endou, Congrats

5326
04:50:24,630 --> 04:50:27,930
Why can't he say our names right?

5327
04:50:27,930 --> 04:50:32,920
Please join me in praying for our good health this coming year

5328
04:50:32,920 --> 04:50:34,560
Follow my lead, please

5329
04:50:35,110 --> 04:50:36,540
Yo~~

5330
04:50:38,600 --> 04:50:40,300
I am Piiyoko-chan

5331
04:50:59,110 --> 04:51:01,340
It hurts way more being outside

5332
04:51:03,240 --> 04:51:04,570
Shall we go?

5333
04:51:08,370 --> 04:51:14,950
Butt-Slap Counter

5334
04:51:08,370 --> 04:51:14,950

5339
04:51:14,950 --> 04:51:18,440
Once again, we're competing against the "End-of-the Year Singing Contest"

5340
04:51:15,100 --> 04:51:29,840
"That's What's Important"

5341
04:51:15,100 --> 04:51:29,840

Toshiyuki Tachikawa

5343
04:51:18,440 --> 04:51:22,500
This year the spy trainees must not laugh

5344
04:51:22,500 --> 04:51:26,580
If you don't mind complaints from viewers

5345
04:51:26,580 --> 04:51:30,500
go ahead and show his junk

5346
04:51:30,970 --> 04:51:33,830
"This is how you like it?" - Muga Tsukaji

5347
04:51:33,850 --> 04:51:38,370
dances so his (or her?) brother can go to school

5348
04:51:38,950 --> 04:51:42,410
All it takes is Matsuko showing up

5349
04:51:42,410 --> 04:51:46,380
to terrify Endou

5350
04:51:46,700 --> 04:51:50,360
After numerous yelling exchanges

5351
04:51:50,360 --> 04:51:54,460
Nishiki and Katase never let up

5352
04:51:54,460 --> 04:51:58,340
Despite Happy Boy's upbeat shouting

5353
04:51:58,340 --> 04:52:01,920
"Wow!" never quite caught on

5354
04:52:01,920 --> 04:52:10,110
It's not that I'm sad that Chiaki isn't here

5355
04:52:10,110 --> 04:52:20,570
it's that now everyone knows my dating habit

5356
04:52:23,030 --> 04:52:24,640
It's sad when

5357
04:52:24,640 --> 04:52:30,460
Masatoshi, out of character, punches Yamasaki in the stomach

5358
04:52:30,460 --> 04:52:34,030
Instead of just angrily storming off,

5359
04:52:34,030 --> 04:52:38,380
he squeezed in a kick to Sakai

5360
04:52:46,810 --> 04:52:50,280
His suit got yanked off by a nice limo

5361
04:52:50,280 --> 04:52:54,610
And Itao kept howling, never letting go of his Bond character

5362
04:52:55,080 --> 04:52:58,170
Tanaka got caught by a fishing hook

5363
04:52:58,170 --> 04:53:02,210
while Sawamura regretted accepting this high-paying gig

5364
04:53:03,050 --> 04:53:06,380
Bibari is now in charge of the play

5365
04:53:06,380 --> 04:53:10,330
Claudia's acting is still horrible

5366
04:53:10,330 --> 04:53:14,240
Among the "has-been" actors,

5367
04:53:14,360 --> 04:53:17,760
Nakamura somehow fits in nicely

5368
04:53:17,860 --> 04:53:26,200
Nothing particularly terrifying came out of Hamada's desk

5369
04:53:26,200 --> 04:53:36,790
But it was irritating how Little Hamada looked so much like him

5370
04:53:38,900 --> 04:53:42,620
The Hand-Towel gang never gives up

5371
04:53:42,620 --> 04:53:46,290
they put their bodies on the line without running away

5372
04:53:46,290 --> 04:53:50,300
Koba almost loses it all

5373
04:53:50,300 --> 04:53:54,280
While Ryu-chan struggles

5374
04:53:54,890 --> 04:53:58,500
Bathing with girls you can't have

5375
04:53:58,500 --> 04:54:02,370
A girl makes a proposition and starts dancing

5376
04:54:02,370 --> 04:54:10,280
Every shot is a good shot for Chono, and that's important

5377
04:54:11,100 --> 04:54:14,510
One impersonator, almost too good

5378
04:54:14,510 --> 04:54:18,390
A lesser known impersonator, just winging it

5379
04:54:18,390 --> 04:54:22,300
Shibata with no make-up, smokes a cigarette

5380
04:54:22,300 --> 04:54:26,830
Taro Kida takes care of business in the restroom

5381
04:54:26,830 --> 04:54:30,690
Here comes Seiji who annoys the cast

5382
04:54:30,690 --> 04:54:34,290
And their tired bodies can't take any more of Murakami

5383
04:54:34,290 --> 04:54:38,170
Mari sings an awkwardly dirty song

5384
04:54:38,170 --> 04:54:42,140
Nishikino fails on his wheel

5385
04:54:43,020 --> 04:54:46,430
Once again, the show welcomes the new year

5386
04:54:46,430 --> 04:54:50,360
while we all laugh and get slapped

5387
04:54:50,360 --> 04:54:57,860
Nobody's getting younger, so staying healthy is the most important thing

5388
04:55:02,640 --> 04:55:09,260
Here's to an abundance of laughs this year

5389
04:55:02,640 --> 04:55:09,280
Happy New Year

5390
04:55:05,480 --> 04:55:08,420
It is finally over!

5391
04:55:09,750 --> 04:55:11,570
You guys better listen

5392
04:55:11,570 --> 04:55:12,620
What's going on?

5393
04:55:12,620 --> 04:55:15,240
Why was I the only one helping that old hag?

5394
04:55:15,240 --> 04:55:18,860
I'd say 99% of the zombies touched my shoulder

5395
04:55:21,430 --> 04:55:24,920
(Inaudible)

5396
04:55:26,620 --> 04:55:28,690
Seriously, give me a break

5397
04:55:29,920 --> 04:55:34,790
I'd say the funniest was when you fell down on stage

5398
04:55:34,830 --> 04:55:36,600
I was losing my footing...

5399
04:55:38,240 --> 04:55:39,730
I was losing it...

5400
04:55:39,440 --> 04:55:42,400
When Chono shoved you and you just fell on your butt,

5401
04:55:42,400 --> 04:55:44,020
I lost it

5402
04:55:44,630 --> 04:55:47,450
I thought, "That must be what's it like being a rag doll"

5403
04:55:47,840 --> 04:55:49,700
Did I look the part?

5404
04:55:49,530 --> 04:55:51,360
Are we on for next year, too?

5405
04:55:51,360 --> 04:55:53,620
But you gotta figure...

5406
04:55:53,620 --> 04:55:55,450
Arashi SHOULD be doing this,

5407
04:55:55,440 --> 04:55:59,620
ARASHI is a popular boy band

5408
04:55:55,450 --> 04:55:58,150
but they'll be singing on the other channel...

5409
04:55:58,310 --> 04:56:00,140
Why don't we enter the "Singing Contest" then?

5410
04:56:00,140 --> 04:56:01,560
Right, if we make it,

5411
04:56:01,560 --> 04:56:03,830
the cast from "Shouten" can take over for us

5412
04:56:05,320 --> 04:56:06,030
Do you think they can do this...?

5413
04:56:06,030 --> 04:56:07,910
They're all pretty old...

5414
04:56:08,200 --> 04:56:10,020
Not pretty old, really old

5415
04:56:10,020 --> 04:56:18,420
Thank you for your continuous support of Gaki No Tsukai
