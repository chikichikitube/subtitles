We know it!

66
00:01:45,980 --> 00:01:47,770
This is something we see every year

67
00:01:47,780 --> 00:01:48,170
Yep!

68
00:01:48,010 --> 00:01:49,970
You guys are only like this at the start!

69
00:01:50,880 --> 00:01:52,350
It's the truth

70
00:01:52,080 --> 00:01:53,220

This year's theme is Treasure Hunter

Treasure Hunter

74
00:01:58,540 --> 00:02:01,010
When you hear Treasure Hunter, a question mark appears...

75
00:02:01,010 --> 00:02:03,480
When you hear Treasure Hunter, a question mark appears...

76
00:02:03,480 --> 00:02:04,850
Trust me, after watching the show

77
00:02:04,850 --> 00:02:05,680
That question mark will remain in place

78
00:02:05,680 --> 00:02:09,480
That question mark will remain in place

79
00:02:07,350 --> 00:02:08,300
Even after watching?

80
00:02:08,790 --> 00:02:09,620
After all that?!

81
00:02:09,480 --> 00:02:11,790
It'll stay

82
00:02:10,310 --> 00:02:11,530
Every year...

83
00:02:11,580 --> 00:02:12,690
Well what can you do

84
00:02:12,550 --> 00:02:13,550
Alright, let's start Matsumoto, engage VTR

85
00:02:13,550 --> 00:02:14,390
Alright, let's start Matsumoto, engage VTR

86
00:02:14,390 --> 00:02:16,660
Alright, let's start Matsumoto, engage VTR

87
00:02:16,850 --> 00:02:18,110

88
00:02:18,110 --> 00:02:23,540
Please watch the videoooooooooooooooooooo~

89
00:02:27,130 --> 00:02:30,710
Enough already!!

90
00:02:30,750 --> 00:02:35,380
No Laughing Treasure Hunter

91
00:02:31,560 --> 00:02:32,290
There it is...

92
00:02:34,830 --> 00:02:36,260
Started pretty early

93
00:02:35,990 --> 00:02:42,180
The first morning

94
00:02:37,000 --> 00:02:38,410
The first morning

95
00:02:39,840 --> 00:02:41,950
The invigorating light of the sun

96
00:02:42,380 --> 00:02:45,720
The members' battle

97
00:02:42,780 --> 00:02:45,110
greets our members before their battle

98
00:02:45,990 --> 00:02:48,290
This year I, uh, I'm gonna go home in the middle of the day

99
00:02:48,290 --> 00:02:51,230
This year I, uh, I'm gonna go home in the middle of the day

100
00:02:50,020 --> 00:02:51,200
That's sneaky

101
00:02:51,240 --> 00:02:52,540
Yeah, the staff told me

102
00:02:52,630 --> 00:02:57,130
"Matsumoto, if you want to go home, uh, go for it..."

103
00:02:56,240 --> 00:02:58,570
No way...

104
00:02:57,880 --> 00:02:59,080
Everyone wants that

105
00:03:00,930 --> 00:03:01,740
Among the staff pretty much everyone agreed

106
00:03:01,740 --> 00:03:03,890
Among the staff pretty much everyone agreed

107
00:03:04,340 --> 00:03:05,540
"If you're feeling tired, just go home"

108
00:03:05,540 --> 00:03:07,380
"If you're feeling tired, just go home"

109
00:03:07,010 --> 00:03:08,290
Oh, the sun came out

110
00:03:08,740 --> 00:03:10,240
Oh yeah, feels nice

111
00:03:10,360 --> 00:03:11,430
"Wait here!"

112
00:03:11,700 --> 00:03:14,640
Looks like they made it heavier so we can't knock it over

113
00:03:11,700 --> 00:03:17,590
T/N: Matsumoto kicked it and knocked it over in the previous year.

114
00:03:15,020 --> 00:03:17,590
Who would knock it over?!

115
00:03:17,810 --> 00:03:17,980
Oi!!

116
00:03:17,980 --> 00:03:21,090
Oi!!

117
00:03:19,890 --> 00:03:21,640
I didn't notice him at all

118
00:03:21,600 --> 00:03:22,520
There he is

119
00:03:22,360 --> 00:03:23,690
Coming from pretty far away

120
00:03:24,020 --> 00:03:25,590
He's riding something...?

121
00:03:25,610 --> 00:03:27,460
Giddy-up!

122
00:03:26,380 --> 00:03:27,460
Giddy-up!

123
00:03:31,060 --> 00:03:35,640
Fujiwara Hiroshi

124
00:03:31,070 --> 00:03:35,640
Downtown's old manager

125
00:03:33,400 --> 00:03:34,540
Can you tell what he is?

126
00:03:35,330 --> 00:03:36,350
He's doing it this year too

127
00:03:36,300 --> 00:03:38,510
A horse?

128
00:03:37,740 --> 00:03:39,970
Makes sense he'd yell "giddy-up" then

129
00:03:40,570 --> 00:03:41,580
Heeey!!

130
00:03:41,580 --> 00:03:42,580
Heeey!!

131
00:03:42,040 --> 00:03:43,640
He's got a great face this year too

132
00:03:42,910 --> 00:03:44,250
Whoaa~!!

133
00:03:43,640 --> 00:03:45,900
The horse's legs are stiff

134
00:03:44,490 --> 00:03:46,290
Giddy-up!

135
00:03:46,510 --> 00:03:47,890
The legs are rigid

136
00:03:50,330 --> 00:03:52,270
His front...

137
00:03:54,220 --> 00:03:55,320
His legs and tail are completely stiff!!

138
00:03:55,320 --> 00:03:57,230
His legs and tail are completely stiff!!

139
00:03:57,240 --> 00:03:57,860
Rigid and stiff!

140
00:03:57,760 --> 00:03:59,030
That's right

141
00:03:57,860 --> 00:04:00,530
Rigid and stiff!

142
00:03:59,460 --> 00:04:00,340
You hear?

143
00:04:00,990 --> 00:04:02,160
He's frozen

144
00:04:04,170 --> 00:04:06,530
What's with that outfit?

145
00:04:08,670 --> 00:04:10,970
I'm great at riding horses, man

146
00:04:11,440 --> 00:04:13,510
He's just praising himself?

147
00:04:13,880 --> 00:04:16,310
The only people who can ride horses with such talent in show biz are

148
00:04:16,310 --> 00:04:18,150
The only people who can ride horses with such talent in show biz are

149
00:04:18,150 --> 00:04:18,910
Either me or Matsudaira Ken, you gnow... Know

150
00:04:18,150 --> 00:04:21,480
T/N: Matsudaira Ken is a famous actor who is well known for his roles in Japanese historical dramas. He has several scenes where he plays a lord on horseback.

151
00:04:18,910 --> 00:04:19,750
Either me or Matsudaira Ken, you gnow... Know

152
00:04:19,750 --> 00:04:20,450
Either me or Matsudaira Ken, you gnow... Know

153
00:04:20,450 --> 00:04:21,480
Either me or Matsudaira Ken, you gnow... Know

154
00:04:21,760 --> 00:04:23,190
His previous line was weird

155
00:04:22,280 --> 00:04:23,050
Not only did you mispronounce, but also your name is "Hiroshi" so that makes it confusing

156
00:04:22,280 --> 00:04:26,350
T/N: Fujiwara's line for "in show biz" included "Hiroshi" which is also a homonym for his first name. So Matsumoto hints that it sounded like "The only Hiroshis in show biz could do such horseriding are..." There was no way to make that joke make sense in English.

157
00:04:23,050 --> 00:04:24,220
Not only did you mispronounce, but also your name is "Hiroshi" so that makes it confusing

158
00:04:24,220 --> 00:04:26,350
Not only did you mispronounce, but also your name is "Hiroshi" so that makes it confusing

159
00:04:26,690 --> 00:04:28,790
So, about this year's theme...

160
00:04:28,790 --> 00:04:30,720
I ask Hosei for his guess every year,

161
00:04:31,130 --> 00:04:34,160
Because his jokes never work out

162
00:04:34,160 --> 00:04:36,600
I'm gonna select our three helpers, Hosei, Endo and Tanaka

163
00:04:36,600 --> 00:04:37,770
I'm gonna select our three helpers, Hosei, Endo and Tanaka

164
00:04:37,770 --> 00:04:38,600
I'm gonna select our three helpers, Hosei, Endo and Tanaka

165
00:04:38,600 --> 00:04:40,100
I'm gonna select our three helpers, Hosei, Endo and Tanaka

166
00:04:40,110 --> 00:04:41,540
By working together, make a guess for this theme with an airhead joke and present it

167
00:04:41,540 --> 00:04:43,200
By working together, make a guess for this theme with an airhead joke and present it

168
00:04:43,200 --> 00:04:44,310
By working together, make a guess for this theme with an airhead joke and present it

169
00:04:45,040 --> 00:04:46,840
An airhead joke about the theme?

170
00:04:45,370 --> 00:04:46,800
Theme?

171
00:04:46,580 --> 00:04:47,780
An airhead joke about the theme...

172
00:04:48,140 --> 00:04:50,810
Should be obvious just by looking

173
00:04:49,690 --> 00:04:51,980
It's surprisingly hard to tell

174
00:04:52,110 --> 00:04:54,240
He came in on a horse

175
00:04:54,360 --> 00:04:55,490
Working together...

176
00:04:56,000 --> 00:04:57,330
He has a horse...

177
00:04:57,420 --> 00:04:59,120
How about a nurse?

178
00:04:58,270 --> 00:05:00,010
Might be good

179
00:04:59,120 --> 00:05:00,990
I think it'll work

180
00:05:01,000 --> 00:05:01,360
Eh?

181
00:05:01,290 --> 00:05:03,290
A pilot might be good too...

182
00:05:03,290 --> 00:05:05,960
Nah, nurse is better than pilot

183
00:05:04,160 --> 00:05:05,280
Go with nurse then

184
00:05:06,190 --> 00:05:08,230
You're taking too long!

185
00:05:08,290 --> 00:05:10,200
Say it together on my mark

186
00:05:10,300 --> 00:05:10,920
Alright

187
00:05:10,680 --> 00:05:11,640
Here we go

188
00:05:12,100 --> 00:05:13,330
Ready, go!!

189
00:05:13,380 --> 00:05:15,500
Nurse!

190
00:05:13,380 --> 00:05:15,500
Nurse!

191
00:05:13,380 --> 00:05:15,500
Nurse!

192
00:05:15,520 --> 00:05:16,770
Hey!!

193
00:05:16,770 --> 00:05:18,210
If you 3 thought about it together, it should've been 3 times as funny

194
00:05:18,210 --> 00:05:20,010
If you 3 thought about it together, it should've been 3 times as funny

195
00:05:20,010 --> 00:05:22,640
Instead you're one third as funny!

196
00:05:22,640 --> 00:05:24,650
I wanted to say that

197
00:05:23,900 --> 00:05:25,350
The theme is already determined anyway

198
00:05:25,520 --> 00:05:26,890
Even if you say that...

199
00:05:26,910 --> 00:05:30,320
But yeah, nurse was really damn unfunny

200
00:05:30,100 --> 00:05:31,360
You should've told us when we were discussing

201
00:05:31,490 --> 00:05:32,670
You were there, listening!

202
00:05:33,450 --> 00:05:35,790
Dental hygenist would have worked

203
00:05:36,260 --> 00:05:39,360
He's laughing

204
00:05:38,420 --> 00:05:40,470
He's laughing, so nonchalantly

205
00:05:40,980 --> 00:05:42,500
See, he's laughing

206
00:05:42,740 --> 00:05:44,760
They were really similar, so

207
00:05:46,070 --> 00:05:47,440
Okay whatever

208
00:05:47,440 --> 00:05:48,870
This year's theme is Treasure Hunter

209
00:05:48,870 --> 00:05:50,200
This year's theme is Treasure Hunter

210
00:05:50,200 --> 00:05:53,410
Can there be a specialty like that?

211
00:05:54,410 --> 00:05:57,780
...'sfine

212
00:05:55,720 --> 00:05:56,650
" 'sfine" ?

213
00:06:00,050 --> 00:06:01,950
He's using Kansai dialect

214
00:06:01,950 --> 00:06:04,720
I was just asking if we're really covering such a worldwide topic for this

215
00:06:04,720 --> 00:06:12,860
Our beginner Treasure Hunters start

216
00:06:04,720 --> 00:06:12,860
their grueling occupation!

217
00:06:05,680 --> 00:06:06,870
And now

218
00:06:06,870 --> 00:06:09,450
After becoming Treasure Hunters

219
00:06:07,860 --> 00:06:10,160
Every time, look at Hosei

220
00:06:09,450 --> 00:06:12,550
They embark on their 24 hour challenge

221
00:06:10,910 --> 00:06:12,900
Don't you have a better picture?!

222
00:06:13,690 --> 00:06:14,900
I said Treasure Hunter, but what's with those outfits?

223
00:06:14,900 --> 00:06:17,270
I said Treasure Hunter, but what's with those outfits?

224
00:06:16,340 --> 00:06:19,890
We've prepared some boxes for you to change in, let's go

225
00:06:19,930 --> 00:06:25,340
they must dress appropriately

226
00:06:19,980 --> 00:06:25,340
In order to become Treasure Hunters

227
00:06:20,490 --> 00:06:22,810
First step to becoming a treasure hunter

228
00:06:22,810 --> 00:06:24,870
is to change into fitting clothes

229
00:06:25,340 --> 00:06:27,810
Hosei is always last, isn't he?

230
00:06:27,790 --> 00:06:28,670
Until recently

231
00:06:28,580 --> 00:06:30,950
It's been you for five years though

232
00:06:31,390 --> 00:06:32,520
Everyone ready?

233
00:06:32,480 --> 00:06:33,000
Yep

234
00:06:33,240 --> 00:06:34,180
Alright

235
00:06:34,180 --> 00:06:35,180
Open!!

236
00:06:35,180 --> 00:06:36,520
*cough*

237
00:06:38,300 --> 00:06:40,190
Why the cough

238
00:06:39,690 --> 00:06:42,620
Y'all look a lot better in uniform

239
00:06:41,730 --> 00:06:42,960
He's got a cold?

240
00:06:43,060 --> 00:06:46,530
Hamada's the only one with a wig

241
00:06:46,150 --> 00:06:47,140
We look good?

242
00:06:47,560 --> 00:06:49,560
Last year we got in a heap of trouble over Hamada

243
00:06:49,560 --> 00:06:53,030
So this year we kept your outfit normal

244
00:06:51,320 --> 00:06:52,720
There's nothing normal about this!

245
00:06:52,200 --> 00:06:53,070
I see

246
00:06:52,980 --> 00:06:53,940
He's the only one too

247
00:06:53,970 --> 00:06:56,400
I'm not normal looking at all!

248
00:06:56,120 --> 00:06:57,170
Seriously, this guy

249
00:06:57,170 --> 00:07:00,170
Is that your own wig?

250
00:06:58,240 --> 00:06:59,620
What the hell

251
00:07:00,170 --> 00:07:03,040
It fits a bit too well

252
00:07:00,630 --> 00:07:03,000
How about we swap?

253
00:07:03,030 --> 00:07:05,160
I'm always the one wearing this, so you guys do the blackface

254
00:07:06,410 --> 00:07:07,120
I really don't like last year's look though

255
00:07:07,120 --> 00:07:10,420
I really don't like last year's look though

256
00:07:07,960 --> 00:07:09,350
It's no good

257
00:07:09,810 --> 00:07:11,110
We had that incident last year

258
00:07:10,650 --> 00:07:11,800
As if we could do it again

259
00:07:10,750 --> 00:07:12,310
How long are you going to complain?

260
00:07:13,620 --> 00:07:14,720
We get hit and then after it's over, we still get hit

261
00:07:14,720 --> 00:07:17,230
We get hit and then after it's over, we still get hit

262
00:07:17,230 --> 00:07:28,400
Rules of the game

263
00:07:18,230 --> 00:07:20,200
The rules are simple

264
00:07:18,360 --> 00:07:28,400
Be Treasure Hunters and work hard

265
00:07:18,590 --> 00:07:28,400
During your duties, you must not laugh

266
00:07:18,860 --> 00:07:28,400
Upon laughing, receive a punishment

267
00:07:20,500 --> 00:07:26,000
No matter what happens while on duty, you absolutely may not laugh

268
00:07:26,280 --> 00:07:28,280
That is all

269
00:07:28,700 --> 00:07:31,710
Alright, the bus is going to come here, so just wait

270
00:07:31,710 --> 00:07:33,470
Heipo themed?

271
00:07:36,310 --> 00:07:39,010
It fits the theme, but looks kinda plain

272
00:07:39,580 --> 00:07:41,820
Looks camouflaged

273
00:07:42,170 --> 00:07:44,670
Omame Archaeological Research Institute

274
00:07:46,890 --> 00:07:48,560
Here's what we got this year

275
00:07:48,570 --> 00:07:50,950
Heipo Foundation

276
00:07:50,950 --> 00:07:52,910
Archaeological Institute of Omame

277
00:07:53,060 --> 00:07:56,260
That's where you'll be working

278
00:07:53,060 --> 00:08:00,200
T/N: "Omame" means bean, which is Heipo's nickname because of how short he is.

279
00:07:56,280 --> 00:07:57,450
No, it's weird

280
00:07:57,530 --> 00:08:00,200
The name sounds like we'll be researching beans

281
00:08:00,200 --> 00:08:01,870
It's "archaeology" but we're researching beans?

282
00:08:01,870 --> 00:08:03,340
It's "archaeology" but we're researching beans?

283
00:08:04,720 --> 00:08:09,710
This is the commuter bus for the foundation

284
00:08:11,000 --> 00:08:15,360
The bus was first thought up by the founder, Heipo

285
00:08:15,730 --> 00:08:20,650
And now, they head towards the institute

286
00:08:21,120 --> 00:08:23,090
When you step on this bus, the game will start

287
00:08:23,090 --> 00:08:25,060
When you step on this bus, the game will start

288
00:08:24,330 --> 00:08:25,290
Here we go

289
00:08:25,430 --> 00:08:26,730
Let's go

290
00:08:28,030 --> 00:08:31,330
I'm already sick of it

291
00:08:32,450 --> 00:08:33,810
We'll be going back and forth here too

292
00:08:34,580 --> 00:08:37,250
Being the first to get on sucks

293
00:08:35,790 --> 00:08:38,450
That's right

294
00:08:35,970 --> 00:08:37,880
Let's get through it

295
00:08:38,430 --> 00:08:40,040
I want to go by foot

296
00:08:39,840 --> 00:08:41,200
I don't like this part

297
00:08:41,010 --> 00:08:43,140
Are we not allowed to walk to the Omame Institute?

298
00:08:43,140 --> 00:08:46,510
We're taking the bus

299
00:08:44,890 --> 00:08:46,580
Here's where it starts

300
00:08:46,690 --> 00:08:47,850
I'll go first

301
00:08:48,140 --> 00:08:49,280
Please do

302
00:08:50,890 --> 00:08:53,960
Treat me well...

303
00:08:56,160 --> 00:08:59,230
No Laughing Treasure Hunters 24 hours

304
00:09:00,860 --> 00:09:02,930
Yep, that's how it is...

305
00:09:02,930 --> 00:09:05,670
...No, that's wrong

306
00:09:05,670 --> 00:09:08,440
This isn't okay

307
00:09:09,340 --> 00:09:11,840
You can't just stay out here

308
00:09:12,650 --> 00:09:13,820
What?!

309
00:09:14,630 --> 00:09:16,320
I got off the damn bus!!

310
00:09:15,050 --> 00:09:16,500
I laughed after getting off!!

311
00:09:17,090 --> 00:09:18,180
I got on and

312
00:09:18,180 --> 00:09:20,250
then got off again!

313
00:09:19,310 --> 00:09:20,780
It starts when you get on so

314
00:09:20,680 --> 00:09:22,250
How many times have we done this?

315
00:09:24,520 --> 00:09:26,330
They don't appear for this kind of thing, I think

316
00:09:24,850 --> 00:09:27,620
Receive a slap on the ass \nfrom the Black Army

317
00:09:27,430 --> 00:09:29,580
If you do a flashback, you'll see that it doesn't happen

318
00:09:29,860 --> 00:09:31,660
Enough of this!

319
00:09:32,480 --> 00:09:34,160
Getting on, getting on

320
00:09:35,160 --> 00:09:36,300
Get this underway

321
00:09:35,690 --> 00:09:36,570
Here we go

322
00:09:37,030 --> 00:09:40,170
This place is pretty sweet though

323
00:09:38,950 --> 00:09:41,120
Sit in our regular seats

324
00:09:40,960 --> 00:09:42,100
The seats seem to be...

325
00:09:41,910 --> 00:09:42,740
Over here

326
00:09:43,430 --> 00:09:45,220
They got seat dividers too

327
00:09:45,370 --> 00:09:53,980
As they set off for the lab, what will happen next?

328
00:09:46,060 --> 00:09:49,210
They've finally started moving toward the institute,

329
00:09:49,830 --> 00:09:52,950
Who knows what will happen from now on!

330
00:09:54,750 --> 00:10:03,020
As if waiting for the curtain to rise,

331
00:09:54,750 --> 00:10:03,020
the laughter assassins are now ready to appear

332
00:10:05,240 --> 00:10:05,590
Arriving at a bus stop

333
00:10:05,590 --> 00:10:10,400
Arriving at a bus stop

334
00:10:06,030 --> 00:10:07,010
Arriving at a bus stop

335
00:10:09,200 --> 00:10:11,330
What have we got here?

336
00:10:19,160 --> 00:10:21,650
The worst, seriously!

337
00:10:21,900 --> 00:10:23,010
Whadya want?

338
00:10:23,510 --> 00:10:25,740
Don't be staring at West High's boss, Yuko-san!

339
00:10:23,640 --> 00:10:27,320
Masayasu Wakabayashi

340
00:10:23,640 --> 00:10:27,320
Underling

341
00:10:23,640 --> 00:10:27,320
West High's Boss

342
00:10:23,640 --> 00:10:27,320
Yuki Himura

343
00:10:25,740 --> 00:10:27,460
Don't be staring at West High's boss, Yuko-san!

344
00:10:27,460 --> 00:10:28,100
Knock it off, Waka, you asshole!!

345
00:10:28,100 --> 00:10:30,630
Knock it off, Waka, you asshole!!

346
00:10:29,520 --> 00:10:30,360
Sorry

347
00:10:30,620 --> 00:10:31,990
What good is there in picking a fight with normal civilians?

348
00:10:31,990 --> 00:10:35,040
What good is there in picking a fight with normal civilians?

349
00:10:34,040 --> 00:10:34,810
Sorry

350
00:10:35,330 --> 00:10:36,210
But Yuko-senpai

351
00:10:35,330 --> 00:10:38,860
T/N: Senpai is used as a suffix for people who are above you in grade, rank, etc.

352
00:10:36,990 --> 00:10:38,860
Why did we come to a place like this?

353
00:10:38,860 --> 00:10:41,230
Cuz of Haruna from East High

354
00:10:41,230 --> 00:10:42,600
Yuko, that's bad!

355
00:10:42,600 --> 00:10:52,070
A battle of the leaders

356
00:10:42,600 --> 00:10:52,070
East High

357
00:10:42,600 --> 00:10:52,070
West High

358
00:10:43,330 --> 00:10:46,650
When East High's Haruna snaps, she's untouchable

359
00:10:46,650 --> 00:10:48,460
the cruelest boss in town!

360
00:10:48,980 --> 00:10:50,250
Even a great leader like you will be sent to the hospital!

361
00:10:50,250 --> 00:10:52,040
Even a great leader like you will be sent to the hospital!

362
00:10:52,710 --> 00:10:55,510
I've got no choice, dumbass!

363
00:10:59,750 --> 00:11:00,960
Yuko!

00:11:01,120 --> 00:11:06,320
East High Boss

Haruna Kawaguchi

366
00:11:01,860 --> 00:11:03,920
If it isn't the small fry West High scum

367
00:11:04,250 --> 00:11:05,920
Don't mess with me, bitch!

368
00:11:06,320 --> 00:11:09,060
Who you calling small fry?

369
00:11:09,060 --> 00:11:10,890
Come at me, you toad

370
00:11:09,960 --> 00:11:11,460
Did you just call me a toad?!

371
00:11:10,480 --> 00:11:12,030
Don't mess with me!

372
00:11:11,490 --> 00:11:13,530
Who do you think you're talking to?

373
00:11:12,290 --> 00:11:13,530
You got a problem?

374
00:11:13,530 --> 00:11:15,530
Hey you with the lips

375
00:11:13,530 --> 00:11:15,530
Let's go!

376
00:11:13,530 --> 00:11:15,530
Try me!

377
00:11:15,530 --> 00:11:17,050
Stop them!

378
00:11:15,530 --> 00:11:21,940
Asks to stop their fighting

379
00:11:15,530 --> 00:11:21,940
Underling Wakabayashi's Plea

380
00:11:17,860 --> 00:11:19,050
Come on, stop them!

381
00:11:20,910 --> 00:11:22,590

383
00:11:24,170 --> 00:11:27,610
SHUT UP AND SIT DOWN, MIDGET!!

384
00:11:27,610 --> 00:11:29,340
Midget, really...

385
00:11:28,190 --> 00:11:30,320
I didn't even say anything

386
00:11:30,740 --> 00:11:32,300
Coming at me like that...

387
00:11:32,490 --> 00:11:34,150
If the teenage drama "Code Blue"

388
00:11:34,150 --> 00:11:35,450
If the teenage drama "Code Blue"

389
00:11:35,450 --> 00:11:36,950
can capture your interest every week, and make you weep,

390
00:11:36,950 --> 00:11:37,920
can capture your interest every week, and make you weep,

391
00:11:37,920 --> 00:11:41,220
an eyesore of an entertainer like you

392
00:11:38,890 --> 00:11:41,220
has got no business telling me what to do!

393
00:11:41,220 --> 00:11:46,460
An old fart nearing his 60th birthday who watches "Cold Blue"

394
00:11:43,290 --> 00:11:44,160
like a die hard fan is quite something!

395
00:11:44,160 --> 00:11:46,460
like a die hard fan is quite something!

396
00:11:46,460 --> 00:11:48,030
She's got a point

397
00:11:48,030 --> 00:11:50,300
I was watching it, but it wasn't...

398
00:11:50,340 --> 00:11:51,700
Also

399
00:11:51,660 --> 00:11:55,870
You promised to go to your wife's show

400
00:11:53,610 --> 00:11:55,870
which is great and all

401
00:11:55,870 --> 00:11:57,140
but then you overslept and ran late, so

402
00:11:57,140 --> 00:11:57,810
she made you beg for forgiveness on your hands and knees backstage

403
00:11:57,810 --> 00:11:58,540
she made you beg for forgiveness on your hands and knees backstage

404
00:11:58,540 --> 00:12:04,010
she made you beg for forgiveness on your hands and knees backstage

405
00:12:03,300 --> 00:12:06,010
No, wait

406
00:12:04,010 --> 00:12:06,350
She really has that much power over you?

407
00:12:06,010 --> 00:12:08,010
I wasn't on my hands and knees

408
00:12:09,020 --> 00:12:14,190
You're just worn out garbage

409
00:12:10,950 --> 00:12:14,190
T/N: Shimoda Kageki is a 78-year-old author and actor with a really eccentric look.

410
00:12:10,950 --> 00:12:14,190
just like Shimoda Kageki

411
00:12:16,670 --> 00:12:19,490
I didn't know about that

412
00:12:19,490 --> 00:12:21,490
On your hands and knees!?

413
00:12:21,060 --> 00:12:22,720
No, I wasn't!

414
00:12:22,940 --> 00:12:25,270
But I definitely was late!

415
00:12:27,550 --> 00:12:29,240
Watching Code Blue is up there too

416
00:12:30,100 --> 00:12:31,470
I just watched it once

417
00:12:31,900 --> 00:12:33,940
Bring it on you bitch!

418
00:12:33,250 --> 00:12:35,010
Let's go, toad face

419
00:12:35,010 --> 00:12:38,550
T/N: Inari is a sushi dish made of a fried tofu skin pouch with sushi rice inside.

420
00:12:35,010 --> 00:12:38,550
Your face looks like rotten inari sushi

421
00:12:37,090 --> 00:12:39,750
Who you calling rotten inari face?

422
00:12:38,660 --> 00:12:39,750
Of course, you!

423
00:12:39,750 --> 00:12:40,910
Hey baldy, could you stop their fighting?

424
00:12:40,910 --> 00:12:43,980
Hey baldy, could you stop their fighting?

425
00:12:45,220 --> 00:12:47,960
Baldy, get over here and stop them

426
00:12:48,250 --> 00:12:50,460
Is that how this is going to play out?

427
00:12:50,460 --> 00:12:51,960
Excuse me could you plea-

428
00:12:51,960 --> 00:12:53,630
SHUT UP, RAKUGO COMEDIAN!!

429
00:12:53,630 --> 00:12:56,260
JUST GO SIT DOWN, LIKE YOUR RAKUGO SKITS

430
00:12:56,260 --> 00:13:00,370
HURRY UP AND SIT DOWN

431
00:13:01,570 --> 00:13:03,600
While trying to setup this scene

432
00:13:03,600 --> 00:13:07,540
Gaki no Tsukai staff

433
00:13:04,770 --> 00:13:07,540
sent out requests for any juicy information

434
00:13:07,540 --> 00:13:11,480
T/N: Osaka Honwaka TV is a variety show that airs on Sunday nights. Some big name comedians are on the show, but it's not nearly as popular as other big name varieties.

435
00:13:07,540 --> 00:13:11,480
and nobody but Osaka Honwaka TV's assistant producer

436
00:13:09,680 --> 00:13:10,410
responded for a piece of garbage like you

437
00:13:10,410 --> 00:13:11,480
responded for a piece of garbage like you

438
00:13:11,480 --> 00:13:15,050
You got no place to stick your nose in other's fights

439
00:13:15,050 --> 00:13:18,920
Just how few goddamn connections do you have!?

440
00:13:19,450 --> 00:13:22,990
Honwaka's assistant producer shared

441
00:13:19,450 --> 00:13:22,990
this story with us

442
00:13:23,060 --> 00:13:35,900
From Osaka Honwaka TV's Assistant Producer

443
00:13:23,910 --> 00:13:31,630
Whenever we record with Hosei-san, we provide an

444
00:13:27,890 --> 00:13:31,630
assortment of dishes a la carte for his catering needs, but

445
00:13:31,630 --> 00:13:35,900
T/N: Hineri Age is a lightly fried rice cracker snack. Pretty plain and ordinary.

446
00:13:31,630 --> 00:13:35,900
he eats nothing but Hineri Age snacks

447
00:13:35,900 --> 00:13:37,840
Isn't that just the weakest excuse for a scoop!!

448
00:13:38,370 --> 00:13:41,310
How the hell are you this boring that you only have this story?!

449
00:13:41,810 --> 00:13:44,580
There's more from that assistant producer

450
00:13:45,040 --> 00:13:46,580
From the same assistant producer

451
00:13:46,580 --> 00:13:59,690
From Osaka Honwaka TV's Assistant Producer

452
00:13:47,480 --> 00:13:52,790
He has a habit of writing things down so he doesn't

453
00:13:50,520 --> 00:13:52,790
forget anything, but

454
00:13:52,790 --> 00:13:59,690
since he writes with such huge letters

455
00:13:56,140 --> 00:13:59,690
he has to replace his notebook every week

456
00:13:59,690 --> 00:14:03,430
What's with this bullshit excuse for a story!

457
00:14:03,430 --> 00:14:06,670
Even the assistant producer was struggling to write this shit

458
00:14:13,370 --> 00:14:15,490
Hosei didn't even do anything bad

459
00:14:15,780 --> 00:14:16,630
Right?

460
00:14:16,630 --> 00:14:18,630
Nobody thought ill of you

461
00:14:20,610 --> 00:14:24,180
Well then

462
00:14:21,610 --> 00:14:24,180
are we gonna go at it or not, make up your mind!

463
00:14:23,720 --> 00:14:25,650
What's holding you back? Let's go, ugly!

464
00:14:25,650 --> 00:14:27,370
You're the one who's scared!

465
00:14:28,590 --> 00:14:29,590
You two, the ones without any presence, could you stop them?

466
00:14:29,590 --> 00:14:32,630
You two, the ones without any presence, could you stop them?

467
00:14:32,630 --> 00:14:34,400
Absolutely no presence

468
00:14:34,480 --> 00:14:36,400
Ah excuse me

469
00:14:34,480 --> 00:14:36,400
Ah excuse me

470
00:14:35,630 --> 00:14:36,860
Don't even bother getting up

471
00:14:36,860 --> 00:14:41,200
You guys aren't successful enough to bother with

472
00:14:42,400 --> 00:14:45,370
Isn't that a bit harsh?

473
00:14:46,770 --> 00:14:49,610
Shut up divorcee combo

474
00:14:55,620 --> 00:14:57,720
Couldn't help that one, eh?

475
00:14:57,890 --> 00:15:00,550
Don't say it like that

476
00:14:58,580 --> 00:15:00,980
Absolutely insane

477
00:15:02,190 --> 00:15:03,060
Nothing?

478
00:15:03,060 --> 00:15:04,390
Yeah really, nothing?

479
00:15:04,390 --> 00:15:07,060
I feel a bit left out...

480
00:15:07,060 --> 00:15:09,730
Hurry up and bring it!

481
00:15:07,060 --> 00:15:09,730
What're you gonna do bitch?

482
00:15:10,200 --> 00:15:10,860
Hey muscle head help me out here!

483
00:15:10,860 --> 00:15:15,170
Hey muscle head help me out here!

484
00:15:18,690 --> 00:15:19,160
Excuse me-

485
00:15:19,160 --> 00:15:21,410
SHUT UP, PROTEIN!!

486
00:15:22,280 --> 00:15:25,510
Does anyone say that?

487
00:15:23,460 --> 00:15:25,510
"Shut up, protein"?

488
00:15:27,410 --> 00:15:28,950
Does anyone say that?

489
00:15:28,240 --> 00:15:29,750
Protein!

490
00:15:28,950 --> 00:15:29,380
Sit down protein!!

491
00:15:29,380 --> 00:15:31,790
Sit down protein!!

492
00:15:31,050 --> 00:15:33,050
"Sit down protein!"

493
00:15:33,650 --> 00:15:37,120
On your daughter's birthday

494
00:15:35,290 --> 00:15:37,120
you tried to secretly buy her a handbag

495
00:15:37,120 --> 00:15:40,230
and trying to get her to laugh, in that handbag

496
00:15:40,230 --> 00:15:42,400
you put in your own action figure

497
00:15:42,400 --> 00:15:46,000
She was so excited about the handbag

498
00:15:44,360 --> 00:15:45,990
that she ignored your action figure

499
00:15:46,010 --> 00:15:50,940
The biggest entertainment failure of the year

500
00:15:47,370 --> 00:15:50,940
isn't going to come busting in here, dumbass!

501
00:15:51,470 --> 00:15:53,440
Seriously, who told you that?

502
00:15:54,710 --> 00:15:56,210
Then you went to Disneyland

503
00:15:56,840 --> 00:16:02,020
and you bought a Mickey Mouse tank top

504
00:15:58,610 --> 00:15:59,380
and went to the bathroom to change like a high school girl

505
00:15:59,380 --> 00:16:02,020
and went to the bathroom to change like a high school girl

506
00:16:02,020 --> 00:16:03,820
Seriously!?

507
00:16:03,820 --> 00:16:05,820
What's with this entertainer in drag, huh?

508
00:16:07,820 --> 00:16:09,790
Honestly, I thought that would make me stand out less

509
00:16:09,790 --> 00:16:12,830
Hey Waka,

510
00:16:09,790 --> 00:16:12,830
you got a picture of that?

511
00:16:11,540 --> 00:16:12,810
Yeah, I do

512
00:16:14,940 --> 00:16:16,460
You thought that wouldn't stand out!?

513
00:16:16,460 --> 00:16:19,630
He's totally a cross-dresser

514
00:16:20,600 --> 00:16:23,040
That was only the first one

515
00:16:25,070 --> 00:16:29,010
Don't be bringing down dream land!

516
00:16:29,010 --> 00:16:30,170
It's obvious that it's you

517
00:16:30,210 --> 00:16:31,550
You can see it

518
00:16:31,550 --> 00:16:36,380
Why are you showing off your muscles while hiding your face?

519
00:16:39,920 --> 00:16:40,690
Scary...

520
00:16:41,360 --> 00:16:43,960
The delinquents are scary here

521
00:16:47,830 --> 00:16:51,270
Alright let's get out of here, Waka

522
00:16:52,030 --> 00:16:54,500
Please don't leave the picture behind

523
00:16:55,840 --> 00:16:58,310
Amazing levels of aggression from that one

524
00:16:58,440 --> 00:17:01,280
Only 30 minutes since starting

525
00:16:58,440 --> 00:17:01,280
Only 30 minutes since starting

526
00:16:58,440 --> 00:17:01,280
Only 30 minutes since starting

527
00:16:58,440 --> 00:17:01,280
Only 30 minutes since starting

528
00:17:01,420 --> 00:17:08,080
A rush of punishments

529
00:17:01,420 --> 00:17:08,080
A rush of punishments

530
00:17:01,420 --> 00:17:08,080
A rush of punishments

531
00:17:01,420 --> 00:17:08,080
A rush of punishments

532
00:17:01,420 --> 00:17:08,080
The five's tension

533
00:17:01,420 --> 00:17:08,080
The five's tension

534
00:17:01,420 --> 00:17:08,080
The five's tension

535
00:17:01,420 --> 00:17:08,080
The five's tension

536
00:17:01,420 --> 00:17:08,080
The five's tension

537
00:17:01,420 --> 00:17:08,080
will only fall from here

538
00:17:01,420 --> 00:17:08,080
will only fall from here

539
00:17:01,420 --> 00:17:08,080
will only fall from here

540
00:17:01,420 --> 00:17:08,080
will only fall from here

541
00:17:01,420 --> 00:17:08,080
will only fall from here

542
00:17:08,250 --> 00:17:14,320
But more assassins await

543
00:17:08,250 --> 00:17:14,320
But more assassins await

544
00:17:08,250 --> 00:17:14,320
But more assassins await

545
00:17:08,250 --> 00:17:14,320
and by no means

546
00:17:08,250 --> 00:17:14,320
and by no means

547
00:17:08,250 --> 00:17:14,320
and by no means

548
00:17:08,250 --> 00:17:14,320
are they letting up

549
00:17:08,250 --> 00:17:14,320
are they letting up

550
00:17:08,250 --> 00:17:14,320
are they letting up

551
00:17:14,960 --> 00:17:15,650
Huh? Looks like we're stopping

552
00:17:15,650 --> 00:17:17,320
Huh? Looks like we're stopping

553
00:17:18,360 --> 00:17:19,320
Yeah really

554
00:17:19,930 --> 00:17:21,760
They're working over there

555
00:17:21,760 --> 00:17:26,330
Stopping in the peaceful countryside

556
00:17:29,700 --> 00:17:32,810
A standup mic

557
00:17:32,840 --> 00:17:34,270

00:17:37,910 --> 00:17:40,780
We can't allow another relapse

Manzai is a challenging ordeal, a path of greatest resistance we chose

561
00:17:44,550 --> 00:17:48,460
A year since their tragic failing

562
00:17:44,550 --> 00:17:48,460
T/N: In the American Police Batsu, Chidori told a joke that no one laughed at.

563
00:17:48,460 --> 00:17:52,990
This year, we'll absolutely make sure they laugh

564
00:17:52,990 --> 00:17:56,930
The reborn Chidori has arrived

565
00:17:56,930 --> 00:18:00,050

566
00:17:56,930 --> 00:18:00,050

Hello! Thanks for having us!

582
00:18:22,560 --> 00:18:23,620
We are Chidori

583
00:18:25,710 --> 00:18:27,260
When I get a vacation,

584
00:18:27,260 --> 00:18:28,700
I'd like to take my family somewhere

585
00:18:28,700 --> 00:18:30,330
Taking good care of your family

586
00:18:30,330 --> 00:18:32,680
T/N: Ryokan is a traditional Japanese inn.

587
00:18:30,330 --> 00:18:32,680
but I don't really know how to make reservations at a ryokan

588
00:18:32,680 --> 00:18:34,930
That's easy though

589
00:18:34,780 --> 00:18:35,520
Really?

590
00:18:34,930 --> 00:18:36,650
All you have to do is call, I'll show you

591
00:18:36,650 --> 00:18:38,830
Dialing: Beep boop beep boop, ring ring ring

592
00:18:38,830 --> 00:18:39,620
Hello?

593
00:18:39,620 --> 00:18:42,080
T/N: Hakubei is a character that Chidori uses in their skits. Hakubei is an elderly person that constantly misunderstands things.

594
00:18:39,620 --> 00:18:42,080
This is the Kisuikan's head hostess, Hakubei

595
00:18:42,080 --> 00:18:44,660
Hakubei? What an amazing name you have

596
00:18:44,290 --> 00:18:45,480
It's spelled with the kanji Shiro (白) and Taira (平)

597
00:18:45,480 --> 00:18:47,540
I don't really care about a name like that

598
00:18:47,540 --> 00:18:50,340
I'd like to make a reservation for my family of three this weekend

599
00:18:49,720 --> 00:18:50,920
Thank you very much

600
00:18:50,920 --> 00:18:53,630
I'd like to confirm your reservation

Chiben Wakayama High School Baseball Club, 80 people

602
00:18:57,160 --> 00:18:59,160
That's incorrect, you're mistaken

603
00:18:59,160 --> 00:19:01,360
Would you be interested in our all-you-can-eat Chinese buffet?

604
00:19:00,330 --> 00:19:02,630
No thanks, I don't want a Chinese buffet at a Japanese inn

605
00:19:02,630 --> 00:19:03,260
A mistake?

606
00:19:03,260 --> 00:19:05,600
Yes, a family of three

607
00:19:05,030 --> 00:19:07,030
You're correct

608
00:19:05,600 --> 00:19:07,030
Of course I am

609
00:19:07,030 --> 00:19:08,410
I'm terribly sorry for the mistake

610
00:19:08,410 --> 00:19:09,120
Uhh...

611
00:19:09,120 --> 00:19:10,630
As an apology...

612
00:19:10,630 --> 00:19:13,050
I'll upgrade your meals to the highest quality

613
00:19:12,590 --> 00:19:14,140
Everyone's focused

614
00:19:13,050 --> 00:19:16,570
I'd like to confirm your reservation again

615
00:19:15,610 --> 00:19:16,980
Is he getting nervous?

616
00:19:16,560 --> 00:19:19,950
Chiben Wakayama High School Baseball Club, 80 people

617
00:19:16,980 --> 00:19:18,580
Yeah

618
00:19:19,950 --> 00:19:21,150
NO! Forget it!

619
00:19:21,150 --> 00:19:23,150
Thank you very much!

620
00:19:21,150 --> 00:19:23,150
Thank you very much!

621
00:19:27,220 --> 00:19:30,720
THEY DIDN'T LAUGH AT ALL!!

622
00:19:31,690 --> 00:19:34,560
He stumbled a bit

623
00:19:32,160 --> 00:19:34,160
They didn't laugh at even one joke!!

624
00:19:35,700 --> 00:19:37,730
Something's off!!

625
00:19:37,730 --> 00:19:39,090
What!

626
00:19:39,750 --> 00:19:41,600
Your suit is way too huge!

627
00:19:41,600 --> 00:19:49,380
Daigo's suit is too big

628
00:19:41,600 --> 00:19:49,380
Daigo's suit is too big

629
00:19:41,600 --> 00:19:49,380
The reason they didn't get a laugh

630
00:19:41,630 --> 00:19:44,080
No it's not!

631
00:19:44,200 --> 00:19:45,140
Yes it is

632
00:19:45,140 --> 00:19:46,100
It's huge!

633
00:19:46,100 --> 00:19:49,380
The size of your suit has no impact on the comedy!!

634
00:19:49,840 --> 00:19:51,310
It's ridiculously big!

635
00:19:51,310 --> 00:19:52,150
It was distracting

636
00:19:52,140 --> 00:19:54,310
This isn't a size for a young man

637
00:19:54,390 --> 00:19:56,520
That's just how suits are

638
00:19:57,180 --> 00:19:59,610
That looks like the size of TOMMY's Masa-san

639
00:19:59,850 --> 00:20:02,820
Doesn't matter if we wore Masa-san's size

640
00:20:02,820 --> 00:20:03,460
So, let's go for tight

641
00:20:03,460 --> 00:20:04,930
So, let's go for tight

642
00:20:04,930 --> 00:20:07,090
So if we change our suits it'd be fine

643
00:20:06,030 --> 00:20:07,090
Let's go change!

644
00:20:11,000 --> 00:20:13,930
No, that was Hamada

645
00:20:13,930 --> 00:20:16,840
You laughed when he said Chiben Wakayama

646
00:20:16,040 --> 00:20:16,840
That's not it

647
00:20:16,840 --> 00:20:18,110
He didn't say Chiben Wakayama properly

648
00:20:18,110 --> 00:20:19,940
He didn't say Chiben Wakayama properly

649
00:20:18,590 --> 00:20:19,940
Oh right, that's what it was

650
00:20:18,940 --> 00:20:20,560
Seriously

651
00:20:19,940 --> 00:20:22,270
So that was why?

652
00:20:21,580 --> 00:20:24,380
It was because he flubbed his line

653
00:20:28,980 --> 00:20:30,050
Hello!

654
00:20:30,050 --> 00:20:31,960
Excuse us, hello

655
00:20:30,050 --> 00:20:32,480
Excuse us, let's begin

656
00:20:32,500 --> 00:20:34,680
You know, I want to go on a trip

657
00:20:34,670 --> 00:20:35,900
Oh that's a nice idea

658
00:20:35,960 --> 00:20:37,200
It's just that I don't know how to make a reservation

659
00:20:37,170 --> 00:20:39,000
That's easy, all you do is call

660
00:20:38,800 --> 00:20:39,500
Is that so?

661
00:20:39,200 --> 00:20:41,100
Yeah, so here, let's try calling

662
00:20:41,080 --> 00:20:43,050
Beep boop beep boop, ring ring ring

663
00:20:43,050 --> 00:20:46,500
Hello, this is Kisuikan's head hostess, Hakubei

664
00:20:45,680 --> 00:20:48,400
Whatever about your name, Hakubei

665
00:20:47,020 --> 00:20:49,020
It's spelled with the kanji Shiro (白) and Taira (平)

666
00:20:48,480 --> 00:20:49,980
I don't really care about the "Shiro" or "Taira"

667
00:20:50,200 --> 00:20:53,070
I'd like to make a reservation for my family of three this weekend

668
00:20:53,070 --> 00:20:56,110
Is that so? Then I'd like to confirm your reservation

669
00:20:56,110 --> 00:20:58,910
Chiben Wakayama High School Baseball Club, 80 people

670
00:20:58,910 --> 00:20:59,900
No, that's wrong!

671
00:20:59,710 --> 00:21:02,200
Would you be interested in our all-you-can-eat Chinese buffet?

672
00:21:01,150 --> 00:21:03,500
No, I don't need that! It's just for a family of three!

673
00:21:03,400 --> 00:21:04,840
You're correct

674
00:21:04,850 --> 00:21:06,490
My sincere apologies!

675
00:21:06,020 --> 00:21:07,700
It's fine, please hurry it up

676
00:21:06,690 --> 00:21:09,320
I'd like to confirm your reservation again

677
00:21:09,320 --> 00:21:12,280
Chiben Wakayama High School Baseball Club, 80 people

678
00:21:12,090 --> 00:21:13,330
No, forget it!

679
00:21:13,330 --> 00:21:13,760
Thank you very much!

680
00:21:13,330 --> 00:21:13,760
Thank you very much!

681
00:21:13,760 --> 00:21:15,930
Thank you very much!

682
00:21:13,760 --> 00:21:15,930
Thank you very much!

683
00:21:17,600 --> 00:21:19,500
I TOLD YOU!!

684
00:21:18,660 --> 00:21:19,500
What?!

685
00:21:19,500 --> 00:21:22,170
Not ONE of those jokes landed

686
00:21:22,170 --> 00:21:24,200
Because of your beads!!

687
00:21:22,170 --> 00:21:26,570
T/N: He's referring the the Buddhist prayer bead bracelet. A fashionable item that many people believe to have spiritual energy.

688
00:21:24,240 --> 00:21:26,570
That had nothing to do with it

689
00:21:26,570 --> 00:21:28,740
You're emphasizing them too much!

690
00:21:28,740 --> 00:21:30,910
What?

691
00:21:29,910 --> 00:21:30,910
THE BEADS!

692
00:21:30,910 --> 00:21:36,750
Reason the stand-up failed

693
00:21:30,910 --> 00:21:36,750
The beads were too intense

694
00:21:32,860 --> 00:21:36,220
They were a good luck charm, that's normal in comedy

695
00:21:34,330 --> 00:21:36,950
What the hell was that?

696
00:21:37,550 --> 00:21:38,890
They look like a wallet chain that hangs from your back pocket

697
00:21:38,890 --> 00:21:41,420
They look like a wallet chain that hangs from your back pocket

698
00:21:42,820 --> 00:21:43,160
I really hate thwose

699
00:21:43,160 --> 00:21:44,990
I really hate thwose

700
00:21:46,830 --> 00:21:50,100
What the hell is "thwose"?!

701
00:21:48,940 --> 00:21:51,300
Let's calm down

702
00:21:51,300 --> 00:21:56,500
We're messing up all of our words

703
00:21:52,180 --> 00:21:53,350
The both of them are fumbling!

704
00:22:11,120 --> 00:22:13,650
They are really working hard out there

705
00:22:13,650 --> 00:22:17,620
Out the window, farmers at work

706
00:22:18,160 --> 00:22:21,480
Hello! We are Chidori

707
00:22:21,480 --> 00:22:24,950
You know, when you have a day off, you want to go somewhere, right?

708
00:22:24,950 --> 00:22:26,430
That's true, that's true

709
00:22:26,430 --> 00:22:31,300
But I just don't know how to book a ryokon

710
00:22:26,430 --> 00:22:31,300
T/N: The proper word is "ryokan".

711
00:22:28,240 --> 00:22:31,300
A "ryokon?"

712
00:22:32,540 --> 00:22:34,540
Beep boop beep boop, ring ring ring

713
00:22:33,470 --> 00:22:35,820
The third attempt was THIS?!

714
00:22:35,340 --> 00:22:39,090
Hello, this is the Kisuikan's head hostess, Hakubei

715
00:22:38,460 --> 00:22:40,890
Hakubei? What an amazing name you have

716
00:22:40,100 --> 00:22:41,590
It's spelled with the kanji Shiro (白) and Taira (平)

717
00:22:41,610 --> 00:22:43,610
I don't really care about the "Shiro" or "Taira"

718
00:22:42,380 --> 00:22:42,550
Fu Ha Fu

719
00:22:42,550 --> 00:22:42,800
Fu ha ha

720
00:22:42,780 --> 00:22:43,750
Fu ha ha...

721
00:22:43,330 --> 00:22:44,800
You may go ahead and laugh

722
00:22:43,750 --> 00:22:45,620
Hold on, hold on!!

723
00:22:45,620 --> 00:22:47,620
Look

724
00:22:49,090 --> 00:22:53,860
A sudden fire!!

725
00:22:55,000 --> 00:22:56,060
Wait!!

726
00:22:56,060 --> 00:22:56,330
Wait!!

727
00:22:56,330 --> 00:22:56,860
WAIT!!

728
00:22:56,860 --> 00:22:58,360
WAIT!!

729
00:22:57,460 --> 00:22:58,350
Forget about your manzai for a minute!

730
00:22:58,360 --> 00:23:01,500
Oh man, seriously

731
00:22:58,360 --> 00:23:01,500
Wait, behind you, hold on

732
00:23:02,650 --> 00:23:03,770
HEY~!

733
00:23:04,140 --> 00:23:06,210
A field fire!

734
00:23:04,190 --> 00:23:05,470
It's a field fire!

735
00:23:06,220 --> 00:23:07,970
HEY, OLD GEEZER!

736
00:23:06,660 --> 00:23:07,970
HEY, OLD GEEZER!

737
00:23:07,970 --> 00:23:09,040
WE'RE TRYING TO DO STAND-UP!

738
00:23:09,040 --> 00:23:10,280
HEY!

739
00:23:10,280 --> 00:23:12,950
Did you light a goddamn tire on fire?!

740
00:23:13,580 --> 00:23:16,820
This is a critical moment, what are ya doin'?!

741
00:23:19,650 --> 00:23:21,050
The bucket...

742
00:23:21,050 --> 00:23:22,390
Ma'am!

743
00:23:22,760 --> 00:23:24,260
That bucket's not going to be enough

744
00:23:23,070 --> 00:23:23,840
Ma'am!

745
00:23:24,270 --> 00:23:26,660
Ma'am, run faster!

746
00:23:25,340 --> 00:23:26,660
Ma'am, run faster!

747
00:23:27,530 --> 00:23:29,600
Are they gonna be okay?

748
00:23:28,430 --> 00:23:29,600
This is ridiculous

749
00:23:30,300 --> 00:23:31,600
No way, this is really...

750
00:23:31,600 --> 00:23:34,200
With that bucket it's impossible.

751
00:23:32,500 --> 00:23:34,200
CUT IT OUT!

752
00:23:34,200 --> 00:23:35,900
What are they doing?

753
00:23:35,900 --> 00:23:39,170
That surprised me!!

754
00:23:36,850 --> 00:23:39,170
What the heck?

755
00:23:39,170 --> 00:23:41,660
Ah, I guess Chidori is going to help out

756
00:23:41,790 --> 00:23:43,360
Are you guys okay?!

757
00:23:43,910 --> 00:23:47,450
Daigo really messed up his lines

758
00:23:45,860 --> 00:23:47,910
He screwed up saying "ryokan"

759
00:23:47,910 --> 00:23:50,450
What the hell were you burning to make this big ass fire?!

760
00:23:51,520 --> 00:23:53,220
Why are they running away though?

761
00:23:53,220 --> 00:23:55,320
Aren't they mad?

762
00:23:55,320 --> 00:23:57,560
I guess?

763
00:23:55,320 --> 00:23:57,560
Who knows

764
00:23:58,610 --> 00:24:06,800
The research institute is almost within view

765
00:23:58,610 --> 00:24:06,800
The long ride is almost at an end

766
00:24:07,630 --> 00:24:09,500
We're almost there!

767
00:24:08,420 --> 00:24:10,600
Are we?

768
00:24:10,950 --> 00:24:13,060
Now, the five new recruits

769
00:24:13,060 --> 00:24:15,860
can see the institute from the bus window

770
00:24:15,990 --> 00:24:19,410
But this isn't the finishing line

771
00:24:19,600 --> 00:24:23,280
A new battlefield awaits them

772
00:24:24,720 --> 00:24:25,180
Oh, we're here!!

773
00:24:25,180 --> 00:24:27,050
Oh, we're here!!

774
00:24:25,780 --> 00:24:27,050
Finally...

775
00:24:29,150 --> 00:24:35,130
The Heipo Foundation Archaeological Institute of Omame

776
00:24:29,340 --> 00:24:35,130
The location this time:

777
00:24:35,340 --> 00:24:44,870
An institute to find treasure and generate laughs

778
00:24:35,340 --> 00:24:44,870
Assassins and fierce battles will soon appear...

779
00:24:44,870 --> 00:24:46,170
An institute to find treasure and generate laughs

780
00:24:44,870 --> 00:24:46,170
Assassins and fierce battles will soon appear...

781
00:24:46,170 --> 00:24:51,640
Arrival at the research institute

782
00:24:47,860 --> 00:24:51,640
Let's go, we're here

783
00:24:47,860 --> 00:24:51,640
Let's go

784
00:24:47,860 --> 00:24:51,640
We're really here

785
00:24:52,450 --> 00:24:53,850
We made it

786
00:24:55,760 --> 00:24:59,650
This is a statue of the founder of the institute, Heipo

787
00:24:59,400 --> 00:25:00,110
I see

788
00:24:59,650 --> 00:25:01,400
Isn't he cute?

789
00:25:00,500 --> 00:25:05,620
Heipo

790
00:25:00,500 --> 00:25:05,620
Research Institute Founder

791
00:25:01,800 --> 00:25:05,620
Is "cute" the right word?

792
00:25:06,990 --> 00:25:09,700
Isn't his face frickin' huge!?

793
00:25:06,990 --> 00:25:10,230
It's pretty big. Let's go

794
00:25:10,750 --> 00:25:21,110
3rd Floor Hallway

795
00:25:15,440 --> 00:25:18,770
Here's the training room everyone

796
00:25:18,770 --> 00:25:21,110
stand by for your instructions

797
00:25:18,770 --> 00:25:21,110
For now, wait here and

798
00:25:22,410 --> 00:25:23,000
Here it is...

799
00:25:23,560 --> 00:25:25,380
Every single time...

800
00:25:24,540 --> 00:25:25,380
Right?

801
00:25:24,880 --> 00:25:29,950
Rookie Training Room

802
00:25:27,450 --> 00:25:29,870
Always this feeling, always this layout...

803
00:25:28,600 --> 00:25:29,870
This again...

804
00:25:30,120 --> 00:25:33,050
Don't open the drawers yet

805
00:25:31,970 --> 00:25:33,490
Alright

806
00:25:32,700 --> 00:25:34,250
Yeah, we already know

807
00:25:35,420 --> 00:25:38,120
There's all this stuff laying around, huh?

808
00:25:36,760 --> 00:25:38,120
There is

809
00:25:38,120 --> 00:25:39,230
Ah... It's really started

810
00:25:39,230 --> 00:25:41,860
Ah... It's really started

811
00:25:40,710 --> 00:25:41,860
It's started alright

812
00:25:41,230 --> 00:25:42,260
You're laughing!

813
00:25:42,260 --> 00:25:46,370
When you said "It's really started" just now,

814
00:25:44,060 --> 00:25:46,370
you were clearly laughing while saying it

815
00:25:46,950 --> 00:25:50,000
No, I just said it cheerfully

816
00:25:49,000 --> 00:25:51,900
No, I don't know, I wish things were a little more strict

817
00:25:51,900 --> 00:25:54,240
If I did that, I'd definitely be out

818
00:25:54,010 --> 00:25:55,570
Poot

819
00:25:56,480 --> 00:25:59,550
Did you just fart?

820
00:25:57,130 --> 00:25:58,280
He farted

821
00:25:58,280 --> 00:25:59,260
He really farted

822
00:26:00,910 --> 00:26:02,980
Huh?

823
00:26:02,780 --> 00:26:03,950
You farted, asshole

824
00:26:03,950 --> 00:26:06,820
Nuh-uh...

825
00:26:08,420 --> 00:26:10,390
What was that?

826
00:26:10,420 --> 00:26:16,000
The five newbies finally get a break

827
00:26:10,420 --> 00:26:16,000
One hour since the start

828
00:26:16,260 --> 00:26:22,900
the terrifying contents of the drawers awaits...

829
00:26:16,260 --> 00:26:22,900
Coming up...

830
00:26:24,990 --> 00:26:28,740
Research Institute - Time elapsed, 1 Hour

831
00:26:24,990 --> 00:26:28,740
But before that, there's an important task

832
00:26:30,640 --> 00:26:32,090
Listen up

833
00:26:32,580 --> 00:26:36,550
Now, you're going to go meet the most respected person,

834
00:26:34,750 --> 00:26:36,550
at the Director's Room to introduce yourselves

835
00:26:35,350 --> 00:26:36,550
Ah, I remember this

836
00:26:36,550 --> 00:26:43,290
New recruits must greet the director

837
00:26:36,550 --> 00:26:43,290
The Archaeological Institute of Omame

838
00:26:37,250 --> 00:26:40,200
Then that should've been the very first thing we do

839
00:26:40,200 --> 00:26:41,070
Seriously

840
00:26:41,070 --> 00:26:42,520
Right?

841
00:26:41,440 --> 00:26:42,350
Yeah

842
00:26:42,500 --> 00:26:44,800
The most respected person...

843
00:26:43,260 --> 00:26:45,260
That's actually pretty rude

844
00:26:46,530 --> 00:26:48,700
Right here, everyone

845
00:26:48,700 --> 00:26:51,730
It was literally right next door

846
00:26:52,060 --> 00:26:52,900
Excuse us!

847
00:26:52,900 --> 00:26:54,470
What a nice room

848
00:26:54,470 --> 00:26:56,470
What a huge room

849
00:26:55,900 --> 00:26:56,470
Seriously

850
00:26:56,640 --> 00:27:00,140
Director's Room

851
00:26:56,690 --> 00:26:58,140
How classy

852
00:26:58,900 --> 00:26:59,820
Alright

853
00:27:00,570 --> 00:27:03,310
It was impossible to know
who it was from behind

854
00:27:02,490 --> 00:27:03,310
It really was

855
00:27:03,080 --> 00:27:05,840
Director, I've brought the five new recruits

856
00:27:07,400 --> 00:27:09,680
So, you've finally arrived

857
00:27:10,170 --> 00:27:12,480
You're frickin' kidding me!

858
00:27:13,450 --> 00:27:16,190
Director, I've brought the five new recruits

859
00:27:17,290 --> 00:27:19,890
So, you've finally arrived

860
00:27:17,410 --> 00:27:19,690
Director of the Research Department

861
00:27:17,410 --> 00:27:19,690
Furutachi Ichiro

862
00:27:17,410 --> 00:27:19,690
T/N: Furutachi Ichiro is a very famous announcer, tarento, presenter, and newscaster.

863
00:27:19,890 --> 00:27:24,630
You're frickin' kidding me!!

864
00:27:24,350 --> 00:27:28,700
The five men before me, let us share in this meeting

865
00:27:28,700 --> 00:27:35,710
Today, New Years Eve in Japan, we will share this with the nation

866
00:27:28,840 --> 00:27:35,870
Giving introductions like a reporter

867
00:27:28,840 --> 00:27:35,870
The Director's Style of Greeting

868
00:27:35,940 --> 00:27:39,010
Now, I will issue a challenge to each one of you

869
00:27:37,460 --> 00:27:41,480
I will present these to you as the Director,

870
00:27:39,190 --> 00:27:43,780
and I will take your laughter from you.

871
00:27:41,700 --> 00:27:45,420
On this New Year's Eve, I want to

872
00:27:43,970 --> 00:27:45,420
aim for the pinnacle of happiness

873
00:27:45,480 --> 00:27:51,520
This was once Yamasaki Hosei,

874
00:27:48,140 --> 00:27:54,630
a man obsessed with making people laugh with his stories.

875
00:27:51,720 --> 00:27:57,330
It felt very sudden when he joined the Tsukitei group,

876
00:27:54,810 --> 00:27:59,300
today being known as Tsukitei Hosei.

877
00:27:57,560 --> 00:28:01,100
So now, putting the name of Tsukitei on the line,

878
00:27:59,500 --> 00:28:04,540
with the prestige of Japan's Rakugo society on the line,

879
00:28:01,950 --> 00:28:06,940
let's have a battle of riddles

880
00:28:04,770 --> 00:28:10,480
It's very simple. Think of the name 'Furutachi Ichiro'

881
00:28:07,120 --> 00:28:12,380
I'll repeat. Turn the name 'Furutachi Ichiro' into something funny

882
00:28:10,710 --> 00:28:12,380
Now, let's begin, storyteller

883
00:28:14,650 --> 00:28:15,950
Begin!

884
00:28:15,950 --> 00:28:19,350
When I think of Furutachi Ichiro...

885
00:28:19,430 --> 00:28:21,920
Um... The...

886
00:28:22,350 --> 00:28:26,730
He's a... Major person

887
00:28:26,730 --> 00:28:32,860
With that in mind... With Ichiro we are all Ichiro

888
00:28:32,930 --> 00:28:37,470
You threw mud all over the face of your teacher with that garbage!

889
00:28:35,020 --> 00:28:40,520
No good, that's scary, totally scary!

890
00:28:40,520 --> 00:28:44,040
Wasn't that horrible?

891
00:28:44,130 --> 00:28:45,130
That was no good

892
00:28:45,090 --> 00:28:46,530
That was ridiculous

893
00:28:51,050 --> 00:28:54,330
T/N: Karl Gotch was a professional Belgian wrestler who is known as "The God of Wrestling" in Japan due to his influence on Japanese professional wrestling.

894
00:28:51,050 --> 00:28:54,330
The soldier appears, the Karl Gotch of comedy

895
00:28:54,320 --> 00:28:59,000
A superb comedian with both talents in tsukkomi and boke, and a commentator on "Wide na Show"

896
00:28:54,320 --> 00:28:59,000
T/N: "Tsukkomi" is the comedian who retorts and reacts to the "boke" who acts stupid and says ridiculous things.

897
00:29:00,190 --> 00:29:05,100
The North Atlantic Treaty Organization of the comedy world

898
00:29:02,790 --> 00:29:06,600
Matsumoto Hitoshi makes his appearance.

899
00:29:05,300 --> 00:29:07,770
But who is this man?

900
00:29:06,780 --> 00:29:10,900
Likely out of loneliness,

901
00:29:07,970 --> 00:29:13,940
he's making a friend out of his own body,

902
00:29:11,100 --> 00:29:16,170
by building up each cell in his muscles little by little,

903
00:29:14,140 --> 00:29:20,280
creating the tough body he has now.

904
00:29:16,410 --> 00:29:23,320
That's right, behind his laugh lies a vortex of muscle

905
00:29:20,480 --> 00:29:27,020
a true culmination of his life's work.

906
00:29:23,920 --> 00:29:30,060
I've decided to give you a word puzzle.

907
00:29:27,220 --> 00:29:34,230
Let me ask you the question, and answer quickly:

908
00:29:30,260 --> 00:29:37,060
What is a new smart phone app that absolutely no one would need?

909
00:29:34,460 --> 00:29:39,230
It might be something fictional,

910
00:29:35,740 --> 00:29:37,300
This was rough

911
00:29:37,250 --> 00:29:44,200
or it might be something that already exists

912
00:29:39,010 --> 00:29:41,280
This was crazy hard

913
00:29:39,430 --> 00:29:46,940
What is a new smart phone app that absolutely no one would need?

914
00:29:44,400 --> 00:29:51,410
Now, Matsumoto, your challenge begins

915
00:29:47,170 --> 00:29:51,410
What is a new smart phone app that absolutely no one would need?

916
00:29:52,680 --> 00:29:53,710
Begin!

917
00:29:54,350 --> 00:29:56,650
A self-destruct feature

918
00:29:57,070 --> 00:29:59,550
He just yelled "self-destruct feature"

919
00:29:59,550 --> 00:30:04,020
So, the master of comedy

920
00:30:00,920 --> 00:30:04,020
bombs sometimes too, huh?

921
00:30:07,890 --> 00:30:10,130
This is impossible

922
00:30:12,470 --> 00:30:19,360
And now I will decide on the anchor

923
00:30:13,820 --> 00:30:16,460
Amazing, this is amazing

924
00:30:15,460 --> 00:30:22,700
Here we have the peerless and aggressive comedian, who plays the straight man.

925
00:30:15,460 --> 00:30:22,700
Here we have the peerless and aggressive comedian, who plays the straight man.

926
00:30:19,550 --> 00:30:26,100
This person who has been called a roadside hyena, Hamada Masatoshi.

927
00:30:22,920 --> 00:30:28,910
According to one theory, this man meets with friends night after night

928
00:30:26,270 --> 00:30:30,640
such as with people like Yonekura Ryoko, or perhaps Yanagiba Toshiro

929
00:30:29,090 --> 00:30:33,340
and Maekawa Kiyoshi.

930
00:30:30,810 --> 00:30:36,780
It was rumoured he was able to nab explosive laughter from them by doing impressions.

931
00:30:30,810 --> 00:30:36,780
It was rumoured he was able to nab explosive laughter from them by doing impressions.

932
00:30:30,810 --> 00:30:36,780
T/N: Yonekura Ryoko is an actress, Yanagiba Toshiro is an actor, and Maekawa Kiyoshi is a singer. Basically, Hamada has big-name celebrity friends.

933
00:30:32,610 --> 00:30:33,760
No, no, no

934
00:30:33,510 --> 00:30:39,680
These rumours came in via Israel's intelligence agency Mossad.

935
00:30:36,360 --> 00:30:37,360
I didn't do it

936
00:30:36,960 --> 00:30:44,050
Well then, IKKO has been getting popular again so

937
00:30:40,270 --> 00:30:44,050
let's have you challenge doing an impression of IKKO

938
00:30:42,570 --> 00:30:44,050
Come on

939
00:30:43,400 --> 00:30:45,250
Wow, how dirty

940
00:30:44,050 --> 00:30:45,790
3 2 1 Start!!

941
00:30:45,790 --> 00:30:46,820
3 2 1 Start!!

942
00:30:47,440 --> 00:30:49,760
What the hell~

943
00:30:47,440 --> 00:30:49,760
What the hell~

944
00:30:47,440 --> 00:30:49,760
What the hell~

945
00:30:47,440 --> 00:30:51,490
T/N: IKKO is a stylist/make-up artist/tv personality who is famous for saying "dondake~" while waving a finger. "Dondake~" was nominated as a buzzword in 2007. It means, "How much?!" as a surprise reaction to something of a large amount or quantity.

946
00:30:49,340 --> 00:30:50,480
How's that?

947
00:30:50,480 --> 00:30:51,490
How was that?

948
00:30:51,490 --> 00:30:53,730
Oh, I hear some laughter coming from part of the gallery

949
00:30:53,780 --> 00:30:57,500
Yes, it was definitely funny.

950
00:30:55,460 --> 00:30:57,500
But it did not reach the funny level you would call explosive

951
00:30:57,520 --> 00:31:02,170
In this strange atmosphere that has arisen,

952
00:30:59,350 --> 00:31:02,170
I wish to add some more color to this director room

953
00:31:02,240 --> 00:31:04,510
I'll show you what real impressions look like

954
00:31:04,560 --> 00:31:06,080
Come on out!!

955
00:31:06,080 --> 00:31:07,030
What? What?

956
00:31:06,730 --> 00:31:11,210
Well, well, well

957
00:31:09,080 --> 00:31:11,750
Hollywood Zakoshisyoh

958
00:31:09,080 --> 00:31:11,750
Research Institute, Researcher

959
00:31:09,080 --> 00:31:14,650
T/N: Hollywood Zakoshisyoh is a comedian who has appeared in many dramas, variety shows, radio shows, and web series. His comedian name is inspired by Hollywood Hulk Hogan.

960
00:31:11,210 --> 00:31:11,980
All right!

961
00:31:11,980 --> 00:31:14,650
No way?!

962
00:31:12,350 --> 00:31:13,850
All right!

963
00:31:15,330 --> 00:31:17,020
All right!

964
00:31:17,770 --> 00:31:19,290
Wait, seriously?!

965
00:31:17,790 --> 00:31:19,090
Whoa...

966
00:31:19,090 --> 00:31:19,920
You gotta be kidding

967
00:31:19,920 --> 00:31:21,390
All right!

968
00:31:19,920 --> 00:31:26,700
Director's style of greetings

969
00:31:19,920 --> 00:31:26,700
He will show them what a real impression looks like

970
00:31:20,610 --> 00:31:21,860
All right!

971
00:31:21,920 --> 00:31:22,870
All right!

972
00:31:22,870 --> 00:31:23,490
Right!

973
00:31:23,580 --> 00:31:24,480
Well, shall we start?

974
00:31:24,480 --> 00:31:28,210
First we'll do an overly exaggerated IKKO

975
00:31:26,700 --> 00:31:28,530
IKKO

976
00:31:26,700 --> 00:31:28,530
Overly exaggerated

977
00:31:28,860 --> 00:31:31,430
Oh-oh-oh-oh

978
00:31:31,430 --> 00:31:34,070
Oh-oh-oh-oh

979
00:31:34,240 --> 00:31:36,140
Ghooos!!

980
00:31:34,240 --> 00:31:36,140
Ghooos!!

981
00:31:34,240 --> 00:31:36,140
T/N: This is one of his signature lines.

982
00:31:36,140 --> 00:31:37,270
What on earth?

983
00:31:37,270 --> 00:31:40,360
Oh-oh-oh-oh-oh

984
00:31:40,360 --> 00:31:43,780
Oh-oh-oh-oh-oh

985
00:31:44,080 --> 00:31:45,450
Ghooos!!

986
00:31:44,080 --> 00:31:45,450
Ghooos!!

987
00:31:48,430 --> 00:31:49,940
What's that?

988
00:31:49,070 --> 00:31:50,450
What's he doing?

989
00:31:49,400 --> 00:31:50,450
Are you serious?

990
00:31:49,790 --> 00:31:51,890
Seriously

991
00:31:50,520 --> 00:31:53,320
What are you doing?

992
00:31:55,660 --> 00:31:57,890
Really, Furutachi-san, what are you doing?

993
00:31:57,210 --> 00:31:58,360
What are you doing, seriously?

994
00:31:58,560 --> 00:31:59,830
We'll move on to the next one. Next is this

995
00:31:59,830 --> 00:32:02,160
Let's go with overly exaggerated PERFECT HUMAN

996
00:31:59,830 --> 00:32:02,160
T/N: They are doing an impression of the song, "PERFECT HUMAN" by RADIO FISH, a dance/vocal unit with the same members of comedy duo, Oriental Radio.

997
00:31:59,830 --> 00:32:02,600
Overly exaggerated

998
00:31:59,830 --> 00:32:02,600
PERFECT HUMAN

999
00:32:02,600 --> 00:32:08,390
T/N: "Nakata" is the name of one of the comedians in comedy duo Oriental Radio. He actually is singing the song.

1000
00:32:02,900 --> 00:32:08,390
Na ka ta! Na ka ta! Na ka ta!

1001
00:32:08,390 --> 00:32:10,870
I'mma perrrrfect human

1002

Ghooos!!

1008
00:32:21,670 --> 00:32:23,350
What the hell?

1009
00:32:22,770 --> 00:32:27,060
Na ka ta! Na ka ta! Na ka ta!

1010
00:32:27,060 --> 00:32:28,640

Na ka ta! Na ka ta! I'm a perrrfect

1014
00:32:34,960 --> 00:32:37,200
You're the director, right?

1015
00:32:38,650 --> 00:32:39,330
human

1016
00:32:39,330 --> 00:32:40,790
Thank you very much for watching

1017
00:32:41,500 --> 00:32:44,110
Ghooos!!

1018
00:32:41,500 --> 00:32:44,110
Ghooos!!

1019
00:32:43,120 --> 00:32:44,840
You're the director, right?

1020
00:32:44,670 --> 00:32:46,270
That's right

1021
00:32:47,540 --> 00:32:49,080
After you guys take this hit

1022
00:32:51,560 --> 00:32:53,120
I expect you to keep things exciting

1023
00:32:53,120 --> 00:32:53,820
Good luck!

1024
00:32:53,820 --> 00:32:55,380
Thank you very much

1025
00:32:55,380 --> 00:32:55,830
Thank you

1026
00:32:55,830 --> 00:32:56,740
Let's go

1027
00:32:58,450 --> 00:33:01,620
Wow, that was amazing...

1028
00:32:59,920 --> 00:33:01,620
He sure was energetic

1029
00:33:01,620 --> 00:33:03,230
That director..

1030
00:33:03,230 --> 00:33:06,000
It's supposed to be archaeology, but it's really lacking in that department

1031
00:33:05,000 --> 00:33:06,000
Completely lacking

1032
00:33:06,000 --> 00:33:08,100
We all got hurt

1033
00:33:06,830 --> 00:33:08,830
Thank you very much

1034
00:33:07,510 --> 00:33:09,100
Oh no, thank you very much

1035
00:33:08,630 --> 00:33:12,940
No need to show this scene!!

1036
00:33:14,740 --> 00:33:19,580
1 hour and 30 minutes since the start

1037
00:33:17,540 --> 00:33:21,080
It's time for the curtain to rise on that segment

1038
00:33:22,890 --> 00:33:24,760
Could learn from that

1039
00:33:24,380 --> 00:33:24,850
The drawers. Shouldn't we open them?

1040
00:33:24,850 --> 00:33:27,850
The drawers. Shouldn't we open them?

1041
00:33:26,830 --> 00:33:27,850
Shall we?

1042
00:33:28,230 --> 00:33:28,980
Right

1043
00:33:29,220 --> 00:33:32,120
You said it, finally

1044
00:33:30,190 --> 00:33:31,440
It's that time

1045
00:33:31,440 --> 00:33:32,120
No, but...

1046
00:33:33,020 --> 00:33:34,990
We should think about the order in which we open

1047
00:33:34,990 --> 00:33:37,530
There's no way there's nothing inside the drawers

1048
00:33:37,660 --> 00:33:40,930
Hamada, let's start from you

1049
00:33:38,790 --> 00:33:39,860
What?

1050
00:33:39,860 --> 00:33:40,930
Seriously?

1051
00:33:40,930 --> 00:33:47,270
This year's top batter is Hamada

1052
00:33:45,880 --> 00:33:47,270
How about starting from the top?

1053
00:33:47,440 --> 00:33:50,040
There are times when it gets scary

1054
00:33:48,220 --> 00:33:51,340
True, there's probably a pattern there. Quite traumatic

1055
00:33:51,340 --> 00:33:52,710
Ahh, there's stuff inside!!

1056
00:33:52,410 --> 00:33:54,630
Look, there's something in there right off the bat

1057
00:33:56,130 --> 00:33:57,600
Looks like some kind of ancient paper

1058
00:33:56,950 --> 00:34:01,080
Mysterious ancient manuscript and key

1059
00:33:57,600 --> 00:34:01,080
What, what?

1060
00:33:57,600 --> 00:34:01,080
Whoa, whoa

1061
00:34:01,080 --> 00:34:03,470
Seems it's only this paper and there's something written on it

1062
00:34:02,070 --> 00:34:03,670
What's this?

1063
00:34:03,670 --> 00:34:12,660
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

1064
00:34:04,070 --> 00:34:12,660
After opening the wall of heroes with the antique key

1065
00:34:08,820 --> 00:34:12,660
and proving your brave spirit via the devil's mouth

1066
00:34:12,660 --> 00:34:22,510
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

1067
00:34:12,690 --> 00:34:22,510
A strong golden fortune will come to dwell within you

1068
00:34:16,350 --> 00:34:22,510
The keyhole lies beneath the Goddess statue

1069
00:34:18,370 --> 00:34:20,040
It's using rather difficult expressions

1070
00:34:20,120 --> 00:34:21,750
"Strong golden fortune"...

1071
00:34:21,270 --> 00:34:22,300
I think that's it

1072
00:34:22,150 --> 00:34:22,510
Hamada-san...

1073
00:34:22,510 --> 00:34:24,190
Oh!

1074
00:34:22,510 --> 00:34:26,280
-----------

1075
00:34:22,510 --> 00:34:26,280
Goddess statue

1076
00:34:24,190 --> 00:34:25,190
Is that it?

1077
00:34:26,280 --> 00:34:30,850
"A strong golden fortune will come to dwell within you"

1078
00:34:28,580 --> 00:34:30,850
What does that mean?

1079
00:34:29,110 --> 00:34:30,300
"A strong golden fortune will come to dwell"...

1080
00:34:30,300 --> 00:34:32,260
Huh? It's this one right?

1081
00:34:32,260 --> 00:34:33,680
Yes

1082
00:34:33,680 --> 00:34:35,850
Whaaaa!!

1083
00:34:35,850 --> 00:34:37,920
Urgh, it's scary!!

1084
00:34:36,850 --> 00:34:37,920
Scary

1085
00:34:38,800 --> 00:34:40,120
It's scary

1086
00:34:42,760 --> 00:34:43,530
Huh?

1087
00:34:55,270 --> 00:34:56,790
The Mouth of Truth

1088
00:34:57,670 --> 00:35:00,540
That's a "Mouth of Truth"

1089
00:35:00,540 --> 00:35:04,450
"Prove your brave spirit via the devil's mouth.
A strong golden fortune will come to dwell within you"

1090
00:35:04,710 --> 00:35:06,950
It's "your brave spirit"!!

1091
00:35:06,950 --> 00:35:10,120
Oh! You're supposed to put your hand inside that?

1092
00:35:07,500 --> 00:35:08,250
Yeah

1093
00:35:08,370 --> 00:35:09,280
So that's how it is

1094
00:35:09,000 --> 00:35:10,120
Scary!

1095
00:35:10,120 --> 00:35:13,190
However, only Hamada can do it

1096
00:35:11,650 --> 00:35:12,350
Yes

1097
00:35:12,090 --> 00:35:13,190
That's right

1098
00:35:14,290 --> 00:35:15,160
What!! Why is this first?

1099
00:35:15,160 --> 00:35:17,430
What!! Why is this first?

1100
00:35:15,820 --> 00:35:17,430
Scary, scary...

1101
00:35:18,030 --> 00:35:19,830
A strong golden fortune will dwell within you

1102
00:35:20,530 --> 00:35:20,860
What if I get an electric shock or something like that...?

1103
00:35:20,860 --> 00:35:21,300
What if I get an electric shock or something like that...?

1104
00:35:21,300 --> 00:35:24,130
What if I get an electric shock or something like that...?

1105
00:35:24,130 --> 00:35:26,820
I don't think there will be such childish tricks

1106
00:35:26,820 --> 00:35:28,600
like electric shocks given this elaborate set-up

1107
00:35:28,600 --> 00:35:30,740
Really?

1108
00:35:28,950 --> 00:35:29,820
Yeah

1109
00:35:30,690 --> 00:35:32,240
You just have to do it

1110
00:35:31,690 --> 00:35:32,540
Right, you just have to do it

1111
00:35:32,240 --> 00:35:35,650
Ahh... This is scary

1112
00:35:32,720 --> 00:35:34,530
It's scary

1113
00:35:34,530 --> 00:35:36,530
This is seriously scary

1114
00:35:38,580 --> 00:35:38,780
Scary

1115
00:35:38,780 --> 00:35:38,980
Scary

1116
00:35:38,980 --> 00:35:39,250
Scary

1117
00:35:39,250 --> 00:35:39,450
Scary

1118
00:35:39,450 --> 00:35:39,580
Scary

1119
00:35:39,580 --> 00:35:41,020
Scary, scary

1120
00:35:39,580 --> 00:35:41,020
What should I do!!

1121
00:35:41,020 --> 00:35:42,030
Do you hear a "sa sa sa" kind of sound?

1122
00:35:42,030 --> 00:35:45,420
Is it his hand making that sound?

1123
00:35:42,030 --> 00:35:45,420
Near the Mouth of Truth

1124
00:35:47,140 --> 00:35:48,870
Wah, wah, his hand went in

1125
00:35:48,460 --> 00:35:49,930
What's this?

1126
00:35:49,930 --> 00:35:51,090
Wait, what's this?

1127
00:35:53,530 --> 00:35:55,660
I can feel a liquid flowing

1128
00:35:56,100 --> 00:35:59,270
A mysterious liquid is on his hand

1129
00:35:56,100 --> 00:35:59,270
Liquid is flowing?

1130
00:35:57,820 --> 00:35:59,100
What is this?

1131
00:35:59,670 --> 00:36:01,500
Take your hand out

1132
00:36:02,370 --> 00:36:03,370
Some kind of liquid?

1133
00:36:04,340 --> 00:36:06,440
Something's on my hand but what is it?

1134
00:36:07,790 --> 00:36:10,050
Urgh it smells!!

1135
00:36:10,410 --> 00:36:11,780
It smells so badly!

1136
00:36:13,430 --> 00:36:13,600
It smells!!

1137
00:36:13,600 --> 00:36:15,720
It smells!!

1138
00:36:17,440 --> 00:36:17,570
Ah, so smelly!!

1139
00:36:17,570 --> 00:36:19,090
Ah, so smelly!!

1140
00:36:20,590 --> 00:36:20,920
Really stinky!!

1141
00:36:20,920 --> 00:36:22,090
Really stinky!!

1142
00:36:23,360 --> 00:36:24,860
What do you mean by smelly?

1143
00:36:24,860 --> 00:36:26,900
It really smells

1144
00:36:25,610 --> 00:36:27,260
What? What?

1145
00:36:27,880 --> 00:36:29,050
What the hell?

1146
00:36:31,380 --> 00:36:32,340
It really is quite smelly

1147
00:36:32,340 --> 00:36:34,870
What's that smell?

1148
00:36:34,070 --> 00:36:36,190
But Matsumoto-san, we don't know what smell it is

1149
00:36:36,190 --> 00:36:37,710
It's certainly smelly though

1150
00:36:37,710 --> 00:36:39,510
What's that smell?

1151
00:36:41,080 --> 00:36:43,750
It stinks!!

1152
00:36:47,700 --> 00:36:48,920
What kind of smell is this?

1153
00:36:48,650 --> 00:36:49,830
What's this?

1154
00:36:49,620 --> 00:36:51,190
It smells

1155
00:36:49,620 --> 00:36:51,190
It's like, well...

1156
00:36:51,450 --> 00:36:52,620
It can't be a smell from the crotch area, right?

1157
00:36:52,620 --> 00:36:56,090
It can't be a smell from the crotch area, right?

1158
00:36:54,940 --> 00:36:55,920
What is it then?

1159
00:36:56,960 --> 00:36:59,910
I think, perhaps, it might be...

1160
00:37:00,360 --> 00:37:03,400
Isn't it poop?

1161
00:37:01,250 --> 00:37:03,400
Pfft!!

1162
00:37:05,330 --> 00:37:08,000
No, I don't think that's right?

1163
00:37:08,000 --> 00:37:09,090
But

1164
00:37:08,540 --> 00:37:09,600
It's true!

1165
00:37:14,640 --> 00:37:16,780
Right, I get it

1166
00:37:15,780 --> 00:37:16,780
Yeah

1167
00:37:16,780 --> 00:37:20,650
It's "A strong golden fortune" so... It's the smell of poop

1168
00:37:16,800 --> 00:37:20,650
It's "A strong golden fortune" so... It's the smell of poop

1169
00:37:16,800 --> 00:37:20,650
T/N: The Japanese word for fortune is "un" while the word for poop is "unko". So this is a play on words.

1170
00:37:20,650 --> 00:37:23,920
The smell of poop now dwells on Hamada

1171
00:37:25,940 --> 00:37:26,820
Horrible

1172
00:37:27,870 --> 00:37:29,210
T-There's poop on that hand right?

1173
00:37:30,290 --> 00:37:32,210
I really hate this

1174
00:37:33,090 --> 00:37:34,560
What on earth are they doing?

1175
00:37:34,660 --> 00:37:38,400
There's poop on Hamada-san's hand

1176
00:37:36,680 --> 00:37:38,400
That's a bad way of phrasing things

1177
00:37:38,400 --> 00:37:40,390
This is horrible, really

1178
00:37:40,390 --> 00:37:42,740
Really

1179
00:37:41,020 --> 00:37:42,740
smelly!!

1180
00:37:42,740 --> 00:37:44,340
I want to wipe it off, I want to wipe it off...

1181
00:37:43,100 --> 00:37:45,460
This is bad. You should go wash it off

1182
00:37:44,810 --> 00:37:45,710
It smells!

1183
00:37:45,710 --> 00:37:48,380
There's... Um...

1184
00:37:47,340 --> 00:37:49,880
Air freshener!!

1185
00:37:48,380 --> 00:37:50,080
That's right, there's air freshener

1186
00:37:49,880 --> 00:37:50,620
Oh, I see

1187
00:37:50,650 --> 00:37:52,620
Once I wipe my hand, spray this

1188
00:37:52,000 --> 00:37:53,470
That's...

1189
00:37:54,580 --> 00:37:57,350
Spray that hand of his that's holding poop...

1190
00:37:57,820 --> 00:38:00,460
I'm not holding poop

1191
00:38:00,510 --> 00:38:02,530
What are you doing, spraying so much...

1192
00:38:02,720 --> 00:38:03,960
He used the air freshener to drench my hand...

1193
00:38:03,960 --> 00:38:06,160
He used the air freshener to drench my hand...

1194
00:38:06,160 --> 00:38:08,870
Hamada, it's because you smell of poop

1195
00:38:07,310 --> 00:38:08,870
No, no, no

1196
00:38:09,160 --> 00:38:12,370
This is the worst

1197
00:38:11,220 --> 00:38:12,800
How is it now?

1198
00:38:12,370 --> 00:38:15,570
He's sprayed my hand so I'm going to wipe it now

1199
00:38:15,570 --> 00:38:19,240
Someone open their drawers next

1200
00:38:18,360 --> 00:38:20,640
Whaaat?

1201
00:38:20,640 --> 00:38:22,680
This is really messed up

1202
00:38:21,680 --> 00:38:22,940
Yeah, it's quite messed up

1203
00:38:22,950 --> 00:38:26,350
It was actually poop

1204
00:38:24,560 --> 00:38:26,350
Using poop on New Year's eve...

1205
00:38:26,350 --> 00:38:27,780
Using tricks like that...

1206
00:38:27,850 --> 00:38:28,830
That's a bit much

1207
00:38:28,380 --> 00:38:29,920
Shall I go next?

1208
00:38:28,820 --> 00:38:29,720
Go on

1209
00:38:29,720 --> 00:38:30,890
I'll start opening

1210
00:38:31,590 --> 00:38:33,790
Aren't you going to do PERFECT HUMAN?

1211
00:38:32,490 --> 00:38:33,790
No, it's fine

1212
00:38:38,060 --> 00:38:38,660
Oh?

1213
00:38:40,700 --> 00:38:41,430
Hey

1214
00:38:41,100 --> 00:38:42,160
Something's gonna appear

1215
00:38:41,880 --> 00:38:43,080
Scary

1216
00:38:44,580 --> 00:38:45,120
There's something!

1217
00:38:45,100 --> 00:38:49,470
Mysterious DVD

1218
00:38:45,130 --> 00:38:46,470
It's appeared!

1219
00:38:46,470 --> 00:38:47,340
DVD?

1220
00:38:47,340 --> 00:38:48,770
A DVD over in Endo's drawers...

1221
00:38:48,070 --> 00:38:49,070
Tanaka usually gets the DVDs right?

1222
00:38:49,470 --> 00:38:52,480
My drawers only had this

1223
00:38:49,950 --> 00:38:52,480
Whaat?

1224
00:38:52,610 --> 00:38:57,250
The DVDs always led to Thai Kicks for me, but it might happen to Endo this time

1225
00:38:55,310 --> 00:39:01,880
9 years in a row, DVDs gave him

1226
00:38:55,310 --> 00:39:01,880
Airport

1227
00:38:55,310 --> 00:39:01,880
Detective

1228
00:38:55,310 --> 00:39:01,880
EDF

1229
00:38:55,310 --> 00:39:01,880
Hotel

1230
00:38:55,310 --> 00:39:01,880
Police

1231
00:38:55,310 --> 00:39:01,880
Prison

1232
00:38:55,310 --> 00:39:01,880
Scientist

1233
00:38:55,310 --> 00:39:01,880
Spy

1234
00:38:55,310 --> 00:39:01,880
Teacher

1235
00:38:55,310 --> 00:39:01,880
Thai Kicks

1236
00:38:57,810 --> 00:38:59,530
Isn't it better if you do your impression of PERFECT HUMAN?

1237
00:38:59,530 --> 00:39:01,270
No, I won't do PERFECT HUMAN

1238
00:39:01,880 --> 00:39:04,020
What are we doing about that? Or should we take a look at Tanaka's drawers?

1239
00:39:04,150 --> 00:39:05,820
Having DVDs in his drawers isn't impossible

1240
00:39:05,820 --> 00:39:07,560
Having DVDs in his drawers isn't impossible

1241
00:39:07,320 --> 00:39:09,730
That's right, because that's how it is

1242
00:39:09,310 --> 00:39:10,690
Seems complicated

1243
00:39:09,860 --> 00:39:11,890
I'll just take a look

1244
00:39:10,700 --> 00:39:11,890
I'll open my drawers

1245
00:39:11,890 --> 00:39:15,100
Perhaps there will be different things in his drawers

1246
00:39:13,140 --> 00:39:16,610
If there's no DVD, that brings up a lot of questions, but if there is a DVD, then that's also...

1247
00:39:16,620 --> 00:39:16,780
Ahh!!

1248
00:39:16,780 --> 00:39:18,270
Ahh!!

1249
00:39:17,570 --> 00:39:18,950
It's here

1250
00:39:18,950 --> 00:39:21,090
DVD!

1251
00:39:18,950 --> 00:39:22,240
Whoa, whoa!

1252
00:39:19,970 --> 00:39:24,670
Mysterious DVD

1253
00:39:21,090 --> 00:39:22,240
There was a DVD inside

1254
00:39:22,240 --> 00:39:24,670
But there's no numbers or anything so

1255
00:39:24,670 --> 00:39:27,210
The DVDs are not in order, right?

1256
00:39:25,010 --> 00:39:26,740
It doesn't matter which goes first

1257
00:39:25,160 --> 00:39:27,060
Right, right

1258
00:39:27,210 --> 00:39:29,080
What does it mean?

1259
00:39:28,060 --> 00:39:29,650
They might not be related

1260
00:39:30,310 --> 00:39:31,700
Whoa!

1261
00:39:30,550 --> 00:39:31,700
Huh?!

1262
00:39:31,700 --> 00:39:33,980
A letter...

1263
00:39:32,850 --> 00:39:37,090
Mysterious envelope

1264
00:39:32,980 --> 00:39:34,430
Wow, it's thick

1265
00:39:33,650 --> 00:39:36,100
Seems here's quite a number of things inside

1266
00:39:34,430 --> 00:39:36,100
Yeah, looks like there's a lot of things inside

1267
00:39:36,100 --> 00:39:37,870
Huh? No way!

1268
00:39:38,020 --> 00:39:39,060
Oh, there's nothing in here

1269
00:39:39,060 --> 00:39:42,360
Why's this empty!!

1270
00:39:45,660 --> 00:39:49,370
He just laughed

1271
00:39:47,030 --> 00:39:48,280
I didn't laugh!

1272
00:39:48,280 --> 00:39:49,370
Every time...

1273
00:39:49,370 --> 00:39:52,440
Wait, what are we gonna now?

1274
00:39:50,400 --> 00:39:51,130
Yeah, really

1275
00:39:51,130 --> 00:39:51,830
That's amazing

1276
00:39:51,830 --> 00:39:54,870
Wait, just... What should we do with these, I wonder?

1277
00:39:51,830 --> 00:39:54,870
What should we do?

1278
00:39:54,870 --> 00:39:55,510
Endo, isn't it better if you do your PERFECT HUMAN
-----------------Linebreak-----------------------------------------------------
impression now?

1279
00:39:55,510 --> 00:39:57,740
Endo, isn't it better if you do your PERFECT HUMAN
-----------------Linebreak-----------------------------------------------------
impression now?

1280
00:39:57,020 --> 00:39:58,240
For the moment

1281
00:39:58,240 --> 00:40:02,480
PERFECT HUMAN...

1282
00:39:59,890 --> 00:40:02,480
Seriously, seriously

1283
00:40:05,280 --> 00:40:09,370
3 2 1 Go!!

1284
00:40:09,370 --> 00:40:12,690
Na ka ta! Na ka ta! Perfect Human!

1285
00:40:12,690 --> 00:40:13,960
GHOOIIIS!!

1286
00:40:21,300 --> 00:40:22,500
It's weird that I get an "OUT"

1287
00:40:23,050 --> 00:40:24,600
I definitely shouldn't be out

1288
00:40:26,610 --> 00:40:28,460
Your laugh is different than that

1289
00:40:27,670 --> 00:40:28,070
Yes

1290
00:40:28,470 --> 00:40:29,970
That's not how I laugh...

1291
00:40:29,980 --> 00:40:32,040
That was a permissible laugh

1292
00:40:33,100 --> 00:40:34,820
It wasn't a laugh, more like smiling from embarrassment

1293
00:40:34,820 --> 00:40:37,580
Shall we go from Endo?

1294
00:40:36,000 --> 00:40:37,580
Yes, one by one

1295
00:40:36,340 --> 00:40:36,980
Sure

1296
00:40:37,250 --> 00:40:37,580
Right

1297
00:40:37,670 --> 00:40:39,050
We'll go in order

1298
00:40:39,200 --> 00:40:40,700
There will be too many items

1299
00:40:40,170 --> 00:40:42,200
Wait, either way

1300
00:40:40,770 --> 00:40:41,150
Yeah

1301
00:40:41,530 --> 00:40:43,550
There really are a lot

1302
00:40:42,250 --> 00:40:43,840
I'm not sure how to break it up

1303
00:40:42,750 --> 00:40:43,560
Oooh no

1304
00:40:43,850 --> 00:40:45,520
No no no, it's DVD, oh no

1305
00:40:46,120 --> 00:40:48,100
Right? It used to be magazines

1306
00:40:48,020 --> 00:40:48,650
Right?

1307
00:40:48,870 --> 00:40:49,420
Yeah...

1308
00:40:50,690 --> 00:40:54,340
I'm scared...

1309
00:40:52,020 --> 00:40:54,340
Thai kicks are the worst...

1310
00:40:54,820 --> 00:40:56,550
Appearance OK Derby

1311
00:40:57,800 --> 00:40:59,000
We had this last year too

1312
00:40:59,120 --> 00:41:05,140
Will celebrities dress up and perform for us?

1313
00:41:05,900 --> 00:41:09,870
Their reactions will be recorded by hidden cameras

1314
00:41:07,180 --> 00:41:10,580
Their reactions will be recorded by hidden cameras

1315
00:41:11,270 --> 00:41:13,150
Who will they dress up as!?

1316
00:41:13,530 --> 00:41:18,450
Yancy & Mariconne

1317
00:41:13,530 --> 00:41:18,450
T/N: Yancy and Mariconne are comedians who are known for their dancing and guitar-based skits.

1318
00:41:16,700 --> 00:41:18,120
Here's the bit they'll perform

1319
00:41:18,620 --> 00:41:19,970
Ready?

1320
00:41:18,850 --> 00:41:24,450
Limbo dance under the guitar challenge

1321
00:41:19,970 --> 00:41:20,420
Look

1322
00:41:20,050 --> 00:41:21,070
1, 2, 3

1323
00:41:20,820 --> 00:41:21,200
Yes

1324
00:41:21,070 --> 00:41:21,700
LIMBO!!

1325
00:41:21,070 --> 00:41:21,700
LIMBO!!

1326
00:41:21,700 --> 00:41:22,470
That's bad

1327
00:41:24,000 --> 00:41:24,670
LIMBO!!

1328
00:41:24,000 --> 00:41:24,670
LIMBO!!

1329
00:41:27,430 --> 00:41:32,130
The guitar hit her breasts, so she's mad

1330
00:41:32,140 --> 00:41:33,670
You touch my 'oob!

1331
00:41:32,140 --> 00:41:38,670
T/N: Their skit is a combination of English and Japanese. "Oppai" is Japanese for "boobs" and "pai" is the shortened version. They are not saying, "You touch my pie."

1332
00:41:33,680 --> 00:41:35,070
You touch my 'oob!

1333
00:41:35,070 --> 00:41:36,500
No touch your 'oob!

1334
00:41:36,500 --> 00:41:37,940
No touch your 'oob!

1335
00:41:37,940 --> 00:41:38,670
You touch 'oob!

1336
00:41:38,670 --> 00:41:39,380
No touch 'oob!

1337
00:41:39,380 --> 00:41:40,110
You touch 'oob!

1338
00:41:40,120 --> 00:41:40,810
No touch 'oob!

1340
00:41:41,540 --> 00:41:42,250
No touch 'oob!

1341
00:41:42,250 --> 00:41:43,250
You touch my 'oob!

1342
00:41:43,270 --> 00:41:45,580

Will be playing the role of Mariconne

1345
00:41:46,120 --> 00:41:48,070
After seeing the rhythmic limbo dance

1346
00:41:47,940 --> 00:41:50,020
They'll really do this?

1347
00:41:48,150 --> 00:41:50,250
We will have them play the role of Mariconne

1348
00:41:51,030 --> 00:41:55,070
Three celebrities have entered the race!

1349
00:41:51,900 --> 00:41:55,020
Three celebrities have entered this race!

1350
00:41:55,020 --> 00:41:59,960
Who will consent to this performance!?

1351
00:41:55,900 --> 00:41:58,700
So, who will consent to this performance?

1352
00:41:58,700 --> 00:41:59,770
Who will it be?

1353
00:41:59,960 --> 00:42:00,950
Welcome

1354
00:42:00,950 --> 00:42:02,220

1355
00:42:02,000 --> 00:42:03,570
Thank you for coming

1356
00:42:03,120 --> 00:42:04,570
Thanks for having me

1357
00:42:05,870 --> 00:42:06,700

1358
00:42:07,470 --> 00:42:08,570
Thank you

1363
00:42:12,770 --> 00:42:14,570
In 1990

1364

She debuted wielding her F-cup bust

1365
00:42:14,670 --> 00:42:16,980
F-cup

1366
00:42:14,670 --> 00:42:16,980
bust

1367
00:42:17,430 --> 00:42:22,050
A big boob idol originator

1368
00:42:17,450 --> 00:42:19,020
As an originator of big boob idols

1369
00:42:19,150 --> 00:42:21,020
She led the world of gravure

1370
00:42:19,300 --> 00:42:20,500
Right right right

1371
00:42:21,200 --> 00:42:24,650
The number of times her photos have been published-

1372
00:42:22,200 --> 00:42:26,660
Her published photos number over 1 million!

1373
00:42:24,850 --> 00:42:26,670
is over 1 million!

1374
00:42:26,800 --> 00:42:29,220
Even now, she has an impeccable figure

1375
00:42:26,830 --> 00:42:32,520
Fumie Hosokawa's appearance negotiation!

1376
00:42:29,520 --> 00:42:32,170
We will negotiate her appearance!

1377
00:42:32,610 --> 00:42:37,700
Have you ever worked with Downtown?

1378
00:42:36,150 --> 00:42:37,350
Yes, I think so

1379
00:42:36,600 --> 00:42:38,070
Looks like she's gotten thinner

1380
00:42:37,710 --> 00:42:41,670
What are your thoughts on Tsukitei Hosei?

1381
00:42:40,450 --> 00:42:41,570
Hosei is-

1382
00:42:41,680 --> 00:42:46,840
Since he was in a duo with Hiromitsu Noriyasu,

1383
00:42:42,850 --> 00:42:44,170
Yes yes yes

1384
00:42:44,550 --> 00:42:46,170
Fumie remembers very well

1385
00:42:46,350 --> 00:42:47,020
Yeah

1386
00:42:47,350 --> 00:42:49,020
While he was on the radio for Young Town,

1387
00:42:48,350 --> 00:42:50,000
Oh, that's right

1388
00:42:49,020 --> 00:42:50,780
While he was on the radio for Young Town,

1389
00:42:50,780 --> 00:42:54,450
There was a time he took care of me

1390
00:42:55,330 --> 00:42:56,920
When I was young, Noriyasu-san was my crush

1391
00:42:56,920 --> 00:42:59,060
When I was young, Noriyasu-san was my crush

1392
00:42:59,060 --> 00:43:04,030
When I was young, Noriyasu-san was my crush

1393
00:43:05,570 --> 00:43:06,220
Eh?

1394
00:43:07,370 --> 00:43:08,850
What made you laugh?

1395
00:43:09,070 --> 00:43:12,070
The lady beside her...

1396
00:43:11,370 --> 00:43:12,320
Watch her

1397
00:43:13,320 --> 00:43:14,370
I saw her too

1398
00:43:14,380 --> 00:43:16,910
I blocked her so I wouldn't look

1399
00:43:16,120 --> 00:43:16,910
You get it

1400
00:43:17,280 --> 00:43:19,480
The manager-looking lady?

1401
00:43:18,520 --> 00:43:18,900
Yes

1402
00:43:19,820 --> 00:43:27,750
Look
Here

1403
00:43:19,820 --> 00:43:27,750
m 1 0 l 150 0 150 75 0 75

1404
00:43:20,580 --> 00:43:22,050

1405
00:43:22,050 --> 00:43:24,190
When I was young, Noriyasu-san was my crush

1406
00:43:24,190 --> 00:43:27,750
When I was young, Noriyasu-san was my crush

1407
00:43:32,270 --> 00:43:34,520
No no no no

1408
00:43:34,100 --> 00:43:34,920
No way

1409
00:43:35,310 --> 00:43:38,430
I saw it by accident...

1410
00:43:36,520 --> 00:43:37,870
That's no good, seriously...

1411
00:43:38,450 --> 00:43:39,920
She was probably...

1412
00:43:39,270 --> 00:43:40,000
Come on

1413
00:43:40,000 --> 00:43:40,720
She was surprised

1414
00:43:40,740 --> 00:43:43,270
You don't have to say that!!

1415
00:43:41,570 --> 00:43:44,400
Yes, please don't do that

1416
00:43:43,270 --> 00:43:45,650
"Why are you laughing?" was your question

1417
00:43:46,780 --> 00:43:48,240
When I was young, Noriyasu-san was my crush

1418
00:43:47,920 --> 00:43:49,920
How many times are we
going to watch this?

1419
00:43:48,240 --> 00:43:50,380
When I was young, Noriyasu-san was my crush

1420
00:43:50,380 --> 00:43:54,440
When I was young, Noriyasu-san was my crush

1421
00:43:59,170 --> 00:43:59,740
This

1422
00:43:59,780 --> 00:44:01,880
Has nothing to do with anything at all!

1423
00:44:05,500 --> 00:44:07,000
Completely unrelated

1424
00:44:06,670 --> 00:44:07,770
Unrelated, right?

1425
00:44:07,270 --> 00:44:08,470
Well, that's

1426
00:44:07,830 --> 00:44:11,130
The focus is wrong!!

1427
00:44:09,700 --> 00:44:11,000
Oh come on

1428
00:44:11,250 --> 00:44:12,100
Moving on

1429
00:44:11,470 --> 00:44:14,470
Now the question we've been wanting to ask

1430
00:44:12,500 --> 00:44:13,920
Now the question we've been wanting to ask

1431
00:44:15,000 --> 00:44:18,010
Hosokawa, as an assassin of laughter, would you

1432
00:44:18,010 --> 00:44:23,210
Please dress up and perform for us?

1433
00:44:23,210 --> 00:44:28,370
I love it! Doing that stuff!!

1434
00:44:34,420 --> 00:44:36,150
Cut that out of the frame!!

1435
00:44:34,900 --> 00:44:36,620
Cut it out!

1436
00:44:36,620 --> 00:44:38,190
No!

1437
00:44:36,930 --> 00:44:37,660
Put a paper over that half!!

1438
00:44:37,660 --> 00:44:38,850
Put a paper over that half!!

1439
00:44:39,550 --> 00:44:40,670
Cover it with paper

1440
00:44:41,950 --> 00:44:43,800
Give me a break already

1441
00:44:43,350 --> 00:44:44,800
Why would you even film her?

1442
00:44:44,800 --> 00:44:45,490
Just

1443
00:44:45,490 --> 00:44:48,530
(The monitor) Cover it with paper, please!!

1444
00:44:47,320 --> 00:44:49,800
We don't need to see all of her reactions!

1445
00:44:48,670 --> 00:44:49,270
Ahh

1446
00:44:50,010 --> 00:44:53,600
It's all Hamada's fault for pointing it out in the first place,




if he hadn't we wouldn't be out

1447
00:44:52,720 --> 00:44:53,650
That's right

1448
00:44:54,100 --> 00:44:57,270
The part you'd be playing is this...

1449
00:44:57,270 --> 00:44:58,670
You touch 'oob!

1450
00:44:58,000 --> 00:44:59,380
No touch 'oob!

1451
00:44:58,680 --> 00:45:00,180
You touch 'oob!

1452
00:44:59,390 --> 00:45:00,780
No touch 'oob!

1453
00:45:00,200 --> 00:45:01,480
You touch 'oob!

1454
00:45:00,800 --> 00:45:01,480
No touch 'oob!

1455
00:45:01,500 --> 00:45:03,750

Her boobs end up hitting it

00:50:56,960 --> 00:50:58,400
You touched my 'oob

You touch my 'oob!

00:50:59,740 --> 00:51:02,680

1713
00:51:12,580 --> 00:51:14,660
Amazing...

1714
00:51:15,020 --> 00:51:15,860
'oob 'oob 'oob

1715
00:51:15,020 --> 00:51:15,860
'oob 'oob 'oob

1716
00:51:15,860 --> 00:51:16,630
Boing boing boing

1717
00:51:15,860 --> 00:51:16,630
Boing boing boing

1718
00:51:16,630 --> 00:51:17,790
Boom boom boom boom

1719
00:51:16,630 --> 00:51:17,790
Boom boom boom boom

1720
00:51:16,950 --> 00:51:18,700
They sure practiced this

1721
00:51:18,050 --> 00:51:25,070
'oob 'oob 'oob 'oob boing boing boing boing boom boom boom boom

1722
00:51:18,050 --> 00:51:25,070
'oob 'oob 'oob 'oob boing boing boing boing boom boom boom boom

1723
00:51:21,230 --> 00:51:25,070

1724
00:51:21,230 --> 00:51:25,070
'oob 'oob 'oob 'oob boing boing boing boing boom boom boom boom

1725
00:51:27,100 --> 00:51:29,840
It was all of them

1726
00:51:31,280 --> 00:51:34,300
I don't think anyone would've guessed it right

1727
00:51:34,300 --> 00:51:35,650
Not for sure, man...

1728
00:51:39,070 --> 00:51:42,640
We've had the Appearance OK Derby since last year

1729
00:51:40,810 --> 00:51:42,640
We have, we have

1730
00:51:43,010 --> 00:51:45,050
Matsumoto still hasn't checked

1731
00:51:45,050 --> 00:51:46,380
Either Tanaka deals with his first or Matsumoto checks his drawer

1732
00:51:46,380 --> 00:51:50,080
Either Tanaka deals with his first or Matsumoto checks his drawer

1733
00:51:50,080 --> 00:51:51,090
How about it?

1734
00:51:51,090 --> 00:51:52,620
Shall I open the drawers?

1735
00:51:52,890 --> 00:51:54,860
There are two left though

1736
00:51:57,220 --> 00:51:58,090
There's nothing inside

1737
00:52:03,000 --> 00:52:03,860
There's nothing inside...

1738
00:52:03,860 --> 00:52:04,620
Really?

1739
00:52:04,380 --> 00:52:05,330
Both?

1740
00:52:04,970 --> 00:52:06,030
This one's the last

1741
00:52:06,030 --> 00:52:07,690
Then it's got to be that one

1742
00:52:08,040 --> 00:52:10,040
Ahh...

1743
00:52:08,800 --> 00:52:09,740
Of course, there it is

1744
00:52:11,300 --> 00:52:13,500
There's no way there's nothing

1745
00:52:13,540 --> 00:52:16,280
There's quite a lot in there

1746
00:52:16,280 --> 00:52:18,260
This looks complicated

1747
00:52:17,780 --> 00:52:19,500
Yes, it does

1748
00:52:20,010 --> 00:52:22,460
It looks kind of difficult doesn't it?

1749
00:52:23,280 --> 00:52:25,220
Ugh, what is this?

1750
00:52:25,220 --> 00:52:27,690
First off, this

1751
00:52:27,690 --> 00:52:29,260
A switch

1752
00:52:29,760 --> 00:52:31,360
And then this

1753
00:52:33,040 --> 00:52:34,090
Glasses

1754
00:52:35,230 --> 00:52:37,260
What is this... Bobbed hair

1755
00:52:37,900 --> 00:52:39,370
A bobbed hair wig

1756
00:52:42,040 --> 00:52:42,640
A letter

1757
00:52:42,800 --> 00:52:45,270
A letter

1758
00:52:46,840 --> 00:52:51,760
T/N: Hyokkorihan is a comedian whose gag is to do a peek-a-boo style joke where he hides his face behind something to the timing of his song and then reveals his face.

1759
00:52:46,840 --> 00:53:12,400
Hyokkorihan Set

1760
00:52:51,760 --> 00:52:59,120
This is a funny set that will

1761
00:52:53,100 --> 00:52:59,120
allow you to become Hyokkorihan

1762
00:52:56,380 --> 00:52:58,250
Ah, you're so lucky

1763
00:52:59,400 --> 00:53:03,220
There are 3 options: one time, three times, and seven times

1764
00:53:03,210 --> 00:53:12,400
It will not stop until the person using the set will make people within the room laugh.

1765
00:53:03,210 --> 00:53:12,400
It will not stop until the person using the set will make people within the room laugh.

1766
00:53:08,200 --> 00:53:09,450
This is hell

1767
00:53:09,780 --> 00:53:12,400
Eh? I have to do this? Me?

1768
00:53:12,400 --> 00:53:14,570
Of course

1769
00:53:12,400 --> 00:53:14,570
Yes

1770
00:53:14,570 --> 00:53:18,060
But if we laugh it'll be over right away

1771
00:53:18,060 --> 00:53:18,640
If you skillfully make us snicker

1772
00:53:18,640 --> 00:53:19,170
If you skillfully make us snicker

1773
00:53:18,640 --> 00:53:19,170
snicker

1774
00:53:19,170 --> 00:53:20,810
If you skillfully make us snicker

1775
00:53:21,480 --> 00:53:23,940
Because we're allies after all

1776
00:53:23,940 --> 00:53:26,380
There isn't a good place to do this though

1777
00:53:25,900 --> 00:53:26,820
Yeah

1778
00:53:26,380 --> 00:53:28,550
I guess over there is fine

1779
00:53:29,250 --> 00:53:31,090
Please make a decision

1780
00:53:31,270 --> 00:53:34,390
Facing back and then turning towards us or anything works

1781
00:53:34,560 --> 00:53:36,020
I'll do it outside then

1782
00:53:36,290 --> 00:53:37,060
Endo can you push the one time button?

1783
00:53:37,060 --> 00:53:40,490
Endo can you push the one time button?

1784
00:53:38,640 --> 00:53:40,490
Sure. Just the one time?

1785
00:53:40,490 --> 00:53:41,860
Yeah, will you push the one time button?

1786
00:53:41,750 --> 00:53:42,780
Alright, got it

1787
00:53:43,150 --> 00:53:45,150
The first attempt is important

1788
00:53:45,430 --> 00:53:48,200
The first attempt is important, yeah?

1789
00:53:46,970 --> 00:53:48,200
The freshness

1790
00:53:49,500 --> 00:53:51,810
If you're done preparing, just let us know

1791
00:53:51,120 --> 00:53:52,000
I'm ready

1792
00:53:51,810 --> 00:53:53,340
Here we go!

1793
00:54:12,830 --> 00:54:15,000
This is when we should all cooperate together...

1794
00:54:15,000 --> 00:54:18,870
This is when we should all cooperate together...

1795
00:54:18,870 --> 00:54:20,870
Was it really that unfunny?

1796
00:54:21,200 --> 00:54:23,240
Maybe it's cause we couldn't really see your face

1797
00:54:23,240 --> 00:54:25,810
It would've been better if you'd show off more

1798
00:54:24,560 --> 00:54:25,810
Yeah this direction

1799
00:54:26,060 --> 00:54:26,870
Understood

1800
00:54:26,870 --> 00:54:27,270
Then, I'll do it three times

1801
00:54:27,270 --> 00:54:29,580
Then, I'll do it three times

1802
00:54:29,580 --> 00:54:30,340
With just one time I couldn't really get the timing

1803
00:54:30,340 --> 00:54:33,780
With just one time I couldn't really get the timing

1804
00:54:31,750 --> 00:54:32,680
Yeah, that figures

1805
00:54:32,330 --> 00:54:33,260
Yeah, yeah yeah

1806
00:54:33,780 --> 00:54:36,820
The face is important, the face

1807
00:54:35,400 --> 00:54:36,900
Since it's the same pattern

1808
00:54:37,250 --> 00:54:38,590
Okay, here we go

1809
00:55:06,910 --> 00:55:07,920
What?

1810
00:55:09,050 --> 00:55:12,320
Man, I didn't do anything bad though

1811
00:55:15,220 --> 00:55:16,760
You're laughing aren't you

1812
00:55:17,910 --> 00:55:19,490
This means I made someone laugh, right?

1813
00:55:19,490 --> 00:55:21,300
This is wrong though

1814
00:55:21,300 --> 00:55:22,630
No, no, no

1815
00:55:22,260 --> 00:55:24,530
What do you mean?

1816
00:55:23,710 --> 00:55:25,570
No, we laughed at something else

1817
00:55:25,900 --> 00:55:27,740
If we don't laugh during Hyokkori Han, it doesn't count

1818
00:55:27,740 --> 00:55:30,200
If we don't laugh during Hyokkori Han, it doesn't count

1819
00:55:30,200 --> 00:55:31,340
Is it even possible to get it right?

1820
00:55:31,340 --> 00:55:34,880
Should we try seven times?

1821
00:55:33,670 --> 00:55:34,880
No, no no

1822
00:55:34,880 --> 00:55:36,040
With Hyokkori Han...

1823
00:55:36,040 --> 00:55:38,980
Hamada-san, you could do it just by wearing the glasses

1824
00:55:39,780 --> 00:55:42,880
I'm not wearing this wig to be like Hyokkori Han

1825
00:55:42,880 --> 00:55:45,490
Yeah, but using the door is the correct way, right?

1826
00:55:46,490 --> 00:55:47,990
Why do I have to do this, it's Matsumoto's thing isn't it?

1827
00:55:47,990 --> 00:55:50,190
Why do I have to do this, it's Matsumoto's thing isn't it?

1828
00:55:50,190 --> 00:55:51,460
It's just seven times

1829
00:55:51,460 --> 00:55:53,690
Seven times is impossible though

1830
00:55:53,690 --> 00:55:56,230
You just do the Hyokkori face reveal

1831
00:55:56,230 --> 00:55:58,430
But I didn't have confidence doing it seven times either

1832
00:55:58,430 --> 00:56:01,740
But I didn't have confidence doing it seven times either

1833
00:56:01,740 --> 00:56:03,490
The three times one almost got me though

1834
00:56:03,140 --> 00:56:04,560
Oh really?

1835
00:56:04,910 --> 00:56:07,410
So you gotta do it right

1836
00:56:08,980 --> 00:56:12,050
Sit down, sit down...

1837
00:56:19,500 --> 00:56:21,890
What a jerk

1838
00:56:24,320 --> 00:56:27,530
Hey, make the noise!!

1839
00:56:29,000 --> 00:56:30,860
I was waiting forever!

1840
00:56:37,000 --> 00:56:39,110
Seriously, such a jerk

1841
00:56:38,660 --> 00:56:39,460
You're right

1842
00:56:40,000 --> 00:56:41,000
My bad, my bad

1843
00:56:40,880 --> 00:56:44,080
It suits you doesn't it

1844
00:56:46,410 --> 00:56:49,320
It so totally suits you

1845
00:56:49,320 --> 00:56:50,550
What the hell are you guys doing?

1846
00:56:51,150 --> 00:56:53,220
I'm on standby reluctantly

1847
00:56:53,220 --> 00:56:55,670
Hey Endo, go and fix up his bowtie

1848
00:56:55,910 --> 00:56:57,540
Your bowtie is off

1849
00:56:57,220 --> 00:56:58,850
That's right... it's important

1850
00:56:57,810 --> 00:56:59,510
That's very important

1851
00:56:59,660 --> 00:57:00,490
Okay, it's all good now

1852
00:57:00,490 --> 00:57:02,500
But you're starting to really look the part

1853
00:57:04,600 --> 00:57:06,630
Wish I could've seen it for the first time in action

1854
00:57:07,130 --> 00:57:09,020
It really suited him

1855
00:57:09,500 --> 00:57:11,820
What a jerk

1856
00:57:20,580 --> 00:57:21,620
Tsk!!

1857
00:57:22,350 --> 00:57:23,980
Make the noise!!

1858
00:57:26,650 --> 00:57:28,490
Make the noise!!

1859
00:57:31,760 --> 00:57:34,610
The way you came out was just like Hyokkori Han

1860
00:57:35,250 --> 00:57:36,230
You're doing the Hyokkori Han

1861
00:57:36,230 --> 00:57:39,370
You're doing the real thing

1862
00:57:41,750 --> 00:57:43,400
But maybe it's a bit off

1863
00:57:44,970 --> 00:57:47,040
But should the DVD go first or the envelope?

1864
00:57:47,040 --> 00:57:48,710
But should the DVD go first or the envelope?

1865
00:57:49,610 --> 00:57:51,410
This really doesn't feel like a letter

1866
00:57:51,410 --> 00:57:53,980
Let's take a look shall we?

1867
00:57:53,980 --> 00:57:55,550
Yeah, well of course

1868
00:57:55,550 --> 00:57:57,460
If we don't deal with it

1869
00:57:56,320 --> 00:57:57,890
This is a bit heavy

1870
00:58:01,260 --> 00:58:02,490
There's cards...

1871
00:58:02,760 --> 00:58:04,160
What?

1872
00:58:04,490 --> 00:58:07,130
Isn't this a tarot card set?

1873
00:58:07,130 --> 00:58:12,500
Mysterious cards

1874
00:58:09,600 --> 00:58:10,780
Are there instructions?

1875
00:58:10,780 --> 00:58:11,820
No, there aren't

1876
00:58:12,500 --> 00:58:13,620
Nothing, not even a letter

1877
00:58:13,730 --> 00:58:15,100
Then, the DVD!!

1878
00:58:15,670 --> 00:58:18,410
Do these go together then?

1879
00:58:18,410 --> 00:58:20,760
Yeah cause with just that you can't understand

1880
00:58:19,470 --> 00:58:22,080
Yeah, you're right. I don't get this by itself

1881
00:58:27,150 --> 00:58:29,880
I can't figure this out, what is this?

1882
00:58:30,500 --> 00:58:32,940
From the drawer, these cards!

1883
00:58:33,770 --> 00:58:39,140
Tanaka approaches the Thai Kick,

1884
00:58:33,770 --> 00:58:39,140
fair and square!

1885
00:58:33,850 --> 00:58:39,240
Instead of making it unreasonable, Tanaka will approach the Thai kick, fair and square

1886
00:58:38,980 --> 00:58:45,900
Using five cards

1887
00:58:38,980 --> 00:58:45,900
this will be a psychological warfare card battle!

1888
00:58:46,970 --> 00:58:49,670
These cards taken from the drawer!

1889
00:58:50,320 --> 00:58:55,790
Tanaka approaches the Thai Kick,

1890
00:58:50,320 --> 00:58:55,790
fair and square!

1891
00:58:50,490 --> 00:58:55,880
Instead of making it unreasonable, Tanaka will approach the Thai kick, fair and square

1892
00:58:55,530 --> 00:59:03,530
Using five cards

1893
00:58:55,530 --> 00:59:03,530
this will be a psychological warfare card battle!

1894
00:59:05,400 --> 00:59:10,490
The opponent and Tanaka will wage war with these 5 cards

1895
00:59:10,720 --> 00:59:16,060
Within those cards, there are 4 safe cards and 1 out card

1896
00:59:11,330 --> 00:59:16,580
There are 4 safe cards and 1 out card, for a total of 5 cards

1897
00:59:11,330 --> 00:59:16,580
There are 4 safe cards and 1 out card, for a total of 5 cards

1898
00:59:18,000 --> 00:59:23,090
First, the opponent selects a card, either safe or out

1899
00:59:18,580 --> 00:59:23,090
The first  to put down a card is the opponent

1900
00:59:18,580 --> 00:59:23,090
The first  to put down a card is the opponent

1901
00:59:23,540 --> 00:59:25,570
Keep the card facing down and place it on the field

1902
00:59:26,040 --> 00:59:31,040
Then Tanaka follows by selecting a card and placing it on the field

1903
00:59:32,280 --> 00:59:34,270
The possible combinations are:

1904
00:59:34,400 --> 00:59:35,780
Safe and safe

1905
00:59:37,320 --> 00:59:39,900
Safe and out

1906
00:59:40,620 --> 00:59:43,390
Out and out

1907
00:59:42,290 --> 00:59:44,890
3 possibilities

1908
00:59:44,890 --> 00:59:47,880
First, in the case of safe and safe

1909
00:59:45,380 --> 00:59:51,130
If both cards are safe

1910
00:59:45,380 --> 00:59:51,130
If both cards are safe

1911
00:59:47,540 --> 00:59:51,150
It's a draw

1912
00:59:48,200 --> 00:59:50,580
It's a draw

1913
00:59:50,760 --> 00:59:52,030
Continuing from there

1914
00:59:52,130 --> 00:59:56,820
From the remaining 4 cards, the game continues to the next round

1915
00:59:52,130 --> 00:59:56,820
From the remaining 4 cards, the game continues to the next round

1916
00:59:52,520 --> 00:59:55,890
From the remaining cards, the game continues to the next round

1917
00:59:56,820 --> 01:00:01,280
Next, if someone puts down an out card, ending in a safe and out card

1918
00:59:57,140 --> 01:00:01,930
If one card is an out regardless of who put it down, in that case

1919
00:59:57,140 --> 01:00:01,930
If one card is an out regardless of who put it down, in that case

1920
01:00:01,930 --> 01:00:04,330
This means Tanaka wins

1921
01:00:02,690 --> 01:00:09,220
Tanaka's victory!

1922
01:00:04,330 --> 01:00:09,220
Thai kick completely avoided!

1923
01:00:04,650 --> 01:00:08,350
No Thai kick for Tanaka and the game is over!

1924
01:00:09,870 --> 01:00:11,020
But the problem is...

1925
01:00:11,020 --> 01:00:13,590
If it's out and out!

1926
01:00:11,020 --> 01:00:14,400
If it's an out and out case

1927
01:00:11,020 --> 01:00:14,400
If it's an out and out case

1928
01:00:13,990 --> 01:00:15,960
This means the opponent wins

1929
01:00:15,170 --> 01:00:17,820
The opponent's victory

1930
01:00:16,740 --> 01:00:17,920
Tanaka loses

1931
01:00:17,920 --> 01:00:23,180
Thai kick is the punishment

1932
01:00:18,460 --> 01:00:22,110
And he gets a Thai kick as the punishment

1933
01:00:21,830 --> 01:00:23,630
But this is...

1934
01:00:23,630 --> 01:00:25,270
The chances are slim

1935
01:00:24,530 --> 01:00:26,520
Yeah, they are

1936
01:00:25,400 --> 01:00:27,320
The opponent puts the card out first

1937
01:00:27,320 --> 01:00:31,320
But only in the case that both use an out card, will there be a Thai kick

1938
01:00:29,670 --> 01:00:34,390
Tanaka has the overwhelming advantage

1939
01:00:31,540 --> 01:00:34,420
Tanaka has the overwhelming advantage

1940
01:00:34,690 --> 01:00:41,850
Reading and predicting your opponent's card order

1941
01:00:34,690 --> 01:00:41,850
Reading and predicting your opponent's card order

1942
01:00:35,040 --> 01:00:41,850
Key Point

1943
01:00:35,530 --> 01:00:37,380
Reading the opponent's mind

1944
01:00:37,380 --> 01:00:41,670
And predicting when they'll play the out card is the key!

1945
01:00:41,880 --> 01:00:46,170
The opponent in this competition is...

1946
01:00:42,470 --> 01:00:46,820
The opponent in this competition is...

1947
01:00:48,240 --> 01:00:48,390
Thai

1948
01:00:48,240 --> 01:00:48,390
Thai

1949
01:00:48,340 --> 01:00:48,490
Kick Boxer

1950
01:00:48,340 --> 01:00:48,490
Kick Boxer

1951
01:00:48,340 --> 01:00:48,490
Kick Boxer

1952
01:00:48,440 --> 01:00:51,580
Kick Boxer

1953
01:00:48,440 --> 01:00:51,580
Kick Boxer

1954
01:00:48,440 --> 01:00:51,580
Kick Boxer

1955
01:00:48,440 --> 01:00:51,580
Thai

1956
01:00:48,440 --> 01:00:51,580
Thai

1957
01:00:48,540 --> 01:00:49,390
Thai

1958
01:00:48,540 --> 01:00:49,510
Kick Boxer

1959
01:00:51,580 --> 01:00:55,500
One month ago

1960
01:00:52,970 --> 01:00:55,180
Around a month ago,

1961
01:00:55,500 --> 01:01:01,050
In order to prepare for this game, he asked for an expert

1962
01:01:00,690 --> 01:01:01,560
DaiGo?

1963
01:01:02,560 --> 01:01:04,650
This man knows everything about the human mind

1964
01:01:02,780 --> 01:01:03,980
A mentalist?

1965
01:01:04,670 --> 01:01:08,790
DaiGo, the mentalist who can grasp your thoughts!

1966
01:01:04,670 --> 01:01:08,790
T/N: They say DaiGo is a "mentalist", which really means he's a magician.

1967
01:01:10,130 --> 01:01:13,240
You start by taking the 2 cards

1968
01:01:10,780 --> 01:01:15,710
Begin training with the mentalist

1969
01:01:10,780 --> 01:01:15,710
Interpreter

1970
01:01:14,720 --> 01:01:18,890
With the help of an interpreter, he starts training

1971
01:01:15,890 --> 01:01:22,380
At first they train with two cards

1972
01:01:19,390 --> 01:01:22,140
They start with two cards

1973
01:01:23,500 --> 01:01:23,850
There

1974
01:01:32,290 --> 01:01:33,390
The main thing to think about is if I'll put down a 2 again


or if I'll change my mind. Have to consider these options

1975
01:01:33,390 --> 01:01:35,790
The main thing to think about is if I'll put down a 2 again

1976
01:01:35,790 --> 01:01:40,630
The main thing to think about is if I'll put down a 2 again


or if I'll change my mind. Have to consider these options

1977
01:01:40,680 --> 01:01:44,370
Gaze

1978
01:01:40,830 --> 01:01:44,370
Eye movement

1979
01:01:41,030 --> 01:01:44,370
Gestures

1980
01:01:41,450 --> 01:01:43,110
Your gaze, how your eyes move

1981
01:01:43,840 --> 01:01:49,930
The key to this battle is to grasp your opponent's heart

1982
01:01:44,600 --> 01:01:50,670
The path to victory lies in understanding your enemy

1983
01:01:49,510 --> 01:01:50,870
The hell is this

1984
01:01:50,680 --> 01:01:54,240
One week has passed

1985
01:01:50,680 --> 01:01:54,240
Since their training started,

1986
01:01:51,330 --> 01:01:53,880
One week has passed since they started training

1987
01:01:54,390 --> 01:01:56,570
We're upping the difficulty today

1988
01:01:56,570 --> 01:02:02,750
Instead of two cards, we'll try it with three this time

1989
01:01:58,550 --> 01:02:03,050
They switch to three cards in their training

1990
01:02:03,050 --> 01:02:03,900
Reveal

1991
01:02:07,340 --> 01:02:09,140
He's really desperate to beat you, Tanaka

1992
01:02:10,660 --> 01:02:15,100
Increasing the difficulty

1993
01:02:10,680 --> 01:02:14,890
Just by increasing the number of cards,
you can increase the difficulty

1994
01:02:15,100 --> 01:02:18,200
What's important is to look at your opponent in the eyes


and pressure them

1995
01:02:18,200 --> 01:02:21,200
What's important is to look at your opponent in the eyes


and pressure them

1996
01:02:21,800 --> 01:02:22,470
Like, "I can see through you" or something like that

1997
01:02:22,470 --> 01:02:25,810
Like, "I can see through you" or something like that

1998
01:02:24,780 --> 01:02:25,880
Cool to see this

1999
01:02:26,530 --> 01:02:34,400
As he corners Tanaka's mind, he raises his advantage

2000
01:02:26,570 --> 01:02:30,360
He can't make any mistakes in cornering Tanaka's mind

2001
01:02:26,930 --> 01:02:28,770
Yeah but it's all to beat me...

2002
01:02:30,410 --> 01:02:32,120
He's revealing this to me

2003
01:02:30,920 --> 01:02:33,960
And he works on raising his chances of winning

2004
01:02:33,960 --> 01:02:36,200
They want to show off his skills

2005
01:02:37,020 --> 01:02:45,430
Practice continues daily

2006
01:02:38,360 --> 01:02:41,150
His long practice sessions continue

2007
01:02:41,870 --> 01:02:44,530
The fruits of his labors start to become apparent

2008
01:02:45,430 --> 01:02:49,700
Since starting the training

2009
01:02:45,430 --> 01:02:49,700
Three weeks have passed

2010
01:02:45,850 --> 01:02:49,690
At the three week mark since starting the training...

2011
01:02:50,070 --> 01:02:52,390
It really takes that long, huh

2012
01:02:56,150 --> 01:02:56,780
Sweet

2013
01:03:01,780 --> 01:03:02,790
Well done!

2014
01:03:03,180 --> 01:03:06,950
Three cards

2015
01:03:04,380 --> 01:03:04,510
perfect result

2016
01:03:04,500 --> 01:03:04,650
perfect result

2017
01:03:04,650 --> 01:03:06,650
perfect result

2018
01:03:04,780 --> 01:03:06,950
perfect result

2019
01:03:11,660 --> 01:03:16,040
And if you throw the last card, it's your win

2020
01:03:18,360 --> 01:03:20,230
He's a lot better than I thought he would be

2021
01:03:20,460 --> 01:03:26,340
Thai Kick Boxer

2022
01:03:20,460 --> 01:03:26,340
The one who understands his enemy's mind completely

2023
01:03:21,150 --> 01:03:24,440
He's completely grasped his opponent's thoughts

2024
01:03:24,440 --> 01:03:27,790
At this point, the number of cards doesn't matter

2025
01:03:28,560 --> 01:03:30,350
Seriously?

2026
01:03:30,040 --> 01:03:32,480
I think he'll do better than we thought

2027
01:03:32,480 --> 01:03:33,210
Probably, he won't even have to try hard to win

2028
01:03:33,210 --> 01:03:35,710
Probably, he won't even have to try hard to win

2029
01:03:35,710 --> 01:03:37,360
In the end, he's almost unbeatable

2030
01:03:37,380 --> 01:03:40,780
He has a 92.3% success rate

2031
01:03:40,450 --> 01:03:42,890
What is even going on?

2032
01:03:43,150 --> 01:03:44,790
He's already reached the top, I think

2033
01:03:45,250 --> 01:03:48,960
Ending up with a perfect score, he has no weakness

2034
01:03:45,960 --> 01:03:50,390
The strongest mentality





with no weakness!

2035
01:03:49,440 --> 01:03:52,510
This is kinda like magic?

2036
01:03:50,680 --> 01:03:53,930
Battle

2037
01:03:50,910 --> 01:03:52,890
So their battle begins!

2038
01:03:53,900 --> 01:03:54,810
Well, here we are

2039
01:04:01,840 --> 01:04:03,940
And there he is!

2040
01:04:09,230 --> 01:04:12,250
But this time, Tanaka's

2041
01:04:13,100 --> 01:04:13,750
Got a chance

2042
01:04:13,750 --> 01:04:14,830
Let's begin!

2043
01:04:15,160 --> 01:04:15,750
Tanaka-sama

2044
01:04:15,160 --> 01:04:17,390
T/N: The "-sama" suffix is used for important and respected people. In this context, they're treating Tanaka and Thai Kick as honored contestants.

2045
01:04:16,680 --> 01:04:17,430
Thai Kick-sama

2046
01:04:17,650 --> 01:04:18,730
Please take a seat

2047
01:04:19,100 --> 01:04:20,320
It'll be fine!

2048
01:04:20,890 --> 01:04:22,760
As long as we both don't put down the OUT card


then all other combinations are safe, right?

2049
01:04:22,760 --> 01:04:25,830
As long as we both don't put down the OUT card


then all other combinations are safe, right?

2050
01:04:24,260 --> 01:04:26,190
They've always been too unreasonable

2051
01:04:26,700 --> 01:04:27,530
This time they're playing a fair game it seems

2052
01:04:27,190 --> 01:04:30,370
This time they're playing a fair game it seems

2053
01:04:28,820 --> 01:04:30,370
What are the chances here?

2054
01:04:30,480 --> 01:04:34,200
Seems like it's high. But Thai Kick's at a 92% win rate

2055
01:04:34,200 --> 01:04:35,360
It'll be fine!

2056
01:04:35,540 --> 01:04:37,910
He's staring like crazy

2057
01:04:38,150 --> 01:04:42,230
And now, the Thai Kick psychological warfare card battle!

2058
01:04:42,310 --> 01:04:43,580
First, both contestants, please select your first card

2059
01:04:43,580 --> 01:04:46,320
First, both contestants, please select your first card

2060
01:04:46,290 --> 01:04:48,090
You have a look on your face like you
know you're going to get kicked

2061
01:04:46,880 --> 01:04:49,020
Think about it...

2062
01:04:49,020 --> 01:04:49,890
Ever since you started, he's been staring at you

2063
01:04:49,890 --> 01:04:52,620
Ever since you started, he's been staring at you

2064
01:04:52,670 --> 01:04:56,230
First, Thai Kick-sama will lay down his card

2065
01:04:58,830 --> 01:05:55,110
Thai Kick

2066
01:05:00,670 --> 01:05:03,250
And now, Tanaka-sama, please place your card

2067
01:05:05,500 --> 01:05:55,110
Tanaka

2068
01:05:09,610 --> 01:05:11,640
And now, to reveal the cards

2069
01:05:11,850 --> 01:05:14,430
First, Tanaka-sama's card

2070
01:05:16,870 --> 01:05:17,530
Reveal!

2071
01:05:19,970 --> 01:05:21,070
He chose the Safe card

2072
01:05:21,480 --> 01:05:23,640
And now for Thai Kick-sama's card

2073
01:05:23,690 --> 01:05:30,530
Safe card

2074
01:05:23,740 --> 01:05:29,030
If his card is also Safe, they both discard and move to the next turn

2075
01:05:27,720 --> 01:05:30,530
it's a draw

2076
01:05:29,250 --> 01:05:33,210
However, if his card is the Out card

2077
01:05:31,690 --> 01:05:39,740
Out card

2078
01:05:33,520 --> 01:05:35,870
In that case,

2079
01:05:36,160 --> 01:05:39,310
You will be spared from the Thai Kick

2080
01:05:36,200 --> 01:05:39,740
Tanaka's win

2081
01:05:39,740 --> 01:05:42,570
Do your best!

2082
01:05:41,670 --> 01:05:42,500
That said,

2083
01:05:43,410 --> 01:05:45,080
Thai Kick-sama's card...

2084
01:05:45,080 --> 01:05:47,320
Go with "Out"!

2085
01:05:47,320 --> 01:05:48,170
Reveal!

2086
01:05:49,050 --> 01:05:54,730
It's a draw so they continue onward

2087
01:05:49,640 --> 01:05:50,410
Well, that's alright

2088
01:05:50,810 --> 01:05:53,130
The outcome was Safe-Safe

2089
01:05:53,380 --> 01:05:53,960
I see...

2090
01:05:53,950 --> 01:05:56,380
Well it's only the first one

2091
01:05:55,860 --> 01:05:56,820
That's true

2092
01:05:57,390 --> 01:05:58,520
Tanaka's face keeps getting weirder

2093
01:05:58,520 --> 01:05:59,810
Tanaka's face keeps getting weirder

2094
01:06:00,720 --> 01:06:01,910
Onward, to the second turn

2095
01:06:02,060 --> 01:06:04,430
He's being driven into a corner

2096
01:06:05,370 --> 01:06:06,300
Thai Kick-sama, if you will

2097
01:06:06,940 --> 01:06:08,120
Put down your card

2098
01:06:10,330 --> 01:06:40,760
Thai Kick

2099
01:06:12,370 --> 01:06:13,260
And now

2100
01:06:14,360 --> 01:06:16,350
Tanaka-sama, put down your card

2101
01:06:17,110 --> 01:06:40,760
Tanaka

2102
01:06:19,850 --> 01:06:21,480
And now, I will reveal the cards

2103
01:06:24,180 --> 01:06:24,810
Reveal!

2104
01:06:26,810 --> 01:06:27,880
Safe card

2105
01:06:27,520 --> 01:06:30,220
Don't you think he's being timid?

2106
01:06:28,780 --> 01:06:31,430
And next, Thai Kick-sama

2107
01:06:32,160 --> 01:06:32,910
Your card...

2108
01:06:34,540 --> 01:06:35,490
Reveal!

2109
01:06:36,030 --> 01:06:41,050
It's a draw so they continue onward

2110
01:06:38,150 --> 01:06:40,260
The cards were Safe-Safe

2111
01:06:42,130 --> 01:06:43,900
This is bad, you're down to 3 now

2112
01:06:43,900 --> 01:06:46,500
This is bad, you're down to 3 now

2113
01:06:46,500 --> 01:06:49,240
Now, the third turn will begin

2114
01:06:49,240 --> 01:06:50,520
Thai Kick-sama, please put down your card

2115
01:06:51,870 --> 01:06:53,160
Hell is with that face

2116
01:06:51,870 --> 01:06:53,810
If Tanaka loses this, he can't complain much

2117
01:06:53,810 --> 01:06:55,810
If Tanaka loses this, he can't complain much

2118
01:06:55,780 --> 01:07:50,640
Thai Kick

2119
01:06:58,350 --> 01:07:01,460
Second, Tanaka-sama, please put down your card

2120
01:07:09,050 --> 01:07:10,090
This is excruciating

2121
01:07:11,230 --> 01:07:12,760
He's hesitating, right

2122
01:07:12,840 --> 01:07:14,370
Don't waver now!

2123
01:07:15,430 --> 01:07:17,330
Dude, you can't tell by looking so hurry up...

2124
01:07:17,330 --> 01:07:19,970
Dude, you can't tell by looking so hurry up...

2125
01:07:19,310 --> 01:07:20,870
Yeah he didn't train like Thai Kick did

2126
01:07:21,370 --> 01:07:23,670
Don't try to look cool

2127
01:07:24,940 --> 01:07:50,640
Tanaka

2128
01:07:27,480 --> 01:07:29,820
Here we go, let's check the cards

2129
01:07:30,870 --> 01:07:31,350
Reveal!

2130
01:07:31,360 --> 01:07:32,140
Safe again...

2131
01:07:32,860 --> 01:07:33,630
I see

2132
01:07:33,660 --> 01:07:34,700
That's what you did...

2133
01:07:34,570 --> 01:07:35,550
Safe card

2134
01:07:35,960 --> 01:07:36,930
And now

2135
01:07:36,920 --> 01:07:39,590
Go with the Out, come on

2136
01:07:38,590 --> 01:07:39,880
Thai Kick-sama's card

2137
01:07:41,840 --> 01:07:42,270
Reveal!

2138
01:07:43,660 --> 01:07:50,480
It's a draw so they go onward

2139
01:07:44,460 --> 01:07:45,910
They both played the Safe Card

2140
01:07:46,470 --> 01:07:48,460
This is amazing

2141
01:07:46,840 --> 01:07:49,210
And with the end of this turn

2142
01:07:49,200 --> 01:07:49,840
Oh no

2143
01:07:49,840 --> 01:07:51,670
We now enter the last turn

2144
01:07:51,670 --> 01:07:54,540
Ah! The last turn is here!

2145
01:07:54,540 --> 01:08:01,310
At this time, if they choose different cards,

2146
01:07:58,110 --> 01:08:01,310
Tanaka will be able to avoid the Thai Kick!

2147
01:08:01,310 --> 01:08:04,010
Great duel so far, eh?

2148
01:08:02,410 --> 01:08:03,730
Let's begin the last turn

2149
01:08:04,010 --> 01:08:07,220
At this point, you really

2150
01:08:04,490 --> 01:08:06,850
Thai Kick-sama, your card

2151
01:08:05,230 --> 01:08:07,210
can't let yourself be driven into a corner

2152
01:08:06,590 --> 01:08:08,670
Yeah, you really shouldn't. Should've gone for it sooner

2153
01:08:08,680 --> 01:08:10,120
Your face keeps getting weirder, Tanaka!

2154
01:08:10,120 --> 01:08:12,890
Your face keeps getting weirder, Tanaka!

2155
01:08:10,270 --> 01:08:13,080
Do your best! Fight!

2156
01:08:13,820 --> 01:08:57,590
Thai Kick

2157
01:08:14,760 --> 01:08:16,930
What are you even looking at?

2158
01:08:16,930 --> 01:08:19,500
Then again, he didn't do any training at all

2159
01:08:22,630 --> 01:08:57,590
Tanaka

2160
01:08:24,110 --> 01:08:25,180
This is the decisive one

2161
01:08:25,150 --> 01:08:26,570
You'll be fine if it's not the same

2162
01:08:26,970 --> 01:08:28,860
Now, let us reveal the cards

2163
01:08:29,190 --> 01:08:31,720
First, Tanaka-sama's card

2164
01:08:33,770 --> 01:08:34,470
Reveal!

2165
01:08:35,650 --> 01:08:38,880
I get why you'd want to throw that card here

2166
01:08:42,040 --> 01:08:43,440
Next, Thai Kick-sama's card

2167
01:08:47,240 --> 01:08:47,920
Reveal!

2168
01:08:48,070 --> 01:08:50,760
Yeeeeeeeeees!

2169
01:08:49,540 --> 01:08:52,980
Out-Safe cards!

2170
01:08:50,760 --> 01:08:57,800
Tanaka wins! He avoids the Thai Kick!!

2171
01:08:53,120 --> 01:08:53,950
I did it!

2172
01:09:00,320 --> 01:09:01,300
Yeah!!

2173
01:09:01,320 --> 01:09:03,510
I totally thought he'd lose there

2174
01:09:03,270 --> 01:09:03,930
YES!

2175
01:09:04,000 --> 01:09:05,070
That was close!

2176
01:09:05,140 --> 01:09:06,980
I made it!

2177
01:09:05,520 --> 01:09:07,440
That was amazing!

2178
01:09:07,440 --> 01:09:09,990
He's going back!

2179
01:09:08,650 --> 01:09:09,350
YES!

2180
01:09:09,980 --> 01:09:10,470
Awesome!

2181
01:09:12,620 --> 01:09:16,290
I thought that would be the best time to play the Out

2182
01:09:14,980 --> 01:09:15,630
Awesome

2183
01:09:16,290 --> 01:09:18,720
From the drawer, these cards!

2184
01:09:19,340 --> 01:09:21,990
Instead of making it unreasonable

2185
01:09:22,510 --> 01:09:25,190
Tanaka will approach the Thai kick, fair and square

2186
01:09:25,540 --> 01:09:30,740
Using 4 cards, this will be a psychological warfare card battle!

2187

2202
01:09:39,350 --> 01:09:40,980
The fight begins!

2203
01:09:42,010 --> 01:09:44,610
You already fought him though?

2204
01:09:45,480 --> 01:09:46,720
No no no

2205
01:09:46,720 --> 01:09:49,390
No no no

2206
01:09:49,390 --> 01:09:51,280
This is wrong, we just did this!

2207
01:09:49,390 --> 01:09:55,530
He returns like nothing happened

2208
01:09:52,940 --> 01:09:54,290
Like nothing happened...

2209
01:09:53,570 --> 01:09:55,730
No no no, we... Just now...

2210
01:09:55,730 --> 01:09:59,100
C'mon I already won!

2211
01:09:56,690 --> 01:09:58,490
These guys are acting like
nothing happened

2212
01:09:59,100 --> 01:10:02,230
So, Tanaka-sama, please take a seat

2213
01:10:01,430 --> 01:10:02,230
So, Tanaka-sama, please take a seat

2214
01:10:02,230 --> 01:10:04,000
No but, I already, before...

2215
01:10:04,000 --> 01:10:06,000
Do your best

2216
01:10:05,000 --> 01:10:06,100
Do your best, Tanaka!

2217
01:10:06,100 --> 01:10:08,270
But I avoided the kick already, right?

2218
01:10:08,590 --> 01:10:09,020
You can do it

2219
01:10:09,800 --> 01:10:10,240
Now then

2220
01:10:10,240 --> 01:10:10,870
The number is lower than before

2221
01:10:10,870 --> 01:10:12,640
The number is lower than before

2222
01:10:11,510 --> 01:10:12,720
Three Safe Cards

2223
01:10:12,720 --> 01:10:13,400
I see

2224
01:10:13,400 --> 01:10:14,860
Just one Out Card

2225
01:10:14,180 --> 01:10:17,880
The number went down by one eh?

2226
01:10:15,390 --> 01:10:17,110
Give Thai Kick-sama his cards

2227
01:10:17,880 --> 01:10:18,990
That means this fight will be over faster

2228
01:10:19,050 --> 01:10:19,320
No, I already won earlier

2229
01:10:19,320 --> 01:10:21,120
No, I already won earlier

2230
01:10:21,120 --> 01:10:22,250
You say "Earlier," but I don't really understand

2231
01:10:22,250 --> 01:10:23,890
You say "Earlier," but I don't really understand

2232
01:10:23,890 --> 01:10:25,190
The first challenge

2233
01:10:25,190 --> 01:10:26,580
The preparations are complete

2234
01:10:26,260 --> 01:10:27,180
You understand, right?

2235

01:10:27,920 --> 01:10:30,190

This isn't right though

2246
01:10:49,880 --> 01:10:53,180
The cards have been chosen, I'll check them now

2247
01:10:54,470 --> 01:10:55,250

2248
01:10:56,250 --> 01:10:57,450

2249
01:10:57,450 --> 01:10:59,390

2250
01:10:58,890 --> 01:11:02,190
He attacked

2251
01:11:00,490 --> 01:11:02,190
I just avoided it, but you know

2252
01:11:02,630 --> 01:11:04,660
Here we go

2253
01:11:03,530 --> 01:11:06,900
Don't talk about the past

2254
01:11:05,540 --> 01:11:06,900

Thai Kick's card...

2257
01:11:09,230 --> 01:11:11,670
He's staring so intensely

Reveal

2259
01:11:13,220 --> 01:11:20,140

01:11:13,220 --> 01:11:20,140
Tanaka wins! Thai Kick avoided!!

2261
01:11:13,220 --> 01:11:20,140
Tanaka wins! Thai Kick avoided!!

2262
01:11:15,450 --> 01:11:20,810
The out card beats the safe card, saving Tanaka!

2263
01:11:21,510 --> 01:11:23,110
That was good

2264
01:11:21,890 --> 01:11:23,610
Nice job, Tanaka!

2265
01:11:23,110 --> 01:11:26,750
Thank you very much, thank you

2266
01:11:23,930 --> 01:11:26,750
That was perfect!

2267
01:11:26,750 --> 01:11:29,390
He's going home

2268
01:11:27,520 --> 01:11:29,390
Good, good

2269
01:11:29,390 --> 01:11:32,890
I knew you could do it!!

2270
01:11:30,920 --> 01:11:32,890
That was great!

2271
01:11:32,890 --> 01:11:34,260
Before, I avoided the kick
with the 5-card battle, right?

2272
01:11:34,260 --> 01:11:39,960
Before, I avoided the kick
with the 5-card battle, right?

2273
01:11:38,090 --> 01:11:39,960
I mean, Tanaka...

2274
01:11:39,960 --> 01:11:41,330
Let's not mention that anymore

2275
01:11:40,980 --> 01:11:43,070
Exactly

2276
01:11:41,330 --> 01:11:43,070
Let's not mention that anymore

2277
01:11:43,070 --> 01:11:44,130
You avoided it, so

2278
01:11:45,140 --> 01:11:46,400
Look

2279
01:11:46,400 --> 01:11:47,200

Look, look

2281
01:11:49,170 --> 01:11:50,240
Now it'll be 3 cards

2282
01:11:49,170 --> 01:11:51,020
Instead of making it unreasonable

2283
01:11:51,020 --> 01:11:53,330
Tanaka will approach the Thai kick, fair and square

2284
01:11:51,080 --> 01:11:53,310
3 cards, right?

2285
01:11:53,640 --> 01:11:58,250
Using 2 cards, this will be a psychological warfare card battle!

2286
01:11:53,660 --> 01:11:58,260

The opponent is...

2289
01:11:58,380 --> 01:12:00,400
Who's he gonna
play against?

2290
01:12:00,400 --> 01:12:01,720
"Who am I
gonna play?"

2291
01:12:01,720 --> 01:12:03,520

This is it, Tanaka

2309
01:12:11,230 --> 01:12:13,230
No, not "this is it"

2310
01:12:12,110 --> 01:12:13,230
Nothing you can do about it

2311
01:12:13,230 --> 01:12:13,980
Wait

2312
01:12:13,980 --> 01:12:16,500
If you win this time you'll definitely be fine

2313
01:12:22,170 --> 01:12:25,170
Huh!?

2314
01:12:22,960 --> 01:12:25,170
Oh yea...

2315
01:12:26,180 --> 01:12:29,710
Suspicious glasses & earphones

2316
01:12:28,690 --> 01:12:31,300
I will be the officiator for this battle this afternoon

01:12:31,300 --> 01:12:33,080
Let's have a good clean battle

2318

Is this guy alright?

2319
01:12:35,570 --> 01:12:36,850
Alright then, Tanaka-sama

2320
01:12:41,660 --> 01:12:41,890

Ha Ha Ha...

2323
01:12:49,150 --> 01:12:50,880
Once you look at him...

2324
01:12:50,880 --> 01:12:52,370
It's just...

2325
01:12:51,750 --> 01:12:52,370
Right?

2326
01:12:55,520 --> 01:12:57,040
He still might be able to win, you know?

2327
01:12:57,040 --> 01:12:57,770
There's...

2328
01:12:57,770 --> 01:12:59,100
There's still a chance

2329
01:12:58,280 --> 01:12:59,540
Uhhh, huh?

2330
01:12:59,540 --> 01:13:00,210
Uhhh, huh?

2331
01:13:00,710 --> 01:13:02,980
So harsh

2332
01:13:01,750 --> 01:13:02,980
You don't know yet

2333
01:13:01,980 --> 01:13:02,980
Huh?

Good luck!

2338
01:13:07,450 --> 01:13:08,920

01:13:07,970 --> 01:13:08,920
Protect yourself

2340
01:13:08,920 --> 01:13:12,090
But I already won twice...

2341
01:13:11,780 --> 01:13:13,070
Don't lose

2342
01:13:13,070 --> 01:13:15,590
Focus, you can do it

2343
01:13:14,460 --> 01:13:15,590
You can win!

2344
01:13:15,830 --> 01:13:17,690
First off, both of you

01:13:17,690 --> 01:13:19,530
Choose the first card you will place

2346
01:13:19,430 --> 01:13:21,400
What was all
that training for?

2347
01:13:19,530 --> 01:13:22,070
Choose the first card you will place

2348
01:13:21,400 --> 01:13:22,060
Good point

2349
01:13:22,380 --> 01:13:24,090
Just focus

2350
01:13:28,190 --> 01:13:29,410
Alright, now first Tanaka-sama

2351
01:13:29,410 --> 01:13:30,440
Alright, now first Tanaka-sama

2352
01:13:30,440 --> 01:13:35,180
Tanaka goes first this time for some reason

2353
01:13:36,680 --> 01:14:50,550
Tanaka

2354
01:13:38,510 --> 01:13:41,050
He's so slithery

2355
01:13:38,510 --> 01:13:41,050
You got this

2356
01:13:41,050 --> 01:13:42,420

2361
01:14:06,480 --> 01:14:07,430

2362
01:14:12,080 --> 01:14:14,140
It's ok

2363
01:14:14,130 --> 01:14:16,150
You still got this

2364
01:14:15,090 --> 01:14:17,720
It's still anyone's game!!

2365
01:14:16,150 --> 01:14:17,720
You got this, Tanaka

2366
01:14:17,720 --> 01:14:20,660
Thai Kick-sama, please check
your card one more time

2367
01:14:20,660 --> 01:14:21,390
This is...

2368
01:14:21,390 --> 01:14:23,330
Is that your final choice?

2369
01:14:27,680 --> 01:14:31,000
Thai Kick-sama's card is an OUT card

2370
01:14:31,770 --> 01:14:33,340
If Tanaka's is an OUT card, he will receive a Thai kick

2371
01:14:31,770 --> 01:14:33,340
If Tanaka's is an OUT card, he will receive a Thai kick

2372
01:14:33,340 --> 01:14:36,470
If Tanaka's is an OUT card, he will receive a Thai kick

2373
01:14:33,340 --> 01:14:36,470
If Tanaka's is an OUT card, he will receive a Thai kick

2374
01:14:36,470 --> 01:14:37,970
Now, for Tanaka's card

2375
01:14:37,970 --> 01:14:39,660
Now, for Tanaka's card

2376
01:14:40,770 --> 01:14:42,360
Just end it

2377
01:14:42,810 --> 01:14:44,680
REVEAL!

2378
01:14:45,870 --> 01:14:47,200
Out, out!

2379
01:14:47,200 --> 01:14:49,060
Thai kick confirmed!

2380
01:14:47,480 --> 01:14:50,550
TANAKA LOSES

2381
01:14:49,060 --> 01:14:50,550
You were so close!

2382
01:14:50,550 --> 01:14:55,790
This is ridiculous, it's unfair

2383
01:14:55,790 --> 01:14:58,460
It's unfair, wait a second

2384
01:14:58,460 --> 01:15:00,460
Isn't this a little harsh?

2385
01:14:59,800 --> 01:15:00,460
Well I mean...

2386
01:15:00,460 --> 01:15:01,600
It's unreasonable

2387
01:15:01,600 --> 01:15:03,400
There's nothing you can do about it now

2388
01:15:02,250 --> 01:15:03,400
This is unjust

2389
01:15:03,400 --> 01:15:04,870
This is wrong

2390
01:15:04,870 --> 01:15:09,140
This is the

2391
01:15:05,800 --> 01:15:09,140
harshest Thai kick I've ever had to take

2392
01:15:07,440 --> 01:15:10,000
You have to stick your butt out more

2393
01:15:10,000 --> 01:15:11,640
You'll get hurt

2394
01:15:11,640 --> 01:15:13,160
Stick your butt out

2395
01:15:12,240 --> 01:15:13,160
Woah

01:16:16,510 --> 01:16:19,010
You can't accuse him of that

01:16:17,540 --> 01:16:19,010
No way, that was suspicious

2649
01:16:19,010 --> 01:16:21,010

3245
01:28:43,540 --> 01:28:44,690
Of course I am

3246
01:28:44,690 --> 01:28:47,690

01:29:05,680 --> 01:29:07,710
Professional voice actor

3266
01:29:06,110 --> 01:29:07,710
I have to go in front!?

3267
01:29:07,730 --> 01:29:10,110
What'd I do to deserve this?

3268
01:29:10,110 --> 01:29:13,480
Pull with all your might, it's an electrifying tug of war!

3269
01:29:11,840 --> 01:29:18,720
Give it all you got!

3270
01:29:26,100 --> 01:29:26,460
STOP!!

3271
01:29:26,460 --> 01:29:27,800
STOP!!

3272
01:29:27,800 --> 01:29:28,300
STOP!!

3273
01:29:28,300 --> 01:29:29,900
STOP!!

3274
01:29:32,030 --> 01:29:32,700
That was crazy     They got outdone

3275
01:29:32,700 --> 01:29:34,080
That was crazy     They got outdone

3276
01:29:34,070 --> 01:29:36,240
You guys fell down

3277
01:29:35,740 --> 01:29:36,240
Yeah...

3278
01:29:36,240 --> 01:29:37,170
We got shocked!!

3279
01:29:37,170 --> 01:29:39,140
We got shocked!!

3280
01:29:38,200 --> 01:29:39,140
by the electricity!!

3281
01:29:39,140 --> 01:29:42,080
How was it?

3282
01:29:41,110 --> 01:29:42,090
The electricity got us

3283
01:29:42,080 --> 01:29:43,070
How was it?

3284
01:29:42,970 --> 01:29:45,040
No way! No!

3285
01:29:47,020 --> 01:29:48,980
Did you feel it? Did you?

3286
01:29:49,080 --> 01:29:50,750
You can't move them?

3287
01:29:51,250 --> 01:29:52,760
Grasp the rope again

3288
01:29:52,270 --> 01:29:53,730
Everyone felt, even over here

3289
01:29:54,910 --> 01:29:56,460
We felt it way over here too

3290
01:29:56,760 --> 01:29:59,060
If we added Ms. Murakami we might stand a chance?

3291
01:29:59,060 --> 01:30:01,600
Let's add Ms. Murakami

3292
01:30:01,600 --> 01:30:03,800
What!! No! Why!?

3293
01:30:02,900 --> 01:30:03,300
Sorry...     Go right here

3294
01:30:03,300 --> 01:30:05,830
Sorry...     Go right here

3295
01:30:05,400 --> 01:30:07,600
It wasn't much of a challenge last time

3296
01:30:07,600 --> 01:30:11,920
Pull with all your might, it's an electrifying tug of war!

3297
01:30:12,430 --> 01:30:13,100
Again

3298
01:30:13,840 --> 01:30:14,690
Here we go

3299
01:30:15,040 --> 01:30:15,710
Eh

3300
01:30:15,710 --> 01:30:16,540
Come on!

3301
01:30:16,900 --> 01:30:17,490
Watch out!

3302
01:30:18,070 --> 01:30:18,220
Woah

3303
01:30:18,260 --> 01:30:18,430
Woah

3304
01:30:18,480 --> 01:30:18,650
Woah

3305
01:30:18,680 --> 01:30:18,830
Woah

3306
01:30:18,770 --> 01:30:19,590
You're good!

3307
01:30:18,870 --> 01:30:19,020
Woah

3308
01:30:19,820 --> 01:30:20,570
Come on!

3309
01:30:22,500 --> 01:30:22,940
You can do it!

3310
01:30:22,980 --> 01:30:23,250
You can do it!

3311
01:30:23,280 --> 01:30:23,540
You can do it!

3312
01:30:23,900 --> 01:30:24,090
You can do it!

3313
01:30:24,130 --> 01:30:24,410
You can do it!

3314
01:30:24,440 --> 01:30:24,760
You can do it!

3315
01:30:24,480 --> 01:30:24,710
No good

3316
01:30:24,730 --> 01:30:25,130
No good

3317
01:30:25,600 --> 01:30:26,250
Stand up!

3318
01:30:26,280 --> 01:30:26,470
Stand up!

3319
01:30:26,500 --> 01:30:26,680
Stand up!

3320
01:30:26,710 --> 01:30:27,140
Stand up!

3321
01:30:27,990 --> 01:30:28,150
Woah

3322
01:30:28,160 --> 01:30:28,280
Woah

3323
01:30:28,300 --> 01:30:28,400
Woah

3324
01:30:28,420 --> 01:30:28,490
Woah

3325
01:30:28,490 --> 01:30:28,800
Woah

3326
01:30:32,180 --> 01:30:32,260
Ow

3327
01:30:32,330 --> 01:30:32,430
Ow!

3328
01:30:32,470 --> 01:30:32,540
Ow!!

3329
01:30:32,580 --> 01:30:32,650
Ow!!!

3330
01:30:32,710 --> 01:30:32,790
Ow!!!!

3331
01:30:32,870 --> 01:30:32,940
Ow!!!!!

3332
01:30:33,870 --> 01:30:35,690
What just happened?

3333
01:30:35,690 --> 01:30:38,270
really

3334
01:30:36,030 --> 01:30:38,270
really

3335
01:30:36,470 --> 01:30:37,260
For real?

3336
01:30:36,530 --> 01:30:38,270
really

3337
01:30:36,830 --> 01:30:38,270
really

3338
01:30:37,410 --> 01:30:38,260
I'm not joking

3339
01:30:38,450 --> 01:30:39,070
It was real

3340
01:30:38,480 --> 01:30:39,100
Eeeh?

3341
01:30:39,090 --> 01:30:39,810
I swear

3342
01:30:39,100 --> 01:30:39,810
You sure?

3343
01:30:40,030 --> 01:30:41,390
I swear it got me

3344
01:30:41,200 --> 01:30:41,990
Wait...

3345
01:30:41,610 --> 01:30:42,370
I swear!

3346
01:30:43,070 --> 01:30:45,000
What about you, Zaki-san?

3347
01:30:43,650 --> 01:30:45,060
No way you were zapped!

3348
01:30:45,010 --> 01:30:46,330
It zapped me so much, I never felt this before!!

3349
01:30:46,330 --> 01:30:47,540
It zapped me so much, I never felt this before!!

3350
01:30:47,550 --> 01:30:48,390
Alright then

3351
01:30:48,390 --> 01:30:49,340
To be honest...

3352
01:30:48,800 --> 01:30:49,320
Yeah?

3353
01:30:49,340 --> 01:30:50,370
Just to be honest...

3354
01:30:49,840 --> 01:30:50,350
Yeah

3355
01:30:50,810 --> 01:30:54,610
I could feel it just a tiny bit

3356
01:30:55,210 --> 01:30:56,250
What the hell!?

Is a simple calculation between 2 and 10

3385
01:31:17,650 --> 01:31:20,380
Quickly use both your hands to answer

3386
01:31:21,500 --> 01:31:28,380
Answer Quickly!! Two-Handed Arithmetic!!

3387
01:31:21,500 --> 01:31:28,380
If the answer is wrong, answered with
only one hand, or unable to follow
the rhythm, the player is OUT

3388
01:31:21,500 --> 01:31:28,380
m 0 0 l 510 0 510 45 0 45

3389

m 0 0 l 605 0 605 100 0 100

3390
01:31:21,620 --> 01:31:23,220
If you answer wrongly

3391
01:31:23,540 --> 01:31:25,610
Or if you fail to use both your hands

3392
01:31:25,630 --> 01:31:27,610
You're disqualified!

3393
01:31:28,390 --> 01:31:30,780
First of all, a demonstration from Junior

3394
01:31:30,550 --> 01:31:37,620
m 0 0 l 0 102 l 1143 102 l 1143 0

3395
01:31:30,600 --> 01:31:37,620
Here's a demonstration from Junior

3396
01:31:30,780 --> 01:31:33,770
Alright, got it, wish me good luck

3397
01:31:34,320 --> 01:31:35,740
I wonder if I can do it

3398
01:31:35,830 --> 01:31:37,140
Start the sound, please!

3399
01:31:37,330 --> 01:31:38,000
Okay, genius

3400
01:31:40,400 --> 01:31:41,260
Six!

3401
01:31:43,400 --> 01:31:44,460
Three!

3402
01:31:46,780 --> 01:31:47,800
Seven!

3403
01:31:49,970 --> 01:31:50,870
Three!

3404
01:31:52,980 --> 01:31:54,570
Eight!

3405
01:31:53,980 --> 01:31:54,460
Oh!

3406
01:31:54,730 --> 01:31:56,370
What just happened over there?

3407
01:31:58,540 --> 01:32:00,280
I told the staff to do like 2 or 3 of them, but they made me do 5 to 6!!

3408
01:32:00,280 --> 01:32:03,810
I told the staff to do like 2 or 3 of them, but they made me do 5 to 6!!

3409
01:32:03,820 --> 01:32:04,630
Downto--

3410
01:32:04,630 --> 01:32:08,610
And so it was decided: this game will be a Downtown match

3411
01:32:04,630 --> 01:32:11,740
Fujimon

3412
01:32:04,630 --> 01:32:11,740

3413
01:32:04,630 --> 01:32:11,740

3414
01:32:04,630 --> 01:32:11,740
Miyasako

3415
01:32:09,110 --> 01:32:10,810
The one leading the match

3416
01:32:10,800 --> 01:32:13,170
Will be Hamada-san, from Team Miyasako

3417
01:32:13,170 --> 01:32:14,480
Go get 'em!

3418
01:32:15,290 --> 01:32:16,270
Arithmetic Prince!

3419
01:32:16,490 --> 01:32:18,800
Never heard of that before

3420
01:32:18,820 --> 01:32:21,700
I am hoping that he does so well, it becomes an endless round

3421
01:32:20,770 --> 01:32:22,070
Okay, okay, okay, OKAY!

3422
01:32:22,130 --> 01:32:24,390
All right we're doing it, Two-Handed Arithmetic

3423
01:32:24,390 --> 01:32:26,460
Hamada's challenge starts now!

3424
01:32:35,040 --> 01:32:35,660
Five!

3425
01:32:39,210 --> 01:32:39,390
Scary!

3426
01:32:39,410 --> 01:32:39,630
Scary!

3427
01:32:39,660 --> 01:32:39,860
Scary!

3428
01:32:39,890 --> 01:32:40,240
Scary!

3429
01:32:40,720 --> 01:32:42,320
Scary!

3430
01:32:40,980 --> 01:32:42,320
Scary!

3431
01:32:41,280 --> 01:32:42,320
Scary!

3432
01:32:42,320 --> 01:32:43,490
Scary!

3433
01:32:42,590 --> 01:32:43,490
Scary!

3434
01:32:42,890 --> 01:32:43,490
Scary!

3435
01:32:43,120 --> 01:32:43,490
Scary!

3436
01:32:43,490 --> 01:32:45,720
5 is what I said and did!

3437
01:32:45,720 --> 01:32:48,290
"5 is what I said and did", he says

3438
01:32:47,290 --> 01:32:48,290
but 6 is what he did!

3439
01:32:50,090 --> 01:32:51,230
Five, man!

3440
01:32:51,530 --> 01:32:53,560
Your voice saying "5" was so small too

3441
01:32:53,960 --> 01:32:54,930
Let me do it again

3442
01:32:54,930 --> 01:32:55,630
One more try!

3443
01:32:56,220 --> 01:32:59,270
But really, what the hell is this?

3444
01:32:57,680 --> 01:32:59,270
You should start with your fists!

3445
01:32:59,270 --> 01:33:00,440
I just wanted to move 'em!

3446
01:32:59,270 --> 01:33:00,550
Just like this

3447
01:33:00,440 --> 01:33:02,390
I wanted to move my hands freely

3448
01:33:00,690 --> 01:33:02,270
So you can just do this

3449
01:33:02,390 --> 01:33:03,270
Like this?

3450
01:33:02,980 --> 01:33:03,410
Yeah

3451
01:33:03,410 --> 01:33:05,340
Why does he get to try again?

3452
01:33:05,420 --> 01:33:06,040
No, no

3453
01:33:06,040 --> 01:33:06,740
This is an exception

3454
01:33:06,740 --> 01:33:07,430
This is an exception

3455
01:33:07,430 --> 01:33:08,610
It was the first round

3456
01:33:09,110 --> 01:33:11,980
I guess it would be a waste to have the game ending like this

3457
01:33:10,530 --> 01:33:11,980
Alright, let's go

3458
01:33:12,050 --> 01:33:14,920
Hamada's second Two-Handed Arithmetic challenge!

3459
01:33:13,070 --> 01:33:14,000
Okay, okay!

3460
01:33:17,650 --> 01:33:18,950
Can he make it?

3461
01:33:23,440 --> 01:33:25,160
Five!

3462
01:33:28,290 --> 01:33:30,210
Out, out, out, out, out!

3463
01:33:30,260 --> 01:33:30,850
OUT!

3464
01:33:30,340 --> 01:33:31,100
Scary!

3465
01:33:30,810 --> 01:33:31,910
That's just wrong!

3466
01:33:32,050 --> 01:33:33,280
That was terrible!

3467
01:33:34,580 --> 01:33:35,330
Why?!

3468
01:33:35,340 --> 01:33:36,310
Why that?!

3469
01:33:36,890 --> 01:33:38,060
What's wrong with you?

3470
01:33:37,860 --> 01:33:38,760
I put up 5 fingers

3471
01:33:38,400 --> 01:33:39,070
Wait up

3472
01:33:39,210 --> 01:33:39,360
Why the hell are you coming near me?!

3473
01:33:39,280 --> 01:33:39,370
Why the hell are you coming near me?!

3474
01:33:39,310 --> 01:33:39,410
Why the hell are you coming near me?!

3475
01:33:39,340 --> 01:33:39,440
Why the hell are you coming near me?!

3476
01:33:39,380 --> 01:33:39,470
Why the hell are you coming near me?!

3477
01:33:39,410 --> 01:33:39,510
Why the hell are you coming near me?!

3478
01:33:39,440 --> 01:33:39,540
Why the hell are you coming near me?!

3479
01:33:39,480 --> 01:33:39,580
Why the hell are you coming near me?!

3480
01:33:39,510 --> 01:33:39,590
Why the hell are you coming near me?!

3481
01:33:39,540 --> 01:33:39,660
Why the hell are you coming near me?!

3482
01:33:39,580 --> 01:33:39,690
Why the hell are you coming near me?!

3483
01:33:39,610 --> 01:33:39,720
Why the hell are you coming near me?!

3484
01:33:39,640 --> 01:33:42,880
Why the hell are you coming near me?!

3485
01:33:41,570 --> 01:33:42,880
I put out the 5!

3486
01:33:42,980 --> 01:33:47,620
At this point I think we should say

3487
01:33:44,080 --> 01:33:47,620
this is Downtown's loss

3488
01:33:47,620 --> 01:33:50,250
Come on, show us one round

3489
01:33:49,250 --> 01:33:51,040
Come on, I don't want to lose too

3490
01:33:50,250 --> 01:33:51,990
Downtown's failure can be avoided, come here and

3491
01:33:51,990 --> 01:33:55,460
Downtown's failure can be avoided, come here and

3492
01:33:51,990 --> 01:33:55,460
show us what you can do, Matsumoto-san!

3493
01:33:53,310 --> 01:33:54,640
I'm not him after all

3494
01:33:54,250 --> 01:33:54,640
Yep!

3495
01:33:54,700 --> 01:33:55,490
He's ready

3496
01:33:55,900 --> 01:33:56,790
Come on!

3497
01:33:58,130 --> 01:34:01,830
You can't stop him

3498
01:33:59,330 --> 01:34:01,150
And now it's time for Team Fujimon

3499
01:34:01,150 --> 01:34:02,830
Here's Matsumoto's challenge!

3500
01:34:11,440 --> 01:34:13,170
Four!

3501
01:34:16,420 --> 01:34:17,440
That's not--

3502
01:34:17,710 --> 01:34:19,550
Your arithmetic is totally off

3503
01:34:19,550 --> 01:34:21,150
He's just an idiot

3504
01:34:21,820 --> 01:34:22,660
Are you a moron?

3505
01:34:22,790 --> 01:34:24,390
Just a plain idiot

3506
01:34:24,390 --> 01:34:24,750
I'm shocked

3507
01:34:24,750 --> 01:34:26,590
Shocked!

3508
01:34:26,590 --> 01:34:27,290
Electricity! It's the electricity from before

3509
01:34:27,290 --> 01:34:28,730
Electricity! It's the electricity from before

3510
01:34:28,730 --> 01:34:31,630
You weren't shocked

3511
01:34:30,060 --> 01:34:32,630
I have this great buildup of electricity here

3512
01:34:32,630 --> 01:34:34,500
It's still completely flowing in me!!

3513
01:34:32,980 --> 01:34:33,810
Four!

3514
01:34:34,500 --> 01:34:36,900
Downtown's complete loss!!

3515
01:34:35,150 --> 01:34:36,900
The buildup of electricity should not be underestimated

3516
01:34:38,840 --> 01:34:40,940
Let's stop getting the calculations wrong, please

3517
01:34:41,500 --> 01:34:43,810
Come on, can't you get a joke now?

3518
01:34:43,810 --> 01:34:46,260
Oh, so it was a joke!

3519
01:34:43,870 --> 01:34:46,780
Of course it's that

3520
01:34:46,240 --> 01:34:47,790
Thank you very much!

3521
01:34:47,500 --> 01:34:48,650
Now I see!

3522
01:34:48,670 --> 01:34:49,640
That was hard!

3523
01:34:49,700 --> 01:34:50,950
That was a nice joke

3524
01:34:49,910 --> 01:34:50,950
That was super hard!

3525
01:34:50,980 --> 01:34:51,550
It was a joke!!

3526
01:34:51,550 --> 01:34:54,080
A joke!!

3527
01:34:52,100 --> 01:34:53,340
Sorry for before

3528
01:34:54,080 --> 01:34:55,320
Have we really come to an era where

3529
01:34:55,320 --> 01:34:59,060
Have we really come to an era where

3530
01:34:57,290 --> 01:34:58,150
comedians don't get jokes anymore?

3531
01:34:58,150 --> 01:34:59,060
comedians don't get jokes anymore?

3532
01:34:59,080 --> 01:35:00,780
Sorry for that, we're sorry

3533
01:35:01,460 --> 01:35:03,190
I think they all got it by now!!

3534
01:35:03,380 --> 01:35:04,420
They got it, right?

3535
01:35:03,980 --> 01:35:05,610
They did, I'm sure of it

3536
01:35:04,660 --> 01:35:08,360
They got the fact it was just for laughs?

3537
01:35:06,260 --> 01:35:08,360
I'm sure they did!!

3538
01:35:08,400 --> 01:35:09,530
Here's Matsumoto's challenge

3539
01:35:10,450 --> 01:35:11,680
He went "four"!

3540
01:35:12,800 --> 01:35:13,550
He just said that

3541
01:35:18,050 --> 01:35:19,940
Two!

3542
01:35:20,510 --> 01:35:22,310
Seriously?

3543
01:35:21,580 --> 01:35:22,340
We're done

3544
01:35:22,450 --> 01:35:23,360
That's impossible

3545
01:35:23,230 --> 01:35:25,310
The end!!

3546
01:35:23,380 --> 01:35:25,310
That can't be!

3547
01:35:25,310 --> 01:35:26,210
Come on

3548
01:35:25,630 --> 01:35:26,340
You're terrible!

3549
01:35:26,270 --> 01:35:27,020
Terrible!

3550
01:35:27,020 --> 01:35:28,990
Looks like they're having a blast, though!

3551
01:35:29,550 --> 01:35:30,700
Look at them

3552
01:35:30,710 --> 01:35:32,370
Watch out for your mic

3553
01:35:32,390 --> 01:35:34,560
You've been flirting all the way!

3554
01:35:34,560 --> 01:35:35,160
Flirting here, flirting there

3555
01:35:35,160 --> 01:35:37,760
Flirting here, flirting there

3556
01:35:36,220 --> 01:35:37,760
What the hell

3557
01:35:37,760 --> 01:35:38,530
I used to respect you, what a waste of time!!

3558
01:35:38,530 --> 01:35:41,260
I used to respect you, what a waste of time!!

3559
01:35:42,570 --> 01:35:44,690
Even though the recreation is over

3560
01:35:44,820 --> 01:35:49,940
They bring up that disgraceful behavior they just saw

3561
01:35:50,220 --> 01:35:52,210
Are you for real about before?

3562
01:35:52,210 --> 01:35:53,190
Are you for real about before?

3563
01:35:53,230 --> 01:35:54,420
Yeah, right?

3564
01:35:54,440 --> 01:35:55,380
It's that we were kind of worried about you

3565
01:35:55,380 --> 01:35:56,910
It's that we were kind of worried about you

3566
01:35:56,910 --> 01:35:59,450
It's that we were kind of worried about you

3567
01:35:59,850 --> 01:36:03,350
Wasn't it obvious I was faking it?

3568
01:36:01,180 --> 01:36:03,350
For how long do you think we've been doing this?

3569
01:36:03,350 --> 01:36:05,560
It was on purpose!!

3570
01:36:05,560 --> 01:36:07,220
ON PURPOSE!!

3571
01:36:05,560 --> 01:36:07,220
ON PURPOSE!!

3572
01:36:14,460 --> 01:36:16,100
That was something

3573
01:36:20,060 --> 01:36:23,070
That was definitely not on purpose

3574
01:36:22,110 --> 01:36:23,080
It's true

3575
01:36:23,740 --> 01:36:26,080
I mean, you both yelled at me at the same time

3576
01:36:26,080 --> 01:36:29,810
It was an obvious thing to say

3577
01:36:27,410 --> 01:36:29,810
so of course it would be in unison

3578
01:36:29,980 --> 01:36:31,850
Still, I wonder if it's hard

3579
01:36:31,850 --> 01:36:34,120
I mean, I didn't try it so I really don't know

3580
01:36:34,120 --> 01:36:35,550
You see, if me and Hamada

3581
01:36:35,550 --> 01:36:41,060
Would have done it

3582
01:36:36,950 --> 01:36:38,490
the right way, smoothly,

3583
01:36:38,490 --> 01:36:41,060
the right way, smoothly, what use would it have?

3584
01:36:41,060 --> 01:36:42,220
They'd be like "That's Downtown for ya"

3585
01:36:42,220 --> 01:36:43,490
They'd be like "That's Downtown for ya"

3586
01:36:43,490 --> 01:36:46,320
"They're so smart" or such

3587
01:36:43,500 --> 01:36:45,270
That's not how it works

3588
01:36:45,420 --> 01:36:46,560
No way

3589
01:36:46,560 --> 01:36:49,130
For that, I'm going to be honest with you

3590
01:36:49,130 --> 01:36:50,170
When I got on stage, the staff was there

3591
01:36:50,170 --> 01:36:51,430
When I got on stage, the staff was there

3592
01:36:51,430 --> 01:36:54,440
And I swear Tadaki (staff) had

3593
01:36:52,400 --> 01:36:54,440
a face like he was about to cry

3594
01:36:54,440 --> 01:36:56,340
"Please do it", they said

3595
01:36:56,340 --> 01:36:58,770
"Do that thing you know"

3596
01:36:58,770 --> 01:37:01,940
I think it would have been nice if you'd do it right at least once

3597
01:37:01,100 --> 01:37:02,030
I see

3598
01:37:01,940 --> 01:37:03,250
Well, the first round was a little too funny

3599
01:37:03,250 --> 01:37:04,680
Well, the first round was a little too funny

3600
01:37:04,680 --> 01:37:06,380
If by the second round, I suddenly knew how to do it right

3601
01:37:06,380 --> 01:37:07,780
Then my first round attempt would end up looking so fake

3602
01:37:07,780 --> 01:37:08,890
Then my first round attempt would end up looking so fake

3603
01:37:08,890 --> 01:37:12,420
So when it goes that way, you just have to

3604
01:37:10,650 --> 01:37:12,420
do it again, on every round, till the end

3605
01:37:12,420 --> 01:37:14,820
'Cause at that point you can only do that

3606
01:37:15,090 --> 01:37:15,820
You just have to play the clown until the very end

3607
01:37:15,820 --> 01:37:18,290
You just have to play the clown until the very end

3608
01:37:18,880 --> 01:37:23,900
That's just my natural clowning abli-- ability!

3609
01:37:21,930 --> 01:37:23,900
Fufu

3610
01:37:26,220 --> 01:37:28,060
What the hell are you talking about?

3611
01:37:31,810 --> 01:37:32,910
I guess if you did it to stay true to the role of your inner clown

3612
01:37:32,910 --> 01:37:36,410
I guess if you did it to stay true to the role of your inner clown

3613
01:37:34,640 --> 01:37:36,410
I guess what you did is very cool

3614
01:37:36,640 --> 01:37:39,080
How about I do it seriously just for one round?

3615
01:37:39,080 --> 01:37:44,790
Will you rest at ease if I show you just for once that

3616
01:37:41,750 --> 01:37:44,790
I can actually do it properly?

3617
01:37:43,220 --> 01:37:44,790
Oh yes, definitely

3618
01:37:45,250 --> 01:37:46,790
Ok then

3619
01:37:46,080 --> 01:37:47,060
Really?

3620
01:37:46,790 --> 01:37:48,930
Well, now we can't laugh, so...

3621
01:37:47,950 --> 01:37:48,980
That will do?

3622
01:37:49,190 --> 01:37:51,960
We can't laugh, okay?

3623
01:37:50,320 --> 01:37:51,030
Sure

3624
01:37:50,460 --> 01:37:51,040
I mean, here

3625
01:37:51,060 --> 01:37:51,600
Yeah

3626
01:37:51,300 --> 01:37:51,780
Yeah

3627
01:37:52,160 --> 01:37:54,300
Let's do it

3628
01:37:56,730 --> 01:37:58,570
Hmm

3629
01:37:59,120 --> 01:38:01,200
Eight!

3630
01:38:01,200 --> 01:38:03,310
Wasn't that too slow?

3631
01:38:06,090 --> 01:38:08,120
Hang on, wasn't that too slow?

3632
01:38:07,630 --> 01:38:09,730
Slow, slow! Way too slow!

3633
01:38:12,030 --> 01:38:15,170
I think that was... Way too slow

3634
01:38:12,880 --> 01:38:14,180
Slow, slow! Way too slow!

3635
01:38:14,180 --> 01:38:15,180
Slow, slow! Way too slow!

3636
01:38:30,590 --> 01:38:32,880
Come on, it's not that hard!

3637
01:38:31,410 --> 01:38:33,190
Wait, wait, I mean, that's not it

3638
01:38:33,360 --> 01:38:34,610
What just happened

3639
01:38:36,880 --> 01:38:37,990
It's that

3640
01:38:38,000 --> 01:38:40,750
It came out again from me, really

3641
01:38:40,750 --> 01:38:42,970
Don't you get it? It came out again

3642
01:38:42,970 --> 01:38:46,320
If we keep on doing it, the clown will come out again

3643
01:38:46,320 --> 01:38:48,280
That's just its nature

3644
01:38:48,910 --> 01:38:49,740
Of course

3645
01:38:51,550 --> 01:38:53,430
It is now 11:30 AM

3646
01:38:53,430 --> 01:38:56,330
It's been 3 hours and half since the beginning

3647
01:38:58,300 --> 01:38:58,930
Eh?

3648
01:38:59,340 --> 01:39:00,250

01:39:07,040 --> 01:39:10,140

3654

Oh me?

01:40:14,470 --> 01:40:15,500
You seem to have the most troubled aura

Pardon me

3703
01:40:19,640 --> 01:40:21,020
Excuse me

3704
01:40:22,110 --> 01:40:24,780
Please tell me your troubles

3705
01:40:25,150 --> 01:40:26,160
Ah...

3706
01:40:28,830 --> 01:40:29,980
Let's see...

3707
01:40:30,120 --> 01:40:31,620
Lately, I've kind of put on a little weight

3708
01:40:31,620 --> 01:40:34,390
Lately, I've kind of put on a little weight

3709
01:40:34,760 --> 01:40:38,290
Could you be more specific?

3710
01:40:37,530 --> 01:40:38,290
Oh

3711
01:40:38,380 --> 01:40:41,130
I haven't gotten enough exercise if that's what you mean?

3712
01:40:41,650 --> 01:40:44,130
So my body weight is too high...

3713
01:40:48,600 --> 01:40:49,440
It's okay, it's okay

3714
01:40:49,440 --> 01:40:50,740
It's okay, it's okay

3715
01:40:50,740 --> 01:40:53,240
You don't have to try so hard

3716
01:40:51,960 --> 01:40:53,690
You're adorable

3717
01:40:53,240 --> 01:40:57,350
You got divorced

3718
01:40:55,040 --> 01:40:57,350
and your mental state was tattered, but

3719
01:40:57,550 --> 01:41:00,280
You're doing your best, aren't you?

3720
01:40:59,060 --> 01:41:00,280
I wouldn't go that far-

3721
01:41:00,920 --> 01:41:02,690
You helped drain a pond for ZIP! and were so friendly

3722
01:41:00,920 --> 01:41:04,950
T/N: ZIP! is a morning news talk show on NTV.

3724
01:41:04,190 --> 01:41:05,870
That's true...

3725
01:41:04,950 --> 01:41:06,460
You affectionately drained a pond

3726
01:41:05,870 --> 01:41:07,470
You're taking care of me

3727
01:41:06,460 --> 01:41:08,290
You affectionately drained a pond

3728
01:41:07,470 --> 01:41:08,290
Thank you

3729
01:41:08,620 --> 01:41:16,130
Even though you thought "I've already cleared a pond"

3730
01:41:10,060 --> 01:41:10,530
A- A-

3731
01:41:10,530 --> 01:41:11,360
A- A-

3732
01:41:11,360 --> 01:41:12,160
you still went on ZIP! and were friendly

3733
01:41:12,160 --> 01:41:16,130
you still went on ZIP! and were friendly

3734
01:41:13,630 --> 01:41:16,130
I'm not sure if that's true...

3735
01:41:16,130 --> 01:41:21,740
Your job has basically been reduced

3736
01:41:16,930 --> 01:41:18,250
Yeah

3737
01:41:18,250 --> 01:41:21,740
to this pattern, but you still did it adequately, haven't you?

3738
01:41:20,140 --> 01:41:21,740
Well, not quite

3739
01:41:21,740 --> 01:41:27,310
He acts like he's comforting, but says insults

3740
01:41:22,030 --> 01:41:24,910
I have other work as well

3741
01:41:22,790 --> 01:41:24,910
He's subtly saying some horrible things

3742
01:41:24,910 --> 01:41:27,310
You can relax now

3743
01:41:28,810 --> 01:41:29,710
What's this?

3744
01:41:29,710 --> 01:41:30,860
Thank you very much. Ah!

3745
01:41:30,860 --> 01:41:32,480
Thank you very much. Ah!

3746
01:41:31,410 --> 01:41:32,480
KISS

3747
01:41:31,410 --> 01:41:32,480
KISS

3748
01:41:32,910 --> 01:41:34,520
He got a kiss

3749
01:41:36,390 --> 01:41:38,220
What is this crap?

3750
01:41:36,390 --> 01:41:41,620
Finally, a kiss to make it all better

3751
01:41:37,950 --> 01:41:40,020
What a weird world

3752
01:41:40,350 --> 01:41:41,620
Thank you so much

3753
01:41:41,620 --> 01:41:43,620
Thanks. Thank you

3754
01:41:43,470 --> 01:41:45,470
But why though?

3755
01:41:49,880 --> 01:41:51,700
Thank you very much, doctor

3756
01:41:51,700 --> 01:41:52,940
Hamada, why don't you take a seat

3757
01:41:52,380 --> 01:41:52,940
Oh?

3758
01:41:52,940 --> 01:41:55,470
Hamada, why don't you take a seat

3759
01:41:53,400 --> 01:41:55,470
I wonder what will happen now

3760
01:41:55,470 --> 01:41:57,450
This is scary

3761
01:41:56,620 --> 01:41:57,440
Yeah

3762
01:41:57,460 --> 01:41:59,810
This is really scary

3763
01:41:59,980 --> 01:42:02,680
Please tell me your troubles

3764
01:42:02,910 --> 01:42:04,110
Definitely, it's probably the amount of sleep I've been...

3765
01:42:04,110 --> 01:42:05,350
Definitely, it's probably the amount of sleep I've been...

3766
01:42:06,120 --> 01:42:07,780
STOP

3767
01:42:06,120 --> 01:42:07,780
STOP

3768
01:42:08,120 --> 01:42:09,290
Hamada, you've

3769
01:42:09,290 --> 01:42:12,860
been feeling the pressure too much haven't you?

3770
01:42:11,500 --> 01:42:12,870
Oh, that could be

3771
01:42:13,120 --> 01:42:15,020
Do you remember?

3772
01:42:15,020 --> 01:42:16,690
It was  23 years ago,back in 1995

3773
01:42:16,690 --> 01:42:18,560
It was 23 years ago, back in 1995

I've been looking for you Natsumi~

3784
01:42:36,810 --> 01:42:38,550

When I was sitting around at my parents' house,

4125
01:44:30,530 --> 01:44:32,460
my mother said to me, "Hey Hamburg Steak!

4126
01:44:30,530 --> 01:44:36,500
T/N: This comedian's name is Hamburg Steak. He inserts "Hamburg Steak" unnecessarily into his lines. The dish, Hamburg steak, is also known as Salisbury steak, not to be mistaken with hamburgers.

4127
01:44:32,470 --> 01:44:34,000
How long are you going to sit around?

4128
01:44:34,000 --> 01:44:35,500
Why don't you get a job already?

4129
01:44:35,500 --> 01:44:36,500
You're a Hamburg Steak, aren't you?"

4130
01:44:36,500 --> 01:44:37,770
Yes. An occupation (daily special) right?

4131
01:44:36,500 --> 01:44:40,270
T/N: "Teishoku" can mean an occupation or a daily special dish.

4132
01:44:37,770 --> 01:44:40,270
Yes. An occupation (daily special) right?

4133
01:44:40,270 --> 01:44:43,010

01:44:45,680 --> 01:44:47,540
Oh, this one?

01:44:47,660 --> 01:44:48,490

4153
01:45:07,360 --> 01:45:09,510
His master Tatekawa Danshi said

4154
01:45:08,130 --> 01:45:12,630
"Shiraku is my successor"

4155
01:45:09,510 --> 01:45:12,630

With 18 disciples, he is a great master of Rakugo

4159
01:45:13,330 --> 01:45:16,000
He now has 18 disciples studying under him

4160

Have you ever watched the Absolutely No Laughing series?

4163
01:45:22,860 --> 01:45:24,780
I have, on New Year's Eve

4164
01:45:24,780 --> 01:45:30,820
T/N: Kohaku Utagassen (singing battle) is the most popular show to watch on New Year's Eve. The Batsu is the second most popular after that.

4165
01:45:24,780 --> 01:45:30,820
When I watch the Kohaku Singing Battle

4166
01:45:27,350 --> 01:45:28,780
if there's a singer I don't like I watch this instead

4167
01:45:28,780 --> 01:45:30,820
if there's a singer I don't like I watch this instead

4168
01:45:31,120 --> 01:45:33,920
Downtown, for me, are great benefactors

4169
01:45:33,920 --> 01:45:35,740
Downtown, for me, are great benefactors

4170
01:45:36,460 --> 01:45:39,690
They're always coming out with new things on TV

4171
01:45:39,690 --> 01:45:41,630
Starting with their variety shows

4172
01:45:41,630 --> 01:45:45,670
Just by talking they stir things up with their cheekiness

4173
01:45:45,670 --> 01:45:52,910
When I appeared on a Downtown show there were lots of jokes and

4174
01:45:48,870 --> 01:45:51,370
it was a lot of fun and became less controversial

4175
01:45:51,370 --> 01:45:52,910
it was a lot of fun and became less controversial

4176
01:45:53,070 --> 01:45:54,980
Downtown is pretty respectable

4177
01:45:55,010 --> 01:45:59,980
About Tsukitei Hosei, what are your thoughts?

4178
01:45:56,830 --> 01:45:59,980
As a storyteller, he's my junior. At first-

4179
01:45:59,980 --> 01:46:05,650
The loser character was all he could portray, so

4180
01:46:02,950 --> 01:46:05,650
he seemed like a coward, trying to escape and do Rakugo instead

4181
01:46:06,290 --> 01:46:08,920
He really gave it his all, and learned a great deal

4182
01:46:09,040 --> 01:46:11,690
He has started to become a Rakugo storyteller in earnest

4183
01:46:12,060 --> 01:46:14,030
My opinion has changed a great deal

4184
01:46:14,950 --> 01:46:18,800
His name is well known, and his characters are cheerful

4185
01:46:17,600 --> 01:46:18,800
His name is well known, and his characters are cheerful

4186
01:46:23,540 --> 01:46:26,070
You really laughed at that, huh

4187
01:46:24,370 --> 01:46:25,470
That picture...

4188
01:46:25,470 --> 01:46:27,060
You would laugh there, right?

4189
01:46:27,060 --> 01:46:28,540
At least that's what you laughed at

4190
01:46:28,540 --> 01:46:30,810
You'd definitely laugh

4191
01:46:29,220 --> 01:46:30,810
No no, I just thought it's such a nice photo

4192
01:46:30,810 --> 01:46:33,610
The words are nice, though

4193
01:46:31,910 --> 01:46:33,610
That's not it

4194
01:46:34,120 --> 01:46:36,520
As soon as that photo came up I was done for, sorry

4195
01:46:37,420 --> 01:46:39,350
My opinion has changed a great deal

4196
01:46:39,350 --> 01:46:40,180
So, uh

4197
01:46:40,200 --> 01:46:44,270
His name is well known, and his characters are cheerful

4198
01:46:42,910 --> 01:46:44,270
His name is well known, and his characters are cheerful

4199
01:46:43,940 --> 01:46:49,730
His intentions are incredibly pure, so

4200
01:46:45,160 --> 01:46:47,290
He looks so freaking happy right there

4201
01:46:46,060 --> 01:46:49,730
compared to the Tokyo headliners who aren't selling, he's much better

4202
01:46:50,630 --> 01:46:52,530
In 10 or 20 years, he'll be able to make his living as a storyteller

4203
01:46:52,530 --> 01:46:55,540
In 10 or 20 years, he'll be able to make his living as a storyteller

4204
01:46:55,890 --> 01:46:58,740
Now, the real question

4205
01:46:58,740 --> 01:47:00,740
This is what we are referring to

4206
01:47:01,860 --> 01:47:04,380
I've seen a little bit of this

4207
01:47:04,650 --> 01:47:07,600
The Hamburg Steak Master, right?

4208
01:47:06,180 --> 01:47:06,980
Right

4209
01:47:07,970 --> 01:47:09,590
This sort of thing, well

4210
01:47:09,590 --> 01:47:13,020
Rude performances aren't something I'm accustomed to...

4211
01:47:13,020 --> 01:47:18,330
It relies on the punchline failing, but the real joke being what's said after

4212
01:47:18,630 --> 01:47:20,900
Tough, that's pretty tough

4213
01:47:21,170 --> 01:47:23,200
So is there any chance you could help us?

4214
01:47:23,200 --> 01:47:25,170
As the Hamburg Steak Master, would you perform for us?

4215
01:47:25,170 --> 01:47:29,270
As the Hamburg Steak Master, would you perform for us?

4216
01:47:27,060 --> 01:47:29,750
Ah, but what about his image

4217
01:47:29,750 --> 01:47:31,970
Definitely

4218
01:47:30,120 --> 01:47:31,970
Hamburg Steak...

4219
01:47:32,320 --> 01:47:34,310
Negotiation Complete

4220
01:47:34,690 --> 01:47:37,510
I'm coming in

4221
01:47:35,150 --> 01:47:37,520
Our next negotiation is with this person

4222
01:47:37,520 --> 01:47:38,380
Please have a seat

4223
01:47:38,510 --> 01:47:41,880
Sorry to take time from your busy schedule

4224
01:47:39,760 --> 01:47:41,880
Oh no, I'm not busy at all

4225
01:47:41,880 --> 01:47:44,320
Oh it's Kihara

4226
01:47:42,080 --> 01:47:44,550
Kihara Minoru

4227
01:47:44,690 --> 01:47:53,160
Regular weather forecaster

4228
01:47:44,720 --> 01:47:53,160
Regular weather forecaster

4229
01:47:45,140 --> 01:47:50,160
The famous weather forecaster for the weather segment on "News Every"

4230
01:47:50,170 --> 01:47:53,160
He has 32 years of experience as a forecaster

4231
01:47:53,240 --> 01:47:54,080
This leader in the world of weather forecasting negotiates the appearance!

4232
01:47:53,240 --> 01:47:57,770
This leader in the world of weather forecasting negotiates the appearance!

4233
01:47:57,800 --> 01:48:03,070
Have you ever worked with the 2 members of Downtown?

4234
01:48:01,870 --> 01:48:03,070
Not that I can recall

4235
01:48:03,070 --> 01:48:06,070
How do you feel about Cocorico? Your impressions

4236
01:48:08,140 --> 01:48:10,810
Cocorico is Tanaka and... Who is the other guy?

4237
01:48:10,810 --> 01:48:12,310
Cocorico is Tanaka and... Who is the other guy?

4238
01:48:12,310 --> 01:48:14,920
Cocorico is Tanaka and... Who is the other guy?

4239
01:48:26,090 --> 01:48:26,990
Stay strong... Otherwise this will never end

4240
01:48:26,990 --> 01:48:29,260
Stay strong... Otherwise this will never end

4241
01:48:29,430 --> 01:48:32,230
Now, the real question

4242
01:48:32,230 --> 01:48:36,070
So, the character called Hamburg Steak Master

4243
01:48:34,540 --> 01:48:37,810
Hamburg Steak Master was his name?

4244
01:48:36,080 --> 01:48:37,190
Yes

4245
01:48:37,860 --> 01:48:38,870
Hmm... I'm not sure, you know what I mean?

4246
01:48:38,870 --> 01:48:41,210
Hmm... I'm not sure, you know what I mean?

4247
01:48:39,860 --> 01:48:41,860
He's hesitant

4248
01:48:41,210 --> 01:48:43,880
Hmm... I'm not sure, you know what I mean?

4249
01:48:42,860 --> 01:48:44,680
That seems tough

4250
01:48:43,940 --> 01:48:47,110
I want to try, nonetheless

4251
01:48:47,110 --> 01:48:49,970
Not sure about these kinds of roles...

4252
01:48:47,540 --> 01:48:51,750
What is he going to do?

4253
01:48:47,630 --> 01:48:51,750
Negotiation Complete

4254
01:48:52,600 --> 01:48:55,920
Finally we negotiated with this person

4255
01:48:53,740 --> 01:48:55,920
Nice to meet you you

4256
01:48:54,570 --> 01:48:55,920
Thank you for coming out

4257
01:48:56,360 --> 01:48:57,960
No way!

It's Tosaka

4262
01:49:03,110 --> 01:49:09,340
Nicknamed
"Maro"

4263
01:49:03,110 --> 01:49:09,340
Previous NHK Announcer

4264
01:49:03,450 --> 01:49:09,340
Nicknamed "Maro", his role as announcer made him the face of the NHK

4265
01:49:09,500 --> 01:49:18,380
He resigned from the NHK and remains active

4266
01:49:09,500 --> 01:49:18,380
Tosaka Junichi negotiates the appearance!

4267
01:49:09,500 --> 01:49:18,380

This year he resigned from the NHK, but has continued working as a freelancer

4270
01:49:13,980 --> 01:49:18,380
We negotiate the appearance with Tosaka Junichi!

4271
01:49:18,380 --> 01:49:24,080
T/N: Wide Na Show is a variety show with Matsumoto as its regular commentator.

4272
01:49:18,380 --> 01:49:24,080
You and Matsumoto-san appeared on Wide Na Show together

4273
01:49:19,510 --> 01:49:20,380
Yes

4274
01:49:21,620 --> 01:49:23,300
That's right

4275
01:49:23,310 --> 01:49:24,090
Yes yes

4276
01:49:24,450 --> 01:49:27,490
Right next to me is where they sat him

4277
01:49:27,490 --> 01:49:29,060
Right next to me is where they sat him

4278
01:49:29,060 --> 01:49:33,160
He smelled good to be honest

4279
01:49:32,150 --> 01:49:33,810
What kind of smell?

4280
01:49:33,160 --> 01:49:34,800
Breath mints

4281
01:49:33,160 --> 01:49:37,730
T/N: Jintan is a specific brand of breath mints that are said to have medicinal qualities.

4282
01:49:35,230 --> 01:49:37,730
Breath mints

4283
01:49:35,230 --> 01:49:37,730
was what he smelled like

4284
01:49:37,900 --> 01:49:41,000
Now, the real question

4285
01:49:41,300 --> 01:49:43,900
Itoda-san...

4286
01:49:41,300 --> 01:49:43,900
T/N: Itoda Jun is Hamburg Steak Master's real name.

4287
01:49:42,440 --> 01:49:43,900
Yes?

4288
01:49:43,900 --> 01:49:47,440
Which of his characters do you know?

4289
01:49:46,140 --> 01:49:47,440
I don't know any

4290
01:49:47,580 --> 01:49:51,450
This character is called "Hamburg Steak Master"

4291
01:49:49,510 --> 01:49:51,510
He doesn't know any of this

4292
01:49:51,450 --> 01:49:53,450
Hamburg Steak Master?

4293
01:49:54,330 --> 01:49:59,190
This is a famous character isn't it?

4294
01:49:55,820 --> 01:49:59,190
Everyone knows him, it would seem

4295
01:49:59,990 --> 01:50:03,690
I'd be doing this in front of Downtown, right?

4296
01:50:03,690 --> 01:50:06,730
It's a little bit embarrassing, though...

4297
01:50:07,180 --> 01:50:11,070
I can't imagine myself doing this confidently

4298
01:50:08,330 --> 01:50:11,070
I can't imagine myself doing this confidently

4299

Oh wow

4302
01:50:14,050 --> 01:50:14,250
And consent to a performance?

4303
01:50:14,050 --> 01:50:14,250
And so, who will be dressed as Hamburg Steak Master

4304

To consent a performance in Hamburg Steak Master's costume?

4308

What?

4312

This is hard

4313
01:50:24,130 --> 01:50:26,670
I think...

4314
01:50:26,670 --> 01:50:28,050
None of them

4315
01:50:28,570 --> 01:50:30,350
No one does it?

4316
01:50:29,430 --> 01:50:30,350
For the first time

4317
01:50:30,350 --> 01:50:32,690
I guess that could happen too

4318
01:50:32,690 --> 01:50:36,020
You got a point, I can't picture them doing him

4319
01:50:36,940 --> 01:50:39,160

01:51:11,050 --> 01:51:11,960
I didn't expect it

4347
01:51:15,940 --> 01:51:18,070
What's wrong, did you forget me? It's me, it's me

4348
01:51:18,070 --> 01:51:18,870
What's wrong, did you forget me? It's me, it's me

01:51:27,420 --> 01:51:29,240
Are you kidding me?!

4354
01:51:29,240 --> 01:51:31,710
What's wrong? Have you forgotten about me?

4355
01:51:30,030 --> 01:51:31,710
That's embarrassing

4356
01:51:31,710 --> 01:51:33,470
It's me, fellas

4357
01:51:31,710 --> 01:51:35,620

01:51:33,470 --> 01:51:35,620
It's Tosaka-burg Steak!

4360
01:51:37,160 --> 01:51:37,990
And so...

4361
01:51:37,990 --> 01:51:41,290
A hot out-of-pan joke display

4362
01:51:37,990 --> 01:51:41,290
I have 100 grams of a steaming hot out-of-pan joke for ya

4363
01:51:41,790 --> 01:51:42,620
When I was first asked to take part in this show

4364
01:51:42,620 --> 01:51:47,900
When I was first asked to take part in this show

4365
01:51:45,330 --> 01:51:47,900
I promptly refused it

4366
01:51:47,900 --> 01:51:50,830
I mean, I had to stand here with Tosaka, you know

4367
01:51:50,830 --> 01:51:52,930
And why should a star from Rakugo be

4368
01:51:53,280 --> 01:51:58,570
Paired together with a sort of announcer guy who makes no sense

4369
01:51:56,170 --> 01:51:58,570
and forced to be standing next to him?

4370
01:51:58,570 --> 01:52:00,510
But there's a reason, actually

4371
01:52:00,290 --> 01:52:02,410
He kinda sucks

4372
01:52:00,510 --> 01:52:02,410
But there's a reason, actually

4373
01:52:02,410 --> 01:52:06,580
After all a connection is important

4374
01:52:08,150 --> 01:52:08,320
Shiraku Bu~~~rg Steak!!

4375
01:52:08,320 --> 01:52:12,350
Shiraku Bu~~~rg Steak!!

4376
01:52:12,350 --> 01:52:13,960
He surely can shout

4377
01:52:13,960 --> 01:52:15,320
Coming next, your Tosaka-burg Steak will

4378
01:52:15,320 --> 01:52:17,190
Coming next, your Tosaka-burg Steak will

4379
01:52:17,190 --> 01:52:21,000
Bring you a 200 grams hot out-of-pan joke on your table

4380
01:52:19,360 --> 01:52:21,000
Their voices are good

4381
01:52:21,300 --> 01:52:22,760
This year Udo-san, a colleague from NHK, quit his job, you know.

4382
01:52:22,760 --> 01:52:24,870
This year Udo-san, a colleague from NHK, quit his job, you know.

01:52:24,870 --> 01:52:32,770
This year Udo-san, a colleague from NHK, quit his job, you know.

4384
01:52:27,370 --> 01:52:28,200
Because he got promoted as News Zero's new chairman, you know

4385
01:52:28,200 --> 01:52:29,810
Because he got promoted as News Zero's new chairman, you know

4386
01:52:29,810 --> 01:52:32,770
Because he got promoted as News Zero's new chairman, you know

4387
01:52:30,770 --> 01:52:32,770
That's right

4388
01:52:32,770 --> 01:52:34,440
You know, last month an offer from NTV came to me as well

4389
01:52:34,440 --> 01:52:37,080
You know, last month an offer from NTV came to me as well

4390
01:52:37,080 --> 01:52:39,750
And I thought "I wonder which news show could it be?"

4391
01:52:40,180 --> 01:52:41,060
And it was this huge variety show in

4392
01:52:41,060 --> 01:52:47,020
And it was this huge variety show in

4393
01:52:42,320 --> 01:52:47,020
which I was forced to impersonate a comedian and shout, just that

4394
01:52:57,930 --> 01:52:59,880
Are you kidding me?

4395
01:52:57,930 --> 01:53:06,210
Tosaka-burg Steak forgets his joke

4396
01:53:00,440 --> 01:53:03,970
He's only saying insults

4397
01:53:00,440 --> 01:53:03,970
Put it all together, man!

4398
01:53:04,370 --> 01:53:06,210
He asked Shiraku for help

4399
01:53:04,370 --> 01:53:09,610
Yeah that... Was amazing

4400
01:53:08,140 --> 01:53:09,610
I'm all for the meat

4401
01:53:10,640 --> 01:53:10,810
Tosaka Bu~~~rg Steak!!

4402
01:53:10,810 --> 01:53:13,980
Tosaka Bu~~~rg Steak!!

4403
01:53:12,680 --> 01:53:13,980
I didn't understand it!!

4404
01:53:13,250 --> 01:53:17,690
Makes no sense, I have no idea

4405
01:53:14,050 --> 01:53:14,210
Shiraku Bu~~~rg Steak!!

4406
01:53:14,210 --> 01:53:16,080
Shiraku Bu~~~rg Steak!!

4407
01:53:18,650 --> 01:53:21,020
That was awful, man!!

4408
01:53:22,420 --> 01:53:25,590
Don't do that "I got em!" gesture, that's not it!!

4409
01:53:24,330 --> 01:53:25,590
Thanks for coming

4410
01:53:27,960 --> 01:53:31,200
Right at the climax

4411
01:53:28,860 --> 01:53:31,200
He slipped right at the punchline

4412
01:53:31,200 --> 01:53:33,920
He skipped it

4413
01:53:32,280 --> 01:53:33,920
Yes, he did skip over it

4414
01:53:37,910 --> 01:53:39,780
He felt embarrassed too...

4415
01:53:39,780 --> 01:53:41,610
Man that was though

4416
01:53:41,610 --> 01:53:45,480
If Shiraku-han wasn't there with him it would have suck

4417
01:53:41,610 --> 01:53:45,480
T/N: The "-han" suffix is the Kansai dialect version of "-san".

4418
01:53:42,980 --> 01:53:45,480
Yeah, you're right

4419
01:53:44,260 --> 01:53:45,480
It'd be terrible

4420
01:53:45,480 --> 01:53:46,510
I mean, they were also doing this antagonism play...

4421
01:53:46,510 --> 01:53:49,320
I mean, they were also doing this antagonism play...

4422
01:53:47,250 --> 01:53:49,320
Yeah, that's right

4423
01:53:49,550 --> 01:53:54,760
(Hosei's) photo really made me laugh...

4424
01:53:54,760 --> 01:53:57,330
It's been 10 years (since you became a rakugoka), yes?

4425
01:53:54,760 --> 01:53:57,330
T/N: Rakugoka means Rakugo storyteller.

4426
01:53:55,660 --> 01:53:57,330
10 years, yes

4427
01:53:57,330 --> 01:53:58,190
I think that

4428
01:53:58,190 --> 01:54:00,660
You should turn bald quicker, it's for the best

4429
01:54:00,660 --> 01:54:01,900
I think that way you'll look more rakugoka-ish!!

4430
01:54:01,900 --> 01:54:04,730
I think that way you'll look more rakugoka-ish!!

4431
01:54:03,130 --> 01:54:05,900
Well yeah, that's probably right

4432
01:54:05,900 --> 01:54:08,500
You're not concerned at all about it?

4433
01:54:07,190 --> 01:54:08,500
Nah, I'm not

4434
01:54:08,500 --> 01:54:13,310
Hosei doesn't mind he's going bald

4435
01:54:08,510 --> 01:54:10,740
You don't mind it?

4436
01:54:09,900 --> 01:54:10,740
I don't

4437
01:54:11,380 --> 01:54:13,310
Tanaka you're... doing your best

4438
01:54:13,310 --> 01:54:14,880
I am, yes

4439
01:54:14,880 --> 01:54:15,780
When you were young---

4440
01:54:15,780 --> 01:54:17,050
Quit that!!

4441
01:54:17,710 --> 01:54:20,280
You always do that...

4442
01:54:22,420 --> 01:54:26,520
Are you doing it (hair restoration) or such?

4443
01:54:23,520 --> 01:54:26,520
I tried something like RiUP some time ago

4444
01:54:23,520 --> 01:54:26,520
T/N: RiUp is a hair restoration product.

4445
01:54:26,520 --> 01:54:28,630
Yama-chan should try that RiUP thing

4446
01:54:28,990 --> 01:54:32,600
Well, I'm actually doing it now!!

4447
01:54:30,530 --> 01:54:32,600
Wha-?

4448
01:54:33,380 --> 01:54:35,400
He set a trap

4449
01:54:35,400 --> 01:54:37,800
Of course you'd laugh

4450
01:54:37,800 --> 01:54:40,300
It's cause I said I didn't care

4451
01:54:38,560 --> 01:54:40,300
What are you saying?!

4452
01:54:42,670 --> 01:54:44,370
(Hair restoration) you're doing it?

4453
01:54:44,370 --> 01:54:45,810
But he just said before

4454
01:54:45,810 --> 01:54:46,810
Something like "I want to become bald quickly", he said it!

4455
01:54:46,810 --> 01:54:49,950
Something like "I want to become bald quickly", he said it!

4456
01:54:49,390 --> 01:54:50,580
Well, well, well

4457
01:54:50,580 --> 01:54:52,680
I'm like whatever happens, happens

4458
01:54:52,680 --> 01:54:54,750
But just to be sure I'm trying it

4459
01:54:54,750 --> 01:54:55,780
How long have you...?

4460
01:54:55,780 --> 01:54:58,090
For how many months or years now?

4461
01:54:56,690 --> 01:54:58,070
I don't know that

4462
01:54:58,400 --> 01:55:00,150
I guess it's been a year

4463
01:55:00,150 --> 01:55:05,590
Hosei is 100% into it

4464
01:55:03,330 --> 01:55:05,590
This is so confusing

4465
01:55:04,130 --> 01:55:05,590
Which side are you on?

4466
01:55:05,590 --> 01:55:08,330
One year?

4467
01:55:06,350 --> 01:55:08,330
He's so determined about it

4468
01:55:08,330 --> 01:55:10,170
I had no idea

4469
01:55:10,170 --> 01:55:13,000
Well, my wife is buying them so I can't just let 'em be

4470
01:55:13,000 --> 01:55:14,470
Well, my wife is buying them so I can't just let 'em be

4471
01:55:14,640 --> 01:55:18,910
If I don't use them, she gets mad at me

4472
01:55:16,460 --> 01:55:22,140
So I'm using them because she went all the way to the store to buy it

4473
01:55:17,550 --> 01:55:22,140
Sounds like a desperate effort

4474
01:55:22,690 --> 01:55:24,100
And then

4475
01:55:24,100 --> 01:55:25,380
Once again...

4476
01:55:28,020 --> 01:55:29,820
Appearance OK Derby

4477
01:55:28,680 --> 01:55:31,750
Appearance OK

4478
01:55:28,680 --> 01:55:31,750
Derby

4479
01:55:29,820 --> 01:55:31,750
Special episode

4480
01:55:29,820 --> 01:55:31,760
Special episode

4481
01:55:32,170 --> 01:55:32,490
This time it's not a performance negotiation from our TV show

4482
01:55:32,170 --> 01:55:37,620
This time it's not a performance negotiation from our TV show

4483
01:55:32,320 --> 01:55:35,940
This time it's not a negotiation started from our show

4484
01:55:35,940 --> 01:55:38,460
But it's a burning desire of appearing in No Laughing

4485
01:55:38,460 --> 01:55:42,130
A reverse-offer which came from a certain person!

4486
01:55:38,730 --> 01:55:39,260
He reached out for "No Laughing": a reverse offer!

4487
01:55:38,730 --> 01:55:42,130
He reached out for "No Laughing": a reverse offer!

4488
01:55:40,680 --> 01:55:43,110
Is that so?

4489
01:55:42,250 --> 01:55:42,410
Who will this person be!?

4490
01:55:42,410 --> 01:55:45,270
Who will this person be!?

4491
01:55:45,730 --> 01:55:47,340
Excuse me

4492
01:55:47,340 --> 01:55:48,340
It's a pleasure to meet you

4493
01:55:48,170 --> 01:55:51,020
My pleasure

4494
01:55:49,800 --> 01:55:51,040
Are you for real?!

4495
01:55:51,340 --> 01:55:54,480
Hirotada Ototake

His 1998 released essay

4503
01:55:56,700 --> 01:55:59,090
about his own introspection

4504
01:55:59,090 --> 01:56:00,480
titled "Limbs Dissatisfaction",

4505
01:56:00,480 --> 01:56:01,100
A huge best seller!!

Commentator

4512
01:56:05,240 --> 01:56:09,040
Educator

4513
01:56:05,340 --> 01:56:08,820
A commentator, a sports writer, an educator

4514
01:56:08,820 --> 01:56:10,880
Ototake, a man of various faces,

4515
01:56:09,640 --> 01:56:09,790
Longing for an appearance

4516
01:56:09,790 --> 01:56:14,000
Longing for an appearance

4517
01:56:10,880 --> 01:56:14,000
said he was longing for an appearance on our show!

4518
01:56:14,030 --> 01:56:17,470
Every year there's a fixed theme, isn't that right?

4519
01:56:17,470 --> 01:56:19,100
And whenever I watch them

4520
01:56:19,100 --> 01:56:22,000
I always think "What if it was me!!?" or such

4521
01:56:22,000 --> 01:56:24,370
For instance, on the Airport special there was this baggage turntable

4522
01:56:24,370 --> 01:56:27,940
For instance, on the Airport special there was this baggage turntable

4523
01:56:27,940 --> 01:56:34,250
I thought it'd be funny if I was on it, expressionless

4524
01:56:31,420 --> 01:56:34,260
I always think about stuff like this

4525
01:56:33,880 --> 01:56:36,650
Are you kidding me?

4526
01:56:34,260 --> 01:56:35,450
You met Matsumoto-san on the set of Wide Na Show, right?

4527
01:56:35,450 --> 01:56:38,350
You met Matsumoto-san on the set of Wide Na Show, right?

4528
01:56:36,190 --> 01:56:38,350
Yes, I did

4529
01:56:38,820 --> 01:56:49,000
You can say he's shy or so

4530
01:56:40,420 --> 01:56:42,360
but even when he's not on air he's always considerate of others

4531
01:56:42,360 --> 01:56:49,000
but even when he's not on air he's always considerate of others

4532
01:56:49,500 --> 01:56:52,030
And what about Hamada-san?

4533
01:56:50,700 --> 01:56:52,030
On the contrary, he...

4534
01:56:52,030 --> 01:56:54,840
He always strikes at anyone

4535
01:56:54,840 --> 01:56:57,870
And I think that's brave after all, considering the era we live in

4536
01:56:57,870 --> 01:56:59,340
And I think that's brave after all, considering the era we live in

4537
01:56:59,340 --> 01:57:00,580
In a way

4538
01:57:00,580 --> 01:57:02,680
He doesn't discriminate anyone, and hits us all alike

4539
01:57:02,680 --> 01:57:04,410
He doesn't discriminate anyone, and hits us all alike

4540
01:57:04,410 --> 01:57:04,880
And in a way I'm grateful to him for it

4541
01:57:04,880 --> 01:57:08,150
And in a way I'm grateful to him for it

4542
01:57:08,330 --> 01:57:08,500
Now, here's the real question

4543
01:57:08,500 --> 01:57:10,690
Now, here's the real question

4544
01:57:10,690 --> 01:57:15,460
Which is the disguise Ototake is wishing to appear as?

4545
01:57:10,820 --> 01:57:15,460
The disguise Ototake took into consideration is―

4546
01:57:15,460 --> 01:57:18,020
I was thinking about this...

4547
01:57:17,900 --> 01:57:20,380
What's that?

4548
01:57:19,190 --> 01:57:21,360
I think this skit will be challenging for them!!

4549
01:57:20,380 --> 01:57:23,470
He brought his own

4550
01:57:21,360 --> 01:57:23,470
I think this skit will be challenging for them!!

4551
01:57:23,770 --> 01:57:26,600
There's one thing I'm thinking about

4552
01:57:26,610 --> 01:57:27,270
For example

4553
01:57:27,270 --> 01:57:32,570
Saito from the comedy duo "Trendy Angel" is

4554
01:57:29,870 --> 01:57:32,570
making his lack of hair his main joke material

4555
01:57:32,570 --> 01:57:34,210
Or even fat comedians joking about their build and such

4556
01:57:34,210 --> 01:57:37,110
Or even fat comedians joking about their build and such

4557
01:57:37,110 --> 01:57:41,180
But for people with disabilities, this kind of gag feels immoral

4558
01:57:41,180 --> 01:57:43,720
But for people with disabilities, this kind of gag feels immoral

4559
01:57:43,720 --> 01:57:45,620
That's what they say, but I'm more like

4560
01:57:45,620 --> 01:57:48,660
"That's a barrier we need to cross over", like this

4561
01:57:48,660 --> 01:57:51,590
And I think nobody can let me fulfill this wish but this TV show!!

4562
01:57:51,590 --> 01:57:54,000
And I think nobody can let me fulfill this wish but this TV show!!

4563
01:57:54,000 --> 01:57:55,300
So let's do it!

4564
01:57:54,180 --> 01:57:54,350
Ototake dreamed of a certain costume, but which one is it!?

4565
01:57:54,350 --> 01:58:01,170
Ototake dreamed of a certain costume, but which one is it!?

4566
01:57:55,300 --> 01:57:58,930
And so, Ototake dreamed of a certain disguise

4567
01:57:57,500 --> 01:58:00,050
Man, what will it be?

4568
01:57:58,930 --> 01:58:01,170
But which one will it be?

4569
01:58:00,050 --> 01:58:01,170
I wonder what...

4570
01:58:01,170 --> 01:58:05,040
Matsumoto: please answer within 5 seconds

4571
01:58:01,230 --> 01:58:01,440
Matsumoto: please answer within 5 seconds!

4572
01:58:01,440 --> 01:58:05,040
Matsumoto: please answer within 5 seconds!

4573
01:58:02,110 --> 01:58:05,040
What? I don't get it, what was it?

4574
01:58:06,080 --> 01:58:07,840
You have to guess his disguise

4575
01:58:08,240 --> 01:58:10,080
Takamori Saigo

4576
01:58:09,170 --> 01:58:10,080
I have no idea

4577
01:58:10,260 --> 01:58:10,490
And the correct disguise is!? The answer's appearing next!!

4578
01:58:10,260 --> 01:58:10,490
And the correct disguise is!? The answer's appearing next!!

4579
01:58:10,490 --> 01:58:11,240
And the correct disguise is!? The answer's appearing next!!

4580
01:58:10,490 --> 01:58:16,020
And the correct disguise is!? The answer's appearing next!!

4581
01:58:10,770 --> 01:58:12,830
What will the correct answer be?

4582
01:58:10,930 --> 01:58:14,150
How should I know it?

4583
01:58:12,830 --> 01:58:16,020
Find out as he makes his entrance!

4584
01:58:16,020 --> 01:58:16,850
Isn't the bar being raised a bit too much?

4585
01:58:16,850 --> 01:58:19,090
Isn't the bar being raised a bit too much?

4586
01:58:18,030 --> 01:58:19,090
It is

4587
01:58:19,290 --> 01:58:21,220
I can hear a sound

4588
01:58:29,630 --> 01:58:31,700
This isn't fair, come on!!

4589
01:58:33,220 --> 01:58:35,070
For real, come on

4590
01:58:35,070 --> 01:58:38,440
An unexpected Ototake-robot

4591
01:58:35,070 --> 01:58:38,440
This is not good!

4592
01:58:38,440 --> 01:58:40,660
Alright, I got it

4593
01:58:41,910 --> 01:58:43,580
How could have I guessed it?!

4594
01:58:44,050 --> 01:58:45,650
It's R2-D2

4595
01:58:45,140 --> 01:58:47,280
It's him

4596
01:58:45,650 --> 01:58:47,280
R2-D2, huh

4597
01:58:47,280 --> 01:58:48,350
He chose R2...

4598
01:58:48,350 --> 01:58:50,220
He's laughing so much!!

4599
01:58:50,220 --> 01:58:52,690
That's a whole-face smile, really

4600
01:58:52,690 --> 01:58:54,790
Amazing... unexpected

4601
01:58:54,790 --> 01:58:55,620
It would have been weirder if I guessed it

4602
01:58:55,620 --> 01:58:57,890
It would have been weirder if I guessed it

4603
01:58:56,380 --> 01:58:57,890
I think you're right

4604
01:58:58,630 --> 01:59:00,660
Why is he smiling that much?

4605
01:58:59,790 --> 01:59:00,660
Really...

4606
01:59:01,100 --> 01:59:02,460
He's enjoying this a lot

4607
01:59:02,000 --> 01:59:03,800
It's 'cause he chose it himself

4608
01:59:02,950 --> 01:59:03,110
Waaaaaaaao!!

4609
01:59:03,110 --> 01:59:05,000
Waaaaaaaao!!

4610
01:59:05,000 --> 01:59:08,270
A shriek towards Matsumoto

4611
01:59:10,800 --> 01:59:12,970
What is this person doing?

4612
01:59:12,970 --> 01:59:16,540
He really looks happy, though

4613
01:59:15,070 --> 01:59:16,540
Yeah, he's having a blast

4614
01:59:16,540 --> 01:59:22,300
I guess if you take his face off is just a regular R2-D2

4615
01:59:20,000 --> 01:59:22,300
I guess so, yeah

4616
01:59:24,000 --> 01:59:24,170
Waaaaaaoo!!

4617
01:59:24,170 --> 01:59:26,490
Waaaaaaoo!!

4618
01:59:25,700 --> 01:59:28,600
That's so dumb

4619
01:59:26,490 --> 01:59:30,020
A shriek for Hamada too

4620
01:59:31,290 --> 01:59:33,060
That's... of course you'd laugh

4621
01:59:31,300 --> 01:59:33,060
You can't do that face to me, come on!!

4622
01:59:33,630 --> 01:59:35,160
He looked at you directly

4623
01:59:38,210 --> 01:59:41,040
Yeah he did it before too, that's it

4624
01:59:41,040 --> 01:59:45,370
Ototake-robot's wish is granted: he leaves

4625
01:59:45,370 --> 01:59:48,280
Come on, this was too much...

4626
01:59:49,730 --> 01:59:51,760
It's now 12:30

4627
01:59:50,030 --> 01:59:54,220
4 and a half hours since their research institute work began

4628
01:59:51,760 --> 01:59:55,940
A hard mission is about to be announced to them

4629
01:59:55,940 --> 01:59:59,060
I bet all these appearance fees must be good...

4630
01:59:59,060 --> 02:00:00,990
How are you doing?

4631
02:00:00,990 --> 02:00:01,890
Starting from now

4632
02:00:01,890 --> 02:00:06,890
You'll face Omame Archaeology Institute's treasured

4633
02:00:05,360 --> 02:00:06,890
special training for a while

4634
02:00:06,890 --> 02:00:08,030
Eh!?

4635
02:00:08,030 --> 02:00:09,570
It's a training meant to

4636
02:00:09,570 --> 02:00:11,390
Strengthen your stamina and teamwork

4637
02:00:11,390 --> 02:00:12,800
Which is essential for research

4638
02:00:13,170 --> 02:00:15,470
Everyone, get ready and let's go

4639
02:00:15,470 --> 02:00:16,070
Everyone, get ready and let's go

4640
02:00:16,240 --> 02:00:23,040
Basic stamina and teamwork reinforcement

4641
02:00:16,240 --> 02:00:23,040
Omame Archaeology Institute's special training participation

4642
02:00:19,470 --> 02:00:21,740
We're here, here comes

4643
02:00:23,040 --> 02:00:24,210
Of course it's here, it came, it came!!

4644
02:00:23,040 --> 02:00:26,110
T/N: Matsumoto is doing an imitation of the Nippon Elektel Rengo's joke, where they say, "You can't do that! No, no!"

4645
02:00:24,210 --> 02:00:24,480
Of course it's here, it came, it came!!

4646
02:00:24,480 --> 02:00:26,110
Of course it's here, it came, it came!!

4647
02:00:26,510 --> 02:00:27,650
I don't like! No, no!!

4648
02:00:27,650 --> 02:00:27,950
I don't like! No, no!!

4649
02:00:27,950 --> 02:00:29,950
I don't like! No, no!!

4650
02:00:30,140 --> 02:00:31,230
Welp

4651
02:00:33,350 --> 02:00:34,210
Here we go

4652
02:00:37,790 --> 02:00:41,640
They get on the bus to go to the special training

4653
02:00:42,140 --> 02:00:43,040
For the 5, a new battle's curtains open

4654
02:00:42,140 --> 02:00:49,930
For the 5, a new battle's curtains open

4655
02:00:44,040 --> 02:00:45,910
For the five comedians

4656
02:00:45,910 --> 02:00:48,960
The curtains open on a new battle

4657
02:00:51,250 --> 02:00:53,300
However

4658
02:00:51,820 --> 02:00:53,300
This is great weather

4659
02:00:52,670 --> 02:00:56,640
The ride to the training center is treacherous!!

4660
02:00:52,680 --> 02:00:56,640
The ride to the training center is treacherous!!

4661
02:00:53,300 --> 02:00:55,700
The journey is difficult

4662
02:00:55,700 --> 02:00:58,920
Of course, it couldn't be a simple trip

4663
02:00:59,560 --> 02:01:00,310
Is that it?

4664
02:01:00,310 --> 02:01:02,710
We've stopped...

4665
02:01:01,890 --> 02:01:02,710
What now?

4666
02:01:02,710 --> 02:01:05,950
Arrived at a bus stop

4667
02:01:03,480 --> 02:01:04,410
Arrived at a bus stop

4668
02:01:06,560 --> 02:01:07,550
We've stopped, huh

4669
02:01:07,550 --> 02:01:08,580
We've stopped

4670
02:01:10,180 --> 02:01:14,970
Here we go... Oh, it's pretty empty

4671
02:01:12,190 --> 02:01:16,420
High School Girl

4672
02:01:12,190 --> 02:01:16,420
Ryuji Akiyama

4673
02:01:18,430 --> 02:01:23,030
It's so unreliable.

4674
02:01:19,630 --> 02:01:23,030
Yesterday, it was completely packed around this time

4675
02:01:24,970 --> 02:01:27,200
Oh, but she's so slow

4676
02:01:27,200 --> 02:01:28,640
Hey, hurry up! The bus is going to leave soon!

4677
02:01:28,640 --> 02:01:31,140
Hey, hurry up! The bus is going to leave soon!

4678
02:01:30,600 --> 02:01:31,920
Sorry, I'm here now, sorry

4679
02:01:31,910 --> 02:01:36,440
Hana Sugisaki

4680
02:01:31,910 --> 02:01:36,440
High School Girl

4681
02:01:31,910 --> 02:01:36,440
T/N: Hana Sugisaki is an actress who debuted in films/shows like the live-action version of Bleach, Boys Over Flowers 2, and more.

4682
02:01:32,490 --> 02:01:34,310
Sorry

4683
02:01:34,320 --> 02:01:35,230
You barely made it

4684
02:01:35,230 --> 02:01:36,440
Sorry

4685
02:01:36,440 --> 02:01:37,750
But...

4686
02:01:37,750 --> 02:01:39,880
Hana, are you nervous?

4687
02:01:38,810 --> 02:01:40,810
Of course I am!

4688
02:01:40,820 --> 02:01:46,190
Today is what we've been dreaming of-

4689
02:01:43,020 --> 02:01:46,190
The Amagasaki opera company auditions, right?

4690
02:01:45,140 --> 02:01:45,650
Right?

4691
02:01:45,650 --> 02:01:46,190
Right?

4692
02:01:46,190 --> 02:01:49,560
Of course you're nervous~

4693
02:01:48,940 --> 02:01:49,560
Uh-huh

4694
02:01:49,560 --> 02:01:52,380
Speaking of which, should we practice for our audition?

4695
02:01:49,560 --> 02:01:55,960
Auditioning for the Amagasaki opera company

4696
02:01:49,560 --> 02:01:55,960
Auditioning for the Amagasaki opera company

4697
02:01:49,560 --> 02:01:55,960
The high school girls' dream

The high school girls' dream

4699
02:01:52,380 --> 02:01:53,130
Can we?

4700
02:01:53,130 --> 02:01:55,960
The Amagasaki audition is different than normal groups

4701
02:01:55,960 --> 02:01:58,400
They don't ask you any questions, see

4702
02:01:58,400 --> 02:02:01,640
The things you're asked are already pre-determined

4703

I don't remember

4742
02:02:58,380 --> 02:02:59,760
That's good, but more...

4743
02:02:59,760 --> 02:03:03,030
The second part was a little too serious

4744
02:03:01,380 --> 02:03:02,780

4758
02:03:12,270 --> 02:03:14,040
T/N: His actual name is Akiyama Ryuuji, but since he's acting as a female student at an elite arts high school, he has taken on a very extravagant and effeminate name.

T/N: Electric bath meaning a bath with a weak electric current. Apparently, it's used for health reasons, but it's not scientifically proven.

Stallone, huh

4790
02:04:14,380 --> 02:04:17,090
Yeah, that's him

4791
02:04:16,490 --> 02:04:18,840
That's so old!

4792
02:04:17,090 --> 02:04:18,840
Another Stallone movie...

4793
02:04:18,840 --> 02:04:21,280
Stallone is their favorite I guess

4794
02:04:19,740 --> 02:04:21,280
Do you think that will impress them?

4795
02:04:21,180 --> 02:04:24,290
Yeah

4796
02:04:21,280 --> 02:04:22,680
I like it, but

4797
02:04:22,680 --> 02:04:25,010
When I think about it, the first half was a little too serious

4798
02:04:24,290 --> 02:04:26,350
They really like Stallone

4799
02:04:25,280 --> 02:04:27,650
I think that was probably pretty good

4800
02:04:26,560 --> 02:04:28,330
It was definitely better that time

4801
02:04:28,330 --> 02:04:30,720
What's most important, of course

4802
02:04:30,720 --> 02:04:33,640
You have time to perform freely, so what do you do?

4803
02:04:32,350 --> 02:04:38,330
Amagasaki opera company audition

4804
02:04:32,350 --> 02:04:38,330
Performing freely is most important

4805
02:04:33,640 --> 02:04:34,960
Yeah, I know

4806
02:04:34,960 --> 02:04:36,290
Will you be okay with that?

4807
02:04:36,290 --> 02:04:38,330
Well, I've been thinking I'd play-

4808
02:04:38,330 --> 02:04:41,360
A Hollywood actress winning an academy award

4809
02:04:41,360 --> 02:04:46,070
A Hollywood actress winning an academy award

4810
02:04:42,900 --> 02:04:44,980
A Hollywood actress winning an academy award?

4811
02:04:44,980 --> 02:04:46,070
I don't really get it, but

4812
02:04:46,070 --> 02:04:48,070
Do you want to practice?

4813
02:04:46,880 --> 02:04:47,500
Could I?

4814
02:04:47,500 --> 02:04:49,500
I'll be the interviewer

4815
02:04:48,790 --> 02:04:49,500
Got it

4816
02:05:14,710 --> 02:05:16,710
That pisses me off

4817
02:05:17,630 --> 02:05:19,820
What the hell

4818
02:05:18,000 --> 02:05:27,670
Hana Sugisaki's Free Performance

4819
02:05:18,000 --> 02:05:27,670
T/N: Yuriyan Retriever is a comedian who does skits where she acts as an English speaking woman who is too full of emotions to properly speak and ends up saying awkward things.

4820
02:05:18,000 --> 02:05:27,670
Yuriyan Retriever's award ceremony bit

4821
02:05:19,820 --> 02:05:20,830
She's doing Yuriyan?

4822
02:05:20,820 --> 02:05:22,890
That's totally Yuriyan

4823
02:05:22,000 --> 02:05:25,780
My favorite movie is "Back to the Future"

4824
02:05:42,210 --> 02:05:44,290
I'll just say it

4825
02:05:49,480 --> 02:05:55,270
Tanaka's casual outfits are so tacky

4826
02:06:00,370 --> 02:06:06,050
No matter what Hosei tries in his rakugo, doesn't make me laugh

4827
02:06:05,130 --> 02:06:07,130
That's right! That's right

4828
02:06:10,330 --> 02:06:18,260
Even though Endo is a dumbass who lost a fortune on Bitcoin

4829
02:06:15,710 --> 02:06:18,830
I did not lose that much

4830
02:06:18,830 --> 02:06:20,830
"Even though he's a dumbass"

4831
02:06:21,340 --> 02:06:22,930
She's talking shit...

4832
02:06:27,180 --> 02:06:35,210
Lately Hamada always has a grain of rice stuck on his sleeve

4833
02:06:32,190 --> 02:06:34,190
He has for a while now

4834
02:06:41,410 --> 02:06:46,120
Matsumoto always gets in a bad mood when the air is too dry

4835
02:06:46,000 --> 02:06:47,490
So bad

4836
02:06:51,560 --> 02:06:53,070
Amazing

4837
02:06:52,580 --> 02:06:53,860
Yeah!

4838
02:06:53,070 --> 02:06:53,860
Great job

4839
02:06:53,860 --> 02:06:55,960
I think that will work pretty well

4840
02:06:55,280 --> 02:06:56,580
How the hell would it?

4841
02:06:57,730 --> 02:06:59,730
Your Hollywood actress-

4842
02:06:59,730 --> 02:07:01,730
was a pretty good impression

4843
02:07:02,400 --> 02:07:03,800
What did you come up with?

4844
02:07:03,800 --> 02:07:05,560
So for my performance, uh, well

4845
02:07:05,560 --> 02:07:06,240
So for my performance, uh, well

4846
02:07:06,240 --> 02:07:06,560
So for my performance, uh, well

4847
02:07:06,560 --> 02:07:08,890
I think that it all comes down to facial expressions

4848
02:07:08,890 --> 02:07:10,310
So I want to show off my faces

4849
02:07:10,310 --> 02:07:12,060
How would you do that?

4850
02:07:12,060 --> 02:07:13,950
Let me show you

4851
02:07:12,650 --> 02:07:13,950
Oh, okay

4852
02:07:13,950 --> 02:07:17,950
The "I really want to say something" expression

4853
02:07:34,500 --> 02:07:36,870
Say it already!

4854
02:07:36,870 --> 02:07:38,870
Come on

4855
02:07:39,270 --> 02:07:42,040
Does this kind of person exist?

4856
02:07:47,010 --> 02:07:49,250
Just talk already, jeez...

4857
02:07:48,000 --> 02:07:49,250
That's right

4858
02:07:49,250 --> 02:07:51,250
Just let the words out

4859
02:07:53,250 --> 02:07:55,450
Yeah, I do see those expressions

4860
02:07:54,150 --> 02:07:55,450
Good, right?

4861
02:07:55,440 --> 02:07:56,590
That was a bad one!

4862
02:07:56,590 --> 02:07:58,660
Everyone in the audition room will all be watching, so...

4863
02:07:58,660 --> 02:08:02,460
Hana, you should have an act that relies on facial expressions.

4864
02:08:00,330 --> 02:08:02,460
You should keep one in your repertoire

4865
02:08:01,390 --> 02:08:02,460
Facial expression...

4866
02:08:02,460 --> 02:08:03,930
So, like

4867
02:08:03,930 --> 02:08:05,630
The face you make when you get home-

4868
02:08:05,630 --> 02:08:07,630
and there's a random corpse on the floor?

4869
02:08:07,630 --> 02:08:09,320
Ah, that's a great scene

4870
02:08:07,630 --> 02:08:15,380
Hana Sugisaki's expression performance

4871
02:08:07,630 --> 02:08:15,380
When she got home, there was a corpse

4872
02:08:09,320 --> 02:08:11,740
So right in front of you here

4873
02:08:11,740 --> 02:08:12,920
You just saw a corpse

4874
02:08:12,920 --> 02:08:14,410
So, go ahead and show us

4875
02:08:14,410 --> 02:08:15,380
Is that okay?

4876
02:08:15,880 --> 02:08:16,960
Let's see

4877
02:08:19,050 --> 02:08:21,370
NOOOOOOOOO!!

4878
02:08:22,470 --> 02:08:24,220
Awesome

4879
02:08:24,220 --> 02:08:27,350
The way she switched that on was great

4880
02:08:24,770 --> 02:08:27,350
That was funny

4881
02:08:27,350 --> 02:08:31,090
Didn't expect that

4882
02:08:27,350 --> 02:08:31,090
Oh boy what a twist

4883
02:08:27,350 --> 02:08:31,090
That really got me good

4884
02:08:27,350 --> 02:08:31,090
That was really good, wow

4885
02:08:30,610 --> 02:08:33,160
That was no good

4886
02:08:31,340 --> 02:08:32,650
You said it

4887
02:08:33,160 --> 02:08:35,000
Oh I see

4888
02:08:37,730 --> 02:08:40,440
She just flipped the switch and went right in

4889
02:08:40,440 --> 02:08:42,170
She just flipped the switch and went right in

4890
02:08:41,050 --> 02:08:42,170
What is this?

4891
02:08:43,310 --> 02:08:44,610
NOOOOOO!!

4892
02:08:46,270 --> 02:08:48,810
She's still going!

4893
02:08:47,750 --> 02:08:48,810
She kept going...

4894
02:08:48,810 --> 02:08:49,560
Yeah...

4895
02:08:49,560 --> 02:08:51,280
That's amazing

4896
02:08:50,290 --> 02:08:51,280
Yeah

4897
02:08:57,450 --> 02:08:58,080
Huh?

4898
02:09:02,260 --> 02:09:03,650
What?

4899
02:09:09,660 --> 02:09:10,970
This face is covered in so many wrinkles

4900
02:09:10,970 --> 02:09:14,440
This face is covered in so many wrinkles

4901
02:09:16,000 --> 02:09:18,870
A pug?

4902
02:09:19,020 --> 02:09:22,210
IT'S A DEMON PUG-MAN ISN'T IT!!

4903
02:09:21,620 --> 02:09:22,210
Why?

4904
02:09:22,210 --> 02:09:25,650
Stop, he's just a normal person

4905
02:09:24,930 --> 02:09:26,610
You can't do that to normal people

4906
02:09:27,160 --> 02:09:29,310
You can't be so forceful with their faces

4907
02:09:29,300 --> 02:09:30,750
Excuse us

4908
02:09:30,030 --> 02:09:31,750
He's a normal person

4909
02:09:30,750 --> 02:09:33,250
Yes, I'm so sorry

4910
02:09:33,550 --> 02:09:39,060
That performance was too realistic,

4911
02:09:35,160 --> 02:09:39,060
I'm so sorry

4912
02:09:37,810 --> 02:09:39,060
I went too real

4913
02:09:39,060 --> 02:09:43,800
Don't do that stuff during the audition!

4914
02:09:41,850 --> 02:09:43,800
You can't go and start a fight with people

4915
02:09:43,800 --> 02:09:58,770
T/N: It's labeled as "Gaki no Tsukai News" on the bottom right, but this is an actual commercials that advertise for a movie that Hana Sugisaki acts in and has nothing to do with Gaki or the Batsu. Sorry. In case you're interested, the movie is "12 Suicidal Teens".

02:09:59,300 --> 02:10:06,050
Training grounds arrival

4920
02:10:00,560 --> 02:10:02,420
The bus transporting the 5 comedians

4921
02:10:02,420 --> 02:10:06,050
Arrives at its destination - the training center

4922
02:10:07,200 --> 02:10:09,470
Omame Archaeological Institute

4923
02:10:07,640 --> 02:10:09,930
Ohhhh look at that

4924
02:10:09,470 --> 02:10:12,030
Hostage Rescue Training Center

4925
02:10:12,460 --> 02:10:19,770
THE CURTAINS OPEN ON A FIERCE BATTLE

4926
02:10:12,460 --> 02:10:19,770
THE CURTAINS OPEN ON A FIERCE BATTLE

4927
02:10:13,390 --> 02:10:15,460
With those Black Oni

4928
02:10:15,460 --> 02:10:18,530
The curtains open on a heroic battle

4929
02:10:20,270 --> 02:10:23,020
This is... Wow

4930
02:10:20,350 --> 02:10:24,810
Training Center Grounds

4931
02:10:20,750 --> 02:10:23,020
Ugh

4932
02:10:21,220 --> 02:10:23,020
Ack ack ack

4933
02:10:23,020 --> 02:10:24,800
It's sopping wet

4934
02:10:23,550 --> 02:10:24,800
It's muddy as heck

4935
02:10:23,550 --> 02:10:24,800
Why here?

4936
02:10:24,800 --> 02:10:26,990
Oh... No no no NO NOOO!

4937
02:10:25,190 --> 02:10:32,480
conditions are awful

4938
02:10:25,190 --> 02:10:32,480
Due to yesterday's rain

4939
02:10:26,890 --> 02:10:30,460
This is the worst

4940
02:10:27,520 --> 02:10:31,010
That was bad

4941
02:10:30,710 --> 02:10:32,710
There's something huge in there

4942
02:10:32,660 --> 02:10:33,510
Wait really?

4943
02:10:33,510 --> 02:10:35,080
Everybody good?

4944
02:10:35,080 --> 02:10:35,850
Now, the hostage rescue training will commence

4945
02:10:35,850 --> 02:10:37,990
Now, the hostage rescue training will commence

4946
02:10:38,100 --> 02:10:39,050
Yes

4947
02:10:39,050 --> 02:10:40,300
You can laugh, but,

4948
02:10:40,590 --> 02:10:48,900
But if a Black Oni catches you you'll receive a harsh punishment

4949
02:10:40,590 --> 02:10:48,900
During training laughing is OK

4950
02:10:40,590 --> 02:10:48,900
Hostage Rescue Training Rules

4951
02:10:45,140 --> 02:10:46,410
I don't get it

4952
02:10:46,180 --> 02:10:48,900
Also, if we do this with just these members,

4953
02:10:48,900 --> 02:10:50,800
that old man smell

4954
02:10:50,800 --> 02:10:52,870
you guys are spreading around will get to unbearable levels

4955
02:10:53,430 --> 02:10:56,200
A world-famous young man has-

4956
02:10:56,200 --> 02:10:58,140
come to help

4957
02:10:56,890 --> 02:10:58,370
World-famous?

4958
02:10:58,370 --> 02:10:59,120
Go ahead!

4959
02:11:05,650 --> 02:11:08,220
This guy's got some stamina!

4960
02:11:07,280 --> 02:11:08,210
That's right

4961
02:11:08,220 --> 02:11:09,600
He really is built

4962
02:11:08,220 --> 02:11:12,750
Inoue Naoya

4963
02:11:08,220 --> 02:11:12,750
Boxing World Champion

4964
02:11:10,150 --> 02:11:11,620
Glad he came!

4965
02:11:10,820 --> 02:11:11,620
Amazing!

4966
02:11:12,750 --> 02:11:18,760
Boxing three-weight world champion Inoue Naoya

4967
02:11:18,880 --> 02:11:23,160
While boxing at WBSS, the pinnacle of the boxing world,

4968
02:11:23,330 --> 02:11:29,200
He scored a KO in 70 seconds

4969
02:11:29,200 --> 02:11:33,110
He fights as a Japanese national treasure

4970
02:11:33,110 --> 02:11:35,110
Should you really be here?

4971
02:11:35,110 --> 02:11:36,340
Well, I told my manager,

4972
02:11:36,340 --> 02:11:38,060
I want to be on this show

4973
02:11:39,750 --> 02:11:42,950
But now isn't really the time to be doing this

4974
02:11:41,650 --> 02:11:42,950
Oh

4975
02:11:43,050 --> 02:11:45,550
This year's hostage will be Matsumoto

4976
02:11:45,550 --> 02:11:49,660
This year's hostage will be Matsumoto

4977
02:11:46,950 --> 02:11:49,490
Ah yes, of course that's right

4978
02:11:49,490 --> 02:11:50,670
Nothing has changed at all!

4979
02:11:50,670 --> 02:11:51,360
That's true

4980
02:11:51,510 --> 02:11:55,960
At the beginning, multiple Black Oni will appear

4981
02:11:56,030 --> 02:12:00,000
As time passes, they will multiply

4982
02:12:00,980 --> 02:12:02,500
To escape the Oni's punishments

4983
02:12:02,500 --> 02:12:05,210
Escape from the punishments

4984
02:12:05,370 --> 02:12:07,870
They set out to find the key to rescue Matsumoto

4985
02:12:08,680 --> 02:12:14,380
Absolutely Don't Get Caught

4986
02:12:09,010 --> 02:12:14,380
And now it begins - Absolutely Don't Get Caught Treasure Hunters!

4987
02:12:09,010 --> 02:12:14,380
Treasure Hunters

4988
02:12:14,380 --> 02:12:15,920
Ok, here we go

4989
02:12:15,920 --> 02:12:17,250
I'll never get used to this

4990
02:12:17,550 --> 02:12:20,250
Training START

4991
02:12:17,950 --> 02:12:20,700
That was exhausting...

4992
02:12:21,100 --> 02:12:25,960
Training Begins

4993
02:12:24,210 --> 02:12:26,760
Wait, we were still talking

4994
02:12:25,830 --> 02:12:27,090
Such incompetence

4995
02:12:25,960 --> 02:12:56,660
Sandal

4996
02:12:28,860 --> 02:12:31,630
Wow, they're fast

4997
02:12:30,310 --> 02:12:31,630
Be careful, be careful

4998
02:12:32,880 --> 02:12:36,540
Locked on to Inoue

4999
02:12:33,930 --> 02:12:36,140
He's going for it!

5000
02:12:34,200 --> 02:12:35,700
That's gonna hurt

5001
02:12:35,170 --> 02:12:36,540
He came out of nowhere

5002
02:12:36,570 --> 02:12:38,640
Ahahaha ahahaha

5003
02:12:38,640 --> 02:12:40,540
Ahahaha ahahaha

5004
02:12:39,110 --> 02:12:40,420
You sound so happy

5005
02:12:41,640 --> 02:12:44,810
That's fine, better than one of us getting it

5006
02:12:44,160 --> 02:12:45,180
I agree

5007
02:12:44,250 --> 02:12:45,510
Woooah incredible

5008
02:12:44,250 --> 02:12:47,250
Woooah incredible

5009
02:12:45,510 --> 02:12:47,250
Woooah incredible

5010
02:12:48,580 --> 02:12:52,350
Matsumoto spectates from his perch

5011
02:12:51,430 --> 02:12:52,350
It wasn't that elevated

5012
02:12:57,440 --> 02:13:00,860
HA! Hahahahaha!

5013
02:13:02,750 --> 02:13:05,070
Ha! Ha! Ha! Ha! Ha!

5014
02:13:04,580 --> 02:13:05,420
That's...

5015
02:13:05,800 --> 02:13:08,070
It's okay -  This is your baptism

5016
02:13:05,800 --> 02:13:08,070
It's okay -  This is your baptism

5017
02:13:08,070 --> 02:13:09,670
How did it feel? Taking that hit?

5018
02:13:08,970 --> 02:13:09,840
Good, good

5019
02:13:09,670 --> 02:13:10,710
How did it feel? Taking that hit?

5020
02:13:10,710 --> 02:13:13,640
That hurt and they were so fast

5021
02:13:12,010 --> 02:13:12,690
They're fast

5022
02:13:12,690 --> 02:13:13,290
They really are

5023
02:13:12,990 --> 02:13:13,640
Very fast

5024
02:13:13,640 --> 02:13:14,840
That was good though

5025
02:13:14,460 --> 02:13:15,590
Yeah, all of a sudden

5026
02:13:14,840 --> 02:13:15,660
That's wonderful

5027
02:13:15,660 --> 02:13:16,840
That's how it goes

5028
02:13:16,840 --> 02:13:20,820
The second Oni has appeared

5029
02:13:18,980 --> 02:13:20,000
Something's coming

5030
02:13:18,980 --> 02:13:20,000
What does it say?

5031
02:13:18,980 --> 02:13:20,000
What?

5032
02:13:20,000 --> 02:13:20,820
Megaphone

5033
02:13:20,830 --> 02:13:44,140
Megaphone

5034
02:13:20,950 --> 02:13:22,450
It's coming! It's coming it's coming

5035
02:13:22,950 --> 02:13:26,000
Hamada, clinging to Tanaka's arm

5036
02:13:28,420 --> 02:13:28,920
What? What are you doing?

5037
02:13:28,920 --> 02:13:30,060
What? What are you doing?

5038
02:13:30,060 --> 02:13:32,590
Come on

5039
02:13:34,960 --> 02:13:36,000
No waaaaay! Hey!!

5040
02:13:36,000 --> 02:13:38,010
No waaaaay! Hey!!

5041
02:13:48,370 --> 02:13:49,580
Are you okay?

5042
02:13:49,580 --> 02:13:50,540
You

5043
02:13:50,910 --> 02:13:51,580
Tanaka again?

5044
02:13:51,580 --> 02:13:52,750
That's not it

5045
02:13:52,750 --> 02:13:54,010
He used me as a meatshield!

5046
02:13:54,010 --> 02:13:55,250
Meatshield?

5047
02:13:54,710 --> 02:13:55,250
Meatshield

5048
02:13:55,250 --> 02:13:56,320
He used a person as a shield

5049
02:13:56,320 --> 02:13:57,490
I wouldn't do that...

5050
02:13:57,430 --> 02:13:58,700
Shield for each other

5051
02:13:57,490 --> 02:14:00,290
I thought we would run together but I just got caught

5052
02:14:00,290 --> 02:14:02,760
When the Megaphone came out, I ran

5053
02:14:02,760 --> 02:14:03,290
Suddenly, I felt my arm being grabbed

5054
02:14:03,290 --> 02:14:05,430
Suddenly, I felt my arm being grabbed

5055
02:14:04,840 --> 02:14:05,430
By whom?

5056
02:14:05,430 --> 02:14:07,460
It was Hamada-san!!

5057
02:14:08,800 --> 02:14:10,360
Would you please not do that this year?

5058
02:14:10,700 --> 02:14:12,630
Your body is that of a champion,

5059
02:14:12,630 --> 02:14:13,900
Your body is that of a champion,

5060
02:14:13,880 --> 02:14:14,400
Yeah

5061
02:14:14,400 --> 02:14:16,340
You have a solid build

5062
02:14:15,950 --> 02:14:17,250
Well yes, of course

5063
02:14:16,540 --> 02:14:18,510
Let's use him as a shield!

5064
02:14:17,440 --> 02:14:18,170
No no no

5065
02:14:19,170 --> 02:14:20,270
Let's not

5066
02:14:20,270 --> 02:14:21,240
That's no good

5067
02:14:21,240 --> 02:14:25,010
It'll be really bad for us if something goes wrong

5068
02:14:25,180 --> 02:14:28,980
The third Oni has appeared

5069
02:14:27,780 --> 02:14:28,950
Oh no oh no oh no oh no

5070
02:14:28,400 --> 02:14:30,320
What's written there?

5071
02:14:29,030 --> 02:14:29,970
Leathers, Leathers

5072
02:14:29,170 --> 02:14:33,890
T/N: It actually says, "Riders". In Japanese, that means a racing jacket, such as a leather motorcycle jacket.

5073
02:14:29,170 --> 02:14:55,580
Leathers

5074
02:14:36,690 --> 02:14:38,690
Wait, hold on

5075
02:14:38,690 --> 02:14:39,490
This is bad

5076
02:14:39,490 --> 02:14:42,560
What are you doing with this?

5077
02:14:42,660 --> 02:14:46,070
Leathers, Leathers huh

5078
02:14:42,860 --> 02:14:46,070
What does Leathers mean? What is it?

5079
02:14:46,220 --> 02:14:47,370
This is pretty bad

5080
02:14:54,670 --> 02:14:56,680
I'm glad mine wasn't that bad

5081
02:14:56,680 --> 02:14:58,310
That was quite the sound

5082
02:14:58,310 --> 02:14:59,750
That was really bad. Seriously.

5083
02:14:59,750 --> 02:15:01,120
That was really bad. Seriously.

5084
02:15:01,420 --> 02:15:03,280
Shouldn't we be treasure hunting? For the key!!

5085
02:15:02,880 --> 02:15:04,220
That's right, the key

5086
02:15:03,280 --> 02:15:04,220
Shouldn't we be treasure hunting? For the key!!

5087
02:15:04,350 --> 02:15:05,800
We should find the key

5088
02:15:04,850 --> 02:15:05,800
Shall we look?

5089
02:15:04,850 --> 02:15:05,800
What is this?

5090
02:15:05,800 --> 02:15:06,720
Yes, let's

5091
02:15:06,720 --> 02:15:13,690
10 minutes of training have passed, releasing Oni

5092
02:15:10,960 --> 02:15:13,690
Even more Oni have appeared

5093
02:15:13,860 --> 02:15:17,110
Searching the building

5094
02:15:14,030 --> 02:15:14,760
It's not here, huh

5095
02:15:14,760 --> 02:15:15,480
Is it not here?

5096
02:15:15,480 --> 02:15:17,600
I don't think so

5097
02:15:15,930 --> 02:15:16,660
Yeah

5098
02:15:17,330 --> 02:15:18,400
I can laugh, right?

5099
02:15:22,970 --> 02:15:25,440
Uwaaa!

5100
02:15:25,540 --> 02:15:26,390
I really don't want

5101
02:15:26,870 --> 02:15:27,720
It's no good!

5102
02:15:27,190 --> 02:15:28,140
What is this?

5103
02:15:27,620 --> 02:15:28,840
The champion got caught

5104
02:15:29,240 --> 02:15:30,760
This is his baptism

5105
02:15:29,340 --> 02:15:31,410
This is the one I didn't want to catch me the most

5106
02:15:31,380 --> 02:16:04,950
Dick Machine

5107
02:15:31,410 --> 02:15:33,850
The Dick Machine right?

5108
02:15:33,850 --> 02:15:35,850
It's the champion

5109
02:15:35,880 --> 02:15:38,390
Hahahahaha

5110
02:15:38,850 --> 02:15:40,920
This isn't the kind of champion I want to see

5111
02:15:40,950 --> 02:15:41,620
Really

5112
02:15:41,620 --> 02:15:42,090
Yeah

5113
02:15:42,490 --> 02:15:43,120
I'm glad it's not me

5114
02:15:42,490 --> 02:15:43,120
This is evil

5115
02:15:43,120 --> 02:15:43,960
This is super scary

5116
02:15:43,960 --> 02:15:44,730
This is really scary

5117
02:15:44,710 --> 02:15:47,730
I've never seen a champion do something like this

5118
02:15:47,730 --> 02:15:50,660
That's right, this kind of champ-

5119
02:15:52,570 --> 02:15:53,680
Let's give a countdown

5120
02:15:53,770 --> 02:15:54,500
Please do

5121
02:15:54,650 --> 02:15:55,280
Oh we're going

5122
02:15:55,380 --> 02:15:55,840
3

5123
02:15:55,840 --> 02:15:56,720
2

5124
02:15:57,290 --> 02:15:57,720
1

5125
02:15:58,190 --> 02:15:58,570
Go!

5126
02:16:00,560 --> 02:16:01,720
Wait wait

5127
02:16:01,370 --> 02:16:02,210
That has to hurt

5128
02:16:01,940 --> 02:16:03,690
That hit him at the base

5129
02:16:04,060 --> 02:16:05,430
That hurts

5130
02:16:04,410 --> 02:16:05,140
Hang on

5131
02:16:06,760 --> 02:16:07,500
Champion?

5132
02:16:11,050 --> 02:16:13,220
That's a low blow... A low blow...

5133
02:16:13,220 --> 02:16:15,370
That was pretty bad

5134
02:16:13,220 --> 02:16:17,760
Suddenly he's down for the count

5135
02:16:14,700 --> 02:16:16,940
The hardest part hit me

5136
02:16:16,460 --> 02:16:17,770
Give it a minute

5137
02:16:17,770 --> 02:16:18,830
Hahahaha

5138
02:16:20,760 --> 02:16:23,660
You were down for the count, huh

5139
02:16:21,640 --> 02:16:23,360
For a second

5140
02:16:21,640 --> 02:16:23,360
He was definitely down

5141
02:16:24,370 --> 02:16:26,530
Since Matsumoto is stuck in there

5142
02:16:26,530 --> 02:16:28,940
We should tell him we don't have the key yet

5143
02:16:27,680 --> 02:16:28,940
Good point

5144
02:16:27,680 --> 02:16:28,940
Let's go

5145
02:16:29,170 --> 02:16:32,370
Matsumoto-san, we don't have the key

5146
02:16:31,050 --> 02:16:31,890
We don't have it

5147
02:16:31,890 --> 02:16:32,540
We don't have it

5148
02:16:32,370 --> 02:16:34,640
Give me a break with this "we don't have it"

5149
02:16:33,590 --> 02:16:35,260
Sorry we don't have the key!

5150
02:16:35,260 --> 02:16:35,640
We don't

5151
02:16:35,640 --> 02:16:37,440
He's saying we should go home

5152
02:16:37,440 --> 02:16:40,450
An unnoticed Oni

5153
02:16:40,450 --> 02:16:41,900
That's good, that's good

5154
02:16:40,450 --> 02:16:42,620
He's saying we should go home, since we don't have the key

5155
02:16:42,620 --> 02:16:43,200
Everyone?

5156
02:16:43,070 --> 02:16:43,730
Yeah

5157
02:16:43,450 --> 02:16:44,620
Yeah, let's go, let's go

5158
02:16:44,620 --> 02:16:45,770
That's no good

5159
02:16:45,770 --> 02:16:47,170
"Everyone" being us

5160
02:16:46,490 --> 02:16:47,170
Sorry

5161
02:16:47,170 --> 02:16:47,490
Yes

5162
02:16:47,740 --> 02:16:50,720
The Oni is ignored

5163
02:16:50,720 --> 02:16:52,290
Without me?

5164
02:16:51,240 --> 02:16:53,280
That's why we asked

5165
02:16:52,740 --> 02:16:55,360
I didn't notice him either

5166
02:16:53,390 --> 02:16:57,100
The Oni is perplexed

5167
02:16:55,810 --> 02:16:58,580
What's with this guy?

5168
02:16:56,900 --> 02:16:58,580
We can't help

5169
02:16:56,900 --> 02:16:58,580
We don't have the key, though

5170
02:16:58,580 --> 02:17:00,830
You aren't thinking, you're just running in circles

5171
02:17:01,730 --> 02:17:03,600
Then you stand there and give up

5172
02:17:03,640 --> 02:17:06,740
He's running, he's running!

5173
02:17:06,970 --> 02:17:08,470
There, ah there it is

5174
02:17:08,810 --> 02:17:12,910
Wait a minute

5175
02:17:11,330 --> 02:17:12,900
When? When did he?

5176
02:17:12,910 --> 02:17:16,680
He was the only one that noticed, but stayed quiet

5177
02:17:14,830 --> 02:17:16,680
He saw him there first

5178
02:17:16,680 --> 02:17:18,700
You just discretely ran away

5179
02:17:17,790 --> 02:17:19,250
That's an awful setup

5180
02:17:19,250 --> 02:17:21,890
He stepped on my foot when he started running

5181
02:17:21,890 --> 02:17:25,220
Hosei stepping on the champion's foot

5182
02:17:21,890 --> 02:17:25,220
This is the worst

5183
02:17:25,370 --> 02:17:38,800
Top Star

5184
02:17:25,460 --> 02:17:28,230
What is "Top Star"?

5185
02:17:27,310 --> 02:17:28,110
Top Star?

5186
02:17:28,230 --> 02:17:28,740
Top Star

5187
02:17:28,740 --> 02:17:29,310
Right

5188
02:17:29,560 --> 02:17:30,130
He is such a dirty player

5189
02:17:30,130 --> 02:17:32,400
He is such a dirty player

5190
02:17:30,550 --> 02:17:32,400
Are you alright now?

5191
02:17:31,260 --> 02:17:32,400
I'm fine

5192
02:17:32,430 --> 02:17:33,530
What? Hang on...

5193
02:17:33,530 --> 02:17:35,040
What? Hang on...

5194
02:17:35,040 --> 02:17:36,170
What what what what

5195
02:17:40,510 --> 02:17:44,360
Ugh that scared me... Geez... Again, they're coming in...

5196
02:17:42,190 --> 02:19:40,360
TKO Kinoshita

5197
02:17:44,730 --> 02:17:46,510
I really hate this

5198
02:17:44,830 --> 02:17:46,510
Another one came

5199
02:17:46,580 --> 02:17:53,720
I've come to give you a quiz

5200
02:17:52,500 --> 02:17:53,720
Oh, is that so?

5201
02:17:53,720 --> 02:17:59,460
Tell me these people's names, please

5202
02:18:01,080 --> 02:18:02,450
This person...

5203
02:18:02,830 --> 02:18:06,570
I know this, it's uh... Tom Hanks!

5204
02:18:05,820 --> 02:18:07,350
Yeah

5205
02:18:06,570 --> 02:18:07,530
I know this, it's uh... Tom Hanks!

5206
02:18:06,570 --> 02:18:15,510
Tom
Hanks

5207
02:18:06,570 --> 02:18:15,510
m 0 0 l 0 -54 l 160 -54 l 160 0 l 0 0

5208
02:18:08,050 --> 02:18:10,700
I got that one really quickly

5209
02:18:09,690 --> 02:18:10,600
I have to write it?

5210
02:18:10,600 --> 02:18:11,560
Yes

5211
02:18:12,510 --> 02:18:14,140
There, Tom Hanks

5212
02:18:14,140 --> 02:18:15,490
Who is-

5213
02:18:16,030 --> 02:18:17,190
this person?

5214
02:18:17,530 --> 02:18:19,980
I know this...

5215
02:18:19,980 --> 02:18:21,280
Look

5216
02:18:20,250 --> 02:18:21,280
Look

5217
02:18:20,480 --> 02:18:21,280
Look

5218
02:18:20,750 --> 02:18:21,280
Look

5219
02:18:21,280 --> 02:18:22,070
Right? Uh...

5220
02:18:22,070 --> 02:18:23,150
Right? Uh...

5221
02:18:23,150 --> 02:18:25,920
Waaah Hang on

5222
02:18:23,780 --> 02:18:25,920
Waaah Hang on

5223
02:18:26,190 --> 02:18:29,860
He was in "Speed", right!!

5224
02:18:27,320 --> 02:18:28,090
Yes yes yes

5225
02:18:28,000 --> 02:18:29,260
Yeah yeah yeah yeah

5226
02:18:29,920 --> 02:18:31,320
It's coming to him

5227
02:18:30,560 --> 02:18:32,020
Look

5228
02:18:30,790 --> 02:18:32,020
Look

5229
02:18:31,030 --> 02:18:32,020
Look

5230
02:18:31,260 --> 02:18:32,020
Look

5231
02:18:32,040 --> 02:18:39,070
Matsumoto's recalling "Speed" is slow

5232
02:18:33,760 --> 02:18:36,110
Oh wait just- I'm sorry- hold on

5233
02:18:36,110 --> 02:18:37,610
Get it right

5234
02:18:37,610 --> 02:18:39,120
This is irritating

5235
02:18:39,370 --> 02:18:41,280
Who is this person?

5236
02:18:41,520 --> 02:18:46,110
That one... I totally don't remember

5237
02:18:48,740 --> 02:18:50,440
He's been in commercials, right?

5238
02:18:50,440 --> 02:18:52,450
But of course I don't remember-

5239
02:18:52,450 --> 02:18:53,880
HIS NAMEEEE!

5240
02:18:53,880 --> 02:18:56,250
Who is this person?

5241
02:18:55,320 --> 02:18:58,720
Oh that's! Uhhhh...

5242
02:18:57,180 --> 02:18:58,720
That's

5243
02:18:57,350 --> 02:18:58,720
That's

5244
02:18:57,520 --> 02:18:58,720
That's

5245
02:18:58,720 --> 02:19:01,490
From "Back to the Future", right?

5246
02:19:01,570 --> 02:19:02,690
It's uh...

5247
02:19:01,600 --> 02:19:03,870
These names aren't coming to him at all

5248
02:19:03,290 --> 02:19:04,190
Hey!

5249
02:19:03,460 --> 02:19:04,190
Hey!

5250
02:19:03,460 --> 02:19:04,860
This is awful

5251
02:19:03,620 --> 02:19:04,190
Hey!

5252
02:19:05,520 --> 02:19:08,040
He does that every time

5253
02:19:06,960 --> 02:19:10,930
Who the hell is that? This is pissing me off

5254
02:19:09,510 --> 02:19:10,680
This is cruel

5255
02:19:10,930 --> 02:19:12,900
Who is this person?

5256
02:19:12,670 --> 02:19:14,370
Oh that's whatshisface isn't it?

5257
02:19:14,370 --> 02:19:17,370
Uhh... Uhh...

5258
02:19:15,520 --> 02:19:17,370
Uhh... Uhh...

5259
02:19:17,490 --> 02:19:20,670
Hehehehe

5260
02:19:18,870 --> 02:19:20,970
He isn't get any of these

5261
02:19:20,690 --> 02:19:26,010
Matsumoto only answers with "look" and "that's"

5262
02:19:20,760 --> 02:19:21,810
None of them

5263
02:19:23,230 --> 02:19:25,160
Um...

5264
02:19:24,240 --> 02:19:26,010
This is great

5265
02:19:25,160 --> 02:19:26,010
He was

5266
02:19:26,010 --> 02:19:32,020
From "Titanic"... It's?

5267
02:19:28,050 --> 02:19:31,430
He knows that one, he just can't find the name

5268
02:19:28,830 --> 02:19:29,950
That's right

5269
02:19:32,620 --> 02:19:34,710
I wonder if I can do this

5270
02:19:34,170 --> 02:19:36,760
Oh, like when you blank on a test

5271
02:19:34,710 --> 02:19:36,110
Ah! I've got it!

5272
02:19:37,760 --> 02:19:39,180
Keanu Reeves

5273
02:19:37,760 --> 02:19:40,360
Keanu
Reeves

5274
02:19:37,760 --> 02:19:40,360
m 0 0 l 0 -54 l 160 -54 l 160 0 l 0 0

5275
02:19:40,360 --> 02:19:56,080
(Ki) Keanu
Reeves

5276
02:19:40,360 --> 02:19:56,080
Tom
Hanks

5277
02:19:40,360 --> 02:19:56,080
m 0 0 l 0 -54 l 160 -54 l 160 0 l 0 0

5278
02:19:40,360 --> 02:19:56,080
m 0 0 l 0 -54 l 160 -54 l 160 0 l 0 0

5279
02:19:40,410 --> 02:19:42,350
If you take the first 2 letters-

5280
02:19:42,510 --> 02:19:44,760
of each of their names-

5281
02:19:44,760 --> 02:19:47,180
you will decipher the code

5282
02:19:48,070 --> 02:19:49,700
Good luck~

5283
02:19:49,700 --> 02:19:50,940
TO, KI. TO, KI

5284
02:19:49,700 --> 02:19:52,940
T/N: Keanu in Japanese is spelled "Kianu", so it's "Ki".

5285
02:19:51,590 --> 02:19:52,940
I see, so

5286
02:19:52,940 --> 02:19:56,080
I might be able to do this based on the two I know

5287
02:19:56,240 --> 02:19:59,160
Searching the building

5288
02:19:56,510 --> 02:19:58,500
What about where we were before?

5289
02:19:58,630 --> 02:20:00,500
Probably back there-

5290
02:20:01,500 --> 02:20:03,030
It's Leathers!

5291
02:20:01,500 --> 02:20:31,410
Leathers

5292
02:20:03,130 --> 02:20:04,350
Come on come on come on

5293
02:20:03,230 --> 02:20:05,320
I thought so!

5294
02:20:05,000 --> 02:20:09,290
This one is so painful. Leathers really hurt

5295
02:20:06,320 --> 02:20:10,640
Crap! Crap! Crap! No, I can't do this!

5296
02:20:10,990 --> 02:20:12,790
Hold on

5297
02:20:12,340 --> 02:20:13,790
You look scared

5298
02:20:14,130 --> 02:20:15,130
Right?

5299
02:20:15,730 --> 02:20:19,100
I give up

5300
02:20:15,760 --> 02:20:17,130
It really hurts

5301
02:20:19,200 --> 02:20:19,980
That's gonna hurt

5302
02:20:19,980 --> 02:20:20,830
Yeah, it's gonna hurt

5303
02:20:25,090 --> 02:20:26,140
You got a two-fer!

5304
02:20:26,610 --> 02:20:28,940
It looks like he's saying "I'm sorry!"

5305
02:20:31,410 --> 02:20:32,550
He hit, he hit your head on the way back

5306
02:20:32,550 --> 02:20:34,310
He hit, he hit your head on the way back

5307
02:20:33,380 --> 02:20:35,160
It was like he was saying, "I'm sorry"

5308
02:20:34,330 --> 02:20:40,650
The unfortunate Tanaka

5309
02:20:35,550 --> 02:20:37,680
Ow, that hurt so bad

5310
02:20:37,650 --> 02:20:39,650
What a nice guy

5311
02:20:38,390 --> 02:20:40,650
That was so bad

5312
02:20:41,320 --> 02:20:43,860
He's that guy, uh...

5313
02:20:43,860 --> 02:20:44,660
AH!! I remember!

5314
02:20:44,660 --> 02:20:46,130
AH!! I remember!

5315
02:20:47,000 --> 02:20:49,200
There, Michael J. Fox

5316
02:20:47,590 --> 02:20:50,300
(Ma)

5317
02:20:47,590 --> 02:20:50,300
Michael J. Fox

5318
02:20:47,590 --> 02:20:50,300
T/N: In Japanese, his name is spelled, "Maikeru" so it starts with a "Ma".

5319
02:20:47,590 --> 02:20:50,300
m 0 0 l 0 -66 l 167 -66 l 168 0 l 0 0

5320
02:20:49,200 --> 02:20:50,600
Right?

5321
02:20:49,810 --> 02:20:52,570
You got it!

5322
02:20:50,510 --> 02:20:52,570
I told you

5323
02:20:51,760 --> 02:20:53,970
Why's this guy not coming to me though

5324
02:20:53,970 --> 02:20:57,540
They call him "something-sama" right?

5325
02:20:56,790 --> 02:20:58,000
Yep

5326
02:20:58,000 --> 02:21:00,170
I got something weird stuck in my head

5327
02:21:00,170 --> 02:21:04,280
I'm mixing him up with Yon-sama

5328
02:21:03,610 --> 02:21:05,610
That's it

5329
02:21:04,280 --> 02:21:06,810
It's like Yon-sama is covering him up

5330
02:21:04,280 --> 02:21:06,810
T/N: Yon-sama is the Japanese nickname for Bae Yong-joon, a very famous Korean drama actor.

5331
02:21:06,580 --> 02:21:08,580
Oh so "Re" is the last one?

5332
02:21:06,810 --> 02:21:14,350
Matsumoto fails to remember Leo-sama

5333
02:21:09,070 --> 02:21:14,350
Yon-sama

5334
02:21:09,070 --> 02:21:14,350
m 0 0 l 0 0 l 0 0 l 0 -9 l 21 -9 l 21 0 l 0 0

5335
02:21:11,430 --> 02:21:13,430
I'm being serious here

5336
02:21:14,350 --> 02:21:17,060
How about we all check the second floor again?

5337
02:21:17,060 --> 02:21:19,060
I think you're right

5338
02:21:17,740 --> 02:21:19,060
Right?

5339
02:21:20,010 --> 02:21:21,170
The Top Star!

5340
02:21:20,360 --> 02:21:25,760
After this, the Top Star appears!!

5341
02:21:20,360 --> 02:21:25,760
After this, the Top Star appears!!

5342
02:21:21,170 --> 02:21:23,870
There he is at last!

5343
02:21:26,300 --> 02:21:28,860
How about we all check the second floor again?

5344
02:21:28,860 --> 02:21:30,860
I think you're right

5345
02:21:29,660 --> 02:21:30,860
Right?

5346
02:21:32,110 --> 02:21:33,150
The Top Star!

5347
02:21:32,110 --> 02:21:35,340
A Top Star is born!

5348
02:21:33,150 --> 02:21:35,490
There he is at last!

5349
02:21:34,260 --> 02:21:36,240
Top Star?

5350
02:21:34,420 --> 02:21:36,420
I totally forgot about this

5351
02:21:35,490 --> 02:21:37,550
He really is a Top Star!

5352
02:21:37,950 --> 02:21:39,410
I am no Top Star!

5353
02:21:38,010 --> 02:21:39,680
I forgot this!

5354
02:21:39,410 --> 02:21:39,980
Woah, he's even got a bell attached

5355
02:21:39,980 --> 02:21:41,750
Woah, he's even got a bell attached

5356
02:21:40,360 --> 02:21:41,750
He finally showed up

5357
02:21:42,010 --> 02:21:43,920
Let's just run away together

5358
02:21:43,920 --> 02:21:45,290
All this will get in the way

5359
02:21:45,280 --> 02:21:47,050
What do you mean in the way? Help me!

5360
02:21:46,090 --> 02:21:47,050
It's a bother, no no

5361
02:21:47,050 --> 02:21:48,920
Impossible, we can't move together

5362
02:21:48,920 --> 02:21:51,090
Hold up, this...

5363
02:21:50,840 --> 02:21:52,840
The Top Star!

5364
02:21:51,090 --> 02:21:52,830
I'm begging you all!

5365
02:21:51,870 --> 02:21:52,830
Nope

5366
02:21:52,840 --> 02:21:53,130
Nuisance

5367
02:21:53,130 --> 02:21:53,790
Nuisance

5368
02:21:53,790 --> 02:21:55,280
Do your best!

5369
02:21:53,790 --> 02:21:56,960
That bell's ringing is gonna give us away

5370
02:21:55,280 --> 02:21:56,960
That's right

5371
02:21:55,700 --> 02:21:56,960
That's true, isn't it?

5372
02:21:59,930 --> 02:22:01,600
Could you look around for us? This way?

5373
02:22:01,600 --> 02:22:02,440
You say search...

5374
02:22:02,440 --> 02:22:03,700
Let's look together

5375
02:22:03,700 --> 02:22:03,720
Don't treat me differently!

5376
02:22:03,720 --> 02:22:03,740
Don't treat me differently!

5377
02:22:03,740 --> 02:22:03,750
Don't treat me differently!

5378
02:22:03,750 --> 02:22:03,750
Don't treat me differently!

5379
02:22:03,750 --> 02:22:03,770
Don't treat me differently!

5380
02:22:03,770 --> 02:22:03,790
Don't treat me differently!

5381
02:22:03,790 --> 02:22:03,800
Don't treat me differently!

5382
02:22:03,800 --> 02:22:03,820
Don't treat me differently!

5383
02:22:03,820 --> 02:22:03,840
Don't treat me differently!

5384
02:22:03,840 --> 02:22:03,850
Don't treat me differently!

5385
02:22:03,850 --> 02:22:03,870
Don't treat me differently!

5386
02:22:03,870 --> 02:22:03,890
Don't treat me differently!

5387
02:22:03,890 --> 02:22:03,900
Don't treat me differently!

5388
02:22:03,900 --> 02:22:03,920
Don't treat me differently!

5389
02:22:03,920 --> 02:22:03,940
Don't treat me differently!

5390
02:22:03,940 --> 02:22:03,950
Don't treat me differently!

5391
02:22:03,950 --> 02:22:03,970
Don't treat me differently!

5392
02:22:03,970 --> 02:22:05,310
Don't treat me differently!

5393
02:22:05,310 --> 02:22:08,110
I'm not anything special!

5394
02:22:07,860 --> 02:22:08,840
He's definitely special

5395
02:22:08,840 --> 02:22:10,750
Most definitely

5396
02:22:09,380 --> 02:22:13,510
A Top Star walking as if he is on a runway

5397
02:22:10,740 --> 02:22:13,510
Just let him say whatever

5398
02:22:13,510 --> 02:22:16,850
Let's head to the second floor

5399
02:22:13,940 --> 02:22:15,380
Alright

5400
02:22:17,320 --> 02:22:18,990
You're beautiful, Hosei-san

5401
02:22:18,990 --> 02:22:20,950
Oh you're right

5402
02:22:20,350 --> 02:22:22,060
Those feathers really are big

5403
02:22:20,950 --> 02:22:22,060
The light-

5404
02:22:22,060 --> 02:22:24,460
Oh wow the stairs really fit him right now

5405
02:22:24,460 --> 02:22:25,860
Could you? From the top?

5406
02:22:25,300 --> 02:22:26,740
Huh?

5407
02:22:27,060 --> 02:22:29,330
Feels like he wouldn't lose to the real thing

5408
02:22:28,860 --> 02:22:30,860
That scene really fits, eh?

5409
02:22:30,630 --> 02:22:33,900
Oh wow, cool!

5410
02:22:31,390 --> 02:22:33,880
Wow!

5411
02:22:33,920 --> 02:22:39,440
The stunning and extravagant Top Star

5412
02:22:36,520 --> 02:22:38,350
He's not even looking down at his feet

5413
02:22:38,340 --> 02:22:39,440
He didn't even watch his step

5414
02:22:39,440 --> 02:22:41,720
He kept looking straight!

5415
02:22:40,070 --> 02:22:43,310
Seriously, without looking down once!

5416
02:22:41,710 --> 02:22:43,310
Look!

5417
02:22:44,210 --> 02:22:47,210
Saying that does make me kinda happy

5418
02:22:47,210 --> 02:22:48,780
Cool!

5419
02:22:49,520 --> 02:22:52,720
Twenty minutes since the exercise started

5420
02:22:52,720 --> 02:22:55,790
The amount of Oni has been increased

5421
02:22:53,090 --> 02:22:55,790
Once more the number of Oni increases further

5422
02:22:59,430 --> 02:23:36,600
Monster

5423
02:23:02,880 --> 02:23:04,680
Ah, the monster

5424
02:23:03,250 --> 02:23:05,500
You're blocking!

5425
02:23:06,430 --> 02:23:08,080
He was definitely blocking

5426
02:23:08,070 --> 02:23:10,400
Yep, the Top Star

5427
02:23:08,500 --> 02:23:09,240
What? Me?

5428
02:23:09,240 --> 02:23:10,400
What? Me?

5429
02:23:10,400 --> 02:23:12,270
The monster?

5430
02:23:10,790 --> 02:23:12,400
Here's the monster

5431
02:23:12,370 --> 02:23:16,980
The photogenic and handsome Top Star

5432
02:23:12,760 --> 02:23:14,610
What's that?

5433
02:23:14,620 --> 02:23:16,980
I'm safe!

5434
02:23:17,610 --> 02:23:19,410
There's more coming

5435
02:23:18,010 --> 02:23:19,410
Eh?!

5436
02:23:19,730 --> 02:23:21,050
No way no way!

5437
02:23:20,080 --> 02:23:21,050
They keep coming

5438
02:23:21,050 --> 02:23:21,750
There's so many!

5439
02:23:21,750 --> 02:23:22,080
No

5440
02:23:22,080 --> 02:23:22,480
No

5441
02:23:22,480 --> 02:23:23,180
No

5442
02:23:23,180 --> 02:23:25,150
A bunch more of the Monsters came

5443
02:23:23,880 --> 02:23:25,150
What's all this?!

5444
02:23:25,150 --> 02:23:26,120
It's a whole herd!

5445
02:23:26,120 --> 02:23:28,050
The hell? I hate this!

5446
02:23:28,050 --> 02:23:29,520
The hell? I hate this!

5447
02:23:28,160 --> 02:23:29,520
Oh man that's scary

5448
02:23:29,520 --> 02:23:33,030
Ouch

5449
02:23:30,710 --> 02:23:32,310
It hurts?

5450
02:23:33,030 --> 02:23:35,510
What are they doing?

5451
02:23:34,390 --> 02:23:36,600
This is scary

5452
02:23:35,510 --> 02:23:36,600
What does "monster" mean here?

5453
02:23:36,600 --> 02:23:38,140
Monster-san

5454
02:23:39,000 --> 02:23:40,460
You're done?

5455
02:23:43,200 --> 02:23:45,450
Waaaaah!

5456
02:23:45,870 --> 02:23:45,890
The monster!

5457
02:23:45,890 --> 02:23:45,900
The monster!

5458
02:23:45,900 --> 02:23:45,920
The monster!

5459
02:23:45,920 --> 02:23:45,940
The monster!

5460
02:23:45,940 --> 02:23:45,960
The monster!

5461
02:23:45,960 --> 02:23:45,970
The monster!

5462
02:23:45,970 --> 02:23:45,990
The monster!

5463
02:23:45,990 --> 02:23:46,010
The monster!

5464
02:23:46,010 --> 02:23:46,020
The monster!

5465
02:23:46,020 --> 02:23:46,040
The monster!

5466
02:23:46,040 --> 02:23:46,060
The monster!

5467
02:23:46,060 --> 02:23:46,070
The monster!

5468
02:23:46,070 --> 02:23:46,090
The monster!

5469
02:23:46,090 --> 02:23:46,110
The monster!

5470
02:23:46,110 --> 02:23:46,120
The monster!

5471
02:23:46,120 --> 02:23:46,140
The monster!

5472
02:23:46,140 --> 02:23:46,160
The monster!

5473
02:23:46,160 --> 02:23:46,170
The monster!

5474
02:23:46,170 --> 02:23:46,190

5636
02:24:12,560 --> 02:24:13,670
That's just a monster!

5637
02:24:13,670 --> 02:24:15,770
No way that's Hama-chan!

5638
02:24:14,570 --> 02:24:15,770
That's a monster!

5639
02:24:15,820 --> 02:24:17,820
"You lie!"

5640
02:24:16,040 --> 02:24:19,110
This is the worst...

5641
02:24:19,710 --> 02:24:21,940
Oi!!

5642
02:24:20,060 --> 02:24:21,940
Not again...

5643
02:24:21,940 --> 02:24:23,740
Don't let the monster near me! Protect the Top Star!

5644
02:24:23,740 --> 02:24:25,780
Don't let the monster near me! Protect the Top Star!

5645
02:24:24,160 --> 02:24:25,780
I understand

5646
02:24:24,650 --> 02:24:25,780
Excuse us

5647
02:24:25,790 --> 02:24:31,750
The Star that hates all monsters

5648
02:24:26,340 --> 02:24:27,900
That's right

5649
02:24:29,670 --> 02:24:31,750
There's monsters and Top Stars all around

5650
02:24:30,900 --> 02:24:32,700
He's really enjoying it

5651
02:24:31,750 --> 02:24:35,390
He said "Don't let the monster near the Top Star"

5652
02:24:35,390 --> 02:24:36,860
So you mind just leaving this place?

5653
02:24:35,690 --> 02:24:36,860
Yes, it's just...

5654
02:24:37,260 --> 02:24:38,790
I know he said that, but I'm the one suffering here

5655
02:24:38,790 --> 02:24:40,960
I thought we were partners

5656
02:24:40,960 --> 02:24:44,060
He even said "Don't let the monster near"

5657
02:24:44,060 --> 02:24:45,500
Hasn't he forgotten the plan here?

5658
02:24:45,630 --> 02:24:47,100
He's desperately defending the setting

5659
02:24:47,100 --> 02:24:49,540
Well yeah, but even the Top Star idea is weird

5660
02:24:50,000 --> 02:24:52,170
The setting here, they're really going all out

5661
02:24:52,170 --> 02:24:54,240
The setting here, they're really going all out

5662
02:24:54,610 --> 02:24:56,540
So I told the monster, but

5663
02:24:56,540 --> 02:24:58,810
Why the hell, man, we're partners!

5664
02:24:57,210 --> 02:24:58,810
What's with this attitude

5665
02:24:58,810 --> 02:24:58,830
QUIET, FOUL BEAST

5666
02:24:58,840 --> 02:24:58,850
QUIET, FOUL BEAST

5667
02:24:58,850 --> 02:24:58,860
QUIET, FOUL BEAST

5668
02:24:58,870 --> 02:24:58,890

5676
02:25:01,180 --> 02:25:02,750
YOU MONSTER!!

5677
02:25:04,120 --> 02:25:05,390
That guy is really pissing me off

5678
02:25:05,390 --> 02:25:08,120
It'd be great if he gets caught and then completely beaten up

5679
02:25:08,720 --> 02:25:12,160
Did it start with "pa"?

5680
02:25:11,210 --> 02:25:12,980
Still not there yet?

5681
02:25:12,160 --> 02:25:14,290
AH!! I remember!

5682
02:25:14,290 --> 02:25:16,900
AH!! I remember!

5683
02:25:14,930 --> 02:25:16,470
There it is

5684
02:25:15,860 --> 02:25:17,860
Out of the blue, eh?

5685
02:25:16,810 --> 02:25:20,470

02:25:21,130 --> 02:25:23,040
Ah

5693
02:25:23,040 --> 02:25:24,240
Awesome!

5694
02:25:24,940 --> 02:25:26,230
It's Leo-sama!

5695
02:25:26,060 --> 02:25:28,220
Yon-sama

5696
02:25:26,060 --> 02:25:30,770
Leo-sama finally came to Matsumoto

5697
02:25:27,450 --> 02:25:30,140
Ah I got it!

5698
02:25:30,140 --> 02:25:31,050

Ah, found it!

Ah!

5714
02:25:36,670 --> 02:25:37,780
There it is!

5715
02:25:38,180 --> 02:25:41,010
They've found a treasure chest at last

5716
02:25:38,520 --> 02:25:39,810
Come on!

5717
02:25:39,810 --> 02:25:41,020
Let's go!

5718
02:25:43,760 --> 02:25:46,660
Get the code to
open this box by
asking
Matsumoto

5719
02:25:43,760 --> 02:25:46,660
You can get the code by asking Matsumoto!

5722
02:25:48,390 --> 02:25:49,360
We can phone him up?

5723
02:25:49,360 --> 02:25:50,830
Ah, it's like that

5724
02:25:49,700 --> 02:25:53,170
We can probably ask him via this phone

5725
02:25:50,830 --> 02:25:52,830
Ah I see

5726
02:25:53,570 --> 02:25:55,130
To-ki...

5727
02:25:56,190 --> 02:25:57,690
Oh Jesus that scared me

5728
02:26:00,810 --> 02:26:01,600
Yes?

5729
02:26:01,580 --> 02:26:03,610
Matsumoto-san? Is there a code there you can give us?

5730
02:26:02,780 --> 02:26:03,610
Yes

5731
02:26:03,610 --> 02:26:06,410
Matsumoto-san? Is there a code there you can give us?

02:26:23,160 --> 02:26:23,930
"Stop time"!! I think!

5748
02:26:25,430 --> 02:26:26,570
It opened!

5749
02:26:26,570 --> 02:26:28,570
We got it, we got it!

5750
02:26:26,580 --> 02:26:29,600
They got the right answer by coincidence

5751
02:26:27,070 --> 02:26:28,570
Thank God!

5752
02:26:30,460 --> 02:26:31,880
However!

5753
02:26:31,650 --> 02:26:38,540
There was no key, the box was empty

5754
02:26:31,880 --> 02:26:34,510
Their efforts were in vain

5755
02:26:34,510 --> 02:26:38,210
The treasure chest was empty - a swing and miss

5756
02:26:38,740 --> 02:26:42,750
Three of them head towards the training grounds

5757
02:26:39,550 --> 02:26:42,130
Moving forward, three headed to the field

5758
02:26:42,850 --> 02:26:47,340
Two of them went to search the first floor

5759
02:26:43,300 --> 02:26:46,440
Tanaka and Inoue search the inside of the building

5760
02:26:46,440 --> 02:26:47,660
The broadcasting room

5761
02:26:47,890 --> 02:26:50,120
Oh, there's a box!

5762
02:26:48,440 --> 02:26:49,640
Ah, there it is!

5763
02:26:50,120 --> 02:26:51,260
There was a box right there!

5764
02:26:51,420 --> 02:26:53,140
This one doesn't need a key neither, so...

5765
02:26:53,140 --> 02:26:54,290
Open it up, can you do that?

5766
02:26:56,000 --> 02:26:57,960
What is this...

5767
02:26:56,960 --> 02:26:57,960
Hm?

5768
02:26:59,450 --> 02:27:00,650
Wait, what's this?

5769
02:27:00,650 --> 02:27:01,400
Huh?

5770
02:27:01,400 --> 02:27:02,900
There's a letter

5771
02:27:03,020 --> 02:27:14,650
Substitute Doll

If an Oni catches you,
give them this doll, and
say a member's name.
That member will then
take your place instead

5774
02:27:12,460 --> 02:27:13,560
We hit the jackpot!

5775
02:27:13,560 --> 02:27:14,710
This is great

5776
02:27:14,680 --> 02:27:20,790
The two are happy to receive tools from the devil

5777
02:27:15,350 --> 02:27:17,170
This is great!

5778
02:27:19,820 --> 02:27:21,150
This is great!!

5779
02:27:21,150 --> 02:27:23,320
Moreover, there's two!!

5780
02:27:23,320 --> 02:27:24,120
There are! Shall we go?

5781
02:27:24,120 --> 02:27:25,030
There are! Shall we go?

5782
02:27:25,030 --> 02:27:26,660
Before that, I just got a bit of an idea...

5783
02:27:26,660 --> 02:27:28,730
There's a certain person I'd like to mention here

5784
02:27:28,330 --> 02:27:29,060
Hm...

5785
02:27:29,060 --> 02:27:29,630
It's Hamada-san

5786
02:27:29,630 --> 02:27:31,600
Ah, that's the one I thought, too

5787
02:27:31,600 --> 02:27:33,700
Without hesitation they go straight for Hamada

5788
02:27:31,650 --> 02:27:33,700
I was thinking Hamada-san

5789
02:27:32,280 --> 02:27:33,700
Can we both say Hamada-san here?

5790
02:27:33,700 --> 02:27:36,000
Right, we need to hide these

5791
02:27:34,320 --> 02:27:36,000
Should put them away

5792
02:27:36,000 --> 02:27:36,900
Keep this a secret

5793
02:27:36,900 --> 02:27:38,640
This must be a secret

5794
02:27:37,250 --> 02:27:39,240
I had no idea about this

5795
02:27:38,350 --> 02:27:39,240
Right?

5796
02:27:39,140 --> 02:27:41,370
Matsumoto-san?

5797
02:27:40,240 --> 02:27:41,380
Hah?

5798
02:27:41,370 --> 02:27:42,940
You're leaving lots of feathers behind

5799
02:27:44,490 --> 02:27:46,610
I, uh-

5800
02:27:45,580 --> 02:27:46,610
Do they come off that easily?

5801
02:27:46,610 --> 02:27:49,080
The Top Star is still as cool as usual!

5802
02:27:49,080 --> 02:27:51,990
Nothing in the exercise area!

5803
02:27:50,670 --> 02:27:51,990
Nothing?

5804
02:27:51,990 --> 02:27:53,500
What about the first floor?

5805
02:27:53,500 --> 02:27:54,940
Nothing on our end

5806
02:27:54,040 --> 02:27:54,940
Nothing

5807
02:27:54,940 --> 02:27:55,980
The hell...

5808
02:27:55,620 --> 02:27:56,660
There was nothing!

5809
02:27:56,660 --> 02:27:59,460
Definitely nothing on the first floor!

5810
02:27:59,460 --> 02:28:01,460
These guys are evil

5811
02:28:00,540 --> 02:28:31,220
Megaphone

5812
02:28:05,830 --> 02:28:06,770
Yep, he's locked on!

5813
02:28:06,830 --> 02:28:07,070
Hamada

5814
02:28:07,070 --> 02:28:07,270
Hamada

5815
02:28:07,270 --> 02:28:07,500
Hamada

5816
02:28:07,500 --> 02:28:08,640
Hamada

5817
02:28:09,600 --> 02:28:10,600
Hamada

5818
02:28:10,600 --> 02:28:11,870
Please go for Hamada

5819
02:28:12,100 --> 02:28:13,380
Go for Hamada

5820
02:28:14,020 --> 02:28:16,020
So that's why??

5821
02:28:15,010 --> 02:28:16,340
Huh? Wait what?

5822
02:28:18,290 --> 02:28:21,750
I see, I thought that was a bit weird

5823
02:28:19,880 --> 02:28:20,710
Wait a second

5824
02:28:20,710 --> 02:28:21,280
Wait a second

5825
02:28:21,280 --> 02:28:21,820
Why?

5826
02:28:21,820 --> 02:28:22,950
Why?

5827
02:28:22,950 --> 02:28:23,750
Weren't you supposed to go for Tanaka?

5828
02:28:23,750 --> 02:28:24,950
Weren't you supposed to go for Tanaka?

5829
02:28:24,950 --> 02:28:27,550
Are you alright, Hamada-san?

5830
02:28:25,240 --> 02:28:26,360
This is supposed to be for Tanaka!!

5831
02:28:25,980 --> 02:28:27,660
That made no sense

5832
02:28:27,550 --> 02:28:28,990
You alright?

5833
02:28:29,860 --> 02:28:31,220
Ouch

5834
02:28:31,220 --> 02:28:32,760
That hurts, that hurts

5835
02:28:32,760 --> 02:28:33,860
That hurts, that hurts

5836
02:28:33,990 --> 02:28:35,850
This is weird

5837
02:28:34,490 --> 02:28:38,530
Seriously, what happened?

5838
02:28:35,850 --> 02:28:37,600
I thought I heard you a bit

5839
02:28:38,530 --> 02:28:40,130
Tanaka . . . Tanaka got locked on, right?

5840
02:28:40,130 --> 02:28:41,570
Tanaka . . . Tanaka got locked on, right?

5841
02:28:41,570 --> 02:28:42,700
How was it?

5842
02:28:42,700 --> 02:28:43,770
Don't "how was it" me, why didn't you get it

5843
02:28:43,770 --> 02:28:45,140
Don't "how was it" me, why didn't you get it

5844
02:28:45,140 --> 02:28:47,310
Don't know, I also thought I got caught

5845
02:28:47,310 --> 02:28:48,680
The Oni turned around, and ran the other way

5846
02:28:48,680 --> 02:28:51,010
The Oni turned around, and ran the other way

5847
02:28:49,090 --> 02:28:51,160
Huh? That's weird!

5848
02:28:51,010 --> 02:28:51,910
But still, you got caught!

5849
02:28:51,910 --> 02:28:54,810
But still, you got caught!

5850
02:28:54,850 --> 02:28:56,150
Hold up a second

5851
02:28:56,280 --> 02:28:57,720
I'm so sorry

5852
02:28:57,720 --> 02:28:59,150
The wind...

5853
02:28:58,670 --> 02:28:59,310
The wind?

5854
02:28:59,210 --> 02:29:04,860
The Star that got blown away by the wind

5855
02:29:00,940 --> 02:29:01,790
Really?

5856
02:29:02,620 --> 02:29:04,860
Be more careful, please

5857
02:29:05,590 --> 02:29:07,690
This is hell

5858
02:29:05,590 --> 02:29:07,690
This is the worst

5859
02:29:06,580 --> 02:29:08,730
This guy is dirty!

5860
02:29:07,990 --> 02:29:09,030
I'm sorry that it happened

5861
02:29:09,190 --> 02:29:43,500
Leathers

5862
02:29:09,490 --> 02:29:11,490
We didn't notice him at all

5863
02:29:13,200 --> 02:29:14,880
Wait, hold up

5864
02:29:14,280 --> 02:29:16,230
There we go

5865
02:29:15,400 --> 02:29:16,470
Wait a second

5866
02:29:16,470 --> 02:29:16,700
Hamada-san

5867
02:29:16,700 --> 02:29:16,970
Hamada-san

5868
02:29:16,970 --> 02:29:18,170
Hamada-san

5869
02:29:20,590 --> 02:29:21,670
They got him

5870
02:29:21,670 --> 02:29:22,590
They just caught him

5871
02:29:23,340 --> 02:29:25,110
Oi!! Why the hell!!

5872
02:29:25,110 --> 02:29:26,950
I said why the hell!

5873
02:29:27,580 --> 02:29:29,280
They just keep going after Hamada-san

5874
02:29:29,010 --> 02:29:31,130
I even said "OK"

5875
02:29:29,280 --> 02:29:31,280
Why?!

5876
02:29:31,370 --> 02:29:32,220
Hamada-san!

5877
02:29:32,220 --> 02:29:32,550
Wait!!

5878
02:29:32,220 --> 02:29:33,520
Wai-

5879
02:29:32,550 --> 02:29:32,790
Wait!!

5880
02:29:32,790 --> 02:29:33,050
Wait!!

5881
02:29:33,050 --> 02:29:33,520
Wait!!

5882
02:29:33,520 --> 02:29:35,590
Naoya! You got caught!

5883
02:29:33,890 --> 02:29:34,480
Hamada-san!

5884
02:29:34,470 --> 02:29:35,590
He stopped!

5885
02:29:34,790 --> 02:29:35,590
He stopped

5886
02:29:35,590 --> 02:29:36,610
Why me!

5887
02:29:37,390 --> 02:29:38,320
Yep, they caught Hamada-san

5888
02:29:38,470 --> 02:29:39,480
Naoya you...

5889
02:29:39,480 --> 02:29:40,980
You got caught!!

5890
02:29:40,340 --> 02:29:40,980
That pisses me off

5891
02:29:40,980 --> 02:29:42,000
Yeah, that does piss me off too

5892
02:29:43,800 --> 02:29:46,870
AHHHHH OUCH!!

5893
02:29:46,870 --> 02:29:48,030
That one was bad!

5894
02:29:48,030 --> 02:29:49,040
Great hit!

5895
02:29:49,040 --> 02:29:50,900
Great hit!

5896
02:29:49,740 --> 02:29:50,900
That one hit the spot

5897
02:29:50,900 --> 02:29:52,340
That one must have hurt

5898
02:29:52,340 --> 02:29:52,640
Wind

5899
02:29:52,640 --> 02:29:52,910
Wind

5900
02:29:52,910 --> 02:29:54,270
Wind

5901
02:29:54,460 --> 02:29:55,480
Hosei-san!

5902
02:29:55,240 --> 02:29:56,810
"Wind, wind wind!"

5903
02:29:55,370 --> 02:29:56,680
Oh what is even going on

5904
02:29:56,680 --> 02:29:59,710
Hosei, this is my bit!

5905
02:29:59,730 --> 02:30:07,550
The Star calmly stole away the leading role

5906
02:30:01,730 --> 02:30:03,460
We have an emergency

5907
02:30:02,650 --> 02:30:05,020
We need some help here

5908
02:30:05,000 --> 02:30:06,360
Yama-chan...

5909
02:30:05,020 --> 02:30:07,250
Let's bring him closer to Hamada-san

5910
02:30:06,350 --> 02:30:07,550
Bring him here!

5911
02:30:09,430 --> 02:30:11,130
This is some crazy wind! The hell?!

5912
02:30:11,050 --> 02:30:12,140
It is!

5913
02:30:11,130 --> 02:30:12,970
This is some crazy wind! The hell?!

5914
02:30:11,880 --> 02:30:13,000
It really is amazing

5915
02:30:12,780 --> 02:30:14,720
I'm the one that got hit!

5916
02:30:14,620 --> 02:30:15,730
The wind...

5917
02:30:15,070 --> 02:30:16,970
Oh, did you get hit because of the feather?

5918
02:30:16,810 --> 02:30:18,930
No I don't think so...

5919
02:30:18,500 --> 02:30:21,330
No cause, holding one and wearing them is different!

5920
02:30:21,720 --> 02:30:25,440
The Top Star, completely off mark

5921
02:30:21,800 --> 02:30:22,600
Tanaka...

5922
02:30:23,400 --> 02:30:24,300
Hm?

5923
02:30:23,860 --> 02:30:25,000
Take... It?

5924
02:30:25,880 --> 02:30:26,810
Just to make sure, let's find an oni

5925
02:30:26,020 --> 02:30:27,480
It'll be because of this, right

5926
02:30:26,810 --> 02:30:28,780
Just to make sure, let's find an oni

5927
02:30:27,430 --> 02:30:30,160
The leather one was bad

5928
02:30:28,840 --> 02:30:30,330
I'll be carrying the feather

5929
02:30:29,810 --> 02:30:30,860
It was rough!

5930
02:30:29,880 --> 02:30:31,920
Yeah that seemed real painful

5931
02:30:31,440 --> 02:30:32,720
The leather jacket

5932
02:30:32,950 --> 02:30:34,020
Hey Champ, that went well

5933
02:30:34,020 --> 02:30:35,420
We got him, eh?

5934
02:30:35,420 --> 02:30:37,290
You nailed the way you used it too

5935
02:30:37,290 --> 02:30:38,360
There's no way you could take that punishment

5936
02:30:38,360 --> 02:30:40,790
There's no way you could take that punishment

5937
02:30:40,790 --> 02:30:42,630
It would affect your professional career as well

5938
02:30:42,630 --> 02:30:44,730
What indeed could you be talking about?

5939
02:30:44,730 --> 02:30:46,570
I'll be holding on to this

5940
02:30:46,570 --> 02:30:48,170
I'll take responsibility here

5941
02:30:48,060 --> 02:30:49,210
What the hell?

5942
02:30:48,170 --> 02:30:51,000
Let's try it out

5943
02:30:52,060 --> 02:30:53,190
What was all that

5944
02:30:53,140 --> 02:30:56,110
Just as we suspected

5945
02:30:56,110 --> 02:30:57,610
Wait, is this really it?

5946
02:30:57,630 --> 02:31:02,480
Their mistaken idea becomes reality

5947
02:30:57,670 --> 02:30:59,320
Do the feathers really matter?

5948
02:30:59,320 --> 02:31:00,670
They really came to me because of this?

5949
02:31:00,780 --> 02:31:02,080
They really came to me because of this?

5950
02:31:02,480 --> 02:31:05,950
Shower of Leaves

5951
02:31:02,480 --> 02:31:05,950
Turns out it's just as Hosei said

5952
02:31:03,370 --> 02:31:04,760
What does "Shower of Leaves" mean?

5953
02:31:06,220 --> 02:31:07,350
Huh?

5954
02:31:07,350 --> 02:31:08,820
Kinoshita is doing something

5955
02:31:08,820 --> 02:31:09,990
Kinoshita is doing something

5956
02:31:10,070 --> 02:31:16,430
TKO Kinoshita

5957
02:31:13,240 --> 02:31:16,430
The two, engrossed in a mobile game

5958
02:31:14,860 --> 02:31:16,530
Seems like a bunch of stuff is gonna happen

5959
02:31:16,430 --> 02:32:02,780
Shower of Leaves

5960
02:31:16,660 --> 02:31:19,100
Is this fine?

5961
02:31:17,880 --> 02:31:19,350
This seems scary

5962
02:31:19,360 --> 02:31:20,450
This is scary!

5963
02:31:19,920 --> 02:31:20,940
What's going on

5964
02:31:21,370 --> 02:31:22,970
Champion, take a look

5965
02:31:22,970 --> 02:31:25,200
Something amazing is waiting over there

5966
02:31:25,200 --> 02:31:25,910
That thing?

5967
02:31:26,550 --> 02:31:28,290
What is this, it's a bit scary

5968
02:31:28,240 --> 02:31:31,680
How are your stomach muscles?

5969
02:31:28,960 --> 02:31:30,500
Huh? They're not strong I guess

5970
02:31:30,190 --> 02:31:31,830
I don't think those are going to help you

5971
02:31:31,680 --> 02:31:34,610
That an 11 ton truck?

5972
02:31:33,560 --> 02:31:34,770
Hold up, what?

5973
02:31:34,730 --> 02:31:38,080
A huge amount of leaves

5974
02:31:35,330 --> 02:31:36,450
Oh that is scary

5975
02:31:35,830 --> 02:31:38,120
Wait, this is bad!

5976
02:31:38,180 --> 02:31:41,090
Ah, hold up, this is bad!

5977
02:31:38,680 --> 02:31:40,050
This is no good!

5978
02:31:40,310 --> 02:31:41,500
You serious?

5979
02:31:41,590 --> 02:31:44,420
Close your eyes!

5980
02:31:41,810 --> 02:31:42,670
This is dangerous!

5981
02:31:44,420 --> 02:31:45,260
Seriously?

5982
02:31:45,690 --> 02:31:49,090
Scary

5983
02:31:47,000 --> 02:31:48,700
It's getting damn close!

5984
02:31:49,500 --> 02:31:51,800
Scary

5985
02:31:49,660 --> 02:31:51,800
Scary

5986
02:31:49,830 --> 02:31:51,800
Scary

5987
02:31:50,030 --> 02:31:51,800
Scary

5988
02:31:52,480 --> 02:31:54,270
That really is close!

5989
02:32:04,770 --> 02:32:06,870
Treasure Hunters will continue!

5990
02:32:07,360 --> 02:32:09,380
More big named celebrities, one after the other!

5991
02:32:11,340 --> 02:32:14,090
This year as well, Hosei will...

5992
02:32:18,580 --> 02:32:20,100
I wouldn't want this

5993
02:32:18,760 --> 02:32:20,520
That really is close!

5994
02:32:30,700 --> 02:32:32,280
Holy hell, how scary!

5995
02:32:34,270 --> 02:32:42,110
Shower of Leaves

5996
02:32:41,070 --> 02:32:42,370
You're all laughing hard!

5997
02:32:42,890 --> 02:32:44,020
Look at Top Star

5998
02:32:47,750 --> 02:32:49,020
Tanaka disappeared somewhere!

5999
02:32:49,040 --> 02:32:53,160
Tanaka disappeared

6000
02:32:49,290 --> 02:32:50,810
Tanaka! Where did you go?!

6001
02:32:53,250 --> 02:32:54,670
Oh man...

6002
02:32:54,030 --> 02:32:55,530
Tanaka's coming out!!

6003
02:32:55,750 --> 02:32:57,510
A bit more!

6004
02:32:57,560 --> 02:32:59,130
It's a zombie!

6005
02:32:58,250 --> 02:32:59,130
Definitely a zombie!

6006
02:32:59,130 --> 02:33:01,830
Pull him out

6007
02:33:02,100 --> 02:33:05,770
He's buried in there deep

6008
02:33:05,770 --> 02:33:07,670
Tanaka-san!

6009
02:33:11,110 --> 02:33:13,410
So uh, Tanaka-san is crying

6010
02:33:13,410 --> 02:33:15,080
That was incredible

6011
02:33:15,080 --> 02:33:19,790
That was so damn heavy

6012
02:33:16,950 --> 02:33:17,900
It would be heavy

6013
02:33:17,640 --> 02:33:19,010
Really heavy

6014
02:33:18,620 --> 02:33:19,660
Haha, wait...

6015
02:33:19,640 --> 02:33:21,200
I couldn't move at all

6016
02:33:21,200 --> 02:33:22,770
You were under some serious pressure

6017
02:33:21,960 --> 02:33:23,540
Right

6018
02:33:23,650 --> 02:33:28,590
Stocking Portrait

6019
02:33:24,720 --> 02:33:25,760
What's written there?

6020
02:33:25,230 --> 02:33:28,550
After this, the search for the key continues

6021
02:33:28,710 --> 02:33:43,940
Flying Pie

6022
02:33:29,810 --> 02:33:32,740
One after another they fall victim to the Oni

6023
02:33:37,700 --> 02:33:38,840
And so, there you have the Flying Pie

6024
02:33:38,840 --> 02:33:43,940
And so, there you have the Flying Pie

6025
02:33:44,460 --> 02:33:46,080
Since the start,

6026
02:33:46,080 --> 02:33:50,450
40 minutes have passed, the amount of Oni will increase

6027
02:33:48,250 --> 02:33:50,950
Once again, the number of Oni increases

6028
02:33:51,130 --> 02:33:55,020
They return to search the building again

6029
02:33:57,060 --> 02:33:57,840
Nothing here

6030
02:34:02,750 --> 02:34:03,870
Go, go!

6031
02:34:05,430 --> 02:34:07,030
Why's it me? Hosei's right here

6032
02:34:06,700 --> 02:36:08,290
Hand Power

6033
02:34:07,030 --> 02:34:09,830
Why's it me? Hosei's right here

6034
02:34:09,700 --> 02:34:10,840
Thank God he took Hamada-san

6035
02:34:10,940 --> 02:34:12,100
Ah, they caught Hamada-san

6036
02:34:11,640 --> 02:34:12,800
Got him

6037
02:34:12,430 --> 02:34:13,450
Hamada-san...

6038
02:34:12,870 --> 02:34:14,610
HOSEI WAS RIGHT THERE!

6039
02:34:14,630 --> 02:34:16,180
I'm safe

6040
02:34:15,620 --> 02:34:16,450
Hand Power?

6041
02:34:15,920 --> 02:34:18,170
I wonder what that is

6042
02:34:18,530 --> 02:34:19,860
It's Hand Power

6043
02:34:20,060 --> 02:34:20,890
What could it be?

6044
02:34:21,310 --> 02:34:22,490
Hand Power

6045
02:34:23,270 --> 02:34:25,930
Hamada was taken to another place

6046
02:34:26,260 --> 02:34:29,050
Something in here, that can't be good

6047
02:34:26,640 --> 02:34:27,580
Woah, this place is huge

6048
02:34:29,270 --> 02:34:31,400
The gym ones are always the worst

6049
02:34:31,570 --> 02:34:36,300
Standing by on top of the stage

6050
02:34:32,390 --> 02:34:35,770
He's standing by on the stage all alone

6051
02:34:36,300 --> 02:34:39,870
So what's gonna happen now?

6052
02:34:37,890 --> 02:34:39,800
Right? Haven't figured anything out yet

6053
02:34:42,170 --> 02:34:42,940
Hand Power has arrived

6054
02:34:42,940 --> 02:34:45,000
Hand Power has arrived

6055
02:34:42,940 --> 02:34:45,000
T/N: This Hand Power guy is Akira Matsuo, more famously known as Mr. Maric, the magician.

6056
02:34:45,000 --> 02:34:46,040
He's the real deal

6057
02:34:46,040 --> 02:34:46,970
Hamada-san, I will have you experience Hand Power yourself

6058
02:34:46,970 --> 02:34:48,870
Hamada-san, I will have you experience Hand Power yourself

6059
02:34:49,780 --> 02:34:51,110
Have you seen this before?

6060
02:34:53,080 --> 02:34:53,640
Yeah

6061
02:34:53,760 --> 02:34:54,670
You have, right?

6062
02:34:54,530 --> 02:34:58,920
Guillotine magic

6063
02:34:55,160 --> 02:34:56,090
Indeed

6064
02:34:59,120 --> 02:35:01,220
Please take a look at the way this cuts,

6065
02:35:01,220 --> 02:35:02,990
It's not completely normal

6066
02:35:05,420 --> 02:35:06,490
This is bad

6067
02:35:06,560 --> 02:35:08,660
Everything's an experience

6068
02:35:08,040 --> 02:35:09,540
Experience? Is here alright?

6069
02:35:09,620 --> 02:35:10,490
That's perfect

6070
02:35:10,370 --> 02:35:11,910
Please, I'm counting on you

6071
02:35:11,690 --> 02:35:12,250
Here we go

6072
02:35:11,850 --> 02:35:12,960
Actually I wonder if that's alright

6073
02:35:12,820 --> 02:35:14,120
Huh?! Wait, stop

6074
02:35:14,150 --> 02:35:15,360
It's dangerous, so-

6075
02:35:19,000 --> 02:35:21,210
You're alright

6076
02:35:21,210 --> 02:35:22,610
Actually, today, we've got one more person here

6077
02:35:22,610 --> 02:35:24,510
Actually, today, we've got one more person here

6078
02:35:24,680 --> 02:35:25,850
Oi, come on out

6079
02:35:28,130 --> 02:35:32,420
T/N: Luna is Mr. Maric's actual daughter. She is a famous Japanese rapper and R&B artist.

6080
02:35:28,130 --> 02:35:32,420
The beloved daughter, Luna

6081
02:35:31,720 --> 02:35:33,270
No way, no no no

6082
02:35:35,290 --> 02:35:37,590
Hamada-san, please take your seat

6083
02:35:36,740 --> 02:35:37,560
Oh, I can?

6084
02:35:37,590 --> 02:35:40,030
Actually, the thing I wanted to show everyone today

6085
02:35:40,030 --> 02:35:41,090
will now commence

6086
02:35:41,790 --> 02:35:43,660
A never before seen, amazing Hand Power

6087
02:35:43,660 --> 02:35:45,360
will debut here in front of your eyes

6088
02:35:44,360 --> 02:35:45,110
Really?

6089
02:35:45,360 --> 02:35:47,000
Luna will, in just an instant, teleport away

6090
02:35:47,000 --> 02:35:49,370
Luna will, in just an instant, teleport away

6091
02:35:49,870 --> 02:35:52,740
And reappear in a truly unimaginable place

6092
02:35:52,750 --> 02:35:56,640
Luna will teleport

6093
02:35:53,300 --> 02:35:54,720
If he did that...

6094
02:35:54,170 --> 02:35:56,390
If you do that, that will really be amazing

6095
02:35:56,100 --> 02:35:57,230
I wanna see this

6096
02:35:59,580 --> 02:36:01,580
And now, she will disappear

6097
02:36:01,250 --> 02:36:02,190
No way

6098
02:36:02,780 --> 02:36:03,650
Hand Power!

6099
02:36:03,650 --> 02:36:04,980
Hand Power!

6100
02:36:10,420 --> 02:36:11,780
There you are!

6101
02:36:11,790 --> 02:36:13,790
LET'S GO

6102
02:36:13,490 --> 02:36:43,650
Egashira

6103
02:36:14,560 --> 02:36:15,560
This is a joke!!

6104
02:36:17,420 --> 02:36:19,590
She really did disappear
and then he appeared

6105
02:36:19,840 --> 02:36:20,900
It's magic

6106
02:36:23,000 --> 02:36:25,540
I'VE ARRIVED

6107
02:36:25,540 --> 02:36:27,060
THE ANNUAL EGA-CHAN FESTIVAL!!

6108
02:36:27,060 --> 02:36:29,270
THE ANNUAL EGA-CHAN FESTIVAL!!

6109
02:36:31,410 --> 02:36:33,660
It's always an Ega-chan Festival

6110
02:36:31,560 --> 02:36:36,080
Ega-chan festival's opening performance

6111
02:36:34,850 --> 02:36:37,240
LET'S GO!

6112
02:36:40,210 --> 02:36:41,360
What's he doing?

6113
02:36:40,900 --> 02:36:43,660
Guzzling down an unknown fluid

6114
02:36:41,100 --> 02:36:41,950
What is that?

6115
02:36:41,950 --> 02:36:42,630
Scary

6116
02:36:43,890 --> 02:36:45,700
Tanaka looks dead already

6117
02:36:54,970 --> 02:36:56,690
It's all over you

6118
02:36:57,000 --> 02:37:00,010
I DID IT AGAIN!!

6119
02:37:04,170 --> 02:37:05,610
Why does he have to spit on us?!

6120
02:37:06,040 --> 02:37:08,350
Time for my part time job!

6121
02:37:06,590 --> 02:37:08,330
I didn't even realize he spat on you guys!

6122
02:37:08,070 --> 02:37:09,120
He's just evil

6123
02:37:09,690 --> 02:37:11,700
He just plainly came and spat at us

6124
02:37:10,680 --> 02:37:12,380
He sprayed you down like it was normal

6125
02:37:11,860 --> 02:37:13,450
He spat on you guys!

6126
02:37:14,150 --> 02:37:15,350
What the hell was that about?

6127
02:37:15,980 --> 02:37:17,620
Since the start of the training,

6128
02:37:17,620 --> 02:37:22,090
50 minutes have passed, the number of Oni will increase

6129
02:37:19,540 --> 02:37:22,260
Once again, more Oni are introduced

6130
02:37:22,260 --> 02:37:24,600
We need to find the key quickly

6131
02:37:28,410 --> 02:37:30,800
I don't want it, no no

6132
02:37:33,420 --> 02:37:34,530
Champion!

6133
02:37:34,140 --> 02:37:37,580
He got the Champion

6134
02:37:35,770 --> 02:37:36,790
The Champion got caught

6135
02:37:37,970 --> 02:37:40,140
You're going to need to take it for the team

6136
02:37:39,310 --> 02:37:40,980
They caught the Champion

6137
02:37:40,980 --> 02:37:43,320
Big Bang?

6138
02:37:40,980 --> 02:38:45,810
Big Bang

6139
02:37:43,320 --> 02:37:44,320
That's a big explosion, "big bang"

6140
02:37:44,320 --> 02:37:46,520
That's a big explosion, "big bang"

6141
02:37:44,440 --> 02:37:45,620
The hell is this?

6142
02:37:45,280 --> 02:37:46,720
This is seriously-

6143
02:37:47,920 --> 02:37:50,860
Hold up, this is really scary!

6144
02:37:49,140 --> 02:37:50,580
This would be scary

6145
02:37:50,860 --> 02:37:51,620
Huh? Now hold on a second, please

6146
02:37:51,050 --> 02:37:52,050
It's arrived

6147
02:37:51,620 --> 02:37:53,230
Huh? Now hold on a second, please

6148
02:37:53,230 --> 02:37:55,790
Something is coming

6149
02:37:54,270 --> 02:37:55,030
Champion!

6150
02:37:55,790 --> 02:37:58,700
They're using THAT?

6151
02:37:56,860 --> 02:37:59,040
I guess that's why it's here

6152
02:37:58,860 --> 02:38:01,400
They're using it?

6153
02:38:00,020 --> 02:38:01,660
Using that seems a bit...

6154
02:38:01,740 --> 02:38:03,000
Wait, wait, what are...

6155
02:38:02,490 --> 02:38:03,890
What's gonna happen?

6156
02:38:05,340 --> 02:38:06,980
Seriously, what's gonna happen?

6157
02:38:07,610 --> 02:38:09,540
Woah, there it is

6158
02:38:16,350 --> 02:38:19,050
So they're going to use it to break that?

6159
02:38:17,910 --> 02:38:19,240
That's how it is

6160
02:38:18,720 --> 02:38:20,320
What do you mean?

6161
02:38:21,240 --> 02:38:24,460
Using a massive digger to blow up the balloon

6162
02:38:21,490 --> 02:38:22,660
Man this is scary!

6163
02:38:23,120 --> 02:38:24,440
Be careful!

6164
02:38:24,460 --> 02:38:28,090
It's damn huge!

6165
02:38:26,140 --> 02:38:27,200
It's amazing

6166
02:38:26,660 --> 02:38:27,800
It keeps getting bigger

6167
02:38:29,790 --> 02:38:30,690
Ah, he's starting!

6168
02:38:30,690 --> 02:38:31,690
Agh, scary!

6169
02:38:48,250 --> 02:38:50,080
That really was a Big Bang!

6170
02:38:50,290 --> 02:38:52,880
I thought it would cut it open, but they pushed it down!

6171
02:38:52,540 --> 02:38:53,600
Right!

6172
02:38:52,680 --> 02:38:55,350
That was intense

6173
02:38:53,810 --> 02:38:55,500
They crushed it down

6174
02:38:55,570 --> 02:38:57,290
Even though I ran away, that was something

6175
02:38:56,760 --> 02:38:58,290
That was damn scary though

6176
02:38:58,480 --> 02:38:59,570
He took it straight

6177
02:38:59,190 --> 02:39:02,260
Ah, hold up a second

6178
02:39:02,280 --> 02:39:05,300
The key - found

6179
02:39:05,300 --> 02:39:08,800
It came out of the balloon, I think!

6180
02:39:06,070 --> 02:39:07,480
The balloon?

6181
02:39:07,090 --> 02:39:09,020
I think it was inside the balloon!

6182
02:39:07,260 --> 02:39:08,600
Is that how it is!

6183
02:39:09,070 --> 02:39:10,210
We got it, we got it!

6184
02:39:10,110 --> 02:39:12,080
Finally, they've found the key

6185
02:39:12,090 --> 02:39:19,140
Matsumoto is released

6186
02:39:13,060 --> 02:39:17,110
They overcome their hardships and release Matsumoto

6187
02:39:17,130 --> 02:39:19,250
That took so long!

6188
02:39:18,080 --> 02:39:19,360
That took a while!

6189
02:39:19,950 --> 02:39:21,380
Your training isn't over yet, so let's head back

6190
02:39:21,380 --> 02:39:22,100
Your training isn't over yet, so let's head back

6191
02:39:22,160 --> 02:39:26,720
Man, I've had enough

6192
02:39:24,240 --> 02:39:26,240
This is exhausting

6193
02:39:28,680 --> 02:39:30,040
4 PM

6194
02:39:29,250 --> 02:39:32,910
Research Lab - 8 hours into their duty

6195
02:39:30,040 --> 02:39:32,440
The five return to the research lab

6196
02:39:40,000 --> 02:39:42,720
Whoooa!!

6197
02:39:43,860 --> 02:39:44,560
And again

6198
02:39:45,270 --> 02:39:48,610
The drawers' contents

6199
02:39:45,270 --> 02:39:48,610
have all been reset

6200
02:39:45,290 --> 02:39:46,090
As usual

6201
02:39:46,620 --> 02:39:48,110
They did it again

6202
02:39:48,610 --> 02:39:51,840
They do this every time

6203
02:39:51,720 --> 02:39:53,020
Even though we're already this far

6204
02:39:53,080 --> 02:39:55,680
That thing is huge isn't it?

6205
02:40:01,490 --> 02:40:04,060
Someone definitely has something in number 3 waiting...

6206
02:40:03,400 --> 02:40:05,510
Seems that way

6207
02:40:04,200 --> 02:40:06,630
We haven't had anything in there yet

6208
02:40:04,750 --> 02:40:06,990
It's very different

6209
02:40:06,960 --> 02:40:08,540
The treasure chest

6210
02:40:06,960 --> 02:40:11,030
Number 3 is a locked treasure chest

6211
02:40:07,970 --> 02:40:09,340
It's a treasure chest

6212
02:40:08,640 --> 02:40:10,900
That really looks like a treasure chest

6213
02:40:10,600 --> 02:40:12,600
It's huge!

6214
02:40:12,600 --> 02:40:14,070
Hey, aren't those made in our likeness?

6215
02:40:14,070 --> 02:40:16,440
Hey, aren't those made in our likeness?

6216
02:40:16,440 --> 02:40:20,240
Dolls resembling the 5?

6217
02:40:17,760 --> 02:40:18,730
Is it?

6218
02:40:17,930 --> 02:40:18,730
Ahhh!

6219
02:40:18,770 --> 02:40:20,210
Is that what it is?

6220
02:40:20,810 --> 02:40:23,010
I don't know who's who

6221
02:40:22,210 --> 02:40:24,030
Tanaka must be the tall one, right?

6222
02:40:24,030 --> 02:40:25,140
On the left side

6223
02:40:25,810 --> 02:40:27,650
The next one is Hamada

6224
02:40:27,650 --> 02:40:29,050
Definitely

6225
02:40:29,050 --> 02:40:30,320
Hamada is the second from the right

6226
02:40:30,320 --> 02:40:32,080
Hamada is the second from the right

6227
02:40:32,100 --> 02:40:34,150
Teehee

6228
02:40:32,550 --> 02:40:34,150
The second from the right is Hamada

6229
02:40:37,100 --> 02:40:38,530
Why all of you?

6230
02:40:38,100 --> 02:40:41,730
You're saying stuff like "second from the right" like it's correct

6231
02:40:40,070 --> 02:40:41,310
That's weird

6232
02:40:44,060 --> 02:40:44,760
There's a reason there are five figures, for sure

6233
02:40:44,760 --> 02:40:47,570
There's a reason there are five figures, for sure

6234
02:40:46,650 --> 02:40:47,570
I see

6235
02:40:47,570 --> 02:40:51,300
Is Tanaka the one on the edge?

6236
02:40:49,430 --> 02:40:51,300
Tanaka is the first- that's Tanaka

6237
02:40:50,810 --> 02:40:53,270
So are these two Cocorico?

6238
02:40:51,300 --> 02:40:54,010
Endo

6239
02:40:51,300 --> 02:40:54,010
Tanaka

6240
02:40:52,940 --> 02:40:53,990
No, that's not it

6241
02:40:54,010 --> 02:40:56,540
Tanaka is first from the left, right?

6242
02:40:55,000 --> 02:40:56,540
The left one is me?

6243
02:40:56,540 --> 02:41:00,580
This is the spitting image of Hamada, isn't it?

6244
02:40:58,040 --> 02:40:58,740
This is Hamada, for sure. No, no, no

6245
02:40:58,740 --> 02:41:00,580
This is Hamada, for sure. No, no, no

6246
02:40:59,200 --> 02:41:00,580
Not even close!

6247
02:41:00,580 --> 02:41:01,430
This is-

6248
02:41:01,410 --> 02:41:07,150
Tanaka

6249
02:41:02,080 --> 02:41:07,150
Hamada

6250
02:41:03,180 --> 02:41:07,150
Natsumi

6251
02:41:03,180 --> 02:41:07,150
T/N: Natsumi is Hamada's wife.

6252
02:41:04,920 --> 02:41:07,150
Hamada

6253
02:41:05,450 --> 02:41:07,150
Hamada

6254
02:41:10,240 --> 02:41:11,020
That's 3 of them

6255
02:41:12,590 --> 02:41:14,020
Why?

6256
02:41:15,270 --> 02:41:16,350
That's great

6257
02:41:16,510 --> 02:41:26,070
The tragedy soon to be summoned by these idols

6258
02:41:16,510 --> 02:41:26,070
remains unknown to the five...

6259
02:41:26,070 --> 02:41:27,470
Who are we starting from?

6260
02:41:27,470 --> 02:41:30,180
Shall I go?

6261
02:41:29,170 --> 02:41:30,170
Ok? Ok

6262
02:41:30,170 --> 02:41:30,830
Ok? Ok

6263
02:41:30,830 --> 02:41:33,690
Starting with the drawers

6264
02:41:34,850 --> 02:41:35,690
Nothing

6265
02:41:36,380 --> 02:41:37,650
Ah!

6266
02:41:38,850 --> 02:41:39,670
A secret?

6267
02:41:40,020 --> 02:41:44,560
Key #3

6268
02:41:41,160 --> 02:41:43,730
#3 has appeared #3?

6269
02:41:43,730 --> 02:41:44,560
Moreover...

6270
02:41:44,840 --> 02:41:45,730
Is that it?

6271
02:41:45,730 --> 02:41:46,660
Ah, that's it

6272
02:41:46,660 --> 02:41:49,360
Guess I should open it

6273
02:41:47,340 --> 02:41:49,360
I guess

6274
02:41:49,500 --> 02:41:50,810
He's going, he's going to do it?

6275
02:41:50,820 --> 02:41:55,030
No, but

6276
02:41:51,200 --> 02:41:52,700
Normally, you'd expect treasure

6277
02:41:52,700 --> 02:41:55,030
Normally, you'd expect treasure

6278
02:41:53,600 --> 02:41:54,420
Sure you would. That's a treasure chest, right?

6279
02:41:54,420 --> 02:41:55,970
Sure you would. That's a treasure chest, right?

6280
02:41:56,300 --> 02:41:59,470
The intriguing #3

6281
02:41:58,440 --> 02:41:59,470
Old-man eyes

6282
02:41:59,520 --> 02:42:00,450
He's so far from it

6283
02:42:01,640 --> 02:42:03,840
It's probably a "PSHHH"

6284
02:42:03,840 --> 02:42:04,590
Yeah

6285
02:42:07,330 --> 02:42:08,730
Nope, it isn't

6286
02:42:08,650 --> 02:42:09,780
Huh?

6287
02:42:09,000 --> 02:42:09,780
What is this?

6288
02:42:10,420 --> 02:42:13,820
Trashcan, tissue

6289
02:42:15,450 --> 02:42:17,450
Kendama

6290
02:42:19,040 --> 02:42:21,910
A bouncy ball, and a ladle

6291
02:42:21,910 --> 02:42:23,460
That's a lot of stuff

6292
02:42:22,190 --> 02:42:27,800
Mysterious assorted goods set

6293
02:42:23,940 --> 02:42:25,140
So what is this?

6294
02:42:25,140 --> 02:42:26,400
What is that?

6295
02:42:25,750 --> 02:42:28,400
What kind of set is this?

6296
02:42:30,740 --> 02:42:35,020
The sacrificial ceremony for the Thai Kick God

6297
02:42:30,740 --> 02:42:41,330
Sacrificial Ceremony!

6298
02:42:30,740 --> 02:42:41,330
The Thai Kick God's

6299
02:42:35,060 --> 02:42:41,330
The name of a sacrifice will be determined, to appease the angry Thai Kick God's rage

6300
02:42:40,900 --> 02:42:41,840
What??

6301
02:42:41,860 --> 02:42:52,890
The 5 will hold a battle to not be the last one standing

6302
02:42:41,860 --> 02:42:52,890
Using these artifacts

6303
02:42:41,860 --> 02:42:58,630
Ceremonial Rules

6304
02:42:41,860 --> 02:42:58,630
m 0 0 l 0 115 940 115 940 0

6305
02:42:52,510 --> 02:42:53,590
Oh, all of us are doing it

6306
02:42:52,590 --> 02:42:58,630
The last loser standing will become a sacrifice to Thai Kick

6307
02:42:58,310 --> 02:42:59,940
This is terrible

6308
02:42:59,280 --> 02:43:02,950
First: Catching the kendama on the first try

6309
02:42:59,710 --> 02:43:00,550
m 0 12 l 300 0 1200 12 300 24

6310
02:42:59,710 --> 02:43:00,550
m 0 12 l 300 0 1200 12 300 24

6311
02:42:59,710 --> 02:43:00,550
m 0 12 l 700 0 1200 12 700 24

6312
02:42:59,710 --> 02:43:02,680
Catch the kendama on the first try

6313
02:43:02,950 --> 02:43:09,440
If you can catch the ball on the middle cup in your first try, you will be victorious

6314
02:43:02,950 --> 02:43:15,110
Catch the kendama on the first try

6315
02:43:02,950 --> 02:43:15,110
T/N: A kendama is a toy with a wooden cross-like shape with a string and ball with a hole. The objective is by only holding on the wooden portion, swing the ball to land in the 3 different cups, and then have the pointed end go into the hole in the ball.

6316
02:43:02,950 --> 02:43:15,110
m 0 0 l 0 82 1200 82 1200 0

6317
02:43:03,230 --> 02:43:06,000
Hang on just a second!

6318
02:43:08,920 --> 02:43:10,110
Hang on!

6319
02:43:09,140 --> 02:43:15,110
Those who fail will remain a loser, and move on to the next round

6320
02:43:15,380 --> 02:43:18,350
This is a tough one

6321
02:43:15,680 --> 02:43:18,350
It's this kind of thing

6322
02:43:19,450 --> 02:43:21,620
Enough with the Thai Kick

6323
02:43:21,620 --> 02:43:22,790
I'll get it on the first try

6324
02:43:22,610 --> 02:43:23,580
This is

6325
02:43:23,600 --> 02:43:24,950
Losers stay in

6326
02:43:24,120 --> 02:43:27,430
There are a lot of other items, too...

6327
02:43:25,130 --> 02:43:26,950
True true true true... True

6328
02:43:26,950 --> 02:43:27,910
That's right

6329
02:43:28,460 --> 02:43:30,900
I'm definitely getting kicked once or twice

6330
02:43:30,900 --> 02:43:32,810
No, I don't think so

6331
02:43:31,340 --> 02:43:33,200
If you can't do this one

6332
02:43:33,200 --> 02:43:34,770
Only one person does

6333
02:43:34,140 --> 02:43:34,920
You continue

6334
02:43:34,770 --> 02:43:36,570
You aren't listening to the rules at all

6335
02:43:40,940 --> 02:43:43,740
Excuse me, Matsumoto, you need to listen...

6336
02:43:43,990 --> 02:43:45,900
You don't listen at all

6337
02:43:45,040 --> 02:43:49,050
I don't always listen well

6338
02:43:49,050 --> 02:43:50,610
Sorry, me too

6339
02:43:50,620 --> 02:43:51,650
Endo's loveless tsukkomi is awful

6340
02:43:51,650 --> 02:43:54,490
Endo's loveless tsukkomi is awful

6341
02:43:52,510 --> 02:43:56,470
Excuse me, but my tsukkomi sounds a lot like "slap slap slap"

6342
02:43:55,150 --> 02:43:56,500
He's getting rude, isn't he? Right?

6343
02:43:56,510 --> 02:43:57,540
He's getting rude, isn't he? Right?

6344
02:43:57,760 --> 02:43:59,460
He's getting rude

6345
02:43:59,460 --> 02:44:01,460
Sorry for speaking so strongly

6346
02:44:02,190 --> 02:44:03,860
Let's do rock paper scissors

6347
02:44:02,910 --> 02:44:03,620
That's it!

6348
02:44:04,230 --> 02:44:06,570
It's important to be first

6349
02:44:05,390 --> 02:44:06,230
It's important

6350
02:44:05,650 --> 02:44:08,230
Really? Come on...

6351
02:44:07,550 --> 02:44:09,100
We're doing rock paper scissors?

6352
02:44:09,410 --> 02:44:11,890
Yeah, will you go first?

6353
02:44:11,070 --> 02:44:12,770
I'll go

6354
02:44:11,930 --> 02:44:13,770
Ah! That's wonderful~

6355
02:44:14,940 --> 02:44:15,770
If you get this, you'll be in a good position

6356
02:44:15,770 --> 02:44:17,780
If you get this, you'll be in a good position

6357
02:44:16,550 --> 02:44:17,290
That'd be an advantage Yeah

6358
02:44:17,300 --> 02:44:17,770
That'd be an advantage Yeah

6359
02:44:17,540 --> 02:44:18,480
For sure

6360
02:44:18,140 --> 02:44:23,050
Actually, if I have good form I wonder if I can do this

6361
02:44:23,350 --> 02:44:26,550
Is it okay if I practice?

6362
02:44:24,220 --> 02:44:26,550
No way!

6363
02:44:24,250 --> 02:44:26,550
Hell no!

6364
02:44:24,650 --> 02:44:26,550
Not a chance!

6365
02:44:24,850 --> 02:44:26,550
Cut that out...

6366
02:44:25,540 --> 02:44:27,920
That was an incredible rejection!

6367
02:44:27,310 --> 02:44:28,870
Obviously we did

6368
02:44:27,920 --> 02:44:31,120
You really told me!

6369
02:44:31,120 --> 02:44:33,520
Goi Goi Su-

6370
02:44:31,120 --> 02:44:33,520
T/N: "Goi Goi Su" is a phrase used by Japanese comedian, Daian, which is used to mean, "Amazing". It comes from the word "Sugoi".

6371
02:44:31,420 --> 02:44:33,520
Goi Goi Su-

6372
02:44:31,720 --> 02:44:33,520
Goi Goi Su-

6373
02:44:34,360 --> 02:44:35,790
Go ahead

6374
02:44:35,360 --> 02:44:37,790
Not laughing at all

6375
02:44:42,830 --> 02:44:45,500
Matsumoto stays in!!

6376
02:44:42,830 --> 02:44:45,500
Matsumoto stays in!!

6377
02:44:49,190 --> 02:44:50,960
Man, I totally laughed

6378
02:44:49,190 --> 02:44:50,960
The way you did that was awful

6379
02:44:51,540 --> 02:44:54,700
The tension and release was incredible

6380
02:44:52,670 --> 02:44:54,700
And he missed

6381
02:44:55,620 --> 02:44:58,420
Seriously, seriously, seriously

6382
02:44:58,450 --> 02:45:00,120
I couldn't summon my normal power

6383
02:45:00,120 --> 02:45:02,490
I couldn't summon my normal power

6384
02:45:01,640 --> 02:45:03,390
Yeah, that's it

6385
02:45:02,240 --> 02:45:03,390
Who's next?

6386
02:45:03,740 --> 02:45:05,140
Endo

6387
02:45:04,240 --> 02:45:05,140
Okay

6388
02:45:05,140 --> 02:45:06,340
Go ahead

6389
02:45:07,000 --> 02:45:07,930
Already it's like...

6390
02:45:07,930 --> 02:45:09,960
Don't take too long

6391
02:45:08,770 --> 02:45:09,960
Yes

6392
02:45:10,140 --> 02:45:11,960
Here I go

6393
02:45:10,650 --> 02:45:11,960
Nice and smooth

6394
02:45:11,960 --> 02:45:13,910
Niceandsmooth!

6395
02:45:13,910 --> 02:45:19,100
Endo wins his way out

6396
02:45:13,910 --> 02:45:19,100
Endo wins his way out

6397
02:45:20,090 --> 02:45:20,900
This is ok, right?

6398
02:45:20,910 --> 02:45:23,840
You kind of looked like you were smiling, though...

6399
02:45:25,290 --> 02:45:27,540
Man, I really don't want a Thai Kick...

6400
02:45:27,050 --> 02:45:28,650
Do you really think you can catch it now?

6401
02:45:28,660 --> 02:45:29,880
Yeah

6402
02:45:29,780 --> 02:45:30,850
Make it snappy

6403
02:45:33,810 --> 02:45:34,940
Amazing!

6404
02:45:34,130 --> 02:45:37,790
Hosei wins his way out

6405
02:45:34,130 --> 02:45:37,790
Hosei wins his way out

6406
02:45:35,100 --> 02:45:36,490
He caught it?

6407
02:45:36,490 --> 02:45:38,270
Tanaka

6408
02:45:37,140 --> 02:45:38,270
Okay

6409
02:45:38,270 --> 02:45:40,030
Hell yeah!

6410
02:45:40,040 --> 02:45:41,990
Hell yeah!

6411
02:45:40,640 --> 02:45:42,260
No no no

6412
02:45:44,200 --> 02:45:45,610
He slipped

6413
02:45:45,610 --> 02:45:47,860
You said "yeah!"

6414
02:45:47,870 --> 02:45:50,000
But you were smiling like normal when you said it

6415
02:45:49,420 --> 02:45:50,980
You caught it?

6416
02:45:51,540 --> 02:45:52,840
But that's just fiiine~

6417
02:45:51,540 --> 02:45:54,770
But yeah, but yeah, but yeah, yeah, it's okay

6418
02:45:52,840 --> 02:45:55,040
But that's just fiiine~

6419
02:45:57,010 --> 02:45:58,960
That's pissing me off

6420
02:45:57,780 --> 02:45:59,210
Here I go

6421
02:45:59,540 --> 02:46:01,030
I get it already

6422
02:46:03,060 --> 02:46:06,930
Tanaka wins his way out!!

6423
02:46:03,060 --> 02:46:06,930
Tanaka wins his way out!!

6424
02:46:03,340 --> 02:46:05,950
You've got to be kidding

6425
02:46:11,340 --> 02:46:14,390
That's totally fine

6426
02:46:11,890 --> 02:46:14,390
I don't mind at all

6427
02:46:14,390 --> 02:46:15,530
Taking this one spank

6428
02:46:15,530 --> 02:46:17,700
This one spank, I don't mind at all

6429
02:46:16,040 --> 02:46:18,660
This is fine, too

6430
02:46:19,330 --> 02:46:20,880
Oh, okay

6431
02:46:20,200 --> 02:46:22,270
OK OK Thank you!

6432
02:46:21,310 --> 02:46:22,600
Thanks!

6433
02:46:22,810 --> 02:46:26,470
Hold on, hold on- something's off

6434
02:46:24,130 --> 02:46:26,470
No that's okay

6435
02:46:27,540 --> 02:46:28,510
I suck at this

6436
02:46:28,510 --> 02:46:30,380
I suck at this

6437
02:46:29,340 --> 02:46:31,680
But Hamada, if you get it

6438
02:46:29,340 --> 02:46:31,680
No no

6439
02:46:31,680 --> 02:46:32,740
Go quick, go quick

6440
02:46:33,490 --> 02:46:35,730
THREE, TWO, ONE

6441
02:46:34,130 --> 02:46:35,510
Hold on a second

6442
02:46:35,730 --> 02:46:37,780
THREE, TWO, ONE

6443
02:46:37,790 --> 02:46:39,080
THREE, TWO, ONE

6444
02:46:40,830 --> 02:46:41,850
OUCH!

6445
02:46:41,840 --> 02:46:45,470
He missed it!

6446
02:46:42,340 --> 02:46:45,420
Hamada stays in!!

6447
02:46:42,340 --> 02:46:45,420
Hamada stays in!!

6448
02:46:55,970 --> 02:46:58,570
What the hell was that?

6449
02:46:58,470 --> 02:46:59,800
It hurts. My geriatric shoulders hurt.

6450
02:46:59,800 --> 02:47:01,940
It's really heavy

6451
02:47:00,370 --> 02:47:02,410
Well, that's it for the kendama

6452
02:47:03,210 --> 02:47:04,910
Just Downtown remains

6453
02:47:05,130 --> 02:47:08,880
Ladle bouncy ball catch

6454
02:47:05,340 --> 02:47:08,880
Ladle bouncy ball catch

6455
02:47:07,520 --> 02:47:09,270
What?

6456
02:47:09,180 --> 02:47:16,650
Hard enough that it bounces above your own height

6457
02:47:09,180 --> 02:47:16,650
Throw the bouncy ball against the ground.

6458
02:47:09,180 --> 02:47:20,690
Ladle bouncy ball catch

6459
02:47:09,180 --> 02:47:20,690
m 0 0 l 0 100 980 100 980 0

6460
02:47:13,060 --> 02:47:13,950
Oh!

6461
02:47:16,320 --> 02:47:20,690
If you can catch it the first time, you will be removed from the challenge

6462
02:47:20,690 --> 02:47:23,560
That's pretty hard though...

6463
02:47:22,690 --> 02:47:25,530
To get it above your head, you really want to toss it

6464
02:47:23,790 --> 02:47:24,960
Yeah, above

6465
02:47:24,960 --> 02:47:26,600
If you don't use enough strength

6466
02:47:26,600 --> 02:47:29,200
Hey Endo, show us how it's done

6467
02:47:27,980 --> 02:47:29,200
Okay

6468
02:47:29,200 --> 02:47:31,200
Just now you were saying to give a good toss

6469
02:47:29,810 --> 02:47:31,200
Speaking of which

6470
02:47:31,370 --> 02:47:32,640
So are we resetting now?

6471
02:47:32,640 --> 02:47:34,320
So are we resetting now?

6472
02:47:33,830 --> 02:47:36,240
We're not resetting

6473
02:47:34,900 --> 02:47:39,140
No, that would be- well, sorry

6474
02:47:35,770 --> 02:47:38,140
Are we resetting?

6475
02:47:39,140 --> 02:47:41,410
Even if you're my senpai, that would be...

6476
02:47:40,610 --> 02:47:41,060
Yeah  Yeah

6477
02:47:41,060 --> 02:47:41,770
Yeah  Yeah

6478
02:47:41,420 --> 02:47:42,480
Well, if it were me

6479
02:47:42,480 --> 02:47:43,280
I would reset, even if I had won

6480
02:47:43,280 --> 02:47:45,150
I would reset, even if I had won

6481
02:47:45,150 --> 02:47:49,690
You may have seniority, but the rules say the losers continue on...

6482
02:47:46,140 --> 02:47:46,800
Yeah

6483
02:47:46,800 --> 02:47:48,390
That's...

6484
02:47:48,030 --> 02:47:48,450
Yeah

6485
02:47:48,450 --> 02:47:53,360
Senior or junior doesn't even come into it.

6486
02:47:50,160 --> 02:47:51,670
It's not seniority

6487
02:47:51,260 --> 02:47:53,360
For the rules and

6488
02:47:52,260 --> 02:47:53,360
Right

6489
02:47:52,810 --> 02:47:55,330
for the game, why don't you try it?

6490
02:47:55,640 --> 02:47:58,160
Sorry

6491
02:47:56,690 --> 02:47:58,960
Tanaka would be best at it, wouldn't he?

6492
02:47:58,240 --> 02:47:59,610
Tanaka would

6493
02:47:58,960 --> 02:48:01,300
Tanaka will you do it for us?

6494
02:48:01,300 --> 02:48:03,300
"Tanaka does it?"

6495
02:48:03,770 --> 02:48:04,840
Does what?

6496
02:48:04,940 --> 02:48:07,510
The Thai Kick

6497
02:48:06,140 --> 02:48:07,490
Thai Kick? Me?

6498
02:48:07,780 --> 02:48:08,640
Yes

6499
02:48:08,640 --> 02:48:10,910
What are you saying?

6500
02:48:09,610 --> 02:48:10,910
I don't really have any objections...

6501
02:48:10,910 --> 02:48:12,910
What are you saying?

6502
02:48:11,740 --> 02:48:12,910
Well, you're used to it

6503
02:48:12,910 --> 02:48:14,130
You always get it

6504
02:48:13,720 --> 02:48:15,530
Even if I do always get it

6505
02:48:14,480 --> 02:48:17,180
We want to see your technique in this area

6506
02:48:15,960 --> 02:48:17,180
Exactly

6507
02:48:17,610 --> 02:48:19,580
Thai kicks aren't my technique or anything

6508
02:48:19,580 --> 02:48:21,690
You've mastered them

6509
02:48:21,690 --> 02:48:23,920
Right? Right?

6510
02:48:21,690 --> 02:48:24,460
It's freaking hilarious too

6511
02:48:23,920 --> 02:48:24,460
Right? Right?

6512
02:48:25,290 --> 02:48:27,230
Hey!!

6513
02:48:27,230 --> 02:48:28,590
Hey!!

6514
02:48:28,590 --> 02:48:30,700
Hosei, what do you think?

6515
02:48:31,500 --> 02:48:33,550
I, uh...

6516
02:48:33,550 --> 02:48:35,430
Just this once, I'd like to be quiet

6517
02:48:35,120 --> 02:48:41,870
Just this once, I'd like to be quiet

6518
02:48:37,750 --> 02:48:41,870
and be myself

6519
02:48:39,920 --> 02:48:41,890
Apologies

6520
02:48:40,380 --> 02:48:41,890
What's that mean?

6521
02:48:42,940 --> 02:48:44,570
He left Tanaka out to dry

6522
02:48:47,110 --> 02:48:49,580
Oh come on, I was safe there!

6523
02:48:49,580 --> 02:48:51,620
Just wait another minute!

6524
02:48:54,820 --> 02:48:57,320
What does that mean? "Be myself"?

6525
02:48:55,580 --> 02:48:57,320
I hate those damn Thai Kicks

6526
02:48:57,630 --> 02:48:59,320
I still don't get it

6527
02:49:01,590 --> 02:49:03,390
Endo, try it

6528
02:49:02,770 --> 02:49:05,390
Right right right- perhaps you can't do it

6529
02:49:05,390 --> 02:49:06,830
I'll try to get it the first time

6530
02:49:09,770 --> 02:49:11,540
Just like that

6531
02:49:10,280 --> 02:49:12,800
Despite his terrible vision, too!

6532
02:49:12,180 --> 02:49:12,800
Right?

6533
02:49:12,580 --> 02:49:13,370
Just like this

6534
02:49:13,370 --> 02:49:14,840
It's easy

6535
02:49:14,040 --> 02:49:16,000
You say that

6536
02:49:14,640 --> 02:49:16,000
It's really easy

6537
02:49:16,590 --> 02:49:18,390
It's just like that

6538
02:49:17,540 --> 02:49:18,390
Very well done

6539
02:49:18,640 --> 02:49:20,390
It has to go above the shoulder?

6540
02:49:20,640 --> 02:49:21,930
Just above your head

6541
02:49:21,280 --> 02:49:23,110
Above your head

6542
02:49:21,930 --> 02:49:22,430
Above the head?  Yeah

6543
02:49:22,430 --> 02:49:23,110
Above the head?  Yeah

6544
02:49:23,110 --> 02:49:25,110
I really hate this

6545
02:49:28,690 --> 02:49:36,390
The rip-roaring second half

6546
02:49:30,420 --> 02:49:36,390
No Laughing Treasure Hunters

6547
02:49:36,390 --> 02:49:36,910
Famous Actor

6548
02:49:36,390 --> 02:49:42,300
Famous actors compete one after another

6549
02:49:36,390 --> 02:49:42,300
Famous actors compete one after another

6550
02:49:36,910 --> 02:49:37,260
Famous Actor

6551
02:49:37,260 --> 02:49:39,260
Famous Actor

6552
02:49:43,600 --> 02:49:44,500
Big Name
Celebrity

6553
02:49:43,600 --> 02:49:44,500
YOU?!!

6554
02:49:44,500 --> 02:49:46,740
What are you making them do?!

6555
02:49:46,850 --> 02:49:48,540
You're a descendant aren't you!!

6556
02:49:47,540 --> 02:49:48,540
No sir

6557
02:49:48,810 --> 02:49:52,010
A big chance to avoid a slap

6558
02:49:48,810 --> 02:49:52,010
Hosei's arch-nemesis Chono's appearance

6559
02:49:52,060 --> 02:49:52,340
I drank it!I drank it!

6560
02:49:52,340 --> 02:49:54,050
I drank it! I drank it!

6561
02:49:54,050 --> 02:49:55,850
Hellish stories!!

6562
02:49:56,080 --> 02:50:01,820
Downtown is attacked!?

6563
02:49:56,080 --> 02:50:01,820
Late Night Treasure Hunters

6564
02:49:56,320 --> 02:49:58,820
While searching for treasure late at night

6565
02:49:58,820 --> 02:50:01,820
We'll find out what attacks Downtown!

6566
02:50:02,020 --> 02:50:05,760
Keep watching until the climax!!

6567
02:50:05,760 --> 02:50:07,760
Above the shoulder?

6568
02:50:07,940 --> 02:50:09,140
Above the head

6569
02:50:08,490 --> 02:50:10,460
Above your head

6570
02:50:09,140 --> 02:50:09,640
Above the head?     Yes

6571
02:50:09,640 --> 02:50:10,460
Above the head?     Yes

6572
02:50:10,460 --> 02:50:12,420
Really? There's no way...

6573
02:50:17,050 --> 02:50:20,570
Hamada stays in!!

6574
02:50:17,050 --> 02:50:20,570
Hamada stays in!!

6575
02:50:20,550 --> 02:50:25,260
That wasn't even close!

6576
02:50:28,240 --> 02:50:30,960
Oh no. That was awful

6577
02:50:30,950 --> 02:50:31,950
Oh no. That was awful

6578
02:50:31,950 --> 02:50:37,340
Even the way you lost... Was bad. It was pathetic

6579
02:50:34,420 --> 02:50:37,350
That was awful! Very pathetic

6580
02:50:37,560 --> 02:50:39,460
"Forever impossible" is how that felt

6581
02:50:39,460 --> 02:50:42,290
You were playing it like you pass the ball to your opponent

6582
02:50:41,040 --> 02:50:43,040
Yes, for his opponent...

6583
02:50:42,510 --> 02:50:44,260
Next to him

6584
02:50:43,040 --> 02:50:44,260
So now

6585
02:50:44,260 --> 02:50:46,560
Hold on, how did you get it Endo?

6586
02:50:46,560 --> 02:50:49,100
Keep your eye on the ball

6587
02:50:55,520 --> 02:50:58,810
Matsumoto stays in!!

6588
02:50:55,520 --> 02:50:58,810
Matsumoto stays in!!

6589
02:50:57,350 --> 02:50:58,730
He couldn't do it either!

6590
02:51:03,660 --> 02:51:04,580
Seriously

6591
02:51:08,450 --> 02:51:11,120
It wasn't even above his head

6592
02:51:09,580 --> 02:51:10,980
Oh come on

6593
02:51:11,000 --> 02:51:12,560
Give me a break

6594
02:51:13,750 --> 02:51:15,960
Oh, the next stage

6595
02:51:15,980 --> 02:51:16,810
m 0 12 l 300 0 1200 12 300 24

6596
02:51:15,980 --> 02:51:16,810
m 0 12 l 300 0 1200 12 300 24

6597
02:51:15,980 --> 02:51:16,810
m 0 12 l 700 0 1200 12 700 24

6598
02:51:15,980 --> 02:51:20,000
The last ceremony - trashcan tissue shoot

6599
02:51:15,980 --> 02:51:20,930
Trashcan Tissue Shoot

6600
02:51:19,440 --> 02:51:21,870
But that's hard

6601
02:51:21,210 --> 02:51:26,020
Using as many tissues wadded up as you like

6602
02:51:21,210 --> 02:51:34,140
Trashcan Tissue Shoot

6603
02:51:21,210 --> 02:51:34,150
m 0 0 l 0 100 980 100 980 0

6604
02:51:22,270 --> 02:51:26,800
Using as many wadded up tissues as you like

6605
02:51:25,570 --> 02:51:34,150
If you can get it the first time, you'll win your safety

6606
02:51:25,570 --> 02:51:34,150
T/N: 2 meters is about 6ft 6 in.

6607
02:51:25,570 --> 02:51:34,150
Throw the wad into the trashcan on the desk from about 2m

6608
02:51:28,150 --> 02:51:29,740
2 meters

6609
02:51:28,760 --> 02:51:29,740
2 METERS?!

6610
02:51:32,340 --> 02:51:34,150
I'm telling you this is too hard

6611
02:51:34,150 --> 02:51:35,950
So, let's all go in order

6612
02:51:35,950 --> 02:51:37,580
Let's start with Tanaka

6613
02:51:36,530 --> 02:51:37,580
What? Why?

6614
02:51:37,580 --> 02:51:39,420
That doesn't make sense

6615
02:51:39,420 --> 02:51:40,650
It's just you two, right?

6616
02:51:40,070 --> 02:51:40,660
Yeah

6617
02:51:40,650 --> 02:51:42,620
How far is 2 meters?

6618
02:51:41,240 --> 02:51:44,220
Let's get it ready

6619
02:51:42,840 --> 02:51:44,220
This should be about it, right?

6620
02:51:45,840 --> 02:51:46,290
More or less     Okay

6621
02:51:46,300 --> 02:51:46,820
More or less     Okay

6622
02:51:48,940 --> 02:51:50,680
So which of you is doing it?

6623
02:51:49,400 --> 02:51:50,690
It's ready

6624
02:51:50,500 --> 02:51:52,960
Is Endo first up to try?

6625
02:51:51,250 --> 02:51:52,960
I'm not going, though

6626
02:51:52,960 --> 02:51:54,160
But the reset?

6627
02:51:54,160 --> 02:51:56,800
We said we were resetting, though!

6628
02:51:56,800 --> 02:51:59,670
Well, like we told you

6629
02:51:59,670 --> 02:52:02,670
The rules say it's you two in sudden-death

6630
02:52:01,910 --> 02:52:05,110
Right, it said that-

6631
02:52:05,110 --> 02:52:06,740
But it said we were all doing it

6632
02:52:07,360 --> 02:52:08,710
It's just you two

6633
02:52:08,710 --> 02:52:10,110
It said that, but

6634
02:52:10,110 --> 02:52:12,550
Shouldn't we all do it?

6635
02:52:19,740 --> 02:52:21,060
It's like you didn't listen

6636
02:52:21,060 --> 02:52:22,050
Why would we go?

6637
02:52:21,840 --> 02:52:23,690
Let's get the tissues

6638
02:52:23,030 --> 02:52:24,860
Let's get this over with already

6639
02:52:23,960 --> 02:52:28,460
As many as you want

6640
02:52:24,860 --> 02:52:26,110
It would be best if we all did it

6641
02:52:26,100 --> 02:52:28,130
It would be best if we all did it

6642
02:52:26,100 --> 02:52:30,730
How many sheets of paper? It is sudden death after all...

6643
02:52:30,720 --> 02:52:31,700
If we did that

6644
02:52:31,700 --> 02:52:32,420
The viewers would be upset, probably

6645
02:52:32,400 --> 02:52:33,740
The viewers would be upset, probably

6646
02:52:33,040 --> 02:52:33,740
That's right

6647
02:52:33,800 --> 02:52:34,990
Be upset?    Yes

6648
02:52:34,990 --> 02:52:35,460
Be upset?    Yes

6649
02:52:35,240 --> 02:52:37,680
I don't know what you mean

6650
02:52:36,910 --> 02:52:38,310
I have no idea what you mean

6651
02:52:38,320 --> 02:52:41,250
The person being sacrificed hasn't been decided

6652
02:52:41,540 --> 02:52:42,960
The losers keep competing

6653
02:52:43,320 --> 02:52:45,580
That means it's a fight between you two!

6654
02:52:45,580 --> 02:52:48,650
Then you should do it, moron

6655
02:52:45,580 --> 02:52:48,650
💢

6656
02:52:49,100 --> 02:52:50,650
It's what I've been saying, goddamnit

6657
02:52:49,100 --> 02:52:54,830
T/N: It's hard to translate, but Hamada's Osaka dialect is coming out in a really harsh and angry way.

6658
02:52:53,290 --> 02:52:54,830
YOU HEAR ME?!!

6659
02:52:55,200 --> 02:52:56,130
He's scary

6660
02:52:56,530 --> 02:52:59,330
WHY DON'T YOU JUST DO IT, MORON?!

6661
02:52:56,530 --> 02:52:59,330
💢

6662
02:53:04,100 --> 02:53:06,070
He's crazy

6663
02:53:05,460 --> 02:53:08,570
That's a crazy turn of events

6664
02:53:07,040 --> 02:53:07,890
There's a really bad atmosphere now

6665
02:53:07,870 --> 02:53:09,910
There's a really bad atmosphere now

6666
02:53:08,240 --> 02:53:09,520
Crazy for sure

6667
02:53:10,810 --> 02:53:13,010
Of course the atmosphere would get bad

6668
02:53:13,740 --> 02:53:15,880
So, let's all do it!!

6669
02:53:15,000 --> 02:53:15,500
No...

6670
02:53:15,500 --> 02:53:17,980
Oh, I've got it! So, uh...

6671
02:53:17,980 --> 02:53:19,730
You just do it, but you aren't in the competition

6672
02:53:19,720 --> 02:53:22,090
You just do it, but you aren't in the competition

6673
02:53:21,400 --> 02:53:22,090
That's good

6674
02:53:22,090 --> 02:53:23,320
Just for fun?

6675
02:53:23,330 --> 02:53:24,640
We wouldn't be competing?

6676
02:53:24,840 --> 02:53:25,990
That should be fine...

6677
02:53:25,250 --> 02:53:27,470
If it's just the two of us...

6678
02:53:26,760 --> 02:53:28,960
It's not funny then

6679
02:53:27,710 --> 02:53:29,440
It just wouldn't really work

6680
02:53:28,960 --> 02:53:30,900
It would just look like old people playing...

6681
02:53:30,900 --> 02:53:31,940
That's embarrassing

6682
02:53:31,940 --> 02:53:32,960
You say it's embarrassing

6683
02:53:32,960 --> 02:53:34,800
But we were so desperate in getting it done

6684
02:53:34,800 --> 02:53:35,960
Let's go from Endo

6685
02:53:35,050 --> 02:53:38,730
Okay, but we aren't in the competition

6686
02:53:35,920 --> 02:53:39,710
We aren't competing

6687
02:53:38,740 --> 02:53:40,140
It's just you two

6688
02:53:41,310 --> 02:53:43,770
How are you throwing that?

6689
02:53:41,310 --> 02:53:43,770
Underhanded? Throw it overhanded...

6690
02:53:43,770 --> 02:53:44,840
Throw it overhand!

6691
02:53:44,840 --> 02:53:46,380
The VTR did it overhanded too

6692
02:53:46,380 --> 02:53:49,040
On the VTR

6693
02:53:48,350 --> 02:53:50,110
Oh, the VTR did it overhanded

6694
02:53:50,110 --> 02:53:52,720
So that means you were actually paying attention...

6695
02:53:52,720 --> 02:53:53,370
Wow, how dare you talk to him like that...

6696
02:53:53,350 --> 02:53:55,650
Wow, how dare you talk to him like that...

6697
02:53:54,400 --> 02:53:55,650
Right?

6698
02:54:00,740 --> 02:54:02,250
If that's how you're going to talk to me

6699
02:54:02,230 --> 02:54:03,710
I'm sorry

6700
02:54:03,450 --> 02:54:04,900
Now I don't feel like doing this

6701
02:54:06,300 --> 02:54:08,030
I'm sorry about that Hamada-san,

6702
02:54:07,630 --> 02:54:10,870
If you talk like that to me

6703
02:54:08,330 --> 02:54:12,280
Calm down, let's just cool down a bit

6704
02:54:11,300 --> 02:54:14,250
Okay fine - how about you just try it now?

6705
02:54:13,440 --> 02:54:15,230
Try it

6706
02:54:14,040 --> 02:54:14,760
Starting with me?    Yeah

6707
02:54:14,760 --> 02:54:15,230
Starting with me?    Yeah

6708
02:54:15,230 --> 02:54:16,440
It has to be overhand

6709
02:54:15,850 --> 02:54:18,440
Has to be overhand?

6710
02:54:17,210 --> 02:54:18,440
It has to be overhand

6711
02:54:17,380 --> 02:54:18,440
Gotta be

6712
02:54:18,610 --> 02:54:20,610
You won't get a second chance, Endo

6713
02:54:21,940 --> 02:54:23,200
Hurry the hell up

6714
02:54:30,220 --> 02:54:32,520
Isn't this supposed to be a fun game?

6715
02:54:32,530 --> 02:54:34,160
It isn't fun!

6716
02:54:33,340 --> 02:54:35,470
Yeah, that's great

6717
02:54:36,130 --> 02:54:37,860
It isn't fun at all!

6718
02:54:38,600 --> 02:54:39,940
Don't do that stuff

6719
02:54:39,840 --> 02:54:40,880
You can't do that!

6720
02:54:40,050 --> 02:54:44,070
Right, right, right

6721
02:54:41,060 --> 02:54:46,000
It wasn't like that with the kendama and stuff. This isn't fun!

6722
02:54:45,390 --> 02:54:46,000
Do it lightly

6723
02:54:46,000 --> 02:54:48,740
Try it lightly

6724
02:54:47,570 --> 02:54:50,740
Throw it lightly?

6725
02:54:49,210 --> 02:54:51,170
Throw it lightly

6726
02:54:50,210 --> 02:54:51,940
Throw it with the intention of getting it in

6727
02:54:51,940 --> 02:54:52,910
Yes, of course

6728
02:54:52,910 --> 02:54:53,740
Here I go

6729
02:54:57,330 --> 02:55:02,450
Endo wins his way out!!

6730
02:54:57,330 --> 02:55:02,450
Endo wins his way out!!

6731
02:54:58,140 --> 02:54:59,230
You got it?!

6732
02:54:58,910 --> 02:55:00,420
Endo...

6733
02:55:00,680 --> 02:55:02,450
I mean, I did play baseball

6734
02:55:01,600 --> 02:55:02,690
Why did you make it in?

6735
02:55:02,450 --> 02:55:05,190
Endo takes it all

6736
02:55:03,880 --> 02:55:05,610
Endo takes this whole game

6737
02:55:05,610 --> 02:55:06,980
Well, that's-

6738
02:55:06,350 --> 02:55:06,980
He took it all

6739
02:55:06,980 --> 02:55:08,150
It's all Endo

6740
02:55:09,130 --> 02:55:12,500
I've never seen you take a Thai Kick

6741
02:55:10,660 --> 02:55:11,520
Oh, you're right!

6742
02:55:11,520 --> 02:55:13,760
That's not true - I won in all of these challenges

6743
02:55:12,480 --> 02:55:13,510
Really

6744
02:55:13,930 --> 02:55:15,540
I doubt that...

6745
02:55:16,530 --> 02:55:17,540
Um... It has nothing to do with this...

6746
02:55:17,900 --> 02:55:19,800
Hurry the hell up!

6747
02:55:17,900 --> 02:55:19,800
💢

6748
02:55:24,970 --> 02:55:26,320
Come on~!

6749
02:55:28,200 --> 02:55:30,000
Oh come on~!

6750
02:55:30,040 --> 02:55:31,680
This isn't fun at all

6751
02:55:31,280 --> 02:55:33,520
Are you really that surprised?

6752
02:55:35,930 --> 02:55:37,990
Probably it was only Hosei-san who was surprised

6753
02:55:38,220 --> 02:55:40,320
He was really surprised

6754
02:55:43,530 --> 02:55:47,560
Hosei wins his way out!!

6755
02:55:43,530 --> 02:55:47,560
Hosei wins his way out!!

6756
02:55:48,780 --> 02:55:51,030
You got in position quickly

6757
02:55:51,270 --> 02:55:53,940
You got in position quickly

6758
02:55:55,070 --> 02:55:55,970
Tanaka

6759
02:55:56,490 --> 02:55:57,590
Good luck

6760
02:56:00,340 --> 02:56:00,990
Do your best

6761
02:56:01,600 --> 02:56:02,310
Okay

6762
02:56:02,600 --> 02:56:03,610
With this one

6763
02:56:03,610 --> 02:56:06,420
Tanaka's reach is an advantage

6764
02:56:05,480 --> 02:56:06,420
That's true

6765
02:56:09,620 --> 02:56:14,560
Tanaka wins his way out!!

6766
02:56:09,620 --> 02:56:14,560
Tanaka wins his way out!!

6767
02:56:10,610 --> 02:56:12,410
What a dumb way to throw...

6768
02:56:15,920 --> 02:56:18,270
Why did you make it in?!

6769
02:56:18,790 --> 02:56:21,690
What? What is this?

6770
02:56:28,560 --> 02:56:29,460
What the hell?

6771
02:56:29,940 --> 02:56:33,080
LET'S HAVE SOME FREAKING FUN!!

6772
02:56:30,920 --> 02:56:33,080
Let's have some fun

6773
02:56:31,640 --> 02:56:34,160
Yes, let's have some fun

6774
02:56:33,080 --> 02:56:36,350
ALRIGHT?!!

6775
02:56:33,440 --> 02:56:36,000
Let's have fun

6776
02:56:34,360 --> 02:56:36,000
Let's have fun

6777
02:56:35,340 --> 02:56:36,750
Which one?

6778
02:56:36,880 --> 02:56:38,850
Which should we start with?

6779
02:56:37,860 --> 02:56:38,530
I don't care     Yeah

6780
02:56:38,530 --> 02:56:38,850
I don't care     Yeah

6781
02:56:39,010 --> 02:56:40,520
Okay, I'll go last

6782
02:56:40,520 --> 02:56:43,150
Hamada-san, so you're going first?

6783
02:56:43,150 --> 02:56:44,560
Wadding this up is a pain

6784
02:56:48,060 --> 02:56:49,050
Teehee, this is great

6785
02:56:52,610 --> 02:56:56,030
Hamada wins his way out!!

6786
02:56:52,610 --> 02:56:56,030
Hamada wins his way out!!

6787
02:57:11,280 --> 02:57:13,100
Wait, hold on

6788
02:57:13,130 --> 02:57:14,560
Hang on a second

6789
02:57:14,420 --> 02:57:16,560
I was telling them to wait...

6790
02:57:15,660 --> 02:57:16,550
You were

6791
02:57:18,610 --> 02:57:19,490
Well, then

6792
02:57:19,490 --> 02:57:20,830
If you get it in we'll all do it again

6793
02:57:20,830 --> 02:57:22,010
It's down to this

6794
02:57:20,830 --> 02:57:22,390
If you get it in we'll all do it again

6795
02:57:22,390 --> 02:57:24,300
If he gets it in

6796
02:57:24,300 --> 02:57:25,930
We'll all do it again

6797
02:57:25,490 --> 02:57:26,340
If you get it in

6798
02:57:28,170 --> 02:57:29,440
For real?

6799
02:57:33,670 --> 02:57:35,310
Pfft

6800
02:57:38,850 --> 02:57:40,880
What? No! NO!

6801
02:57:40,880 --> 02:57:42,370
Are you serious?!

6802
02:57:41,180 --> 02:57:42,370
That hurts!

6803
02:57:42,370 --> 02:57:43,840
I'm fine without it

6804
02:57:45,710 --> 02:57:46,820
I'm fine with it

6805
02:57:46,840 --> 02:57:48,210
That's just painful

6806
02:57:47,740 --> 02:57:49,240
I'm fine with it

6807
02:57:48,290 --> 02:57:51,170
COME ONNNNN

6808
02:57:50,540 --> 02:57:52,020
Seriously, I'm fine with it

6809
02:57:52,020 --> 02:57:53,290
Wait just a minute

6810
02:57:53,290 --> 02:57:55,630
Does that mean?

6811
02:57:54,000 --> 02:57:54,970
I hate it

6812
02:57:54,970 --> 02:57:56,930
That means it's Matsumoto-san

6813
02:57:58,900 --> 02:58:01,770
No, but-

6814
02:58:01,770 --> 02:58:03,770
Not this

6815
02:58:03,770 --> 02:58:05,700
No, really? No wait!

6816
02:58:05,770 --> 02:58:07,090
The Thai Kick isn't necessary, right?

6817
02:58:07,070 --> 02:58:09,540
The Thai Kick isn't necessary, right?

6818
02:58:07,770 --> 02:58:08,760
He's here!

6819
02:58:08,760 --> 02:58:09,730
He came

6820
02:58:09,940 --> 02:58:11,540
Seriously?

6821
02:58:10,420 --> 02:58:11,550
Matsumoto-san!

6822
02:58:11,550 --> 02:58:13,130
This will hurt like crazy!

6823
02:58:12,510 --> 02:58:14,550
It's been a while, hasn't it?

6824
02:58:14,550 --> 02:58:16,230
It'll be bad if you don't go to a wide open area

6825
02:58:15,530 --> 02:58:16,660
IT HASN'T BEEN A WHILE!

6826
02:58:16,340 --> 02:58:17,240
Look out

6827
02:58:17,100 --> 02:58:18,330
IT HASN'T BEEN A WHILE!

6828
02:58:18,340 --> 02:58:18,980
Watch out

6829
02:58:20,630 --> 02:58:22,490
AAAHHHHH!!

6830
02:58:23,200 --> 02:58:25,220
AAAHHHHH!!

6831
02:58:29,690 --> 02:58:32,000
Aah that hurts!

6832
02:58:40,190 --> 02:58:41,470
Aah it hurts!

6833
02:58:40,590 --> 02:58:41,640
Can't help it

6834
02:58:45,660 --> 02:58:48,070
Wow, that hurts, huh?

6835
02:58:46,670 --> 02:58:48,070
Tanaka, it hurts!

6836
02:58:48,090 --> 02:58:50,980
I told you, it really hurts!

6837
02:58:59,720 --> 02:59:01,200
Amazing

6838
02:59:00,660 --> 02:59:02,260
Hosei is seriously laughing

6839
02:59:01,680 --> 02:59:04,260
He's laughing really hard

6840
02:59:06,470 --> 02:59:08,050
You're really enjoying this

6841
02:59:07,570 --> 02:59:09,740
I'm not enjoying it

6842
02:59:09,870 --> 02:59:16,710
Thai Kicks in the Batsu Game

6843
02:59:12,340 --> 02:59:16,710
should be banned forever

6844
02:59:13,790 --> 02:59:16,710
You're so right

6845
02:59:14,870 --> 02:59:16,710
Well...

6846
02:59:17,310 --> 02:59:19,480
Tanaka, are you going?

6847
02:59:18,690 --> 02:59:19,810
Oh that's right

6848
02:59:19,810 --> 02:59:22,580
We didn't finish it

6849
02:59:20,220 --> 02:59:21,920
This is only the second one

6850
02:59:21,920 --> 02:59:23,560
Ugh I'm tired...

6851
02:59:22,230 --> 02:59:24,770
That's right, we didn't finish

6852
02:59:25,380 --> 02:59:28,950
Key #1

6853
02:59:26,440 --> 02:59:28,950
This is insane

6854
02:59:28,950 --> 02:59:32,490
The problems keep piling up!

6855
02:59:32,660 --> 02:59:34,490
You're so annoying

6856
02:59:34,740 --> 02:59:36,190
Here I go

6857
02:59:36,810 --> 02:59:38,300
Wait, here?

6858
02:59:37,880 --> 02:59:39,560
Obviously!

6859
02:59:42,670 --> 02:59:43,940
It opens that up     Yes

6860
02:59:43,930 --> 02:59:44,760
It opens that up     Yes

6861
02:59:46,140 --> 02:59:46,980
Again?

6862
02:59:47,250 --> 02:59:49,380
"A traditional feast of my tribe"

6863
02:59:49,640 --> 02:59:51,510
"Please accept this humble meal"

6864
02:59:50,540 --> 02:59:51,510
This is-

6865
02:59:51,510 --> 02:59:52,910
"Headhunter tribe"?

6866
02:59:52,260 --> 02:59:52,910
Scary

6867
02:59:52,910 --> 02:59:59,680
Headhunter Tribe's Feast

6868
02:59:53,340 --> 02:59:54,540
Is it heavy?

6869
02:59:54,740 --> 02:59:56,740
Well, it has some weight to it

6870
02:59:56,740 --> 02:59:58,740
It's frozen right? Something's coming out

6871
02:59:58,740 --> 03:00:00,670
It looks like dry ice

6872
03:00:00,720 --> 03:00:02,350
It's frozen?

6873
03:00:02,740 --> 03:00:04,640
Oh come on, this is scary...

6874
03:00:04,640 --> 03:00:06,280
I'm opening it

6875
03:00:10,830 --> 03:00:11,790
What's this?

6876
03:00:10,830 --> 03:00:13,330
What?

6877
03:00:12,060 --> 03:00:13,330
Scary...

6878
03:00:13,450 --> 03:00:15,030
This is kinda scary

6879
03:00:15,030 --> 03:00:15,870
What's that?

6880
03:00:15,870 --> 03:00:20,940
"Lift it together with its plate", it says...

6881
03:00:19,630 --> 03:00:20,950
What does it mean?

6882
03:00:20,990 --> 03:00:22,950
It's so cold

6883
03:00:23,270 --> 03:00:27,540
If it's from the headhunter tribe... Is it a head?

6884
03:00:33,080 --> 03:00:33,870
No way

6885
03:00:38,140 --> 03:00:40,860
Just gimme a break, come on

6886
03:00:40,860 --> 03:00:42,560
What the hell?

6887
03:00:41,890 --> 03:00:45,330
Monkey-Hamada's head

6888
03:00:42,630 --> 03:00:44,080
What's that?

6889
03:00:43,080 --> 03:00:44,080
Geez

6890
03:00:45,060 --> 03:00:46,950
Really, what's with this?

6891
03:00:47,550 --> 03:00:50,750
What's this? For real, what the heck

6892
03:00:47,550 --> 03:00:50,750
Yeah, what the--

6893
03:00:48,630 --> 03:00:50,750
This is incredible

6894
03:00:50,800 --> 03:00:52,970
Do we have to eat this thing?

6895
03:00:52,240 --> 03:00:53,390
We can't eat this

6896
03:00:52,570 --> 03:00:53,390
Yeah...

6897
03:00:53,820 --> 03:00:55,390
What is this? Look

6898
03:00:55,390 --> 03:00:56,410
Woah

6899
03:00:57,640 --> 03:00:58,610
Huh? But look here

6900
03:00:58,620 --> 03:00:59,630
Try to take a bite

6901
03:01:00,140 --> 03:01:02,650
There's a line, can you see it?

6902
03:01:02,650 --> 03:01:05,250
Maybe you can open it?

6903
03:01:05,250 --> 03:01:07,100
Maybe we can open it from the hair

6904
03:01:07,100 --> 03:01:08,080
Maybe

6905
03:01:08,520 --> 03:01:10,590
Let me try

6906
03:01:09,000 --> 03:01:10,050
This looks gross

6907
03:01:14,770 --> 03:01:16,990
What the-- come on

6908
03:01:15,990 --> 03:01:21,700
Please, enjoy eating its brain

6909
03:01:17,340 --> 03:01:18,990
This is so messed up

6910
03:01:18,980 --> 03:01:22,270
They brought some creepy stuff...

6911
03:01:20,450 --> 03:01:22,270
Disgusting

6912
03:01:21,010 --> 03:01:22,270
Such a poor taste

6913
03:01:23,820 --> 03:01:25,640
It's incredible

6914
03:01:24,600 --> 03:01:25,640
Horrible

6915
03:01:25,640 --> 03:01:27,510
Try to eat it

6916
03:01:26,340 --> 03:01:28,250
It takes a lot of courage

6917
03:01:27,510 --> 03:01:30,410
It takes courage, of course, what's this?

6918
03:01:31,010 --> 03:01:35,180
This kinda feels rude

6919
03:01:32,810 --> 03:01:34,810
I bet it does

6920
03:01:33,980 --> 03:01:34,810
Right?

6921
03:01:35,860 --> 03:01:36,810
It's hard

6922
03:01:37,010 --> 03:01:37,750
It's stiff

6923
03:01:37,750 --> 03:01:38,750
It's hard, isn't it?

6924
03:01:39,120 --> 03:01:42,550
Can you stop holding it by the cheekbone?

6925
03:01:40,870 --> 03:01:42,030
Like this?

6926
03:01:48,190 --> 03:01:50,430
I don't know how to hold it

6927
03:01:51,490 --> 03:01:53,800
Where should I?

6928
03:01:51,710 --> 03:01:53,800
Matsumoto pointed that out

6929
03:01:54,180 --> 03:01:56,770
I mean, holding the head...

6930
03:01:57,370 --> 03:01:59,240
I have to hold it...

6931
03:01:58,770 --> 03:02:00,350
Well, yeah, I know but...

6932
03:02:00,350 --> 03:02:01,350
Where should I...?

6933
03:02:00,350 --> 03:02:03,460
Isn't it better if you hold it from the hair?

6934
03:02:03,560 --> 03:02:04,810
Just like that, yes

6935
03:02:06,340 --> 03:02:08,610
This thing is so hard

6936
03:02:10,150 --> 03:02:11,380
It's really well made

6937
03:02:11,380 --> 03:02:11,930
Yeah

6938
03:02:11,930 --> 03:02:13,350
It's incredible

6939
03:02:14,650 --> 03:02:15,290
Taste it

6940
03:02:15,290 --> 03:02:15,970
Here I go

6941
03:02:19,890 --> 03:02:22,960
It's delicious!!

6942
03:02:21,320 --> 03:02:22,380
You're laughing

6943
03:02:26,000 --> 03:02:27,110
He just laughed

6944
03:02:27,110 --> 03:02:28,160
It's good

6945
03:02:29,650 --> 03:02:30,770
It's really good

6946
03:02:30,770 --> 03:02:35,910
Brain = strawberry ice cream

6947
03:02:32,570 --> 03:02:33,300
Strawberry?

6948
03:02:33,820 --> 03:02:34,820
Strawberry ice

6949
03:02:34,050 --> 03:02:34,820
It is

6950
03:02:34,830 --> 03:02:36,910
Yeah, but still...

6951
03:02:36,140 --> 03:02:39,440
This is incredible

6952
03:02:37,640 --> 03:02:39,760
Wow, it's really...

6953
03:02:38,340 --> 03:02:39,760
It was really good

6954
03:02:39,760 --> 03:02:41,760
It's really incredible

6955
03:02:44,700 --> 03:02:46,350
It looks like a tilted hat

6956
03:02:46,350 --> 03:02:49,550
It's slightly tilted...

6957
03:02:48,630 --> 03:02:49,720
That looks odd

6958
03:02:53,440 --> 03:02:54,970
What a surprise

6959
03:02:54,090 --> 03:02:54,970
But it's amazing

6960
03:02:54,970 --> 03:02:55,340
Yeah

6961
03:02:55,340 --> 03:02:55,830
Yes

6962
03:02:55,830 --> 03:02:56,810
It went good at least

6963
03:02:56,810 --> 03:02:59,160
Well yes, it was good

6964
03:02:57,130 --> 03:02:59,560
And we're done with your drawers

6965
03:02:59,160 --> 03:02:59,800
Let it freeze

6966
03:02:59,800 --> 03:03:01,770
Let's freeze it back

6967
03:03:01,400 --> 03:03:03,470
It's the headhunting clan's snack

6968
03:03:05,600 --> 03:03:08,570
Yama-chan, we haven't seen your drawers yet

6969
03:03:09,310 --> 03:03:11,610
You're right !!

6970
03:03:11,160 --> 03:03:11,960
He's right...

6971
03:03:12,440 --> 03:03:14,590
It took us so long

6972
03:03:14,110 --> 03:03:14,590
Yeah

6973
03:03:15,260 --> 03:03:16,280
Isn't it right?

6974
03:03:16,280 --> 03:03:16,600
Right

6975
03:03:16,600 --> 03:03:17,630
Yes

6976
03:03:16,880 --> 03:03:17,630
See?

6977
03:03:24,240 --> 03:03:25,120
Woah

6978
03:03:25,120 --> 03:03:26,970
What's this now?

6979
03:03:25,120 --> 03:03:28,030
Mysterious manuscript & key

6980
03:03:26,970 --> 03:03:28,340
This is...

6981
03:03:28,430 --> 03:03:30,560
It's the same as Hamada's

6982
03:03:29,340 --> 03:03:30,560
Again?

6983
03:03:31,360 --> 03:03:32,960
It's exactly the same

6984
03:03:32,960 --> 03:03:34,110
It's the golden thing...

6985
03:03:33,180 --> 03:03:41,240
Prove your brave spirit via the devil's mouth.
A strong golden fortune will come to dwell within you.

6986
03:03:33,180 --> 03:03:41,240
m 0 0 l 1095 0 1095 136 0 136

6987
03:03:33,980 --> 03:03:36,030
It's the same as before

6988
03:03:35,520 --> 03:03:37,830
What the hell?

6989
03:03:36,820 --> 03:03:38,000
That really stunk

6990
03:03:38,030 --> 03:03:39,620
Be careful

6991
03:03:38,620 --> 03:03:39,620
Can't help it

6992
03:03:39,800 --> 03:03:41,550
He's right, be careful

6993
03:03:40,420 --> 03:03:41,550
Be careful

6994
03:03:42,220 --> 03:03:42,840
This...

6995
03:03:54,080 --> 03:03:56,850
We don't know if it's the same for sure

6996
03:03:55,590 --> 03:03:56,850
You're right

6997
03:03:56,970 --> 03:03:58,000
But still, it's scary

6998
03:03:58,000 --> 03:03:58,570
It is

6999
03:04:00,140 --> 03:04:00,910
I'm going

7000
03:04:00,910 --> 03:04:01,260
Yes

7001
03:04:01,290 --> 03:04:01,760
Ok

7002
03:04:01,860 --> 03:04:04,130
I'm scared

7003
03:04:10,320 --> 03:04:10,770
Wha--

7004
03:04:11,430 --> 03:04:12,130
What's that?

7005
03:04:16,340 --> 03:04:17,980
Does it stink?

7006
03:04:17,670 --> 03:04:18,160
No...

7007
03:04:18,440 --> 03:04:20,780
It's sweet!

7008
03:04:21,680 --> 03:04:24,400
It doesn't even stink...

7009
03:04:22,510 --> 03:04:26,180
Hosei, let's go get changed, ok?

7010
03:04:31,620 --> 03:04:33,360
I'm going

7011
03:04:36,030 --> 03:04:37,080
I see...

7012
03:04:39,160 --> 03:04:43,170
So that was the point of it...

7013
03:04:40,980 --> 03:04:43,170
So that's the reason...

7014
03:04:43,370 --> 03:04:48,610
A change of costume for Hosei, who always causes trouble

7015
03:04:45,000 --> 03:04:48,610
Hosei, who causes trouble every year, will have to change his costume

7016
03:04:48,790 --> 03:04:54,680
What will this year's costume be?

7017
03:04:49,710 --> 03:04:52,510
Ehh? What's this?

7018
03:04:52,510 --> 03:04:54,680
Give me a break...

7019
03:04:58,620 --> 03:05:02,320
We're waiting for him to change clothes again

7020
03:05:00,020 --> 03:05:00,800
Yeah

7021
03:05:01,020 --> 03:05:02,320
Just like every year

7022
03:05:12,830 --> 03:05:14,530
That position is no good

7023
03:05:14,630 --> 03:05:17,970
Yeah, this spot is really not good

7024
03:05:16,250 --> 03:05:16,880
I know

7025
03:05:22,970 --> 03:05:25,470
Does it stick to this year's theme?

7026
03:05:27,750 --> 03:05:35,620
Tutankhamun costume

7027
03:05:38,960 --> 03:05:41,340
I wish they could stop this

7028
03:05:42,930 --> 03:05:46,060
I told them I felt bad for you and such...

7029
03:05:44,810 --> 03:05:46,060
Thanks for your concern

7030
03:05:47,000 --> 03:05:49,800
Why does it always have to be me?

7031
03:05:48,460 --> 03:05:49,030
Well

7032
03:05:50,000 --> 03:05:52,670
We don't get dirty

7033
03:05:51,370 --> 03:05:52,670
Even if you say so...

7034
03:05:53,770 --> 03:05:55,620
This is really...

7035
03:05:56,120 --> 03:05:57,620
Sorry to say

7036
03:05:58,040 --> 03:06:02,310
It's harsh on me, I'm 50 years old, you know

7037
03:05:59,490 --> 03:06:00,310
Yeah

7038
03:06:01,180 --> 03:06:02,310
That's true

7039
03:06:06,720 --> 03:06:10,390
Hosei, oh Hosei

7040
03:06:06,720 --> 03:06:10,390
Hosei, oh Hosei

7041
03:06:10,340 --> 03:06:10,890
What?

7042
03:06:10,420 --> 03:06:13,890
Art thou perhaps making fun of us?

7043
03:06:10,420 --> 03:06:13,890
Art thou perhaps making fun of us?

7044
03:06:13,270 --> 03:06:13,890
Huh?

7045
03:06:29,470 --> 03:06:34,680
Life dwells inside the idols

7046
03:06:30,390 --> 03:06:31,270
Woah, impressive

7047
03:06:31,570 --> 03:06:32,480
Eh? What's this?

7048
03:06:32,480 --> 03:06:33,830
Amazing

7049
03:06:32,480 --> 03:06:33,830
It's incredible

7050
03:06:35,440 --> 03:06:36,480
Really cool

7051
03:06:36,500 --> 03:06:38,780
We are the Apobis

7052
03:06:36,500 --> 03:06:38,780
We are the Apobis

7053
03:06:38,230 --> 03:06:39,430
They're talking

7054
03:06:38,780 --> 03:06:43,920
We've been at King Tutankhamun's service

7055
03:06:38,780 --> 03:06:43,920
We've been at king Tutankhamun's service

7056
03:06:41,720 --> 03:06:43,920
as dark shamans since ancient times

7057
03:06:41,720 --> 03:06:43,920
as dark shamans since ancient times

7058
03:06:43,970 --> 03:06:48,460
Hey, Hosei. What is scum like you doing in that outfit?

7059
03:06:43,970 --> 03:06:48,460
Hey, Hosei. What is scum like you doing in that outfit?

7060
03:06:48,510 --> 03:06:51,930
Art thou perhaps insulting our king?

7061
03:06:48,510 --> 03:06:51,930
Art thou perhaps insulting our king?

7062
03:06:51,140 --> 03:06:51,930
That's not it

7063
03:06:51,930 --> 03:06:54,770
Is this an affront to him?

7064
03:06:51,930 --> 03:06:54,770
Is this an affront to him?

7065
03:06:53,630 --> 03:06:54,770
They all spoke together

7066
03:06:55,000 --> 03:06:56,770
You're wrong

7067
03:06:56,770 --> 03:06:58,240
They arranged this for me

7068
03:06:59,390 --> 03:07:02,810
Those who ridicule our king won't be forgiven

7069
03:06:59,390 --> 03:07:02,810
Those who ridicule our king won't be forgiven

7070
03:07:02,810 --> 03:07:07,610
And for those who face our wrath,

7071
03:07:02,810 --> 03:07:07,610
And for those who face our wrath,

7072
03:07:05,210 --> 03:07:07,610
only a fate of misery awaits them

7073
03:07:05,210 --> 03:07:07,610
only a fate of misery awaits them

7074
03:07:06,960 --> 03:07:08,130
This is incredible

7075
03:07:08,130 --> 03:07:09,610
It was surprising

7076
03:07:08,440 --> 03:07:11,250
Feast thine eyes on this and realize

7077
03:07:08,440 --> 03:07:11,250
Feast thine eyes on this and realize

7078
03:07:11,800 --> 03:07:14,180
Incredible

7079
03:07:12,160 --> 03:07:14,180
It was 1949

7080
03:07:14,180 --> 03:07:18,390
John Wood III, a multimillionaire antique collector

7081
03:07:19,540 --> 03:07:28,530
Found Tutankhamun's royal treasure, protected by the Hipopo clan for generations and stole it

7082
03:07:28,760 --> 03:07:41,750
The wooden idol

7083
03:07:30,430 --> 03:07:41,750
The ancient mummy

7084
03:07:32,100 --> 03:07:41,750
The golden chalice

7085
03:07:35,120 --> 03:07:37,920
But on these three hidden treasures...

7086
03:07:37,370 --> 03:07:41,750
Curse

7087
03:07:38,070 --> 03:07:41,750
There lied a terrible curse

7088
03:07:42,330 --> 03:07:44,010
While returning

7089
03:07:44,010 --> 03:07:46,170
The seven treasure hunters

7090
03:07:46,170 --> 03:07:48,650
Led by John Wood III

7091
03:07:47,720 --> 03:07:53,240
Mysterious deaths

7092
03:07:48,900 --> 03:07:52,570
Started to die under mysterious circumstances, one after another

7093
03:07:52,570 --> 03:07:55,520
And even though John Wood III himself managed

7094
03:07:53,760 --> 03:07:59,110
Even John Wood III...

7095
03:07:55,670 --> 03:07:57,680
To bring the treasures to his mansion

7096
03:07:58,290 --> 03:07:59,630
A few days later

7097
03:07:59,630 --> 03:08:01,930
A violent storm suddenly started

7098
03:08:02,160 --> 03:08:04,600
And he was struck dead by lightning

7099
03:08:02,410 --> 03:08:06,790
Death

7100
03:08:05,520 --> 03:08:06,990
All their deaths

7101
03:08:06,990 --> 03:08:09,820
Were said to be the result of divine punishment

7102
03:08:07,350 --> 03:08:13,960
Ancient Mummy's
divine punishment

7103
03:08:10,110 --> 03:08:12,780
Brought by the ancient mummy

7104
03:08:14,330 --> 03:08:22,590
Hosei, in order to escape from mine divine punishment

7105
03:08:14,330 --> 03:08:22,590
Hosei, in order to escape from mine divine punishment

7106
03:08:15,180 --> 03:08:15,740
Yeah

7107
03:08:18,950 --> 03:08:22,590
there is only one way and that is...

7108
03:08:18,950 --> 03:08:22,590
there is only one way and that is...

7109
03:08:22,590 --> 03:08:25,860
The bonds with your friends

7110
03:08:22,590 --> 03:08:25,860
The bonds with your friends

7111
03:08:25,890 --> 03:08:31,200
We'll now proceed to ask your friends

7112
03:08:25,890 --> 03:08:31,200
We'll now proceed to ask your friends

7113
03:08:28,220 --> 03:08:31,200
some questions about you, Hosei

7114
03:08:28,220 --> 03:08:31,200
some questions about you, Hosei

7115
03:08:31,210 --> 03:08:34,230
And if they manage to answer within 10 seconds...

7116
03:08:31,210 --> 03:08:34,230
And if they manage to answer within 10 seconds...

7117
03:08:34,230 --> 03:08:40,850
Thou shall be freed from the divine ass-whacking punishment

7118
03:08:34,230 --> 03:08:40,850
Thou shall be freed from the divine ass-whacking punishment

7119
03:08:38,520 --> 03:08:39,240
Wait...

7120
03:08:39,270 --> 03:08:40,450
However...

7121
03:08:40,950 --> 03:08:42,840
If they won't be able to answer...

7122
03:08:43,190 --> 03:08:46,040
The divine punishment for Hosei shall be executed

7123
03:08:46,040 --> 03:08:51,680
Failing the quiz = punishment for Hosei

7124
03:08:46,830 --> 03:08:48,810
I'm counting on you guys

7125
03:08:48,810 --> 03:08:51,030
This is different from the other years

7126
03:08:51,030 --> 03:08:53,770
But we have no idea what they'll ask us

7127
03:08:51,510 --> 03:08:53,150
Even if you say so...

7128
03:08:53,770 --> 03:08:54,480
But maybe

7129
03:08:54,480 --> 03:08:56,350
If it's some personal stuff, then...

7130
03:08:55,380 --> 03:08:57,540
Yeah, what can we do?

7131
03:08:58,120 --> 03:09:01,190
Maybe Matsumoto is the most suited...

7132
03:09:01,190 --> 03:09:03,190
It could be, but...

7133
03:09:03,190 --> 03:09:05,300
You two know me a lot too

7134
03:09:05,300 --> 03:09:07,330
We've had tons of fun together, haven't we?

7135
03:09:06,450 --> 03:09:08,630
It's true but...

7136
03:09:06,450 --> 03:09:08,630
We'll just try our best

7137
03:09:08,630 --> 03:09:09,010
Yeah

7138
03:09:09,080 --> 03:09:09,770
Come on

7139
03:09:09,770 --> 03:09:12,640
Can you stop saying "we had fun" or such?

7140
03:09:12,640 --> 03:09:14,810
Please

7141
03:09:14,810 --> 03:09:18,370
Let's stop setting traps too, okay?

7142
03:09:17,370 --> 03:09:19,840
Isn't it obvious?

7143
03:09:18,020 --> 03:09:19,840
He's right

7144
03:09:19,840 --> 03:09:22,960
We don't want to

7145
03:09:20,360 --> 03:09:22,960
You really think we want your butt to be slapped?

7146
03:09:22,960 --> 03:09:25,820
We'll work hard to protect it

7147
03:09:24,130 --> 03:09:25,820
I'm begging you, please

7148
03:09:24,650 --> 03:09:25,300
Count on us

7149
03:09:25,300 --> 03:09:25,810
Yeah

7150
03:09:25,820 --> 03:09:27,170
For real

7151
03:09:26,630 --> 03:09:27,170
Yeah

7152
03:09:26,800 --> 03:09:27,170
Yes

7153
03:09:27,200 --> 03:09:28,080
Alright?

7154
03:09:30,220 --> 03:09:33,320
Alright then, let's ask Hamada

7155
03:09:30,220 --> 03:09:33,320
Alright then, let's ask Hamada

7156
03:09:32,270 --> 03:09:33,320
What?

7157
03:09:34,110 --> 03:09:35,460
Hosei's birthday...

7158
03:09:36,280 --> 03:09:39,280
Which month and which day is it?

7159
03:09:39,280 --> 03:09:51,370
Hosei's birthday is...?

7160
03:09:39,580 --> 03:09:41,000
You know it, don't you?

7161
03:09:41,000 --> 03:09:42,680
We know each other since 30 years

7162
03:09:42,060 --> 03:09:43,030
I'm so sorry but

7163
03:09:43,030 --> 03:09:45,370
I really have no idea

7164
03:09:44,320 --> 03:09:47,300
You're sorry? I know yours!

7165
03:09:47,300 --> 03:09:48,910
Yeah but... I don't know

7166
03:09:48,910 --> 03:09:50,170
You should know this

7167
03:09:49,570 --> 03:09:51,370
Incorrect answer

7168
03:09:49,570 --> 03:09:51,370
Incorrect answer

7169
03:09:50,210 --> 03:09:52,380
Oh come on, that's hard

7170
03:09:50,710 --> 03:09:52,380
Wait a moment! Hey!

7171
03:09:52,380 --> 03:09:54,510
He didn't say anything!!

7172
03:09:54,960 --> 03:09:57,160
I'm sorry, was it June...?

7173
03:09:57,160 --> 03:09:57,980
It's not June

7174
03:09:57,980 --> 03:09:58,910
Not even close

7175
03:09:58,910 --> 03:10:00,120
Wait a moment

7176
03:10:01,070 --> 03:10:02,120
W-wait

7177
03:10:01,270 --> 03:10:03,120
I have no idea, really

7178
03:10:03,270 --> 03:10:05,360
THAT HURT!!

7179
03:10:03,270 --> 03:10:05,360
THAT HURT!!

7180
03:10:06,420 --> 03:10:08,660
Ow ow ow ow, it hurts

7181
03:10:08,660 --> 03:10:09,380
Oh god

7182
03:10:09,380 --> 03:10:10,010
Wait

7183
03:10:17,270 --> 03:10:19,240
Please, just stop

7184
03:10:19,240 --> 03:10:22,140
Stop moving like that!

7185
03:10:22,140 --> 03:10:23,440
Stop doing that

7186
03:10:23,440 --> 03:10:26,580
That's too much

7187
03:10:23,440 --> 03:10:26,580
You can't do that

7188
03:10:26,580 --> 03:10:28,650
Please, stop moving like that

7189
03:10:27,680 --> 03:10:30,200
I swear I'll stop, I'll stop

7190
03:10:28,650 --> 03:10:30,200
I get that hurt just now

7191
03:10:30,200 --> 03:10:31,550
Here's the answer

7192
03:10:31,730 --> 03:10:35,150
ANSWER: FEBRUARY 15TH

7193
03:10:31,730 --> 03:10:35,150
ANSWER: FEBRUARY 15TH

7194
03:10:32,990 --> 03:10:35,150
It was that

7195
03:10:32,990 --> 03:10:35,150
Man, I really didn't know

7196
03:10:35,690 --> 03:10:37,650
Hamada-san, yours is on the 11th of May!

7197
03:10:36,890 --> 03:10:37,650
Yes, thank you---

7198
03:10:37,650 --> 03:10:39,320
"Thank you" my ass!

7199
03:10:38,730 --> 03:10:39,870
You're right

7200
03:10:38,730 --> 03:10:39,870
You're right

7201
03:10:39,320 --> 03:10:41,990
That's completely wrong!

7202
03:10:40,190 --> 03:10:41,160
We're sorry, we're sorry

7203
03:10:40,190 --> 03:10:41,160
We're sorry, we're sorry

7204
03:10:41,160 --> 03:10:42,690
But please, let's just

7205
03:10:42,690 --> 03:10:44,160
Try to get along

7206
03:10:43,660 --> 03:10:45,200
Wait a sec--

7207
03:10:44,160 --> 03:10:46,560
Let's get along

7208
03:10:45,980 --> 03:10:46,560
Alright

7209
03:10:46,560 --> 03:10:48,400
Something like this

7210
03:10:48,400 --> 03:10:49,730
Is what we don't want to happen right now

7211
03:10:49,730 --> 03:10:51,970
Is what we don't want to happen right now

7212
03:10:50,720 --> 03:10:51,970
Yes, we gotta keep our bond

7213
03:10:52,300 --> 03:10:54,100
Also, that comical way of moving is no good

7214
03:10:54,100 --> 03:10:55,840
Also, that comical way of moving is no good

7215
03:10:55,840 --> 03:10:57,610
I'm not trying to be comical

7216
03:10:57,610 --> 03:10:59,340
I've said this before

7217
03:10:59,340 --> 03:11:00,810
"My ass is done for" - I said it, didn't I?

7218
03:11:00,810 --> 03:11:03,150
"My ass is done for" - I said it, didn't I?

7219
03:11:03,150 --> 03:11:04,080
I said it, didn't I?

7220
03:11:04,080 --> 03:11:06,080
I said it, didn't I?

7221
03:11:09,840 --> 03:11:11,840
What was that for?

7222
03:11:12,660 --> 03:11:14,410
What is he talking about?

7223
03:11:12,990 --> 03:11:15,920
Alright, we got it

7224
03:11:13,790 --> 03:11:15,920
Wait, wait---

7225
03:11:15,920 --> 03:11:17,030
Please wait

7226
03:11:18,260 --> 03:11:20,650
That's too much

7227
03:11:20,650 --> 03:11:21,600
That guy hits hard

7228
03:11:21,650 --> 03:11:25,140
It friggin' hurts

7229
03:11:22,670 --> 03:11:23,630
Even just now he...

7230
03:11:23,630 --> 03:11:25,130
This can't be good

7231
03:11:25,140 --> 03:11:27,800
It only took one hit to become like this

7232
03:11:26,590 --> 03:11:28,970
It looks bad

7233
03:11:27,800 --> 03:11:28,970
For real

7234
03:11:29,170 --> 03:11:32,640
I really thought it came off

7235
03:11:32,640 --> 03:11:34,640
Alright but really

7236
03:11:34,640 --> 03:11:37,100
I don't think it will come off, ok?

7237
03:11:37,100 --> 03:11:38,420
Hang in there

7238
03:11:37,480 --> 03:11:40,880
I'm sorry for that

7239
03:11:41,230 --> 03:11:45,320
NOW, LET'S ASK MATSUMOTO

7240
03:11:41,230 --> 03:11:45,320
NOW, LET'S ASK MATSUMOTO

7241
03:11:43,990 --> 03:11:44,400
Yessir

7242
03:11:44,400 --> 03:11:45,320
Please, wait...

7243
03:11:45,320 --> 03:11:47,360
Which university did Hosei attend?

7244
03:11:47,360 --> 03:11:50,060
Which university did Hosei attend?

7245
03:11:50,060 --> 03:11:51,290
That one, yes?

7246
03:11:50,080 --> 03:12:03,540
Q. Which university did Hosei attend?

7247
03:11:50,080 --> 03:12:03,540
m 0 0 l 0 -72 l 1293 -72 l 1293 0

7248
03:11:51,290 --> 03:11:53,130
You know I went there

7249
03:11:52,180 --> 03:11:53,830
I have no idea

7250
03:11:53,130 --> 03:11:56,780
Remember I told you when I was 30 I decided to study again?

7251
03:11:56,780 --> 03:11:58,000
So... Ok?

7252
03:11:58,570 --> 03:12:00,170
I have no idea!!

7253
03:12:00,370 --> 03:12:02,370
INCORRECT

7254
03:12:00,370 --> 03:12:03,530
INCORRECT

7255
03:12:05,270 --> 03:12:08,080
How am I supposed to know that?

7256
03:12:05,270 --> 03:12:08,080
I really don't know

7257
03:12:05,270 --> 03:12:08,080
Yeah, me neither

7258
03:12:08,080 --> 03:12:09,950
I didn't know that

7259
03:12:08,640 --> 03:12:09,950
What's this?

7260
03:12:09,950 --> 03:12:11,580
I wonder which one is it

7261
03:12:09,950 --> 03:12:11,580
Please...

7262
03:12:12,550 --> 03:12:14,650
AAAAH!

7263
03:12:19,820 --> 03:12:20,440
Stop--

7264
03:12:20,440 --> 03:12:21,610
Stop that, please

7265
03:12:22,620 --> 03:12:25,150
We said enough of that

7266
03:12:23,740 --> 03:12:27,580
Those moves...

7267
03:12:24,430 --> 03:12:27,580
Stop moving like that

7268
03:12:25,150 --> 03:12:26,650
Didn't we?

7269
03:12:26,650 --> 03:12:27,580
Alright?

7270
03:12:27,580 --> 03:12:30,030
Please stop moving like that, Hosei

7271
03:12:28,780 --> 03:12:30,030
That's the issue here

7272
03:12:30,030 --> 03:12:32,990
Come on

7273
03:12:30,030 --> 03:12:32,990
What the hell?

7274
03:12:30,030 --> 03:12:32,990
You're overdoing it, geez

7275
03:12:32,990 --> 03:12:33,900
Just try to hold it

7276
03:12:33,900 --> 03:12:37,210
We have to do something about this...

7277
03:12:35,040 --> 03:12:37,040
I know it's painful, but that...

7278
03:12:35,040 --> 03:12:37,210
I think he knows it

7279
03:12:37,210 --> 03:12:38,420
But...

7280
03:12:38,420 --> 03:12:40,160
That looks bad

7281
03:12:39,320 --> 03:12:40,160
I think that

7282
03:12:40,160 --> 03:12:41,510
We could have figured it out

7283
03:12:41,510 --> 03:12:43,610
I have no idea

7284
03:12:41,510 --> 03:12:43,610
I think I know the answer

7285
03:12:41,510 --> 03:12:43,610
Which is it?

7286
03:12:43,610 --> 03:12:44,850
It's just like your name, isn't it?

7287
03:12:44,850 --> 03:12:46,680
Just like my name?

7288
03:12:45,630 --> 03:12:46,680
What do you mean?

7289
03:12:46,330 --> 03:12:46,680
What?

7290
03:12:46,680 --> 03:12:48,050
Hosei University, right?

7291
03:12:48,050 --> 03:12:49,290
I couldn't get into that school!

7292
03:12:49,690 --> 03:12:51,530
The correct answer is...

7293
03:12:51,530 --> 03:12:52,720
Rissho University

7294
03:12:52,720 --> 03:12:54,690
I had no idea

7295
03:12:52,920 --> 03:12:57,690
ANSWER: RISSHO UNIVERSITY

7296
03:12:52,920 --> 03:12:57,690
ANSWER: RISSHO UNIVERSITY

7297
03:12:53,820 --> 03:12:55,970
Ahh, now that they said it...

7298
03:12:54,690 --> 03:12:59,630
I mean I know there is Hosei University, but I also knew it was wrong

7299
03:12:57,690 --> 03:12:59,630
Now I remember

7300
03:12:59,630 --> 03:13:01,040
We have to do something

7301
03:13:01,040 --> 03:13:03,160
This is really bad

7302
03:13:01,880 --> 03:13:04,100
It was kinda impossible for us

7303
03:13:03,150 --> 03:13:04,100
I'm done for

7304
03:13:04,100 --> 03:13:05,540
Use that to cool him down

7305
03:13:04,470 --> 03:13:05,750
Ah! You're right! Right, right, right!

7306
03:13:05,750 --> 03:13:06,700
Ah! You're right! Right, right, right!

7307
03:13:06,700 --> 03:13:08,490
We have the right stuff here

7308
03:13:07,450 --> 03:13:08,490
What--?

7309
03:13:09,410 --> 03:13:11,980
Here's the good stuff

7310
03:13:10,010 --> 03:13:11,010
No way

7311
03:13:10,810 --> 03:13:12,960
What's with "good stuff"?

7312
03:13:11,010 --> 03:13:11,980
Ah, that?

7313
03:13:11,980 --> 03:13:14,340
I mean, this is an emergency

7314
03:13:13,140 --> 03:13:14,340
Here

7315
03:13:14,340 --> 03:13:15,380
Woah

7316
03:13:16,450 --> 03:13:17,610
Are you using that?

7317
03:13:17,610 --> 03:13:19,610
This will cool him down

7318
03:13:19,610 --> 03:13:20,720
Yeah but... that?

7319
03:13:24,990 --> 03:13:26,390
Is it working?

7320
03:13:26,860 --> 03:13:29,130
It's cold, but...

7321
03:13:29,360 --> 03:13:31,490
No way, wait...

7322
03:13:30,380 --> 03:13:31,490
I think that...

7323
03:13:32,150 --> 03:13:34,190
Maybe it's better like this

7324
03:13:32,390 --> 03:13:34,190
Yeah, definitely

7325
03:13:41,150 --> 03:13:42,840
No way, come on

7326
03:13:42,840 --> 03:13:44,530
You gotta be kidding me

7327
03:13:43,310 --> 03:13:44,530
We had to do this

7328
03:13:44,920 --> 03:13:46,390
We have to cool him down

7329
03:13:48,740 --> 03:13:49,550
But really

7330
03:13:49,550 --> 03:13:51,880
This is really effective, I think

7331
03:13:50,460 --> 03:13:52,130
I think so too

7332
03:13:52,130 --> 03:13:53,970
It will quickly cool him down

7333
03:13:52,970 --> 03:13:54,480
Yeah, it feels better now

7334
03:13:53,970 --> 03:13:54,480
See?

7335
03:13:56,220 --> 03:14:00,790
Now, let's ask Endo

7336
03:13:56,220 --> 03:14:00,790
Now, let's ask Endo

7337
03:13:56,670 --> 03:13:58,330
Now it's Tanaka, right?

7338
03:13:58,330 --> 03:13:59,620
Oh, I'll give my best

7339
03:13:59,620 --> 03:14:00,170
Go for it

7340
03:14:00,170 --> 03:14:03,110
I'm counting on you

7341
03:14:01,210 --> 03:14:03,110

7342
03:14:01,490 --> 03:14:03,110
Yes

7343
03:14:03,110 --> 03:14:07,000

7344
03:14:07,000 --> 03:14:08,230
Eh? Which is it?

7345
03:14:07,180 --> 03:14:20,040
Q. What lessons did Hosei take during his childhood?

7346
03:14:07,180 --> 03:14:20,040

7347
03:14:08,230 --> 03:14:08,930
It's something I learnt, come on, I'm always saying it

7348
03:14:08,930 --> 03:14:09,600
It's something I learnt, come on, I'm always saying it

7349
03:14:09,600 --> 03:14:11,100
It's something I learnt, come on, I'm always saying it

7350
03:14:11,100 --> 03:14:13,500
"I'm good at this"  - I always say that!

7351
03:14:11,820 --> 03:14:12,370
Ah! T-then I'll go for it...

7352
03:14:12,370 --> 03:14:14,120
Ah! T-then I'll go for it...

7353
03:14:13,740 --> 03:14:14,250
You can do it! Come on, say it!

7354

It's...

7355

You can do it! Come on, say it!

7356
03:14:16,210 --> 03:14:17,570
Kendo

7357
03:14:16,210 --> 03:14:20,040
T/N: Kendo is a swords martial arts that requires wearing armor and using wooden swords or bamboo swords for practice. There are a few Gaki no Tsukai episodes where Hosei shows off his kendo skills.

7358
03:14:16,870 --> 03:14:18,270
Alright!

7359
03:14:17,570 --> 03:14:20,040
INCORRECT

7360
03:14:17,570 --> 03:14:20,040

7361
03:14:18,270 --> 03:14:19,420
What?!

7362
03:14:22,440 --> 03:14:23,110
Huh?

7363
03:14:23,110 --> 03:14:24,310
Huh? Why?

7364
03:14:23,780 --> 03:14:25,480
Wasn't it kendo?

7365
03:14:24,310 --> 03:14:25,480
Wait a sec...

7366
03:14:25,480 --> 03:14:26,920
But it's kendo

7367
03:14:26,370 --> 03:14:28,230
Yeah, it's kendo

7368
03:14:26,920 --> 03:14:28,680
It's kendo

7369
03:14:28,680 --> 03:14:29,950
It's kendo!!

7370
03:14:30,600 --> 03:14:31,990
IT HURTS!!

7371
03:14:32,890 --> 03:14:34,890
But...

7372
03:14:38,610 --> 03:14:39,600
Wait, wait, wait

7373
03:14:39,600 --> 03:14:39,910

What the hell

7377
03:14:42,570 --> 03:14:45,070
Why did they walk together?

7378
03:14:45,070 --> 03:14:47,130
Gimme a break!

7379
03:14:48,800 --> 03:14:49,940
What the hell, man

7380
03:14:49,940 --> 03:14:50,790
Come on

Give us a break

7382
03:14:51,120 --> 03:14:52,010
Wait a second

7383
03:14:52,010 --> 03:14:55,380
What was that just now?

7384
03:14:53,430 --> 03:14:54,500
Are you alright?

7385
03:14:54,500 --> 03:14:55,380

7386
03:14:55,790 --> 03:14:57,410
Wait a moment...

7387
03:14:56,560 --> 03:14:57,410
Was it wrong?

7388
03:14:58,010 --> 03:14:59,820
The answer was "painting lessons"

7389
03:14:59,820 --> 03:15:01,220

ANSWER: PAINTING LESSONS

7392
03:15:01,980 --> 03:15:04,150
I mean, I went there

7393
03:15:04,150 --> 03:15:06,590
But for just two months

7394
03:15:05,440 --> 03:15:07,110
Well, I guess that's it...

7395
03:15:06,590 --> 03:15:09,730
It was just for two months

7396
03:15:07,110 --> 03:15:09,730
How could we guess it?

7397
03:15:07,820 --> 03:15:09,730
I mean, you said it yourself

7398
03:15:09,730 --> 03:15:11,760
But I did kendo for 13 years

7399
03:15:11,760 --> 03:15:14,830
While I had painting lessons for just two months

7400
03:15:13,810 --> 03:15:15,430
Alright, alright...

7401
03:15:14,830 --> 03:15:17,300
Wait, guardian deities...

7402

Enough, just forgive them

7403

I know this is so sudden, but from now on

7408
03:15:25,940 --> 03:15:29,250
Can all the four of them answer together?

7409

7415
03:15:38,850 --> 03:15:39,690
What?

7416
03:15:39,690 --> 03:15:40,600

We broke him

7564
03:16:17,360 --> 03:16:18,860
Man we did it

7565
03:16:17,820 --> 03:16:20,220
He's broken

7566
03:16:18,860 --> 03:16:20,220
We finally broke him

7567
03:16:21,930 --> 03:16:22,700
Hosei's broken

7568
03:16:22,700 --> 03:16:25,840
I had no idea, man

7569
03:16:22,880 --> 03:16:27,540
CORRECT ANSWER: AiAi

7570
03:16:22,880 --> 03:16:27,540
CORRECT ANSWER: AiAi

7571
03:16:23,600 --> 03:16:25,840
Cool him down, quick

7572
03:16:27,620 --> 03:16:28,940
Look

7573
03:16:27,620 --> 03:16:30,340
Now that they said it I remember

7574
03:16:28,940 --> 03:16:30,340
This isn't good

7575
03:16:30,470 --> 03:16:32,720
Let's put it here

7576
03:16:31,070 --> 03:16:32,720
Spread it

7577
03:16:33,180 --> 03:16:34,980
This is messed up...

7578
03:16:35,780 --> 03:16:36,800
Like this

7579
03:16:39,620 --> 03:16:41,480
What the hell are you doing?

7580
03:16:41,480 --> 03:16:43,350
How is this?

7581
03:16:42,420 --> 03:16:43,350
No way

7582
03:16:43,350 --> 03:16:44,390
Doesn't it feel good?

7583
03:16:44,390 --> 03:16:46,590
Does it hit the spot?

7584
03:16:46,590 --> 03:16:47,780
He's looking here

7585
03:16:47,770 --> 03:16:48,920
I really don't know

7586
03:16:47,770 --> 03:16:48,920
Looks good

7587
03:16:49,260 --> 03:16:53,300
It feels like Hamada is protecting you

7588
03:16:49,580 --> 03:16:50,610
Thanks

7589
03:16:50,610 --> 03:16:52,400
No way it feels like that

7590
03:16:52,400 --> 03:16:53,560
Yeah, I think it's good

7591
03:16:53,560 --> 03:16:56,100
Are there still questions left?

7592
03:16:55,300 --> 03:16:56,100
I swear

7593
03:16:56,100 --> 03:16:58,100
Can't they just forgive us?

7594
03:16:57,080 --> 03:16:58,780
Yeah, isn't that enough?

7595
03:16:58,100 --> 03:16:59,810
For real...

7596
03:16:58,780 --> 03:16:59,800
Enough of that

7597
03:16:59,380 --> 03:17:03,870
Alright, our next one will be our final question

7598
03:16:59,380 --> 03:17:03,870
Alright, our next one will be our final question

7599
03:17:02,820 --> 03:17:04,820
That's the last one

7600
03:17:03,920 --> 03:17:06,040
Let's ask Matsumoto

7601
03:17:03,920 --> 03:17:06,040
Let's ask Matsumoto

7602
03:17:05,390 --> 03:17:06,040
Yes?

7603
03:17:06,040 --> 03:17:07,780
Who was

7604
03:17:07,780 --> 03:17:14,620
T/N: "Tensai TV-kun" was a TV show aimed towards elementary and middle school children that adults could also enjoy.

7605
03:17:07,780 --> 03:17:14,620
The co-host lady for Hosei's TV show "Tensai TV-kun"?

7606
03:17:14,620 --> 03:17:26,460
Q. Who was the co-host lady for Hosei's tv show "Tensai TV-kun"?

7607
03:17:14,620 --> 03:17:26,460
m 0 0 l 0 -72 l 1293 -72 l 1293 0

7608
03:17:16,540 --> 03:17:17,950
A lady?

7609
03:17:18,560 --> 03:17:22,060
I have no clue

7610
03:17:19,990 --> 03:17:20,520
Here's a big hint "Risa something"

7611
03:17:20,520 --> 03:17:23,060
Here's a big hint "Risa something"

7612
03:17:23,060 --> 03:17:24,860
Risa Stickmayer!

7613
03:17:23,930 --> 03:17:26,460
INCORRECT

7614
03:17:23,930 --> 03:17:26,460
INCORRECT

7615
03:17:25,460 --> 03:17:26,460
Eh?

7616
03:17:29,950 --> 03:17:30,980
It was correct

7617
03:17:31,820 --> 03:17:32,870
Was he too late?

7618
03:17:32,870 --> 03:17:34,980
You'll be fine, don't worry

7619
03:17:34,970 --> 03:17:37,410
Hamada will protect you

7620
03:17:34,980 --> 03:17:35,990
Don't worry

7621
03:17:43,410 --> 03:17:45,410
It opened up at the end

7622
03:17:43,980 --> 03:17:46,120
Something came out

7623
03:17:44,850 --> 03:17:46,120
Oh, you're right

7624
03:17:46,480 --> 03:17:49,520
Looks like tinfoil came out from Hamada's head

7625
03:17:49,520 --> 03:17:51,520
So many things are happening...

7626
03:17:59,960 --> 03:18:02,770
Wasn't that the correct answer?

7627
03:18:01,700 --> 03:18:02,760
Yeah it was

7628
03:18:02,760 --> 03:18:06,940
The correct answer was "Risa Stegmayer"

7629
03:18:07,120 --> 03:18:11,780
ANSWER RISA STEGMAYER

7630
03:18:07,120 --> 03:18:11,780
ANSWER RISA STEGMAYER

7631
03:18:07,520 --> 03:18:09,540
Ah, I said "Risa Stick-"...

7632
03:18:09,540 --> 03:18:11,780
"Steg"

7633
03:18:09,540 --> 03:18:11,780
I see, it was "Steg"...

7634
03:18:11,770 --> 03:18:14,910
That was so unfair

7635
03:18:13,560 --> 03:18:15,180
"Risa Stegmayer"...

7636
03:18:14,930 --> 03:18:19,480
BURN IN HELL!!

7637
03:18:14,930 --> 03:18:19,480
BURN IN HELL!!

7638
03:18:19,480 --> 03:18:21,820
What do they mean?

7639
03:18:22,450 --> 03:18:23,120
Eh? Scary, they said "burn in hell"...

7640
03:18:23,120 --> 03:18:26,020
Eh? Scary, they said "burn in hell"...

7641
03:18:24,250 --> 03:18:26,560
That was impressive

7642
03:18:25,370 --> 03:18:27,690
Yeah, it was

7643
03:18:26,520 --> 03:18:27,690
It's over now, isn't it?

7644
03:18:26,560 --> 03:18:28,340
Yes

7645
03:18:27,690 --> 03:18:28,340
Yes

7646
03:18:29,240 --> 03:18:30,760
That surprised me

7647
03:18:30,760 --> 03:18:33,700
What a terrible time we had

7648
03:18:37,000 --> 03:18:41,440
We tried our best, but the questions were too difficult...

7649
03:18:40,250 --> 03:18:41,440
That's true

7650
03:18:41,440 --> 03:18:42,700
We couldn't get them right

7651
03:18:44,470 --> 03:18:48,110
Hosei let's go get changed

7652
03:18:47,440 --> 03:18:49,440
So quick!

7653
03:18:48,110 --> 03:18:50,150
Hosei let's go get changed

7654
03:18:50,710 --> 03:18:54,680
He left the room so quickly!

7655
03:18:56,640 --> 03:19:01,190
It's 5 P.M. and they're waiting for Hosei to get back

7656
03:18:56,970 --> 03:19:01,190
9 HOURS SINCE THE START

7657
03:19:03,410 --> 03:19:05,030
Oh, welcome back

7658
03:19:05,030 --> 03:19:07,360
Much appreciated

7659
03:19:07,630 --> 03:19:09,460
That was insane

7660
03:19:09,530 --> 03:19:12,500
It really hurt like crazy

7661
03:19:11,350 --> 03:19:12,780
I bet it did

7662
03:19:12,770 --> 03:19:15,070
Man, today's been harsh...

7663
03:19:16,300 --> 03:19:17,610
Thanks for the cushion

7664
03:19:17,610 --> 03:19:19,510
Thanks for the cushion

7665
03:19:21,840 --> 03:19:23,880
That must hurt a lot

7666
03:19:23,880 --> 03:19:25,680
We didn't know as much as we thought

7667
03:19:25,680 --> 03:19:26,550
You really don't know anything

7668
03:19:26,550 --> 03:19:28,790
You really don't know anything

7669
03:19:29,150 --> 03:19:32,800
There were like 2 questions for each of us, that's 8 hits...

7670
03:19:32,800 --> 03:19:35,860
I guess 10 hits would have been way too much

7671
03:19:33,680 --> 03:19:35,240
Yes, no way

7672
03:19:35,240 --> 03:19:37,240
That was absurd

7673
03:19:38,800 --> 03:19:40,560
Huh?

7674
03:19:40,560 --> 03:19:43,830
Are you sure your ass really hurts?

7675
03:19:42,380 --> 03:19:45,280
It really hurts

7676
03:19:44,030 --> 03:19:46,640
You seem too normal to me!!

7677
03:19:45,270 --> 03:19:46,640
I'm not normal

7678
03:19:46,640 --> 03:19:47,670
It's been burning this whole time

7679
03:19:47,670 --> 03:19:49,810
It's been burning this whole time

7680
03:19:50,110 --> 03:19:51,510
I'm shocked to be honest, you don't know anything about me

7681
03:19:51,510 --> 03:19:53,610
I'm shocked to be honest, you don't know anything about me

7682
03:19:53,610 --> 03:19:58,850
Unsatisfied by the quiz's results

7683
03:19:54,010 --> 03:19:56,110
I know a lot about you

7684
03:19:56,110 --> 03:19:58,850
What's my blood type?

7685
03:19:58,850 --> 03:20:00,050
Let's see...

7686
03:20:00,050 --> 03:20:00,950
It's A

7687
03:20:01,180 --> 03:20:03,390
It's O

7688
03:20:05,290 --> 03:20:07,790
I mean, blood types...?

7689
03:20:08,930 --> 03:20:13,380
If we did all four at once

7690
03:20:09,010 --> 03:20:12,760
If only the four of us could have answered together...

7691
03:20:13,540 --> 03:20:16,630
We could avoid a lot of this

7692
03:20:15,250 --> 03:20:16,630
That's right

7693
03:20:16,010 --> 03:20:19,330
Right, that's we should've done, probably

7694

But then you changed it to O

7699
03:20:28,050 --> 03:20:29,210

Just now, Endo was shocked!!

7715
03:20:58,700 --> 03:21:01,240

7716
03:21:01,240 --> 03:21:03,480

03:25:23,990 --> 03:25:26,340
What the hell?

7875
03:25:30,580 --> 03:25:31,150
You guys aren't Dachou Club

7876
03:25:31,150 --> 03:25:32,650
You guys aren't Dachou Club

7877
03:25:32,650 --> 03:25:34,720
TAKE THEM AWAY!!

7878
03:25:33,640 --> 03:25:34,720
Yes sir!

7879
03:25:34,530 --> 03:25:35,350
What?!

7880
03:25:35,350 --> 03:25:37,440
We're Dachou Club!

7881
03:25:35,350 --> 03:25:39,220
Case Note

7882
03:25:35,350 --> 03:25:39,220
Verified as fakes,
they are forced out of the room

7883
03:25:37,440 --> 03:25:41,060
WE'RE DACHOU CLUB!

7884
03:25:39,220 --> 03:25:43,490
I didn't think they were

7885
03:25:40,780 --> 03:25:43,490
Yeah, they're definitely fake

7886
03:25:43,690 --> 03:25:44,830
Okay! Let's get back to the investigation

7887
03:25:44,830 --> 03:25:46,330
Okay! Let's get back to the investigation

7888
03:25:46,110 --> 03:25:51,000
Yes sir!

7889
03:25:46,330 --> 03:25:51,000
Continuing the investigation in his underwear

7890
03:25:48,680 --> 03:25:50,530
Why just underwear?

7891
03:25:51,000 --> 03:25:53,800
They dropped this whip-like thing

7892
03:25:53,800 --> 03:25:57,010
Case Note

7893
03:25:53,800 --> 03:25:57,010
Lost Leather Whip

7894
03:25:57,320 --> 03:26:03,150
SM is my favorite hobby, so

7895
03:25:57,320 --> 03:26:03,150
T/N: "SM" refers to sadomasochism.

7896
03:26:00,040 --> 03:26:03,150
I'm bursting  with excitement!

7897
03:26:01,510 --> 03:26:03,150
I'm bursting with excitement!

7898
03:26:03,150 --> 03:26:09,590
Inspector Takashima's pervert switch flipped

7899
03:26:06,960 --> 03:26:09,590
Hey you - I like the way you're looking at me

7900
03:26:07,870 --> 03:26:09,590
Yeah

7901
03:26:10,150 --> 03:26:12,920
Please hit me with this

7902
03:26:11,710 --> 03:26:12,920
No, I'm okay

7903
03:26:12,920 --> 03:26:14,820
Please hit me with this

7904
03:26:14,000 --> 03:26:14,820
I'm okay

7905
03:26:16,340 --> 03:26:17,160
So, I uh...

7906
03:26:18,020 --> 03:26:19,590
Wait, Takashima

7907
03:26:18,660 --> 03:26:20,400
It won't hurt at all, so hit me

7908
03:26:20,400 --> 03:26:23,000
It won't hurt at all, so hit me

7909
03:26:21,020 --> 03:26:23,000
No way

7910
03:26:22,600 --> 03:26:23,970
Seriously?

7911
03:26:23,970 --> 03:26:25,770
Hit me harder

7912
03:26:25,770 --> 03:26:26,840
More!

7913
03:26:27,250 --> 03:26:29,200
I can't feel it, so hit harder!

7914
03:26:29,490 --> 03:26:34,010
Harder! Hit me for real! Harder! Good!

7915
03:26:34,010 --> 03:26:35,990
Tear my ass up until I pass out!

7916
03:26:35,440 --> 03:26:37,550
Tear my ass up until I pass out!

7917
03:26:37,550 --> 03:26:39,720
HIT ME HARDER!!

7918
03:26:40,800 --> 03:26:43,550
What was he saying?

7919
03:26:42,180 --> 03:26:43,550
He's perverted, seriously!

7920
03:26:43,060 --> 03:26:45,550
He's crazy!

7921
03:26:44,470 --> 03:26:45,550
Masahiro!

7922
03:26:46,090 --> 03:26:47,090
It's the night of New Year's Eve, what are you doing?

7923
03:26:47,090 --> 03:26:48,620
It's the night of New Year's Eve, what are you doing?

7924
03:26:51,510 --> 03:26:54,360
Really, what are you saying?

7925
03:26:57,400 --> 03:26:57,570
Scary

7926
03:26:57,570 --> 03:26:57,730
Scary

7927
03:26:57,730 --> 03:26:59,940
Scary

7928
03:26:59,940 --> 03:27:01,400
What kind of training did you do

7929
03:27:01,400 --> 03:27:06,980
What kind of training did you do to get those eyes?

7930
03:27:02,570 --> 03:27:06,980
You are totally a super masochist, right?

7931
03:27:07,360 --> 03:27:09,530
Uh... Is that so...

7932
03:27:09,560 --> 03:27:11,140
That is...

7933
03:27:13,890 --> 03:27:15,840
That's...

7934
03:27:15,840 --> 03:27:19,290
Anyway,

7935
03:27:16,390 --> 03:27:19,290
who is the culprit!!

7936
03:27:19,290 --> 03:27:20,490
Inspector Takashima

7937
03:27:20,790 --> 03:27:23,590
What is that stuck to your underwear?

7938
03:27:24,490 --> 03:27:27,530
That's the decoration from

7939
03:27:26,300 --> 03:27:27,530
the golden collar, isn't it?!!

7940
03:27:27,530 --> 03:27:33,340
A red feather only the culprit would have

7941
03:27:27,530 --> 03:27:33,340
Case Note

7942
03:27:27,850 --> 03:27:30,530
I don't know! Someone must have stuck it to me!

7943
03:27:30,640 --> 03:27:35,040
Come to think of it, when the crime occurred, you had left to buy cigarettes!

7944
03:27:35,040 --> 03:27:37,040
It's a coincidence that I left!

7945
03:27:37,040 --> 03:27:39,840
I've never seen someone run out of smokes with such precision!

7946
03:27:39,870 --> 03:27:41,840
You're the culprit!

7947
03:27:40,640 --> 03:27:43,840
You ungrateful little!

7948
03:27:43,500 --> 03:27:46,080
You fools! Get him out of here!

7949
03:27:44,150 --> 03:27:49,020
Case Note

7950
03:27:44,150 --> 03:27:49,020
The real culprit was Inspector Takashima

7951
03:27:46,840 --> 03:27:49,020
That's a great ending

7952
03:27:49,020 --> 03:27:50,420
I have a reputation to protect!!

7953
03:27:50,420 --> 03:27:52,960
What are you saying dressed like that!!

7954
03:27:51,980 --> 03:27:52,960
Shut up idiot!

7955
03:27:52,960 --> 03:27:55,360
No one could respect you, in your underwear!

7956
03:27:55,360 --> 03:27:57,890
This back and forth

7957
03:27:55,690 --> 03:28:01,960
Case Note

7958
03:27:55,690 --> 03:28:01,960
The case is closed with this ending

7959
03:27:57,160 --> 03:27:59,160
I know

7960
03:28:06,270 --> 03:28:09,810
A group of Happy Boys takes the stage

7961
03:28:07,600 --> 03:28:09,800
EVERYBODY COME ON

7962
03:28:10,310 --> 03:28:11,640
WOW!!

7963
03:28:11,660 --> 03:28:13,940
Thank You

7964
03:28:12,720 --> 03:28:13,940
ThankYou

7965
03:28:13,960 --> 03:28:16,880
WELCOME TO HAPPY BOY! We're here!

7966
03:28:16,900 --> 03:28:18,980
Kameda Family

7967
03:28:19,000 --> 03:28:21,380
Takashima Family

7968
03:28:21,380 --> 03:28:23,620
Okada Family

7969
03:28:23,640 --> 03:28:24,450
Where art thou?

7970
03:28:24,550 --> 03:28:24,750
Hey          Hey

7971
03:28:24,750 --> 03:28:26,920
Hey          Hey

7972
03:28:28,980 --> 03:28:31,830
Doko ni itta? Where'd you go? Where'd you go?

7973
03:28:34,280 --> 03:28:36,930
This self deprecation is impressive

7974
03:28:35,500 --> 03:28:38,270
I'm not a Happy Boy now, I'm a Lonely Boy

7975
03:28:38,630 --> 03:28:39,240
All alone

7976
03:28:39,500 --> 03:28:40,020
Stupid          Stupid          Stupid

7977
03:28:40,020 --> 03:28:40,320
Stupid          Stupid          Stupid

7978
03:28:40,320 --> 03:28:41,000
Stupid          Stupid          Stupid

7979
03:28:41,000 --> 03:28:42,240
That aside

7980
03:28:42,570 --> 03:28:45,740
Takashima!! That's a great nude look!!

7981
03:28:46,010 --> 03:28:47,540
Excellent!!Come on!

7982
03:28:46,860 --> 03:28:47,540
Excellent!! Come on!

7983
03:28:47,890 --> 03:28:50,450
On New Year's Eve crawling on all fours

7984
03:28:50,280 --> 03:28:50,450
YAY

7985
03:28:50,450 --> 03:28:51,180
Takashima Family's disgrace

7986
03:28:51,180 --> 03:28:51,880
Takashima Family's disgrace

7987
03:28:51,880 --> 03:28:53,050
Takashima Family's disgrace

7988
03:28:53,050 --> 03:28:53,750
Even for my comedy training, I

7989
03:28:53,750 --> 03:28:54,450
Even for my comedy training, I

7990
03:28:54,450 --> 03:28:55,280
Even for my comedy training, I

7991
03:28:55,620 --> 03:28:55,950
Spank Spank Spank

7992
03:28:55,950 --> 03:28:56,320
Spank Spank Spank

7993
03:28:56,320 --> 03:28:58,490
Spank Spank Spank

7994
03:28:56,720 --> 03:28:58,490
Is this the time for that?!!

7995
03:28:58,490 --> 03:28:59,440
Moron!! Come on!

7996
03:28:59,440 --> 03:28:59,790
Moron!! Come on!

7997
03:28:59,820 --> 03:29:01,960
HAPPY BOY

7998
03:29:02,040 --> 03:29:03,130
WOW!!

7999
03:29:07,170 --> 03:29:08,360
What the hell is this?

8000
03:29:08,360 --> 03:29:11,850
Comedy training spank spank spank

8001
03:29:10,970 --> 03:29:13,340
It's good that he enjoys it so much!!

8002
03:29:14,940 --> 03:29:16,340
EVERYBODY

8003
03:29:16,370 --> 03:29:18,310
HAPPY BOY

8004
03:29:18,370 --> 03:29:19,610
WOW!!

8005
03:29:21,830 --> 03:29:23,310
Why?

8006
03:29:26,500 --> 03:29:28,780
I got it

8007
03:29:26,650 --> 03:29:28,780
Watching me bomb

8008
03:29:28,880 --> 03:29:29,100
Hey Hey

8009
03:29:29,090 --> 03:29:29,450
Hey Hey

8010
03:29:29,450 --> 03:29:30,050
Look at me!! Look at me!!

8011
03:29:30,050 --> 03:29:31,350
Look at me!! Look at me!!

8012
03:29:31,350 --> 03:29:33,820
(Just Okada) Not enough practice!!

8013
03:29:33,820 --> 03:29:35,690
Not enough practice!!

8014
03:29:38,150 --> 03:29:41,480
Man... How many times does he plan on turning around?

8015
03:29:39,330 --> 03:29:41,480
Really?

8016
03:29:43,270 --> 03:29:43,930
This year, Happy Boy is still happy, huh

8017
03:29:43,930 --> 03:29:46,600
This year, Happy Boy is still happy, huh

8018
03:29:49,070 --> 03:29:54,100
6:00 PM - 10 hours have passed

8019
03:29:54,630 --> 03:29:58,510
And they're complaining about the physical punishments

8020
03:29:59,180 --> 03:30:00,520
What's wrong?

8021
03:30:00,520 --> 03:30:02,380
Muscle pain

8022
03:30:02,750 --> 03:30:04,020
Muscle pain? From what?

8023
03:30:03,650 --> 03:30:04,890
Yes

8024
03:30:04,020 --> 03:30:04,890
Muscle pain? From what?

8025
03:30:05,250 --> 03:30:07,020
Don't Get Caught

8026
03:30:07,020 --> 03:30:10,990
When they hit your butt, your whole upper half goes like this

8027
03:30:09,710 --> 03:30:10,990
You stiffen, yeah

8028
03:30:10,990 --> 03:30:12,760
Oh, how does it go?

8029
03:30:12,190 --> 03:30:13,700
It goes *slap* And then you go, "Ahh!"

8030
03:30:13,700 --> 03:30:14,500
Around here the muscle tightens up

8031
03:30:14,500 --> 03:30:16,560
Around here the muscle tightens up

8032
03:30:16,570 --> 03:30:18,730
When you do it over and over, your muscles become tense

8033
03:30:18,770 --> 03:30:20,740
If you did it 5 times in a row, what would that be like?

8034
03:30:20,740 --> 03:30:21,670
If you did it 5 times in a row, what would that be like?

8035
03:30:21,020 --> 03:30:22,220
5 times would be like

8036
03:30:25,410 --> 03:30:26,440
Something like that, I think

8037
03:30:29,510 --> 03:30:32,510
But you wouldn't have to do it 5 times anyway

8038
03:30:30,490 --> 03:30:32,510
Yeah, that doesn't happen

8039
03:30:32,510 --> 03:30:37,390
If you did it 20 times in a row

8040
03:30:34,320 --> 03:30:37,390
I really wonder what would happen?

8041
03:30:37,390 --> 03:30:39,520
That would be amazing, really

8042
03:30:39,750 --> 03:30:41,010
It's because you did
it that one time...

8043
03:30:41,740 --> 03:30:43,040
You get caught

8044
03:30:43,040 --> 03:30:44,590
They get you so quickly

8045
03:30:52,880 --> 03:30:54,480
...Like that, right?

8046
03:30:53,850 --> 03:30:57,320
...Like that, right?

8047
03:30:58,510 --> 03:30:59,110
Partway through, you turned into Takeshi-san

8048
03:30:58,510 --> 03:31:05,110
T/N: He's referring to Beat Takeshi (comedian, actor, film director) who has facial spasms due to an accident.

8049
03:30:59,110 --> 03:31:02,910
Partway through, you turned into Takeshi-san

8050
03:31:02,190 --> 03:31:05,130
If you were going to turn into anyone, he was a good choice

8051
03:31:05,480 --> 03:31:07,680
Why don't you try becoming him? (Beat Takeshi)

8052
03:31:07,680 --> 03:31:09,920
Midway through, become more like him

8053
03:31:09,920 --> 03:31:12,050
That would probably be good - 10 times

8054
03:31:09,920 --> 03:31:15,490
Increasingly Takeshi Challenge

8055
03:31:09,920 --> 03:31:15,490
Increasingly Takeshi Challenge

8056
03:31:12,050 --> 03:31:15,490
And at the very end, you completely turn into Beat Takeshi

8057
03:31:15,820 --> 03:31:18,330
If you can make it all the way you could tour the country!!

8058
03:31:18,330 --> 03:31:21,230
If you can make it all the way you could tour the country!!

8059
03:31:20,040 --> 03:31:21,230
Tour the country...?

8060
03:31:22,330 --> 03:31:24,470
Okay, I'll do it

8061
03:31:25,800 --> 03:31:28,750
You're already him, from the very start, though!!

8062
03:31:28,860 --> 03:31:29,940
Too fast!!

8063
03:31:30,150 --> 03:31:31,940
Really?

8064
03:31:31,250 --> 03:31:33,860
Ooooh yeah, you were way too fast

8065
03:31:31,940 --> 03:31:35,040
Yeah, you need to start as Endo- be more like Endo

8066
03:31:35,040 --> 03:31:37,040
What? But I wasn't being Takeshi just now

8067
03:31:37,700 --> 03:31:39,760
I was just saying "aah" like normal

8068
03:31:39,810 --> 03:31:40,540
No you weren't

8069
03:31:41,150 --> 03:31:42,680
So I need to start lower?

8070
03:31:41,180 --> 03:31:44,950
Increasingly Takeshi Challenge Do-Over

8071
03:31:41,180 --> 03:31:44,950
Increasingly Takeshi Challenge Do-Over

8072
03:31:42,680 --> 03:31:43,570
I think so

8073
03:31:57,200 --> 03:31:57,840
That's good

8074
03:32:00,080 --> 03:32:01,180
That was really good

8075
03:32:01,800 --> 03:32:03,640
What's wrong Endo?

8076
03:32:07,570 --> 03:32:10,160
What's wrong Endo, what's wrong?

8077
03:32:09,730 --> 03:32:12,010
My back...

8078
03:32:12,010 --> 03:32:16,420
During Absolutely Don't Get Caught they got his back

8079
03:32:13,360 --> 03:32:14,450
His back, huh?

8080
03:32:14,450 --> 03:32:15,430
They got his back bad

8081
03:32:15,410 --> 03:32:17,730
That's right

8082
03:32:18,790 --> 03:32:22,790
If they hurt his back that bad

8083
03:32:20,560 --> 03:32:22,790
we can't play with Endo anymore

8084
03:32:20,750 --> 03:32:22,790
No, no, it was a coincidence

8085
03:32:22,790 --> 03:32:24,090
Honestly, I kind of stiffened up

8086
03:32:24,090 --> 03:32:26,630
Honestly, I kind of stiffened up

8087
03:32:28,130 --> 03:32:29,770
Coincidentally?

8088
03:32:30,090 --> 03:32:32,470
Yeah, I'm fine, I just stiffened up

8089
03:32:33,080 --> 03:32:34,210
Hey guys

8090
03:32:34,670 --> 03:32:37,310
Right now, in this very building

8091
03:32:37,310 --> 03:32:41,380
A world famous illusionist is doing

8092
03:32:39,210 --> 03:32:41,380
his big escape show, it seems

8093
03:32:41,380 --> 03:32:45,810
Since you're Treasure Hunters,

8094
03:32:42,910 --> 03:32:45,810
having some skills in escaping may be of some use to you

8095
03:32:46,260 --> 03:32:52,190
They will studiously observe the

8096
03:32:46,260 --> 03:32:52,190
world famous illusionist's big escape show!!

8097
03:32:52,690 --> 03:32:54,960
The five hurry to the show location

8098
03:32:55,530 --> 03:32:56,600
When suddenly

8099
03:32:58,960 --> 03:33:01,730
Everyone, could you wait here a moment?

8100
03:33:01,730 --> 03:33:09,700
That parade song echoes down the hall

8101
03:33:05,210 --> 03:33:06,950
Electrical parade?

8102
03:33:14,140 --> 03:33:15,610
What? Parade?

8103
03:33:15,610 --> 03:33:17,180
What? Parade?

8104
03:33:17,260 --> 03:33:19,650
I've heard this song before...

8105
03:33:18,580 --> 03:33:20,610
Yeah, Electrical Parade

8106
03:33:20,980 --> 03:33:22,250
Again??

8107
03:33:23,350 --> 03:33:24,550
He's covered in lights

8108
03:33:24,550 --> 03:33:27,560
Robo-Ototake's 2nd Appearance!!

8109
03:33:25,700 --> 03:33:27,890
Come on, Ototake...

8110
03:33:27,890 --> 03:33:30,830
Why don't you go home already!!

8111
03:33:31,530 --> 03:33:33,730
The little ones are following him

8112
03:33:32,640 --> 03:33:33,380
Amazing

8113
03:33:35,730 --> 03:33:36,800
He's too into it, it's creeping me out

8114
03:33:36,800 --> 03:33:38,300
He's too into it, it's creeping me out

8115
03:33:38,520 --> 03:33:41,050
Oh they're so small!

8116
03:33:38,520 --> 03:33:41,050
Oh, what now?

8117
03:33:41,640 --> 03:33:44,440
That's amazing~

8118
03:33:44,730 --> 03:33:46,240
That's amazing

8119
03:33:49,440 --> 03:33:51,440
Why's this (power cable) so long?

8120
03:33:51,870 --> 03:33:54,570
That power cable is super long

8121
03:33:51,880 --> 03:33:54,750
A super long lighting cable

8122
03:33:55,480 --> 03:33:57,420
That's crazy long

8123
03:33:57,420 --> 03:33:59,690

8124
03:33:57,420 --> 03:33:59,690

Ototake-san

8126
03:34:04,160 --> 03:34:07,230
She said "Ototake-san, stop!!"

8127
03:34:05,850 --> 03:34:07,230
I heard that

8128
03:34:06,370 --> 03:34:07,230
Stop! Stop!

8129
03:34:11,170 --> 03:34:14,800

It's an era-defining escape, how are you feeling right now?

03:36:12,590 --> 03:36:13,690
That's right, thank you all...

That's right, thank you all...

8190
03:36:14,020 --> 03:36:18,290
He can speak Japanese!!

8191
03:36:14,730 --> 03:36:15,710
He's speaking Japanese

8192
03:36:14,990 --> 03:36:18,290

He's got the right fighting spirit

8200
03:36:39,550 --> 03:36:41,650
He can't make a mistake, no matter what...

8201
03:36:40,810 --> 03:36:43,520
Now, I will explain the escape process

8202
03:36:43,710 --> 03:36:46,760
First, both of David Kawashima's ankles

8203
03:36:47,210 --> 03:36:49,820
Will be fastened together

8204
03:36:50,490 --> 03:36:53,460
He must release himself

8205
03:36:50,490 --> 03:36:56,600
Both legs are fastened with padlocks

8206
03:36:50,490 --> 03:36:56,600

8207
03:36:50,490 --> 03:36:56,600

8208
03:36:53,460 --> 03:36:57,530
From the 2 padlocks on his legs

8209
03:36:57,460 --> 03:36:59,900
This is for real...

8210
03:36:59,240 --> 03:37:01,600
Next, David Kawashima

8211
03:37:01,600 --> 03:37:04,690
Has both hands fastened with weights

8212
03:37:04,690 --> 03:37:07,150
To escape these weights,

8213
03:37:04,710 --> 03:37:12,680
Each hand has 10kg attached with padlocks

8214
03:37:04,710 --> 03:37:12,680
T/N: 10kg is 22 pounds.

8215
03:37:04,710 --> 03:37:12,680

8216
03:37:04,710 --> 03:37:12,680
m 0 0 l 850 0 l 835 80 l 20 85

8217
03:37:07,150 --> 03:37:12,680
He will have to remove both padlocks

8218
03:37:12,680 --> 03:37:16,580
Wait, that's...

8219
03:37:13,370 --> 03:37:16,290
Wow, David Kawashima is amazing

8220
03:37:16,880 --> 03:37:18,590
The 4 keys are collected

8221
03:37:18,590 --> 03:37:22,960
The 4 keys are collected

8222
03:37:23,650 --> 03:37:28,400
Now, the keys will all be thrown into the water

8223
03:37:26,360 --> 03:37:30,200
The 4 keys are thrown in the water

8224
03:37:26,360 --> 03:37:30,200

8225
03:37:26,360 --> 03:37:30,200

8226
03:37:29,790 --> 03:37:30,560
Now

8227
03:37:30,780 --> 03:37:32,440
They have been thrown in

8228
03:37:33,740 --> 03:37:35,700
Now, David Kawashima

8229
03:37:35,970 --> 03:37:41,680
With the 4 padlocks in place,

8230
03:37:39,210 --> 03:37:41,680
enters standby

8231
03:37:41,680 --> 03:37:45,010
That seems to be pretty heavy

8232
03:37:42,440 --> 03:37:44,160
I think he looks determined

8233
03:37:43,640 --> 03:37:47,490
Turning to face his historic escape, he begins climbing the stairs

8234
03:37:48,120 --> 03:37:49,350
He moves heavily

8235
03:37:49,870 --> 03:37:52,390
You can hear the heft of his weights

8236
03:37:52,390 --> 03:37:55,960
His face is different than before

8237
03:37:54,450 --> 03:37:56,050
You can feel the tension in the air

8238
03:37:54,480 --> 03:37:55,930
You're right

8239
03:37:56,730 --> 03:37:59,370
And for the climax of this amazing escape

8240
03:37:59,670 --> 03:38:02,570
The lid will be closed on David Kawashima

8241
03:38:02,990 --> 03:38:06,170
And he will be chained in with another lock

8242
03:38:04,600 --> 03:38:10,970
The lid will be locked and the key thrown inside

8243
03:38:04,600 --> 03:38:10,970

03:38:10,080 --> 03:38:10,960
To summarize

8247
03:38:11,200 --> 03:38:15,690
First, David Kawashima will open 4 locks underwater

8248
03:38:14,280 --> 03:38:31,730
Remove the 4 padlocks on his arms and legs

8251
03:38:16,400 --> 03:38:20,350
Finally, using this hole which fits only one arm

8252
03:38:18,750 --> 03:38:21,920
Lid Hole

8253
03:38:18,750 --> 03:38:21,920

8254
03:38:18,750 --> 03:38:31,730
Use the hole to open the 5th padlock

8255
03:38:20,770 --> 03:38:21,860
He will extend his arm

8256
03:38:22,460 --> 03:38:27,290
He will unlock the chained padlock, and escape

8257
03:38:25,250 --> 03:38:31,730
5th padlock

8259
03:38:27,770 --> 03:38:31,160
Meeting the challenge of a historic illusion!

8260
03:38:32,130 --> 03:38:35,300
This is an amazing illusion

8261
03:38:32,920 --> 03:38:35,520
Everyone note,

8262
03:38:36,350 --> 03:38:39,830
You can confirm his actions from the camera installed above as well

8265
03:38:41,490 --> 03:38:42,660
And with that

8266
03:38:41,920 --> 03:38:42,990
Over there?

8267
03:38:43,060 --> 03:38:43,570
Yeah

8268
03:38:43,900 --> 03:38:47,640
Mr. David Kawashima, please enter the water

8269
03:38:53,810 --> 03:38:56,420
He's all the way in

8270
03:38:54,510 --> 03:38:56,410
Seriously?

8271
03:38:56,410 --> 03:38:58,410
Wow...

8272
03:38:57,610 --> 03:38:58,610
He's filling up

8273
03:38:59,520 --> 03:39:02,120
That's filled to the brim...

8274
03:39:00,440 --> 03:39:01,780
Yeah, it's perfectly filled

8275
03:39:02,310 --> 03:39:04,090
The preparations are all complete

8276
03:39:05,960 --> 03:39:09,100
Mr. David Kawashima, have you prepared yourself?

8277
03:39:09,100 --> 03:39:12,530
Mr. David Kawashima, have you prepared yourself?

8278
03:39:13,520 --> 03:39:14,380
Understood

8279
03:39:14,680 --> 03:39:16,400
His face pisses me off...

8280
03:39:15,370 --> 03:39:17,270
Shouldn't he speak up a little more?

8281
03:39:16,620 --> 03:39:17,250
Right?

8282
03:39:17,430 --> 03:39:18,820
Well then, let's continue!

8283
03:39:19,940 --> 03:39:20,950
David Kawashima's

8284
03:39:21,650 --> 03:39:22,550
Era-defining

8285
03:39:22,920 --> 03:39:25,800
Underwater Escape Illusion countdown!

8286
03:39:33,650 --> 03:39:33,970
Underwater Escape Start!!

8287
03:39:33,650 --> 03:39:38,330
Underwater Escape Start!!

8288
03:39:33,650 --> 03:39:38,330
Underwater Escape Start!!

8289
03:39:33,650 --> 03:39:38,330
Underwater Escape Start!!

8290
03:39:33,950 --> 03:39:34,820
Underwater Escape Start!!

8291
03:39:39,130 --> 03:39:42,950
We have started, so now the lid is closed

8292
03:39:39,500 --> 03:39:42,720
Wow, he's doing it

8293
03:39:42,950 --> 03:39:45,650
And locked up with chains

8294
03:39:45,700 --> 03:39:47,130
The padlock has now been secured

8295
03:39:47,130 --> 03:39:48,340
The padlock has now been secured

8296
03:39:48,340 --> 03:39:51,770
And the key has been thrown in

8297
03:39:51,770 --> 03:39:54,140
And in that time, suddenly-

8298
03:39:54,400 --> 03:39:56,710
David Kawashima is on... his left wrist?

8299
03:39:56,930 --> 03:39:59,190
Is that his right wrist?

8300
03:39:59,960 --> 03:40:01,500
First is his right ankle

8301
03:40:01,510 --> 03:40:03,500
He's really calm, huh

8302
03:40:02,560 --> 03:40:03,890
How are we doing?

8303
03:40:05,080 --> 03:40:07,150
It's open

8304
03:40:07,150 --> 03:40:09,320
Slow and steady

8305
03:40:07,930 --> 03:40:09,020
You got this!!

8306
03:40:08,820 --> 03:40:11,020
Right, if he rushes it will be even worse

8307
03:40:10,330 --> 03:40:12,500
Next is his left wrist

8308
03:40:12,170 --> 03:40:14,170
But it's already been 30 seconds

8309
03:40:14,170 --> 03:40:15,680
Now, at 30 seconds

8310
03:40:15,400 --> 03:40:16,400
That's amazing!!

8311
03:40:16,400 --> 03:40:18,800
Can he do it?

8312
03:40:16,610 --> 03:40:18,110
Did he get enough air?

8313
03:40:16,610 --> 03:40:18,600
Can you do it, David?

8314
03:40:16,630 --> 03:40:17,940
Does he have enough breath?

8315
03:40:17,510 --> 03:40:18,100
Amazing

8316
03:40:20,100 --> 03:40:21,360
Does he have enough air left?

8317
03:40:22,610 --> 03:40:25,000
Let's go David!

8318
03:40:23,510 --> 03:40:24,990
That's incredible, though

8319
03:40:24,990 --> 03:40:26,990
His right wrist now, and it's off!

8320
03:40:26,900 --> 03:40:28,370
OK!

8321
03:40:27,420 --> 03:40:28,370
Wow

8322
03:40:28,810 --> 03:40:32,210
Now, now with the last of his breath - the last lock

8323
03:40:29,180 --> 03:40:31,410
Up up

8324
03:40:32,850 --> 03:40:34,370
The last lock

8325
03:40:34,110 --> 03:40:35,580
You're almost there, almost there David!

8326
03:40:35,980 --> 03:40:37,620
He can't reach!

8327
03:40:37,620 --> 03:40:39,860
He forgot the key, so

8328
03:40:41,520 --> 03:40:44,030
He dropped the key!!

8329
03:40:44,950 --> 03:40:46,980
This is bad, he's stuck!

8330
03:40:45,180 --> 03:40:48,800
David what's wrong?

8331
03:40:47,410 --> 03:40:51,100
BLACKOUT!!

8332
03:40:51,690 --> 03:40:53,060
That's dangerous

8333
03:40:53,370 --> 03:40:56,070
This is really dangerous

8334
03:40:54,850 --> 03:40:56,770
Is he alright?

8335
03:40:55,670 --> 03:40:58,200
ARE YOU OKAY? HANG IN THERE!

8336
03:40:56,770 --> 03:40:58,210
You can pretty much tell!!

8337
03:40:58,350 --> 03:41:00,180
GET A HOLD OF YOURSELF!

8338
03:40:58,350 --> 03:41:01,360
David is so stupid, seriously...

8339
03:41:01,090 --> 03:41:03,960
Get a hold of yourself!

8340
03:41:04,930 --> 03:41:06,010
Get a hold of yourself!

8341
03:41:05,650 --> 03:41:07,350
What the hell...

8342
03:41:07,350 --> 03:41:09,620
He's an idiot if I ever saw one...

8343
03:41:10,530 --> 03:41:13,550
Plan this out ahead of time!

8344
03:41:13,550 --> 03:41:15,220
The padlock was too far from his reach!

8345
03:41:15,220 --> 03:41:17,760
He was doing well until then

8346
03:41:20,400 --> 03:41:23,090
I thought he could do it...

8347
03:41:23,210 --> 03:41:24,800
Well now

8348
03:41:24,380 --> 03:41:25,470
Right?

8349
03:41:24,800 --> 03:41:27,440
He did his best

8350
03:41:26,260 --> 03:41:27,440
That was incredible

8351
03:41:27,440 --> 03:41:29,380
He was even holding the key

8352
03:41:28,420 --> 03:41:29,380
That's right

8353
03:41:29,380 --> 03:41:31,380
I thought he could reach

8354
03:41:30,170 --> 03:41:31,380
That was great

8355
03:41:31,380 --> 03:41:32,710
That was great, really

8356
03:41:31,810 --> 03:41:34,840
Overhead Camera

8357
03:41:31,810 --> 03:41:34,840
m 0 0 l 340 0 340 60 0 60

8358
03:41:32,770 --> 03:41:34,840
He seems so lonely from behind

8359
03:41:34,330 --> 03:41:35,910
You guys don't know-

8360
03:41:35,910 --> 03:41:39,350
if something went wrong or not, though...

8361
03:41:39,650 --> 03:41:42,290
Maybe he was able to do it in other countries

8362
03:41:42,780 --> 03:41:45,990
It's like he let his first turtle go free

8363
03:41:48,830 --> 03:41:50,960
It looked like he was struck by calamity

8364
03:41:49,920 --> 03:41:50,960
His back, yeah

8365
03:41:50,960 --> 03:41:56,600
But

8366
03:41:51,590 --> 03:41:56,600
He's probably embarrassed, too...

8367
03:41:52,660 --> 03:41:56,600
Yeah, that's probably true

8368
03:41:58,220 --> 03:42:03,100
7:00 PM - Their next assignment is given to them

8369
03:42:04,970 --> 03:42:06,410
I have bad news everyone!!

8370
03:42:06,540 --> 03:42:13,380
Though she disappeared off the face of the earth for a while,

8371
03:42:09,380 --> 03:42:13,380
a legendary spirit medium has returned

8372
03:42:11,310 --> 03:42:13,380
a legendary spirit medium has returned

8373
03:42:13,570 --> 03:42:15,380
So, let's go

8374
03:42:15,380 --> 03:42:22,490
To see into the hearts of the Treasure Hunters,

8375
03:42:15,380 --> 03:42:22,490
the legendary spirit medium is consulted

8376
03:42:16,510 --> 03:42:17,750
A spirit medium

8377
03:42:25,170 --> 03:42:26,750
In here

8378
03:42:28,480 --> 03:42:35,540
Hall of the spirit medium

8379
03:42:29,910 --> 03:42:31,280
Oh wow, what's this smell?

8380
03:42:32,410 --> 03:42:34,700
Everyone, please hurry inside

8381
03:42:34,920 --> 03:42:39,270
She will be here any moment, so please hurry

8382
03:42:35,540 --> 03:42:39,270
Butler

8383
03:42:35,540 --> 03:42:39,270
Kendo Kobayashi

8384
03:42:39,640 --> 03:42:43,110
Everyone please pay close attention

8385
03:42:41,710 --> 03:42:43,110
"She"?

8386
03:42:43,440 --> 03:42:50,020
As she enters, we ask that you

8387
03:42:45,610 --> 03:42:50,020
refrain from being rude, please

8388
03:42:55,070 --> 03:42:59,530
Legendary Spirit Medium

8389
03:42:55,090 --> 03:42:59,530
Rola

8390
03:43:03,550 --> 03:43:06,710
Hosei loves Rola, huh?

8391
03:43:05,370 --> 03:43:06,710
That's right

8392
03:43:06,710 --> 03:43:08,710
Hold on

8393
03:43:08,740 --> 03:43:11,120
I can't help but get a bad feeling from this...

8394
03:43:09,960 --> 03:43:11,740
It's kind of scary

8395
03:43:11,360 --> 03:43:13,740
Please, be seated

8396
03:43:15,180 --> 03:43:17,640
She's got a really dumb grin on her face

8397
03:43:16,150 --> 03:43:18,690
That spells trouble

8398
03:43:16,150 --> 03:43:19,850
Seriously?

8399
03:43:17,110 --> 03:43:21,620
The Zero-Tension Spirit Medium

8400
03:43:18,860 --> 03:43:20,850
She's not tense at all

8401
03:43:19,090 --> 03:43:19,850
Right?

8402
03:43:21,040 --> 03:43:21,620
This is

8403
03:43:21,620 --> 03:43:23,520
The legendary spirit medium, Mistress Rola

8404
03:43:23,520 --> 03:43:25,950
The legendary spirit medium, Mistress Rola

8405
03:43:25,790 --> 03:43:30,570
Mistress Rola, please share your wisdom with these men

8406
03:43:27,870 --> 03:43:33,660
The spirit medium's gracious wisdom

8407
03:43:34,780 --> 03:43:34,980
Aha!

8408
03:43:34,980 --> 03:43:36,430
Aha!

8409
03:43:38,730 --> 03:43:41,000
We didn't ask for this

8410
03:43:39,730 --> 03:43:43,000
I'm begging you

8411
03:43:42,260 --> 03:43:43,900
Hang on!

8412
03:43:48,090 --> 03:43:50,140
Rola, I'm begging you - do this seriously

8413
03:43:52,580 --> 03:43:53,550

8414
03:43:53,550 --> 03:43:53,750

8415
03:43:53,750 --> 03:43:54,280

Today, Treasure HunTERS WILL

8417
03:43:57,500 --> 03:43:58,550
Today, Treasure HunTERS WILL

There's no way

8424
03:44:05,400 --> 03:44:08,010
This is impossible

8425
03:44:05,400 --> 03:44:08,010
This is totally hopeless

8426

I have seen it

8433
03:44:28,820 --> 03:44:31,300
Hosei, what is your last name, again?

8434
03:44:31,290 --> 03:44:32,450
Hosei, what is your last name, again?

8435
03:44:32,790 --> 03:44:34,660
It's Tsukitei

8436
03:44:33,670 --> 03:44:34,660
I see

8437
03:44:34,950 --> 03:44:37,190
Why is "Tsukitei" what you call yourself?

8438
03:44:37,930 --> 03:44:39,590
As Master Happo's student, Tsukitei was the name I was given

8439
03:44:39,590 --> 03:44:41,660
As Master Happo's student, Tsukitei was the name I was given

8440
03:44:42,030 --> 03:44:43,960
Asster Happo's student?

8441
03:44:44,270 --> 03:44:50,370
What does that mean?

8442
03:44:45,370 --> 03:44:50,370
Asster Happo's student, that is?

8443
03:45:00,410 --> 03:45:01,410
Everyone

8444
03:45:01,420 --> 03:45:04,620

Yes

8446
03:45:04,620 --> 03:45:07,250

This person is possessed, right

8451
03:45:24,370 --> 03:45:26,290
Is that what you felt?

8452
03:45:26,330 --> 03:45:27,890
You felt that

8453
03:45:30,900 --> 03:45:35,580

Subconscious level

8466
03:45:55,300 --> 03:45:58,210
She got them all wrong!!

8467
03:45:58,930 --> 03:46:00,210
It's written down, too...

8468
03:46:00,690 --> 03:46:03,040
Can she not read?

8469
03:46:01,850 --> 03:46:03,040
She got it all wrong

8470
03:46:05,440 --> 03:46:07,580
Hot hot hot

8471
03:46:07,580 --> 03:46:08,320

You have a strong spirit haunting you

03:46:15,260 --> 03:46:18,760
You have a strong spirit haunting you

8477
03:46:17,270 --> 03:46:18,760
Really?

8478

She said "Insi~de a mountain"

8487
03:46:37,820 --> 03:46:41,580
Was that Japanese?

8488
03:46:38,990 --> 03:46:41,580

So, everyone

8500

Do your best to gather information about treasure please

8501
03:47:12,650 --> 03:47:14,580
Well...

8502
03:47:15,050 --> 03:47:17,350
I don't really get it

8503
03:47:17,510 --> 03:47:20,150
If we don't do anything, maybe we can leave

8504
03:47:18,810 --> 03:47:20,150
I wonder...

8505
03:47:20,150 --> 03:47:21,920
The temperature difference is intense

8506
03:47:21,920 --> 03:47:25,530

Tomochika

8508
03:47:22,510 --> 03:47:25,530
This weather is unusual

8509
03:47:25,760 --> 03:47:26,930
"What am I going to wear?" they said

8510
03:47:26,930 --> 03:47:29,600
"A suit? A dress? A kimono?"

8511
03:47:29,830 --> 03:47:30,730
I'm very picky about this!!

8512
03:47:30,730 --> 03:47:32,000

8514
03:47:33,130 --> 03:47:35,300
"With this here" I said

8515
03:47:35,300 --> 03:47:36,970
The construction hasn't been finished at all!

8516
03:47:36,970 --> 03:47:40,370
I called up Takenaka,

8517
03:47:38,270 --> 03:47:40,370
"It doesn't go thump, you know?" I said

8518
03:47:40,370 --> 03:47:44,080
"What thump?"

8519
03:47:44,290 --> 03:47:48,380
I told him, but he didn't pass it on

8520
03:47:44,290 --> 03:47:48,380
They've already laughed, but please enjoy watching for now

8523
03:47:49,980 --> 03:47:51,850
"Thank you, Takenaka" I said

8524
03:47:52,420 --> 03:47:54,220
You get it, right?

8525
03:47:56,460 --> 03:47:57,590
Yuri-chan, we have customers

8526
03:47:57,590 --> 03:48:00,760
Yuri-chan, we have customers

8527
03:47:59,590 --> 03:48:02,100
Yes!

8528
03:48:00,820 --> 03:48:02,100
Make sure you bring some alcohol

8529

Bar Hostess

8530
03:48:02,100 --> 03:48:06,000
Good evening, excuse me

8531
03:48:02,100 --> 03:48:06,000
T/N: Yuriyan Retriever is a Japanese comedian whose humor is to be really awkward and say odd things in English.

8532
03:48:02,100 --> 03:48:06,000
Yuriyan Retriever

8533
03:48:06,230 --> 03:48:08,340
She's been here 3 months

8534
03:48:07,660 --> 03:48:10,340
I had just dropped out of college

8535
03:48:10,440 --> 03:48:12,210
If you hadn't found me...

8536
03:48:12,210 --> 03:48:12,740
By now I'd be a stray cat

8537
03:48:12,740 --> 03:48:14,270
By now I'd be a stray cat

8538
03:48:14,270 --> 03:48:15,040
Better than a thieving cat

8539
03:48:15,040 --> 03:48:16,140
Better than a thieving cat

8540
03:48:16,140 --> 03:48:18,750
T/N: In Japanese, "thieving cat" also means homewrecker.

8541
03:48:16,140 --> 03:48:18,750
You're the thieving cat!

8542
03:48:18,750 --> 03:48:19,180
I'm a Persian cat

8543
03:48:19,180 --> 03:48:21,380
I'm a Persian cat

8544
03:48:24,320 --> 03:48:25,620
This is annoying

8545
03:48:26,890 --> 03:48:28,960
I'm eating nuts, even though it's winter

8546
03:48:26,890 --> 03:48:31,330
T/N: Nuts are pronounced "nattsu". The word for summer is "natsu". So eating nuts in the winter/nuts aren't just for summer is a play-on-words.

8547
03:48:28,960 --> 03:48:31,330
It's not just for summer, like I say

8548
03:48:31,330 --> 03:48:32,960
That's silly~

8549
03:48:34,620 --> 03:48:36,230

She's always playing hooky

8553
03:48:40,570 --> 03:48:41,970
Takahashi!!

8554
03:48:43,970 --> 03:48:45,840

Could you not take so long?

8559
03:48:46,950 --> 03:48:47,940
Good evening

8560
03:48:48,280 --> 03:48:49,410
You know, rather than remembering your job

8561
03:48:49,410 --> 03:48:51,150
You know, rather than remembering your job

8562
03:48:51,150 --> 03:48:53,580
It seems like you only remember to play with boys, huh?

8563
03:48:55,110 --> 03:48:56,150
That's not true, is it?

8564
03:48:55,720 --> 03:48:56,150
No

8565
03:48:56,150 --> 03:48:58,810
Yuri-chan, you know that, don't say such things

8566
03:48:58,810 --> 03:49:00,810
You say that, but I don't know

8567
03:49:01,310 --> 03:49:04,640
Hey you, I'm telling you

8568
03:49:05,110 --> 03:49:08,060
Yuri-chan, why don't you tell us something good about yourself?

8569
03:49:08,060 --> 03:49:10,060
Something good about me?

8570
03:49:11,160 --> 03:49:12,460
There aren't any...

8571
03:49:13,810 --> 03:49:15,270
Just try

8572
03:49:15,530 --> 03:49:18,270
Compared to others, your sitting height is tall

8573
03:49:18,270 --> 03:49:20,270
Compared to others, your sitting height is tall

8574
03:49:20,270 --> 03:49:22,640
Please don't talk about my sitting height

8575
03:49:22,640 --> 03:49:25,510
Takahashi, try sitting down over there

8576
03:49:24,370 --> 03:49:25,010
Okay

8577
03:49:25,510 --> 03:49:26,980
Takahashi is good looking in every way

8578
03:49:27,680 --> 03:49:28,920
She's good on the inside, and she's tall

8579
03:49:28,920 --> 03:49:30,080
She's good on the inside, and she's tall

8580
03:49:30,480 --> 03:49:32,990
How about you both kneel

8581
03:49:37,790 --> 03:49:40,190
Your sitting height is so high~

8582
03:49:40,890 --> 03:49:43,200
The height difference is 20 cm

8583
03:49:43,660 --> 03:49:46,130
You don't even need to put on takageta,

8584
03:49:43,660 --> 03:49:49,130
T/N: Geta are a traditional Japanese sandals. Takageta are geta that are tall, kind of like platform shoes.

8585

8586
03:49:47,400 --> 03:49:48,640
For you, the tall-sitting journey is possible

8587
03:49:49,500 --> 03:49:50,670
Listen, you can almost hear the bells and taiko drums

8588
03:49:50,670 --> 03:49:51,540
Listen, you can almost hear the bells and taiko drums

8589
03:49:51,540 --> 03:49:54,170
Listen, you can almost hear the bells and taiko drums

8590
03:49:54,170 --> 03:49:54,580
Ting Tong Shang, right?

8591
03:49:54,580 --> 03:49:54,970
Ting Tong Shang, right?

8592
03:49:54,970 --> 03:49:55,240
Ting Tong Shang, right?

8593
03:49:55,240 --> 03:49:55,840
Ting Tong Shang, right?

8594
03:49:56,480 --> 03:49:59,250
A tall-sitter is passing through

8595
03:50:00,240 --> 03:50:03,680
Everyone in town, everyone in the village, gather round!

8596
03:50:00,650 --> 03:50:03,680

Takahashi?

9655
03:52:49,020 --> 03:52:51,120
They all got away, Takahashi

9656
03:52:49,680 --> 03:52:51,120
You're free to go

9657
03:52:51,120 --> 03:52:53,350
They got away

9658
03:52:51,120 --> 03:52:53,350
You can go

9659
03:52:53,790 --> 03:52:55,060
Takahashi

9660
03:52:55,060 --> 03:52:57,190
How long are you going to be doing that?

9661
03:52:57,320 --> 03:52:59,810
She's going now

9662
03:52:58,990 --> 03:52:59,810
Yeah

9663
03:52:59,810 --> 03:53:01,590
That's good news

9664
03:53:01,600 --> 03:53:03,030
Wha-?

9665
03:53:03,760 --> 03:53:04,700
Are you kidding me?

9666
03:53:04,710 --> 03:53:06,000
Come on

9667
03:53:09,280 --> 03:53:11,290
It was so long

9668
03:53:09,770 --> 03:53:11,290
Way too long

9669
03:53:11,700 --> 03:53:13,110
We had enough

9670
03:53:17,480 --> 03:53:18,980
What the hell? I mean

9671
03:53:18,980 --> 03:53:21,480
Not a single treasure hunter has come yet

9672
03:53:21,930 --> 03:53:23,470
Right

9673
03:53:25,100 --> 03:53:28,690
I hope Fujiwara will come here soon

9674
03:53:27,300 --> 03:53:28,800
Really, I had enough

9675
03:53:27,800 --> 03:53:28,800
Right

9676
03:53:28,800 --> 03:53:31,260
We all had enough

9677
03:53:29,440 --> 03:53:31,260
This isn't really treasure hunter-ish

9678
03:53:32,470 --> 03:53:33,340
Welcome

9679
03:53:33,340 --> 03:53:34,310
Can we sit?

9680
03:53:34,310 --> 03:53:36,200
Of course

9681
03:53:34,810 --> 03:53:36,200
We'll take the usual then

9682
03:53:36,200 --> 03:53:37,530
Ok, got it

9683
03:53:37,530 --> 03:53:41,400

Gin-Shari

9685
03:53:39,080 --> 03:53:41,130
Man, I'm beat up

9686
03:53:39,080 --> 03:53:41,130
Yeah, for real

9687
03:53:41,130 --> 03:53:42,920
The situation is pretty tough

9688
03:53:41,130 --> 03:53:42,920
Yeah...

9689
03:53:42,920 --> 03:53:44,970
There's not a single spot left

9690
03:53:44,970 --> 03:53:48,110
T/N: Yuichi Kimura is a comedian, actor, TV script writer, and columnist.

9691
03:53:44,970 --> 03:53:48,110
Treasure Hunter

Yuichi Kimura

9692
03:53:45,040 --> 03:53:46,940
They dug everything out

9693
03:53:45,770 --> 03:53:46,940
Sorry I'm late

9694
03:53:46,940 --> 03:53:48,110
Good evening

9695
03:53:48,240 --> 03:53:49,110
Kept you waiting?

9696
03:53:49,630 --> 03:53:51,040
We knew you would come

9697
03:53:51,390 --> 03:53:54,000
Doesn't seem like we'll retire any soon, huh?

9698
03:53:53,280 --> 03:53:58,290
The treasure hunters are facing hard times

9699
03:53:54,660 --> 03:53:56,700
Yeah, what can we do?

9700
03:53:56,700 --> 03:53:58,700
We just run out of luck

9701
03:53:58,700 --> 03:53:59,490
Yeah but

9702
03:53:59,490 --> 03:54:02,960
The research group of a guy I know recently went to Africa

9703
03:54:02,960 --> 03:54:07,430
And managed to dig up so much gold,







he made a fortune worth his lifetime

9704
03:54:07,430 --> 03:54:08,330
Oh man

9705
03:54:08,330 --> 03:54:13,330
Speaking of making a fortune...







The Japanese comedian Hitoshi Matsumoto too...

9706
03:54:13,330 --> 03:54:16,740
I heard he made an unbelievable fortune

9707
03:54:16,740 --> 03:54:21,110
Well, if we're talking about him,







he made a fortune cause he earned it, you know

9708
03:54:21,570 --> 03:54:23,580
Kimura-san, do you happen to know Matsumoto-san, by chance?

9709
03:54:23,580 --> 03:54:24,910
Well, kind of, yes

9710
03:54:24,910 --> 03:54:27,380
Can I ask you a question?

9711
03:54:26,710 --> 03:54:27,400
What is it?

9712
03:54:27,400 --> 03:54:33,190
He once wrote in one of his books "a comedian must not work out"

9713
03:54:33,190 --> 03:54:37,660
But now, he's so muscular, isn't he?







What do you think that means?

9714
03:54:37,790 --> 03:54:41,660
I don't think that working out is something bad, you know

9715
03:54:41,780 --> 03:54:44,430
Yeah, but in his book...

9716
03:54:43,110 --> 03:54:44,430
We all read it

9717
03:54:44,430 --> 03:54:50,300
You mean "Will", his book? He's just joking around, come on

9718
03:54:44,430 --> 03:54:51,610
"Will" / Hitoshi Matsumoto (1994)

9719
03:54:44,430 --> 03:54:51,610
Asahi Press "Will" by Matsumoto Hitoshi

9720
03:54:45,160 --> 03:54:46,400
Oh, I see

9721
03:54:50,320 --> 03:54:51,610
Yeah, but he also said

9722
03:54:51,610 --> 03:54:56,740
"If a comedian dyes his hair, he'll stain himself."







That's also part of the book he wrote

9723
03:54:56,740 --> 03:54:58,150
In "Will", yes?

9724
03:54:58,150 --> 03:55:00,810
But isn't he excessively blonde right now...?

9725
03:55:00,810 --> 03:55:02,180
What does that mean, you think?

9726
03:55:02,180 --> 03:55:06,790
I think that the whole "stain" thing is just a concept, you know

9727
03:55:06,790 --> 03:55:11,060
Some believe that people who dye their hair blonde







have stained themselves

9728
03:55:11,060 --> 03:55:12,530
But that doesn't mean blonde = stain

9729
03:55:12,530 --> 03:55:14,190
It's between the lines

9730
03:55:14,560 --> 03:55:17,400
The lines..?

9731
03:55:15,690 --> 03:55:17,400
Yeah, something in between

9732
03:55:17,400 --> 03:55:21,400
You think Matsumoto is stained right now?

9733
03:55:19,180 --> 03:55:21,400
No, I don't think so

9734
03:55:21,400 --> 03:55:26,670
"I'm going to retire by the time I'm 40."







That's written in his book too

9735
03:55:25,470 --> 03:55:26,670
"Will", right?

9736
03:55:26,870 --> 03:55:29,080
But isn't he 55 by now?

9737
03:55:29,080 --> 03:55:30,510
What does it mean?

9738
03:55:30,510 --> 03:55:34,010
It's "Will", you know, it's as if he's planning to die, you know

9739
03:55:34,010 --> 03:55:36,950
He wrote that thinking "I could die at any time"

9740
03:55:36,950 --> 03:55:39,920
He was 9 years away from his 40s, that's why he thought that

9741
03:55:39,920 --> 03:55:45,220
But now he's 55, so maybe







he'll postpone (his retirement) to his 60s and so on, like this

9742
03:55:45,230 --> 03:55:47,090
I have a question about Hamada...

9743
03:55:47,090 --> 03:55:50,160
Why is Hamada always







wearing a pair of sunglasses?

9744
03:55:51,860 --> 03:55:54,430
How would I know?

9745
03:55:54,430 --> 03:55:57,240
There's a difference in interest

9746
03:55:56,000 --> 03:55:58,140
I knew he was gonna say it

9747
03:55:58,890 --> 03:56:01,090
He knows only about me

9748
03:56:02,170 --> 03:56:04,160
I'm his favorite topic

9749
03:56:05,710 --> 03:56:08,350
Even people who aren't Hamada...

9750
03:56:06,930 --> 03:56:08,350
Not Hamada, though

9751
03:56:08,350 --> 03:56:09,980
About Hamada, again...

9752
03:56:09,980 --> 03:56:13,550
When they press him to do his recording,







why does he get so angry about it?

9753
03:56:13,950 --> 03:56:16,920
I don't know man, ask him yourself

9754
03:56:20,430 --> 03:56:22,200
He's brutal

9755
03:56:22,640 --> 03:56:24,280
Yeah, why?

9756
03:56:24,930 --> 03:56:29,400
He's so different when it comes to Matsumoto-san

9757
03:56:26,230 --> 03:56:28,200
He really likes him

9758
03:56:30,370 --> 03:56:32,470
So different when it's about Matsumoto-san

9759
03:56:30,370 --> 03:56:32,470
That's impressive

9760
03:56:32,550 --> 03:56:34,640
You should just ask him

9761
03:56:34,640 --> 03:56:36,360
Doesn't he really care?

9762
03:56:36,880 --> 03:56:39,410
I'm positive he doesn't hate him

9763
03:56:37,930 --> 03:56:39,410
Yeah, no way

9764
03:56:38,540 --> 03:56:39,410
He doesn't

9765
03:56:39,410 --> 03:56:45,790
Back on Matsumoto-san again...







back when he used to do"Gottsu ee Kanji" and so

9766
03:56:45,790 --> 03:56:47,550
His personality was more prickly

9767
03:56:47,550 --> 03:56:54,030
But now especially with younger comedians,







he's always joking around or such

9768
03:56:54,030 --> 03:56:56,130
He speaks with no formalities too

9769
03:56:56,130 --> 03:56:58,330
What do you think that means?

9770
03:57:00,970 --> 03:57:04,000
He's been a kind person from the beginning...

9771
03:57:09,240 --> 03:57:12,210
What with these feelings?

9772
03:57:13,150 --> 03:57:14,410
He's getting emotional

9773
03:57:14,410 --> 03:57:15,600
That's no good

9774
03:57:15,220 --> 03:57:19,650
All the way down his roots, he's a kind person

9775
03:57:19,650 --> 03:57:21,090
Back from when he did Gottsu?

9776
03:57:21,090 --> 03:57:25,990
I personally never thought of him







as a prickly person

9777
03:57:25,990 --> 03:57:27,990
The staff often said to him like

9778
03:57:27,990 --> 03:57:32,800
"You seem to be in good spirits today" or such

9779
03:57:32,800 --> 03:57:36,570
"He's always like this!" - that's what I always thought

9780
03:57:36,570 --> 03:57:40,170
He's not the kind of person who works based on mood, after all

9781
03:57:40,740 --> 03:57:45,050
2 years after my comedy debut, during the last act of a show

9782
03:57:45,050 --> 03:57:46,800
I was replying to him without much thought

9783
03:57:46,800 --> 03:57:48,550
He snorted in a laughter

9784
03:57:48,550 --> 03:57:50,880
And asked me "How long have you been doing this?"

9785
03:57:51,150 --> 03:57:53,150
I said "It's been 2 years"

9786
03:57:53,490 --> 03:57:56,860
He said "Your answers are good enough if you're on your second year"

9787
03:57:56,860 --> 03:57:59,460
"But there's no way you're fine with 'good enough'"

9788
03:58:00,030 --> 03:58:03,400
I thought he was expecting so much from me

9789
03:58:06,800 --> 03:58:09,970
He always treated you well, didn't he?

9790
03:58:09,120 --> 03:58:10,740
What kind of segment is this?!

9791
03:58:12,670 --> 03:58:15,640
Is this a note about your memories with him?

9792
03:58:12,670 --> 03:58:16,540
Memo about his memories with Matsumoto

9793
03:58:15,640 --> 03:58:16,740
That's right

9794
03:58:16,740 --> 03:58:18,910
You even wrote down Mr. Hitoshi, huh...

9795
03:58:18,910 --> 03:58:21,980
"The origin of kindness"

9796
03:58:20,850 --> 03:58:21,980
Oh, that's the title?

9797
03:58:21,980 --> 03:58:23,880
He even wrote down "Brother's!" in here

9798
03:58:22,860 --> 03:58:23,880
This...

9799
03:58:25,430 --> 03:58:28,120
I don't really want to read this

9800
03:58:29,920 --> 03:58:31,540
Of course you don't

9801
03:58:32,840 --> 03:58:34,930
He's serious about it

9802
03:58:34,930 --> 03:58:36,830
You can tell it

9803
03:58:36,830 --> 03:58:38,470
He's really serious about this

9804
03:58:41,630 --> 03:58:43,700
He's getting emotional for real

9805
03:58:42,900 --> 03:58:43,700
Yeah

9806
03:58:43,700 --> 03:58:48,610
He's conveying his feelings so well

9807
03:58:45,870 --> 03:58:48,610
Feels like this isn't a business anymore

9808
03:58:48,790 --> 03:58:55,720
It's been 13 hours since the start, the 5 of them are covered in wounds

9809
03:58:55,720 --> 03:59:03,590
And finally Hosei's arch-enemy will make his appearance!!

9810
03:59:05,060 --> 03:59:08,390
14 hours since their work started

9811
03:59:08,390 --> 03:59:13,200
Our five heroes are so exhausted they barely even talk, but...

9812
03:59:13,370 --> 03:59:17,970
A big event will shake the research institute! The greatest discovery of this century!

9813
03:59:18,200 --> 03:59:19,390
You ok?

9814
03:59:20,890 --> 03:59:34,750
Announcement

9815
03:59:20,890 --> 03:59:34,750
State of emergency! The cursed mummy of the Hipopo tribe has been found!

9816
03:59:24,240 --> 03:59:34,820
The cursed mummy of the Hipopo tribe has been found!

9817
03:59:28,160 --> 03:59:34,750
Everyone in this facility, please gather in the auditorium at once!!

9818
03:59:32,470 --> 03:59:34,200
Oh, the mummy which was stolen

9819
03:59:34,200 --> 03:59:35,190
Guys

9820
03:59:35,460 --> 03:59:36,620
The Hipopo tribe's mummy was...

9821
03:59:36,620 --> 03:59:38,460
The cursed mummy seems to have been found!!

9822
03:59:38,460 --> 03:59:41,760
Let's move from here

9823
03:59:39,160 --> 03:59:41,760
Yessir!!

9824
03:59:40,230 --> 03:59:41,760
Huhu...

9825
03:59:42,090 --> 03:59:48,130
Cursed mummy was found - to the auditorium!!

9826
03:59:42,090 --> 03:59:48,130
State of emergency

9827
03:59:42,730 --> 03:59:44,080
Let's go

9828
03:59:45,730 --> 03:59:47,280
You just laughed there

9829
03:59:47,450 --> 03:59:49,280
Hamada

9830
03:59:48,650 --> 03:59:50,910
That was funny, but...

9831
03:59:50,910 --> 03:59:52,760
You should've gotten OUT

9832
03:59:52,390 --> 03:59:54,910
Look, as expected...

9833
03:59:54,910 --> 04:00:01,520
The facility's staff have all been gathered here in a familiar environment

9834
03:59:56,450 --> 03:59:59,720
It's already been found so does it matter?

9835
04:00:03,270 --> 04:00:04,390
Ow ow ow...

9836
04:00:04,390 --> 04:00:06,040
Whew

9837
04:00:09,910 --> 04:00:11,530
Once again...

9838
04:00:10,830 --> 04:00:11,530
Everyone

9839
04:00:11,530 --> 04:00:17,630
Hakata Daikichi

9840
04:00:11,530 --> 04:00:17,630
Head researcher

9841
04:00:11,790 --> 04:00:13,850
This is a great find of this century

9842
04:00:13,850 --> 04:00:18,030
The cursed mummy which that infamous John Wood III stole from the Hipopo tribe

9843
04:00:18,030 --> 04:00:20,570
Yes, that cursed mummy has been discovered

9844
04:00:18,680 --> 04:00:23,170
The Hipopo tribe's cursed mummy has been discovered!!

9845
04:00:20,070 --> 04:00:21,320
Good for you

9846
04:00:21,320 --> 04:00:23,170
I wasn't the one who discovered the cursed mummy

9847
04:00:23,170 --> 04:00:27,880
It was discovered by a highly reputable independent treasure hunter. Here he comes!

9848
04:00:31,810 --> 04:00:34,480
Well, we all know what happens
once this music plays...

9849
04:00:33,250 --> 04:00:34,480
Yeah

9850
04:00:34,630 --> 04:00:37,720
Chono Masahiro

9851
04:00:34,630 --> 04:00:37,720
God damn!

9852
04:00:34,630 --> 04:00:37,720
Independent Treasure Hunter

9853
04:00:35,270 --> 04:00:37,720
barges in!!

9854
04:00:36,150 --> 04:00:36,650
What the hell?

9855
04:00:36,550 --> 04:00:37,740
Why is he angry?

9856
04:00:37,740 --> 04:00:41,060
They've found it already, right?

9857
04:00:37,970 --> 04:00:41,060
I don't get it...

9858
04:00:39,270 --> 04:00:40,680
Yeah

9859
04:00:39,770 --> 04:00:41,060
This time

9860
04:00:41,060 --> 04:00:48,630
I unearthed

9861
04:00:43,830 --> 04:00:48,630
the mummy which cursed John Wood III to death

9862
04:00:49,300 --> 04:00:53,600
This mummy is very dangerous

9863
04:00:53,600 --> 04:00:57,170
Hey, bring that in

9864
04:00:57,340 --> 04:01:04,180
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

9865
04:00:57,340 --> 04:01:04,180
The cursed mummy is moved in

9866
04:01:00,510 --> 04:01:02,040
How did the thief even steal that thing?

9867
04:01:04,180 --> 04:01:10,290
Inside this, there exists the

9868
04:01:06,950 --> 04:01:10,290
mummy of Hipopo tribe, which cursed John Wood III to death

9869
04:01:10,470 --> 04:01:11,790
According to our research, we understand that

9870
04:01:11,790 --> 04:01:16,790
the Hipopo tribe's curse

9871
04:01:13,390 --> 04:01:16,790
is passed down to descendants, generation to generation

9872
04:01:17,440 --> 04:01:17,960
And

9873
04:01:17,960 --> 04:01:21,260
We have an important announcement here

9874
04:01:21,260 --> 04:01:24,070
Among the treasure hunters here

9875
04:01:24,070 --> 04:01:30,140
There is someone who has inherited the mummy's curse

9876
04:01:26,770 --> 04:01:30,140
that is, we understand that he is a descendant

9877
04:01:30,320 --> 04:01:39,680
Among the treasure hunters present, there is a descendant

9878
04:01:31,990 --> 04:01:34,280
We must find that descendant

9879
04:01:34,280 --> 04:01:38,000
and end the chain of curses

9880
04:01:38,710 --> 04:01:39,680
Hey!

9881
04:01:40,080 --> 04:01:47,560
Among the people here, there's a descendant of the Pipopo tribe

9882
04:01:45,020 --> 04:01:47,560
Chono-san, it's Hipopo tribe

9883
04:01:47,560 --> 04:01:48,990
Shut up

9884
04:01:48,760 --> 04:01:49,490
"Shut up"

9885
04:01:49,860 --> 04:01:50,960
Hey!

9886
04:01:50,960 --> 04:01:52,060
Who is it?

9887
04:01:53,680 --> 04:01:56,030
No one's speaking up?

9888
04:01:54,330 --> 04:01:55,550
Someone tell him

9889
04:01:56,130 --> 04:01:57,630
Hey!!

9890
04:01:58,230 --> 04:02:00,040
We'll use that method!!

9891
04:02:00,150 --> 04:02:00,800
Hey!

9892
04:02:00,150 --> 04:02:00,800
Yes

9893
04:02:00,520 --> 04:02:08,450
The search for the descendant who inherited the curse... What method will be used?!

9894
04:02:12,880 --> 04:02:19,620
Now, we will undo the bandages on the cursed mummy

9895
04:02:17,140 --> 04:02:19,620
From investigating his body-shape and facial structure

9896
04:02:19,710 --> 04:02:22,690
the descendant can be found easily

9897
04:02:22,820 --> 04:02:23,790
Chono-san

9898
04:02:22,940 --> 04:02:27,730
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

9899
04:02:22,940 --> 04:02:27,730
Method for finding the descendant

9900
04:02:22,940 --> 04:02:27,730
Undoing the mummy's bandages to confirm the body's shape and face

9901
04:02:23,790 --> 04:02:25,230
Please undo the bandages

9902
04:02:43,460 --> 04:02:47,620
We won't know if we don't unwrap his face

9903
04:02:45,400 --> 04:02:46,470
That's right

9904
04:02:49,120 --> 04:02:54,090
Come on, please don't do this

9905
04:02:52,450 --> 04:02:54,090
Yeah, I agree

9906
04:02:54,220 --> 04:02:57,490
Like an unexpected twist or anything like that

9907
04:02:54,810 --> 04:02:57,490
Seriously, come on...

9908
04:02:58,030 --> 04:02:59,900
He has hair

9909
04:03:00,860 --> 04:03:04,170
There's no knowing yet

9910
04:03:09,080 --> 04:03:12,600
SECRET

9911
04:03:13,480 --> 04:03:16,580
There's no knowing yet

9912
04:03:30,430 --> 04:03:34,660
The one who has a similar face to this mummy is the descendant

9913
04:03:34,160 --> 04:03:35,400
We all knew it'd be him though

9914
04:03:35,400 --> 04:03:36,900
Well, yeah

9915
04:03:35,980 --> 04:03:36,980
Yeah

9916
04:03:36,900 --> 04:03:39,700
Hey you, Hamada, who is this?

9917
04:03:37,980 --> 04:03:38,550
Yes

9918
04:03:38,550 --> 04:03:39,630
Who is this?

9919
04:03:40,570 --> 04:03:44,510
I think that's probably Yamasaki...

9920
04:03:42,890 --> 04:03:44,510
No it is not!!

9921
04:03:44,510 --> 04:03:47,410
That's Hamada!!

9922
04:03:50,600 --> 04:03:51,710
He looks exactly like Hamada!

9923
04:03:51,710 --> 04:03:53,710
You're stretching it

9924
04:03:54,350 --> 04:03:58,350
No matter how I look at him, he looks like Hamada!!

9925
04:03:55,730 --> 04:03:57,150
You're wrong

9926
04:03:57,150 --> 04:03:58,350
That's definitely Hosei

9927
04:03:58,990 --> 04:04:02,890
Come over here right in front of this mummy!!

9928
04:04:01,610 --> 04:04:02,890
That's your face

9929
04:04:02,990 --> 04:04:05,030
No, it's totally different

9930
04:04:03,990 --> 04:04:09,870
Go there and if it's not you then

9931
04:04:05,410 --> 04:04:06,010
Yeah

9932
04:04:06,000 --> 04:04:09,870
you can clear the air

9933
04:04:07,160 --> 04:04:08,630
This year

9934
04:04:08,630 --> 04:04:09,870
you definitely have to tell them that's not you

9935
04:04:11,930 --> 04:04:18,170
Lining up next to the mummy to be interrogated

9936
04:04:16,200 --> 04:04:18,170
This is you!

9937
04:04:18,220 --> 04:04:19,440
No, he doesn't look like me at all

9938
04:04:19,440 --> 04:04:22,710
His hair's also totally different from mine...

9939
04:04:22,710 --> 04:04:25,380
The chain of curses has been continuing

9940
04:04:24,690 --> 04:04:25,380
Do you get it?

9941
04:04:25,550 --> 04:04:28,850
Where is this curse from? What country is it from?

9942
04:04:28,850 --> 04:04:31,450
From the Hipopo tribe

9943
04:04:30,140 --> 04:04:31,450
Oh, then you've got the wrong person

9944
04:04:31,450 --> 04:04:33,890
Because I'm from Saga prefecture!!

9945
04:04:31,450 --> 04:04:38,030
T/N: Saga prefecture is in the northwest part of the island of Kyushu. Except Hosei is actually from Hyogo prefecture, so not sure why he's saying he's from Saga.

9946
04:04:35,090 --> 04:04:38,030
You liar! Of all things though,
why would you lie about that??

9947
04:04:38,380 --> 04:04:39,740
Right?

9948
04:04:39,740 --> 04:04:40,860
What was I thinking?

9949
04:04:40,360 --> 04:04:41,850
Why not just go with Hyogo prefecture?

9950
04:04:41,510 --> 04:04:43,060
Why Saga prefecture?

9951
04:04:44,400 --> 04:04:45,600
Saga?!

9952
04:04:45,600 --> 04:04:48,740
I'm from Saga prefecture, my dad's from Saga prefecture

9953
04:04:48,740 --> 04:04:51,070
When did it become the Hipopo tribe?

9954
04:04:50,290 --> 04:04:51,070
Huh?!

9955
04:04:51,070 --> 04:04:52,280
You have been cursed!!

9956
04:04:52,620 --> 04:04:53,510
Me?

9957
04:04:53,510 --> 04:04:56,150
You want to break the curse right?

9958
04:04:55,130 --> 04:04:56,150
Yes, I want to break the curse

9959
04:04:56,280 --> 04:04:59,380
Do you want to know how to break it?

9960
04:04:57,450 --> 04:04:59,380
I want to know!!

9961
04:04:59,610 --> 04:05:04,650
The Holy Slap

9962
04:05:06,040 --> 04:05:07,240
He actually said it

9963
04:05:10,880 --> 04:05:12,290
It's all the same in the end

9964
04:05:11,340 --> 04:05:11,880
Look

9965
04:05:12,760 --> 04:05:14,280
I want to free you

9966
04:05:14,280 --> 04:05:16,280
from the curse

9967
04:05:17,120 --> 04:05:19,420
That curse will spread

9968
04:05:19,420 --> 04:05:21,370
even to your friends

9969
04:05:21,600 --> 04:05:22,590
over there

9970
04:05:22,590 --> 04:05:23,840
We don't want that

9971
04:05:22,890 --> 04:05:23,840
Do you understand?

9972
04:05:23,890 --> 04:05:25,740
We'd be troubled by that

9973
04:05:24,260 --> 04:05:25,740
Yes, we don't want the curse

9974
04:05:25,740 --> 04:05:31,910
I will carry the cross

9975
04:05:28,440 --> 04:05:31,920
and watch over what will happen to them

9976
04:05:32,280 --> 04:05:36,520
What the hell are you saying?

9977
04:05:36,520 --> 04:05:37,490
Don't play stupid!

9978
04:05:40,770 --> 04:05:42,590
"What the hell are you saying?"

9979
04:05:41,090 --> 04:05:42,590
What the heck was he saying?

9980
04:05:46,040 --> 04:05:49,030
He was told "What the hell are you saying?"

9981
04:05:49,530 --> 04:05:51,630
There is another way

9982
04:05:51,630 --> 04:05:54,740
Hey! Bring that in!!

9983
04:05:54,940 --> 04:05:59,910
What was brought in was the Golden Holy Grail

9984
04:06:00,140 --> 04:06:06,880
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

9985
04:06:00,140 --> 04:06:06,880
Method for breaking the curse

9986
04:06:00,140 --> 04:06:06,880
Pour Holy Water into the Golden Holy Grail and drink all of it

9987
04:06:00,140 --> 04:06:06,880
They say pouring Holy Water into the grail and drinking it all will break the curse

9988
04:06:07,070 --> 04:06:10,420
Good news for Hosei this year

9989
04:06:10,420 --> 04:06:13,390
No need for a slap this year

9990
04:06:11,990 --> 04:06:12,970
That means if I drink this water...

9991
04:06:12,970 --> 04:06:13,390
That's right

9992
04:06:13,410 --> 04:06:15,630
Really?

9993
04:06:14,370 --> 04:06:15,630
It's true

9994
04:06:15,630 --> 04:06:16,630
Will you do it?

9995
04:06:16,060 --> 04:06:18,760
Yes! I'll do it!

9996
04:06:17,360 --> 04:06:18,580
Thanks

9997
04:06:18,760 --> 04:06:20,330
Thank you very much!!

9998
04:06:19,060 --> 04:06:20,330
Thank you

9999
04:06:20,350 --> 04:06:22,170
That sounds good

10000
04:06:22,170 --> 04:06:24,270
Good luck!!

10001
04:06:24,370 --> 04:06:25,270
Good luck!

10002
04:06:25,270 --> 04:06:31,270
Filling the Golden Holy Grail with Holy Water

10003
04:06:39,460 --> 04:06:41,380
That's a lot

10004
04:06:49,570 --> 04:06:51,940
That seems impossible...

10005
04:06:54,450 --> 04:06:56,570
It probably contains around 2 liters?

10006
04:06:54,450 --> 04:06:59,140
T/N: 2 liters is roughly half a gallon for those who use freedom Imperial units.

10007
04:06:55,760 --> 04:06:56,800
That's quite...

10008
04:06:56,800 --> 04:06:59,140
You just need to finish drinking the Holy Water

10009
04:06:59,140 --> 04:07:04,810
If I really manage to finish drinking, there will be no slap

10010
04:07:03,760 --> 04:07:04,810
That's right

10011
04:07:04,810 --> 04:07:07,110
You must drink it all in one go!!

10012
04:07:07,110 --> 04:07:11,680
With this Holy Water, once you stop, it won't work even if you retry

10013
04:07:11,810 --> 04:07:18,920
In order to avoid the slap, he must drink it all in one go

10014
04:07:13,520 --> 04:07:14,650
Do you get it?

10015
04:07:15,230 --> 04:07:16,150
Yes

10016
04:07:16,150 --> 04:07:19,320
Okay, now recite "Oh curse, be gone" 3 times

10017
04:07:19,320 --> 04:07:20,570
Then you drink

10018
04:07:20,020 --> 04:07:20,570
Okay

10019
04:07:20,910 --> 04:07:21,440
You can do it

10020
04:07:21,440 --> 04:07:22,490
Okay

10021
04:07:23,430 --> 04:07:28,460
Oh curse, be gone

10022
04:07:24,560 --> 04:07:25,600
In a loud voice!

10023
04:07:27,250 --> 04:07:28,460
And then one more time!

10024
04:07:28,460 --> 04:07:31,600
Oh curse, be gone!!

10025
04:07:35,610 --> 04:07:40,680
Oh curse, be gone

10026
04:07:36,770 --> 04:07:37,810
In a loud voice!

10027
04:07:39,470 --> 04:07:40,680
And then one more time!

10028
04:07:40,680 --> 04:07:43,810
Oh curse, be gone!!

10029
04:07:48,520 --> 04:07:51,050
Wait a sec, what the hell are you doing?

10030
04:07:51,050 --> 04:07:55,860
The Holy Grail is unexpectedly heavy

10031
04:07:57,040 --> 04:07:58,460
Well, yeah...

10032
04:07:59,360 --> 04:08:00,460
He said it so casually...

10033
04:07:59,360 --> 04:08:03,580
T/N: Hamada is referring to Chono's Japanese being in a rude and harsh casual way of speaking towards Hosei.

10034
04:08:00,250 --> 04:08:01,460
It was funny

10035
04:08:01,930 --> 04:08:03,580
"Wait a sec, what the hell are you doing?" Pfft...

10036
04:08:03,580 --> 04:08:04,730
He already knows, right?

10037
04:08:06,720 --> 04:08:08,600
It was heavier than I thought it would be

10038
04:08:08,800 --> 04:08:10,600
Try carrying it up

10039
04:08:10,600 --> 04:08:12,310
up from below like this

10040
04:08:10,760 --> 04:08:11,970
Right, that's it

10041
04:08:11,970 --> 04:08:13,410
That's right

10042
04:08:12,310 --> 04:08:13,410
Do it like that. Here

10043
04:08:12,660 --> 04:08:13,410
Okay

10044
04:08:13,890 --> 04:08:14,730
Good luck

10045
04:08:14,730 --> 04:08:15,840
Yes

10046
04:08:14,890 --> 04:08:15,840
Do you get it?

10047
04:08:16,390 --> 04:08:17,500
Yes!

10048
04:08:22,370 --> 04:08:23,550
You're doing great

10049
04:08:28,290 --> 04:08:29,390
Don't spit it back out!

10050
04:08:29,390 --> 04:08:31,590
You can do it

10051
04:08:33,660 --> 04:08:34,860
You can do it!

10052
04:08:35,360 --> 04:08:37,900
Don't spill it, c'mon, Hosei!!

10053
04:08:37,920 --> 04:08:40,250
Stop! Stop!

10054
04:08:38,970 --> 04:08:41,600
Bleurgh

10055
04:08:43,540 --> 04:08:45,840
Bleurgh

10056
04:08:46,610 --> 04:08:49,560
It's an impossible task

10057
04:08:50,280 --> 04:08:51,880
Just how much water does it hold?

10058
04:08:56,550 --> 04:08:59,490
Hosei, wait just a sec

10059
04:08:57,340 --> 04:08:58,350
It got all over his face...

10060
04:08:58,170 --> 04:08:59,490
He's all soaked through though

10061
04:08:59,490 --> 04:09:02,090
The next failure won't be tolerated

10062
04:09:01,440 --> 04:09:02,090
Got it

10063
04:09:02,090 --> 04:09:05,090
Do it in one go!!

10064
04:09:02,840 --> 04:09:04,840
In one go!!

10065
04:09:03,560 --> 04:09:04,010
All right!

10066
04:09:04,010 --> 04:09:04,390
Yes!

10067
04:09:04,390 --> 04:09:05,090
Again!

10068
04:09:14,300 --> 04:09:15,470
All right!!

10069
04:09:15,470 --> 04:09:16,940
I drank it all!! I drank it all!!

10070
04:09:16,940 --> 04:09:18,310
All right!!

10071
04:09:18,310 --> 04:09:20,640
I drank it all!!  I drank it all!!

10072
04:09:21,280 --> 04:09:23,280
What the hell?

10073
04:09:23,700 --> 04:09:25,260
I finished drinking it all!

10074
04:09:24,660 --> 04:09:26,930
What a pathetic man

10075
04:09:27,250 --> 04:09:28,530
All right!

10076
04:09:28,530 --> 04:09:30,050
Hell yeah!!

10077
04:09:30,050 --> 04:09:32,690
The curse is gone!!

10078
04:09:32,790 --> 04:09:34,060
Thank you very much!!

10079
04:09:34,060 --> 04:09:36,860
Hey wait. Wait a sec, I say!!

10080
04:09:36,860 --> 04:09:38,930
What are you gonna do about this?

10081
04:09:38,930 --> 04:09:40,900
This is Holy Water, y'know!!

10082
04:09:40,900 --> 04:09:42,530
What do you think?

10083
04:09:42,550 --> 04:09:45,940
"What do you think?"

10084
04:09:43,750 --> 04:09:45,930
What do you think?

10085
04:09:45,080 --> 04:09:45,940
"What do you think?"

10086
04:09:45,950 --> 04:09:49,600
That was an impossible task. I appreciate your effort

10087
04:09:49,620 --> 04:09:50,770
But I said it had to be in one go, didn't I?

10088
04:09:50,770 --> 04:09:53,780
But I said it had to be in one go, didn't I?

10089
04:09:52,960 --> 04:09:53,780
Burp

10090
04:09:56,340 --> 04:09:56,690
Come back up

10091
04:09:58,950 --> 04:10:00,780
This hasn't changed anything

10092
04:10:00,800 --> 04:10:05,890
To release the curse the Holy Slap is required

10093
04:10:01,690 --> 04:10:02,770
You'll be taking it

10094
04:10:03,860 --> 04:10:04,570
Got it?

10095
04:10:06,650 --> 04:10:08,690
Wait a minute

10096
04:10:07,910 --> 04:10:08,200
What's up?

10097
04:10:10,160 --> 04:10:14,130
He (Tanaka) is the culprit

10098
04:10:11,790 --> 04:10:12,290
That

10099
04:10:12,710 --> 04:10:14,130
Wha-?

10100
04:10:14,950 --> 04:10:16,100
What does he mean "culprit"?

10101
04:10:18,670 --> 04:10:20,870
What is "culprit"
even supposed to mean?

10102
04:10:22,870 --> 04:10:24,540
Hey, you Hipopo descendant! Get over here!!

10103
04:10:24,540 --> 04:10:26,240
Hey, you Hipopo descendant! Get over here!!

10104
04:10:26,330 --> 04:10:27,390
Why is he a Hipopo?

10105
04:10:27,010 --> 04:10:28,410
I'm not a Hipopo

10106
04:10:28,410 --> 04:10:30,780
So, which tribe are you from?

10107
04:10:30,450 --> 04:10:32,110
I don't...

10108
04:10:30,780 --> 04:10:32,610
OH, YOU WON'T TELL US!!

10109
04:10:32,630 --> 04:10:33,410
You won't tell us, because you're a Hipopo!!

10110
04:10:33,410 --> 04:10:34,880
You won't tell us, because you're a Hipopo!!

10111
04:10:35,220 --> 04:10:39,120
I'M GONNA KICK YOU TO DEATH, ASSHOLE!!

10112
04:10:43,390 --> 04:10:45,120
What are you talking about?

10113
04:10:45,190 --> 04:10:46,320
He's not killing anyone!

10114
04:10:48,430 --> 04:10:51,670
What position does he think he's in?

10115
04:10:49,150 --> 04:10:49,770
He looks like one

10116
04:10:50,260 --> 04:10:51,730
But I'm not

10117
04:10:50,930 --> 04:10:52,320
Seriously, what are they talking about

10118
04:10:52,150 --> 04:10:52,560
Hosei

10119
04:10:52,540 --> 04:10:53,280
No, I'm not!

10120
04:10:53,900 --> 04:10:56,000
This planet, this world,



and everyone in it is depending on you!

10121
04:10:56,000 --> 04:10:58,710
This planet, this world,



and everyone in it is depending on you!

10122
04:11:00,840 --> 04:11:02,210
What do you think?

10123
04:11:03,080 --> 04:11:06,980
Each tell wadju...

10124
04:11:08,090 --> 04:11:08,760
What do you think?

10125
04:11:09,930 --> 04:11:13,760
Stop yapping and just get it over with already!

10126
04:11:13,760 --> 04:11:16,020
Each of you tell me what you think!!

10127
04:11:15,850 --> 04:11:17,570
This is so annoying

10128
04:11:17,600 --> 04:11:19,260
I don't understand the question, either

10129
04:11:19,660 --> 04:11:23,700
It really is different this year

10130
04:11:21,950 --> 04:11:22,330
Isn't it?

10131
04:11:22,330 --> 04:11:22,610
Yes

10132
04:11:24,430 --> 04:11:26,130
You're our only hope

10133
04:11:26,390 --> 04:11:28,790
Nn...

10134
04:11:28,790 --> 04:11:29,200
Okay

10135
04:11:29,080 --> 04:11:30,380
Nnn...

10136
04:11:40,140 --> 04:11:40,920
Right

10137
04:11:45,120 --> 04:11:48,720
Because he's a hero!!

10138
04:11:46,480 --> 04:11:47,150
This time at least

10139
04:11:47,090 --> 04:11:48,020
Not very heroic, though

10140
04:11:47,430 --> 04:11:48,340
He's a hero!

10141
04:11:48,960 --> 04:11:49,370
Let's go

10142
04:11:49,390 --> 04:11:52,690
Nn...

10143
04:11:52,450 --> 04:11:52,810
Hey!

10144
04:11:52,990 --> 04:11:53,350
Yes

10145
04:11:53,600 --> 04:11:54,800
Now, I will expel the curse!

10146
04:11:54,350 --> 04:11:54,710
Yes

10147
04:11:54,800 --> 04:11:56,460
Now, I will expel the curse!

10148
04:11:56,460 --> 04:11:58,460
Now, I will expel the curse!

10149
04:11:57,430 --> 04:11:58,520
yeah- okay

10150
04:11:57,590 --> 04:11:58,040
Okay?

10151
04:11:58,670 --> 04:12:04,270
Finally the moment of the Holy Slap

10152
04:11:58,930 --> 04:11:59,500
Let's go!

10153
04:12:00,360 --> 04:12:01,060
Drive it out!

10154
04:12:01,760 --> 04:12:02,430
The curse!

10155
04:12:04,700 --> 04:12:05,470
One

10156
04:12:06,480 --> 04:12:07,080
Two

10157
04:12:07,640 --> 04:12:09,640
SLAP

10158
04:12:07,920 --> 04:12:08,410
Three!

10159
04:12:09,690 --> 04:12:11,690
SLAP

10160
04:12:09,980 --> 04:12:10,530
Three!

10161
04:12:11,800 --> 04:12:17,920
The curse-expelling Holy Slap explodes!!

10162
04:12:12,550 --> 04:12:14,550
SLAP

10163
04:12:14,650 --> 04:12:16,390
It was good this time

10164
04:12:16,410 --> 04:12:17,860
That was clean

10165
04:12:21,690 --> 04:12:22,190
GODDAMN

10166
04:12:22,190 --> 04:12:25,130
GODDAMN

10167
04:12:26,230 --> 04:12:30,430
That was a good slap~

10168
04:12:30,480 --> 04:12:31,530
He got him good

10169
04:12:32,110 --> 04:12:33,630
What a good slap

10170
04:12:33,780 --> 04:12:34,420
That was good

10171
04:12:38,910 --> 04:12:41,040
This year was a good slap for sure

10172
04:12:40,080 --> 04:12:42,110
It went "smack!"

10173
04:12:42,410 --> 04:12:46,580
That air time was pretty good, too

10174
04:12:44,910 --> 04:12:45,870
That expression, too

10175
04:12:48,350 --> 04:12:49,670
It's a new day

10176
04:12:49,030 --> 04:12:53,090
16 hours since the beginning

10177
04:12:50,250 --> 04:12:52,210
A bothersome incident erupts

10178
04:12:54,450 --> 04:12:55,100
Everyone

10179
04:12:55,370 --> 04:12:56,250
This is important

10180
04:12:56,990 --> 04:12:58,990
They discovered some buried treasure and now


the wild exploration team and the savage pirates are fighting

10181
04:12:58,990 --> 04:13:01,000
They discovered some buried treasure and now


the wild exploration team and the savage pirates are fighting

10182
04:13:01,000 --> 04:13:05,270
They discovered some buried treasure and now


the wild exploration team and the savage pirates are fighting

10183
04:13:05,270 --> 04:13:06,630
The precious archaeological site could be destroyed

10184
04:13:06,630 --> 04:13:08,240
The precious archaeological site could be destroyed

10185
04:13:08,240 --> 04:13:11,440
Could you mediate the situation?

10186
04:13:09,290 --> 04:13:11,440
Alright, let's go!!

10187
04:13:11,610 --> 04:13:18,580
After discovering buried treasure

10188
04:13:11,620 --> 04:13:18,580
the pirates and exploration team have created an explosive situation

10189
04:13:13,100 --> 04:13:13,950
We're going

10190
04:13:14,830 --> 04:13:15,760
I don't really...

10191
04:13:15,620 --> 04:13:16,620
He really wants to, huh?

10192
04:13:17,030 --> 04:13:18,610
He really wants to

10193
04:13:19,760 --> 04:13:28,520
The 5 get on the bus, hurrying to the scene

10194
04:13:25,750 --> 04:13:26,990
Ow ow ow ow

10195
04:13:29,320 --> 04:13:36,000
Even on the bus, Matsumoto's worries continue to brew...

10196
04:13:36,950 --> 04:13:41,100
Are you really that worried?

10197
04:13:39,330 --> 04:13:41,100
I AM worried!!

10198
04:13:41,600 --> 04:13:43,270
When we get there, do you think we'll even be able to do anything?

10199
04:13:43,270 --> 04:13:47,110
When we get there, do you think we'll even be able to do anything?

10200
04:13:44,440 --> 04:13:46,410
What are you saying, we don't have any other choice!

10201
04:13:47,110 --> 04:13:48,610
If we can somehow negotiate with them, we can't pass up that opportunity

10202
04:13:48,610 --> 04:13:50,610
If we can somehow negotiate with them, we can't pass up that opportunity

10203
04:13:50,930 --> 04:13:53,310
What are you thinking?

10204
04:13:53,330 --> 04:13:54,750
What are you thinking? Seriously...

10205
04:13:54,750 --> 04:13:56,220
What are you thinking? Seriously...

10206
04:13:58,150 --> 04:14:00,560
What are you thinking?

10207
04:14:02,540 --> 04:14:05,460
Seriously, what are you thinking??

10208
04:14:06,180 --> 04:14:09,200
Seriously...

10209
04:14:09,200 --> 04:14:09,810
Seriously, what are you thinking?

10210
04:14:09,800 --> 04:14:12,830
Seriously, what are you thinking?

10211
04:14:13,700 --> 04:14:16,200
Seriously, what are you thinking?

10212
04:14:16,200 --> 04:14:21,290
Seriously!!

10213
04:14:17,740 --> 04:14:21,290
What are you thinking

10214
04:14:22,340 --> 04:14:25,210
Since they were in transit, there was no punishment

10215
04:14:25,710 --> 04:14:27,080
That was an incredible waste of effort

10216
04:14:27,080 --> 04:14:30,820
That was an incredible waste of effort

10217
04:14:31,440 --> 04:14:37,390

Looks rough

10343
04:18:19,110 --> 04:18:21,080

10346
04:18:23,650 --> 04:18:25,390
He hasn't moved at all from there!!

10347
04:18:25,500 --> 04:18:26,390
For real

10348
04:18:26,820 --> 04:18:28,460
He isn't moving at all

10349
04:18:28,460 --> 04:18:31,230
What is he doing?

10350
04:18:30,450 --> 04:18:32,870
You can do it!

10351
04:18:33,040 --> 04:18:33,930
Okay, let's go

10352
04:18:33,860 --> 04:18:36,960
Komoto with a leg cramp

10353
04:18:38,350 --> 04:18:39,290
Get a goal!

10354
04:18:39,990 --> 04:18:40,870
You can do it!

10355
04:18:41,370 --> 04:18:42,440
Iwao has a chance

10356
04:18:42,440 --> 04:18:44,440
Iwao has a chance

10357
04:18:43,890 --> 04:18:45,110
owowowowowow

10358
04:18:44,570 --> 04:18:45,790
Iwao has a chance!

10359
04:18:46,150 --> 04:18:47,260
He does

10360
04:18:47,120 --> 04:18:48,300
One on one!

10361
04:18:52,340 --> 04:18:54,750
What the hell...

10362
04:18:58,850 --> 04:19:00,090
That was a good fight!

10363
04:19:01,960 --> 04:19:03,120
This battle ends in a draw, it seems

10364
04:19:03,120 --> 04:19:06,390
This battle ends in a draw, it seems

10365
04:19:05,280 --> 04:19:06,550
NICE FIGHT NICE FIGHT

10366
04:19:07,130 --> 04:19:10,530
That was no good

10367
04:19:08,710 --> 04:19:10,830
Jun-chan has really gotten himself in quite the situation

10368
04:19:17,070 --> 04:19:19,040
It still hasn't stopped at all!

10369
04:19:19,040 --> 04:19:23,010
What is happening to him?

10370
04:19:24,760 --> 04:19:25,950
He's cramped up

10371
04:19:25,490 --> 04:19:26,890
It's a cramp

10372
04:19:28,980 --> 04:19:29,940
He's even good when he's cramping

10373
04:19:30,170 --> 04:19:35,560
Aquarium-Head Challenge

10374
04:19:30,890 --> 04:19:35,020
Next, the one taking on the aquarium-head challenge

10375
04:19:35,560 --> 04:19:37,160
Hey, new guy!

10376
04:19:37,160 --> 04:19:38,430
Yup!!

10377
04:19:39,030 --> 04:19:41,230
Our new guy is buff, huh

10378
04:19:41,230 --> 04:19:44,000
He's always craving high quality protein

10379
04:19:44,200 --> 04:19:45,970
With an aquarium on his head-

10380
04:19:44,250 --> 04:19:52,070
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

10381
04:19:44,250 --> 04:19:52,070
Ueshima Squad's Pride

10382
04:19:44,250 --> 04:19:52,070
With his head in an aquarium, he'll eat all of the raw eggs

10383
04:19:46,160 --> 04:19:49,070
If we drop in raw eggs, he'll eat it all up

10384
04:19:49,350 --> 04:19:51,390
There's no way!!

10385
04:19:51,170 --> 04:19:52,060
No way

10386
04:19:52,070 --> 04:19:53,110
Can you?

10387
04:19:53,110 --> 04:19:54,010
Yeah

10388
04:19:54,030 --> 04:19:55,280
You can, huh

10389
04:19:56,090 --> 04:19:57,010
Why though?

10390
04:19:57,010 --> 04:19:59,450
Why isn't the new guy saying anything?

10391
04:19:57,730 --> 04:19:59,450
Why?

10392
04:20:00,600 --> 04:20:01,780
You ready, new guy?

10393
04:20:01,780 --> 04:20:03,520
Let's go!

10394
04:20:02,580 --> 04:20:03,520
How about it, new guy?

10395
04:20:03,520 --> 04:20:05,350
You want some protein?

10396
04:20:05,350 --> 04:20:06,990
He's scared of it!

10397
04:20:07,070 --> 04:20:09,360
They're putting in eggs?

10398
04:20:09,470 --> 04:20:16,260
① Add water up to the mouth and take a breath

10399
04:20:09,480 --> 04:20:20,700
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

10400
04:20:12,990 --> 04:20:14,230
They stopped quickly, huh

10401
04:20:13,940 --> 04:20:15,980
Once he takes a breath we'll finish filling it

10402
04:20:14,910 --> 04:20:17,920
Don't chicken out!

10403
04:20:16,280 --> 04:20:20,700
② Add the rest of the water, and then a raw egg

10404
04:20:18,270 --> 04:20:19,720
Ready, set

10405
04:20:19,720 --> 04:20:22,100
Eat all 5 eggs, now

10406
04:20:33,750 --> 04:20:37,020
Eat it! Eat it, asshole!

10407
04:20:37,020 --> 04:20:38,390
It'd be great if he got it

10408
04:20:38,650 --> 04:20:39,690
Eat it!

10409
04:20:40,860 --> 04:20:42,070
Oh no

10410
04:20:53,230 --> 04:20:55,740
He lost it

10411
04:20:58,670 --> 04:21:01,540
He got it in

10412
04:20:58,670 --> 04:21:01,540
He got one, though~

10413
04:21:02,230 --> 04:21:03,760
Great stuff

10414
04:21:03,390 --> 04:21:04,360
Alright

10415
04:21:03,980 --> 04:21:05,310
How about that

10416
04:21:05,310 --> 04:21:06,480
It's about time for this year's first look!!

10417
04:21:06,480 --> 04:21:08,920
It's about time for this year's first look!!

10418
04:21:08,920 --> 04:21:09,700
What's that?

10419
04:21:09,670 --> 04:21:11,020
Bring it out!!

10420
04:21:11,340 --> 04:21:12,470
What is it?

10421
04:21:12,600 --> 04:21:13,620
The hell is that?

10422
04:21:13,820 --> 04:21:14,520
Wow~ That's a huge contraption

10423
04:21:14,520 --> 04:21:17,390
Wow~ That's a huge contraption

10424
04:21:17,390 --> 04:21:19,960
Something amazing came out

10425
04:21:19,210 --> 04:21:21,100
How do you react?

10426
04:21:20,610 --> 04:21:25,800
Costing 2,000,000 yen


--------                Human Centrifuge Machine

T/N: 2,000,000 yen is roughly $18,536.

10428

By jet power, a great deal of rotational speed is produced

10430
04:21:34,280 --> 04:21:43,020
Degawa Squad

10431
04:21:34,280 --> 04:21:43,020
Komiya Hironobu

04:21:34,390 --> 04:21:43,020
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

10433
04:21:34,410 --> 04:21:43,020
Degawa Squad's  Pride---------

10434
04:21:34,430 --> 04:21:43,020
He'll eat an entire bowl of piping hot New Years soba while it gyrates

10435
04:21:45,600 --> 04:21:50,160
The five view from special seats

10436
04:21:50,730 --> 04:21:53,430
Komiya's preparations are complete!!

10437
04:21:53,430 --> 04:21:54,860
Piping hot New Years soba coming right up!

10438
04:21:54,870 --> 04:21:57,530
Piping hot New Years soba coming right up!

10439
04:21:55,760 --> 04:21:56,750
Wait

10440
04:21:55,760 --> 04:21:57,300
Let's do it!

10441
04:21:56,750 --> 04:21:57,930
Hang on

10442
04:21:57,930 --> 04:21:58,930
Wait a second

10443
04:21:58,930 --> 04:22:01,040
You got this?

10444
04:21:59,540 --> 04:22:01,040
Let's do it!!

10445
04:22:01,040 --> 04:22:02,970
How will it rotate?

10446
04:22:02,170 --> 04:22:02,970
Alright!

10447
04:22:02,970 --> 04:22:04,020
Hell yeah!

10448
04:22:18,950 --> 04:22:21,110
There's no way I'd do this

10449
04:22:22,860 --> 04:22:24,960
This is insane

10450
04:22:24,020 --> 04:22:24,960
Is this okay?

10451
04:22:25,380 --> 04:22:26,730
IZ HOT

10452
04:22:26,750 --> 04:22:28,260
IZ HOT

10453
04:22:27,380 --> 04:22:28,260
IZ HOT

10454
04:22:28,280 --> 04:22:30,500
IZ HOT

10455
04:22:29,380 --> 04:22:30,500
IZ HOT

10456
04:22:30,500 --> 04:22:32,430
"Iz hot"?

10457
04:22:32,430 --> 04:22:34,500
He's actually eating it!

10458
04:22:33,480 --> 04:22:34,500
He's pretty good, right?

10459
04:22:34,720 --> 04:22:35,550
Wait

10460
04:22:35,550 --> 04:22:36,540
Is he eating it all?

10461
04:22:36,540 --> 04:22:38,570
IT'S HOT!!

10462
04:22:38,760 --> 04:22:41,580
Stop~

10463
04:22:45,080 --> 04:22:46,200
Very nice

10464
04:22:46,210 --> 04:22:47,920
That's was scary

10465
04:22:49,280 --> 04:22:51,290
You really did it

10466
04:22:52,150 --> 04:22:53,860
Great job Komiya

10467
04:22:53,860 --> 04:22:56,700
Amazing...

10468
04:22:56,720 --> 04:23:02,230
Abareru-kun

10469
04:22:56,720 --> 04:23:02,230
Ueshima Squad

10470
04:22:57,060 --> 04:23:02,230
While spinning, he'll eat an entire pot of New Years soba

10471
04:22:57,580 --> 04:23:02,230
As for Ueshima Squad, Abareru-kun is up next to challenge the soba

10472
04:23:02,230 --> 04:23:03,170
Let's go!!  Abareru!!

10473
04:23:03,170 --> 04:23:04,430
Let's go!!  Abareru!!

10474
04:23:04,450 --> 04:23:05,300
Yeah!

10475
04:23:10,960 --> 04:23:13,640
It's because they tilt

10476
04:23:15,580 --> 04:23:17,910
Wow that's fast

10477
04:23:18,450 --> 04:23:20,160
Hang in there a little longer!

10478
04:23:22,320 --> 04:23:23,920
He's eating

10479
04:23:34,760 --> 04:23:37,530
Superb!

10480
04:23:36,280 --> 04:23:37,530
I don't get it at all

10481
04:23:40,840 --> 04:23:42,540
That was good, Abareru!

10482
04:23:44,370 --> 04:23:47,110
Alright, we win!!

10483
04:23:48,040 --> 04:23:50,280
Your damn grumbling is getting on my nerves

10484
04:23:50,280 --> 04:23:53,080
So let's end it with this

10485
04:23:51,900 --> 04:23:53,080
Let's do it

10486
04:23:51,900 --> 04:23:53,080
With what?

10487
04:23:53,100 --> 04:23:54,120
Bring it out!!

10488
04:23:54,120 --> 04:23:55,300
Let's go

10489
04:23:55,300 --> 04:23:57,590
Huh, what's this?

10490
04:23:57,820 --> 04:24:00,490
Huh?

10491
04:23:58,950 --> 04:24:00,490
It changed?

10492
04:23:59,640 --> 04:24:01,390
It's back

10493
04:24:01,390 --> 04:24:03,760
This year, though our final showdown has arrived- But before that

10494
04:24:03,760 --> 04:24:05,060
This year, though our final showdown has arrived- But before that

10495
04:24:05,060 --> 04:24:07,510
The tragedy of 2017- do you all remember it?

10496
04:24:07,500 --> 04:24:10,100
The tragedy of 2017- do you all remember it?

10497
04:24:08,400 --> 04:24:10,100
What was that?

10498
04:24:10,100 --> 04:24:12,070
Both leaders

10499
04:24:12,070 --> 04:24:14,970
Were supposed to blow air up their asses and arm wrestle

10500
04:24:16,320 --> 04:24:21,440
The first one to fart lost

10501
04:24:21,710 --> 04:24:23,810
You seriously need to quit that

10502
04:24:28,650 --> 04:24:34,160
That showdown to not fart first was

10503
04:24:31,150 --> 04:24:32,890
ultimately canceled because of reasons!!

10504
04:24:32,890 --> 04:24:34,160
ultimately canceled because of reasons!!

10505
04:24:34,590 --> 04:24:36,630
Shit

10506
04:24:36,630 --> 04:24:38,360
Relax

10507
04:24:37,780 --> 04:24:38,360
What?

10508
04:24:38,360 --> 04:24:41,430
A new contest was created!!

10509
04:24:40,660 --> 04:24:41,430
Oh?

10510
04:24:41,430 --> 04:24:47,670
It's called

10511
04:24:42,780 --> 04:24:47,670

10512
04:24:42,780 --> 04:24:47,670

10513
04:24:50,220 --> 04:24:50,450

Ueshima Ryuhei

Degawa Tetsuro

10518
04:24:55,280 --> 04:24:57,050
I'm gonna tear your balls off!

10519
04:24:57,050 --> 04:24:58,580
That's my line, asshole

10520
04:24:58,580 --> 04:25:00,920
My balls are the one thing I know I can trust

10521
04:25:00,430 --> 04:25:02,780
This is the finale

10522
04:25:02,780 --> 04:25:04,020
Let's go!

10523
04:25:04,120 --> 04:25:10,190
-----------------------------------------------------------------------|
-----------------------------------------------------------------------|

10524
04:25:04,180 --> 04:25:10,190
The clothespins are snapped
onto the balls for tug of war

10525
04:25:05,320 --> 04:25:06,350
Bring out the balls

10526
04:25:06,340 --> 04:25:07,190
Is this okay?

10527
04:25:11,140 --> 04:25:13,260
What are they showing us?

10528
04:25:13,260 --> 04:25:14,960
What's wrong, Koumoto?

10529
04:25:14,960 --> 04:25:16,470
It's so stiff...

10530
04:25:16,470 --> 04:25:17,700
Leaders-

10531
04:25:18,870 --> 04:25:20,100
The balls are so receded it's like nothing's there

10532
04:25:20,100 --> 04:25:21,970
The balls are so receded it's like nothing's there

10533
04:25:22,300 --> 04:25:29,280
Difficulty clipping to the testicles

10534
04:25:26,070 --> 04:25:29,280
I can't get it on, it's so tight

10535
04:25:30,510 --> 04:25:32,310
There's no loose skin

10536
04:25:35,150 --> 04:25:36,080
Hey!

10537
04:25:36,080 --> 04:25:37,890
Do you have warm water or something?

10538
04:25:37,890 --> 04:25:39,520
The hell do you mean, warm water?

10539
04:25:39,520 --> 04:25:41,560
To soften it up!

10540
04:25:41,890 --> 04:25:46,360
Hot water is prepared quickly

10541
04:25:43,860 --> 04:25:45,440
Sorry, excuse me

10542
04:25:45,440 --> 04:25:46,360
Loosen up

10543
04:25:46,860 --> 04:25:48,360
Excuse me, excuse me

10544
04:25:51,050 --> 04:25:52,630
HOT!!

10545
04:25:59,740 --> 04:26:02,780
This is still before the showdown has even started, too!

10546
04:26:04,210 --> 04:26:06,720
Hurry it up

10547
04:26:05,480 --> 04:26:06,720
Shut the hell up!!

10548
04:26:06,720 --> 04:26:08,720
I'm loosening up my balls!

10549
04:26:09,080 --> 04:26:09,930
Why?

10550
04:26:09,930 --> 04:26:10,820
Hurry up!

10551
04:26:13,440 --> 04:26:15,160
Okay...

10552
04:26:25,030 --> 04:26:25,870
Let's go

10553
04:26:25,870 --> 04:26:28,200
Let's go, I'm good!!

10554
04:26:28,200 --> 04:26:28,750
You got this!

10555
04:26:28,750 --> 04:26:29,570
Yeah

10556
04:26:30,100 --> 04:26:30,820
Alright!

10557
04:26:31,010 --> 04:26:33,410
I got it on there good!

10558
04:26:33,410 --> 04:26:34,310
Hurry up!

10559
04:26:34,310 --> 04:26:36,610
Hurry up, our leader's already attached!

10560
04:26:36,910 --> 04:26:38,630
I'm already hooked up!

10561
04:26:36,910 --> 04:26:42,280
Both sacks attached and ready

10562
04:26:46,670 --> 04:26:47,820
BRING IT

10563
04:26:48,390 --> 04:26:49,990
Ow ow ow ow ow ow

10564
04:26:49,990 --> 04:26:52,260
Wait a second! Ow ow ow

10565
04:26:52,260 --> 04:26:55,730
Come over here, you bitch!

10566
04:26:56,430 --> 04:26:57,930
Oooooooooooooooooh

10567
04:27:03,570 --> 04:27:05,410
Bring it out!!

10568
04:27:05,260 --> 04:27:06,060
Bring what out?

10569
04:27:06,060 --> 04:27:07,480
There's not enough weight

10570
04:27:07,480 --> 04:27:10,680
Plastic bottles for weight

10571
04:27:11,630 --> 04:27:12,600
Let's go with that

10572
04:27:13,030 --> 04:27:19,220
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|

10573
04:27:13,050 --> 04:27:19,220
The weight is increased for both contestants

10574
04:27:15,220 --> 04:27:17,120
Slowly, do it slowly

10575
04:27:17,670 --> 04:27:19,220
Slowly?

10576
04:27:18,570 --> 04:27:19,220
Yes

10577
04:27:21,210 --> 04:27:21,320
Uwaaaaa!!

10578
04:27:21,210 --> 04:27:21,320
Uwaaaaa!!

10579
04:27:21,310 --> 04:27:23,290

10581

1:30 in the morning - while their next job is being prepared, the five are on standby in their room

10582
04:27:39,220 --> 04:27:43,410

10583
04:27:46,730 --> 04:27:48,920
Aaaaaaah

10584
04:27:52,690 --> 04:27:57,460
Hey, Endo, why don't you sing a little for us?

10585
04:27:55,220 --> 04:27:57,010
Sing?

10586
04:27:57,830 --> 04:27:59,760
What kind of song should I sing?

10587
04:27:59,760 --> 04:28:02,500
Honestly, anything is fine

Scary

10925
04:29:26,630 --> 04:29:27,200
Scary

10926
04:29:27,200 --> 04:29:27,310
Ow

10927
04:29:27,300 --> 04:29:29,750

Hosei and Endo

10942
04:29:30,620 --> 04:29:32,550
They've been taken

10943
04:29:33,890 --> 04:29:35,060
A jacket?

10944
04:29:34,790 --> 04:29:35,660
That spooked me

10945
04:29:35,660 --> 04:29:38,260
Oh wait... Are we supposed to wear this?

10946
04:29:36,360 --> 04:29:40,260
Jackets and towels on the desks

10947
04:29:38,260 --> 04:29:40,260
What's with the towel?

10948
04:29:40,410 --> 04:29:44,400
Meanwhile, Hosei and Endo...

10949
04:29:40,910 --> 04:29:44,400
Meanwhile, the vanishing Hosei and Endo

10950
04:29:44,400 --> 04:29:44,770
Hey!

10951
04:29:44,770 --> 04:29:45,070
Hey!

10952
04:29:45,070 --> 04:29:45,430
Hey!

10953
04:29:45,430 --> 04:29:46,070
HEY!

10954
04:29:46,100 --> 04:29:47,300

10955
04:29:47,320 --> 04:29:47,900

10956
04:29:47,900 --> 04:29:49,770
Awww not again...

10957
04:29:49,800 --> 04:29:52,910
Just where are they going...?

10958
04:29:53,550 --> 04:29:56,010
And then

10959
04:30:05,550 --> 04:30:08,250
They sure went out of their way to film this

10960
04:30:08,840 --> 04:30:12,220
Hello hello madam of the apartment complex

10961
04:30:12,220 --> 04:30:15,860
The inside of your mouth has has saliva that is perfect

10962
04:30:15,860 --> 04:30:19,770
Hello hello master of the apartment complex

10963
04:30:17,410 --> 04:30:19,410
There he is

10964
04:30:18,360 --> 04:30:19,410
Indeed

10965
04:30:19,770 --> 04:30:23,670
The bad breath within your mouth is perfect

04:30:23,850 --> 04:30:26,490
T/N: Cookie is from the comedy duo, Yasei Bakudan. He regularly appears in the last segment of the Batsu games with really bizarre dialog and art.

10969
04:30:24,190 --> 04:30:26,490

Wild bomb

10971
04:30:27,320 --> 04:30:32,380
Dear audience

10972
04:30:29,090 --> 04:30:32,380
I hope you are all in high spirits

10973
04:30:32,380 --> 04:30:36,080
My, my

10974
04:30:33,430 --> 04:30:36,080
It has become quite noisy as of late

10975
04:30:35,380 --> 04:30:40,720
As if you were all a child looking for a teat to suckle on

10976
04:30:39,320 --> 04:30:40,720
Those eyes...

10977
04:30:41,200 --> 04:30:46,020
I want it...

10978
04:30:46,160 --> 04:30:47,460
I want iiiiit!!

10979

Garittochuu

10981
04:30:49,710 --> 04:30:52,630
T/N: Garittochuu is a comedy duo with Yoshinari as one of the members.

10982
04:30:52,160 --> 04:30:54,200
That's disgusting

10983
04:30:52,880 --> 04:30:54,210
So,

10984
04:30:54,210 --> 04:30:58,340
My important friends Hosei and Endo-kun

10985
04:30:58,400 --> 04:31:01,970
My minions have taken them away

10986
04:31:03,640 --> 04:31:06,450
You must hurry and save them

10987
04:31:06,460 --> 04:31:09,780
The jeans they've gotten wet

10988
04:31:07,630 --> 04:31:09,780
will become frozen~!

10989
04:31:09,780 --> 04:31:14,790
T/N: "Bun bun" is a Japanese onomatopoeia for buzzing sounds while beating someone up or punching them is "bun-naguri". There really was no way to make sense out of it and it's just a really crappy pun.

10990
04:31:09,780 --> 04:31:14,790
The side of your face goes buzz buzz buzz knockout!

10991
04:31:14,950 --> 04:31:17,560
Hahahahahaha

10992
04:31:17,590 --> 04:31:19,790
What the hell is this?

10993
04:31:20,090 --> 04:31:22,090
So in order to do that

10994
04:31:22,260 --> 04:31:25,900
I think you will have quite the adventure

10995
04:31:24,530 --> 04:31:25,900
looking for the treasure!

10996
04:31:25,900 --> 04:31:28,200
Isn't that right Mr.Bird

10997
04:31:31,150 --> 04:31:33,410
From here on out in the pitch black darkness

10998
04:31:33,410 --> 04:31:37,380
the legendary hidden treasure, "Golden Skull"

10999
04:31:35,640 --> 04:31:37,380
will be what you seek

11000
04:31:37,540 --> 04:31:39,210
After this, from here on out

11001
04:31:39,210 --> 04:31:41,780
you are allowed to laugh, however

11002
04:31:40,480 --> 04:31:41,780
you'll be OUT if you get startled

11003
04:31:41,780 --> 04:31:44,850
Nnn~

11004
04:31:42,400 --> 04:31:44,850
Kiss

11005
04:31:42,950 --> 04:31:44,850
You'll be OUT

11006
04:31:47,250 --> 04:31:48,450
There it is

11007
04:31:48,450 --> 04:31:51,520
Again it's Tanaka

11008
04:31:49,950 --> 04:31:51,520
I'll be more careful this time

11009
04:31:51,520 --> 04:31:55,890
Could you not swing your elbow at our face like you usually do?

11010
04:31:53,470 --> 04:31:55,890
Yeah, the "uwaah" and then "bang"

11011
04:31:55,890 --> 04:31:59,730
Dark blood just spilling out of our noses

11012
04:31:59,730 --> 04:32:00,870
Absolutely not

11013
04:32:01,230 --> 04:32:08,110
Special Late Night Rules

11014
04:32:02,370 --> 04:32:08,110

11016

Kidnapped Hosei and Endo are confined to this place

11017
04:32:08,810 --> 04:32:17,580
Currently confined to this place

11018
04:32:13,340 --> 04:32:18,050
I get it, I get it I get it!

11019
04:32:18,050 --> 04:32:21,150
Heeey

11020
04:32:20,250 --> 04:32:21,150
They went again

11021
04:32:21,270 --> 04:32:27,930
In order to save Endo and Hosei they have to find the legendary hidden treasure

11022
04:32:28,130 --> 04:32:31,600
Leaving on a rescue mission

11023
04:32:29,510 --> 04:32:31,600
I have a bad feeling about this

11024
04:32:31,760 --> 04:32:38,900

11026
04:32:35,040 --> 04:32:37,540
Let's work together, alright?

11027
04:32:37,540 --> 04:32:38,900
We're always working together

11028
04:32:39,170 --> 04:32:42,110
If we're not together we're on our own

11029
04:32:40,800 --> 04:32:42,110
No, that's not right

11030
04:32:42,110 --> 04:32:46,240
I often take the lead, don't I?

11031
04:32:44,110 --> 04:32:46,240
It's because you're young

11032
04:32:46,240 --> 04:32:49,230
But still...

11033
04:32:47,230 --> 04:32:49,230
That's completely different

11034
04:32:48,050 --> 04:32:50,650
Woah

11035
04:32:49,280 --> 04:32:50,650
Again...

11036
04:32:50,650 --> 04:32:55,450
Huge

11037
04:32:50,650 --> 04:32:55,450
Present box

11038
04:32:50,760 --> 04:32:53,780
That damn big thing is scary...

11039
04:32:53,780 --> 04:32:55,450
That's a present

11040
04:32:53,780 --> 04:32:55,450
That's a present box, right?

11041
04:32:55,450 --> 04:32:56,450
There are standing spots

11042
04:32:56,450 --> 04:32:57,420
There are standing spots

11043
04:32:58,260 --> 04:33:00,460
Please wait here after lining up

11044
04:33:01,070 --> 04:33:04,760
Wait, why am I in the middle?

11045
04:33:05,710 --> 04:33:07,130
Why?

11046
04:33:08,050 --> 04:33:10,370
Nnya

11047
04:33:08,420 --> 04:33:10,370
Woah!

11048
04:33:08,970 --> 04:33:10,370
The hell?

11049
04:33:10,370 --> 04:33:12,140
It's because he let out a strange sound

11050
04:33:14,970 --> 04:33:18,710
You are humbly offered

11054
04:33:18,710 --> 04:33:21,580
Please open the lid

Tanaka

11056
04:33:22,180 --> 04:33:25,350
Me?

11057
04:33:24,050 --> 04:33:25,350
It's fine

11058
04:33:25,350 --> 04:33:28,120
Let's open it all together

11059
04:33:26,420 --> 04:33:28,120
If Matsumoto gives me a hand, then sure

11060
04:33:28,270 --> 04:33:31,560
But I have stiff shoulders

11061
04:33:29,590 --> 04:33:31,560
You can still open this though, right?

11062
04:33:31,960 --> 04:33:33,260
How do we do it?

11063
04:33:32,770 --> 04:33:35,190
Like this

11064
04:33:33,260 --> 04:33:35,190
Like this

11065
04:33:33,720 --> 04:33:35,190
Just do it in one move?

11066
04:33:39,130 --> 04:33:43,840
Something was ejected from the box

11067
04:33:41,400 --> 04:33:43,840
Stop doing that

11068
04:33:42,430 --> 04:33:43,840
Oh man...

11069
04:33:44,170 --> 04:33:45,840
Stop that

11070
04:33:44,420 --> 04:33:46,900
Damnit, Tanaka

11071
04:33:45,840 --> 04:33:46,910

11076
04:33:51,090 --> 04:33:52,860
What is this?

11077
04:33:51,090 --> 04:33:56,750
Present from Cookie

11078
04:33:51,980 --> 04:34:05,320
These are the bangs from the former

That's what it is

This part here

11084
04:34:04,190 --> 04:34:05,340
Is that so?

11085
04:34:05,340 --> 04:34:07,690
His parents manage a tonkatsu restaurant huh?

11086
04:34:07,690 --> 04:34:11,300
First time I've heard that

11087
04:34:08,660 --> 04:34:11,300
Same

It's probably a lot easier being captured

11091
04:34:14,550 --> 04:34:16,740
Yeah

11092
04:34:19,370 --> 04:34:22,910
There's a sign saying, "Wait Here"

11093
04:34:23,040 --> 04:34:25,440
This is gonna be scary

11094
04:34:24,010 --> 04:34:25,440
Yeah

11095
04:34:25,440 --> 04:34:32,050
Count down until the prank              seconds left

11096

Over here?

WAAAHHHHHHH

11099

Yeah, look at that!

11100
04:34:35,650 --> 04:34:39,360
Something fell from the ceiling

04:34:39,720 --> 04:34:43,090
Stop doing that!!

11102
04:34:40,720 --> 04:34:44,090
Anyone would startle

11103
04:34:40,990 --> 04:34:43,090
This would startle anyone!

11104
04:34:43,090 --> 04:34:47,170
A half-used tube?

11105
04:34:43,340 --> 04:34:46,850
That's weird!

11106
04:34:44,010 --> 04:34:47,900
It came from above, I don't understand this

11107
04:34:46,850 --> 04:34:50,100
I didn't know what it was, so I got startled!

11108
04:34:47,900 --> 04:34:51,240
Wouldn't you be startled

11109
04:34:49,170 --> 04:34:51,240
by something unknown!

11110
04:34:50,550 --> 04:34:52,570
What is it?

11111
04:34:51,240 --> 04:34:52,570
What is this?

11112
04:34:52,570 --> 04:35:00,650
Present from Cookie

11113
04:34:52,600 --> 04:35:00,650
This is the leftover hair gel used by

11114
04:34:55,020 --> 04:35:00,650
Kawai Shunichi,

11115
04:34:56,910 --> 04:35:00,650
whose parents manage a tonkatsu restaurant

11116
04:35:00,030 --> 04:35:00,760
Amazing

11117
04:35:00,760 --> 04:35:02,750
Amazing, isn't it?

11118
04:35:03,450 --> 04:35:04,680
WHAT!?

11119
04:35:04,680 --> 04:35:09,290
A group of men with painted faces attack Tanaka

11120
04:35:04,900 --> 04:35:06,580
What!?

11121
04:35:08,170 --> 04:35:09,290
Save me...

11122
04:35:09,290 --> 04:35:11,060
WHAT!?

11123
04:35:11,060 --> 04:35:11,690
EH?

11124
04:35:11,690 --> 04:35:12,750
What? Wait a second

11125
04:35:13,010 --> 04:35:14,330
What are you doing!?

11126
04:35:14,330 --> 04:35:15,660
Cold cold cold

11127
04:35:16,430 --> 04:35:18,800
No one should be startled like that

11128
04:35:19,180 --> 04:35:21,280
Something like that...

11129
04:35:21,280 --> 04:35:22,570
He got pushed away

11130
04:35:22,570 --> 04:35:24,370
What's that?

11131
04:35:25,050 --> 04:35:29,270
It is the finished image of Kawai Shunichi

11132
04:35:29,840 --> 04:35:32,640
You've been given bangs

11133
04:35:29,840 --> 04:35:32,640
I've been given bangs

11134
04:35:32,640 --> 04:35:39,980
The remainder of the gel was used to complete Kawai Shunichi's hair

11135
04:35:32,880 --> 04:35:36,710
Now that I think about it, you always get these kinds of treatments

11136
04:35:35,400 --> 04:35:39,980
Yes, I do, I do, it's so surpising

11137
04:35:36,700 --> 04:35:39,980
That's right, so violent

11138
04:35:39,990 --> 04:35:46,120
Confinement Room

11139
04:35:39,990 --> 04:35:46,120
m 0 0 l 0 -55 l 230 -55 l 230 0 l 0 0

11140
04:35:40,250 --> 04:35:46,120
These two are anxious about something

11141
04:35:46,390 --> 04:35:49,860
Downtown are 55 years old

11142
04:35:48,840 --> 04:35:49,860
Yeah

11143
04:35:49,860 --> 04:35:52,560
When you look at Hamada-san from the side...

11144
04:35:52,600 --> 04:35:58,240
The dented area of his eyes really shows his age...

11145
04:35:58,800 --> 04:36:01,910
When he is really tired

11146
04:36:01,910 --> 04:36:05,740
His eyelids make him look 5 times older...

11147
04:36:06,110 --> 04:36:08,710
That means he is human after all

11148
04:36:07,730 --> 04:36:08,710
Seems so

11149
04:36:08,710 --> 04:36:14,150
He needs to accept that and connect with the next generation

11150
04:36:14,270 --> 04:36:17,020
What's up with this?

11151
04:36:14,670 --> 04:36:17,020
Ahh...

11152
04:36:17,190 --> 04:36:21,030
Floor Entrance

11153
04:36:17,190 --> 04:36:21,030
m 0 0 l 0 -55 l 170 -55 l 170 0 l 0 0

11154
04:36:17,650 --> 04:36:19,970
They really have it easy

11155
04:36:18,460 --> 04:36:21,030
Is this the pattern of going outdoors?

11156
04:36:19,270 --> 04:36:21,030
Wow, it does seem like the outdoors pattern

11157
04:36:24,190 --> 04:36:25,400
Wait, what are you doing?

11158
04:36:25,400 --> 04:36:30,600
Tanaka making the two seniors go forward as shields

11159
04:36:26,730 --> 04:36:30,600
What are you doing, pushing us?

11160
04:36:30,830 --> 04:36:32,400
Scary

11161
04:36:31,700 --> 04:36:32,400
Creepy

11162
04:36:32,400 --> 04:36:35,270
I just got startled by the Heipo statue

11163
04:36:36,240 --> 04:36:40,380
Well, we---

11164
04:36:36,420 --> 04:36:38,840
Woah

11165
04:36:36,830 --> 04:36:38,840
Woah

11166
04:36:40,730 --> 04:36:42,450
What?? What???

11167
04:36:42,430 --> 04:36:44,420
That was sudden

11168
04:36:42,450 --> 04:36:47,120
A voice is heard coming from the truck

11169
04:36:43,230 --> 04:36:44,420
That's right

11170
04:36:43,960 --> 04:36:45,600
Save me

11171
04:36:45,600 --> 04:36:47,130
Save me

11172
04:36:47,140 --> 04:36:49,490
Save me~

11173
04:36:48,040 --> 04:36:49,490
Wait

11174
04:36:49,490 --> 04:36:51,720
It's Heipo-san, right?

11175
04:36:50,050 --> 04:36:51,720
Save me

11176
04:36:51,100 --> 04:36:51,720
What

11177
04:36:51,100 --> 04:36:51,720
Woah

11178
04:36:51,770 --> 04:36:56,930
wrapped in a mat
made of reeds

11179
04:36:51,770 --> 04:36:56,930
Heipo

11180
04:36:52,360 --> 04:36:54,030
Help me, quick!

11181
04:36:52,690 --> 04:36:54,030
Heipo-san!

11182
04:36:54,030 --> 04:36:55,480
What's wrong, Heipo?

11183
04:36:54,790 --> 04:36:55,480
Please

11184
04:36:55,480 --> 04:36:57,190
Please release me quickly

11185
04:36:57,190 --> 04:36:58,330
Let's get him out

11186
04:36:57,460 --> 04:36:58,330
That's right

11187
04:36:58,330 --> 04:36:59,160
Heipo!!

11188
04:36:59,160 --> 04:37:01,170
I'm scared, please save me

11189
04:36:59,980 --> 04:37:01,170
What's up with this

11190
04:37:01,170 --> 04:37:04,820
Ha Ha Ha Hawoaaahh

11191
04:37:04,450 --> 04:37:05,740
Alright alright

11192
04:37:05,740 --> 04:37:06,770
What happened?

11193
04:37:06,770 --> 04:37:10,680
I was wrapped up

11194
04:37:08,040 --> 04:37:10,680
Wrapped up?

11195
04:37:09,510 --> 04:37:10,680
Wrapped up, right?

11196
04:37:10,680 --> 04:37:15,430
Rescuing wrapped up Heipo

11197
04:37:12,760 --> 04:37:15,650
It's good that it's Heipo though

11198
04:37:15,650 --> 04:37:16,410
Yeah

11199
04:37:16,410 --> 04:37:18,150
Ehh what do I do now!?

11200
04:37:18,250 --> 04:37:25,920
Riding in a truck with Heipo in bad weather

11201
04:37:26,110 --> 04:37:34,570
Pursuing the hidden treasure with rigorous commitment

11202
04:37:27,150 --> 04:37:30,540
After adding an easily scared man to the team,

11203
04:37:30,530 --> 04:37:34,570
they commit to pursuing the hidden treasure

11204
04:37:34,920 --> 04:37:35,160
Aaahhhhhhh

11205
04:37:35,160 --> 04:37:36,450
Aaahhhhhhh

11206
04:37:36,530 --> 04:37:37,970
It's just shaking

11207
04:37:37,970 --> 04:37:40,540
It is a car after all

11208
04:37:40,290 --> 04:37:40,870
No!

11209
04:37:40,870 --> 04:37:45,010
There is no such thing

11210
04:37:43,170 --> 04:37:45,010
But... There is, isn't there?

11211
04:37:45,780 --> 04:37:48,350
Heipo and Tanaka together is...

11212
04:37:46,530 --> 04:37:48,350
Yeah, just give us a break

11213
04:37:48,350 --> 04:37:52,780
I hate being sandwiched between these two

11214
04:37:50,300 --> 04:37:52,780
I get that

11215
04:37:50,300 --> 04:37:52,780
I'm scared!

11216
04:37:53,280 --> 04:37:57,020
The truck arrives at its destination

11217
04:37:55,750 --> 04:37:57,020
We're here

11218
04:37:58,160 --> 04:37:59,860
We arrived

11219
04:37:58,970 --> 04:37:59,860
The car stopped

11220
04:37:58,970 --> 04:37:59,860
We stopped

11221
04:37:59,860 --> 04:38:04,830
When I was getting wrapped up they said, "Show them this"

11222
04:38:02,360 --> 04:38:04,830
You should've said that sooner

11223
04:38:03,160 --> 04:38:04,830
What the hell

11224
04:38:04,860 --> 04:38:07,800
The contents of the letter are...

11225
04:38:07,980 --> 04:38:19,080
The four of you have to go to the shrine that is further ahead in darkness.
Attain the Gold Skull and the stone slabs that lead the way

11226
04:38:07,980 --> 04:38:19,080
m 0 0 l 0 140 l 1120 140 l 1120 0 l 0 0

11227
04:38:15,560 --> 04:38:17,680
Stone slab?

11228
04:38:19,780 --> 04:38:20,980
Get the stone

11229
04:38:20,440 --> 04:38:20,980
Let's go then

11230
04:38:20,980 --> 04:38:23,180
Could the three of you go please?

11231
04:38:22,210 --> 04:38:23,180
Why

11232
04:38:23,180 --> 04:38:26,890
Are you fine with being here all by yourself?

11233
04:38:24,520 --> 04:38:26,890
Scary, that's scary

11234
04:38:27,080 --> 04:38:33,590
Emergency

11235
04:38:27,720 --> 04:38:33,590
Find the stone slab that will lead to the hidden treasure!!

11236
04:38:27,720 --> 04:38:33,590
Four of them aim for the shrine

11237
04:38:33,790 --> 04:38:45,870
Destination

11238
04:38:33,790 --> 04:38:45,870
Truck

11239
04:38:33,790 --> 04:38:45,870
m 0 0 l 0 -85 l 250 -85 l 250 0 l 0 0

11240
04:38:33,790 --> 04:38:45,870
m 0 0 l 0 -85 l 330-85 l 330 0 l 0 0

11241
04:38:34,890 --> 04:38:43,020
From the truck's location to the shrine it's about 300 meters which is about a 10 minute walk

11242
04:38:39,360 --> 04:38:45,870
is about a 10 minute walk

11243
04:38:39,360 --> 04:38:45,870
From the truck to the shrine

11244
04:38:43,020 --> 04:38:45,870
However, during the walk...

11245
04:38:46,170 --> 04:38:49,810
Pitch black darkness

11246
04:38:52,930 --> 04:38:53,750
Ow, ouch!

11247
04:38:53,930 --> 04:39:02,720
From here on out four of them are equipped with a camera that can film even in the dark

11248
04:39:02,900 --> 04:39:08,530
Into the world of darkness

11249
04:39:02,970 --> 04:39:05,110
There's a sense of evil

11250
04:39:09,130 --> 04:39:11,530
[Matsumoto] Heipo, you coming?

11251
04:39:12,600 --> 04:39:14,230
[Heipo] No no no, I don't wanna go

11252
04:39:14,230 --> 04:39:16,900
No no no

11253
04:39:14,460 --> 04:39:21,770
The beginning of the perilous tunnel

11254
04:39:14,880 --> 04:39:16,900
A tunnel?

11255
04:39:15,550 --> 04:39:16,900
It is a tunnel!

11256
04:39:17,170 --> 04:39:18,950
It's definitely impossible

11257
04:39:18,950 --> 04:39:21,770
They said four people, so we have no choice

11258
04:39:22,110 --> 04:39:24,720
[Heipo] Aaaaaaaaaa

11259
04:39:23,920 --> 04:39:26,010
I don't like this

11260
04:39:24,840 --> 04:39:26,010
C'mon Heipo

11261
04:39:26,010 --> 04:39:30,920
It is certainly impossible to do it alone

11262
04:39:26,730 --> 04:39:28,910
This is bad, bad, bad

11263
04:39:28,910 --> 04:39:30,920
[Heipo] This is absolutely impossible

11264
04:39:31,110 --> 04:39:38,060
Because we are shooting with a special camera it looks bright

11265
04:39:31,110 --> 04:39:38,060
m 0 0 l 0 -60 l 1300 -60 l 1300 0 l 0 0

11266
04:39:34,180 --> 04:39:36,690
Oooh, I see!

11267
04:39:38,260 --> 04:39:42,430
Their field of vision

11268
04:39:38,260 --> 04:39:42,430
is almost zero

11269
04:39:40,010 --> 04:39:42,430
I couldn't see anything

11270
04:39:42,430 --> 04:39:45,650
[Hamada] This is horrible

11271
04:39:43,360 --> 04:39:45,650
Stone slab

11272
04:39:44,760 --> 04:39:45,650
Scary

11273
04:39:46,410 --> 04:39:52,840
Empty can prank in          seconds

11274
04:39:48,250 --> 04:39:51,190
This is...?

11275
04:39:48,770 --> 04:39:51,320
This would be scary

11276
04:39:49,170 --> 04:39:51,190
Scary, scary, scary

11277
04:39:50,220 --> 04:39:52,300
Right?

11278
04:39:51,190 --> 04:39:53,200
Why are you so loud?

11279
04:39:51,690 --> 04:39:53,200
Aaahhhhh

11280
04:39:53,200 --> 04:39:54,440
Ahhh!!

11281
04:39:55,940 --> 04:39:58,780
What is it? WHAT IS IT??

11282
04:39:57,080 --> 04:39:58,780
SOMETHING'S THERE

11283
04:39:58,780 --> 04:40:00,750
THERE WAS SOMETHING THERE!!

11284
04:39:59,930 --> 04:40:01,680
What what what

11285
04:40:00,330 --> 04:40:01,680
What?

11286
04:40:01,680 --> 04:40:03,920
Please save me...

11287
04:40:02,080 --> 04:40:03,920
Something grabbed my leg

11288
04:40:03,050 --> 04:40:03,920
Is there someone there?

11289
04:40:04,310 --> 04:40:07,850
I'm scared

11290
04:40:05,280 --> 04:40:07,850
I told you I heard clanking

11291
04:40:06,370 --> 04:40:07,850
Something grabbed me

11292
04:40:07,980 --> 04:40:10,200
I saw it with my own eyes

11293
04:40:08,920 --> 04:40:11,460
You really can't see anything

11294
04:40:10,200 --> 04:40:11,460
You really can't

11295
04:40:10,200 --> 04:40:11,460
You're right

11296
04:40:11,460 --> 04:40:13,840
I'm blind

11297
04:40:12,520 --> 04:40:14,630
Do you see people's shadows ahead?

11298
04:40:13,840 --> 04:40:14,630
What is it?

11299
04:40:14,810 --> 04:40:19,530
Human Shadows Ahead

11300
04:40:16,780 --> 04:40:18,760
That's scary

11301
04:40:18,530 --> 04:40:20,530
It was a little scary

11302
04:40:18,760 --> 04:40:20,530
That's scary isn't it

11303
04:40:19,680 --> 04:40:21,680
What's happening?

11304
04:40:19,700 --> 04:40:23,740
It's actually an old woman holding a baby

11305
04:40:20,010 --> 04:40:21,680
No no no no nooo

11306
04:40:21,850 --> 04:40:23,740
That's enough

11307
04:40:23,150 --> 04:40:26,920
It was scary, but we couldn't see her

11308
04:40:23,750 --> 04:40:28,870
Aaaahhhhhh Aaaaahhh

11309
04:40:24,220 --> 04:40:26,920
You couldn't see

11310
04:40:24,700 --> 04:40:26,920
You really couldn't see

11311
04:40:26,900 --> 04:40:28,870
Heipo, what is it?

11312
04:40:28,870 --> 04:40:30,070
There's something AAHHH

11313
04:40:29,070 --> 04:40:30,070
Let's go

11314
04:40:30,070 --> 04:40:32,080
It's all black and white,
so you can't tell what's there

11315
04:40:30,940 --> 04:40:32,080
It's so hard to see

11316
04:40:32,080 --> 04:40:35,250
It would be nice if they lit her up
with a lantern or something

11317
04:40:35,250 --> 04:40:36,680
Look it's moving!!

11318
04:40:36,680 --> 04:40:41,550
Ahhhhh AHHHHH

11319
04:40:38,850 --> 04:40:41,550
Shut up, Heipo

11320
04:40:41,690 --> 04:40:44,620
Who is it? Who is it?

11321
04:40:42,540 --> 04:40:44,620
Who's there?

11322
04:40:44,890 --> 04:40:46,120
AHHHHHH

11323
04:40:46,120 --> 04:40:48,790
Who is it? I can't see a damn thing!

11324
04:40:47,320 --> 04:40:48,790
What? WHO?

11325
04:40:48,790 --> 04:40:51,430
AHHHhhh What is this?

11326
04:40:50,660 --> 04:40:51,800
That's so scary

11327
04:40:51,800 --> 04:40:54,900
Scary scary scary

11328
04:40:54,900 --> 04:40:56,700
I can't see I can't see

11329
04:40:55,350 --> 04:40:56,700
You really couldn't see

11330
04:40:56,700 --> 04:40:58,500
It's a ghost!

11331
04:40:57,250 --> 04:40:58,500
WHAT WHAT

11332
04:40:58,740 --> 04:41:00,640
It was the ghost of an old woman

11333
04:41:00,640 --> 04:41:03,680
An old woman? What the heck

11334
04:41:01,090 --> 04:41:03,680
It was an old woman, didn't you see?

11335
04:41:01,670 --> 04:41:04,120
That's scary

11336
04:41:02,390 --> 04:41:03,680
I want to stop!

11337
04:41:02,770 --> 04:41:04,120
Creepy, right?

11338
04:41:03,680 --> 04:41:06,440
Ahhh! I hate it! I hate it! I'm leaving!

11339
04:41:05,680 --> 04:41:06,440
Where are you going?

11340
04:41:06,440 --> 04:41:07,210
Where are you going?

11341
04:41:07,210 --> 04:41:08,180
I wanna go home

11342
04:41:08,180 --> 04:41:11,350
What the hell are you saying... I'll kill you!!

11343
04:41:11,350 --> 04:41:13,850
Why the hell are you saying you want to go home?

11344
04:41:14,870 --> 04:41:16,760
It's too dark, I can't do this

11345
04:41:16,940 --> 04:41:21,830
Abandoned Trash

11346
04:41:16,940 --> 04:41:21,830
m 0 0 l 0 -60 l 380 -60 l 380 0 l 0 0

11347
04:41:17,020 --> 04:41:20,090
I can't see anything

11348
04:41:17,890 --> 04:41:20,090
I really can't see

11349
04:41:19,370 --> 04:41:20,090
I can't see

11350
04:41:20,190 --> 04:41:21,830
Without the lanterns we'd be totally blind

11351
04:41:21,830 --> 04:41:25,160
It's really dark

11352
04:41:21,980 --> 04:41:25,160
At this time of night there's no way I can see in front of me

11353
04:41:22,180 --> 04:41:27,900
Of course these four can't see it

11354
04:41:25,160 --> 04:41:27,900
This is a mountain, inside the mountain

11355
04:41:26,910 --> 04:41:27,900
That's right

11356
04:41:27,900 --> 04:41:30,770
It's pitch black...

11357
04:41:29,070 --> 04:41:30,770
Pitch black

11358
04:41:30,920 --> 04:41:34,670
It's scary, I can't see

11359
04:41:31,700 --> 04:41:34,670
This is dangerous

11360
04:41:35,120 --> 04:41:36,770
I'm no good at thi- Ah?

11361
04:41:37,510 --> 04:41:38,510
SOMETHING'S HERE

11362
04:41:38,510 --> 04:41:40,310
Oh no!!!

11363
04:41:38,510 --> 04:41:40,510
AAAaaAAAhhhh

11364
04:41:40,710 --> 04:41:42,700
We really should quit, what do I do, I'm so scared!

11365
04:41:42,710 --> 04:41:45,250
Shut up already!!

11366
04:41:46,120 --> 04:41:47,990
I don't understand!!

11367
04:41:46,820 --> 04:41:47,990
I don't see anything

11368
04:41:48,250 --> 04:41:51,690
What is this... It's creepy

11369
04:41:50,400 --> 04:41:51,690
Where are we?

11370
04:41:51,690 --> 04:41:54,790
This isn't Hosei or Endo, right

11371
04:41:53,520 --> 04:41:54,790
No it's not

11372
04:41:54,970 --> 04:42:01,400
They eagerly continue searching for the other two

11373
04:42:01,400 --> 04:42:05,640
Does your eldest son bathe with you?

11374
04:42:03,840 --> 04:42:05,640
I bathe with him when I'm home

11375
04:42:04,730 --> 04:42:07,620
They're so relaxed

11376
04:42:05,640 --> 04:42:08,910
Just recently, he's had some teeth pulled

11377
04:42:05,890 --> 04:42:07,620
What the heck?

11378
04:42:09,620 --> 04:42:14,450
Getting teeth pulled is torture

11379
04:42:11,420 --> 04:42:14,450
Things really do change

11380
04:42:14,630 --> 04:42:19,750
Idly talking about their family with love

11381
04:42:15,030 --> 04:42:17,010
I wish I was at home

11382
04:42:17,850 --> 04:42:21,140
Yeah, you were waiting that whole time

11383
04:42:20,830 --> 04:42:26,220
They take small, uneasy steps, as the visibility is almost completely zero

11384
04:42:22,200 --> 04:42:26,220
Bad Visibility

11385
04:42:22,420 --> 04:42:26,220
Unsure



Footing

11386
04:42:26,240 --> 04:42:29,230
Walking in total darkness for 30 minutes

11387
04:42:29,430 --> 04:42:35,470
In the darkness is a mysterious building

11388
04:42:31,210 --> 04:42:32,930
Should we go here?

11389
04:42:32,030 --> 04:42:32,930
Go where?

11390
04:42:32,930 --> 04:42:35,470
There's an arrow here, is there a door?

11391
04:42:33,850 --> 04:42:35,470
Ohhh?

11392
04:42:35,570 --> 04:42:38,100
Do we go in?

11393
04:42:36,030 --> 04:42:38,100
This is the worst

11394
04:42:38,750 --> 04:42:40,750
This is scary... Ahhhh

11395
04:42:41,890 --> 04:42:45,140
Arriving at the destination

11396
04:42:42,270 --> 04:42:43,590
Oh no

11397
04:42:45,140 --> 04:42:49,480
Open the wooden box








Retrieve the stone slab

11398
04:42:45,340 --> 04:42:47,530
Open the wooden box

11399
04:42:47,530 --> 04:42:49,480
Retrieve the stone slab

11400
04:42:49,530 --> 04:42:52,550
How should we open it?

11401
04:42:50,960 --> 04:42:52,550
Lift it-

11402
04:42:52,630 --> 04:42:53,950
Lift it up and open it

11403
04:42:54,230 --> 04:42:57,420
I already hate this

11404
04:42:54,900 --> 04:43:01,520
Prank incoming in           seconds

11405
04:42:56,020 --> 04:42:57,420
Let's go in order

11406
04:42:58,240 --> 04:43:00,440
Ready go

11407
04:43:05,160 --> 04:43:10,870
A skeleton hidden in the wall

11408
04:43:06,460 --> 04:43:08,450
Whatwhatwhat?

11409
04:43:08,730 --> 04:43:10,870
That shocked me, ugh...

11410
04:43:11,740 --> 04:43:12,770
What what what?

11411
04:43:12,770 --> 04:43:14,440
Is this it?

11412
04:43:13,750 --> 04:43:16,120
Ah, you're right those are slabs

11413
04:43:14,440 --> 04:43:19,080
2 slabs discovered

11414
04:43:15,260 --> 04:43:16,120
They were there

11415
04:43:16,120 --> 04:43:18,090
Those are slabs

11416
04:43:18,090 --> 04:43:19,080
That's it

11417
04:43:19,260 --> 04:43:28,950
Hosei and Endo wait in the sacred shrine

11418
04:43:20,190 --> 04:43:25,720
With the slabs, they have confirmed that the other 2 are waiting in the sacred shrine

11419
04:43:25,720 --> 04:43:28,950
They try to hurry there, but-

11420
04:43:30,790 --> 04:43:36,890
The door won't open

11421
04:43:31,440 --> 04:43:33,500
Huh?

11422
04:43:32,220 --> 04:43:35,380
This sucks...

11423
04:43:33,510 --> 04:43:35,380
No way

11424
04:43:34,320 --> 04:43:35,380
Wait

11425
04:43:35,380 --> 04:43:36,890
Are we locked in?

11426
04:43:36,910 --> 04:43:43,520
Prank incoming in             seconds

11427
04:43:43,430 --> 04:43:44,950
What?

11428
04:43:47,520 --> 04:43:49,990
It was locked

11429
04:43:48,510 --> 04:43:52,110
The ceiling lowers with great force

11430
04:43:50,890 --> 04:43:52,110
That's scary

11431
04:44:00,250 --> 04:44:02,990
That scared me... Damnit...

11432
04:44:02,350 --> 04:44:03,290
That's so scary!

11433
04:44:03,290 --> 04:44:04,820
This isn't okay

11434
04:44:04,820 --> 04:44:08,730
That's dangerous...

11435
04:44:06,220 --> 04:44:08,730
We're stuck

11436
04:44:10,160 --> 04:44:13,970
Isn't there an exit somewhere?

11437
04:44:11,830 --> 04:44:13,970
An exit? Where?

11438
04:44:14,550 --> 04:44:17,840
Why don't we try that again, now that we're down here?

11439
04:44:16,470 --> 04:44:17,840
Ouch, Ow, Oof

11440
04:44:17,840 --> 04:44:19,840
Let's try opening the door from down here

11441
04:44:20,840 --> 04:44:22,110
Aahhhh it opened!

11442
04:44:22,110 --> 04:44:25,440
The door opened

11443
04:44:22,140 --> 04:44:23,740
It's open

11444
04:44:23,740 --> 04:44:25,440
It's open

11445
04:44:24,110 --> 04:44:25,440
It's open it's open

11446
04:44:25,910 --> 04:44:28,280
It's open, it's open

11447
04:44:28,580 --> 04:44:30,630
Uwaaa

11448
04:44:30,680 --> 04:44:33,720
Shut up already

11449
04:44:32,750 --> 04:44:34,050
He just couldn't stop talking

11450
04:44:34,200 --> 04:44:40,490
After following the track for one hour

11451
04:44:34,200 --> 04:44:40,490
the four have returned to the tunnel

11452
04:44:39,690 --> 04:44:42,130
That was long

11453
04:44:40,170 --> 04:44:42,130
For sure, that was long

11454
04:44:41,090 --> 04:44:45,100
When Heipo joins us,







Tanaka seems somewhat dependable

11455
04:44:45,100 --> 04:44:49,100
Looking at myself objectively...

11456
04:44:49,100 --> 04:44:51,440
"Where are we going?" "I WANNA GO HOME" , he says

11457
04:44:51,700 --> 04:44:55,110
Like he's a








5 year old kid!!

11458
04:44:55,290 --> 04:45:03,180
Since his help is unwanted, Heipo is withdrawn

11459
04:45:03,360 --> 04:45:09,220
They set out for the sacred shrine

11460
04:45:09,400 --> 04:45:17,460
All three are exhausted

11461
04:45:11,590 --> 04:45:16,960
Come on...

11462
04:45:12,790 --> 04:45:16,960
It's pretty muddy

11463
04:45:14,640 --> 04:45:16,960
It's muddy

11464
04:45:17,630 --> 04:45:20,970
Hosei and Endo get to just take it easy this whole time

11465
04:45:19,480 --> 04:45:20,970
You're damn right

11466
04:45:22,300 --> 04:45:23,600
Is this it on our left?

11467
04:45:23,770 --> 04:45:26,470
Isn't this it?

11468
04:45:23,770 --> 04:45:28,040
The Sacred Shrine

11469
04:45:23,770 --> 04:45:28,040
m 0 0 l 0 -53 l 280 -53 l 280 0 l 0 0

11470
04:45:26,520 --> 04:45:28,040
Oh there are stone slabs there

11471
04:45:28,150 --> 04:45:31,940
HEYYYY WE'RE IN HERE

11472
04:45:28,240 --> 04:45:31,940
Inside the shrine, the two wait

11473
04:45:30,760 --> 04:45:31,940
HEYYYYY

11474
04:45:32,610 --> 04:45:37,650
Using the two stone slabs, they enter the shrine

11475
04:45:32,760 --> 04:45:34,200
They're here

11476
04:45:34,200 --> 04:45:37,010
So, it's this huh

11477
04:45:35,180 --> 04:45:37,010
That's it

11478
04:45:37,010 --> 04:45:41,590
When we put it together, we'll see who it is

11479
04:45:37,830 --> 04:45:41,990
Insert the slabs


to reveal the face

11480
04:45:39,600 --> 04:45:41,590
It's one of those

11481
04:45:39,600 --> 04:45:41,590
It's that kind of thing

11482
04:45:42,470 --> 04:45:44,670
This goes like this, first

11483
04:45:45,920 --> 04:45:48,160
There. And this one

11484
04:45:46,240 --> 04:45:48,160
Right

11485
04:45:46,660 --> 04:45:48,160
WE'RE HERE WE'RE HERE

11486
04:45:48,160 --> 04:45:52,130
Sure, hold on

11487
04:45:48,610 --> 04:45:52,130
WE'RE HERE

11488
04:45:50,330 --> 04:45:52,130
Oh it's Hanako

11489
04:45:56,170 --> 04:46:01,410
The doors to the shrine open

11490
04:45:57,000 --> 04:45:59,850
It opened!

11491
04:45:57,450 --> 04:45:59,850
It's open

11492
04:45:59,850 --> 04:46:01,810
Thank you

11493
04:45:59,850 --> 04:46:01,810
Thanks

11494
04:46:01,810 --> 04:46:03,110
Him too!!

11495
04:46:03,110 --> 04:46:06,010
He has bangs like Kawai Shunichi

11496
04:46:04,920 --> 04:46:06,010
Wha- Who?

11497
04:46:06,430 --> 04:46:12,980
Endo was attacked by the white makeup gang

11498
04:46:06,430 --> 04:46:12,980
Endo was attacked by the white makeup gang

11499
04:46:07,080 --> 04:46:10,010
They came in the room and swarmed him

11500
04:46:10,010 --> 04:46:11,870
I had no idea what was happening

11501
04:46:11,870 --> 04:46:14,540
Oh I see

11502
04:46:12,300 --> 04:46:14,540
Just like his partner Tanaka

11503
04:46:12,320 --> 04:46:14,540
They kept yelling like "Gwaah!"

11504
04:46:14,540 --> 04:46:18,920
They set his hair with gel

11505
04:46:14,920 --> 04:46:19,690
Hair gelled identically like Tanaka

11506
04:46:21,820 --> 04:46:23,560
Oh they did up it nicely

11507
04:46:22,460 --> 04:46:23,560
They did what?

11508
04:46:24,130 --> 04:46:28,900
Kawai Shunichi's bangs, apparently

11509
04:46:25,510 --> 04:46:26,480
Yes

11510
04:46:26,060 --> 04:46:26,480
Is that it?

11511
04:46:26,480 --> 04:46:28,900
Shunichi's bangs...?

11512
04:46:29,080 --> 04:46:33,020
Hosei and Endo were successfully rescued!

11513
04:46:33,170 --> 04:46:35,170
Then

11514
04:46:35,940 --> 04:46:40,780
Flowing out




a radiant light

11515
04:46:36,090 --> 04:46:40,780
From within the shrine, a light flowed out

11516
04:46:40,880 --> 04:46:42,300
What's this?

11517
04:46:42,300 --> 04:46:43,800
A golden...

11518
04:46:43,800 --> 04:46:46,620
Daisuke Miyagawa sculpture

11519
04:46:43,800 --> 04:46:46,620
T/N: Skull, sculpture. Another play on words.

11520
04:46:46,630 --> 04:46:49,750
(Daisuke Miyagawa and Hanako)


Cookie sure loves those two

11521
04:46:49,750 --> 04:46:50,490
Yes

11522
04:46:50,490 --> 04:46:55,160
Is it okay if we just take this sculpture?

11523
04:46:52,260 --> 04:46:55,160
We're treasure hunters, you know

11524
04:46:53,460 --> 04:46:55,160
That's right

11525
04:46:55,380 --> 04:46:57,590
I see

11526
04:46:55,710 --> 04:46:57,590
Oh right

11527
04:46:56,310 --> 04:46:57,590
Right

11528
04:46:56,530 --> 04:46:57,600
I get it, I get it

11529
04:46:58,100 --> 04:47:00,100
Let's take it

11530
04:46:59,260 --> 04:47:04,450
Us? Well, I really don't know if we should...

11531
04:47:00,730 --> 04:47:04,450
It's gotta be you

11532
04:47:02,680 --> 04:47:04,450
We had to do everything up till now

11533
04:47:03,470 --> 04:47:04,970
We did all that adventuring, right?

11534
04:47:04,730 --> 04:47:05,320
Right

11535
04:47:05,320 --> 04:47:06,800
Let's take it together

11536
04:47:06,100 --> 04:47:06,800
Got it

11537
04:47:06,800 --> 04:47:08,510
Is it okay?

11538
04:47:08,510 --> 04:47:10,710
It's okay to take this, right?

11539
04:47:10,340 --> 04:47:10,710
Right

11540
04:47:10,710 --> 04:47:13,880
You have to get the treasure, I think

11541
04:47:11,560 --> 04:47:13,880
I think so

11542
04:47:12,360 --> 04:47:13,880
Should we take it together?

11543
04:47:14,040 --> 04:47:15,140
We're taking it

11544
04:47:15,130 --> 04:47:17,450
Ready-

11545
04:47:17,450 --> 04:47:22,650
Sudden tremors

11546
04:47:25,810 --> 04:47:31,330
How dare they!







The golden Daisuke Miyagawa sculpture has been stolen!

11547
04:47:27,370 --> 04:47:31,330
How dare they!







The golden Daisuke Miyagawa sculpture has been stolen!

11548
04:47:31,380 --> 04:47:35,000
Because of you







"He" will be awakened!

11549
04:47:32,660 --> 04:47:35,000
Because of you







"He" will be awakened!

11550
04:47:35,000 --> 04:47:35,970
Quick! Run!

11551
04:47:36,020 --> 04:47:40,040
Otherwise!







Otherwise something bad will happen to you!

11552
04:47:36,900 --> 04:47:40,040
Otherwise!







Otherwise something bad will happen to you!

11553
04:47:45,690 --> 04:47:48,110
HELLO EVERYBODY

11554
04:47:45,690 --> 04:47:48,110
HELLO EVERYBODY

11555
04:47:49,860 --> 04:47:52,980
Is your wife







making miso soup again today?

11556
04:47:49,960 --> 04:47:55,050
Giant Emperor

11557
04:47:50,700 --> 04:47:52,980
Is your wife







making miso soup again today?

11558
04:47:53,020 --> 04:47:55,050
Is she making it!?

11559
04:47:55,070 --> 04:47:58,690
You there!







You stole my treasure, didn't you!

11560
04:47:55,940 --> 04:47:58,690
You there!







You stole my treasure, didn't you!

11561
04:47:58,690 --> 04:48:01,590
Aha~!







The great emperor is angry~!

11562
04:47:59,710 --> 04:48:01,590
Aha~!







The great emperor is angry~!

11563
04:48:01,610 --> 04:48:02,990
I don't know what's going to happen to you~!

11564
04:48:03,010 --> 04:48:04,460
I don't know what's going to happen to you~!

11565
04:48:04,460 --> 04:48:07,500
I don't know what's going to happen to you...

11566
04:48:09,100 --> 04:48:11,540
Trying to get away?!?!

11567
04:48:13,900 --> 04:48:16,370
A boulder fell into the shrine

11568
04:48:17,260 --> 04:48:19,090
What do we do?

11569
04:48:17,640 --> 04:48:19,090
Do we run?

11570
04:48:18,040 --> 04:48:23,080
Sirens signal catastrophe

11571
04:48:19,090 --> 04:48:21,480
I can't see

11572
04:48:19,580 --> 04:48:21,480
Let's run

11573
04:48:21,480 --> 04:48:23,310
This way!

11574
04:48:22,300 --> 04:48:23,310
That's right

11575
04:48:23,310 --> 04:48:26,050
Watch your feet

11576
04:48:24,050 --> 04:48:26,050
That looks like it

11577
04:48:26,530 --> 04:48:28,220
Careful, careful

11578
04:48:28,220 --> 04:48:30,320
Wait wait

11579
04:48:30,320 --> 04:48:31,960
What's happening~?

11580
04:48:30,440 --> 04:48:31,960
Where are we going?

11581
04:48:32,140 --> 04:48:37,360
5-man pedal-car escape

11582
04:48:32,810 --> 04:48:34,590
Oh look, there's more

11583
04:48:34,590 --> 04:48:38,480
Oh no! Hamada, are you coming?

11584
04:48:35,540 --> 04:48:38,480
Walking would be faster, though

11585
04:48:37,790 --> 04:48:41,030
Every year...

11586
04:48:38,950 --> 04:48:42,880
You have to slip your legs in

11587
04:48:40,250 --> 04:48:42,880
Is this good?

11588
04:48:42,880 --> 04:48:46,050
Okay, let's pedal

11589
04:48:43,670 --> 04:48:46,050
Ready, go

11590
04:48:44,280 --> 04:48:50,870
Prank incoming in           seconds

11591
04:48:46,050 --> 04:48:47,520
Like this

11592
04:48:46,640 --> 04:48:47,520
Like this?

11593
04:48:47,520 --> 04:48:50,870
Let's go slow

11594
04:48:48,600 --> 04:48:50,870
Sorry, my foot

11595
04:48:51,290 --> 04:48:53,910
But that's-

11596
04:48:54,660 --> 04:48:57,650
Emperor

11597
04:48:54,660 --> 04:48:57,650
Giant

11598
04:48:56,460 --> 04:48:58,580
It's coming!

11599
04:48:59,080 --> 04:49:00,320
Scary scary scary scary

11600
04:49:00,320 --> 04:49:03,020
That's actually scary!

11601
04:49:03,020 --> 04:49:06,560
Go faster!

11602
04:49:06,560 --> 04:49:08,730
Brother grandchild grandchild grandchild

11603
04:49:10,530 --> 04:49:13,500
Aren't you getting hot?

11604
04:49:11,290 --> 04:49:13,500
That's hot

11605
04:49:16,200 --> 04:49:18,570
Hot!

11606
04:49:16,630 --> 04:49:18,570
He's coming, he's coming!

11607
04:49:21,140 --> 04:49:22,770
Wow

11608
04:49:24,490 --> 04:49:26,490
Wow

11609
04:49:27,840 --> 04:49:33,120
Let's run!

11610
04:49:29,010 --> 04:49:33,850
They all make it out safely

11611
04:49:30,130 --> 04:49:33,120
This is divine punishment

11612
04:49:33,220 --> 04:49:34,920
Let's go

11613
04:49:34,920 --> 04:49:36,240
That's scary

11614
04:49:36,240 --> 04:49:37,560
"We don't have money" they say

11615
04:49:37,560 --> 04:49:41,560
You just threw a ton of cash at this thing!

11616
04:49:38,500 --> 04:49:40,510
Seriously

11617
04:49:44,130 --> 04:49:48,000
Research Lab - 19 hours have passed

11618
04:49:48,870 --> 04:49:52,140
As new treasure hunters

11619
04:49:52,140 --> 04:49:55,140
The five men

11620
04:49:55,140 --> 04:49:58,120
Have faced grueling trials

11621
04:49:59,290 --> 04:50:02,550
Having conquered all the chaos

11622
04:50:02,550 --> 04:50:04,550
Finally

11623
04:50:04,550 --> 04:50:07,650
They've come upon that moment

11624
04:50:09,890 --> 04:50:10,840
Everyone

11625
04:50:10,840 --> 04:50:13,940
The treasure hunter training was long, but it's finally over

11626
04:50:13,940 --> 04:50:16,190
YES!

11627
04:50:14,110 --> 04:50:16,190
Good work

11628
04:50:16,880 --> 04:50:18,460
Finally

11629
04:50:22,100 --> 04:50:25,570
It's already become 2019 now

11630
04:50:24,970 --> 04:50:27,620
2019, huh?

11631
04:50:25,770 --> 04:50:29,360
Research Lab - Entrance

11632
04:50:28,270 --> 04:50:29,790
We're done

11633
04:50:29,710 --> 04:50:34,210
Happy New Year!

11634
04:50:30,340 --> 04:50:31,490
2019...

11635
04:50:31,490 --> 04:50:33,660
There he is

11636
04:50:34,580 --> 04:50:40,780
At last, let's end things with a


treasure hunter riddle

11637
04:50:36,950 --> 04:50:38,250
Huh?

11638
04:50:39,980 --> 04:50:41,950
Oh, that's a nice idea

11639
04:50:40,780 --> 04:50:41,950
Then please finish it off cleanly

11640
04:50:41,950 --> 04:50:43,890
Then, here I go

11641
04:50:43,100 --> 04:50:43,890
Alright

11642
04:50:43,970 --> 04:50:49,290
In regards to treasure hunting,







I will reveal something about Matsumoto Hitoshi

11643
04:50:46,720 --> 04:50:49,290
I will reveal something about Matsumoto Hitoshi

11644
04:50:49,290 --> 04:50:50,830
And that is?

11645
04:50:50,040 --> 04:50:51,380
And that is

11646
04:50:51,380 --> 04:50:55,500
Your bodybuilding must be tough

11647
04:50:54,200 --> 04:50:55,500
Wait, do I have that wrong...?

11648
04:50:55,500 --> 04:50:57,800
Huh? What does that mean?

11649
04:50:57,820 --> 04:51:03,140
In regards to treasure hunting,



I will be Matsumoto Hitoshi...

11650
04:50:59,590 --> 04:51:00,720
Yes

11651
04:50:59,900 --> 04:51:00,720
Yes

11652
04:51:00,500 --> 04:51:03,140
I will be Matsumoto Hitoshi...

11653
04:51:02,140 --> 04:51:03,140
Ack

11654
04:51:04,310 --> 04:51:06,540
That's enough

11655
04:51:05,680 --> 04:51:08,760
That doesn't finish things off

11656
04:51:06,680 --> 04:51:08,760
That's enough

11657
04:51:08,760 --> 04:51:12,820
Please let me say it, this is the last thing, I'll say it properly this time

11658
04:51:09,380 --> 04:51:12,830
This isn't how you end things

11659
04:51:11,200 --> 04:51:12,830
That's enough, that's enough

11660
04:51:16,320 --> 04:51:17,550
I got Endo's recoil too...

11661
04:51:17,550 --> 04:51:19,090
I'll be leaving now

11662
04:51:19,090 --> 04:51:21,460
Pardon me... Yes! I'll be leaving now!

11663
04:51:19,090 --> 04:51:21,460
You're going to leave first?!

11664
04:51:21,460 --> 04:51:23,460
Farewell

11665
04:51:24,540 --> 04:51:28,400
That was horrible

11666
04:51:24,810 --> 04:51:28,400
Everyone, if you leave, it'll really be over

11667
04:51:24,830 --> 04:51:28,400
Yep

11668
04:51:29,270 --> 04:51:37,980

Tsukitei Hosei

11674
04:51:29,680 --> 04:51:34,300
That was a horrible finish

11675
04:51:31,600 --> 04:51:34,300
That was the last, would've been nice if he could've finished it

11676
04:51:40,110 --> 04:51:42,140
Who is it?

11677
04:51:44,000 --> 04:51:49,640

11678

04:57:19,060 --> 04:57:22,870
It was so difficult!

12641
04:57:20,880 --> 04:57:22,870
It's like, "What does this even mean?"

12642
04:57:22,870 --> 04:57:27,460
From the time Professor Daikichi started explaining, it made no sense

12643
04:57:26,110 --> 04:57:27,460
No sense at all

12644
04:57:27,460 --> 04:57:30,290
"What the hell is this?"

12645
04:57:30,290 --> 04:57:31,280
Thus

12646
04:57:31,280 --> 04:57:37,470
We hope you continue to watch Gaki no Tsukai in 2019!

12647
04:57:35,500 --> 04:57:37,480
Please

12648
04:57:35,500 --> 04:57:37,480
Please

12649
04:57:35,500 --> 04:57:37,480
Please

12650
04:57:42,240 --> 04:57:44,340
Good job everyone

12651
04:57:44,520 --> 04:57:49,550
This story is fictional.

All business names and other entities are fabricated.

12652
04:57:50,080 --> 04:57:54,670
For those who want to watch the Absolutely No Laughing Treasure Hunters again, please go to Hulu

12653
04:57:54,670 --> 04:57:59,250
THEN WHY DON'T YOU GODDAMN DO IT

12654
04:57:55,880 --> 04:57:59,250
The previous series are also being streamed!
