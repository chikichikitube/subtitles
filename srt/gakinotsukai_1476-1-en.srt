1
00:00:01,460 --> 00:00:07,300
Tonight's Gaki No Tsukai - Bamiyan Marathon Finale!

2
00:00:08,780 --> 00:00:14,400
Ba-ba-ba-ba-baaaaaaaaaaaamiyan!

3
00:00:14,540 --> 00:00:23,520
The rules; From a menu of 49, they pick 2 items at random for each store

4
00:00:23,520 --> 00:00:28,040
They aim to clear all 51 stores across 23 wards

5
00:00:29,440 --> 00:00:34,880
In this battle, whoever gives up has to pay for all the food eaten thus far

6
00:00:36,440 --> 00:00:44,540
Up until the 6th store, they've had 5 ramen dishes, and 0 rice dishes

7
00:00:45,400 --> 00:00:47,550
As well,

8
00:00:48,560 --> 00:00:52,000
The first person to rest?

9
00:00:52,580 --> 00:00:54,320
Hosei-san.

10
00:00:55,820 --> 00:00:57,640
Hosei-san.

11
00:01:00,620 --> 00:01:03,100
You guys fixed this again

12
00:01:04,000 --> 00:01:11,060
Hosei gets 3 breaks in a row while Matsumoto gets zero!
Nobody expected this!

13
00:01:12,560 --> 00:01:19,180
And tonight again, they will battle against Chinese food!

14
00:01:21,720 --> 00:01:25,220
They head for the 7th store, the Akatsuka-shinmachi location

15
00:01:27,280 --> 00:01:32,540
The menu for this store will be the Balsamic Black Vinegar Pork, and the Soft & Fluffy bread

16
00:01:33,140 --> 00:01:35,540
Speaking of noodles, there's still 13 dishes left

17
00:01:35,540 --> 00:01:37,200
There's still more noodle dishes?

18
00:01:37,200 --> 00:01:38,980
There's still more noodle dishes?

19
00:01:38,980 --> 00:01:40,980
I can't eat noodles anymore

20
00:01:42,090 --> 00:01:45,420
I'll say it explictly, I can't eat noodles

21
00:01:45,420 --> 00:01:47,070
You shouldn't say that so easily

22
00:01:48,660 --> 00:01:50,960
We're only at the 7th store

23
00:01:51,520 --> 00:01:53,860
But still

24
00:01:53,860 --> 00:01:56,080
I haven't gotten to rest once

25
00:01:56,080 --> 00:01:58,140
Yama-chan and Fujiwara...

26
00:01:58,140 --> 00:02:00,140
3 times in a row!

27
00:02:04,660 --> 00:02:07,420
He doesn't work at all

28
00:02:07,420 --> 00:02:16,200
We should be able to buy breaks, using money

29
00:02:11,930 --> 00:02:16,200
He's talking about money again

30
00:02:16,200 --> 00:02:18,340
How much would 1 break cost?

31
00:02:18,340 --> 00:02:20,800
Oh it doesn't matter

32
00:02:20,800 --> 00:02:25,340
I have a lot of money

33
00:02:23,640 --> 00:02:26,700
The dirtiest!

34
00:02:26,700 --> 00:02:32,220
I'm kidding I'm kidding. I said I'm kidding

35
00:02:36,420 --> 00:02:40,300
Let's stop the eating episodes

36
00:02:40,300 --> 00:02:43,260
We're pretty old now

37
00:02:43,260 --> 00:02:46,060
Let's get massages at Temomin instead

38
00:02:48,600 --> 00:02:50,700
Visit every branch of Temomin

39
00:02:50,700 --> 00:02:53,430
"Massaging my feet again?!"

40
00:02:53,430 --> 00:02:55,520
"My neck?!"

41
00:02:55,520 --> 00:02:57,670
"I don't need my neck massaged anymore!"

42
00:02:57,670 --> 00:03:03,900
We'll get so excited!

43
00:03:00,490 --> 00:03:03,920
Like hell we will!

44
00:03:05,380 --> 00:03:09,000
Meanwhile, they arrive at the Akatsuka location

45
00:03:11,140 --> 00:03:16,380
At this store they will enjoy, a splendid mix of black & balsamic vinegar sauce,

46
00:03:16,880 --> 00:03:19,340
Balsamic Black Vinegar Pork, and,

47
00:03:20,480 --> 00:03:24,660
Soft & Fluffy bread, which can be enjoyed with many dishes

48
00:03:27,040 --> 00:03:30,880
Fujiwara meanwhile will dig into Ogio Jelly with fruits

49
00:03:32,100 --> 00:03:33,100
Itadakimasu.

50
00:03:35,100 --> 00:03:38,310
I'll eat this together then

51
00:03:36,960 --> 00:03:39,860
I see, like that

52
00:03:42,500 --> 00:03:44,200
You guys are finishing this quick

53
00:03:48,340 --> 00:03:51,660
It's different from everything before

54
00:03:52,400 --> 00:03:56,080
And in an instant the 7th store is cleared!

55
00:03:56,680 --> 00:03:58,960
That was really quick

56
00:04:01,120 --> 00:04:03,630
Finished!

57
00:04:03,820 --> 00:04:07,280
And the next menu?

58
00:04:08,040 --> 00:04:10,760
Hong Kong Sweet & Sour Pork

59
00:04:11,330 --> 00:04:13,400
But still

60
00:04:14,120 --> 00:04:20,240
Come on, a rice dish!

61
00:04:20,240 --> 00:04:21,480
Uwaahhhh, please forgive me!

62
00:04:21,480 --> 00:04:26,480
Green onion ramen.

63
00:04:27,620 --> 00:04:30,100
Hong Kong

64
00:04:30,100 --> 00:04:34,240
(Complaining about more noodles)

65
00:04:34,240 --> 00:04:37,440
I even said explicitly I can't eat noodles

66
00:04:37,440 --> 00:04:41,320
I said it was impossible

67
00:04:38,860 --> 00:04:41,320
You did say that

68
00:04:43,500 --> 00:04:46,960
Somehow, the 6th ramen dish of the day!

69
00:04:48,480 --> 00:04:51,500
And the person who rests?

70
00:04:55,700 --> 00:04:58,200
This is just in time

71
00:04:58,800 --> 00:05:01,200
You just had a break

72
00:05:01,420 --> 00:05:03,920
You're taking too many breaks

73
00:05:01,980 --> 00:05:03,920
Amazing.

74
00:05:03,240 --> 00:05:03,920
You're kidding.

75
00:05:06,340 --> 00:05:09,520
I'll go with this, this vanilla ice cream

76
00:05:10,240 --> 00:05:14,640
Fried Bread with Vanilla Ice Cream, Hinako and Syrup

77
00:05:14,820 --> 00:05:17,660
This guys has actually rested for half the stores

78
00:05:19,280 --> 00:05:21,900
4 hours since the start

79
00:05:19,280 --> 00:05:21,900
The head towards the 8th store in Iidabashi

80
00:05:24,120 --> 00:05:27,940
No rice dishes yet huh

81
00:05:30,860 --> 00:05:35,940
There's no rice yes, but there's no Matsumoto card either!

82
00:05:36,260 --> 00:05:39,120
Which store is next?

83
00:05:37,470 --> 00:05:39,120
The 8th is next

84
00:05:39,120 --> 00:05:44,700
And you know what else, we even drew 2 cards at one point

85
00:05:44,700 --> 00:05:46,940
My card doesn't show up at all

86
00:05:46,940 --> 00:05:48,880
It's statistically too improbable

87
00:05:53,480 --> 00:05:57,390
Eh? You thought I was talking to myself?

88
00:05:57,390 --> 00:06:00,420
You're not?

89
00:06:00,980 --> 00:06:03,680
All he does is complain

90
00:06:06,030 --> 00:06:08,280
No no,

91
00:06:08,280 --> 00:06:11,740
I haven't complained once today

92
00:06:15,380 --> 00:06:18,000
The 8th store, the Iidabashi-aioi location

93
00:06:21,120 --> 00:06:26,600
At this store, with their homemade spices, Green Onion Ramen with plenty of Green Onion

94
00:06:29,360 --> 00:06:34,900
And notable for its sauce, the Hong Kong Sweet & Sour pork

95
00:06:38,990 --> 00:06:40,720
Is it good?

96
00:06:49,500 --> 00:06:51,600
Their speed has decreased,

97
00:06:55,680 --> 00:06:58,020
but they still finish!

98
00:06:58,020 --> 00:07:01,640
TIme for the 9th store's menu selection

99
00:07:02,960 --> 00:07:05,280
And of course, what they want is...

100
00:07:06,380 --> 00:07:10,090
Let's get 2 rice dishes here

101
00:07:12,480 --> 00:07:13,820
There it is

102
00:07:16,140 --> 00:07:18,820
Gomoku yakisoba.

103
00:07:21,240 --> 00:07:22,270
More noodle!

104
00:07:23,460 --> 00:07:25,640
And the next one,

105
00:07:24,080 --> 00:07:25,640
C'mon, please!

106
00:07:26,720 --> 00:07:28,260
And it is...

107
00:07:29,940 --> 00:07:31,440
Pepper steak

108
00:07:36,620 --> 00:07:38,900
It's pretty much the same as always

109
00:07:40,460 --> 00:07:41,840
The one who rests?

110
00:07:48,220 --> 00:07:50,580
You guys fixed this didn't you?

111
00:07:51,880 --> 00:07:54,970
They're dating

112
00:07:54,970 --> 00:07:58,180
They're dating

113
00:07:58,890 --> 00:08:03,240
Fujiwara who is resting again decided on Meat Miso Cucumber

114
00:08:05,400 --> 00:08:08,480
The status of their stomachs is of concern

115
00:08:09,700 --> 00:08:11,500
Hamada-san, how is your stomach doing?

116
00:08:12,300 --> 00:08:17,240
Well, well I am feeling it

117
00:08:17,590 --> 00:08:23,080
Now if we get rice it might be risky

118
00:08:23,230 --> 00:08:27,070
If we get rice & rice that will be risky

119
00:08:27,340 --> 00:08:30,580
Fujiwara and Yama-chan, you guys are totally fine right?

120
00:08:32,580 --> 00:08:34,980
You guys aren't eating much

121
00:08:35,120 --> 00:08:39,180
We want to see your perseverance

122
00:08:37,800 --> 00:08:39,180
Honestly,

123
00:08:39,180 --> 00:08:42,070
The time to persevere will come I think

124
00:08:40,580 --> 00:08:45,090
But just for now,

125
00:08:43,280 --> 00:08:45,090
Will you really persevere?

126
00:08:45,090 --> 00:08:49,520
I want to uphold the rules

127
00:08:50,100 --> 00:08:53,280
The fatigue is creeping up on them, they're almost at the limit

128
00:08:54,280 --> 00:08:56,780
Matsumoto proposes a plan

129
00:08:58,080 --> 00:09:02,140
How many dishes are left?

130
00:09:02,140 --> 00:09:05,170
We still have... 41 menu items left.

131
00:09:05,170 --> 00:09:07,940
We still have... 41 menu items left.

132
00:09:07,940 --> 00:09:11,240
There's STILL 41 left?

133
00:09:11,240 --> 00:09:15,140
On the contrary, I think if nobody rests,

134
00:09:15,140 --> 00:09:19,020
If we don't eat 3 dishes we won't finish

135
00:09:21,720 --> 00:09:26,130
Otherwise I think this won't end

136
00:09:23,780 --> 00:09:26,130
It won't

137
00:09:26,300 --> 00:09:27,830
Should we try that?

138
00:09:27,830 --> 00:09:30,880
Alright, so after finishing the next store,

139
00:09:30,880 --> 00:09:34,470
No breaks!

140
00:09:31,270 --> 00:09:33,960
No breaks, and 3 dishes

141
00:09:34,470 --> 00:09:36,640
Otherwise,

142
00:09:36,640 --> 00:09:40,470
We won't clear enough stores,

143
00:09:38,440 --> 00:09:42,600
Or eat enough items

144
00:09:42,600 --> 00:09:44,600
For now let's clear all the dishes

145
00:09:44,600 --> 00:09:46,940
How dare YOU say that

146
00:09:44,600 --> 00:09:48,220
What are YOU saying?

147
00:09:48,560 --> 00:09:50,950
Alright let's do this!

148
00:09:50,950 --> 00:09:56,780
(Excited agreement)

149
00:09:59,440 --> 00:10:03,060
Bamiyan Marathon - They've cleared 8 stores so far

150
00:10:03,540 --> 00:10:08,420
Up until now they've eaten 16 items - 6.7kg of food

151
00:10:10,780 --> 00:10:13,280
The 9th store, the Nerima-toyotama location

152
00:10:15,880 --> 00:10:21,090
They arrive during the dinner rush

153
00:10:25,500 --> 00:10:29,140
We'll eat at this type of booth for the first time today

154
00:10:30,160 --> 00:10:32,800
Here they'll eat the 7th noodle dish of the day,

155
00:10:33,180 --> 00:10:36,440
With lots of sauce on top, Gomoku yakisoba.

156
00:10:38,720 --> 00:10:43,640
And notable for its sauce, the Pepper steak

157
00:10:50,360 --> 00:10:51,860
This is really good!

158
00:10:52,360 --> 00:10:55,360
There are a lot of toppings

159
00:10:57,840 --> 00:11:00,790
Isn't this too much?!

160
00:11:00,790 --> 00:11:03,720
It's the same as everyone, really

161
00:11:03,720 --> 00:11:05,620
Look at this!

162
00:11:05,620 --> 00:11:10,180
There's so many goddamn noodles

163
00:11:08,420 --> 00:11:10,180
It's the same

164
00:11:10,180 --> 00:11:12,100
This is scary

165
00:11:12,100 --> 00:11:14,810
This dining table is scary

166
00:11:14,810 --> 00:11:17,440
There's no noodles in there!

167
00:11:17,440 --> 00:11:20,400
There's so many-There's a mountain of them in here

168
00:11:20,220 --> 00:11:23,270
See!

169
00:11:25,660 --> 00:11:27,940
Even as they betray each other,

170
00:11:29,240 --> 00:11:31,080
They manage to finish!

171
00:11:33,480 --> 00:11:37,200
And now to decide their fate with the menu selection

172
00:11:37,900 --> 00:11:41,280
Alright let's go with Matsumoto's plan

173
00:11:41,280 --> 00:11:43,730
Let's go with 3?

174
00:11:41,980 --> 00:11:43,730
Let's make 3 the standard

175
00:11:43,730 --> 00:11:47,970
Lets see what the menu is, and if we think we can do it we'll pick another item

176
00:11:48,280 --> 00:11:53,880
Starting now, there will be no breaks, and they'll eat 3 dishes per store

177
00:11:54,540 --> 00:11:56,600
The total exhaustion strategy

178
00:11:58,600 --> 00:12:00,100
The menu;

179
00:12:01,960 --> 00:12:04,100
Congratulations

180
00:12:04,100 --> 00:12:06,100
Tenshinhan! (Crab Omelette on Rice)

181
00:12:07,660 --> 00:12:11,480
And now a rice dish, you finally got one

182
00:12:12,720 --> 00:12:14,380
Tenshinhan

183
00:12:14,380 --> 00:12:17,220
Well just one is fine

184
00:12:18,640 --> 00:12:20,140
The second dish,

185
00:12:21,620 --> 00:12:24,360
Firm and crispy, Shio Koji Marinade Fried Chicken

186
00:12:24,780 --> 00:12:30,680
(This one is alright, this is good)

187
00:12:31,800 --> 00:12:33,280
The 3rd dish,

188
00:12:33,800 --> 00:12:36,560
Authentically rich, Hakata Tonkutsu Ramen

189
00:12:40,000 --> 00:12:41,920
Hakata Ramen? Now?

190
00:12:41,920 --> 00:12:45,830
Well we gotta do this without breaks

191
00:12:44,500 --> 00:12:45,830
You will do it?

192
00:12:45,830 --> 00:12:48,860
So Matsumoto-san, another dish?

193
00:12:49,020 --> 00:12:51,620
With the fried chicken this will be 4

194
00:12:51,620 --> 00:12:53,620
The 4th one alright

195
00:12:56,620 --> 00:12:57,920
What is this?!

196
00:12:58,420 --> 00:12:59,920
Mountain of fried potatoes.

197
00:13:06,220 --> 00:13:09,240
I feel really depressed now

198
00:13:10,000 --> 00:13:13,580
These 4 dishes will be the menu for the 10th store

199
00:13:18,320 --> 00:13:23,300
I'm kind of starting to feel it now

200
00:13:21,300 --> 00:13:23,300
The Yakisoba?

201
00:13:23,300 --> 00:13:25,670
You didn't have that much Soba in your plate!

202
00:13:25,670 --> 00:13:29,440
I had so much

203
00:13:29,440 --> 00:13:33,770
...Hamada.

204
00:13:33,770 --> 00:13:36,680
Tanaka you didn't put enough in

205
00:13:36,680 --> 00:13:40,010
I tried to make it even

206
00:13:40,010 --> 00:13:44,380
You put the most noodles in my dish!

207
00:13:44,380 --> 00:13:47,020
Even if he did,

208
00:13:47,020 --> 00:13:52,060
With all of those families around, all of those kids

209
00:13:52,060 --> 00:13:56,430
Making such a scary face there...

210
00:13:56,430 --> 00:13:59,180
Yelling in such an angry way...

211
00:13:59,180 --> 00:14:01,370
I thought "You shouldn't do that here"

212
00:14:01,370 --> 00:14:03,940
They were all there to eat out

213
00:14:03,020 --> 00:14:04,690
Exactly exactly

214
00:14:03,940 --> 00:14:06,560
Hold on, that's not what we were talking about

215
00:14:06,560 --> 00:14:10,080
I was saying he didn't have any noodles

216
00:14:10,080 --> 00:14:12,910
And one of the kids there was trembling in fear,

217
00:14:12,580 --> 00:14:16,950
And handed me this crumpled Origami dinosaur

218
00:14:16,950 --> 00:14:19,110
They must've been scared

219
00:14:19,120 --> 00:14:21,980
He handed it to you normally!

220
00:14:21,990 --> 00:14:25,440
No no he was trembling

221
00:14:25,440 --> 00:14:27,030
I felt bad for him,

222
00:14:27,030 --> 00:14:31,320
Hearing you complaining about the noodles

223
00:14:32,200 --> 00:14:34,840
How about we do pairs?

224
00:14:34,840 --> 00:14:37,420
Eat one dish in pairs

225
00:14:37,880 --> 00:14:39,510
I'll do it if it's with Tanaka-san

226
00:14:39,510 --> 00:14:44,410
If we pair up Senpai-Kouhai,

227
00:14:44,410 --> 00:14:46,620
The kouhai will end up disadvantaged

228
00:14:46,620 --> 00:14:50,700
So how should we-

229
00:14:48,100 --> 00:14:50,700
What we have here is the best isn't it?

230
00:14:50,700 --> 00:14:52,950
What we have here

231
00:14:52,950 --> 00:14:54,820
The seating rows here

232
00:14:54,820 --> 00:14:56,920
Like us, them, and you?

233
00:14:56,920 --> 00:14:59,630
We can just decide with rock paper scissors

234
00:14:59,630 --> 00:15:03,800
You really hated that idea just now

235
00:15:03,800 --> 00:15:09,180
Hamada-san, I hate it too

236
00:15:07,240 --> 00:15:09,180
What should we do then

237
00:15:12,690 --> 00:15:16,490
Being with DownTown-san is a disadvantage

238
00:15:16,490 --> 00:15:17,680
Yes it is

239
00:15:17,680 --> 00:15:19,040
Okamoto said it didn't he?

240
00:15:17,680 --> 00:15:21,860
TN: Referring to 2019 Yoshimoto Scandal with Miyasako

241
00:15:19,040 --> 00:15:21,860
We're a family here!

242
00:15:21,860 --> 00:15:24,940
He cried didn't he?!

243
00:15:25,700 --> 00:15:30,080
Bamiyan Marathon, the 10th store is the Senkawa Station location

244
00:15:32,700 --> 00:15:36,520
Starting here, they will finish 4 dishes at a time

245
00:15:37,520 --> 00:15:39,220
The mountain of fried potatoes

246
00:15:42,120 --> 00:15:44,860
The Shio Koji marinade Fried Chicken

247
00:15:47,220 --> 00:15:48,740
The Tenshinhan

248
00:15:51,940 --> 00:15:55,300
Tonkatsu Ramen

249
00:15:55,720 --> 00:15:57,720
First time having rice

250
00:16:03,300 --> 00:16:05,930
Alright, you've finished

251
00:16:05,930 --> 00:16:09,320
Chinese Okowa Lotus Leaf Wrap

252
00:16:11,240 --> 00:16:12,900
Fried Chicken with Tartar Sauce

253
00:16:12,900 --> 00:16:14,970
Ah, Fried Chicken?

254
00:16:14,970 --> 00:16:18,880
Shrimp with mayonnaise salad.

255
00:16:18,880 --> 00:16:24,110
2 varieties of Char Siu with 4 types of Tsukemen

256
00:16:24,110 --> 00:16:28,660
The 11th store - Nakano Sakaue

257
00:16:28,660 --> 00:16:31,400
Thank you for waiting

258
00:16:31,400 --> 00:16:33,060
Here's the shrimp salad.

259
00:16:33,060 --> 00:16:36,680
The Crispy & Juicy Tartar Fried Chicken

260
00:16:37,000 --> 00:16:40,320
I see, very oily

261
00:16:41,330 --> 00:16:42,860
The Char Siu & Tsukemen

262
00:16:42,860 --> 00:16:44,440
This one is great!

263
00:16:48,100 --> 00:16:49,780
Okowa Lotus Leaf Wrap

264
00:16:57,740 --> 00:16:59,660
You've slowed down, so has Hosei-san

265
00:17:00,260 --> 00:17:02,640
This is pretty challenging

266
00:17:03,930 --> 00:17:07,420
Yama-chan you gotta eat more

267
00:17:10,610 --> 00:17:14,420
These dishes are at least different

268
00:17:24,410 --> 00:17:27,800
No more

269
00:17:30,480 --> 00:17:35,250
A fart is torture at this point

270
00:17:35,940 --> 00:17:41,860
With that, they've cleared 11 stores, 26 dishes, and eaten 10kg!

271
00:17:43,060 --> 00:17:45,860
Menu selection for the 12th store

272
00:17:46,520 --> 00:17:52,070
Large Yurinchi Chicken made with 2 types of sauces

273
00:17:52,070 --> 00:17:55,140
Ah Yurinchi? Large piece Yurinchi

274
00:17:55,140 --> 00:17:59,260
Slow Cooked Beef Stewed in Chinese Soy Sauce

275
00:17:59,260 --> 00:18:01,580
Don't fold it!

276
00:18:01,820 --> 00:18:03,900
Fried rice.

277
00:18:02,400 --> 00:18:03,900
There it is!

278
00:18:08,380 --> 00:18:10,450
Kimchee fried rice.

279
00:18:11,780 --> 00:18:16,380
It came!

280
00:18:16,380 --> 00:18:18,960
Double fried rice

281
00:18:20,040 --> 00:18:23,220
Finally, the double fried rice has appeared

282
00:18:24,310 --> 00:18:27,330
My stomach is pretty close to bursting

283
00:18:29,580 --> 00:18:33,420
Will I even be able to eat?

284
00:18:33,420 --> 00:18:36,640
How would you rate your stomach condition out of 10?

285
00:18:36,640 --> 00:18:40,810
I've already gone past that, it's been that way for a while

286
00:18:42,120 --> 00:18:46,220
But if nobody else gives up, I won't either

287
00:18:47,200 --> 00:18:51,860
These people have passed their limits - How will this end?!

288
00:18:54,260 --> 00:18:56,320
7.5 hours since the start

289
00:18:58,240 --> 00:19:00,240
Here we go

290
00:19:06,920 --> 00:19:10,540
The 12th store is Shinjuku West Gate's Large Guard location

291
00:19:12,250 --> 00:19:15,580
I can't go on

292
00:19:13,600 --> 00:19:15,580
You just said it!

293
00:19:26,260 --> 00:19:29,000
Alright, time for 4 dishes

294
00:19:29,000 --> 00:19:33,860
Thank you for the wait, this is the Slow Cooked Beef

295
00:19:45,240 --> 00:19:48,120
Please enjoy

296
00:19:50,780 --> 00:19:51,780
The next one,

297
00:19:52,080 --> 00:19:55,690
Here it comes! The fried rice

298
00:20:02,260 --> 00:20:03,760
Very nice!

299
00:20:05,830 --> 00:20:08,540
This is something you'd order the first time

300
00:20:09,800 --> 00:20:12,620
Well we haven't had fried rice yet

301
00:20:15,240 --> 00:20:17,740
How is it Hamada-san?

302
00:20:15,870 --> 00:20:19,740
It's great. It's a standard dish.

303
00:20:21,550 --> 00:20:25,620
The Yurinchi is very juicy

304
00:20:32,660 --> 00:20:35,400
They started off in high sprits,

305
00:20:47,360 --> 00:20:49,500
But now their chopsticks refuse to move

306
00:21:03,160 --> 00:21:07,060
We might get a 5-person give up for the first time

307
00:21:07,060 --> 00:21:08,710
Never seen before,

308
00:21:08,360 --> 00:21:12,400
Everyone but Fujiwara giving up

309
00:21:09,620 --> 00:21:12,000
You're right

310
00:21:19,670 --> 00:21:25,910
It's no longer a situation where one person breaks

311
00:21:29,260 --> 00:21:31,220
If everyone agrees,

312
00:21:31,220 --> 00:21:36,210
How about whoever has the most grams left loses?

313
00:21:37,690 --> 00:21:41,320
Whoever leaves behind the most loses?

314
00:21:42,260 --> 00:21:47,110
In the end, everyone but Fujiwara couldn't finish

315
00:21:48,020 --> 00:21:51,920
They decide the loser by measuring the leftovers' weights

316
00:21:53,060 --> 00:21:55,060
These 2 are the main issue right?

317
00:21:58,600 --> 00:22:00,380
Alright, starting with Hosei-san

318
00:22:03,380 --> 00:22:07,580
229 grams... Plus

319
00:22:10,160 --> 00:22:13,830
182 grams, for Hosei-san.

320
00:22:16,820 --> 00:22:19,480
I think I've lost this

321
00:22:19,480 --> 00:22:20,800
205 grams,

322
00:22:22,180 --> 00:22:23,300
Plus,

323
00:22:27,600 --> 00:22:29,670
218 grams.

324
00:22:30,530 --> 00:22:33,490
The rest of us have less?

325
00:22:32,840 --> 00:22:35,470
Well the quantity...

326
00:22:35,930 --> 00:22:39,910
Hold on, Hamada's is...

327
00:22:37,160 --> 00:22:39,910
Hamada-san's is suspect

328
00:22:41,360 --> 00:22:42,360
201 grams.

329
00:22:44,020 --> 00:22:45,660
201 and...

330
00:22:48,720 --> 00:22:51,230
215 grams.

331
00:22:54,670 --> 00:22:57,220
Time for the results,

332
00:22:57,220 --> 00:23:03,340
The person with the most loses right?

333
00:23:00,860 --> 00:23:03,340
Yes, it's their loss

334
00:23:03,340 --> 00:23:04,940
This time,

335
00:23:04,940 --> 00:23:06,940
These are the results!

336
00:23:12,540 --> 00:23:15,420
Oh no, hold on

337
00:23:15,420 --> 00:23:17,340
I hate this!

338
00:23:18,700 --> 00:23:20,840
It's not a large difference

339
00:23:20,840 --> 00:23:24,250
Just 7 grams

340
00:23:25,900 --> 00:23:27,800
He lost by 7 grams

341
00:23:29,120 --> 00:23:32,780
I don't wanna lose by 7 grams!

342
00:23:33,330 --> 00:23:37,020
With that, Matusmoto has to pay for everything

343
00:23:38,400 --> 00:23:40,620
What does 7 grams look like?

344
00:23:40,620 --> 00:23:44,580
Yeah, what does it look like

345
00:23:48,200 --> 00:23:49,640
There's five grams.

346
00:23:52,920 --> 00:23:54,800
Six grams... just a little more.

347
00:23:55,460 --> 00:23:56,460
Seven grams.

348
00:23:56,460 --> 00:23:59,440
This is how much he lost by

349
00:23:58,180 --> 00:24:00,470
It's one bite!

350
00:23:59,620 --> 00:24:02,690
It really is just one bite!

351
