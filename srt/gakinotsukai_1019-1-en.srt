00:00:00,510 --> 00:00:02,880
First time on Gaki No Tsukai,

00:00:02,880 --> 00:00:04,920
Sushizanmai Marathon 100.000 yen prize

00:00:05,240 --> 00:00:10,920
Tokyo 23 Wards, 31 Stores Total Challenge

4
00:00:11,770 --> 00:00:14,220
Thank you, this is our 3rd challenge,

5
00:00:14,220 --> 00:00:15,880
This is gonna be tough

6
00:00:15,320 --> 00:00:15,880
Yes.

7
00:00:15,880 --> 00:00:18,100
We had Gyoza,

8
00:00:18,100 --> 00:00:21,540
We had Gindako, and this time, it's Sushi

9
00:00:21,540 --> 00:00:23,880
This time let's get it

10
00:00:23,880 --> 00:00:27,100
Easy for you to say, we're the ones eating

11
00:00:27,100 --> 00:00:29,140
No no no

12
00:00:29,140 --> 00:00:33,560
Matsumoto-san is on a break right now, so this time,

13
00:00:33,560 --> 00:00:36,380
"Please!", "Please let me take part!"

14
00:00:37,580 --> 00:00:39,860
Amazing

15
00:00:38,420 --> 00:00:40,600
Did he really say that

16
00:00:40,600 --> 00:00:44,080
Let's introduce the special guest, let's welcome this person!

17
00:00:48,380 --> 00:00:49,580
Why?

18
00:00:48,580 --> 00:00:50,560
We're counting on you!

19
00:00:49,880 --> 00:00:51,640
Why Umemiya-san?

20
00:00:51,400 --> 00:00:57,700
SPECIAL GUEST:
Tatsuo Umemiya

21
00:00:54,700 --> 00:00:57,700
"Why Umemiya" you say,

22
00:00:58,220 --> 00:01:01,870
In the past, I took part in a food show,

23
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:01,870
Oh yeah you did

24
00:01:01,870 --> 00:01:04,540
Leave the eating to me

25
00:01:03,280 --> 00:01:04,540
Of course

26
00:01:04,540 --> 00:01:07,440
I'm a man

27
00:01:05,240 --> 00:01:07,440
But you were younger back then?

28
00:01:08,220 --> 00:01:09,760
In terms of capacity

29
00:01:10,140 --> 00:01:11,680
Doesn't matter!

30
00:01:13,850 --> 00:01:16,320
Don't comment on my age!

31
00:01:16,320 --> 00:01:18,520
Now that Umemiya-san is with you,

32
00:01:19,020 --> 00:01:23,310
The average age has become 48!

33
00:01:23,310 --> 00:01:25,310
It went up so high!

34
00:01:25,310 --> 00:01:27,310
No youngsters here

35
00:01:27,310 --> 00:01:29,400
FORTY EIGHT?

36
00:01:29,430 --> 00:01:36,920

00:01:29,430 --> 00:01:36,920

45
00:02:00,060 --> 00:02:07,180

48
00:02:20,540 --> 00:02:24,680
License: Near NTV, the first store, Shinbashi

49
00:02:25,540 --> 00:02:27,980
It's the first store, so let's get through it quickly

50
00:02:27,980 --> 00:02:29,680
Let's go

51
00:02:29,680 --> 00:02:31,680
Let's not take up too much time

52
00:02:32,720 --> 00:02:42,520
"No Laughing Hotel Man is on @ 00:00!"
"Website -> TV -> NTV -> Gaki no Tsukai"

53
00:02:33,620 --> 00:02:34,900
Let's go

54
00:02:46,200 --> 00:02:49,800
I'm so hungry

55
00:02:49,800 --> 00:02:52,730
I'm SO hungry

56
00:02:51,440 --> 00:02:52,730
So let's begin,

57
00:02:54,630 --> 00:02:56,780
Yama-chan, remember your words,

58
00:02:56,780 --> 00:03:00,480
I won't forget

59
00:02:57,660 --> 00:03:00,480
Don't give up at the 3rd store

60
00:03:00,490 --> 00:03:05,160
I'll go for 31 stores, I really wanna eat

61
00:03:05,900 --> 00:03:15,060
Narrator: Yamazaki is excited for the fat rich Otoro, starting off with Sushizanmai's special Tuna Set

62
00:03:15,060 --> 00:03:19,120
Narrator: Will these 5 finish the challenge for the first time?

63
00:03:19,340 --> 00:03:25,000
So, this is the first plate of the day

64
00:03:24,100 --> 00:03:25,780
Look delicious!

65
00:03:30,120 --> 00:03:32,380
So starting from the elderly

66
00:03:31,940 --> 00:03:34,780
Elderly?

67
00:03:33,040 --> 00:03:34,880
No no, I mean,

68
00:03:34,780 --> 00:03:36,780
Cause he's our senior

69
00:03:36,160 --> 00:03:38,300
I mean starting from the Senpai of course

70
00:03:38,300 --> 00:03:41,300
I'm very senior to you guys of course

71
00:03:41,330 --> 00:03:43,240
Any is good?

72
00:03:42,080 --> 00:03:43,460
Go ahead,

73
00:03:43,340 --> 00:03:44,580
Then, the Akami

74
00:03:44,820 --> 00:03:46,820
Ah of course

75
00:03:46,820 --> 00:03:49,630
So, excuse me,

76
00:03:47,860 --> 00:03:49,630
Oh, right

77
00:03:49,630 --> 00:03:53,600
Chu-toro!

78
00:03:51,200 --> 00:03:55,430
I wanna go for the fat rich ones early

79
00:03:53,600 --> 00:03:55,430
I see

80
00:03:57,160 --> 00:04:00,060
Alright, I'll get the fatty toro

81
00:04:00,060 --> 00:04:01,820
This is delicious!

82
00:04:02,200 --> 00:04:03,720
It's so good!

83
00:04:03,720 --> 00:04:06,120
I like this one

84
00:04:04,180 --> 00:04:06,120
Eh, that one?

85
00:04:07,860 --> 00:04:09,840
The Otoro and the rolls are still left

86
00:04:09,840 --> 00:04:11,620
Tanaka you can have both

87
00:04:11,260 --> 00:04:12,640
But still

88
00:04:13,440 --> 00:04:15,500
What? This is your chance

89
00:04:16,620 --> 00:04:17,680
It's really good

90
00:04:19,530 --> 00:04:22,520
Can't we just call this lunch and end here?

91
00:04:22,520 --> 00:04:24,520
That would be a simple fun TV show

92
00:04:25,120 --> 00:04:26,720
It's so good

93
00:04:26,720 --> 00:04:29,240
But still, these are still left

94
00:04:29,240 --> 00:04:31,440
Then Endo can eat them

95
00:04:30,340 --> 00:04:31,440
Really? OK

96
00:04:31,720 --> 00:04:33,640
I'll eat one for now

97
00:04:34,350 --> 00:04:37,870
Eating 3 is good too

98
00:04:35,400 --> 00:04:37,870
Oh, but that's... everyone?

99
00:04:36,920 --> 00:04:37,960
3 is one serving

100
00:04:37,870 --> 00:04:40,960
Why are you guys already calculating at the first store?

101
00:04:40,440 --> 00:04:43,540
Endo is like Gaki's "Top Batter"

102
00:04:44,240 --> 00:04:47,960
Yeah he is, on this show

103
00:04:48,160 --> 00:04:49,060
Go ahead

104
00:04:50,160 --> 00:04:52,700
It's still the first store after all

105
00:04:56,080 --> 00:04:57,500
OK everyone, let's continue

106
00:04:57,400 --> 00:05:00,600
Let's go to the next store

107
00:04:57,600 --> 00:04:59,000
Yummy, yummy

108
00:04:59,400 --> 00:05:00,580
It's tasty

109
00:05:00,600 --> 00:05:02,700
This is easy

110
00:05:01,820 --> 00:05:07,650
Shinbashi-ten store was a piece of cake,
They aim for the next store, in Roppongi, Hayuzamae location

111
00:05:07,980 --> 00:05:12,470
Licence? This is too easy

112
00:05:10,540 --> 00:05:12,120
Really?
It's too easy?

113
00:05:12,470 --> 00:05:13,570
Sorry, sorry

114
00:05:13,570 --> 00:05:17,590
You might just end up broadcasting us having a nice meal

115
00:05:16,080 --> 00:05:17,260
Yeah

116
00:05:17,590 --> 00:05:20,630
There's no conflict

117
00:05:18,940 --> 00:05:20,080
There's no obstacles

118
00:05:19,620 --> 00:05:20,560
No obstacles

119
00:05:20,630 --> 00:05:23,860
But right now I really wanna eat

120
00:05:23,240 --> 00:05:26,460
Yeah, of course, we've only been to one store

121
00:05:26,460 --> 00:05:29,100
Soon we'll arrive at the second store

122
00:05:30,100 --> 00:05:34,600
OK, this is the Roppongi intersection, we're almost there

123
00:05:33,380 --> 00:05:34,880
Yippee! Roppongi!

124
00:05:35,100 --> 00:05:37,940
Let's breeze through this one

125
00:05:36,420 --> 00:05:37,860
Yes

126
00:05:37,040 --> 00:05:37,960
Let's go

127
00:05:39,080 --> 00:05:43,040
It's here. Thank you.

128
00:05:43,050 --> 00:05:47,460
Here it comes!

129
00:05:48,150 --> 00:05:51,230
I'll get the fatty ones, I'm quite hungry

130
00:05:54,300 --> 00:05:56,900
Ah, I get that choice

131
00:05:57,540 --> 00:06:01,760
Fatty Toro

132
00:05:59,670 --> 00:06:01,470
You're going for it Hosei-san

133
00:06:01,000 --> 00:06:03,470
That's your second time!

134
00:06:03,470 --> 00:06:04,720
In a row

135
00:06:03,470 --> 00:06:04,720
cause it was delicious

136
00:06:04,720 --> 00:06:06,520
So well, uhh

137
00:06:06,520 --> 00:06:08,460
Delicious!

138
00:06:08,580 --> 00:06:09,480
So,

139
00:06:09,480 --> 00:06:11,320
The Akami

140
00:06:13,020 --> 00:06:15,020
What should we do with this

141
00:06:15,420 --> 00:06:17,020
I'll have 1 for now

142
00:06:17,590 --> 00:06:21,100
But you told us you were hungry

143
00:06:18,400 --> 00:06:20,060
Yup, you did

144
00:06:21,100 --> 00:06:26,040
It'll mess up my pace, pushing on needlessly is no good

145
00:06:26,040 --> 00:06:30,080
What happened? What happened at this sushi lunch?

146
00:06:28,560 --> 00:06:31,680
He's so different from the last place

147
00:06:30,080 --> 00:06:31,740
Why, before this Sushi?

148
00:06:33,130 --> 00:06:35,130
Please go ahead

149
00:06:39,100 --> 00:06:42,740
We ate last time, and I already know how it tastes

150
00:06:41,360 --> 00:06:42,740
But of course, the senpais...

151
00:06:42,740 --> 00:06:44,740
Yes that's good, you can taste it

152
00:06:44,740 --> 00:06:49,080
You can have it, I am you junior of course

153
00:06:49,080 --> 00:06:51,080
OK!

154
00:06:53,180 --> 00:06:56,520
So easy, god damn. We can totally do this.

155
00:06:56,880 --> 00:06:59,580
I'm so hungry~

156
00:06:59,580 --> 00:07:05,160
Everyone manages to finish
They head to a store nearby, also in Roppongi

157
00:07:05,160 --> 00:07:07,120
Let's go in.

158
00:07:07,120 --> 00:07:09,040
Sorry for the wait,

159
00:07:12,890 --> 00:07:16,100
I had Akami last time right

160
00:07:16,100 --> 00:07:18,100
Ah, chu-toro!

161
00:07:18,460 --> 00:07:20,100
Ahhh,

162
00:07:21,340 --> 00:07:25,940
Yama-chan always takes this. (Aburi)

163
00:07:26,070 --> 00:07:28,220
I'll take the ootoro.

164
00:07:31,320 --> 00:07:34,340
The Akami

165
00:07:34,340 --> 00:07:36,700
The Negitoro

166
00:07:36,700 --> 00:07:38,490
Just these left

167
00:07:38,490 --> 00:07:40,500
So what shall we do here?

168
00:07:40,500 --> 00:07:44,000
You didn't eat these last time right?

169
00:07:42,140 --> 00:07:44,000
I did not, yes

170
00:07:44,000 --> 00:07:46,940
Ok, excuse me,

171
00:07:46,940 --> 00:07:50,240
Well it's still the 3rd store, can I have this?

172
00:07:50,780 --> 00:07:52,870
So Hosei-san will

173
00:07:52,870 --> 00:07:56,380
Endo

174
00:07:54,280 --> 00:07:56,380
Alright, no problem look

175
00:07:56,380 --> 00:07:58,380
It's a big piece

176
00:07:59,480 --> 00:08:04,350
It's no problem

177
00:08:00,880 --> 00:08:04,350
This is easy

178
00:08:05,110 --> 00:08:08,700
This is a good pace huh

179
00:08:08,700 --> 00:08:10,900
This is going pretty well

180
00:08:12,540 --> 00:08:17,280
A good 3rd store
I think when we did Takoyaki the 3rd store was already...

181
00:08:18,020 --> 00:08:20,550
We were forcing through it

182
00:08:21,380 --> 00:08:27,470
Making good progress till now, they head into the Ginza 7-chome store

183
00:08:31,880 --> 00:08:33,270
Mm!  Delicious!

184
00:08:35,070 --> 00:08:37,370
Everyone gulps down the Tuna,

185
00:08:37,880 --> 00:08:41,210
But the fatty sushi eating Yamazaki,

186
00:08:41,210 --> 00:08:42,860
starts to feel a little worried

187
00:08:43,580 --> 00:08:44,860
Finished!

188
00:08:44,860 --> 00:08:46,120
OK we did it

189
00:08:46,120 --> 00:08:47,360
Let's go!

190
00:08:46,740 --> 00:08:48,920
OK, OK, this is easy

191
00:08:48,900 --> 00:08:52,920
2 minutes till we get there, Yurakucho store

192
00:08:54,920 --> 00:09:00,330
Right beside this hotel, let's go
5th store, Yurakucho

193
00:09:00,330 --> 00:09:05,100
We can make it to the next one, the next one for sure

194
00:09:07,280 --> 00:09:08,280
That was fast.

195
00:09:09,700 --> 00:09:12,060
Which one have I not eaten yet

196
00:09:12,060 --> 00:09:16,300
Tatsuo-nii, you haven't eaten this right?

197
00:09:13,600 --> 00:09:16,300
Aburi.

198
00:09:15,700 --> 00:09:17,310
Then I'll have that

199
00:09:17,310 --> 00:09:18,840
He got the Aburi

200
00:09:19,550 --> 00:09:21,890
I'm going for the Akami

201
00:09:20,860 --> 00:09:22,920
I'm taking the ootoro, haven't had it yet

202
00:09:22,920 --> 00:09:25,120
I'll have the chu-toro.

203
00:09:27,640 --> 00:09:31,320
Now, Yamazaki, who has his first Akami, utters these words,

204
00:09:31,320 --> 00:09:35,300
Hold on, eating the Aburi, twice in a row,

205
00:09:35,300 --> 00:09:37,200
It's heavier than I expected

206
00:09:37,200 --> 00:09:41,180
It's delicious, but more than I thought, but it's still...

207
00:09:41,370 --> 00:09:47,000
While Yamasaki voices his concerns, Tanaka finishes the three rolls by himself

208
00:09:47,350 --> 00:09:48,360
Rolls OK

209
00:09:48,360 --> 00:09:52,600
Finished!

210
00:09:53,220 --> 00:10:02,440
Until now, Hamada and Tetsuo have had a balanced selection, but Yamasaki has been eating fatty sush, like Aburi-toro & Otoro

211
00:10:03,360 --> 00:10:06,840
They head to the 6th store, AKIBA location

212
00:10:07,840 --> 00:10:09,440
But then,

213
00:10:09,530 --> 00:10:10,300
Of course

214
00:10:11,940 --> 00:10:19,220
You can't keep eating the Aburi, Chutoro, and Otoro

215
00:10:17,240 --> 00:10:19,220
The Aburi gets you

216
00:10:18,060 --> 00:10:20,040
You have to plan it out

217
00:10:20,640 --> 00:10:25,000
Sometimes there's oil on the plate

218
00:10:25,000 --> 00:10:27,360
I get chills when I see that

219
00:10:27,450 --> 00:10:32,000
And yet, you ate it like 2 to 3 times in a row

220
00:10:32,000 --> 00:10:34,760
"Delicious!" "This is delicious!"

221
00:10:33,840 --> 00:10:34,760
He did say that

222
00:10:34,760 --> 00:10:38,280
And suddenly he switched to the Akami!

223
00:10:36,880 --> 00:10:38,280
That's where it started

224
00:10:38,280 --> 00:10:44,040
I'm not making excuses or anything like that, I like Akami

225
00:10:43,120 --> 00:10:46,780
If XXXX was here, he'd kill you where you stand

226
00:10:46,780 --> 00:10:50,600
"This fucker, switching from this to that"

227
00:10:50,600 --> 00:10:54,050
"This conniving bastard!"

228
00:10:56,920 --> 00:11:01,560
Since it seems nobody wants to choose the fatty sushi, a new rule is introduced

229
00:11:02,270 --> 00:11:07,580
If all 5 members choose a seperate card, they can eat whatever they chose

230
00:11:08,270 --> 00:11:13,560
But if anyone matches, there will be 1 extra Sushi to eat of that type

231
00:11:14,440 --> 00:11:18,480
They arrive at AKIBA. Whatever will happen?

232
00:11:18,480 --> 00:11:22,060
It's best not to match right?

233
00:11:19,780 --> 00:11:22,060
It's better not to match

234
00:11:22,060 --> 00:11:25,360
Please go ahead and choose,

235
00:11:25,360 --> 00:11:31,340
I don't really get it, I'll do this once, and then complain later

236
00:11:29,060 --> 00:11:31,340
Please don't complain

237
00:11:31,340 --> 00:11:34,780
So choose which one you want to eat, but don't match

238
00:11:34,780 --> 00:11:38,640
So you might have to consider what other people might choose as well

239
00:11:38,640 --> 00:11:40,640
I see

240
00:11:40,640 --> 00:11:42,780
It's like a game almost

241
00:11:44,400 --> 00:11:45,860
We flip on "Ready, go" right?

242
00:11:45,120 --> 00:11:48,340
Yup. Everyone has chosen, so let's go,

243
00:11:49,110 --> 00:11:50,610
Ready....go!

244
00:11:51,880 --> 00:11:56,380
Aburi-toro

245
00:11:51,880 --> 00:11:56,380
Akami

246
00:11:51,880 --> 00:11:56,380
Akami

247
00:11:51,880 --> 00:11:56,380
Chutoro

248
00:11:51,880 --> 00:11:56,380
Otoro

249
00:11:53,660 --> 00:11:55,660
Yama-chan!

250
00:11:56,380 --> 00:12:00,500
Wait Hamada-san you've eaten this already!

251
00:12:02,580 --> 00:12:03,820
Wow there's two of them

252
00:12:04,120 --> 00:12:06,460
Consequently, the Negitoro is still left

253
00:12:08,320 --> 00:12:13,390
Cause I keep eating them, it's starting to take a toll

254
00:12:13,550 --> 00:12:16,510
So the Negi-toro, everyone can decide,

255
00:12:16,510 --> 00:12:17,800
Who's gonna eat it?

256
00:12:18,020 --> 00:12:19,590
It's OK to go ahead

257
00:12:19,590 --> 00:12:21,560
Alright then, I'll have it

258
00:12:24,190 --> 00:12:28,000
Does the Senpai wish to-

259
00:12:25,060 --> 00:12:28,000
No that's alright, Iater, later,

260
00:12:28,350 --> 00:12:30,910
Still have plenty of time

261
00:12:31,140 --> 00:12:32,880
Here, Endo will eat it.

262
00:12:33,080 --> 00:12:35,080
It hits you all of a sudden

263
00:12:39,800 --> 00:12:42,720
The next store is at the top of this building

264
00:12:40,960 --> 00:12:42,780
Really?

265
00:12:46,400 --> 00:12:47,960
We'll go upstairs here

266
00:12:47,960 --> 00:12:50,720
Ah this thing? Sushizanmai

267
00:12:50,990 --> 00:12:54,920
This is a revolving sushi

268
00:12:55,920 --> 00:13:02,240
Even though they just finished the 6th store,
They soon reach Akiba's revolving Sushizanmai

269
00:13:04,200 --> 00:13:09,500
Here, the newly introduced rule brings suffering to the 5!

270
00:13:09,640 --> 00:13:10,780
Well, for now,

271
00:13:10,780 --> 00:13:12,960
For now, make your choice,

272
00:13:12,960 --> 00:13:17,380
(They are all saying "Don't match the cards")

273
00:13:17,380 --> 00:13:19,380
This is also teamwork

274
00:13:19,840 --> 00:13:21,380
I don't wanna match

275
00:13:21,380 --> 00:13:23,380
So choose please,

276
00:13:23,380 --> 00:13:26,380
Here we go......ready, flip!

277
00:13:27,660 --> 00:13:33,240
Akami and Aburitoro matched!

278
00:13:33,240 --> 00:13:36,360
Hamada-san! That's...

279
00:13:36,360 --> 00:13:38,740
You gotta cut it out man

280
00:13:38,740 --> 00:13:42,780
Matching as a duo is the worst

281
00:13:39,640 --> 00:13:42,780
We matched as a duo

282
00:13:43,160 --> 00:13:45,800
There's gonna be a lot left on the plate

283
00:13:45,800 --> 00:13:47,500
Two of each of those

284
00:13:46,820 --> 00:13:48,340
Cause they matched

285
00:13:48,340 --> 00:13:50,340
That one and that one?

286
00:13:50,740 --> 00:13:52,590
Uwahh, I see

287
00:13:52,590 --> 00:13:58,180
Why don't you feed us this stuff, so much variety

288
00:13:58,180 --> 00:14:00,870
We wanna try other stuff too

289
00:14:00,870 --> 00:14:03,720
Negitoro.......ootoro....

290
00:14:05,720 --> 00:14:07,720
Woah, there's a lot

291
00:14:09,420 --> 00:14:11,140
Please, dig in

292
00:14:09,500 --> 00:14:11,450
This is Aburi?

293
00:14:11,450 --> 00:14:14,940
So I'll have this Akami

294
00:14:14,940 --> 00:14:17,940
It seems the Otoro and Negitoro will be left over

295
00:14:17,940 --> 00:14:19,640
I can eat whenever

296
00:14:19,640 --> 00:14:22,060
Ah, OK then

297
00:14:21,100 --> 00:14:22,580
Can you eat them please?

298
00:14:22,360 --> 00:14:24,060
There's too much this time

299
00:14:22,940 --> 00:14:24,060
It's tiny!

300
00:14:24,340 --> 00:14:25,180
That one?

301
00:14:24,900 --> 00:14:27,640
Even though the Negitoro was closer to him

302
00:14:27,780 --> 00:14:29,540
He ignored that area

303
00:14:28,740 --> 00:14:31,680
Then I'll also have this

304
00:14:35,760 --> 00:14:37,060
Oh he's got the Negitoro!

305
00:14:37,860 --> 00:14:38,880
The Negitoro too?

306
00:14:39,860 --> 00:14:42,800
The teamwork is good here
Amazing teamwork

307
00:14:42,800 --> 00:14:46,360
You guys are supporting each other

308
00:14:44,200 --> 00:14:46,360
We can do it if we work hard

309
00:14:47,100 --> 00:14:51,340
On the way back to the bus, Hamada's senility acts up

310
00:14:51,900 --> 00:14:54,400
We didn't go to this Sushizanmai?

311
00:14:54,830 --> 00:14:57,230
We were just here. Hamada-san?

312
00:14:59,020 --> 00:15:01,840
It's that

313
00:15:00,020 --> 00:15:01,780
The root

314
00:15:02,180 --> 00:15:05,880
The trial, we need to put him on trial

315
00:15:05,980 --> 00:15:08,140
Double. Right now was a double.

316
00:15:08,140 --> 00:15:09,420
What else happened?

317
00:15:09,290 --> 00:15:12,520
"We didn't go here?"

318
00:15:13,620 --> 00:15:16,320
He's getting the death penalty

319
00:15:16,550 --> 00:15:21,000
"We should go here" he said as he tripped on the root

320
00:15:21,420 --> 00:15:26,500
We didn't go to this Sushizanmai?

321
00:15:24,390 --> 00:15:26,500
We were just here. Hamda-san?

322
00:15:29,500 --> 00:15:36,360
On the way to the 8th store in Ueno, Hamada complains about the harsh rules

323
00:15:36,360 --> 00:15:40,830
Give everyone cards separately

324
00:15:40,120 --> 00:15:42,330
That's right

325
00:15:40,830 --> 00:15:44,980
That way, we only have to worry about what's leftover

326
00:15:44,980 --> 00:15:47,140
Endo-san, you're still fine?

327
00:15:46,080 --> 00:15:48,280
Totally fine

328
00:15:47,860 --> 00:15:48,980
Tanaka-san?

329
00:15:48,420 --> 00:15:49,360
Easy, so easy

330
00:15:50,420 --> 00:15:52,000
Umemiya-san?

331
00:15:52,000 --> 00:15:56,250
Well since you guys added that matching game,

332
00:15:57,160 --> 00:16:01,840
And because of that, I'm losing confidence if we can make it to 30 stores

333
00:16:01,840 --> 00:16:05,450
So that means, that's your trick,

334
00:16:05,450 --> 00:16:08,560
You guys are making it harder for us to get the 100,000 yen

335
00:16:07,480 --> 00:16:08,480
Exactly

336
00:16:08,480 --> 00:16:09,760
It's Obvious!

337
00:16:09,060 --> 00:16:10,240
It's obvious!

338
00:16:13,560 --> 00:16:19,820
With the team unity solidified, they reach the 8th store in Ueno, near Ueno Park

339
00:16:20,500 --> 00:16:27,800
This delicious looking sushi, Aburi-toro and Otoro with plenty of fat
Who will eat it this time?

340
00:16:27,800 --> 00:16:30,800
I will NOT match

341
00:16:32,510 --> 00:16:35,070
Alright I'm ready, if it's this

342
00:16:35,070 --> 00:16:35,940
That was quick

343
00:16:35,940 --> 00:16:40,940
I've already decided, I decided on the bus

344
00:16:40,940 --> 00:16:42,740
If mine matches it's gonna suck

345
00:16:44,060 --> 00:16:45,310
Ready....flip!

346
00:16:46,220 --> 00:16:49,960
Negi-toro, negi-toro, aburi-toro, aburi-toro, and Akami

347
00:16:49,960 --> 00:16:53,500
You haven't changed it all!

348
00:16:51,400 --> 00:16:53,500
Hosei!

349
00:16:53,500 --> 00:16:56,080
He thought someone would eat the Chutoro

350
00:16:55,160 --> 00:17:01,960
Are you trying to take it easy by eating lean meat?

351
00:17:02,970 --> 00:17:04,600
No it's not like that,

352
00:17:05,200 --> 00:17:08,600
Honestly, I am kind of feeling full now

353
00:17:09,110 --> 00:17:11,160
This thing, this Aburi-toro

354
00:17:11,160 --> 00:17:14,000
They're already ready

355
00:17:19,320 --> 00:17:22,220
So everyone, eat what you're supposed to

356
00:17:22,430 --> 00:17:26,910
So Umemiya-san and I have to finish these ones

357
00:17:26,910 --> 00:17:28,600
There's so many

358
00:17:28,600 --> 00:17:30,540
Lots of Chu-toro and Otoro

359
00:17:30,540 --> 00:17:34,000
With the remainder, if everyone eats 1 piece that'll work out nicely

360
00:17:34,910 --> 00:17:36,650
Should I go for 1 Negi-toro?

361
00:17:36,660 --> 00:17:37,840
Go ahead

362
00:17:37,400 --> 00:17:39,540
Really?

363
00:17:37,840 --> 00:17:39,540
Yes, go ahead

364
00:17:40,640 --> 00:17:44,080
TN: Hosei ate the smaller roll that isn't Negi-toro

365
00:17:41,370 --> 00:17:45,110
OH, he already ate it!

366
00:17:44,700 --> 00:17:46,280
He ate it, and then looked

367
00:17:46,090 --> 00:17:48,520
All you do is try to take it easy

368
00:17:48,520 --> 00:17:51,440
Fine, I'll go for this

369
00:17:51,800 --> 00:17:53,480
And there's one left of those

370
00:17:52,320 --> 00:17:54,840
I got it, I understand

371
00:17:54,560 --> 00:17:56,200
You can still eat?

372
00:17:55,720 --> 00:17:57,220
Absolutely

373
00:17:58,500 --> 00:18:01,740
OK, finished!

374
00:18:02,660 --> 00:18:07,860
So they head from Ueno to the 9th store in Asakusa

375
00:18:07,990 --> 00:18:11,530
So I just heard some information,

376
00:18:12,860 --> 00:18:17,680
Umemiya-san, your dad was a doctor?

377
00:18:18,930 --> 00:18:21,300
Yup

378
00:18:19,200 --> 00:18:21,000
Eh? Really?

379
00:18:21,500 --> 00:18:26,640
My dad is a doctor, I don't think that's very special though

380
00:18:25,020 --> 00:18:27,180
Did he want you to follow his footsteps?

381
00:18:26,640 --> 00:18:28,880
Well yes, at first

382
00:18:28,880 --> 00:18:33,180
I told him, "Just 1 year"

383
00:18:33,180 --> 00:18:34,620
To enter this business

384
00:18:35,040 --> 00:18:37,180
And 1 year passed,

385
00:18:37,180 --> 00:18:38,700
I thought of quitting,

386
00:18:38,820 --> 00:18:42,000
It was almost time to fulfill my promise,

387
00:18:42,000 --> 00:18:47,120
But you did as you pleased

388
00:18:43,100 --> 00:18:47,120
In the end though, I selfishly kept going

389
00:18:47,130 --> 00:18:52,780
Selfish?

390
00:18:49,380 --> 00:18:52,780
I mean, in that situation, by that point

391
00:18:52,780 --> 00:18:57,150
When you're on a boat at sea, you can do whatever you want!

392
00:18:55,240 --> 00:18:57,920
Whatever you want? Could you give an example

393
00:18:58,540 --> 00:19:00,840
"If you're on a boat you can do anything"

394
00:19:00,840 --> 00:19:03,740
I was invited onto a Cruiser-style boat,

395
00:19:00,840 --> 00:19:03,740
TN: I may have missed the joke here

396
00:19:03,740 --> 00:19:08,320
A girl came on board saying "Hiiii!",
and she was prepared

397
00:19:08,320 --> 00:19:10,080
What do you mean by that

398
00:19:09,920 --> 00:19:12,900
They get on board understanding everything

399
00:19:14,800 --> 00:19:23,600
The fatty Aburi-toro and Otoro are hitting like a Body Blow
They head into the Asakusa store, near Asakusa Engei Hall

400
00:19:25,800 --> 00:19:27,800
What you want to eat,

401
00:19:29,350 --> 00:19:31,300
Choose please

402
00:19:31,680 --> 00:19:35,030
That was quick

403
00:19:32,100 --> 00:19:35,290
Yeah it was

404
00:19:35,860 --> 00:19:37,300
Hosei-san?

405
00:19:39,520 --> 00:19:43,940
Let's go!  Ready..........flip.

406
00:19:44,600 --> 00:19:49,250
Otoro, Akami... The Akami matched! Who is it?

407
00:19:48,320 --> 00:19:49,300
These two

408
00:19:50,250 --> 00:19:52,660
Can someone do something about him?

409
00:19:52,660 --> 00:19:54,120
He doesn't change it

410
00:19:54,120 --> 00:19:56,960
Cut it out already please

411
00:19:55,160 --> 00:19:57,300
Let go of the Akami!

412
00:20:00,160 --> 00:20:03,340
Us three could have been consecutive

413
00:20:01,120 --> 00:20:04,500
Yeah you're right, it would have made a good continuation

414
00:20:04,000 --> 00:20:08,060
It should have ended with the Negitoro

415
00:20:05,540 --> 00:20:08,060
Yeah exactly

416
00:20:08,060 --> 00:20:13,520
So 4th time these two have matched on Akami. Right?

417
00:20:14,380 --> 00:20:18,120
And ... Endo-san you had Aburi?

418
00:20:18,120 --> 00:20:21,220
This is Chutoro

419
00:20:19,420 --> 00:20:21,220
I'll take the oo-toro.

420
00:20:21,820 --> 00:20:24,520
Hamada-san got the tekka-maki.
Oh! Hosei-san got it too!

421
00:20:24,900 --> 00:20:27,440
He feels guilty

422
00:20:27,520 --> 00:20:29,220
I'll go

423
00:20:29,220 --> 00:20:31,520
I'll go

424
00:20:29,800 --> 00:20:31,520
Negitoro for Tanaka-san

425
00:20:32,280 --> 00:20:34,740
Amazing. The power of Friendship

426
00:20:35,400 --> 00:20:38,000
Ugh, I hate Yama-chan

427
00:20:38,000 --> 00:20:39,560
I will not match anymore

428
00:20:39,180 --> 00:20:42,110
That's cause ... I got it

429
00:20:42,110 --> 00:20:46,890
If you got what you wanted, next time,

430
00:20:46,890 --> 00:20:51,810
You have to choose a different one

431
00:20:49,540 --> 00:20:51,810
That's good

432
00:20:51,200 --> 00:20:51,810
Yup

433
00:20:51,810 --> 00:20:54,560
I think that's good, Hosei-san please,

434
00:20:53,580 --> 00:20:54,560
No, I

435
00:20:54,560 --> 00:20:57,860
I literally, shuffle the cards and pull one out

436
00:20:58,230 --> 00:21:00,030
I don't think that's right

437
00:21:00,030 --> 00:21:04,540
You should be choosing the card

438
00:21:00,900 --> 00:21:02,560
You should think about it

439
00:21:01,960 --> 00:21:04,540
You have to pick something different

440
00:21:04,540 --> 00:21:10,400
That way, when we choose seperate cards, it'll feel good right?

441
00:21:06,960 --> 00:21:08,880
The taste will change too

442
00:21:11,520 --> 00:21:18,600
Near by the Skytree which is under construction, they arrive at Kinshicho

443
00:21:18,600 --> 00:21:22,990
This time, they don't want to match,

444
00:21:22,990 --> 00:21:24,580
Everyone, we're here.

445
00:21:25,250 --> 00:21:27,510
Lets pick different cards from last time

446
00:21:27,680 --> 00:21:29,840
I'm gonna shuffle

447
00:21:29,820 --> 00:21:32,420
Can you judge his shuffling

448
00:21:32,760 --> 00:21:35,980
I'm shuffling for real

449
00:21:35,980 --> 00:21:39,040
If it's Akami, it's not my fault OK

450
00:21:39,040 --> 00:21:41,040
Alright. Have you chosen?

451
00:21:44,320 --> 00:21:45,850
Okay then, let's go

452
00:21:54,660 --> 00:22:00,700
We even tried, to differentiate it

453
00:21:58,700 --> 00:22:00,700
Ahh damn, this is how it turned out

454
00:22:01,840 --> 00:22:07,360
But still, it's one additional per match

455
00:22:05,580 --> 00:22:07,360
But the Otoro,

456
00:22:07,870 --> 00:22:11,880
Aburi, and the rolls will be left

457
00:22:16,460 --> 00:22:18,600
I'm really full

458
00:22:19,280 --> 00:22:21,450
He said, totally said it

459
00:22:21,450 --> 00:22:27,280
Yama-chan... C'mon man!
You said you were hungry

460
00:22:24,960 --> 00:22:27,280
Make me work hard

461
00:22:27,280 --> 00:22:29,720
What do you mean "Make me work hard"
Just do it

462
00:22:29,880 --> 00:22:33,180
(selecting the sushi from the card)

463
00:22:32,160 --> 00:22:37,560
The Negitoro matched three times, but it's only increased by 1

464
00:22:37,560 --> 00:22:38,920
I haven't eaten Negitoro

465
00:22:39,380 --> 00:22:40,920
Oh, in that case,

466
00:22:41,340 --> 00:22:43,140
Mmm, it's good

467
00:22:42,420 --> 00:22:44,140
Tanaka-san?

468
00:22:43,900 --> 00:22:44,900
This Aburi

469
00:22:44,040 --> 00:22:45,880
This, this roll

470
00:22:46,120 --> 00:22:48,000
I'll get the roll as well

471
00:22:49,240 --> 00:22:50,520
Hamada-san got 2

472
00:22:51,930 --> 00:22:56,630
If you keep this up, you will surely recieve heavenly punishment

473
00:22:55,640 --> 00:22:58,860
Do you remember the Yama-chan daruma gag?

474
00:23:00,280 --> 00:23:04,220
That's good, they're laughing, it's the Yama-chan Daruma

475
00:23:05,500 --> 00:23:06,780
Thank you very much

476
00:23:06,780 --> 00:23:08,780
I did good here, right?

477
00:23:07,880 --> 00:23:10,200
Alright, I got it,

478
00:23:10,200 --> 00:23:12,940
I'll help you out as much as I can

479
00:23:13,420 --> 00:23:15,360
Thank you very much

480
00:23:16,040 --> 00:23:19,640
You're so different now from before!

481
00:23:19,640 --> 00:23:22,500
You should be helping him out!

482
00:23:22,500 --> 00:23:25,420
Well, if he wants to help me...

483
00:23:25,420 --> 00:23:27,800
Just for a little bit, let me take a break

484
00:23:27,140 --> 00:23:28,440
Break?!

485
00:23:27,800 --> 00:23:32,100
I, I will still take part of course, but ,

486
00:23:33,220 --> 00:23:35,880
What the hell are you saying?

487
00:23:37,150 --> 00:23:42,760
Next week, they head towards Tsukiji

488
00:23:43,240 --> 00:23:48,420
The 5 head towards a Tuna butchering!

489
00:23:55,040 --> 00:23:58,040
And finally, their stomachs at the limit

490
00:23:58,540 --> 00:24:04,340
Will they be able to finish?
