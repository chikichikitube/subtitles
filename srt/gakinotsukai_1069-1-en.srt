1
00:00:00,450 --> 00:00:02,720
First time ever on Gaki no Tsukai ya Arahende:

2
00:00:02,720 --> 00:00:05,400
Yakiniku Toraji

3
00:00:05,400 --> 00:00:08,620
TN: The Yamanote line is a loop around Tokyo.

4
00:00:05,400 --> 00:00:08,620
Yamanote-line 25 store challenge!

5
00:00:11,360 --> 00:00:14,220
This is our fourth time!

6
00:00:14,740 --> 00:00:18,960
We gotta finish this one.

7
00:00:15,680 --> 00:00:18,960
Yes. We've never finished one before.

8
00:00:18,960 --> 00:00:22,540
That's true.

9
00:00:22,540 --> 00:00:25,030
Have any of you been to Toraji?

10
00:00:23,840 --> 00:00:25,740
I've been to Toraji.

11
00:00:25,740 --> 00:00:29,800
Hamada-san?

12
00:00:26,320 --> 00:00:29,800
No, I haven't been.

13
00:00:30,040 --> 00:00:32,060
You know, I've heard,

14
00:00:32,060 --> 00:00:34,960
out of all the eating episodes we've done,

15
00:00:34,960 --> 00:00:38,660
there hasn't been much excitement.

16
00:00:38,660 --> 00:00:47,060
But I've heard, this guy is just insane about yakiniku.

17
00:00:43,960 --> 00:00:47,060
Don't just make stuff up!

18
00:00:47,060 --> 00:00:53,010
He gets extremely excited over yakiniku.

19
00:00:50,220 --> 00:00:51,660
I'm looking forward to that.

20
00:00:53,010 --> 00:00:56,160
The base is different.

21
00:00:54,320 --> 00:00:56,160
Shut up! What do you mean "base"?

22
00:00:56,160 --> 00:00:57,520
His appreciation.

23
00:00:57,520 --> 00:01:00,620
He is, Mister Meat.

24
00:01:00,620 --> 00:01:02,840
I've heard that a lot.

25
00:01:03,120 --> 00:01:07,100
At the planning meeting he always says "Let's do Yakiniku"
"GAHAH GAHAHA"

26
00:01:07,100 --> 00:01:09,960
When he heard about this episode,

27
00:01:09,960 --> 00:01:13,800
He stood up on his seat and went like this.

28
00:01:13,800 --> 00:01:18,160
He was towering above the table.

29
00:01:15,640 --> 00:01:18,160
Who told you this?

00:01:30,920 --> 00:01:36,140
Food Marathon #4: Yakiniku Challenge

32
00:01:36,620 --> 00:01:40,380
Starting at Ginza 8-chome, they aim for 25th store at Shiodome.

33
00:01:40,820 --> 00:01:46,660
At each store, they choose from 1 dish from 25, and work together to finish to proceed.

34
00:01:47,240 --> 00:01:52,600
If they finish the challenge, they win 100,000 yen!

35
00:01:54,120 --> 00:02:01,300
But if anyone gives up, they must pay for everything eaten so far.

36
00:02:02,300 --> 00:02:03,580
We're almost there.

37
00:02:03,580 --> 00:02:05,750
Ehh?!

38
00:02:07,440 --> 00:02:08,860
This way.

39
00:02:08,860 --> 00:02:10,440
The first store.

40
00:02:12,900 --> 00:02:14,440
'Morning

41
00:02:14,440 --> 00:02:16,740
This was close by.

42
00:02:16,820 --> 00:02:20,300
They've failed 3 food marathons before,

43
00:02:20,300 --> 00:02:23,380
Will they finish for the first time?

44
00:02:23,380 --> 00:02:25,380
What dish will you start with?

45
00:02:25,380 --> 00:02:30,680
Actually, let's try #9
Thick cut beef tongue.

46
00:02:30,680 --> 00:02:34,000
I see!

47
00:02:34,440 --> 00:02:40,040
They decide on thick cut beef tongue for their first dish.

48
00:02:40,040 --> 00:02:41,360
It's here.

49
00:02:41,740 --> 00:02:43,120
It's quick, as expected.

50
00:02:43,120 --> 00:02:46,240
Thick cut beef tongue is here.

51
00:02:46,240 --> 00:02:47,660
They're big.

52
00:02:47,660 --> 00:02:48,840
There's one extra piece.

53
00:02:48,840 --> 00:02:49,960
Inomoto can decide.

54
00:02:49,960 --> 00:02:53,760
I can decide?
I choose Mr. Meat.

55
00:02:52,160 --> 00:02:53,760
I'm gonna smack you.

56
00:02:53,760 --> 00:02:58,600
You've accepted your role as Mr. Meat!

57
00:02:56,570 --> 00:02:58,600
"I'll smack you!" he said.

58
00:02:58,600 --> 00:03:01,300
We need to cooperate at each store right?

59
00:03:01,300 --> 00:03:04,100
Yup.

60
00:03:02,080 --> 00:03:04,100
Five men should be able to finish this.

61
00:03:04,100 --> 00:03:05,700
Enough of that.

62
00:03:05,700 --> 00:03:11,440
You're so naive. You don't respect the yakiniku.
What an amateur!

63
00:03:11,440 --> 00:03:15,400
Well said, Mr. Meat.

64
00:03:15,400 --> 00:03:16,520
Bon appétit!

65
00:03:16,520 --> 00:03:19,440
Itadakimasu.

66
00:03:20,160 --> 00:03:21,440
It's delicious!

67
00:03:21,440 --> 00:03:23,320
Way good!

68
00:03:23,320 --> 00:03:25,670
Who's eating this?

69
00:03:23,660 --> 00:03:25,670
Mr. Meat.

70
00:03:25,670 --> 00:03:28,160
It's all burnt, Mr. Meat.

71
00:03:28,160 --> 00:03:31,360
You're treating him like your senpai.

72
00:03:31,360 --> 00:03:33,780
He's a one year senior to everyone.

73
00:03:35,440 --> 00:03:37,960
Well done!

74
00:03:37,960 --> 00:03:41,140
Finished!

75
00:03:41,340 --> 00:03:43,380
They're close together.

76
00:03:43,380 --> 00:03:46,640
We were at 8-chome just now, next is 6-chome.

77
00:03:46,640 --> 00:03:49,520
A 3 minute drive.

78
00:03:49,520 --> 00:03:54,200
But I'm still fine, I wanna eat more.

79
00:03:52,440 --> 00:03:54,200
It's brought out your hunger.

80
00:03:54,200 --> 00:03:57,940
By the way, you're free to order a side.

81
00:03:57,940 --> 00:04:00,260
But if you order something,

82
00:04:00,260 --> 00:04:01,880
you have to pay for it by yourself.

83
00:04:01,880 --> 00:04:04,160
Our money?

84
00:04:04,160 --> 00:04:06,040
Yes.

85
00:04:06,620 --> 00:04:09,340
They arrive at store #2, Ginza 6-chome.

86
00:04:09,340 --> 00:04:11,900
They choose the specialty short rib.

87
00:04:11,900 --> 00:04:13,820
This way...

88
00:04:13,820 --> 00:04:15,600
Ah, once again,

89
00:04:17,240 --> 00:04:19,600
Ginza 6-chome store!

90
00:04:19,600 --> 00:04:22,600
Let's finish the 2nd store.

91
00:04:22,600 --> 00:04:26,590
Can I order the egg soup?

92
00:04:25,100 --> 00:04:26,590
Egg soup?

93
00:04:26,590 --> 00:04:29,300
You'll get sick just eating meat.

94
00:04:29,300 --> 00:04:31,000
That's true actually

95
00:04:31,270 --> 00:04:33,400
Sorry Matsumoto-san, that'll be 580 yen.

96
00:04:33,400 --> 00:04:34,490
Now?

97
00:04:34,490 --> 00:04:35,980
He has to pay now?

98
00:04:35,980 --> 00:04:37,380
Are you being serious?

99
00:04:37,380 --> 00:04:41,110
It's the rule after all.

100
00:04:41,110 --> 00:04:46,140
This show can't even afford egg soup.

101
00:04:46,140 --> 00:04:47,850
Just cancel it then.

102
00:04:47,850 --> 00:04:51,120
A show that can't afford egg soup...

103
00:04:51,120 --> 00:04:53,060
Just cancel it!

104
00:04:53,060 --> 00:04:54,100
It's here!

105
00:04:54,820 --> 00:04:57,060
Specialty short rib.

106
00:04:57,060 --> 00:04:58,560
There's six of them.

107
00:05:00,400 --> 00:05:04,040
That looks delicious.

108
00:05:04,040 --> 00:05:05,730
Here's your soup.

109
00:05:06,500 --> 00:05:08,780
The egg soup is a necessity.

110
00:05:09,670 --> 00:05:10,910
This is the garnish dish.

111
00:05:10,910 --> 00:05:14,710
Why are you dicks placing it?

112
00:05:14,710 --> 00:05:16,000
This is the sauce right?

113
00:05:17,340 --> 00:05:18,230
How is it?

114
00:05:18,230 --> 00:05:18,900
Delicious!

115
00:05:18,900 --> 00:05:22,820
Can I have 2 pieces?

116
00:05:20,900 --> 00:05:22,000
Oh you're going for it?

117
00:05:24,000 --> 00:05:25,060
Delicious.

118
00:05:25,160 --> 00:05:27,220
Just meat is difficult.

119
00:05:27,560 --> 00:05:29,220
Mmm....this is tasty.

120
00:05:29,220 --> 00:05:33,020
How is the egg soup?

121
00:05:30,660 --> 00:05:33,020
The egg soup was the right choice.

122
00:05:33,020 --> 00:05:34,820
The quantity is a lot, so you can share it-

123
00:05:34,820 --> 00:05:36,500
No no way.

124
00:05:37,620 --> 00:05:42,080
You're not gonna finish that by yourself.

125
00:05:39,400 --> 00:05:42,080
Yeah, just split it.

126
00:05:42,080 --> 00:05:44,440
It's a waste, you're gonna leave it anyways.

127
00:05:44,440 --> 00:05:46,340
That's true.

128
00:05:46,340 --> 00:05:49,110
So slow!

129
00:05:49,300 --> 00:05:51,480
The time is important.

130
00:05:51,480 --> 00:05:56,020
This is how the average Japanese consumes egg soup.

131
00:05:56,020 --> 00:05:58,840
2nd store finished!

132
00:05:59,620 --> 00:06:03,760
That soup was the right idea
Easy to eat. I want some chilled noodles too.

133
00:06:03,760 --> 00:06:06,800
The next store is also in Ginza.

134
00:06:06,800 --> 00:06:08,000
Ginza Core store

135
00:06:08,360 --> 00:06:10,080
There's so many in just Ginza.

136
00:06:10,080 --> 00:06:11,580
Let's go

137
00:06:11,580 --> 00:06:14,170
The 3rd store in Ginza today.

138
00:06:14,170 --> 00:06:16,170
Ginza Core location

139
00:06:17,280 --> 00:06:18,660
This way

140
00:06:28,140 --> 00:06:31,800
Alright

141
00:06:31,800 --> 00:06:34,660
The 3rd store. What is your choice?

142
00:06:34,660 --> 00:06:36,060
Since we're pretty hungry,

143
00:06:36,060 --> 00:06:38,360
Yeah totally

144
00:06:38,360 --> 00:06:41,800
The first stomach, what do you think?

145
00:06:40,360 --> 00:06:41,800
First stomach

146
00:06:41,800 --> 00:06:43,440
OK, first stomach please!

147
00:06:43,440 --> 00:06:44,500
"First stomach, and"

148
00:06:44,500 --> 00:06:46,460
I do wanna say "and, "

149
00:06:48,070 --> 00:06:51,570
Let's look at the side menu.

150
00:06:49,460 --> 00:06:50,500
Side?

151
00:06:50,500 --> 00:06:51,570
Enough already.

152
00:06:51,570 --> 00:06:53,840
You've got a huge appetite.

153
00:06:53,840 --> 00:06:56,980
I want chilled noodles.

154
00:06:56,980 --> 00:07:00,280
Are you sure? There's more stores to visit.

155
00:07:00,280 --> 00:07:06,690
When I'm this hungry I get really stressed out.

156
00:07:06,690 --> 00:07:10,960
I just want to settle my stomach.

157
00:07:12,960 --> 00:07:16,000
Well let's see the stomach first.

158
00:07:16,540 --> 00:07:18,780
We have to drive to the next store too you know.

159
00:07:18,780 --> 00:07:20,640
It's unfortunate eating just this.

160
00:07:20,860 --> 00:07:23,430
You can order half size chilled noodles.

161
00:07:22,700 --> 00:07:24,170
I'll get half then.

162
00:07:24,800 --> 00:07:26,540
Okay then.

163
00:07:26,540 --> 00:07:29,460
Who's gonna eat this meat?

164
00:07:29,460 --> 00:07:31,040
You are of course.

165
00:07:31,040 --> 00:07:32,880
You kept saying you want to.

166
00:07:32,880 --> 00:07:34,440
I mean fine,

167
00:07:36,040 --> 00:07:38,040
Woah that looks good

168
00:07:42,060 --> 00:07:44,380
It's alright, it's alright

169
00:07:43,090 --> 00:07:44,680
You don't want to split this?

170
00:07:44,680 --> 00:07:46,380
This is gonna be good

171
00:07:49,900 --> 00:07:52,600
He's being serious

172
00:07:52,600 --> 00:07:55,640
You're not getting this? Are you guys sure?

173
00:07:55,640 --> 00:07:58,440
I do want to eat it

174
00:07:58,440 --> 00:08:02,220
That looks ready

175
00:08:00,320 --> 00:08:02,220
Server: It's done

176
00:08:02,220 --> 00:08:05,080
Matsumoto-san can have 2 here, right?

177
00:08:05,300 --> 00:08:07,880
I totally can

178
00:08:07,880 --> 00:08:20,330
(tasty!)

179
00:08:20,330 --> 00:08:24,770
I think I'll get noodles at the next store too.

180
00:08:25,520 --> 00:08:28,980
Finished! Next store now.

181
00:08:30,420 --> 00:08:32,760
Easy peasy, let's keep going.

182
00:08:35,520 --> 00:08:37,020
So easy.

183
00:08:37,980 --> 00:08:41,250
I'm getting hungrier and hungrier.

184
00:08:41,250 --> 00:08:43,090
A side is a good idea, I'm telling you.

185
00:08:43,350 --> 00:08:46,920
Maybe I'll get sangchu.

186
00:08:43,350 --> 00:08:46,920
TN: Sangchu is lettuce salad.

187
00:08:46,920 --> 00:08:50,300
No need to pretend like you're holding back.

188
00:08:50,620 --> 00:08:52,940
The next store is also in Ginza.

189
00:08:54,960 --> 00:08:56,260
What's wrong with Ginza?

190
00:08:56,260 --> 00:09:00,080
I mean like, "Wow! Ginza again?"

191
00:09:00,080 --> 00:09:01,240
What do you mean

192
00:09:01,240 --> 00:09:04,880
I was just amazed, Ginza has 4 stores.

193
00:09:03,540 --> 00:09:04,880
It's nice that it's close.

194
00:09:04,880 --> 00:09:06,880
It was a positive "ehhh?!"

195
00:09:07,960 --> 00:09:13,780
A 3 minute drive later and they reach the Ginza VELVIA location.

196
00:09:18,900 --> 00:09:20,600
Let's do this

197
00:09:21,140 --> 00:09:26,600
They choose the Diamond Cut Skirt Steak, as well ...

198
00:09:26,600 --> 00:09:30,820
Can I order a side?

199
00:09:29,480 --> 00:09:30,820
You want to order?

200
00:09:31,500 --> 00:09:34,640
I want to order for myself.

201
00:09:34,640 --> 00:09:36,860
The sangchu?

202
00:09:35,400 --> 00:09:36,860
You don't want to split it?

203
00:09:40,380 --> 00:09:42,620
Diamond Cut Skirt Steak

204
00:09:45,500 --> 00:09:47,500
How many are these? Oh?

205
00:09:47,740 --> 00:09:49,740
We have to cut it.

206
00:09:49,740 --> 00:09:51,740
Oohh, this is amazing!

207
00:09:51,740 --> 00:09:58,040
Woahhh that looks delicious
Smells great

208
00:09:59,020 --> 00:10:00,740
Do you guys want rice?

209
00:10:00,740 --> 00:10:02,740
Can I get some rice actually?

210
00:10:02,740 --> 00:10:05,330
An order of rice?

211
00:10:05,330 --> 00:10:06,320
Looks amazing

212
00:10:06,320 --> 00:10:09,740
This isn't enough for 5 people

213
00:10:09,740 --> 00:10:14,060
If just 2 people want to eat here that's alright.

214
00:10:14,060 --> 00:10:16,360
Well he ordered rice.

215
00:10:16,360 --> 00:10:17,450
Just those 2

216
00:10:17,450 --> 00:10:19,510
Do you want to eat this with me Hosei-san?

217
00:10:19,510 --> 00:10:23,380
Hmmmm I think not.

218
00:10:25,100 --> 00:10:28,690
I want to eat just 1 piece.

219
00:10:28,690 --> 00:10:32,340
1 piece is good for me.

220
00:10:32,500 --> 00:10:35,000
Yeah actually, the rice looks delicious.

221
00:10:35,000 --> 00:10:37,220
Eating it with this meat.

222
00:10:37,220 --> 00:10:40,020
Damn I want rice.

223
00:10:40,020 --> 00:10:43,600
Can we split the rice?

224
00:10:41,300 --> 00:10:43,600
Can we split the rice?

225
00:10:43,460 --> 00:10:44,670
It's up to him.

226
00:10:44,670 --> 00:10:48,310
Let's stop this hoarding of side dishes.

227
00:10:48,310 --> 00:10:51,150
Actually, let's split it.

228
00:10:51,560 --> 00:10:53,960
This time I want us to work together.

229
00:10:53,960 --> 00:10:56,260
I see, that's the important thing.

230
00:10:57,880 --> 00:10:58,880
Delicious!

231
00:10:59,340 --> 00:11:01,600
We can't bring the rice and the sangchu with us.

232
00:11:01,600 --> 00:11:02,700
Of course we can!

233
00:11:02,980 --> 00:11:05,340
Why would you bring sanchu with you?

234
00:11:04,500 --> 00:11:05,660
Yeah

235
00:11:05,660 --> 00:11:07,680
You cut such small pieces of that sangchu

236
00:11:08,080 --> 00:11:09,400
What's with that?

237
00:11:09,400 --> 00:11:11,940
Why not bigger pieces?

238
00:11:14,720 --> 00:11:16,460
Exactly

239
00:11:16,460 --> 00:11:19,030
What are you doing seriously?

240
00:11:18,620 --> 00:11:19,660
You've been exposed.

241
00:11:20,320 --> 00:11:23,180
The meat is finished.

242
00:11:23,600 --> 00:11:25,500
Just that sangchu.

243
00:11:27,500 --> 00:11:28,840
Maybe eat it with miso.

244
00:11:28,840 --> 00:11:31,040
I'll take this with me.

245
00:11:31,040 --> 00:11:33,120
You can try,

246
00:11:33,120 --> 00:11:36,040
ut the store might not let you bring it in.

247
00:11:36,040 --> 00:11:38,240
You're bringing that into the store?

248
00:11:38,360 --> 00:11:39,740
That's no good

249
00:11:39,740 --> 00:11:42,000
You can bring it home if you want

250
00:11:42,230 --> 00:11:45,530
You can eat it in the car.

251
00:11:44,730 --> 00:11:45,530
No way,

252
00:11:45,530 --> 00:11:48,270
Eat it while observing Ginza

253
00:11:48,340 --> 00:11:49,780
Eh? I can't bring it?

254
00:11:49,780 --> 00:11:53,940
Just bring it for now.

255
00:11:53,940 --> 00:11:56,440
This is the side dish problem.

256
00:11:56,440 --> 00:11:58,180
You said I could bring it.

257
00:11:59,080 --> 00:12:01,740
You can't bring it inside.

258
00:12:01,740 --> 00:12:06,160
That's- I can't eat it now.

259
00:12:06,160 --> 00:12:08,160
Bringing it in is...

260
00:12:08,160 --> 00:12:10,900
You can order it in the store again.

261
00:12:10,900 --> 00:12:12,380
It's gonna be a hassle.

262
00:12:12,380 --> 00:12:15,540
Asking "is this OK, is that OK?"

263
00:12:15,540 --> 00:12:17,820
Eh really?

264
00:12:17,820 --> 00:12:20,280
Wait this wasn't my intention!

265
00:12:20,280 --> 00:12:21,840
Just eat it now

266
00:12:21,840 --> 00:12:23,440
Then, what should we do

267
00:12:25,440 --> 00:12:27,820
Each of you give me 100 yen

268
00:12:27,820 --> 00:12:31,320
Why 100 yen from everyone?

269
00:12:31,860 --> 00:12:37,320
At the 5th store, they get the set meal.

270
00:12:37,540 --> 00:12:39,540
There's quite a lot.

271
00:12:39,540 --> 00:12:41,790
Looking at it like this

272
00:12:41,790 --> 00:12:43,880
Bon appetite!

273
00:12:46,440 --> 00:12:47,000
Delicious.

274
00:12:47,000 --> 00:12:49,000
This is way good.

275
00:12:50,000 --> 00:12:55,580
The 5 work together and finish quickly
However...

276
00:12:56,000 --> 00:13:00,780
The meat juice is hitting hard...

277
00:12:59,700 --> 00:13:02,780
Well done! Finished!

278
00:13:05,500 --> 00:13:07,600
I see, this is how it feels.

279
00:13:08,880 --> 00:13:12,250
It comes all of a sudden.

280
00:13:12,250 --> 00:13:15,300
I mean I can still eat,

281
00:13:16,180 --> 00:13:22,760
But I'm starting to feel a little sick.

282
00:13:22,760 --> 00:13:25,970
The rice was a bit much.

283
00:13:25,970 --> 00:13:30,040
The chilled noodles were a bad idea...

284
00:13:30,360 --> 00:13:32,040
Of course!

285
00:13:35,570 --> 00:13:38,000
We're almost there, the Hibiya store.

286
00:13:41,620 --> 00:13:46,980
With little time to spare, they reach Hibiya.

287
00:13:46,980 --> 00:13:48,780
So, the 6th store

288
00:13:49,520 --> 00:13:50,780
What is your order?

289
00:13:51,040 --> 00:13:52,690
Let's get the king crab?

290
00:13:52,690 --> 00:13:55,040
Seafood?

291
00:13:55,040 --> 00:13:59,640
Let's switch to seafood
King crab it is.

292
00:13:59,640 --> 00:14:01,640
I'm gonna take a sh!t.

293
00:14:03,840 --> 00:14:04,840
Hurry up and go.

294
00:14:06,740 --> 00:14:09,560
We'll wait for you to come back.

295
00:14:09,560 --> 00:14:13,960
Of course.

296
00:14:09,980 --> 00:14:13,960
We gotta preserve the teamwork.

297
00:14:13,960 --> 00:14:15,950
I do want to eat Le Crab.

298
00:14:15,950 --> 00:14:18,550
What the hell is "Le Crab"?

299
00:14:20,660 --> 00:14:23,940
Certainly, the greasiness is a lot.

300
00:14:23,940 --> 00:14:26,080
You feel the meat hit after eating.

301
00:14:26,080 --> 00:14:29,660
Hamada, out of 10, how full are you?

302
00:14:29,660 --> 00:14:31,840
Around 6 I think. 5 or 6.

303
00:14:31,840 --> 00:14:33,980
I guess I'm also around 6.

304
00:14:34,200 --> 00:14:36,170
Around 6 for me too.

305
00:14:36,170 --> 00:14:38,720
After,

306
00:14:37,420 --> 00:14:38,720
I'm still,

307
00:14:38,720 --> 00:14:41,010
Tanaka you're fine?

308
00:14:40,070 --> 00:14:41,010
2 to 3 for me.

309
00:14:41,010 --> 00:14:43,220
The meat hits you all of a sudden.

310
00:14:43,220 --> 00:14:45,900
Really? I wouldn't know.

311
00:14:46,710 --> 00:14:50,320
It's cause Tanaka is the tallest.

312
00:14:48,490 --> 00:14:49,510
There it is.

313
00:14:50,320 --> 00:14:52,540
He says that every time.

314
00:14:51,860 --> 00:14:53,220
That's not it.

315
00:14:53,220 --> 00:14:54,140
Ah, he's back.

316
00:14:54,140 --> 00:14:56,600
He looks so dissapointed.

317
00:14:56,600 --> 00:14:57,400
It's not here yet?

318
00:14:57,580 --> 00:14:58,600
Nope.

319
00:14:58,600 --> 00:15:02,820
You could've finished while I was gone.

320
00:15:02,820 --> 00:15:06,860
It's not here yet though.

321
00:15:05,090 --> 00:15:07,540
It's here, right on time.

322
00:15:06,860 --> 00:15:10,720
Wait you didn't wait for me right?

323
00:15:12,540 --> 00:15:14,580
Right on time.

324
00:15:14,580 --> 00:15:18,600
Tanaka says he's not full at all, by this point.

325
00:15:18,600 --> 00:15:20,860
It seems he's really starving.

326
00:15:20,000 --> 00:15:24,000
No no, we were all talk-

327
00:15:20,860 --> 00:15:24,000
He said he's at a 2/10

328
00:15:24,000 --> 00:15:27,450
We all said we're around 6.

329
00:15:27,450 --> 00:15:34,160
Woah, you guys are already at 6?!

330
00:15:37,020 --> 00:15:39,920
Hear me out, you guys haven't eaten that much.

331
00:15:39,920 --> 00:15:43,040
And you're still at 6?

332
00:15:43,040 --> 00:15:45,910
I mean I'm at 8, but...

333
00:15:45,910 --> 00:15:50,310
Cause I ate the noodles!

334
00:15:47,380 --> 00:15:50,310
That's your fault.

335
00:15:55,000 --> 00:15:57,000
Let's eat!

336
00:16:02,260 --> 00:16:04,260
This change of taste is nice.

337
00:16:04,880 --> 00:16:11,720
Man this is a culture shock for me
I didn't know the Gaki members could eat so little.

338
00:16:11,720 --> 00:16:14,340
I've definitely eaten the most.

339
00:16:14,340 --> 00:16:16,340
Finshed!

340
00:16:16,860 --> 00:16:18,660
Let's go!

341
00:16:22,700 --> 00:16:25,520
I want a bit of a challenge here.

342
00:16:25,520 --> 00:16:27,450
I've calculated this choice.

343
00:16:27,450 --> 00:16:30,360
I didn't think the stores would be this close by.

344
00:16:31,280 --> 00:16:36,260
Diamond Cut Short Rib
They arrive at 7th store while complaining about the distance.

345
00:16:37,620 --> 00:16:38,620
We're here.

346
00:16:40,040 --> 00:16:42,840
Okay, let's get past here.

347
00:16:44,630 --> 00:16:48,020
I think I've caught a cold.

348
00:16:48,020 --> 00:16:51,070
Do you have a thermometer?

349
00:16:51,070 --> 00:16:53,340
I might have a fever.

350
00:16:52,160 --> 00:16:54,040
You don't!

351
00:16:54,040 --> 00:16:58,200
Is there a thermometer?

352
00:16:58,200 --> 00:17:02,840
There's a chance that my appetite will be affected.

353
00:17:01,630 --> 00:17:03,970
Cause you have a cold?

354
00:17:03,340 --> 00:17:05,220
It's here!

355
00:17:07,140 --> 00:17:09,380
There's just one.

356
00:17:09,380 --> 00:17:13,300
Just one piece, please use these scissors.

357
00:17:19,380 --> 00:17:23,600
Here, the still hungry Tanaka makes a statement.

358
00:17:24,540 --> 00:17:27,560
I will definitely eat half of this.

359
00:17:27,560 --> 00:17:29,980
I'll get this piece.

360
00:17:32,700 --> 00:17:34,900
Impressive.

361
00:17:40,760 --> 00:17:47,040
Tanaka takes responsibility for half, while the other four munch away.

362
00:17:49,320 --> 00:17:50,680
Here I go.

363
00:17:50,680 --> 00:17:53,740
We will remember your initiative here Tanaka.

364
00:17:53,770 --> 00:17:56,940
Remember it please then.

365
00:17:58,460 --> 00:18:00,840
Finished! Let's go to the next store.

366
00:18:00,840 --> 00:18:05,440
Liscense, you guys gotta pay attention
Yamasaki isn't eating at all!

367
00:18:05,440 --> 00:18:06,120
That's true.

368
00:18:06,120 --> 00:18:11,880
I mean if you eat from the side menu,

369
00:18:11,880 --> 00:18:17,760
I'm eating the same as everyone,
and I've got a 40 degree fever.

370
00:18:13,860 --> 00:18:17,760
TN: 40 degrees Celsius is 313.15 Kelvin

371
00:18:16,200 --> 00:18:17,760
40 degrees?

372
00:18:17,760 --> 00:18:22,000
I said maybe, I don't know.
It might be higher.

373
00:18:23,120 --> 00:18:27,970
Pork Jowl Wasabi
Meanwhile, they arrive at the 8th store, inside the Marunouchi Building.

374
00:18:29,060 --> 00:18:33,420
Here, they take Matsumoto's temperature.

375
00:18:34,260 --> 00:18:41,160
My throat definitley hurts.
I can feel a cold coming on.

376
00:18:41,350 --> 00:18:44,050
If you switched bodies with me.

377
00:18:44,050 --> 00:18:48,140
You'll say;
"Woah, seriously?! This guy is really pushing himself!"

378
00:18:48,140 --> 00:18:52,120
"How can he be this eager?"

379
00:18:52,120 --> 00:18:54,420
You guys would collapse and this would end.

380
00:18:54,820 --> 00:18:58,880
I'm not sure about that.

381
00:19:03,340 --> 00:19:04,900
What are you doing?!

382
00:19:05,260 --> 00:19:07,800
It'll be 80 degrees then.

383
00:19:09,440 --> 00:19:12,640
Seriously I do have one, I actually do.

384
00:19:12,640 --> 00:19:15,440
How high?

385
00:19:13,700 --> 00:19:15,440
It's a real fever.

386
00:19:18,040 --> 00:19:20,370
In that case we'll understand.

387
00:19:21,120 --> 00:19:22,980
Pork Jowl Wasabi

388
00:19:24,520 --> 00:19:27,760
There's wasabi coated on the meat.

389
00:19:31,140 --> 00:19:33,520
Take it from him.

390
00:19:36,080 --> 00:19:37,240
How high is it?

391
00:19:39,240 --> 00:19:40,920
That's a normal temperature.

392
00:19:40,920 --> 00:19:42,560
36.7 is like the best isn't it?

393
00:19:42,900 --> 00:19:44,760
The best temperature, yes.

394
00:19:43,660 --> 00:19:45,320
What do you mean, best temperature?

395
00:19:45,320 --> 00:19:49,320
If it was serious, it would be over 37.

396
00:19:49,320 --> 00:19:51,320
Who will have that piece?

397
00:19:51,320 --> 00:19:54,000
I'll have it then, I'm still fine.

398
00:19:54,280 --> 00:19:56,390
Alright, Endo you go.

399
00:20:03,620 --> 00:20:04,760
I'm going for two pieces.

400
00:20:05,540 --> 00:20:07,000
It's good?

401
00:20:13,520 --> 00:20:15,240
It would be good with alcohol.

402
00:20:15,380 --> 00:20:17,240
Finished!

403
00:20:17,500 --> 00:20:18,240
Next store.

404
00:20:18,780 --> 00:20:20,020
Let's go.

405
00:20:21,380 --> 00:20:23,320
I feel sicker than expected.

406
00:20:23,320 --> 00:20:25,750
It hits afterwards.

407
00:20:26,900 --> 00:20:30,100
The 9th store is pretty close.

408
00:20:31,600 --> 00:20:33,280
It's close by.

409
00:20:34,280 --> 00:20:39,220
Filet
With no time to rest, they arrive at the 9th store in Yaesu.

410
00:20:40,640 --> 00:20:41,640
Six again.

411
00:20:41,640 --> 00:20:44,120
There's six piece again.

412
00:20:44,120 --> 00:20:46,120
I'll get this one then.

413
00:20:46,400 --> 00:20:47,600
Really?

414
00:20:46,820 --> 00:20:47,600
Yes.

415
00:20:48,480 --> 00:20:52,360
They cooperate, feeling the burden of the fattyness.

416
00:20:52,580 --> 00:20:54,000
They aim to finish.

417
00:20:54,600 --> 00:20:55,650
Oh this is delicious.

418
00:20:55,650 --> 00:20:57,650
It's good, right?

419
00:20:59,650 --> 00:21:01,590
Finished!

420
00:21:02,060 --> 00:21:03,440
Let's head to the next store.

421
00:21:04,080 --> 00:21:07,460
We will reach the Akihabara store soon.

422
00:21:09,010 --> 00:21:11,130
Have you decided your order?

423
00:21:11,240 --> 00:21:14,500
I've never seen Gopchang before.

424
00:21:15,720 --> 00:21:18,310
Ahh let's go for something we haven't seen.

425
00:21:17,230 --> 00:21:19,100
It's a cute name too, Gopchang.

426
00:21:19,100 --> 00:21:20,700
Let's conquer the gopchang.

427
00:21:20,700 --> 00:21:22,180
It's made of intestine.

428
00:21:23,100 --> 00:21:28,200
They decide on gopchang, a perfect balance of umami, sweetness, and fat.

429
00:21:31,400 --> 00:21:32,450
Hmm.

430
00:21:37,100 --> 00:21:41,170
Who will eat the extra pieces?

431
00:21:41,170 --> 00:21:46,000
I will take care of them.

432
00:21:46,000 --> 00:21:49,870
Can I see the side menu?

433
00:21:52,380 --> 00:21:54,950
Side menu at this point...

434
00:21:57,970 --> 00:21:59,970
I see.

435
00:22:01,970 --> 00:22:06,550
I think I'll get a salad.

436
00:22:03,240 --> 00:22:06,550
I see, add some vegetables.

437
00:22:06,840 --> 00:22:10,340
There's a lot of fat on these.

438
00:22:10,760 --> 00:22:12,340
They look ready.

439
00:22:12,340 --> 00:22:14,340
Sorry for the wait.

440
00:22:14,760 --> 00:22:16,340
Whoa, here it is.

441
00:22:20,740 --> 00:22:25,040
No that's alright, he's eating that by himself.

442
00:22:25,040 --> 00:22:28,600
Man, I wanted to split it this time too.

443
00:22:36,380 --> 00:22:38,980
It does look delicious after all.

444
00:22:47,420 --> 00:22:48,420
Tasty.

445
00:22:48,420 --> 00:22:50,300
It's sweet.

446
00:22:50,300 --> 00:22:51,300
Yum!

447
00:22:53,060 --> 00:22:54,600
Finshed! Let's go.

448
00:22:58,480 --> 00:23:00,000
How do you feel now?

449
00:23:00,000 --> 00:23:04,910
Honestly, I feel just right.

450
00:23:04,910 --> 00:23:06,080
Are you at a 5?

451
00:23:06,620 --> 00:23:09,650
Nah, like full.

452
00:23:07,840 --> 00:23:09,650
So a 10?

453
00:23:09,650 --> 00:23:17,940
My stomach is nice and ... plump, like this.

454
00:23:20,200 --> 00:23:24,000
I didn't think I would feel this full after two...

455
00:23:24,000 --> 00:23:26,620
There's no escape.

456
00:23:27,340 --> 00:23:31,460
Next week; Yakiniku Toraji Part 2.

457
00:23:32,240 --> 00:23:35,790
A new rule changes their fates!

458
00:23:35,940 --> 00:23:38,400
Ready, steady, flip!

459
00:23:41,440 --> 00:23:43,560
Save me please.

460
00:23:43,560 --> 00:23:44,560
NO MORE!

461
00:23:44,960 --> 00:23:49,260
Will they be able to finish?!
