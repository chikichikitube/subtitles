00:00:02,450 --> 00:00:07,290
The First Gaki-no-Tsukai Arahende Thorough Search Project!
Let's stroll around town until we find a celebrity!!

4
00:00:07,690 --> 00:00:09,830
Sangenjaya Edition!

5
00:00:10,490 --> 00:00:11,090
Let's go!

6
00:00:11,860 --> 00:00:13,460
What number is this?

7
00:00:13,530 --> 00:00:15,230
It's our third... no, our fourth time!

8
00:00:15,230 --> 00:00:16,070
Hold on.

9
00:00:16,200 --> 00:00:19,000
We're in the correct shoot, right?
It's not something else, right?

10
00:00:19,000 --> 00:00:20,500
We did prank you last time, didn't we?

11
00:00:20,670 --> 00:00:23,010
Oh right, we didn't do any of the stuff we wanted to do last time.

12
00:00:23,010 --> 00:00:24,540
It was my bad, I'm actually sorry.

13
00:00:24,740 --> 00:00:26,810
But I don't trust you guys anymore.

14
00:00:27,240 --> 00:00:29,280
You don't trust the staff.

15
00:00:29,310 --> 00:00:32,280
But we thought you wouldn't come back, you know?

16
00:00:32,680 --> 00:00:33,680
He doesn't trust us.

17
00:00:34,320 --> 00:00:35,790
You've stopped trusting us!

18
00:00:35,820 --> 00:00:36,920
What a shame, Hamada!

19
00:00:36,920 --> 00:00:37,720
I'm not leaving!
What a shame, Hamada!

20
00:00:37,720 --> 00:00:37,820
I'm not leaving!

21
00:00:37,820 --> 00:00:38,260
He says that, but didn't he go home super early back at Jiyugaoka?
I'm not leaving!

22
00:00:38,260 --> 00:00:40,890
He says that, but didn't he go home super early back at Jiyugaoka?

23
00:00:40,890 --> 00:00:41,630
Right.

24
00:00:41,790 --> 00:00:42,790
You were too free! (Jiyu = free, Oka = Hill, Jiyugaoka = Hill of the free)

25
00:00:45,360 --> 00:00:50,370
This very same program was filmed back in March at Jiyugaoka, the high-end residential area.

26
00:00:50,770 --> 00:00:52,600
I'd never do this in February.

27
00:00:53,140 --> 00:00:55,340
This great search took 5 hours!

28
00:00:56,910 --> 00:00:59,380
And in the end, the guys didn't find a single celebrity.

29
00:01:01,450 --> 00:01:04,580
And finally, Hamada sneaked out!

30
00:01:06,550 --> 00:01:10,750
This left a deep wound on the member's hearts.

31
00:01:13,460 --> 00:01:16,690
Now, in this new town, the guys are looking for revenge!

32
00:01:18,560 --> 00:01:21,230
It's Setagaya ward's, Sangenjaya!

33
00:01:22,830 --> 00:01:26,870
Rows of shops line the side of the streets.

34
00:01:27,270 --> 00:01:30,670
It's Setagaya's most popular entertainment district, where people gather in droves!

35
00:01:32,580 --> 00:01:37,380
Many celebrities are said to live in this area, and the boys cannot leave until they find one!

36
00:01:37,680 --> 00:01:39,680
A ruthless challenge awaits them!

37
00:01:40,280 --> 00:01:43,250
I'm just gonna come out and say it, that shirt is too much man.

38
00:01:44,520 --> 00:01:46,420
What do you mean?

39
00:01:46,790 --> 00:01:48,630
Hold on, hold on...

40
00:01:48,660 --> 00:01:50,490
I wasn't trying to be funny or anything lik that!

41
00:01:50,630 --> 00:01:53,630
An oblivious airhead is funny, but gets old once he's aware of it.

42
00:01:54,330 --> 00:01:57,000
Hold on, hold on, I'm not trying to do anything!

43
00:01:57,000 --> 00:01:57,570
I'm not pulling anything here!

44
00:01:57,570 --> 00:01:58,000
I'm serious!
I'm not pulling anything here!

45
00:01:58,000 --> 00:01:58,870
I'm serious!

46
00:01:58,940 --> 00:01:59,740
What is it then?

47
00:02:00,670 --> 00:02:02,240
There's someone with a mask over there, who is it?

48
00:02:02,370 --> 00:02:02,870
You're right!

49
00:02:03,170 --> 00:02:03,740
Is she a celebrity?

50
00:02:04,640 --> 00:02:05,540
She's wearing a mask.

51
00:02:06,080 --> 00:02:07,540
There's someone over there.

52
00:02:08,610 --> 00:02:09,310
Who? Who? Who?

53
00:02:10,510 --> 00:02:11,350
Ah, excuse me.

54
00:02:13,350 --> 00:02:17,390
Let's stroll around until we find a celebrity!
Sangenjaya Edition!

55
00:02:18,220 --> 00:02:22,490
These are the rules: The shoot won't end until we meet a celebrity.

56
00:02:23,460 --> 00:02:28,370
However, all members have to know the celebrity's name.

57
00:02:28,930 --> 00:02:32,200
And naturally, we also need filming consent from their respective agencies.

58
00:02:33,800 --> 00:02:35,510
The time is 4:06 PM.

59
00:02:36,170 --> 00:02:39,140
The search begins under the sunny sky!

60
00:02:39,880 --> 00:02:43,950
The setting sun!! The setting sun is hitting me!

61
00:02:43,950 --> 00:02:45,880
We actually found some celebrities in Jiyugaoka.

62
00:02:46,480 --> 00:02:47,780
I asked them later, you know?

63
00:02:47,820 --> 00:02:48,790
NONSTYLE's Ishida was there.

64
00:02:48,790 --> 00:02:49,120
That's great.
NONSTYLE's Ishida was there.

65
00:02:49,120 --> 00:02:49,590
That's great.

66
00:02:49,590 --> 00:02:49,920
Oh, really?
That's great.

67
00:02:49,920 --> 00:02:50,120
Oh, really?

68
00:02:50,120 --> 00:02:50,420
And Akihito from Porno Graffiti.
Oh, really?

69
00:02:50,420 --> 00:02:50,450
And Akihito from Porno Graffiti.

70
00:02:50,450 --> 00:02:51,220
Right, right.
And Akihito from Porno Graffiti.

71
00:02:51,220 --> 00:02:52,260
And Akihito from Porno Graffiti.

72
00:02:53,760 --> 00:02:57,830
NONSTYLE's Ishida was getting some work on his teeth at that dentist on the second floor, wasn't he?

73
00:02:57,990 --> 00:02:58,730
Oh, is that so?

74
00:02:58,730 --> 00:02:59,000
He was watching the shoot from the second floor, but that brat didn't wanna come down.
Oh, is that so?

75
00:02:59,000 --> 00:03:02,030
He was watching the shoot from the second floor, but that brat didn't wanna come down.

76
00:03:02,030 --> 00:03:02,930
I see!

77
00:03:03,170 --> 00:03:04,170
That was the worst.

78
00:03:04,200 --> 00:03:06,140
He really didn't want to come down...

79
00:03:07,170 --> 00:03:11,540
The guys get right to work as they set a path towards Carrot Tower.

80
00:03:13,140 --> 00:03:15,010
And then Matsumoto does this...

81
00:03:15,980 --> 00:03:19,420
You never know, there might be a poetry class there.
We might find someone.

82
00:03:20,380 --> 00:03:21,350
A poetry class?

83
00:03:21,380 --> 00:03:22,850
Nothing but old people attend those classes!

84
00:03:22,950 --> 00:03:23,550
Look, look.

85
00:03:23,620 --> 00:03:24,790
Look at the poetry class.

86
00:03:24,790 --> 00:03:25,660
We can't go in there.

87
00:03:26,260 --> 00:03:27,090
It's fine, don't worry.

88
00:03:27,090 --> 00:03:27,990
Try going in.

89
00:03:28,120 --> 00:03:28,660
Look at this!

90
00:03:28,660 --> 00:03:28,930
It's fine, try...
Look at this!

91
00:03:28,930 --> 00:03:29,930
It's fine, try...

92
00:03:30,130 --> 00:03:32,530
You never know, they could be doing some rad poetry in there.

93
00:03:32,600 --> 00:03:34,000
You can't go in there, it's totally blocked.

94
00:03:34,260 --> 00:03:34,730
For real?

95
00:03:34,800 --> 00:03:35,370
We can't?

96
00:03:35,400 --> 00:03:35,870
Yeah...

97
00:03:36,100 --> 00:03:37,100
Not even the owners can get in there.

98
00:03:37,100 --> 00:03:37,930
Right?

99
00:03:38,070 --> 00:03:39,240
See? It's locked.

100
00:03:41,570 --> 00:03:43,070
Don't go opening up other people's homes.

101
00:03:43,140 --> 00:03:44,910
It says, "We teach a variety of poems".

102
00:03:45,610 --> 00:03:48,310
I barely touched the knob and look at how dirty my hands are.

103
00:03:49,550 --> 00:03:50,380
That's why we told you!

104
00:03:51,880 --> 00:03:54,180
Oh, we're at the cinema now.

105
00:03:54,520 --> 00:03:56,150
There was a movie theater here, look!

106
00:03:56,220 --> 00:03:56,920
-A retro one.
-Oh right, it was here.

107
00:03:56,920 --> 00:03:57,420
-Which one was it?
-This one, this one.
-A retro one.
-Oh right, it was here.

108
00:03:57,420 --> 00:03:57,520
-Which one was it?
-This one, this one.

109
00:03:57,520 --> 00:03:57,720
This one, here.
-Which one was it?
-This one, this one.

110
00:03:57,720 --> 00:03:58,390
This one, here.

111
00:03:59,320 --> 00:04:00,120
This is the one.

112
00:04:00,320 --> 00:04:02,390
And there was another one over there.

113
00:04:02,390 --> 00:04:02,660
Oh really?

114
00:04:02,660 --> 00:04:02,830
I wonder what they'll do with this one...
Oh really?

115
00:04:02,830 --> 00:04:04,760
I wonder what they'll do with this one...

116
00:04:05,460 --> 00:04:07,860
I think they're demolishing this remaining one.

117
00:04:08,100 --> 00:04:10,830
The atmosphere around here was really good.

118
00:04:11,940 --> 00:04:14,740
Even so, I think we'll be done fairly quickly today.

119
00:04:14,840 --> 00:04:15,340
You think?

120
00:04:15,470 --> 00:04:16,470
Yes, definitely.

121
00:04:16,870 --> 00:04:19,740
We're gonna have too much free time, we won't know what to do with it.

122
00:04:20,480 --> 00:04:20,940
You have a feeling?

123
00:04:20,940 --> 00:04:21,680
Yeah.

124
00:04:22,280 --> 00:04:23,610
Endo, keep an eye out cause a lot of them just run away.

125
00:04:23,610 --> 00:04:24,450
I'm looking!
Endo, keep an eye out cause a lot of them just run away.

126
00:04:24,450 --> 00:04:25,420
Endo, keep an eye out cause a lot of them just run away.

127
00:04:25,420 --> 00:04:26,020
Sure, sure.
Endo, keep an eye out cause a lot of them just run away.

128
00:04:26,020 --> 00:04:26,120
Endo, keep an eye out cause a lot of them just run away.

129
00:04:26,150 --> 00:04:26,950
We can't let them get away this time.
I'm keeping my eyes peeled.

130
00:04:26,950 --> 00:04:27,750
We can't let them get away this time.

131
00:04:28,650 --> 00:04:31,790
I feel like there's tons of actors and musicians around here.

132
00:04:31,820 --> 00:04:32,620
I don't know about that...

133
00:04:32,660 --> 00:04:35,130
Look out for the ones wearing hats.

134
00:04:35,160 --> 00:04:36,330
Hats and masks.

135
00:04:36,330 --> 00:04:36,330
Masks, right.
Hats and masks.

136
00:04:36,330 --> 00:04:37,190
Masks, right.

137
00:04:37,890 --> 00:04:41,300
Where do people go in this area?

138
00:04:41,300 --> 00:04:41,500
In Sangenjaya?
Where do people go in this area?

139
00:04:41,500 --> 00:04:42,030
In Sangenjaya?

140
00:04:42,030 --> 00:04:42,330
We're right in the center.
In Sangenjaya?

141
00:04:42,330 --> 00:04:43,170
We're right in the center.

142
00:04:43,170 --> 00:04:43,530
Here?

143
00:04:43,530 --> 00:04:44,230
Let's walk around here.
Here?

144
00:04:44,230 --> 00:04:44,600
Let's walk around here.

145
00:04:45,140 --> 00:04:47,100
Who's most familiar with this place?

146
00:04:47,370 --> 00:04:48,870
I think that's me.

147
00:04:49,340 --> 00:04:50,170
Hosei, you?

148
00:04:51,340 --> 00:04:54,510
Where are we going?
Do we have a destination, like Tsutaya?
(Video rental store and bookstore chain)

149
00:04:54,710 --> 00:04:55,650
We can aim for Tsutaya.

150
00:04:55,710 --> 00:04:56,580
-Let's go to Tsutaya.
-Can we even go in there?

151
00:04:57,450 --> 00:04:58,580
We can't film inside Carrot Tower.

152
00:04:58,580 --> 00:04:58,720
We can't go in, he says.
We can't film inside Carrot Tower.

153
00:04:58,720 --> 00:04:59,420
We can't go in, he says.

154
00:04:59,520 --> 00:05:01,620
We'll have to wait outside Carrot Tower then.

155
00:05:01,620 --> 00:05:02,050
That's right.

156
00:05:03,290 --> 00:05:08,020
The guys go around Carrot Tower and arrive at the stoplight opposite Seiyu.
(Seiyu is a Group of supermarkets, shopping centers and department stores)

157
00:05:09,730 --> 00:05:13,200
There's a Seiyu and a Tokyu store, lots of people buy their groceries here.

158
00:05:13,430 --> 00:05:15,770
Celebrities have to be buying their groceries here.

159
00:05:15,870 --> 00:05:16,800
You're totally right.

160
00:05:16,830 --> 00:05:17,900
There's tons of stores on this street.

161
00:05:17,900 --> 00:05:18,940
Our researchers have told us this is the most likely place to find a celebrity.
There's tons of stores on this street.

162
00:05:18,940 --> 00:05:21,540
Our researchers have told us this is the most likely place to find a celebrity.

163
00:05:21,870 --> 00:05:22,570
For example:

164
00:05:22,910 --> 00:05:23,670
Yumi Adachi.

165
00:05:23,770 --> 00:05:24,570
Yumi Adachi?

166
00:05:25,110 --> 00:05:26,440
Or Dragon Ash's vocalist.

167
00:05:26,440 --> 00:05:26,680
Dragon Ash's vocalist?
Or Dragon Ash's vocalist.

168
00:05:26,680 --> 00:05:27,880
Dragon Ash's vocalist?

169
00:05:28,010 --> 00:05:29,310
Dragon Ash's vocalist?

170
00:05:29,810 --> 00:05:30,680
Furuya, right?

171
00:05:30,850 --> 00:05:31,580
Furuya?

172
00:05:31,580 --> 00:05:32,080
Yes.

173
00:05:33,820 --> 00:05:38,690
With the staff's tips, the crew keeps searching.

174
00:05:42,190 --> 00:05:42,890
There ain't nobody!

175
00:05:44,690 --> 00:05:45,130
Wait, wait...

176
00:05:45,830 --> 00:05:47,300
We've just arrived, you know?

177
00:05:48,530 --> 00:05:51,740
That's right, they have barely just begun!

178
00:05:52,600 --> 00:05:55,070
This sun drains your stamina right away, don't you think?

179
00:05:55,370 --> 00:05:56,540
Yeah, it does.

180
00:05:56,570 --> 00:05:57,710
Yeah.

181
00:05:58,270 --> 00:06:00,910
This is the perfect place, Muji.
(Muji is a retailer that sells household and consumer goods.)

182
00:06:01,210 --> 00:06:01,980
Right, Muji!

183
00:06:01,980 --> 00:06:02,450
But we can't go in.

184
00:06:03,080 --> 00:06:04,650
But one of us can go in and check, right?

185
00:06:04,650 --> 00:06:05,480
Oh, right.

186
00:06:07,120 --> 00:06:07,550
Should I go?

187
00:06:07,680 --> 00:06:08,080
-Sure.
-Okay.

188
00:06:08,920 --> 00:06:09,620
I'll tag along.

189
00:06:09,890 --> 00:06:10,920
Let's go then.

190
00:06:10,950 --> 00:06:11,520
Go ahead.

191
00:06:12,020 --> 00:06:14,220
Wait, what if someone walks by and all of you are inside?!

192
00:06:14,320 --> 00:06:15,160
Then, should I stay?

193
00:06:15,930 --> 00:06:17,560
Yamasaki, you stay too.

194
00:06:18,560 --> 00:06:19,500
We'll go ahead then.

195
00:06:19,800 --> 00:06:20,800
Cocorico, you guys stay too.

196
00:06:21,000 --> 00:06:22,100
Oh, then we'll stay behind.

197
00:06:22,500 --> 00:06:23,630
Alright, then.

198
00:06:24,300 --> 00:06:25,470
W-W-What?!

199
00:06:25,600 --> 00:06:26,400
What are you doing?

200
00:06:26,570 --> 00:06:27,240
Everyone's staying.

201
00:06:27,370 --> 00:06:28,410
No, no, no!

202
00:06:28,440 --> 00:06:29,940
Hamada, you should go in.

203
00:06:29,940 --> 00:06:30,140
You idiot!
Hamada, you should go in.

204
00:06:30,140 --> 00:06:30,940
You idiot!

205
00:06:31,510 --> 00:06:32,240
I don't know what's happening anymore.

206
00:06:32,310 --> 00:06:33,540
I don't know what to do anymore.

207
00:06:33,580 --> 00:06:34,210
I told you guys to go!

208
00:06:34,210 --> 00:06:34,510
I don't know either.
I told you guys to go!

209
00:06:34,510 --> 00:06:35,210
I don't know either.

210
00:06:35,250 --> 00:06:36,250
I don't know what to do anymore.

211
00:06:36,710 --> 00:06:39,380
Matsumoto and Yamasaki, just go.

212
00:06:39,920 --> 00:06:40,180
Okay.

213
00:06:40,220 --> 00:06:41,250
We'll go as well, okay?

214
00:06:41,250 --> 00:06:41,790
No, you guys don't all have to go!
We'll go as well, okay?

215
00:06:41,790 --> 00:06:43,450
No, you guys don't all have to go!

216
00:06:44,120 --> 00:06:45,220
We have to keep searching!

217
00:06:46,520 --> 00:06:47,590
Then, are you going in alone, Yamasaki?

218
00:06:47,690 --> 00:06:48,120
Sure.

219
00:06:48,260 --> 00:06:49,660
Sure, he can go in alone, I don't care.

220
00:06:49,890 --> 00:06:50,630
Then, I'll go in as well.

221
00:06:50,930 --> 00:06:51,960
Me too.

222
00:06:52,860 --> 00:06:53,660
Let's all go in together.

223
00:06:53,700 --> 00:06:54,830
What the hell are you on about?

224
00:06:54,900 --> 00:06:56,830
What if someone walks by?!

225
00:06:56,830 --> 00:06:58,070
I got confused, sorry.

226
00:06:58,100 --> 00:06:59,870
What the hell are you guys thinking?

227
00:07:00,370 --> 00:07:01,570
I got confused.

228
00:07:02,640 --> 00:07:06,510
In the end, Matsumoto and Hosei search the store.

229
00:07:07,680 --> 00:07:11,380
Hamada and Kokoriko search the streets for celebrities.

230
00:07:11,850 --> 00:07:13,350
You never know, they always run away.

231
00:07:13,380 --> 00:07:14,580
-Yeah.
-Yes, it always happens.

232
00:07:15,350 --> 00:07:19,220
Personally, I think they'll sneak around more easily once the sun goes down, so we have to be quick.

233
00:07:19,290 --> 00:07:20,320
You're totally right.

234
00:07:21,020 --> 00:07:23,090
I don't wanna experience Jiyugaoka again...

235
00:07:25,230 --> 00:07:26,530
5 minutes after they started searching...

236
00:07:27,430 --> 00:07:28,030
Let's go, let's go.

237
00:07:28,770 --> 00:07:29,270
You didn't find anyone, right?

238
00:07:31,300 --> 00:07:33,240
They did not find a single celebrity.

239
00:07:35,610 --> 00:07:37,340
Damn it!

240
00:07:37,440 --> 00:07:38,780
Celebrities~!

241
00:07:41,340 --> 00:07:47,450
Next up, the guys head to Chazawa street, the main road lined up with tons of stores!

242
00:07:48,990 --> 00:07:49,750
So freaking hot!

243
00:07:50,720 --> 00:07:52,120
Let's find one soon!

244
00:07:52,260 --> 00:07:52,990
It's so hot.

245
00:07:53,620 --> 00:07:55,960
But there are plenty of stores all around here.

246
00:07:57,030 --> 00:08:00,030
Ah... I hate this sun...

247
00:08:01,130 --> 00:08:02,130
It's so hot.

248
00:08:03,070 --> 00:08:06,470
Maybe they start coming out to the bars at night...

249
00:08:07,070 --> 00:08:11,310
-No, I don't think we'll go that late...
-Right, we wanna finish earlier than that.

250
00:08:13,340 --> 00:08:14,440
They could be in there.

251
00:08:16,650 --> 00:08:17,980
This place is pretty popular.

252
00:08:18,520 --> 00:08:21,450
Cocorico goes inside this popular Pachinko parlor!

253
00:08:23,420 --> 00:08:27,520
Meanwhile, the remaining members are left outside to keep the search going.

254
00:08:28,420 --> 00:08:30,360
Yama, make sure to take a good look inside the cars as well.
They're definitely there.

255
00:08:30,360 --> 00:08:30,730
Sure.
Yama, make sure to take a good look inside the cars as well.
They're definitely there.

256
00:08:30,730 --> 00:08:31,530
Yama, make sure to take a good look inside the cars as well.
They're definitely there.

257
00:08:32,360 --> 00:08:34,530
We can't let them slip between our fingers.

258
00:08:34,730 --> 00:08:36,030
They always run away.

259
00:08:37,800 --> 00:08:38,470
And then...

260
00:08:40,440 --> 00:08:41,670
They said there's no one famous today.

261
00:08:42,440 --> 00:08:45,210
But sometimes they see Seiji Rokkaku.

262
00:08:46,710 --> 00:08:48,210
That's so like him!

263
00:08:48,510 --> 00:08:49,450
Mr. Rokkaku.

264
00:08:49,480 --> 00:08:50,780
That's so funny!

265
00:08:51,010 --> 00:08:52,680
Mr. Rokkaku would definitely be in there.

266
00:08:52,680 --> 00:08:55,290
I really wanted to find him there!

267
00:08:55,650 --> 00:08:57,750
I kinda feel like meeting him now.

268
00:08:59,460 --> 00:09:00,920
Let's try going after him.

269
00:09:01,990 --> 00:09:03,330
Going after him?

270
00:09:07,500 --> 00:09:10,100
There ain't nobody around...

271
00:09:11,700 --> 00:09:14,640
I mean, we're just looking for a single celebrity...

272
00:09:17,240 --> 00:09:18,980
It's been 46 minutes since the search started.

273
00:09:19,840 --> 00:09:23,780
With the sun shining down their faces, the guys have started to show some signs of fatigue.

274
00:09:24,850 --> 00:09:27,480
My stamina gauge is starting to deplete, you know?

275
00:09:28,020 --> 00:09:29,050
-You're already tired?
-Yeah.

276
00:09:29,990 --> 00:09:30,350
That was fast!

277
00:09:33,220 --> 00:09:34,320
The sun burned right through me.

278
00:09:34,520 --> 00:09:35,590
The sun, huh?

279
00:09:42,870 --> 00:09:43,570
You're kidding me.

280
00:09:44,730 --> 00:09:45,570
Huh? This bump?

281
00:09:45,800 --> 00:09:46,300
This one.

282
00:09:47,370 --> 00:09:48,000
On this?

283
00:09:48,000 --> 00:09:48,710
Yes, that's the one.

284
00:09:48,970 --> 00:09:50,240
It's all the sun's fault, you know?

285
00:09:50,610 --> 00:09:52,140
The sun is really draining my stamina...

286
00:09:52,840 --> 00:09:55,110
I can't believe you tripped over this thing...

287
00:09:55,310 --> 00:09:55,750
On this...

288
00:09:56,980 --> 00:09:59,380
See how much they're digging into him for such a small thing?

289
00:09:59,420 --> 00:10:04,420
I have to be super careful when I walk, you never know what they're gonna say.

290
00:10:05,560 --> 00:10:07,290
This thing is also super inconvenient.

291
00:10:07,290 --> 00:10:07,720
I was thinking: "Where are all the celebrities", when I tripped on that thing...
This thing is also super inconvenient.

292
00:10:07,720 --> 00:10:10,260
I was thinking: "Where are all the celebrities", when I tripped on that thing...

293
00:10:13,200 --> 00:10:15,030
It's been 1 hour since the start of the search.

294
00:10:15,970 --> 00:10:18,170
Oh no, it's starting to feel like Jiugaoka all over again.

295
00:10:20,300 --> 00:10:22,710
I'm also starting to get this bad feeling.

296
00:10:22,810 --> 00:10:25,070
-It really feels like Jiugaoka.
-There ain't nobody!

297
00:10:25,480 --> 00:10:26,310
Nobody!

298
00:10:27,040 --> 00:10:27,780
There ain't...

299
00:10:28,850 --> 00:10:32,680
Don't you guys feel like a break already?

300
00:10:33,280 --> 00:10:36,550
Should we have a strategy meeting?

301
00:10:36,820 --> 00:10:37,450
Yeah.

302
00:10:37,850 --> 00:10:38,990
Should we stop somewhere?

303
00:10:39,590 --> 00:10:42,490
Should we look for Damemoto at that OB GYN?

304
00:10:44,930 --> 00:10:46,460
He could be there, you never know.

305
00:10:49,630 --> 00:10:53,070
With that being said, the crew heads to a cafe in hopes to make up a strategy.

306
00:10:53,900 --> 00:10:54,670
Over here, on the terrace.

307
00:10:56,240 --> 00:10:57,310
-Huh?
-I figured.

308
00:10:57,770 --> 00:10:58,680
We'll sit side by side, right?

309
00:10:58,740 --> 00:10:59,740
Over here?

310
00:11:00,910 --> 00:11:03,080
It's gonna look like The Family Game. (1983 Japanese movie directed by Yoshimitsu Morita)

311
00:11:04,310 --> 00:11:05,480
We just need a place where we can look at the street.

312
00:11:05,480 --> 00:11:05,480
Okay.
We just need a place where we can look at the street.

313
00:11:05,480 --> 00:11:05,950
Okay.

314
00:11:06,520 --> 00:11:09,090
Then I'll sit in Juzo Itami's seat.
(Actor that starred in "The Family Game")

315
00:11:10,050 --> 00:11:11,790
Those who aren't seated will be directors.

316
00:11:12,260 --> 00:11:14,360
Who does he play in The Family Game?

317
00:11:14,420 --> 00:11:15,660
-The father.
-The dad.

318
00:11:15,730 --> 00:11:16,090
Oh really?

319
00:11:16,130 --> 00:11:16,660
Yeah.

320
00:11:17,490 --> 00:11:18,160
May we order?

321
00:11:19,160 --> 00:11:20,630
One dark roasted coffee.

322
00:11:21,430 --> 00:11:21,960
And one cafe au lait.

323
00:11:22,230 --> 00:11:22,700
Cafe au lait.

324
00:11:23,230 --> 00:11:24,030
And a ginger ale.

325
00:11:24,100 --> 00:11:24,900
Ginger ale, okay.

326
00:11:25,370 --> 00:11:25,870
Ice coffee for me.

327
00:11:26,070 --> 00:11:26,270
Sure.

328
00:11:27,170 --> 00:11:28,840
-One ice tea, please.
-Sure.

329
00:11:29,670 --> 00:11:31,040
Hold on, this is no good.

330
00:11:32,280 --> 00:11:34,140
There's definitely some celebs around here, but they've sneaking past us.

331
00:11:34,140 --> 00:11:34,580
You think so?
There's definitely some celebs around here, but they've sneaking past us.

332
00:11:34,580 --> 00:11:35,280
You think so?

333
00:11:35,610 --> 00:11:37,410
They're definitely around us.

334
00:11:37,510 --> 00:11:38,720
Yeah, I'm sure of it.

335
00:11:38,780 --> 00:11:40,150
There were definitely 1 or 2 celebrities around.

336
00:11:41,750 --> 00:11:44,190
Ishida said it was pretty scary.

337
00:11:44,890 --> 00:11:45,890
What was scary?

338
00:11:46,360 --> 00:11:46,790
Downtown.

339
00:11:47,720 --> 00:11:48,620
Don't joke around.

340
00:11:48,890 --> 00:11:50,290
He said he was scared of you guys.

341
00:11:51,060 --> 00:11:52,900
He doesn't know what we're filming.

342
00:11:52,900 --> 00:11:53,230
Once they see Downtown, they just run away.
He doesn't know what we're filming.

343
00:11:53,230 --> 00:11:55,500
Once they see Downtown, they just run away.

344
00:11:55,570 --> 00:11:56,330
Downtown-itis.

345
00:11:56,400 --> 00:11:57,270
Downtown-itis, yeah!

346
00:11:58,370 --> 00:12:00,500
Some say everyone has caught it.

347
00:12:01,040 --> 00:12:02,110
Downtown-itis.

348
00:12:04,070 --> 00:12:05,440
What's this?

349
00:12:06,410 --> 00:12:07,310
Oh, thank you.

350
00:12:07,810 --> 00:12:10,210
Their drinks have arrived.

351
00:12:14,150 --> 00:12:16,850
They wet their throats looking for another battle.

352
00:12:19,590 --> 00:12:20,360
It's really good.

353
00:12:20,720 --> 00:12:21,520
It's super good.

354
00:12:21,690 --> 00:12:22,390
Mine is super good as well.

355
00:12:22,430 --> 00:12:26,560
-This is such an authentic ginger ale.

356
00:12:26,900 --> 00:12:27,600
You're right!

357
00:12:27,660 --> 00:12:28,130
Right?

358
00:12:29,700 --> 00:12:31,200
Hey, try this.

359
00:12:32,200 --> 00:12:33,970
It's super authentic!

360
00:12:34,070 --> 00:12:35,940
This ginger ale is super good.

361
00:12:36,210 --> 00:12:38,140
It's the real deal!

362
00:12:38,640 --> 00:12:40,510
It's super dense.

363
00:12:44,380 --> 00:12:45,550
There's tons of ginger in there.

364
00:12:45,550 --> 00:12:46,050
Yeah, a ton!
There's tons of ginger in there.

365
00:12:46,050 --> 00:12:46,450
Yeah, a ton!

366
00:12:46,880 --> 00:12:48,250
This is amazing.

367
00:12:48,850 --> 00:12:49,620
Oh, it's so refreshing.

368
00:12:49,890 --> 00:12:50,250
Right?

369
00:12:50,250 --> 00:12:51,090
It tastes like Hiyashiame.
(Sweet ginger drink that is popular in the Kansai region)

370
00:12:51,190 --> 00:12:51,920
Right, right, right!

371
00:12:51,920 --> 00:12:52,120
Like the ones in Kansai.
Right, right, right!

372
00:12:52,120 --> 00:12:52,620
Like the ones in Kansai.

373
00:12:52,660 --> 00:12:53,120
Totally!

374
00:12:53,160 --> 00:12:54,060
It's super good!

375
00:12:55,260 --> 00:12:56,390
What's the name of this place?

376
00:12:56,390 --> 00:12:58,060
Why aren't you using your own straw?

377
00:12:59,830 --> 00:13:02,830
Everyone was being considerate by drinking from the rim...

378
00:13:03,570 --> 00:13:07,340
And you don't even use the straw... Who's gonna use it now?!

379
00:13:09,670 --> 00:13:11,010
Once again, the guys begin their search.

380
00:13:11,810 --> 00:13:13,540
That's where I wanna head to next.

381
00:13:16,710 --> 00:13:18,450
Even if we go through there, it's hopeless.

382
00:13:18,480 --> 00:13:19,180
Are we all going?

383
00:13:19,680 --> 00:13:21,350
You were all: "It's super good" earlier...

384
00:13:21,450 --> 00:13:22,550
But you're leaving a lot of it!

385
00:13:23,450 --> 00:13:25,520
Let's just try going that way.

386
00:13:25,690 --> 00:13:27,290
The ginger is a bit too harsh for me.

387
00:13:29,590 --> 00:13:31,530
Thank you for the drinks!

388
00:13:32,960 --> 00:13:37,670
We have to put everything back.
You know, I'm the kind of guy that always puts stuff back into place.

389
00:13:38,300 --> 00:13:40,000
I really hate when people do this.

390
00:13:40,640 --> 00:13:42,240
Right? We should take care of this stuff.

391
00:13:43,240 --> 00:13:44,910
It bothers me.

392
00:13:46,410 --> 00:13:47,540
Thank you for the drinks!

393
00:13:48,310 --> 00:13:49,780
And I always thank the staff afterwards.

394
00:13:51,650 --> 00:13:54,750
The other four left Matsumoto behind and pushed onwards.

395
00:13:58,090 --> 00:13:59,660
-That's probably the main street, right?
-Yes.

396
00:14:02,760 --> 00:14:04,360
It's super hot.

397
00:14:06,800 --> 00:14:08,560
And so humid...

398
00:14:09,830 --> 00:14:12,000
I bet some celebrity owns this Benz.

399
00:14:13,900 --> 00:14:14,770
Sure looks like it.

400
00:14:15,040 --> 00:14:16,270
You might be right.

401
00:14:16,810 --> 00:14:19,040
It's like the CEO's car, no?

402
00:14:19,210 --> 00:14:20,340
Yeah, the CEO's car.

403
00:14:20,540 --> 00:14:26,480
You never know, one of our members might get run over and end the shoot.

404
00:14:29,490 --> 00:14:31,650
But then Hamada spots something!

405
00:14:33,690 --> 00:14:35,520
There's someone with a mask over there, who is it?

406
00:14:35,560 --> 00:14:35,990
You're right!

407
00:14:36,360 --> 00:14:37,390
Is she a celebrity?

408
00:14:38,460 --> 00:14:41,800
Hosei runs up to the masked girl without hesitation!

409
00:14:42,500 --> 00:14:42,970
Hello!

410
00:14:43,670 --> 00:14:44,400
Are you a celebrity?

411
00:14:45,230 --> 00:14:47,970
Have they finally found their long awaited celebrity?

412
00:14:49,440 --> 00:14:50,140
Thanks!

413
00:14:55,210 --> 00:14:55,680
What's going on?

414
00:14:57,080 --> 00:14:58,250
It was just a normal person.

415
00:14:58,950 --> 00:15:00,020
But she was wearing a mask...

416
00:15:00,320 --> 00:15:01,520
-Right?
-Yes, she's wearing it because she has the sniffles.

417
00:15:01,780 --> 00:15:02,390
What's with that?

418
00:15:03,090 --> 00:15:05,020
Then why'd you run back to us with such a face of shock?

419
00:15:05,720 --> 00:15:06,890
I don't know...

420
00:15:09,430 --> 00:15:10,490
She had the sniffles, huh?

421
00:15:13,260 --> 00:15:13,830
Alright.

422
00:15:14,500 --> 00:15:16,470
I think it's about time we took a break.

423
00:15:18,200 --> 00:15:20,570
The 246 is that way...

424
00:15:20,970 --> 00:15:22,440
I think we can search that way as well.

425
00:15:22,740 --> 00:15:23,610
-Oh, really?
-Yes.

426
00:15:25,040 --> 00:15:29,910
With that, the guys move towards Don Quixote on highway 246.

427
00:15:31,250 --> 00:15:31,910
We're already here.

428
00:15:32,550 --> 00:15:32,850
Yes.

429
00:15:33,650 --> 00:15:34,280
We're here.

430
00:15:34,920 --> 00:15:35,790
We're here.

431
00:15:37,490 --> 00:15:39,420
If we can't find anyone here it's over, you know?

432
00:15:40,320 --> 00:15:40,990
Tokyo is done for.

433
00:15:41,560 --> 00:15:42,330
There's no one around, huh?

434
00:15:42,630 --> 00:15:44,630
It just means there's no more celebrities in Tokyo.

435
00:15:47,500 --> 00:15:50,130
Don Quixote is a treasure trove of celebrities.

436
00:15:50,430 --> 00:15:51,800
Oh right, we've returned.

437
00:15:53,700 --> 00:15:55,500
They guys have arrived at Don Quixote.

438
00:15:56,540 --> 00:15:57,510
That's ones really good.

439
00:15:57,510 --> 00:15:57,770
And then...
That's ones really good.

440
00:15:57,770 --> 00:15:58,740
And then...

441
00:15:59,140 --> 00:16:00,140
Should we go have a look?

442
00:16:01,310 --> 00:16:01,980
There's Don Quixote.

443
00:16:02,350 --> 00:16:03,610
There's someone over there.

444
00:16:03,610 --> 00:16:03,710
This girl totally looks like it.
There's someone over there.

445
00:16:03,710 --> 00:16:04,850
This girl totally looks like it.

446
00:16:04,980 --> 00:16:05,580
Who? Who? Who?

447
00:16:06,720 --> 00:16:07,480
Ah, excuse me.

448
00:16:08,650 --> 00:16:09,450
Do you have a minute?

449
00:16:10,920 --> 00:16:12,490
You're a celebrity, aren't you?

450
00:16:13,320 --> 00:16:16,160
Have they finally found a celebrity?!

451
00:16:18,160 --> 00:16:19,360
Should we go have a look?

452
00:16:20,500 --> 00:16:21,160
There's Don Quixote.

453
00:16:21,530 --> 00:16:22,900
There's someone over there.

454
00:16:23,030 --> 00:16:23,670
This girl totally looks like it.

455
00:16:24,130 --> 00:16:24,770
Who? Who? Who?

456
00:16:25,940 --> 00:16:26,700
Ah, excuse me.

457
00:16:27,840 --> 00:16:28,470
Do you have a minute?

458
00:16:29,770 --> 00:16:31,440
You're a celebrity, aren't you?

459
00:16:31,540 --> 00:16:32,040
A model?

460
00:16:34,480 --> 00:16:34,940
Model?

461
00:16:34,980 --> 00:16:36,910
I have work now, I have an audition.

462
00:16:37,110 --> 00:16:37,980
What kind of audition?

463
00:16:38,780 --> 00:16:40,020
It's for makeup.

464
00:16:40,220 --> 00:16:40,950
Makeup? See?

465
00:16:41,680 --> 00:16:42,250
I told you!

466
00:16:42,650 --> 00:16:43,950
Hold on, just give us 1 minute.

467
00:16:46,220 --> 00:16:46,760
What's going on?

468
00:16:47,720 --> 00:16:50,090
She's got an audition for some makeup.

469
00:16:50,090 --> 00:16:50,730
-Hamada!
-Please hold on.
She's got an audition for some makeup.

470
00:16:50,730 --> 00:16:51,260
-Hamada!
-Please hold on.

471
00:16:51,330 --> 00:16:52,530
I'm actually in an agency already.

472
00:16:52,960 --> 00:16:54,060
Is he inside?

473
00:16:54,200 --> 00:16:55,730
Just a minute... Are you okay on time?

474
00:16:55,900 --> 00:16:57,570
But you have an audition right now, don't you?

475
00:16:57,570 --> 00:16:58,700
She doesn't wanna be on camera without makeup!
But you have an audition right now, don't you?

476
00:16:58,700 --> 00:16:59,240
She doesn't wanna be on camera without makeup!

477
00:16:59,500 --> 00:17:01,400
I don't think that's true.

478
00:17:02,070 --> 00:17:03,070
I'm not famous or anything!

479
00:17:03,070 --> 00:17:03,710
Could you just tell us your name?
I'm not famous or anything!

480
00:17:03,710 --> 00:17:04,840
Could you just tell us your name?

481
00:17:04,870 --> 00:17:06,410
I'm A-Azusa Azuma.

482
00:17:06,410 --> 00:17:07,240
Azusa Azuma!

483
00:17:07,840 --> 00:17:08,610
I dunno!

484
00:17:08,610 --> 00:17:09,510
I have no clue.

485
00:17:09,580 --> 00:17:10,710
It's Azusa Azuma!

486
00:17:11,610 --> 00:17:12,980
It's Az Az!

487
00:17:13,220 --> 00:17:15,120
Is that Ms. Azuma?!

488
00:17:16,450 --> 00:17:19,590
She is a model, Azusa Azuma!

489
00:17:19,920 --> 00:17:20,690
However...

490
00:17:21,160 --> 00:17:22,690
Could you take off your glasses for us?

491
00:17:22,790 --> 00:17:24,290
-She's called Azusa Azuma.
-You're very cute.

492
00:17:24,960 --> 00:17:25,960
Azusa Azuma.

493
00:17:26,400 --> 00:17:27,500
She's got an audition.

494
00:17:27,800 --> 00:17:28,900
-Yes.
-Oh, is that so?

495
00:17:29,000 --> 00:17:30,530
You'll be late, right?

496
00:17:31,200 --> 00:17:31,730
Sorry about this.

497
00:17:31,730 --> 00:17:31,730
But I'm so happy I met you guys.
Sorry about this.

498
00:17:31,730 --> 00:17:32,540
But I'm so happy I met you guys.

499
00:17:38,210 --> 00:17:39,980
I knew immediately.

500
00:17:39,980 --> 00:17:41,080
She was a no-go from the start.

501
00:17:41,080 --> 00:17:41,140
But I like how proactive you are.
She was a no-go from the start.

502
00:17:41,140 --> 00:17:43,550
But I like how proactive you are.

503
00:17:43,710 --> 00:17:44,450
Right?

504
00:17:45,110 --> 00:17:49,290
Let's split up.
Some of us go to Don Quixote and the rest go around the block.

505
00:17:49,320 --> 00:17:50,650
Alright, I'm going to Don Quixote.

506
00:17:51,020 --> 00:17:53,190
Cocorico will search the inside of the store.

507
00:17:54,690 --> 00:17:56,990
This one's also a Don Quixote.

508
00:17:57,260 --> 00:17:57,760
-Oh, really?
-Yes

509
00:17:57,760 --> 00:17:57,960
Yeah, this one's also a Don Quixote.
-Oh, really?
-Yes

510
00:17:57,960 --> 00:17:58,860
Yeah, this one's also a Don Quixote.

511
00:18:02,430 --> 00:18:06,170
Downtown and Hosei will look around the block.

512
00:18:07,200 --> 00:18:09,240
This has got to be the center of Sangenjaya!

513
00:18:10,040 --> 00:18:13,240
I say this because we just ran into Azusa Azuma, Az Az.

514
00:18:13,580 --> 00:18:13,980
Ah!

515
00:18:15,680 --> 00:18:16,150
You found someone?!

516
00:18:18,650 --> 00:18:19,250
Who?! Who?!

517
00:18:23,720 --> 00:18:25,020
Gaki-no-Tsukai News!

518
00:18:25,720 --> 00:18:29,060
Shiodome Paradise will be unveiled on July 25th!

519
00:18:29,660 --> 00:18:32,660
This bus will be full of Gaki-no-Tsukai fun!

520
00:18:33,260 --> 00:18:36,770
We'll dive into the uncharted territory of comedy.
We'll be waiting for you!

521
00:18:37,600 --> 00:18:39,640
This has got to be the center of Sangenjaya!

522
00:18:40,540 --> 00:18:43,770
I say this because we just ran into Azusa Azuma, Az Az.

523
00:18:44,170 --> 00:18:44,610
Ah!

524
00:18:46,210 --> 00:18:46,710
You found someone?!

525
00:18:49,150 --> 00:18:49,850
Who?! Who?!

526
00:18:52,750 --> 00:18:53,950
What are you doing here?!

527
00:18:54,480 --> 00:18:56,450
You've got tons of tissues!

528
00:18:57,820 --> 00:18:59,260
Hold on, this is so raw!

529
00:19:00,390 --> 00:19:01,790
It's totally unadulterated!

530
00:19:03,530 --> 00:19:04,830
Hold on, what's going on?

531
00:19:04,930 --> 00:19:05,860
That's amazing!

532
00:19:06,700 --> 00:19:08,730
It's so raw! Super raw!

533
00:19:08,760 --> 00:19:10,000
Excuse me.

534
00:19:10,200 --> 00:19:11,030
What were you doing?

535
00:19:12,030 --> 00:19:13,200
I was just doing some shopping.

536
00:19:13,700 --> 00:19:15,170
Why do you have this many tissues?

537
00:19:16,040 --> 00:19:17,370
Well, they were pretty cheap so...

538
00:19:17,610 --> 00:19:19,480
Would you even use this much?

539
00:19:20,040 --> 00:19:21,480
You didn't buy anything hard.

540
00:19:21,710 --> 00:19:23,280
It's all soft stuff.

541
00:19:25,510 --> 00:19:26,580
You're a softie!

542
00:19:28,520 --> 00:19:29,690
But I'm so happy!

543
00:19:30,390 --> 00:19:33,590
You'll get the clear if all 5 of you can name him.

544
00:19:33,620 --> 00:19:34,720
Sure, of course.

545
00:19:35,160 --> 00:19:36,430
You have to say the group's name and his name.

546
00:19:38,790 --> 00:19:39,060
Huh?

547
00:19:40,060 --> 00:19:41,260
I know it, I know.

548
00:19:41,800 --> 00:19:42,400
Don't worry.

549
00:19:43,130 --> 00:19:44,230
Then let's start with Endo.

550
00:19:44,430 --> 00:19:45,530
We can't do that!

551
00:19:46,370 --> 00:19:47,440
We have to all do it together.

552
00:19:48,140 --> 00:19:49,670
We all have to say it together!

553
00:19:49,810 --> 00:19:51,410
You guys don't remember me?

554
00:19:52,310 --> 00:19:54,510
Of course we do! We remember you!

555
00:19:54,540 --> 00:19:55,410
Of course we remember!

556
00:19:55,440 --> 00:19:56,510
You're Matsuo's partner, aren't you?

557
00:19:56,510 --> 00:19:57,010
Right?

558
00:19:57,850 --> 00:19:59,150
He's Matsuo's partner!

559
00:19:59,380 --> 00:20:00,350
That's right.

560
00:20:00,620 --> 00:20:02,050
You have that bit where you go, "So frustrating!".

561
00:20:04,020 --> 00:20:04,990
So frustrating!

562
00:20:05,220 --> 00:20:08,920
Will the guys be able to say his name?

563
00:20:09,960 --> 00:20:11,190
One, two, three...

564
00:20:11,890 --> 00:20:14,800
Zabungle's Kato!

565
00:20:15,630 --> 00:20:16,270
You guys know.

566
00:20:17,670 --> 00:20:18,700
Okay.

567
00:20:18,830 --> 00:20:20,070
That's amazing!

568
00:20:20,300 --> 00:20:21,270
We did well.

569
00:20:22,340 --> 00:20:23,540
I knew it perfectly!

570
00:20:23,940 --> 00:20:25,270
Say again then.

571
00:20:25,370 --> 00:20:26,980
Zabungle's Kato, right?

572
00:20:26,980 --> 00:20:27,610
That's right.

573
00:20:29,310 --> 00:20:33,680
Now, all that's left is to receive approval from his agency.

574
00:20:34,780 --> 00:20:35,650
They said it's okay.

575
00:20:35,680 --> 00:20:36,050
It's okay!

576
00:20:36,120 --> 00:20:37,650
Watanabe Entertainment said it's okay.

577
00:20:39,020 --> 00:20:40,520
We got the clear!

578
00:20:40,790 --> 00:20:44,690
After 1 hour and 52 minutes, the guys have completed the mission!

579
00:20:45,290 --> 00:20:46,430
Did you park your car nearby?

580
00:20:46,730 --> 00:20:48,500
Not at all, I just walked.

581
00:20:48,700 --> 00:20:49,470
Is your house that close?

582
00:20:49,500 --> 00:20:50,270
Yes.

583
00:20:50,570 --> 00:20:51,600
So you're walking home?

584
00:20:51,600 --> 00:20:52,530
Yes, of course.

585
00:20:52,570 --> 00:20:53,870
Your house is super closeby, right?

586
00:20:54,000 --> 00:20:54,970
Yes, it's very close.

587
00:20:54,970 --> 00:20:56,240
Then let's go to your house.

588
00:20:56,370 --> 00:20:57,140
What?!

589
00:20:59,940 --> 00:21:01,240
-We have to!
-Should we?

590
00:21:01,240 --> 00:21:01,710
For real?!

591
00:21:01,780 --> 00:21:03,580
You live super close, we have to visit.

592
00:21:03,810 --> 00:21:04,550
Let's go then.

593
00:21:04,980 --> 00:21:06,080
-Is it close?
-Seriously?!

594
00:21:06,320 --> 00:21:07,380
Is there someone home?

595
00:21:07,420 --> 00:21:08,820
-Sure, let's go, let's go.
-Well, my wife's home.

596
00:21:08,820 --> 00:21:09,390
Which way? That way?
-Sure, let's go, let's go.
-Well, my wife's home.

597
00:21:09,390 --> 00:21:09,820
Which way? That way?

598
00:21:10,120 --> 00:21:10,890
You have a wife?!

599
00:21:10,990 --> 00:21:12,590
I do, and 2 children.

600
00:21:12,690 --> 00:21:13,720
I see!

601
00:21:13,920 --> 00:21:15,620
You looked super shocked.

602
00:21:16,190 --> 00:21:17,830
Well, that's just natural.

603
00:21:19,630 --> 00:21:24,670
With that being said, we decided to barge in on the Kato household.

604
00:21:25,630 --> 00:21:29,170
How long were you shopping before we found you?

605
00:21:30,010 --> 00:21:32,640
Well, I got out of the house about 10 minutes ago.

606
00:21:32,710 --> 00:21:33,710
10 minutes?!

607
00:21:34,110 --> 00:21:34,980
10 minutes?!

608
00:21:35,240 --> 00:21:36,310
We found you very quickly.

609
00:21:36,310 --> 00:21:37,450
But what a coincidence!

610
00:21:37,610 --> 00:21:39,080
I'm so glad!

611
00:21:39,080 --> 00:21:39,980
We can finally go home.

612
00:21:39,980 --> 00:21:40,180
That's amazing.
We can finally go home.

613
00:21:40,180 --> 00:21:40,880
That's amazing.

614
00:21:43,220 --> 00:21:43,590
I thought we'd never go home.

615
00:21:43,590 --> 00:21:44,220
-Please let me put a mic on you.
-Oh sure.
I thought we'd never go home.

616
00:21:44,220 --> 00:21:45,090
-Please let me put a mic on you.
-Oh sure.

617
00:21:45,750 --> 00:21:46,390
Of course!

618
00:21:48,720 --> 00:21:51,290
But we really caught you in the wild.

619
00:21:51,960 --> 00:21:53,100
I'm sorry about that.

620
00:21:53,130 --> 00:21:54,500
No, no, don't worry.

621
00:21:55,260 --> 00:21:56,930
But we really caught you in the wild.

622
00:21:57,430 --> 00:21:58,670
For real...

623
00:21:59,570 --> 00:22:01,840
We caught you right in the middle of your daily life.

624
00:22:02,640 --> 00:22:03,540
Celebrities do hang around here.

625
00:22:03,540 --> 00:22:04,410
-Right?
-Right!

626
00:22:05,840 --> 00:22:07,680
It's about a minute away.

627
00:22:07,840 --> 00:22:08,710
Don't you have to buy that one?

628
00:22:08,780 --> 00:22:10,650
I already bought this much.

629
00:22:10,910 --> 00:22:12,450
But that one looks pretty cheap.

630
00:22:13,520 --> 00:22:14,680
-This one was cheaper.
-Are you sure?

631
00:22:15,150 --> 00:22:16,450
Come on already.

632
00:22:17,050 --> 00:22:18,090
Stop it.

633
00:22:19,660 --> 00:22:22,590
We arrived at the Kato household after a few minutes.

634
00:22:24,630 --> 00:22:26,400
Excuse us!

635
00:22:27,530 --> 00:22:28,530
Excuse us!

636
00:22:28,760 --> 00:22:29,160
What?!

637
00:22:29,200 --> 00:22:30,830
We're here with your husband...

638
00:22:30,930 --> 00:22:32,070
-Hello!
-Hello.

639
00:22:34,500 --> 00:22:35,870
Oh, hello!

640
00:22:36,170 --> 00:22:38,370
-We just found him doing some shopping.
-Right.

641
00:22:38,870 --> 00:22:40,310
He was holding a mountain of toilet paper.

642
00:22:41,340 --> 00:22:42,110
Is that so?

643
00:22:43,210 --> 00:22:44,380
Oh, there we go.

644
00:22:45,980 --> 00:22:46,780
Ma'am, excuse our intrusion.

645
00:22:47,380 --> 00:22:49,520
Excuse us. Sorry!

646
00:22:50,450 --> 00:22:52,220
-Excuse us.
-Oh, hello there little guy.

647
00:22:52,390 --> 00:22:53,020
How old is he?

648
00:22:53,760 --> 00:22:54,590
He'll be 1 soon.

649
00:22:54,720 --> 00:22:55,460
1 year old!

650
00:22:56,260 --> 00:22:57,260
That's amazing.

651
00:22:58,530 --> 00:22:59,290
Is he a boy?

652
00:22:59,360 --> 00:23:00,260
-Yes, he's a boy.
-Sorry, sorry.

653
00:23:00,960 --> 00:23:01,830
Ah, he's crying.

654
00:23:03,300 --> 00:23:04,700
Yama, stop it.

655
00:23:05,500 --> 00:23:07,970
You can't be doing that.

656
00:23:08,470 --> 00:23:09,470
Right.

657
00:23:10,070 --> 00:23:11,140
Guess he doesn't like being touched.

658
00:23:11,140 --> 00:23:11,470
You just scared him.
Guess he doesn't like being touched.

659
00:23:11,470 --> 00:23:12,510
You just scared him.

660
00:23:13,280 --> 00:23:14,040
Were you scared?

661
00:23:14,510 --> 00:23:15,440
Poor guy.

662
00:23:15,480 --> 00:23:16,710
Right? I wanna crash right here.

663
00:23:16,910 --> 00:23:18,080
How long have you lived here?

664
00:23:18,410 --> 00:23:19,010
About 4 years...

665
00:23:19,250 --> 00:23:20,280
4 years?

666
00:23:20,780 --> 00:23:22,120
She's cooking and we barged in here...

667
00:23:22,420 --> 00:23:23,250
We're bothering her.

668
00:23:23,520 --> 00:23:24,950
We have to go home soon.

669
00:23:25,020 --> 00:23:25,650
We're not eating?

670
00:23:26,820 --> 00:23:27,890
How many nights can we stay?

671
00:23:27,890 --> 00:23:28,120
What are you on about?!
How many nights can we stay?

672
00:23:28,120 --> 00:23:29,120
What are you on about?!

673
00:23:29,320 --> 00:23:30,660
How many nights will you have us?

674
00:23:31,230 --> 00:23:32,900
-But anyway, thank you for inviting us is.
-Oh, you're welcome anytime.

675
00:23:33,960 --> 00:23:34,700
Sorry about all this.

676
00:23:34,730 --> 00:23:35,130
Thanks.

677
00:23:35,530 --> 00:23:37,070
We will be using this footage.

678
00:23:37,600 --> 00:23:37,830
Right?

679
00:23:38,300 --> 00:23:39,970
Sorry, I don't think my agency will allow it.

680
00:23:40,300 --> 00:23:41,370
Ouch!

681
00:23:42,300 --> 00:23:44,270
His dad is getting smacked and the son goes like this.

682
00:23:46,740 --> 00:23:48,540
He never sees this!

683
00:23:48,580 --> 00:23:51,780
He was so shocked when he smacked him.

684
00:23:55,250 --> 00:23:58,890
The Yamazaki vs Moriman series is finally getting a Blu-ray release!

685
00:23:59,590 --> 00:24:02,620
Yamazaki's wonderful defeats are making a comeback!

686
00:24:03,390 --> 00:24:06,330
A selection of the best shows and a talk-show compilation are getting re-released!

687
