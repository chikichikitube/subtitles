Subbed by Thanos-no-Tsukai
Thanks For Watching!

2
00:00:23,890 --> 00:00:25,790
I'm Kataoka Ainosuke (Editor's Note 1)

3
00:00:27,390 --> 00:00:30,330
Okay, so today... um...

4
00:00:30,390 --> 00:00:32,060
We're doing "Documental"...

5
00:00:33,630 --> 00:00:36,200
I kind of want Norika to see... (EN: 2)

6
00:00:36,270 --> 00:00:38,700
something quite interesting.

7
00:00:38,770 --> 00:00:40,040
Okay. Sorry, that was too simple.

8
00:00:40,100 --> 00:00:41,570
No, that was a great impersonation.

9
00:00:42,000 --> 00:00:44,010
I haven't had much chance to practice,

10
00:00:44,070 --> 00:00:47,880
so just leaving one or two impressions,
would make me happy.

11
00:00:48,080 --> 00:00:49,110
There it is, there it is.

12
00:00:50,550 --> 00:00:52,050
It went that way, sorry.

13
00:00:52,110 --> 00:00:53,680
A last one, a last one. Sorry.

14
00:00:54,750 --> 00:00:56,820
Everyone is doing their best with gags.

15
00:00:57,190 --> 00:00:59,560
I don't think there are any comedians

16
00:00:59,820 --> 00:01:01,520
that don't do gags one way or another.

17
00:01:01,590 --> 00:01:04,330
Because they have a keen eye different from other people,

18
00:01:04,530 --> 00:01:07,330
and can tell what's funny and what isn't.

19
00:01:07,400 --> 00:01:09,230
I didn't have any intention

20
00:01:09,530 --> 00:01:11,170
to play the straight man.

21
00:02:19,170 --> 00:02:21,040
A grandma's is more like this...
See?

22
00:02:21,100 --> 00:02:24,070
And an electric one is more like that.

23
00:02:31,810 --> 00:02:32,820
So he's out?

24
00:02:32,880 --> 00:02:35,520
You're out!

25
00:02:35,580 --> 00:02:38,350
This is Wangan!
Wangan! Wangan!

26
00:02:38,420 --> 00:02:43,490
Wangan! Wangan!

27
00:02:43,560 --> 00:02:45,290
Alright! He did it!

28
00:02:46,300 --> 00:02:48,200
Matsuo, you're out!

29
00:02:57,770 --> 00:02:58,770
Here we go.

30
00:03:01,010 --> 00:03:02,080
I'll do it with my phone.

31
00:03:02,140 --> 00:03:04,010
— How?
— Just connect it.

32
00:03:04,710 --> 00:03:06,050
Do we have any coffee?

33
00:03:06,120 --> 00:03:07,250
I want some coffee.

34
00:03:07,320 --> 00:03:09,550
How do you make coffee?

35
00:03:09,620 --> 00:03:11,420
Coffee? You do it here, like...

36
00:03:11,420 --> 00:03:12,350
You come here and—

37
00:03:12,690 --> 00:03:14,260
Someone's...
Someone's here!

38
00:03:16,860 --> 00:03:18,660
Excuse me, I am Shireman Peter

39
00:03:18,730 --> 00:03:20,360
from Yoshimoto Entertainment.

40
00:03:20,430 --> 00:03:22,300
And he is a fellow employee.

41
00:03:22,360 --> 00:03:24,930
I'm Jaratiyaka Virendla
from Yoshimoto Entertainment.

42
00:03:25,000 --> 00:03:26,100
— Who are they?
— So you're...

43
00:03:26,170 --> 00:03:28,000
...the guys from the contract, right?

44
00:03:28,070 --> 00:03:29,370
— That's right.
— Seiji-san?

45
00:03:29,440 --> 00:03:31,240
— A contract?
— Here and now?

46
00:03:31,310 --> 00:03:32,680
They had foreigners like that?

47
00:03:32,740 --> 00:03:33,740
Is everything okay?

48
00:03:33,810 --> 00:03:35,110
What's your position?

49
00:03:35,180 --> 00:03:36,680
I'm in the sports department at the moment.

50
00:03:36,750 --> 00:03:38,610
— Sports?
— This is none of our business.

51
00:03:38,680 --> 00:03:41,780
We're employees.
From the Corporate's Main Branch.

52
00:03:41,980 --> 00:03:44,490
The Sports Department is here to sign a contract?

53
00:03:44,550 --> 00:03:46,190
— That's right.
— Seiji-san?

54
00:03:46,260 --> 00:03:47,420
— We're doing it for Seiji-san.
— Why?

55
00:03:47,490 --> 00:03:49,020
Seiji-san, are you signing a sports contract?

56
00:03:49,090 --> 00:03:51,890
No clue. We didn't talk things through the other day.

57
00:03:52,090 --> 00:03:53,530
About the contract.

58
00:03:54,100 --> 00:03:55,100
You should've gotten that done with.

59
00:03:55,160 --> 00:03:57,570
Then why don't you guys do it with me?

60
00:03:57,630 --> 00:03:59,170
We're not doing sports!

61
00:03:59,500 --> 00:04:02,740
But in the end it's the same, right?
Sports and comedy.

62
00:04:02,810 --> 00:04:04,670
Please take a look if you're participating.

63
00:04:04,740 --> 00:04:07,140
But when I did this before,

64
00:04:07,210 --> 00:04:11,410
they told me to take it with me, and so...

65
00:04:11,480 --> 00:04:15,680
I had a particular condition, that I wouldn't look at stuff that arrived while at work,

66
00:04:15,920 --> 00:04:17,950
if I had to split earnings.

67
00:04:19,920 --> 00:04:22,190
So that's...

68
00:04:22,630 --> 00:04:24,730
...why are you people speaking English now?!

69
00:04:27,160 --> 00:04:28,430
No splitting is crazy, man.

70
00:04:28,500 --> 00:04:30,270
That's insane, Seiji.

71
00:04:31,270 --> 00:04:32,270
That's completely impossible.

72
00:04:34,340 --> 00:04:35,870
What are they saying?

73
00:04:36,140 --> 00:04:38,140
I'm making life changing decisions,

74
00:04:38,210 --> 00:04:40,480
so please don't speak in a language I can't understand!

75
00:04:40,540 --> 00:04:41,780
We're sorry...

76
00:04:43,010 --> 00:04:44,650
— They don't get this!
— Seiji, Seiji, Seiji...

77
00:04:44,710 --> 00:04:46,620
Don't say that.

78
00:04:46,680 --> 00:04:48,450
Seiji is smiling for sure, though!

79
00:04:49,690 --> 00:04:51,950
Can't you speak in English about that over there?

80
00:04:52,390 --> 00:04:53,660
We can't speak Japanese right now, so...

81
00:04:53,720 --> 00:04:55,590
Why?

82
00:04:55,660 --> 00:04:57,760
Why?

83
00:04:57,830 --> 00:04:58,830
It's easier for us in English.

84
00:04:58,890 --> 00:05:01,560
Why?! Why?!

85
00:05:01,630 --> 00:05:02,730
What's the deal with that?

86
00:05:02,800 --> 00:05:04,700
We're very sorry, but with our current skill level,

87
00:05:04,770 --> 00:05:06,800
we can't speak much more than that.

88
00:05:07,140 --> 00:05:08,740
They could be talking behind your back, you know?

89
00:05:09,640 --> 00:05:10,640
Is it a serious contract?

90
00:05:10,710 --> 00:05:12,780
It's serious, yeah.

91
00:05:12,780 --> 00:05:16,410
Yeah, that's why I'm so confused with these two,
when it's such a serious matter.

92
00:05:16,410 --> 00:05:20,020
Maybe they're just underestimating you a little,
Seiji. I think that's it.

93
00:05:20,250 --> 00:05:21,450
I think so as well.

94
00:05:21,520 --> 00:05:23,090
They're definitely looking down on you.

95
00:05:26,190 --> 00:05:29,220
He's smiling.
He's smiling for sure.

96
00:05:31,330 --> 00:05:33,660
They're definitely looking down on me with this.

97
00:05:33,660 --> 00:05:35,230
We think it would be necessary to negotiate.

98
00:05:35,230 --> 00:05:37,530
But you see, this just doesn't...

99
00:05:38,330 --> 00:05:41,170
We can't do this with a guy like this.

100
00:05:42,910 --> 00:05:44,970
He looks like Yamamoto Tarou. (EN: 3)

101
00:05:54,820 --> 00:05:56,220
This can be trouble later, though.

102
00:05:56,290 --> 00:05:57,650
Trouble...?

103
00:05:57,720 --> 00:06:01,820
When I'm signing a contract that will change my life,

104
00:06:02,290 --> 00:06:04,030
this is just no good.

105
00:06:04,560 --> 00:06:05,890
Besides, I'm signing a contract

106
00:06:05,960 --> 00:06:07,800
with Yoshimoto in the middle of "Documental".

107
00:06:07,860 --> 00:06:09,570
That's one big forehead, huh?

108
00:06:10,970 --> 00:06:12,000
For real.

109
00:06:13,270 --> 00:06:15,500
This isn't going to work out without some English.

110
00:06:15,800 --> 00:06:16,810
Tell him.

111
00:06:31,420 --> 00:06:33,120
I am very sorry. This is very important,

112
00:06:33,190 --> 00:06:34,620
and we know you're busy right now.

113
00:06:34,860 --> 00:06:38,060
We're not even having a conversation like this.

114
00:06:38,130 --> 00:06:39,460
Just sign it.

115
00:06:39,700 --> 00:06:42,800
Now that these two came here like this,

116
00:06:42,870 --> 00:06:44,200
it's just like Fujimon was saying.

117
00:06:44,270 --> 00:06:46,240
I know you're in the same generation, but...

118
00:06:46,300 --> 00:06:48,300
...they're looking down on you.

119
00:06:48,500 --> 00:06:50,540
Not at all.

120
00:06:51,240 --> 00:06:53,180
That's why I had you take a picture,

121
00:06:53,240 --> 00:06:56,040
when guys like these show up, right?

122
00:06:59,480 --> 00:07:02,250
We're signing a contract...

123
00:07:05,690 --> 00:07:08,720
...with an attitude like this?

124
00:07:12,160 --> 00:07:15,200
This isn't even a conversation anymore.
Take this and please leave.

125
00:07:15,260 --> 00:07:17,370
Sorry. It's just...

126
00:07:17,430 --> 00:07:18,570
I'm sorry.

127
00:07:18,630 --> 00:07:20,700
Let's do it again. Again.

128
00:07:20,770 --> 00:07:22,440
No, twice more.

129
00:07:22,810 --> 00:07:25,110
Two more.

130
00:07:25,170 --> 00:07:26,540
— Sorry.
— We're very sorry.

131
00:07:27,910 --> 00:07:29,240
Let's meet next time.

132
00:07:29,310 --> 00:07:31,310
— Good job.
— I feel sorry for them.

133
00:07:31,380 --> 00:07:33,380
— That was hard.
— Come on, man, that was just...

134
00:07:33,450 --> 00:07:35,420
It was hard.

135
00:07:35,780 --> 00:07:37,250
Let's just have them leave.

136
00:07:38,290 --> 00:07:39,760
I guess a lot happened, huh?

137
00:07:40,860 --> 00:07:41,860
Peter.

138
00:07:43,560 --> 00:07:44,790
Bananas are great.

139
00:07:44,860 --> 00:07:46,160
Love stories.
Again?

140
00:07:48,230 --> 00:07:50,370
— Love story?
— Me?

141
00:07:50,870 --> 00:07:53,100
I got a girlfriend recently,

142
00:07:53,170 --> 00:07:54,800
so yesterday we went out to pick strawberries.

143
00:07:54,870 --> 00:07:56,870
And I was very nervous.

144
00:07:56,940 --> 00:07:58,610
I was thinking about today all the time.

145
00:07:58,670 --> 00:08:01,310
I was just thinking about Seiji-san's contract,

146
00:08:01,380 --> 00:08:02,680
and I didn't pay any attention.

147
00:08:02,740 --> 00:08:04,980
So my girlfriend got a little upset.
I'm very sorry.

148
00:08:05,050 --> 00:08:06,150
She's still angry?

149
00:08:06,220 --> 00:08:08,250
I just couldn't get Seiji-san out of my head.

150
00:08:08,250 --> 00:08:11,000
I couldn't even think about my girlfriend.
I didn't care about the strawberries.

151
00:08:11,020 --> 00:08:12,960
If you say that...

152
00:08:13,020 --> 00:08:14,490
It's all Seiji-san's fault.

153
00:08:14,560 --> 00:08:16,360
Even if you say that, it's not my fault.

154
00:08:16,430 --> 00:08:19,630
But now I think I brought someone bad luck.

155
00:08:19,700 --> 00:08:23,500
But he couldn't concentrate on picking strawberries.

156
00:08:27,470 --> 00:08:29,170
A story you remember well.

157
00:08:35,940 --> 00:08:38,010
That's difficult...

158
00:08:49,220 --> 00:08:50,230
You can do it in Japanese.

159
00:08:50,290 --> 00:08:51,660
Yeah, Japanese is fine.

160
00:08:54,700 --> 00:08:58,500
A story that I remember well...

161
00:09:11,350 --> 00:09:12,920
Back when I had hair,

162
00:09:12,980 --> 00:09:15,820
I was a newscaster on TV.

163
00:09:15,880 --> 00:09:17,950
— Amazing.
— On a national network.

164
00:09:18,020 --> 00:09:19,760
You were a newscaster?

165
00:09:19,820 --> 00:09:20,820
Where?

166
00:09:20,890 --> 00:09:21,890
Sri Lanka, my home country.

167
00:09:21,960 --> 00:09:23,330
Sri Lanka?

168
00:09:23,390 --> 00:09:25,560
You were a newscaster back home?

169
00:09:25,630 --> 00:09:28,730
I see!

170
00:09:37,470 --> 00:09:39,140
I think that's enough.

171
00:09:39,210 --> 00:09:40,340
Sorry, it's just...

172
00:09:40,410 --> 00:09:41,640
Good job!

173
00:09:42,540 --> 00:09:43,880
You were here a long time.

174
00:09:43,950 --> 00:09:45,110
That was long.

175
00:09:45,180 --> 00:09:46,680
Just look at the contract, man!

176
00:09:46,750 --> 00:09:49,050
Everything about the contract was Seiji's fault.

177
00:09:49,120 --> 00:09:50,990
I can't do that under conditions like that!

178
00:09:51,050 --> 00:09:52,650
Of course you can!

179
00:09:53,220 --> 00:09:54,920
What are you doing?

180
00:09:55,860 --> 00:09:57,630
Wanna do the Yoshimoto Quiz Lumine?

181
00:09:57,690 --> 00:09:59,060
You were talking about that for a while, huh?

182
00:09:59,130 --> 00:10:01,930
He has wanted to do it for a while.

183
00:10:02,000 --> 00:10:04,030
What's the Yoshimoto Quiz Lumine?

184
00:10:04,100 --> 00:10:05,700
Just do the Yoshimoto Quiz Lumine once,

185
00:10:05,770 --> 00:10:06,770
together with us.

186
00:10:06,840 --> 00:10:10,370
— Just once.
— Can you get it right?

187
00:10:10,940 --> 00:10:15,310
I think I've maxed out my skills recently.

188
00:10:15,380 --> 00:10:17,050
No way, that's amazing!

189
00:10:17,110 --> 00:10:19,310
And so, having done that,

190
00:10:19,380 --> 00:10:21,620
it might be a bit unfair.

191
00:10:22,080 --> 00:10:25,620
I mean, that's what I think, I guess.

192
00:10:25,690 --> 00:10:27,190
So I'd like you to play the best three.

193
00:10:27,260 --> 00:10:28,960
That's from Fujita's perspective?

194
00:10:29,460 --> 00:10:30,860
What should we guess correctly?

195
00:10:30,930 --> 00:10:32,460
— First place.
— That's someone's name.

196
00:10:32,660 --> 00:10:34,960
So we just have to guess the best three.

197
00:10:35,030 --> 00:10:38,100
The question is, um...

198
00:10:38,170 --> 00:10:40,670
Who's the most likely to go home immediately,

199
00:10:41,270 --> 00:10:45,170
after the show is over. That's the ranking.

200
00:10:45,240 --> 00:10:47,010
Ah, I get it now.

201
00:10:47,080 --> 00:10:48,780
There are some people like that, right?

202
00:10:48,840 --> 00:10:50,950
A ranking of who goes home first?

203
00:10:51,010 --> 00:10:53,120
So someone who looks like they'd run off immediately?

204
00:10:53,320 --> 00:10:55,780
I don't think there's anyone exactly like that, but...

205
00:10:55,850 --> 00:10:58,750
— Let's do this already!
— There are no absolutes, okay?

206
00:10:58,950 --> 00:10:59,960
Third place!

207
00:11:00,190 --> 00:11:01,990
— A quiz already?
— Come on already!

208
00:11:02,060 --> 00:11:03,130
So who's in third place?

209
00:11:03,190 --> 00:11:04,630
No, no, let's start from first place. (EN: 4)

210
00:11:04,690 --> 00:11:06,130
— Show it on the count of three!
— Three, two...

211
00:11:06,700 --> 00:11:08,330
We just have to guess who the hell is in first place.

212
00:11:08,400 --> 00:11:11,330
But we can't do this if we don't catch your drift in the first place!

213
00:11:11,400 --> 00:11:13,540
Like, what happens when you say "this is first place"?

214
00:11:13,700 --> 00:11:14,870
I open the first place.

215
00:11:14,940 --> 00:11:16,640
— That's no fun!
— It's fun!

216
00:11:16,710 --> 00:11:18,940
You should just count down from three!

217
00:11:19,010 --> 00:11:20,710
That doesn't matter, just get it right!

218
00:11:20,780 --> 00:11:22,440
We can't predict or adjust for trends!

219
00:11:22,510 --> 00:11:24,110
You can if you guess second place!

220
00:11:24,180 --> 00:11:25,480
In any case just show us third place!

221
00:11:25,550 --> 00:11:27,050
— Come on already!
— Why third place?

222
00:11:27,120 --> 00:11:28,480
Just do this already.

223
00:11:28,480 --> 00:11:30,950
— Just get it right!
— Do third place already!

224
00:11:31,020 --> 00:11:33,060
— Then get it damned right!
— Show it to us!

225
00:11:33,120 --> 00:11:34,920
That's Maeda-san from the hurricanes.

226
00:11:35,460 --> 00:11:37,530
Maeda-san from the hurricanes?

227
00:11:37,590 --> 00:11:39,490
We have time, so show us third place.

228
00:11:39,560 --> 00:11:41,260
Open third place already!

229
00:11:41,600 --> 00:11:44,200
I have to do it for you?!

230
00:11:44,370 --> 00:11:46,770
Show us third place!

231
00:11:50,070 --> 00:11:52,310
Past Tsutsumishita.

232
00:11:53,410 --> 00:11:54,940
So... So...

233
00:11:55,180 --> 00:11:57,580
— "Past"?
— That's the name of his act?

234
00:11:58,610 --> 00:12:00,420
That's why I told you to show us, we can't pick up any patterns.

235
00:12:00,780 --> 00:12:02,920
Any others have additional stuff like that?

236
00:12:02,980 --> 00:12:04,420
They all have things added to them?

237
00:12:04,490 --> 00:12:06,190
No, not at all. None of the others.

238
00:12:06,250 --> 00:12:07,460
— I'm sure they do!
— For real?

239
00:12:07,520 --> 00:12:09,490
The others don't have anything.
Show us second place!

240
00:12:09,560 --> 00:12:10,660
Show us second place!

241
00:12:10,860 --> 00:12:12,390
What if they do have additional stuff?

242
00:12:14,060 --> 00:12:15,330
Nothing additional.

243
00:12:15,400 --> 00:12:17,270
I told you, didn't I?

244
00:12:17,330 --> 00:12:20,370
So I'm sure first place must be...

245
00:12:20,440 --> 00:12:21,840
I get it.

246
00:12:22,300 --> 00:12:24,810
This isn't like I imagined at all.

247
00:12:24,870 --> 00:12:26,010
It's not fun at all.

248
00:12:26,070 --> 00:12:28,240
Then we should do it like you had in mind.

249
00:12:28,310 --> 00:12:31,710
I tried but you forced me to show you.

250
00:12:31,780 --> 00:12:33,280
Cover them up and let's go again.

251
00:12:33,350 --> 00:12:34,750
Show them to us, cover them.

252
00:12:34,820 --> 00:12:37,420
I had a lot more excitement in mind.

253
00:12:37,890 --> 00:12:39,690
I wanted to do a simulation like that.

254
00:12:39,750 --> 00:12:41,190
We're sorry!

255
00:12:41,260 --> 00:12:42,860
Alright, then!

256
00:12:42,920 --> 00:12:45,130
Having maxed out my Lumine skills...

257
00:12:45,190 --> 00:12:47,860
— This again?
— This goes after that, okay?

258
00:12:48,060 --> 00:12:49,560
Third place is Past Tsutsumishita.

259
00:12:49,630 --> 00:12:53,440
It's a "who goes home first" ranking,
So just get ready, and...

260
00:12:53,500 --> 00:12:54,840
Wait a second, and answer.

261
00:12:54,900 --> 00:12:57,970
I think third place is Past Tsutsumishita.

262
00:12:58,040 --> 00:12:59,740
— So what is it?
— You think so?

263
00:12:59,810 --> 00:13:01,580
— I do.
— Alright, let's take a look.

264
00:13:01,980 --> 00:13:05,280
I'm going to be using Futtonda's system for this. (EN: 5)

265
00:13:05,910 --> 00:13:07,980
I don't really get Futtonda.

266
00:13:08,520 --> 00:13:10,190
Sliding like...

267
00:13:10,250 --> 00:13:11,250
So like a futon?

268
00:13:13,020 --> 00:13:15,020
Correct!

269
00:13:15,390 --> 00:13:16,990
— One point.
— Amazing!

270
00:13:17,060 --> 00:13:18,230
No way, yeah.

271
00:13:18,290 --> 00:13:19,460
Shall we do this?

272
00:13:20,360 --> 00:13:22,160
Second place is...

273
00:13:22,230 --> 00:13:23,700
What do you think?

274
00:13:24,370 --> 00:13:27,140
— Well...
— You want a hint?

275
00:13:27,470 --> 00:13:30,770
No... I think it's Non Style's Inoue.

276
00:13:31,410 --> 00:13:34,040
— That's close!
— I'm wrong?

277
00:13:34,110 --> 00:13:35,610
That's close!

278
00:13:35,680 --> 00:13:39,580
— No way, no way, no way!
— Way, way, way!

279
00:13:42,380 --> 00:13:44,220
That's a shame!

280
00:13:44,290 --> 00:13:45,850
Look, look!
That said Inoue!

281
00:13:45,920 --> 00:13:47,560
— I saw it!
— Inoue Ma!

282
00:13:48,120 --> 00:13:51,190
— No way, no way, no way!
— Way, way, way!

283
00:13:51,260 --> 00:13:53,090
I think I see Inoue. but not the "Ma".

284
00:13:53,160 --> 00:13:54,430
Yeah, you're right.

285
00:13:54,500 --> 00:13:56,330
Ma Inoue isn't written there.

286
00:13:56,400 --> 00:13:58,570
— Is this fun?
— No, Fujimoto-san.

287
00:14:00,640 --> 00:14:02,440
— Is this fun?
— Is this what you wanted to do?

288
00:14:02,500 --> 00:14:05,140
At least let us get to first place!

289
00:14:05,210 --> 00:14:06,680
Please just give us first place.

290
00:14:09,680 --> 00:14:11,050
That's Inoue, of course.

291
00:14:11,110 --> 00:14:13,880
Inoue? What Inoue?

292
00:14:14,120 --> 00:14:16,280
The deputy chief, general manager!
Correct!

293
00:14:16,520 --> 00:14:17,750
Is this meant to be fun?

294
00:14:19,320 --> 00:14:21,260
— Okay, first place.
— Is this meant to be fun?

295
00:14:21,490 --> 00:14:23,460
— Okay, first place.
— I think everyone agrees...

296
00:14:23,760 --> 00:14:26,090
We're all trying to get hyped up for you.

297
00:14:26,160 --> 00:14:28,800
First place, first place.

298
00:14:28,860 --> 00:14:30,130
Someone who goes home like...

299
00:14:30,200 --> 00:14:31,370
We got this far, let's see first place.

300
00:14:31,570 --> 00:14:34,100
I guess first place really is...

301
00:14:34,700 --> 00:14:37,270
So first place goes home for real so...

302
00:14:37,470 --> 00:14:39,170
I guess Haranishi is pretty quick.

303
00:14:39,240 --> 00:14:41,140
He's super quick in going home.

304
00:14:41,210 --> 00:14:42,810
And he doesn't have an excuse?

305
00:14:42,880 --> 00:14:44,610
— None at all.
— There's also Reiji.

306
00:14:44,680 --> 00:14:46,480
He's quick, yeah.

307
00:14:46,550 --> 00:14:48,880
He leaves quick even when working, since he's driving.

308
00:14:48,950 --> 00:14:50,890
— I wonder about that.
— Maeda from Hurricanes?

309
00:14:50,950 --> 00:14:52,750
Who are you trying to hide?

310
00:14:52,820 --> 00:14:55,190
— That was just Reiji-san.
— Why did you do that all of a sudden?

311
00:14:55,260 --> 00:14:57,590
— Reiji-san.
— Reiji-san?

312
00:14:57,660 --> 00:14:58,830
Not Haranishi?

313
00:14:58,890 --> 00:15:01,160
Koba-san said Reiji-san and you started moving that.

314
00:15:01,230 --> 00:15:02,230
Okay, so who is it then?

315
00:15:02,300 --> 00:15:04,770
Which one is Fujimon trying to ignore?
Fujimon is ignoring...

316
00:15:05,400 --> 00:15:06,530
Just figure out which one you're going with.

317
00:15:06,600 --> 00:15:07,840
He was moving it when

318
00:15:07,900 --> 00:15:09,440
he went all "that's close!".

319
00:15:09,500 --> 00:15:10,940
I just wanted to do it when you were close.

320
00:15:11,010 --> 00:15:12,010
You're talking about that movement?

321
00:15:12,070 --> 00:15:13,840
So which one was closer?

322
00:15:14,010 --> 00:15:15,210
Fujimoto-san.

323
00:15:15,480 --> 00:15:16,480
— Huh?
— He was closer.

324
00:15:16,540 --> 00:15:17,550
See? It was Fujimon.

325
00:15:17,610 --> 00:15:19,510
Maybe I was right.

326
00:15:19,580 --> 00:15:20,850
Just say it clearly then.

327
00:15:21,420 --> 00:15:23,020
Haranishi from Fujiwara.

328
00:15:23,250 --> 00:15:24,250
Alright...!

329
00:15:24,320 --> 00:15:28,520
— Way, way, way, way!
— No way, no way, no way!

330
00:15:33,460 --> 00:15:35,530
Correct!

331
00:15:35,600 --> 00:15:37,670
— Got it!
— It's correct!

332
00:15:37,730 --> 00:15:39,630
Congratulations!

333
00:15:39,700 --> 00:15:41,040
Fujimoto-san gets the first place!

334
00:15:41,140 --> 00:15:43,470
Okay, so next question.

335
00:15:43,540 --> 00:15:44,540
That's enough.

336
00:15:44,610 --> 00:15:45,910
— The question is—
— I said enough!

337
00:15:45,970 --> 00:15:47,780
Let's go.

338
00:15:48,310 --> 00:15:51,580
It was incredibly quick.
Especially Haranishi-san.

339
00:15:51,650 --> 00:15:52,650
Haranishio, yeah.

340
00:15:53,150 --> 00:15:55,480
Who's calling him "Haranishio" anyways?

341
00:15:58,390 --> 00:15:59,720
So what's next?

342
00:16:02,120 --> 00:16:05,530
— So Haranishi-san is...
— Now I see a trend.

343
00:16:05,530 --> 00:16:08,500
I guess you could call it a trend.
At least Haranishi-san definitely is one to leave really early.

344
00:16:08,500 --> 00:16:09,500
He is.

345
00:16:09,560 --> 00:16:11,330
So after seeing him,

346
00:16:12,070 --> 00:16:13,370
and how fast he leaves,

347
00:16:13,440 --> 00:16:15,870
Murakami Shouji-san said something in particular.

348
00:16:15,940 --> 00:16:17,840
That's the quiz?!

349
00:16:19,240 --> 00:16:20,340
Tell us already!

350
00:16:20,410 --> 00:16:23,510
We may just be starting, but still tell us everything.

351
00:16:23,810 --> 00:16:26,550
"Is Haranishi there?" or something like that?

352
00:16:26,610 --> 00:16:28,280
— Yeah.
— A single thing?

353
00:16:28,350 --> 00:16:32,020
"So that guy left already?"
What's next? (EN: 6)

354
00:16:32,090 --> 00:16:33,420
He's gone?!

355
00:16:33,520 --> 00:16:34,660
"Haranishi went home already"

356
00:16:34,720 --> 00:16:36,860
"Ben! Ben!" and then.

357
00:16:37,060 --> 00:16:38,990
"Ben! Is Ben there?!"

358
00:16:39,290 --> 00:16:41,160
No one's gonna understand that.

359
00:16:41,360 --> 00:16:42,830
He doesn't call Ben Yamagata like that anyways.

360
00:16:42,900 --> 00:16:44,870
— And his disciple,
— When he's in the unicycle.

361
00:16:45,500 --> 00:16:48,040
Like the comedian that lived in Bangkok.

362
00:16:48,100 --> 00:16:49,540
Right, right.

363
00:16:49,600 --> 00:16:51,340
He doesn't call Ben Yamagata like that.

364
00:16:51,410 --> 00:16:53,010
— They're wings.
— You can't understand that!

365
00:16:53,070 --> 00:16:55,240
— Ben!
— Ben is right here.

366
00:16:55,310 --> 00:16:56,610
— He's not here anymore.
— Ben's not here.

367
00:16:56,680 --> 00:16:59,610
He's not here?
Is Ben here, though?

368
00:16:59,810 --> 00:17:03,150
"He's not here?
Is Ben here, though?"

369
00:17:03,200 --> 00:17:05,820
No, I think it goes more like "He's this and that, after all".

370
00:17:05,820 --> 00:17:07,820
— Sort of like a metaphor, right?
— He says that a lot.

371
00:17:07,890 --> 00:17:09,090
That's a good one. Ready?

372
00:17:09,160 --> 00:17:10,790
Yeah, pretty much.

373
00:17:11,160 --> 00:17:13,360
Are we going to understand the metaphor though?

374
00:17:13,560 --> 00:17:16,130
Well, let's see.
We probably understand it,

375
00:17:16,200 --> 00:17:18,600
but I think it's geared towards older folks.

376
00:17:18,670 --> 00:17:20,140
So it's something older people would come up with.

377
00:17:20,200 --> 00:17:22,070
He's a jet...
A jumbo jet?

378
00:17:22,140 --> 00:17:24,310
He's just like a falcon?

379
00:17:24,740 --> 00:17:26,210
— He's just like Carl Lewis!
— No.

380
00:17:26,270 --> 00:17:30,010
An NSR with a limiter cut on its chamber?

381
00:17:30,710 --> 00:17:31,710
Say what?

382
00:17:31,780 --> 00:17:34,550
Or an RZ350 with Nanahan Hunter.

383
00:17:34,620 --> 00:17:36,890
Shouji-san would never say anything like that.

384
00:17:37,150 --> 00:17:39,820
By the way, I'll give you another hint.

385
00:17:40,690 --> 00:17:42,760
It's not about speed.

386
00:17:42,990 --> 00:17:44,090
— Got it.
— It's about disappearing.

387
00:17:44,160 --> 00:17:45,760
Vanishing?

388
00:17:45,830 --> 00:17:47,000
That's good, that's good!

389
00:17:47,060 --> 00:17:49,830
Kobayashi-san.
Fujimoto-san. Got it?

390
00:17:49,900 --> 00:17:51,030
He's vanishing.

391
00:17:51,100 --> 00:17:52,800
Is he Wakaooji-san?

392
00:17:53,130 --> 00:17:54,140
He just vanished.

393
00:17:54,200 --> 00:17:57,870
That's Wakaooji-san from Mitsubishi.
His finger looks like this.

394
00:17:57,940 --> 00:18:01,510
But in Manila in the Philippines, it turned out he had it all along.

395
00:18:01,580 --> 00:18:04,610
Okay, okay, okay, okay!
It's time?!

396
00:18:04,680 --> 00:18:06,010
— It's not time.
— Something about a chameleon?

397
00:18:06,080 --> 00:18:07,520
Since they disappear.

398
00:18:07,580 --> 00:18:10,520
That has to be it! There's nothing else.

399
00:18:10,590 --> 00:18:12,090
It's just not there...

400
00:18:12,150 --> 00:18:14,120
That's the only possible answer.

401
00:18:14,190 --> 00:18:16,490
Alright, let's do another round.

402
00:18:18,530 --> 00:18:20,030
Two more tries then.

403
00:18:20,090 --> 00:18:21,300
Aren't you too hopeless already?

404
00:18:21,360 --> 00:18:23,030
I don't know anymore.

405
00:18:23,100 --> 00:18:24,200
Something with Kamaitachi?

406
00:18:24,470 --> 00:18:26,430
— That's enough.
— Yeah, that's enough.

407
00:18:26,500 --> 00:18:28,270
Something about a phoenix?

408
00:18:28,440 --> 00:18:29,900
— No.
— Tezuka Osamu?

409
00:18:29,970 --> 00:18:31,010
Tezuka Osamu?

410
00:18:31,070 --> 00:18:32,770
Fujimoto-san already said two.

411
00:18:32,840 --> 00:18:34,040
One more.

412
00:18:34,110 --> 00:18:35,910
— Something about Nessie?
— No.

413
00:18:35,980 --> 00:18:38,110
— The Tsuchinoko?
— Not the Tsuchinoko either.

414
00:18:38,180 --> 00:18:40,480
Maybe it wasn't Haranishi to begin with.

415
00:18:40,550 --> 00:18:42,520
No, that's not it. You used your second one.

416
00:18:42,580 --> 00:18:44,920
— Bigfoot?
— A unicorn?

417
00:18:44,990 --> 00:18:47,660
Not a unicorn or bigfoot. One more.

418
00:18:47,720 --> 00:18:49,160
That's all I have.

419
00:18:49,220 --> 00:18:50,830
A giraffe written with its difficult kanji?

420
00:18:50,890 --> 00:18:53,090
— It's over, it's over.
— We all said two options.

421
00:18:53,160 --> 00:18:54,360
We all said two options.

422
00:18:54,600 --> 00:18:56,330
I'll show you the correct one.

423
00:18:56,970 --> 00:19:01,900
He's gone?
He's just like a dying cat.

424
00:19:09,980 --> 00:19:13,410
No one thought about it even for a second?

425
00:19:13,480 --> 00:19:14,580
Shouji-san...

426
00:19:14,650 --> 00:19:16,150
That's just...

427
00:19:16,220 --> 00:19:18,150
Alright, one more.

428
00:19:18,220 --> 00:19:20,090
That's enough. Enough already!

429
00:19:20,150 --> 00:19:22,120
— Yeah, that's fine.
— Please make one more.

430
00:19:22,190 --> 00:19:24,090
Stop it, you liar!

431
00:19:24,160 --> 00:19:25,360
— Please one more.
— That's enough.

432
00:19:25,430 --> 00:19:27,000
We haven't even tried for a hundredth time.

433
00:19:27,460 --> 00:19:28,630
That's enough!

434
00:19:28,700 --> 00:19:29,900
Want to play Karuta?

435
00:19:29,960 --> 00:19:32,700
Come on, I have a game, too.

436
00:19:32,770 --> 00:19:34,300
— Want to play?
— Sure.

437
00:19:34,370 --> 00:19:36,170
Let's do it.
Though it's an easy game.

438
00:19:36,500 --> 00:19:37,610
I'm getting kinda hungry.

439
00:19:37,670 --> 00:19:38,670
Yeah, me too.

440
00:19:38,740 --> 00:19:40,480
Wanna eat some ramen?

441
00:19:40,540 --> 00:19:43,080
I want to order something.

442
00:19:43,140 --> 00:19:44,750
Let's order some sushi.

443
00:19:44,810 --> 00:19:46,310
— Not sushi.
— Why?

444
00:19:46,380 --> 00:19:47,820
We have Getty!

445
00:19:47,880 --> 00:19:49,680
Let's get a pizza for everyone.

446
00:19:50,120 --> 00:19:52,020
A pizza, huh?

447
00:19:52,590 --> 00:19:54,220
You know how to play the Harmonica?

448
00:19:54,290 --> 00:19:57,330
You put it here over your folk guitar, right?

449
00:19:57,390 --> 00:20:00,930
You put the harmonica in your mouth and we'll hit you.

450
00:20:01,000 --> 00:20:02,000
That's too much.

451
00:20:02,060 --> 00:20:03,500
You lose if it makes a sound.

452
00:20:04,100 --> 00:20:05,330
It's going to make a sound for sure.

453
00:20:05,400 --> 00:20:06,400
What are we going to hit them with?

454
00:20:06,470 --> 00:20:07,570
Anything's fine, really.

455
00:20:07,640 --> 00:20:10,000
You have some wood logs?

456
00:20:11,670 --> 00:20:13,140
Who's the strongest?

457
00:20:13,340 --> 00:20:15,210
— This is good!
— It's gonna hurt.

458
00:20:15,440 --> 00:20:16,510
What are you going to do?

459
00:20:16,580 --> 00:20:17,780
With this?

460
00:20:17,850 --> 00:20:19,050
This is bad!

461
00:20:19,110 --> 00:20:21,250
That's definitely gonna hurt!

462
00:20:21,650 --> 00:20:23,320
And yet you're going first?

463
00:20:23,380 --> 00:20:25,020
— Why me?
— It's just fair!

464
00:20:25,290 --> 00:20:26,650
As a sample!

465
00:20:26,720 --> 00:20:29,960
Okay, get the chair ready.
I'm gonna do it.

466
00:20:30,020 --> 00:20:31,630
Are we all going to do it?

467
00:20:31,860 --> 00:20:34,460
Just wipe it with the sanitizer!

468
00:20:34,530 --> 00:20:35,930
Can you stop it, Fujimon?

469
00:20:36,000 --> 00:20:38,200
Why?

470
00:20:38,270 --> 00:20:39,630
Because Fujimon is always the most...

471
00:20:40,270 --> 00:20:42,200
This is kinda nasty.

472
00:20:43,170 --> 00:20:44,410
He's the cleanest.

473
00:20:45,010 --> 00:20:46,670
I'm the cleanest.

474
00:20:47,040 --> 00:20:48,410
Not really.

475
00:20:49,340 --> 00:20:50,380
Just wipe it.

476
00:20:51,710 --> 00:20:53,250
Anyone has a tissue?
A wet tissue?

477
00:20:53,310 --> 00:20:54,520
I can get one.

478
00:20:54,580 --> 00:20:55,980
I hate this.

479
00:20:56,180 --> 00:20:58,390
He's a beauty.

480
00:20:58,450 --> 00:21:03,020
He just smells so good.

481
00:21:03,090 --> 00:21:04,690
Ah, you noticed earlier when you kissed?

482
00:21:04,760 --> 00:21:06,260
Let's do this, let's do this.

483
00:21:06,890 --> 00:21:07,930
— For real.

484
00:21:08,000 --> 00:21:09,160
Okay, Seiji.

485
00:21:09,230 --> 00:21:11,100
And he's so damned soft.

486
00:21:11,170 --> 00:21:12,500
— Damned virgin.
— For real.

487
00:21:12,730 --> 00:21:14,670
— What are you doing?

488
00:21:14,970 --> 00:21:16,370
Drop it, man!

489
00:21:16,440 --> 00:21:18,170
So who's going to do it?

490
00:21:18,370 --> 00:21:20,070
— I'll do it.
— No, no, no...

491
00:21:20,140 --> 00:21:21,940
Are you hitting...?

492
00:21:22,010 --> 00:21:23,910
Just how bad are you going to do it?

493
00:21:23,980 --> 00:21:25,350
I just need you to remember the rules.

494
00:21:25,410 --> 00:21:26,880
I'm going to do it like this.

495
00:21:26,950 --> 00:21:29,580
Isn't that too much?

496
00:21:29,650 --> 00:21:30,650
That hurts.

497
00:21:31,650 --> 00:21:33,350
That's gonna hurt a lot.

498
00:21:33,790 --> 00:21:35,020
So he can't match the sound?

499
00:21:35,090 --> 00:21:37,490
— No, no, he can't make any sound.
— If he does, he loses.

500
00:21:37,690 --> 00:21:40,030
So put this in his mouth.

501
00:21:40,900 --> 00:21:42,000
— He's pale!

502
00:21:42,060 --> 00:21:44,600
Too pale!

503
00:21:44,670 --> 00:21:45,700
Pretty neat.

504
00:21:45,770 --> 00:21:46,800
Let's go!

505
00:21:47,370 --> 00:21:48,670
No, this is gonna hurt!

506
00:21:49,070 --> 00:21:50,200
Do it around here.

507
00:21:50,270 --> 00:21:51,270
That's gonna hurt for sure.

508
00:21:51,340 --> 00:21:53,370
Just let me... think this through.

509
00:21:53,440 --> 00:21:55,440
In your mouth, in your mouth.

510
00:21:55,510 --> 00:21:56,940
And hands behind your back.

511
00:21:57,010 --> 00:21:58,010
So that's how it is?

512
00:21:58,080 --> 00:21:59,310
That's how it is?

513
00:21:59,380 --> 00:22:01,280
— I can't drop it either?
— Feeling the pressure?

514
00:22:01,350 --> 00:22:02,920
Let's do this.

515
00:22:02,980 --> 00:22:04,250
No, no, come on.

516
00:22:04,320 --> 00:22:05,320
This is torture.

517
00:22:05,390 --> 00:22:07,090
Let's go.

518
00:22:09,090 --> 00:22:10,860
— He held it.
— Too soft.

519
00:22:10,930 --> 00:22:11,930
Do it a little more.

520
00:22:11,990 --> 00:22:13,030
No, no, no, no.

521
00:22:14,160 --> 00:22:15,400
Are you stupid?

522
00:22:15,460 --> 00:22:17,300
If you do that I'm going to make a sound of course!

523
00:22:18,000 --> 00:22:19,000
Sorry.

524
00:22:20,170 --> 00:22:21,540
That looked like it hurt.

525
00:22:22,470 --> 00:22:24,310
Ouch.

526
00:22:24,510 --> 00:22:25,970
Sorry, I missed.

527
00:22:26,040 --> 00:22:28,540
He didn't have it in his mouth?
Sorry.

528
00:22:30,080 --> 00:22:31,380
Seiji, are you going to put it in your mouth?

529
00:22:31,450 --> 00:22:33,250
It's not fun otherwise.

530
00:22:33,480 --> 00:22:34,480
Sorry.

531
00:22:34,550 --> 00:22:36,320
I think we have to look at an example.

532
00:22:36,380 --> 00:22:37,990
— I don't get it.
— Let's do it once.

533
00:22:38,050 --> 00:22:40,420
The inventor!

534
00:22:40,490 --> 00:22:41,790
Let's do this for once!

535
00:22:41,860 --> 00:22:43,120
Okay, wait.

536
00:22:43,190 --> 00:22:44,460
You can't do it no matter what.

537
00:22:44,530 --> 00:22:46,330
No matter how many times.

538
00:22:46,790 --> 00:22:48,100
Do it with strength, for real.

539
00:22:48,160 --> 00:22:50,670
Kind of the same as with Seiji earlier?

540
00:22:50,730 --> 00:22:51,800
That's pretty bad.

541
00:22:52,300 --> 00:22:53,900
Of course, like my second time.

542
00:22:53,970 --> 00:22:55,040
Yeah, like the second time.

543
00:22:56,140 --> 00:22:58,610
Wait a second.
Around here.

544
00:23:02,310 --> 00:23:03,310
Here I go.

545
00:23:09,520 --> 00:23:11,290
— I heard that.
— For sure.

546
00:23:14,120 --> 00:23:15,760
— He's not holding it.
— He's making a lot of noise.

547
00:23:15,820 --> 00:23:18,060
— A lot.
— The second time is impossible.

548
00:23:18,730 --> 00:23:20,360
You were doing it since the first time, though.

549
00:23:20,700 --> 00:23:22,330
You made a sound.

550
00:23:23,000 --> 00:23:25,030
I feel like Seiji might've smiled.

551
00:23:25,100 --> 00:23:26,870
Come on, Seiji.

552
00:23:30,000 --> 00:23:31,640
— That looked painful.
— It hurt like hell.

553
00:23:31,710 --> 00:23:33,070
It hurts like shit.

554
00:23:33,310 --> 00:23:35,010
Why don't we do that?

555
00:23:35,080 --> 00:23:37,480
Let's do rock, paper, scissors, and decide the order

556
00:23:37,550 --> 00:23:39,650
from the winner to the loser.

557
00:23:39,710 --> 00:23:41,450
Ah, I get it.

558
00:23:41,520 --> 00:23:44,350
We're the last ones anyways, right?

559
00:23:44,420 --> 00:23:46,050
Okay, wait, wait a second.

560
00:23:52,790 --> 00:23:55,660
Okay. I have a suggestion.

561
00:23:55,730 --> 00:23:58,070
If someone manages to hold it in,

562
00:23:58,130 --> 00:23:59,800
they get to hit the next one.

563
00:23:59,870 --> 00:24:00,870
Switching it up.

564
00:24:00,940 --> 00:24:02,770
That's pretty great.

565
00:24:02,840 --> 00:24:05,270
So the one getting hit now hits the next one?

566
00:24:05,340 --> 00:24:07,280
— We'd be switching.
— If they hold it in,

567
00:24:07,340 --> 00:24:08,810
they can do it.

568
00:24:08,880 --> 00:24:10,440
This is fucking endless then.

569
00:24:15,050 --> 00:24:16,320
Don't hold back.

570
00:24:20,390 --> 00:24:22,020
You're smiling, aren't you?
You're smiling?

571
00:24:24,390 --> 00:24:26,630
He was smiling.

572
00:24:27,460 --> 00:24:28,660
You were smiling for sure, man.

573
00:24:28,730 --> 00:24:30,200
He was really smiling!

574
00:24:31,030 --> 00:24:33,570
That's when you laugh?!

575
00:24:33,630 --> 00:24:34,770
He was smiling a lot!

576
00:24:34,840 --> 00:24:36,070
He was smiling all along!

577
00:24:36,140 --> 00:24:37,770
That's how you can tell a sadist apart.

578
00:24:37,970 --> 00:24:39,770
What's going on?

579
00:24:40,170 --> 00:24:42,210
You'd been doing it for a while!

580
00:24:43,180 --> 00:24:44,710
You had a little too much fun?

581
00:24:46,080 --> 00:24:47,080
He was smiling a lot, right?

582
00:24:47,150 --> 00:24:48,880
He was definitely smiling!

583
00:24:49,280 --> 00:24:52,350
He was happy to be getting good at this.

584
00:24:52,420 --> 00:24:53,420
He was basically just doing his job.

585
00:24:53,490 --> 00:24:54,490
Besides, you were almost grinning

586
00:24:54,560 --> 00:24:56,120
all the time while doing it!

587
00:24:56,320 --> 00:24:57,560
He was grinning for sure!

588
00:24:57,630 --> 00:24:58,830
He totally forgot!

589
00:24:58,890 --> 00:25:01,500
I'm sorry! I was just enjoying the game.

590
00:25:01,730 --> 00:25:03,760
— I'm sorry.
— Also, Seiji!

591
00:25:03,830 --> 00:25:05,570
You were almost smiling all along!

592
00:25:07,170 --> 00:25:09,240
I was just waiting for you to show up.

593
00:25:09,300 --> 00:25:10,770
That's right, that's right.

594
00:25:10,840 --> 00:25:12,370
But we didn't get to the actual strike.

595
00:25:12,440 --> 00:25:15,380
It's been a general problem for a while already.

596
00:25:15,440 --> 00:25:17,110
We were just having a lot of fun!

597
00:25:17,180 --> 00:25:18,550
That's no good, though.

598
00:25:18,610 --> 00:25:21,120
You can have fun, but the challenge is to not smile.

599
00:25:21,450 --> 00:25:23,120
I've got an orange already, so I'm in trouble.

600
00:25:23,180 --> 00:25:26,620
I knew I was in trouble and had to hold it in for real.

601
00:25:26,690 --> 00:25:28,760
Let's take a look at Coo-chan, then.
I'm sorry!

602
00:25:29,890 --> 00:25:31,190
Don't hold back.

603
00:25:31,390 --> 00:25:33,360
He's smiling already!

604
00:25:33,430 --> 00:25:35,230
He's definitely smiling already.

605
00:25:35,300 --> 00:25:37,530
He's totally smiling, right?

606
00:25:39,730 --> 00:25:42,470
I get the feeling that it was around that moment.

607
00:25:42,770 --> 00:25:43,970
It's not quite grinning, though.

608
00:25:44,040 --> 00:25:45,740
But he admits it himself anyways.

609
00:25:45,810 --> 00:25:47,880
So that's all there is to it.

610
00:25:47,940 --> 00:25:49,110
Also, Seiji.

611
00:25:49,180 --> 00:25:53,410
Seiji didn't quite smile, but still...

612
00:25:56,380 --> 00:25:57,490
He's smiling?

613
00:25:57,690 --> 00:25:58,720
He's not smiling.

614
00:25:58,790 --> 00:25:59,820
He kind of is a little.

615
00:25:59,890 --> 00:26:01,360
He's grinning.

616
00:26:01,560 --> 00:26:03,590
He's smiling!

617
00:26:03,860 --> 00:26:06,490
You did that all the time!

618
00:26:06,560 --> 00:26:07,800
That was a smile!

619
00:26:07,860 --> 00:26:10,200
And it wasn't just once!

620
00:26:10,260 --> 00:26:11,270
Come on, Seiji.

621
00:26:11,330 --> 00:26:16,100
All the way from Sri Lanka!

622
00:26:16,540 --> 00:26:19,170
Long Sri Lanka!

623
00:26:19,240 --> 00:26:22,440
To be honest, right now we're over three and a half hours.

624
00:26:22,640 --> 00:26:25,110
So he has been like that for almost three full hours.

625
00:26:26,310 --> 00:26:29,450
Well, alright, first...
Your first one.

626
00:26:29,520 --> 00:26:30,520
Thank you very much.

627
00:26:30,580 --> 00:26:31,750
That's his first?

628
00:26:31,990 --> 00:26:33,750
We have to take him down gradually.

629
00:26:33,820 --> 00:26:36,060
We have to do it gradually somehow.

630
00:26:36,120 --> 00:26:38,030
And also, Seiji.
You're out!

631
00:26:38,090 --> 00:26:39,930
The Chihara brothers!

632
00:26:39,990 --> 00:26:41,000
I see!
For real!

633
00:26:41,060 --> 00:26:42,130
Come back as a zombie!

634
00:26:47,600 --> 00:26:49,170
I want Fujita out already.

635
00:26:49,240 --> 00:26:50,570
Why me?!

636
00:26:50,640 --> 00:26:52,770
Well, it's just that...

637
00:26:52,840 --> 00:26:53,980
I just want him out already.

638
00:26:54,040 --> 00:26:57,140
Fujita is... Fujita you're...

639
00:26:57,210 --> 00:26:58,850
You're not funny at all, so keep trying.

640
00:27:00,750 --> 00:27:02,380
That stings, you know?

641
00:27:02,450 --> 00:27:04,790
No, no, you're funny week to week.

642
00:27:04,850 --> 00:27:06,990
You're killing me here.

643
00:27:07,660 --> 00:27:08,720
Don't puke so quietly.

644
00:27:08,790 --> 00:27:10,360
But I'm really trying here.

645
00:27:10,420 --> 00:27:12,190
— Leave the stage!
— Leave!

646
00:27:12,260 --> 00:27:13,890
You don't belong here!

647
00:27:14,330 --> 00:27:16,260
With this, the Chihara brothers are out!

648
00:27:16,330 --> 00:27:17,530
That's right!

649
00:27:17,600 --> 00:27:20,070
But the Chihara brothers might come back as zombies!

650
00:27:20,130 --> 00:27:21,140
That's right!

651
00:27:21,200 --> 00:27:22,570
What will be the joke?

652
00:27:24,840 --> 00:27:27,340
They told me not to smile all the time.

653
00:27:27,680 --> 00:27:29,110
They sure did.

654
00:27:29,740 --> 00:27:34,180
To be honest, I think I might've been smiling a lot.

655
00:27:36,550 --> 00:27:38,520
This is an important time in my life,

656
00:27:38,590 --> 00:27:40,890
so don't speak in languages I can't understand!

657
00:27:40,960 --> 00:27:42,260
We're sorry.

658
00:27:43,390 --> 00:27:45,490
You don't get it!
Seiji, Seiji, Seiji!

659
00:27:45,690 --> 00:27:47,430
Seiji is definitely smiling, though!

660
00:27:53,200 --> 00:27:54,370
Are you gonna keep going?!

661
00:27:54,970 --> 00:27:56,970
Not yet, man!

662
00:27:58,940 --> 00:28:02,110
He's having the best time of his life.

663
00:28:02,180 --> 00:28:03,440
I just have to hold it in.

664
00:28:03,600 --> 00:28:05,080
— You can barely do that though.
— Barely, yeah.

665
00:28:05,080 --> 00:28:06,180
But I love this.

666
00:28:06,250 --> 00:28:07,250
Here we go.

667
00:28:07,580 --> 00:28:09,780
It started.

668
00:28:10,680 --> 00:28:12,120
— So?
— Are we gonna keep going?

669
00:28:12,390 --> 00:28:13,720
The harmonica, the harmonica.

670
00:28:14,060 --> 00:28:15,060
In your mouth.

671
00:28:15,690 --> 00:28:17,160
Do it for real this time.

672
00:28:18,290 --> 00:28:19,960
I don't think I could hold it.

673
00:28:20,030 --> 00:28:21,030
You're awesome, Koba!

674
00:28:21,830 --> 00:28:22,830
Because it hurts, right Koba?

675
00:28:22,900 --> 00:28:24,300
It takes some training.

676
00:28:25,230 --> 00:28:26,630
You played rugby, right Koba-san?

677
00:28:26,700 --> 00:28:28,770
We loved this shit back in rugby, yeah.

678
00:28:35,240 --> 00:28:36,240
Let's go.

679
00:28:42,420 --> 00:28:44,020
That looks painful as shit.

680
00:28:45,450 --> 00:28:46,890
How was that?
How was that just now?

681
00:28:46,950 --> 00:28:48,560
— That was a sound.
— No way.

682
00:28:48,620 --> 00:28:49,920
That was a sound, yeah, it was.

683
00:28:50,320 --> 00:28:52,330
Okay, next one please.

684
00:28:52,390 --> 00:28:53,390
Koba-san.

685
00:28:53,460 --> 00:28:55,060
— Give me a tissue.
— Wipe it, wipe it.

686
00:28:55,900 --> 00:28:58,170
I'm surprisingly fine with this.

687
00:28:59,230 --> 00:29:02,640
Kobayashi-san, you're a pretty tough guy, right?

688
00:29:02,700 --> 00:29:04,440
He's not gonna tell you to go full strength, though.

689
00:29:04,510 --> 00:29:05,540
But still,

690
00:29:05,610 --> 00:29:08,010
Koba-san has taken good care of me for so long.

691
00:29:08,080 --> 00:29:09,380
I'm really sorry, Koba-san.

692
00:29:09,440 --> 00:29:11,510
But I don't want to be too lax with this.

693
00:29:12,450 --> 00:29:14,010
Ready? Here I go.

694
00:29:20,290 --> 00:29:21,290
He's super weak.

695
00:29:21,360 --> 00:29:22,760
He's making a lot of noise.

696
00:29:23,490 --> 00:29:26,560
What do you say, Kawamoto?

697
00:29:32,200 --> 00:29:33,200
No, no.

698
00:29:34,840 --> 00:29:36,670
That's definitely a lot of noise.

699
00:29:37,300 --> 00:29:38,370
You lose, man.

700
00:29:38,770 --> 00:29:40,010
That one?!
No, no, no.

701
00:29:40,070 --> 00:29:41,410
Can you hold it?

702
00:29:41,480 --> 00:29:42,710
So this means that leg's stronger?

703
00:29:42,780 --> 00:29:44,110
That doesn't make any sense.

704
00:29:44,180 --> 00:29:45,380
I'm right legged, after all.

705
00:29:45,450 --> 00:29:46,450
I see.

706
00:29:46,450 --> 00:29:49,120
I used to do this with my left leg all the time while practicing.
With beer bottles and stuff.

707
00:29:49,120 --> 00:29:50,350
I get it, I get it, I get it.

708
00:29:50,420 --> 00:29:51,720
With beer bottles?!

709
00:29:52,850 --> 00:29:54,760
That's pretty badass.

710
00:29:54,990 --> 00:29:56,260
Here we go.

711
00:30:05,730 --> 00:30:06,730
Sorry.

712
00:30:07,030 --> 00:30:08,240
You're awful!

713
00:30:08,470 --> 00:30:09,540
"Sorry"?!

714
00:30:16,080 --> 00:30:17,210
Time to change.

715
00:30:17,410 --> 00:30:19,210
— That was the loudest so far.
— He's the weakest.

716
00:30:19,280 --> 00:30:20,810
And it was high pitched and everything.

717
00:30:20,880 --> 00:30:23,050
Why are we hitting Oguchi?

718
00:30:25,550 --> 00:30:26,620
I'm sure Shoji's pretty strong.

719
00:30:26,690 --> 00:30:28,190
He does work out.

720
00:30:28,620 --> 00:30:30,520
This is the worst.

721
00:30:30,590 --> 00:30:32,190
You have to do it around here.

722
00:30:32,260 --> 00:30:33,630
This is pretty bad.

723
00:30:35,500 --> 00:30:37,970
That has to hurt!

724
00:30:38,030 --> 00:30:40,030
Karate students used to do it like this.

725
00:30:40,700 --> 00:30:42,040
— That's how they trained.
— Right.

726
00:30:42,600 --> 00:30:44,210
That hurts!

727
00:30:44,270 --> 00:30:45,270
That really hurts!

728
00:30:45,940 --> 00:30:47,810
Why are we changing the conditions?

729
00:30:47,880 --> 00:30:49,740
That hurts!

730
00:30:49,980 --> 00:30:51,310
That's pretty painful.

731
00:30:51,380 --> 00:30:52,810
It hurts like hell, huh?

732
00:30:59,700 --> 00:31:00,500
You laughed!

733
00:31:05,860 --> 00:31:07,660
You even took your time to fall!

734
00:31:08,760 --> 00:31:09,960
It hurt too much!

735
00:31:10,030 --> 00:31:11,370
Of course it hurts!

736
00:31:11,600 --> 00:31:15,100
I wanted to do it at least once.
It hurts too much!

737
00:31:15,770 --> 00:31:16,770
You stopped it once, though!

738
00:31:16,840 --> 00:31:21,010
For real! I thought I broke my foot!

739
00:31:21,080 --> 00:31:22,140
What's going on?

740
00:31:22,210 --> 00:31:23,480
He said he wanted to stop the recording at least once!

741
00:31:23,540 --> 00:31:24,850
I'm at my limit.

742
00:31:25,910 --> 00:31:27,450
— I see.
— It hurts!

743
00:31:27,510 --> 00:31:30,620
You laughed like an old lady.

744
00:31:30,680 --> 00:31:32,850
He took his sweet time!

745
00:31:32,920 --> 00:31:36,090
I was at my limit.
I had to make some noise at least.

746
00:31:37,930 --> 00:31:40,490
Well, sometimes you do laugh because it hurts too much.

747
00:31:40,560 --> 00:31:42,900
That was a laughter I hadn't heard before.

748
00:31:44,030 --> 00:31:46,330
That was a painful laughter.

749
00:31:47,070 --> 00:31:48,540
It hurts like hell, huh?

750
00:31:48,600 --> 00:31:49,800
I was at my limit.

751
00:31:58,480 --> 00:32:00,710
What was that?! Tried to escape?

752
00:32:00,780 --> 00:32:02,850
That was a desperate laugh.

753
00:32:02,920 --> 00:32:04,080
The bottle really hurts.

754
00:32:04,150 --> 00:32:05,620
It hurts like hell.

755
00:32:05,690 --> 00:32:07,550
Sorry about that.
I did the bottle myself.

756
00:32:07,620 --> 00:32:09,260
Okay, Kawamoto gets...

757
00:32:09,660 --> 00:32:11,590
...an orange!

758
00:32:12,930 --> 00:32:14,660
And also...

759
00:32:14,730 --> 00:32:15,830
Fujita, you're out!

760
00:32:15,900 --> 00:32:17,160
Huh?! Why?!

761
00:32:18,070 --> 00:32:20,270
— Right?
— I wasn't laughing!

762
00:32:20,730 --> 00:32:23,400
— There's no way I'm out!
— Why?

763
00:32:23,470 --> 00:32:25,710
I've never heard of someone being out for being boring!

764
00:32:30,880 --> 00:32:33,580
I think I even got a point for myself.

765
00:32:33,780 --> 00:32:34,850
Me too, probably.

766
00:32:34,920 --> 00:32:35,950
— Really?
— Yeah.

767
00:32:36,550 --> 00:32:38,190
So uh, Koba-san.

768
00:32:38,250 --> 00:32:39,990
What now?

769
00:32:40,050 --> 00:32:41,290
Wanna eat pizza?

770
00:32:41,360 --> 00:32:42,360
We could order sushi as well.

771
00:32:42,420 --> 00:32:43,460
Sushi and pizza?

772
00:32:43,520 --> 00:32:44,560
Sushi and pizza sounds good.

773
00:32:44,630 --> 00:32:46,290
I want to eat sushi and pizza.

774
00:32:46,490 --> 00:32:48,560
Also, I kind of...

775
00:32:49,000 --> 00:32:50,600
I'd like to try out some physical gag.

776
00:32:50,660 --> 00:32:52,470
Yeah, later.

777
00:32:52,700 --> 00:32:54,270
Thanks for calling.

778
00:32:54,340 --> 00:32:56,670
I'm Ota from Ariake Pizzeria.

779
00:32:56,740 --> 00:33:00,040
Excuse me, I'd like to make an order.

780
00:33:00,110 --> 00:33:01,210
Understood. Thank you very much.

781
00:33:01,640 --> 00:33:03,740
Can you please tell me your phone number?

782
00:33:03,910 --> 00:33:06,550
The phone number?

783
00:33:06,610 --> 00:33:09,480
— Yes?
— The phone number...

784
00:33:10,750 --> 00:33:12,150
Uh...

785
00:33:13,320 --> 00:33:15,190
The phone number...

786
00:33:15,260 --> 00:33:17,560
Should I just go with my personal one?

787
00:33:17,620 --> 00:33:18,990
080...

788
00:33:20,460 --> 00:33:22,100
Is he stupid?

789
00:33:23,130 --> 00:33:25,230
Can you tell me your name as well?

790
00:33:25,300 --> 00:33:27,170
— My name?
— Yes.

791
00:33:27,470 --> 00:33:30,100
— Let's go with Fujita.
— Fujita-sama, right?

792
00:33:30,170 --> 00:33:31,740
So now I have to go no matter what.

793
00:33:31,810 --> 00:33:33,470
To receive it.

794
00:33:34,580 --> 00:33:35,640
So what's your order?

795
00:33:35,640 --> 00:33:37,240
But it seems like Amazon is going to broadcast this as well.

796
00:33:37,240 --> 00:33:39,150
You're kidding me?!
They can't do that!!

797
00:33:41,950 --> 00:33:43,650
Uh, I'm sorry.

798
00:33:44,050 --> 00:33:44,250
— I'd like a crab quarter,

799
00:33:44,250 --> 00:33:45,590
— This guy's an idiot.
— I'd like a crab quarter,

800
00:33:45,590 --> 00:33:46,720
— This guy's an idiot.

801
00:33:47,760 --> 00:33:49,620
Rock, paper, scissors!

802
00:33:49,690 --> 00:33:50,760
See? He's not looking.

803
00:33:51,860 --> 00:33:53,960
Get it?

804
00:33:54,030 --> 00:33:56,130
Momentarily, yeah.

805
00:33:57,030 --> 00:33:58,430
Rock, paper, scissors!

806
00:33:58,500 --> 00:34:00,130
I have scissors.

807
00:34:00,200 --> 00:34:02,240
You can't do anything against the powerful double scissors.

808
00:34:02,300 --> 00:34:04,270
What kind of dough do we want?

809
00:34:04,340 --> 00:34:05,340
Dough...

810
00:34:05,710 --> 00:34:07,270
Let's go with an Italian super crispy,

811
00:34:07,340 --> 00:34:08,910
and a hand toss.

812
00:34:08,980 --> 00:34:10,840
With a hand toss.

813
00:34:10,910 --> 00:34:13,250
Rock, paper, scissors!

814
00:34:13,950 --> 00:34:15,380
Why did you withdraw?

815
00:34:15,450 --> 00:34:16,620
He with—

816
00:34:19,090 --> 00:34:20,090
He has been smiling the whole time.

817
00:34:20,150 --> 00:34:21,520
He has, yeah.

818
00:34:21,590 --> 00:34:22,190
— Right now.
— Have fun with the game.

819
00:34:22,190 --> 00:34:23,720
— Anything else?
— Right now.
— Have fun with the game.

820
00:34:23,790 --> 00:34:24,430
— Excuse me for a second.

821
00:34:24,430 --> 00:34:25,030
— Rock, paper, scissors!
— Excuse me for a second.

822
00:34:25,030 --> 00:34:25,290
— Rock, paper, scissors!

823
00:34:25,290 --> 00:34:26,730
What pasta do you want?
Rock, paper, scissors!

824
00:34:27,390 --> 00:34:29,330
Rock, paper, scissors!

825
00:34:29,400 --> 00:34:31,670
Rock, paper, scissors!

826
00:34:32,530 --> 00:34:34,230
He's good!

827
00:34:34,440 --> 00:34:36,440
Rock, paper, scissors!

828
00:34:36,500 --> 00:34:38,370
Rock, paper, scissors!

829
00:34:38,440 --> 00:34:40,440
Rock, paper, scissors!

830
00:34:40,510 --> 00:34:41,580
Rock, paper—

831
00:34:44,680 --> 00:34:45,680
What?

832
00:34:46,280 --> 00:34:47,880
What happened?

833
00:34:47,950 --> 00:34:50,180
He laughed just like that.

834
00:34:52,650 --> 00:34:54,520
What the hell happened?

835
00:34:54,590 --> 00:34:55,590
What was it?

836
00:34:55,660 --> 00:34:57,290
I didn't find out about anything.

837
00:34:59,290 --> 00:35:01,230
Cookie laughed?

838
00:35:01,300 --> 00:35:02,530
That's good!

839
00:35:02,600 --> 00:35:04,470
We have to keep going!

840
00:35:04,770 --> 00:35:06,600
Cookie has moments like this a lot!

841
00:35:06,670 --> 00:35:08,000
He does!

842
00:35:09,240 --> 00:35:13,770
He laughs in the weirdest moments.

843
00:35:13,840 --> 00:35:15,710
More like he's having fun.

844
00:35:17,710 --> 00:35:20,880
And then there was also Kawamoto
while playing rock, paper, scissors.

845
00:35:20,950 --> 00:35:21,950
He was smiling quite a bit!

846
00:35:22,020 --> 00:35:23,180
He was when he was playing with me!

847
00:35:23,250 --> 00:35:25,290
He was smiling, right?

848
00:35:25,350 --> 00:35:27,720
I guess, it's kind of inconclusive.

849
00:35:27,790 --> 00:35:29,290
Yeah, that's true.

850
00:35:29,360 --> 00:35:32,360
Rather than smiling, I was just... uh...

851
00:35:32,860 --> 00:35:36,560
Going like that, you know?
"Huh, I see."

852
00:35:36,630 --> 00:35:38,170
— You were smiling!

853
00:35:38,230 --> 00:35:41,100
No, I wasn't smiling.

854
00:35:41,770 --> 00:35:43,800
Rock, paper, scissors!

855
00:35:43,870 --> 00:35:45,770
Rock, paper, scissors!

856
00:35:45,840 --> 00:35:47,810
Rock, paper, scissors!

857
00:35:47,880 --> 00:35:48,880
Rock, paper—

858
00:35:52,410 --> 00:35:55,250
— That was a full out laugh!
— You could see his teeth!

859
00:35:56,480 --> 00:35:57,920
He knows he lost!

860
00:35:57,990 --> 00:35:59,950
Alright, Cookie, last chance.

861
00:36:00,020 --> 00:36:01,120
It's time!

862
00:36:01,560 --> 00:36:03,590
This is serious!

863
00:36:03,660 --> 00:36:05,690
There it is, there it is.

864
00:36:05,760 --> 00:36:07,230
Because this one was huge.

865
00:36:07,290 --> 00:36:09,330
You just have to get him to have fun.

866
00:36:09,400 --> 00:36:11,800
And since we ordered the pizza with Fujita's name,

867
00:36:12,100 --> 00:36:14,570
you're out when the delivery gets here.

868
00:36:14,640 --> 00:36:15,870
Why the hell?!

869
00:36:16,740 --> 00:36:19,040
It's complicated.

870
00:36:19,110 --> 00:36:21,170
At least make me laugh!

871
00:36:21,240 --> 00:36:22,910
Why are the rules different just for me?

872
00:36:22,980 --> 00:36:24,040
Want us to make you laugh?

873
00:36:24,110 --> 00:36:26,750
That's exactly what I want you to do!

874
00:36:26,950 --> 00:36:28,520
Making me leave without laughing is just...

875
00:36:28,520 --> 00:36:29,720
— He took the order.
— I just took the order.

876
00:36:29,720 --> 00:36:32,050
You're out even without laughing.

877
00:36:32,350 --> 00:36:36,120
Fujita, whenever you do your one-shots,

878
00:36:36,190 --> 00:36:37,760
you just have that "I wanna die" expression on your face.

879
00:36:48,770 --> 00:36:52,710
My father's enemy!

880
00:36:53,070 --> 00:36:55,680
It's just that today I kinda...

881
00:36:55,740 --> 00:36:57,010
laughed until I couldn't stand it anymore.

882
00:36:57,240 --> 00:36:58,480
I almost cried from laughter.

883
00:36:58,550 --> 00:37:01,150
It was complete insanity.

884
00:37:01,350 --> 00:37:02,650
The winner is...!
