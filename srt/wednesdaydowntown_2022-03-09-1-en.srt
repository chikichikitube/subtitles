00:00:00,720 --> 00:00:03,350
Today's Wednesday Downtown is...

2
00:00:03,450 --> 00:00:16,360
When promised an appeareance on "Championship Special", you'll gladly accepted the offer, but when it turns out you're actually a guest on the "Introducing the Crown of the World" special, it's difficult to refuse说

3
00:00:17,680 --> 00:00:20,030
The name of this theory is so long
-Yes

4
00:00:20,230 --> 00:00:24,740
In light of the fact that the number of super-long theories increase every year

5
00:00:24,740 --> 00:00:27,070
We will rank theories by the number of words they are comprised of

6
00:00:27,730 --> 00:00:31,010
Long Theory Name Ranking Special

7
00:00:31,720 --> 00:00:34,600
So, first of all, at 10th place

8
00:00:34,600 --> 00:00:37,800
4 theories with the same amount of words

9
00:00:37,800 --> 00:00:39,610
The specific word count is

10
00:00:39,680 --> 00:00:50,610
An FBI inspector who is capable of seeing the answer on an foam board, they won't jump into a hole even if they don't know the answer 说

11
00:00:51,860 --> 00:00:53,880
56 characters

12
00:00:53,880 --> 00:00:54,970
In addition to these,

13
00:00:55,970 --> 00:00:58,720
These two theories have the same number of words

14
00:00:59,390 --> 00:01:00,440
As does this...

15
00:01:01,110 --> 00:01:11,050
Even if you are told by your manager that "a weekly magazine will publish your scandal tomorrow", if you are a professional artist, you will still finish the day's work without any problems

16
00:01:11,370 --> 00:01:13,640
The method to test the theory is

17
00:01:18,360 --> 00:01:22,680
Three people who are in high spirits are targeted with a fake location shoot

18
00:01:22,680 --> 00:01:24,280
During a break,

19
00:01:24,280 --> 00:01:27,310
The scandal is revealed separately

20
00:01:30,740 --> 00:01:32,680
First of all, Nadal

21
00:01:33,670 --> 00:01:36,410
I have something to tell you
-Can't we talk about it here?

22
00:01:36,610 --> 00:01:38,090
It's a little scary

23
00:01:36,870 --> 00:01:38,610
Being brought to another room

24
00:01:38,610 --> 00:01:40,650
They are informed of content of the report

25
00:01:41,980 --> 00:01:44,050
Excuse me, I'd like to ask

26
00:01:44,050 --> 00:01:49,720
Did you go to a party with some women at the end of last year?

27
00:01:49,720 --> 00:01:51,590
The end of last year?

28
00:01:52,120 --> 00:01:55,760
Around December time

29
00:01:53,610 --> 00:01:54,510
Scary

30
00:01:55,220 --> 00:01:57,500
This must feel pretty bad

31
00:01:57,430 --> 00:02:00,430
Honestly, I didn't drink with any women

32
00:02:00,430 --> 00:02:06,270
How can I say... there are photos in this report

33
00:02:04,220 --> 00:02:06,080
A press release was also made

34
00:02:06,700 --> 00:02:08,750
So, he is given it to look at

35
00:02:08,940 --> 00:02:16,980
※Japanese law prohibits drinking alcohol under the age of 20

36
00:02:09,740 --> 00:02:13,120
"Suspected of drinking with an 18-year-old high school girl"

37
00:02:13,120 --> 00:02:15,180
A very serious scandal

38
00:02:17,380 --> 00:02:19,750
What's this? Tsk!

39
00:02:19,190 --> 00:02:20,830
You'd certainly be depressed

40
00:02:22,450 --> 00:02:24,290
What's all this writing?

41
00:02:24,290 --> 00:02:25,790
Tsk!

42
00:02:24,370 --> 00:02:27,000
He's got a bad feeling

43
00:02:27,230 --> 00:02:28,390
Minors?

44
00:02:29,030 --> 00:02:32,010
Yes, 2 months before this location shooting

45
00:02:32,750 --> 00:02:35,610
The theory began...

46
00:02:37,670 --> 00:02:40,950
Good work, everyone!

47
00:02:41,380 --> 00:02:42,860
We've certainly worked hard

48
00:02:43,430 --> 00:02:46,520
A memorable party with close comedian friends

49
00:02:47,940 --> 00:02:48,610
Sorry

50
00:02:48,610 --> 00:02:50,220
Good evening

51
00:02:50,220 --> 00:02:54,490
These ones are the type that we like

52
00:02:54,990 --> 00:02:58,980
Pretending to be a girl and her friend whom the latter comedian knows

53
00:02:56,550 --> 00:02:59,210
Very beautiful girl

54
00:02:58,980 --> 00:03:01,470
The girls begin to set the trap

55
00:02:59,210 --> 00:03:01,010
You can't do this!

56
00:03:01,010 --> 00:03:02,820
Nadal must've thought he wont the lottery with these girls

57
00:03:02,820 --> 00:03:04,920
This is bad!

58
00:03:05,500 --> 00:03:07,530
It's true that they were indeed drinking together

59
00:03:07,530 --> 00:03:10,210
So, at this time, the preparation for the theory was completed

60
00:03:09,990 --> 00:03:10,900
Indeed

61
00:03:11,420 --> 00:03:12,390
By the way,

62
00:03:12,390 --> 00:03:18,950
The girl purposely placed next to Nadal is not actually underaged, it's just a setup

63
00:03:18,830 --> 00:03:20,370
Just a setup

64
00:03:20,050 --> 00:03:23,080
One of the others brought them

65
00:03:23,080 --> 00:03:26,520
I can confirm that

66
00:03:26,520 --> 00:03:28,690
Hey? Tsk

67
00:03:28,890 --> 00:03:30,020
How old are you guys?

68
00:03:30,020 --> 00:03:31,220
I am 22 years old

69
00:03:31,220 --> 00:03:33,390
I'm 20 years old - 20 years old?

70
00:03:33,390 --> 00:03:35,060
Wait a minute, you sure you're not 19 years old?

71
00:03:35,060 --> 00:03:36,360
20 years old
-Please be serious

72
00:03:36,360 --> 00:03:39,500
We are really skirting the line of the law

73
00:03:39,500 --> 00:03:40,470
So true

74
00:03:40,630 --> 00:03:44,100
Yes, and underage drinking can be a problem, especially in this period
-It is true

75
00:03:40,630 --> 00:03:44,100
※20 year-old Tomohisa Yamashita was exposed for drinking with underage

76
00:03:44,140 --> 00:03:46,270
I seriously confirmed that she was over 20 years old

77
00:03:46,270 --> 00:03:48,510
It's the other guy that's the bad one

78
00:03:48,510 --> 00:03:50,280
This is a

79
00:03:48,510 --> 00:03:50,280
m 0 0 l 0 45 l 135 45 l 135 0

80
00:03:48,510 --> 00:03:50,280
m 0 0 l 0 45 l 135 45 l 135 0

81
00:03:48,510 --> 00:03:50,280
m 0 0 l 0 45 l 135 45 l 135 0

82
00:03:50,440 --> 00:03:51,040
Tsk

83
00:03:51,040 --> 00:03:53,650
This guy's a nutcase

84
00:03:53,650 --> 00:03:56,410
There's really something wrong with his brain

85
00:03:53,710 --> 00:03:55,580
You'd definitely be angry

86
00:03:56,410 --> 00:03:58,580
These guys in Shibuya are all the same

87
00:03:58,580 --> 00:04:00,150
These Tokyo people are all out of their minds

88
00:04:00,150 --> 00:04:03,390
Crazy people all together, crammed into a crazy place

89
00:04:03,390 --> 00:04:06,420
This is probably why weed is so big in Tokyo

90
00:04:06,690 --> 00:04:08,630
I hate Tokyo because of this

91
00:04:08,630 --> 00:04:09,960
This place has too many nutcases

92
00:04:09,960 --> 00:04:12,100
I've never met even a single decent person here

93
00:04:12,100 --> 00:04:13,000
Tsk

94
00:04:13,550 --> 00:04:17,900
Angrily turning his anger toward the entire area of Tokyo

95
00:04:17,350 --> 00:04:19,100
Hahaha why?

96
00:04:18,600 --> 00:04:19,720
Apart than that,

97
00:04:20,410 --> 00:04:22,310
I can't believe they wrote this

98
00:04:22,310 --> 00:04:24,780
This "abysmal" tag

99
00:04:24,780 --> 00:04:26,980
"Going with a minor" this sort of statement

100
00:04:26,140 --> 00:04:27,940
They'd definitely say it

101
00:04:26,980 --> 00:04:29,510
Can't believe they'd write "Abysmal, going with a minor"

102
00:04:29,180 --> 00:04:31,540
It's over, he's going crazy

103
00:04:29,510 --> 00:04:31,380
Writing this, it's really made me angry, tsk

104
00:04:31,380 --> 00:04:34,950
I only have this bad sort of press, tsk

105
00:04:34,180 --> 00:04:35,920
Always tutting

106
00:04:34,950 --> 00:04:37,320
My press is all this type of gossip

107
00:04:37,320 --> 00:04:39,890
Who even cares about this stuff anymore, tsk

108
00:04:38,440 --> 00:04:41,020
He's saying a lot to his manager

109
00:04:40,170 --> 00:04:42,650
He repeatedly says "Who cares?"

110
00:04:43,960 --> 00:04:46,830
The report also mentions matters related to "sexual harassment"

111
00:04:47,300 --> 00:04:49,370
I don't remember...

112
00:04:49,370 --> 00:04:50,300
I really don't remember

113
00:04:50,500 --> 00:04:54,410
It says in the middle of the article

114
00:04:54,410 --> 00:04:57,110
Is there any possibility you said something like that?
I didn't, no way

115
00:04:58,740 --> 00:05:00,640
"Have you had any action recently?"

116
00:05:00,640 --> 00:05:03,070
To be honest Marin is in a very dangerous situation

117
00:05:03,070 --> 00:05:06,450
It's definitely likely that you'd be targeted by men

118
00:05:06,450 --> 00:05:09,490
Have any men been after you recently?

119
00:05:09,490 --> 00:05:11,320
Have you had any action recently?

120
00:05:11,690 --> 00:05:14,430
No comment

121
00:05:14,430 --> 00:05:18,830
Marin you can hide behind this and whisper it to me

122
00:05:17,850 --> 00:05:19,620
So many questions

123
00:05:18,830 --> 00:05:20,130
But, how can I say...

124
00:05:20,130 --> 00:05:23,100
"Have you had any action recently?" isn't really a sexual harassment kind of tone

125
00:05:23,100 --> 00:05:25,400
"Have you had any action lately" is

126
00:05:25,400 --> 00:05:30,040
When I said it I was like "Have you had any action"

127
00:05:30,040 --> 00:05:32,740
Good thing the manager held back his laughter

128
00:05:34,350 --> 00:05:38,220
Just now, it went up!

129
00:05:38,350 --> 00:05:40,590
Can I talk to Yasumura later?
-I don't think so...

130
00:05:40,590 --> 00:05:43,920
This is information we are getting in advance

131
00:05:44,360 --> 00:05:48,390
So the two people there, and your wife, can't be told yet

132
00:05:49,460 --> 00:05:50,930
Ah, so painful...

133
00:05:50,930 --> 00:05:54,370
Please do not disclose it to anyone else

134
00:05:52,670 --> 00:05:54,220
Such a liar

135
00:05:54,370 --> 00:05:55,830
Still need to do the location shoot, what else needs to be recorded...

136
00:05:55,680 --> 00:05:57,090
Don't pretend, don't pretend

137
00:05:56,310 --> 00:05:59,590
And so, the result of this report

138
00:05:59,590 --> 00:06:02,590
Nadal's main concern is...

139
00:06:00,780 --> 00:06:03,940
This is so tragic

140
00:06:02,710 --> 00:06:05,910
I still have an ad. What about that?

141
00:06:05,910 --> 00:06:07,780
How can I put it? Probably also...

142
00:06:07,780 --> 00:06:10,120
Wait, slow down a sec, this is too painful

143
00:06:08,000 --> 00:06:10,220
That's too bad!

144
00:06:10,120 --> 00:06:11,820
So painful, so painful

145
00:06:11,820 --> 00:06:13,520
So painful, so painful, so painful

146
00:06:14,050 --> 00:06:14,740
Yes

147
00:06:14,740 --> 00:06:19,890
By this time, Nadal's commercial had already been shot

148
00:06:21,800 --> 00:06:23,680
No Soup Guy Curry Rice

149
00:06:23,680 --> 00:06:25,550
Curry that is fun to stir up

150
00:06:25,550 --> 00:06:27,080
Thick and hard to spill

151
00:06:27,080 --> 00:06:28,680
If it's noodles it will overflow with soup

152
00:06:28,680 --> 00:06:30,220
It's curry rice without soup

153
00:06:30,220 --> 00:06:31,210
There is really none?

154
00:06:31,210 --> 00:06:32,350
It is without

155
00:06:32,350 --> 00:06:35,440
No soup convenient curry rice

156
00:06:36,270 --> 00:06:37,480
So the ad will just disappear?

157
00:06:37,480 --> 00:06:42,810
According to the current situation, the probability is that it will be scrapped...

158
00:06:40,200 --> 00:06:42,590
If something happens, it'll definitely be canned

159
00:06:47,050 --> 00:06:49,390
Headache, headache

160
00:06:49,390 --> 00:06:51,790
My stomach hurts too

161
00:06:51,070 --> 00:06:52,470
Why does your stomach hurt?

162
00:06:51,890 --> 00:06:54,260
There is also the matter of today's location shoot

163
00:06:54,390 --> 00:06:56,830
It'll probably also be scrapped

164
00:06:56,830 --> 00:06:59,000
But please don't tell the others

165
00:06:59,000 --> 00:07:02,030
Please continue filming as if nothing has happened

166
00:07:03,440 --> 00:07:04,270
Advertisement...

167
00:07:06,270 --> 00:07:07,010
Advertisement...

168
00:07:08,840 --> 00:07:10,150
What's going on?

169
00:07:11,630 --> 00:07:13,390
Money money money

170
00:07:12,440 --> 00:07:13,240
Tsk

171
00:07:13,240 --> 00:07:15,650
This sucks

172
00:07:15,650 --> 00:07:16,550
What is there to say...

173
00:07:17,020 --> 00:07:18,350
Can't we do something? We have to get it withdrawn

174
00:07:21,950 --> 00:07:23,560
Withdrawal is really...

175
00:07:23,820 --> 00:07:27,060
I can't not have it withdrawn, these guys are writing nonsense!

176
00:07:27,060 --> 00:07:30,090
That alcohol... it was mine

177
00:07:30,100 --> 00:07:31,800
Yeah...

178
00:07:30,100 --> 00:07:31,810
No shit!

179
00:07:32,800 --> 00:07:35,570
Hikaku paid...

180
00:07:35,050 --> 00:07:36,720
You didn't pay!?

181
00:07:35,570 --> 00:07:38,370
I really dont want to lose the advert

182
00:07:38,370 --> 00:07:41,440
And so, he submits a request for withdrawal

183
00:07:40,770 --> 00:07:42,600
This guy!

184
00:07:42,040 --> 00:07:44,110
Get them to withdraw the article

185
00:07:42,600 --> 00:07:44,120
This guy is really something

186
00:07:44,110 --> 00:07:45,940
Seriously, how can we give in to this type of people

187
00:07:46,760 --> 00:07:49,180
They're looking down on Yoshimoto

188
00:07:49,180 --> 00:07:50,720
They do this kind of thing to blackmail people

189
00:07:50,720 --> 00:07:53,490
This can't be done. This is a mess

190
00:07:53,490 --> 00:07:54,950
Tsk, ahh...

191
00:07:55,830 --> 00:07:57,000
So much to say!

192
00:07:56,820 --> 00:07:58,260
If it does get published

193
00:07:57,000 --> 00:07:58,400
Little mouth blazing

194
00:07:58,760 --> 00:08:01,130
Tsk! Ah!

195
00:08:01,130 --> 00:08:04,860
Withdraw the article

196
00:08:04,860 --> 00:08:06,930
Just do it!

197
00:08:07,120 --> 00:08:10,340
I really hope they will!

198
00:08:10,340 --> 00:08:10,800
Ha...

199
00:08:10,800 --> 00:08:13,170
This article is to be released

200
00:08:14,310 --> 00:08:15,770
Shh!

201
00:08:15,770 --> 00:08:16,370
Or... in all seriousness...

202
00:08:16,370 --> 00:08:17,910
Shh, shh, shh, shh!

203
00:08:17,910 --> 00:08:20,140
I know

204
00:08:20,020 --> 00:08:21,870
He's getting louder

205
00:08:21,410 --> 00:08:23,650
It sucks. It's so painful

206
00:08:25,110 --> 00:08:27,560
What is this cough?

207
00:08:25,950 --> 00:08:27,550
Damn, I don't feel well

208
00:08:28,490 --> 00:08:30,560
This cough is definitely fake

209
00:08:30,310 --> 00:08:32,880
Shriveling up straight away

210
00:08:32,880 --> 00:08:35,390
He begins to feel unwell

211
00:08:35,110 --> 00:08:38,530
Suddenly feeling unwell

212
00:08:36,260 --> 00:08:37,800
Sorry to interrupt

213
00:08:36,690 --> 00:08:39,800
The magazine's press release

214
00:08:38,530 --> 00:08:40,730
So many lies

215
00:08:41,160 --> 00:08:44,060
Must be painful

216
00:08:43,270 --> 00:08:45,310
Recording continues

217
00:08:46,170 --> 00:08:47,760
What will happen?

218
00:08:47,780 --> 00:08:49,120
What will become of it?

219
00:08:49,450 --> 00:08:51,040
Thank you
-Hello everyone

220
00:08:51,080 --> 00:08:52,410
Great!

221
00:08:53,110 --> 00:08:53,950
Yes!

222
00:08:54,590 --> 00:08:57,300
Something's off

223
00:08:57,900 --> 00:08:59,200
Just a little

224
00:09:00,430 --> 00:09:00,950
What is this?

225
00:09:01,190 --> 00:09:03,920
The energy is all off!

226
00:09:10,850 --> 00:09:14,610
Contrasting the two who are still in high spirits

227
00:09:13,350 --> 00:09:15,190
No sound at all

228
00:09:15,960 --> 00:09:20,480
Nadal is moody in comparison to before

229
00:09:21,480 --> 00:09:24,700
So, the next step is to tell Yasumura

230
00:09:26,080 --> 00:09:29,010
That…

231
00:09:29,010 --> 00:09:31,420
I've received some... bad reports

232
00:09:31,420 --> 00:09:33,720
Eh？

233
00:09:34,590 --> 00:09:37,210
The most uncomfortable point in time

234
00:09:34,750 --> 00:09:37,220
Eh？

235
00:09:37,840 --> 00:09:40,430
18 year-old female high school student

236
00:09:40,960 --> 00:09:42,350
It's over

237
00:09:46,830 --> 00:09:49,770
"Decided to report Yasumura"

238
00:09:50,130 --> 00:09:54,740
I asked her age, she said "20 years old"

239
00:09:55,410 --> 00:09:58,080
So I'm not a criminal, right?

240
00:10:01,270 --> 00:10:03,450
This is the end!

241
00:10:03,450 --> 00:10:06,350
Do I need a lawsuit?

242
00:10:06,340 --> 00:10:09,050
There was sexual harassment, right?

243
00:10:10,390 --> 00:10:11,820
Sexual harassment?

244
00:10:12,490 --> 00:10:13,990
Yasumura's already drunk, right?

245
00:10:14,260 --> 00:10:15,760
Not drunk yet

246
00:10:18,100 --> 00:10:19,400
Already drunk

247
00:10:19,400 --> 00:10:21,270
Ah, I'm drunk

248
00:10:21,430 --> 00:10:24,050
"I didn't want to look, but he made me look at his nipples"

249
00:10:24,050 --> 00:10:27,270
"and forced me to toast by touching a glass to his nipples"

250
00:10:27,270 --> 00:10:29,470
I guess it's true

251
00:10:29,910 --> 00:10:31,340
You did it?

252
00:10:30,400 --> 00:10:31,900
You really did it!

253
00:10:31,340 --> 00:10:34,580
I did show her my nipples

254
00:10:32,730 --> 00:10:34,510
What the hell?

255
00:10:36,810 --> 00:10:38,620
Pull down from the top!

256
00:10:38,620 --> 00:10:40,890
The worst thing to do

257
00:10:38,830 --> 00:10:40,600
So awful!

258
00:10:40,890 --> 00:10:42,320
Nipple Toast

259
00:10:42,680 --> 00:10:44,290
What the hell? Nipple toast?

260
00:10:43,550 --> 00:10:45,060
So cold!

261
00:10:47,050 --> 00:10:48,860
Seems to be enjoying himself

262
00:10:47,130 --> 00:10:50,250
So yes, the party was full of sexual harassment, so to speak

263
00:10:50,260 --> 00:10:51,790
So rotten

264
00:10:51,160 --> 00:10:54,030
If this is true, then I'm afraid...

265
00:10:56,300 --> 00:10:59,840
I'll definitely be fired, especially in this day and age...

266
00:11:00,170 --> 00:11:02,740
In the case of dismissal...
-Worst case scenario is dismissal, but thats the worst case scenario

267
00:11:02,740 --> 00:11:08,210
Well... actually 99% of people would be fired, right?

268
00:11:08,210 --> 00:11:10,980
It's still inside information

269
00:11:10,980 --> 00:11:14,520
Fact checking of those involved is still in progress

270
00:11:14,520 --> 00:11:17,290
Anyway, today we have to work as usual

271
00:11:15,880 --> 00:11:18,490
The manager is really convincing

272
00:11:17,290 --> 00:11:19,860
That's what needs to happen?

273
00:11:21,890 --> 00:11:24,400
It is because fact checking is needed as soon as possible

274
00:11:22,650 --> 00:11:26,170
This Yoshimoto agent is probably used to this kind of situation

275
00:11:24,400 --> 00:11:27,170
So I have to inform you of this situation

276
00:11:27,170 --> 00:11:29,800
Is this how it's going to be? Continue with this location shoot

277
00:11:30,350 --> 00:11:33,370
So, Yasumura returns to the scene with a sense of retirement

278
00:11:33,370 --> 00:11:35,500
Recording continues

279
00:11:36,550 --> 00:11:38,010
How did it turn out?

280
00:11:38,900 --> 00:11:39,640
Thank you

281
00:11:39,640 --> 00:11:41,150
OK

282
00:11:43,450 --> 00:11:44,720
Next up

283
00:11:44,720 --> 00:11:46,350
Popularity among women matchup

284
00:11:44,720 --> 00:11:46,900
Only Ogata is left to rush forward

285
00:11:46,350 --> 00:11:47,750
Wow!

286
00:11:48,200 --> 00:11:52,650
Yasumura now doesn't know where or how to direct his energy

287
00:11:53,170 --> 00:11:58,410
30 minutes ago, the Yasumura was very cheerful

288
00:11:58,410 --> 00:12:01,260
Became the Yasumura that is unable to play dumb

289
00:12:03,630 --> 00:12:04,770
Even

290
00:12:05,490 --> 00:12:06,800
0 points

291
00:12:06,800 --> 00:12:08,620
I'm overwhelmingly superior!

292
00:12:09,160 --> 00:12:14,100
From time to time, sad memories suddenly come rushing to Yasumura

293
00:12:13,900 --> 00:12:15,660
So pitiful looking

294
00:12:15,720 --> 00:12:18,900
Onto the final target, Ogata

295
00:12:21,500 --> 00:12:23,620
This will be the end if it comes out

296
00:12:24,640 --> 00:12:26,430
Drinking with underage people

297
00:12:26,430 --> 00:12:28,110
Yes, minors

298
00:12:28,110 --> 00:12:31,330
"Drinking, but no thank you"

299
00:12:33,000 --> 00:12:34,800
Using my line in such a way...

300
00:12:34,800 --> 00:12:36,230
This terminology is completely finished

301
00:12:36,230 --> 00:12:38,540
It's done with

302
00:12:38,840 --> 00:12:41,910
This girl is only 18?
-18

303
00:12:41,910 --> 00:12:45,040
Doesn't she not look that young?

304
00:12:45,040 --> 00:12:47,250
No, how can I put it...

305
00:12:47,250 --> 00:12:49,610
She didn't look that young... she even had grey hair

306
00:12:51,000 --> 00:12:52,620
Absolutely not

307
00:12:52,620 --> 00:12:54,390
Would you drink with people like that?

308
00:12:54,450 --> 00:12:56,450
Not only did she have gray hair...

309
00:12:56,450 --> 00:13:00,890
But her skin didn't look very smooth either, skin really wasn't that good

310
00:12:58,830 --> 00:13:00,640
That doesn't matter

311
00:13:00,890 --> 00:13:02,930
In addition to this, there is a problem

312
00:13:02,930 --> 00:13:05,360
Ah, what's wrong?
-It's written here

313
00:13:06,970 --> 00:13:09,960
Behavior related to sexual harassment

314
00:13:10,470 --> 00:13:12,440
Did this actually happen?

315
00:13:12,640 --> 00:13:15,710
There was no sexual harassment
-Really?

316
00:13:15,710 --> 00:13:17,040
Really, I swear I didn't

317
00:13:17,380 --> 00:13:19,810
I have a wife and children

318
00:13:19,810 --> 00:13:22,010
I still have to pay the loan on my house off for 33 years

319
00:13:22,010 --> 00:13:23,650
Why would I do something like that?

320
00:13:23,880 --> 00:13:24,920
I'm not doubting you

321
00:13:24,920 --> 00:13:27,020
What can I say? For the modern day Yoshimoto...

322
00:13:27,020 --> 00:13:28,620
Lying is really unforgivable

323
00:13:29,250 --> 00:13:30,190
I know

324
00:13:29,450 --> 00:13:31,270
Too convincing

325
00:13:30,190 --> 00:13:34,260
No, if it's a lie...

326
00:13:34,260 --> 00:13:34,660
Yes...

327
00:13:35,330 --> 00:13:38,760
Does what's written here match the facts?

328
00:13:35,910 --> 00:13:38,270
What the hell, is it or not

329
00:13:40,330 --> 00:13:43,400
The phrase "want to get it on" was said

330
00:13:43,400 --> 00:13:44,070
Did you say it?

331
00:13:44,070 --> 00:13:45,470
Just as a joke

332
00:13:45,640 --> 00:13:50,410
It's really more fun to drink with girls like this

333
00:13:50,410 --> 00:13:54,280
Want to get it on ah, want to get it on ah

334
00:13:54,420 --> 00:13:55,800
What about the hair?

335
00:13:58,820 --> 00:14:00,220
Did you smell it?

336
00:14:03,020 --> 00:14:06,720
Yeah, I think I smelled it...

337
00:14:07,340 --> 00:14:11,420
But there was no actual contact with the hair

338
00:14:12,740 --> 00:14:16,750
It is unclear why Ogata confessed to a crime he didn't commit

339
00:14:18,040 --> 00:14:23,900
Perhaps if pressed hard enough, they'll confess regardless

340
00:14:25,060 --> 00:14:29,080
No... is smelling someone's hair something that is forbidden to do?

341
00:14:28,040 --> 00:14:29,930
You didn't smell it!

342
00:14:29,080 --> 00:14:33,150
What is this, which law says you can't do such a thing?

343
00:14:33,150 --> 00:14:34,620
Sexual harassment is defined as

344
00:14:34,620 --> 00:14:37,790
The moment the other person feels uncomfortable, it constitutes sexual harassment

345
00:14:38,260 --> 00:14:39,960
Wait a minute, I'm begging you...

346
00:14:39,960 --> 00:14:43,760
It's unclear how this will be handled

347
00:14:43,760 --> 00:14:45,400
But the publication is certain

348
00:14:45,400 --> 00:14:49,670
No... what can I do after?

349
00:14:50,040 --> 00:14:53,430
The thought that this won't blow over comes into play

350
00:14:53,430 --> 00:14:54,520
At this point

351
00:14:55,370 --> 00:14:57,810
Will everyone there be involved?

352
00:14:59,010 --> 00:15:02,210
Can the others be blocked out?

353
00:15:02,210 --> 00:15:06,050
It's going to be published either way, so maybe then can avoid taking heat for it

354
00:15:04,700 --> 00:15:05,480
He's taking responsibility

355
00:15:06,050 --> 00:15:06,920
This way, the others involved...

356
00:15:06,920 --> 00:15:09,620
There's no need to involve all of them, right?

357
00:15:10,170 --> 00:15:12,080
The manliness of Ogata,

358
00:15:12,080 --> 00:15:13,750
Brings an end to this section

359
00:15:13,750 --> 00:15:16,110
And the location shoot continues

360
00:15:15,790 --> 00:15:18,010
By this point all three must be emotionally drained

361
00:15:17,940 --> 00:15:18,920
And so,

362
00:15:21,130 --> 00:15:23,530
Ah…

363
00:15:26,250 --> 00:15:29,050
What a gloomy scene this is

364
00:15:31,280 --> 00:15:34,670
The room resembles a funeral scene

365
00:15:37,380 --> 00:15:43,790
And so, the location recording, which everyone was sure would be scrapped, resumes

366
00:15:57,380 --> 00:15:58,140
5 seconds till start

367
00:15:58,140 --> 00:16:00,710
4 3 2

368
00:15:59,530 --> 00:16:01,060
What will happen?

369
00:16:00,710 --> 00:16:02,210
Ok...

370
00:16:03,790 --> 00:16:05,630
It's completely different

371
00:16:05,370 --> 00:16:09,280
2 hours ago, the recording began with incredibly high energy

372
00:16:08,730 --> 00:16:11,230
That's so funny

373
00:16:11,230 --> 00:16:13,390
Can only clap their hands

374
00:16:13,950 --> 00:16:18,860
A calm atmosphere makes one wonder if its a different program

375
00:16:17,910 --> 00:16:20,400
At least they all turned up

376
00:16:21,290 --> 00:16:23,310
Perform properly!

377
00:16:23,470 --> 00:16:26,720
One of the most obvious is Ogata

378
00:16:26,880 --> 00:16:28,720
He's just been told after all

379
00:16:27,290 --> 00:16:30,580
Lets complete to find the best place to go in Venus Fort!

380
00:16:29,690 --> 00:16:31,460
Nadal is still working hard

381
00:16:30,580 --> 00:16:32,550
Please feel free to walk around the building

382
00:16:32,550 --> 00:16:34,280
Raise your hand when you find it

383
00:16:34,280 --> 00:16:35,470
Ok

384
00:16:36,270 --> 00:16:40,910
It seems that tears are falling

385
00:16:40,450 --> 00:16:43,450
Nothing can be done, you've still got family at least

386
00:16:43,350 --> 00:16:46,180
It's really bad...

387
00:16:47,640 --> 00:16:50,220
After that, a fortune teller is visited

388
00:16:50,220 --> 00:16:53,260
And all recording for the day is finished

389
00:16:55,740 --> 00:16:58,960
Afterwards, for the three people who left the scene

390
00:16:58,960 --> 00:17:02,380
Fake weekly reporters arrive for surprise interviews

391
00:17:03,240 --> 00:17:06,210
How will they react?

392
00:17:03,440 --> 00:17:05,780
Really a full set of drama, eh?

393
00:17:06,350 --> 00:17:10,110
Three people? Three people together?

394
00:17:15,750 --> 00:17:17,820
Thank you for your hard work. Sorry to interrupt

395
00:17:17,820 --> 00:17:20,580
About the report of drinking with minors

396
00:17:20,580 --> 00:17:24,920
Is there any discrepancy with the truth?
-I'm very sorry. I'm very sorry.

397
00:17:24,920 --> 00:17:29,830
You're admitting it? Admitting it happened? That's the truth, right?
-I'm sorry

398
00:17:29,830 --> 00:17:33,660
No... I didn't ask her age, I'm sorry

399
00:17:33,660 --> 00:17:35,970
Is this your confession?

400
00:17:35,970 --> 00:17:39,870
No... I...

401
00:17:40,070 --> 00:17:41,970
Yes, this...

402
00:17:43,370 --> 00:17:45,440
Yes

403
00:17:45,440 --> 00:17:47,850
Because the age wasn't confirmed

404
00:17:47,850 --> 00:17:50,880
Eh?
-Sorry

405
00:17:50,880 --> 00:17:52,180
Ogata? Who are you referring to?

406
00:17:52,180 --> 00:17:55,290
Ogata?
-It's me

407
00:17:55,290 --> 00:17:58,390
Uh, me too...
-I don't think so

408
00:17:56,440 --> 00:17:57,620
"Me too"

409
00:17:58,390 --> 00:18:01,990
I've also been told...

410
00:18:02,230 --> 00:18:04,530
Hey, why... Yasumura too?

411
00:18:04,530 --> 00:18:07,230
I was also told before that I was drinking with an underage girl

412
00:18:07,230 --> 00:18:09,070
My manager said during the break

413
00:18:09,200 --> 00:18:10,840
Sexual Harassment
-Yeah sexual harassment!

414
00:18:10,840 --> 00:18:13,470
Ah, then it's the same

415
00:18:13,470 --> 00:18:16,440
Well, you can also apologize, together we can...

416
00:18:16,440 --> 00:18:18,610
Me too

417
00:18:18,610 --> 00:18:21,710
Eh, what's going on here?

418
00:18:21,710 --> 00:18:23,710
Hold on a second
-Wait a minute!

419
00:18:23,710 --> 00:18:27,220
Hey, what's going on?
-No, I was...

420
00:18:28,250 --> 00:18:29,850
Eh, wait a minute, eh?

421
00:18:29,270 --> 00:18:31,690
So interesting

422
00:18:30,390 --> 00:18:33,620
And so, the situation was revealed

423
00:18:33,990 --> 00:18:36,860
Wow, so it was the same person?
-Really?

424
00:18:36,860 --> 00:18:38,460
That's great. That's really great

425
00:18:38,760 --> 00:18:41,530
That's great. Such a terrible thing...
-So close

426
00:18:41,530 --> 00:18:44,300
It won't be published, right?

427
00:18:44,300 --> 00:18:47,840
Wow, that's great
-I'm so happy!

428
00:18:47,840 --> 00:18:51,110
I thought I was going to die this time, really
-So dangerous

429
00:18:51,110 --> 00:18:52,840
You don't know how terrible I felt...

430
00:18:53,000 --> 00:18:57,960
Next is the 9th super long theory

431
00:18:58,470 --> 00:19:01,530
With a total of 57 characters

432
00:19:02,830 --> 00:19:12,730
When encountering a middle-aged man wearing a bowler hat and holding a cane in an unusually long alleyway, you'll be extremely cautious

433
00:19:11,780 --> 00:19:12,740
That's for sure!

434
00:19:13,420 --> 00:19:20,330
Ungirls' Tanaka is called to a fake meeting

435
00:19:18,210 --> 00:19:19,100
Tanaka

436
00:19:19,100 --> 00:19:21,080
How will Tanaka react?

437
00:19:21,010 --> 00:19:25,350
The meeting room is inside
-Good, good

438
00:19:25,170 --> 00:19:26,560
Too weird

439
00:19:26,560 --> 00:19:27,960
So that's the setup

440
00:19:26,920 --> 00:19:31,120
Tanaka is lured through this area with various outrageous reasons

441
00:19:27,960 --> 00:19:29,430
It's like that

442
00:19:29,430 --> 00:19:31,430
Yeah

443
00:19:31,890 --> 00:19:35,390
From directly ahead, the strangely-dressed middle-aged man is released

444
00:19:36,230 --> 00:19:37,760
What is the result?

445
00:19:36,450 --> 00:19:37,760
That's definitely the guy

446
00:19:37,760 --> 00:19:39,300
Looks like it

447
00:19:39,300 --> 00:19:40,320
He'll certainly shout

448
00:19:40,320 --> 00:19:41,790
How can there be such a person

449
00:19:41,790 --> 00:19:43,440
Absolutely shout

450
00:19:55,590 --> 00:19:56,950
Waiting for him to say hello?

451
00:19:58,980 --> 00:20:00,620
Ah…

452
00:20:01,020 --> 00:20:03,150
A little bit too cautious, right?

453
00:20:04,530 --> 00:20:06,060
A bit wary

454
00:20:04,530 --> 00:20:08,130
Sure enough, he's wary

455
00:20:10,670 --> 00:20:12,670
The theory is thus proved correct

456
00:20:13,440 --> 00:20:16,530
As this has proved to be a good opportunity, we continue experimenting

457
00:20:16,870 --> 00:20:18,640
Can't you just shout?

458
00:20:18,640 --> 00:20:20,640
It's very simple, anyone can do it

459
00:20:21,700 --> 00:20:28,650
Tanaka is then forced to watch as the AD asks the extra why he didn't shout in the distance

460
00:20:29,350 --> 00:20:33,150
Is it alright if we walk back again... from there?

461
00:20:33,150 --> 00:20:34,750
Can we go back?
-Ok...

462
00:20:35,040 --> 00:20:36,860
Too tiring

463
00:20:35,790 --> 00:20:39,520
The staff requests a second take

464
00:20:38,140 --> 00:20:39,520
He already knows

465
00:20:49,460 --> 00:20:50,930
Still wont shout, right?

466
00:20:50,520 --> 00:20:54,000
Still, the shout doesn't materialize

467
00:20:54,780 --> 00:20:56,000
So...

468
00:20:56,000 --> 00:20:57,770
What's going on?
-I'm sorry

469
00:20:56,360 --> 00:20:58,060
Why didn't you shout?

470
00:20:58,170 --> 00:21:00,940
You're supposed to yell when you get right next to him, right?
-Yes, sorry

471
00:21:01,210 --> 00:21:03,680
Can you do it? Do you need to practice?

472
00:21:03,160 --> 00:21:04,590
Looking straight at them

473
00:21:04,050 --> 00:21:05,080
Please do it

474
00:21:05,080 --> 00:21:06,070
OI!!!!

475
00:21:06,070 --> 00:21:07,350
Louder

476
00:21:07,350 --> 00:21:08,320
OI!!!

477
00:21:08,320 --> 00:21:09,350
Louder!

478
00:21:09,350 --> 00:21:10,250
OI!!!

479
00:21:10,250 --> 00:21:11,790
Still not loud enough

480
00:21:11,790 --> 00:21:12,980
OI!!!

481
00:21:13,330 --> 00:21:14,980
Shout it out, shout it out!

482
00:21:13,640 --> 00:21:17,400
With the unexpected occurrence of seeing someone practice how to shout from a distance

483
00:21:17,400 --> 00:21:19,400
Shouted out so loudly already

484
00:21:17,820 --> 00:21:20,950
Tanaka couldn't help but laugh

485
00:21:19,430 --> 00:21:20,950
How can it be so obviously visible

486
00:21:22,510 --> 00:21:24,550
And so, the third take begins

487
00:21:23,470 --> 00:21:24,550
Third already

488
00:21:24,550 --> 00:21:26,040
The others were all the same

489
00:21:26,410 --> 00:21:28,100
How will it turn out I wonder

490
00:21:29,350 --> 00:21:30,450
OI!!!

491
00:21:30,450 --> 00:21:31,810
Wrong, wrong

492
00:21:32,560 --> 00:21:33,810
OI!!!

493
00:21:34,510 --> 00:21:37,650
You did it wrong...

494
00:21:38,710 --> 00:21:40,790
Yeah, seriously

495
00:21:41,560 --> 00:21:43,380
Too exhausting

496
00:21:41,650 --> 00:21:42,850
Did it wrong...

497
00:21:43,630 --> 00:21:46,430
And so the truth is revealed

498
00:21:46,960 --> 00:21:49,190
What? What? What is this?

499
00:21:49,190 --> 00:21:51,500
I don't get you guys

500
00:21:51,830 --> 00:21:54,060
"Being suspiciously lead into a long alley way backstage"

501
00:21:54,060 --> 00:21:56,730
"When a middle-aged man with weird style walks past"

502
00:21:56,730 --> 00:21:58,230
"You'd be wary"

503
00:22:02,170 --> 00:22:04,650
Yes, it's a time to be vigilant

504
00:22:04,650 --> 00:22:06,910
At first...at first I

505
00:22:06,910 --> 00:22:11,080
The fact that I knew what was going on was obvious from my face

506
00:22:09,600 --> 00:22:11,160
It was obvious

507
00:22:11,080 --> 00:22:12,410
Yeah
-Right!?

508
00:22:12,780 --> 00:22:15,220
This disqualifies me as an entertainer

509
00:22:16,130 --> 00:22:23,560
Next at 8th place with 59 characters are these 2 theories from last year

510
00:22:23,560 --> 00:22:25,830
The third was...

511
00:22:26,580 --> 00:22:38,180
When arguing endlessly on the phone, to show they are right, the first thing the person will say after hanging up is "See?"

512
00:22:39,180 --> 00:22:41,070
So, the verification begins

513
00:22:41,730 --> 00:22:43,370
Komen...

514
00:22:43,450 --> 00:22:48,320
By the way, he's a junior high school graduate, right?

515
00:22:48,320 --> 00:22:51,650
They say he's a junior high school graduate

516
00:22:51,650 --> 00:22:52,920
He actually graduated from high school

517
00:22:53,490 --> 00:22:55,720
No... junior high school graduation, right?

518
00:22:55,720 --> 00:22:57,960
He's not a junior high school graduate

519
00:22:58,440 --> 00:23:00,930
Eh, really?
-Yeah

520
00:23:00,930 --> 00:23:02,030
Really?

521
00:23:02,030 --> 00:23:04,270
Eh? No way!

522
00:23:04,270 --> 00:23:08,220
A debate begins

523
00:23:08,220 --> 00:23:09,410
What a tiresome argument

524
00:23:08,700 --> 00:23:11,670
I want to make sure, seriously

525
00:23:11,710 --> 00:23:13,340
Hello?

526
00:23:13,340 --> 00:23:16,080
Sorry to trouble you, Komen

527
00:23:16,080 --> 00:23:17,950
Tsuneida is wondering...

528
00:23:18,780 --> 00:23:20,500
We're both drinking

529
00:23:20,500 --> 00:23:23,950
And he's talking nonsense

530
00:23:23,950 --> 00:23:27,960
He says you're a junior high school graduate, but you're a high school graduate, right?

531
00:23:30,410 --> 00:23:31,590
Right?

532
00:23:31,590 --> 00:23:34,120
Komen is actually a high school graduate

533
00:23:34,720 --> 00:23:37,910
So, will he say "See!"?

534
00:23:37,660 --> 00:23:39,180
It depends on when you hang up

535
00:23:38,630 --> 00:23:40,300
Okay, sorry

536
00:23:40,160 --> 00:23:41,930
Here we go, will he say it?

537
00:23:45,670 --> 00:23:47,080
You were saying?

538
00:23:48,340 --> 00:23:49,680
Didn't say it

539
00:23:50,330 --> 00:23:54,700
The next item on the list in 7th place is 3 60-character theories

540
00:23:54,700 --> 00:23:55,790
First of all

541
00:23:56,120 --> 00:24:09,360
For smoker comedians, if their cigarette is lit, even if the staff looks pale and says, "Your partner has fainted," he will not throw away the cigarette but will take a puff first

542
00:24:14,170 --> 00:24:16,370
In any case, you must immediately put out the cigarette

543
00:24:17,540 --> 00:24:20,210
Itakura has fainted

544
00:24:20,210 --> 00:24:22,630
He suddenly fell down clutching his chest

545
00:24:24,180 --> 00:24:26,180
What do we do?

546
00:24:26,180 --> 00:24:28,380
Can you come?

547
00:24:28,380 --> 00:24:30,380
Let's go

548
00:24:31,210 --> 00:24:32,290
Took a few puffs

549
00:24:32,290 --> 00:24:33,890
This one took two puffs

550
00:24:35,620 --> 00:24:36,860
Such a big puff, such a big puff

551
00:24:37,700 --> 00:24:38,890
Hesitantly hesitated

552
00:24:38,920 --> 00:24:40,660
What a big mouthful!

553
00:24:39,860 --> 00:24:40,660
Inhaled

554
00:24:40,660 --> 00:24:42,400
Look! Look at the lag time!

555
00:24:42,040 --> 00:24:44,450
This scumbag adult, such a big puff

556
00:24:43,230 --> 00:24:49,630
Before rushing to his partner's side, he quickly puffs away

557
00:24:49,190 --> 00:24:50,370
It lasted for a while

558
00:24:50,370 --> 00:24:51,730
Two strong puffs

559
00:24:51,730 --> 00:24:53,950
He was really smoking!

560
00:24:52,920 --> 00:24:55,540
So, the truth is revealed

561
00:25:02,250 --> 00:25:03,190
Eh?

562
00:25:03,190 --> 00:25:04,790
No, no, no, no. What?

563
00:25:04,790 --> 00:25:05,750
Didn't you faint?

564
00:25:05,750 --> 00:25:07,500
Fainted...

565
00:25:07,500 --> 00:25:08,860
No, then you're not... eh?

566
00:25:08,860 --> 00:25:10,790
I fainted and yet i'm the last consideration

567
00:25:12,010 --> 00:25:13,100
What's wrong with you?

568
00:25:13,100 --> 00:25:13,930
What the hell is this?

569
00:25:14,200 --> 00:25:17,700
Seriously, you're a terrible person
-What? Did I smoke?

570
00:25:16,100 --> 00:25:17,150
Hopeless

571
00:25:17,710 --> 00:25:19,740
Someone says to you "Your partner fainted"

572
00:25:19,740 --> 00:25:21,500
You "Hey? Really? I see."

573
00:25:23,210 --> 00:25:23,840
Is it reasonable?

574
00:25:23,840 --> 00:25:25,270
What, what is this?

575
00:25:25,270 --> 00:25:25,910
What the hell?

576
00:25:25,910 --> 00:25:28,340
The embers were blazing!

577
00:25:28,340 --> 00:25:30,110
Orange fire glowing brightly

578
00:25:30,110 --> 00:25:31,210
What are you doing to me?

579
00:25:31,450 --> 00:25:36,790
Why am I being mentally disturbed by this damn show

580
00:25:35,820 --> 00:25:36,790
It's too much

581
00:25:37,380 --> 00:25:42,370
The remaining 2 in 7th place are the chick theory and...

582
00:25:43,390 --> 00:25:55,710
Baseball teams with kids who can just about step up to the batting cage have too small a strike zone and can thus win due to foul balls

583
00:25:56,440 --> 00:26:03,220
The No.1 batter is the shortest child on the team, Takeouchi Hayate, who is 2 years and 1 month old.

584
00:26:01,720 --> 00:26:04,040
Just 2 years and 1 month

585
00:26:03,220 --> 00:26:05,560
Height 83cm

586
00:26:05,560 --> 00:26:06,570
You can do it!

587
00:26:06,580 --> 00:26:08,580
Aim over there

588
00:26:08,580 --> 00:26:09,920
Let's get started. One, two,

589
00:26:12,550 --> 00:26:13,880
Here comes the ball!

590
00:26:14,400 --> 00:26:15,990
Looking at mom

591
00:26:15,990 --> 00:26:18,340
Look at the pitcher!

592
00:26:18,340 --> 00:26:19,930
Depends on the pitcher

593
00:26:20,690 --> 00:26:21,650
Foul

594
00:26:22,080 --> 00:26:23,910
It's high. It's a little high

595
00:26:23,420 --> 00:26:26,470
Generally speaking this ball is on the low side

596
00:26:26,950 --> 00:26:30,250
But this time it was on the high side

597
00:26:29,830 --> 00:26:31,240
Good foul ball

598
00:26:30,640 --> 00:26:33,280
So small

599
00:26:33,990 --> 00:26:34,810
Look over there

600
00:26:35,080 --> 00:26:36,780
Over there

601
00:26:36,780 --> 00:26:38,710
Look at the big brother over there

602
00:26:39,290 --> 00:26:40,670
Mamma

603
00:26:40,670 --> 00:26:43,150
The next 2nd ball

604
00:26:45,900 --> 00:26:46,900
Strike

605
00:26:47,750 --> 00:26:49,170
Good shot

606
00:26:49,170 --> 00:26:53,710
With strong adaptability, the second pitch was a strike

607
00:26:53,710 --> 00:26:55,300
However, afterwards

608
00:26:56,390 --> 00:26:58,310
High, too high!

609
00:26:59,400 --> 00:27:00,890
Too high!

610
00:27:00,890 --> 00:27:03,530
Frequent foul balls

611
00:27:02,500 --> 00:27:04,070
Just OK

612
00:27:04,550 --> 00:27:08,760
Later, two good and three foul balls

613
00:27:08,760 --> 00:27:10,380
Not even watching

614
00:27:10,380 --> 00:27:11,510
It's over

615
00:27:14,830 --> 00:27:18,050
The No. 1 hitter cries

616
00:27:17,570 --> 00:27:18,830
It's fine, it's fine

617
00:27:18,690 --> 00:27:21,740
So the game was suspended

618
00:27:21,740 --> 00:27:24,660
Afterwards, after 10 minutes of mom's reassurance

619
00:27:24,210 --> 00:27:25,210
So long

620
00:27:24,960 --> 00:27:27,330
Stay here. Don't move

621
00:27:27,980 --> 00:27:30,400
Look at the toy, look

622
00:27:32,020 --> 00:27:33,690
Smile

623
00:27:33,400 --> 00:27:35,900
Guaranteed success

624
00:27:34,890 --> 00:27:36,370
No more crying

625
00:27:36,610 --> 00:27:42,730
Throwing while his attention is elsehwere

626
00:27:43,580 --> 00:27:46,120
It is really too difficult

627
00:27:46,120 --> 00:27:51,720
The height is too small resulting in great difficulty

628
00:27:51,720 --> 00:27:54,690
Smaller than I expected

629
00:27:55,600 --> 00:27:57,290
The same goes for the second person

630
00:28:00,050 --> 00:28:03,430
The ball height is not low enough to guarantee delivery

631
00:28:04,220 --> 00:28:09,030
And so, in line with the theory, runners are located on first and second base

632
00:28:10,060 --> 00:28:12,610
The third batter steps up

633
00:28:14,710 --> 00:28:15,670
Swing

634
00:28:15,670 --> 00:28:16,750
Strike

635
00:28:17,310 --> 00:28:18,820
It's still possible

636
00:28:18,820 --> 00:28:20,120
Swinging the bat

637
00:28:19,730 --> 00:28:23,820
Suddenly, having a vague understanding of baseball becomes an achilles' heel

638
00:28:24,180 --> 00:28:25,650
Swing

639
00:28:25,650 --> 00:28:26,820
Strike three

640
00:28:27,640 --> 00:28:31,800
Due to swinging at every ball, the batter strikes out

641
00:28:31,800 --> 00:28:35,460
Swinging the bat helped give me points

642
00:28:35,970 --> 00:28:39,230
No. 4 is also struck out

643
00:28:39,960 --> 00:28:43,530
Number 5 is also guaranteed

644
00:28:42,820 --> 00:28:43,990
Bases are loaded

645
00:28:43,990 --> 00:28:47,650
The bases are now loaded and the pitcher is in crisis

646
00:28:47,290 --> 00:28:49,060
Is this how you play baseball?

647
00:28:47,650 --> 00:28:48,480
Not only that

648
00:28:55,610 --> 00:28:59,480
2 outs with bases loaded and balls in play

649
00:29:00,260 --> 00:29:02,160
Come on!

650
00:29:01,790 --> 00:29:02,960
Great fighting spirit!

651
00:29:02,960 --> 00:29:06,240
This is the moment when a man must draw out his power

652
00:29:09,070 --> 00:29:10,540
Don't swing it, don't swing it

653
00:29:12,070 --> 00:29:12,970
Strike three!

654
00:29:12,970 --> 00:29:15,000
Awesome!

655
00:29:15,000 --> 00:29:17,300
Safe!

656
00:29:17,710 --> 00:29:20,160
Super Long Theory Ranking

657
00:29:20,160 --> 00:29:23,340
Next is this theory for 6th place

658
00:29:23,340 --> 00:29:25,410
and another

659
00:29:26,430 --> 00:29:37,560
When an angry person on the phone says "Wait there, i'm coming", no matter how the person looks you won't question their appearance

660
00:29:38,280 --> 00:29:44,800
Tsuda is talking to his junior, Rice Sekimachi on the phone

661
00:29:45,510 --> 00:29:53,140
The content is that he's suspicious of Sekimachi as people have been saying bad things about him

662
00:29:53,480 --> 00:29:56,810
What the fuck did you say?

663
00:29:55,230 --> 00:29:56,560
So much anger

664
00:29:56,810 --> 00:29:58,780
Sorry

665
00:29:58,780 --> 00:30:05,490
Other juniors told me you bad-mouthed me. You're disgusting

666
00:30:05,490 --> 00:30:07,960
Is this something that people do?

667
00:30:07,960 --> 00:30:09,930
Sorry, I...

668
00:30:09,930 --> 00:30:13,460
Hey, don't try and apologize your way out of it

669
00:30:12,080 --> 00:30:14,110
Good acting

670
00:30:13,460 --> 00:30:14,100
What happened?

671
00:30:14,100 --> 00:30:15,900
Still with the fucking "what?"

672
00:30:15,900 --> 00:30:18,880
I was so angry when I heard yesterday so I wanted to call you

673
00:30:19,320 --> 00:30:20,880
And then

674
00:30:20,880 --> 00:30:24,340
I'm going over there now, you wait for me there, i'm really fucking angry!

675
00:30:24,980 --> 00:30:26,170
And so,

676
00:30:26,170 --> 00:30:28,610
Tsuda's change in appearance is...

677
00:30:31,490 --> 00:30:32,680
Barefoot

678
00:30:33,360 --> 00:30:34,460
OK

679
00:30:34,520 --> 00:30:36,050
I go barefoot
-Barefoot

680
00:30:36,010 --> 00:30:37,320
Would you realize?

681
00:30:36,050 --> 00:30:37,290
OK

682
00:30:37,290 --> 00:30:42,660
I'll freak out and make him focus on my face

683
00:30:43,580 --> 00:30:48,460
Can he make the other side not ask himself about his current state?

684
00:30:48,460 --> 00:30:49,700
Scary!

685
00:30:48,460 --> 00:30:49,700
What is the result?

686
00:30:49,700 --> 00:30:50,670
Hey, Sekimachi!

687
00:30:50,670 --> 00:30:51,970
Oh, scared the hell out of me

688
00:30:51,970 --> 00:30:52,500
Oi!

689
00:30:52,500 --> 00:30:53,370
Good morning

690
00:30:53,370 --> 00:30:55,200
What's wrong with you?

691
00:30:55,200 --> 00:30:57,510
What did you do?

692
00:30:56,510 --> 00:30:57,700
Realized?

693
00:30:57,510 --> 00:30:58,910
What do you do? I'm asking you a question!

694
00:30:57,700 --> 00:30:58,900
He's looking at the feet

695
00:30:58,910 --> 00:31:01,280
I have been told by my juniors

696
00:31:01,280 --> 00:31:03,140
Who the fuck are you to say that about me?

697
00:31:03,140 --> 00:31:04,500
What are you doing?

698
00:31:04,500 --> 00:31:05,610
You're barefoot?

699
00:31:05,610 --> 00:31:08,020
Being barefoot has nothing to do with it!

700
00:31:10,290 --> 00:31:12,190
So quick!

701
00:31:12,190 --> 00:31:13,190
Instant kill

702
00:31:13,190 --> 00:31:15,550
What are you doing?, you're barefoot?

703
00:31:15,550 --> 00:31:18,290
Being barefoot has nothing to do with it!

704
00:31:18,120 --> 00:31:20,150
He's concerned

705
00:31:18,840 --> 00:31:23,740
So Tsuda was defeated swiftly in just 13 seconds

706
00:31:22,740 --> 00:31:23,750
So quick

707
00:31:23,870 --> 00:31:26,210
The truth is revealed

708
00:31:25,320 --> 00:31:27,330
Kept looking at the feet

709
00:31:28,170 --> 00:31:29,970
Whoa, what?

710
00:31:29,970 --> 00:31:32,210
Really..what the heck!?

711
00:31:32,210 --> 00:31:33,070
Thank you for your hard work

712
00:31:33,070 --> 00:31:35,540
Don't "thank you for your hard work"

713
00:31:35,510 --> 00:31:36,780
He's angry

714
00:31:36,780 --> 00:31:38,210
After all, being scolded...

715
00:31:37,150 --> 00:31:42,740
The project is explained to Sekimachi, who was a bit angry

716
00:31:43,180 --> 00:31:47,060
No... I immediately noticed your bare feet

717
00:31:47,060 --> 00:31:48,220
Too fast

718
00:31:48,220 --> 00:31:51,260
Walking with this "slapslapslap" sound

719
00:31:51,260 --> 00:31:56,800
You didn't think he was too angry to point it out?

720
00:31:56,800 --> 00:31:59,730
I honestly just thought he'd gone insane

721
00:32:00,140 --> 00:32:02,340
What is this?

722
00:32:02,060 --> 00:32:03,240
So dirty

723
00:32:04,810 --> 00:32:07,940
So dirty
-So dirty

724
00:32:08,730 --> 00:32:13,500
Next the top 5 super long theories are revealed

725
00:32:13,500 --> 00:32:16,280
Alone at 5th place is

726
00:32:17,320 --> 00:32:28,060
When asking the age of an old man who is obviously over 80, and you get an impossible answer like "60 years old", you'll still end up saying "you don't look that old"

727
00:32:28,330 --> 00:32:34,780
So, the 89-year-old grandfather, who is surely not 60 years old, appears

728
00:32:36,840 --> 00:32:38,240
How did it turn out?

729
00:32:39,370 --> 00:32:41,600
How old are you?

730
00:32:41,600 --> 00:32:42,840
60

731
00:32:42,840 --> 00:32:45,210
6...60 years old?
-Yes

732
00:32:45,210 --> 00:32:46,710
Ah, but ah...

733
00:32:46,710 --> 00:32:48,910
You look very youthful

734
00:32:50,690 --> 00:32:55,790
In response to the unexpected answer, Ogata replied, "you look very youthful"

735
00:32:56,460 --> 00:33:01,290
Does this mean he looks like more than 50 years old

736
00:33:01,620 --> 00:33:03,830
60 years old?
-Yes

737
00:33:04,130 --> 00:33:06,200
Really?
-Yes

738
00:33:06,200 --> 00:33:09,600
Does anyone ever say "looks like more than that"?

739
00:33:09,600 --> 00:33:10,570
It has been said

740
00:33:10,570 --> 00:33:12,500
Yeah thought so

741
00:33:12,500 --> 00:33:15,740
Is this deliberate...

742
00:33:15,740 --> 00:33:21,780
This is a sweater for people over 60 years old, right?
-Is it?

743
00:33:21,780 --> 00:33:24,510
Is it not?
-No

744
00:33:23,810 --> 00:33:25,830
Already too much

745
00:33:24,850 --> 00:33:25,880
Eh?

746
00:33:26,250 --> 00:33:29,620
60 years old, that's not...

747
00:33:27,640 --> 00:33:28,990
Still talking

748
00:33:29,620 --> 00:33:32,190
Ishibashi Taka and others...

749
00:33:32,490 --> 00:33:35,690
Born in Showa 36

750
00:33:35,690 --> 00:33:38,190
That is, more than...

751
00:33:38,190 --> 00:33:42,130
16 years older than me

752
00:33:42,130 --> 00:33:45,870
Can 16 years older... oh I see...

753
00:33:45,870 --> 00:33:49,040
You're the same age as Tunnels?
-Yes

754
00:33:48,990 --> 00:33:50,120
So persistant!

755
00:33:51,340 --> 00:33:53,440
It can't be...

756
00:33:52,460 --> 00:33:54,690
No other questions at all
-Yeah

757
00:33:54,780 --> 00:33:57,110
Perhaps comedians just look young...

758
00:33:57,860 --> 00:33:59,920
Next at fourth place is

759
00:34:01,390 --> 00:34:14,090
If an old man who suddenly instructed a segment on TV appeared a few days later as a director, his advice would be hastily taken to heart

760
00:34:20,330 --> 00:34:22,420
Next in third place is

761
00:34:23,850 --> 00:34:30,260
This theory introduced at the beginning of the program, with 66 character

762
00:34:32,080 --> 00:34:34,550
Eh? The title is...

763
00:34:34,550 --> 00:34:37,520
Crown program... ah

764
00:34:38,190 --> 00:34:43,740
Next, the second highest number of words theory is

765
00:34:44,490 --> 00:35:01,110
Even if a skit is initially not very funny, if good comedians take over and write a part each, it will eventually become more interesting

766
00:34:59,510 --> 00:35:01,130
It's long
-Really long

767
00:35:01,660 --> 00:35:06,410
By the way, this long theory originates with one of the member's of Knights

768
00:35:07,500 --> 00:35:09,450
So,

769
00:35:09,450 --> 00:35:12,310
Hello
-How are you?

770
00:35:12,310 --> 00:35:16,750
It begins with determining the content and writing the first section

771
00:35:18,190 --> 00:35:22,930
The skit is for a duo

772
00:35:23,070 --> 00:35:26,470
It's about a taxi

773
00:35:26,470 --> 00:35:30,730
After the performance, there's a questionnaire

774
00:35:30,730 --> 00:35:34,740
It says "It's boring" or "same old stuff" or something like that

775
00:35:34,740 --> 00:35:37,350
It's good to get perspective

776
00:35:38,010 --> 00:35:44,350
As the skit that was initially performed live is not all that funny

777
00:35:45,890 --> 00:35:52,100
This time, the setup is changed

778
00:35:53,590 --> 00:35:55,800
The content is...

779
00:35:56,500 --> 00:36:00,500
This is a person who has always had a hard time getting a taxi

780
00:36:00,500 --> 00:36:02,440
The story of trying to stop a car

781
00:36:02,610 --> 00:36:08,710
An idiot is driving a cab, and while driving a cab he's dozing off

782
00:36:08,710 --> 00:36:11,550
The person trying to stop the car says "That's dangerous, is this driver ok?"

783
00:36:11,550 --> 00:36:15,000
Then the cab slams into a wall

784
00:36:15,000 --> 00:36:16,810
Boom, an accident

785
00:36:16,810 --> 00:36:19,690
Then the man comes to the rescue

786
00:36:19,690 --> 00:36:22,560
Saying "Is everything okay?"

787
00:36:22,560 --> 00:36:23,890
"Where are you going?"

788
00:36:23,890 --> 00:36:26,960
"I'm not getting in"

789
00:36:27,530 --> 00:36:33,270
The person selected to take over the next part of the skit is...

790
00:36:33,270 --> 00:36:36,340
Wow...okay

791
00:36:36,540 --> 00:36:40,310
Am I pioneer in segment optimization?
-Yes

792
00:36:40,310 --> 00:36:41,880
Sounds like a nice title...

793
00:36:42,760 --> 00:36:46,930
What's worse is that after reading the beginning of the skit...

794
00:36:48,320 --> 00:36:50,720
It's a bit difficult...

795
00:36:50,950 --> 00:36:52,420
How to deal with the exchange...

796
00:36:53,360 --> 00:36:59,010
And so, with much trouble, he finally manages to complete the second section

797
00:36:59,700 --> 00:37:07,430
Afterwards, a collection of strong members continue the skit

798
00:37:08,740 --> 00:37:11,410
Well, in order to put the whole context together

799
00:37:11,570 --> 00:37:15,250
I did the best I could under the circumstances

800
00:37:16,030 --> 00:37:19,200
The performers of the skit are...

801
00:37:20,260 --> 00:37:21,410
Hello

802
00:37:22,090 --> 00:37:23,820
Kamaitachi

803
00:37:24,350 --> 00:37:26,720
After all, it's been written by famous people

804
00:37:26,720 --> 00:37:29,930
If we can''t make it as funny as they want it to be

805
00:37:29,930 --> 00:37:32,830
We'll get criticized afterwards

806
00:37:32,830 --> 00:37:35,000
It's true, there's a lot of details, the tone and so on

807
00:37:35,470 --> 00:37:37,410
I'm full of anxiety...

808
00:37:38,220 --> 00:37:40,220
And so, two days later

809
00:37:41,020 --> 00:37:45,340
In front of an audience that doesn't know anything, it's finally time to perform the skit

810
00:37:46,290 --> 00:37:49,890
How will the finished product turn out?

811
00:37:50,460 --> 00:37:52,280
Something has to happen

812
00:37:52,280 --> 00:37:56,120
There's a worry that maybe the next person won't be able to continue it on

813
00:37:56,120 --> 00:37:58,020
Super hard

814
00:37:58,230 --> 00:37:59,960
It has to become more interesting

815
00:37:59,960 --> 00:38:02,830
It becomes the thing that each person themselves likes

816
00:38:07,910 --> 00:38:11,180
It's so hard to get a cab

817
00:38:14,140 --> 00:38:16,780
Ah finally a taxi came, Taxi ~

818
00:38:18,690 --> 00:38:19,930
What's wrong with that car?

819
00:38:20,940 --> 00:38:23,280
The driver is asleep, right?

820
00:38:23,680 --> 00:38:25,340
Ah, it's dangerous

821
00:38:25,340 --> 00:38:26,170
Watch out!

822
00:38:27,530 --> 00:38:29,910
Watch out, it's going to hit the wall!

823
00:38:31,950 --> 00:38:33,050
Ah, an accident!

824
00:38:34,880 --> 00:38:36,470
It completely became an accident

825
00:38:39,090 --> 00:38:40,220
Is he okay?

826
00:38:40,220 --> 00:38:41,060
Where are you going?

827
00:38:41,060 --> 00:38:42,010
I'm not getting in!

828
00:38:42,870 --> 00:38:44,810
I can't be a passenger, right?

829
00:38:46,160 --> 00:38:47,100
The airbag is so slow...

830
00:38:49,470 --> 00:38:51,830
You scared me
-You're similarly slow to react

831
00:38:51,990 --> 00:38:55,800
Wow, this is bad. It's peak traffic time!

832
00:38:56,340 --> 00:38:58,470
Can this go back in?

833
00:38:58,470 --> 00:38:59,410
Eh?

834
00:38:59,620 --> 00:39:03,220
The airbag, can it be stuffed back in?

835
00:39:03,220 --> 00:39:06,600
Uh, I think they're mostly single-use

836
00:39:06,600 --> 00:39:10,120
Ah, damn it, I wanted to drive a little longer

837
00:39:10,120 --> 00:39:12,440
But the car is finished...

838
00:39:12,440 --> 00:39:14,050
The front is flattened

839
00:39:14,050 --> 00:39:15,080
Eh?

840
00:39:15,080 --> 00:39:16,910
You're not injured or anything?

841
00:39:16,910 --> 00:39:17,840
No i'm fine

842
00:39:18,920 --> 00:39:19,570
Eh?

843
00:39:20,350 --> 00:39:22,010
What's wrong?

844
00:39:22,010 --> 00:39:23,820
I can't get out

845
00:39:23,820 --> 00:39:24,670
Eh?

846
00:39:24,670 --> 00:39:25,760
I'm stuck

847
00:39:25,760 --> 00:39:27,210
Are you okay?

848
00:39:27,210 --> 00:39:27,970
Eh?

849
00:39:29,610 --> 00:39:30,450
Ah, i'm out

850
00:39:30,450 --> 00:39:31,930
What's up with you?

851
00:39:32,440 --> 00:39:35,710
Wow, seriously!? It's flattened

852
00:39:35,710 --> 00:39:37,850
Why are you laughing?

853
00:39:37,850 --> 00:39:40,810
Wow, this...

854
00:39:40,810 --> 00:39:41,610
That stinks!

855
00:39:44,260 --> 00:39:45,640
Did you shit yourself?

856
00:39:47,010 --> 00:39:53,370
Ah, I have the vague memory of needing to go to the toilet before the accident happened

857
00:39:53,370 --> 00:39:56,480
The impact of the accident forced it out?

858
00:40:01,560 --> 00:40:03,220
Ha ha ha ha

859
00:40:03,220 --> 00:40:05,720
That's it coming out, right?

860
00:40:05,720 --> 00:40:09,500
I got out, this got out too

861
00:40:10,000 --> 00:40:11,910
It's no laughing matter

862
00:40:13,230 --> 00:40:13,900
Huh?

863
00:40:16,860 --> 00:40:18,320
Ah, cat!

864
00:40:18,320 --> 00:40:19,790
Ah, there's a cat!

865
00:40:20,680 --> 00:40:23,140
What's up? Lonely?

866
00:40:23,140 --> 00:40:24,590
No, it's stuck

867
00:40:25,750 --> 00:40:28,360
It's completely stuck inside

868
00:40:33,640 --> 00:40:34,970
What is it?

869
00:40:34,970 --> 00:40:40,880
There are so many problems that I don't know where to start

870
00:40:42,130 --> 00:40:43,320
Okay, let's start with the cat

871
00:40:43,320 --> 00:40:44,470
It's poop, isn't it?

872
00:40:45,700 --> 00:40:46,600
First

873
00:40:46,600 --> 00:40:47,940
Calling the police is the right thing to do

874
00:40:47,940 --> 00:40:49,620
Suddenly normal words came out

875
00:40:50,310 --> 00:40:51,500
That's true

876
00:40:54,160 --> 00:40:57,080
I'm in Akasaka 5-chome, I shit my pants

877
00:40:57,080 --> 00:40:58,910
What's the use of this report?

878
00:41:00,410 --> 00:41:01,470
Seems like they won't come

879
00:41:01,470 --> 00:41:02,650
Of course

880
00:41:03,150 --> 00:41:05,660
Eh... can you put this back?

881
00:41:05,660 --> 00:41:06,750
What?

882
00:41:06,750 --> 00:41:07,430
This!

883
00:41:07,430 --> 00:41:08,820
How can you put that back

884
00:41:08,820 --> 00:41:12,050
It's not good to improperly report the accident!

885
00:41:12,050 --> 00:41:14,130
But how should I say it?

886
00:41:14,130 --> 00:41:15,760
Just report the facts, right?

887
00:41:15,760 --> 00:41:21,130
This statement is a bit difficult to make for the person involved in the accident itself

888
00:41:21,130 --> 00:41:24,800
There's a cat.. can it be called a meow body accident

889
00:41:24,800 --> 00:41:26,170
It'll be seen as bullshit

890
00:41:26,170 --> 00:41:30,650
Combine that with the fact that I pooped in my pants

891
00:41:30,650 --> 00:41:33,860
Could it be called a human fecal accident?
-Don't call it that

892
00:41:33,860 --> 00:41:37,340
Don't get hung up on what to say exactly, just call them back

893
00:41:37,340 --> 00:41:38,280
Eh?

894
00:41:38,280 --> 00:41:40,280
People are starting to gather

895
00:41:41,760 --> 00:41:42,470
What?

896
00:41:43,120 --> 00:41:45,030
Someone wants to be picked up

897
00:41:45,030 --> 00:41:48,010
Sorry, I can't take passengers now

898
00:41:48,010 --> 00:41:49,640
A strange guy!

899
00:41:49,640 --> 00:41:52,420
A strange guy on the same wavelength as this guy

900
00:41:53,310 --> 00:41:56,240
Meow body accident? That's right

901
00:41:57,130 --> 00:41:59,300
Human fecal accident? Yes certainly

902
00:41:59,300 --> 00:42:02,090
Is this a pre-existing term? Am I the only one who doesn't know of it?

903
00:42:02,090 --> 00:42:04,470
So it's impossible to carry passengers

904
00:42:04,470 --> 00:42:07,170
No passengers after an accident

905
00:42:07,170 --> 00:42:09,490
Eh? You're saying the car is empty?

906
00:42:09,490 --> 00:42:12,080
As I said, an accident has happened

907
00:42:12,080 --> 00:42:14,690
Eh? You're saying the anus is also empty?

908
00:42:14,690 --> 00:42:18,130
No, it's something I can decide, maybe I can put it back

909
00:42:18,130 --> 00:42:20,300
Weirdoes and weirdoes have become tangled

910
00:42:20,300 --> 00:42:23,610
Weirdoes and weirdoes are fightings over a weird thing

911
00:42:23,610 --> 00:42:25,320
What the hell is this situation?

912
00:42:25,710 --> 00:42:26,640
Ah, are the police here?

913
00:42:26,640 --> 00:42:30,330
Wait a minute. Here it comes. It's great

914
00:42:30,330 --> 00:42:32,060
Huh? Words?

915
00:42:32,060 --> 00:42:36,170
Weirdoes and weirdoes have become tangled

916
00:42:36,170 --> 00:42:39,970
Weirdoes and weirdoes are fightings over a weird thing

917
00:42:39,310 --> 00:42:40,290
Akiyama wrote this, right?

918
00:42:40,260 --> 00:42:41,890
Strange people and strange...

919
00:42:40,290 --> 00:42:41,550
Akiyama's part

920
00:42:41,890 --> 00:42:44,390
Wait a minute. Hey, what's going on?

921
00:42:45,060 --> 00:42:48,080
My name is Riverbank Ghost Light

922
00:42:48,080 --> 00:42:49,980
Riverbank Ghost Light？

923
00:42:48,510 --> 00:42:50,510
It's definitely Akiyama's work

924
00:42:50,190 --> 00:42:53,840
Not in this form, but i've worked as a singer previously

925
00:42:53,840 --> 00:42:55,070
What happened all of a sudden?

926
00:42:55,810 --> 00:42:59,590
But Riverbank Ghost Light has not yet debuted

927
00:42:59,590 --> 00:43:02,890
So i'm working hard as a driver to support my dream

928
00:43:02,890 --> 00:43:04,490
You are developing too fast

929
00:43:04,780 --> 00:43:08,400
Let me tell you what you said before

930
00:43:08,400 --> 00:43:11,330
Weirdoes and weirdoes have become tangled

931
00:43:11,330 --> 00:43:14,940
Weirdoes and weirdoes are fightings over a weird thing

932
00:43:14,940 --> 00:43:17,280
This is the first time I have encountered such a resonant words

933
00:43:17,280 --> 00:43:18,890
These are not lyrics

934
00:43:19,070 --> 00:43:21,240
This encounter with you must also be fate

935
00:43:21,240 --> 00:43:22,260
No, it's not

936
00:43:22,260 --> 00:43:23,750
Let's sing together

937
00:43:23,750 --> 00:43:24,870
Sing what?

938
00:43:24,870 --> 00:43:26,820
Sing this situation out

939
00:43:26,820 --> 00:43:28,580
No, it's too embarrassing

940
00:43:29,190 --> 00:43:32,270
Weirdoes and weirdoes have become tangled

941
00:43:32,740 --> 00:43:36,150
Weirdoes and weirdoes are fightings over a weird thing

942
00:43:36,150 --> 00:43:38,430
Whose fault is it that it turned out this way?

943
00:43:38,430 --> 00:43:40,880
The fault of the cat? Shit's fault?

944
00:43:42,070 --> 00:43:44,390
It's your fault for driving tired

945
00:43:44,590 --> 00:43:47,890
Yes, it's my fault for driving tired

946
00:43:47,890 --> 00:43:49,860
Meow body or human feces or

947
00:43:49,860 --> 00:43:51,910
This idiot or that idiot or

948
00:43:51,910 --> 00:43:58,730
All are ~ because of ~ driving ~ tired ~

949
00:43:59,200 --> 00:44:01,440
Please do not drive tired

950
00:44:03,900 --> 00:44:05,230
No one's laughing

951
00:44:05,230 --> 00:44:07,830
I guess it's better to broadcast an educational video as usual

952
00:44:07,830 --> 00:44:10,380
No, live performances like this makes people happy the most

953
00:44:10,380 --> 00:44:14,930
But they're not here to have fun, they're just here to renew their driver's licenses

954
00:44:14,930 --> 00:44:18,940
Fine, let's start from the beginning again before the afternoon traffic rules study

955
00:44:19,700 --> 00:44:21,780
Let's go
-What a pain

956
00:44:24,750 --> 00:44:26,970
Wrapped up with foolishness

957
00:44:26,040 --> 00:44:28,340
Thank you for your hard work

958
00:44:28,780 --> 00:44:31,610
I'm a little confused...

959
00:44:31,610 --> 00:44:34,820
Wasn't that really unfunny?

960
00:44:34,820 --> 00:44:37,690
When reading the script, because we know the people that wrote it

961
00:44:37,690 --> 00:44:41,330
In our minds, we could see the person talking, the person making jokes

962
00:44:41,560 --> 00:44:45,000
It gave the feeling of "so interesting" and "so funny", but the result...

963
00:44:45,000 --> 00:44:46,840
It's amazing how it all came together...

964
00:44:47,040 --> 00:44:50,300
Well...I don't know if it's right to say so

965
00:44:50,300 --> 00:44:53,210
From the beginning of Akiyama's section, it became really unfunny, right?

966
00:44:53,210 --> 00:44:56,850
If Akiyama had performed it, it would have been funnier...

967
00:44:57,050 --> 00:44:59,750
We practiced many times

968
00:44:59,920 --> 00:45:02,460
More rehearsals than for the M-1 competition

969
00:45:03,020 --> 00:45:05,050
It's impossible
-Impossible

970
00:45:05,740 --> 00:45:12,700
Lastly, the number one ranking for the longest theory name is

971
00:45:13,470 --> 00:45:29,140
Using a street-based sticker form of voting of who you'd rather sleep with, if singer Tortai Bukuro has 99 votes and Masaharu Fukuyama has 0 votes, the state of the possibility of going with Bukuro will increase

972
00:45:29,970 --> 00:45:34,880
The winner clocks in at 75 characters

973
00:45:36,180 --> 00:45:41,020
The above is the final ranking of the longest theory names

974
00:45:43,220 --> 00:46:14,750
