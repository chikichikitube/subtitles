00:00:00,490 --> 00:00:02,330
Hello everybody

2
00:00:02,330 --> 00:00:04,720
Matsumoto-san, why are we here today?

3
00:00:04,720 --> 00:00:10,490
Well, we visited Murakami Joji's home last time   -Yes

4
00:00:10,490 --> 00:00:13,630
And that episode received many bad reviews

5
00:00:13,630 --> 00:00:14,970
Don't do it again then

6
00:00:14,970 --> 00:00:18,440
However, doing it again disregard of bad reviews, is the style of this show

7
00:00:18,440 --> 00:00:22,200
Today, we invited someone that we thought it's impossible for him to accept the offer

8
00:00:22,200 --> 00:00:25,340
Maybe he wants to advertise his drama, I think?

9
00:00:25,340 --> 00:00:27,840
So that's why he accepted, or else it would be impossible

10
00:00:27,840 --> 00:00:32,040
But then we thought, having big guests
is not the style of this show too, so...

11
00:00:32,040 --> 00:00:35,030
Today's guest will be Jimmy Onishi instead

12
00:00:35,030 --> 00:00:36,980
That dude is always available!!

13
00:00:36,980 --> 00:00:41,350
Not always though, it can't be always

14
00:00:41,350 --> 00:00:43,920
So it's the same as last time, right?   -Yes

15
00:00:41,710 --> 00:00:51,980
The Gaki members prepared many items in the home to be visited
The guests need to introduce the items as if they own that item

16
00:00:43,920 --> 00:00:47,110
We'll see how he reacts to the items that we've prepared

17
00:00:47,110 --> 00:00:49,700
And of course, he has no idea what's inside

18
00:00:49,700 --> 00:00:52,030
So it will be improvised

19
00:00:52,030 --> 00:00:55,240
Which heavily depends on your sense of humor

20
00:00:55,240 --> 00:00:58,270
So let's start the home visit   -Let's go

21
00:00:58,270 --> 00:01:06,210
Subbed by Appieopie, more episodes at
www.laughseejapan.com/user/18797

22
00:01:06,210 --> 00:01:08,700
There he is

23
00:01:08,700 --> 00:01:11,420
Wearing clothes that are far from colorful

24
00:01:11,420 --> 00:01:14,160
That's too monotone

25
00:01:14,780 --> 00:01:17,050
Good morning   -Good morning

26
00:01:17,050 --> 00:01:19,470
Your home is so big   -Looks really good

27
00:01:19,470 --> 00:01:22,190
Well...actually...someone gave it to me

28
00:01:22,190 --> 00:01:23,540
Gave it to you?

29
00:01:23,540 --> 00:01:24,800
Is it possible to give out homes?

30
00:01:24,800 --> 00:01:29,350
Umm...from my uncle

31
00:01:29,880 --> 00:01:31,150
So big

32
00:01:32,910 --> 00:01:34,870
You gained weight, huh?!

33
00:01:34,870 --> 00:01:37,140
Max 20 kg

34
00:01:37,140 --> 00:01:38,670
You look so big   -Yeah, he looks fat

35
00:01:38,670 --> 00:01:41,350
He definitely gained a lot of weight

36
00:01:41,350 --> 00:01:44,740
You look completely black now, everything

37
00:01:44,740 --> 00:01:46,210
His skin is so dry too

38
00:01:46,210 --> 00:01:48,390
And your face is so dirty too, dude!!

39
00:01:48,390 --> 00:01:50,620
You're so loud

40
00:01:50,620 --> 00:01:51,830
Ma..ma..ma...

41
00:01:51,830 --> 00:01:54,880
This kind of face should never appear on tv!!

42
00:01:54,880 --> 00:01:59,640
It's because of wearing masks   -His skin looks so dry

43
00:01:59,640 --> 00:02:03,870
-Oh, because we're always wearing masks
-But still, his skin looks too dry

44
00:02:03,870 --> 00:02:05,610
Look, the house name plate says Onishi

45
00:02:05,610 --> 00:02:07,510
Yeah, that's his real name

46
00:02:07,230 --> 00:02:12,890
Gimmick (1)
Graffiti on house name plate

47
00:02:07,230 --> 00:02:12,890
He stinks

48
00:02:07,230 --> 00:02:12,890
Retarded

49
00:02:07,230 --> 00:02:12,890
This dude is so stupid (ww)

50
00:02:07,230 --> 00:02:12,890
You boring piece of shit! Move away!!

51
00:02:07,510 --> 00:02:09,600
But something else is written on it

52
00:02:09,600 --> 00:02:12,820
Yeah, they always play pranks on me

53
00:02:12,820 --> 00:02:14,820
You're not angry about this?

54
00:02:14,820 --> 00:02:19,490
Well, even if I erase it, they'll just write it again

55
00:02:19,490 --> 00:02:21,760
It goes on forever, so just leave it like that

56
00:02:21,760 --> 00:02:27,160
-Can we enter your home now?   -Yeah sure, welcome to my home

57
00:02:27,160 --> 00:02:28,600
First time ever

58
00:02:28,600 --> 00:02:31,410
There's even a little garden here   -Incredible

59
00:02:31,410 --> 00:02:32,850
Your dog is not here?

60
00:02:32,850 --> 00:02:35,500
Oh...my dog is...umm...

61
00:02:34,320 --> 00:02:38,640
Gimmick (2)
Empty dog house

62
00:02:35,780 --> 00:02:38,590
My dog is at the pet shop now

63
00:02:38,590 --> 00:02:40,480
How come?

64
00:02:40,480 --> 00:02:45,110
Well, guests are coming today, and it's inappropriate if the mic pick up it's voice

65
00:02:45,110 --> 00:02:46,150
What breed is your dog?

66
00:02:46,150 --> 00:02:51,490
Well...the breed is...umm...pit bull   -Pit bull?

67
00:02:51,490 --> 00:02:55,110
It looks like this...   -Oh, really?

68
00:02:55,110 --> 00:02:58,840
It looks more like a frog though

69
00:02:58,840 --> 00:03:01,070
I see, so it's called a pit bull

70
00:03:01,070 --> 00:03:02,630
Is it a large dog?

71
00:03:02,630 --> 00:03:05,060
Well, probably medium sized dog

72
00:03:05,060 --> 00:03:06,120
Can we go inside now?

73
00:03:06,120 --> 00:03:10,110
Yeah sure, let's go inside

74
00:03:10,110 --> 00:03:12,970
I really want to meet pit bull   -Yeah, exactly

75
00:03:14,210 --> 00:03:18,490
Wow, it can even open on this side?   -This is amazing

76
00:03:18,490 --> 00:03:20,420
Excuse me   -Welcome to my home

77
00:03:20,420 --> 00:03:22,420
Wow, these shoes are neatly arranged...huh?

78
00:03:22,420 --> 00:03:24,850
What's written on it?

79
00:03:24,850 --> 00:03:26,680
It says "right" and "left"

80
00:03:26,870 --> 00:03:31,600
Gimmick (3)
Shoes with "left" and "right written on it

81
00:03:27,570 --> 00:03:31,510
Well, right, left, right, left, right, left

82
00:03:31,800 --> 00:03:34,290
It's kind of like one, two, one, two

83
00:03:35,610 --> 00:03:37,110
Eh? What do you mean?

84
00:03:37,230 --> 00:03:39,630
Because I want to wear those shoes properly

85
00:03:39,630 --> 00:03:41,770
Or else, it's gonna be embarrassing, right?

86
00:03:42,500 --> 00:03:45,240
So I have to wear it properly

87
00:03:45,240 --> 00:03:49,000
-Or else, it looks awkward if I wear it like this, right?
-Oh, so wearing the shoes on the wrong feet

88
00:03:49,000 --> 00:03:51,790
Or maybe wearing right shoes on both legs, or the other way round

89
00:03:51,790 --> 00:03:54,500
So these things happen if you don't label it clearly?

90
00:03:54,500 --> 00:04:00,170
Sometimes, I trip on my own feet

91
00:04:00,170 --> 00:04:02,540
And I wonder why these things happen

92
00:04:02,540 --> 00:04:05,770
Then I found out I confused left and right

93
00:04:05,770 --> 00:04:07,100
So these things really happen...

94
00:04:07,100 --> 00:04:08,840
So you won't get it wrong if you label it?

95
00:04:08,840 --> 00:04:11,560
Yeah, I can walk steadily now

96
00:04:14,260 --> 00:04:17,230
What happened?   -What are you laughing at?

97
00:04:17,230 --> 00:04:22,220
It's all Hamada-kun's fault   -Huh?

98
00:04:22,220 --> 00:04:24,240
What the heck are you talking about?

99
00:04:24,240 --> 00:04:27,410
He's breathing heavily   -What are you talking about?

100
00:04:27,410 --> 00:04:30,650
He's breathing so heavily   -It's all Hamada-kun's fault

101
00:04:30,650 --> 00:04:33,950
Anyway, so you won't get it wrong anymore with these labels

102
00:04:33,950 --> 00:04:37,890
This is something unique about Jimmy-chan

103
00:04:38,610 --> 00:04:41,120
Wait a moment, this is unacceptable!

104
00:04:44,490 --> 00:04:46,600
Come on, Jimmy-chan

105
00:04:44,980 --> 00:04:51,600
Gimmick (4)
Pushpins on Hamada's face

106
00:04:46,600 --> 00:04:48,460
This is completely unacceptable

107
00:04:49,590 --> 00:04:51,800
Why are there pushpins on my face?

108
00:04:51,800 --> 00:04:55,660
-Because that's the only place to put those pushpins
-No way, dude, that's not true

109
00:04:55,660 --> 00:04:59,910
There's pushpins at the four corners already

110
00:04:59,910 --> 00:05:02,210
Why did you do this?

111
00:05:02,210 --> 00:05:06,620
Because I can't help but to laugh whenever I see Hamada-kun's face

112
00:05:06,620 --> 00:05:08,430
What are you talking about?

113
00:05:08,430 --> 00:05:10,120
He's pissing me out   -Because...

114
00:05:10,120 --> 00:05:13,890
Because only Hamada is wearing the Kappa wig

115
00:05:13,890 --> 00:05:17,360
I'm so sorry for doing this   -It's okay

116
00:05:17,360 --> 00:05:21,740
-He's probably bearing a grudge though
-Yeah, there's many other solutions

117
00:05:21,740 --> 00:05:24,100
Anyway, please show us around your home

118
00:05:24,100 --> 00:05:26,480
Excuse me   -Which room is this?

119
00:05:26,480 --> 00:05:30,880
This is the kitchen   -Kitchen?

120
00:05:33,890 --> 00:05:36,650
There's a home altar   -Yes

121
00:05:36,650 --> 00:05:39,730
You're very devout   -Yes

122
00:05:36,960 --> 00:05:41,930
*Manma-chan is the mascot in Sanma's show

123
00:05:36,960 --> 00:05:41,930
Gimmick (5)
A home altar with Manma-chan

124
00:05:39,730 --> 00:05:42,000
But why did you put Manma-chan there?

125
00:05:42,000 --> 00:05:48,220
The Amaterasu-Mikonokami   -Mikonokami?

126
00:05:42,000 --> 00:05:51,430
*Should be Amaterasu Omikami, the god of the Sun, however Jimmy said Amaterasu Mikonokami instead, which means the god of the son

127
00:05:48,220 --> 00:05:51,430
Mikonokami?   -Yes, the Amaterasu-Mikonokami...

128
00:05:51,430 --> 00:05:54,880
It's the sa...sa...sacred tree

129
00:05:54,880 --> 00:05:59,410
*Sacred tree (Goshin-boku) and body of governing god (Goshin-tai) have similar pronunciations

130
00:05:54,880 --> 00:05:59,410
-A Tree? That's not a tree!
-Do you mean the body of governing god?

131
00:05:59,410 --> 00:06:02,580
I'm asking you, why did you put the Manma doll over there?

132
00:06:02,580 --> 00:06:03,570
Well...umm...

133
00:06:03,570 --> 00:06:06,810
Either way, it's definitely not a sacred tree

134
00:06:06,810 --> 00:06:10,530
But why?   -Why did you put Manma-chan there?

135
00:06:10,530 --> 00:06:13,030
Because I like Manma-chan so much

136
00:06:13,030 --> 00:06:15,760
As a God

137
00:06:15,760 --> 00:06:18,290
You like it as a God?

138
00:06:18,290 --> 00:06:25,120
Amaterasu?   -Amaterasu-Mikonokami...

139
00:06:26,960 --> 00:06:31,010
-And worshiping it as a sacred tree?
-Yes, as a sacred tree

140
00:06:31,010 --> 00:06:33,740
I told you it's not a tree

141
00:06:33,740 --> 00:06:36,700
What about the poster behind Yama-chan?

142
00:06:36,240 --> 00:06:41,130
Gimmick (6)
Poster of Hayami Yu

143
00:06:36,990 --> 00:06:40,780
Oh, she's my favorite girl, Hayami Yu

144
00:06:41,270 --> 00:06:45,270
We saw the same thing in Jouji-san home   -Yeah

145
00:06:45,270 --> 00:06:48,250
Not the same poster though. Are you two of the same generation?

146
00:06:48,250 --> 00:06:49,740
Yes, we are   -You still like her now?

147
00:06:49,740 --> 00:06:52,030
Yes, she's still my favourite girl

148
00:06:52,030 --> 00:06:57,800
I've entered the entertainment industry, just to become Hayami Yu's disciple

149
00:06:57,800 --> 00:06:59,560
You want to become her disciple?

150
00:06:59,560 --> 00:07:01,560
She's younger than you though

151
00:07:01,560 --> 00:07:04,810
Yes, I want to become Hayami Yu's disciple, that's why I've entered the entertainment industry

152
00:07:04,810 --> 00:07:07,940
No way, dude, I said you're older than her

153
00:07:07,940 --> 00:07:08,970
You want become her disciple?

154
00:07:08,970 --> 00:07:12,610
Yes, when I first saw her singing "kore janai" during high school

155
00:07:12,610 --> 00:07:14,470
I've decided to become this girl's disciple

156
00:07:14,470 --> 00:07:16,180
Why would you want to become her disciple?

157
00:07:16,180 --> 00:07:19,860
I understand that you want to get closer with her, but...

158
00:07:19,860 --> 00:07:21,100
You want to become her disciple?

159
00:07:21,100 --> 00:07:23,660
Hey, what's this?

160
00:07:23,330 --> 00:07:27,640
Gimmick (7)
A whole lot of fireworks

161
00:07:23,660 --> 00:07:25,950
Eh? That's so scary

162
00:07:25,950 --> 00:07:28,810
This is for...you know...

163
00:07:28,810 --> 00:07:30,570
Yakitori (grilled chicken skewers)

164
00:07:30,570 --> 00:07:35,340
Thread the chicken onto skewers, and eat it like this

165
00:07:35,340 --> 00:07:36,570
So it's a skewer?   -Yes, skewer

166
00:07:36,570 --> 00:07:39,990
No way, those are fireworks, right?

167
00:07:39,990 --> 00:07:42,320
Jimmy-san, those are fireworks

168
00:07:42,320 --> 00:07:45,620
Umm...well...these are actually fireworks

169
00:07:45,620 --> 00:07:46,200
Umm...

170
00:07:46,200 --> 00:07:49,250
But the fireworks are facing this way, how come?

171
00:07:49,250 --> 00:07:51,220
Yeah, it's facing the house on the other side

172
00:07:51,220 --> 00:07:55,980
This is because...sometimes...intruder enters from here

173
00:07:55,980 --> 00:07:59,360
No way, the fireworks are definitely aiming at the house over there

174
00:07:59,520 --> 00:08:05,960
Well...actually...whenever I beat the futon, they're always complaining

175
00:08:05,960 --> 00:08:09,330
So there's a neighborhood dispute

176
00:08:09,330 --> 00:08:12,050
But he's being mean too

177
00:08:12,050 --> 00:08:14,470
This is inappropriate too

178
00:08:14,470 --> 00:08:18,100
Well, these things just happen

179
00:08:19,190 --> 00:08:21,480
What's this? Look at this, Matsumoto-san

180
00:08:21,480 --> 00:08:23,270
What the heck is this?

181
00:08:24,790 --> 00:08:28,510
Sake?   -But the thing inside, it has to be bra

182
00:08:28,040 --> 00:08:34,490
Gimmick (8)
Bra soaked in sake

183
00:08:28,510 --> 00:08:31,440
Well...bra...

184
00:08:31,440 --> 00:08:32,720
You're soaking bra in Sake?

185
00:08:32,720 --> 00:08:37,550
Well...yeah...I'm soaking girl's bra in Sake

186
00:08:37,550 --> 00:08:39,140
Why?   -That's ridiculous

187
00:08:39,140 --> 00:08:41,070
Why are you soaking it?

188
00:08:41,070 --> 00:08:43,070
Well...umm...

189
00:08:43,070 --> 00:08:48,240
The smelly fluid of girls   -Fluid?

190
00:08:48,240 --> 00:08:50,460
Body odor

191
00:08:50,460 --> 00:08:52,820
Of girls?

192
00:08:52,820 --> 00:08:55,870
What are you soaking it in though?

193
00:08:55,870 --> 00:08:57,950
It's Umeshu (Sake with plums)

194
00:08:57,950 --> 00:09:00,160
Umeshu?   -I see

195
00:09:00,160 --> 00:09:01,430
It tastes really good

196
00:09:01,430 --> 00:09:03,620
Eh? You drink it?

197
00:09:03,620 --> 00:09:05,260
Of course I drink it

198
00:09:05,260 --> 00:09:05,970
It's delicious

199
00:09:05,970 --> 00:09:07,420
So it's a Bra-Sake

200
00:09:07,420 --> 00:09:11,700
Yes, Bra-Sake, with the good smell of girls

201
00:09:11,700 --> 00:09:13,700
Who's bra is it for the one at the rightmost side?

202
00:09:13,700 --> 00:09:18,000
Yeah, who's bra is it? Do you remember?

203
00:09:18,000 --> 00:09:20,280
This is Saeko-chan

204
00:09:20,280 --> 00:09:22,110
Who's that?

205
00:09:22,110 --> 00:09:25,630
We did...a play

206
00:09:25,630 --> 00:09:30,990
An underwear play, and she gave me her bra

207
00:09:30,990 --> 00:09:35,550
You got her bra during the play?

208
00:09:35,550 --> 00:09:37,980
She bit the shoulder strap like this

209
00:09:37,980 --> 00:09:41,670
Bit it?

210
00:09:41,670 --> 00:09:43,040
Bit the shoulder strap?

211
00:09:43,040 --> 00:09:45,880
Yes, she bit the should strap and dragged it like this

212
00:09:45,880 --> 00:09:48,040
Oh, I see, so that's the play   -Yes

213
00:09:48,040 --> 00:09:49,700
What about this one?

214
00:09:49,700 --> 00:09:55,480
This is Hurukawa Ruri-san

215
00:09:55,480 --> 00:09:57,230
And what about this one?

216
00:09:57,230 --> 00:10:03,270
This one is Hujimoto Rumi-chan

217
00:10:03,270 --> 00:10:04,700
And what about this one?

218
00:10:04,700 --> 00:10:06,750
Eh...this is Shizuka-chan

219
00:10:06,750 --> 00:10:09,380
You omitted her last name*

220
00:10:06,750 --> 00:10:16,110
*Matsumoto mentioned last name (Ue) and Jimmy made up the name Ue-kawa

221
00:10:09,380 --> 00:10:12,790
Uekawa Hujika-chan

222
00:10:12,790 --> 00:10:16,110
You're just inspired by my "Ue"

223
00:10:16,380 --> 00:10:18,250
Then what about the last one?

224
00:10:18,250 --> 00:10:20,500
It's a black one

225
00:10:21,310 --> 00:10:26,160
Umm...Meisa-chan

226
00:10:26,160 --> 00:10:30,350
*Black is pronounced as Kuro, so Jimmy just think of Kuro-ki Meisa, a famous actress

227
00:10:26,160 --> 00:10:30,350
You're definitely just inspired by "black"

228
00:10:30,350 --> 00:10:33,380
Okay, I see

229
00:10:33,380 --> 00:10:37,650
Let's take a look at other places   -Yes, sure

230
00:10:40,090 --> 00:10:42,010
The bathroom

231
00:10:42,010 --> 00:10:44,450
Huh?

232
00:10:44,450 --> 00:10:46,090
Can this be aired?

233
00:10:49,100 --> 00:10:54,300
Gimmick (9)
Konjacs with a hole in the middle

234
00:10:49,310 --> 00:10:51,810
Look at this   -What have you been doing?

235
00:10:56,390 --> 00:10:59,180
There's a hole in the middle of the konjac

236
00:10:59,180 --> 00:11:01,000
You're still doing this in this age?

237
00:11:01,000 --> 00:11:03,640
Yeah, sometimes...3 times per week

238
00:11:03,640 --> 00:11:06,000
That's unbelievable   -3 times per week

239
00:11:06,000 --> 00:11:15,050
If you don't use it frequently, you'll lose your sexiness

240
00:11:15,050 --> 00:11:17,830
Is it relevant to sexiness?   -Absolutely

241
00:11:19,340 --> 00:11:22,250
Tanaka, look at those things on the floor

242
00:11:22,250 --> 00:11:24,140
Wait a second...this is...eh?

243
00:11:24,140 --> 00:11:27,080
This is for that, right?   -Yes

244
00:11:24,340 --> 00:11:30,300
Gimmick (10)
A whole lot of paper underwear

245
00:11:27,080 --> 00:11:31,360
You wear it when you get a massage, right?   -Yes

246
00:11:31,360 --> 00:11:32,280
There's so many of them

247
00:11:32,280 --> 00:11:35,580
For example, when you go on a date with a girl

248
00:11:35,580 --> 00:11:40,100
I'll wear this and show it to the girl

249
00:11:40,740 --> 00:11:44,600
What are you talking about?   -I have no idea

250
00:11:44,600 --> 00:11:48,650
Show it to girls? What do you mean?

251
00:11:48,650 --> 00:11:51,940
Well, this is my tactic to approach a girl

252
00:11:51,940 --> 00:11:54,850
You're using this tactic to approach girls?   -Yes

253
00:11:55,320 --> 00:11:57,650
Why are you storing so many of them at your home though?

254
00:11:57,650 --> 00:11:59,890
Because I sometimes ask them to come over to my place

255
00:11:59,890 --> 00:12:01,450
Oh, to your home?   -Yes

256
00:12:03,420 --> 00:12:06,100
So you're using it at home too

257
00:12:06,100 --> 00:12:09,040
What about inside the shower room, Tanaka?

258
00:12:10,290 --> 00:12:12,510
Huh? What's going on here?

259
00:12:13,910 --> 00:12:16,450
Someone is sitting inside

260
00:12:14,600 --> 00:12:18,190
Gimmick (10)
The body scrub aunties

261
00:12:16,890 --> 00:12:18,680
The body scrub auntie...

262
00:12:24,500 --> 00:12:28,690
Yeah, she's always here to give me a body scrub

263
00:12:28,690 --> 00:12:31,120
She's always here?

264
00:12:31,120 --> 00:12:33,080
The body scrub auntie is always stationed here?

265
00:12:33,080 --> 00:12:34,650
Yes, always stationed here...

266
00:12:34,650 --> 00:12:38,030
Therefore my back has almost been destroyed

267
00:12:38,030 --> 00:12:43,580
-That's going too far   -Let her go!!

268
00:12:43,580 --> 00:12:45,880
So you're wearing this underwear when she scrubs your back?   -Yes, exactly

269
00:12:45,880 --> 00:12:48,400
Of course, that's my tactic to approach the auntie

270
00:12:48,400 --> 00:12:48,800
Okay, I see

271
00:12:48,800 --> 00:12:51,730
You're trying to approach the auntie with these tactics at home?

272
00:12:52,670 --> 00:12:58,510
Yes, only approach, it's not allowed to touch her

273
00:12:58,510 --> 00:13:01,890
You're not allowed to touch someone who is always stationed here?

274
00:13:01,890 --> 00:13:05,860
No way, this is my rules, my system

275
00:13:05,860 --> 00:13:07,820
That kind of behavior is intolerable

276
00:13:07,820 --> 00:13:09,610
What about here?

277
00:13:09,610 --> 00:13:13,570
Oh, it's the toilet

278
00:13:13,570 --> 00:13:14,970
Yama-chan   -Yes

279
00:13:16,380 --> 00:13:19,890
There's so many difficult idioms   -Yeah

280
00:13:19,910 --> 00:13:24,330
Gimmick (11)
Posters with idioms

281
00:13:23,330 --> 00:13:24,580
What are these for?

282
00:13:24,580 --> 00:13:29,250
These are, well, Classical Chinese

283
00:13:29,250 --> 00:13:30,860
Classical Chinese?

284
00:13:30,860 --> 00:13:32,260
How do you read this?

285
00:13:32,260 --> 00:13:36,240
*The correct pronunciation is "Gaden Insui", but Jimmy pronounced it as "Hikita Tenko", who is a famous is a Japanese pop singer turned magician

286
00:13:32,260 --> 00:13:36,240
This is "Hikita Tenko"

287
00:13:37,360 --> 00:13:39,840
You're living here alone, right?   -Yes

288
00:13:39,840 --> 00:13:44,490
*Sound Princess (Otohime) emits the noise of a flushing toilet to spare a woman's blushes

289
00:13:39,840 --> 00:13:44,490
Why would you need to use the Sound Princess?

290
00:13:40,270 --> 00:13:44,240
Gimmick (12)
Toilet with Sound Princess

291
00:13:45,620 --> 00:14:07,460
*The Sound Princess is playing Bonch Osamu's gag, who is Jimmy's master

292
00:14:07,460 --> 00:14:11,450
You're using your master's gag to mask the noise of your poop?

293
00:14:11,450 --> 00:14:13,100
I've been listening to his gags for 30 years

294
00:14:13,100 --> 00:14:20,420
So my poop won't come out smoothly without listening to this

295
00:14:20,420 --> 00:14:23,260
I'll end up having constipation

296
00:14:25,520 --> 00:14:27,300
Can we enter this room?   -Yes, sure

297
00:14:27,300 --> 00:14:29,230
This is just...

298
00:14:29,230 --> 00:14:30,950
What the heck is going on?

299
00:14:30,950 --> 00:14:32,950
Everybody, come in   -Okay

300
00:14:34,960 --> 00:14:37,060
There's so many guitars   -Yeah

301
00:14:37,060 --> 00:14:38,860
Why do you have so many guitars?

302
00:14:37,300 --> 00:14:41,860
Gimmick (12)
A whole lot of guitars

303
00:14:38,860 --> 00:14:42,140
Well...umm...

304
00:14:42,140 --> 00:14:45,860
I was actually a folk "songer" before...

305
00:14:45,860 --> 00:14:47,100
You mean a folk singer?

306
00:14:47,100 --> 00:14:48,980
Yes, I mean folk singer

307
00:14:48,980 --> 00:14:50,360
He said folk "songer"

308
00:14:52,030 --> 00:14:54,590
-You know how to play guitar?   -You were a singer before?

309
00:14:54,590 --> 00:14:57,170
Yes, I can   -We wanna hear you play guitar

310
00:14:57,170 --> 00:15:00,470
Please play the guitar for us

311
00:15:00,470 --> 00:15:05,660
This is the one that I used during middle school

312
00:15:05,660 --> 00:15:11,450
Your tiptoe went stiff   -You're gonna sprain your leg

313
00:15:11,450 --> 00:15:13,800
Sing "Yesterday" for us   -Good choice

314
00:15:16,070 --> 00:15:17,160
Nice, very nice

315
00:15:29,390 --> 00:15:30,690
Fireworks?

316
00:15:32,620 --> 00:15:33,570
Oh my city?

317
00:15:33,570 --> 00:15:36,290
Oh yesterday

318
00:15:36,290 --> 00:15:38,240
Oh my city...

319
00:15:38,240 --> 00:15:40,170
Nice, very nice voice

320
00:15:40,170 --> 00:15:43,050
That was superb

321
00:15:43,540 --> 00:15:46,450
You can even join the "Singing gag contest"

322
00:15:47,720 --> 00:15:50,600
With oh my city, yesterday?

323
00:15:52,430 --> 00:15:54,490
Look at this, Hamada-san

324
00:15:58,230 --> 00:16:00,170
That's the Demae-can uniform

325
00:15:58,230 --> 00:16:04,590
*Demae-can is a home delivery service, endorsed by Hamada

326
00:16:00,170 --> 00:16:03,110
Yes, this is from Demae-can

327
00:16:03,110 --> 00:16:04,590
You work part-time at Demae-can?

328
00:16:04,590 --> 00:16:06,450
"Yes, I do! Yes, I do!"

329
00:16:04,590 --> 00:16:06,450
*"Yes, I do! Yes, I do!" is a one of Jimmy's most famous gags

330
00:16:08,500 --> 00:16:11,130
No, that's not what I'm asking for

331
00:16:11,130 --> 00:16:12,610
"Yes, I do! Yes, I do!"

332
00:16:12,610 --> 00:16:15,080
I told you we don't need this

333
00:16:15,080 --> 00:16:16,450
Are you working part-time at Demae-can?

334
00:16:16,450 --> 00:16:17,820
"Yes, I do! Yes, I do!"

335
00:16:20,720 --> 00:16:25,290
Are you trying to redeem something?

336
00:16:25,290 --> 00:16:27,870
Because you can see how this is going to end

337
00:16:27,870 --> 00:16:30,180
So you're making a full effort to redeem

338
00:16:30,180 --> 00:16:32,500
I can even feel your anxiety

339
00:16:34,610 --> 00:16:37,700
So you're working part time while being a comedian?

340
00:16:37,700 --> 00:16:39,560
"Yes, I do! Yes, I do!"

341
00:16:43,400 --> 00:16:48,260
Can this be aired? This needs to be censored...

342
00:16:49,740 --> 00:16:51,450
What is this for?

343
00:16:52,240 --> 00:16:54,560
"Poop is the absolute truth" (words on the hanging scroll)

344
00:16:54,560 --> 00:16:56,440
Whenever I brew tea

345
00:16:56,440 --> 00:17:01,450
I'll sit formally (Seiza) in front of this

346
00:17:03,410 --> 00:17:05,790
And read this phrase out loud

347
00:17:05,790 --> 00:17:08,370
What does it mean? Is there any special meaning to it?

348
00:17:09,080 --> 00:17:12,480
I'm learning how to brew tea now

349
00:17:12,480 --> 00:17:14,790
You're learning tea ceremony?   -Yes

350
00:17:14,790 --> 00:17:17,510
Why didn't you reply "Yes, I do! Yes, I do!", dude

351
00:17:17,510 --> 00:17:19,290
He didn't think of it

352
00:17:19,290 --> 00:17:21,450
Get your act together!

353
00:17:22,640 --> 00:17:25,310
Please explain this to us

354
00:17:25,310 --> 00:17:29,620
Is that Jimmy-san's poop?

355
00:17:29,620 --> 00:17:32,740
I usually harvest it when I need it

356
00:17:32,740 --> 00:17:34,570
Harvest it?

357
00:17:34,570 --> 00:17:37,280
Is that how you use the word "harvest"?

358
00:17:37,280 --> 00:17:41,770
So you're harvesting the freshest one everyday?

359
00:17:43,900 --> 00:17:45,250
Okay, I see

360
00:17:45,250 --> 00:17:47,600
The freshest one   -Steaming hot

361
00:17:47,600 --> 00:17:49,670
Okay, I see

362
00:17:51,210 --> 00:17:54,710
That's quite disgusting though   -Sure it is

363
00:17:56,240 --> 00:18:01,150
This is the living room, it's always nice to relax here

364
00:18:01,150 --> 00:18:05,320
Good to have a room like this   -You're right

365
00:18:05,320 --> 00:18:07,140
You like Leah Dizon so much

366
00:18:07,140 --> 00:18:09,810
Yinling of Joytoy as well

367
00:18:09,810 --> 00:18:13,960
Yinling...Leah Dizon compilation

368
00:18:13,960 --> 00:18:14,960
You made a compilation?

369
00:18:14,960 --> 00:18:16,770
It says edited on it

370
00:18:16,770 --> 00:18:21,150
Yeah, cut out the best part of the videos

371
00:18:22,540 --> 00:18:25,430
What made you like Leoh Dizon so much?

372
00:18:25,430 --> 00:18:30,330
Because Leah Dizon solves many riddles

373
00:18:30,330 --> 00:18:34,470
Solve riddles? What do you mean?

374
00:18:34,470 --> 00:18:37,000
She was actually a lawyer before

375
00:18:37,000 --> 00:18:38,400
However...

376
00:18:38,400 --> 00:18:41,140
He don't know her

377
00:18:47,400 --> 00:18:49,570
Why are you shivering all of a sudden?

378
00:18:49,570 --> 00:18:54,080
-He's shivering all of a sudden
-Did you collect these, Jimmy-san?

379
00:18:54,080 --> 00:18:57,110
Please tell us the story behind it

380
00:18:57,110 --> 00:19:02,510
She lost her lawyer license one day

381
00:19:02,510 --> 00:19:04,300
What happened next?

382
00:19:04,300 --> 00:19:10,120
Thinking "where is it?" and finding her license, that's what the story is all about

383
00:19:10,120 --> 00:19:13,380
Eh? You must be kidding me? What the heck is this story?

384
00:19:13,380 --> 00:19:15,680
Leah Dizon

385
00:19:15,680 --> 00:19:21,150
Where is my lawyer license...and keeps finding it...

386
00:19:21,150 --> 00:19:24,530
-That's so lame
-So she's finding her license from start to finish

387
00:19:24,530 --> 00:19:27,070
How many episodes are there?   -10 episodes

388
00:19:27,070 --> 00:19:30,380
That's quite a lot   -What happened in the end?

389
00:19:30,380 --> 00:19:35,540
Of course she found her license in the end

390
00:19:35,540 --> 00:19:39,020
What a lame drama   -No way, not lame at all

391
00:19:39,020 --> 00:19:43,420
She spent 10 hours to find her license?

392
00:19:43,420 --> 00:19:46,150
That's all she did in the drama?   -Yes

393
00:19:46,150 --> 00:19:52,010
This sounds interesting in another way

394
00:19:52,010 --> 00:19:55,640
You like Kyojin no Hoshi, huh?

395
00:19:55,640 --> 00:19:57,610
It's a baseball manga, and you play baseball, right?

396
00:19:57,610 --> 00:20:01,150
Yeah, of course   -This is the memory of our generation

397
00:20:01,150 --> 00:20:04,170
But it's all chapter one...

398
00:20:06,750 --> 00:20:08,490
It's all chapter one   -Yes, only chapter one

399
00:20:08,490 --> 00:20:14,000
If you don't read chapter one, how can you read chapter two?

400
00:20:14,000 --> 00:20:16,410
You definitely read it already!!

401
00:20:16,410 --> 00:20:19,040
Just go for chapter 2!

402
00:20:22,410 --> 00:20:24,870
He's starting to scratch his head

403
00:20:24,870 --> 00:20:27,880
You haven't read chapter 2 yet?

404
00:20:27,880 --> 00:20:29,660
I finished all of the chapter ones

405
00:20:29,660 --> 00:20:32,940
And I then read chapter one again

406
00:20:32,940 --> 00:20:34,840
You're reading it many times?   -Yes, many times

407
00:20:34,840 --> 00:20:37,200
Is this chapter one different from this chapter one?

408
00:20:37,200 --> 00:20:39,350
Exactly the same

409
00:20:39,350 --> 00:20:41,440
I bet they are   -Sure it is

410
00:20:41,440 --> 00:20:45,980
I just read it again and again

411
00:20:45,980 --> 00:20:51,570
You really like it, huh?

412
00:20:51,570 --> 00:20:54,080
The calendar...November...

413
00:20:54,960 --> 00:20:58,010
23rd is circled and "Definitely!" is written below it

414
00:20:58,010 --> 00:21:00,650
What does it mean?

415
00:21:00,650 --> 00:21:04,490
These are the days that I'm not allowed to move

416
00:21:04,490 --> 00:21:06,350
Not allowed to move?

417
00:21:06,350 --> 00:21:08,710
So you can't move on the 13rd and 30th?

418
00:21:08,710 --> 00:21:14,180
Definitely can't, or else I'll have an accident

419
00:21:14,180 --> 00:21:16,140
Who told you about this?

420
00:21:19,190 --> 00:21:21,890
It's a book called Des...Destini-ni

421
00:21:21,890 --> 00:21:24,650
Destini-ni?

422
00:21:24,650 --> 00:21:27,420
Not Destiny, but Destini-ni?

423
00:21:27,420 --> 00:21:30,940
Yes, a book called Destini-ni

424
00:21:30,940 --> 00:21:32,990
I read it and made these notes

425
00:21:32,990 --> 00:21:34,790
What about on 23rd?

426
00:21:34,790 --> 00:21:36,960
It means I definitely can't go out

427
00:21:36,960 --> 00:21:40,390
No, no way   -It's circled, so it should be fine, right?

428
00:21:40,390 --> 00:21:42,760
You can't move if the day is crossed out

429
00:21:42,760 --> 00:21:44,830
What about the days being circled?

430
00:21:44,830 --> 00:21:52,100
Well, for 23th, I shall make a big leap forward

431
00:21:52,100 --> 00:21:56,150
Leap?   -What the heck is going on?

432
00:21:57,980 --> 00:22:04,230
Destini-ni told you to "make a big leap forward"?

433
00:22:04,230 --> 00:22:08,710
It's difficult to make a big leap though

434
00:22:09,440 --> 00:22:13,180
Thanks for coming today   -Thanks for having us

435
00:22:13,180 --> 00:22:16,140
Let's leave from here

436
00:22:16,140 --> 00:22:18,180
Thank you very much   -You're welcome

437
00:22:18,180 --> 00:22:22,340
Please come again

438
00:22:22,340 --> 00:22:24,540
Huh? Which way did we come in?

439
00:22:24,540 --> 00:22:26,150
That way

440
00:22:26,150 --> 00:22:27,520
Huh?

441
00:22:27,520 --> 00:22:29,520
That way, no, no, it's that way

442
00:22:29,520 --> 00:22:31,790
Jimmy-san...

443
00:22:31,790 --> 00:22:34,560
What the heck is this, Jimmy-san?

444
00:22:34,560 --> 00:22:36,650
1000 penis per day?

445
00:22:36,650 --> 00:22:39,030
You're working out?

446
00:22:39,030 --> 00:22:40,400
At home?   -Yes

447
00:22:40,400 --> 00:22:42,400
What is this machine for?

448
00:22:43,330 --> 00:22:46,910
You're aiming so high   -Yeah

449
00:22:51,990 --> 00:22:54,780
1000 times per day?   -Yes, 1000 times, everyday

450
00:22:54,780 --> 00:22:55,750
Why though?

451
00:22:55,750 --> 00:22:58,690
To build up my muscles

452
00:22:59,050 --> 00:23:01,150
1000 times per day...

453
00:23:01,530 --> 00:23:03,540
Elbows on the floor...yes, just like that

454
00:23:03,540 --> 00:23:06,150
With your elbows on the floor...

455
00:23:06,150 --> 00:23:19,040
Ouch, ouch, ouch, ouch...

456
00:23:19,040 --> 00:23:21,150
My balls hurt, my balls hurt....

457
00:23:22,530 --> 00:23:25,960
The tip is...the tip is...

458
00:23:25,960 --> 00:23:27,850
I won't be able to use it anymore today...

459
00:23:29,730 --> 00:23:32,240
Let's go   -Thank you very much

460
00:23:32,240 --> 00:23:36,940
Goodbye, thank you very much

461
00:23:37,380 --> 00:23:39,590
It's enough, right? It's enough

462
00:23:42,910 --> 00:23:44,410
It actually doesn't hurt right?   -It does

463
00:23:44,410 --> 00:23:45,840
Because I'm wearing jeans...

464
00:23:45,840 --> 00:23:48,780
Oh, not jeans...
