Subbed by Thanos-no-Tsukai
Thanks For Watching!

2
00:00:23,220 --> 00:00:25,250
Documental might seem
like an individual battle

3
00:00:25,320 --> 00:00:27,190
But it's actually a team effort.

4
00:00:28,360 --> 00:00:29,460
Come!

5
00:00:30,290 --> 00:00:31,330
Whoa!

6
00:00:31,860 --> 00:00:34,160
What an awesome first hit...

7
00:00:34,300 --> 00:00:36,830
So people tend to say that someone

8
00:00:36,900 --> 00:00:38,300
Wasn't funny this time around.

9
00:00:38,570 --> 00:00:41,700
And so I want this to be a godly run.

10
00:00:46,610 --> 00:00:48,340
Ouch!

11
00:00:50,280 --> 00:00:51,550
That hurts!

12
00:00:51,610 --> 00:00:55,320
I think this time will be
godly with me around!

13
00:00:55,380 --> 00:00:57,750
I'll make them say it!

14
00:00:58,090 --> 00:00:59,990
It's gonna be godly!

15
00:01:00,720 --> 00:01:02,020
I'll do it!

16
00:01:04,890 --> 00:01:06,400
Alright!

17
00:01:09,930 --> 00:01:11,270
Is this guy stupid?

18
00:01:11,330 --> 00:01:13,040
That's not in the rules.

19
00:01:13,400 --> 00:01:13,600
No, that's it. If you laugh, you lose.

20
00:01:13,600 --> 00:01:15,370
Is he really stupid?

21
00:01:15,870 --> 00:01:17,610
You can't smile, you're gonna lose

22
00:01:17,670 --> 00:01:19,040
Let's keep going

23
00:02:26,040 --> 00:02:27,080
Huh?

24
00:02:27,140 --> 00:02:28,480
-Huh?
-Wait a second.

25
00:02:28,810 --> 00:02:30,210
Anything else?

26
00:02:31,450 --> 00:02:33,020
-It's over.
-No way!

27
00:02:33,920 --> 00:02:36,720
She smiled!

28
00:02:36,790 --> 00:02:38,790
Yellow, that's a yellow.

29
00:02:40,520 --> 00:02:41,520
Come on...

30
00:02:51,600 --> 00:02:53,400
Huh? She laughed.

31
00:02:56,510 --> 00:02:58,570
Alright, Yuriyan.
A yellow.

32
00:02:59,070 --> 00:03:00,510
That's right.

33
00:03:08,650 --> 00:03:10,820
Alright. Wanna play a game?

34
00:03:11,190 --> 00:03:14,960
I don't really wanna right now...

35
00:03:15,020 --> 00:03:16,830
It's pretty short. I swear.

36
00:03:16,890 --> 00:03:19,530
We've played plenty of games, though.

37
00:03:19,700 --> 00:03:23,330
But alright, then.
If it's short then...

38
00:03:23,530 --> 00:03:24,770
Alright, here we go.

39
00:03:26,770 --> 00:03:28,400
We did the one with the nipples...

40
00:03:28,600 --> 00:03:29,570
Aren't you guys

41
00:03:29,640 --> 00:03:31,210
a little hungry?

42
00:03:31,270 --> 00:03:32,670
Yeah, kinda!

43
00:03:32,740 --> 00:03:34,140
Uh...

44
00:03:34,240 --> 00:03:35,410
I brought some snacks.

45
00:03:36,750 --> 00:03:39,520
I have enough for several people.

46
00:03:39,950 --> 00:03:41,180
You know this?

47
00:03:41,820 --> 00:03:43,250
"Comedian chips"?

48
00:03:43,320 --> 00:03:44,550
-Yeah
-Never heard of them.

49
00:03:44,620 --> 00:03:45,620
Never heard of them.

50
00:03:45,690 --> 00:03:49,120
It's like the ones for baseballers
but with comedians?

51
00:03:49,190 --> 00:03:51,190
They had some with comedians

52
00:03:51,260 --> 00:03:52,430
So you can have this

53
00:03:52,490 --> 00:03:54,100
I don't get it.

54
00:03:54,160 --> 00:03:55,430
Open them up

55
00:03:55,500 --> 00:03:57,230
You have one for each of us?

56
00:03:57,330 --> 00:03:59,130
Sure, there's enough for everyone.

57
00:03:59,200 --> 00:04:01,000
I wonder what I got.

58
00:04:01,070 --> 00:04:02,070
No way!

59
00:04:02,140 --> 00:04:03,140
I'm pretty excited

60
00:04:03,210 --> 00:04:04,210
Can I open this?

61
00:04:04,270 --> 00:04:05,270
Sure, go on.

62
00:04:05,910 --> 00:04:07,810
No way!

63
00:04:07,880 --> 00:04:09,810
That's a big one!

64
00:04:09,880 --> 00:04:11,310
That's the best one!

65
00:04:11,380 --> 00:04:12,610
That one must be rare

66
00:04:12,680 --> 00:04:13,820
That's a normal one

67
00:04:13,880 --> 00:04:15,280
Downtown is just normal?!

68
00:04:16,950 --> 00:04:18,420
Well, depends on how you look at it

69
00:04:18,490 --> 00:04:20,560
Yeah, I guess some are holographic

70
00:04:20,620 --> 00:04:21,690
Pick whichever you like

71
00:04:21,760 --> 00:04:22,760
So there are rare ones?

72
00:04:22,830 --> 00:04:24,430
Can I open mine?

73
00:04:24,660 --> 00:04:26,530
Sure, go on.

74
00:04:26,900 --> 00:04:28,360
Alright, here I go

75
00:04:29,460 --> 00:04:31,330
I guess there's about 20

76
00:04:33,100 --> 00:04:35,340
No way!

77
00:04:35,400 --> 00:04:36,570
Whoa!

78
00:04:36,640 --> 00:04:37,710
Great, eh?

79
00:04:37,770 --> 00:04:38,840
You like yourself too much

80
00:04:38,910 --> 00:04:41,910
Well, I didn't get to choose it though

81
00:04:41,980 --> 00:04:43,080
It was just by chance

82
00:04:44,010 --> 00:04:45,180
It was a coincidence

83
00:04:45,710 --> 00:04:46,720
Can I do it?

84
00:04:46,780 --> 00:04:47,780
Junior-san

85
00:04:48,380 --> 00:04:49,690
That one's holographic!

86
00:04:50,490 --> 00:04:52,090
So Lee V is a rare one? (Editor's Note: 1)

87
00:04:52,350 --> 00:04:54,620
I think that might be...
No, that would be rude.

88
00:04:54,790 --> 00:04:56,290
Lee V?

89
00:04:56,430 --> 00:04:58,330
--"I'll kill you!"
-It's so shiny

90
00:04:58,460 --> 00:04:59,530
The one from Noheru

91
00:04:59,660 --> 00:05:01,130
That's really sparkling

92
00:05:01,530 --> 00:05:03,070
"I'll kill you!"
"I'll kill you!"

93
00:05:03,130 --> 00:05:04,300
That's just...

94
00:05:04,370 --> 00:05:05,670
I don't know him

95
00:05:05,770 --> 00:05:07,700
Well, comedy history is quite complex

96
00:05:07,900 --> 00:05:09,670
I got a shiny one too

97
00:05:09,740 --> 00:05:11,110
They're not so special, huh?

98
00:05:11,510 --> 00:05:13,010
Narumi-san

99
00:05:13,080 --> 00:05:14,080
Just like that?

100
00:05:14,340 --> 00:05:15,940
Narumi's holographic

101
00:05:19,080 --> 00:05:20,280
Narumi-san

102
00:05:20,350 --> 00:05:22,780
Stop making it seem
like she's in a commercial

103
00:05:26,050 --> 00:05:27,220
Narumi

104
00:05:27,290 --> 00:05:29,420
I don't think there's much impact

105
00:05:30,060 --> 00:05:31,060
Press the button

106
00:05:36,570 --> 00:05:37,570
One more time

107
00:05:41,800 --> 00:05:42,800
Press it, press it

108
00:05:50,610 --> 00:05:51,610
Press it

109
00:06:06,060 --> 00:06:07,130
Sideways Narumi (EN: 2)

110
00:06:08,360 --> 00:06:09,360
There we go!

111
00:06:09,430 --> 00:06:12,870
Whose point was that?

112
00:06:12,940 --> 00:06:14,370
The Sideways Narumi

113
00:06:14,440 --> 00:06:15,570
Sideways Narumi!

114
00:06:15,640 --> 00:06:17,870
Why did you throw that in there?

115
00:06:18,310 --> 00:06:20,040
That one's holographic too

116
00:06:20,110 --> 00:06:22,410
Sideways Narumi

117
00:06:22,480 --> 00:06:23,950
It was the Sideways Narumi

118
00:06:24,150 --> 00:06:25,710
Damn it!

119
00:06:25,780 --> 00:06:26,780
That was close!

120
00:06:26,850 --> 00:06:30,990
It was amazing.
But that was definitely Goto

121
00:06:31,050 --> 00:06:33,190
-I sure smiled.
-Your first time?

122
00:06:33,260 --> 00:06:34,420
-It is.
-Yellow!

123
00:06:34,690 --> 00:06:36,990
Alright
Lots of yellows now!

124
00:06:37,060 --> 00:06:39,330
I did laugh for sure

125
00:06:42,660 --> 00:06:43,700
Sideways Narumi

126
00:06:44,830 --> 00:06:47,270
There it is!

127
00:06:47,540 --> 00:06:49,940
I feel like Seiya
smiled as well

128
00:06:50,140 --> 00:06:52,410
You sure smiled yeah

129
00:06:52,470 --> 00:06:53,980
Right now?

130
00:06:54,040 --> 00:06:55,780
I really don't think so,
Matsumoto-san

131
00:06:56,580 --> 00:06:57,750
I didn't smile

132
00:06:57,950 --> 00:06:59,550
Well, whatever

133
00:07:04,850 --> 00:07:06,220
Stop that

134
00:07:06,520 --> 00:07:09,060
That sound's so bland

135
00:07:09,160 --> 00:07:11,630
You're right, that's true

136
00:07:14,960 --> 00:07:16,600
That's mean!

137
00:07:17,000 --> 00:07:18,330
It's just sound

138
00:07:24,040 --> 00:07:25,670
Don't put Vertical Narumi sideways!

139
00:07:28,080 --> 00:07:29,240
Goto-san

140
00:07:32,510 --> 00:07:36,280
Sound can't...

141
00:07:38,850 --> 00:07:39,860
I'm falling asleep

142
00:07:41,790 --> 00:07:42,890
You know...

143
00:07:43,130 --> 00:07:44,160
Huh?

144
00:07:44,230 --> 00:07:45,930
What happened, what happened?

145
00:07:45,990 --> 00:07:47,000
That's scary

146
00:07:48,800 --> 00:07:50,000
Freaking me out!

147
00:07:50,070 --> 00:07:51,570
Whoa, that's creepy

148
00:07:55,500 --> 00:07:56,610
He's still pitch black

149
00:07:56,670 --> 00:07:57,740
You look the same

150
00:07:57,810 --> 00:07:59,410
So you were painted black

151
00:07:59,540 --> 00:08:00,580
It's the same

152
00:08:10,090 --> 00:08:12,090
Huh?

153
00:08:12,150 --> 00:08:13,890
Who's that?

154
00:08:13,960 --> 00:08:18,490
Hello. I'm Janis... Joplin! (EN: 3)

155
00:08:19,060 --> 00:08:20,260
She sounds like Nishioka Sumiko (EN: 4)

156
00:08:20,260 --> 00:08:22,030
Janis Joplin?

157
00:08:22,500 --> 00:08:23,900
-Me is
-Me?

158
00:08:24,730 --> 00:08:26,470
Janis

159
00:08:26,800 --> 00:08:28,400
Joplin!

160
00:08:28,640 --> 00:08:29,740
That's Nishioka

161
00:08:30,870 --> 00:08:32,070
Yeah, for sure

162
00:08:32,370 --> 00:08:34,710
That does sound like Nishioka Sumiko

163
00:08:35,080 --> 00:08:37,550
Me sing...

164
00:08:39,310 --> 00:08:40,450
Wanna hear?

165
00:08:40,920 --> 00:08:41,480
Sure!

166
00:08:41,480 --> 00:08:44,620
I can't believe you can
play a Janis Joplin song!

167
00:08:45,150 --> 00:08:46,150
Sure

168
00:08:46,860 --> 00:08:48,460
Sure

169
00:08:48,520 --> 00:08:49,520
"Sure"?

170
00:08:50,490 --> 00:08:51,560
I...

171
00:09:09,340 --> 00:09:10,350
Huh?

172
00:09:12,410 --> 00:09:13,420
Huh?

173
00:09:14,050 --> 00:09:15,320
Now she said "I"

174
00:09:15,750 --> 00:09:16,890
The song's starting...

175
00:09:17,820 --> 00:09:18,920
That's too long

176
00:09:18,990 --> 00:09:21,220
The quietest ukulele on Earth...

177
00:09:23,060 --> 00:09:24,530
That's a long intro

178
00:09:27,300 --> 00:09:28,300
Just sing

179
00:09:38,270 --> 00:09:40,480
That's too long
Sing something!

180
00:09:41,240 --> 00:09:42,240
You forgot the lyrics?

181
00:09:42,310 --> 00:09:43,710
Are we there finally?

182
00:09:47,020 --> 00:09:48,020
No...

183
00:09:48,720 --> 00:09:49,920
I can't even listen

184
00:09:54,760 --> 00:09:55,760
There we go!

185
00:10:11,610 --> 00:10:13,540
I am Nishioka Sumiko!

186
00:10:13,940 --> 00:10:14,940
So you were Nishioka Sumiko?

187
00:10:15,340 --> 00:10:16,950
No, sorry.
I'm Janis Joplin!

188
00:10:17,010 --> 00:10:18,480
How did you get that wrong?

189
00:10:18,550 --> 00:10:19,550
What does that mean?

190
00:10:20,180 --> 00:10:21,650
-What about the song?
-Mistake

191
00:10:22,450 --> 00:10:24,620
I wanted to hear
a Janis Joplin song!

192
00:10:24,690 --> 00:10:26,320
Now she says "I", huh?

193
00:10:27,320 --> 00:10:32,290
I really love

194
00:10:32,360 --> 00:10:34,800
Fried chicken...

195
00:10:34,860 --> 00:10:35,860
Nice voice

196
00:10:37,630 --> 00:10:42,400
But I prefer my pork

197
00:10:42,470 --> 00:10:44,540
Roasted

198
00:10:46,370 --> 00:10:52,580
My dream is...

199
00:10:54,120 --> 00:11:00,120
to eat grilled Thai rice

200
00:11:00,190 --> 00:11:03,830
Oh yeah! That's all I need

201
00:11:03,890 --> 00:11:06,730
All I really want

202
00:11:06,800 --> 00:11:09,970
With eggs- eggs- eggs

203
00:11:10,230 --> 00:11:14,970
And when it comes to bread,
my brother works

204
00:11:15,040 --> 00:11:19,170
in Saint Germain

205
00:11:19,270 --> 00:11:20,410
At least once

206
00:11:20,480 --> 00:11:22,940
You should give it a try

207
00:11:23,010 --> 00:11:26,510
(?)

208
00:11:27,220 --> 00:11:32,890
What I really love

209
00:11:34,320 --> 00:11:38,930
Is booze. Oh yeah

210
00:11:42,200 --> 00:11:45,700
That was...
Janis Joplin!

211
00:11:45,770 --> 00:11:46,770
No way

212
00:11:48,540 --> 00:11:50,240
I've never heard
that Janis Joplin song

213
00:11:50,310 --> 00:11:51,570
What was that?

214
00:11:51,640 --> 00:11:52,870
Janis Joplin...

215
00:11:54,210 --> 00:11:56,040
It's called Foodshow

216
00:11:56,750 --> 00:11:58,180
Foodshow?

217
00:11:58,810 --> 00:12:00,220
Well, you know Janis Joplin?

218
00:12:00,280 --> 00:12:03,020
Maybe "Mercedes Benz"
is a more famous song of hers?

219
00:12:03,220 --> 00:12:04,520
Merdedes Bents?

220
00:12:04,750 --> 00:12:06,190
That's not what I said

221
00:12:07,520 --> 00:12:08,820
"Mercedes Benz"

222
00:12:09,590 --> 00:12:10,590
Me?

223
00:12:13,500 --> 00:12:14,700
Me?

224
00:12:16,830 --> 00:12:17,970
You talking about me?

225
00:12:19,170 --> 00:12:22,070
No, no...
about Janis Joplin

226
00:12:24,410 --> 00:12:25,840
Mercedes De...

227
00:12:26,140 --> 00:12:27,140
Why can't you say it?

228
00:12:28,440 --> 00:12:30,250
It's "Mercedes Benz"

229
00:12:30,580 --> 00:12:31,680
I don't think
that existed back then.

230
00:12:31,750 --> 00:12:33,580
Of course it did!

231
00:12:37,720 --> 00:12:39,290
Huh?

232
00:12:41,290 --> 00:12:42,290
What's that sound?

233
00:12:53,230 --> 00:12:54,470
An old fart...

234
00:12:59,270 --> 00:13:00,280
A hustler? (EN: 5)

235
00:13:17,160 --> 00:13:18,660
He has a 1 ball

236
00:13:26,700 --> 00:13:28,000
Are you alright?

237
00:13:28,070 --> 00:13:29,240
Watch out

238
00:13:29,300 --> 00:13:30,670
He's shaking

239
00:13:31,840 --> 00:13:34,140
He doesn't look stable

240
00:13:35,540 --> 00:13:36,780
His hands are just...

241
00:13:38,350 --> 00:13:39,510
Can he do it? (EN: 6)

242
00:13:42,250 --> 00:13:43,250
Do it, now now!

243
00:13:43,320 --> 00:13:45,650
Do it! Now, now, now!

244
00:13:45,790 --> 00:13:47,260
You can do it! Now!

245
00:13:48,160 --> 00:13:49,160
What's he doing?

246
00:13:49,220 --> 00:13:50,230
I'm getting pissed off

247
00:13:50,290 --> 00:13:51,690
It's not even moving

248
00:13:51,860 --> 00:13:53,400
What's with this?

249
00:14:00,170 --> 00:14:01,170
There it is

250
00:14:01,940 --> 00:14:02,800
Huh?

251
00:14:03,970 --> 00:14:04,970
Turn around

252
00:14:06,780 --> 00:14:07,910
He's satisfied now

253
00:14:09,240 --> 00:14:10,250
No way

254
00:14:10,880 --> 00:14:13,050
I don't get this at all

255
00:14:13,650 --> 00:14:15,350
Please say something

256
00:14:15,420 --> 00:14:17,290
I really feel like
He's the hustler...

257
00:14:21,660 --> 00:14:23,160
A round girl?

258
00:14:23,530 --> 00:14:24,790
That's so gross

259
00:14:26,560 --> 00:14:28,100
He's even throbbing

260
00:14:29,730 --> 00:14:33,400
Round two?
Dick-kun?

261
00:14:33,700 --> 00:14:34,700
Round two?

262
00:14:34,770 --> 00:14:36,170
A second round?

263
00:14:36,470 --> 00:14:37,870
That's what this is?

264
00:14:41,180 --> 00:14:43,180
Are they boxing?

265
00:14:43,750 --> 00:14:45,310
It didn't work

266
00:14:46,280 --> 00:14:47,320
It didn't work at all

267
00:14:47,780 --> 00:14:49,550
You don't have to do that

268
00:14:52,220 --> 00:14:53,860
What's with these intervals?

269
00:14:55,390 --> 00:14:57,360
Now's time for the round girl?

270
00:15:03,030 --> 00:15:04,270
What?

271
00:15:07,300 --> 00:15:09,070
I don't like this

272
00:15:10,100 --> 00:15:11,370
We don't wanna see you

273
00:15:11,440 --> 00:15:13,110
He's not even a Girl

274
00:15:13,480 --> 00:15:14,680
Get the hustler back!

275
00:15:17,010 --> 00:15:18,410
Bring back the old man

276
00:15:24,620 --> 00:15:26,720
I did it with the beat

277
00:15:33,860 --> 00:15:35,000
He's so stressed

278
00:15:35,060 --> 00:15:36,330
So stressed

279
00:15:36,800 --> 00:15:38,200
It's like he's convulsing

280
00:15:38,270 --> 00:15:39,430
Watch out

281
00:15:40,240 --> 00:15:41,240
What now?

282
00:15:43,000 --> 00:15:44,070
What was that?

283
00:15:48,910 --> 00:15:50,040
Alright!

284
00:15:50,280 --> 00:15:52,680
Let's play the "I want to smell my Dad's farts" game

285
00:15:52,810 --> 00:15:54,450
Are we doing that?

286
00:15:54,520 --> 00:15:55,250
Let's do it

287
00:15:55,250 --> 00:15:57,490
He told us the rules already

288
00:16:02,890 --> 00:16:04,090
That's a small one

289
00:16:04,090 --> 00:16:04,890
Pretty tiny

290
00:16:04,890 --> 00:16:06,590
More than I thought

291
00:16:07,800 --> 00:16:10,930
Alright! Who's doing it?

292
00:16:11,570 --> 00:16:13,130
Please choose, Ikezaki-san.

293
00:16:13,370 --> 00:16:15,640
Alright...

294
00:16:16,070 --> 00:16:17,270
Junior-san, let's do it

295
00:16:18,870 --> 00:16:21,180
Alright, understood.
What should I do?

296
00:16:21,440 --> 00:16:22,610
You stay here

297
00:16:23,710 --> 00:16:25,280
-He's the dad?
-He is

298
00:16:25,380 --> 00:16:27,920
So put your legs up like this

299
00:16:27,980 --> 00:16:29,550
I'm staying here

300
00:16:29,720 --> 00:16:31,750
Alright
Ah, that's right!

301
00:16:32,190 --> 00:16:34,760
Sorry

302
00:16:34,820 --> 00:16:37,260
I'd like you to wear some briefs

303
00:16:37,330 --> 00:16:38,730
This is gonna take forever

304
00:16:39,190 --> 00:16:40,400
We don't have time

305
00:16:41,460 --> 00:16:43,700
This game's pretty messy

306
00:16:43,800 --> 00:16:45,430
-Listen
-Like this?

307
00:16:45,500 --> 00:16:46,570
Right

308
00:16:46,800 --> 00:16:48,470
Leave it there

309
00:16:48,540 --> 00:16:50,170
What about the roller?

310
00:16:50,240 --> 00:16:51,540
That's the son

311
00:16:51,610 --> 00:16:53,040
Soshina!

312
00:16:53,110 --> 00:16:54,980
What should I do?

313
00:16:55,040 --> 00:17:01,580
Uh... it's about here.
So stand up around here.

314
00:17:02,020 --> 00:17:03,020
What's your dad's name?

315
00:17:03,080 --> 00:17:04,420
Yoshihide.

316
00:17:04,490 --> 00:17:05,850
Think that's Yoshihide

317
00:17:09,660 --> 00:17:13,090
And you want to sniff his farts

318
00:17:13,960 --> 00:17:15,300
Do you understand that?

319
00:17:15,700 --> 00:17:16,700
And so...

320
00:17:17,870 --> 00:17:21,940
Since you want to smell his farts, you do this...

321
00:17:22,000 --> 00:17:23,040
That looks hard

322
00:17:23,100 --> 00:17:26,540
And once you flatten this,
you'll smell his fart.

323
00:17:26,610 --> 00:17:27,680
Alright

324
00:17:28,410 --> 00:17:30,080
Then you can come back

325
00:17:30,480 --> 00:17:32,510
But you can also stay like this

326
00:17:32,580 --> 00:17:34,150
Really?

327
00:17:34,250 --> 00:17:35,780
Once Yoshihide farts,

328
00:17:35,850 --> 00:17:39,290
You have to shout "Yoshihide, thank you!"

329
00:17:39,350 --> 00:17:41,490
Since you wanted to smell them

330
00:17:41,620 --> 00:17:45,160
And Yoshihide has to shout something back

331
00:17:45,230 --> 00:17:47,030
That's the game

332
00:17:47,100 --> 00:17:48,130
That's a game?

333
00:17:48,200 --> 00:17:49,400
Alright then

334
00:17:49,460 --> 00:17:50,570
Let's do it, then.

335
00:17:50,630 --> 00:17:51,800
Let's do this

336
00:17:51,900 --> 00:17:54,600
Alright, the dad's farts smelling game

337
00:17:54,670 --> 00:17:56,140
Ready, go!

338
00:17:56,200 --> 00:17:57,240
Do it!

339
00:17:57,840 --> 00:17:59,770
You need to be strong for this

340
00:18:01,340 --> 00:18:02,840
Soshina's pretty weak, though

341
00:18:02,910 --> 00:18:05,410
That's pretty risky as well

342
00:18:08,950 --> 00:18:09,950
It tore

343
00:18:12,250 --> 00:18:13,250
"Thank you"

344
00:18:13,320 --> 00:18:15,820
"Thank you, Yoshihide!"

345
00:18:16,990 --> 00:18:20,430
I'm better at soccer than you

346
00:18:23,200 --> 00:18:24,200
There he goes

347
00:18:24,800 --> 00:18:25,800
That's good

348
00:18:25,870 --> 00:18:27,740
Soshina's still trying
to play it straight

349
00:18:28,870 --> 00:18:31,110
I wanted it to sound like a fart

350
00:18:31,170 --> 00:18:32,510
Right?

351
00:18:32,570 --> 00:18:34,010
The sound was puny

352
00:18:34,240 --> 00:18:35,610
That was close

353
00:18:35,680 --> 00:18:37,650
Yoshihide's farts are kinda cute

354
00:18:37,710 --> 00:18:39,450
Well, Yoshihide is dead, though

355
00:18:40,080 --> 00:18:41,150
I wanna give it a try

356
00:18:41,550 --> 00:18:44,050
So uh... can we give it a break with that?

357
00:18:44,520 --> 00:18:46,320
Well, you're right.

358
00:18:46,790 --> 00:18:48,020
Who's next?

359
00:18:48,390 --> 00:18:50,390
Goto-san?

360
00:18:51,160 --> 00:18:54,430
So once I do this and it makes a sound

361
00:18:54,500 --> 00:18:55,500
Your dad's name

362
00:18:55,560 --> 00:18:56,960
I have to thank him, right?

363
00:18:57,030 --> 00:18:58,100
And I

364
00:18:59,170 --> 00:19:00,300
What should I shout back?

365
00:19:00,470 --> 00:19:01,470
How'd I know, you idiot?

366
00:19:01,540 --> 00:19:02,540
To your son, yeah

367
00:19:02,740 --> 00:19:04,210
I'll shout something good about you

368
00:19:04,310 --> 00:19:05,540
Alright

369
00:19:05,770 --> 00:19:06,840
This is pretty hard

370
00:19:06,910 --> 00:19:08,240
It really is

371
00:19:11,450 --> 00:19:13,720
Motonori, thank you!

372
00:19:16,080 --> 00:19:18,050
"Uchi no Gaya ga Sumimasen" [I'm sorry for my work!]

373
00:19:18,820 --> 00:19:20,120
The name of the show?

374
00:19:20,590 --> 00:19:22,190
I've been looking after you since...

375
00:19:22,460 --> 00:19:23,860
My dad would say that?

376
00:19:23,930 --> 00:19:24,930
Are you eating?

377
00:19:24,990 --> 00:19:25,990
This is a piece of...

378
00:19:26,060 --> 00:19:27,100
Mieharu-san's poop for Goto-san (EN: 7)

379
00:19:27,160 --> 00:19:27,500
For...

380
00:19:27,500 --> 00:19:29,330
Mieharu-san's poop, yeah...

381
00:19:30,570 --> 00:19:31,570
Mieharu-san's poop

382
00:19:31,630 --> 00:19:33,500
Mieharu-san's pretty healthy then

383
00:19:33,570 --> 00:19:35,300
That's a very healthy poop

384
00:19:35,370 --> 00:19:36,800
In great shape

385
00:19:36,870 --> 00:19:38,110
Is it good?

386
00:19:38,240 --> 00:19:39,240
It's great

387
00:19:40,270 --> 00:19:41,710
Well, that wasn't really funny, huh?

388
00:19:44,550 --> 00:19:46,380
Stop it with Mieharu's poop

389
00:19:46,450 --> 00:19:47,980
Sorry, I'm just watching

390
00:19:48,050 --> 00:19:49,620
I think it was funny

391
00:19:50,080 --> 00:19:51,950
Don't get in the way
when it's not even funny!

392
00:19:52,020 --> 00:19:53,050
It was funny

393
00:19:53,120 --> 00:19:54,820
It doesn't matter
if it's funny

394
00:19:55,590 --> 00:19:56,590
I thanked Motonori

395
00:19:56,660 --> 00:19:58,660
And then he apologized
for his reaction

396
00:19:59,190 --> 00:20:02,860
Right?
He's pretty bad at reacting!

397
00:20:05,670 --> 00:20:06,700
What was that?

398
00:20:06,930 --> 00:20:07,940
You don't think so?

399
00:20:09,900 --> 00:20:11,510
That sticks out too much

400
00:20:11,570 --> 00:20:13,570
I think that's leaking a little

401
00:20:14,140 --> 00:20:15,340
Hey!

402
00:20:18,850 --> 00:20:20,050
Hey!

403
00:20:20,380 --> 00:20:21,380
What happened?

404
00:20:23,280 --> 00:20:24,950
You know?!

405
00:20:25,020 --> 00:20:26,520
You know who I am?!

406
00:20:26,590 --> 00:20:28,060
-Who are you?
-I don't know

407
00:20:28,990 --> 00:20:31,260
You always leave me behind

408
00:20:32,560 --> 00:20:33,560
Leave you behind...

409
00:20:33,630 --> 00:20:35,860
You always throw me away!

410
00:20:35,930 --> 00:20:38,100
I think I've seen it in a forum...
Yeah I get it

411
00:20:38,300 --> 00:20:39,500
What?

412
00:20:39,630 --> 00:20:40,640
I'm parsley

413
00:20:41,200 --> 00:20:42,200
Not a green pea?

414
00:20:42,270 --> 00:20:43,540
Or a pepper?

415
00:20:43,640 --> 00:20:44,770
He's a pea for sure

416
00:20:44,840 --> 00:20:46,340
He has to be a pea
No, a pepper.

417
00:20:46,410 --> 00:20:47,410
Pretty thick for parsley

418
00:20:47,480 --> 00:20:49,710
His head is round

419
00:20:50,140 --> 00:20:53,110
You always throw me away!

420
00:20:53,250 --> 00:20:54,620
I like peas better

421
00:20:54,880 --> 00:20:55,980
Who are you?

422
00:20:57,950 --> 00:20:58,950
I'm a green pea

423
00:20:59,020 --> 00:20:59,390
Oh no

424
00:21:01,460 --> 00:21:02,220
He was right there

425
00:21:02,660 --> 00:21:05,060
He was right next to him

426
00:21:05,790 --> 00:21:07,500
Will you apologize to me?

427
00:21:07,560 --> 00:21:10,130
Because we never eat you?

428
00:21:10,200 --> 00:21:11,970
Can you apologize to parsley?

429
00:21:12,030 --> 00:21:13,130
Back at parsley?

430
00:21:13,200 --> 00:21:14,400
So you were parsley after all?

431
00:21:15,670 --> 00:21:18,510
What are you? A pea or parsley?

432
00:21:19,570 --> 00:21:20,710
I'm a green pea

433
00:21:23,880 --> 00:21:26,550
Then don't go back
to saying you're parsley

434
00:21:29,080 --> 00:21:31,690
Well, based on his overall shape

435
00:21:31,750 --> 00:21:35,020
I think it has to be a green pea

436
00:21:35,460 --> 00:21:37,390
All things considered

437
00:21:37,860 --> 00:21:42,130
Well, feel free to be what you like
but tell us who you are.

438
00:21:44,230 --> 00:21:45,570
I'm a green pea

439
00:21:46,800 --> 00:21:48,200
I'm a green pea

440
00:21:48,200 --> 00:21:48,870
He's shaking

441
00:21:48,940 --> 00:21:50,100
That's too much

442
00:21:50,170 --> 00:21:51,940
Is this a standup?

443
00:21:52,010 --> 00:21:53,010
He just keeps going

444
00:21:53,070 --> 00:21:55,340
I won't apologize.
I always eat you.

445
00:21:55,980 --> 00:21:57,310
Yeah, me too.

446
00:21:57,380 --> 00:22:00,550
Yeah, I think almost everyone does.

447
00:22:00,620 --> 00:22:01,620
You don't?

448
00:22:02,650 --> 00:22:03,720
Yuriyan doesn't

449
00:22:07,120 --> 00:22:08,220
I'm sorry

450
00:22:12,490 --> 00:22:13,630
I'm really sorry

451
00:22:14,500 --> 00:22:16,200
He's looking at her boobs

452
00:22:16,700 --> 00:22:18,570
That green pea is a pervert

453
00:22:19,130 --> 00:22:20,800
A perverted green pea

454
00:22:21,300 --> 00:22:22,870
I'm really sorry

455
00:22:23,270 --> 00:22:24,370
He's staring so bad

456
00:22:24,440 --> 00:22:25,970
He's staring too much

457
00:22:26,440 --> 00:22:27,910
I'm really sorry

458
00:22:28,940 --> 00:22:30,440
Oh that's pretty serious

459
00:22:31,080 --> 00:22:32,650
Who's that?

460
00:22:32,710 --> 00:22:34,850
He looks evil.

461
00:22:34,920 --> 00:22:36,380
He's pretty bad

462
00:22:38,120 --> 00:22:39,620
Someone like this is bad news

463
00:22:39,690 --> 00:22:40,690
The green pea ran away

464
00:22:41,990 --> 00:22:43,560
This guy's scary!

465
00:22:43,620 --> 00:22:44,760
So scary

466
00:22:45,690 --> 00:22:46,860
He's sucking on a chupachups

467
00:22:47,090 --> 00:22:48,760
Sweets are great, huh?

468
00:22:49,500 --> 00:22:51,370
He's shouting

469
00:22:51,500 --> 00:22:52,630
Sweets are great

470
00:22:52,700 --> 00:22:54,340
No one hates sweets.

471
00:22:54,400 --> 00:22:55,770
Everyone likes them

472
00:23:22,160 --> 00:23:23,160
I have one more

473
00:23:26,300 --> 00:23:27,340
You don't want it?

474
00:23:28,670 --> 00:23:29,700
You want it?

475
00:23:41,780 --> 00:23:44,850
That hurts, I'm gonna break a tooth

476
00:23:46,150 --> 00:23:47,150
It's like the dentist

477
00:23:47,220 --> 00:23:48,290
Teeth shouldn't look like that

478
00:23:48,360 --> 00:23:49,620
It sounds like the dentist

479
00:23:49,990 --> 00:23:51,530
That's scary

480
00:23:51,590 --> 00:23:53,130
Why did you put a candy there?

481
00:23:53,730 --> 00:23:54,730
Huh?

482
00:24:05,210 --> 00:24:06,940
I don't have anything to give back

483
00:24:07,780 --> 00:24:09,440
Ah, he got him

484
00:24:15,320 --> 00:24:16,580
That's sweet

485
00:24:17,180 --> 00:24:18,750
Huh?

486
00:24:31,230 --> 00:24:34,100
Is he Kuwata?
Green Kuwata?

487
00:24:35,740 --> 00:24:38,510
Expecto Patronum!

488
00:24:41,380 --> 00:24:42,380
He cast an Expecto Patronum

489
00:24:47,080 --> 00:24:48,750
What? Whoa, watch out!

490
00:24:49,150 --> 00:24:49,950
Watch out, man!

491
00:24:49,950 --> 00:24:50,990
Stop that already

492
00:24:51,050 --> 00:24:53,050
That's dangerous man

493
00:24:53,120 --> 00:24:54,120
Anyone wanna pull it?

494
00:24:54,190 --> 00:24:55,320
Of course not!
Five people

495
00:24:55,490 --> 00:24:56,760
That's too many!

496
00:24:56,820 --> 00:24:57,860
Please do it

497
00:24:57,930 --> 00:24:58,930
I'm not taking responsibility

498
00:24:58,930 --> 00:25:00,860
That's dangerous

499
00:25:00,860 --> 00:25:02,330
Watch out, seriously!

500
00:25:02,400 --> 00:25:04,800
Do it yourself

501
00:25:13,510 --> 00:25:14,510
That scared me

502
00:25:14,910 --> 00:25:16,610
Is he an alien?

503
00:25:19,350 --> 00:25:21,150
Maybe it missed?

504
00:25:21,220 --> 00:25:22,350
What's wrong with your nervous system?

505
00:25:22,550 --> 00:25:24,520
That's dangerous, Abareru-san

506
00:25:24,790 --> 00:25:26,120
Ouch!

507
00:25:26,250 --> 00:25:28,220
Huh?
What happened?

508
00:25:28,290 --> 00:25:29,520
Maybe one has something different

509
00:25:29,590 --> 00:25:31,930
Like, the last one you pull

510
00:25:33,760 --> 00:25:34,930
I see. Watch out

511
00:25:37,130 --> 00:25:38,130
Two more left

512
00:25:38,200 --> 00:25:39,300
It's my turn

513
00:25:44,610 --> 00:25:45,940
That has to be it

514
00:25:46,010 --> 00:25:47,370
This is serious!

515
00:25:47,440 --> 00:25:48,440
You're right

516
00:25:48,510 --> 00:25:49,510
This is it...

517
00:25:49,940 --> 00:25:51,210
You go, Seiya

518
00:25:52,210 --> 00:25:52,650
This sucks

519
00:25:52,650 --> 00:25:54,520
I'm really sorry. Ready?

520
00:25:54,520 --> 00:25:55,480
Okay? Here I go

521
00:25:55,550 --> 00:25:56,950
Watch out, something's happening

522
00:25:59,520 --> 00:26:01,290
You missed

523
00:26:02,320 --> 00:26:04,020
He's crazy

524
00:26:04,360 --> 00:26:05,790
-You missed.
-What's going on?

525
00:26:06,060 --> 00:26:07,660
Aren't you smiling?

526
00:26:08,060 --> 00:26:09,700
He's right, he's right

527
00:26:09,900 --> 00:26:11,330
You're smiling, though

528
00:26:11,400 --> 00:26:12,400
What kind of face is that?

529
00:26:12,470 --> 00:26:15,400
Cracker toys are serious business

530
00:26:18,140 --> 00:26:22,010
So I saw a portrait painter
in Shinjuku the other day

531
00:26:22,110 --> 00:26:24,550
And he had a sample

532
00:26:24,610 --> 00:26:25,850
Ah, yeah, I've seen that!

533
00:26:26,010 --> 00:26:27,980
Like, with a drawing on it

534
00:26:28,280 --> 00:26:30,620
So I bought one off him

535
00:26:31,750 --> 00:26:33,120
He told me I looked like a famous guy

536
00:26:34,390 --> 00:26:35,620
Wanna see?

537
00:26:38,230 --> 00:26:39,230
This is it

538
00:26:39,930 --> 00:26:41,530
The Pink no Denwa girls? (EN: 8)

539
00:26:41,800 --> 00:26:43,000
That's them for sure

540
00:26:43,330 --> 00:26:44,400
Definitely them

541
00:26:44,470 --> 00:26:47,570
He had Pink no Denwa on display?

542
00:26:48,340 --> 00:26:50,440
They're pretty outdated

543
00:26:50,800 --> 00:26:52,910
Like Matsuko-san

544
00:26:53,540 --> 00:26:54,680
Or the Three O'Clock Heroine

545
00:26:54,740 --> 00:26:57,310
Nowadays that'd be Shimofuri or something

546
00:26:57,380 --> 00:26:58,950
No, it was Pink no Denwa

547
00:26:59,410 --> 00:27:00,810
Or Choco Planet

548
00:27:01,520 --> 00:27:03,150
I also have these

549
00:27:05,090 --> 00:27:06,090
Oka Yuuta-san

550
00:27:07,150 --> 00:27:09,560
Yuuta-san's slower than the crab

551
00:27:09,620 --> 00:27:10,620
He can't run at all

552
00:27:10,690 --> 00:27:11,860
You're pretty mean

553
00:27:12,890 --> 00:27:14,730
He's slower than the snail

554
00:27:14,800 --> 00:27:17,330
He always takes a long time
to get to the mic

555
00:27:17,400 --> 00:27:18,270
These guys are mean

556
00:27:18,270 --> 00:27:19,330
He had this one

557
00:27:19,600 --> 00:27:21,200
On display?

558
00:27:21,340 --> 00:27:22,500
Where did you go?

559
00:27:22,700 --> 00:27:23,970
To Shinjuku

560
00:27:24,640 --> 00:27:27,510
They had Yuuta in Shinjuku?

561
00:27:27,580 --> 00:27:29,440
This is even before NGK

562
00:27:29,510 --> 00:27:30,810
You're right

563
00:27:30,910 --> 00:27:32,280
A previous Shimofuri Myojo manager

564
00:27:32,350 --> 00:27:34,550
Was also Yuuta-san's manager

565
00:27:34,620 --> 00:27:36,580
And we were in the transition period

566
00:27:36,680 --> 00:27:39,390
And so we got Yuuta-san's schedule

567
00:27:40,090 --> 00:27:41,890
But it said "hospital"
from Monday to Friday

568
00:27:42,560 --> 00:27:44,020
-Whose?
-Yuuta-san's

569
00:27:45,590 --> 00:27:49,300
When I was still in Kishiwada

570
00:27:49,530 --> 00:27:52,900
He asked me if
I was going to take a bath

571
00:27:53,470 --> 00:27:55,740
So he was walking with me on the shoulder

572
00:27:55,900 --> 00:27:57,270
Like from the shoulder

573
00:27:57,870 --> 00:27:59,710
And the bath had like
these jet streams.

574
00:27:59,770 --> 00:28:00,940
And he got in

575
00:28:01,010 --> 00:28:02,810
I told him I was washing myself first

576
00:28:03,740 --> 00:28:04,750
So he got in the bath

577
00:28:05,510 --> 00:28:09,320
And the jet streams
thrust him around like

578
00:28:09,380 --> 00:28:11,420
And then he hit the wall like Bomberman (EN: 9)

579
00:28:13,850 --> 00:28:15,990
He was pretty thin, actually

580
00:28:20,130 --> 00:28:21,530
Maybe the stream was too strong

581
00:28:21,600 --> 00:28:22,600
It was

582
00:28:22,660 --> 00:28:23,660
Against the wall

583
00:28:23,730 --> 00:28:25,600
He hit the wall, right?

584
00:28:26,030 --> 00:28:27,300
Seiya is smiling, though!

585
00:28:27,370 --> 00:28:28,400
How was he?

586
00:28:28,470 --> 00:28:30,470
I grabbed him and asked if he was okay

587
00:28:30,540 --> 00:28:32,570
He said he was, and got back in

588
00:28:32,810 --> 00:28:35,610
And got swung around by the jet stream

589
00:28:35,880 --> 00:28:39,010
He even got hit in the face like

590
00:28:39,480 --> 00:28:40,610
So I asked if he was okay

591
00:28:40,680 --> 00:28:42,150
But he looked like Bomberman

592
00:28:47,020 --> 00:28:49,090
He looked like Bomberman?

593
00:28:53,160 --> 00:28:56,800
Sorry. What's that bullshit?

594
00:28:57,970 --> 00:28:59,300
For real!

595
00:29:01,570 --> 00:29:03,470
Well, that was Seiya, obviously

596
00:29:04,140 --> 00:29:05,840
That was me

597
00:29:05,910 --> 00:29:06,940
I couldn't hold it in

598
00:29:07,010 --> 00:29:10,310
Alright Seiya, you're out

599
00:29:10,380 --> 00:29:12,250
He's out

600
00:29:17,320 --> 00:29:19,490
First one after we've gotten this far?

601
00:29:19,550 --> 00:29:21,360
This is just the first one

602
00:29:21,420 --> 00:29:23,190
I'm the first one?

603
00:29:23,260 --> 00:29:24,990
You're all too good

604
00:29:25,060 --> 00:29:27,090
Well, that's 20 million, so...

605
00:29:27,390 --> 00:29:28,560
Damn it

606
00:29:29,100 --> 00:29:31,630
I laughed at Yuuta-san's Bomberman?

607
00:29:31,930 --> 00:29:34,100
Why did I laugh?

608
00:29:34,540 --> 00:29:37,370
Seiya, so come to my room

609
00:29:37,540 --> 00:29:38,570
And monitor this

610
00:29:39,910 --> 00:29:41,980
Ah we'll watch it from there, right?
Good luck everyone!

611
00:29:43,110 --> 00:29:45,480
Oniyakko-san, sorry about the crow

612
00:29:46,410 --> 00:29:47,480
It's fine!

613
00:29:51,520 --> 00:29:53,420
I'm the worst

614
00:29:54,120 --> 00:29:55,720
I even knew that story

615
00:29:55,790 --> 00:29:58,590
Kubota told it in Osaka several times

616
00:29:58,860 --> 00:30:01,030
So he hit the wall like

617
00:30:01,100 --> 00:30:01,700
Like Bomberman

618
00:30:03,200 --> 00:30:05,200
I laughed even though I knew it

619
00:30:05,270 --> 00:30:06,670
Figures.

620
00:30:06,930 --> 00:30:08,540
Can I be completely honest?

621
00:30:09,970 --> 00:30:14,210
To be honest, I was sneakily smiling all along

622
00:30:14,610 --> 00:30:16,110
But nobody noticed so far

623
00:30:16,580 --> 00:30:18,380
So even if I had won

624
00:30:18,450 --> 00:30:21,550
I don't think I could've accepted it myself

625
00:30:21,680 --> 00:30:23,950
So I was looking for a way to go out

626
00:30:24,020 --> 00:30:25,620
Because I was smiling anyways

627
00:30:29,860 --> 00:30:32,690
I never imagined we'd have so many left

628
00:30:32,760 --> 00:30:34,830
Being the only one here

629
00:30:35,030 --> 00:30:37,200
That was pretty serious!

630
00:30:37,260 --> 00:30:38,470
30 minutes...

631
00:30:40,670 --> 00:30:41,740
So I can laugh now, right?

632
00:30:41,800 --> 00:30:42,770
You can laugh, yeah

633
00:30:42,770 --> 00:30:43,900
Finally!

634
00:30:43,970 --> 00:30:45,270
I'm so happy!

635
00:30:55,880 --> 00:30:57,750
I'm laughing already

636
00:30:59,990 --> 00:31:01,520
This is pretty funny

637
00:31:01,960 --> 00:31:03,620
Yeah, being here is fun

638
00:31:04,690 --> 00:31:06,430
Of course you're gonna laugh from here!

639
00:31:06,490 --> 00:31:07,930
Yeah, that's right

640
00:31:08,000 --> 00:31:09,600
I'm always surprised everyone holds it in

641
00:31:09,660 --> 00:31:11,030
It's pretty funny

642
00:31:16,100 --> 00:31:17,970
Huh?

643
00:31:18,540 --> 00:31:19,770
What happened?

644
00:31:19,840 --> 00:31:21,180
Who are you?

645
00:31:21,610 --> 00:31:23,240
My name is Madame Cat (EN: 10)

646
00:31:26,250 --> 00:31:28,520
Humans look cute when they take it easy

647
00:31:28,680 --> 00:31:29,820
Madame Cat?

648
00:31:30,820 --> 00:31:32,890
My owner was...

649
00:31:33,390 --> 00:31:35,890
A woman of age...

650
00:31:36,120 --> 00:31:37,520
"Was"

651
00:31:37,660 --> 00:31:41,460
You see, she...
thought she was invincible.

652
00:31:41,530 --> 00:31:42,530
Her worldview, huh...

653
00:31:42,600 --> 00:31:46,870
But... she got hospitalized
for something trivial

654
00:31:48,000 --> 00:31:51,170
Humans... can you bring that to me?

655
00:31:51,610 --> 00:31:53,210
The ukulele?

656
00:31:55,210 --> 00:31:59,850
You'll get hospitalized
if you don't take things seriously

657
00:32:01,880 --> 00:32:03,720
Can she play like that?

658
00:32:08,620 --> 00:32:10,390
Looks hard to play
Abareru-san's in trouble

659
00:32:10,460 --> 00:32:12,290
Abareru's in trouble

660
00:32:12,290 --> 00:32:13,690
Maybe she didn't practice

661
00:32:13,690 --> 00:32:14,060
She stopped

662
00:32:15,530 --> 00:32:17,030
You know fasting?

663
00:32:18,000 --> 00:32:19,670
Like when you go on a diet

664
00:32:19,730 --> 00:32:21,100
Ah, fasting, yeah.

665
00:32:21,570 --> 00:32:24,370
You get thinner,
and it helps you detox.

666
00:32:24,470 --> 00:32:25,470
You should give it a try

667
00:32:25,540 --> 00:32:28,240
But when you get started

668
00:32:28,340 --> 00:32:30,540
You can't eat any sour lemons

669
00:32:31,580 --> 00:32:34,550
You'll get cramps and end up in the hospital

670
00:32:35,520 --> 00:32:37,250
Meow

671
00:32:37,820 --> 00:32:37,950
One cat

672
00:32:37,950 --> 00:32:38,950
I feel like her character changed

673
00:32:38,950 --> 00:32:40,220
Two cats

674
00:32:40,290 --> 00:32:41,590
Madame Cat

675
00:32:41,590 --> 00:32:42,920
She's making this up

676
00:32:42,920 --> 00:32:44,090
One cat

677
00:32:44,160 --> 00:32:45,230
Two cats

678
00:32:45,430 --> 00:32:46,690
Madame cat

679
00:32:46,690 --> 00:32:47,690
Abareru-san's struggling!

680
00:32:47,760 --> 00:32:49,730
Remembering her master

681
00:32:49,730 --> 00:32:50,530
Nagano-san too

682
00:32:50,530 --> 00:32:53,170
Seeing lightning strike

683
00:32:53,170 --> 00:32:57,240
From her master's shoulders

684
00:32:57,540 --> 00:32:57,770
One cat

685
00:32:57,770 --> 00:32:58,710
Look at Abareru!

686
00:32:58,710 --> 00:32:59,840
Two cats

687
00:32:59,910 --> 00:32:59,970
Madame Cat

688
00:32:59,970 --> 00:33:01,340
-My stomach hurts
-Madame Cat

689
00:33:01,340 --> 00:33:02,410
Yeah!

690
00:33:02,480 --> 00:33:03,640
One cat

691
00:33:03,710 --> 00:33:04,710
Two cat

692
00:33:04,780 --> 00:33:07,350
Madame Cat

693
00:33:09,220 --> 00:33:12,850
Humans... take care of yourselves

694
00:33:15,060 --> 00:33:17,820
So that was Madame Cat, huh?

695
00:33:17,930 --> 00:33:18,460
Who are you?

696
00:33:19,330 --> 00:33:22,930
My name is... Madame Cat

697
00:33:24,060 --> 00:33:26,470
No, Madame Cat was the one from earlier

698
00:33:26,530 --> 00:33:27,900
Come here, Madame Cat!

699
00:33:27,970 --> 00:33:29,600
What's going on?

700
00:33:29,840 --> 00:33:30,270
She just left

701
00:33:30,270 --> 00:33:31,440
Are there two of them?

702
00:33:32,540 --> 00:33:32,940
She's coming

703
00:33:32,940 --> 00:33:33,940
Meow

704
00:33:34,210 --> 00:33:35,340
She forced her out

705
00:33:35,410 --> 00:33:36,610
One cat

706
00:33:36,610 --> 00:33:37,280
Two cats

707
00:33:37,340 --> 00:33:38,750
Madame Cat

708
00:33:38,810 --> 00:33:38,880
Yeah!

709
00:33:38,880 --> 00:33:40,580
-Yeah!
-One cat

710
00:33:40,650 --> 00:33:41,880
Two cats

711
00:33:41,950 --> 00:33:44,280
-Madame Cat
-Yeah!

712
00:33:44,350 --> 00:33:46,290
Humans...

713
00:33:49,390 --> 00:33:52,060
And their snobbish attitudes!

714
00:33:52,560 --> 00:33:55,130
With your dictionaries
or dietaries or whatever!

715
00:33:55,300 --> 00:33:56,300
Right

716
00:33:56,930 --> 00:33:58,070
He's reading it

717
00:33:59,370 --> 00:34:00,630
Who's that?

718
00:34:01,130 --> 00:34:02,540
A thin tengu

719
00:34:02,670 --> 00:34:06,070
Thin tengu-kun!
I had never heard of you!

720
00:34:06,340 --> 00:34:07,340
Thin tengu?

721
00:34:07,440 --> 00:34:09,410
One cat, two cats

722
00:34:09,510 --> 00:34:10,980
Madame Cat

723
00:34:10,980 --> 00:34:13,550
One cat, two cats

724
00:34:13,610 --> 00:34:15,580
-Madame Cat!
-Yay!

725
00:34:16,050 --> 00:34:17,450
Thin tengu

726
00:34:17,750 --> 00:34:19,090
Thin tengu!

727
00:34:19,950 --> 00:34:21,020
Thin tengu!

728
00:34:21,190 --> 00:34:22,190
Thin tengu?

729
00:34:22,190 --> 00:34:23,020
Thin tengu!

730
00:34:23,020 --> 00:34:23,190
Thin tengu?

731
00:34:23,260 --> 00:34:25,390
Thin tengu!

732
00:34:25,460 --> 00:34:26,460
Thin tengu-sama

733
00:34:28,730 --> 00:34:30,260
He was my ally!

734
00:34:30,330 --> 00:34:31,900
Your ally?

735
00:34:44,140 --> 00:34:45,250
Did you...

736
00:34:47,310 --> 00:34:49,780
come for the Broadway audition?

737
00:34:51,650 --> 00:34:52,390
Who?

738
00:34:52,390 --> 00:34:52,920
Who did?

739
00:34:52,920 --> 00:34:54,150
Who's she talking to?

740
00:34:54,150 --> 00:34:55,160
Did you two come for Bod—

741
00:34:55,220 --> 00:34:56,320
Broadway's audition?

742
00:34:56,390 --> 00:34:57,390
You said Bod...

743
00:34:57,460 --> 00:34:58,860
I can't speak right

744
00:35:00,290 --> 00:35:01,290
How rude

745
00:35:01,630 --> 00:35:02,660
Why are you here?

746
00:35:03,060 --> 00:35:06,430
You think I can't do it after all?

747
00:35:06,500 --> 00:35:07,500
Of course not.

748
00:35:08,540 --> 00:35:09,840
What's with that guy?

749
00:35:09,900 --> 00:35:11,610
He has great eyes

750
00:35:11,740 --> 00:35:14,370
I want to stand on that stage!

751
00:35:14,980 --> 00:35:17,480
-You have a bright future.
-You think so?

752
00:35:17,880 --> 00:35:20,780
You think I can do it?

753
00:35:20,850 --> 00:35:22,680
Maybe you do, since you can speak at least

754
00:35:22,680 --> 00:35:23,320
Get the green pea

755
00:35:23,320 --> 00:35:24,550
Look who's talking

756
00:35:24,550 --> 00:35:25,320
I know, right?

757
00:35:25,620 --> 00:35:27,720
-They should use the pea
-Your perspective

758
00:35:27,720 --> 00:35:28,090
Your perspective

759
00:35:28,260 --> 00:35:30,120
Is very musical

760
00:35:30,660 --> 00:35:32,690
But no one wears a cardigan like that!

761
00:35:33,130 --> 00:35:34,560
Take that cardigan off!

762
00:35:34,630 --> 00:35:36,300
Don't underestimate me!

763
00:35:37,430 --> 00:35:38,870
Say something, manager!

764
00:35:38,930 --> 00:35:40,000
Manager?

765
00:35:40,770 --> 00:35:42,440
So he's the manager?

766
00:35:42,600 --> 00:35:43,240
You can't let this slide!

767
00:35:43,240 --> 00:35:44,500
Abareru's in trouble

768
00:35:44,840 --> 00:35:45,910
I'm sorry

769
00:35:46,010 --> 00:35:47,110
Just take it off

770
00:35:47,170 --> 00:35:50,880
I'm sorry, manager.
Sorry about the cardigan.

771
00:35:51,850 --> 00:35:54,750
It's not good, yeah.

772
00:35:56,580 --> 00:35:59,490
Manager...
That's good enough!

773
00:36:00,050 --> 00:36:01,050
Soshina's in trouble too

774
00:36:02,160 --> 00:36:03,820
Ask the general manager...

775
00:36:04,560 --> 00:36:05,560
Right?

776
00:36:05,630 --> 00:36:06,660
The general manager?

777
00:36:06,730 --> 00:36:08,100
General manager!

778
00:36:08,760 --> 00:36:10,460
This guy? The green pea?

779
00:36:11,230 --> 00:36:12,330
General manager!

780
00:36:12,470 --> 00:36:14,030
That's a green pea

781
00:36:14,100 --> 00:36:17,370
Please enlighten us!

782
00:36:18,000 --> 00:36:19,710
I've never heard something like that.

783
00:36:19,770 --> 00:36:20,910
General manager!

784
00:36:21,810 --> 00:36:22,810
General manager!

785
00:36:22,880 --> 00:36:24,680
-General manager!
-General manager!

786
00:36:24,850 --> 00:36:26,250
That's your general manager?

787
00:36:26,780 --> 00:36:28,350
I don't think so

788
00:36:28,420 --> 00:36:29,450
Now you're doing that?

789
00:36:31,280 --> 00:36:32,650
Finally

790
00:36:33,290 --> 00:36:35,090
General manager...

791
00:36:35,160 --> 00:36:37,990
He didn't say a thing
with Junior earlier

792
00:36:38,460 --> 00:36:40,630
He's talked like three times

793
00:36:40,890 --> 00:36:42,330
In that case...

794
00:36:42,400 --> 00:36:43,800
Here he goes

795
00:36:43,860 --> 00:36:45,300
Tell me what you can do

796
00:36:45,400 --> 00:36:47,530
There he is

797
00:36:47,670 --> 00:36:50,470
-Tell me
-General manager!

798
00:36:50,900 --> 00:36:53,140
You can do anything!

799
00:36:53,940 --> 00:36:54,410
If only we had a song!

800
00:36:54,410 --> 00:36:55,980
If only we had a song!
Or a dance or a performance!

801
00:36:56,040 --> 00:36:58,780
Right! If only we had a song, dance or performance!

802
00:36:58,850 --> 00:37:00,680
You're right, but...

803
00:37:00,750 --> 00:37:02,550
Song and dance won't save the world!

804
00:37:04,480 --> 00:37:05,590
You know that, right?

805
00:37:06,020 --> 00:37:06,650
No...

806
00:37:06,650 --> 00:37:07,750
This is good

807
00:37:08,490 --> 00:37:09,760
I don't know that!

808
00:37:11,730 --> 00:37:12,930
What?

809
00:37:12,990 --> 00:37:15,260
What?
That's pretty lame

810
00:37:16,100 --> 00:37:17,260
He smiled!

811
00:37:18,770 --> 00:37:20,030
He laughed all out!

812
00:37:21,540 --> 00:37:22,900
Damn it!

813
00:37:23,440 --> 00:37:25,010
He laughed

814
00:37:25,670 --> 00:37:27,040
He laughed for sure

815
00:37:27,470 --> 00:37:29,340
What was that?

816
00:37:29,840 --> 00:37:31,010
Damn it!

817
00:37:31,650 --> 00:37:32,680
I don't get it either

818
00:37:32,750 --> 00:37:34,680
I didn't get anything

819
00:37:35,820 --> 00:37:39,950
What a shame!

820
00:37:40,420 --> 00:37:43,220
What happened, then?

821
00:37:44,660 --> 00:37:47,260
Abareru-kun...

822
00:37:47,330 --> 00:37:50,260
Has been disqualified

823
00:37:50,330 --> 00:37:51,930
He let it out

824
00:37:52,000 --> 00:37:54,030
Damn it!

825
00:37:59,970 --> 00:38:01,070
That's such a shame

826
00:38:01,140 --> 00:38:02,280
It's really a shame

827
00:38:02,580 --> 00:38:04,680
My greatest weakness is music

828
00:38:06,150 --> 00:38:07,480
Who cares?

829
00:38:07,550 --> 00:38:10,350
Music is my weakness!

830
00:38:10,420 --> 00:38:11,520
Seems like it

831
00:38:12,420 --> 00:38:14,350
You're right, but...

832
00:38:14,420 --> 00:38:16,320
Song and dance won't save the world!

833
00:38:18,160 --> 00:38:19,460
You know that, right?

834
00:38:19,690 --> 00:38:20,360
No...

835
00:38:20,360 --> 00:38:21,430
That's good.

836
00:38:22,160 --> 00:38:23,430
I don't know that.

837
00:38:25,430 --> 00:38:26,600
What?

838
00:38:26,670 --> 00:38:28,870
What?
That's lame

839
00:38:29,740 --> 00:38:31,140
He smiled!

840
00:38:33,570 --> 00:38:35,580
Let's go, Abareru-kun.

841
00:38:35,710 --> 00:38:37,840
27 minutes left.
What were you thinking?

842
00:38:37,910 --> 00:38:39,250
With the green pea?

843
00:38:39,910 --> 00:38:41,150
I'm parsley.

844
00:38:41,310 --> 00:38:44,380
Huh? He changed it once more

845
00:38:44,820 --> 00:38:47,090
You don't laugh even when you can

846
00:38:48,520 --> 00:38:49,720
You can laugh!

847
00:38:50,160 --> 00:38:51,460
Laugh now at least!

848
00:38:52,530 --> 00:38:54,360
At least laugh now!

849
00:38:54,430 --> 00:38:56,030
A lot of points just vanished.

850
00:38:57,160 --> 00:38:58,200
-They vanished.
-Ah really?

851
00:38:59,230 --> 00:39:00,970
Yeah, yeah.

852
00:39:01,030 --> 00:39:04,740
Abareru-kun had a lot of points

853
00:39:05,310 --> 00:39:08,610
So him going out
is a big deal

854
00:39:09,010 --> 00:39:10,310
Damn it!

855
00:39:10,380 --> 00:39:12,010
What a waste!

856
00:39:12,080 --> 00:39:13,910
This is the power of musicals!

857
00:39:13,980 --> 00:39:15,350
No, no, no!

858
00:39:15,420 --> 00:39:17,250
That's the power of Documental!

859
00:39:18,520 --> 00:39:21,520
Well, it can't be helped if I laughed

860
00:39:24,260 --> 00:39:26,430
To be honest, I was pretty close at times

861
00:39:26,490 --> 00:39:28,300
But it was just so much fun

862
00:39:28,360 --> 00:39:29,530
That's what I think

863
00:39:29,600 --> 00:39:30,960
So while sometimes

864
00:39:31,030 --> 00:39:32,030
It's pretty scary

865
00:39:32,100 --> 00:39:33,500
Once it gets started

866
00:39:33,830 --> 00:39:36,840
Time flies because it's just so fun

867
00:39:37,100 --> 00:39:38,610
I'm not smiling

868
00:39:40,470 --> 00:39:41,780
Wasn't that a smile?

869
00:39:43,810 --> 00:39:44,810
Right

870
00:39:55,360 --> 00:39:57,660
Here we go!

871
00:40:00,390 --> 00:40:01,730
I love you!
Please go out with me!

872
00:40:03,360 --> 00:40:04,700
A sudden confession!

873
00:40:04,930 --> 00:40:05,930
That's good!

874
00:40:06,000 --> 00:40:10,800
But even if you say that... um...

875
00:40:10,870 --> 00:40:11,870
Do it!

876
00:40:11,940 --> 00:40:13,470
You don't really know me.

877
00:40:13,770 --> 00:40:16,810
I do.
You're from Suita, right?

878
00:40:17,140 --> 00:40:18,650
No. I'm from Osaka

879
00:40:19,080 --> 00:40:20,150
You got it wrong

880
00:40:20,580 --> 00:40:21,650
It's a lost cause

881
00:40:22,350 --> 00:40:23,350
You don't love me

882
00:40:24,420 --> 00:40:25,690
You really don't

883
00:40:25,750 --> 00:40:28,460
Bleh! I hate you!

884
00:40:30,160 --> 00:40:32,490
She rejected him

885
00:40:32,590 --> 00:40:34,130
I can laugh, right?
This is funny.

886
00:40:34,190 --> 00:40:36,600
Yeah, you can.
Looking from here is funny

887
00:40:36,660 --> 00:40:38,260
It's pretty fun

888
00:40:38,330 --> 00:40:39,970
How long are you staying here?

889
00:40:40,470 --> 00:40:42,000
What?

890
00:40:42,070 --> 00:40:43,370
Madame Cat?

891
00:40:54,810 --> 00:40:57,120
What's this? Stop it

892
00:40:57,180 --> 00:40:58,180
Love?

893
00:40:59,920 --> 00:41:01,020
And Peace

894
00:41:01,520 --> 00:41:02,990
And power!

895
00:41:03,060 --> 00:41:04,590
And shower!

896
00:41:04,760 --> 00:41:05,860
People forget about me at New Years

897
00:41:05,930 --> 00:41:07,660
What are you doing?

898
00:41:09,400 --> 00:41:10,860
Watch out, watch out!

899
00:41:10,860 --> 00:41:11,730
Soshina's in trouble!

900
00:41:11,930 --> 00:41:13,300
Huh?

901
00:41:13,370 --> 00:41:14,970
Huh?

902
00:41:15,740 --> 00:41:19,240
I think he definitely smiled, though!

903
00:41:20,010 --> 00:41:23,180
He's not smiling, but almost!

904
00:41:23,680 --> 00:41:25,010
Hang in there, Soshina!

905
00:41:26,550 --> 00:41:27,610
He's about to fold!

906
00:41:28,980 --> 00:41:29,980
Hang in there!

907
00:41:32,450 --> 00:41:33,690
Can he do it?

908
00:41:34,420 --> 00:41:35,420
It's now a festival

909
00:41:36,190 --> 00:41:37,520
They made it a festival

910
00:41:40,190 --> 00:41:41,190
Wasn't this Broadway?

911
00:41:41,260 --> 00:41:44,760
Men of... Men of the world!

912
00:41:46,770 --> 00:41:48,470
Make an E with your fingers!

913
00:41:48,540 --> 00:41:49,800
And...

914
00:41:50,370 --> 00:41:51,640
S!

915
00:41:51,770 --> 00:41:53,970
P!
F, P!

916
00:41:54,410 --> 00:41:55,480
Flat!

917
00:41:55,540 --> 00:41:56,540
Huh?
What?

918
00:41:56,610 --> 00:41:58,040
P
P!

919
00:41:58,140 --> 00:42:00,180
F, P, P!

920
00:42:00,550 --> 00:42:02,320
F, P, P!

921
00:42:02,920 --> 00:42:04,650
F, P, P!

922
00:42:05,150 --> 00:42:05,550
F, P, P!

923
00:42:05,550 --> 00:42:06,950
This is bad!

924
00:42:07,150 --> 00:42:09,260
Soshina! Hang in there!

925
00:42:09,520 --> 00:42:11,190
F, P, P!

926
00:42:11,660 --> 00:42:13,530
F, P, P!

927
00:42:13,830 --> 00:42:14,190
F, P, P!

928
00:42:14,190 --> 00:42:15,330
He's like humming

929
00:42:15,330 --> 00:42:15,430
F, P, P

930
00:42:15,430 --> 00:42:16,000
Hang in there, Soshina!

931
00:42:16,000 --> 00:42:17,430
F, P, P!

932
00:42:17,430 --> 00:42:18,100
Hang in there!

933
00:42:18,100 --> 00:42:19,630
F, P, P!

934
00:42:20,530 --> 00:42:22,670
Ah!
I did it

935
00:42:22,800 --> 00:42:24,870
Thanks to you, Ikezaki-san

936
00:42:25,210 --> 00:42:27,910
I almost died with F, P, P.

937
00:42:27,970 --> 00:42:29,040
Was it my fault?

938
00:42:29,110 --> 00:42:32,150
It was all thanks to Ikezaki-san

939
00:42:32,210 --> 00:42:33,750
I took the Stopper role

940
00:42:34,010 --> 00:42:35,010
The Stopper, yeah

941
00:42:35,080 --> 00:42:36,620
Stopper Ikezaki

942
00:42:36,780 --> 00:42:38,850
Don't get so mad, Saigo Takamori-dono!

943
00:42:38,920 --> 00:42:40,890
Who the hell's Saigo Takamori?

944
00:42:41,290 --> 00:42:44,990
I never saw a dog like you
wearing a kimono!

945
00:42:45,060 --> 00:42:46,590
Soshina's in trouble!

946
00:42:46,660 --> 00:42:49,700
Darling, are bicycles stopping
at the Tokyo Teleport Station?

947
00:42:49,760 --> 00:42:51,030
They're not!

948
00:42:52,530 --> 00:42:54,470
Why are you mistaking me for him?

949
00:42:54,530 --> 00:42:55,940
That's a funny name

950
00:42:57,270 --> 00:42:58,810
Sorry, you're from Pokasuka Jan, right?

951
00:42:58,870 --> 00:42:59,870
Please sign this!

952
00:42:59,940 --> 00:43:01,110
I'm not Pokasuka Jan

953
00:43:01,170 --> 00:43:03,580
You idiot!
This man is not from Pokasuka Jan!

954
00:43:03,640 --> 00:43:04,640
Huh?

955
00:43:09,380 --> 00:43:11,120
Chess resident K!

956
00:43:11,180 --> 00:43:12,220
That's right!

957
00:43:12,350 --> 00:43:13,750
Chess resident K!

958
00:43:13,820 --> 00:43:14,950
What the hell's that?

959
00:43:16,220 --> 00:43:18,390
Chess resident K?!

960
00:43:19,430 --> 00:43:20,530
That's too much

961
00:43:21,130 --> 00:43:22,330
They're good

962
00:43:22,400 --> 00:43:23,400
That's Goto-san, right?

963
00:43:23,460 --> 00:43:25,570
I'm Chess resident K?!

964
00:43:25,800 --> 00:43:28,030
This is so annoying!

965
00:43:28,100 --> 00:43:29,600
-You're awful
-Do your numbers again!

966
00:43:29,670 --> 00:43:31,240
Who even is Goto-san

967
00:43:31,970 --> 00:43:33,370
It won't shut up!

968
00:43:35,680 --> 00:43:36,780
I know, right?

969
00:43:37,710 --> 00:43:40,110
This is annoying when he goes like

970
00:43:40,180 --> 00:43:41,310
Sorry, Goto-san

971
00:43:41,380 --> 00:43:43,180
Huh? Wait, Soshina!

972
00:43:44,320 --> 00:43:45,850
Come on, Soshina!

973
00:43:45,920 --> 00:43:46,920
Hold it in, man!

974
00:43:47,220 --> 00:43:48,690
What happened?!

975
00:43:48,990 --> 00:43:51,390
Hold it in!

976
00:43:51,490 --> 00:43:53,230
He was smiling!

977
00:43:53,690 --> 00:43:55,800
That's enough

978
00:43:56,160 --> 00:43:59,170
Come on, that's enough

979
00:43:59,700 --> 00:44:01,430
I tried to indulge you

980
00:44:01,500 --> 00:44:02,500
But you're out, Soshina

981
00:44:02,570 --> 00:44:04,540
He was smiling all along

982
00:44:10,740 --> 00:44:11,740
That was close

983
00:44:11,810 --> 00:44:14,350
It was too funny

984
00:44:17,580 --> 00:44:19,020
It won't shut up!

985
00:44:21,250 --> 00:44:22,390
I know, right?

986
00:44:23,360 --> 00:44:25,830
It's annoying when he goes like

987
00:44:25,890 --> 00:44:26,990
I'm sorry, Goto-san

988
00:44:27,060 --> 00:44:28,760
Huh? Wait, Soshina!

989
00:44:29,860 --> 00:44:31,260
Come on, Soshina!

990
00:44:31,530 --> 00:44:34,300
In any case, the only ones clean

991
00:44:34,370 --> 00:44:36,270
Are Ikezaki and Kubota

992
00:44:36,940 --> 00:44:38,910
That's right

993
00:44:39,110 --> 00:44:40,110
I have no points, though

994
00:44:40,170 --> 00:44:41,370
What about the points?

995
00:44:42,310 --> 00:44:43,740
For tears and laughter!

996
00:44:43,810 --> 00:44:45,380
It's 20 million!

997
00:44:45,450 --> 00:44:48,680
Alright! Let's do this!

998
00:44:48,750 --> 00:44:50,450
Let's go, Soshina

999
00:44:50,520 --> 00:44:51,720
Nice fight

1000
00:44:51,780 --> 00:44:53,120
Thank you

1001
00:44:53,690 --> 00:44:56,020
That was too funny

1002
00:44:56,090 --> 00:45:00,290
Goto-san's serious attacking

1003
00:45:01,060 --> 00:45:02,730
It's way too funny

1004
00:45:02,800 --> 00:45:04,730
I was starting to feel the pressure

1005
00:45:05,630 --> 00:45:08,570
And Goto-san raised the stakes always

1006
00:45:08,740 --> 00:45:10,100
Chess resident K

1007
00:45:10,170 --> 00:45:11,400
What's that?

1008
00:45:12,570 --> 00:45:14,840
Chess resident K?!

1009
00:45:17,080 --> 00:45:20,480
And it reminded me

1010
00:45:20,550 --> 00:45:22,880
Of the M-1 Grand Prix Football Hour manzai

1011
00:45:22,950 --> 00:45:25,320
that I used to love

1012
00:45:25,390 --> 00:45:27,090
You can always say you don't want to

1013
00:45:27,190 --> 00:45:28,190
No, Iwao's fine

1014
00:45:28,250 --> 00:45:29,860
I felt warm and it was just fun

1015
00:45:29,920 --> 00:45:31,860
Why did you call me "Ishio"?

1016
00:45:32,330 --> 00:45:33,990
Why did you change the spelling?

1017
00:45:34,360 --> 00:45:36,460
Tell me if you don't like the name Iwao, then!

1018
00:45:37,060 --> 00:45:39,000
I wasn't expecting that!

1019
00:45:39,200 --> 00:45:40,770
It felt really good

1020
00:45:40,970 --> 00:45:44,940
But it's still frustrating!
So frustrating!

1021
00:45:49,210 --> 00:45:51,210
Soshina did a good job!

1022
00:45:51,280 --> 00:45:53,510
But it was just pretty rough

1023
00:45:53,580 --> 00:45:55,450
Alright!

1024
00:45:56,620 --> 00:45:58,380
15 minutes!

1025
00:45:59,120 --> 00:46:00,750
20 million!

1026
00:46:00,950 --> 00:46:01,950
What game now?

1027
00:46:02,020 --> 00:46:03,020
Another game!

1028
00:46:03,260 --> 00:46:05,060
The metal wheel ball stopping game!

1029
00:46:05,120 --> 00:46:06,130
That's a new one

1030
00:46:06,530 --> 00:46:07,690
A new one

1031
00:46:07,760 --> 00:46:09,230
With your body, huh?

1032
00:46:09,300 --> 00:46:12,670
I think this one
has potential to be the funniest.

1033
00:46:13,500 --> 00:46:16,670
I think it has a lot of potential in general

1034
00:46:16,740 --> 00:46:22,680
You spin it like this
and while you stop it with your balls within 10 seconds

1035
00:46:22,810 --> 00:46:24,840
You have to name school stuff.

1036
00:46:25,280 --> 00:46:27,510
Isn't 10 seconds too long?

1037
00:46:27,580 --> 00:46:29,020
You earn the right to say things?

1038
00:46:29,080 --> 00:46:30,080
Right

1039
00:46:30,250 --> 00:46:31,720
Let's do it!

1040
00:46:31,920 --> 00:46:34,020
So I'm gonna spin it

1041
00:46:34,550 --> 00:46:35,990
Stuff everyone wants to say

1042
00:46:36,160 --> 00:46:37,590
I have nothing, really

1043
00:46:37,890 --> 00:46:40,330
So I'm gonna go from the top?

1044
00:46:40,490 --> 00:46:41,860
More directly?

1045
00:46:42,230 --> 00:46:43,360
This is pretty bad

1046
00:46:43,530 --> 00:46:44,530
Doesn't this seem bad?

1047
00:46:45,900 --> 00:46:47,100
It looks serious

1048
00:46:47,170 --> 00:46:48,170
Let's go from the bottom

1049
00:46:48,400 --> 00:46:49,770
Spin it

1050
00:46:50,300 --> 00:46:51,400
Are you sure?

1051
00:46:51,570 --> 00:46:52,670
10 seconds, alright.

1052
00:46:56,240 --> 00:46:56,740
Here it goes!

1053
00:46:56,740 --> 00:46:57,240
There it is!

1054
00:46:57,340 --> 00:46:58,510
It won't stop!

1055
00:47:00,550 --> 00:47:02,820
More! More!

1056
00:47:06,320 --> 00:47:07,320
Do it yourself!

1057
00:47:07,390 --> 00:47:08,690
He's doing it himself.

1058
00:47:12,160 --> 00:47:15,900
Many vice principals are perverts!

1059
00:47:18,300 --> 00:47:19,300
What the hell's this game?!

1060
00:47:19,370 --> 00:47:20,970
Why do you wanna do this?

1061
00:47:21,700 --> 00:47:23,670
It's the metal wheel
ball stopping game.

1062
00:47:23,840 --> 00:47:25,810
Then say something interesting!

1063
00:47:25,870 --> 00:47:27,110
Don't just blurt any stupid thing!

1064
00:47:27,170 --> 00:47:28,810
This is the the metal wheel
ball stopping game.

1065
00:47:29,180 --> 00:47:30,180
Wanna try?

1066
00:47:30,240 --> 00:47:32,010
Of course not, you idiot!

1067
00:47:32,380 --> 00:47:33,480
Do it!

1068
00:47:34,080 --> 00:47:35,520
Why do I have to?!

1069
00:47:35,750 --> 00:47:36,980
Because it's funny!

1070
00:47:37,050 --> 00:47:38,790
It's not funny, you imbecile!

1071
00:47:38,950 --> 00:47:39,950
Do it again

1072
00:47:40,020 --> 00:47:41,620
Why are you doing it again?!

1073
00:47:42,520 --> 00:47:44,720
Goto-san's attacking is great

1074
00:47:44,960 --> 00:47:47,760
We're out of time, man!

1075
00:47:48,860 --> 00:47:51,100
I'm sorry, since you two are older than me

1076
00:47:51,160 --> 00:47:54,170
To be honest, I'm a huge masochist.

1077
00:47:54,800 --> 00:47:56,470
So I love it
when you attack me

1078
00:47:56,470 --> 00:47:57,640
He's on the move

1079
00:47:58,070 --> 00:47:59,240
I want you two to do this

1080
00:47:59,970 --> 00:48:04,780
I'm gonna eat this,
drink some cola

1081
00:48:05,780 --> 00:48:08,180
Get wrapped in tape
and then get insulted

1082
00:48:09,350 --> 00:48:10,450
Insult me!

1083
00:48:11,650 --> 00:48:12,650
I want you to insult me

1084
00:48:12,750 --> 00:48:13,750
Insult you?

1085
00:48:13,820 --> 00:48:15,390
You alright?

1086
00:48:15,560 --> 00:48:18,790
So you're gonna hold it in?

1087
00:48:19,160 --> 00:48:20,860
Are we gonna spin you around?

1088
00:48:20,930 --> 00:48:24,060
No, you tie me up
and insult me

1089
00:48:24,730 --> 00:48:26,230
Watch out

1090
00:48:26,300 --> 00:48:27,400
You're not gonna drown?

1091
00:48:27,470 --> 00:48:29,440
He wants them to insult him

1092
00:48:29,840 --> 00:48:32,070
I'm sorry.
He can do that?

1093
00:48:36,110 --> 00:48:40,780
You idiot! You're so fucking gross!

1094
00:48:41,550 --> 00:48:43,250
I like him, though

1095
00:48:44,420 --> 00:48:46,150
You're so gross

1096
00:48:46,220 --> 00:48:47,350
I think he's pretty original

1097
00:48:47,420 --> 00:48:50,590
-So I don't hate him...
-Why do bastards like you exist?

1098
00:48:52,530 --> 00:48:54,160
It's hard to insult someone out of nowhere

1099
00:48:54,230 --> 00:48:55,730
And you have great comebacks

1100
00:48:55,860 --> 00:48:57,060
Junior can't insult him

1101
00:48:57,130 --> 00:49:00,500
And you have that hair dye
that looks like shit

1102
00:49:01,500 --> 00:49:04,770
I do think this is bullying.

1103
00:49:04,840 --> 00:49:08,540
I'm saying all the good stuff
everyone knows about you

1104
00:49:08,640 --> 00:49:10,240
Huh? Junior-san...

1105
00:49:10,310 --> 00:49:15,010
I think there's some depth
in being insulted without breaking...

1106
00:49:15,180 --> 00:49:18,020
Wait a second! I already swallowed it all!

1107
00:49:19,090 --> 00:49:19,950
Do this seriously!

1108
00:49:19,950 --> 00:49:20,790
Ikesaki's face...

1109
00:49:20,790 --> 00:49:23,320
Besides, I swallowed it!

1110
00:49:23,490 --> 00:49:25,530
No one asked you to compliment me!

1111
00:49:26,160 --> 00:49:27,860
Insult me!

1112
00:49:27,930 --> 00:49:30,230
I know about that
homemade porn you shot!

1113
00:49:30,430 --> 00:49:33,270
Where you dragged that girl
all over the toilet!

1114
00:49:35,800 --> 00:49:37,340
I know about it!

1115
00:49:37,400 --> 00:49:39,270
I know your wife watched it too!

1116
00:49:39,340 --> 00:49:41,310
What?

1117
00:49:41,370 --> 00:49:43,140
You're talking about
that old toilet licking porn I had?

1118
00:49:43,210 --> 00:49:47,010
That's right. I know you love
making girls lick toilets!

1119
00:49:49,480 --> 00:49:52,220
And tell your wife about this!

1120
00:49:52,290 --> 00:49:55,590
I was right next to her
when she was breastfeeding!

1121
00:49:56,060 --> 00:49:58,290
I thought you were
out of it

1122
00:49:58,360 --> 00:50:00,630
But you were just
watching my wife's tits all along?

1123
00:50:00,690 --> 00:50:02,400
Right, and I fucked her afterwards!

1124
00:50:02,460 --> 00:50:03,460
So thanks for that

1125
00:50:03,530 --> 00:50:04,530
What did you say?!

1126
00:50:06,670 --> 00:50:07,670
What?!

1127
00:50:08,430 --> 00:50:11,070
Don't go around
fucking your elders' wives!

1128
00:50:11,140 --> 00:50:12,440
She's pretty

1129
00:50:13,140 --> 00:50:14,570
She's beautiful

1130
00:50:14,670 --> 00:50:16,540
Then look at my wife

1131
00:50:17,340 --> 00:50:19,580
Junior-san's wife?

1132
00:50:19,650 --> 00:50:20,550
What an odd timing

1133
00:50:20,550 --> 00:50:21,550
Huh?

1134
00:50:24,320 --> 00:50:26,190
There it is...
Sideways Narumi

1135
00:50:26,250 --> 00:50:28,720
He took a picture of Sideways Narumi?

1136
00:50:31,360 --> 00:50:32,590
Goto-san!

1137
00:50:37,100 --> 00:50:39,030
No, you're not married
to Narumi-san

1138
00:50:40,670 --> 00:50:42,740
That's Narumi-san!

1139
00:50:43,040 --> 00:50:44,040
Huh?

1140
00:50:44,270 --> 00:50:46,110
Narumi-san... That's Sideways Narumi!

1141
00:50:48,240 --> 00:50:49,480
Junior-san?

1142
00:50:49,980 --> 00:50:52,280
Huh?
Junior-san!

1143
00:50:52,850 --> 00:50:55,110
What happened?

1144
00:50:55,650 --> 00:50:57,980
You're laughing at your own
picture of Sideways Narumi?!

1145
00:50:57,980 --> 00:50:59,950
You're laughing, right?!

1146
00:51:00,020 --> 00:51:01,850
At Sideways Narumi?!

1147
00:51:02,290 --> 00:51:03,290
He's swimming!

1148
00:51:03,360 --> 00:51:05,490
-Junior-kun! Junior-kun!
-That's Master Kiyoshi

1149
00:51:05,660 --> 00:51:07,430
Junior-kun, do you remember me?

1150
00:51:07,490 --> 00:51:08,830
It's Master Kiyoshi time!

1151
00:51:09,860 --> 00:51:11,360
I appeared when you least expected!

1152
00:51:11,630 --> 00:51:13,270
He's really holding it in!

1153
00:51:13,430 --> 00:51:15,130
I made Seiji-kun appear
several times

1154
00:51:15,200 --> 00:51:16,300
Goto-san's in trouble!

1155
00:51:17,070 --> 00:51:20,470
(?)

1156
00:51:20,770 --> 00:51:24,180
Junior-kun!
Do you remember me?

1157
00:51:27,680 --> 00:51:28,850
They're holding it in

1158
00:51:29,850 --> 00:51:31,780
No way! They did it.

1159
00:51:34,450 --> 00:51:36,260
They did it.
Only nine minutes left

1160
00:51:36,620 --> 00:51:39,160
Still nine minutes left

1161
00:51:39,230 --> 00:51:40,490
What's gonna happen?

1162
00:51:42,030 --> 00:51:43,600
It's 20 million yen.

1163
00:51:44,100 --> 00:51:45,700
That's too much

1164
00:51:46,100 --> 00:51:47,100
Right?

1165
00:51:49,740 --> 00:51:51,100
Who are you showing that?

1166
00:51:51,200 --> 00:51:52,940
He's pointing it to us!

1167
00:51:54,910 --> 00:51:56,140
Thanks for watching!

1168
00:51:56,210 --> 00:51:58,080
Don't point your cock
to the audience!

1169
00:51:58,140 --> 00:51:59,810
You get VIP seats!

1170
00:51:59,880 --> 00:52:00,910
Leave it!

1171
00:52:00,980 --> 00:52:01,980
No!

1172
00:52:02,050 --> 00:52:04,150
This guy's insane!

1173
00:52:04,450 --> 00:52:06,190
Point it at us instead!

1174
00:52:06,250 --> 00:52:08,450
Who's that guy showing his crotch?

1175
00:52:08,520 --> 00:52:10,220
It's you, Ikezaki...

1176
00:52:10,290 --> 00:52:12,530
-It's me!
-That's what I said!

1177
00:52:12,590 --> 00:52:13,960
Why not do Nishio Kasumiko or something?

1178
00:52:14,030 --> 00:52:15,390
He's just showing his crotch

1179
00:52:15,830 --> 00:52:17,260
-What?
-Goto-san!

1180
00:52:17,530 --> 00:52:19,170
-What?
-Never mind!

1181
00:52:19,230 --> 00:52:21,470
You think I shout a lot, right?

1182
00:52:23,000 --> 00:52:24,240
So uh...

1183
00:52:25,840 --> 00:52:26,840
What is it?

1184
00:52:26,910 --> 00:52:28,570
I brought a measuring device

1185
00:52:28,640 --> 00:52:29,640
A decibel meter?!

1186
00:52:29,710 --> 00:52:32,510
Decibels!!
They pick it up, and ring!

1187
00:52:32,580 --> 00:52:34,880
And do like peep peep
and it's like whoa and—

1188
00:52:34,950 --> 00:52:36,220
That hurtsaolin!

1189
00:52:38,750 --> 00:52:39,950
Hurtsaolin?

1190
00:52:40,020 --> 00:52:41,290
The power of nakedness

1191
00:52:41,350 --> 00:52:42,420
We're getting to 0 for sure

1192
00:52:42,860 --> 00:52:46,930
I'm gonna shout into this

1193
00:52:47,230 --> 00:52:48,590
And it'll show us the decibels

1194
00:52:48,660 --> 00:52:49,930
Well we have to do it then

1195
00:52:50,000 --> 00:52:51,000
Here I go

1196
00:52:51,830 --> 00:52:54,030
Here I go, yeah!

1197
00:52:55,030 --> 00:52:57,400
It broke!
Yeah! Whoa!

1198
00:52:57,840 --> 00:52:58,640
He's crazy

1199
00:52:58,640 --> 00:52:59,040
No way!

1200
00:52:59,110 --> 00:52:59,470
No way...

1201
00:53:01,270 --> 00:53:04,680
I broke it from being too loud

1202
00:53:04,740 --> 00:53:05,410
It exploded

1203
00:53:05,410 --> 00:53:06,610
Look at Junior
It exploded

1204
00:53:06,610 --> 00:53:07,580
Yakko-san is out of it

1205
00:53:07,580 --> 00:53:09,350
-The decibels were too high...
-Really?

1206
00:53:09,680 --> 00:53:12,950
That's how powerful my voice is!

1207
00:53:13,090 --> 00:53:14,320
Leg passion!

1208
00:53:16,060 --> 00:53:17,960
You didn't even want me to try!

1209
00:53:18,020 --> 00:53:20,160
You were just gonna blow it up!

1210
00:53:20,790 --> 00:53:23,360
No, it just happened to break like that

1211
00:53:26,930 --> 00:53:28,570
You're taller, Master

1212
00:53:29,700 --> 00:53:31,600
Master Kiyoshi, you're huge

1213
00:53:31,840 --> 00:53:34,310
He grew up so much!

1214
00:53:35,270 --> 00:53:37,610
You're huge, Master Kiyoshi!

1215
00:53:39,350 --> 00:53:40,550
He's tall

1216
00:53:41,950 --> 00:53:43,050
No way!

1217
00:53:44,150 --> 00:53:45,350
What happened?

1218
00:53:45,480 --> 00:53:46,920
He's a talented boy, huh?

1219
00:53:47,150 --> 00:53:49,020
Now you can talk

1220
00:53:49,090 --> 00:53:50,790
Thank you so much

1221
00:53:51,260 --> 00:53:52,590
You suck at impressions

1222
00:53:52,590 --> 00:53:53,530
You're skeletal

1223
00:53:53,590 --> 00:53:55,190
And he does suck at this

1224
00:53:57,060 --> 00:53:59,600
You're so lanky
it's gross

1225
00:54:02,430 --> 00:54:03,970
Sorry, I've never seen this
I'm gonna go lickity lick!

1226
00:54:04,040 --> 00:54:06,310
Lickity Lick Boom!

1227
00:54:06,540 --> 00:54:08,110
Lickity Boom!

1228
00:54:08,970 --> 00:54:10,010
He went insane

1229
00:54:10,680 --> 00:54:12,110
We're going insane!

1230
00:54:13,450 --> 00:54:15,880
Isn't it okay to go insane?!

1231
00:54:15,980 --> 00:54:16,980
What was that?!

1232
00:54:17,050 --> 00:54:18,950
-Let's do this.
-Let's do what?!

1233
00:54:19,120 --> 00:54:22,220
Don't you think
I have huge lung capacity?

1234
00:54:22,290 --> 00:54:23,290
I have no clue

1235
00:54:23,360 --> 00:54:24,990
You have goosebumps

1236
00:54:25,060 --> 00:54:26,690
I'm not a goose, I'm a phoenix!

1237
00:54:26,760 --> 00:54:29,500
Blah Pikipiki do you have pistachios for brains?

1238
00:54:29,560 --> 00:54:31,160
-You went too far, idiot.
-Ah, my power!

1239
00:54:33,000 --> 00:54:35,170
Want me to bring you down?

1240
00:54:35,430 --> 00:54:36,640
Let's do this

1241
00:54:38,140 --> 00:54:41,440
First we plug this in

1242
00:54:42,370 --> 00:54:44,880
Sunsha-in!!

1243
00:54:48,210 --> 00:54:49,420
Open your mouth, please

1244
00:54:54,590 --> 00:54:56,060
It's pretty strong

1245
00:54:56,260 --> 00:54:57,460
So...

1246
00:54:58,290 --> 00:54:59,460
That's rough

1247
00:55:00,230 --> 00:55:04,160
We connect it to the hose,
and in this end that goes into my mouth,

1248
00:55:04,230 --> 00:55:06,030
We pour some liquid

1249
00:55:06,330 --> 00:55:09,070
And if I push it back, I win

1250
00:55:09,800 --> 00:55:10,840
Like this...

1251
00:55:11,140 --> 00:55:14,270
Alright then, let's do it

1252
00:55:14,970 --> 00:55:18,410
Keep it pressed
until it's off my mouth

1253
00:55:18,480 --> 00:55:19,710
Ah, alright

1254
00:55:19,910 --> 00:55:20,980
I think vertically works better

1255
00:55:21,050 --> 00:55:23,120
Like this?
That makes it stronger

1256
00:55:23,550 --> 00:55:25,280
This is annoying.
Here I go

1257
00:55:26,590 --> 00:55:27,950
Red nipple!

1258
00:55:28,020 --> 00:55:29,260
Put it in!

1259
00:55:31,660 --> 00:55:32,660
Sunshine!

1260
00:55:33,690 --> 00:55:34,890
What's that?

1261
00:55:35,060 --> 00:55:36,460
Can you drink that?!

1262
00:55:36,530 --> 00:55:39,470
I don't have to drink it,
I just have to...

1263
00:55:39,530 --> 00:55:40,700
Make sure it doesn't get there

1264
00:55:40,770 --> 00:55:41,770
Right

1265
00:55:42,100 --> 00:55:43,840
So that's how it is, huh?

1266
00:55:43,900 --> 00:55:48,970
I think the tomato juice
might end up looking

1267
00:55:49,040 --> 00:55:50,840
Like blood spilling from the sides

1268
00:55:50,910 --> 00:55:52,280
I'm in a risky position as well then

1269
00:55:54,180 --> 00:55:55,250
So we're seeing who has better

1270
00:55:55,310 --> 00:55:56,320
lung capacity.
That's right

1271
00:55:57,350 --> 00:55:58,420
Alright, let's do it

1272
00:55:58,480 --> 00:55:59,490
Right

1273
00:55:59,890 --> 00:56:03,360
Here I go
One, two...

1274
00:56:04,890 --> 00:56:06,630
NO way!

1275
00:56:06,830 --> 00:56:08,560
Whoa!

1276
00:56:09,760 --> 00:56:10,830
No way!

1277
00:56:12,700 --> 00:56:13,970
Huh?

1278
00:56:17,270 --> 00:56:20,040
Hey, have you seen my wallet?

1279
00:56:22,070 --> 00:56:23,080
I can't find it

1280
00:56:23,140 --> 00:56:25,610
He's an old man

1281
00:56:26,310 --> 00:56:27,680
This right here?

1282
00:56:27,810 --> 00:56:29,380
Is it this one?

1283
00:56:29,450 --> 00:56:30,950
Right, right.
Your wallet

1284
00:56:31,750 --> 00:56:33,090
Who's that?

1285
00:56:34,350 --> 00:56:36,860
Yeah, my wallet.
This is a sauce jar

1286
00:56:36,920 --> 00:56:38,790
I'm gonna smash
your head in with a log!

1287
00:56:38,790 --> 00:56:39,330
Whoa!

1288
00:56:39,860 --> 00:56:41,190
Can you please do it?

1289
00:56:41,930 --> 00:56:43,360
It's getting scary

1290
00:56:43,730 --> 00:56:44,730
Why are you doing that?

1291
00:56:44,800 --> 00:56:46,370
Why could he doing that?

1292
00:56:47,130 --> 00:56:48,130
That was amazing

1293
00:56:48,430 --> 00:56:49,440
Too much

1294
00:56:49,500 --> 00:56:50,770
It was too much

1295
00:56:51,070 --> 00:56:52,840
I thought it was amazing

1296
00:57:01,180 --> 00:57:02,750
You know this person?

1297
00:57:02,820 --> 00:57:04,620
I don't really know them

1298
00:57:04,680 --> 00:57:05,990
You know this person?

1299
00:57:06,220 --> 00:57:07,550
I don't know them

1300
00:57:07,620 --> 00:57:08,990
Really?

1301
00:57:10,020 --> 00:57:11,020
She's getting ignored

1302
00:57:11,090 --> 00:57:13,760
Fast-paced stuff is better now

1303
00:57:20,070 --> 00:57:21,570
What's he doing?
He's attacking.

1304
00:57:21,800 --> 00:57:22,870
What's that?

1305
00:57:23,400 --> 00:57:25,300
You can do that?

1306
00:57:26,340 --> 00:57:28,370
That's great

1307
00:57:30,280 --> 00:57:32,210
But can he do it in three minutes?

1308
00:57:33,480 --> 00:57:34,880
That one's from the game, right?

1309
00:57:34,950 --> 00:57:36,220
Yeah, the same one

1310
00:57:38,480 --> 00:57:39,750
We gather everyone

1311
00:57:40,120 --> 00:57:41,350
In three minutes?

1312
00:57:41,420 --> 00:57:43,320
We only have three minutes left

1313
00:57:43,790 --> 00:57:46,760
The pitch gets higher
with less water

1314
00:57:51,830 --> 00:57:53,430
How long is he gonna keep that up?

1315
00:57:56,500 --> 00:57:57,500
So delicious

1316
00:57:58,670 --> 00:58:00,310
Why did you waste our time here?

1317
00:58:01,740 --> 00:58:03,810
Yeah, he's got a point

1318
00:58:03,880 --> 00:58:05,410
On point

1319
00:58:05,680 --> 00:58:07,750
Ah, look at Madame Cat

1320
00:58:08,410 --> 00:58:10,220
Yakko-san, one moment

1321
00:58:10,280 --> 00:58:12,150
There's something I wanna do
no matter what

1322
00:58:12,220 --> 00:58:13,250
And I'd like to do it today

1323
00:58:13,450 --> 00:58:14,720
What?
You see I've never...

1324
00:58:14,790 --> 00:58:16,520
wrestled with a woman

1325
00:58:16,660 --> 00:58:18,220
So I wanna experience it
at least once

1326
00:58:18,290 --> 00:58:19,490
That's dangerous

1327
00:58:20,160 --> 00:58:21,690
Let's do it

1328
00:58:21,760 --> 00:58:22,900
Yakko-san will be fine, right?

1329
00:58:22,960 --> 00:58:27,130
Let's do it. I've done it for Itte Q anyway. (EN: 11)

1330
00:58:27,200 --> 00:58:28,430
Right!

1331
00:58:28,500 --> 00:58:29,770
Female wrestling

1332
00:58:31,070 --> 00:58:32,540
That's dangerous

1333
00:58:32,540 --> 00:58:33,540
Alright, ready?

1334
00:58:33,610 --> 00:58:35,410
Excuse me...
Here we go!

1335
00:58:35,810 --> 00:58:38,310
Start!

1336
00:58:39,340 --> 00:58:40,580
What's this?

1337
00:58:42,710 --> 00:58:43,980
Watch out, watch out!

1338
00:58:44,120 --> 00:58:45,220
It hurts, I'm going to...

1339
00:58:45,550 --> 00:58:46,550
Watch out

1340
00:58:46,620 --> 00:58:48,290
-Did you piss yourself?
-No...

1341
00:58:49,990 --> 00:58:51,360
She pissed herself

1342
00:58:53,360 --> 00:58:55,660
-She pissed herself?
-Are you alright?

1343
00:58:56,460 --> 00:58:57,900
I just heard her say she was going to..

1344
00:58:57,960 --> 00:59:00,370
Hey, you were
touching her chest, right?

1345
00:59:00,430 --> 00:59:02,000
No, I wasn't

1346
00:59:02,070 --> 00:59:03,470
You just did it like...

1347
00:59:03,540 --> 00:59:05,300
I didn't. Just her neck

1348
00:59:05,370 --> 00:59:07,710
-That's very serious!
-I only touched her neck

1349
00:59:08,010 --> 00:59:09,310
Because she was gonna fall

1350
00:59:10,980 --> 00:59:13,080
Don't squeeze Oniyakko-san's neck, man

1351
00:59:13,850 --> 00:59:15,550
The neck is serious business

1352
00:59:16,050 --> 00:59:17,320
Stop wrestling already

1353
00:59:17,380 --> 00:59:18,380
I'm sorry

1354
00:59:18,620 --> 00:59:20,090
This is serious!

1355
00:59:20,920 --> 00:59:21,920
Alright

1356
00:59:22,150 --> 00:59:23,160
One minute left

1357
00:59:23,220 --> 00:59:24,320
Here we go

1358
00:59:24,390 --> 00:59:26,260
They can still do it
One last effort!

1359
00:59:26,330 --> 00:59:27,590
You can do it!

1360
00:59:28,160 --> 00:59:30,100
Can I be Goku when Krillin died?

1361
00:59:31,660 --> 00:59:32,230
Sure

1362
00:59:32,230 --> 00:59:33,230
You're gonna act?

1363
00:59:33,300 --> 00:59:33,870
Do it, man

1364
00:59:33,870 --> 00:59:35,830
Are you talking...

1365
00:59:35,830 --> 00:59:37,200
Do something already

1366
00:59:37,200 --> 00:59:39,570
Are you talking about Krillin?!

1367
00:59:41,170 --> 00:59:42,670
Why did you wanna do that?

1368
00:59:43,240 --> 00:59:44,380
As a last gag?

1369
00:59:44,440 --> 00:59:45,780
Impressions are good

1370
00:59:47,480 --> 00:59:49,520
I don't even know
what they're doing

1371
00:59:49,580 --> 00:59:50,580
Impressions

1372
00:59:51,750 --> 00:59:53,720
Are you talking about Krillin?

1373
00:59:55,720 --> 00:59:57,890
Are you talking about Krillin?

1374
00:59:57,960 --> 00:59:59,420
Are you talking about Krillin?

1375
00:59:59,490 --> 01:00:00,660
Have you watched it?

1376
01:00:03,800 --> 01:00:06,330
Are you talking about Krillin?!

1377
01:00:07,170 --> 01:00:09,130
Are you talking about Krillin...?

1378
01:00:10,070 --> 01:00:11,070
Look at Goto-san

1379
01:00:11,140 --> 01:00:11,700
Are you talking about Krillin?!

1380
01:00:11,700 --> 01:00:12,970
-The 20 million...
-Are you talking about Krillin?!

1381
01:00:13,370 --> 01:00:15,510
All this for 20 million

1382
01:00:15,670 --> 01:00:17,410
You don't have to say it too

1383
01:00:18,340 --> 01:00:19,810
Are you talking about Krillin...?

1384
01:00:22,080 --> 01:00:23,280
Are you talking about Krillin?!

1385
01:00:25,120 --> 01:00:26,590
I'm sure no one's watched Dragon Ball

1386
01:00:28,220 --> 01:00:32,120
You're all shouting and stuff

1387
01:00:32,190 --> 01:00:34,030
But Junior-san hasn't read Dragon Ball

1388
01:00:34,090 --> 01:00:35,430
So it's all gibberish to him

1389
01:00:37,060 --> 01:00:38,060
Is that true?

1390
01:00:38,130 --> 01:00:39,360
No Japanese ever

1391
01:00:39,430 --> 01:00:41,370
No Japanese hasn't watched Dragon Ball

1392
01:00:44,370 --> 01:00:45,440
What now?!

1393
01:00:46,640 --> 01:00:48,310
Alright, let's deliberate

1394
01:00:50,410 --> 01:00:51,510
First time I've stayed till the end

1395
01:00:51,510 --> 01:00:52,810
I didn't notice

1396
01:00:52,980 --> 01:00:54,380
That was short

1397
01:00:54,810 --> 01:00:56,680
Good job, everyone!

1398
01:00:59,750 --> 01:01:01,820
That was great!

1399
01:01:02,090 --> 01:01:05,390
It really was
a deadly duel

1400
01:01:05,860 --> 01:01:09,530
I thought a little more time
would've been better

1401
01:01:09,600 --> 01:01:12,200
But these are the rules
we decided.

1402
01:01:12,660 --> 01:01:14,530
We have a winner.

1403
01:01:16,030 --> 01:01:17,040
Whoa, 20 million!

1404
01:01:18,940 --> 01:01:22,240
The person who gets the 20 million is...

1405
01:01:26,080 --> 01:01:27,080
Kubota!

1406
01:01:28,880 --> 01:01:30,720
No way!

1407
01:01:31,750 --> 01:01:33,820
20 million revenge!

1408
01:01:33,890 --> 01:01:35,120
Good for you, man

1409
01:01:35,190 --> 01:01:36,420
No way!

1410
01:01:36,890 --> 01:01:38,320
That's so good!

1411
01:01:38,390 --> 01:01:40,790
No way!
He got them back!

1412
01:01:41,630 --> 01:01:42,630
He did it!

1413
01:01:42,690 --> 01:01:44,300
The guy came back for his money!

1414
01:01:45,460 --> 01:01:46,470
He did it for this!

1415
01:01:46,870 --> 01:01:49,200
Can I really? I'm sorry...

1416
01:01:50,470 --> 01:01:52,270
He's crying over 20 million!

1417
01:01:53,410 --> 01:01:55,210
I think it's the first time I've cried like this

1418
01:01:56,310 --> 01:01:59,480
He got them back!

1419
01:01:59,540 --> 01:02:01,850
Well, that's right.
He came back for them

1420
01:02:01,910 --> 01:02:03,180
So good!
That's amazing!

1421
01:02:03,250 --> 01:02:04,350
That's good.

1422
01:02:04,420 --> 01:02:06,220
He got them back after so long

1423
01:02:06,290 --> 01:02:07,290
You deserve it!

1424
01:02:07,350 --> 01:02:08,120
I'm sorry

1425
01:02:08,120 --> 01:02:09,620
In any case, congratulations Kubota!

1426
01:02:10,320 --> 01:02:12,060
Congratulations!

1427
01:02:14,360 --> 01:02:15,590
Back to back!

1428
01:02:19,900 --> 01:02:21,830
I'm back, baby!

1429
01:02:22,600 --> 01:02:25,870
I said I couldn't die yet!

1430
01:02:26,410 --> 01:02:29,270
Time and time again

1431
01:02:29,570 --> 01:02:31,510
Maybe I should give a lecture

1432
01:02:32,410 --> 01:02:33,750
Thank you so much

1433
01:02:33,980 --> 01:02:36,250
Thank you very much, to you all

1434
01:02:36,620 --> 01:02:38,350
I didn't even cry at the M-1.
This is a first.

1435
01:02:38,420 --> 01:02:39,790
I cried at the end.

1436
01:02:40,290 --> 01:02:41,390
I'm sorry

1437
01:02:42,520 --> 01:02:44,360
He's crying over 20 million!

1438
01:02:44,420 --> 01:02:45,590
I wanna tell everyone

1439
01:02:45,660 --> 01:02:46,930
That even trash like me

1440
01:02:47,030 --> 01:02:50,600
Should aim to get some big cash

1441
01:02:50,660 --> 01:02:53,600
That's what I'd like to say

1442
01:02:55,700 --> 01:02:56,700
Good job

1443
01:02:56,770 --> 01:02:57,870
Good job, you guys

1444
01:02:58,070 --> 01:02:59,100
That was incredible

1445
01:02:59,170 --> 01:03:01,270
Yeah, you're right

1446
01:03:01,340 --> 01:03:05,640
It was a really close call.

1447
01:03:05,710 --> 01:03:07,950
It was very, very close.

1448
01:03:08,080 --> 01:03:10,950
Well, only Ikezaki and Kubota were clean

1449
01:03:11,020 --> 01:03:13,350
So it was those two

1450
01:03:13,720 --> 01:03:16,020
Here I go, yeah!

1451
01:03:16,290 --> 01:03:19,290
I broke it!

1452
01:03:21,060 --> 01:03:22,660
Sorry, I came here to lick

1453
01:03:22,730 --> 01:03:25,100
Lickity lick boom!
Lickity lick boom!

1454
01:03:25,160 --> 01:03:26,570
Lickity lick boom!

1455
01:03:27,570 --> 01:03:30,470
These guys are insane

1456
01:03:30,670 --> 01:03:35,040
But Ikezaki didn't get
as many points as Kubota

1457
01:03:35,270 --> 01:03:36,840
But I thought Ikezaki's

1458
01:03:36,910 --> 01:03:39,810
Stunt games were
incredibly fun.

1459
01:03:39,880 --> 01:03:42,280
But other people didn't react much

1460
01:03:42,750 --> 01:03:44,650
Gag balloon!

1461
01:03:49,820 --> 01:03:53,130
Not just the players
but the staff weren't laughing either

1462
01:03:55,190 --> 01:03:57,900
So I thought maybe
I was in the minority

1463
01:03:57,960 --> 01:04:00,330
You lose if you laugh

1464
01:04:00,930 --> 01:04:02,400
No one's laughing

1465
01:04:02,530 --> 01:04:03,700
So if you...

1466
01:04:03,770 --> 01:04:06,410
Yeah, but that goes
for Documental as a whole

1467
01:04:07,140 --> 01:04:08,670
What an unnecessary explanation

1468
01:04:08,810 --> 01:04:10,110
Is this guy stupid?

1469
01:04:10,180 --> 01:04:11,940
That's just the rules

1470
01:04:15,680 --> 01:04:18,850
The size of those briefs was just...

1471
01:04:18,920 --> 01:04:20,720
I never imagined that!

1472
01:04:21,790 --> 01:04:23,990
And the ball was like
completely black too!

1473
01:04:25,790 --> 01:04:27,430
You can just expose
anyone who complains.

1474
01:04:28,060 --> 01:04:29,560
That's weird

1475
01:04:29,630 --> 01:04:31,230
Like this on a video.

1476
01:04:31,960 --> 01:04:33,470
Like getting back at them?
