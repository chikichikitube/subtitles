00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,990
Matsumoto Meets Michael Jackson

2
00:00:05,270 --> 00:00:08,470
"We're told Michael Jackson is due to visit Japan soon...."

3
00:00:08,470 --> 00:00:11,430
"....given that Matsumoto-san and Michael Jackson are such good friends..."

4
00:00:11,430 --> 00:00:15,330
"....is it true that MJ hangs out with Matsumoto-san at his house whenever he visits Japan?"

5
00:00:15,680 --> 00:00:17,940
I guess you could say Michael and I go back a long way...

6
00:00:17,940 --> 00:00:20,570
....back to the time he made his earlier trip to Japan!

7
00:00:20,570 --> 00:00:22,680
Wow! Was it a chance first encounter?

8
00:00:22,680 --> 00:00:23,740
Not really, I went to see him in concert.

9
00:00:24,680 --> 00:00:25,880
What's so special about that?!

10
00:00:26,210 --> 00:00:27,750
No, no, that was just how it all began!

11
00:00:27,750 --> 00:00:28,910
Ok.

12
00:00:28,910 --> 00:00:30,880
I was in the front row!

13
00:00:31,500 --> 00:00:32,180
No kidding?

14
00:00:32,180 --> 00:00:35,170
I guess Michael sensed something special in me then!

15
00:00:35,170 --> 00:00:37,390
Of the several ten-thousands in the audience, I guess he was struck by how I was looking at him!

16
00:00:37,390 --> 00:00:40,390
I guess I really stood out!

17
00:00:40,770 --> 00:00:43,510
You can really tell, 'This guy's a hard-core fan!'

18
00:00:44,060 --> 00:00:48,420
The intensity with which I was watching his act must have carried through to him!

19
00:00:48,420 --> 00:00:51,770
I guess it was from the second half of the show that Michael would just stand right in front of me....

20
00:00:51,770 --> 00:00:54,370
...and do THIS!!

21
00:01:00,140 --> 00:01:01,870
And that's when he started visiting me, and hanging out with me at my place!

22
00:01:01,870 --> 00:01:03,080
Many times, huh?

23
00:01:03,870 --> 00:01:05,210
I guess so!!

24
00:01:05,210 --> 00:01:07,020
Right, but the guy wants to know what the two of you would be up to!

25
00:01:07,790 --> 00:01:09,900
Well, he would help out around the house in many ways!

26
00:01:11,880 --> 00:01:12,860
With what?!

27
00:01:12,860 --> 00:01:18,300
Well, for example - when I would be doing the dishes, he would be waiting next to me patiently with a towel to dry them off!

28
00:01:21,370 --> 00:01:22,430
What a nice guy!

29
00:01:22,430 --> 00:01:24,470
Oh yeah, for sure! - and then when I'd have to lift something heavy like a table....

30
00:01:24,470 --> 00:01:26,270
...Michael would stand at the other end, and give me a hand picking it up!

31
00:01:29,470 --> 00:01:31,240
He's such great guy, and pretty handy that way!

32
00:01:31,580 --> 00:01:33,800
And then, when you had to make those tricky maneuvers with long items of furniture....

33
00:01:33,800 --> 00:01:36,130
...Michael would know exactly how far to back up before swerving!

34
00:01:36,580 --> 00:01:39,080
This one time, Michael backed so far up, it was just amazing!

35
00:01:40,520 --> 00:01:44,670
You just can't make sudden, sharp turns with those long tables, otherwise - BANG! - you'll end up banging your elbow against the wall, you know?

36
00:01:44,670 --> 00:01:47,590
Michael wouldn't do that - he'd go back all the way, and THEN make the turn!

37
00:01:49,360 --> 00:01:50,730
He really got it.

38
00:01:51,470 --> 00:01:53,540
That's when I realized just how supremely awesome the guy really was!!

39
00:01:54,200 --> 00:01:55,700
That IS pretty awesome!

40
00:01:56,740 --> 00:02:00,770
You wanna know something else? - we both have the same tastes, Michael and I!

41
00:02:00,770 --> 00:02:02,270
Absolutely, SPOT ON!

42
00:02:03,780 --> 00:02:04,380
You're a jackass!

43
00:02:04,380 --> 00:02:05,720
We even laugh at the same things!

44
00:02:07,140 --> 00:02:09,880
How come he laughs at everything you find funny?!

45
00:02:09,880 --> 00:02:13,840
Like, say for example, when you serve a bowl of hot miso soup, and then set it on the table....?

46
00:02:13,840 --> 00:02:16,120
....and the bowl starts to slide, and it makes that funny slipping sound sometimes?

47
00:02:16,120 --> 00:02:17,640
We just like totally crack up at that, Michael and I!

48
00:02:21,630 --> 00:02:24,360
And then he does that famous 'hoo-hoo-hooooo' yell!

49
00:02:25,100 --> 00:02:27,030
Oh yeah, it's a riot!
