1
00:00:00,560 --> 00:00:02,700
First ever Gaki No Tsukai Chiki Chiki

2
00:00:02,700 --> 00:00:05,240
100,000 yen prize Kushikatsu Tanaka marathon

3
00:00:05,240 --> 00:00:08,280
Tokyo 23 wards - 23 stores competition!

4
00:00:10,280 --> 00:00:11,920
Didn't understand a word you said

5
00:00:11,920 --> 00:00:13,560
C'mon, I said it very clearly

6
00:00:13,560 --> 00:00:15,640
This is the 6th eating marathon

7
00:00:15,460 --> 00:00:16,340
The 6th?

8
00:00:16,300 --> 00:00:18,880
Last time we did Ikinari Steak

9
00:00:18,880 --> 00:00:22,020
And at the 14th store out of 37,

10
00:00:22,020 --> 00:00:24,240
Unfortunately Hamada-san...

11
00:00:25,060 --> 00:00:29,060
In a nutshell, this is a segment where we get mad at Hamada

12
00:00:30,220 --> 00:00:36,000
A national chain restaurant where you can eat Osaka specialty Kushikatsu at the table

13
00:00:30,220 --> 00:00:36,000
TN: Kushikatsu is deep fried meat and vegetables on a skewer

14
00:00:36,000 --> 00:00:38,200
Kushikatsu Tanaka!

15
00:00:38,200 --> 00:00:45,060
The rules: From a menu of 34 items, each person has to eat 2 skewers

16
00:00:45,060 --> 00:00:47,060
From Tokyo's 23 wards

17
00:00:47,060 --> 00:00:52,220
they will visit a chain in each one, aiming to complete 23 stores

18
00:00:53,080 --> 00:00:55,760
We're counting on you, seriously, till the end

19
00:00:55,240 --> 00:00:58,580
No listen, last time I gave up cause I was thinking of you guys

20
00:00:58,600 --> 00:01:00,660
I want to hear the details, what do you mean?

21
00:01:00,660 --> 00:01:03,080
Matsumoto's face just looked so fed up

22
00:01:03,420 --> 00:01:06,360
Who cares what our faces looked like, right?

23
00:01:06,360 --> 00:01:09,100
I thought "I should stop this right here"

24
00:01:09,480 --> 00:01:10,880
I was reading the room

25
00:01:10,400 --> 00:01:12,520
You care this much for your partner?!

26
00:01:13,160 --> 00:01:17,080
A prize of 100,000 yen if they complete all 23 stores

27
00:01:17,080 --> 00:01:21,360
But the challenge ends if one person gives up

28
00:01:21,360 --> 00:01:29,720
And whoever gives up, has to pay for all the food eaten thus far
Will they be able to finish?

29
00:01:30,520 --> 00:01:37,480
Subbed by /u/senor_wristband

30
00:01:37,860 --> 00:01:40,460
Everyone, before we head to the first store,

31
00:01:40,460 --> 00:01:44,260
You will draw cards to see what Kushikatsu you will eat

32
00:01:44,260 --> 00:01:45,720
Wait, we don't pick?!

33
00:01:45,720 --> 00:01:46,720
Yes that's right

34
00:01:46,620 --> 00:01:47,400
What?

35
00:01:47,240 --> 00:01:48,820
From the line up-

36
00:01:48,520 --> 00:01:50,420
I can't eat the oysters

37
00:01:50,600 --> 00:01:51,480
Oysters?

38
00:01:51,480 --> 00:01:53,360
It's fried, so you'll be fine

39
00:01:53,640 --> 00:01:55,820
The raw ones are no good for you, right?

40
00:01:55,520 --> 00:01:58,400
The fried ones are no good either, umm, my doctor told me

41
00:01:58,400 --> 00:01:59,960
Your doctor?

42
00:02:00,400 --> 00:02:02,700
Hold on, what did you say?

43
00:02:02,700 --> 00:02:05,280
I can't eat oyster either

44
00:02:05,280 --> 00:02:07,280
I can't either

45
00:02:06,080 --> 00:02:08,620
So what if you two get oyster?

46
00:02:08,620 --> 00:02:10,580
Cause somebody's gotta eat it

47
00:02:09,960 --> 00:02:12,100
Someone needs to eat it,

48
00:02:12,100 --> 00:02:14,940
So we need to keep that in mind

49
00:02:15,020 --> 00:02:21,140
If Housei or Tanaka gets Oyster, they'll exchange with one of the other three members

50
00:02:21,800 --> 00:02:25,780
Deciding the first store's menu

51
00:02:25,780 --> 00:02:27,740
Starting from Hamada-san

52
00:02:30,020 --> 00:02:31,040
Huge, kinda

53
00:02:31,040 --> 00:02:32,120
Chicken Wing

54
00:02:32,120 --> 00:02:33,000
So big

55
00:02:32,200 --> 00:02:33,800
Chicken wings huh

56
00:02:33,820 --> 00:02:36,100
That, and ... Cheese

57
00:02:35,500 --> 00:02:37,380
Oh Cheese!

58
00:02:37,380 --> 00:02:39,480
Seems pretty easy

59
00:02:38,780 --> 00:02:40,160
How big are they?

60
00:02:40,160 --> 00:02:42,600
I've heard the wings are pretty large

61
00:02:42,600 --> 00:02:43,580
Oh really?

62
00:02:43,580 --> 00:02:45,200
Seriously?

63
00:02:44,100 --> 00:02:45,480
So Housei-san?

64
00:02:45,480 --> 00:02:47,380
Mine is, wah

65
00:02:48,640 --> 00:02:50,980
Kushikatsu, and ...

66
00:02:50,980 --> 00:02:52,260
Banana

67
00:02:52,140 --> 00:02:53,500
That's very nice

68
00:02:52,380 --> 00:02:54,360
You can eat that right?

69
00:02:53,240 --> 00:02:54,640
Bananana already?

70
00:02:54,300 --> 00:02:55,980
So the dessert is the main

71
00:02:55,880 --> 00:02:57,400
Yeah

72
00:02:57,780 --> 00:02:59,040
Matsumoto-san?

73
00:02:58,400 --> 00:03:00,640
I got, these are good

74
00:03:00,640 --> 00:03:02,140
Asparagus

75
00:03:01,260 --> 00:03:02,920
Asparagus is good, yeah?

76
00:03:02,940 --> 00:03:04,600
But the yam...

77
00:03:04,020 --> 00:03:05,380
That's no good

78
00:03:05,380 --> 00:03:07,380
A risky one

79
00:03:06,660 --> 00:03:07,800
So Asparagus and Yamaimo

80
00:03:09,100 --> 00:03:12,360
Then Endo got Pork Shiso and Clam,

81
00:03:12,360 --> 00:03:15,440
And Tanka got Shishito pepper and Ginan (Ginko Seed)

82
00:03:15,440 --> 00:03:17,920
Wait so you can't eat fried Oyster?

83
00:03:17,920 --> 00:03:19,920
Oysters are just, no good

84
00:03:21,540 --> 00:03:23,120
Oysters are no good right?

85
00:03:22,320 --> 00:03:24,360
The taste of oyster ...

86
00:03:24,360 --> 00:03:25,600
You don't like it

87
00:03:24,720 --> 00:03:26,720
I got sick once

88
00:03:26,720 --> 00:03:29,060
But it wasn't fried oyster right that got you

89
00:03:29,060 --> 00:03:30,160
It was a raw one right?

90
00:03:30,160 --> 00:03:31,260
It was raw

91
00:03:30,840 --> 00:03:31,680
Right

92
00:03:31,120 --> 00:03:33,240
Yeah and this is fried

93
00:03:32,100 --> 00:03:34,300
Yeah but still ... it's scary

94
00:03:35,200 --> 00:03:36,400
That sort of thing

95
00:03:35,780 --> 00:03:39,960
That sort of thing getting you scared is unacceptable

96
00:03:39,300 --> 00:03:41,260
But it really sucks when you get sick

97
00:03:40,580 --> 00:03:42,920
I've gotten sick too, so many times

98
00:03:42,500 --> 00:03:44,340
That was raw

99
00:03:43,440 --> 00:03:44,940
No way

100
00:03:43,900 --> 00:03:45,180
It's true

101
00:03:45,180 --> 00:03:48,220
I think oysters have gotten me sick the most

102
00:03:47,160 --> 00:03:48,520
How many times?

103
00:03:48,520 --> 00:03:50,520
Like 7 - 8 times seriously

104
00:03:50,520 --> 00:03:52,520
That means you're a goddamn moron!

105
00:03:51,600 --> 00:03:52,960
They were raw though

106
00:03:52,960 --> 00:03:57,160
Seriously, getting sick that many times and still eating it.
That pisses you off right?

107
00:03:56,860 --> 00:03:58,720
Who would get pissed off?

108
00:03:57,820 --> 00:03:58,660
Right?

109
00:03:59,680 --> 00:04:02,900
What's with you today, you're so abrasive

110
00:04:02,900 --> 00:04:04,900
Right? He sort of is

111
00:04:07,020 --> 00:04:09,520
Being so abrasive

112
00:04:08,020 --> 00:04:09,520
Cut it out

113
00:04:09,520 --> 00:04:15,640
The first location, in Kagurazaka

114
00:04:15,640 --> 00:04:20,000
So you'll get the two skewers from your cards

115
00:04:16,780 --> 00:04:18,180
Got it

116
00:04:19,300 --> 00:04:20,160
Yup

117
00:04:20,160 --> 00:04:23,240
Since you're all from Kansai region you might probably know this,

118
00:04:23,240 --> 00:04:25,240
Double dipping is not allowed,

119
00:04:24,720 --> 00:04:25,660
Of course, of course

120
00:04:25,660 --> 00:04:28,320
Second dip use the cabbage to get sauce

121
00:04:27,660 --> 00:04:28,440
Yeah

122
00:04:28,440 --> 00:04:29,780
We all knew that I guess

123
00:04:28,780 --> 00:04:31,360
There's also a side menu

124
00:04:31,360 --> 00:04:33,280
So whoever wants something can pay for it

125
00:04:32,160 --> 00:04:33,980
Who the hell would order something

126
00:04:33,280 --> 00:04:35,220
But first-

127
00:04:33,480 --> 00:04:35,120
Excuse me

128
00:04:35,120 --> 00:04:38,260
This is Asparagus, Yam, Clam,

129
00:04:38,260 --> 00:04:40,420
Pork Shiko, and Chicken Wing

130
00:04:40,400 --> 00:04:43,700
This here is Bandana, Ginaan,

131
00:04:43,700 --> 00:04:45,700
Cheese, and Shishito

132
00:04:46,820 --> 00:04:50,180
So you can have the Asparagus with sauce or mayo,

133
00:04:50,180 --> 00:04:52,540
For the Banaan, if you like,

134
00:04:52,540 --> 00:04:54,980
you can enjoy it with this chocolate sauce

135
00:04:55,020 --> 00:04:56,120
Okie Dokie

136
00:04:55,560 --> 00:04:56,840
And this?

137
00:04:55,900 --> 00:04:56,880
And that?

138
00:04:57,360 --> 00:04:58,480
Pork

139
00:04:58,480 --> 00:05:00,120
So soon, Hamada-san

140
00:05:00,120 --> 00:05:01,860
It's good

141
00:05:01,860 --> 00:05:04,080
It's not as big as you guys think

142
00:05:04,080 --> 00:05:05,800
You can go for it?

143
00:05:05,500 --> 00:05:06,880
Itadakimasu

144
00:05:08,220 --> 00:05:11,160
Curry sauce would be good too

145
00:05:10,260 --> 00:05:11,380
It's tasty

146
00:05:11,300 --> 00:05:12,680
Sauce is tasty too

147
00:05:14,280 --> 00:05:15,400
Tashty, tashty

148
00:05:15,400 --> 00:05:19,880
It's kind of annoying we can't dip the Asparagus twice

149
00:05:20,520 --> 00:05:23,360
This from one dip, right?

150
00:05:23,760 --> 00:05:25,680
The asparagus is big

151
00:05:25,680 --> 00:05:26,600
The size

152
00:05:28,040 --> 00:05:29,620
I can dig into this

153
00:05:30,080 --> 00:05:31,240
You can dig in yeah

154
00:05:30,960 --> 00:05:32,020
Absolutely

155
00:05:32,020 --> 00:05:34,680
Wouldn't Babana taste better with chocolate sauce?

156
00:05:34,680 --> 00:05:36,680
Should I be using it?

157
00:05:35,980 --> 00:05:38,220
It's up to you,

158
00:05:38,220 --> 00:05:40,360
Maybe just try it

159
00:05:40,940 --> 00:05:42,580
I'll try as is

160
00:05:44,160 --> 00:05:45,360
How is it?

161
00:05:45,360 --> 00:05:46,880
Oh, it's tasty

162
00:05:46,880 --> 00:05:48,460
I can totally eat this

163
00:05:48,900 --> 00:05:50,580
Without chocolate?

164
00:05:50,580 --> 00:05:52,120
It's already sweet

165
00:05:52,700 --> 00:05:53,840
You gobbled that up

166
00:05:53,840 --> 00:05:55,720
Tanaka-san is quick

167
00:05:55,300 --> 00:05:56,680
Easy, this is easy

168
00:05:57,300 --> 00:06:00,560
The other members finish one after another

169
00:06:00,560 --> 00:06:02,560
Hamda-san is done too

170
00:06:02,560 --> 00:06:05,220
Eh, the sauce, on the Banana?

171
00:06:03,540 --> 00:06:04,760
Hold on

172
00:06:05,140 --> 00:06:06,700
Not the chocolate?

173
00:06:06,700 --> 00:06:08,400
It's sweet, too sweet

174
00:06:08,400 --> 00:06:10,100
The banana

175
00:06:12,880 --> 00:06:14,260
Is it sweet?

176
00:06:17,900 --> 00:06:19,260
Does it go together?

177
00:06:19,260 --> 00:06:20,700
It really doesn't

178
00:06:20,820 --> 00:06:22,540
In the end it tastes bad

179
00:06:21,920 --> 00:06:23,260
In the end

180
00:06:24,560 --> 00:06:27,740
Excuse me, I'm done

181
00:06:26,300 --> 00:06:27,240
Alright

182
00:06:27,160 --> 00:06:29,800
The first store is cleared!

183
00:06:30,800 --> 00:06:32,580
It was easy huh?

184
00:06:31,760 --> 00:06:32,780
Piece of cake

185
00:06:32,780 --> 00:06:35,820
Finished before they realised, on to the next store

186
00:06:36,460 --> 00:06:39,840
Deciding the menu before heading over,

187
00:06:39,580 --> 00:06:44,850
Asparagus

188
00:06:39,580 --> 00:06:44,850
Banana

189
00:06:39,580 --> 00:06:44,850
Eggplant

190
00:06:39,580 --> 00:06:44,850
Monaka (Mochi Wafer)

191
00:06:39,580 --> 00:06:44,850
Nitamago (Ramen Egg)

192
00:06:39,580 --> 00:06:44,850
Shrimp

193
00:06:39,580 --> 00:06:44,850
Tomato

194
00:06:39,580 --> 00:06:44,850
Tsukune (Chicken)

195
00:06:40,620 --> 00:06:44,300
Everyone but Tanaka got the following

196
00:06:44,500 --> 00:06:47,520
Tanaka's menu?

197
00:06:47,520 --> 00:06:50,900
Pollock roe, and ... oyster

198
00:06:48,440 --> 00:06:49,880
Pollock Roe?

199
00:06:49,360 --> 00:06:51,280
Oyster!

200
00:06:50,880 --> 00:06:52,440
How do we deal with this

201
00:06:51,480 --> 00:06:52,440
How do we deal with this

202
00:06:52,780 --> 00:06:54,000
No helping it

203
00:06:54,000 --> 00:06:56,800
If Hamada-san has one he wants to swap,

204
00:06:56,800 --> 00:06:58,800
I will swap one also

205
00:06:57,540 --> 00:07:00,040
I'll swap the Banana with you

206
00:06:58,440 --> 00:07:01,360
So Hamada-san is swapping Banana, Matsumoto-san?

207
00:07:00,820 --> 00:07:02,360
The Tsukune

208
00:07:01,660 --> 00:07:03,580
I want to swap the asparagus

209
00:07:05,740 --> 00:07:06,940
Asparagus?

210
00:07:07,400 --> 00:07:08,680
...yes

211
00:07:08,580 --> 00:07:09,700
Why

212
00:07:09,700 --> 00:07:11,700
Downtown-san, both of them...

213
00:07:10,620 --> 00:07:12,900
Why did you two react like that

214
00:07:12,900 --> 00:07:16,340
I don't understand a man who would trade asparagus

215
00:07:16,340 --> 00:07:19,620
You made Downtown-san go "WHAT?!" so loudly

216
00:07:19,100 --> 00:07:20,880
Tanaka what will you do?

217
00:07:19,620 --> 00:07:22,280
I will, after all, sorry, ummmm

218
00:07:22,280 --> 00:07:24,760
I'll go for the asparagus

219
00:07:25,780 --> 00:07:28,320
So Endo-san has egg and oyster

220
00:07:27,340 --> 00:07:29,300
I will take his oyster

221
00:07:28,320 --> 00:07:29,660
You've really helped me out

222
00:07:30,180 --> 00:07:34,480
The 2nd store, the Edogawabashi location

223
00:07:34,460 --> 00:07:35,880
They're ready

224
00:07:35,320 --> 00:07:36,900
That was quick

225
00:07:36,200 --> 00:07:37,820
Brilliant

226
00:07:39,480 --> 00:07:41,360
That looks big

227
00:07:42,240 --> 00:07:43,420
Hmm?

228
00:07:44,120 --> 00:07:50,320
So this is Eggplant, Banana, Shrimp, Tsukune, and Tomato

229
00:07:50,320 --> 00:07:52,440
Those two are huge

230
00:07:52,440 --> 00:07:53,740
You're right

231
00:07:53,080 --> 00:07:54,480
Really big portions

232
00:07:53,520 --> 00:07:56,300
The size of the Eggplant and Banana...

233
00:07:56,620 --> 00:07:58,500
You greedy bastard

234
00:07:58,840 --> 00:08:00,840
Hamada-san has a lot

235
00:08:01,800 --> 00:08:08,100
The Banana and Eggplant aside, comparing everything to a wiener, everything is a large size

236
00:08:08,100 --> 00:08:12,660
Finishing just one will be quite a task on its own

237
00:08:13,620 --> 00:08:15,820
Eggplant

238
00:08:14,780 --> 00:08:16,800
Matsumoto-san has good ones

239
00:08:16,680 --> 00:08:18,980
I can dig into this easily

240
00:08:21,240 --> 00:08:24,100
The pollock roe is a small portion

241
00:08:24,800 --> 00:08:26,260
How is it?

242
00:08:26,260 --> 00:08:28,260
It's good ... huge though

243
00:08:29,680 --> 00:08:31,620
It is tasty though

244
00:08:33,420 --> 00:08:34,940
So hot

245
00:08:36,820 --> 00:08:37,880
Tasty

246
00:08:38,300 --> 00:08:39,520
The Monaka?

247
00:08:39,820 --> 00:08:41,120
Straight up delicious

248
00:08:40,700 --> 00:08:42,260
Totally

249
00:08:42,260 --> 00:08:43,560
So good

250
00:08:43,060 --> 00:08:43,860
It's good?

251
00:08:43,420 --> 00:08:44,780
It's so good

252
00:08:44,780 --> 00:08:46,200
No sauce or anything

253
00:08:46,300 --> 00:08:47,740
It's good by itself

254
00:08:47,240 --> 00:08:48,940
How's the ramen egg, Endo-san?

255
00:08:49,320 --> 00:08:50,980
Tasty, it's tasty

256
00:08:50,260 --> 00:08:51,940
You're shoveling that down

257
00:08:51,400 --> 00:08:53,560
It is pretty heavy though

258
00:08:54,560 --> 00:08:56,440
I can't handle this

259
00:08:58,960 --> 00:09:01,240
He means cause it's so tasty

260
00:09:01,980 --> 00:09:05,020
Half the Banana would be good

261
00:09:05,560 --> 00:09:08,900
But still, it seems like everyone is really digging in

262
00:09:12,040 --> 00:09:13,800
This guy is so slow

263
00:09:13,800 --> 00:09:17,260
The guy with the Banana will definitely take the longest time

264
00:09:18,080 --> 00:09:20,220
Like Hosei-san earlier

265
00:09:20,220 --> 00:09:22,120
It's pretty hot inside

266
00:09:22,120 --> 00:09:24,120
The eggplant is hot too right?

267
00:09:23,840 --> 00:09:25,480
Yeah exactly

268
00:09:27,140 --> 00:09:29,000
He's finished!

269
00:09:31,840 --> 00:09:35,380
Deciding the menu for the third store,

270
00:09:35,360 --> 00:09:37,040
Endo-san?

271
00:09:35,780 --> 00:09:37,680
Tsukune, and ...

272
00:09:37,680 --> 00:09:39,680
something something Dengaku

273
00:09:38,620 --> 00:09:43,640
TN: Namafu seems to be like a wheat gluten mochi

274
00:09:38,680 --> 00:09:41,520
It's Namafu, you can't read it?

275
00:09:41,520 --> 00:09:43,520
It's Namafu Dengaku

276
00:09:41,980 --> 00:09:43,460
What, you're joking

277
00:09:43,460 --> 00:09:45,460
You can see what it says right away

278
00:09:46,120 --> 00:09:48,120
... something something Dengaku

279
00:09:49,040 --> 00:09:52,060
I've never learned these words

280
00:09:52,240 --> 00:09:57,920
Ham Cutlet                     Quail

281
00:09:52,240 --> 00:09:57,920
Hanpen                  Shitake

282
00:09:52,240 --> 00:09:57,920
Lotus Root                  Mochi

283
00:09:52,240 --> 00:09:57,920
Namafu Dengaku               Tsukune

284
00:09:52,240 --> 00:09:57,920
Tomato                 Monaka

285
00:09:52,360 --> 00:09:54,480
This is what the other members got,

286
00:09:54,480 --> 00:09:58,020
This time the sizes are easier to eat

287
00:09:58,020 --> 00:10:00,240
But you've had Namafu before though?

288
00:09:59,740 --> 00:10:01,060
I haven't

289
00:10:03,260 --> 00:10:05,200
.... I've never eaten it before

290
00:10:05,420 --> 00:10:07,520
You definitley have

291
00:10:07,700 --> 00:10:09,940
Even if you haven't eaten it before,

292
00:10:09,940 --> 00:10:12,540
you should have at least read those words before

293
00:10:13,140 --> 00:10:14,620
It's a different problem

294
00:10:16,300 --> 00:10:20,640
The next store is the Suidobashi location

295
00:10:22,580 --> 00:10:24,000
Thank you

296
00:10:24,940 --> 00:10:28,060
The Namafu has sweet miso on it, please try it as it is

297
00:10:29,360 --> 00:10:31,300
This is hot too

298
00:10:30,640 --> 00:10:33,440
Shitake

299
00:10:30,920 --> 00:10:32,120
It's hot?

300
00:10:32,280 --> 00:10:33,800
But still...

301
00:10:41,900 --> 00:10:43,900
Tasty, the Ham Cutlets are good

302
00:10:43,100 --> 00:10:44,780
Ham Cutlets look delicious

303
00:10:45,140 --> 00:10:46,100
Endo-san

304
00:10:46,100 --> 00:10:47,480
Endo-san, the Namafu

305
00:10:46,600 --> 00:10:48,280
This is Namafu

306
00:10:47,820 --> 00:10:49,620
This is?

307
00:10:49,620 --> 00:10:51,260
Without dipping in sauce right?

308
00:10:51,260 --> 00:10:53,080
I think you would've eaten this before

309
00:10:52,400 --> 00:10:53,940
You've seen it before right?

310
00:10:53,520 --> 00:10:55,280
No it's my first time seeing this

311
00:10:56,020 --> 00:10:58,420
There are no people like you Endo

312
00:11:01,260 --> 00:11:02,240
How is it?

313
00:11:01,620 --> 00:11:02,880
Oh, it's good

314
00:11:02,780 --> 00:11:04,160
Eaten it before?

315
00:11:03,300 --> 00:11:04,340
Nah I haven't

316
00:11:04,340 --> 00:11:05,680
What, really?

317
00:11:05,160 --> 00:11:06,660
My first time

318
00:11:06,660 --> 00:11:08,060
Seriously?

319
00:11:09,060 --> 00:11:13,360
The 5 are merrily finishing their kushikatsu

320
00:11:15,940 --> 00:11:18,040
I can totally dig into this

321
00:11:16,600 --> 00:11:19,460
Mochi

322
00:11:22,540 --> 00:11:27,000
They're still commenting that this challenge is easy
Time for the next menu

323
00:11:27,320 --> 00:11:29,760
Hamada got Spring Onion and Onion

324
00:11:27,540 --> 00:11:33,000
Asparagus

325
00:11:27,540 --> 00:11:33,000
Ham Cutlet

326
00:11:27,540 --> 00:11:33,000
Shitake

327
00:11:27,540 --> 00:11:33,000
Yamaimo (Yam)

328
00:11:29,760 --> 00:11:32,240
Matsumoto got Mochi and Namafu Dengaku

329
00:11:33,720 --> 00:11:36,000
And Tanaka's items?

330
00:11:36,200 --> 00:11:38,940
Osaka Specialty, Beni Shoga

331
00:11:36,200 --> 00:11:38,940
TN: Pickled Ginger Root

332
00:11:37,720 --> 00:11:38,940
It appeared!

333
00:11:39,340 --> 00:11:40,480
Finally!

334
00:11:40,040 --> 00:11:41,560
Osaka specialty, and ...

335
00:11:41,560 --> 00:11:43,120
... Oyster!

336
00:11:43,040 --> 00:11:44,680
There's the Oyster

337
00:11:44,320 --> 00:11:46,920
You keep on getting that

338
00:11:46,560 --> 00:11:49,180
Does anyone want to swap with my Oyster?

339
00:11:48,460 --> 00:11:49,800
For the Mochi, absolutley,

340
00:11:49,400 --> 00:11:50,440
Oh for the Mochi?

341
00:11:50,440 --> 00:11:51,620
Mochi is uh.......

342
00:11:52,480 --> 00:11:53,700
The worst,

343
00:11:53,940 --> 00:11:55,520
This guy is the worst

344
00:11:55,520 --> 00:11:57,980
You're turning me down?!

345
00:11:57,280 --> 00:11:59,900
It's up to him

346
00:11:59,880 --> 00:12:01,160
The Ham Cutlet!

347
00:12:00,920 --> 00:12:02,080
Ah Endo-san's

348
00:12:00,920 --> 00:12:02,240
Again?

349
00:12:02,240 --> 00:12:06,360
In the end, Tanaka switches his Oyster with Endo's Ham Cutlet

350
00:12:06,540 --> 00:12:10,160
I'm not sure we've solved the Oyster problem

351
00:12:09,320 --> 00:12:11,140
Yeah the rules...

352
00:12:11,640 --> 00:12:14,560
Let's decide on something then?

353
00:12:14,560 --> 00:12:16,140
Ah! I got it!

354
00:12:16,140 --> 00:12:17,960
Just pull two cards

355
00:12:17,100 --> 00:12:18,180
2 cards 1 person?

356
00:12:18,180 --> 00:12:20,800
I mean like ... an alternative to the Oyster

357
00:12:18,400 --> 00:12:22,720
If those two get Oyster, they will eat 3 items

358
00:12:20,260 --> 00:12:21,660
Ahhh 2 cards for that

359
00:12:21,300 --> 00:12:22,940
So 3 items in total

360
00:12:22,140 --> 00:12:23,000
3 items

361
00:12:23,000 --> 00:12:24,900
Let's do that, it's the best solution

362
00:12:25,160 --> 00:12:26,800
Take another card then!

363
00:12:27,640 --> 00:12:28,620
I see

364
00:12:28,340 --> 00:12:29,440
No no no, that's-

365
00:12:29,440 --> 00:12:31,320
That rule is for next time

366
00:12:31,320 --> 00:12:35,460
There's plenty of time before we arrive there, like 20 minutes

367
00:12:34,240 --> 00:12:35,780
That much time?

368
00:12:35,060 --> 00:12:37,040
Ok then take another card

369
00:12:37,040 --> 00:12:39,020
The odds are amazing here

370
00:12:39,020 --> 00:12:40,600
If you get the same thing again

371
00:12:40,640 --> 00:12:42,700
You'll go from 3 items to 4

372
00:12:42,700 --> 00:12:44,180
Wiener!

373
00:12:44,900 --> 00:12:47,060
What's with that triumphant tone?!

374
00:12:47,060 --> 00:12:49,040
"WIENER!!  :^D"

375
00:12:49,040 --> 00:12:51,460
Like, like he won a prize or something

376
00:12:51,460 --> 00:12:55,940
It's like, his triumph over the villains at the end of the story

377
00:12:56,420 --> 00:12:59,420
Like we're super evil guys or something

378
00:12:58,920 --> 00:12:59,960
"WEENAH! 8^D"

379
00:12:59,960 --> 00:13:01,540
"WEEENAH!! ~(˘A˘~)"

380
00:13:01,040 --> 00:13:02,860
It's not like that at all

381
00:13:02,140 --> 00:13:04,440
He exclaimed "WIENER!" didn't he?

382
00:13:04,440 --> 00:13:05,640
It's not like that

383
00:13:05,920 --> 00:13:07,320
Like he won

384
00:13:07,700 --> 00:13:12,880
So Tanaka will have Beni Shoga, Ham Cutlet, and Wiener to finish

385
00:13:13,240 --> 00:13:17,740
The 4th store in Arakawa Ward, the Nishinippori location

386
00:13:18,160 --> 00:13:19,740
Tanaka-san if you will,

387
00:13:19,740 --> 00:13:21,740
He gets it separately

388
00:13:21,740 --> 00:13:23,600
3, for the first time

389
00:13:23,600 --> 00:13:24,960
Three, three huh

390
00:13:24,620 --> 00:13:26,820
Cause you kept going on about the Oyster,

391
00:13:26,820 --> 00:13:30,000
This is like God's wrath

392
00:13:28,600 --> 00:13:30,840
I don't think this is God's wrath

393
00:13:31,400 --> 00:13:33,120
But still this is ...

394
00:13:32,220 --> 00:13:39,730
Beni Shoga

395
00:13:35,220 --> 00:13:37,420
Hamada-san's is huge huh?

396
00:13:36,820 --> 00:13:38,400
Right?

397
00:13:38,060 --> 00:13:40,220
Beni Shoga is delicious!

398
00:13:39,920 --> 00:13:41,580
Yeah Beni Shoga is good

399
00:13:41,580 --> 00:13:43,420
Beni Shoga is nice yeah

400
00:13:43,220 --> 00:13:44,640
That looks tasty

401
00:13:44,400 --> 00:13:45,840
I can totally dig in

402
00:13:45,540 --> 00:13:46,800
You can go for it?

403
00:13:46,940 --> 00:13:49,300
This is really good, the Namafu

404
00:13:55,180 --> 00:13:56,960
Ah it's not what I expected

405
00:13:56,060 --> 00:13:57,280
Ah, it's not?

406
00:13:57,880 --> 00:13:59,580
You're kinda slow aren't you?

407
00:13:59,860 --> 00:14:01,700
No I can eat it, but

408
00:14:01,700 --> 00:14:04,480
But the portion is kinda big

409
00:14:04,480 --> 00:14:06,200
Ah, what is that?

410
00:14:06,720 --> 00:14:08,040
Yamaimo

411
00:14:07,420 --> 00:14:08,840
Yamaimo?

412
00:14:08,840 --> 00:14:10,780
The Onion is huge huh?

413
00:14:13,500 --> 00:14:19,560
Big portion sizes, but they still gorfle it down lickity split

414
00:14:19,860 --> 00:14:21,780
That looked easy for you Hamada-san

415
00:14:21,780 --> 00:14:23,780
Yeah I guess

416
00:14:25,000 --> 00:14:27,720
Then they decide the 5th menu,

417
00:14:28,250 --> 00:14:33,320
Chicken Wing                                  Wiener

418
00:14:28,250 --> 00:14:33,320
Hanpen                                       Liver Cutlet

419
00:14:28,250 --> 00:14:33,320
Monaka                                       Oyster

420
00:14:28,250 --> 00:14:33,320
Shishito                                       Ginnan

421
00:14:28,250 --> 00:14:33,320
Spring Onion                        Namafu Dengaku

422
00:14:28,840 --> 00:14:33,000
Tanaka got Spring Onion, will he be okay with the size?

423
00:14:33,560 --> 00:14:35,540
So Tanaka? Are you full after eating 3?

424
00:14:35,540 --> 00:14:37,540
No I'm still fine

425
00:14:37,700 --> 00:14:39,560
How full are you?

426
00:14:39,820 --> 00:14:41,780
How are you? Still easy right?

427
00:14:41,780 --> 00:14:44,160
I'm still, totally fine

428
00:14:42,660 --> 00:14:44,260
Totally fine

429
00:14:45,100 --> 00:14:47,220
But last time, what was it,

430
00:14:47,220 --> 00:14:49,760
At Ikininari Steak you were already full, right?

431
00:14:49,760 --> 00:14:51,760
By the 4th store

432
00:14:51,000 --> 00:14:51,900
Yes, yes

433
00:14:51,900 --> 00:14:54,300
You were already done by the 4th store?

434
00:14:53,220 --> 00:14:54,340
By the 3rd store

435
00:14:54,340 --> 00:14:56,100
Really?
That soon?

436
00:14:56,060 --> 00:14:57,960
I was on the edge

437
00:14:57,040 --> 00:14:58,800
On the edge?

438
00:15:00,320 --> 00:15:06,640
Kushikatsu Tanaka Marathon; 5th store in Taito Ward, Asakusabashi location

439
00:15:06,760 --> 00:15:08,140
Chilly

440
00:15:07,820 --> 00:15:08,980
Yeah

441
00:15:09,260 --> 00:15:10,480
Okay!

442
00:15:10,480 --> 00:15:13,860
Shall we play some Chinchirorin? (Cee-lo)

443
00:15:11,960 --> 00:15:13,820
Let's do it!

444
00:15:11,960 --> 00:15:13,820
Okay!

445
00:15:13,820 --> 00:15:15,280
Chinchirorin!

446
00:15:15,280 --> 00:15:19,180
Kushikatsu Tanaka attraction; Chinchirorin High Ball!

447
00:15:19,600 --> 00:15:24,680
If you roll doubles, you get one highball!

448
00:15:24,680 --> 00:15:28,540
An even roll gets you half price

449
00:15:28,900 --> 00:15:33,280
An odd roll gets you a double size Mega Jug!

450
00:15:33,280 --> 00:15:36,180
Matsumoto will play this game

451
00:15:36,180 --> 00:15:38,960
What outcome will show off my talent power?

452
00:15:38,580 --> 00:15:40,440
Doubles
Doubles of course

453
00:15:40,160 --> 00:15:41,280
Doubles,

454
00:15:41,280 --> 00:15:43,840
If I get two 1's that'll show my talent power

455
00:15:42,840 --> 00:15:48,540
Observe

456
00:15:45,040 --> 00:15:46,120
Here I go

457
00:15:46,120 --> 00:15:47,480
Seriously

458
00:15:47,480 --> 00:15:48,860
two 1's

459
00:15:48,420 --> 00:15:50,180
Two 1's would be amazing

460
00:15:50,060 --> 00:15:52,280
Hold on, I can hear some yawning

461
00:15:52,180 --> 00:15:53,380
Yawning?

462
00:15:53,980 --> 00:15:57,020
Just when I'm about to display my talent power,

463
00:15:57,020 --> 00:16:00,000
My partner is yawning off to the side?

464
00:16:00,680 --> 00:16:03,420
This is diminishing my talent power for sure

465
00:16:02,920 --> 00:16:04,740
No you'll be fine

466
00:16:04,740 --> 00:16:05,900
Here I go, for real

467
00:16:09,460 --> 00:16:12,540
Six and Five - That's an odd roll

468
00:16:12,540 --> 00:16:14,780
A Mega Jug!

469
00:16:13,780 --> 00:16:15,780
Okay! Talent Power!

470
00:16:15,240 --> 00:16:16,800
There it is

471
00:16:16,640 --> 00:16:18,560
I got an interesting outcome!

472
00:16:19,680 --> 00:16:22,460
So interesting.....

473
00:16:23,060 --> 00:16:27,180
Before the Mega Jug highball, it's time for Kushikatsu

474
00:16:27,820 --> 00:16:29,920
This spring onion is huge

475
00:16:29,580 --> 00:16:31,840
Damn that is huge

476
00:16:34,800 --> 00:16:36,400
Finally

477
00:16:34,980 --> 00:16:37,640
It's big, and also heavy

478
00:16:37,640 --> 00:16:38,860
Very heavy

479
00:16:38,480 --> 00:16:39,540
The weight too?

480
00:16:39,040 --> 00:16:40,180
Yes

481
00:16:39,520 --> 00:16:41,810
Your highball sir

482
00:16:40,180 --> 00:16:41,960
Huge!

483
00:16:40,300 --> 00:16:41,680
It's here Matsumoto-san

484
00:16:41,960 --> 00:16:43,640
So big!

485
00:16:42,920 --> 00:16:44,180
It's here

486
00:16:44,440 --> 00:16:46,960
The chinchirorin prize

487
00:16:46,960 --> 00:16:48,420
Wait hold on

488
00:16:47,280 --> 00:16:48,560
Cause you got odd

489
00:16:48,720 --> 00:16:50,900
Nobody else is doing chinchirorin?

490
00:16:50,900 --> 00:16:52,420
Any others?

491
00:16:52,420 --> 00:16:53,200
Right?

492
00:16:53,860 --> 00:16:56,020
Talent power ...

493
00:16:55,060 --> 00:16:56,820
He ignored you

494
00:16:56,960 --> 00:16:59,600
So freaking huge huh?

495
00:17:01,780 --> 00:17:05,260
Still I think it's good have a little bit

496
00:17:05,260 --> 00:17:12,180
The still easy going 5 have eaten their 10th skewers!

497
00:17:09,540 --> 00:17:13,460
5th Store Complete!

498
00:17:14,180 --> 00:17:16,960
With this everyone has eaten 10,
Tanaka-san 11

499
00:17:18,140 --> 00:17:20,020
I can still eat

500
00:17:21,020 --> 00:17:24,700
The 5 are in good spirits; The next menu?

501
00:17:24,700 --> 00:17:25,780
Hosei-san?

502
00:17:25,160 --> 00:17:26,600
Ah, Garlic!

503
00:17:26,220 --> 00:17:28,180
Oh, first time someone's got that

504
00:17:27,340 --> 00:17:28,500
That, and ...

505
00:17:28,500 --> 00:17:30,600
There it is, there's the Spring Onion

506
00:17:30,600 --> 00:17:31,900
There it is

507
00:17:31,900 --> 00:17:33,900
That thing is huge

508
00:17:33,200 --> 00:17:36,580
Why do you have such a foul expression?

509
00:17:36,080 --> 00:17:37,900
That is pretty rude actually

510
00:17:38,380 --> 00:17:40,160
OK, so Tanaka-san,

511
00:17:40,060 --> 00:17:41,360
Quail

512
00:17:40,440 --> 00:17:41,520
Quail

513
00:17:41,520 --> 00:17:43,800
Wait a second I got Oyster again ...

514
00:17:43,520 --> 00:17:46,040
You keep getting that ...

515
00:17:44,780 --> 00:17:46,320
Seriously?

516
00:17:46,500 --> 00:17:49,260
So that means, 3 alternates for you

517
00:17:48,800 --> 00:17:50,760
Oh, really?

518
00:17:49,220 --> 00:17:50,440
Yes

519
00:17:49,600 --> 00:17:51,400
3 of them

520
00:17:51,400 --> 00:17:52,660
Ah man

521
00:17:53,000 --> 00:17:56,980
TN: Apologies, I might not be translating this line correctly

522
00:17:53,000 --> 00:17:56,980
You are like an Oyster magent

523
00:18:00,400 --> 00:18:03,620
After that, the two cards he pulled?

524
00:18:03,620 --> 00:18:06,800
He will have Quail, Pollock Roe, and Cheese

525
00:18:06,800 --> 00:18:09,240
Hamada; Nitamago (Ramen Egg), and Liver Cutlet

526
00:18:09,240 --> 00:18:11,420
Matsumoto: Yamimo and Beef Kushikatsu

527
00:18:11,420 --> 00:18:14,300
Endo: Chicken Wing and Tomato

528
00:18:14,460 --> 00:18:17,520
Does anyone want to play Chinchirorin at the next store?

529
00:18:17,520 --> 00:18:19,520
Uh Yamasaki-san wants to

530
00:18:18,860 --> 00:18:19,540
No no no

531
00:18:19,540 --> 00:18:20,320
Hosei-san?

532
00:18:19,780 --> 00:18:20,300
No no

533
00:18:20,320 --> 00:18:21,360
No no

534
00:18:21,360 --> 00:18:24,900
Looking at Tanaka last time, I don't want to be like him

535
00:18:25,080 --> 00:18:27,440
A face full of despair

536
00:18:27,020 --> 00:18:29,240
I was just feeling sick that day,

537
00:18:29,240 --> 00:18:31,720
It didn't have anything to do with Sake

538
00:18:30,620 --> 00:18:32,220
But still,

539
00:18:32,220 --> 00:18:34,440
It'll be like I'm in a Hell-Zone

540
00:18:34,980 --> 00:18:37,640
Hell-Zone...

541
00:18:38,280 --> 00:18:42,320
Should we do a Hell-Zone contest,
whoever can say it the scariest

542
00:18:42,320 --> 00:18:43,740
Oh yeah

543
00:18:43,740 --> 00:18:45,440
Starting from who?

544
00:18:45,320 --> 00:18:47,160
I'll go, Hell-Zone

545
00:18:46,540 --> 00:18:48,300
Do it super scary

546
00:18:47,600 --> 00:18:48,840
What do we say?

547
00:18:48,620 --> 00:18:50,020
Hell-Zone

548
00:18:48,620 --> 00:18:50,020
Hell-Zone

549
00:18:49,680 --> 00:18:51,760
The words Hell-Zone?

550
00:18:50,940 --> 00:18:53,700
Here I go

551
00:18:56,360 --> 00:18:58,220
You're so quiet

552
00:18:59,340 --> 00:19:01,600
It's not scary then

553
00:19:00,880 --> 00:19:01,940
Ah, really?

554
00:19:01,940 --> 00:19:03,680
Who's next?

555
00:19:03,380 --> 00:19:04,660
Then...

556
00:19:04,120 --> 00:19:04,980
I'll go

557
00:19:07,280 --> 00:19:08,660
Here I go

558
00:19:10,500 --> 00:19:12,780
Wait a second please

559
00:19:12,800 --> 00:19:14,960
The banging

560
00:19:16,660 --> 00:19:18,940
It kept getting louder all of a sudden

561
00:19:21,160 --> 00:19:23,120
That's a wrap

562
00:19:22,380 --> 00:19:24,340
Not like he can do it now

563
00:19:25,460 --> 00:19:28,240
That was the beginning and the end

564
00:19:29,480 --> 00:19:30,820
Only for that moment

565
00:19:32,260 --> 00:19:37,900
Kushikatsu Tanaka 6th store; In Sumida Ward, Ryogoku location

566
00:19:38,300 --> 00:19:44,530
Liver Cutlet

567
00:19:38,800 --> 00:19:39,960
Okay

568
00:19:39,640 --> 00:19:42,060
I'm gonna dig in

569
00:19:40,720 --> 00:19:42,180
Okie dokes

570
00:19:44,820 --> 00:19:46,360
I can totally dig in

571
00:19:46,740 --> 00:19:48,560
Woahhh, that's nice

572
00:19:48,560 --> 00:19:51,240
The size right? It's Nitamago after all

573
00:19:50,760 --> 00:19:53,820
Like Humpty Dumpty

574
00:19:57,160 --> 00:19:58,960
Hosei-san too

575
00:19:58,700 --> 00:20:09,390
Spring Onion

576
00:19:58,960 --> 00:20:01,440
Actually eat it, Ok?

577
00:19:59,860 --> 00:20:01,640
Of course, of course

578
00:20:01,640 --> 00:20:04,340
Who the hell do you think you're talking to?

579
00:20:04,720 --> 00:20:07,480
Saying "of course" with a full mouth is no good

580
00:20:09,360 --> 00:20:16,700
Apart from Hosei and his Spring Onion, the other 4 are finished their skewers

581
00:20:16,700 --> 00:20:19,460
Hamada-san finished the Nitamago

582
00:20:19,460 --> 00:20:22,720
It seems we're always waiting for the guy with the onion

583
00:20:22,180 --> 00:20:23,580
Yup, the onion

584
00:20:23,220 --> 00:20:25,860
The guy with the onion takes a long time

585
00:20:25,860 --> 00:20:28,980
We had a good tempo going here

586
00:20:27,860 --> 00:20:29,820
A little slow pace

587
00:20:28,800 --> 00:20:30,220
Are you OK?

588
00:20:29,760 --> 00:20:32,400
Like, we have another store too...

589
00:20:32,500 --> 00:20:34,960
Don't want to stay here too long

590
00:20:35,820 --> 00:20:40,780
It took him a while, but Hosei finally finishes his Garlic and Spring Onion

591
00:20:42,560 --> 00:20:44,620
Oh! He's finished

592
00:20:44,180 --> 00:20:45,340
Finished

593
00:20:45,340 --> 00:20:46,520
Brilliant

594
00:20:49,680 --> 00:20:53,860
Next, deciding the menu for the 7th store

595
00:20:53,860 --> 00:20:56,600
The menu Endo got?

596
00:20:56,600 --> 00:20:58,420
I got Lotus Root, and ...

597
00:20:58,420 --> 00:21:01,480
Finally got it ... Spring Onion

598
00:21:00,460 --> 00:21:01,700
Oh dear!

599
00:21:02,040 --> 00:21:04,920
Someone will definitely get Spring Onion

600
00:21:04,040 --> 00:21:06,140
This is a pain in the ass

601
00:21:06,140 --> 00:21:12,420
Chicken Wing

602
00:21:06,140 --> 00:21:12,420
Ham Cutlet

603
00:21:06,140 --> 00:21:12,420
Mochi

604
00:21:06,140 --> 00:21:12,420
Monaka

605
00:21:06,140 --> 00:21:12,420
Onion

606
00:21:06,140 --> 00:21:12,420
Shishito

607
00:21:06,140 --> 00:21:12,420
Wiener

608
00:21:06,140 --> 00:21:12,420
Yamaimo

609
00:21:06,480 --> 00:21:11,820
Hosei got Yamaimo, Tanaka got Onion,
A large size menu

610
00:21:12,860 --> 00:21:23,340
They head to the 7th store, in Chuo ward,
used for employee training, the Kodenmacho location

611
00:21:23,620 --> 00:21:25,340
Tanaka-san are you gonna do it?

612
00:21:25,720 --> 00:21:26,440
I will

613
00:21:26,440 --> 00:21:27,940
Chinchirorin

614
00:21:27,120 --> 00:21:28,860
Chinchirorin

615
00:21:28,920 --> 00:21:33,300
Now Tanaka will take part in the Chinchirorin challenge!

616
00:21:33,300 --> 00:21:34,580
Get a good one

617
00:21:35,280 --> 00:21:37,020
You've got the same name after all

618
00:21:36,760 --> 00:21:38,260
It's odd

619
00:21:43,980 --> 00:21:45,260
It's here

620
00:21:44,500 --> 00:21:46,080
Your Kushikatsu

621
00:21:45,600 --> 00:21:48,560
Use the cabbage and enjoy please

622
00:21:48,980 --> 00:21:51,160
The Spring Onion ...

623
00:21:49,400 --> 00:21:51,920
The Spring Onion is small now

624
00:21:51,580 --> 00:21:53,020
Oh wow

625
00:21:53,380 --> 00:21:54,660
Oh yeah

626
00:21:54,460 --> 00:21:56,760
But the regular Onion is huge...

627
00:21:55,260 --> 00:21:57,120
The Onion is massive

628
00:21:56,800 --> 00:21:59,040
The Spring Onion was a lucky item then

629
00:21:58,000 --> 00:21:59,420
Right?

630
00:22:01,800 --> 00:22:04,900
Sorry for the wait, your Mega Jug is here

631
00:22:03,600 --> 00:22:05,320
So big

632
00:22:04,760 --> 00:22:06,960
So goddamn big

633
00:22:07,320 --> 00:22:08,340
Thank you very much

634
00:22:09,080 --> 00:22:10,340
Go ahead,

635
00:22:12,280 --> 00:22:14,260
Pretty amazing

636
00:22:13,140 --> 00:22:14,680
Hamada-san, Ham Cutlet?

637
00:22:14,680 --> 00:22:15,560
Yes

638
00:22:15,560 --> 00:22:18,400
Ham Cutlet is just straight up delicious

639
00:22:16,740 --> 00:22:18,280
I guess so

640
00:22:19,480 --> 00:22:21,680
It's something you would order

641
00:22:22,860 --> 00:22:24,420
That's big

642
00:22:23,880 --> 00:22:25,080
It's big right?

643
00:22:25,080 --> 00:22:28,120
Last time I had this it was like super thick,

644
00:22:28,120 --> 00:22:30,640
Did you guys tell them to give me a thicc one?

645
00:22:30,200 --> 00:22:34,420
We did not tell them "Make Hosei-san's Yamaimo a big one"

646
00:22:34,420 --> 00:22:36,280
I still smell something fishy,

647
00:22:36,280 --> 00:22:38,800
Sorry, I just don't trust you

648
00:22:39,960 --> 00:22:42,620
Still so slow though

649
00:22:43,980 --> 00:22:48,700
Despite the complaining, he finishes his Yamaimo and Mochi

650
00:22:50,380 --> 00:22:51,680
Spectacular

651
00:22:52,080 --> 00:22:55,400
Next, deciding the 8th store's menu

652
00:22:55,380 --> 00:22:56,740
Oh he got it

653
00:22:55,500 --> 00:22:56,780
Oh Tsukune?

654
00:22:56,440 --> 00:22:57,900
Hell yeah

655
00:22:58,640 --> 00:23:04,300
Hamada got Yamaimo, Matsumoto got Eggplant;
They are concerned with the size

656
00:22:58,640 --> 00:23:04,500
Clam

657
00:22:58,640 --> 00:23:04,500
Eggplant

658
00:22:58,640 --> 00:23:04,500
Ginko Nut

659
00:22:58,640 --> 00:23:04,500
Nitamago

660
00:22:58,640 --> 00:23:04,500
Pork

661
00:22:58,640 --> 00:23:04,500
Pork

662
00:22:58,640 --> 00:23:04,500
Potato

663
00:22:58,640 --> 00:23:04,500
Quail

664
00:22:58,640 --> 00:23:04,500
Tsukune

665
00:22:58,640 --> 00:23:04,500
Yamaimo

666
00:23:05,540 --> 00:23:07,680
What store are we going to?

667
00:23:07,680 --> 00:23:10,120
Monzen Nakkacho location

668
00:23:10,120 --> 00:23:12,220
Ah I see,

669
00:23:12,220 --> 00:23:15,520
Finally near the end huh?

670
00:23:16,740 --> 00:23:18,560
I see

671
00:23:18,100 --> 00:23:20,320
They've already started recapping

672
00:23:20,320 --> 00:23:22,500
Hamada-san said "I see"

673
00:23:20,860 --> 00:23:24,400
Looking back, we've been through a lot together

674
00:23:23,100 --> 00:23:24,260
We sure have

675
00:23:24,320 --> 00:23:28,000
We worked hard though, I thought it was gonna be impossible

676
00:23:27,980 --> 00:23:32,020
There's a total of 23 stores,
we've just been lollygagging around the middle

677
00:23:32,020 --> 00:23:34,020
NEXT WEEK, KUSHIKATSU AAANTA AFUCK AFA
