Modern Japan, a place of peace at any price

00:00:03,080 --> 00:00:06,600
With an increasing number of weaklings known as

5
00:00:03,320 --> 00:00:06,010
"herbivurous males"

6
00:00:03,320 --> 00:00:06,010
"lunchbox males"

7
00:00:06,010 --> 00:00:09,050
The number of weaklings is increasing rapidly

8
00:00:06,600 --> 00:00:08,920
"herbivurous males" or "lunchbox males"

9
00:00:09,450 --> 00:00:15,880
There's a hot-blooded teacher loved by his students

10
00:00:09,520 --> 00:00:12,850
And in this very moment, a hot-blooded teacher is rising

11
00:00:12,850 --> 00:00:15,800
To bring back the forgotten shape of young japanese men!

12
00:00:16,200 --> 00:00:23,850

The pleasure is ours!

Principal

32
00:00:31,210 --> 00:00:34,600
Yamazaki said he's feeling pressured

33
00:00:34,600 --> 00:00:35,330
About what?

34
00:00:35,330 --> 00:00:37,330
I've been told that for this episode

35
00:00:37,330 --> 00:00:40,770
There would have been 15 students

36
00:00:40,770 --> 00:00:42,730
But I can only see 8 of them

37
00:00:43,120 --> 00:00:44,130
That's about half of em

38
00:00:44,130 --> 00:00:46,920
That's because if there are less people it's easier

39
00:00:46,920 --> 00:00:49,290
for them to feel our principal's spirit
- That's it

40
00:00:49,290 --> 00:00:50,300
I see, sorry

41
00:00:50,300 --> 00:00:52,050
Isn't it better you're not that many?

42
00:00:52,050 --> 00:00:53,000
Yes sir

43
00:00:53,000 --> 00:00:55,010
Of course it is, thank you so much!

44
00:00:55,490 --> 00:00:56,450
Alright

45
00:00:56,450 --> 00:00:59,010
You deserve a slap

46
00:00:59,010 --> 00:01:00,450
Ready?
- I am

47
00:01:00,760 --> 00:01:01,840
Thank you!

48
00:01:02,240 --> 00:01:03,770
That was quick

49
00:01:03,770 --> 00:01:05,270
Komoto, put your head in there

50
00:01:05,270 --> 00:01:06,370
Put it in there

51
00:01:06,370 --> 00:01:07,560
Here?
- Yes

52
00:01:08,980 --> 00:01:09,900
What's wrong?

53
00:01:10,700 --> 00:01:11,880
All the way through
- Yes

54
00:01:11,880 --> 00:01:12,980
Till the bottom

55
00:01:14,920 --> 00:01:20,520

57
00:01:20,730 --> 00:01:22,520
Let's do some baseball, ok?

58
00:01:21,410 --> 00:01:29,130
20 lt. can catch

59
00:01:21,410 --> 00:01:29,130
catch the ball with a 20 lt can instead of a regular glove

60
00:01:22,520 --> 00:01:24,520
That's the best thing to start from

61
00:01:24,520 --> 00:01:25,640
That's right, principal

62
00:01:26,240 --> 00:01:27,160
Let's do some strikes

63
00:01:27,160 --> 00:01:29,130
Let's do it     - Alright

64
00:01:29,130 --> 00:01:29,680
Let's go

65
00:01:29,680 --> 00:01:30,360
We're ready!

66
00:01:30,360 --> 00:01:31,280
We're ready

67
00:01:31,280 --> 00:01:32,050
Wait, don't--

68
00:01:32,050 --> 00:01:33,200
You don't need those

69
00:01:33,200 --> 00:01:34,200
Just go

70
00:01:34,200 --> 00:01:34,770
We don't?

71
00:01:35,000 --> 00:01:36,170
Wait, principal...

72
00:01:36,170 --> 00:01:37,630
Wasn't it "20 lt can" catch?

73
00:01:37,630 --> 00:01:38,400
That's not it

74
00:01:38,400 --> 00:01:39,360
Huh? What?

75
00:01:39,640 --> 00:01:40,610
But these--

76
00:01:40,610 --> 00:01:42,970
How about you just use

77
00:01:42,970 --> 00:01:44,330
These

78
00:01:44,330 --> 00:01:47,570
Hands your parents gave to you?

79
00:01:45,520 --> 00:01:47,570
What? Principal...?

80
00:01:47,800 --> 00:01:48,760
Get em away

81
00:01:48,760 --> 00:01:49,880
Alright, got it

82
00:01:49,880 --> 00:01:51,880
Ehh? Wait

83
00:01:51,880 --> 00:01:53,520
Don't take em away

84
00:01:54,040 --> 00:01:55,930
That's what the principal wanted

85
00:01:55,930 --> 00:01:58,370
You all have been comedians since a long time, huh?

86
00:01:58,370 --> 00:02:00,410
And you got to know the principal too

87
00:02:00,410 --> 00:02:03,850
And has complaining ever got you anything?

88
00:02:02,210 --> 00:02:03,850
Not even once

89
00:02:03,850 --> 00:02:04,880
No, right?
- Right

90
00:02:04,880 --> 00:02:05,690
Then don't

91
00:02:05,890 --> 00:02:11,450
HOT BLOODED!!

92
00:02:07,400 --> 00:02:11,450
HAMADA'S CRAM SCHOOL!!

93
00:02:12,280 --> 00:02:14,410
Hey, come closer

94
00:02:14,410 --> 00:02:15,320
Here

95
00:02:15,520 --> 00:02:16,840
Whaaaat?!

96
00:02:19,000 --> 00:02:20,540
Excuse me, principal

97
00:02:20,540 --> 00:02:21,290
Huh?

98
00:02:21,290 --> 00:02:24,410
Can you raise your voice a bit? My ears are still ringing...

99
00:02:25,410 --> 00:02:28,290
Get over that line, quick!

100
00:02:26,880 --> 00:02:28,290
Come on, get here

101
00:02:28,290 --> 00:02:29,690
That's too close!

102
00:02:29,690 --> 00:02:31,520
What are you fussing about?

103
00:02:31,520 --> 00:02:33,840
That's way too close!

104
00:02:33,840 --> 00:02:35,320
This distance...
- Too close

105
00:02:35,320 --> 00:02:36,250
We'll die

106
00:02:36,250 --> 00:02:39,050
Can you take it from there if you use the 10 lt can?

107
00:02:39,170 --> 00:02:40,770
Let's try with the 10 lt can, ok?

108
00:02:44,890 --> 00:02:48,290
What does this silence even mean?

109
00:02:48,330 --> 00:02:53,910
HOT BLOODED!!

110
00:02:49,830 --> 00:02:53,910
HAMADA'S CRAM SCHOOL!!

111
00:02:56,280 --> 00:02:56,890
Get it!

112
00:02:57,200 --> 00:02:58,740
Nice catch! Good

113
00:02:58,740 --> 00:02:59,280
Good

114
00:02:59,520 --> 00:03:00,200
Good job

115
00:03:00,370 --> 00:03:02,490
Watch out!

116
00:03:04,290 --> 00:03:05,040
Here comes

117
00:03:09,210 --> 00:03:10,890
What's going on?

118
00:03:09,890 --> 00:03:10,890
Boring

119
00:03:11,130 --> 00:03:13,850
Has no one been hit yet?

120
00:03:14,050 --> 00:03:15,250
No blood yet?

121
00:03:16,010 --> 00:03:17,690
Like, boom! Wham!

122
00:03:17,690 --> 00:03:19,370
Is that what you're waiting for?

123
00:03:19,570 --> 00:03:25,100
HOT BLOODED!!

124
00:03:21,150 --> 00:03:25,100
HAMADA'S CRAM SCHOOL!!

125
00:03:25,370 --> 00:03:27,690
How about I smack your shin?

126
00:03:27,690 --> 00:03:30,120
But, principal...

127
00:03:30,120 --> 00:03:30,810
It would break

128
00:03:30,810 --> 00:03:32,490
Say, principal, over there

129
00:03:32,490 --> 00:03:34,850
There are some drums ready for use

130
00:03:34,850 --> 00:03:37,210
How about we try to play using them?

131
00:03:37,210 --> 00:03:38,480
By working together

132
00:03:37,890 --> 00:03:44,010
catch the ball with a drum (4 people) instead of a glove

133
00:03:37,890 --> 00:03:44,010
drum can catch

134
00:03:38,480 --> 00:03:39,280
Oh, I see

135
00:03:39,280 --> 00:03:40,560
Let's try that

136
00:03:40,760 --> 00:03:41,800
It's teamwork

137
00:03:41,800 --> 00:03:43,100
Yes sir

138
00:03:43,100 --> 00:03:43,900
Go take em

139
00:03:43,900 --> 00:03:45,200
Yes sir

140
00:03:46,960 --> 00:03:50,200
HOT BLOODED!! HAMADA'S CRAM SCHOOL!!

141
00:03:50,400 --> 00:03:52,570
It will be 4 people per can

142
00:03:52,570 --> 00:03:53,440
Sounds good

143
00:03:53,440 --> 00:03:54,320
Ok

144
00:03:54,320 --> 00:03:55,570
Can you move? You ok?

145
00:03:55,570 --> 00:03:57,370
We'll try
- We can move it

146
00:03:58,560 --> 00:03:59,370
Nice shot

147
00:04:00,690 --> 00:04:01,370
No good

148
00:04:01,560 --> 00:04:02,290
Holy shit

149
00:04:02,290 --> 00:04:03,850
The vice is pretty good

150
00:04:05,380 --> 00:04:06,330
Ok ok

151
00:04:06,330 --> 00:04:07,650
Just take it!

152
00:04:08,040 --> 00:04:08,650
Take it

153
00:04:11,650 --> 00:04:12,480
Good, good

154
00:04:12,480 --> 00:04:14,130
Come on!

155
00:04:14,130 --> 00:04:15,130
It went in!

156
00:04:16,650 --> 00:04:17,480
We got it!

157
00:04:17,480 --> 00:04:18,730
We got it, teacher

158
00:04:19,130 --> 00:04:20,170
Hey, wait a moment

159
00:04:20,170 --> 00:04:23,090
Those punks on the left are not doing anything

160
00:04:23,090 --> 00:04:25,690
We're ready!

161
00:04:25,690 --> 00:04:28,610
You're not willing at all to go get the ball

162
00:04:28,610 --> 00:04:30,250
We are!!

163
00:04:30,250 --> 00:04:31,160
Counting on you

164
00:04:33,320 --> 00:04:34,400
Man, they suck

165
00:04:35,210 --> 00:04:37,010
You four, get here

166
00:04:37,160 --> 00:04:38,050
Get your ass over here!

167
00:04:39,900 --> 00:04:41,080
Come here

168
00:04:41,080 --> 00:04:42,080
I told you to come

169
00:04:42,080 --> 00:04:43,640
Leave the can and come here

170
00:04:43,640 --> 00:04:44,440
Yes sir

171
00:04:46,250 --> 00:04:48,130
Kneel down

172
00:04:47,320 --> 00:04:48,130
What?

173
00:04:48,130 --> 00:04:50,930
Kneel down

174
00:04:50,930 --> 00:04:52,640
Why aren't you catching it?

175
00:04:55,040 --> 00:04:59,600
We threw it near you and yet you didn't dare to get it

176
00:04:59,600 --> 00:05:00,840
That ball is for you

177
00:05:00,840 --> 00:05:02,120
Yes sir

178
00:05:02,810 --> 00:05:04,090
Are you not enjoying it?

179
00:05:04,090 --> 00:05:05,320
No way, that's not true

180
00:05:05,320 --> 00:05:05,960
Of course

181
00:05:06,320 --> 00:05:07,010
Alright

182
00:05:10,680 --> 00:05:12,000
What's wrong, principal?

183
00:05:18,650 --> 00:05:21,170
Everyone, gather!

184
00:05:23,850 --> 00:05:25,650
On your knees

185
00:05:25,650 --> 00:05:27,810
This is what the principal wants to say

186
00:05:27,810 --> 00:05:29,810
Are you wondering why you're here?

187
00:05:30,080 --> 00:05:30,720
That's why

188
00:05:32,280 --> 00:05:34,180
"I wanted to see smiles and such!"

189
00:05:35,370 --> 00:05:36,810
Understood?!

190
00:05:38,640 --> 00:05:40,450
No one is smiling here

191
00:05:40,450 --> 00:05:42,450
Is this the attitude you wanna show

192
00:05:42,680 --> 00:05:44,240
To the principal?!

193
00:05:44,930 --> 00:05:47,650
No need to say that, I think they got it

194
00:05:47,650 --> 00:05:48,880
Alright, let's move on

195
00:05:48,880 --> 00:05:49,890
Yes sir!

196
00:05:49,890 --> 00:05:50,520
Oh

197
00:05:50,650 --> 00:05:53,610
At least your response is good

198
00:05:53,880 --> 00:05:55,960
Try to laugh... that's it

199
00:05:56,560 --> 00:05:58,360
Laugh more

200
00:05:58,960 --> 00:06:00,450
Principal...

201
00:06:00,450 --> 00:06:02,730
Fujiwara is not laughing at all

202
00:06:02,960 --> 00:06:04,730
Is that really ok?

203
00:06:05,320 --> 00:06:05,770
Listen

204
00:06:05,770 --> 00:06:07,810
If you're not really feeling it

205
00:06:07,810 --> 00:06:10,250
Just go tell your dear vice

206
00:06:10,490 --> 00:06:16,250

216
00:06:28,490 --> 00:06:35,970
HOT BLOODED!!

217
00:06:29,990 --> 00:06:35,970
HAMADA'S CRAM SCHOOL!!

218
00:06:36,210 --> 00:06:36,880
Vice?

219
00:06:36,880 --> 00:06:37,280
Yes?

220
00:06:37,280 --> 00:06:38,570
Let's do some throws

221
00:06:38,570 --> 00:06:39,360
Yes sir

222
00:06:39,360 --> 00:06:40,930
Come here one by one

223
00:06:41,300 --> 00:06:42,680
Let's see... License

224
00:06:42,680 --> 00:06:43,080
Yes sir

225
00:06:43,080 --> 00:06:45,040
You're the youngest here
- Yes

226
00:06:45,040 --> 00:06:46,880
So you'll make this spin

227
00:06:46,880 --> 00:06:47,780
You're in charge

228
00:06:48,450 --> 00:06:50,720
The one who spins will be the batter

229
00:06:51,570 --> 00:06:53,130
As soon as it stops...

230
00:06:53,130 --> 00:06:55,570
You throw the ball

231
00:06:55,570 --> 00:06:59,130
I told you it's throwing, so you throw it

232
00:06:59,130 --> 00:07:01,450
But you can't it just roll around

233
00:07:01,450 --> 00:07:04,370
So you go get it

234
00:07:03,320 --> 00:07:05,970
So we throw it and get it back?

235
00:07:06,970 --> 00:07:08,210
That's because

236
00:07:08,210 --> 00:07:12,250
Hamada's cram school is incredible

237
00:07:09,800 --> 00:07:12,250
So we throw it and run around the bases?

238
00:07:12,450 --> 00:07:14,680
Make sure to slide when you get back here

239
00:07:12,930 --> 00:07:25,250
sit on the chair and make it spin; once it stops, throw the ball

240
00:07:12,930 --> 00:07:25,250
swivel chair baseball

241
00:07:12,930 --> 00:07:25,250
then you go get it yourself and go back to your home base

242
00:07:14,680 --> 00:07:15,640
Slide...?

243
00:07:16,500 --> 00:07:18,640
There is so much to do

244
00:07:18,640 --> 00:07:20,000
That's too much

245
00:07:20,000 --> 00:07:21,160
There's a lot

246
00:07:21,160 --> 00:07:22,360
All by ourselves?

247
00:07:22,360 --> 00:07:24,280
I'll see if you're safe or not

248
00:07:24,280 --> 00:07:25,250
Yes sir

249
00:07:25,250 --> 00:07:27,530
You're all doing this

250
00:07:26,720 --> 00:07:27,530
That's right

251
00:07:27,530 --> 00:07:28,640
Yes sir

252
00:07:28,640 --> 00:07:29,200
Tanaka

253
00:07:29,720 --> 00:07:30,080
Yes?

254
00:07:30,010 --> 00:07:32,650
Tanaka is challenged!

255
00:07:30,080 --> 00:07:30,720
Come here

256
00:07:31,120 --> 00:07:31,900
Yes sir

257
00:07:31,900 --> 00:07:32,650
Go get em

258
00:07:32,650 --> 00:07:34,250
Good luck!

259
00:07:34,650 --> 00:07:35,400
Here we go

260
00:07:35,400 --> 00:07:35,960
Alright

261
00:07:35,960 --> 00:07:36,960
Spin it

262
00:07:36,960 --> 00:07:38,600
One, two...

263
00:07:39,000 --> 00:07:42,800
HOT BLOODED!! HAMADA'S CRAM SCHOOL!!

264
00:07:42,800 --> 00:07:45,760
Eight, nine, ten

265
00:07:45,760 --> 00:07:46,240
Alright

266
00:07:46,240 --> 00:07:47,410
He got the ball

267
00:07:47,410 --> 00:07:48,480
Throw it

268
00:07:48,480 --> 00:07:49,120
Watch out

269
00:07:49,120 --> 00:07:50,090
Alright, he threw it

270
00:07:50,090 --> 00:07:51,690
Go after it, quick!

271
00:07:51,690 --> 00:07:52,930
Defend it!

272
00:07:52,930 --> 00:07:54,200
Defensedefensedefense

273
00:07:54,640 --> 00:07:57,010
You can do it!
- Defense!

274
00:07:57,010 --> 00:07:59,890
That's the opposite direction!

275
00:08:00,240 --> 00:08:01,450
It's in the centre

276
00:08:02,080 --> 00:08:02,800
Defend it!

277
00:08:02,800 --> 00:08:03,960
Over there!
- Left!

278
00:08:03,960 --> 00:08:06,050
The other side!
- Go left!

279
00:08:08,890 --> 00:08:11,410
That's a different ball, isn't it?

280
00:08:11,410 --> 00:08:12,890
He took another one

281
00:08:12,890 --> 00:08:15,930
He took one from our previous can game

282
00:08:14,120 --> 00:08:15,930
Are you for real?

283
00:08:15,930 --> 00:08:17,630
Come on, almost there!

284
00:08:17,630 --> 00:08:19,280
You can do it!

285
00:08:19,280 --> 00:08:21,280
Hang in there!

286
00:08:21,280 --> 00:08:22,600
Slide, now!

287
00:08:25,730 --> 00:08:26,960
You're out!

288
00:08:28,610 --> 00:08:34,160
HOT BLOODED!!

289
00:08:30,120 --> 00:08:34,160
HAMADA'S CRAM SCHOOL!!

290
00:08:34,410 --> 00:08:35,440
Ready

291
00:08:34,810 --> 00:08:38,690
Shoji is challenged!

292
00:08:35,440 --> 00:08:36,520
Alright, I'm ready

293
00:08:37,080 --> 00:08:38,480
Let's go

294
00:08:38,760 --> 00:08:40,560
Two, three...

295
00:08:40,760 --> 00:08:44,200
HOT BLOODED!! HAMADA'S CRAM SCHOOL!!

296
00:08:44,200 --> 00:08:47,200
18, 19, 20... go!

297
00:08:44,880 --> 00:08:46,440
Yeah, like that

298
00:08:47,200 --> 00:08:48,440
Throw the ball

299
00:08:52,880 --> 00:08:54,400
Hang in there

300
00:08:54,400 --> 00:08:58,080
You can do it, Shoji

301
00:08:58,080 --> 00:08:58,900
Watch out

302
00:08:59,120 --> 00:09:01,440
Shoji is dangerous, watch out

303
00:09:01,440 --> 00:09:03,250
Stay focused
- Go for the ball

304
00:09:03,250 --> 00:09:05,680
He's going in the right direction
- Good

305
00:09:05,680 --> 00:09:06,480
Very good

306
00:09:06,480 --> 00:09:07,520
On your left

307
00:09:07,520 --> 00:09:08,160
Almost there

308
00:09:08,160 --> 00:09:08,900
Here it is

309
00:09:08,900 --> 00:09:10,200
Well done

310
00:09:10,200 --> 00:09:11,700
Now go back

311
00:09:11,700 --> 00:09:12,900
He's good

312
00:09:12,900 --> 00:09:13,850
He is
- Hang in there

313
00:09:13,850 --> 00:09:15,640
Be ready to slide

314
00:09:17,800 --> 00:09:19,330
You did pretty good

315
00:09:19,330 --> 00:09:20,770
Next one

316
00:09:20,770 --> 00:09:21,930
You did good

317
00:09:21,930 --> 00:09:24,410
Let's go back, Shoji

318
00:09:26,240 --> 00:09:27,240
That's how you do it

319
00:09:29,600 --> 00:09:31,200
I think he...

320
00:09:31,200 --> 00:09:32,360
Wanted to be scolded

321
00:09:32,610 --> 00:09:38,130
HOT BLOODED!!

322
00:09:34,120 --> 00:09:38,130
HAMADA'S CRAM SCHOOL!!

323
00:09:38,410 --> 00:09:39,280
Next up

324
00:09:39,050 --> 00:09:45,170
blindfolded battle

325
00:09:39,050 --> 00:09:45,170
put the blindfold on and battle by relying only on the sound of bells

326
00:09:39,920 --> 00:09:41,680
It's a blindfolded battle

327
00:09:41,680 --> 00:09:42,560
It's a battle

328
00:09:42,560 --> 00:09:44,760
All our students did this before

329
00:09:44,760 --> 00:09:45,690
That's true

330
00:09:45,690 --> 00:09:47,650
And they've all become presidents or such by now

331
00:09:47,650 --> 00:09:48,200
Presidents?

332
00:09:48,200 --> 00:09:48,890
That's right

333
00:09:48,890 --> 00:09:50,770
All those who went to our cram school

334
00:09:50,770 --> 00:09:53,410
Became presidents or such in various places

335
00:09:53,410 --> 00:09:57,090
Some of them became politicians too

336
00:09:55,760 --> 00:09:57,090
That's right

337
00:09:57,290 --> 00:10:02,810
HOT BLOODED!!

338
00:09:58,820 --> 00:10:02,810
HAMADA'S CRAM SCHOOL!!

339
00:10:03,050 --> 00:10:03,680
Get ready

340
00:10:09,820 --> 00:10:11,960
Strike where you hear the bells

341
00:10:13,110 --> 00:10:13,960
Ouch
- It hurts

342
00:10:14,660 --> 00:10:16,120
It hurts
- Ouch

343
00:10:18,750 --> 00:10:19,800
The bells are ringing

344
00:10:22,760 --> 00:10:23,720
That hurt

345
00:10:23,720 --> 00:10:26,720
it's just "itai" ("it hurts")

346
00:10:28,880 --> 00:10:31,130
I must say, this year...

347
00:10:31,130 --> 00:10:33,810
Sure brought us a bad harvest

348
00:10:33,810 --> 00:10:35,130
Doesn't it look like

349
00:10:35,130 --> 00:10:37,930
They're kind of holding back?

350
00:10:37,280 --> 00:10:37,930
I see

351
00:10:37,930 --> 00:10:41,450
Maybe they don't need the blindfold

352
00:10:39,830 --> 00:10:41,450
You have a point

353
00:10:41,450 --> 00:10:42,450
It makes sense

354
00:10:42,450 --> 00:10:46,370
Let's do it as if you're blindfolded

355
00:10:44,450 --> 00:10:46,370
"As if"?

356
00:10:46,370 --> 00:10:47,690
What do you mean by "as if"?

357
00:10:47,690 --> 00:10:51,090
Do it as if you couldn't see

358
00:10:49,400 --> 00:10:51,090
As if I couldn't see...

359
00:10:51,290 --> 00:10:56,900
HOT BLOODED!!

360
00:10:52,840 --> 00:10:56,900
HAMADA'S CRAM SCHOOL!!

361
00:10:57,160 --> 00:10:58,480
Let's try that a bit

362
00:10:58,760 --> 00:10:59,530
Ready

363
00:10:59,960 --> 00:11:00,360
Go

364
00:11:15,250 --> 00:11:16,050
Come here

365
00:11:16,050 --> 00:11:18,530
What was that?

366
00:11:17,120 --> 00:11:19,450
We did it as if we couldn't see
- Yeah, that's it

367
00:11:19,450 --> 00:11:19,890
Well

368
00:11:19,890 --> 00:11:21,200
They act like students

369
00:11:21,200 --> 00:11:21,960
You're right

370
00:11:21,960 --> 00:11:23,490
That's not good

371
00:11:23,490 --> 00:11:26,610
You won't become a president like this

372
00:11:24,370 --> 00:11:26,610
You won't

373
00:11:26,610 --> 00:11:28,570
You want to become a president, right?

374
00:11:28,570 --> 00:11:30,050
Not really

375
00:11:30,050 --> 00:11:32,010
That's why you came here, isn't it true?

376
00:11:32,530 --> 00:11:34,530
It's not like we want to be presidents

377
00:11:34,800 --> 00:11:35,520
That's not it?

378
00:11:35,520 --> 00:11:35,930
Yes

379
00:11:35,930 --> 00:11:36,970
That's not it

380
00:11:36,970 --> 00:11:38,370
Well, if that's it

381
00:11:38,370 --> 00:11:39,770
Let's just

382
00:11:39,770 --> 00:11:42,410
Let's quit using the sticks

383
00:11:40,650 --> 00:11:41,320
I agree

384
00:11:42,410 --> 00:11:45,330
Let's do it as if you could look and as if you had a stick

385
00:11:45,830 --> 00:11:48,760
So we pretend both to see and to have a stick?

386
00:11:49,060 --> 00:11:50,200
Yes, ready?

387
00:11:53,100 --> 00:11:53,900
Wait

388
00:11:58,300 --> 00:12:00,000
The enemy is right there!

389
00:12:00,730 --> 00:12:02,170
You won't be a boss like that!

390
00:12:04,630 --> 00:12:06,430
You won't become a president this way

391
00:12:07,170 --> 00:12:09,890
Alright, Yamazaki: go solo

392
00:12:09,890 --> 00:12:11,400
It hurts, who was it?!

393
00:12:11,400 --> 00:12:12,920
Who was it?! It hurts

394
00:12:12,920 --> 00:12:14,160
Stop it, stop!

395
00:12:14,400 --> 00:12:15,200
From here?

396
00:12:15,800 --> 00:12:16,480
He's here---

397
00:12:17,280 --> 00:12:18,980
Are you here? Are you?!

398
00:12:18,980 --> 00:12:20,240
Are you here or not!?

399
00:12:20,240 --> 00:12:21,290
It hurts, stop

400
00:12:21,290 --> 00:12:23,690
Alright, Inoue: go solo

401
00:12:22,880 --> 00:12:23,800
Where are you?!

402
00:12:25,280 --> 00:12:26,960
Damn, you got my ear!

403
00:12:27,560 --> 00:12:29,450
Who hit my ear?! Where am I?!

404
00:12:29,450 --> 00:12:32,050
Ok, Tanaka: go solo

405
00:12:30,520 --> 00:12:32,050
Hey! Where are you?!

406
00:12:32,050 --> 00:12:33,360
Are you here? It hurts!

407
00:12:33,360 --> 00:12:34,450
It hurts, where are--

408
00:12:34,450 --> 00:12:36,610
Shoji: go solo

409
00:12:35,090 --> 00:12:36,610
Where are you?!

410
00:12:36,610 --> 00:12:37,720
Stop it! Where are you?!

411
00:12:38,280 --> 00:12:39,020
Ouch!

412
00:12:40,520 --> 00:12:41,680
You can't do that!

413
00:12:43,480 --> 00:12:45,400
Stop-- where are you going?

414
00:12:46,400 --> 00:12:48,880
It huuuuuurts

415
00:12:48,880 --> 00:12:49,570
Spare me!

416
00:12:49,570 --> 00:12:52,530
Let's have him do it some more

417
00:12:52,760 --> 00:12:54,930
Stop focusing only on me

418
00:12:56,240 --> 00:12:58,200
Why only me?! Ouch

419
00:12:58,200 --> 00:13:00,960
Anything but that!

420
00:13:03,060 --> 00:13:04,400
Don't do this to me

421
00:13:05,080 --> 00:13:06,400
I can't do it anymore

422
00:13:07,600 --> 00:13:09,280
You can't do this to me

423
00:13:10,680 --> 00:13:12,520
Not seeing is scary

424
00:13:13,000 --> 00:13:14,520
It's really frightening

425
00:13:15,040 --> 00:13:15,800
This--

426
00:13:16,200 --> 00:13:17,800
I'm dead tired

427
00:13:21,850 --> 00:13:23,650
Alright, go back

428
00:13:26,210 --> 00:13:31,710
HOT BLOODED!!

429
00:13:27,720 --> 00:13:31,710
HAMADA'S CRAM SCHOOL!!

430
00:13:31,970 --> 00:13:33,040
What do you think, Endo?

431
00:13:33,320 --> 00:13:33,890
Yes

432
00:13:33,890 --> 00:13:35,000
I think

433
00:13:35,640 --> 00:13:37,360
That was very useful for us

434
00:13:38,120 --> 00:13:38,810
Thank you

435
00:13:39,440 --> 00:13:39,850
More

436
00:13:39,850 --> 00:13:42,850
Speak some more

437
00:13:43,090 --> 00:13:45,690
I want you to be the best speaker

438
00:13:46,360 --> 00:13:47,320
Our objective

439
00:13:47,650 --> 00:13:50,040
Was to hold a stick while blindfolded

440
00:13:50,400 --> 00:13:51,490
We did this at first

441
00:13:51,490 --> 00:13:52,520
But halfway

442
00:13:53,190 --> 00:13:55,650
We took the mask off and we pretended not to---

443
00:13:55,650 --> 00:13:58,050
Yeah, keep on talking no matter what happens

444
00:13:58,050 --> 00:13:58,760
Well...

445
00:13:59,160 --> 00:14:00,760
We acted as if we couldn't see

446
00:14:00,760 --> 00:14:01,960
And we fought

447
00:14:01,960 --> 00:14:04,960
And we got to spend some really useful time

448
00:14:04,960 --> 00:14:06,210
So thank you so much!

449
00:14:06,210 --> 00:14:06,890
Don't end it

450
00:14:06,890 --> 00:14:08,200
W-we, I think---

451
00:14:08,200 --> 00:14:10,840
We had so much fun during it and

452
00:14:11,240 --> 00:14:12,840
And while we were feeling it---

453
00:14:12,840 --> 00:14:13,520
Principal?

454
00:14:13,240 --> 00:14:14,370
We had the pleasure to--

455
00:14:14,000 --> 00:14:14,370
Principal?!

456
00:14:14,530 --> 00:14:20,140
HOT BLOODED!!

457
00:14:16,130 --> 00:14:20,140
HAMADA'S CRAM SCHOOL!!

458
00:14:20,370 --> 00:14:23,330
Next up is "steal the bun from Hamada-statue"

459
00:14:23,330 --> 00:14:24,400
Yes sir

460
00:14:23,970 --> 00:14:33,410
steal the bun from the blindfolded principal without being attacked!

461
00:14:23,970 --> 00:14:33,410
steal the bun! Hamada-statue

462
00:14:24,400 --> 00:14:26,320
I'll sit and be the blindfolded statue

463
00:14:26,320 --> 00:14:27,040
The principal

464
00:14:27,290 --> 00:14:30,000
You come here and try to steal this bun, one by one

465
00:14:30,000 --> 00:14:31,030
Yes sir

466
00:14:31,030 --> 00:14:32,440
You can eat it if you take it

467
00:14:32,440 --> 00:14:35,440
Yes sir    - But I'll be holding a paper fan with one hand

468
00:14:35,680 --> 00:14:37,360
And other stuff too

469
00:14:37,360 --> 00:14:37,880
Alright

470
00:14:37,880 --> 00:14:38,450
Got it?

471
00:14:38,450 --> 00:14:42,570
There are different attacks, right?

472
00:14:40,040 --> 00:14:42,570
That's right, you have to dodge em

473
00:14:42,570 --> 00:14:44,500
And just go grab the bun

474
00:14:44,500 --> 00:14:45,490
Yes sir

475
00:14:45,490 --> 00:14:47,190
Ok principal, the mask, please

476
00:14:51,490 --> 00:14:52,290
This?

477
00:14:52,950 --> 00:14:54,520
The principal will wear it

478
00:14:54,520 --> 00:14:54,960
Sure

479
00:14:58,330 --> 00:14:59,630
So, who's going first?

480
00:14:59,840 --> 00:15:00,500
Komoto

481
00:15:02,080 --> 00:15:02,680
You're up

482
00:15:02,680 --> 00:15:03,120
Yessir

483
00:15:04,280 --> 00:15:05,880
Observe the principal...

484
00:15:06,320 --> 00:15:08,120
Principal...?
- The hell do you want?!

485
00:15:12,250 --> 00:15:14,530
That's his cute side

486
00:15:14,530 --> 00:15:16,290
It's going on forever

487
00:15:16,640 --> 00:15:17,960
That was his QT side

488
00:15:17,960 --> 00:15:19,840
Now the principal can't see

489
00:15:19,840 --> 00:15:20,200
Yes

490
00:15:20,200 --> 00:15:23,120
But principal, you have to grab that button

491
00:15:23,120 --> 00:15:25,120
You had to do it before putting that on

492
00:15:26,820 --> 00:15:28,080
What are ya laughin' at?!

493
00:15:28,080 --> 00:15:28,880
We're sorry

494
00:15:28,880 --> 00:15:30,680
It's this one, principal

495
00:15:30,680 --> 00:15:32,200
Check the button first

496
00:15:35,360 --> 00:15:36,090
Alright

497
00:15:43,600 --> 00:15:45,200
The hell are you doin'?

498
00:15:45,850 --> 00:15:47,250
What was that for

499
00:15:48,800 --> 00:15:49,560
Ok, let's start

500
00:15:50,240 --> 00:15:51,080
Alright, Komoto

501
00:15:51,080 --> 00:15:51,610
Yes sir

502
00:15:51,610 --> 00:15:55,010
Let's go!   - Go Komoto!   - Good luck!

503
00:15:52,010 --> 00:15:55,010
Komoto is challenged!

504
00:15:55,010 --> 00:15:55,760
Ready...

505
00:15:55,760 --> 00:15:56,400
Grab that bun

506
00:15:56,400 --> 00:15:56,860
Start!

507
00:15:56,860 --> 00:15:58,460
Take it take it!

508
00:15:58,460 --> 00:15:59,200
Careful

509
00:15:59,200 --> 00:16:00,380
Take that bun

510
00:16:00,380 --> 00:16:01,680
You can do it

511
00:16:01,680 --> 00:16:02,960
Remember, he can't see you

512
00:16:03,640 --> 00:16:04,240
Scary

513
00:16:04,240 --> 00:16:05,320
He can't see you

514
00:16:05,920 --> 00:16:06,620
Here goes

515
00:16:06,620 --> 00:16:08,080
You can take it!

516
00:16:12,500 --> 00:16:13,650
Ok, ok

517
00:16:13,650 --> 00:16:15,650
You can do it

518
00:16:15,650 --> 00:16:17,150
Go grab it

519
00:16:17,150 --> 00:16:18,720
Almost there, you can do it

520
00:16:19,880 --> 00:16:21,720
Just take it, now!

521
00:16:21,720 --> 00:16:22,600
Go, Komoto!

522
00:16:22,600 --> 00:16:23,280
You can do it!

523
00:16:23,280 --> 00:16:24,120
Almost there

524
00:16:24,120 --> 00:16:27,490
Watch out! He almost got you!

525
00:16:27,490 --> 00:16:31,280
Watch out, it's dangerous!

526
00:16:31,280 --> 00:16:32,240
Avoid it!

527
00:16:32,240 --> 00:16:33,370
Enough!

528
00:16:33,370 --> 00:16:34,770
Eh?

529
00:16:33,960 --> 00:16:34,770
That's enough

530
00:16:35,400 --> 00:16:37,000
What are you doing, principal?

531
00:16:38,960 --> 00:16:40,450
Are you kidding me?

532
00:16:40,640 --> 00:16:43,320
He already took it

533
00:16:43,320 --> 00:16:45,010
He's currently eating it

534
00:16:45,010 --> 00:16:46,480
Want to do it one more time?

535
00:16:46,480 --> 00:16:47,720
Yeah it's ok I guess

536
00:16:47,720 --> 00:16:49,210
I really have no idea

537
00:16:49,210 --> 00:16:50,080
Let's go then

538
00:16:50,440 --> 00:16:51,160
Tanaka

539
00:16:51,160 --> 00:16:51,720
Yes sir

540
00:16:51,720 --> 00:16:52,290
Try it

541
00:16:52,290 --> 00:16:52,840
Alright

542
00:16:52,530 --> 00:16:54,970
Tanaka is challenged!

543
00:16:52,840 --> 00:16:53,640
Do your best

544
00:16:53,640 --> 00:16:54,120
I will

545
00:16:54,120 --> 00:16:54,970
Let's do it

546
00:16:55,320 --> 00:16:56,680
Ready and... start!

547
00:17:00,200 --> 00:17:02,000
You can do it

548
00:17:02,000 --> 00:17:02,520
Come on

549
00:17:04,880 --> 00:17:06,920
Stay calm
- Focus!

550
00:17:08,820 --> 00:17:11,480
Like this
- You can do it

551
00:17:11,480 --> 00:17:12,280
Watch out

552
00:17:12,280 --> 00:17:13,280
Hang on

553
00:17:13,280 --> 00:17:15,280
Watch out
- Almost got you

554
00:17:15,280 --> 00:17:16,030
Watch out!

555
00:17:16,030 --> 00:17:18,030
Move slowly
- Close call!

556
00:17:18,330 --> 00:17:19,210
Woah, watch out!

557
00:17:19,440 --> 00:17:21,930
Watch out!!
- Avoid that thing

558
00:17:21,930 --> 00:17:23,000
Here goes, here goes

559
00:17:23,480 --> 00:17:24,400
Watch his orbit

560
00:17:24,400 --> 00:17:26,400
Move slowly, like this

561
00:17:26,680 --> 00:17:28,380
Woah, that was close!

562
00:17:28,380 --> 00:17:29,930
Enough of that, geez

563
00:17:31,760 --> 00:17:33,040
Take the mask off

564
00:17:34,600 --> 00:17:36,080
He quickly took it

565
00:17:37,440 --> 00:17:38,170
Say principal

566
00:17:38,170 --> 00:17:42,370
When do you plan to press that switch?

567
00:17:42,570 --> 00:17:48,160
HOT BLOODED!!

568
00:17:44,050 --> 00:17:48,160
HAMADA'S CRAM SCHOOL!!

569
00:17:48,410 --> 00:17:50,650
Have you forgotten you had two items?

570
00:17:51,620 --> 00:17:53,010
Vice, I can't see anything

571
00:17:53,010 --> 00:17:54,770
Maybe it's better if you see more

572
00:17:54,770 --> 00:17:58,850
There's another mask which lets you see a bit more

573
00:17:57,250 --> 00:17:58,850
A bit more?

574
00:17:58,850 --> 00:18:01,650
Yeah, like a grid, but you can't see through it

575
00:18:01,650 --> 00:18:03,200
The cloth is just thinner

576
00:18:03,200 --> 00:18:03,720
He can see

577
00:18:03,720 --> 00:18:05,970
The cloth is a grid, so...

578
00:18:05,120 --> 00:18:08,570
No way, I'm sure he can see us

579
00:18:05,970 --> 00:18:08,570
No good, I can't see

580
00:18:08,570 --> 00:18:10,800
I can see he's looking at us

581
00:18:10,800 --> 00:18:11,560
I see his eyes

582
00:18:11,560 --> 00:18:12,290
Ok, so...

583
00:18:12,290 --> 00:18:14,320
Go Yamazaki

584
00:18:12,690 --> 00:18:16,250
Housei is challenged!

585
00:18:15,320 --> 00:18:16,250
Come here    - He said "come here"

586
00:18:16,250 --> 00:18:17,800
Can't he really see?

587
00:18:18,000 --> 00:18:19,120
He told me to come

588
00:18:19,570 --> 00:18:20,970
What's wrong!?

589
00:18:20,970 --> 00:18:22,970
Wait, how can he--?

590
00:18:23,680 --> 00:18:24,370
C'mere

591
00:18:25,120 --> 00:18:26,370
What does this mean?!

592
00:18:26,370 --> 00:18:27,520
What's going on?!

593
00:18:27,800 --> 00:18:29,440
This--- it hurts!

594
00:18:29,440 --> 00:18:30,600
Please stop

595
00:18:31,080 --> 00:18:32,050
Principal!!

596
00:18:32,130 --> 00:18:38,600
HOT BLOODED!! HAMADA'S CRAM SCHOOL!!

597
00:18:32,370 --> 00:18:38,970
After this

598
00:18:32,370 --> 00:18:38,970
Even more incredible Hamada's Cram School!!

599
00:18:39,490 --> 00:18:44,760
HOT BLOODED!!

600
00:18:41,040 --> 00:18:44,760
HAMADA'S CRAM SCHOOL!!

601
00:18:45,080 --> 00:18:46,360
Next up is this

602
00:18:46,360 --> 00:18:46,840
Vice

603
00:18:46,840 --> 00:18:47,560
Sure

604
00:18:47,560 --> 00:18:48,360
It's this

605
00:18:49,040 --> 00:18:50,960
Do you remember it?
- We do

606
00:18:50,960 --> 00:18:51,960
It's a slinky

607
00:18:51,960 --> 00:18:53,040
With this, you

608
00:18:53,130 --> 00:18:59,370
slinky relay

609
00:18:53,130 --> 00:18:59,370
time attack race: form an horizontal row and pass the slinky

610
00:18:53,550 --> 00:18:55,680
You use your hand and make a relay

611
00:18:56,000 --> 00:18:56,840
With the slinky

612
00:18:56,840 --> 00:18:58,000
Ok

613
00:18:58,000 --> 00:18:59,370
It will be a time attack

614
00:18:59,370 --> 00:18:59,930
Time race?

615
00:18:59,930 --> 00:19:04,850
We'll measure time

616
00:19:04,850 --> 00:19:05,970
Use both your hands

617
00:19:06,160 --> 00:19:09,010
So make it go here, and there, then there etc.

618
00:19:09,010 --> 00:19:09,920
Ok, so

619
00:19:09,920 --> 00:19:13,480
Your goal is until it reaches Inomoto's hands

620
00:19:15,210 --> 00:19:16,730
Who are we racing against...?

621
00:19:16,970 --> 00:19:19,930
You'll become a president with this

622
00:19:19,930 --> 00:19:22,530
You could even become a trader

623
00:19:22,530 --> 00:19:23,720
Get ready
- Alright

624
00:19:23,720 --> 00:19:24,330
As soon as

625
00:19:24,330 --> 00:19:27,050
My watch hits 12 o'clock, you start

626
00:19:26,120 --> 00:19:29,050
12 o'clock?   - We can't see it...

627
00:19:27,050 --> 00:19:29,050
Ready and...

628
00:19:29,050 --> 00:19:29,880
Start

629
00:19:35,000 --> 00:19:35,850
W-wait, this---

630
00:19:40,750 --> 00:19:41,600
What's this?

631
00:19:43,040 --> 00:19:43,800
Looking good

632
00:19:43,800 --> 00:19:45,680
It's coming, good

633
00:19:47,400 --> 00:19:48,240
It's fine, it's fine

634
00:19:48,240 --> 00:19:49,200
We're good

635
00:19:49,200 --> 00:19:50,000
Let's do this

636
00:19:50,000 --> 00:19:51,200
A bit more

637
00:19:51,200 --> 00:19:52,920
Almost there
- You got this

638
00:19:53,360 --> 00:19:54,920
We can do it!

639
00:19:54,920 --> 00:19:56,000
Alright

640
00:19:56,000 --> 00:19:57,000
Done!

641
00:19:58,650 --> 00:20:01,650
35 seconds

642
00:20:00,130 --> 00:20:01,650
Alright!

643
00:20:02,650 --> 00:20:03,450
We did it

644
00:20:03,450 --> 00:20:07,770
I don't want to take part in such tv show

645
00:20:06,800 --> 00:20:07,770
The hell is this?

646
00:20:07,770 --> 00:20:09,650
Is that what you wanted?

647
00:20:10,080 --> 00:20:11,480
I mean, this...

648
00:20:11,480 --> 00:20:12,380
It worked fine

649
00:20:12,380 --> 00:20:15,290
They can't even do it!
- It's just like this

650
00:20:15,490 --> 00:20:18,130
We have to make steps

651
00:20:18,130 --> 00:20:19,360
So it goes down?

652
00:20:19,360 --> 00:20:22,090
That's right, Endo your hands must be lower

653
00:20:22,090 --> 00:20:23,960
That's it, that should do it

654
00:20:23,960 --> 00:20:24,360
Yes

655
00:20:24,360 --> 00:20:25,240
Like this?

656
00:20:25,240 --> 00:20:27,360
It goes way lower

657
00:20:27,360 --> 00:20:28,480
More like this

658
00:20:28,480 --> 00:20:30,760
Just like stairs

659
00:20:30,760 --> 00:20:32,040
That should do
- Stairs

660
00:20:32,040 --> 00:20:33,130
Wait up

661
00:20:33,130 --> 00:20:33,610
Ok

662
00:20:33,610 --> 00:20:37,050
Start as soon as my watch hits "6"

663
00:20:35,240 --> 00:20:37,750
How should we know?   - We can't see it

664
00:20:41,440 --> 00:20:42,340
Ok ok ok

665
00:20:42,340 --> 00:20:44,520
That should do, you can do it

666
00:20:45,620 --> 00:20:46,520
Hurry up

667
00:20:49,340 --> 00:20:51,240
Oh, it's going well
- Ok, ok!

668
00:20:51,240 --> 00:20:52,020
Somewhat ok

669
00:20:52,020 --> 00:20:53,600
Pretty quick
- Done!

670
00:20:55,170 --> 00:20:55,930
I think

671
00:20:55,930 --> 00:20:59,730
We have to cast the blame on 1 or 2 of you here

672
00:20:59,890 --> 00:21:05,480
HOT BLOODED!!

673
00:21:01,430 --> 00:21:05,480
HAMADA'S CRAM SCHOOL!!

674
00:21:05,690 --> 00:21:07,760
Let's have another relay next

675
00:21:08,050 --> 00:21:09,160
A relay
- Yes sir

676
00:21:09,160 --> 00:21:10,080
Here

677
00:21:10,080 --> 00:21:11,810
See those wet towels?
- Yes

678
00:21:11,810 --> 00:21:13,940
Take one and put it over your head

679
00:21:12,450 --> 00:21:23,210
race: break the paper balloon of your teammate (left) with the wet towel

680
00:21:12,450 --> 00:21:23,210
wet towel time attack

681
00:21:13,940 --> 00:21:14,720
Yes sir

682
00:21:14,720 --> 00:21:16,640
In order, starting from here

683
00:21:16,640 --> 00:21:18,890
You have to burst it with your wet towel

684
00:21:18,890 --> 00:21:19,360
Yes sir

685
00:21:19,360 --> 00:21:22,660
Like, bam, bam, bam... I'll measure the time

686
00:21:22,660 --> 00:21:23,210
Got it

687
00:21:23,560 --> 00:21:26,410
As soon as it turns into 4 we'll start

688
00:21:24,640 --> 00:21:25,210
Yes

689
00:21:25,210 --> 00:21:26,040
How do we...

690
00:21:26,040 --> 00:21:28,080
We don't know that    - We can't see

691
00:21:28,080 --> 00:21:29,560
Ready...

692
00:21:41,000 --> 00:21:42,840
Ok!
- Ok, ok!

693
00:21:43,450 --> 00:21:45,410
Only Inoue's ballon broke

694
00:21:45,410 --> 00:21:45,810
See?

695
00:21:45,810 --> 00:21:48,280
This is what I wanted to see

696
00:21:48,280 --> 00:21:50,130
All you did was throw em away

697
00:21:50,450 --> 00:21:53,210
Come this way

698
00:21:53,210 --> 00:21:54,240
Follow me

699
00:21:57,000 --> 00:21:58,400
The principal is...

700
00:21:59,170 --> 00:22:01,930
It surely got really quiet in here

701
00:22:01,930 --> 00:22:04,680
I don't like this silence
- It's not pleasant, I guess

702
00:22:02,110 --> 00:22:05,930
After this

703
00:22:02,110 --> 00:22:05,930
The last class work from principal Hamada!!

704
00:22:06,450 --> 00:22:11,760
HOT BLOODED!!

705
00:22:08,000 --> 00:22:11,760
HAMADA'S CRAM SCHOOL!!

706
00:22:12,480 --> 00:22:14,990
Because of his love for his unskilled students

707
00:22:14,990 --> 00:22:18,860
Principal Hamada can now only turn into a demon

708
00:22:19,610 --> 00:22:21,410
Get in here

709
00:22:22,120 --> 00:22:22,560
Ok

710
00:22:22,800 --> 00:22:25,770
I'm entering!
- Excuse us!

711
00:22:25,770 --> 00:22:28,570
Don't get away from this bordered area

712
00:22:28,570 --> 00:22:30,490
Exiting from it isn't allowed

713
00:22:29,870 --> 00:22:30,490
Yes sir

714
00:22:31,520 --> 00:22:32,490
Ok?

715
00:22:34,370 --> 00:22:37,970
I used to do this back then

716
00:22:35,520 --> 00:22:36,560
What?

717
00:22:36,560 --> 00:22:37,970
Back then..?

718
00:22:37,970 --> 00:22:41,130
What is it?

719
00:22:38,920 --> 00:22:41,130
I'm sure the vice knows it too, right?

720
00:22:41,130 --> 00:22:43,650
Back then, with a wet towel...

721
00:22:43,650 --> 00:22:44,570
Our principal...

722
00:22:44,570 --> 00:22:48,650
Used to beat his little sister up

723
00:22:48,650 --> 00:22:50,410
His sister...?
- Just sometimes

724
00:22:51,210 --> 00:22:52,410
Yeah with

725
00:22:52,410 --> 00:22:53,600
Towels for bath

726
00:22:53,920 --> 00:22:54,810
Sometimes, yeah

727
00:22:54,810 --> 00:22:57,360
Sometimes...?
- His sister...?

728
00:22:57,360 --> 00:22:59,960
She screamed like "DJA! DJA!"

729
00:23:00,640 --> 00:23:01,600
I mean, his sister

730
00:23:03,560 --> 00:23:04,800
What's going on?!

731
00:23:04,800 --> 00:23:08,860
What's wrong, principal?!
- It hurts!!    - What's going on?!

732
00:23:08,860 --> 00:23:12,120
Stop!
- It hurts!

733
00:23:12,290 --> 00:23:17,800
HOT BLOODED!!

734
00:23:13,920 --> 00:23:17,800
HAMADA'S CRAM SCHOOL!!

735
00:23:18,050 --> 00:23:19,800
So, what are you lacking?

736
00:23:20,800 --> 00:23:23,010
"I wanted to see a bond or such!"

737
00:23:23,610 --> 00:23:26,610
We wanted to see you guys stand up for each other more

738
00:23:26,610 --> 00:23:28,840
We wanted you to value your comrades more

739
00:23:28,840 --> 00:23:30,730
Someone covering for someone else

740
00:23:30,730 --> 00:23:32,610
That's the kind of feeling

741
00:23:32,610 --> 00:23:33,920
Our principal wanted

742
00:23:33,920 --> 00:23:34,900
What are you doing?

743
00:23:34,900 --> 00:23:36,480
Thinking only about yourselves

744
00:23:36,480 --> 00:23:38,050
You won't become a president

745
00:23:38,050 --> 00:23:39,960
Don't you want to...?

746
00:23:41,000 --> 00:23:43,330
Well, actually...

747
00:23:43,330 --> 00:23:47,400
I mean, some of them want to, others don't want to

748
00:23:48,400 --> 00:23:50,000
Which one is it?

749
00:23:50,000 --> 00:23:55,000
We don't... want to
- You don't?   - We don't

750
00:23:56,090 --> 00:24:03,930
HOT BLOODED!!
