1
00:00:01,130 --> 00:00:06,690
Murakami Shoji's classroom series started without anyone wanting it

2
00:00:09,870 --> 00:00:12,100
In addition to the low ratings every time

3
00:00:12,100 --> 00:00:15,400
The guest star took over the lead role

4
00:00:16,300 --> 00:00:18,130
What will await us today?

5
00:00:21,300 --> 00:00:23,100
Matsumoto san, the hell's that?

6
00:00:24,530 --> 00:00:25,970
You see, today

7
00:00:27,270 --> 00:00:27,570
Well

8
00:00:27,570 --> 00:00:29,170
I don't know if I like it or not

9
00:00:29,930 --> 00:00:30,700
Shoji san's

10
00:00:30,700 --> 00:00:32,270
We've had enough already...

11
00:00:32,330 --> 00:00:33,000
Not again

12
00:00:33,000 --> 00:00:34,470
We had enough of it...

13
00:00:34,460 --> 00:00:36,870
I heard that there was a lot of discussions going on

14
00:00:36,870 --> 00:00:38,530
Deciding it to be Dracula Class

15
00:00:39,460 --> 00:00:41,890
Why are we doing Dracula in the middle of the day?

16
00:00:41,890 --> 00:00:43,760
Well, today is a rare occasion of a good weather

17
00:00:43,770 --> 00:00:44,430
That's right

18
00:00:45,200 --> 00:00:48,000
With this guy's bad luck...

19
00:00:48,000 --> 00:00:50,560
He was very particular about the location this time

20
00:00:50,570 --> 00:00:51,100
Really?

21
00:00:52,030 --> 00:00:55,730
If there's a field, a lawn, or a loophole...

22
00:00:55,900 --> 00:00:57,030
That really doesn't matter

23
00:00:57,030 --> 00:00:59,190
For us, there are fields and open spaces

24
00:00:59,200 --> 00:01:01,560
It would be great if it got lost in there somewhere

25
00:01:13,370 --> 00:01:15,260
You can't swallow with this thing

26
00:01:15,400 --> 00:01:17,100
How Dracula even lives like that?

27
00:01:17,100 --> 00:01:18,330
Today's weather is great

28
00:01:18,800 --> 00:01:20,230
The sun shines so bright

29
00:01:21,000 --> 00:01:23,550
If I play Dracula today, I'll just vanish

30
00:01:25,770 --> 00:01:26,570
It's like

31
00:01:26,800 --> 00:01:28,100
Dracula's leisure

32
00:01:28,530 --> 00:01:30,130
What a beautiful sight

33
00:01:31,000 --> 00:01:32,300
Wouldn't he normally die?

34
00:01:33,370 --> 00:01:34,630
If he'd been a real Dracula

35
00:01:37,270 --> 00:01:39,490
He would have absolutely died

36
00:01:40,630 --> 00:01:41,430
He's so white

37
00:01:42,730 --> 00:01:44,490
Like like a wall paint

38
00:01:45,670 --> 00:01:47,110
Is that really Dracula?

39
00:01:50,170 --> 00:01:52,900
You're face is so pale... Good morning!

40
00:01:56,900 --> 00:01:59,290
The kite is quite high up

41
00:01:59,570 --> 00:02:00,830
He's quite skillful

42
00:02:01,670 --> 00:02:03,460
What are you doing?

43
00:02:07,770 --> 00:02:09,670
That's a kite, right?

44
00:02:10,030 --> 00:02:12,870
I...I didn't know where should we meet

45
00:02:17,160 --> 00:02:21,570
The person who forgot the meeting place was Murakami Shoji

46
00:02:22,830 --> 00:02:24,600
You look so bright

47
00:02:24,830 --> 00:02:27,260
You look like you're terribly backlit

48
00:02:27,270 --> 00:02:28,770
You're so off

49
00:02:30,130 --> 00:02:30,930
Well today...

50
00:02:32,830 --> 00:02:34,870
I told my manager that it's too sunny today

51
00:02:35,500 --> 00:02:36,400
But I was made to

52
00:02:37,230 --> 00:02:38,900
Even if it's sunny, you'll do it

53
00:02:41,100 --> 00:02:42,700
That's what my manager told me

54
00:02:42,770 --> 00:02:44,370
My boss

55
00:02:48,070 --> 00:02:48,870
I'll have to do it

56
00:02:49,630 --> 00:02:50,430
It's so tough...

57
00:02:53,000 --> 00:02:54,200
That sounds scary...

58
00:02:56,130 --> 00:02:58,260
We don't have time to discuss that

59
00:02:58,270 --> 00:02:59,860
We're doing Dracula Class today

60
00:02:59,870 --> 00:03:01,800
My teeth still don't fit in

61
00:03:03,030 --> 00:03:04,930
I need to ask my doctor Fukada

62
00:03:05,200 --> 00:03:07,060
To fix the last ones

63
00:03:08,130 --> 00:03:09,800
I have only temporary teeth now

64
00:03:09,800 --> 00:03:13,890
I can't bite my wife's shoulder properly

65
00:03:14,030 --> 00:03:14,990
Bite her shoulder?

66
00:03:15,100 --> 00:03:17,000
Yes, when I try to do it

67
00:03:17,230 --> 00:03:18,470
We see

68
00:03:20,030 --> 00:03:21,330
I can't bite it well

69
00:03:21,830 --> 00:03:23,500
So you can't her shoulder well?

70
00:03:25,530 --> 00:03:27,890
This time, I've added gameplay element

71
00:03:27,930 --> 00:03:28,870
That's right

72
00:03:28,930 --> 00:03:29,770
Hama chan, you say

73
00:03:30,300 --> 00:03:32,600
"When big brother comes, our ratings plunge" and

74
00:03:32,970 --> 00:03:33,930
"He's scary" and

75
00:03:34,870 --> 00:03:37,100
"I came all the way there last week"

76
00:03:37,300 --> 00:03:39,770
I hear that too often

77
00:03:43,000 --> 00:03:45,130
First, Dracula's basics

78
00:03:45,870 --> 00:03:47,970
Learning how to suck blood

79
00:03:48,830 --> 00:03:51,000
How many cc did I suck in!?

80
00:03:54,560 --> 00:03:56,170
Without further ado, let's start

81
00:03:56,170 --> 00:03:57,170
Our first game!

82
00:03:57,170 --> 00:03:58,200
Murakami san, please!

83
00:03:58,200 --> 00:03:59,000
Yes!

84
00:03:59,230 --> 00:04:00,200
First of all

85
00:04:00,830 --> 00:04:01,670
He's that kind of guy...

86
00:04:02,630 --> 00:04:03,500
What's that?

87
00:04:03,800 --> 00:04:05,900
That's something very different...

88
00:04:07,130 --> 00:04:08,330
That's part of our game

89
00:04:08,900 --> 00:04:11,700
You see the red substance?

90
00:04:11,800 --> 00:04:13,100
What do you think is that?

91
00:04:13,200 --> 00:04:14,430
Isn't it a tomato juice?

92
00:04:14,600 --> 00:04:15,430
You're spot on

93
00:04:16,630 --> 00:04:17,470
This blood

94
00:04:18,170 --> 00:04:19,500
You should calculate

95
00:04:20,000 --> 00:04:21,030
how many cc there

96
00:04:21,330 --> 00:04:22,800
by your own intuition

97
00:04:22,800 --> 00:04:24,830
That's too difficult!

98
00:04:24,930 --> 00:04:26,430
That's too tough!

99
00:04:26,870 --> 00:04:28,200
I don't get it...

100
00:04:28,230 --> 00:04:29,130
Understand?

101
00:04:29,800 --> 00:04:30,600
Zero

102
00:04:30,670 --> 00:04:31,470
Ma-chan

103
00:04:31,630 --> 00:04:32,900
Please

104
00:04:33,670 --> 00:04:34,960
96 cc

105
00:04:36,000 --> 00:04:37,300
That's quite high...

106
00:04:39,200 --> 00:04:39,900
Start!

107
00:04:41,200 --> 00:04:42,700
Use your intuition!

108
00:04:44,160 --> 00:04:45,370
Make it 96 cc

109
00:04:46,160 --> 00:04:47,860
Isn't it too long?

110
00:04:48,000 --> 00:04:48,700
How was it?

111
00:04:50,300 --> 00:04:51,800
I think I did it

112
00:04:52,630 --> 00:04:54,530
92 cc!

113
00:04:55,500 --> 00:04:56,300
Amazing!

114
00:04:58,230 --> 00:05:00,900
If this goes this way, you'll be an honors student

115
00:05:00,900 --> 00:05:01,700
Thank you very much!

116
00:05:01,700 --> 00:05:04,960
I've never seen anyone drink so close on the first try before

117
00:05:05,270 --> 00:05:06,070
Let's continue

118
00:05:07,400 --> 00:05:08,900
Yamasaki, try it

119
00:05:09,100 --> 00:05:09,730
Do your best!

120
00:05:09,730 --> 00:05:12,990
Do it good as well

121
00:05:13,230 --> 00:05:14,300
Yama chan do your...

122
00:05:14,830 --> 00:05:15,630
What?

123
00:05:16,400 --> 00:05:19,530
Drink 1 liter of it

124
00:05:22,070 --> 00:05:23,170
Do it, Yama chan

125
00:05:23,570 --> 00:05:24,330
Wait a minute

126
00:05:24,530 --> 00:05:25,570
Drink it, drink it

127
00:05:26,030 --> 00:05:27,470
But that's different from before

128
00:05:27,470 --> 00:05:30,200
Shouldn't we identify cc woth our intuition?

129
00:05:30,530 --> 00:05:31,330
You again...

130
00:05:32,300 --> 00:05:33,970
Your sister said the same thing

131
00:05:36,200 --> 00:05:38,470
When she wanted to become Dracula...

132
00:05:38,800 --> 00:05:42,760
You, like the guy who works part-time at the convenience store around the corner

133
00:05:42,830 --> 00:05:44,100
You and your family...

134
00:05:45,130 --> 00:05:46,560
You all can't measure

135
00:05:47,600 --> 00:05:49,460
Drink as much, as I tell you

136
00:05:49,460 --> 00:05:50,200
I understand

137
00:05:50,330 --> 00:05:51,130
I understand

138
00:05:52,800 --> 00:05:56,130
Drink it, drink it, Yama chan! 1liter

139
00:05:58,830 --> 00:06:00,400
Do your best!

140
00:06:01,530 --> 00:06:02,330
He goes for it!

141
00:06:04,070 --> 00:06:05,930
Vacuum it all out of the glass

142
00:06:06,870 --> 00:06:07,930
Don't stop

143
00:06:08,230 --> 00:06:09,570
Go for it!

144
00:06:10,100 --> 00:06:12,800
Yama chan, drink it all!

145
00:06:12,900 --> 00:06:14,100
Do it well!

146
00:06:14,270 --> 00:06:15,970
Go for it! You're amazing!

147
00:06:19,070 --> 00:06:20,190
He made no progress...

148
00:06:20,400 --> 00:06:23,560
Wait a moment, I can't drink that much...

149
00:06:24,070 --> 00:06:25,300
Ah, thank you very much...

150
00:06:25,770 --> 00:06:27,230
He's so gentle...

151
00:06:28,000 --> 00:06:29,330
Yama chan, what was that?

152
00:06:30,700 --> 00:06:32,530
But I've managed to drink this much

153
00:06:33,100 --> 00:06:33,900
Listen

154
00:06:36,930 --> 00:06:38,400
If you visit once

155
00:06:39,730 --> 00:06:42,060
most prestigious restaurant in Ginza

156
00:06:42,630 --> 00:06:44,830
You're that type who'd never go there again

157
00:06:44,830 --> 00:06:46,230
What are you talking about?

158
00:06:52,930 --> 00:06:54,130
Your teeth fell off

159
00:06:54,370 --> 00:06:55,330
Are you alright?

160
00:06:56,170 --> 00:06:57,680
I'll take them off for now

161
00:06:57,970 --> 00:06:59,330
Really, when I wear them

162
00:07:00,000 --> 00:07:02,200
When I wear them for too long, they wear out

163
00:07:02,200 --> 00:07:03,100
I can't wear them

164
00:07:03,700 --> 00:07:05,500
And nothing funny comes to mind

165
00:07:05,970 --> 00:07:06,860
Then take it off

166
00:07:07,500 --> 00:07:09,430
To suck the human blood

167
00:07:09,600 --> 00:07:12,870
It is important to know certain approaches

168
00:07:14,000 --> 00:07:14,800
In the village

169
00:07:14,930 --> 00:07:16,170
when Dracula appears

170
00:07:16,770 --> 00:07:18,060
Well, you know the rest

171
00:07:18,170 --> 00:07:18,970
That's

172
00:07:19,370 --> 00:07:20,500
pretty well-known

173
00:07:20,870 --> 00:07:21,670
That's why

174
00:07:21,670 --> 00:07:24,330
In the meantime, we have villagers inside their houses

175
00:07:24,830 --> 00:07:28,100
Whom we need to lure out, or make them let us in

176
00:07:28,670 --> 00:07:29,270
This time

177
00:07:29,270 --> 00:07:30,770
We will practice this process

178
00:07:32,270 --> 00:07:33,070
Ma-chan

179
00:07:33,070 --> 00:07:35,160
Can you do a housewife? A housewife? Fine

180
00:07:35,430 --> 00:07:37,490
We need to add one thing

181
00:07:37,730 --> 00:07:38,530
Put this on

182
00:07:40,000 --> 00:07:41,070
You're a housewife

183
00:07:42,570 --> 00:07:43,370
Your two kids

184
00:07:43,730 --> 00:07:44,700
went outside

185
00:07:45,370 --> 00:07:46,360
And your husband

186
00:07:46,600 --> 00:07:49,100
Is on a business trip

187
00:07:50,270 --> 00:07:51,430
And Dracula comes here

188
00:07:51,600 --> 00:07:53,130
Don't open the door! It's so late...

189
00:07:55,670 --> 00:07:56,470
Yes?

190
00:07:57,430 --> 00:07:58,630
Excuse me, Miss

191
00:07:59,400 --> 00:08:00,300
Who's that?

192
00:08:01,330 --> 00:08:02,300
You see...

193
00:08:02,570 --> 00:08:04,270
I've just recently moved in

194
00:08:05,000 --> 00:08:06,400
My name's Takamiya

195
00:08:06,500 --> 00:08:07,330
Takamiya san?

196
00:08:07,470 --> 00:08:09,850
Actually, I went fishing the other day

197
00:08:10,230 --> 00:08:14,460
I fried lots of mackerel and decided to give it to my neighbors

198
00:08:14,470 --> 00:08:15,270
Yes

199
00:08:15,260 --> 00:08:16,460
I brought some with me

200
00:08:16,470 --> 00:08:17,390
A mackerel?

201
00:08:17,390 --> 00:08:21,460
We're fine, we don't really need it. I'm sorry, thank you very much

202
00:08:21,470 --> 00:08:21,900
Wait!

203
00:08:21,900 --> 00:08:22,870
Please wait a moment

204
00:08:23,030 --> 00:08:24,470
In addition to mackerel

205
00:08:24,570 --> 00:08:26,460
I've brought seasonal baby squid

206
00:08:26,470 --> 00:08:27,630
With all these sea food

207
00:08:27,630 --> 00:08:29,270
We really don't need any

208
00:08:29,530 --> 00:08:30,630
No need to worry about us

209
00:08:31,130 --> 00:08:32,070
Miss, wait a moment

210
00:08:32,530 --> 00:08:33,930
Can I borrow some gas?

211
00:08:36,230 --> 00:08:37,800
No, please wait, Miss

212
00:08:38,230 --> 00:08:39,030
Wait a moment

213
00:08:39,200 --> 00:08:40,430
Can you lend it to me?

214
00:08:40,430 --> 00:08:41,270
What is it?

215
00:08:41,270 --> 00:08:42,070
Well, you see

216
00:08:42,170 --> 00:08:44,220
That thing started today...

217
00:08:45,770 --> 00:08:46,630
Listen...

218
00:08:47,670 --> 00:08:50,790
Excuse me, could you open the door?

219
00:08:54,230 --> 00:08:56,330
That means, we're done here

220
00:08:56,470 --> 00:08:59,100
Even the ship says that it's over

221
00:08:59,900 --> 00:09:03,170
Yamasaki took the role of Dracula

222
00:09:03,700 --> 00:09:04,630
How will it go?

223
00:09:05,600 --> 00:09:06,400
Listen

224
00:09:06,400 --> 00:09:08,080
Make me open the door

225
00:09:08,100 --> 00:09:09,660
I need to make you let me in?

226
00:09:09,670 --> 00:09:10,430
That's right

227
00:09:10,430 --> 00:09:11,370
That's difficult

228
00:09:11,870 --> 00:09:13,200
Any help is fine

229
00:09:13,200 --> 00:09:13,870
I understand

230
00:09:13,870 --> 00:09:17,700
This time, the housewife doesn't care about any celebrities

231
00:09:17,700 --> 00:09:19,030
I just want to make her open

232
00:09:20,430 --> 00:09:21,230
It's cold...

233
00:09:22,870 --> 00:09:23,670
Excuse me!

234
00:09:24,070 --> 00:09:24,630
Excuse me!

235
00:09:24,630 --> 00:09:25,530
I'm sorry!

236
00:09:25,530 --> 00:09:28,430
Please, listen, I'm about to be attacked, please open the door!

237
00:09:28,430 --> 00:09:31,230
I'm sorry, but I'm now

238
00:09:31,330 --> 00:09:33,390
I'm also about to be attacked

239
00:09:35,300 --> 00:09:36,500
He absolutely failed

240
00:09:36,500 --> 00:09:37,500
No way!

241
00:09:37,500 --> 00:09:38,300
Please!

242
00:09:38,370 --> 00:09:39,330
No, please listen

243
00:09:40,070 --> 00:09:40,700
Excuse me

244
00:09:40,700 --> 00:09:41,500
Yes!

245
00:09:41,570 --> 00:09:42,530
Yamasaki

246
00:09:42,730 --> 00:09:46,900
If you'll keep doing it like that, you're going to scare the hell out of the people inside

247
00:09:46,900 --> 00:09:48,470
That's why you should have

248
00:09:48,530 --> 00:09:53,300
made the housewife go "What?" just if a celebrity came here

249
00:09:53,300 --> 00:09:54,430
You want me to say that?

250
00:09:56,300 --> 00:09:57,870
Just if you were a celebrity

251
00:09:58,030 --> 00:10:02,430
Alright, this time she is a big fan of Kenichi Mikawa (1960's transgender enka singer)

252
00:10:02,430 --> 00:10:03,230
I see

253
00:10:03,300 --> 00:10:03,870
That's why

254
00:10:03,870 --> 00:10:05,490
Make her open that door

255
00:10:05,500 --> 00:10:06,300
I understand

256
00:10:06,870 --> 00:10:08,630
My husband is quite late...

257
00:10:09,900 --> 00:10:10,700
Good eveing

258
00:10:13,430 --> 00:10:14,800
Who is that?

259
00:10:15,430 --> 00:10:16,700
It's Mikawa

260
00:10:19,770 --> 00:10:21,000
Mikawa who?

261
00:10:22,000 --> 00:10:23,930
It's Mikawa Kenichi

262
00:10:26,430 --> 00:10:27,230
What?

263
00:10:28,030 --> 00:10:28,830
Miss?

264
00:10:29,900 --> 00:10:33,030
Shogo Hamada san didn't come? (late 1970's rock singer)

265
00:10:33,030 --> 00:10:33,830
Good evening

266
00:10:35,270 --> 00:10:36,500
It's Hamada Shogo

267
00:10:39,300 --> 00:10:40,100
Miss?

268
00:10:43,870 --> 00:10:44,830
What was that?

269
00:10:45,530 --> 00:10:48,480
I think he's nervous

270
00:10:49,000 --> 00:10:51,170
He really tries he's best

271
00:10:51,470 --> 00:10:53,200
Yama chan, that was unfortunate

272
00:10:53,200 --> 00:10:54,330
Although, you tried hard

273
00:10:54,870 --> 00:10:57,150
Watch and learn a bit more from other people

274
00:10:57,800 --> 00:10:58,800
Endo, try next

275
00:11:00,030 --> 00:11:00,830
Me?

276
00:11:00,830 --> 00:11:01,630
Try doing it

277
00:11:02,630 --> 00:11:05,200
You should already know so far all the good and bad points

278
00:11:05,200 --> 00:11:06,530
But you would

279
00:11:07,000 --> 00:11:08,100
Absolutely not open it

280
00:11:08,100 --> 00:11:09,770
I have no ideas

281
00:11:09,770 --> 00:11:10,570
Find a way

282
00:11:11,500 --> 00:11:13,130
Will the housewife open?

283
00:11:13,900 --> 00:11:14,700
Well

284
00:11:15,300 --> 00:11:16,700
My husband is quite late

285
00:11:18,170 --> 00:11:18,970
Darling?

286
00:11:19,130 --> 00:11:20,610
Have you returned?

287
00:11:24,170 --> 00:11:24,970
Are you back?

288
00:11:27,160 --> 00:11:29,160
That's completely different!

289
00:11:30,870 --> 00:11:32,400
Isn't he a Dracula?

290
00:11:32,460 --> 00:11:35,160
He opened it straight away...

291
00:11:36,600 --> 00:11:37,630
The next is

292
00:11:37,700 --> 00:11:41,600
Quick push quiz corner!!

293
00:11:42,800 --> 00:11:45,430
The quiz is the best way to get high ratings right now

294
00:11:45,430 --> 00:11:46,230
That's right

295
00:11:47,000 --> 00:11:48,870
With ratings in mind

296
00:11:49,200 --> 00:11:51,870
Let's learn some Dracula trivia

297
00:11:53,100 --> 00:11:54,470
Question 1

298
00:11:55,430 --> 00:11:59,580
Dracula was modeled on a real-life European aristocrat

299
00:11:59,830 --> 00:12:02,070
But what country did he come from?

300
00:12:03,030 --> 00:12:04,690
Yama chan? Engalnd!

301
00:12:06,770 --> 00:12:08,330
Tanaka kun? Romania!

302
00:12:12,000 --> 00:12:12,800
Amazing!

303
00:12:13,200 --> 00:12:14,170
I knew it!

304
00:12:14,930 --> 00:12:15,730
Let's go

305
00:12:15,730 --> 00:12:20,500
Dracula has shed a tear once

306
00:12:20,800 --> 00:12:22,530
When did that happen?

307
00:12:22,630 --> 00:12:23,900
Come on

308
00:12:24,630 --> 00:12:26,630
Well, I think...

309
00:12:27,900 --> 00:12:28,570
It was when...

310
00:12:28,570 --> 00:12:30,910
When a cross was shown to him

311
00:12:33,800 --> 00:12:35,670
When he was sprayed with holy water?

312
00:12:37,530 --> 00:12:39,130
Time's up

313
00:12:39,970 --> 00:12:40,800
He cried?

314
00:12:42,370 --> 00:12:44,800
When his little sister was hit by a trailer

315
00:12:45,100 --> 00:12:46,970
Is that really true?

316
00:12:47,070 --> 00:12:48,470
He was shocked

317
00:12:48,470 --> 00:12:50,330
When trailer hit?

318
00:12:50,730 --> 00:12:52,000
Yes... Next question!

319
00:12:52,700 --> 00:12:56,130
One time, Dracula laughed really hard

320
00:12:56,600 --> 00:12:58,430
When did that happen?

321
00:12:58,800 --> 00:13:00,370
When did it happen?

322
00:13:01,200 --> 00:13:03,270
When he was pissed off of the bloodsucking

323
00:13:04,930 --> 00:13:05,670
I see...

324
00:13:05,670 --> 00:13:07,370
When he laughed a lot?

325
00:13:07,530 --> 00:13:08,470
Yes?

326
00:13:09,730 --> 00:13:12,390
When he couldn't suck out any blood at all

327
00:13:13,500 --> 00:13:14,670
That's quite hilarious

328
00:13:15,370 --> 00:13:16,630
I wonder if that's possible...

329
00:13:17,130 --> 00:13:18,430
Here's the answer

330
00:13:19,600 --> 00:13:23,060
When he asked for miso soup, but got ordinary soup

331
00:13:24,200 --> 00:13:25,800
That's impossible

332
00:13:26,070 --> 00:13:27,200
Is that for real?

333
00:13:27,200 --> 00:13:28,600
That's absolutely true!

334
00:13:31,630 --> 00:13:34,030
Of course he had funny incidents

335
00:13:34,430 --> 00:13:35,930
He was like "The hell's that?"

336
00:13:35,930 --> 00:13:36,770
Next one

337
00:13:37,500 --> 00:13:38,300
Next up is

338
00:13:38,700 --> 00:13:40,370
Mistake-finding quiz!!

339
00:13:41,670 --> 00:13:42,530
Spot a mistake

340
00:13:42,530 --> 00:13:43,400
I'll be doing it

341
00:13:43,870 --> 00:13:44,670
Alright?

342
00:13:44,830 --> 00:13:47,360
I will be going from behind this curtain

343
00:13:48,530 --> 00:13:51,000
To the one over there

344
00:13:52,630 --> 00:13:53,700
While I'm running

345
00:13:54,430 --> 00:13:56,400
Find something off

346
00:13:56,570 --> 00:13:57,230
We see

347
00:13:57,230 --> 00:13:59,460
And after that, give me your answers

348
00:13:59,470 --> 00:14:01,230
Tell me what was wrong

349
00:14:01,360 --> 00:14:03,500
I'll prepare a few things right away, okay?

350
00:14:03,500 --> 00:14:04,770
That's quite a distance...

351
00:14:05,300 --> 00:14:06,170
Wait a moment

352
00:14:06,170 --> 00:14:07,490
How many time will you run?

353
00:14:07,530 --> 00:14:08,700
I can't tell you that

354
00:14:09,130 --> 00:14:10,570
So, remember, please

355
00:14:12,400 --> 00:14:14,670
That's a huge distance...

356
00:14:16,400 --> 00:14:19,030
Aiming to further improve knowledge skills

357
00:14:19,400 --> 00:14:21,430
They are challenged to find mistakes

358
00:14:24,100 --> 00:14:26,570
We're ready. Here I come!

359
00:14:29,730 --> 00:14:30,530
Start!

360
00:14:44,530 --> 00:14:45,600
The hell's that?

361
00:14:57,270 --> 00:14:58,070
Did you get it?

362
00:15:00,530 --> 00:15:01,330
Did you get it?

363
00:15:02,070 --> 00:15:03,270
Can you run one more time?

364
00:15:03,270 --> 00:15:04,660
Did you spot anything?

365
00:15:05,170 --> 00:15:06,600
Can you run one more time?

366
00:15:07,900 --> 00:15:08,870
Fine

367
00:15:09,370 --> 00:15:11,330
Yes, please!

368
00:15:12,970 --> 00:15:13,770
Start!

369
00:15:19,370 --> 00:15:21,070
He's like running for his life

370
00:15:24,600 --> 00:15:27,190
I wonder, where's a mistake? I can't see anything...

371
00:15:27,430 --> 00:15:28,230
I don't know

372
00:15:28,300 --> 00:15:29,700
I can't really tell...

373
00:15:42,230 --> 00:15:43,570
He's done

374
00:15:48,070 --> 00:15:49,430
You're so fast today!

375
00:15:49,430 --> 00:15:50,930
With your running

376
00:15:51,570 --> 00:15:53,960
You were too fast, we couldn't spot anything

377
00:15:57,400 --> 00:15:58,200
Did you spot any?

378
00:15:58,400 --> 00:15:59,200
Did you?

379
00:16:01,270 --> 00:16:03,030
I think your collar was out of place

380
00:16:06,370 --> 00:16:07,400
That's probably it

381
00:16:08,430 --> 00:16:09,430
My collar's the same

382
00:16:10,630 --> 00:16:11,630
Collar is the same

383
00:16:12,300 --> 00:16:13,100
Really?

384
00:16:14,700 --> 00:16:16,900
You removed your suspenders?

385
00:16:17,570 --> 00:16:18,370
That must be it!

386
00:16:20,270 --> 00:16:22,970
Are you joking?

387
00:16:23,000 --> 00:16:24,600
The hint is the sound

388
00:16:25,630 --> 00:16:27,530
From the lower half of the body

389
00:16:27,630 --> 00:16:28,430
What?

390
00:16:28,470 --> 00:16:31,050
Can't you run one more time? We didn't catch anything at all

391
00:16:31,900 --> 00:16:32,700
Lower half?

392
00:16:33,570 --> 00:16:34,370
Here I go

393
00:16:47,900 --> 00:16:50,160
Once more, please!

394
00:16:50,170 --> 00:16:52,560
Run in this direction!

395
00:16:54,070 --> 00:16:54,930
Dash, dash!

396
00:16:57,370 --> 00:16:58,170
Go, go!

397
00:16:58,270 --> 00:16:59,100
I know!

398
00:16:59,270 --> 00:17:00,570
I know! Matsumoto san?

399
00:17:03,200 --> 00:17:05,030
You're without socks?

400
00:17:05,270 --> 00:17:06,070
I see!

401
00:17:07,000 --> 00:17:08,170
You don't wear any, right?

402
00:17:09,870 --> 00:17:11,470
We don't see any socks

403
00:17:11,470 --> 00:17:12,270
That's true

404
00:17:17,400 --> 00:17:18,500
What are you doing?

405
00:17:19,230 --> 00:17:20,430
There's so much went out

406
00:17:20,430 --> 00:17:22,840
You've got such a running nose!

407
00:17:25,630 --> 00:17:26,430
It's geta (shoes)

408
00:17:28,330 --> 00:17:29,130
Really?

409
00:17:29,630 --> 00:17:30,730
Do you get it?

410
00:17:32,730 --> 00:17:33,830
I'll go for the last one

411
00:17:34,370 --> 00:17:35,170
Number two

412
00:17:36,500 --> 00:17:39,170
Mistake-search question 2

413
00:17:40,100 --> 00:17:42,370
The Count with a dashing appearance

414
00:17:43,600 --> 00:17:46,030
Where's a mistake?

415
00:17:56,270 --> 00:17:57,130
What's off?

416
00:18:00,400 --> 00:18:01,670
I have no clue...

417
00:18:02,270 --> 00:18:03,230
You wear shoes?

418
00:18:05,830 --> 00:18:06,670
He really does

419
00:18:07,630 --> 00:18:10,030
He definitely changed his footwear

420
00:18:11,770 --> 00:18:12,570
Buu...

421
00:18:12,770 --> 00:18:13,970
What do you mean?

422
00:18:14,270 --> 00:18:15,430
I carry it

423
00:18:17,700 --> 00:18:19,760
There's no such thing as a lack of luck

424
00:18:21,730 --> 00:18:22,670
Or competency

425
00:18:24,900 --> 00:18:26,270
You really have none of it

426
00:18:27,130 --> 00:18:27,730
Really

427
00:18:27,730 --> 00:18:30,170
You really have nothing of it

428
00:18:31,300 --> 00:18:33,170
CAN'T YOU JUST SHUT UP???

429
00:18:34,700 --> 00:18:35,500
SHUT UP!!!

430
00:18:36,370 --> 00:18:37,170
Let's rest

431
00:18:37,570 --> 00:18:39,000
Let's have a break

432
00:18:41,700 --> 00:18:43,270
I knew we'd be hungry

433
00:18:43,600 --> 00:18:44,470
Such meal?

434
00:18:45,000 --> 00:18:48,230
That's peperoncino with garlic

435
00:18:48,730 --> 00:18:50,400
What a great meat smell!

436
00:18:53,270 --> 00:18:54,100
Sorry

437
00:18:55,430 --> 00:18:56,400
Thanks for the meal

438
00:19:03,030 --> 00:19:04,830
The hell you're eating garlic?

439
00:19:06,100 --> 00:19:07,100
You can't eat garlic

440
00:19:08,630 --> 00:19:09,600
No, but the Count...

441
00:19:10,070 --> 00:19:11,200
What are you eating?

442
00:19:11,770 --> 00:19:12,800
Peperoncino

443
00:19:13,270 --> 00:19:15,880
Do you impose that I'm selficino?

444
00:19:17,770 --> 00:19:19,170
You think so?

445
00:19:20,670 --> 00:19:23,660
What do you think Yama chan

446
00:19:23,660 --> 00:19:25,430
Our events are a bit too long?

447
00:19:25,430 --> 00:19:26,500
That's right

448
00:19:26,490 --> 00:19:27,760
When you've mentioned it

449
00:19:27,770 --> 00:19:28,270
That's right

450
00:19:28,270 --> 00:19:29,630
They could be shorter

451
00:19:30,130 --> 00:19:32,500
I've already said this at the meeting too

452
00:19:32,630 --> 00:19:35,100
We don't need such long ones now

453
00:19:35,670 --> 00:19:38,770
There's five of them after all

454
00:19:38,970 --> 00:19:40,990
I don't know what their reaction will be

455
00:19:41,000 --> 00:19:41,800
You know...

456
00:19:42,400 --> 00:19:44,960
And there's four of us here

457
00:19:45,130 --> 00:19:45,930
A scriptwriter

458
00:19:46,230 --> 00:19:47,070
And a director

459
00:19:47,700 --> 00:19:50,600
There are things that I want to say, but can't

460
00:19:50,830 --> 00:19:51,900
That's what I mean

461
00:19:52,270 --> 00:19:54,260
And they also want to leave

462
00:19:54,430 --> 00:19:57,220
How many other classroom ideas do you have?

463
00:19:58,100 --> 00:19:59,370
Well, I bring a lot of stuff

464
00:20:00,570 --> 00:20:01,370
For classes

465
00:20:02,600 --> 00:20:04,270
I'm thinking about 30 more

466
00:20:04,300 --> 00:20:06,000
That's impressive... Really?

467
00:20:06,230 --> 00:20:08,800
Shoji san, do you have any new planned?

468
00:20:09,000 --> 00:20:11,770
Ninja Class, part 2

469
00:20:12,170 --> 00:20:14,890
You want us to do it again?

470
00:20:16,930 --> 00:20:17,730
The Green Beret

471
00:20:18,300 --> 00:20:19,700
We've done that already

472
00:20:20,170 --> 00:20:21,830
No, but that's part 2 as well

473
00:20:24,630 --> 00:20:27,630
Who's idea was with peperoncino?

474
00:20:27,630 --> 00:20:28,630
Peperoncino...

475
00:20:28,900 --> 00:20:29,900
I'm selficino...

476
00:20:30,000 --> 00:20:30,800
As selfish

477
00:20:33,070 --> 00:20:33,870
That's

478
00:20:34,270 --> 00:20:35,070
Me...

479
00:20:38,130 --> 00:20:39,470
He really used it

480
00:20:39,970 --> 00:20:41,330
Just as I thought

481
00:20:43,600 --> 00:20:45,070
The final step

482
00:20:45,700 --> 00:20:47,130
In getting a sweet blood

483
00:20:48,200 --> 00:20:49,270
Here

484
00:20:49,570 --> 00:20:50,370
Come closer

485
00:20:51,230 --> 00:20:52,070
That's great!

486
00:20:52,230 --> 00:20:54,430
All of Dracula's hated things

487
00:20:54,600 --> 00:20:56,530
You've trained really hard

488
00:20:57,600 --> 00:21:00,430
These are Dracula's least favorite things

489
00:21:00,630 --> 00:21:02,300
Makizappa (newspaper sword)

490
00:21:02,300 --> 00:21:04,930
That's what he hates the most

491
00:21:06,300 --> 00:21:13,200
Shouldn't be a cross? No, he really hates when his head's hit with it

492
00:21:15,000 --> 00:21:16,300
Holy water

493
00:21:19,400 --> 00:21:20,200
You see

494
00:21:21,170 --> 00:21:23,000
The villagers are getting stronger

495
00:21:23,430 --> 00:21:25,580
They're already coming after us as a group

496
00:21:26,230 --> 00:21:29,380
One needs to go through many obstacles

497
00:21:29,600 --> 00:21:32,500
to return back into one's coffin

498
00:21:33,330 --> 00:21:35,100
Escape for the attack

499
00:21:35,870 --> 00:21:38,670
That's the most vital training for survival!

500
00:21:39,900 --> 00:21:40,870
Let me explain

501
00:21:41,230 --> 00:21:46,100
Escape to the coffin from the attacking villagers

502
00:21:46,430 --> 00:21:51,840
Smash through the wall of cans and go under the net

503
00:21:52,200 --> 00:21:53,600
And finally get inside

504
00:21:54,100 --> 00:21:55,960
Once you're inside, close the lid

505
00:21:56,070 --> 00:21:56,870
With that

506
00:21:56,930 --> 00:21:58,000
Meaning you're safe

507
00:21:59,500 --> 00:22:00,500
Let's do it

508
00:22:02,030 --> 00:22:03,630
Hama chan?

509
00:22:04,070 --> 00:22:04,870
Try it

510
00:22:05,730 --> 00:22:06,530
Hama chan

511
00:22:06,630 --> 00:22:07,900
Hama chan, please

512
00:22:08,800 --> 00:22:09,730
Shall I take that?

513
00:22:09,730 --> 00:22:10,930
This look good

514
00:22:11,270 --> 00:22:12,460
That will be painful

515
00:22:14,500 --> 00:22:18,800
I don't really know how shall it be done...

516
00:22:18,800 --> 00:22:20,230
Can't show me an example?

517
00:22:20,270 --> 00:22:21,070
He's right

518
00:22:21,070 --> 00:22:22,300
And then I'll do it

519
00:22:23,130 --> 00:22:23,830
Okay

520
00:22:23,830 --> 00:22:24,900
Watch carefully!

521
00:22:25,230 --> 00:22:26,030
Yes

522
00:22:26,400 --> 00:22:27,730
I'm sorry. Don't sweat it

523
00:22:28,200 --> 00:22:29,000
Will you wear it?

524
00:22:29,170 --> 00:22:29,970
Yes, I will

525
00:22:31,530 --> 00:22:33,300
Hama chan, I've got several of these

526
00:22:33,300 --> 00:22:34,030
I understand

527
00:22:34,030 --> 00:22:34,500
Yes

528
00:22:34,500 --> 00:22:36,070
If you'll need one. I understand

529
00:22:36,900 --> 00:22:40,250
Then, we're all villagers

530
00:22:40,370 --> 00:22:41,330
Wait a moment

531
00:22:41,400 --> 00:22:43,270
I'll run up to you

532
00:22:44,170 --> 00:22:44,970
Here I go!

533
00:22:45,730 --> 00:22:47,400
Destroy him with garlic

534
00:22:47,400 --> 00:22:48,500
Get ready!

535
00:22:49,460 --> 00:22:50,030
Go!

536
00:23:06,100 --> 00:23:08,000
NOW, NOW!!!

537
00:23:08,000 --> 00:23:08,900
GET THAT, DRACULA!

538
00:23:09,030 --> 00:23:10,070
GET THAT!

539
00:23:10,230 --> 00:23:11,300
it hurts... GO AWAY!!

540
00:23:11,770 --> 00:23:12,870
DRACULA GET LOST!!!

541
00:23:14,600 --> 00:23:15,400
YOU BASTARD!

542
00:23:20,600 --> 00:23:22,000
DON'T EVER COME BACK!!!

543
00:23:33,200 --> 00:23:34,000
CLOSE IT!

544
00:23:35,900 --> 00:23:37,400
YOU BASTARD!

545
00:23:40,070 --> 00:23:41,460
Serves him right

546
00:23:45,670 --> 00:23:46,470
Alright!

547
00:23:48,230 --> 00:23:49,770
He's done for good

548
00:23:49,870 --> 00:23:50,670
We've done it

549
00:23:50,830 --> 00:23:51,630
Let's head home

550
00:23:51,970 --> 00:23:52,770
Yes

551
00:23:54,630 --> 00:23:58,230
YOU DON'T KNOW HOW HOLY WATER IS SPELLED!!!

552
00:23:58,730 --> 00:24:00,770
COLD WATER, COLD WATER

553
00:24:01,030 --> 00:24:03,700
IT'S NOT WRITTEN AS A COLD WATER, YOU IDIOTS!!!
