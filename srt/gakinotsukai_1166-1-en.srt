After breakdown they're getting ready to go to Sky Tree

15
00:00:30,440 --> 00:00:34,050

19
00:00:45,440 --> 00:00:46,820
I'm exhausted!!

20
00:00:46,830 --> 00:00:49,320
Thanks for your hard work!

21
00:00:55,220 --> 00:00:57,740
I worked so hard...

22
00:00:58,540 --> 00:01:00,520
Why am I being punished?

23
00:01:00,710 --> 00:01:04,240
Then what have I...

24
00:01:04,240 --> 00:01:06,010
Done!!

25
00:01:06,010 --> 00:01:09,500
What are you expecting from me!!

26
00:01:11,740 --> 00:01:13,150
Isn't that right??

27
00:01:13,360 --> 00:01:15,880
What am I to reflect upon?

28
00:01:16,220 --> 00:01:19,240
What am I to do from now.

29
00:01:19,220 --> 00:01:20,730
You done your best!!

30
00:01:20,330 --> 00:01:22,290
I did my best!!

31
00:01:21,460 --> 00:01:22,530
To be punished!!

32
00:01:22,290 --> 00:01:25,060
You did your best!!

33
00:01:25,060 --> 00:01:30,100
You had 5 out 6, but didn't get punishment!!

34
00:01:30,870 --> 00:01:33,840
What do I reflect upon?

35
00:01:34,240 --> 00:01:38,340
15 minutes later

36
00:01:34,660 --> 00:01:36,460
Matsumoto is still not content.

37
00:01:36,440 --> 00:01:38,600
He had changed clothes.

38
00:01:38,610 --> 00:01:41,840
He headed to Matsuko in dressing room.

39
00:01:41,850 --> 00:01:43,600
Plase come in.

40
00:01:46,880 --> 00:01:49,300
Seriously you want me to go?

41
00:01:49,620 --> 00:01:51,300
What? I guess...

42
00:01:52,420 --> 00:01:55,760
I'm not sure what to expect.

43
00:01:55,760 --> 00:01:58,380
Regarding the "Karuta" cards...

44
00:01:58,640 --> 00:02:01,840
Wow, you have a nice body!!

45
00:02:01,830 --> 00:02:02,400
Yeah!!

46
00:02:02,400 --> 00:02:04,920
I'm no comparison to your body.

47
00:02:05,940 --> 00:02:08,980
You have an awesome body!!

48
00:02:08,560 --> 00:02:11,280
Not at all. let's get going!!

49
00:02:10,740 --> 00:02:11,620

50
00:02:11,880 --> 00:02:13,580
It's so hot!!

51
00:02:13,580 --> 00:02:14,910
You're so dressed!!

52
00:02:14,910 --> 00:02:17,480
Wow. My outlook on you has changed!!

53
00:02:16,920 --> 00:02:18,720
What are you saying!!

54
00:02:19,220 --> 00:02:20,990
Oh.. my!!

55
00:02:21,020 --> 00:02:23,760
I'm looking at you sexually!!

56
00:02:25,540 --> 00:02:27,040
Let me look at you!!

57
00:02:27,030 --> 00:02:28,980
Shut up, quiet.

58
00:02:28,960 --> 00:02:30,560
Quite already!!

59
00:02:30,560 --> 00:02:32,820
Have a good time... have a good one!!

60
00:02:32,060 --> 00:02:33,540
Strange, strange!!

61
00:02:33,530 --> 00:02:35,340
You're going like that?

62
00:02:35,330 --> 00:02:37,380
You look so good!!

63
00:02:37,740 --> 00:02:40,020
I'm being touched all over!!

64
00:02:40,010 --> 00:02:44,220
I'm feeling him out sexually!!

65
00:02:44,210 --> 00:02:47,060
A date... Date!!

66
00:02:47,050 --> 00:02:50,920
I won 6 cards, but.

67
00:02:50,920 --> 00:02:53,650
I don't understand the batsu game!!

68
00:02:53,650 --> 00:02:55,340
How many did you win?

69
00:02:55,320 --> 00:02:56,560
I won only one!

70
00:02:56,560 --> 00:02:59,400
Have a nice time... Have fun!!

71
00:03:00,640 --> 00:03:03,680
It's hot, it's hot!!

72
00:03:03,660 --> 00:03:05,180
It's really hot!!

73
00:03:05,880 --> 00:03:08,400
Wow, I'm looking at you differently!!

74
00:03:07,800 --> 00:03:10,040
What are you saying!

75
00:03:10,560 --> 00:03:12,120
Wonderful!!

76
00:03:12,770 --> 00:03:14,560
You look so good!!

77
00:03:14,980 --> 00:03:16,660
So hot!!

78
00:03:16,840 --> 00:03:18,260
Where is our ride?

79
00:03:17,880 --> 00:03:18,910
This one!

80
00:03:18,600 --> 00:03:20,000
You scared me!!

81
00:03:19,780 --> 00:03:22,140
I thought it was that one!!

82
00:03:22,940 --> 00:03:24,860
This one is the camera crew!

83
00:03:26,720 --> 00:03:28,690
Shall we go with that one??

84
00:03:28,190 --> 00:03:30,660
No, no, no!!

85
00:03:31,000 --> 00:03:32,680
We can't??

86
00:03:34,860 --> 00:03:37,620
A driving date to Sky Tree with Matsumoto

87
00:03:37,630 --> 00:03:45,100
Matsumoto drove for 30 minutes, with only Matsuko

88
00:03:45,660 --> 00:03:47,040
I'm getting in?

89
00:03:47,260 --> 00:03:49,520
Who else is there??

90
00:03:50,280 --> 00:03:52,110
Does this go all the way back?

91
00:03:52,100 --> 00:03:54,500
Matsumoto who is the escort will be driving.

92
00:03:54,480 --> 00:03:56,310
Matsuko will be next to him.

93
00:03:56,310 --> 00:03:58,800
I want to be in comfort.

94
00:03:56,310 --> 00:03:58,800
You gotta get comfortable.

95
00:03:59,880 --> 00:04:01,700
Is this for real??

96
00:04:03,040 --> 00:04:04,190
I have to use my imagination.

97
00:04:04,190 --> 00:04:06,830
You must not like it, eh?

98
00:04:06,830 --> 00:04:09,360
You must not want to be here?

99
00:04:09,360 --> 00:04:11,960
You don't like it right, right?

100
00:04:11,960 --> 00:04:14,450
Not that I don't like it, but...

101
00:04:15,080 --> 00:04:16,890
Why me!!

102
00:04:18,800 --> 00:04:23,480
I too was feeling uneasy, but

103
00:04:23,730 --> 00:04:25,770
after seeing your body, I was confident!!

104
00:04:27,840 --> 00:04:29,610
What the...!

105
00:04:30,360 --> 00:04:32,100
Will this go around me?

106
00:04:31,330 --> 00:04:32,570
It'll work!!

107
00:04:32,550 --> 00:04:34,770
Where is the fastener??

108
00:04:33,730 --> 00:04:35,370
Let's see.

109
00:04:36,800 --> 00:04:39,420
Oh, no, no, no!

110
00:04:40,930 --> 00:04:41,660
It's good!!

111
00:04:41,660 --> 00:04:43,160
It's all good, good!!

112
00:04:44,120 --> 00:04:45,900
You are so kind!!

113
00:04:46,360 --> 00:04:48,100
So kind!!

114
00:04:48,130 --> 00:04:49,920
I want to get there already!!

115
00:04:51,490 --> 00:04:54,170
I felt that you wanted to get this over too!!

116
00:04:54,170 --> 00:04:57,410
Not that I don't want to, but...

117
00:04:57,930 --> 00:05:00,140
They are telling us to drive on.

118
00:05:01,410 --> 00:05:05,520
Matsumoto is 49 years old.
Matsuko is 40 years old.

119
00:05:05,520 --> 00:05:07,890
The passion begins between them.

120
00:05:08,480 --> 00:05:12,090
The bystanders are clapping/cheering at us!

121
00:05:14,360 --> 00:05:16,020
We are a couple!!

122
00:05:18,940 --> 00:05:20,370
Who you waiting for??

123
00:05:20,370 --> 00:05:21,840
I'm unavailable now!

124
00:05:20,370 --> 00:05:22,960
Who are you waiting for??

125
00:05:26,500 --> 00:05:29,040
Are we really going to Sky Tree together??

126
00:05:29,040 --> 00:05:31,040
Yes we are.

127
00:05:29,540 --> 00:05:31,040
What the...

128
00:05:31,080 --> 00:05:34,410
What are we going to do  there??

129
00:05:35,020 --> 00:05:40,480
Don't go there. You make me feel sad!!

130
00:05:39,180 --> 00:05:40,990
It's not that!!

131
00:05:40,990 --> 00:05:42,820
Am I that bad?

132
00:05:43,050 --> 00:05:48,190
I don't mean it in that respect, but I'm dense.

133
00:05:49,320 --> 00:05:50,900
You can't be dense!!

134
00:05:50,900 --> 00:05:54,230
Really. I'm okay now.

135
00:05:51,450 --> 00:05:52,880
Really??

136
00:05:54,120 --> 00:05:57,880
I'm confident and alright.

137
00:05:58,700 --> 00:06:03,180
I was worried at first, what to talk to you about.

138
00:06:03,310 --> 00:06:06,810
I'm okay with silence too.

139
00:06:07,010 --> 00:06:10,580
Being together in silence is awesome!!

140
00:06:10,580 --> 00:06:11,780
Yes it is.

141
00:06:11,530 --> 00:06:13,320
It's like being married!!

142
00:06:13,320 --> 00:06:15,060
I'm fine with it.

143
00:06:15,050 --> 00:06:16,940
Wow. Why is that??!

144
00:06:17,220 --> 00:06:19,640
Why I don't know. It's beyond me!

145
00:06:19,620 --> 00:06:20,460
I'm amazed!!

146
00:06:20,460 --> 00:06:22,320
Is it your body!!

147
00:06:23,120 --> 00:06:24,080
What is it?

148
00:06:24,060 --> 00:06:26,780
Is it your solid body!!

149
00:06:26,770 --> 00:06:28,280
It's hot!!

150
00:06:29,660 --> 00:06:35,540
Frankly. I don't like being just one on one!!

151
00:06:35,770 --> 00:06:37,840
In response. Me too!!

152
00:06:37,840 --> 00:06:43,620
That's why for over 10 years.

153
00:06:43,920 --> 00:06:48,000
What's why I haven't had a dedicated person in my life.

154
00:06:48,970 --> 00:06:52,160
We don't know what's gonna turn out from this!

155
00:06:54,210 --> 00:06:56,520
Yeah... I don't mean it as Okay!

156
00:06:56,880 --> 00:06:59,600
What do you think of me?

157
00:07:04,770 --> 00:07:07,440
Wow, this is my first time here!

158
00:07:08,340 --> 00:07:12,210
First, first time here.

159
00:07:12,500 --> 00:07:14,180
Are we going up to the top?

160
00:07:14,180 --> 00:07:15,850
What the heck is this?

161
00:07:15,850 --> 00:07:16,610
It's no joke!

162
00:07:16,610 --> 00:07:18,490
What's with this!

163
00:07:18,740 --> 00:07:19,890
Why.

164
00:07:35,530 --> 00:07:39,070
It's such a hot night.

165
00:07:39,900 --> 00:07:42,160
It's awesome yeah!!

166
00:07:43,270 --> 00:07:47,880
Finally they arrive at Matsuko's destination, Tokyo Sky Tree.

167
00:07:48,780 --> 00:07:56,220
They ride the elevator to 350 meters

168
00:07:48,910 --> 00:07:51,960
The two of them get into the elevator.

169
00:07:51,950 --> 00:07:55,580
They get onto the elevator to the "observatory".
dec to 350 meters.

170
00:07:56,440 --> 00:07:58,540
How long was our drive from the studio?

171
00:07:58,520 --> 00:07:59,960
About 35 minutes...

172
00:08:00,460 --> 00:08:01,630
It was 35 minutes.

173
00:08:02,660 --> 00:08:05,540
As you pinch my nipples, the noise is distracting.

174
00:08:10,400 --> 00:08:12,670
I feel like we are going to heaven.

175
00:08:12,920 --> 00:08:16,520
Wow, 600 Km... Not really 600 Km.

176
00:08:17,880 --> 00:08:19,720
Wow, we're going really fast!

177
00:08:20,620 --> 00:08:22,350
We're here already?

178
00:08:22,510 --> 00:08:23,970
We're here?

179
00:08:24,780 --> 00:08:26,350
This is the "observatory" level.

180
00:08:26,020 --> 00:08:29,410
In about 50 seconds, they're here on the "observatory" deck.

181
00:08:29,820 --> 00:08:31,200
Please excuse me.

182
00:08:31,190 --> 00:08:32,530
No please excuse me.

183
00:08:33,400 --> 00:08:36,700
It's awesome, it's really awesome!!

184
00:08:40,870 --> 00:08:45,800
Matsuko, your nipples keep poking me.

185
00:08:46,000 --> 00:08:49,040
Yes, I've been trying to aim them at you.

186
00:08:49,410 --> 00:08:53,940
Matsuko, your body temperature seem a bit high!

187
00:08:53,950 --> 00:08:56,660
I wonder why, but it's awesome!

188
00:08:57,370 --> 00:08:58,140
What we're going to do?

189
00:08:58,150 --> 00:09:03,370
The two of them will take a commemorative photo with "Sorakara-chan"

190
00:09:04,860 --> 00:09:09,050
We will take a photo when Sorakara gives the go!

191
00:09:09,280 --> 00:09:13,780
One a one and two... We'll take your photo!

192
00:09:13,770 --> 00:09:16,210
From the Sky, We'll take a shot!

193
00:09:19,200 --> 00:09:21,240
Hey, you weren't smiling!

194
00:09:20,690 --> 00:09:22,900
I was smiling.

195
00:09:21,820 --> 00:09:23,070
Really?

196
00:09:23,740 --> 00:09:24,810
I was really smiling!

197
00:09:24,810 --> 00:09:26,330
What's the problem?

198
00:09:26,000 --> 00:09:27,570
Smiles!

199
00:09:26,950 --> 00:09:29,160
Hey you!

200
00:09:39,490 --> 00:09:43,260
A week later.

201
00:09:43,940 --> 00:09:46,730
Last week you must've been tired.

202
00:09:46,730 --> 00:09:49,300
Ah, kind of because of work!

203
00:09:48,830 --> 00:09:50,170
Yeah really!

204
00:09:49,520 --> 00:09:52,500
Really, Matsuko's high calorie.

205
00:09:54,010 --> 00:09:58,340
When we were taking a smoke break outside.

206
00:09:58,340 --> 00:10:01,210
There was the Jeep in the garage?

207
00:10:00,840 --> 00:10:01,910
Yeah, I saw it too.

208
00:10:01,750 --> 00:10:03,290
Did you go with that?

209
00:10:03,410 --> 00:10:06,020
The Jeep was for something else, right?

210
00:10:06,020 --> 00:10:06,850
For the camera crew

211
00:10:06,850 --> 00:10:08,460
The Jeep was for the camera crew.

212
00:10:07,450 --> 00:10:08,980
Oh, for the camera crew.

213
00:10:08,530 --> 00:10:10,120
The convertible one!

214
00:10:12,330 --> 00:10:14,680
After the event, the Jeep would've been better.

215
00:10:14,850 --> 00:10:15,740
Why is that?

216
00:10:15,730 --> 00:10:19,690
The van was "enclosed" and Matsuko
kept on reaching for my Crotch!

217
00:10:20,850 --> 00:10:22,340
Regardless that I was driving!

218
00:10:23,080 --> 00:10:26,680
She was feeling my "crotch", but
the camera wasn't filming there!

219
00:10:26,970 --> 00:10:29,290
And it wasn't a few times!!

220
00:10:29,890 --> 00:10:32,480
She was touching my Sky Tree!!

221
00:10:36,810 --> 00:10:38,450
The camera was rolling.

222
00:10:37,500 --> 00:10:38,450
I'm not sure.

223
00:10:38,450 --> 00:10:40,100
She must've been kidding.

224
00:10:39,020 --> 00:10:40,080
I'm not too sure.

225
00:10:40,080 --> 00:10:42,480
She wouldn't touch me when the camera wasn't rolling.

226
00:10:42,490 --> 00:10:44,220
To an extent, I think she was serious.

227
00:10:44,220 --> 00:10:48,930
Does it mean it was part of the script?

228
00:10:48,930 --> 00:10:50,530
Was Matsuko touching you knowingly?

229
00:10:50,530 --> 00:10:53,420
Matsuko knows the camera wasn't filming below my waist!

230
00:10:53,430 --> 00:10:55,400
If there was a camera here, she would've known.

231
00:10:55,400 --> 00:10:57,640
From here, below the camera wasn't filming.

232
00:10:57,640 --> 00:11:00,410
The camera was only taking your facial reaction.

233
00:11:00,410 --> 00:11:05,310
She kept on touching my Sky Tree constantly!

234
00:11:05,310 --> 00:11:06,880
I was scared!!

235
00:11:07,220 --> 00:11:10,950
I thought they were only going to film
us going to Sky Tree, and end the filming.

236
00:11:10,950 --> 00:11:14,620
They actually made us go to Sky Tree together.

237
00:11:13,540 --> 00:11:16,150
Oh, my!!

238
00:11:17,220 --> 00:11:18,960
Did you go up to the top?

239
00:11:18,960 --> 00:11:20,260
Yes to the top.

240
00:11:19,440 --> 00:11:20,960
That was great!

241
00:11:21,390 --> 00:11:22,980
What do you mean to the top?

242
00:11:22,560 --> 00:11:23,800
You wen't up?

243
00:11:23,520 --> 00:11:25,280
My psychological part...

244
00:11:26,160 --> 00:11:28,160
Like a "challenger".

245
00:11:28,600 --> 00:11:30,400
About the Sky Tree.

246
00:11:30,560 --> 00:11:32,700
We couldn't go all the way up.

247
00:11:32,700 --> 00:11:34,070
Very top is 360 meters.

248
00:11:34,070 --> 00:11:36,120
But you did go up!

249
00:11:36,420 --> 00:11:40,060
The view I anticipated from Sky Tree, was with Matsuko?

250
00:11:40,040 --> 00:11:42,010
But it was alright!

251
00:11:43,010 --> 00:11:44,320
I was afraid!

252
00:11:44,320 --> 00:11:46,000
With the anxiety, right?

253
00:11:45,980 --> 00:11:53,260
I want to see the replay of Endo's inability
of the Karuta card game.

254
00:11:53,460 --> 00:11:55,380
I would really like to see it too.

255
00:11:56,730 --> 00:11:58,700
Why was your reaction so slow!

256
00:11:57,850 --> 00:11:59,240
I'm pretty good at it, but...

257
00:11:59,230 --> 00:12:02,930
I really thought you were all so fast!!

258
00:12:03,050 --> 00:12:05,480
You were only able to get the cards closer to you.

259
00:12:05,470 --> 00:12:06,870
You are right!

260
00:12:06,870 --> 00:12:07,840
You weren't motivated.

261
00:12:07,840 --> 00:12:09,240
I was trying my best!

262
00:12:09,240 --> 00:12:11,200
I had second thoughts about you.

263
00:12:11,210 --> 00:12:15,750
Endo wants to go to Sky Tree with Matsuko?

264
00:12:15,310 --> 00:12:16,370
Intentionally!

265
00:12:16,380 --> 00:12:17,580
That's not true!

266
00:12:17,580 --> 00:12:18,640
You are gay?

267
00:12:18,880 --> 00:12:19,700
You were gay?

268
00:12:19,680 --> 00:12:22,320
No, no, not true!

269
00:12:22,320 --> 00:12:24,220
It's not possible, but...

270
00:12:24,220 --> 00:12:27,850
You didn't get much of the Karuta cards?

271
00:12:27,980 --> 00:12:29,760
It was fishy.

272
00:12:30,760 --> 00:12:31,920
Yeah fishy!

273
00:12:31,930 --> 00:12:32,970
We all know!

274
00:12:32,960 --> 00:12:36,700
Not true, maybe with Hamada-san...

275
00:12:37,040 --> 00:12:40,810
When it's read, do you look for 7-8 cards around you?

276
00:12:40,810 --> 00:12:42,170
You see it and you grab it?

277
00:12:42,180 --> 00:12:43,650
Yeah, I look near!

278
00:12:43,640 --> 00:12:47,440
That's were I'm different, I look everywhere.

279
00:12:47,770 --> 00:12:50,160
I look at all the Karuta cards.

280
00:12:50,310 --> 00:12:51,920
Why is that!!

281
00:12:51,920 --> 00:13:08,530
No sub
