First Ever Gaki No Tsukai - CHIKI CHIKI

2
00:00:02,660 --> 00:00:06,420
Calbee Potato Chips Competition!

3
00:00:09,930 --> 00:00:11,360
All that aside,

4
00:00:11,360 --> 00:00:13,900
Isn't it amazing we all showed up in the same outfit?

5
00:00:14,530 --> 00:00:16,900
These are your private clothes?

6
00:00:16,900 --> 00:00:19,090
We didn't show up in these!

7
00:00:20,020 --> 00:00:22,170
You guys did the same thing!

8
00:00:22,190 --> 00:00:23,740
These aren't our private clothes

9
00:00:23,890 --> 00:00:24,700
Oh really?

10
00:00:24,700 --> 00:00:27,330
Nobody would wear these outdated clothes!

11
00:00:27,330 --> 00:00:32,720
So everyone in today's competition you will try and guess the chip flavour

12
00:00:33,100 --> 00:00:34,320
There's this many?

13
00:00:34,320 --> 00:00:35,230
Yes exactly

14
00:00:35,230 --> 00:00:37,820
There are 72 different flavours

15
00:00:37,820 --> 00:00:39,440
You will try these

16
00:00:39,440 --> 00:00:43,980
Some of these flavours have been discontinued

17
00:00:43,980 --> 00:00:45,620
Do you eat chips normally?

18
00:00:45,470 --> 00:00:46,910
I love them, I eat them often

19
00:00:46,910 --> 00:00:48,020
Oh you eat them?

20
00:00:48,240 --> 00:00:49,260
What about Endo-san?

21
00:00:49,260 --> 00:00:50,450
Well I uhhh,

22
00:00:50,450 --> 00:00:53,520
The lightly salted, consome, the seaweed and salt

23
00:00:53,520 --> 00:00:55,140
So about 3 or 4 of them

24
00:00:55,140 --> 00:00:58,140
I really friggin love 'em

25
00:00:56,320 --> 00:00:58,140
You really like them yeah

26
00:00:58,140 --> 00:01:02,910
I've been eating like 3 bags everyday since they sold them

27
00:01:02,910 --> 00:01:04,210
Seriously!

28
00:01:04,430 --> 00:01:07,360
I couldn't understand you through that nasally voice

29
00:01:07,780 --> 00:01:14,790
Today's Gaki No Tsukai: Calbee Chips Taste Comparasion Challenge!

30
00:01:14,790 --> 00:01:27,800
They will decide between 72 specially provided Calbee varieties

31
00:01:28,210 --> 00:01:35,140
Subtitle attempt by /u/Senor_Wristband

32
00:01:35,780 --> 00:01:41,220
Normally in the Kiki games it's a personal effort,

33
00:01:41,220 --> 00:01:45,180
this time all 5 of you will try the chips

34
00:01:45,210 --> 00:01:49,940
Then all 5 of you will announce one choice

35
00:01:46,100 --> 00:01:52,240
If the guess is really terrible, there is a batsu game

36
00:01:52,900 --> 00:01:54,850
There's definitely some we know

37
00:01:56,020 --> 00:01:58,500
The ones we know are just the ones up there

38
00:01:59,070 --> 00:02:00,160
That's true

39
00:01:59,620 --> 00:02:01,810
Like look at sixty...

40
00:02:01,810 --> 00:02:03,920
Like 67 right?

41
00:02:02,000 --> 00:02:07,100
Shimane
Akaten

42
00:02:03,920 --> 00:02:06,750
What is Shimane Akaten flavour?

43
00:02:06,750 --> 00:02:08,060
It's a tempura

44
00:02:08,060 --> 00:02:08,690
What is it?

45
00:02:08,690 --> 00:02:11,600
I don't know what Akaten is, what the hell is it?

46
00:02:11,600 --> 00:02:13,420
It's a spicy fish paste...

47
00:02:13,420 --> 00:02:14,000
...Tempura

48
00:02:14,000 --> 00:02:15,230
Yes exactly

49
00:02:14,700 --> 00:02:16,610
This is the first I've heard of it

50
00:02:16,610 --> 00:02:19,470
So if you think "This is a spicy fish taste!" then it's Akaten

51
00:02:18,860 --> 00:02:20,420
How the hell would I know

52
00:02:19,870 --> 00:02:21,530
I wouldn't know that

53
00:02:21,530 --> 00:02:23,180
You 5 will decide that together

54
00:02:22,940 --> 00:02:24,460
Ah I see

55
00:02:24,460 --> 00:02:25,180
OK let's go

56
00:02:25,180 --> 00:02:28,560
First off we have these potato chips, OPEN

57
00:02:28,260 --> 00:02:29,700
They look familiar

58
00:02:28,560 --> 00:02:31,120
The colour looks a bit different

59
00:02:31,120 --> 00:02:32,510
These look pretty normal

60
00:02:32,110 --> 00:02:35,120
Woah, it feels very basic

61
00:02:35,420 --> 00:02:36,780
They're not plain

62
00:02:36,220 --> 00:02:36,780
Not plain?

63
00:02:36,780 --> 00:02:37,900
Smell them please

64
00:02:37,900 --> 00:02:39,940
They give off a plain vibe though

65
00:02:39,940 --> 00:02:40,980
Is it different?

66
00:02:40,980 --> 00:02:42,910
The chips touched his nose

67
00:02:45,300 --> 00:02:46,850
Hamada-san's -

68
00:02:46,260 --> 00:02:47,860
A little sour smell

69
00:02:47,060 --> 00:02:48,220
Acidic, acidic,

70
00:02:48,220 --> 00:02:51,220
There's some acidity

71
00:02:48,220 --> 00:02:51,220
There's some acidity

72
00:02:51,630 --> 00:02:53,890
I got it!!!!

73
00:02:53,910 --> 00:02:55,890
Could it be that one?

74
00:02:55,490 --> 00:02:57,390
You're allowed to eat them, you know

75
00:02:57,020 --> 00:02:58,220
Oh is that so?

76
00:02:58,220 --> 00:02:59,920
It's not a smell guess competition

77
00:02:58,850 --> 00:03:01,700
I got it, I got it too. I understand now too.

78
00:02:59,920 --> 00:03:00,510
Right?

79
00:03:00,740 --> 00:03:01,700
What, really?

80
00:03:01,700 --> 00:03:02,770
I got it

81
00:03:02,960 --> 00:03:05,600
Oh! Eating this much is OK?

82
00:03:05,600 --> 00:03:07,940
If you eat too many- It's bad too eat too many

83
00:03:07,940 --> 00:03:09,150
I've got it

84
00:03:08,370 --> 00:03:09,360
Hmmm?

85
00:03:10,220 --> 00:03:11,740
I've totally got it

86
00:03:10,960 --> 00:03:11,570
Oh?

87
00:03:11,570 --> 00:03:13,230
Is it an obvious one?

88
00:03:13,230 --> 00:03:15,500
Looking at the title; "Isn't it this one?"

89
00:03:14,140 --> 00:03:15,180
Same for me

90
00:03:15,180 --> 00:03:16,540
I think I got it

91
00:03:16,060 --> 00:03:16,930
I've got it

92
00:03:16,930 --> 00:03:17,940
Did you get it Endo?

93
00:03:17,940 --> 00:03:20,560
Let's try saying the number together once

94
00:03:19,870 --> 00:03:21,740
Just the number then

95
00:03:20,400 --> 00:03:21,940
Just the number? OK

96
00:03:22,110 --> 00:03:22,740
OK

97
00:03:22,740 --> 00:03:23,810
Ready, steady,

98
00:03:23,810 --> 00:03:35,530
French Salad

99
00:03:23,810 --> 00:03:35,530
French Salad

100
00:03:23,810 --> 00:03:35,530
Seitouchi Lemon

101
00:03:23,810 --> 00:03:35,530
Soy Sauce & Mayo

102
00:03:24,910 --> 00:03:26,350
All over the place

103
00:03:27,440 --> 00:03:28,340
Number 12

104
00:03:28,340 --> 00:03:29,500
Ah, but

105
00:03:29,500 --> 00:03:32,770
Matsumoto-san, Housei-san, & Tanaka-san, all 5

106
00:03:32,770 --> 00:03:34,320
Woah woah, what's that?

107
00:03:33,700 --> 00:03:34,820
Endo San?

108
00:03:34,820 --> 00:03:35,530
Six

109
00:03:35,530 --> 00:03:37,180
Soy Sauce & Mayo?!

110
00:03:35,530 --> 00:03:37,180
Soy Sauce & Mayo?!

111
00:03:35,530 --> 00:03:37,180
Soy Sauce & Mayo?!

112
00:03:35,530 --> 00:03:37,180
Soy Sauce & Mayo?!

113
00:03:36,740 --> 00:03:38,960
No way, so scary, scary!

114
00:03:38,970 --> 00:03:41,870
There's not a goddamn hint of soy sauce! Or Mayo!

115
00:03:39,680 --> 00:03:40,740
There's no way

116
00:03:41,380 --> 00:03:42,300
Neither of those

117
00:03:42,020 --> 00:03:44,610
That's why Chiaki left you!

118
00:03:44,610 --> 00:03:46,800
Who gives a shit about Chiaki right now?

119
00:03:46,800 --> 00:03:47,790
Nobody gives a shit?

120
00:03:47,790 --> 00:03:49,580
Even if nobody gives a shit,

121
00:03:49,040 --> 00:03:50,100
Soy Sauce & Mayo?

122
00:03:49,840 --> 00:03:50,700
Let's do number 5

123
00:03:50,700 --> 00:03:52,000
What about number 12?

124
00:03:51,860 --> 00:03:52,940
Hamada-san?

125
00:03:52,670 --> 00:03:53,340
Twelve

126
00:03:53,780 --> 00:03:54,800
Setouchi Lemon

127
00:03:55,010 --> 00:03:57,040
Cause if you think about sourness,

128
00:03:56,640 --> 00:03:57,820
Ah I understand,

129
00:03:57,820 --> 00:03:59,970
It's not as off as Soy Sauce & Mayo

130
00:03:59,180 --> 00:04:01,150
It could be that one

131
00:04:01,150 --> 00:04:02,140
Right?

132
00:04:01,440 --> 00:04:02,320
Could be either

133
00:04:02,320 --> 00:04:04,960
But this sourness, it's the French Salad

134
00:04:04,960 --> 00:04:05,810
I see

135
00:04:05,810 --> 00:04:08,810
It's definitely not the Soy Sauce & Mayo

136
00:04:07,490 --> 00:04:11,300
Everyone mentioned the sourness,

137
00:04:10,500 --> 00:04:11,320
Yes, yes

138
00:04:11,570 --> 00:04:14,300
Soy & Mayo has no sourness

139
00:04:12,910 --> 00:04:14,300
It's definitely wrong

140
00:04:14,500 --> 00:04:16,480
It's definitely #6 to me...

141
00:04:18,340 --> 00:04:20,210
I think I really can't get it

142
00:04:20,210 --> 00:04:21,850
12 is also ...

143
00:04:21,850 --> 00:04:22,930
Right?

144
00:04:22,060 --> 00:04:23,950
Number 12 is certainly ...

145
00:04:23,330 --> 00:04:24,860
But you know,

146
00:04:24,860 --> 00:04:27,140
I've tried Setouchi Lemon before,

147
00:04:27,140 --> 00:04:29,730
There's more of a lemon fragrence

148
00:04:30,530 --> 00:04:31,760
More citrusy?

149
00:04:32,300 --> 00:04:34,670
I've tried it once before

150
00:04:34,270 --> 00:04:35,650
There's no others?

151
00:04:35,970 --> 00:04:38,130
No more sour ones, right?

152
00:04:38,130 --> 00:04:39,840
Since you're all undecided now,

153
00:04:39,840 --> 00:04:42,960
Eliminate the choices, and choose one answer

154
00:04:42,960 --> 00:04:45,470
So the Soy & Mayo is definitely out

155
00:04:44,930 --> 00:04:46,210
Yeah it's out

156
00:04:46,350 --> 00:04:48,620
If it was that, I'd do literally anything

157
00:04:48,620 --> 00:04:49,580
Seriously?

158
00:04:49,940 --> 00:04:51,580
If it was Soy & Mayo?

159
00:04:51,580 --> 00:04:53,250
How about that Endo-san?

160
00:04:52,480 --> 00:04:53,980
OK I'll withdraw my choice

161
00:04:53,980 --> 00:04:55,550
So between 5 and 12?

162
00:04:55,550 --> 00:04:56,620
It looks that way

163
00:04:56,620 --> 00:04:59,010
Then if we consider our 4 choices,

164
00:04:59,010 --> 00:05:01,650
3/4 of us said number 5,

165
00:05:00,750 --> 00:05:02,420
OK then, I understand

166
00:05:01,390 --> 00:05:04,140
It's definitely this one, right?

167
00:05:03,620 --> 00:05:04,300
Yup

168
00:05:04,300 --> 00:05:06,610
You've decided on an answer, all together now,

169
00:05:06,610 --> 00:05:09,610
please say the answer

170
00:05:09,610 --> 00:05:14,000
The one we ate was French Salad

171
00:05:16,510 --> 00:05:17,700
Incorrect

172
00:05:18,440 --> 00:05:19,650
Totally incorrect

173
00:05:19,650 --> 00:05:20,530
Totally?!

174
00:05:20,530 --> 00:05:22,240
He said totally incorrect!

175
00:05:22,240 --> 00:05:23,070
Hold on!

176
00:05:23,070 --> 00:05:24,980
Is it twelve?!

177
00:05:24,980 --> 00:05:26,240
What about six?!

178
00:05:26,240 --> 00:05:27,380
No!

179
00:05:26,240 --> 00:05:27,380
No!

180
00:05:28,080 --> 00:05:30,140
But it's "totally incorrect"!

181
00:05:29,380 --> 00:05:31,340
There's no way it's six

182
00:05:31,700 --> 00:05:34,130
The flavour you all ate, was,

183
00:05:34,130 --> 00:05:37,950
Number 71, Oita's Soy Sauce & Kabosu!

184
00:05:37,620 --> 00:05:39,870
How the hell would we know that?

185
00:05:41,920 --> 00:05:43,280
What is this?

186
00:05:44,830 --> 00:05:46,850
it was Soy Sauce scented Kabosu flavour

187
00:05:46,850 --> 00:05:48,470
Soy sauce huh?

188
00:05:48,470 --> 00:05:49,630
Soy sauce!

189
00:05:48,470 --> 00:05:49,630
Soy sauce!

190
00:05:49,630 --> 00:05:50,720
RIGHT?!

191
00:05:49,630 --> 00:05:51,870
It's soy sauce!

192
00:05:50,930 --> 00:05:51,870
RIGHT?!

193
00:05:51,550 --> 00:05:52,690
It was soy sauce!

194
00:05:52,460 --> 00:05:54,270
We really doubted you

195
00:05:53,570 --> 00:05:56,110
Seriously smell it, it's soy sauce!

196
00:05:56,110 --> 00:05:59,730
Honestly I thought you guys were talking too much shit about me

197
00:05:59,730 --> 00:06:01,920
The smell was soy sauce

198
00:06:01,920 --> 00:06:03,250
It's soy sauce right?

199
00:06:04,020 --> 00:06:05,630
We had to smell it more

200
00:06:05,630 --> 00:06:07,680
The smell is really important

201
00:06:07,680 --> 00:06:09,710
Let's move onto the next one

202
00:06:11,060 --> 00:06:11,950
Hmmm?!

203
00:06:11,410 --> 00:06:12,290
Hmmm?!

204
00:06:11,950 --> 00:06:14,370
These might be easy to guess

205
00:06:14,040 --> 00:06:15,760
I think I see something here

206
00:06:14,930 --> 00:06:17,220
This is like mentai or something right?

207
00:06:17,220 --> 00:06:18,460
Mentai is red yeah

208
00:06:18,460 --> 00:06:20,910
Then it could also be Osaka Pickled Ginger

209
00:06:20,180 --> 00:06:21,150
Number 64

210
00:06:20,910 --> 00:06:21,800
Yeah

211
00:06:21,800 --> 00:06:23,860
Or Shimane's Akaten

212
00:06:22,690 --> 00:06:23,340
Yes, yes

213
00:06:23,860 --> 00:06:24,830
Oh yeah

214
00:06:25,470 --> 00:06:27,090
There's also Sakura Shrimp

215
00:06:26,770 --> 00:06:28,030
Sakura Shrimp?

216
00:06:28,030 --> 00:06:29,070
Number 61?

217
00:06:28,770 --> 00:06:29,760
That's also red

218
00:06:29,500 --> 00:06:31,010
So the colour first right?

219
00:06:31,010 --> 00:06:33,090
Yeah yeah the colour is important

220
00:06:32,260 --> 00:06:33,550
How about the smell?

221
00:06:33,090 --> 00:06:34,830
Not really ...

222
00:06:34,860 --> 00:06:37,830
The redness could also be from plums

223
00:06:37,830 --> 00:06:38,880
Plums ...

224
00:06:38,500 --> 00:06:40,770
We won't know until we try them

225
00:06:39,320 --> 00:06:40,770
Yes taste them

226
00:06:40,770 --> 00:06:42,000
The hell is this? ...

227
00:06:42,000 --> 00:06:42,990
This is-

228
00:06:43,740 --> 00:06:44,300
Hmm

229
00:06:44,300 --> 00:06:45,360
Hold on

230
00:06:45,680 --> 00:06:47,340
I got this one

231
00:06:47,900 --> 00:06:48,940
Tanaka-san you also-

232
00:06:48,940 --> 00:06:50,700
Mostly- I think I got it

233
00:06:50,700 --> 00:06:52,140
Hold on this is a hard one

234
00:06:52,140 --> 00:06:53,180
I got it

235
00:06:52,590 --> 00:06:53,540
I got it

236
00:06:53,540 --> 00:06:54,500
Housei-san?

237
00:06:54,500 --> 00:06:56,030
I got it-

238
00:06:56,940 --> 00:06:58,780
Surely you are too surprised

239
00:06:58,780 --> 00:07:00,770
Was it really that scary?

240
00:07:00,930 --> 00:07:03,440
What did you think it was?

241
00:07:03,600 --> 00:07:05,890
As soon as I said "I got it",

242
00:07:05,890 --> 00:07:08,020
It was like "You're wrong!"

243
00:07:08,030 --> 00:07:11,010
I thought the Calbee mascot was angry or something...

244
00:07:09,890 --> 00:07:12,530
How hated are you?

245
00:07:12,530 --> 00:07:14,740
Let's go, let's say our guesses

246
00:07:14,220 --> 00:07:16,020
Wait, wait, hold on

247
00:07:16,020 --> 00:07:18,290
I think it's definitely that one

248
00:07:17,380 --> 00:07:19,090
I also think it's that one

249
00:07:18,510 --> 00:07:19,320
Me too

250
00:07:19,320 --> 00:07:20,380
I'm confident

251
00:07:19,950 --> 00:07:20,700
I see

252
00:07:20,380 --> 00:07:21,820
I'm confident

253
00:07:21,070 --> 00:07:23,440
Hamada-san is still...

254
00:07:23,580 --> 00:07:25,950
Hamada-san, say something

255
00:07:27,180 --> 00:07:29,940
There's a spiciness at the end

256
00:07:30,230 --> 00:07:32,610
So it's not one of those flavours

257
00:07:32,610 --> 00:07:33,980
It's not?

258
00:07:32,880 --> 00:07:34,180
That is not possible

259
00:07:34,180 --> 00:07:37,140
Then, then even though I'm not one to say,

260
00:07:37,140 --> 00:07:41,250
Isn't it 64? Osaka Pickled Ginger?

261
00:07:38,110 --> 00:07:43,780
Exactly, it's like that's the only possible choice

262
00:07:42,670 --> 00:07:44,270
Same for you Matsumoto-san?

263
00:07:43,920 --> 00:07:47,380
I thought that at first too, but the aftertaste,

264
00:07:47,380 --> 00:07:51,170
It's reminiscent of shrimp

265
00:07:50,780 --> 00:07:52,050
Yes exactly!

266
00:07:53,010 --> 00:07:55,830
So if I had to choose, number 61

267
00:07:55,830 --> 00:07:58,830
It's possibly Sakura Shrimp

268
00:07:56,610 --> 00:07:57,810
I see

269
00:07:57,810 --> 00:07:59,920
Then I say number 61 too

270
00:07:59,920 --> 00:08:00,930
Endo-san?

271
00:08:00,380 --> 00:08:01,790
Number 64 for me

272
00:08:01,790 --> 00:08:02,930
No doubt

273
00:08:02,780 --> 00:08:05,090
You didn't change it to 64 after everyone else?

274
00:08:03,890 --> 00:08:06,620
No, no I thought this from the beginning

275
00:08:07,730 --> 00:08:08,930
Is that the truth?

276
00:08:09,810 --> 00:08:12,420
Cause you genuinely thought it was Soy & Mayo

277
00:08:14,460 --> 00:08:17,730
But, three of us said it was 64

278
00:08:17,420 --> 00:08:18,590
That's true

279
00:08:17,420 --> 00:08:18,590
That's true

280
00:08:18,590 --> 00:08:22,080
With that said, everyone, your answer please

281
00:08:22,080 --> 00:08:24,220
The one we ate,

282
00:08:24,220 --> 00:08:27,890
was Osaka Pickled Ginger flavour!

283
00:08:30,020 --> 00:08:31,740
Unfortunately, incorrect!

284
00:08:31,460 --> 00:08:32,540
I've no idea...

285
00:08:32,210 --> 00:08:33,420
Incorrect!

286
00:08:32,930 --> 00:08:34,720
Seriously? It's totally that...

287
00:08:33,810 --> 00:08:34,940
Incorrect

288
00:08:36,300 --> 00:08:38,530
If you say "That one", it's that one

289
00:08:37,790 --> 00:08:38,750
61?!

290
00:08:41,700 --> 00:08:44,180
It was Shimane's Akaten flavour!

291
00:08:45,310 --> 00:08:47,220
Don't know what that is!

292
00:08:47,600 --> 00:08:50,940
I've never eaten Akaten before!

293
00:08:50,160 --> 00:08:51,280
Exactly!

294
00:08:51,080 --> 00:08:54,860
We told you, it's a spicy fish paste

295
00:08:54,860 --> 00:08:55,790
You did

296
00:08:55,790 --> 00:08:57,490
That was the spiciness?

297
00:08:57,490 --> 00:09:00,420
That was the spiciness we told you about

298
00:09:00,690 --> 00:09:03,420
Fujiwara gave you a hint at the start

299
00:09:03,420 --> 00:09:05,660
When Matsumoto-san said "What is Akaten?!"

300
00:09:05,660 --> 00:09:08,860
I explained what Akaten is to you...

301
00:09:08,860 --> 00:09:11,950
I don't listen to anything you say

302
00:09:11,060 --> 00:09:11,950
I'm shocked

303
00:09:12,180 --> 00:09:13,060
I'm shocked

304
00:09:14,800 --> 00:09:17,600
Let's continue, next up is this

305
00:09:17,600 --> 00:09:18,620
YES!

306
00:09:18,620 --> 00:09:20,130
We can narrow this down

307
00:09:19,900 --> 00:09:21,020
The appearance right?

308
00:09:21,020 --> 00:09:22,940
It's the ruffled type

309
00:09:23,300 --> 00:09:24,380
One of those two

310
00:09:23,450 --> 00:09:27,080
Ruffled - Chicken Consome

311
00:09:23,450 --> 00:09:27,080
Ruffled- Salted

312
00:09:24,380 --> 00:09:25,340
Either one

313
00:09:24,380 --> 00:09:25,340
Oh yeah

314
00:09:25,340 --> 00:09:26,590
Either one right?

315
00:09:25,710 --> 00:09:27,080
This is a freebie right?

316
00:09:27,080 --> 00:09:29,010
Ah this is a freebie question

317
00:09:29,230 --> 00:09:30,720
Yeah at this point they should

318
00:09:30,720 --> 00:09:33,120
It's gonna suck if we get this wrong

319
00:09:32,850 --> 00:09:33,920
Let's try 'em

320
00:09:33,390 --> 00:09:34,720
Only two-

321
00:09:36,270 --> 00:09:37,180
Hmm?

322
00:09:42,850 --> 00:09:45,260
The ruffled makes it taste different

323
00:09:44,140 --> 00:09:45,680
I'm getting hints of butter

324
00:09:45,870 --> 00:09:46,740
Yeah

325
00:09:46,740 --> 00:09:49,040
This isn't consome right?

326
00:09:49,220 --> 00:09:50,060
I got it

327
00:09:50,610 --> 00:09:52,770
I was deceived by the ruffles

328
00:09:54,050 --> 00:09:56,080
The ruffles are irrelevant

329
00:09:55,570 --> 00:09:56,690
Irrelevant?

330
00:09:56,270 --> 00:09:57,120
Yeah

331
00:09:57,120 --> 00:09:58,100
But it's,

332
00:09:58,100 --> 00:09:59,920
It's honestly, spicy

333
00:09:59,920 --> 00:10:00,960
Spicy?

334
00:10:00,620 --> 00:10:01,220
It's spicy

335
00:10:01,220 --> 00:10:02,190
Spicy??

336
00:10:02,030 --> 00:10:02,830
It's a bit

337
00:10:02,830 --> 00:10:03,920
a bit tangy

338
00:10:02,830 --> 00:10:03,920
a bit tangy

339
00:10:03,700 --> 00:10:05,760
OK I got it, can I say it?

340
00:10:04,670 --> 00:10:05,360
Really?

341
00:10:05,940 --> 00:10:09,940
#39, Luxury Potato - Potato Butter

342
00:10:09,060 --> 00:10:10,260
Yes, yes, yes

343
00:10:09,940 --> 00:10:11,070
Right?

344
00:10:11,280 --> 00:10:13,740
There's definitely a butter taste

345
00:10:13,740 --> 00:10:15,410
It's definitely butter

346
00:10:14,750 --> 00:10:16,220
Tanaka-san?

347
00:10:15,900 --> 00:10:16,800
39 for me too

348
00:10:16,800 --> 00:10:17,470
The same?

349
00:10:17,470 --> 00:10:18,190
39

350
00:10:18,820 --> 00:10:20,130
What about #23?

351
00:10:19,760 --> 00:10:20,800
23?

352
00:10:20,940 --> 00:10:21,950
Could be that one

353
00:10:21,950 --> 00:10:24,440
Rich Potato - Butter & Soy Sauce

354
00:10:23,300 --> 00:10:24,440
Yeah could be

355
00:10:24,740 --> 00:10:26,640
There's a feeling of "rich"ness

356
00:10:26,930 --> 00:10:29,280
This spiciness is not in those

357
00:10:29,420 --> 00:10:30,300
It's spicy?

358
00:10:30,300 --> 00:10:31,020
It is

359
00:10:31,030 --> 00:10:31,710
The spiciness-

360
00:10:31,710 --> 00:10:33,580
There isn't any

361
00:10:33,580 --> 00:10:35,330
You're told us it's spicy right?

362
00:10:35,330 --> 00:10:37,790
Yeah, it's definitely spicy

363
00:10:37,790 --> 00:10:39,500
You guys aren't getting it

364
00:10:39,500 --> 00:10:41,250
It's not spicy, it's a rich flavour

365
00:10:41,250 --> 00:10:43,090
Yes it's rich, one of those

366
00:10:43,090 --> 00:10:45,660
Rich Butter, it's 23!

367
00:10:45,070 --> 00:10:47,040
It's either 39 or 23

368
00:10:46,740 --> 00:10:47,380
Right?

369
00:10:47,040 --> 00:10:49,010
It's definitely butter

370
00:10:48,000 --> 00:10:50,460
By the way, what is your guess Housei-san?

371
00:10:50,930 --> 00:10:52,940
Can I say it seriously?

372
00:10:53,260 --> 00:10:56,130
The one I really got was 13

373
00:10:55,040 --> 00:10:59,840
Mentaiko Butter

374
00:10:57,380 --> 00:10:59,840
There's no hints of mentaiko!

375
00:10:59,840 --> 00:11:02,880
The hints of mentaiko,

376
00:11:02,880 --> 00:11:04,510
Look carefully please,

377
00:11:04,510 --> 00:11:06,690
There's bits of mentaiko

378
00:11:06,690 --> 00:11:08,180
The red bits right

379
00:11:07,420 --> 00:11:08,580
The red bits

380
00:11:08,180 --> 00:11:09,140
This is mentaiko?

381
00:11:09,140 --> 00:11:10,370
This is mentaiko

382
00:11:10,620 --> 00:11:11,490
Oh!

383
00:11:11,490 --> 00:11:12,240
Right?

384
00:11:12,620 --> 00:11:14,460
What if it is!

385
00:11:13,940 --> 00:11:14,850
Right?

386
00:11:15,810 --> 00:11:17,460
It could be!

387
00:11:16,580 --> 00:11:17,480
Right?!

388
00:11:17,480 --> 00:11:20,670
Once you tell me, it tastes like it

389
00:11:20,980 --> 00:11:22,320
This is a good hint

390
00:11:22,320 --> 00:11:26,470
It's a bit frustrating, but let's listen to Yamasaki

391
00:11:26,190 --> 00:11:27,340
It could be that one

392
00:11:27,730 --> 00:11:28,940
Let's get this correct

393
00:11:28,940 --> 00:11:30,740
Yes, let's get this right

394
00:11:30,740 --> 00:11:32,780
Everyone, your answer please!

395
00:11:32,780 --> 00:11:37,920
The one we ate, was, Mentaiko Butter Flavour

396
00:11:39,870 --> 00:11:41,720
Fantastic!

397
00:11:42,770 --> 00:11:45,060
Fantastic, well done!

398
00:11:45,820 --> 00:11:48,060
Housei-san is amazing!

399
00:11:48,060 --> 00:11:49,660
He really told us!

400
00:11:49,660 --> 00:11:51,200
Well done!

401
00:11:56,300 --> 00:12:01,020
You were the only one banging on about the spiciness

402
00:12:00,340 --> 00:12:07,510
Hakata's special "Spicy Mentaiko", crisp spiciness, and a rich butter flavour

403
00:12:07,510 --> 00:12:10,020
You skillfully distinguished the taste

404
00:12:08,900 --> 00:12:10,020
Thank you

405
00:12:10,020 --> 00:12:11,680
That was fantastic

406
00:12:12,660 --> 00:12:13,540
That felt good

407
00:12:13,540 --> 00:12:15,700
I'm very happy

408
00:12:15,700 --> 00:12:17,650
Like I carried everyone

409
00:12:18,830 --> 00:12:21,070
The ruffles decieved us huh?

410
00:12:21,070 --> 00:12:23,840
We have to change the way we think

411
00:12:25,020 --> 00:12:28,580
Moving on, the next chips are these

412
00:12:33,730 --> 00:12:35,570
I think I've eaten these before

413
00:12:34,870 --> 00:12:36,110
Oh, really?

414
00:12:38,500 --> 00:12:40,020
I've eaten these before

415
00:12:39,360 --> 00:12:40,770
Is it that flavour?

416
00:12:40,420 --> 00:12:42,180
I think it's that one

417
00:12:41,650 --> 00:12:42,180
Right?

418
00:12:42,180 --> 00:12:44,050
That was quick

419
00:12:44,050 --> 00:12:45,150
I think it's that-

420
00:12:45,150 --> 00:12:47,330
It's either of those

421
00:12:47,920 --> 00:12:49,980
It's either one yeah

422
00:12:48,940 --> 00:12:49,550
Right?

423
00:12:49,550 --> 00:12:50,450
It's rich

424
00:12:50,450 --> 00:12:51,540
It's rich?

425
00:12:51,540 --> 00:12:53,170
It's rich? Huh?

426
00:12:53,410 --> 00:12:56,590
It could be one of those plain ones

427
00:12:54,060 --> 00:12:56,610
Consome Double Punch

428
00:12:55,490 --> 00:12:57,070
Yeah exactly

429
00:12:57,900 --> 00:13:00,080
I guess I'm lame after all...

430
00:13:00,110 --> 00:13:02,020
You're cool!

431
00:13:02,020 --> 00:13:04,060
You're cool!

432
00:13:04,060 --> 00:13:05,630
What the hell?

433
00:13:06,400 --> 00:13:29,460
This part is repeated

434
00:13:31,260 --> 00:13:34,610
You! What the hell?

435
00:13:34,960 --> 00:13:37,940
Endo and I think it's either one. 2 or-

436
00:13:37,600 --> 00:13:40,670
Consome Soup                     Consome Double Punch

437
00:13:37,940 --> 00:13:39,550
2 or 7

438
00:13:39,280 --> 00:13:40,670
2 or 7?

439
00:13:39,760 --> 00:13:40,690
or 7

440
00:13:40,690 --> 00:13:42,670
Absolutely not

441
00:13:41,500 --> 00:13:42,960
There's no way

442
00:13:42,670 --> 00:13:45,340
Consome punch isn't like this

443
00:13:45,340 --> 00:13:47,940
But the amateurs would think so

444
00:13:47,940 --> 00:13:49,650
They'll think it's consome punch

445
00:13:49,650 --> 00:13:51,090
Amateurs

446
00:13:51,100 --> 00:13:52,880
You're a professional?

447
00:13:52,880 --> 00:13:56,880
I think Housei-san is taking a very different approach

448
00:13:56,880 --> 00:13:58,530
Eh seriously?

449
00:13:58,530 --> 00:14:03,490
I really understand that amateurs would think this is consome

450
00:14:02,850 --> 00:14:04,300
Understand their feelings?

451
00:14:03,490 --> 00:14:04,300
Yes

452
00:14:04,300 --> 00:14:06,110
But amateurs don't understand

453
00:14:06,110 --> 00:14:09,390
The smell is totally different, completely different

454
00:14:09,150 --> 00:14:10,210
From consome?

455
00:14:10,210 --> 00:14:12,450
Consome is more brown

456
00:14:12,450 --> 00:14:13,440
Oh really?

457
00:14:12,940 --> 00:14:13,650
Yes

458
00:14:13,650 --> 00:14:15,070
More brown

459
00:14:15,070 --> 00:14:16,980
It's more delicate

460
00:14:16,980 --> 00:14:18,780
Yeah

461
00:14:17,620 --> 00:14:18,780
Yes exactly

462
00:14:20,320 --> 00:14:22,500
I don't have a friggin clue

463
00:14:22,300 --> 00:14:23,790
Not a friggin clue?

464
00:14:24,660 --> 00:14:25,920
That is shocking

465
00:14:24,860 --> 00:14:26,260
Not a friggin clue?

466
00:14:26,260 --> 00:14:29,260
It's somewhere between 21 and 56

467
00:14:30,590 --> 00:14:32,110
Not a friggin clue

468
00:14:32,110 --> 00:14:33,140
Is it like-

469
00:14:33,140 --> 00:14:34,580
No FRIGGIN idea!

470
00:14:34,580 --> 00:14:36,340
Not even if it's consome LOL

471
00:14:35,310 --> 00:14:36,690
So loud

472
00:14:38,290 --> 00:14:38,930
You ate it too

473
00:14:38,660 --> 00:14:41,260
Yama-chan which is it?!

474
00:14:40,640 --> 00:14:42,880
There's two of them

475
00:14:42,620 --> 00:14:43,760
Which ones?

476
00:14:43,220 --> 00:14:45,950
So the taste right, for example

477
00:14:45,950 --> 00:14:48,300
Like Kyushu Soy Sauce

478
00:14:48,300 --> 00:14:50,500
Say the friggin number!

479
00:14:50,770 --> 00:14:52,340
He got so mad

480
00:14:52,130 --> 00:14:53,730
He got really angry

481
00:14:53,300 --> 00:14:54,610
So hostile

482
00:14:54,610 --> 00:14:56,770
If you don't say the number I can't find it

483
00:14:57,300 --> 00:14:59,060
He's unleashing his anger again

484
00:14:59,060 --> 00:15:02,130
I was trying to build up to the answer...

485
00:15:02,130 --> 00:15:03,410
You need to say the number

486
00:15:03,410 --> 00:15:06,400
I was building up my justification

487
00:15:05,360 --> 00:15:06,750
Say the number

488
00:15:06,400 --> 00:15:08,420
Like 34 for example

489
00:15:08,420 --> 00:15:11,090
It feels like that sort of taste

490
00:15:08,420 --> 00:15:11,390
Kettle Cooked - Kansai Dashi Soy Sauce

491
00:15:09,940 --> 00:15:12,960
But it's not kettle cooked right?

492
00:15:12,960 --> 00:15:16,130
Yeah it's not kettle cooked, so #4 or #8

493
00:15:14,620 --> 00:15:16,130
Happiness Butter

494
00:15:16,130 --> 00:15:17,600
Hokkaido Butter

495
00:15:16,130 --> 00:15:17,600
So 4 or 8

496
00:15:17,600 --> 00:15:19,470
Is there butter taste?

497
00:15:19,470 --> 00:15:22,080
This is butter, this is butter taste

498
00:15:21,440 --> 00:15:23,810
But the last one was butter,

499
00:15:23,810 --> 00:15:25,950
Would we get butter twice in a row?

500
00:15:27,570 --> 00:15:29,490
I have no idea ...

501
00:15:29,490 --> 00:15:31,150
Genuinely no idea

502
00:15:31,150 --> 00:15:34,150
So could all of you-

503
00:15:32,720 --> 00:15:34,690
This is the hardest one so far

504
00:15:33,980 --> 00:15:35,220
Honestly yeah

505
00:15:34,690 --> 00:15:37,440
Could you all say an answer together?

506
00:15:37,060 --> 00:15:40,050
He got it before, so let's rely on Fonto-chan

507
00:15:37,970 --> 00:15:40,050
Counting on you Yama-chan!

508
00:15:40,420 --> 00:15:41,790
Really?

509
00:15:41,790 --> 00:15:42,800
#4!

510
00:15:41,790 --> 00:15:42,800
Happiness Butter

511
00:15:42,800 --> 00:15:44,270
Understood

512
00:15:44,280 --> 00:15:46,590
The answer please!

513
00:15:46,590 --> 00:15:51,070
The one we ate, was, Happiness Butter Flavour!

514
00:15:52,690 --> 00:15:54,270
Unfortunately incorrect!

515
00:15:53,260 --> 00:15:55,460
There's no helping it, this was impossible

516
00:15:56,710 --> 00:15:58,850
Why say it like that?

517
00:15:58,850 --> 00:15:59,760
Impossible?

518
00:15:59,250 --> 00:16:00,420
What the hell?

519
00:15:59,760 --> 00:16:03,410
I was not convinced that it was butter

520
00:16:03,410 --> 00:16:07,140
It's unbelievable you all did not get this

521
00:16:08,150 --> 00:16:12,590
#50 - Yamagata's Simmered Curry Udon!

522
00:16:13,220 --> 00:16:14,850
Seriously?

523
00:16:15,250 --> 00:16:16,430
It's curry

524
00:16:16,020 --> 00:16:17,100
Curry?!

525
00:16:17,100 --> 00:16:18,640
It was a total miss!

526
00:16:18,640 --> 00:16:20,800
There's no way!

527
00:16:20,110 --> 00:16:22,940
There's no way, no way

528
00:16:20,800 --> 00:16:22,450
Can't be curry

529
00:16:22,940 --> 00:16:24,980
It's curry flavour, right?

530
00:16:25,180 --> 00:16:26,400
Curry?!

531
00:16:26,620 --> 00:16:28,430
It's curry!

532
00:16:29,910 --> 00:16:31,420
Oh yeah,

533
00:16:30,220 --> 00:16:31,420
Really?

534
00:16:31,420 --> 00:16:33,230
It's curry!

535
00:16:31,420 --> 00:16:33,230
It's curry!

536
00:16:32,000 --> 00:16:34,080
After you hear it's curry?

537
00:16:33,540 --> 00:16:35,300
After you tell me...

538
00:16:34,080 --> 00:16:35,300
It's curry!

539
00:16:36,700 --> 00:16:37,950
it's curry ...

540
00:16:38,900 --> 00:16:40,990
After you tell me and I eat it...

541
00:16:40,990 --> 00:16:44,020
After you tell me, it becomes curry!

542
00:16:45,650 --> 00:16:48,670
So now you can taste the curry flavour

543
00:16:47,440 --> 00:16:48,670
Certainly

544
00:16:48,670 --> 00:16:51,460
It's a mild taste

545
00:16:52,940 --> 00:16:55,780
Next up are these chips

546
00:16:55,600 --> 00:16:57,180
Oh these are ...

547
00:16:58,060 --> 00:16:59,460
Hold on...

548
00:16:59,460 --> 00:17:02,770
You just gotta smell it before anyone else huh?

549
00:17:02,770 --> 00:17:04,340
He smells them immediately

550
00:17:04,340 --> 00:17:08,580
Like "I am the one who smells"

551
00:17:07,280 --> 00:17:08,960
You can smell it too!

552
00:17:08,960 --> 00:17:11,490
Just smelling the shit out of them

553
00:17:11,490 --> 00:17:14,490
Ah but ... the smell

554
00:17:12,780 --> 00:17:14,490
The appearance is...

555
00:17:14,690 --> 00:17:17,090
I see I see, I understand

556
00:17:17,090 --> 00:17:19,330
You understand?

557
00:17:20,670 --> 00:17:23,180
What is this smell?

558
00:17:21,330 --> 00:17:23,210
What is this?

559
00:17:23,680 --> 00:17:25,540
They're tasty tho

560
00:17:25,540 --> 00:17:27,200
Tasty?

561
00:17:26,430 --> 00:17:27,550
Tasty

562
00:17:27,840 --> 00:17:30,180
We should be able to get this one

563
00:17:30,180 --> 00:17:33,020
There's a distinct flavour

564
00:17:34,220 --> 00:17:37,060
There's something there

565
00:17:36,210 --> 00:17:37,090
Yeah

566
00:17:37,090 --> 00:17:39,470
It's a distinct taste?

567
00:17:37,790 --> 00:17:39,470
Yeah yeah

568
00:17:39,180 --> 00:17:41,260
A kombu taste maybe?

569
00:17:41,470 --> 00:17:43,090
Hmm yeah

570
00:17:43,310 --> 00:17:44,750
Say what you think it is

571
00:17:44,760 --> 00:17:45,820
Ready, steady,

572
00:17:45,820 --> 00:17:48,820
Chicken Salt

573
00:17:45,820 --> 00:17:48,820
Iwate Hitsumi Soup

574
00:17:45,820 --> 00:17:48,820
Kansai Dashi Soy Sauce

575
00:17:45,820 --> 00:17:48,820
Sweet & Salty

576
00:17:45,820 --> 00:17:48,820
White Soy Sauce

577
00:17:48,820 --> 00:17:50,740
It's all over the place. Housei-san?

578
00:17:50,290 --> 00:17:51,360
#40

579
00:17:51,040 --> 00:17:52,380
Sweet & Salty

580
00:17:52,380 --> 00:17:54,190
Springtime potato     - Matsumoto-san?

581
00:17:54,190 --> 00:17:55,890
11, it's 11

582
00:17:55,260 --> 00:17:56,480
Kansai Dashi Soy Sauce?

583
00:17:56,110 --> 00:17:58,660
Like a weak dashi taste

584
00:17:57,460 --> 00:17:58,660
Oh yeah I get that

585
00:17:58,660 --> 00:18:01,930
"This tastes like a weak dashi"

586
00:18:00,300 --> 00:18:01,930
Hamada-san?

587
00:18:00,540 --> 00:18:01,950
I said #10

588
00:18:01,950 --> 00:18:03,280
White Soy Sauce

589
00:18:03,280 --> 00:18:05,870
Ah I see, yeah exactly

590
00:18:05,620 --> 00:18:06,590
Endo-san?

591
00:18:06,000 --> 00:18:08,400
I said #47,

592
00:18:08,400 --> 00:18:10,180
Hitsumi Soup

593
00:18:10,180 --> 00:18:13,280
I don't know what that it is, but it might as well be this

594
00:18:13,280 --> 00:18:17,360
I said #43, Chicken Salt

595
00:18:15,440 --> 00:18:17,360
I said #43, Chicken Salt

596
00:18:17,360 --> 00:18:19,140
Chicken Salt?

597
00:18:18,610 --> 00:18:21,360
Yeah like a salty chicken umami flavour

598
00:18:21,600 --> 00:18:22,980
Chicken?

599
00:18:22,980 --> 00:18:24,940
It's chicken yeah

600
00:18:24,160 --> 00:18:25,780
It became chicken for you?

601
00:18:26,140 --> 00:18:28,860
After you hear that it tastes like it right?

602
00:18:28,080 --> 00:18:29,260
This could be good

603
00:18:28,530 --> 00:18:30,400
The smell is chicken!

604
00:18:29,570 --> 00:18:31,040
This could be good

605
00:18:30,400 --> 00:18:31,710
Really?

606
00:18:31,040 --> 00:18:32,210
Yeah

607
00:18:32,430 --> 00:18:35,300
The chicken-ness is pouring down on me

608
00:18:38,030 --> 00:18:39,220
Can we get this?

609
00:18:39,220 --> 00:18:40,820
We can, we can

610
00:18:40,180 --> 00:18:41,010
We did it?

611
00:18:41,010 --> 00:18:42,400
We did it yeah

612
00:18:42,400 --> 00:18:45,400
Everyone, the answer please!

613
00:18:45,400 --> 00:18:49,280
The one we ate, was, Chicken Salt flavour!

614
00:18:49,980 --> 00:18:52,340
Unfortunately incorrect!

615
00:18:51,620 --> 00:18:53,950
Totally missed the mark!

616
00:18:53,950 --> 00:18:58,720
The one you all ate was #49, Iburi-Gakko (Smoked Pickled Daikon)

617
00:18:57,250 --> 00:18:58,740
Like I said-

618
00:18:58,740 --> 00:19:02,320
Like you said, now that you know it's Iburi-Gakko,

619
00:19:02,320 --> 00:19:05,840
Please try them again

620
00:19:04,990 --> 00:19:07,010
I had no idea

621
00:19:06,610 --> 00:19:08,180
I thought it was octopus

622
00:19:08,180 --> 00:19:12,000
They should taste like pickled vegetables

623
00:19:10,910 --> 00:19:12,460
Oh yeah!

624
00:19:12,000 --> 00:19:14,140
It's ibburi-gakko!

625
00:19:13,180 --> 00:19:15,440
Once you tell me yeah

626
00:19:14,140 --> 00:19:15,860
After we tell you yeah

627
00:19:15,890 --> 00:19:17,150
They really do

628
00:19:16,780 --> 00:19:17,920
A smoky taste?

629
00:19:17,920 --> 00:19:20,020
It's definitely ibburi-gakko

630
00:19:19,410 --> 00:19:21,680
It literally can't be anything else

631
00:19:21,680 --> 00:19:22,880
Honestly yeah

632
00:19:24,340 --> 00:19:27,260
Our sense of taste is so weird!

633
00:19:26,270 --> 00:19:28,020
Yeah exactly

634
00:19:27,700 --> 00:19:29,120
It's ibburi-gakko right?

635
00:19:28,660 --> 00:19:31,250
Can you say the names first from now on?

636
00:19:32,520 --> 00:19:34,900
Next up are these chips

637
00:19:36,100 --> 00:19:37,740
That's nori!

638
00:19:37,340 --> 00:19:38,930
What is this...

639
00:19:38,930 --> 00:19:43,040
There would be more green flecks, and there's red stuff here too

640
00:19:43,040 --> 00:19:45,940
I see maybe the nori is irrelevant

641
00:19:48,750 --> 00:19:50,190
It's a distinct flavour

642
00:19:50,190 --> 00:19:51,970
Yeah, the hell is this?

643
00:19:51,970 --> 00:19:53,250
The hell is this...

644
00:19:53,250 --> 00:19:55,180
I kinda like this one

645
00:19:57,920 --> 00:19:59,380
I got it

646
00:19:58,900 --> 00:20:00,350
I've no idea...

647
00:20:00,350 --> 00:20:01,720
I got this

648
00:20:01,950 --> 00:20:03,250
Can I say it?

649
00:20:03,490 --> 00:20:04,980
It's #37

650
00:20:04,320 --> 00:20:06,260
Cheese & Herbs?

651
00:20:06,590 --> 00:20:08,400
*Chews in Japanese*

652
00:20:08,400 --> 00:20:09,220
I see

653
00:20:10,580 --> 00:20:12,580
Nobody is saying anything

654
00:20:12,880 --> 00:20:14,270
We don't really know

655
00:20:13,860 --> 00:20:16,480
The staff are like;

656
00:20:17,230 --> 00:20:19,500
You'll give away the answer reacting like that!

657
00:20:19,500 --> 00:20:21,980
Yeah but the herbs,

658
00:20:21,980 --> 00:20:24,400
Isn't this a herb taste?

659
00:20:23,200 --> 00:20:25,840
Hamada-san is really smelling these chips

660
00:20:24,900 --> 00:20:27,010
He's really smelling them

661
00:20:26,140 --> 00:20:28,290
I have no idea, what is this?

662
00:20:28,910 --> 00:20:34,820
Potato Chips - Taste Guess

663
00:20:31,380 --> 00:20:33,630
TN: His mouth is full of chips so not sure about this line

664
00:20:31,380 --> 00:20:33,630
There's a mayo taste too

665
00:20:34,820 --> 00:20:36,780
It's a mysterious taste huh?

666
00:20:36,780 --> 00:20:39,540
It's refreshing, very refreshing

667
00:20:39,540 --> 00:20:42,270
It's kind of a salad taste

668
00:20:42,580 --> 00:20:44,190
Yeah it tastes like salad

669
00:20:44,820 --> 00:20:45,950
Endo-san?

670
00:20:45,950 --> 00:20:50,290
Because I taste salad,

671
00:20:49,730 --> 00:20:58,070
French Salad

672
00:20:50,290 --> 00:20:52,020
I say #5

673
00:20:52,020 --> 00:20:55,020
I think I've eaten french salad before,

674
00:20:56,690 --> 00:20:58,690
Is there a sourness?

675
00:20:58,220 --> 00:20:59,600
Yes

676
00:20:58,500 --> 00:20:59,820
There is

677
00:21:00,290 --> 00:21:03,010
What smell is this?...

678
00:21:01,700 --> 00:21:04,250
There's a lot more choices this time

679
00:21:04,250 --> 00:21:08,290
Like afterwards "Ah it was that flavour"

680
00:21:08,290 --> 00:21:09,720
Like the curry?

681
00:21:08,700 --> 00:21:09,740
Yeah

682
00:21:09,740 --> 00:21:11,380
I couldn't taste the curry

683
00:21:10,850 --> 00:21:12,480
Housei-san?

684
00:21:12,100 --> 00:21:15,520
I think, cause it's a mysterious taste,

685
00:21:15,520 --> 00:21:18,000
For example #46,

686
00:21:16,590 --> 00:21:20,060
Aomori's Shellfish Miso

687
00:21:20,480 --> 00:21:24,420
Or could be 16 too

688
00:21:20,480 --> 00:21:24,700
Pizza Potato

689
00:21:23,200 --> 00:21:27,410
Wait hold on everyone, what is this green stuff?

690
00:21:27,410 --> 00:21:29,740
What a slump

691
00:21:29,740 --> 00:21:31,890
What a big slump

692
00:21:34,270 --> 00:21:37,600
Can you all come to a conclusion?

693
00:21:37,090 --> 00:21:38,380
Hold on, hold on

694
00:21:37,920 --> 00:21:41,790
It could be something simple like French Salad right?

695
00:21:40,220 --> 00:21:42,850
That's what I thought at first

696
00:21:43,870 --> 00:21:46,260
Can I pass this one?

697
00:21:46,260 --> 00:21:48,220
No, you can't

698
00:21:47,920 --> 00:21:49,140
I can't

699
00:21:48,220 --> 00:21:49,620
You can't pass

700
00:21:49,620 --> 00:21:50,370
Really?

701
00:21:50,370 --> 00:21:52,270
There's no pass

702
00:21:51,390 --> 00:21:52,960
Should we go with #5?

703
00:21:52,960 --> 00:21:54,460
French Salad?

704
00:21:54,460 --> 00:21:56,110
Is it really not this one?

705
00:21:56,110 --> 00:21:57,060
French Salad?

706
00:21:57,060 --> 00:21:58,740
There's no way

707
00:21:57,940 --> 00:21:59,140
Really?

708
00:21:59,280 --> 00:22:00,750
There's no way

709
00:22:00,750 --> 00:22:04,690
It's not between 1 & 5

710
00:22:01,650 --> 00:22:02,980
Seriously?

711
00:22:03,810 --> 00:22:06,400
I see, you've probably eaten those before?

712
00:22:06,620 --> 00:22:07,840
Really?

713
00:22:08,020 --> 00:22:10,530
Can we go for Cheese & Herbs?

714
00:22:09,520 --> 00:22:10,560
37

715
00:22:10,560 --> 00:22:12,080
Let's go

716
00:22:11,330 --> 00:22:12,290
I see

717
00:22:12,290 --> 00:22:14,140
Cheese & Herb right?

718
00:22:14,140 --> 00:22:16,190
It will feel great if we get this

719
00:22:15,500 --> 00:22:17,020
Yes that would be great

720
00:22:16,750 --> 00:22:19,300
With that said, the answer please!

721
00:22:19,300 --> 00:22:23,620
The one we ate, was, Cheese & Herb flavour!

722
00:22:25,300 --> 00:22:28,160
Unfortunately, not right!

723
00:22:26,990 --> 00:22:28,780
Wrong again?

724
00:22:28,160 --> 00:22:30,370
This is difficult

725
00:22:29,530 --> 00:22:32,880
But, you did guess this correctly before

726
00:22:32,290 --> 00:22:33,470
Really?!

727
00:22:33,470 --> 00:22:35,790
You were so close!

728
00:22:35,790 --> 00:22:39,010
It was French Salad!

729
00:22:39,310 --> 00:22:40,770
You said it wasn't

730
00:22:40,770 --> 00:22:42,510
You said there's no way!

731
00:22:41,970 --> 00:22:43,760
You're a liability!

732
00:22:44,240 --> 00:22:46,370
Blocking our path!

733
00:22:44,700 --> 00:22:47,070
You said there's no way!

734
00:22:46,820 --> 00:22:48,300
You said it with your chest!

735
00:22:47,870 --> 00:22:49,730
Housei-san, Batsu Game!

736
00:22:49,300 --> 00:22:51,540
WHY THE HELL?!

737
00:22:51,220 --> 00:22:52,740
HOLD ON!

738
00:22:58,560 --> 00:23:07,650
This part is repeated

739
00:23:07,650 --> 00:23:10,100
I got it correct before!

740
00:23:09,390 --> 00:23:10,690
That is scary!

741
00:23:10,100 --> 00:23:11,010
What should I do?

742
00:23:11,010 --> 00:23:12,930
Just stand there

743
00:23:12,960 --> 00:23:14,080
Where will he hit?

744
00:23:13,410 --> 00:23:16,050
YOU TASTE GUESS POTATO THINGS!

745
00:23:16,300 --> 00:23:16,990
What?

746
00:23:16,990 --> 00:23:19,420
BLOOJI BAJTARD!

747
00:23:26,120 --> 00:23:27,860
The hell was he saying?

748
00:23:27,140 --> 00:23:29,170
What language was that?

749
00:23:29,170 --> 00:23:31,040
What kind of insult?

750
00:23:29,920 --> 00:23:31,790
"BLOOJI BAJTARD"

751
00:23:31,310 --> 00:23:32,500
I see, "Bloody Bastard"

752
00:23:32,860 --> 00:23:34,610
We could have got this one

753
00:23:34,610 --> 00:23:35,950
We guessed this one

754
00:23:35,950 --> 00:23:39,400
Endo-san said it was French Salad

755
00:23:37,710 --> 00:23:39,940
This guy ruined it for us

756
00:23:39,940 --> 00:23:42,030
You said it was #5 too right?

757
00:23:41,410 --> 00:23:44,940
"Could it be number 5?" "No there's no way"

758
00:23:44,960 --> 00:23:46,370
He clearly said it

759
00:23:45,470 --> 00:23:47,280
It was like a sneeze "Theres no way"

760
00:23:48,840 --> 00:23:50,930
"I ate all of them, there's no way"

761
00:23:51,460 --> 00:23:53,870
You really remember it huh?
