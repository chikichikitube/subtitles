1
00:00:24,480 --> 00:00:27,670
Documental is like a mental game right?

2
00:00:27,670 --> 00:00:31,780
I have yet to be in a situation where I am
driven into a corner like an animal

3
00:00:31,780 --> 00:00:37,890
in a life and death situation, trying to figure out how to escape

4
00:00:37,890 --> 00:00:41,070
Basically its a very uncertain thing whether someone

5
00:00:41,070 --> 00:00:46,840
will laugh at something that you think is funny or not...

6
00:00:46,840 --> 00:00:49,400
One can laugh at anything

7
00:00:49,400 --> 00:00:52,320
When its something funny

8
00:00:52,320 --> 00:00:55,210
and even when its not

9
00:00:56,470 --> 00:01:03,250
[Recap}

10
00:01:04,580 --> 00:01:07,490
To make someone laugh you have to
be creative

11
00:01:07,510 --> 00:01:09,630
and you try to think outside the box

12
00:01:09,630 --> 00:01:11,920
Its gets really difficult when you keep thinking

13
00:01:11,920 --> 00:01:20,340
about which thing will make them laugh and which wont

14
00:02:27,950 --> 00:02:57,930
[Recap]

15
00:03:19,560 --> 00:03:21,110
Alright

16
00:03:27,280 --> 00:03:28,620
Is the meat done?

17
00:03:29,180 --> 00:03:30,990
-Its done but..
-Thank you

18
00:03:31,070 --> 00:03:32,730
-Are you gonna eat?
-Yes

19
00:03:32,850 --> 00:03:35,090
Kurosawa-chan you dont have a mirror by any chance?

20
00:03:35,760 --> 00:03:38,690
-Ah I just have this
-Oh thats fine too, thank you

21
00:03:38,710 --> 00:03:39,410
-Mirror?Theres a mirror in there too

22
00:03:39,450 --> 00:03:42,390
Oh I just thought it was way over there

23
00:03:43,390 --> 00:03:45,590
You are using that to wipe it off?

24
00:03:45,710 --> 00:03:46,590
Yeah

25
00:03:51,850 --> 00:03:53,530
Thats just one sheet

26
00:03:53,530 --> 00:03:56,640
-You cant take it all off with one
-I dont need to take all of it off

27
00:03:56,640 --> 00:03:58,080
-Eh?
-Eh?really?

28
00:03:58,080 --> 00:04:00,360
It sucks but thats all I have

29
00:04:00,500 --> 00:04:03,500
Most of it comes off with one wipe

30
00:04:03,500 --> 00:04:04,430
Its really bright

31
00:04:04,490 --> 00:04:08,840
If you do it fast it doesnt come off, so you have to

32
00:04:08,840 --> 00:04:10,260
slowly do it

33
00:04:10,260 --> 00:04:11,920
Oh it all comes off you do that?

34
00:04:12,920 --> 00:04:16,990
-You have to keep doing it like this
-The face looks so small now

35
00:04:17,680 --> 00:04:20,250
-The face seems tiny

36
00:04:20,310 --> 00:04:22,910
-Oh wow! Thank you so much
-That looks amazing

37
00:04:23,400 --> 00:04:24,480
-Meats ready!
-That looks amazing

38
00:04:24,480 --> 00:04:29,470
-Meats ready!
-That looks amazing

39
00:04:29,990 --> 00:04:32,990
Thank you Miyasako-san

40
00:04:33,150 --> 00:04:35,690
-Wow
-That looks delicious!

41
00:04:35,690 --> 00:04:35,720
-As if from a Restaurant
-Yummy
-Wow
-That looks delicious!

42
00:04:35,720 --> 00:04:37,690
-As if from a Restaurant
-Yummy

43
00:04:39,820 --> 00:04:43,020
-It looks amazing!
-Delicious looking

44
00:04:43,520 --> 00:04:44,520
Seriously, looks amazing

45
00:04:44,710 --> 00:04:46,050
Oh you cant eat it

46
00:04:46,340 --> 00:04:49,030
-Huh?
-Eh?

47
00:04:49,230 --> 00:04:49,730
Since I cooked it

48
00:04:49,990 --> 00:04:51,410
-Eh?
-Eh?

49
00:04:51,410 --> 00:04:51,750
Eh?
-Eh?
-Eh?

50
00:04:51,750 --> 00:04:52,590
Eh?

51
00:04:52,590 --> 00:04:54,210
I just only said that its done
Eh?

52
00:04:54,290 --> 00:04:56,110
But you didn't bring this meat, did you?

53
00:04:57,130 --> 00:05:00,510
Anyone can eat it if they cook it, and since I am the chef

54
00:05:00,570 --> 00:05:02,890
But earlier you said it was for everyone right?

55
00:05:03,110 --> 00:05:05,630
No, I meant I will show everyone how its cooked

56
00:05:06,090 --> 00:05:08,620
-Eh?
-Eh?

57
00:05:08,450 --> 00:05:09,610
-Huh?
-Eh?

58
00:05:09,560 --> 00:05:11,560
Eh?

59
00:05:11,350 --> 00:05:12,390
Eh?

60
00:05:12,920 --> 00:05:14,920
-Eh?

61
00:05:15,480 --> 00:05:16,440
Hmm?

62
00:05:16,440 --> 00:05:19,170
-We really cant eat it?
-No, its only for me

63
00:05:19,250 --> 00:05:21,170
-One person cant finish it
- Theres  alot of meat

64
00:05:21,230 --> 00:05:22,530
-There will be leftovers

65
00:05:22,630 --> 00:05:24,150
-Eh?
-Eh?

66
00:05:24,150 --> 00:05:26,110
huh?

67
00:05:26,110 --> 00:05:31,160
You know you are not supposed to eat the leftover food
at a restaurant

68
00:05:31,160 --> 00:05:34,910
It looks really good
I am gonna take some

69
00:05:34,990 --> 00:05:37,090
With the Okinawan Sauce

70
00:05:37,120 --> 00:05:39,120
A-1 Sauce

71
00:05:39,500 --> 00:05:42,790
Adds a little kick to it

72
00:05:43,830 --> 00:05:45,280
Delicious!

73
00:05:45,280 --> 00:05:48,960
-I'll try it too
- Lets try it

74
00:05:49,710 --> 00:05:51,250
-Ah, ah
-Ah

75
00:05:53,360 --> 00:05:55,360
-eh?

76
00:05:56,030 --> 00:05:57,690
Alright I am full, I am gonna put it away

77
00:05:57,750 --> 00:05:59,910
-No dont do that
-No

78
00:06:01,660 --> 00:06:03,660
Alright , then

79
00:06:04,050 --> 00:06:06,420
Ok, If you do a gag then you can eat it

80
00:06:07,260 --> 00:06:10,430
-Why cant we eat it without doing that?
-Do you want to eat or not?

81
00:06:10,550 --> 00:06:12,120
You cant get it for nothing

82
00:06:12,270 --> 00:06:13,610
So what should we do?

83
00:06:13,730 --> 00:06:15,990
Some kind of gag or impression

84
00:06:16,130 --> 00:06:18,420
Thats a little weird

85
00:06:18,490 --> 00:06:20,970
Can you show us an example? I dont know what thing to do

86
00:06:21,890 --> 00:06:23,650
Anything really, something original

87
00:06:23,670 --> 00:06:26,510
Like something like this?

88
00:06:24,620 --> 00:06:28,690
Yeah?

89
00:06:28,690 --> 00:06:30,920
-That kind of gag?
-Like that?

90
00:06:30,930 --> 00:06:36,790
-Do like an introductory gag
-Oh so "Hello" and then

91
00:06:36,790 --> 00:06:39,240
-Is it something like that?
-That would be an introductory gag

92
00:06:39,240 --> 00:06:42,080
-Hows that?

93
00:06:42,210 --> 00:06:43,450
-Alright you can eat it
-Ah, thank you

94
00:06:43,650 --> 00:06:45,390
-Eh?
-Huh?

95
00:06:45,590 --> 00:06:48,230
-Its because I did the gag
-Really?

96
00:06:48,420 --> 00:06:51,550
-Thats how it should be
-Yeah

97
00:06:51,550 --> 00:06:54,000
This looks really good

98
00:06:58,310 --> 00:07:00,760
What are you doing?

99
00:07:03,130 --> 00:07:06,080
Why not just eat it right away?

100
00:07:06,080 --> 00:07:09,050
-I was just practicing, like golf
-Practicing how to eat?

101
00:07:09,250 --> 00:07:10,950
-You need to practice that?
-Yeah

102
00:07:11,330 --> 00:07:14,610

-That was perfect
-Right?

110
00:07:37,270 --> 00:07:40,470
I am a nosey person

111
00:07:40,530 --> 00:07:43,260
[Laughter]

112
00:07:43,260 --> 00:07:46,150
Hes a snotty kid

113
00:07:46,150 --> 00:07:47,400
Ku-chan just laughed,right?

114
00:07:48,690 --> 00:07:50,390
-I wasnt laughing

115
00:07:50,440 --> 00:07:52,930
-It wasnt you?
-Who was it?

116
00:07:52,930 --> 00:07:55,310
-I just did that, is that not allowed?
-Eh

117
00:07:55,310 --> 00:07:57,430

118
00:07:57,430 --> 00:08:00,760

00:08:00,760 --> 00:08:03,850
-This time theres two people
-Eh?really?

00:08:03,850 --> 00:08:07,870
-And Daigo gets a point
-Yeah

121
00:08:07,870 --> 00:08:10,990
-Ku-chan was a little..
-Ah, no

122
00:08:10,990 --> 00:08:11,960
Aaah

123
00:08:11,960 --> 00:08:14,650
-Ok lets see whether Ku-chan laughed or not

124
00:08:14,750 --> 00:08:17,270
It did seem like he was

125
00:08:17,310 --> 00:08:22,970
-Ah I see, but its not certain right?
-Yeah so lets watch it

126
00:08:22,970 --> 00:08:25,430
-Hows that?

127
00:08:25,750 --> 00:08:28,450
I am a nosey person

128
00:08:30,740 --> 00:08:32,590
-Thank you

129
00:08:32,590 --> 00:08:34,970
It was really quick, I wasnt laughing right?

130
00:08:35,110 --> 00:08:36,670
Right, it wasnt a laugh right?

131
00:08:36,640 --> 00:08:40,150
-Ah so what should we do? Is Ku-chan in the clear?
Ok hes clear

132
00:08:40,150 --> 00:08:43,390

136
00:08:53,870 --> 00:08:57,750
-How about that?
-Is that considered laughing?

137
00:08:57,750 --> 00:09:01,260
That was a bit too much

138
00:09:01,260 --> 00:09:03,530
-Really?
-Yeah

139
00:09:04,420 --> 00:09:06,420
-Seriously?

140
00:09:06,470 --> 00:09:08,130
-Ok I accept that

141
00:09:08,130 --> 00:09:09,800

144
00:09:14,830 --> 00:09:18,010
-Is something wrong with you or what?
-No thats not it at all

145
00:09:18,190 --> 00:09:20,730
-Thats weird, he doesnt laugh at all
-Thats not true

146
00:09:20,810 --> 00:09:23,260
-Yeah but he doesnt have any points either

147
00:09:23,260 --> 00:09:26,820
-Yeah hes at zero right?
-Yeah nothing so far

148
00:09:26,820 --> 00:09:28,860
But what about when I drank milk?

149
00:09:28,860 --> 00:09:33,140
-I wonder what he will do
-We gotta make him laugh

150
00:09:33,140 --> 00:09:33,780
Right?

151
00:09:33,780 --> 00:09:36,950
We gotta make it even

152
00:09:36,950 --> 00:09:40,250
Right?

153
00:09:41,190 --> 00:09:43,330
[Clock Beep]

154
00:09:43,330 --> 00:09:45,230
Here we go again

155
00:09:45,270 --> 00:09:46,920
Its really juicy inside

156
00:09:49,930 --> 00:09:51,010
Its really good

157
00:09:51,010 --> 00:09:55,660
I think everyone forgot about Zombie Time

158
00:09:55,660 --> 00:09:57,270
-So good
-Its delicious, right?

159
00:09:57,270 --> 00:10:04,400
Its the first time that
one zombie is against 9 people

160
00:10:11,470 --> 00:10:15,050
Zombie time

161
00:10:15,240 --> 00:10:17,000
Oh! I forgot about that

162
00:10:17,000 --> 00:10:20,470
Isnt it just Nobu?
-Just him?

163
00:10:20,470 --> 00:10:22,330
-Just one person?

164
00:10:22,330 --> 00:10:25,840
I dont think anyones gonna be laughing

165
00:10:25,840 --> 00:10:28,860
I agree

166
00:10:29,100 --> 00:10:31,060
Oi! Oi

167
00:10:31,060 --> 00:10:32,630
Eh?

168
00:10:32,630 --> 00:10:36,190
Madness! Its crazy out there

169
00:10:37,950 --> 00:10:42,260
Zombie room is flooded this high

170
00:10:42,720 --> 00:10:43,660
Eh?

171
00:10:43,660 --> 00:10:48,200
Inside the Zombie Room, this high

172
00:10:48,360 --> 00:10:50,750
All the way here

173
00:10:50,840 --> 00:10:53,830
-But his back is completely dry
-It really is

174
00:10:54,620 --> 00:10:56,170
Just the front?

175
00:10:56,170 --> 00:11:01,580
-Were you floating like this?
-This high

176
00:11:02,260 --> 00:11:04,260
Eh?

177
00:11:05,330 --> 00:11:08,330
I was like this

178
00:11:09,190 --> 00:11:10,790
Really?

179
00:11:11,210 --> 00:11:16,000
Prepare yourselves, Zombie Room is really scary

180
00:11:16,000 --> 00:11:20,110
-Theres water in the hallway too?
-As soon as you enter?

181
00:11:20,270 --> 00:11:22,370
They throw you in there like that

182
00:11:21,550 --> 00:11:23,000
So hallway too?

183
00:11:23,000 --> 00:11:25,610
They throw you in there yet your back is dry?

184

00:11:27,010 --> 00:11:28,540
Yeah all this time

186
00:11:28,540 --> 00:11:31,640
-Thats not a way to treat people

187
00:11:31,640 --> 00:11:34,280
and under the water too

188
00:11:34,280 --> 00:11:36,350
What was under the water?

189
00:11:36,350 --> 00:11:40,190
-A Spear-wielding knight doing this
-A knight?

190
00:11:40,190 --> 00:11:44,800
-The Knight, what was he like?
-This tall

191
00:11:44,800 --> 00:11:50,770
-like a Ninja?
-It wasnt just a statue?

192
00:11:50,770 --> 00:11:56,110
-From all sides he was doing this
-A spear-wielding knight?

193
00:11:56,350 --> 00:11:58,090

197
00:12:14,560 --> 00:12:16,560
-Really?

00:12:21,360 --> 00:12:23,590
You saw her today?

201
00:12:23,590 --> 00:12:25,300

202
00:12:25,300 --> 00:12:28,640
-Then how did you get that?
-Who gave it to you?

203
00:12:28,640 --> 00:12:32,140

00:12:32,210 --> 00:12:35,290
-Shes the special guest this time?
-Really?

205
00:12:35,430 --> 00:12:36,030
Seriously?

206
00:12:35,870 --> 00:12:37,450
Right next to Matsumoto Daichi

207
00:12:37,450 --> 00:12:42,790
So theres two MC's?

208

From the flower side,  batter number 4

211
00:12:58,950 --> 00:13:01,510
Is it a good idea to do this
in front of Daichi-san?

212
00:13:01,670 --> 00:13:04,030
They are watching right now

213
00:13:03,240 --> 00:13:06,050
Thats not gonna look good

214
00:13:07,030 --> 00:13:12,820

00:13:12,820 --> 00:13:19,200

Yeah its not too bad

220
00:13:28,840 --> 00:13:30,330
Its a bit like Steak-don
(don=rice bowl)

221
00:13:30,330 --> 00:13:31,800
-Right?
-Yeah

222
00:13:31,800 --> 00:13:33,670
-It would be great with lettuce right?

223
00:13:33,830 --> 00:13:36,120
I'll be back again

224
00:13:37,820 --> 00:13:39,860

I'll be back later

226
00:13:46,400 --> 00:13:49,910
It goes really well with it

227
00:13:51,120 --> 00:13:53,960
If that zombie had kept going

228
00:13:53,960 --> 00:13:55,790
-He would have started crying

229
00:13:55,790 --> 00:13:58,970
-He has a very strong spirit, however
-He really does

230
00:13:59,090 --> 00:14:02,510
Maybe when he goes home today
hes gonna cry

231
00:14:11,690 --> 00:14:14,350
-It got a bit quiet
-huh?

232

It got a little quiet right?
-Yeah a little bit

233
00:14:18,080 --> 00:14:19,980
Lets roll over

234
00:14:19,980 --> 00:14:24,620
If you roll over, you might break your fingers

235
00:14:51,530 --> 00:14:53,760
-Who is it?
-Who is that?

236
00:14:53,760 --> 00:14:57,380

-Theres no one like that
-Right?

241
00:15:10,070 --> 00:15:11,350
You said Barbecue Wasada?

242
00:15:11,790 --> 00:15:13,460
-Its Pappara.

243
00:15:15,570 --> 00:15:17,510

245
00:15:19,230 --> 00:15:21,030

246
00:15:21,210 --> 00:15:23,890
-Isnt that just tape?
-No its a hat

247
00:15:24,010 --> 00:15:27,080
-Its a hat
-What did you come here for?

248
00:15:27,080 --> 00:15:31,580
-What did you come here for?
-Thats a good move

249
00:15:31,580 --> 00:15:33,060
Is  that Yamamoto Shinya?

250
00:15:33,060 --> 00:15:35,970
Hes impersonating him

251
00:15:35,970 --> 00:15:42,560
Its a game
You shouldnt let your feelings out in a game

252
00:15:42,590 --> 00:15:43,690
Huh?

253
00:15:43,770 --> 00:15:47,410
Controlling your emotions is a strong point

254
00:15:47,510 --> 00:15:49,760
Ah if you want to play a good match
you should hide your weaknesses?

255
00:15:49,810 --> 00:15:50,470
Yeah, exactly

256
00:15:50,590 --> 00:15:53,600
He is Barbecue Suikichi-san?

257
00:15:53,600 --> 00:15:56,650
-He changed it a few times and now..
-Funky

258
00:15:57,360 --> 00:15:59,360
-Funky,. isnt that just your normal voice?
-Why?

259
00:16:09,760 --> 00:16:12,480
Are you Pappara-san?

260
00:16:13,110 --> 00:16:15,010
Oh, me?

261
00:16:15,010 --> 00:16:18,210
Nishioka... Sumiko

262
00:16:21,910 --> 00:16:25,030
Nishioka Sumiko?

263
00:16:25,070 --> 00:16:27,250
No way! You came here?

264
00:16:27,600 --> 00:16:30,210
Can I go back to normal now?

265
00:16:30,210 --> 00:16:32,440
Eh?

266
00:16:32,440 --> 00:16:35,790
You werent forced to do it

267
00:16:37,110 --> 00:16:40,310
It became a little complicated right?

268
00:16:40,470 --> 00:16:42,040
Became too complicated

269
00:16:42,040 --> 00:16:45,170
Doing Bakufu Slump's impression is pretty difficult

270
00:16:45,310 --> 00:16:48,570
-You were changing it too much tho right?
-Yeah

271
00:16:48,570 --> 00:16:50,950
-I didnt know what you were trying to do

272
00:16:50,990 --> 00:16:52,920
I was trying to do multiple impressions

273
00:16:52,980 --> 00:16:55,210
Oh so thats what you were trying to do?

274
00:16:55,930 --> 00:16:58,170
Here he comes

275
00:17:00,480 --> 00:17:04,790
He took so long just for this?

276
00:17:04,790 --> 00:17:06,290
Wow

277
00:17:06,290 --> 00:17:11,640
You were in there for so long, for this?

278
00:17:11,640 --> 00:17:15,410
-Oh it was a little hot so I went and changed

279
00:17:15,930 --> 00:17:16,810
-But earlier...

280
00:17:17,650 --> 00:17:19,210
What made you think

281
00:17:19,510 --> 00:17:20,950
Huh?

282
00:17:21,930 --> 00:17:23,390
What is that?

283
00:17:23,480 --> 00:17:26,750
-They are overalls, Its really hot so..
-I know they are overalls

284
00:17:26,750 --> 00:17:28,360
Thats the reason?

285
00:17:28,360 --> 00:17:29,680
Yeah

286
00:17:29,680 --> 00:17:31,300
Whats funny about that?

287
00:17:31,300 --> 00:17:33,860
Funny?

288
00:17:33,880 --> 00:17:35,730
Eh?

289
00:17:35,730 --> 00:17:39,760
But if you wanted to make us laugh

290
00:17:39,990 --> 00:17:43,910
How is wearing those overalls any funny?

291
00:17:43,910 --> 00:17:46,010
Funny?

292
00:17:46,010 --> 00:17:50,820
-Its not supposed to make us laugh?
-Not at all

293
00:17:51,050 --> 00:17:53,360
I just changed because its hot

294
00:17:53,360 --> 00:17:56,960
-We are not children you know
-You are not children?

295
00:17:56,960 --> 00:17:59,600
We are adults so we wouldnt laugh at that

296
00:17:59,600 --> 00:18:02,340
Because you are trying hard not to?

297
00:18:02,340 --> 00:18:06,970
Not just because of that

298
00:18:06,970 --> 00:18:09,190
-Its open from the side
-huh?

299
00:18:09,290 --> 00:18:10,960
-Its open there
-on the side

300
00:18:11,350 --> 00:18:12,740
-We can see it

301
00:18:12,740 --> 00:18:14,520
-You can see it
-Right here

302
00:18:14,520 --> 00:18:17,980
Why? it fits well

-Thats a long time

312
00:18:45,750 --> 00:18:48,030

314
00:18:50,170 --> 00:18:52,290

-That was sudden
-Thats dangerous

345
00:21:11,850 --> 00:21:14,830

00:34:36,670 --> 00:34:40,010
What color is it?

551
00:34:40,010 --> 00:34:41,200
You are looking for it?

552
00:34:41,200 --> 00:34:43,090
Yeah

553
00:34:43,090 --> 00:34:45,600
How did you lose the wallet?

554
00:34:45,600 --> 00:34:48,040
Eh?

555
00:34:53,820 --> 00:34:55,560

That took really long
-Sorry

576
00:36:39,650 --> 00:36:44,500
That just went on and on

577
00:36:44,500 --> 00:36:46,430
-Daigo!
-Eh?

578
00:36:46,430 --> 00:36:48,490
-Really? it was him?

579
00:36:48,490 --> 00:36:54,700
He had been slightly smiling for a really long time

580
00:36:54,700 --> 00:36:59,010

-This is definitely
-Yeah, that was a smile

585
00:37:19,280 --> 00:37:22,880
I already had an orange didnt it?
-Yeah

586
00:37:22,880 --> 00:37:27,320
-Really?
-Yeah so he will be eliminated and become a zombie

587
00:37:32,300 --> 00:37:35,570
Now we will have a tough zombie

588
00:37:35,570 --> 00:37:39,830
We were all thinking he probably cant
do much as a zombie

589
00:37:39,830 --> 00:37:43,110
-Alright lets go, Daigo
-Daigo will be a zombie now

590
00:37:43,110 --> 00:37:46,270
It should go faster from now on

591
00:37:46,420 --> 00:37:48,420
But you know Kuro-chan
still hasnt gotten anything

592
00:37:48,770 --> 00:37:50,190
-Thats true
-Seriously

593
00:37:50,250 --> 00:37:52,120
Kuro-chan doesnt laugh at all

594
00:37:52,120 --> 00:37:57,990
Kuro-chan what can we do to make you laugh?
-No idea

595
00:38:01,660 --> 00:38:04,370
Ah why did this happen

596
00:38:04,370 --> 00:38:06,880
I am not really sure myself

597
00:38:07,610 --> 00:38:15,200
It was difficult to maintain a "straight" face, because
my normal face seems like a smile

598
00:38:15,200 --> 00:38:19,270
So I had to really force it

599
00:38:19,310 --> 00:38:22,390
It was a learning experience but

600
00:38:25,300 --> 00:38:29,570
You cant help but laugh at those 4

601
00:38:30,830 --> 00:38:33,300
Especially when the "animal" entered

602
00:38:33,300 --> 00:38:37,520
That bit was really good

Lets all try to make him laugh

606
00:38:55,920 --> 00:38:57,080
-I agree

607
00:38:58,050 --> 00:39:01,370
Its like nothing makes him laugh
-Can he even laugh?

608
00:39:03,840 --> 00:39:07,090
Its hard to know what to do

609
00:39:07,090 --> 00:39:11,000
Ah- can you do it slowly please?

610
00:39:11,000 --> 00:39:14,800
Sorry, It hurts if you do it fast

611
00:39:15,110 --> 00:39:16,210

Who brought this porno mag here?

694
00:44:44,740 --> 00:44:46,950
Do you think its appropriate?

695
00:44:46,950 --> 00:44:49,880
To bring it to a place like this?

696
00:44:50,220 --> 00:44:53,990
What were you thinking?

697
00:44:56,360 --> 00:45:01,310
Who was it?

698
00:45:07,330 --> 00:45:09,720

That was a hard one
( ͡° ͜ʖ ͡°)

701
00:45:13,710 --> 00:45:15,770
How can you get hard in this situation?
Are you serious?

702
00:45:16,600 --> 00:45:20,080
but Miyazawa-san actually got you erect

703
00:45:21,420 --> 00:45:23,420
Howc can you even get hard in this situation?

704
00:45:23,740 --> 00:45:27,420
Its Iio

705
00:45:27,420 --> 00:45:31,750
It would be really hard to get erect in this kind of situation

706
00:45:32,290 --> 00:45:34,290
Who is it?

707
00:45:34,590 --> 00:45:38,000
Who is it? Its you!

708
00:45:38,000 --> 00:45:40,260
Its Iio

709
00:45:41,920 --> 00:45:44,910
Who brought this porno mag here?

710
00:45:47,810 --> 00:45:50,020
Do you think its appropriate?

711
00:45:50,020 --> 00:45:51,760
Bringing it to a place like this

712
00:45:53,960 --> 00:45:56,830
What were you thinking?

713
00:46:00,050 --> 00:46:04,390
Who was it?

714
00:46:07,950 --> 00:46:13,550
Since you already had an orange, you will be eliminated

715
00:46:20,230 --> 00:46:25,790
-I wonder what made him crack
-Definitely the penis

716
00:46:25,890 --> 00:46:29,260
-This really is a first isnt it?
-So it seems

717
00:46:29,390 --> 00:46:34,070
To get hard in this kind of situation
it really is unprecedented

718
00:46:34,650 --> 00:46:40,290
Well done, Iio-san

719
00:46:40,290 --> 00:46:41,900
It was a pleasure

720
00:46:41,900 --> 00:46:44,900
Thank you very  much

721
00:46:44,990 --> 00:46:46,460

he would do something like that

725
00:46:56,310 --> 00:46:58,490
It made me laugh

726
00:47:02,100 --> 00:47:03,410
When Matsumoto-san entered

727
00:47:03,410 --> 00:47:06,160
he didnt have any doubt who it was

728
00:47:06,590 --> 00:47:10,610
When he entered he was laughing so
It definitely was a funny thing

729
00:47:10,610 --> 00:47:12,630
and that was  bit of a relief
that he found it funny too

730
00:47:12,630 --> 00:47:15,770

731
00:47:20,180 --> 00:47:22,070
--

732
00:47:22,070 --> 00:47:25,310
-Kuro-chan you still dont have anything right?

00:47:25,310 --> 00:47:27,800
-Like in general, what do you find funny?

734
00:47:27,800 --> 00:47:32,190
Axel Hopper-san

735
00:47:32,190 --> 00:47:34,520
-No way!
-Are you serious?

736
00:47:34,530 --> 00:47:37,990
I really like his act

737
00:47:38,030 --> 00:47:39,960
Other than that I am not really sure

738
00:47:41,250 --> 00:47:43,530

739
00:47:43,610 --> 00:47:45,610

745
00:48:14,060 --> 00:48:18,490
Why are you getting mad?
-We dont know how to make you laugh

746
00:48:18,650 --> 00:48:19,650

Ok Normally, what do you laugh at?
-I really like dirty humor

748
00:48:22,940 --> 00:48:24,870
But you didnt laugh at Miyasakos bit

749
00:48:24,930 --> 00:48:27,790
That just seemed too serious so I was surprised

750
00:48:27,970 --> 00:48:29,170

768
00:49:51,090 --> 00:49:54,690
How do you want me to touch them?
-Miyasako-san are you gonna touch them?

769
00:49:54,710 --> 00:49:56,390
Yeah

770
00:49:56,740 --> 00:50:00,990

00:50:35,640 --> 00:50:37,580
-You are looking right?

780
00:50:46,190 --> 00:50:49,250

00:52:24,330 --> 00:52:26,720
For the sake of making you laugh

814
00:52:26,720 --> 00:52:31,620

815
00:52:32,400 --> 00:52:34,350

-But finally, someone made him laugh

824
00:53:03,990 --> 00:53:07,310
-I was able to hold it in during Jun-san's bit but

825
00:53:07,470 --> 00:53:12,870
-When I was passing him the paper towel
and he said "dont give me so little"

826
00:53:13,030 --> 00:53:15,610
I was thinking maybe he got some on his hand

827
00:53:16,510 --> 00:53:19,220
So thats what you were laughing at?

828
00:53:21,360 --> 00:53:23,360
