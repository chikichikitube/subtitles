2
00:00:07,190 --> 00:00:08,620
Well, Matsumoto-san.
-Yes.

3
00:00:08,720 --> 00:00:12,060
The last time, we tricked Imada with the Harisame soup.

4
00:00:12,060 --> 00:00:14,290
Yeah we did, that was...

5
00:00:15,330 --> 00:00:17,430
the summer 2 years ago.

6
00:00:18,030 --> 00:00:22,000
He was so happy he was going to buy a Ferrari.

7
00:00:22,030 --> 00:00:24,670
After he was kind of depressed.
-When he found out it was a prank.

8
00:00:25,100 --> 00:00:27,540
Well, it's been 2 years.

9
00:00:28,110 --> 00:00:30,140
Today, we'll be tricking everyone.

10
00:00:31,140 --> 00:00:33,110
Not only one.
-Yes, everyone.

11
00:00:33,850 --> 00:00:34,880
It's everyone.

12
00:00:35,450 --> 00:00:36,720
The prank.

13
00:00:36,920 --> 00:00:38,880
The person behind this is.

14
00:00:37,250 --> 00:09:17,070
GAKIFILES SUBS

15
00:00:39,620 --> 00:00:41,650
Osaki Hiroshi from Yoshimoto Kogyo.

16
00:00:40,690 --> 00:00:45,260
(Yoshimoto Kogyo)

17
00:00:40,690 --> 00:00:45,260
Osaki Hiroshi - Producer

18
00:00:40,690 --> 00:00:45,260
Trickster

19
00:00:41,650 --> 00:00:46,760
I'm not a trickster, I'm just doing what they told me to do.

20
00:00:47,260 --> 00:00:49,730
So you rank under Okamoto?
-Yes, I do.

21
00:00:51,030 --> 00:00:52,960
I'm just a peon.

22
00:00:54,000 --> 00:00:57,070
Anyway, we're going to be in the room together.

23
00:00:57,500 --> 00:01:00,370
Osaki will come and talk to us.

24
00:00:58,900 --> 00:00:59,500
He'll come out.

25
00:01:00,370 --> 00:01:01,810
Because it's rare to see him.
-Yes.

26
00:01:02,110 --> 00:01:05,380
He will ask to speak to us privately.

27
00:01:06,040 --> 00:01:08,380
The 3 of us will talk in the back.

28
00:01:08,810 --> 00:01:10,250
Then we start fighting.

29
00:01:11,980 --> 00:01:16,320
We can show you now, what will happen.

30
00:01:18,460 --> 00:01:22,560
Fuji TV - 6th Dressing Room

31
00:01:23,630 --> 00:01:27,370
Team Fight Members Waiting For The Rehearsal

32
00:01:26,230 --> 00:01:28,730
I don't eat this stuff.

33
00:01:29,000 --> 00:01:30,040
Isn't it weird.

34
00:01:29,670 --> 00:01:33,740
Hamada Appears As Usual

35
00:01:38,680 --> 00:01:41,850
5 Minutes Later Mr. Osaki Appears

36
00:01:39,340 --> 00:01:41,550
Hello.

37
00:01:42,650 --> 00:01:44,180
We ate already.

38
00:01:44,180 --> 00:01:46,950
Oh, we have sushi.

39
00:01:47,950 --> 00:01:49,520
Let's eat.

40
00:01:49,590 --> 00:01:50,760
I shall partake.

41
00:01:52,660 --> 00:01:57,660
10 minutes Later Matsumoto

42
00:01:52,660 --> 00:01:57,660
Appears and Looks Sleepy

43
00:01:52,720 --> 00:01:53,990
Hello.

44
00:02:05,640 --> 00:02:12,710
Osaki Starts The Prank

45
00:02:11,580 --> 00:02:13,150
Can I talk to you for a few minutes.

46
00:02:17,680 --> 00:02:18,280
What's going on?

47
00:02:23,620 --> 00:02:27,090
The 3 Of Them Enter The Back Room

48
00:02:34,630 --> 00:02:36,370
Hey Okamoto!  Where's my oolong tea?

49
00:02:36,940 --> 00:02:38,370
Okamoto!
-Yes!

50
00:02:40,140 --> 00:02:40,810
I'm sorry.

51
00:02:42,840 --> 00:02:44,740
I told you about this before!

52
00:02:44,880 --> 00:02:46,280
Yes, I'm sorry.
-I told you right?

53
00:02:46,480 --> 00:02:50,820
Hamada also said that he doesn't want to do it.

54
00:02:51,120 --> 00:02:53,050
Hamada didn't mention anything about it.

55
00:02:53,050 --> 00:02:54,690
I didn't say anything.

56
00:02:55,190 --> 00:02:57,220
What ever.

57
00:02:56,690 --> 00:03:05,130
Masterful Performance

58
00:02:58,560 --> 00:03:01,290
Don't have that kind of attitude.

59
00:03:02,290 --> 00:03:03,260
It's not like that...

60
00:03:03,260 --> 00:03:06,360
I doesn't matter, I just want to quit!

61
00:03:06,530 --> 00:03:08,200
Never mind, cut it out.

62
00:03:11,270 --> 00:03:14,710
Recently, Osaki explanations aren't making sense.

63
00:03:11,770 --> 00:03:17,410
Why Is Imada Brushing His Teeth!?

64
00:03:14,810 --> 00:03:17,040
I'm not saying anything weird, it's normal.
-Not true.

65
00:03:17,110 --> 00:03:19,080
I don't like it.
-What?

66
00:03:18,580 --> 00:03:21,580
Masterful Performance

67
00:03:19,240 --> 00:03:21,780
It's hard to say, but it's different.

68
00:03:22,510 --> 00:03:25,180
Anyway, just sit down.
-Never mind.

69
00:03:25,250 --> 00:03:26,180
Sit down!

70
00:03:26,520 --> 00:03:27,120
What!

71
00:03:27,650 --> 00:03:28,120
What!

72
00:03:28,090 --> 00:03:31,020
Masterful Performance

73
00:03:28,220 --> 00:03:29,920
Just listen.

74
00:03:29,920 --> 00:03:31,920
Sit down!
-Am I the bad person?

75
00:03:31,960 --> 00:03:36,800
A Heavy Atmosphere Fills The Dressing Room!!

76
00:03:32,190 --> 00:03:33,890
I didn't say who's bad.

77
00:03:34,560 --> 00:03:36,460
What!
-Anyway, just listen.

78
00:03:37,430 --> 00:03:39,560
I just don't want to do it!

79
00:03:38,360 --> 00:03:47,610
Masterful Performance

80
00:03:39,560 --> 00:03:41,570
You can't just say that, you bastard!

81
00:03:46,140 --> 00:03:47,940
It's really, never mind.

82
00:03:48,110 --> 00:03:50,440
Stop that attitude!
-What!

83
00:03:50,440 --> 00:03:50,940
What!

84
00:03:50,940 --> 00:03:51,510
What!

85
00:03:51,510 --> 00:03:52,180
What!

86
00:03:53,910 --> 00:03:55,480
It's not what, just sit down!

87
00:03:55,480 --> 00:03:57,880
It's doesn't matter!
-Just sit down!  Damn it!

88
00:03:58,180 --> 00:03:59,420
I don't want to!

89
00:03:59,620 --> 00:04:00,920
Stop that!  Stop!

90
00:04:01,050 --> 00:04:01,950
What asshole!

91
00:04:02,590 --> 00:04:03,260
What!

92
00:04:03,260 --> 00:04:04,820
What bastard!

93
00:04:06,020 --> 00:04:07,330
That's enough, OK.

94
00:04:07,960 --> 00:04:10,130
Stop.  What is that!

95
00:04:10,430 --> 00:04:11,430
What bastard!

96
00:04:11,430 --> 00:04:12,330
What!

97
00:04:17,700 --> 00:04:18,840
You bastard!

98
00:04:20,070 --> 00:04:21,940
OK, Hama-chan wins!

99
00:04:24,780 --> 00:04:26,340
No laughter at all!

100
00:04:26,950 --> 00:04:29,080
You're supposed to be laughing.

101
00:04:29,310 --> 00:04:31,280
Excuse me, but we can't laugh.

102
00:04:33,520 --> 00:04:35,020
Not a laughing matter.

103
00:04:48,970 --> 00:04:50,970
Sorry but we were fighting over this.

104
00:04:53,000 --> 00:04:56,140
We did it so many times, that's why I didn't want to sit on the horse.

105
00:04:57,080 --> 00:04:58,740
He said "sit down" so many times..

106
00:04:59,340 --> 00:05:01,780
He was saying it from 3 months ago.

107
00:05:03,280 --> 00:05:05,980
I was listening but Hamada wasn't.

108
00:05:07,420 --> 00:05:09,220
I wanted 3 people fighting.

109
00:05:11,590 --> 00:05:13,690
The look on Imada's face...

110
00:05:15,430 --> 00:05:17,030
it was terrible.

111
00:05:22,900 --> 00:05:24,970
In all these years, it's the first time seeing that face.

112
00:05:27,540 --> 00:05:29,640
I thought Osaki had a bloody jacket on!

113
00:05:31,510 --> 00:05:32,840
It's really blood, I thought.

114
00:05:34,550 --> 00:05:37,350
I was really shocked.

115
00:05:39,250 --> 00:05:40,620
I was going to change my pants too.

116
00:05:40,690 --> 00:05:43,620
I thought I heard someone say "my thumb is hurt so I'm losing".

117
00:05:44,390 --> 00:05:45,620
Stupid.

118
00:05:47,260 --> 00:05:49,090
Why does Imada have tears.

119
00:05:49,190 --> 00:05:51,730
Imada had such a terrible face.

120
00:05:53,130 --> 00:05:54,730
He has watery eyes.

121
00:05:55,600 --> 00:05:56,200
He's crying.

122
00:05:56,200 --> 00:05:57,400
Imada is crying.

123
00:06:00,810 --> 00:06:02,610
He's really crying!

124
00:06:05,680 --> 00:06:06,910
Why?

125
00:06:09,680 --> 00:06:10,980
He's crying!

126
00:06:11,620 --> 00:06:13,120
He's crying!

127
00:06:13,590 --> 00:06:14,820
Imada... Imada!

128
00:06:14,820 --> 00:06:16,650
Imada, it's a prank.  Prank!

129
00:06:17,860 --> 00:06:19,090
Imada, it's a prank!

130
00:06:19,790 --> 00:06:21,060
Got it?

131
00:06:23,730 --> 00:06:25,060
Imada, it's just a prank.

132
00:06:25,430 --> 00:06:26,930
It was perfect!

133
00:06:29,730 --> 00:06:30,840
Imada...

134
00:06:31,770 --> 00:06:33,070
Imada, it's just a prank.

135
00:06:38,080 --> 00:06:39,810
No, I understand his feelings.

136
00:06:40,880 --> 00:06:42,080
You're too mean.

137
00:06:43,010 --> 00:06:44,320
Didn't you go too far?

138
00:06:44,320 --> 00:06:45,480
Apologize.

139
00:06:45,680 --> 00:06:47,290
Hurry and apologize.

140
00:06:47,850 --> 00:06:49,120
I'm sorry Imada.

141
00:06:50,320 --> 00:06:51,160
We're sorry.

142
00:06:51,220 --> 00:06:54,090
We're the ones fighting, why do we have to apologize to him?

143
00:06:54,930 --> 00:06:55,690
You OK?

144
00:06:55,690 --> 00:06:59,760
Usually he would be way over there.

145
00:06:59,760 --> 00:07:02,000
When I saw him on the monitor,

146
00:07:02,100 --> 00:07:05,740
he was brushing his teeth to try and peek inside the room.

147
00:07:06,670 --> 00:07:07,440
That Imada.

148
00:07:09,370 --> 00:07:10,680
Hey Imada...

149
00:07:12,010 --> 00:07:13,610
everything is not perfect in life.

150
00:07:15,110 --> 00:07:16,780
This is taking too long.

151
00:07:18,580 --> 00:07:19,550
You're OK right?

152
00:07:21,320 --> 00:07:23,020
I really thought Gottsu ee Kanji was finished.

153
00:07:24,490 --> 00:07:26,060
I thought, "I'll just go home"

154
00:07:26,060 --> 00:07:27,390
Like, what now.

155
00:07:27,390 --> 00:07:29,360
The show is over?
-It's over.

156
00:07:29,360 --> 00:07:30,530
What now?

157
00:07:34,670 --> 00:07:37,870
You guys didn't even notice it was sugar glass?
-No we didn't.

158
00:07:38,900 --> 00:07:42,110
3 guys with 3 different personalties all with hot tempers.

159
00:07:42,710 --> 00:07:45,280
Nobody could stop you.

160
00:07:45,740 --> 00:07:49,210
Let's ask Imada what he thought.

161
00:07:49,480 --> 00:07:51,150
He cried!

162
00:07:54,120 --> 00:07:55,220
Well...

163
00:07:56,120 --> 00:07:57,690
with everything put together...

164
00:07:57,990 --> 00:07:59,760
I guess it went really well.

165
00:08:01,530 --> 00:08:02,860
It made me cry.

166
00:08:02,860 --> 00:08:03,760
You sound nasally.

167
00:08:05,730 --> 00:08:07,330
But really...

168
00:08:07,470 --> 00:08:08,470
What did you think?

169
00:08:08,470 --> 00:08:10,970
I just thought, I had to stop you guys all by myself.

170
00:08:12,870 --> 00:08:13,670
Thank goodness though.

171
00:08:13,670 --> 00:08:15,670
Yeah, thank goodness.

172
00:08:20,830 --> 00:08:23,270
You guys were very good.

173
00:08:28,210 --> 00:08:29,010
That was scary.

174
00:08:30,440 --> 00:08:32,410
I just couldn't take it as a joke.

175
00:08:32,610 --> 00:08:34,310
The CCD is amazing.

176
00:08:34,750 --> 00:08:38,690
I thought when we broke through the glass, everyone was going to laugh.

177
00:08:38,750 --> 00:08:42,090
I saw Imada, I thought what kind of face is that.

178
00:08:43,060 --> 00:08:44,890
I kind of thought...

179
00:08:45,560 --> 00:08:46,990
our timing was off.
-Yeah.

180
00:08:48,660 --> 00:08:51,500
It was his idea from the start, evil person.

181
00:08:51,930 --> 00:08:53,970
Be strong!
-Machan team...

182
00:08:54,070 --> 00:08:55,540
Did you stop crying?

183
00:08:58,740 --> 00:09:00,170
Please don't mention that!

184
00:09:00,540 --> 00:09:03,410
We won't cut that part out.
-Please cut it out.

185
00:09:03,680 --> 00:09:05,410
He was bawling earlier.

186
00:09:05,580 --> 00:09:07,010
What he was crying?

187
00:09:07,010 --> 00:09:08,580
The tears were just flowing.

188
00:09:09,180 --> 00:09:11,120
Please don't air this.

189
00:09:11,120 --> 00:09:12,390
We wont cut it out.

190
00:09:12,390 --> 00:09:13,650
Please cut it out.

191
00:09:13,650 --> 00:09:14,960
I'll pay you to cut it out.

192
00:09:15,690 --> 00:09:16,820
I'll pay you.

193
00:09:16,890 --> 00:09:18,490
We have enough money.

194
00:09:18,490 --> 00:09:21,300
Such sarcasm.
