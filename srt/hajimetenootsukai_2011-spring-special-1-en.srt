00:00:01,160 --> 00:00:05,180
We will bring you the smiles of children.

3
00:00:05,180 --> 00:00:10,400
Can't wait until summer!

4
00:00:05,180 --> 00:00:10,400
My First Errand - Can't Wait Until Summer Special

5
00:00:05,180 --> 00:00:10,400
Spring Special

6
00:00:10,400 --> 00:00:17,220
My First Errand staff room

7
00:00:10,460 --> 00:00:14,580
The spring special.
That's not something to miss.

8
00:00:10,900 --> 00:00:14,300
Tokoro George

9
00:00:14,580 --> 00:00:17,720
From now on it will get warmer
and the summer is coming.

10
00:00:17,720 --> 00:00:20,540
And they grow up so fast before us.

11
00:00:20,540 --> 00:00:23,820
The smiles of children,
well there are tears too.

12
00:00:23,820 --> 00:00:26,180
Those are all things of passion.

13
00:00:26,180 --> 00:00:27,600
Be sure to watch.

14
00:00:28,580 --> 00:00:33,940
The first smile on our program today comes from the big adventure of the coconut daughter.

15
00:00:34,780 --> 00:00:36,720
1 hour from Toshin by train.

16
00:00:36,380 --> 00:00:41,600
Saitama ● Ogawa City

17
00:00:37,180 --> 00:00:41,860
The first errand is in Saitama Prefecture, Ogawa which overlooks the mountains of Chichibu.

18
00:00:42,480 --> 00:00:47,160
Narrator:
Chikaishi Shinsuke

19
00:00:42,860 --> 00:00:47,500
Today is open school day for parents whose children go to the kindergarten.

20
00:00:47,920 --> 00:00:50,060
Among the mothers and fathers

21
00:00:50,060 --> 00:00:53,320
there is a mother carrying a baby on her back.

22
00:00:54,560 --> 00:01:00,120
5 years old.

23
00:00:54,560 --> 00:01:00,120
Ko
ko
na

24
00:00:54,640 --> 00:00:58,420
Kokona has become serious after becoming an older sister as of last year,

25
00:00:58,420 --> 00:01:01,560
to help her busy mother.

26
00:01:00,400 --> 00:01:01,480
She's so cute.

27
00:01:01,880 --> 00:01:07,040
Mother

28
00:01:01,980 --> 00:01:03,560
The mother is still 22 years old.

29
00:01:03,560 --> 00:01:05,440
She's so young.

30
00:01:05,440 --> 00:01:08,680
That means... if Kokona is 5 years old...

31
00:01:09,320 --> 00:01:13,220
Father. 19 years old.

32
00:01:09,320 --> 00:01:13,220
Mother. 17 years old.

33
00:01:10,880 --> 00:01:15,140
That's right. The mother gave birth to Kokona when she was 17.

34
00:01:13,340 --> 00:01:16,060
Shrine visit

35
00:01:15,900 --> 00:01:18,720
They got married when Kokona was 1 year old.

36
00:01:17,320 --> 00:01:20,200
Wedding

37
00:01:18,720 --> 00:01:21,640
When Kokona was 3, the mother went through her coming-of-age ceremony.

38
00:01:20,800 --> 00:01:25,420
Coming of age
ceremony

39
00:01:21,620 --> 00:01:25,340
Nevermind all that.
Kokona is such a great name. How did she think of it?

40
00:01:26,240 --> 00:01:29,540
When I was pregnant at 17

41
00:01:29,540 --> 00:01:31,540
there was a tanning parlor.

42
00:01:30,840 --> 00:01:34,640
Tan-pa = Tanning parlor

43
00:01:31,540 --> 00:01:35,000
I didn't have a name

44
00:01:34,980 --> 00:01:38,340
and you know the coconut oil that makes a nice smell

45
00:01:35,000 --> 00:01:39,680
Cosmetic coconut oil

46
00:01:38,340 --> 00:01:42,800
and I fell in love with the smell,

47
00:01:39,680 --> 00:01:42,560
Falling in love with coconuts.

48
00:01:42,800 --> 00:01:46,100
so I thought of making her name like coconut.

49
00:01:44,440 --> 00:01:47,860
tsu

50
00:01:44,440 --> 00:01:55,080
Kokona

51
00:01:47,480 --> 00:01:51,640
I thought that coconut would be too strange so I advised my grandparents.

52
00:01:49,700 --> 00:01:55,080
=

53
00:01:49,700 --> 00:01:56,640
Kokona

54
00:01:51,640 --> 00:01:56,140
They suggested to use the characters meaning "Peace at Heart" where the peace is the same as in the Shouwa era.

55
00:01:56,140 --> 00:01:58,540
What a great name you've given her is what people told me.

56
00:01:56,640 --> 00:02:00,880
Kokona

57
00:01:58,540 --> 00:02:01,860
You must surely have given it a lot of thought. Well...

58
00:02:03,120 --> 00:02:10,040
Little brother

59
00:02:03,120 --> 00:02:10,060
Hinata
8 months
old

60
00:02:03,800 --> 00:02:05,660
The baby is a boy.

61
00:02:05,660 --> 00:02:09,940
Today is the first time celebrating Children's Day since his birth.

62
00:02:10,360 --> 00:02:16,080
She wants prove herself for her tiny baby brother, so her mother has asked us to help with her first errand.

63
00:02:16,080 --> 00:02:17,540
- You can go and do it, right?
- Yes

64
00:02:17,540 --> 00:02:19,460
- You can do it, right?
- I can do it.

65
00:02:19,460 --> 00:02:21,920
At the stand ....

66
00:02:21,920 --> 00:02:24,760
Are you listening? Look me in the eyes and listen!!

67
00:02:24,760 --> 00:02:26,640
Mother is serious about this.

68
00:02:26,640 --> 00:02:28,640
This is important.

69
00:02:29,240 --> 00:02:32,720
What will you ask the bus driver when you get on board?

70
00:02:32,720 --> 00:02:33,680
So she's going on a bus.

71
00:02:33,680 --> 00:02:34,960
Excuse me.

72
00:02:35,060 --> 00:02:38,540
Does this bus drive to Ogawa station?

73
00:02:38,540 --> 00:02:40,840
Does this bus drive to Ogawa station?

74
00:02:39,900 --> 00:02:41,200
What does she have to buy?

75
00:02:41,200 --> 00:02:43,260
You know they sell small versions of those carp streamers.

76
00:02:43,260 --> 00:02:45,000
For Hinata's Children's Day.

77
00:02:45,000 --> 00:02:46,600
I want you to buy one of them.

78
00:02:46,280 --> 00:02:48,100
Let's keep it a secret from Hinata.

79
00:02:49,020 --> 00:02:51,140
The bus comes twice an hour.

80
00:02:51,140 --> 00:02:54,040
TN: Okara is a residue from tofu making. It's a by-product which gives it certain qualities.

81
00:02:51,140 --> 00:02:54,040
The errand includes donuts and tofu made from Okara in front of the station,

82
00:02:54,040 --> 00:02:56,380
cake and carp streamer cookie from the cake shop

83
00:02:56,380 --> 00:03:01,180
and various items from the grilled meat shop.

84
00:03:01,180 --> 00:03:03,220
Impossible.

85
00:03:02,040 --> 00:03:03,260
That's impossible.

86
00:03:02,620 --> 00:03:03,640
Say it one more time.

87
00:03:03,640 --> 00:03:07,320
- Karaage
- Do you have any Karaage, Bang Bang?

88
00:03:03,640 --> 00:03:07,320
TN: Karaage is fried chicken. Bang Bang is another kind of chicken.

89
00:03:07,440 --> 00:03:10,280
Do you have any Karaage, Bang Bang?

90
00:03:10,280 --> 00:03:11,500
Say it one more time.

91
00:03:11,500 --> 00:03:14,160
- Do you have any Karaage, Bang Bang?
- Ok.

92
00:03:14,160 --> 00:03:15,800
Yes, she can do it.

93
00:03:17,640 --> 00:03:19,180
Don't you cry if you become scared.

94
00:03:19,180 --> 00:03:21,240
What are you saying, mother?

95
00:03:21,240 --> 00:03:23,240
Don't you come back crying from being scared.

96
00:03:23,240 --> 00:03:27,660
This is her method to turn on Kokona's ambition switch.

97
00:03:27,660 --> 00:03:31,520
- Say "thank you" if you ask someone about something.

98
00:03:29,880 --> 00:03:31,520
- Yes.

99
00:03:31,520 --> 00:03:34,980
I might be a bit late. The grill shop is always so slow.

100
00:03:34,980 --> 00:03:37,760
- Don't come back drunk.
- Yes.

101
00:03:41,700 --> 00:03:46,360
An energetic Kokona is dashing forward.

102
00:03:46,360 --> 00:03:47,940
One two, one two, one two.

103
00:03:48,480 --> 00:03:49,680
However...

104
00:03:49,680 --> 00:03:51,380
Mama.

105
00:03:52,240 --> 00:03:53,400
What?

106
00:03:53,400 --> 00:03:56,040
Can I really do it?

107
00:03:56,040 --> 00:03:58,040
At that time even the mother

108
00:03:58,040 --> 00:04:00,740
is wondering if she can do it by herself.

109
00:04:01,100 --> 00:04:05,540
This is the first time for her to go through a first errand. Either for herself or someone else.

110
00:04:05,540 --> 00:04:10,260
Kokona remembers that mother packed her a rice ball.

111
00:04:10,260 --> 00:04:13,760
Holding tightly where her mother has squeezed the rice ball.

112
00:04:16,640 --> 00:04:18,700
Yes, now I've received power.

113
00:04:19,800 --> 00:04:21,760
I can do it!

114
00:04:21,760 --> 00:04:23,580
I can do it!

115
00:04:24,620 --> 00:04:27,200
The bus only comes twice an hour.

116
00:04:27,200 --> 00:04:29,460
Walking to the bus stop usually takes 15 minutes.

117
00:04:29,460 --> 00:04:33,640
She was given 3 times the time to make it there. 45 minutes.

118
00:04:33,640 --> 00:04:37,620
So she is there ahead of time.
There is still 35 minutes until the next bus.

119
00:04:39,180 --> 00:04:43,520
Her mother told her to wait in the shop in front of the bus stop in such a situation.

120
00:04:44,560 --> 00:04:45,940
Hello.

121
00:04:45,940 --> 00:04:48,240
Hello. Is the bus coming today?

122
00:04:48,540 --> 00:04:50,220
Yes, the bus will come.

123
00:04:50,260 --> 00:04:52,080
I'm going shopping by myself.

124
00:04:52,080 --> 00:04:54,820
You are going shopping by yourself? Where are you going?

125
00:04:54,820 --> 00:04:56,820
Just a little bit of pride.

126
00:04:56,820 --> 00:05:00,800
Mom told me I can buy 1 candy item.

127
00:05:01,240 --> 00:05:02,900
Since I have money.

128
00:05:04,100 --> 00:05:06,800
Having spent time shopping the bus might arrive.

129
00:05:06,800 --> 00:05:09,400
- You can cross here.
- Yes, I can cross.

130
00:05:09,400 --> 00:05:11,400
You're already going?

131
00:05:12,900 --> 00:05:16,180
It usually takes time to choose a piece of candy.

132
00:05:16,180 --> 00:05:18,540
But she was only in the shop for 5 minutes.

133
00:05:19,360 --> 00:05:24,220
I wonder if the bus is here soon.

134
00:05:21,380 --> 00:05:24,220
I wonder if the bus is here soon.

135
00:05:24,260 --> 00:05:26,840
There's still 30 minutes until the bus is coming.

136
00:05:28,420 --> 00:05:30,460
I can't see the bus at all.

137
00:05:30,860 --> 00:05:32,820
It totally isn't there.

138
00:05:32,820 --> 00:05:35,560
There's still time, right?

139
00:05:36,500 --> 00:05:39,260
Still not seeing it.

140
00:05:39,580 --> 00:05:44,020
Not doing anything and just waiting
is the hardest thing for Kokona.

141
00:05:44,020 --> 00:05:46,020
Even after she is done eating the onigiri (rice ball).

142
00:05:46,160 --> 00:05:48,420
It's not coming.

143
00:05:50,980 --> 00:05:54,400
She doesn't understand how slow time passes or how many minutes are left.

144
00:05:55,460 --> 00:05:58,360
The staff is in the same situation.

145
00:06:00,880 --> 00:06:04,300
The shop owner has been watching from inside the shop.

146
00:06:06,260 --> 00:06:08,800
I'm going shopping alone.

147
00:06:08,100 --> 00:06:09,820
By yourself? You're so great.

148
00:06:09,820 --> 00:06:13,580
I was thinking of riding the bus tomorrow. So I came by to check the schedule.

149
00:06:14,300 --> 00:06:15,720
You came to see?

150
00:06:16,260 --> 00:06:18,180
Can you wait a little bit more?

151
00:06:18,180 --> 00:06:20,760
Just wait a little more. Do your best.

152
00:06:20,760 --> 00:06:22,760
Give me some. Nice.

153
00:06:23,460 --> 00:06:25,300
Thank you, sir.

154
00:06:25,300 --> 00:06:27,720
And after waiting a bit more, the bus came.

155
00:06:28,600 --> 00:06:30,160
It's coming, coming.

156
00:06:28,940 --> 00:06:31,340
Hey, Kokona. The bus is coming.

157
00:06:31,460 --> 00:06:34,340
The bus isn't coming.

158
00:06:34,020 --> 00:06:35,780
It's right there.

159
00:06:36,880 --> 00:06:40,160
Kokona is so surprised that it is suddenly there.

160
00:06:42,420 --> 00:06:45,200
Finally. She gets to board it.

161
00:06:45,200 --> 00:06:47,780
The ones who are most relieved are the cameramen.

162
00:06:53,200 --> 00:06:55,160
I can do this!

163
00:06:59,680 --> 00:07:04,040
The bus arrives after 10 minutes.
Much less than the waiting time.

164
00:07:04,660 --> 00:07:07,980
Paying the money just like she was told by her mother...

165
00:07:07,980 --> 00:07:09,480
Thank you.

166
00:07:09,480 --> 00:07:10,880
She said it properly.

167
00:07:10,900 --> 00:07:13,020
The first place she is heading to is...

168
00:07:13,020 --> 00:07:16,700
I must go to the Okara donuts.

169
00:07:17,980 --> 00:07:21,560
In this shop they make various kinds of donuts and

170
00:07:21,560 --> 00:07:23,780
they recently started making Okara donuts.

171
00:07:23,780 --> 00:07:27,780
Excuse me, do you have cheap tofu?

172
00:07:27,780 --> 00:07:29,080
Cheap tofu.

173
00:07:28,820 --> 00:07:29,780
Cheap tofu?

174
00:07:29,780 --> 00:07:33,260
There are all kinds of tofu.

175
00:07:33,260 --> 00:07:34,860
- Yes.
- Yes.

176
00:07:34,380 --> 00:07:37,600
The mother made her get the most common tofu.

177
00:07:38,060 --> 00:07:40,140
These are donuts made from Okara.

178
00:07:40,140 --> 00:07:41,820
These are the ones.

179
00:07:41,820 --> 00:07:43,880
She was told to buy various types.

180
00:07:43,880 --> 00:07:45,620
It's fine.

181
00:07:46,760 --> 00:07:49,360
And when she is done choosing...

182
00:07:51,580 --> 00:07:52,960
She dropped it.

183
00:07:52,960 --> 00:07:56,560
I'm so sorry.
But she isn't getting scolded by the shop attendants.

184
00:07:57,620 --> 00:07:59,480
I will hold it so please take.

185
00:07:59,480 --> 00:08:01,480
Thank you very much, young lady.

186
00:08:02,180 --> 00:08:04,500
Mama said to take 5.

187
00:08:04,500 --> 00:08:07,520
She is letting Kokona do it.

188
00:08:07,520 --> 00:08:10,340
One, two, three, fo-

189
00:08:10,340 --> 00:08:13,440
Kokona is so nervous because of her blunder.

190
00:08:13,440 --> 00:08:15,440
This one looks look.

191
00:08:17,440 --> 00:08:19,780
The shop attendant gives the dejected Kokona

192
00:08:19,780 --> 00:08:22,020
a pink balloon.

193
00:08:25,520 --> 00:08:26,860
Thank you.

194
00:08:26,860 --> 00:08:28,080
Thank you very much.

195
00:08:29,420 --> 00:08:31,100
She was so nervous.

196
00:08:31,580 --> 00:08:33,120
Hello.

197
00:08:33,120 --> 00:08:34,640
Please greet people.

198
00:08:34,640 --> 00:08:35,760
Hello.

199
00:08:35,760 --> 00:08:37,720
That's what she is told by her mother.

200
00:08:37,720 --> 00:08:39,100
Hello.

201
00:08:39,700 --> 00:08:40,980
I'm going shopping by myself.

202
00:08:40,980 --> 00:08:42,980
What? You are shopping by yourself?

203
00:08:42,420 --> 00:08:43,120
Yep.

204
00:08:43,120 --> 00:08:44,220
That's great.

205
00:08:44,220 --> 00:08:47,780
I was at the donut place and now I'm heading for the cake shop.

206
00:08:47,780 --> 00:08:50,140
- Is that so?
- Make sure you take care of yourself.

207
00:08:49,180 --> 00:08:50,900
- Yes. Bye bye.

208
00:08:50,100 --> 00:08:53,180
If you greet people they will be kind to you.

209
00:08:54,340 --> 00:08:56,500
Heading for the cake shop.

210
00:08:56,500 --> 00:09:00,060
Rather than the cake shop she is more concerned about what to buy from the grilled meat shop.

211
00:09:00,760 --> 00:09:04,340
Bang Bang chicken and Yakitori perchance.

212
00:09:04,040 --> 00:09:05,720
Not Yakitori, chicken Tsukune.

213
00:09:06,720 --> 00:09:08,180
Bang Bang chicken...

214
00:09:08,180 --> 00:09:10,180
And Tsukune perchance.

215
00:09:10,840 --> 00:09:12,300
I will do my very best...

216
00:09:14,220 --> 00:09:16,280
I'm starting to get confused.

217
00:09:18,860 --> 00:09:20,980
Bang Bang chicken

218
00:09:20,980 --> 00:09:21,780
Wait?

219
00:09:22,500 --> 00:09:24,500
This is a bus stop she's never seen before.

220
00:09:24,500 --> 00:09:27,280
While she's been saying Bang Bang she's left the trail.

221
00:09:28,760 --> 00:09:30,180
This is the worst.

222
00:09:30,180 --> 00:09:32,100
She's a lost child.

223
00:09:34,720 --> 00:09:36,400
And yet she keeps walking.

224
00:09:36,900 --> 00:09:39,580
Fried chicken...

225
00:09:39,580 --> 00:09:43,020
Bang Bang chicken Tsukune

226
00:09:43,020 --> 00:09:44,580
She remembered Tsukune.

227
00:09:45,180 --> 00:09:48,760
Bang Bang chicken Tsukune

228
00:09:48,980 --> 00:09:52,440
That's what it was. Bang Bang chicken and Tsukune.

229
00:09:52,440 --> 00:09:54,080
Where are you going?

230
00:09:54,280 --> 00:09:56,460
I'm going shopping by myself.

231
00:09:56,460 --> 00:09:58,680
- Shopping? Where to?
- Yep.

232
00:09:58,680 --> 00:10:00,100
The cake shop.

233
00:10:00,100 --> 00:10:02,100
Have you already shopped at the cake shop?

234
00:10:02,100 --> 00:10:04,620
- Not yet.
- Not yet?

235
00:10:04,620 --> 00:10:07,280
Pekochan Cake Shop was that way!

236
00:10:07,280 --> 00:10:09,280
She noticed.

237
00:10:10,100 --> 00:10:14,100
Where was it again?
It was that way!

238
00:10:14,100 --> 00:10:15,760
Yes, it's that way.

239
00:10:15,760 --> 00:10:19,160
This way. Peko. Ca-. Right?

240
00:10:26,560 --> 00:10:29,600
When coming here she always does the usual greeting.

241
00:10:29,860 --> 00:10:32,600
Shake shake shake. He-hello.

242
00:10:33,200 --> 00:10:36,360
She was asked to purchase a polar bear cake and carp streamer cookie.

243
00:10:37,260 --> 00:10:41,700
Polar bear cake, please.

244
00:10:41,700 --> 00:10:44,500
Mr. Best Friend Bear

245
00:10:42,440 --> 00:10:45,160
This one is for Kokona. And then...

246
00:10:45,160 --> 00:10:47,160
And a cookie for her little brother.

247
00:10:47,580 --> 00:10:50,720
Since today is a holiday, the box is Children's Day-themed.

248
00:10:50,720 --> 00:10:52,720
And this one, please.

249
00:10:52,720 --> 00:10:54,060
This too?

250
00:10:54,060 --> 00:10:58,360
Since they are going to grandpa's house, she was told to buy a carp streamer if they have them.

251
00:10:58,360 --> 00:11:00,960
Thankfully it isn't sold out.

252
00:11:01,340 --> 00:11:03,960
I bought it-*bounce*.

253
00:11:06,900 --> 00:11:12,260
Invigorated again, she is now heading for the grilled meat shop.

254
00:11:12,260 --> 00:11:13,940
I wonder if she will remember the song?

255
00:11:15,500 --> 00:11:18,400
Bang Bang chicken Tsukune.

256
00:11:18,400 --> 00:11:21,560
This is the shop she goes to with her family.

257
00:11:21,560 --> 00:11:23,540
I'm shopping by myself.

258
00:11:23,540 --> 00:11:25,100
- You came by yourself?
- Yeah.

259
00:11:25,100 --> 00:11:26,200
What do you want today?

260
00:11:26,200 --> 00:11:27,740
Yes, that song you've been singing.

261
00:11:28,180 --> 00:11:30,460
Bang Bang

262
00:11:30,460 --> 00:11:32,040
Bang Bang for one person.

263
00:11:32,040 --> 00:11:33,800
- Bang Bang meal.
- And...

264
00:11:34,820 --> 00:11:36,920
5 pieces of Kashira.

265
00:11:34,820 --> 00:11:36,920
TN: Kashira is from the tender part of the chicken breast.

266
00:11:36,920 --> 00:11:39,840
5 pieces of Kashira, 1 Bang Bang meal.

267
00:11:39,840 --> 00:11:40,920
And...

268
00:11:40,920 --> 00:11:43,000
The song became a mess.

269
00:11:43,000 --> 00:11:45,000
But she remembers when she ate it.

270
00:11:45,680 --> 00:11:47,860
Which one is round?

271
00:11:49,220 --> 00:11:51,280
It's like a Dango.

272
00:11:51,520 --> 00:11:53,100
Tsukene?

273
00:11:53,980 --> 00:11:55,000
Yes, 5 of those.

274
00:11:55,820 --> 00:11:57,020
Oh, you are shopping?

275
00:11:57,020 --> 00:11:59,020
- By myself.
- Hi, Hina.

276
00:11:59,360 --> 00:12:02,520
Hina, isn't it great that Kokona is shopping by herself?

277
00:12:02,520 --> 00:12:05,080
- Yep, all by myself.
- You came by yourself?

278
00:12:05,700 --> 00:12:08,000
- You can do that?
- Yes, of course I can.

279
00:12:08,000 --> 00:12:10,000
You are walking by yourself?

280
00:12:10,400 --> 00:12:12,000
No, I took the bus.

281
00:12:12,000 --> 00:12:13,480
Ah, Kokona...

282
00:12:13,480 --> 00:12:18,480
Since you came by yourself I will give you a Tsukune.

283
00:12:18,480 --> 00:12:19,940
I don't need one.

284
00:12:19,940 --> 00:12:21,220
Okay, I get it.

285
00:12:21,220 --> 00:12:22,760
What about the fried chicken?

286
00:12:22,760 --> 00:12:26,020
Inside mummy's tummy there is yet another baby.

287
00:12:26,020 --> 00:12:28,020
Yet another? I see.

288
00:12:28,640 --> 00:12:32,360
So that's why your mother isn't drinking alcohol.

289
00:12:34,020 --> 00:12:36,480
She's purchased Bang Bang, Tsukune and Kashira but...

290
00:12:36,480 --> 00:12:40,000
she forgot the first item in the song. Karaage.

291
00:12:41,180 --> 00:12:44,440
She's exhausted from carrying the purchased items.

292
00:12:45,300 --> 00:12:46,380
What? Beer!?

293
00:12:46,380 --> 00:12:48,380
No, no, no. It's juice, of course.

294
00:12:48,380 --> 00:12:49,360
You must be tired.

295
00:12:49,360 --> 00:12:51,600
It's not about being tired,

296
00:12:51,600 --> 00:12:54,360
it was exhausting, I tell ya.

297
00:12:55,400 --> 00:12:57,920
I'm sorry that it took me so long to come.

298
00:12:57,920 --> 00:13:00,160
It was quick, though.

299
00:13:00,160 --> 00:13:02,620
The truth is that it took some time.

300
00:13:02,620 --> 00:13:05,700
Can I complain a bit?

301
00:13:08,460 --> 00:13:10,780
Look, mama drew it for me.

302
00:13:10,780 --> 00:13:11,880
Why?

303
00:13:11,880 --> 00:13:14,220
She drew it so I can go shopping for Hinata and come back.

304
00:13:14,220 --> 00:13:15,840
I can see it.

305
00:13:15,840 --> 00:13:19,380
Hinata, Mama, Kokona.

306
00:13:19,380 --> 00:13:21,520
And the one in her tummy.

307
00:13:21,000 --> 00:13:23,140
I will become the eldest sister of them all.

308
00:13:24,700 --> 00:13:28,380
Customer, don't drink until dawn.
You still have shopping to do.

309
00:13:31,920 --> 00:13:33,400
Are they old geezers?

310
00:13:33,400 --> 00:13:34,380
Do your best, okay?

311
00:13:34,380 --> 00:13:36,380
- Yes.
- Remember to greet your mother from me.

312
00:13:36,380 --> 00:13:38,380
- Yes.
- Okay?
- Thank you.

313
00:13:38,600 --> 00:13:41,840
- Do your best.
- Yes.
- Do your best, okay?

314
00:13:42,380 --> 00:13:44,700
- Do your best.
- Yes.

315
00:13:48,680 --> 00:13:51,420
It's been 2 hours and 20 minutes since she left the house.

316
00:13:51,420 --> 00:13:53,560
It's the 5 o'clock bell.

317
00:13:51,420 --> 00:13:56,560
TN: It signals all over Japan that children should head home for dinner.

318
00:13:58,020 --> 00:14:08,220
At the ♩ bottom of ♪ the mountain ♪ what bell is ringing. 🎶

319
00:13:58,020 --> 00:14:08,220
TN: Loosely based on the song Kanenonaruoka.

320
00:14:18,400 --> 00:14:22,100
Grandpa and grandma's house is the mother's childhood home.

321
00:14:23,120 --> 00:14:26,860
The mother went ahead and is preparing for the celebration.

322
00:14:27,740 --> 00:14:31,640
The mother is making Inari Sushi in the style of carp streamers (koinobori).

323
00:14:31,640 --> 00:14:34,260
This mother can make all kinds of things.

324
00:14:38,540 --> 00:14:42,120
Kokona, you came!
You were able to do it by yourself?

325
00:14:42,120 --> 00:14:44,660
I bought carp streamers for Hinata.

326
00:14:45,160 --> 00:14:48,600
You thought it might be sold out but it was there.

327
00:14:49,060 --> 00:14:51,880
Was it scary? Or was it not scary at all?

328
00:14:51,880 --> 00:14:55,120
Mom...

329
00:14:55,160 --> 00:14:57,120
You were able to do it?

330
00:14:59,200 --> 00:15:02,480
Kokona was able to go shopping.

331
00:15:01,780 --> 00:15:04,760
Hinata, you sure have a fine sister.

332
00:15:03,980 --> 00:15:07,060
I thought that this one is cute so I bought it for Hinata.

333
00:15:09,740 --> 00:15:11,100
Great.

334
00:15:11,100 --> 00:15:13,720
Did you greet Pekochan today?

335
00:15:13,720 --> 00:15:14,760
Yes, I did.

336
00:15:14,760 --> 00:15:18,020
Look at this. Mum did her best and made this.

337
00:15:18,160 --> 00:15:20,000
What do you see?

338
00:15:20,000 --> 00:15:21,720
Can you see carp streamers?

339
00:15:21,720 --> 00:15:23,720
- I do.
- You can see it?

340
00:15:25,000 --> 00:15:26,800
Those are carp streamers.

341
00:15:29,240 --> 00:15:30,480
Amazing.

342
00:15:32,080 --> 00:15:34,640
- Mama, here.
- This is so great.

343
00:15:34,640 --> 00:15:36,700
What about Karaage?

344
00:15:36,700 --> 00:15:37,480
Did you say Karaage?

345
00:15:37,480 --> 00:15:39,400
- I forgot.
- You forgot!

346
00:15:39,400 --> 00:15:44,640
Nevermind. Let's eat next because you did your best.
It's okay, okay.

347
00:15:45,900 --> 00:15:49,620
- Today I did my best, cheers.
- Cheers.

348
00:15:51,860 --> 00:15:55,520
Getting praised by everyone. She did a lot today.

349
00:15:55,520 --> 00:15:57,400
How is it? How, how, how, how?

350
00:15:57,400 --> 00:16:00,500
Just wait, mama. I will praise you in a second.

351
00:16:03,320 --> 00:16:08,540
When you think of spring
all kinds of things seem so shiny.

352
00:16:03,820 --> 00:16:08,000
Moriguchi Hiroko
Singer

353
00:16:08,540 --> 00:16:14,260
And above all the shining smiles of children are unmatchable.

354
00:16:14,900 --> 00:16:20,700
Next up is a bald rebellious kid growing up on an orange orchard.

355
00:16:21,740 --> 00:16:23,720
Blue ocean, blue skies.

356
00:16:21,760 --> 00:16:26,300
Mizaki ● Nango

357
00:16:23,720 --> 00:16:28,160
The sunshine paradise, Miyazaki prefecture.
We've arrived at the city of Nango.

358
00:16:28,520 --> 00:16:31,840
The entire mountainside is all grandpa's orange orchard.

359
00:16:31,840 --> 00:16:35,620
During the harvest all the relatives help out.

360
00:16:35,620 --> 00:16:38,760
Taking in all the sun along with the oranges,

361
00:16:38,760 --> 00:16:45,040
there is a boy who also takes in a lot of sun and is brought up full of energy.

362
00:16:45,080 --> 00:16:49,640
Yuuta. 4 years and
3 months old.

363
00:16:46,320 --> 00:16:48,540
4 year old Yuuta.

364
00:16:48,920 --> 00:16:51,680
Getting the hang of things.

365
00:16:53,520 --> 00:16:55,420
Put it in mother's basket next.

366
00:16:54,500 --> 00:16:56,780
He's sneaking out of chores.

367
00:16:57,180 --> 00:16:58,600
Are you thirsty?

368
00:16:58,600 --> 00:17:00,820
- Tea.
- You haven't worked that much yet.

369
00:17:03,120 --> 00:17:05,960
Yuuta.

370
00:17:05,960 --> 00:17:09,020
He's been ignoring his mother lately.

371
00:17:09,480 --> 00:17:14,160
When it comes to picking oranges it's best to ask grandpa who knows everything about it.

372
00:17:14,260 --> 00:17:15,820
Yuuta.

373
00:17:15,820 --> 00:17:18,320
Please help your mother.

374
00:17:22,840 --> 00:17:26,040
Bringing up a child requires a fight.

375
00:17:32,460 --> 00:17:34,540
The mother will not lose.

376
00:17:36,540 --> 00:17:37,620
It's 10 already.

377
00:17:37,620 --> 00:17:39,260
Yes, it's 10.

378
00:17:39,260 --> 00:17:42,120
Now the errand is about to begin.

379
00:17:42,120 --> 00:17:44,120
- Yes, it's 10 now.
- Okay, let's go home.

380
00:17:44,120 --> 00:17:45,840
It's not time to go home yet.

381
00:17:45,840 --> 00:17:49,400
Let's go drink some tea and then

382
00:17:49,400 --> 00:17:52,900
you can go and make orange juice.

383
00:17:52,900 --> 00:17:54,220
By myself?

384
00:17:54,220 --> 00:17:55,760
Yes, by yourself.

385
00:17:55,440 --> 00:17:58,740
The errand entails heading home and making orange juice.

386
00:17:58,740 --> 00:18:01,340
Putting the oranges he harvested in the bag.

387
00:18:03,980 --> 00:18:06,100
- Remember to make orange juice.
- Yep.

388
00:18:06,100 --> 00:18:08,100
Go home by yourself and make it.

389
00:18:08,100 --> 00:18:10,100
Yes.

390
00:18:12,160 --> 00:18:15,540
For the mother who thinks that he never listens to her

391
00:18:15,540 --> 00:18:18,920
it's a bit unusual how fast he took off.

392
00:18:20,580 --> 00:18:21,780
He left.

393
00:18:21,780 --> 00:18:24,560
He does what he is told. When it comes to it.

394
00:18:25,800 --> 00:18:28,040
I'm so relieved.

395
00:18:28,040 --> 00:18:30,040
Will he come back again?

396
00:18:30,040 --> 00:18:34,040
Yep, he will be back. After finishing his errand.

397
00:18:34,680 --> 00:18:38,040
The mother trusts Yuuta.

398
00:18:38,040 --> 00:18:40,040
I'm so relieved.

399
00:18:42,040 --> 00:18:45,900
She's so overwhelmed by how well-behaved his response was.

400
00:18:45,900 --> 00:18:47,900
He listened to his mother.

401
00:18:47,900 --> 00:18:49,900
You are making me cry as well.

402
00:18:52,160 --> 00:18:53,860
Since this is my first time...

403
00:18:53,860 --> 00:18:55,600
I was a bit uneasy but...

404
00:18:55,600 --> 00:19:00,320
since he left he didn't need to look back even once so...

405
00:19:00,320 --> 00:19:02,320
so... so...

406
00:19:02,320 --> 00:19:04,900
I feel so lonely.

407
00:19:05,320 --> 00:19:08,220
It's too good to be true. I see.

408
00:19:08,220 --> 00:19:12,420
Once he is home there are games and and a TV.
No way he will be back.

409
00:19:13,800 --> 00:19:14,900
Home. ♪

410
00:19:14,900 --> 00:19:18,540
He's humming to himself while unlocking the door.

411
00:19:21,920 --> 00:19:22,960
Scribbles.

412
00:19:22,120 --> 00:19:25,120
They are all the work of Yuuta.

413
00:19:31,440 --> 00:19:34,560
We thought that he would start playing as soon as he got home.

414
00:19:34,560 --> 00:19:37,680
But these are the instruments for making orange juice.

415
00:19:38,120 --> 00:19:40,620
I'm sorry. I was talking nonsense.

416
00:19:40,620 --> 00:19:43,560
He came back to properly do his job.

417
00:19:43,860 --> 00:19:46,480
Things surely change when you become 4.

418
00:19:48,060 --> 00:19:50,620
What? Did you forget something?

419
00:19:52,840 --> 00:19:55,620
He's leaving for something.

420
00:19:58,100 --> 00:20:00,680
Hold up, that face.

421
00:20:03,280 --> 00:20:05,020
Just as I thought.

422
00:20:07,280 --> 00:20:09,380
He found a neighborhood friend.

423
00:20:10,340 --> 00:20:12,400
It's Maro!

424
00:20:15,440 --> 00:20:18,360
The play is escalating.

425
00:20:19,580 --> 00:20:21,320
Where did it go?

426
00:20:21,320 --> 00:20:24,660
What happened to coming back after pressing the juice?

427
00:20:27,240 --> 00:20:29,300
Seems like there will be none of that.

428
00:20:31,540 --> 00:20:32,780
Waiting for 40 minutes.

429
00:20:32,780 --> 00:20:34,520
Poor mom.

430
00:20:33,940 --> 00:20:35,920
He isn't back yet.

431
00:20:36,660 --> 00:20:39,040
It sure takes a long time.

432
00:20:40,540 --> 00:20:42,380
Let's take a break.

433
00:20:42,380 --> 00:20:44,380
He isn't very useful.

434
00:20:45,400 --> 00:20:47,640
I'm worried cause we don't know how he is.

435
00:20:47,640 --> 00:20:51,240
The only one who knows how he is is Maro.

436
00:20:55,360 --> 00:20:58,240
Close to an hour has passed.

437
00:20:58,240 --> 00:21:01,280
- He isn't pressing juice.
- He forgot all about it.

438
00:21:00,380 --> 00:21:02,840
He's back again.

439
00:21:02,840 --> 00:21:06,260
He's playing by himself. I wonder if he will press the juice.

440
00:21:09,180 --> 00:21:13,860
What!? You only came to take your hat?
Your mom is waiting. She is trusting you.

441
00:21:13,860 --> 00:21:15,560
And at that time...

442
00:21:17,660 --> 00:21:19,240
The phone is ringing.

443
00:21:21,600 --> 00:21:24,840
He loves to answer the phone.

444
00:21:26,520 --> 00:21:28,020
Hello.

445
00:21:28,020 --> 00:21:29,720
Yuuta, it's your mother.

446
00:21:29,720 --> 00:21:33,260
Yuuta, how is the juice coming along?

447
00:21:33,900 --> 00:21:36,220
Still.. It's already finished.

448
00:21:36,220 --> 00:21:38,840
Still... Finished??

449
00:21:38,840 --> 00:21:40,840
No way. Really?

450
00:21:40,840 --> 00:21:42,500
For real.

451
00:21:42,500 --> 00:21:44,280
Did you fill it up?

452
00:21:44,280 --> 00:21:46,180
It's full of juice.

453
00:21:46,180 --> 00:21:48,600
It's full? Hurry up and come back, Yuuta.

454
00:21:47,980 --> 00:21:49,600
He's lying.

455
00:21:48,600 --> 00:21:49,580
Yes.

456
00:21:49,580 --> 00:21:53,000
Come back with it. Everyone is waiting.

457
00:21:53,000 --> 00:21:55,500
- Yep.
- Hurry up and bring it with you.

458
00:21:55,640 --> 00:21:57,820
- Yes.
- Yes, I'm counting on you.

459
00:22:01,320 --> 00:22:03,220
The answer was good but...

460
00:22:03,220 --> 00:22:06,220
He said that he has made it.

461
00:22:06,220 --> 00:22:08,220
- He said he's made it?
- Yep.

462
00:22:08,220 --> 00:22:12,040
Since he said he's already made it he better hurry.

463
00:22:12,840 --> 00:22:15,560
Hey, you can't stand on the place where you eat food.

464
00:22:18,140 --> 00:22:19,480
It's onigiri.

465
00:22:18,520 --> 00:22:23,020
Mother has left it for lunch for when they get back.

466
00:22:24,100 --> 00:22:27,040
- Because he ran.
- Yeah, must be hungry.

467
00:22:28,400 --> 00:22:31,100
He started eating it.

468
00:22:31,100 --> 00:22:33,100
Something is different about it.

469
00:22:33,100 --> 00:22:35,240
Yuuta has noticed something.

470
00:22:36,220 --> 00:22:38,780
Yuuta who is afraid of ghosts.

471
00:22:38,780 --> 00:22:41,660
He's never been home alone before.

472
00:22:41,660 --> 00:22:44,420
- What's wrong?
- He's hiding in a cool place.

473
00:22:47,680 --> 00:22:51,260
Oh right! Mom can't yell at me.

474
00:22:54,160 --> 00:22:58,880
It seems he can break higher things as he gets taller.

475
00:22:58,440 --> 00:23:00,300
Amazing.

476
00:23:01,640 --> 00:23:04,460
What? He's taking the water gun.

477
00:23:04,460 --> 00:23:07,000
What about pressing the juice?

478
00:23:07,000 --> 00:23:10,060
Maro, you are in danger. Run away.

479
00:23:16,360 --> 00:23:19,060
Amazing timing.

480
00:23:19,520 --> 00:23:21,520
Perfect timing.

481
00:23:21,520 --> 00:23:24,520
It's as if his mother is watching him.

482
00:23:24,900 --> 00:23:25,900
What?

483
00:23:25,900 --> 00:23:27,900
Hello. Yuuta?

484
00:23:28,160 --> 00:23:29,800
This is your mother.

485
00:23:30,140 --> 00:23:33,280
Hurry up, press the juice and bring it.

486
00:23:33,280 --> 00:23:34,160
Yes.

487
00:23:34,160 --> 00:23:36,940
And what about your protection charm?

488
00:23:35,980 --> 00:23:37,960
The protection charm? It's there.

489
00:23:37,960 --> 00:23:39,780
Do you have it on you?

490
00:23:39,780 --> 00:23:40,620
Yes.

491
00:23:40,620 --> 00:23:43,880
Lies. I can see that you don't have it on.

492
00:23:43,880 --> 00:23:44,840
She can see?

493
00:23:44,840 --> 00:23:46,840
Be sure to wear it.

494
00:23:46,840 --> 00:23:48,240
Yes.

495
00:23:48,240 --> 00:23:50,240
Make sure you're wearing it.

496
00:23:54,600 --> 00:23:55,860
I'm wearing it.

497
00:23:55,860 --> 00:23:57,020
Are you wearing it?

498
00:23:57,020 --> 00:24:00,320
- I'm wearing it.
- You are? Then the orange juice.

499
00:24:00,320 --> 00:24:05,620
You haven't pressed the orange juice yet.
Make sure to do it properly.

500
00:24:06,260 --> 00:24:09,720
Make sure you press it and bring it.

501
00:24:09,720 --> 00:24:11,720
The way he's holding it.

502
00:24:11,720 --> 00:24:13,720
Hurry up. Make it and bring it. Jeez.

503
00:24:16,940 --> 00:24:17,740
What?

504
00:24:17,900 --> 00:24:19,040
He cut her off.

505
00:24:18,540 --> 00:24:19,960
He cut me off.

506
00:24:21,320 --> 00:24:25,720
The otherwise quiet house is now ringing with the scolding echo of the mother.

507
00:24:26,620 --> 00:24:28,400
Can't be helped. Let's do it.

508
00:24:29,400 --> 00:24:32,040
He usually is happy to help make the juice.

509
00:24:32,040 --> 00:24:34,920
That's why the mother has chosen this to be the errand.

510
00:24:35,200 --> 00:24:38,800
He's a child who doesn't do what he doesn't want to. But does the things he loves.

511
00:24:38,800 --> 00:24:40,800
Round and round and round.

512
00:24:40,800 --> 00:24:42,800
Round and round and round.

513
00:24:43,860 --> 00:24:46,460
He's even putting ice in there.

514
00:24:49,760 --> 00:24:52,000
Putting in the ice.

515
00:24:53,140 --> 00:24:56,380
The mother said to come back with a full container.

516
00:24:56,440 --> 00:24:58,380
It fills up easier because of the ice but...

517
00:24:58,380 --> 00:25:00,380
There's not enough for a full container.

518
00:25:01,420 --> 00:25:03,940
Yep, a couple drops of lemon juice.

519
00:25:04,880 --> 00:25:08,280
One cup of syrup.

520
00:25:10,100 --> 00:25:11,540
The taste is important.

521
00:25:11,540 --> 00:25:14,300
Hey, don't drink all of it.

522
00:25:20,380 --> 00:25:23,340
The volume is small but it's done.

523
00:25:27,780 --> 00:25:31,160
Starting at 10 o'clock, noon has passed now.

524
00:25:32,180 --> 00:25:34,920
I'm late. I'm late.

525
00:25:41,040 --> 00:25:42,480
He finally came.

526
00:25:46,000 --> 00:25:47,780
You brought it with you?

527
00:25:50,340 --> 00:25:53,000
Here you are.

528
00:25:53,540 --> 00:25:55,580
You did it.

529
00:25:55,580 --> 00:25:57,580
Yuuta, did you do it all by yourself?

530
00:25:57,260 --> 00:25:58,440
Yep.

531
00:25:58,840 --> 00:26:01,760
I'm so glad. Thank you, Yuuta.

532
00:26:02,780 --> 00:26:04,800
We were waiting. Grandpa and grandma too.

533
00:26:05,880 --> 00:26:08,380
Hurry up and let's drink some juice.

534
00:26:08,380 --> 00:26:11,320
- I brought everyone.
- You brought everyone?

535
00:26:10,340 --> 00:26:13,460
I wonder if there is enough for everyone.

536
00:26:17,740 --> 00:26:21,080
There's a sample for everyone. Freshly squeezed orange juice.

537
00:26:23,540 --> 00:26:27,000
- Cheers.
- Cheers.

538
00:26:27,000 --> 00:26:29,000
Thank you.

539
00:26:29,340 --> 00:26:33,400
The ice has melted just the right amount.

540
00:26:35,580 --> 00:26:36,680
It's delicious, Yuuta.

541
00:26:36,680 --> 00:26:38,680
I've become invigorated.

542
00:26:41,800 --> 00:26:45,500
They went from scolding him to praising him.

543
00:26:48,860 --> 00:26:53,080
Kagoshima    ●     Soo

544
00:26:49,080 --> 00:26:53,260
To an almost unbelievable extent we've managed to track down an errand genius.

545
00:26:53,800 --> 00:26:55,880
- Can you do it?
- Yes.

546
00:26:55,880 --> 00:26:57,880
He's still only 2 years and 9 months old.

547
00:26:56,240 --> 00:27:02,480
Hiroki
2 years
9 months old.

548
00:26:57,880 --> 00:27:00,640
Amazing. Will he manage it?

549
00:27:00,640 --> 00:27:02,320
And what if a car comes?

550
00:27:02,320 --> 00:27:03,800
- Like this.
- Yes, that's right.

551
00:27:03,800 --> 00:27:06,060
The answer is correct but...

552
00:27:06,060 --> 00:27:08,240
- OK? Go and come back.
- Yes.

553
00:27:08,240 --> 00:27:09,220
Bye bye.

554
00:27:08,240 --> 00:27:11,560
Just saying go and come back. Is that all?

555
00:27:11,560 --> 00:27:12,200
Bye bye.

556
00:27:12,200 --> 00:27:15,580
This kid can do it. These are the words
that the mothers believes in.

557
00:27:15,580 --> 00:27:19,060
Anyway, she let him wear his
pew-pew sound-making shoes.

558
00:27:19,060 --> 00:27:20,500
Bye bye.

559
00:27:22,580 --> 00:27:23,760
Bye bye.

560
00:27:23,760 --> 00:27:26,180
- Bye bye. Take care.
- Will do.

561
00:27:26,180 --> 00:27:28,180
I wonder if he will be fine.

562
00:27:28,180 --> 00:27:30,180
He found something.

563
00:27:31,700 --> 00:27:33,900
It's a long branch.

564
00:27:34,880 --> 00:27:36,840
I've arrived.

565
00:27:37,980 --> 00:27:42,080
Pardon me saying this, but it looks more like a baby pretending to fish than a child.

566
00:27:42,080 --> 00:27:44,080
Maybe I'll skip fishing and go home.

567
00:27:45,520 --> 00:27:47,200
An ambulance.

568
00:27:47,200 --> 00:27:50,400
An ambulance? No that's not right.

569
00:27:55,040 --> 00:27:56,380
An ambulance.

570
00:27:56,380 --> 00:27:58,380
He's not far off.

571
00:27:58,380 --> 00:27:59,500
Fire truck.

572
00:27:59,500 --> 00:28:01,400
That's not it, either.

573
00:28:02,220 --> 00:28:05,600
The brain of a 2 year old is looking for the right word.

574
00:28:05,600 --> 00:28:07,500
Police car.

575
00:28:07,500 --> 00:28:12,340
At that age it takes some time to find the right words.

576
00:28:14,320 --> 00:28:18,400
The bus that he loves is passing by but going the opposite way.

577
00:28:18,400 --> 00:28:19,640
It's a bus.

578
00:28:19,640 --> 00:28:21,640
His word finding skills are in top shape now.

579
00:28:23,580 --> 00:28:27,840
While sightseeing Hiroki has managed to walk a lot.

580
00:28:27,840 --> 00:28:30,480
Moreover, heading straight for the goal.

581
00:28:30,480 --> 00:28:34,300
Truth is, he's attempting an errand that's 1 km one-way.

582
00:28:34,300 --> 00:28:39,200
For someone who is 2 years and 9 months old the distance is quite overwhelming.

583
00:28:40,460 --> 00:28:45,680
TN: Satsuma-age is a fried fishcake from Kagoshima, Japan

584
00:28:40,460 --> 00:28:45,680
That's right, the things he was asked to get by his mother are
sweet curry and Bouten which is a kind of Satsuma-age.

585
00:28:45,680 --> 00:28:49,240
He was also asked to buy flowers to offer his grandma's house altar.

586
00:28:49,240 --> 00:28:52,240
Will he manage to remember all those things?

587
00:28:53,040 --> 00:28:56,260
It has taken 23 minutes for him to arrive at the supermarket.

588
00:28:56,260 --> 00:28:59,960
Which amounts to 2.6 kilometers. That's a great deal.

589
00:29:01,060 --> 00:29:02,680
The door opened but...

590
00:29:02,680 --> 00:29:05,040
it closes again.

591
00:29:04,000 --> 00:29:06,340
It's closing. It will close.

592
00:29:07,400 --> 00:29:10,300
Suddenly distracted.

593
00:29:11,280 --> 00:29:15,800
What was it I came here for? The gears in his head are grinding.

594
00:29:20,760 --> 00:29:23,180
Yes, he was able to make the connection.

595
00:29:23,180 --> 00:29:25,740
I'm here for an errand.
He runs!

596
00:29:31,720 --> 00:29:34,560
The 2 year 9 months old started running.

597
00:29:34,560 --> 00:29:36,560
This doesn't look like curry.

598
00:29:38,640 --> 00:29:40,660
He got the Bouten.

599
00:29:41,840 --> 00:29:43,580
I wonder if the currry is next?

600
00:29:43,580 --> 00:29:47,180
"Please give me the sweet kind."
Would be great if he asked as shop attendant.

601
00:29:48,820 --> 00:29:51,320
Where are the flowers?

602
00:29:51,320 --> 00:29:52,680
He's great!

603
00:29:52,060 --> 00:29:53,900
- Where are the flowers?
- The flowers?

604
00:29:53,940 --> 00:29:55,340
He talked!

605
00:29:55,340 --> 00:29:56,700
Follow me.

606
00:29:58,440 --> 00:30:00,600
Next up are the flowers, I see.

607
00:30:00,600 --> 00:30:05,400
Being able to ask for help properly
is an important thing.

608
00:30:07,380 --> 00:30:11,440
He always buys flowers for Buddha.

609
00:30:12,360 --> 00:30:16,400
The flowers he will offer his grandma are chrysanthemum.

610
00:30:18,240 --> 00:30:22,520
He now realizes that he's supposed to get a basket when shopping in the store.

611
00:30:23,680 --> 00:30:26,900
He isn't carrying so much that he needs a basket.

612
00:30:27,840 --> 00:30:29,260
Can you hold it?

613
00:30:29,260 --> 00:30:30,800
I can hold it.

614
00:30:30,800 --> 00:30:34,000
He want's to do it like he always does.

615
00:30:34,700 --> 00:30:36,060
Is that all?

616
00:30:36,060 --> 00:30:37,240
Yes.

617
00:30:37,240 --> 00:30:39,220
He hasn't purchased the curry yet.

618
00:30:39,220 --> 00:30:41,340
- Fine?
- Yep.
- Alright.

619
00:30:41,520 --> 00:30:43,920
587 yen, please.

620
00:30:43,920 --> 00:30:47,100
He's forgotten all about the sweet curry.

621
00:30:47,100 --> 00:30:49,100
With a 1000 yen bill.

622
00:30:49,100 --> 00:30:50,480
Putting it forward.

623
00:30:50,480 --> 00:30:51,900
Thank you for the 1000 yen.

624
00:30:53,260 --> 00:30:55,440
413 yen. Here you go.

625
00:30:55,440 --> 00:30:57,320
Is it okay? Can I put it directly into your bag?

626
00:30:57,320 --> 00:30:59,020
Hiroki will put it in.

627
00:30:59,020 --> 00:31:02,380
He's putting the change and the receipt in by himself.

628
00:31:06,100 --> 00:31:08,980
Yes. Thank you very much.

629
00:31:14,940 --> 00:31:18,280
What a splendid job. Well done.

630
00:31:18,580 --> 00:31:21,480
He forgot the curry but this will be enough.

631
00:31:21,480 --> 00:31:25,780
There is a long way back as well. Do you best.

632
00:31:27,160 --> 00:31:30,140
One more time. The curry.

633
00:31:30,140 --> 00:31:31,240
He remembered.

634
00:31:31,240 --> 00:31:32,880
I forgot the curry.

635
00:31:32,880 --> 00:31:34,880
It just clicked in his head.

636
00:31:39,180 --> 00:31:42,700
He knows the way to the curry mountain.

637
00:31:42,700 --> 00:31:44,700
He just passed it.

638
00:31:44,700 --> 00:31:46,700
What's wrong?

639
00:31:48,580 --> 00:31:52,640
Despite it being right here.
He has no clue after all.

640
00:31:53,400 --> 00:31:56,100
As I thought that he returns to it.

641
00:31:57,880 --> 00:32:02,600
There are all kinds.
Yes, yes, yes. The sweet one.

642
00:32:04,820 --> 00:32:09,320
The sweet one has the same color as Anpanman's nose.
That's what his mother told him.

643
00:32:09,460 --> 00:32:10,200
I see.

644
00:32:18,920 --> 00:32:23,620
He's bought it all and now it's time to return.

645
00:32:25,360 --> 00:32:27,780
The flowers are too long.

646
00:32:27,780 --> 00:32:29,780
The flower petals will drop.

647
00:32:31,500 --> 00:32:34,440
His nose is already dropping.

648
00:32:31,500 --> 00:32:38,440
TN: In Japanese flowers and nose are homonym and nose dropping means that snot is coming out. It's a play on words.

649
00:32:42,040 --> 00:32:44,200
Now it's time to cross the street.

650
00:32:44,200 --> 00:32:48,360
Now it's time to bring out the flag that his mother has made.

651
00:32:50,380 --> 00:32:51,960
That's so nice.

652
00:32:56,620 --> 00:33:00,600
Like magic, the cars stopped for him.

653
00:33:00,600 --> 00:33:03,600
Thanks to the expression of love from his mother.

654
00:33:02,220 --> 00:33:03,660
Such a great idea.

655
00:33:15,920 --> 00:33:17,680
Mother.

656
00:33:17,680 --> 00:33:18,920
Yes?

657
00:33:19,800 --> 00:33:23,720
Mother, I brought a lot.

658
00:33:23,720 --> 00:33:26,380
You brought it and came back.

659
00:33:27,020 --> 00:33:28,820
About the flowers...

660
00:33:28,820 --> 00:33:32,360
Judging by her reaction the flowers seem to be safe.

661
00:33:33,340 --> 00:33:35,480
First, hand over the receipt.

662
00:33:35,480 --> 00:33:38,620
Just like a real man.

663
00:33:38,620 --> 00:33:41,300
Let's show this to father.

664
00:33:41,960 --> 00:33:44,800
Hiroki, take care of it.

665
00:33:43,920 --> 00:33:44,940
Stand up.

666
00:33:44,940 --> 00:33:48,180
2 years 9 months old and his height is 86 centimeters.

667
00:33:49,200 --> 00:33:50,960
Up until there.

668
00:33:52,420 --> 00:33:57,360
Today they will offer new flowers to grandma.

669
00:34:00,200 --> 00:34:03,990
For the sweet curry they will add sweet Kagoshima Satsuma-age.

670
00:34:05,680 --> 00:34:09,620
Father too grew up on this. Just like how grandma made it.

671
00:34:09,620 --> 00:34:12,660
- Let's say it.
- Thank you for this meal.

672
00:34:14,020 --> 00:34:16,760
The father is eating a huge amount.

673
00:34:17,400 --> 00:34:18,700
Isn't it delicious?

674
00:34:19,800 --> 00:34:21,280
Isn't it good, Hiroki?

675
00:34:21,280 --> 00:34:24,920
I got it! I can buy curry if dad isn't feeling well.

676
00:34:29,100 --> 00:34:32,240
Next up we have someone going on an errand for their own birthday.

677
00:34:32,240 --> 00:34:35,860
Let's present a 4 year old girl.

678
00:34:36,360 --> 00:34:39,600
Aichi ● Okazaki

679
00:34:37,580 --> 00:34:40,520
The town of Okazaki where Tokugawa Ieyasu was born.

680
00:34:40,520 --> 00:34:48,990
Eight blocks (haccho) west from there lies Haccho Village, where Haccho Miso was created.

681
00:34:49,940 --> 00:34:57,960
Here in this duplex resides Maruya-san, a Miso factory which has continued to make Haccho Miso for the past 670 years.

682
00:34:57,960 --> 00:35:03,860
This errand is based upon visiting this traditional miso making village.

683
00:35:03,860 --> 00:35:08,580
Today there is yet another kid who will go on their first errand by themselves.

684
00:35:08,580 --> 00:35:09,800
I found it.

685
00:35:09,800 --> 00:35:11,780
Preparation for pork broth-making.

686
00:35:11,780 --> 00:35:13,780
I want to cut the carrots.

687
00:35:14,640 --> 00:35:17,760
Here is Rikako who will turn 4 today.

688
00:35:16,760 --> 00:35:23,160
Rikako.
4 years old.

689
00:35:17,760 --> 00:35:22,860
Overlooking all the children

690
00:35:19,760 --> 00:35:22,480
there is in fact another mother living in this house.

691
00:35:23,320 --> 00:35:24,700
And next is...

692
00:35:24,700 --> 00:35:26,860
To make pork broth, what else is needed?

693
00:35:26,860 --> 00:35:29,900
- Miso?
- Is there miso? Let's have a look.

694
00:35:29,900 --> 00:35:31,900
Here it comes.

695
00:35:31,900 --> 00:35:33,900
There's not enough miso.

696
00:35:34,480 --> 00:35:36,140
- It's true.
- What will you do?

697
00:35:36,920 --> 00:35:38,120
There is some. The pink stuff.

698
00:35:38,120 --> 00:35:38,820
What?

699
00:35:38,820 --> 00:35:40,820
That? That's not it.

700
00:35:41,640 --> 00:35:42,960
This is not good.

701
00:35:42,960 --> 00:35:46,000
The camera is hidden inside a miso box.

702
00:35:46,000 --> 00:35:49,440
This is miso for konjac.

703
00:35:49,420 --> 00:35:50,160
Good one.

704
00:35:50,160 --> 00:35:51,520
Can you go purchase miso?

705
00:35:51,520 --> 00:35:53,520
- Yep.
- I'm sorry to ask you this but...

706
00:35:53,520 --> 00:35:58,060
The miso we use at home is the golden standard red miso.

707
00:35:58,060 --> 00:36:02,920
Haccho miso uses natural fermentation and has a traditional taste.

708
00:36:02,920 --> 00:36:06,380
It takes longer to ferment and is much harder.

709
00:36:06,380 --> 00:36:08,680
The gold red miso that the mother asked for

710
00:36:08,680 --> 00:36:13,820
is easy to use even for the young ones who love haccho miso mixed with rice miso.

711
00:36:13,940 --> 00:36:17,420
- Gold?
- Tell them: "1 kilogram of gold, please."

712
00:36:17,620 --> 00:36:21,120
Did you get it?
If you look for the old man with the beard he will know.

713
00:36:21,120 --> 00:36:22,100
- Okay.
- Yep.

714
00:36:22,100 --> 00:36:31,500
TN: Tebasaki is fried chicken wings with a sweet and savory glaze.

715
00:36:22,640 --> 00:36:26,760
She was also requested to go get the Nagoya famous Tebasaki.

716
00:36:26,760 --> 00:36:29,500
Because there are many people at home she needs three boxes

717
00:36:29,500 --> 00:36:31,500
and golden red miso.

718
00:36:31,500 --> 00:36:36,840
Because she always goes with her mother Rikako will recognize the company owner.

719
00:36:36,840 --> 00:36:38,800
- He's so recognizable.
- Yeah, easy to remember.

720
00:36:38,440 --> 00:36:40,460
- I'm heading out.
- Please do.

721
00:36:40,460 --> 00:36:43,140
- Yes.
- Please use the umbrella properly.

722
00:36:44,860 --> 00:36:46,320
Don't mind. ♪

723
00:36:46,320 --> 00:36:49,400
Tonight there will be a party for Rikako who is turning 4.

724
00:36:51,840 --> 00:36:56,920
Rikako who is walking full of energy suddenly becomes drained from energy.

725
00:36:56,920 --> 00:36:58,920
The thing that has caught Rikako's eye is

726
00:36:58,920 --> 00:37:03,040
how close the river is from below the guard rail.

727
00:37:06,540 --> 00:37:10,560
She is always told that if you let your voice out then you will feel energized again.

728
00:37:10,560 --> 00:37:13,880
- Hello.
- Hello. What an amazing person.

729
00:37:13,880 --> 00:37:16,460
That made her full of energy again.

730
00:37:17,600 --> 00:37:18,680
Hello.

731
00:37:18,680 --> 00:37:22,540
Rikako who is going on her first errand
on her 4th birthday.

732
00:37:23,760 --> 00:37:28,100
She just arrived at the Nagoya famous Tebasaki shop.

733
00:37:28,740 --> 00:37:30,400
I wonder if it is open.

734
00:37:31,640 --> 00:37:34,040
The door opened but it says they are in the middle of preparation.

735
00:37:34,040 --> 00:37:35,520
Excuse me.

736
00:37:34,040 --> 00:37:36,980
Still preparing.

737
00:37:35,520 --> 00:37:36,980
Yes?

738
00:37:36,980 --> 00:37:40,020
I want 3.

739
00:37:40,020 --> 00:37:42,020
What? Mother? Did you come by yourself?

740
00:37:42,820 --> 00:37:45,160
- What about your mother?
- Mom is at home.

741
00:37:45,160 --> 00:37:46,680
- She isn't here? Really?
- Yep.

742
00:37:46,680 --> 00:37:49,380
Please give me 3 boxes.

743
00:37:49,380 --> 00:37:52,100
So 3 chicken wings of Tebasaki.

744
00:37:52,100 --> 00:37:54,100
You will bring 3 home again?

745
00:37:54,100 --> 00:37:56,520
Yes. I have money.

746
00:37:56,520 --> 00:37:58,100
- You do? Take it out.
- Yes.

747
00:37:58,100 --> 00:38:00,100
1312 yen, please.

748
00:38:00,100 --> 00:38:01,000
Okay.

749
00:38:01,000 --> 00:38:04,500
Just for the people who live nearby they sell at noon as an extra service.

750
00:38:04,500 --> 00:38:06,500
Yes, please wait a bit.

751
00:38:07,560 --> 00:38:10,340
Nagoya famous Tebasaki.

752
00:38:10,180 --> 00:38:12,380
Retaining the juiciness of the meat.

753
00:38:12,380 --> 00:38:14,380
They've just finished frying.

754
00:38:14,380 --> 00:38:17,980
Sprinkling them with salt and pepper
and you just can't resist it.

755
00:38:19,540 --> 00:38:21,100
Wait a little more, okay?

756
00:38:21,100 --> 00:38:23,100
I will make you some delicious ones.

757
00:38:25,080 --> 00:38:26,640
While you are waiting won't you try this?

758
00:38:26,640 --> 00:38:29,260
The way to eat them is with your hands.

759
00:38:29,260 --> 00:38:31,260
Take this one.

760
00:38:31,720 --> 00:38:33,300
I see.

761
00:38:33,300 --> 00:38:35,020
Please try and eat it.

762
00:38:35,020 --> 00:38:38,400
Show everyone at home
that this is how you hold and eat it.

763
00:38:38,400 --> 00:38:42,020
That's right. The meat is parting from the bone.

764
00:38:42,020 --> 00:38:45,140
What a polite child. Thank you.

765
00:38:49,240 --> 00:38:52,060
She arrives at the Maruya-san haccho miso factory.

766
00:38:52,800 --> 00:38:55,740
Different from usual she enters from the factory side entrance.

767
00:38:57,160 --> 00:38:59,840
Is there miso here?

768
00:38:59,840 --> 00:39:03,360
If you want miso then there is a mountains worth of it.

769
00:39:03,600 --> 00:39:06,300
She is entering along with the tour group.

770
00:39:10,560 --> 00:39:13,180
She's listening to the explanation with them.

771
00:39:12,160 --> 00:39:13,380
She's listening.

772
00:39:13,180 --> 00:39:16,480
The special thing about haccho miso is the low water amount after compressing it

773
00:39:13,380 --> 00:39:14,500
So cute.

774
00:39:16,480 --> 00:39:19,460
because of how hard we press, squeeze and drain it.

775
00:39:19,460 --> 00:39:22,340
Next up, let me show you around the way for miso creation.

776
00:39:23,480 --> 00:39:26,540
Next up, let me show you around the way for miso creation.

777
00:39:26,540 --> 00:39:29,720
I see. Haccho miso is amazing.

778
00:39:29,720 --> 00:39:33,020
I didn't know that they made this great miso close to our house.

779
00:39:33,020 --> 00:39:37,500
The weight of the rocks is about 4 tons and about 6 tons of miso is inside.

780
00:39:37,500 --> 00:39:40,760
If you were to purchase a bucket of this miso

781
00:39:40,760 --> 00:39:43,940
in a household of 4 people who will drink miso soup once every day

782
00:39:43,940 --> 00:39:46,300
it will take 205 years before you finish drinking it all.

783
00:39:46,300 --> 00:39:48,720
Wow, 205 years?

784
00:39:48,720 --> 00:39:50,720
Please proceed forward.

785
00:39:50,720 --> 00:39:52,720
What? What's ahead?

786
00:39:53,660 --> 00:39:57,160
What is this? What's inside?

787
00:40:00,200 --> 00:40:03,380
An unknown old lady helps her see inside.

788
00:40:07,980 --> 00:40:10,820
What's up with that? There's nothing in there.

789
00:40:10,820 --> 00:40:12,820
Welcome.

790
00:40:14,440 --> 00:40:19,160
She comes to buy with mom all the time, but she just watched.

791
00:40:19,160 --> 00:40:22,820
That was fun. Alright, I've decided.

792
00:40:22,820 --> 00:40:25,840
She's heading for the office where they usually purchase from.

793
00:40:25,840 --> 00:40:29,380
I wonder if the company owner is there.

794
00:40:29,380 --> 00:40:32,520
Today is so slippery.

795
00:40:32,520 --> 00:40:34,420
Because I came by myself.

796
00:40:34,420 --> 00:40:36,520
It's the first time she has come by herself.

797
00:40:37,980 --> 00:40:40,100
It's not an automatic door.

798
00:40:40,100 --> 00:40:42,680
Make sure to close it properly.

799
00:40:46,020 --> 00:40:51,900
Excuse me. 1 kilogram of miso please.

800
00:40:51,780 --> 00:40:53,300
1 kilo of miso?

801
00:40:53,300 --> 00:40:53,800
Yep.

802
00:40:53,800 --> 00:40:57,100
- What kind of miso would you like?
- Haccho miso.

803
00:40:57,100 --> 00:40:59,100
What? Haccho miso!?

804
00:40:59,100 --> 00:41:04,740
Though she was told to purchase Akadashi she must've been inspired by all the talk about haccho miso.

805
00:41:04,740 --> 00:41:10,140
You have 1200 yen and that's not enough.
I will give you the rest as a present, ok?

806
00:41:10,140 --> 00:41:12,140
Golden red miso is only 1000 yen.

807
00:41:12,140 --> 00:41:14,340
Haccho miso is a bit expensive.

808
00:41:14,340 --> 00:41:16,780
She has to put on a hat since they are going into the factory.

809
00:41:16,780 --> 00:41:19,480
Rinako, did you come by yourself?

810
00:41:19,480 --> 00:41:20,780
That's so great of you.

811
00:41:20,780 --> 00:41:25,020
Today is. Since it's Rikako's birthday.

812
00:41:25,020 --> 00:41:27,020
How old will you be?

813
00:41:27,020 --> 00:41:29,020
- 4 years old.
- 4 years old? That's amazing.

814
00:41:30,500 --> 00:41:32,260
So that's why you came to purchase miso?

815
00:41:32,260 --> 00:41:34,260
That's amazing.

816
00:41:34,700 --> 00:41:38,060
Haccho miso, I wonder what kind of
amazing taste it has.

817
00:41:39,040 --> 00:41:42,380
She is licking the miso.

818
00:41:43,380 --> 00:41:45,860
Lifting the lid for the haccho miso.

819
00:41:45,860 --> 00:41:47,860
It's really hard miso, right?

820
00:41:47,860 --> 00:41:50,420
So this is real haccho miso.

821
00:41:51,200 --> 00:41:52,860
There's so much miso.

822
00:41:52,860 --> 00:41:54,740
- A lot?
- Yep.

823
00:41:54,740 --> 00:42:00,420
It's different from usual.
After hearing the explanation she really wants to dig into it.

824
00:42:02,140 --> 00:42:04,360
Yes, we've gathered 1 kilogram.

825
00:42:06,320 --> 00:42:11,400
Since it is your birthday I want to show you what's inside. Do you want to see?

826
00:42:11,400 --> 00:42:13,920
The very special service from the company owner.

827
00:42:15,660 --> 00:42:19,160
They've entered a place that is outside of the tour route.

828
00:42:21,480 --> 00:42:23,120
There is miso inside of those.

829
00:42:23,120 --> 00:42:25,120
There are stones on top.

830
00:42:25,420 --> 00:42:29,140
Is there miso where the stones are place upon?

831
00:42:29,140 --> 00:42:31,740
Yes, inside of there you will find miso.

832
00:42:32,080 --> 00:42:35,640
Is it made from stones?

833
00:42:35,880 --> 00:42:38,080
So those are edible stones?

834
00:42:38,080 --> 00:42:40,080
You can't eat them. Since they are stones.

835
00:42:40,680 --> 00:42:45,200
Rikako, I want to give you a birthday present.

836
00:42:45,200 --> 00:42:47,200
It's small but...

837
00:42:47,200 --> 00:42:48,560
Do you know this?

838
00:42:48,560 --> 00:42:49,620
Are those stones?

839
00:42:49,620 --> 00:42:52,060
Yes, those are stones. This is wood.

840
00:42:52,060 --> 00:42:54,760
Have a look. It's the same thing.

841
00:42:54,760 --> 00:42:57,620
It's the same thing.

842
00:42:57,620 --> 00:42:59,920
It's your birthday present.

843
00:42:59,920 --> 00:43:01,760
I want to see over there.

844
00:43:01,760 --> 00:43:04,220
Her curiosity switch has been turned on.

845
00:43:04,220 --> 00:43:07,220
The type of stone that is placed above the huge bucket.

846
00:43:06,780 --> 00:43:09,040
I can carry it.

847
00:43:09,040 --> 00:43:10,360
Can you, Rikako?

848
00:43:10,360 --> 00:43:12,360
What?

849
00:43:13,680 --> 00:43:16,080
Do you want to try and taste some miso?

850
00:43:15,100 --> 00:43:18,100
It's a sample.

851
00:43:18,100 --> 00:43:22,960
This is the same as the one you are bringing home today.

852
00:43:22,960 --> 00:43:28,680
Haccho miso. For the mother it's a bit too bitter but it has a nice traditional taste.

853
00:43:29,820 --> 00:43:31,700
- Delicious.
- Is it delicious?

854
00:43:31,700 --> 00:43:33,180
That's right.

855
00:43:33,180 --> 00:43:34,780
What is this?

856
00:43:34,780 --> 00:43:34,780
This is red miso...

857
00:43:34,780 --> 00:43:38,020
This is red miso...

858
00:43:37,320 --> 00:43:38,640
It's the name of the requested thing.

859
00:43:38,640 --> 00:43:41,300
- I want to eat it.
- You want to eat it? Okay.

860
00:43:44,480 --> 00:43:47,140
- It's delicious.
- Is it? There's also dengaku miso.

861
00:43:44,480 --> 00:43:47,140
TN: Dengaku miso is good for glazing  vegetables and using in oden.

862
00:43:47,700 --> 00:43:52,000
The last one she gets to try on her observation trip is dengaku.

863
00:43:57,780 --> 00:43:59,620
Is it hot?

864
00:44:02,000 --> 00:44:04,560
Is it delicious?

865
00:44:04,560 --> 00:44:06,780
Alright. Let's go.

866
00:44:06,780 --> 00:44:09,280
Thank you very much to the busy company owner.

867
00:44:09,280 --> 00:44:12,620
I want to eat miso once again.

868
00:44:12,620 --> 00:44:15,080
You wan't to eat once again before going home?

869
00:44:14,080 --> 00:44:15,940
I beg your pardon.

870
00:44:15,940 --> 00:44:19,120
She has now sampled all of the miso.

871
00:44:22,360 --> 00:44:24,020
I'm heading home.

872
00:44:25,200 --> 00:44:27,200
- Will you come back again?
- Yeah.

873
00:44:27,200 --> 00:44:30,900
- Take care of yourself.
- Yep. Bye bye. Yes.

874
00:44:30,560 --> 00:44:36,920
For Rikako the taste of haccho miso remains.

875
00:44:37,500 --> 00:44:40,580
The taste she remembers. The taste of her home town.

876
00:44:48,860 --> 00:44:50,380
Obeying the sign.

877
00:44:50,380 --> 00:44:52,380
She will soon be back home.

878
00:44:57,740 --> 00:44:59,920
I purchased it all.

879
00:44:59,920 --> 00:45:01,920
You purchased it?

880
00:45:02,380 --> 00:45:04,400
I even bought the chicken dish.

881
00:45:04,400 --> 00:45:08,080
Tha- what!? You bought!?

882
00:45:08,080 --> 00:45:10,080
Even miso.

883
00:45:10,080 --> 00:45:12,080
Is it heavy?

884
00:45:12,080 --> 00:45:14,800
Welcome home. Come here.

885
00:45:15,200 --> 00:45:19,060
- Aaah, it was so heavy.
- Was it heavy?

886
00:45:21,260 --> 00:45:24,680
I went to the company owner's place and...

887
00:45:24,680 --> 00:45:27,020
I'm totally worn out.

888
00:45:28,360 --> 00:45:31,740
Thank you so much.
You've helped me out.

889
00:45:31,740 --> 00:45:33,480
What is this?

890
00:45:33,480 --> 00:45:35,340
I mistakenly said haccho miso.

891
00:45:35,340 --> 00:45:36,840
You mistakenly said haccho miso?

892
00:45:36,840 --> 00:45:37,760
Is it alright?

893
00:45:37,760 --> 00:45:39,500
I told you gold.

894
00:45:39,500 --> 00:45:42,800
I remembered but haccho miso is alright.

895
00:45:44,240 --> 00:45:46,000
It's delicious.

896
00:45:46,000 --> 00:45:47,480
It's delicious, isn't it?

897
00:45:50,720 --> 00:45:52,660
- It's delicious, right?
- Right.

898
00:45:52,320 --> 00:45:53,680
She's so cute.

899
00:45:53,680 --> 00:45:55,160
What's this?

900
00:45:55,160 --> 00:45:56,600
The house of miso.

901
00:45:56,600 --> 00:45:58,000
Oh, so it's the house of miso.

902
00:45:58,000 --> 00:45:59,420
I see. It's the house of miso.

903
00:45:59,420 --> 00:46:02,400
Inside of this there is miso.

904
00:46:02,400 --> 00:46:03,660
Oh, so the miso is inside.

905
00:46:03,100 --> 00:46:05,080
She understands it properly.

906
00:46:05,060 --> 00:46:06,560
Stones.

907
00:46:07,320 --> 00:46:09,860
Everyone has gathered for the 4 year old's party.

908
00:46:09,860 --> 00:46:13,500
Happy birthday dear Rikako. ♪

909
00:46:13,500 --> 00:46:16,600
Happy birthday to you. ♪

910
00:46:24,720 --> 00:46:28,180
Congratulations!

911
00:46:28,180 --> 00:46:30,640
It's pork broth with haccho miso.

912
00:46:30,640 --> 00:46:33,420
This is the miso that I bought.

913
00:46:34,640 --> 00:46:36,240
- Delicious.
- It's delicious.

914
00:46:36,240 --> 00:46:38,240
Isn't it different from usual?

915
00:46:38,240 --> 00:46:40,240
Haccho miso.

916
00:46:40,240 --> 00:46:43,120
- You bought haccho miso?
- This is haccho miso?

917
00:46:43,120 --> 00:46:46,140
The kid who loves the tebasaki.

918
00:46:47,760 --> 00:46:50,140
Higa, you are wrong.

919
00:46:50,140 --> 00:46:52,140
About this thing, you see?

920
00:46:52,860 --> 00:46:57,100
Without grasping it with chopsticks, you just hold it and eat it.

921
00:46:57,100 --> 00:46:59,100
She learned it properly.

922
00:46:59,700 --> 00:47:02,200
If you don't know then let me teach do it for you.

923
00:47:04,180 --> 00:47:05,720
Here?

924
00:47:05,720 --> 00:47:09,380
I will do it for you. Even for Macchan.

925
00:47:09,380 --> 00:47:11,140
Ah, it came out. Is that it?

926
00:47:11,140 --> 00:47:12,740
That's it.

927
00:47:12,740 --> 00:47:14,740
Will you eat Rikako?

928
00:47:14,740 --> 00:47:16,740
Go ahead and eat.

929
00:47:18,620 --> 00:47:20,920
What a great ending.

930
00:47:24,500 --> 00:47:29,140
Seeing the smiles of children and becoming energized.
It surely is a great thing.

931
00:47:29,140 --> 00:47:31,540
The staff is gathering all their energy.

932
00:47:31,540 --> 00:47:36,120
For the June 18th broadcast aimed at Ocean Day.

933
00:47:36,120 --> 00:47:39,400
Let's look forward to the "Summer Big Adventure Special".
