1
00:04:34,620 --> 00:04:37,220
Tanaka vs Kojima Yoshio.

2
00:04:37,460 --> 00:04:39,060
So everybody!

3
00:04:39,060 --> 00:04:40,930
So, the first battle will begin now.

4
00:04:40,930 --> 00:04:43,760
Don't lose Tanaka!

5
00:04:44,800 --> 00:04:45,930
Are you ready?

6
00:04:45,930 --> 00:04:46,630
Yes!

7
00:04:46,630 --> 00:04:48,630
So let's start.

8
00:04:48,630 --> 00:04:51,370
First match! Start!

9
00:04:56,740 --> 00:04:57,940
Ohh good!

10
00:04:57,940 --> 00:04:59,510
Do variations!

11
00:05:04,150 --> 00:05:06,580
Good! Good! OK! OK!

12
00:05:08,250 --> 00:05:10,260
Don't lose!

13
00:05:10,390 --> 00:05:12,390
Expression! Expression!

14
00:05:13,960 --> 00:05:15,830
Your face too! Your face!

15
00:05:18,060 --> 00:05:19,300
Excuse me!

16
00:05:20,370 --> 00:05:22,370
Excuse me, let me pass!

17
00:05:22,400 --> 00:05:23,600
Excuse, give way!

18
00:05:24,700 --> 00:05:26,370
Ahh! Good! Good!

19
00:05:27,810 --> 00:05:29,770
Half time passed!

20
00:05:33,710 --> 00:05:35,510
Tanaka!!

21
00:05:35,550 --> 00:05:37,720
You keep doing the same damn thing!!

22
00:05:42,890 --> 00:05:45,420
Show us your youth!

23
00:05:45,520 --> 00:05:47,530
Last 10 secs!

24
00:05:51,500 --> 00:05:53,500
Last spurt!

25
00:05:57,100 --> 00:06:00,610
Finish!!

26
00:06:06,310 --> 00:06:08,250
Tanaka's showed us his moves.

27
00:06:08,250 --> 00:06:10,480
That base movement was Noh right?

28
00:06:10,480 --> 00:06:12,880
That right?

29
00:06:16,550 --> 00:06:20,060
A move that seems like collecting something by Tanaka.
However..

30
00:06:20,260 --> 00:06:22,190
The score, please!

31
00:06:22,190 --> 00:06:24,200
Please!

32
00:06:26,000 --> 00:06:29,800
Kojima Yoshio wins.

3 votes agains 0.
10 points to !Team Junk!.

34
00:06:38,340 --> 00:06:43,150
There was only a few variations in the moves...

35
00:06:43,580 --> 00:06:44,980
It was the same moves only.

36
00:06:44,980 --> 00:06:47,950
I'm saying this only after it ended,
but they were not good at all.

37
00:06:48,090 --> 00:06:49,450
He got disqualified right?

38
00:06:49,450 --> 00:06:53,790
They wanted more expressions.
Kojima did this well.

39
00:06:54,460 --> 00:06:55,760
I did, yes.

40
00:06:55,760 --> 00:06:57,760
And he's totally standing.

41
00:06:58,430 --> 00:07:01,000
What's the matter Tanaka?
We still have the team competition.

42
00:07:01,000 --> 00:07:02,700
Can you give me a hand?

43
00:07:02,700 --> 00:07:04,070
- Seriously!?
- You can't stand up!?

44
00:07:09,610 --> 00:07:14,280
Till the utmost keep moving. Unstoppable moves.
Must see! That man's breakdown!?

45
00:07:16,580 --> 00:07:18,620
Team Gaki lost the first match.

46
00:07:18,720 --> 00:07:21,850
The next match is Housei vs Sagane!

47
00:07:22,050 --> 00:07:23,520
Tell me! Tell me everything!

48
00:07:23,590 --> 00:07:26,320
Even the seconds. The seconds.
Also, say things like "raise your hands", etc.

49
00:07:26,320 --> 00:07:27,330
Yes, yes. We will say.

50
00:07:27,330 --> 00:07:28,360
Listen carefully.

51
00:07:28,360 --> 00:07:30,430
Unstoppable moves, next match!

52
00:07:31,030 --> 00:07:32,530
Start!!

53
00:07:46,180 --> 00:07:48,180
Go lower, go lower!

54
00:07:50,220 --> 00:07:51,880
That's good!

55
00:07:52,580 --> 00:07:54,020
I wanna see the back!

56
00:07:54,020 --> 00:07:56,020
Lower is good!

57
00:07:56,720 --> 00:07:58,720
I wanna see the back!

58
00:08:05,400 --> 00:08:06,800
Hlaf min left.

59
00:08:10,870 --> 00:08:12,340
Use sound as well!

60
00:08:14,340 --> 00:08:16,570
Sagane use the rope as well!

61
00:08:18,580 --> 00:08:19,640
Rope! Rope!

62
00:08:23,080 --> 00:08:23,950
Use the rope!

63
00:08:26,420 --> 00:08:27,120
Rope! Rope!

64
00:08:28,690 --> 00:08:29,850
10 secs left!

65
00:08:31,290 --> 00:08:33,220
Let's use the 3 secs! The 3 secs!

66
00:08:34,660 --> 00:08:35,760
They are not moving at all!

67
00:08:37,130 --> 00:08:39,130
Finish!!

68
00:08:41,200 --> 00:08:42,470
What was that?

69
00:08:42,470 --> 00:08:44,170
That was terrible.

70
00:08:44,170 --> 00:08:46,300
You kept doing only this.

71
00:08:46,870 --> 00:08:48,870
The second half was terrible.

72
00:08:49,970 --> 00:08:53,040
Only the woaahh! In the beginning was good.

73
00:08:53,040 --> 00:08:55,050
The "rocket" in the beginning was good.
Here he goes! I thought, but...

74
00:08:58,420 --> 00:09:03,150
With only the vigor at the beginning.
The rest was a waste of Housei. However.

75
00:09:03,350 --> 00:09:05,320
The score! Go!

76
00:09:10,090 --> 00:09:13,930
Sagane wins.

77
00:09:14,570 --> 00:09:16,900
- I thought you would lose.
- You though he would lose?

78
00:09:16,940 --> 00:09:19,800
I though because he wasn't following
our instructions at all!

79
00:09:19,870 --> 00:09:22,570
Honestly, the second half
was not funny at all!

80
00:09:23,810 --> 00:09:25,410
He won't move.

81
00:09:25,410 --> 00:09:27,750
Senpai!

82
00:09:27,750 --> 00:09:29,750
We still have the team competition.

83
00:09:29,750 --> 00:09:31,350
Senpai!

84
00:09:31,720 --> 00:09:33,180
Give me a hand...

85
00:09:33,480 --> 00:09:35,650
One minute ago he was like "I'm the best!".

86
00:09:36,960 --> 00:09:40,930
So now is the third match! The center fielders!

87
00:09:41,430 --> 00:09:43,930
Gaki team with 2 consecutive losses
have to win now.

88
00:09:44,430 --> 00:09:47,400
Strategy Time

89
00:09:44,430 --> 00:09:47,400
The next who will come out now is...

90
00:09:48,000 --> 00:09:51,570
- We have to seize the opponent..
- My variations are quite powerful..

91
00:09:51,570 --> 00:09:52,140
Wait a sec.

92
00:09:52,140 --> 00:09:54,310
You are bothering us Housei!

93
00:09:54,310 --> 00:09:56,470
- We are making arrangements!
- Go somewhere else!

94
00:09:56,470 --> 00:09:58,510
- Go there!
- Good for nothing...

95
00:09:59,110 --> 00:10:01,110
He accomplished nothing till now.

96
00:10:02,150 --> 00:10:05,420
The third match is Matsumoto vs Uchima.

97
00:10:05,620 --> 00:10:07,850
Can he show the spirit of a regular member?

98
00:10:08,220 --> 00:10:10,360
I definitely don't wanna lose agains Uchima!

99
00:10:11,320 --> 00:10:13,460
I'll go all out.
So keep an eye on my variations!

100
00:10:13,560 --> 00:10:16,230
Because my variations are so sick!! OK?

101
00:10:16,360 --> 00:10:18,000
So! Are you ready?

102
00:10:19,800 --> 00:10:21,800
Unstoppable moves. Main match.

103
00:10:22,030 --> 00:10:22,970
On your mark!

104
00:10:23,370 --> 00:10:24,470
Start!!

105
00:10:32,210 --> 00:10:33,280
Keep it up!

106
00:10:33,880 --> 00:10:34,880
Keep it up!

107
00:10:38,280 --> 00:10:39,350
Good! Good! Go! Go!

108
00:10:42,320 --> 00:10:43,390
Good Uchima!

109
00:10:45,120 --> 00:10:46,520
Step in! Step in!

110
00:10:56,370 --> 00:10:57,570
Reach the voice!

111
00:10:57,840 --> 00:10:59,000
Move more, more!

112
00:11:01,440 --> 00:11:03,640
There! We have variation!

113
00:11:04,480 --> 00:11:06,480
We have variation!

114
00:11:09,710 --> 00:11:11,380
Good! This move is good!

115
00:11:12,250 --> 00:11:13,480
It's ok! It's ok!

116
00:11:18,620 --> 00:11:21,090
Voice! The voice!

117
00:11:32,370 --> 00:11:33,470
We got it!

118
00:11:33,470 --> 00:11:36,370
Tanaka was joining together with Matsumoto!

119
00:11:36,810 --> 00:11:38,780
Started with co-acting and finished with co-acting.

120
00:11:38,780 --> 00:11:41,650
Also, what was that?

121
00:11:42,750 --> 00:11:44,850
- Ahh this match we cannot know who won.
- It was a good match.

122
00:11:44,850 --> 00:11:47,950
So let's see how they will judge.
The score..

123
00:11:48,250 --> 00:11:49,590
Please!

124
00:11:50,660 --> 00:11:51,560
Come, come.

125
00:11:53,390 --> 00:11:56,190
Matsumoto wins.

126
00:11:56,190 --> 00:12:00,970
3 votes against 0.
10 points to Team Gaki!

127
00:12:02,930 --> 00:12:04,670
According to our plans right?

128
00:12:05,000 --> 00:12:07,910
What was sometimes that move you did?

129
00:12:08,940 --> 00:12:10,010
That was not moving impression.

130
00:12:10,040 --> 00:12:10,810
You stopped there, didn't you?

131
00:12:10,840 --> 00:12:12,310
It's because on the first time..

132
00:12:12,340 --> 00:12:13,580
..I nailed it.

133
00:12:15,380 --> 00:12:17,250
I nailed on the first time.

134
00:12:17,720 --> 00:12:18,850
That's true.

135
00:12:19,280 --> 00:12:22,190
Wanting to continue the momentum of
Matsumoto's win, Team Gaki..

136
00:12:22,450 --> 00:12:25,220
Forth match Endo vs Shouji.

137
00:12:25,790 --> 00:12:29,160
Well, the relation between Endo and Shouji..
In private too right?

138
00:12:29,290 --> 00:12:31,230
They have this friendly relationship.

139
00:12:31,230 --> 00:12:33,460
But there's a high possibility that
one's moves will cover another.

140
00:12:35,600 --> 00:12:37,940
At this point, I don't know what they are saying..

141
00:12:38,140 --> 00:12:39,470
They are saying something aren't they?

142
00:12:39,800 --> 00:12:42,040
On your mark!

143
00:12:42,340 --> 00:12:43,880
Start!!

144
00:12:44,180 --> 00:12:46,180
We're counting on you!

145
00:12:48,150 --> 00:12:48,810
Go!

146
00:12:48,810 --> 00:12:50,780
Variation! Ohh good!

147
00:12:52,080 --> 00:12:54,050
Good! Good!

148
00:12:54,790 --> 00:12:55,890
He's moving! He's moving!

149
00:12:55,890 --> 00:12:56,590
Nice move!

150
00:13:00,390 --> 00:13:01,430
Very much Endo like.

151
00:13:01,560 --> 00:13:02,990
Good! Good!

152
00:13:06,230 --> 00:13:07,170
Crat a opening!

153
00:13:15,070 --> 00:13:15,610
Good! Good!

154
00:13:18,680 --> 00:13:20,410
Once he uses that, he won't stop.

155
00:13:21,510 --> 00:13:22,410
Let's change now!

156
00:13:22,410 --> 00:13:24,350
It's almost 10 secs!

157
00:13:24,980 --> 00:13:26,950
10 secs left!

158
00:13:28,650 --> 00:13:29,720
What is he doing?

159
00:13:30,220 --> 00:13:31,120
Left!

160
00:13:32,790 --> 00:13:35,090
All the same thing!

161
00:13:35,730 --> 00:13:37,530
Finish!!

162
00:13:37,530 --> 00:13:39,500
Wait Endo! Hey!

163
00:13:41,830 --> 00:13:43,130
All the moves were the same.

164
00:13:43,130 --> 00:13:45,370
So let's see the judges.

165
00:13:45,370 --> 00:13:47,410
The score! Please!

166
00:13:51,140 --> 00:13:52,410
Endo wins!

167
00:13:52,510 --> 00:13:55,650
That move made the difference. That diving.

168
00:13:56,180 --> 00:13:57,350
You were amazing!

169
00:13:58,280 --> 00:13:59,250
What's that..

170
00:14:01,550 --> 00:14:04,460
Well it's incredible how they can reconciliate.

171
00:14:04,460 --> 00:14:05,620
- Ah that's true.
- Incredible.

172
00:14:07,860 --> 00:14:11,300
Upcoming, the final match. Hamada vs Nishimura!!

173
00:14:13,060 --> 00:14:16,500
At the moment, both sides still fighting. A tie.

174
00:14:18,340 --> 00:14:22,870
Fighting in the final match Hamada vs Nishimura.

175
00:14:23,570 --> 00:14:24,810
which move is the best...

176
00:14:24,810 --> 00:14:26,280
But you can have anticipations, can't you?

177
00:14:26,280 --> 00:14:30,350
I know, I'm just thinking what kind of move
will make a difference in the points.

178
00:14:30,480 --> 00:14:32,680
- Ah..this is will be..
- Show it to us!

179
00:14:32,950 --> 00:14:35,090
Nishimura also is not that bad.

180
00:14:35,290 --> 00:14:36,820
Looks like he just woke up.

181
00:14:37,420 --> 00:14:38,890
Oh! What is that?

182
00:14:39,120 --> 00:14:40,520
It already started?

183
00:14:40,730 --> 00:14:42,260
You're doing good leader! Keep it up!

184
00:14:42,360 --> 00:14:43,960
So let's begin!

185
00:14:44,000 --> 00:14:44,430
On your marks.

186
