00:00:02,610 --> 00:00:06,310
Welcome to Wednesday Downtown

2
00:00:07,360 --> 00:00:10,360
Let's get on with our first presenter please

3
00:00:15,420 --> 00:00:18,240
Welcome to Oda

4
00:00:18,240 --> 00:00:20,870
Oh my god

5
00:00:21,000 --> 00:00:22,010
It's the glasses duo!

6
00:00:22,010 --> 00:00:24,680
You're right.
-We are not copying anyone

7
00:00:24,680 --> 00:00:26,030
There are others

8
00:00:26,610 --> 00:00:28,770
There are a lot

9
00:00:28,770 --> 00:00:30,310
Enough is enough
-Enough is enough

10
00:00:30,540 --> 00:00:32,100
So what are we here for?

11
00:00:33,030 --> 00:00:33,750
This time we bring you this:

12
00:00:33,750 --> 00:00:39,540
The 2nd edition of the theory from last year

13
00:00:39,540 --> 00:00:41,490
It is this:

14
00:00:41,490 --> 00:00:47,430
The 2nd "It's impossible to cry while doing the Matsuken Samba"

15
00:00:50,220 --> 00:00:53,200
I don't feel its worth doing this again

16
00:00:53,200 --> 00:00:53,940
Hasn't it already been proven?

17
00:00:53,940 --> 00:00:54,880
Do you remember?

18
00:00:54,880 --> 00:00:58,300
Of course, super hard to do

19
00:00:58,300 --> 00:01:00,430
As you know

20
00:01:00,430 --> 00:01:06,580
We did the project before of trying to cry while doing the Matsuken Samba

21
00:01:06,710 --> 00:01:08,410
It was a little hard to understand though

22
00:01:09,310 --> 00:01:10,360
He's very nervous right now

23
00:01:10,360 --> 00:01:12,860
At times like this, you don't make a joke at all?

24
00:01:12,860 --> 00:01:14,150
What is there to say?

25
00:01:15,010 --> 00:01:17,230
There's no script so this'll happen

26
00:01:17,230 --> 00:01:19,200
Well, while singing and dancing...
-Difficult

27
00:01:19,200 --> 00:01:22,340
I'm wondering if I can ask to do it

28
00:01:22,340 --> 00:01:23,820
You're so noisy
-What are you talking about?

29
00:01:24,990 --> 00:01:26,000
So scary

30
00:01:41,650 --> 00:01:48,320
The 2nd "It's impossible to cry while doing the Matsuken Samba"

31
00:01:49,040 --> 00:01:51,160
This time

32
00:01:51,160 --> 00:01:54,500
The challengers are dancing the Matsuken Samba

33
00:01:54,940 --> 00:01:58,090
57 seconds from the beginning of the second verse to the chorus

34
00:01:58,090 --> 00:02:02,320
Will they be able to cry?

35
00:02:03,580 --> 00:02:05,010
So

36
00:02:06,650 --> 00:02:08,130
This one won't work

37
00:02:06,670 --> 00:02:08,390
The first challenger is

38
00:02:08,390 --> 00:02:10,280
Diane's Tsuda

39
00:02:10,280 --> 00:02:12,580
Little things make me cry easily

40
00:02:11,850 --> 00:02:13,240
No way

41
00:02:12,580 --> 00:02:14,710
I cry whenever I think about certain things

42
00:02:14,710 --> 00:02:16,110
I am very confident about this

43
00:02:15,090 --> 00:02:16,690
A crybaby

44
00:02:16,250 --> 00:02:18,480
What kind of combat strategy will you use this time?

45
00:02:17,870 --> 00:02:20,510
No such impression
-No

46
00:02:18,480 --> 00:02:20,150
Battle strategy...

47
00:02:20,150 --> 00:02:25,060
The Rugby World Cup 2015 in South Africa

48
00:02:24,580 --> 00:02:25,930
It was a long time ago

49
00:02:25,290 --> 00:02:29,660
At that time, they photographed the audience who came from Japan to support the team

50
00:02:29,660 --> 00:02:31,200
There was someome that looked like a retired rugby player

51
00:02:31,200 --> 00:02:34,230
Looking at their faces, even now, will make me cry

52
00:02:34,230 --> 00:02:35,900
I can cry already, seriously

53
00:02:35,900 --> 00:02:40,770
There's one in the audience with glasses

54
00:02:36,380 --> 00:02:37,650
Really?

55
00:02:40,770 --> 00:02:43,070
I'm going to cry when I think of that person

56
00:02:41,800 --> 00:02:43,390
Maybe it will work

57
00:02:43,480 --> 00:02:45,780
Although I have never played rugby

58
00:02:45,060 --> 00:02:47,630
Really?

59
00:02:46,440 --> 00:02:51,290
Tsuda, who has a tear switch

60
00:02:47,630 --> 00:02:49,400
Obviously never played rugby

61
00:02:52,210 --> 00:02:55,970
Will he succeed?

62
00:02:59,490 --> 00:03:03,150
It's perfect.
-It's a perfect match

63
00:03:03,150 --> 00:03:05,000
A joyful appearance

64
00:03:10,440 --> 00:03:17,740
Bang the bongos, play the samba, dance the southern carnival

65
00:03:13,710 --> 00:03:18,700
It's a good song.
-Indeed

66
00:03:17,740 --> 00:03:26,850
Whoever you are, let's party, let's sweat and shine

67
00:03:22,430 --> 00:03:26,130
It's hard, can it really work?

68
00:03:26,850 --> 00:03:34,190
In the hot wind, I give my body to dance until my heart is satisfied

69
00:03:34,190 --> 00:03:42,930
The waves also sing the samba of love, the rhythm of the chest is full

70
00:03:37,930 --> 00:03:41,540
Remember, remember

71
00:03:41,540 --> 00:03:42,640
Go for it!

72
00:03:42,930 --> 00:04:01,550
Ole ole, Matsuken Samba! Ole ole, Matsuken Samba!

73
00:03:46,930 --> 00:03:48,670
No way

74
00:03:48,670 --> 00:03:50,520
That's pretty much it!

75
00:03:52,140 --> 00:03:54,170
Just a gloomy expression

76
00:03:55,110 --> 00:03:57,350
To dance is really a little

77
00:03:57,350 --> 00:04:00,250
The emotions are off.
-Yeah

78
00:04:01,450 --> 00:04:02,950
Impossible

79
00:04:01,550 --> 00:04:05,560
Ah, come to love, my friend, come to dance, my lady

80
00:04:03,420 --> 00:04:05,720
Out of time!
-20 seconds left

81
00:04:05,560 --> 00:04:11,300
Sleepless and restlessly dance until dawn

82
00:04:11,300 --> 00:04:24,010
Samba Viva Samba Matsuken Samba Ole!

83
00:04:13,720 --> 00:04:17,000
Hurry up!
-There's no time. There's no time

84
00:04:17,000 --> 00:04:18,860
Get in the mood.
-It's not working

85
00:04:19,970 --> 00:04:21,680
No tears at all

86
00:04:23,190 --> 00:04:26,400
That's the end of it.
-What are you doing?

87
00:04:26,400 --> 00:04:28,260
It's not the time for "Ole"!

88
00:04:29,580 --> 00:04:31,820
Can't cry at all

89
00:04:31,820 --> 00:04:35,150
I'm trying my best to remember that scene

90
00:04:35,850 --> 00:04:38,820
But the lyrics are too positive

91
00:04:37,810 --> 00:04:39,320
Indeed

92
00:04:39,500 --> 00:04:44,420
The one that nullifies all but the "joy" of happiness and sadness

93
00:04:44,420 --> 00:04:47,630
Devil's song "Matsuken Samba"

94
00:04:46,440 --> 00:04:50,340
The Devil's Song, this is awesome

95
00:04:49,290 --> 00:04:51,720
The next challenger is

96
00:04:54,830 --> 00:04:56,550
Takahashi Minami

97
00:04:55,350 --> 00:04:57,390
This one is different

98
00:04:57,940 --> 00:04:59,010
I feel like I probably

99
00:04:59,140 --> 00:05:03,680
Can dance and sing and cry more beautifully than any other challenger

100
00:05:02,240 --> 00:05:05,640
Indeed
-She has that impression

101
00:05:03,820 --> 00:05:07,120
I cried especially hard when I graduated from AKB

102
00:05:07,120 --> 00:05:08,420
It all came to me

103
00:05:08,420 --> 00:05:12,660
All of the happy and sad times in AKB

104
00:05:12,660 --> 00:05:15,190
I'm going to go back to those scenes in one fell swoop

105
00:05:14,520 --> 00:05:17,790
Indeed more likely that Tsuda

106
00:05:15,660 --> 00:05:17,530
I think it will work

107
00:05:18,250 --> 00:05:22,680
Songs, dances, and tears are all part of the job

108
00:05:22,680 --> 00:05:25,760
Arguably the strongest challenger in this project

109
00:05:27,200 --> 00:05:28,580
What will happen?

110
00:05:32,050 --> 00:05:34,970
The atmosphere is not depressing

111
00:05:35,610 --> 00:05:37,220
Good dancing

112
00:05:37,220 --> 00:05:39,310
Very brisk movements

113
00:05:44,610 --> 00:05:51,910
Bang the bongos, play the samba, dance the southern carnival

114
00:05:46,110 --> 00:05:49,370
This piece is still cheerful

115
00:05:51,350 --> 00:05:53,130
The lyrics are awesome!

116
00:05:51,910 --> 00:06:01,020
Whoever you are, let's party, let's sweat and shine

117
00:06:01,020 --> 00:06:08,360
In the hot wind, I give my body to dance until my heart is satisfied

118
00:06:02,730 --> 00:06:05,680
Here we go. Getting into shape

119
00:06:06,870 --> 00:06:08,020
Remember

120
00:06:08,360 --> 00:06:17,100
The waves also sing the samba of love, the rhythm of the chest is full

121
00:06:17,100 --> 00:06:35,720
Ole ole, Matsuken Samba! Ole ole, Matsuken Samba!

122
00:06:21,840 --> 00:06:23,220
Feels like it's coming soon

123
00:06:24,440 --> 00:06:26,810
Feels good

124
00:06:27,510 --> 00:06:29,070
30 seconds left

125
00:06:33,530 --> 00:06:34,980
Eyes already wet

126
00:06:35,720 --> 00:06:39,730
Ah, come to love, my friend, come to dance, my lady

127
00:06:37,190 --> 00:06:39,750
Is there no problem here? There is a phrase "my lady"

128
00:06:39,730 --> 00:06:45,470
Sleepless and restlessly dance until dawn

129
00:06:40,670 --> 00:06:41,860
Will all the work be lost?

130
00:06:44,140 --> 00:06:47,510
Time is almost up.
-15 seconds

131
00:06:45,470 --> 00:06:58,730
Samba Viva Samba Matsuken Samba Ole!

132
00:06:47,510 --> 00:06:48,760
Can do can do

133
00:06:51,360 --> 00:06:53,160
There is no more time

134
00:06:53,870 --> 00:06:55,550
Still not working?

135
00:06:57,360 --> 00:06:58,520
The end

136
00:07:02,730 --> 00:07:04,740
It's too hard

137
00:07:04,680 --> 00:07:06,740
It's too hard

138
00:07:05,940 --> 00:07:08,910
It's really disheartening

139
00:07:08,910 --> 00:07:11,680
If I have another 10 seconds, I may be able to cry

140
00:07:12,040 --> 00:07:15,380
Although it reminds me of the past of AKB

141
00:07:15,380 --> 00:07:20,850
Jumping and jumping Mr. Akimoto and Mr. Matsudaira Ken mixed together

142
00:07:17,190 --> 00:07:19,380
Now the tears are flowing
-Too bad

143
00:07:20,850 --> 00:07:25,160
How to put it ... now I can cry a lot

144
00:07:23,790 --> 00:07:26,060
It's confusing.
-Pity

145
00:07:25,160 --> 00:07:27,960
And now you are in the state?
-Yes, I'm in the state

146
00:07:27,960 --> 00:07:33,870
Although I was in the state the dance is too intense

147
00:07:28,230 --> 00:07:29,710
Another 10 seconds

148
00:07:33,230 --> 00:07:34,880
So close

149
00:07:34,300 --> 00:07:37,700
I wish I could have another 10 seconds

150
00:07:37,210 --> 00:07:39,180
Just a little bit

151
00:07:38,270 --> 00:07:40,460
The next challenger is

152
00:07:42,090 --> 00:07:43,940
Forget about this guy.
-Bad guy

153
00:07:42,970 --> 00:07:46,060
Yasuda Dai Circus's Kuro-chan

154
00:07:46,640 --> 00:07:49,210
Last time I cried

155
00:07:49,660 --> 00:07:52,240
That's right, when it comes to Kuro-chan

156
00:07:52,820 --> 00:07:56,830
He completed a challenge of crying during the chorus of a song

157
00:07:56,830 --> 00:07:59,830
The first successful winner of the chorus crying contest

158
00:07:56,950 --> 00:07:58,730
The singing style is terrible

159
00:07:59,830 --> 00:08:05,610
To eliminate your demons

160
00:08:04,260 --> 00:08:06,560
After all, it is this kind of music

161
00:08:06,140 --> 00:08:11,440
I'm also getting drenched today

162
00:08:06,560 --> 00:08:07,840
Sad

163
00:08:07,840 --> 00:08:09,600
This time the song is not the same

164
00:08:13,270 --> 00:08:16,410
I think I was asked to come because the project was too difficult

165
00:08:16,410 --> 00:08:19,660
I've experienced a lot of nasty things so far

166
00:08:19,660 --> 00:08:22,310
In this program especially

167
00:08:21,640 --> 00:08:25,070
That's right, he has experienced a lot of things

168
00:08:22,310 --> 00:08:23,920
So I can cry

169
00:08:24,840 --> 00:08:27,780
So Kuro-chan tackles the challenge

170
00:08:27,780 --> 00:08:30,360
Will he succeed?

171
00:08:29,670 --> 00:08:30,900
Scary

172
00:08:30,360 --> 00:08:31,520
What'll happen?

173
00:08:30,900 --> 00:08:32,550
It's scary when he laughs

174
00:08:32,550 --> 00:08:33,860
A bit like Kuwano

175
00:08:33,860 --> 00:08:34,940
Very similar indeed

176
00:08:38,310 --> 00:08:45,700
Bang the bongos, play the samba, dance the southern carnival

177
00:08:45,700 --> 00:08:54,720
Whoever you are, let's party, let's sweat and shine

178
00:08:46,460 --> 00:08:47,800
Pretty good

179
00:08:52,290 --> 00:08:54,580
Start from here

180
00:08:54,580 --> 00:08:56,070
Can he do it?

181
00:08:54,720 --> 00:09:02,060
In the hot wind, I give my body to dance until my heart is satisfied

182
00:09:02,060 --> 00:09:10,800
The waves also sing the samba of love, the rhythm of the chest is full

183
00:09:03,610 --> 00:09:04,690
Already in the zone

184
00:09:04,690 --> 00:09:08,250
Come on!
-There's still a chance here

185
00:09:09,170 --> 00:09:11,020
There are still 40 seconds left

186
00:09:10,800 --> 00:09:29,420
Ole ole, Matsuken Samba! Ole ole, Matsuken Samba!

187
00:09:15,350 --> 00:09:17,060
The singing is really bad

188
00:09:17,060 --> 00:09:18,440
There's no way around it

189
00:09:19,260 --> 00:09:21,570
A distorted expression

190
00:09:21,570 --> 00:09:23,170
The expressions are great

191
00:09:28,440 --> 00:09:29,590
It depends on what happens next

192
00:09:29,420 --> 00:09:33,430
Ah, come to love, my friend, come to dance, my lady

193
00:09:33,430 --> 00:09:39,170
Sleepless and restlessly dance until dawn

194
00:09:34,370 --> 00:09:35,660
This won't work, will it?

195
00:09:37,650 --> 00:09:40,030
Oh, no.
-Not good

196
00:09:39,170 --> 00:09:51,670
Samba Viva Samba Matsuken Samba Ole!

197
00:09:40,030 --> 00:09:41,150
Last 10 seconds

198
00:09:41,930 --> 00:09:43,460
Running out of time

199
00:09:44,120 --> 00:09:45,550
Impossible

200
00:09:46,910 --> 00:09:49,380
It's really hard!

201
00:09:49,380 --> 00:09:51,660
Kuro-chan can't do it

202
00:09:53,830 --> 00:09:55,990
Just a sad expression

203
00:10:00,240 --> 00:10:02,410
Good work, everyone!

204
00:10:01,310 --> 00:10:02,420
What are you talking about?

205
00:10:02,880 --> 00:10:07,250
Although I was sad, I couldn't cry to this song

206
00:10:07,760 --> 00:10:13,260
Even the strongest challengers are powerless

207
00:10:13,260 --> 00:10:17,200
The impossible crying son Matsuken Samba

208
00:10:17,200 --> 00:10:19,600
Who can do it?

209
00:10:20,140 --> 00:10:22,460
The next challenger is

210
00:10:22,230 --> 00:10:24,250
AMEMIYA

211
00:10:25,610 --> 00:10:26,880
AMEMIYA

212
00:10:27,610 --> 00:10:30,610
I cry quite easily.
-Is that so?

213
00:10:30,880 --> 00:10:33,080
At child abuse and stuff like that

214
00:10:33,080 --> 00:10:35,950
When I see news like that, I cry out of anger

215
00:10:35,950 --> 00:10:38,450
Also cry when I watch "Crash Landing on You"

216
00:10:37,700 --> 00:10:38,830
I understand

217
00:10:38,720 --> 00:10:43,960
The last episode of the "4 o'clock" program, I also cried after watching it

218
00:10:44,120 --> 00:10:46,260
You have a very wide range of crying points

219
00:10:46,260 --> 00:10:51,630
How to say, my emotional ups and downs are still very intense

220
00:10:55,290 --> 00:10:58,160
This expression is too terrible

221
00:10:58,160 --> 00:11:00,680
Can't even recognize who it is

222
00:11:00,680 --> 00:11:02,430
A bit scary indeed

223
00:11:02,430 --> 00:11:03,440
This expression is great

224
00:11:03,440 --> 00:11:05,930
Eyes wide open, no problem, right?

225
00:11:05,960 --> 00:11:13,250
Bang the bongos, play the samba, dance the southern carnival

226
00:11:08,370 --> 00:11:10,080
That's a good one.
-Indeed

227
00:11:13,250 --> 00:11:22,370
Whoever you are, let's party, let's sweat and shine

228
00:11:14,840 --> 00:11:16,200
The action is a little scary

229
00:11:16,930 --> 00:11:19,930
Too stiff, the body is shaking

230
00:11:19,930 --> 00:11:23,380
The singing is good but not the dancing

231
00:11:22,370 --> 00:11:29,710
In the hot wind, I give my body to dance until my heart is satisfied

232
00:11:29,710 --> 00:11:38,450
The waves also sing the samba of love, the rhythm of the chest is full

233
00:11:32,200 --> 00:11:33,550
Seems like he'll cry

234
00:11:37,840 --> 00:11:39,240
Getting into the mood

235
00:11:38,450 --> 00:11:56,960
Ole ole, Matsuken Samba! Ole ole, Matsuken Samba!

236
00:11:49,450 --> 00:11:51,130
What kind of emotion is this?

237
00:11:51,750 --> 00:11:52,150
Can it be done?

238
00:11:52,150 --> 00:11:53,120
What's this?

239
00:11:56,960 --> 00:12:01,080
Ah, come to love, my friend, come to dance, my lady

240
00:12:01,080 --> 00:12:06,820
Sleepless and restlessly dance until dawn

241
00:12:02,870 --> 00:12:05,400
Can't do it

242
00:12:05,830 --> 00:12:07,900
No more time

243
00:12:06,820 --> 00:12:19,050
Samba Viva Samba Matsuken Samba Ole!

244
00:12:10,230 --> 00:12:13,380
There's no time
-Not good

245
00:12:15,590 --> 00:12:18,240
Just a sad expression

246
00:12:22,550 --> 00:12:23,970
No tears were shed

247
00:12:23,720 --> 00:12:26,560
Didn't cry

248
00:12:26,890 --> 00:12:29,630
Not crying?

249
00:12:29,630 --> 00:12:30,900
No

250
00:12:31,290 --> 00:12:33,660
The next challenger is

251
00:12:31,900 --> 00:12:33,360
It's too hard

252
00:12:35,950 --> 00:12:39,230
Mr. SASUKE Yamada Katsumi

253
00:12:36,460 --> 00:12:38,930
You guys really love using Yamada!

254
00:12:38,930 --> 00:12:41,890
But he seems like he might be the type

255
00:12:40,140 --> 00:12:42,610
I'm confident I can cry

256
00:12:43,380 --> 00:12:48,620
We've seen it a hundred times, everyone is familiar with Katsumi Yamada

257
00:12:47,810 --> 00:12:49,770
You don't have to say 100 times

258
00:12:48,620 --> 00:12:50,610
SASUKE is my everything!

259
00:12:52,950 --> 00:12:54,490
When it comes to SASUKE, I can cry easily

260
00:12:54,490 --> 00:12:56,950
Just cried a week ago

261
00:12:57,000 --> 00:12:58,210
Really?

262
00:12:57,710 --> 00:12:59,070
What'll happen?

263
00:13:11,640 --> 00:13:18,940
Bang the bongos, play the samba, dance the southern carnival

264
00:13:12,280 --> 00:13:13,580
Why is his face so colorful?

265
00:13:15,310 --> 00:13:17,310
Singing is quite gentle, really unexpected

266
00:13:18,250 --> 00:13:20,400
It's awesome!
-Singing and dancing well

267
00:13:18,940 --> 00:13:28,050
Whoever you are, let's party, let's sweat and shine

268
00:13:28,050 --> 00:13:35,390
In the hot wind, I give my body to dance until my heart is satisfied

269
00:13:35,390 --> 00:13:44,140
The waves also sing the samba of love, the rhythm of the chest is full

270
00:13:42,480 --> 00:13:44,210
Not dancing

271
00:13:48,760 --> 00:13:50,510
It's okay to fast forward

272
00:13:48,970 --> 00:13:50,680
Ole!

273
00:13:50,510 --> 00:13:53,430
This is too much.
-What the hell?

274
00:13:53,140 --> 00:13:54,450
Sorry

275
00:13:53,430 --> 00:13:57,300
It's too much.
-Really?

276
00:13:55,010 --> 00:13:57,120
The next challengers are

277
00:13:59,320 --> 00:14:00,520
Kintaro

278
00:13:59,870 --> 00:14:01,510
Kintaro

279
00:14:02,190 --> 00:14:06,120
Since becoming a mother its been very easy to cry

280
00:14:05,120 --> 00:14:06,550
Yes

281
00:14:06,360 --> 00:14:10,060
People who have had children should be able to understand

282
00:14:10,060 --> 00:14:13,800
It's really easy to cry compared to before

283
00:14:14,000 --> 00:14:15,800
Do you have a battle plan?

284
00:14:15,800 --> 00:14:20,540
My two years old child is in a difficult rebellious period

285
00:14:20,540 --> 00:14:25,640
Its tough being a mother

286
00:14:25,740 --> 00:14:31,280
So I want to express my gratitude to my mother

287
00:14:30,930 --> 00:14:32,610
Seems like a good way to cry

288
00:14:31,280 --> 00:14:35,320
But now that mom is gone

289
00:14:35,550 --> 00:14:40,320
I should be able to cry while thinking of my mother

290
00:14:38,950 --> 00:14:40,660
Should work

291
00:14:40,660 --> 00:14:42,530
Indeed, you'd be moved

292
00:14:40,940 --> 00:14:47,510
Now remembering her late mother, she wont be fooling around

293
00:14:48,730 --> 00:14:50,090
What'll happen?

294
00:14:52,470 --> 00:14:53,370
Does this remind you of your mother?

295
00:14:55,960 --> 00:14:58,100
Its just too funny

296
00:15:03,170 --> 00:15:05,020
The expression is too terrible

297
00:15:05,030 --> 00:15:12,320
Bang the bongos, play the samba, dance the southern carnival

298
00:15:07,250 --> 00:15:09,710
Singing and dancing are good

299
00:15:11,370 --> 00:15:15,630
True, although not yet in the mood

300
00:15:12,320 --> 00:15:21,440
Whoever you are, let's party, let's sweat and shine

301
00:15:19,870 --> 00:15:22,360
Got it all figured out.
-Great!

302
00:15:21,440 --> 00:15:28,780
In the hot wind, I give my body to dance until my heart is satisfied

303
00:15:23,060 --> 00:15:25,260
We're in the zone.
-Here we go

304
00:15:25,260 --> 00:15:26,650
Koroke!

305
00:15:28,780 --> 00:15:37,520
The waves also sing the samba of love, the rhythm of the chest is full

306
00:15:31,240 --> 00:15:32,950
A small Koroke

307
00:15:34,700 --> 00:15:37,170
But it does get you into the mood

308
00:15:37,170 --> 00:15:38,950
Memories of Mom

309
00:15:37,520 --> 00:15:56,130
Ole ole, Matsuken Samba! Ole ole, Matsuken Samba!

310
00:15:46,610 --> 00:15:47,760
Remember

311
00:15:51,260 --> 00:15:54,130
Tears are coming out
-Amazing

312
00:15:54,740 --> 00:15:56,860
It's already flowing out, right?

313
00:15:56,130 --> 00:16:00,150
Ah, come to love, my friend, come to dance, my lady

314
00:15:57,950 --> 00:16:01,320
Amazing! Amazing! Unbelievable!

315
00:16:00,150 --> 00:16:05,890
Sleepless and restlessly dance until dawn

316
00:16:05,260 --> 00:16:07,620
That's awesome!

317
00:16:05,890 --> 00:16:18,390
Samba Viva Samba Matsuken Samba Ole!

318
00:16:10,680 --> 00:16:12,620
Crying like crazy!
-Really crying

319
00:16:12,620 --> 00:16:15,340
Tears are flowing
-Seriously!?

320
00:16:18,030 --> 00:16:21,200
Perfect
-Terrific

321
00:16:21,200 --> 00:16:23,750
Awesome
-Scary scary scary

322
00:16:24,000 --> 00:16:25,200
Impressive

323
00:16:25,500 --> 00:16:26,430
It's like Kabuki!

324
00:16:26,700 --> 00:16:29,430
Thank you. You've did it.
-Great!

325
00:16:30,510 --> 00:16:31,960
Both eyes are tearing up

326
00:16:32,070 --> 00:16:34,410
Thank you so much!

327
00:16:34,240 --> 00:16:35,320
Really great

328
00:16:35,770 --> 00:16:40,930
7 seconds into the second main verse of the crying section

329
00:16:36,430 --> 00:16:37,850
It's fast

330
00:16:40,930 --> 00:16:43,260
Tears were already shining in the corners of her eyes

331
00:16:42,880 --> 00:16:44,130
Only 7 seconds in

332
00:16:46,120 --> 00:16:49,070
It's really fast.
-Amazing

333
00:16:50,310 --> 00:16:51,890
It's out! It's out!

334
00:16:50,790 --> 00:16:55,210
14 seconds later, she succeeded in shedding tears

335
00:16:52,950 --> 00:16:56,680
Awesome

336
00:16:57,410 --> 00:17:01,800
After that there were also tears from the other side of the eye

337
00:17:01,600 --> 00:17:04,030
Awesome
-This is really awesome

338
00:17:02,220 --> 00:17:05,630
So, she completed the Matsuken Samba crying project

339
00:17:06,400 --> 00:17:07,710
Really?

340
00:17:07,710 --> 00:17:11,510
I'm betting all of 2022 on this

341
00:17:11,980 --> 00:17:14,780
Finishing the year on this, it was worth it

342
00:17:14,520 --> 00:17:15,760
What are you talking about?

343
00:17:14,780 --> 00:17:15,750
Thank you

344
00:17:15,750 --> 00:17:22,820
In Summary
If there is a sequel, it will be a Genghis Khan tear project

345
00:17:19,810 --> 00:17:21,400
This really does not work

346
00:17:22,820 --> 00:17:24,420
Genghis Khan is too far

347
00:17:24,420 --> 00:17:25,590
Awesome

348
00:17:26,790 --> 00:17:29,310
It's over. Someone really did it

349
00:17:29,310 --> 00:17:32,200
So, how do you feel?

350
00:17:32,730 --> 00:17:34,470
It was really a big surprise

351
00:17:34,470 --> 00:17:36,490
Yes
-A big surprise

352
00:17:36,490 --> 00:17:37,640
It's true

353
00:17:37,640 --> 00:17:40,070
She was so cool at the end.
-Indeed

354
00:17:40,070 --> 00:17:41,740
It was like Kabuki

355
00:17:43,110 --> 00:17:45,480
You wouldn't be able to do it, right?
-No way

356
00:17:45,480 --> 00:17:50,310
But I do feel that the longing for one's mother can really overpower "Matsuken Samba"!

357
00:17:50,310 --> 00:17:52,650
What are you saying here all of a sudden?
-It's too sudden

358
00:17:53,220 --> 00:17:57,930
Mr. SASUKE, you fast-forwarded it, wouldn't cutting it be better?

359
00:17:58,560 --> 00:18:01,370
He was invited at least

360
00:18:03,770 --> 00:18:06,260
Let's welcome the next presenter

361
00:18:11,280 --> 00:18:14,200
Magical Lovely!

362
00:18:15,880 --> 00:18:17,650
We are Magical Lovely

363
00:18:17,650 --> 00:18:18,960
Magi-Love

364
00:18:18,960 --> 00:18:21,410
We are Magical Love

365
00:18:21,410 --> 00:18:22,780
It's not short for a Magical Love

366
00:18:22,780 --> 00:18:24,680
Yes, I'm in Magic Haruka

367
00:18:24,680 --> 00:18:25,850
Magic Haruka?

368
00:18:25,850 --> 00:18:27,890
The name has become strange
-Opportunities like this don't happen too much

369
00:18:27,890 --> 00:18:28,900
Magic Haruri?

370
00:18:31,620 --> 00:18:36,860
Have people ever said bad things about others or talked badly about people behind their backs?

371
00:18:36,860 --> 00:18:37,890
Yuuchami, have you?

372
00:18:37,890 --> 00:18:39,700
If I have anything to say I generally say it directly in person

373
00:18:39,700 --> 00:18:40,930
I see

374
00:18:40,930 --> 00:18:42,380
So I don't really say bad things behind people's backs

375
00:18:42,380 --> 00:18:43,530
A typical gyaru

376
00:18:43,530 --> 00:18:47,970
So this time we have a project about badmouthing

377
00:18:47,970 --> 00:18:52,240
The King of inducing people to talk badly behind the backs of others

378
00:18:53,570 --> 00:18:54,350
Induction King

379
00:18:55,090 --> 00:18:57,750
Senior comedians will be the setters

380
00:18:57,750 --> 00:19:00,780
And will attempt to induce junior artists to speak ill of them behind their backs

381
00:19:00,780 --> 00:19:01,440
I see

382
00:19:01,440 --> 00:19:04,920
I drank with Kubota of Toro Salmon before

383
00:19:05,220 --> 00:19:08,320
He kept bad-mouthing Kyojin

384
00:19:08,320 --> 00:19:10,530
Everyone in Japan knows this.
-Is that so?

385
00:19:10,530 --> 00:19:13,260
That's not backbiting anymore.
-So it's not backbiting

386
00:19:28,480 --> 00:19:32,820
The King of inducing people to talk badly behind the backs of others

387
00:19:33,600 --> 00:19:37,580
This time, the contestants are four comedians

388
00:19:38,690 --> 00:19:42,100
The first one is Cunning's Takeyama

389
00:19:43,010 --> 00:19:47,410
The next generation of comedians to be targeted are these four

390
00:19:48,660 --> 00:19:50,400
But one of them

391
00:19:50,400 --> 00:19:52,320
Higuchi

392
00:19:52,320 --> 00:19:57,050
Is an accomplice controlling the direction of the conversation

393
00:19:55,520 --> 00:19:57,210
So there are spys

394
00:19:57,210 --> 00:19:59,000
He's controlling the situation

395
00:19:59,080 --> 00:20:02,180
My idea is to intimidate them directly at the beginning

396
00:20:02,330 --> 00:20:05,450
But it's somewhat unnatural to suddenly intimidate them

397
00:20:05,450 --> 00:20:08,950
So I'll just be unpleasant from the very beginning

398
00:20:09,090 --> 00:20:11,290
And i'll focus on one after another

399
00:20:11,290 --> 00:20:13,690
Slamming their character and attitude towards their work

400
00:20:13,690 --> 00:20:15,930
I'm prepared to do this but here's the problem

401
00:20:16,160 --> 00:20:17,730
The people's styles etc

402
00:20:17,730 --> 00:20:19,960
I don't even know what kind of work they do

403
00:20:19,960 --> 00:20:23,630
But since none of them are popular i'll just focus on this

404
00:20:23,770 --> 00:20:26,040
Only by imagination

405
00:20:26,730 --> 00:20:30,530
By the way, this time at Misaki Fishing Port in Kanagawa Prefecture

406
00:20:30,540 --> 00:20:33,250
They are recording the next morning in a location shoot

407
00:20:33,250 --> 00:20:37,170
As the group came to the local accommodation one day in advance for the shooting

408
00:20:39,170 --> 00:20:40,680
Then on that night

409
00:20:40,680 --> 00:20:42,790
At the dinner invited by the seniors

410
00:20:42,790 --> 00:20:46,010
The backstabbing challenge takes place

411
00:20:47,560 --> 00:20:50,390
Although these words wont really help you...

412
00:20:50,390 --> 00:20:51,960
I'll say it. I didn't want to do this job

413
00:20:52,500 --> 00:20:54,400
Ah really

414
00:20:54,630 --> 00:20:56,200
I spoke to my agent

415
00:20:56,200 --> 00:20:59,440
That guy clearly said something like "Okay, I get it".

416
00:20:59,440 --> 00:21:00,740
But still added me to the job

417
00:21:00,820 --> 00:21:03,670
With you unpopular guys

418
00:21:03,670 --> 00:21:06,240
Eh?
-What kind of location shoot is this

419
00:21:06,780 --> 00:21:10,050
Just like Takeyama stated before, he is immediately angry from the outset

420
00:21:10,530 --> 00:21:13,410
At this point in time when the atmosphere is heavy

421
00:21:13,880 --> 00:21:16,220
The game begins

422
00:21:16,580 --> 00:21:17,760
Matsu, you...

423
00:21:17,760 --> 00:21:21,130
It's been a long time since we've seen each other, but I'd like to say something
-Ok

424
00:21:21,330 --> 00:21:24,530
Tomorrow's Sun Music Live is a first-tier live performance, right?

425
00:21:24,530 --> 00:21:28,200
How long have you been there, but you still aren't leading it?

426
00:21:28,200 --> 00:21:30,970
You can't say you're at my level, right?

427
00:21:31,200 --> 00:21:33,440
Yes
-You also said that you "rehearse the segment every day"

428
00:21:33,440 --> 00:21:36,540
You also said "we can't go to the sauna together today"

429
00:21:36,840 --> 00:21:39,540
How is Nori doing these days? Still not gained popularity?

430
00:21:39,810 --> 00:21:43,310
Indeed, not much movement

431
00:21:44,180 --> 00:21:46,550
Didn't you start in this business with Kazlaser?

432
00:21:46,550 --> 00:21:48,720
Aren't you contemporaries?
-Yes

433
00:21:47,380 --> 00:21:48,260
Really?

434
00:21:48,990 --> 00:21:50,990
And Kaz is super popular now, right?

435
00:21:50,990 --> 00:21:52,460
Aren't your frustrated?

436
00:21:52,860 --> 00:21:54,390
I don't pay attention to him

437
00:21:54,390 --> 00:21:57,030
Even if you say "I don't pay attention", I can't help it

438
00:21:57,230 --> 00:21:59,030
Its hopeless if you're just choosing to ignore it

439
00:21:59,030 --> 00:22:02,230
Anyway, giving up being a comedian isn't the same as dying

440
00:22:01,730 --> 00:22:04,960
Pretty convincing

441
00:22:02,780 --> 00:22:03,760
Going further

442
00:22:04,440 --> 00:22:05,540
Already on board?

443
00:22:05,870 --> 00:22:07,570
Yes, I'm an official member now

444
00:22:07,840 --> 00:22:12,180
You're a member of Sun Music?
-Yes

445
00:22:13,180 --> 00:22:15,950
Done any Lives?
-Yes, I did

446
00:22:16,210 --> 00:22:18,120
What if you get more work?

447
00:22:18,420 --> 00:22:20,450
I'm on paid leave

448
00:22:20,450 --> 00:22:23,720
With this attitude you can't make it
-Indeed

449
00:22:23,720 --> 00:22:27,210
I think you should not stay in the company with such an uncertain attitude

450
00:22:27,210 --> 00:22:28,730
It will cause trouble for others

451
00:22:29,160 --> 00:22:32,160
Do a good job. Be serious.
-Okay

452
00:22:33,370 --> 00:22:37,280
After preaching precisely to the three juniors like this

453
00:22:39,700 --> 00:22:41,070
I'm going first

454
00:22:41,070 --> 00:22:43,270
They don't know what I said for my comment "sorry, I forgot" they said

455
00:22:43,270 --> 00:22:44,780
What do you mean by "forgot", you bastard

456
00:22:45,410 --> 00:22:47,280
Don't oversleep for me tomorrow!

457
00:22:47,510 --> 00:22:48,950
I won't oversleep

458
00:22:48,950 --> 00:22:50,780
Really if you oversleep I'll kill you

459
00:22:51,380 --> 00:22:55,540
After dropping his final harsh comment, he retires for the night

460
00:22:56,480 --> 00:22:57,330
At this time

461
00:22:58,160 --> 00:23:00,820
So annoying

462
00:23:00,820 --> 00:23:03,630
He really has something wrong with his brain

463
00:23:03,790 --> 00:23:06,800
I can't watch, too scary

464
00:23:06,800 --> 00:23:08,930
I can't stand this type

465
00:23:08,930 --> 00:23:10,470
He's so pretentious

466
00:23:10,470 --> 00:23:12,070
Just now also when coming in

467
00:23:12,070 --> 00:23:14,340
That walk, what is he acting like?

468
00:23:14,340 --> 00:23:16,440
Wants to walk with the aura of an entertainer'
-What entertainer!?

469
00:23:16,440 --> 00:23:18,010
But that guy is usually

470
00:23:18,010 --> 00:23:20,640
"Hehehehehehe" just sitting there laughing

471
00:23:20,780 --> 00:23:22,580
Come on, someone stop him!

472
00:23:23,010 --> 00:23:24,680
They don't want me to laugh like that?

473
00:23:23,960 --> 00:23:24,890
Scary

474
00:23:24,820 --> 00:23:26,580
"Hehehe hisshisshiss"

475
00:23:27,920 --> 00:23:32,610
Badmouthing the seniors when they are not around

476
00:23:28,820 --> 00:23:31,000
They sure know how to talk!

477
00:23:31,770 --> 00:23:33,050
Only stupid people smoke

478
00:23:32,700 --> 00:23:33,620
Then

479
00:23:33,560 --> 00:23:34,580
Looks so happy

480
00:23:34,860 --> 00:23:37,160
He must have felt the same way when we traveled to Kyushu together

481
00:23:37,160 --> 00:23:38,560
So suddenly got angry then too

482
00:23:38,900 --> 00:23:42,300
Did he start to get angry when he left Tokyo?

483
00:23:42,290 --> 00:23:44,200
This sentence is super laughable

484
00:23:43,330 --> 00:23:45,670
Is it because he's nervous?
-No, it can't be

485
00:23:46,290 --> 00:23:51,480
The bad things being said behind the scenes are not only about this time, but also previous times

486
00:23:49,050 --> 00:23:50,450
Bad

487
00:23:50,450 --> 00:23:52,290
It is difficult to say bad things about seniors

488
00:23:52,080 --> 00:23:54,940
I said, "I'm going back to Osaka," but he was mean to me for three hours

489
00:23:55,110 --> 00:23:57,680
I was asked, "What did you do the next day?" I said, "I went back to Osaka."

490
00:23:57,680 --> 00:23:59,620
He said, "Why? Everyone is working so hard."

491
00:23:59,620 --> 00:24:01,450
Three hours of lecturing like this

492
00:24:01,690 --> 00:24:02,620
Yeah, with me

493
00:24:02,620 --> 00:24:05,260
At a barbecue place I just asked for a bowl of rice

494
00:24:05,260 --> 00:24:07,790
He shouted "What the hell are you doing eating rice at barbecue!?"

495
00:24:07,790 --> 00:24:09,620
Went on for six hours

496
00:24:09,890 --> 00:24:13,700
What a way to talk! These guys have poison tongues

497
00:24:14,110 --> 00:24:16,750
Then the conversation goes even deeper

498
00:24:17,870 --> 00:24:19,500
Although it may not be appropriate to say this, but I think the guy really

499
00:24:19,500 --> 00:24:21,540
I think if I really argue back I can absolutely win

500
00:24:22,640 --> 00:24:24,640
I just have that feeling

501
00:24:23,200 --> 00:24:24,140
His last words

502
00:24:24,810 --> 00:24:26,270
Its not like that

503
00:24:26,680 --> 00:24:27,980
Like a high school student

504
00:24:27,980 --> 00:24:30,550
I had the same feeling when I was his driver

505
00:24:30,550 --> 00:24:34,890
I thought "I could just drive straight off the capital highway at any time"

506
00:24:34,890 --> 00:24:36,120
Straight off of the highway

507
00:24:36,120 --> 00:24:38,460
I want us both to die right now, like this

508
00:24:38,460 --> 00:24:40,620
This is the first time I've heard of such an thought

509
00:24:40,620 --> 00:24:42,160
He wants to kill me!

510
00:24:41,820 --> 00:24:43,010
So sad

511
00:24:42,330 --> 00:24:44,360
Doesn't he always ask for people's help? It's confusing

512
00:24:44,360 --> 00:24:46,330
What do you mean by "Come with me to the shoot"?

513
00:24:46,330 --> 00:24:48,200
Always something unreasonable

514
00:24:47,780 --> 00:24:49,480
I've probably done the same

515
00:24:48,400 --> 00:24:51,000
Once I was told to "wait in the car"

516
00:24:51,000 --> 00:24:56,240
I would deliberately smoke cigarettes in the car

517
00:24:56,470 --> 00:24:59,180
This guy. This guy

518
00:24:59,650 --> 00:25:04,360
This is no longer a backstabbing, its a secret revenge plan

519
00:25:05,680 --> 00:25:08,390
When I worked for him as a driver

520
00:25:08,390 --> 00:25:10,120
In his Toyota Alfa, I XXXX loads of times

521
00:25:13,390 --> 00:25:17,790
Really?

522
00:25:13,730 --> 00:25:15,260
This is bad

523
00:25:17,790 --> 00:25:20,300
They really don't deserve to be popular

524
00:25:20,770 --> 00:25:22,240
Right at that moment

525
00:25:25,270 --> 00:25:28,170
Scared me
-We'll be done in a minute

526
00:25:27,220 --> 00:25:29,450
Everyone sat down at once

527
00:25:28,920 --> 00:25:32,810
The sudden return makes the targets panic

528
00:25:29,450 --> 00:25:30,900
Everyone's stiffened all of a sudden

529
00:25:33,440 --> 00:25:35,280
Anyway, you must be saying bad things about me

530
00:25:35,410 --> 00:25:39,350
No, no, no, not at all
-How can we say anything bad about you?

531
00:25:40,090 --> 00:25:44,490
Unveiling the whole thing under a clichéd lie

532
00:25:41,980 --> 00:25:45,250
You guys are really bad

533
00:25:53,160 --> 00:25:56,070
You all said a lot of bad things

534
00:25:56,070 --> 00:25:58,840
The moment I left, you started talking bad

535
00:25:59,270 --> 00:26:03,770
And what did you do to my car when you were my driver
-Ah, well...

536
00:26:03,770 --> 00:26:05,980
Uh... what did i...?

537
00:26:06,110 --> 00:26:08,810
What's going on here? Where did it start?
-I heard it from the beginning to the end

538
00:26:08,810 --> 00:26:10,750
Is it limited to this venue? You heard the bad things from just now?

539
00:26:11,620 --> 00:26:14,050
What do you mean here only?
-Did you hear the bad words in the car over?

540
00:26:14,050 --> 00:26:15,650
You talked bad about me in the car?

541
00:26:15,980 --> 00:26:17,280
That was close

542
00:26:19,640 --> 00:26:28,480
The next challenger is Impulse's Tsutsumishita and the target is these four juniors

543
00:26:27,690 --> 00:26:29,400
Sloppy members

544
00:26:31,090 --> 00:26:36,000
The next challenger is Impulse's Tsutsumishita

545
00:26:36,640 --> 00:26:39,640
How old is Satake?
-39 years old. The same age as us

546
00:26:40,110 --> 00:26:41,680
I'll be 40 years old this year

547
00:26:42,080 --> 00:26:43,550
What about Mr. Half?

548
00:26:43,550 --> 00:26:47,580
Mr. Half?

549
00:26:45,600 --> 00:26:46,660
What does that mean?

550
00:26:47,580 --> 00:26:49,600
He's split in two

551
00:26:49,600 --> 00:26:51,490
When did this happen?

552
00:26:51,490 --> 00:26:53,560
It's not for anyone's sake

553
00:26:53,560 --> 00:26:56,660
I just wanted to be more eye-catching

554
00:26:57,800 --> 00:27:02,370
They are just talking about the strange tricks of unpopular artists to receive attention

555
00:27:03,570 --> 00:27:09,410
Why don't you put more effort in comedy?

556
00:27:09,540 --> 00:27:13,040
I thought about trying.
-No, no, you didn't

557
00:27:13,040 --> 00:27:14,620
More than just a thought

558
00:27:14,880 --> 00:27:17,910
It feels like you didn't make any action

559
00:27:18,180 --> 00:27:20,020
You're 46 now too, right?
-Yes

560
00:27:20,020 --> 00:27:22,130
What'll you do when you're 50?

561
00:27:22,130 --> 00:27:23,890
Okamoto is the same way

562
00:27:23,900 --> 00:27:27,960
This guy has been in the industry for a while but look at him now

563
00:27:27,960 --> 00:27:30,490
You don't even know what you want to do, do you?

564
00:27:30,610 --> 00:27:33,730
You're too half-assed when it comes to comedy

565
00:27:34,970 --> 00:27:37,530
Half-assed?
-Completely

566
00:27:36,660 --> 00:27:38,120
So true

567
00:27:37,630 --> 00:27:40,740
This approach will also bleed into your daily life

568
00:27:40,740 --> 00:27:43,610
You'll lose your way

569
00:27:43,610 --> 00:27:46,440
You think this about my comedy?
-Your comedy as well as other things

570
00:27:46,610 --> 00:27:50,150
I guess all of you are not very motivated

571
00:27:47,180 --> 00:27:48,650
Good way to criticize

572
00:27:50,150 --> 00:27:52,880
I don't really think thats the case

573
00:27:53,050 --> 00:27:56,750
Why don't you just quit your jobs?

574
00:27:56,450 --> 00:27:58,300
Seems to be angry

575
00:27:57,420 --> 00:27:59,690
When drinking just now, I asked "What do you want to eat?"

576
00:27:58,290 --> 00:27:59,700
He's angry

577
00:27:59,690 --> 00:28:01,290
And also said "this is really delicious"

578
00:28:01,600 --> 00:28:02,690
None of this is funny

579
00:28:02,690 --> 00:28:05,000
You're all just saying "what's delicious?"

580
00:28:05,400 --> 00:28:07,560
Obviously I want to joke around

581
00:28:07,560 --> 00:28:09,410
But you guys don't even pick up on it

582
00:28:10,720 --> 00:28:16,890
After his stern rebuke

583
00:28:14,780 --> 00:28:16,840
Everyone is holding back

584
00:28:18,140 --> 00:28:21,810
I'm bored really
-Sorry

585
00:28:21,810 --> 00:28:23,480
I'm going

586
00:28:22,620 --> 00:28:23,820
What a clever induction

587
00:28:24,140 --> 00:28:27,410
Leaving after dropping 30,000 for a dinner party

588
00:28:28,930 --> 00:28:30,620
What will happen?

589
00:28:30,620 --> 00:28:31,920
They are holding back

590
00:28:32,820 --> 00:28:34,160
That

591
00:28:34,360 --> 00:28:38,860
I haven't been out drinking for a long time,  is this the atmosphere now?

592
00:28:38,860 --> 00:28:40,430
Does this happen often?

593
00:28:40,430 --> 00:28:42,730
Or just when he's in a bad mood?

594
00:28:42,830 --> 00:28:45,270
It's possible

595
00:28:45,270 --> 00:28:47,670
But there's nothing you can do about this stuff

596
00:28:48,070 --> 00:28:51,340
Just simply venting their frustrations, right?

597
00:28:51,640 --> 00:28:52,940
First of all, what did he just say?

598
00:28:52,940 --> 00:28:55,510
I thought "Who are you to say that?"

599
00:28:55,610 --> 00:28:58,220
Like when he said, "What are you going to do from now on?"

600
00:28:58,350 --> 00:28:59,780
He's concerned

601
00:28:59,780 --> 00:29:03,050
Although he said a lot of things out of concern

602
00:29:03,050 --> 00:29:04,020
But I'm also very concerned about that guy's situation

603
00:29:04,020 --> 00:29:06,090
Called me "that guy"

604
00:29:05,640 --> 00:29:06,800
Already started

605
00:29:07,090 --> 00:29:12,290
The juniors who have entered the rhythm of badmouthing have started to call him "that guy"

606
00:29:08,860 --> 00:29:09,660
So fast

607
00:29:10,460 --> 00:29:12,080
Gradually showing their aggressiveness

608
00:29:12,080 --> 00:29:13,880
Really angry

609
00:29:13,630 --> 00:29:16,530
He seems to think that eating just a little is

610
00:29:16,530 --> 00:29:18,340
Very cool

611
00:29:18,340 --> 00:29:19,700
Yeah yeah

612
00:29:19,700 --> 00:29:20,800
But I don't know what he's pretending to be

613
00:29:20,800 --> 00:29:23,410
He's showing off

614
00:29:24,070 --> 00:29:25,980
Talking about some very serious topics to make himself feel cool

615
00:29:25,980 --> 00:29:28,750
He himself does not even know that his ability is the lower-mid level

616
00:29:28,750 --> 00:29:31,210
What lower middle level, his ability is right on the edge

617
00:29:31,210 --> 00:29:33,080
His look is also bad
-It's a disaster

618
00:29:33,080 --> 00:29:35,520
Fat and ugly face with a ghostly appearance

619
00:29:35,520 --> 00:29:36,550
Pure stupidity

620
00:29:35,930 --> 00:29:36,740
They won't stop

621
00:29:36,750 --> 00:29:40,220
I've come to hate these guys really

622
00:29:40,390 --> 00:29:43,660
Throws the money down and says "I'm leaving"

623
00:29:43,790 --> 00:29:46,330
There were times when the money he drops isn't even enough to settle the bill, right?
-It's true

624
00:29:46,330 --> 00:29:48,500
Pretending to not know the price of something

625
00:29:48,500 --> 00:29:50,200
His brain is messed up

626
00:29:50,530 --> 00:29:51,300
I'm an idiot, right?

627
00:29:51,300 --> 00:29:53,100
But that stupid pig?

628
00:29:53,100 --> 00:29:54,370
These two shiny titles

629
00:29:54,370 --> 00:29:56,370
Isn't it tough being such an idiot?

630
00:29:56,540 --> 00:30:00,640
Saying i'm a stupid pig is too much, right? It's tough

631
00:30:00,640 --> 00:30:02,850
A real character attack

632
00:30:02,850 --> 00:30:05,550
When comedians get together

633
00:30:05,550 --> 00:30:08,590
He always starts with this seniority stuff

634
00:30:08,840 --> 00:30:10,990
He thinks he's on top

635
00:30:10,990 --> 00:30:12,420
When really, he's the worst

636
00:30:12,520 --> 00:30:15,130
How can he still stand on the head of others?

637
00:30:15,560 --> 00:30:20,900
At this point, one member continues to unleash an unstoppable tirade

638
00:30:22,600 --> 00:30:24,670
He's really quite a loser

639
00:30:24,670 --> 00:30:25,600
Completely

640
00:30:25,600 --> 00:30:27,870
Because he used to work for NSC

641
00:30:27,870 --> 00:30:29,470
Everyone hates him

642
00:30:29,640 --> 00:30:33,410
He really makes people angry, that piece of shit

643
00:30:33,540 --> 00:30:36,920
Frankly speaking, we hate him from the bottom of our hearts, right?

644
00:30:36,920 --> 00:30:38,800
My two-year-old daughter is more obedient

645
00:30:38,800 --> 00:30:39,980
A no-go is a no-go

646
00:30:41,250 --> 00:30:43,390
Hello

647
00:30:43,840 --> 00:30:45,360
Scary!

648
00:30:45,360 --> 00:30:47,100
I don't want to look

649
00:30:49,330 --> 00:30:50,390
Still drinking?

650
00:30:50,660 --> 00:30:51,660
Drinking and chatting happily

651
00:30:51,660 --> 00:30:53,230
Drinking and talking well?
-Yes

652
00:30:53,230 --> 00:30:55,300
We were talking about how to change ourselves starting tomorrow

653
00:30:55,300 --> 00:30:57,830
And talking about tuna

654
00:30:57,410 --> 00:30:58,380
Tuna?

655
00:30:57,830 --> 00:31:00,440
Talking about this kind of stuff the whole time?
-Yes

656
00:31:00,860 --> 00:31:03,970
To the juniors clearly did not talk about any of this

657
00:31:04,860 --> 00:31:06,570
We revealed the truth

658
00:31:06,610 --> 00:31:07,850
This is too much to bear

659
00:31:07,850 --> 00:31:09,340
Super difficult

660
00:31:12,380 --> 00:31:13,880
What the hell is this?

661
00:31:13,880 --> 00:31:16,940
Then, the content of this project was conveyed to them

662
00:31:17,820 --> 00:31:19,720
Wow!

663
00:31:19,720 --> 00:31:23,030
Wait, what is this situation?

664
00:31:23,030 --> 00:31:26,560
I heard it all when I wasn't here!

665
00:31:26,760 --> 00:31:29,800
About 40 minutes of badmouthing me without stopping

666
00:31:29,800 --> 00:31:32,200
But I also know your nature

667
00:31:30,320 --> 00:31:32,210
Scary, what to do now?

668
00:31:32,740 --> 00:31:34,100
I'll apologize afterwards

669
00:31:34,100 --> 00:31:36,110
I will apologize to you solemnly afterwards

670
00:31:36,110 --> 00:31:38,210
It's really too much.
-Ah, this... this...

671
00:31:38,760 --> 00:31:42,520
The next challenger is the Nichokenju' Kobori

672
00:31:43,080 --> 00:31:46,720
The target is these four junior artists

673
00:31:47,760 --> 00:31:51,050
Always feel a little messed up

674
00:31:51,050 --> 00:31:52,190
Not that it's perfunctory either

675
00:31:52,190 --> 00:31:55,530
Its like eating up your savings

676
00:31:55,690 --> 00:31:58,960
Do you mean we aren't challenging ourselves to do something new?

677
00:31:58,780 --> 00:32:00,340
He is sure to be badmouthed

678
00:32:00,050 --> 00:32:08,580
"You're too comfortable with the status quo," Kobori said to Keishi and Murakami for about an hour

679
00:32:08,580 --> 00:32:11,780
That's a great choice.
-The scene must be very confusing

680
00:32:09,580 --> 00:32:10,460
Then

681
00:32:11,110 --> 00:32:15,150
I really think you're unacceptable

682
00:32:15,890 --> 00:32:20,820
After dropping a simple "You're unacceptable" to New Okabe

683
00:32:22,450 --> 00:32:27,210
He retreats as before with an unhappy look

684
00:32:33,330 --> 00:32:35,830
Did he get weird from halfway through?

685
00:32:36,200 --> 00:32:37,770
Yeah, really

686
00:32:37,770 --> 00:32:41,040
There really are some seniors that our concerned for our wellbeing
-Some

687
00:32:41,040 --> 00:32:44,910
I thought he didn't even take us seriously

688
00:32:44,910 --> 00:32:47,640
No, don't compliment me

689
00:32:48,220 --> 00:32:49,130
But

690
00:32:49,910 --> 00:32:51,380
What did he say to you, Okabe?

691
00:32:51,920 --> 00:32:57,720
Honestly... unacceptable

692
00:32:59,190 --> 00:33:01,960
Although it is a small thing

693
00:33:01,960 --> 00:33:04,160
Didn't I give him some cigarettes?

694
00:33:04,360 --> 00:33:05,860
You did?

695
00:33:06,660 --> 00:33:12,070
He only smoked a tiny bit

696
00:33:12,070 --> 00:33:14,440
It's true, so I can't say its badmouthing

697
00:33:14,440 --> 00:33:16,540
Look, look, look, look, it's still long, right?

698
00:33:17,510 --> 00:33:20,380
All of the finished ones are the same lengths

699
00:33:23,730 --> 00:33:24,920
This is really not good, right?

700
00:33:23,950 --> 00:33:27,550
Same, same.
-It's very even. It's completely consistent

701
00:33:27,550 --> 00:33:30,620
He's only smoking the tip of it!

702
00:33:34,090 --> 00:33:37,490
Not ingesting the nicotine at all

703
00:33:37,490 --> 00:33:39,930
So why is he even smoking?
-The look

704
00:33:39,930 --> 00:33:42,770
It's over for him

705
00:33:43,000 --> 00:33:44,870
He's pissing me off. What a statement!

706
00:33:44,870 --> 00:33:46,100
What do you mean by "the look"?

707
00:33:46,270 --> 00:33:48,740
A fake smoker

708
00:33:48,740 --> 00:33:50,540
All for appearance?

709
00:33:50,540 --> 00:33:51,570
Smoking to look cool

710
00:33:51,710 --> 00:33:54,640
Not to be a cool comedian but a musician

711
00:33:54,640 --> 00:33:56,210
He definitely pretends to be like that

712
00:33:57,060 --> 00:33:58,850
They're looking down on me!

713
00:33:59,320 --> 00:34:00,060
And

714
00:34:00,580 --> 00:34:02,290
Jun as well

715
00:34:02,450 --> 00:34:04,420
I'm always being lectured by him

716
00:34:04,540 --> 00:34:07,590
I don't think it's a problem at all.
-That's not possible, is it?

717
00:34:07,590 --> 00:34:09,240
Won't there be "question marks" in your head when you are being lectured?

718
00:34:09,240 --> 00:34:11,260
There will, but, how to put it...

719
00:34:11,260 --> 00:34:14,460
Even if we talk back he doesn't understand

720
00:34:14,860 --> 00:34:16,000
Oi!

721
00:34:16,000 --> 00:34:18,100
That's the worst!

722
00:34:18,100 --> 00:34:20,100
Then

723
00:34:18,900 --> 00:34:20,580
Totally looked down on

724
00:34:21,000 --> 00:34:23,670
Although it might be a bit much

725
00:34:23,670 --> 00:34:25,280
I've always thought i'll never lose to him

726
00:34:26,440 --> 00:34:27,680
This is not good!

727
00:34:27,680 --> 00:34:29,580
Never thought of losing to Nichokenju

728
00:34:29,580 --> 00:34:31,710
No, not Nichokenju, just Kobori

729
00:34:32,220 --> 00:34:37,080
When Kobori returns to his seat as before

730
00:34:38,050 --> 00:34:41,460
The truth is revealed

731
00:34:39,840 --> 00:34:40,890
The mood is heavy

732
00:34:40,890 --> 00:34:41,980
It's getting heavy

733
00:34:46,230 --> 00:34:47,700
Oh...

734
00:34:49,730 --> 00:34:51,470
This is Wednesday Downtown

735
00:34:50,860 --> 00:34:51,610
Good face

736
00:34:54,600 --> 00:34:56,380
You said, "i'll never lose to him"

737
00:34:57,240 --> 00:34:59,140
That sentence hurt me the most

738
00:34:59,410 --> 00:35:01,640
What do you mean by "i'll never lose to him"?

739
00:35:01,780 --> 00:35:03,980
Look at the wristband

740
00:35:04,780 --> 00:35:06,620
He's pretending to be a musician

741
00:35:06,620 --> 00:35:08,090
It's not like that!

742
00:35:08,650 --> 00:35:11,650
So the final challenger is

743
00:35:12,700 --> 00:35:14,240
This candidate is a little dangerous

744
00:35:14,210 --> 00:35:19,560
Nagano is assisted by a junior at his firm

745
00:35:19,550 --> 00:35:20,760
What will happen?

746
00:35:20,360 --> 00:35:23,730
This is a good opportunity to convey the facts

747
00:35:23,730 --> 00:35:25,030
For them

748
00:35:25,030 --> 00:35:27,570
They wont say something they've never thought

749
00:35:27,570 --> 00:35:29,540
To incite them hard

750
00:35:29,540 --> 00:35:31,980
I'll start with the psychological aspect

751
00:35:31,980 --> 00:35:35,110
And then just let them talk bad about me, right?
-Yes

752
00:35:35,120 --> 00:35:37,510
I usually scold them

753
00:35:37,510 --> 00:35:39,380
Do you usually tell them off?
-Usually

754
00:35:39,380 --> 00:35:42,650
I've scolded all of them before, yeah

755
00:35:42,010 --> 00:35:42,920
Really

756
00:35:43,640 --> 00:35:46,800
Although Nagano is confident about this project

757
00:35:47,650 --> 00:35:48,900
What will happen?

758
00:35:50,560 --> 00:35:54,560
If you know which artist is badmouthing you behind you back, they'll be sent away as soon as possible

759
00:35:54,560 --> 00:35:56,170
What do you mean "sent away?"

760
00:35:56,170 --> 00:35:58,670
Never work with him again

761
00:35:58,670 --> 00:36:02,020
I'd like to think that I would accept it with an open mind and move on

762
00:36:03,530 --> 00:36:07,360
It's rare for these members to get together so why don't I just say it

763
00:36:07,440 --> 00:36:11,080
It's really impossible for you, right now

764
00:36:11,080 --> 00:36:13,820
How long ago did you decide to be comedians?

765
00:36:15,250 --> 00:36:19,860
If something happens, the office will fire you

766
00:36:20,330 --> 00:36:24,000
First Nagano lectures the helper

767
00:36:24,440 --> 00:36:27,490
Making the atmosphere worse

768
00:36:28,440 --> 00:36:29,420
Then

769
00:36:29,770 --> 00:36:32,200
Isn't Shinichi very strange lately?

770
00:36:32,340 --> 00:36:34,690
Will you get the trophy again?

771
00:36:34,690 --> 00:36:37,310
Get the R-1 trophy by playing dumb?

772
00:36:37,400 --> 00:36:39,280
I think so

773
00:36:39,280 --> 00:36:42,180
I've always wanted to get it back
-That!

774
00:36:42,180 --> 00:36:45,220
But now its like "is it ever gonna happen?"

775
00:36:45,220 --> 00:36:46,080
The staff thinks so

776
00:36:46,880 --> 00:36:49,150
Everyone is tired of your act

777
00:36:49,150 --> 00:36:51,690
You're just playing the fool

778
00:36:49,180 --> 00:36:51,220
In fact, only Nagano-san thinks so

779
00:36:51,700 --> 00:36:55,290
The trophy has passed by so many times

780
00:36:55,430 --> 00:36:57,530
Shinichi almost got it

781
00:36:57,530 --> 00:37:00,700
I've pretty much had enough

782
00:36:59,880 --> 00:37:01,960
Already starting to get angry

783
00:37:00,700 --> 00:37:04,360
Shinichi's stuff is just not funny anymore

784
00:37:04,700 --> 00:37:08,440
Although you seem to be fine with it, what are you going to do in the future?

785
00:37:08,970 --> 00:37:10,870
This will not work

786
00:37:10,880 --> 00:37:14,240
You've also made a lot of enemies because you have been badmouthing others

787
00:37:14,900 --> 00:37:17,360
With Nagano's natural sinister look

788
00:37:17,540 --> 00:37:18,780
Don't say it's natural!

789
00:37:18,440 --> 00:37:24,650
This session differs greatly from the previous lectures

790
00:37:25,990 --> 00:37:27,060
As expected of him

791
00:37:27,100 --> 00:37:28,420
Straight to the core now

792
00:37:29,090 --> 00:37:31,790
Fujiwara too

793
00:37:31,790 --> 00:37:34,800
The final of King of Conte?
-Yes

794
00:37:34,800 --> 00:37:38,500
How many times have you been in the final?
-3 times

795
00:37:38,500 --> 00:37:41,100
3 times to the final?
-Yes

796
00:37:41,300 --> 00:37:44,940
In the final 3 times but still not popular, such a waste

797
00:37:45,610 --> 00:37:48,040
Indeed

798
00:37:48,040 --> 00:37:50,080
Isn't it awful?

799
00:37:50,080 --> 00:37:54,750
It still depends on the audience, if they don't like you its impossible

800
00:37:53,970 --> 00:37:55,180
Speak for yourself

801
00:37:54,750 --> 00:37:59,090
Does anyone like you guys?

802
00:37:59,220 --> 00:38:01,060
Not many fans, no

803
00:38:01,060 --> 00:38:02,930
No, right?
-Yes

804
00:38:02,210 --> 00:38:03,420
Feels like it's about to explode

805
00:38:03,190 --> 00:38:05,560
You also

806
00:38:05,560 --> 00:38:10,430
I don't even know what your purpose is

807
00:38:10,430 --> 00:38:13,040
You're writing more

808
00:38:13,040 --> 00:38:15,610
On various programs

809
00:38:15,610 --> 00:38:19,130
Although Shinichi's stuff isn't funny

810
00:38:19,130 --> 00:38:20,780
They're used at least, despite not being funny

811
00:38:20,690 --> 00:38:21,730
Angry?

812
00:38:20,970 --> 00:38:22,810
How to put it...

813
00:38:22,810 --> 00:38:26,220
Aren't you a big guy?

814
00:38:26,220 --> 00:38:27,480
It's really disgusting

815
00:38:27,750 --> 00:38:31,590
There are loads of entertainers over one meter seven

816
00:38:32,720 --> 00:38:39,420
In this way, he vents his usual outrageous words for an hour

817
00:38:40,050 --> 00:38:40,970
Terrible

818
00:38:41,700 --> 00:38:45,230
Drink what you want. Here's the money

819
00:38:45,640 --> 00:38:50,900
Dropping a 3,000 yen dinner fee, which was not even enough for one person, he leaves

820
00:38:48,900 --> 00:38:52,650
Too cheap, right?

821
00:38:52,140 --> 00:38:53,280
He's gone

822
00:38:53,280 --> 00:38:55,450
He's really gone

823
00:38:55,450 --> 00:38:58,180
What a guy

824
00:38:58,180 --> 00:39:01,150
Isn't tomorrow's shoot going to be awful?

825
00:39:01,150 --> 00:39:02,620
Not great

826
00:39:02,990 --> 00:39:06,490
Isn't he jealous? Because Shinichi got there first

827
00:39:06,490 --> 00:39:08,760
Saying all that about Shinichi

828
00:39:09,060 --> 00:39:11,260
His complex seems clear

829
00:39:11,260 --> 00:39:13,530
Really bad, he said such a lot of strange things

830
00:39:13,530 --> 00:39:16,600
You really don't need to care
-You don't need to care about what he said

831
00:39:16,220 --> 00:39:18,020
They're all very kind

832
00:39:16,770 --> 00:39:21,170
Mostly because no one at R-1 takes him seriously

833
00:39:21,170 --> 00:39:23,440
Because you won, he has an inferiority complex

834
00:39:23,610 --> 00:39:26,880
He's a bundle of low self-esteem

835
00:39:27,110 --> 00:39:32,180
And his popularity is now gone, too

836
00:39:32,180 --> 00:39:35,520
So he's become neurotic

837
00:39:32,980 --> 00:39:33,920
The devil

838
00:39:35,950 --> 00:39:38,220
So he hurts others with his words

839
00:39:39,490 --> 00:39:41,700
Because of Nagano's tone of voice

840
00:39:41,200 --> 00:39:42,860
Shinichi is really upset

841
00:39:41,700 --> 00:39:47,360
The juniors did not mix any funny elements and instead just bad-mouth seriously

842
00:39:48,870 --> 00:39:51,370
But Shinichi, you've been on set recently

843
00:39:51,370 --> 00:39:53,940
Aren't there a lot of times you perform with him?
-Yes

844
00:39:54,040 --> 00:39:55,870
I'm super wary of him.
-Ha?

845
00:39:55,870 --> 00:39:57,700
Super wary

846
00:39:57,840 --> 00:40:01,310
What happened to make you feel like that?

847
00:40:01,310 --> 00:40:04,150
Everything, literally everything

848
00:40:04,150 --> 00:40:09,790
It's so tiring
-You're lying, right? I thought we had a good relationship

849
00:40:11,350 --> 00:40:15,320
I think he has too much pride

850
00:40:15,790 --> 00:40:18,600
In the end, he has no charisma at all

851
00:40:18,600 --> 00:40:22,430
He thinks he does?
-I used to think so

852
00:40:21,770 --> 00:40:23,050
So serious!

853
00:40:22,430 --> 00:40:23,930
I don't think he has charisma

854
00:40:23,930 --> 00:40:26,870
I just pretended to respect him

855
00:40:27,040 --> 00:40:29,040
Really?

856
00:40:29,040 --> 00:40:31,440
He's always said that before... eh?

857
00:40:31,690 --> 00:40:33,740
That guy is just a drag.
-A drag?

858
00:40:33,740 --> 00:40:36,450
It's a big drag.
-What do you mean, on set?

859
00:40:36,450 --> 00:40:39,750
He's the type that just wants whats best for himself

860
00:40:39,750 --> 00:40:45,960
So because I also hope to do well, i've been desperately trying to please him

861
00:40:45,960 --> 00:40:47,860
But on TV

862
00:40:48,060 --> 00:40:49,690
He drags everything down

863
00:40:49,690 --> 00:40:52,530
This is also too hurtful

864
00:40:52,300 --> 00:40:55,000
Looks so sad

865
00:40:54,930 --> 00:40:58,030
I really feel like keeping my distance from him

866
00:40:58,030 --> 00:40:59,370
I've gradually understood everything

867
00:40:59,370 --> 00:41:02,300
I can't stand that guy right now

868
00:41:04,070 --> 00:41:05,440
Can't stand me?

869
00:41:04,970 --> 00:41:06,370
Good and true bad words

870
00:41:06,310 --> 00:41:08,940
It was tough from the start but right now its really impossible

871
00:41:08,940 --> 00:41:11,910
So that's what you thought, Shinichi?

872
00:41:11,910 --> 00:41:14,920
I thought he was a very cool and interesting person

873
00:41:14,920 --> 00:41:19,020
But a part of his character makes him impossible to like

874
00:41:19,020 --> 00:41:21,020
I really think so

875
00:41:21,260 --> 00:41:24,160
If he wants to go to dinner together I definitely will not go

876
00:41:24,160 --> 00:41:26,630
So that's what you think?

877
00:41:25,640 --> 00:41:26,860
So real

878
00:41:26,930 --> 00:41:30,630
You know what? He never takes the lead

879
00:41:30,630 --> 00:41:31,830
He absolutely must take a back seat

880
00:41:32,000 --> 00:41:34,670
He himself said that "playing the fool is really a skill"

881
00:41:34,670 --> 00:41:37,840
But instead he just acts like a big shot

882
00:41:37,840 --> 00:41:39,940
Hiding in the back, not wanting to be found

883
00:41:39,940 --> 00:41:43,250
He also always wears a hat, but even if he doesn't no one will recognize him

884
00:41:43,250 --> 00:41:45,450
You wouldn't recognize him if you ran into him on the train, right?

885
00:41:43,520 --> 00:41:45,040
Unstoppable

886
00:41:45,450 --> 00:41:46,920
With a strange hat
-Really weird

887
00:41:46,920 --> 00:41:48,890
Gross, a gross dude

888
00:41:48,890 --> 00:41:50,690
Can't even tie shoelaces

889
00:41:50,690 --> 00:41:52,220
So he probably can't even live a normal life

890
00:41:52,220 --> 00:41:54,790
From now on, I really can't work with him on set

891
00:41:54,790 --> 00:41:55,860
Same with live shows

892
00:41:55,860 --> 00:41:57,520
Either is impossible

893
00:41:57,520 --> 00:42:01,060
This project is really difficult to top

894
00:42:01,060 --> 00:42:04,300
I really hope he can work more carefully

895
00:42:04,300 --> 00:42:05,600
And he's also stingy as hell

896
00:42:05,970 --> 00:42:08,770
Seriously, does he ever treat anyone?

897
00:42:09,010 --> 00:42:13,340
The money he gave is not enough at all.
-Really?

898
00:42:13,340 --> 00:42:15,180
What can you do with 3,000 yen?

899
00:42:15,180 --> 00:42:17,850
He probably doesn't understand the price of goods

900
00:42:17,850 --> 00:42:19,250
And he can't count

901
00:42:19,750 --> 00:42:22,520
Because he only goes to cheap izakayas

902
00:42:22,520 --> 00:42:24,120
Doesn't know the price of anything

903
00:42:24,120 --> 00:42:26,620
Just drops 3,000 yen as a token of appreciation

904
00:42:25,320 --> 00:42:28,760
This is bad

905
00:42:26,620 --> 00:42:28,460
I really think he's not thinking straight

906
00:42:28,620 --> 00:42:31,960
Its so frustrating

907
00:42:31,960 --> 00:42:36,870
What do you guys hate most about Nagano-san?

908
00:42:36,870 --> 00:42:39,100
I don't like his scruffy look either
-Ha?

909
00:42:39,100 --> 00:42:42,240
It's really disgusting

910
00:42:42,240 --> 00:42:44,570
Only wears lame shoes

911
00:42:44,570 --> 00:42:47,510
Dirty socks, dirty underwear too

912
00:42:47,780 --> 00:42:50,350
When he's changing you can see his wrinkly underwear

913
00:42:50,520 --> 00:42:53,280
That old "Grape" logo

914
00:42:54,410 --> 00:43:02,400
Ultimately, lots of bad things were said from various angles

915
00:43:00,350 --> 00:43:02,360
Like search engine keywords

916
00:43:03,580 --> 00:43:06,650
At this point, he returns

917
00:43:07,460 --> 00:43:08,720
And we reveal the truth

918
00:43:12,200 --> 00:43:14,840
What's going on?

919
00:43:15,040 --> 00:43:15,970
Who?

920
00:43:15,970 --> 00:43:17,670
What program?

921
00:43:17,670 --> 00:43:18,840
Which show?

922
00:43:19,110 --> 00:43:20,610
Shinichi's?

923
00:43:20,610 --> 00:43:22,850
I really don't understand what's going on at all

924
00:43:23,010 --> 00:43:25,890
This is Wednesday Downtown

925
00:43:27,950 --> 00:43:30,050
Seriously!?

926
00:43:30,220 --> 00:43:33,290
So after informing them of the content of the project

927
00:43:35,930 --> 00:43:38,530
So you heard everything?

928
00:43:38,530 --> 00:43:40,730
It's not true, Nagano

929
00:43:40,730 --> 00:43:43,030
It's not true, what I said

930
00:43:43,030 --> 00:43:45,640
The worst... really bad

931
00:43:44,410 --> 00:43:46,020
Look at Nagano's face

932
00:43:46,170 --> 00:43:48,340
I really think this is a project that should not be done

933
00:43:48,440 --> 00:43:50,670
This expression

934
00:43:50,720 --> 00:43:52,800
This is not an expression for a variety show

935
00:43:52,980 --> 00:43:56,380
This time, really...
-It's really bad...

936
00:43:56,950 --> 00:44:00,020
This relationship... we have...

937
00:44:01,520 --> 00:44:03,890
Well...

938
00:44:03,890 --> 00:44:06,190
Our relationship is over
-No, no, no

939
00:44:06,490 --> 00:44:09,530
It's not like that, it's really not like that

940
00:44:08,410 --> 00:44:10,160
It's already irreparable

941
00:44:09,530 --> 00:44:11,960
This is the end

942
00:44:11,960 --> 00:44:19,200
In summary
Nagano is the King

943
00:44:19,200 --> 00:44:20,450
This is embarrassing

944
00:44:21,000 --> 00:44:22,050
How about this project?

945
00:44:22,050 --> 00:44:24,470
Matsumoto, do you think this project should not be done?

946
00:44:24,470 --> 00:44:27,560
This is really bad this time

947
00:44:30,420 --> 00:44:34,010
I also think Grape Company is done for

948
00:44:34,010 --> 00:44:35,360
It was already struggling

949
00:44:35,360 --> 00:44:38,350
Before the company was stronger
-Now it's bad

950
00:44:38,350 --> 00:44:40,970
After all, the juniors were wound up

951
00:44:41,600 --> 00:44:44,340
That's why they are cursing

952
00:44:44,340 --> 00:44:47,700
The juniors are more fired up than usual

953
00:44:47,700 --> 00:44:51,030
Why do they have to make so much effort to rile them up?

954
00:44:51,030 --> 00:44:52,700
So true

955
00:44:52,700 --> 00:44:54,240
Let's not do it a 2nd time, then

956
00:44:54,240 --> 00:44:56,740
It's too harsh
-Let's do it again

957
00:44:56,740 --> 00:44:58,970
Regardless of whether to do it again or not

958
00:44:58,970 --> 00:45:02,750
It shouldn't have been done the first time

959
00:45:03,420 --> 00:45:05,760
I drink with my juniors all the time

960
00:45:05,760 --> 00:45:10,790
It's great, and everything is said with respect

961
00:45:10,790 --> 00:45:12,660
Even so, when you leave they still say

962
00:45:12,660 --> 00:45:15,260
"So annoying"

963
00:45:15,260 --> 00:45:16,930
What is that response?

964
00:45:19,160 --> 00:45:22,100
It is better not to say bad things behind others

965
00:45:22,100 --> 00:45:24,370
How to put it

966
00:45:24,370 --> 00:45:27,070
I don't want it to end yet

967
00:45:27,070 --> 00:45:28,520
You want to end on a lighter note, don't you?

968
00:45:30,970 --> 00:45:33,140
I would like to talk more

969
00:45:33,140 --> 00:45:34,540
Just let it end

970
00:45:34,710 --> 00:45:37,680
I don't want to go back to the lounge yet

971
00:45:37,680 --> 00:45:40,140
Let's all hold hands and go back together in a friendly manner

972
00:45:40,140 --> 00:45:42,890
Let's live in harmony, after all, it is a funny show

973
00:45:42,890 --> 00:46:14,850
