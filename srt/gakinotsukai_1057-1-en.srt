Yes yes!

11
00:00:07,420 --> 00:00:10,930
We're going for a drive today.

12
00:00:08,620 --> 00:00:11,560
That's right! But since it's this weather,

13
00:00:11,630 --> 00:00:16,300
let's watch how long it takes Irie to get angry from being in the rain.

14
00:00:16,300 --> 00:00:18,300
He's getting really wet!

15
00:00:16,510 --> 00:00:21,840
Holding the Chiki Chiki banner for 22 years

00:00:16,510 --> 00:00:21,840

Let's do this for 30 minutes.

19
00:00:19,430 --> 00:00:21,360
He's been there for ages!

20
00:00:20,300 --> 00:00:22,300
He just stays there.

21
00:00:21,360 --> 00:00:24,150
He's still smiling though.

22
00:00:22,300 --> 00:00:24,150
Yes, well he's still smiling now.

23
00:00:24,190 --> 00:00:28,490
Anyway, everyone brought their favourite albums today.

24
00:00:29,650 --> 00:00:31,940
And songs you want us to hear.

25
00:00:30,260 --> 00:00:38,830
As they drive, the five will play "personally special" songs and explain an episode behind it.

26
00:00:30,260 --> 00:00:38,830
Today's Theme

27
00:00:31,940 --> 00:00:36,930
Good songs that you think "I've got this memory about!"

28
00:00:35,720 --> 00:00:37,730
We've prepared some!

29
00:00:36,930 --> 00:00:40,440
I'd like you all to reveal some.

30
00:00:39,340 --> 00:00:41,500
What's this?

31
00:00:40,440 --> 00:00:42,680
Oh, thank you very much.

32
00:00:44,330 --> 00:00:46,260
Yes so...

33
00:00:45,120 --> 00:00:48,200
Hamada-san! I knew you'd be curious about this!

34
00:00:48,250 --> 00:00:51,800
Why do you always have an item like that recently?

35
00:00:51,800 --> 00:00:54,530
He had a thing for the "Hit and Wear Scissors Paper Rock" too!

36
00:00:53,030 --> 00:00:54,510
Yeah.

37
00:00:54,530 --> 00:00:57,030
Socks!

38
00:00:55,380 --> 00:00:57,320
Oh yeah socks!

39
00:00:57,030 --> 00:01:01,200
But the audience were apparently saying my socks were cute.

40
00:01:01,200 --> 00:01:03,800
And that's....

41
00:01:03,800 --> 00:01:06,720
Yeah but what is it?

42
00:01:06,800 --> 00:01:09,190
What? They're my CD's.

43
00:01:07,970 --> 00:01:10,100
Oh you put it in there?

44
00:01:09,190 --> 00:01:12,600
I've got quite a lot so, I put it in this.

45
00:01:11,770 --> 00:01:13,340
A lot?

46
00:01:12,600 --> 00:01:15,480
Yes, I can't tell you much though.

47
00:01:14,350 --> 00:01:18,010
Even during this pointless talk, Irie is still enduring it.

48
00:01:17,250 --> 00:01:19,180
That's right!

49
00:01:18,010 --> 00:01:20,850
I think that annoyed him a bit.

50
00:01:33,750 --> 00:01:35,830
But seriously....

51
00:01:37,100 --> 00:01:39,620
Songs that we have attachments to.

52
00:01:38,640 --> 00:01:42,830
Well I'm sure there are some related to the rain too but...

53
00:01:42,220 --> 00:01:44,440
There are heaps.

54
00:01:44,250 --> 00:01:46,910
But you haven't chosen any have you?

55
00:01:45,670 --> 00:01:47,740
Well, I wonder...

56
00:01:46,980 --> 00:01:49,600
So how is it then everyone?

57
00:01:48,370 --> 00:01:51,510
Somebody may have chosen one.

58
00:01:50,240 --> 00:01:54,300
But I really thought "Yamazaki's so stupid" before.

59
00:01:53,730 --> 00:01:56,900
Wait a second! Why?

60
00:01:56,310 --> 00:01:58,890
Well we've got this corner today right?

61
00:01:58,510 --> 00:01:59,900
Yes.

62
00:01:58,910 --> 00:02:01,250
And we were in the dressing rooms together right?

63
00:02:00,540 --> 00:02:02,080
Yes.

64
00:02:01,720 --> 00:02:03,840
He was friggin' singing it.

65
00:02:03,840 --> 00:02:06,630
I was like "He's such an idiot!

66
00:02:05,680 --> 00:02:08,490
What? A song that he's gonna play?

67
00:02:06,780 --> 00:02:10,480
That's right. He's probably thinking in his head like....

68
00:02:10,000 --> 00:02:12,130
Whaaat?

69
00:02:10,480 --> 00:02:12,370
"I really like this song~"

70
00:02:12,390 --> 00:02:15,940
He was casually humming it during a normal conversation.

71
00:02:15,940 --> 00:02:19,540
And I was thinking "Man, he's totally gonna use that..."

72
00:02:17,990 --> 00:02:20,570
I've heard several songs already!

73
00:02:19,540 --> 00:02:21,400
You have right?

74
00:02:20,640 --> 00:02:22,940
I couldn't help it!

75
00:02:21,400 --> 00:02:24,060
Seriously...he's so stupid~

76
00:02:22,990 --> 00:02:25,060
Are you excited or something?

77
00:02:24,060 --> 00:02:26,050
I am~!

78
00:02:25,040 --> 00:02:27,600
Because you want us to hear?

79
00:02:26,050 --> 00:02:31,430
Well no, it got stuck in my head when I was choosing.

80
00:02:30,670 --> 00:02:33,100
That's what I thought.

81
00:02:31,470 --> 00:02:34,030
And it just comes out.

82
00:02:33,200 --> 00:02:35,150
Can I play some now?

83
00:02:34,070 --> 00:02:36,340
Yeah I think so.

84
00:02:37,500 --> 00:02:40,480
Can I play one of mine then?

85
00:02:38,960 --> 00:02:40,480
Yes please.

86
00:02:41,390 --> 00:02:43,380
I'd like to hear yours.

87
00:02:42,620 --> 00:02:46,700
I wonder what you think about this one.

88
00:02:46,700 --> 00:02:51,570
It's the first track on here so...

89
00:02:55,550 --> 00:02:57,980
This is it.

90
00:02:56,240 --> 00:02:58,720
I still don't know...

91
00:02:57,980 --> 00:03:02,340
I know this! This one already?

92
00:03:02,340 --> 00:03:04,790
Don't you know Tanaka!?

93
00:03:03,780 --> 00:03:05,260
No I don't.

94
00:03:04,790 --> 00:03:06,950
Ma~n! I'll tell you later!

95
00:03:06,420 --> 00:03:07,600

Downtown Boy/ Sano Motoharu

103
00:03:16,360 --> 00:03:25,710
Matsumoto was 18 years old

104
00:03:17,000 --> 00:03:21,060
This used to be the entrance music for Downtown.

105
00:03:20,620 --> 00:03:27,450
Match the rhythm of Marvin Gaye's sad soul ♪

106
00:03:21,060 --> 00:03:23,870
Oh really!? That's nice.

107
00:03:23,870 --> 00:03:26,900
Because it's called "Downtown Boy".

108
00:03:25,630 --> 00:03:32,340
Except I didn't know this song when we made our name "Downtown".

109
00:03:27,450 --> 00:03:33,750
I'm about to lose someone's love in this city again.

110
00:03:32,340 --> 00:03:35,640
I didn't really even know Sano-san that much.

111
00:03:33,750 --> 00:03:36,950
Downtown Boy ♪

112
00:03:35,640 --> 00:03:41,960
But one time someone asked "Are you guys fans of Sano Motoharu?"

113
00:03:41,960 --> 00:03:44,250
Was it Inomoto?

114
00:03:45,450 --> 00:03:49,140
So I found out this song existed and

115
00:03:49,140 --> 00:03:52,600
I decided to make this our entrance music.

116
00:03:52,600 --> 00:03:55,910
Because it matched us nicely.

117
00:03:55,910 --> 00:04:01,910
But the mixer was this stubborn old geaser

118
00:04:01,910 --> 00:04:05,070
and he won't play it unless if you ask him

119
00:04:05,070 --> 00:04:10,820
and go give him a carton of cigarettes or something.

120
00:04:10,910 --> 00:04:12,750
Are you serious?

121
00:04:11,960 --> 00:04:15,010
Won't he play it otherwise!?

122
00:04:14,590 --> 00:04:17,550
That's how it was in the old days.

123
00:04:16,720 --> 00:04:19,880
What? So you have to bribe him?

124
00:04:19,010 --> 00:04:20,980
It's not a bribe!

125
00:04:20,980 --> 00:04:24,060
It's so that he'll do his job happily.

126
00:04:24,510 --> 00:04:28,800
They'd also set the mic too low otherwise.

127
00:04:27,470 --> 00:04:29,800
Whaaat!?

128
00:04:29,800 --> 00:04:33,630
We went to the centre mic and it was way down here.

129
00:04:32,650 --> 00:04:36,840
But that's just being spiteful!

130
00:04:35,760 --> 00:04:38,840
That was common back then.

131
00:04:37,730 --> 00:04:40,670
It's like saying "You're not good enough yet"

132
00:04:39,720 --> 00:04:42,410
We also didn't have a master.

133
00:04:40,740 --> 00:04:45,160
Yeah, that's why we had to take a carton or a bottle.

134
00:04:45,200 --> 00:04:48,010
You had it tough!

135
00:04:46,490 --> 00:04:51,250
But our voices got trained a bit because of that.

136
00:04:48,520 --> 00:04:51,740
Our voices got louder.

137
00:04:51,290 --> 00:04:53,430
Can I go next then?

138
00:04:53,430 --> 00:04:56,240
I've also got Sano-san!

139
00:04:55,480 --> 00:04:58,240
You're gonna continue with Sano-san?

140
00:04:57,530 --> 00:05:00,240
Might as well listen to a different one...

141
00:04:58,420 --> 00:05:02,240
Plus why would you already say, "Sano-san"?

142
00:05:00,940 --> 00:05:03,030
Yeah, "I've also got Sano-san!"

143
00:05:03,030 --> 00:05:05,570
Everything is crumbling apart.

144
00:05:05,570 --> 00:05:08,300
You're a mess!

145
00:05:09,780 --> 00:05:13,850
If you stayed silent we'd been like "Sano-san again!?"

146
00:05:13,850 --> 00:05:17,400
Right, being surprised after listening.

147
00:05:16,930 --> 00:05:20,150
It's something you'd know in your 2nd year.

148
00:05:21,440 --> 00:05:25,820
You'll know in your 2nd year of other jobs too, not just comedy.

149
00:05:25,820 --> 00:05:29,690
This is also the first track.

150
00:05:28,080 --> 00:05:30,280
Oh the first track?

151
00:05:32,570 --> 00:05:34,470
Here it is!

I was in high school.

180

So it was still when Downtown were opening acts and I was a student.

181
00:06:29,820 --> 00:06:33,060
And I was most interested in music while in high school

182
00:06:33,060 --> 00:06:36,690
and in this song you can't tell if he's talking or like...

00:06:36,690 --> 00:06:39,950
♪ Even if it's somebodies trap ♪ Like that.

184
00:06:40,930 --> 00:06:43,760
You're making fun of him aren't you?

185
00:06:42,790 --> 00:06:45,260
No I'm not!

186
00:06:44,710 --> 00:06:48,350
It was quite fresh for its time.

187
00:06:48,350 --> 00:06:51,690
It's right between singing and talking.

188
00:06:51,690 --> 00:06:53,490
Listen to this bit!

189
00:06:53,490 --> 00:06:58,020
In one hand is a jewel, and in the other hand

190
00:06:58,020 --> 00:07:01,260
there is a violent passion beginning to howl ♪

191
00:07:00,050 --> 00:07:02,340
Shut up! I can't hear!

192
00:07:02,380 --> 00:07:04,960
I want to listen but can't hear!

193
00:07:04,960 --> 00:07:06,960
Go Tanaka!

194
00:07:06,100 --> 00:07:08,960
Yes, I...

195
00:07:07,980 --> 00:07:10,100
Tanaka we're entering the highway.

196
00:07:09,230 --> 00:07:11,090
Highway?

197
00:07:10,100 --> 00:07:12,100
Have you got a good one?

198
00:07:11,090 --> 00:07:16,260
I didn't... prepare a song to suit the highway....

199
00:07:14,650 --> 00:07:16,830
Never mind!

200
00:07:17,820 --> 00:07:19,430
9th track.

201
00:07:18,580 --> 00:07:20,450
9th track?

202
00:07:19,430 --> 00:07:22,140
Yes, excuse me, please play it.

203
00:07:25,310 --> 00:07:27,300
Unicorn!

204
00:07:27,300 --> 00:07:29,560
It's Daimeiwaku

205
00:07:28,340 --> 00:07:30,220
Ah right.

206
00:07:28,950 --> 00:07:37,920
1989 April release

207

Daimeiwaku/  Unicorn

208
00:07:28,950 --> 00:07:37,920
Tanaka was 18 years old

209
00:07:29,560 --> 00:07:35,400
This is the song that prompted me to enter this business.

210
00:07:36,480 --> 00:07:38,220
Why?

211
00:07:37,390 --> 00:07:42,810
Well, I went to a design school after finishing high school but

212
00:07:42,810 --> 00:07:47,040
I had to do a massive graduation project

213
00:07:47,040 --> 00:07:49,980
where I had to make heaps of panels and

214
00:07:49,980 --> 00:07:55,760
I was so late at finishing it that they told me I couldn't graduate.

215
00:07:55,760 --> 00:07:59,800
But just around the time I was worried about not graduating,

216
00:07:59,800 --> 00:08:05,190
Endo came back to Osaka from working in Kagawa and

217
00:08:05,190 --> 00:08:09,720
became a part-timer so he'd come to my house everyday

218
00:08:09,740 --> 00:08:15,200
and help me with my project, morning, day and night

219
00:08:15,240 --> 00:08:19,150
for  7 or 10 days.

220
00:08:19,150 --> 00:08:26,120
And thanks to that I somehow made the deadline and graduated.

221
00:08:26,120 --> 00:08:29,860
And the whole time I worked at home I...

222
00:08:29,060 --> 00:08:31,300
Played this song?

223
00:08:29,860 --> 00:08:31,300
Played this song.

224
00:08:31,300 --> 00:08:35,450
Endo worked on that project so much that

225
00:08:35,450 --> 00:08:38,920
I think of it as his work.

226
00:08:38,920 --> 00:08:41,750
He doesn't seem good at that stuff.

227
00:08:40,950 --> 00:08:43,750
I could do it though.

228
00:08:43,750 --> 00:08:46,260
And I graduated, but there was no way

229
00:08:46,280 --> 00:08:49,090
I could get a job if I graduated at that timing.

230
00:08:49,090 --> 00:08:53,220
So then Endo said, "Do you wanna try out comedy together?"

231
00:08:53,220 --> 00:08:56,540
and since Endo worked that hard for me

232
00:08:56,540 --> 00:09:01,870
I decided to answer his call and spent 19 years in this business.

233
00:09:01,870 --> 00:09:04,430
Yeah, this will be our 19th year.

234
00:09:04,430 --> 00:09:07,120
I played this song everyday.

235
00:09:07,120 --> 00:09:10,100
So this makes you remember that?

236
00:09:08,770 --> 00:09:10,880
That's right.

237
00:09:10,100 --> 00:09:13,610
You had always planned to team up with Tanaka right?

238
00:09:12,680 --> 00:09:14,860
Yes I did.

239
00:09:14,860 --> 00:09:17,860
Yamazaki, since you didn't have an episode,

240
00:09:17,860 --> 00:09:20,680
can you stop butting into other peoples'?

241
00:09:20,680 --> 00:09:22,680
Why not?

242
00:09:21,230 --> 00:09:23,700
He comes in from time to time.

243
00:09:26,710 --> 00:09:29,610
This is what it's about!

244
00:09:28,610 --> 00:09:31,720
I really do have a special attachment to this.

245
00:09:31,720 --> 00:09:34,920
Can I go next then?

246
00:09:33,880 --> 00:09:35,760
Oh yes sure.

247
00:09:34,920 --> 00:09:37,880
It's the 12th track.

248
00:09:36,400 --> 00:09:39,020
12th track...?

249
00:09:38,010 --> 00:09:39,990
The 12th track?

250
00:09:39,990 --> 00:09:45,920
So Tanaka said before that I invited him to Osaka

251
00:09:45,920 --> 00:09:49,150
and work together but

252
00:09:49,150 --> 00:09:52,010
this came out the year we started.

253
00:09:51,990 --> 00:09:54,930
It's Nagabuchi-san's album "Japan"

254
00:09:53,940 --> 00:09:56,090
Oh, yes it is.

255
00:09:54,930 --> 00:09:56,540
Yes.

256
00:09:56,540 --> 00:10:00,620
It's called "Tokyo Seishun Asayake Monogatari".

257
00:09:59,250 --> 00:10:01,740
Oh, this is a popular one.

258
00:10:00,620 --> 00:10:01,950
Yes.

259
00:10:00,620 --> 00:10:09,380
1991 December release

260
00:10:00,620 --> 00:10:09,380
Endo was 20 years old

261
00:10:00,620 --> 00:10:09,380
Tokyo Seishun Asayake Monogatari/ Nagabuchi Tsuyoshi

262
00:10:01,980 --> 00:10:05,340
Well it's just as the lyrics say,

263
00:10:05,340 --> 00:10:09,440
"From today, I will become a person of Tokyo♪"

264
00:10:09,440 --> 00:10:13,120
It totally matched us when we came to Tokyo.

265
00:10:13,120 --> 00:10:17,990
Also, at the time I worked part-time at a cafe and

266
00:10:17,990 --> 00:10:22,840
Tanaka worked at a hall in Shibuya but,

267
00:10:22,840 --> 00:10:27,110
I think you all know, he has hairy arms.

268
00:10:26,010 --> 00:10:28,210
Yeah, his arms are bushy as.

269
00:10:27,110 --> 00:10:30,920
Yes, and the third day after he got the job,

270
00:10:30,920 --> 00:10:33,650
a customer complained about his hairy arms

271
00:10:33,650 --> 00:10:36,760
and he got moved to the kitchen.

272
00:10:36,760 --> 00:10:38,760
For real?

273
00:10:37,730 --> 00:10:41,470
Yes, it was like a cafe where girls gather.

274
00:10:41,470 --> 00:10:43,470
It was stylish.

275
00:10:42,530 --> 00:10:44,350
Did they say it was gross?

276
00:10:43,550 --> 00:10:45,010
That's right!

277
00:10:44,350 --> 00:10:46,190
It's not very clean.

278
00:10:46,260 --> 00:10:48,750
I thought, "Tokyo is tough".

279
00:10:48,750 --> 00:10:52,050
And that's when we were listening to this song.

280
00:10:50,060 --> 00:10:52,980
It was the same for us right?

281
00:10:53,870 --> 00:10:56,660
Please play yours Hamada-san.

282
00:10:56,770 --> 00:10:59,440
It's your birthday today right Hamada-san?

283
00:11:00,560 --> 00:11:03,270
It's the 14th track.

284
00:11:01,550 --> 00:11:05,270
Urgh, make it the 1st track you guys!

285
00:11:05,270 --> 00:11:07,810
I wonder what Hamada-san's is?

286
00:11:07,810 --> 00:11:12,300
He's probably planning something unexpected.

287
00:11:12,300 --> 00:11:15,920
No, no, no. They're all cliche songs.

288
00:11:23,510 --> 00:11:26,030
This song is really popular.

289
00:11:24,440 --> 00:11:26,030
Yeah!

290
00:11:28,570 --> 00:11:30,960
It's Morita Kensaku.

291
00:11:30,960 --> 00:11:32,960
Yes, Morita Kensaku's...

292
00:11:32,080 --> 00:11:34,730
"Let's Say Goodbye To Tears"

293
00:11:33,390 --> 00:11:41,980
1971 March release

294
00:11:33,390 --> 00:11:41,980
Hamada was 8 years old

295
00:11:33,390 --> 00:11:41,980
Namida Ni Saraba To Iou/ Morita Kensaku

296
00:11:34,050 --> 00:11:36,610
This was the theme for a drama.

297
00:11:35,150 --> 00:11:37,260
Yep!

298
00:11:36,650 --> 00:11:40,400
We never dreamed that he'd become a governor.

299
00:11:40,400 --> 00:11:43,150
How old were you then Hamada-san?

300
00:11:42,300 --> 00:11:45,520
I was in primary school.....

301
00:11:45,520 --> 00:11:48,410
grade 3 or 4, I think?

302
00:11:47,440 --> 00:11:52,450
Hamada matured faster than us.

303
00:11:51,190 --> 00:11:53,130
Why!?

304
00:11:52,450 --> 00:11:56,900
Because this drama was watched more by

305
00:11:56,900 --> 00:12:01,550
people slightly older than our grade.

306
00:12:01,550 --> 00:12:05,110
So it's normal if you had an older brother or sister but

307
00:12:05,110 --> 00:12:10,440
he was the eldest son and still watched it so

308
00:12:10,440 --> 00:12:13,210
he must have.....

309
00:12:13,210 --> 00:12:15,900
had bushy d#*k hairs.

310
00:12:17,840 --> 00:12:22,390
The day after an episode finished airing, I went to school

311
00:12:22,430 --> 00:12:26,090
and I'd always sing this song with Takasu.

312
00:12:26,090 --> 00:12:28,590
Takasu-san watch it too?

313
00:12:27,550 --> 00:12:29,410
Yeah he did.

314
00:12:28,590 --> 00:12:31,110
Oh, Takasu did too?

315
00:12:29,410 --> 00:12:31,110
Yeah.

316
00:12:31,530 --> 00:12:34,560
We sang it together e~veryday!

317
00:12:33,370 --> 00:12:36,560
My older sister liked it so...

318
00:12:36,560 --> 00:12:40,200
I watched it a fair bit too.

319
00:12:40,390 --> 00:12:42,910
Someone go then.

320
00:12:41,790 --> 00:12:44,350
Oh should we? Can I go then?

321
00:12:43,480 --> 00:12:44,800
Go Yama-chan.

322
00:12:44,350 --> 00:12:46,300
May I?

323
00:12:44,800 --> 00:12:46,090
Yes.

324
00:12:46,760 --> 00:12:49,940
The volume is different depending on the CD.

325
00:12:51,080 --> 00:12:53,220
Don't know it.

326
00:12:57,910 --> 00:13:00,070
What's this?

327
00:12:58,700 --> 00:13:01,490
This was....

328
00:13:01,490 --> 00:13:05,400
my alarm while in high school.

329
00:13:05,400 --> 00:13:07,790
Who is it?

330
00:13:06,480 --> 00:13:09,790
It's a band called X-Ray.

331
00:13:09,790 --> 00:13:12,320
Heavy metal?

332
00:13:12,320 --> 00:13:15,090
You had heavy metal as your alarm?

333
00:13:15,130 --> 00:13:17,820
It was my alarm. Seriously!

334
00:13:17,820 --> 00:13:20,660
What did they say before? Xton?

335
00:13:19,600 --> 00:13:21,310
It's X-Ray

336
00:13:21,310 --> 00:13:24,360
It's a song called "Question" by X-Ray.

337
00:13:23,300 --> 00:13:35,380
1984 Januray release

338
00:13:23,300 --> 00:13:35,380
Yamazaki was 16 years old

339
00:13:23,300 --> 00:13:35,380
question/ X-RAY.

340
00:13:24,360 --> 00:13:26,540
Questio~n!

341
00:13:26,540 --> 00:13:29,100
So they suddenly say "Question"?

342
00:13:31,060 --> 00:13:35,820
Is it just that we don't know who they are or....?

343
00:13:36,060 --> 00:13:38,810
Do only core fans know them?

344
00:13:37,520 --> 00:13:40,590
Well, yes I'd say so.

345
00:13:40,590 --> 00:13:43,340
Heavy metal was very popular then, with

346
00:13:43,340 --> 00:13:50,040
Foreign groups like Michael Schenker Group, Van Halen and Rainbow.

347
00:13:50,040 --> 00:13:56,710
For Japanese metal there was Loudness and Earthshaker and stuff

348
00:13:56,710 --> 00:14:03,030
and there was the young "Kodomo Band" too.

349
00:14:03,350 --> 00:14:06,630
And they're basically a bit.....

350
00:14:06,630 --> 00:14:08,700
Ummm....

351
00:14:07,880 --> 00:14:09,800
It got turned off.

352
00:14:09,570 --> 00:14:11,660
It got turned off quite quickly.

353
00:14:11,660 --> 00:14:13,950
It's too loud.

354
00:14:13,950 --> 00:14:16,830
Questio~n!

355
00:14:14,670 --> 00:14:16,830
Questio~n♪

356
00:14:16,830 --> 00:14:20,080
Why did you make this your alarm?

357
00:14:19,280 --> 00:14:21,480
I was bad at waking up.

358
00:14:21,480 --> 00:14:24,590
I think it was 6:40am, it goes,

359
00:14:24,590 --> 00:14:26,590
QUESTIO~N!

360
00:14:30,280 --> 00:14:31,910
Oh really.

361
00:14:31,910 --> 00:14:35,270
Well I suppose you'd have an attachment to it then...

362
00:14:35,270 --> 00:14:38,640
Right, he listened to it every morning!

363
00:14:38,640 --> 00:14:42,380
Your mother must have been worried. QUESTIO~N!

364
00:14:42,380 --> 00:14:44,960
"What's that boy doing?"

365
00:14:44,960 --> 00:14:47,500
That's the real question.

366
00:14:48,070 --> 00:14:50,380
Okay, Tanaka.

367
00:14:49,530 --> 00:14:52,380
Yes. This was a bit of a....

368
00:14:52,380 --> 00:14:58,340
shock to me and it's a song choice related with my dad.

369
00:14:58,340 --> 00:15:03,240
It's not something I listened for my own liking.

370
00:15:13,860 --> 00:15:15,450
Don't you know it yet?

371
00:15:14,960 --> 00:15:17,020
We know it right?

372
00:15:15,730 --> 00:15:18,100
Yeah.

373
00:15:17,120 --> 00:15:19,240
Listen a bit longer.

374
00:15:19,750 --> 00:15:22,690
It's Atsumi Jirou right?

375
00:15:21,970 --> 00:15:24,720
Yes! It's "Yumeoi zake".

376
00:15:24,000 --> 00:15:34,360
1978 February release

377
00:15:24,000 --> 00:15:34,360
Tanaka was 6 years old.

378
00:15:24,000 --> 00:15:34,360
Yumeoi-zake/ Atsumi Jirou

379
00:15:27,570 --> 00:15:32,460
My dad really loved this record and

380
00:15:32,460 --> 00:15:37,010
would always play it at home and make me listen as a kid.

381
00:15:37,010 --> 00:15:41,430
Anyway, once every year at the summer festival

382
00:15:41,430 --> 00:15:44,650
we'd have a karaoke contest in the neighborhood

383
00:15:44,650 --> 00:15:48,600
and usually we'd have it at a spacious park but

384
00:15:48,600 --> 00:15:53,530
it was raining, and so, because we lived near a highway

385
00:15:53,530 --> 00:15:58,230
we had the contest under an overhead road.

386
00:15:58,230 --> 00:16:00,230
We did it every year right?

387
00:15:59,030 --> 00:16:01,060
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

388
00:16:00,230 --> 00:16:03,580
And my dad was intent on singing this so

389
00:16:03,580 --> 00:16:06,230
he practiced all the time at home.

390
00:16:06,230 --> 00:16:10,330
So the contest started but he still wasn't any good.

391
00:16:10,330 --> 00:16:15,130
And I was watching this as a kid but...

392
00:16:15,220 --> 00:16:18,940
when he was nearly finished singing,

393
00:16:18,940 --> 00:16:21,920
another drunk person there yelled

394
00:16:21,920 --> 00:16:24,250
"You suck!" or something.

395
00:16:24,250 --> 00:16:30,530
It was the first time seeing my dad get harassed

396
00:16:30,530 --> 00:16:33,140
so it was a huge shock!

397
00:16:33,140 --> 00:16:37,750
Because he used to be like an absolute power.

398
00:16:34,980 --> 00:16:38,070
Well yeah, that's right.

399
00:16:37,750 --> 00:16:41,640
But that dad was getting yelled "You suck~!"

400
00:16:40,580 --> 00:16:42,780
After practicing that much.

401
00:16:41,640 --> 00:16:47,120
He practiced so hard, so it was a shock.

402
00:16:47,120 --> 00:16:52,980
But I often remember the rain and other distinct details

403
00:16:52,980 --> 00:16:58,380
from that time when I hear this song or when it's raining.

404
00:16:58,840 --> 00:17:01,080
Thank you.

405
00:17:00,130 --> 00:17:03,390
This is my trauma song.

406
00:17:02,630 --> 00:17:04,720
Well okay.

407
00:17:04,720 --> 00:17:07,900
I think this is from the same year as you, Downtown.

408
00:17:07,900 --> 00:17:13,170
When I was in high school, all I did was baseball and...

409
00:17:11,770 --> 00:17:14,290
This is your trauma song right?

410
00:17:13,170 --> 00:17:14,730
Yes.

411
00:17:16,230 --> 00:17:20,000
Ohhh! No this is 1 or 2 years before us.

412
00:17:19,600 --> 00:17:21,540
Before?

413
00:17:19,960 --> 00:17:21,540
Yep.

414
00:17:22,690 --> 00:17:24,020
I know it.

415
00:17:23,430 --> 00:17:25,520
Right?

416
00:17:24,020 --> 00:17:26,020
Yes I do.

417
00:17:26,470 --> 00:17:28,800
It became really popular.

418
00:17:27,530 --> 00:17:29,900
It's "Take A Chance" right?

419
00:17:28,800 --> 00:17:32,970
"Namida no Take A Chance" and we were in 1st grade of junior high

420
00:17:29,840 --> 00:17:37,090
1984 December release

421
00:17:29,840 --> 00:17:37,090
Namida no Take A Chance/ Kazami Shingo

422
00:17:29,840 --> 00:17:37,090
Endo was 13 years old

423
00:17:32,970 --> 00:17:37,520
and break dancing became very popular because of this song.

424
00:17:37,520 --> 00:17:41,410
Anyway, all I did was baseball ever since primary school

425
00:17:41,410 --> 00:17:46,490
and the only other thing I decided to try a little bit was

426
00:17:46,490 --> 00:17:49,700
break dancing to this song.

427
00:17:49,700 --> 00:17:55,290
There's a bit in the song where Kazami Shingo break dances but

428
00:17:55,290 --> 00:18:00,090
I fully copied that and danced my hardest in front of everyone

429
00:18:00,090 --> 00:18:03,750
but they just erupted in laughter.

430
00:18:03,750 --> 00:18:06,780
They said "What'cha doing En-chan?"

431
00:18:06,780 --> 00:18:10,540
Even the girl I liked was pointing and laughing at me.

432
00:18:10,540 --> 00:18:13,000
It was really traumatic for me and

433
00:18:13,000 --> 00:18:15,810
after that I delved even deeper into baseball.

434
00:18:15,810 --> 00:18:20,190
This song made me not want to like anything other than baseball.

435
00:18:20,190 --> 00:18:22,880
That would be traumatic!

436
00:18:21,710 --> 00:18:24,060
It was very traumatic!

437
00:18:22,900 --> 00:18:25,580
Nobody would've done it back then.

438
00:18:24,270 --> 00:18:28,990
No. It was a period when I wanted to seem cool.

439
00:18:29,650 --> 00:18:32,840
I might have been laughed at the most in my life then.

440
00:18:32,840 --> 00:18:36,100
Even compared to when you tried to make them laugh.

441
00:18:35,040 --> 00:18:37,160
Even after becoming a comedian.

442
00:18:36,100 --> 00:18:40,390
Yes. Nothing tops that sadness and humiliation.

443
00:18:40,880 --> 00:18:44,140
Can I play this one then?

444
00:18:44,140 --> 00:18:48,200
This might be the song I've listened to most in my life.

445
00:18:48,200 --> 00:18:54,250
This is sort of has the roots of a comedian.

446
00:19:00,640 --> 00:19:03,880
Can I play this one then?

447
00:19:03,880 --> 00:19:08,280
This might be the song I've listened to most in my life.

448
00:19:08,280 --> 00:19:13,500
This sort of has the roots of a comedian.

This is a good one.

450
00:19:24,590 --> 00:19:28,930
Oh man, this'll make me cry.

451
00:19:28,040 --> 00:19:30,390
This is good right?

452
00:19:28,950 --> 00:19:30,390
Yes.

453
00:19:30,390 --> 00:19:33,220
I listen to this a lot.

I'm not sure if that or the song came first,

481
00:20:50,270 --> 00:20:54,970
I think the song came first and they decided to make a film about it.

then I can become a clown for you.

486
00:20:59,120 --> 00:21:02,370
It was a movie about a clown right?

487
00:21:00,830 --> 00:21:03,310
Yes, yes, yes.

488
00:21:02,420 --> 00:21:06,220

518
00:22:46,100 --> 00:22:48,100
Yeah we sang it together.

519
00:22:50,670 --> 00:22:53,380
Is this your first song?

520
00:22:52,730 --> 00:22:57,550
There's lots of songs we sing alone in the album but

521
00:22:57,550 --> 00:23:02,560
this is the only one we sing together that I like.

522
00:23:03,730 --> 00:23:06,370
This is nice.

523
00:23:05,630 --> 00:23:08,370
This is very valuable!

524
00:23:09,400 --> 00:23:13,080
They once had a concert and

525
00:23:13,080 --> 00:23:16,800
they got so happy that

526
00:23:16,800 --> 00:23:20,800
that they even hugged, but afterwards backstage....

527
00:23:20,800 --> 00:23:24,780
No, we went straight to my room to change because

528
00:23:24,780 --> 00:23:27,760
I was renting a room near that hall back then.

529
00:23:27,760 --> 00:23:31,190
We left from the back because the audience would rush to us.

530
00:23:31,190 --> 00:23:34,210
So we basically went into my room

531
00:23:34,210 --> 00:23:38,280
and straight after that he did a massive shit.

532
00:23:38,280 --> 00:23:41,450
And he didn't flush it away.

533
00:23:39,860 --> 00:23:42,440
I flushed it!

534
00:23:42,440 --> 00:23:46,380
We were hugging emotionally just a few minutes ago.

535
00:23:49,160 --> 00:23:52,840
I might forgive him doing a poo

536
00:23:52,840 --> 00:23:54,680
since it's a natural occurrence.

537
00:23:54,680 --> 00:23:57,490
But not flushing it? He fails as a human being.
