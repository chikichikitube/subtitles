1
00:00:00,410 --> 00:00:02,870
The First Annual Gaki no Tsukai ya Arahende, Chiki Chiki

2
00:00:02,870 --> 00:00:05,150
Common sense test!

3
00:00:05,150 --> 00:00:07,690
Endo Dokkiri (prank) Quiz~!!

4
00:00:10,970 --> 00:00:12,630
So for today's topic...

5
00:00:12,630 --> 00:00:14,720
before we actually explain it,

6
00:00:14,720 --> 00:00:18,870
maybe it's better to have a look at this VTR first

7
00:00:18,870 --> 00:00:21,160
Roman Holiday (Degawa's favorite movie)

8
00:00:21,160 --> 00:00:25,950
The incident happened during "100 Questions Degawa Tetsuro"

9
00:00:25,950 --> 00:00:28,120
(he must be lying about it)

10
00:00:29,180 --> 00:00:32,170
Who is the person that Degawa admires?

11
00:00:32,170 --> 00:00:35,160
Eh, who could it be...

12
00:00:36,490 --> 00:00:44,660
Please keep an eye on the conversation between Endo and Matsumoto for this question

13
00:00:44,760 --> 00:00:46,520
Please show your answers

14
00:00:46,520 --> 00:00:53,420
Dad

15
00:00:46,520 --> 00:00:53,420
Helen Keller

16
00:00:46,520 --> 00:00:53,420
Mr Shimura

17
00:00:46,520 --> 00:00:53,420
Mr Takeshi

18
00:00:46,520 --> 00:00:53,420
Nagashima

19
00:00:46,520 --> 00:00:53,420
Shigeo

20
00:00:48,720 --> 00:00:49,420
So that's how it is

21
00:00:49,420 --> 00:00:51,420
What's about Helen Keller!!

22
00:00:51,420 --> 00:00:53,420
Helen Keller is true for everyone right

23
00:00:53,420 --> 00:00:56,720
She's a top 5 for everyone right

24
00:00:56,720 --> 00:00:59,540
(She's definitely an admirable person)

25
00:00:56,720 --> 00:00:59,540
Not on my list though...

26
00:00:59,540 --> 00:01:00,480
Eh, not on your list?

27
00:01:00,480 --> 00:01:01,500
Yeah. sorry it's not

28
00:01:01,500 --> 00:01:02,270
What's her rank?

29
00:01:02,270 --> 00:01:03,370
Not even top 100

30
00:01:03,370 --> 00:01:04,230
Are you serious man?

31
00:01:04,230 --> 00:01:06,230
Learn more about Helen Keller dude

32
00:01:06,230 --> 00:01:06,990
She's awesome

33
00:01:06,990 --> 00:01:10,530
Helen Keller...yeah definitely awesome though...

34
00:01:10,530 --> 00:01:12,690
Teacher Sullivan is awesome too

35
00:01:12,690 --> 00:01:14,570
well yeah, but not on my list too

36
00:01:15,360 --> 00:01:18,820
It seems like a casual conversation at first glance

37
00:01:18,820 --> 00:01:22,820
Hosei did not miss out the sense of incongruity here

38
00:01:22,820 --> 00:01:23,890
Yeah right

39
00:01:26,210 --> 00:01:28,580
During the break time from filming,

40
00:01:28,580 --> 00:01:31,990
this sense of incongruity is assured

41
00:01:33,070 --> 00:01:38,680
Hosei: Helen Keller...     Matsumoto: Helen Keller...

42
00:01:38,680 --> 00:01:42,150
Endo also knows about Helen Keller right?

43
00:01:42,150 --> 00:01:44,380
Helen Keller right...

44
00:01:44,380 --> 00:01:45,430
You don't know right?

45
00:01:45,430 --> 00:01:48,490
Someone with superpower...

46
00:01:48,490 --> 00:01:50,020
No, no way, really...

47
00:01:50,430 --> 00:01:54,140
That's Uri Geller!!

48
00:01:54,140 --> 00:01:55,240
That was close

49
00:01:55,240 --> 00:01:57,690
I actually wanted to ask this back then

50
00:01:57,690 --> 00:02:00,900
So he didn't get it when you say Teacher Sullivan

51
00:02:00,900 --> 00:02:03,960
His face was like "what on earth are you talking about"

52
00:02:05,270 --> 00:02:08,010
A doctor?

53
00:02:08,010 --> 00:02:11,070
A nurse?

54
00:02:11,070 --> 00:02:15,820
No, you're mixing up with Nightingale

55
00:02:15,820 --> 00:02:18,080
Not a nurse!!

56
00:02:18,080 --> 00:02:19,440
You know it's man or woman right?

57
00:02:19,440 --> 00:02:23,060
A man...

58
00:02:23,060 --> 00:02:27,220
Don't miss it when there's a 1/2 chance man

59
00:02:32,060 --> 00:02:35,470
He got tricked by Uri Geller!!

60
00:02:35,470 --> 00:02:37,850
Yeah, Geller is a man...

61
00:02:41,490 --> 00:02:47,200
You answered it seamlessly only to find out it was wrong

62
00:02:47,200 --> 00:02:50,410
I see, this happened in previous episodes

63
00:02:50,410 --> 00:02:52,620
It does feel strange when you watch it again

64
00:02:52,620 --> 00:02:55,680
He probably even thought that it's my Boke (Gag)

65
00:02:57,550 --> 00:03:01,010
Yeah, he thought it's a Boke to answer that for an admirable person

66
00:03:01,010 --> 00:03:02,060
Taking it further,

67
00:03:02,060 --> 00:03:07,380
He probably thinks Matsumoto-san is having a dull moment

68
00:03:05,280 --> 00:03:07,380
That's the worst

69
00:03:07,380 --> 00:03:09,380
So for this time,

70
00:03:09,380 --> 00:03:16,440
Actually all of our members did the 100 questions series

71
00:03:16,440 --> 00:03:19,460
Except Endo

72
00:03:19,460 --> 00:03:20,630
Didn't he?

73
00:03:20,630 --> 00:03:24,410
So we thought about letting Endo to do it

74
00:03:24,410 --> 00:03:26,350
Just to find out what do he even know

75
00:03:26,350 --> 00:03:31,790
Using the 100 questions series as a camouflage

76
00:03:31,790 --> 00:03:35,640
to test out Endo's academic ability with some common sense questions

77
00:03:35,640 --> 00:03:37,170
The quiz will be easy right?

78
00:03:37,170 --> 00:03:38,510
Very easy

79
00:03:38,510 --> 00:03:39,950
Just common sense questions

80
00:03:39,950 --> 00:03:43,690
Let's have a look at Endo on the other side

81
00:03:46,290 --> 00:03:47,650
He always make that movement

82
00:03:47,650 --> 00:03:50,740
Yeah yeah, he always do this

83
00:03:50,740 --> 00:03:52,740
-Please wait a moment     -Ok

84
00:03:53,750 --> 00:03:56,160
He won't hear the sound in our studio

85
00:03:58,160 --> 00:03:59,360
He looks stupid

86
00:03:59,360 --> 00:04:01,110
Long time since you said stupid

87
00:04:01,110 --> 00:04:04,310
The way he wear the t-shirt is just stupid

88
00:04:19,510 --> 00:04:23,310
100 questions have been prepared from various genres

89
00:04:23,310 --> 00:04:29,080
to test out Endo's common sense ability

90
00:04:29,080 --> 00:04:31,730
well this have some really good questions

91
00:04:31,730 --> 00:04:35,890
-but the first question seems difficult     -Yeah, it is

92
00:04:35,890 --> 00:04:38,170
so questions like the second one sounds good

93
00:04:38,170 --> 00:04:38,810
Yes

94
00:04:38,810 --> 00:04:44,780
Answer an idiom similar to "Even Homer sometimes nods"

95
00:04:44,780 --> 00:04:47,090
I believe it's not that difficult right

96
00:04:47,090 --> 00:04:49,190
So if everyone agrees, then let's start

97
00:04:50,080 --> 00:04:56,840
Can you tell us an idiom similar to "Even Homer sometimes nods"?

98
00:04:50,080 --> 00:04:56,840
The original phrase "弘法にも筆の誤り" refers to
Kōbō-Daishi, the grand master who propagated
the buddhist teaching as well as a famous Japanese
calligrapher, may also make writing mistakes.

99
00:04:57,640 --> 00:04:58,790
Eh?

100
00:04:58,790 --> 00:05:00,240
It's a bit...

101
00:05:00,720 --> 00:05:03,040
It's too difficult all of a sudden

102
00:05:00,720 --> 00:05:03,040
Ye...yes, eh?

103
00:05:03,040 --> 00:05:08,080
Can you tell us an idiom similar to "Even Homer sometimes nods"?

104
00:05:04,980 --> 00:05:06,690
Should have asked the first question

105
00:05:08,080 --> 00:05:09,850
Yeah we should

106
00:05:09,850 --> 00:05:11,780
He looks completely clueless

107
00:05:11,780 --> 00:05:13,600
He's like "what are you talking about?"

108
00:05:13,600 --> 00:05:16,050
He must be shocked

109
00:05:16,670 --> 00:05:19,060
Monkeys also fall from trees

110
00:05:19,060 --> 00:05:21,800
How come he knows the answer? What's happening?

111
00:05:21,800 --> 00:05:23,200
Why did you ask that?

112
00:05:23,200 --> 00:05:24,160
You knew the answer?

113
00:05:24,160 --> 00:05:25,080
For the idiom?

114
00:05:25,080 --> 00:05:25,430
Yes

115
00:05:26,910 --> 00:05:30,390
It means even the most skilled, can make a mistake right?

116
00:05:31,800 --> 00:05:35,530
He's starting to look smart now

117
00:05:36,330 --> 00:05:38,400
The screen will change when this is pressed

118
00:05:39,640 --> 00:05:40,750
He answered it

119
00:05:40,750 --> 00:05:43,550
He's probably in doubt with the question

120
00:05:43,550 --> 00:05:47,030
Yeah, he's like why are you asking this?

121
00:05:47,030 --> 00:05:49,900
We have to ask some usual questions

122
00:05:49,900 --> 00:05:52,120
Ask him what's your favorite road?

123
00:05:52,540 --> 00:05:56,700
What is your favorite street?

124
00:05:56,700 --> 00:05:58,890
We've all been asked about this

125
00:05:58,890 --> 00:06:01,840
It's Meguro-dori (dori=street)

126
00:06:01,840 --> 00:06:05,130
It somehow sounds stupid

127
00:06:05,130 --> 00:06:08,950
He's like "it's coming, it's coming"

128
00:06:08,950 --> 00:06:11,850
yeah like "this is it, this is it"

129
00:06:12,010 --> 00:06:13,750
We shall start again for the next question

130
00:06:13,750 --> 00:06:15,900
Then what about asking this question?

131
00:06:15,900 --> 00:06:19,020
Yeah, we do want him to answer this

132
00:06:19,490 --> 00:06:21,820
It's common sense, it's a good question

133
00:06:21,990 --> 00:06:28,670
Can you tell us the name of Sunday to Saturday in English?

134
00:06:28,930 --> 00:06:31,020
From Sunday in English?

135
00:06:31,020 --> 00:06:34,000
He's in doubt that he's being quizzed right?

136
00:06:46,160 --> 00:06:50,090
What? He's able to answer it isn't he?

137
00:06:50,090 --> 00:06:53,930
He's seems to be smarter than we thought?

138
00:06:54,790 --> 00:07:01,300
Endo's common sense ability is completely underestimated

139
00:06:58,710 --> 00:07:01,300
He can answer, he definitely can

140
00:07:01,300 --> 00:07:06,640
We've probably just thought Endo to be too stupid

141
00:07:06,640 --> 00:07:07,960
No, no, no way

142
00:07:07,960 --> 00:07:11,660
After that, Endo continues to...

143
00:07:07,960 --> 00:07:11,660
Do you know the meaning of "ginger" in "ginger ale"?

144
00:07:11,660 --> 00:07:14,030
Well...it's Ginger (生姜)

145
00:07:14,030 --> 00:07:17,820
...answer the questions correctly

146
00:07:17,820 --> 00:07:21,790
Can you tell us who is "Itō Hirobumi"?

147
00:07:17,820 --> 00:07:21,790
The first Prime Minister of Japan

148
00:07:21,790 --> 00:07:23,570
What is happening here?

149
00:07:23,570 --> 00:07:26,420
There's already no more questions for today

150
00:07:26,420 --> 00:07:30,120
If this continues, today's show will be ruined,

151
00:07:30,120 --> 00:07:35,130
so what about asking questions from a different angle

152
00:07:35,490 --> 00:07:37,920
Fake questions

153
00:07:38,700 --> 00:07:41,070
People should normally notice this though...

154
00:07:41,070 --> 00:07:44,040
Mixing questions into the common sense quiz

155
00:07:44,040 --> 00:07:47,510
which are totally fake and non-sense

156
00:07:47,510 --> 00:07:52,850
what kind of reactions will Endo show us!?

157
00:07:52,850 --> 00:07:57,000
"Rashōmon" and "Ginga Tetsudō no Yoru"
are actually NOT written by Natsume Soseki

158
00:07:52,850 --> 00:07:57,000
What is the famous novel written by Natsume Soseki, other than "Rashōmon" and "Ginga Tetsudō no Yoru"?

159
00:07:57,000 --> 00:08:00,040
Botchan is one of the most famous novel in Japan, read by many Japanese during their school years

160
00:07:57,000 --> 00:08:00,040
He'll probably end this by answering Botchan

161
00:08:00,040 --> 00:08:01,680
That's the worst

162
00:08:01,680 --> 00:08:02,830
Question number 55

163
00:08:03,920 --> 00:08:15,710
What is the famous novel written by Natsume Soseki, other than "Rashōmon" and "Ginga Tetsudō no Yoru"?

164
00:08:15,710 --> 00:08:16,640
Look, I told you

165
00:08:16,640 --> 00:08:19,630
-Who is it again?     -Natsume Soseki

166
00:08:19,630 --> 00:08:20,310
Ehhh?

167
00:08:23,890 --> 00:08:25,810
He didn't even notice it's fake

168
00:08:25,810 --> 00:08:27,320
You normally should though

169
00:08:27,730 --> 00:08:29,660
Botchan

170
00:08:31,000 --> 00:08:34,460
This is it!!

171
00:08:35,730 --> 00:08:39,600
No Endo, that's not the main point

172
00:08:39,600 --> 00:08:42,540
His answer Botchan was just as we predicted

173
00:08:42,540 --> 00:08:47,140
There's a connection here between Natsume Soseki and Botchan, but not the other ones...

174
00:08:47,140 --> 00:08:50,400
There's so many this kind of questions isn't it?

175
00:08:51,780 --> 00:08:53,920
He's still in doubt of it...

176
00:08:53,920 --> 00:08:55,450
Should it be like this?

177
00:08:55,450 --> 00:08:58,220
-He can't spell alphabets     -I think so too

178
00:08:58,220 --> 00:08:59,710
Really?

179
00:08:59,710 --> 00:09:01,710
Well yeah, he was like that before

180
00:09:02,550 --> 00:09:07,890
He wasn't able to spell "三權分立 (Separation of powers)" before right?

181
00:09:07,890 --> 00:09:10,900
What about the Citizenship Obligations? The three obligations

182
00:09:10,900 --> 00:09:14,280
That's in question number 15

183
00:09:14,280 --> 00:09:15,140
Question 15 please

184
00:09:15,140 --> 00:09:20,940
Can you tell us, what are the three Citizenship Obligations?

185
00:09:20,940 --> 00:09:26,320
I've actually answered this in the previous episodes of Gaki no Tsukai

186
00:09:26,320 --> 00:09:26,920
Yes you did

187
00:09:26,920 --> 00:09:27,870
I'll answer it then

188
00:09:30,530 --> 00:09:32,710
Compulsory education

189
00:09:35,810 --> 00:09:37,630
Taxation

190
00:09:42,210 --> 00:09:54,310
Eduction, taxation...

191
00:09:52,990 --> 00:09:54,310
Eat?

192
00:09:56,130 --> 00:09:58,820
Hey you did it before right!

193
00:09:58,820 --> 00:10:01,420
-It pops up sometimes     -Yeah

194
00:10:01,420 --> 00:10:04,290
Good answers pop up sometimes

195
00:10:05,600 --> 00:10:09,260
And that's why we can't stop doing this

196
00:10:09,260 --> 00:10:13,200
So citizens can't be on a diet

197
00:10:13,200 --> 00:10:13,910
Yeah indeed

198
00:10:13,910 --> 00:10:16,600
How about question 9

199
00:10:16,600 --> 00:10:20,270
-Ahh sounds good     -Then let's go for it

200
00:10:20,270 --> 00:10:26,740
Can you tell us the 3 requirements essential for Photosynthesis to occur?

201
00:10:36,240 --> 00:10:46,030
Sunlight

202
00:10:41,150 --> 00:10:46,030
Carbon dioxide

203
00:10:44,930 --> 00:10:46,030
Starch

204
00:10:47,440 --> 00:10:51,930
Starch? Potatoes?

205
00:10:55,620 --> 00:10:57,580
Starch...Starch...

206
00:10:57,580 --> 00:10:59,070
Starch is in it right?

207
00:10:59,070 --> 00:11:01,420
Starch is in it right??

208
00:11:01,420 --> 00:11:04,380
Starch is in it right?

209
00:11:04,990 --> 00:11:08,610
Yeah starch is in it, of course starch is in it...

210
00:11:08,610 --> 00:11:11,130
Well yeah, it's this kind of questions

211
00:11:11,130 --> 00:11:11,800
I see

212
00:11:11,800 --> 00:11:15,460
Well he's just being truthful...just truthful

213
00:11:15,460 --> 00:11:17,360
That's all

214
00:11:17,360 --> 00:11:21,300
What about questions like the top 3 beauties or the top 3 delicacies

215
00:11:21,300 --> 00:11:24,700
He doesn't seems to know the top 3 delicacies...

216
00:11:24,700 --> 00:11:31,470
Can you tell us the world's top 3 delicacies?

217
00:11:34,320 --> 00:11:36,330
Foie gras

218
00:11:36,330 --> 00:11:41,090
"Triffles", "Troffles", "Treffles"

219
00:11:41,090 --> 00:11:42,250
Caviar

220
00:11:42,250 --> 00:11:44,090
Foie gras, "Troffles", Caviar

221
00:11:45,180 --> 00:11:47,890
He said it's "Troffles"

222
00:11:48,410 --> 00:11:54,160
Foie gras, Tri...Troffles, Ca...Caviar

223
00:11:54,160 --> 00:12:00,860
He've been pronouncing it ambiguously on purpose for all this time

224
00:12:00,860 --> 00:12:02,610
This is how he goes on with life

225
00:12:02,610 --> 00:12:04,170
He've never eaten it before?

226
00:12:04,170 --> 00:12:06,150
Should we add some normal questions?

227
00:12:06,150 --> 00:12:09,080
Ah, so the usual questions. What should we ask...

228
00:12:09,080 --> 00:12:10,760
What about his nicknames?

229
00:12:10,760 --> 00:12:13,270
Like his nickname during primary school?

230
00:12:13,270 --> 00:12:16,730
Won't he say it's advantageous for Tanaka?

231
00:12:16,740 --> 00:12:20,920
Do he still thinks it's 100 questions?

232
00:12:20,920 --> 00:12:23,570
That's being stupid too though

233
00:12:23,590 --> 00:12:29,180
What is your nickname during primary school?

234
00:12:29,180 --> 00:12:31,180
It's En-chan

235
00:12:32,800 --> 00:12:38,170
-He must be thinking someone is answering it     -Yes, he definitely is

236
00:12:38,170 --> 00:12:42,410
I thought 100 questions series should be asking these kind of questions

237
00:12:42,410 --> 00:12:44,450
He's looking for these questions too

238
00:12:44,450 --> 00:12:47,520
He must know how to calculate the area of a triangle right?

239
00:12:47,520 --> 00:12:50,560
I feel worried about his maths

240
00:12:50,560 --> 00:12:51,900
-Really?     -I bet he don't know

241
00:12:51,900 --> 00:12:53,390
Let's have a try

242
00:12:53,390 --> 00:12:55,670
Maths question number 8

243
00:12:55,670 --> 00:13:05,490
Can you tell us the equation to calculate the area of a triangle?

244
00:13:05,490 --> 00:13:07,500
Base times height divided by 2

245
00:13:09,180 --> 00:13:11,510
Why is he talking like that?

246
00:13:11,510 --> 00:13:14,550
I feel really pissed off

247
00:13:16,570 --> 00:13:19,010
Answering it all of a sudden

248
00:13:19,010 --> 00:13:22,250
It suddenly came to his mind isn't it

249
00:13:22,250 --> 00:13:27,100
I think he won't know the area of a Trapezoid

250
00:13:27,100 --> 00:13:29,060
I bet he won't know about Trapezoid

251
00:13:29,060 --> 00:13:30,590
You're such a bad guy

252
00:13:30,910 --> 00:13:33,050
Please ask him the area of a Trapezoid

253
00:13:33,130 --> 00:13:40,800
Can you tell us the equation to calculate the area of a trapezoid?

254
00:13:43,130 --> 00:13:46,130
I don't really know what is a Trapezoid though

255
00:13:46,130 --> 00:13:49,080
What shape is Trapezoid?

256
00:13:49,080 --> 00:13:54,280
If you don't know the shape of a Trapezoid then that's the end of the story

257
00:13:54,280 --> 00:13:57,420
Yeah it'll be impossible to tell the area for sure

258
00:13:58,220 --> 00:13:59,420
It's just impossible

259
00:13:59,960 --> 00:14:03,820
BASE    x

260
00:14:02,270 --> 00:14:03,820
HEIGHT  ÷

261
00:14:02,680 --> 00:14:03,820
3

262
00:14:06,220 --> 00:14:11,970
More and more questions coming up!!

263
00:14:11,970 --> 00:14:14,360
What about asking the same question again?

264
00:14:14,360 --> 00:14:21,060
What is the famous novel written by Natsume Soseki, other than "Rashōmon" and "Ginga Tetsudō no Yoru"?

265
00:14:21,060 --> 00:14:24,360
Then get him to tell an answer other than Botchan

266
00:14:24,360 --> 00:14:28,650
and hopefully he would say "wait a second, after all..."

267
00:14:28,650 --> 00:14:32,350
No, he won't say that, we just tested that

268
00:14:32,350 --> 00:14:38,390
Other than "Ginga Tetsudō no Yoru" and "Botchan", what is another famous novel written by Natsume Soseki

269
00:14:38,390 --> 00:14:40,750
I see I see, that sounds good

270
00:14:40,750 --> 00:14:53,110
What is the famous novel written by Natsume Soseki, other than "Ginga Tetsudō no Yoru" and "Botchan"?

271
00:14:56,730 --> 00:14:59,660
I've said it's Botchan just now right?

272
00:14:59,660 --> 00:15:03,420
-Other than Botchan     -Other than Botchan?

273
00:15:04,260 --> 00:15:07,200
-Ginga Tetsudō no Yoru...     -He's noticing it right

274
00:15:07,200 --> 00:15:09,970
...Botchan, and another one?

275
00:15:10,660 --> 00:15:12,430
Come on, notice it man

276
00:15:13,290 --> 00:15:15,060
Eh, what is it again?

277
00:15:15,060 --> 00:15:17,060
What is this guy struggling with?

278
00:15:18,760 --> 00:15:21,330
Ask him are you thinking about "Rashōmon"?

279
00:15:22,260 --> 00:15:23,460
I think I've got it

280
00:15:24,500 --> 00:15:26,420
I Am a Cat

281
00:15:29,770 --> 00:15:32,080
Here it comes, a classic one from Natsume Soseki

282
00:15:32,080 --> 00:15:37,530
Eh, Natsume Soseki?

283
00:15:37,530 --> 00:15:42,000
-Ginga Tetsudō no Yoru     -Wow, it's coming, it's coming

284
00:15:42,000 --> 00:15:45,860
I Am a Cat, Botchan, yeah it's right

285
00:15:45,860 --> 00:15:48,500
He just said it's right

286
00:15:48,500 --> 00:15:54,200
Ginga Tetsudō has completely chugged out of the station

287
00:15:48,500 --> 00:15:54,200
Ginga Tetsudō translates to Galactic Railroad,
it's basically a metaphor to describe that
Endo is going completely wrong

288
00:15:54,200 --> 00:15:56,270
There's no way to stop anymore

289
00:15:56,270 --> 00:15:59,000
There's no terminal stations

290
00:15:59,000 --> 00:16:01,240
He drank water

291
00:16:01,240 --> 00:16:02,470
Let's go for some usual questions?

292
00:16:02,470 --> 00:16:04,910
Let's go for some usual questions

293
00:16:04,910 --> 00:16:10,270
What's the most abnormal sex experience you have had?

294
00:16:10,270 --> 00:16:14,590
Well yeah, this is going to a bonus chance for him

295
00:16:14,590 --> 00:16:16,270
Don't know will it be aired though

296
00:16:16,270 --> 00:16:24,090
What's the most abnormal sex experience you have had?

297
00:16:24,090 --> 00:16:25,130
He's laughing

298
00:16:28,420 --> 00:16:31,770
With a women...

299
00:16:31,770 --> 00:16:38,290
We both wore a helmet for motorbikes...

300
00:16:38,290 --> 00:16:39,700
and did those things

301
00:16:43,650 --> 00:16:48,230
What a fool

302
00:16:48,230 --> 00:16:51,420
Both of them wore a helmet...

303
00:16:51,420 --> 00:16:55,530
What about this, the world's six continents

304
00:16:55,530 --> 00:16:58,160
I feel worried

305
00:16:58,160 --> 00:17:01,140
Maybe start by asking him how many continents are there

306
00:17:01,140 --> 00:17:02,330
Then you can't mention 6

307
00:17:02,330 --> 00:17:07,480
Ask him to name all of the continents on earth

308
00:17:07,480 --> 00:17:15,120
Can you name all of the continents on earth?

309
00:17:19,400 --> 00:17:24,500
Eurasia continent

310
00:17:24,500 --> 00:17:27,590
Africa continent

311
00:17:27,590 --> 00:17:31,800
Antarctica continent

312
00:17:43,240 --> 00:17:46,560
Oceania continent

313
00:17:56,830 --> 00:17:57,820
Awesome

314
00:18:00,770 --> 00:18:04,410
America continent

315
00:18:07,420 --> 00:18:08,920
Brazil continent

316
00:18:13,880 --> 00:18:16,650
That was awful

317
00:18:16,650 --> 00:18:19,180
Ask him to answer it again

318
00:18:19,180 --> 00:18:21,450
-One more time please     -Ehh

319
00:18:21,890 --> 00:18:24,020
Wait a second, let me imagine the earth...

320
00:18:27,620 --> 00:18:30,850
Eurasia continent

321
00:18:32,860 --> 00:18:37,150
Antarctica continent

322
00:18:37,150 --> 00:18:40,780
Africa continent

323
00:18:44,290 --> 00:18:47,820
Oceania continent

324
00:18:52,740 --> 00:18:55,380
America continent and Brazil continent

325
00:18:55,380 --> 00:19:00,690
Why Brazil? Why is Brazil there?

326
00:19:00,690 --> 00:19:04,460
It's probably a really big place in his mind

327
00:19:04,460 --> 00:19:06,240
It's actually quite small though

328
00:19:06,240 --> 00:19:08,330
So there's 5 continents

329
00:19:08,330 --> 00:19:10,330
This is just horrible

330
00:19:10,330 --> 00:19:13,900
Amazingly horrible

331
00:19:14,330 --> 00:19:17,350
What about question 12 for science

332
00:19:17,350 --> 00:19:20,940
Answer the five senses of the human body

333
00:19:20,940 --> 00:19:27,530
Can you name all five senses of the human body?

334
00:19:27,530 --> 00:19:29,700
I told him there's 5 this time

335
00:19:29,700 --> 00:19:34,090
Mouthfeel

336
00:19:36,340 --> 00:19:40,830
Mouthfeel? Mouthfeel?

337
00:19:40,830 --> 00:19:42,860
He means taste right

338
00:19:42,860 --> 00:19:44,730
The Sixth Sense

339
00:19:45,700 --> 00:19:49,910
Come on, we told him it's the five senses

340
00:19:49,910 --> 00:19:51,970
Mouthfeel...mouthfeel...

341
00:19:51,970 --> 00:19:53,320
Leave mouthfeel alone

342
00:19:53,320 --> 00:19:57,320
Pain-sense, the organ that senses pain, pain-sense

343
00:19:59,770 --> 00:20:02,150
Never heard of that before

344
00:20:02,150 --> 00:20:06,010
Pain-sense, the Sixth Sense

345
00:20:09,000 --> 00:20:13,820
View-sense

346
00:20:15,300 --> 00:20:19,060
Hear-sense... Sound, Sound

347
00:20:19,060 --> 00:20:22,410
He got this, he should be able to finish it all then

348
00:20:22,410 --> 00:20:24,170
That's all

349
00:20:27,100 --> 00:20:29,310
How could that be all

350
00:20:29,310 --> 00:20:32,870
Wow, that was amazing

351
00:20:32,870 --> 00:20:34,990
I didn't know it was this horrible

352
00:20:34,990 --> 00:20:37,560
Will he know about The Journey to The West?

353
00:20:37,560 --> 00:20:40,000
You mean all of the members?

354
00:20:40,000 --> 00:20:42,390
He should be able to name it...

355
00:20:42,390 --> 00:20:45,730
Well, regardless of whether it'll be aired, let's give it a go?

356
00:20:45,730 --> 00:20:51,670
Can you name all of the members in The Journey to The West?

357
00:20:53,490 --> 00:20:54,760
Monkey

358
00:20:54,760 --> 00:20:56,280
Eh?

359
00:20:56,280 --> 00:20:57,380
Why phrasing it this way

360
00:20:57,380 --> 00:20:57,960
Is he joking

361
00:20:57,960 --> 00:20:59,610
Pig

362
00:20:59,610 --> 00:21:00,440
Kappa (folklore)

363
00:21:02,610 --> 00:21:07,950
Monkey, pig, kappa

364
00:21:07,950 --> 00:21:09,940
Well, although it is...

365
00:21:09,940 --> 00:21:12,970
They all have a name right

366
00:21:12,970 --> 00:21:17,140
And lastly...a nun

367
00:21:18,410 --> 00:21:21,530
Wow, he said a nun just now

368
00:21:21,530 --> 00:21:28,070
That's just because Natsume Masako-san was acting for a male role

369
00:21:28,070 --> 00:21:30,340
Maybe also ask him what is the story about

370
00:21:30,340 --> 00:21:33,740
Yeah ask him to tell us the story of The Journey to the West

371
00:21:33,740 --> 00:21:36,170
Please tell us the story of The Journey to the West

372
00:21:36,170 --> 00:21:38,170
Story?

373
00:21:41,830 --> 00:21:46,100
Well the monkey...

374
00:21:46,100 --> 00:21:47,800
umm...

375
00:21:47,800 --> 00:21:54,710
and kappa and pig was...

376
00:21:54,710 --> 00:21:57,910
was together with a bald lady

377
00:21:57,910 --> 00:21:59,610
That's enough

378
00:22:03,620 --> 00:22:06,630
While they'll be in trouble with many happenings

379
00:22:06,630 --> 00:22:10,780
If the monkey is going too far...umm...

380
00:22:10,780 --> 00:22:15,760
The bald lady will punish the monkey by squeezing the thing on his head

381
00:22:15,760 --> 00:22:18,640
Don't he know their names? This is pissing me off

382
00:22:18,640 --> 00:22:20,850
It's Tripiṭaka Master, and he's not a lady

383
00:22:20,850 --> 00:22:25,860
Revealing the prank to Endo!!

384
00:22:26,650 --> 00:22:31,460
-Good work, good work     -Thank you

385
00:22:39,380 --> 00:22:43,270
It's not 100 questions?

386
00:22:43,270 --> 00:22:44,850
No it's not

387
00:22:44,850 --> 00:22:47,640
When did you start feeling strange about it?

388
00:22:47,640 --> 00:22:50,400
Well, I didn't really found anything strange

389
00:22:50,440 --> 00:22:52,660
Ah, so you thought it'll be like this for this time?

390
00:22:52,660 --> 00:22:55,760
I asked the staffs about having a lot of difficult questions

391
00:22:55,760 --> 00:22:59,120
It's not that difficult at all though

392
00:22:59,380 --> 00:23:02,560
Your answers to The Journey to the West was horrible

393
00:23:02,560 --> 00:23:05,580
So you don't know their names right?

394
00:23:05,580 --> 00:23:07,500
Masaaki Sakai right?

395
00:23:07,500 --> 00:23:08,670
No, no no no

396
00:23:08,670 --> 00:23:10,750
That's the name of the actor

397
00:23:10,750 --> 00:23:13,200
You're just a television kid

398
00:23:13,200 --> 00:23:14,840
That's not what we're asking for

399
00:23:15,420 --> 00:23:17,380
No one would answer like that

400
00:23:17,380 --> 00:23:19,830
We would never answer it like monkey or pigs...

401
00:23:19,830 --> 00:23:24,720
But it's indeed a story about monkey, pig and kappa right?

402
00:23:24,720 --> 00:23:28,600
-Well yeah, but they have their names too     -Name?

403
00:23:28,600 --> 00:23:32,460
Is he in Dragon Ball, and wearing those Golden hoop

404
00:23:32,460 --> 00:23:36,350
Yeah, it's in Dragon Ball

405
00:23:36,350 --> 00:23:37,390
Exactly his name

406
00:23:37,390 --> 00:23:39,060
Ah! Goku

407
00:23:39,060 --> 00:23:41,810
-Son Goku     -Yes, yes, exactly

408
00:23:41,810 --> 00:23:42,990
Ah, really?

409
00:23:48,770 --> 00:23:52,580
I'm actually not really familiar with The Journey to the West

410
00:23:52,580 --> 00:23:55,510
We know that, we clearly know that
