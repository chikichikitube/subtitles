1
00:00:00,460 --> 00:00:02,440
First time ever on Gaki no Tsuaki ya Arahende:

2
00:00:02,440 --> 00:00:07,440
Gaburi Chicken Food Marathon - 100,000 yen prize - Tokyo 20 store challenge!

3
00:00:09,200 --> 00:00:14,770
I just wanna say; Every time, I actually try to reach the goal,

4
00:00:14,770 --> 00:00:15,790
Yes that's true

5
00:00:15,790 --> 00:00:19,240
But these two "Lady Boys"

6
00:00:19,240 --> 00:00:22,220
Nah, last time it was Yama-chan

7
00:00:22,220 --> 00:00:24,130
Yes, you couldn't eat anymore

8
00:00:26,100 --> 00:00:29,640
Since you 5 can't do it, Fujiwara is joining you

9
00:00:29,640 --> 00:00:33,480
This time you should make it to 20 stores

10
00:00:34,820 --> 00:00:37,540
This time, the Food Marathon is hosted at;

11
00:00:38,260 --> 00:00:44,600
Gaburi Chicken! With their specialty bone-in chicken, popular with young people and salarymen

12
00:00:48,000 --> 00:00:53,720
The rule; They must eat one Hinadori (chick) and Oyadori (hen) bone-in piece

13
00:00:55,000 --> 00:01:00,920
As well, 2 people must cooperate to finish 1 of the 6 fried chicken items

14
00:01:02,380 --> 00:01:08,660
The key to victory will be how the 100g of fried chicken are shared between the 2 people

15
00:01:09,820 --> 00:01:11,800
2 people?
- Yes, 2 people

16
00:01:12,660 --> 00:01:17,020
So for sure we'll get this and that, or that and this

17
00:01:20,480 --> 00:01:22,910
Can we modify the rules a bit?

18
00:01:22,910 --> 00:01:26,970
These Lady Boys are already done for

19
00:01:26,970 --> 00:01:30,180
It's not my fault I'm a Lady Boy!

20
00:01:30,880 --> 00:01:34,420
First, they decide the fried chicken dishes for each member

21
00:01:35,220 --> 00:01:39,910
So if Hosei-san gets Neck, he has to eat Neck whenever it's his turn

22
00:01:38,100 --> 00:01:42,400
I just wanna say, if I keep getting eating Gizzard I think I might die

23
00:01:42,840 --> 00:01:44,820
So this draw really matters then?

24
00:01:45,580 --> 00:01:47,690
Yes, it decides what you eat

25
00:01:54,160 --> 00:01:56,060
Toritoro?

26
00:01:57,040 --> 00:02:00,600
Hamada gets the part between the wing and the neck,

27
00:02:00,600 --> 00:02:03,600
The juicy Toritoro!

28
00:02:04,850 --> 00:02:08,300
Those guys just went "Ohh!"

29
00:02:08,300 --> 00:02:09,700
I do know this,

30
00:02:09,880 --> 00:02:12,490
The Toritoro is a pain in the ass

31
00:02:13,420 --> 00:02:16,570
Alright that's it, that's it we're done

32
00:02:16,600 --> 00:02:19,440
Next, Matsumoto

33
00:02:20,140 --> 00:02:21,440
Matsumoto draws...

34
00:02:22,000 --> 00:02:24,940
The neck!

35
00:02:24,940 --> 00:02:26,390
How is the neck?

36
00:02:27,160 --> 00:02:32,720
The neck meat is taken from the neck! The texture is it's special point

37
00:02:32,860 --> 00:02:34,720
And I've heard about the neck as well,

38
00:02:35,200 --> 00:02:39,790
It's a pain in the ass compared to the Toritoro

39
00:02:39,790 --> 00:02:42,180
Really? Neck is like that?

40
00:02:43,060 --> 00:02:45,980
Next is Hosei

41
00:02:45,980 --> 00:02:49,460
If it's not Breast I can't do it

42
00:02:49,460 --> 00:02:53,280
I think not, eating breast all the time, it's gonna mess you up

43
00:02:53,280 --> 00:02:55,720
But still Breast is the easiest to eat. Here I go

44
00:02:58,740 --> 00:03:02,660
Yes! I won!

45
00:03:04,020 --> 00:03:08,260
Hosei gets the healthy breasts he was asking for

46
00:03:09,780 --> 00:03:13,110
And Endo gets the Gizzard, distinctive for it's mouth feel

47
00:03:13,400 --> 00:03:16,260
This is dangerous!

48
00:03:17,260 --> 00:03:19,020
Tanaka draws chicken wing flats.

49
00:03:19,260 --> 00:03:21,960
Chicken wing flats.

50
00:03:23,040 --> 00:03:26,120
Fujiwara gets boneless thigh

51
00:03:27,300 --> 00:03:32,680
And with their selections set, they choose who eats fried chicken at the first store

52
00:03:32,680 --> 00:03:35,180
The first person,

53
00:03:35,180 --> 00:03:36,400
Alright, flip,

54
00:03:36,400 --> 00:03:38,400
Matsumoto-san!

55
00:03:38,400 --> 00:03:40,000
He was the one who flipped it

56
00:03:41,400 --> 00:03:43,700
The first person is Matsumoto-san,

57
00:03:45,000 --> 00:03:47,400
Next, the 2nd person

58
00:03:53,160 --> 00:03:58,720
Typset & Timed by GakiDave
Translated by senor_wristband

59
00:04:02,000 --> 00:04:06,360
The 6 head towards Shimbashi

60
00:04:06,360 --> 00:04:09,740
When was the last time you ate nothing?

61
00:04:09,740 --> 00:04:11,950
I had one bread today

62
00:04:11,950 --> 00:04:14,170
When?

63
00:04:12,680 --> 00:04:14,170
In the morning

64
00:04:14,240 --> 00:04:17,000
How the hell am I supposed to know when you woke up?!

65
00:04:17,000 --> 00:04:19,620
The Old Man who Snapped

66
00:04:19,620 --> 00:04:23,610
I'm right aren't I? I don't know what time that is

67
00:04:23,610 --> 00:04:25,940
But, it was around 9:00 I think

68
00:04:25,940 --> 00:04:29,640
You've eaten nothing but 1 bread at 9?

69
00:04:27,640 --> 00:04:29,640
Because of this project

70
00:04:30,870 --> 00:04:34,300
What kind of bread?

71
00:04:32,780 --> 00:04:34,300
It was a "Lettuce Dog"

72
00:04:34,400 --> 00:04:36,900
What kind of bullshit bread is that?!

73
00:04:36,900 --> 00:04:40,160
What is a "Lettuce Dog"?

74
00:04:40,160 --> 00:04:42,160
This way, please.

75
00:04:46,200 --> 00:04:49,720
They arrive at the first store in Shimbashi

76
00:04:59,800 --> 00:05:02,080
So it's about that size

77
00:05:02,080 --> 00:05:04,800
This is the first time for everyone here

78
00:05:06,530 --> 00:05:09,240
This is the hinadori, and this is oyadori

79
00:05:09,240 --> 00:05:12,240
Looks delicious

80
00:05:12,920 --> 00:05:19,160
First they enjoy Gaburi's special bone-in fried chicken

81
00:05:19,160 --> 00:05:23,900
The oyadori (hen)\ has a firmer bite, and the flavour spreads in your mouth as you chew

82
00:05:26,020 --> 00:05:29,660
And the Hinadori (chick) is very soft and juicy!

83
00:05:30,460 --> 00:05:35,590
This is a popular menu item that lets you enjoy both flavours!

84
00:05:35,590 --> 00:05:37,000
Woah, looks delicious

85
00:05:38,440 --> 00:05:40,440
Bon appetit!

86
00:05:41,220 --> 00:05:44,320
It's so tender

87
00:05:47,060 --> 00:05:48,660
Please, dig in

88
00:05:49,260 --> 00:05:51,320
It has a strong flavour

89
00:05:51,320 --> 00:05:53,730
The oyadori right?

90
00:05:53,730 --> 00:05:56,730
It's great

91
00:06:06,940 --> 00:06:10,830
The bone-in chicken is gone in a flash!

92
00:06:11,840 --> 00:06:15,500
Next is Matsumoto and Hamada's fried chicken

93
00:06:15,500 --> 00:06:19,740
Toritori and Neck right?

94
00:06:19,740 --> 00:06:22,740
That's quite a lot, that's why I told you,

95
00:06:23,820 --> 00:06:27,860
If we keep getting this we're gonna die!

96
00:06:27,860 --> 00:06:32,860
Eh, I'm finishing this by myself?

97
00:06:29,220 --> 00:06:32,860
Yes, it became your responsibility

98
00:06:32,860 --> 00:06:35,120
If you have to keep that up for 3 stores,

99
00:06:37,180 --> 00:06:40,800
Hold on, we can't redecide the dishes half-way through?

100
00:06:39,620 --> 00:06:41,780
Exactly, you keep the same dish until the end

101
00:06:44,400 --> 00:06:46,320
Cause it's your responsibility

102
00:06:46,530 --> 00:06:49,480
It is delicious, but,

103
00:06:49,480 --> 00:06:53,980
The greasiness is a bit, well ..., alright I guess

104
00:06:56,940 --> 00:06:59,740
It's only the first store

105
00:06:59,740 --> 00:07:01,840
They didn't suffer at all

106
00:07:01,840 --> 00:07:04,380
Hamada-san, that's the face you make at the 10th store

107
00:07:04,380 --> 00:07:07,600
He looks stressed

108
00:07:05,840 --> 00:07:07,600
That's the face of anguish

109
00:07:08,500 --> 00:07:11,740
100 grams of fried chicken...

110
00:07:16,560 --> 00:07:21,400
It may be too much for the 55 year old DownTown\

111
00:07:21,680 --> 00:07:25,040
You know Salarymen and the like, after a hard day's work,

112
00:07:25,040 --> 00:07:28,440
They eat this while watching TV. That's the kind of dish this is.

113
00:07:27,880 --> 00:07:31,270
This is not something a single comedian eats by himself!!

114
00:07:31,270 --> 00:07:33,240
This is gonna take some time

115
00:07:33,240 --> 00:07:34,940
There's 20 stores after all

116
00:07:34,940 --> 00:07:37,100
Let's move on already!

117
00:07:36,060 --> 00:07:37,100
You ass...

118
00:07:37,100 --> 00:07:39,600
You're all still hungry right?

119
00:07:37,820 --> 00:07:39,630
We're still hungry!

120
00:07:39,600 --> 00:07:43,240
This enemy is stronger than I thought

121
00:07:43,240 --> 00:07:45,180
Hamada-san is finished eating

122
00:07:48,500 --> 00:07:50,620
Store 1 cleared!

123
00:07:51,600 --> 00:07:55,320
With that, they choose the fried chicken eaters for next time

124
00:07:55,320 --> 00:07:57,320
So we choose the 4 SAFE people first?

125
00:08:02,920 --> 00:08:04,740
Safe people first

126
00:08:05,680 --> 00:08:07,100
Endo-san safe!

127
00:08:08,670 --> 00:08:10,620
Amazing, Matsumoto-san!

128
00:08:10,620 --> 00:08:12,620
Matsumoto safe!

129
00:08:11,200 --> 00:08:12,630
Please!

130
00:08:13,330 --> 00:08:15,350
Tanaka safe!

131
00:08:14,400 --> 00:08:16,240
"Hosei"! "Hosei"!

132
00:08:16,240 --> 00:08:18,940
Oh, Fujiwara safe!
Which means ...

133
00:08:20,940 --> 00:08:23,300
It's Hamada-san, and Hosei-san

134
00:08:23,300 --> 00:08:25,100
The 2 Lady Boys

135
00:08:28,240 --> 00:08:32,280
Wow, we might end on the 2nd store for the first time

136
00:08:33,220 --> 00:08:39,210
For the second store, Hamada and Hosei are responsible for the fried chicken

137
00:08:40,620 --> 00:08:43,220
There's 19 stores left,

138
00:08:43,620 --> 00:08:45,450
However...

139
00:08:45,820 --> 00:08:47,450
No, I think,

140
00:08:47,820 --> 00:08:48,720
This is dangerous

141
00:08:48,720 --> 00:08:52,690
This is a bit risky, we need to change the rules

142
00:08:52,690 --> 00:08:56,980
They're tender, but each piece is so huge

143
00:08:56,980 --> 00:09:00,660
There were a lot of pieces

144
00:09:00,700 --> 00:09:04,220
This is hardy blood

145
00:09:05,260 --> 00:09:08,200
A continuous stream of complaints!

146
00:09:10,440 --> 00:09:14,180
And one more worry

147
00:09:14,180 --> 00:09:17,460
It's totally possible to get chosen 3 times in a row

148
00:09:17,460 --> 00:09:20,340
That's true, that could happen

149
00:09:20,340 --> 00:09:22,940
I'm trying my best, but I have a limit

150
00:09:23,900 --> 00:09:26,330
I'm really sorry, but

151
00:09:26,330 --> 00:09:30,490
Yoshinobu-san got it 3 times in a row (in the simulation)

152
00:09:30,490 --> 00:09:33,200
But he made it to 11 stores

153
00:09:35,300 --> 00:09:39,640
That's just cause his hostess was watching. Of course he'll push himself.

154
00:09:39,640 --> 00:09:43,210
He took his hostess to a location scout?

155
00:09:43,210 --> 00:09:47,860
Of course! They're soulmates, him and his hostess

156
00:09:49,440 --> 00:09:53,260
Gabburi Chicken marathon - The 2nd store is in Akasaka

157
00:09:54,340 --> 00:09:56,900
This is the Oyadori

158
00:10:11,060 --> 00:10:14,520
I can totally finish this

159
00:10:15,360 --> 00:10:17,200
Go ahead

160
00:10:17,940 --> 00:10:20,940
So breast, and toritoro

161
00:10:21,120 --> 00:10:22,620
Thank you

162
00:10:22,620 --> 00:10:26,320
The breast is for Hosei-san

163
00:10:26,320 --> 00:10:28,190
That looks really good

164
00:10:28,190 --> 00:10:30,940
I kinda want some

165
00:10:34,940 --> 00:10:36,520
Mmm, it's very soft

166
00:10:36,520 --> 00:10:39,140
Nobody is even looking at Hamada-san

167
00:10:39,140 --> 00:10:41,140
That looks really good

168
00:10:45,400 --> 00:10:49,280
Hamada just went "unnnh" - that's not good.

169
00:10:53,220 --> 00:10:56,020
Can we ask, what's the condition of your stomach?

170
00:10:56,150 --> 00:10:58,490
I'm 80% full

171
00:10:58,490 --> 00:11:00,260
It's still only the second store

172
00:11:01,370 --> 00:11:03,570
Zaki-san is finished his breasts

173
00:11:03,570 --> 00:11:07,580
It was easy to eat. It was tasty.

174
00:11:07,580 --> 00:11:11,600
Who would eat 8 of these massive pieces?

175
00:11:11,600 --> 00:11:14,300
I wouldn't eat that normally

176
00:11:12,840 --> 00:11:14,310
Exactly right?

177
00:11:14,300 --> 00:11:18,480
So I'm gonna take my time. I've never eaten 8 pieces before

178
00:11:23,060 --> 00:11:24,560
Then Hamada as well

179
00:11:27,480 --> 00:11:29,100
2nd store cleared

180
00:11:30,100 --> 00:11:33,100
Fried chicken selection for the 3rd store

181
00:11:33,200 --> 00:11:34,990
The first card, the first person is;

182
00:11:36,420 --> 00:11:38,390
Hosei gets the breast!

183
00:11:37,560 --> 00:11:38,890
Well, at least-

184
00:11:38,390 --> 00:11:41,140
No not "at least"! This is bullshit!

185
00:11:41,140 --> 00:11:44,370
What happened all of a sudden?

186
00:11:44,500 --> 00:11:51,640
This the second time in a row!

187
00:11:48,620 --> 00:11:51,640
TN: I think Hosei's chances are actually (1/6)*(1/5) = 1/30

188
00:11:48,620 --> 00:11:51,640
Well that's bound to happen, you have a 1/3 chance!

189
00:11:52,560 --> 00:11:54,360
And the other person,

190
00:11:55,340 --> 00:11:57,180
Tanaka-san, and his wing flats

191
00:11:57,450 --> 00:11:59,480
The first wings of the day

192
00:12:02,620 --> 00:12:05,520
The battle has only just started

193
00:12:06,900 --> 00:12:08,920
Are there any vegetables?

194
00:12:08,920 --> 00:12:11,140
Ah, there's a lot on the side menu

195
00:12:12,340 --> 00:12:14,180
Like onion slices

196
00:12:14,180 --> 00:12:16,900
But I have to pay for this myself right?

197
00:12:16,900 --> 00:12:19,180
You can get the person who gives up to pay for it

198
00:12:19,180 --> 00:12:21,460
I see, that makes sense

199
00:12:21,460 --> 00:12:25,040
I see. I can order anything then

200
00:12:25,440 --> 00:12:28,920
Since I'm definitely not gonna give up

201
00:12:28,920 --> 00:12:31,410
It's fine isn't it?

202
00:12:33,020 --> 00:12:36,710
In a quiet voice he said "It's  fine isn't it?"

203
00:12:38,000 --> 00:12:41,420
I don't care if he orders anything

204
00:12:39,560 --> 00:12:43,500
Yes, just order whatever you want

205
00:12:45,720 --> 00:12:48,600
I'll get Hamada to pay for this

206
00:12:49,780 --> 00:12:56,190
The toppings and vegetables are another specialty of Gaburi

207
00:12:57,500 --> 00:13:00,180
The 3rd store is in Shinjiku 2-chome

208
00:13:01,180 --> 00:13:04,360
Merry Gaburi-masu!

209
00:13:01,180 --> 00:13:10,320
(Note: Matsumoto is reading the store's advertisement which reads \n"Merry Gaburi-masu" - a play on "Merry Christmas.")

210
00:13:04,360 --> 00:13:08,100
Merry Gaburi-masu!

211
00:13:08,320 --> 00:13:10,320
It said "Merry Gaburi-masu"

212
00:13:11,240 --> 00:13:12,940
The oyadori?

213
00:13:13,940 --> 00:13:17,440
Merry Gaburi-mas!

214
00:13:15,240 --> 00:13:17,440
And the Hinadori

215
00:13:18,360 --> 00:13:22,700
That worker really hated that
"Merry Gaburi-masu"

216
00:13:22,700 --> 00:13:24,200
This much Oya?

217
00:13:27,580 --> 00:13:30,420
There's quite a lot of this

218
00:13:38,180 --> 00:13:41,280
It's perfect for take-out

219
00:13:41,280 --> 00:13:43,840
Ah there it is, thank you!

220
00:13:43,840 --> 00:13:45,840
The wing flats?

221
00:13:49,600 --> 00:13:50,760
They're huge!

222
00:13:51,460 --> 00:13:54,040
And Hosei-san's consecutive breasts

223
00:13:58,500 --> 00:14:02,100
It's mostly bone!

224
00:14:04,240 --> 00:14:07,170
I think that's rude to the store

225
00:14:07,170 --> 00:14:10,510
Maybe he's pregnant

226
00:14:12,720 --> 00:14:15,940
These wing flats are 100g including the bone

227
00:14:17,420 --> 00:14:19,150
And then,

228
00:14:19,150 --> 00:14:24,500
I think this guy might cheat a bit, we should pay attention

229
00:14:24,500 --> 00:14:25,880
No there's no way

230
00:14:25,880 --> 00:14:27,880
Look look at that

231
00:14:27,160 --> 00:14:27,880
This?

232
00:14:27,880 --> 00:14:29,310
There's a bit there

233
00:14:29,310 --> 00:14:30,800
Of course, of course

234
00:14:30,800 --> 00:14:32,800
And there too

235
00:14:34,000 --> 00:14:36,950
The checks are strict

236
00:14:36,950 --> 00:14:40,840
TN: Also known as "Ulnar collateral ligament reconstruction"

237
00:14:36,950 --> 00:14:40,840
This Tommy John Surgery location

238
00:14:41,940 --> 00:14:43,610
That's finished there isn't it?

239
00:14:43,610 --> 00:14:46,100
No way, that part needs to be surgically removed

240
00:14:48,500 --> 00:14:50,120
That too?

241
00:14:50,460 --> 00:14:55,980
Meanwhile, Hosei finishes his consecutive breasts

242
00:14:56,160 --> 00:14:58,180
Are you lying?

243
00:14:58,180 --> 00:15:00,180
I'm done too

244
00:15:00,820 --> 00:15:03,240
Hold on, everyone is checking it first. How is it?

245
00:15:03,240 --> 00:15:05,700
C'mon cut it out, stop checking my wings

246
00:15:05,700 --> 00:15:07,840
But that part,

247
00:15:06,320 --> 00:15:07,840
C'mon!

248
00:15:07,840 --> 00:15:10,900
Isn't that meat there?

249
00:15:09,420 --> 00:15:10,900
That's not meat

250
00:15:10,900 --> 00:15:12,080
Really?

251
00:15:12,080 --> 00:15:13,900
It's the bone

252
00:15:13,900 --> 00:15:17,280
Hold on, stop bringing the camera closer

253
00:15:17,280 --> 00:15:19,040
Cut it out

254
00:15:20,060 --> 00:15:24,100
This is how much everyone has eaten after the 3rd store

255
00:15:24,100 --> 00:15:28,400
Hamada and Hosei have already eaten 440g!

256
00:15:30,640 --> 00:15:33,060
And the next fried chicken eaters?

257
00:15:33,940 --> 00:15:35,440
The first person,

258
00:15:36,200 --> 00:15:39,380
Ah, Fujiwara

259
00:15:39,380 --> 00:15:40,880
Here I go

260
00:15:43,260 --> 00:15:44,900
Again!

261
00:15:45,400 --> 00:15:48,220
You got it consecutively!

262
00:15:49,500 --> 00:15:53,480
We did say that before, it's bound to be consecutive!

263
00:15:54,400 --> 00:15:56,860
The 4th store, in Kabukicho

264
00:16:05,060 --> 00:16:08,020
What was that? Are you alright? You tripped, are you alright?

265
00:16:08,020 --> 00:16:11,360
There's no step here right? But he tripped on that

266
00:16:11,360 --> 00:16:16,000
It's just the colour that's different, he thought it was a step!

267
00:16:14,890 --> 00:16:16,620
Are you alright?

268
00:16:19,160 --> 00:16:21,090
That's no good

269
00:16:25,220 --> 00:16:27,420
Hinadori

270
00:16:42,120 --> 00:16:45,800
She said it was "Hina", but this is "Oya"

271
00:16:45,800 --> 00:16:47,570
There's no need for that face

272
00:16:47,570 --> 00:16:51,710
This is so much

273
00:16:50,320 --> 00:16:51,710
Mmmhmm!!

274
00:16:50,320 --> 00:16:53,690
TN: Tanaka is not using honorifics for his senior Hamada

275
00:16:51,710 --> 00:16:53,690
What the hell do you mean "Mmmhmm"?

276
00:16:55,900 --> 00:16:58,040
That was out of line

277
00:16:58,040 --> 00:17:03,140
No that's not right, that "Mmmhmm" was not right!

278
00:17:04,500 --> 00:17:09,400
The fried chicken is Tanaka's 2 wings and Fujiwara's boneless thigh

279
00:17:10,290 --> 00:17:11,400
Itadakimasu.

280
00:17:18,060 --> 00:17:21,160
Is it better than the Oyadori?

281
00:17:20,120 --> 00:17:24,160
It's as tender as the Hinadori

282
00:17:26,120 --> 00:17:31,460
Fujiwara enjoys the 7 time winner of the Fried Chicken Grand Prix

283
00:17:32,920 --> 00:17:35,580
And Tanaka's wings?

284
00:17:42,260 --> 00:17:44,590
Can we check your wings?

285
00:17:44,590 --> 00:17:45,920
How is the wing check?

286
00:17:45,920 --> 00:17:52,100
Stop, move out of the way. That's meat isn't?

287
00:17:52,100 --> 00:17:55,570
It's hard to judge the wings

288
00:17:53,420 --> 00:17:55,570
Yes, it's hard

289
00:17:56,140 --> 00:17:58,350
You need eat enough so that we don't say anything

290
00:17:59,000 --> 00:18:03,900
They might be bones, but you need to eat them like they're meat

291
00:18:08,140 --> 00:18:10,180
He gets over the strict check

292
00:18:10,740 --> 00:18:15,280
Look at that, that's meat

293
00:18:16,080 --> 00:18:18,520
Tanaka manages to finish

294
00:18:18,880 --> 00:18:20,240
Ok ok ok, I'm sorry!

295
00:18:21,240 --> 00:18:24,630
The 5th fried chicken eater;

296
00:18:24,630 --> 00:18:27,720
So the first person to eat fried chicken,

297
00:18:29,940 --> 00:18:31,940
This is dangerous

298
00:18:31,940 --> 00:18:34,940
Your third time

299
00:18:35,510 --> 00:18:36,840
Seriously?

300
00:18:37,300 --> 00:18:40,220
He sounded like a trapped chicken

301
00:18:40,860 --> 00:18:42,700
And the next person,

302
00:18:47,260 --> 00:18:49,820
The Lady Boys once again

303
00:18:49,820 --> 00:18:51,060
This is amazing!

304
00:18:51,060 --> 00:18:53,060
This is the 3rd time for both of you right?

305
00:19:00,280 --> 00:19:04,360
Gaburi Chicken Marathon - This is the current total

306
00:19:04,360 --> 00:19:10,300
Hamada and Hosei have passed 520g. What will happen?

307
00:19:10,640 --> 00:19:14,640
I think the card draws are a fantastic idea

308
00:19:14,640 --> 00:19:16,740
You've changed your opinion from the start

309
00:19:16,740 --> 00:19:23,140
That's true, I got it first. But I haven't eaten in a while

310
00:19:23,140 --> 00:19:26,740
I'm starting to miss the neck

311
00:19:28,830 --> 00:19:34,500
I want some neck. I want neck more than I want a necklace.

312
00:19:34,500 --> 00:19:36,500
That wasn't funny at all

313
00:19:38,740 --> 00:19:42,440
Well of course, if we start laughing at stuff like that...

314
00:19:40,800 --> 00:19:42,440
Yes, I understand too

315
00:19:42,440 --> 00:19:45,850
Once I start making neck puns,

316
00:19:45,850 --> 00:19:47,650
I will quit comedy

317
00:19:46,800 --> 00:19:49,620
What should we get for the topping? Something Japanese?

318
00:19:49,620 --> 00:19:52,190
Of course. Ponzu

319
00:19:52,190 --> 00:19:55,570
You should've gotten it with your breasts!

320
00:19:54,340 --> 00:19:55,570
I want to try it

321
00:19:55,570 --> 00:19:59,500
It will be a real pain in the NECK if we can't get a topping for neck

322
00:20:00,820 --> 00:20:05,010
He said it

323
00:20:01,560 --> 00:20:03,820
God that was painful

324
00:20:06,240 --> 00:20:08,940
No, that's not good

325
00:20:10,140 --> 00:20:14,720
The 5th store, Takadanobaba

326
00:20:15,900 --> 00:20:19,120
Here too they start with the bone-in chicken

327
00:20:30,080 --> 00:20:34,940
It wasn't this firm before

328
00:20:34,940 --> 00:20:39,170
I'm getting used to the Oya

329
00:20:39,170 --> 00:20:41,410
Yes, you start to feel it by the 5th store

330
00:20:41,410 --> 00:20:44,470
But you've gotten pretty used to it

331
00:20:44,470 --> 00:20:47,820
This is the 7th store I think

332
00:20:47,820 --> 00:20:49,160
It's the fifth one!

333
00:20:49,160 --> 00:20:53,220
Man this is some weird editing you did here

334
00:20:51,720 --> 00:20:53,220
Editing?

335
00:20:55,760 --> 00:20:58,120
The problem starts with this

336
00:20:58,580 --> 00:21:01,880
Hamada and Hosei's 3rd serving!

337
00:21:05,220 --> 00:21:07,020
Oh man my back hurts

338
00:21:10,860 --> 00:21:12,560
Do you want some topping?

339
00:21:16,700 --> 00:21:23,160
Doing that will slow us down, let's just get through them

340
00:21:26,360 --> 00:21:29,400
I just can't eat anymore

341
00:21:31,400 --> 00:21:33,510
Certainly, I understand

342
00:21:33,510 --> 00:21:36,310
He means just for now

343
00:21:39,380 --> 00:21:41,980
These 2 aren't moving their chopsticks

344
00:21:42,460 --> 00:21:45,770
He's such an old man

345
00:21:45,770 --> 00:21:48,980
We're just waiting on the breasts now. The Lady Boys™

346
00:21:55,720 --> 00:21:57,880
And with that,

347
00:21:57,880 --> 00:22:01,550
Hamada-san is on his 10th piece of chicken

348
00:22:01,550 --> 00:22:04,150
It's the 11th isn't it

349
00:22:03,010 --> 00:22:05,060
He's on his 11th, wow

350
00:22:05,060 --> 00:22:10,270
This ADULT. This 50+ man is on his 11th piece

351
00:22:11,200 --> 00:22:18,400
Including the initial bone-in chicken, Hamada-san and Hosei-san are at 700g

352
00:22:22,000 --> 00:22:28,340
They struggle, but manage to get the chicken in their mouths

353
00:22:31,900 --> 00:22:33,900
Such small bites!

354
00:22:34,460 --> 00:22:36,440
Just eat the whole thing already

355
00:22:36,440 --> 00:22:40,140
I think we're in danger

356
00:22:40,140 --> 00:22:44,240
Will the next card draw be alright?

357
00:22:49,680 --> 00:22:51,680
And then Hamada as well

358
00:22:52,630 --> 00:22:55,000
He passed on!

359
00:22:57,700 --> 00:22:59,440
"Passed on"?

360
00:22:59,440 --> 00:23:02,100
It's cause we thought you died

361
00:23:07,620 --> 00:23:12,560
The fierce battle at Gaburi chicken continues ... What will the result be?

362
00:23:15,860 --> 00:23:17,700
Next time;

363
00:23:17,700 --> 00:23:21,460
Gaburi Chicken Maratathon - Finale!

364
00:23:22,420 --> 00:23:25,440
An uncertainty lingers

365
00:23:30,780 --> 00:23:33,580
What awaits the 6?

366
00:23:40,780 --> 00:23:43,780
And then, a sudden change for a man

367
00:23:44,580 --> 00:23:47,290
Oh shit oh shit

368
00:23:46,310 --> 00:23:48,930
Please, not that

369
00:23:48,960 --> 00:23:51,200
I can't eat anymore...

370
00:23:53,070 --> 00:23:54,750
Is that a Give Up?
