00:00:13,800 --> 00:00:21,810
[Subbed by Thanos-no-Tsukai
Thanks For Watching!]

2
00:00:22,970 --> 00:00:24,910
When I got invited...

3
00:00:27,710 --> 00:00:28,410
I honestly...

4
00:00:31,280 --> 00:00:35,250
...didn't think this was something I could do.

5
00:00:35,820 --> 00:00:40,020
"Kaeru Pyokopyoko Mipyokopyoko Awasete Pyokopyoko Mupyokopyoko"

6
00:00:40,290 --> 00:00:44,530
I actually love to come up with new material.

7
00:00:44,800 --> 00:00:48,430
But I don't really see myself as a comedian.

8
00:00:49,700 --> 00:00:51,970
As for my art style...

9
00:00:52,400 --> 00:00:53,000
Well...

10
00:00:53,770 --> 00:00:57,470
I've been living my life in a sort of 'improvisational' manner.

11
00:00:57,510 --> 00:01:01,150
Not a single one of my members goes along with any of my jokes.

12
00:01:01,680 --> 00:01:05,380
No matter how hard I play the funny man, they will refuse to play along as the straight man.

13
00:01:06,050 --> 00:01:10,920
So I think I've been living in quite the harsh comedic environment.

14
00:01:11,090 --> 00:01:18,130
All the Sumo of my generation were taught to remain stoic even in victory.

15
00:01:18,530 --> 00:01:19,530
R-Right...

16
00:01:21,030 --> 00:01:27,240
We were taught to show respect for our opponents and were never allowed to laugh.

17
00:01:27,840 --> 00:01:30,110
Now, I've gotten older.

18
00:01:32,180 --> 00:01:38,580
And now I'm a regular in all these variety shows where I laugh all the time.

19
00:01:38,680 --> 00:01:44,120
So yes, I don't think I have any advantage over the other members.

20
00:02:52,060 --> 00:02:52,690
So dangerous!

21
00:02:53,960 --> 00:02:54,690
That could have gone very bad.

22
00:02:54,690 --> 00:02:54,860
Taking that angle?
That could have gone very bad.

23
00:02:54,860 --> 00:02:55,330
Taking that angle?

24
00:03:00,400 --> 00:03:01,600
An orange card!

25
00:03:03,800 --> 00:03:06,340
"You see..."

26
00:03:09,270 --> 00:03:10,540
"I..."

27
00:03:16,450 --> 00:03:16,910
Yellow!

28
00:03:18,280 --> 00:03:20,550
You were smirking the whole time.

29
00:03:23,020 --> 00:03:23,990
Oh no...

30
00:03:25,220 --> 00:03:26,190
You just laughed.

31
00:03:29,030 --> 00:03:31,160
Katsunori Takahashi... Red card!

32
00:03:31,830 --> 00:03:33,260
-The first one?!
-There it is!!

33
00:03:41,870 --> 00:03:44,440
-Goto did some excellent work for us out there.
-No, no, not at all.

34
00:03:44,440 --> 00:03:45,080
You sure stirred things up.
-Goto did some excellent work for us out there.
-No, no, not at all.

35
00:03:45,080 --> 00:03:45,440
You sure stirred things up.

36
00:03:45,440 --> 00:03:46,680
Alright, here we go.

37
00:03:48,810 --> 00:03:49,880
That's so painful!

38
00:03:50,050 --> 00:03:51,280
Everyone's gotta get ready.

39
00:03:51,280 --> 00:03:52,920
I need to cool my ass down!

40
00:03:52,920 --> 00:03:53,420
You should.
I need to cool my ass down!

41
00:03:53,420 --> 00:03:53,850
You should.

42
00:03:53,880 --> 00:03:55,990
That really hurt!

43
00:03:56,920 --> 00:03:58,290
You've got quite the swing.

44
00:03:58,290 --> 00:03:58,890
You think so?

45
00:03:58,920 --> 00:03:59,390
Yeah.

46
00:04:01,960 --> 00:04:02,530
Yo! Yo!

47
00:04:03,930 --> 00:04:04,330
Yo!

48
00:04:05,060 --> 00:04:06,000
How ya'll doing?

49
00:04:07,030 --> 00:04:07,430
Yo!

50
00:04:07,970 --> 00:04:09,500
Ken Griffey Jr. is here.

51
00:04:09,600 --> 00:04:10,230
You're right.

52
00:04:11,340 --> 00:04:13,770
Oyakata, are you Ken Griffey Jr.?

53
00:04:14,240 --> 00:04:15,070
The left-handed batter, right?

54
00:04:15,070 --> 00:04:15,910
-That's right.
-I am Takanohana!
The left-handed batter, right?

55
00:04:15,910 --> 00:04:17,310
-That's right.
-I am Takanohana!

56
00:04:17,570 --> 00:04:19,080
Yo! How you doing?

57
00:04:19,580 --> 00:04:20,740
That's pretty funny.

58
00:04:20,940 --> 00:04:21,810
Are you a rapper?

59
00:04:21,810 --> 00:04:22,280
Yes.

60
00:04:23,250 --> 00:04:24,720
Yo! Yo! Yo!

61
00:04:24,920 --> 00:04:25,150
Yo!

62
00:04:26,350 --> 00:04:26,720
Yo!

63
00:04:27,550 --> 00:04:29,050
He's got a big body so it works.

64
00:04:29,050 --> 00:04:30,020
-Huh?
-It's over?!

65
00:04:30,520 --> 00:04:31,320
That's it?

66
00:04:33,060 --> 00:04:33,890
Amazing.

67
00:04:34,990 --> 00:04:35,590
That was fast.

68
00:04:35,930 --> 00:04:39,200
He made such a big deal and just left...

69
00:04:40,560 --> 00:04:43,530
So even Yokozuna give up that easily, huh?

70
00:04:44,200 --> 00:04:46,670
Right, they are touted for their unremitting tenacity.

71
00:04:51,640 --> 00:04:53,880
I actually wanted to ask everyone for some advice.

72
00:04:53,980 --> 00:04:54,280
Sure.

73
00:04:54,610 --> 00:05:02,520
With the pandemic, streamed shows have been getting more and more popular.

74
00:05:02,950 --> 00:05:12,760
So we got a great opportunity here at Amazon Prime to produce our very own show.

75
00:05:12,900 --> 00:05:17,570
And our project was green-lit after some discussions with the higher ups.

76
00:05:17,570 --> 00:05:18,540
-Really?
-Amazing.

77
00:05:20,400 --> 00:05:26,680
So Kishidan will be producing a new drama series at Amazon Prime. (EN" 1)

78
00:05:26,680 --> 00:05:27,240
Amazing!
So Kishidan will be producing a new drama series at Amazon Prime. (EN" 1)

79
00:05:27,240 --> 00:05:28,950
So Kishidan will be producing a new drama series at Amazon Prime. (EN" 1)

80
00:05:28,950 --> 00:05:29,010
That's great!
So Kishidan will be producing a new drama series at Amazon Prime. (EN" 1)

81
00:05:29,010 --> 00:05:29,580
That's great!

82
00:05:31,520 --> 00:05:37,820
But we actually haven't cast the protagonist or the antagonist yet.

83
00:05:39,990 --> 00:05:45,130
So if anyone here is interested I'd love to hold an audition right now.

84
00:05:45,560 --> 00:05:45,860
Sure.

85
00:05:45,860 --> 00:05:46,660
I'm honored.

86
00:05:46,930 --> 00:05:48,330
-Thank you.
-Let's try it out.

87
00:05:48,430 --> 00:05:48,770
Alright.

88
00:05:49,130 --> 00:05:51,570
You can take a look at the script.

89
00:05:54,100 --> 00:05:55,170
Here you go.

90
00:05:56,470 --> 00:05:57,240
Please take a look.

91
00:05:58,440 --> 00:05:59,080
Here you go.

92
00:05:59,640 --> 00:06:01,140
"True Account: One..."

93
00:06:01,140 --> 00:06:01,410
That's right.

94
00:06:01,880 --> 00:06:04,010
The title is "True Account: One Night Carnival".

95
00:06:04,210 --> 00:06:09,750
And it is actually my original idea.

96
00:06:09,990 --> 00:06:16,490
So if you open the first page, you'll see that my role is still undetermined.

97
00:06:16,690 --> 00:06:19,660
But most of the other roles have already been cast.

98
00:06:20,200 --> 00:06:24,200
My girlfriend's part will be played by Suzu Hirose.

99
00:06:25,040 --> 00:06:28,040
The homeroom teacher part will be played by Mr. Makidai.

100
00:06:28,940 --> 00:06:32,280
The delinquent former student part will be played by Mansion Kubota.

101
00:06:32,280 --> 00:06:32,880
Mansion? (EN: 2)
The delinquent former student part will be played by Mansion Kubota.

102
00:06:32,880 --> 00:06:32,980
Mansion? (EN: 2)

103
00:06:32,980 --> 00:06:33,080
Mansion Kubota?
Mansion? (EN: 2)

104
00:06:33,080 --> 00:06:33,580
Mansion Kubota?

105
00:06:33,680 --> 00:06:39,120
Yes, the former member of Iitomo Seinentai. (EN: 3)

106
00:06:39,580 --> 00:06:42,650
And for the part of me as a child...

107
00:06:43,390 --> 00:06:45,360
It will be played by Kinya Kitaouji. (80yo actor)

108
00:06:45,590 --> 00:06:47,990
-Mr. Kitaouji will play you as a child?
-That's right.

109
00:06:47,990 --> 00:06:50,590
Yes, he's already agreed to play the part.

110
00:06:51,060 --> 00:06:52,060
He's playing a child?

111
00:06:52,060 --> 00:06:54,930
Yes, Kinya Kitaouji will be playing my childhood self.

112
00:06:54,930 --> 00:06:55,300
Those are some peculiar casting choices.
Yes, Kinya Kitaouji will be playing my childhood self.

113
00:06:55,300 --> 00:06:56,070
Those are some peculiar casting choices.

114
00:06:56,930 --> 00:07:00,600
And the bloodthirsty killer will be played by Mr. Tamori. (EN: 4))

115
00:07:01,040 --> 00:07:03,070
What's with all the explanations?

116
00:07:03,470 --> 00:07:05,340
And Asami Kumakiri will be playing the role of Ayumi Hamasaki.

117
00:07:05,340 --> 00:07:06,540
Ayumi Hamasaki?
And Asami Kumakiri will be playing the role of Ayumi Hamasaki.

118
00:07:06,540 --> 00:07:09,180
And Asami Kumakiri will be playing the role of Ayumi Hamasaki.

119
00:07:09,180 --> 00:07:09,280
Huh?
And Asami Kumakiri will be playing the role of Ayumi Hamasaki.

120
00:07:09,280 --> 00:07:09,610
Huh?

121
00:07:09,980 --> 00:07:14,220
That's right.
Anyway, most of the roles have already been filled.

122
00:07:14,220 --> 00:07:14,620
Isn't this amazing?

123
00:07:14,620 --> 00:07:15,320
Now I'd like to hold some auditions with all of you.
Isn't this amazing?

124
00:07:15,320 --> 00:07:18,490
Now I'd like to hold some auditions with all of you.

125
00:07:18,620 --> 00:07:24,430
But first, who would like to play the leading role of Sho Ayanokoji?

126
00:07:25,730 --> 00:07:27,900
Could we have everyone audition once?

127
00:07:27,900 --> 00:07:28,600
-Sure.
-That would be great.
Could we have everyone audition once?

128
00:07:28,600 --> 00:07:29,500
-Sure.
-That would be great.

129
00:07:29,770 --> 00:07:32,770
Alright, we just need to get the first person into the outfit.

130
00:07:32,840 --> 00:07:35,010
So, who would like to go first?

131
00:07:35,340 --> 00:07:35,940
I'll do it.

132
00:07:35,940 --> 00:07:36,240
Alright, thank you.
I'll do it.

133
00:07:36,240 --> 00:07:36,910
Alright, thank you.

134
00:07:37,470 --> 00:07:39,210
Please come over here.

135
00:07:40,010 --> 00:07:40,440
Over here.

136
00:07:40,540 --> 00:07:41,610
But there are no lines...

137
00:07:42,480 --> 00:07:43,380
No lines?

138
00:07:43,880 --> 00:07:44,580
Didn't he write anything?

139
00:07:45,080 --> 00:07:45,780
Is it ad-lib?

140
00:07:45,880 --> 00:07:47,420
They must be doing ad-lib.

141
00:07:47,980 --> 00:07:49,850
They must be.

142
00:07:52,020 --> 00:07:55,730
Once I stepped into the room I could immediately feel that the mood was different from the usual Documentals.

143
00:07:55,790 --> 00:07:56,660
-Oh, really?
-Yes.

144
00:07:57,790 --> 00:08:01,130
Like they're not looking at the right places.

145
00:08:02,030 --> 00:08:03,270
-Like they're just wandering around?
-Totally!

146
00:08:04,570 --> 00:08:09,540
Even if they look at you, it doesn't seem like everyone is on the same page.

147
00:08:09,640 --> 00:08:10,640
Well, that's to be expected.

148
00:08:11,840 --> 00:08:12,340
Right...

149
00:08:19,020 --> 00:08:21,180
Are you teaching wrestling to small kids now?

150
00:08:21,420 --> 00:08:22,850
I am.

151
00:08:23,420 --> 00:08:23,720
Like middle-schoolers?

152
00:08:23,720 --> 00:08:24,620
Well, it's not just children...
Like middle-schoolers?

153
00:08:24,620 --> 00:08:26,620
Well, it's not just children...

154
00:08:27,520 --> 00:08:28,330
But I'm also teaching adults now.

155
00:08:28,430 --> 00:08:29,290
Oh, is that so?

156
00:08:29,290 --> 00:08:29,590
They're having a normal conversation.
Oh, is that so?

157
00:08:29,590 --> 00:08:30,690
They're having a normal conversation.

158
00:08:31,760 --> 00:08:33,460
It's just your usual small talk.

159
00:08:34,230 --> 00:08:35,830
Even though they were going at it moments ago...

160
00:08:35,830 --> 00:08:36,930
Right? What's going on?

161
00:08:38,140 --> 00:08:41,070
It feels like they're just on stand-by waiting for the show to start.

162
00:08:42,370 --> 00:08:43,840
Look at them.

163
00:08:44,640 --> 00:08:46,510
But they might forget about the show and accidentally laugh.

164
00:08:47,480 --> 00:08:49,210
He's playing with the whoopee cushion again.

165
00:08:53,350 --> 00:08:54,580
That was so out of the blue too.

166
00:08:55,050 --> 00:08:56,990
This guy is unleashed.

167
00:08:58,120 --> 00:08:59,320
Sorry for the wait.

168
00:08:59,820 --> 00:09:03,860
I thought it best to have him wear the actual costume.

169
00:09:05,260 --> 00:09:06,300
-I'm ready!
-Alright!

170
00:09:06,460 --> 00:09:09,700
I will play some music, are you ready with your line?

171
00:09:10,630 --> 00:09:11,170
H-Huh?

172
00:09:11,270 --> 00:09:11,770
Line?

173
00:09:12,070 --> 00:09:15,070
Yes, there's a line in the script.

174
00:09:15,710 --> 00:09:17,070
Please read it.

175
00:09:17,440 --> 00:09:17,840
Huh?

176
00:09:21,610 --> 00:09:22,710
Comedy rivals!

177
00:09:22,710 --> 00:09:23,510
Just one line, huh?

178
00:09:24,780 --> 00:09:25,520
I see.

179
00:09:31,120 --> 00:09:33,590
-Hold on...
-What's up with the botched timing?

180
00:09:33,690 --> 00:09:34,320
Alright.

181
00:09:41,100 --> 00:09:42,800
-One more, please.
-Go ahead!

182
00:09:43,800 --> 00:09:44,700
We're going again.

183
00:09:44,800 --> 00:09:46,000
He was pretty late, wasn't he?

184
00:09:46,000 --> 00:09:49,540
Alright, please come out with the music.

185
00:09:55,310 --> 00:09:56,280
Go ahead!

186
00:10:01,520 --> 00:10:02,620
Wanna come hang at my place?

187
00:10:04,450 --> 00:10:06,520
-Cut! Thank you!
-What the heck is this?

188
00:10:07,960 --> 00:10:11,060
Well, I wanted you to pack more punch into that delivery.

189
00:10:11,390 --> 00:10:12,400
Like: "Wanna come hang out?".

190
00:10:13,460 --> 00:10:14,760
Alright, let's go to the next person.

191
00:10:15,430 --> 00:10:17,370
Musaka, could you get changed?

192
00:10:17,370 --> 00:10:18,000
Okay, okay.
Musaka, could you get changed?

193
00:10:18,000 --> 00:10:18,070
Okay, okay.

194
00:10:18,070 --> 00:10:18,770
-Changed?!
-Just do it in that outfit.
Okay, okay.

195
00:10:18,770 --> 00:10:20,870
-Changed?!
-Just do it in that outfit.

196
00:10:20,940 --> 00:10:21,770
Sure thing.

197
00:10:22,070 --> 00:10:23,970
Oyakata is falling asleep!

198
00:10:23,970 --> 00:10:24,810
Oh, you're right.

199
00:10:25,240 --> 00:10:25,810
Is he awake?

200
00:10:25,840 --> 00:10:27,310
-He's sleeping.
-Oyakata is sleeping.

201
00:10:27,310 --> 00:10:28,040
He is.

202
00:10:29,080 --> 00:10:31,520
It must not be funny at all.

203
00:10:33,950 --> 00:10:34,580
Look.

204
00:10:34,650 --> 00:10:37,120
He looks so uninterested.

205
00:10:37,120 --> 00:10:37,890
-He really does.
-Totally.
He looks so uninterested.

206
00:10:37,890 --> 00:10:40,020
-He really does.
-Totally.

207
00:10:40,920 --> 00:10:42,730
Alright, are you ready?

208
00:10:43,160 --> 00:10:43,560
Okay!

209
00:10:43,660 --> 00:10:46,030
Please go ahead.
I'm playing the music.

210
00:10:57,110 --> 00:10:59,680
I'll turn every single one of you into minced meat!

211
00:11:02,110 --> 00:11:02,610
Cut!

212
00:11:03,180 --> 00:11:04,680
What a powerful delivery.

213
00:11:05,250 --> 00:11:06,320
Thank you.

214
00:11:06,550 --> 00:11:07,780
We needed Katsunori for this.

215
00:11:07,880 --> 00:11:08,990
That was wonderful.

216
00:11:08,990 --> 00:11:09,690
Thank you.

217
00:11:11,020 --> 00:11:11,590
Alright...

218
00:11:12,760 --> 00:11:14,930
-Oyakata, would you like to give it a go?
-Yes.

219
00:11:15,190 --> 00:11:16,490
Is he even gonna fit in the costume?

220
00:11:16,860 --> 00:11:19,760
You can just put it over your clothes.

221
00:11:20,430 --> 00:11:21,570
He's doing it.

222
00:11:22,000 --> 00:11:24,870
-He goes along with everything.
-He does anything he's asked to do.

223
00:11:25,000 --> 00:11:25,800
He's always up for it.

224
00:11:25,800 --> 00:11:26,670
He never refuses.
He's always up for it.

225
00:11:26,670 --> 00:11:28,340
He never refuses.

226
00:11:28,770 --> 00:11:30,240
He just keeps going.

227
00:11:30,240 --> 00:11:32,110
That's the path of the Sumo for you.

228
00:11:32,110 --> 00:11:33,010
Is it?

229
00:11:33,040 --> 00:11:33,510
Yes.

230
00:11:33,740 --> 00:11:34,510
-Alright, please go ahead.
-Sure.

231
00:11:34,680 --> 00:11:36,910
-He even had a second look at the line.
-He sure did.

232
00:11:36,910 --> 00:11:38,520
-Did he memorize it?
-I think so.

233
00:11:38,650 --> 00:11:39,780
Your delivery was extraordinary.

234
00:11:40,380 --> 00:11:41,650
-It was pretty cool.
-Wonderful.

235
00:11:41,820 --> 00:11:42,550
I'm ready!

236
00:11:42,650 --> 00:11:45,490
Alright, please go ahead.
Playing the music now.

237
00:11:46,560 --> 00:11:47,820
Here we go.

238
00:11:53,060 --> 00:11:53,830
It's Trump!

239
00:11:56,670 --> 00:12:00,700
I'm Sho Ayanokoji, my interview count is 21. (EN: 5)

240
00:12:02,510 --> 00:12:03,640
Isn't it body count?

241
00:12:04,440 --> 00:12:05,110
Cut!

242
00:12:06,040 --> 00:12:06,510
Alright!

243
00:12:07,610 --> 00:12:09,610
What about this one?
What do you think?

244
00:12:10,350 --> 00:12:11,010
I don't know!

245
00:12:11,010 --> 00:12:11,510
I can't tell!
I don't know!

246
00:12:11,510 --> 00:12:11,780
I can't tell!

247
00:12:11,780 --> 00:12:14,150
Shingo was also in the danger zone.

248
00:12:15,350 --> 00:12:16,450
Did you laugh?

249
00:12:17,590 --> 00:12:19,820
He said 'interview', didn't he?

250
00:12:20,120 --> 00:12:21,790
Let's check this one out.

251
00:12:21,990 --> 00:12:22,590
-Yes!
-Let's!

252
00:12:22,660 --> 00:12:23,690
Two people are guilty.

253
00:12:23,760 --> 00:12:24,430
-Huh?!
-Two people?!

254
00:12:24,660 --> 00:12:27,860
It's Shingo and Sho.

255
00:12:28,830 --> 00:12:32,100
It's still a bit unclear...

256
00:12:32,370 --> 00:12:34,570
So let's check it out.

257
00:12:47,050 --> 00:12:51,290
I'm Sho Ayanokoji, my interview count is 21.

258
00:12:52,920 --> 00:12:53,820
Isn't it body count?

259
00:12:55,590 --> 00:12:56,290
Thanks!

260
00:13:04,770 --> 00:13:07,140
Alright, let's look at Mr. Ayanokoji.

261
00:13:09,840 --> 00:13:13,940
I'm Sho Ayanokoji, my interview count is 21.

262
00:13:15,650 --> 00:13:16,680
Isn't it body count?

263
00:13:17,580 --> 00:13:18,150
Cut!

264
00:13:18,310 --> 00:13:19,120
Thanks!

265
00:13:20,180 --> 00:13:22,250
I don't know about this one!

266
00:13:22,390 --> 00:13:26,620
-I was just being very enthusiastic with the 'cut'.

267
00:13:26,820 --> 00:13:28,690
It might have sounded like a laugh.

268
00:13:29,490 --> 00:13:32,130
I just had this sudden urge.

269
00:13:32,430 --> 00:13:33,260
-To go big!
-I see...

270
00:13:33,330 --> 00:13:33,730
Yeah.

271
00:13:33,860 --> 00:13:36,030
What do your penalties look like?

272
00:13:36,170 --> 00:13:37,100
I think it's yellow, yellow.

273
00:13:37,100 --> 00:13:37,400
Yellow, yellow?
I think it's yellow, yellow.

274
00:13:37,400 --> 00:13:38,300
Yellow, yellow?

275
00:13:39,700 --> 00:13:40,770
Orange, orange!

276
00:13:41,070 --> 00:13:42,310
Double?!

277
00:13:42,510 --> 00:13:43,540
So strict!

278
00:13:44,040 --> 00:13:46,740
-He's so harsh!
-So harsh!

279
00:13:46,980 --> 00:13:47,310
Okay...

280
00:13:47,510 --> 00:13:49,750
-You've gotta get it together man.
-Understood!

281
00:13:49,910 --> 00:13:51,580
-Understood.
-Are you serious?!

282
00:13:51,650 --> 00:13:51,950
Yes.

283
00:13:55,720 --> 00:13:56,450
Let's go.

284
00:13:59,190 --> 00:14:04,230
I think it might be time to send Fujimon in for a visit. How about it?

285
00:14:04,290 --> 00:14:04,890
Shall I?

286
00:14:04,890 --> 00:14:05,500
- Can you do it?

287
00:14:05,500 --> 00:14:06,130
- W-What should I do?
- Can you do it?

288
00:14:06,130 --> 00:14:06,800
- W-What should I do?

289
00:14:06,800 --> 00:14:06,960
- The mood is so weird.
- W-What should I do?

290
00:14:06,960 --> 00:14:07,960
- The mood is so weird.

291
00:14:08,030 --> 00:14:08,770
I was so surprised.

292
00:14:12,100 --> 00:14:13,440
He's doing it again!!

293
00:14:13,470 --> 00:14:14,840
Is he crazy?!

294
00:14:16,570 --> 00:14:18,740
He might be doing this just to appear busy.

295
00:14:18,740 --> 00:14:19,510
This is crazy, he's on another level.
He might be doing this just to appear busy.

296
00:14:19,510 --> 00:14:21,850
This is crazy, he's on another level.

297
00:14:21,850 --> 00:14:22,280
You'd never think he was sane!
This is crazy, he's on another level.

298
00:14:22,280 --> 00:14:23,580
You'd never think he was sane!

299
00:14:26,150 --> 00:14:26,720
He's not doing it?

300
00:14:26,720 --> 00:14:26,980
He's not doing it!!
He's not doing it?

301
00:14:26,980 --> 00:14:27,650
He's not doing it!!

302
00:14:27,820 --> 00:14:28,850
He ain't doing it!

303
00:14:29,650 --> 00:14:30,790
Just forget about the script!

304
00:14:30,790 --> 00:14:31,620
This is bananas!
Just forget about the script!

305
00:14:31,620 --> 00:14:32,620
This is bananas!

306
00:14:32,690 --> 00:14:34,290
That's done!
Move on!

307
00:14:34,890 --> 00:14:35,990
This is tough to watch!

308
00:14:36,530 --> 00:14:39,160
-It's over already!
-Move past it!

309
00:14:42,130 --> 00:14:44,670
Alright Shingo, would you like to go next?

310
00:14:44,670 --> 00:14:45,000
Yes.

311
00:14:48,970 --> 00:14:50,140
Alright, go ahead.

312
00:14:55,080 --> 00:14:55,780
Fujimoto...

313
00:14:55,780 --> 00:14:56,380
Hello.

314
00:14:56,450 --> 00:14:58,880
-Hello.
-It's been a while.

315
00:15:00,520 --> 00:15:01,380
You were over there, huh?

316
00:15:01,480 --> 00:15:02,750
Of course, I've been here all this time.

317
00:15:03,120 --> 00:15:05,190
Everyone has been working really hard.

318
00:15:05,520 --> 00:15:06,820
But let's do something else.

319
00:15:07,090 --> 00:15:07,990
How about a game?

320
00:15:08,190 --> 00:15:09,530
-Right.
-Let's do it.

321
00:15:10,030 --> 00:15:10,560
I'm ready.

322
00:15:10,590 --> 00:15:11,590
Alright, oh...

323
00:15:11,930 --> 00:15:14,860
-Please go ahead.
-This is the last one, come out!

324
00:15:25,840 --> 00:15:29,780
I am Sho Ayanokoji. My salary was 70 '000 yen last month.

325
00:15:33,080 --> 00:15:33,650
Cut!

326
00:15:33,920 --> 00:15:34,920
Thank you.

327
00:15:34,980 --> 00:15:35,550
That was great.

328
00:15:35,820 --> 00:15:36,390
-It suits you.
-It suits you.

329
00:15:37,120 --> 00:15:38,290
You look like the real Sho.

330
00:15:39,590 --> 00:15:40,790
Well, should we...

331
00:15:42,460 --> 00:15:43,730
The mood is strange now, isn't it?

332
00:15:45,360 --> 00:15:45,860
You're right...

333
00:15:45,860 --> 00:15:46,030
I mean, after you've finished with all this...
You're right...

334
00:15:46,030 --> 00:15:47,260
I mean, after you've finished with all this...

335
00:15:47,400 --> 00:15:49,900
-You know what I mean?
-I wonder what it is...

336
00:15:50,170 --> 00:15:51,300
I'm sorry...

337
00:15:51,300 --> 00:15:51,670
The room goes silent, you can hear a pin drop.
I'm sorry...

338
00:15:51,670 --> 00:15:54,340
The room goes silent, you can hear a pin drop.

339
00:15:54,800 --> 00:15:55,240
Right?

340
00:15:56,710 --> 00:16:00,740
But you know, Fujimon has been in these kinds of situations before.

341
00:16:01,080 --> 00:16:03,950
And he's actually pretty good at acting.

342
00:16:03,950 --> 00:16:04,950
Not at all.
And he's actually pretty good at acting.

343
00:16:04,950 --> 00:16:05,380
Not at all.

344
00:16:05,520 --> 00:16:07,150
-How about you give it a go?
-We don't need to.

345
00:16:07,320 --> 00:16:08,350
Just once, please.

346
00:16:08,790 --> 00:16:11,690
I mean, you guys just get into this strange groove after a while.

347
00:16:11,790 --> 00:16:14,090
We won't, you have to trust me.

348
00:16:15,530 --> 00:16:15,930
I mean...

349
00:16:16,490 --> 00:16:17,790
You don't want to see me do that, right?

350
00:16:18,660 --> 00:16:19,730
Why aren't you speaking?

351
00:16:19,760 --> 00:16:21,900
-Well, we do want to see you try.
-Of course.

352
00:16:24,500 --> 00:16:29,770
Hold on, you've all done it already.
Including Katori.

353
00:16:30,240 --> 00:16:31,440
So it's enough already.

354
00:16:31,770 --> 00:16:33,580
You've been doing the same stuff over and over.

355
00:16:34,080 --> 00:16:34,680
Right, Oyakata?

356
00:16:36,080 --> 00:16:38,210
But Oyakata just expressed his desire to see you try it out.

357
00:16:38,210 --> 00:16:38,380
Don't you think that's enough?
But Oyakata just expressed his desire to see you try it out.

358
00:16:38,380 --> 00:16:39,050
Don't you think that's enough?

359
00:16:39,680 --> 00:16:40,250
Really?

360
00:16:40,380 --> 00:16:41,950
Hey! You're doing that again?!

361
00:16:42,320 --> 00:16:43,220
Huh? Did he just...

362
00:16:45,150 --> 00:16:46,960
He just laughed...

363
00:16:47,320 --> 00:16:47,690
Who?

364
00:16:48,730 --> 00:16:49,190
Who was it?

365
00:16:49,930 --> 00:16:51,160
Didn't he just laugh?

366
00:16:51,690 --> 00:16:52,630
He was making a joke...

367
00:16:53,700 --> 00:16:54,230
Huh?

368
00:16:55,160 --> 00:16:55,770
Who?

369
00:16:56,370 --> 00:16:58,370
You laughed, didn't you?

370
00:17:00,200 --> 00:17:01,100
Come on...

371
00:17:01,870 --> 00:17:03,510
He laughed at his own joke!

372
00:17:03,510 --> 00:17:03,770
But he's acting like he didn't laugh.
He laughed at his own joke!

373
00:17:03,770 --> 00:17:05,380
But he's acting like he didn't laugh.

374
00:17:06,480 --> 00:17:07,210
Was it Katori?

375
00:17:07,240 --> 00:17:07,640
- He definitely laughed.

376
00:17:07,640 --> 00:17:09,210
- I think you're out this time.
- He definitely laughed.

377
00:17:09,210 --> 00:17:10,210
- I think you're out this time.

378
00:17:10,880 --> 00:17:11,680
I mean, you were laughing!

379
00:17:12,050 --> 00:17:13,420
Sorry, I didn't catch it.

380
00:17:13,880 --> 00:17:14,620
Really?!

381
00:17:14,850 --> 00:17:15,450
Who was it?

382
00:17:15,950 --> 00:17:19,790
It was Katori.
He laughed at his own joke.

383
00:17:19,990 --> 00:17:22,590
If that's true... Then he's out, you know?

384
00:17:23,230 --> 00:17:24,290
Not like this!

385
00:17:24,460 --> 00:17:25,260
I mean...

386
00:17:26,700 --> 00:17:28,870
- He set up the joke and ended up laughing!

387
00:17:28,870 --> 00:17:29,800
- I will be the judge of that.
- He set up the joke and ended up laughing!

388
00:17:29,800 --> 00:17:30,870
- I will be the judge of that.

389
00:17:31,170 --> 00:17:32,740
I mean, he did laugh.

390
00:17:33,440 --> 00:17:34,740
Alright, let's have a look.

391
00:17:34,840 --> 00:17:35,710
He laughed!

392
00:17:35,840 --> 00:17:37,010
Don't give me that!

393
00:17:39,510 --> 00:17:41,640
But Oyakata just expressed his desire to see you try it out.

394
00:17:41,640 --> 00:17:41,910
Don't you think that's enough?
But Oyakata just expressed his desire to see you try it out.

395
00:17:41,910 --> 00:17:42,580
Don't you think that's enough?

396
00:17:43,110 --> 00:17:43,680
Really?

397
00:17:43,850 --> 00:17:45,380
Hey! You're doing that again?!

398
00:17:45,750 --> 00:17:46,680
Huh? Did he just...

399
00:17:48,280 --> 00:17:48,720
I'm not seeing it.

400
00:17:48,820 --> 00:17:49,590
-Right?
-He laughed.

401
00:17:49,720 --> 00:17:50,620
Hold on, I'm not sure.

402
00:17:52,120 --> 00:17:52,920
I didn't laugh.

403
00:17:52,960 --> 00:17:54,590
But you did.

404
00:17:56,030 --> 00:17:57,760
I really don't know about this one.

405
00:17:57,790 --> 00:17:59,200
Don't we have another angle?

406
00:17:59,860 --> 00:18:00,700
I don't think he laughed.

407
00:18:01,730 --> 00:18:02,770
No way, he did.

408
00:18:03,670 --> 00:18:04,630
I didn't.

409
00:18:05,130 --> 00:18:06,240
You didn't, right?

410
00:18:06,270 --> 00:18:06,600
Yes.

411
00:18:07,240 --> 00:18:08,240
No, no, no!

412
00:18:08,270 --> 00:18:09,070
Seriously?!

413
00:18:09,270 --> 00:18:11,610
We don't have additional footage!

414
00:18:12,140 --> 00:18:14,110
Do you guys have it?

415
00:18:14,410 --> 00:18:16,510
We don't!
The main camera didn't catch it, sorry!

416
00:18:16,510 --> 00:18:16,850
You didn't get it?!
We don't!
The main camera didn't catch it, sorry!

417
00:18:16,850 --> 00:18:17,350
You didn't get it?!

418
00:18:17,610 --> 00:18:18,410
What?!

419
00:18:20,120 --> 00:18:20,620
No way...

420
00:18:20,750 --> 00:18:22,720
I think Oyakata has the best look.

421
00:18:22,720 --> 00:18:23,020
Oyakata, what do you think?
I think Oyakata has the best look.

422
00:18:23,020 --> 00:18:23,650
Oyakata, what do you think?

423
00:18:23,650 --> 00:18:24,050
I-I didn't really see his face.
Oyakata, what do you think?

424
00:18:24,050 --> 00:18:25,420
I-I didn't really see his face.

425
00:18:25,520 --> 00:18:26,120
Why?!

426
00:18:27,220 --> 00:18:28,290
What do you mean?!

427
00:18:28,630 --> 00:18:29,560
You were looking at him!

428
00:18:29,590 --> 00:18:30,960
I just sensed his presence.

429
00:18:31,390 --> 00:18:32,160
Alright then.

430
00:18:32,200 --> 00:18:33,760
I'm gonna be super strict on him, okay?

431
00:18:33,760 --> 00:18:35,970
-He's out if he slips up even for a second.
-Right.

432
00:18:36,030 --> 00:18:39,270
-Alright then.
-It would've been weird if he got no penalties for that.

433
00:18:39,340 --> 00:18:41,270
I mean, you started all of this.

434
00:18:42,440 --> 00:18:44,340
Why am I the bad guy?

435
00:18:49,510 --> 00:18:49,850
- I didn't laugh.

436
00:18:49,850 --> 00:18:50,180
- We can't do much about this situation.
- I didn't laugh.

437
00:18:50,180 --> 00:18:51,050
- We can't do much about this situation.

438
00:18:51,050 --> 00:18:52,220
But you did laugh.

439
00:18:52,380 --> 00:18:53,120
Honestly...

440
00:18:53,650 --> 00:18:55,180
You can tell me the truth later.

441
00:18:55,450 --> 00:18:56,850
You don't have to tell me now.

442
00:18:57,050 --> 00:18:57,620
Alright.

443
00:18:58,990 --> 00:19:00,520
But I swear you laughed...

444
00:19:01,160 --> 00:19:03,390
B-But... W-Well...

445
00:19:03,790 --> 00:19:04,330
Well?!

446
00:19:05,430 --> 00:19:06,530
What is that supposed to mean?!

447
00:19:06,700 --> 00:19:07,530
What was that?!

448
00:19:08,930 --> 00:19:09,730
Now?!

449
00:19:12,370 --> 00:19:13,300
Now's not the time.

450
00:19:14,570 --> 00:19:16,440
-Oyakata...
-You farted again?

451
00:19:18,740 --> 00:19:20,180
You didn't laugh this time.

452
00:19:21,040 --> 00:19:24,110
But your timing was a bit off, Oyakata.

453
00:19:25,350 --> 00:19:28,050
-How come you're all silent all of a sudden.
-Yes...

454
00:19:28,320 --> 00:19:29,720
Didn't he just laugh?!

455
00:19:30,190 --> 00:19:31,120
-He didn't.
-Really?

456
00:19:31,590 --> 00:19:32,820
He didn't laugh?!

457
00:19:32,820 --> 00:19:34,860
Why are you covering for each other?

458
00:19:35,260 --> 00:19:37,990
I mean, you're not exactly enemies but...

459
00:19:38,390 --> 00:19:38,730
Right?

460
00:19:38,730 --> 00:19:41,600
-This is a battle.
-You're in a battle, right?

461
00:19:42,300 --> 00:19:43,830
-Protecting each other is kind of a strange choice.
-Right.

462
00:19:43,930 --> 00:19:44,130
Yeah.

463
00:19:44,200 --> 00:19:48,200
Alright, there's a strange vibe going on so let's pick up the pace!

464
00:19:48,540 --> 00:19:50,070
-Let's have some fun, okay?
-Yes!

465
00:19:50,110 --> 00:19:50,740
Alright!

466
00:19:50,740 --> 00:19:52,240
Why don't we play with this?

467
00:19:52,510 --> 00:19:54,780
Like a test of courage.
And the one who gets the closest wins.

468
00:19:55,450 --> 00:19:59,150
Or we can also play rock, paper, scissors, hammer, helmet.

469
00:19:59,950 --> 00:20:00,420
Okay?

470
00:20:00,620 --> 00:20:01,150
That sounds good.

471
00:20:01,280 --> 00:20:02,150
You guys haven't played it, have you?

472
00:20:02,150 --> 00:20:04,450
What about you Oyakata, have you played before?

473
00:20:04,490 --> 00:20:04,820
Yes.

474
00:20:05,590 --> 00:20:06,020
This one, right?

475
00:20:06,560 --> 00:20:06,990
Which one?

476
00:20:07,060 --> 00:20:07,590
Rock, paper, scissors?

477
00:20:09,030 --> 00:20:10,290
-And then...
-What?

478
00:20:10,960 --> 00:20:11,530
And then you hit.

479
00:20:11,990 --> 00:20:13,960
And the other person covers themselves with a helmet.

480
00:20:14,360 --> 00:20:15,800
The winner gets to hit.

481
00:20:15,930 --> 00:20:16,200
Right.

482
00:20:16,500 --> 00:20:17,930
And the loser has to wear the helmet.

483
00:20:18,300 --> 00:20:19,500
And we go back and forth.

484
00:20:19,740 --> 00:20:19,940
Alright.

485
00:20:20,670 --> 00:20:21,770
-Okay then.
-Great.

486
00:20:21,770 --> 00:20:24,040
-Oyakata is always up for anything, isn't he.
-Yes.

487
00:20:24,710 --> 00:20:26,180
He never refuses.

488
00:20:26,280 --> 00:20:26,510
Yes.

489
00:20:26,840 --> 00:20:27,140
Alright.

490
00:20:27,910 --> 00:20:30,880
-Sorry.
-Sorry.
-But there's only one helmet.

491
00:20:31,080 --> 00:20:33,480
-How come no one is laughing?
-Right?

492
00:20:33,520 --> 00:20:34,280
Right?

493
00:20:36,250 --> 00:20:37,450
-Alright, let's do it.
-Let's play.

494
00:20:37,520 --> 00:20:38,090
-Alright.
-Let's go.

495
00:20:38,120 --> 00:20:39,120
-Let's!
-Let's go!

496
00:20:39,360 --> 00:20:39,890
- We always play these kinds of games.

497
00:20:39,890 --> 00:20:42,390
- I really think Oyakata is extremely funny.
- We always play these kinds of games.

498
00:20:42,390 --> 00:20:43,560
- I really think Oyakata is extremely funny.

499
00:20:43,590 --> 00:20:44,530
You're right.

500
00:20:44,790 --> 00:20:46,530
-Let's go with this hammer.
-Which one?

501
00:20:46,800 --> 00:20:47,530
Oh, you're right.

502
00:20:47,700 --> 00:20:48,560
Oh, we also had the Harisen.

503
00:20:48,560 --> 00:20:48,930
He's inflating it again!
Oh, we also had the Harisen.

504
00:20:48,930 --> 00:20:50,630
He's inflating it again!

505
00:20:51,270 --> 00:20:52,030
Alright, let's play!

506
00:20:52,440 --> 00:20:53,670
I'll go first then.

507
00:20:54,570 --> 00:20:55,300
-I...
-Hiro!

508
00:20:56,110 --> 00:20:56,570
Here I go!

509
00:20:56,570 --> 00:20:56,940
Alright, Mr. Baseball!
Here I go!

510
00:20:56,940 --> 00:20:57,370
Alright, Mr. Baseball!

511
00:20:57,540 --> 00:20:57,910
Alright.

512
00:20:59,480 --> 00:21:00,310
-Can you do it?
-Yes.

513
00:21:01,910 --> 00:21:02,910
-Alright, let's get fired up.
-Yes!

514
00:21:02,910 --> 00:21:03,410
-Yeah!
-Yeah!
-Alright, let's get fired up.
-Yes!

515
00:21:03,410 --> 00:21:03,710
-Yeah!
-Yeah!

516
00:21:04,210 --> 00:21:04,780
Come on!

517
00:21:04,810 --> 00:21:06,150
-Alright.
-Here we go!

518
00:21:06,380 --> 00:21:07,020
-Rock..!
-Rock..!

519
00:21:07,050 --> 00:21:07,820
Ready? Go!

520
00:21:07,850 --> 00:21:09,550
Rock, paper, scissors, hammer, helmet!

521
00:21:09,850 --> 00:21:10,420
Rack...

522
00:21:10,820 --> 00:21:11,720
Did you just say 'rack'?

523
00:21:14,920 --> 00:21:15,890
He totally slipped.

524
00:21:15,890 --> 00:21:15,990
'Rack'?
He totally slipped.

525
00:21:15,990 --> 00:21:16,760
'Rack'?

526
00:21:16,830 --> 00:21:17,390
Uh-oh.

527
00:21:17,790 --> 00:21:18,690
Is he safe?

528
00:21:18,960 --> 00:21:20,000
No way, he's out.

529
00:21:20,700 --> 00:21:21,930
He can't run away from this!

530
00:21:22,930 --> 00:21:23,800
He was having so much fun.

531
00:21:25,500 --> 00:21:26,140
I mean...

532
00:21:27,200 --> 00:21:29,540
You're just staring right at me!

533
00:21:29,710 --> 00:21:31,840
You were having too much fun playing the game.

534
00:21:32,710 --> 00:21:33,640
You really laughed.

535
00:21:34,910 --> 00:21:36,210
He's right, he's totally right.

536
00:21:36,210 --> 00:21:38,950
Everyone in the back agrees.

537
00:21:39,380 --> 00:21:39,850
Yes.

538
00:21:42,350 --> 00:21:43,590
-Alright, let's get fired up.
-Yes!

539
00:21:44,620 --> 00:21:45,020
Come on!

540
00:21:45,120 --> 00:21:46,420
-Alright.
-Here we go!

541
00:21:46,760 --> 00:21:47,290
-Rock..!
-Rock..!

542
00:21:47,320 --> 00:21:48,160
Ready? Go!

543
00:21:48,190 --> 00:21:49,790
Rock, paper, scissors, hammer, helmet!

544
00:21:50,230 --> 00:21:50,790
Rack...

545
00:21:51,190 --> 00:21:51,960
Did you just say 'rack'?

546
00:21:56,100 --> 00:21:57,500
It's undeniable!

547
00:21:57,530 --> 00:21:58,200
Hold on, hold on...

548
00:21:58,230 --> 00:21:58,900
This...

549
00:21:58,900 --> 00:21:59,970
It's undeniable.

550
00:21:59,970 --> 00:22:00,200
He was already smiling at the beginning of the game!
It's undeniable.

551
00:22:00,200 --> 00:22:02,570
He was already smiling at the beginning of the game!

552
00:22:02,610 --> 00:22:04,740
You were so happy to be playing!

553
00:22:05,240 --> 00:22:05,610
No way!

554
00:22:05,610 --> 00:22:06,180
Like you were a boy on a school trip!
No way!

555
00:22:06,180 --> 00:22:07,780
Like you were a boy on a school trip!

556
00:22:08,780 --> 00:22:10,280
I wasn't enjoying it that much!

557
00:22:10,410 --> 00:22:12,480
-But Kamiji was still unscathed.
-Oh, really?

558
00:22:12,480 --> 00:22:14,380
So he'll be getting a yellow card.

559
00:22:14,380 --> 00:22:14,820
Understood.

560
00:22:14,920 --> 00:22:16,120
So he's still safe.

561
00:22:16,620 --> 00:22:17,520
Thank you..?

562
00:22:17,690 --> 00:22:17,990
Alright!

563
00:22:17,990 --> 00:22:19,220
-From now on...
-I'll be careful!

564
00:22:24,160 --> 00:22:25,330
But Katori also laughed...

565
00:22:25,730 --> 00:22:26,600
-Huh?
-Huh?

566
00:22:26,900 --> 00:22:28,530
Katori laughed earlier, you know?

567
00:22:29,000 --> 00:22:29,870
You're still on about that?

568
00:22:29,930 --> 00:22:30,370
On no...

569
00:22:30,770 --> 00:22:32,600
The stares between these two could kill!

570
00:22:35,470 --> 00:22:36,170
Let's keep going then.

571
00:22:36,410 --> 00:22:36,870
Let's do it!

572
00:22:37,540 --> 00:22:39,280
-Alright...
-Let's go with them.

573
00:22:39,910 --> 00:22:41,610
-Oh, the battle of the pompadours.
-Battle of the pompadours.

574
00:22:41,810 --> 00:22:43,780
Who has the strongest pompadour?

575
00:22:43,780 --> 00:22:44,080
Alright.

576
00:22:44,310 --> 00:22:46,380
Alright then, this is the battle of the pompadours.

577
00:22:46,520 --> 00:22:47,020
Let's go.

578
00:22:47,420 --> 00:22:48,380
Ready? Go!

579
00:22:48,380 --> 00:22:49,890
-Rock, paper, scissors, hammer, helmet!
-Rock, paper, scissors, hammer, helmet!

580
00:22:50,550 --> 00:22:51,920
-Rock, paper, scissors, hammer, helmet!
-Rock, paper, scissors, hammer, helmet!

581
00:22:52,220 --> 00:22:53,590
-Rock, paper, scissors, hammer, helmet!
-Rock, paper, scissors, hammer, helmet!

582
00:22:55,090 --> 00:22:55,790
Huh?!

583
00:22:57,990 --> 00:22:58,790
You're so bad!

584
00:22:59,130 --> 00:22:59,600
He's too kind.

585
00:22:59,600 --> 00:23:00,130
So bad!
He's too kind.

586
00:23:00,130 --> 00:23:00,160
He's too kind.

587
00:23:00,330 --> 00:23:01,200
So bad!

588
00:23:03,430 --> 00:23:03,870
I mean...

589
00:23:04,670 --> 00:23:06,140
But he's making the face of a winner.

590
00:23:07,070 --> 00:23:08,100
You're so bad at this.

591
00:23:09,340 --> 00:23:10,070
Can we go again?

592
00:23:10,470 --> 00:23:11,240
You can't.

593
00:23:12,170 --> 00:23:13,380
That loss was pathetic.

594
00:23:15,110 --> 00:23:19,220
You're actually blocking, what I personally think is the best angle.

595
00:23:23,250 --> 00:23:23,720
Sorry.

596
00:23:23,720 --> 00:23:24,590
We need that footage.

597
00:23:25,090 --> 00:23:26,220
Oh, sorry, sorry.

598
00:23:26,860 --> 00:23:28,790
-So you lost because you were worried about that, right?
-Okay, let's go again.

599
00:23:29,230 --> 00:23:30,460
-Alright then.
-He couldn't concentrate.

600
00:23:31,030 --> 00:23:31,630
Let's go again.

601
00:23:31,690 --> 00:23:31,990
Sure.

602
00:23:33,000 --> 00:23:33,500
Let's go.

603
00:23:33,560 --> 00:23:34,560
Ready? Go!

604
00:23:34,600 --> 00:23:36,000
-Rock, paper, scissors, hammer, helmet!
-Rock, paper, scissors, hammer, helmet!

605
00:23:36,330 --> 00:23:37,870
-Rock, paper, scissors, hammer, helmet!
-Rock, paper, scissors, hammer, helmet!

606
00:23:38,970 --> 00:23:40,040
You're so bad!

607
00:23:42,640 --> 00:23:43,970
Are you even trying?

608
00:23:48,040 --> 00:23:48,710
Are you?

609
00:23:48,980 --> 00:23:50,210
Look at Oyakata's face!

610
00:23:50,310 --> 00:23:52,980
I mean, Katori, are you even trying to win?

611
00:23:53,080 --> 00:23:55,480
I've always been like this...

612
00:23:58,020 --> 00:23:59,020
Always been?

613
00:23:59,120 --> 00:24:00,020
Always...

614
00:24:00,690 --> 00:24:01,290
What does that even mean?

615
00:24:02,790 --> 00:24:05,360
This is the type of idol I am.

616
00:24:06,730 --> 00:24:10,130
That's why Kin-chan likes me. (EN: 6)

617
00:24:10,700 --> 00:24:13,870
Can't we go again?
Let's just do a speed round.

618
00:24:14,270 --> 00:24:17,140
-I'm not doing this on purpose.
-What the hell are they saying?

619
00:24:17,610 --> 00:24:21,110
It's just that Kin-chan prefers simplicity.

620
00:24:21,940 --> 00:24:23,210
Kin-chan is coming up quite a lot.

621
00:24:23,310 --> 00:24:24,880
You're very analytical.

622
00:24:25,280 --> 00:24:27,050
Right, he's doing some crazy self-analysis.

623
00:24:27,050 --> 00:24:27,250
Should you even be saying this stuff?
Right, he's doing some crazy self-analysis.

624
00:24:27,250 --> 00:24:27,720
Should you even be saying this stuff?

625
00:24:27,720 --> 00:24:28,450
Kin-chan prefers the clumsy version of Shingo.
Should you even be saying this stuff?

626
00:24:28,450 --> 00:24:31,190
Kin-chan prefers the clumsy version of Shingo.

627
00:24:31,620 --> 00:24:33,220
I don't think you should be the one saying that.

628
00:24:33,760 --> 00:24:34,320
Kin-chan...

629
00:24:35,020 --> 00:24:35,730
Kin-chan?

630
00:24:35,890 --> 00:24:36,390
Kin-chan?

631
00:24:36,490 --> 00:24:37,990
You've been going on and on about Kin-chan for a while...

632
00:24:38,830 --> 00:24:43,670
"Now, I will ask all of you to kill each other"

633
00:24:49,240 --> 00:24:49,740
Hold on.

634
00:24:51,170 --> 00:24:52,340
They ain't doing that!

635
00:24:53,040 --> 00:24:54,780
It's just rock, paper, scissors, dammit!

636
00:24:58,480 --> 00:24:59,450
This guy is mental!

637
00:24:59,450 --> 00:25:00,080
He's so unhinged.
This guy is mental!

638
00:25:00,080 --> 00:25:00,750
He's so unhinged.

639
00:25:00,750 --> 00:25:02,020
Guys, come on.

640
00:25:02,050 --> 00:25:03,050
This guy is mental!

641
00:25:03,090 --> 00:25:03,820
Don't move, don't move!

642
00:25:03,820 --> 00:25:04,090
I've decided!
Don't move, don't move!

643
00:25:04,090 --> 00:25:04,650
I've decided!

644
00:25:05,250 --> 00:25:06,990
Everyone's gotta have that killer instinct.

645
00:25:07,120 --> 00:25:07,320
Yes.

646
00:25:07,360 --> 00:25:08,160
So we're going for real?

647
00:25:08,260 --> 00:25:09,360
We're going all in, right?

648
00:25:09,560 --> 00:25:09,890
Yes.

649
00:25:10,790 --> 00:25:11,360
Right?

650
00:25:11,360 --> 00:25:11,990
-Yes.
-There you go.

651
00:25:13,330 --> 00:25:14,300
It's not a game anymore.

652
00:25:14,700 --> 00:25:16,430
-You have to go in with the intent of killing each other.
-You're right.

653
00:25:16,930 --> 00:25:18,300
Katori, let's drop all the pretense.

654
00:25:19,470 --> 00:25:20,570
-Okay.
-Let's go.

655
00:25:20,570 --> 00:25:21,340
Let's do it seriously.

656
00:25:21,640 --> 00:25:22,510
The stakes are high.

657
00:25:22,510 --> 00:25:23,010
Alright, we'll start once you say the phrase.
The stakes are high.

658
00:25:23,010 --> 00:25:24,970
Alright, we'll start once you say the phrase.

659
00:25:24,970 --> 00:25:25,540
Yes.

660
00:25:26,780 --> 00:25:27,980
Alright, first...

661
00:25:28,340 --> 00:25:30,010
-Now...
-Wait, wait, wait, wait, you're too early.

662
00:25:31,180 --> 00:25:31,610
Yes.

663
00:25:32,310 --> 00:25:33,250
Hold on, look at me.

664
00:25:33,280 --> 00:25:33,820
-Yes.
-Okay.

665
00:25:33,920 --> 00:25:37,290
You'll say your line as I say 'start' and the game will start.

666
00:25:37,350 --> 00:25:38,820
Like the opening of a tournament.

667
00:25:39,360 --> 00:25:39,790
Alright.

668
00:25:40,490 --> 00:25:41,290
Let's go!

669
00:25:42,890 --> 00:25:48,630
"Now, I will ask all of you to kill each other"

670
00:25:49,630 --> 00:25:50,700
He's saying it a bit differently now.

671
00:25:51,400 --> 00:25:52,370
Ready? Go!

672
00:25:52,640 --> 00:25:54,270
-Rock, paper, scissors, hammer, helmet!
-Rock, paper, scissors, hammer, helmet!

673
00:25:54,740 --> 00:25:56,070
-Rock, paper, scissors, hammer, helmet!
-Rock, paper, scissors, hammer, helmet!

674
00:25:56,440 --> 00:25:57,710
-Rock, paper, scissors, hammer, helmet!
-Rock, paper, scissors, hammer, helmet!

675
00:26:00,280 --> 00:26:00,810
Close.

676
00:26:01,410 --> 00:26:02,680
That wasn't close at all!
He lost!

677
00:26:04,350 --> 00:26:04,980
He was humiliated.

678
00:26:05,820 --> 00:26:06,580
And he put it on backwards.

679
00:26:07,480 --> 00:26:08,650
I'm shocked.

680
00:26:09,190 --> 00:26:09,790
Shocked...

681
00:26:09,820 --> 00:26:10,090
Yeah.

682
00:26:11,590 --> 00:26:12,120
I'm sorry.

683
00:26:12,120 --> 00:26:13,990
Let's stop with all the apologies.

684
00:26:15,460 --> 00:26:19,560
I mean, you're just ruining the mood with that stuff.

685
00:26:19,800 --> 00:26:20,030
You feel me?

686
00:26:20,030 --> 00:26:21,830
-Lightly, right?
-Let's keep it light!

687
00:26:22,430 --> 00:26:22,700
- I'm really bad at this...

688
00:26:22,700 --> 00:26:23,870
- Katori... I get that you're bad at the game, but you're spoiling the vibes!
- I'm really bad at this...

689
00:26:23,870 --> 00:26:26,140
- Katori... I get that you're bad at the game, but you're spoiling the vibes!

690
00:26:27,800 --> 00:26:28,500
Shut up!

691
00:26:31,240 --> 00:26:32,310
What's your deal?!

692
00:26:33,910 --> 00:26:34,810
Who do you think you are?!

693
00:26:36,380 --> 00:26:38,810
I am trying my best here!!

694
00:26:39,120 --> 00:26:40,450
From the very start!

695
00:26:40,780 --> 00:26:42,380
Everyone's been trying hard!!

696
00:26:43,050 --> 00:26:44,190
What more do you want?!

697
00:26:44,350 --> 00:26:45,020
Idiot!!

698
00:26:47,490 --> 00:26:48,520
Don't dilly-dally!

699
00:26:49,330 --> 00:26:50,590
Dilly-dally?

700
00:26:50,630 --> 00:26:52,830
I told you not to dilly-dally!

701
00:26:54,660 --> 00:26:55,230
Let's stop this.

702
00:26:55,560 --> 00:26:56,730
I'm being funny!!

703
00:26:56,970 --> 00:26:57,600
"Let's stop".

704
00:26:57,730 --> 00:26:58,570
I'm funny!!

705
00:26:59,800 --> 00:27:00,700
Sorry, sorry.

706
00:27:02,940 --> 00:27:03,710
Dammit!

707
00:27:04,610 --> 00:27:05,440
You're not going hard, huh?

708
00:27:07,210 --> 00:27:07,740
Bastard!

709
00:27:09,210 --> 00:27:09,580
Now, now...

710
00:27:09,780 --> 00:27:10,950
That was so sudden.

711
00:27:11,550 --> 00:27:13,380
Bastard! Bastard! Bastard!

712
00:27:13,780 --> 00:27:15,320
"Now, I will ask..."

713
00:27:17,620 --> 00:27:19,520
Look at Katori!
He just cackled so hard!

714
00:27:19,860 --> 00:27:20,190
Who?

715
00:27:20,190 --> 00:27:20,620
He's cackling!
Who?

716
00:27:20,620 --> 00:27:21,560
He's cackling!

717
00:27:21,860 --> 00:27:22,960
That's a definite out.

718
00:27:23,160 --> 00:27:24,330
Alright!

719
00:27:24,890 --> 00:27:25,690
Let's go!

720
00:27:26,860 --> 00:27:27,660
Thank you!

721
00:27:27,930 --> 00:27:28,960
Thank you!

722
00:27:29,030 --> 00:27:29,900
That was odd.

723
00:27:31,470 --> 00:27:32,300
So strange.

724
00:27:34,170 --> 00:27:36,140
I couldn't hold it in anymore.

725
00:27:36,140 --> 00:27:36,870
Perfect timing!
I couldn't hold it in anymore.

726
00:27:36,870 --> 00:27:37,070
Perfect timing!

727
00:27:39,070 --> 00:27:40,810
You totally laughed.

728
00:27:40,910 --> 00:27:42,010
-I didn't laugh.
-You're getting the red.

729
00:27:42,010 --> 00:27:43,080
I didn't.

730
00:27:43,110 --> 00:27:44,310
He's saying he didn't laugh!

731
00:27:44,310 --> 00:27:47,380
Alright, Fujimon was in here so...

732
00:27:47,550 --> 00:27:47,780
Yes.

733
00:27:47,880 --> 00:27:49,350
Who laughed?

734
00:27:49,850 --> 00:27:50,890
Katori of course!

735
00:27:50,890 --> 00:27:51,050
Are you sure?
Katori of course!

736
00:27:51,050 --> 00:27:51,390
Are you sure?

737
00:27:51,390 --> 00:27:51,720
He cackled in my face!
Are you sure?

738
00:27:51,720 --> 00:27:52,590
He cackled in my face!

739
00:27:52,590 --> 00:27:53,520
-Did you see it?
-I did!

740
00:27:53,520 --> 00:27:54,120
Are you sure?

741
00:27:54,120 --> 00:27:55,220
Y-Yes, I saw it!

742
00:27:55,690 --> 00:27:57,330
I clearly saw it!

743
00:27:57,330 --> 00:27:58,530
He was right in front of me!

744
00:28:02,570 --> 00:28:03,030
Now, now...

745
00:28:03,170 --> 00:28:04,230
That was so sudden.

746
00:28:04,900 --> 00:28:06,800
Bastard! Bastard! Bastard!

747
00:28:07,170 --> 00:28:08,700
"Now, I will ask..."

748
00:28:11,970 --> 00:28:12,910
Look at his lower lip!

749
00:28:13,040 --> 00:28:14,380
He's cracking up!

750
00:28:15,340 --> 00:28:16,980
I can't blame him.

751
00:28:19,210 --> 00:28:20,180
I would have laughed too.

752
00:28:20,180 --> 00:28:20,580
Thank you.
I would have laughed too.

753
00:28:20,580 --> 00:28:21,020
Thank you.

754
00:28:21,080 --> 00:28:22,220
It's undeniable, right?

755
00:28:22,590 --> 00:28:24,150
Katori, you're out!

756
00:28:26,390 --> 00:28:28,190
Damn it!!

757
00:28:34,460 --> 00:28:36,200
I can't deal with Oyakata.

758
00:28:37,070 --> 00:28:38,070
Oyakata is so funny.

759
00:28:38,130 --> 00:28:39,770
-Oyakata is dangerous.
-He's so good!

760
00:28:39,840 --> 00:28:40,440
Amazing!

761
00:28:41,640 --> 00:28:43,640
Alright, Katori is out!

762
00:28:43,640 --> 00:28:44,040
-And Fujimon, let's go home.
-Yes!
Alright, Katori is out!

763
00:28:44,040 --> 00:28:45,510
-And Fujimon, let's go home.
-Yes!

764
00:28:45,510 --> 00:28:46,380
Really?
-And Fujimon, let's go home.
-Yes!

765
00:28:46,380 --> 00:28:46,810
Really?

766
00:28:46,980 --> 00:28:47,440
Yeah.

767
00:28:47,910 --> 00:28:49,710
I can't take those lines anymore!

768
00:28:50,180 --> 00:28:51,250
Good work!

769
00:28:51,280 --> 00:28:53,450
Thank you guys!
-Thanks!

770
00:28:53,450 --> 00:28:55,850
Good work!

771
00:28:56,790 --> 00:29:01,120
You know, I love improvising all those angry rants.

772
00:29:01,420 --> 00:29:02,690
Like the one with Fujimon.

773
00:29:02,860 --> 00:29:05,230
I am trying my best here!!

774
00:29:05,530 --> 00:29:10,600
I had this desire to do tons of these kinds of scenes while I was on Documental.

775
00:29:10,630 --> 00:29:11,870
It just feels so liberating.

776
00:29:12,270 --> 00:29:13,440
It's so good.

777
00:29:14,070 --> 00:29:16,270
And then comes Oyakata.

778
00:29:17,970 --> 00:29:19,880
Bastard! Bastard! Bastard!

779
00:29:20,240 --> 00:29:21,810
"Now, I will ask..."

780
00:29:24,810 --> 00:29:27,580
It's such a shame...

781
00:29:32,990 --> 00:29:33,790
- Here we go!
-Alright!

782
00:29:35,090 --> 00:29:35,690
It's starting.

783
00:29:36,360 --> 00:29:37,130
You know, this thing.

784
00:29:37,190 --> 00:29:38,630
Kobayashi, what should we do now?

785
00:29:38,660 --> 00:29:40,660
Do you still wanna go in?

786
00:29:40,760 --> 00:29:42,970
-Go on.
-I'm just gonna stir the pot.

787
00:29:43,330 --> 00:29:44,900
I don't know if it'll be good though.

788
00:29:45,030 --> 00:29:46,100
Go ahead.

789
00:29:46,470 --> 00:29:48,400
You know, I was actually looking to get some advice.

790
00:29:48,640 --> 00:29:55,110
-More than advice, I wanted you guys to see something.
-Right, sure.

791
00:29:55,110 --> 00:29:56,910
-Would you entertain me for a minute?
-Sure!

792
00:29:56,910 --> 00:29:57,850
What is it?

793
00:29:58,480 --> 00:29:59,280
Over there?

794
00:30:00,080 --> 00:30:00,420
Yes.

795
00:30:00,550 --> 00:30:00,780
Alright.

796
00:30:02,450 --> 00:30:03,190
Is it an image?

797
00:30:03,690 --> 00:30:04,420
Must be.

798
00:30:04,490 --> 00:30:05,050
Right.

799
00:30:05,450 --> 00:30:06,860
It's pretty...

800
00:30:10,560 --> 00:30:11,030
Hello.

801
00:30:11,160 --> 00:30:12,090
-Hello.
-Hi.

802
00:30:12,830 --> 00:30:13,530
Hello.

803
00:30:13,730 --> 00:30:15,130
-Alright guys.
-Yes?

804
00:30:15,460 --> 00:30:21,170
You're all stars in your respective fields, so we're gonna play a game you've never experienced before.

805
00:30:21,240 --> 00:30:21,770
-Oh...
-Sure.

806
00:30:21,840 --> 00:30:22,400
Alright.

807
00:30:22,400 --> 00:30:23,270
It's our only chance!

808
00:30:23,640 --> 00:30:26,340
-You're finally in a variety show, so let's take advantage of that!
-Right.

809
00:30:26,840 --> 00:30:30,450
Without further ado, the first person to fart wins!

810
00:30:31,980 --> 00:30:32,650
Start!

811
00:30:33,250 --> 00:30:36,120
Alright, fart by my ear and you win.

812
00:30:36,150 --> 00:30:37,620
Fart first and you win.

813
00:30:37,650 --> 00:30:38,720
Alright, get your bodies moving!

814
00:30:42,290 --> 00:30:43,730
Oyakata is nodding along.

815
00:30:43,790 --> 00:30:44,990
-He is?
-Yeah.

816
00:30:45,160 --> 00:30:46,360
He was nodding.

817
00:30:47,330 --> 00:30:48,600
Are you ready, Oyakata?

818
00:30:50,230 --> 00:30:52,400
-I was about to fart earlier.
-He said he was about to fart!

819
00:30:54,840 --> 00:30:58,810
There's not a single sign of a fart in me.

820
00:30:59,310 --> 00:31:00,610
I'm gonna beat you guys to it.

821
00:31:01,740 --> 00:31:03,810
Oh, they'll also lose if Kobayashi beats them to it.

822
00:31:04,250 --> 00:31:05,110
I always fart though...

823
00:31:05,110 --> 00:31:05,110
Come on, Hiro!
I always fart though...

824
00:31:05,110 --> 00:31:05,710
Come on, Hiro!

825
00:31:05,810 --> 00:31:07,050
"I always fart though..."

826
00:31:07,050 --> 00:31:08,450
That's hilarious.

827
00:31:08,980 --> 00:31:10,520
I mean, everyone farts.

828
00:31:11,720 --> 00:31:17,490
Oyakata, when you eat that cold Oden...

829
00:31:17,930 --> 00:31:19,060
...did you pretend it was hot?

830
00:31:19,060 --> 00:31:19,600
Yes.

831
00:31:20,100 --> 00:31:20,930
That was quick!

832
00:31:21,330 --> 00:31:22,360
-What a quick response!
-Instantaneous!

833
00:31:23,470 --> 00:31:24,730
That was such a fast reply.

834
00:31:24,800 --> 00:31:25,500
So fast.

835
00:31:25,500 --> 00:31:26,070
Hold on.

836
00:31:26,870 --> 00:31:27,870
-Musaka.
-Yes?

837
00:31:28,200 --> 00:31:30,110
What were those belly tattoos for?

838
00:31:30,570 --> 00:31:34,040
Well, I just thought they were cute.

839
00:31:34,710 --> 00:31:35,610
Just because they were cute?

840
00:31:35,710 --> 00:31:36,080
Yeah.

841
00:31:36,410 --> 00:31:37,080
Don't you agree?

842
00:31:37,310 --> 00:31:37,810
They're nice.

843
00:31:38,810 --> 00:31:39,520
-Right?
-Here I go.

844
00:31:39,520 --> 00:31:40,280
Here it is!

845
00:31:43,090 --> 00:31:43,990
Whoa, amazing.

846
00:31:44,150 --> 00:31:44,820
Amazing!

847
00:31:45,520 --> 00:31:46,360
We've got a winner!

848
00:31:46,490 --> 00:31:47,020
He did it!

849
00:31:48,020 --> 00:31:48,790
He really did!

850
00:31:49,630 --> 00:31:50,890
It must be his youth!

851
00:31:53,100 --> 00:31:55,200
Hiro, are you allowed to do this kinda stuff?

852
00:31:55,200 --> 00:31:55,430
No way!
Hiro, are you allowed to do this kinda stuff?

853
00:31:55,430 --> 00:31:56,230
No way!

854
00:31:56,530 --> 00:31:58,030
He's forcing it!

855
00:31:58,830 --> 00:31:59,300
That was good.

856
00:31:59,300 --> 00:32:00,140
Is he allowed to do that?

857
00:32:00,200 --> 00:32:00,540
Really?

858
00:32:00,540 --> 00:32:01,340
I'm scared for his future.
Really?

859
00:32:01,340 --> 00:32:01,940
I'm scared for his future.

860
00:32:01,970 --> 00:32:02,700
Totally.

861
00:32:02,700 --> 00:32:03,270
It's ominous.
Totally.

862
00:32:03,270 --> 00:32:03,370
It's ominous.

863
00:32:03,370 --> 00:32:03,940
We're still doing the challenge.
It's ominous.

864
00:32:03,940 --> 00:32:04,370
We're still doing the challenge.

865
00:32:06,210 --> 00:32:07,610
Just when I want to, I can't fart.

866
00:32:11,010 --> 00:32:11,280
Huh?

867
00:32:13,280 --> 00:32:14,020
Was that Musaka?

868
00:32:14,480 --> 00:32:15,620
-Was it you?
-Yes.

869
00:32:16,150 --> 00:32:16,890
What?!

870
00:32:16,950 --> 00:32:18,550
-Huh?
-You sure ripped one out!

871
00:32:19,020 --> 00:32:20,220
He smiled!

872
00:32:20,990 --> 00:32:22,990
-After the fart?
-He smiled, right?

873
00:32:23,460 --> 00:32:24,530
-He did, right?
-Yeah.

874
00:32:27,960 --> 00:32:29,630
-Did you just smile as you announced your fart?
-Yes.

875
00:32:31,700 --> 00:32:33,840
He laughed all on his own!

876
00:32:34,540 --> 00:32:36,970
You just smiled as you said: "Yes, I farted".

877
00:32:38,940 --> 00:32:41,240
He laughed at his own fart!

878
00:32:41,240 --> 00:32:42,910
I was just so relieved I got to let it out.

879
00:32:44,580 --> 00:32:45,850
Does that happen?!

880
00:32:47,280 --> 00:32:48,520
-Are you serious.
-So I ended up smiling.

881
00:32:48,920 --> 00:32:50,290
I couldn't look at it properly.

882
00:32:50,290 --> 00:32:50,650
He just smiled normally after the fart.
I couldn't look at it properly.

883
00:32:50,650 --> 00:32:51,890
He just smiled normally after the fart.

884
00:32:52,590 --> 00:32:53,290
He was like: "It was me!".

885
00:32:57,090 --> 00:32:58,460
Just when I want to, I can't fart.

886
00:33:01,900 --> 00:33:02,230
Huh?

887
00:33:04,270 --> 00:33:04,830
Was that Musaka?

888
00:33:05,330 --> 00:33:06,540
-Was it you?
-Yes.

889
00:33:08,040 --> 00:33:09,470
-Huh?
-You sure ripped one out!

890
00:33:10,170 --> 00:33:10,540
He smiled!

891
00:33:11,870 --> 00:33:15,480
-After the fart?
-He smiled, right?

892
00:33:16,610 --> 00:33:18,280
He was smirking moments before.

893
00:33:18,280 --> 00:33:19,210
He sure was.

894
00:33:19,210 --> 00:33:19,780
You're slipping, Oyakata.
He sure was.

895
00:33:19,780 --> 00:33:20,980
You're slipping, Oyakata.

896
00:33:21,080 --> 00:33:21,720
I know.

897
00:33:22,650 --> 00:33:24,290
But honestly, that was pretty funny.

898
00:33:24,350 --> 00:33:26,820
Alright, Oyakata gets an orange card.

899
00:33:26,820 --> 00:33:27,120
Orange!
Alright, Oyakata gets an orange card.

900
00:33:27,120 --> 00:33:27,620
Orange!

901
00:33:27,720 --> 00:33:28,490
At last, your second card!

902
00:33:28,520 --> 00:33:29,390
His second one!

903
00:33:31,290 --> 00:33:32,060
There's only 40 minutes left!

904
00:33:32,060 --> 00:33:33,300
-40 minutes...
-40 minutes...

905
00:33:34,160 --> 00:33:35,860
You know, I'm always farting... Why can't I do it now?

906
00:33:35,860 --> 00:33:36,500
How would we know?!
You know, I'm always farting... Why can't I do it now?

907
00:33:36,500 --> 00:33:37,070
How would we know?!

908
00:33:38,070 --> 00:33:39,800
-We really have no clue.
-That was so close.

909
00:33:44,470 --> 00:33:45,940
Alright, here we go.

910
00:33:46,940 --> 00:33:48,210
Drinking mineral water was super helpful.

911
00:33:48,740 --> 00:33:49,880
Did you drink some?

912
00:33:49,880 --> 00:33:51,750
I did.
I drank about half a bottle.

913
00:33:52,150 --> 00:33:54,950
The gas will slowly travel downwards if you hold your burps.

914
00:33:54,980 --> 00:33:57,420
Hiro was in the middle of it...

915
00:33:58,220 --> 00:34:00,090
So there might be more.

916
00:34:00,290 --> 00:34:01,720
But he's so young.

917
00:34:02,390 --> 00:34:03,960
-His intestines are still young.
-You think that's a factor?

918
00:34:04,530 --> 00:34:05,190
It's so frustrating.

919
00:34:05,490 --> 00:34:06,330
I wanted to fart first.

920
00:34:10,030 --> 00:34:12,200
But those two are taking the longest time.

921
00:34:16,870 --> 00:34:17,270
Here they come.

922
00:34:18,470 --> 00:34:19,140
Does it squeak?

923
00:34:28,780 --> 00:34:29,850
I was just peeing.

924
00:34:29,890 --> 00:34:30,420
Oh.

925
00:34:30,750 --> 00:34:31,320
Sorry.

926
00:34:31,620 --> 00:34:32,650
I would've cracked there.

927
00:34:32,720 --> 00:34:34,820
Sho was getting changed.

928
00:34:34,990 --> 00:34:36,060
Where is the sound coming from?

929
00:34:36,860 --> 00:34:38,090
I think it's from the mouth.

930
00:34:38,290 --> 00:34:39,130
-What's that?
-I think...

931
00:34:39,490 --> 00:34:40,330
Do they sell those?

932
00:34:40,700 --> 00:34:41,830
They do.

933
00:34:42,530 --> 00:34:43,170
Is it a figurine?

934
00:34:43,200 --> 00:34:46,270
You know, I always see Matsumoto on TV...

935
00:34:46,670 --> 00:34:50,240
But he really lifts a ton of weights.

936
00:34:50,240 --> 00:34:53,080
He's got some big arms.
You can even tell through his shirt.

937
00:34:53,740 --> 00:34:55,110
Who does he look like?

938
00:34:55,780 --> 00:34:56,550
It's me!

939
00:34:58,010 --> 00:34:58,950
Isn't it Matsumoto?

940
00:34:59,410 --> 00:35:00,650
-I don't think so.
-Yeah...

941
00:35:08,290 --> 00:35:09,520
What's with this song?

942
00:35:09,890 --> 00:35:10,730
Is it for a cooking show?

943
00:35:10,890 --> 00:35:13,530
No, this one is from Tetsuko Kuroyanagi's...

944
00:35:14,200 --> 00:35:15,130
Wasn't it Tetsuko's Room? (EN: 7)

945
00:35:15,130 --> 00:35:15,960
Tetsuko's Room?

946
00:35:17,400 --> 00:35:19,030
I'm actually on the episode that airs on the 2nd.

947
00:35:19,430 --> 00:35:19,970
Oh, really?

948
00:35:19,970 --> 00:35:21,500
Yes, it's been a while since I've been on.

949
00:35:21,840 --> 00:35:23,110
It airs on the 2nd of June.

950
00:35:24,370 --> 00:35:25,540
Ms. Tetsuko was very healthy.

951
00:35:26,440 --> 00:35:27,310
Where is he?

952
00:35:30,180 --> 00:35:30,510
Who?

953
00:35:30,510 --> 00:35:31,510
Oh, he's here.

954
00:35:31,650 --> 00:35:32,180
Who?

955
00:35:32,250 --> 00:35:33,920
I came all the way from south Asagaya.

956
00:35:34,580 --> 00:35:35,950
Are you one of the Asagaya Sisters? (EN: 8)

957
00:35:35,950 --> 00:35:36,990
He does look like them.

958
00:35:37,350 --> 00:35:38,320
Isn't he a bit too tan?

959
00:35:39,020 --> 00:35:40,360
And very muscular.

960
00:35:40,360 --> 00:35:41,490
I have no idea who this is?

961
00:35:43,830 --> 00:35:45,260
You look like Otake from Summers. (EN: 9)

962
00:35:45,960 --> 00:35:49,530
You look like that old lady who was giving commentary on the Coronavirus pandemic in the early days.

963
00:35:50,670 --> 00:35:51,270
What was her name?

964
00:35:51,330 --> 00:35:52,130
-What's your name?
-What's your name?

965
00:35:58,340 --> 00:35:59,640
-Huh? Did I say something wrong?
-What's going on?

966
00:36:00,280 --> 00:36:00,980
Can we ask your name?

967
00:36:01,740 --> 00:36:04,750
Well, we're on TV right now so...

968
00:36:05,310 --> 00:36:06,680
I can't give you my real name.

969
00:36:08,620 --> 00:36:09,620
Can I give you a nickname instead?

970
00:36:09,750 --> 00:36:10,350
Sure.

971
00:36:14,690 --> 00:36:15,420
I'm Hiromi.

972
00:36:18,030 --> 00:36:18,730
-Hiromi?
-Hiromi?

973
00:36:22,230 --> 00:36:24,770
Her bracelet is very similar to the one Sho was wearing.

974
00:36:25,470 --> 00:36:26,870
That's such a useless statement.

975
00:36:27,400 --> 00:36:29,000
-Come again?
-Her bracelet.

976
00:36:29,370 --> 00:36:29,870
Oh, it looks similar?

977
00:36:30,170 --> 00:36:31,610
Yes, wasn't Sho wearing just one like it?

978
00:36:36,380 --> 00:36:37,550
You know, these are very popular at the moment.

979
00:36:40,280 --> 00:36:41,720
-Is it a fashion statement?
-Yes.

980
00:36:42,750 --> 00:36:43,290
I see.

981
00:36:44,020 --> 00:36:45,220
Oyakata, please ask a question.

982
00:36:46,760 --> 00:36:47,820
She's got a nice body.

983
00:36:48,890 --> 00:36:49,790
She sure does.

984
00:36:49,790 --> 00:36:50,730
She works out.

985
00:36:51,090 --> 00:36:51,790
Thank you.

986
00:36:54,500 --> 00:36:55,400
What's that?

987
00:36:55,860 --> 00:36:59,400
You know, I actually also have a lookalike.

988
00:37:00,870 --> 00:37:01,140
Right...

989
00:37:01,500 --> 00:37:02,400
W-What's that?

990
00:37:02,700 --> 00:37:04,210
I want you to guess who I look like.

991
00:37:04,510 --> 00:37:04,810
Sure.

992
00:37:06,440 --> 00:37:08,440
You'll know once I put this on my face.

993
00:37:08,540 --> 00:37:09,440
Really?

994
00:37:10,710 --> 00:37:12,880
That was like Oyakata's rapper's outfit debacle.

995
00:37:14,250 --> 00:37:15,820
You're right!

996
00:37:16,280 --> 00:37:17,650
-You can do it like this.
-Oh, you're right.

997
00:37:20,020 --> 00:37:21,020
I'm going in.

998
00:37:30,200 --> 00:37:30,830
Right...

999
00:37:31,130 --> 00:37:31,530
Can you tell?

1000
00:37:32,200 --> 00:37:32,600
No...

1001
00:37:32,700 --> 00:37:33,640
Hold on, let me have a better look.

1002
00:37:33,640 --> 00:37:33,900
Hold on.
Hold on, let me have a better look.

1003
00:37:33,900 --> 00:37:34,870
Hold on.

1004
00:37:35,070 --> 00:37:35,470
Who is it?

1005
00:37:35,740 --> 00:37:36,200
Do you know?

1006
00:37:37,410 --> 00:37:37,910
What?

1007
00:37:38,810 --> 00:37:40,480
Is he supposed to look  like someone?

1008
00:37:40,480 --> 00:37:41,540
Yeah, it seems so...

1009
00:37:42,210 --> 00:37:42,910
Are you Japanese?

1010
00:37:43,210 --> 00:37:43,810
Yes, I am.

1011
00:37:43,810 --> 00:37:45,950
With that hairstyle?!

1012
00:37:46,450 --> 00:37:47,620
My name is made up of two Kanji characters.

1013
00:37:47,620 --> 00:37:47,850
Isn't he some sort of panda?
My name is made up of two Kanji characters.

1014
00:37:47,850 --> 00:37:49,250
Isn't he some sort of panda?

1015
00:37:49,450 --> 00:37:50,220
I don't think so.

1016
00:37:51,150 --> 00:37:52,350
-Two Kanji...
-Two Kanji...

1017
00:37:52,890 --> 00:37:53,660
Dan Mitsu?

1018
00:37:53,790 --> 00:37:54,360
Oh no...

1019
00:37:54,460 --> 00:37:54,960
No, no...

1020
00:37:55,590 --> 00:37:56,730
That was weird...

1021
00:37:57,660 --> 00:37:58,390
What was that?

1022
00:37:58,390 --> 00:37:59,260
- He doesn't look anything like her!

1023
00:37:59,260 --> 00:37:59,760
- That's the first funny thing he's said!
- He doesn't look anything like her!

1024
00:37:59,760 --> 00:38:00,730
- That's the first funny thing he's said!

1025
00:38:03,030 --> 00:38:04,770
And we've only got 16 minutes on the clock.

1026
00:38:05,530 --> 00:38:07,200
I just can't remember the name...

1027
00:38:07,540 --> 00:38:08,600
-Do you know who it is?
-Yeah.

1028
00:38:08,740 --> 00:38:10,210
There are too many quizzes!

1029
00:38:11,610 --> 00:38:14,110
Why does Kamiji like quizzes so much?!

1030
00:38:14,910 --> 00:38:16,310
I mean, he got his break on "Quiz Hexagon II".

1031
00:38:16,580 --> 00:38:18,410
Their name is two Kanji characters.

1032
00:38:18,650 --> 00:38:19,650
Right...

1033
00:38:20,050 --> 00:38:21,220
And it's also their stage name.

1034
00:38:22,220 --> 00:38:22,750
I'll give you a hint.

1035
00:38:22,950 --> 00:38:23,220
Alright.

1036
00:38:23,390 --> 00:38:23,690
Pu.

1037
00:38:24,550 --> 00:38:25,050
Pu?

1038
00:38:25,850 --> 00:38:26,420
Pu?

1039
00:38:26,890 --> 00:38:28,960
But he said it's a Japanese person, right?

1040
00:38:28,960 --> 00:38:31,890
I really resemble this person, although that was a long time ago.

1041
00:38:31,890 --> 00:38:32,690
Are they Japanese?

1042
00:38:32,690 --> 00:38:34,630
-They were pretty famous back then.
-He said it was a Japanese person.

1043
00:38:34,860 --> 00:38:35,530
Renho!

1044
00:38:36,430 --> 00:38:36,970
Wrong?

1045
00:38:37,730 --> 00:38:38,470
Are they Japanese?

1046
00:38:38,500 --> 00:38:39,200
They are.

1047
00:38:39,400 --> 00:38:39,840
Pu?

1048
00:38:40,600 --> 00:38:41,040
Pu?

1049
00:38:43,470 --> 00:38:44,110
Chiaki? (EN: 10)

1050
00:38:45,640 --> 00:38:46,370
Correct!

1051
00:38:47,280 --> 00:38:47,580
Huh?

1052
00:38:48,240 --> 00:38:50,310
Does Chiaka have that hairstyle?

1053
00:38:52,480 --> 00:38:53,250
But you don't look like her.

1054
00:38:53,350 --> 00:38:53,680
No way.

1055
00:38:54,980 --> 00:38:55,850
Two Kanji...

1056
00:38:56,020 --> 00:38:56,920
It was two Kanji.

1057
00:38:57,090 --> 00:38:58,650
-Oyakata has already accepted it.
-Two Kanji...

1058
00:38:59,050 --> 00:38:59,750
He's accepted it?

1059
00:39:00,120 --> 00:39:00,860
What?

1060
00:39:01,360 --> 00:39:03,120
I mean, you do look like her.

1061
00:39:03,530 --> 00:39:04,390
I do, don't I?!

1062
00:39:04,390 --> 00:39:04,560
You really do.
I do, don't I?!

1063
00:39:04,560 --> 00:39:04,930
You really do.

1064
00:39:05,060 --> 00:39:05,830
He does?!

1065
00:39:06,290 --> 00:39:07,000
Are you serious?

1066
00:39:07,000 --> 00:39:07,430
- Ton of people tell me I look like her.

1067
00:39:07,430 --> 00:39:08,900
- This guy is on another level!
- Ton of people tell me I look like her.

1068
00:39:08,900 --> 00:39:09,400
- This guy is on another level!

1069
00:39:09,800 --> 00:39:11,670
He's not sane!

1070
00:39:14,600 --> 00:39:15,700
He doesn't look like her!

1071
00:39:15,700 --> 00:39:15,970
He's crazy!
He doesn't look like her!

1072
00:39:15,970 --> 00:39:17,240
He's crazy!

1073
00:39:18,440 --> 00:39:21,180
It's from when I used to work with Ucchan Nanchan.

1074
00:39:24,250 --> 00:39:27,750
-From when you used to be on Pocket Biscuits?
-That's right. (EN: 11)

1075
00:39:29,120 --> 00:39:29,750
Wanna see this?

1076
00:39:30,720 --> 00:39:31,920
You're starting to look like her.

1077
00:39:32,490 --> 00:39:35,590
I want Chiaki and the girl from Asagaya to do something.

1078
00:39:35,590 --> 00:39:35,760
Totally.
I want Chiaki and the girl from Asagaya to do something.

1079
00:39:35,760 --> 00:39:36,420
Totally.

1080
00:39:36,490 --> 00:39:38,490
The girls from south Asagaya.

1081
00:39:38,590 --> 00:39:39,260
Who was she supposed to be?

1082
00:39:39,260 --> 00:39:39,690
I wonder as well...
Who was she supposed to be?

1083
00:39:39,690 --> 00:39:40,400
I wonder as well...

1084
00:39:41,630 --> 00:39:42,460
What's going on now?

1085
00:39:42,700 --> 00:39:44,800
I just wanna show the resemblance.

1086
00:39:46,000 --> 00:39:47,100
He really looks like her, doesn't he?

1087
00:39:47,170 --> 00:39:48,700
With the pose and all.

1088
00:39:49,170 --> 00:39:50,870
-To Chiaki?
-He just took that pic, right?

1089
00:39:51,470 --> 00:39:51,910
He really looks like her.

1090
00:39:51,910 --> 00:39:52,340
Just move past Chiaki!
He really looks like her.

1091
00:39:52,340 --> 00:39:52,810
Just move past Chiaki!

1092
00:39:52,810 --> 00:39:53,540
Oh, sorry.
Just move past Chiaki!

1093
00:39:53,540 --> 00:39:53,610
Just move past Chiaki!

1094
00:39:53,640 --> 00:39:54,280
What was that?

1095
00:39:55,440 --> 00:39:55,940
What was that?

1096
00:39:56,610 --> 00:39:57,210
What was it?

1097
00:39:57,280 --> 00:39:57,810
What was that?

1098
00:39:58,650 --> 00:39:59,910
-The picture.
-On the screen.

1099
00:40:01,950 --> 00:40:03,180
He just took his picture...

1100
00:40:03,180 --> 00:40:03,850
Is this your victory Sake cup? (EN: 12)
He just took his picture...

1101
00:40:03,850 --> 00:40:04,620
Is this your victory Sake cup? (EN: 12)

1102
00:40:04,790 --> 00:40:05,150
Yes.

1103
00:40:05,820 --> 00:40:06,690
Who's that?

1104
00:40:07,220 --> 00:40:07,590
Who is it?

1105
00:40:07,590 --> 00:40:07,860
Isn't that Mori's face?
Who is it?

1106
00:40:07,860 --> 00:40:09,120
Isn't that Mori's face?

1107
00:40:09,790 --> 00:40:10,430
The truth is...

1108
00:40:10,430 --> 00:40:11,160
What?!

1109
00:40:11,660 --> 00:40:13,090
Did he photoshop his own father's face?

1110
00:40:13,660 --> 00:40:15,760
-You also hold out a seabream, right?
-Yeah, a big one.

1111
00:40:16,300 --> 00:40:17,730
Takanohana is doing something.

1112
00:40:17,800 --> 00:40:19,270
-It's pretty heavy.
-Look at him.

1113
00:40:19,670 --> 00:40:20,870
Is he drinking?

1114
00:40:20,870 --> 00:40:21,240
Whoa!

1115
00:40:21,370 --> 00:40:22,040
The victory cup!

1116
00:40:22,070 --> 00:40:22,900
You're kidding me!

1117
00:40:23,840 --> 00:40:25,070
This guy is unreal!

1118
00:40:27,640 --> 00:40:28,640
-It's the victory cup.
-Huh?!

1119
00:40:28,780 --> 00:40:29,380
Is that alcohol?

1120
00:40:29,440 --> 00:40:30,150
Is he drinking alcohol?

1121
00:40:31,380 --> 00:40:32,380
-What?
-What's that?

1122
00:40:33,320 --> 00:40:33,880
Water.

1123
00:40:34,080 --> 00:40:34,850
-Water?!
-Water?!

1124
00:40:36,380 --> 00:40:38,450
-Just tell them it's alcohol!
-It's tasty water.

1125
00:40:38,550 --> 00:40:39,420
He has won.

1126
00:40:39,920 --> 00:40:42,990
It's time for Takanohana's impersonation show!

1127
00:40:43,390 --> 00:40:45,230
First off, we have Takamiyama!

1128
00:40:46,060 --> 00:40:46,830
Twofold! Twofold!

1129
00:40:47,960 --> 00:40:50,030
Next up, Kakuei Tanaka!

1130
00:40:50,970 --> 00:40:52,370
I mean... Well...

1131
00:40:53,370 --> 00:40:54,500
Ehm...

1132
00:40:54,500 --> 00:40:56,740
The island of Japan has to be reconstructed.

1133
00:40:56,940 --> 00:40:58,640
And lastly, Shigeo Nagashima!

1134
00:41:04,110 --> 00:41:05,150
He's in trouble.

1135
00:41:05,480 --> 00:41:05,780
Oh no.

1136
00:41:06,180 --> 00:41:07,020
R-Right...

1137
00:41:07,220 --> 00:41:08,650
-Huh?
-Oh no, oh no!

1138
00:41:09,180 --> 00:41:09,750
Bang bang.

1139
00:41:11,050 --> 00:41:12,250
Oh, that wasn't it.

1140
00:41:13,220 --> 00:41:15,060
You were just doing Gushiken.

1141
00:41:15,090 --> 00:41:15,860
Right...

1142
00:41:17,660 --> 00:41:21,930
"Now, I will ask all of you to kill each other"

1143
00:41:24,600 --> 00:41:25,700
There's only 5 minutes left.

1144
00:41:25,830 --> 00:41:26,600
-What?!
-Only 5 minutes!

1145
00:41:26,600 --> 00:41:27,000
-That's right.

1146
00:41:27,000 --> 00:41:27,300
We've gotta kill each other for real now.
-That's right.

1147
00:41:27,300 --> 00:41:27,870
We've gotta kill each other for real now.

1148
00:41:27,870 --> 00:41:28,870
Yeah, we do.

1149
00:41:29,040 --> 00:41:29,340
He's gone.

1150
00:41:29,340 --> 00:41:29,800
That was close
He's gone.

1151
00:41:29,800 --> 00:41:30,840
That was close

1152
00:41:30,840 --> 00:41:31,740
Some people were about to crack!
That was close

1153
00:41:31,740 --> 00:41:32,270
Some people were about to crack!

1154
00:41:32,270 --> 00:41:32,640
Oyakata is really funny!
Some people were about to crack!

1155
00:41:32,640 --> 00:41:34,640
Oyakata is really funny!

1156
00:41:34,740 --> 00:41:36,510
His talents are wasted here.

1157
00:41:36,510 --> 00:41:36,880
They really are!
His talents are wasted here.

1158
00:41:36,880 --> 00:41:37,880
They really are!

1159
00:41:37,880 --> 00:41:42,020
Don't these guys have the ability to look at the clock?

1160
00:41:42,020 --> 00:41:43,220
They're so carefree.

1161
00:41:43,250 --> 00:41:45,190
- Come on guys, just do something!
- Anything!

1162
00:41:45,190 --> 00:41:46,550
Just do something to the person next to you.

1163
00:41:47,320 --> 00:41:49,620
Make them laugh!

1164
00:41:50,090 --> 00:41:51,090
It's like a boxing match!

1165
00:41:51,090 --> 00:41:52,460
Shoryuken!
It's like a boxing match!

1166
00:41:52,460 --> 00:41:52,490
It's like a boxing match!

1167
00:41:52,830 --> 00:41:53,290
This is the final round guys!

1168
00:41:53,290 --> 00:41:54,600
Shoryuken!
This is the final round guys!

1169
00:41:54,600 --> 00:41:54,660
This is the final round guys!

1170
00:41:55,160 --> 00:41:56,130
Shoryuken!

1171
00:41:56,130 --> 00:41:56,460
This is pretty funny.
Shoryuken!

1172
00:41:56,460 --> 00:41:57,370
This is pretty funny.

1173
00:41:57,500 --> 00:41:58,530
Hadoken!

1174
00:41:58,600 --> 00:41:59,270
It's hilarious.

1175
00:41:59,270 --> 00:41:59,770
Hadoken!

1176
00:41:59,770 --> 00:42:00,470
- Musaka has no clue as to what this is!
Hadoken!

1177
00:42:00,470 --> 00:42:00,600
- Musaka has no clue as to what this is!

1178
00:42:00,600 --> 00:42:02,040
Shoryuken!
- Musaka has no clue as to what this is!

1179
00:42:02,040 --> 00:42:02,070
- Musaka has no clue as to what this is!

1180
00:42:02,440 --> 00:42:02,470
- He doesn't know what a Hadoken is! (EN: 13)

1181
00:42:02,470 --> 00:42:03,610
Shimura-ken!
- He doesn't know what a Hadoken is! (EN: 13)

1182
00:42:03,610 --> 00:42:03,840
- He doesn't know what a Hadoken is! (EN: 13)

1183
00:42:04,110 --> 00:42:06,010
He's not targeting the right people!

1184
00:42:06,010 --> 00:42:06,270
Tanaka-ken!
He's not targeting the right people!

1185
00:42:06,270 --> 00:42:06,880
Tanaka-ken!

1186
00:42:06,880 --> 00:42:07,180
He's just looking at his feet now...
Tanaka-ken!

1187
00:42:07,180 --> 00:42:08,410
He's just looking at his feet now...

1188
00:42:09,210 --> 00:42:10,450
Tanaka-ken!

1189
00:42:10,880 --> 00:42:11,580
Tanaka-ken?

1190
00:42:12,010 --> 00:42:12,550
Tanaka-ken?

1191
00:42:12,550 --> 00:42:13,720
This isn't from his generation.

1192
00:42:16,050 --> 00:42:17,150
Those were a lot of different 'fists'.

1193
00:42:18,650 --> 00:42:19,850
How is everyone doing?

1194
00:42:21,590 --> 00:42:22,420
-Is this Oyakata?
-That's Oyakata.

1195
00:42:22,660 --> 00:42:23,590
We're doing well.

1196
00:42:24,160 --> 00:42:25,930
The results are! (EN: 14)

1197
00:42:25,990 --> 00:42:27,060
It's Hamada!

1198
00:42:28,930 --> 00:42:30,200
Where's Matsumoto?

1199
00:42:31,030 --> 00:42:32,700
-Where's Matsumoto
-No way!

1200
00:42:33,700 --> 00:42:35,370
The results are!

1201
00:42:35,670 --> 00:42:36,240
It's Hamada!

1202
00:42:36,400 --> 00:42:37,670
He's looking for Matsumoto.

1203
00:42:37,870 --> 00:42:39,010
Where did he leave Matsumoto?

1204
00:42:39,310 --> 00:42:39,570
- Do they have the time to do this?

1205
00:42:39,570 --> 00:42:40,540
- "Where's Matsumoto?"
- Do they have the time to do this?

1206
00:42:40,540 --> 00:42:41,180
- "Where's Matsumoto?"

1207
00:42:41,540 --> 00:42:42,640
He's got nothing more to say?

1208
00:42:42,940 --> 00:42:44,450
He asked: "Where is Matsumoto?".

1209
00:42:46,010 --> 00:42:46,880
"What's going on?!"

1210
00:42:47,720 --> 00:42:48,650
"What's going on?!"

1211
00:42:49,780 --> 00:42:50,520
He's isolating.

1212
00:42:52,320 --> 00:42:53,820
I think I had something else prepared.

1213
00:42:54,620 --> 00:42:54,860
Hold on...

1214
00:42:55,220 --> 00:42:55,760
Huh?

1215
00:42:57,090 --> 00:42:58,990
-They have to...
-The results are!

1216
00:42:59,860 --> 00:43:01,560
His voice is so toned down!

1217
00:43:01,760 --> 00:43:03,130
"Where's Matsumoto?"

1218
00:43:03,260 --> 00:43:04,130
No one's listening.

1219
00:43:04,300 --> 00:43:05,330
Keep the Osaka dialect!

1220
00:43:05,330 --> 00:43:05,500
Who is that?
Keep the Osaka dialect!

1221
00:43:05,500 --> 00:43:06,330
Who is that?

1222
00:43:07,900 --> 00:43:08,600
Keep going.

1223
00:43:08,800 --> 00:43:09,940
-He's riding a skateboard.
-Why?

1224
00:43:10,470 --> 00:43:10,970
The skateboard.

1225
00:43:12,070 --> 00:43:12,940
-What's going on?
-What's with the skateboard?

1226
00:43:13,310 --> 00:43:14,110
He was riding that Skateboard.

1227
00:43:14,540 --> 00:43:15,710
You're good.

1228
00:43:17,450 --> 00:43:18,280
Can you ride?

1229
00:43:18,680 --> 00:43:19,510
It's my first time?

1230
00:43:20,380 --> 00:43:21,080
Really?

1231
00:43:21,480 --> 00:43:22,320
Huh? It's your first time?

1232
00:43:22,780 --> 00:43:24,320
Amazing.

1233
00:43:24,950 --> 00:43:26,550
He's trying something with Oyakata.

1234
00:43:27,220 --> 00:43:29,120
-What's up with Musaka's getup?
-Yeah.

1235
00:43:29,260 --> 00:43:30,020
Oh, they fell off.

1236
00:43:34,160 --> 00:43:35,560
-It's starting to get crazy!
-It's getting crazy!

1237
00:43:40,500 --> 00:43:42,000
I sure fooled you all!

1238
00:43:43,440 --> 00:43:44,310
My name is not actually Hiromi!

1239
00:43:44,310 --> 00:43:44,840
Here we go!
My name is not actually Hiromi!

1240
00:43:44,840 --> 00:43:46,610
My name is not actually Hiromi!

1241
00:43:47,380 --> 00:43:48,110
He was pretending!

1242
00:43:48,180 --> 00:43:49,910
I am Sho Ayanokoji!

1243
00:43:52,010 --> 00:43:53,050
Whoa, that hair!

1244
00:43:53,380 --> 00:43:54,380
Look at it.

1245
00:43:54,420 --> 00:43:55,380
What was that?!

1246
00:43:56,150 --> 00:43:58,090
- He ruined his hair for that?!
- What?!

1247
00:43:59,150 --> 00:44:00,320
He even put makeup on.

1248
00:44:00,320 --> 00:44:00,920
He...

1249
00:44:01,320 --> 00:44:02,420
He's normally like that, huh?

1250
00:44:05,890 --> 00:44:06,690
He's done it.

1251
00:44:07,630 --> 00:44:08,330
That's so funny.

1252
00:44:09,830 --> 00:44:10,900
-You got it back so quickly.
-So quick!

1253
00:44:12,100 --> 00:44:14,200
That was very good, theatrically speaking.

1254
00:44:14,240 --> 00:44:15,940
-Really?
-Yes.

1255
00:44:16,040 --> 00:44:18,610
-Alright, only 30 seconds left!
-30 seconds!

1256
00:44:20,340 --> 00:44:21,140
"I'm Mori...

1257
00:44:22,040 --> 00:44:26,450
I smell shit on my hand even though I haven't touched any"

1258
00:44:28,680 --> 00:44:35,220
"I'm Mori...I smell shit on my hand even though I haven't touched any"

1259
00:44:35,520 --> 00:44:38,030
This is all over the place!
There's no structure!

1260
00:44:38,030 --> 00:44:39,530
- And I don't get the skateboard either.
- Right?

1261
00:44:40,300 --> 00:44:42,130
- What's up with the skateboard?
- Why was he riding it?

1262
00:44:42,130 --> 00:44:42,500
- And I don't get Musaka's get up either.
- What's up with the skateboard?
- Why was he riding it?

1263
00:44:42,500 --> 00:44:44,000
- And I don't get Musaka's get up either.

1264
00:44:44,000 --> 00:44:44,400
- And the glasses too...
- And I don't get Musaka's get up either.

1265
00:44:44,400 --> 00:44:44,730
- And the glasses too...

1266
00:44:44,730 --> 00:44:45,300
- Is Musaka a blue demon?
- And the glasses too...

1267
00:44:45,300 --> 00:44:46,300
- Is Musaka a blue demon?

1268
00:44:48,040 --> 00:44:48,970
Oh, it's over!

1269
00:44:51,710 --> 00:44:52,610
It's over!

1270
00:44:52,840 --> 00:44:53,540
We're done.

1271
00:44:54,310 --> 00:44:54,940
Oh my...

1272
00:44:55,440 --> 00:44:56,410
It's over!

1273
00:44:56,480 --> 00:44:57,610
I'm sweating!

1274
00:44:59,950 --> 00:45:01,450
-My ass hurts...
-This was something else.

1275
00:45:01,950 --> 00:45:03,420
It's crazy!

1276
00:45:03,420 --> 00:45:04,720
The length is amazing.

1277
00:45:05,520 --> 00:45:07,220
-It's very creepy.
-That's Hamada, right?

1278
00:45:07,620 --> 00:45:10,190
Nice work everyone!

1279
00:45:10,790 --> 00:45:12,460
That was wonderful!

1280
00:45:13,190 --> 00:45:15,230
Everyone put up a wonderful fight!

1281
00:45:15,630 --> 00:45:17,930
-The end was very good!
-Really?

1282
00:45:18,270 --> 00:45:19,730
That was wonderful!

1283
00:45:19,970 --> 00:45:22,470
You were pretending to be someone else right?

1284
00:45:22,740 --> 00:45:25,710
And then you uncovered your identity at the very last moment.

1285
00:45:25,740 --> 00:45:29,710
But you know... I think I lost something precious in the process.

1286
00:45:30,140 --> 00:45:30,980
No, not at all...

1287
00:45:31,210 --> 00:45:33,480
Alright, let's bring in the other contestants.

1288
00:45:33,580 --> 00:45:34,720
Awesome!

1289
00:45:34,980 --> 00:45:35,750
Good work!

1290
00:45:37,350 --> 00:45:38,450
Good job, guys!

1291
00:45:39,020 --> 00:45:41,220
You all put up a great fight!

1292
00:45:43,190 --> 00:45:44,590
I am touched.

1293
00:45:44,590 --> 00:45:45,090
It was truly amazing.
I am touched.

1294
00:45:45,090 --> 00:45:45,530
It was truly amazing.

1295
00:45:47,330 --> 00:45:48,860
Alright then!

1296
00:45:49,200 --> 00:45:52,830
The winner of Documental is...

1297
00:45:57,370 --> 00:45:59,710
Takanohana Oyakata!

1298
00:46:01,280 --> 00:46:02,740
It's Oyakata!

1299
00:46:03,280 --> 00:46:04,010
Amazing!

1300
00:46:04,750 --> 00:46:06,080
-Awesome!
-Amazing!

1301
00:46:06,080 --> 00:46:07,880
I'm shocked!

1302
00:46:08,020 --> 00:46:09,780
-He was extremely funny.
-Amazing!

1303
00:46:09,780 --> 00:46:10,220
Oyakata, congratulations!!
-He was extremely funny.
-Amazing!

1304
00:46:10,220 --> 00:46:11,520
Oyakata, congratulations!!

1305
00:46:12,050 --> 00:46:12,850
Congrats!

1306
00:46:13,320 --> 00:46:14,090
Does it fit?

1307
00:46:14,890 --> 00:46:15,460
I think so...

1308
00:46:15,460 --> 00:46:15,890
Does it fit?
I think so...

1309
00:46:15,890 --> 00:46:16,320
Does it fit?

1310
00:46:17,330 --> 00:46:19,060
Whoa, that's a tight fit!

1311
00:46:19,230 --> 00:46:20,060
We managed to get it on.

1312
00:46:20,160 --> 00:46:21,830
Here is your prize money!
10,000,000 Yen!

1313
00:46:25,700 --> 00:46:26,400
Oyakata!

1314
00:46:26,730 --> 00:46:27,970
Please take the mask off!

1315
00:46:28,000 --> 00:46:28,440
Yes.

1316
00:46:28,570 --> 00:46:29,600
Right, right.

1317
00:46:29,600 --> 00:46:29,900
Sorry about that.
Right, right.

1318
00:46:29,900 --> 00:46:30,240
Sorry about that.

1319
00:46:30,940 --> 00:46:36,440
He was very close to being kicked out.

1320
00:46:36,480 --> 00:46:38,680
But he barely managed to avoid expulsion.

1321
00:46:39,050 --> 00:46:41,680
Hiro was also trying really hard to keep things going.

1322
00:46:41,680 --> 00:46:42,550
You think so?
Hiro was also trying really hard to keep things going.

1323
00:46:43,050 --> 00:46:44,120
You tried really hard.

1324
00:46:44,120 --> 00:46:44,150
It was very funny.
You tried really hard.

1325
00:46:44,150 --> 00:46:45,350
It was very funny.

1326
00:46:46,020 --> 00:46:48,320
So Katori, how did you feel?

1327
00:46:49,060 --> 00:46:51,930
It was very tough.

1328
00:46:52,690 --> 00:46:55,400
Musaka and Oyakata were just normally conversing at one point.

1329
00:46:55,400 --> 00:46:56,860
That's right!

1330
00:46:57,030 --> 00:46:59,770
They were doing small talk for the longest time!!

1331
00:46:59,800 --> 00:47:01,370
Musaka, what was that thing at the end?

1332
00:47:01,400 --> 00:47:02,940
Right, the blue demon outfit.

1333
00:47:02,970 --> 00:47:06,840
I had actually prepared a Namahage. (EN: 15)

1334
00:47:08,240 --> 00:47:12,710
I had the whole outfit ready, and I was gonna make a joke about Nama Hage (Bald Head).

1335
00:47:12,810 --> 00:47:13,780
But I didn't have time to change...

1336
00:47:13,780 --> 00:47:14,150
I'm glad you didn't!
But I didn't have time to change...

1337
00:47:14,150 --> 00:47:15,550
I'm glad you didn't!

1338
00:47:16,720 --> 00:47:18,620
That would have flopped so hard!

1339
00:47:18,820 --> 00:47:21,060
Today was a great day!

1340
00:47:21,090 --> 00:47:22,290
Congratulations!

1341
00:47:22,520 --> 00:47:23,860
-Congrats!
-Congratulations!

1342
00:47:31,330 --> 00:47:31,700
Here we go.

1343
00:47:33,330 --> 00:47:40,240
I mean, I ended up setting the record for fastest laugh at the beginning...

1344
00:47:40,480 --> 00:47:42,910
-That part looks a bit like my home.
-Oh, really?

1345
00:47:43,810 --> 00:47:44,680
I was desperate.

1346
00:47:47,780 --> 00:47:52,050
I lost my confidence at the first half.
I thought I was gonna get kicked out.

1347
00:47:52,350 --> 00:47:57,490
But Hiro really helped me out a lot to get the jokes right.

1348
00:47:57,490 --> 00:47:57,890
"Now, I will ask all..."
But Hiro really helped me out a lot to get the jokes right.

1349
00:47:57,890 --> 00:47:59,430
"Now, I will ask all..."

1350
00:48:01,260 --> 00:48:04,930
Anyway, I just tried my best to be as stoic as possible.

1351
00:48:06,200 --> 00:48:09,040
"Mama, can I eat this?"

1352
00:48:13,840 --> 00:48:15,110
It was so funny.

1353
00:48:15,980 --> 00:48:17,040
It really was.

1354
00:48:17,950 --> 00:48:21,880
But it was a completely different game than with all the comedians.

1355
00:48:23,550 --> 00:48:24,890
Is that safe?

1356
00:48:26,220 --> 00:48:27,220
-Is it safe?
-Will he be okay?

1357
00:48:27,720 --> 00:48:28,960
No, no, no!

1358
00:48:28,960 --> 00:48:30,590
It's just Frisk.

1359
00:48:30,590 --> 00:48:32,660
-It's Frisk...
-Yeah, but still...

1360
00:48:33,230 --> 00:48:33,900
It's just Frisk.

1361
00:48:33,930 --> 00:48:35,700
Oyakata looks a bit mad.

1362
00:48:36,860 --> 00:48:40,070
I mean, they do say comedians laugh the most.

1363
00:48:40,440 --> 00:48:43,570
Maybe that's why we didn't get many laughs this time.

1364
00:48:43,910 --> 00:48:49,140
But we were laughing our asses off in the back room.

1365
00:48:49,180 --> 00:48:51,950
But there was a monster among them.

1366
00:48:53,280 --> 00:48:55,120
"The results are!"

1367
00:48:55,180 --> 00:48:56,250
It's Hamada!

1368
00:48:57,950 --> 00:48:59,350
"Where's Matsumoto?!"

1369
00:49:00,190 --> 00:49:01,920
- "Where's Matsumoto?!"
- No way!

1370
00:49:02,590 --> 00:49:04,730
"Where's Matsumoto?!"

1371
00:49:04,990 --> 00:49:06,090
Isn't that amazing?

1372
00:49:07,360 --> 00:49:11,170
Where did he come up with that?

1373
00:49:11,700 --> 00:49:13,870
I don't even think Hamada's ever said that before.
