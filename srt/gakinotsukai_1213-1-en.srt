1
00:00:00,700 --> 00:00:06,200
At a certain hot spring, there is an Inn where liars gather

2
00:00:08,500 --> 00:00:12,430
I don't realllly like this series

3
00:00:13,560 --> 00:00:14,730
This series?

4
00:00:14,730 --> 00:00:18,600
You always leave unsatisfied, no matter what

5
00:00:18,600 --> 00:00:20,360
Yeah

6
00:00:20,360 --> 00:00:23,730
But apparently Yamasaki-san is really into this series

7
00:00:23,730 --> 00:00:25,730
It's fun after all

8
00:00:25,730 --> 00:00:28,460
He doesn't have fun at other places

9
00:00:28,460 --> 00:00:29,830
I do!

10
00:00:29,830 --> 00:00:33,300
Time to explain the rules of the Liar's Inn

11
00:00:33,700 --> 00:00:41,160
A card is drawn at random. The person on the card must nominate someone else to tell either a  small, plausible, or massive lie.

12
00:00:41,460 --> 00:00:48,030
The nominated person must improvise everything and maintain the lie!

13
00:00:48,230 --> 00:00:53,230
So, the person to nominate the first liar,

14
00:00:53,230 --> 00:00:54,800
Ah the nominator?

15
00:00:55,260 --> 00:00:56,460
Ah, Endo-san

16
00:00:56,460 --> 00:00:59,100
Endo-san, a plausible lie

17
00:01:00,810 --> 00:01:04,900
This is something I'm worried about,

18
00:01:04,900 --> 00:01:08,350
Tell us about your worries

19
00:01:06,060 --> 00:01:08,350
Yes, I want to tell people,

20
00:01:08,350 --> 00:01:13,100
Matsumoto-san, I've heard you didn't sleep for 52 hours

21
00:01:13,100 --> 00:01:15,360
Really?

22
00:01:14,150 --> 00:01:18,790
Yes really, cause 52 hours is a lot

23
00:01:18,790 --> 00:01:22,500
Actually, I think it was longer than that

24
00:01:22,500 --> 00:01:25,600
Like 57~58 hours I think

25
00:01:26,030 --> 00:01:28,260
Why? You couldn't sleep?

26
00:01:28,260 --> 00:01:30,700
Mahjong Marathon

27
00:01:32,900 --> 00:01:34,530
You've been playing Mahjong?!

28
00:01:34,860 --> 00:01:37,660
A marathon? You play Mahjong?

29
00:01:37,660 --> 00:01:40,360
I suddenly got into it, I learned it last week

30
00:01:40,360 --> 00:01:42,360
You learned last week?

31
00:01:40,960 --> 00:01:44,200
I learned last week, and it's just too much fun

32
00:01:44,200 --> 00:01:45,600
It's so fun now he can't sleep

33
00:01:45,600 --> 00:01:48,930
Even now I can't stop myself doing this

34
00:01:48,930 --> 00:01:52,690
Ah, when you lift the thing

35
00:01:52,690 --> 00:01:56,160
Even if I do this, my other hand starts moving

36
00:01:56,160 --> 00:02:00,600
I can't do just one, the other one moves too

37
00:01:57,960 --> 00:02:00,600
They become synchronised

38
00:02:00,600 --> 00:02:03,600
When you pass 50 hours,

39
00:02:03,600 --> 00:02:07,560
When you do that, this one moves. And when you do this, that one moves.

40
00:02:07,560 --> 00:02:09,600
They become synchronised?

41
00:02:09,600 --> 00:02:12,200
Amazing, just 1 week

42
00:02:10,530 --> 00:02:14,960
You've never done it right?

43
00:02:12,200 --> 00:02:13,860
I have no idea

44
00:02:13,860 --> 00:02:16,080
I don't know about it

45
00:02:16,080 --> 00:02:18,060
What's the best hand?

46
00:02:18,060 --> 00:02:20,330
I keep getting great hands

47
00:02:20,330 --> 00:02:22,150
Yeah so like what for example?

48
00:02:22,150 --> 00:02:25,360
I just say "PON!" all the time

49
00:02:22,150 --> 00:02:25,360
TN: Players call out "Pon!" depending on their hand

50
00:02:26,530 --> 00:02:30,130
If you use "Pon", it usually makes your hand worse

51
00:02:30,130 --> 00:02:31,760
Ahhh yes yes yes yes

52
00:02:31,760 --> 00:02:34,000
If you say "Pon" right?

53
00:02:32,360 --> 00:02:34,000
Yes yes yes, exactly

54
00:02:34,000 --> 00:02:36,760
So you don't say "Pon"?

55
00:02:34,800 --> 00:02:36,760
What have you ever won?!

56
00:02:36,760 --> 00:02:38,760
What have you ever done?!

57
00:02:39,060 --> 00:02:41,740
What goal are you talking about?

58
00:02:40,530 --> 00:02:43,300
Sorry, I mean like, making the hand better

59
00:02:42,300 --> 00:02:45,210
Raising? Right, there are lots of terms for that

60
00:02:45,300 --> 00:02:49,810
I just thought this isn't the time to talk about the rules in detail,

61
00:02:49,810 --> 00:02:54,060
Instead shouldn't you guys ask more about why I'm doing Mahjong Marathons?

62
00:02:54,060 --> 00:02:56,460
Like who I play with and stuff!

63
00:02:56,460 --> 00:02:58,060
Who do you play with?

64
00:02:58,060 --> 00:02:59,960
Who are the regulars?

65
00:03:00,330 --> 00:03:02,430
There's Leah Dizon of course,

66
00:03:03,200 --> 00:03:04,730
That Leah Dizon?

67
00:03:04,730 --> 00:03:06,660
He saw her in a newpaper just now!

68
00:03:07,030 --> 00:03:08,800
Yeah, in the break room!

69
00:03:08,800 --> 00:03:10,530
Coincidentally! (x2)

70
00:03:10,530 --> 00:03:13,640
He's just being influenced by the newspaper!

71
00:03:11,430 --> 00:03:13,640
No no no no

72
00:03:13,640 --> 00:03:17,610
It was just a coincidence, I just met up with her, but like,

73
00:03:17,610 --> 00:03:22,460
If people think there's something going on between us it'll be bothersome for her

74
00:03:20,950 --> 00:03:23,600
So I didn't say anything

75
00:03:22,460 --> 00:03:23,600
Who else is there?

76
00:03:23,600 --> 00:03:25,880
There's also ... Hiroshi Fuse of course

77
00:03:25,880 --> 00:03:27,700
The actor?

78
00:03:28,660 --> 00:03:30,130
You play with the actor?

79
00:03:30,130 --> 00:03:33,290
He does seem like he'd be good at it

80
00:03:31,590 --> 00:03:35,560
And also ... Tiger Jeet Singh

81
00:03:35,560 --> 00:03:38,360
What a cast!

82
00:03:36,660 --> 00:03:38,360
Tiger Jeet Singh?

83
00:03:38,360 --> 00:03:40,360
Sometimes Tiger Jeet Singh isn't there

84
00:03:40,360 --> 00:03:43,240
Tiger Jeet Singh comes and goes

85
00:03:45,130 --> 00:03:46,840
Ah, sorry

86
00:03:46,840 --> 00:03:50,030
I'm so sleepy!!

87
00:03:48,530 --> 00:03:51,510
Well, you didn't sleep after all...

88
00:03:51,510 --> 00:03:53,950
I'm so goddamn sleepy now!

89
00:03:53,950 --> 00:03:57,040
I want to hear more though

90
00:03:54,600 --> 00:03:57,520
I don't think I can, I'm so goddamn sleepy

91
00:03:57,520 --> 00:03:59,720
But I still wanna play!!

92
00:03:58,840 --> 00:04:01,400
Are you gonna play again after this?

93
00:04:00,240 --> 00:04:04,920
Yes. People who've been playing for a long time only play occasionally now

94
00:04:05,440 --> 00:04:09,360
But, since I learned last week, I guess that's how it is

95
00:04:09,360 --> 00:04:13,560
When you learn new things at this age you just get so into it

96
00:04:12,120 --> 00:04:15,240
I can see that

97
00:04:13,880 --> 00:04:16,120
Su-Chi-Mo

98
00:04:16,480 --> 00:04:17,840
Su-Chi-Mo?

99
00:04:17,840 --> 00:04:20,120
It's so Su-Chi-Mo right now

100
00:04:20,120 --> 00:04:24,310
What is Su-Chi-Mo? It's my first time hearing that

101
00:04:22,520 --> 00:04:26,200
It's a catchphrase of mine

102
00:04:26,200 --> 00:04:30,240
A catchphrase you've never said before?

103
00:04:30,240 --> 00:04:35,040
I'M SLEEPY! SHUT UP! I wanna sleep!

104
00:04:32,280 --> 00:04:35,040
Please just elaborate on your favourite hand

105
00:04:35,040 --> 00:04:39,090
Just tell us what your favourite hand is

106
00:04:36,200 --> 00:04:38,960
Yes, the last one, then I'll be satisfied

107
00:04:39,090 --> 00:04:42,220
SUN VISOR!!

108
00:04:44,080 --> 00:04:45,480
What the hell was that

109
00:04:45,480 --> 00:04:49,960
A sun visor right?

Improvisation Liar's Inn
Maintain the lie all the way through!!

112
00:05:03,440 --> 00:05:07,040
Fully improvised! Liar's Inn

113
00:05:07,280 --> 00:05:15,080
A card is drawn at random. The person on the card must nominate someone else to tell either a  small, plausible, or massive lie.

114
00:05:15,320 --> 00:05:21,800
The nominated person must improvise everything and maintain the lie!

115
00:05:24,870 --> 00:05:27,170
Hamada nominates someone to tell a plausible lie

116
00:05:27,480 --> 00:05:29,960
Hamada-san, plausible,

117
00:05:29,960 --> 00:05:34,680
Tanaka I've heard this about your family, your dad,

118
00:05:34,680 --> 00:05:39,520
He's a banana farmer in the Philippines right?

119
00:05:37,000 --> 00:05:39,840
Eh? A big farm?

120
00:05:39,840 --> 00:05:42,360
He runs a massive farm apparently

121
00:05:42,360 --> 00:05:44,720
I've known him since elementary school, no way

122
00:05:45,000 --> 00:05:49,120
He controls some percentage of Japan's banana imports

123
00:05:49,400 --> 00:05:55,280
Ah, you heard about that? Yeah, this is really just uh,

124
00:05:55,280 --> 00:05:58,320
It was meant to be a secret, who did you hear this from?

125
00:05:58,320 --> 00:06:03,600
When I was eating a banana, someone said to me "Is that a Tanaka?"

126
00:06:05,880 --> 00:06:09,280
Maybe we've eaten a lot of Tanaka Bananas without knowing it

127
00:06:09,280 --> 00:06:11,720
Where were you born Tanaka?

128
00:06:10,720 --> 00:06:13,660
In the Philippines

129
00:06:12,160 --> 00:06:14,560
Eh? No way!

130
00:06:14,560 --> 00:06:17,440
You grew up in Osaka

131
00:06:17,440 --> 00:06:21,320
No no, I did live in Osaka, I did live there of course

132
00:06:21,440 --> 00:06:23,800
What about your Citizen Card?

133
00:06:23,800 --> 00:06:26,260
Yes, it says Manila

134
00:06:25,360 --> 00:06:27,120
Your place of origin?

135
00:06:27,120 --> 00:06:29,000
My origin yes

136
00:06:28,200 --> 00:06:32,600
If you go to a store, can you tell right away which bananas are yours?

137
00:06:31,040 --> 00:06:32,840
I can tell (x2)

138
00:06:32,840 --> 00:06:35,960
How can you tell?

139
00:06:34,000 --> 00:06:36,040
Um, you know,

140
00:06:36,040 --> 00:06:39,560
The straight bananas are our bananas

141
00:06:38,360 --> 00:06:40,320
Those exist?

142
00:06:40,320 --> 00:06:42,520
Our bananas are completely straight

143
00:06:40,840 --> 00:06:42,320
Gross!

144
00:06:42,800 --> 00:06:48,000
Oh, but I might have eaten one before
I remember thinking "Damn this is one straight banana"

145
00:06:48,000 --> 00:06:53,480
Thai bananas are curved like crescent moons right? Ours are straight

146
00:06:53,480 --> 00:06:54,680
Straight...?

147
00:06:54,680 --> 00:06:57,000
Like, almost completely straight

148
00:06:55,760 --> 00:06:57,320
Almost completely straight

149
00:06:57,320 --> 00:06:59,560
Ahhh, like those ones

150
00:06:57,400 --> 00:07:00,200
Right now, in like convenience stores and stuff,

151
00:07:00,200 --> 00:07:06,120
You can buy those single bananas, those are ours.
Those are from Tanaka Farm

152
00:07:06,120 --> 00:07:07,200
Tanaka Farm?

153
00:07:07,200 --> 00:07:09,680
They're Tanaka Farm Bananas

154
00:07:09,680 --> 00:07:11,240
What the brand name?

155
00:07:11,240 --> 00:07:13,680
It's TanaFarm

156
00:07:12,280 --> 00:07:13,400
TanaFarm?

157
00:07:13,840 --> 00:07:15,760
TN: Couldn't hear this part

158
00:07:17,600 --> 00:07:23,120
But you know, I never got the impression Tanaka knows about bananas

159
00:07:22,080 --> 00:07:24,120
Oh really?

160
00:07:23,120 --> 00:07:28,680
So then, is there something that sets tasty bananas apart?

161
00:07:28,680 --> 00:07:32,470
Well, the thing about tasty bananas is ...
How can I explain this...

162
00:07:32,470 --> 00:07:38,240
They have to be completely straight of course, and also ...
It's just so amazing, the ...

163
00:07:38,240 --> 00:07:40,280
The vibe!!

164
00:07:40,280 --> 00:07:42,280
I can't understand a banana's vibe

165
00:07:42,960 --> 00:07:44,480
It's just awesome

166
00:07:44,480 --> 00:07:46,840
A bananas vibe...

167
00:07:46,840 --> 00:07:49,040
Could you explain that to us too?

168
00:07:49,240 --> 00:07:51,640
What was he even trying to say?

169
00:07:51,640 --> 00:07:54,240
Oh dear, this one

170
00:07:53,920 --> 00:07:59,790
Hamada nominates someone to tell a small lie

171
00:07:54,600 --> 00:07:56,360
HamaSho

172
00:07:56,360 --> 00:07:59,840
I have to nominate right? Ok

173
00:07:56,560 --> 00:07:59,440
Yes, a small lie

174
00:08:00,600 --> 00:08:03,660
I heard you got petite plastic surgery?

175
00:08:00,600 --> 00:08:03,660
TN: plastic surgery that doesn't use a scalpel

176
00:08:04,040 --> 00:08:05,920
Where?

177
00:08:05,920 --> 00:08:08,800
What did you say?

178
00:08:07,120 --> 00:08:09,240
I heard you got petite plastic surgery

179
00:08:09,240 --> 00:08:17,160
Ahh damn it man, you're my partner!
Would my partner really reveal this secret my agent is doing his best to hide?

180
00:08:18,480 --> 00:08:19,960
Oh, sorry sorry

181
00:08:19,960 --> 00:08:27,320
This whole time Okamoto and I have been meeting, it's been multiple weeks. I've been telling him to keep this covered up

182
00:08:20,750 --> 00:08:28,320
Okamoto - President of Yoshimoto

183
00:08:23,600 --> 00:08:25,600
Oh really?

184
00:08:27,440 --> 00:08:32,760
And talking to Okamoto on the phone is a pain right?

185
00:08:31,720 --> 00:08:38,100
Yeah, yeah there's a lot to talk about there. He has a really quite voice.

186
00:08:35,320 --> 00:08:37,560
Whispers, that guy whispers

187
00:08:38,840 --> 00:08:41,800
Sometimes all you can hear is him smoking the cigarette

188
00:08:40,680 --> 00:08:42,320
Yeah!

189
00:08:42,760 --> 00:08:44,680
Even though I'm talking

190
00:08:43,560 --> 00:08:46,320
Even though I'm talking

191
00:08:46,880 --> 00:08:49,200
So he whispers like,

192
00:08:48,280 --> 00:08:49,640
Yeah

193
00:08:49,640 --> 00:08:53,000
Is it alright to say this on TV?

194
00:08:53,280 --> 00:08:56,240
Honestly it's not that small a surgery

195
00:08:56,240 --> 00:08:59,640
My nose came off!!

196
00:08:58,360 --> 00:09:00,480
Nose came off?...

197
00:09:01,120 --> 00:09:04,640
Your nose came off? Like in an accident?

198
00:09:05,000 --> 00:09:07,840
Well, yeah, an accident I guess, or rather,

199
00:09:07,840 --> 00:09:09,940
What do you want from me?

200
00:09:10,080 --> 00:09:12,160
I want you to explain that surgery

201
00:09:12,160 --> 00:09:13,640
Please explain!

202
00:09:13,640 --> 00:09:17,200
No no, it just happens sometimes I hear

203
00:09:17,200 --> 00:09:22,640
So it's not plastic surgery then, they just put your nose back right?

204
00:09:19,000 --> 00:09:21,400
Yes yes, it's not plastic- Sorry?

205
00:09:22,840 --> 00:09:25,480
Well to put it simply, yes

206
00:09:25,480 --> 00:09:31,560
This is something that happens sometimes, and the doctor told me to be careful. He said these cases are on the rise.

207
00:09:31,560 --> 00:09:34,280
There's a chance it could happen to us?

208
00:09:32,520 --> 00:09:34,520
Yes yes yes

209
00:09:34,520 --> 00:09:38,320
There's *paran* type, like this way

210
00:09:38,320 --> 00:09:40,880
Oh mine was this way though, but some are like this

211
00:09:40,880 --> 00:09:43,200
It's possible for your nose to come off like that?

212
00:09:41,960 --> 00:09:44,320
And sometimes it can be like *paran*

213
00:09:45,320 --> 00:09:48,840
And when it's *paran* like this sometimes you eat it an-

214
00:09:50,000 --> 00:09:53,120
Even though I just found something!

215
00:09:53,480 --> 00:09:57,000
Even though I found something funny to say just now!

216
00:09:58,360 --> 00:10:00,360
Horrible right?

217
00:10:00,360 --> 00:10:02,720
The split nose styles

218
00:10:02,720 --> 00:10:06,520
This guy thought I was so funny he had to stop me

219
00:10:05,000 --> 00:10:09,520
No no, it's just you kept saying "paran"

220
00:10:09,600 --> 00:10:12,240
Hamada-san just came up twice

221
00:10:10,880 --> 00:10:13,240
Yeah

222
00:10:14,830 --> 00:10:20,030
Hamada-san nominates someone to tell a massive lie

223
00:10:16,560 --> 00:10:18,720
He's gotten every type of lie

224
00:10:17,560 --> 00:10:20,080
He's so good at this

225
00:10:20,080 --> 00:10:25,840
I've recently realised how big of a liar Endo really is

226
00:10:25,840 --> 00:10:28,120
I hate that kind of thing

227
00:10:28,120 --> 00:10:34,920
Endo, you know, you always tell us in the break room you can't use an iPhone, and you've never used a computer,

228
00:10:34,920 --> 00:10:41,800
You say that pretty often right? Like "I don't know what you guys are talking about"

229
00:10:42,200 --> 00:10:48,320
But really, you hacked into the Pentagon didn't you?

230
00:10:53,840 --> 00:10:55,960
..What?

231
00:10:56,440 --> 00:10:59,840
What do you mean?

232
00:10:58,520 --> 00:11:00,740
You're lying right?

233
00:10:59,840 --> 00:11:02,440
I really can't talk about this

234
00:11:02,680 --> 00:11:05,240
Is it so bad you have to,

235
00:11:05,240 --> 00:11:08,720
You have to hide yourself with your sleeve like this?

236
00:11:07,080 --> 00:11:08,720
Impossible

237
00:11:08,720 --> 00:11:11,800
Is it worth covering hiding like that

238
00:11:11,800 --> 00:11:13,680
Cause this is an incredible story

239
00:11:13,680 --> 00:11:16,760
We won't broadcast this, we won't

240
00:11:17,040 --> 00:11:18,600
We definitely can't

241
00:11:18,600 --> 00:11:24,000
Well, if you ask me if it's true or false, well it's true

242
00:11:24,000 --> 00:11:26,560
Eh? Then that means...

243
00:11:25,000 --> 00:11:26,680
Is it alright for us to hear this?

244
00:11:26,680 --> 00:11:33,560
Well, I talk to close friends every week about playing golf, and I was messaging them

245
00:11:33,560 --> 00:11:39,600
And when I received the group message, there was a character I'd never seen before in there

246
00:11:39,600 --> 00:11:46,920
And when I saw the recepients, there were names like Shimuzu-san etc.

247
00:11:46,920 --> 00:11:51,280
But in the middle there was one weird name I'd never seen before

248
00:11:51,280 --> 00:11:58,160
But well, I didn't know what that was, so I just replied
"Alright, let's play golf!"

249
00:11:58,160 --> 00:12:03,840
And when I got the reply, that's when the Pentagon thing...

250
00:12:03,840 --> 00:12:05,920
He skipped so much

251
00:12:06,240 --> 00:12:10,040
Like I really had no idea that thing um...

252
00:12:08,680 --> 00:12:10,080
Your a hacker, right?

253
00:12:10,080 --> 00:12:12,280
You didn't do it yourself?

254
00:12:12,280 --> 00:12:18,800
That's where it starts
So I got the reply, was it the Pentagon?...

255
00:12:18,800 --> 00:12:24,400
It was someone who had questions about the Pentagon

256
00:12:24,400 --> 00:12:28,120
It was a Japanese person. It was a Japanese person living in Hong Kong.

257
00:12:28,120 --> 00:12:30,480
So not the Pentagon then

258
00:12:29,440 --> 00:12:31,240
It wasn't the Pentagon

259
00:12:30,480 --> 00:12:32,200
Well, let's hear more

260
00:12:32,200 --> 00:12:34,600
So then, actually-

261
00:12:33,760 --> 00:12:35,960
Let's listen attentively!

262
00:12:34,720 --> 00:12:36,280
Yes please

263
00:12:36,280 --> 00:12:39,800
I really shouldn't be talking about this

264
00:12:38,000 --> 00:12:39,880
Let's shut our mouths

265
00:12:38,710 --> 00:12:43,040
Endo! I don't understand anything! You haven't explained anything yet.

266
00:12:40,360 --> 00:12:43,040
Yes, I don't understand either

267
00:12:43,040 --> 00:12:45,040
What did he want to know?

268
00:12:45,040 --> 00:12:49,680
So that old man in Hong Kong,

269
00:12:48,320 --> 00:12:50,100
First time hearing Old man

270
00:12:50,320 --> 00:12:57,360
It was something about America needing oil from the Arabs,

271
00:12:57,360 --> 00:13:05,800
But like how do I say,
Something like, "If we don't invent a new weapon, we won't be able to get that oil!"

272
00:13:05,800 --> 00:13:09,360
And then something that was basically like "Ah, that's true"

273
00:13:09,360 --> 00:13:11,640
Who the hell are you talking to?

274
00:13:11,970 --> 00:13:13,740
This is about hacking right?

275
00:13:14,080 --> 00:13:16,560
Who are you talking to? I have no idea at all

276
00:13:16,560 --> 00:13:22,400
Sorry, what we want to hear is how you hacked them using a computer, how did you do that?

277
00:13:22,400 --> 00:13:24,600
You're a hacker right?

278
00:13:23,040 --> 00:13:25,440
What does a hacker do?

279
00:13:25,440 --> 00:13:31,240
What is hacking? What do you press?
After you open the laptop. What's the first thing you do?

280
00:13:26,600 --> 00:13:28,480
After you open the laptop

281
00:13:31,360 --> 00:13:33,560
What do I press?

282
00:13:33,560 --> 00:13:35,560
Hacking

283
00:13:34,240 --> 00:13:36,160
You have that thing right

284
00:13:36,160 --> 00:13:38,520
Mouse

285
00:13:36,640 --> 00:13:38,680
The mouse

286
00:13:39,800 --> 00:13:42,880
Is it alright to say this?

287
00:13:43,280 --> 00:13:45,800
What do you do first?

288
00:13:44,400 --> 00:13:46,080
What do you use first?

289
00:13:46,080 --> 00:13:47,640
What I use?

290
00:13:46,820 --> 00:13:48,890
What OS do you use?

291
00:13:47,640 --> 00:13:50,140
OS? I use this thing called OS-1

292
00:13:51,040 --> 00:13:53,720
Don't say it like it's obvious

293
00:13:52,440 --> 00:13:54,360
That heatstroke drink

294
00:13:55,000 --> 00:13:57,040
It's for heatstrokes

295
00:13:56,040 --> 00:13:58,040
This is bad, this really is

296
00:13:58,040 --> 00:13:59,720
Well whatever, you turn it on and then?

297
00:13:59,720 --> 00:14:01,000
Tell us

298
00:14:00,200 --> 00:14:01,800
What do you do after?

299
00:14:01,360 --> 00:14:06,440
Well it's a laptop, so I lift the lid. And then *Windows startup*

300
00:14:05,480 --> 00:14:07,320
You went like that right?

301
00:14:09,040 --> 00:14:15,240
Yes, so then, I use the mouse like this

302
00:14:09,270 --> 00:14:10,910
Windows right?

303
00:14:13,720 --> 00:14:16,320
Where do you move it to?

304
00:14:16,320 --> 00:14:19,000
That, there's this empty thing right?

305
00:14:19,000 --> 00:14:21,280
Empty thing?

306
00:14:19,480 --> 00:14:24,890
Well first I go to Yahoo! actually

307
00:14:22,840 --> 00:14:24,600
You go to Yahoo first?

308
00:14:25,120 --> 00:14:29,560
I get it, I get it. I think I start with off with Yahoo! too.

309
00:14:29,560 --> 00:14:34,480
I feel that too. Like you can't go wrong with going to Yahoo! first

310
00:14:35,680 --> 00:14:40,600
So after going to Yahoo, well first I want to see what's going on in society

311
00:14:40,600 --> 00:14:43,280
Yahoo Japan right?

312
00:14:41,400 --> 00:14:43,320
Yahoo Japan

313
00:14:43,320 --> 00:14:46,080
Yahoo Japan? Society? Oh the news.

314
00:14:43,680 --> 00:14:46,920
The news, I go there once

315
00:14:46,280 --> 00:14:48,000
Chiebukuro

316
00:14:48,000 --> 00:14:54,040
Yes, there's also entertainment. And I look at everything there.

317
00:14:54,040 --> 00:14:56,720
Well that's fine, you're allowed to look at that

318
00:14:56,720 --> 00:14:58,960
The hacking

319
00:14:59,200 --> 00:15:00,800
How do you do it?

320
00:14:59,760 --> 00:15:03,080
On the Yahoo screen, there's like this search box right?

321
00:15:03,480 --> 00:15:07,960
So I type "hacking" in there, and then look it up

322
00:15:08,440 --> 00:15:12,120
You search for hacking on Yahoo?!

323
00:15:11,080 --> 00:15:12,280
You search for it?!

324
00:15:12,280 --> 00:15:14,920
You search up hacking?

325
00:15:13,090 --> 00:15:16,830
After this: Hamada's new project?!

326
00:15:13,320 --> 00:15:16,840
It's just gonna give you the definition of Hacking

327
00:15:17,120 --> 00:15:19,000
Here I go

328
00:15:20,330 --> 00:15:25,900
Matsumoto nominates someone to tell a massive lie

329
00:15:23,320 --> 00:15:25,440
Matsumoto san's massive

330
00:15:26,200 --> 00:15:31,200
I think this something that might make a big impact in the entertainment industry,

331
00:15:31,200 --> 00:15:35,040
Apparently, Yamasaki is a dog

332
00:15:39,520 --> 00:15:41,560
You used to be a dog right?

333
00:15:41,560 --> 00:15:45,240
It finally comes out huh...

334
00:15:46,520 --> 00:15:48,920
I don't understand what you mean

335
00:15:48,040 --> 00:15:49,960
You don't right? He's a dog

336
00:15:50,240 --> 00:15:52,760
But he's not a dog

337
00:15:53,000 --> 00:15:54,840
I was shocked when I learned

338
00:15:54,840 --> 00:15:57,120
Let's not tell lies like that

339
00:15:55,400 --> 00:15:57,280
Yes let's not

340
00:15:57,280 --> 00:16:01,520
Hamada-san thank you very much. Nothing makes me happier than hearing that

341
00:16:01,880 --> 00:16:04,000
What do you mean?

342
00:16:02,240 --> 00:16:05,200
It makes me so happy to hear you say "He's not a dog"

343
00:16:04,320 --> 00:16:06,880
But just look at him...

344
00:16:05,200 --> 00:16:09,520
I've heard he's a dog, I'm sure of it, I asked for confirmation so many times

345
00:16:09,840 --> 00:16:14,480
Yes, there's no mistake there. A dog is a dog.

346
00:16:14,480 --> 00:16:19,960
Dogs have really strong noses right?

347
00:16:19,960 --> 00:16:25,840
Ah yes, I'm smelling things all the time. Like for example right now,

348
00:16:25,840 --> 00:16:29,720
Like I can tell someone is eating an omelet right now

349
00:16:29,880 --> 00:16:31,960
Nobody here is eating an omelet

350
00:16:31,960 --> 00:16:34,720
Maybe somewhere faraway someone is eating

351
00:16:34,720 --> 00:16:38,320
Yes, yes, if someone is eating somewhere faraway

352
00:16:38,320 --> 00:16:40,480
What about Curry?

353
00:16:38,600 --> 00:16:41,440
I'm really good at picking up food smells

354
00:16:41,440 --> 00:16:43,820
Oh, you can smell it?

355
00:16:42,680 --> 00:16:44,680
Of course!

356
00:16:44,040 --> 00:16:45,960
Oh right of course

357
00:16:45,080 --> 00:16:47,000
It's amazing you can't tell he's a dog

358
00:16:47,000 --> 00:16:48,680
What about pooping?

359
00:16:48,680 --> 00:16:55,000
This is a slightly rude story, but usually I poop at night

360
00:16:55,440 --> 00:16:57,160
Like a dog?

361
00:16:56,240 --> 00:16:58,440
That's not really a rude story...

362
00:16:57,600 --> 00:17:00,760
It's not. Who cares what time you go.

363
00:17:01,480 --> 00:17:04,520
I do have to make sure the litterbox is there

364
00:17:04,520 --> 00:17:06,880
Who puts the litterbox there?

365
00:17:05,240 --> 00:17:07,280
Isn't that for cats?

366
00:17:07,800 --> 00:17:10,320
Isn't litter for cats?

367
00:17:09,040 --> 00:17:10,940
I have the litter put there for me

368
00:17:10,940 --> 00:17:13,840
Maybe my wife got it wrong, I don't know

369
00:17:12,760 --> 00:17:14,640
Oh your wife does it?

370
00:17:13,840 --> 00:17:16,640
Isn't that for cats?

371
00:17:16,640 --> 00:17:21,680
I always use the litterbox. Otherwise I have no idea what to do/

372
00:17:21,680 --> 00:17:25,120
Alright, excuse me, could you just tell us your dog name?

373
00:17:25,120 --> 00:17:28,360
My name is Tama (Ball)

374
00:17:28,360 --> 00:17:31,520
Isn't that also like a cat name?

375
00:17:30,360 --> 00:17:32,280
It does sound like a cat name

376
00:17:32,280 --> 00:17:34,040
It is

377
00:17:34,040 --> 00:17:37,080
It's Tama... Tamarino

378
00:17:37,720 --> 00:17:39,080
Tamarina

379
00:17:39,080 --> 00:17:41,040
Tamarina?

380
00:17:39,880 --> 00:17:42,160
It's Tamarina! Ah, I remembered

381
00:17:43,880 --> 00:17:45,840
It's Tamarina

382
00:17:44,840 --> 00:17:47,840
You forgot it?

383
00:17:47,840 --> 00:17:50,080
Tamarina?

384
00:17:49,120 --> 00:17:50,440
Tamarina

385
00:17:50,440 --> 00:17:52,200
You're kidding right?

386
00:17:52,200 --> 00:17:56,440
I just remembered, it was Tamarina. Tamarina. Yeah.

387
00:17:56,760 --> 00:17:59,200
Ok ok. Tamarina.

388
00:18:03,520 --> 00:18:08,920
Well I did it press it, I just couldn't stand it...
I couldn't Standarina

389
00:18:13,440 --> 00:18:15,280
Here I go

390
00:18:15,640 --> 00:18:19,440
Hosei nominates someone to tell a small lie

391
00:18:15,760 --> 00:18:17,280
Oh you got it

392
00:18:17,280 --> 00:18:19,160
It's a Hosei-Sho (Sho means small)

393
00:18:19,600 --> 00:18:21,720
It's a Hosei-Sho

394
00:18:20,520 --> 00:18:22,000
A Hosei-Sho

395
00:18:22,280 --> 00:18:25,280
I heard this recently I think,

396
00:18:25,280 --> 00:18:31,280
Hamada-san created a Punk Band, was that recently?

397
00:18:31,280 --> 00:18:32,680
Seriously?

398
00:18:33,240 --> 00:18:35,880
I think you better stop

399
00:18:36,000 --> 00:18:40,840
Well, actually I'm not doing it yet,
I'm still looking for members

400
00:18:40,840 --> 00:18:42,840
You haven't done anything yet?

401
00:18:41,640 --> 00:18:46,760
Nothing yet, still in progress. You know like those small places in Shimokitazawa

402
00:18:47,280 --> 00:18:49,200
In places like that, right now I'm...

403
00:18:49,200 --> 00:18:52,960
I'm always gluing posters to walls recruiting new members

404
00:18:52,960 --> 00:18:54,960
Gluing?

405
00:18:54,960 --> 00:18:58,220
Well otherwise they can get ripped off

406
00:18:57,440 --> 00:19:00,720
If Hamada-san puts up a poster so many people will come

407
00:19:00,720 --> 00:19:05,960
Yeah but it's good to find someone with experience,
I just really want to do it,

408
00:19:05,960 --> 00:19:08,240
Punk though right?

409
00:19:08,240 --> 00:19:11,820
I thought of other stuff but I just had to do Punk

410
00:19:10,680 --> 00:19:12,840
No way that's true

411
00:19:12,900 --> 00:19:17,770
What about the name, for your band, have you decided on one?

412
00:19:17,770 --> 00:19:20,480
Punk...

413
00:19:21,200 --> 00:19:23,220
Punk

414
00:19:23,960 --> 00:19:25,600
That's all it is

415
00:19:25,600 --> 00:19:28,400
It does leave an impression

416
00:19:26,360 --> 00:19:29,640
The Punk,
It's The Punk

417
00:19:28,400 --> 00:19:30,400
The Punk?

418
00:19:31,040 --> 00:19:32,320
The Punk

419
00:19:32,320 --> 00:19:34,080
So exactly what the name is

420
00:19:33,360 --> 00:19:35,000
Exactly

421
00:19:34,200 --> 00:19:37,680
Oh so exactly as advertised

422
00:19:37,680 --> 00:19:38,920
The Punk?

423
00:19:38,920 --> 00:19:41,320
Yes yes yes yes

424
00:19:41,320 --> 00:19:45,120
The band members have names too

425
00:19:42,730 --> 00:19:45,430
What do you call yourself?

426
00:19:43,880 --> 00:19:45,600
Me?

427
00:19:47,560 --> 00:19:50,300
Hama-Punk

428
00:19:51,560 --> 00:19:53,940
You know, you're like...

429
00:19:53,940 --> 00:19:57,070
Aren't you ripping off your son?

430
00:19:53,940 --> 00:20:00,160
TN: Hamada's son is in a band called the Okamatos, and his stage name is Hama Okamoto

431
00:19:57,280 --> 00:20:00,160
You're just copying your son

432
00:20:00,160 --> 00:20:01,720
That's the worst

433
00:20:01,720 --> 00:20:05,760
I couldn't come up with anything ... Hama-Punk

434
00:20:05,760 --> 00:20:07,600
Here I go

435
00:20:08,790 --> 00:20:11,560
Hosei nominates someone to tell a massive lie

436
00:20:08,840 --> 00:20:10,240
Yama-chan, massive!

437
00:20:10,240 --> 00:20:12,480
A massive one...

438
00:20:14,800 --> 00:20:19,120
This is something that made me feel sad for him when I heard it,

439
00:20:19,280 --> 00:20:25,570
When I heard Matsumoto-san is under Tutankhamun's curse,

440
00:20:25,570 --> 00:20:27,480
I didn't know how to react

441
00:20:26,100 --> 00:20:32,740
After this: Matsumoto is cursed!?

442
00:20:33,000 --> 00:20:41,440
When I heard Matsumoto-san is under Tutankhamun's curse,
I didn't know how to react

443
00:20:43,240 --> 00:20:46,960
Sorry I don't understand ... Tutankhamun's curse?

444
00:20:47,520 --> 00:20:53,200
It really is awful

445
00:20:53,600 --> 00:20:57,800
If I had to start my life over, if you asked what kind of life I'd want,

446
00:20:57,800 --> 00:21:02,000
I would say a life where I avoided Tutankhamun's curse

447
00:21:02,360 --> 00:21:05,200
Right now too?

448
00:21:02,640 --> 00:21:05,200
I've been under it this whole time

449
00:21:05,200 --> 00:21:07,200
All the time!

450
00:21:06,200 --> 00:21:08,360
When did it start?

451
00:21:07,200 --> 00:21:09,180
Ahhh, it's already been...

452
00:21:09,180 --> 00:21:12,160
I think summer of last year?

453
00:21:10,920 --> 00:21:12,920
So recent!

454
00:21:12,920 --> 00:21:15,120
That's why I'm still not used to it!

455
00:21:15,120 --> 00:21:19,120
If I was used to it then fine. But I'm not so it sucks.

456
00:21:19,120 --> 00:21:22,560
What do you mean by getting used to it?

457
00:21:20,560 --> 00:21:22,560
You'll feel better after that?

458
00:21:22,560 --> 00:21:28,680
I feel like you can get used to a curse. Especially since it hasn't even been a year yet

459
00:21:28,680 --> 00:21:31,360
I feel like I'm still not used to it

460
00:21:31,360 --> 00:21:37,760
What kind of curse is it? Is it painful to your body? What kind of effects does it have?

461
00:21:37,760 --> 00:21:43,440
To sum it up, there's so much eye mucus!

462
00:21:43,680 --> 00:21:46,640
There's so much eye mucus,

463
00:21:46,960 --> 00:21:49,780
BUT THAT'S BASICALLY IT!!

464
00:21:50,440 --> 00:21:52,600
It's just eye mucus?

465
00:21:52,960 --> 00:21:56,280
I DARE YOU GUYS TO SAY THAT'S IT!

466
00:21:56,280 --> 00:22:03,320
There's always so much goddamn eye mucus coming out,
There's no point in even mentioning the curse anymore

467
00:22:03,320 --> 00:22:06,200
I used to mention it, I have Tutankhamun's curse

468
00:22:06,200 --> 00:22:09,080
But I got so sick of saying it, it's tiring,

469
00:22:09,080 --> 00:22:12,760
And everyone asking "Why" is so tiring,

470
00:22:12,760 --> 00:22:19,200
So I've always got this goddamn eye mucus. In the morning I really can't open my eyes

471
00:22:19,200 --> 00:22:20,720
But there's none right now

472
00:22:20,720 --> 00:22:25,630
Yeah exactly I'm getting it treated by the doctor
With some nasty medicine

473
00:22:25,630 --> 00:22:28,340
Drinking some nasty red medicine

474
00:22:28,680 --> 00:22:31,260
You can cure Tutankhamun's curse?

475
00:22:30,360 --> 00:22:32,440
You can cure it with medicine!

476
00:22:32,440 --> 00:22:35,040
That's good then, the curse-

477
00:22:34,160 --> 00:22:36,080
But it's SO bad, like,

478
00:22:36,080 --> 00:22:37,920
There are side effects?

479
00:22:36,760 --> 00:22:38,760
The side effects are awful!

480
00:22:38,880 --> 00:22:40,080
Eh? Like what?

481
00:22:40,080 --> 00:22:43,080
Like it's just awful. Like just so bad, like,

482
00:22:43,080 --> 00:22:45,360
My nose mucus just won't stop coming!

483
00:22:45,360 --> 00:22:50,160
That's it!?
It's either eye mucus or nose mucus

484
00:22:46,920 --> 00:22:49,240
So you have to choose between one?

485
00:22:50,520 --> 00:22:52,820
That sounds horrible

486
00:22:51,800 --> 00:22:57,360
Basically all I can do right now is either stop the eye mucus or the nose mucus

487
00:22:57,360 --> 00:23:01,120
Well in that case, isn't the eye mucus better?

488
00:23:01,120 --> 00:23:07,080
That's what the doctor told me
"Matsumoto-san, you have to choose one"

489
00:23:07,080 --> 00:23:09,360
Have you had those side effects this whole time?

490
00:23:09,360 --> 00:23:14,280
There must be a way to get rid of the curse I think

491
00:23:14,280 --> 00:23:17,840
Yeah, since it's a curse. You don't know how?

492
00:23:17,840 --> 00:23:19,900
You don't how to get rid of it?

493
00:23:18,800 --> 00:23:20,410
Ahh, I know how

494
00:23:20,410 --> 00:23:21,920
You have to drink oil

495
00:23:22,290 --> 00:23:25,720
Really hot oil

496
00:23:25,720 --> 00:23:29,720
I couldn't do that

497
00:23:29,920 --> 00:23:32,060
That sounds pretty awful

498
00:23:32,060 --> 00:23:35,160
Yeah that's impossible then

499
00:23:33,400 --> 00:23:35,720
You could die

500
00:23:35,720 --> 00:23:39,240
You have to drink really hot safflower oil

501
00:23:39,240 --> 00:23:41,840
It's incredible

502
00:23:40,920 --> 00:23:42,760
You could die

503
00:23:42,760 --> 00:23:45,320
I think your uvula would shrink right up

504
00:23:45,320 --> 00:23:47,520
That's a serious thing

505
00:23:47,520 --> 00:23:49,960
You can't get used to that right?

506
00:23:48,520 --> 00:23:50,680
You can't you can't, I won't drink it

507
00:23:50,680 --> 00:23:53,160
That's a really awful cure

508
00:23:53,160 --> 00:23:58,720
But really, Tutankhamun's curse really is scary

509
00:23:59,360 --> 00:24:01,960
I just wanted to say that again

510
00:24:03,690 --> 00:24:13,040
