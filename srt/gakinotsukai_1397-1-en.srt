He's too tall

28
00:00:54,960 --> 00:00:56,710
It's making things worse

29
00:00:57,260 --> 00:00:58,300

Really?

77
00:03:01,660 --> 00:03:03,330

He's not coming back

81
00:03:07,500 --> 00:03:08,940
It stinks!

82
00:03:08,940 --> 00:03:11,470
Is this the return of Hentai Kamen?

83
00:03:10,270 --> 00:03:14,740

Enough with the unknown stuff...

127
00:04:21,110 --> 00:04:26,020
Instead of water, the humidifier has been filled with tabasco

128
00:04:21,580 --> 00:04:22,880
I hate stuff like this

129
00:04:22,880 --> 00:04:25,080

Eh? What now? I'm scared

132
00:04:28,720 --> 00:04:30,680
You gotta get closer

133
00:04:29,090 --> 00:04:30,680
Do we have to get him closer?

134
00:04:30,680 --> 00:04:31,880
Forward

135
00:04:30,680 --> 00:04:31,880

00:04:35,880 --> 00:04:37,560
Like this, yes

139
00:04:36,360 --> 00:04:37,560
Really?

140
00:04:37,560 --> 00:04:38,800
Let's turn it on

141
00:04:38,830 --> 00:04:40,340

147
00:05:09,300 --> 00:05:11,630
That was incredible

148
00:05:13,260 --> 00:05:14,810
Unprecedented

149
00:05:16,320 --> 00:05:18,110

Why is he choosing for us? Geez...

159
00:05:32,740 --> 00:05:35,050

I don't want to!

165
00:05:40,690 --> 00:05:42,660
Come on, man...

166
00:05:42,660 --> 00:05:44,890
It wasn't on purpose, I swear

167
00:05:43,340 --> 00:05:45,490
His luck is really something

168
00:05:44,890 --> 00:05:47,900
His pull rate is incredible

169
00:05:45,490 --> 00:05:47,900
I can't help it

170
00:05:48,040 --> 00:05:49,160
Your turn now

171
00:05:49,370 --> 00:05:51,240

180
00:05:53,360 --> 00:05:54,720
Oh no...

181
00:05:53,360 --> 00:05:55,660
You share the same height

182
00:05:54,720 --> 00:05:55,660
You're right

183
00:05:55,660 --> 00:05:57,240
I can't do this

184
00:05:55,660 --> 00:05:57,240
It's fine, it's fine

185
00:05:57,240 --> 00:05:58,620
We can't do much about it

186
00:05:58,620 --> 00:06:00,140
What's this?

187
00:05:59,040 --> 00:06:00,140
Move forward

188
00:06:00,140 --> 00:06:01,910
In front of the desk

189
00:06:03,050 --> 00:06:04,700

193
00:06:07,680 --> 00:06:10,590
Oh boy, this looks freaky

194
00:06:09,360 --> 00:06:10,590
See? Same height

195
00:06:10,620 --> 00:06:12,440
Right

196
00:06:10,620 --> 00:06:12,440
What a coincidence

197
00:06:12,440 --> 00:06:14,460
It's dangerous if you move too much

198
00:06:14,460 --> 00:06:18,090
It's liquid nitrogen

199
00:06:15,500 --> 00:06:18,090
Ugh... watch out please

200
00:06:20,880 --> 00:06:25,270
You're right, their height is just fine

201
00:06:24,280 --> 00:06:27,280
I told you so

202
00:06:27,460 --> 00:06:29,040
Now you see it too

203
00:06:27,460 --> 00:06:29,040
You were right

204
00:06:29,040 --> 00:06:31,570
I'm way shorter than both of them

205
00:06:31,740 --> 00:06:33,810
It would have been awkward to film

206
00:06:32,580 --> 00:06:33,810
Yeah, right

207
00:06:35,220 --> 00:06:37,040
Oh...

208
00:06:35,220 --> 00:06:37,040
What now?

209
00:06:37,780 --> 00:06:39,500
What is he doi--- whoa, scary!

210
00:06:39,750 --> 00:06:41,700
Ugh, that's scary

211
00:06:40,440 --> 00:06:41,700
This is freaky

212
00:06:41,700 --> 00:06:42,950
Eh? What is---?

213
00:06:47,240 --> 00:06:48,720
This is really scary...

214
00:06:49,280 --> 00:06:50,530
What's this for?

215
00:06:50,530 --> 00:06:52,130
It's gonna explode

216
00:06:50,630 --> 00:06:52,130
For real?

217
00:06:52,130 --> 00:06:53,930
I don't know when

218
00:06:55,400 --> 00:06:57,060
What now?

219
00:06:55,900 --> 00:06:57,060
Huh? Again?

220
00:06:57,060 --> 00:06:58,370
Oh, I get it

221
00:07:00,580 --> 00:07:02,440
They're gonna hold it?

222
00:07:02,970 --> 00:07:04,340
Don't move around too much

223
00:07:04,340 --> 00:07:04,840
I won't

224
00:07:04,840 --> 00:07:05,680
I won't

225
00:07:05,680 --> 00:07:07,140
I won't

226
00:07:09,260 --> 00:07:11,980
I have no idea why he's doing this all over again

227
00:07:12,920 --> 00:07:14,370
It's about time

228
00:07:14,400 --> 00:07:15,640
What's his deal?

229
00:07:15,790 --> 00:07:18,890
I think it's almost done

230
00:07:16,260 --> 00:07:18,890
I don't like this

231
00:07:19,140 --> 00:07:21,500
Looks dangerous

232
00:07:20,140 --> 00:07:21,500
It is

233
00:07:21,930 --> 00:07:23,200
Can I say it?

234
00:07:23,200 --> 00:07:24,560
Alright, here we go

235
00:07:24,560 --> 00:07:25,680
3... 2... 1... Go!

236
00:07:25,680 --> 00:07:26,680
3... 2... 1... Go!

237
00:07:26,680 --> 00:07:27,480
3... 2... 1... Go!

238
00:07:27,480 --> 00:07:28,610
3... 2... 1... Go!

239
00:07:35,720 --> 00:07:37,240
W--wait!

240
00:07:37,600 --> 00:07:38,680
Wha--

241
00:07:41,460 --> 00:07:43,080
Scary scary scary

242
00:07:43,160 --> 00:07:44,820
This is scary

243
00:07:46,040 --> 00:07:47,400
What is...?

244
00:07:47,400 --> 00:07:48,200
Huh?

245
00:07:48,400 --> 00:07:49,360
What?

246
00:07:49,440 --> 00:07:50,990
Eh?

247
00:07:49,820 --> 00:07:50,990
Huh?

248
00:07:53,720 --> 00:07:55,590
It's not bursting at all

249
00:07:54,720 --> 00:07:55,590
Huh?

250
00:07:55,920 --> 00:07:57,590
Is this normal?

251
00:07:57,920 --> 00:07:59,060
What?

252
00:08:00,840 --> 00:08:02,700
What are they doing?

253
00:08:01,770 --> 00:08:02,700
Huh?

254
00:08:04,140 --> 00:08:05,020
What?

255
00:08:06,000 --> 00:08:08,360
Nothing's happening, what's going on?

256
00:08:11,910 --> 00:08:13,940
Is this a failed experiment?

257
00:08:12,440 --> 00:08:13,940
Huh?

258
00:08:18,060 --> 00:08:19,220
It's not exploding

259
00:08:21,660 --> 00:08:23,210
Holy crap

260
00:08:24,880 --> 00:08:26,960
It went to their lower back

261
00:08:27,260 --> 00:08:29,090
It took forever

262
00:08:29,090 --> 00:08:32,480
It took so long for it to burst

263
00:08:32,480 --> 00:08:34,500
For a moment I thought it wasn't planned

264
00:08:33,480 --> 00:08:34,500
Me too

265
00:08:34,720 --> 00:08:35,800
How was it?

266
00:08:34,720 --> 00:08:35,800
Is your back fine?

267
00:08:35,800 --> 00:08:39,200
I fell on my butt

268
00:08:36,440 --> 00:08:37,580
You did?

269
00:08:37,580 --> 00:08:38,880
He fell on his butt

270
00:08:38,880 --> 00:08:41,640
That much?

271
00:08:38,880 --> 00:08:41,640
They both flew away

272
00:08:42,020 --> 00:08:44,600
What exactly happened?

273
00:08:44,600 --> 00:08:46,200
It's the liquid nitrogen

274
00:08:45,410 --> 00:08:52,680
The cooled-down, shrunken air inside the balloon was warmed
up by the liquid nitrogen, which made it expand and explode

275
00:08:47,860 --> 00:08:52,680
For a second I thought "let's just do this again from scratch"

276
00:08:50,200 --> 00:08:52,680
Yeah, I thought that too

277
00:08:55,420 --> 00:08:57,080
There's still more

278
00:08:57,080 --> 00:08:59,260
This is never going to end

279
00:08:57,960 --> 00:08:59,260
Really

280
00:08:58,520 --> 00:09:00,860
Whole body electric machine

281
00:08:59,260 --> 00:09:01,610
Oh no

282
00:08:59,600 --> 00:09:01,610
Enough with all of this...

283
00:09:01,190 --> 00:09:05,430
Whole body electric machine

284
00:09:01,190 --> 00:09:05,430
topic

285
00:09:01,610 --> 00:09:03,620
I don't like this one

286
00:09:02,000 --> 00:09:03,620
Seriously Hakamada, you do it

287
00:09:03,620 --> 00:09:05,430
Please, draw the skull

288
00:09:05,730 --> 00:09:08,230
What the hell did ya come here for!?

289
00:09:11,840 --> 00:09:14,430
You can pick your card first, you didn't do it before

290
00:09:12,840 --> 00:09:14,430
Pick it and flip it

291
00:09:14,860 --> 00:09:16,640
Just flip it already

292
00:09:16,640 --> 00:09:19,940
Hakamada

293
00:09:16,640 --> 00:09:19,940
Tanaka

294
00:09:16,740 --> 00:09:17,900
Ready?

295
00:09:16,940 --> 00:09:17,900
Flip them

296
00:09:18,220 --> 00:09:19,610
You gotta be kidding me

297
00:09:20,110 --> 00:09:23,380
Tanaka & Hakamada

298
00:09:21,840 --> 00:09:23,380
Really?!

299
00:09:24,700 --> 00:09:26,420
Ready? One, two...

306
00:09:29,050 --> 00:09:34,290
Whole body electric machine

307
00:09:29,340 --> 00:09:30,990
Yes yes yes

308
00:09:31,200 --> 00:09:32,440
YES, YES, YES

309
00:09:32,440 --> 00:09:34,290
Electroshock again...

310
00:09:32,660 --> 00:09:34,290
Do I have to do this?

311
00:09:34,960 --> 00:09:37,090
Don't shout too much

312
00:09:35,330 --> 00:09:37,090
It's an electric machine

313
00:09:37,760 --> 00:09:42,970

Hamada

330
00:09:57,880 --> 00:10:00,720
Whole body electric machine

331
00:10:02,440 --> 00:10:04,080
Whoa, what's that?!

332
00:10:04,080 --> 00:10:07,060
This looks terrifying

333
00:10:05,340 --> 00:10:07,060
This is so scary

334
00:10:08,540 --> 00:10:11,620
Don't hit him

335
00:10:09,390 --> 00:10:11,620
Violence is no good

336
00:10:11,620 --> 00:10:14,200
Don't use violence, sorry

337
00:10:15,320 --> 00:10:18,820
Are you kidding me? What's this?

338
00:10:16,160 --> 00:10:18,820
These guys are doing their jobs

339
00:10:20,320 --> 00:10:21,560
Looks bad...

340
00:10:22,740 --> 00:10:25,890
Eh? What are you supposed to do with that?

341
00:10:24,260 --> 00:10:25,890
He's talking so normally

342
00:10:26,060 --> 00:10:27,010
Huh?

343
00:10:27,120 --> 00:10:29,220
I'm freaking out, man

344
00:10:27,120 --> 00:10:29,220
Keep quiet please

345
00:10:29,220 --> 00:10:30,800
Don't raise your voice

346
00:10:29,220 --> 00:10:30,800
We're in a library

347
00:10:30,800 --> 00:10:31,380
Eh?!

348
00:10:31,380 --> 00:10:33,380
Don't shout please

349
00:10:33,720 --> 00:10:39,960
5 electric machines are placed on him

350
00:10:34,620 --> 00:10:37,940
They're putting so much stuff on him...

351
00:10:35,660 --> 00:10:37,940
I really hate this

352
00:10:39,380 --> 00:10:40,940
The hell are you doin'?

353
00:10:41,240 --> 00:10:42,820
Well, it's for the whole body

354
00:10:42,820 --> 00:10:44,890
It's full-body, you know

355
00:10:42,820 --> 00:10:44,890
There's a lot of things to put on

356
00:10:44,890 --> 00:10:46,600
Did you place one on my butt?

357
00:10:46,600 --> 00:10:48,030
It's full-body after all

358
00:10:46,600 --> 00:10:48,400
There's still more

359
00:10:48,030 --> 00:10:49,700
Just let them do it

360
00:10:48,780 --> 00:10:49,700
What?

361
00:10:49,700 --> 00:10:50,380
My neck?

362
00:10:50,380 --> 00:10:53,860
Of course, your entire body

363
00:10:51,660 --> 00:10:53,860
Maybe it's better to have one there

364
00:10:53,860 --> 00:10:55,200
How can it be?!

365
00:10:55,360 --> 00:10:58,260
So it won't be tense, you know

366
00:10:58,580 --> 00:10:59,780
Are you kidding me?

367
00:10:59,780 --> 00:11:00,640
What the--?

368
00:11:00,640 --> 00:11:01,480
Not done yet

369
00:11:01,480 --> 00:11:03,880
It's their job, treat them well

370
00:11:03,880 --> 00:11:04,900
Huh? My stomach?

371
00:11:04,900 --> 00:11:06,600
Is it ok to do it on my stomach?

372
00:11:06,840 --> 00:11:08,280
Now you're all set

373
00:11:08,280 --> 00:11:11,120
The entire body

374
00:11:08,500 --> 00:11:11,120
Are you really making me do this?

375
00:11:11,720 --> 00:11:13,110
Shut up

376
00:11:14,020 --> 00:11:15,720
It's not on yet

377
00:11:14,020 --> 00:11:16,200
I mean-- wait a sec

378
00:11:15,720 --> 00:11:18,720
Matsumoto, press the button on the count of 3

379
00:11:16,200 --> 00:11:18,720
You gotta press that

380
00:11:18,720 --> 00:11:21,160
I'm not joking, this is not ok

381
00:11:21,380 --> 00:11:23,260
I have no idea how it's gonna be

382
00:11:23,260 --> 00:11:24,740
Make it weak, ok?!

383
00:11:23,260 --> 00:11:24,740
Three...

384
00:11:24,740 --> 00:11:27,260
Two...

385
00:11:25,380 --> 00:11:27,260
Really, set it to weak

386
00:11:27,260 --> 00:11:28,420
Three...

387
00:11:28,420 --> 00:11:31,270
Does it have an option for it?

388
00:11:29,560 --> 00:11:31,270
Two...

389
00:11:31,560 --> 00:11:32,780
It doesn't

390
00:11:31,560 --> 00:11:32,780
That thing...

391
00:11:32,780 --> 00:11:34,680
There's only this one

392
00:11:33,100 --> 00:11:34,680
Oh? Only one?

393
00:11:34,680 --> 00:11:38,030
That's weird, it should have that setting

394
00:11:38,760 --> 00:11:40,430
Set it to weak, pleas--

395
00:11:39,920 --> 00:11:56,670
Electricity

396
00:11:46,460 --> 00:11:48,620
This looks freaky

397
00:11:47,140 --> 00:11:48,620
It hurts so bad!

398
00:11:48,620 --> 00:11:50,460
Ouch

399
00:11:54,360 --> 00:11:56,670
Scary scary scary scary

400
00:11:56,670 --> 00:11:59,280
Switch it off, it's still going

401
00:11:57,140 --> 00:11:59,040
Is it?

402
00:11:59,040 --> 00:12:00,200
See?

403
00:11:59,280 --> 00:12:00,200
Stop pressing it!

404
00:12:00,200 --> 00:12:01,500
I'm not pressing it

405
00:12:00,800 --> 00:12:02,250
Whaat?!

406
00:12:02,040 --> 00:12:20,990
Electricity

407
00:12:03,300 --> 00:12:04,340
Oh man

408
00:12:04,800 --> 00:12:06,500
He's in pain

409
00:12:06,920 --> 00:12:07,820
Please

410
00:12:07,400 --> 00:12:09,160
What's going on?

411
00:12:07,820 --> 00:12:09,160
I can't I can't I can't

412
00:12:09,160 --> 00:12:11,210
It hurts so bad

413
00:12:14,200 --> 00:12:15,260
%$&

414
00:12:15,740 --> 00:12:17,620
@#%!&△〇

415
00:12:21,760 --> 00:12:23,690
I would hate this so much

416
00:12:23,730 --> 00:12:25,560
It's the worst

417
00:12:24,200 --> 00:12:25,560
Yeah, it sucks

418
00:12:25,560 --> 00:12:28,260
Enough with that

419
00:12:25,960 --> 00:12:28,260
No more electric machines, please

420
00:12:28,260 --> 00:12:30,330
Holy shit...

421
00:12:28,260 --> 00:12:30,330
It's finally over

422
00:12:31,640 --> 00:12:32,900
Don't hurt him

423
00:12:32,900 --> 00:12:36,410
Just stop, it's fine

424
00:12:36,410 --> 00:12:37,360
Tanaka?

425
00:12:36,410 --> 00:12:37,360
Who---

426
00:12:37,360 --> 00:12:39,410
Who got the least punishments?

427
00:12:37,720 --> 00:12:39,410
What's next?

428
00:12:39,440 --> 00:12:44,950
Endo  2 times

429
00:12:39,440 --> 00:12:44,950
Tanaka  4 times

430
00:12:39,540 --> 00:12:40,600
I got it twice

431
00:12:39,640 --> 00:12:44,950
Hakamada  4 times

432
00:12:39,640 --> 00:12:44,950
Matsumoto  2 times

433
00:12:39,810 --> 00:12:44,950
Hamada  2 times

434
00:12:39,810 --> 00:12:44,950
Hosei  2 times

435
00:12:40,600 --> 00:12:42,320
Me too

436
00:12:41,020 --> 00:12:42,320
Same here

437
00:12:42,320 --> 00:12:44,060
It's pretty balanced

438
00:12:43,080 --> 00:12:44,060
You too?

439
00:12:44,060 --> 00:12:45,390
We're all getting it today

440
00:12:44,700 --> 00:12:46,050
You sure?

441
00:12:45,390 --> 00:12:47,350
And now we're all talking like normal

442
00:12:47,350 --> 00:12:49,590
Shh, we're in a library

443
00:12:49,960 --> 00:12:51,690
We gotta keep quiet

444
00:12:53,280 --> 00:12:54,620
Let's move on

445
00:12:56,690 --> 00:12:59,900
Large-breed dog licking action

446
00:12:57,880 --> 00:12:59,320
Come on...

447
00:12:59,320 --> 00:13:02,300
What the hell...

448
00:13:00,230 --> 00:13:05,330
Large-breed dog licking action

449
00:13:00,230 --> 00:13:05,330
topic

450
00:13:00,620 --> 00:13:02,300
Isn't this enough?

451
00:13:05,460 --> 00:13:07,310
Please go first, Hamada

452
00:13:08,860 --> 00:13:10,910
Alright then, like this

453
00:13:13,740 --> 00:13:14,740
Ready?

454
00:13:13,740 --> 00:13:16,410
Endo

455
00:13:13,740 --> 00:13:16,410
Hakamada

456
00:13:13,740 --> 00:13:16,410
Hamada

Large-breed dog licking action

462
00:13:16,650 --> 00:13:20,320
Shh

463
00:13:18,000 --> 00:13:19,100
That's ok

464
00:13:19,380 --> 00:13:22,140
There's nothing we can do about it

465
00:13:20,940 --> 00:13:22,140
Senpai, please

466
00:13:22,140 --> 00:13:23,240
Senpai

467
00:13:22,540 --> 00:13:24,060
Thanks so much

468
00:13:23,240 --> 00:13:25,050
Thank you, senpai

469
00:13:24,060 --> 00:13:25,050
Thank you

470
00:13:25,050 --> 00:13:27,420
On your knees

471
00:13:25,440 --> 00:13:27,420
Kneel down, please

472
00:13:27,590 --> 00:13:29,220
This will be on your face

473
00:13:27,690 --> 00:13:32,200
Salted butter to smear on his face

474
00:13:29,220 --> 00:13:30,340
What are you doing?!

475
00:13:30,340 --> 00:13:32,200
It's just butter

476
00:13:30,980 --> 00:13:32,200
It's butter

477
00:13:32,200 --> 00:13:34,360
Come on, don't do this...

478
00:13:37,320 --> 00:13:38,900
The whole face

479
00:13:37,800 --> 00:13:41,670
It smells so good

480
00:13:39,300 --> 00:13:41,670
Who cares about the smell

481
00:13:44,000 --> 00:13:46,110
It smells really good

482
00:13:46,360 --> 00:13:48,500
Isn't this too much?

483
00:13:48,980 --> 00:13:50,850
You're looking cute

484
00:13:50,850 --> 00:13:52,080
So cute

485
00:13:50,850 --> 00:13:52,080
Very cute

486
00:13:52,080 --> 00:13:53,970
Cutie

487
00:13:52,440 --> 00:13:53,970
Lookin' good

488
00:13:56,290 --> 00:13:57,580
On the nose too

489
00:13:57,580 --> 00:13:59,940
All set

490
00:13:57,580 --> 00:13:59,940
Now he looks so good

491
00:13:59,940 --> 00:14:00,820
Ok

492
00:14:01,000 --> 00:14:02,370
We're done

493
00:14:02,880 --> 00:14:04,230
Here it comes

494
00:14:04,230 --> 00:14:05,400
Here it is

495
00:14:05,400 --> 00:14:07,600
Oh no... please no...

496
00:14:08,080 --> 00:14:09,700
It's so cute

497
00:14:08,320 --> 00:14:09,700
I'm scared

498
00:14:09,700 --> 00:14:11,500
Come on, it's cute

499
00:14:10,400 --> 00:14:11,500
It's so cute

500
00:14:11,500 --> 00:14:13,300
I'm sure it's hungry

501
00:14:12,180 --> 00:14:13,300
Cute!

502
00:14:14,180 --> 00:14:16,400
It's scared

503
00:14:15,000 --> 00:14:16,400
'Cause he's too yummy

504
00:14:16,400 --> 00:14:18,140
I'm the scared one here

505
00:14:18,140 --> 00:14:19,440
Too yummy...?

506
00:14:19,440 --> 00:14:20,500
I don't like this---

507
00:14:20,500 --> 00:14:22,660
Good boy, lick it all off

508
00:14:22,660 --> 00:14:24,500
Nice and clean, ok?

509
00:14:24,500 --> 00:14:26,080
Lick to your heart's content

510
00:14:26,480 --> 00:14:28,980
It's all gone already

511
00:14:27,020 --> 00:14:28,980
Lick some more

512
00:14:28,980 --> 00:14:30,800
That was very quick

513
00:14:30,800 --> 00:14:32,200
He's so clean now

514
00:14:31,220 --> 00:14:32,200
Incredible

515
00:14:32,200 --> 00:14:34,280
Can't believe it

516
00:14:33,440 --> 00:14:34,280
Right

517
00:14:34,280 --> 00:14:36,160
Clean in a blink of an eye

518
00:14:35,340 --> 00:14:37,320
Look at its tail

519
00:14:36,160 --> 00:14:38,620
It's happy

520
00:14:38,620 --> 00:14:40,200
Look at him

521
00:14:39,120 --> 00:14:40,200
Completely

522
00:14:40,230 --> 00:14:42,580
All cleaned up

523
00:14:40,840 --> 00:14:42,580
It's taking its time

524
00:14:42,580 --> 00:14:44,200
And it's still going on

525
00:14:42,760 --> 00:14:44,200
He's all clean

526
00:14:44,200 --> 00:14:45,670
It's so interested in him

527
00:14:45,980 --> 00:14:49,200
It's wiggling its tail so much

528
00:14:46,640 --> 00:14:49,200
It's so happy

529
00:14:49,200 --> 00:14:51,100
And it's done, nice huh?

530
00:14:49,200 --> 00:14:51,100
Just look at it

531
00:14:51,100 --> 00:14:52,510
It's going for the butter

532
00:14:52,510 --> 00:14:55,540
It wants more of it

533
00:14:52,510 --> 00:14:55,540
Let's put it aside

534
00:14:55,540 --> 00:14:56,680
It's there

535
00:14:57,030 --> 00:14:58,510
C'mere boy

536
00:14:59,280 --> 00:15:02,520
It cleaned me up

537
00:14:59,840 --> 00:15:02,520
Yeah, isn't that good?

538
00:15:02,520 --> 00:15:04,320
I better not lick it myself

539
00:15:03,120 --> 00:15:04,320
Yeah

540
00:15:04,320 --> 00:15:05,460
That wasn't bad

541
00:15:05,460 --> 00:15:08,280
Yeah, you're right

542
00:15:06,400 --> 00:15:08,280
It was cute

543
00:15:08,280 --> 00:15:09,660
It's just a nice dog

544
00:15:09,660 --> 00:15:11,930
I wouldn't have minded it

545
00:15:12,340 --> 00:15:14,620
Man I'm tired

546
00:15:12,340 --> 00:15:16,240
We've done so much today, can't we just stop?

547
00:15:14,620 --> 00:15:16,240
Hang in there

548
00:15:16,240 --> 00:15:17,980
We even got to feed a dog

549
00:15:17,980 --> 00:15:22,340
A lot of variation in this episode

550
00:15:19,000 --> 00:15:22,340
Way too much, I'd say

551
00:15:22,340 --> 00:15:23,840
Let's see the next one

552
00:15:25,040 --> 00:15:28,610
Nail drop on palm

553
00:15:26,180 --> 00:15:27,160
Wha-?

554
00:15:27,740 --> 00:15:30,070
What is this?

555
00:15:27,740 --> 00:15:30,070
What's this now?

556
00:15:28,950 --> 00:15:36,550
Nail drop on palm

557
00:15:28,950 --> 00:15:36,550
topic

558
00:15:30,300 --> 00:15:31,860
So irritating...

559
00:15:32,020 --> 00:15:34,380
There are too many new things today

560
00:15:34,380 --> 00:15:36,920
Wow

561
00:15:34,840 --> 00:15:36,920
Why are we doing this?

562
00:15:36,550 --> 00:15:39,690
Endo

563
00:15:36,550 --> 00:15:39,690
Hakamada

564
00:15:36,550 --> 00:15:39,690
Hamada

565
00:15:36,550 --> 00:15:39,690
Hosei

566
00:15:36,550 --> 00:15:39,690
Matsumoto

567
00:15:36,550 --> 00:15:39,690
Tanaka

568
00:15:36,920 --> 00:15:37,920
Ready and...

569
00:15:38,540 --> 00:15:39,690
No way

570
00:15:39,920 --> 00:15:40,840
What?!

571
00:15:39,920 --> 00:15:45,090
Hamada

572
00:15:39,920 --> 00:15:45,090
Nail drop on palm

573
00:15:39,920 --> 00:15:45,090
Shh

574
00:15:40,840 --> 00:15:41,990
Thank you, God

575
00:15:42,140 --> 00:15:45,090
This is proof that God exists, thank you

576
00:15:45,880 --> 00:15:48,090
Please, Hamada, go over there

577
00:15:48,720 --> 00:15:52,820
It's him again, I'm scared of him

578
00:15:49,800 --> 00:15:52,820
By the time you see this guy, you know it's about science

579
00:15:52,820 --> 00:15:53,900
Am I right?

580
00:15:52,820 --> 00:15:53,900
That's right

581
00:15:53,900 --> 00:16:00,810
A terrifying punishment!

582
00:15:54,340 --> 00:15:55,540
One...

583
00:16:00,810 --> 00:16:03,650
Hamada

584
00:16:00,810 --> 00:16:03,650
Nail drop on palm

585
00:16:03,650 --> 00:16:04,910
Like that? Really?

586
00:16:05,040 --> 00:16:06,480
Like this?

587
00:16:07,100 --> 00:16:09,050
This is seriously scary

588
00:16:07,820 --> 00:16:09,050
Don't move an inch

589
00:16:09,090 --> 00:16:09,890
What?!

590
00:16:10,000 --> 00:16:13,000
Really, if you move here they're gonna stab you

591
00:16:10,620 --> 00:16:11,720
Don't do it

592
00:16:11,720 --> 00:16:13,000
Don't move

593
00:16:13,300 --> 00:16:14,940
I'm freaking out so much

594
00:16:15,340 --> 00:16:17,180
Those things are huge

595
00:16:17,800 --> 00:16:18,920
What are those nails?!

596
00:16:18,920 --> 00:16:20,200
Too long

597
00:16:18,920 --> 00:16:20,200
Wait---

598
00:16:20,200 --> 00:16:21,430
So long...

599
00:16:22,360 --> 00:16:24,170
I'm scared as hell

600
00:16:25,280 --> 00:16:26,500
Stay still, don't move

601
00:16:26,500 --> 00:16:28,790
We don't want you to get hurt

602
00:16:29,140 --> 00:16:30,970
Is it all ready now?

603
00:16:30,970 --> 00:16:32,600
Here we go, Hamada

604
00:16:31,320 --> 00:16:32,600
Don't move

605
00:16:32,600 --> 00:16:33,720
3... 2... 1...

606
00:16:33,720 --> 00:16:35,010
3... 2... 1...

607
00:16:35,010 --> 00:16:35,950
3... 2... 1...

608
00:16:46,340 --> 00:16:48,060
It grazed me a bit

609
00:16:48,320 --> 00:16:50,560
Holy shit!!

610
00:16:50,720 --> 00:16:52,630
He's right!

611
00:16:52,860 --> 00:16:55,260
It's almost in

612
00:16:52,860 --> 00:16:55,260
So close!

613
00:16:55,260 --> 00:16:58,630
Maybe you were shaking
so much you moved it a bit?

614
00:16:58,840 --> 00:17:00,370
This is so freaky

615
00:17:00,370 --> 00:17:01,980
It's getting dangerous

616
00:17:01,980 --> 00:17:04,370
This is too much

617
00:17:04,370 --> 00:17:05,570
It's dangerous

618
00:17:05,570 --> 00:17:07,340
Not a single scratch here, I'm fine

619
00:17:07,610 --> 00:17:10,980
It would've been better if there was blood so we could quit

620
00:17:11,260 --> 00:17:12,340
Geez...

621
00:17:12,560 --> 00:17:14,160
Seriously, I've had enough

622
00:17:12,860 --> 00:17:14,160
We're not done yet?

623
00:17:14,160 --> 00:17:14,980
Really, let's stop

624
00:17:14,980 --> 00:17:16,920
I want this to end

625
00:17:15,280 --> 00:17:16,920
Really, that's enough

626
00:17:17,780 --> 00:17:20,480
There's still more...

627
00:17:18,800 --> 00:17:20,480
Still more...?

628
00:17:20,220 --> 00:17:23,890
Bicycle run-over

629
00:17:21,360 --> 00:17:22,680
What now...

630
00:17:22,680 --> 00:17:23,890
What the-?

631
00:17:23,000 --> 00:17:23,890
"Bicycle"...?

632
00:17:24,080 --> 00:17:25,230
Enough...

633
00:17:24,230 --> 00:17:30,100
Bycicle run-over

634
00:17:24,230 --> 00:17:30,100
topic

635
00:17:25,230 --> 00:17:27,530
We're gonna die if we do that

636
00:17:27,530 --> 00:17:30,100
He's right

637
00:17:27,900 --> 00:17:30,100
Man, today's stuff is so bad

638
00:17:30,100 --> 00:17:32,130
Run over by a bicycle?

639
00:17:30,100 --> 00:17:32,130
What's the deal with this episode?

640
00:17:32,130 --> 00:17:35,670
It's too much

641
00:17:32,500 --> 00:17:35,670
The authors are gonna hear from me later

642
00:17:35,670 --> 00:17:37,710
This can't be good

643
00:17:36,220 --> 00:17:37,710
This isn't ok

644
00:17:38,780 --> 00:17:40,380
This time it'll work

645
00:17:40,900 --> 00:17:41,940
Oh my

646
00:17:41,940 --> 00:17:43,780
Let's get over this

647
00:17:43,780 --> 00:17:44,780
Ready? Two, one...

648
00:17:43,780 --> 00:17:47,220
Endo

649
00:17:43,780 --> 00:17:47,220
Hakamada

650
00:17:43,780 --> 00:17:47,220
Hamada

651
00:17:43,780 --> 00:17:47,220
Hosei

652
00:17:43,780 --> 00:17:47,220
Matsumoto

653
00:17:43,780 --> 00:17:47,220
Tanaka

654
00:17:46,540 --> 00:17:49,420
No way...

655
00:17:47,480 --> 00:17:53,820
Bicycle run-over

656
00:17:47,480 --> 00:17:53,820
Shh

657
00:17:47,480 --> 00:17:53,820
Tanaka

658
00:17:47,560 --> 00:17:49,420
Well, that's how it is

659
00:17:49,420 --> 00:17:53,820
He's perfect for this

660
00:17:50,660 --> 00:17:51,820
Am I?!

661
00:17:51,820 --> 00:17:53,820
Is he really...?

662
00:17:53,820 --> 00:17:55,140
For getting run over?

663
00:17:55,140 --> 00:17:57,260
He just snapped

664
00:17:57,720 --> 00:17:59,660
I'm not angry

665
00:18:04,600 --> 00:18:07,360
It's rare to see him punished at the end

666
00:18:05,540 --> 00:18:07,360
Whoa, I'm scared

667
00:18:07,360 --> 00:18:08,770
Ok, all set

668
00:18:10,510 --> 00:18:12,300
It's one of those, isn't it?

669
00:18:12,300 --> 00:18:13,800
This is gonna hurt

670
00:18:13,800 --> 00:18:15,200
Oh? From there?

671
00:18:15,200 --> 00:18:16,460
I know these

672
00:18:15,200 --> 00:18:16,460
Over here?

673
00:18:16,460 --> 00:18:18,000
This must be a joke

674
00:18:18,000 --> 00:18:19,200
This will hurt for sure

675
00:18:19,200 --> 00:18:21,660
Yeah I mean, he's getting run over

676
00:18:20,300 --> 00:18:21,660
Oh, here he comes

677
00:18:21,660 --> 00:18:22,850
Oh shit

678
00:18:24,200 --> 00:18:25,320
Oh my...

679
00:18:25,540 --> 00:18:26,760
Careful

680
00:18:27,220 --> 00:18:28,700
Can we rely on him?

681
00:18:28,960 --> 00:18:29,790
See?

682
00:18:29,790 --> 00:18:32,030
He's not at his best

683
00:18:32,030 --> 00:18:34,380
Today's not his day, Tanaka

684
00:18:32,720 --> 00:18:34,380
He's not in shape

685
00:18:34,380 --> 00:18:36,170
Brace yourself, he's coming

686
00:18:34,380 --> 00:18:36,170
Whoa, wait---

687
00:18:36,260 --> 00:18:37,850
He's not feeling good

688
00:18:38,480 --> 00:18:39,320
Wait-

689
00:18:39,620 --> 00:18:41,300
Wait a sec-

690
00:18:40,100 --> 00:18:41,300
Not yet I guess

691
00:18:42,020 --> 00:18:43,220
And now he's back

692
00:18:43,660 --> 00:18:44,820
This is so scary

693
00:18:45,670 --> 00:18:48,640
He knows he's gonna get run over

694
00:18:46,440 --> 00:18:48,640
Careful there

695
00:18:51,180 --> 00:18:54,260
Maybe he's going to stop?

696
00:18:52,120 --> 00:18:54,260
Like, first he charges him and then stops?

697
00:18:54,260 --> 00:18:55,260
Watch out!

698
00:18:56,220 --> 00:18:57,050
He ran him over!

699
00:18:57,050 --> 00:18:58,190
Watch out!

700
00:18:59,300 --> 00:19:00,260
He ran him over!

701
00:19:00,260 --> 00:19:01,060
Watch out!

702
00:19:02,160 --> 00:19:03,400
He ran him over!

703
00:19:04,940 --> 00:19:06,820
He didn't stop

704
00:19:05,380 --> 00:19:06,820
Well, after all...

705
00:19:06,820 --> 00:19:09,170
It was written here

706
00:19:07,760 --> 00:19:09,170
He didn't brake!

707
00:19:09,170 --> 00:19:10,400
He ran him over

708
00:19:10,400 --> 00:19:11,480
No brakes at all

709
00:19:10,680 --> 00:19:12,800
I see...

710
00:19:11,480 --> 00:19:12,800
My junior got run over

711
00:19:12,800 --> 00:19:13,800
Not a brake

712
00:19:13,940 --> 00:19:15,940
It was clearly written there

713
00:19:14,840 --> 00:19:15,940
That's right

714
00:19:15,940 --> 00:19:18,810
He raised the front wheel and ran him over with the other

715
00:19:18,810 --> 00:19:19,140
Today my boy got run over

716
00:19:19,140 --> 00:19:21,480
Today my boy got run over

717
00:19:22,500 --> 00:19:23,610
It hurts

718
00:19:26,920 --> 00:19:29,220
You can see the tire's mark

719
00:19:28,120 --> 00:19:28,940
You're right

720
00:19:28,940 --> 00:19:30,490
It's a clear hit

721
00:19:31,590 --> 00:19:33,990
Last one!

722
00:19:32,160 --> 00:19:33,990
Is it really?

723
00:19:32,660 --> 00:19:33,990
Yeah

724
00:19:33,990 --> 00:19:38,490
Isn't it about time for Hakamada to shine?

725
00:19:37,200 --> 00:19:39,130
He's right, do something

726
00:19:37,200 --> 00:19:39,130
I mean, he's the guest and all

727
00:19:39,130 --> 00:19:41,160
Yeah, a grand finale

728
00:19:39,740 --> 00:19:41,160
For the last one

729
00:19:41,160 --> 00:19:43,000
But we don't know what we'll get

730
00:19:44,370 --> 00:19:48,200
Endless grated yam

731
00:19:45,600 --> 00:19:47,070
What the--

732
00:19:48,540 --> 00:19:51,640
Endless grated yam

00:19:48,540 --> 00:19:51,640
topic

734
00:19:48,700 --> 00:19:50,060
Here's a dumb one

735
00:19:50,480 --> 00:19:52,040
Is it gonna be a shower?

736
00:19:52,040 --> 00:19:53,880
Well, yeah

737
00:19:52,040 --> 00:19:53,880
You bet it is

738
00:19:52,310 --> 00:19:56,910
An unexpected tragedy on their last punishment!

739
00:19:53,880 --> 00:19:55,780
Not this one...

740
00:19:57,280 --> 00:20:00,780
Gaki no Tsukai ya Arahende!

741
00:19:57,410 --> 00:20:00,780

One by one? Fine by me

757
00:20:13,420 --> 00:20:15,590
Let's flip it one by one, ok?

758
00:20:16,370 --> 00:20:17,230
Let's see

759
00:20:17,500 --> 00:20:19,270
Alright, flip it

760
00:20:19,560 --> 00:20:20,760
Here I go

761
00:20:21,120 --> 00:20:22,300
Please...

762
00:20:22,500 --> 00:20:23,780
Here I go

763
00:20:22,500 --> 00:20:25,670
Tanaka

764
00:20:24,460 --> 00:20:25,670
Alright!!

765
00:20:26,010 --> 00:20:29,080
Tanaka

766
00:20:26,240 --> 00:20:28,100
Oh yeah

767
00:20:29,220 --> 00:20:30,680
God, I don't want this

768
00:20:30,680 --> 00:20:32,980
I have a bad feeling about it

769
00:20:30,680 --> 00:20:32,980
One of this kind was still missing

770
00:20:33,120 --> 00:20:34,620
Come on

771
00:20:33,120 --> 00:20:34,620
You're right

772
00:20:34,620 --> 00:20:37,920
Let's get this over with

773
00:20:35,060 --> 00:20:37,920
I still don't want to do this

774
00:20:38,320 --> 00:20:39,520
I beg you

775
00:20:39,740 --> 00:20:40,670
Please

00:20:41,780 --> 00:20:43,680
Alright!!

778
00:20:43,760 --> 00:20:47,530
Hosei

779
00:20:46,100 --> 00:20:48,110
Wanna go now, Matsumoto?

780
00:20:48,920 --> 00:20:51,230
Or Endo?

781
00:20:49,720 --> 00:20:51,230
Me?

782
00:20:51,580 --> 00:20:54,480
I have no idea what to do...

783
00:20:52,580 --> 00:20:54,480
Just pick one

784
00:20:54,480 --> 00:20:57,060
I don't really want to get this one

785
00:20:55,170 --> 00:20:57,060
Come on, Endo

786
00:20:57,060 --> 00:20:58,240
Go for it

787
00:20:58,240 --> 00:20:59,400
Here goes nothing

788
00:20:59,400 --> 00:21:00,680
Please spare me

789
00:20:59,810 --> 00:21:03,180
Endo

790
00:21:03,410 --> 00:21:10,590
Endless grated yam

791
00:21:03,410 --> 00:21:10,590
Endo

792
00:21:03,410 --> 00:21:10,590
Shh

793
00:21:04,420 --> 00:21:06,590
Something's wrong

794
00:21:06,820 --> 00:21:09,660
That's not how it's supposed to be

795
00:21:11,090 --> 00:21:14,260
It should have been Hakamada here

796
00:21:12,640 --> 00:21:14,260
Why me now?!

797
00:21:14,260 --> 00:21:18,260
This sucks in so many ways

798
00:21:16,040 --> 00:21:17,440
I know

799
00:21:17,440 --> 00:21:18,710
But we can't help it

800
00:21:18,800 --> 00:21:21,960
It shouldn't have been me and you know it

801
00:21:20,740 --> 00:21:21,960
Yeah, but...

802
00:21:21,960 --> 00:21:23,630
That's not fair

803
00:21:22,300 --> 00:21:23,630
You're right

804
00:21:23,800 --> 00:21:30,970
You have to keep on eating a big quantity of grated yam
which is going to be poured down in your mouth

805
00:21:24,300 --> 00:21:26,260
That's pure bad luck

806
00:21:24,300 --> 00:21:26,260
You gotta be kidding me...

807
00:21:26,260 --> 00:21:27,040
Come on

808
00:21:27,040 --> 00:21:29,580
Lay down here

809
00:21:28,540 --> 00:21:29,580
Like this

810
00:21:29,580 --> 00:21:31,910
Ehh? Gimme a break...

811
00:21:31,980 --> 00:21:34,710
You gotta lay down exactly under it

812
00:21:35,040 --> 00:21:35,880
Maybe we can use Hakamada to measure it

813
00:21:35,880 --> 00:21:38,080
Maybe we can use Hakamada to measure it

814
00:21:38,860 --> 00:21:40,220
What do you mean?!

815
00:21:39,160 --> 00:21:40,220
What the--?

816
00:21:40,220 --> 00:21:42,850
Oh, you think so?

817
00:21:41,040 --> 00:21:42,850
What does that mean?

818
00:21:42,850 --> 00:21:45,320
I see, let's check how it is first...

819
00:21:45,320 --> 00:21:47,460
Hakamada--- I'm gonna do this

820
00:21:47,460 --> 00:21:49,840
I'm really going to, but before that

821
00:21:49,840 --> 00:21:50,820
Just lay down here

822
00:21:50,820 --> 00:21:52,980
So I can get how it works

823
00:21:50,820 --> 00:21:52,980
We gotta make sure it works

824
00:21:52,980 --> 00:21:54,140
Size and everything

825
00:21:54,140 --> 00:21:57,580
Then you can tell Endo where to lie

826
00:21:55,260 --> 00:21:57,580
That's right, it's a matter of size

827
00:21:57,970 --> 00:21:59,880
Sorry for this, I swear I'm doing it

828
00:21:59,880 --> 00:22:01,220
I don't know the size of it

829
00:21:59,880 --> 00:22:01,220
It's just for a second

830
00:22:01,220 --> 00:22:04,140
If I see it on him, I'll get it

831
00:22:01,860 --> 00:22:04,140
Your mouth should be under this

832
00:22:04,140 --> 00:22:05,160
How is it? Good?

833
00:22:05,160 --> 00:22:07,960
Lower, a bit lower than this

834
00:22:05,940 --> 00:22:07,960
How about now?

835
00:22:07,960 --> 00:22:10,050
A bit more

836
00:22:08,600 --> 00:22:10,050
Is this spot alright?

837
00:22:10,050 --> 00:22:11,900
I think it's ok

838
00:22:10,050 --> 00:22:11,900
Let's pour some down to check

839
00:22:11,900 --> 00:22:13,420
Yeah, just a lil bit

840
00:22:13,420 --> 00:22:15,750
Just a bit of it

841
00:22:13,820 --> 00:22:15,750
Make sure it goes to your mouth

842
00:22:15,860 --> 00:22:17,820
Ah, is that how it is?

843
00:22:15,860 --> 00:22:17,820
Open up

844
00:22:17,820 --> 00:22:20,140
Just like that, it works

845
00:22:17,820 --> 00:22:20,140
Now I see

846
00:22:20,140 --> 00:22:22,020
That's how it works, here comes

847
00:22:22,020 --> 00:22:23,260
Let's pour some more

848
00:22:23,460 --> 00:22:25,860
It's falling straight down to his mouth

849
00:22:24,020 --> 00:22:25,860
Stay still

850
00:22:26,060 --> 00:22:27,980
So that's how it is...

851
00:22:26,060 --> 00:22:27,980
Stay still

852
00:22:27,980 --> 00:22:28,740
This---

853
00:22:28,740 --> 00:22:32,820
Aren't you ready to swap in, Endo...?

854
00:22:29,200 --> 00:22:32,820
Now I know how I'm supposed to do it

855
00:22:33,180 --> 00:22:34,560
He's eating a lot

856
00:22:34,560 --> 00:22:36,640
We know how it is now

857
00:22:34,560 --> 00:22:36,640
What do you think Endo? Wanna do it?

858
00:22:36,640 --> 00:22:38,170
Ohh, I see how it is...

859
00:22:38,170 --> 00:22:39,360
Can you do it?

860
00:22:39,360 --> 00:22:40,910
It's coming out

861
00:22:41,600 --> 00:22:42,920
It's everywhere

862
00:22:42,920 --> 00:22:44,680
Ohh, looking good

863
00:22:43,580 --> 00:22:44,680
I see, I see

864
00:22:44,680 --> 00:22:46,150
Still not done yet?

865
00:22:46,150 --> 00:22:47,180
He's so good

866
00:22:47,180 --> 00:22:48,720
He can eat more

867
00:22:47,180 --> 00:22:48,720
How are you doing?

868
00:22:48,720 --> 00:22:50,290
He's good at piling up

869
00:22:48,720 --> 00:22:50,290
There's still room for it

870
00:22:50,290 --> 00:22:52,620
Eat some more

871
00:22:53,180 --> 00:22:54,140
Oh, shut up

872
00:22:54,140 --> 00:22:55,100
#"&%°

873
00:22:54,140 --> 00:22:55,100
Ok

874
00:22:55,100 --> 00:22:57,090
There's still half of it left

875
00:22:55,600 --> 00:22:57,090
&$!%#

876
00:22:59,560 --> 00:23:01,480
He's doing well, isn't he?

877
00:23:00,000 --> 00:23:01,480
Oh, he calmed down

878
00:23:01,480 --> 00:23:02,860
He's breathing

879
00:23:01,480 --> 00:23:02,860
It stopped

880
00:23:02,860 --> 00:23:04,930
Wanna go on?

881
00:23:02,960 --> 00:23:04,930
He's so calm now

882
00:23:04,930 --> 00:23:08,170
See? That's how you have to do it

883
00:23:06,520 --> 00:23:08,170
I see, that's how I'll do it

884
00:23:08,170 --> 00:23:09,100
Next time

885
00:23:09,340 --> 00:23:10,520
Next time?!

886
00:23:10,520 --> 00:23:12,310
Thanks so much

887
00:23:11,080 --> 00:23:12,310
We learned a lot

888
00:23:12,310 --> 00:23:13,980
Thank you for teaching it to me

889
00:23:13,980 --> 00:23:15,380
So that's how it works...

890
00:23:15,910 --> 00:23:19,050
Alright, we're going home

891
00:23:16,460 --> 00:23:17,600
Wait!!

892
00:23:17,680 --> 00:23:19,550
Stay like this

893
00:23:17,780 --> 00:23:19,550
Yeah, you'd make a mess

894
00:23:19,550 --> 00:23:20,460
Why?!

895
00:23:20,460 --> 00:23:22,920
Sorry for this

896
00:23:21,340 --> 00:23:22,920
You're gonna make a mess

897
00:23:22,920 --> 00:23:23,820
Thank you so much

898
00:23:23,820 --> 00:23:25,290
Don't make a mess here

899
00:23:23,820 --> 00:23:25,290
Switch that thing off!

900
00:23:25,290 --> 00:23:26,260
It's fine

901
00:23:26,260 --> 00:23:27,590
Hope we can meet again

902
00:23:26,260 --> 00:23:27,590
W-wait

903
00:23:27,590 --> 00:23:29,550
You're gonna be famous, Hakamada

904
00:23:30,080 --> 00:23:31,760
That's for sure

905
00:23:30,660 --> 00:23:31,760
Somebody!

906
00:23:31,760 --> 00:23:32,960
Somebody help me!

907
00:23:32,960 --> 00:23:34,060
Stop the yam!

908
00:23:34,260 --> 00:23:35,700
"Stop the yam"...

909
00:23:35,880 --> 00:23:37,470
The yam--

910
00:23:38,340 --> 00:23:39,640
'Scuse me sir

911
00:23:39,640 --> 00:23:40,820
You, over there

912
00:23:41,600 --> 00:23:42,840
Someone

913
00:23:42,840 --> 00:23:44,940
Stop the yam!

914
00:23:42,840 --> 00:23:44,940
They'll ignore him

915
00:23:45,060 --> 00:23:48,710
It's gonna itch so bad

916
00:23:45,820 --> 00:23:48,710
No doubt about it

917
00:23:48,710 --> 00:23:54,750
