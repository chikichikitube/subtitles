Ice Coffee

5
00:00:00,770 --> 00:00:03,710
Breaking down "ice coffee" to similar words such as ice mohhii

6
00:00:03,710 --> 00:00:06,220
The group tested the limits to see how far they can keep the order without saying the actual name

7
00:00:06,380 --> 00:00:07,850
"I'll have Ouyanfuifui"*

8
00:00:06,380 --> 00:00:15,660
*Ouyang Fei Fei - A Taiwanese singer

9
00:00:10,660 --> 00:00:12,520
"Ouyanfuifui"

10
00:00:13,360 --> 00:00:13,790
Ouyan Ice coffee

11
00:00:13,790 --> 00:00:15,160
Ouyan Ice coffee

12
00:00:14,330 --> 00:00:15,160
Ice Coffee?

13
00:00:16,290 --> 00:00:16,790
Ice Coffee?

14
00:00:17,290 --> 00:00:18,320
You said it didn't you?

15
00:00:18,800 --> 00:00:23,430
Cold Noodles

16
00:00:18,800 --> 00:00:23,430
Cold Noodles

17
00:00:19,280 --> 00:00:21,430
Previously, using "miyashi chuuka" or "suzuki chouka"

18
00:00:21,480 --> 00:00:24,040
The group embarked on ordering cold noodles (hiyashi chuuka) using phonetically similar words

19
00:00:24,100 --> 00:00:27,240
Umm suzuki kyouka

20
00:00:27,240 --> 00:00:28,470
Umm suzuki kyouka*

21
00:00:27,240 --> 00:00:37,880
*Japanese Actress

22
00:00:30,040 --> 00:00:30,810
Sui?...

23
00:00:30,810 --> 00:00:32,080
Suzuki Kyouka

24
00:00:32,880 --> 00:00:34,080
You mean suigyouza? (boiled dumplings)

25
00:00:34,080 --> 00:00:35,380
Yes, suigyouza

26
00:00:36,340 --> 00:00:38,250
Suigyouza!?(boiled dumplings)

27
00:00:39,020 --> 00:00:42,690
A new

28
00:00:39,020 --> 00:00:42,690
A new

29
00:00:39,020 --> 00:00:42,690
limit is reached!

30
00:00:39,020 --> 00:00:42,690
limit is reached!

31
00:00:39,140 --> 00:00:42,690
And this time, the group approaches a new limit!

32
00:00:43,050 --> 00:00:45,320
Gaki no Tsukai's third...

33
00:00:45,890 --> 00:00:49,190

Endo, take over

37
00:00:52,260 --> 00:00:53,700
Let's go

38
00:00:53,030 --> 00:00:55,870
Cocorico

39
00:00:53,030 --> 00:00:55,870
Endo Shozo

40
00:00:53,910 --> 00:00:54,500
Everyone!

41
00:00:57,530 --> 00:01:00,680
What does that mean?

42
00:00:58,070 --> 00:01:00,660
I'm just trying!

43
00:01:01,000 --> 00:01:03,770

00:01:01,000 --> 00:01:03,770
Tanaka Naoki

45
00:01:02,470 --> 00:01:03,460
Alright!

46
00:01:03,060 --> 00:01:03,440
Go ahead

47
00:01:03,950 --> 00:01:04,760
The third gek...

48
00:01:06,680 --> 00:01:12,220

62
00:01:18,310 --> 00:01:19,860
So mild seven!

63
00:01:19,910 --> 00:01:21,920
The limit of Mild Seven

64
00:01:20,190 --> 00:01:23,490
Yamazaki Hosei

65
00:01:21,960 --> 00:01:22,790
Yes, Mild Sevens

66
00:01:22,790 --> 00:01:24,880
We will be challenging ourselves with ordering Mild Sevens

67
00:01:24,880 --> 00:01:26,860
With ten alternative titles

68
00:01:26,330 --> 00:01:26,860
I see

69
00:01:26,860 --> 00:01:30,110
Have been prepared for us

70
00:01:30,110 --> 00:01:31,680
The transformation of "mild seven"

71
00:01:31,680 --> 00:01:33,160
The first one is

72
00:01:33,610 --> 00:01:34,130
this

73
00:01:34,390 --> 00:01:35,580
"Seven Mild"

74
00:01:35,880 --> 00:01:38,270
A simple switch

75
00:01:38,270 --> 00:01:41,410
An achievable goal

76
00:01:42,160 --> 00:01:43,070
Next

77
00:01:43,590 --> 00:01:44,580
"Tobacco Seven"

78
00:01:48,200 --> 00:01:49,910
How will this play out?

79
00:01:50,770 --> 00:01:53,470
This could be interesting in how it plays out

80
00:01:53,680 --> 00:01:55,490
This could bring you Seven Star (another brand of cigarettes)

81
00:01:55,500 --> 00:01:56,960
Ah Seven Star

82
00:01:56,960 --> 00:01:58,050
Alright next

83
00:01:58,340 --> 00:01:59,250
"Ultra Seven"

84
00:01:59,250 --> 00:02:01,690
This could be a bit of an extreme

85
00:02:02,660 --> 00:02:04,870
"Idol Kibun" (Idol feeling)

86
00:02:04,020 --> 00:02:04,870
Right

87
00:02:04,870 --> 00:02:06,400
This could be a hurdle

88
00:02:06,400 --> 00:02:07,770
It's starting to change

89
00:02:07,760 --> 00:02:08,470
So next

90
00:02:09,160 --> 00:02:11,410
"Maguro Gyosen" (tuna fishing boat)

91
00:02:11,410 --> 00:02:13,140
No one would buy a fishing boat there

92
00:02:13,140 --> 00:02:15,690
"Mild Seven" and "Maguro Gyosen"

93
00:02:15,770 --> 00:02:18,580
Could be possible

94
00:02:18,620 --> 00:02:19,290
And next

95
00:02:20,250 --> 00:02:22,150
"Maiko-san"

96
00:02:23,130 --> 00:02:23,640
Maiko-san

97
00:02:23,700 --> 00:02:25,440
The pronunciation could be key here

98
00:02:25,440 --> 00:02:26,750
Yes

99
00:02:26,750 --> 00:02:27,980
So next is

100
00:02:28,200 --> 00:02:30,080
"my sweet memory"

101
00:02:30,200 --> 00:02:31,970
That's completely different

102
00:02:33,330 --> 00:02:36,320
But when it comes to pronunciation, you could be wrong

103
00:02:36,320 --> 00:02:37,090
Ah

104
00:02:37,780 --> 00:02:40,410
And the last one here

105
00:02:41,510 --> 00:02:43,700
"Maetake Kyosen"*

106
00:02:41,510 --> 00:02:50,940
*Early comedy variety show from 1969-1970

107
00:02:43,830 --> 00:02:45,040
That's a bit old

108
00:02:45,040 --> 00:02:47,270
They're a little above our generation

109
00:02:47,270 --> 00:02:49,800
I'm sure some will understand this

110
00:02:50,330 --> 00:02:52,100
We'll have these three now

111
00:02:53,160 --> 00:02:54,110
How far is "Mild Seven"

112
00:02:54,430 --> 00:02:56,070
Still Mild Seven?

113
00:02:56,980 --> 00:02:58,610
Let's start!

114
00:03:01,190 --> 00:03:04,690
Mild Seven Limit

115
00:03:01,190 --> 00:03:04,690
Research Results

116
00:03:04,690 --> 00:03:07,230
Seven Mild

117
00:03:04,690 --> 00:03:07,230
Seven Mild

118
00:03:07,810 --> 00:03:08,760
Excuse me

119
00:03:08,300 --> 00:03:08,760
Yes

120
00:03:08,760 --> 00:03:12,560
One Seven Mild

121
00:03:10,300 --> 00:03:12,560
Mild Seven!?

122
00:03:12,920 --> 00:03:14,400
So this

123
00:03:13,290 --> 00:03:14,420
Ok

124
00:03:14,500 --> 00:03:16,500
Seven Mild

125
00:03:16,500 --> 00:03:19,000
Tobacco Seven

126
00:03:16,500 --> 00:03:19,000
Tobacco Seven

127
00:03:20,080 --> 00:03:21,210
Uh, Excuse me

128
00:03:21,570 --> 00:03:22,670
Uhh tobacco seven

129
00:03:22,670 --> 00:03:24,440
Uhh tobacco seven

130
00:03:26,550 --> 00:03:27,320
tobacco seven

131
00:03:27,430 --> 00:03:28,330
One

132
00:03:28,450 --> 00:03:30,580
What's tobacco seven?

133
00:03:30,790 --> 00:03:31,710
Tobacco seven

134
00:03:32,250 --> 00:03:34,920
Did you mean Seven Star?

135
00:03:33,660 --> 00:03:36,220
There

136
00:03:34,640 --> 00:03:36,220
Oh wow

137
00:03:37,020 --> 00:03:38,140
This?

138
00:03:39,890 --> 00:03:41,030
Tobacco Seven

139
00:03:41,560 --> 00:03:43,460
I believe this is it

140
00:03:45,000 --> 00:03:47,680
She's just pushing that one

141
00:03:46,500 --> 00:03:48,400
The box says Seven Star

142
00:03:48,700 --> 00:03:51,870
Seven Star of Tobacco

143
00:03:52,240 --> 00:03:55,910
Seven Star is brought out

144
00:03:52,240 --> 00:03:55,910
When asked for "Tobacco Seven"

145
00:03:53,870 --> 00:03:55,910
Tobacco Seven

146
00:03:55,910 --> 00:03:58,410
Ultra Seven

147
00:03:55,910 --> 00:03:58,410
Ultra Seven

148
00:03:58,930 --> 00:04:00,140
Excuse me

149
00:04:02,510 --> 00:04:06,420
Ultra Seven

150
00:04:03,510 --> 00:04:04,580
What? What Seven? Mild...

151
00:04:04,580 --> 00:04:05,320
What? What Seven? Mild...

152
00:04:05,320 --> 00:04:06,420
What? What Seven? Mild...

153
00:04:06,850 --> 00:04:08,390
Ultra Seven!?

154
00:04:09,340 --> 00:04:10,210
Is this fine?

155
00:04:10,320 --> 00:04:14,160
We don't have any cigarettes called Ultra Seven

156
00:04:10,730 --> 00:04:11,760
Please

157
00:04:14,160 --> 00:04:17,230
There are no cigarettes called Ultra Seven!

158
00:04:19,030 --> 00:04:20,460
Then... Seven Mild

159
00:04:20,460 --> 00:04:22,030
Then... Seven Mild

160
00:04:22,270 --> 00:04:24,130
Alright then, Mild Seven

161
00:04:22,530 --> 00:04:25,570
Scared of the clerk, Tanaka changes the name

162
00:04:24,130 --> 00:04:25,710
Seven Mild? Just one

163
00:04:25,030 --> 00:04:25,700
Alright

164
00:04:25,740 --> 00:04:26,520
Just one

165
00:04:26,260 --> 00:04:28,150
Don't change the name, Tanaka!

166
00:04:27,900 --> 00:04:29,940
Ultra Seven

167
00:04:28,150 --> 00:04:29,940
It was super scary

168
00:04:28,840 --> 00:04:29,940
You have to push past it!

169
00:04:29,910 --> 00:04:32,440
Idol Kibun (Idol Feeling)

170
00:04:29,910 --> 00:04:32,440
Idol Kibun (Idol Feeling)

171
00:04:32,880 --> 00:04:34,560
Uhm

172
00:04:37,150 --> 00:04:40,380
One Idol Kibun

173
00:04:39,010 --> 00:04:40,380
Huh?

174
00:04:39,260 --> 00:04:40,770
That's how you're feeling

175
00:04:40,720 --> 00:04:42,510
Idol Kibun

176
00:04:41,560 --> 00:04:42,960
Again with Idol Kibun

177
00:04:43,890 --> 00:04:44,620
Idol King?

178
00:04:44,620 --> 00:04:46,050
Idol King?

179
00:04:48,420 --> 00:04:49,470
Idol Kibun

180
00:04:49,470 --> 00:04:51,360
Not Idol King

181
00:04:52,970 --> 00:04:53,800
A Cigarette?

182
00:04:53,800 --> 00:04:56,000
Yes, the cigarette AiRUDO Kibun

183
00:04:56,460 --> 00:04:59,170
Not Mild Seven?

184
00:05:01,060 --> 00:05:02,350
Ah, yes thank you

185
00:05:01,270 --> 00:05:03,270
Idol Kibun (Idol Feeling)

186
00:05:03,270 --> 00:05:05,770
(Tuna Fishing Boat)

187
00:05:03,270 --> 00:05:05,770
Maguro Gyosen

188
00:05:03,270 --> 00:05:05,770
Maguro Gyosen

189
00:05:06,140 --> 00:05:06,790
Excuse me

190
00:05:06,890 --> 00:05:07,310
Yes?

191
00:05:07,540 --> 00:05:09,370
Can I please have a Maguro Gyosen

192
00:05:08,480 --> 00:05:11,050
Mild Seven!

193
00:05:09,340 --> 00:05:10,170
Wow!

194
00:05:09,370 --> 00:05:11,050
Maguro Gyosen please

195
00:05:12,100 --> 00:05:13,310
That was instant!

196
00:05:13,290 --> 00:05:14,320
This definitely works!

197
00:05:17,020 --> 00:05:19,450
This is Maguro Gyosen right!

198
00:05:19,450 --> 00:05:20,330
Yes, thank you very much

199
00:05:19,790 --> 00:05:23,120
Mild Seven is given as if he ordered it normally

200
00:05:20,330 --> 00:05:21,210
Alright thank you

201
00:05:21,210 --> 00:05:21,920
Thanks

202
00:05:23,120 --> 00:05:25,090
Maguro Gyosen (Tuna Fishing Boat)

203
00:05:25,090 --> 00:05:27,630
Maiko-san

204
00:05:25,090 --> 00:05:27,630
Maiko-san

205
00:05:28,360 --> 00:05:30,360
Uhhh Maiko-san

206
00:05:30,360 --> 00:05:32,400
Uhhh Maiko-san

207
00:05:31,170 --> 00:05:32,400
Euh?

208
00:05:33,170 --> 00:05:35,170
What's a Maiko-san?

209
00:05:35,170 --> 00:05:36,060
Uhh

210
00:05:37,170 --> 00:05:37,740
Huh?

211
00:05:37,950 --> 00:05:41,220
He could've said that better

212
00:05:38,640 --> 00:05:40,290
What's a Maiko-san?

213
00:05:42,280 --> 00:05:44,180
Then, I'll have Maiko-san

214
00:05:44,180 --> 00:05:45,680
Then, I'll have Maiko-san

215
00:05:46,780 --> 00:05:48,580
Marlboro-san?

216
00:05:51,050 --> 00:05:52,190
Maiko-san

217
00:05:52,190 --> 00:05:52,890
Aiko-san what're you saying?

218
00:05:52,890 --> 00:05:54,490
Aiko-san what're you saying?

219
00:05:54,920 --> 00:05:56,390
What is it!

220
00:05:55,460 --> 00:05:56,410
Maiko-san

221
00:05:57,260 --> 00:05:59,300
The lady thinks its Aiko-san

222
00:05:58,420 --> 00:06:00,240
Mild...

223
00:06:00,650 --> 00:06:01,930
What, you want mild?

224
00:06:04,150 --> 00:06:04,920
Mild...

225
00:06:05,130 --> 00:06:06,530
Three Milds?

226
00:06:07,030 --> 00:06:09,170
You want this right?

227
00:06:09,170 --> 00:06:10,770
Right?

228
00:06:12,680 --> 00:06:15,880
Maiko-san turned into
Mild Sanko (Three Milds)

229
00:06:15,860 --> 00:06:17,940
So three Mild Sevens then

230
00:06:17,980 --> 00:06:19,760
This woman's got a lot of power

231
00:06:18,140 --> 00:06:19,920
Three Mild Sevens then

232
00:06:20,150 --> 00:06:22,080
Three Mild Sevens

233
00:06:23,250 --> 00:06:25,100
Mairudo San, right? (Three Milds)

234
00:06:25,820 --> 00:06:27,770
Which country are you from?

235
00:06:26,890 --> 00:06:28,920
Maiko-san

236
00:06:36,700 --> 00:06:38,060
Hm?

237
00:06:37,190 --> 00:06:38,060
My sweet memory

238
00:06:38,200 --> 00:06:39,360
Memory?

239
00:06:39,550 --> 00:06:40,440
My sweet memory

240
00:06:40,500 --> 00:06:41,530
Menthol?

241
00:06:41,870 --> 00:06:42,430
Memory?

242
00:06:42,590 --> 00:06:44,270
Mai Sen Memori

243
00:06:44,360 --> 00:06:45,810
This is shaky

244
00:06:44,900 --> 00:06:48,040
We have Mild Seven Light if that's what you mean

245
00:06:46,310 --> 00:06:47,940
It was scary

246
00:06:46,310 --> 00:06:48,050
I don't think we know what you're talking about

247
00:06:48,390 --> 00:06:49,540
I've never heard of memories

248
00:06:49,540 --> 00:06:51,740
Tobacco?

249
00:06:50,600 --> 00:06:51,740
Extra?

250
00:06:51,390 --> 00:06:52,220
My sweememroy

251
00:06:52,980 --> 00:06:55,980
The three employees panic

252
00:06:56,170 --> 00:06:58,960
I've never heard of them

253
00:06:56,880 --> 00:07:02,490
Tanaka begins to get ignored

254
00:06:56,880 --> 00:07:02,490
Trying to stretch this out

255
00:06:58,960 --> 00:07:00,160
My sweet memory, one please

256
00:07:00,510 --> 00:07:01,680
What is memory?

257
00:07:02,650 --> 00:07:03,400
Then..

258
00:07:03,400 --> 00:07:05,380
You're not talking about menthol right?

259
00:07:05,380 --> 00:07:07,850
I'm sorry

260
00:07:08,690 --> 00:07:11,200
Maetake Kyosen

261
00:07:08,690 --> 00:07:11,200
Maetake Kyosen

262
00:07:11,570 --> 00:07:12,450
Excuse me

263
00:07:14,100 --> 00:07:16,230
One maetake kyosen

264
00:07:16,030 --> 00:07:18,110
He said it so clearly

265
00:07:18,340 --> 00:07:20,370
Maetake kyosen?

266
00:07:19,500 --> 00:07:20,370
Maetake kyosen.

267
00:07:20,370 --> 00:07:22,100
Eh?

268
00:07:23,110 --> 00:07:25,980
What is this maetake kyosen?

269
00:07:24,900 --> 00:07:25,970
It's maetake kyosen

270
00:07:28,010 --> 00:07:30,450
It feels a little light

271
00:07:32,270 --> 00:07:34,060
When some people order Mild Seven

272
00:07:34,320 --> 00:07:37,150
They like to call it maitake

273
00:07:37,150 --> 00:07:39,730
So when people want Mild Seven they ask for maitake?

274
00:07:39,730 --> 00:07:41,970
They call Mild Seven Light "maitake"

275
00:07:41,970 --> 00:07:43,230
Some call it maitake?

276
00:07:43,230 --> 00:07:45,330
A good amount of people call it that

277
00:07:44,230 --> 00:07:45,330
Oh, really!

278
00:07:45,860 --> 00:07:48,430
But maetake kyosen is...

279
00:07:48,430 --> 00:07:50,430
Maetake Kyosen

280
00:07:50,770 --> 00:07:52,770
Well out of ten...

281
00:07:52,770 --> 00:07:54,710
Six of them went through

282
00:07:55,120 --> 00:07:57,080
Were somewhat safe

283
00:07:57,550 --> 00:07:59,960
These are the results but now...

284
00:07:59,960 --> 00:08:01,830
Both of us, as Downtown will go

285
00:08:03,000 --> 00:08:04,210
So we'll finish with this!

286
00:08:05,570 --> 00:08:08,620
Maikeru Tomioka (Michael Tomioka)

287
00:08:06,910 --> 00:08:08,610
This might be a bit of a long shot

288
00:08:08,800 --> 00:08:09,660
This is fine

289
00:08:09,660 --> 00:08:12,530
The only similarity is "Mi"

290
00:08:12,530 --> 00:08:14,000
It also ends with "tomioka" too, so

291
00:08:13,990 --> 00:08:15,960
We also have "ru"

292
00:08:16,680 --> 00:08:17,420
So, Matsumoto-san

293
00:08:17,420 --> 00:08:17,910
Yes, yes

294
00:08:17,910 --> 00:08:19,180
So we're going to a café

295
00:08:18,830 --> 00:08:21,900
Completely disguised to test

296
00:08:18,830 --> 00:08:21,900
Downtown heads to a café

297
00:08:19,180 --> 00:08:20,660
This is a good way to test this

298
00:08:20,660 --> 00:08:22,750
It's relatively common to ask for cigarettes at a café

299
00:08:23,180 --> 00:08:24,960
So we ask for Michael Tomioka

300
00:08:25,070 --> 00:08:27,600
And see if we can get Mild Sevens

301
00:08:26,720 --> 00:08:27,600
Yeah

302
00:08:27,600 --> 00:08:29,120
So let's see if it works

303
00:08:29,270 --> 00:08:30,020
Let's go

304
00:08:31,470 --> 00:08:34,280
Will the duo really

305
00:08:31,470 --> 00:08:34,280
be able to buy Mild Seven?

306
00:08:31,880 --> 00:08:34,280
Will the duo be able to buy Mild Seven?

307
00:08:35,610 --> 00:08:38,810
The results will be on

308
00:08:35,610 --> 00:08:38,810
later in the show!!

309
00:08:39,030 --> 00:08:42,800
Mild Seven Limit

310
00:08:39,030 --> 00:08:42,800
Research Results

311
00:08:44,000 --> 00:08:46,300
Can I have the ice milk tea

312
00:08:45,340 --> 00:08:46,300
One ice milk tea

313
00:08:46,740 --> 00:08:47,170
Alright

314
00:08:48,370 --> 00:08:51,710
Uhhhm ouyan ice coffee

315
00:08:51,710 --> 00:08:54,850
Uhhhm ouyan ice coffee

316
00:08:52,840 --> 00:08:54,850
Ice coffee. Right.

317
00:08:53,480 --> 00:08:54,850
Yes

318
00:08:55,750 --> 00:08:57,280
Clear for now!

319
00:08:57,310 --> 00:08:58,550
It's not clear yet!

320
00:09:01,850 --> 00:09:04,920
Will ordering Michael Tomioka

321
00:09:01,850 --> 00:09:04,920
be able to get them Mild Seven!?

322
00:09:03,920 --> 00:09:05,520
Looks like ice coffee came first

323
00:09:05,890 --> 00:09:06,820
Do you have any tobacco?

324
00:09:06,820 --> 00:09:07,390
Yes ,what would you like?

325
00:09:07,390 --> 00:09:08,790
Yes, what would you like?

326
00:09:08,860 --> 00:09:10,630
Michael Tomioka!

327
00:09:13,260 --> 00:09:15,070
In terms of mild

328
00:09:15,470 --> 00:09:16,830
Which Mild?

329
00:09:16,830 --> 00:09:18,200
The Tomioka

330
00:09:17,840 --> 00:09:18,200
Eh!

331
00:09:18,270 --> 00:09:19,900
The Tomioka ones

332
00:09:21,740 --> 00:09:23,740
Do you have Michael Tomioka?

333
00:09:23,740 --> 00:09:24,070
...there are none of them

334
00:09:24,070 --> 00:09:25,280
...there are none of them

335
00:09:29,450 --> 00:09:31,520
I'm not sure but in terms of Milds we have

336
00:09:31,520 --> 00:09:32,280
The regular ones. is that fine?

337
00:09:32,280 --> 00:09:33,450
The regular ones. Is that fine?

338
00:09:35,390 --> 00:09:36,420
Here it comes

339
00:09:36,650 --> 00:09:37,820
That's OK

340
00:09:38,120 --> 00:09:39,320
That's OK!

341
00:09:40,120 --> 00:09:41,660
We have a lot of milds so I wasn't sure

342
00:09:41,860 --> 00:09:44,700
Yes, those are the Tomiokas

343
00:09:43,430 --> 00:09:44,700
That's what they're called

344
00:09:45,000 --> 00:09:45,960
Alright

345
00:09:48,430 --> 00:09:50,730
When you said the Tomiokas..

346
00:09:52,670 --> 00:09:56,570
How could anyone judge like this?

347
00:09:58,410 --> 00:10:00,080
But it still came!

348
00:10:00,280 --> 00:10:03,610
Michael Tomioka

349
00:10:00,580 --> 00:10:03,610
It's exactly what I wanted

350
00:10:00,940 --> 00:10:03,650
With enough convincing

351
00:10:03,910 --> 00:10:05,880
Oh, here it is!

352
00:10:06,550 --> 00:10:07,990
Ours is definitely good!

353
00:10:07,990 --> 00:10:08,750
Oh, yeah?

354
00:10:08,020 --> 00:10:12,020
Lady continues to not recognize Downtown

355
00:10:08,020 --> 00:10:12,020
Throughout the end

356
00:10:09,250 --> 00:10:10,590
I promise you

357
00:10:10,590 --> 00:10:11,860
Thank you

358
00:10:11,860 --> 00:10:13,160
Ouyan fuifui

359
00:10:13,460 --> 00:10:16,630
Saying silly things again

360
00:10:16,630 --> 00:10:18,860
I don't know what you're saying

361
00:10:19,860 --> 00:10:21,600
I realized one thing

362
00:10:21,600 --> 00:10:23,870
When you do these challenges

363
00:10:24,230 --> 00:10:26,970
You make a favorable impression towards the employees

364
00:10:27,770 --> 00:10:28,910
In a way

365
00:10:29,440 --> 00:10:31,480
That's because you're trying to be nice

366
00:10:32,610 --> 00:10:35,180
Well I'm not so...
