1
00:00:00,440 --> 00:00:04,780
First time ever on Gaki no Tsukai ya Arahende...

2
00:00:04,780 --> 00:00:07,500
..."Who is the most convincing?" Self-health presentation!

3
00:00:12,540 --> 00:00:15,040
I'm sure you know this already, but...

4
00:00:15,040 --> 00:00:18,700
...out of the five of us, I'm the smartest.

5
00:00:18,700 --> 00:00:23,280
Today we'll see how much of it I can show it off to you.

6
00:00:23,280 --> 00:00:25,280
How am I supposed to feel?

7
00:00:26,340 --> 00:00:29,200
We all drifted off, somewhere far.

8
00:00:29,320 --> 00:00:31,200
That means that none of us are convinced...

9
00:00:31,200 --> 00:00:34,440
...of him being that smart.

10
00:00:35,760 --> 00:00:36,880
Well, whatever.

11
00:00:36,880 --> 00:00:38,880
We'll now be given the subjects to study.

12
00:00:40,980 --> 00:00:44,560
We have a library at our disposal.

13
00:00:44,560 --> 00:00:48,140
We'll compile materials and give a presentation.

14
00:00:48,920 --> 00:00:51,780
First the health-related subjects are decided with a lottery.

15
00:00:53,780 --> 00:00:57,460
High Blood Pressure

16
00:00:53,780 --> 00:00:57,460
This is going to be complex!

17
00:00:57,460 --> 00:00:59,360
I don't have the faintest idea about high blood pressure!

18
00:01:00,060 --> 00:01:02,740
Furthermore, Hamada got aging prevention...

19
00:01:00,060 --> 00:01:09,380
T/N: Background music is "Winter Winner" by Orange Range

20
00:01:02,740 --> 00:01:04,000
...Yamasaki got hip pain...

21
00:01:04,000 --> 00:01:05,280
...Endo got summer fatigue...

22
00:01:05,280 --> 00:01:07,140
...and Tanaka got bad breath.

23
00:01:07,140 --> 00:01:09,380
What kind of presentations will they give?

24
00:01:10,400 --> 00:01:13,040
To study about their subjects...

25
00:01:13,040 --> 00:01:15,380
...they went to a library to gather materials.

26
00:01:15,380 --> 00:01:17,880
We can't be too loud here.

27
00:01:19,470 --> 00:01:21,810
It reminds me of the Silent Library series.

28
00:01:21,810 --> 00:01:23,410
That brings back bad memories.

29
00:01:23,410 --> 00:01:25,520
Anyway, let's go.

30
00:01:25,840 --> 00:01:30,400
The search for materials to study begins right away.

31
00:01:31,450 --> 00:01:33,860
I can't go without checking this one.

32
00:01:42,920 --> 00:01:47,130
I'm at a dead end already.

33
00:01:52,510 --> 00:01:55,720
I am completely lost.

34
00:01:57,140 --> 00:01:59,140
I don't know how to approach it.

35
00:02:00,020 --> 00:02:01,600
Don't know at all.

36
00:02:02,450 --> 00:02:06,080
Will Endo be able to find the materials he needs?

37
00:02:06,080 --> 00:02:08,080
Meanwhile, his partner Tanaka...

38
00:02:09,220 --> 00:02:12,020
Bad breath bye-bye! Bad breath bye-bye!

39
00:02:16,060 --> 00:02:18,220
Bad breath bye-bye.

40
00:02:22,180 --> 00:02:24,180
Found them!

41
00:02:29,610 --> 00:02:31,960
There's a lot of them!

42
00:02:39,880 --> 00:02:41,360
Alright!

43
00:02:43,220 --> 00:02:46,190
Hamada has also finally found something.

44
00:02:46,930 --> 00:02:47,800
I've had enough.

45
00:02:47,800 --> 00:02:50,830
Can I take these with me?

46
00:02:54,140 --> 00:02:55,140
Why??

47
00:02:59,400 --> 00:03:01,600
After gathering the materials...

48
00:03:01,600 --> 00:03:03,500
...they proceed to making the presentations.

49
00:03:04,540 --> 00:03:08,060
The Gaki members are unusually serious about their presentations.

50
00:03:11,880 --> 00:03:17,500
"...this survey was done on 288 people by Kanebo..."

51
00:03:11,880 --> 00:03:17,500
T/N: Kanebo is a major cosmetic brand in Japan.

52
00:03:18,240 --> 00:03:24,330
"...raise your feet to a 90 degree angle and do this..."

53
00:03:33,560 --> 00:03:37,230
I've never drawn a picture like this.

54
00:03:40,900 --> 00:03:42,930
Never ever.

55
00:03:42,930 --> 00:03:44,930
What am I going to do?

56
00:03:47,540 --> 00:03:49,540
Will Hamada's picture be completed?

57
00:03:49,540 --> 00:03:52,330
Will he be able to give the presentation?

58
00:04:04,320 --> 00:04:07,300
Everyone, are you feeling a bit tired?

59
00:04:07,300 --> 00:04:10,780
We had about two hours.

60
00:04:10,780 --> 00:04:14,240
Frankly, I ran out of time.

61
00:04:14,240 --> 00:04:16,700
I'm usually better than this.

62
00:04:16,920 --> 00:04:18,020
I study more before doing things.

63
00:04:18,020 --> 00:04:20,020
Well let's just do the presentations already.

64
00:04:22,700 --> 00:04:26,950
Tanaka is the top batter.  He has the subject of "bad breath".

65
00:04:32,520 --> 00:04:38,220
This spring, two subordinates come to you.

66
00:04:38,220 --> 00:04:41,800
But you can only hire one.

67
00:04:42,810 --> 00:04:48,020
They both have equal looks, ability...

68
00:04:48,020 --> 00:04:50,020
...judgment, and character.

69
00:04:50,680 --> 00:04:54,120
However, one of them has bad breath.

70
00:04:54,120 --> 00:04:57,360
The other does not have bad breath.

71
00:04:57,360 --> 00:04:59,600
In that case, which one do you choose?

72
00:04:59,860 --> 00:05:01,040
Yes, Hamada-san?

73
00:05:01,380 --> 00:05:03,820
If at all possible, the one without bad breath.

74
00:05:03,820 --> 00:05:04,800
Exactly!

75
00:05:05,540 --> 00:05:07,980
Bad breath can cause problems...

76
00:05:07,980 --> 00:05:09,980
...in school...at work...

77
00:05:09,980 --> 00:05:13,160
...or at home.

78
00:05:13,270 --> 00:05:15,400
What is this bumbling, are you ok?

79
00:05:15,400 --> 00:05:17,860
I'd now like to talk to you about bad breath.

80
00:05:17,860 --> 00:05:20,450
Your introduction was so long!

81
00:05:21,860 --> 00:05:26,560
Two meters.

82
00:05:26,960 --> 00:05:29,760
What do you think this distance is?

83
00:05:30,090 --> 00:05:32,990
How far bad breath reaches.

84
00:05:33,600 --> 00:05:35,140
Precisely.

85
00:05:38,520 --> 00:05:41,420
Did you really have to cover that?

86
00:05:41,420 --> 00:05:46,420
I'd like to do an experiment now.

87
00:05:47,480 --> 00:05:50,210
A bad breath check you can easily do at home too!

88
00:05:50,210 --> 00:05:53,400
I'll give each of you a cup.

89
00:05:53,760 --> 00:05:55,400
You prepared all this?

90
00:05:58,520 --> 00:06:01,620
Breathe into the cup, and put your hand over the top.

91
00:06:03,620 --> 00:06:05,720
Then, take a deep breath.

92
00:06:08,180 --> 00:06:09,650
Now, sniff the cup.

93
00:06:12,240 --> 00:06:14,620
How about it?

94
00:06:14,620 --> 00:06:16,220
Can you detect your own bad breath?

95
00:06:16,220 --> 00:06:20,270
It kind of stunk when I took the deep breath.

96
00:06:20,270 --> 00:06:22,510
I'd like you to look at this flipcard.

97
00:06:24,040 --> 00:06:29,850
Kanebo did this study in 1994 to men and women aged 18 to 25.

98
00:06:29,850 --> 00:06:32,850
That survey is damn old.

99
00:06:32,850 --> 00:06:32,850
More than 10 years ago!

100
00:06:34,660 --> 00:06:37,820
Teacher! I don't care!

101
00:06:37,820 --> 00:06:41,100
Let's just look at it, ok?

102
00:06:40,000 --> 00:06:41,100
Who cares, it's 12 years old!

103
00:06:41,100 --> 00:06:43,520
Ideas might have changed already.

104
00:06:43,520 --> 00:06:45,520
Smells people like!  Third is...

105
00:06:46,600 --> 00:06:50,560
...freshly baked bread.

106
00:06:48,400 --> 00:06:50,560
I don't think that's right.

107
00:06:50,560 --> 00:06:52,160
I don't think too many people say that.

108
00:06:52,160 --> 00:06:54,600
Number two.

109
00:06:54,600 --> 00:06:56,460
Flowers.

110
00:06:56,460 --> 00:07:01,360
And number one is soap's natural scent.

111
00:07:01,360 --> 00:07:02,360
Because Kanebo did the survey.

112
00:07:02,360 --> 00:07:04,360
It's the Pink Lady era!

113
00:07:02,360 --> 00:07:04,360
T/N: Pink Lady was a female pop music duo popular in the late 70s and early 80s.

114
00:07:04,360 --> 00:07:05,840
And now...bad smells.

115
00:07:05,840 --> 00:07:07,500
It's not that old.

116
00:07:07,500 --> 00:07:08,800
Third most hated is...

117
00:07:08,800 --> 00:07:10,060
...body odor.

118
00:07:10,060 --> 00:07:12,820
That goes without saying.

119
00:07:12,820 --> 00:07:14,330
Number two is...

120
00:07:14,330 --> 00:07:16,740
...kitchen waste.

121
00:07:16,740 --> 00:07:19,880
And of course number one...

122
00:07:19,880 --> 00:07:21,120
...is bad breath.

123
00:07:21,120 --> 00:07:22,840
I could see that coming.

124
00:07:22,840 --> 00:07:27,610
Bad breath ranks higher than kitchen waste.

125
00:07:27,610 --> 00:07:30,720
Have a look at this other flipcard too.

126
00:07:31,080 --> 00:07:36,150
The drug company Nihon Kayaku, in 1990...

127
00:07:33,480 --> 00:07:36,150
That's even older!

128
00:07:39,760 --> 00:07:41,190
You lose interest right away!

129
00:07:42,260 --> 00:07:45,260
Of course, number one is... bad breath.

130
00:07:45,260 --> 00:07:48,040
That's the subject, after all.

131
00:07:48,620 --> 00:07:51,320
And bad breath is number one for women, too.

132
00:07:51,320 --> 00:07:53,200
Wow, about eight out of ten.

133
00:07:53,200 --> 00:07:58,180
That's right.  Eight out of ten people, both men and women, hate it.

134
00:07:58,180 --> 00:08:00,360
But it's from 15 years ago.

135
00:07:59,600 --> 00:08:00,360
That's true.

136
00:08:00,860 --> 00:08:03,600
The question is, "who is a partner I would not want to marry?"

137
00:08:03,600 --> 00:08:05,200
What's the point in covering them?!

138
00:08:05,200 --> 00:08:07,320
"Somebody whose mouth stinks."

139
00:08:08,000 --> 00:08:09,760
This is the theme, we know it.

140
00:08:10,320 --> 00:08:13,020
How many visits to the doctor...

141
00:08:13,020 --> 00:08:15,020
...does it take to get rid of bad breath?

142
00:08:15,020 --> 00:08:20,180
Can it be healed?

143
00:08:16,440 --> 00:08:21,560
Yes. Depending on the treatment, you can cure it!

144
00:08:20,180 --> 00:08:21,560
Is that so?

145
00:08:22,600 --> 00:08:24,720
How many times do you think, Endo?

146
00:08:24,960 --> 00:08:26,830
Five times?

147
00:08:26,960 --> 00:08:28,420
Endo!

148
00:08:32,220 --> 00:08:34,000
I got it right.

149
00:08:34,000 --> 00:08:35,500
That's pretty embarrassing.

150
00:08:35,500 --> 00:08:37,380
I got it right.

151
00:08:37,380 --> 00:08:39,220
He looked really annoyed just then!

152
00:08:39,220 --> 00:08:41,380
That's the end of my presentation on bad breath.

153
00:08:42,460 --> 00:08:43,960
That was great!

154
00:08:46,180 --> 00:08:48,380
Next up is Yamasaki who is full of confidence.

155
00:08:48,380 --> 00:08:50,480
His subject is "hip pain."

156
00:08:56,620 --> 00:08:58,520
My subject is "hip pain."

157
00:08:58,520 --> 00:09:01,000
When you think of hip pain, what image do you conjure?

158
00:09:01,000 --> 00:09:04,360
I don't understand what the hell you're saying.

159
00:09:04,360 --> 00:09:07,800
When you hear "hip pain," what does it make you think about?

160
00:09:07,800 --> 00:09:10,110
Old age.

161
00:09:08,580 --> 00:09:10,110
Old age, yeah.

162
00:09:10,140 --> 00:09:14,820
Well, old age ... and stuff like that.

163
00:09:15,280 --> 00:09:17,120
What the hell was the point of that?!

164
00:09:18,960 --> 00:09:21,240
You should show us something!

165
00:09:21,240 --> 00:09:24,840
I'm so envious of gags like that.

166
00:09:24,840 --> 00:09:26,480
Three things.

167
00:09:26,980 --> 00:09:30,320
We can divide hip pain into three things.

168
00:09:30,320 --> 00:09:32,240
Let's look at this first.

169
00:09:32,740 --> 00:09:34,240
First of all...

170
00:09:34,240 --> 00:09:38,880
(Blank) on the hip exceeds its strength.

171
00:09:39,400 --> 00:09:41,880
Matsumoto, what is placed on the hip?

172
00:09:41,880 --> 00:09:43,910
Umm... Stress?

173
00:09:43,300 --> 00:09:43,910
Yes.

174
00:09:46,420 --> 00:09:47,860
We got another one right.

175
00:09:47,860 --> 00:09:49,300
Yes, you did.

176
00:09:49,440 --> 00:09:51,030
Number two...

177
00:09:51,030 --> 00:09:52,460
...the (blank) itself is abnormal.

178
00:09:52,460 --> 00:09:53,960
How about it, Tanaka?

179
00:09:54,160 --> 00:09:55,380
Well...

180
00:09:55,380 --> 00:09:56,380
...the hip?

181
00:09:56,660 --> 00:09:57,660
No way.

182
00:09:57,660 --> 00:09:59,160
Yes.

183
00:10:01,300 --> 00:10:04,840
It fit in there so perfectly.

184
00:10:04,840 --> 00:10:07,940
It was the only reasonable answer.

185
00:10:07,940 --> 00:10:10,720
You should at least try to hide the length of the word.

186
00:10:10,720 --> 00:10:11,860
Let's take a look...

187
00:10:11,860 --> 00:10:14,680
...at who is at highest risk of having hip problems.

188
00:10:14,840 --> 00:10:16,600
Everyday life ranking.

189
00:10:16,600 --> 00:10:19,180
This was quite interesting to me as well.

190
00:10:19,180 --> 00:10:21,820
What do you mean, "everyday life?"

191
00:10:20,460 --> 00:10:21,820
Yeah, what does that mean?

192
00:10:21,820 --> 00:10:23,920
When you live your life.

193
00:10:23,920 --> 00:10:26,920
Is it about when you might get hip problems?

194
00:10:25,000 --> 00:10:26,920
Yes, that's it.

195
00:10:26,920 --> 00:10:29,180
Where excessive stress is placed on the hip.

196
00:10:28,500 --> 00:10:29,180
Yes.

197
00:10:29,340 --> 00:10:30,640
Number three.

198
00:10:32,000 --> 00:10:33,620
Night shifts.

199
00:10:33,620 --> 00:10:35,480
Oh, so it's like that.

200
00:10:35,480 --> 00:10:37,620
That's when it's easy to get pain in the hip.

201
00:10:37,620 --> 00:10:40,400
Especially men.

202
00:10:40,580 --> 00:10:43,300
Let's have number two.  What do you think it is?

203
00:10:43,300 --> 00:10:45,760
Washing the dishes, or something like that?

204
00:10:44,940 --> 00:10:45,760
Washing the dishes...

205
00:10:45,760 --> 00:10:47,430
...is actually number one.

206
00:10:49,690 --> 00:10:50,820
Household chores.

207
00:10:52,160 --> 00:10:55,650
Housewives are right up there at number one.

208
00:10:55,780 --> 00:11:00,200
Well now I don't care about number two any more.

209
00:11:00,200 --> 00:11:01,960
We don't care.

210
00:11:02,330 --> 00:11:03,330
Here it is.

211
00:11:03,330 --> 00:11:04,830
"Playing."

212
00:11:05,960 --> 00:11:12,030
(* - This is Yamasaki's own ranking and has no basis in reality.)

213
00:11:06,160 --> 00:11:08,360
What the hell do you mean, "playing"?

214
00:11:10,900 --> 00:11:14,500
Yama-chan's "You Gotta Remember This!"

215
00:11:15,080 --> 00:11:17,740
You have to memorize...

216
00:11:17,740 --> 00:11:19,920
...what's best in foodstuffs.

217
00:11:19,920 --> 00:11:21,030
What do you mean?

218
00:11:21,180 --> 00:11:27,180
Vitamin B and calcium are good for hips.

219
00:11:27,180 --> 00:11:29,750
What do you think is best, among foods?

220
00:11:29,750 --> 00:11:30,920
Eggs?

221
00:11:30,920 --> 00:11:32,160
Eggs are close.

222
00:11:33,150 --> 00:11:34,560
What about cheese?

223
00:11:34,560 --> 00:11:36,560
Endo is correct!

224
00:11:40,660 --> 00:11:42,420
That ripped off really cleanly.

225
00:11:42,680 --> 00:11:44,680
Why did you hide the entire card?!

226
00:11:46,120 --> 00:11:48,180
Today, on this special occasion, I've brought cheese.

227
00:11:50,520 --> 00:11:52,520
We've all seen cheese before.

228
00:11:55,420 --> 00:11:58,120
I don't need to look at it.

229
00:11:58,340 --> 00:12:00,400
Please, take it.

230
00:12:00,400 --> 00:12:01,900
I don't want to.

231
00:12:02,380 --> 00:12:03,500
We know what cheese is.

232
00:12:10,520 --> 00:12:12,340
We don't want it.

233
00:12:12,540 --> 00:12:15,540
That's the end of my hip pain presentation.

234
00:12:16,300 --> 00:12:17,300
Thank you.

235
00:12:18,800 --> 00:12:21,140
Next up is Endo, who had trouble in the library.

236
00:12:21,140 --> 00:12:22,940
His subject is "summer fatigue."

237
00:12:25,570 --> 00:12:28,160
Out of the five of us, he's the problem child.

238
00:12:28,780 --> 00:12:35,480
Hello.  I'd like to tell you about summer fatigue.

239
00:12:35,480 --> 00:12:37,580
When you hear "summer fab-... summer fatigue"...

240
00:12:39,840 --> 00:12:41,340
...summer fatigue...

241
00:12:42,700 --> 00:12:45,520
Let's look at the issue on a planetary scale.

242
00:12:45,520 --> 00:12:47,160
That's a big scale.

243
00:12:49,780 --> 00:12:52,880
What's El Niño?

244
00:12:54,180 --> 00:12:57,160
You have some sort of an idea, right?

245
00:12:55,640 --> 00:12:57,160
Well, I've heard of it.

246
00:12:59,160 --> 00:13:02,840
El Niño is a phenomenon in South America...

247
00:13:02,840 --> 00:13:05,190
...where on Ecuador and Peru's coast...

248
00:13:05,190 --> 00:13:09,080
...every 4-5 years, sea temperatures rise.

249
00:13:09,080 --> 00:13:11,560
You have the explanation here.

250
00:13:11,560 --> 00:13:14,400
So you just copied that text.

251
00:13:13,840 --> 00:13:16,840
I'd like you to understand this first.

252
00:13:16,940 --> 00:13:19,560
He just keeps turning the pages.

253
00:13:20,460 --> 00:13:23,560
I can't memorize anything!

254
00:13:23,560 --> 00:13:25,120
Just look at this first.

255
00:13:25,300 --> 00:13:28,060
Do you know what this is?

256
00:13:26,140 --> 00:13:28,060
Summer fatigue?

257
00:13:28,460 --> 00:13:30,380
The El Niño phenomenon.

258
00:13:30,960 --> 00:13:33,920
What's the point in covering that?!

259
00:13:34,880 --> 00:13:39,040
It changes the atmospheric currents...

260
00:13:39,040 --> 00:13:40,540
...and causes what around the world?

261
00:13:41,140 --> 00:13:42,460
What comes before low temperatures?

262
00:13:43,000 --> 00:13:45,370
Tanaka-san?  Before low temperatures?

263
00:13:45,370 --> 00:13:46,400
Well, not before.

264
00:13:46,400 --> 00:13:48,880
This is a hint.

265
00:13:47,500 --> 00:13:48,880
High temperatures?

266
00:13:51,480 --> 00:13:56,020
It causes high and low temperatures, rains and drought...

267
00:13:56,020 --> 00:13:59,100
...which causes...?

268
00:13:57,520 --> 00:13:59,100
Calamities?

269
00:13:59,540 --> 00:14:01,100
Abnormal weather conditions.

270
00:14:01,100 --> 00:14:03,270
El Niño causes abnormal weather conditions right now.

271
00:14:04,080 --> 00:14:06,900
Abnormal weather conditions mean that...

272
00:14:06,900 --> 00:14:11,140
...winters are getting colder all the time.

273
00:14:12,140 --> 00:14:14,420
Summers are getting hotter and hotter.

274
00:14:15,840 --> 00:14:17,350
When it gets hot, what fatigue is it?

275
00:14:17,350 --> 00:14:19,720
When it gets hot, what fatigue is it?

276
00:14:20,180 --> 00:14:22,040
That took forever!

277
00:14:21,040 --> 00:14:22,040
Summer fatigue!

278
00:14:22,740 --> 00:14:24,000
You get summer fatigue.

279
00:14:24,000 --> 00:14:27,620
Let's talk about summer fatigue now.

280
00:14:26,000 --> 00:14:27,620
Finally.

281
00:14:27,620 --> 00:14:29,230
Here's a health check-up list.

282
00:14:29,490 --> 00:14:32,480
I'll go from number one to number ten for everyone now.

283
00:14:32,480 --> 00:14:35,080
I'll read these, and if one fits you...

284
00:14:35,080 --> 00:14:37,700
...please remember it.

285
00:14:37,700 --> 00:14:39,240
Your eyes tire easily.

286
00:14:39,240 --> 00:14:41,960
Your shoulders and back are stiff. Yours, right, Hamada?

287
00:14:42,760 --> 00:14:44,260
You tire easily.

288
00:14:44,700 --> 00:14:46,200
You have nausea.

289
00:14:46,600 --> 00:14:47,600
Your face twitches.

290
00:14:47,800 --> 00:14:49,300
You lack appetite.

291
00:14:49,660 --> 00:14:51,160
Your hands tremble.

292
00:14:51,540 --> 00:14:52,600
Your feet and hands feel cold.

293
00:14:53,800 --> 00:14:55,800
You can't think straight.

294
00:14:57,000 --> 00:14:59,760
It's "palpitations".

295
00:14:57,620 --> 00:14:59,760
Palpitations.

296
00:14:59,760 --> 00:15:01,460
You experience palpitations.

297
00:15:01,630 --> 00:15:04,970
It's obvious he just copied the text.

298
00:15:02,400 --> 00:15:04,970
He didn't read it at all!

299
00:15:06,000 --> 00:15:09,060
I had about two fit me.

300
00:15:09,060 --> 00:15:10,870
Two for me, too.

301
00:15:10,870 --> 00:15:11,760
Two.

302
00:15:11,760 --> 00:15:13,160
I have three.

303
00:15:13,320 --> 00:15:14,320
Zero to one means...

304
00:15:15,660 --> 00:15:16,320
...good health.

305
00:15:16,320 --> 00:15:19,520
We're all in the second group.

306
00:15:19,520 --> 00:15:21,160
Let's look at four to six then.

307
00:15:21,320 --> 00:15:23,000
Needs attention.

308
00:15:23,000 --> 00:15:26,300
Seven or more is very worrisome.

309
00:15:27,340 --> 00:15:29,000
Worrying about summer fatigue, right?

310
00:15:29,000 --> 00:15:31,000
Two to three is the average person.

311
00:15:32,290 --> 00:15:35,460
Well it's over now.

312
00:15:33,780 --> 00:15:35,460
What the hell, man?!

313
00:15:35,460 --> 00:15:37,050
We don't need to know more.

314
00:15:37,360 --> 00:15:39,360
When you get summer fatigue...

315
00:15:39,360 --> 00:15:41,500
...you lose your appetite and stop eating.

316
00:15:43,820 --> 00:15:46,560
The molecules that store energy...

317
00:15:46,560 --> 00:15:47,910
...do you know what they are?

318
00:15:51,160 --> 00:15:52,160
Gly...

319
00:15:53,720 --> 00:15:55,440
Glycogen!

320
00:15:55,440 --> 00:15:58,700
It forms glycogen and stores it.

321
00:15:58,700 --> 00:16:01,500
It has a deciphering effect.

322
00:15:59,590 --> 00:16:01,500
It's "detoxification"!

323
00:16:02,400 --> 00:16:03,900
Endo!

324
00:16:04,500 --> 00:16:07,590
We're not talking about encryption!

325
00:16:07,790 --> 00:16:11,440
I'm so envious of mistakes like that!

326
00:16:12,940 --> 00:16:14,800
At last, Matsumoto's presentation.

327
00:16:14,800 --> 00:16:16,830
His theme is "high blood pressure".

328
00:16:22,120 --> 00:16:28,140
I'm not going to be joking even half the time from now on.

329
00:16:30,280 --> 00:16:32,840
First, a simple problem.

330
00:16:32,840 --> 00:16:34,840
What is the connection between these?

331
00:16:35,680 --> 00:16:36,840
I've got it.

332
00:16:40,680 --> 00:16:43,680
Well, "high", of course.

333
00:16:44,860 --> 00:16:48,440
I could tell you about any one of these...

334
00:16:48,440 --> 00:16:51,820
...but today let's look at high blood pressure.

335
00:16:51,820 --> 00:16:55,620
Sooo... Tokyo University's circulatory organ clinic's...

336
00:16:55,620 --> 00:17:00,240
...diagnosis chief Yasunobu Hirata...

337
00:17:01,300 --> 00:17:03,640
...has done research about it.

338
00:17:03,640 --> 00:17:05,480
What do you think these are?

339
00:17:05,900 --> 00:17:08,800
This is the number of people affected...

340
00:17:08,800 --> 00:17:10,800
...by high blood pressure in Japan.

341
00:17:14,900 --> 00:17:17,680
35 million people.

342
00:17:21,540 --> 00:17:23,020
Only approximately, though.

343
00:17:23,020 --> 00:17:25,210
There's no point in covering that!

344
00:17:25,210 --> 00:17:27,600
Well, that's how it goes.

345
00:17:27,600 --> 00:17:30,000
What's that about the FBI?

346
00:17:30,740 --> 00:17:32,730
FBI, what the hell?

347
00:17:32,730 --> 00:17:36,620
Who decides the basis for the diagnosis of high blood pressure?

348
00:17:36,920 --> 00:17:38,920
Number one is FBI.

349
00:17:40,160 --> 00:17:42,160
Number two, PTA.

350
00:17:42,700 --> 00:17:45,160
Number three is the WHO.

351
00:17:45,160 --> 00:17:46,660
Which one is it?

352
00:17:47,900 --> 00:17:50,400
Correct.

353
00:17:53,340 --> 00:17:57,220
We know it can't be the PTA or FBI.

354
00:17:55,740 --> 00:17:57,220
I know, right?

355
00:17:57,400 --> 00:17:59,000
Isn't this the end, then?

356
00:17:59,000 --> 00:18:00,900
We don't need this any more.

357
00:18:01,100 --> 00:18:02,900
If you put the same amount of water through...

358
00:18:02,900 --> 00:18:04,900
...a stiff, narrow hose - compared to...

359
00:18:04,900 --> 00:18:06,900
...an elastic, thick hose, the narrow hose...

360
00:18:06,900 --> 00:18:09,040
...spews water with a higher force.

361
00:18:09,940 --> 00:18:11,220
This is the principle.

362
00:18:11,220 --> 00:18:15,080
The more narrow it is, the higher the pressure gets.

363
00:18:15,280 --> 00:18:17,080
This is what it looks like.

364
00:18:18,740 --> 00:18:22,660
I've explained it in simple terms with a rubber hose.

365
00:18:22,660 --> 00:18:26,000
It can also be shown with jeans.  Same thing.

366
00:18:30,720 --> 00:18:32,340
So you really have to be careful.

367
00:18:35,520 --> 00:18:37,600
This is what it's about.

368
00:18:36,120 --> 00:18:37,600
That's a lot of text.

369
00:18:37,600 --> 00:18:41,140
Internal secretions regulate the blood pressure...

370
00:18:41,140 --> 00:18:45,320
...through autonomic nerves.

371
00:18:45,320 --> 00:18:46,980
This is how they're related to each other.

372
00:18:46,980 --> 00:18:52,420
If you just look at this, you'll pretty much understand everything.

373
00:18:52,420 --> 00:18:55,300
Various things result in high blood pressure.

374
00:18:55,300 --> 00:18:56,560
Get this through your thick heads.

375
00:18:57,060 --> 00:18:59,220
Could you explain it a bit further?

376
00:18:59,420 --> 00:19:03,080
If we think about it in terms of Yoshimoto comedians...

377
00:18:59,420 --> 00:19:03,080
T/N: Yoshimoto is the agency that Downtown, Hosei, and Cocorico work for.

378
00:19:04,860 --> 00:19:06,860
I'll name it the difference between rich and poor people.

379
00:19:08,620 --> 00:19:10,510
Well, they resemble each other.

380
00:19:10,860 --> 00:19:12,860
Think about that.

381
00:19:13,410 --> 00:19:16,850
You can't show it too long.

382
00:19:17,300 --> 00:19:19,200
It disappeared so quickly.

383
00:19:19,560 --> 00:19:21,360
That's about it.

384
00:19:21,360 --> 00:19:25,540
I don't have anything else to tell you.

385
00:19:31,940 --> 00:19:33,460
What is... this solemn feeling?

386
00:19:33,460 --> 00:19:36,020
What is... this solemn feeling?

387
00:19:40,860 --> 00:19:44,820
Hamada finishes up with aging prevention.

388
00:19:50,660 --> 00:19:52,040
Good evening.

389
00:19:52,480 --> 00:19:54,240
My subject is "aging prevention".

390
00:19:54,780 --> 00:19:56,580
We're all steadily aging.

391
00:19:56,580 --> 00:19:58,480
I'm sure we all relate here.

392
00:19:58,480 --> 00:20:01,120
We are all getting older.

393
00:20:01,720 --> 00:20:03,720
First up - what is aging?

394
00:20:07,520 --> 00:20:11,480
He's aged so much he can't insert the flipcard properly.

395
00:20:14,600 --> 00:20:17,500
This is aging. Read it out loud.

396
00:20:20,000 --> 00:20:24,560
Along with aging, internal organs' functions gradually deteriorate.

397
00:20:24,560 --> 00:20:28,200
Eventually you become unable to cope with your surroundings.

398
00:20:28,420 --> 00:20:34,400
It's a process that leads to death, and it advances all the time...

399
00:20:34,400 --> 00:20:35,700
...being irreversible.

400
00:20:36,000 --> 00:20:39,300
That's difficult.

401
00:20:36,980 --> 00:20:39,300
Isn't it?

402
00:20:40,300 --> 00:20:41,720
So, everyone...

403
00:20:41,720 --> 00:20:45,880
When does aging really start?

404
00:20:45,880 --> 00:20:48,240
Let's guess.

405
00:20:48,520 --> 00:20:50,240
One by one.  Tell me.

406
00:20:52,580 --> 00:20:54,920
When does aging start?

407
00:20:55,120 --> 00:20:57,540
Teacher, excuse me?

408
00:20:56,660 --> 00:20:57,540
What?

409
00:20:57,540 --> 00:20:59,540
It's hard for me to think like this.

410
00:21:00,620 --> 00:21:01,540
When you're 40!

411
00:21:01,540 --> 00:21:02,450
40, ok.

412
00:21:02,450 --> 00:21:04,140
It's aging, so I'll say 50.

413
00:21:04,140 --> 00:21:05,880
50? OK.

414
00:21:05,880 --> 00:21:07,840
I think 20.

415
00:21:07,840 --> 00:21:09,760
I also think it's pretty early...

416
00:21:09,760 --> 00:21:11,540
...so I'll take the middle ground and say 30.

417
00:21:11,900 --> 00:21:14,870
One of you got it right.  It starts at the age of 20.

418
00:21:15,000 --> 00:21:17,820
Yes, from the age of 20, aging has begun.

419
00:21:17,820 --> 00:21:21,580
What is the phenomenon of aging?  Let's take a look.

420
00:21:22,000 --> 00:21:23,580
Aging is...

421
00:21:28,400 --> 00:21:29,400
That's creepy!

422
00:21:30,120 --> 00:21:32,400
It's like that guy from Dengeki Network.

423
00:21:30,120 --> 00:21:34,400
T/N: Dengeki Network was a group of four men who were known for performing dangerous stunts.  They were popular in the 1990s.

424
00:21:32,420 --> 00:21:36,940
Dengeki Network

425
00:21:32,420 --> 00:21:36,940
Nanbu Torata

426
00:21:32,900 --> 00:21:34,400
Mr. Nanbu!

427
00:21:36,940 --> 00:21:40,480
Dementia, cataracts, diabetes...

428
00:21:40,480 --> 00:21:43,040
...bones and muscles deteriorate, balding and gray hair...

429
00:21:43,040 --> 00:21:46,000
...wrinkles, high blood pressure like we had earlier...

430
00:21:46,000 --> 00:21:48,920
...and the decline of reproductive functions.

431
00:21:48,920 --> 00:21:50,730
This is what aging is all about.

432
00:21:51,380 --> 00:21:53,440
His pace is quite fast.

433
00:21:52,600 --> 00:21:53,440
Indeed.

434
00:21:53,440 --> 00:21:56,820
After middle age, what are the abilities that get better...

435
00:21:56,820 --> 00:21:58,760
...and the ones that get worse?

436
00:21:59,960 --> 00:22:02,200
There are abilities that actually improve?

437
00:22:02,200 --> 00:22:03,260
Yes, there are.

438
00:22:03,260 --> 00:22:07,110
Memory improves with age, right?

439
00:22:07,110 --> 00:22:09,600
These are the abilities that improve.

440
00:22:09,600 --> 00:22:13,600
Imagination, analysis, judgement and thinking.

441
00:22:12,760 --> 00:22:13,600
I see.

442
00:22:14,550 --> 00:22:15,840
They're all intellect-based.

443
00:22:15,840 --> 00:22:18,440
When you get older, these actually go up.

444
00:22:18,720 --> 00:22:20,790
Things like learning ability.

445
00:22:21,480 --> 00:22:23,460
There are the abilities that deteriorate.

446
00:22:24,360 --> 00:22:27,770
Memorization, long-term memory and concentration.

447
00:22:28,260 --> 00:22:29,740
They deteriorate.

448
00:22:30,720 --> 00:22:33,540
However, even if you become unable to...

449
00:22:33,540 --> 00:22:35,760
...do tricky calculations in your head...

450
00:22:35,760 --> 00:22:37,940
...you can still live a good life...

451
00:22:37,940 --> 00:22:39,780
...as long as you have good judgment.

452
00:22:39,780 --> 00:22:41,520
It doesn't matter if some abilities deteriorate.

453
00:22:41,520 --> 00:22:44,900
That's what the proverb "the older, the wiser" means.

454
00:22:46,900 --> 00:22:50,530
Why did you write that in brown?

455
00:22:51,800 --> 00:22:54,500
For the sake of the atmosphere.

456
00:22:52,740 --> 00:22:54,500
Out of all the colors you chose that.

457
00:22:59,560 --> 00:23:03,320
Bones and muscles deteriorate.  Let's concentrate on this.

458
00:23:03,780 --> 00:23:06,760
How old are you in terms of elasticity?

459
00:23:08,080 --> 00:23:11,760
If you're in your 20s, you should be able to do this.

460
00:23:14,330 --> 00:23:15,600
Creepy!

461
00:23:15,600 --> 00:23:17,600
Both your hands can touch the floor...

462
00:23:17,600 --> 00:23:20,200
...and your face can reach your knees.

463
00:23:20,660 --> 00:23:24,080
The arms and legs are way out of proportion!

464
00:23:24,740 --> 00:23:27,700
In your 40s the tips of your fingers reach the floor.

465
00:23:31,020 --> 00:23:32,760
Lastly, in your 50s...

466
00:23:35,500 --> 00:23:39,780
...your fingers are further than 20 cm from the ground.

467
00:23:38,060 --> 00:23:39,780
I'm probably in the 50s.

468
00:23:39,780 --> 00:23:42,620
The man in the illustration is moving further from the foreground.

469
00:23:44,740 --> 00:23:49,240
If you think about your elasticity, how old would you be?

470
00:23:49,360 --> 00:23:52,740
I don't have any confidence!

471
00:23:50,660 --> 00:23:52,740
Me too, I can't do it.

472
00:23:52,740 --> 00:23:54,940
So everyone is in this group?

473
00:23:54,940 --> 00:23:56,440
Your fingers can't reach the floor?

474
00:23:57,060 --> 00:23:59,360
Oh, mine somehow reaches the floor.

475
00:23:58,300 --> 00:23:59,360
Are you serious?

476
00:23:59,360 --> 00:24:01,360
I can't do it.

477
00:24:01,840 --> 00:24:04,150
We're all in our 50s!

478
00:24:04,150 --> 00:24:06,120
It's no good.

479
00:24:07,380 --> 00:24:08,900
So, aging is...

480
00:24:08,900 --> 00:24:11,020
We don't need that!

481
00:24:12,140 --> 00:24:13,140
It's scary!

482
00:24:13,860 --> 00:24:16,420
Let's go back to this.

483
00:24:16,420 --> 00:24:19,660
We talked about this, right?

484
00:24:17,180 --> 00:24:19,660
This is like the main menu of a video game.
