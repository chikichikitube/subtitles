00:00:04,160 --> 00:00:09,160
A legendary batsu game was going to happen...

6
00:00:09,160 --> 00:00:15,980
A school where you shouldn't laugh.

7
00:00:16,040 --> 00:00:20,500
The 4 men who will participate in this batsu game are...

8

Hamada Masatoshi

19
00:00:58,740 --> 00:01:00,620
School life,

20
00:01:00,620 --> 00:01:03,460
it was laughter and hope in everyday life,

21
00:01:03,460 --> 00:01:07,520
memories that you keep forever in your heart.

22
00:01:08,140 --> 00:01:13,920
But this school was a place where laughter is punished...

23
00:01:14,860 --> 00:01:21,140
A school where a small smile is enough to be beaten...

24
00:01:22,300 --> 00:01:27,720
In addition, this school has many traps...

25
00:01:27,720 --> 00:01:32,790
This place is hell on earth.

26
00:01:33,140 --> 00:01:36,790
It all started with this event...

27
00:01:36,960 --> 00:01:39,420
"Gaki no tsukai ya arahende!!" Introduce you

28
00:01:39,420 --> 00:01:46,040
"Electrical outlets Russian roulette" challenge!!

29
00:01:50,580 --> 00:01:56,200
Out of 100 electrical outlets, there are 4 in which the current flows.

30
00:01:56,200 --> 00:02:00,540
The game will be held until the elimination of one of the Downtown member.

31
00:02:00,540 --> 00:02:05,280
They can only count on their luck!

32
00:02:06,580 --> 00:02:11,220
The first man to receive his ticket for the batsu game is...

33
00:02:12,500 --> 00:02:14,560
This one should be fine...

34
00:02:14,560 --> 00:02:17,160
Will it be okay?

35
00:02:17,160 --> 00:02:19,220
This one is very height.

36
00:02:19,940 --> 00:02:21,140
The light has changed, right?

37
00:02:22,560 --> 00:02:24,520
Yes, the light has changed!

38
00:02:24,520 --> 00:02:26,520
With that, we can have suspicions!

39
00:02:26,520 --> 00:02:30,620
You can see how lousy
the electrical installation is in this studio!

40
00:02:30,620 --> 00:02:31,650
It's not good!

41
00:02:31,080 --> 00:02:34,620
You're saying nonsense, It's not that !

42
00:02:34,620 --> 00:02:35,940
I'm going for it!

43
00:02:39,310 --> 00:02:41,200
I don't feel it! I don't feel it!

44
00:02:41,600 --> 00:02:42,850
Come on!

45
00:02:48,220 --> 00:02:49,370

00:03:28,170 --> 00:03:31,370
Who will be the third victim?

52
00:03:31,370 --> 00:03:32,170
I'm going!

53
00:03:37,600 --> 00:03:40,510

Tanaka Naoki participates in the batsu game!

55
00:03:48,740 --> 00:03:52,050
And finally, the last man...

56
00:03:52,510 --> 00:03:53,770
I choose number 64!

57
00:04:01,250 --> 00:04:04,740
Wow, I never thought it would be like this!

58
00:04:04,090 --> 00:04:04,090
Are you OK?

59
00:04:04,090 --> 00:04:04,090
Keep yourself together, Watanabe!

60
00:04:04,090 --> 00:04:04,090
Watanabe! Are you all right?

61
00:04:07,940 --> 00:04:09,140
I'm going!

62
00:04:16,850 --> 00:04:19,650
What? What?

63
00:04:19,650 --> 00:04:21,650
Stop that! It hurts too much!

64
00:04:25,820 --> 00:04:30,340
The last one is Matsumoto Hitoshi!

65
00:04:30,400 --> 00:04:35,880

75
00:05:06,630 --> 00:05:10,200
I really think we should stop doing these types of Batsu Games.

76
00:05:10,200 --> 00:05:10,880
Oh really?

77
00:05:10,880 --> 00:05:13,530
and it probably makes you angry when I say that but...

78
00:05:13,530 --> 00:05:15,810
but we haven't been able to sleep!

79
00:05:16,360 --> 00:05:17,370
After you went home did you go to sleep?

80
00:05:17,370 --> 00:05:20,150
Its like we are so wound up we can't sleep!

81
00:05:20,530 --> 00:05:22,530
after we received all those punishments

82
00:05:22,580 --> 00:05:25,630
and everytime I'm about to doze off I hear - "Matsumoto- OUT!!"

83
00:05:26,910 --> 00:05:32,530
Tochigi Prefecture, Nasu Shiobara

84
00:05:28,460 --> 00:05:31,740
This time the stage for the Batsu Game is in a place famous for it's Hot Springs

Nasu Shiobara in Tochigi prefecture.

86
00:05:33,920 --> 00:05:38,170
Surrounded by nature, this green paradise is to 4 people...

87
00:05:38,180 --> 00:05:39,970
Hell on earth.

88
00:05:41,190 --> 00:05:47,830

89
00:05:41,190 --> 00:05:47,830
Day of the Batsu Game

90
00:05:42,900 --> 00:05:44,730
On the day of the Batsu Game

91
00:05:44,980 --> 00:05:49,730
because of an incoming typhoon there was heavy rain in the morning.

92
00:05:45,930 --> 00:05:48,730
Wow, the weather's horrible.

93
00:05:49,930 --> 00:05:53,430
Yeah, it even affects how you feel..
affects tension too.

94
00:05:54,720 --> 00:06:04,120
8:45 a.m.

95
00:05:54,750 --> 00:05:58,620
Then at 8:45 am, the rain got lighter

96
00:05:59,540 --> 00:06:04,210
The bus carrying the 4 losers arrives at the school.

97
00:06:07,420 --> 00:06:10,620
The person waiting for them there is, of course, this guy

98
00:06:10,520 --> 00:06:12,220
You're wearing the same clothing as then!

99
00:06:11,900 --> 00:06:15,620

00:06:17,660 --> 00:06:19,780
He's So ugly!

106
00:06:19,320 --> 00:06:22,000
This way! Over Here!

107
00:06:22,120 --> 00:06:27,120
Welcome to Kuchiburu... I mean, West Kuchibiru High School,

108
00:06:28,320 --> 00:06:31,120
It's a funny name right, Matsumoto?

109
00:06:30,540 --> 00:06:32,820
The school name is in honor of Hamada

110
00:06:30,720 --> 00:06:32,820
Kuchibiru = 'Lips'

111
00:06:31,540 --> 00:06:32,820
West Kuchibiru Private High School

112
00:06:32,020 --> 00:06:34,060
When it (the batsu game) starts, can you take your wedding ring off?

113
00:06:34,060 --> 00:06:35,860
When it (the batsu game) starts, can you take your wedding ring off?

114
00:06:35,040 --> 00:06:35,040
We'll start with you, get going.

115
00:06:35,860 --> 00:06:38,520
That way I think I won't laugh as much.

116
00:06:37,730 --> 00:06:39,730
That's mean..

117
00:06:39,030 --> 00:06:40,120
Look at it!

118
00:06:40,120 --> 00:06:43,620
More importantly, you guys are entering school now, whats with those clothes?

119
00:06:43,620 --> 00:06:46,620
I have your uniforms in the car.

120
00:06:46,940 --> 00:06:48,180
So change right away.

121
00:06:48,420 --> 00:07:00,660
Changing Clothes

122
00:06:48,780 --> 00:06:50,660

00:06:50,660 --> 00:06:55,180
<Matsumoto> Whats so funny?

124
00:06:52,660 --> 00:06:55,120
<Yamasaki> I've already found the first trap

125
00:06:55,180 --> 00:06:56,980
<Matsumoto> Wha...

126
00:06:56,980 --> 00:07:00,660
<Matsumoto:That's not fair. You'll have an advantage.

127
00:06:58,660 --> 00:07:00,660
<Yamasaki> Yeah, I guess I will

128
00:07:02,660 --> 00:07:04,120
Are you guys about done?

129
00:07:04,120 --> 00:07:05,620

Yeah

133
00:07:05,620 --> 00:07:09,140
When you... (cough) are ready, could you come out here?

134
00:07:08,530 --> 00:07:11,910
He sounded like he had
something stuck in his throat

135
00:07:21,340 --> 00:07:24,940
When Fujiwara sees Yamasaki's uniform, he can't stop laughing

136
00:07:22,120 --> 00:07:25,520
Other stu-(laughs) students are..(laughs)

137
00:07:28,300 --> 00:07:36,120
Yamasaki, the school rules...(laughs) you're almost breaking them.

138
00:07:29,430 --> 00:07:30,700
That's unfair right?

139
00:07:30,700 --> 00:07:31,720
I know, right!

140
00:07:40,120 --> 00:07:42,520

I think I'll have you guys tell me what you think.

173
00:08:55,630 --> 00:08:57,330
Yamasaki, you first.

174
00:08:57,330 --> 00:09:01,010
It's not shabby at all.  With a gym and...

175
00:09:02,910 --> 00:09:03,750

176
00:09:03,750 --> 00:09:04,770

177
00:09:04,820 --> 00:09:06,530

178
00:09:06,650 --> 00:09:07,630
Ah!

179
00:09:10,740 --> 00:09:15,300
A middle-aged school girl arrives at the school

180
00:09:12,900 --> 00:09:13,260
Good morning!

183
00:09:19,190 --> 00:09:21,830
She's really something

184
00:09:23,820 --> 00:09:26,160
That's Kuchibiru West High's Madonna

185
00:09:26,800 --> 00:09:30,760
Don't even think... about asking her out.

186
00:09:31,390 --> 00:09:33,190
He always stumbles

187
00:09:31,690 --> 00:09:35,210
(laughs)..Shall we go?

188
00:09:36,000 --> 00:09:37,610
He just laughed!

189
00:09:38,680 --> 00:09:40,070
You!

190
00:09:40,070 --> 00:09:42,070
It was a nice first laugh.

191
00:09:42,070 --> 00:09:43,750
Was it Yamasaki?

192
00:09:47,700 --> 00:09:52,620
If you laugh, other school students smack you with a bamboo sword (Shinai)

193
00:09:47,760 --> 00:09:49,930
This the punishment?! Are you serious!

194
00:09:49,990 --> 00:09:52,300
That's definitely gonna hurt.

195
00:09:52,800 --> 00:09:53,980
It hurts, doesn't it?

196
00:09:53,520 --> 00:09:55,430
Yeah!, It really hurts!

197
00:09:56,700 --> 00:09:58,410
Much more than that whip from last time

198
00:09:58,410 --> 00:09:59,790
Ouch!

199
00:09:59,790 --> 00:10:03,180
Sensei Please,

200
00:10:01,040 --> 00:10:03,440
Seriously, no more studdering. Please.

201
00:10:03,380 --> 00:10:04,620
We're going.

202
00:10:04,280 --> 00:10:07,630
Ahh, this is going to hurt.

203
00:10:07,630 --> 00:10:10,610
It will seriously damage my behind if I get lots of them.

204
00:10:12,260 --> 00:10:14,540
Come on, hurry up!

205
00:10:18,140 --> 00:10:22,300
(musician)

206
00:10:18,140 --> 00:10:22,300
Monsieur Kamayatsu

207
00:10:22,260 --> 00:10:23,970
Something like that...

208
00:10:35,330 --> 00:10:40,140
Kamayatsu, you aren't giving your all these days.

209
00:10:41,300 --> 00:10:43,140
Wait a minute!

210
00:10:43,900 --> 00:10:48,300
You may not know this, but his father was struck by illness.

211
00:10:48,300 --> 00:10:51,940
So he's working as a paper boy in the morning.

212
00:10:51,940 --> 00:10:54,140
Is that true, Kamayatsu?

213
00:10:54,140 --> 00:10:54,740
Yeah..

214
00:10:55,020 --> 00:10:57,110
Do you want to?

215
00:11:00,260 --> 00:11:02,170
It's funny because I can't hear anything they're saying because of the wind.

216
00:11:03,530 --> 00:11:05,030
It's blowing too hard.

217
00:11:05,000 --> 00:11:06,170
Oooooouch!

218
00:11:06,560 --> 00:11:07,690
That's gotta hurt

219
00:11:07,550 --> 00:11:08,470
It hurts!

220
00:11:08,540 --> 00:11:12,200
Kamayatsu, we've gotta practice for the next competition.

221
00:11:14,490 --> 00:11:16,540
Its wrong for him to be on the team.

222
00:11:16,820 --> 00:11:19,170
What are you doing Kamayatsu! Catch it!

223
00:11:22,220 --> 00:11:25,620
(The ball hit him right in the in the face)

224
00:11:22,700 --> 00:11:24,660
It was right in the face.

225
00:11:25,420 --> 00:11:27,270
No wonder we all laughed.

226
00:11:29,640 --> 00:11:32,930
That's not fair.

227
00:11:43,580 --> 00:11:46,140
Catch the F'ing Ball Kamayatsu!

228
00:11:45,400 --> 00:11:47,740
They did it again and again.

229
00:11:47,740 --> 00:11:50,170
Stop this. Please!

230
00:11:50,170 --> 00:11:52,370
Don't do it again.

231
00:12:00,540 --> 00:12:02,430
Kamayatsu, we run next.

232
00:12:02,430 --> 00:12:04,340
Go fast Kamayatsu!

233
00:12:04,340 --> 00:12:05,750
Run!

234
00:12:06,140 --> 00:12:07,090
Kamayatsu-kun

235
00:12:08,500 --> 00:12:09,310
Faster, Kamayatsu. Kamayatsu--!!

236
00:12:11,890 --> 00:12:13,500
Ah, The bloom of youth.

237
00:12:14,230 --> 00:12:16,190
Aren't sports great?

238
00:12:17,470 --> 00:12:19,140
Don't do that again, please

239
00:12:19,140 --> 00:12:21,460
He dropped the ball so many times

240
00:12:21,460 --> 00:12:23,460
There has to be no more of that

241
00:12:22,730 --> 00:12:24,410
My thigh really hurts!

242
00:12:24,410 --> 00:12:26,140
Yeah, mine too.

243
00:12:26,140 --> 00:12:28,140
The one you got looked painful.

244
00:12:28,540 --> 00:12:30,770
Man there's a lot, of these skits

245
00:12:31,690 --> 00:12:34,120
How bad is he?

246
00:12:34,120 --> 00:12:36,120
Is he okay!?

247
00:12:37,580 --> 00:12:38,620
Nu..Nukumizu

248
00:12:38,620 --> 00:12:40,860
Nu..Nukumizu

249
00:12:42,260 --> 00:12:45,620
Ace of the team who is cooling his shoulder

250
00:12:42,260 --> 00:12:45,620
Nukumizu (actor)

251
00:12:44,740 --> 00:12:46,940
Nukumizu, how's your shoulder?

252
00:12:46,940 --> 00:12:48,940
I can't really say right now

253
00:12:48,940 --> 00:12:50,820
You pitch too much!

254
00:12:50,820 --> 00:12:54,260
I'm sorry, I'll do the best I can

255
00:12:55,260 --> 00:12:58,420
All right.  We continue practicing for the national tournament.

256
00:12:58,470 --> 00:12:59,600
Yeah!

257
00:13:03,500 --> 00:13:04,340
Look at him

258
00:13:05,500 --> 00:13:07,690
Look at the way he walks

259
00:13:09,170 --> 00:13:11,100
There ya go,  that's a good throw huh?

260
00:13:11,890 --> 00:13:13,070
What?!

261
00:13:17,380 --> 00:13:19,430
That was safe!

262
00:13:22,670 --> 00:13:24,810
Ahh! My back!

263
00:13:24,810 --> 00:13:26,810
That one really hurt!

264
00:13:27,700 --> 00:13:30,710
Nukumizu is in no shape to play any sport

265
00:13:28,020 --> 00:13:30,140
This is impossible when you see that.

266
00:13:31,670 --> 00:13:34,730
He will never make it to the national tournament

267
00:13:35,800 --> 00:13:38,140
It has just started, But we're already...

268
00:13:38,140 --> 00:13:40,140
It's very fast paced, its intense!

269
00:13:39,210 --> 00:13:40,310
Yeah it is

270
00:13:41,060 --> 00:13:42,390
Here's the shoe lockers

271
00:13:42,390 --> 00:13:44,220
There's a locker with your names on it for each of you.

272
00:13:44,130 --> 00:13:47,890
So open it and change..uh.. your shoes.

273
00:13:51,100 --> 00:13:52,430
this is kind of scary,

274
00:13:52,570 --> 00:13:55,230
Ah, its OK.

275
00:13:55,500 --> 00:13:57,570
Tanaka's indoor shoes

276
00:13:57,060 --> 00:13:58,180
I don't like this...

277
00:13:58,390 --> 00:14:00,180
Ah, mine are perfectly fine too

278
00:14:00,060 --> 00:14:01,440
Endo's indoor shoes

279
00:14:05,870 --> 00:14:07,550
Oh, Good.

280
00:14:06,980 --> 00:14:08,100
Matsumoto's indoor shoes

281
00:14:08,940 --> 00:14:11,220
Its fine, There's no problem.

282
00:14:16,890 --> 00:14:18,920
Didn't you laugh just now?

283
00:14:19,550 --> 00:14:21,170
They're filthy

284
00:14:20,220 --> 00:14:23,780
Yamasaki's shoes

285
00:14:23,890 --> 00:14:25,340
Those are filthy

286
00:14:24,960 --> 00:14:27,420
Yeah really dirty.

287
00:14:26,740 --> 00:14:29,980
Matsumoto notices something and starts laughing

288
00:14:27,420 --> 00:14:29,300
And they're a little too small

289
00:14:41,300 --> 00:14:43,290
No no no! I didn't laugh at your shoes

290
00:14:44,330 --> 00:14:45,490
Look

291
00:14:44,770 --> 00:14:47,260
(Gum)

292
00:14:50,060 --> 00:14:52,370
I couldn't keep the chewing gum to myself

293
00:14:59,950 --> 00:15:04,120
Ow!  My thigh hurts.

294
00:15:04,320 --> 00:15:06,890
I thought this was the only trap

295
00:15:06,050 --> 00:15:07,810
Yeah, kind of a decoy

296
00:15:11,310 --> 00:15:15,680
"BunBuRyouDou" is a saying meaning = Both Literary and Military Arts--Smart and Athletic

297
00:15:11,310 --> 00:15:15,680
At this school, "the pen and the sword" is our motto.

298
00:15:16,550 --> 00:15:19,500
even the sports teams are very successful.

299
00:15:21,140 --> 00:15:23,780
These are the Baseball club's...

300
00:15:22,210 --> 00:15:23,890
They are runner-up in the national tournament.

301
00:15:24,470 --> 00:15:25,600
Wow, that's amazing!

302
00:15:25,600 --> 00:15:28,870
The softball team also came 2nd. The soccer, 3rd.

303
00:15:29,490 --> 00:15:29,490
He's too good

304
00:15:29,490 --> 00:15:29,490
Who wouldn't laugh at that

305
00:15:29,560 --> 00:15:31,290
And these are the amateur wrestling team's...

306
00:15:31,410 --> 00:15:33,230
They're the national champion.

307
00:15:33,230 --> 00:15:35,230
Here's a picture of the team.

308
00:15:35,460 --> 00:15:47,030
Chief Producer Suga

309
00:15:41,530 --> 00:15:43,700
Suga-san is my weakness!

310
00:15:42,830 --> 00:15:46,940
It's hopeless, Suga-san gets me every time.

311
00:15:43,700 --> 00:15:45,700
Yeah, me too.

312
00:15:50,930 --> 00:15:52,840
Here's the article from when they won.

313

(He's Strong, Too Strong! Super High School Kid Wrestler Suga-kun)

314
00:16:00,820 --> 00:16:02,810
did you see that picture?

315
00:16:03,900 --> 00:16:07,920
(Endo hid his face and luckily escaped the punishment.)

316
00:16:04,170 --> 00:16:07,730
There are way too many traps.

317
00:16:08,250 --> 00:16:12,100
Suga-kun is the hero of our school.

318
00:16:12,340 --> 00:16:14,670
He's face is intense! This pictures incredible.

319
00:16:16,980 --> 00:16:18,860
This isn't good.

320
00:16:19,670 --> 00:16:22,530
Wait! I didn't laugh!

321
00:16:28,060 --> 00:16:29,300
This way.

322
00:16:30,600 --> 00:16:34,800
I can't lower my guard, this is rough.

323
00:16:36,990 --> 00:16:38,240
Here

324
00:16:38,730 --> 00:16:40,120
This is our class?

Their Classroom   3 nen(year) B gumi(class)

326

This is your classroom. Your desk has your name written on it, so please find it.

(Blue Sky MC Blue Sky)

329
00:16:47,490 --> 00:16:49,660
They thought we'd find this funny?

330
00:16:47,780 --> 00:16:49,250
Wait here.

331
00:16:47,870 --> 00:16:49,640
(Blue Sky My Sweet Helen Blue Sky)

332
00:16:49,660 --> 00:16:51,540
I don't know what they were thinking

333
00:16:51,480 --> 00:16:53,910
The four of them finally arrived at the classroom

334
00:16:53,910 --> 00:16:58,880
The fact that recieved so many punishments in so little time makes them uneasy.

335
00:16:58,880 --> 00:17:01,800
I understand why you laughed at that, Endo.

336
00:17:01,980 --> 00:17:04,350
The wind completely drowned out their voices

Football Star
Monsieur Kamaytsu

338
00:17:04,350 --> 00:17:06,350
That was really hard, honestly.

339
00:17:07,640 --> 00:17:08,950
That wasn't right.

340
00:17:11,640 --> 00:17:13,430
The guy with the tuque...

Isn't my belt too short?

343
00:17:27,620 --> 00:17:39,120
Just barely

344
00:17:32,280 --> 00:17:33,180
He laughed.

345
00:17:33,180 --> 00:17:34,100
He did.

346
00:17:36,190 --> 00:17:38,500
Tanaka was out too.

347
00:17:38,470 --> 00:17:40,780
You didn't have to tell us

348
00:17:39,310 --> 00:17:42,030
Why did you tell us?

349
00:17:42,490 --> 00:17:44,050
Here comes the boss

350
00:17:52,470 --> 00:17:54,090
He remembered you, Tanaka

*Kakushinhan - Is the japanese noun for the type of crime that somebody commits believes that their actions are right based on religous or political beliefs. In a legal terms its a "crime of conscience"

Okay?

353

Really, I am

355
00:17:56,460 --> 00:17:59,610
I'm no good, this punishment doesn't suit me

356
00:17:59,520 --> 00:18:01,830
don't say it "doesn't suit me"

357

This happens a lot doesn't it.

358

It's just Friendly Fire right

359
00:18:11,120 --> 00:18:14,440
Yeah, like a stray 'one word' bullet

360
00:18:13,230 --> 00:18:14,670
Right right right.

361
00:18:15,600 --> 00:18:20,250
There's no such thing as a punishment that "doesn't suit you" or "suits you"

369
00:18:33,820 --> 00:18:35,940
,My bicycle had a flat tire.

370
00:18:35,940 --> 00:18:37,540

00:18:54,220 --> 00:18:55,500
,slap

378
00:18:55,810 --> 00:18:57,960

379
00:18:58,610 --> 00:19:00,590

,You little... come with me!

384
00:19:12,470 --> 00:19:14,360
,He was so cruel to such a kind boy

385
00:19:20,630 --> 00:19:24,040
,There's no way we couldn't laugh,
Such a kind boy.

386
00:19:25,370 --> 00:19:26,670
,He was ripping into him

387
00:19:26,610 --> 00:19:29,280
,He was beating the crap out of him.

388
00:19:29,370 --> 00:19:31,490
,Anybody would laugh at that!

389
00:19:33,180 --> 00:19:35,230
,Had enough of Suga too

390
00:19:40,140 --> 00:19:43,640

391
00:19:49,520 --> 00:19:52,370
,You guys are late. Quick, get in line.

392
00:19:55,070 --> 00:19:57,400
,There's a teacher with an Afro

393

,*He keeps using 'lip' instead of 'mouth'

399
00:20:22,490 --> 00:20:27,160
,The other day, triggered by a bad 'lip'...

400
00:20:27,160 --> 00:20:30,040
,some students in this school got into a fight with students from another school.

401
00:20:30,520 --> 00:20:34,160
,It has even become trouble for the police.

402
00:20:35,290 --> 00:20:38,700
,I've told you all..

403
00:20:40,200 --> 00:20:43,490
,"Before resorting to violence let your 'lips' do the talking" many times before.

404
00:20:43,590 --> 00:20:48,520
,I've 'lipped' this to you over and over. As the saying goes:

405
00:20:49,080 --> 00:20:55,730
"Don't let your 'lip' get you into trouble".

406
00:20:56,580 --> 00:21:01,130
Take that to heart, and act responsibly

407
00:21:02,120 --> 00:21:04,070

00:21:43,620 --> 00:21:48,500

425
00:22:24,400 --> 00:22:26,720
Some one broke their bamboo sword.

426
00:22:29,140 --> 00:22:33,210
Eh.. I'm going to teach at West 'Lip' High starting this semester,

427

00:23:10,480 --> 00:23:13,790
I... eh... before becoming a teacher,

433
00:23:13,790 --> 00:23:17,090
i was in charge of lighting in a strip club.

434
00:23:29,100 --> 00:23:35,540
Note: Heipo really worked as a lighting designer in a strip club when he was in his twenties.

435
00:23:35,040 --> 00:23:37,220
Thank you, Mr. Omame

436
00:23:40,010 --> 00:23:43,770
(A Black student starts to wobble.)

437
00:23:49,810 --> 00:23:50,800
Are you all right?

438
00:23:51,660 --> 00:23:54,240
Watanabe, are you OK?

439
00:24:00,250 --> 00:24:01,320
Watanabe

440
00:24:01,260 --> 00:24:02,540
Are you ok?

441
00:24:03,780 --> 00:24:07,860
(He's speaking a local dialect)

442
00:24:03,920 --> 00:24:07,600
My he...head is spinning...

443
00:24:08,610 --> 00:24:09,650
Keep yourself together, Watanabe!

444
00:24:09,770 --> 00:24:10,260
Keep yourself together, Watanabe!

445
00:24:10,460 --> 00:24:14,970
Keep yourself together, Watanabe!

446
00:24:15,000 --> 00:24:19,190
I advise everyone to be careful of anemia (not enough blood making it to the brain because of poor circulation)

447
00:24:19,860 --> 00:24:25,090
Next, we sing the school song together.

448
00:24:20,870 --> 00:24:24,250
(Everbody Safe)

449
00:24:27,400 --> 00:24:33,590
West Kuchibiru High School's school song

450
00:24:29,000 --> 00:24:32,440
(They even made a school song?)

451
00:24:33,910 --> 00:24:41,050
That girl has the things that make me fall in love

452
00:24:39,900 --> 00:24:41,600
What kind of lyrics are those?!

453
00:24:41,780 --> 00:24:49,790
They rise from her mouth like Mt. Fuji

454
00:24:49,930 --> 00:24:57,160
Plump, soft, and glossy

455
00:24:58,060 --> 00:25:05,400
Two nutured red shells

456
00:25:05,690 --> 00:25:13,610
Aaa 'Lips', 'Lips' West High School

457
00:25:11,940 --> 00:25:15,060
(You were laughing hard)

458
00:25:38,510 --> 00:25:38,970
Wha---?

459
00:25:47,100 --> 00:25:50,140
(This time, tons of hard bread)

460
00:25:59,040 --> 00:26:00,460
(that was definitely out, Tanaka)

461
00:26:00,520 --> 00:26:03,000
That's a lot (of bread)

462
00:26:03,180 --> 00:26:05,690
(They always set up traps on Yamasaki)

463
00:26:05,780 --> 00:26:06,620
(They do)

464
00:26:07,140 --> 00:26:08,990
(Its not fair.)

465
00:26:09,190 --> 00:26:10,410
(Like an inside man?)

466
00:26:10,490 --> 00:26:15,930
Hou-san (Yamasaki), Do you mind, from my angle...

467
00:26:16,360 --> 00:26:19,280
..the bread (in the desk) is...

468
00:26:19,370 --> 00:26:20,530
I can see it!

469
00:26:26,400 --> 00:26:28,450
Come on, its in sight

470
00:26:28,540 --> 00:26:30,210

00:27:33,860 --> 00:27:35,360
,Eh! You again!?

491
00:27:35,940 --> 00:27:40,250
,(We saw him when he came in. Still, it was funny.)

492
00:27:41,780 --> 00:27:45,770
,Matsumoto hid his face and luckily escaped
the punishment.

493
00:27:45,090 --> 00:27:45,650
,I was lucky that time

494
00:27:46,410 --> 00:27:47,480

,My butt is numb.

506
00:28:25,620 --> 00:28:27,070
,(Sometimes it really hurt!)

507
00:28:27,440 --> 00:28:33,310
,Yamasaki, don't talk like you're in a comedy skit please

508
00:28:34,150 --> 00:28:36,610
,Take your textbook out of your desk.

509
00:28:40,710 --> 00:28:43,090
,Open your books to page 57.

510
00:28:45,170 --> 00:28:48,520
,We're going to be studying the mordern 31 syllabled verse and the haiku.

511
00:28:48,750 --> 00:29:02,380
,Along with Ishikawa Takuboku and other famous poets, there's a section for the works of Suga Kenji--the chief producer of the show.

512
00:28:49,250 --> 00:28:54,250
,This textbook has a trap

513
00:29:00,410 --> 00:29:02,580
,Let's turn to the next page

514
00:29:07,350 --> 00:29:09,110
,Next is Suga Kenji.

515
00:29:10,210 --> 00:29:12,290
,Those cameras nailed us

516
00:29:12,380 --> 00:29:14,110
,You couldn't hide from them

517
00:29:17,180 --> 00:29:19,870
,This time they were right in front us

518
00:29:18,620 --> 00:29:19,840

519
00:29:20,040 --> 00:29:21,200
,Which one of us?! Which?

520
00:29:21,310 --> 00:29:22,040
,Why me!?

521
00:29:31,430 --> 00:29:35,190
,It was impossible to get away with
anything with those cameras

522
00:29:33,810 --> 00:29:38,400
,I'm going to read his Haiku, so repeat after me

523
00:29:39,910 --> 00:29:43,700
,If ramen doesn't get you high ratings... bring out dogs

524
00:29:49,680 --> 00:29:53,180
,Dirty Jokes while I'm around...are unforgiveable

525
00:29:58,760 --> 00:30:02,610
,TV people, All the good ones are dark (skin tone)

526
00:30:06,710 --> 00:30:09,550
,(That's not true. Just because he's dark...)

527
00:30:13,220 --> 00:30:15,160
Yama-chan, you stay serious.

528
00:30:16,340 --> 00:30:19,300
The following exercise aims to use their imagination.

529
00:30:19,300 --> 00:30:24,940
They will have to write in a blank book,
a story that matches with the title.

530
00:30:24,940 --> 00:30:26,840
And the subject is...

531
00:30:27,560 --> 00:30:31,020
The title of the book you will write is...

532
00:30:31,020 --> 00:30:34,020
"Three Matsuzaka's cows"

533
00:30:35,360 --> 00:30:39,630
Matsumoto, read the first part.

534
00:30:41,640 --> 00:30:44,810
"What is this feeling of freedom?"

535
00:30:44,810 --> 00:30:46,780
Thought Matsuzaka...

536
00:30:53,910 --> 00:30:56,280
Why does it sounds like a conclusion?

537
00:31:03,980 --> 00:31:07,860
Matsuzaka couldn't remains quiet, so he went outside.

538
00:31:08,280 --> 00:31:11,300
And suddenly...

539
00:31:12,240 --> 00:31:13,940
...Hanamasa arrived.

540
00:31:21,800 --> 00:31:23,780
I can ear the teacher's laughing !

541
00:31:33,600 --> 00:31:37,780
"I'm going to go to Kobe."

542
00:31:39,990 --> 00:31:41,400
Next, Yamasaki.

543
00:31:43,060 --> 00:31:47,200
Matsuzaka and Hanamasa were heading towards Maesawa.

544
00:31:47,200 --> 00:31:49,540
With the three little calves.

545
00:31:50,800 --> 00:31:54,040
How far...

546
00:31:54,040 --> 00:31:57,050
...did they take care of them...

547
00:31:57,050 --> 00:32:00,050
...by eating them?

548
00:32:15,940 --> 00:32:20,130
,Now, its kind of sudden, but we're going to do a quick pop quiz

549
00:32:22,700 --> 00:32:24,700
,You may begin now.

550
00:32:24,380 --> 00:32:29,150
,(Pop quiz starts)

551
00:32:29,790 --> 00:32:35,600
,They take the quiz very seriously

552
00:32:37,020 --> 00:32:38,380
,(We were very serious)

553
00:32:44,330 --> 00:32:47,750
(Nandenkanden's (Ramen restaurant Chain) President/ Owner: Kawahara

554
00:32:44,330 --> 00:32:47,750
,(The student that came in late)

555
00:32:55,240 --> 00:32:55,840
The president...

556
00:33:00,760 --> 00:33:02,180
What is he doing here?

557
00:33:22,820 --> 00:33:33,460
*parody of a detective in a drama played by Tachi Hiroshi

558
00:33:22,820 --> 00:33:33,460
Producer Nakamura

559
00:33:29,470 --> 00:33:31,440
Isn't that Tachi Hiroshi? Everyone, look!

560
00:33:32,680 --> 00:33:33,810
He was walking in the heavy rain.

561
00:33:34,560 --> 00:33:36,500
And he started walking from so far away

562
00:33:37,860 --> 00:33:39,360
Yeah, it was pretty far huh.

563
00:34:02,090 --> 00:34:03,740
Man the punishment hurts

564
00:34:07,500 --> 00:34:11,980
,11:30 a.m. The second class is English

565
00:34:12,040 --> 00:34:15,330
,They have this guy as their teacher

566
00:34:23,030 --> 00:34:24,410
,You were laughing

567
00:34:23,340 --> 00:34:28,410
Science Teacher
Murakami Shoji (comedian)

568
00:34:28,490 --> 00:34:29,590
Stand Up

569
00:34:33,670 --> 00:34:34,850
Good morning everyone

570
00:34:37,720 --> 00:34:38,900
Sit down please

571
00:34:43,060 --> 00:34:49,060
Before learning English, it's important to study American history, isn't it?

572
00:34:49,340 --> 00:34:52,500
The first President of the United States, Washington.

573
00:34:52,500 --> 00:34:54,500
Ah! Or was it Lincoln?

574
00:34:54,500 --> 00:34:57,300
Yes that's right, the first president was Lincoln.

575
00:34:57,300 --> 00:35:00,900
And the second president was Killer Khan (former wrestler).

576
00:35:05,480 --> 00:35:07,060
What!?

577
00:35:08,500 --> 00:35:09,980
Huh!? Me too?

578
00:35:20,720 --> 00:35:24,550
Professor, you are despicable.

579
00:35:24,680 --> 00:35:25,640
Let's study

580
00:35:28,300 --> 00:35:30,210
This is my mother

581
00:35:30,290 --> 00:35:35,670
At work, I've been asked lots of times to bring pictures of me from when I was little but...

582
00:35:35,870 --> 00:35:37,260
This is the only one I have.

583
00:35:37,900 --> 00:35:40,440
Actually, this isn't even me, its my little brother

584
00:35:49,120 --> 00:35:52,700
He was telling us sad stories the whole time

585
00:35:52,820 --> 00:35:56,520
I don't know why, but it just got funnier and funnier

586
00:36:03,920 --> 00:36:06,380
Why did he do that?

587
00:36:06,060 --> 00:36:08,430
He was changing his glasses a lot

588
00:36:07,070 --> 00:36:08,220
George

589
00:36:07,070 --> 00:36:12,220
Trainee George

590
00:36:08,380 --> 00:36:10,630
Cabbage

591
00:36:10,380 --> 00:36:11,630
Cabbage

592
00:36:15,550 --> 00:36:16,150
George

593
00:36:16,700 --> 00:36:17,460
Tomato

594
00:36:17,700 --> 00:36:19,460
(snorts)...Tomato

595
00:36:38,420 --> 00:36:39,640
again?

596
00:36:40,100 --> 00:36:41,630
He did it over and over

597
00:36:41,650 --> 00:36:45,190
I never understood why

598
00:36:43,340 --> 00:36:46,690
For some reason, Mr. Murakami changes his glasses

599
00:36:46,860 --> 00:36:49,520
Manhatan is a incredibly scary place.

600
00:36:50,830 --> 00:36:52,850
It's late

601
00:36:53,490 --> 00:36:56,520
Since its so late my mom is probably worrying about me

602
00:36:57,010 --> 00:36:58,080
I better go home now

603
00:36:58,200 --> 00:37:00,460
Myhattan is scary!

604
00:37:04,710 --> 00:37:05,310
Who's there?

605
00:37:09,270 --> 00:37:10,890
Is it just in my head?

606
00:37:13,090 --> 00:37:13,870
Who's there?

607
00:37:15,060 --> 00:37:16,210
Maybe I'm mistaken

608
00:37:17,280 --> 00:37:18,410
'cause I do that alot

609
00:37:21,540 --> 00:37:23,960
Who the hell are you!? Freak!

610
00:37:26,540 --> 00:37:29,340
I know you've been following me since "Akabane Bridge"

611
00:37:35,530 --> 00:37:36,570
"Akabane bridge" cracked me up

612
00:37:41,980 --> 00:37:46,030
(Murakami and George left the room due to some urgent business)

613
00:37:43,740 --> 00:37:45,480
What was with the glasses?

614
00:37:45,620 --> 00:37:48,690
I don't know, he changed them alot huh

615
00:37:55,710 --> 00:37:58,610
Mr. Shouji still isn't able to come back so

616
00:37:58,780 --> 00:38:02,570
we're going to study using an english educational video

617
00:38:04,390 --> 00:38:06,730
Okay, playing the video

618
00:38:09,330 --> 00:38:12,140
Let's read about Marco Polo in English

619
00:38:19,740 --> 00:38:23,360
(comedian/ former member of Gaki no Tsukai)

620
00:38:19,740 --> 00:38:23,360
Reader: Jimmy Onishi

621
00:38:41,110 --> 00:38:43,110
Its definetly not "es"

622
00:38:43,250 --> 00:38:45,650
He really got me there

623
00:38:53,000 --> 00:38:55,140
This is bad

624
00:38:53,090 --> 00:38:55,860
Yeah this is going to be rough

625
00:39:05,980 --> 00:39:07,140
That was a completely different word!

626
00:39:09,680 --> 00:39:11,040
Why on earth did he say "lotion"?

627
00:39:21,600 --> 00:39:24,320
Hou-san did very well here.

628
00:39:45,890 --> 00:39:46,810
He doesn't give up

629
00:40:00,200 --> 00:40:01,270
It's definitely not "Victor"

630
00:40:01,300 --> 00:40:03,730
definitely not "victor"!

631
00:40:03,930 --> 00:40:05,200
'victor'...

632
00:40:09,860 --> 00:40:13,730
He couldn't figure it out so he changed
it to 'victor'.

633
00:40:17,700 --> 00:40:20,880
Let's count to 100 in English.

634
00:40:20,880 --> 00:40:23,740
oh please we had enough already.

635
00:40:40,740 --> 00:40:42,300
What an idiot

636
00:40:42,940 --> 00:40:47,540
This is so not right! Something like this!

637
00:40:48,350 --> 00:40:51,010
This must be beyond any stretch of
their imagination

638
00:41:01,010 --> 00:41:02,020
How long is he going to keep this up?

639
00:41:04,710 --> 00:41:07,870
Pinching your face is cheating Matsumoto!

640
00:41:13,480 --> 00:41:15,120
This is impossible

641
00:41:17,030 --> 00:41:18,620
How much longer?

642
00:41:34,610 --> 00:41:35,740
He's too much

643
00:41:36,260 --> 00:41:37,530
who wouldn't laugh?

644
00:41:46,850 --> 00:41:48,550
Ahh, that is impossible, good thing its finally over

645
00:41:54,510 --> 00:41:56,760
No more. No.

646
00:41:59,190 --> 00:42:02,520
No, we've had enough.

647
00:42:01,040 --> 00:42:04,280
Let's Say days of the week in English

648
00:42:12,840 --> 00:42:14,520
Can I just say the ones I know?

649
00:42:16,630 --> 00:42:18,310
That's not how it works

650
00:42:23,340 --> 00:42:25,280
go easy on me please! OuCH!

651
00:42:25,450 --> 00:42:29,090
I'm done..I can't

652
00:42:29,300 --> 00:42:32,360
I can't take this anymore, Teacher.

653
00:42:37,830 --> 00:42:39,650
What days are his fingers? Is he saying them order?

654
00:42:44,330 --> 00:42:45,170
I couldn't help it

655
00:42:50,200 --> 00:42:51,820
What's the point if it isn't in the right order?

656
00:42:52,050 --> 00:42:54,190
Yeah, He's screwing up the order.

657
00:42:55,550 --> 00:42:56,680
What else...

658
00:42:57,780 --> 00:42:58,530
Kayoubi(Tuesday)-

659
00:42:58,760 --> 00:42:59,690
Kayoubi?

660
00:43:01,680 --> 00:43:04,020
Kaviar...I never learned that.

661
00:43:11,110 --> 00:43:12,640
no way... why didn't he ?!

662
00:43:16,640 --> 00:43:17,550
gees

663
00:43:18,740 --> 00:43:23,750
(Recess)

664
00:43:21,580 --> 00:43:23,690
That was tough

665
00:43:24,610 --> 00:43:27,590
I was already laughing every time he was about to push the start button.

666
00:43:27,740 --> 00:43:29,300
Really? Ehehe-- Uh oh!

667
00:43:30,800 --> 00:43:35,340
(Matsumoto forgets he's in the middle
of the batsu game and laughs)

668
00:43:36,180 --> 00:43:39,240
(Luckily he is safe because they missed it)

669
00:43:41,960 --> 00:43:44,280
You next class is P.E. so

670
00:43:44,450 --> 00:43:49,280
change into the P.E. clothes in the lockers and come to the gym.

671
00:43:50,870 --> 00:43:53,120
Where'd that voice come from?

672
00:43:56,310 --> 00:44:01,110
(Endo Notices something is wrong with his gym clothes.)

673
00:44:18,080 --> 00:44:20,020
(Chiaki (his wife) Love <3)

674
00:44:21,520 --> 00:44:26,680
It was mean

675
00:44:28,230 --> 00:44:30,660
We could take it though

676
00:44:31,010 --> 00:44:32,390
it's just...

677
00:44:35,400 --> 00:44:36,670
It was mean to Endo

678
00:44:39,850 --> 00:44:42,020
Get moving, go to the gym

679
00:44:42,020 --> 00:44:44,220
I did feel sorry for him

680
00:44:44,220 --> 00:44:47,230
It did hurt a little

681
00:44:53,730 --> 00:44:56,220
In the third hour, their next class is P.E.

682
00:44:53,730 --> 00:45:01,480
12:30 p.m.

683
00:44:53,730 --> 00:45:01,480
3 period - P.E.

684
00:44:56,540 --> 00:45:00,530
The person who is going to teach them is...

685
00:45:02,030 --> 00:45:07,700
Nandenkanden is the only student who also participates in the course

686
00:45:06,640 --> 00:45:09,220
Oh yes it's true. But why ?

687
00:45:12,970 --> 00:45:15,570
Ride On!!!!

688
00:45:15,110 --> 00:45:19,530

Hard Gay is here!!

692
00:45:18,060 --> 00:45:23,380
*Hard Gay is the performing name of Masaki Sumitani, who is a famous Japanese wrestler, comedian, and talent.

693
00:45:21,090 --> 00:45:22,020
Okaaay!!

694
00:45:24,590 --> 00:45:26,700
Don't be shy, Stare all you like!

695
00:45:27,110 --> 00:45:28,900
Here we go, check this out

696
00:45:29,070 --> 00:45:30,370
The smell of a gym

697
00:45:30,460 --> 00:45:32,310
FooooooooO!!

698
00:45:32,750 --> 00:45:34,650
Okaaaay.

699
00:45:34,710 --> 00:45:36,500
right, line up.

700
00:45:37,200 --> 00:45:39,770
First we will warm up with some excercises

701
00:45:39,860 --> 00:45:41,850
I'll call it the Hard Gay work out.

702
00:45:42,170 --> 00:45:43,940
Here I go

703
00:45:44,400 --> 00:45:45,030
1..

704
00:45:45,090 --> 00:45:45,410
2..

705
00:45:45,530 --> 00:45:46,050
3..

706
00:45:46,130 --> 00:45:46,650
4..

707
00:45:46,740 --> 00:45:47,930
you do it.

708
00:45:51,080 --> 00:45:55,500
There's a sudden downpour outside

709
00:45:52,320 --> 00:45:54,170
Imagine you're having sex

710
00:45:57,560 --> 00:45:58,540
That's some intense rain!

711
00:45:58,600 --> 00:45:59,550
Incredible

712
00:46:00,650 --> 00:46:02,210
That was some loud rain.

713
00:46:02,930 --> 00:46:05,800
Waaa! it hurts so much in these pants!!!

714
00:46:05,850 --> 00:46:07,300
Yeah, they will

715
00:46:07,450 --> 00:46:08,250
They're thin huh...

716
00:46:08,280 --> 00:46:11,410
This is how you thrust your pelvis.

717
00:46:11,780 --> 00:46:13,460
Its going to get faster

718
00:46:14,040 --> 00:46:15,510
much faster, watch!

719
00:46:15,660 --> 00:46:17,680
Faster! Faster!!

720
00:46:19,360 --> 00:46:21,180
Do you think this looks slow?

721
00:46:21,670 --> 00:46:22,800
You're wrong.

722
00:46:22,940 --> 00:46:26,560
I'm moving at such a fast speed that it looks like I'm moving slow.

723
00:46:26,700 --> 00:46:28,760
This is uber fast.

724
00:46:28,900 --> 00:46:31,560
It took me three years to master this.

725
00:46:31,740 --> 00:46:33,530
Today's class is...

726
00:46:33,610 --> 00:46:35,700
Hardle's Foooooo!! (Hurdles)

727
00:46:35,840 --> 00:46:39,860
In hurdles, it doesn't matter how fast go

728
00:46:40,060 --> 00:46:41,310
If you wanna be Hard Gay

729
00:46:41,390 --> 00:46:43,300
you gotta go jump hurdle's the Hard Gay way

730
00:46:43,650 --> 00:46:45,040
Got it? Watch closely

731
00:46:46,630 --> 00:46:50,300
It's how erotically can you get over the hurdles.

732
00:46:50,500 --> 00:46:52,120
You can rub against it

733
00:46:51,630 --> 00:46:54,170
You can improvise

734
00:46:52,270 --> 00:46:53,830
He's Crazy

735
00:46:57,360 --> 00:47:00,250
This is how you do it.

736
00:46:58,690 --> 00:47:01,750
That's not "jumping", he went under it!

737
00:47:02,680 --> 00:47:03,630
Matsumoto you first, Go

738
00:47:04,500 --> 00:47:06,060
How erocitally can you jump them

739
00:47:06,150 --> 00:47:07,390
that is the Hard Gay way.

740
00:47:09,820 --> 00:47:11,030
I was going to say "Ride On"

741
00:47:12,540 --> 00:47:14,880
This is really... Can we skip this?

742
00:47:15,050 --> 00:47:16,990
Let's do something else.

743
00:47:22,860 --> 00:47:24,650
This was really hard.

744
00:47:24,740 --> 00:47:25,580
You can go back Matsumoto.

745
00:47:25,870 --> 00:47:27,720
Hmmm?

746
00:47:28,760 --> 00:47:30,730
Hard Gay Fooooo!

747
00:47:30,730 --> 00:47:37,520
(Nakamura - Producer)

748
00:47:30,730 --> 00:47:37,520
Razor Ramon NP  enters

749
00:47:30,900 --> 00:47:34,720
Ohh, you're here

750
00:47:35,470 --> 00:47:37,610
Nakamura Producer - NP himself

751
00:47:37,840 --> 00:47:39,020
Okaaay

752
00:47:39,280 --> 00:47:41,310
Okaay

753
00:47:43,070 --> 00:47:46,250
We're buddies, pals!

754
00:47:46,280 --> 00:47:48,130
Okaay

755
00:47:49,350 --> 00:47:51,490
Did you see that unsure look on his face?

756
00:47:52,730 --> 00:47:54,260
This is too.. This is Dirty!

757
00:47:56,870 --> 00:47:58,400
Your boxers, (I can see) your boxers

758
00:47:58,510 --> 00:48:02,820
Do you know what kind of relationship I have with him?

759
00:48:02,880 --> 00:48:03,690
Oookaay

760
00:48:04,360 --> 00:48:06,840
Its this kind of relationship, yeaah

761
00:48:06,990 --> 00:48:08,370
Boxers

762
00:48:08,030 --> 00:48:09,390
Okaaaay!

763
00:48:14,240 --> 00:48:15,890
Isn't this fun!?

764
00:48:22,340 --> 00:48:25,180
Look at the camera

765
00:48:26,010 --> 00:48:29,110
We'll have them look at our faces

766
00:48:29,190 --> 00:48:32,720
We'll make them stare at them

767
00:48:33,010 --> 00:48:35,010
Its funnier watching the video

768
00:48:35,090 --> 00:48:35,790
Yeah

769
00:48:38,940 --> 00:48:41,140
They're really, really trying too hard

770
00:48:48,250 --> 00:48:49,490
What's this?

771
00:48:51,000 --> 00:48:57,480
Placed Note

772
00:48:51,000 --> 00:48:57,480
Put on this wig!!

773
00:49:00,370 --> 00:49:03,400
Look, see you had another advantage

774
00:49:02,330 --> 00:49:06,150
A blonde perm wig

775
00:49:03,520 --> 00:49:05,250
I had a lot of those didn't I?

776
00:49:11,900 --> 00:49:15,610
Hey, Guys. Its time for the long awaited lunch break

777
00:49:16,130 --> 00:49:19,860
There is a packed lunch in your bags. Eat up!

778
00:49:19,100 --> 00:49:20,200
Really?

779
00:49:20,260 --> 00:49:20,840
Sweet

780
00:49:20,670 --> 00:49:21,500
Let's eat!

781
00:49:21,880 --> 00:49:22,570
I'm so happy

782
00:49:25,580 --> 00:49:26,970
All right...

783
00:49:35,850 --> 00:49:38,620
This time its stale bread from his bag

784
00:49:44,610 --> 00:49:47,360
Look at mine...

785
00:49:49,180 --> 00:49:53,230
A box lunch of just beans

786
00:49:56,810 --> 00:50:04,160
Tanaka's Super
Deluxe Box Lunch

787
00:50:01,700 --> 00:50:02,420
That's luxurious

788
00:50:02,510 --> 00:50:03,550
Yeah it is

789
00:50:04,240 --> 00:50:05,440
What is this unfairness?

790
00:50:06,730 --> 00:50:08,030
I thought I could get one

791
00:50:09,330 --> 00:50:12,220
They only gave the big box
lunch to Tanaka

792
00:50:13,210 --> 00:50:16,450
Yamasaki's Box Lunch

793
00:50:13,730 --> 00:50:14,800
Mine's pretty normal

794
00:50:14,910 --> 00:50:16,040
What's yours (Matsumoto)?

795
00:50:24,920 --> 00:50:27,410
Why am I laughing?!

796
00:50:28,410 --> 00:50:31,360
that was a big box.

797
00:50:31,660 --> 00:50:32,900
It was pretty heavy, I think it was about 5 kg

798
00:50:36,950 --> 00:50:42,010
They all eat their various box lunches, and take a much needed rest

799
00:50:42,670 --> 00:50:44,730
However, that won't last for long

800
00:50:45,280 --> 00:50:48,200
For the assaults are going to begin again

801
00:50:56,920 --> 00:51:03,060
(Tsuruko) "Discussion on heartaches with Tsuruko"

802
00:51:03,090 --> 00:51:09,700
Grade 3 Class C
Shôfukutei Tsuroko's radio

803
00:51:03,090 --> 00:51:09,700
I answer all the questions that the students of
Kuchibiru West High school could ask themselves

804
00:51:09,700 --> 00:51:13,630
(Tsuruko) I receive a student who seems to have a little problem

805
00:51:13,630 --> 00:51:15,240
(Student) Nice to meet you

806
00:51:15,240 --> 00:51:17,110
(Tsuruko) What a beautiful voice, she is so cute!

807
00:51:17,110 --> 00:51:18,110
(Student) Thank you

808
00:51:18,110 --> 00:51:20,480
(Tsuruko) Could you introduce yourself?

809
00:51:20,480 --> 00:51:23,480
(Student) Grade 2, class C, my name is Kômoto Junko.

810
00:51:23,480 --> 00:51:26,480
(Jun) But everyone calls me Jun-chan

811
00:51:23,480 --> 00:51:35,690
Jun-chan
Komoto Junichi
(comedian, actor)

812
00:51:26,480 --> 00:51:29,350
(Tsuuruko) So, what is your problem?

813
00:51:29,350 --> 00:51:35,690
(Jun) Well, I'm currently in love with someone

814
00:51:35,690 --> 00:51:38,590
(Tsuruko) And how old are you now? ten...

815
00:51:38,590 --> 00:51:39,890
(Jun) I'm 17

816
00:51:39,890 --> 00:51:42,960
(Tsuroko) 17 years old... And is it the first time that you are in love?

817
00:51:42,960 --> 00:51:47,400
(Jun) Yes it’s the first time I’m feeling that, the first time

818
00:51:47,400 --> 00:51:51,170
(Tsuruko) It doesn't have to be easy to say his name on air, does it?

819
00:51:51,170 --> 00:51:53,640
(Tsuruko) Can you tell me the initial of his first name?

820
00:51:53,640 --> 00:51:56,240
(Jun) Aaah... Uhh... Hitoshi...

821
00:51:56,240 --> 00:51:56,840
(Tsuruko) Huh, what what?

822
00:51:56,840 --> 00:51:59,240
(Jun) H-kun. With H-kun...

823
00:51:59,240 --> 00:52:00,180
(Tsuruko) H-kun?

824
00:52:00,180 --> 00:52:01,780
(Jun) Because it's Hitoshi

825
00:52:01,780 --> 00:52:10,390
(Jun) When I do it with H-kun... It always ends... as soon as he finishes

826
00:52:10,390 --> 00:52:14,130
(Tsuruko) Ah yes, normally he must also ***

827
00:52:14,130 --> 00:52:18,300
(Jun) But Hitoshi-kun... H-kun... never does it

828
00:52:21,900 --> 00:52:24,980
What are they talking about?

829
00:52:24,980 --> 00:52:26,740
What is this discussion?

830
00:52:25,900 --> 00:52:26,740
Right.

831
00:52:27,440 --> 00:52:32,010
End of broadcast

832
00:52:35,850 --> 00:52:40,020
Jun chan appears

833
00:52:37,220 --> 00:52:38,380
I caught you!

834
00:52:40,020 --> 00:52:44,290
Jun chan, was that ok to say that on air?

835
00:52:44,560 --> 00:52:45,820
Sure, no problem !

836
00:52:46,090 --> 00:52:48,630
Because i didn't say any names...

837
00:52:48,630 --> 00:52:52,160
I didn't say Matsumoto-kun's name so it should be ok

838
00:52:52,160 --> 00:52:54,300
You should have said his name

839
00:52:54,300 --> 00:52:59,270
I couldn't do something like that, if i had done that...

840
00:52:59,270 --> 00:53:01,440
Matsumoto-kun would be angry

841
00:53:02,040 --> 00:53:05,510
But you "did it" with Matsumoto-kun, right?

842
00:53:05,510 --> 00:53:06,580
I did!

843
00:53:06,580 --> 00:53:11,020
In the pool...

844
00:53:11,020 --> 00:53:13,620
...we did it

845
00:53:22,640 --> 00:53:24,120
Give me a break...

846
00:53:47,040 --> 00:53:50,190
This isn't really... ah someone's here

847
00:53:50,590 --> 00:53:52,820
Please, make it stop

848
00:53:56,780 --> 00:53:58,810
He's so dark

849
00:53:58,860 --> 00:54:01,150
Vrrroooom

850
00:54:11,910 --> 00:54:16,500
*Itao Itsuji is a famous Comedian, he is part of the comedy duo 130R.

851
00:54:11,910 --> 00:54:16,500
Itao Itsuji makes a magnificent entrace

852
00:54:19,890 --> 00:54:21,590
This is too much

853
00:54:22,490 --> 00:54:24,540
What is he doing?!

854
00:54:26,220 --> 00:54:28,160
What is this

855
00:54:39,350 --> 00:54:42,210
Ahh, this is gonna suck

856
00:54:42,990 --> 00:54:44,810
Whose the jerk called Nandenkanden?

857
00:55:04,070 --> 00:55:06,440
Those glares where pretty fierce

858
00:55:18,880 --> 00:55:21,160
He's leaving with that?

859
00:55:33,570 --> 00:55:36,200
His leg got caught!

860
00:55:37,300 --> 00:55:40,480
It was a natural Itao exit!

861
00:55:45,650 --> 00:55:49,270
That was typical Itao

862
00:55:46,980 --> 00:55:49,560
His leg got caught?

863
00:55:49,640 --> 00:55:52,390
He got it caught really good on the seat!

864
00:55:52,820 --> 00:55:55,280
That last part was pretty cruel wasn't it!?

865
00:55:55,340 --> 00:55:55,860
Yeah it was

866
00:55:55,600 --> 00:55:57,050
He was supposed to look cool on the bike

867
00:55:57,130 --> 00:55:59,330
but when he went to get on--BANG, he smacked his leg on the second seat in the rear.

868
00:55:59,530 --> 00:56:00,460
And that's why everybody laughed

869
00:56:00,550 --> 00:56:02,370
Who wouldn't laugh at that?!

870
00:56:03,060 --> 00:56:04,650
How long was that company president with you?

871
00:56:04,770 --> 00:56:07,980
The president...I don't remember

872
00:56:09,220 --> 00:56:13,010
2:30 pm

873
00:56:09,220 --> 00:56:13,010
4th hour class  Science

874
00:56:09,220 --> 00:56:13,010
5 hours and 30 minutes passed

875
00:56:09,220 --> 00:56:14,140
2:30 p.m. 5 and a half hours have passed since the game started.

876
00:56:14,310 --> 00:56:15,930
Their next class is Science

877
00:56:16,570 --> 00:56:19,950
The teacher in charge is?!

878
00:56:21,350 --> 00:56:23,850
I feel nervous...

879
00:56:25,850 --> 00:56:29,430
If Nomo's pitching we're okay.

880
00:56:31,200 --> 00:56:34,090
For today's class, I'd like to study about

881
00:56:34,180 --> 00:56:36,660
the science of breathing.

882
00:56:37,530 --> 00:56:40,800
When we breath we take in oxygen and put out CO2

883
00:56:38,020 --> 00:56:45,250
*Hosshan (Hoshida Hidetoshi) is a comedian who is famous for his ability to put things up his nose.

884
00:56:38,020 --> 00:56:45,250
Hosshan Sensei

885
00:56:38,020 --> 00:56:45,250
Science Teacher

886
00:56:41,930 --> 00:56:44,530
But its kind of hard to see air.

887
00:56:44,960 --> 00:56:49,880
So I will teach you about breathing in a very easy to understand way.

888
00:56:50,080 --> 00:56:52,130
This is what we commonly use for this demonstration.

889
00:56:52,620 --> 00:56:58,260
(Japanese Fat Noodle)

890
00:56:52,620 --> 00:56:58,260
Udon

891
00:56:56,300 --> 00:56:57,220
I knew it.

892
00:56:57,340 --> 00:56:58,180
Watch closely

893
00:56:58,320 --> 00:57:00,030
Breathing, suck in, push out. You guys are even doing it right now.

894
00:57:06,240 --> 00:57:10,840
That's...who wouldn't laugh at that?

895
00:57:11,100 --> 00:57:12,200
Sensei, that's just wrong.

896
00:57:12,720 --> 00:57:18,940
Hosshan Sensei is a professional at passing things through his nose. (Do not try this at home)

897
00:57:16,250 --> 00:57:17,900
I'm gonna definitly laugh

898
00:57:23,850 --> 00:57:27,040
Is this really science?

899
00:57:25,880 --> 00:57:27,820
Is that going into your lung?

900
00:57:28,510 --> 00:57:29,810
Ok, we'll try a longer one.

901
00:57:29,900 --> 00:57:31,980
It's easier to see.

902
00:57:31,000 --> 00:57:31,810
stop it, We get it already

903
00:57:32,180 --> 00:57:32,910
We're good

904
00:57:33,860 --> 00:57:36,550
This is freeze frame of breathing

905
00:57:37,210 --> 00:57:39,930
Ahhh, I wonder where the air went

906
00:57:44,910 --> 00:57:46,530
We already get that

907
00:57:46,580 --> 00:57:48,000
We don't need to see it

908
00:57:48,120 --> 00:57:50,520
Give us a break, lets stop this

909
00:57:59,450 --> 00:58:01,880
Its still a pretty hard to see, isn't it

910
00:58:03,380 --> 00:58:05,230
This here is rubber

911
00:58:04,450 --> 00:58:08,360
Rubber

912
00:58:07,200 --> 00:58:08,850
As in a rubber jump rope?

913
00:58:09,110 --> 00:58:09,920
Yes

914
00:58:10,150 --> 00:58:12,170
Ahhhhhh

915
00:58:12,350 --> 00:58:14,050
Sensei, you don't have to...

916
00:58:14,200 --> 00:58:15,090
We're good

917
00:58:15,180 --> 00:58:17,690
You don't understand what oxygen isssaaaaaah

918
00:58:15,240 --> 00:58:15,850
We got it

919
00:58:24,520 --> 00:58:26,110
I think he doesn't get what it is

920
00:58:32,130 --> 00:58:32,650
Cough*

921
00:58:37,590 --> 00:58:38,720
Why did udon come out?

922
00:58:43,320 --> 00:58:44,450
Its Carbon Dioxide

923
00:58:47,540 --> 00:58:49,940
you breathed in oxygen, and then that's the CO2

924
00:58:49,250 --> 00:58:50,460
What is that

925
00:58:59,370 --> 00:59:02,780
I have some fun experiments too.

926
00:59:03,180 --> 00:59:08,100
Will someone drink this juice through this tube?

927
00:59:04,170 --> 00:59:07,840
Tube

928
00:59:08,530 --> 00:59:10,180
Its okay, this is juice

929
00:59:10,070 --> 00:59:11,420
I'm okay, No thanks

930
00:59:11,450 --> 00:59:14,460
When this tube comes out, will someone drink through it?

931
00:59:14,580 --> 00:59:16,050
We're good

932
00:59:16,770 --> 00:59:18,740
Sensei. That's pretty disgusting

933
00:59:19,720 --> 00:59:23,950
This is no good. this is the type of tube for going down the throat.

934
00:59:36,700 --> 00:59:38,550
Aww, come on lets stop this arleady

935
00:59:40,720 --> 00:59:45,520
If we're going to keep doing this, we can just keep the bambo sword guys here

936
00:59:45,660 --> 00:59:46,960
How can I get you to understand?

937
00:59:47,020 --> 00:59:47,800
We understand it

938
00:59:47,890 --> 00:59:48,520
We get it

939
00:59:48,640 --> 00:59:49,940
Alright, well tell me what is breathing then

940
00:59:50,580 --> 00:59:52,950
You inhale oxygen and exhale carbons dioxide.

941
00:59:50,580 --> 00:59:52,950
You inhale oxygen and exhale carbons dioxide.

942
00:59:50,580 --> 00:59:52,950
You inhale oxygen and exhale carbons dioxide.

943
00:59:50,580 --> 00:59:52,950
You inhale oxygen and exhale carbons dioxide.

944
00:59:52,950 --> 00:59:53,930
Yeah, but your forgetting about it going through the lungs.

945
00:59:54,020 --> 00:59:55,180
It goes through the lungs before you exhale it out.

946
00:59:56,100 --> 00:59:58,300
But the udon wasn't going through your lungs was it?

947
00:59:58,350 --> 00:59:59,330
It did!

948
00:59:59,590 --> 01:00:00,330
No it wasn't

949
01:00:00,330 --> 01:00:02,260
It did!

950
01:00:02,660 --> 01:00:03,400
It wasn't going through your lungs though right?

951
01:00:03,400 --> 01:00:05,600
It did!

952
01:00:05,600 --> 01:00:09,300
No, you're lungs are...

953
01:00:05,960 --> 01:00:09,300
IT DID! I'M TELLING YOU IT DID!

954
01:00:09,300 --> 01:00:12,270
It didn't pass through!

955
01:00:10,000 --> 01:00:12,270
IT DID!

956
01:00:12,310 --> 01:00:13,350
It was just going through your nose a mouth

957
01:00:14,010 --> 01:00:15,110
IT DID!

958
01:00:19,230 --> 01:00:21,200
We've got no choice but to accept it, he's the science teacher.

959
01:00:23,220 --> 01:00:25,220
Ahhh-- My bum is getting swollen already.

960
01:00:25,510 --> 01:00:28,520
It's intense ---Owwww that hurts

961
01:00:29,150 --> 01:00:30,950
We understand it! We get it

962
01:00:31,320 --> 01:00:32,740
Should we do it with Bracken next?

963
01:00:31,320 --> 01:00:36,670
*Bracken (warabi) is a wild plant with large leaves that grows thickly on hills and in woods and turns brown in the fall.

964
01:00:33,060 --> 01:00:34,620
Say whaa!?

965
01:00:33,060 --> 01:00:34,620
Whaaa!?

966
01:00:34,730 --> 01:00:39,010
Don't whine so much when I say a Japanese food like Warabi.

967
01:00:37,250 --> 01:00:40,050
Warabi (Bracken)

968
01:00:40,230 --> 01:00:42,830
What type of class is this?

969
01:00:44,390 --> 01:00:45,400
This is the "just right" pattern

970
01:00:46,590 --> 01:00:47,980
It's just right.

971
01:00:55,290 --> 01:00:57,060
I've never heard of that pattern

972
01:00:57,110 --> 01:00:58,300
There's no such thing

973
01:00:58,880 --> 01:01:01,740
There is one. Even in respiration, when you inhale the just right amount of breath!

974
01:01:09,870 --> 01:01:11,110
It hit my balls.

975
01:01:13,390 --> 01:01:15,560
Going in is hell, but coming out is hell too!

976
01:01:15,770 --> 01:01:19,580
This is the first time I've been stuck in the middle of the "just right" pattern

977
01:01:20,280 --> 01:01:23,340
Endo, will you try it? The 'just right' pattern

978
01:01:22,560 --> 01:01:24,530
I'll pass. I'd mess it up for sure

979
01:01:23,920 --> 01:01:25,280
Endo, just try it for me!

980
01:01:25,570 --> 01:01:27,560
That really is "just right", I can see it you know.

981
01:01:27,620 --> 01:01:29,880
If you can see it then its not "just right"

982
01:01:29,940 --> 01:01:31,440
I just see the end in your nostril

983
01:01:31,060 --> 01:01:33,410
If you can see it then its not "just right"

984
01:01:37,050 --> 01:01:38,060
It didn't make it around into your throat did it.

985
01:01:38,260 --> 01:01:39,630
So it's the right distance, right?

986
01:01:45,240 --> 01:01:50,500
Breathing therefore means breathing in oxygen and exhaling CO2.

987
01:01:50,500 --> 01:01:54,440
Hosshan sensei, someone asks you on the phone.

988
01:01:54,440 --> 01:01:59,010
Please go immediately to the teacher's lounge.

989
01:01:59,010 --> 01:02:00,580
I hope you have learned the lesson.

990
01:02:00,580 --> 01:02:02,580
We will never forget it.

991
01:02:03,660 --> 01:02:04,860
And at the end...

992
01:02:08,100 --> 01:02:09,560
The science teacher was awful!

993
01:02:09,560 --> 01:02:11,560
You should watch him.

994
01:02:12,360 --> 01:02:15,830
Hosshan sensei cannot return at this time.

995
01:02:15,830 --> 01:02:18,640
You will still learn through a video.

996
01:02:18,640 --> 01:02:20,700
I hate this kind of video!

997
01:02:25,300 --> 01:02:32,280
What is the food chain?

998
01:02:34,100 --> 01:02:42,540
In the countryside, each living being eats and is eaten by another living being.

999
01:02:45,100 --> 01:02:48,560
This is called a food chain.

1000
01:02:48,560 --> 01:02:53,520
The ecological balance is managed from this chain.

1001
01:02:55,380 --> 01:03:01,260
The first link of the food chain is a microorganism found in the earth.

1002
01:03:03,060 --> 01:03:05,820
And this microorganism is...

1003
01:03:09,600 --> 01:03:12,160
...the "Heipo".

1004
01:03:12,160 --> 01:03:20,100
While it formed only one Heipo at the start, it multiplies thanks to the sunlight.

1005
01:03:20,520 --> 01:03:24,620
This is called the Heipo multiplier.

1006
01:03:30,940 --> 01:03:32,720
How can you hold it !?

1007
01:03:36,640 --> 01:03:38,720
What is this video...

1008
01:03:39,200 --> 01:03:41,720
I'am afraid about the next...

1009
01:03:41,720 --> 01:03:43,860
This is not good...

1010
01:03:45,350 --> 01:03:51,420
After having multiplied, it moves to the surface of the earth.

1011
01:03:51,900 --> 01:03:56,580
And suddenly, it is devoured by herbivores or insects.

1012
01:03:56,920 --> 01:03:58,700
The herbivore that ate the Heipo is...

1013
01:04:03,570 --> 01:04:06,070
You guys are seriously strong!

1014
01:04:11,140 --> 01:04:15,900
In addition, these primary carnivores are themselves devoured by secondary carnivores.

1015
01:04:17,380 --> 01:04:24,700
As long as the animals are alive, they evacuate their fecal matter, and thus the Heipo returns to the earth.

1016
01:04:26,620 --> 01:04:29,730
It plays an important role in the ecological balance...

1017
01:04:34,540 --> 01:04:37,070
This video is horrible!

1018
01:04:37,260 --> 01:04:39,000
It's because of his laugh!

1019
01:04:49,010 --> 01:04:51,850
This video is filled of bad things!

1020
01:04:51,850 --> 01:04:55,660
That's true, they wanted it unnoticed.

1021
01:04:56,080 --> 01:04:57,800
A really bad video...

1022
01:04:58,900 --> 01:05:02,190
And the laugh at the end...

1023
01:05:04,000 --> 01:05:05,760
Science is terrifying.

1024
01:05:04,660 --> 01:05:06,730
Terrifying !

1025
01:05:05,760 --> 01:05:07,830
Science is terrifying.

1026
01:05:06,730 --> 01:05:07,830
Terrifying.

1027
01:05:09,040 --> 01:05:13,400
Tired of laughing so much in science class, they are now taking a break.

1028
01:05:13,860 --> 01:05:18,320
This is where Matsumoto's concentration weakens.

1029
01:05:19,040 --> 01:05:22,700
I'm thinking that... guys, really...

1030
01:05:24,280 --> 01:05:31,890
When you see I'm about to laugh, you might...

1031
01:05:31,890 --> 01:05:32,500
You see ?

1032
01:05:32,500 --> 01:05:33,480
What ?

1033
01:05:44,040 --> 01:05:46,140
It's not our fault.

1034
01:05:47,360 --> 01:05:48,800
We have nothing to do with it at all!

1035
01:05:48,800 --> 01:05:52,420
We listened seriously to what you had to say.

1036
01:05:52,620 --> 01:05:54,580
Exactly.

1037
01:05:56,780 --> 01:05:59,180
Ah, did it touch your balls?

1038
01:05:59,180 --> 01:06:01,720
I pity you !

1039
01:06:02,380 --> 01:06:06,000
For example, if one of my senpai
would be in this kind of batsu game,

1040
01:06:06,000 --> 01:06:12,980
and from the moment I see that he begins to laugh...

1041
01:06:13,730 --> 01:06:18,440
I will laugh before him, in order to take his punishment...

1042
01:06:18,440 --> 01:06:26,110
Before ? So, if you are going to laugh, I have to laugh before to take the hit for you, right?

1043
01:06:26,110 --> 01:06:31,850
I didn't mean to say it so directly but...

1044
01:06:31,850 --> 01:06:33,560
But, yes...

1045
01:06:33,960 --> 01:06:35,320
Yes.

1046
01:06:46,460 --> 01:06:50,870
We listened carefully, we didn't do anything wrong !

1047
01:06:54,580 --> 01:06:57,900
It's totaly your fault!

1048
01:07:00,760 --> 01:07:03,500
For example, if Shinusukeniyan...

1049
01:07:03,960 --> 01:07:04,880
You see...

1050
01:07:04,880 --> 01:07:08,760
If ever, both of us had participated in this batsu game...

1051
01:07:08,760 --> 01:07:14,860
As soon as I thought:
"Aah ! Shinsukeniyan can't take it anymore!"

1052
01:07:14,860 --> 01:07:18,000
As he reached his limit, well...

1053
01:07:37,120 --> 01:07:38,520
He is scary! He is scary!

1054
01:07:43,140 --> 01:07:45,820
The ground shakes when the guy is coming!

1055
01:07:44,800 --> 01:07:45,820
It's a little scary.

1056
01:07:53,000 --> 01:07:55,940
The next class is a sociology field trip.

1057
01:07:56,190 --> 01:07:59,870
So now we're going to get on a bus, and go study society.

1058
01:08:01,190 --> 01:08:05,190
(6 hours and 30 minutes since it started)

1059
01:08:01,190 --> 01:08:05,190
3:30 p.m.

1060
01:08:01,190 --> 01:08:05,190
5th hour class -Sociology field trip

1061
01:08:02,170 --> 01:08:05,590
3:30 p.m. the 5th hour class is a field trip for sociology.

1062
01:08:05,650 --> 01:08:12,090
Riding the school bus for a sociology field trip!

1063
01:08:05,760 --> 01:08:09,300
The quickly board the bus and depart for their destination

1064
01:08:09,760 --> 01:08:10,450
However...

1065
01:08:10,560 --> 01:08:16,210
These four students of sociology are about to discover the terrifying reality of society.

1066
01:08:13,290 --> 01:08:18,770
Even here an ingenious trap is...

1067
01:08:16,480 --> 01:08:19,580
Now, the thing waiting for them is?

1068
01:08:21,580 --> 01:08:24,090
Huh? What is that?

1069
01:08:25,680 --> 01:08:28,140
It looks like that car is having engine trouble

1070
01:08:29,750 --> 01:08:31,540
Wha-! Isn't that Mori Shinichi?

1071
01:08:29,750 --> 01:08:39,750
*(Mori Shinichi, born November 18, 1947 in Kofu, Yamanashi) is a Japanese male enka singer and composer, who also sings folk and pop music. His total sales of gramophone records and CDs has reportedly been over 90 million copies.

1072
01:08:32,710 --> 01:08:41,050
Mori Shinichi in a pickle

1073
01:08:32,710 --> 01:08:41,050
because his car broke down.

1074
01:08:39,690 --> 01:08:42,610
Really? I wouldn't know Shinichi even if I saw his face...

1075
01:08:42,850 --> 01:08:45,830
Everybody Safe

1076
01:08:42,860 --> 01:08:45,410
I never thought I'd see Mori Shinichi in a place like this

1077
01:08:50,560 --> 01:08:53,400
The first place they come to is one of the longest suspension bridges in Japan.

1078
01:08:53,530 --> 01:08:55,140
Momijidani Suspension Bridge

1079
01:08:55,230 --> 01:08:57,410
About this time all four of them forget they are in a batsu game

1080
01:08:57,490 --> 01:08:59,020
and go on an innocent stroll through the air

1081
01:08:59,410 --> 01:09:03,800
This bridge's total length is 320 meters! (1,050 ft)

1082
01:09:03,890 --> 01:09:04,550
Wow, that's something

1083
01:09:04,600 --> 01:09:05,640
Woah, its really shaking.

1084
01:09:07,580 --> 01:09:11,310
I still don't know why they took us all the way over there.

1085
01:09:10,370 --> 01:09:12,970
The four of them head back towards the bus

1086
01:09:10,450 --> 01:09:15,110
A new trap catches the four

1087
01:09:13,060 --> 01:09:17,270
but there is an unexpected trap waiting for them...

1088
01:09:18,160 --> 01:09:19,830
Ah! We're getting a parking ticket!

1089
01:09:19,890 --> 01:09:21,200
Whaa!? A ticket?

1090
01:09:22,700 --> 01:09:25,550
WHERE do you think you're parking?

1091
01:09:27,010 --> 01:09:32,200
Police Grandmas Appear on the Scene

1092
01:09:28,120 --> 01:09:29,310
A parking lot...

1093
01:09:36,300 --> 01:09:38,600
Tanaka wasn't the one driving so...

1094
01:09:39,490 --> 01:09:42,970
Where do you think you're parking?

1095
01:09:44,490 --> 01:09:45,780
Where are you parking?

1096
01:09:49,920 --> 01:09:54,520
For some reason the police grandma kisses Tanaka.

1097
01:09:51,600 --> 01:09:54,050
Don't ever park there again.

1098
01:09:54,680 --> 01:09:56,010
How many times does she do this?

1099
01:10:00,130 --> 01:10:01,520
She just wants to do THAT doesn't she.

1100
01:10:04,210 --> 01:10:06,200
And you're even called out on top of that

1101
01:10:08,550 --> 01:10:09,920
What just happened?

1102
01:10:10,030 --> 01:10:11,790
Her face was HUGE!

1103
01:10:11,730 --> 01:10:13,200
you got kissed!?

1104
01:10:13,410 --> 01:10:13,710
Yes.

1105
01:10:14,120 --> 01:10:15,270
She's really stepping on the gas

1106
01:10:15,610 --> 01:10:16,520
That's dangerous

1107
01:10:16,620 --> 01:10:17,320
They're flying!

1108
01:10:22,150 --> 01:10:23,470
Haha that's kinda funny

1109
01:10:26,160 --> 01:10:27,400
Tanaka are you ok?

1110
01:10:27,650 --> 01:10:29,370
No no no..I'm not okay...

1111
01:10:28,710 --> 01:10:31,330
Shall we go to the next stop?

1112
01:10:32,060 --> 01:10:33,970
After having been slowed down

1113
01:10:32,180 --> 01:10:36,610
Hurrying to the next stop

1114
01:10:34,050 --> 01:10:35,620
the party heads towards their next stop

1115
01:10:35,670 --> 01:10:37,040
However...

1116
01:10:37,880 --> 01:10:38,820
Uh oh

1117
01:10:42,020 --> 01:10:46,460
What the...Mori Shinichi is getting a parking ticket!

1118
01:10:42,680 --> 01:10:49,450
Mori Shinichi recieving a parking ticket

1119
01:10:52,620 --> 01:10:55,800
How did you not laugh at that?

1120
01:10:58,460 --> 01:11:00,550
Seeing them the second time was just too much

1121
01:11:03,470 --> 01:11:04,180
Scary

1122
01:11:07,670 --> 01:11:10,130
I bet that's why they were driving so fast

1123
01:11:10,520 --> 01:11:12,100
Ah it all makes sense now

1124
01:11:12,960 --> 01:11:19,020
The party makes a pit stop

1125
01:11:13,650 --> 01:11:18,810
Because their destination is so far away, they stop for a bathroom break.

1126
01:11:19,020 --> 01:11:20,240
However even here...

1127
01:11:22,880 --> 01:11:26,220
Wha!? We're getting another parking ticket!

1128
01:11:26,250 --> 01:11:27,240
Not again

1129
01:11:28,300 --> 01:11:34,070
The school bus gets parking ticket again

1130
01:11:34,190 --> 01:11:37,300
WHERE d'ya think you're parking?

1131
01:11:41,350 --> 01:11:43,100
Come with me

1132
01:11:43,160 --> 01:11:44,760
Ah no, spare me!

1133
01:11:47,640 --> 01:11:48,860
I'm begging you!

1134
01:11:51,420 --> 01:11:53,950
PLEASE, spare me!

1135
01:11:55,010 --> 01:11:55,960
I'm sorry...

1136
01:11:56,190 --> 01:11:58,690
WHERE d'ya think you're parking!?

1137
01:11:58,820 --> 01:12:03,490
There she goes again... That's long

1138
01:12:07,120 --> 01:12:08,280
That's pretty scary

1139
01:12:08,390 --> 01:12:09,440
It was terrifying

1140
01:12:12,230 --> 01:12:15,490
The Mini Patrol Car speeds off to the next scene

1141
01:12:21,650 --> 01:12:22,700
Were they really that fast?

1142
01:12:21,920 --> 01:12:23,630
Shall we go to the next place

1143
01:12:28,390 --> 01:12:29,720
That was funny

1144
01:12:29,030 --> 01:12:38,600
The next stop is an old lady who is popular for her traditional handiwork

1145
01:12:29,550 --> 01:12:35,220
After picking themselves back up they head towards the next destination.

1146
01:12:36,750 --> 01:12:43,210
Studying Traditional Weaving

1147
01:12:39,780 --> 01:12:42,690
I've done this since I was kid so I've gotten pretty used to it...

1148
01:12:42,870 --> 01:12:46,870
They admire her handiwork, and the field trip comes to an end...

1149
01:12:47,050 --> 01:12:48,540
or was supposed to...

1150
01:12:48,670 --> 01:12:51,310
Ahhh, Again?!

1151
01:12:51,390 --> 01:12:56,470
Police Grandmas on a stake out

1152
01:12:51,530 --> 01:12:52,520
Again?

1153
01:12:56,560 --> 01:12:58,700
hey hey Hey HEY!

1154
01:12:58,640 --> 01:13:02,090
You never learn!

1155
01:13:02,200 --> 01:13:05,290
Our teacher (Fujiwara) said he'd take responsibilty.

1156
01:13:05,350 --> 01:13:08,370
But if we don't deal with the younger generation...

1157
01:13:08,030 --> 01:13:08,920
please no

1158
01:13:08,940 --> 01:13:15,190
Matsumoto trying to escape

1159
01:13:10,980 --> 01:13:11,950
Ah! It wasn't you

1160
01:13:12,030 --> 01:13:14,330
You, you're perfect. I'm going to teach you a lesson.

1161
01:13:19,130 --> 01:13:22,010
I've said it over and over but you never learn

1162
01:13:22,120 --> 01:13:25,700
WHERE do you think you're parking?

1163
01:13:26,450 --> 01:13:27,020
Look!

1164
01:13:29,300 --> 01:13:32,850
Where do you think you're parking?

1165
01:13:29,390 --> 01:13:30,520
Isn't that abuse?

1166
01:13:34,080 --> 01:13:35,870
That's gross

1167
01:13:44,340 --> 01:13:49,310
Think about the rules of the world a little!

1168
01:13:51,140 --> 01:13:52,680
You mean you guys?

1169
01:13:52,820 --> 01:13:54,690
They had you for a long time didn't they.

1170
01:13:55,530 --> 01:13:57,090
Yeah it was pretty long

1171
01:14:05,600 --> 01:14:06,890
What are they staring at?

1172
01:14:07,460 --> 01:14:08,740
I wonder what they found...

1173
01:14:10,950 --> 01:14:13,800
(8 and hours and 30 minutes has past since it started)

1174
01:14:10,950 --> 01:14:13,830
5:30 p.m.

1175
01:14:12,480 --> 01:14:17,050
5:30 p.m. After returning from the field trip from hell,

1176
01:14:17,160 --> 01:14:19,170
the four of them relax in the classroom.

1177
01:14:20,510 --> 01:14:23,190
Meanwhile, Endo goes to the bathroom by himself.

1178
01:14:20,530 --> 01:14:25,430
Endo going to the bathroom alone.

1179
01:14:38,970 --> 01:14:44,820
Atou Kai using the john next to Endo.

1180
01:14:38,970 --> 01:14:48,970
Atou Kai (realname Atou Kouichi) is a Japanese Actor who has been in over 45 films, and over 50 telivision shows. He has also written 3 books and been in commercials.

1181
01:14:48,090 --> 01:14:50,700
I never thought I'd run into him in a bathroom.

1182
01:14:59,680 --> 01:15:00,790
Excuse me,(I'll be leaving first)

1183
01:15:13,770 --> 01:15:14,630
Couldn't see that at all.

1184
01:15:14,950 --> 01:15:16,420
What happened?

1185
01:15:16,490 --> 01:15:17,230
Yeah, what was that all about?

1186
01:15:17,430 --> 01:15:19,460
just a little happening.

1187
01:15:20,130 --> 01:15:21,710
Something you weren't expecting?

1188
01:15:21,610 --> 01:15:22,850
Nope, NOT expecting that

1189
01:15:23,020 --> 01:15:25,150
Definitely was NOT what I thought would happen

1190
01:15:25,500 --> 01:15:30,190
(9 hours since it started)

1191
01:15:25,500 --> 01:15:30,190
6 hour period - Music

1192
01:15:25,500 --> 01:15:30,200
6:00 p.m.

1193
01:15:25,630 --> 01:15:29,500
6:00 p.m. 9 hours have past since the start of the game.

1194
01:15:30,230 --> 01:15:32,100
The next class is music.

1195
01:15:31,390 --> 01:15:40,100
During the October 9th, (Sun.) "Downtown no Gaki no Tsukai" broadcast, this scene from the batsu game was not aired. Enjoy!!

1196
01:15:32,110 --> 01:15:36,180
Here a VERY famous teacher is about to make his appearance!

1197
01:15:37,300 --> 01:15:38,510
This is getting old..

1201
01:15:53,960 --> 01:15:57,840
"Okuru Kotoba" is like the Japanese version of Good Riddance by Green Day or "Pomp and Circumstances", a standard graduation song.

1202
01:15:53,960 --> 01:15:58,500
"Okuru Kotoba"

1203
01:15:57,950 --> 01:16:03,160
Hori is a famous comedian known for his impersonations, there is even a type of impersonation named after him called "Horineta" because of his "things they would never say" impersonation skits.

1204
01:16:03,220 --> 01:16:06,060
(Hori)

1205
01:16:03,220 --> 01:16:06,060
Kinpachi Sensei

1206
01:16:03,220 --> 01:16:06,060
Right now he is impersonating Kinpachi sensei, who was portrayed by the singer and actor Tesuya Takeda, who also wrote and performed the song "Okuru Kotoba" when he was in the band Kai'en-tai.

1207
01:16:06,690 --> 01:16:11,060
"The words I send to you"

1208
01:16:11,530 --> 01:16:15,960
"As you go away into the light and shadows"

1209
01:16:16,390 --> 01:16:25,500
"of the town in the gloaming"

1210
01:16:25,590 --> 01:16:27,210
Oh! Wrong show?

1211
01:16:27,520 --> 01:16:29,790
Well, Good morning!

1212
01:16:30,080 --> 01:16:30,960
Hello

1213
01:16:30,080 --> 01:16:30,970
Hey

1214
01:16:31,070 --> 01:16:34,720
Today I would like to do some impersonations.

1215
01:16:35,510 --> 01:16:37,420
Umm. Let's start with Terakado Jimon,

1216
01:16:35,510 --> 01:16:40,900
*Terakado Jimon is a famous comedian, also known as Nature Jimon

1217
01:16:37,470 --> 01:16:40,530
So Terakado Jimon is surrounded by a bunch of other celebrity judges,

1218
01:16:40,840 --> 01:16:46,040
and the Terakado Jimon that hardly ever gets called on...gets called on.

1219
01:16:46,080 --> 01:16:47,550
Ooo Ooo Pick me! Pick me!

1220
01:16:47,580 --> 01:16:48,120
Yes, Terakado Jimon

1221
01:16:48,210 --> 01:16:50,650
Oh. That's nice. Yup yup, umhmm.

1222
01:16:50,720 --> 01:16:51,160
Okay let's move on...

1223
01:16:51,200 --> 01:16:52,210
Ooo Ooo Pick me! Over Here!

1224
01:16:52,260 --> 01:16:52,840
Yes, Terakado Jimon

1225
01:16:52,870 --> 01:16:54,460
Oh, very good, that's great, yup yup, umhmm.

1226
01:16:54,560 --> 01:16:55,060
Okay, let's go to the next one

1227
01:16:55,080 --> 01:16:55,490
Ooo Ooo Pick me! Pick me!

1228
01:16:55,580 --> 01:16:56,040
Yes, Terakado Jimon

1229
01:16:56,090 --> 01:16:56,740
I also think so, yeah its good. umhmm.

1230
01:17:01,930 --> 01:17:02,890
Okay lets try another one

1231
01:17:04,440 --> 01:17:08,680
The thing that I ate was pudding...

1232
01:17:05,060 --> 01:17:08,680
Cocorico's Tanaka

1233
01:17:09,100 --> 01:17:11,990
The thing that I ate was pudding!

1234
01:17:09,440 --> 01:17:11,530
Yamasaki Hosei

1235
01:17:16,640 --> 01:17:20,580
That really sounded like Yamachan

1236
01:17:20,700 --> 01:17:22,910
That didn't sound like me...is this Music Class?

1237
01:17:22,100 --> 01:17:23,990
Yeah, this isn't a music class at all!

1238
01:17:27,460 --> 01:17:28,780
It's 'cause rythm is very important

1239
01:17:28,930 --> 01:17:30,520
Are you ready?

1240
01:17:30,520 --> 01:17:32,520
Here I go...

1241
01:17:33,540 --> 01:17:34,950
(As Yamasaki) As for me---!

1242
01:17:37,740 --> 01:17:38,780
Ah man

1243
01:17:41,150 --> 01:17:43,240
Sorry, sorry, lets move on

1244
01:17:49,030 --> 01:17:53,840
Okay how about Katsura Koeda from the Tantei Knight Scoop show.

1245
01:17:57,730 --> 01:17:59,100
What is this, (I'd like to know)

1246
01:18:16,490 --> 01:18:18,260
Okay, what I really want to do today is

1247
01:18:18,370 --> 01:18:20,430
"Things they would NEVER say"

1248
01:18:20,540 --> 01:18:22,580
So let's do a little bit of those

1249
01:18:22,710 --> 01:18:25,360
Okay something I would never say (As Kinpachi Sensei)

1250
01:18:22,710 --> 01:18:27,710
Kinpachi-sensei is the story of an 3rd year junior high school class in Japan; its teacher is Kinpachi Sakamoto, played by Tetsuya Takeda.

1251
01:18:25,410 --> 01:18:26,400
Okay firstly:

1252
01:18:27,770 --> 01:18:30,860
You know what...In this world, if you have money

1253
01:18:31,000 --> 01:18:32,550
you can buy anything! Oh yeah!

1254
01:18:33,190 --> 01:18:34,200
Secondly:

1255
01:18:35,040 --> 01:18:37,910
I never thought that when I got to this age that...

1256
01:18:38,150 --> 01:18:40,810
I would be F*#@ing this often.

1257
01:18:45,930 --> 01:18:47,160
Definetly wouldn't say that

1258
01:18:47,210 --> 01:18:48,900
Tanaka was laughing too

1259
01:18:57,450 --> 01:18:58,720
Okay, Thank you.

1260
01:18:58,820 --> 01:19:00,310
Let's do another one

1261
01:19:00,560 --> 01:19:02,760
Something Enari Kazuki would never say...

1262
01:19:00,560 --> 01:19:05,560
*Enari Kazuki is a young actor Born Nov. 9th, 1984.

1263
01:19:05,580 --> 01:19:07,170
Take a shower first, then get back to me.

1264
01:19:15,060 --> 01:19:16,420
Yeah, he probably wouldn't say that...

1265
01:19:23,800 --> 01:19:25,440
What was that (kind of blow) just now?

1266
01:19:25,440 --> 01:19:27,120
Did you understand ?

1267
01:19:28,640 --> 01:19:30,140
So, thank you.

1268
01:19:31,080 --> 01:19:33,680
Thank you, hum.

1269
01:19:35,940 --> 01:19:37,520
Bye thank you, bye thank you.

1270
01:19:38,500 --> 01:19:41,540
It would be nice if you die, bye bye.

1271
01:19:43,200 --> 01:19:46,020
My butt still hurts.

1272
01:19:46,020 --> 01:19:50,640
When he says "Ouch, I'm in pain"... well it's normal, but...

1273
01:19:50,640 --> 01:19:52,640
But...

1274
01:19:52,060 --> 01:19:53,720
HOY ! MATSUMOTO !

1275
01:19:55,250 --> 01:20:00,590
Suddenly, a Bosozoku gang burst into the classroom

1276
01:20:02,530 --> 01:20:05,600
Seems that you dared to touch my girlfriend.

1277
01:20:04,760 --> 01:20:07,820
We will not forgive you for touching Tecchan's girlfriend! We're going to slaughter you!

1278
01:20:09,170 --> 01:20:11,170
Wait!

1279
01:20:12,700 --> 01:20:17,310
I beg you to not touch them! My precious students!

1280
01:20:16,600 --> 01:20:18,060
Who are you!?

1281
01:20:18,580 --> 01:20:20,580
I am the head teacher of these students!

1282
01:20:20,580 --> 01:20:22,180
I am the head teacher of these students!

1283
01:20:22,180 --> 01:20:24,680
I am the head teacher of these students!

1284
01:20:24,220 --> 01:20:27,260
What are you saying, shut the fuck up !

1285
01:20:34,090 --> 01:20:38,360
I will not forgive those who raise their hands on my students!

1286
01:20:39,830 --> 01:20:41,330
And uh...

1287
01:20:46,040 --> 01:20:48,560
It really was not the time!

1288
01:20:56,210 --> 01:20:58,880
Apologize for your mistake!

1289
01:20:58,880 --> 01:21:02,650
This is what a real man should do.

1290
01:21:11,960 --> 01:21:14,700
Excuse us!

1291
01:21:31,380 --> 01:21:32,660
Why is he laughing!?

1292
01:21:33,180 --> 01:21:35,320
I'm tired of this.

1293
01:21:37,460 --> 01:21:39,700
Please, be serious a moment!

1294
01:21:41,080 --> 01:21:42,690
Don't laugh anymore!

1295
01:21:48,480 --> 01:21:54,560
6:30 p.m.

1296
01:21:48,480 --> 01:21:54,560
9 Hours and 30 minutes

1297
01:21:49,410 --> 01:21:50,950
The long class ends

1298
01:21:51,140 --> 01:21:53,460
and the four of them are starting to look tired.

1299
01:21:55,200 --> 01:21:57,240
However, behind the scenes...

1300
01:22:00,140 --> 01:22:03,010
Hamada arrives on the scene

1301
01:22:00,760 --> 01:22:03,450
Hamada finally arrives at the school.

1302
01:22:04,260 --> 01:22:05,520
I came to inflict pain

1303
01:22:07,120 --> 01:22:08,510
I'll show 'em no mercy

1304
01:22:09,540 --> 01:22:14,050
First, he will check out the Operation Headquarters and start directing the action from behind the scenes.

1305
01:22:11,590 --> 01:22:17,070
Operation HQ

1306
01:22:17,470 --> 01:22:23,780
Naturally, his arrival means that this Batsu game is only going to become more intense!

1307
01:22:28,470 --> 01:22:30,310
PuPu-

1308
01:22:34,870 --> 01:22:36,240
Didn't that sound like 'Yossha~! (Yes!!)?

1309
01:22:39,050 --> 01:22:40,720
Haha, what the hell was I saying?

1310
01:22:53,460 --> 01:22:55,290
I just recieved a sort of pep-talk just now

1311
01:22:55,350 --> 01:22:58,210
He was telling me, 'hey, don't laugh at stupid things'

1312
01:22:58,320 --> 01:22:59,540
Like a "pull it together"?

1313
01:22:59,060 --> 01:23:00,370
Yeah, like that.

1314
01:23:00,720 --> 01:23:01,920
This one really hurt..

1315
01:23:02,420 --> 01:23:04,270
Yeah I said that it had to of

1316
01:23:04,380 --> 01:23:06,860
It still hurts, my butt feels like its on fire

1317
01:23:08,190 --> 01:23:09,180
Huh? Does this mean...

1318
01:23:10,710 --> 01:23:12,320
That 'Downtown's Hamada' arrived?

1319
01:23:13,890 --> 01:23:15,220
Isn't just "Hamada" okay?

1320
01:23:15,530 --> 01:23:17,070
Do you have to add the "Downtown"?

1321
01:23:25,160 --> 01:23:26,490
That was safe!

1322
01:23:26,770 --> 01:23:27,810
I bet he's here!

1323
01:23:29,250 --> 01:23:30,230
That was even called out,

1324
01:23:31,530 --> 01:23:32,590
He's definitely here.

1325
01:23:34,210 --> 01:23:36,510
I saw right through it

1326
01:23:35,540 --> 01:23:36,990
And his way of beating is here!

1327
01:23:36,990 --> 01:23:38,090
He's definitely already here

1328
01:23:39,620 --> 01:23:40,850
He must of told them to hit harder

1329
01:23:41,040 --> 01:23:44,070
He's started giving directions concerning everything now.

1330
01:23:44,440 --> 01:23:49,810
At times like this, he directs like he has more than two hands.

1331
01:23:50,830 --> 01:23:52,080
So that means he's on top of everything

1332
01:23:52,090 --> 01:23:52,980
Yeah its incredible!

1333
01:23:55,270 --> 01:23:56,840
So he's here, finally...

1334
01:24:01,980 --> 01:24:04,440
Downtown's Hamada Enters

1335
01:24:03,580 --> 01:24:04,410
So he is here!

1336
01:24:04,280 --> 01:24:05,510
So he was here

1337
01:24:05,560 --> 01:24:06,920
I figured that out right away

1338
01:24:07,690 --> 01:24:10,500
So how is it? This time's Batsu game?

1339
01:24:09,860 --> 01:24:10,640
Its pretty intense

1340
01:24:10,720 --> 01:24:11,780
Yeah, amazing

1341
01:24:11,880 --> 01:24:12,550
Its pretty rough, its hard.

1342
01:24:12,720 --> 01:24:13,690
What part is rough?

1343
01:24:16,230 --> 01:24:17,210
What part is rough?

1344
01:24:22,570 --> 01:24:23,030
Huh?

1345
01:24:24,790 --> 01:24:25,940
That was mean

1346
01:24:27,220 --> 01:24:29,910
Sensei, that face looks like a chimpanzee

1347
01:24:29,990 --> 01:24:31,310
please stop making it

1348
01:24:33,120 --> 01:24:34,140
Endo, You laughed didn't you, just now!

1349
01:24:37,930 --> 01:24:39,710
so strict, You're too strict!

1350
01:24:42,100 --> 01:24:44,540
Ouch, That one had to hurt

1351
01:24:45,470 --> 01:24:47,180
So-- What's rough about it? What parts

1352
01:24:48,960 --> 01:24:52,060
Well it started early in the morning and...

1353
01:24:53,060 --> 01:24:53,680
Huh?

1354
01:24:58,440 --> 01:24:59,990
Come on... I told you

1355
01:25:02,110 --> 01:25:03,040
Whaaat?! are you serious?

1356
01:25:05,390 --> 01:25:06,320
Strict isn't it

1357
01:25:06,360 --> 01:25:07,270
just a second!

1358
01:25:07,350 --> 01:25:09,490
I'm going to die if we keep going like this

1359
01:25:09,590 --> 01:25:10,740
I said wait

1360
01:25:12,210 --> 01:25:13,930
just wait a little...

1361
01:25:13,160 --> 01:25:16,280
Sadistic Hamada laughing uncontrollably

1362
01:25:20,760 --> 01:25:23,040
Alright, lets change the mood and play a game!

1363
01:25:23,120 --> 01:25:23,990
I've had enough games...

1364
01:25:24,350 --> 01:25:25,130
I'm good, seriously

1365
01:25:25,190 --> 01:25:25,580
No more..

1366
01:25:25,700 --> 01:25:26,870
Its a really simple game. Look!

1367
01:25:27,040 --> 01:25:27,980
Super Ball

1368
01:25:28,440 --> 01:25:30,670
You've done it before, like this...remember?

1369
01:25:31,460 --> 01:25:32,240
yeah

1370
01:25:32,590 --> 01:25:34,720
Okay come over here

1371
01:25:34,960 --> 01:25:36,240
So we just do what you did?

1372
01:25:36,500 --> 01:25:38,350
Well, if you don't catch it there is a punishment.

1373
01:25:38,420 --> 01:25:39,400
Whaat!?

1374
01:25:39,930 --> 01:25:41,210
Only if we don't catch it there's a punishment?

1375
01:25:41,440 --> 01:25:42,890
Yes, if you don't catch it there's a punishment.

1376
01:25:42,970 --> 01:25:44,260
This is horrible

1377
01:25:44,360 --> 01:25:45,510
Try your best!

1378
01:25:45,850 --> 01:25:47,500
Lets start with Endo

1379
01:25:47,840 --> 01:25:48,540
Right here right?

1380
01:25:49,010 --> 01:25:50,030
So that line, got it

1381
01:26:03,360 --> 01:26:04,370
What was that?

1382
01:26:04,530 --> 01:26:05,840
Ahh this sucks

1383
01:26:12,510 --> 01:26:14,130
I couldn't stop laughing even though I was being hit

1384
01:26:17,020 --> 01:26:18,250
Isn't there a punishment?

1385
01:26:19,080 --> 01:26:20,420
Endo, your punishment, hurry up

1386
01:26:20,650 --> 01:26:21,750
That wasn't the punishment?!

1387
01:26:21,920 --> 01:26:22,560
No it wasn't.

1388
01:26:22,580 --> 01:26:23,860
That was the punishment for laughing

1389
01:26:23,920 --> 01:26:26,570
Ehh?! What is this? Why...

1390
01:26:26,790 --> 01:26:28,420
Because I said so

1391
01:26:30,150 --> 01:26:31,310
where?

1392
01:26:31,520 --> 01:26:32,480
Right here

1393
01:26:33,140 --> 01:26:34,630
Stand like this, right here

1394
01:26:37,340 --> 01:26:38,790
From here on it was hell

1395
01:26:43,180 --> 01:26:43,990
The start of a massacre

1396
01:26:45,700 --> 01:26:46,750
What's going on

1397
01:26:46,800 --> 01:26:47,820
Why are you guys here?

1398
01:26:47,980 --> 01:26:54,040
The punishment squad were overwhelmed by Hamada's awe inspiring-ness and came out.

1399
01:26:48,550 --> 01:26:50,590
What we didn't laugh

1400
01:26:50,720 --> 01:26:52,430
Nobody has laughed

1401
01:26:52,260 --> 01:26:52,760
Did you laugh?

1402
01:26:52,840 --> 01:26:53,800
I didn't laugh, I didn't laugh

1403
01:26:53,890 --> 01:26:54,700
He didn't laugh

1404
01:27:03,130 --> 01:27:04,570
This is messed up

1405
01:27:06,770 --> 01:27:07,850
Why?!

1406
01:27:09,400 --> 01:27:15,160
Even though he's been hit already, Tanaka getting grabbed again

1407
01:27:13,000 --> 01:27:14,180
What is that?

1408
01:27:15,360 --> 01:27:17,390
They should do their job right

1409
01:27:18,620 --> 01:27:19,900
It was all messed up

1410
01:27:21,340 --> 01:27:21,980
I wonder who's fault it was

1411
01:27:22,840 --> 01:27:23,890
What is this, Jungle Rules?

1412
01:27:24,230 --> 01:27:25,090
Yamachan

1413
01:27:25,150 --> 01:27:25,520
Yes?

1414
01:27:25,600 --> 01:27:26,150
your turn

1415
01:27:27,030 --> 01:27:27,840
Okay lets go Yamachan

1416
01:27:32,300 --> 01:27:34,180
Ball Catching-FAIL

1417
01:27:44,490 --> 01:27:46,280
The slap, after he failed, is fast

1418
01:27:47,440 --> 01:27:49,040
It was so sudden...

1419
01:27:52,750 --> 01:27:53,940
Endo's Laughing

1420
01:27:58,710 --> 01:28:00,400
Yes its too quick

1421
01:28:00,370 --> 01:28:02,320
We need some time to prepare ourselves for it

1422
01:28:04,130 --> 01:28:05,110
What was that?!

1423
01:28:06,370 --> 01:28:07,240
That's strange

1424
01:28:07,510 --> 01:28:08,690
He acted like twice was normal

1425
01:28:08,860 --> 01:28:09,740
Tanaka, you're up

1426
01:28:11,720 --> 01:28:15,000
Tanaka clearly aiming for Hamada

1427
01:28:24,300 --> 01:28:27,000
You little.. catch it!

1428
01:28:27,230 --> 01:28:28,720
You meant to do that didn't you

1429
01:28:35,010 --> 01:28:37,750
He was completely aiming for you just then

1430
01:28:36,150 --> 01:28:36,850
were you?

1431
01:28:36,920 --> 01:28:37,730
No

1432
01:28:43,650 --> 01:28:45,250
Well, if you weren't able to catch it, there's a punishment

1433
01:28:50,370 --> 01:28:52,200
You had such a scared look on your face after you didn't catch it

1434
01:28:52,320 --> 01:28:53,740
Okey, Matsumoto

1435
01:28:53,740 --> 01:28:54,640
Ok

1436
01:28:57,300 --> 01:28:59,020
Ball Catching-FAIL

1437
01:29:05,940 --> 01:29:07,640
Alright, go to your seats

1438
01:29:07,890 --> 01:29:13,360
The 4 of them hurrying to their seats

1439
01:29:15,390 --> 01:29:22,170
It seems like Takeda Sensei has something he forgot to do last period so...

1440
01:29:22,420 --> 01:29:28,590
Good morning, Hi, How are ya

1441
01:29:24,900 --> 01:29:29,350
Hori (Takeda) Sensei appears again

1442
01:29:28,800 --> 01:29:30,200
Sorry about this

1443
01:29:30,340 --> 01:29:33,530
No no, I'm sorry about making you put up with me over and over

1444
01:29:34,090 --> 01:29:35,860
I forgot about something I was supposed to teach you

1445
01:29:35,930 --> 01:29:36,890
Yeah, that's right

1446
01:29:37,140 --> 01:29:39,110
I had some excercises I was going to have them do

1447
01:29:38,480 --> 01:29:39,280
Right right right...

1448
01:29:39,340 --> 01:29:40,900
This is what your teacher forgot

1449
01:29:40,950 --> 01:29:44,580
I just taught it, "Things they would NEVER say"

1450
01:29:44,650 --> 01:29:46,760
And I'll give you another example

1451
01:29:47,860 --> 01:29:50,960
Something Beat Takeshi would never say...

1452
01:29:47,860 --> 01:29:53,860
Beat Takeshi (Kitano Takeshi) is a famous comedian (also known as one of the comedy Big 3).

1453
01:29:54,540 --> 01:29:55,670
Dankan, Thank you!

1454
01:29:54,540 --> 01:29:59,540
Dankan is a Japanese stand-up comedian, actor, writer, and filmmaker. He is a member of Office Kitano--which was founded by Beat Takeshi.

1455
01:30:05,530 --> 01:30:06,700
I was thinking, "he might say that..."

1456
01:30:10,200 --> 01:30:13,230
I thought well he might say that but...

1457
01:30:13,580 --> 01:30:16,310
If he did he'd be a fresh new Takeshi

1458
01:30:16,570 --> 01:30:18,440
Endo

1459
01:30:18,600 --> 01:30:19,390
Huh?

1460
01:30:23,990 --> 01:30:27,270
I wonder if it's okay? I think so...Jerk

1461
01:30:27,710 --> 01:30:29,240
Okay, Yamasaki

1462
01:30:30,260 --> 01:30:30,950
something he wouldn't say?

1463
01:30:31,150 --> 01:30:32,290
he would never say...

1464
01:30:34,450 --> 01:30:37,460
Dankan, you dirty rat

1465
01:30:43,020 --> 01:30:45,560
What was that? He would definitly say that

1466
01:30:53,980 --> 01:30:55,520
That hurt, definitely hurt

1467
01:30:55,850 --> 01:30:56,780
Okay, Yamasaki

1468
01:30:56,860 --> 01:30:57,480
What?!

1469
01:30:59,800 --> 01:31:00,370
Yamasaki

1470
01:31:03,390 --> 01:31:07,620
Dankan, Good Night

1471
01:31:11,460 --> 01:31:12,560
Oh, this is hopeless

1472
01:31:14,300 --> 01:31:15,820
"Dankan" gets me everytime

1473
01:31:16,360 --> 01:31:17,610
Yeah, Takeshi probably wouldn't of said that...

1474
01:31:18,670 --> 01:31:21,440
Ahhouch, Please stop saying Dankan

1475
01:31:23,010 --> 01:31:23,780
Okay, Yamasaki

1476
01:31:23,940 --> 01:31:24,430
Wha-?!

1477
01:31:26,940 --> 01:31:29,080
Me? Shouldn't it be Endo next?

1478
01:31:28,440 --> 01:31:29,450
Yamasaki

1479
01:31:31,860 --> 01:31:35,690
Dankan, have a croquette

1480
01:31:36,750 --> 01:31:38,110
Please stop saying Dankan...

1481
01:31:38,300 --> 01:31:42,380
I'm hopeless when it comes to "Dankan"

1482
01:31:43,420 --> 01:31:45,800
I can handle anything except "Dankan"

1483
01:31:47,800 --> 01:31:49,800
Did you even know what you were going to say?

1484
01:31:49,560 --> 01:31:51,460
Have a Croquette

1485
01:31:51,840 --> 01:31:53,890
That one hurt didn't it Tanaka

1486
01:31:57,140 --> 01:31:59,040
Thank you very much, sensei.

1487
01:32:02,820 --> 01:32:05,100
The teacher looks like the original, right?

1488
01:32:06,200 --> 01:32:07,680
Did you like this class?

1489
01:32:07,680 --> 01:32:10,240
It needs to be fun, right?

1490
01:32:13,260 --> 01:32:16,290
"It's time for the library to open."

1491
01:32:16,290 --> 01:32:20,230
"Students are free to come and borrow books."

1492
01:32:20,230 --> 01:32:24,240
So everyone? How about borrowing books before you go home?

1493
01:32:24,660 --> 01:32:27,120
Okay? There are surely books that will interest you.

1494
01:32:27,640 --> 01:32:28,680
Let's go.

1495
01:32:28,680 --> 01:32:30,580
Do we have to borrow books?

1496
01:32:31,440 --> 01:32:32,640
Let's go quickly to the library!

1497
01:32:32,640 --> 01:32:33,960
Isn't that thing?

1498
01:32:40,620 --> 01:32:44,220
Stay silent in the library.

1499
01:32:48,930 --> 01:32:51,660
No speaking

1500
01:32:48,930 --> 01:32:52,760
It's a silent library, so don't talk too loud.

1501
01:32:53,660 --> 01:32:54,760
Do you understood?

1502
01:32:54,760 --> 01:33:00,540
Only one of these cards is a bad card.

1503
01:33:00,540 --> 01:33:03,080
Well, take a random one.

1504
01:33:01,200 --> 01:33:06,640
Whoever draws the card with the lips receives the punishment

1505
01:33:07,100 --> 01:33:09,120
Ready? Go!

1506
01:33:10,750 --> 01:33:13,980
Tanaka takes the punishment

1507
01:33:11,360 --> 01:33:13,980
Bad luck Tanaka, you drew the card with the lips.

1508
01:33:13,980 --> 01:33:16,320
Here is Tanaka's punishment!

1509
01:33:17,950 --> 01:33:19,940
THAI KICK

1510
01:33:22,360 --> 01:33:24,000
It's getting worse!

1511
01:33:24,830 --> 01:33:27,960
It's getting worse! Is that possible?

1512
01:33:27,960 --> 01:33:29,530
It's getting worse! Is that possible?

1513
01:33:29,530 --> 01:33:31,060
Tanaka, come over here.

1514
01:33:31,060 --> 01:33:34,340
It must be a nightmare!

1515
01:33:37,840 --> 01:33:39,510
Shhhhh don't speak!

1516
01:33:43,700 --> 01:33:45,850
Tanaka, don't say anything!

1517
01:33:46,600 --> 01:33:47,500
Let's go.

1518
01:33:47,900 --> 01:33:49,140
Ready? Go!

1519
01:33:51,090 --> 01:33:53,720
Matsumoto takes the punishment

1520
01:33:52,640 --> 01:33:54,500
For Matsumoto san, it will be...

1521
01:33:54,500 --> 01:33:55,220
This !

1522
01:33:56,760 --> 01:33:58,290
Tickling Man

1523
01:33:59,220 --> 01:34:00,200
They are there!

1524
01:34:21,580 --> 01:34:22,320
Please!

1525
01:34:28,360 --> 01:34:31,260
It's over~!

1526
01:34:33,880 --> 01:34:35,000
What are you laughing at ?

1527
01:34:35,700 --> 01:34:40,200
A moth on Tanaka's face...

1528
01:34:44,120 --> 01:34:46,040
Good Yama-chan, you accept it like a man!

1529
01:34:51,110 --> 01:34:57,870
After the devil like Hamadas time is over, finally a breath of relief..

1530
01:34:51,110 --> 01:34:57,870
But then Matsumoto notices something.

1531
01:34:58,270 --> 01:35:02,500
Aren't they being soft on Yamasaki? That was so clear.

1532
01:35:02,800 --> 01:35:05,070
If it had been me it'd definitely been ~babaan (out).

1533
01:35:09,750 --> 01:35:14,310
They are probably in the middle of planning and not watching the monitor.

1534
01:35:14,860 --> 01:35:15,310
Ah I see

1535
01:35:17,230 --> 01:35:20,310
Hamada probably has them all gathered up

1536
01:35:20,310 --> 01:35:21,960
"What should we do?" Kinda planning

1537
01:35:21,960 --> 01:35:23,960
Try laughing and you'll see

1538
01:35:23,960 --> 01:35:25,110
It's definitely safe

1539
01:35:25,110 --> 01:35:26,760
Try laughing

1540
01:35:26,760 --> 01:35:28,160
No no it's no use if I do it

1541
01:35:28,360 --> 01:35:34,000
If you get ~babaan (called out) I'll look at the situation and laugh

1542
01:35:34,000 --> 01:35:37,000
Ah then it can be called even

1543
01:35:37,000 --> 01:35:38,200
It's definitely safe

1544
01:35:38,200 --> 01:35:39,300
Definitely safe

1545
01:35:46,750 --> 01:35:54,800
It's safe it's safe it's safe...Now's your only chance (to laugh freely).

1546
01:36:14,900 --> 01:36:15,900
No idea

1547
01:36:15,900 --> 01:36:19,200
Why aren't you laughing?   Weren't you going to laugh if someone gets called out?

1548
01:36:19,400 --> 01:36:22,970
That was meant for Saki(Yamasaki) only

1549
01:36:23,200 --> 01:36:28,170
I meant Yamasakis try only

1550
01:36:28,070 --> 01:36:28,870
I thought the same

1551
01:36:28,870 --> 01:36:31,970
Maybe Yamasakis CCD is broken or they are being soft on him

1552
01:36:34,570 --> 01:36:35,770
Endo try it out

1553
01:36:35,920 --> 01:36:36,970
No way

1554
01:36:37,120 --> 01:36:39,500
But it's probably the CCD (that's broken).. Maybe

1555
01:36:39,520 --> 01:36:45,250
Endo try it.. It's definitely safe, definitely.. I'm confident it's safe.

1556
01:36:45,310 --> 01:36:51,170
If it's safe, would you mind switching places with me for the time being?

1557
01:36:51,170 --> 01:36:52,950
Ah! Kinda as a reward for taking the risk

1558
01:36:53,350 --> 01:36:54,150
That's ok

1559
01:36:54,250 --> 01:36:57,530
If it's not safe they are being too soft on Yamasaki

1560
01:36:57,870 --> 01:36:59,330
That's right

1561
01:36:58,330 --> 01:37:00,330
That's definitely wrong

1562
01:37:00,330 --> 01:37:02,330
If this is safe, please switch with me

1563
01:37:01,870 --> 01:37:02,330
Sure

1564
01:37:13,330 --> 01:37:14,330
They are watching

1565
01:37:20,960 --> 01:37:27,430
Getting punished more than ever following Hamadas arrival, finally a break for the four of them

1566
01:37:27,750 --> 01:37:30,030
Washing away their exhaustion

1567
01:37:34,330 --> 01:37:41,030
But after this, laughter triggering assasins will be appearing one after one. The punishment game is far from over.

1568
01:37:44,230 --> 01:37:47,030
You guys noticed directly, "oh he's here"

1569
01:37:48,030 --> 01:37:56,030
After your arrival it got a lot stricter and we got beaten harder

1570
01:37:58,030 --> 01:38:09,030
After watching this I've realized, we aren't equal at all... As if I'm 4 years younger.. 5 years older sempai.

1571
01:38:07,030 --> 01:38:08,030
5 years older sempai

1572
01:38:12,030 --> 01:38:17,030
21:00, the five of them start talking about their school years.

1573
01:38:18,480 --> 01:38:21,180
The 4 students seem to be in great shape.

1574
01:38:21,600 --> 01:38:23,620
You know it's only the female mosquito that bites?

1575
01:38:23,620 --> 01:38:24,280
Yes.

1576
01:38:24,280 --> 01:38:25,520
I think so.

1577
01:38:29,300 --> 01:38:33,400
Our school has many enthusiastic students.

1578
01:38:33,400 --> 01:38:35,440
Even this late, they take care of their club.

1579
01:38:35,440 --> 01:38:36,280
Huh?

1580
01:38:37,370 --> 01:38:39,540
How about see what they do?

1581
01:38:39,660 --> 01:38:41,520
Even this late!?

1582
01:38:46,060 --> 01:38:46,820
This way.

1583
01:38:47,000 --> 01:38:49,000
It smells like curry.

1584
01:38:48,140 --> 01:38:49,360
It smells good!

1585
01:38:57,890 --> 01:39:01,060
"A sneaky woman"
Sharam Q

1586
01:38:58,930 --> 01:39:02,570
Matsumoto pinches his
butt to stop from laughing

1587
01:39:06,040 --> 01:39:07,720
Who can resist that!?

1588
01:39:06,940 --> 01:39:18,350
Tsuntsuku

1589
01:39:07,720 --> 01:39:09,460
It was dangerous!

1590
01:39:12,000 --> 01:39:13,920
It's totally him!

1591
01:39:15,160 --> 01:39:18,350
This imitation still had an impact on us!

1592
01:39:25,440 --> 01:39:27,960
I'm the only one who thinks it's funny!?

1593
01:39:56,690 --> 01:40:00,320
It was perfect, he is like him!

1594
01:39:59,620 --> 01:40:04,200
And finally, here is the last show.

1595
01:40:04,440 --> 01:40:05,130
Come !

1596
01:40:16,210 --> 01:40:23,610
Tajima Rapper
(Tajima Yuichi Manager)

1597
01:40:23,610 --> 01:40:28,150
"My name is Tajima Yuichi, number one bad boy in Yoshimoto"

1598
01:40:28,150 --> 01:40:32,290
"I want you hear my rapping skills which I'm so proud of, LISTEN!"

1599
01:40:37,190 --> 01:40:41,830
"Hamada is awesome, he's a great man.
He's the number one handsome guy in this business."

1600
01:40:41,830 --> 01:40:44,700
"Even if sometimes it can be ha... harsh."

1601
01:40:50,970 --> 01:40:53,440
"His lips are in great shape!"

1602
01:40:53,440 --> 01:40:54,960
What does that means?

1603
01:40:57,480 --> 01:40:59,050
I don't understand anything!

1604
01:41:04,080 --> 01:41:06,780
The robot dance had nothing to do there!

1605
01:41:18,720 --> 01:41:20,160
Scary!

1606
01:41:28,560 --> 01:41:31,320
So he did it... His Tajima's rap...

1607
01:41:33,420 --> 01:41:35,420
This is where the real game starts, isn't it?

1608
01:41:36,140 --> 01:41:38,620
This is the first time I've ever been at school this late

1609
01:41:39,620 --> 01:41:40,420
That's true

1610
01:41:42,360 --> 01:41:44,420
Would you like to return to high school?

1611
01:41:45,720 --> 01:41:51,140
High school? Well.. High school was quite fun

1612
01:41:51,520 --> 01:41:53,220
High school was really funny

1613
01:41:53,520 --> 01:42:02,420
During the 34 years I've lived, 2nd year of high school was the most fun or 2nd most fun year.

1614
01:42:01,220 --> 01:42:02,220
Same here

1615
01:42:03,220 --> 01:42:04,220
2nd year was fun

1616
01:42:04,220 --> 01:42:05,220
Everyone thinks so too?

1617
01:42:05,220 --> 01:42:06,220
Yup 2nd

1618
01:42:06,220 --> 01:42:08,220
Yea 2nd was fun

1619
01:42:08,220 --> 01:42:10,140
You're laughing like normal

1620
01:42:12,820 --> 01:42:13,820
I was laughing?

1621
01:42:13,620 --> 01:42:14,820
He was laughing normally

1622
01:42:18,140 --> 01:42:19,140
Definitely out

1623
01:42:20,140 --> 01:42:21,140
You'll get slapped for sure

1624
01:42:21,140 --> 01:42:23,140
Recalling nostalgic fun times

1625
01:42:23,370 --> 01:42:26,680
A normal overflowing affectionate smile

1626
01:42:26,700 --> 01:42:28,360
Amazing

1627
01:42:40,140 --> 01:42:42,340
How many friends did you have?

1628
01:42:42,340 --> 01:42:47,340
I still meet up with 3 of them

1629
01:42:47,340 --> 01:42:49,340
Isn't that too few?

1630
01:42:49,340 --> 01:42:50,340
I had a lot

1631
01:42:51,140 --> 01:42:52,140
You mean very close?

1632
01:42:52,140 --> 01:42:53,640
Aah I understand

1633
01:42:52,140 --> 01:42:57,380
Yup close friends. Other than them I had like 20 people around.

1634
01:42:58,140 --> 01:43:00,540
20 I can't really believe

1635
01:43:00,540 --> 01:43:04,340
I was in the Kendo club, there where a lot of people

1636
01:43:05,140 --> 01:43:09,340
That's club members, I mean real friends

1637
01:43:10,140 --> 01:43:10,640
But..

1638
01:43:10,640 --> 01:43:11,440
Who?

1639
01:43:11,850 --> 01:43:17,110
Mochan. Mochan and Sasagish and..

1640
01:43:17,110 --> 01:43:17,480
Huh?

1641
01:43:17,480 --> 01:43:18,510
Sasagish

1642
01:43:25,690 --> 01:43:26,900
Sasagish..

1643
01:43:27,350 --> 01:43:31,690
Because you don't know them it somehow becomes funny

1644
01:43:32,750 --> 01:43:33,610
That slap hurt

1645
01:43:35,790 --> 01:43:38,780
My ass is really starting to hurt

1646
01:43:38,780 --> 01:43:40,530
Sasagish and?

1647
01:43:40,530 --> 01:43:44,290
Mochan and Sasagish and.. Kuroyanagi

1648
01:43:50,440 --> 01:43:53,190
About 8 people

1649
01:43:53,190 --> 01:43:56,150
You haven't mentioned all 8 yet

1650
01:43:57,180 --> 01:43:58,820
What was your nickname?

1651
01:43:59,450 --> 01:44:00,710
Matsun

1652
01:44:01,090 --> 01:44:01,860
The whole time?

1653
01:44:03,610 --> 01:44:06,690
During high school they used to call me potato

1654
01:44:08,320 --> 01:44:09,730
Why the hell?

1655
01:44:19,600 --> 01:44:21,270
That's unfair

1656
01:44:21,900 --> 01:44:23,270
For real

1657
01:44:30,030 --> 01:44:31,170
Why'd they call you that?

1658
01:44:31,520 --> 01:44:33,210
My head is uneven

1659
01:44:36,140 --> 01:44:37,890
Whoa it really is

1660
01:44:37,830 --> 01:44:39,500
My head is really strange

1661
01:44:40,360 --> 01:44:46,590
Once during high school there was a time they called me rice cracker

1662
01:44:53,710 --> 01:44:57,500
Eh? Because of your skin color?

1663
01:45:04,420 --> 01:45:10,590
22:00 A pleasant announcement for the 4 who haven't eaten anything since lunch

1664
01:45:18,480 --> 01:45:25,290
You guys are really pathetic. Dinner is ready so get moving to the gym

1665
01:45:25,290 --> 01:45:27,290
Dinner

1666
01:45:27,670 --> 01:45:32,380
you guys really are pathetic.. Let's go

1667
01:45:35,110 --> 01:45:37,350
Smells good

1668
01:45:37,350 --> 01:45:38,980
Aaah as expected

1669
01:45:38,980 --> 01:45:42,480
You guys line up too

1670
01:45:42,480 --> 01:45:44,930
Work hard, you can do it

1671
01:45:45,930 --> 01:45:48,950
Ishihara Yujiro and Actors from
Ishihara Agency are serving curried rice for Dinner

1672
01:45:55,950 --> 01:45:59,340
So that's how it is

1673
01:46:03,140 --> 01:46:23,140
"from a Detective Drama"

1674
01:46:03,140 --> 01:46:23,140

01:46:03,140 --> 01:46:23,140
GNT Producers

01:46:03,140 --> 01:46:23,140
Nakamura   Suga   Yutaro

1677
01:46:06,140 --> 01:46:08,140
Seems like he's going to call out to us

1678
01:46:11,140 --> 01:46:15,140
Curry suits you, good luck

1679
01:46:15,790 --> 01:46:19,890
Next. Good of you for coming.

1680
01:46:19,890 --> 01:46:21,360
Why is he talking so arrogantly?

1681
01:46:21,360 --> 01:46:24,660
Do you like curry?

1682
01:46:31,400 --> 01:46:34,140
Want me to add some of this?

1683
01:46:50,980 --> 01:46:58,730
Eat up eat up. You seem to be really energetic. Anyone want some more?

1684
01:46:58,730 --> 01:47:00,200
They're staring at us

1685
01:47:00,200 --> 01:47:02,980
Daimon is amazing

1686
01:47:06,770 --> 01:47:09,040
Peaceful isn't it chief?

1687
01:47:10,680 --> 01:47:13,000
Dan-Cho! we have a situation !

1688
01:47:13,170 --> 01:47:13,890
What's happened?

1689
01:47:18,050 --> 01:47:28,560
What's wrong? A case?... Dan-Cho(Daimon), Hato!
Let's go!

1690
01:47:25,560 --> 01:47:29,390
Kogure and his men
rush to the Crime Scene with Haste!!

1691
01:47:29,390 --> 01:47:31,830
all right! I'll leave this up to you.

1692
01:47:39,040 --> 01:47:40,160
What the hell?

1693
01:47:51,470 --> 01:47:53,450
That one seemed to have hurt

1694
01:48:14,140 --> 01:48:21,450
Itaos Wife

1695
01:48:17,510 --> 01:48:22,650
she's not his wife actually.

1696
01:48:54,720 --> 01:48:56,410
She gives off a smell of money

1697
01:48:56,410 --> 01:48:57,620
She really does

1698
01:48:57,620 --> 01:48:59,620
I wonder why

1699
01:49:00,630 --> 01:49:02,180
Like (casino) chips

1700
01:49:01,720 --> 01:49:03,730
Smell of (casino) chips right?

1701
01:49:16,530 --> 01:49:18,600
She really knows lots of dance styles

1702
01:49:42,310 --> 01:49:49,260
What kind of dance is this!? Enough already!

1703
01:49:57,590 --> 01:49:58,820
What was that?

1704
01:50:05,340 --> 01:50:07,120
That was amazing

1705
01:50:07,120 --> 01:50:08,070
Please let it be over

1706
01:50:08,070 --> 01:50:11,650
Next time she comes I won't laugh any more for sure

1707
01:50:26,840 --> 01:50:28,970
What's up with her repertoire of styles?

1708
01:50:40,680 --> 01:50:43,720
They switched the damn song

1709
01:50:47,620 --> 01:50:49,820
It hurts too much with these pants!

1710
01:50:51,060 --> 01:50:52,600
She is really good at it.

1711
01:51:22,900 --> 01:51:23,980
Well done!

1712
01:51:24,180 --> 01:51:26,540
What is this sad expression!?

1713
01:51:26,540 --> 01:51:28,340
You won.

1714
01:51:28,340 --> 01:51:30,780
Stop making that sad face!

1715
01:51:31,020 --> 01:51:32,660
Stop making that face!

1716
01:51:32,660 --> 01:51:33,680
It's boring...

1717
01:51:37,960 --> 01:51:39,590
We understood, you can stop!

1718
01:51:44,020 --> 01:51:45,380
Do not suddenly become happy!

1719
01:51:58,060 --> 01:52:00,120
It was impressive.

1720
01:52:00,520 --> 01:52:02,300
Wait, I can't take it anymore.

1721
01:52:08,280 --> 01:52:10,020
Give me a break, I'm in pain!

1722
01:52:12,750 --> 01:52:15,490
This woman is incredible.

1723
01:52:15,900 --> 01:52:23,730
23:00 14hours into the batsu game. Finally the time for some rest has arrived.

1724
01:52:24,820 --> 01:52:29,040
Futons have been prepared so you can get some sleep

1725
01:52:30,220 --> 01:52:31,690
Whoa futons

1726
01:52:31,690 --> 01:52:33,320
Argh it's hot

1727
01:52:36,190 --> 01:52:37,740
It's hot

1728
01:52:39,350 --> 01:52:42,390
Finally peace for the four

1729
01:52:42,620 --> 01:52:45,470
But, someone is plotting to ruin it

1730
01:52:47,040 --> 01:52:53,710
In the planning headquarters sits the Demon leader Hamada ready to torment the four with further traps

1731
01:52:54,110 --> 01:52:57,410
I want to torture them with some silly trick

1732
01:53:01,970 --> 01:53:06,850
Tonight is crucial

1733
01:53:04,410 --> 01:53:11,410
Konya ga Yamada

1734
01:53:06,850 --> 01:53:08,860
it showed up

1735
01:53:08,060 --> 01:53:08,920
It did

1736
01:53:08,920 --> 01:53:10,180
Tonight is crucial

1737
01:53:12,420 --> 01:53:14,890
Tonight is crucial

1738
01:53:22,900 --> 01:53:25,400
Tonight is crucia~l

1739
01:53:28,480 --> 01:53:32,900
he was singing off sync.

1740
01:53:37,900 --> 01:53:39,900
they told me that they repeated it like forever.

1741
01:53:39,580 --> 01:53:41,820
Tonight is crucia~l

1742
01:53:54,420 --> 01:53:55,940
What the hell!?

1743
01:53:55,940 --> 01:53:57,940
Tonight is crucia~l

1744
01:54:04,940 --> 01:54:07,040
You don't intend to let us sleep!

1745
01:54:08,040 --> 01:54:10,980
Hamada Joins the Bamboo sword Army

1746
01:54:08,040 --> 01:54:11,040
Who and who?

1747
01:54:10,980 --> 01:54:13,040
Ok, I'll get Endo

1748
01:54:13,580 --> 01:54:14,780
way to persistent!

1749
01:54:19,480 --> 01:54:20,080
Damn it!

1750
01:54:21,010 --> 01:54:23,040
and I thought that I could really sleep...

1751
01:54:36,040 --> 01:54:37,040
Anyone would be surprised at that!

1752
01:54:37,040 --> 01:54:39,040
what was that?

1753
01:54:39,040 --> 01:54:41,040
He Kicked me! seriously. It hurts

1754
01:54:49,380 --> 01:54:52,880
Sadistic Hamada couldn't help
but be amused

1755
01:54:56,680 --> 01:54:57,880
you went to sleep right after that, Endo
--Yea you did!

1756
01:54:57,880 --> 01:54:59,040
I couldn't pick my self up.

1757
01:55:01,040 --> 01:55:03,040
you didn't move at all.

1758
01:55:07,040 --> 01:55:09,040
you like a dead fish!

1759
01:55:19,040 --> 01:55:20,240
Tonight is crucia~l

1760
01:55:36,240 --> 01:55:38,040
this was a real torture.

1761
01:55:46,040 --> 01:55:48,240
Tonight is crucia~l

1762
01:55:54,380 --> 01:55:56,240
Endo looks nearly dead
--oh yes I was!

1763
01:55:56,240 --> 01:55:59,240
Chiaki!(Endo's Wife) I love you!

1764
01:56:02,540 --> 01:56:05,240
Chiaki! I love you!

1765
01:56:12,240 --> 01:56:13,440
Was it Hamada-san again ?

1766
01:56:13,440 --> 01:56:15,040
I think It was me again, I kicked you in the butt

1767
01:56:15,040 --> 01:56:18,380
It was...I think...

1768
01:56:19,380 --> 01:56:21,040
Sadistic Hamada Again.

1769
01:56:19,380 --> 01:56:21,040
it was me

1770
01:56:28,040 --> 01:56:30,040
This is so wrong!

1771
01:56:32,040 --> 01:56:33,040
They noticed that it was me?

1772
01:56:35,040 --> 01:56:39,040
There is no one else around who'd do that

1773
01:56:41,040 --> 01:56:43,040
There is no way we can sleep like this!

1774
01:56:45,040 --> 01:56:48,040
0:30 15hours have passed

1775
01:56:51,040 --> 01:56:57,040
After finally having escaped the evil Hamada and fallen asleep, the four receive a new trial.

1776
01:57:04,040 --> 01:57:05,040
Wake up!

1777
01:57:08,040 --> 01:57:09,040
Everyone get up!

1778
01:57:09,040 --> 01:57:19,040
Actually, in the schools gym, it's said a scary ghost appears

1779
01:57:20,040 --> 01:57:23,040
Can you guys check if it's true?

1780
01:57:25,040 --> 01:57:35,040
If you do meet the ghost, ask what you as comedians should do from now on

1781
01:57:38,040 --> 01:57:39,040
First up is Matsumoto

1782
01:57:43,040 --> 01:57:45,040
Alone?

1783
01:57:45,040 --> 01:57:46,040
Alone

1784
01:58:19,040 --> 01:58:22,040
Yamada Hanako in the toilet

1785
01:58:25,040 --> 01:58:30,710
They told me to stay here for a while and I've been here all the time, need anything?

1786
01:58:31,860 --> 01:58:33,410
What are you doing here?

1787
01:58:33,410 --> 01:58:50,890
It's like they told me to stay here and like stuff. Saying people will be coming for like advise like and stuff like so you should like stay here.. So?

1788
01:58:33,410 --> 01:58:50,890
Note: Yes she's really talking in an annoyingly messed up way. Ex. Adding 'um' or 'hm' between every word.

1789
01:58:55,460 --> 01:59:08,750
Like wine is good and like Hamada came and like said drink this drink this and like yeh

1790
01:59:10,300 --> 01:59:16,900
Like I was told like french wine is good and like ihihihihi

1791
01:59:23,510 --> 01:59:29,560
Who are you? Wait a bit

1792
01:59:33,440 --> 01:59:39,240
What's this? Then like there aren't enough drinks like

1793
01:59:39,240 --> 01:59:40,440
You drink too much

1794
01:59:40,440 --> 01:59:42,570
I don't drink too much it's just red wine

1795
01:59:51,810 --> 01:59:58,560
Like listen... Like a point or something like that is unimportant

1796
01:59:53,510 --> 01:59:55,400
I don't get the point of this

1797
02:00:05,970 --> 02:00:08,980
Waah wait someone that big!

1798
02:00:13,690 --> 02:00:14,980
Listen!

1799
02:00:14,980 --> 02:00:19,290
Aaah no I don't want to hear anymore!

1800
02:00:21,070 --> 02:00:30,000
Like red like french wine and like they let me drink it like

1801
02:00:24,280 --> 02:00:25,830
Hell has arrived

1802
02:00:29,680 --> 02:00:31,320
It'd be better if you slept and drank some water

1803
02:00:31,320 --> 02:00:41,310
Like it's not about water it's like having fun with Downtown and like Hamada came

1804
02:00:41,310 --> 02:00:45,240
I heard I heard you've already told me about Hamada!

1805
02:00:45,240 --> 02:00:47,240
It's enough already spare me!

1806
02:00:52,130 --> 02:00:55,550
Ah no more!

1807
02:00:53,390 --> 02:00:59,480
Hamada like was here and like.. Listen to me

1808
02:01:02,550 --> 02:01:09,560
It's pure hell! The worst! The worst! The worst!

1809
02:01:10,700 --> 02:01:20,030
You really better prepare yourself mentally or... Anyway just go

Good morning. Like I don't get it either but like I got to drink and some guys would be coming and like

1815
02:01:58,880 --> 02:02:00,710
Well for now let's sit down

1819
02:02:16,590 --> 02:02:19,000

I like don't really like get it either but like

1821
02:02:28,560 --> 02:02:34,700
Ah Endo has quite an 'ah' atmosphere going on

1822
02:02:35,160 --> 02:02:37,550
Excuse me, I'd like to go to the bathroom

1823
02:02:38,120 --> 02:02:41,800
Is there a bathroom around here?

1824
02:02:41,800 --> 02:02:43,800
The bathroom is right there

1825
02:02:48,250 --> 02:02:50,120
Could you call the staff?

1826
02:02:50,120 --> 02:02:51,500

1827
02:02:51,500 --> 02:02:55,890
Thank you. Staff people, I'd like to go to the bathroom

1828
02:02:57,870 --> 02:03:03,360

02:03:03,360 --> 02:03:05,080
A real ghost

1830
02:03:05,080 --> 02:03:06,000
A real ghost?

1831
02:03:06,000 --> 02:03:06,510
Scary for real

1832
02:03:07,260 --> 02:03:12,660
Endo, Matsumoto! You've said too much. Don't you understand the situation?

1833
02:03:14,210 --> 02:03:22,760
Listen, sit! Like french wine is good and stuff like ihihihihi

1834
02:03:22,760 --> 02:03:32,640
Something like, something like being here the whole time is like, wrong and like

1835
02:03:38,550 --> 02:03:40,880
Big sister, big sister

1836
02:03:40,880 --> 02:03:42,880
I'm not big sister

1837
02:03:47,540 --> 02:03:50,090
We don't have that kind of relationship

1838
02:03:55,230 --> 02:03:59,280
Where?  Excuse me!

1839
02:04:15,040 --> 02:04:18,630
Like I was told to be here and like

1840
02:04:18,630 --> 02:04:19,430
This is the wrong place

1841
02:04:19,430 --> 02:04:21,790
Like this is the right place. Want some wine?

1842
02:04:22,020 --> 02:04:24,030
Eh? I don't really need any

1843
02:04:24,030 --> 02:04:33,730
Like french wine is good and stuff and like they said they'll bring some but like I think I'm being tricked

1844
02:04:33,730 --> 02:04:35,970
This conversations is totally..

1845
02:04:35,970 --> 02:04:41,680
It's like not wrong or something. Like french wine is good

1846
02:04:41,680 --> 02:04:45,930
Eh stop that

1847
02:04:48,490 --> 02:04:52,990
Ouch! I just like hit my head

1848
02:04:59,940 --> 02:05:05,770
She's pulling on my leg

1849
02:05:06,800 --> 02:05:09,410
That kind of reaction is good

1850
02:05:09,410 --> 02:05:13,260
Ah! Wait! Ouch!

1851
02:05:15,500 --> 02:05:18,030
Don't need the same reaction twice

1852
02:05:26,610 --> 02:05:29,020
That was scary

1853
02:05:29,020 --> 02:05:30,690
Yamasaki's face expression is creepy.

1854
02:05:32,040 --> 02:05:33,410
This is wrong

1855
02:05:33,410 --> 02:05:35,410
Completely wrong

1856
02:05:35,410 --> 02:05:36,310
Scary right?

1857
02:05:36,310 --> 02:05:38,310
I was really scared

1858
02:05:38,310 --> 02:05:42,490
It's time for High Schoolers to sleep

1859
02:05:43,320 --> 02:05:44,490
Could you go to sleep?

1860
02:05:51,870 --> 02:05:54,340
For how long are you going to stay awake?!

1861
02:05:54,340 --> 02:05:55,640
I have no idea what time it is.

1862
02:05:54,830 --> 02:05:57,460
We don't even know how many hours have passed since the start.

1863
02:05:55,640 --> 02:06:00,720
The 4 do not know what time it is because there is no clock in the class

1864
02:05:58,310 --> 02:05:59,650
Can I say something?

1865
02:06:00,920 --> 02:06:03,450
If it is past midnight...

1866
02:06:06,850 --> 02:06:09,560
... this is my birthday

1867
02:06:09,660 --> 02:06:16,630
1:13 am

1868
02:06:17,200 --> 02:06:19,670
But I don't even know... If it's my birthday or not.

1869
02:06:19,670 --> 02:06:22,700
But I don't even know... If it's my birthday or not.

1870
02:06:23,280 --> 02:06:25,180
This is hard.

1871
02:06:27,280 --> 02:06:30,280
Happy Birthday.

1872
02:06:30,280 --> 02:06:31,540
Happy Birthday.

1873
02:06:32,140 --> 02:06:33,620
Happy Birthday.

1874
02:06:33,450 --> 02:06:35,680
"Happy Birthday, Matsumoto."

1875
02:06:35,680 --> 02:06:36,720
"Hurry to sleep."

1876
02:06:42,200 --> 02:06:43,880
This is...

1877
02:06:44,560 --> 02:06:46,640
This is crazy!

1878
02:06:45,360 --> 02:06:50,870
It was a long time ago that Matsumoto was 42

1879
02:06:47,160 --> 02:06:49,120
No, no, no !

1880
02:06:56,240 --> 02:06:58,310
"Happy Birthday, Matsumoto."

1881
02:06:58,310 --> 02:06:59,970
"Hurry to sleep."

1882
02:06:59,970 --> 02:07:02,210
"Matsumoto OUT"

1883
02:07:02,980 --> 02:07:04,780
Awesome.

1884
02:07:04,780 --> 02:07:09,040
This should not happen often.

1885
02:07:10,900 --> 02:07:16,410
07:00 For the tired four the special time is drawing near

1886
02:07:20,830 --> 02:07:21,810
Good morning

1887
02:07:22,900 --> 02:07:24,790
High Schoolers mornings are early

1888
02:07:26,140 --> 02:07:31,400
Endo, get up! Today is your graduation

1889
02:07:31,400 --> 02:07:34,070
Your fun school life ends today

1890
02:07:35,160 --> 02:07:37,430
Eat breakfast for now

1891
02:07:46,550 --> 02:07:53,760
The refreshing air relieves the four from their tension, but at the same time

1892
02:07:54,080 --> 02:08:00,710
At headquarters Hamada moves towards the climax. What kind of traps await the four?

1893
02:08:04,150 --> 02:08:05,620
The sleeves are a bit short too

1894
02:08:08,860 --> 02:08:10,530
like you're supposed to be from a poor family.

1895
02:08:10,530 --> 02:08:13,140
That's the kind of look they went for

1896
02:08:16,040 --> 02:08:17,820
Ah such a setting

1897
02:08:17,820 --> 02:08:19,200
this is second hand.

1898
02:08:20,860 --> 02:08:26,370
08:00 Only one event left of the batsu game

1899
02:08:36,500 --> 02:08:41,600
Fujiwara dressed as Lum-Chan (an Anime character)
for no reason

1900
02:08:36,510 --> 02:08:41,500

Even his ass is flabby

1903
02:08:53,100 --> 02:08:55,080
His ass is amazing

1904
02:08:55,080 --> 02:08:56,080
his ass is huge.

1905
02:08:56,080 --> 02:08:57,810
what's up with him?

1906
02:09:04,810 --> 02:09:06,680
Let's go

1907
02:09:06,680 --> 02:09:12,220
Yes, just graduation left.

1908
02:09:16,580 --> 02:09:21,440
look at his ass, I can't tell the ass from the back.

1909
02:09:26,340 --> 02:09:28,180
It's hot today!

1910
02:09:28,220 --> 02:09:30,930

1911
02:09:32,090 --> 02:09:33,440
come on darling!

1912
02:09:43,690 --> 02:09:45,760

Line up here

1914
02:09:55,690 --> 02:10:00,030
Yamasaki, Endo, Tanaka, Matsumoto

1915
02:10:06,430 --> 02:10:13,860
I'd like to begin the Hesei 17th(2005) West Kuchibiru High School graduation

1916
02:10:14,860 --> 02:10:19,410

02:10:44,820 --> 02:10:46,820
Comedian, part of the duo ShinagawaShoji

1919
02:10:44,820 --> 02:10:46,820
Shoji Tomoharu

1920
02:10:54,080 --> 02:10:57,210
In the world there are, different kinds of pi-po-pa

1921
02:10:57,210 --> 02:11:00,110
Pi-po-pa, Pa-pip, Po-pa-pip

1922
02:11:00,110 --> 02:11:02,610
He's like Endo when he was young

1923
02:11:02,610 --> 02:11:04,610
Pi-po-pa, Pa-pip, Po-pa-pip

1924
02:11:04,610 --> 02:11:06,610
Ta-ten-pa-pip-pe-pop

1925
02:11:51,970 --> 02:11:55,270
Enough already

1926
02:11:57,170 --> 02:11:59,270
Sadist Hamada

1927
02:11:59,030 --> 02:12:00,590
Whoa it's Hamada again!

1928
02:12:13,590 --> 02:12:15,740
You are tottering again.

1929
02:12:15,740 --> 02:12:17,350
You look like a radish

1930
02:12:18,740 --> 02:12:20,740
I feel like I was smacked with a
thick rope or something?

1931
02:12:23,930 --> 02:12:28,800
And now, let's sing the school song together.

1932
02:12:43,100 --> 02:12:45,740
How to say... this is...

1933
02:12:49,300 --> 02:12:51,020
She is small!

1934
02:12:53,140 --> 02:12:55,280
Where is she looking at!?

1935
02:13:07,200 --> 02:13:08,780
She doesn't even look at us.

1936
02:13:15,660 --> 02:13:19,020
Pull oneself together and let's sing the school song.

1937
02:13:21,500 --> 02:13:23,420
Can we stop that ?

1938
02:13:31,880 --> 02:13:33,870
She sings playback!

1939
02:13:48,360 --> 02:13:50,900
Her hand gestures
were hilarious!

1940
02:13:57,780 --> 02:13:59,700
Don't look at her face!

1941
02:13:59,700 --> 02:14:01,700
She adds too many emotions on it!

1942
02:14:08,700 --> 02:14:10,800
She is incredible !

1943
02:14:10,800 --> 02:14:12,800
She is so good!

1944
02:14:15,780 --> 02:14:20,880
Yamasaki tries to resist

1945
02:14:24,000 --> 02:14:25,660
You are doing great !

1946
02:14:52,610 --> 02:14:55,980
Pull oneself together and let's sing the school song.

*Music: "Sotsugyou Shashin"

24 hours of reliving their High School days

1956
02:17:18,030 --> 02:17:27,530
But they have no good memories to remember...

1957
02:17:27,870 --> 02:17:34,510
Only the pain of being smacked by the bamboo sword guys

1958
02:17:34,840 --> 02:17:39,510
95 times

1959
02:17:34,840 --> 02:17:39,510

Your student life ends here.

02:18:04,430 --> 02:18:06,270
Be careful when you get home.

1972
02:18:06,360 --> 02:18:07,940
Yes.

1973
02:18:06,680 --> 02:18:07,940
Yes.

02:18:07,220 --> 02:18:07,940
Yes.

1975
02:18:07,940 --> 02:18:10,180
Thank you so much.

1976
02:18:24,100 --> 02:18:26,100
You didn't see it coming, right?

1977
02:18:39,340 --> 02:18:41,360
How many times has she danced this time?

1978
02:18:40,360 --> 02:18:42,520
She's got us 100%

1979
02:18:42,520 --> 02:18:44,000
Yep 100%

1980
02:18:58,490 --> 02:18:59,730
WHO THE HELL ARE YOU!?

1981
02:19:05,460 --> 02:19:07,020
We are outside!

1982
02:19:07,940 --> 02:19:09,700
We already left!

1983
02:19:23,700 --> 02:19:25,400
Itao's wife,

1984
02:19:25,400 --> 02:19:27,760
it's not even his real wife !

1985
02:19:26,480 --> 02:19:27,760
She is not !

1986
02:19:27,760 --> 02:19:30,600
For only 5000yen she really works hard

1987
02:19:31,520 --> 02:19:33,820
That's not true, how could you know that?

1988
02:19:33,820 --> 02:19:35,820
Really 5000!?

1989
02:19:36,000 --> 02:19:38,620
She is the MVP!

1990
02:19:40,230 --> 02:19:41,300
She was awesome.

1991
02:19:41,800 --> 02:19:44,620
In the end did you understand that it was me?

1992
02:19:44,620 --> 02:19:45,500
Yes.

1993
02:19:45,000 --> 02:19:47,280
During the night Endo getting kicked...

1994
02:19:47,280 --> 02:19:49,020
At the end with "the end" title,

1995
02:19:49,020 --> 02:19:51,020
we actually ran like 200m

1996
02:19:51,500 --> 02:19:52,810
We really ran as fast as possible.

1997
02:19:53,780 --> 02:19:59,440
Yes... For Hamada, the batsu game was not finished yet!

1998
02:19:58,640 --> 02:20:01,340
Ouch, I'm in pain! It really hurts me!

1999
02:20:01,680 --> 02:20:06,680
Hamada chases the 4 runners at full speed until exhaustion.

2000
02:20:07,180 --> 02:20:11,320
How much of a super sadist is he?

2001
02:20:17,400 --> 02:20:20,400
Because we didn't know what would happen if Hamada caught us.

2002
02:20:21,040 --> 02:20:23,680
We ran so far!

2003
02:20:22,140 --> 02:20:23,680
We ran so far.

2004
02:20:23,820 --> 02:20:24,720
Too bad...

2005
02:20:25,110 --> 02:20:27,520
...nothing of it will be on air though.

2006
02:20:26,280 --> 02:20:27,520
Huh !?
