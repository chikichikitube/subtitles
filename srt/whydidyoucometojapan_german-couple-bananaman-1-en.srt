00:00:01,060 --> 00:00:03,340
Hello, Bananaman~

2
00:00:05,100 --> 00:00:07,800
I've wanted to meet you!

3
00:00:08,500 --> 00:00:11,680
You surprised me! - Hello!

4
00:00:12,000 --> 00:00:15,680
You were on Tantei Knight Scoop, right?

5
00:00:15,780 --> 00:00:19,480
I heard about it from Takeyama-san.
- You startled me!

6
00:00:19,480 --> 00:00:23,240
We were able to see Tantei Knight Scoop live!

7
00:00:24,200 --> 00:00:26,880
We're really glad.
- I'm happy for you!

8
00:00:26,880 --> 00:00:31,800
I heard from Takeyama-san that you had a really great time.

9
00:00:31,800 --> 00:00:34,040
In the end, everyone was moved to tears!

10
00:00:38,720 --> 00:00:40,900
I love the director ❤

11
00:00:42,920 --> 00:00:46,020
Your dream came true!

12
00:00:46,480 --> 00:00:49,300
22 / 05 / 2017

13
00:00:46,480 --> 00:00:49,300
Broadcast

14
00:00:47,440 --> 00:00:49,300
During the broadcast the other day...

15
00:00:50,000 --> 00:00:52,500
I can see it!
- You can?

16
00:00:54,240 --> 00:00:56,600
The entrance to the ABC building.

17
00:00:57,320 --> 00:00:59,040
Let's go!

18
00:00:59,360 --> 00:01:02,120
We love Tantei Knight Scoop.

19
00:01:02,220 --> 00:01:05,960
And we've seen lots of episodes.

20
00:01:07,160 --> 00:01:10,340
And we want to see them ...  live?

21
00:01:10,680 --> 00:01:12,360
We want to see them live.

22
00:01:14,720 --> 00:01:17,600
They ask directly

23
00:01:14,720 --> 00:01:17,600
To see a taping live

24
00:01:17,760 --> 00:01:19,780
It's no use.

25
00:01:21,320 --> 00:01:24,220
They didn't get to attend a taping.

26
00:01:26,620 --> 00:01:29,060
But...!

27
00:01:29,060 --> 00:01:39,680
Now it would seem that after this broadcast aired, Tantei Kight Scoop was flooded with requests asking them to let them see a taping.

28
00:01:39,680 --> 00:01:46,620
And they fulfilled this request, so they were able to see the show live. - Ah, I see!

29
00:01:57,120 --> 00:02:00,320
What's that? Tokyo Banana [they make cream cakes] ?

30
00:02:00,320 --> 00:02:04,080
You went and bought this just for us!
- Because we're Bananaman after all!

31
00:02:05,520 --> 00:02:07,680
They brought us Tokyo Banana!

32
00:02:07,680 --> 00:02:11,200
I never thought we would get something from you!

33
00:02:11,200 --> 00:02:17,240
What do you think of this studio? [compared to Tantei Knight Scoop]
- It's completely different, isn't it?

34
00:02:18,680 --> 00:02:19,840
Pretty small!

35
00:02:19,960 --> 00:02:21,100
Small?

36
00:02:21,100 --> 00:02:26,360
These are our outfits!
- You're embarrassing us!

37
00:02:26,360 --> 00:02:28,620
I'm sure they've never had a Detective like this!

38
00:02:28,620 --> 00:02:32,240
This is simply the latest fashion trend in Japan.

39
00:02:32,240 --> 00:02:34,300
Definitely not, no way!

40
00:02:34,400 --> 00:02:37,780
Eeeehm~
- No way, he's lying!

41
00:02:37,920 --> 00:02:40,420
But, Tantei Knight Scoop is Number 1.

42
00:02:40,420 --> 00:02:44,120
"Why did you come to Japan" is Number 2!

43
00:02:44,200 --> 00:02:46,240
Ah, I'm glad about that. Thank you!
