00:00:12,790 --> 00:00:16,130
So, this marks the 30th episode

10
00:00:13,390 --> 00:00:16,030

13
00:00:15,560 --> 00:00:16,390
Wow, it's really the 30th?

14
00:00:16,190 --> 00:00:18,630
Yamasaki Hosei

15
00:00:16,230 --> 00:00:17,940
We haven't done canned tuna, have we?

16
00:00:18,110 --> 00:00:18,950
No, we haven't

17
00:00:19,560 --> 00:00:21,510
Let's look at the recent results

18
00:00:20,880 --> 00:00:22,650
Yes, that makes it easier to understand

19
00:00:22,080 --> 00:00:24,770
Well, with canned coffee

20
00:00:24,770 --> 00:00:25,630
Right, we started with that

21
00:00:25,630 --> 00:00:27,630
The results definitely fluctuate

22
00:00:27,770 --> 00:00:28,470
Like Hamada-san will constantly get it right

23
00:00:28,470 --> 00:00:29,470
Like Hamada-san will constantly get it right

24
00:00:29,470 --> 00:00:30,680
Like Hamada-san will constantly get it right

25
00:00:30,680 --> 00:00:31,280
Everybody is already saying that

26
00:00:31,280 --> 00:00:33,350
Everybody is already saying that

27
00:00:33,350 --> 00:00:35,650
"Everybody is already saying that"?

28
00:00:35,650 --> 00:00:38,850
Did they say that?

29
00:00:37,820 --> 00:00:38,980
Yes, they did

30
00:00:38,980 --> 00:00:41,240
With that, today is canned tuna, however

31
00:00:41,250 --> 00:00:42,350
the staff was thinking of using 15 types of tuna

32
00:00:42,350 --> 00:00:44,490
the staff was thinking of using 15 types of tuna

33
00:00:44,490 --> 00:00:45,490
but thanks to my sense of justice, they changed it to 12 types

34
00:00:45,490 --> 00:00:47,360
but thanks to my sense of justice, they changed it to 12 types

35
00:00:47,520 --> 00:00:50,960
Cocorico

36
00:00:47,520 --> 00:00:50,960
Endo Shozo

Tanaka Naoki

38
00:00:47,700 --> 00:00:48,850
Thank you so much

39
00:00:49,220 --> 00:00:50,640
It was my sense of justice

40
00:00:50,270 --> 00:00:51,410
Your sense of justice!

41
00:00:50,720 --> 00:00:53,620
No, when you came in this morning you said, "15 is impossible!"

42
00:00:53,320 --> 00:00:53,990
That's true

43
00:00:53,990 --> 00:00:55,170
Can I just add something?

44
00:00:55,440 --> 00:00:58,880
Out of 21 people, only 5 people got it right

45
00:00:57,570 --> 00:01:04,610
Results from staff simulation: 5/21 people

46
00:00:59,190 --> 00:01:01,000
You always say that, but

47
00:01:00,850 --> 00:01:02,440
The data isn't accurate

48
00:01:01,730 --> 00:01:03,120
yeah, truly

49
00:01:02,690 --> 00:01:04,040
They always lie

50
00:01:03,660 --> 00:01:04,880
That's surely not a lie!

51
00:01:05,020 --> 00:01:06,070
It's because they eat cheap food!

52
00:01:06,700 --> 00:01:07,880
Maybe that's true

53
00:01:07,520 --> 00:01:08,350
Seriously

54
00:01:09,100 --> 00:01:11,080
Did it have this scent before?!

55
00:01:12,380 --> 00:01:13,160
Let's just have fun

56
00:01:13,960 --> 00:01:15,940
I DID IT!!!

57
00:01:20,390 --> 00:01:24,930
Kiki Canned Tuna

58
00:01:20,390 --> 00:01:24,930
The Kiki series 30th installment

59
00:01:21,280 --> 00:01:23,890
To celebrate the 30th Kiki episode,

60
00:01:24,010 --> 00:01:25,130
it's canned tuna!

61
00:01:25,130 --> 00:01:29,830
Kiki Canned Tuna

62
00:01:25,130 --> 00:01:29,830
They will eat it while blindfolded,

63
00:01:25,130 --> 00:01:29,830
then identify which brand it is out of the 12.

64
00:01:26,210 --> 00:01:29,680
While blindfolded, they will identify the brand they are eating out of the twelve.

65
00:01:29,970 --> 00:01:32,320
If they get it right, they will receive a 100 thousand yen prize!

66
00:01:30,030 --> 00:01:35,540
If they get it right, they will receive a 100 thousand yen prize!!

67
00:01:30,030 --> 00:01:35,540
If they get it wrong, they will receive a severe punishment!!

68
00:01:32,510 --> 00:01:35,290
If they get it wrong, they will receive a severe punishment!

69
00:01:35,900 --> 00:01:37,210
Endo, are you going to be able to do this?

70
00:01:37,260 --> 00:01:37,990
I'll do my best!

71
00:01:38,570 --> 00:01:41,900
First up is Endo, who will try to win for the first time in 5 years

72
00:01:40,410 --> 00:01:48,420
(Ion)

73
00:01:40,410 --> 00:01:48,420
Endo's challenge

74
00:01:40,410 --> 00:01:48,420
Top Value Light Tuna Flakes

75
00:01:42,480 --> 00:01:47,240
The brand is Ion's private product, Top Value Light Tuna Flakes

76
00:01:48,580 --> 00:01:49,370
I'll eat now

77
00:01:49,840 --> 00:01:51,400
This seems to depend on how it's handled

78
00:01:51,400 --> 00:01:52,680
or how it's taken apart

79
00:01:52,810 --> 00:01:54,920
I wonder how this one will turn out

80
00:01:55,830 --> 00:01:57,300
You checking it out?

81
00:01:57,610 --> 00:01:58,560
He's checking it out...

82
00:01:57,660 --> 00:02:00,560
You will even check out tuna?

83
00:02:00,770 --> 00:02:03,330
I'm gonna check you out!!!

84
00:02:04,840 --> 00:02:08,360
At first the oil filled my mouth and after about 10 seconds the oil drained,

85
00:02:08,340 --> 00:02:12,540
but when I squeezed it again some oil came out

86
00:02:12,960 --> 00:02:14,770
so I'm relying on that bit...

87
00:02:14,770 --> 00:02:16,790
I bet they're all like that...

88
00:02:15,800 --> 00:02:17,300
I have no idea what he's on about...

89
00:02:17,300 --> 00:02:18,340
I'll go with this one

90
00:02:17,510 --> 00:02:54,920
Correct answer

94
00:02:24,920 --> 00:02:26,560
The smell is extremely similar

95
00:02:26,560 --> 00:02:28,560
The smell is extremely similar

96
00:02:33,290 --> 00:02:34,970
What, seriously?

97
00:02:34,970 --> 00:02:36,100
You always say "I got it!", or "it's wrong!"

98
00:02:36,100 --> 00:02:37,670
You always say "I got it!", or "it's wrong!"

99
00:02:37,670 --> 00:02:39,700
You always say "I got it!", or "it's wrong!"

100
00:02:40,240 --> 00:02:43,250
It filled my mouth with oil like it did earlier,

101
00:02:43,180 --> 00:02:43,870
There he goes

102
00:02:44,000 --> 00:02:46,640
and after 10 seconds the oil is gone

103
00:02:46,820 --> 00:02:48,100
and it's kind of dried out

104
00:02:48,680 --> 00:02:51,550
after that, there's still some oil that I can suck out

105
00:02:52,150 --> 00:02:53,580
It's exactly like the one I ate 3-4 minutes ago

106
00:02:53,580 --> 00:02:54,920
It's exactly like the one I ate 3-4 minutes ago

107
00:02:55,290 --> 00:02:56,510
I think it's this one, but

108
00:02:55,740 --> 00:02:56,880
I would think so too

109
00:02:56,900 --> 00:02:57,390
but

110
00:02:57,660 --> 00:04:06,960

112
00:02:57,800 --> 00:03:01,670
I can believe that if I came over here I'd say "oh, this is completely different"

113
00:03:05,660 --> 00:03:07,590
He suddenly gave up

114
00:03:08,190 --> 00:03:09,590
What the hell!?

115
00:03:09,300 --> 00:03:10,600
You had that thought process

116
00:03:10,390 --> 00:03:11,520
Keep going

117
00:03:10,730 --> 00:03:12,920
This must definitely be wrong

118
00:03:13,860 --> 00:03:16,150
There's no way I'd get it this quickly

119
00:03:16,660 --> 00:03:17,320
Alright, here I go

120
00:03:18,870 --> 00:03:20,850
The tuna that I ate is NOT Inaba Light Tuna Flakes

121
00:03:20,850 --> 00:03:24,180
The tuna that I ate is NOT Inaba Light Tuna Flakes

122
00:03:27,840 --> 00:03:30,550
This is quite a big moment

123
00:03:31,010 --> 00:03:34,200
I really thought that was the tuna can I ate, so now I think it's around here

124
00:03:34,630 --> 00:03:37,280
and the ones here are significantly different

125
00:03:36,260 --> 00:03:36,960
One time?

126
00:03:37,320 --> 00:03:38,000
Yes yes yes

127
00:03:37,340 --> 00:03:37,670
Yes

128
00:03:38,390 --> 00:03:39,900
There is a Korean brand here...

129
00:03:39,900 --> 00:03:41,330
Korean brand?

130
00:03:40,470 --> 00:03:41,330
Yes, right here

Ah, this is different

135
00:03:46,930 --> 00:03:48,060
The smell... this is just

136
00:03:48,540 --> 00:03:49,560
This has no smell

137
00:03:53,010 --> 00:03:55,550
Whoa

138
00:03:56,700 --> 00:03:58,630
Excuse me, I'm really concentrating

139
00:03:59,790 --> 00:04:02,570
Chew, fart, shock, then laughter

140

2 ROUNDS CLEAR

151
00:04:17,030 --> 00:04:19,320
Maybe you should get to the correct one for your tongue's sake

152
00:04:19,320 --> 00:04:24,000
Now, I will try "Oltis Fatty Tuna in Oil"

153
00:04:22,510 --> 00:04:25,240
Even though I keep saying it's over here

154
00:04:22,510 --> 00:04:25,240
you keep going over there

155
00:04:25,240 --> 00:04:27,610
You're trying to be on screen as much as possible, aren't you?

156
00:04:29,860 --> 00:04:30,770
Is that wrong?

157
00:04:32,410 --> 00:04:33,090
Who are you?

158
00:04:33,500 --> 00:04:34,880
His throat sounded so dry...

159
00:04:35,560 --> 00:04:37,710
Okay, okay, then, sorry

160
00:04:36,610 --> 00:04:38,260
Let's get to it!

161
00:04:37,880 --> 00:04:39,260
Alright, then is it really okay?

162
00:04:39,260 --> 00:04:40,140
Of course!

163
00:04:39,570 --> 00:04:40,500
Yeah!

164
00:04:40,360 --> 00:04:42,100
You should be okay

165
00:04:41,610 --> 00:04:42,480
For me,

166
00:04:42,770 --> 00:04:45,920
this was the most similar to it

167
00:04:46,030 --> 00:05:25,240
Correct answer

168
00:04:46,030 --> 00:05:25,240
Top Value Light Tuna Flakes

169
00:04:46,160 --> 00:04:47,310
These were all completely different.

170
00:04:47,110 --> 00:04:47,780
Interesting.

171
00:04:47,560 --> 00:04:48,520
So that means...

172
00:04:48,210 --> 00:04:51,100
Which means that it must be from the same company: Inaba

173
00:04:51,630 --> 00:04:52,990
these white tuna flakes

174
00:04:53,580 --> 00:04:54,520
I think it'll be this one!

175
00:04:54,640 --> 00:04:55,350
Yeah, then go

There's the oil

179
00:05:00,440 --> 00:05:01,980
then after a bit the oil goes away and it becomes dry

180
00:05:01,980 --> 00:05:03,510
then after a bit the oil goes away and it becomes dry

181
00:05:03,810 --> 00:05:05,620
It's got to be this one...

182
00:05:05,780 --> 00:05:06,440
I'm just gonna do it!

183
00:05:08,780 --> 00:05:10,200
Please, I'm begging you

184
00:05:11,460 --> 00:05:12,100
Can I go?

185
00:05:12,280 --> 00:05:12,590
Go ahead

00:05:14,510 --> 00:05:20,990
The tuna that I ate IS Inaba White Tuna Flakes

189
00:05:29,040 --> 00:05:29,850
Oh, what is this...

190
00:05:31,110 --> 00:05:33,290
This looks grave...

191
00:05:33,490 --> 00:05:33,930
There he is

192
00:05:33,930 --> 00:05:34,390
I'm scared

193
00:05:34,390 --> 00:05:34,740
What?

194
00:05:34,840 --> 00:05:36,020
What is this?

195
00:05:37,020 --> 00:05:41,450
I'm going to check you out like a frozen tuna!!

196
00:05:43,240 --> 00:05:45,510
It's coming off of his face

197
00:05:46,640 --> 00:05:47,400
This was the right answer

198
00:05:47,890 --> 00:05:49,160
That? It was the next one

199
00:05:49,280 --> 00:05:49,900
Right!

200
00:05:50,060 --> 00:05:51,220
It was the next next one

201
00:05:50,520 --> 00:05:51,370
The next one

202
00:05:51,420 --> 00:05:52,450
If you went from the left

203
00:05:51,470 --> 00:05:54,340
Wow, I wouldn't have known...

204
00:05:53,310 --> 00:05:54,500
Well go on and taste it

205
00:05:55,200 --> 00:05:56,300
It says "top value"

206
00:05:59,540 --> 00:06:00,400
Oh this is definitely it.

207
00:06:00,910 --> 00:06:01,860
Are you serious?!

208
00:06:02,060 --> 00:06:02,740
Really?

209
00:06:04,090 --> 00:06:04,810

Tanaka's challenge uses domestic rice bran oil,

215

Maguro Light Tuna Flakes

216
00:06:19,750 --> 00:06:21,230
Wow, that's really oily

217
00:06:22,180 --> 00:06:22,720
Is that so?

218
00:06:22,720 --> 00:06:23,200
Yes

219
00:06:23,470 --> 00:06:25,710
It's different from what I imagined

220
00:06:25,560 --> 00:06:26,440
Interesting

221
00:06:26,140 --> 00:06:26,730
Very wet?

222
00:06:26,980 --> 00:06:27,960
It is very wet

223
00:06:28,040 --> 00:06:29,490
Oh, that could serve as a hint

224
00:06:29,580 --> 00:06:31,960
So it's possible that you

225
00:06:32,490 --> 00:06:33,820
haven't even eaten it before?

226
00:06:33,820 --> 00:06:34,370
Yes

227
00:06:35,180 --> 00:06:36,260
The flavor, though

228
00:06:36,710 --> 00:06:39,780
It's upside down

229
00:06:37,470 --> 00:06:39,750
Your spoon is upside down, you're not getting anything

230
00:06:40,080 --> 00:06:40,680
Man Tanaka,

231
00:06:40,680 --> 00:06:42,680
that wasn't funny

232
00:06:42,680 --> 00:06:45,550
I could have done that!

236
00:06:50,350 --> 00:06:52,620
then I'll gauge the difference from there

237
00:06:52,620 --> 00:06:53,900
2,110 yen (about $18)

238
00:06:53,900 --> 00:06:55,450
Yes, this one from France

239
00:06:56,070 --> 00:06:59,070
ah Spain, uh, the Vatican

240
00:06:57,820 --> 00:06:58,410

Definitely not!!

245
00:07:03,560 --> 00:07:03,990
How quick

246
00:07:05,110 --> 00:07:05,680
It's wrong!

247
00:07:06,160 --> 00:07:11,940
The tuna that I ate was NOT the Vatican Tonno Tuna in Olive Oil

248
00:07:13,630 --> 00:07:14,200
That's right

249
00:07:15,790 --> 00:07:18,830
This is just what I think, but he should make it a short battle

250
00:07:18,710 --> 00:07:21,870
Yeah, he's going to forget what he ate

251
00:07:19,120 --> 00:07:20,360
I see what you're saying

252
00:07:20,300 --> 00:07:21,440
The oil will dry up too

253
00:07:21,440 --> 00:07:23,000
And his mouth will get oily

puts too much emphasis on

260
00:07:29,160 --> 00:07:32,000
when someone says something wrong

261
00:07:31,290 --> 00:07:32,290
We should be a little less harsh?

262
00:07:32,240 --> 00:07:35,310
Yes, we should...

263
00:07:33,170 --> 00:07:35,110
Yeah but even if you say that...

264
00:07:35,720 --> 00:07:37,290
I don't know, but since when did we get so focused on detail?

266
00:07:38,230 --> 00:07:38,870
It's not it

300

Kurashomoa Light Tuna Flakes

379
00:11:35,840 --> 00:11:38,510
It's similar.

380
00:11:39,890 --> 00:11:41,370
But you know, the body...

381
00:11:41,760 --> 00:11:45,770
It wasn't so dry when I squeezed the body...

382
00:11:49,130 --> 00:11:49,820
"The body"

383
00:11:50,140 --> 00:11:51,600
Squeezing it?

384
00:11:51,120 --> 00:11:53,170
You squeeze it tight with your tongue

385
00:11:52,510 --> 00:11:55,130
You would squeeze it with your tongue

386
00:11:55,250 --> 00:11:57,580
No, there was definitely more flavor

387
00:11:57,580 --> 00:11:59,470
What is he talking about with the "flavor"?

388
00:11:59,380 --> 00:12:00,800
The body has a flavor

389
00:12:00,480 --> 00:12:02,620
Not the body, but the combination

390
00:12:00,800 --> 00:12:01,600
The body's flavor

391
00:12:02,720 --> 00:12:07,800
of the body and the oil creates not a saltiness but a sort of flavor

392
00:12:08,810 --> 00:12:10,040
This is the first time he's said this

393
00:12:09,930 --> 00:12:11,330
It definitely builds up

394
00:12:11,520 --> 00:12:12,390
How interesting

395
00:12:12,230 --> 00:12:16,340
It's bland but I feel like there was a saltiness at the end

396
00:12:18,880 --> 00:12:20,420
Damn it man, so annoying

397
00:12:20,900 --> 00:12:22,610
This needs to stop

398
00:12:22,610 --> 00:12:25,050
I don't wanna hear this

399
00:12:25,330 --> 00:12:26,590
Let's just do it

400
00:12:26,690 --> 00:12:28,200
Just do it boss!

401
00:12:28,710 --> 00:12:29,600
Let's just have fun

402
00:12:29,040 --> 00:12:30,070
He's been saying nonsense

403
00:12:29,650 --> 00:12:32,550
It didn't have that final saltiness

404
00:12:32,720 --> 00:12:33,550
Nope, this is wrong

405
00:12:35,900 --> 00:12:36,270
Too far from the can

406
00:12:36,270 --> 00:12:38,270
Too far from the can

407
00:12:38,080 --> 00:12:39,110
As always

408
00:12:38,540 --> 00:12:40,260
He memorizes it and then moves it closer

409
00:12:40,260 --> 00:12:41,580
He's not seeing it, he is seeing it

410
00:12:41,770 --> 00:12:43,460
He can see it right, and then he memorizes

411
00:12:43,460 --> 00:12:45,350
Memorizes...

412
00:12:44,790 --> 00:12:46,270
The tuna I ate

413
00:12:46,560 --> 00:12:48,910
was NOT Nihon Kyutsu Sangyo

414
00:12:48,830 --> 00:12:49,850
You can't even remember the name?!

415
00:12:50,500 --> 00:12:53,900
Kurashimoa Light Tuna Flakes!

416
00:12:53,900 --> 00:12:55,050
He can't even say it

417
00:12:58,720 --> 00:13:01,380
Well that was one hurdle he's cleared now

418
00:13:01,380 --> 00:13:02,910
I'll go with the most bland one

419
00:13:03,140 --> 00:13:04,550
It's becoming more precise

420

This must be the only option

425
00:13:07,710 --> 00:13:08,860
If we're measuring by blandness

426
00:13:08,860 --> 00:13:09,240
Inaba

427
00:13:09,810 --> 00:13:10,240
Bland

428
00:13:12,840 --> 00:13:14,340
DID IT HAVE THIS SCENT EARLIER!?

429
00:13:14,340 --> 00:13:16,370
DID IT HAVE THIS SCENT EARLIER!?

430
00:13:16,370 --> 00:13:17,750
Please, please don't get angry, sir.

431
00:13:16,990 --> 00:13:18,830
Don't get so upset!

432
00:13:18,830 --> 00:13:20,020
Let's just have an enjoyable time

433
00:13:20,020 --> 00:13:22,990
This is wrong, it was supposed to be bland

434
00:13:23,340 --> 00:13:24,160
It has a scent

435
00:13:24,820 --> 00:13:27,370
Well that's kind of how it is

436
00:13:27,790 --> 00:13:29,550
Whoa, this really smells

437
00:13:32,690 --> 00:13:34,540
Well the amount of oil

438
00:13:35,480 --> 00:13:36,750
isn't too different

439
00:13:38,200 --> 00:13:41,240
But at the end, a little saltiness...

440
00:13:42,130 --> 00:13:42,810
The important part

441
00:13:43,350 --> 00:13:43,980
The saltiness

442
00:13:43,810 --> 00:13:44,620
The saltiness, yes

443
00:13:44,190 --> 00:13:47,310
But when I was smelling it over there, I didn't

444
00:13:47,310 --> 00:13:51,590
smell such a strong tuna scent

445
00:13:53,410 --> 00:13:58,840
What if I get it wrong and it buzzes and they say "this was it"

446
00:13:58,840 --> 00:14:02,680
and I smell it and it has a scent after all, what am I going to do?

447
00:14:03,450 --> 00:14:06,790
We don't know, you're supposed to guess that...

448
00:14:07,190 --> 00:14:09,760
Maybe I should just choose this one

449
00:14:09,760 --> 00:14:11,790
Instead!!

If I do say so myself, it's very close

It already has a scent!

496
00:16:01,070 --> 00:16:03,070
It smells like bonito!

497
00:16:03,540 --> 00:16:04,370

It's tuna flakes

501
00:16:09,290 --> 00:16:10,310
Of course it'll smell like fish

Just smell it again and stuff

562
00:17:52,310 --> 00:17:54,070
Yes, just smell it

563
00:17:54,150 --> 00:17:55,900
I totally thought it would be this

564
00:17:58,190 --> 00:17:59,450
There's absolutely no scent

565
00:17:59,900 --> 00:18:01,230
If it's something you've had before

566
00:18:01,310 --> 00:18:02,480
This pattern is

567
00:18:02,910 --> 00:18:03,710
really unfortunate

568
00:18:05,020 --> 00:18:06,550
Whaaat? Wait-

569
00:18:09,390 --> 00:18:11,660
It's different, completely different

570
00:18:13,180 --> 00:18:14,350
Alright, let's start here

571
00:18:15,650 --> 00:18:18,840
Inaba Light Tuna Flakes, the one I ate-

572
00:18:20,010 --> 00:18:21,690
What?

573
00:18:21,490 --> 00:18:22,470
What kind of grammar is that?!  *(or, anastrophe)

574
00:18:23,390 --> 00:18:24,650
IT IS WRONG!

575
00:18:27,280 --> 00:18:28,300
Y-LOOK!

576
00:18:28,590 --> 00:18:29,190
Y-look?

577
00:18:28,930 --> 00:18:30,040
Y-look!

578
00:18:30,260 --> 00:18:31,360
"Yossha" and "ora"  (ora means look)

579
00:18:31,440 --> 00:18:32,600
It was different!

580
00:18:32,920 --> 00:18:36,220
Currently Tasting

581
00:18:32,920 --> 00:18:36,220
Tonno Tuna in Olive Oil

582
00:18:32,920 --> 00:19:42,590
Correct answer

583
00:18:32,920 --> 00:19:42,590
Deliciously Prepared Tuna
(Hotei Foods)

584
00:18:35,010 --> 00:18:38,780
The one he aimed for was incorrect, but he tastes the next ones with certainty

585
00:18:36,220 --> 00:18:41,700
Currently Tasting

586
00:18:36,220 --> 00:18:41,700
Ortiz Tuna in Olive Oil
(French F&B Japan)

587
00:18:40,360 --> 00:18:42,590
and he miraculously clears 2 rounds!!

588
00:18:43,030 --> 00:18:45,630
8 clear out of 12

589
00:18:43,340 --> 00:18:44,770
So just these left?

590
00:18:44,810 --> 00:18:45,530
Wow, amazing

591
00:18:45,050 --> 00:18:45,850
4 more to go!

592
00:18:48,030 --> 00:18:48,430
This-

593
00:18:49,960 --> 00:18:50,540
I'll try this

594
00:18:50,830 --> 00:18:51,570
The Korean one

595
00:18:52,710 --> 00:19:42,590
Currently tasting

596
00:18:52,710 --> 00:19:42,590
Tougen Canned Tuna

597
00:19:09,650 --> 00:19:11,250
Even though this is my first time eating this,

598
00:19:13,290 --> 00:19:14,880
I've eaten this before

599
00:19:16,260 --> 00:19:17,500
This is the one I ate before

600
00:19:18,530 --> 00:19:19,440
Really, really!

601
00:19:21,100 --> 00:19:22,180
He's really going at it

602
00:19:30,980 --> 00:19:31,880
I'm very confident

603
00:19:32,430 --> 00:19:34,600
The tuna I ate WAS Tougen Canned Tuna

604
00:19:34,600 --> 00:19:36,650
The tuna I ate WAS Tougen Canned Tuna

605
00:19:36,650 --> 00:19:37,450
The tuna I ate WAS Tougen Canned Tuna

606
00:19:47,560 --> 00:19:48,750
I really thought he would get it

607
00:19:48,760 --> 00:19:51,760
You took so much damn time

608
00:19:51,880 --> 00:19:53,120
You were so close!

609
00:19:52,560 --> 00:19:54,270
So close! What a waste

610
00:19:54,160 --> 00:19:55,730
You were so confident!

611
00:19:54,490 --> 00:19:56,130
You really believed it

612
00:19:56,440 --> 00:20:01,640
YOU ARE COLDER (lamer) THAN FROZEN TUNA!!

613
00:20:03,540 --> 00:20:04,710
Yama-chan...

614
00:20:04,640 --> 00:20:05,570
Zaki-san!

615
00:20:04,680 --> 00:20:06,180
Hosei-san!

616
00:20:06,180 --> 00:20:07,790
Come on, you just ate this!

617
00:20:13,490 --> 00:20:16,860
I don't know what this is

618
00:20:15,690 --> 00:20:16,250
Of course

619
00:20:17,190 --> 00:20:17,890
Da-dun!

620
00:20:17,200 --> 00:20:18,510
In that case, you can't do anything

621
00:20:20,240 --> 00:20:24,020
Last is Matsumoto, who has also gone 7 years with no victories

622
00:20:24,500 --> 00:20:30,140
(Ion)

623
00:20:24,500 --> 00:20:30,140
Matsumoto's Challenge

624
00:20:24,500 --> 00:20:30,140
Top Value Light Tuna Flakes

625
00:20:25,290 --> 00:20:29,430
His challenge is the same as Endo's: Top Value Light Tuna Flakes

626
00:20:30,760 --> 00:20:32,620
Just tell me who picked it out!

627
00:20:42,560 --> 00:20:42,960
Here!

628
00:20:43,340 --> 00:20:43,860
Is this it?

629
00:20:43,900 --> 00:20:44,310
Yes!

630
00:20:46,450 --> 00:20:48,020
What is this?

631
00:20:48,020 --> 00:20:49,360
I might not know this brand!

632
00:20:49,980 --> 00:20:51,100
Ahh what do I do!?

633
00:20:56,430 --> 00:20:58,470
It's not that oily!

634
00:20:58,470 --> 00:21:00,600
Are you guys serious?!

635
00:21:01,430 --> 00:21:04,050
You guys didn't bring me one that wasn't an option right?!

636
00:21:04,810 --> 00:21:06,370
THIS ISN'T FUNNY TO ME!

637
00:21:09,410 --> 00:21:09,810
Everybody went home, didn't they?

638
00:21:09,810 --> 00:21:12,780
Everybody went home, didn't they?

639
00:21:13,530 --> 00:21:15,190
I wondered what the hell I was supposed to do

640
00:21:15,250 --> 00:21:15,920
That was quite the one-man show

641
00:21:15,920 --> 00:21:17,750
That was quite the one-man show

642
00:21:18,180 --> 00:21:19,650
You guys are dirty!!

643
00:21:20,140 --> 00:21:22,380
Well, but we didn't distract you

644
00:21:21,670 --> 00:21:23,020
Yes yes yes

645
00:21:22,360 --> 00:21:24,040
You were able to fully concentrate

646
00:21:24,990 --> 00:23:18,840
Correct answer

647
00:21:24,990 --> 00:23:18,840
Top Value Light Tuna Flakes
(Ion)

648
00:21:25,380 --> 00:21:26,180
So I think

649
00:21:26,940 --> 00:21:31,590
my theory with these games is that you guys always repeat the previous answers

650
00:21:31,700 --> 00:21:33,030
The one just now (Yamasaki's) was this one, right?

651
00:21:33,030 --> 00:21:34,340
The one just now (Yamasaki's) was this one, right?

652
00:21:34,560 --> 00:21:35,140
Yes

653
00:21:34,560 --> 00:21:35,140
Yes

654
00:21:35,440 --> 00:21:37,880
I can believe that you guys chose this one

655
00:21:37,880 --> 00:21:40,990
if I place myself in your tiiiiiny brains

656
00:21:42,260 --> 00:21:43,900
I can imagine that

657
00:21:46,190 --> 00:21:48,160
my ENORMOUS brain

658
00:21:48,800 --> 00:21:50,220
compared to your tiiiiiny brains-

659
00:21:49,460 --> 00:21:50,660
Hurry up already!

660
00:21:51,180 --> 00:21:51,850
Go on!

661
00:21:51,850 --> 00:23:18,840
Currently tasting

662
00:21:51,850 --> 00:23:18,840
Deliciously Prepared Tuna
(Hotei Foods)

663
00:21:53,160 --> 00:21:55,790
Usually you guys choose the previous answer

664
00:22:03,040 --> 00:22:04,300
I've gone and done it...

665
00:22:11,370 --> 00:22:14,780
I'VE REALLY GONE AND DONE IT!!

666
00:22:16,180 --> 00:22:16,900
What the hell?

667
00:22:18,470 --> 00:22:20,730
The one that Yamazaki failed to identify...

668
00:22:21,090 --> 00:22:23,540
you guys, who gave it to me,

669
00:22:23,550 --> 00:22:24,290
are TRULY disgusting people!

670
00:22:24,290 --> 00:22:27,920
are TRULY disgusting people!

671
00:22:28,450 --> 00:22:30,200
You are so nasty

672
00:22:32,200 --> 00:22:35,450
You are extremely indecent

673
00:22:37,510 --> 00:22:38,360
So, anyway,

674
00:22:38,770 --> 00:22:41,540
even though I said a lot of mean things

675
00:22:42,090 --> 00:22:43,340
He's regretting them

676
00:22:44,180 --> 00:22:46,150
I already have so much confidence,

677
00:22:46,660 --> 00:22:48,260
so there's no way I can quit now

678
00:22:51,850 --> 00:22:53,620
Just by looking at Hamada's face,

679
00:22:53,620 --> 00:22:55,220
Just by looking at Hamada's face,

680
00:22:55,220 --> 00:22:57,390
I think I'm probably correct...

681
00:22:57,870 --> 00:22:58,580
anyhow,

682
00:22:58,920 --> 00:23:03,630
we've been a pair for 30 years

683
00:23:04,370 --> 00:23:05,140
Alright, I got it

684
00:23:05,710 --> 00:23:06,390
HERE I GO!

685
00:23:07,310 --> 00:23:09,530
The tuna that I ate WAS Deliciously Prepared Tuna!

686
00:23:09,530 --> 00:23:13,460
The tuna that I ate WAS Deliciously Prepared Tuna!

687
00:23:13,460 --> 00:23:14,440
The tuna that I ate WAS Deliciously Prepared Tuna!

688
00:23:16,810 --> 00:23:18,910
I'm begging you, I'm begging you...

689
00:23:23,890 --> 00:23:25,210
It was completely different!

690
00:23:27,820 --> 00:23:29,200
On the first try!

691
00:23:29,200 --> 00:23:30,640
He didn't get anything correct

692
00:23:30,810 --> 00:23:31,800
He always does this

693
00:23:31,950 --> 00:23:37,830
You're going to eat tuna tonight anyway, right?

694
00:23:42,460 --> 00:23:43,570
Huh, what?

695
00:23:43,830 --> 00:23:44,650
It was this one

696
00:23:45,030 --> 00:23:46,140
What the hell is with that?

697
00:23:46,940 --> 00:23:49,060
What the hell is with that normality?

698
00:23:50,050 --> 00:23:52,940
What pieces of shit you guys are!

699
00:23:53,540 --> 00:23:55,600
Then which one would you have liked?

700
00:23:56,420 --> 00:23:56,970
Yes, that one

701
00:23:57,820 --> 00:24:00,150
You just ate that one, come on

702
00:24:01,740 --> 00:24:02,920
I have absolutely no idea
