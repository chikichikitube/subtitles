4
00:00:00,670 --> 00:00:02,680
What!?

5
00:00:01,280 --> 00:00:03,130
Yes.

6
00:00:02,680 --> 00:00:04,190
Seriously?

7
00:00:03,320 --> 00:00:04,760
Yes.

8
00:00:04,190 --> 00:00:06,640
Shozo, where's Tanaka?

9
00:00:06,640 --> 00:00:10,540
Oh, well.....I'm sure he'll be here soon.

10
00:00:10,540 --> 00:00:12,540
Do you want to go scare him?

11
00:00:12,540 --> 00:00:14,030
What do ya mean?

12
00:00:13,130 --> 00:00:16,400
Oh yeah, take a cameraman with you and...

13
00:00:18,840 --> 00:00:19,660
Idiots!

14
00:00:19,660 --> 00:00:22,920
Yamazaki's finally turned over a new leaf and started to come on time.

15
00:00:22,920 --> 00:00:24,920
At least an hour and a half early...

16
00:00:23,920 --> 00:00:26,170
Stop friggin' lying!

17
00:00:26,170 --> 00:00:28,780
I'm seriously traumatised from that, you know!

18
00:00:27,960 --> 00:00:29,790
Idiot!

19
00:00:28,780 --> 00:00:32,510
He gets scared as soon as the elevator opens

20
00:00:32,510 --> 00:00:34,600
and can't stop sweating from the trauma.

21
00:00:34,600 --> 00:00:36,460
He thinks I'll be there, does he?

22
00:00:36,460 --> 00:00:37,610
Yeah he thinks Hamada might be there.

23
00:00:37,610 --> 00:00:39,100
Good morning.

24
00:00:39,100 --> 00:00:41,320
Who the heck are you?

25
00:00:39,880 --> 00:00:42,380
What? We're License.

26
00:00:41,320 --> 00:00:43,320
Ahhh, right. License.

27
00:00:43,320 --> 00:00:47,290
There's something about Tanaka-san we'd like to talk about.

28
00:00:45,950 --> 00:00:48,190
He's not here yet.

29
00:00:47,290 --> 00:00:48,990
Yes. That's right.

30
00:00:48,990 --> 00:00:52,700
You know how you did the "100 Things About Matsumoto" sketch the other day?

31
00:00:52,700 --> 00:00:57,290
Do you remember how Matsumoto-san said

32
00:00:57,290 --> 00:01:00,280
"I wouldn't want to be reborn as Tanaka-san"?

33
00:01:02,160 --> 00:01:05,820
The issue pertains to a remark made during "100 Things About Matsumoto".

34
00:01:05,820 --> 00:01:07,820
Here is the answer.

35
00:01:07,820 --> 00:01:09,820
Errr....Tanaka.

36
00:01:09,820 --> 00:01:11,820
Whaaat? It's Tanaka?

37
00:01:12,650 --> 00:01:15,050
Furthermore, when asked for his reason....

38
00:01:15,050 --> 00:01:19,210
(His life) seems boring!

39
00:01:19,600 --> 00:01:22,460
Was I meant to be choosing from one of us?

40
00:01:22,460 --> 00:01:27,720
Because, I actually meant that out of all Asians.

41
00:01:29,000 --> 00:01:33,630
Ever since around then, Tanaka-san has become a bit crazy.

42
00:01:33,630 --> 00:01:36,570
But that was sort of just part of a joke, ya know?

43
00:01:36,570 --> 00:01:41,020
He was also saying stuff like "Maybe I won't go to Gaki anymore".

44
00:01:41,020 --> 00:01:42,670
I really doubt that.

45
00:01:42,670 --> 00:01:45,740
That's an immense character change.

46
00:01:44,590 --> 00:01:46,890
He's not the type to say stuff like that!

47
00:01:46,440 --> 00:01:48,000
And what else?

48
00:01:46,970 --> 00:01:52,560
Anyway, we asked some Gaki staff to record him on film.

49
00:01:52,560 --> 00:01:54,440
Of Tanaka?

50
00:01:53,080 --> 00:01:55,420
Tanaka's recent activities.

51
00:01:55,420 --> 00:01:57,420
Would you mind watching?

52
00:01:56,320 --> 00:01:58,080
Yeah, let's watch it.

53
00:01:57,420 --> 00:01:59,420
Oh we can watch it here?

54
00:01:58,270 --> 00:02:00,250
Yes, we can.

55
00:01:59,420 --> 00:02:02,700
That's weird, he never was that kind of person.

56
00:02:02,700 --> 00:02:05,740
Yeah, out of all of us I'm sure Endo knows him best.

57
00:02:06,460 --> 00:02:09,530
I'm not really sure how exactly he'd change.

58
00:02:14,400 --> 00:02:18,810
Should we really release this footage into the open?

59
00:02:19,290 --> 00:02:24,320
After much debate, we decided to bring it out to the world.

60
00:02:27,560 --> 00:02:34,620
1st Day Of Shooting A.M 9:06

61
00:02:28,910 --> 00:02:34,280
We followed License, who had been called by Tanaka to meet him.

62
00:02:35,870 --> 00:02:39,050
Please film everything until the end.

63
00:02:40,200 --> 00:02:42,030
OI!

64
00:02:43,130 --> 00:02:44,890
OI!

65
00:02:43,790 --> 00:02:45,950
Good morning!

66
00:02:46,200 --> 00:02:48,460
LICENSE!

67
00:03:00,570 --> 00:03:03,850
Please film everything until the end.

68
00:03:05,560 --> 00:03:07,560
OI!

69
00:03:08,480 --> 00:03:10,270
OI!

70
00:03:11,600 --> 00:03:13,680
LICENSE!

71
00:03:15,000 --> 00:03:17,000
OI!

72
00:03:17,000 --> 00:03:19,000
WHAT'CHA DOIN'?

73
00:03:19,000 --> 00:03:21,000
We'll be right there! Hold on.

74
00:03:21,880 --> 00:03:26,200
You can undoubtedly sense a strange difference to Tanaka.

75
00:03:26,200 --> 00:03:28,200
Please explain it to him properly.

76
00:03:28,510 --> 00:03:30,200
About us.

77
00:03:29,240 --> 00:03:30,960
Oh yeah, of course.

78
00:03:31,920 --> 00:03:32,520
Good morning.

79
00:03:32,520 --> 00:03:34,520
Good morning.

80
00:03:34,520 --> 00:03:36,240
You took a while.

81
00:03:35,420 --> 00:03:37,000
Yes, sorry.

82
00:03:36,240 --> 00:03:40,940
Today we've got Gaki's cameras with us today, is that okay?

83
00:03:40,410 --> 00:03:41,930
Why?

84
00:03:41,930 --> 00:03:45,660
I don't really mind but....there's nothing interesting here.

85
00:03:46,940 --> 00:03:49,800
You eat these Super Cup noodles so early in the morning?

86
00:03:49,800 --> 00:03:52,430
This is what I always eat for breakfast.

87
00:03:51,880 --> 00:03:53,520
Oh really?

88
00:03:52,430 --> 00:03:54,750
Yeah. It's freakin' tasty, right?

89
00:03:55,680 --> 00:03:57,740
That is scary.

90
00:03:55,680 --> 00:03:57,740
Woah that's scary.

91
00:03:56,510 --> 00:03:58,270
It's freakin' tasty, right?

92
00:03:57,740 --> 00:03:59,740
His teeth are dirty.

93
00:03:58,520 --> 00:03:59,740
His teeth are dirty.

94
00:03:59,740 --> 00:04:01,740
What's wrong with him?

95
00:04:02,640 --> 00:04:06,220
Humans have a light and dark side.

96
00:04:06,220 --> 00:04:10,940
But there are few who so openly show their dark side on camera.

97
00:04:10,940 --> 00:04:14,280
And all while sitting outside the entrance of a convenience store.

98
00:04:16,140 --> 00:04:22,760
The familiar sight of the man who smiles shyly was no longer there.

99
00:04:25,500 --> 00:04:28,730
Something is wrong.

100
00:04:28,730 --> 00:04:30,730
Yeah, something is wrong here.

101
00:04:31,280 --> 00:04:33,580
You got married, huh.

102
00:04:32,560 --> 00:04:35,000
Yes, thank you.

103
00:04:34,360 --> 00:04:37,160
Do you boink her?

104
00:04:35,680 --> 00:04:38,680
Pardon?

105
00:04:37,850 --> 00:04:39,790
Do you boink her?

106
00:04:39,790 --> 00:04:42,010
My wife?

107
00:04:42,010 --> 00:04:45,800
Well yeah, we've got to make babies so....

108
00:04:45,800 --> 00:04:48,990
Are ya gonna do it today?

109
00:04:47,710 --> 00:04:49,400
Today!?

110
00:04:47,710 --> 00:04:49,400
Today!?

111
00:04:48,990 --> 00:04:51,710
I won't be doing it today but...

112
00:04:51,710 --> 00:04:54,030
Do you often talk about that sort of stuff?

113
00:04:54,030 --> 00:04:56,030
About what?

114
00:04:54,460 --> 00:04:58,460
In private....do you talk about those sort of dirty topics?

115
00:04:58,460 --> 00:05:02,270
Oh yeah, I'm totally erotic.

116
00:05:02,270 --> 00:05:04,000
Yeah.

117
00:05:04,000 --> 00:05:08,650
I really love threesomes in real life too.

118
00:05:08,650 --> 00:05:10,650
This isn't like Tanaka at all.

119
00:05:10,650 --> 00:05:13,690
He's not used to sitting like that, so his ass touches the ground!

120
00:05:14,860 --> 00:05:18,300
This change within Tanaka must stem from....

121
00:05:19,200 --> 00:05:23,450
(His life) seems boring!

122
00:05:24,680 --> 00:05:27,470
So that's how I seem to you, is it?

123
00:05:25,690 --> 00:05:27,690
The heck is that?

124
00:05:27,690 --> 00:05:33,240
Could he have been deeply hurt from Matsumoto's words?

125
00:05:33,240 --> 00:05:36,170
Not at all, Eraser (Staff's nickname).

126
00:05:35,070 --> 00:05:37,370
I'm starting to feel responsible for this, Endo!

127
00:05:36,170 --> 00:05:41,280
(Matsumoto-san) said that from what he imagined about my life, right?

128
00:05:41,280 --> 00:05:47,020
I mean, of course I love him (Matsumoto-san)....yeah.

129
00:05:47,020 --> 00:05:49,020
Uh-huh....for sure.

130
00:05:50,140 --> 00:05:53,610
But this is what I'm actually like usually.

131
00:05:54,810 --> 00:05:59,820
We were confused. This was definitely not the Tanaka we knew.

132
00:06:01,820 --> 00:06:05,640
He should be such a pure hearted man that

133
00:06:05,640 --> 00:06:09,470
even cries after being intimidated by Hamada.

134
00:06:12,910 --> 00:06:16,110
Oh man this is scary. I don't wanna see Tanaka like this.

135
00:06:16,700 --> 00:06:19,470
An optician's store.

136
00:06:20,480 --> 00:06:22,060
Look!

137
00:06:22,060 --> 00:06:23,600
Woah, cheap.

138
00:06:29,180 --> 00:06:31,640
Ahhh...that's nice.

139
00:06:31,390 --> 00:06:32,460
Oh really?

140
00:06:31,640 --> 00:06:32,460
Yeah.

141
00:06:32,460 --> 00:06:37,420
Tanaka's two juniors sighed as they revealed that they are

142
00:06:37,420 --> 00:06:41,310
now always made to wander around town with him like this.

143
00:06:41,310 --> 00:06:44,520
Difficult choice!

144
00:06:45,710 --> 00:06:48,560
It's so cheap!

145
00:06:47,050 --> 00:06:49,150
It is very cheap.

146
00:06:54,220 --> 00:06:57,550
What!? What are you doing?

147
00:06:56,990 --> 00:06:58,910
What?

148
00:06:57,660 --> 00:06:59,660
That's dirty.

149
00:06:59,660 --> 00:07:02,270
I'm suuuper thirsty.

150
00:07:02,270 --> 00:07:03,950
We'll buy you water then!

151
00:07:03,950 --> 00:07:07,040
No, no, that's fine. Look what's written here.

152
00:07:06,970 --> 00:07:09,340
"Please freely use this ultrasonic wave cleaner"

153
00:07:07,040 --> 00:07:09,580
Well yeah, it says "Please use freely" but...

154
00:07:09,580 --> 00:07:12,440
Ain't it totally funny though?

155
00:07:12,440 --> 00:07:16,430
Ain't it totally funny to drink from the washing basin?

156
00:07:16,430 --> 00:07:18,780
No, stop! Just stop!

157
00:07:18,010 --> 00:07:22,720
Without concern about people seeing him, he quenches his thirst from a washing basin.

158
00:07:24,720 --> 00:07:27,820
They had no choice but to smile awkwardly.

159
00:07:28,760 --> 00:07:31,770
I drank three tubs! HAAHAHAH!

160
00:07:35,640 --> 00:07:39,840
There was no goal to his wanderings.

161
00:07:45,050 --> 00:07:47,310
Just a sec.

162
00:07:46,700 --> 00:07:48,160
Sure.

163
00:07:48,140 --> 00:07:50,080
Hello?

164
00:07:50,890 --> 00:07:52,240
Yeah.

165
00:07:52,840 --> 00:07:54,240
Yeah.

166
00:07:54,560 --> 00:07:56,540
WHY THE FUCK!?

167
00:07:56,540 --> 00:08:00,250
WHY THE FUCK DO I HAVE TO START SO EARLY!?

168
00:08:00,250 --> 00:08:02,250
EHHH!?

169
00:08:02,780 --> 00:08:08,840
WHAT DOES IKUE AND NAOMI AND SHIT HAVE TO DO WITH ANYTHING!?

170
00:08:08,840 --> 00:08:11,950
YEAH! I AIN'T GOIN!

171
00:08:12,940 --> 00:08:16,090
I SAID I AIN'T GOIN'!

172
00:08:16,090 --> 00:08:18,670
SO FUCKIN' WHAT!?

173
00:08:20,030 --> 00:08:22,960
TOO EARLY IDIOT!

174
00:08:21,720 --> 00:08:24,490
They're seeing him going berserk.

175
00:08:23,550 --> 00:08:27,100
We couldn't help but gasp.

176
00:08:28,680 --> 00:08:32,060
We even contemplated stopping the camera.

177
00:08:34,060 --> 00:08:36,700
I'm so pissed off.

178
00:08:36,700 --> 00:08:40,720
Did he have some trouble with his manager who just phoned him?

179
00:08:40,720 --> 00:08:43,210
Tanaka was terribly angered.

180
00:08:43,210 --> 00:08:45,440
When suddenly...

181
00:08:49,520 --> 00:08:52,140
You gotta be kidding?

182
00:08:54,940 --> 00:08:58,640
Is it okay for a comedian like this to exist?

183
00:08:59,560 --> 00:09:02,220
Is this okay for a comedian?

184
00:09:01,690 --> 00:09:03,870
No way, he's finished.

185
00:09:03,230 --> 00:09:05,930
We were left speechless from shock.

186
00:09:05,930 --> 00:09:09,210
But, this is what Tanaka is like now.

187
00:09:08,640 --> 00:09:11,210
He kicked it in a weird spot too.

188
00:09:10,590 --> 00:09:12,970
Is this kind of thing normal for him?

189
00:09:12,970 --> 00:09:15,320
Only recently....

190
00:09:15,320 --> 00:09:16,780
Sorry!

191
00:09:15,880 --> 00:09:18,360
LICENSE!

192
00:09:16,920 --> 00:09:18,350
Sorry!

193
00:09:18,360 --> 00:09:24,910
Sometime when my switch flicks, I think I get like that.

194
00:09:25,390 --> 00:09:29,770
Is it a bad thing? I dunno but...

195
00:09:30,330 --> 00:09:34,190
I do think "I want to be audacious".

196
00:09:36,600 --> 00:09:39,500
He does stuff like this recently!

197
00:09:38,060 --> 00:09:40,540
There was a senior like that before though.

198
00:09:40,540 --> 00:09:42,430
Yeah, I hated him.

199
00:09:43,150 --> 00:09:46,840
His eyes were shining suspiciously.

200
00:09:50,360 --> 00:09:54,720
2nd Day Of Filming

201
00:09:51,520 --> 00:09:56,350
The next day, we were witness to another unexpected side of the man.

202
00:09:58,270 --> 00:10:04,920
It was Tanaka Naoki absorbed in a game of mahjong amidst a choking haze of smoke.

203
00:10:05,630 --> 00:10:10,940
Recently, I'll come twice a week if I can.

204
00:10:10,940 --> 00:10:14,860
Sometimes I finish work and go straight to a mahjong house and...

205
00:10:14,860 --> 00:10:18,830
sometimes I finish work and go straight to my mistress's place.

206
00:10:18,830 --> 00:10:21,900
He has never even used the word mistress before!

207
00:10:21,900 --> 00:10:23,440
I don't wanna see Tanaka like this!

208
00:10:24,300 --> 00:10:26,780
It was one surprise after another.

209
00:10:26,780 --> 00:10:30,780
The smell of trouble had become even stronger than before.

210
00:10:32,030 --> 00:10:34,190
See, he's distressed right?

211
00:10:32,300 --> 00:10:36,520
3rd Day Of Filming

212
00:10:33,080 --> 00:10:35,050
Yeah he is.

213
00:10:33,370 --> 00:10:36,330
The next day, Tanaka himself invited us to meet up with him.

214
00:10:36,750 --> 00:10:40,330
Sorry, since it's your day off.

215
00:10:38,570 --> 00:10:40,320
Uh yeah, no problem.

216
00:10:42,620 --> 00:10:46,090
(Staff) This is your car, Tanaka-san?

217
00:10:46,090 --> 00:10:48,090
Yeah.

218
00:10:48,840 --> 00:10:50,890
(Staff) The much rumoured about car.

219
00:10:51,450 --> 00:10:53,770
(Staff) Have you had it for quite a long time?

220
00:10:53,770 --> 00:10:56,010
No, about 7 years.

221
00:10:57,320 --> 00:11:02,090
Tanaka's driving was surprisingly calmer than we expected.

222
00:11:02,780 --> 00:11:05,710
In addition, he was very cautious.

223
00:11:05,710 --> 00:11:08,350
You're always following me now.

224
00:11:08,350 --> 00:11:11,470
(Staff) Well, we heard that you had changed, Tanaka-san.

225
00:11:11,470 --> 00:11:14,410
I guess I can be a bit messed up.

226
00:11:15,640 --> 00:11:19,530
Speaking of messed up, see his dirty hands....

227
00:11:20,080 --> 00:11:26,810
(Staff) Don't you clean your hands? And your teeth.

228
00:11:31,230 --> 00:11:36,570
That smile is like Matsuda Yusaku in "Black Rain".

229
00:11:37,360 --> 00:11:40,110
Tanaka turned his attention to in front of him.

230
00:11:40,110 --> 00:11:44,110
A German made car is blocking the entrance to a parking lot.

231
00:11:44,570 --> 00:11:47,530
(Staff) Should I ask him to move?

232
00:11:50,360 --> 00:11:53,160
Just hold on a second.

233
00:11:51,500 --> 00:11:53,980
No, stop, stop!

234
00:11:52,680 --> 00:11:54,890
He has such a short temper.

235
00:11:54,060 --> 00:11:56,720
The nightmare from the shopping centre was revived.

236
00:11:56,720 --> 00:11:59,690
No one can stop an angry Tanaka.

237
00:12:01,150 --> 00:12:03,150
What'cha doin'?

238
00:12:03,150 --> 00:12:06,110
You're in the way.

239
00:12:06,110 --> 00:12:07,880
OI!

240
00:12:07,880 --> 00:12:09,710
Where the heck are you parking it, you f**k?

241
00:12:08,830 --> 00:12:10,430
Oh, sorry.

242
00:12:09,710 --> 00:12:11,710
YOU'RE IN THE WAY!

243
00:12:10,570 --> 00:12:12,240
Yes, sorry.

244
00:12:12,200 --> 00:12:14,830
WHERE DO YA THINK YOU'RE PARKIN'!?

245
00:12:13,200 --> 00:12:14,830
Sorry.

246
00:12:14,830 --> 00:12:16,830
OI!

247
00:12:16,830 --> 00:12:18,830
OI!

248
00:12:17,740 --> 00:12:19,210
Sorry.

249
00:12:19,880 --> 00:12:21,680
OI!

250
00:12:20,880 --> 00:12:22,350
Sorry.

251
00:12:22,090 --> 00:12:24,200
GET OUT!

252
00:12:22,960 --> 00:12:24,730
Yes, I'll go now.

253
00:12:24,480 --> 00:12:26,910
GO!

254
00:12:26,910 --> 00:12:28,910
GO!

255
00:12:30,640 --> 00:12:32,810
ARE YOU AN IDIOT!?

256
00:12:38,080 --> 00:12:42,670
Even we were terrified at his intense rage.

257
00:12:43,770 --> 00:12:47,000
I can't forgive shit like that.

258
00:12:47,640 --> 00:12:52,300
Tanaka currently has no control over his emotions.

259
00:12:53,150 --> 00:12:57,640
I guess, I want to be like a "dangerous man".

260
00:12:57,870 --> 00:13:02,080
(Staff)  Don't you worry about your public image as a talent?

261
00:13:02,080 --> 00:13:05,870
Why? Do you?

262
00:13:10,750 --> 00:13:12,360
Tanaka doesn't look at these things.

263
00:13:12,360 --> 00:13:14,730
(Staff) You seem to like erotic things, don't you?

264
00:13:14,730 --> 00:13:17,870
Uh-huh, I'm always thinking about erotic things.

265
00:13:20,780 --> 00:13:24,170
His rage and eros seems to be spiraling out of control.

266
00:13:24,540 --> 00:13:27,980
There is not even a shred of the old Tanaka from Cocorico.

267
00:13:29,160 --> 00:13:32,490
5th Day of Filming

268
00:13:29,880 --> 00:13:34,890
His erratic behaviour was even present when we met him in Shinjuku.

269
00:13:34,890 --> 00:13:36,890
OI!

270
00:13:36,890 --> 00:13:39,440
ERASER (STAFF)

271
00:13:41,150 --> 00:13:43,150
OI!

272
00:13:43,820 --> 00:13:45,240
(Staff) Good morning.

273
00:13:45,240 --> 00:13:48,800
Tanaka had arrived in a hearse.

274
00:13:49,000 --> 00:13:51,480
So sorry I'm late.

275
00:13:51,480 --> 00:13:54,240
(Staff) What's going on?

276
00:13:54,240 --> 00:13:59,580
I realised I was running late so I caught a ride with this guy, who happened to pass by.

277
00:14:01,290 --> 00:14:04,590
Thanks! Sorry.

278
00:14:07,660 --> 00:14:10,830
Looks so cool doesn't it?

279
00:14:10,830 --> 00:14:12,110
Wanna go then?

280
00:14:15,470 --> 00:14:21,340
At the sushi store he just takes the sushi and leaves the plate.

281
00:14:24,590 --> 00:14:27,320
Oh man this tastes awesome.

282
00:14:27,320 --> 00:14:30,030
The store owner could do nothing but grimace.

283
00:14:30,570 --> 00:14:34,110
6th Day of Shooting

284
00:14:31,160 --> 00:14:34,250
While in town, he found a drink machine.

285
00:14:34,250 --> 00:14:37,500
"Idiot"

286
00:14:37,640 --> 00:14:41,480
I do this every time I find a poster.

287
00:14:41,480 --> 00:14:43,480
Are you serious?

288
00:14:44,010 --> 00:14:47,210
When we asked his reason for doing this, he kept his mouth closed.

289
00:14:47,210 --> 00:14:50,620
Oh man this sucks. I wanna turn back time!

290
00:14:51,150 --> 00:14:55,470
7th Day Of Shooting

291
00:14:52,010 --> 00:14:55,420
It is apparent that this comedian, who should make people laugh,

292
00:14:55,420 --> 00:14:58,250
is carrying a considerable amount of stress.

293
00:14:58,250 --> 00:15:02,120
But it should be strictly forbidden to show this to the public.

294
00:15:03,120 --> 00:15:05,120
(Staff) Who is this?

295
00:15:05,120 --> 00:15:07,630
None of your business.

296
00:15:08,520 --> 00:15:14,000
And yet, Tanaka has shed his self restraint and is revealing his raw nature.

297
00:15:16,670 --> 00:15:21,020
Just where did that Tanaka of old disappear to...?

298
00:15:23,930 --> 00:15:27,360
8th Day Of Shooting

299
00:15:24,730 --> 00:15:28,600
License were called to come to a small shrine.

300
00:15:30,120 --> 00:15:32,030
Wanna feed them (pigeons)?

301
00:15:31,390 --> 00:15:32,750
Oh, can we?

302
00:15:32,030 --> 00:15:32,750
Yeah.

303
00:15:33,400 --> 00:15:37,680
The animal loving Tanaka experiences

304
00:15:37,680 --> 00:15:41,930
limitless joy from feeding the pigeons at this shrine.

305
00:15:43,000 --> 00:15:47,930
Quite a lot gather, so it's fun. Plus they're cute.

306
00:15:47,930 --> 00:15:49,930
<Staff> Do they come if you throw food?

307
00:15:48,970 --> 00:15:51,930
Yeah usually they do.

308
00:15:54,620 --> 00:15:56,620
But this day....

309
00:15:56,620 --> 00:15:59,680
They ain't comin' at all.

310
00:15:59,680 --> 00:16:02,240
Yo pops.

311
00:16:02,240 --> 00:16:04,880
Where're the pigeons today pops?

312
00:16:04,880 --> 00:16:08,000
Hey I'mma take some of this food.

313
00:16:10,000 --> 00:16:12,000
OOOOOOIIII!

314
00:16:16,400 --> 00:16:19,200
(Staff) The pigeons are c...

315
00:16:26,910 --> 00:16:32,160
Animals possess qualities that I don't have so...

316
00:16:33,390 --> 00:16:37,280
They're really impulsive, and they're all so different.

317
00:16:37,470 --> 00:16:43,420
They're so cool like that. Totally different.

318
00:16:43,420 --> 00:16:49,180
This is actually the real size of a poodle.

319
00:16:49,180 --> 00:16:51,740
Quite a lot of people don't know that.

320
00:16:51,740 --> 00:16:58,300
Most people think that Toy Poodles are real poodles.

321
00:16:58,300 --> 00:17:02,590
The only time he doesn't show anger, is when he is with animals.

322
00:17:04,350 --> 00:17:09,120
10th Day Of Shooting

323
00:17:05,280 --> 00:17:10,810
We wanted to see what was going on inside his heart.

324
00:17:10,810 --> 00:17:13,150
(Staff) Do you often come to this park?

325
00:17:13,150 --> 00:17:15,290
Yeah, I guess.

326
00:17:16,190 --> 00:17:22,030
I come when I'm frustrated and stuff.

327
00:17:23,020 --> 00:17:25,740
Yeah, like when I'm frustrated or...

328
00:17:24,430 --> 00:17:30,590
Tanaka, who invited us and the camera, was frustrated for some reason.

329
00:17:53,020 --> 00:17:56,460
Something was irritating Tanaka.

330
00:17:56,460 --> 00:17:59,320
But, what is it?

331
00:18:01,120 --> 00:18:03,120
Cheers!

332
00:18:01,880 --> 00:18:03,120
Cheers!

333
00:18:02,090 --> 00:18:05,790
12th Day Of Shooting

334
00:18:05,120 --> 00:18:09,000
The duo from License were worried about Tanaka.

335
00:18:09,000 --> 00:18:11,820
You're chugging it down today.

336
00:18:14,560 --> 00:18:17,160
Are you ok about your hands?

337
00:18:17,160 --> 00:18:20,830
He devours a spare rib with his dirty hands.

338
00:18:20,830 --> 00:18:22,350
You're eating a lot today.

339
00:18:24,220 --> 00:18:28,190
He shows an uncharacteristically large appetite, and a layer of grease on his lips.

340
00:18:28,190 --> 00:18:32,520
It was saddening for License to see their beloved senior, seemingly deteriorate each day.

341
00:18:36,890 --> 00:18:41,450
It's fine, it's fine. They're not fighting over there.

342
00:18:41,450 --> 00:18:44,280
I'll totally go over there, you know.

343
00:18:44,280 --> 00:18:45,790
Why're you getting excited?

344
00:18:46,170 --> 00:18:48,700
OWW that hurts!

345
00:18:48,320 --> 00:18:50,810
License didn't want to cause any trouble.

346
00:18:51,280 --> 00:18:54,080
And so, they just kept on drinking.

347
00:18:54,080 --> 00:18:58,830
Perhaps sensing his juniors anxiousness, Tanaka didn't go wild.

348
00:18:58,830 --> 00:19:00,570
I'm beginning to feel drunk.

349
00:19:00,570 --> 00:19:02,570
Oh really?

350
00:19:03,640 --> 00:19:07,130
We began to notice the sombre expression on his face.

351
00:19:07,770 --> 00:19:10,880
(Staff) How do you feel about License as your juniors?

352
00:19:10,880 --> 00:19:14,140
I like to look after them. Yeah.

353
00:19:14,140 --> 00:19:17,850
They come calling "Tanaka-san, Tanaka-san" for help too.

354
00:19:20,570 --> 00:19:24,320
It's fun right? Everyday.

355
00:19:21,760 --> 00:19:23,200
Yes.

356
00:19:24,320 --> 00:19:27,240
That's what I'm like everyday.

357
00:19:26,200 --> 00:19:27,240
Yes.

358
00:19:27,240 --> 00:19:29,240
Even when alone?

359
00:19:28,030 --> 00:19:30,030
Mm-hmm.

360
00:19:30,400 --> 00:19:35,760
I'm worried about when you're alone though. It's fine if we're with you but....

361
00:19:39,710 --> 00:19:41,710
What's wrong?

362
00:19:42,120 --> 00:19:44,190
Is he crying?

363
00:19:51,160 --> 00:19:53,160
He finally snapped.

364
00:20:00,190 --> 00:20:03,680
It's fun being with me everyday, right?

365
00:20:03,680 --> 00:20:05,680
Yes it is.

366
00:20:06,940 --> 00:20:09,740
I'm sorry if we said something to upset you.

367
00:20:10,520 --> 00:20:12,440
Sorry.

368
00:20:11,440 --> 00:20:13,500
Take a look at that.

369
00:20:12,540 --> 00:20:14,860
His face is like a Hannya.

370
00:20:14,860 --> 00:20:16,970
It's interesting, right?

371
00:20:16,970 --> 00:20:19,210
It's fun, right?

372
00:20:19,210 --> 00:20:22,270
Just how many times did he repeat those words?

373
00:20:28,360 --> 00:20:32,670
Something that was niggling Tanaka inside, was now tormenting him.

374
00:20:32,670 --> 00:20:36,760
But we don't know the truth behind Tanaka's tears.

375
00:20:36,760 --> 00:20:39,210
Sorry.

376
00:20:40,330 --> 00:20:42,330
He snapped.

377
00:20:43,480 --> 00:20:47,560
The next day, we were unable to contact Tanaka.

378
00:20:49,150 --> 00:20:52,520
13th Day Of Shooting

379
00:20:49,930 --> 00:20:52,620
We were worried about Tanaka.

380
00:20:52,860 --> 00:20:56,350
His manager revealed to us a location where Tanaka often visits.

381
00:20:56,350 --> 00:20:59,710
It was an entertainment district covered in colorful neon lights.

382
00:21:00,780 --> 00:21:04,620
Apparently, there is a store he recently frequents.

383
00:21:06,890 --> 00:21:10,860
There, we found Tanaka spilling with lust and desire.

384
00:21:11,550 --> 00:21:16,060
(Staff) Tanaka-san. Excuse me.

385
00:21:16,060 --> 00:21:18,590
You guys again?

386
00:21:18,590 --> 00:21:20,830
(Staff) You go to brothels?

387
00:21:19,680 --> 00:21:22,830
I do, I do, I do. I go quite often, actually.

388
00:21:23,160 --> 00:21:26,080
I probably go the most out of the Gaki members.

389
00:21:26,080 --> 00:21:28,400
(Staff) Matsumoto-san says he often goes too....

390
00:21:28,400 --> 00:21:30,650
Ohh yeah he does say that.

391
00:21:30,650 --> 00:21:33,260
I reckon I go more often that Matsumoto-san though.

392
00:21:33,260 --> 00:21:34,730
Mmhmm..

393
00:21:34,730 --> 00:21:38,400
We witnessed him putting up a front, and trying beat Matsumoto-san.

394
00:21:38,400 --> 00:21:40,510
What's this?

395
00:21:39,680 --> 00:21:41,950
Got it from a girl.

396
00:21:41,320 --> 00:21:43,320
From Ayumi-san?

397
00:21:41,950 --> 00:21:43,320
Yeah.

398
00:21:44,220 --> 00:21:50,760
The Tanaka Naoki we once knew, is now nowhere to be found.

399
00:21:51,120 --> 00:21:53,400
This is pretty serious stuff.

400
00:21:53,400 --> 00:21:59,390
It wouldn't feel strange at all if you switched Tanaka's face with Hamada's.

401
00:22:00,110 --> 00:22:02,220
That's his everyday life.

402
00:22:02,220 --> 00:22:05,180
But I only said that because I was asked though.

403
00:22:06,090 --> 00:22:07,950
It's part of a joke.

404
00:22:13,640 --> 00:22:16,880
But I only said it because I was asked.

405
00:22:16,880 --> 00:22:18,880
He's not here today either.

406
00:22:19,450 --> 00:22:20,880
Good morning.

407
00:22:24,570 --> 00:22:27,340
Put that away now.

408
00:22:27,340 --> 00:22:29,770
His hands a dirty too.

409
00:22:29,770 --> 00:22:32,490
It was my bad. I'm really sorry.

410
00:22:32,490 --> 00:22:34,490
It was really my bad.

411
00:22:34,490 --> 00:22:36,490
I really feel that way.

412
00:22:38,190 --> 00:22:40,490
Hey listen! He's trying to apologise!

413
00:22:40,490 --> 00:22:43,260
I'm not saying this lightly okay?

414
00:22:43,260 --> 00:22:45,710
I'm not upset at all about that.

415
00:22:45,710 --> 00:22:48,750
I really am like this everyday.

416
00:22:48,750 --> 00:22:50,720
You're not like this!

417
00:22:50,240 --> 00:22:52,060
This isn't Tanaka!

418
00:22:52,060 --> 00:22:54,400
I'm thinking of appearing on TV like this from now.

419
00:22:54,400 --> 00:22:55,850
That's not possible.

420
00:22:55,850 --> 00:22:59,040
There's no energy there at all.

421
00:22:59,040 --> 00:23:02,760
There's no energy because you're not comfortable doing this.

422
00:23:02,780 --> 00:23:05,820
I'm going ahead to the studio now.

423
00:23:05,820 --> 00:23:06,830
Yes.

424
00:23:06,830 --> 00:23:08,510
I'll go on ahead.

425
00:23:07,260 --> 00:23:09,260
You can't be on TV like that!

426
00:23:09,260 --> 00:23:10,700
Do you want an apology?

427
00:23:09,260 --> 00:23:10,920
You can't be on TV like that!

428
00:23:11,210 --> 00:23:12,920
Do you want an apology?

429
00:23:11,580 --> 00:23:12,920
Do you want an apology?

430
00:23:13,530 --> 00:23:15,690
TANAKAAA!

431
00:23:19,320 --> 00:23:21,200
Wow.

432
00:23:19,870 --> 00:23:22,830
It's over. It's all over for us.

433
00:23:22,830 --> 00:23:27,070
Did I really say something so bad?

434
00:23:27,070 --> 00:23:29,360
Well for him, it must have been, I guess.

435
00:23:29,360 --> 00:23:31,360
He's not listening to anything we say.

436
00:23:31,360 --> 00:23:34,540
More importantly, is he gonna appear on other shows like that too?

437
00:23:34,540 --> 00:23:37,370
STOP CHATTIN' AND HURRY YO ASSES UP!

438
00:23:37,370 --> 00:23:38,220
We'll go.

439
00:23:38,220 --> 00:23:39,630
I'VE BEEN WAITIN' ALL THAT TIME!

440
00:23:39,630 --> 00:23:42,320
AND YOU'RE JUST DILLY DALLYING AROUND!

441
00:23:42,320 --> 00:23:43,120
Let's go, let's go.

442
00:23:43,120 --> 00:23:45,120
LET'S GO!

443
00:23:45,120 --> 00:23:48,480
DILLY DALLYING THE FUCK AROUND!

444
00:23:48,480 --> 00:23:50,990
This is the last time I'll work together with him.

445
00:23:50,990 --> 00:23:52,990
LET'S GO!

446
00:23:51,950 --> 00:23:54,240
Hey Tanaka, let's break up.

447
00:23:54,240 --> 00:23:55,800
I can't take it.

448
00:23:55,800 --> 00:24:04,270
every item that Tanaka used

449
00:23:55,800 --> 00:24:04,270
This footage of us following Tanaka is fiction

450
00:23:55,800 --> 00:24:04,270
and every person Tanaka came in contact with

451
00:23:55,800 --> 00:24:04,270
were all priorly prepared for this act.
