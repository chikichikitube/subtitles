19
00:00:43,790 --> 00:00:44,990

00:00:49,760 --> 00:00:51,860
Oh really? We'll keep going

24
00:00:50,200 --> 00:00:51,860
Yeah

25
00:00:51,860 --> 00:00:54,430
But you're ****

26
00:00:55,400 --> 00:00:57,370
Please don't say I'm ****

27
00:00:57,900 --> 00:01:00,310

00:01:23,060 --> 00:01:27,930
Last year in October, when Hamada went against Team Matsumoto in golf

49
00:01:27,930 --> 00:01:30,370
Hamada lost

50
00:01:30,370 --> 00:01:33,340
And because of that, it was decided he would do a Batsu Game

51
00:01:33,340 --> 00:01:34,940
And that Batsu game would be...

52
00:01:39,880 --> 00:01:44,650
Currently, NTV do a 3 second advert 'NTV is now broadcasting'...

53
00:01:44,650 --> 00:01:50,620
And Hamada would have to do this for 24 hours live on TV...

54
00:01:52,090 --> 00:01:55,960
A few days ago, a press release was made for this Batsu Game

55
00:01:55,960 --> 00:02:00,800
And Hamada told everyone how he felt after doing it

56
00:02:01,700 --> 00:02:05,970
The next day, it became a huge thing in the newspapers

57
00:02:06,610 --> 00:02:10,940
The advert gets aired 32 times per day on NTV

58
00:02:10,940 --> 00:02:13,450
And Hamada must do all of that live...

59
00:02:14,610 --> 00:02:18,380
24 hours- Hamada Masatoshi- Now broadcasting

60
00:02:18,950 --> 00:02:20,850
I bet you only saw a few...

61
00:02:20,850 --> 00:02:22,720
19th April, early in the morning

62
00:02:22,720 --> 00:02:27,760
Through the rain, the car carrying Hamada arrives at NTV

63
00:02:40,270 --> 00:02:41,840
Morning...

64
00:02:42,680 --> 00:02:43,880
This way, please...

65
00:02:56,020 --> 00:02:58,290
I'm going to fuck around in the first one for sure

66
00:03:01,860 --> 00:03:04,730
And then go home and sleep

67
00:03:05,230 --> 00:03:09,800
Hamada waits for the first advert, when the phone rings

68
00:03:12,170 --> 00:03:14,870
A phone call from Matsumoto-san...

69
00:03:12,170 --> 00:03:14,870

So umm...

We're going to make you dress up loads

90
00:03:55,680 --> 00:03:56,450
But you'll still

91
00:03:56,450 --> 00:03:57,780

92
00:03:57,580 --> 00:04:00,090
Yeah, I know that I'm going to be changing into different costumes...

93
00:04:02,420 --> 00:04:05,320

00:04:05,320 --> 00:04:07,190

101
00:04:11,460 --> 00:04:16,940
will be sent by Matsumoto via fax

102
00:04:12,230 --> 00:04:14,530

The first fax arrives from Matsumoto

113
00:04:42,460 --> 00:04:43,800
Hamada-san...

114
00:04:43,800 --> 00:04:46,060
A fax has just come through

115
00:04:47,270 --> 00:04:49,700
Look at this, is that seriously the writing of a 35 year old man...?

116
00:04:50,400 --> 00:04:52,400
MISS S&M

117
00:04:52,870 --> 00:04:56,240
Is this seriously the writing of a man who's going to turn 36 in September...?

118
00:04:56,880 --> 00:04:58,940
What a lame ass this guy is...

119
00:05:00,080 --> 00:05:03,020
His first costume is Miss S&M...

120
00:05:03,020 --> 00:05:06,750
The time for him to appear closes in, so he gets ready...

121
00:05:09,520 --> 00:05:11,520
4 minutes to go...

122
00:05:14,160 --> 00:05:17,400

First advert is 15 seconds long

126
00:05:24,270 --> 00:05:26,270
Woah woah woah...

It's so cold!

128
00:05:30,140 --> 00:05:32,140

130
00:05:36,520 --> 00:05:38,350
Look at that...

131
00:05:38,350 --> 00:05:40,350

139
00:06:10,120 --> 00:06:12,080
It finished...

140
00:06:15,120 --> 00:06:17,420
You really don't have time to say what you want

141
00:06:18,690 --> 00:06:20,360
A fax from Matsumoto-san...

142

00:06:20,990 --> 00:06:24,860
The next fax arrives from Matsumoto

144
00:06:22,690 --> 00:06:24,530
This is the fax

145
00:06:24,760 --> 00:06:26,530
Pink Lady...

146
00:06:26,530 --> 00:06:28,500
Please get going

147
00:06:29,600 --> 00:06:32,200
The next costume is Pink Lady

148
00:06:35,270 --> 00:06:37,640
He only has 10 minutes until the next advert

149
00:06:37,710 --> 00:06:42,010
so he gets changed in a hurry in a special box

150
00:06:51,690 --> 00:06:54,060
Surely if a car passes, you won't be able to hear?

151
00:06:54,690 --> 00:06:57,300
5 seconds

152
00:06:58,230 --> 00:07:00,330
Damn...

153
00:06:59,830 --> 00:07:02,400
Sekai Marumie is also being broadcast...

154
00:07:04,300 --> 00:07:06,270
Okay...!

155
00:07:06,840 --> 00:07:09,340
Is this actually being broadcast on TV okay?

156
00:07:15,180 --> 00:07:17,950
Sekai Marumie is also being broadcast...

157
00:07:20,650 --> 00:07:23,990
They really can do this kind of stuff, huh...

158
00:07:26,090 --> 00:07:27,760
Wait, this isn't the time to be amazed...

159
00:07:27,760 --> 00:07:29,760
I want to go home for fuck's sake

160
00:07:30,960 --> 00:07:33,600
1 hour since the start

161
00:07:33,600 --> 00:07:36,230
A 3rd fax from Matsumoto arrives

162
00:07:37,270 --> 00:07:39,270
Muscle Man

163
00:07:47,250 --> 00:07:50,080
Will I be able to talk in this...?

164
00:07:48,280 --> 00:07:50,080
Yes...

165
00:07:56,120 --> 00:07:58,190
Why the fuck do I have to dress up as Muscle Man

166
00:08:00,790 --> 00:08:02,890
I just don't get why...

167
00:08:05,030 --> 00:08:08,900
This time, he enters the studio for the show "Jipang Asa 6"

168
00:08:09,200 --> 00:08:11,800
Kazue Sonomaru

169
00:08:09,200 --> 00:08:11,800
NTV TV announcer

170
00:08:09,630 --> 00:08:13,170
By the way Hashimoto-san,

171
00:08:13,970 --> 00:08:17,240
this guest right here has been standing right beside me since before we came back

172
00:08:17,310 --> 00:08:19,340
Downtown's Hamada Masatoshi-san has

173
00:08:19,340 --> 00:08:21,980
come to the studio. Good morning to you...

174
00:08:20,950 --> 00:08:21,980
Good morning...

175
00:08:23,280 --> 00:08:25,250
Really great work...

176
00:08:26,450 --> 00:08:29,820
Next is the 3 second advert

177
00:08:31,320 --> 00:08:34,230
Jipang Asa 6 is also

178
00:08:32,920 --> 00:08:34,230
broadcasting

179
00:08:39,130 --> 00:08:42,330
Jipang Asa 6 is also being broadcasted!

180
00:08:43,970 --> 00:08:46,100
Thank you so much for stopping by

181
00:08:46,610 --> 00:08:49,370
I never knew that you were that big but...

182
00:08:51,340 --> 00:08:54,250
But anyway Hirashi-san, about today's weather...

183
00:08:54,250 --> 00:08:56,080
It is as expected... rain...

184
00:08:56,850 --> 00:08:58,950
Oh fuck, I shouldn't be here should I...

185
00:09:00,050 --> 00:09:03,860
Right, so looking at this morning's weather...

186
00:09:03,220 --> 00:09:07,990
It went straight to the show from the advert

187
00:09:03,220 --> 00:09:07,990
and Hamada got in the way...

188
00:09:03,860 --> 00:09:07,160
I was just thinking, 'Why am I still on the TV'...

189
00:09:09,560 --> 00:09:12,330
Over 3 hours since the start...

190
00:09:11,930 --> 00:09:15,800
Female shell diver

191
00:09:12,330 --> 00:09:16,500
The next fax from Matsumoto said 'female shell diver'

192
00:09:18,100 --> 00:09:20,970
Why the hell do I have to be a diver...?.

193
00:09:21,770 --> 00:09:24,080
We've only done 3 so far...

194
00:09:24,540 --> 00:09:26,850
Why do I have to go here of all places...?

195
00:09:27,150 --> 00:09:28,680
Over here please

196
00:09:28,210 --> 00:09:29,880
Oh shut the hell up...

197
00:09:31,020 --> 00:09:32,780
Don't tell me like it's normal...

198
00:09:37,060 --> 00:09:38,890
Oh man, something's coming

199
00:09:41,260 --> 00:09:44,530
Super TV is also being broadcast

200
00:09:44,760 --> 00:09:47,100
And yes... the wind is getting stronger...

201
00:09:48,230 --> 00:09:50,470
There's only 4 minutes until the next advert

202
00:09:50,470 --> 00:09:52,170
Hamada rushes to get changed

203
00:09:52,170 --> 00:09:54,640
Matsumoto's fax says 'Stan Hansen' (wrestler)

204
00:09:52,600 --> 00:09:56,780
Stan Hansen

205
00:09:58,310 --> 00:10:00,150
45 seconds...

206
00:10:00,150 --> 00:10:02,180
I had no time here...

207
00:10:05,450 --> 00:10:07,420
Yeah...

208
00:10:11,590 --> 00:10:13,590
I don't get it...

209
00:10:14,960 --> 00:10:16,760
Fukuzawa Akira

210
00:10:14,960 --> 00:10:16,760
NTV announcer

211
00:10:15,190 --> 00:10:17,460
So you will say 'Zoom in Asa' also

212
00:10:19,660 --> 00:10:21,800
People on TV must be thinking, 'What the fuck'...

213
00:10:21,800 --> 00:10:23,770
Who the fuck am I meant to be...?

214
00:10:30,880 --> 00:10:33,650
Zoom in Asa is also

215
00:10:32,010 --> 00:10:33,650
being broadcast

216
00:10:36,580 --> 00:10:38,450
Okay, thank you very much

217
00:10:44,520 --> 00:10:48,760
It's 9am, and 5 adverts have been completed

218
00:10:49,360 --> 00:10:51,530
You can just cross out a few more as well, you know...

219
00:10:54,000 --> 00:10:57,970
Bunkin Takashimada

220
00:10:54,900 --> 00:10:59,170
Next fax from Matsumoto says 'Bunkin Takashimada'

221
00:10:59,400 --> 00:11:02,270
I just read your horoscope and...

222
00:11:02,240 --> 00:11:08,680
It says, 'People from the Year of the Bull will be forced into doing something annoying and dull'

223
00:11:04,610 --> 00:11:09,380
Hamada is born in May which is the Year of the Bull

224
00:11:08,780 --> 00:11:10,720
No way...!

225
00:11:11,750 --> 00:11:15,520
You will be forced into doing something annoying and dull...

226
00:11:18,090 --> 00:11:19,290
If you do this properly

227
00:11:19,290 --> 00:11:22,390
You can make that step up

228
00:11:23,530 --> 00:11:28,800
This time, he will be on 'Look Look', so he heads for the studio

229
00:11:30,770 --> 00:11:32,970
It's just news in the morning after all...

230
00:11:31,400 --> 00:11:35,570
Hamada waits to do his commercial shoot

231
00:11:35,970 --> 00:11:40,750
After the commercial, we will go to Wakabayashi-san's news corner...

232
00:11:41,280 --> 00:11:44,020
Please come over here

233
00:11:46,890 --> 00:11:49,320
Great this didn't become news on this day, eh...?

234
00:11:49,320 --> 00:11:51,320
Must be very tough...

235
00:11:49,920 --> 00:11:51,890
Masako Usui

236
00:11:49,920 --> 00:11:51,890
Fumio Matsunaga

237
00:11:49,920 --> 00:11:51,890
TV announcer

238
00:11:49,920 --> 00:11:51,890
TV announcer

239
00:11:52,290 --> 00:11:54,030
Yes it is, I don't know why I have to dress up like this

240
00:11:54,030 --> 00:11:55,060
15 seconds...

241
00:11:55,060 --> 00:11:57,630
Yeah, why do you have to dress up like this?

242
00:11:56,160 --> 00:11:57,630
I know, right...?

243
00:11:57,630 --> 00:11:59,460
Like, what's that all about...?

244
00:12:08,740 --> 00:12:11,940
Look Look is also being broadcast!

245
00:12:11,940 --> 00:12:14,550
Main headlines, what's on the newspaper!

246
00:12:14,550 --> 00:12:16,920
You just don't know what to say...

247
00:12:19,850 --> 00:12:24,090
Only 14 minutes until the next commercial, they go downstairs and wait...

248
00:12:24,390 --> 00:12:28,760
Speed skater

249
00:12:25,320 --> 00:12:27,630
That was a bit of a shock...

250
00:12:26,290 --> 00:12:27,630
Really...?

251
00:12:30,530 --> 00:12:33,900
He gets changed into a 'speed skater'...

252
00:12:39,600 --> 00:12:41,740
Why am I dressed like this...

253
00:12:42,470 --> 00:12:44,280
So what do I have to do...?

254
00:12:54,520 --> 00:12:56,960
Tuesday Suspense Drama is also being broadcast

255
00:13:05,660 --> 00:13:09,200
5 hours gone, we start to see fatigue on his face

256
00:13:09,200 --> 00:13:11,370
And his next costume will be...

257
00:13:17,080 --> 00:13:19,640
Warette Koraeta is also being broadcast...

Miniskirt Police woman

260
00:13:24,750 --> 00:13:27,490
Okay...

261
00:13:28,520 --> 00:13:32,490
11am, that man comes to visit

262
00:13:32,490 --> 00:13:34,490
Mornin'...

263
00:13:35,560 --> 00:13:37,630
Mornin'... You working hard...?

264
00:13:38,860 --> 00:13:40,600
It's so fucking obvious that you've just woken up

265
00:13:40,530 --> 00:13:43,800
Yamazaki Hosei

266
00:13:41,270 --> 00:13:42,300
No, no... not at all

267
00:13:42,300 --> 00:13:43,640
You haven't been watching, have you...

268
00:13:43,640 --> 00:13:46,100
No no no... anyway, here

269
00:13:46,400 --> 00:13:49,470
Don't you 'anyway, here' me... You've just woken up!

270
00:13:49,470 --> 00:13:51,510
You haven't been watching, have you...

271
00:13:54,350 --> 00:13:56,380
You working hard...?

272
00:13:56,380 --> 00:13:58,550
I've been thinking of a lot of ideas, too...

273
00:13:58,550 --> 00:14:00,350
And like about the

274
00:14:00,350 --> 00:14:01,720
costumes and stuff...

275
00:14:01,720 --> 00:14:03,720
Oh, just go home...

276
00:14:05,090 --> 00:14:07,290
Oh, it's come...

277
00:14:08,090 --> 00:14:10,260

Dango 3 Kyoudai has come through

280
00:14:16,200 --> 00:14:18,200
You do it for me

281
00:14:17,100 --> 00:14:18,200
No no no...

282
00:14:18,200 --> 00:14:20,410
I'll let you do it once, how does that sound...?

283
00:14:20,870 --> 00:14:24,080
I mean, in all seriousness I do really want to do it

284
00:14:24,580 --> 00:14:26,610
Dango 3 Kyoudai, right?

285
00:14:26,610 --> 00:14:29,410
I've got 3 ideas...

286
00:14:29,480 --> 00:14:34,290
So first off, I want you to be REALLY enthusiastic

287
00:14:35,720 --> 00:14:42,260
Dango 3 Kyoudai is also being broadcast

288
00:14:49,500 --> 00:14:52,400
Go ask the line I have to say next or something

289
00:14:52,400 --> 00:14:54,370
What does he have to say?

290
00:14:54,370 --> 00:14:56,370
Sanma Goten is also being broadcast

291
00:14:58,140 --> 00:15:00,150
'Sanma Goten is also being

292
00:15:00,150 --> 00:15:04,950
broadcast' whilst laughing and then at the end

293
00:15:07,750 --> 00:15:10,220
Show it to the camera or they won't understand...

294
00:15:11,720 --> 00:15:13,630
Do it like this

295
00:15:17,060 --> 00:15:18,560
Like this?

296
00:15:23,500 --> 00:15:26,100
Damn, that's an annoying face

297
00:15:25,970 --> 00:15:28,440
That's great, let's do that!

298
00:15:34,550 --> 00:15:36,680
Sanma Goten is also being broadcast!

299
00:15:45,090 --> 00:15:46,690
Okay

300
00:15:47,360 --> 00:15:48,790
That was great

301
00:15:48,790 --> 00:15:51,630
Wasn't that really lame?

302
00:15:49,860 --> 00:15:51,630
No no no...

303
00:15:51,630 --> 00:15:53,630
I mean you looked really ugly...

304
00:15:54,700 --> 00:15:55,730
But it was good

305
00:15:57,570 --> 00:16:00,540
And another fax came from Matsumoto...

306
00:16:00,540 --> 00:16:03,680
The next costume is 'stewardess'...

307
00:16:08,280 --> 00:16:11,180
Why does that guy not sleep...?

308
00:16:16,720 --> 00:16:18,690
That's true...

309
00:16:25,460 --> 00:16:27,600
Uta no Daijiten is also being broadcast

310
00:16:29,400 --> 00:16:31,470

9 hours since the start

312
00:16:39,010 --> 00:16:43,780
Gakideka

313
00:16:39,840 --> 00:16:44,980
His fatigue is reaching its limit but he's not even half way

314
00:16:44,980 --> 00:16:47,950
He gets himself together and heads to the studio

315
00:16:47,950 --> 00:16:49,950
This is the one I hated the most...

316
00:16:50,520 --> 00:16:52,120
This is the one I hated the most...

317
00:16:52,790 --> 00:16:54,690
Literally...

318
00:16:54,690 --> 00:16:56,690
Old women looking at me the whole time...

319
00:16:57,660 --> 00:16:59,430
Look at that...

320
00:16:59,760 --> 00:17:00,870
That would be awful

321
00:17:00,870 --> 00:17:03,870
The guests behind you are clueless as to what's going on...

322
00:17:04,900 --> 00:17:06,570
I know...

323
00:17:07,670 --> 00:17:09,970
Only person who's got a clue is Mino-san...

324
00:17:14,680 --> 00:17:17,450
Omoikiri TV is also being broadcast!

325
00:17:20,520 --> 00:17:22,250
Old women everywhere...

326
00:17:22,250 --> 00:17:23,420
That is tough

327
00:17:23,420 --> 00:17:25,990
Omoikiri TV is also being broadcast!

328
00:17:27,730 --> 00:17:31,330
Mino-san reacted fantastically to it...

329
00:17:32,730 --> 00:17:34,570
Poor him...

330
00:17:34,570 --> 00:17:36,800
Seriously, Hama-chan...

331
00:17:38,240 --> 00:17:41,010
After Gakideka is Onigawara Gonzou

332
00:17:39,600 --> 00:17:43,780
Onigawara Gonzou

333
00:17:41,010 --> 00:17:43,980
As he doesn't have much time, he gets changed quickly

334
00:17:45,540 --> 00:17:46,950
5 minutes...

335
00:17:46,950 --> 00:17:48,480
5 minutes...

336
00:17:48,480 --> 00:17:49,280
Yeah...

337
00:17:49,280 --> 00:17:51,250
Heipo, do it for me instead

338
00:17:52,950 --> 00:17:55,120
Toshide Saito

339
00:17:52,950 --> 00:17:55,120
World affiliated Heipo

340
00:18:04,030 --> 00:18:07,470
Romance is also being broadcasted...

341
00:18:08,900 --> 00:18:11,340
He's starting to get into it...

342
00:18:12,100 --> 00:18:16,570
The next costume is 'Kusano Hitoshi's clothes'

343
00:18:12,970 --> 00:18:15,870
Kusano Hitoshi

344
00:18:12,970 --> 00:18:15,870
Kusano Hitoshi's clothes

345
00:18:22,510 --> 00:18:25,780
We're literally shoving everything around the waist back

346
00:18:26,580 --> 00:18:30,960
so I look okay but these clothes are huge

347
00:18:30,960 --> 00:18:33,690
Barachiemon is also being broadcast!

348
00:18:34,930 --> 00:18:38,760
18 minutes until next commercial

349
00:18:36,260 --> 00:18:38,760
Great work...

350
00:18:41,530 --> 00:18:45,000
3 faxes come at once...

351
00:18:45,000 --> 00:18:46,400
Butcha...

352
00:18:46,400 --> 00:18:47,640
Security guard

353
00:18:47,640 --> 00:18:50,740
First up is Yatsu Hakamura

354
00:18:50,740 --> 00:18:53,540
Kamaitemo is also being broadcast!

355
00:18:53,340 --> 00:18:55,580
Kusano Hitoshi

356
00:18:53,340 --> 00:18:55,580
Mori Fumi

357
00:18:53,340 --> 00:18:55,580
NTV announcer

358
00:19:03,520 --> 00:19:09,160
Only 10 minutes until he must do a commercial dressed as Butcha in a cafe. Hurry Hamada!

359
00:19:09,060 --> 00:19:11,200
Butcha

360
00:19:09,160 --> 00:19:13,330
He runs dressed as Butcha and gets to the cafe just in time

361
00:19:20,740 --> 00:19:23,140
-ryori Show is also being broadcast

362
00:19:22,270 --> 00:19:24,380
Damn it, they didn't get all of it in...

363
00:19:31,650 --> 00:19:34,490
Next is an NTV security guard

364
00:19:34,490 --> 00:19:37,860
He walks in the restrictive Butcha costume

365
00:19:35,920 --> 00:19:39,190
Security guard

366
00:19:37,860 --> 00:19:39,890
Hang in there, Hamada

367
00:19:39,890 --> 00:19:41,860
I've had enough

368
00:19:43,060 --> 00:19:44,730
It's seriously enough

369
00:19:45,230 --> 00:19:49,230
This time, he will stand in front of the NTV main entrance and do the commercial

370
00:19:49,900 --> 00:19:54,540
A lot of fans come to watch, and Hamada arrives dressed as a security guard

371
00:19:54,540 --> 00:19:57,080
Why the hell do I have to protect NTV...

372
00:20:06,850 --> 00:20:10,150
Downtown Deluxe is also being broadcast

373
00:20:11,020 --> 00:20:12,790
Okay, great

374
00:20:12,890 --> 00:20:16,160
Now, we have done 16 commercials...

375
00:20:19,660 --> 00:20:22,800
It's been 12 hours since he arrived at NTV

376
00:20:22,800 --> 00:20:25,870
and Hamada is reaching his limit

377
00:20:27,370 --> 00:20:28,670
So cold...

378
00:20:29,870 --> 00:20:33,850
As soon as he lies down, he falls asleep...

379
00:20:34,350 --> 00:20:36,380
You've got two minutes...

380
00:20:38,150 --> 00:20:40,450
2 minutes, 2 minutes!

381
00:20:40,890 --> 00:20:42,550
Yeah...

382
00:20:45,520 --> 00:20:48,790
Nandarou-kun

383
00:20:45,520 --> 00:20:48,790
Next is a 15 second commercial

384
00:20:45,620 --> 00:20:48,990
For the next one, he must dress up as Nandarou-kun and do a 15 second long version

385
00:20:53,630 --> 00:20:57,740
I'm Hamada Masatoshi doing the 24 hour broadcast

386
00:20:57,740 --> 00:21:01,340
I've just gotten to the half way point, another 16 times

387
00:21:01,340 --> 00:21:03,470
I'm going to raise my spirit and do it!

388
00:21:03,470 --> 00:21:06,340
NTV broadcast, Gaki no Tsukai broadcast!

389
00:21:06,340 --> 00:21:07,480
Ahhh!!!

390
00:21:11,320 --> 00:21:17,160
Hamada finally gets to the halfway point... What lies ahead for Hamada...?

391
00:21:17,360 --> 00:21:19,890
Damn...

392
00:21:19,890 --> 00:21:20,860
That was seriously something

393
00:21:20,860 --> 00:21:24,600
It must be really tough to meet the other celebrities

394
00:21:24,600 --> 00:21:27,330
And the other people are like 'what the hell is he doing'...

395
00:21:26,330 --> 00:21:27,330
Yeah...

396
00:21:27,800 --> 00:21:28,800
And give me horrid looks, right?

397
00:21:28,800 --> 00:21:31,770
Like when you went to that one in particular...

398
00:21:31,770 --> 00:21:33,670
That must have been really tough

399
00:21:33,670 --> 00:21:35,770
Those old women don't know anything...

400
00:21:36,840 --> 00:21:39,110
Did you guys actually see any?

401
00:21:40,010 --> 00:21:42,680
How many? Surely not many...

402
00:21:42,680 --> 00:21:44,420
1...?

403
00:21:44,420 --> 00:21:47,150
So they just had the TV on and coincidentally saw you...

404
00:21:47,550 --> 00:21:48,820
Anyone could see you once...

405
00:21:48,820 --> 00:21:50,560
You see him just as much on a daily basis...

406
00:21:50,560 --> 00:21:51,420
Yeah...

407
00:21:53,620 --> 00:21:56,160
Wait, is there anyone who watched ALL of them?

408
00:21:56,160 --> 00:21:57,400
Yeah, that would be amazing

409
00:21:57,400 --> 00:21:59,160
No way...

410
00:21:59,160 --> 00:22:01,600
You know, like

411
00:22:01,600 --> 00:22:04,540
if it said like, 'what time I would be on TV'

412
00:22:03,030 --> 00:22:04,540
Yeah, that's true

413
00:22:04,540 --> 00:22:05,200
That's true

414
00:22:05,200 --> 00:22:07,910
So they could just switch the channel then

415
00:22:07,910 --> 00:22:09,870
Otherwise, you have to have the channel on the whole time

416
00:22:09,870 --> 00:22:12,410
And plus, this wasn't about Ma-chan, it was only Hama-chan...

417
00:22:15,580 --> 00:22:20,250
I really got the whole 'but it's only Hama-chan' kind of feeling...

418
00:22:20,590 --> 00:22:25,420
I really felt that... you're just such an incomplete person

419
00:22:27,020 --> 00:22:29,060
I don't feel that...

420
00:22:30,160 --> 00:22:32,560
I see... so no one watched all of them...

421
00:22:32,560 --> 00:22:34,700
Obviously

422
00:22:34,700 --> 00:22:38,300
But sometimes, I did it outside so some people came to watch

423
00:22:38,300 --> 00:22:41,270
Oh yeah, but that was for the Janiizu

424
00:22:42,170 --> 00:22:43,370
Oh, so they actually wanted to see someone from Janiizu

425
00:22:43,370 --> 00:22:45,640
And coincidentally, Hamada-san was there

426
00:22:45,640 --> 00:22:47,850
What the hell are Janiizu doing at NTV?

427
00:22:47,850 --> 00:22:50,210
They were saying 'who's that, who's that?'

428
00:22:50,210 --> 00:22:51,980
No they weren't!

429
00:22:51,980 --> 00:22:53,450
They didn't know it was you

430
00:22:52,450 --> 00:22:53,450
Not at all?

431
00:22:53,450 --> 00:22:54,890
They didn't have a clue

432
00:22:55,220 --> 00:22:57,860
Seriously?

433
00:22:55,720 --> 00:22:57,860
Even when they see him?

434
00:22:58,360 --> 00:23:00,520
I swear he's really famous...

435
00:23:01,430 --> 00:23:04,160
They call him the 'smaller one out of Ichan Nanchan'...

436
00:23:05,260 --> 00:23:06,860
What...?

437
00:23:06,860 --> 00:23:08,880
Is that all...?

438
00:23:08,740 --> 00:23:11,750
Downtown

439
00:23:08,740 --> 00:23:11,750
Hamada Masatoshi

440
00:23:09,210 --> 00:23:13,380
The 2nd half starts... only 16 more commercials to do

441
00:23:13,280 --> 00:23:17,920
Just when he got past the half way mark

442
00:23:13,280 --> 00:23:17,920
he gets 3 faxes from Matsumoto

443
00:23:13,380 --> 00:23:17,620
here he gets 3 faxes from Matsumoto about his costumes...

444
00:23:17,620 --> 00:23:20,690
Hamada, who cannot hide his fatigue, lets out a large sigh

445
00:23:24,090 --> 00:23:29,060
They move to the NTV Talent Cloak room and he dresses up as an 'eccentric young boy'

446
00:23:28,600 --> 00:23:31,670
Eccentric young boy

447
00:23:29,060 --> 00:23:31,070
City Hunter...

448
00:23:31,900 --> 00:23:34,170
I have to talk about fucking City Hunter as well...?

449
00:23:37,010 --> 00:23:39,140
I think for this one, I'll look to the side...

450
00:23:48,880 --> 00:23:52,090
City Hunter is also being broadcast

451
00:23:57,130 --> 00:24:00,400
Chaplin

452
00:23:57,660 --> 00:24:02,200
He only has a short time, and next up is Charlie Chaplin

453
00:24:02,200 --> 00:24:08,200
The next thing you will say is 'Itouke no Shokutaku' is also being broadcast

454
00:24:08,840 --> 00:24:11,770
Itouke no Shokutaku you say...?

455
00:24:13,840 --> 00:24:18,150
Why the hell do I have to say Itouke no Shokutaku is also being broadcast...

456
00:24:18,480 --> 00:24:20,180
Oh, hello there...

457
00:24:21,550 --> 00:24:25,520
Came to record for his program 'Itouke no Shokutaku'

458
00:24:21,550 --> 00:24:25,520
Ito Shiro

459
00:24:23,180 --> 00:24:25,920
I heard some bad mouthing about my program...

460
00:24:26,890 --> 00:24:29,020
Like 'What the hell is Itouke's...'

461
00:24:29,490 --> 00:24:30,330
No no, not at all

462
00:24:30,330 --> 00:24:32,330
What are you doing?

463
00:24:30,730 --> 00:24:32,330
Well, what are you doing?

464
00:24:32,330 --> 00:24:34,560
What you mean what am I doing? I'm here to record my show...

465
00:24:34,560 --> 00:24:36,560
Oh, you're here today for a shoot?

466
00:24:36,560 --> 00:24:39,330
Well I'm advertising for you today...

467
00:24:39,330 --> 00:24:41,940
Oh really?

468
00:24:39,930 --> 00:24:41,940
Actually, would you please do it with me...?

469
00:24:41,940 --> 00:24:43,570
Since you're here, I've been

470
00:24:43,570 --> 00:24:45,440
doing it alone the whole time

471
00:24:45,440 --> 00:24:47,640
please, just once, go on...

472
00:24:46,040 --> 00:24:47,640
No...

473
00:24:47,640 --> 00:24:49,640
It's just 3 seconds!

474
00:24:54,050 --> 00:24:55,380
15 seconds before we shoot...

475
00:24:55,380 --> 00:24:57,390
Wow, there's 15 seconds worth of advertising...

476
00:24:57,390 --> 00:24:59,390
No no...

477
00:24:59,390 --> 00:25:01,390
Countdown from 10

478
00:25:08,100 --> 00:25:10,970
Itouke no Shokutaku is also being broadcast!

479
00:25:17,740 --> 00:25:19,370
Thank you very much

480
00:25:22,080 --> 00:25:26,080
White Swan

481
00:25:22,610 --> 00:25:26,820
The next one is in 8 minutes, and he must change into a white swan quickly

482
00:25:29,020 --> 00:25:30,020
That's great

483
00:25:38,590 --> 00:25:41,400
Sekkai Marumie is also being broadcast

484
00:25:46,700 --> 00:25:48,400
Hahaha!

485
00:25:50,440 --> 00:25:51,510
That's hilarious

486
00:25:51,910 --> 00:25:53,440
Brilliant

487
00:25:54,080 --> 00:25:55,740
That was funny

488
00:25:55,740 --> 00:25:57,280
You now have a bit of free time...

489
00:25:57,280 --> 00:25:59,280
You have some time off now

490
00:26:00,010 --> 00:26:02,020
Great work

491
00:26:02,820 --> 00:26:04,520
Hamada goes to sleep

492
00:26:04,520 --> 00:26:06,520
SHUT THE FUCK UP

493
00:26:06,890 --> 00:26:08,220
HEY

494
00:26:10,530 --> 00:26:16,800
He finally gets some rest... Even though it's only an hour, Hamada sleeps deeply

495
00:26:12,060 --> 00:26:13,900
This isn't right

496
00:26:13,060 --> 00:26:13,900
Yeah

497
00:26:13,900 --> 00:26:15,900
You shouldn't be allowed to sleep

498
00:26:21,840 --> 00:26:24,410
Excuse me, we need you to start getting ready

499
00:26:28,740 --> 00:26:30,250
If you would...

500
00:26:37,990 --> 00:26:40,520
Matsumoto's next order...

501
00:26:42,020 --> 00:26:43,690
Tamori

502
00:26:43,690 --> 00:26:45,690
Damn man...

503
00:26:44,390 --> 00:26:48,200
Tamori

504
00:26:47,300 --> 00:26:49,530
You look so old...

505
00:26:47,660 --> 00:26:51,600
He will now go to News Plus 1's weather report to shoot the commercial

506
00:26:51,670 --> 00:26:55,540
He will do the commercial next to the "News Plus 1 weather report"

507
00:26:58,570 --> 00:27:01,540
Look, they're shouting 'who is that'...

508
00:26:59,970 --> 00:27:01,540
Like hell they are...

509
00:27:08,420 --> 00:27:09,580
Te-...

510
00:27:11,820 --> 00:27:13,690
What the hell was that?

511
00:27:13,690 --> 00:27:15,690
They screwed up

512
00:27:17,660 --> 00:27:19,730
It finished...

513
00:27:20,460 --> 00:27:24,170
However, due to a mistake from the staff, came the first failure...

514
00:27:24,330 --> 00:27:26,570
Another order from that man...

515
00:27:25,730 --> 00:27:29,540
When he returns, another order from Matsumoto

516
00:27:27,970 --> 00:27:30,810
Sorry... but that one doesn't count.

517
00:27:31,940 --> 00:27:33,710
So you'll do it again

518
00:27:34,140 --> 00:27:36,110
I've got to do it again...?

519
00:27:37,950 --> 00:27:39,210
What the hell man...

520
00:27:38,750 --> 00:27:40,780
So he will do it as Tamori again

521
00:27:44,120 --> 00:27:46,690
Romance is awesome again tonight...

522
00:27:54,560 --> 00:27:56,000
Was that okay?

523
00:27:56,000 --> 00:27:57,700
Yup, that was brilliant

524
00:27:58,870 --> 00:28:00,940
You just changed the wording...

525
00:28:05,040 --> 00:28:10,580
Next order is to borrow Takeshi-san from Sekai Marumie's costume

526
00:28:10,580 --> 00:28:14,180
What kind of costume will he go for...

527
00:28:11,280 --> 00:28:15,420
Something Takeshi-san
has worn

528
00:28:23,460 --> 00:28:26,190
Damn, this is amazing

529
00:28:27,660 --> 00:28:30,000
He has so many...

530
00:28:32,500 --> 00:28:35,270
Can I borrow this one, then?

531
00:28:34,300 --> 00:28:35,270
Yes.

532
00:28:35,540 --> 00:28:40,070
Beat Takeshi

533
00:28:35,540 --> 00:28:40,070
Takeshi wore this in his program

534
00:28:35,540 --> 00:28:40,070
called: Momotarou Zamurai

535
00:28:36,770 --> 00:28:40,580
The one chosen was Momoratou Zamurai's costume...

536
00:28:44,980 --> 00:28:47,820
Labyrinth is being prepared

537
00:29:01,300 --> 00:29:05,670
9pm. Only 8 more to go. Here, those two guys arrive.

538
00:29:05,970 --> 00:29:07,700
Hello!

539
00:29:07,700 --> 00:29:09,300
Hello!

540
00:29:09,300 --> 00:29:11,740
Great work

541
00:29:10,200 --> 00:29:11,740
Great work

542
00:29:11,740 --> 00:29:12,870
Hello

543
00:29:12,870 --> 00:29:14,610
Hello

544
00:29:14,210 --> 00:29:17,880
Endo Shozo

545
00:29:14,210 --> 00:29:17,880
Cocorico

546
00:29:14,210 --> 00:29:17,880
Tanaka Naoki

547
00:29:14,610 --> 00:29:18,410
So we are here to */$£&$*

548
00:29:18,410 --> 00:29:20,420
Oh man, we don't understand what you're trying to say

549
00:29:20,420 --> 00:29:22,420
You do realise you're not funny at all, right?

550
00:29:23,820 --> 00:29:28,860
We wanted you to do

551
00:29:26,490 --> 00:29:28,860
this 'Yasugibishi'

552
00:29:28,960 --> 00:29:30,660
No, no, I'm fine

553
00:29:30,660 --> 00:29:33,900
That's like... Tanaka's thing

554
00:29:34,330 --> 00:29:35,430
You know?

555
00:29:35,460 --> 00:29:37,700
It's no one's thing...

556
00:29:38,200 --> 00:29:39,870
Get him a tissue

557
00:29:40,570 --> 00:29:42,200
That's great

558
00:29:42,540 --> 00:29:44,340
Don't be ridiculous

559
00:29:44,340 --> 00:29:45,510
That's perfect

560
00:29:45,510 --> 00:29:47,810
You know what they do, right?

561
00:29:47,810 --> 00:29:50,340
I don't know

562
00:29:48,710 --> 00:29:50,340
You know what I'm talking about

563
00:29:50,750 --> 00:29:52,480
Like this

564
00:29:53,750 --> 00:29:56,580
Yasuki-...

565
00:29:56,580 --> 00:29:58,590
Like this... put your shoulder into it

566
00:29:58,590 --> 00:30:00,590
Your shoulder, like this

567
00:30:02,020 --> 00:30:04,430
And then pretend you found something...

568
00:30:04,430 --> 00:30:06,430
Wait... It's only 3 seconds long

569
00:30:07,360 --> 00:30:09,730
No, you'll be able to get to that point

570
00:30:09,030 --> 00:30:09,730
True

571
00:30:09,730 --> 00:30:13,270
So search for it like this

572
00:30:11,800 --> 00:30:13,270
The bum is important here

573
00:30:14,040 --> 00:30:15,570
Please try it, Hamada-san

574
00:30:18,270 --> 00:30:20,210
And then you find it...

575
00:30:20,210 --> 00:30:21,810
So you find it, and please go and get it

576
00:30:21,810 --> 00:30:23,810
I said it's only 3 seconds long!

577
00:30:23,910 --> 00:30:25,050
What do you have to say next?

578
00:30:25,050 --> 00:30:26,610
It's

579
00:30:26,610 --> 00:30:29,220
Labyrinth is also being broadcast and that's fine but

580
00:30:28,250 --> 00:30:29,220
No, it's 'being prepared'

581
00:30:29,220 --> 00:30:31,520
But since you're doing yasugibushi

582
00:30:31,520 --> 00:30:34,290
So let's say 'Yasugibushi is also being broadcast'

583
00:30:35,520 --> 00:30:37,330
But it's got nothing to do with this...

584
00:30:38,360 --> 00:30:40,560
We haven't got much time so let's practice

585
00:30:40,560 --> 00:30:43,100
Yasugibushi is also being broadcast

586
00:30:45,830 --> 00:30:47,740
That's great

587
00:30:49,000 --> 00:30:50,610
So find something

588
00:30:51,240 --> 00:30:53,010
And approach it cautiously

589
00:30:53,010 --> 00:30:54,540
Go towards it

590
00:30:54,540 --> 00:30:56,540
And pick it up

591
00:31:05,190 --> 00:31:06,490
It's great

592
00:31:06,490 --> 00:31:08,820
Hamada-san, you look terrifying

593
00:31:14,060 --> 00:31:16,630
YASU*&*$& IS ALSO BEING BROADCAST...

594
00:31:18,800 --> 00:31:20,470
That's great

595
00:31:20,470 --> 00:31:22,470
Wasn't that shit...?

596
00:31:23,000 --> 00:31:24,270
That was brilliant

597
00:31:32,410 --> 00:31:34,150
It was definitely lame as shit...

598
00:31:38,920 --> 00:31:41,290
Here, he has 2 hours rest

599
00:31:41,290 --> 00:31:46,930
He has 2 hours rest and it passes midnight

600
00:31:46,530 --> 00:31:50,870
He had 2 hours rest and is recovered

601
00:31:49,800 --> 00:31:51,270
It's a new day now...

602
00:31:52,600 --> 00:31:53,800
What is it...?

603
00:31:55,540 --> 00:31:56,000
Kogyaru

604
00:31:58,440 --> 00:32:00,140
Kogyaru...?

605
00:32:02,180 --> 00:32:04,680
This is better than some of the other ones he's written

606
00:32:06,680 --> 00:32:07,980
Ah- man...

607
00:32:13,590 --> 00:32:15,820
I can't be doing this shit...

608
00:32:15,820 --> 00:32:17,990
seriously, I might just say it here

609
00:32:17,990 --> 00:32:21,300
****** is also being broadcast

610
00:32:21,300 --> 00:32:23,400
And then go home straight away...

611
00:32:23,400 --> 00:32:25,700
Maybe dress as a nun...

612
00:32:26,000 --> 00:32:28,500
Yeah, as a nun

613
00:32:33,140 --> 00:32:35,710
Labyrinth is being prepared...

614
00:32:42,280 --> 00:32:46,190
Matsumoto here sends 4 orders at the same time

615
00:32:44,120 --> 00:32:48,720
Matsumoto sends 4 orders

616
00:32:44,120 --> 00:32:48,720
at once

617
00:32:49,390 --> 00:32:52,090
Seriously, why the fuck is he still awake

618
00:32:53,190 --> 00:32:56,000
Bakatono

619
00:32:53,930 --> 00:32:56,200
First up, Bakatono

620
00:32:56,200 --> 00:32:58,630
Im bored, shall we go to a convenience store...?

621
00:33:00,740 --> 00:33:04,170
Hamada says he wants to go to the convenience store

622
00:33:04,170 --> 00:33:06,510
Get the palanquins...

623
00:33:08,110 --> 00:33:10,010
Great work so far

624
00:33:10,010 --> 00:33:12,010
The palanquins, the palanquins I say

625
00:33:14,850 --> 00:33:16,920
What the hell...

626
00:33:24,230 --> 00:33:26,560
I'm going to buy all of them

627
00:33:28,530 --> 00:33:30,530
Could I get a receipt

628
00:33:30,700 --> 00:33:32,570
under NTV...

629
00:33:36,240 --> 00:33:37,740
Let's go back

630
00:33:41,910 --> 00:33:44,080
Ah for fuck's sake, I shouldn't have come

631
00:33:44,980 --> 00:33:46,150
That was a failure

632
00:33:47,780 --> 00:33:50,180
I bought way too much

633
00:33:52,220 --> 00:33:54,690
15 seconds

634
00:33:53,620 --> 00:33:54,690
Ok

635
00:33:55,990 --> 00:33:57,960
I'm not doing it

636
00:33:59,690 --> 00:34:01,100
I said I'm not doing it

637
00:34:01,800 --> 00:34:03,360
I'm not doing it

638
00:34:03,730 --> 00:34:05,200
I SAID I'M NOT DOING IT

639
00:34:05,700 --> 00:34:07,170
HEY YOU FUCKE-...

640
00:34:07,170 --> 00:34:10,470
&*£&£*& is also being broadcast!!

641
00:34:13,110 --> 00:34:14,710
8 minutes until the next one

642
00:34:14,710 --> 00:34:16,610
Okay, please get changed quickly

643
00:34:16,610 --> 00:34:18,610
8 minutes until the next one

644
00:34:20,880 --> 00:34:23,990
Hamada is getting a bit impatient

645
00:34:23,990 --> 00:34:28,120
This is the tough part where he has to keep getting changed quickly

646
00:34:29,360 --> 00:34:30,790
Who the hell am I...?

647
00:34:31,330 --> 00:34:33,390
First up, Suzuki Sonoko

648
00:34:32,460 --> 00:34:36,200
Suzuki Sonoko

649
00:34:33,590 --> 00:34:35,160
5 minutes to go...

650
00:34:36,800 --> 00:34:38,770
Wait, what? After this one, I have 1 minute?

651
00:34:38,770 --> 00:34:39,730
90 seconds...

652
00:34:39,370 --> 00:34:40,740
90 seconds...

653
00:34:40,740 --> 00:34:42,970
Are you serious?!

654
00:34:43,470 --> 00:34:45,010
Damn my face is hot!

655
00:34:46,370 --> 00:34:47,680
10 seconds

656
00:34:56,420 --> 00:34:59,490
Suteritsumorimo is almost... Damn my face is hot!

657
00:35:00,120 --> 00:35:02,160
Okay, 90 seconds!

658
00:35:02,190 --> 00:35:03,490
Next one in a minute

659
00:35:05,760 --> 00:35:11,130
This is a really quick changeover. Suzuki Sonoko turns to Trampman...

660
00:35:09,130 --> 00:35:11,670
Trampman

661
00:35:14,540 --> 00:35:16,070
45 seconds...

662
00:35:17,470 --> 00:35:19,070
That was easy...

663
00:35:23,280 --> 00:35:26,480
Tenshaishingo is also being broadcast...

664
00:35:27,350 --> 00:35:30,620
Okay, 14 minutes until the next one!

665
00:35:29,220 --> 00:35:30,620
14 minutes

666
00:35:34,620 --> 00:35:36,660
I can see through this...

667
00:35:37,790 --> 00:35:42,060
Demon Kogure

668
00:35:38,230 --> 00:35:42,830
And the last one with white paint on his face will be Demon Kogure

669
00:35:45,370 --> 00:35:47,370
This isn't Demon...

670
00:35:46,570 --> 00:35:48,670
Who am I even!?

671
00:35:54,380 --> 00:35:57,210
Labyrinth is being prepared...

672
00:35:59,210 --> 00:36:00,750
Next one in 2 minutes!

673
00:36:00,750 --> 00:36:01,950
Wait, what?

674
00:36:01,950 --> 00:36:02,880
No, 29 minutes

675
00:36:02,880 --> 00:36:05,290
I will smack you man...

676
00:36:05,290 --> 00:36:07,290
29 minutes, you're right, apologies...

677
00:36:07,720 --> 00:36:10,490
The staff who are getting tired make an error...

678
00:36:10,120 --> 00:36:13,930
Shinora-

679
00:36:11,530 --> 00:36:13,860
It's already 2am

680
00:36:13,860 --> 00:36:18,600
Including being dressed as Shinora, only 3 more to go

681
00:36:23,900 --> 00:36:26,970
Yomigaeru Kinrou is also being broadcast

682
00:36:28,340 --> 00:36:30,140
Next one in 2 minutes

683
00:36:30,580 --> 00:36:32,180
What is this...?

684
00:36:31,680 --> 00:36:35,420
Kaminari-san

685
00:36:32,180 --> 00:36:34,420
Next one is Kaminari-san

686
00:36:35,580 --> 00:36:37,790
That was Shinora-...?

687
00:36:38,490 --> 00:36:40,790
Hamada's patience is coming to its end...

688
00:36:44,960 --> 00:36:47,760
I'm wearing tiger striped pants...

689
00:36:49,360 --> 00:36:51,330
You're just mucking around...

690
00:37:01,080 --> 00:37:05,880
Finally, only one more to go

691
00:37:04,550 --> 00:37:07,150
Hamada Masatoshi's 24-hour broadcast...

692
00:37:07,150 --> 00:37:09,680
Finally, only 1 more to go

693
00:37:09,680 --> 00:37:11,690
Right, the last one

694
00:37:11,690 --> 00:37:13,690
What?

695
00:37:14,520 --> 00:37:15,990
Misora Hibari

696
00:37:16,460 --> 00:37:18,130
Misora Hibari...

697
00:37:18,390 --> 00:37:19,860
I see...

698
00:37:20,430 --> 00:37:22,100
This is the last one

699
00:37:26,730 --> 00:37:29,570
The last time he has to do makeup

700
00:37:29,940 --> 00:37:33,010
The staff prepare for the last one too

701
00:37:37,810 --> 00:37:39,550
This is so funny

702
00:37:41,550 --> 00:37:43,520
You look so tired...

703
00:37:51,960 --> 00:37:53,690
You look quite cool though, right at the end

704
00:37:55,730 --> 00:37:59,600
Hamada heads to do the final commercial

705
00:37:57,000 --> 00:37:59,830
24 hours of pain...

706
00:37:59,830 --> 00:38:02,640
He heads to do his final commercial

707
00:38:01,800 --> 00:38:06,070
Final will be 15 seconds

708
00:38:02,640 --> 00:38:05,940
What kind of finale will he show us...

709
00:38:11,050 --> 00:38:13,050
5 seconds...

710
00:38:17,380 --> 00:38:23,190
Sakura fubuki no

711
00:38:24,190 --> 00:38:29,930
Sarai no sora wa

712
00:38:29,930 --> 00:38:32,430
Mabushii Shiho-...

713
00:38:33,870 --> 00:38:37,610
Aoku Susunde

714
00:38:37,610 --> 00:38:39,610
WE'RE ALREADY FUCKING FINISHED!

715
00:38:42,680 --> 00:38:43,910
Great job guys

716
00:38:49,920 --> 00:38:52,120
Great job

717
00:38:52,120 --> 00:38:54,320
Great job

718
00:38:54,320 --> 00:38:56,320
Great job

719
00:38:58,860 --> 00:39:00,960
Great job

720
00:39:11,670 --> 00:39:14,170
They're going to think I'm crying

721
00:39:15,880 --> 00:39:17,480
You know...

722
00:39:17,480 --> 00:39:20,550
We need to change the rules and have a re-match

723
00:39:21,350 --> 00:39:26,990
24 hours, Hamada Masatoshi, let's watch all of them in one go!

724
00:39:26,990 --> 00:39:29,260
NO MAN, WE DON'T NEED TO DO THAT

725
00:41:26,340 --> 00:41:29,710
Damn that was amazing...

726
00:41:38,740 --> 00:41:40,370
WE'RE ALREADY FUCKING FINISHED!

727
00:41:43,880 --> 00:41:45,140
Great work...

728
00:41:46,910 --> 00:41:49,320
Umm, we just saw the Batsu Game

729
00:41:49,320 --> 00:41:52,190
and all but ovewall...

730
00:41:52,190 --> 00:41:53,750
ovewall...?

731
00:41:53,750 --> 00:41:55,760
You were mucking around...

732
00:41:56,160 --> 00:41:58,060
Like too much...

733
00:41:58,060 --> 00:42:00,530
You're taking the piss out of the TV industry so...

734
00:42:00,530 --> 00:42:03,500
let's go apologise to the President...

735
00:42:04,960 --> 00:42:06,470
What...?

736
00:42:05,670 --> 00:42:06,470
Right guys...?

737
00:42:06,470 --> 00:42:08,730
Don't you agree...?

738
00:42:09,300 --> 00:42:11,440
Aren't you going to back me up!?

739
00:42:15,170 --> 00:42:16,380
Oww...

740
00:42:17,440 --> 00:42:19,410
Honestly, I thought he did really well...

741
00:42:20,410 --> 00:42:22,880
Well that's fine, reply then...

742
00:42:22,880 --> 00:42:25,280
Don't just sit there quietly!

743
00:42:25,790 --> 00:42:27,650
But you got to sleep right?

744
00:42:27,650 --> 00:42:30,560
No, I was just lying down and..

745
00:42:30,560 --> 00:42:33,590
We don't know if he really did that over 24 hours you know...?

746
00:42:33,590 --> 00:42:36,000
He cheated?!

747
00:42:34,690 --> 00:42:36,000
Don't be ridiculous

748
00:42:36,000 --> 00:42:38,000
He did

749
00:42:38,460 --> 00:42:40,830
He definitely did, right...?

750
00:42:40,830 --> 00:42:43,240
SAY SOMETHING!

751
00:42:44,840 --> 00:42:46,810
No, I just don't think he cheated...

752
00:42:46,810 --> 00:42:48,810
So what, again...?

753
00:42:48,810 --> 00:42:50,780
We'll battle again

754
00:42:49,640 --> 00:42:50,780
For sure...

755
00:42:50,780 --> 00:42:53,010
I will just say

756
00:42:53,010 --> 00:42:55,010
you want to do golf again?

757
00:42:55,010 --> 00:42:56,320
Wait a second...

758
00:42:56,320 --> 00:42:58,180
The rules are so fucked up

759
00:42:58,180 --> 00:43:00,350
You've always said that, like you're obsessed...

760
00:43:01,390 --> 00:43:03,420
'The rules are so fucked up', 'The rules are so fucked up'...

761
00:43:03,820 --> 00:43:05,020
He does, right?

762
00:43:05,020 --> 00:43:07,490
Since middle school, he's been saying that

763
00:43:06,230 --> 00:43:07,490
Really?

764
00:43:07,490 --> 00:43:09,130
That's a long time!

765
00:43:09,130 --> 00:43:11,400
But... the rules are so fucked up

766
00:43:11,960 --> 00:43:13,370
He just said it again...

767
00:43:14,730 --> 00:43:16,740
But no seriously, the rules are fucked up...

768
00:43:16,740 --> 00:43:18,740
He said it again...

769
00:43:19,410 --> 00:43:21,770
Seriously, how many more times are you going to say that?!

770
00:43:23,240 --> 00:43:25,540
You like baseball, right?

771
00:43:24,740 --> 00:43:25,540
Yes, I do...

772
00:43:25,540 --> 00:43:26,850
Shall we do baseball?

773
00:43:26,850 --> 00:43:27,750
That sounds good

774
00:43:27,750 --> 00:43:29,780
And how exactly are we going to do that...?

775
00:43:29,780 --> 00:43:31,220
Like we have to get him out once, he has to get us out 4 times...

776
00:43:31,220 --> 00:43:32,180
Oh yeah, that sounds great

777
00:43:32,180 --> 00:43:33,850
Wait, what the hell?!

778
00:43:33,850 --> 00:43:34,990
That's great

779
00:43:34,990 --> 00:43:36,420
Are you stupid?!

780
00:43:36,420 --> 00:43:38,420
That's brilliant

781
00:43:37,220 --> 00:43:38,420
I agree

782
00:43:38,420 --> 00:43:40,190
Yeah, those rules sound perfectly reas-

783
00:43:40,190 --> 00:43:42,500
The rules are so fucked up!

784
00:43:45,600 --> 00:43:47,230
That's fair

785
00:43:47,470 --> 00:43:50,340
Stop saying that!

786
00:43:51,140 --> 00:43:53,770
It's like a habit

787
00:43:54,210 --> 00:43:56,240
You just say 'The rules are

788
00:43:56,240 --> 00:43:58,240
so fucked up'

789
00:44:00,410 --> 00:44:02,780
Tennis?

790
00:44:01,950 --> 00:44:02,780
Oh yeah, tennis sounds great

791
00:44:03,480 --> 00:44:05,990
Yeah, with tennis we can do 4 vs 1

792
00:44:05,990 --> 00:44:07,990
Wait, why the hell is it 4 vs 1

793
00:44:07,990 --> 00:44:11,520
That's perfect

794
00:44:08,850 --> 00:44:11,520
Did I ever say anything about being good at tennis?!

795
00:44:11,520 --> 00:44:13,490
But it could be harder for us to be in a foursome...

796
00:44:13,490 --> 00:44:14,690
Yeah

797
00:44:14,690 --> 00:44:16,700
Like we'd get in the way of each other

798
00:44:16,700 --> 00:44:18,960
No no no, I ain't getting tricked

799
00:44:18,960 --> 00:44:22,370
Why the hell not?

800
00:44:20,530 --> 00:44:22,370
Because the rules are so... no, you know what, it doesn't matter...

801
00:44:24,700 --> 00:44:26,590
DON'T YOU FUCKING DARE SAY IT AGAIN

802
00:44:26,590 --> 00:44:28,090
He's quite good at bowling

803
00:44:28,090 --> 00:44:30,690
Yeah, I've heard you're quite good

804
00:44:29,160 --> 00:44:30,690
You are

805
00:44:31,090 --> 00:44:32,790
Shall we do that?

806
00:44:32,790 --> 00:44:35,700
Our balls have 4 holes in it...

807
00:44:35,700 --> 00:44:38,270
Okay

808
00:44:36,200 --> 00:44:38,270
but yours only has one hole

809
00:44:39,470 --> 00:44:40,430
Great...

810
00:44:40,430 --> 00:44:42,740
No, wait...

811
00:44:42,740 --> 00:44:45,910
Be careful, or I will break your finger...

812
00:44:45,910 --> 00:44:47,640
No but don't you think it's fucked up...?

813
00:44:47,640 --> 00:44:49,880
Why do I always have some huge disadvantage...?

814
00:44:49,880 --> 00:44:52,510
If that's the case, you should...

815
00:44:50,540 --> 00:44:52,510
Okay, okay I know

816
00:44:52,510 --> 00:44:55,680
I thought of something brilliant. I will give one person

817
00:44:56,420 --> 00:44:59,690
to you

818
00:44:57,220 --> 00:44:59,690
Okay

819
00:45:01,290 --> 00:45:03,260
2 vs 3...

820
00:45:01,560 --> 00:45:03,260
so 2 vs 3...

821
00:45:11,160 --> 00:45:12,770
Wow wow wow, hold on a minute...

822
00:45:12,130 --> 00:45:12,770
What?

823
00:45:12,770 --> 00:45:14,370
Why him...?

824
00:45:14,370 --> 00:45:16,640
Well I mean, that's probably about what you're going to get...

825
00:45:16,640 --> 00:45:17,940
No man...

826
00:45:17,940 --> 00:45:19,470
It depends on what we do I guess...

827
00:45:19,470 --> 00:45:21,940
He's about to cry...

828
00:45:21,940 --> 00:45:23,380
I don't know then...

829
00:45:23,380 --> 00:45:25,150
You want to do sports though, right?

830
00:45:25,150 --> 00:45:26,810
Well yeah, of course

831
00:45:26,810 --> 00:45:28,620
You used to play football...

832
00:45:28,620 --> 00:45:29,480
Yeah at junior school...

833
00:45:29,480 --> 00:45:31,490
He was quite good

834
00:45:30,320 --> 00:45:31,490
Football?

835
00:45:31,690 --> 00:45:33,820
You're good at ball games, aren't you?

836
00:45:33,820 --> 00:45:35,320
Can we do it though?

837
00:45:35,320 --> 00:45:37,790
You're good at handball, right?

838
00:45:36,360 --> 00:45:37,790
Oh yeah, he's awesome at it

839
00:45:37,790 --> 00:45:40,330
Handball...?

840
00:45:38,930 --> 00:45:40,330
He used to like represent regionals...

841
00:45:40,330 --> 00:45:42,360
For real?!

842
00:45:42,760 --> 00:45:45,870
You do love sports, don't you!

843
00:45:43,400 --> 00:45:45,870
If I went over there, we would win, I'm sure.

844
00:45:46,570 --> 00:45:48,170
Do you want to go over there though?

845
00:45:48,170 --> 00:45:51,070
No, if Hamada-san

846
00:45:51,070 --> 00:45:53,870
chooses me to come over, I would happily...

847
00:45:53,870 --> 00:45:56,540
Then I want to go too...

848
00:45:56,040 --> 00:46:33,480
This video was brought to you by Tofu Panda Fansubs

849
00:45:56,540 --> 00:45:57,640
Then I would like to come too...

850
00:45:57,640 --> 00:45:59,650
Yeah, let's do that then!

851
00:46:01,380 --> 00:46:02,720
Yeah, we're coming to your side

852
00:46:03,720 --> 00:46:05,090
We're going to win...

853
00:46:06,490 --> 00:46:07,890
We are young after all

854
00:46:07,890 --> 00:46:09,360
True

855
00:46:09,360 --> 00:46:11,360
Right then, what are we going to do, eh?

856
00:46:11,930 --> 00:46:13,430
What we playing?

857
00:46:12,630 --> 00:46:13,430
Come on, what?

858
00:46:13,430 --> 00:46:14,860
Tell us!

859
00:46:14,860 --> 00:46:17,100
What we going to play...?

860
00:46:17,100 --> 00:46:19,070
ha-.....

861
00:46:20,630 --> 00:46:22,000
What kind of sigh is that!
