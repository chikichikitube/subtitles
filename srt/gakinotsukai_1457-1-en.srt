Ah again, they're...

00:00:09,490 --> 00:00:10,630
They're rich

7
00:00:10,630 --> 00:00:12,400
They're rich?

8
00:00:11,240 --> 00:00:12,400
Rich?

9
00:00:12,400 --> 00:00:15,230
Consome Double Punch

10
00:00:12,400 --> 00:00:15,230
They could be those plain ones

11
00:00:14,430 --> 00:00:15,740
Could be, could be

12
00:00:16,670 --> 00:00:20,570
I guess I'm lame after all ...

13
00:00:17,760 --> 00:00:20,570

This is a team effort kiki

22
00:00:38,590 --> 00:00:42,590
A really  bad guess gets a punishment!

23
00:00:42,590 --> 00:00:45,930
You just gotta smell it before anyone huh?

24
00:00:42,590 --> 00:01:01,980
Recap

25
00:00:45,930 --> 00:00:49,270
The one we ate, was, Chicken Salt flavour!

26
00:00:47,360 --> 00:00:51,470
Infinitely Delicious Chicken Salt

27
00:00:50,080 --> 00:00:51,470
Unfortunatley, incorrect!

28
00:00:51,470 --> 00:00:53,880
It was 24, Ibburi-Gakki flavour!

29
00:00:53,880 --> 00:00:55,670
Octopus?

30
00:00:54,970 --> 00:00:57,570
It's a pickle

31
00:00:57,180 --> 00:00:59,440
Oh yeah, it's ibburi-gakko!

32
00:00:59,440 --> 00:01:01,980
It literally can't be anything else

ya Arahende!

37
00:01:09,990 --> 00:01:12,140
The appearance is a good hint, huh?

38
00:01:11,400 --> 00:01:12,500
Yeah

39
00:01:12,140 --> 00:01:14,190
Let's move on to the next chips

40
00:01:14,290 --> 00:01:15,960
7th flavour

41
00:01:14,420 --> 00:01:17,060
Continuing on, these are the next chips

42
00:01:17,460 --> 00:01:19,430
They look different

43
00:01:17,980 --> 00:01:20,200
They're hard fried

44
00:01:19,430 --> 00:01:21,430
We can distinguish them

45
00:01:21,430 --> 00:01:23,030
7th f

46
00:01:21,430 --> 00:01:23,030
Hard fried, they're hard fried!

47
00:01:22,600 --> 00:01:24,300
Yes

48
00:01:23,360 --> 00:01:25,420
There's a lot of hard fried...

49
00:01:24,420 --> 00:01:26,720
There's a ton of them!

50
00:01:25,660 --> 00:01:27,220
Could be black pepper?

51
00:01:27,000 --> 00:01:30,040
7th flavour

52
00:01:27,000 --> 00:01:30,040
There's not a hint of pepper you absoulte numpty!

53
00:01:30,410 --> 00:01:32,940
There's no black flecks or anything!

54
00:01:32,240 --> 00:01:34,110
Don't make lame jokes!

55
00:01:37,520 --> 00:01:40,720
What black pepper are you seeing here?

56
00:01:41,280 --> 00:01:43,340
Lost all my confidence suddenly...

57
00:01:45,560 --> 00:01:46,690
Hmm?

58
00:01:46,760 --> 00:01:48,720
The taste ...

59
00:01:48,720 --> 00:01:51,010
It's definitely hard fried

60
00:01:51,010 --> 00:01:52,080
I see

61
00:01:51,520 --> 00:01:53,460
The appearance, right?

62
00:01:52,660 --> 00:01:53,940
It's crunchy

63
00:01:53,460 --> 00:01:55,000
Uwahh, I see

64
00:01:55,000 --> 00:01:56,870
But it's definitely,
Yes?

65
00:01:56,870 --> 00:01:59,300
It's not Seaweed from #28,

66
00:01:56,870 --> 00:02:02,410
Edamame Garlic

67
00:01:56,870 --> 00:02:02,410
Seaweed

68
00:01:56,870 --> 00:02:02,410
Wasabi Salt

69
00:01:59,300 --> 00:02:02,410
and it's not Edamame or Wasabi either

70
00:02:02,410 --> 00:02:05,580
#27 Black Pepper - It's not black pepper either

71
00:02:03,680 --> 00:02:05,340
In that case?

72
00:02:05,580 --> 00:02:06,780
Konbu Soy Sauce

73
00:02:05,580 --> 00:02:11,680
It's for sure between 32 and 35

74
00:02:09,650 --> 00:02:11,680
Kyushu Soy Sauce

75
00:02:11,480 --> 00:02:14,020
So you've narrowed it down to 4

76
00:02:11,680 --> 00:02:21,730
Kansai Dashi Soy

77
00:02:11,680 --> 00:02:21,730
Konbu Soy Sauce

78
00:02:11,680 --> 00:02:21,730
Kyushu Soy Sauce

79
00:02:11,680 --> 00:02:21,730
White Shrimp

80
00:02:13,420 --> 00:02:16,320
I think I am not mistaken here

81
00:02:16,320 --> 00:02:17,860
There is no mistake here

82
00:02:17,860 --> 00:02:19,460
Right?

83
00:02:18,520 --> 00:02:20,900
Tanaka-san, and Housei-san agree?

84
00:02:20,160 --> 00:02:21,730
Yes, no mistake

85
00:02:20,530 --> 00:02:25,130
There's no plum taste from 31 either

86
00:02:21,730 --> 00:02:27,560
Kansai Dashi Soy

87
00:02:21,730 --> 00:02:27,560
Konbu Soy

88
00:02:21,730 --> 00:02:27,560
Kyushu Soy Sauce

89
00:02:21,730 --> 00:02:27,560
Plum and Konbu

90
00:02:21,730 --> 00:02:27,560
White Shrimp

91
00:02:23,760 --> 00:02:26,100
What about this Kyushu Soy Sauce?

92
00:02:25,400 --> 00:02:28,260
Or like Kansai Dashi Soy Sauce

93
00:02:27,560 --> 00:02:32,500
text

94
00:02:27,560 --> 00:02:32,500
text

95
00:02:27,560 --> 00:02:32,500
text

96
00:02:27,640 --> 00:02:29,630
It has a Kansai taste

97
00:02:28,660 --> 00:02:30,460
The smell is pretty-

98
00:02:29,630 --> 00:02:32,500
Right? a Kyushu smell

99
00:02:32,500 --> 00:02:34,240
It's a deep taste

100
00:02:34,240 --> 00:02:35,540
I see

101
00:02:37,300 --> 00:02:38,340
Kansai?

102
00:02:37,510 --> 00:02:45,250
Kansai Dashi Soy Sauce

103
00:02:38,340 --> 00:02:39,680
or Kyushu?

104
00:02:38,340 --> 00:02:45,250
Kyushu Soy Sauce

105
00:02:39,880 --> 00:02:41,960
You're that confident?

106
00:02:41,960 --> 00:02:43,550
You're confident?

107
00:02:42,380 --> 00:02:44,720
It's between those two right?

108
00:02:43,420 --> 00:02:45,380
32 or 34

109
00:02:45,250 --> 00:02:47,750
Kansai Dashi Soy Sauce

110
00:02:45,250 --> 00:02:47,750
Kyushu Soy Sauce

111
00:02:45,720 --> 00:02:47,220
It's either one

112
00:02:46,560 --> 00:02:47,750
Yeah

113
00:02:47,750 --> 00:02:50,950
34 and 35 are both soy sauce,

114
00:02:50,950 --> 00:02:52,890
just the dashi is different

115
00:02:52,890 --> 00:02:55,160
So it depends whether we can taste dashi

116
00:02:55,160 --> 00:02:56,900
I see

117
00:02:55,960 --> 00:02:58,580
The soy sauce is hard to discern

118
00:02:57,780 --> 00:02:59,160
I see, I see

119
00:02:59,160 --> 00:03:00,520
Kansai...

120
00:03:01,030 --> 00:03:03,240
has a more delicate flavour?

121
00:03:03,570 --> 00:03:06,880
Yeah I agree, it's weaker

122
00:03:05,720 --> 00:03:07,820
Then it's Kyushu?

123
00:03:07,320 --> 00:03:09,720
It feels like Kyushu ...

124
00:03:09,010 --> 00:03:13,940
I think the dashi taste is the sweetness

125
00:03:12,160 --> 00:03:13,720
I see

126
00:03:14,560 --> 00:03:16,440
They're really glaring at you!

127
00:03:17,360 --> 00:03:19,660
That was really cold reaction!

128
00:03:19,760 --> 00:03:21,900
They really don't agree

129
00:03:21,180 --> 00:03:22,580
Exactly

130
00:03:22,640 --> 00:03:24,240
I think it's #35 (Kyushu)

131
00:03:24,240 --> 00:03:26,100
I see

132
00:03:24,600 --> 00:03:26,920
Kyushu ...

133
00:03:26,100 --> 00:03:29,680
It doesn't have that kansai dashi taste

134
00:03:30,020 --> 00:03:31,630
I think this is good

135
00:03:31,630 --> 00:03:32,820
You all agree?

136
00:03:32,320 --> 00:03:33,900
Yup

137
00:03:33,400 --> 00:03:35,170
Then everyone,

138
00:03:34,300 --> 00:03:35,440
yes

139
00:03:35,170 --> 00:03:36,970
are you ready?

140
00:03:37,430 --> 00:03:38,880
The answer please!

141
00:03:38,380 --> 00:03:39,340
Ok

142
00:03:39,340 --> 00:03:43,970
The one we all ate, was, Kyushu Soy Sauce flavour!

143
00:03:41,200 --> 00:03:50,680
Hard Fried Potato

144
00:03:41,200 --> 00:03:50,680
Kyushu Soy Sauce Flavour

145
00:03:45,420 --> 00:03:46,980
Correct!

146
00:03:45,480 --> 00:03:50,680
Correct!

147
00:03:47,040 --> 00:03:48,710
YEAHASDHAJSKLD !!!!!!

148
00:03:48,950 --> 00:03:50,680
Well done!

149
00:03:50,240 --> 00:03:51,540
We did it!

150
00:03:51,540 --> 00:03:52,860
That was

151
00:03:52,460 --> 00:03:54,200
That was well done

152
00:03:53,600 --> 00:03:55,750
I'm so happy

153
00:03:55,750 --> 00:03:59,620
You narrowed it down first, between 32 and 35

154
00:03:55,750 --> 00:04:00,660
Limited Time Product (China - Shikoku - Kyushu)

155
00:03:58,900 --> 00:04:00,660
This feels great

156
00:04:00,100 --> 00:04:01,960
That was great

157
00:04:00,820 --> 00:04:08,100
Kyushu Soy Sauce

158
00:04:00,820 --> 00:04:08,100
The rich chicken broth brings out the sweetness in the soy sauce

159
00:04:06,840 --> 00:04:08,450
I feel great

160
00:04:08,100 --> 00:04:10,770
8th flavour

161
00:04:08,130 --> 00:04:11,120
Let's continue to these chips

162
00:04:11,500 --> 00:04:12,520
Oh?

163
00:04:12,520 --> 00:04:14,560
These are the next chips

164
00:04:13,800 --> 00:04:15,500
The appearance is a hint again

165
00:04:15,100 --> 00:04:17,060
Right? The pepper

166
00:04:17,340 --> 00:04:18,840
That's a hint

167
00:04:18,840 --> 00:04:21,080
It's pepper, right?

168
00:04:19,220 --> 00:04:20,600
This is pepper

169
00:04:21,150 --> 00:04:22,760
Definitely pepper

170
00:04:22,160 --> 00:04:23,580
The black flecks?

171
00:04:24,050 --> 00:04:25,620
There are black flecks

172
00:04:31,150 --> 00:04:31,890
It's pepper

173
00:04:33,080 --> 00:04:34,520
It's sweet

174
00:04:35,030 --> 00:04:36,510
Sweet, but peppery

175
00:04:36,160 --> 00:04:37,360
Yeah of course

176
00:04:37,360 --> 00:04:39,180
This is pepper

177
00:04:39,180 --> 00:04:40,760
It's pepper for sure

178
00:04:40,130 --> 00:04:43,900
Should we just go for the pepper?

179
00:04:41,240 --> 00:04:42,460
I think pepper is correct

180
00:04:42,460 --> 00:04:44,250
What pepper ones are there?

181
00:04:43,440 --> 00:04:45,800
There's 27 ...

182
00:04:43,900 --> 00:04:47,970
Hard Fried - Black Pepper

183
00:04:45,800 --> 00:04:47,970
It's not hard fried though

184
00:04:46,580 --> 00:04:47,970
It's not hard fried right

185
00:04:47,970 --> 00:04:49,580
So eliminate that

186
00:04:50,060 --> 00:04:51,520
Pepper, pepper

187
00:04:50,860 --> 00:04:52,640
#57

188
00:04:52,060 --> 00:04:53,410
57?

189
00:04:53,410 --> 00:04:55,320
Toyama Black Ramen?

190
00:04:53,710 --> 00:04:56,550
Toyama's Black Ramen Flavour

191
00:04:54,220 --> 00:04:56,440
Black Ramen?

192
00:04:55,440 --> 00:04:56,680
Oh yeah

193
00:04:56,680 --> 00:04:58,260
That black ramen?

194
00:04:56,710 --> 00:05:03,920
Toyama Black Ramen

195
00:04:56,710 --> 00:05:03,920

We said it's pepper man

That is pepper ramen

198
00:05:02,590 --> 00:05:03,960
It's pepper flavour ramen

199
00:05:03,240 --> 00:05:05,180
There's no other pepper flavours, huh?

200
00:05:04,680 --> 00:05:06,080
Oh yeah

201
00:05:05,580 --> 00:05:09,020

This is the answer

Right?

205
00:05:13,560 --> 00:05:15,960
TN: I think kuro kosho is black pepper (black seasoning)

206
00:05:13,560 --> 00:05:15,960
This is definitely kuro kosho flavour

207
00:05:15,960 --> 00:05:17,460

Yup, yeah

Unfortunately, incorrect!

217
00:05:38,240 --> 00:05:41,260
Eh, it's not this one?

218
00:05:39,080 --> 00:05:41,260
It's not my fault, ok?

219
00:05:41,590 --> 00:05:43,080
Yes that's true but,

220
00:05:43,080 --> 00:05:47,080
Housei-san you should have been more confident

221
00:05:46,020 --> 00:05:47,740
Correct answer?

00:06:02,840 --> 00:06:04,300
You were doubted

234
00:06:03,000 --> 00:06:04,840
Someone doubted me

235
00:06:04,300 --> 00:06:05,250
Who?

236
00:06:05,250 --> 00:06:06,380

A flavour from one of the 47 Prefectures;

243
00:06:18,860 --> 00:06:25,270
A rich black soup with lots of umami flavour, with a kick from black pepper

244
00:06:22,800 --> 00:06:24,500
That's why it was sweet

245
00:06:24,200 --> 00:06:25,840
Exactly

246
00:06:24,760 --> 00:06:27,260

You guys were quick

291
00:07:31,140 --> 00:07:32,880
I got it from the smell

00:07:31,840 --> 00:07:33,280
Oh really?

293
00:07:32,040 --> 00:07:34,870
It's a delicate smell

These types

302
00:07:52,740 --> 00:07:54,820
These are ruffled, right?

303
00:07:54,320 --> 00:07:56,560
Yeah these are ruffled right?

304
00:07:55,760 --> 00:07:57,140
The shape is different though

305
00:07:57,090 --> 00:08:00,800
Ruffled - Rich Chicken Consome

00:07:57,090 --> 00:08:00,800
Ruffled - Salt Flavour

307
00:07:57,140 --> 00:07:59,860
This could be the ruffled salt

308
00:07:59,860 --> 00:08:01,400
Looks like it
Yup

309
00:08:00,800 --> 00:08:08,940

This is super rich

313
00:08:08,940 --> 00:08:11,840
Is it butter?

00:08:09,800 --> 00:08:11,220
Yeah, yeah it is

315
00:08:10,160 --> 00:08:11,700

316
00:08:11,400 --> 00:08:12,980
Can I say it?

317
00:08:12,200 --> 00:08:14,220

318
00:08:12,980 --> 00:08:16,350

00:08:20,130 --> 00:08:21,280
It's buttery

325
00:08:20,780 --> 00:08:22,150
It's definitely butter

326
00:08:22,150 --> 00:08:24,400
Right? And it's says rich in the name

327
00:08:24,760 --> 00:08:27,220
"Rich Potato" right?

328
00:08:27,220 --> 00:08:37,800

Everyone agrees?

332
00:08:29,960 --> 00:08:31,180
Let's go for this one

333
00:08:30,600 --> 00:08:33,860
The richness I'm tasting is from this

334
00:08:31,180 --> 00:08:33,660
You all agree with this one?

335
00:08:34,320 --> 00:08:36,080
Let's say it

336
00:08:34,500 --> 00:08:35,720
You're ready?

337
00:08:35,720 --> 00:08:38,130
This tempo is good?

338
00:08:38,300 --> 00:08:40,200
The answer, please!

339
00:08:40,200 --> 00:08:44,670
The one we ate, was, Rich Butter Soy Sauce flavour

340
00:08:41,940 --> 00:08:49,180
Rich Potato - Rich Butter Soy Sauce

341
00:08:45,860 --> 00:08:46,920

Incorrect!

343
00:08:47,900 --> 00:08:49,340
No way!

344
00:08:51,250 --> 00:08:53,480
Who? Who?

345
00:08:52,680 --> 00:08:55,050
Matsumoto-san is responsible for this tempo

346
00:08:55,050 --> 00:08:56,500
He was pointing at me LOL

347
00:08:55,690 --> 00:08:59,660

00:08:55,690 --> 00:08:59,660

349
00:08:56,500 --> 00:08:58,800
Hold on hold on hold on

350
00:08:57,960 --> 00:08:59,780
Matsumoto is the impostor

351
00:08:58,980 --> 00:09:01,180
He said "it's definitely this one"

352
00:09:00,380 --> 00:09:04,240
If you guys keep it up we'll all stop talking

353
00:09:04,430 --> 00:09:07,400
We won't stop talking
I'm just guessing!

354
00:09:07,400 --> 00:09:09,070
Your brain,

355
00:09:09,400 --> 00:09:10,400
shid - shup

356
00:09:10,470 --> 00:09:14,900
should I dweep fwy it?

357
00:09:13,220 --> 00:09:14,900
What the hell is he saying?

358
00:09:15,980 --> 00:09:18,020
That hurts!

359
00:09:18,680 --> 00:09:20,740
This hurts more than you think

360
00:09:20,040 --> 00:09:22,120
What the hell was he saying?

361
00:09:21,240 --> 00:09:22,580
Our guess is wrong?

362
00:09:22,580 --> 00:09:25,680
It was incorrect

363
00:09:24,160 --> 00:09:25,780
It was definitely butter

364
00:09:25,010 --> 00:09:25,970
Right?

365
00:09:26,380 --> 00:09:36,230
A chip with a unique width and thickness

366
00:09:26,380 --> 00:09:36,230
Kiwa Jaga Series - Potato Butter

367
00:09:36,230 --> 00:09:38,700
A hint for next time,

368
00:09:36,390 --> 00:09:41,500
Kiwa Jaga - Potato Butter

369
00:09:38,700 --> 00:09:41,500
The quantity is less right? So probably,

370
00:09:41,660 --> 00:09:43,800
The chip bag design is different too

371
00:09:42,760 --> 00:09:43,960
Ah oh yeah it is

372
00:09:43,960 --> 00:09:45,070
I see
Right?

373
00:09:45,070 --> 00:09:48,440
It has that, it's a premium type

374
00:09:45,980 --> 00:09:47,560
Yeah, yeah

375
00:09:47,560 --> 00:09:49,140
Oh I see

376
00:09:48,440 --> 00:09:50,780
So when it's like this, it's a premium type

377
00:09:49,980 --> 00:09:51,420
That makes sense

378
00:09:50,780 --> 00:09:52,340
Like some fancy cheese

379
00:09:51,940 --> 00:09:54,220
That's how rich it tastes?

380
00:09:54,810 --> 00:10:00,550
From now on,
it is no longer a group effort

381
00:10:00,550 --> 00:10:02,860
Let's start off with Tanaka-san

382
00:10:01,220 --> 00:10:05,250

00:10:05,980 --> 00:10:07,720
Woah you're lucky

388
00:10:06,380 --> 00:10:08,890
This is a lucky question right?

389
00:10:08,380 --> 00:10:09,930
Hold on ...

390
00:10:09,230 --> 00:10:11,200
This is a good one, you're lucky

391
00:10:10,340 --> 00:10:12,300
This is a lucky question

392
00:10:11,200 --> 00:10:13,600
The colour is definitely that one ...

393
00:10:13,330 --> 00:10:23,510
11th flavour

394
00:10:13,600 --> 00:10:15,790
You can definitely narrow it down

395
00:10:14,340 --> 00:10:16,440
This is a good one

396
00:10:16,440 --> 00:10:18,160
It's that one right?
Yeah that one

397
00:10:18,450 --> 00:10:20,370
That's the one that comes to mind

398
00:10:20,370 --> 00:10:21,970
It's definitely that one

399
00:10:22,240 --> 00:10:25,580
You guys can guess without eating?

400
00:10:23,860 --> 00:10:25,580
Yeah, it's definitely that one

401
00:10:26,180 --> 00:10:28,000
It's that one for sure!

402
00:10:27,480 --> 00:10:29,330
Yeah for sure

403
00:10:28,000 --> 00:10:30,580
You're so lucky man

404
00:10:30,580 --> 00:10:33,550
I thought you were gonna guess it right away
Really?

405
00:10:33,820 --> 00:10:35,720
Only Tanaka-san doesn't-

406
00:10:35,120 --> 00:10:37,720
No, no, I got it, I got it

407
00:10:36,660 --> 00:10:38,420
The smell is good right?

408
00:10:38,420 --> 00:10:40,520
Go ahead, Tanaka-san

409
00:10:39,440 --> 00:10:40,520
Go ahead

410
00:10:40,520 --> 00:10:42,190
Please hold on a second

411
00:10:41,990 --> 00:10:44,690
Eh really? I can already say it
You need some time?

412
00:10:44,690 --> 00:10:46,860
Really?
Even though you didn't eat it?

413
00:10:47,300 --> 00:10:48,940
You got it? Really?

414
00:10:48,140 --> 00:10:49,780
Well yeah

415
00:10:48,940 --> 00:10:50,580
I got it

416
00:10:49,780 --> 00:10:51,880
From the smell alone it's gotta be that one

417
00:10:51,200 --> 00:10:53,700
You guys are really confident

418
00:10:51,880 --> 00:10:53,700
It's that one - It's that one

419
00:10:53,700 --> 00:10:55,340
Should I take over?

420
00:10:54,140 --> 00:10:56,670
Endo just take over

421
00:10:55,340 --> 00:10:58,040
Ehhhh I have to take over from you?

422
00:10:57,640 --> 00:10:59,460
You're gonna take over?

423
00:10:58,360 --> 00:11:01,280
I guess I have to

424
00:10:59,460 --> 00:11:03,050
Although you'll be out right away

425
00:11:01,280 --> 00:11:02,580
If I'm incorrect?

426
00:11:02,080 --> 00:11:03,800
Yeah of course

427
00:11:03,100 --> 00:11:05,280
Yeah of course you will

428
00:11:05,280 --> 00:11:09,290
Then which one of us should take over? I already got it

429
00:11:08,400 --> 00:11:10,820
You want to take over?

430
00:11:09,040 --> 00:11:11,240
I want to take over

431
00:11:09,040 --> 00:11:11,240
I want to take over

432
00:11:10,820 --> 00:11:14,780
Tanaka-san's reputation is in the gutter now huh?

433
00:11:13,720 --> 00:11:16,020
Should we do rock paper scissors?

434
00:11:15,000 --> 00:11:16,420
What shall we do?

435
00:11:16,160 --> 00:11:17,990
We can eat it right?

436
00:11:16,890 --> 00:11:19,750
Of course, this is about taking Tanaka's turn

437
00:11:19,090 --> 00:11:21,130
Whoever wins tells him

438
00:11:26,400 --> 00:11:29,280
Wow so lucky
Itadakimasu

439
00:11:29,280 --> 00:11:32,680
You're taking over before the batsu game?

440
00:11:32,780 --> 00:11:34,680
It's a batsu game right away

441
00:11:36,960 --> 00:11:39,140
I have no goddamn idea ...

442
00:11:39,380 --> 00:11:41,120
What the hell man

443
00:11:41,420 --> 00:11:44,950
The taste is totally different?!

444
00:11:41,480 --> 00:11:44,950
Right? It's harder than you think

445
00:11:42,380 --> 00:11:44,950
Seiously?

446
00:11:45,660 --> 00:11:48,860
Potato Chips 72 Flavour Guessing Game

447
00:11:49,000 --> 00:11:52,600
Matsumoto takes over Tanaka's challenge!

448
00:11:49,390 --> 00:11:52,860
Challenger switched

449
00:11:52,860 --> 00:12:13,620
Challenger Switched

450
00:11:53,300 --> 00:11:55,360
It's a batsu-game right away

451
00:11:57,630 --> 00:11:59,540
I have no goddamn idea

452
00:12:00,370 --> 00:12:01,470
What the hell man

453
00:12:02,640 --> 00:12:05,140
It's difficult right?

454
00:12:03,240 --> 00:12:04,960
Seriously?

455
00:12:05,310 --> 00:12:06,940
What should I do now?

456
00:12:06,440 --> 00:12:09,010
You already took his turn

457
00:12:09,010 --> 00:12:10,950
You have to guess it

458
00:12:10,780 --> 00:12:12,510
You wanted to take his turn

459
00:12:11,440 --> 00:12:13,040
This....

460
00:12:12,150 --> 00:12:13,620
It's your fault

461
00:12:13,620 --> 00:12:16,820
I thought it was #61

462
00:12:14,850 --> 00:12:16,820
Shizuoka - Sakura Shrimp

463
00:12:16,820 --> 00:12:19,620
But after I ate it, it was totally different

464
00:12:16,820 --> 00:12:19,620
Challenger Switched

465
00:12:19,620 --> 00:12:24,630
There's this redness in the chips,

466
00:12:24,790 --> 00:12:26,860
So it could be #64

467
00:12:26,860 --> 00:12:28,770
Beni Shoga?

468
00:12:26,860 --> 00:12:29,100
Osaka - Pickled Ginger (Beni Shoga)

469
00:12:26,860 --> 00:12:29,100
Shiga - Beef Steak

470
00:12:28,770 --> 00:12:31,220
This is REALLY hard
It's difficult yes

471
00:12:31,220 --> 00:12:32,700
I got it
This is a hard one

472
00:12:32,700 --> 00:12:34,840
Then Matsumoto-san, the answer please

473
00:12:34,940 --> 00:12:39,810
The one I ate, was, Osaka Pickled Ginger flavour

474
00:12:36,410 --> 00:12:42,110
Osaka Beni Shoga

475
00:12:40,780 --> 00:12:43,160

476
00:12:42,150 --> 00:12:46,480
Batsu Game!

477
00:12:42,150 --> 00:12:46,480
Matsumoto

478
00:12:43,720 --> 00:12:45,120
You wanted to take over

479
00:12:44,760 --> 00:12:47,720
You took his batsu game

480
00:12:50,550 --> 00:12:51,990
Ta-to, Ta-to

481
00:12:51,990 --> 00:12:53,990
It's Po-ta-to!

482
00:12:53,990 --> 00:12:56,330
What the hell are you making me say?!

483
00:12:56,680 --> 00:12:59,060
What the hell was he saying?

484
00:12:59,060 --> 00:13:02,500
Ehhhhh? I have no idea
Tanaka-san what did you think it was?

485
00:13:02,500 --> 00:13:04,300
Shizuoka - Sakura Shrimp

486
00:13:02,500 --> 00:13:04,660
I thought it was #61

487
00:13:03,680 --> 00:13:08,600
That's what you thought, and the correct answer is exactly that

488
00:13:08,600 --> 00:13:09,970
It was sakura shrimp

489
00:13:09,970 --> 00:13:13,420
Give me my turn back!
That's messed up!

490
00:13:10,140 --> 00:13:15,810

491
00:13:10,140 --> 00:13:15,810

00:13:15,980 --> 00:13:25,790
A flavour from one of the 47 prefectures

494
00:13:15,980 --> 00:13:25,790
Enjoy the delicious taste of shrimp from Suruga Bay

495
00:13:16,540 --> 00:13:20,480

496
00:13:25,990 --> 00:13:28,790

498
00:13:26,040 --> 00:13:29,090
Endo-san gets these chips

499
00:13:29,090 --> 00:13:32,400


500
00:13:32,830 --> 00:13:35,400
These should be immediately guessed
Go ahead man

501
00:13:36,000 --> 00:13:38,600
Don't take up too much time

502
00:13:36,300 --> 00:13:44,010
12th flavour

503
00:13:37,600 --> 00:13:40,100
It's up to him LOL

504
00:13:40,670 --> 00:13:42,740
OK, I'm ready

505
00:13:41,300 --> 00:13:42,740
Already?

506
00:13:41,300 --> 00:13:42,740
That was fast!

507
00:13:42,740 --> 00:13:44,010
#25

508
00:13:44,460 --> 00:13:46,500
This is-
You're ready?

509
00:13:44,460 --> 00:13:48,180

00:13:46,500 --> 00:13:48,640
Thick Cut Wasabi
That was fast

511
00:13:48,640 --> 00:13:50,440
You're good with that?

512
00:13:48,640 --> 00:13:52,150
He's so goddamn handsome

513
00:13:52,150 --> 00:13:54,350

514
00:13:54,350 --> 00:13:57,050

Wasabi

517
00:13:58,350 --> 00:14:01,320
CORRECT!

518
00:13:58,460 --> 00:13:59,720
Correct!!!!!

519
00:13:59,720 --> 00:14:01,670
Marvelous!

520
00:13:59,720 --> 00:14:01,670
So fast!

521
00:14:02,660 --> 00:14:04,560
As soon as you ate it

522
00:14:03,700 --> 00:14:05,520
Yes exactly

523
00:14:05,830 --> 00:14:07,220
That was cool

524
00:14:06,000 --> 00:14:13,400
* Limited Regions (China, Shikoku, Kyushu)

525
00:14:06,000 --> 00:14:13,400
Wasabi

526
00:14:06,720 --> 00:14:07,940
Thank you very much

527
00:14:07,220 --> 00:14:09,100
That speed...

528
00:14:09,100 --> 00:14:13,100
This was an easy one to guess

529
00:14:13,400 --> 00:14:16,610
Hamada-san's challenge are these chips

530
00:14:13,540 --> 00:14:17,070
Gorilla

531
00:14:13,540 --> 00:14:17,070
Single Challenger

532
00:14:16,840 --> 00:14:18,940
Hamada-san gets these chips

533
00:14:18,440 --> 00:14:20,500
Ah, these could be those ones

534
00:14:19,940 --> 00:14:21,480
Right? I've seen these before

535
00:14:20,040 --> 00:15:01,520
13th flavour

536
00:14:20,500 --> 00:14:22,350
They're those kinds

537
00:14:24,150 --> 00:14:26,400
That type for sure

538
00:14:36,430 --> 00:14:39,410
We can totally take over for you

539
00:14:42,060 --> 00:14:46,400
There's nothing special here at all ...

540
00:14:44,400 --> 00:14:47,200
That can't be true

541
00:14:47,400 --> 00:14:49,170
There's some clue for sure

542
00:14:49,170 --> 00:14:52,580
Ehhh what flavour is this?

543
00:14:53,340 --> 00:14:56,480
This is also a straight away batsu game

544
00:14:55,620 --> 00:14:57,440
Eh what?

545
00:14:56,480 --> 00:14:58,650
Out right away

546
00:14:58,650 --> 00:15:01,520
If your guess is really bad

547
00:14:59,880 --> 00:15:01,520
Ah I see

548
00:15:01,980 --> 00:15:05,250
If you are way off from the right answer

549
00:15:05,250 --> 00:15:09,090
Yes exactly

550
00:15:09,090 --> 00:15:10,960
He's eating the shit out of them

551
00:15:11,890 --> 00:15:14,660
Hard to believe this guy just took a shit

552
00:15:14,800 --> 00:15:17,700
He took a long time shitting, huh?

553
00:15:15,360 --> 00:15:21,670
Took a 10 minute bathroom break

554
00:15:17,700 --> 00:15:21,670
Isn't this the standard lightly salted?

555
00:15:22,940 --> 00:15:26,210
Lightly Salted

556
00:15:23,100 --> 00:15:25,080
At this point
At this point

557
00:15:25,080 --> 00:15:27,680
Then are you ready?

558
00:15:26,140 --> 00:15:27,680
Yes, yes

559
00:15:27,680 --> 00:15:30,650
Then Hamada-san, the answer please!

560
00:15:28,940 --> 00:15:30,650
The one I ate, was,

561
00:15:30,650 --> 00:15:32,420
lightly salted flavour

562
00:15:34,020 --> 00:15:35,550
Unfortunately,

563
00:15:35,690 --> 00:15:37,120
incorrect!

564
00:15:36,490 --> 00:15:39,990
Batsu Game

565
00:15:36,490 --> 00:15:39,990
Hamada

566
00:15:38,060 --> 00:15:40,560
Straight away

567
00:15:40,660 --> 00:15:45,090
Hamada-san your guess was way off

568
00:15:44,620 --> 00:15:45,790
way off?

569
00:15:45,390 --> 00:15:47,020
But that ...

570
00:15:46,700 --> 00:15:48,400
Your taste buds are useless

571
00:15:48,400 --> 00:15:50,800
You bloody Potato Baron

572
00:15:53,940 --> 00:15:56,710
That was an amazing sound
Why the hell was he angry?

573
00:15:56,940 --> 00:15:58,860
What was that

574
00:15:57,600 --> 00:16:00,400
You thought it was lightly salted,

575
00:16:00,400 --> 00:16:04,640
it was this Yokohama Tonkatsu Soy Sauce Ramen flavour

576
00:16:03,240 --> 00:16:06,200
I have no goddamn idea

577
00:16:04,640 --> 00:16:05,880
No idea

578
00:16:05,880 --> 00:16:07,980
This was difficult?

579
00:16:08,150 --> 00:16:16,990
Experience the plenitful flavour of Yokohama Tonkatsu Ramen

580
00:16:08,150 --> 00:16:16,990
A flavour from one of the 47 prefectures;
A Kanagawa flavour

581
00:16:16,990 --> 00:16:19,730
Matsumoto's challenge is these chips

582
00:16:17,190 --> 00:16:20,500
Matsumoto

583
00:16:17,190 --> 00:16:20,500
Single Challenger

584
00:16:20,720 --> 00:16:24,200
They look really basic

585
00:16:23,200 --> 00:16:25,100
The appearance yeah

586
00:16:25,370 --> 00:16:28,100
Certainly
Woah amazing

587
00:16:28,100 --> 00:16:30,740
You definitely modified them huh?

588
00:16:30,740 --> 00:16:33,080
We didn't, we really didn't

589
00:16:33,080 --> 00:16:36,100
The staff here, I have no trust for them

590
00:16:33,640 --> 00:17:14,120
14th flavour

591
00:16:36,100 --> 00:16:39,650
They want me to fail

592
00:16:39,720 --> 00:16:43,300
We really didn't modify them, you can even see here afterwards

593
00:16:43,300 --> 00:16:44,920
Oh really?

594
00:16:44,100 --> 00:16:46,540
We did not modify anything

595
00:16:46,540 --> 00:16:47,990
Really?

596
00:16:47,990 --> 00:16:49,190
Then,

597
00:16:49,760 --> 00:16:53,760
I sincerely apologise for my conduct

598
00:16:51,760 --> 00:16:52,800
So honest!

599
00:16:52,800 --> 00:16:54,640
What a supremely decent person!

600
00:16:54,640 --> 00:16:56,520
What a great person!

601
00:16:57,220 --> 00:16:58,880
What flavour could they be...

602
00:17:01,040 --> 00:17:02,440
Uwahhh

603
00:17:05,040 --> 00:17:06,610
UwaHH

604
00:17:11,610 --> 00:17:13,250
It's that one!

605
00:17:14,040 --> 00:17:15,580
He got it?

606
00:17:15,580 --> 00:17:18,640
So that "uwahh" didn't mean you were lost

607
00:17:18,640 --> 00:17:20,000
Yeah exactly

608
00:17:19,100 --> 00:17:21,680
He knows which one

609
00:17:20,000 --> 00:17:21,680
You narrowed it down?

610
00:17:21,820 --> 00:17:24,390
It's, honestly,

611
00:17:25,400 --> 00:17:26,230
how do I say

612
00:17:26,230 --> 00:17:29,030
The debut of potato chips

613
00:17:29,580 --> 00:17:31,420
That's how you feel?

614
00:17:31,420 --> 00:17:33,520
Ah, thank you for this!

615
00:17:33,840 --> 00:17:35,340
It's either Lightly Salted,

616
00:17:33,840 --> 00:17:35,600
Lightly Salted

617
00:17:35,340 --> 00:17:37,940
Or #10, White Soy Sauce

618
00:17:35,600 --> 00:17:37,940
White Soy Sauce

619
00:17:37,940 --> 00:17:40,710
Actually there's no soy sauce flavour, I GOT IT!

620
00:17:40,710 --> 00:17:42,380
Are you ready?
Ok, yes!

621
00:17:42,380 --> 00:17:44,200
The answer, please!

622
00:17:43,600 --> 00:17:46,140
The one I ate was Lightly Salted flavour!

623
00:17:44,580 --> 00:17:55,120
Lightly Salted

624
00:17:46,350 --> 00:17:47,900
He's gonna get this one

625
00:17:48,850 --> 00:17:55,120
Correct!

626
00:17:51,520 --> 00:17:54,140
That was amazing, well done!

627
00:17:54,140 --> 00:17:56,870
That was really cool!

628
00:17:56,870 --> 00:17:59,500
That was amazing
That was great!

629
00:17:59,630 --> 00:18:10,470
Lightly Salted

630
00:17:59,630 --> 00:18:10,470
Potato Chips

631
00:17:59,630 --> 00:18:10,470
The king of flavours, introduced in 1975.

632
00:17:59,930 --> 00:18:02,100
Well done Matsumoto!

633
00:18:05,400 --> 00:18:10,170
Popular for over 40 years!

634
00:18:10,470 --> 00:18:11,940
Well done!

635
00:18:10,640 --> 00:18:35,830
Lightly Salted

636
00:18:12,350 --> 00:18:14,100
You really got it

637
00:18:13,120 --> 00:18:15,320
Hamda-san this is lightly salted

638
00:18:14,820 --> 00:18:17,160
Yeah it's the "debut of potato chips"

639
00:18:16,460 --> 00:18:18,850
Yeah you're right

640
00:18:19,040 --> 00:18:26,940
Even though you said the staff wants you to fail, they gave you the lightly salted!

641
00:18:27,020 --> 00:18:29,590
I offer my sincerest apologies

642
00:18:29,590 --> 00:18:31,490
He's really apologising

643
00:18:30,580 --> 00:18:33,240
I will never drink alcohol again

644
00:18:30,580 --> 00:18:33,240
TN: He's making fun of press conferences where celebrities apologise for getting caught drunk driving

645
00:18:32,540 --> 00:18:34,800
You can still drink alcohol

646
00:18:35,850 --> 00:18:38,480
Feels like it's gonna get harder now

647
00:18:36,030 --> 00:18:41,170
Hosei

648
00:18:36,030 --> 00:18:41,170
Single Challenger

649
00:18:39,100 --> 00:18:41,600
Hosei-san's challenge is these chips

650
00:18:42,620 --> 00:18:44,680
Ah they're hard fried

651
00:18:44,180 --> 00:18:47,680
Oh yeah they are

652
00:18:45,120 --> 00:18:47,120
That's lucky

653
00:18:48,510 --> 00:18:50,470
You got good ones

654
00:18:51,080 --> 00:18:59,920
15th flavour

655
00:18:56,290 --> 00:18:58,200
I got it

656
00:18:57,380 --> 00:18:59,800
I want a good tempo going

657
00:19:00,080 --> 00:19:04,160
They look thick, like that Edwin tag

658
00:19:04,160 --> 00:19:05,760
The thickness right?

659
00:19:05,390 --> 00:19:24,310
15th flavour

660
00:19:05,760 --> 00:19:08,860
That Edwin thing right?

661
00:19:06,940 --> 00:19:09,440
That thing yeah

662
00:19:10,130 --> 00:19:13,670
What a cool expression!

663
00:19:11,280 --> 00:19:15,340
Yama-Chan is taking his time huh

664
00:19:15,440 --> 00:19:18,790
It wasn't a freebie question at all

665
00:19:20,600 --> 00:19:22,440
Taking his time

666
00:19:20,940 --> 00:19:23,140
Yeah
I wanna eat them

667
00:19:23,420 --> 00:19:29,190
I'm not sure exactly, but definitely a garlic taste

668
00:19:29,200 --> 00:19:32,870
You're lucky to get one with that distinguishing taste

669
00:19:31,820 --> 00:19:34,520
Right? Thank you very much!

670
00:19:34,720 --> 00:19:38,830
The one I ate, was, Edamame Garlic flavour

671
00:19:36,330 --> 00:19:43,500
Edamame Garlic

672
00:19:36,330 --> 00:19:43,500
Hard Fried

673
00:19:38,230 --> 00:19:39,340
Which one is that?

674
00:19:39,340 --> 00:19:41,020
#29?

675
00:19:41,360 --> 00:19:43,500
CORRECT!!

676
00:19:41,730 --> 00:19:43,830
Correct!

677
00:19:44,240 --> 00:19:47,020
Well done!

678
00:19:44,820 --> 00:19:48,480
That was a lucky one! Mine tasted like lightly salted

679
00:19:48,680 --> 00:19:50,260
So annoying

680
00:19:49,420 --> 00:19:51,020
He's really feeling it!

681
00:19:51,020 --> 00:19:53,480


682
00:19:53,680 --> 00:20:05,920
Edamame Garlic

683
00:19:53,680 --> 00:20:05,920

684
00:19:54,520 --> 00:19:56,940
He's tap dancing!

685
00:19:56,500 --> 00:19:58,300
He's tap dancing

686
00:19:59,800 --> 00:20:01,580
Ah, it really is that one!

687
00:20:01,980 --> 00:20:04,250
Tastes just like the real thing

688
00:20:03,380 --> 00:20:05,920
Hamada-san you think so?

689
00:20:04,460 --> 00:20:07,160
Just like the real thing, can really taste the Edamame

690
00:20:06,090 --> 00:20:15,300
Combining the sweet flavour of Edamame and umami of garlic

691
00:20:06,090 --> 00:20:15,300
Hard Fried - Edamame Garlic

692
00:20:07,160 --> 00:20:08,610
Yes

693
00:20:09,160 --> 00:20:11,060
That was fast

694
00:20:09,980 --> 00:20:12,340
The garlic is the biggest hint

695
00:20:12,340 --> 00:20:15,300
That was easy to guess
Tasty

696
00:20:15,530 --> 00:20:21,300
Now they sample the flavours they are curious about

697
00:20:21,300 --> 00:20:22,920

They're just like normal sweet biscuits

702
00:20:27,580 --> 00:20:31,410
A classic biscuit from Kochi Prefecture

703
00:20:27,580 --> 00:20:31,410

00:20:47,230 --> 00:20:51,400
Like Champagne!

716
00:20:49,140 --> 00:20:50,320
Champagne?

717
00:20:49,820 --> 00:20:51,340

There's no helping it

834
00:23:33,200 --> 00:23:34,910
You thought it was-

835
00:23:33,740 --> 00:23:36,960
I said it doesn't taste like anko!

836
00:23:36,500 --> 00:23:39,520

840
00:23:47,080 --> 00:23:49,040
