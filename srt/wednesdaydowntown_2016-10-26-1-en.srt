1
00:00:00,020 --> 00:00:05,420
No matter how obvious the prank is, a comedian will play along

2
00:00:05,780 --> 00:00:09,500
The target is Viking's Kotouge

3
00:00:09,780 --> 00:00:15,100
How far will he play along with this bad prank?

4
00:00:16,020 --> 00:00:17,460
The first hint is

5
00:00:17,460 --> 00:00:22,620
A suspicious cable coming from the room

6
00:00:28,020 --> 00:00:35,300
He appears to notice something, but still enters the room

7
00:00:34,500 --> 00:00:36,020
You didn't notice this?

8
00:00:35,420 --> 00:00:37,020
No I didn't

9
00:00:35,540 --> 00:00:38,620
When he enters the room, inside are

10
00:00:38,620 --> 00:00:44,260
Some unnatural magic mirrors & plants

11
00:00:42,020 --> 00:00:43,980
Very suspicious

12
00:00:48,020 --> 00:00:50,460
It's already kinda scary

13
00:00:50,460 --> 00:00:53,020
Everyone disappears

14
00:00:51,460 --> 00:00:54,020
Yeah they leave you alone

15
00:00:53,740 --> 00:00:59,940
He doesn't look at towards the magic mirrors

16
00:00:56,740 --> 00:00:59,940
And shows no reaction

17
00:00:58,780 --> 00:01:01,020
You must've noticed
something around now

18
00:01:03,300 --> 00:01:04,780
Please excuse us

19
00:01:04,980 --> 00:01:14,580
Suddenly, police enter the room

20
00:01:06,020 --> 00:01:08,540
Sometime yesterday morning

21
00:01:08,540 --> 00:01:12,340
This lady's wallet

22
00:01:12,340 --> 00:01:14,580
Was lost somewhere on this floor

23
00:01:15,460 --> 00:01:17,460
We're searching around each floor

24
00:01:17,660 --> 00:01:21,660
We'd like to search this area, we appreciate your cooperation

25
00:01:21,780 --> 00:01:23,300
Sure

26
00:01:22,300 --> 00:01:23,300
Thank you

27
00:01:23,620 --> 00:01:30,980
Inside TBS, a woman's wallet was stolen

28
00:01:26,860 --> 00:01:30,980
and fake police begin to search the room

29
00:01:30,140 --> 00:01:33,020
These guys are really fishy

30
00:01:35,020 --> 00:01:38,500
Lastly, we'd also like to check your bag

31
00:01:38,780 --> 00:01:40,940
Alright, please excuse me

32
00:01:39,460 --> 00:01:41,980
It's definitely in there

33
00:01:43,740 --> 00:01:46,700
Uh... Huh?

34
00:01:44,820 --> 00:01:46,700
What color wallet did you say it was?

35
00:01:47,020 --> 00:01:49,100
It was a glossy red one

36
00:01:50,980 --> 00:01:51,660
Huh...

37
00:01:51,660 --> 00:02:01,060
Inside Kotouge's bag is the victim's wallet

38
00:01:52,060 --> 00:01:53,020
Hey that's mine

39
00:01:54,140 --> 00:01:56,980
This is it, isn't it?

40
00:01:56,980 --> 00:01:59,780
N-no, I don't anything about this

41
00:02:00,020 --> 00:02:01,500
That's right, actually-

42
00:02:01,500 --> 00:02:06,580
When Kotouge was taken out of the room

43
00:02:06,580 --> 00:02:10,660
Staff placed the wallet into his bag

44
00:02:11,380 --> 00:02:14,580
There's no mistake right?

45
00:02:12,180 --> 00:02:14,580
Yes

46
00:02:16,020 --> 00:02:17,860
This guy's the thief isn't he?

47
00:02:17,860 --> 00:02:20,100
No no no, uh... this is a mistake

48
00:02:20,980 --> 00:02:26,660
Kotouge suddenly realizes what's going on

49
00:02:22,460 --> 00:02:26,660
And starts playing along with the prank setup

50
00:02:26,660 --> 00:02:31,740
We'd like to collect the evidence

51
00:02:32,020 --> 00:02:35,820
Well it was found inside the bag

52
00:02:35,820 --> 00:02:37,780
No no, I didn't take it

53
00:02:37,780 --> 00:02:41,900
No I didn't take it, I didn't take it

54
00:02:38,780 --> 00:02:41,900
Well it didn't walk in there on its own

55
00:02:42,020 --> 00:02:44,940
Well, we can take our time listening to your story

56
00:02:45,300 --> 00:02:47,380
It's 14:45

57
00:02:47,380 --> 00:02:48,900
Get up

58
00:02:48,900 --> 00:02:52,820
No, I didn't do it

59
00:02:50,420 --> 00:02:52,820
,14:45 the suspect is arrested

60
00:02:53,020 --> 00:02:59,740
,Arrested under suspicion of theft

61
00:02:57,460 --> 00:02:59,740
,No no I didn't do it

62
00:03:01,020 --> 00:03:06,900
,When told to get up, he stands

63
00:03:03,460 --> 00:03:06,900
,When told he's under arrest, he extends his arms

64
00:03:06,900 --> 00:03:11,380
,To both the police and the prank, Kotouge is very compliant

65
00:03:11,580 --> 00:03:20,940
The press are already here

66
00:03:21,820 --> 00:03:25,100
You're laughing!

67
00:03:23,020 --> 00:03:25,100
Of course I would laugh here

68
00:03:25,260 --> 00:03:28,020
No no, I didn't take it

69
00:03:30,860 --> 00:03:32,700
Is this for real

70
00:03:33,020 --> 00:03:38,500
In reaction to the unbelievable event, Kotouge unintentionally laughs

71
00:03:39,620 --> 00:03:45,660
While thinking "This is a prank right?" he says

72
00:03:46,180 --> 00:03:48,260
There's no way I'd do something like that

73
00:03:48,460 --> 00:03:51,580
He once again plays along

74
00:03:51,900 --> 00:03:56,740
But with his "There's no way" laugh

75
00:03:56,740 --> 00:04:00,580
His playing along isn't very convincing

76
00:04:00,980 --> 00:04:06,940
If you play along, then play along seriously

77
00:04:02,260 --> 00:04:06,940
If you Tsukkomi, then Tsukkomi seriously

78
00:04:05,020 --> 00:04:06,940
We wanted a clear answer but

79
00:04:07,220 --> 00:04:10,340
Do you always perform your crimes in the dressing rooms?

80
00:04:10,340 --> 00:04:12,700
No no I didn't do it, there's no always

81
00:04:12,980 --> 00:04:14,900
How many times have you done this?

82
00:04:15,700 --> 00:04:18,180
No this is my first time

83
00:04:18,180 --> 00:04:20,580
"First time" I mean I didn't do it though

84
00:04:20,940 --> 00:04:22,740
You just confessed right?

85
00:04:22,740 --> 00:04:24,620
No that's not what I meant...

86
00:04:25,900 --> 00:04:27,860
Where are we going?

87
00:04:28,140 --> 00:04:29,820
Court

88
00:04:30,020 --> 00:04:33,980
Instead of the police station, it's court

89
00:04:32,060 --> 00:04:33,980
Court?

90
00:04:35,020 --> 00:04:42,820
And so they take Kotouge to a house studio with a court themed set

91
00:04:43,060 --> 00:04:49,780
They skip the interrogation and go straight to trial

92
00:04:50,860 --> 00:04:55,980
Defendant Kotouge's theft trial begins

93
00:04:56,660 --> 00:04:58,700
Defendant, take the stand

94
00:05:04,020 --> 00:05:07,380
Prosecution, your opening statement

95
00:05:07,780 --> 00:05:09,860
The prosecution states that

96
00:05:10,260 --> 00:05:16,460
In Minato Ward, Akasaka 5-3-6, TBS HQ's 7th Floor Meeting Room

97
00:05:16,460 --> 00:05:19,660
A wallet containing Â¥15,000 belonging to a Iroha Fumiko was stolen

98
00:05:19,660 --> 00:05:20,500
by the defendant

99
00:05:20,860 --> 00:05:24,340
Criminal Theft under Penal Code Article 235

100
00:05:24,340 --> 00:05:25,580
That is all

101
00:05:25,860 --> 00:05:27,940
Defendant, do you dispute these claims?

102
00:05:28,980 --> 00:05:31,540
Well I mean I didn't take it

103
00:05:31,780 --> 00:05:33,380
In this case

104
00:05:33,380 --> 00:05:36,540
The victim's wallet was discovered inside your bag

105
00:05:36,540 --> 00:05:37,700
This is true is it not?

106
00:05:37,860 --> 00:05:40,780
Well it's true that the wallet was inside my bag but

107
00:05:41,220 --> 00:05:41,900
I didn't take it

108
00:05:41,900 --> 00:05:44,940
Did you ever think "I did something bad"?

109
00:05:44,940 --> 00:05:47,260
No I didn't, because I didn't take it

110
00:05:48,020 --> 00:05:54,420
Even with these absurd developments

111
00:05:50,900 --> 00:05:54,420
He does not deny the events, instead

112
00:05:54,420 --> 00:05:59,900
He insists on the single point "I didn't take it"

113
00:06:00,140 --> 00:06:02,980
The defendant's actions were extremely malicious

114
00:06:02,980 --> 00:06:06,460
He completely denies the crime and shows absolutely no remorse

115
00:06:06,460 --> 00:06:07,500
We seek a death penalty

116
00:06:07,660 --> 00:06:09,620
Death? Isn't that too harsh?

117
00:06:13,620 --> 00:06:18,420
Theft receives death penalty

118
00:06:14,020 --> 00:06:16,580
Death?

119
00:06:15,860 --> 00:06:16,580
Death?

120
00:06:16,580 --> 00:06:18,420
Defendant

121
00:06:17,540 --> 00:06:18,420
be silent

122
00:06:18,700 --> 00:06:21,580
Defense, any objections?

123
00:06:21,860 --> 00:06:22,500
None

124
00:06:22,660 --> 00:06:24,340
Why are you even here?

125
00:06:24,340 --> 00:06:26,620
What are you even here for? Seriously

126
00:06:27,780 --> 00:06:31,740
"I'm Sorry" "I apologize to the victim" If you said something like that

127
00:06:31,740 --> 00:06:33,940
There could have been some consideration

128
00:06:34,100 --> 00:06:35,540
But you have done none of that

129
00:06:35,540 --> 00:06:37,580
So if I apologize I avoid the death penalty?

130
00:06:37,780 --> 00:06:38,820
So you admit your crime?

131
00:06:40,180 --> 00:06:43,140
I don't know if I admit, but I'd like to apologize

132
00:06:43,140 --> 00:06:44,820
You confess to stealing right?

133
00:06:45,020 --> 00:06:48,860
If pleading guilty will avoid the death penalty

134
00:06:48,860 --> 00:06:50,740
then I'll take it

135
00:06:50,740 --> 00:06:52,060
Alright then

136
00:06:52,540 --> 00:06:56,340
I am ready to give the sentence

137
00:06:56,340 --> 00:06:58,500
Sentence is

138
00:06:58,300 --> 00:06:58,500
Death

139
00:06:58,660 --> 00:07:00,900
It's still death?

140
00:07:00,900 --> 00:07:02,500
In the end it's still death?

141
00:07:05,660 --> 00:07:12,180
It's still death

142
00:07:07,420 --> 00:07:08,260
Let's go

143
00:07:08,540 --> 00:07:10,620
"Let's go", you mean to die?

144
00:07:10,620 --> 00:07:12,180
I don't want to die

145
00:07:12,460 --> 00:07:13,540
Who'd want to die?

146
00:07:13,540 --> 00:07:16,220
Don't tell me to "be quiet" if it's death

147
00:07:16,220 --> 00:07:17,580
I don't want to die

148
00:07:17,580 --> 00:07:19,140
Death? Hey!

149
00:07:18,780 --> 00:07:24,140
Death Row Inmate Kotouge is transferred to a prison set

150
00:07:21,620 --> 00:07:23,620
There's still more!?

151
00:07:23,620 --> 00:07:27,020
This is so long

152
00:07:27,060 --> 00:07:30,180
Your execution is tomorrow, wait here

153
00:07:29,180 --> 00:07:31,020
Tomorrow!?

154
00:07:31,300 --> 00:07:33,980
How long is this gonna go...
