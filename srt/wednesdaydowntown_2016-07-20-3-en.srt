1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
What the hell is this?

2
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,450
Alright our next theory is

3
00:00:02,450 --> 00:00:08,680
Reverse Prank: If you keep reversing it, you'll become suspicious

4
00:00:08,700 --> 00:00:11,540
What, I don't get it

5
00:00:11,540 --> 00:00:14,420
Reverse prank...

6
00:00:15,460 --> 00:00:17,660
You know what a reverse prank is right?

7
00:00:17,660 --> 00:00:23,450
For example if Kato was pranking Hamada

8
00:00:23,450 --> 00:00:27,460
But Hamada already knows about it

9
00:00:27,460 --> 00:00:30,420
So Hamada becomes super angry

10
00:00:30,420 --> 00:00:34,360
And Kato becomes scared

11
00:00:34,360 --> 00:00:37,970
And the roles are reversed, a reverse prank

12
00:00:37,970 --> 00:00:41,980
After Hamada gets mad, he starts crying

13
00:00:41,980 --> 00:00:43,940
He keeps crying and crying

14
00:00:43,940 --> 00:00:46,250
Hamada's thinks

15
00:00:46,250 --> 00:00:48,850
"Eh? He's seriously crying"

16
00:00:48,850 --> 00:00:53,050
And then it's on Hamada

17
00:00:53,050 --> 00:00:56,100
But Hamada also already knows about this

18
00:00:56,100 --> 00:00:58,600
So this is reverse reverse

19
00:00:57,010 --> 00:01:01,080
Right, and then another reverse

20
00:01:01,080 --> 00:01:04,450
And Hamada gets mad again

21
00:01:04,450 --> 00:01:05,580
And then they wonder

22
00:01:05,580 --> 00:01:07,810
How far does this go?

23
00:01:08,010 --> 00:01:11,020
Of course they will!

24
00:01:11,970 --> 00:01:14,370
This isn't a theory!

25
00:01:14,370 --> 00:01:16,250
That's exactly what's going to happen!

26
00:01:14,900 --> 00:01:16,220
Really?

27
00:01:16,770 --> 00:01:24,600
Reverse Prank: If you keep reversing it, you'll become suspicious

28
00:01:25,930 --> 00:01:29,560
Viking's Kotouge Eiji

29
00:01:31,340 --> 00:01:35,760
First, we pretend some fake show

30
00:01:37,380 --> 00:01:38,820
Alright let's begin

31
00:01:38,820 --> 00:01:42,710
Let's meet this weeks special first-time guest

32
00:01:42,710 --> 00:01:44,050
Come on!

33
00:01:46,250 --> 00:01:50,290
Haraichi's Sawabe Yuu

34
00:01:50,980 --> 00:01:53,980
This time, these two prank specialists

35
00:01:53,980 --> 00:01:57,180
Will reverse prank each other

36
00:01:58,680 --> 00:02:04,290
And now, in this room the challenge starts

37
00:02:05,490 --> 00:02:09,880
First Kotouge will prank Sawabe

38
00:02:11,880 --> 00:02:15,210
So you two will be in a room together

39
00:02:15,210 --> 00:02:20,700
At some point you'll leave the room

40
00:02:20,700 --> 00:02:26,370
During that time, Kotouge will switch your chair out

41
00:02:26,370 --> 00:02:27,810
Okay

42
00:02:27,810 --> 00:02:29,900
Then

43
00:02:29,900 --> 00:02:35,400
When you return and sit down, it will break

44
00:02:36,660 --> 00:02:39,080
Ahh, that's a classic one isn't it

45
00:02:39,080 --> 00:02:42,940
This is reverse prank, so you have to play along

46
00:02:43,240 --> 00:02:47,480
Oh, I see, okay

47
00:02:47,480 --> 00:02:51,140
I should be surprised

48
00:02:56,680 --> 00:02:58,960
Sorry

49
00:02:57,340 --> 00:02:58,960
Go ahead

50
00:03:03,400 --> 00:03:08,730
Hello? Yeah

51
00:03:03,960 --> 00:03:08,730
What the heck this is this room

52
00:03:09,210 --> 00:03:11,860
It's scary, this room

53
00:03:15,470 --> 00:03:22,040
Broken Chair

54
00:03:29,620 --> 00:03:32,340
That's an evil face

55
00:03:42,030 --> 00:03:43,640
Wha, ow ow!

56
00:03:55,250 --> 00:03:58,880
Pranked~

57
00:04:00,330 --> 00:04:02,600
What the hell is this!

58
00:04:03,900 --> 00:04:05,020
Don't "hahaha"

59
00:04:05,020 --> 00:04:06,940
Such an idiot~

60
00:04:07,610 --> 00:04:11,330
Then Sawabe will feign an injury

61
00:04:11,330 --> 00:04:16,920
And when Kotouge gets close, he'll get sprayed with water, a reverse prank

62
00:04:17,840 --> 00:04:23,610
But of course, all of this has already been explained to Kotouge

63
00:04:23,610 --> 00:04:25,540
Then Sawabe sprays me

64
00:04:25,540 --> 00:04:27,280
oh I see I see

65
00:04:27,280 --> 00:04:30,050
And I play along right?

66
00:04:30,050 --> 00:04:31,020
Right

67
00:04:31,960 --> 00:04:37,650
For the reverse reverse prank, he lets himself get sprayed

68
00:04:37,960 --> 00:04:41,390
I'm bleeding...

69
00:04:39,020 --> 00:04:41,390
No way, really?

70
00:04:41,390 --> 00:04:44,200
Woah sorry

71
00:04:42,660 --> 00:04:44,200
Around here...

72
00:04:42,840 --> 00:04:45,050
The acting...

73
00:04:46,000 --> 00:04:47,690
Seriously? Sorry sorry sorry

74
00:04:47,140 --> 00:04:48,760
Look

75
00:04:54,480 --> 00:04:56,700
Oi! Sawabe Oi!

76
00:04:57,410 --> 00:05:02,080
Sorry the blood, I'm bleeding a lot

77
00:05:07,340 --> 00:05:09,640
So stupid

78
00:05:08,160 --> 00:05:12,080
Reverse Prank Success!

79
00:05:12,080 --> 00:05:13,460
What the heck?

80
00:05:13,460 --> 00:05:15,960
It's been decided

81
00:05:15,960 --> 00:05:18,260
What reverse prank?

82
00:05:18,260 --> 00:05:20,230
I wasn't hurt at all!

83
00:05:20,230 --> 00:05:21,400
Seriously?

84
00:05:22,020 --> 00:05:28,200
And then, mud will fall on you

85
00:05:28,200 --> 00:05:29,410
Okay

86
00:05:30,130 --> 00:05:33,970
This a reverse reverse prank

87
00:05:31,410 --> 00:05:33,970
A reverse reverse prank...

88
00:05:46,630 --> 00:05:49,030
You're kidding me!

89
00:05:49,370 --> 00:05:53,770
Then after that, you'll get a towel

90
00:05:53,770 --> 00:05:57,820
That towel will stink

91
00:05:57,820 --> 00:06:02,780
And it will have some black ink

92
00:06:03,620 --> 00:06:05,770
Here for the "blood"

93
00:06:07,060 --> 00:06:11,100
If you wanna complain, look what you did to my face

94
00:06:09,080 --> 00:06:11,120
Yeah I got you kind of dirty

95
00:06:12,840 --> 00:06:14,890
Ah it stinks!

96
00:06:17,020 --> 00:06:19,860
What what? Your face is all black

97
00:06:25,630 --> 00:06:27,870
What the hell is this, so gross

98
00:06:28,540 --> 00:06:32,240
And now, the reverse reverse reverse prank is over

99
00:06:33,170 --> 00:06:38,400
That will be Sawabe's last prank

100
00:06:42,010 --> 00:06:44,850
Then

101
00:06:43,620 --> 00:06:44,850
Yeah

102
00:06:44,850 --> 00:06:46,260
There's still more?

103
00:06:46,260 --> 00:06:50,090
After that, is the real prank

104
00:06:50,090 --> 00:06:52,590
Hmm...

105
00:06:53,020 --> 00:06:55,690
Then, that prank will be

106
00:06:56,250 --> 00:07:02,450
An object near the room entrace will explode when Kotouge presses a switch

107
00:07:03,240 --> 00:07:08,260
After the towel, shouldn't they have come in? The staff

108
00:07:08,260 --> 00:07:11,540
They come in now right? Enter the room

109
00:07:11,680 --> 00:07:13,040
They haven't come in still

110
00:07:13,040 --> 00:07:16,280
If they don't come in soon, the smell will stick to me

111
00:07:17,020 --> 00:07:18,950
The staff?

112
00:07:21,350 --> 00:07:23,460
None none none

113
00:07:21,750 --> 00:07:24,520
There's no more right?

114
00:07:24,730 --> 00:07:25,740
There's nothing left

115
00:07:25,740 --> 00:07:27,690
After this what could there be?

116
00:07:27,930 --> 00:07:31,930
Yeah yeah, I guess that's true

117
00:07:55,320 --> 00:07:57,160
Pranked~

118
00:07:59,020 --> 00:08:03,030
Reverse reverse reverse reverse pranked~

119
00:08:04,930 --> 00:08:07,070
This sucks...

120
00:08:07,070 --> 00:08:09,870
This sucks, seriously

121
00:08:10,240 --> 00:08:12,870
But actually...

122
00:08:12,870 --> 00:08:15,010
Then you'll go towards the door

123
00:08:15,010 --> 00:08:22,180
At that time, a nearby object will explode

124
00:08:20,360 --> 00:08:22,500
He knew

125
00:08:22,180 --> 00:08:24,120
Kotouge will press a switch

126
00:08:22,500 --> 00:08:24,140
Sawabe's acting is great

127
00:08:24,120 --> 00:08:29,350
But Kotouge will think this is the real prank

128
00:08:26,790 --> 00:08:29,350
Right

129
00:08:29,800 --> 00:08:32,860
I have to pretend I don't know

130
00:08:33,520 --> 00:08:37,820
Sawabe has known everything the whole time

131
00:08:38,530 --> 00:08:41,040
Now the actual last one is this

132
00:08:41,040 --> 00:08:46,410
Sawabe will press a button to light sparklers above Kotouge

133
00:08:46,410 --> 00:08:49,130
A reverse reverse reverse reverse reverse prank

134
00:08:47,780 --> 00:08:49,530
What a scary picture

135
00:08:49,530 --> 00:08:51,500
He already has no hair

136
00:08:50,540 --> 00:08:55,750
This will be the last one

137
00:08:56,680 --> 00:08:59,180
That's the end of it right?

138
00:08:59,180 --> 00:09:00,890
This is the end

139
00:09:01,290 --> 00:09:04,020
You should've expected the explosion prank

140
00:09:04,190 --> 00:09:06,120
No why would I think of that

141
00:09:06,360 --> 00:09:07,990
What is this?

142
00:09:07,940 --> 00:09:10,370
Over here is a switch

143
00:09:08,660 --> 00:09:10,630
Who... Did the staff do this?

144
00:09:10,630 --> 00:09:13,970
Fireworks Switch

145
00:09:12,410 --> 00:09:14,160
I had no idea

146
00:09:14,770 --> 00:09:16,570
Hot! Hot hot!

147
00:09:18,290 --> 00:09:20,920
He disappeared!

148
00:09:20,920 --> 00:09:23,220
He disappeared for a second

149
00:09:31,680 --> 00:09:34,210
You could see his skeleton there

150
00:09:34,250 --> 00:09:36,190
Eh?

151
00:09:36,190 --> 00:09:39,060
Hot!

152
00:09:39,060 --> 00:09:43,190
Wait a second, I thought it ended with the explosion

153
00:09:43,190 --> 00:09:46,200
Wasn't that the last one? Seriously

154
00:09:46,200 --> 00:09:46,730
Eh?

155
00:09:51,800 --> 00:09:53,060
Seriously?

156
00:09:53,070 --> 00:10:01,450
Reverse reverse reverse reverse reverse prank success!

157
00:10:01,450 --> 00:10:02,750
Seriously?

158
00:10:03,370 --> 00:10:06,640
Now the prank is actually over

159
00:10:06,640 --> 00:10:09,970
After this we test our main theory

160
00:10:09,970 --> 00:10:13,360
Whether or not they'll get suspicious

161
00:10:13,360 --> 00:10:14,680
Of course

162
00:10:14,790 --> 00:10:16,560
After the explosion are fireworks

163
00:10:16,560 --> 00:10:19,720
The finale ends with fireworks

164
00:10:20,900 --> 00:10:23,170
That was incredible

165
00:10:23,170 --> 00:10:26,810
Wait Sawabe, that's it right?

166
00:10:26,970 --> 00:10:28,410
Tell me that was the real one

167
00:10:28,410 --> 00:10:31,040
I'm seriously, I'm serious here

168
00:10:31,780 --> 00:10:33,650
I'm done, that was the last one

169
00:10:33,650 --> 00:10:35,950
That's why I was surprised, seriously

170
00:10:36,380 --> 00:10:39,480
I'm also done, I've pulled them all

171
00:10:39,750 --> 00:10:42,190
You're serious?

172
00:10:41,150 --> 00:10:42,190
I am

173
00:10:42,450 --> 00:10:46,290
The order is—It's you isn't it?

174
00:10:46,610 --> 00:10:49,560
Sawabe, I'm seriously done

175
00:10:49,960 --> 00:10:51,700
I don't have anything else

176
00:10:51,700 --> 00:10:56,670
Why the staff still haven't entered, I don't know

177
00:10:56,670 --> 00:10:59,470
That's why I'm thinking "There's still more isn't there?"

178
00:11:00,170 --> 00:11:03,210
You're getting too suspicious

179
00:11:03,610 --> 00:11:06,010
I can't trust you!

180
00:11:06,560 --> 00:11:08,050
You still have something don't you!

181
00:11:08,050 --> 00:11:11,120
I don't! I ended with the fireworks

182
00:11:12,050 --> 00:11:13,590
No you still have something...

183
00:11:13,590 --> 00:11:16,760
What the hell, you still have something!

184
00:11:16,760 --> 00:11:17,990
No no, you still have something

185
00:11:17,990 --> 00:11:20,060
I don't have anything

186
00:11:20,370 --> 00:11:22,160
You still have something right?

187
00:11:22,160 --> 00:11:23,600
Bring it out

188
00:11:23,900 --> 00:11:26,000
If you have something, bring it out!

189
00:11:26,200 --> 00:11:27,170
There's nothing!

190
00:11:27,170 --> 00:11:28,300
There's is something, yeah?

191
00:11:29,830 --> 00:11:30,600
What are you doing

192
00:11:31,470 --> 00:11:32,300
No you're wrong

193
00:11:32,300 --> 00:11:33,040
Wait wait wait

194
00:11:33,040 --> 00:11:34,410
You've got something like this don't you?

195
00:11:34,060 --> 00:11:35,010
No no no

196
00:11:35,010 --> 00:11:35,610
Wait wait

197
00:11:35,610 --> 00:11:37,910
Sawabe, you, oi!

198
00:11:37,020 --> 00:11:38,650
Let me check

199
00:11:37,910 --> 00:11:39,110
There's nothing, Sawabe!

200
00:11:39,110 --> 00:11:42,210
You you you, oi! Sawabe!

201
00:11:42,280 --> 00:11:44,330
Do you have nothing?

202
00:11:44,330 --> 00:11:49,460
The suspicion continues for over 10 minutes

203
00:11:49,590 --> 00:11:51,590
There's probably nothing else, both of us

204
00:11:51,590 --> 00:11:55,130
Yeah, it looks like we're both finished

205
00:11:56,220 --> 00:11:58,130
Let's go together

206
00:11:58,130 --> 00:12:01,670
Geez, what is this

207
00:12:02,870 --> 00:12:05,100
We're gonna hold hands?

208
00:12:07,270 --> 00:12:09,110
What are you doing

209
00:12:09,110 --> 00:12:10,880
What are you doing seriously

210
00:12:10,880 --> 00:12:12,480
I'm not doing anything

211
00:12:12,480 --> 00:12:14,480
Nothing right?

212
00:12:15,850 --> 00:12:19,380
This is scary, this dark hallway

213
00:12:19,720 --> 00:12:21,390
We're going?

214
00:12:20,090 --> 00:12:21,390
Yeah

215
00:12:22,550 --> 00:12:23,720
Let's open it quickly

216
00:12:26,660 --> 00:12:28,530
Ah you surprised me

217
00:12:28,530 --> 00:12:30,030
C'mon geez!

218
00:12:30,520 --> 00:12:37,360
If you pull a reverse reverse reverse reverse reverse prank, you'll become super suspicious

219
00:12:37,360 --> 00:12:39,500
Of course you would

220
00:12:39,500 --> 00:12:41,770
As expected, they became suspicious

221
00:12:41,770 --> 00:12:43,880
Yeah, that was funny

222
00:12:43,880 --> 00:12:47,250
Sawabe was great right

223
00:12:47,250 --> 00:12:48,860
Sawabe's acting was great

224
00:12:49,050 --> 00:12:51,380
Kotouge was terrible though

225
00:12:51,930 --> 00:12:54,450
When the fireworks went off on Kotouge

226
00:12:54,450 --> 00:12:56,820
You could see his skeleton

227
00:12:56,820 --> 00:12:58,330
Maybe I was seeing things

228
00:12:58,420 --> 00:13:00,990
Like the electric shocks in anime

229
00:13:00,990 --> 00:13:07,070
