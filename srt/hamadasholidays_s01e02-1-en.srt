1
00:00:03,130 --> 00:00:07,630
Hamada's Holiday in Guam.

2
00:00:08,530 --> 00:00:15,450
When you first get to know people,
they keep a distance. About this far.

3
00:00:16,060 --> 00:00:20,380
Now, Dorians are close to me like this.

4
00:00:20,460 --> 00:00:22,100
It almost hurts.

5
00:00:22,660 --> 00:00:27,230
They're very close,
and I think they sometimes forget...

6
00:00:28,960 --> 00:00:30,530
...that I'm their senior.

7
00:00:33,400 --> 00:00:36,860
Talking in the middle of the night, part one.

8
00:00:37,100 --> 00:00:42,130
"Hamada learns for the first time
about when everyone met him."

9
00:00:42,430 --> 00:00:47,250
We met Downtown for the first time
opening for their program, right?

10
00:00:47,330 --> 00:00:48,900
When did you meet them?

11
00:00:49,200 --> 00:00:53,900
For us, the opportunity to come
to Tokyo from Fukuoka...

12
00:00:54,060 --> 00:00:57,300
...was a talk show called Matsu-Shin.

13
00:00:57,500 --> 00:01:01,860
We were M-1 Grand Prix semifinalists
and invited to be on Matsu-Shin.

14
00:01:01,960 --> 00:01:07,130
We got invited with Pu & Mu and met
Hitoshi Matsumoto of Downtown.

15
00:01:07,330 --> 00:01:09,900
He asked, "Are you coming to Tokyo?"

16
00:01:10,000 --> 00:01:12,630
We met Shinsuke Shimada there too.

17
00:01:12,900 --> 00:01:16,630
So we answered, "We would like to come but..."

18
00:01:16,860 --> 00:01:19,250
Matsumoto said we should,
and Shinsuke said to him,

19
00:01:19,450 --> 00:01:23,860
"You should let them open for your shows."

20
00:01:24,130 --> 00:01:25,480
Matsumoto answered,

21
00:01:25,560 --> 00:01:30,900
"I can't, since Hamada decides everything."

22
00:01:31,860 --> 00:01:34,380
Yeah, that's what he said.

23
00:01:34,460 --> 00:01:38,330
We decided to go to Tokyo that year.

24
00:01:39,230 --> 00:01:40,950
It must have been luck.

25
00:01:41,030 --> 00:01:43,480
Our first job was opening for Downtown.

26
00:01:43,560 --> 00:01:45,160
Which was HEY! HEY! HEY!

27
00:01:46,930 --> 00:01:48,520
You opened for that show?

28
00:01:48,600 --> 00:01:50,800
From then on, we did it all.

29
00:01:51,040 --> 00:01:56,500
Now we're able to work on
various sets with Downtown.

30
00:01:56,930 --> 00:02:00,350
They often say their dressing rooms are separate,

31
00:02:00,430 --> 00:02:04,080
and when I heard that, I didn't believe it.

32
00:02:04,160 --> 00:02:08,160
But it's true.
They're separated until filming begins.

33
00:02:08,460 --> 00:02:10,950
Our manager, Nagae.

34
00:02:11,150 --> 00:02:15,220
He's been with us for long.

35
00:02:15,300 --> 00:02:20,080
When he was a rookie dressed in a suit,
we did our first opening act.

36
00:02:20,260 --> 00:02:22,660
He was still new to TV work then.

37
00:02:23,160 --> 00:02:24,380
You were new too.

38
00:02:24,460 --> 00:02:29,080
He asked what we're supposed to do,
but it was our first day.

39
00:02:29,160 --> 00:02:30,700
None of us knew.

40
00:02:31,100 --> 00:02:34,620
The guy in the suit didn't know,
so we were at a loss.

41
00:02:34,700 --> 00:02:38,980
We decided to greet Downtown,
who were in different dressing rooms.

42
00:02:39,060 --> 00:02:44,930
We didn't know who to go see first,
Matsumoto or Hamada.

43
00:02:45,230 --> 00:02:50,200
Someone told us where Matsumoto was,
so we decided to see him first.

44
00:02:50,560 --> 00:02:53,430
Matsumoto was reading a newspaper.

45
00:02:53,660 --> 00:02:59,200
We said, "Our name is Dorians.
We'll be the opening act."

46
00:02:59,500 --> 00:03:03,660
And he answered, "Dorians? Oh, that's not good."

47
00:03:04,100 --> 00:03:06,520
We asked, "Not good?"

48
00:03:06,600 --> 00:03:10,130
He said, "Well, I don't think that's good."

49
00:03:10,630 --> 00:03:12,720
I started sweating.

50
00:03:12,800 --> 00:03:16,060
I didn't get it. He said, "Your name is not good."

51
00:03:16,400 --> 00:03:19,360
"Hamada is extremely mad about you guys."

52
00:03:19,550 --> 00:03:20,600
Really?

53
00:03:20,700 --> 00:03:24,920
We went to see Matsumoto first,

54
00:03:25,000 --> 00:03:28,560
so we were late greeting Hamada.

55
00:03:28,730 --> 00:03:31,950
Oh, I see. You didn't know how things worked.

56
00:03:32,030 --> 00:03:34,130
We were late greeting him.

57
00:03:34,530 --> 00:03:37,050
-Matsumoto just said that.
-Yes.

58
00:03:37,260 --> 00:03:39,260
We were told Hamada was angry.

59
00:03:39,900 --> 00:03:41,450
That's nerve-racking.

60
00:03:41,530 --> 00:03:45,630
Our first TV work! We thought,
"We had to greet Hamada first."

61
00:03:46,060 --> 00:03:50,230
Then Matsumoto advised,
"You should go apologize."

62
00:03:50,530 --> 00:03:54,130
We thanked him and said we'd do that.

63
00:03:54,230 --> 00:03:57,550
We knocked on Hamada's door and apologized.

64
00:03:57,630 --> 00:03:59,280
"We're truly sorry."

65
00:03:59,360 --> 00:04:01,730
We could only say sorry.

66
00:04:02,000 --> 00:04:06,600
We apologized about our name,
but Hamada started laughing.

67
00:04:07,130 --> 00:04:09,680
We were confused and didn't understand.

68
00:04:09,760 --> 00:04:11,980
We had just met.

69
00:04:12,060 --> 00:04:14,150
Hamada was laughing just like this.

70
00:04:14,230 --> 00:04:17,260
He said, "Hang on." He yelled, "Matsumoto!"

71
00:04:17,460 --> 00:04:20,180
He said to him, "What did you tell them?!"

72
00:04:20,260 --> 00:04:22,230
This was at a dressing room.

73
00:04:22,500 --> 00:04:27,400
He left his dressing room
and went over to where Matsumoto was.

74
00:04:27,500 --> 00:04:29,280
"You must have said something!"

75
00:04:29,360 --> 00:04:31,330
Wow, that's unbelievable.

76
00:04:31,860 --> 00:04:36,180
I knew right away by Dorians' behavior
that he had said something.

77
00:04:36,260 --> 00:04:38,820
After he went there and came back,

78
00:04:38,900 --> 00:04:42,360
we were confused, saying, "What's happening?"

79
00:04:42,730 --> 00:04:45,180
We were the only ones laughing.

80
00:04:45,260 --> 00:04:47,860
We thought, "Downtown gets along well."

81
00:04:48,900 --> 00:04:53,100
I didn't get it, because I thought
they didn't get along.

82
00:04:53,260 --> 00:04:58,630
He smacked Matsumoto,
and everyone laughed, so I was confused.

83
00:05:00,530 --> 00:05:05,530
We asked Nagae if it was normal
to be pranked, but he didn't know.

84
00:05:06,730 --> 00:05:11,050
We asked the other crew,
and they said that never happens.

85
00:05:11,130 --> 00:05:16,500
They said Hamada never goes to see
Matsumoto before a show.

86
00:05:18,800 --> 00:05:21,800
That was our first meeting with Downtown.

87
00:05:22,630 --> 00:05:23,580
The very first time.

88
00:05:23,660 --> 00:05:24,760
That's nice.

89
00:05:25,860 --> 00:05:31,230
They weren't scary.
They were kind and really got along.

90
00:05:31,400 --> 00:05:33,300
That was our impression.

91
00:05:33,930 --> 00:05:35,480
My image of them changed.

92
00:05:35,560 --> 00:05:40,680
Even to this day,
Downtown doesn't share a dressing room,

93
00:05:40,760 --> 00:05:43,360
so recalling it now, that was shocking.

94
00:05:43,600 --> 00:05:46,400
That was the first and last time.

95
00:05:46,500 --> 00:05:49,430
The first and last time that happened.

96
00:05:49,760 --> 00:05:52,150
-But you had met Hirai.
-Right.

97
00:05:52,230 --> 00:05:55,220
I brought him along when we went out.

98
00:05:55,300 --> 00:05:59,100
He was so nervous he ordered
a rice omelet and plain rice.

99
00:05:59,200 --> 00:06:01,020
Of course I was nervous.

100
00:06:01,100 --> 00:06:04,080
-Rice omelet and plain rice? Rice with rice?
-Yes.

101
00:06:04,160 --> 00:06:05,480
That's what he got.

102
00:06:05,560 --> 00:06:07,560
I told him to order something.

103
00:06:08,760 --> 00:06:11,520
We went to Mishuku, the three of us.

104
00:06:11,600 --> 00:06:15,420
I had just gotten used to Inomoto,
then Hamada showed up.

105
00:06:15,500 --> 00:06:18,030
-And I invited you suddenly too.
-Yeah, that's right.

106
00:06:18,630 --> 00:06:23,360
Hamada invited me to dinner,
so I asked if I could bring him.

107
00:06:23,530 --> 00:06:26,950
He was shocked when I said
he'd be seeing Hamada.

108
00:06:27,200 --> 00:06:28,360
That's normal.

109
00:06:29,130 --> 00:06:35,460
He's relaxed now, sitting near Hamada
banging his head on the chair laughing.

110
00:06:36,200 --> 00:06:39,230
But at that dinner, he sat like a samurai.

111
00:06:40,000 --> 00:06:42,230
Of course, you'd be nervous.

112
00:06:42,360 --> 00:06:45,230
We all experienced that.

113
00:06:45,360 --> 00:06:48,460
All his replies sounded like hisses.

114
00:06:49,100 --> 00:06:51,230
Sounds like you're leaking air.

115
00:06:54,060 --> 00:06:55,200
"Hiss..."

116
00:06:56,400 --> 00:06:59,480
-"You're full?" "Hiss..."
-Yeah, I really did that.

117
00:06:59,560 --> 00:07:03,750
Hamada told him
to order something, and Hamada said,

118
00:07:03,830 --> 00:07:05,350
"Hurry up and decide!"

119
00:07:05,430 --> 00:07:08,920
So Hirai got a rice omelet,
and Hamada asked if it's enough.

120
00:07:09,000 --> 00:07:10,960
So he ordered plain rice too.

121
00:07:11,860 --> 00:07:13,730
Hamada said, "You're weird."

122
00:07:14,730 --> 00:07:17,760
"Rice omelet and rice?" "Hiss."

123
00:07:19,360 --> 00:07:21,220
When did you meet Downtown?

124
00:07:21,300 --> 00:07:22,780
I...

125
00:07:22,860 --> 00:07:25,330
-You haven't met them yet?
-Not yet.

126
00:07:26,100 --> 00:07:27,230
Who is that?

127
00:07:28,560 --> 00:07:30,360
He's been sitting there.

128
00:07:32,330 --> 00:07:34,830
He's been sitting there for a while.

129
00:07:35,600 --> 00:07:40,080
I met Masayoshi long before Hirai.
He's the first one.

130
00:07:40,160 --> 00:07:43,130
He met Hamada before all of you.

131
00:07:44,360 --> 00:07:45,360
You were?

132
00:07:46,460 --> 00:07:48,220
It wasn't work related,

133
00:07:48,300 --> 00:07:52,100
but I was invited to Mishuku
with Inomoto out of the blue.

134
00:07:52,200 --> 00:07:54,500
I was surprised when he called.

135
00:07:55,530 --> 00:07:56,480
When was this?

136
00:07:56,560 --> 00:07:58,630
A long time ago.

137
00:07:59,500 --> 00:08:01,450
You've known Hamada for long.

138
00:08:01,530 --> 00:08:02,730
He's the longest.

139
00:08:03,100 --> 00:08:05,280
Over ten years.

140
00:08:05,360 --> 00:08:09,360
You've been around for my moving.

141
00:08:09,930 --> 00:08:14,730
I ordered him to come to Shinjuku
and made him pack with me.

142
00:08:14,960 --> 00:08:17,700
-I packed for him.
-You did that?

143
00:08:17,800 --> 00:08:22,480
Inomoto, you were at work,
and I had to get it done.

144
00:08:22,560 --> 00:08:24,000
So you asked him.

145
00:08:24,330 --> 00:08:28,580
Inomoto used to look after me back then,

146
00:08:28,660 --> 00:08:32,880
and even though I lived far,
he'd invite me out for drinks.

147
00:08:32,960 --> 00:08:38,330
Inomoto told me to move closer,
so I moved close to his house.

148
00:08:38,630 --> 00:08:40,760
We became closer after that.

149
00:08:41,560 --> 00:08:46,180
I'm not a graduate of Tokyo NSC.

150
00:08:46,260 --> 00:08:47,280
Right.

151
00:08:47,360 --> 00:08:52,720
I entered Yoshimoto
as Ikuyo Kuruyo's apprentice.

152
00:08:52,800 --> 00:08:56,400
So surprisingly, Hamada
has known Masayoshi for long.

153
00:08:56,700 --> 00:08:58,280
I didn't know.

154
00:08:58,360 --> 00:09:01,720
I think it's over 15 years.

155
00:09:01,800 --> 00:09:04,130
Masayoshi is the oldest one.

156
00:09:04,430 --> 00:09:05,760
Yes, I am.

157
00:09:06,030 --> 00:09:09,420
We spend more time outside work.

158
00:09:09,500 --> 00:09:11,700
I've never worked with Masayoshi.

159
00:09:14,400 --> 00:09:15,460
Really?

160
00:09:15,600 --> 00:09:17,620
-Yes.
-After all this time?

161
00:09:17,700 --> 00:09:22,480
He's done opening acts for some of my shows.

162
00:09:22,560 --> 00:09:25,920
No studio filming or on location?

163
00:09:26,000 --> 00:09:27,030
No.

164
00:09:27,600 --> 00:09:31,230
-I haven't.
-So you haven't met Downtown yet.

165
00:09:31,400 --> 00:09:33,660
I thought so. Who is that man?

166
00:09:34,260 --> 00:09:36,680
-Not Hamada.
-Right, Matsumoto.

167
00:09:36,760 --> 00:09:41,130
We've opened for HEY! HEY! HEY! too.

168
00:09:41,260 --> 00:09:46,860
We opened for most of Shinsuke's programs then.

169
00:09:47,030 --> 00:09:50,230
Because he's my master's fellow pupil.

170
00:09:50,330 --> 00:09:54,920
So we opened for all of
the programs Shinsuke was involved in.

171
00:09:55,000 --> 00:09:56,800
That led to opening for Downtown.

172
00:09:57,100 --> 00:10:02,420
Once, Downtown hosted Shinsuke's program.

173
00:10:02,500 --> 00:10:04,260
To help him, yes.

174
00:10:04,360 --> 00:10:06,680
We did the opening act then,

175
00:10:06,760 --> 00:10:12,430
which led us to open for Downtown's
programs like HEY! HEY! HEY!

176
00:10:13,100 --> 00:10:18,320
Back then, my impressions
of Hamada at work and outside of work...

177
00:10:18,400 --> 00:10:20,460
...were completely different.

178
00:10:20,830 --> 00:10:23,500
We were still scared of him.

179
00:10:23,700 --> 00:10:29,760
Well, you two of Dorians have
a different relationship with him,

180
00:10:30,100 --> 00:10:35,360
but I still feel a distance between Hamada and I.

181
00:10:35,460 --> 00:10:38,060
In your relationship with him, right?

182
00:10:38,300 --> 00:10:41,430
-I get nervous.
-He was scary back then.

183
00:10:42,230 --> 00:10:44,350
-He was very scary.
-Oh yeah?

184
00:10:44,550 --> 00:10:50,220
I still remember my master Ikuyo saying,
"Hamada appears on TV like that,"

185
00:10:50,300 --> 00:10:52,730
"but he's actually very reliable."

186
00:10:53,130 --> 00:10:57,460
She told me,
"Don't mimic how rowdy he is on TV!"

187
00:10:57,900 --> 00:11:00,100
-How's he in real life?
-Rowdy.

188
00:11:00,700 --> 00:11:03,660
He was nothing like what Ikuyo said.

189
00:11:04,660 --> 00:11:06,330
-Just rowdy?
-Yes.

190
00:11:07,060 --> 00:11:12,500
We ate ramen yesterday, so I offered
to pour beer, but he said not to worry.

191
00:11:12,660 --> 00:11:17,500
He told me to just pour him beer
when he got too old to do so.

192
00:11:17,760 --> 00:11:19,280
When the pot stickers came,

193
00:11:19,360 --> 00:11:22,380
he yelled at me to hurry with the soy sauce.

194
00:11:22,460 --> 00:11:24,120
I don't understand.

195
00:11:24,200 --> 00:11:25,180
He's crazy.

196
00:11:25,260 --> 00:11:27,560
He's rowdy like Rambo.

197
00:11:29,100 --> 00:11:32,650
-Rambo.
-He's Rambo.
