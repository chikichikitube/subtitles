00:00:00,820 --> 00:00:04,340
Sensei, this is your line for later.

3
00:00:05,390 --> 00:00:07,340
Sensei, it's "Daigorou".

8
00:00:18,040 --> 00:00:18,640
Nishikawa-kun!

9
00:00:21,500 --> 00:00:24,590
Listen Nishikawa-kun, your line is "Chan".

10
00:00:25,650 --> 00:00:27,220
Look at this!

11
00:00:28,250 --> 00:00:29,050
Nishikawa-kun!

12
00:00:29,050 --> 00:00:31,350
Here, read it... Nishikawa-kun!

13
00:00:33,620 --> 00:00:34,220
You're noisy!

14
00:00:34,820 --> 00:00:35,890
I'm so...

15
00:00:36,690 --> 00:00:39,090
Nishikawa-kun knows it, stop being persistent.

16
00:00:43,350 --> 00:00:45,100
OK, let's try it.

17
00:00:45,100 --> 00:00:46,800
You guys, make it look real.

18
00:00:46,800 --> 00:00:48,440
OK let's start!

19
00:00:56,800 --> 00:00:58,350
Thank you for waiting!

20
00:00:58,350 --> 00:00:59,300
OK let's do it!

21
00:00:59,790 --> 00:01:01,690
Scene 32, 1st cut!

22
00:01:02,450 --> 00:01:03,420

23
00:01:03,920 --> 00:01:04,720
Start!

24
00:01:05,940 --> 00:01:09,150
Lone Wolf and Cub

25
00:01:46,790 --> 00:01:51,270
Kenichirou~!

26
00:01:47,750 --> 00:01:51,270
Aga so ga!

27
00:01:49,100 --> 00:01:51,270
Ashite ma!

28
00:01:50,300 --> 00:01:51,270
Omae sa!

29
00:01:53,370 --> 00:01:54,240
Cut.

30
00:01:56,540 --> 00:01:57,570
Cut!

31
00:02:00,290 --> 00:02:01,190
Your line...

32
00:02:01,690 --> 00:02:02,640
It's not "Kenichirou".

33
00:02:03,000 --> 00:02:03,540
It's "Daigorou".

34
00:02:04,500 --> 00:02:05,450
That's strange.

35
00:02:05,450 --> 00:02:06,350
Daigorou!

36
00:02:06,800 --> 00:02:07,520
I'm counting on you!

37
00:02:07,520 --> 00:02:08,420
Marry me.

38
00:02:10,520 --> 00:02:11,220
Nishikawa-kun!

39
00:02:12,020 --> 00:02:12,650
Nishikawa-kun!

40
00:02:13,120 --> 00:02:13,790
What did you say?

41
00:02:16,850 --> 00:02:17,550
"Chan!"

42
00:02:17,850 --> 00:02:18,950
Your line is only "Chan".

43
00:02:19,640 --> 00:02:21,150
It isn't a long line.

44
00:02:21,150 --> 00:02:21,640
"Chan"!

45
00:02:22,150 --> 00:02:23,450
When you hear "Daigoro" you say "Chan!"

46
00:02:23,740 --> 00:02:24,500
Nishikawa-kun.

47
00:02:24,500 --> 00:02:25,200
Chan...

48
00:02:26,000 --> 00:02:26,700
Chan...

49
00:02:26,700 --> 00:02:27,770
Yes, Chan!

50
00:02:27,770 --> 00:02:29,770
Say it loudly!

51
00:02:32,570 --> 00:02:33,370
It's okay!

52
00:02:33,370 --> 00:02:34,290
Let's be serious now!

53
00:02:34,290 --> 00:02:36,000
Thank you for waiting!

54
00:02:36,340 --> 00:02:37,990

55
00:02:40,200 --> 00:02:41,790

Cut!

63
00:03:30,200 --> 00:03:31,200
Sensei!

64
00:03:31,200 --> 00:03:32,300
Sensei it's "Daigorou!"

65
00:03:32,300 --> 00:03:33,700
Sensei!

66
00:03:34,270 --> 00:03:35,440
It's "Daigorou!"

67
00:03:35,640 --> 00:03:37,000
Can you memorize the line!?

68
00:03:37,240 --> 00:03:38,440
It's not "Junpei".

69
00:03:39,170 --> 00:03:40,040
Congratulations on your marriage.

70
00:03:40,040 --> 00:03:41,790
Never mind her, your line!

71
00:03:41,790 --> 00:03:42,590
Sensei!

72
00:03:43,040 --> 00:03:44,690
It's "Daigorou".

73
00:03:44,690 --> 00:03:46,090
Please!

74
00:03:46,590 --> 00:03:47,050
Please.

75
00:03:47,390 --> 00:03:48,620
Nishikawa-kun!

76
00:03:49,020 --> 00:03:49,890
Nishikawa-kun!

77
00:03:51,120 --> 00:03:52,120
It's "CHAN!"

78
00:03:52,890 --> 00:03:53,390
You see...

79
00:03:54,990 --> 00:03:56,450
You're overacting!

80
00:04:00,250 --> 00:04:01,750
Don't be a demon!

81
00:04:03,000 --> 00:04:04,040
He spit...

82
00:04:04,040 --> 00:04:05,300
He's just acting!

83
00:04:05,770 --> 00:04:07,870
He spit on the set!

84
00:04:08,370 --> 00:04:09,870
He's trying his best!

85
00:04:12,470 --> 00:04:13,100
Let's start!

86
00:04:17,550 --> 00:04:18,390
OK, Nishikawa-kun...

87
00:04:18,890 --> 00:04:19,550
You have to...

88
00:04:20,150 --> 00:04:21,090
I'm counting on you!

89
00:04:21,350 --> 00:04:21,990
"Chan".

90
00:04:22,620 --> 00:04:23,820
I said it earlier already.

91
00:04:26,320 --> 00:04:27,890
Say it loudly.

92
00:04:27,890 --> 00:04:28,490
Chaaan.

93
00:04:28,490 --> 00:04:29,390
Yes!

94
00:04:31,590 --> 00:04:33,490
See, you can do it.

95
00:04:35,250 --> 00:04:36,100
OK!

96
00:04:36,100 --> 00:04:37,440
Let's continue!

97
00:04:38,370 --> 00:04:39,600
Daigorou it's "Chan!"

98
00:04:39,600 --> 00:04:40,940
You guys are OK!

99
00:04:40,940 --> 00:04:42,270
Get ready!

100
00:04:44,870 --> 00:04:46,940

102
00:04:53,500 --> 00:04:54,220
Ready?

103
00:04:54,850 --> 00:04:55,520
Start!

104
00:04:57,090 --> 00:05:00,320
Lone Wolf and Cub

105
00:05:27,990 --> 00:05:28,870
Daigoro's curry!

106
00:05:27,990 --> 00:05:28,870
Eat

107
00:05:29,240 --> 00:05:31,190

Cut!

113
00:05:37,940 --> 00:05:39,040
What the hell was that?

114
00:05:40,540 --> 00:05:42,150
Soon after "Daigorou" you say "Chan!"

115
00:05:42,540 --> 00:05:43,750
You say "Daigorou" and then it's "Chan!"

116
00:05:43,750 --> 00:05:46,070
Didn't you listen Nishikawa-kun!?

117
00:05:47,200 --> 00:05:48,340
It's part of his act!

118
00:05:48,340 --> 00:05:49,700
Don't mess up my clothes!

119
00:05:51,140 --> 00:05:51,640
I'm sorry.

120
00:05:52,740 --> 00:05:54,290
That's it for today!

00:05:54,800 --> 00:05:57,590

124
00:06:00,620 --> 00:06:01,550
I'm done!

125
00:06:01,890 --> 00:06:02,620
Forget it!
