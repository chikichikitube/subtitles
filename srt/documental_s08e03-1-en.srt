Subbed by Thanos-no-Tsukai
Thanks For Watching!

2
00:00:23,250 --> 00:00:25,220
In the end it's all about the counters.

3
00:00:32,130 --> 00:00:35,330
It doesn't matter who takes the offensive.

4
00:00:35,400 --> 00:00:36,730
That doesn't decide anything.

5
00:00:37,370 --> 00:00:39,700
That's why when the counter attack starts,
that's when it gets decided.

6
00:00:40,740 --> 00:00:43,370
All players decide whether they want to lead,

7
00:00:43,440 --> 00:00:45,240
or follow someone's lead.

8
00:00:45,310 --> 00:00:47,480
And if they do so,

9
00:00:48,040 --> 00:00:50,510
they can more or less get in control.

10
00:00:50,710 --> 00:00:53,450
I see! I see! I see!

11
00:00:55,220 --> 00:00:57,750
Seiji is laughing though!

12
00:00:58,420 --> 00:00:59,820
I'm always ready to go first,

13
00:00:59,890 --> 00:01:01,160
in that sort of mindset every time.

14
00:01:01,660 --> 00:01:04,590
I'm almost never actively defending myself.

15
00:01:04,660 --> 00:01:06,800
It's more like I want to at least survive.

16
00:01:06,860 --> 00:01:10,000
I started getting ready yesterday and was done this morning.

17
00:01:10,570 --> 00:01:12,840
So I'm sleep deprived.

18
00:01:13,670 --> 00:01:15,340
I'm a little worried about that,

19
00:01:15,400 --> 00:01:17,110
I might even fall asleep in the middle of it all.

20
00:02:34,320 --> 00:02:36,120
So Sheena Mikan says...

21
00:02:36,190 --> 00:02:37,720
"Wanna do a sixty-nine?"

22
00:02:42,120 --> 00:02:43,830
That's an orange for the Chihara brothers!

23
00:02:44,360 --> 00:02:45,790
This is bad.

24
00:02:46,430 --> 00:02:48,060
Wanna play a game?

25
00:02:51,170 --> 00:02:52,470
There's more?

26
00:02:52,540 --> 00:02:54,400
Yeah, sorry.

27
00:02:54,470 --> 00:02:56,740
I don't know how to use this controller.

28
00:02:57,270 --> 00:02:59,040
It's kind of hard to figure out.

29
00:02:59,540 --> 00:03:00,840
Keep it up!

30
00:03:06,480 --> 00:03:08,520
Go! Go!
Start! Start!

31
00:03:09,050 --> 00:03:10,590
That's the same thing!

32
00:03:11,290 --> 00:03:12,860
He did it!
Let's go!

33
00:03:12,920 --> 00:03:14,090
He did it.

34
00:03:23,800 --> 00:03:25,530
Well, it's just that everyone...

35
00:03:25,600 --> 00:03:28,100
You were all smiling somewhat.

36
00:03:29,640 --> 00:03:33,840
So that's a yellow for everyone.

37
00:03:34,510 --> 00:03:35,540
No way!

38
00:03:35,610 --> 00:03:36,810
That's a lot.

39
00:03:45,350 --> 00:03:47,060
Just... can you leave it for later?

40
00:03:47,120 --> 00:03:48,520
Leave it for later. Seriously.

41
00:03:48,590 --> 00:03:50,290
It'll be more effective later.

42
00:03:50,360 --> 00:03:53,030
Yeah, that was kind of a killer blow.

43
00:03:53,100 --> 00:03:54,400
Wait a minute.

44
00:03:54,460 --> 00:03:55,460
Here we go.

45
00:03:57,670 --> 00:03:58,700
Let's do it again.

46
00:03:58,770 --> 00:03:59,770
You want to keep going?

47
00:03:59,840 --> 00:04:00,940
I do.

48
00:04:01,000 --> 00:04:04,140
Wait, just...
Chance, take a look.

49
00:04:04,210 --> 00:04:05,270
Sorry, sorry.

50
00:04:05,340 --> 00:04:06,940
Yeah, that yellow thing...

51
00:04:07,210 --> 00:04:08,610
That's right, sorry, sorry.

52
00:04:09,780 --> 00:04:11,080
Okay, here we go.

53
00:04:14,620 --> 00:04:20,160
What's that below his head?
Is that a sock?

54
00:04:23,030 --> 00:04:23,530
See?

55
00:04:26,560 --> 00:04:28,230
That's the same mistake as before.

56
00:04:29,200 --> 00:04:30,870
Why does his face get all huge?

57
00:04:32,900 --> 00:04:33,900
This is just a mess!

58
00:04:33,970 --> 00:04:36,010
It's the same as before!

59
00:04:38,140 --> 00:04:41,240
You can't do the same thing.

60
00:04:42,680 --> 00:04:44,280
Ah, it's different. It's different!

61
00:04:44,350 --> 00:04:46,180
No, no, no.
That jump is impossible.

62
00:04:46,250 --> 00:04:47,780
— It's huge!
— Isn't it impossible?

63
00:04:47,850 --> 00:04:49,690
You can't make it!

64
00:04:51,250 --> 00:04:52,490
You can barely make it, probably.

65
00:04:53,520 --> 00:04:55,190
— No way, no way.
— It's too wide.

66
00:04:58,330 --> 00:05:00,230
That's genius.

67
00:05:00,300 --> 00:05:01,960
That's god's helping hand.

68
00:05:09,910 --> 00:05:11,710
— Who was it?
— It wasn't me.

69
00:05:11,840 --> 00:05:12,840
Not me.

70
00:05:14,180 --> 00:05:16,180
— It's really not me.
— Not me either.

71
00:05:16,250 --> 00:05:17,310
Not me.

72
00:05:17,380 --> 00:05:18,810
— Who was it?
— No way!

73
00:05:18,880 --> 00:05:20,680
So no one was it?

74
00:05:21,080 --> 00:05:22,150
I managed to hold it in.

75
00:05:22,220 --> 00:05:23,490
So did I.

76
00:05:23,550 --> 00:05:24,820
— You, Chance?
— No, I didn't smile.

77
00:05:24,890 --> 00:05:25,890
It opened.

78
00:05:27,360 --> 00:05:29,260
— I held it.
— Who was it then?

79
00:05:30,690 --> 00:05:35,360
So... It wasn't anyone.

80
00:05:35,430 --> 00:05:36,630
There it is!

81
00:05:36,700 --> 00:05:37,700
Again?

82
00:05:37,770 --> 00:05:39,840
It was funny, so I just came here.

83
00:05:41,200 --> 00:05:44,110
— It looked fun.
— Don't do that, man!

84
00:05:44,640 --> 00:05:46,410
It looked funny.

85
00:05:46,480 --> 00:05:48,010
I panicked back there!

86
00:05:48,080 --> 00:05:49,140
That scared me!

87
00:05:49,210 --> 00:05:51,550
I thought I would get sent off!

88
00:05:51,610 --> 00:05:53,250
Please don't do that!

89
00:05:53,320 --> 00:05:56,420
Isn't this game too deadly?

90
00:05:56,490 --> 00:06:00,320
We still have many stages,
so why don't you join us at least once, Matsumoto-san?

91
00:06:01,120 --> 00:06:03,090
No, no, no, no.

92
00:06:03,490 --> 00:06:05,830
Fine by me, but someone might end up losing.

93
00:06:05,890 --> 00:06:07,760
This is too much.

94
00:06:07,830 --> 00:06:09,700
It's really too much.

95
00:06:09,770 --> 00:06:12,430
But it's pretty fun, so why did you come here?

96
00:06:12,600 --> 00:06:13,740
Why did you come here?

97
00:06:13,800 --> 00:06:17,740
I just wanted to enter this world.

98
00:06:18,340 --> 00:06:20,080
Are we little kids or something?

99
00:06:20,280 --> 00:06:22,380
But you were all smiling just a little.

100
00:06:22,440 --> 00:06:23,450
It can't be helped, though.

101
00:06:23,510 --> 00:06:27,020
You weren't laughing out loud, so I've decided you're all safe.

102
00:06:27,080 --> 00:06:28,650
I really wanted to laugh so bad.

103
00:06:28,720 --> 00:06:31,290
I wanted to laugh too bad, for real.

104
00:06:31,350 --> 00:06:33,090
I know, I know.

105
00:06:33,320 --> 00:06:35,860
This is really fucking stressful!

106
00:06:35,920 --> 00:06:37,130
Just give us a break already!

107
00:06:37,190 --> 00:06:38,230
It can't be helped though.

108
00:06:38,360 --> 00:06:40,000
— Are we gonna keep going?
— Please no more.

109
00:06:40,060 --> 00:06:41,400
I'm scared.

110
00:06:42,460 --> 00:06:44,630
— There's more?
— Wait a second.

111
00:06:44,700 --> 00:06:46,740
This is rough.

112
00:06:46,800 --> 00:06:47,800
Wait a couple more hours.

113
00:06:48,000 --> 00:06:50,070
Do it after I come back from the bathroom.

114
00:06:50,140 --> 00:06:51,170
I'm going to the bathroom.

115
00:06:51,240 --> 00:06:53,140
Once we try a few other things in a couple hours maybe.

116
00:06:53,210 --> 00:06:56,410
But we might not have much concentration by then.

117
00:06:56,480 --> 00:06:57,580
Here we go.

118
00:07:02,420 --> 00:07:03,720
He's puking.

119
00:07:10,660 --> 00:07:12,330
Please stop this, man.

120
00:07:12,390 --> 00:07:13,400
Right?

121
00:07:13,460 --> 00:07:15,130
— Why did he eat so much?
— How many bowls did he eat?

122
00:07:15,200 --> 00:07:16,900
— Eight.
— Eight?!

123
00:07:16,970 --> 00:07:19,900
And he didn't even use any condiments or anything.

124
00:07:22,040 --> 00:07:23,270
None at all.

125
00:07:23,340 --> 00:07:24,540
I saw him use some, just a little.

126
00:07:24,610 --> 00:07:26,010
Ah, really?

127
00:07:26,070 --> 00:07:27,610
We're almost at 1:30 hours,
and there's a Hummer right there.

128
00:07:28,340 --> 00:07:30,350
— Whose is it?
— Hide-san's?

129
00:07:30,480 --> 00:07:32,920
I want you to see a reaction.

130
00:07:34,220 --> 00:07:35,320
He's annoying.

131
00:07:35,820 --> 00:07:37,250
It's just...

132
00:07:37,620 --> 00:07:39,250
That's why we told him not to eat so many.

133
00:07:39,320 --> 00:07:40,860
He didn't have to eat them.

134
00:07:40,920 --> 00:07:44,460
There are six bowls here.

135
00:07:45,160 --> 00:07:47,600
So he's going to keep going after puking?

136
00:07:47,660 --> 00:07:49,160
He's a real monster.

137
00:07:49,230 --> 00:07:51,030
Okay, ready?
The reactions goes like...

138
00:07:51,100 --> 00:07:52,900
You press it here once.

139
00:07:52,970 --> 00:07:54,040
— Okay!

140
00:07:54,100 --> 00:07:55,270
I think he kind of gets it!

141
00:07:55,340 --> 00:07:57,170
Yeah, well... I guess so, yeah.

142
00:07:57,740 --> 00:07:59,310
So you're doing it yourself?

143
00:07:59,370 --> 00:08:01,340
It doesn't have to be me, though.

144
00:08:01,410 --> 00:08:03,410
No, no, I meant the controller.

145
00:08:03,810 --> 00:08:06,280
Can I leave that to someone else?

146
00:08:06,350 --> 00:08:07,580
— Should I do it?
— Sure.

147
00:08:07,650 --> 00:08:09,450
It's better if someone else does it.

148
00:08:09,520 --> 00:08:11,550
— You okay?
— Yeah, I'm okay.

149
00:08:11,620 --> 00:08:13,220
Stop it already.

150
00:08:13,820 --> 00:08:15,820
Fujita, stop it, man.

151
00:08:15,890 --> 00:08:17,760
— But I'm hungry.
— You were puking.

152
00:08:17,830 --> 00:08:18,260
— But it's out already.

153
00:08:18,260 --> 00:08:20,230
— You forced it out.
— But it's out already.

154
00:08:20,300 --> 00:08:22,160
— No, it just came out.
— Don't force yourself to eat.

155
00:08:24,930 --> 00:08:28,400
Besides, remember Amazon is looking at us from abroad.

156
00:08:28,470 --> 00:08:29,470
I see.

157
00:08:29,540 --> 00:08:30,940
— I get it now.
— That's right, that's right...!

158
00:08:31,010 --> 00:08:33,380
This reaction will be broadcast in hundreds of countries.

159
00:08:35,380 --> 00:08:37,050
That's fast.

160
00:08:37,110 --> 00:08:38,550
Wait till it gets there.

161
00:08:38,910 --> 00:08:40,380
It's not there yet.

162
00:08:40,450 --> 00:08:42,420
Not everything is there yet.

163
00:08:43,150 --> 00:08:45,120
It's best if you tell us you're ready.

164
00:08:45,190 --> 00:08:46,420
"Okay, ready" or something.

165
00:08:46,490 --> 00:08:48,120
When it's done.

166
00:08:49,060 --> 00:08:50,060
Ouch!

167
00:08:54,700 --> 00:08:56,530
He's tying them.

168
00:08:56,600 --> 00:08:58,400
Ah, he's pinching himself!

169
00:08:58,700 --> 00:09:00,770
Is right here okay?

170
00:09:07,610 --> 00:09:09,280
Okay?

171
00:09:11,310 --> 00:09:12,850
Using all of them at the same time is better.
Like this.

172
00:09:12,920 --> 00:09:15,280
That's right.
Wait, that one fell.

173
00:09:17,220 --> 00:09:19,250
— Doesn't it hurt?
— It hurts, it hurts.

174
00:09:20,090 --> 00:09:22,320
I got it on this one.
I can't get it on this one.

175
00:09:22,390 --> 00:09:23,590
This one.

176
00:09:23,660 --> 00:09:25,730
That's enough! That looks painful.

177
00:09:26,190 --> 00:09:27,760
"It looks painful"?

178
00:09:29,530 --> 00:09:31,830
It can't be helped, that's just how he is.

179
00:09:32,070 --> 00:09:33,440
Are you okay?

180
00:09:33,640 --> 00:09:35,200
That's a lot of them.

181
00:09:35,900 --> 00:09:37,540
Ouch, ouch, ouch!

182
00:09:37,610 --> 00:09:39,710
Wasn't there someone like this abroad?

183
00:09:39,910 --> 00:09:42,010
I feel like there's a popular image like this somewhere.

184
00:09:43,350 --> 00:09:44,710
Okay!

185
00:09:56,060 --> 00:09:57,060
Junior.

186
00:09:59,630 --> 00:10:02,260
— Do it.
— Ah that's Junior-san's job, right?

187
00:10:06,200 --> 00:10:08,440
— Junior, it's the other way.
— Go ahead.

188
00:10:08,500 --> 00:10:10,140
That doesn't hurt, though.

189
00:10:10,210 --> 00:10:11,440
It's in reverse.

190
00:10:18,550 --> 00:10:20,580
— Is that all it has?
— That's weak.

191
00:10:20,750 --> 00:10:22,020
Pretty weak.

192
00:10:22,080 --> 00:10:23,290
It's the tires...

193
00:10:23,350 --> 00:10:24,890
They're not moving forward at all.

194
00:10:25,150 --> 00:10:26,860
The tires are just...

195
00:10:26,920 --> 00:10:28,290
They're stuck, they're stuck.

196
00:10:28,760 --> 00:10:30,130
Wouldn't it be better to put something below it?

197
00:10:30,190 --> 00:10:31,330
It's just sliding in place.

198
00:10:31,960 --> 00:10:33,660
The tires shouldn't spin there like that.

199
00:10:33,730 --> 00:10:35,300
Wanna throw something in there?

200
00:10:35,360 --> 00:10:36,370
Are we gonna do it?

201
00:10:36,830 --> 00:10:39,470
Hey, don't put that there.
I'm still eating it.

202
00:10:39,470 --> 00:10:40,870
That's my ginger.

203
00:10:40,940 --> 00:10:41,940
Look, Kawamoto.

204
00:10:42,000 --> 00:10:43,010
Ginger's not going to work.

205
00:10:43,070 --> 00:10:44,740
I just said that I was still eating it!

206
00:10:44,810 --> 00:10:46,310
It's to stop it from sliding.

207
00:10:46,380 --> 00:10:48,280
Ah, I get it.

208
00:10:48,340 --> 00:10:49,780
I see.
That might work.

209
00:10:49,850 --> 00:10:51,050
I'm still eating that.

210
00:10:51,110 --> 00:10:52,310
You're spreading it the wrong way.

211
00:10:52,380 --> 00:10:53,580
Maybe mustard would've been better?

212
00:10:53,650 --> 00:10:55,120
— Ouch, ouch!
— Throw in some with the ginger.

213
00:10:55,180 --> 00:10:56,220
Maybe a leek would've worked better.

214
00:10:56,280 --> 00:10:57,290
It would've been the same.

215
00:10:57,350 --> 00:10:59,220
We just need some moisture to prevent it from slipping.

216
00:10:59,290 --> 00:11:00,890
A leek would've been worse, Kawamoto.

217
00:11:02,120 --> 00:11:03,330
Ready? In that case...

218
00:11:04,090 --> 00:11:05,590
That looks good.

219
00:11:05,660 --> 00:11:06,960
It looks delicious.

220
00:11:07,030 --> 00:11:08,860
It looks awful, though.

221
00:11:08,930 --> 00:11:10,900
— Ready?
— "Dat's Tephanyaki!"

222
00:11:10,970 --> 00:11:12,270
What's "tephan"?

223
00:11:13,370 --> 00:11:14,370
Ready?

224
00:11:14,440 --> 00:11:16,070
Aren't you waiting too much?

225
00:11:16,470 --> 00:11:17,670
Give us a signal.

226
00:11:17,740 --> 00:11:18,970
Do it.

227
00:11:22,980 --> 00:11:24,580
That was the signal.

228
00:11:25,380 --> 00:11:26,780
No, Koba.

229
00:11:28,220 --> 00:11:29,220
Go ahead.

230
00:11:29,750 --> 00:11:31,050
Just...

231
00:11:32,020 --> 00:11:33,460
— You know the controls?
— I don't.

232
00:11:33,520 --> 00:11:35,120
Then don't use it!

233
00:11:35,320 --> 00:11:36,890
It's really easy!

234
00:11:37,630 --> 00:11:39,800
I mean, I played with stuff like this a lot when I was little.

235
00:11:39,860 --> 00:11:41,060
That's your generation, right.

236
00:11:41,130 --> 00:11:42,800
I'm sure people your age did a lot.

237
00:11:42,860 --> 00:11:44,530
It's a really simple controller.

238
00:11:44,600 --> 00:11:46,570
It's easy to understand...

239
00:11:46,770 --> 00:11:47,770
That's forward.

240
00:11:47,840 --> 00:11:49,400
Give us the signal when you're ready.

241
00:11:49,810 --> 00:11:51,310
Okay, go!

242
00:11:54,840 --> 00:11:55,880
Let's go Fujimoto-san.

243
00:11:55,940 --> 00:11:56,950
Hurry.

244
00:11:57,150 --> 00:11:58,150
Go forward.

245
00:11:59,450 --> 00:12:00,880
What are you doing?
Go! Go!

246
00:12:00,950 --> 00:12:03,250
— Go, go, go, go!
— Hummer go

247
00:12:03,390 --> 00:12:05,450
Go, Hummer, go.

248
00:12:05,550 --> 00:12:06,890
Come on, let's go.

249
00:12:06,960 --> 00:12:08,560
— There it is.
— It's just turning to the side.

250
00:12:08,620 --> 00:12:09,990
Time to go, let's go.

251
00:12:10,130 --> 00:12:11,390
Go forward, go forward.

252
00:12:11,460 --> 00:12:13,060
No, no, not like that.

253
00:12:13,130 --> 00:12:15,400
You just have to go straight ahead towards the camera.

254
00:12:15,460 --> 00:12:16,470
— Go!
— You just have to—

255
00:12:16,530 --> 00:12:17,530
Go! Please!

256
00:12:17,600 --> 00:12:19,200
— I don't get this.
— Go!

257
00:12:22,740 --> 00:12:23,740
Go!

258
00:12:28,380 --> 00:12:29,380
Go...

259
00:12:29,910 --> 00:12:31,680
— What?
— What kind of game is this anyways?

260
00:12:31,750 --> 00:12:33,550
What the hell are you doing? What do you want to do?

261
00:12:33,680 --> 00:12:36,950
Just move it forward.
And then we can get the reaction.

262
00:12:37,020 --> 00:12:38,450
Do it yourself.

263
00:12:40,060 --> 00:12:41,660
— It can't be helped.
— I don't get this.

264
00:12:41,660 --> 00:12:43,860
— It's our first time.
— You just had to drive forward with the signal.

265
00:12:44,860 --> 00:12:45,860
— Do it yourself...
— Just say go.

266
00:12:45,930 --> 00:12:47,060
Say "Go" yourself.

267
00:12:47,200 --> 00:12:48,330
Go!

268
00:13:06,820 --> 00:13:08,680
It's not enough. It's not enough at all.

269
00:13:09,120 --> 00:13:11,590
— It needs more horsepower.
— Something's not enough.

270
00:13:11,650 --> 00:13:13,790
It's not moving at all.
Doesn't seem to be 4x4.

271
00:13:14,120 --> 00:13:15,120
It's not enough, yeah.

272
00:13:15,190 --> 00:13:16,490
It might work on the floor.

273
00:13:18,690 --> 00:13:20,230
It's slipping.

274
00:13:20,300 --> 00:13:22,060
Stop, stop, stop, stop!

275
00:13:22,560 --> 00:13:24,800
Something's just not working.

276
00:13:25,430 --> 00:13:27,070
It doesn't have enough power.

277
00:13:27,140 --> 00:13:28,670
— Sorry, it's just not...
— Even though it's supposed to be a Hummer.

278
00:13:28,740 --> 00:13:30,070
It's supposed to be super powerful, though.

279
00:13:30,140 --> 00:13:31,910
Yeah, but it's just not enough.

280
00:13:32,340 --> 00:13:35,010
It's not meant to take this long though.

281
00:13:35,080 --> 00:13:36,410
It's just weaker than expected.

282
00:13:37,710 --> 00:13:39,850
Can someone else do it when it's down here?

283
00:13:41,550 --> 00:13:42,820
Sure?

284
00:13:45,120 --> 00:13:46,660
This is just...

285
00:13:48,390 --> 00:13:50,360
Oshiro-san, get a little closer.

286
00:13:50,430 --> 00:13:51,960
I just wanted this to pull on the clips,

287
00:13:52,030 --> 00:13:55,360
have it hurt like hell and then get it over with.

288
00:13:55,430 --> 00:13:57,130
Are you sure that's going to work?

289
00:13:58,330 --> 00:14:00,300
Not even a Hummer could do this, though.

290
00:14:00,370 --> 00:14:03,240
Do you guys have anything in mind?

291
00:14:04,570 --> 00:14:07,080
For the meantime?

292
00:14:08,510 --> 00:14:11,280
Well... this isn't recent, but...

293
00:14:11,780 --> 00:14:17,490
This is the story from the first time I went to a brothel.

294
00:14:18,950 --> 00:14:20,590
— You gonna tell that?
— In the meantime?

295
00:14:20,660 --> 00:14:22,020
— Are you sure?
— It's not recent, though.

296
00:14:22,090 --> 00:14:24,530
I was like 19.

297
00:14:24,590 --> 00:14:26,760
It's from a long time ago, then.

298
00:14:26,830 --> 00:14:28,360
That's right, that's right.

299
00:14:28,860 --> 00:14:30,070
It was a brothel in Kawasaki.

300
00:14:30,130 --> 00:14:31,370
Ah, in Kawasaki.

301
00:14:35,600 --> 00:14:38,370
It was my first time, so I was like...

302
00:14:42,510 --> 00:14:43,980
So I wanted to touch the girl, right?

303
00:14:45,310 --> 00:14:49,580
Right, so... we entered the bathroom,

304
00:14:51,150 --> 00:14:52,150
and I was going to touch her.

305
00:14:52,220 --> 00:14:53,620
— Right there?

306
00:14:53,890 --> 00:14:57,530
I thought it would be fine.

307
00:14:57,590 --> 00:14:59,660
— That's annoying.
— That noise...

308
00:15:01,630 --> 00:15:02,930
Is something triggering it?

309
00:15:03,000 --> 00:15:04,370
I think it's the other way around.

310
00:15:04,430 --> 00:15:05,430
Like the trigger is...

311
00:15:05,500 --> 00:15:08,170
No, I mean, I think the original conversation is getting in the way right now.

312
00:15:08,470 --> 00:15:09,940
This is the main event right now.

313
00:15:10,010 --> 00:15:11,510
Junior-san is the main event.

314
00:15:11,740 --> 00:15:13,740
So you tried to touch her?

315
00:15:13,810 --> 00:15:17,050
I tried to touch her, and she slapped my hand,

316
00:15:17,780 --> 00:15:18,780
and said "no way."

317
00:15:19,950 --> 00:15:21,480
"Don't take the hand—"

318
00:15:23,020 --> 00:15:25,020
I'm getting distracted.

319
00:15:25,090 --> 00:15:27,290
It's an annoying sound.

320
00:15:27,360 --> 00:15:28,490
So "no way"?

321
00:15:28,560 --> 00:15:32,630
"Why are you touching me with your hands without washing them first?"

322
00:15:33,190 --> 00:15:35,730
— She got really mad.
— That's just the etiquette.

323
00:15:35,800 --> 00:15:36,870
It was the first time they told me I had to do it—

324
00:15:36,870 --> 00:15:38,070
You didn't know since it was your first time.

325
00:15:38,070 --> 00:15:39,870
That's what happens if you touch her out of nowhere.

326
00:15:39,870 --> 00:15:41,100
It can't be helped.

327
00:15:42,740 --> 00:15:46,740
So I washed my hands, and they were now clean.

328
00:15:48,040 --> 00:15:49,380
Now I wondered if I could touch—

329
00:15:52,650 --> 00:15:54,820
So you get it going when he raises his hand?

330
00:15:54,880 --> 00:15:55,950
Maybe.

331
00:15:56,020 --> 00:15:57,790
Every time he puts up his hands.

332
00:15:57,950 --> 00:15:58,950
That's the trigger?

333
00:15:59,020 --> 00:16:00,360
Maybe.

334
00:16:00,920 --> 00:16:02,320
So she says "no way."

335
00:16:02,390 --> 00:16:04,190
Ah, I knew it.

336
00:16:04,260 --> 00:16:05,560
With the hand, yeah.

337
00:16:05,830 --> 00:16:06,930
That's right.

338
00:16:07,460 --> 00:16:10,130
Try speaking without doing that.
Try it.

339
00:16:11,530 --> 00:16:14,200
Speak up normally without raising your hand.

340
00:16:14,270 --> 00:16:15,940
Without raising my hand, right?

341
00:16:16,000 --> 00:16:17,370
Just stay right there.

342
00:16:17,610 --> 00:16:20,880
And so she says "no way!"

343
00:16:21,640 --> 00:16:24,980
"You have to wash your entire body,"

344
00:16:25,050 --> 00:16:27,080
"and touch me on the bed."

345
00:16:27,780 --> 00:16:28,780
So she went to bed.

346
00:16:28,850 --> 00:16:29,850
See?

347
00:16:30,590 --> 00:16:32,050
We've confirmed it.

348
00:16:32,720 --> 00:16:33,860
I guess that's it then.

349
00:16:34,990 --> 00:16:37,030
Lower your hand and keep talking.

350
00:16:37,660 --> 00:16:38,830
Just do it.

351
00:16:42,860 --> 00:16:43,870
Like this?

352
00:16:43,930 --> 00:16:44,970
Right.

353
00:16:45,430 --> 00:16:48,200
Yeah, yeah. Try talking now.

354
00:16:48,600 --> 00:16:51,770
So I washed myself thoroughly and went to bed.

355
00:16:52,140 --> 00:16:54,610
And I was thinking she'd let me touch her now.

356
00:16:56,440 --> 00:16:58,080
So I tried touching her—

357
00:16:58,580 --> 00:17:00,180
Huh?

358
00:17:00,250 --> 00:17:01,820
— Didn't you just smile?
— I didn't.

359
00:17:04,150 --> 00:17:05,150
You definitely did.

360
00:17:06,860 --> 00:17:07,860
He did it himself.

361
00:17:07,920 --> 00:17:09,360
He sure did!

362
00:17:09,420 --> 00:17:11,290
He self destructed!

363
00:17:11,560 --> 00:17:13,500
Wait, you self destructed!

364
00:17:14,160 --> 00:17:15,460
You definitely smiled!

365
00:17:15,530 --> 00:17:16,800
He was smiling a lot!

366
00:17:16,870 --> 00:17:18,970
No, that's just how the story goes, you know?

367
00:17:19,030 --> 00:17:20,140
That's normal.

368
00:17:20,200 --> 00:17:21,900
Yeah, but you can't do that either.

369
00:17:22,670 --> 00:17:24,370
It's not "just normal".

370
00:17:24,940 --> 00:17:25,970
There he is.

371
00:17:26,040 --> 00:17:27,310
He was smiling, right?

372
00:17:28,310 --> 00:17:31,550
But that was just how the story...
you know.

373
00:17:31,850 --> 00:17:33,520
What a liar.

374
00:17:33,920 --> 00:17:35,080
I can't do this either?

375
00:17:35,150 --> 00:17:37,190
You were smiling knowingly.

376
00:17:37,390 --> 00:17:41,960
You should've pressed the switch yourself.

377
00:17:42,020 --> 00:17:43,990
Having junior press it was...

378
00:17:44,390 --> 00:17:45,560
it's pretty much suicide.

379
00:17:46,060 --> 00:17:50,400
Besides, you were smiling pretty obviously back there, even with all those clips!

380
00:17:50,870 --> 00:17:52,070
For real.

381
00:17:52,200 --> 00:17:53,400
I don't know for sure.

382
00:17:53,470 --> 00:17:54,840
Why don't we take a look?

383
00:17:54,900 --> 00:17:57,010
He was smiling for sure!

384
00:17:57,740 --> 00:18:00,810
So I washed myself thoroughly and I went to bed,

385
00:18:01,280 --> 00:18:03,480
and I was thinking that I'd be able to touch her.

386
00:18:05,610 --> 00:18:07,150
So I tried touching her—

387
00:18:08,480 --> 00:18:09,920
He's obviously smiling!

388
00:18:10,080 --> 00:18:11,520
He's smiling a lot!

389
00:18:13,490 --> 00:18:15,120
Even though it wasn't funny at all!

390
00:18:15,320 --> 00:18:16,930
What the hell was I thinking?

391
00:18:17,760 --> 00:18:21,700
The story wasn't funny at all!

392
00:18:21,760 --> 00:18:23,130
Just what was I thinking?

393
00:18:23,130 --> 00:18:24,600
Even though you couldn't really see his face,

394
00:18:24,600 --> 00:18:26,030
you could just tell.

395
00:18:26,630 --> 00:18:27,770
This has to be a red!

396
00:18:28,100 --> 00:18:29,640
Wait a second!

397
00:18:29,700 --> 00:18:31,010
Wait, wait, wait...

398
00:18:32,640 --> 00:18:33,640
Okay, so...

399
00:18:33,710 --> 00:18:35,240
What was the story about in the end?

400
00:18:36,810 --> 00:18:38,550
I can't take these off.

401
00:18:39,750 --> 00:18:42,020
That's your own fault!

402
00:18:43,420 --> 00:18:45,690
You should've practiced at home.

403
00:18:45,750 --> 00:18:46,920
Practiced?

404
00:18:47,460 --> 00:18:48,560
Of course you should've!

405
00:18:48,620 --> 00:18:49,990
I should've practiced this stuff?

406
00:18:50,090 --> 00:18:51,260
Of course!

407
00:18:51,330 --> 00:18:52,990
At least check its power!

408
00:18:53,560 --> 00:18:55,130
At least check if it was enough.

409
00:18:55,500 --> 00:18:57,770
Or stand on the chair and drop it from there.

410
00:18:58,100 --> 00:19:00,240
One time was...

411
00:19:00,300 --> 00:19:03,070
It might've been clean and funny.

412
00:19:03,140 --> 00:19:05,140
Especially without knowing your expression.

413
00:19:05,210 --> 00:19:06,470
Just once...

414
00:19:06,540 --> 00:19:07,880
Okay, take them off.

415
00:19:08,010 --> 00:19:09,140
Try to be gentle.

416
00:19:09,210 --> 00:19:10,510
This is a bother.

417
00:19:10,680 --> 00:19:14,020
There's no point if you go that far and don't know what to do.

418
00:19:14,080 --> 00:19:16,250
You should've ran a simulation.

419
00:19:16,320 --> 00:19:17,350
That's right!

420
00:19:17,520 --> 00:19:20,590
These are full of drool, man!

421
00:19:21,020 --> 00:19:22,320
Do this before getting revived.

422
00:19:22,390 --> 00:19:24,230
The drool's just...

423
00:19:24,290 --> 00:19:25,690
These are so slippery!

424
00:19:25,760 --> 00:19:28,460
It couldn't be helped!
They were there for a long time!

425
00:19:29,300 --> 00:19:31,870
And he had his mouth wide open.
They're full of drool.

426
00:19:33,500 --> 00:19:34,500
That's right.

427
00:19:34,570 --> 00:19:35,700
Thanks, bro.

428
00:19:35,970 --> 00:19:37,510
What bro?

429
00:19:38,040 --> 00:19:39,410
Don't call me bro.

430
00:19:39,540 --> 00:19:40,940
Bro. Bro.

431
00:19:41,280 --> 00:19:43,780
No, no, I'm more like your dad.

432
00:19:44,580 --> 00:19:46,380
Isn't Shinsuke the dad?

433
00:19:46,450 --> 00:19:48,320
That's how Misono calls him.

434
00:19:48,380 --> 00:19:49,380
That's how Misono calls him.

435
00:19:49,650 --> 00:19:51,690
You drool far too much!

436
00:19:51,950 --> 00:19:53,590
Sorry, bro.

437
00:19:54,460 --> 00:19:55,460
Don't call me bro.

438
00:19:55,520 --> 00:19:57,960
Stop it with all that Hexagon family Fujimon nonsense. (Editor's Note 1 - Check out the Patreon for in-depth explanations)

439
00:19:58,230 --> 00:19:59,230
The family's not active anymore.

440
00:19:59,290 --> 00:20:00,560
And they used to get along so well, too.

441
00:20:00,930 --> 00:20:02,030
The family's not...?

442
00:20:02,100 --> 00:20:03,530
What do you mean they're not active anymore?

443
00:20:03,600 --> 00:20:05,300
So they don't call themselves that anymore?

444
00:20:05,830 --> 00:20:07,170
I guess so.

445
00:20:07,640 --> 00:20:08,640
But they got along really well!

446
00:20:08,700 --> 00:20:10,670
Wait, what family are you talking about here?

447
00:20:10,740 --> 00:20:12,140
The Hexagon family.

448
00:20:12,210 --> 00:20:13,240
They don't do it anymore.

449
00:20:13,310 --> 00:20:16,110
So the entire family dissolves without the wife? (EN: 2)

450
00:20:17,510 --> 00:20:19,210
Stop it. It's getting dark.

451
00:20:26,350 --> 00:20:29,090
Give me a second,
there's something I want to practice.

452
00:20:29,160 --> 00:20:30,990
— Sure. Go ahead.
— Is it okay?

453
00:20:31,460 --> 00:20:32,890
Can you help me out?

454
00:20:33,160 --> 00:20:34,760
Let's do it.

455
00:20:35,860 --> 00:20:39,330
Anyone here have a good swing?
A bat swing.

456
00:20:39,770 --> 00:20:41,470
— I'm not great.
— Not at all.

457
00:20:41,540 --> 00:20:42,870
I used to play baseball.

458
00:20:42,940 --> 00:20:44,670
Shouji?

459
00:20:45,510 --> 00:20:47,010
Wait...

460
00:20:49,580 --> 00:20:50,850
A swing?

461
00:20:51,110 --> 00:20:52,280
Is this an experiment?

462
00:20:52,580 --> 00:20:56,050
Not really an experiment but...
More like practice.

463
00:20:56,320 --> 00:20:58,450
See, I can cut the nerves in my ass.

464
00:20:58,520 --> 00:21:00,190
My lower body in general.

465
00:21:00,890 --> 00:21:02,620
— What do you mean by "cut"?
— Like it doesn't feel much pain.

466
00:21:02,690 --> 00:21:04,260
Can you get rid of pain altogether?

467
00:21:04,730 --> 00:21:06,060
So it's like a paralysis?

468
00:21:06,760 --> 00:21:09,000
So I've barely managed to do this by myself.

469
00:21:09,460 --> 00:21:11,800
And I think I'm starting to get better.

470
00:21:11,930 --> 00:21:14,240
So can I ask you to take a test swing?

471
00:21:15,840 --> 00:21:18,040
You just have to swing at least once.

472
00:21:18,310 --> 00:21:19,570
What are you going to do?

473
00:21:21,880 --> 00:21:25,710
That's it, that's it.
It's great like that.

474
00:21:25,850 --> 00:21:27,080
That's pretty intense.

475
00:21:27,150 --> 00:21:28,620
What if you do it facing that way?

476
00:21:28,680 --> 00:21:29,680
Yeah, this way.

477
00:21:29,750 --> 00:21:31,820
If he's right handed.

478
00:21:31,890 --> 00:21:32,950
— Are you gonna do that?
— Are you sure?

479
00:21:33,020 --> 00:21:36,390
Wait a second.
Until my nerves are numb.

480
00:21:39,260 --> 00:21:40,260
Are you sure I can do it hard?

481
00:21:40,330 --> 00:21:43,300
Make sure you do it as hard as you can.

482
00:21:43,770 --> 00:21:47,040
— I'm gonna do it for real.
— Yeah, choose a good place.

483
00:21:47,100 --> 00:21:49,000
Around here?

484
00:21:49,370 --> 00:21:50,710
Here I go.

485
00:21:50,770 --> 00:21:52,370
Wait a second. They're not fully numb yet.

486
00:21:53,470 --> 00:21:54,880
So that's how you do it?

487
00:21:56,780 --> 00:21:58,410
So he's blocking his pain receptors?

488
00:21:58,480 --> 00:21:59,780
What's he doing?

489
00:21:59,850 --> 00:22:01,680
Is he stopping his nervous system?

490
00:22:01,750 --> 00:22:03,080
What's he doing?

491
00:22:03,150 --> 00:22:04,190
Wait, not— not yet, not yet.

492
00:22:04,250 --> 00:22:05,790
It still hurts!

493
00:22:05,850 --> 00:22:07,620
— Ouch!
— What are you doing?

494
00:22:07,690 --> 00:22:08,960
You didn't wait at all!

495
00:22:09,020 --> 00:22:10,590
I was just in the middle of it!

496
00:22:10,660 --> 00:22:11,930
Do it after that!

497
00:22:13,090 --> 00:22:14,530
— Is your ass numb right now?
— I guess, kind of.

498
00:22:14,600 --> 00:22:15,900
You wanna go?

499
00:22:15,960 --> 00:22:17,500
Ready? It's one strike.

500
00:22:17,570 --> 00:22:19,100
Are you sure?

501
00:22:19,970 --> 00:22:21,240
Are you really sure?

502
00:22:21,300 --> 00:22:22,300
Yeah, since my ass is numb anyways.

503
00:22:28,280 --> 00:22:30,650
— It's numb?
— Fucking hell!!!

504
00:22:31,010 --> 00:22:32,450
— He's really pissed off.

505
00:22:32,510 --> 00:22:34,820
Fucking hell! Fuck you!!

506
00:22:35,180 --> 00:22:36,450
— That's a bad pun.
— He's pissed off.

507
00:22:36,520 --> 00:22:41,220
Fuck fuck!! Don't get pissed off!!

508
00:22:41,760 --> 00:22:42,760
He's pissed off.

509
00:22:42,820 --> 00:22:43,860
I'm not pissed off at all.

510
00:22:43,930 --> 00:22:45,130
Sometimes...

511
00:22:45,190 --> 00:22:48,700
Sometimes it's okay to have a little fun.

512
00:22:48,760 --> 00:22:49,800
What was that?

513
00:22:49,860 --> 00:22:52,470
So after they destroyed his ass with the bat,

514
00:22:52,470 --> 00:22:55,470
he said his ass was numb,
and that's pronounced the same as being "pissed off" in Japanese.

515
00:22:55,470 --> 00:22:56,970
So that's what you were talking about?

516
00:22:58,010 --> 00:23:03,310
It's a pun with his ass being numb and him being pissed off.

517
00:23:03,380 --> 00:23:04,380
I wasn't pissed off, though.

518
00:23:04,450 --> 00:23:06,150
I don't wear Gucci clothes either.
I wasn't affected at all.

519
00:23:06,210 --> 00:23:07,380
So you just do that sometimes?

520
00:23:07,450 --> 00:23:09,380
I don't do shit that stupid.

521
00:23:10,950 --> 00:23:13,720
But I know this guy wears Gucci for stupid things like T-shirts and stuff like that.

522
00:23:13,790 --> 00:23:14,790
Right?

523
00:23:15,020 --> 00:23:18,490
Not at all. I don't buy Gucci T-shirts.

524
00:23:18,590 --> 00:23:21,400
You do that? I guess it's just because you have this

525
00:23:21,460 --> 00:23:23,630
kind of crazy approach to life in general, huh?

526
00:23:24,600 --> 00:23:27,000
I mean, you can interpret it like that if you want to.

527
00:23:27,070 --> 00:23:29,600
One of the cute things about him is how easily embarrassed he gets, though.

528
00:23:29,670 --> 00:23:30,840
Yeah, that's true.

529
00:23:31,210 --> 00:23:32,610
But he's also more experienced than any of us.

530
00:23:32,670 --> 00:23:34,280
Thank you Koba-san.

531
00:23:34,480 --> 00:23:36,210
Come on, leave me alone.

532
00:23:36,810 --> 00:23:38,680
Picasso was also kind of weird.

533
00:23:38,750 --> 00:23:39,780
Come on, just...

534
00:23:39,850 --> 00:23:41,350
— You're a genius!
— Are you numb?

535
00:23:41,420 --> 00:23:42,420
I'm numb.

536
00:23:42,480 --> 00:23:44,090
Why do you just thank Koba?

537
00:23:44,220 --> 00:23:45,620
Wait a minute.
Yeah, it's fully numb.

538
00:23:45,690 --> 00:23:46,690
Are you numb?

539
00:23:50,420 --> 00:23:51,430
That's sad.

540
00:23:55,060 --> 00:23:56,660
That's sad.

541
00:23:56,760 --> 00:23:58,000
That strike was just...

542
00:24:00,430 --> 00:24:02,440
I thought my grandma had bumped into me.

543
00:24:02,500 --> 00:24:05,140
Like when she was walking behind me.

544
00:24:05,210 --> 00:24:06,470
That's about how much it hurt.

545
00:24:06,540 --> 00:24:08,540
A silver car?

546
00:24:08,540 --> 00:24:10,110
One of those electric silver car things.

547
00:24:10,110 --> 00:24:11,580
Electric?

548
00:24:11,650 --> 00:24:13,110
I didn't know they were electric!

549
00:24:14,580 --> 00:24:15,820
Yeah, I guess.

550
00:24:15,880 --> 00:24:20,790
I thought those weren't electric.

551
00:24:20,860 --> 00:24:22,360
I didn't expect that at all.

552
00:24:22,420 --> 00:24:24,860
When your grandma bumps into you,

553
00:24:24,930 --> 00:24:26,830
it hurts... it hurts about this much.

554
00:24:29,930 --> 00:24:31,800
So it was like a grandma, then.

555
00:24:31,930 --> 00:24:34,640
Try doing it one more time.

556
00:24:34,700 --> 00:24:36,240
How? How hard?

557
00:24:36,300 --> 00:24:38,340
A grandma hurts about this much, right?

558
00:24:38,410 --> 00:24:41,580
And an electric cart hurts about that much.

559
00:24:50,650 --> 00:24:53,390
I wasn't smiling! I was holding it in!

560
00:24:54,090 --> 00:24:55,890
You've been struggling for a while!

561
00:24:55,960 --> 00:24:56,990
I was holding it!

562
00:24:57,060 --> 00:24:58,360
You were smiling!

563
00:24:59,430 --> 00:25:01,060
It was pretty close.

564
00:25:01,760 --> 00:25:03,460
I held it!

565
00:25:03,530 --> 00:25:04,870
You couldn't do it!

566
00:25:06,000 --> 00:25:07,000
Eh?!

567
00:25:07,070 --> 00:25:08,270
You were smiling the whole time.

568
00:25:08,340 --> 00:25:09,540
All the time!

569
00:25:09,600 --> 00:25:10,610
He was smiling all the time.

570
00:25:10,710 --> 00:25:11,840
He was smiling all along.

571
00:25:11,910 --> 00:25:13,170
I held it in!

572
00:25:13,240 --> 00:25:14,240
You were smiling.

573
00:25:14,480 --> 00:25:16,840
No way anymore!

574
00:25:16,910 --> 00:25:18,410
I guess this means...

575
00:25:19,350 --> 00:25:20,820
Well, let's just take a look.

576
00:25:21,550 --> 00:25:23,150
How? How hard?

577
00:25:23,220 --> 00:25:25,320
A grandma hurts about this much, right?

578
00:25:25,390 --> 00:25:28,390
And an electric cart hurts about this much.

579
00:25:28,990 --> 00:25:29,990
He's definitely smiling.

580
00:25:30,060 --> 00:25:31,160
He's smiling right there.

581
00:25:31,230 --> 00:25:32,560
I'm holding it, I'm holding it!

582
00:25:35,900 --> 00:25:37,200
You were absolutely smiling!

583
00:25:38,370 --> 00:25:40,270
He was fucking beaming!

584
00:25:40,330 --> 00:25:42,000
Damn it...

585
00:25:42,840 --> 00:25:44,410
Okay, Chihara Junior.

586
00:25:44,570 --> 00:25:47,580
So he's out?

587
00:25:47,640 --> 00:25:49,840
You're out!

588
00:25:49,910 --> 00:25:51,080
— In two hours?
— Two hours!

589
00:25:56,150 --> 00:25:57,950
So this point goes to Coo-chan

590
00:25:58,020 --> 00:26:01,390
He's gaining points.

591
00:26:01,460 --> 00:26:04,660
So this means that he's becoming quite powerful.

592
00:26:04,730 --> 00:26:05,830
That's right.

593
00:26:05,890 --> 00:26:08,530
Yeah, we still have four hours left, too.

594
00:26:08,600 --> 00:26:09,860
— Still four hours?
— It's over!

595
00:26:09,930 --> 00:26:11,630
Let's go, Junior.

596
00:26:12,070 --> 00:26:15,170
Ah, that hurts.

597
00:26:15,240 --> 00:26:18,670
I didn't think you'd be the first to go, though!

598
00:26:18,740 --> 00:26:20,780
That hurts.

599
00:26:21,140 --> 00:26:22,380
I'm bad at this!

600
00:26:30,020 --> 00:26:33,190
Who the hell pops their mouth with their fingers

601
00:26:33,250 --> 00:26:35,720
in this day and age anyways?

602
00:26:39,590 --> 00:26:42,600
That must be the first time I've seen it in this era.

603
00:26:48,500 --> 00:26:49,840
Stop it Fujimoto-san.

604
00:26:49,900 --> 00:26:50,910
What?

605
00:26:52,040 --> 00:26:54,510
To be honest, if anything, I'd like to see him react to something.

606
00:26:54,740 --> 00:26:56,940
Yeah, let's try to pinpoint who's closer to laughing.

607
00:26:57,010 --> 00:26:58,810
There's a technique to it.

608
00:27:00,580 --> 00:27:02,150
It's impossible to figure out how to do it

609
00:27:02,220 --> 00:27:04,890
this close to other people.

610
00:27:05,020 --> 00:27:06,490
Who was close to laughing?

611
00:27:10,490 --> 00:27:11,490
You're eating again?!

612
00:27:12,960 --> 00:27:14,130
Didn't you puke earlier?!

613
00:27:14,200 --> 00:27:16,630
We heard you puking like crazy from here!

614
00:27:16,700 --> 00:27:17,770
You definitely puked earlier!

615
00:27:17,830 --> 00:27:19,200
You were puking, right?

616
00:27:19,270 --> 00:27:20,530
I was just slurping.

617
00:27:20,600 --> 00:27:23,200
What? Slurping from a toilet stew or what?

618
00:27:23,270 --> 00:27:25,570
Yeah, I was slurping from the toilet.
That's why I have to...

619
00:27:25,640 --> 00:27:26,640
Of course you weren't.

620
00:27:26,710 --> 00:27:27,710
Of course not.

621
00:27:27,780 --> 00:27:28,980
What the hell?

622
00:27:29,310 --> 00:27:30,510
Mind your own business!

623
00:27:30,850 --> 00:27:32,350
I can't do whatever I please?

624
00:27:32,410 --> 00:27:34,620
Well, I guess...

625
00:27:34,680 --> 00:27:36,120
Yeah.

626
00:27:36,620 --> 00:27:38,220
Instead of butting in why don't you play along?

627
00:27:38,290 --> 00:27:39,290
Yeah, that's right.

628
00:27:39,350 --> 00:27:40,860
Yeah, I don't like Fujita to start butting in.

629
00:27:40,920 --> 00:27:42,820
Because you're probably going to laugh eventually!

630
00:27:42,890 --> 00:27:45,530
That's right!

631
00:27:45,630 --> 00:27:47,130
I get it know.
I'm going to play along with you from now on.

632
00:27:47,190 --> 00:27:49,530
I'm going to play along now.

633
00:27:56,540 --> 00:27:58,610
You're really going bald! Look at this!

634
00:27:58,670 --> 00:28:00,710
He's just like a baby!

635
00:28:00,780 --> 00:28:01,780
It really looks like a baby's head!

636
00:28:01,840 --> 00:28:03,010
He's totally a baby!

637
00:28:03,080 --> 00:28:04,910
That's so cute!

638
00:28:04,980 --> 00:28:06,710
He's really adorable.
Just look at this!

639
00:28:06,780 --> 00:28:08,780
It looks totally different from this angle.

640
00:28:09,550 --> 00:28:10,580
He's adorable.

641
00:28:11,290 --> 00:28:12,790
He's really adorable.

642
00:28:13,550 --> 00:28:14,820
And he does this face at a time like this.

643
00:28:14,820 --> 00:28:16,160
That's what he looks like when you turn him that way.

644
00:28:16,160 --> 00:28:17,530
When you turn him...

645
00:28:17,590 --> 00:28:19,490
That's right, that's right.

646
00:28:20,530 --> 00:28:22,600
But despite that, he's a serious cheater.

647
00:28:22,660 --> 00:28:25,400
That sounds like a threat but it's meant to be a compliment?

648
00:28:25,470 --> 00:28:28,070
— I saw it in Nagoya and Chiba.
— And a double in Chiba, too.

649
00:28:28,440 --> 00:28:30,200
— A double?
— Like with two different people?

650
00:28:30,270 --> 00:28:31,370
So like a threesome?

651
00:28:31,440 --> 00:28:33,410
That's just what I heard.

652
00:28:33,510 --> 00:28:36,940
Not at all, not at all.
What the hell are you saying?

653
00:28:37,550 --> 00:28:39,610
— Not at all!
— So you did them in order?

654
00:28:39,680 --> 00:28:41,020
There was no overlap at all!

655
00:28:42,320 --> 00:28:45,590
And where did they like you to touch them?

656
00:28:46,050 --> 00:28:49,490
You should ask them yourself! I'm not telling you!

657
00:28:49,560 --> 00:28:51,530
— Why not?
— I'm sure they told you anyways.

658
00:28:52,030 --> 00:28:55,230
You want me to ask you where your ex wife liked it?

659
00:28:55,460 --> 00:28:57,160
Well, that's...
I don't really care.

660
00:28:57,160 --> 00:28:58,600
— That's normal with a couple.
— Yeah, couples talk about that stuff.

661
00:28:58,600 --> 00:28:59,830
When it's someone else...

662
00:28:59,900 --> 00:29:02,040
What do your partners like about you, then?

663
00:29:03,040 --> 00:29:04,310
Like, if you're, if you're...
If you think about it,

664
00:29:04,310 --> 00:29:05,940
what do you think they liked about you?

665
00:29:06,170 --> 00:29:07,240
Everything!

666
00:29:07,310 --> 00:29:08,310
Of course not.

667
00:29:08,410 --> 00:29:10,640
— Are you stupid?
— I'm sure you just had beads in your cock.

668
00:29:10,710 --> 00:29:11,780
I didn't!

669
00:29:11,850 --> 00:29:13,350
Then they wouldn't like you, normally.

670
00:29:13,410 --> 00:29:16,550
You guys fuck? Like, you know how when you get older...

671
00:29:16,620 --> 00:29:18,550
— You don't fuck and—
— They just cuddle!

672
00:29:18,620 --> 00:29:20,150
Yeah, they just cuddle, pretty much.

673
00:29:21,690 --> 00:29:23,060
Like when old guys go to a brothel,

674
00:29:23,120 --> 00:29:24,660
and don't do anything, instead just talk,

675
00:29:24,730 --> 00:29:27,460
hold hands and stuff like that.
Is it like that?

676
00:29:27,900 --> 00:29:29,360
We fuck like rabbits.

677
00:29:29,900 --> 00:29:31,600
Well, guess that's why you're not working.

678
00:29:32,630 --> 00:29:34,370
Like rabbits?

679
00:29:34,440 --> 00:29:36,170
Can you do something else at least?

680
00:29:36,240 --> 00:29:37,710
That's nasty...
Haven't heard that in years.

681
00:29:37,770 --> 00:29:39,270
So you don't kiss?

682
00:29:40,710 --> 00:29:42,240
We start with a kiss.

683
00:29:42,310 --> 00:29:43,910
You start with a kiss?

684
00:29:44,380 --> 00:29:46,180
Isn't this kind of embarrassing?

685
00:29:46,910 --> 00:29:47,980
It's true, though.

686
00:29:48,050 --> 00:29:50,120
Can you show us how you kiss?
Just kiss the air or something.

687
00:29:50,180 --> 00:29:51,850
— Why, though?
— Then do it with Kawamoto.

688
00:29:51,920 --> 00:29:53,090
Do it with him!

689
00:29:58,330 --> 00:30:00,360
— Where's your vest?
— Over there.

690
00:30:00,730 --> 00:30:03,030
Should I do that next?

691
00:30:03,100 --> 00:30:04,100
Want to wear the vest, Kawamoto?

692
00:30:05,570 --> 00:30:07,130
You're wearing the vest?
My vest?

693
00:30:07,200 --> 00:30:09,440
You don't mind, right?
Sorry for touching it.

694
00:30:10,200 --> 00:30:12,940
It's heavier than I expected!

695
00:30:13,010 --> 00:30:15,710
It's for protection against junkies and thugs.

696
00:30:15,780 --> 00:30:16,880
Look at the back, though.

697
00:30:17,010 --> 00:30:19,650
The back's just fabric.

698
00:30:19,710 --> 00:30:21,380
You can only get away if they attack you from the front.

699
00:30:21,920 --> 00:30:24,390
It's heavy.

700
00:30:24,650 --> 00:30:25,650
What was that?

701
00:30:26,520 --> 00:30:27,960
It looks good on you.

702
00:30:28,190 --> 00:30:29,790
So what kind of kiss?

703
00:30:30,090 --> 00:30:32,990
Just imagine you're kissing your mistress.

704
00:30:33,060 --> 00:30:36,660
You know that term's kind of fucked up.

705
00:30:36,730 --> 00:30:37,730
It's not that great, yeah.

706
00:30:37,800 --> 00:30:39,330
Then how should we call her?

707
00:30:39,400 --> 00:30:40,400
— Your lover?
— Your girlfriend?

708
00:30:40,470 --> 00:30:42,240
— By her name.
— Because if we called her your girlfriend,

709
00:30:42,300 --> 00:30:45,740
wouldn't your wife get angry? Your main wife?

710
00:30:46,270 --> 00:30:47,710
That's still kind of...

711
00:30:47,780 --> 00:30:49,210
Kind of weird.

712
00:30:49,280 --> 00:30:51,280
My wife is my wife.

713
00:30:53,550 --> 00:30:54,580
Then what do we call her?

714
00:30:54,650 --> 00:30:56,480
— His partner...
— His, his girlfriend.

715
00:30:56,550 --> 00:30:58,050
— What's a good word, then?
— Your pussy?

716
00:30:58,120 --> 00:30:59,820
— I think "pussy" might work here.
— That's too much.

717
00:30:59,890 --> 00:31:02,220
Stop it with this "pussy" bullshit already.
Come on.

718
00:31:02,290 --> 00:31:04,560
— What did you call her?
— He said by her name.

719
00:31:04,630 --> 00:31:06,290
— Of course, of course.
— So by the name?

720
00:31:06,360 --> 00:31:08,360
Then just call Kawamoto by his name.

721
00:31:08,430 --> 00:31:11,730
No way! Doing that at this age?

722
00:31:12,730 --> 00:31:13,770
I'm feeling uneasy.

723
00:31:13,830 --> 00:31:15,270
Why the hell is your mouth dry?!

724
00:31:16,000 --> 00:31:17,200
Are you nervous?!

725
00:31:17,270 --> 00:31:18,940
Kawamoto will be your partner.

726
00:31:19,010 --> 00:31:21,510
Does he look like her?

727
00:31:22,440 --> 00:31:24,650
You're grabbing his head and everything?

728
00:31:24,710 --> 00:31:26,410
With your huge hands?

729
00:31:26,550 --> 00:31:27,980
Yeah!

730
00:31:28,050 --> 00:31:29,180
Don't grab his head like that!

731
00:31:29,250 --> 00:31:31,190
Isn't this getting kind of erotic?

732
00:31:31,250 --> 00:31:32,720
I love this kind of shit.

733
00:31:33,520 --> 00:31:36,060
— Okay, show us!
— He's getting pretty aggressive.

734
00:31:36,120 --> 00:31:38,430
I'm the kind of guy that opens his mouth before getting started.

735
00:31:38,490 --> 00:31:40,160
I go like "mm".

736
00:31:40,330 --> 00:31:41,660
And then you dive in?

737
00:31:41,730 --> 00:31:43,230
Do it already!

738
00:31:44,130 --> 00:31:45,430
That's lewd.

739
00:31:48,070 --> 00:31:50,300
— What the hell is going on?
— Something came out.

740
00:31:53,510 --> 00:31:55,110
— Ginger?
— Ginger.

741
00:31:55,880 --> 00:31:57,650
That's dirty...

742
00:31:58,880 --> 00:32:01,820
Did you put it in your mouth, Seiji-san?

743
00:32:02,350 --> 00:32:03,680
Let's stop this already.

744
00:32:03,880 --> 00:32:04,890
Yeah, that's enough.

745
00:32:04,950 --> 00:32:07,960
That's like when spies get poisoned and shit.

746
00:32:08,260 --> 00:32:11,830
No, I was just wondering...

747
00:32:11,890 --> 00:32:13,860
Why did I end up becoming Seiji-san's cheating partner?

748
00:32:14,190 --> 00:32:17,000
You just give off that vibe!

749
00:32:17,060 --> 00:32:18,300
— For real?
— You're just a symbol.

750
00:32:18,370 --> 00:32:19,370
Since she's—

751
00:32:19,430 --> 00:32:21,340
Since we don't have any fat grannies like that.

752
00:32:21,440 --> 00:32:22,670
— Who are you talking about?

753
00:32:22,740 --> 00:32:25,140
There was this big fat granny,

754
00:32:25,210 --> 00:32:28,280
And she always ate full of snot and everything.

755
00:32:28,340 --> 00:32:29,880
— Sugawara-san?
— Yeah, Sugawara-san!

756
00:32:31,110 --> 00:32:32,980
No, Sugawara-san was more like...

757
00:32:33,450 --> 00:32:36,650
— Her tongue would stick out?
— Regularly?

758
00:32:36,650 --> 00:32:37,620
So her tongue was always sticking out?

759
00:32:37,620 --> 00:32:39,120
Her tongue...

760
00:32:39,950 --> 00:32:41,820
I've heard her tongue tends to stick out, yeah.

761
00:32:41,890 --> 00:32:42,890
It's sticking out!

762
00:32:43,020 --> 00:32:44,020
There it is...

763
00:32:44,530 --> 00:32:45,530
Huh?

764
00:32:50,360 --> 00:32:53,930
Why are you sticking yours out?
Why are you doing that?

765
00:32:54,000 --> 00:32:55,270
That's a huge tongue.

766
00:32:57,400 --> 00:32:58,410
What the fuck are you doing?

767
00:32:59,910 --> 00:33:01,610
No clue, I just...

768
00:33:01,680 --> 00:33:04,040
I was just told that I looked like Seiji-san's cheating partner.

769
00:33:04,110 --> 00:33:06,310
And then I also just...

770
00:33:11,690 --> 00:33:12,850
He does that a lot.

771
00:33:12,920 --> 00:33:14,190
How do you do that?

772
00:33:14,250 --> 00:33:16,790
— With my tongue.
— You use your tongue as a flute?

773
00:33:17,160 --> 00:33:19,930
The tongue flute champion in Europe told me

774
00:33:19,930 --> 00:33:21,430
I was the first Japanese he had met that could do it.

775
00:33:21,430 --> 00:33:23,260
What's a flute champion, anyways?

776
00:33:23,330 --> 00:33:26,970
It's not in Japan. In Europe it's some sort of performance.

777
00:33:27,470 --> 00:33:29,100
Can I do one more short sound?

778
00:33:29,170 --> 00:33:30,670
— Do it, do it!
— Alright!

779
00:33:30,740 --> 00:33:32,070
He's god's tongue.

780
00:33:32,140 --> 00:33:33,940
Kawashima-kun. Can you help me with one?

781
00:33:34,010 --> 00:33:35,640
Kawashima-kun?

782
00:33:35,940 --> 00:33:40,050
This was half a year ago.
There was this elementary school kid going to school,

783
00:33:40,110 --> 00:33:42,420
I love kids by the way.
And I was telling him to do his best for the day,

784
00:33:42,480 --> 00:33:44,590
— You called out to him, right?
— Right, so I was patting his head,

785
00:33:44,650 --> 00:33:45,890
— Telling him to do his best,
— You shouldn't do that

786
00:33:45,950 --> 00:33:47,250
Especially in this day and age.

787
00:33:47,320 --> 00:33:49,520
And he had this alarm on his backpack,

788
00:33:49,590 --> 00:33:51,790
— like an anti-theft alarm or something?
— Yeah, I know what that is.

789
00:33:51,860 --> 00:33:53,090
And it started ringing.

790
00:33:53,160 --> 00:33:55,060
You made it ring.

791
00:33:55,130 --> 00:33:56,730
And that anti-theft alarm sounded like...

792
00:33:58,300 --> 00:34:00,370
— So Kawashima-san is the school kid?
— Right.

793
00:34:00,430 --> 00:34:01,940
What should I do?

794
00:34:02,000 --> 00:34:04,510
Good luck at school!
Do your best today!

795
00:34:04,770 --> 00:34:06,310
Good luck at school!
Good luck at—

796
00:34:11,980 --> 00:34:13,180
He's great!

797
00:34:13,380 --> 00:34:14,380
He's really good.

798
00:34:16,050 --> 00:34:18,190
That's amazing!

799
00:34:18,250 --> 00:34:19,750
And so I ran away.

800
00:34:20,320 --> 00:34:21,990
You can't run away like that!

801
00:34:22,060 --> 00:34:24,190
Well, I just...

802
00:34:24,260 --> 00:34:25,930
I was just patting his head.

803
00:34:25,990 --> 00:34:27,230
Can you do something really loud?

804
00:34:27,290 --> 00:34:28,560
Like a bomb sound or something.

805
00:34:28,630 --> 00:34:30,800
Like those really huge sounds.

806
00:34:30,860 --> 00:34:32,100
Wait a minute, okay?

807
00:34:32,300 --> 00:34:33,670
— He has something?
— No way!

808
00:34:33,730 --> 00:34:35,800
No way he has an actual bomb or something.

809
00:34:35,970 --> 00:34:39,910
So what if we have Ikko-san do the anti-theft alarm?

810
00:34:39,970 --> 00:34:42,810
Like if Ikko-san did the alarm...

811
00:34:42,880 --> 00:34:45,610
Oh, he's back.
You okay there?

812
00:34:45,680 --> 00:34:47,820
I'm fine.

813
00:34:49,280 --> 00:34:50,420
Alright.

814
00:34:51,820 --> 00:34:52,820
Which one?

815
00:34:53,750 --> 00:34:54,920
Okay, Ikko-san.

816
00:34:56,460 --> 00:34:57,690
You, you do it.

817
00:34:57,990 --> 00:34:59,890
You can do it, Chance-san.

818
00:34:59,960 --> 00:35:01,200
I'm okay.
I'm just watching now.

819
00:35:01,260 --> 00:35:03,760
Chance are you doing something?
I was just watching. Go on, do something.

820
00:35:03,830 --> 00:35:05,270
Just go with the flow.

821
00:35:05,330 --> 00:35:06,470
What the hell are you doing?

822
00:35:06,530 --> 00:35:07,630
What are you trying to say?

823
00:35:07,700 --> 00:35:08,870
Do it.

824
00:35:08,940 --> 00:35:10,940
Just say it with your mouth.

825
00:35:11,570 --> 00:35:12,610
That's a huge trophy.

826
00:35:17,640 --> 00:35:18,910
A shakuhachi? (EN: 3)

827
00:35:18,980 --> 00:35:21,380
I won the shakuhachi contest.

828
00:35:25,850 --> 00:35:27,520
You do the anti-theft.

829
00:35:27,590 --> 00:35:30,360
No, no, no.

830
00:35:30,420 --> 00:35:32,960
Oshiro, you can't just bring up that sound out of nowhere.

831
00:35:33,030 --> 00:35:34,160
— Since you're doing the shakuhachi already.

832
00:35:35,360 --> 00:35:36,760
So don't start just like that.

833
00:35:36,830 --> 00:35:38,270
Wait, why are you getting naked all of a sudden?

834
00:35:38,330 --> 00:35:39,630
Why- Why are you getting naked?

835
00:35:40,400 --> 00:35:42,500
— The last one in my sound series.
— Why did you undress?

836
00:35:42,870 --> 00:35:44,810
This is a loud sound.
I had it wrong.

837
00:35:44,870 --> 00:35:45,940
— Right, sure.
— It's loud.

838
00:35:46,010 --> 00:35:47,270
So why did you get naked?

839
00:35:47,340 --> 00:35:48,510
Okay, are we doing this?

840
00:35:48,980 --> 00:35:49,980
Okay, make a sound.

841
00:35:50,040 --> 00:35:51,110
So this is what we're doing now?

842
00:35:51,180 --> 00:35:54,050
This is the last one in my sound series.
Sorry for the trouble.

843
00:35:54,310 --> 00:35:56,080
Wow, you've got a pretty fit body, huh?

844
00:35:56,150 --> 00:35:57,150
Are you insane?!

845
00:35:59,590 --> 00:36:00,590
This?

846
00:36:00,820 --> 00:36:02,390
It's just that...

847
00:36:02,960 --> 00:36:04,760
So I'm going to do a few sounds with my back.

848
00:36:04,830 --> 00:36:06,130
— With your back?
— Yes.

849
00:36:06,190 --> 00:36:08,830
You were doing this at the 2nd street theater, right?

850
00:36:09,100 --> 00:36:10,430
He's been doing it for that long?

851
00:36:10,500 --> 00:36:12,670
I haven't seen this since about my debut.

852
00:36:12,730 --> 00:36:16,340
Okay, this is the sound of a toilet plunger.

853
00:36:18,540 --> 00:36:20,110
A toilet plunger sounds good.

854
00:36:20,640 --> 00:36:22,110
I told you.

855
00:36:25,150 --> 00:36:26,310
That sounds like a fart.

856
00:36:27,710 --> 00:36:29,980
Next comes the sound of a horse galloping.

857
00:36:30,050 --> 00:36:33,850
Neigh! Neigh!

858
00:36:34,190 --> 00:36:35,790
No, that sounds like sex.

859
00:36:38,230 --> 00:36:39,690
This is hell.

860
00:36:39,760 --> 00:36:43,160
Next comes a toad.
This is a toad.

861
00:36:45,500 --> 00:36:46,970
Whoa, it's coming from here.

862
00:36:47,030 --> 00:36:48,600
Croak croak!

863
00:36:48,670 --> 00:36:49,670
I don't understand that.

864
00:36:49,740 --> 00:36:50,900
The "croak croak" isn't necessary.

865
00:36:50,970 --> 00:36:52,710
This doesn't sound like a toad.

866
00:36:52,770 --> 00:36:54,340
What are you doing?

867
00:36:54,410 --> 00:36:55,480
Are you making a vacuum?

868
00:36:55,540 --> 00:36:56,540
A vacuum.

869
00:36:56,610 --> 00:36:58,610
You can't do it without some fat.

870
00:36:58,680 --> 00:36:59,910
You have to gain some weight.

871
00:36:59,980 --> 00:37:01,950
A creaking door from a horror film.

872
00:37:02,020 --> 00:37:03,120
Those old doors, right?

873
00:37:03,180 --> 00:37:04,180
— Is it coming?

874
00:37:12,560 --> 00:37:13,560
Ah, sorry, it's just not...

875
00:37:15,660 --> 00:37:17,700
— That's not it at all!
— One more time, one more time!

876
00:37:17,830 --> 00:37:18,870
— Can you do this?
— Yeah.

877
00:37:20,570 --> 00:37:23,640
— What's he doing?
— That's just a fart.

878
00:37:24,140 --> 00:37:26,270
And finally, the sound of a cessna landing. (EN: 4)

879
00:37:27,070 --> 00:37:28,980
— That's the last one right?
— A cessna that's—

880
00:37:29,040 --> 00:37:30,240
The one right now was just air?

881
00:37:30,240 --> 00:37:30,780
Matsuo...
The one right now was just air?

882
00:37:30,780 --> 00:37:30,840
Matsuo...

883
00:37:30,840 --> 00:37:32,110
You let some air out.
Matsuo...

884
00:37:32,110 --> 00:37:33,080
You let some air out.

885
00:37:33,150 --> 00:37:34,280
Here goes the cessna.

886
00:37:39,320 --> 00:37:40,620
Ah sorry, just one more time.

887
00:37:40,690 --> 00:37:43,490
Sorry, I let it escape.

888
00:37:43,560 --> 00:37:45,560
One more.
Just one more time like...

889
00:37:48,600 --> 00:37:49,730
There it is, there it is.

890
00:37:50,900 --> 00:37:52,600
Ah, it went that way, sorry.

891
00:37:52,670 --> 00:37:54,200
Last one, a last one.

892
00:37:55,770 --> 00:37:57,870
Should I take them off altogether?

893
00:37:57,940 --> 00:38:00,640
I wonder about this, though!

894
00:38:01,510 --> 00:38:02,680
— Who was it?
— Fujita, right?

895
00:38:02,740 --> 00:38:06,010
Fujita was smiling for a while already.

896
00:38:06,080 --> 00:38:08,280
— And Fujimoto too.
— No, I held it.

897
00:38:09,420 --> 00:38:12,290
That was pretty good!

898
00:38:12,350 --> 00:38:13,520
It was rough.

899
00:38:13,590 --> 00:38:15,620
You all managed to hold it in for a while.

900
00:38:16,420 --> 00:38:18,660
I saw Matsuo do it...

901
00:38:18,730 --> 00:38:21,460
He was smiling all the time!

902
00:38:22,300 --> 00:38:23,560
I didn't know at all!

903
00:38:23,830 --> 00:38:25,600
And also Fujita.

904
00:38:25,670 --> 00:38:29,540
To be honest, I was in a pretty tight spot at the end.

905
00:38:33,410 --> 00:38:34,710
Don't say it.

906
00:38:34,780 --> 00:38:35,910
This is a fart.

907
00:38:36,440 --> 00:38:38,410
And finally, the sound of a cessna landing!

908
00:38:39,580 --> 00:38:41,150
— He said the last one, right?
— A cessna...

909
00:38:41,210 --> 00:38:43,020
Are you making that sound with air?

910
00:38:43,080 --> 00:38:45,350
You let some air out.

911
00:38:45,420 --> 00:38:46,520
Here goes the cessna.

912
00:38:51,630 --> 00:38:52,860
I'm sorry, just one more time.

913
00:38:52,930 --> 00:38:55,760
The air's going out, sorry.

914
00:38:55,830 --> 00:38:57,730
Just one more time.
It's gonna go like...

915
00:39:00,770 --> 00:39:01,970
There it is, there it is.

916
00:39:03,240 --> 00:39:04,940
Sorry, it went that way.

917
00:39:05,010 --> 00:39:06,610
One last time, I'm sorry.

918
00:39:06,670 --> 00:39:08,340
Fujita was in trouble, huh?

919
00:39:08,410 --> 00:39:10,010
Fujita, you were screwed!

920
00:39:10,280 --> 00:39:11,480
No way!

921
00:39:12,080 --> 00:39:14,580
Wait a second!
Come on, come on!

922
00:39:15,020 --> 00:39:17,150
At least make it work out, come on!

923
00:39:17,220 --> 00:39:19,520
Okay, Fujita and Matsuo get...

924
00:39:19,590 --> 00:39:21,150
Come on!

925
00:39:21,220 --> 00:39:23,420
It's getting pretty warmed up.

926
00:39:23,490 --> 00:39:25,130
Everyone else has a yellow?

927
00:39:25,190 --> 00:39:26,330
— Yellow.
— I'm orange.

928
00:39:26,390 --> 00:39:27,590
— Orange.
— Orange too.

929
00:39:27,660 --> 00:39:29,400
Only Ku-kun has nothing.

930
00:39:29,830 --> 00:39:31,330
— Nothing?
— No color.

931
00:39:31,400 --> 00:39:33,500
He has none.

932
00:39:33,570 --> 00:39:35,100
He's been sneaking a laugh here and there.

933
00:39:35,170 --> 00:39:38,140
But I've been holding it like.

934
00:39:38,210 --> 00:39:40,310
He's gotten like this.

935
00:39:40,370 --> 00:39:41,580
I've never done that!

936
00:39:41,640 --> 00:39:42,980
Never!

937
00:39:51,720 --> 00:39:53,050
Everyone has a yellow?

938
00:39:53,120 --> 00:39:55,220
I got one.

939
00:39:55,490 --> 00:39:57,890
Okay, let's watch some porn to change the mood.

940
00:39:58,260 --> 00:40:01,130
You're gonna watch here?

941
00:40:01,560 --> 00:40:03,000
At least pay some money.

942
00:40:03,660 --> 00:40:05,200
They're free, though.

943
00:40:05,270 --> 00:40:07,300
I guess so, yeah.

944
00:40:07,630 --> 00:40:09,140
Damn, it was too hot.

945
00:40:09,840 --> 00:40:10,840
His nose is bleeding.

946
00:40:10,900 --> 00:40:11,910
Damn it, yeah.

947
00:40:11,970 --> 00:40:14,110
It's too hot.

948
00:40:14,840 --> 00:40:18,110
It's close, but the color's a bit off.
It's from Tokyu Hands? (EN: 5)

949
00:40:19,950 --> 00:40:21,210
I made it myself.

950
00:40:21,280 --> 00:40:23,780
— How?
— I used some pigment and... it hurts.

951
00:40:23,850 --> 00:40:25,150
You mixed in some shrimp, too?

952
00:40:25,220 --> 00:40:26,750
Yeah, it looks like shrimp.
When you boil them.

953
00:40:26,820 --> 00:40:28,720
It hurts!

954
00:40:28,790 --> 00:40:30,420
Looks like boiled shrimp.

955
00:40:30,490 --> 00:40:34,560
Recently, I got a call from a friend.

956
00:40:34,630 --> 00:40:35,630
Yeah?

957
00:40:35,860 --> 00:40:37,100
— So...
— Excuse me.

958
00:40:38,500 --> 00:40:44,540
My friend's company wants some work with Yoshimoto or something.

959
00:40:45,370 --> 00:40:47,440
— You have a lighter?
— We don't have any here.

960
00:40:47,710 --> 00:40:49,410
— You have a lighter?
— I was wondering

961
00:40:49,480 --> 00:40:52,110
if I was in the wrong with something that happened recently.

962
00:40:53,850 --> 00:40:55,050
Whatever it was, you were in the wrong.

963
00:40:55,480 --> 00:40:56,480
For sure.

964
00:40:56,550 --> 00:40:58,950
It's over. It's over!

965
00:40:59,950 --> 00:41:03,860
Listen, listen.
I was riding the bullet train.

966
00:41:06,160 --> 00:41:07,330
— The bullet train.
— Yeah.

967
00:41:07,390 --> 00:41:09,900
So, I had to go to the bathroom.

968
00:41:09,960 --> 00:41:11,230
That's your fault.

969
00:41:11,400 --> 00:41:13,800
— It's over!
— So I was in the wrong?

970
00:41:13,870 --> 00:41:15,170
No wait, no way it's my fault!

971
00:41:15,240 --> 00:41:17,070
And so...

972
00:41:17,140 --> 00:41:18,140
I went to the bathroom.

973
00:41:18,210 --> 00:41:19,510
— Why did you take it?
— What did you do?

974
00:41:19,570 --> 00:41:21,780
So the sign read vacant, right?

975
00:41:21,840 --> 00:41:23,410
So I opened the door,

976
00:41:23,480 --> 00:41:28,350
and there was this like twenty year old sitting on the toilet,

977
00:41:28,420 --> 00:41:31,320
and he was using some earphones and looking at his phone,

978
00:41:31,550 --> 00:41:33,150
and he was jerking off.

979
00:41:33,690 --> 00:41:35,890
— Where was that?
— The bullet train's toilet.

980
00:41:36,120 --> 00:41:39,190
He was like this on the toilet.

981
00:41:39,930 --> 00:41:41,360
I think he forgot to lock the door.

982
00:41:41,490 --> 00:41:44,200
So I opened it and he was just like this.

983
00:41:44,260 --> 00:41:45,900
And since he had earphones on, he didn't notice at first.

984
00:41:45,970 --> 00:41:48,370
But I guess he noticed the air, turned,

985
00:41:48,440 --> 00:41:50,070
and closed the door.

986
00:41:50,700 --> 00:41:53,910
I didn't really understand, but after seeing him jerking off,

987
00:41:54,070 --> 00:41:55,740
I just apologized and closed it.

988
00:41:57,140 --> 00:42:00,150
But thinking about it...
Was it my fault?

989
00:42:01,620 --> 00:42:04,150
What do you think?
He was jerking off.

990
00:42:04,220 --> 00:42:05,720
— It was your fault.
— I think it was your fault.

991
00:42:05,790 --> 00:42:07,990
Because you wanted to go to the bathroom at that moment.

992
00:42:08,050 --> 00:42:09,390
It's your fault.

993
00:42:09,720 --> 00:42:11,690
I didn't do anything wrong, though!

994
00:42:12,330 --> 00:42:14,060
He was the one jerking off!

995
00:42:14,900 --> 00:42:16,460
What do you mean by jerking off?

996
00:42:17,130 --> 00:42:18,130
Jerking off is jerking off.

997
00:42:18,200 --> 00:42:19,900
Isn't it jacking off?
It's jerking off.

998
00:42:19,970 --> 00:42:21,700
Jacking off?
Honestly, both are the same.

999
00:42:21,770 --> 00:42:25,270
Are you sure he was doing it?

1000
00:42:25,340 --> 00:42:28,710
Do you know what he normally looks like when he does it?

1001
00:42:30,180 --> 00:42:32,650
There's no way you can tell he was doing it!

1002
00:42:33,150 --> 00:42:35,450
I think you're a little weird.

1003
00:42:35,520 --> 00:42:37,080
I think you're onto something.

1004
00:42:37,150 --> 00:42:40,190
Since you don't know what he looks like

1005
00:42:40,250 --> 00:42:42,820
— When you apologize,
— I'm telling you he was jerking off.

1006
00:42:42,890 --> 00:42:44,190
You have to say that out loud, man.

1007
00:42:58,610 --> 00:43:00,140
I thought that was a ticking time bomb.

1008
00:43:01,040 --> 00:43:02,510
— What happened?
— What are you doing?

1009
00:43:02,580 --> 00:43:03,610
That scared me.

1010
00:43:03,680 --> 00:43:04,910
— What's wrong?
— What happened?

1011
00:43:05,450 --> 00:43:07,550
— Matsuo...
— Something happened?

1012
00:43:07,610 --> 00:43:08,820
Something happened.

1013
00:43:08,880 --> 00:43:10,650
What is it?

1014
00:43:10,720 --> 00:43:12,850
— Where?
— Matsuo?

1015
00:43:12,920 --> 00:43:14,490
— Where?!
— Matsuo?

1016
00:43:14,550 --> 00:43:16,190
I'm asking you where!

1017
00:43:16,260 --> 00:43:18,020
— Where you are?
— Where?!

1018
00:43:18,090 --> 00:43:19,960
This is...
The studio.

1019
00:43:20,030 --> 00:43:22,830
— Well, this is the studio.
— I'm asking you where!

1020
00:43:22,900 --> 00:43:24,160
I'm telling you this is the studio!

1021
00:43:24,600 --> 00:43:26,530
The "Documental" set!

1022
00:43:26,600 --> 00:43:28,500
I'm asking you where!!

1023
00:43:28,570 --> 00:43:29,740
— It's the studio!
— It's Wangan Studio! (EN: 6)

1024
00:43:29,800 --> 00:43:31,600
I'm asking you where!

1025
00:43:31,670 --> 00:43:32,770
We're telling you!

1026
00:43:32,840 --> 00:43:34,040
Where?!

1027
00:43:34,110 --> 00:43:35,710
— It's Wangan...
— I'm asking you where!

1028
00:43:35,780 --> 00:43:37,780
Where?! Where?!

1029
00:43:37,840 --> 00:43:39,380
— Wangan!
— Shut up! It's Wangan!

1030
00:43:39,850 --> 00:43:42,050
— Where?!
— Shut up, idiot!

1031
00:43:42,120 --> 00:43:43,620
— Where?!
— Wangan!

1032
00:43:43,680 --> 00:43:45,420
— Where?!
— Wangan!

1033
00:43:45,490 --> 00:43:46,550
Where?

1034
00:43:46,620 --> 00:43:47,820
Wangan!

1035
00:43:47,890 --> 00:43:49,020
Where?!

1036
00:43:49,090 --> 00:43:50,160
Wangan!

1037
00:43:51,090 --> 00:43:52,090
Where did you come from?

1038
00:43:52,160 --> 00:43:53,230
Where?!

1039
00:43:53,290 --> 00:43:54,530
Where did you come from?

1040
00:43:54,530 --> 00:43:56,250
— Where do you want to go?
— Are you talking about this place?

1041
00:43:56,360 --> 00:43:58,230
I'm asking you where!

1042
00:43:59,200 --> 00:44:00,730
Where?!

1043
00:44:01,270 --> 00:44:02,470
Where?!

1044
00:44:02,540 --> 00:44:04,100
— Shut up for now!
— Where?!

1045
00:44:04,170 --> 00:44:05,170
What? Tokyo...

1046
00:44:05,240 --> 00:44:07,140
I'm asking you where!

1047
00:44:08,780 --> 00:44:12,310
Where?!
Tell me where!!

1048
00:44:12,510 --> 00:44:14,310
— What do you mean?!
— I feel sorry for him.

1049
00:44:14,380 --> 00:44:15,620
Where?!

1050
00:44:15,680 --> 00:44:16,980
Are you talking about this place?

1051
00:44:17,180 --> 00:44:19,950
I'm asking you where! Tell me!!

1052
00:44:20,020 --> 00:44:21,860
— What's with this guy?
— Where?!

1053
00:44:21,920 --> 00:44:22,990
Is he stupid?

1054
00:44:23,060 --> 00:44:24,060
Isn't he spitting on you?

1055
00:44:24,120 --> 00:44:26,890
I'm asking you where!!

1056
00:44:27,160 --> 00:44:29,700
I'm begging you!! Tell me!!

1057
00:44:29,760 --> 00:44:30,860
I'll tell you, I'll tell you.

1058
00:44:30,930 --> 00:44:32,400
Where?!

1059
00:44:32,470 --> 00:44:33,830
I don't know that guy.

1060
00:44:34,130 --> 00:44:35,500
I'm begging you!

1061
00:44:36,240 --> 00:44:38,410
I'm beggin you!! Where?!

1062
00:44:38,470 --> 00:44:39,470
No, no. What are you...?

1063
00:44:39,540 --> 00:44:41,440
I'm asking you where!!

1064
00:44:42,610 --> 00:44:43,710
Are you talking about Tokyo?

1065
00:44:43,780 --> 00:44:45,910
I'm asking you where!!

1066
00:44:45,980 --> 00:44:49,150
Well, we're in Odaiba.
Or more specifically, in Wangan Studio.

1067
00:44:49,220 --> 00:44:50,450
— He's really Aladdin.
— Broadly speaking.

1068
00:44:50,520 --> 00:44:52,120
— He looks like an aunt.
— For real.

1069
00:44:52,590 --> 00:44:53,720
Calm down.

1070
00:44:53,790 --> 00:44:55,290
Where did you come from?

1071
00:44:55,360 --> 00:44:57,920
What?
I'm asking you where!!

1072
00:44:57,990 --> 00:44:59,860
Calm down, calm down.
Have something to drink.

1073
00:44:59,930 --> 00:45:01,590
I'm asking you where!!

1074
00:45:01,590 --> 00:45:02,900
— You don't remember anything?
— Drink some tea.

1075
00:45:02,960 --> 00:45:04,360
You don't remember anything?

1076
00:45:04,430 --> 00:45:05,630
Where did you come from?

1077
00:45:05,700 --> 00:45:06,700
Yeah, yeah.

1078
00:45:06,770 --> 00:45:08,070
Huh?

1079
00:45:08,130 --> 00:45:10,570
You remembered?

1080
00:45:10,640 --> 00:45:15,110
Where?!
I'm asking you where?!

1081
00:45:15,180 --> 00:45:16,480
It's okay, it's okay.

1082
00:45:16,540 --> 00:45:18,180
— Where?!
— We're telling you!

1083
00:45:18,240 --> 00:45:20,050
Please tell me!!

1084
00:45:20,210 --> 00:45:22,180
— I'm begging you!
— Wangan!

1085
00:45:22,580 --> 00:45:24,250
We're in Wangan!

1086
00:45:24,550 --> 00:45:27,490
We're in Wangan!

1087
00:45:28,720 --> 00:45:30,720
We're in Wangan, man!!

1088
00:45:30,790 --> 00:45:32,190
That's good, that's good.

1089
00:45:32,260 --> 00:45:33,860
— We're in Wangan!
— Where?!

1090
00:45:33,930 --> 00:45:35,030
— We're in Wangan!
— Where?!

1091
00:45:35,100 --> 00:45:36,230
That's good!

1092
00:45:36,300 --> 00:45:38,830
— Where?!
— This is Wangan!!

1093
00:45:38,900 --> 00:45:40,530
— Where?!
— We're in Wangan!

1094
00:45:40,600 --> 00:45:42,700
— Where?!
— We're in Wangan!!

1095
00:45:42,770 --> 00:45:44,700
Ah damn it.
You have to top him, somehow.

1096
00:45:44,770 --> 00:45:47,740
— Where?!
— We're in Wangan!!

1097
00:45:48,110 --> 00:45:50,210
This is a good duel!
They're dying, they're dying.

1098
00:45:50,510 --> 00:45:52,450
— They're gonna die.
— This is a good duel.

1099
00:45:52,510 --> 00:45:54,350
Where?!

1100
00:45:56,250 --> 00:45:59,520
We're in Wangan!!

1101
00:46:00,020 --> 00:46:02,920
Wangan Wangan Wangan Wangan!!

1102
00:46:02,990 --> 00:46:04,160
— Wangan!!
— Come on!

1103
00:46:04,160 --> 00:46:04,620
He's gonna die.
— Wangan!!
— Come on!

1104
00:46:04,620 --> 00:46:04,690
He's gonna die.

1105
00:46:04,690 --> 00:46:05,560
Wangan Wangan! This is Wangan!!
He's gonna die.

1106
00:46:05,560 --> 00:46:07,460
Wangan Wangan! This is Wangan!!

1107
00:46:07,530 --> 00:46:10,630
Wangan Wangan! This is Wangan!!

1108
00:46:10,700 --> 00:46:13,770
Wangan Wangan Wangan!!

1109
00:46:13,830 --> 00:46:16,740
Wangan Wangan! This is Wangan!!

1110
00:46:16,800 --> 00:46:17,770
Wangan Wangan!

1111
00:46:17,770 --> 00:46:18,240
Huh?
Wangan Wangan!

1112
00:46:18,240 --> 00:46:18,300
Huh?

1113
00:46:18,300 --> 00:46:23,440
Wangan Wangan!

1114
00:46:23,510 --> 00:46:25,210
Alright! He did it!

1115
00:46:25,280 --> 00:46:27,250
— He did it! He won!
— Nice!

1116
00:46:28,010 --> 00:46:30,520
That was amazing!

1117
00:46:30,580 --> 00:46:32,750
Really nice!

1118
00:46:33,690 --> 00:46:34,950
— That sucked.
— Amazing.

1119
00:46:35,020 --> 00:46:36,390
That was completely amazing.

1120
00:46:36,720 --> 00:46:38,560
— Great!
— What an amazing power!

1121
00:46:38,630 --> 00:46:39,690
That was powerful.

1122
00:46:39,760 --> 00:46:41,930
What a great counter.

1123
00:46:42,800 --> 00:46:45,060
Come on!

1124
00:46:46,700 --> 00:46:47,900
That was amazing!

1125
00:46:47,970 --> 00:46:49,300
It was great.

1126
00:46:49,370 --> 00:46:50,570
It was incredible.

1127
00:46:50,940 --> 00:46:52,940
That was power vs power!

1128
00:46:53,540 --> 00:46:55,510
— Thank you very much.
— Pushed to the edge.

1129
00:46:55,580 --> 00:46:58,780
That was a nice try.
And you tried from the very beginning.

1130
00:46:59,310 --> 00:47:00,710
— It was an amazing counter.
— It was too hard.

1131
00:47:00,780 --> 00:47:03,320
It was terrible.

1132
00:47:03,380 --> 00:47:05,080
I had to put an end to him.

1133
00:47:06,050 --> 00:47:08,390
You're all hoarse now!

1134
00:47:08,450 --> 00:47:10,090
His voice is done for!

1135
00:47:12,730 --> 00:47:14,660
His throat is all messed up.

1136
00:47:14,730 --> 00:47:17,960
I guess this is just that...
Shouji is amazing.

1137
00:47:18,160 --> 00:47:21,000
I think this raises Shouji's name.

1138
00:47:21,900 --> 00:47:23,740
Where?!

1139
00:47:25,570 --> 00:47:28,910
We're in Wangan!!

1140
00:47:29,480 --> 00:47:32,310
Wangan! Wangan!

1141
00:47:32,380 --> 00:47:34,010
— Wangan!!
— Come on!

1142
00:47:34,080 --> 00:47:36,920
Wangan! Wangan! This is Wangan!!

1143
00:47:36,980 --> 00:47:40,020
Wangan! Wangan! This is Wangan!!

1144
00:47:40,090 --> 00:47:43,120
Wangan! Wangan! Wangan! Wangan!

1145
00:47:43,190 --> 00:47:46,160
Wangan! Wangan! This is Wangan!!

1146
00:47:46,230 --> 00:47:47,590
Wangan! Wangan!

1147
00:47:47,660 --> 00:47:52,770
Wangan! Wangan! Wangan! Wangan!

1148
00:47:52,830 --> 00:47:54,300
Alright! He did it!

1149
00:47:55,300 --> 00:47:56,640
It was too rough!

1150
00:47:56,700 --> 00:47:58,200
It definitely looked rough, yeah!

1151
00:47:58,270 --> 00:47:59,270
It was too hard!

1152
00:47:59,340 --> 00:48:00,970
That's Shouji's specialty.

1153
00:48:01,040 --> 00:48:05,350
And even though there was some assistance,
this is just completely

1154
00:48:08,250 --> 00:48:10,220
We had to take him down.

1155
00:48:10,280 --> 00:48:11,650
— Huh? Matso?
— This is your first one?

1156
00:48:11,720 --> 00:48:13,350
No, I got an orange earlier.

1157
00:48:13,720 --> 00:48:15,520
Really Ma-chan?! An orange?

1158
00:48:15,590 --> 00:48:17,590
— That's right, Matsuo.
— One from earlier, right?

1159
00:48:17,660 --> 00:48:20,060
So I had to attack since I had an orange.

1160
00:48:21,630 --> 00:48:23,160
So you ended up falling for the counter.

1161
00:48:23,230 --> 00:48:25,400
Matsuo! You're out!

1162
00:48:33,370 --> 00:48:34,670
Shouji's points look like trouble!

1163
00:48:36,540 --> 00:48:39,810
And also Fujita's awful nosebleed.

1164
00:48:39,880 --> 00:48:44,420
I'm never going to forget that.
It should've been a little thicker.

1165
00:48:44,480 --> 00:48:45,890
— Yeah, right.
— Yeah.

1166
00:48:46,220 --> 00:48:47,850
— I guess I was losing in a way.
— It's like looking at your sheets

1167
00:48:47,920 --> 00:48:49,320
after she finally goes home.

1168
00:48:50,590 --> 00:48:51,760
Kinda gross.

1169
00:48:51,820 --> 00:48:53,590
You've had girls like that over?

1170
00:48:53,690 --> 00:48:55,660
I love them!

1171
00:48:55,730 --> 00:48:57,160
No, that's not what I meant!

1172
00:48:57,230 --> 00:48:58,430
Are you still a virgin?

1173
00:48:58,500 --> 00:49:00,670
And we're still joking with Ma-chan!

1174
00:49:02,440 --> 00:49:04,840
Are you okay? Aren't the big shots at Amazon gonna get mad?

1175
00:49:04,900 --> 00:49:06,470
I'm taking this with me.

1176
00:49:06,540 --> 00:49:08,040
That was my most recent "love story".

1177
00:49:08,110 --> 00:49:09,310
You liar!

1178
00:49:09,610 --> 00:49:11,540
That's a filthy love story!

1179
00:49:11,610 --> 00:49:12,780
That's not about love!

1180
00:49:12,850 --> 00:49:14,780
That's frustrating.

1181
00:49:14,850 --> 00:49:17,550
I was ready to do a lot more.

1182
00:49:17,620 --> 00:49:19,350
I wanted to go further than that.

1183
00:49:19,420 --> 00:49:20,920
— Where?!
— Wangan!

1184
00:49:20,990 --> 00:49:22,720
— Where?!
— Wangan!!

1185
00:49:22,790 --> 00:49:23,860
Where?!

1186
00:49:23,920 --> 00:49:25,160
We're in Wangan!!

1187
00:49:25,260 --> 00:49:26,260
Where?!

1188
00:49:26,330 --> 00:49:27,460
Wangan!!

1189
00:49:28,090 --> 00:49:30,460
I wasn't expecting Shouji-san to get there.

1190
00:49:30,860 --> 00:49:32,530
We're in Wangan!!

1191
00:49:34,370 --> 00:49:36,840
The moment Shouji came running towards me I was already in trouble.

1192
00:49:37,340 --> 00:49:39,770
I kept thinking that this was bad.

1193
00:49:40,110 --> 00:49:43,340
I think that was the moment I realized I was screwed.

1194
00:49:44,040 --> 00:49:47,450
I was thinking that it was impossible to get out of that.

1195
00:49:47,510 --> 00:49:49,320
I was just hoping he'd get it over with soon.

1196
00:49:49,380 --> 00:49:54,390
Wangan! Wangan! Wangan! Wangan!

1197
00:49:54,450 --> 00:49:55,460
Alright!

1198
00:49:55,520 --> 00:49:57,560
I didn't expect to get such an amazing counter.

1199
00:49:57,620 --> 00:49:58,830
I couldn't think about it.

1200
00:50:03,360 --> 00:50:04,360
That hurts like hell!!

1201
00:50:06,070 --> 00:50:08,940
He's gone already?

1202
00:50:09,000 --> 00:50:10,940
Is he a dying cat?

1203
00:50:16,840 --> 00:50:17,840
This is...

1204
00:50:20,080 --> 00:50:21,450
Come on you...
