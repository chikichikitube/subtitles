It's an American joke!!

178
00:04:25,860 --> 00:04:28,960
Looks like you're not that good with 'merican comedy

179
00:04:28,300 --> 00:04:29,100
'merican comedy?

180
00:04:29,960 --> 00:04:31,270
Japanese Television...

181
00:04:31,270 --> 00:04:36,370
Is filled with shows of comedians just walking in the streets!!

182
00:04:36,370 --> 00:04:37,160
Don't call it out!

183
00:04:36,970 --> 00:04:38,340
Moreover...

184
00:04:38,340 --> 00:04:41,780
His tone suddenly changed

185
00:04:40,820 --> 00:04:46,250
The way his tone is changing is too rapid!

186
00:04:44,360 --> 00:04:46,250
It's scary!

187
00:04:46,250 --> 00:04:47,680
It's scary!

188
00:04:47,680 --> 00:04:48,680
This year's theme is American Police 'kay!?

189
00:04:48,680 --> 00:04:53,120
This year's theme is American Police 'kay!?

190
00:04:50,880 --> 00:04:52,820
How is this related to Japan?

191
00:04:53,220 --> 00:04:54,880
What is American Police?

192
00:04:54,880 --> 00:04:55,920
How is this related?

193
00:04:55,920 --> 00:04:56,560
This place is Chiba

194
00:04:55,920 --> 00:04:58,630
T/N: Chiba is a prefecture to the east of Tokyo

195
00:04:56,560 --> 00:04:58,630
This place is Chiba

196
00:04:57,820 --> 00:04:59,730
This time...

197
00:04:59,730 --> 00:05:03,830
At the first American Police Station Japan Branch...

198
00:05:03,830 --> 00:05:05,500
You guys will be protecting Japan's peace.

199
00:05:05,900 --> 00:05:13,810
They'll become American Policemen

200
00:05:05,900 --> 00:05:13,810
They'll face a harsh job!!

201
00:05:06,480 --> 00:05:08,140
And with that...

202
00:05:08,140 --> 00:05:13,040
They'll become American Police recruits and face the harsh job!!

203
00:05:09,260 --> 00:05:11,960
Look at Hosei!

204
00:05:11,960 --> 00:05:13,680
NOT THAT PICTURE!

205
00:05:13,680 --> 00:05:14,540
Not that one!

206
00:05:14,200 --> 00:05:15,240
An old one right?

207
00:05:15,240 --> 00:05:18,360
I said American Police but what's with those outfits?

208
00:05:18,360 --> 00:05:20,470
We've prepared for you guys to get changed over there

209
00:05:20,470 --> 00:05:22,020
Can you get changed and come back?

210
00:05:22,470 --> 00:05:25,940
The first step in becoming an American Police officer

211
00:05:22,470 --> 00:05:28,960
Before they work at the Police Station

212
00:05:22,470 --> 00:05:28,960
They'll get changed into the uniform

213
00:05:25,940 --> 00:05:28,960
Changing into the appropriate clothes.

214
00:05:28,960 --> 00:05:30,560
Hamada and the staff...

215
00:05:30,560 --> 00:05:32,960
have an elaborate meeting for this

216
00:05:33,660 --> 00:05:35,560
Is everybody done changing?

217
00:05:37,930 --> 00:05:39,600
Can you guys all come out one after the other?

218
00:05:39,730 --> 00:05:41,080
Matsumoto! Come on!

219
00:05:41,080 --> 00:05:42,270
Matsumoto! Come on!

220
00:05:44,310 --> 00:05:46,310
Looks good on you!!

221
00:05:45,310 --> 00:05:46,600
Thank you very much.

222
00:05:46,310 --> 00:05:48,680
You've gotten pretty strong huh...

223
00:05:48,380 --> 00:05:49,400
Thanks

224
00:05:49,400 --> 00:05:51,910
You're the Powerful American Policeman!

225
00:05:51,910 --> 00:05:55,750
Powerful American Policeman

226
00:05:53,040 --> 00:05:54,260
Alright.

227
00:05:54,940 --> 00:05:56,560
Okay, next, Endo!

228
00:05:56,560 --> 00:05:58,200
I saw that coming

229
00:05:58,200 --> 00:06:00,200
Right?

230
00:05:59,090 --> 00:06:00,520
What a handsome guy!

231
00:06:00,520 --> 00:06:03,590
You're good-looking  as ever!

232
00:06:02,240 --> 00:06:03,260
Thanks

233
00:06:03,730 --> 00:06:04,930
You're the Handsome Policeman.

234
00:06:04,930 --> 00:06:08,430
Handsome American Policeman

235
00:06:05,060 --> 00:06:07,040
Thanks

236
00:06:07,040 --> 00:06:08,430
Next, Tanaka!

237
00:06:11,900 --> 00:06:13,330
I know a lot has happened to you but have you lost weight again?

238
00:06:12,030 --> 00:06:17,270
Translator's Note: Referring to Tanaka getting divorced this year

239
00:06:13,330 --> 00:06:17,270
I know a lot has happened to you but have you lost weight again?

240
00:06:15,460 --> 00:06:17,270
That has nothing to do with it...

241
00:06:17,320 --> 00:06:19,410
Paper-thin American Policeman

242
00:06:19,410 --> 00:06:22,180
Paper-thin American Policeman

243
00:06:20,940 --> 00:06:22,180
Paper-thin Policeman?

244
00:06:22,300 --> 00:06:24,300
Next, Hosei!

245
00:06:26,180 --> 00:06:27,750
So cute!!

246
00:06:27,750 --> 00:06:30,350
No matter how old you get you're cute!!

247
00:06:30,490 --> 00:06:32,250
American Angel Policeman!

248
00:06:32,250 --> 00:06:35,590
American Angel Policeman!

249
00:06:34,440 --> 00:06:35,880
Next, Hamada!

250
00:06:35,880 --> 00:06:37,420
Come on!

251
00:06:37,830 --> 00:06:42,800
Only Hamada is Eddie Murphy

252
00:06:42,800 --> 00:06:45,700
No way!!

253
00:06:45,700 --> 00:06:47,440
I thought it was gonna be crazy but...

254
00:06:47,660 --> 00:06:50,120
That's why it took so long!

255
00:06:48,500 --> 00:06:50,120
It really took some time!

256
00:06:50,120 --> 00:06:53,680
They kept applying the black till it got this...

257
00:06:53,680 --> 00:06:55,960
This tone...

258
00:06:54,760 --> 00:06:55,960
Seriously!

259
00:06:57,710 --> 00:07:01,320
It was so rough...

260
00:07:02,440 --> 00:07:03,350
You're different from our outfits!

261
00:07:03,350 --> 00:07:05,650
But I am a policeman right?

262
00:07:05,080 --> 00:07:05,650
Yeah.

263
00:07:06,220 --> 00:07:13,430
Beverly Hills Cop

264
00:07:06,300 --> 00:07:13,430
A movie that premiered in 1984

265
00:07:06,300 --> 00:07:13,430
Featured Eddy Murphy playing the role of a Detroit cop.

266
00:07:06,300 --> 00:07:13,430
White Box

267
00:07:06,740 --> 00:07:07,660
Beverly Hills!

268
00:07:07,660 --> 00:07:09,620
Beverly Hills Cop!

269
00:07:09,620 --> 00:07:12,190
He's gonna be like this the whole time?

270
00:07:13,420 --> 00:07:14,600
Yeah.

271
00:07:14,950 --> 00:07:16,500
This guy is a cop right?

272
00:07:16,400 --> 00:07:17,670
Eh..... Seriously?

273
00:07:17,670 --> 00:07:19,170
Eh..... Seriously?

274
00:07:19,100 --> 00:07:21,540
That's evil! We're gonna laugh so easy from this.

275
00:07:21,540 --> 00:07:25,840
It's gonna be hard if he's with us the whole time.

276
00:07:25,840 --> 00:07:37,150
Absolutely No Laughing Rules

277
00:07:26,820 --> 00:07:29,380
Plainly speaking the rules are simple.

278
00:07:27,810 --> 00:07:37,150
As American Police recruits they work in a hard job

279
00:07:28,040 --> 00:07:37,150
While on the job they can't laugh

280
00:07:28,140 --> 00:07:37,150
If they do laugh they face a punishment

281
00:07:29,380 --> 00:07:34,660
While they are working at the station they cannot laugh.

282
00:07:34,660 --> 00:07:37,150
That is all there is.

283
00:07:37,380 --> 00:07:37,990
Now then...

284
00:07:37,990 --> 00:07:40,620
The police station bus is coming so let's go.

285
00:07:40,620 --> 00:07:43,690
Is it really alright to change the pace this fast?

286
00:07:42,980 --> 00:07:43,690
Right?

287
00:07:43,690 --> 00:07:46,060
This is so different...

288
00:07:45,100 --> 00:07:46,060
Here it is.

289
00:07:46,360 --> 00:07:50,530
The cruel job closing in

290
00:07:47,160 --> 00:07:50,670
Moment by moment, the cruel job approaches them...

291
00:07:50,720 --> 00:07:55,240
The Police Station stage will be made clear...

292
00:07:50,860 --> 00:07:55,240
The Police Station stage will be made clear...

293
00:07:55,540 --> 00:07:56,400
Ah, it's here

294
00:07:56,400 --> 00:07:58,010
Everyone! The bus is here!

295
00:07:58,280 --> 00:08:00,280
Why do we have to ride a bus?

296
00:08:00,280 --> 00:08:02,280
That looks nice.

297
00:08:02,540 --> 00:08:03,520
This bus was also leaked all over Twitter

298
00:08:03,040 --> 00:08:06,550
This bus was also leaked all over Twitter

299
00:08:06,550 --> 00:08:09,250
It was all over the place

300
00:08:09,560 --> 00:08:13,320
T/N: "Omame" is Heipo's nickname which means "bean". It refers to Heipo's small physical frame.

301
00:08:09,560 --> 00:08:13,320
The Heipo State Omame Central Police Department

302
00:08:13,320 --> 00:08:15,590
This is the name of the police station we're going to.

303
00:08:15,590 --> 00:08:18,090
Why the hell is this guy so high ranking?

304
00:08:18,090 --> 00:08:20,700
This guy is nowhere close to being this important!!

305
00:08:20,700 --> 00:08:21,330
He eats Komoro Soba all alone.

306
00:08:20,700 --> 00:08:24,500
T/N: Komoro Soba is a cheap chain noodle shop that has stores all over Tokyo. Most of their customers are workers and it is rather standard and plain.

307
00:08:21,330 --> 00:08:23,360
He eats Komoro Soba all alone.

308
00:08:23,500 --> 00:08:25,800
With a face on the brink of death

309
00:08:27,600 --> 00:08:32,700
Heipo State Omame Central Police Department bus!

310
00:08:34,140 --> 00:08:38,640
With this bus that is designed with the founder of the Heipo Police

311
00:08:38,600 --> 00:08:42,920
Headed towards the police station they are stationed at!

312
00:08:39,580 --> 00:08:42,920
They will head towards the Police Station!

313
00:08:43,520 --> 00:08:47,150
Once you've got yourself prepared get on the bus!

314
00:08:47,240 --> 00:08:47,820
Seriously...

315
00:08:47,820 --> 00:08:51,090
I'm the only one that has nothing to do with this theme...

316
00:08:48,060 --> 00:08:49,180
Here we go...

317
00:08:55,640 --> 00:08:58,300
Well there's nothing we can do about this, guys.

318
00:08:57,180 --> 00:08:58,300
Right.

319
00:08:57,920 --> 00:08:58,300
Yeah...

320
00:08:58,300 --> 00:09:00,500
Alright, I'll be boarding now!

321
00:08:59,440 --> 00:09:00,500
Let's get started...

322
00:09:00,640 --> 00:09:01,170
The start...

323
00:09:01,170 --> 00:09:03,940
ALRIGHHTT!!

324
00:09:05,970 --> 00:09:08,540
Absolutely No Laughing American Police 24HRS

325
00:09:09,440 --> 00:09:11,350
He's laughing!!

326
00:09:12,700 --> 00:09:14,980
These guys are dirty!

327
00:09:14,580 --> 00:09:15,450
I'm safe if I get off the bus!!

328
00:09:15,450 --> 00:09:18,250
Isn't this a safety zone!?

329
00:09:16,900 --> 00:09:19,180
You can't get off the bus!

330
00:09:17,760 --> 00:09:19,180
You were on it!

331
00:09:19,180 --> 00:09:21,220
Seriously listen to me...

332
00:09:21,220 --> 00:09:23,600
Once I looked outside from in there...

333
00:09:23,600 --> 00:09:25,560
All I saw was a black guy laughing

334
00:09:25,560 --> 00:09:27,600
What kind of scene is that!?

335
00:09:27,600 --> 00:09:30,460
A black guy was laughing at me outside the bus!

336
00:09:30,800 --> 00:09:33,330
With you like this it's impossible...

337
00:09:33,330 --> 00:09:35,000
Just get in there before us... I can't be the first.

338
00:09:35,000 --> 00:09:37,510
Just get in there before us... I can't be the first.

339
00:09:35,380 --> 00:09:37,510
Please get on first!

340
00:09:37,420 --> 00:09:39,180
That'll help.

341
00:09:38,040 --> 00:09:39,160
Yeah.

342
00:09:41,840 --> 00:09:44,350
This bus...

343
00:09:43,760 --> 00:09:44,700
No good.

344
00:09:45,150 --> 00:09:47,720
This is impossible.

345
00:09:47,720 --> 00:09:49,220
He's laughing!

346
00:09:48,480 --> 00:09:49,350
Ah! He laughed!

347
00:09:49,350 --> 00:09:53,320
You've been laughing this whole time!

348
00:09:53,340 --> 00:09:55,700
I held it in till I got off the bus

349
00:09:55,720 --> 00:09:57,300
He's here!

350
00:09:58,160 --> 00:09:59,840
You were laughing!

351
00:09:59,820 --> 00:10:01,660
Alright!

352
00:10:01,000 --> 00:10:02,120
The first smack!

353
00:10:02,020 --> 00:10:06,330
smack their butts

354
00:10:02,020 --> 00:10:06,330
Black Army Corps will

355
00:10:02,110 --> 00:10:03,400
It's the first smack

356
00:10:03,460 --> 00:10:04,880
Nice hit!

357
00:10:04,650 --> 00:10:06,010
Wow, that was a nice one.

358
00:10:05,400 --> 00:10:07,230
All right, everyone get on

359
00:10:07,090 --> 00:10:09,430
Please stop with that expression too

360
00:10:08,480 --> 00:10:10,660
That grim expression

361
00:10:10,960 --> 00:10:12,820
Oh no, it's hard not to laugh
at this expression he has on....

362
00:10:12,830 --> 00:10:14,430
This facial expression...

363
00:10:14,570 --> 00:10:16,430
Seriously...

364
00:10:15,680 --> 00:10:16,590
What...

365
00:10:16,640 --> 00:10:19,140
What's with that?

366
00:10:19,140 --> 00:10:23,980
T/N: Emmanuel Lewis an American actor known for starring in Webster. Matsuko DX cosplayed as Emmanuel back in EDF

367
00:10:19,140 --> 00:10:23,980
You look like Emmanuel

368
00:10:21,450 --> 00:10:22,820
That works too

369
00:10:23,320 --> 00:10:24,240
Please stop with that.

370
00:10:23,990 --> 00:10:25,880
Let's just hurry on board

371
00:10:25,440 --> 00:10:26,440
Okay, sorry.

372
00:10:27,080 --> 00:10:30,420
I'm getting on~

373
00:10:29,440 --> 00:10:30,360
Wah, we're on

374
00:10:30,450 --> 00:10:31,680
In our usual seats

375
00:10:31,680 --> 00:10:32,220
Okay

376
00:10:32,220 --> 00:10:33,220
Yeah, our usual seats

377
00:10:37,180 --> 00:10:39,470
It looks to me like Hamada's already laughing...

378
00:10:37,890 --> 00:10:41,700
Normal passengers are already on board

379
00:10:40,260 --> 00:10:41,730
Wow

380
00:10:40,670 --> 00:10:41,510
It's finally started

381
00:10:41,890 --> 00:10:49,670
Departure towards the Police Department, What lies ahead?!

382
00:10:42,720 --> 00:10:45,710
The bus finally departs for the Police Department.

383
00:10:46,560 --> 00:10:49,580
What awaits them there?

384
00:10:50,200 --> 00:10:54,540
There could be a pattern where no one who comes on board knows who he is

385
00:10:53,560 --> 00:10:55,230
"Huh? Where's Hamada today?"

386
00:10:54,580 --> 00:10:55,690
...Plus

387
00:10:55,900 --> 00:10:58,220
Um...the people who come on board...

388
00:10:57,840 --> 00:10:58,960
The people who come to make us laugh

389
00:10:58,550 --> 00:11:00,920
The people who come to make us laugh might laugh instead when they see Hamada !!!!!

390
00:11:00,920 --> 00:11:02,580
The people who come to make us laugh might laugh instead when they see Hamada !!!!!

391
00:11:03,100 --> 00:11:07,090
Mfufufu...

392
00:11:06,300 --> 00:11:07,880
You're not allowed to laugh

393
00:11:08,820 --> 00:11:10,260
He's laughing

394
00:11:08,890 --> 00:11:10,290
Laughing isn't allowed

395
00:11:09,810 --> 00:11:10,890
Yeah, seriously

396
00:11:10,260 --> 00:11:11,930
You were making some sound

397
00:11:12,160 --> 00:11:14,560
He laughed like he was really blissful

398
00:11:14,560 --> 00:11:16,850
He laughed like he was really blissful

399
00:11:16,850 --> 00:11:19,370
Right?

400
00:11:20,100 --> 00:11:21,990
Terrible

401
00:11:23,410 --> 00:11:25,000
What's with that "Right?" ?

402
00:11:24,880 --> 00:11:28,590
Well, of course, it's "no laughing"

403
00:11:30,230 --> 00:11:31,690
How many years have we been doing this?

404
00:11:31,410 --> 00:11:35,420
You were totally enjoying yourself

405
00:11:33,850 --> 00:11:35,370
Um... Sorry.

406
00:11:35,420 --> 00:11:39,390
Laughing is no longer allowed

407
00:11:36,310 --> 00:11:39,870
On top of the 5 no longer being allowed to laugh,

408
00:11:39,400 --> 00:11:43,790
The rampage of Hamada's destructive power

409
00:11:39,870 --> 00:11:43,210
they are faced with the rampage of Hamada's destructive power

410
00:11:42,280 --> 00:11:43,660
Why the hell

411
00:11:43,550 --> 00:11:45,150
So destructive

412
00:11:44,030 --> 00:11:49,890
However, the assassins of comedy will beckon the 5 into more hellish situations

413
00:11:44,160 --> 00:11:51,830
However, the assassins of comedy will

414
00:11:44,160 --> 00:11:51,830
beckon the 5 into more hellish situations

415
00:11:52,300 --> 00:11:56,840
Reached a bus stop

416
00:11:55,310 --> 00:11:56,950
Oh, it's this part...

417
00:11:56,970 --> 00:11:58,260
One-two...

418
00:11:58,010 --> 00:11:59,530
Ah, it feels so cool

419
00:11:58,670 --> 00:12:00,400
One-two...

420
00:11:59,130 --> 00:12:00,430
It does feel quite cool

421
00:11:59,400 --> 00:12:00,450
*Baby noises*

422
00:12:00,620 --> 00:12:03,150
And a one-two, good...

423
00:12:03,440 --> 00:12:04,970
All right...

424
00:12:05,290 --> 00:12:07,670
Careful. There are steps here.

425
00:12:06,580 --> 00:12:11,490
Akiyama Ryuuji

426
00:12:06,580 --> 00:12:11,490
Baby

427
00:12:07,780 --> 00:12:09,440
There are steps here

428
00:12:10,670 --> 00:12:12,200
There are steps here

429
00:12:11,050 --> 00:12:12,280
One-two...

430
00:12:12,560 --> 00:12:15,250
One-two, one-two

431
00:12:15,460 --> 00:12:16,660
Shall we sit here?

432
00:12:15,660 --> 00:12:17,190
There are steps here

433
00:12:17,190 --> 00:12:20,030
There are steps here

434
00:12:19,990 --> 00:12:20,710
Okay...

435
00:12:22,790 --> 00:12:24,060
There are steps here

436
00:12:25,020 --> 00:12:26,690
It's your fault, Akiyama

437
00:12:25,370 --> 00:12:27,440
Babies won't say things so clearly

438
00:12:28,410 --> 00:12:29,980
No way babies can talk like that

439
00:12:29,470 --> 00:12:30,540
Babies usually won't say such things

440
00:12:30,540 --> 00:12:33,410
Babies usually won't say such things

441
00:12:32,330 --> 00:12:33,500
Babies can't talk

442
00:12:33,410 --> 00:12:36,640
There are steps here

443
00:12:36,640 --> 00:12:40,180
Mama

444
00:12:36,640 --> 00:12:40,180
Okina Megumi

445
00:12:40,180 --> 00:12:42,480
So warm

446
00:12:40,800 --> 00:12:42,900
Yes, you do seem rather warm. Shall we have you unbutton your clothes?

447
00:12:42,500 --> 00:12:44,150
I feel really warm!!

448
00:12:45,680 --> 00:12:46,950
He said that really clearly

449
00:12:46,990 --> 00:12:49,290
His skin's really tanned

450
00:12:50,360 --> 00:12:52,330
Noo-noos...

451
00:12:50,360 --> 00:12:52,330
T/N: Churuchuru is baby talk for noodles in Japanese.

452
00:12:50,400 --> 00:12:52,210
Noo-noos?

453
00:12:52,330 --> 00:12:56,260
You want to eat noo-noos?

454
00:12:53,270 --> 00:12:56,260
Okay, let's eat some noo-noos~

455
00:12:56,260 --> 00:13:00,770
Loves noodles even though he's a baby

456
00:12:56,260 --> 00:13:00,770
Ryuu-chan's demand

457
00:12:56,780 --> 00:12:57,630
Isn't it too early for him?

458
00:12:57,360 --> 00:12:59,300
Still early right?

459
00:12:57,780 --> 00:12:58,620
Yeah

460
00:12:58,670 --> 00:12:59,870
He's still a baby isn't he?

461
00:13:00,430 --> 00:13:02,300
I think it's a bad idea

462
00:13:02,050 --> 00:13:03,710
He's going to eat

463
00:13:02,050 --> 00:13:04,710
T/N: The face on the bib is of Umemiya Tatsuo, Japanese actor. He has appeared many times in previous No-Laughing specials

464
00:13:13,180 --> 00:13:14,730
You're gonna get scolded by him

465
00:13:14,500 --> 00:13:15,830
Totally a terrible idea

466
00:13:15,560 --> 00:13:17,350
You're going to get a scolding

467
00:13:15,990 --> 00:13:17,430
He'll get mad

468
00:13:23,950 --> 00:13:25,690
Rather than Akiyama...

469
00:13:25,690 --> 00:13:29,930
Okina will get a scolding too

470
00:13:26,960 --> 00:13:28,860
Yeah, really

471
00:13:28,640 --> 00:13:29,870
Was it yummy?

472
00:13:29,480 --> 00:13:30,420
Yum, yum

473
00:13:30,420 --> 00:13:31,090
Say "ahh"

474
00:13:31,090 --> 00:13:33,280
So much

475
00:13:31,330 --> 00:13:33,070
That's a lot

476
00:13:32,000 --> 00:13:33,240
Stuffing that much...

477
00:13:33,860 --> 00:13:35,590
Wow she did it

478
00:13:34,540 --> 00:13:36,060
Is it okay to be doing this?

479
00:13:36,040 --> 00:13:37,480
You have to eat a lot...

480
00:13:36,200 --> 00:13:38,270
That amount seems impossible

481
00:13:44,680 --> 00:13:47,150
That's really too much noodles!!

482
00:13:45,870 --> 00:13:47,040
Of course that would happen!

483
00:13:47,680 --> 00:13:48,470
Too much

484
00:13:48,860 --> 00:13:51,210
I think even Umemiya would find it impossible to eat that amount of noodles at the same time.

485
00:13:54,920 --> 00:13:56,270
It spilled...

486
00:13:59,880 --> 00:14:01,460
Not just me

487
00:14:01,510 --> 00:14:05,400
Mama should eat noo-noos too!!

488
00:14:03,360 --> 00:14:07,210
It's fine, it's fine, I don't really...

489
00:14:05,400 --> 00:14:13,210
Ryuu-chan's demand

490
00:14:05,400 --> 00:14:13,210
Wants Mama to eat noodles as well

491
00:14:06,410 --> 00:14:07,890
Mama, eat some too

492
00:14:07,210 --> 00:14:09,000
We're currently outside after all...

493
00:14:08,980 --> 00:14:10,900
You're gonna feed mama some noo-noos too

494
00:14:10,230 --> 00:14:11,780
Mama should have some noo-noos too

495
00:14:11,060 --> 00:14:12,470
Well...

496
00:14:11,790 --> 00:14:13,610
Well, sure, but you don't really have to...

497
00:14:12,810 --> 00:14:15,320
Isn't it fine if you just don't eat in the bus?

498
00:14:13,170 --> 00:14:14,670
This isn't really the right place...

499
00:14:14,600 --> 00:14:16,370
Is she okay?

500
00:14:20,020 --> 00:14:21,020
Here.

501
00:14:20,020 --> 00:14:24,020
T/N: The face on her bib is that of a female wrestler going by the stage name of Aja Kong.

502
00:14:20,280 --> 00:14:21,880
That's Aja

503
00:14:28,140 --> 00:14:29,520
Mama eat noo-noos too

504
00:14:31,020 --> 00:14:32,450
What the...

505
00:14:31,200 --> 00:14:32,570
Tanks for the good work!

506
00:14:33,630 --> 00:14:35,040
What does he mean by that?

507
00:14:34,770 --> 00:14:35,830
Don't make it painful

508
00:14:38,550 --> 00:14:41,320
She's completely different from the person on the bib, even her physique

509
00:14:40,590 --> 00:14:42,490
Completely

510
00:14:43,090 --> 00:14:43,720
Let's go back

511
00:14:44,070 --> 00:14:46,100
Okay, one-two~

512
00:14:44,070 --> 00:14:46,100
Okay, one-two~

513
00:14:46,450 --> 00:14:47,810
There are steps here

514
00:14:46,470 --> 00:14:48,570
Yes, there are steps

515
00:14:48,050 --> 00:14:48,990
There are steps here

516
00:14:48,640 --> 00:14:49,770
Yes, there are steps

517
00:14:49,960 --> 00:14:51,880
Achoo!!

518
00:14:55,030 --> 00:14:57,320
Achoo!!

519
00:14:57,480 --> 00:14:58,190
You... That was really terrible

520
00:14:58,190 --> 00:15:00,320
You... That was really terrible

521
00:15:03,170 --> 00:15:05,970
Yeah

522
00:15:04,460 --> 00:15:06,230
Stop this guy

523
00:15:06,000 --> 00:15:07,760
Sneezing like that, what the hell?

524
00:15:07,760 --> 00:15:10,630
I've never seen that kind of sneeze before!

525
00:15:09,450 --> 00:15:11,720
The sneezes just came out. I couldn't help it.

526
00:15:10,680 --> 00:15:12,890
Because you don't normally look like this

527
00:15:12,300 --> 00:15:15,500
What's with that schwiiing sound huh?

528
00:15:15,760 --> 00:15:16,710
This guy's really...

529
00:15:15,990 --> 00:15:17,790
Ah, me too

530
00:15:17,640 --> 00:15:18,920
Seriously...

531
00:15:20,000 --> 00:15:21,110
Just show me a normal sneeze

532
00:15:21,110 --> 00:15:22,080
This costume, plus the sneeze is unbearable

533
00:15:22,080 --> 00:15:23,910
This costume, plus the sneeze is unbearable

534
00:15:24,290 --> 00:15:32,490
The bus has reached the next assassin's location

535
00:15:24,290 --> 00:15:32,490
While the 5 were making each other laugh,

536
00:15:24,830 --> 00:15:27,380
The 5 are making each other laugh

537
00:15:27,380 --> 00:15:31,690
During that time, the bus has reached the next assassin's location

538
00:15:33,250 --> 00:15:35,820
Are we going to stop again?

539
00:15:34,760 --> 00:15:35,870
Are we there yet?

540
00:15:35,890 --> 00:15:42,000
Reached a bus stop

541
00:15:47,100 --> 00:15:52,770
Host

542
00:15:47,100 --> 00:15:52,770
Host

543
00:15:47,100 --> 00:15:52,770
Wakabayashi Masayasu

544
00:15:47,100 --> 00:15:52,770
Yamazaki Kento

545
00:15:50,240 --> 00:15:51,340
Hey, Eito

546
00:15:50,240 --> 00:15:54,410
T/N: In his new drama "Todome no Kiss", Yamazaki Kento is playing a character working as a host who goes by the professional name Eito.

547
00:15:51,340 --> 00:15:53,140
The other day,

548
00:15:53,140 --> 00:15:54,410
You were with that showy woman

549
00:15:54,410 --> 00:15:56,910
You were with that showy woman

550
00:15:55,810 --> 00:15:56,910
Who was she?

551
00:15:56,910 --> 00:15:57,610
That woman is entry number 19

552
00:15:57,610 --> 00:15:59,450
That woman is entry number 19

553
00:15:59,450 --> 00:16:01,050
The CEO of an apparel company

554
00:16:01,050 --> 00:16:02,780
Her company earns 3 billion yen annually. She's a great source of income

555
00:16:04,220 --> 00:16:06,750
As expected of the the No.1 in our Host Club, Eito

556
00:16:07,290 --> 00:16:08,250
But recently...

557
00:16:08,260 --> 00:16:10,320
You've been troubled by a strange woman following you around right?

558
00:16:10,320 --> 00:16:11,330
You've been troubled by a strange woman following you around right?

559
00:16:11,490 --> 00:16:12,560
She suddenly appeared and tried to kiss me

560
00:16:12,560 --> 00:16:16,250
She suddenly appeared and tried to kiss me

561
00:16:14,240 --> 00:16:16,850
What, so you're boasting now

562
00:16:16,220 --> 00:16:17,140
No, that's not it

563
00:16:17,140 --> 00:16:18,110
That woman's serious trouble!

564
00:16:18,110 --> 00:16:20,180
I'll die if she kisses me

565
00:16:20,530 --> 00:16:27,470
Being chased by a mysterious woman with a murderous kiss

566
00:16:20,530 --> 00:16:27,470
No.1 Host's troubles

567
00:16:20,880 --> 00:16:22,290
Such a woman exists?

568
00:16:22,050 --> 00:16:22,540
Yeah

569
00:16:23,540 --> 00:16:25,000
Sounds terrible...

570
00:16:28,200 --> 00:16:28,920
Hey, Eito

571
00:16:28,980 --> 00:16:32,710
Kadowaki Mugi

572
00:16:28,980 --> 00:16:32,710
Mysterious woman

573
00:16:29,190 --> 00:16:30,210
Who's this?

574
00:16:30,340 --> 00:16:32,560
She's here! She's the kissing woman I was talking about

575
00:16:33,280 --> 00:16:35,050
You will die

576
00:16:35,130 --> 00:16:35,970
Stop!

577
00:16:35,140 --> 00:16:36,480
Wait, wait...

578
00:16:36,950 --> 00:16:38,080
Why are you trying to kill Eito by kissing him?

579
00:16:38,080 --> 00:16:39,890
Why are you trying to kill Eito by kissing him?

580
00:16:39,760 --> 00:16:42,550
There are other people in the world who are better off dead

581
00:16:43,060 --> 00:16:47,930
There are trash who would be better off dead in the world

582
00:16:43,690 --> 00:16:45,270
People who would be better off dead...

583
00:16:46,870 --> 00:16:48,190
Like this guy.

584
00:16:48,760 --> 00:16:49,860
That's right. This guy

585
00:16:49,860 --> 00:16:51,170
That's right. This guy

586
00:16:51,170 --> 00:16:51,700
has an extreme idiot complex so

587
00:16:51,700 --> 00:16:53,430
has an extreme idiot complex so

588
00:16:53,430 --> 00:16:54,500
He wanted his son to enter a private school

589
00:16:54,500 --> 00:16:56,140
he wanted his son to enter a private school

590
00:16:54,500 --> 00:16:58,710
T/N: Private schools including kindergarten and elementary usually hold entrance exams for prospective students

591
00:16:56,700 --> 00:16:57,710
He tried learning English from internet videos but...

592
00:16:57,710 --> 00:16:59,170
He tried learning English from internet videos but...

593
00:16:59,540 --> 00:17:00,340
In the end, he didn't understand anything so

594
00:17:00,340 --> 00:17:02,340
In the end, he didn't understand anything so

595
00:17:02,440 --> 00:17:05,250
he just silently switched off the power

596
00:17:05,250 --> 00:17:06,380
The size of his brain

597
00:17:06,380 --> 00:17:09,520
is like the size of a pumpkin seed!!

598
00:17:09,780 --> 00:17:11,790
I know of him too. In addition, recently

599
00:17:11,790 --> 00:17:12,820
I know of him too. In addition, recently

600
00:17:12,820 --> 00:17:15,590
important job offers kept coming in only for his partner Tanaka so

601
00:17:15,590 --> 00:17:17,020
the stress of the disparity between them led him to betting on horse races

602
00:17:17,020 --> 00:17:18,290
the stress of the disparity between them led him to betting on horse races

603
00:17:18,310 --> 00:17:21,560
T/N: Currently, ¥1,000,000 equals to about $9,010 USD.

604
00:17:18,310 --> 00:17:21,560
and losing several million yen!!

605
00:17:22,870 --> 00:17:23,840
What the hell

606
00:17:23,280 --> 00:17:24,170
Eh? Betting on horse racing...?

607
00:17:24,210 --> 00:17:26,360
No, no, no

608
00:17:24,630 --> 00:17:25,800
Did you really do that?!

609
00:17:25,980 --> 00:17:26,930
I didn't!

610
00:17:26,790 --> 00:17:28,080
Don't tell me you...

611
00:17:27,830 --> 00:17:29,100
Horse racing...

612
00:17:28,840 --> 00:17:32,910
I didn't want to know

613
00:17:30,350 --> 00:17:31,540
I wouldn't lose several million yen!

614
00:17:31,540 --> 00:17:33,330
No way I'd lose money over this

615
00:17:33,820 --> 00:17:36,080
I didn't

616
00:17:37,860 --> 00:17:39,100
I didn't

617
00:17:39,300 --> 00:17:40,840
I only did a little betting

618
00:17:40,850 --> 00:17:41,780
There are other people who should be better off dead too

619
00:17:41,780 --> 00:17:45,150
There are other people who should be better off dead too

620
00:17:45,700 --> 00:17:46,710
Like that guy.

621
00:17:47,050 --> 00:17:48,020
That's right. This guy,

622
00:17:48,020 --> 00:17:48,990
That's right. This guy,

623
00:17:49,320 --> 00:17:52,330
to pray for the success of the Tsukitei Hosei solo recital

624
00:17:52,330 --> 00:17:54,230
he visited a shrine and at that time

625
00:17:54,460 --> 00:17:56,160
he tried to receive power from a 400 year old sacred tree

626
00:17:56,160 --> 00:17:57,260
he tried to receive power from a 400 year old sacred tree

627
00:17:57,260 --> 00:17:59,070
The moment this man hugged it,

628
00:17:59,070 --> 00:18:02,200
sudden strong rain porridged down on him

629
00:18:03,170 --> 00:18:04,510
It's okay. Isn't that right?

630
00:18:03,610 --> 00:18:05,650
A little...

631
00:18:04,510 --> 00:18:05,870
It's okay. Isn't that right?

632
00:18:05,870 --> 00:18:07,440
It poured down on him. The sudden strong rain.

633
00:18:07,440 --> 00:18:09,940
It poured down on him. The sudden strong rain.

634
00:18:09,940 --> 00:18:11,480
I know of him too. In addition, this guy

635
00:18:11,480 --> 00:18:12,510
I know of him too. In addition, this guy

636
00:18:12,510 --> 00:18:14,050
Last year, even though his company found out and was mad,

637
00:18:14,050 --> 00:18:16,980
he still continued producing and selling shady goods

638
00:18:16,980 --> 00:18:18,820
And this time, in the style of Yazawa Eikichi,

639
00:18:16,980 --> 00:18:18,820
T/N: Yazawa Eikichi is a Japanese singer and songwriter who had a strong influence on Japanese rock music

640
00:18:18,830 --> 00:18:22,690
he made Tsukitei Hosei scarf towels!!

641
00:18:20,920 --> 00:18:22,080
Who would buy those towels?!

642
00:18:25,020 --> 00:18:27,400
What's more, it seems there were a lot of leftover stock

643
00:18:27,160 --> 00:18:28,640
Shady goods...

644
00:18:28,170 --> 00:18:29,890
I think you should stop doing it

645
00:18:30,310 --> 00:18:31,240
Just drop it

646
00:18:30,340 --> 00:18:31,600
Don't you think so?

647
00:18:31,690 --> 00:18:32,690
So despicable...

648
00:18:32,100 --> 00:18:33,660
You were able to say it

649
00:18:34,670 --> 00:18:36,100
You've already been exposed, seriously.

650
00:18:36,400 --> 00:18:38,770
Kento, pull yourself together

651
00:18:38,890 --> 00:18:39,770
I just...

652
00:18:39,620 --> 00:18:40,570
Just...

653
00:18:39,770 --> 00:18:41,540
I wanted to hear the line about the sudden strong rain properly

654
00:18:41,540 --> 00:18:45,250
I wanted to hear the line about the sudden strong rain properly

655
00:18:42,800 --> 00:18:43,920
It's all right

656
00:18:45,680 --> 00:18:46,110
There are other people who should be better off dead too

657
00:18:46,110 --> 00:18:49,550
There are other people who should be better off dead too

658
00:18:49,670 --> 00:18:50,660
Like this guy

659
00:18:51,550 --> 00:18:53,110
Yeah, that's right.

660
00:18:53,520 --> 00:18:54,690
This guy...

661
00:18:54,690 --> 00:18:57,590
When he and his wife brought juniors out to eat,

662
00:18:57,590 --> 00:18:59,930
at the time of payment, they would

663
00:18:59,930 --> 00:19:02,500
argue over which of them would be the one to pay.

664
00:19:02,500 --> 00:19:03,760
Thus, such a mini skit would start

665
00:19:04,130 --> 00:19:04,870
At the longest, it would go on and on for around 20 minutes

666
00:19:04,870 --> 00:19:06,870
At the longest, it would go on and on for around 20 minutes

667
00:19:06,630 --> 00:19:07,670
How lame

668
00:19:06,870 --> 00:19:11,470
He's a man using these mini skits to appeal that he has a good relationship with his wife!!

669
00:19:11,470 --> 00:19:13,010
I know of him too.

670
00:19:13,060 --> 00:19:17,610
In addition, this guy's recently been... fufufu

671
00:19:18,480 --> 00:19:21,750
You're affecting her after all

672
00:19:19,930 --> 00:19:21,820
It's affecting her

673
00:19:21,850 --> 00:19:23,990
This is way too intense

674
00:19:22,380 --> 00:19:25,350
She became unable to do her job

675
00:19:24,850 --> 00:19:26,330
Saying the line again right?

676
00:19:25,350 --> 00:19:26,990
In addition, this guy's recently been deteriorating fast due to age

677
00:19:26,990 --> 00:19:28,320
In addition, this guy's recently been deteriorating fast due to age

678
00:19:28,320 --> 00:19:29,260
When he brought his juniors to

679
00:19:29,260 --> 00:19:31,190
a power spot deep in the mountains,

680
00:19:31,190 --> 00:19:33,460
He left his mobile phone there and forgot about it

681
00:19:33,460 --> 00:19:37,930
so he had to return to the power spot to retrieve it!!

682
00:19:35,280 --> 00:19:36,230
So lame

683
00:19:37,930 --> 00:19:40,470
You're such a grandpa!!

684
00:19:40,810 --> 00:19:41,910
How terrible

685
00:19:42,550 --> 00:19:45,770
Why did you accidentally leave your mobile at the power spot?

686
00:19:55,150 --> 00:19:55,650
There are other people who should be better off dead too

687
00:19:55,650 --> 00:19:59,220
There are other people who should be better off dead too

688
00:19:59,490 --> 00:20:00,480
Like this guy.

689
00:20:00,850 --> 00:20:02,890
Yeah, this dude.

690
00:20:02,890 --> 00:20:04,060
This summer he went to Disneyland

691
00:20:04,060 --> 00:20:05,930
This summer he went to Disneyland

692
00:20:05,930 --> 00:20:11,720
His daughter asked him to carry her backpack

693
00:20:08,140 --> 00:20:11,720
...

694
00:20:09,860 --> 00:20:11,140
You got this, man.

695
00:20:11,140 --> 00:20:11,740
Try again

696
00:20:11,720 --> 00:20:15,870
His daughter asked him to carry her backpack...

697
00:20:12,650 --> 00:20:15,870
His daughter asked him to carry her backpack...

698
00:20:15,870 --> 00:20:18,500
This one's gonna be good

699
00:20:19,010 --> 00:20:19,420
Say it right!

700
00:20:19,420 --> 00:20:20,410
You can do it.

701
00:20:20,410 --> 00:20:23,470
One more time from the top

702
00:20:21,970 --> 00:20:22,770
Alright

703
00:20:22,770 --> 00:20:24,480
Don't let those guys freak you out

704
00:20:24,480 --> 00:20:26,280
Just spit it out!

705
00:20:25,730 --> 00:20:27,550
Come on, I believe you can do it

706
00:20:26,280 --> 00:20:27,670
At least get my part right!

707
00:20:28,320 --> 00:20:29,200
Right, him!

708
00:20:29,200 --> 00:20:30,250
This guy...

709
00:20:30,250 --> 00:20:31,320
This summer he went to Disneyland

710
00:20:31,320 --> 00:20:32,740
This summer he went to Disneyland

711
00:20:32,740 --> 00:20:33,350
His daughter usk- asked him to carry her backpack...

712
00:20:33,350 --> 00:20:33,690
His daughter usk- asked him to carry her backpack...

713
00:20:33,690 --> 00:20:37,810
His daughter usk- asked him to carry her backpack...

714
00:20:38,450 --> 00:20:39,790
Messed up his line again

715
00:20:39,790 --> 00:20:41,060
So this really buff old man

716
00:20:41,060 --> 00:20:42,630
So this really buff old man

717
00:20:42,630 --> 00:20:44,400
In a shirt five sizes too small

718
00:20:45,070 --> 00:20:48,290
Walking around while carrying

719
00:20:46,570 --> 00:20:48,290
a REALLY GIRLY backpack

720
00:20:48,290 --> 00:20:52,210
he really was a muscle-brained idiot of a father!!

721
00:20:52,210 --> 00:20:54,160
I know of this as well.

722
00:20:55,640 --> 00:20:57,440
We have a picture of him at Disneyland

723
00:20:59,380 --> 00:21:02,240
Isn't that just a pervert?!

724
00:21:02,280 --> 00:21:03,320
Now that's scary

725
00:21:04,550 --> 00:21:05,190
You're kidding!

726
00:21:05,190 --> 00:21:06,550
This one is a fake right?

727
00:21:06,550 --> 00:21:07,290
No, listen!

728
00:21:07,290 --> 00:21:09,680
Things like this happen from time to time!

729
00:21:09,330 --> 00:21:10,770
That's just messed up...

730
00:21:10,770 --> 00:21:13,660
That entire situation is pretty messed up.

731
00:21:13,660 --> 00:21:16,950
I'm stunned!

732
00:21:15,010 --> 00:21:15,920
Ouch

733
00:21:15,920 --> 00:21:16,860
N-no!

734
00:21:16,860 --> 00:21:17,930
Shocking.

735
00:21:18,860 --> 00:21:20,450
I can't take it, let's bail!

736
00:21:26,740 --> 00:21:28,700
No, uh, take that with you please!

737
00:21:28,130 --> 00:21:29,350
Why leave it?

738
00:21:29,880 --> 00:21:31,270
I look like pretty soft here

739
00:21:31,350 --> 00:21:34,240
It's only been one hour

740
00:21:35,200 --> 00:21:41,040
An endless onslaught of punishments

741
00:21:35,200 --> 00:21:41,040
keeps them on their toes

742
00:21:41,320 --> 00:21:46,880
But those waiting in ambush

743
00:21:41,320 --> 00:21:46,880
will not go easy on our 5 members!

744
00:21:48,200 --> 00:21:53,590
We arrive at the next stop

745
00:21:50,320 --> 00:21:51,940
Here we go

746
00:21:51,360 --> 00:21:51,940
Oh boy

747
00:21:51,940 --> 00:21:52,820
Wait what

748
00:21:52,820 --> 00:21:53,870
Oh right!

749
00:21:53,870 --> 00:21:55,660
It's this bit...

750
00:21:57,100 --> 00:22:00,830
It's a standing mic?

751
00:22:03,930 --> 00:22:06,410
Since the beginning we've had a clear goal

752
00:22:06,410 --> 00:22:09,440
Since the beginning we've had a clear goal

753
00:22:06,410 --> 00:22:09,440
Since the beginning we've had a clear goal

754
00:22:09,720 --> 00:22:13,540
We would follow in Downtown's footsteps.

755
00:22:13,590 --> 00:22:18,080
And at last we've managed to seize this one opportunity!

756
00:22:16,390 --> 00:22:18,080
Doesn't he sound like the voice from Project X?

757
00:22:16,390 --> 00:22:18,080
Translator's Note: Project X was an NHK documentary series

758
00:22:18,240 --> 00:22:23,390
We've used a natural airhead

759
00:22:23,420 --> 00:22:27,660
We were able to use funny costume routines as a punchline

760
00:22:28,010 --> 00:22:31,730
But alas, we realized something.

761
00:22:31,810 --> 00:22:35,170
Our pride as a manzai duo.

762
00:22:35,180 --> 00:22:39,540
As long as we have one standing microphone

763
00:22:39,600 --> 00:22:42,640
nothing else matters.

764
00:22:42,680 --> 00:22:45,220
That said, can we even make them laugh?

765
00:22:45,220 --> 00:22:48,760
That said, can we even make them laugh?

766
00:22:45,220 --> 00:22:48,760
That said, can we even make them laugh?

767
00:22:49,500 --> 00:22:53,210
Enter the duo: "Chidori"

768
00:22:54,820 --> 00:22:59,200
Helloooooo!

769
00:22:59,200 --> 00:23:00,780
How are you

770
00:23:00,050 --> 00:23:00,780
Good morning!

771
00:23:01,180 --> 00:23:02,720
This is amazing

772
00:23:02,160 --> 00:23:02,720
Okay, so

773
00:23:02,720 --> 00:23:03,100
Alright?

774
00:23:02,720 --> 00:23:05,440
I've got a scary story to tell.

775
00:23:04,170 --> 00:23:10,930
Chidori

776
00:23:04,170 --> 00:23:10,930
Daigo . Nobu

777
00:23:05,440 --> 00:23:07,140
A scary story, you say?

778
00:23:07,140 --> 00:23:09,850
Yeah, I had to go to Kyushu for a job, right?

779
00:23:09,220 --> 00:23:10,670
Kyushu eh?

780
00:23:09,850 --> 00:23:11,680
So, turns out I have to stay overnight

781
00:23:10,960 --> 00:23:11,840
I see.

782
00:23:11,680 --> 00:23:13,490
So I booked a room at this hotel,

783
00:23:13,490 --> 00:23:16,420
The place was completely run-down.

784
00:23:15,060 --> 00:23:17,040
That's pretty creepy.

785
00:23:16,420 --> 00:23:17,960
Well, what can you do?

786
00:23:17,960 --> 00:23:20,350
So the doors opened like this.

787
00:23:18,900 --> 00:23:20,350
Wait, were you in a spaceship?

788
00:23:22,290 --> 00:23:23,950
Are you a spaceship crew member?

789
00:23:24,560 --> 00:23:26,260
Are aliens stuck to you??

790
00:23:26,260 --> 00:23:29,930
So I went to the hotel lobby and got my room key from Dracula

791
00:23:29,930 --> 00:23:31,710
Oh my, it's Dracula?!

792
00:23:31,710 --> 00:23:34,210
There's no freaking way Dracula would show up!

793
00:23:34,210 --> 00:23:35,300
Creeeeeak

794
00:23:35,300 --> 00:23:37,010
Just forget the sound effects.

795
00:23:37,010 --> 00:23:39,500
So the moment I entered the room, well, I'm sure all of you get this feeling sometimes

796
00:23:39,500 --> 00:23:41,180
But even though this room is supposed to be empty,

797
00:23:41,180 --> 00:23:43,030
I felt someone's presence.

798
00:23:42,260 --> 00:23:43,640
Pretty disgusting feeling.

799
00:23:43,030 --> 00:23:45,520
Yeah, I was disgusted and tired, so I just wanted to sleep.

800
00:23:45,050 --> 00:23:46,250
Right, sleep.

801
00:23:45,520 --> 00:23:47,460
So I pushed aside the person on the bed.

802
00:23:47,460 --> 00:23:49,200
Another mysterious being?

803
00:23:49,200 --> 00:23:50,900
This is the second one!

804
00:23:50,900 --> 00:23:52,870
So an hour passed

805
00:23:52,870 --> 00:23:53,530
BOOM!

806
00:23:53,530 --> 00:23:54,300
What happened?!

807
00:23:54,300 --> 00:23:55,510
I was suddenly paralyzed!

808
00:23:54,970 --> 00:23:55,510
Paralyzed?!

809
00:23:55,510 --> 00:23:57,060
I couldn't move at all!

810
00:23:57,060 --> 00:23:58,000
I could only look around like, stare.

811
00:23:58,000 --> 00:23:58,240
I could only look around like, stare, stare.

812
00:23:58,240 --> 00:23:58,580
I could only look around like, stare, stare, stare.

813
00:23:58,580 --> 00:23:58,840
I could only look around like, stare, stare, stare. stare.

814
00:23:58,840 --> 00:23:59,090
I could only look around like, stare, stare, stare. stare, stare.

815
00:23:59,090 --> 00:23:59,520
I could only look around like, stare, stare, stare. stare, stare, stare.

816
00:23:59,520 --> 00:23:59,770
I could only look around like, stare, stare, stare. stare, stare, stare.
stare.

817
00:23:59,770 --> 00:24:00,100
I could only look around like, stare, stare, stare. stare, stare, stare.
stare, stare.

818
00:24:00,100 --> 00:24:00,340
I could only look around like, stare, stare, stare. stare, stare, stare.
stare, stare. It's stare.

819
00:24:00,340 --> 00:24:00,560
I could only look around like, stare, stare, stare. stare, stare, stare.
stare, stare. It's stare, stare.

820
00:24:00,560 --> 00:24:00,810
I could only look around like, stare, stare, stare. stare, stare, stare.
stare, stare. It's stare, stare, stare.

821
00:24:00,810 --> 00:24:01,040
I could only look around like, stare, stare, stare. stare, stare, stare.
stare, stare. It's stare, stare, stare, stare.

822
00:24:01,040 --> 00:24:01,290
I could only look around like, stare, stare, stare. stare, stare, stare.
stare, stare. It's stare, stare, stare, stare, stare.

823
00:24:01,290 --> 00:24:01,990
I could only look around like, stare, stare, stare. stare, stare, stare.
stare, stare. It's stare, stare, stare, stare, stare, and stare.

824
00:24:01,990 --> 00:24:03,380
We get the point!

825
00:24:03,380 --> 00:24:04,650
Just say it 2 times!

826
00:24:04,650 --> 00:24:06,110
He was right in front of my face.

827
00:24:05,390 --> 00:24:06,110
What the hell.

828
00:24:06,110 --> 00:24:06,800
It was A GHOST

829
00:24:06,800 --> 00:24:08,450
What do you mean a ghost?

830
00:24:07,660 --> 00:24:08,800
What do you mean?

831
00:24:08,450 --> 00:24:10,860
So a ghost with like the white triangle headband and all?

832
00:24:08,450 --> 00:24:12,090
T/N: Japanese ghosts are depicted with a white triangle cloth on their forehead due to ancient burial rituals for the deceased.

833
00:24:10,860 --> 00:24:12,090
That was the dude who was on the bed.

834
00:24:12,090 --> 00:24:13,010
That "dude" was a ghost!

835
00:24:13,010 --> 00:24:16,460
Whatever, in any case it was this pitch black monstrosity!

836
00:24:16,460 --> 00:24:20,960
But upon closer inspection in certain areas, it was solid black!

837
00:24:19,980 --> 00:24:21,570
So it was just black?!

838
00:24:20,960 --> 00:24:25,230
So it suddenly came towards me and disappeared right as it hit my face!

839
00:24:25,230 --> 00:24:28,510
But before disappearing, it whispered right into my ear:

840
00:24:28,510 --> 00:24:30,770
@#$%&!

841
00:24:30,770 --> 00:24:32,670
What the hell does that mean?!

842
00:24:33,890 --> 00:24:36,260
I legitimately didn't understand that!

843
00:24:36,260 --> 00:24:40,550
It was so scary that I just lay paralyzed for an hour and five minutes

844
00:24:36,760 --> 00:24:38,560
That's the important part

845
00:24:39,520 --> 00:24:40,550
Just say "an hour"

846
00:24:40,550 --> 00:24:41,360
Snap!

847
00:24:41,010 --> 00:24:41,360
What?

848
00:24:41,360 --> 00:24:42,760
Paralyzed again.

849
00:24:41,960 --> 00:24:42,760
Oh that's scary.

850
00:24:42,760 --> 00:24:44,660
The guy started talking to me

851
00:24:43,970 --> 00:24:44,660
What guy?

852
00:24:44,660 --> 00:24:45,880
With a sickle in his right hand.

853
00:24:45,490 --> 00:24:45,880
Right..

854
00:24:45,880 --> 00:24:47,440
And some rice in his left.

855
00:24:46,800 --> 00:24:48,200
So just a farmer?!

856
00:24:47,440 --> 00:24:50,530
Yeah, so the farmer rushed at me and disappeared the same way!

857
00:24:50,530 --> 00:24:54,410
But again, before disappearing he clearly said right into my ear:

858
00:24:54,410 --> 00:24:57,280
@#$%!^*)!&!

859
00:24:57,280 --> 00:24:59,170
I didn't understand that either!

860
00:24:59,170 --> 00:24:59,850
Just stop!

861
00:24:59,850 --> 00:25:00,350
And thank you very much!

862
00:24:59,850 --> 00:25:00,350
And thank you very much!

863
00:25:00,350 --> 00:25:04,350
And thank you very much!

864
00:25:00,350 --> 00:25:04,350
And thank you very much!

865
00:25:06,760 --> 00:25:09,000
They didn't laugh!

866
00:25:09,000 --> 00:25:10,350
Not even once!

867
00:25:10,350 --> 00:25:11,200
So what should I do?!

868
00:25:11,200 --> 00:25:14,430
Why did you want to accept this challenge?!

869
00:25:14,430 --> 00:25:16,370
You're the one who "wanted to do comedy"

870
00:25:16,370 --> 00:25:18,860
Oh no, I can hear them

871
00:25:17,340 --> 00:25:18,290
Could you please stop?

872
00:25:18,290 --> 00:25:20,440
What're we gonna do, it's the end of the damn year!

873
00:25:20,440 --> 00:25:23,470
This is the same as "the death of another comedy joke"

874
00:25:23,680 --> 00:25:26,900
C'mon, no one can pull it off

875
00:25:24,580 --> 00:25:26,900
with some Eddy Murphy look-alike around!

876
00:25:28,350 --> 00:25:30,470
Because he laughed.

877
00:25:28,450 --> 00:25:34,520
Even though they've all laughed, please enjoy the routine

878
00:25:30,420 --> 00:25:32,330
comment

879
00:25:31,080 --> 00:25:34,520
You're supposed to be the straight man, but you're slow!

880
00:25:33,820 --> 00:25:34,520
You're supposed to be the straight man, but you're slow!

881
00:25:34,520 --> 00:25:36,220
No way man, I did it right!

882
00:25:36,220 --> 00:25:37,090
But they didn't laugh!

883
00:25:37,090 --> 00:25:38,390
Don't interrupt me as if they're enjoying the joke!

884
00:25:38,390 --> 00:25:40,630
Don't interrupt me as if they're enjoying the joke!

885
00:25:40,630 --> 00:25:42,750
You should comment after they've laughed!

886
00:25:42,960 --> 00:25:45,420
We can all hear you!

887
00:25:43,090 --> 00:25:44,200
What do you want me to do?!

888
00:25:44,200 --> 00:25:47,000
You should try increasing the tempo a bit!

889
00:25:46,970 --> 00:25:54,630
Nobu is way too slow to react!

890
00:25:46,970 --> 00:25:54,630
The reason they get no laughs:

891
00:25:47,000 --> 00:25:48,490
Faster?

892
00:25:47,890 --> 00:25:48,490
Yeah!

893
00:25:49,330 --> 00:25:51,370
Let's go with that then.

894
00:25:49,750 --> 00:25:51,370
Just, like, go faster

895
00:25:51,370 --> 00:25:53,830
Don't drag the skit!

896
00:25:53,830 --> 00:25:54,630
Let's just go!

897
00:25:57,010 --> 00:26:00,130
Hello!

898
00:25:57,080 --> 00:26:01,400
Nobu's gonna be faster to react!

899
00:25:57,080 --> 00:26:01,400
Routine: Vol 2

900
00:26:00,130 --> 00:26:01,070
Thank you!

901
00:26:01,070 --> 00:26:03,680
Right, got a scary story for you.

902
00:26:02,610 --> 00:26:04,180
A scary story, sure.

903
00:26:03,680 --> 00:26:05,800
I had to go to Kyushu for a job.

904
00:26:05,050 --> 00:26:05,800
Gotcha, Kyushu!

905
00:26:05,800 --> 00:26:08,400
Suddenly I had to stay overnight at a rundown hotel!

906
00:26:07,660 --> 00:26:09,200
Oh man that's scary!

907
00:26:08,400 --> 00:26:10,560
Yeah scary ok, so the door opened like this:

908
00:26:10,560 --> 00:26:12,020
Are you in a spaceship?!

909
00:26:12,020 --> 00:26:13,550
Are you a spaceship crew member?!

910
00:26:13,550 --> 00:26:15,920
The alien's stuck to you!

911
00:26:15,920 --> 00:26:18,580
And so Dracula-

912
00:26:16,450 --> 00:26:17,760
DRACULA

913
00:26:17,760 --> 00:26:18,580
HE CAME!

914
00:26:18,580 --> 00:26:19,940
Creeeeeeaaaaak

915
00:26:18,920 --> 00:26:19,940
No need for that!

916
00:26:19,940 --> 00:26:23,300
So I was in an empty room but still felt a presence

917
00:26:22,830 --> 00:26:23,810
Yeah know that feeling

918
00:26:23,300 --> 00:26:24,740
So I was really tired and went to bed

919
00:26:24,740 --> 00:26:27,900
Walking towards the bed, there was someone on the bed, so I shoved him aside---

920
00:26:25,710 --> 00:26:27,900
Oh damn! Another one!

921
00:26:27,900 --> 00:26:29,020
A second mysterious person!!

922
00:26:29,020 --> 00:26:32,420
So I went to bed sorta like this, right?

923
00:26:30,520 --> 00:26:31,810
It was way late at night!?

924
00:26:31,810 --> 00:26:32,420
AT NIGHT!

925
00:26:32,420 --> 00:26:34,010
I woke up and couldn't move!

926
00:26:33,410 --> 00:26:34,010
Frozen stiff!

927
00:26:34,010 --> 00:26:34,530
I could only look around - stare

928
00:26:34,530 --> 00:26:34,770
I could only look around - starestare

929
00:26:34,770 --> 00:26:34,890
I could only look around - stare, stare, stare,

930
00:26:34,890 --> 00:26:34,980
I could only look around - stare, stare, stare,
stare,

931
00:26:34,890 --> 00:26:35,910
We get the idea!

932
00:26:34,980 --> 00:26:35,140
I could only look around - stare, stare, stare,
stare, stare,

933
00:26:35,140 --> 00:26:35,300
I could only look around - stare, stare, stare
stare, stare, stare,

934
00:26:35,300 --> 00:26:35,670
I could only look around - stare, stare, stare,
stare, stare, stare, stare,

935
00:26:35,670 --> 00:26:35,840
I could only look around - stare, stare, stare,
stare, stare, stare, stare, stare,

936
00:26:35,840 --> 00:26:35,990
I could only look around - stare, stare, stare, stare, stare, stare, stare, stare, stare,

937
00:26:35,990 --> 00:26:37,620
I could only look around - stare, stare, stare,
stare, stare, stare, stare, stare, stare, stare.

938
00:26:36,870 --> 00:26:37,620
Just say it twice!

939
00:26:37,620 --> 00:26:39,950
So when I was paralyzed, you remember what happened?

940
00:26:39,950 --> 00:26:42,660
A ghost showed up with the hat and all!

941
00:26:41,810 --> 00:26:42,660
That was just the guy on the bed

942
00:26:42,660 --> 00:26:43,540
That was the ghost!

943
00:26:43,540 --> 00:26:48,030
So I saw the pitch black monster and if I looked closely I saw more black-

944
00:26:46,590 --> 00:26:48,030
IT'S BLACK BLACK, BLACK!

945
00:26:48,030 --> 00:26:52,770
So it came at me and right before disappearing it said:

946
00:26:52,770 --> 00:26:53,050
Sh-

947
00:26:53,050 --> 00:26:53,840
I DON'T UNDERSTAND!

948
00:26:55,040 --> 00:26:56,010
I didn't UNDERSTAND!

949
00:26:56,010 --> 00:26:57,300
So an hour and some minutes later

950
00:26:57,300 --> 00:26:58,280
Just say an hour!

951
00:26:58,280 --> 00:27:00,120
Once again I was paralyzed! Saw the ghost!

952
00:26:59,290 --> 00:27:00,120
Oh man!

953
00:27:00,120 --> 00:27:02,800
Sickle in his right, rice in his left!

954
00:27:01,730 --> 00:27:02,800
FARMER!

955
00:27:04,090 --> 00:27:05,180
So again

956
00:27:05,180 --> 00:27:07,840
It came at me, and just before disappearing:

957
00:27:07,840 --> 00:27:09,540
You should have beat him up!

958
00:27:08,760 --> 00:27:09,540
@#$%!^*)!&!

959
00:27:10,220 --> 00:27:13,550
Thanks much!

960
00:27:12,070 --> 00:27:13,550
What the hell?!

961
00:27:14,550 --> 00:27:17,720
Fast! But still shit!

962
00:27:15,060 --> 00:27:16,160
Can we stop here?

963
00:27:16,120 --> 00:27:17,720
Fast! But still shit!

964
00:27:17,720 --> 00:27:18,900
That was really fast

965
00:27:17,720 --> 00:27:20,730
Why would you perform like shit at a crucial moment?!

966
00:27:19,980 --> 00:27:20,820
Too fast to follow.

967
00:27:20,730 --> 00:27:23,400
Why are you retorting

968
00:27:20,820 --> 00:27:21,340
Yeah.

969
00:27:21,860 --> 00:27:23,400
before I even finish the joke?!

970
00:27:23,400 --> 00:27:27,560
During the Tommy's manzai

971
00:27:23,400 --> 00:27:27,560
T/N: Tommy's is an old manzai duo consisting of the two members, Ken and Masa.

972
00:27:24,160 --> 00:27:27,670
During the Tommy's manzai

973
00:27:25,230 --> 00:27:27,670
after Ken-san forgot one of his retorts

974
00:27:27,670 --> 00:27:32,200
Ken-san began to

975
00:27:29,300 --> 00:27:32,200
retort one joke ahead of Masa-san

976
00:27:33,060 --> 00:27:34,650
That was pretty stupid

977
00:27:33,110 --> 00:27:35,380
It's becoming like that!

978
00:27:35,380 --> 00:27:37,210
He's being really strict.

979
00:27:36,090 --> 00:27:37,210
He's really going at him

980
00:27:37,210 --> 00:27:42,850
Masa-san realized that

981
00:27:39,380 --> 00:27:42,850
so after that he restored it back to the previous joke

982
00:27:40,850 --> 00:27:42,850
so after that he restored it back to the previous joke

983
00:27:42,850 --> 00:27:44,650
Ken-san, at that point, reverted to another previous one

984
00:27:44,650 --> 00:27:48,460
And then ended up with a manzai in reverse

985
00:27:48,460 --> 00:27:51,990
It's becoming like that!!

986
00:27:50,630 --> 00:27:51,770
That's just bad-mouthing

987
00:27:51,770 --> 00:27:52,580
Seriously?

988
00:27:52,580 --> 00:27:53,830
Oh, one more thing.

989
00:27:53,830 --> 00:27:56,400
The bit with "I don't understand you"

990
00:27:55,410 --> 00:27:56,400
Yeah, the peak of the joke

991
00:27:56,400 --> 00:27:58,330
Could you repeat the line I said

992
00:27:58,330 --> 00:28:00,870
Could you repeat the line I said

993
00:27:59,230 --> 00:28:00,870
right after me?

994
00:28:00,870 --> 00:28:04,640
When you go "That's the most important part"

995
00:28:04,640 --> 00:28:05,570
Be sure to get it right.

996
00:28:05,570 --> 00:28:09,950
So after you say @#$%!^*

997
00:28:09,880 --> 00:28:10,810
Don't you DARE mock my ghost lines!

998
00:28:10,810 --> 00:28:13,050
Don't you DARE mock my ghost lines!

999
00:28:12,930 --> 00:28:15,300
I thought of those lines really carefully!

1000
00:28:15,300 --> 00:28:16,460
Don't say it so thoughtlessly!

1001
00:28:17,220 --> 00:28:25,980
His spooky lines are glossed over

1002
00:28:17,220 --> 00:28:25,980
The reason they get no laughs:

1003
00:28:17,600 --> 00:28:19,230
So I should let them listen closely?

1004
00:28:18,160 --> 00:28:19,230
Exactly.

1005
00:28:19,230 --> 00:28:21,620
Just say "Let me hear that one more time"

1006
00:28:21,620 --> 00:28:25,980
It's the most important part, so if they don't hear it right, there's no point!

1007
00:28:24,850 --> 00:28:25,980
Let's do it!

1008
00:28:28,450 --> 00:28:31,300
Hellooooo!

1009
00:28:28,560 --> 00:28:36,860
Emphasize the ghostly lines

1010
00:28:28,560 --> 00:28:36,860
Routine: Vol 3

1011
00:28:31,300 --> 00:28:33,090
Thank you, thank you!

1012
00:28:33,090 --> 00:28:36,590
Truth be told, I got a scary story to tell.

1013
00:28:35,330 --> 00:28:37,410
Oh cool, let's hear it.

1014
00:28:36,590 --> 00:28:38,670
I was at a gig in Kyushu a while back

1015
00:28:37,730 --> 00:28:38,670
Right, right.

1016
00:28:38,670 --> 00:28:40,160
And I had to stay the night.

1017
00:28:40,160 --> 00:28:42,500
So I got a room at this worn-down hotel

1018
00:28:41,810 --> 00:28:43,010
Oh that's creepy.

1019
00:28:42,500 --> 00:28:44,080
But, no other options, I had to stay.

1020
00:28:44,080 --> 00:28:45,680
The doors opened like this

1021
00:28:45,680 --> 00:28:46,980
Wait, now you're in a spaceship?

1022
00:28:47,930 --> 00:28:49,210
Are you a spaceship crew member?

1023
00:28:49,650 --> 00:28:51,130
The aliens are stuck on you??

1024
00:28:51,130 --> 00:28:53,460
Then I went and got my key from Dracula.

1025
00:28:53,460 --> 00:28:55,160
Now we got Dracula!

1026
00:28:55,160 --> 00:28:57,750
We got ourselves a scary one!

1027
00:28:57,750 --> 00:28:58,760
Creeeeaaaak

1028
00:28:58,760 --> 00:29:00,500
No need for that, keep going.

1029
00:29:00,500 --> 00:29:03,030
I'm sure you've all felt this, but as I entered my room

1030
00:29:03,030 --> 00:29:04,700
Though the place should've been empty

1031
00:29:04,700 --> 00:29:06,610
I felt some kind of presence.

1032
00:29:05,790 --> 00:29:07,060
Not a good feeling...

1033
00:29:06,610 --> 00:29:09,810
True that, but I was tired so I went straight to bed

1034
00:29:09,810 --> 00:29:12,430
There was someone on the bed, so I pushed them aside

1035
00:29:10,990 --> 00:29:12,430
Another weirdo!

1036
00:29:12,430 --> 00:29:13,580
The second one!

1037
00:29:13,580 --> 00:29:16,000
So, in the dead of night

1038
00:29:15,440 --> 00:29:16,530
Yeah?

1039
00:29:16,000 --> 00:29:16,530
BANG

1040
00:29:16,530 --> 00:29:16,970
Hm? What?

1041
00:29:16,970 --> 00:29:17,480
Paralyzed.

1042
00:29:17,480 --> 00:29:17,970
Paralyzed?

1043
00:29:17,970 --> 00:29:19,390
My body wouldn't move!

1044
00:29:19,390 --> 00:29:20,430
But I could still look around like stare,

1045
00:29:20,430 --> 00:29:20,660
But I could still look around like stare, stare,

1046
00:29:20,660 --> 00:29:21,050
But I could still look around like stare, stare, stare.

1047
00:29:21,050 --> 00:29:21,320
But I could still look around like stare, stare, stare.
Stare,

1048
00:29:21,320 --> 00:29:21,570
But I could still look around like stare, stare, stare.
Stare, stare,

1049
00:29:21,570 --> 00:29:21,840
But I could still look around like stare, stare, stare.
Stare, stare, stare,

1050
00:29:21,840 --> 00:29:22,100
But I could still look around like stare, stare, stare.
Stare, stare, stare, stare,

1051
00:29:22,100 --> 00:29:22,350
But I could still look around like stare, stare, stare.
Stare, stare, stare, stare, stare,

1052
00:29:22,350 --> 00:29:22,590
But I could still look around like stare, stare, stare.
Stare, stare, stare, stare, stare, stare,

1053
00:29:22,590 --> 00:29:22,870
But I could still look around like stare, stare, stare.
Stare, stare, stare, stare, stare, stare, stare,

1054
00:29:22,870 --> 00:29:24,460
But I could still look around like stare, stare, stare.
Stare, stare, stare, stare, stare, stare, stare, and stare.

1055
00:29:23,480 --> 00:29:24,460
Yeah we get it!

1056
00:29:24,460 --> 00:29:25,460
Just say it twice!

1057
00:29:25,460 --> 00:29:26,660
I saw, in front of me

1058
00:29:26,660 --> 00:29:27,520
What'd you see?

1059
00:29:27,520 --> 00:29:28,190
A real ghost.

1060
00:29:28,190 --> 00:29:30,480
Like with the white triangle and weird pose?

1061
00:29:30,480 --> 00:29:31,440
No, that's the guy that was on the bed

1062
00:29:31,440 --> 00:29:32,560
So it WAS a ghost?!

1063
00:29:32,560 --> 00:29:36,640
Yeah, but basically it was a completely and utterly black monster

1064
00:29:36,640 --> 00:29:39,220
I don't even know how to explain it

1065
00:29:39,220 --> 00:29:41,700
It was basically as black as can be!

1066
00:29:41,700 --> 00:29:46,020
But, if you looked closely you could also see some black.

1067
00:29:46,020 --> 00:29:51,810
Then it came lunging at me! And just before disappearing it said:

1068
00:29:50,770 --> 00:29:51,810
What?!

1069
00:29:51,810 --> 00:29:53,700
What even was that?!

1070
00:29:53,700 --> 00:29:54,740
I don't get it!

1071
00:29:54,740 --> 00:30:03,890
A motorcycle went past at the most important part

1072
00:29:54,740 --> 00:30:03,890
Why they didn't laugh:

1073
00:29:54,990 --> 00:29:56,970
Whatever, man. Thank you for listening!

1074
00:30:00,400 --> 00:30:01,390
100 points!

1075
00:30:03,920 --> 00:30:04,070
No way!!

1076
00:30:04,070 --> 00:30:06,170
No way!!

1077
00:30:06,550 --> 00:30:08,630
That wasn't planned

1078
00:30:07,200 --> 00:30:10,240
That had to be planned

1079
00:30:08,620 --> 00:30:10,240
What was up with that bike?!

1080
00:30:10,240 --> 00:30:12,270
From now on whenever we do that comedy skit, at my punchline

1081
00:30:12,270 --> 00:30:13,640
From now on whenever we do that comedy skit, at my punchline

1082
00:30:13,640 --> 00:30:14,340
everyone will hear the sound of that bike

1083
00:30:14,340 --> 00:30:16,710
everyone will hear the sound of that bike

1084
00:30:16,710 --> 00:30:18,880
they'd think, so the joke will fail

1085
00:30:16,710 --> 00:30:21,380
"It would've been funnier if the bike vroomed by,"

1086
00:30:18,880 --> 00:30:21,380
they'd think, so the joke will fail

1087
00:30:24,930 --> 00:30:27,230
We can hear them so...

1088
00:30:36,100 --> 00:30:37,600
The timing was superb

1089
00:30:37,600 --> 00:30:40,230
The timing was superb

1090
00:30:38,500 --> 00:30:40,230
It certainly was superb

1091
00:30:41,940 --> 00:30:43,570
Should've just quit that joke!

1092
00:30:43,570 --> 00:30:44,640
Should've just quit that joke!

1093
00:30:44,640 --> 00:30:47,410
You need to consider the damn location!

1094
00:30:46,550 --> 00:30:47,410
What?!

1095
00:30:47,410 --> 00:30:49,740
What the hell do you think you're doing?!!

1096
00:30:51,310 --> 00:30:53,950
Was the narration back there

1097
00:30:52,450 --> 00:30:53,950
done by Taguchi-san?

1098
00:30:54,280 --> 00:30:55,310
It was, wasn't it?

1099
00:30:54,310 --> 00:30:58,990
Actor Taguchi Tomorowo, voice of "Project X"

1100
00:30:54,310 --> 00:30:58,990
The person responsible for the narration at the beginning was

1101
00:30:55,310 --> 00:30:57,570
Ahh, so it was Tomorowo-san

1102
00:30:59,390 --> 00:31:06,490
The tormenting commute is nearly over

1103
00:30:59,390 --> 00:31:06,490
as the police station is in sight

1104
00:30:59,990 --> 00:31:03,010
The long commute is nearly over

1105
00:31:03,940 --> 00:31:06,490
as they approach the police station

1106
00:31:07,490 --> 00:31:08,470
We're here?

1107
00:31:09,130 --> 00:31:11,530
Did we arrive already?

1108
00:31:12,530 --> 00:31:14,640
The group on the bus

1109
00:31:14,640 --> 00:31:17,440
saw the police station come into sight

1110
00:31:17,440 --> 00:31:18,610
However,

1111
00:31:17,440 --> 00:31:20,960
There's still a long way to go!

1112
00:31:18,610 --> 00:31:20,960
it is by no means their goal

1113
00:31:20,500 --> 00:31:22,370
Well, yeah...

1114
00:31:21,140 --> 00:31:24,810
It is their new battlefield

1115
00:31:22,110 --> 00:31:24,790
It is their new battlefield

1116
00:31:25,180 --> 00:31:28,550
We arrived!!~

1117
00:31:26,370 --> 00:31:27,250
Oh no!

1118
00:31:27,250 --> 00:31:28,550
Ohh

1119
00:31:30,260 --> 00:31:32,610
The No-Laughing-Allowed division of the

1120
00:31:32,610 --> 00:31:36,760
Heipo State Omame Central Police Department

1121
00:31:37,090 --> 00:31:47,440
The group's fierce battle against the assassins begins as they

1122
00:31:37,090 --> 00:31:47,440
arrest heinous criminals at the police station of laughter

1123
00:31:37,490 --> 00:31:40,340
The group's fierce battle begins

1124
00:31:40,340 --> 00:31:42,130
as they arrest heinous criminals

1125
00:31:42,140 --> 00:31:47,440
at the police station where laughter is life or death

1126
00:31:47,870 --> 00:31:52,610
ARRIVAL TO THE POLICE STATION

1127
00:31:50,400 --> 00:31:52,110
Shall we get off then?

1128
00:31:52,110 --> 00:31:52,610
All right

1129
00:31:52,610 --> 00:31:54,110
Over here

1130
00:31:53,110 --> 00:31:54,110
Wow

1131
00:31:54,110 --> 00:31:56,840
The statue has changed from last year...

1132
00:31:57,610 --> 00:31:58,780
Everyone, this is Heipo State Omame Central Police Department

1133
00:31:58,780 --> 00:32:03,380
Everyone, this is Heipo State Omame Central Police Department

1134
00:32:03,380 --> 00:32:04,450
And this here

1135
00:32:04,450 --> 00:32:06,050
is the founder

1136
00:32:06,050 --> 00:32:06,920
Heipo Police

1137
00:32:07,240 --> 00:32:10,320
Founder of the police department

1138
00:32:07,240 --> 00:32:10,320
Heipo Police

1139
00:32:07,890 --> 00:32:09,520
Let's show respect

1140
00:32:09,520 --> 00:32:10,320
Attention

1141
00:32:12,430 --> 00:32:13,990
At ease

1142
00:32:14,160 --> 00:32:16,630
Shall we go?

1143
00:32:16,630 --> 00:32:18,910
Is there an explanation?

1144
00:32:19,030 --> 00:32:20,270
Can't you explain what kind of person he is, or something?

1145
00:32:20,270 --> 00:32:22,620
We don't have any history about such a thing!!

1146
00:32:22,620 --> 00:32:24,370
Is that so?

1147
00:32:24,370 --> 00:32:26,810
Such a thing...

1148
00:32:25,750 --> 00:32:26,810
Don't be rude

1149
00:32:27,010 --> 00:32:29,010
This place feels pretty high tech.

1150
00:32:27,020 --> 00:32:30,610
The police station entrance

1151
00:32:29,010 --> 00:32:30,610
Pretty good, eh?

1152
00:32:31,080 --> 00:32:35,010
3rd floor corridor

1153
00:32:32,210 --> 00:32:33,490
Over here

1154
00:32:36,880 --> 00:32:38,720
Omame Central is pretty spacious, isnt it?

1155
00:32:38,720 --> 00:32:40,860
Ah, please wait a moment.

1156
00:32:39,470 --> 00:32:40,860
You're kidding?

1157
00:32:40,860 --> 00:32:44,930
Fujiwara forgot the location of the room

1158
00:32:43,190 --> 00:32:44,930
There's no way it's that way

1159
00:32:46,210 --> 00:32:48,830
Please enter this room

1160
00:32:47,500 --> 00:32:50,430
It's clearly written on here

1161
00:32:50,630 --> 00:32:52,730
Shall we go inside?

1162
00:32:55,520 --> 00:32:56,630
We're here, we're here!

1163
00:32:57,050 --> 00:33:01,780
Fresh recruits' room

1164
00:32:59,860 --> 00:33:01,470
Woah

1165
00:33:01,470 --> 00:33:02,190
Alright everyone,

1166
00:33:02,190 --> 00:33:04,080
You'll see your names on the desk, take a seat there

1167
00:33:04,080 --> 00:33:04,980
and get settled in

1168
00:33:06,580 --> 00:33:07,510
There is clearly something suspicious there

1169
00:33:07,510 --> 00:33:09,150
There is clearly something suspicious there

1170
00:33:09,150 --> 00:33:10,890
Chucky

1171
00:33:10,890 --> 00:33:13,420
Hosei-san was deceived by this in the past

1172
00:33:13,420 --> 00:33:14,370
He has

1173
00:33:14,370 --> 00:33:15,690
Yeah

1174
00:33:17,470 --> 00:33:20,330
This is creepy, plus it's behind me

1175
00:33:20,710 --> 00:33:21,860
Oh my

1176
00:33:22,510 --> 00:33:23,930
Oh man

1177
00:33:26,800 --> 00:33:28,250
Oof

1178
00:33:28,250 --> 00:33:30,200
I want to take a piss...

1179
00:33:30,670 --> 00:33:33,370
What kind of setting is this, Hamada-san?

1180
00:33:34,110 --> 00:33:36,840
Me?

1181
00:33:36,850 --> 00:33:39,050
Well...

1182
00:33:39,050 --> 00:33:41,780
He stands out a lot...

1183
00:33:41,780 --> 00:33:44,350
He kind of looks like an outlaw

1184
00:33:44,350 --> 00:33:46,450
Yeah, but I feel really uncomfortable

1185
00:33:46,450 --> 00:33:51,730
This mustache is uncomfortable,

1186
00:33:48,420 --> 00:33:51,730
The insides of my ears feels gross

1187
00:33:51,730 --> 00:33:52,790
Well that...

1188
00:33:52,790 --> 00:33:55,800
Please don't say things like that

1189
00:33:55,800 --> 00:33:57,150
That won't do

1190
00:34:05,310 --> 00:34:08,480
I'd like to go to the bathroom but...

1191
00:34:07,710 --> 00:34:08,480
Yes, the bathroom...

1192
00:34:08,480 --> 00:34:10,180
I've had to go this whole time!

1193
00:34:10,670 --> 00:34:12,950
Is this how Omame Central does things??

1194
00:34:13,810 --> 00:34:15,320
Hey, Hamada!!

1195
00:34:14,710 --> 00:34:15,320
Yes?

1196
00:34:15,320 --> 00:34:17,650
You really like your outfit that much?

1197
00:34:17,650 --> 00:34:19,750
GO CHANGE

1198
00:34:18,500 --> 00:34:19,750
Right?

1199
00:34:19,750 --> 00:34:22,320
How nice of him!

1200
00:34:19,750 --> 00:34:22,320
How nice!

1201
00:34:24,830 --> 00:34:27,230
What the hell?

1202
00:34:28,640 --> 00:34:29,700
What the hell are you doing?

1203
00:34:29,700 --> 00:34:32,000
Are you stupid?

1204
00:34:32,930 --> 00:34:34,570
He's smiling all satisfied

1205
00:34:34,570 --> 00:34:38,630
I was just feeling thankful, so I'm just gonna...

1206
00:34:41,880 --> 00:34:43,180
You don't have to burn that image onto us

1207
00:34:43,180 --> 00:34:45,410
You don't have to burn that image onto us

1208
00:34:45,810 --> 00:34:47,250
What? Seriously?!

1209
00:34:47,250 --> 00:34:48,980
C'mon

1210
00:34:49,190 --> 00:34:51,350
He's trying to burn that image in...

1211
00:34:50,180 --> 00:34:51,350
No way...

1212
00:34:51,350 --> 00:34:53,920
He leaves scars and then just walks off

1213
00:34:52,990 --> 00:34:53,920
Tanaka

1214
00:34:53,920 --> 00:34:55,640
is seriously the one...

1215
00:34:55,640 --> 00:34:56,790
who laughs a lot, but...

1216
00:34:56,790 --> 00:34:57,970
He was being vague

1217
00:35:00,880 --> 00:35:03,030
An hour and 30 minutes have passed since the start

1218
00:35:01,790 --> 00:35:06,570
An hour and 30 minutes since the start

1219
00:35:01,790 --> 00:35:06,570
Released from the destructive power of Hamada's face

1220
00:35:03,030 --> 00:35:06,570
The group is released from the destructive power of Hamada's face

1221
00:35:06,880 --> 00:35:13,810
After that, the 5 members

1222
00:35:06,880 --> 00:35:13,810
await the dreadful drawer traps!

1223
00:35:06,900 --> 00:35:08,930
However, after that

1224
00:35:08,930 --> 00:35:13,810
for them await the dreadful drawer traps!

1225
00:35:15,610 --> 00:35:20,310
An hour and 30 minutes of working at the police department

1226
00:35:16,230 --> 00:35:18,480
9:30 am

1227
00:35:18,480 --> 00:35:21,060
Before they start opening their drawers

1228
00:35:21,190 --> 00:35:23,520
the group waits for Hamada to change outfits

1229
00:35:23,870 --> 00:35:25,550
It's

1230
00:35:25,550 --> 00:35:26,220
good that that guy, Hamada isn't here

1231
00:35:26,220 --> 00:35:29,060
good that that guy, Hamada isn't here

1232
00:35:27,700 --> 00:35:29,060
That's right

1233
00:35:27,810 --> 00:35:29,460
Because we're the ones who end up getting hit

1234
00:35:28,460 --> 00:35:29,810
You're right

1235
00:35:30,070 --> 00:35:31,530
It's a win for us all.

1236
00:35:30,820 --> 00:35:31,530
Right!

1237
00:35:31,530 --> 00:35:33,330
It's like a small break

1238
00:35:31,530 --> 00:35:33,330
It's just continuous

1239
00:35:33,330 --> 00:35:37,310
It's not like we can get by without talking at all

1240
00:35:36,450 --> 00:35:37,310
That's right

1241
00:35:41,970 --> 00:35:46,670
Changed to the bobbed hair wig

1242
00:35:45,790 --> 00:35:46,670
Why though?

1243
00:35:46,670 --> 00:35:49,840
Was there nothing normal to choose from?

1244
00:35:50,540 --> 00:35:51,210
Was there nothing normal to choose from?

1245
00:35:51,210 --> 00:35:53,910
Was there nothing normal to choose from?

1246
00:35:55,650 --> 00:35:57,250
That's not how your head usually looks

1247
00:35:57,870 --> 00:35:58,850
Just wear the usual

1248
00:35:58,850 --> 00:36:01,860
Keep your usual clothes on

1249
00:36:01,860 --> 00:36:04,220
Wouldn't that be fine?

1250
00:36:02,470 --> 00:36:04,220
Right!

1251
00:36:04,220 --> 00:36:06,530
Is that normal for you?

1252
00:36:07,160 --> 00:36:10,460
Well, if you ask me like that...

1253
00:36:11,870 --> 00:36:14,100
Can't you just refuse?

1254
00:36:14,100 --> 00:36:16,240
Even if I do refuse

1255
00:36:14,640 --> 00:36:17,200
Just take it off

1256
00:36:16,240 --> 00:36:17,200
With this

1257
00:36:17,200 --> 00:36:19,540
Everyone says it's "the usual"

1258
00:36:19,540 --> 00:36:22,180
No one says that's enough

1259
00:36:22,180 --> 00:36:25,580
I've been telling you this the whole time

1260
00:36:24,260 --> 00:36:25,710
What is this??

1261
00:36:25,710 --> 00:36:26,710
Really, what's with that face?

1262
00:36:28,010 --> 00:36:30,110
It's Tanaka's fault, it's because...

1263
00:36:32,810 --> 00:36:34,310
Tanaka, you're getting complacent

1264
00:36:35,190 --> 00:36:37,090
That's something

1265
00:36:37,090 --> 00:36:39,160
You're barking

1266
00:36:38,190 --> 00:36:39,160
That's not the case, though

1267
00:36:43,900 --> 00:36:45,930
Gorgeous!!

1268
00:36:47,510 --> 00:36:48,700
Well, let's keep going

1269
00:36:49,370 --> 00:36:52,140
I thought the outfit changing had already stopped

1270
00:36:52,140 --> 00:36:53,470
Is that so?

1271
00:36:53,470 --> 00:36:56,110
I was kind of expecting it

1272
00:36:54,670 --> 00:36:56,110
You were?

1273
00:36:56,340 --> 00:36:57,940
That's fine but, like

1274
00:36:57,940 --> 00:36:58,810
why are you sporting a cold perm hairstyle?

1275
00:36:57,940 --> 00:37:03,420
T/N: A cold perm is for creating curly/wavy hair.

1276
00:36:58,810 --> 00:37:03,420
why are you sporting a cold perm hairstyle?

1277
00:37:07,220 --> 00:37:09,940
Just recently you started getting cold perms

1278
00:37:08,870 --> 00:37:09,940
Yes, really

1279
00:37:09,940 --> 00:37:11,890
Since coming here

1280
00:37:10,770 --> 00:37:11,890
What the hell is this?

1281
00:37:13,270 --> 00:37:14,390
Oh, that's true

1282
00:37:14,390 --> 00:37:16,130
Since he's come here, it's been like that

1283
00:37:16,130 --> 00:37:19,940
Even though it was straight

1284
00:37:16,910 --> 00:37:18,610
Yeah thats right

1285
00:37:18,610 --> 00:37:19,940
Did you not notice?

1286
00:37:19,940 --> 00:37:21,800
It's a pretty strong perm

1287
00:37:20,690 --> 00:37:23,570
Yes, it's more styled

1288
00:37:21,800 --> 00:37:23,570
What is up with that?

1289
00:37:23,870 --> 00:37:25,810
Well, because it's fashionable

1290
00:37:25,810 --> 00:37:26,170
But

1291
00:37:26,170 --> 00:37:28,140
A wavy hairstyle might be better

1292
00:37:28,140 --> 00:37:29,280
To cover up this area

1293
00:37:29,280 --> 00:37:31,600
Is that so?

1294
00:37:29,280 --> 00:37:34,950
HOSEI'S HAIR HAS LATELY BECOME THINNER

1295
00:37:31,600 --> 00:37:33,310
If it were straight, it'd be more notic---

1296
00:37:33,310 --> 00:37:34,950
It would just part right down the middle

1297
00:37:35,360 --> 00:37:37,350
Tanaka, how is it?

1298
00:37:36,180 --> 00:37:37,350
It's incredible

1299
00:37:38,400 --> 00:37:39,630
Yep.

1300
00:37:41,390 --> 00:37:44,960
Let's stop it already

1301
00:37:45,110 --> 00:37:46,810
"Let's stop it already"...

1302
00:37:49,310 --> 00:37:51,780
Let's just stop it

1303
00:37:51,780 --> 00:37:53,150
Seriously, though

1304
00:37:55,230 --> 00:37:56,210
Yeah, let's

1305
00:37:56,210 --> 00:37:58,430
Yeah, in a place like this

1306
00:37:57,230 --> 00:37:58,430
Yes, it's kind of...

1307
00:37:58,430 --> 00:38:00,010
That's no good

1308
00:38:00,010 --> 00:38:01,550
What kind of smell does it have?

1309
00:38:01,710 --> 00:38:02,660
See?

1310
00:38:02,660 --> 00:38:03,880
He says something different again

1311
00:38:02,810 --> 00:38:05,650
The bald spot

1312
00:38:05,650 --> 00:38:09,020
I've never really smelled it

1313
00:38:09,020 --> 00:38:12,550
How about we carry you and smell it?

1314
00:38:10,820 --> 00:38:12,550
We'll pick you up,

1315
00:38:12,550 --> 00:38:13,620
you, Yamasaki

1316
00:38:13,890 --> 00:38:15,990
Carry?

1317
00:38:16,890 --> 00:38:19,060
Like a coffin

1318
00:38:19,060 --> 00:38:20,560
Shall we carry him?

1319
00:38:20,560 --> 00:38:22,500
Hmm?

1320
00:38:20,610 --> 00:38:22,990
I didn't think we'd actually do it

1321
00:38:22,990 --> 00:38:25,090
Why carry him like a coffin?

1322
00:38:23,300 --> 00:38:25,030
How should we do this?

1323
00:38:29,940 --> 00:38:31,540
Go and smell it

1324
00:38:31,540 --> 00:38:33,490
Hold me properly

1325
00:38:33,710 --> 00:38:33,840
Pffftt

1326
00:38:33,840 --> 00:38:34,740
Pffftt

1327
00:38:34,350 --> 00:38:34,740
Eh?

1328
00:38:34,740 --> 00:38:36,640
Hold on a minute

1329
00:38:36,640 --> 00:38:37,920
It stinks!

1330
00:38:38,450 --> 00:38:38,580
It stinks!!

1331
00:38:38,580 --> 00:38:39,110
It stinks!!

1332
00:38:39,110 --> 00:38:39,910
It stinks!!

1333
00:38:40,180 --> 00:38:40,330
It stinks!!

1334
00:38:40,330 --> 00:38:43,150
It stinks!!

1335
00:38:41,280 --> 00:38:41,430
It stinks!!

1336
00:38:41,430 --> 00:38:43,150
It stinks!!

1337
00:38:42,150 --> 00:38:42,280
It stinks!!

1338
00:38:42,280 --> 00:38:43,150
It stinks!!

1339
00:38:44,870 --> 00:38:46,480
What's with that smell?

1340
00:38:45,920 --> 00:38:48,210
How did we get here

1341
00:38:46,480 --> 00:38:49,750
Let's stop it already

1342
00:38:49,740 --> 00:38:51,760
What's wrong with this guy?

1343
00:38:52,580 --> 00:38:54,400
Ahh, scary

1344
00:38:54,770 --> 00:38:56,830
It was Yamasaki who did it, right?

1345
00:38:55,860 --> 00:38:56,830
Yes yes yes

1346
00:38:56,830 --> 00:38:59,100
Because he was being carried

1347
00:38:58,030 --> 00:39:00,300
What are you doing?

1348
00:38:58,660 --> 00:38:59,670
It stinks!!

1349
00:38:59,670 --> 00:39:00,300
It stinks!!

1350
00:39:00,290 --> 00:39:02,370
It seriously stank

1351
00:39:03,440 --> 00:39:06,040
Because Hamada lifted me up like that

1352
00:39:06,040 --> 00:39:08,880
the poof came out

1353
00:39:07,780 --> 00:39:11,210
But still, doesn't it stink?

1354
00:39:11,210 --> 00:39:13,210
It can't be helped that it stinks

1355
00:39:13,210 --> 00:39:17,380
I only wanted to smell your head...

1356
00:39:22,550 --> 00:39:24,790
Seriously, what is this even?

1357
00:39:29,860 --> 00:39:32,030
It's enough already

1358
00:39:30,560 --> 00:39:32,030
Let's stop

1359
00:39:32,030 --> 00:39:33,970
We're old now

1360
00:39:32,500 --> 00:39:33,970
It's fine already

1361
00:39:34,200 --> 00:39:37,700
We'll smell it later

1362
00:39:36,240 --> 00:39:37,700
Where there won't be any cameras

1363
00:39:37,700 --> 00:39:40,370
I don't want to anymore

1364
00:39:39,540 --> 00:39:41,180
Why the hell

1365
00:39:41,510 --> 00:39:43,140
Now then

1366
00:39:43,140 --> 00:39:44,010
Everyone, I think we're all aware of this but

1367
00:39:44,010 --> 00:39:48,180
Everyone, I think we're all aware of this but

1368
00:39:48,650 --> 00:39:53,150
We've all got drawers...

1369
00:39:50,240 --> 00:39:51,910
Yep, every year.

1370
00:39:51,910 --> 00:39:53,150
Yeah

1371
00:39:53,620 --> 00:39:54,960
There's also a DVD player

1372
00:39:54,960 --> 00:39:57,960
DVD player

1373
00:39:56,800 --> 00:39:57,960
Let Tanaka open it

1374
00:39:57,960 --> 00:39:59,600
I'm not so sure about that

1375
00:39:57,960 --> 00:40:06,030
8 years of consecutive DVD thai kicking

1376
00:39:57,960 --> 00:40:06,030
Airport

1377
00:39:57,960 --> 00:40:06,030
Detective

1378
00:39:57,960 --> 00:40:06,030
EDF

1379
00:39:57,960 --> 00:40:06,030
Hotel

1380
00:39:57,960 --> 00:40:06,030
Prison

1381
00:39:57,960 --> 00:40:06,030
Scientist

1382
00:39:57,960 --> 00:40:06,030
Spy

1383
00:39:57,960 --> 00:40:06,030
Teacher

1384
00:40:01,830 --> 00:40:04,590
Earlier, Tanaka or myself have been

1385
00:40:04,590 --> 00:40:07,500
the first to open up our drawers

1386
00:40:06,560 --> 00:40:07,500
That's right

1387
00:40:07,510 --> 00:40:10,120
And then we just went around the table

1388
00:40:10,130 --> 00:40:11,870
Well, mind if I take the lead this year?

1389
00:40:11,890 --> 00:40:16,870
Matsumoto will be this year's first opener

1390
00:40:12,510 --> 00:40:13,300
I see

1391
00:40:13,620 --> 00:40:14,720
We don't know after all

1392
00:40:14,720 --> 00:40:15,300
Makes sense

1393
00:40:16,920 --> 00:40:20,580
It's always frightening

1394
00:40:18,900 --> 00:40:20,390
Yeah cause we have no idea what's inside

1395
00:40:21,910 --> 00:40:23,680
Okay come on, I'll try

1396
00:40:23,680 --> 00:40:25,890
I wonder if it will open properly this time

1397
00:40:25,890 --> 00:40:29,060
Last time it was so old it was hard to open

1398
00:40:30,770 --> 00:40:32,630
Nothing inside

1399
00:40:31,630 --> 00:40:32,510
Nothing in there

1400
00:40:38,130 --> 00:40:39,330
Oooh! There it is!

1401
00:40:39,940 --> 00:40:41,860
A DVD!

1402
00:40:41,040 --> 00:40:41,990
A DVD

1403
00:40:42,050 --> 00:40:43,630
I don't like this

1404
00:40:43,630 --> 00:40:45,630
A DVD, huh...

1405
00:40:46,160 --> 00:40:49,330
Mysterious DVD

1406
00:40:46,370 --> 00:40:47,170
A single DVD

1407
00:40:47,650 --> 00:40:49,620
Well it's pretty common in this part

1408
00:40:49,830 --> 00:40:53,540
This one's strange, there's usually a "1" or "2" written on the DVDs we get each year

1409
00:40:53,540 --> 00:40:56,370
but there's only "DVD" written on this one

1410
00:40:56,370 --> 00:40:57,170
I see

1411
00:40:59,810 --> 00:41:02,080
This gives me a bad feeling

1412
00:41:02,750 --> 00:41:05,650
We can't just avoid it and move on, right?

1413
00:41:05,650 --> 00:41:07,230
Well we'll have to watch it anyway eventually

1414
00:41:09,360 --> 00:41:10,270
Well, I think

1415
00:41:11,150 --> 00:41:12,970
It won't hurt that much just to watch this DVD, right?

1416
00:41:12,970 --> 00:41:17,250
It won't hurt that much just to watch this DVD, right?

1417
00:41:17,830 --> 00:41:20,100
Appearance OK Derby

1418
00:41:22,130 --> 00:41:24,580
Will our famous guests say yes to performing

1419
00:41:24,580 --> 00:41:27,310
while wearing an unexpected disguise?

1420
00:41:28,980 --> 00:41:32,640
These are the various discussions they had, filmed by our hidden cameras

1421
00:41:30,190 --> 00:41:33,120
Negotiations were filmed by a hidden camera

1422
00:41:34,030 --> 00:41:35,440
And the disguise they'll wear for us is...

1423
00:41:36,050 --> 00:41:39,190
Banana juice is completed! Foooooh!!

1424
00:41:40,110 --> 00:41:41,860
Razor Ramon HG

1425
00:41:43,940 --> 00:41:47,090
Three celebrities are the candidates!

1426
00:41:44,210 --> 00:41:47,090
Three celebrities will participate in this race!

1427
00:41:48,050 --> 00:41:51,730
Who among them will be the one to say yes to performing!?

1428
00:41:51,730 --> 00:41:52,660
What is it all about?

1429
00:41:52,740 --> 00:41:54,230
First one is this person

1430
00:41:54,390 --> 00:41:55,600
Good morning

1431
00:41:55,600 --> 00:41:58,400
It's a pleasure to work with you

1432
00:41:57,060 --> 00:41:57,650
The pleasure is mine

1433
00:41:57,910 --> 00:41:59,680
Please have a seat

1434
00:42:01,950 --> 00:42:02,770
Eeeh!?

1435
00:42:03,760 --> 00:42:04,450
Thank you

1436
00:42:04,450 --> 00:42:05,410
Ehh!?

1437
00:42:06,230 --> 00:42:07,730
Is he really doing this for us?

1438
00:42:08,390 --> 00:42:11,280
Kobayashi Nenji

1439
00:42:08,390 --> 00:42:11,280
MMMMMMMMMMMMMMMM

1440
00:42:12,880 --> 00:42:14,880
A resolute actor with 55 years of activity

1441
00:42:12,880 --> 00:42:20,750
For his acting in the 1999 movie "Poppoya"

1442
00:42:12,880 --> 00:42:20,770
He received the Japanese Academy Prize as best male actor

1443
00:42:12,880 --> 00:42:27,030
T/N: This footage in the background is from the movie released in 1999, "Poppoya" which means "Railroad Man". Directed by Yasuo Furuhata. Screenplay written by Yoshiki Iwama.

1444
00:42:14,880 --> 00:42:17,490
He was presented with the Japan Academy Prize as best male actor

1445
00:42:17,490 --> 00:42:19,910
by appearing in the movie "Poppoya"

1446
00:42:21,750 --> 00:42:24,160
Here's the discussion we had with the star

1447
00:42:21,750 --> 00:42:27,030
55 years as a devoted actor

1448
00:42:21,750 --> 00:42:27,030
Our discussion with our famous guest acknowledged by Takakura Ken

1449
00:42:24,160 --> 00:42:26,320
acknowledged by Takakura Ken himself about taking part on our show!

1450
00:42:27,470 --> 00:42:29,790
We're from the show "Gaki no Tsukai"

1451
00:42:30,150 --> 00:42:31,490
Have you ever seen it?

1452
00:42:31,550 --> 00:42:33,060
I have

1453
00:42:32,240 --> 00:42:33,460
Ah, we're glad to hear that

1454
00:42:33,070 --> 00:42:33,780
Of course I have

1455
00:42:34,190 --> 00:42:35,220
The one in which you dealt with kids, was it?

1456
00:42:35,220 --> 00:42:37,680
The one in which you dealt with kids, was it?

1457
00:42:37,680 --> 00:42:39,730
In which you made them go do the errands or such...?

1458
00:42:39,970 --> 00:42:43,250
That's a show called "Hajimete no Otsukai" (my first errand) and it's not "Gaki no Tsukai"

1459
00:42:39,970 --> 00:42:44,640
T/N: "Hajimete no Otsukai" is a variety show where kids (usually preschool or kindergarten age) are sent off to run errands alone. They are supervised with wireless microphones and hidden cameras to document how well they can accomplish the task given.

1460
00:42:42,640 --> 00:42:44,670
He mixed 'em up because of the word "Tsukai"

1461
00:42:43,250 --> 00:42:44,800
That's a show called "Hajimete no Otsukai" (my first errand) and it's not "Gaki no Tsukai"

1462
00:42:44,790 --> 00:42:46,030
I see, it's not "Gaki no Tsukai"

1463
00:42:46,020 --> 00:42:47,170
Ahh, "Otsukai" and "Tsukai"

1464
00:42:46,030 --> 00:42:47,870
I'm sorry

1465
00:42:47,150 --> 00:42:48,670
Yeah, it's that word

1466
00:42:47,870 --> 00:42:49,860
Do you happen to know Downtown?

1467
00:42:49,890 --> 00:42:50,640
Yes, of course

1468
00:42:50,800 --> 00:42:52,310
Matsumoto-san doesn't know me personally

1469
00:42:52,310 --> 00:42:55,200
Matsumoto-san doesn't know me personally

1470
00:42:54,910 --> 00:42:55,550
I see

1471
00:42:55,710 --> 00:42:56,530
What about Hamada-san?

1472
00:42:56,530 --> 00:42:58,150
Yes, a long time ago

1473
00:42:58,710 --> 00:43:05,070
He appeared in the 1991 drama "Papa to Nacchan" with Hamada

1474
00:42:58,710 --> 00:43:05,070
T/N: "Papa to Nacchan" (meaning "Papa and Nacchan") is a 1991 drama that is sequel to "Papa wa Newscaster" and "Papa wa Nenjuu Kurou Suru".

1475
00:42:58,720 --> 00:42:59,550
We took part in "Papa to Nacchan"

1476
00:42:59,630 --> 00:43:01,280
Oh, that's right

1477
00:42:59,650 --> 00:43:00,270
Yeah, true

1478
00:43:01,140 --> 00:43:02,420
Oh right

1479
00:43:01,790 --> 00:43:04,150
What was your impression of Hamada?

1480
00:43:04,430 --> 00:43:05,060
Hmm, well

1481
00:43:05,460 --> 00:43:07,670
He felt like a neighborhood bully, and it felt good to look at him

1482
00:43:07,670 --> 00:43:10,500
He felt like a neighborhood bully, and it felt good to look at him

1483
00:43:09,330 --> 00:43:10,260
Is that so?

1484
00:43:10,600 --> 00:43:11,190
He seems like those "kenkattare", as they call them in Kansai

1485
00:43:10,610 --> 00:43:13,500
T/N: "Kenkattare" is composed of the words kenka = fight, and -ttare = sort of like "person who would easily do X"

1486
00:43:11,190 --> 00:43:13,500
He seems like those "kenkattare", as they call them in Kansai

1487
00:43:12,830 --> 00:43:13,670
Yes

1488
00:43:13,670 --> 00:43:15,830
And what can you say about the duo called Cocorico?

1489
00:43:15,860 --> 00:43:18,260
I know their name, sure

1490
00:43:17,470 --> 00:43:18,290
Oh, really?

1491
00:43:18,310 --> 00:43:20,290
And what about Tsukitei Hosei?

1492
00:43:24,110 --> 00:43:25,150
Well...

1493
00:43:25,150 --> 00:43:27,510
Sorry

1494
00:43:27,620 --> 00:43:29,220
I haven't studied enough

1495
00:43:35,350 --> 00:43:37,590
He really hasn't studied enough, huh... Geez

1496
00:43:37,620 --> 00:43:39,330
Well it hasn't been long since you've
changed your name, that's why

1497
00:43:38,850 --> 00:43:39,730
Yeah that's it

1498
00:43:39,330 --> 00:43:42,180
Well it hasn't been long since you've
changed your name, that's why

1499
00:43:42,180 --> 00:43:43,830
He doesn't know who Hosei-san is...

1500
00:43:42,730 --> 00:43:44,560
I mean if he knew about us he would surely know him too

1501
00:43:44,370 --> 00:43:45,510
Yeah I-

1502
00:43:44,560 --> 00:43:46,350
I mean if he knew about us he would surely know him too

1503
00:43:46,050 --> 00:43:46,830
That's what I thought

1504
00:43:46,350 --> 00:43:47,630
I mean if he knew about us he would surely know him too

1505
00:43:48,090 --> 00:43:49,970
And so, our real question

1506
00:43:50,610 --> 00:43:53,860
We were wondering if you would give your consent to perform a comedy skit for us

1507
00:43:53,990 --> 00:43:56,050
A significant responsibility, isn't it?

1508
00:43:56,050 --> 00:43:59,700
An HG clip was shown to him so he would know what it's all about

1509
00:44:00,320 --> 00:44:02,800
Hard Gay has come~

1510
00:44:05,040 --> 00:44:06,900
More! More!

1511
00:44:06,900 --> 00:44:09,410
Mo~re! Oka~y!

1512
00:44:10,420 --> 00:44:11,890
So, what do you think of what you just saw?

1513
00:44:12,230 --> 00:44:15,620
I want to attempt it

1514
00:44:14,070 --> 00:44:15,090
That's what I thought

1515
00:44:15,350 --> 00:44:15,650
Huh?

1516
00:44:15,650 --> 00:44:17,920
His main feature is his high-pitched voice

1517
00:44:15,990 --> 00:44:16,230
What?

1518
00:44:16,230 --> 00:44:16,630
For real?

1519
00:44:18,110 --> 00:44:20,850
But I don't think you have such an high pitch...

1520
00:44:20,740 --> 00:44:21,550
That's not true at all

1521
00:44:21,600 --> 00:44:21,830
Ah

1522
00:44:21,830 --> 00:44:22,670
Foo~!

1523
00:44:23,190 --> 00:44:24,160
Foo~!

1524
00:44:25,620 --> 00:44:27,760
We'll have you wear his outfit for us and I'm sure if you came out like this in front of the five of them,
it'll make them laugh their head off, no doubt

1525
00:44:27,760 --> 00:44:29,360
We'll have you wear his outfit for us and I'm sure if you came out like this in front of the five of them,
it'll make them laugh their head off, no doubt

1526
00:44:29,360 --> 00:44:30,980
We'll have you wear his outfit for us and I'm sure if you came out like this in front of the five of them,
it'll make them laugh their head off, no doubt

1527
00:44:31,190 --> 00:44:31,920
You know

1528
00:44:32,050 --> 00:44:32,400
Yes?

1529
00:44:32,510 --> 00:44:34,530
I don't really have comedic skills because I'm just a mere actor

1530
00:44:34,530 --> 00:44:36,390
I don't really have comedic skills because I'm just a mere actor

1531
00:44:36,470 --> 00:44:37,700
But now that you ask me, I feel intrigued

1532
00:44:37,700 --> 00:44:39,360
But now that you ask me, I feel intrigued

1533
00:44:39,390 --> 00:44:39,860
Eh?

1534
00:44:39,990 --> 00:44:42,580
Negotiation ended

1535
00:44:40,020 --> 00:44:40,450
Thanks a lot

1536
00:44:40,820 --> 00:44:41,380
Eh?

1537
00:44:41,380 --> 00:44:42,820
Ehhh?!

1538
00:44:43,670 --> 00:44:45,890
The next person we discussed with is the following

1539
00:44:46,710 --> 00:44:47,190
'Morning

1540
00:44:47,230 --> 00:44:49,010
Good morning

1541
00:44:49,010 --> 00:44:51,510
It's a pleasure to work with you

1542
00:44:49,670 --> 00:44:50,790
It's a pleasure

1543
00:44:54,550 --> 00:44:57,540
MMMMMMMMMMMMMMMM

1544
00:44:54,910 --> 00:44:57,510
Kameda Shiro

1545
00:44:58,210 --> 00:45:02,790
A trainer-dad who raised his three sons to become world champions of boxing

1546
00:45:04,100 --> 00:45:08,630
The face he shows during matches or such is just like that of a demon

1547
00:45:09,180 --> 00:45:10,580
Are you wearing a goddamn diaper, you dumbass?!

1548
00:45:10,580 --> 00:45:11,520
Are you wearing a goddamn diaper, you dumbass?!

1549
00:45:12,710 --> 00:45:15,540
Here's our discussion with a man who doesn't get jokes!

1550
00:45:16,430 --> 00:45:20,810
We're from "Downtown's Gaki no Tsukai", have you ever watched it?

1551
00:45:18,990 --> 00:45:20,800
We're from "Downtown's Gaki no Tsukai", have you ever watched it?

1552
00:45:20,050 --> 00:45:20,830
Yes, I have

1553
00:45:20,840 --> 00:45:23,650
Downtown, love 'em

1554
00:45:22,350 --> 00:45:22,790
Oh, really?

1555
00:45:22,790 --> 00:45:23,650
Yeah I love them

1556
00:45:24,030 --> 00:45:25,600
What impression did you get from Downtown?

1557
00:45:25,970 --> 00:45:28,150
They're funny, 'cause they're from Kansai, you know

1558
00:45:28,170 --> 00:45:29,540
And I'm from Kansai too, so I get what they're saying

1559
00:45:29,560 --> 00:45:31,590
And I'm from Kansai too, so I get what they're saying

1560
00:45:30,930 --> 00:45:32,210
And I'm from Kansai too, so I get what they're saying

1561
00:45:32,210 --> 00:45:34,290
I think Kansai dialect's rhythm is funny

1562
00:45:34,290 --> 00:45:37,300
Is Kansai the only reason you like Downtown?

1563
00:45:36,990 --> 00:45:38,990
That's---

1564
00:45:37,840 --> 00:45:40,100
Can't help it, it's hilarious 'cause it's in Kansai dialect

1565
00:45:37,960 --> 00:45:45,150
T/N: Many comedians come from the Kansai region where their dialect is blunt and straight to the point, unlike Tokyo dialect which sounds more polite and can be intentionally vague.

1566
00:45:38,990 --> 00:45:40,790
The way you say that...

1567
00:45:40,270 --> 00:45:42,070
That's kinda disrespectful

1568
00:45:40,700 --> 00:45:41,840
The one I like is actually Yamasaki Hosei

1569
00:45:41,840 --> 00:45:45,150
The one I like is actually Yamasaki Hosei

1570
00:45:43,910 --> 00:45:44,430
Is that so?

1571
00:45:44,370 --> 00:45:45,280
Yeah, between them

1572
00:45:45,460 --> 00:45:48,690
What do you like about Hosei-san?

1573
00:45:46,530 --> 00:45:48,880
I think he's friggin' funny

1574
00:45:49,060 --> 00:45:50,590
He's hilarious whatever he does or doesn't

1575
00:45:56,290 --> 00:45:57,070
That's an OUT, you know

1576
00:45:57,070 --> 00:45:57,630
Is he an idiot?

1577
00:45:57,790 --> 00:45:58,400
You're OUT

1578
00:45:58,400 --> 00:46:01,460
He's smiling so happily

1579
00:46:01,700 --> 00:46:04,160
You can do better than that!

1580
00:46:03,350 --> 00:46:03,920
I think he could

1581
00:46:05,170 --> 00:46:06,830
And so, our real question

1582
00:46:07,090 --> 00:46:10,550
Razor Ramon HG

1583
00:46:09,350 --> 00:46:10,230
Razor Ramon?

1584
00:46:11,200 --> 00:46:11,990
The one who goes "Foh", yeah?

1585
00:46:13,220 --> 00:46:15,570
You know I'm teaching boxing to lil' kids in Kansai

1586
00:46:15,590 --> 00:46:16,510
If I do this

1587
00:46:17,830 --> 00:46:20,500
I'll just be asked to do the "Foh!"

1588
00:46:20,500 --> 00:46:23,140
If the kids don't listen to me anymore, what am I gonna do?

1589
00:46:23,140 --> 00:46:26,150
You see, my reputation

1590
00:46:24,730 --> 00:46:26,150
I think with this

1591
00:46:26,150 --> 00:46:27,550
My reputation will go amiss

1592
00:46:27,710 --> 00:46:30,310
Negotiation ended

1593
00:46:31,380 --> 00:46:33,570
The next one undergoing our interview is this person

1594
00:46:33,570 --> 00:46:34,530
I wonder how this will turn out

1595
00:46:35,020 --> 00:46:37,060
Good morning, it's a pleasure to meet you

1596
00:46:35,940 --> 00:46:38,160
Good morning, it's a pleasure to meet you

1597
00:46:37,040 --> 00:46:37,380
Same here

1598
00:46:37,840 --> 00:46:38,270
What?

1599
00:46:40,610 --> 00:46:41,330
Thanks for being here

1600
00:46:41,760 --> 00:46:42,550
For real?!

1601
00:46:43,040 --> 00:46:44,430
How far are they going?

1602
00:46:46,370 --> 00:46:47,490
No way

1603
00:46:47,490 --> 00:46:48,690
Just how far?

1604
00:46:48,690 --> 00:46:49,710
Wait

1605
00:46:50,560 --> 00:46:51,470
It's the president

1606
00:46:51,920 --> 00:46:52,350
Ouch

1607
00:46:52,580 --> 00:46:53,300
The president

1608
00:46:53,300 --> 00:46:54,210
It's the company president!

1609
00:46:55,230 --> 00:46:57,440
She's a woman, you know

1610
00:46:56,500 --> 00:46:56,980
Yeah

1611
00:46:57,630 --> 00:47:02,230
MMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMM

1612
00:46:57,670 --> 00:47:02,230
Director of APA Hotel
Motoya Fumiko

1613
00:46:58,480 --> 00:47:00,030
Our next interview will be on President

1614
00:47:00,030 --> 00:47:01,910
Motoya Fumiko, director of APA Hotel

1615
00:47:02,340 --> 00:47:08,850
The President behind 438 Hotels in total in Japan

1616
00:47:03,170 --> 00:47:06,420
She's the woman leading the APA Hotel business,

1617
00:47:05,410 --> 00:47:06,860
Just amazing

1618
00:47:06,420 --> 00:47:08,530
which counts a huge business of structures in all Japan

1619
00:47:06,860 --> 00:47:08,660
Yes, impressive

1620
00:47:09,540 --> 00:47:12,930
APA Group Annual Turnover

1621
00:47:09,540 --> 00:47:12,930
The company's annual turnover is incredibly high, around a hundred billion yen!

1622
00:47:10,010 --> 00:47:12,930
110.5 billion yen

1623
00:47:10,010 --> 00:47:12,930
T/N: ¥110.5 billion is currently $1,005,550,000 USD (a little over a billion)

1624
00:47:13,730 --> 00:47:16,850
Have you ever heard of the "No Laughing" series?

1625
00:47:15,280 --> 00:47:16,910
Oh, "No Laughing" you said?.

1626
00:47:16,910 --> 00:47:18,190
Have you ever watched it?

1627
00:47:18,310 --> 00:47:19,040
Oh my yes, I have, it's a super popular tv show

1628
00:47:19,040 --> 00:47:20,160
Oh my yes, I have, it's a super popular tv show

1629
00:47:20,580 --> 00:47:22,390
The one in which if you laugh you're out, right?

1630
00:47:22,560 --> 00:47:22,850
Yes

1631
00:47:22,610 --> 00:47:23,340
The one where they're hit by a burdock root on their butt

1632
00:47:23,340 --> 00:47:26,640
The one where they're hit by a burdock root on their butt

1633
00:47:24,560 --> 00:47:24,980
A burdock root?

1634
00:47:25,010 --> 00:47:26,030
That one, right?

1635
00:47:26,420 --> 00:47:27,300
"Burdock"...

1636
00:47:27,310 --> 00:47:29,710
And here's our question

1637
00:47:29,710 --> 00:47:33,300
We were thinking about a disguise

1638
00:47:33,300 --> 00:47:33,830
Oh my

1639
00:47:34,870 --> 00:47:36,770
This is a tad extreme, isn't it?

1640
00:47:35,140 --> 00:47:36,820
What kind of situation is this...

1641
00:47:36,820 --> 00:47:38,580
I never really met him but I have seen him on television

1642
00:47:38,580 --> 00:47:42,070
I never really met him but I have seen him on television

1643
00:47:41,070 --> 00:47:41,410
Oh

1644
00:47:41,470 --> 00:47:41,730
Yes

1645
00:47:41,620 --> 00:47:42,080
I see

1646
00:47:42,090 --> 00:47:43,390
When it comes down to something we have to do, I believe it is my duty to do it for advertising purposes

1647
00:47:43,390 --> 00:47:46,420
When it comes down to something we have to do, I believe it is my duty to do it for advertising purposes

1648
00:47:46,420 --> 00:47:49,570
But given that I have the responsibility to improve our brand through advertisements

1649
00:47:49,570 --> 00:47:51,940
But given that I have the responsibility to improve our brand through advertisements

1650
00:47:51,090 --> 00:47:52,790
Well, that's reasonable

1651
00:47:52,180 --> 00:47:54,750
Thus I'm unsure

1652
00:47:54,690 --> 00:47:55,540
Makes sense

1653
00:47:54,720 --> 00:47:58,000
Negotiation ended

1654
00:47:56,720 --> 00:47:57,780
It's a bit tough

1655
00:47:57,780 --> 00:47:58,560
I wonder what will happen

1656
00:47:58,740 --> 00:48:03,670
And so, who will give consent to dress as Razor Ramon HG between them?

1657
00:48:03,770 --> 00:48:08,660
T/N: This commercial break has snuck into this version of the video. Sit back and enjoy this bit of Japanese TV culture or feel free to skip to 19:31

1658
00:48:05,070 --> 00:48:08,810
Let's go anywhere

1659
00:48:09,010 --> 00:48:11,440
Even if the path is harsh

1660
00:48:13,140 --> 00:48:20,370
As we whistle, let's keep running on

1661
00:48:21,180 --> 00:48:24,900
Happiness is waiting

1662
00:48:25,140 --> 00:48:28,840
From beyond the sky

1663
00:48:34,040 --> 00:48:34,960
Hot!

1664
00:48:34,980 --> 00:48:35,720
Huff, huff, huff

1665
00:48:36,090 --> 00:48:37,000
Ahh

1666
00:48:37,140 --> 00:48:37,900
Ahh

1667
00:48:38,090 --> 00:48:38,820
Mmmmmmh

1668
00:48:38,850 --> 00:48:39,340
Huff, huff, huff

1669
00:48:39,350 --> 00:48:40,740
Huff, huff, huff

1670
00:48:40,750 --> 00:48:41,580
Boiling and simmering

1671
00:48:41,700 --> 00:48:42,330
Ahh

1672
00:48:42,350 --> 00:48:44,350
Clear Asahi and today's hot pot

1673
00:48:44,420 --> 00:48:45,350
Aff yud ehpet (As you'd expect)

1674
00:48:45,420 --> 00:48:47,050
Aff yud ehpet vrom za mahihrate (As you'd expect from the magistrate)

1675
00:48:47,170 --> 00:48:48,710
It's black huh?

1676
00:48:49,170 --> 00:48:50,680
Top class richness and

1677
00:48:52,260 --> 00:48:53,590
Top class fragrance on

1678
00:48:55,360 --> 00:48:56,900
A top class night

1679
00:48:58,010 --> 00:48:59,190
Wouldn't you?

1680
00:49:01,370 --> 00:49:03,630
No wonder it's 3 stars

1681
00:49:04,250 --> 00:49:05,930
This is a huge line!

1682
00:49:05,930 --> 00:49:07,230
It's that kind of season

1683
00:49:07,240 --> 00:49:08,740
Huh? Kin-chan?

1684
00:49:08,740 --> 00:49:09,770
I've been in line for 3 days

1685
00:49:09,830 --> 00:49:10,630
What are you looking for?

1686
00:49:10,660 --> 00:49:12,170
The kind of love that's precisely for me

1687
00:49:12,210 --> 00:49:13,490
He's talking about love...

1688
00:49:13,500 --> 00:49:14,780
I'm really looking forward to "the one"

1689
00:49:14,780 --> 00:49:18,480
Introducing: iPhone X
At au, it's 50% off

1690
00:49:18,980 --> 00:49:20,380
Precise, precise, precise, precise, precise, precise,

1691
00:49:20,390 --> 00:49:21,620
What's going on?
Precise, precise, precise, precise, precise, precise,

1692
00:49:21,620 --> 00:49:24,390
Precise, precise, precise, precise, precise, precise,

1693
00:49:24,410 --> 00:49:25,300
Wanna go out?

1694
00:49:25,890 --> 00:49:26,560
Sure

1695
00:49:26,880 --> 00:49:27,560
Huh?

1696
00:49:27,610 --> 00:49:28,260
Does that mean...
It's a yes?

1697
00:49:28,260 --> 00:49:29,350
Does that mean...
It's a yes?

1698
00:49:29,350 --> 00:49:31,250
Precise, precise...

1699
00:49:31,250 --> 00:49:33,610
Our Precise Plan with a smartphone

1700
00:49:35,800 --> 00:49:40,490
And so, who will give consent to dress as Razor Ramon HG between them?

1701
00:49:38,580 --> 00:49:41,250
Maaaan, this is just...!

1702
00:49:41,810 --> 00:49:45,630
Ok, Matsumoto-san, please answer this question!

1703
00:49:43,370 --> 00:49:44,670
I have to pick??

1704
00:49:44,730 --> 00:49:45,780
Looks like it became a quiz

1705
00:49:45,810 --> 00:49:47,050
Eh? What should I do?

1706
00:49:48,030 --> 00:49:49,550
Well considering the enthusiasm they show, probably the unexpected Nenji-san was the one who seemed likely

1707
00:49:49,550 --> 00:49:50,850
Well considering the enthusiasm they show, probably the unexpected Nenji-san was the one who seemed likely

1708
00:49:50,850 --> 00:49:51,510
Well considering the enthusiasm they show, probably the unexpected Nenji-san was the one who seemed likely

1709
00:49:51,510 --> 00:49:55,010
Well considering the enthusiasm they show, probably the unexpected Nenji-san was the one who seemed likely

1710
00:49:54,090 --> 00:49:55,130
Yeah, he was positive about this

1711
00:49:55,240 --> 00:49:57,310
So I say Kobayashi Nenji-san!!

1712
00:49:57,380 --> 00:49:57,830
Eh?

1713
00:49:57,410 --> 00:50:00,330
Correct Answer: Now Entering

1714
00:49:58,440 --> 00:50:00,210
Ehhhhh?

1715
00:50:00,630 --> 00:50:02,250
Okay! Okay!

1716
00:50:02,650 --> 00:50:04,170
Okay! O~kay!

1717
00:50:04,370 --> 00:50:05,530
OKAAAYY!!

1718
00:50:05,530 --> 00:50:09,050
Razor Ramon Hard Gay





Kameda Shiro

1719
00:50:06,130 --> 00:50:09,050
I'm doing it, can you believe it!?

1720
00:50:09,260 --> 00:50:10,720
The backbone of the Kameda family has arrived!!

1721
00:50:10,720 --> 00:50:11,770
The backbone of the Kameda family has arrived!!

1722
00:50:11,770 --> 00:50:13,310
The backbone of the Kameda family has arrived!!

1723
00:50:13,810 --> 00:50:15,310
Here we go!!

1724
00:50:15,310 --> 00:50:16,980
Kameda Shiro FOOH~!!

1725
00:50:16,980 --> 00:50:19,350
Kameda Shiro FOOH~!!

1726
00:50:19,350 --> 00:50:20,510
Thanks!!

1727
00:50:20,510 --> 00:50:22,860
No matter how you look at it, I'm the Osakan Hard Gay!!

1728
00:50:22,860 --> 00:50:23,880
No matter how you look at it, I'm the Osakan Hard Gay!!

1729
00:50:23,880 --> 00:50:25,790
No matter how you look at it, I'm the Osakan Hard Gay!!

1730
00:50:25,790 --> 00:50:26,490
Everyone, do you think this is funny?

1731
00:50:26,490 --> 00:50:28,390
Everyone, do you think this is funny?

1732
00:50:28,390 --> 00:50:29,590
I'm not doing anything terribly dangerous

1733
00:50:29,590 --> 00:50:32,390
I'm not doing anything terribly dangerous

1734
00:50:33,330 --> 00:50:35,560
Okaay!!

1735
00:50:35,560 --> 00:50:36,710
I'm the world champion Hard Gay, FOOH~!!

1736
00:50:36,710 --> 00:50:38,030
I'm the world champion Hard Gay, FOOH~!!

1737
00:50:38,030 --> 00:50:40,760
I'm the world champion Hard Gay, FOOH~!!

1738
00:50:40,760 --> 00:50:42,720
Okay okay

1739
00:50:44,210 --> 00:50:46,810
How many times is he gonna say okay??

1740
00:50:49,160 --> 00:50:51,910
That surprised me

1741
00:50:52,050 --> 00:50:54,730
Yeah, I wouldn't have expected that old guy to come...

1742
00:50:55,010 --> 00:50:56,150
That was interesting

1743
00:51:01,150 --> 00:51:02,660
He didn't seem to indicate any sort of interest in doing it

1744
00:51:02,660 --> 00:51:04,520
He didn't seem to indicate any sort of interest in doing it

1745
00:51:04,520 --> 00:51:07,130
A lot must have happened behind the scenes

1746
00:51:09,930 --> 00:51:12,530
That was pretty amusing

1747
00:51:13,230 --> 00:51:15,660
That's the first time I've ever seen an old guy be that energetic

1748
00:51:15,660 --> 00:51:18,270
He kept saying "okay okay"

1749
00:51:22,010 --> 00:51:23,110
You laughed then

1750
00:51:23,310 --> 00:51:24,580
Hard Gay never said "Okay" all that often, right?

1751
00:51:24,580 --> 00:51:26,780
Hard Gay never said "Okay" all that often, right?

1752
00:51:28,110 --> 00:51:31,020
Say Say Say Fooh~!!

1753
00:51:31,020 --> 00:51:34,490
Should I go?

1754
00:51:32,230 --> 00:51:32,970
Yeah

1755
00:51:33,390 --> 00:51:34,490
Here we go...

1756
00:51:35,590 --> 00:51:36,050
Ahh

1757
00:51:37,060 --> 00:51:37,710
Nothing

1758
00:51:37,060 --> 00:51:40,070
There's not a lot in these

1759
00:51:38,230 --> 00:51:40,070
Recently Endo has…

1760
00:51:42,380 --> 00:51:43,840
It's here

1761
00:51:43,760 --> 00:51:47,350
Key #2

1762
00:51:47,760 --> 00:51:48,790
What is it?

1763
00:51:49,930 --> 00:51:51,780
Number 2?

1764
00:51:50,950 --> 00:51:51,470
This is Number 2

1765
00:51:51,640 --> 00:51:52,270
Over there

1766
00:51:52,290 --> 00:51:53,110
Here

1767
00:51:53,110 --> 00:51:55,770
Locker #2

1768
00:51:53,310 --> 00:51:55,750
This is kinda scary

1769
00:51:55,550 --> 00:51:56,750
It's pretty big

1770
00:51:56,750 --> 00:51:58,110
Yeah, no kidding

1771
00:51:58,110 --> 00:52:01,640
For sure, I'm tired of this

1772
00:52:07,850 --> 00:52:08,960
Here we go

1773
00:52:14,190 --> 00:52:15,180
Huge!

1774
00:52:15,190 --> 00:52:21,700
Mystery Confiscated Box

1775
00:52:19,350 --> 00:52:20,770
So it's this kind of setup

1776
00:52:22,510 --> 00:52:24,330
It's a heavy case

1777
00:52:24,670 --> 00:52:27,540
I wonder if we should see it too?

1778
00:52:27,540 --> 00:52:29,660
Might be that I'm the only one who should see it...

1779
00:52:29,660 --> 00:52:31,980
Might be that I'm the only one who should see it...

1780
00:52:46,960 --> 00:52:49,260
What kind of thing is it?

1781
00:52:49,260 --> 00:52:52,400
Is it something that you would use?

1782
00:52:52,960 --> 00:52:54,870
We should each look at it one by one

1783
00:52:55,110 --> 00:52:57,030
Since Hamada knows me better…

1784
00:52:58,700 --> 00:53:01,940
It's probably related to Endo's history

1785
00:53:00,270 --> 00:53:02,260
Yeah it is, isn't it

1786
00:53:07,860 --> 00:53:09,270
What? What? What?

1787
00:53:10,420 --> 00:53:12,550
You put it on your head, right?

1788
00:53:14,320 --> 00:53:15,620
What What What?

1789
00:53:15,520 --> 00:53:16,930
I'm getting scared

1790
00:53:16,960 --> 00:53:20,160
Probably best to look the other way and put it on

1791
00:53:21,070 --> 00:53:22,210
So I, uh...

1792
00:53:22,260 --> 00:53:24,460
There's another part to this

1793
00:53:24,460 --> 00:53:26,930
So I would like to try it once

1794
00:53:27,130 --> 00:53:28,210
Sorry, my apologies

1795
00:53:27,930 --> 00:53:29,800
It's something he uses

1796
00:53:30,800 --> 00:53:31,710
It's not something you look at, it's for Endo's use!!

1797
00:53:31,710 --> 00:53:34,640
It's not something you look at, it's for Endo's use!!

1798
00:53:34,690 --> 00:53:35,710
I'm starting

1799
00:53:35,100 --> 00:53:36,370
Yeah, you'll see

1800
00:53:41,380 --> 00:53:44,480
It's Hiromi Chan

1801
00:53:45,350 --> 00:53:47,690
T/N: Iwasaki Hiromi is a J-Pop singer who debuted in 1975.

1802
00:53:45,350 --> 00:53:47,690
That's Iwasaki Hiromi, right?

1803
00:53:46,550 --> 00:53:47,420
Yeah

1804
00:53:48,620 --> 00:53:49,850
Cinderella Honeymoon

1805
00:53:56,900 --> 00:54:02,530
Anyone Can Be Iwasaki Hiromi Set

1806
00:53:59,710 --> 00:54:01,010
Looks just like her!

1807
00:54:03,010 --> 00:54:05,230
It's just like Korokke-san's acting

1808
00:54:03,010 --> 00:54:06,810
T/N: Korokke is a singer, actor, and comedian who specializes in doing impressions. He has appeared in the Spy Batsu.

1809
00:54:05,230 --> 00:54:06,810
Yes, it's just like Korokke-san!

1810
00:54:06,010 --> 00:54:08,110
Why Endo though?!

1811
00:54:12,010 --> 00:54:13,950
Of course we're gonna laugh at something like that!!

1812
00:54:14,460 --> 00:54:15,990
This is crazy

1813
00:54:16,260 --> 00:54:17,580
Do they even sell those?

1814
00:54:17,580 --> 00:54:18,910
Are they sold, I wonder

1815
00:54:18,910 --> 00:54:20,910
This has to be custom made

1816
00:54:20,910 --> 00:54:22,910
This is really well done

1817
00:54:22,910 --> 00:54:24,910
Anyone can be Hiromi-Chan

1818
00:54:27,230 --> 00:54:28,630
This was all I found

1819
00:54:30,500 --> 00:54:31,590
Hey Yamazaki, you wanna go next?

1820
00:54:31,590 --> 00:54:33,930
Tanaka's just going to get a DVD anyway…

1821
00:54:33,930 --> 00:54:35,770
Well… I hope not…

1822
00:54:35,800 --> 00:54:37,240
Well, since Matsumoto got one

1823
00:54:38,070 --> 00:54:40,670
Oh I have one too…

1824
00:54:38,980 --> 00:54:39,710
It's a key

1825
00:54:39,610 --> 00:54:40,500
It's a key

1826
00:54:40,670 --> 00:54:43,110
Key #1

1827
00:54:43,810 --> 00:54:45,910
Number 1

1828
00:54:44,530 --> 00:54:46,080
Key number 1

1829
00:54:52,950 --> 00:54:54,050
Noo!

1830
00:54:54,050 --> 00:54:56,150
It's the same

1831
00:54:56,150 --> 00:55:02,130
Mystery Confiscated Box

1832
00:54:59,160 --> 00:55:00,190
Who is it gonna be?

1833
00:55:00,190 --> 00:55:02,030
Who IS it going to be?

1834
00:55:02,030 --> 00:55:04,030
If you look at the precedent

1835
00:55:03,150 --> 00:55:04,740
Tanaka could you come over here…

1836
00:55:04,740 --> 00:55:06,740
Yeah that's a good idea…

1837
00:55:05,640 --> 00:55:07,300
Yeah, I might see it on accident

1838
00:55:07,440 --> 00:55:09,060
You wear it, right?

1839
00:55:09,830 --> 00:55:10,490
Is it?

1840
00:55:10,440 --> 00:55:13,200
Yes

1841
00:55:10,820 --> 00:55:12,590
Who?

1842
00:55:12,590 --> 00:55:13,690
Let's look this way…

1843
00:55:15,260 --> 00:55:16,430
Wearing it is better…

1844
00:55:16,430 --> 00:55:17,270
Yeah

1845
00:55:19,480 --> 00:55:20,450
Huh?

1846
00:55:21,710 --> 00:55:24,320
What is this song?

1847
00:55:24,720 --> 00:55:26,150
Who sang this song?

1848
00:55:26,150 --> 00:55:27,650
Mikawa-san

1849
00:55:36,660 --> 00:55:38,760
Just wearing it is good enough

1850
00:55:43,840 --> 00:55:45,480
This one was good too

1851
00:55:45,500 --> 00:55:49,540
Anyone Can Be Kenichi Mikawa Set

1852
00:55:45,500 --> 00:55:49,540
T/N: Kenichi Mikawa is a Japanese enka singer who was popular in the 60's and 70's.

1853
00:55:49,540 --> 00:55:52,210
That face pisses me off!!

1854
00:55:52,740 --> 00:55:54,480
It really resembles him!!

1855
00:55:54,480 --> 00:55:55,550
It really does!

1856
00:55:56,710 --> 00:55:59,200
It's Korokke-san, doing an impression of Mikawa-san

1857
00:55:59,150 --> 00:56:00,720
That's kinda scary…

1858
00:56:08,110 --> 00:56:10,160
I realized too late...

1859
00:56:10,460 --> 00:56:12,850
You've hurt yourself this time

1860
00:56:16,030 --> 00:56:20,670
This is really expensive, right?

1861
00:56:17,920 --> 00:56:20,560
Definitely expensive

1862
00:56:21,170 --> 00:56:23,170
I should display Iwasaki's too

1863
00:56:23,170 --> 00:56:24,940
There's a third one

1864
00:56:24,940 --> 00:56:30,720
Locker #3

1865
00:56:25,150 --> 00:56:29,420
Since Matsumoto had the DVDs, maybe Tanaka has...

1866
00:56:29,420 --> 00:56:31,930
I might have the third one, guessing by the flow of things

1867
00:56:35,350 --> 00:56:37,090
Hey Endo

1868
00:56:38,190 --> 00:56:40,990
That angle... Could you stop it?

1869
00:56:41,760 --> 00:56:43,730
Could you face them the other way?

1870
00:56:45,060 --> 00:56:47,330
Let's line them up?

1871
00:56:45,770 --> 00:56:47,230
Put them in the boxes

1872
00:56:47,230 --> 00:56:49,230
Yes yes, please

1873
00:56:49,230 --> 00:56:51,230
They're so well made, so better to show them

1874
00:56:53,070 --> 00:56:55,510
Ohhhhhh heh heh…

1875
00:56:59,410 --> 00:57:01,710
That's not fair

1876
00:57:03,150 --> 00:57:04,900
Korokke-san is too powerful

1877
00:57:05,110 --> 00:57:06,130
Amazing

1878
00:57:07,990 --> 00:57:08,950
Let's stop this…

1879
00:57:08,910 --> 00:57:11,250
The combination of these two...

1880
00:57:11,060 --> 00:57:14,290
Please put them back in the boxes!

1881
00:57:13,010 --> 00:57:14,410
Put them away

1882
00:57:14,430 --> 00:57:17,730
Okay, should you go Tanaka?

1883
00:57:16,750 --> 00:57:17,990
Yeah, I'll open

1884
00:57:17,810 --> 00:57:20,910
Sasoriza no onna~

1885
00:57:17,990 --> 00:57:20,910
T/N: The song that Matsumoto is singing is "Sasoriza no Onna" ("Scorpio Woman"), which is one of Kenichi Mikawa's hit song.

1886
00:57:22,900 --> 00:57:23,740
Really?

1887
00:57:25,520 --> 00:57:26,240
A DVD…

1888
00:57:26,240 --> 00:57:26,880
Here it is!

1889
00:57:26,800 --> 00:57:32,910
Mystery DVD 1

1890
00:57:28,760 --> 00:57:31,030
I thought that because Matsumoto had one…

1891
00:57:31,030 --> 00:57:31,710
It says "1" on it

1892
00:57:31,710 --> 00:57:33,030
It's labeled, "DVD 1"

1893
00:57:33,030 --> 00:57:34,010
That's true

1894
00:57:35,780 --> 00:57:40,420
Mystery DVD 2

1895
00:57:39,030 --> 00:57:40,470
An attack on Tanaka

1896
00:57:41,490 --> 00:57:43,890
It wouldn't be a real Batsu without these, y'know…

1897
00:57:44,390 --> 00:57:47,360
It could be another Appearance OK Derby

1898
00:57:48,660 --> 00:57:50,800
Yeah, it could be something completely different too

1899
00:57:52,410 --> 00:57:53,270
Starting from the first

1900
00:57:53,670 --> 00:57:54,940
Please cut this out

1901
00:57:55,360 --> 00:57:59,840
This DVD is a detective simulation game

1902
00:58:00,960 --> 00:58:06,690
Please select the best answer that will solve the case with A or B

1903
00:58:06,690 --> 00:58:07,690
It's all on you, Tanaka

1904
00:58:06,690 --> 00:58:10,680
You are the only one who decides the outcome

1905
00:58:08,610 --> 00:58:09,690
Me?

1906
00:58:11,950 --> 00:58:14,520
Game Start

1907
00:58:17,990 --> 00:58:21,530
Heir to the Inn

1908
00:58:17,990 --> 00:58:21,530
Satomi

1909
00:58:32,590 --> 00:58:35,570
Satomi








Why…?

1910
00:58:40,360 --> 00:58:45,900
Long Standing Inn

1911
00:58:40,360 --> 00:58:45,900
Steaming Murder Mystery

1912
00:58:43,150 --> 00:58:45,900
Investigation Begin

1913
00:58:47,350 --> 00:58:57,950
Tanaka

1914
00:58:47,740 --> 00:58:48,670
My name is Tanaka Naoki.

1915
00:58:49,000 --> 00:58:50,510
I'm a field detective for Itohama Police Station.

1916
00:58:50,510 --> 00:58:56,090
This case has a very troublesome smell about it…

1917
00:58:56,990 --> 00:58:57,950
Can I help you?

1918
00:59:01,400 --> 00:59:03,670
Please wait a moment!

1919
00:59:04,000 --> 00:59:05,150
Tanaka-senpai

1920
00:59:05,770 --> 00:59:08,100
Could you not leave before me?

1921
00:59:09,110 --> 00:59:12,540
Understudy Detective










Nakamura Shunsuke

1922
00:59:10,070 --> 00:59:12,540
Why do you leave me behind?

1923
00:59:13,030 --> 00:59:16,460
But, a murder at such a reputable hot springs inn is just…

1924
00:59:17,030 --> 00:59:18,640
Just what could have happened…

1925
00:59:21,400 --> 00:59:27,670
Anyway, this case's first witness is the inn's Senior Hostess

1926
00:59:27,670 --> 00:59:29,310
Let's go ahead and get her

1927
00:59:29,310 --> 00:59:30,950
Excuse me!

1928
00:59:30,950 --> 00:59:31,720
Yes!

1929
00:59:34,550 --> 00:59:35,580
Welcome

1930
00:59:35,580 --> 00:59:42,440
Senior Hostess








Akimoto Naomi

1931
00:59:36,650 --> 00:59:39,470
Thank you for coming from so far away

1932
00:59:42,840 --> 00:59:42,840
Tanaka

1933
00:59:42,840 --> 00:59:47,110
This is the inn's senior hostess, Akimoto Naomi

1934
00:59:47,110 --> 00:59:52,850
She managed the inn with the murdered heir, Satomi, along with 2 others

1935
00:59:58,150 --> 01:00:00,190
Sorry to get straight to the point, but…

1936
01:00:00,380 --> 01:00:03,570
Could you tell us the details of how you found the body?

1937
01:00:03,920 --> 01:00:08,220
I found her in the middle of the night at 2am

1938
01:00:09,530 --> 01:00:13,510
It was a matter of hours. Prior to that she was happily doing her work

1939
01:00:15,120 --> 01:00:19,870
Did you notice anything weird about her recently?

1940
01:00:21,310 --> 01:00:28,630
Now that you mention it, she has been arguing with a fellow waitress

1941
01:00:31,930 --> 01:00:33,870
Even if I were joking, you're the heir!

1942
01:00:33,870 --> 01:00:37,290
How can you have such an attitude in front of customers!?

1943
01:00:38,660 --> 01:00:41,600
Huh?

1944
01:00:40,590 --> 01:00:41,970
What is the matter?

1945
01:00:45,970 --> 01:00:47,940
Doesn't it stink?

1946
01:00:48,070 --> 01:00:51,360
It could be that dirty detective

1947
01:00:52,450 --> 01:00:54,030
You smell like garbage

1948
01:00:55,700 --> 01:00:57,770
Do you regularly shower?

1949
01:01:02,910 --> 01:01:05,270
Just end it right there

1950
01:01:08,360 --> 01:01:10,760
That's a painful line isn't it?

1951
01:01:10,760 --> 01:01:12,300
Yeah… So rude

1952
01:01:12,470 --> 01:01:14,070
You smell like garbage

1953
01:01:15,750 --> 01:01:17,900
Do you regularly shower?

1954
01:01:19,910 --> 01:01:21,190
Never mind that Tanaka-senpai

1955
01:01:21,480 --> 01:01:22,890
What will you do next?

1956
01:01:22,090 --> 01:01:23,030
Never mind that

1957

1960
01:01:23,680 --> 01:01:40,000

You have to do it with feeling

1965

Please let me meet with the waitress you mentioned

1966
01:01:37,230 --> 01:01:40,000

She should be in the communal bath

1969
01:01:47,970 --> 01:01:50,270
This is the scene of the murder, right?

1970
01:01:50,890 --> 01:01:52,370
That's right... huh?

1971
01:01:52,920 --> 01:01:54,280
Only our new recruit is here

1972
01:01:55,040 --> 01:01:56,130
Sorry to interrupt

1973
01:02:01,520 --> 01:02:02,080
Hello?

1974
01:02:04,170 --> 01:02:05,690
I understand, I'll be right there

1975
01:02:06,560 --> 01:02:07,190
What's wrong?

1976
01:02:08,010 --> 01:02:11,480
Apparently our cook and driver are having an argument in the kitchen

1977
01:02:12,340 --> 01:02:13,610
Senpai, let's go

1978
01:02:12,390 --> 01:02:14,010
This is interesting

1979
01:02:14,700 --> 01:02:16,650
Rookie, you should come too!

1980
01:02:22,290 --> 01:02:23,000
Stop it!

1981
01:02:24,120 --> 01:02:24,960
That hurts!

1982
01:02:25,260 --> 01:02:26,310
What are you doing!?

1983
01:02:26,280 --> 01:02:30,150
Driver

1984
01:02:26,280 --> 01:02:30,150
Hotaru Yukijiro

1985
01:02:26,470 --> 01:02:27,440
You can't fool me

1986
01:02:27,980 --> 01:02:30,010
You're the one who murdered Satomi-chan!

1987
01:02:30,010 --> 01:02:32,010
This is an amazing cast

1988
01:02:30,150 --> 01:02:32,710
Cook

1989
01:02:30,150 --> 01:02:32,710
Murata Takehiro

1990
01:02:30,330 --> 01:02:31,060
Shut up!

1991
01:02:31,110 --> 01:02:32,750
How long will you keep saying that?

1992
01:02:33,750 --> 01:02:35,970
Stop it, both of you!

1993
01:02:35,970 --> 01:02:38,390
Stop it! Rookie, help me stop them!

1994
01:02:38,620 --> 01:02:40,420
Stop it!

1995
01:02:40,420 --> 01:02:44,490
Nakajima Hiroko

1996
01:02:40,420 --> 01:02:44,490
Waitress

1997
01:02:40,710 --> 01:02:41,610
Stop it already!

1998
01:02:42,570 --> 01:02:44,080
I know everything

1999
01:02:46,600 --> 01:02:50,380
Murata-san, even though you have a wife, you had an affair with Satomi

2000
01:02:52,370 --> 01:02:53,230
What are you saying?

2001
01:02:53,400 --> 01:02:54,490
And on top of that

2002
01:02:54,670 --> 01:02:57,790
You even got her to repay your debts

2003
01:03:00,940 --> 01:03:02,190
You killed her, right?

2004
01:03:03,090 --> 01:03:06,310
When the woman who had always done what you wanted tried to break up with you

2005
01:03:06,310 --> 01:03:08,430
You lost your temper and killed her, right?

2006
01:03:12,500 --> 01:03:14,500
Wh...y...?

2007
01:03:24,550 --> 01:03:28,600
Newbie Cleaner

2008
01:03:24,550 --> 01:03:28,600
Thai Kick

2009
01:03:24,650 --> 01:03:24,930
Huh?

2010
01:03:30,010 --> 01:03:32,610
What is this? "Thai Kick"...?

2011
01:03:35,590 --> 01:03:36,290
Thai Kick-san

2012
01:03:36,390 --> 01:03:36,910
Stop it!

2013
01:03:37,550 --> 01:03:38,450
Thai Kick-san

2014
01:03:39,260 --> 01:03:40,970
Shut up, if it's come to this...

2015
01:03:41,620 --> 01:03:42,870
I'll escape no matter what

2016
01:03:52,490 --> 01:03:54,060
It's the climax

2017
01:03:58,980 --> 01:04:00,640
Stop resisting and turn yourself in

2018
01:04:01,350 --> 01:04:03,050
Why would I turn myself in now?

2019
01:04:03,590 --> 01:04:04,710
Get a car ready

2020
01:04:04,970 --> 01:04:07,410
If you don't hurry up, I will kill him

2021
01:04:09,840 --> 01:04:11,730
Tanaka-senpai... What should we do?

2022
01:04:12,780 --> 01:04:25,670
Put down your guns and negotiate

2023
01:04:12,780 --> 01:04:25,670

2024
01:04:12,780 --> 01:04:27,630
Shoot!

2025
01:04:12,780 --> 01:04:27,630
Choice 2

※Please read and choose with your gut feeling

2029
01:04:16,490 --> 01:04:19,090
This is hard

2030
01:04:19,050 --> 01:04:20,660
This is a hard one

2031
01:04:20,660 --> 01:04:22,220
I think even so...

2032
01:04:25,590 --> 01:04:27,210
Put down your guns and negotiate

2033
01:04:25,670 --> 01:04:27,630
Put down your guns and negotiate

2034
01:04:25,670 --> 01:04:27,630

2035
01:04:34,440 --> 01:04:35,040
I got it

2036
01:04:36,550 --> 01:04:37,270
Let's talk

2037
01:04:38,360 --> 01:04:39,970
We don't have anything to talk about

2038
01:04:40,690 --> 01:04:42,940
Quickly... Get a car ready

2039
01:04:52,450 --> 01:04:53,000
Senpai...

2040
01:04:52,960 --> 01:04:56,790
Tanaka

2041
01:04:53,160 --> 01:04:56,790
Let's arrest him!

2042
01:05:00,410 --> 01:05:01,910
You're arrested on suspicion of murder

2043
01:05:08,850 --> 01:05:09,750
Thai Kick!

2044
01:05:12,320 --> 01:05:13,220
Thai Kick...

2045
01:05:13,110 --> 01:05:15,030
I'm so glad! So glad!

2046
01:05:14,480 --> 01:05:17,050
They keep calling him Thai Kick-san...

2047
01:05:17,510 --> 01:05:25,390
T/N: "Thai Kick-san" is speaking in Thai.

2048
01:05:17,510 --> 01:05:25,390
Thai Kick

2049
01:05:17,910 --> 01:05:20,520
Thank you! Thank you!

2050
01:05:20,570 --> 01:05:25,390
It's all thanks to you!

2051
01:05:22,370 --> 01:05:25,150
It's good that you weren't hurt

2052
01:05:26,200 --> 01:05:27,590
Yeahhh

2053
01:05:28,010 --> 01:05:30,580
Now that it's all over, I feel quite hungry

2054
01:05:31,590 --> 01:05:32,040
Senpai

2055
01:05:32,940 --> 01:05:34,710
Shall we get some ramen on the way back?

2056
01:05:35,300 --> 01:05:38,480
Of course, it'll be your treat

2057
01:05:38,710 --> 01:05:42,000
Hahaha

2058
01:05:38,710 --> 01:05:42,000
Tanaka

2059
01:05:42,000 --> 01:05:50,180
Thai Kick

2060
01:05:42,300 --> 01:05:50,180
Quit laughing Tanaka! The case may be solved but

2061
01:05:42,300 --> 01:05:50,180
m 0 0 l -1650 0 l -1650 -202.5 l 0 -202.5 l 0 0

2062
01:05:45,670 --> 01:05:50,180
1 person died! You're in for a thai kick!

2063
01:05:54,380 --> 01:05:55,430
This is crazy

2064
01:05:56,190 --> 01:05:59,620
Ah, Thai Kick-san is here

2065
01:05:59,900 --> 01:06:00,920
Isn't this crazy?

2066
01:06:01,290 --> 01:06:01,760
Really

2067
01:06:02,160 --> 01:06:05,490
Of all the thai kicks up until now, isn't this the cruelest?

2068
01:06:05,630 --> 01:06:06,630
It's dangerous

2069
01:06:06,830 --> 01:06:08,060
You shouldn't move around

2070
01:06:08,530 --> 01:06:11,730
Maybe you made a mistake somewhere?

2071
01:06:09,810 --> 01:06:11,070
That's right, one of your choices

2072
01:06:10,670 --> 01:06:11,980
Yeah, amongst the A B, A B

2073
01:06:12,000 --> 01:06:14,670
You should've shot him!!

2074
01:06:13,270 --> 01:06:14,170
That's right

2075
01:06:14,170 --> 01:06:15,370
No, no, no, no, wait a sec

2076
01:06:15,370 --> 01:06:18,010
Do I have to get thai kicked for that?

2077
01:06:16,810 --> 01:06:18,410
Just stay still!

2078
01:06:18,120 --> 01:06:19,420
Your choice was wrong

2079
01:06:19,670 --> 01:06:21,110
Ouchhhhh!!

2080
01:06:21,480 --> 01:06:23,140
Ouchhhhh!!

2081
01:06:23,930 --> 01:06:25,110
That would've hurt

2082
01:06:25,110 --> 01:06:26,160
It hurt

2083
01:06:27,620 --> 01:06:29,270
What are you doing?

2084
01:06:33,400 --> 01:06:34,020
Ouch!

2085
01:06:39,930 --> 01:06:41,410
It hurts, doesn't it?

2086
01:06:41,510 --> 01:06:44,770
It hurts right? Every year, huh?

2087
01:06:45,350 --> 01:06:46,280
Ow

2088
01:06:45,730 --> 01:06:47,770
Me as well!?

2089
01:06:49,210 --> 01:06:52,240
It's such a turn off, Tanaka's reaction!!

2090
01:06:52,420 --> 01:06:53,470
It was perfect

2091
01:06:53,580 --> 01:06:54,080
That hurts

2092
01:06:54,080 --> 01:06:54,480
But...

2093
01:06:54,480 --> 01:06:57,310
It's like this all the time

2094
01:06:55,540 --> 01:06:58,030
Yeah, it's inevitable

2095
01:06:58,450 --> 01:06:58,960
Still...

2096
01:06:59,350 --> 01:07:03,090
Wasn't that harsh?

2097
01:07:00,160 --> 01:07:03,090
The leadup to the Thai Kick?

2098
01:07:01,450 --> 01:07:03,470
It's because you chose wrong

2099
01:07:03,470 --> 01:07:04,390
You chose wrong

2100
01:07:04,150 --> 01:07:06,960
You have to shoot. If you shot then, it would've been over!!

2101
01:07:09,520 --> 01:07:10,840
See! You chose wrong!

2102

Chapter Menu

2103
01:07:09,830 --> 01:07:23,500
Shoot!

2107
01:07:09,830 --> 01:07:24,610

2110
01:07:10,840 --> 01:07:12,840
You can choose once more!

2111
01:07:14,760 --> 01:07:16,430
Does this mean that I have to try once more?

2112
01:07:16,110 --> 01:07:17,730
I thought so

2113
01:07:17,870 --> 01:07:19,410
I thought it was the wrong answer

2114
01:07:19,430 --> 01:07:22,600
In this situation it's best to just shoot, you can't help it

2115
01:07:20,210 --> 01:07:22,570
It's best to shoot!!

2116
01:07:23,350 --> 01:07:24,170
Shoot!

2117
01:07:23,510 --> 01:07:24,610
Shoot!

2119
01:07:26,170 --> 01:07:27,110
I got it

2120
01:07:28,210 --> 01:07:29,540
I don't know how it will turn out

2121
01:07:31,000 --> 01:07:32,810
Thai Kick, get down!

2122
01:07:33,460 --> 01:07:34,350
Stop it!

2123
01:07:36,670 --> 01:07:37,240
He...

2124
01:07:38,070 --> 01:07:40,460
Killed Satomi-chan for my sake

2125
01:07:41,210 --> 01:07:42,420
Shut up Naomi!

2126
01:07:42,920 --> 01:07:43,790
He...

2127
01:07:44,490 --> 01:07:48,810
Shouldered my debt, and ended up going so far to repay it

2128
01:07:48,810 --> 01:07:49,410
Shut up!

2129
01:07:52,270 --> 01:07:52,780
This...

2130
01:07:53,530 --> 01:07:54,950
It's all my fault

2131
01:07:56,100 --> 01:07:57,620
Quickly, get a car ready!

2132
01:07:59,920 --> 01:08:00,840
This bit is the same

2133
01:08:01,390 --> 01:08:03,190
So this is the same

2134
01:08:04,660 --> 01:08:06,560
You!!

2135
01:08:06,460 --> 01:08:07,070
It's changed

2136
01:08:07,230 --> 01:08:08,320
You have to quickly shoot

2137
01:08:07,250 --> 01:08:07,930
It's different!

2138
01:08:08,030 --> 01:08:08,870
Watch out!

2139
01:08:11,150 --> 01:08:11,900
Stop it!

2140
01:08:13,450 --> 01:08:14,310
Watch out!

2141
01:08:19,740 --> 01:08:21,660
Thai Kick!

It was about the same amount of pain

2538
01:11:26,320 --> 01:11:26,920
But Tanaka, there is one more

2539
01:11:26,920 --> 01:11:29,160

01:12:21,840 --> 01:12:25,060
What the hell is going on here?!

2563
01:12:25,060 --> 01:12:27,600
Senior Hostess, explain this

2564
01:12:27,900 --> 01:12:29,480
I don't know

2565
01:12:29,480 --> 01:12:35,160
When I came to clean the public bath with Thai-Kick-san Hotaru-san was already lying there

2566
01:12:35,440 --> 01:12:40,260
For now, we'll inspect the scene of the crime

2567
01:12:40,300 --> 01:12:44,700
Nakamura

2568
01:12:40,730 --> 01:12:44,730
The name of the murderer must have been written here

2569
01:12:44,730 --> 01:13:12,030
m 0 0 l -742.5 0 l -742.5 -88.5 l 0 -88.5 l 0 0

2570
01:12:44,730 --> 01:13:14,100
Choice 3

2571
01:12:44,730 --> 01:13:14,100
The bath bucket is suspicious!

2572
01:12:44,730 --> 01:13:14,100
The bath towel is suspicious!

2573
01:12:44,730 --> 01:13:14,100
m 0 0 l -217.5 0 l -217.5 -60 l 0 -60 l 0 0

2574
01:12:44,730 --> 01:13:14,100
m 0 0 l -742.5 0 l -742.5 -88.5 l 0 -88.5 l 0 0

2575
01:12:44,730 --> 01:13:14,100
※Please read and choose with your gut feeling

2576
01:12:47,980 --> 01:12:50,200
This... I mean, let's...

2577
01:12:50,610 --> 01:12:53,640
Shouldn't we discuss this first?

2578
01:12:53,940 --> 01:12:57,610
This is a case of a dying message, right?

2579
01:12:55,460 --> 01:12:57,000
Yes

2580
01:12:57,610 --> 01:12:59,180
Under normal circumstances the towel would be obvious...

2581
01:12:59,180 --> 01:13:00,620
Under normal circumstances the towel would be obvious...

2582
01:13:00,640 --> 01:13:01,750
Exactly

2583
01:13:00,840 --> 01:13:03,300
Since the towel is long...

2584
01:13:01,750 --> 01:13:04,390
This choice is towel, right?

2585
01:13:03,300 --> 01:13:07,660
If we have to go with normal intuition. But there is also reverse logic

2586
01:13:04,390 --> 01:13:07,660
If we go normally, right?

2587
01:13:07,680 --> 01:13:09,360
Tanaka, you better choose one.

2588
01:13:08,420 --> 01:13:11,720
Going the orthodox route, I would say

2589
01:13:12,020 --> 01:13:13,440
the bath towel is suspicious

2590
01:13:12,030 --> 01:13:14,100
m 0 0 l -742.5 0 l -742.5 -88.5 l 0 -88.5 l 0 0

2591
01:13:13,440 --> 01:13:14,100
I see.

2592
01:13:27,890 --> 01:13:29,580
Hamada

2593
01:13:29,580 --> 01:13:31,100
Hamada

2594
01:13:30,210 --> 01:13:34,520
T/N: The character 田 is the same character for "Ta" in "Tanaka" and "Da" in "Hamada". Since it looks the same from all angles, it looked like it was going to say "Tanaka".

2595
01:13:31,100 --> 01:13:32,950
Hamada

2596
01:13:34,450 --> 01:13:36,120
Huh?

2597
01:13:37,160 --> 01:13:39,760
The culprit is Hamada

2598
01:13:39,760 --> 01:13:42,320
Thai Kick

2599
01:13:39,820 --> 01:13:42,320
Hamada Thai Kick!

2600
01:13:46,060 --> 01:13:48,190
No, no, no, no way!

2601
01:13:48,700 --> 01:13:51,370
You're kidding me!!

2602
01:13:51,370 --> 01:13:54,170
Tanaka, nice choice!!

2603
01:13:54,240 --> 01:13:56,780
Can't be

2604
01:13:56,780 --> 01:13:59,510
But it said so... Hamada was written there

2605
01:14:01,140 --> 01:14:01,540
No way!?

2606
01:14:01,540 --> 01:14:01,940
No way!?

2607
01:14:01,940 --> 01:14:03,110
No way!?

2608
01:14:02,320 --> 01:14:03,100
Wait a bit.

2609
01:14:03,580 --> 01:14:04,560
Do it gentl-

2610
01:14:04,560 --> 01:14:06,850
Ahhhhhh!!

2611
01:14:08,000 --> 01:14:10,050
Ahhhhhh!!

2612
01:14:16,580 --> 01:14:19,420
A face like that exists?

2613
01:14:23,910 --> 01:14:25,910
It hurts so bad...!

2614
01:14:26,840 --> 01:14:27,640
It's no longer just someone else's problem...

2615
01:14:27,640 --> 01:14:30,270
It's no longer just someone else's problem...

2616
01:14:30,320 --> 01:14:32,270
Well that's how it is

2617
01:14:31,340 --> 01:14:32,270
I guess you're right

2618
01:14:32,270 --> 01:14:33,260
Someone has to take it

2619
01:14:33,260 --> 01:14:34,360
That's true

2620
01:14:34,570 --> 01:14:36,360
Seems painful

2621
01:14:34,920 --> 01:14:36,360
It gets to you

2622
01:14:36,510 --> 01:14:37,880
What a...

2623
01:14:37,880 --> 01:14:41,980
What a face you're making.

2624
01:14:42,010 --> 01:14:45,220
It hurts it hurts it hurts...

2625
01:14:42,300 --> 01:14:44,420
Does it?

2626
01:14:44,420 --> 01:14:45,500
So it does hurt

2627
01:14:46,880 --> 01:14:49,100
This is becoming scary

2628
01:14:47,590 --> 01:15:02,540
m 0 0 l -742.5 0 l -742.5 -88.5 l 0 -88.5 l 0 0

2629
01:14:47,590 --> 01:15:05,510
Choice 3

2630
01:14:47,590 --> 01:15:05,510
The bath bucket is suspicious!

2631
01:14:47,590 --> 01:15:05,510
The bath towel is suspicious!

2632
01:14:47,590 --> 01:15:05,510
You can re-select once more

2633
01:14:47,590 --> 01:15:05,510
m 0 0 l -217.5 0 l -217.5 -60 l 0 -60 l 0 0

2634
01:14:47,590 --> 01:15:05,510
m 0 0 l -742.5 0 l -742.5 -88.5 l 0 -88.5 l 0 0

2635
01:14:49,100 --> 01:14:51,160
From there?

2636
01:14:51,160 --> 01:14:56,320
Please stop this

2637
01:14:53,040 --> 01:14:56,320
This can't be real

2638
01:14:56,320 --> 01:14:59,100
Isn't it enough now that Hamada is the culprit?

2639
01:14:59,100 --> 01:15:01,100
I will choose

2640
01:15:00,280 --> 01:15:02,580
I'm also scared of Hamada's facial reaction

2641
01:15:02,540 --> 01:15:05,510
m 0 0 l -742.5 0 l -742.5 -88.5 l 0 -88.5 l 0 0

2642
01:15:02,580 --> 01:15:04,460
The bath bucket is suspicious

2643
01:15:04,460 --> 01:15:05,510
We're counting you

2644
01:15:06,260 --> 01:15:09,860
I haven't felt this kind of pain in a long time

2645
01:15:11,840 --> 01:15:13,040
Please stop

2646
01:15:13,040 --> 01:15:14,220
This is the worst feeling

2647
01:15:14,220 --> 01:15:14,420
Tana-

2648
01:15:14,220 --> 01:15:17,520
Matsumoto

2649
01:15:16,880 --> 01:15:17,900
So direct

2650
01:15:17,900 --> 01:15:21,060
You are the next one. They are aiming for all of us

2651
01:15:18,620 --> 01:15:20,620
This decision determines the punishment

2652
01:15:21,060 --> 01:15:23,660
Matsumoto Thai Kick!

2653
01:15:21,060 --> 01:15:23,660
Thai Kick

2654
01:15:23,640 --> 01:15:25,660
Could you put a little
more thought into this?

2655
01:15:27,960 --> 01:15:30,100
Let's all make some space

2656
01:15:32,170 --> 01:15:34,540
For how long will this go on?

2657
01:15:36,660 --> 01:15:38,240
My breathing...

2658
01:15:38,240 --> 01:15:40,040
My breathing has stopped!

2659
01:15:40,080 --> 01:15:42,280
My breathing has stopped!

2660
01:15:40,100 --> 01:15:41,760
Quiet down

2661
01:15:41,760 --> 01:15:43,760
Quiet down already

2662
01:15:44,300 --> 01:15:45,880
Ahhhhh!!

2663
01:15:47,220 --> 01:15:48,680
Ahhhhh!!

2664
01:15:53,680 --> 01:15:55,690
Drool is coming out!!

2665
01:15:55,690 --> 01:15:57,830
Drool is coming out!!

2666
01:15:57,860 --> 01:15:59,640
What's up with this face.

2667
01:16:01,760 --> 01:16:02,300
My balls are gonna come off!!

2668
01:16:02,300 --> 01:16:03,300
My balls are gonna come off!!

2669
01:16:03,300 --> 01:16:05,030
My balls are gonna come off!!

2670
01:16:05,080 --> 01:16:06,500
Really??

2671
01:16:06,500 --> 01:16:08,140
No, really

2672
01:16:08,140 --> 01:16:10,480
It really hurt

2673
01:16:10,500 --> 01:16:11,660
That's right

2674
01:16:11,660 --> 01:16:13,360
Right in this moment

2675
01:16:12,240 --> 01:16:13,380
Yeah

2676
01:16:13,580 --> 01:16:16,150
You are so loud, jeez

2677
01:16:22,380 --> 01:16:23,290
My balls came off!!

2678
01:16:23,290 --> 01:16:25,150
My balls came off!!

2679
01:16:25,250 --> 01:16:26,920
My balls came off!!

2680
01:16:25,260 --> 01:16:26,940
You're fine, they're fine

2681
01:16:26,060 --> 01:16:27,840
They can't come off like that

2682
01:16:26,780 --> 01:16:27,840
It's fine

2683
01:16:27,840 --> 01:16:29,260
They are securely hanging on there

2684
01:16:31,520 --> 01:16:33,120
That looked like it hurt

2685
01:16:32,330 --> 01:16:34,900
True pain!!

2686
01:16:36,480 --> 01:16:38,420
3 hours since the beginning.

2687
01:16:37,090 --> 01:16:42,100
3 hours since the beginning

2688
01:16:37,400 --> 01:16:42,100
Even the 54 year old Downtown members have been shown no mercy

2689
01:16:38,420 --> 01:16:42,340
No mercy has been shown to the 54 year old Downtown members.

2690
01:16:42,340 --> 01:16:49,310
After this, the punishments won't get any lighter!!

2691
01:16:42,960 --> 01:16:44,780
However after this, the punishments won't get any easier

2692
01:16:44,780 --> 01:16:48,000
However after this, the punishments won't get any easier

2693
01:16:51,350 --> 01:16:55,920
Police station duties: 3 and a half hours

2694
01:16:51,720 --> 01:16:55,900
Serving at the police station for 3 and a half hours

2695
01:16:56,780 --> 01:17:00,380
There is no time for breaks for the beginners

2696
01:17:01,320 --> 01:17:02,800
Listen up, guys

2697
01:17:03,060 --> 01:17:05,460
To strengthen the bond between your American police partners

2698
01:17:05,460 --> 01:17:08,000
a recreational event has been arranged

2699
01:17:07,070 --> 01:17:08,740
There it is

2700
01:17:08,830 --> 01:17:12,130
Please change into these clothes and get ready

2701
01:17:10,340 --> 01:17:12,140
There it is

2702
01:17:12,920 --> 01:17:16,460
A recreational event with their fellow American Policemen

2703
01:17:14,160 --> 01:17:21,510
To strengthen the bond between fellow American policemen

they will participate in a recreational event!!

2705
01:17:17,180 --> 01:17:21,510

Auditorium

2707
01:17:22,100 --> 01:17:25,380
Everyone, from here on it will be a recreational event. So you can laugh

2708
01:17:25,210 --> 01:17:26,850
During recreation laughing is OK!!

2709

Special rule

2710
01:17:25,380 --> 01:17:26,850

Electric Shock

2738
01:17:57,150 --> 01:18:02,420

What?

2740
01:18:00,820 --> 01:18:02,420
Shocking... What?

2741
01:18:02,440 --> 01:18:06,420
We will make a representative from each team

2742
01:18:02,750 --> 01:18:12,630
A representative from each team will have
to compete in hand-pushing sumo to win.

2743
01:18:02,750 --> 01:18:12,630
m 0 0 l -1155 0 l -1155 -108 l 0 -108 l 0 0

2744
01:18:02,750 --> 01:18:29,650
Sparks will fly! Electric Shock Sumo!!

2745
01:18:06,420 --> 01:18:09,120
come to the front and compete in hand-pushing sumo

2746
01:18:07,780 --> 01:18:09,120
What?

2747
01:18:09,120 --> 01:18:12,720
But this isn't your regular hand-push sumo

2748
01:18:12,720 --> 01:18:20,100
The hand-push sumo will occur with an electric current to zap you!

2749
01:18:12,790 --> 01:18:20,940
All while electrical current runs through them

2750
01:18:12,790 --> 01:18:20,940
m 0 0 l -1155 0 l -1155 -108 l 0 -108 l 0 0

2751
01:18:18,840 --> 01:18:20,820
Why would we
do such a thing?

2752
01:18:20,100 --> 01:18:24,200
The first to fall off the platform loses

2753
01:18:21,100 --> 01:18:29,650
The last person to stay on the platform wins

2754
01:18:21,100 --> 01:18:29,650
m 0 0 l -1155 0 l -1155 -108 l 0 -108 l 0 0

2755
01:18:24,200 --> 01:18:29,080
For each win, I will administer a point to the team

2756
01:18:29,560 --> 01:18:33,800
First off from Team Miyasako: Nakaoka

2757
01:18:33,780 --> 01:18:43,860
Lotti Nakaoka

2758
01:18:33,780 --> 01:18:43,860
Team Miyasako

2759
01:18:34,700 --> 01:18:39,300
From Team Fujimoto it's Tanaka.

2760
01:18:37,290 --> 01:18:43,860
Tanaka Naoki

2761
01:18:37,290 --> 01:18:43,860
Team Fujimoto

2762
01:18:38,940 --> 01:18:40,360
Oh no!

2763
01:18:43,930 --> 01:18:44,260
Do your best in the battle of thin hair

2764
01:18:44,260 --> 01:18:47,100
Do your best in the battle of thin hair

2765
01:18:47,100 --> 01:18:47,690
That's actually true

2766
01:18:47,690 --> 01:18:49,730
Thin hair battle

2767
01:18:49,730 --> 01:18:51,100
How confident are you?

2768
01:18:50,100 --> 01:18:51,970
Thin hair battle

2769
01:18:54,230 --> 01:18:54,740
Thin hair battle!!

2770
01:18:54,740 --> 01:18:58,220
So loud

2771
01:18:56,920 --> 01:18:59,820
You don't have to say it over and over. We heard you

2772
01:18:59,240 --> 01:19:00,220
Repeat until someone laughs

2773
01:19:00,480 --> 01:19:01,200
Is this okay?

2774
01:19:01,200 --> 01:19:02,310
To start off

2775
01:19:02,310 --> 01:19:03,280
we will have the electric current run through you.

2776
01:19:02,520 --> 01:19:03,400
So scary.

2777
01:19:03,280 --> 01:19:07,220
we will have the electric current run through you.

2778
01:19:07,220 --> 01:19:08,980
Please wait

2779
01:19:08,980 --> 01:19:10,020
It's already sparking

2780
01:19:10,940 --> 01:19:12,040
You're just saying that

2781
01:19:12,060 --> 01:19:14,260
It's fine

2782
01:19:12,650 --> 01:19:14,260
Really!?

2783
01:19:13,060 --> 01:19:14,260
Yes, really!

2784
01:19:14,340 --> 01:19:16,720
For now, we're going to have you build up all the electricity!

2785
01:19:16,160 --> 01:19:18,660
Nakaoka, hands behind your back.

2786
01:19:18,620 --> 01:19:20,660
Hands behind you.

2787
01:19:20,930 --> 01:19:21,230
Holy smokes!! Your hair!!

2788
01:19:21,230 --> 01:19:24,700
Holy smokes!! Your hair!!

2789
01:19:23,520 --> 01:19:25,220
That's too scary!!

2790
01:19:26,760 --> 01:19:28,080
What's up with that?

2791
01:19:28,080 --> 01:19:29,940
Will we really be okay?

2792
01:19:29,170 --> 01:19:31,940
That's pretty extreme

2793
01:19:30,520 --> 01:19:31,970
This is too much

2794
01:19:31,970 --> 01:19:37,680
This is definitely dangerous!!

2795
01:19:32,200 --> 01:19:37,700
Let's begin. Electric Shock Sumo... Start!

2796
01:19:39,940 --> 01:19:41,940
I'm scared!!

2797
01:19:43,590 --> 01:19:44,550
Let's go!?

2798
01:19:44,550 --> 01:19:47,990
Ok?

2799
01:19:45,450 --> 01:19:47,990
Ok?

2800
01:19:46,250 --> 01:19:47,990
Ok?

2801
01:19:47,120 --> 01:19:47,990
Ok?

2802
01:19:47,990 --> 01:19:49,020
Let's get going already

2803
01:19:49,020 --> 01:19:50,230
Let's go

2804
01:19:50,230 --> 01:19:51,320
Ahhh, I'm scared!!

2805
01:19:50,660 --> 01:19:52,480
What should we do? Are we doing it?

2806
01:19:52,480 --> 01:19:54,080
Yes. Go ahead

2807
01:19:54,720 --> 01:19:56,520
Okay... Here I go...

2808
01:20:00,400 --> 01:20:03,540
This ain't even a proper battle

2809
01:20:04,310 --> 01:20:05,640
Both of them can't do it

2810
01:20:05,900 --> 01:20:07,940
Draw!!

2811
01:20:08,210 --> 01:20:10,250
I can't stand it!!

2812
01:20:09,260 --> 01:20:10,360
Can't do it

2813
01:20:11,580 --> 01:20:12,850
Since it's a draw

2814
01:20:12,850 --> 01:20:15,220
we have to change players

2815
01:20:15,380 --> 01:20:22,390
Miyasako Hiroyuki

2816
01:20:15,380 --> 01:20:22,390
Team Miyasako

2817
01:20:16,950 --> 01:20:22,390
Cunning Takeyama

2818
01:20:16,950 --> 01:20:22,390
Team Fujimoto

2819
01:20:18,760 --> 01:20:21,120
I can't do it.

2820
01:20:22,820 --> 01:20:24,760
Beginning to bald battle

2821
01:20:24,760 --> 01:20:25,760
Purification ceremony battle

2822
01:20:25,760 --> 01:20:26,900
Purification ceremony battle

2823
01:20:28,020 --> 01:20:29,670
I have no relation to purification ceremonies

2824
01:20:30,290 --> 01:20:32,530
You did one, once

2825
01:20:32,700 --> 01:20:34,770
Photo-taken-in-bed battle!!

2826
01:20:35,000 --> 01:20:35,670
That was so many years ago!! I finished it already!!

2827
01:20:35,670 --> 01:20:36,570
That was so many years ago!! I finished it already!!

2828
01:20:36,570 --> 01:20:37,310
The bed wasn't in the photo

2829
01:20:37,310 --> 01:20:40,210
No wait, I shouldn't say "the bed"

2830
01:20:39,820 --> 01:20:41,580
No, the bed was in the picture too!

2831
01:20:40,820 --> 01:20:41,580
It was!

2832
01:20:41,600 --> 01:20:42,780
The bed was in the photo

2833
01:20:42,780 --> 01:20:45,150
I'm the kind of guy to sleep alone

2834
01:20:45,380 --> 01:20:47,550
Takeyama is also the type to sleep alone

2835
01:20:46,420 --> 01:20:49,360
Seriously, wait a minute

2836
01:20:47,730 --> 01:20:49,360
I'm scared!!

2837
01:20:49,400 --> 01:20:52,080
Those who sleep alone in bed battle!!

2838
01:20:53,300 --> 01:20:55,060
What kind of battle is that?

2839
01:20:55,080 --> 01:20:56,720
If we are talking about sleepers then we all are

2840
01:20:56,720 --> 01:20:57,460
Get ready

2841
01:20:57,480 --> 01:20:59,860
Go Take-chan!!

2842
01:20:58,220 --> 01:20:59,860
Do your best, Miyasako!!

2843
01:20:59,020 --> 01:21:01,520
Okay, let's get the electric current going!

2844
01:21:00,440 --> 01:21:02,480
Will the glasses be fine?

2845
01:21:02,480 --> 01:21:04,480
It's fine

2846
01:21:04,920 --> 01:21:06,120
I can hear it sparking.

2847
01:21:05,480 --> 01:21:07,260
Let's start the hand-push sumo

2848
01:21:06,970 --> 01:21:08,470
Attention

2849
01:21:07,380 --> 01:21:09,680
Alright, the hand-push sumo...

2850
01:21:10,740 --> 01:21:12,070
Yes, loser!!

2851
01:21:16,810 --> 01:21:17,250
Yes, loser!!

2852
01:21:17,250 --> 01:21:18,910
Yes, loser!!

2853
01:21:20,940 --> 01:21:21,820
Miyasako loses!

2854
01:21:21,720 --> 01:21:23,820
I win! I win!

2855
01:21:21,810 --> 01:21:23,520
Miyasako loses!

2856
01:21:24,120 --> 01:21:25,260
Yes!

2857
01:21:25,260 --> 01:21:26,020
Wait wait, but...

2858
01:21:26,000 --> 01:21:27,620
The machine touched you I think?

2859
01:21:27,620 --> 01:21:29,720
Did it?

2860
01:21:28,520 --> 01:21:29,620
So what happens?

2861
01:21:29,720 --> 01:21:30,560
So that doesn't count, let's go again

2862
01:21:30,560 --> 01:21:32,660
So that doesn't count, let's go again

2863
01:21:31,570 --> 01:21:33,020
That's scary man

2864
01:21:35,370 --> 01:21:36,680
Did it touch me?

2865
01:21:36,680 --> 01:21:38,920
I don't know who you are, but I'll kill you

2866
01:21:40,520 --> 01:21:42,370
Don't kill him, don't kill him

2867
01:21:40,700 --> 01:21:41,900
You can't say that

2868
01:21:42,450 --> 01:21:45,320
You can't say that!

2869
01:21:45,420 --> 01:21:47,420
Don't you dare touch me with that!

2870
01:21:47,420 --> 01:21:49,720
Miyasako-san, make sure you don't move please

2871
01:21:48,720 --> 01:21:49,370
Okay

2872
01:21:49,370 --> 01:21:50,270
Okay, let's go!

2873
01:21:50,270 --> 01:21:52,370
It's right behind you now, Miyasako

2874
01:21:53,470 --> 01:21:55,170
It's directly behind you

2875
01:21:54,970 --> 01:21:58,120
Alright then, here we go, Electric Shock Sumo, start!

2876
01:22:01,410 --> 01:22:05,490
Don't, don't, please don't!

2877
01:22:03,010 --> 01:22:07,060
My body would struggle with this...

2878
01:22:07,750 --> 01:22:10,150
Takeyama, go!

2879
01:22:10,120 --> 01:22:12,120
Wait, wait, wait..

2880
01:22:12,120 --> 01:22:13,280
Go!

2881
01:22:15,090 --> 01:22:16,840
Oh god...

2882
01:22:17,520 --> 01:22:18,840
I don't know who won...

2883
01:22:19,200 --> 01:22:20,200
What the hell man...

2884
01:22:19,280 --> 01:22:21,190
DRAW!

2885
01:22:21,320 --> 01:22:23,190
Battle of the ladies!!

2886
01:22:23,190 --> 01:22:23,920
This'll be good

2887
01:22:23,920 --> 01:22:25,920
We're counting on you, Ami-chan!

2888
01:22:26,320 --> 01:22:28,020
You can do it, Karen-chan!

2889
01:22:28,520 --> 01:22:33,410
It's the battle of the ladies for the third round... Who will win...

2890
01:22:28,520 --> 01:22:33,720
Kikuchi Ami

2891
01:22:28,520 --> 01:22:33,720
Takizawa Karen

2892
01:22:28,520 --> 01:22:33,720
Team Fujimoto

2893
01:22:28,520 --> 01:22:33,720
Team Miyasako

2894
01:22:33,970 --> 01:22:34,310
Go for it!

2895
01:22:34,020 --> 01:22:36,220
This is so scary

2896
01:22:34,310 --> 01:22:36,310
Go for it!!

2897
01:22:38,040 --> 01:22:43,420
Karen!!

2898
01:22:39,270 --> 01:22:43,420
Stop saying it like Helen!!

2899
01:22:39,270 --> 01:22:43,420
T/N: Helen refers to Nishikawa Helen. Yelling, “Helen!!” is a common phrase for imitating Nishikawa Kiyoshi, which is Helen’s husband. Fujimoto said “Kareeen!” just like how Kiyoshi would yell, “Helen!”

2900
01:22:44,400 --> 01:22:45,990
Wait, wait, wait, wait

2901
01:22:46,210 --> 01:22:46,900
Start!

2902
01:22:46,900 --> 01:22:48,720
Wait, wait, please stop!

2903
01:22:51,540 --> 01:22:52,530
What should I do...

2904
01:22:52,530 --> 01:22:54,440
Go, go, go

2905
01:22:53,870 --> 01:22:54,210
I'm scared!

2906
01:22:54,210 --> 01:22:55,800
I'm scared!

2907
01:22:55,800 --> 01:22:57,800
I don't want to!

2908
01:22:56,210 --> 01:22:57,730
Come on, go for it!

2909
01:22:59,520 --> 01:22:59,950
Don't do it!!

2910
01:22:59,950 --> 01:23:00,430
Don't do it!!

2911
01:23:00,430 --> 01:23:01,600
Don't do it!!

2912
01:23:05,020 --> 01:23:06,020
That was normal

2913
01:23:07,520 --> 01:23:07,730
That was just regular hand push sumo!!

2914
01:23:07,730 --> 01:23:08,770
That was just regular hand push sumo!!

2915
01:23:08,870 --> 01:23:11,020
Karen, what happened?

2916
01:23:11,350 --> 01:23:11,560
I didn't feel anything...

2917
01:23:11,560 --> 01:23:13,350
I didn't feel anything...

2918
01:23:13,360 --> 01:23:14,790
You should have...

2919
01:23:14,790 --> 01:23:16,020
The electric current was pointed at her back, right?

2920
01:23:16,400 --> 01:23:17,950
Wait, isn't this like seriously bad?

2921
01:23:17,950 --> 01:23:19,600
Wait, isn't this like seriously bad?

2922
01:23:19,810 --> 01:23:20,520
There was like no sound

2923
01:23:20,520 --> 01:23:20,940
You faked it, huh?

2924
01:23:20,940 --> 01:23:22,520
You faked it, huh?

2925
01:23:22,720 --> 01:23:24,720
No, really! No, but really!

2926
01:23:25,020 --> 01:23:26,080
She says she didn't feel a thing, but the joke got better

2927
01:23:26,080 --> 01:23:27,420
She says she didn't feel a thing, but the joke got better

2928
01:23:27,520 --> 01:23:28,520
She didn't feel it

2929
01:23:28,670 --> 01:23:29,820
Her hair is still sticking up, so she hasn't discharged the electricity

2930
01:23:29,820 --> 01:23:31,820
Her hair is still sticking up, so she hasn't discharged the electricity

2931
01:23:33,000 --> 01:23:34,820
I'm serious, it may have not looked it but it all hit me at once...

2932
01:23:34,820 --> 01:23:36,800
Your nasty side has really come out here...

2933
01:23:36,800 --> 01:23:38,570
Team Fujimoto wins this round!

2934
01:23:38,570 --> 01:23:41,570
Team Fujimoto wins!

2935
01:23:40,120 --> 01:23:41,570
But seriously, it was so scary!!

2936
01:23:41,810 --> 01:23:46,970
Koji Maba

2937
01:23:41,810 --> 01:23:46,970
Shinohara Shinichi

2938
01:23:41,810 --> 01:23:46,970
Team Fujimoto

2939
01:23:41,810 --> 01:23:46,970
Team Miyasako

2940
01:23:42,720 --> 01:23:46,970
Last round is Koji Maba vs Shinohara Shinichi. What will happen?

2941
01:23:46,970 --> 01:23:49,970
Right then, if you would start with the electricity...

2942
01:23:49,970 --> 01:23:52,320
Battle of the cheekbones!

2943
01:23:52,520 --> 01:23:54,820
That's only Shinohara-san!

2944
01:23:55,420 --> 01:23:57,420
Right then, Electric Hand Sumo..

2945
01:23:57,420 --> 01:23:58,270
START

2946
01:23:58,270 --> 01:24:00,270
My back feels cold, my back feels cold

2947
01:24:00,720 --> 01:24:02,270
Seriously, it feels cold

2948
01:24:02,270 --> 01:24:04,270
Wait, wait, wait...

2949
01:24:04,480 --> 01:24:05,820
Ow damn it!

2950
01:24:05,820 --> 01:24:06,780
Ow!!

2951
01:24:06,780 --> 01:24:06,980
Ow!!

2952
01:24:06,980 --> 01:24:08,150
Ow!!

2953
01:24:08,150 --> 01:24:08,800
Watch

2954
01:24:10,020 --> 01:24:12,670
Ow, ow, ow

2955
01:24:12,820 --> 01:24:15,070
It touched my d***

2956
01:24:15,320 --> 01:24:16,820
He got him there!

2957
01:24:17,020 --> 01:24:18,430
What the hell

2958
01:24:18,430 --> 01:24:21,080
It really hurts...

2959
01:24:22,070 --> 01:24:23,220
Don't scratch it!!

2960
01:24:25,220 --> 01:24:26,820
Again!

2961
01:24:27,000 --> 01:24:27,770
Shinohara-san, stop being so scared

2962
01:24:27,770 --> 01:24:29,550
Shinohara-san, stop being so scared

2963
01:24:29,620 --> 01:24:30,820
I think it'd be funnier if they did a "battle of the d***s"

2964
01:24:30,820 --> 01:24:32,520
I think it'd be funnier if they did a "battle of the d***s"

2965
01:24:32,540 --> 01:24:33,610
It REALLY hurts, Matsumoto-san!!

2966
01:24:33,610 --> 01:24:36,120
It REALLY hurts, Matsumoto-san!!

2967
01:24:36,090 --> 01:24:39,320
But I'm sure it's good for your privates...

2968
01:24:39,070 --> 01:24:40,050
Oh man, it's coursing through me!

2969
01:24:40,050 --> 01:24:40,650
Nether Regions Shock Sumo start!

2970
01:24:40,650 --> 01:24:41,480
Nether Regions Shock Sumo start!

01:24:41,480 --> 01:24:42,420
Nether Regions Shock Sumo start!

2972
01:24:42,420 --> 01:24:43,470
Nether Regions Shock Sumo start!

2973
01:24:44,820 --> 01:24:45,690
Slowly, okay?

2974
01:24:45,690 --> 01:24:47,320
Slowly...

2975
01:24:46,390 --> 01:24:46,740
Okay

2976
01:24:55,420 --> 01:24:58,170
It REALLY hurts

2977
01:24:58,170 --> 01:24:59,270
It really hurts

2978
01:24:59,090 --> 01:25:01,550
Why'd you jump off?!

2979
01:25:01,600 --> 01:25:04,520
Stay on there!!

2980
01:25:03,520 --> 01:25:04,570
Winners, Team Miyasako!

2981
01:25:04,570 --> 01:25:08,090
Team Miyasako wins!

2982
01:25:08,110 --> 01:25:16,220
Team Fujimoto

2983
01:25:08,110 --> 01:25:16,220
Team Miyasako

2984
01:25:09,020 --> 01:25:16,220
After the first round, they're tied. Who will win?!

2985
01:25:16,940 --> 01:25:20,560
Sharpen your nerves! Pistol Bang Bang!

2986
01:25:20,560 --> 01:25:24,320
Bang Bang!

2987
01:25:20,560 --> 01:25:24,320
Pistol

2988
01:25:20,560 --> 01:25:24,320
Sharpen your nerves!

2989
01:25:23,020 --> 01:25:24,140
What the hell is this?

2990
01:25:24,390 --> 01:25:31,970
First, make your right hand into a pistol and with your left hand, touch your thumb and index fingers like a target

2991
01:25:24,710 --> 01:25:32,740
Have your right hand as a pistol,
your left hand as if it were your opponent

2992
01:25:24,710 --> 01:25:32,740
m 0 0 l -1155 0 l -1155 -108 l 0 -108 l 0 0

2993
01:25:24,710 --> 01:25:45,800
Sharpen your nerves! Pistol Bang Bang!!

2994
01:25:31,970 --> 01:25:37,790
When you hear the pistol's bang, switch your hand's poses

2995
01:25:32,740 --> 01:25:41,290
When you hear bang, you switch the actions on the hands

2996
01:25:32,790 --> 01:25:41,290
m 0 0 l -1155 0 l -1155 -108 l 0 -108 l 0 0

2997
01:25:37,790 --> 01:25:41,520
Please don't practice right now.

2998
01:25:41,290 --> 01:25:45,800
When you screw up the pose or
can't keep up with the rhythm, you're out

2999
01:25:41,370 --> 01:25:45,800
m 0 0 l -1155 0 l -1155 -108 l 0 -108 l 0 0

3000
01:25:41,520 --> 01:25:45,800
When you screw up or can't keep up with the rhythm, you are OUT

3001
01:25:45,840 --> 01:25:47,480
The winning team will receive a huge game-changing 300 points!

3002
01:25:47,480 --> 01:25:48,650
The winning team will receive a huge game-changing 300 points!

3003
01:25:48,650 --> 01:25:50,670
The winning team will receive a huge game-changing 300 points!

3004
01:25:52,280 --> 01:25:53,520
Game-changer!

3005
01:25:53,520 --> 01:25:56,440
URRRRRUUUUFFUIIII

3006
01:26:03,100 --> 01:26:03,600
Since you are being noisy, I'm taking away 400 points

3007
01:26:03,600 --> 01:26:05,420
Since you are being noisy, I'm taking away 400 points

3008
01:26:05,740 --> 01:26:07,560
Sweet!

3009
01:26:05,920 --> 01:26:11,720
Team Fujimoto -400 points

3010
01:26:07,560 --> 01:26:08,280
Do it again!

3011
01:26:08,280 --> 01:26:09,890
This is unbearable...

3012
01:26:10,010 --> 01:26:13,170
First, so you know what the rhythm will be like

3013
01:26:13,170 --> 01:26:16,330
Junior-san will do a demonstration

3014
01:26:16,330 --> 01:26:18,330
Please don't practice, just watch me.

3015
01:26:18,330 --> 01:26:19,860
Right then, please start!

3016
01:26:20,200 --> 01:26:21,000
Pay attention to the rhythm

3017
01:26:21,000 --> 01:26:21,520
Can he do it...?

3018
01:26:24,870 --> 01:26:27,150
It's easy!

3019
01:26:26,570 --> 01:26:27,340
We can do this

3020
01:26:27,340 --> 01:26:28,440
I think I could do this

3021
01:26:28,680 --> 01:26:29,420
It's so easy...

3022
01:26:29,420 --> 01:26:30,340
It's SO easy...

3023
01:26:30,340 --> 01:26:31,380
It really is...

3024
01:26:33,020 --> 01:26:33,700
Oh, it gets faster...

3025
01:26:41,570 --> 01:26:43,350
It might be easier when it's faster

3026
01:26:43,970 --> 01:26:49,410
First round is Miyasako vs Takizawa. Miyasako is up first.

3027
01:26:44,220 --> 01:26:49,860
1st round

3028
01:26:44,220 --> 01:26:49,860

3029
01:26:44,220 --> 01:26:49,860

Scary!!

3040
01:27:07,930 --> 01:27:08,750
Scary!!

3041
01:27:08,260 --> 01:27:08,750

3042
01:27:08,500 --> 01:27:08,750
Scary!!

3043
01:27:08,760 --> 01:27:10,180
Scary!!

3044
01:27:11,920 --> 01:27:13,850
When you hear bang, you switch them...

3045
01:27:14,360 --> 01:27:15,480
You're out...

3046
01:27:15,480 --> 01:27:17,410
Wait, this is scary, hold on a minute...

3047
01:27:16,530 --> 01:27:20,820
Hits: 0 times

3048
01:27:17,410 --> 01:27:18,400
You are OUT

3049
01:27:18,400 --> 01:27:20,340
That's terrifying!

3050
01:27:19,770 --> 01:27:21,100
Takizawa-san, you are up!

3051
01:27:21,890 --> 01:27:22,400
What is this?!

3052
01:27:23,920 --> 01:27:24,120
You're kidding, I totally thought I got it

3053
01:27:24,120 --> 01:27:27,070
You're kidding, I totally thought I got it

3054
01:27:27,070 --> 01:27:28,890
What can you actually do?..

3055
01:27:28,890 --> 01:27:29,380
I couldn't do it...

3056
01:27:29,420 --> 01:27:31,870
You are the youngest one here, okay?

3057
01:27:31,090 --> 01:27:31,460
Yup!

3058
01:27:32,130 --> 01:27:33,890
You're confident, huh?

3059
01:27:33,210 --> 01:27:33,560
Yup!

3060
01:27:33,900 --> 01:27:37,180
Well then, Pistol Bang Bang... Start!

3061
01:27:38,450 --> 01:27:39,180
You got this!

3062
01:27:39,610 --> 01:27:40,610
Don't think about anything

3063
01:27:42,070 --> 01:28:11,820
Hit Count

3064
01:27:43,740 --> 01:27:44,970
Her hands are weird...

3065
01:27:47,090 --> 01:27:47,540
Huh?

3066
01:27:47,840 --> 01:27:48,640
Good

3067
01:27:49,940 --> 01:27:50,620
That's good

3068
01:27:51,930 --> 01:27:53,160
We've already won

3069
01:27:53,840 --> 01:27:55,170
It's just about score now...

3070
01:27:55,800 --> 01:27:56,760
Point your finger at the target

3071
01:28:01,020 --> 01:28:02,120
Amazing

3072
01:28:11,760 --> 01:28:13,120

It was so easy...

3076
01:28:15,740 --> 01:28:18,240
Easy? It should be like this guys!

3077
01:28:18,450 --> 01:28:19,700
Thank you very much!

3078
01:28:19,490 --> 01:28:20,540

3082
01:28:29,760 --> 01:28:36,100

Second

3085
01:28:29,760 --> 01:28:36,100
The 54 year old Downtown battle. The deciding battle has been left to these two...

3086
01:28:29,760 --> 01:28:36,100
The final battle

3087
01:28:36,340 --> 01:28:36,920
You can do this, right?

3088
01:28:36,920 --> 01:28:37,360
Of course!

3089
01:28:37,360 --> 01:28:37,860
You can do it, right?

3090
01:28:37,860 --> 01:28:38,420
I can!

3091
01:28:38,420 --> 01:28:39,530
I definitely won't lose

3092
01:28:38,610 --> 01:28:39,690
Right then, let's go

3093
01:28:39,690 --> 01:28:41,320
What score are you aiming for?

3094
01:28:41,490 --> 01:28:43,620
10 times

3095
01:28:41,960 --> 01:28:44,220
He says he's going to get 10

3096
01:28:43,620 --> 01:28:46,120
There's no way I'm gonna lose

3097
01:28:44,320 --> 01:28:46,960
Hamada-san's Pistol Bang Bang... Start!

3098
01:28:47,860 --> 01:28:49,520
His face is so close to his hands...

3099
01:28:49,760 --> 01:28:51,000
That's the face of a loser...

3100
01:28:51,420 --> 01:28:58,020
Hit Count

3101
01:28:58,900 --> 01:29:00,670
So close...

3102
01:29:02,010 --> 01:29:03,340
So close...

3103
01:29:03,340 --> 01:29:04,310
The transmission between your brain and hands is so slow!

3104
01:29:04,310 --> 01:29:06,360
The transmission between your brain and hands is so slow!

3105
01:29:06,420 --> 01:29:09,320
Why don't you just do it a few times?

3106
01:29:07,360 --> 01:29:09,440
He looks a bit shocked...

3107
01:29:09,320 --> 01:29:11,740
Even if he screws up, just keep going...

3108
01:29:11,740 --> 01:29:13,410
In this situation...

3109
01:29:13,740 --> 01:29:15,180
Pistol Bang Bang, start!

3110
01:29:19,720 --> 01:29:51,220
Hit Count

3111
01:29:24,610 --> 01:29:24,900
Nope

3112
01:29:25,290 --> 01:29:26,900
That's enough

3113
01:29:26,880 --> 01:29:28,880
No no, he can still do it

3114
01:29:29,700 --> 01:29:30,600
It's fine!

3115
01:29:34,600 --> 01:29:35,600
You're doing great!

3116
01:29:36,180 --> 01:29:37,060
He did it!

3117
01:29:43,140 --> 01:29:44,420
You can do it!

3118
01:29:48,260 --> 01:29:51,180
THAT'S ENOUGH!

3119
01:29:54,160 --> 01:29:56,410
There's nothing I can do!!

3120
01:29:56,970 --> 01:29:59,220
Just show you can do it and let's end this!

3121
01:30:01,410 --> 01:30:02,060
Please do it for us!

3122
01:30:03,740 --> 01:30:05,720
It'd be better if he actually could do it and end this

3123
01:30:07,520 --> 01:30:08,440
Whew, that was funny

3124
01:30:08,440 --> 01:30:11,120
What are you aiming for, score wise?

3125
01:30:09,730 --> 01:30:11,520
I am aiming for like...

3126
01:30:11,520 --> 01:30:14,120
12 or 13 times, I think I can do that

3127
01:30:12,800 --> 01:30:14,240
You want to get into double digits for sure

3128
01:30:14,240 --> 01:30:18,120
Right then, Matsumoto-san's Pistol Bang Bang... Start

3129
01:30:19,520 --> 01:30:20,360
We're counting on you

3130
01:30:22,420 --> 01:30:30,520
Hit Count

3131
01:30:29,020 --> 01:30:30,080
What?!

3132
01:30:30,780 --> 01:30:31,920
See...

3133
01:30:31,920 --> 01:30:33,030
That's the worst so far

3134
01:30:33,030 --> 01:30:34,850
It's you at the fish market!

3135
01:30:33,030 --> 01:30:36,960
T/N: He's referring to how it looks like Matsumoto is bidding for tuna at the fish market

3136
01:30:34,870 --> 01:30:36,960
He's at the fish market!

3137
01:30:38,840 --> 01:30:40,260
Who's at the damn fish market!

3138
01:30:40,900 --> 01:30:42,670
He's bidding!

3139
01:30:43,290 --> 01:30:44,420
That's just weird...

3140
01:30:44,420 --> 01:30:45,700
The first bid...

3141
01:30:45,750 --> 01:30:46,780
Let's make him do it a few times

3142
01:30:46,780 --> 01:30:48,520
Let's make him do it a few times

3143
01:30:48,960 --> 01:30:50,210
Okay, let's do it again

3144
01:30:49,670 --> 01:30:52,520
That was the worst so far

3145
01:30:51,320 --> 01:30:52,520
Come on now...

3146
01:30:53,300 --> 01:30:55,720
Just let me carry on trying!!

3147
01:30:56,470 --> 01:30:58,820
Just let me carry on, okay?

3148
01:30:59,620 --> 01:31:01,740
He looks like he became a Visual Kei band member

3149
01:30:59,770 --> 01:31:02,520
T/N: Visual Kei refers to a Japanese music/fashion style that was popular in the 90s. Bands/artists like Dir En Gray, Malice Mizer, and Miyavi are some examples. Many photos feature Visual Kei artists with unusual hand gestures.

3150
01:31:01,780 --> 01:31:03,410
Right then, let's go

3151
01:31:02,130 --> 01:31:03,380
Just let me carry on

3152
01:31:03,380 --> 01:31:05,620
Pistol Bang Bang... Start!

3153
01:31:09,920 --> 01:31:39,120
Hit Count

3154
01:31:18,570 --> 01:31:19,570
What is this?

3155
01:31:21,070 --> 01:31:22,620
He can do it if it's on that side

3156
01:31:27,820 --> 01:31:28,940
He screwed up...

3157
01:31:30,820 --> 01:31:33,120
Your face... Come on

3158
01:31:33,120 --> 01:31:34,920
What are you even doing?

3159
01:31:39,260 --> 01:31:40,450
He's just  messing around!

3160
01:31:40,470 --> 01:31:43,990
He was totally messing around!

3161
01:31:41,800 --> 01:31:43,490
THE END!

3162
01:31:44,880 --> 01:31:46,210
And with that!

3163
01:31:46,440 --> 01:31:47,010
You're both old men!!

3164
01:31:47,010 --> 01:31:48,990
You're both old men!!

3165
01:31:55,030 --> 01:31:59,440
After over four hours of working

3166
01:31:55,160 --> 01:31:57,220
After four straight hours on the job

3167
01:31:57,800 --> 01:32:01,280
They finally have a moment to rest

3168
01:32:02,310 --> 01:32:04,550
I wonder, why do your eyebrows furrow when you're angry?

3169
01:32:04,550 --> 01:32:06,950
I wonder, why do your eyebrows furrow when you're angry?

3170
01:32:07,690 --> 01:32:09,150
You mean like this?

3171
01:32:08,540 --> 01:32:09,820
Exactly

3172
01:32:10,590 --> 01:32:13,020
When you see something bad or gross, that you hate

3173
01:32:13,020 --> 01:32:15,660
When you see something bad or gross, that you hate

3174
01:32:15,660 --> 01:32:18,190
Your body goes "Please no!" and tells your eyes to narrow

3175
01:32:18,190 --> 01:32:20,120
Your body goes "Please no!" and tells your eyes to narrow

3176
01:32:20,120 --> 01:32:22,020
Your body goes "Please no!" and tells your eyes to narrow

3177
01:32:22,100 --> 01:32:23,510
And because of that, it goes:

3178
01:32:26,620 --> 01:32:27,620
Like this...

3179
01:32:29,910 --> 01:32:31,180
What an idiot

3180
01:32:30,530 --> 01:32:32,970
Like this?

3181
01:32:34,550 --> 01:32:35,690
That face was great

3182
01:32:38,840 --> 01:32:40,040
"Like this?" he said...

3183
01:32:39,240 --> 01:32:41,920
I thought I did pretty well though...

3184
01:32:45,420 --> 01:32:46,880
That's not what I mean

3185
01:32:46,880 --> 01:32:48,120
When you're mad you wanna appear huge

3186
01:32:48,120 --> 01:32:50,620
When you're mad you wanna appear huge

3187
01:32:50,620 --> 01:32:53,090
So, look big and strong, you mean

3188
01:32:51,440 --> 01:32:53,980
When you have to look big, your entire body goes like:

3189
01:32:55,960 --> 01:32:57,760
To appear menacing right?

3190
01:32:57,850 --> 01:33:00,010
Like when a cat goes "HISS" at you

3191
01:33:00,610 --> 01:33:02,950
You know, like "HISSSSS"

3192
01:33:03,200 --> 01:33:04,670
Try doing it twice in a row

3193
01:33:09,300 --> 01:33:10,650
Why the hell?

3194
01:33:12,300 --> 01:33:13,760
Getting pretty weird

3195
01:33:13,080 --> 01:33:15,530
I don't even know why I asked that

3196
01:33:14,990 --> 01:33:16,450
This is weird

3197
01:33:16,130 --> 01:33:16,930
Right?

3198
01:33:18,950 --> 01:33:22,050
That was pretty funny

3199
01:33:21,090 --> 01:33:22,480
When you, uh

3200
01:33:22,550 --> 01:33:23,990
Only say it once, it's pretty lame, right?

3201
01:33:23,990 --> 01:33:25,250
Only say it once, it's pretty lame, right?

3202
01:33:25,420 --> 01:33:26,320
Even just once, what if you made a really menacing face?

3203
01:33:26,320 --> 01:33:27,660
Even just once, what if you made a really menacing face?

3204
01:33:27,660 --> 01:33:29,460
Even just once, what if you made a really menacing face?

3205
01:33:29,790 --> 01:33:32,960
Would that be funny?

3206
01:33:30,870 --> 01:33:32,550
Maybe? Please try it.

3207
01:33:33,490 --> 01:33:35,430
I still think one time isn't funny

3208
01:33:35,630 --> 01:33:36,430
Just try looking REALLY intimidating

3209
01:33:36,430 --> 01:33:38,570
Just try looking REALLY intimidating

3210
01:33:49,670 --> 01:33:51,160
Even from the side, it was hilarious

3211
01:33:51,410 --> 01:33:53,680
Even looking from the side it was hilarious

3212
01:33:51,940 --> 01:33:53,550
That face was amazing!

3213
01:33:53,470 --> 01:33:54,620
Awesome

3214
01:33:54,490 --> 01:33:55,840
That sure was intimidating

3215
01:33:55,820 --> 01:33:57,530
That was amazing

3216
01:33:56,440 --> 01:33:57,920
That felt intense

3217
01:33:57,020 --> 01:33:59,250
You could feel the menace right?

3218
01:33:58,040 --> 01:33:59,250
Awesome!

3219
01:33:58,310 --> 01:33:59,000
Yeah!

3220
01:33:59,360 --> 01:34:00,510
Scary good

3221
01:34:00,510 --> 01:34:01,500
Really?

3222
01:34:00,980 --> 01:34:01,860
Yeah

3223
01:34:01,760 --> 01:34:02,190
Felt to me like I have to keep out of your territory

3224
01:34:02,190 --> 01:34:05,190
Felt to me like I have to keep out of your territory

3225
01:34:05,410 --> 01:34:07,110
That got out of hand

3226
01:34:08,400 --> 01:34:11,500
Appearance OK

3227
01:34:08,400 --> 01:34:11,500
Derby!

3228
01:34:08,440 --> 01:34:11,460
Next up on the derby, this character!

3229
01:34:11,500 --> 01:34:12,970
Pear juice SPRAY! Thanks-nashii!!

3230
01:34:12,970 --> 01:34:16,400
Pear juice SPRAY! Thanks-nashii!!

3231
01:34:16,590 --> 01:34:20,410
Funassyi

Funassyi!

3234
01:34:18,970 --> 01:34:20,210
It wasn't over

3235
01:34:20,440 --> 01:34:29,080
Confidential

3236
01:34:20,440 --> 01:34:29,080
Confidential

3237
01:34:20,440 --> 01:34:29,080

For this character, we've called out three famous people!

3240

Who will agree to play this character!?

3241

Which one of them will agree to play as Funassyi?

3242
01:34:29,920 --> 01:34:31,500
First up

3243
01:34:31,590 --> 01:34:32,430
Welcome

3244
01:34:32,430 --> 01:34:34,430
Please have a seat

3245
01:34:35,190 --> 01:34:35,820
Who is it?

3246
01:34:37,650 --> 01:34:38,750
No way!

3247
01:34:38,840 --> 01:34:41,730
Saigo Teruhiko

3248
01:34:39,620 --> 01:34:41,020
Saigo Teruhiko!

3249
01:34:44,180 --> 01:34:49,870
He is also the father of Emiri Henmi

3250
01:34:44,180 --> 01:34:49,870
His singing career took off in 1964

3251
01:34:46,440 --> 01:34:49,190
A singer who debuted in 1964

3252
01:34:49,990 --> 01:34:57,350
Kazuo Funaki

3253
01:34:49,990 --> 01:34:57,350
Saigo Teruhiko

3254
01:34:49,990 --> 01:34:57,350
Yukio Hashi

3255
01:34:50,480 --> 01:34:54,060
These three men were called Gosanke!

3256
01:34:50,480 --> 01:34:57,350
T/N: "Gosanke" is a phrase used for 3 individuals who were cream of the crop for a particular talent or skill.

3257
01:34:50,940 --> 01:34:57,350
Gosanke, the famous original idols!

3258
01:34:54,060 --> 01:34:57,260
In their time they enjoyed immense popularity as idols!

3259
01:34:57,430 --> 01:35:01,950
Will this veteran singer with 53 years of experience accept? Negotiations open!

3260
01:34:57,890 --> 01:35:01,940
Watch, as we negotiate this role with a giant of the industry!

3261
01:35:01,320 --> 01:35:02,910
No way!

3262
01:35:01,950 --> 01:35:04,950
We're from the "Don't Laugh Series." Have you ever seen the show itself?

3263
01:35:04,950 --> 01:35:09,360
We're from the "Don't Laugh Series." Have you ever seen the show itself?

3264
01:35:06,870 --> 01:35:07,840
I have

3265
01:35:08,400 --> 01:35:09,550
I see, thank you.

3266
01:35:10,620 --> 01:35:13,630
So, let's talk about Funassyi

3267
01:35:13,740 --> 01:35:14,950
I don't know about this one...

3268
01:35:14,480 --> 01:35:15,560
Funassyi...

3269
01:35:15,570 --> 01:35:17,380
This is too much

3270
01:35:16,700 --> 01:35:17,630
What about it?

3271
01:35:18,100 --> 01:35:27,170
Would you be interested in dressing as Funassyi

3272
01:35:21,400 --> 01:35:23,870
and appearing in front of the cast?

3273
01:35:23,870 --> 01:35:27,170
and appearing in front of the cast?

3274
01:35:27,340 --> 01:35:31,650
Let's have him watch a video of Funassyi

3275
01:35:28,200 --> 01:35:31,380
For confirmation, we'll show him a video of Funassyi

3276
01:35:29,230 --> 01:35:30,950
There's no way

3277
01:35:30,510 --> 01:35:31,430
Agreed

3278
01:35:31,670 --> 01:35:33,470
It's not like him

3279
01:35:33,150 --> 01:35:36,050
HYA-HAA~!

3280
01:35:36,070 --> 01:35:38,890
FUNASSYIII~

3281
01:35:40,650 --> 01:35:42,690
Would I have to jump that high?

3282
01:35:42,690 --> 01:35:45,760
Based on what you saw, what do you think?

3283
01:35:45,760 --> 01:35:47,600
Honestly, I'm speechless

3284
01:35:48,700 --> 01:35:50,800
I can't imagine myself in that suit

3285
01:35:50,910 --> 01:35:54,600
Negotiations ended

3286
01:35:51,370 --> 01:35:52,480
Ah!

3287
01:35:51,430 --> 01:35:53,280
It's just a bit too much

3288
01:35:52,590 --> 01:35:54,020
I don't think he'll go for it

3289
01:35:53,080 --> 01:35:53,700
I see

3290
01:35:55,440 --> 01:35:57,810
Next, we talked with this person:

3291
01:35:57,940 --> 01:35:58,980
Good day

3292
01:35:59,010 --> 01:36:00,200
Please sit in the middle

3293
01:36:00,040 --> 01:36:00,480
Alright

3294
01:36:00,360 --> 01:36:00,860
Thank you

3295
01:36:00,940 --> 01:36:01,930
Thank you for coming

3296
01:36:01,820 --> 01:36:03,110
Thank you

3297
01:36:02,610 --> 01:36:04,560
A director...?

3298
01:36:03,780 --> 01:36:04,650
Thanks for coming in this morning

3299
01:36:04,710 --> 01:36:07,650
Director

3300
01:36:04,710 --> 01:36:07,650
Yamazaki Takashi

3301
01:36:05,330 --> 01:36:07,470
Next, the film director, Yamazaki Takashi

3302
01:36:08,210 --> 01:36:17,210
T/N: Cast - Masato Sakai, Mitsuki Takahata, etc. Director/Screenwriter/VFX - Yamazaki Takashi.
Original Work - Ryohei Saigan's "Destiny: The Tale of Kamakura" (Serialized in "Monthly Manga Town", published by Futabasha.)

3303
01:36:11,370 --> 01:36:14,680
His latest work is "Destiny: The Tale of Kamakura"

3304
01:36:14,680 --> 01:36:16,620
Which has been a big hit and is now showing in theaters!

3305
01:36:17,730 --> 01:36:18,530
HEY YOU!

3306
01:36:18,570 --> 01:36:29,770
Always: Sunset on Third Street

3307
01:36:18,570 --> 01:36:29,770
Japan Academy Prize for Director of the Year!

3308
01:36:19,240 --> 01:36:24,320
He was awarded the Japan Academy Prize for Director of the Year for directing Always: Sunset on Third Street

3309
01:36:26,110 --> 01:36:31,100
He's the man who will be managing the opening and closing ceremonies for the Tokyo Olympics and Paralympics

3310
01:36:29,890 --> 01:36:36,080
Negotiations with the world-famous director: begin!

3311
01:36:31,160 --> 01:36:35,210
We'll pose the same question to this director who will be representing Japan!

3312
01:36:36,080 --> 01:36:39,250
How much do you know about Downtown?

3313
01:36:39,250 --> 01:36:41,480
Well, Matsumoto has done some directing too

3314
01:36:41,480 --> 01:36:43,020
I get the impression that his works cut deep into many issues

3315
01:36:43,020 --> 01:36:45,350
I get the impression that his works cut deep into many issues

3316
01:36:45,990 --> 01:36:47,390
What about Hosei, Endo and Tanaka?

3317
01:36:47,390 --> 01:36:48,790
What about Hosei, Endo and Tanaka?

3318
01:36:48,790 --> 01:36:50,620
What about Hosei, Endo and Tanaka?

3319
01:36:50,860 --> 01:36:52,290
Tanaka is interesting, a good actor. His range as an actor is great

3320
01:36:52,290 --> 01:36:54,430
Tanaka is interesting, a good actor. His range as an actor is great

3321
01:36:54,430 --> 01:36:57,000
Tanaka is interesting, a good actor. His range as an actor is great

3322
01:36:54,510 --> 01:36:55,310
He's heard of you

3323
01:36:57,000 --> 01:36:59,100
He can play characters with split personalities really well

3324
01:36:59,100 --> 01:37:01,670
He can play characters with split personalities really well

3325
01:37:01,670 --> 01:37:04,070
What about Endo?

3326
01:37:07,870 --> 01:37:09,940
He's just some baseball fan I think

3327
01:37:13,870 --> 01:37:15,800
I'm not that shallow...

3328
01:37:15,680 --> 01:37:18,120
On top of that, all he could say is you're a fan

3329
01:37:17,070 --> 01:37:18,310
A baseball fan

3330
01:37:17,280 --> 01:37:18,450
If only he could've...

3331
01:37:19,640 --> 01:37:20,830
Nice hit!

3332
01:37:19,670 --> 01:37:22,410
Well, can't do much about it, let's just keep going

3333
01:37:22,340 --> 01:37:24,960
On to the main issue

3334
01:37:22,920 --> 01:37:24,350
Now, we'll ask the question

3335
01:37:24,960 --> 01:37:26,790
Here's what we got for you, Funassyi

3336
01:37:26,790 --> 01:37:27,730
Here's what we got for you, Funassyi

3337
01:37:28,000 --> 01:37:28,490
Huh? A full body suit?

3338
01:37:28,490 --> 01:37:30,060
Huh? A full body suit?

3339
01:37:30,060 --> 01:37:32,670
If you decide to accept, we'll change it a bit

3340
01:37:32,670 --> 01:37:34,270
If you decide to accept, we'll change it a bit

3341
01:37:34,270 --> 01:37:37,770
We'd want your face to show, so that the members can see you

3342
01:37:37,770 --> 01:37:41,680
We'd want your face to show, so that the members can see you

3343
01:37:40,130 --> 01:37:41,510
Really? That much?

3344
01:37:41,370 --> 01:37:42,930
They'll change it for him

3345
01:37:42,810 --> 01:37:45,880
It's just something to consider...

3346
01:37:45,960 --> 01:37:48,280
Negotiation ended

3347
01:37:49,360 --> 01:37:51,430
Next up, this person

3348
01:37:52,640 --> 01:37:53,490
Good morning!

3349
01:37:52,980 --> 01:37:54,570
Hello

3350
01:37:54,080 --> 01:37:55,060
Thank you for coming

3351
01:37:59,130 --> 01:38:02,130
Sanyuutei Enraku

3352
01:37:59,870 --> 01:38:01,550
Sanyuutei Enraku

3353
01:38:01,670 --> 01:38:03,010
You're joking...

3354
01:38:02,310 --> 01:38:08,340
T/N: Rakugo comedians take on the name of their mentor. Sanyutei Enraku the 6th was mentored by Sanyutei Enraku the 5th.

3355
01:38:02,310 --> 01:38:08,340
With the historical Rakugo surname,

3356
01:38:02,310 --> 01:38:08,340
he's inherited the name, Sanyutei Enraku the 6th

3357
01:38:03,310 --> 01:38:05,460
He has inherited the historical Rakugo name that's been passed down since the Edo period

3358
01:38:05,460 --> 01:38:08,160
who is now known as Sanyutei Enraku the 6th!

3359
01:38:08,330 --> 01:38:11,040
Shoten

3360
01:38:08,330 --> 01:38:11,040
Tachibana Sakon

3361
01:38:08,520 --> 01:38:16,180
He's appeared in the famous Shoten for 40 years!

3362
01:38:09,540 --> 01:38:12,380
One of the longest running variety TV series in Nihon TV's history

3363
01:38:12,380 --> 01:38:15,320
And he's performed on it for 40 years!

3364
01:38:16,380 --> 01:38:20,920
Negotiations with the leader of Rakugo: begin!

3365
01:38:17,140 --> 01:38:20,300
We'll now negotiate with the Tokyo leader of Rakugo!

3366
01:38:20,920 --> 01:38:25,250
What kind of image do you have of Downtown?

3367
01:38:24,040 --> 01:38:25,210
Well...

3368
01:38:25,250 --> 01:38:27,950
Comedians have a front for the public and a back of their real selves.

3369
01:38:27,950 --> 01:38:32,120
Comedians have a front for the public and a back of their real selves.

3370
01:38:29,660 --> 01:38:32,130
Downtown has a respectable back side

3371
01:38:32,130 --> 01:38:40,400
Hamada might appear rude on the surface,

3372
01:38:36,400 --> 01:38:38,500
but behind that facade, he's a good guy who is supportive

3373
01:38:38,500 --> 01:38:40,400
but behind that facade, he's a good guy who is supportive

3374
01:38:40,400 --> 01:38:45,170
He's a good role model,

3375
01:38:42,540 --> 01:38:45,170
and I've liked Downtown since they debuted

3376
01:38:45,170 --> 01:38:47,410
What about Cocorico?

3377
01:38:47,410 --> 01:38:53,240
They're just bugs profiting off Downtown.

3378
01:38:49,980 --> 01:38:51,410
They haven't tried hard alone, though I'd like to see that happen

3379
01:38:51,410 --> 01:38:53,250
They haven't tried hard alone, though I'd like to see that happen

3380
01:38:52,920 --> 01:38:54,620
What the hell

3381
01:38:54,020 --> 01:38:55,490
He's saying whatever he wants

3382
01:38:57,260 --> 01:38:58,100
Wait...

3383
01:38:57,980 --> 01:38:58,860
He's blunt

3384
01:38:58,250 --> 01:38:59,300
That was sudden

3385
01:38:59,320 --> 01:39:02,690
That was so unexpected!!

3386
01:39:01,680 --> 01:39:02,910
This was a bit much

3387
01:39:02,920 --> 01:39:03,790
Frightening...

3388
01:39:05,990 --> 01:39:09,330
He just said that out of the blue

3389
01:39:07,000 --> 01:39:08,950
I'm a bit scared

3390
01:39:08,340 --> 01:39:09,430
Yeah

3391
01:39:09,440 --> 01:39:10,530
Also, somewhat related

3392
01:39:10,530 --> 01:39:12,870
You know Hosei's way of making a name for himself?

3393
01:39:12,870 --> 01:39:15,340
The way he just sprinted towards Rakugo, I can respect that

3394
01:39:15,340 --> 01:39:16,870
The way he just sprinted towards Rakugo, I can respect that

3395
01:39:16,870 --> 01:39:19,770
We performed together, and I listened in on his show

3396
01:39:19,770 --> 01:39:21,240
We performed together, and I listened in on his show

3397
01:39:21,380 --> 01:39:23,960
You could really tell that he knows himself and loves the art

3398
01:39:22,160 --> 01:39:27,750
His love for Rakugo shows and it is a part of his act

3399
01:39:23,960 --> 01:39:26,760
and he truly embodies every story he tells

3400
01:39:27,750 --> 01:39:29,010
This is ridiculous

3401
01:39:27,750 --> 01:39:29,780
People who watch TV might not be familiar

3402
01:39:29,780 --> 01:39:34,550
People who watch TV might not be familiar

3403
01:39:31,350 --> 01:39:33,090
with his stage act, but he really is good

3404
01:39:33,090 --> 01:39:34,560
with his stage act, but he really is good

3405
01:39:37,910 --> 01:39:40,590
On to the main issue

3406
01:39:38,460 --> 01:39:39,850
Now we pose the question

3407
01:39:39,320 --> 01:39:40,880
He just laughed, didn't he?

3408
01:39:41,040 --> 01:39:43,280
So, concerning this character

3409
01:39:42,860 --> 01:39:45,270
Hayashiya Taihei

3410
01:39:42,860 --> 01:39:45,270
Looks like Taihei

3411
01:39:42,860 --> 01:39:45,270
T/N: Hayashiya Taihei is another Rakugo comedian.

3412
01:39:45,270 --> 01:39:47,000
Would you dress as Funassyi and appear on the show?

3413
01:39:47,000 --> 01:39:49,270
Would you dress as Funassyi and appear on the show?

3414
01:39:49,500 --> 01:39:50,470
Funassyi~! Eh?

3415
01:39:50,470 --> 01:39:52,270
Funassyi~! Eh?

3416
01:39:52,270 --> 01:39:56,080
Would they laugh if I did this?

3417
01:39:54,240 --> 01:39:56,400
I think there's no doubting that

3418
01:39:56,790 --> 01:39:57,960
I believe so

3419
01:39:58,310 --> 01:39:59,340
If I'm doing it we'll do it right.

3420
01:39:59,340 --> 01:40:01,810
If I'm doing it we'll do it right.

3421
01:40:01,930 --> 01:40:05,550
Negotiation ended

3422
01:40:03,270 --> 01:40:04,310
Thank you

3423
01:40:03,910 --> 01:40:07,030
I'm not sure here

3424
01:40:04,660 --> 01:40:05,960
No clue

3425
01:40:05,900 --> 01:40:11,160
Who will dress up as Funassyi

3426
01:40:05,900 --> 01:40:11,160
and appear on the show?!

3427
01:40:06,680 --> 01:40:10,630
Who among these could have accepted the offer?

3428
01:40:06,700 --> 01:40:07,590
Same

3429
01:40:11,980 --> 01:40:16,730
Who will dress up as Funassyi

3430
01:40:11,980 --> 01:40:16,730
and appear on the show?!

3431
01:40:12,820 --> 01:40:16,630
Who among these could have accepted the offer?

3432
01:40:16,750 --> 01:40:19,700
Hosei, your turn to answer!

3433
01:40:17,020 --> 01:40:19,090
Hosei, please answer the question!

3434
01:40:19,740 --> 01:40:20,870
This is hard

3435
01:40:20,870 --> 01:40:22,670
The one most against it was Saigo, right?

3436
01:40:22,670 --> 01:40:23,800
The one most against it was Saigo, right?

3437
01:40:23,890 --> 01:40:27,230
You think he'd do it?

3438
01:40:26,170 --> 01:40:28,240
Then, it's Saigo!!

3439
01:40:27,360 --> 01:40:28,710
You think?

3440
01:40:29,740 --> 01:40:35,480
And the answer is:

3441
01:40:35,980 --> 01:40:38,350
Kya-hoo~!!

3442
01:40:37,280 --> 01:40:40,890
Funassyi

3443
01:40:37,280 --> 01:40:40,890
Saigo Teruhiko

3444
01:40:38,350 --> 01:40:38,820
Teruhiko-nashii

3445
01:40:38,820 --> 01:40:42,760
Teruhiko-nashii

3446
01:40:41,390 --> 01:40:42,920
You got it!

3447
01:40:42,630 --> 01:40:43,840
Cool!

3448
01:40:43,940 --> 01:40:45,420
Wow

3449
01:40:45,420 --> 01:40:46,890
I decided to appear on the No Laughing show-nashii~!!

3450
01:40:45,420 --> 01:40:50,900
T/N: Funassyi's name is based on the word "nashi" which means pear. To sound more cute, Funassyi ends their sentence with "nasshi".

3451
01:40:46,890 --> 01:40:47,860
I decided to appear on the No Laughing show-nashii~!!

3452
01:40:47,860 --> 01:40:50,900
I decided to appear on the No Laughing show-nashii~!!

3453
01:40:50,900 --> 01:40:54,170
He's completely different from before

3454
01:40:52,660 --> 01:40:54,430
This isn't like him

3455
01:40:54,730 --> 01:40:57,970
What the hell are you making him do?

3456
01:40:56,600 --> 01:40:57,830
This is too much

3457
01:40:57,180 --> 01:40:58,650
Yeah, really

3458
01:40:58,170 --> 01:41:06,950
Kazuo Funaki

3459
01:40:58,270 --> 01:40:59,210
Neither Funaki

3460
01:40:59,610 --> 01:41:06,950
Yukio Hashi

3461
01:40:59,750 --> 01:41:00,600
or Hashi

3462
01:41:00,940 --> 01:41:02,640
Those two wouldn't ever get this job-nashii~!!

3463
01:41:02,640 --> 01:41:06,950
those two wouldn't ever get this job-nashii~!!

3464
01:41:07,680 --> 01:41:09,380
Alright everyone, do your best-nashii~!!

3465
01:41:08,860 --> 01:41:11,540
Wow

3466
01:41:09,380 --> 01:41:09,920
Alright everyone, do your best-nashii~!!

3467
01:41:09,920 --> 01:41:11,850
Alright everyone, do your best-nashii~!!

3468
01:41:11,570 --> 01:41:12,540
Awesome

3469
01:41:11,850 --> 01:41:14,190
Kya-hooo~!!

3470
01:41:15,180 --> 01:41:17,180
Did not expect that!

3471
01:41:16,520 --> 01:41:17,760
Why though

3472
01:41:19,080 --> 01:41:19,910
That was impressive huh?

3473
01:41:20,690 --> 01:41:22,770
He really did it

3474
01:41:22,340 --> 01:41:24,460
Seriously amazing

3475
01:41:22,400 --> 01:41:23,480
That's true

3476
01:41:28,270 --> 01:41:28,900
I was sure that Enraku would do it

3477
01:41:28,900 --> 01:41:30,740
I was sure that Enraku would do it

3478
01:41:30,410 --> 01:41:33,280
But I thought, "Nah, can't be"

3479
01:41:31,120 --> 01:41:32,090
Yeah, I see

3480
01:41:33,320 --> 01:41:36,700
He (Saigo) didn't look interested in the interview

3481
01:41:36,360 --> 01:41:37,560
You're right

3482
01:41:36,580 --> 01:41:37,930
A real plot twist

3483
01:41:37,240 --> 01:41:38,380
Completely different

3484
01:41:37,330 --> 01:41:39,630
He seemed against it

3485
01:41:39,880 --> 01:41:41,950
That was something else

3486
01:41:40,600 --> 01:41:42,010
Yeah

3487
01:41:46,130 --> 01:41:47,160
How y'all doing?

3488
01:41:47,850 --> 01:41:49,120
Last year, in Japan

3489
01:41:49,120 --> 01:41:49,890
Many heinous crimes became widespread!!

3490
01:41:49,890 --> 01:41:51,790
Many heinous crimes became widespread!!

3491
01:41:52,430 --> 01:41:53,890
Widespread?

3492
01:41:53,890 --> 01:41:58,030
We'll be doing a

3493
01:41:55,920 --> 01:41:58,030
special training that the Omame Police takes pride in...

3494
01:41:58,780 --> 01:42:00,680
Let's all go right now

3495
01:42:01,730 --> 01:42:02,960
Special training...

3496
01:42:02,310 --> 01:42:09,400
The police station will join in the special training

3497
01:42:02,310 --> 01:42:09,400
To prepare for the surge in crime

3498
01:42:07,550 --> 01:42:09,400
What "special training"?

3499
01:42:10,860 --> 01:42:12,530
Could you please board the bus?

3500
01:42:12,530 --> 01:42:13,650
Yes

3501
01:42:14,020 --> 01:42:20,580
Board the bus to the training grounds

3502
01:42:14,020 --> 01:42:20,580
What could be waiting for them ahead?!

3503
01:42:14,520 --> 01:42:18,480
They board the bus to the training grounds

3504
01:42:18,480 --> 01:42:20,580
What could be waiting for them?!

3505
01:42:25,570 --> 01:42:34,130
A new battle for the 5 members will begin!!

3506
01:42:27,270 --> 01:42:29,310
For the 5 of them

3507
01:42:29,310 --> 01:42:33,210
A new battle will begin

3508
01:42:35,130 --> 01:42:39,650
The next stage: The Hostage Rescue Training Center

3509
01:42:39,650 --> 01:42:40,520
Here,

3510
01:42:40,670 --> 01:42:46,440
The battle with the new assassins begins

3511
01:42:40,880 --> 01:42:45,760
The fierce battle with assassins yet to be encountered will begin

3512
01:42:46,980 --> 01:42:48,190
Knew it

3513
01:42:46,980 --> 01:42:51,710
Training Grounds:
Special Equipments Room

3514
01:42:48,190 --> 01:42:49,470
This...

3515
01:42:49,470 --> 01:42:51,350
Here it comes

3516
01:42:51,350 --> 01:42:52,710
Knew it'd be this

3517
01:42:51,750 --> 01:42:53,880
The annual custom...

3518
01:42:55,120 --> 01:42:57,080
It's here again

3519
01:42:57,080 --> 01:42:59,490
Everyone please get changed

3520
01:42:59,490 --> 01:43:01,530
Hostage Rescue Training Center...

3521
01:43:03,200 --> 01:43:05,680
They change into easy-to-move attire

3522
01:43:03,200 --> 01:43:09,730
Before the hostage rescue training

3523
01:43:03,200 --> 01:43:09,730
They change into easy-to-move attire

3524
01:43:05,680 --> 01:43:08,710
And move on to the hostage rescue training

3525
01:43:09,730 --> 01:43:11,360
Let's go

3526
01:43:12,530 --> 01:43:14,370
There it is!!

3527
01:43:14,670 --> 01:43:17,710
Training Grounds

3528
01:43:14,880 --> 01:43:16,320
Here it is

3529
01:43:17,710 --> 01:43:19,570
There it is

3530
01:43:20,580 --> 01:43:22,480
From now, it's okay to laugh, but

3531
01:43:22,480 --> 01:43:23,280
The enemy, the black Oni, at the moment they catch you

3532
01:43:23,280 --> 01:43:24,980
The enemy, the black Oni, at the moment they catch you

3533
01:43:24,980 --> 01:43:27,380
You'll receive a harsh punishment on the spot

3534
01:43:27,070 --> 01:43:27,520
Yes...

3535
01:43:27,520 --> 01:43:28,420
Yeah

3536
01:43:28,420 --> 01:43:30,590
If it's only you guys

3537
01:43:30,590 --> 01:43:32,150
The smell of stinky comedians will surround the area

3538
01:43:32,150 --> 01:43:33,290
The smell of stinky comedians will surround the area

3539
01:43:33,720 --> 01:43:35,560
Here's a moderately popular actor

3540
01:43:35,560 --> 01:43:37,120
Here's a moderately popular actor

3541
01:43:36,470 --> 01:43:37,030
Moderately...

3542
01:43:37,030 --> 01:43:37,840
Moderately??

3543
01:43:38,030 --> 01:43:40,090
Moderately popular

3544
01:43:39,090 --> 01:43:40,090
Meaning a little, right?

3545
01:43:40,090 --> 01:43:42,230
I wonder if this description is right

3546
01:43:41,810 --> 01:43:42,230
Ready?

3547
01:43:42,230 --> 01:43:43,460
It's this person!!

3548
01:43:46,980 --> 01:43:48,640
He's really flying

3549
01:43:48,640 --> 01:43:50,340
It's Muro!!

3550
01:43:49,280 --> 01:43:50,340
Whoa

3551
01:43:50,530 --> 01:43:51,670
You flew pretty high

3552
01:43:51,670 --> 01:43:53,270
Flew really high

3553
01:43:53,270 --> 01:43:56,440
Muro Tsuyoshi

3554
01:43:53,270 --> 01:43:56,440
Supporter

3555
01:43:53,270 --> 01:43:56,440
T/N: Muro Tsuyoshi is an actor who won the 2018 Elan d'Or Awards for Newcomer of the Year. He's acted in Yuusha Yoshihiko, Destiny: Tale of Kamakura, Gintama: Live Action, and many other shows/films.

3556
01:43:54,950 --> 01:43:55,860
I flew!

3557
01:43:56,440 --> 01:43:57,680
Are your feet okay?

3558
01:43:57,680 --> 01:43:59,610
I'm perfectly okay!!

3559
01:43:59,610 --> 01:44:00,900
Here he is!

3560
01:44:00,240 --> 01:44:00,900
I sort of...

3561
01:44:01,120 --> 01:44:01,880
I flew much higher than I expected...

3562
01:44:01,880 --> 01:44:03,250
I flew much higher than I expected...

3563
01:44:03,250 --> 01:44:05,020
You were surprised, weren't you?

3564
01:44:04,180 --> 01:44:05,020
Yes, I was surprised

3565
01:44:05,020 --> 01:44:07,990
He called you a "moderately popular actor"

3566
01:44:06,850 --> 01:44:07,990
Moderately popular, yes

3567
01:44:07,990 --> 01:44:08,890
In 2018, I will be a new and improved actor

3568
01:44:08,890 --> 01:44:11,090
In 2018, I will be a new and improved actor

3569
01:44:12,630 --> 01:44:18,700
A unique actor

3570
01:44:12,630 --> 01:44:18,700
Muro Tsuyoshi will go to battle!!

3571
01:44:18,700 --> 01:44:20,770
Amongst you guys, 1 person

3572
01:44:20,770 --> 01:44:22,580
Will go in that transparent room

3573
01:44:22,580 --> 01:44:24,490
And be locked up in the hostage room

3574
01:44:22,580 --> 01:44:26,100
Among the six, one person will be locked up in the hostage room

3575
01:44:22,580 --> 01:44:28,880
Hostage Rescue Training

3576
01:44:24,490 --> 01:44:28,280
The other 5 will go search for the key that will unlock the door

3577
01:44:25,900 --> 01:44:28,880
In order to rescue the hostage, the rest will go search for the key

3578
01:44:28,880 --> 01:44:31,450
This time, there is only 1 key

3579
01:44:31,450 --> 01:44:32,410
Meaning that if you find a key, that is the one true key

3580
01:44:32,120 --> 01:44:33,940
That's right, you just need 1 key

3581
01:44:32,410 --> 01:44:34,480
Meaning that if you find a key, that is the one true key

3582
01:44:34,980 --> 01:44:37,490
So, there won't be any fake keys

3583
01:44:36,680 --> 01:44:38,470
Yes, there used to be so many

3584
01:44:38,790 --> 01:44:40,820
This time, the hostage will be you, Matsumoto!!

3585
01:44:40,820 --> 01:44:42,090
This time, the hostage will be you, Matsumoto!!

3586
01:44:42,090 --> 01:44:43,090
This time, the hostage will be you, Matsumoto!!

3587
01:44:43,090 --> 01:44:46,110
Thank you very much!!

3588
01:44:46,520 --> 01:44:47,280
It's Matsumoto

3589
01:44:48,100 --> 01:44:50,630
We already knew that!!

3590
01:44:49,620 --> 01:44:50,740
Thank you!!

3591
01:44:50,630 --> 01:44:54,170
Every single year, I'm so jealous

3592
01:44:53,540 --> 01:44:54,720
It really is every single year!

3593
01:44:55,300 --> 01:44:58,680
However this time, in the hostage room at 10 minute intervals,

3594
01:44:55,990 --> 01:45:00,470
For Matsumoto, there will be a punishment every 10 minutes

3595
01:44:58,680 --> 01:45:00,220
There will be a punishment prepared

3596
01:45:00,470 --> 01:45:02,640
You don't need that many punishments, do you?

3597
01:45:02,060 --> 01:45:03,120
So, you should quickly...

3598
01:45:02,640 --> 01:45:04,890
I don't even know the meaning of these punishments

3599
01:45:05,250 --> 01:45:09,140
Simultaneously with the start, multiple Oni will appear

3600
01:45:05,250 --> 01:45:09,140
The Oni will appear at the same time as the start of the training

3601
01:45:09,780 --> 01:45:13,490
As time progresses, the Oni will increase

3602
01:45:09,780 --> 01:45:13,490
As time progresses, the Oni will increase

3603
01:45:13,900 --> 01:45:19,490
As they run away, they will search for the key

3604
01:45:14,400 --> 01:45:19,490
As they run from the Oni, they will search for the key to the locked room

3605
01:45:20,660 --> 01:45:26,210
No Getting Caught: American Police!

3606
01:45:26,530 --> 01:45:28,400
Is everyone ready then?

3607
01:45:28,400 --> 01:45:29,410
Aw geez...

3608
01:45:29,970 --> 01:45:31,240
This is so scary!!

3609
01:45:31,240 --> 01:45:33,230
Hostage rescue training...

3610
01:45:33,230 --> 01:45:34,290
Start!

3611
01:45:34,390 --> 01:45:37,990
Training Start

3612
01:45:36,600 --> 01:45:38,210
Here they come

3613
01:45:38,210 --> 01:45:39,140
Wow

3614
01:45:38,290 --> 01:46:19,750
Slipper

3615
01:45:40,210 --> 01:45:40,610
Please stop

3616
01:45:40,610 --> 01:45:41,580
Please stop

3617
01:45:41,580 --> 01:45:42,250
This is incredibly

3618
01:45:42,250 --> 01:45:43,980
This is incredibly painful, okay?

3619
01:45:43,980 --> 01:45:45,260
No thank you!

3620
01:45:47,390 --> 01:45:47,590
No

3621
01:45:47,590 --> 01:45:47,760
No

3622
01:45:47,760 --> 01:45:47,920
No

3623
01:45:47,920 --> 01:45:48,090
No

3624
01:45:48,090 --> 01:45:49,150
No

3625
01:45:49,350 --> 01:45:53,990
Locked on to Muro

3626
01:45:50,740 --> 01:45:54,000
Just a little more!

3627
01:45:53,290 --> 01:45:54,000
This hurts!

3628
01:45:53,990 --> 01:45:56,100
Just hurry up and get Muro!!

3629
01:45:56,100 --> 01:45:57,000
Just go and get Muro!!

3630
01:45:57,000 --> 01:45:57,900
Just go and get Muro!!

3631
01:45:57,900 --> 01:45:58,770
Why?

3632
01:45:58,770 --> 01:45:59,400
Why?

3633
01:45:59,400 --> 01:46:00,400
Too scary!

3634
01:46:00,400 --> 01:46:00,800
Hamada-san

3635
01:46:00,800 --> 01:46:02,640
Hamada-san

3636
01:46:02,640 --> 01:46:04,890
Aren't you a bit too close?

3637
01:46:04,890 --> 01:46:06,420
This is my first time

3638
01:46:06,420 --> 01:46:07,920
Wait, hold on...

3639
01:46:06,670 --> 01:46:08,580
Suddenly got caught!!

3640
01:46:07,920 --> 01:46:08,580
Go easy on me!

3641
01:46:08,270 --> 01:46:08,580
Muro-kun!

3642
01:46:08,580 --> 01:46:09,890
Have mercy on me

3643
01:46:08,580 --> 01:46:09,890
This is gonna hurt...

3644
01:46:09,890 --> 01:46:10,610
It hurts!

3645
01:46:09,890 --> 01:46:11,070
Have mercy, have mercy...

3646
01:46:11,970 --> 01:46:13,310
It really hurts

3647
01:46:14,180 --> 01:46:15,370
That's gotta be painful

3648
01:46:15,370 --> 01:46:17,350
So painful

3649
01:46:17,350 --> 01:46:18,570
That's a lot of pain

3650
01:46:18,570 --> 01:46:19,760
So so painful

3651
01:46:20,500 --> 01:46:22,490
Fu ha ha ha

3652
01:46:22,840 --> 01:46:28,000
This year,
Matsumoto is
aloof again

3653
01:46:25,150 --> 01:46:27,460
No, really, it's REALLY hot in there

3654
01:46:27,460 --> 01:46:28,030
I see

3655
01:46:28,030 --> 01:46:28,600
Yeah

3656
01:46:28,300 --> 01:46:30,260
Just now, that's really gotta hurt

3657
01:46:29,630 --> 01:46:30,860
That had to be painful

3658
01:46:31,070 --> 01:46:33,040
He went for my ear, the number one thing you shouldn't hit!!

3659
01:46:32,530 --> 01:46:33,630
Seriously?

3660
01:46:33,040 --> 01:46:33,230
Ah

3661
01:46:33,230 --> 01:46:33,330
Ah ha

3662
01:46:33,330 --> 01:46:33,430
Ah ha ha

3663
01:46:33,430 --> 01:46:34,870
Ah ha ha ha

3664
01:46:33,630 --> 01:46:35,240
That really hurt, didn't it?

3665
01:46:35,240 --> 01:46:39,810
Hamada can't
stop laughing

3666
01:46:36,880 --> 01:46:39,810
He gripped... He gripped the slipper and...

3667
01:46:38,920 --> 01:46:39,810
Right?

3668
01:46:39,940 --> 01:46:41,340
Ahh, that was funny

3669
01:46:41,340 --> 01:46:41,680
So funny

3670
01:46:41,680 --> 01:46:43,980
So funny

3671
01:46:42,750 --> 01:46:43,980
Oh, here here here

3672
01:46:44,150 --> 01:46:47,580
The arrival of the second Oni

3673
01:46:44,910 --> 01:46:46,480
Oh no, it's the harisen!!

3674
01:46:44,910 --> 01:46:47,580
T/N: Harisen is a large paper fan, often used in Japanese comedies

3675
01:46:46,480 --> 01:46:47,580
That one hurts a lot!

3676
01:46:47,920 --> 01:46:48,950
Ouch... They were right

3677
01:46:47,950 --> 01:46:49,970
So painful

3678
01:46:47,950 --> 01:47:16,380
Harisen

3679
01:46:48,950 --> 01:46:49,980
Ouch... They were right

3680
01:46:49,980 --> 01:46:51,850
This is really for real!

3681
01:46:50,830 --> 01:46:51,850
Oh no no no

3682
01:46:52,440 --> 01:46:53,380
Wait, please, no

3683
01:46:53,380 --> 01:46:54,860
This is really painful

3684
01:46:53,810 --> 01:46:55,970
Just wait, wait, hold on

3685
01:46:54,860 --> 01:46:56,580
Please... No... I'm still in pain

3686
01:46:56,580 --> 01:46:57,440
Don't trip!

3687
01:46:57,440 --> 01:46:59,530
Wait, please!!

3688
01:46:58,000 --> 01:46:59,530
Watch your feet!

3689
01:47:01,650 --> 01:47:02,410
Ow...

3690
01:47:03,030 --> 01:47:04,530
This is the worst!!

3691
01:47:04,730 --> 01:47:05,400
The harisen

3692
01:47:05,400 --> 01:47:05,830
The harisen and slippers

3693
01:47:05,830 --> 01:47:07,270
The harisen and slippers are horrible

3694
01:47:06,080 --> 01:47:07,270
Every year, they're so destructive

3695
01:47:07,520 --> 01:47:07,920
So scary

3696
01:47:12,190 --> 01:47:16,380
Ah...

3697
01:47:12,890 --> 01:47:16,380
That hurts...

3698
01:47:16,440 --> 01:47:18,410
This is too ridiculous

3699
01:47:18,340 --> 01:47:20,090
Slippers and harisen are horrible

3700
01:47:20,090 --> 01:47:21,750
This REALLY hurts...

3701
01:47:21,350 --> 01:47:22,250
Every year, we always get wrecked

3702
01:47:22,250 --> 01:47:24,650
Every year, we always get wrecked

3703
01:47:23,020 --> 01:47:24,650
Oh my god... It hurts so bad...

3704
01:47:23,310 --> 01:47:24,210
Right?

3705
01:47:24,210 --> 01:47:24,720
You're not kidding

3706
01:47:24,720 --> 01:47:26,290
It still hurts

3707
01:47:25,660 --> 01:47:26,290
It still hurts?

3708
01:47:26,290 --> 01:47:28,860
Is it just going to continue like this?

3709
01:47:27,250 --> 01:47:28,510
It really hurts, doesn't it?

3710
01:47:28,510 --> 01:47:28,860
From now

3711
01:47:28,860 --> 01:47:31,490
We're just gonna keep getting hit

3712
01:47:30,740 --> 01:47:32,030
They just keep coming!

3713
01:47:31,220 --> 01:47:32,030
Ouch

3714
01:47:32,030 --> 01:47:32,730
I'm going to get more white hair!

3715
01:47:32,730 --> 01:47:35,830
I'm going to get more white hair!

3716
01:47:33,330 --> 01:47:34,850
Your hair is going to turn pure white!

3717
01:47:35,980 --> 01:47:38,900
The arrival of the third Oni

3718
01:47:39,230 --> 01:47:39,470
What does it say?

3719
01:47:39,470 --> 01:47:40,030
What does it say?

3720
01:47:40,030 --> 01:47:41,770
Jeans?!

3721
01:47:42,120 --> 01:48:14,700
Jeans

3722
01:47:43,340 --> 01:47:43,840
This will be real bad!!

3723
01:47:43,840 --> 01:47:45,070
This will be real bad!!

3724
01:47:45,670 --> 01:47:48,240
This is bad!!

3725
01:47:47,390 --> 01:47:48,240
Jeans?!

3726
01:47:49,410 --> 01:47:50,580
Tanaka!!

3727
01:47:50,810 --> 01:47:53,110
Tanaka!!

3728
01:47:56,380 --> 01:47:57,350
Woo!

3729
01:47:57,900 --> 01:48:00,080
You said, "Woo!"

3730
01:47:59,410 --> 01:48:02,790
Tanaka lets his real thoughts slip

3731
01:48:01,890 --> 01:48:02,800
This'll hurt

3732
01:48:02,800 --> 01:48:04,200
Wait, you're kidding

3733
01:48:04,200 --> 01:48:05,720
This will hurt

3734
01:48:04,660 --> 01:48:05,720
Scary scary scary

3735
01:48:07,720 --> 01:48:09,220
That was a strong hit

3736
01:48:11,450 --> 01:48:12,840
Ow ow ow!

3737
01:48:12,840 --> 01:48:14,840
This is painful, this is really painful

3738
01:48:14,840 --> 01:48:15,810
Senpai!!

3739
01:48:14,840 --> 01:48:18,150
T/N: Senpai means upperclassman. Refers to someone who is older, higher in rank, someone you respect, etc.

3740
01:48:16,700 --> 01:48:17,860
What are you doing??

3741
01:48:17,290 --> 01:48:18,150
Senpai!

3742
01:48:17,590 --> 01:48:18,150
That's gotta hurt!

3743
01:48:19,350 --> 01:48:20,240
Senpai?

3744
01:48:20,240 --> 01:48:20,950
Senpai!

3745
01:48:20,950 --> 01:48:22,580
Are you okay, senpai?

3746
01:48:21,200 --> 01:48:22,580
Yeah yeah, I'm okay

3747
01:48:22,580 --> 01:48:23,530
That has to be really painful

3748
01:48:22,800 --> 01:48:23,890
No way, no way...

3749
01:48:23,530 --> 01:48:25,080
That's supposed to be something you wear!

3750
01:48:25,080 --> 01:48:26,280
That's right

3751
01:48:26,280 --> 01:48:28,690
I was scared, I thought he was going to go for my head

3752
01:48:28,690 --> 01:48:29,750
No way, they wouldn't...

3753
01:48:28,690 --> 01:48:30,990
Yes, that would be quite...

3754
01:48:29,750 --> 01:48:30,990
That was no good

3755
01:48:30,990 --> 01:48:31,990
That was, yeah...

3756
01:48:31,990 --> 01:48:33,130
Yeah, definitely hurts

3757
01:48:33,130 --> 01:48:36,270
I don't want this...

3758
01:48:33,930 --> 01:48:36,270
They're just gonna come swarming in

3759
01:48:37,110 --> 01:48:38,760
This is where it gets worse

3760
01:48:38,830 --> 01:48:41,260
You ran away, didn't you?

3761
01:48:41,260 --> 01:48:43,060
Yeah, you ran off

3762
01:48:43,040 --> 01:48:44,250
Wait a minute, what are you trying to say...

3763
01:48:43,560 --> 01:48:46,030
That was the moment your senpai was getting attacked, you know

3764
01:48:45,380 --> 01:48:46,030
No no no...

3765
01:48:46,030 --> 01:48:47,600
No no no, that's not... No...

3766
01:48:46,030 --> 01:48:47,600
Why wouldn't you stop and go take one for the team?

3767
01:48:47,600 --> 01:48:49,370
Why wouldn't you stop and go take one for the team?

3768
01:48:48,050 --> 01:48:49,370
Go take one for the team, damnit

3769
01:48:49,370 --> 01:48:50,800
Come on now, let's stop this

3770
01:48:50,800 --> 01:48:51,810
Everyone, let's be equals, none of this senpai/kouhai stuff

3771
01:48:50,800 --> 01:48:53,970
T/N: Kouhai means underclassman. Refers to someone who is younger, lower in rank, someone who looks up to you, etc.

3772
01:48:51,810 --> 01:48:53,970
Everyone, let's be equals, none of this senpai/kouhai stuff

3773
01:48:53,970 --> 01:48:54,680
For this year, let's not betray each other

3774
01:48:54,680 --> 01:48:56,980
For this year, let's not betray each other

3775
01:48:55,020 --> 01:48:56,160
Yes, let's stop this kind of thing

3776
01:48:56,160 --> 01:48:56,980
For this year

3777
01:48:57,090 --> 01:48:58,400
Those kinds of things...

3778
01:48:58,350 --> 01:48:59,050
If you're gonna say that, tell it to Hosei

3779
01:48:59,050 --> 01:49:00,680
If you're gonna say that, tell it to Hosei

3780
01:49:00,060 --> 01:49:01,570
For this year, please...

3781
01:49:00,680 --> 01:49:03,250
Seriously, please stop it!!

3782
01:49:03,250 --> 01:49:04,080
I've seen it every year, your betrayal

3783
01:49:03,860 --> 01:49:04,580
Yes!

3784
01:49:04,080 --> 01:49:05,390
I've seen it every year, your betrayal

3785
01:49:04,580 --> 01:49:05,390
He's like this, right?

3786
01:49:05,390 --> 01:49:08,190
No way, it's not like that

3787
01:49:06,740 --> 01:49:07,460
It's not?

3788
01:49:07,460 --> 01:49:08,240
No betrayals

3789
01:49:08,240 --> 01:49:10,260
When we're talking and there's one coming from behind...

3790
01:49:08,370 --> 01:49:14,130
Promises to
not betray this year

3791
01:49:09,970 --> 01:49:10,440
Right

3792
01:49:10,260 --> 01:49:12,900
And only you know it and you run away by yourself, don't do that

3793
01:49:11,000 --> 01:49:11,660
And you don't tell anyone

3794
01:49:12,580 --> 01:49:13,320
Won't do it anymore

3795
01:49:12,900 --> 01:49:14,160
Everyone should say, "It's here!"

3796
01:49:13,320 --> 01:49:14,160
When you see it, say, "It's here!"

3797
01:49:14,160 --> 01:49:15,730
Let's search for the key

3798
01:49:14,560 --> 01:49:16,290
Isn't it almost time for a punishment?

3799
01:49:15,730 --> 01:49:17,360
For now, let's try to...

3800
01:49:17,670 --> 01:49:20,800
Hosei sees
the Oni

3801
01:49:25,400 --> 01:49:26,800
He also used him as a wall

3802
01:49:25,690 --> 01:49:30,480
Hosei betrays without hesitation

3803
01:49:26,770 --> 01:49:27,900
You're right

3804
01:49:29,840 --> 01:49:30,480
The worst!

3805
01:49:30,480 --> 01:49:31,150
Hold on, you're kidding, right?!

3806
01:49:30,850 --> 01:49:59,510
Slippers

3807
01:49:31,130 --> 01:49:31,810
The worst!!

3808
01:49:31,150 --> 01:49:33,380
Hold on, you're kidding, right?!

3809
01:49:35,020 --> 01:49:36,880
Hold on...

3810
01:49:35,680 --> 01:49:36,880
All of a sudden

3811
01:49:36,880 --> 01:49:38,250
Tanaka escaped

3812
01:49:38,490 --> 01:49:42,190
The Oni gave up on Tanaka

3813
01:49:38,940 --> 01:49:40,170
I don't want this...

3814
01:49:41,340 --> 01:49:42,220
I don't like this

3815
01:49:42,220 --> 01:49:44,700
Hosei

3816
01:49:44,190 --> 01:49:45,570
Now it's getting fun

3817
01:49:45,570 --> 01:49:46,290
No, I don't like this

3818
01:49:46,290 --> 01:49:47,440
It's getting fun

3819
01:49:48,050 --> 01:49:49,060
You didn't tell everyone!!

3820
01:49:51,500 --> 01:49:52,970
Wait a minute... Tanaka

3821
01:49:52,970 --> 01:49:55,070
That guy didn't say anything!! Even though he saw the Oni

3822
01:49:57,000 --> 01:49:59,510
No way

3823
01:49:58,110 --> 01:49:59,510
Ouch ouch ouch

3824
01:50:00,010 --> 01:50:02,010
It's your doing

3825
01:50:01,460 --> 01:50:02,010
Hosei-san

3826
01:50:02,010 --> 01:50:02,980
Even though it was behind us, he pretended he didn't see

3827
01:50:02,010 --> 01:50:02,980
That was so bad

3828
01:50:02,980 --> 01:50:04,280
Even after all we talked about

3829
01:50:02,980 --> 01:50:04,280
Even though it was behind us, he pretended he didn't see

3830
01:50:04,280 --> 01:50:06,480
We just talked about stopping the betrayals

3831
01:50:06,480 --> 01:50:07,080
It wasn't a betrayal, you just weren't alert enough

3832
01:50:07,080 --> 01:50:09,850
It wasn't a betrayal, you just weren't alert enough

3833
01:50:09,850 --> 01:50:10,920
What about teamwork...

3834
01:50:10,920 --> 01:50:13,490
You guys aren't trying to help each other at all

3835
01:50:12,550 --> 01:50:13,520
Let's help each other

3836
01:50:13,520 --> 01:50:14,930
Yes, I agree

3837
01:50:13,520 --> 01:50:14,930
You're not helping each other

3838
01:50:14,930 --> 01:50:17,250
You have to pay attention 360° around you

3839
01:50:17,220 --> 01:50:20,190
Let's all work together and find the one key

3840
01:50:19,470 --> 01:50:20,190
That's what we should do

3841
01:50:19,940 --> 01:50:20,190
Yes

3842
01:50:20,200 --> 01:50:21,540
But right now...

3843
01:50:21,540 --> 01:50:22,660
The one that was unleashed was...

3844
01:50:22,790 --> 01:51:29,400
D*ck Machine

3845
01:50:29,900 --> 01:50:30,500
Hold on!

3846
01:50:30,500 --> 01:50:31,220
Wait WAIT

3847
01:50:30,670 --> 01:50:31,170
It's Muro

3848
01:50:31,170 --> 01:50:33,040
It's Muro

3849
01:50:31,220 --> 01:50:32,380
No, wait, hang on

3850
01:50:32,380 --> 01:50:33,240
Not me, not me!

3851
01:50:33,240 --> 01:50:33,370
Wait

3852
01:50:33,370 --> 01:50:33,510
Wait

3853
01:50:33,510 --> 01:50:34,010
Wait

3854
01:50:34,010 --> 01:50:34,140
Wait

3855
01:50:34,140 --> 01:50:34,270
Wait

3856
01:50:34,270 --> 01:50:34,880
Wait

3857
01:50:34,880 --> 01:50:35,680
Wait up

3858
01:50:35,680 --> 01:50:36,480
Wait up

3859
01:50:36,480 --> 01:50:37,340
Wait up

3860
01:50:37,340 --> 01:50:39,580
What is it? What is it?? What?

3861
01:50:39,580 --> 01:50:41,580
He was locked on by the D*ck Machine Oni

3862
01:50:39,930 --> 01:50:40,850
Dick Machine

3863
01:50:42,050 --> 01:50:43,380
Why me?   Explain this

3864
01:50:43,380 --> 01:50:45,790
Why me?   Explain this

3865
01:50:45,790 --> 01:50:46,720
Yep

3866
01:50:46,720 --> 01:50:48,080
Can't avoid it, the guests of the show...

3867
01:50:47,390 --> 01:50:48,860
This is a baptism

3868
01:50:48,860 --> 01:50:50,720
Gaki baptism

3869
01:50:50,010 --> 01:50:50,720
You're right

3870
01:50:50,770 --> 01:50:52,200
Oh, this is...

3871
01:50:52,200 --> 01:50:53,800
Muro

3872
01:50:53,800 --> 01:50:55,010
This is just...

3873
01:50:55,010 --> 01:50:57,290
If you appear on Gaki as a guest, you gotta...

3874
01:50:56,020 --> 01:50:56,960
Sorry, sorry

3875
01:50:56,960 --> 01:50:58,000
This will hurt

3876
01:50:57,290 --> 01:50:58,000
What??

3877
01:50:58,000 --> 01:50:58,540
Here it goes

3878
01:50:58,500 --> 01:51:00,070
Mine's small, for your information

3879
01:51:00,050 --> 01:51:02,260
3, 2, 1

3880
01:51:03,970 --> 01:51:05,700
Ow ow ow ow ow

3881
01:51:04,330 --> 01:51:05,700
Ow ow ow

3882
01:51:07,710 --> 01:51:09,780
Ow ow ow ow ow

3883
01:51:14,460 --> 01:51:15,860
That's gotta hurt

3884
01:51:14,810 --> 01:51:19,050
Direct hit on Muro

3885
01:51:15,860 --> 01:51:16,450
So painful

3886
01:51:16,450 --> 01:51:17,170
Are you okay?

3887
01:51:17,170 --> 01:51:18,550
That was fast

3888
01:51:19,050 --> 01:51:20,620
What is going on? Make it stop

3889
01:51:20,620 --> 01:51:21,860
What is going on? Make it stop

3890
01:51:22,860 --> 01:51:25,230
The tip...

3891
01:51:25,230 --> 01:51:25,890
The tip...

3892
01:51:27,730 --> 01:51:30,830
Matsumoto-san's face right then

3893
01:51:30,830 --> 01:51:34,130
He's giving you a really grim look

3894
01:51:32,020 --> 01:51:34,020
When it gets the tip, I understand...

3895
01:51:34,130 --> 01:51:35,440
Hurry it up

3896
01:51:35,740 --> 01:51:38,810
They key isn't in the grounds area

3897
01:51:38,810 --> 01:51:39,810
So we'll check the school building

3898
01:51:39,420 --> 01:51:39,860
Okay

3899
01:51:40,510 --> 01:51:42,910
It's always like that!!

3900
01:51:41,860 --> 01:51:42,910
Always, yes

3901
01:51:42,910 --> 01:51:44,380
Well then, let's just not go

3902
01:51:44,380 --> 01:51:45,710
When he says it like that, yeah

3903
01:51:45,710 --> 01:51:47,410
Why is he so mad...

3904
01:51:47,410 --> 01:51:48,020
We're just doing our best to save Matsumoto-san

3905
01:51:48,020 --> 01:51:50,350
We're just doing our best to save Matsumoto-san

3906
01:51:49,010 --> 01:51:50,350
I agree

3907
01:51:51,520 --> 01:51:53,220
What the hell do you think you're doing?

3908
01:51:53,230 --> 01:51:54,620
No, no, no

3909
01:51:54,620 --> 01:51:55,760
What are you doing?

3910
01:51:55,760 --> 01:51:56,460
Just hurry up and go ahead!!

3911
01:51:56,460 --> 01:51:57,990
Just hurry up and go ahead!!

3912
01:51:58,430 --> 01:52:01,130
Muro, go and listen to what he wants to say

3913
01:51:59,780 --> 01:52:01,130
We'll leave it to you

3914
01:52:01,130 --> 01:52:02,330
What should I ask him?

3915
01:52:02,330 --> 01:52:03,800
He's saying something, so just go

3916
01:52:03,800 --> 01:52:04,330
Hey...

3917
01:52:04,330 --> 01:52:04,800
I've never really talked with Matsumoto before

3918
01:52:04,800 --> 01:52:06,470
I've never really talked with Matsumoto before

3919
01:52:06,470 --> 01:52:08,170
You can take this chance to do so

3920
01:52:07,050 --> 01:52:07,950
That's right

3921
01:52:07,950 --> 01:52:08,700
We're counting on you

3922
01:52:08,700 --> 01:52:11,130
The hat guy was called over

3923
01:52:09,740 --> 01:52:11,040
Matsumoto-san, what's the matter?

3924
01:52:10,430 --> 01:52:11,040
Yes, yes?

3925
01:52:11,040 --> 01:52:12,140
Matsumoto-san, what's the matter?

3926
01:52:11,580 --> 01:52:12,140
No, no

3927
01:52:12,140 --> 01:52:13,740
That's what I want to say

3928
01:52:13,120 --> 01:52:14,570
What are you guys doing? The time...

3929
01:52:14,570 --> 01:52:16,680
The way you word your requests doesn't seem nice

3930
01:52:16,680 --> 01:52:17,630
Matsumoto-san, the way

3931
01:52:17,630 --> 01:52:19,680
You word your requests...

3932
01:52:18,600 --> 01:52:19,680
No, it's not that

3933
01:52:19,680 --> 01:52:22,080
It's pretty tough here too, actually

3934
01:52:21,080 --> 01:52:22,080
Even though it may not seem so

3935
01:52:22,080 --> 01:52:23,780
It doesn't seem that way to me from here

3936
01:52:23,280 --> 01:52:23,790
No, no

3937
01:52:24,080 --> 01:52:25,350
It's really hot in here and there's no wind

3938
01:52:25,350 --> 01:52:26,190
It's really hot in here and there's no wind

3939
01:52:26,190 --> 01:52:28,320
It doesn't seem that way to me from here

3940
01:52:28,320 --> 01:52:29,320
If you ask properly,

3941
01:52:29,320 --> 01:52:30,920
I'm sure everyone will agree to go search for the key

3942
01:52:31,460 --> 01:52:33,760
It feels like New Japan here

3943
01:52:31,460 --> 01:52:33,760
T/N: New Japan is an establishment famous for their saunas in Osaka that also has a capsule hotel, fine dining, bars, spas, and gym.

3944
01:52:32,380 --> 01:52:33,760
I like New Japan

3945
01:52:33,760 --> 01:52:34,630
I go there often

3946
01:52:35,100 --> 01:52:37,580
That guy's really good

3947
01:52:36,000 --> 01:52:39,330
Everyone, seems he's going to ask now

3948
01:52:37,580 --> 01:52:38,000
Oh, really?

3949
01:52:37,580 --> 01:52:38,000
Okay

3950
01:52:38,000 --> 01:52:39,030
Please look over here

3951
01:52:39,030 --> 01:52:40,230
Matsumoto-san, if you please

3952
01:52:40,230 --> 01:52:41,970
Sorry

3953
01:52:40,800 --> 01:52:41,970
Please help me

3954
01:52:41,970 --> 01:52:43,700
Please say it more clearly

3955
01:52:43,700 --> 01:52:45,410
I ask of you to please help me

3956
01:52:45,410 --> 01:52:46,910
He asked us to help him

3957
01:52:46,910 --> 01:52:48,880
Yeah, we got it

3958
01:52:48,010 --> 01:52:48,870
Looks like they understand

3959
01:52:48,910 --> 01:52:50,510
Then please enjoy New Japan

3960
01:52:50,510 --> 01:52:52,080
Who could enjoy this!!

3961
01:52:52,980 --> 01:52:56,320
Matsumoto bowed his head

3962
01:52:54,600 --> 01:52:55,530
We heard it

3963
01:52:55,110 --> 01:52:55,530
Yes

3964
01:52:55,530 --> 01:52:56,320
Matsumoto...

3965
01:52:55,530 --> 01:52:56,530
We heard his voice too

3966
01:52:56,320 --> 01:52:57,420
He bowed and asked

3967
01:52:57,420 --> 01:52:59,170
So please help search

3968
01:52:57,750 --> 01:52:59,170
New Japan?

3969
01:53:01,520 --> 01:53:05,130
Matsumoto's punishment
will be carried out

3970
01:53:03,960 --> 01:53:05,130
Ah, this part

3971
01:53:05,230 --> 01:53:07,560
Something came out

3972
01:53:05,980 --> 01:53:06,600
Yeah, something

3973
01:53:06,600 --> 01:53:07,560
Again...

3974
01:53:07,830 --> 01:53:25,910
TKO Kinoshita

3975
01:53:07,900 --> 01:53:11,000
It's that "I'm now able to stand up" character

3976
01:53:07,900 --> 01:53:14,000
T/N: TKO Kinoshita is the boke half of the TKO duo. He plays the role of a toy who comes to life and is learning to speak and stand like a human, but it comes off as really creepy.

3977
01:53:11,000 --> 01:53:13,200
My hand is now able to inflate

3978
01:53:13,180 --> 01:53:15,950
My hand is now able to inflate

3979
01:53:15,950 --> 01:53:17,870
My hand is now able to inflate

3980
01:53:17,070 --> 01:53:17,870
Oh it's starting

3981
01:53:24,600 --> 01:53:25,910
Aarrrgghhh!!

3982
01:53:26,110 --> 01:53:29,120
What's with that?

3983
01:53:26,810 --> 01:53:29,100
"My hand is now able to inflate"

3984
01:53:29,450 --> 01:53:31,250
My back hurts

3985
01:53:32,350 --> 01:53:35,220
It has been 15 minutes since the training started

3986
01:53:35,390 --> 01:53:39,590
Search the courtyard

3987
01:53:36,170 --> 01:53:37,580
The 5 decide to

3988
01:53:37,580 --> 01:53:39,590
go to the courtyard.

3989
01:53:39,590 --> 01:53:41,530
Is he wearing weights or something?

3990
01:53:40,510 --> 01:53:41,530
Ah... Yeah

3991
01:53:40,860 --> 01:54:15,130
American Football

3992
01:53:41,530 --> 01:53:42,430
An Oni's coming over!!

3993
01:53:41,980 --> 01:53:43,830
He's coming over

3994
01:53:43,840 --> 01:53:45,360
An Oni

3995
01:53:44,380 --> 01:53:46,170
The Oni's here

3996
01:53:45,350 --> 01:53:46,170
Go there

3997
01:53:46,170 --> 01:53:46,900
Who is it?

3998
01:53:46,900 --> 01:53:48,470
Aarrgghh!!

3999
01:53:48,470 --> 01:53:50,380
Whoa... No way...

4000
01:53:50,740 --> 01:53:51,340
What is it?

4001
01:53:51,450 --> 01:53:53,280
What's this?

4002
01:53:51,800 --> 01:53:53,270
American Football

4003
01:53:53,280 --> 01:53:54,560
Wah... Wait...

4004
01:53:54,560 --> 01:53:54,980
Wait a bit!

4005
01:53:54,980 --> 01:53:56,650
Now? W-wait...

4006
01:53:56,650 --> 01:53:58,480
What? What?

4007
01:53:57,050 --> 01:53:58,480
Scary...

4008
01:53:58,480 --> 01:54:00,550
Quite a number of them came over!!

4009
01:53:59,560 --> 01:54:00,550
Huh?

4010
01:54:00,550 --> 01:54:01,520
Wow... They're coming over...

4011
01:54:01,520 --> 01:54:02,760
It's kinda scary...

4012
01:54:02,750 --> 01:54:04,170
Wait... I can't see...

4013
01:54:03,620 --> 01:54:05,420
No way?!

4014
01:54:04,170 --> 01:54:05,420
Oh no!

4015
01:54:04,170 --> 01:54:05,420
Wait, what, what?

4016
01:54:05,560 --> 01:54:06,680
Whoa... Oh no!

4017
01:54:06,680 --> 01:54:07,560
Wait...

4018
01:54:07,560 --> 01:54:08,920
Stop, stop

4019
01:54:08,920 --> 01:54:10,440
Stop!

4020
01:54:09,690 --> 01:54:10,440
Wha- No way!

4021
01:54:11,100 --> 01:54:12,690
No way?!

4022
01:54:11,100 --> 01:54:12,690
Ow!

4023
01:54:12,690 --> 01:54:14,690
No way?!

4024
01:54:14,690 --> 01:54:16,690
No way?!

4025
01:54:21,030 --> 01:54:22,370
He's really good

4026
01:54:22,700 --> 01:54:26,070
Muro is impressed
by the kicker

4027
01:54:22,860 --> 01:54:24,310
He's really good

4028
01:54:26,150 --> 01:54:27,070
It hurts...

4029
01:54:27,070 --> 01:54:29,440
This is the start of hell. Seriously.

4030
01:54:29,590 --> 01:54:34,380
They split into two
groups to search

4031
01:54:30,090 --> 01:54:31,600
The 5 split into two groups

4032
01:54:31,600 --> 01:54:34,380
In order to search for the key

4033
01:54:35,450 --> 01:55:17,160
Super Sticky Tape

4034
01:54:45,690 --> 01:54:47,460
You guys noticed the Oni coming, didn't you?

4035
01:54:47,460 --> 01:54:48,360
No, not at all!!

4036
01:54:48,360 --> 01:54:49,760
No, not at all!!

4037
01:54:49,760 --> 01:54:50,160
Uwaa they're here!!

4038
01:54:50,160 --> 01:54:51,630
Whoa, they're here!!

4039
01:54:52,830 --> 01:54:54,640
This is terrible

4040
01:54:54,640 --> 01:54:55,640
Sticky tape...

4041
01:54:54,640 --> 01:54:56,070
Really terrible

4042
01:54:56,060 --> 01:54:58,220
Wha? What?

4043
01:54:57,000 --> 01:54:58,220
Wow, this really is horrible

4044
01:54:59,180 --> 01:55:00,650
Super scary

4045
01:55:00,790 --> 01:55:01,340
No way

4046
01:55:01,340 --> 01:55:03,010
This is terrible!!

4047
01:55:05,810 --> 01:55:07,650
Huh?

4048
01:55:08,250 --> 01:55:09,880
Huh?

4049
01:55:09,880 --> 01:55:11,420
There's quite a large number of people doing something there

4050
01:55:11,790 --> 01:55:12,190
When did that happen?

4051
01:55:12,190 --> 01:55:13,920
When did that happen?

4052
01:55:15,760 --> 01:55:17,160
WHOA!!

4053
01:55:19,330 --> 01:55:21,060
Scary, scary

4054
01:55:20,590 --> 01:55:21,060
Whoa...

4055
01:55:21,060 --> 01:55:22,560
That's Hamada-san

4056
01:55:22,160 --> 01:55:23,200
Scary!

4057
01:55:22,560 --> 01:55:23,200
Come over...

4058
01:55:23,200 --> 01:55:24,020
Hamada-san?

4059
01:55:24,010 --> 01:55:24,870
Scary...

4060
01:55:24,700 --> 01:55:26,600
Scary, scary...

4061
01:55:27,570 --> 01:55:28,740
He was turned into a monster

4062
01:55:29,070 --> 01:55:33,740
Hamada, who got
turned into a monster

4063
01:55:29,730 --> 01:55:31,020
Hey...

4064
01:55:30,090 --> 01:55:31,020
A monster...

4065
01:55:31,020 --> 01:55:32,670
You noticed the Oni and ran away

4066
01:55:32,670 --> 01:55:33,740
No, I didn't notice

4067
01:55:33,740 --> 01:55:36,310
Shut up, you monster!!

4068
01:55:38,150 --> 01:55:40,450
Scary

4069
01:55:40,710 --> 01:55:43,280
Don't say it's scary

4070
01:55:41,410 --> 01:55:41,950
No, no

4071
01:55:41,950 --> 01:55:43,280
Scary...

4072
01:55:43,620 --> 01:55:45,650
Please return Hamada-san

4073
01:55:45,990 --> 01:55:48,520
Don't just rest here, go...

4074
01:55:48,520 --> 01:55:50,590
Don't run away!!

4075
01:55:50,590 --> 01:55:50,660
What are you trying to do!!

4076
01:55:50,660 --> 01:55:50,720
What are you trying to do!!

4077
01:55:50,720 --> 01:55:50,790
What are you trying to do!!

4078
01:55:50,790 --> 01:55:50,860
What are you trying to do!!

4079
01:55:50,860 --> 01:55:50,920
What are you trying to do!!

4080
01:55:50,920 --> 01:55:51,990
What are you trying to do!!

4081
01:55:52,260 --> 01:55:54,360
What did you plan on doing to us?

4082
01:55:53,290 --> 01:55:53,360
Damn you!!

4083
01:55:53,360 --> 01:55:53,430
Damn you!!

4084
01:55:53,430 --> 01:55:53,490
Damn you!!

4085
01:55:53,490 --> 01:55:53,560
Damn you!!

4086
01:55:53,560 --> 01:55:54,360
Damn you!!

4087
01:55:55,540 --> 01:55:56,500
We're...

4088
01:55:56,500 --> 01:55:58,030
We're comrades, aren't we?

4089
01:55:58,200 --> 01:56:00,130
We're not comrades!

4090
01:55:58,970 --> 01:55:59,030
Idiot!!

4091
01:55:59,030 --> 01:55:59,100
Idiot!!

4092
01:55:59,100 --> 01:55:59,170
Idiot!!

4093
01:55:59,170 --> 01:55:59,230
Idiot!!

4094
01:55:59,230 --> 01:56:00,130
Idiot!!

4095
01:56:01,970 --> 01:56:03,770
Please turn back into Hamada!!

4096
01:56:03,770 --> 01:56:05,850
Please turn back into Hamada!!

4097
01:56:04,380 --> 01:56:05,840
Return Hamada-san!!

4098
01:56:05,840 --> 01:56:07,840
Return Hamada-san!

4099
01:56:07,840 --> 01:56:08,710
Return Hamada-san to us!! Hurry up!!

4100
01:56:08,710 --> 01:56:10,080
Return Hamada-san to us!! Hurry up!!

4101
01:56:10,080 --> 01:56:11,330
You guys also...

4102
01:56:11,330 --> 01:56:13,310
Had the possibility of having this done to you

4103
01:56:13,310 --> 01:56:14,920
His voice is totally muffled

4104
01:56:14,920 --> 01:56:16,520
What are you saying!?

4105
01:56:15,820 --> 01:56:16,520
Good

4106
01:56:16,820 --> 01:56:17,890
Rather than that...

4107
01:56:17,890 --> 01:56:18,740
Let's talk...

4108
01:56:20,380 --> 01:56:21,920
Return Hamada-san to us!

4109
01:56:21,920 --> 01:56:22,790
Monster!!

4110
01:56:22,790 --> 01:56:24,320
Monster!!

4111
01:56:24,440 --> 01:56:27,330
That wasn't the time to play around...

4112
01:56:25,260 --> 01:56:26,660
You've shown your true colours!!

4113
01:56:26,660 --> 01:56:29,300
Hey!!

4114
01:56:28,290 --> 01:56:29,300
Enough is enough!!

4115
01:56:30,050 --> 01:56:32,000
Now I've turned into someone like Yamasaki

4116
01:56:32,200 --> 01:56:33,500
Was that a cry of rage?

4117
01:56:33,500 --> 01:56:37,540
Hey!!

4118
01:56:35,940 --> 01:56:36,000
Enough is enough!!

4119
01:56:36,000 --> 01:56:36,070
Enough is enough!!

4120
01:56:36,070 --> 01:56:36,140
Enough is enough!!

4121
01:56:36,140 --> 01:56:36,200
Enough is enough!!

4122
01:56:36,200 --> 01:56:36,270
Enough is enough!!

4123
01:56:36,270 --> 01:56:37,540
Enough is enough!!

4124
01:56:37,540 --> 01:56:38,740
Oh, this way of getting angry?

4125
01:56:38,740 --> 01:56:39,870
Are you Masatoshi-san?

4126
01:56:38,740 --> 01:56:44,180
T/N: "Masatoshi" is Hamada's first name. The way they his first name with -san at the end makes it sound like he's a stranger and it comes off as rude since Hamada is older than them and should be referred by his last name.

4127
01:56:39,870 --> 01:56:40,470
You guys...

4128
01:56:40,470 --> 01:56:42,510
Stop joking around

4129
01:56:42,510 --> 01:56:44,180
What do you mean by "Masatoshi-san"?

4130
01:56:44,380 --> 01:56:46,450
You saw me getting this done to me, didn't you?

4131
01:56:47,040 --> 01:56:50,450
20 minutes have passed since the training started

4132
01:56:50,620 --> 01:56:54,350
Matsumoto's punishment
will be carried out

4133
01:56:51,010 --> 01:56:52,440
Matsumoto's punishment

4134
01:56:52,440 --> 01:56:54,350
Will be carried out

4135
01:57:00,370 --> 01:57:02,200
Why the hell?

4136
01:57:00,830 --> 01:58:04,790
TKO Kinoshita

4137
01:57:02,200 --> 01:57:04,100
I'm now able to wind the tape

4138
01:57:04,100 --> 01:57:06,380
I'm now able to wind the tape

4139
01:57:06,200 --> 01:57:08,470
Seriously?

4140
01:57:06,380 --> 01:57:08,470
I'm now able to wind the tape

4141
01:57:07,700 --> 01:57:08,630
That's right

4142
01:57:08,630 --> 01:57:13,340
Super sticky tape to be
put on Matsumoto too

4143
01:57:08,870 --> 01:57:11,300
Yes, it is

4144
01:57:11,300 --> 01:57:13,390
We didn't know this happened at all

4145
01:57:12,720 --> 01:57:16,400
I didn't know you guys' situation either

4146
01:57:14,720 --> 01:57:16,480
Wh-what, what?

4147
01:57:15,220 --> 01:57:16,400
That's true

4148
01:57:16,980 --> 01:57:19,280
I'm winding it around your head

4149
01:57:18,440 --> 01:57:19,260
No, no, no

4150
01:57:19,680 --> 01:57:20,690
No, no, no, no

4151
01:57:20,690 --> 01:57:22,170
No, w-

4152
01:57:25,950 --> 01:57:28,460
So cute

4153
01:57:29,490 --> 01:57:33,360
I'm going to continue winding the tape

4154
01:57:31,870 --> 01:57:33,360
Right

4155
01:57:34,920 --> 01:57:36,320
Can you see a little?

4156
01:57:41,240 --> 01:57:43,620
Amazing

4157
01:57:41,850 --> 01:57:43,620
I'm continuing

4158
01:57:43,530 --> 01:57:45,070
So that's how much he wound the tape

4159
01:57:44,570 --> 01:57:45,070
I'm doing it

4160
01:57:45,070 --> 01:57:45,410
Ow

4161
01:57:45,410 --> 01:57:45,670
Ouch

4162
01:57:45,670 --> 01:57:47,240
Hand that to me

4163
01:57:45,670 --> 01:57:47,240
It hurts

4164
01:57:47,240 --> 01:57:49,440
That was what I looked like?

4165
01:57:48,410 --> 01:57:48,910
Hey

4166
01:57:48,910 --> 01:57:49,440
Hey

4167
01:57:49,440 --> 01:57:50,190
This is really messed up

4168
01:57:50,190 --> 01:57:54,080
Your face has been crushed

4169
01:57:52,920 --> 01:57:54,080
Yeah

4170
01:57:54,810 --> 01:57:56,730
So Matsumoto had this done to him

4171
01:57:56,730 --> 01:57:59,670
What an amazing face

4172
01:57:57,850 --> 01:57:59,670
What's the staff thinking...?

4173
01:57:59,670 --> 01:58:01,090
Scary, scary

4174
01:58:01,090 --> 01:58:02,920
Huh?

4175
01:58:02,000 --> 01:58:03,580
It's scary

4176
01:58:04,440 --> 01:58:05,830
Really looks scary

4177
01:58:05,130 --> 01:58:08,560
It feels really...

4178
01:58:05,830 --> 01:58:06,890
Our faces

4179
01:58:06,770 --> 01:58:08,560
No, it definitely...

4180
01:58:07,380 --> 01:58:08,560
Downtown looks scary

4181
01:58:08,710 --> 01:58:13,500
Downtown, 35 years in
the entertainment industry

4182
01:58:11,320 --> 01:58:12,640
Stop it

4183
01:58:13,710 --> 01:58:15,530
That's right

4184
01:58:13,720 --> 01:58:44,630
Harisen

4185
01:58:15,530 --> 01:58:16,540
Hey, hey

4186
01:58:16,540 --> 01:58:17,960
Huh?!

4187
01:58:18,640 --> 01:58:19,610
Wait, wait...

4188
01:58:19,610 --> 01:58:20,210
Uwah! Ouch!!

4189
01:58:20,210 --> 01:58:22,310
Uwah! Ouch!!

4190
01:58:21,600 --> 01:58:23,550
What the hell is this?

4191
01:58:22,580 --> 01:58:23,540
Urgh...

4192
01:58:23,680 --> 01:58:27,380
My ear hurts more than the smack on the head did

4193
01:58:27,380 --> 01:58:29,980
Was my ear torn? Does it look okay?

4194
01:58:29,980 --> 01:58:31,220
Was my ear torn? Does it look okay?

4195
01:58:31,450 --> 01:58:33,180
There's buzzing in my ears...

4196
01:58:32,120 --> 01:58:34,590
Your ear has a cut on it?

4197
01:58:33,170 --> 01:58:34,590
There's a buzzing...

4198
01:58:34,590 --> 01:58:35,560
There's a cut on it, right?

4199
01:58:35,720 --> 01:58:36,690
Did it get torn?

4200
01:58:36,690 --> 01:58:38,890
I really am a monster now, if that's so

4201
01:58:37,600 --> 01:58:38,890
Who knows

4202
01:58:39,160 --> 01:58:41,290
Your eyebrows look really interesting now

4203
01:58:41,290 --> 01:58:42,090
Seriously?

4204
01:58:42,090 --> 01:58:43,030
That's right

4205
01:58:43,030 --> 01:58:44,630
I say you look like a monster.

4206
01:58:47,870 --> 01:58:50,470
This is amazing

4207
01:58:50,060 --> 01:58:53,450
I didn't know when this was gonna end

4208
01:58:52,640 --> 01:58:53,440
That's right

4209
01:58:53,340 --> 01:59:20,270
Super Sticky Tape

4210
01:58:53,440 --> 01:58:54,790
Maybe it did get cut...

4211
01:58:53,810 --> 01:58:54,210
The Oni's here again!!

4212
01:58:54,210 --> 01:58:54,470
The Oni's here again!!

4213
01:58:54,470 --> 01:58:55,340
The Oni's here again!!

4214
01:58:56,340 --> 01:58:57,600
When did the Oni arrive?

4215
01:58:57,600 --> 01:58:58,640
It's a dead end here

4216
01:58:58,640 --> 01:59:00,600
It's a dead end here

4217
01:58:59,420 --> 01:59:00,600
Yes!! It's not me

4218
01:59:00,600 --> 01:59:01,520
Huh?

4219
01:59:00,600 --> 01:59:01,520
Why?

4220
01:59:01,930 --> 01:59:03,620
Oh?

4221
01:59:03,620 --> 01:59:04,890
Ow, ow, ow

4222
01:59:05,110 --> 01:59:07,180
Right...

4223
01:59:05,180 --> 01:59:05,700
Looks like it hurts

4224
01:59:05,700 --> 01:59:07,170
It really does

4225
01:59:06,500 --> 01:59:07,460
ow, ow, OW!

4226
01:59:06,860 --> 01:59:07,450
Think his injury hurts

4227
01:59:07,450 --> 01:59:08,020
More suffering

4228
01:59:08,020 --> 01:59:09,720
Peel it off for him

4229
01:59:09,720 --> 01:59:11,160
Ouch, ow, ow

4230
01:59:11,160 --> 01:59:11,940
Seems painful

4231
01:59:11,940 --> 01:59:13,170
This kind of secondary suffering exists too?

4232
01:59:14,330 --> 01:59:15,130
It hurts!

4233
01:59:15,130 --> 01:59:16,740
Oh no

4234
01:59:16,750 --> 01:59:18,860
This part is dreadful

4235
01:59:26,240 --> 01:59:31,480
Matsumoto's punishment
will be carried out

4236
01:59:31,480 --> 01:59:33,460
I came to peel the tape off

4237
01:59:31,730 --> 02:00:31,540
TKO Kinoshita

4238
01:59:33,460 --> 01:59:36,120
I came to peel the tape off

4239
01:59:36,980 --> 01:59:38,950
I'm peeling it off

4240
01:59:38,060 --> 01:59:39,470
It was scary

4241
01:59:39,650 --> 01:59:40,520
It's scary

4242
01:59:40,520 --> 01:59:41,390
Ow, ow...

4243
01:59:41,390 --> 01:59:42,660
I'm doing it slowly

4244
01:59:42,660 --> 01:59:42,860
Where, where?

4245
01:59:42,860 --> 01:59:44,560
Where, where?

4246
01:59:44,560 --> 01:59:45,990
I can't find where the tape starts

4247
01:59:45,990 --> 01:59:48,830
I can't find where the tape starts

4248
01:59:48,950 --> 01:59:50,570
You were the one who did it!

4249
01:59:51,450 --> 01:59:52,710
What does he mean by "start"?

4250
01:59:53,410 --> 01:59:54,700
Shouldn't he say, "end"?

4251
01:59:53,800 --> 01:59:55,840
I'm panicking

4252
01:59:57,100 --> 02:00:00,740
Ah, here it is, here. I'm doing it slowly

4253
02:00:00,740 --> 02:00:03,310
I'm doing it slowly

4254
02:00:01,720 --> 02:00:03,320
Ow, ow, ow

4255
02:00:02,650 --> 02:00:03,810
It hurts?

4256
02:00:03,810 --> 02:00:05,280
Ouch!

4257
02:00:04,290 --> 02:00:05,280
It hurts, right?

4258
02:00:05,280 --> 02:00:06,880
It hurts.

4259
02:00:06,880 --> 02:00:07,840
Where are you hurting?

4260
02:00:07,840 --> 02:00:09,320
It's painful here?

4261
02:00:09,320 --> 02:00:10,950
It's painful here

4262
02:00:10,950 --> 02:00:12,350
It hurts, right?

4263
02:00:12,350 --> 02:00:14,290
That hurts, right?

4264
02:00:14,280 --> 02:00:15,610
When I'm taking this off

4265
02:00:15,050 --> 02:00:15,600
Ow, ow, ow...

4266
02:00:15,610 --> 02:00:16,100
Wait a bit

4267
02:00:16,100 --> 02:00:17,060
That hurts, right?

4268
02:00:17,060 --> 02:00:19,330
The back of your head hurts

4269
02:00:18,170 --> 02:00:20,060
It's painful

4270
02:00:20,060 --> 02:00:21,640
Ouch!

4271
02:00:20,380 --> 02:00:21,630
It's painful, right?

4272
02:00:22,480 --> 02:00:24,130
That part's painful

4273
02:00:25,600 --> 02:00:27,270
It was really painful!!

4274
02:00:27,270 --> 02:00:29,500
I'm sorry

4275
02:00:28,380 --> 02:00:29,640
Seriously...

4276
02:00:32,020 --> 02:00:34,410
That was really messed up

4277
02:00:36,440 --> 02:00:36,840
Right, the Oni's locked on to someone

4278
02:00:36,840 --> 02:00:38,910
Right, the Oni's locked on to someone

4279
02:00:44,240 --> 02:00:45,480
Okay, what Oni?

4280
02:00:45,480 --> 02:00:46,050
What?

4281
02:00:46,050 --> 02:00:47,350
What's written there?

4282
02:00:47,050 --> 02:01:03,670
Marie Antoinette

4283
02:00:47,350 --> 02:00:48,290
Marie...

4284
02:00:48,290 --> 02:00:48,970
Antoinette?

4285
02:00:48,970 --> 02:00:49,990
Marie Antoinette.

4286
02:00:49,990 --> 02:00:52,360
It says Marie Antoinette

4287
02:00:51,020 --> 02:00:52,360
Marie Antoinette?

4288
02:00:52,360 --> 02:00:53,090
I don't know

4289
02:00:53,260 --> 02:00:54,530
The guillotine...

4290
02:00:53,260 --> 02:00:57,970
T/N: Marie Antoinette was born in Austria and was the Queen of France from 1770 to 1791. She was executed by guillotine in 1793.

4291
02:00:54,230 --> 02:00:55,030
It's a person's name, isn't it?

4292
02:00:54,530 --> 02:00:55,830
Isn't it?

4293
02:00:57,970 --> 02:00:59,300
Huh?

4294
02:00:59,500 --> 02:01:00,770
What?

4295
02:01:00,770 --> 02:01:02,670
He's going into a room...

4296
02:01:02,670 --> 02:01:03,670
We wait here

4297
02:01:03,670 --> 02:01:05,740
What's Marie Antoinette?

4298
02:01:05,740 --> 02:01:06,670
What's that?

4299
02:01:06,840 --> 02:01:08,000
Is she a musician?

4300
02:01:06,840 --> 02:01:13,050
The 3 who don't know
who Marie Antoinette is

4301
02:01:07,970 --> 02:01:09,970
No, I don't think so

4302
02:01:08,720 --> 02:01:10,260
I don't know

4303
02:01:10,260 --> 02:01:11,200
A person?

4304
02:01:11,010 --> 02:01:12,130
Haha

4305
02:01:11,200 --> 02:01:12,700
Yeah, it's a person

4306
02:01:12,130 --> 02:01:14,130
A person

4307
02:01:19,290 --> 02:01:19,880
Oh no no no...

4308
02:01:20,460 --> 02:01:21,780
There's no context

4309
02:01:22,460 --> 02:01:24,460
What is this?

4310
02:01:22,460 --> 02:01:26,330
An elegant entrance

4311
02:01:25,860 --> 02:01:28,020
Why are you doing this Hosei?

4312
02:01:27,970 --> 02:01:30,520
That face is too much

4313
02:01:30,700 --> 02:01:32,570
Hosei you won't be able to get away

4314
02:01:32,670 --> 02:01:34,480
I'm screwed

4315
02:01:34,480 --> 02:01:36,010
We won't be able to hear someone coming

4316
02:01:36,310 --> 02:01:38,890
Yeah there are a ton of bells

4317
02:01:38,890 --> 02:01:40,280
I'm Marie Antoinette

4318
02:01:40,280 --> 02:01:41,510
It's kinda funny

4319
02:01:41,980 --> 02:01:42,920
Let's get searching

4320
02:01:42,920 --> 02:01:44,780
and we should stay together as a group

4321
02:01:43,770 --> 02:01:44,700
There really is bells

4322
02:01:44,780 --> 02:01:46,250
Hosei-san you're seriously in the way

4323
02:01:45,830 --> 02:01:46,250
Move in a group!

4324
02:01:46,540 --> 02:01:47,110
We will!

4325
02:01:47,500 --> 02:01:48,310
If you're nearby they'll know we're here

4326
02:01:48,310 --> 02:01:49,560
If you're nearby they'll know we're here

4327
02:01:49,050 --> 02:01:50,580
Yeah, if Yama-chan's here, they'll know

4328
02:01:50,600 --> 02:01:52,330
Move as a group...

4329
02:01:51,620 --> 02:01:52,540
But a group...

4330
02:01:52,330 --> 02:01:52,580
No way!

4331
02:01:52,580 --> 02:01:52,890
No way!

4332
02:01:52,890 --> 02:01:53,180
No way!

4333
02:01:53,190 --> 02:01:55,100
Moving in groups is out of the question!

4334
02:01:54,200 --> 02:01:54,980
You're so loud!

4335
02:01:55,100 --> 02:01:56,800
They're gonna find us!

4336
02:01:56,800 --> 02:01:57,960
They'll be drawn to us

4337
02:01:58,020 --> 02:02:00,330
When you run you make so much noise!

4338
02:02:00,980 --> 02:02:03,420
Shuffle your feet

4339
02:02:01,670 --> 02:02:03,400
This a huge handicap

4340
02:02:03,900 --> 02:02:05,710
What kind of event is this getup for?

4341
02:02:05,900 --> 02:02:09,060
Graceful movement

4342
02:02:06,250 --> 02:02:08,320
Seriously, what kind of event is this getup for?

4343
02:02:08,860 --> 02:02:11,980
Hey, let's go this way.  Let's look inside again

4344
02:02:09,540 --> 02:02:10,950
My lady?

4345
02:02:12,550 --> 02:02:13,540
Can you fit in there, Hosei-san?

4346
02:02:15,300 --> 02:02:16,390
It's a perfect fit!

4347
02:02:16,390 --> 02:02:17,220
It's perfect...

4348
02:02:17,220 --> 02:02:17,980
What do you mean, "perfect"...

4349
02:02:17,990 --> 02:02:20,570
That's not a good thing though

4350
02:02:20,820 --> 02:02:21,910
Up

4351
02:02:21,910 --> 02:02:26,690
Going to inspect
the 2nd floor

4352
02:02:22,890 --> 02:02:26,140
The five of them explore the 2nd floor of the school building

4353
02:02:27,560 --> 02:02:30,200
You look really pretty from behind

4354
02:02:30,440 --> 02:02:31,830
Your gait is great, so very graceful

4355
02:02:31,830 --> 02:02:35,100
Your gait is great, so very graceful

4356
02:02:33,450 --> 02:02:34,760
Your posture was good too

4357
02:02:35,200 --> 02:02:37,040
Can you fit through here too?

4358
02:02:37,040 --> 02:02:38,040
So elegant

4359
02:02:38,040 --> 02:02:40,140
So pretty!

4360
02:02:39,020 --> 02:02:40,150
Oh my

4361
02:02:40,140 --> 02:02:41,560
That looks nice...

4362
02:02:40,350 --> 02:02:45,990
A refined, beautiful Hosei

4363
02:02:41,560 --> 02:02:43,300
It really brings out his elegance

4364
02:02:43,300 --> 02:02:44,230
Yeah

4365
02:02:45,110 --> 02:02:45,940
So nice...

4366
02:02:46,220 --> 02:02:51,380
Meanwhile, Tanaka forges ahead and inspects the second floor

4367
02:02:46,220 --> 02:02:51,420
Tanaka checks out the
second floor

4368
02:02:53,650 --> 02:02:55,220
Ah!!

4369
02:03:00,360 --> 02:03:02,960
Treasure box found

4370
02:03:01,320 --> 02:03:02,470
Could this be the key!?

4371
02:03:02,970 --> 02:03:04,670
It's a key!

4372
02:03:04,670 --> 02:03:06,130
Let's open it!

4373
02:03:10,800 --> 02:03:12,110
What is this?

4374
02:03:12,110 --> 02:03:12,900
Wildcard: Giant Elastic Snapper?

4375
02:03:12,900 --> 02:03:14,340
Wildcard: Giant Elastic Snapper?

4376
02:03:14,640 --> 02:03:15,340
Huh? What is this?

4377
02:03:15,340 --> 02:03:16,940
Huh? What is this?

4378
02:03:16,460 --> 02:03:17,430
A big elastic...

4379
02:03:18,410 --> 02:03:20,300
Wildcard: Giant Elastic Snapper

4380
02:03:20,300 --> 02:03:22,890
There's a letter...

4381
02:03:24,870 --> 02:03:29,520
Becoming a giant duster

4382
02:03:29,500 --> 02:03:35,370
The person who this

is applied to will

be punished

4383
02:03:29,520 --> 02:03:35,370
MMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMM
MMMMMMMMMMMMMMM

4384
02:03:36,460 --> 02:03:38,870
There was this thing called a Wildcard Giant Elastic Snapper...

4385
02:03:38,870 --> 02:03:40,470
Wildcard?

4386
02:03:39,740 --> 02:03:39,980
Ya

4387
02:03:40,470 --> 02:03:44,270
This wildcard will punish

4388
02:03:44,270 --> 02:03:46,920
Whoever it is applied to

4389
02:03:46,920 --> 02:03:49,110
Do it to Hamada!

4390
02:03:47,540 --> 02:03:47,910
The hell!?

4391
02:03:49,860 --> 02:03:50,410
Do it to Hamada!

4392
02:03:50,650 --> 02:03:54,260
Instantly Hamada

4393
02:03:50,870 --> 02:03:52,380
I had NO IDEA

4394
02:03:54,410 --> 02:03:58,450
I'm going to seduce Hamada like this...

4395
02:03:54,470 --> 02:03:56,070
It was instant

4396
02:03:55,380 --> 02:03:56,380
I'm going to seduce Hamada like this...

4397
02:03:56,380 --> 02:03:58,450
I'm going to seduce Hamada like this...

4398
02:03:58,450 --> 02:04:00,540
Stick it on him then

4399
02:04:00,570 --> 02:04:01,590
Then again what is Tanaka up to?

4400
02:04:01,590 --> 02:04:03,270
He hasn't come back from over there

4401
02:04:03,270 --> 02:04:05,030
Tanaka entered the broadcast room

4402
02:04:05,430 --> 02:04:09,190
Carrying out the plan

4403
02:04:05,800 --> 02:04:07,030
It was then...

4404
02:04:09,380 --> 02:04:10,390
Oh yeah, this...

4405
02:04:10,380 --> 02:04:10,660
Yeah!

4406
02:04:10,530 --> 02:04:13,070
How'd it go?

4407
02:04:13,080 --> 02:04:15,040
If you make so much noise they'll come

4408
02:04:15,040 --> 02:04:16,940
Well, how about this?

4409
02:04:17,940 --> 02:04:19,940
What's the point in asking me this?

4410
02:04:20,100 --> 02:04:25,000
Madame Hosei
seducing his target

4411
02:04:25,000 --> 02:04:25,740
This

4412
02:04:25,980 --> 02:04:27,830
You keep asking if 'this' is good enough...

4413
02:04:27,830 --> 02:04:29,860
Tanaka, this pisses me off

4414
02:04:30,720 --> 02:04:31,780
Hamada, this...

4415
02:04:31,790 --> 02:04:32,750
What?

4416
02:04:31,860 --> 02:04:32,840
Good teamwork

4417
02:04:32,750 --> 02:04:35,220
I really have no idea, if you keep moving like that...

4418
02:04:37,500 --> 02:04:38,500
Here I go!

4419
02:04:39,350 --> 02:04:39,850
HA!

4420
02:04:40,050 --> 02:04:43,420
Operation Success

4421
02:04:40,090 --> 02:04:42,420
Oh... That was kinda cute...

4422
02:04:42,870 --> 02:04:43,700
It's cute

4423
02:04:44,130 --> 02:04:46,530
Endo went down there though...

4424
02:04:45,510 --> 02:04:45,980
Yes

4425
02:04:46,460 --> 02:04:46,970
Here he is

4426
02:04:48,040 --> 02:04:49,590
There was nothing

4427
02:04:49,110 --> 02:04:52,100
Maybe we should make another round...

4428
02:04:51,510 --> 02:04:52,310
YOU!!!

4429
02:04:52,310 --> 02:04:55,140
The two celebrate
their success

4430
02:04:55,140 --> 02:04:57,820
I guess we should do a second pass...

4431
02:04:55,480 --> 02:05:23,160
Giant Elastic Snapper

4432
02:04:56,440 --> 02:04:58,330
Huh!?

4433
02:04:59,720 --> 02:05:01,860
What's going on!?

4434
02:05:00,580 --> 02:05:01,960
I really don't know...

4435
02:05:02,100 --> 02:05:03,300
They just suddenly came...

4436
02:05:03,990 --> 02:05:05,270
No no no...

4437
02:05:06,520 --> 02:05:09,530
He looked so friendly walking up to us though...

4438
02:05:13,960 --> 02:05:14,890
Watch out!

4439
02:05:21,660 --> 02:05:22,420
That's gotta hurt!

4440
02:05:27,430 --> 02:05:28,710
You're the worst

4441
02:05:30,010 --> 02:05:31,770
That's so bad

4442
02:05:30,710 --> 02:05:31,460
You okay?

4443
02:05:31,460 --> 02:05:32,460
Thank you so much

4444
02:05:33,050 --> 02:05:33,350
Good job

4445
02:05:33,350 --> 02:05:35,680
Good job

4446
02:05:37,720 --> 02:05:38,600
You're drooling!

4447
02:05:42,690 --> 02:05:44,260
Are you okay?

4448
02:05:44,260 --> 02:05:45,690
You were playing dumb just now, right, Muro?

4449
02:05:45,890 --> 02:05:47,610
No that's not true, I...

4450
02:05:47,740 --> 02:05:48,980
The two of them were...

4451
02:05:49,140 --> 02:05:50,940
Permission to speak freely? May I?

4452
02:05:50,380 --> 02:05:50,980
Yeah

4453
02:05:51,000 --> 02:05:53,500
Do you remember the weird feeling around the time...

4454
02:05:52,470 --> 02:05:52,740
Yeah

4455
02:05:53,500 --> 02:05:55,360
Ms. Marie Antoinette started dancing

4456
02:05:55,360 --> 02:05:56,570
Ms. Marie Antoinette started dancing

4457
02:05:56,570 --> 02:05:57,770
At that time Tanaka came from behind

4458
02:05:57,770 --> 02:05:59,270
At that time Tanaka came from behind

4459
02:05:59,270 --> 02:06:00,870
At that time Tanaka came from behind

4460
02:06:01,840 --> 02:06:02,600
After that I looked at your back to find

4461
02:06:02,600 --> 02:06:04,110
After that I looked at your back to find

4462
02:06:04,110 --> 02:06:04,900
After that I looked at your back to find

4463
02:06:04,900 --> 02:06:06,070
Something weird on your back...

4464
02:06:06,070 --> 02:06:07,800
What!?

4465
02:06:08,780 --> 02:06:10,890
I don't really know, but I saw that...

4466
02:06:10,890 --> 02:06:12,210
And thought something weird is up...

4467
02:06:12,210 --> 02:06:13,500
And thought something weird is up...

4468
02:06:17,820 --> 02:06:18,820
Now that you mention...

4469
02:06:18,820 --> 02:06:20,890
You slipped right past me, didn't you?

4470
02:06:21,700 --> 02:06:22,800
Why? To stick this on my back?

4471
02:06:22,800 --> 02:06:24,650
Why? To stick this on my back?

4472
02:06:25,770 --> 02:06:27,400
No

4473
02:06:28,440 --> 02:06:30,500
And what was with you jumping around earlier?

4474
02:06:30,500 --> 02:06:31,620
Constantly moving like this

4475
02:06:30,920 --> 02:06:31,750
Incredible

4476
02:06:32,210 --> 02:06:34,640
I was told by Tanaka to, "Do it"

4477
02:06:34,640 --> 02:06:36,240
I was told by Tanaka to, "Do it"

4478
02:06:44,860 --> 02:06:49,260
Backstabbing Madame Hosei

4479
02:06:49,260 --> 02:06:50,020
You guys, didn't we just say to not set each other up?

4480
02:06:50,020 --> 02:06:51,090
You guys, didn't we just say to not set each other up?

4481
02:06:51,090 --> 02:06:53,690
You guys, didn't we just say to not set each other up?

4482
02:06:58,060 --> 02:07:00,370
This year's has been pretty horrible

4483
02:06:59,080 --> 02:07:00,340
It's really bad!

4484
02:07:00,370 --> 02:07:02,340
This year is particularly bad

4485
02:07:02,600 --> 02:07:05,290
I... Found that sticker

4486
02:07:05,290 --> 02:07:06,770
I... Found that sticker

4487
02:07:06,770 --> 02:07:08,730
At that instant

4488
02:07:08,730 --> 02:07:10,910
Ms. Marie Antoinette was there too

4489
02:07:10,970 --> 02:07:12,600
Ah!! I found this sticker, what should we do?

4490
02:07:12,600 --> 02:07:13,780
Ah!! I found this sticker, what should we do?

4491
02:07:13,780 --> 02:07:15,280
Whoever it gets stuck on gets the Giant Elastic Snapper!

4492
02:07:15,280 --> 02:07:17,150
Whoever it gets stuck on gets the Giant Elastic Snapper!

4493
02:07:17,150 --> 02:07:19,950
"DO IT TO HAMADA!!" is what this person said

4494
02:07:19,940 --> 02:07:21,620
"DO IT TO HAMADA!!" is what this person said

4495
02:07:21,620 --> 02:07:23,660
Please believe me Hamada

4496
02:07:23,020 --> 02:07:24,820
He said it!

4497
02:07:23,660 --> 02:07:25,260
I'm being sincere

4498
02:07:25,260 --> 02:07:26,300
Tanaka really said it!

4499
02:07:26,300 --> 02:07:27,190
It's the truth, please believe me

4500
02:07:27,190 --> 02:07:29,610
It's the truth, please believe me

4501
02:07:29,610 --> 02:07:31,600
I would never tell a lie

4502
02:07:31,600 --> 02:07:32,820
Excuse me, can I interject?

4503
02:07:31,860 --> 02:07:32,840
Yeah...

4504
02:07:32,820 --> 02:07:34,400
Excuse me, can I interject?

4505
02:07:34,400 --> 02:07:36,540
After it was all said and done, after the rubber snapper...

4506
02:07:36,540 --> 02:07:38,380
Tanaka turned to Hosei

4507
02:07:38,460 --> 02:07:40,200
and said "Thank you very much"

4508
02:07:42,380 --> 02:07:43,460
YOOOUUUU

4509
02:07:43,460 --> 02:07:44,910
YOOOUUUU

4510
02:07:44,910 --> 02:07:46,580
Don't just be saying things willy nilly

4511
02:07:46,900 --> 02:07:49,500
Tanaka being tattled on

4512
02:07:48,010 --> 02:07:49,610
YOU, MURO

4513
02:07:50,440 --> 02:07:53,160
52 minutes since the start of the exercise

4514
02:07:54,280 --> 02:07:54,940
That's something

4515
02:07:59,260 --> 02:08:02,060
Muro hides
underneath the skirt

4516
02:08:02,300 --> 02:08:03,400
Tanaka! Tanaka!

4517
02:08:10,340 --> 02:08:11,770
You can't do that Muro!

4518
02:08:11,770 --> 02:08:12,730
That's cheating!

4519
02:08:12,260 --> 02:08:12,740
You... Can't do that

4520
02:08:12,730 --> 02:08:14,840
Totally cheating!

4521
02:08:14,060 --> 02:08:14,790
You... Can't do that

4522
02:08:15,020 --> 02:08:16,780
That's no good!

4523
02:08:16,780 --> 02:08:17,690
You can't!

4524
02:08:18,350 --> 02:08:20,610
I was just trying to... Protect Ms. Antoinette

4525
02:08:19,160 --> 02:08:20,180
No good!

4526
02:08:20,610 --> 02:08:21,480
I was just trying to... Protect Ms. Antoinette

4527
02:08:20,920 --> 02:08:21,940
You!

4528
02:08:21,940 --> 02:08:24,090
And I just happened to sit...

4529
02:08:23,770 --> 02:08:24,820
You were just about to get caught!

4530
02:08:24,480 --> 02:08:27,090
While trying to protect her, it floated up and over me

4531
02:08:27,090 --> 02:08:28,690
You're no good

4532
02:08:28,690 --> 02:08:30,250
You tried to selfishly get in there alone

4533
02:08:30,250 --> 02:08:32,520
You are just amazing

4534
02:08:31,820 --> 02:08:32,580
Hold up!

4535
02:08:32,530 --> 02:08:34,630
You normally wouldn't even think of that!

4536
02:08:35,590 --> 02:08:38,100
58 minutes since the start of the exercise

4537
02:08:39,180 --> 02:08:42,810
No matter how much they keep searching, the key won't turn up

4538
02:08:44,070 --> 02:08:45,130
Matsumoto-san

4539
02:08:44,780 --> 02:08:45,260
Yeah?

4540
02:08:46,310 --> 02:08:47,060
The key...

4541
02:08:47,740 --> 02:08:49,110
We can't find the key

4542
02:08:49,110 --> 02:08:49,450
What!?

4543
02:08:55,300 --> 02:08:55,750
Wha?

4544
02:08:55,720 --> 02:08:56,860
This is scary...

4545
02:09:01,590 --> 02:10:17,960
Egashira

4546
02:09:03,310 --> 02:09:05,700
Nooo! He's here!!!

4547
02:09:05,700 --> 02:09:06,660
This is bad!

4548
02:09:06,330 --> 02:09:07,660
From there!?

4549
02:09:07,830 --> 02:09:09,860
I didn't think of that

4550
02:09:08,630 --> 02:09:09,960
He came from there

4551
02:09:09,960 --> 02:09:12,830
You didn't think I'd come frome here!?

4552
02:09:11,990 --> 02:09:12,950
Yeah... I didn't

4553
02:09:12,970 --> 02:09:16,400
You started to relax a bit there, didn't ya?

4554
02:09:15,690 --> 02:09:17,190
Yea, uh, yes! What...

4555
02:09:19,510 --> 02:09:21,940
Now it's time for the Ega-chan Festival!

4556
02:09:21,940 --> 02:09:24,580
Here we go!

4557
02:09:25,710 --> 02:09:29,980
Ega-chan Festival begins

4558
02:09:28,940 --> 02:09:30,220
This is good

4559
02:09:30,220 --> 02:09:31,640
The Ega-chan Festival is starting...

4560
02:09:31,660 --> 02:09:32,820
What is this...

4561
02:09:37,720 --> 02:09:39,560
He was completely insane

4562
02:09:41,800 --> 02:09:42,900
He's going to lick his nose

4563
02:09:44,920 --> 02:09:48,730
The worst

4564
02:09:48,730 --> 02:09:50,280
This is the worst of them all...

4565
02:09:50,950 --> 02:09:53,720
Right? This is just awful

4566
02:09:52,170 --> 02:09:54,370
That's really long

4567
02:09:57,350 --> 02:09:58,410
That sucks

4568
02:10:04,220 --> 02:10:04,750
I don't want this, this sucks!

4569
02:10:04,750 --> 02:10:06,420
I don't want this, this sucks!

4570
02:10:06,420 --> 02:10:08,590
I'm late for work!!

4571
02:10:10,090 --> 02:10:11,830
It's open!?

4572
02:10:14,440 --> 02:10:16,420
Oh, he's off to his part-time job

4573
02:10:16,420 --> 02:10:17,960
His part time job

4574
02:10:18,060 --> 02:10:20,030
It was open!

4575
02:10:18,790 --> 02:10:19,640
It's open

4576
02:10:20,030 --> 02:10:21,900
He just opened it!

4577
02:10:21,370 --> 02:10:22,220
It was open...

4578
02:10:21,900 --> 02:10:23,540
Ega-chan opened it for you

4579
02:10:23,540 --> 02:10:25,370
Here he is

4580
02:10:24,580 --> 02:10:25,260
Hey!

4581
02:10:26,210 --> 02:10:26,970
It looks like it wasn't locked from the beginning

4582
02:10:26,970 --> 02:10:28,740
It looks like it wasn't locked from the beginning

4583
02:10:30,230 --> 02:10:32,390
If people started thinking we held him prisoner it'd be bad PR

4584
02:10:32,550 --> 02:10:33,940
He said there was no key...

4585
02:10:34,090 --> 02:10:35,650
It wasn't locked

4586
02:10:36,350 --> 02:10:38,690
Oh is that how it goes!?

4587
02:10:43,660 --> 02:10:45,510
He sure took that news well

4588
02:10:46,260 --> 02:10:49,060
He's got a grasp on it already

4589
02:10:48,230 --> 02:10:49,160
Wow

4590
02:10:49,460 --> 02:10:52,170
That really smells doesn't it?

4591
02:10:52,170 --> 02:10:54,970
I REALLY want to take a shower now

4592
02:10:55,620 --> 02:10:59,270
Safely Rescued Matsumoto

4593
02:10:55,620 --> 02:10:59,270
The dreaded training is over

4594
02:10:59,300 --> 02:11:05,410
They return to the clutches of laughing hell

4595
02:11:07,370 --> 02:11:08,630
3PM

4596
02:11:09,420 --> 02:11:11,270
They are back at the police station

4597
02:11:17,960 --> 02:11:19,330
This way everyone!!

4598
02:11:21,260 --> 02:11:22,530
Right now the movie "Police Story"

4599
02:11:22,530 --> 02:11:24,900
Right now the movie "Police Story"

4600
02:11:24,900 --> 02:11:28,070
is being shot here

4601
02:11:26,180 --> 02:11:28,180
Huh? A movie shoot!?

4602
02:11:28,070 --> 02:11:36,180
Observing a live set

4603
02:11:28,070 --> 02:11:36,180
The eagerly awaited "Police Story"

4604
02:11:28,440 --> 02:11:30,400
There's a hot star performing so they're

4605
02:11:30,400 --> 02:11:32,360
shooting in the prosecutor's dept.

4606
02:11:33,380 --> 02:11:34,570
That's pretty cool...

4607
02:11:34,570 --> 02:11:35,740
I'd like to see!

4608
02:11:36,390 --> 02:11:38,800
There are some chairs ahead, could you sit there for me?

4609
02:11:38,810 --> 02:11:46,920
New Production: "Police Story"

4610
02:11:38,810 --> 02:11:46,920
T/N: "Police Story" is a Jackie Chan movie that came out in 1985.
Also, the film crew are all speaking in Chinese.

4611
02:11:38,810 --> 02:11:46,920
The Hong Kong Film Crew

4612
02:11:38,810 --> 02:11:46,920
is on standby

4613
02:11:40,560 --> 02:11:42,580
Sure looks like it

4614
02:11:47,060 --> 02:11:49,160
Wow! Wow! Wow!

4615
02:11:49,160 --> 02:11:49,760
The Hong Kong star isn't here yet

4616
02:11:49,760 --> 02:11:53,290
The Hong Kong star isn't here yet

4617
02:11:51,090 --> 02:11:53,090
Oh he isn't here?

4618
02:11:57,470 --> 02:12:01,530
Gekidan Hitori

4619
02:11:57,470 --> 02:12:01,530
Chan・Rin・Shan

4620
02:11:58,200 --> 02:12:00,200
That's the big star
Hong Kong created

4621
02:12:01,540 --> 02:12:02,520
The Aura's changed

4622
02:12:07,360 --> 02:12:08,600
An action test is going to start soon!

4623
02:12:08,610 --> 02:12:13,980
First, an action sequence test

4624
02:12:11,740 --> 02:12:13,800
TEST

4625
02:12:13,800 --> 02:12:14,580
ACTION!!

4626
02:12:15,440 --> 02:12:16,780
That glare...

4627
02:12:20,620 --> 02:12:21,860
So cool

4628
02:12:35,440 --> 02:12:36,260
CUT!!

4629
02:12:36,040 --> 02:12:38,710
Perfect Test!!

4630
02:12:43,140 --> 02:12:47,980
New Production: "Police Story"

4631
02:12:43,140 --> 02:12:47,980
The story is channeled through the young lead actor

4632
02:12:55,960 --> 02:12:58,900
They're gonna do the real take, it'll be intense

4633
02:12:55,960 --> 02:12:59,590
Finally the

4634
02:12:55,960 --> 02:12:59,590
New Production: "Police Story"

4635
02:12:55,960 --> 02:12:59,590
nerve-wrecking real take

4636
02:13:02,430 --> 02:13:02,580
Action!!

4637
02:13:02,460 --> 02:13:02,730
Action!!

4638
02:13:02,500 --> 02:13:02,780
Action!!

4639
02:13:02,530 --> 02:13:02,880
Action!!

4640
02:13:02,630 --> 02:13:03,330
Action!!

4641
02:13:18,550 --> 02:13:20,310
It's an absolute mess!!

4642
02:13:20,650 --> 02:13:22,950
Cut...

4643
02:13:25,620 --> 02:13:30,520
Completely different action from the test

4644
02:13:37,730 --> 02:13:38,930
Cut

4645
02:13:39,200 --> 02:13:41,030
Cut

4646
02:13:41,030 --> 02:13:43,140
The director isn't looking

4647
02:13:51,280 --> 02:13:53,850
Lead Actor flees

4648
02:13:51,280 --> 02:13:53,850
New Production: "Police Story"

4649
02:13:54,180 --> 02:13:54,730
They hit him with their fists!!

4650
02:13:54,730 --> 02:13:56,080
They hit him with their fists!!

4651
02:13:59,220 --> 02:14:01,620
What do you mean we're out...?

4652
02:14:02,300 --> 02:14:03,700
They hit him with their fists

4653
02:14:03,720 --> 02:14:06,360
They smacked his face while he was facing the ground!!

4654
02:14:06,360 --> 02:14:07,060
They smacked his face while he was facing the ground!!

4655
02:14:12,870 --> 02:14:13,570
Where was the director looking?

4656
02:14:13,570 --> 02:14:14,900
Where was the director looking?

4657
02:14:16,340 --> 02:14:16,870
That's Kung Fu action for ya!

4658
02:14:16,870 --> 02:14:18,140
That's Kung Fu action for ya!

4659
02:14:18,140 --> 02:14:20,640
The lead actor yelled "CUT!!"

4660
02:14:20,770 --> 02:14:25,250
In a flash the assassins rush in to attack

4661
02:14:21,270 --> 02:14:25,250
7 hours from the start

4662
02:14:25,430 --> 02:14:33,350
After this, the return of the dreadful drawers

4663
02:14:30,300 --> 02:14:31,300
That was something

4664
02:14:31,300 --> 02:14:32,530
What an idiot

4665
02:14:35,190 --> 02:14:39,960
7 hours 15 minutes of duty at the police station

4666
02:14:37,300 --> 02:14:39,960
Just as they start to show signs of getting tired

4667
02:14:39,960 --> 02:14:42,880
They face that trap again

4668
02:14:40,190 --> 02:14:43,860
In front of training room

4669
02:14:50,900 --> 02:14:52,750
That's right...

4670
02:14:53,440 --> 02:14:57,840
The contents of all the drawers have been reset

4671
02:14:58,020 --> 02:14:59,120
This is intense!

4672
02:14:59,140 --> 02:15:00,880
This is intense...

4673
02:15:01,510 --> 02:15:02,350
Oh, really!!

4674
02:15:02,350 --> 02:15:04,520
Oh, really!!

4675
02:15:06,420 --> 02:15:07,650
Huh... Chucky fell over...

4676
02:15:07,660 --> 02:15:11,780
Huh... Chucky fell over...

4677
02:15:10,190 --> 02:15:11,780
Yeah, no kidding!

4678
02:15:10,600 --> 02:15:11,790
He looks different

4679
02:15:11,790 --> 02:15:12,790
You're right

4680
02:15:11,790 --> 02:15:16,500
The Chucky doll's posture has changed

4681
02:15:14,020 --> 02:15:17,480
No, wait, these are our desks, right?

4682
02:15:18,160 --> 02:15:19,230
Can they arbitrarily open and shut our drawers?

4683
02:15:19,230 --> 02:15:20,000
Can they arbitrarily open and shut our drawers?

4684
02:15:20,000 --> 02:15:22,000
Can they arbitrarily open and shut our drawers?

4685
02:15:22,000 --> 02:15:23,160
We're the police right? For now

4686
02:15:23,160 --> 02:15:24,720
We're the police right? For now

4687
02:15:24,740 --> 02:15:27,870
Omame Station's...

4688
02:15:31,340 --> 02:15:33,420
What should we do?

4689
02:15:34,480 --> 02:15:36,520
Y'know Hosei has been...

4690
02:15:36,520 --> 02:15:39,790
constantly playing with his cheeks...

4691
02:15:41,090 --> 02:15:43,490
This is quite serious...

4692
02:15:43,490 --> 02:15:45,090
My left jaw has been making a popping sound

4693
02:15:45,090 --> 02:15:46,560
My left jaw has been making a popping sound

4694
02:15:49,200 --> 02:15:50,160
Suddenly!?

4695
02:15:50,160 --> 02:15:52,470
It started about a month ago

4696
02:15:52,470 --> 02:15:54,930
Sounds kind of defensive, doesn't it?

4697
02:15:54,930 --> 02:15:57,170
Sounds kind of defensive, doesn't it?

4698
02:15:56,500 --> 02:16:00,100
No, no, not anything like that... Just the truth

4699
02:16:00,120 --> 02:16:01,220
Yeah, every year...

4700
02:16:05,850 --> 02:16:08,250
It makes a popping sound?

4701
02:16:07,540 --> 02:16:08,240
Yeah...

4702
02:16:08,970 --> 02:16:10,220
Wanna listen?

4703
02:16:09,840 --> 02:16:10,220
Wait...

4704
02:16:10,220 --> 02:16:11,830
Just... Ok?

4705
02:16:14,400 --> 02:16:15,820
Pop

4706
02:16:16,460 --> 02:16:17,160
Hmm... Have Hamada listen

4707
02:16:17,160 --> 02:16:19,830
Hmm... Have Hamada listen

4708
02:16:18,570 --> 02:16:19,820
Really?

4709
02:16:19,820 --> 02:16:21,260
Just tell him straight

4710
02:16:26,800 --> 02:16:28,230
Pop

4711
02:16:32,220 --> 02:16:34,740
Give me a break...

4712
02:16:41,880 --> 02:16:43,750
You heard it right?

4713
02:16:46,590 --> 02:16:47,750
There are people who can do that on command

4714
02:16:47,750 --> 02:16:50,760
There are people who can do that on command

4715
02:16:49,760 --> 02:16:51,920
It makes this sound even though I don't want it to

4716
02:16:51,920 --> 02:16:53,640
It makes this sound even though I don't want it to

4717
02:16:53,760 --> 02:16:54,590
Which is why it's Temporomandibular Joint Disorder

4718
02:16:54,590 --> 02:16:56,300
Which is why it's Temporomandibular Joint Disorder

4719
02:16:54,590 --> 02:16:58,400
T/N: Temporomandibular Joint Disorders are a pain/discomfort problem with the joint where the jaw meets the temporal bones of your skull.

4720
02:16:56,300 --> 02:16:58,400
Which is why it's Temporomandibular Joint Disorder

4721
02:16:58,400 --> 02:17:00,720
It's quite clear

4722
02:16:59,670 --> 02:17:01,500
I wonder why

4723
02:17:00,870 --> 02:17:02,850
I really think it is the result of

4724
02:17:02,850 --> 02:17:06,240
being slapped for 9 years straight

4725
02:17:06,240 --> 02:17:08,200
It's my belief the cumulative damage...

4726
02:17:06,240 --> 02:17:11,240
10 year running

4727
02:17:06,240 --> 02:17:11,240
Airport

4728
02:17:06,240 --> 02:17:11,240
Chono Slaps

4729

Defense Force

4730
02:17:06,240 --> 02:17:11,240
Detectives

Hospital

4732

Spy

4737

Teachers

4738
02:17:08,220 --> 02:17:10,710
Is that something that just shows up a month prior?

4739
02:17:11,260 --> 02:17:12,200
Here?

4740
02:17:12,200 --> 02:17:16,380
No, here. If I were hit on this side, I wouldn't think it's that disorder

4741
02:17:17,020 --> 02:17:20,100
He usually holds his hand here, and hits me here

4742
02:17:22,000 --> 02:17:23,100
I see

4743
02:17:22,960 --> 02:17:23,890
Alright, then today have him hit the opposite side

4744
02:17:23,890 --> 02:17:25,390
Alright, then today have him hit the opposite side

4745
02:17:25,630 --> 02:17:26,460
By "today" does it mean it has to be me?

4746
02:17:26,460 --> 02:17:30,060
By "today" does it mean it has to be me?

4747
02:17:34,900 --> 02:17:37,000
I'm not saying there is some conspiracy out to get me...

4748
02:17:37,000 --> 02:17:38,600
Just talking about the past

4749
02:17:39,270 --> 02:17:41,010
Then again Chono has a dominant hand, right?

4750
02:17:41,010 --> 02:17:43,080
Then again Chono has a dominant hand, right?

4751
02:17:43,240 --> 02:17:45,930
What if you just face this way and have him do it this way?

4752
02:17:47,360 --> 02:17:51,480
I, no... Can we just... Do without it?

4753
02:17:49,730 --> 02:17:51,480
I, no... Can we just... Do without it?

4754
02:17:56,620 --> 02:17:59,040
I, uh... This is not me laughing... At all

4755
02:17:59,040 --> 02:17:59,980
I, uh... This is not me laughing... At all

4756
02:17:59,990 --> 02:18:02,030
Seriously, this is me crying

4757
02:18:07,730 --> 02:18:10,720
Seriously, cut it out

4758
02:18:08,720 --> 02:18:10,720
I really am worried about you though

4759
02:18:11,100 --> 02:18:12,760
Because this is serious

4760
02:18:13,610 --> 02:18:15,540
I'm also trying to say I'm sorry to the staff

4761
02:18:15,540 --> 02:18:17,310
I'll even provide clinical records with







Temporomandibular Joint Disorder listed

4762
02:18:17,310 --> 02:18:18,210
I'll even provide clinical records with







Temporomandibular Joint Disorder listed

4763
02:18:18,210 --> 02:18:20,610
I'll even provide clinical records with







Temporomandibular Joint Disorder listed

4764
02:18:20,610 --> 02:18:23,750
You were already sent to a hospital?

4765
02:18:21,610 --> 02:18:23,750
No I haven't yet!!

4766
02:18:28,680 --> 02:18:29,940
You haven't gone to a hospital...

4767
02:18:30,020 --> 02:18:32,000
And to suggest we "pull your medical records"

4768
02:18:34,390 --> 02:18:36,830
I really hate it when this happens!!

4769
02:18:36,830 --> 02:18:37,900
Right at the very bottom of my ass

4770
02:18:37,900 --> 02:18:38,830
Right at the very bottom of my ass

4771
02:18:38,830 --> 02:18:40,830
Yep, know that feeling

4772
02:18:45,710 --> 02:18:46,540
Let's open drawers

4773
02:18:46,540 --> 02:18:48,410
Let's open drawers already!!

4774
02:18:48,540 --> 02:18:51,040
Who should we start with?

4775
02:18:51,380 --> 02:18:53,380
How about we go with Endo?

4776
02:18:52,380 --> 02:18:56,020
Endo is top batter

4777
02:18:53,520 --> 02:18:54,560
How about you go?

4778
02:18:54,620 --> 02:18:55,600
Should I go?

4779
02:18:56,020 --> 02:18:56,720
Come on love scandals, another scandal!!

4780
02:18:56,720 --> 02:18:59,190
Come on love scandals, another scandal!!

4781
02:19:00,420 --> 02:19:00,670
YEEEEEEAAAAAAAAAHHHH!!

4782
02:19:00,670 --> 02:19:02,670
YEEEEEEAAAAAAAAAHHHH!!

4783
02:19:02,760 --> 02:19:04,200
You've got to be kidding me

4784
02:19:03,390 --> 02:19:06,660
There's something there

4785
02:19:04,940 --> 02:19:06,940
No way! No way! No way!

4786
02:19:09,600 --> 02:19:11,900
This can't be happening...

4787
02:19:10,200 --> 02:19:16,070
An envelope that previously held a tabloid

4788
02:19:11,940 --> 02:19:15,020
"We know everything"

4789
02:19:13,900 --> 02:19:15,900
No no no no, hold up...

4790
02:19:19,200 --> 02:19:20,200
It's just that

4791
02:19:20,200 --> 02:19:21,960
No way, no way

4792
02:19:21,960 --> 02:19:25,340
The "We Know Everything" series...

4793
02:19:25,340 --> 02:19:27,980
Things just never go favorably for me...

4794
02:19:27,980 --> 02:19:30,100
But if the subject of interest has no dirt...

4795
02:19:30,120 --> 02:19:32,320
Yeah! Seriously!!

4796
02:19:30,730 --> 02:19:32,730
You don't have anything to worry about...

4797
02:19:33,690 --> 02:19:35,690
Why...

4798
02:19:35,790 --> 02:19:37,360
It's here!!

4799
02:19:37,360 --> 02:19:40,030
A magazine...

4800
02:19:42,860 --> 02:19:44,520
Here we go...

4801
02:19:45,160 --> 02:19:47,100
But if your mother...

4802
02:19:45,170 --> 02:19:55,100
Endo's Drawer

4803
02:19:48,900 --> 02:19:49,900
It says Friday...

4804
02:19:48,900 --> 02:19:54,340
T/N: Friday is an actual tabloid magazine publication in Japan.

4805
02:19:50,000 --> 02:19:51,200
This is Friday's publication...

4806
02:19:51,840 --> 02:19:54,340
Is this the real magazine?

4807
02:19:57,510 --> 02:19:58,880
There's a tag stuck in there...

4808
02:19:58,860 --> 02:20:00,840
This is the real thing... It isn't the usual after all...

4809
02:20:03,780 --> 02:20:22,800
Chono's heartbreak! The extinction of the slap

4810
02:20:03,780 --> 02:20:22,800
September 22nd issue

4811
02:20:06,820 --> 02:20:10,360
This is just what we were talking about

4812
02:20:08,800 --> 02:20:10,100
I read this!

4813
02:20:09,860 --> 02:20:11,100
Really?

4814
02:20:10,520 --> 02:20:11,100
Yeah!

4815
02:20:11,560 --> 02:20:15,580
Mr. Hino slapped a middle school drama kid and wondered...

4816
02:20:15,580 --> 02:20:17,080
Is this corporal punishment or...

4817
02:20:17,080 --> 02:20:20,100
Is it educational guidance or whatever, right?

4818
02:20:20,100 --> 02:20:22,100
Is it out of ignorant love or corporal punishment, and from that,

4819
02:20:22,800 --> 02:20:24,540
In the midst of all that, the great slapper Chono was taking interviews

4820
02:20:24,540 --> 02:20:26,070
In the midst of all that, the great slapper Chono was taking interviews

4821
02:20:26,070 --> 02:20:26,900
Because in terms of slaps...

4822
02:20:26,900 --> 02:20:30,440
Speaking about slaps, I read everything about this

4823
02:20:30,980 --> 02:20:31,320
Ah! It says right here!!!

4824
02:20:31,320 --> 02:20:32,910
Ah! It says right here!!!

4825
02:20:32,000 --> 02:20:32,800
Right, it says it

4826
02:20:32,500 --> 02:20:33,500
What does it say?

4827
02:20:32,910 --> 02:20:48,720
September 22nd issue

4828
02:20:34,580 --> 02:20:38,170
When we asked him about his end of the year "plans"

4829
02:20:38,170 --> 02:20:40,650
"This time the matter is drawing controversy...

4830
02:20:40,650 --> 02:20:43,720
Even if I have an offer this year, I will not slap"

4831
02:20:43,720 --> 02:20:45,780
Resulting in a rather surprising remark.

4832
02:20:48,720 --> 02:20:53,540
It seems Chono is no longer going to do any of those slaps...

4833
02:20:53,570 --> 02:21:01,040
A remark that this year there won't be any slap

4834
02:20:54,600 --> 02:20:56,700
Those kinds of things on TV

4835
02:20:56,700 --> 02:21:00,620
Making it clear that he never has resorted to violence on children

4836
02:20:59,100 --> 02:21:01,080
Ahh, I see

4837
02:21:02,340 --> 02:21:04,340
I checked this out on various media

4838
02:21:04,640 --> 02:21:06,640
That even if there was a "No Laughing" special this year...

4839
02:21:06,880 --> 02:21:08,450
They said that "There won't be any Chono this year"

4840
02:21:08,450 --> 02:21:09,750
They said that "There won't be any Chono this year"

4841
02:21:10,270 --> 02:21:11,000
This is creepy

4842
02:21:11,050 --> 02:21:15,060
We just talked about this, it's too much of a coincidence

4843
02:21:13,180 --> 02:21:14,620
Yeah, really

4844
02:21:13,940 --> 02:21:14,680
Really

4845
02:21:15,500 --> 02:21:15,840
Okay

4846
02:21:15,840 --> 02:21:16,640
Temporo?

4847
02:21:16,800 --> 02:21:17,860
Mandibular disorder

4848
02:21:17,600 --> 02:21:18,980
Mandibular disorder

4849
02:21:19,230 --> 02:21:19,860
Your medical chart?

4850
02:21:19,870 --> 02:21:21,800
I have none!!

4851
02:21:22,130 --> 02:21:24,870
I just looked it up on the internet

4852
02:21:24,660 --> 02:21:25,860
Well, let's just

4853
02:21:25,920 --> 02:21:28,100
No medical charts?

4854
02:21:26,760 --> 02:21:29,660
Well, that's it, this was my only item

4855
02:21:29,480 --> 02:21:31,940
That type of article was...

4856
02:21:31,660 --> 02:21:33,180
I told you

4857
02:21:32,820 --> 02:21:34,020
You did tell me

4858
02:21:34,020 --> 02:21:35,540
Yeah that's right, he kept saying it

4859
02:21:35,540 --> 02:21:37,920
Well, that is, really,

4860
02:21:35,800 --> 02:21:37,140
This was what it was about

4861
02:21:38,280 --> 02:21:41,400
Where a split in opinion may happen

4862
02:21:42,220 --> 02:21:45,090
That changes things

4863
02:21:42,240 --> 02:21:42,900
Right?

4864
02:21:43,620 --> 02:21:44,760
It can't be helped

4865
02:21:45,090 --> 02:21:46,320
Shall we go in order or

4866
02:21:46,320 --> 02:21:48,420
Shall I go?

4867
02:21:47,400 --> 02:21:48,440
From Hamada-san?

4868
02:21:47,980 --> 02:21:48,740
In order

4869
02:21:48,940 --> 02:21:50,360
Then Yamasaki-san

4870
02:21:50,360 --> 02:21:51,680
Shall I then?

4871
02:21:54,680 --> 02:21:55,620
There's nothing

4872
02:21:58,400 --> 02:21:59,570
Uwah!!

4873
02:21:59,570 --> 02:22:02,870
Key to No. 3

4874
02:22:00,220 --> 02:22:01,360
I was wondering about it

4875
02:22:01,360 --> 02:22:02,200
Yeah, same here

4876
02:22:02,400 --> 02:22:03,780
Number 3 wasn't open yet

4877
02:22:03,780 --> 02:22:04,960
It's right behind you

4878
02:22:07,210 --> 02:22:10,210
I had been curious about it

4879
02:22:10,300 --> 02:22:11,620
Yeah, same here

4880
02:22:14,190 --> 02:22:16,480
Would it be the same thing again?

4881
02:22:20,700 --> 02:22:21,600
That's right

4882
02:22:22,020 --> 02:22:28,260
Mysterious Confiscated Goods BOX

4883
02:22:24,420 --> 02:22:26,320
It'd be best if it was just Hamada-san

4884
02:22:26,820 --> 02:22:28,500
Well, I don't know

4885
02:22:27,540 --> 02:22:30,220
If it's the same as 1 and 2

4886
02:22:30,220 --> 02:22:32,060

Mikawa-san, acted by Korokke-san

4891
02:22:36,520 --> 02:22:36,980
It's here

4892
02:22:37,880 --> 02:22:39,580
I wonder if it's the same

4893
02:22:38,910 --> 02:22:41,910
Fu ffu...

4894
02:22:44,980 --> 02:22:47,440
This is probably like...

4895
02:22:45,820 --> 02:22:46,880
Can't be helped

4896
02:22:48,500 --> 02:22:48,820
Ow!

4897
02:22:51,280 --> 02:22:53,860
So now it's a question of what to do with it

4898
02:22:54,260 --> 02:22:57,500
You mean that Hamada-san should put it on?

4899
02:22:56,120 --> 02:22:57,740
Well, whether it can be put on or not

4900
02:22:57,740 --> 02:22:59,400
Yeah, it's the same type of thing

4901
02:22:58,520 --> 02:22:59,760
It's the same type?

4902
02:22:59,060 --> 02:23:05,530
Another DIY Impersonation Set

4903
02:22:59,580 --> 02:23:00,060
Yes

4904
02:23:00,440 --> 02:23:02,040
So, I'll just take this off

4905
02:23:02,440 --> 02:23:03,780
Your hair's a mess

4906
02:23:03,280 --> 02:23:04,600
Is this for real?

4907
02:23:05,020 --> 02:23:06,300
Of course it'd be

4908
02:23:06,480 --> 02:23:07,840
We might as well turn around

4909
02:23:07,900 --> 02:23:09,240
Tell us when you have it on

4910
02:23:08,760 --> 02:23:09,280
Yes yes

4911
02:23:12,670 --> 02:23:15,680
A switch, ah, there is heaps of them here

4912
02:23:15,220 --> 02:23:15,920
There's heaps?

4913
02:23:15,680 --> 02:23:17,110
I'm starting!!

4914
02:23:17,000 --> 02:23:18,280
Okay, we'll turn around

4915
02:23:24,420 --> 02:23:25,920
Hm!?

4916
02:23:30,100 --> 02:23:31,930
Do you know this?

4917
02:23:30,700 --> 02:23:31,160
No

Wow

4921
02:23:41,760 --> 02:23:43,000
Are you serious?

4922
02:23:44,380 --> 02:23:46,680
Why did Leader come here?

4923
02:23:44,380 --> 02:23:49,940
T/N: Suzuki Masayuki was the leader of the band, Rats & Star. Thus, he is referred to as Leader.

4924
02:23:48,860 --> 02:23:49,940
That's amazing

4925
02:23:54,260 --> 02:23:55,460
That's awesome

02:23:55,100 --> 02:23:56,880
It even comes with sunglasses

4927
02:23:59,200 --> 02:24:01,100
It was well-made

4928
02:24:03,740 --> 02:24:05,920
It's really well-made

4929
02:24:05,380 --> 02:24:07,440
Yeah

4930
02:24:09,100 --> 02:24:09,780
It's amazing

4931
02:24:09,840 --> 02:24:10,360
It's great

4932
02:24:10,220 --> 02:24:12,200
It's really well-made

4933
02:24:12,200 --> 02:24:14,670
Uwah, scary!!

4934
02:24:16,300 --> 02:24:18,510
Since he has tons of hits

4935
02:24:17,820 --> 02:24:18,920
It's a different one

4936
02:24:21,200 --> 02:24:22,940
I wasn't sure how to do it

4937
02:24:23,060 --> 02:24:24,460
It suits you

4938
02:24:25,310 --> 02:24:27,750
He does do that

4939
02:24:26,360 --> 02:24:28,040
He has the atmosphere

4940
02:24:31,140 --> 02:24:33,560
♪Wrong, wrong, that's it, it's not it♪

4941
02:24:35,980 --> 02:24:37,180
It's amazing

4942
02:24:38,030 --> 02:24:40,360
Why is your dancing perfect as well!?

4943
02:24:43,460 --> 02:24:44,980
His dancing is on point as well

4944
02:24:43,500 --> 02:24:44,640
I want one

4945
02:24:44,640 --> 02:24:47,000
I want one of those as well

4946
02:24:47,000 --> 02:24:48,680
Everything, even the clothes match

4947
02:24:48,640 --> 02:24:50,380
He even has the atmosphere down

4948
02:24:50,540 --> 02:24:53,300
But even if we do it, it's like this

4949
02:24:53,520 --> 02:24:56,400
But, it's kind of, Hamada is, a little

4950
02:24:58,250 --> 02:25:00,420
Since he is slightly smaller than the real thing

4951
02:25:00,410 --> 02:25:02,950
It's funny

4952
02:25:01,920 --> 02:25:04,980
His face is looks quite big

4953
02:25:05,380 --> 02:25:07,960
I see, this is amazing

4954
02:25:11,430 --> 02:25:12,760
Tanaka...

4955
02:25:12,860 --> 02:25:14,360
If Tanaka put it on

4956
02:25:13,330 --> 02:25:16,740
If someone of Tanaka's height tried it...

4957
02:25:15,360 --> 02:25:16,280
It'd be perfect

4958
02:25:17,060 --> 02:25:18,900
Suzuki-san... You're right

4959
02:25:18,070 --> 02:25:19,640
Come over here

4960
02:25:19,580 --> 02:25:21,500
Yeah, you're right, he is quite tall

4961
02:25:21,500 --> 02:25:23,740
You also have to dance perfectly

4962
02:25:24,080 --> 02:25:25,040
So, now here

4963
02:25:25,510 --> 02:25:27,210
There's 2 songs left

4964
02:25:28,220 --> 02:25:30,280
Ah yeah, he has tons of hit songs

4965
02:25:29,760 --> 02:25:30,280
Right

4966
02:25:33,110 --> 02:25:35,420
It's "Megumi no Hito"!!

4967
02:25:33,740 --> 02:25:34,560
This one! This one!

4968
02:25:38,420 --> 02:25:40,550
Perfect!!

4969
02:25:40,550 --> 02:25:42,280
That's what he's like

4970
02:25:43,840 --> 02:25:44,840
That's good

4971
02:25:45,720 --> 02:25:47,880
The dancing is a bit light hearted

4972
02:25:47,880 --> 02:25:50,360
Yeah, you're right

4973
02:25:59,080 --> 02:26:00,640
Ok, ok, I get it

4974
02:26:00,640 --> 02:26:01,120
Wow

4975
02:26:02,580 --> 02:26:03,960
It's a bit - ow!

4976
02:26:05,950 --> 02:26:09,250
The dancing wasn't quite there

4977
02:26:07,400 --> 02:26:09,400
Was it not good?

4978
02:26:09,020 --> 02:26:09,660
Well, but

4979
02:26:09,660 --> 02:26:10,460
That was good

4980
02:26:10,460 --> 02:26:11,020
1 more song?

4981
02:26:11,020 --> 02:26:13,760
There is 1 more song left

4982
02:26:12,640 --> 02:26:13,620
What would the song be?

4983
02:26:13,760 --> 02:26:16,500
Then, Matsumoto-san

4984
02:26:15,160 --> 02:26:16,700
Body-wise as well

4985
02:26:16,700 --> 02:26:18,560
Right, body-wise...

4986
02:26:18,200 --> 02:26:21,030
There's no way it wouldn't look right

4987
02:26:23,300 --> 02:26:25,070
You can't tell what song will come out

4988
02:26:24,340 --> 02:26:27,240
Yeah, you can't, but the only one remaining is now number 5

4989
02:26:27,870 --> 02:26:30,040
But wouldn't it be that? Probably...

4990
02:26:30,060 --> 02:26:31,640
Ahh, you're right

4991
02:26:32,680 --> 02:26:37,010
Tanaka, stay to the side there, and be the lady

4992
02:26:37,040 --> 02:26:39,900
It's the one you did, lipsynching

4993
02:26:39,760 --> 02:26:41,280
You should be the lady

4994
02:26:41,120 --> 02:26:43,650
Hamada-san's wig, put it on

4995
02:26:42,660 --> 02:26:43,320
This?

4996
02:26:44,640 --> 02:26:45,320
The lady

4997
02:26:45,580 --> 02:26:47,320
Yeah, Hamada-san's, hurry it up

4998
02:26:48,520 --> 02:26:49,140
Put it on

4999
02:26:49,280 --> 02:26:53,020
♪Eyes looking into the distance♪

5000
02:26:53,400 --> 02:26:56,660
♪The wind is reflected in them♪

5001
02:26:56,660 --> 02:26:59,080
♪There was a time like-♪

5002
02:27:00,000 --> 02:27:01,030
None of you are laughing!!

5003
02:27:01,030 --> 02:27:07,840
He somehow failed to get a guaranteed laugh

5004
02:27:09,020 --> 02:27:10,360
I wonder why

5005
02:27:09,620 --> 02:27:10,700
Sorry

5006
02:27:10,440 --> 02:27:11,840
I wonder why

5007
02:27:10,900 --> 02:27:12,580
I wonder why

5008
02:27:12,100 --> 02:27:13,060
It was funny

5009
02:27:13,800 --> 02:27:15,360
The dance was funny

5010
02:27:14,700 --> 02:27:17,020
Even though I danced

5011
02:27:20,190 --> 02:27:22,200
What's with that?

5012
02:27:23,100 --> 02:27:25,560
Is there anyone that could bomb that?

5013
02:27:27,700 --> 02:27:29,040
Well, we did watch a few times already...

5014
02:27:29,400 --> 02:27:30,260
Sorry about that

5015
02:27:30,380 --> 02:27:31,500
There's just 2 left

5016
02:27:31,500 --> 02:27:32,840
Can I go first?

5017
02:27:33,260 --> 02:27:37,500
I don't really want to be last, so could I go first?

5018
02:27:37,120 --> 02:27:37,880
It's fine

5019
02:27:37,740 --> 02:27:39,060
Let's change it up

5020
02:27:39,040 --> 02:27:40,020
Well, well, well

5021
02:27:43,240 --> 02:27:44,780
Uwah, that's kind of scary

5022
02:27:45,040 --> 02:27:45,600
What is it?

5023
02:27:47,480 --> 02:27:49,700
Uwah, this pattern is also kind of scary

5024
02:27:50,450 --> 02:27:56,860
Mysterious Brown Paper Envelope x 2

5025
02:27:53,360 --> 02:27:54,520
One moment please

5026
02:27:53,680 --> 02:27:55,800
This makes you uneasy

5027
02:27:56,860 --> 02:27:59,860
Maybe photos?

5028
02:27:58,180 --> 02:27:59,200
Photos?

5029
02:28:00,630 --> 02:28:03,030
It's kind of heavy

5030
02:28:01,700 --> 02:28:03,140
Isn't it photos?

5031
02:28:03,040 --> 02:28:03,930
It's sturdy

5032
02:28:06,700 --> 02:28:07,430
Eh!?

5033
02:28:07,480 --> 02:28:08,880
Something's written

5034
02:28:09,930 --> 02:28:17,240

Since it's by request, you must've asked them?

5043
02:28:30,700 --> 02:28:33,630
I didn't ask for anything though

5044
02:28:32,540 --> 02:28:33,520
Is that so?

5045
02:28:34,620 --> 02:28:35,160
Well, but

5046
02:28:35,440 --> 02:28:39,810
Introducing a re-marriage partner, that's not a bad thing

5047
02:28:40,040 --> 02:28:42,920
Have a look by yourself first, see what type of person it is

5048
02:28:47,440 --> 02:28:48,540

Now that we've met

5066
02:29:27,590 --> 02:29:30,290
Your desire to be married comes across

5067

Very strongly

So then, the lady actually

I didn't ask them to do this, I didn't ask

5072
02:29:43,700 --> 02:29:45,700
Well, well

5073
02:29:45,760 --> 02:29:47,020
It's not a bad thing

Exactly, it's a good thing

02:29:48,580 --> 02:29:49,880
Well, no, no, well

5076
02:29:50,040 --> 02:29:54,270
It's not like they're forcing you to get married

5077
02:29:53,340 --> 02:29:55,200
Well, that's true, but since I didn't ask

5078
02:29:55,710 --> 02:30:00,190
Tanaka-san, please take a seat here

5079
02:29:57,020 --> 02:29:57,720
Here?

5080
02:29:57,580 --> 02:29:59,720
Yes, thank you

5081
02:30:00,180 --> 02:30:02,980

5085
02:30:17,500 --> 02:30:22,340
The Mystery Woman is Becky

5086
02:30:24,560 --> 02:30:27,840
No, no, no, this is surprising

5087
02:30:25,340 --> 02:30:28,480
Isn't this a bad idea?

5088
02:30:30,200 --> 02:30:31,660
That's how it is, huh?

5089
02:30:30,960 --> 02:30:32,800
This is surprising

5090
02:30:32,620 --> 02:30:34,620
I'm Becky

5091
02:30:36,360 --> 02:30:37,120
How is it?

5092
02:30:37,120 --> 02:30:38,820
Your first impression of Tanaka-san?

5093
02:30:39,430 --> 02:30:43,600
I thought that he looks like a sincere person

5094
02:30:41,920 --> 02:30:43,520
Ah is that so? I agree

5095
02:30:43,520 --> 02:30:47,960
And then it's a case of whether your hobbies match

5096
02:30:46,960 --> 02:30:47,880
Yes, you're right

5097
02:30:48,200 --> 02:30:50,000
Tanaka-san, what is your hobby?

5098
02:30:50,000 --> 02:30:52,940
I like to watch movies

5099
02:30:53,080 --> 02:30:54,620
That's a lovely hobby

5100
02:30:54,620 --> 02:30:56,300
Do you think you could get along?

5101
02:30:55,620 --> 02:30:56,380
Yes

5102
02:30:56,180 --> 02:30:57,460
What is your hobby Becky-san?

5103
02:30:57,440 --> 02:30:58,360
Ah, lately,

5104
02:30:58,510 --> 02:31:01,510
I've been hooked on Instagram

5105
02:31:00,420 --> 02:31:04,220
By Instagram you mean the one where you upload lots of stylish photos?

5106
02:31:02,760 --> 02:31:04,280
Yes, that's the one

5107
02:31:04,280 --> 02:31:07,360
Would you not like to see it?

5108
02:31:06,480 --> 02:31:08,700
Ah, yes, that's right

5109
02:31:08,040 --> 02:31:08,680
Oh, please do

5110
02:31:08,680 --> 02:31:09,560
Is that ok?

5111
02:31:09,220 --> 02:31:10,190
Yes, then to see it easy

5112
02:31:10,190 --> 02:31:14,890
I'll connect my tablet to this monitor

5113
02:31:12,920 --> 02:31:16,160
Sorry, thank you, she's such a nice person

5114
02:31:12,940 --> 02:31:14,600
So please have a look

5115
02:31:16,360 --> 02:31:18,440
Instagram?

5116
02:31:17,640 --> 02:31:18,560
Instagram

5117
02:31:18,510 --> 02:31:20,810
Yeah, many girls are into that

5118
02:31:20,450 --> 02:31:21,710
You are really into it, right?

5119
02:31:21,130 --> 02:31:23,240
Ah, it connected

5120
02:31:23,240 --> 02:31:25,140
The images I want to show you

5121
02:31:25,140 --> 02:31:26,580
are from the birthday party of my best friend forever

5122
02:31:26,580 --> 02:31:31,120
are from the birthday party of my best friend forever

5123
02:31:28,490 --> 02:31:31,050
That's nice

5124
02:31:29,490 --> 02:31:31,050
That's pretty understandable

5125
02:31:31,120 --> 02:31:32,820
We will start off with the first one.

5126
02:31:33,550 --> 02:31:38,230
This image was taken by a friend at our designated meeting place

5127
02:31:34,150 --> 02:31:42,830
I'm heading off
to my friend's
birthday party

5130
02:31:38,230 --> 02:31:41,570
It catches me in a casual moment

5131
02:31:40,570 --> 02:31:43,800
So fashionable. Where was it taken?

5132
02:31:43,800 --> 02:31:47,670
I think it was in Shirokane

5133
02:31:43,800 --> 02:31:47,670
T/N: Shirokane is a district in Tokyo. It's one of the most wealthiest neighborhoods with very nice residential areas, making it a very desirable place to live in.

5134
02:31:45,390 --> 02:31:47,250
Just as fashionable as I had expected

5135
02:31:47,250 --> 02:31:49,030
Let me show the next image

5136
02:31:49,030 --> 02:31:50,510
About this one...

5137
02:31:50,440 --> 02:31:57,810
Parking the car
and heading to
"that place"...

5138
02:31:50,440 --> 02:31:57,810

5139
02:31:50,440 --> 02:31:57,810
Text

5140
02:31:50,510 --> 02:31:57,310
Before going to the party location, we parked the car and wanted to convey that I was heading to "that place"...

5141
02:31:56,470 --> 02:31:57,810
I see

5142
02:31:57,810 --> 02:32:01,150
"That place", where is that exactly?

5143
02:31:58,810 --> 02:32:02,630
"That place" is of course a beauty salon

5144
02:32:01,810 --> 02:32:10,870
Beauty salon!
Getting a
pre-party trim.
Maybe overdoing it!

5147
02:32:02,630 --> 02:32:07,910
I wanted a stylish hair cut for the party

5148
02:32:07,310 --> 02:32:08,430
So that's what you did

5149
02:32:08,430 --> 02:32:10,970
Okay, I will show the next image

5150
02:32:10,970 --> 02:32:12,650
This is it

5151
02:32:11,860 --> 02:32:22,770
At the gift shop,
choosing a present.
A whale shark!

5154
02:32:12,650 --> 02:32:18,390
I wanted to purchase a present for the birthday girl

5155
02:32:18,390 --> 02:32:20,390
Choosing a whale shark, I see

5156
02:32:20,390 --> 02:32:23,150
She likes these kinds of things

5157
02:32:22,170 --> 02:32:23,750
She likes them, huh?

5158
02:32:23,250 --> 02:32:26,150
These kinds of general stores are nice, don't you think?

5159
02:32:26,150 --> 02:32:27,770
Yes... What?

5160
02:32:27,770 --> 02:32:29,030
General store, is it?

5161
02:32:29,030 --> 02:32:37,080
Becky's Instagram

5162
02:32:29,030 --> 02:32:37,080
The thing that is out of place here is...

5163
02:32:30,910 --> 02:32:32,470
Wait a minute...

5164
02:32:32,690 --> 02:32:34,330
I'm fine

5165
02:32:33,990 --> 02:32:35,430
Are you okay?

5166
02:32:34,330 --> 02:32:35,430
Yes, I am sorry. I'm fine

5167
02:32:35,430 --> 02:32:36,090
What is...

5168
02:32:36,090 --> 02:32:38,090
The next image...

5169
02:32:38,090 --> 02:32:39,250
Ah, this one

5170
02:32:39,250 --> 02:32:42,890
At the parking space near the party location I met another friend by coincidence...

5171
02:32:39,450 --> 02:32:46,630
My friend's retro car!
I got permission
to take a picture
for Instagram! LOL

5174
02:32:42,890 --> 02:32:47,810
And that friend was riding a pretty retro car

5175
02:32:55,070 --> 02:32:56,900
This is Tanaka's

5176
02:32:56,900 --> 02:32:59,140
What?

5177
02:32:57,390 --> 02:32:59,140
Wait a second. Hold up

5178
02:32:59,140 --> 02:33:07,210
Becky's Instagram

5179
02:32:59,140 --> 02:33:07,210
There's something familiar about this car...

5180
02:33:02,990 --> 02:33:04,610
That...

5181
02:33:04,610 --> 02:33:07,550
I feel like I've seen this car before

5182
02:33:07,050 --> 02:33:07,590
Exactly

5183
02:33:07,550 --> 02:33:10,280
Let's look at the next image

5184
02:33:09,110 --> 02:33:10,070
Yes

5185
02:33:10,490 --> 02:33:11,550
About this...

5186
02:33:11,550 --> 02:33:14,070
Arriving at the party location. Starting off with a group shot

5187
02:33:11,750 --> 02:33:18,830
Arriving at
the party location.
My friends' bags

are totally in.

It's so lively. Nice

5191
02:33:14,830 --> 02:33:17,450
Everyone is a model, that's why

5192
02:33:20,910 --> 02:33:22,070
I don't get it. What is going on?

5193
02:33:22,070 --> 02:33:25,400
Even I don't get it

5194
02:33:23,430 --> 02:33:25,400
Hold up. What!? Wait

5195
02:33:25,400 --> 02:33:26,530
What's up with that? What's going on?

5196
02:33:26,530 --> 02:33:27,130
What's up with that? What's going on?

5197
02:33:28,510 --> 02:33:30,490
You've already arrived at the location of the party, right?

5198
02:33:30,490 --> 02:33:31,110
That's right.

5199
02:33:31,110 --> 02:33:32,350
It's really nice.

5200
02:33:32,350 --> 02:33:35,110
Aren't the sneakers that my friend is wearing cool?

5201
02:33:35,110 --> 02:33:36,280
Lemon pattern, cute!!

5202
02:33:36,280 --> 02:33:38,210
Lemon pattern, cute!!

5203
02:33:38,330 --> 02:33:39,890
Dreadful

5204
02:33:39,890 --> 02:33:43,310
Wait. What is up with this?

5205
02:33:43,310 --> 02:33:45,290
Wait. What is up with this?

5206
02:33:44,350 --> 02:33:56,560
Car

5207
02:33:44,350 --> 02:33:56,560
Sneakers

5208
02:33:44,350 --> 02:33:56,560
These are all Tanaka's possessions

5209
02:33:44,350 --> 02:33:56,560
Whale shark decoration

5210
02:33:44,890 --> 02:33:48,410
Really?

5211
02:33:46,350 --> 02:33:48,410
You've gone to great lengths

5212
02:33:48,410 --> 02:33:49,630
Scary

5213
02:33:49,630 --> 02:33:52,350
But it must have taken a lot of effort. Why?

5214
02:33:50,970 --> 02:33:52,370
Scary

5215
02:33:53,070 --> 02:33:54,370

02:34:06,750 --> 02:34:09,190
What a beautiful person

5226
02:34:09,130 --> 02:34:10,470
That's right

5227
02:34:15,460 --> 02:34:16,340
Who?

5228
02:34:16,750 --> 02:34:17,650
Who is it?

5229
02:34:17,650 --> 02:34:19,490
It's my mother

5230
02:34:19,490 --> 02:34:24,920
Becky's best friend is Tanaka's mother

5231
02:34:23,280 --> 02:34:24,810
Oh, that's right

5232
02:34:24,250 --> 02:34:25,830
My best friend forever, Akiko-chan

5233
02:34:24,250 --> 02:34:27,710
T/N: The "-chan" suffix is usually used for children or women who are close friends and close in age. In this case, it's awkward since Becky is much younger than Akiko and should be referring to her as "Akiko-san".

The 8 images shown just now

The riddle hidden in the Instagram images are?

5261
02:35:11,110 --> 02:35:12,670
There's an A behind her

5262
02:35:31,520 --> 02:35:34,290
Can I please ask you to stand up?

5263
02:35:35,790 --> 02:35:39,430
I've endured 2 kicks already

5264
02:35:41,570 --> 02:35:44,640
I've endured 2 kicks already...

5265
02:35:44,640 --> 02:35:47,690
Be careful not to hit anything when you get kicked

5266
02:35:49,040 --> 02:35:49,610
Ahhhh!!

5267
02:35:49,610 --> 02:35:50,810

Ahhhh!!

02:35:51,780 --> 02:35:54,150
I can't take it!!

5270
02:35:55,010 --> 02:35:57,220
It really does hurt... Ow

5271
02:36:00,340 --> 02:36:02,860
It hurts...

You can't convey the true pain, right?

5275
02:36:10,590 --> 02:36:13,360
Are you alright?

5276
02:36:13,360 --> 02:36:13,800
Mr. Tanaka, please have a seat here.

Yep, it's terrifying.

5282

That's true, right Becky,

5283
02:36:27,980 --> 02:36:30,180
it truly was terrible, wasn't it?

5284
02:36:30,180 --> 02:36:32,620
Yes...? It was terrible?

5285
02:36:32,620 --> 02:36:34,590
What's up with that face?

5286
02:36:34,590 --> 02:36:35,150
I did it! Lucky! Happy!

5287
02:36:35,150 --> 02:36:35,620

02:36:35,620 --> 02:36:38,390
I did it! Lucky! Happy!

5289
02:36:36,040 --> 02:36:38,390
Kind of face is what you are making

5290
02:36:38,390 --> 02:36:41,660
You are too naïve to think that.

5291
02:36:38,390 --> 02:36:41,660
💢

5292
02:36:41,290 --> 02:36:41,840
Yes?

5293
02:36:41,990 --> 02:36:49,440
From here on Becky will experience her punishment !!

5294
02:36:42,490 --> 02:36:45,030
"Yes" is not what you should be saying

5295
02:36:45,030 --> 02:36:47,630
I'm sorry. I haven't heard about...

5296
02:36:47,630 --> 02:36:49,770
What are you saying? It's not about hearing about it or not

5297
02:36:49,770 --> 02:36:50,770
Listen to your own heart

5298
02:36:50,770 --> 02:36:52,070
Listen to your own heart

5299
02:36:53,340 --> 02:36:54,540
Don't you feel a sense of doom?

5300
02:36:54,540 --> 02:36:56,310
Don't you feel a sense of doom?

5301
02:36:55,650 --> 02:36:57,310
Like: "I'm doomed"

5302
02:36:57,410 --> 02:37:00,050
Doom?

5303
02:36:58,430 --> 02:37:00,450
Don't you wish you could just get rid of it?

5304
02:37:00,450 --> 02:37:03,350
"I want to get rid of it!!"

5305
02:37:03,780 --> 02:37:07,250
Can I borrow this?

5306
02:37:05,780 --> 02:37:07,250
Yes

5307
02:37:07,250 --> 02:37:09,090
I want you to have a look at something

5308
02:37:09,090 --> 02:37:10,530
Yes

5309
02:37:10,530 --> 02:37:12,730
Can you read this for me?

5310
02:37:14,030 --> 02:37:15,160
Wait!!

5311
02:37:15,160 --> 02:37:16,800
Wait!!

5312
02:37:19,330 --> 02:37:20,970
Please read it out loud

5313
02:37:21,310 --> 02:37:23,570
Becky Thai Kick

5314
02:37:24,300 --> 02:37:24,570
What!? Hold up!!

5315
02:37:24,570 --> 02:37:25,740
What!? Hold up!!

5316
02:37:25,740 --> 02:37:26,210
Wait, I haven't heard about this!!

5317
02:37:26,210 --> 02:37:27,270
Wait, I haven't heard about this!!

5318
02:37:27,290 --> 02:37:30,510
Becky, prepare yourself. It truly hurts

5319
02:37:27,290 --> 02:37:31,810
Becky's doom purifying Thai Kick

5320
02:37:30,790 --> 02:37:32,510
Wait wait wait

5321
02:37:32,510 --> 02:37:32,840
No way!!

5322
02:37:32,840 --> 02:37:33,080
No way!!

5323
02:37:33,080 --> 02:37:33,350
No way!!

5324
02:37:33,350 --> 02:37:35,850
No waaaay!!

5325
02:37:41,490 --> 02:37:42,150
I'm already feeling purified from everything

5326
02:37:42,150 --> 02:37:43,120
I'm already feeling purified from everything

5327
02:37:43,120 --> 02:37:43,460
You aren't!!

5328
02:37:43,460 --> 02:37:43,760
You aren't!!

5329
02:37:43,760 --> 02:37:45,360
You aren't!!

5330
02:37:47,520 --> 02:37:47,930
Becky, it is best if you don't move at all!!

5331
02:37:47,930 --> 02:37:50,100
Becky, it is best if you don't move at all!!

5332
02:37:50,100 --> 02:37:54,830
I'm not gonna take the punishment

5333
02:37:54,830 --> 02:37:55,740
This kind of twist is unusual!!

5334
02:37:55,740 --> 02:37:57,040
This kind of twist is unusual!!

5335
02:38:02,860 --> 02:38:04,830
No!!

5336
02:38:08,740 --> 02:38:09,280
It hurts!!

5337
02:38:09,280 --> 02:38:10,100
This can't be good...

5338
02:38:12,080 --> 02:38:12,650
It hurts!!

5339
02:38:12,650 --> 02:38:13,540
This can't be good...

5340
02:38:17,820 --> 02:38:20,210
She fell!!

5341
02:38:18,550 --> 02:38:21,270
This is no good!!

5342
02:38:23,360 --> 02:38:25,160
Are you okay, Becky?!

5343
02:38:25,160 --> 02:38:26,870
It hurts like hell, right?

5344
02:38:25,870 --> 02:38:26,870
Hurts like hell, right?

5345
02:38:27,870 --> 02:38:29,900
You went

5346
02:38:28,520 --> 02:38:29,900
woop!!

5347
02:38:30,600 --> 02:38:33,210
You got a good one!!

5348
02:38:34,850 --> 02:38:36,510
That one was really bad

5349
02:38:37,490 --> 02:38:39,070
This time was really bad

5350
02:38:39,070 --> 02:38:41,510
How was that? How does it feel?

5351
02:38:42,010 --> 02:38:43,180
No good...

5352
02:38:43,180 --> 02:38:45,550
This one had to hurt.

5353
02:38:47,810 --> 02:38:50,890
Tanaka can't convey the pain, but now you know

5354
02:38:50,890 --> 02:38:52,290
It hurts, doesn't it?

5355
02:38:52,290 --> 02:38:54,190
It hurts!!

5356
02:38:53,650 --> 02:38:55,110
It hurts like hell, doesn't it?

5357
02:38:55,800 --> 02:38:57,660
It's a heavy feeling...

5358
02:38:57,290 --> 02:38:59,190
It will come back in waves after some time

5359
02:38:59,190 --> 02:39:01,770
No way

5360
02:39:01,770 --> 02:39:04,870
Thank you and until next time

5361
02:39:04,870 --> 02:39:06,770
What about this?

5362
02:39:06,770 --> 02:39:07,710
I'll just leave it here

5363
02:39:12,650 --> 02:39:14,310
He laughed so carelessly

5364
02:39:16,320 --> 02:39:18,220
Because you had a roaring laughter

5365
02:39:22,250 --> 02:39:23,390
I was so surprised

5366
02:39:23,560 --> 02:39:24,220
Is this the first time I've seen Tanaka's mother?

5367
02:39:24,220 --> 02:39:26,560
Is this the first time I've seen Tanaka's mother?

5368
02:39:25,890 --> 02:39:26,560
That's right

5369
02:39:26,110 --> 02:39:28,010
She doesn't usually appear

5370
02:39:28,010 --> 02:39:28,630
Your mom and my mom are both Akiko

5371
02:39:28,630 --> 02:39:30,960
Your mom and my mom are both Akiko

5372
02:39:29,530 --> 02:39:30,950
Her name

5373
02:39:30,050 --> 02:39:30,950
That's right

5374
02:39:30,950 --> 02:39:32,730
It's spelled with the kanji for "shou" part of "shouwa"

5375
02:39:30,950 --> 02:39:36,170
T/N: There are many different ways to spell names depending on the kanji. Matsumoto's mom's name is spelled as "秋子" (child of autumn), but Tanaka's mom's name is spelled "昭子" (child of the Showa era). So even though they're both "Akiko", the spelling is different.

5376
02:39:33,670 --> 02:39:34,230
Becky didn't know for real

5377
02:39:34,230 --> 02:39:36,170
Becky didn't know for real

5378
02:39:36,170 --> 02:39:37,170
That Thai Kick had to hurt

5379
02:39:37,170 --> 02:39:39,310
That Thai Kick had to hurt

5380
02:39:39,310 --> 02:39:40,870
It hit her in a strange spot

5381
02:39:42,210 --> 02:39:44,480
Tomorrow and the day after will hurt

5382
02:39:46,080 --> 02:39:46,480
That's right, Yamazaki is left

5383
02:39:46,480 --> 02:39:47,750
That's right, Yamazaki is left

5384
02:39:48,380 --> 02:39:51,080
I felt like it was finally over

5385
02:39:51,050 --> 02:39:52,810
I'm exhausted

5386
02:39:57,460 --> 02:39:59,460
Oh no!!

5387
02:40:03,300 --> 02:40:06,570
T/N: The Genie Family was an old anime from 1969-1970 about a genie who is summoned and grants wishes by sneezing. However, the wishes don't always turn out well.

5388
02:40:03,300 --> 02:40:06,570
The vase from The Genie Family

5389
02:40:03,550 --> 02:40:04,110
One

5390
02:40:04,110 --> 02:40:05,530
The Genie Family

5391
02:40:05,530 --> 02:40:06,290
Yes

5392
02:40:06,290 --> 02:40:07,910
Is it Akubi next?

5393
02:40:06,580 --> 02:40:11,570
T/N: Akubi-chan is the main character from a spin-off of that same show.

5394
02:40:09,010 --> 02:40:10,290
Pepper

5395
02:40:09,650 --> 02:40:10,290
Yes

5396
02:40:10,290 --> 02:40:11,250
There's something planned

5397
02:40:11,250 --> 02:40:13,010
Which means...

5398
02:40:13,010 --> 02:40:14,940
Twisted tissues

5399
02:40:13,610 --> 02:40:14,940
What will occur!?

5400
02:40:14,940 --> 02:40:15,670
Oh, for once...

5401
02:40:15,670 --> 02:40:16,480
It might be a good thing...

5402
02:40:16,480 --> 02:40:17,540
It might be a good thing...

5403
02:40:17,540 --> 02:40:20,280
Try to sneeze to call the genie

5404
02:40:19,250 --> 02:40:20,280
Do you even need the pepper?

5405
02:40:20,650 --> 02:40:22,920
In the manga, it was used a lot

5406
02:40:22,010 --> 02:40:22,920
Yes, yes

5407
02:40:23,830 --> 02:40:24,910
Will I sneeze?

5408
02:40:26,820 --> 02:40:27,690
Achoo!!

5409
02:40:28,390 --> 02:40:29,750
Quick

5410
02:40:29,750 --> 02:40:31,150
In no time

5411
02:40:30,720 --> 02:40:31,360
Achoo!!

5412
02:40:32,640 --> 02:40:34,160
Since you called me I will come flying

5413
02:40:34,160 --> 02:40:36,230
Ba ba ba baaaaaam

5414
02:40:36,280 --> 02:40:38,800
Hosei, for your tired body I've got some

5415
02:40:38,810 --> 02:40:40,800
Sweet

5416
02:40:40,050 --> 02:40:40,800
snacks

5417
02:40:40,830 --> 02:40:46,510
is what I will give you as a present

5418
02:40:43,730 --> 02:40:44,950
Thank you very much

5419
02:40:43,910 --> 02:40:47,310
Lucky drawer

5420
02:40:45,210 --> 02:40:47,310
Really?

5421
02:40:47,310 --> 02:40:49,710
What a lucky drawer

5422
02:40:49,710 --> 02:40:51,810
That's really good

5423
02:40:57,220 --> 02:41:04,460
A sweet present from The Genie

5424
02:41:09,850 --> 02:41:11,230
So that's how it was

5425
02:41:11,230 --> 02:41:12,590
What's up with this?

5426
02:41:12,590 --> 02:41:13,770
That was cruel

5427
02:41:15,130 --> 02:41:16,040
That was cruel

5428
02:41:16,200 --> 02:41:17,070
Such a primitive gag...

5429
02:41:17,070 --> 02:41:18,770
Such a primitive gag...

5430
02:41:19,130 --> 02:41:20,740
That...

5431
02:41:20,740 --> 02:41:21,570
Hosei, go get changed

5432
02:41:21,570 --> 02:41:24,900
Hosei, go get changed

5433
02:41:24,290 --> 02:41:24,900
Hurry up

5434
02:41:26,010 --> 02:41:27,940
It's time

5435
02:41:27,940 --> 02:41:30,780
The annual changing of clothes

5436
02:41:31,230 --> 02:41:33,140
It's that time already

5437
02:41:33,140 --> 02:41:33,810
Full on

5438
02:41:33,990 --> 02:41:36,080
When he was hit

5439
02:41:34,800 --> 02:41:36,080
It was a bit...

5440
02:41:36,080 --> 02:41:37,690
Now it's a case of what he'll come as

5441
02:41:38,220 --> 02:41:41,950
Fujiwara-san

5442
02:41:39,050 --> 02:41:39,920
Yes

5443
02:41:39,920 --> 02:41:41,950
where are we going?

5444
02:41:42,290 --> 02:41:50,500
Hosei's changing of clothes which never fails to cause chaos

5445
02:41:42,720 --> 02:41:46,070
Hosei's changing of clothes which has caused

5446
02:41:46,070 --> 02:41:48,730
turbulence so many times in the past

5447
02:41:48,730 --> 02:41:49,570
Here it is

5448
02:41:51,630 --> 02:41:53,730
Can you get changed?

5449
02:41:51,630 --> 02:41:53,730
Then

5450
02:41:53,950 --> 02:41:56,730
So it's just placed like that

5451
02:41:55,030 --> 02:41:58,270
I don't get what

5452
02:41:55,030 --> 02:41:58,270
they want from this!!

5453
02:41:58,450 --> 02:42:03,910
Of course, the other 4 are on full alert for the clothing change

5454
02:41:58,940 --> 02:42:03,610
Of course the other 4 members are already on full alert for this,

5455
02:42:03,610 --> 02:42:05,610
But there's 1 more thing

5456
02:42:04,280 --> 02:42:08,380
They should be alert for 1 more thing

5457
02:42:05,610 --> 02:42:08,380
That they should be on alert for

5458
02:42:10,180 --> 02:42:13,450
This isn't at all...

5459
02:42:13,450 --> 02:42:15,860
I don't get what it is for

5460
02:42:16,050 --> 02:42:18,890
Yeah, I don't either

5461
02:42:16,990 --> 02:42:18,890
It might be completely different from what we expect?

5462
02:42:18,890 --> 02:42:23,700
Chucky-kun doll is still a mystery

5463
02:42:18,890 --> 02:42:23,700
T/N: The "-kun" suffix is usually used for little boys.

5464
02:42:21,610 --> 02:42:23,700
But it's a little nostalgic

5465
02:42:23,830 --> 02:42:25,900
Yeah if it was that

5466
02:42:24,730 --> 02:42:25,210
Yeah

5467
02:42:25,210 --> 02:42:28,200
But it hasn't done anything yet

5468
02:42:26,600 --> 02:42:28,200
Yeah, you're right

5469
02:42:44,520 --> 02:42:49,390
Changed into Gakideka

5470
02:42:44,520 --> 02:42:49,390
T/N: He is dressed as the main character, Komawari-kun, from an old gag manga, Gakideka

5471
02:43:03,200 --> 02:43:06,100
Well, you'd laugh at that

5472
02:43:07,710 --> 02:43:10,640
Muffufufu...

5473
02:43:22,610 --> 02:43:24,360
Why is he wearing a moustache?

5474
02:43:23,120 --> 02:43:26,560
Muffufufu...

5475
02:43:28,140 --> 02:43:30,170
Stop it!

5476
02:43:30,170 --> 02:43:31,830
Stop

5477
02:43:30,400 --> 02:43:31,840
I'll end up laughing too

5478
02:43:32,630 --> 02:43:35,230
Why is he wearing a moustache?

5479
02:43:36,920 --> 02:43:38,300
Wait - Yama-san

5480
02:43:38,300 --> 02:43:39,140
You should stop tidying up in silence

5481
02:43:39,140 --> 02:43:40,340
You should stop tidying up in silence

5482
02:43:40,340 --> 02:43:42,030
With that face on, if you do chores in that detached way...

5483
02:43:42,030 --> 02:43:44,240
With that face on, if you do chores in that detached way...

5484
02:43:44,240 --> 02:43:48,350
Stop that tidying up and get Tanaka or someone to do it instead

5485
02:43:49,030 --> 02:43:51,020
That's just weird

5486
02:43:51,020 --> 02:43:53,190
I'm all done

5487
02:43:53,650 --> 02:43:54,590
What, so

5488
02:43:54,590 --> 02:43:56,460
When you changed, there was no uniform for you to wear?

5489
02:43:56,920 --> 02:43:59,490
The same one

5490
02:43:57,820 --> 02:43:59,490
There wasn't!!

5491
02:44:01,660 --> 02:44:04,560
You still have cream on your ear

5492
02:44:04,560 --> 02:44:06,170
From before?

5493
02:44:11,500 --> 02:44:13,770
Are there no tissues?

5494
02:44:21,380 --> 02:44:21,610
Muhhahha...

5495
02:44:21,610 --> 02:44:21,850
Muhhahha...

5496
02:44:21,850 --> 02:44:22,850
Muhhahha...

5497
02:44:23,380 --> 02:44:23,420
Keep it in

5498
02:44:23,420 --> 02:44:23,450
Keep it in

5499
02:44:23,450 --> 02:44:23,480
Keep it in

5500
02:44:23,480 --> 02:44:23,520
Keep it in

5501
02:44:23,520 --> 02:44:23,550
Keep it in

5502
02:44:23,550 --> 02:44:23,580
Keep it in

5503
02:44:23,580 --> 02:44:25,220
Keep it in

5504
02:44:26,380 --> 02:44:27,530
Keep it in!

5505
02:44:42,400 --> 02:44:45,140
Cocorico, do you know this?

5506
02:44:45,140 --> 02:44:48,310
Gakideka...

5507
02:44:46,410 --> 02:44:48,100
Ah, you know it

5508
02:44:46,860 --> 02:44:48,090
Yeah, I know it

5509
02:44:48,090 --> 02:44:49,710
Yeah, I know it

5510
02:44:48,390 --> 02:44:57,380
Famous for the Capital Punishment gag of Komawari-kun

5511
02:44:48,390 --> 02:44:57,380
Gakideka

5512
02:44:48,390 --> 02:44:57,380
Serialized in Weekly Shonen Champion in 1974

5513
02:44:49,720 --> 02:44:51,510
It's really

5514
02:44:50,150 --> 02:44:51,510
Actually, more so than us

5515
02:44:51,510 --> 02:44:54,230
It was your generation

5516
02:44:51,960 --> 02:44:54,230
We might have been the generation

5517
02:44:54,230 --> 02:44:55,710
Maybe

5518
02:44:54,860 --> 02:44:55,710
Of course

5519
02:44:55,710 --> 02:44:57,380
I know about Gakideka

5520
02:44:56,380 --> 02:44:57,380
I know it

5521
02:45:05,720 --> 02:45:08,160
Hey, you guys

5522
02:45:08,180 --> 02:45:12,290
Please break me out from this small cage

5523
02:45:15,020 --> 02:45:22,470
Please break me out from this small cage

5524
02:45:20,530 --> 02:45:22,470
What?

5525
02:45:35,890 --> 02:45:37,280
Uwah!

5526
02:45:38,760 --> 02:45:44,160
I was revived into this world, I am the cursed doll

5527
02:45:44,230 --> 02:45:47,500
I am Hosei

5528
02:45:47,580 --> 02:45:54,140
I will now show you hell, ahahaha...

5529
02:45:53,520 --> 02:45:55,950
This was crazy

5530
02:45:58,590 --> 02:45:59,690
Huh, why?

5531
02:45:59,690 --> 02:46:00,750
Doesn't it look like you?

5532
02:46:00,750 --> 02:46:01,680
Waitwaitwait

5533
02:46:01,680 --> 02:46:02,210
Why was I called OUT?

5534
02:46:02,210 --> 02:46:03,980
Why was I called OUT?

5535
02:46:03,980 --> 02:46:05,320
Wait, wait, why am I out?

5536
02:46:05,820 --> 02:46:07,120
Ouchhhh!!

5537
02:46:07,120 --> 02:46:08,730
Wait a sec, ouch!

5538
02:46:08,730 --> 02:46:09,120
One sec

5539
02:46:09,120 --> 02:46:09,990
Why was I OUT? I didn't laugh at all

5540
02:46:09,990 --> 02:46:11,160
Why was I OUT? I didn't laugh at all

5541
02:46:15,430 --> 02:46:18,060
I am the cursed doll

5542
02:46:18,060 --> 02:46:24,170
I am Hosei, ahhahaha...

5543
02:46:26,630 --> 02:46:28,970
Because he laughed!

5544
02:46:29,880 --> 02:46:31,400
We have to stop him

5545
02:46:30,410 --> 02:46:36,980
When Chucky-kun laughs, Hosei is OUT

5546
02:46:31,390 --> 02:46:33,190
This one was laughing

5547
02:46:35,760 --> 02:46:37,330
I got it

5548
02:46:37,850 --> 02:46:40,880
When the doll laughs, he gets hit

5549
02:46:40,000 --> 02:46:44,890
Cage Trap 1

5550
02:46:40,000 --> 02:46:44,890
There is a 4 digit code locking it

5551
02:46:40,880 --> 02:46:41,970
Wait

5552
02:46:41,970 --> 02:46:44,890
We have to open the lock

5553
02:46:43,350 --> 02:46:44,890
Here it comes again

5554
02:46:44,890 --> 02:46:45,890
It's a number, number!

5555
02:46:45,390 --> 02:46:45,890
Zap

5556
02:46:45,390 --> 02:46:45,890

It is electrically charged

5561
02:46:47,520 --> 02:46:49,080
I am the cursed doll

5562
02:46:49,080 --> 02:46:49,610
What's wrong?

5563
02:46:49,610 --> 02:46:53,040
I am Hosei!

5564
02:46:51,670 --> 02:46:53,040
What's wrong?

5565
02:46:53,650 --> 02:46:56,420
It was crazy

5566
02:46:54,390 --> 02:46:55,930
It's a proper cage

5567
02:46:55,930 --> 02:46:57,230
Electricity

5568
02:46:56,610 --> 02:46:57,230
Electricity?

5569
02:46:57,230 --> 02:46:58,000
It electrocutes?

5570
02:46:59,510 --> 02:47:00,740
I was fine just before

5571
02:47:00,960 --> 02:47:03,090
I wonder why?

5572
02:47:01,370 --> 02:47:03,090
Was it the bars?

5573
02:47:03,090 --> 02:47:04,070
This, this

5574
02:47:04,610 --> 02:47:05,690
The bars

5575
02:47:07,880 --> 02:47:09,030
The lock was okay

5576
02:47:09,030 --> 02:47:11,720
I am the cursed doll

5577
02:47:09,970 --> 02:47:10,710
Stop it!

5578
02:47:10,710 --> 02:47:11,720
Wait up

5579
02:47:11,720 --> 02:47:17,490

5585
02:47:20,190 --> 02:47:20,760

Ow, ow, ow

02:48:40,300 --> 02:48:42,310
If you want to stop me

5636
02:48:42,420 --> 02:48:46,950
The switch on my back will have to be turned off

5637
02:48:46,130 --> 02:48:46,950
On his back...

5659
02:49:21,830 --> 02:49:22,910
Let's just try everyone's

5660
02:49:23,270 --> 02:49:24,750
A little bit more

5661
02:49:24,750 --> 02:49:25,680
Though I don't think it will be anything of ours...

5662
02:49:25,680 --> 02:49:26,610
Yeah

5663
02:49:25,680 --> 02:49:27,690
Though I don't think it will be anything of ours...

5664
02:49:26,610 --> 02:49:28,650
Yeah, it doesn't seem likely

5665
02:49:31,920 --> 02:49:32,620
Stop it

5666
02:49:32,610 --> 02:49:34,960
It can't be helped

5667
02:49:35,030 --> 02:49:38,560
Let me give you a hint to the number

5668
02:49:37,720 --> 02:49:38,560
Oh!

5669
02:49:38,620 --> 02:49:40,530
The number is...

5670
02:49:40,910 --> 02:49:46,100
Hamada's cellphone number, the last 4 numbers

5671
02:49:46,310 --> 02:49:46,610
Ahahahah...

5672
02:49:46,610 --> 02:49:46,870

5673
02:49:46,870 --> 02:49:49,680
Ahahahah...

5674
02:49:47,850 --> 02:49:49,680

5675
02:49:51,080 --> 02:49:52,710
What are you laughing at?!

5676
02:49:53,780 --> 02:49:54,810
Is that so

5677
02:49:55,810 --> 02:49:55,950
Ahhhh!!

5678
02:49:55,950 --> 02:49:56,010
Ahhhh!!

5679
02:49:56,010 --> 02:49:56,080
Ahhhh!!

5680
02:49:56,080 --> 02:49:56,150

5681
02:49:56,150 --> 02:49:56,210

Ouch, ouch, ouch

5685
02:49:59,280 --> 02:50:02,290
Cooling it down might be better

5686
02:50:00,800 --> 02:50:03,260
Wait

5687
02:50:03,260 --> 02:50:04,630
Let's cool it down

5688
02:50:04,910 --> 02:50:05,930
That

5689
02:50:05,930 --> 02:50:06,810
Is there some there?

5690
02:50:06,810 --> 02:50:08,910
There is some

5691
02:50:07,330 --> 02:50:09,590
There's some ice?

5692
02:50:08,910 --> 02:50:10,130
You're better off lying down

5693
02:50:10,130 --> 02:50:11,600
Go over there

5694
02:50:11,600 --> 02:50:12,360
Hosei-san

5695
02:50:12,360 --> 02:50:13,520
I think

5696
02:50:13,520 --> 02:50:15,680
It's best if we cool it down

5697
02:50:13,950 --> 02:50:16,830
Yeah, it's...

5698
02:50:15,680 --> 02:50:16,820
Yeah

5699
02:50:16,820 --> 02:50:17,840
Let's cool it down

5700
02:50:18,150 --> 02:50:19,530
If you could lie face down

5701
02:50:18,610 --> 02:50:22,370
Has it turned bright red?

5702
02:50:19,890 --> 02:50:21,200
Yeah, it's bright red

5703
02:50:21,200 --> 02:50:23,840
Yeah, I mean

5704
02:50:21,200 --> 02:50:23,840
Yeah, this is...

5705
02:50:24,360 --> 02:50:26,350
Thanks for lying down

5706
02:50:26,350 --> 02:50:26,850
Look!

5707
02:50:28,830 --> 02:50:30,230
Look!

5708
02:50:29,110 --> 02:50:30,230

5710
02:50:35,220 --> 02:50:37,690
Ahhh!!

5711
02:50:41,230 --> 02:50:42,560
What are you laughing at?

5712
02:50:50,250 --> 02:50:51,940
What should we do about this?

5713
02:50:51,940 --> 02:50:54,640
What should we do about it?

5714
02:50:52,600 --> 02:50:54,640
What should we do?

5715
02:50:53,730 --> 02:50:54,640
What should we do?

5716
02:50:55,170 --> 02:50:57,680
It's too cold

5717
02:50:57,010 --> 02:50:59,410
But we don't have anything else

5718
02:50:57,390 --> 02:50:59,410
What should we do?

5719
02:50:59,410 --> 02:51:01,150
Do you want to try putting some lip balm on it?

5720
02:50:59,410 --> 02:51:02,110
No, no, that would be bad

5721
02:51:02,110 --> 02:51:04,520
It has that cooling stuff in it

5722
02:51:03,570 --> 02:51:04,520
Isn't that better?

5723
02:51:04,520 --> 02:51:04,950
Don't do it

5724
02:51:04,950 --> 02:51:06,150
Really don't do it!!

5725
02:51:06,150 --> 02:51:07,750
I really don't want you to do it

5726
02:51:07,750 --> 02:51:10,010
If we cover it with hand towels...

5727
02:51:09,290 --> 02:51:12,010
That could work

5728
02:51:10,640 --> 02:51:12,010

Wait a bit!!

5963
02:51:26,270 --> 02:51:27,440
Did you rub something on me?!

5964
02:51:27,770 --> 02:51:29,640
You did rub something!!

5965
02:51:29,260 --> 02:51:30,010
We did not

5966
02:51:29,640 --> 02:51:31,310
It huuuurts!!

5967
02:51:31,310 --> 02:51:33,810
I felt a  sudden sensation

5968
02:51:34,650 --> 02:51:36,310
You rubbed something on me!!

5969
02:51:36,310 --> 02:51:39,080
You did!!

5970
02:51:39,510 --> 02:51:40,490

Seriously!

5972
02:51:41,810 --> 02:51:44,540
Hey! I said that you can't do that!

5973
02:51:45,060 --> 02:51:46,240
You rubbed something on me, didn't you?!

5974
02:51:47,050 --> 02:51:49,060
No... We did not

5975
02:51:49,510 --> 02:51:50,350
No way!

5976
02:51:50,860 --> 02:51:52,900
It's stinging me , I say!!

5977
02:51:52,080 --> 02:51:53,400
We didn't, really.

5978
02:51:52,870 --> 02:51:53,880
We didn't rub anything on you

5979
02:51:53,980 --> 02:51:54,780
I didn't do it

5980
02:51:57,300 --> 02:51:58,770
See?!

5981
02:51:58,770 --> 02:52:02,110
This is why I said not to do something like that!!

5982
02:52:02,400 --> 02:52:03,060
Really?

5983
02:52:02,940 --> 02:52:03,740
Yes

5984
02:52:03,850 --> 02:52:05,370
But I thought it'd be okay...

5985
02:52:05,370 --> 02:52:08,200
Right? I thought that cooling feel would...

5986
02:52:05,580 --> 02:52:07,040
Yeah

5987
02:52:07,710 --> 02:52:09,650
Hamada-san, please

5988
02:52:09,650 --> 02:52:10,950

02:52:10,950 --> 02:52:11,820
No...

5990
02:52:11,900 --> 02:52:12,610
Please!

5991
02:52:12,620 --> 02:52:13,390
Certainly Hamada can't really say

5992
02:52:13,380 --> 02:52:15,150
Certainly Hamada can't really say

5993
02:52:14,140 --> 02:52:15,080
That's right

5994
02:52:15,150 --> 02:52:15,890
His privacy will be completely...

5995
02:52:15,890 --> 02:52:18,020
His privacy will be completely...

That's true

5997
02:52:16,790 --> 02:52:18,810
No, I mean...

5998
02:52:19,420 --> 02:52:21,930
Which is better?

02:52:22,040 --> 02:52:23,260
No, just that

6001
02:52:23,260 --> 02:52:24,860
I only need 4 numbers from you

6002
02:52:25,530 --> 02:52:27,000
Will you tell me the last 4 numbers or

6003
02:52:27,000 --> 02:52:28,200
let your junior's ass get broken? Which is better?

6004
02:52:28,200 --> 02:52:29,700
let your junior's ass get broken? Which is better?

6005
02:52:29,700 --> 02:52:31,270
Your butt will be cured by the menthol

6006
02:52:31,270 --> 02:52:33,070
Your butt will be cured by the menthol

6007
02:52:31,350 --> 02:52:32,130
Rub some menthol

6008
02:52:32,160 --> 02:52:32,740
Yeah

6009
02:52:32,310 --> 02:52:34,260
Stop that, seriously.

6010
02:52:33,750 --> 02:52:34,870
Why are you laughing?

6011
02:52:34,940 --> 02:52:36,340
I'm not laughing, am I?

6012
02:52:39,430 --> 02:52:40,410
He totally is!

6013
02:52:45,290 --> 02:52:46,130
Just casually laughing

6014
02:52:47,540 --> 02:52:49,040
Yeah...

6015
02:52:55,970 --> 02:52:59,170
Aw, they spilled it

6016
02:52:56,800 --> 02:52:58,050
This...

6017
02:52:59,630 --> 02:53:00,640
Sorry...

6018
02:52:59,950 --> 02:53:01,290
Why?

6019
02:53:01,280 --> 02:53:02,070
I'm being serious here.

6020
02:53:03,230 --> 02:53:05,670
Let Matsumoto rub more of it on you

6021
02:53:05,710 --> 02:53:06,510
Are you serious?

6022
02:53:06,570 --> 02:53:08,240
I think your ass will heal

6023
02:53:07,610 --> 02:53:09,410
You don't think so, do you?

6024
02:53:08,800 --> 02:53:09,990
Then, no

6025
02:53:10,140 --> 02:53:11,990
See, look, it'll really...

6026
02:53:11,610 --> 02:53:13,110
How about having Hamada write the 4-number code on your butt

6027
02:53:13,110 --> 02:53:14,710
How about having Hamada write the 4-number code on your butt

6028
02:53:14,360 --> 02:53:15,600
I'll write them on you

6029
02:53:14,710 --> 02:53:16,780
How about having Hamada write the 4-number code on your butt

6030
02:53:16,780 --> 02:53:18,550
Use that stinging pain to decipher the numbers

6031
02:53:18,550 --> 02:53:20,950
Use that stinging pain to decipher the numbers

6032
02:53:20,250 --> 02:53:21,340
You'll get it then

6033
02:53:20,640 --> 02:53:21,620
That's right

6034
02:53:23,020 --> 02:53:25,120
All right, I get it

6035
02:53:23,840 --> 02:53:25,220
Well, then turn around first

6036
02:53:25,260 --> 02:53:27,990
After this,

6037
02:53:25,260 --> 02:53:27,990
Hosei experiences even more hell...

6038
02:53:26,120 --> 02:53:27,580
That's a good idea

6039
02:53:28,600 --> 02:53:29,850
With that

6040
02:53:29,330 --> 02:53:30,730

How about having Hamada write the 4-number code on your butt

6044
02:53:34,400 --> 02:53:36,170
Use that stinging pain to decipher the numbers

6045
02:53:36,170 --> 02:53:38,570
Use that stinging pain to decipher the numbers

6046
02:53:36,480 --> 02:53:38,040
You can tell by writing

6047
02:53:37,850 --> 02:53:39,160
How about that?

6048
02:53:40,640 --> 02:53:42,740
All right, I get it

6049
02:53:41,440 --> 02:53:42,890
Well, then turn around first

6050
02:53:41,890 --> 02:53:43,080
Did you really get it?

6051
02:53:43,730 --> 02:53:45,150
That's a good idea

6052
02:53:44,010 --> 02:53:45,300
Did you understand?

6053
02:53:45,140 --> 02:53:48,710
Like this, people watching on TV won't know the numbers too

6054
02:53:46,720 --> 02:53:47,490
That's right

6055
02:53:47,240 --> 02:53:48,080
Yeah

6056
02:53:47,330 --> 02:53:48,920
His privacy would be protected

6057
02:53:48,500 --> 02:53:49,340
Yeah

6058
02:53:49,340 --> 02:53:50,900
Then here's the first number

6059
02:53:50,090 --> 02:53:51,030
It's his real phone number after all

6060
02:53:50,870 --> 02:53:51,430
Okay

6061
02:53:54,790 --> 02:53:57,020
Stop twitching

6062
02:53:56,120 --> 02:53:57,550
Are you able to write?

6063
02:53:58,260 --> 02:53:59,020
Your butt hair's really impressive

6064
02:53:59,020 --> 02:54:01,030
Your butt hair's really impressive

6065
02:54:06,090 --> 02:54:07,940
That's really...

6066
02:54:08,030 --> 02:54:09,330
That's really...

6067
02:54:14,870 --> 02:54:17,480
That's supposed to be a secret among us

6068
02:54:15,120 --> 02:54:16,170
Not needed

6069
02:54:17,480 --> 02:54:20,150
That's not the issue at hand here

6070
02:54:18,680 --> 02:54:19,620
That's right

6071
02:54:21,820 --> 02:54:23,140
Then, the first number...

6072
02:54:22,710 --> 02:54:23,840
Be sure to read it

6073
02:54:23,210 --> 02:54:23,910
Concentrate on that stinging pain

6074
02:54:23,910 --> 02:54:25,150
Concentrate on that stinging pain

6075
02:54:24,090 --> 02:54:24,960
Do it right!

6076
02:54:25,710 --> 02:54:26,870
I'm writing it here

6077
02:54:26,950 --> 02:54:27,580
Huh?

6078
02:54:28,600 --> 02:54:30,460
Of course

6079
02:54:32,350 --> 02:54:33,900
What are you doing...?

6080
02:54:32,740 --> 02:54:33,540
You...

6081
02:54:36,520 --> 02:54:37,470
I don't know

6082
02:54:37,670 --> 02:54:38,850
Oh, yeah

6083
02:54:38,850 --> 02:54:40,300
Ow, ow, ow!

6084
02:54:40,300 --> 02:54:42,000
Don't wipe!!

6085
02:54:42,170 --> 02:54:44,400
The numbers will disappear

6086
02:54:43,710 --> 02:54:44,920
I told you not to wipe!

6087
02:54:46,920 --> 02:54:48,920
Ow, it hurts

6088
02:54:56,070 --> 02:54:57,560
I can't take this

6089
02:54:57,520 --> 02:54:59,850
Hosei-san, those are clues

6090
02:54:58,700 --> 02:55:00,970
Yeah, that's an important clue

6091
02:55:01,160 --> 02:55:02,620
You erased it

6092
02:55:01,620 --> 02:55:04,320
Did you get it?

6093
02:55:03,000 --> 02:55:04,950
You don't understand what I wrote?

6094
02:55:05,620 --> 02:55:06,960
Just tell me whether I'm correct or not. Please.

6095
02:55:06,960 --> 02:55:08,630
Just tell me whether I'm correct or not. Please.

6096
02:55:14,000 --> 02:55:15,830
Wrong?

6097
02:55:22,090 --> 02:55:24,450
You saw me writing right?

6098
02:55:24,120 --> 02:55:26,980
Yes

6099
02:55:25,980 --> 02:55:27,830
Why was it different?

6100
02:55:26,230 --> 02:55:27,410
It was different

6101
02:55:27,930 --> 02:55:29,120
I wonder why

6102
02:55:28,130 --> 02:55:29,740
As long as he can remember the numbers

6103
02:55:31,550 --> 02:55:34,610
It hurts, so we should hurry

6104
02:55:34,050 --> 02:55:35,350
Seriously

6105
02:55:35,590 --> 02:55:37,060
Your butt's getting broken

6106
02:55:37,520 --> 02:55:39,360
Not 2?

6107
02:55:38,670 --> 02:55:40,020
Was hard to tell, right?

6108
02:55:39,470 --> 02:55:41,620
I think it seems difficult so

6109
02:55:41,630 --> 02:55:43,290
Why not use the number and rub that number of times on him?

6110
02:55:43,290 --> 02:55:44,930
Why not use the number and rub that number of times on him?

6111
02:55:44,930 --> 02:55:47,200
Why not use the number and rub that number of times on him?

6112
02:55:46,370 --> 02:55:47,350
Do it that way

6113
02:55:46,590 --> 02:55:48,060
This guy's the worst

6114
02:55:47,340 --> 02:55:48,560
I wrote the first

6115
02:55:48,190 --> 02:55:49,650
I seriously can't tell on my butt

6116
02:55:49,650 --> 02:55:50,300
I see

6117
02:55:50,630 --> 02:55:51,590
Isn't it just a number?

6118
02:55:51,590 --> 02:55:52,900
Okay, okay

6119
02:55:53,300 --> 02:55:55,110
How about you put your hands there?

6120
02:55:54,130 --> 02:55:55,370
Tap, tap, tap, tap

6121
02:55:55,300 --> 02:55:57,550
Even if you say "tap, tap," well...

6122
02:55:59,040 --> 02:55:59,680
Please say "start" and "end"

6123
02:55:59,680 --> 02:56:02,380
Please say "start" and "end"

6124
02:56:02,580 --> 02:56:03,610
Start

6125
02:56:04,220 --> 02:56:05,340
Don't write yet

6126
02:56:05,520 --> 02:56:07,120
W-wait. It's hot!

6127
02:56:07,530 --> 02:56:08,980
Wait, ow

6128
02:56:08,520 --> 02:56:09,800
What are you doing?

6129
02:56:09,590 --> 02:56:11,960
How many times was that just now?!

6130
02:56:13,590 --> 02:56:14,490
You should know though

6131
02:56:14,800 --> 02:56:16,450
Why did you write so much?!

6132
02:56:16,070 --> 02:56:18,740
You have to endure it to the end

6133
02:56:18,840 --> 02:56:19,860
All the way!

6134
02:56:18,880 --> 02:56:20,350
That was a bit much

6135
02:56:20,120 --> 02:56:21,920
You say "Just a bit more"

6136
02:56:23,610 --> 02:56:25,020
But just hold on a bit

6137
02:56:25,600 --> 02:56:27,450
Please Hosei-san, just bear it

6138
02:56:27,010 --> 02:56:27,830
Don't run

6139
02:56:27,560 --> 02:56:30,540
Then, I'll first do "tap, tap, tap"

6140
02:56:28,710 --> 02:56:29,040
Toothpick

6141
02:56:29,040 --> 02:56:29,390
Toothpick

6142
02:56:29,390 --> 02:56:29,520
Toothpick

6143
02:56:29,510 --> 02:56:29,690
Toothpick

6144
02:56:29,690 --> 02:56:30,060
Toothpick

6145
02:56:30,030 --> 02:56:31,180
He's horrid, isn't he?

6146
02:56:30,060 --> 02:56:30,260
Toothpick

6147
02:56:30,260 --> 02:56:31,450
Toothpick

6148
02:56:31,430 --> 02:56:31,630
Toothpick

6149
02:56:31,460 --> 02:56:32,490
Yeah, seriously

6150
02:56:31,590 --> 02:56:32,360
Toothpick

6151
02:56:32,360 --> 02:56:32,790
Toothpick

6152
02:56:32,730 --> 02:56:33,720
Look at how horrid he is

6153
02:56:32,790 --> 02:56:32,890
Toothpick

6154
02:56:32,880 --> 02:56:33,060
Toothpick

6155
02:56:33,040 --> 02:56:33,330
Toothpick

6156
02:56:33,330 --> 02:56:33,430
Toothpick

6157
02:56:33,410 --> 02:56:33,730
Toothpick

6158
02:56:33,710 --> 02:56:34,250
Toothpick

6159
02:56:35,810 --> 02:56:36,050
Argh ow!Hot!!

6160
02:56:36,050 --> 02:56:37,380
Argh ow! Hot!!

6161
02:56:38,450 --> 02:56:42,850
What are you doing?

6162
02:56:44,020 --> 02:56:45,430
That was so sudden

6163
02:56:49,250 --> 02:56:50,780
That was Matsumoto...

6164
02:56:50,190 --> 02:56:51,450
No, I...

6165
02:56:51,220 --> 02:56:52,470
That was evil...

6166
02:56:51,290 --> 02:56:53,070
I felt a hot sensation

6167
02:56:52,660 --> 02:56:55,330
I thought toothpicks would work too

6168
02:56:54,790 --> 02:56:55,580
Oh

6169
02:56:55,780 --> 02:56:57,570
You feel more sensitive...

6170
02:56:56,080 --> 02:56:56,740
No?

6171
02:56:57,570 --> 02:56:58,270
It's thin so you would probably feel it more accurately, won't you?

6172
02:56:58,270 --> 02:57:01,770
It's thin so you would probably feel it more accurately, won't you?

6173
02:56:59,150 --> 02:57:00,310
That's true

6174
02:57:00,210 --> 02:57:01,030
I see

6175
02:57:00,900 --> 02:57:01,740
Probably

6176
02:57:01,800 --> 02:57:03,770
I think I prefer this

6177
02:57:03,470 --> 02:57:05,370
I think that would probably remain on your butt

6178
02:57:05,480 --> 02:57:07,780
Please

6179
02:57:12,650 --> 02:57:13,960
Please do it slowly

6180
02:57:13,220 --> 02:57:13,940
Okay

6181
02:57:15,360 --> 02:57:16,820
Don't move

6182
02:57:15,950 --> 02:57:18,090
Ow! It hurts

6183
02:57:18,340 --> 02:57:20,150
Oh! I get it

6184
02:57:20,140 --> 02:57:20,850
You got it?

6185
02:57:20,870 --> 02:57:22,410
Tell me if I'm correct, please

6186
02:57:22,780 --> 02:57:23,200
Yes

6187
02:57:23,330 --> 02:57:26,770
Cleared the 1st number!!

6188
02:57:24,910 --> 02:57:25,500
You can do this!

6189
02:57:26,360 --> 02:57:26,960
Thank you

6190
02:57:26,700 --> 02:57:28,410
We just cleared a big hurdle

6191
02:57:28,000 --> 02:57:29,670
You can do this!!

6192
02:57:29,130 --> 02:57:30,340
I'm moving on to the next number

6193
02:57:30,330 --> 02:57:31,840
Ow!!

6194
02:57:31,840 --> 02:57:33,300
Sorry

6195
02:57:33,300 --> 02:57:35,970
What do you mean by "Sorry"?

6196
02:57:36,390 --> 02:57:37,570
What do you mean by "Sorry"?

6197
02:57:39,980 --> 02:57:41,650
He's farsighted due to age so...

6198
02:57:40,890 --> 02:57:42,030
But I'm so close...

6199
02:57:41,740 --> 02:57:42,890
So he didn't estimate right

6200
02:57:42,690 --> 02:57:44,140
What do you mean, "Sorry"?

6201
02:57:44,010 --> 02:57:46,070
You can't tell anymore

6202
02:57:46,180 --> 02:57:47,310
You get old and this happens

6203
02:57:46,890 --> 02:57:49,650
Should we have Tanaka do it instead?

6204
02:57:50,250 --> 02:57:51,450
It'd be better for Tanaka to do it

6205
02:57:51,720 --> 02:57:54,730
I don't know Hamada's mobile number

6206
02:57:52,330 --> 02:57:53,260
He doesn't know

6207
02:57:53,170 --> 02:57:54,630
Right, Tanaka doesn't know

6208
02:57:54,760 --> 02:57:55,750
The number...

6209
02:57:55,150 --> 02:57:56,850
The only one who knows is...

6210
02:57:56,120 --> 02:57:57,240
Hamada himself

6211
02:57:57,400 --> 02:57:58,570
Please teach us

6212
02:57:58,360 --> 02:57:59,660
That's kinda rude

6213
02:57:59,700 --> 02:58:00,390
Why?

6214
02:57:59,860 --> 02:58:00,960
How about this:

6215
02:58:00,970 --> 02:58:03,570
How about letting him insert it into your butthole and draw?

6216
02:58:03,570 --> 02:58:05,500
How about letting him insert it into your butthole and draw?

6217
02:58:05,570 --> 02:58:07,870
What do you mean put it inside?

6218
02:58:06,560 --> 02:58:08,270
Just stick it right in there

6219
02:58:08,170 --> 02:58:10,480
Definitely impossible.

6220
02:58:10,470 --> 02:58:13,210
I can't stand even cotton swabs

6221
02:58:12,460 --> 02:58:13,220
What?

6222
02:58:13,090 --> 02:58:15,160
It's painful even with cotton swabs

6223
02:58:17,200 --> 02:58:18,510
Use something else?

6224
02:58:18,450 --> 02:58:21,020
I'll put some gum syrup on this so

6225
02:58:19,910 --> 02:58:21,380
No, no, that's strange

6226
02:58:23,190 --> 02:58:25,390
I'd probably get some strange illness from it

6227
02:58:30,210 --> 02:58:31,690
It's getting weird

6228
02:58:31,620 --> 02:58:32,870
I see

6229
02:58:36,730 --> 02:58:39,570
Just 3 more numbers.

6230
02:58:38,140 --> 02:58:39,620
That's right

6231
02:58:38,570 --> 02:58:39,720
Yeah

6232
02:58:39,850 --> 02:58:40,980
You can do it

6233
02:58:39,850 --> 02:58:41,680
You cleared the first one so

6234
02:58:45,430 --> 02:58:47,530
Then, time for another number

6235
02:58:47,700 --> 02:58:49,410
We're probably running out of the thing

6236
02:58:55,020 --> 02:58:58,320
Cleared the 2nd number!!

6237
02:58:57,430 --> 02:58:58,350
Another one

6238
02:58:58,270 --> 02:58:59,320
Done with the second

6239
02:59:03,600 --> 02:59:04,700
Don't lie to me

6240
02:59:05,560 --> 02:59:05,950
Yes

6241
02:59:05,860 --> 02:59:09,370
Cleared the 3rd number!!

6242
02:59:06,220 --> 02:59:07,520
Oh nice

6243
02:59:08,690 --> 02:59:09,400
Nicely done

6244
02:59:10,560 --> 02:59:11,400
Aarrgghh!!

6245
02:59:13,400 --> 02:59:14,910
Why this though?

6246
02:59:18,180 --> 02:59:19,910
What a mean thing to do

6247
02:59:23,450 --> 02:59:24,950
I'm already tired!

6248
02:59:29,420 --> 02:59:30,370
Observe

6249
02:59:30,350 --> 02:59:31,490
Observe

6250
02:59:30,600 --> 02:59:32,810
See, he's so evil

6251
02:59:31,490 --> 02:59:32,170
Observe

6252
02:59:31,870 --> 02:59:33,070
Seriously, don't

6253
02:59:32,160 --> 02:59:34,660
Observe

6254
02:59:33,130 --> 02:59:34,990
This is really the last

6255
02:59:33,150 --> 02:59:34,180
Not sure

6256
02:59:35,040 --> 02:59:36,430
Yes, let's end this

6257
02:59:35,150 --> 02:59:36,160
Go for it!

6258
02:59:36,270 --> 02:59:38,040
I don't think he'll do it again

6259
02:59:38,540 --> 02:59:40,850
Open your legs a bit more

6260
02:59:41,040 --> 02:59:42,250
This is the last

6261
02:59:41,660 --> 02:59:42,350
The last

6262
02:59:41,850 --> 02:59:43,140
Yeah

6263
02:59:52,160 --> 02:59:53,670
I get it!

6264
02:59:58,190 --> 03:00:00,060
What are you holding?!

6265
03:00:01,150 --> 03:00:03,660
What's that?!

6266
03:00:05,120 --> 03:00:06,400
No, no...

6267
03:00:06,440 --> 03:00:08,330

6268
03:00:08,050 --> 03:00:09,050
Yeah

6269
03:00:09,160 --> 03:00:12,330
Good job finding something like that here

6270
03:00:12,270 --> 03:00:13,130
Kinda forgot about it

6271
03:00:13,260 --> 03:00:14,570
It was there

6272
03:00:14,040 --> 03:00:14,930
Yeah

6273
03:00:16,000 --> 03:00:18,400
The last one

6274
03:00:18,880 --> 03:00:19,570
We good?

6275
03:00:20,300 --> 03:00:21,110
...What?

6276
03:00:21,640 --> 03:00:22,740
How about you guess the last number on your own?

6277
03:00:22,740 --> 03:00:25,010
How about you guess the last number on your own?

6278

You've come this far

6279
03:00:26,850 --> 03:00:27,650
That's right

6280
03:00:27,220 --> 03:00:28,050
Right?

6281
03:00:27,750 --> 03:00:28,460
Yeah

6282

03:00:30,750 --> 03:00:33,180
You can do this, you can do this

6284

Yeah, really

6287
03:00:40,570 --> 03:00:43,060
I am a cursed doll

6288
03:00:43,240 --> 03:00:48,530
I'm Hosei Ahahaha...

6289
03:00:44,520 --> 03:00:45,360

6290
03:00:47,830 --> 03:00:49,520

Aaaaahhh!!

6292
03:00:58,710 --> 03:01:00,080
You stopped it

6293
03:00:59,520 --> 03:01:00,970
You opened the cage and stopped it, good job

6294
03:01:01,110 --> 03:01:01,770
You stopped it

6295
03:01:01,210 --> 03:01:02,760
You got him!

6297
03:01:08,610 --> 03:01:09,430
How scary

6298
03:01:09,890 --> 03:01:11,550
You got it, well done

6299
03:01:12,090 --> 03:01:14,290
You did well

6300
03:01:12,740 --> 03:01:13,950
You were great

6301
03:01:14,840 --> 03:01:17,290
To think this went in your anus, Yama-chan

6302
03:01:18,090 --> 03:01:19,930
Did it really go in?

6303
03:01:20,500 --> 03:01:21,130
I don't know whether it went in or not but...

6304

You're the worst

6310
03:01:55,040 --> 03:01:59,170
4:30 pm. The group waits for Hosei to return after changing

6311
03:01:55,350 --> 03:01:59,170
8.5 hours since starting police duty

6312
03:01:55,750 --> 03:01:57,230
That was the worst ending

6313
03:01:57,230 --> 03:01:57,670
Right

6314
03:02:01,540 --> 03:02:04,450

03:02:09,890 --> 03:02:10,860

Yes, it was tough

6323
03:02:24,370 --> 03:02:26,230

03:02:27,770 --> 03:02:30,910

03:02:35,540 --> 03:02:37,100
I wonder if that lead actor was alright

6330
03:02:37,100 --> 03:02:37,700
Right

6331
03:02:37,700 --> 03:02:39,550
He got completely beaten up

6332
03:02:40,380 --> 03:02:42,860
I wonder if he'll be okay this time

6333
03:02:43,900 --> 03:02:45,320
Could you sit in the same place?

6334
03:02:44,200 --> 03:02:47,020
Police station

6335
03:02:45,320 --> 03:02:47,010
Will it be okay this time?

6336
03:02:53,760 --> 03:02:56,470
It looks like they set up some wires for action

6337
03:02:56,480 --> 03:03:00,540

New movie: Police Story

6344
03:03:13,210 --> 03:03:18,490
This time he has a deliberate discussion with the director

6345
03:03:19,310 --> 03:03:20,640
They're going to do an action test

6346
03:03:21,360 --> 03:03:27,430
Rehearsal of the Wire Action Scene

6347
03:03:29,900 --> 03:03:30,530

6350
03:04:00,200 --> 03:04:06,260

That would hurt

6359
03:04:40,370 --> 03:04:40,740

6360
03:04:40,740 --> 03:04:42,970

Ow, ow, ow, ow

6366
03:04:49,030 --> 03:04:50,860

Oh, what is that?

6380
03:05:13,130 --> 03:05:14,640

To be honest, I don't get this job at all

6849
03:11:37,590 --> 03:11:41,520
I have to wear this type of outfit...

6850
03:11:39,440 --> 03:11:40,650
You're completely right

6851
03:11:40,650 --> 03:11:41,750
That

6852
03:11:41,920 --> 03:11:43,390
That Rakugo-ka imitator guy

6853
03:11:43,480 --> 03:11:47,060
From a while ago,

6854
03:11:44,130 --> 03:11:47,060
he keeps looking at me in a dirty way

6855
03:11:44,560 --> 03:11:47,060
he keeps looking at me in a dirty way

6856
03:11:47,430 --> 03:11:47,460
Hey

6857
03:11:47,460 --> 03:11:47,500
Hey

6858
03:11:47,500 --> 03:11:47,530
Hey

6859
03:11:47,530 --> 03:11:47,560

Stop that

6863
03:11:49,830 --> 03:11:51,670
lustful staring at our breasts

6864
03:11:51,690 --> 03:11:55,440
You D-list comedian!!

6865
03:12:00,720 --> 03:12:01,680
You can't look at her breasts

6866
03:12:01,680 --> 03:12:03,540
Let's stop this

6867
03:12:03,540 --> 03:12:04,150
That's rude

6868
03:12:04,150 --> 03:12:07,220
That's rude

6869
03:12:04,990 --> 03:12:07,220
Right?

6870
03:12:07,720 --> 03:12:08,820
To be honest, I really don't want to do

6871
03:12:08,820 --> 03:12:11,390
To be honest, I really don't want to do

6872
03:12:09,480 --> 03:12:11,390
this job!!

6873
03:12:11,620 --> 03:12:16,820
I am only doing this because producer Yoshinobu

6874
03:12:13,720 --> 03:12:14,760
begged me to do it, however

6875
03:12:14,760 --> 03:12:16,820
begged me to do it, however

6876
03:12:16,820 --> 03:12:18,290
when you find out more about him, it seems that he's

6877
03:12:18,290 --> 03:12:22,700
when you find out more about him, it seems that he's

6878
03:12:19,860 --> 03:12:20,700
basically a subcontractor's producer!

6879
03:12:20,700 --> 03:12:22,700
basically a subcontractor's producer!

6880
03:12:22,700 --> 03:12:23,660
If the deal was, "You do your best here, you'll be able to appear on

6881
03:12:22,700 --> 03:12:27,400
T/N: "Dancing Sanma Palace" is a variety show hosted by famous Japanese comedian, Sanma.

6882
03:12:23,660 --> 03:12:27,400
If the deal was, "You do your best here, you'll be able to appear on

6883
03:12:24,400 --> 03:12:27,400
'Dancing Sanma Palace' again," then sure, I'll do it

6884
03:12:26,740 --> 03:12:27,400
That guy

6885
03:12:27,800 --> 03:12:32,640
seems to work on

6886
03:12:28,370 --> 03:12:32,640
nothing but Gaki Tsukai!!

6887
03:12:30,980 --> 03:12:31,700
And he dares

6888
03:12:31,700 --> 03:12:33,460
to offer me this job

6889
03:12:33,460 --> 03:12:34,460
Is that so?

6890
03:12:35,510 --> 03:12:38,310
He really doesn't work on anything else

6891
03:12:36,720 --> 03:12:38,310
Is that so?

6892
03:12:38,310 --> 03:12:40,120
Yoshinobu is like that?

6893
03:12:38,970 --> 03:12:41,520
Yeah, seriously

6894
03:12:40,110 --> 03:12:41,520
Yep, that's Yoshinobu

6895
03:12:44,250 --> 03:12:45,650
It might not look like it

6896
03:12:46,020 --> 03:12:48,620
He's the president, right?

6897
03:12:47,300 --> 03:12:48,620
Yeah, Yoshinobu-san...

6898
03:12:48,920 --> 03:12:49,460
However

6899
03:12:49,460 --> 03:12:54,160

6900
03:12:51,060 --> 03:12:52,760
pushes through until the end?

6901
03:12:52,760 --> 03:12:54,160
pushes through until the end?

6902

03:14:35,960 --> 03:14:39,400
5:30 PM

7226
03:14:36,190 --> 03:14:39,410
And now, police-appropriate work

7227
03:14:36,190 --> 03:14:39,410
Working for 9 hours 30 minutes at the police station

7228
03:14:42,720 --> 03:14:44,570
Listen up, guys

7229
03:14:44,740 --> 03:14:50,010
Unlike you lenient old guys

7230
03:14:47,310 --> 03:14:50,010
a first rank police officer will conduct an investigation

7231
03:14:50,280 --> 03:14:52,110
Let's go observe!!

7232
03:14:52,890 --> 03:14:54,660
First rank police officer??

7233
03:14:53,950 --> 03:14:59,320
A demonstration by a former pro

7234
03:14:53,950 --> 03:14:59,320
An observation of an investigation done by a first rank police officer!!

7235
03:14:54,990 --> 03:14:57,150
I kinda want to see that

7236
03:14:57,150 --> 03:14:59,320
Ahhh my body feels heavy

7237
03:14:59,840 --> 03:15:07,600
Interrogation room

7238
03:15:00,680 --> 03:15:02,010
Enter

7239
03:15:03,460 --> 03:15:05,530
Line up as usual

7240
03:15:06,560 --> 03:15:07,600
So spacious

7241
03:15:10,110 --> 03:15:11,530
Over here

7242
03:15:11,530 --> 03:15:16,110
is the master investigator who will use whatever

7243
03:15:13,600 --> 03:15:16,110
means necessary to get a confession

7244
03:15:16,570 --> 03:15:20,840
Pay close attention to the tour

7245
03:15:18,410 --> 03:15:20,840
Alright

7246
03:15:18,870 --> 03:15:20,840
Interrogator, eh

7247
03:15:23,080 --> 03:15:26,150
Crack detective

7248
03:15:23,080 --> 03:15:26,150
Kendo Kobayashi

7249
03:15:26,950 --> 03:15:28,950
Bring in the suspect

7250
03:15:28,390 --> 03:15:28,950
Yes sir

7251
03:15:30,320 --> 03:15:31,320
What a pain

7252
03:15:31,820 --> 03:15:34,220
How long until that guy starts talking

7253
03:15:34,220 --> 03:15:36,760
Today I'll make him spit it out!!

7254
03:15:36,760 --> 03:15:38,800
I have brought him

7255
03:15:37,530 --> 03:15:38,800
Come in already

7256
03:15:38,800 --> 03:15:39,260
Get in

7257
03:15:39,560 --> 03:15:42,560
Hakamada Yoshihiko

7258
03:15:39,560 --> 03:15:42,560
Suspect

7259
03:15:43,230 --> 03:15:44,600
There you are

7260
03:15:46,620 --> 03:15:47,770
Hey

7261
03:15:48,440 --> 03:15:50,840
Do you know what you've done?

7262
03:15:50,840 --> 03:15:50,920
Spit it out already!!

7263
03:15:50,920 --> 03:15:50,960
Spit it out already!!

7264
03:15:50,960 --> 03:15:51,020
Spit it out already!!

7265
03:15:51,020 --> 03:15:51,090
Spit it out already!!

7266
03:15:51,090 --> 03:15:51,170
Spit it out already!!

7267
03:15:51,170 --> 03:15:52,810
Spit it out already!!

7268
03:15:54,310 --> 03:15:56,640
I had an affair

7269
03:15:56,640 --> 03:15:58,480
It wasn't just an affair!!

7270
03:15:58,680 --> 03:16:00,050
Say it properly!!

7271
03:16:01,250 --> 03:16:04,990
It was an APA Affair

7272
03:16:01,250 --> 03:16:04,990
T/N: "APA Affair" refers to this actor Hakamada Yoshihiko's real life affair with a gravure idol at one of the APA Hotel locations.

7273
03:16:06,890 --> 03:16:07,590
Oh man

7274
03:16:07,690 --> 03:16:10,260
Now that I think about it, why the hell would you say that?

7275
03:16:08,260 --> 03:16:10,260
There is no such word!

7276
03:16:10,260 --> 03:16:16,260
The investigation of the APA Affair

7277
03:16:12,230 --> 03:16:14,530
There is no such word

7278
03:16:14,910 --> 03:16:16,260
While being

7279
03:16:16,580 --> 03:16:18,470
tired and drunk

7280
03:16:18,750 --> 03:16:29,740
While being drunk and tired what kind of favor did you ask the woman?

7281
03:16:18,790 --> 03:16:20,340
it seems you asked

7282
03:16:20,340 --> 03:16:22,040
the woman for a favor

7283
03:16:22,310 --> 03:16:24,470
What kind of favor was it?

7284
03:16:26,020 --> 03:16:29,740
To make a reservation at the APA Hotel

7285
03:16:32,010 --> 03:16:33,040
Reservation at the APA Hotel??

7286
03:16:33,040 --> 03:16:35,280
Are you an idiot?

7287
03:16:38,820 --> 03:16:41,590
It's not a crime though

7288
03:16:40,000 --> 03:16:41,590
That's right

7289
03:16:42,760 --> 03:16:43,760
Don't move!!

7290
03:16:44,090 --> 03:16:49,200
A prisoner has taken the detective hostage

7291
03:16:45,280 --> 03:16:46,730
Let me out of this prison!!

7292
03:16:46,730 --> 03:16:47,760
Shit

7293
03:16:47,760 --> 03:16:49,200
How did you get here?

7294
03:16:49,780 --> 03:16:51,670
Wait!!

7295
03:16:54,240 --> 03:16:56,370
Who the hell are you?!

7296
03:16:56,500 --> 03:16:57,460
Villanous bastards like you

7297
03:16:56,640 --> 03:17:05,810
Harada Ryuji

7298
03:16:57,460 --> 03:16:59,080
ought to be crushed

7299
03:16:59,370 --> 03:17:01,520
This year

7300
03:17:00,160 --> 03:17:01,520
I come here naked!!

7301
03:17:01,660 --> 03:17:05,810
Hentai Kamen Harada

7302
03:17:01,660 --> 03:17:05,810
T/N: "Kamen" means masked. It's a word used often for masked heroes, like Kamen Rider. "Hentai" means someone who is a pervert. Thus, his name is "Masked Pervert".

7303
03:17:02,460 --> 03:17:03,740
Hentai Kamen

7304
03:17:03,200 --> 03:17:04,280
He's still doing it

7305
03:17:03,740 --> 03:17:05,820
Harada

7306
03:17:04,210 --> 03:17:05,110
Hentai Kamen Harada

7307
03:17:06,150 --> 03:17:11,150
Hentai Kamen appears during a predicament

7308
03:17:12,580 --> 03:17:15,290
Why do this?

7309
03:17:14,340 --> 03:17:15,290
Amazing, right?

7310
03:17:15,290 --> 03:17:17,890
What an amazing development

7311
03:17:19,500 --> 03:17:20,280
Well, this is a co-starring dream

7312
03:17:20,280 --> 03:17:20,410
Co-starring dream

7313
03:17:20,410 --> 03:17:22,200
Co-starring dream

7314
03:17:22,200 --> 03:17:24,330
What's with this guy??

7315
03:17:22,530 --> 03:17:27,070
Hentai Kamen starts to control the situation

7316
03:17:27,470 --> 03:17:28,640
This guy is a real pervert!!

7317
03:17:28,640 --> 03:17:30,400
This guy is a real pervert!!

7318
03:17:35,150 --> 03:17:38,220
What kind of setting is this?

7319
03:17:35,150 --> 03:17:38,340
T/N: The kanji on the underwear is "Hara" from "Harada"

7320
03:17:41,650 --> 03:17:43,380
I'll shoot!!

7321
03:17:43,380 --> 03:17:45,820
Don't worry about me!!

7322
03:17:44,520 --> 03:17:45,820
Just catch this guy!!

7323
03:17:47,050 --> 03:17:47,740
Ahhh!!

7324
03:17:48,020 --> 03:17:55,330
Hentai Kamen has been shot and now is in trouble

7325
03:17:51,800 --> 03:17:53,200
It seems I've been shot in the arm

7326
03:17:54,100 --> 03:17:55,340
Shit

7327
03:17:55,610 --> 03:18:00,570
If only I had another person to assist me...

7328
03:17:56,630 --> 03:18:00,570
If only I had another person to assist me...

7329
03:18:03,940 --> 03:18:06,140
You're joking, right?

7330
03:18:04,890 --> 03:18:06,140
If only

7331
03:18:06,140 --> 03:18:09,240
there was a second super pervert...

7332
03:18:06,140 --> 03:18:09,240
Underwear

7333
03:18:11,150 --> 03:18:12,950
Hakamada

7334
03:18:12,960 --> 03:18:13,130
Goooo!!!!

7335
03:18:13,130 --> 03:18:13,200
Goooo!!!!

7336
03:18:13,200 --> 03:18:13,260
Goooo!!!!

7337
03:18:13,260 --> 03:18:13,330
Goooo!!!!

7338
03:18:13,330 --> 03:18:13,400
Goooo!!!!

7339
03:18:13,400 --> 03:18:14,480
Goooo!!!!

7340
03:18:14,880 --> 03:18:17,330
What a great voice

7341
03:18:17,340 --> 03:18:18,630
Really great voice

7342
03:18:19,120 --> 03:18:22,190
Are you serious!?

7343
03:18:22,610 --> 03:18:27,660
Ecstasyyyyyyyyyyyyyyy!!

7344
03:18:30,250 --> 03:18:31,820
FOOOOOOOOOOOHHHHHHHHHH!!!!!

7345
03:18:31,820 --> 03:18:31,920
FOOOOOOOOOOOHHHHHHHHHH!!!!!

7346
03:18:31,920 --> 03:18:32,020
FOOOOOOOOOOOHHHHHHHHHH!!!!!

7347
03:18:32,020 --> 03:18:32,120
FOOOOOOOOOOOHHHHHHHHHH!!!!!

7348
03:18:32,120 --> 03:18:32,220
FOOOOOOOOOOOHHHHHHHHHH!!!!!

7349
03:18:32,220 --> 03:18:32,320
FOOOOOOOOOOOHHHHHHHHHH!!!!!

7350
03:18:32,320 --> 03:18:34,340
FOOOOOOOOOOOHHHHHHHHHH!!!!!

7351
03:18:34,340 --> 03:18:35,800
What are you!?

7352
03:18:35,800 --> 03:18:36,870
This guy's an idiot

7353
03:18:36,990 --> 03:18:41,480
Several times a month I would have an affair at the hotel,

7354
03:18:36,990 --> 03:18:41,480
T/N: The kanji on the underwear says "Haka" from "Hakamada"

7355
03:18:39,120 --> 03:18:41,480
I'd walk out while collecting hotel points

7356
03:18:41,480 --> 03:18:43,510
and was sold out by the partner who I was cheating with

7357
03:18:43,660 --> 03:18:45,550
That was outmost sloppiness

7358
03:18:45,550 --> 03:18:47,040
Affair Kamen

7359
03:18:45,700 --> 03:18:50,580
Affair Kamen Hakamada

7360
03:18:47,040 --> 03:18:48,320
Hakamada

7361
03:18:48,410 --> 03:18:49,230
Affair Kamen Hakamada

7362
03:18:50,580 --> 03:18:55,490
He's an idiot

7363
03:18:52,240 --> 03:18:55,180
I'm done, I'm done with this

7364
03:18:52,680 --> 03:18:55,490
It's all being handled now

7365
03:18:53,350 --> 03:18:58,290
Affair Purification: Affair Kamen has arrived

7366
03:18:58,290 --> 03:19:01,030
Maybe he's trying to start over on a clean slate

7367
03:18:58,290 --> 03:19:01,030
Maybe this is helping him feel better about it

7368
03:19:01,030 --> 03:19:02,660
That was refreshing

7369
03:19:02,660 --> 03:19:03,960
Affair Kamen, good of you to break free

7370
03:19:03,960 --> 03:19:06,830
Affair Kamen, good of you to break free

7371
03:19:05,310 --> 03:19:05,800
Yes

7372
03:19:05,800 --> 03:19:06,840
Good

7373
03:19:07,170 --> 03:19:09,740
Flesh-colored underwear

7374
03:19:07,880 --> 03:19:09,740
Why are you wearing underwear?

7375
03:19:09,740 --> 03:19:12,140
Don't underestimate nudity, you bastard

7376
03:19:11,010 --> 03:19:12,140
Don't underestimate nudity,  you bastard

7377
03:19:23,580 --> 03:19:24,590
Amazing

7378
03:19:27,880 --> 03:19:30,290
He really did it

7379
03:19:28,820 --> 03:19:30,290
It's comfortable being naked, right?

7380
03:19:30,290 --> 03:19:31,290
It's comfortable being naked, right?

7381
03:19:31,340 --> 03:19:31,430
ffu-

7382
03:19:31,430 --> 03:19:31,610
ffu-

7383
03:19:31,510 --> 03:19:31,610

03:19:31,610 --> 03:19:31,760
FOOOOOOOHHHHH!!

7385
03:19:31,610 --> 03:19:31,770
ffu-

7386
03:19:31,770 --> 03:19:32,680
ffu-FOOOOOOOHHHHH!!

7387
03:19:32,680 --> 03:19:32,780
ffu-

7388
03:19:32,680 --> 03:19:32,810
FOOOOOOOHHHHH!!

7389
03:19:32,780 --> 03:19:32,880
ffu-

7390
03:19:32,810 --> 03:19:32,910
FOOOOOOOHHHHH!!

7391
03:19:32,880 --> 03:19:32,990
ffu-

7392
03:19:32,910 --> 03:19:32,990
FOOOOOOOHHHHH!!

7393
03:19:32,990 --> 03:19:33,380
ffu-

7394
03:19:32,990 --> 03:19:33,490
FOOOOOOOHHHHH!!

7395
03:19:33,380 --> 03:19:33,490
ffu-

7396
03:19:33,490 --> 03:19:34,330
ffu-FOOOOOOOHHHHH!!

7397
03:19:36,400 --> 03:19:38,300
Hentai power charging is now complete

7398
03:19:38,750 --> 03:19:38,980
Achaaaaaaaa~!!

7399
03:19:38,980 --> 03:19:40,500
Achaaaaaaaaa~!!

7400
03:19:39,750 --> 03:19:40,500
Alright!

7401
03:19:46,870 --> 03:19:50,240
What is this even?

7402
03:19:47,510 --> 03:19:50,240
It looks like Lytton Commission

7403
03:19:47,510 --> 03:19:50,240
T/N: Lytton Commission is a Japanese comedian duo.

7404
03:19:52,620 --> 03:19:54,540
What the hell is this??

7405
03:19:52,790 --> 03:19:55,980
But even Lytton wouldn't go this far...

7406
03:19:55,380 --> 03:19:55,920
Alright, let's defeat this guy!!

7407
03:19:55,920 --> 03:19:56,980
Alright, let's defeat this guy!!

7408
03:19:57,420 --> 03:19:58,620
Transformation!

7409
03:19:57,420 --> 03:20:00,060
T/N: "Hentai" can also mean transformation.

7410
03:19:57,420 --> 03:20:03,320
Finally, a counterattack

7411
03:20:00,060 --> 03:20:01,190
TRANSFORM!!

7412
03:20:01,190 --> 03:20:02,220
TRANSFORM!!

7413
03:20:03,670 --> 03:20:08,260
Affair secret technique: Golden Power Beam!!

7414
03:20:05,120 --> 03:20:08,260
Golden Power

7415
03:20:06,040 --> 03:20:06,240
Beam!!

7416
03:20:06,240 --> 03:20:08,260
Beam!!

7417
03:20:09,540 --> 03:20:11,070
We didn't even see these special effects

7418
03:20:11,750 --> 03:20:11,910
ATAAA!!

7419
03:20:11,910 --> 03:20:13,050
ATAAA!!

7420
03:20:16,200 --> 03:20:22,680
Prisoner has been magnificently punished

7421
03:20:18,030 --> 03:20:19,910
Good job, Affair Kamen

7422
03:20:19,310 --> 03:20:19,910
Yes

7423
03:20:23,440 --> 03:20:25,480
Hentai Kamen

7424
03:20:24,450 --> 03:20:25,480
Affair Kamen

7425
03:20:25,480 --> 03:20:28,880
Clothes, ideals,

7426
03:20:26,300 --> 03:20:28,880
shame

7427
03:20:27,050 --> 03:20:28,880
Favorable impressions can

7428
03:20:27,680 --> 03:20:28,880
eat shit!!

7429
03:20:30,180 --> 03:20:31,750
Affair Kamen, next year will be very busy

7430
03:20:31,750 --> 03:20:36,760
Affair Kamen, next year will be very busy

7431
03:20:34,770 --> 03:20:34,870
Yes!!

7432
03:20:34,870 --> 03:20:36,760
Yes!!

7433
03:20:36,760 --> 03:20:39,190
Don't say such indecent things!!

7434
03:20:46,170 --> 03:20:48,500
That pisses me off

7435
03:20:48,740 --> 03:20:52,010
What's with their walk?

7436
03:20:50,720 --> 03:20:52,010
They're both walking in sync

7437
03:20:52,010 --> 03:20:55,080
Are they going to continue walking

7438
03:20:52,010 --> 03:20:55,080
like that?

7439
03:20:56,910 --> 03:20:58,450
That was a close one

7440
03:20:58,980 --> 03:21:02,260
I can't believe I was saved by that affair bastard

7441
03:21:02,520 --> 03:21:04,620
Bring in that other suspect!!

7442
03:21:04,110 --> 03:21:04,620
Yes

7443
03:21:04,620 --> 03:21:06,690
Still going?

7444
03:21:04,950 --> 03:21:06,690
There's more?

7445
03:21:04,950 --> 03:21:08,860
The next suspect appears

7446
03:21:09,190 --> 03:21:10,100
Pardon me

7447
03:21:10,100 --> 03:21:10,920
Over here

7448
03:21:11,730 --> 03:21:15,290
Suspect

7449
03:21:11,730 --> 03:21:15,290
T/N: Takito Kenichi is an actor who has appeared in many famous movies and shows like Godzilla: Tokyo SOS, Boys Over Flowers, etc.

7450
03:21:11,730 --> 03:21:15,290
Takito Kenichi

7451
03:21:15,290 --> 03:21:17,000
No way

7452
03:21:16,060 --> 03:21:17,000
Wow amazing

7453
03:21:17,000 --> 03:21:18,170
Oohh!!

7454
03:21:20,470 --> 03:21:23,040
Takito-san...

7455
03:21:26,100 --> 03:21:27,910
Hey Takito

7456
03:21:27,910 --> 03:21:30,040
Why don't ya hurry up and confess?

7457
03:21:30,040 --> 03:21:31,410
How long do you intend to

7458
03:21:31,720 --> 03:21:34,820
protect that woman?

7459
03:21:34,820 --> 03:21:36,540
Mr. Officer

7460
03:21:36,540 --> 03:21:38,740
This again?

7461
03:21:38,740 --> 03:21:41,680
As I have told you several times

7462
03:21:41,680 --> 03:21:43,390
I am the culprit

7463
03:21:44,150 --> 03:21:45,530
No

7464
03:21:45,530 --> 03:21:48,800
That woman is the culprit in this murder case

7465
03:21:49,360 --> 03:21:50,680
You realized

7466
03:21:50,680 --> 03:21:52,330
that the scene of the crime

7467
03:21:52,330 --> 03:21:58,300
took place in that woman's own home, so you decided to take her place to hide her felony

7468
03:21:59,040 --> 03:22:00,300
Isn't that right?

7469
03:22:02,970 --> 03:22:05,940
I must say, detective, I'm fed up with your wild ideas

7470
03:22:06,540 --> 03:22:08,280
You're such an obstinate man

7471
03:22:08,710 --> 03:22:10,310
It was me who did everything

7472
03:22:11,340 --> 03:22:12,550
Enough with this!

7473
03:22:13,270 --> 03:22:15,260
Have you ever thought about what would happen to your own life?

7474
03:22:15,260 --> 03:22:16,200
I don't care anymore!

7475
03:22:17,220 --> 03:22:18,300
I'm fine with this

7476
03:22:21,190 --> 03:22:23,110
What happened to the girl he's protecting?

7477
03:22:21,190 --> 03:22:26,780
The suspect tries to cover up for a certain woman

7478
03:22:23,720 --> 03:22:25,910
I must say, I've been in this line of work for a long time

7479
03:22:26,840 --> 03:22:28,740
That's the first time I've came across an idiot like you

7480
03:22:32,680 --> 03:22:33,900
...It's my loss

7481
03:22:35,880 --> 03:22:37,430
Wait!!

7482
03:22:36,780 --> 03:22:37,420
Let me go!

7483
03:22:37,420 --> 03:22:38,070
Wait!

7484
03:22:38,070 --> 03:22:38,760
Let me go!!

7485
03:22:40,280 --> 03:22:42,760
Here she comes

7486
03:22:40,900 --> 03:22:42,280
She's here

7487
03:22:42,780 --> 03:22:45,620
T/N: Tomochika is a comedian who has appeared in a couple of Batsu games and Gaki no Tsukai episodes

7488
03:22:42,780 --> 03:22:45,620
Takito's Partner

7489
03:22:42,780 --> 03:22:45,620
Tomochika

7490
03:22:43,460 --> 03:22:45,450
Why are you doing all of this for me?

7491
03:22:46,070 --> 03:22:46,870
Why are you here?

7492
03:22:48,220 --> 03:22:51,030
I can't lie anymore

7493
03:22:51,110 --> 03:22:52,090
What are you saying?

7494
03:22:55,830 --> 03:22:56,680
I'm so sorry

7495
03:22:58,470 --> 03:23:01,770
I can't just have a calm expression and be happy with this, by myself

7496
03:23:02,980 --> 03:23:05,720
It was me, detective! The murderer was me!

7497
03:23:05,720 --> 03:23:08,140
What the hell are you saying? Don't say such stupid lies!

7498
03:23:09,000 --> 03:23:10,470
It's true, I did it!

7499
03:23:10,470 --> 03:23:12,630
Detective, there's something wrong with her right now

7500
03:23:12,630 --> 03:23:14,140
It was me who did it, it was me!

7501
03:23:14,150 --> 03:23:17,180
Takito!

7502
03:23:15,180 --> 03:23:17,340
Tomochika didn't do anything, please believe me!

7503
03:23:17,340 --> 03:23:18,440
It was me all along!

7504
03:23:18,440 --> 03:23:19,020
Takito!

7505
03:23:18,650 --> 03:23:21,180
I did it! I'm the one who did it!

7506
03:23:19,720 --> 03:23:20,420
Takito!!

7507
03:23:22,200 --> 03:23:23,760
Takito!!

7508
03:23:24,070 --> 03:23:26,460
Why is she shouting his surname?

7509
03:23:27,500 --> 03:23:28,440
I'm the one bearing this sin

7510
03:23:29,110 --> 03:23:30,140
So I'll accept my punishment

7511
03:23:31,500 --> 03:23:35,530
Crying?

7512
03:23:34,070 --> 03:23:34,860
Why...?

7513
03:23:35,590 --> 03:23:36,600
He's crying!

7514
03:23:38,300 --> 03:23:39,400
Why!?

7515
03:23:39,580 --> 03:23:41,400
Your...

7516
03:23:41,660 --> 03:23:43,400
The way you said it was weird

7517
03:23:43,210 --> 03:23:44,170
I'm sorry

7518
03:23:48,460 --> 03:23:49,190
I'm sorry...

7519
03:23:48,820 --> 03:23:49,850
So loud

7520
03:23:50,170 --> 03:23:51,290
He surely got into this

7521
03:24:01,900 --> 03:24:03,800
He's so irritating, geez

7522
03:24:03,860 --> 03:24:05,020
That was amazing

7523
03:24:06,740 --> 03:24:08,310
So much acting

7524
03:24:16,550 --> 03:24:17,480
Say, when I'll be released

7525
03:24:18,140 --> 03:24:19,860
Let's go to my parent's house in Ehime

7526
03:24:18,140 --> 03:24:19,860
T/N: Ehime is prefecture in Shikoku in Southern Japan

7527
03:24:20,650 --> 03:24:22,020
It's warm there

7528
03:24:21,310 --> 03:24:23,450
Huh? Is she for real?

7529
03:24:22,380 --> 03:24:24,520
And the food is pretty good too

7530
03:24:25,270 --> 03:24:27,000
Also, there's the Dogo Onsen

7531
03:24:27,400 --> 03:24:28,070
The hot springs, right?

7532
03:24:29,220 --> 03:24:32,600
You know, they say Dogo Onsen is Japan's greatest hot spring

7533
03:24:33,300 --> 03:24:36,660
It's a modern Japanese-styled architecture and it's also part of the Important Cultural Properties of Japan

7534
03:24:36,660 --> 03:24:37,990
What is she talking about?

7535
03:24:37,990 --> 03:24:43,990
You know, at night, red lights softly light up over the building rooftops and they create such a bewitching atmosphere

7536
03:24:44,520 --> 03:24:46,140
It kinda looks like a red light district

7537
03:24:47,040 --> 03:24:52,580
Just like "Yoshiwara Enjo" from Gosha Hideo's world

7538
03:24:47,040 --> 03:24:52,580
T/N: "Yoshiwara Enjo" is a 1987 softcore sex movie, set in a red light district

7539
03:24:48,650 --> 03:24:52,580
Just like "Yoshiwara Enjo" from Gosha Hideo's world

7540
03:24:50,310 --> 03:24:51,220
There it is

7541
03:24:53,430 --> 03:24:55,930
"The road of paradise the man walked back and forth"

7542
03:24:56,100 --> 03:24:58,140
"Is the infernal road where the girl was sold"

7543
03:24:58,950 --> 03:25:01,150
"So for one night, as much as possible"

7544
03:25:01,620 --> 03:25:06,260
"Hold this body of mine in your arms, cleanly"

7545
03:25:09,430 --> 03:25:10,700
You should stop them!!

7546
03:25:12,200 --> 03:25:13,730
What the hell was that conversation?

7547
03:25:13,770 --> 03:25:14,360
For real

7548
03:25:17,040 --> 03:25:19,940
What kind of conversation was that?

7549
03:25:20,020 --> 03:25:23,220
If I'm with you, Takito, I feel like I could overcome everything

7550
03:25:24,140 --> 03:25:25,910
Let's make up for my crime together

7551
03:25:31,180 --> 03:25:31,780
What do you mean?

7552
03:25:36,470 --> 03:25:37,910
If I die...

7553
03:25:38,150 --> 03:25:39,580
Truth will remain concealed in shadows

7554
03:25:40,070 --> 03:25:40,900
What are you holding?

7555
03:25:41,530 --> 03:25:43,670
What do you intend to d-- TAKITO!

7556
03:25:43,990 --> 03:25:44,820
Takito!

7557
03:25:47,270 --> 03:25:48,100
What are y-

7558
03:25:48,810 --> 03:25:49,830
Takito!!

7559
03:25:50,280 --> 03:25:51,720
You're kidding me, right? Takito!

7560
03:25:52,390 --> 03:25:54,040
Don't you do something so stupid!

7561
03:25:54,280 --> 03:25:55,130
Takito!

7562
03:25:57,020 --> 03:25:57,940
He's just looking

7563
03:25:59,290 --> 03:26:00,380
I just wanted to be happy...

7564
03:26:02,440 --> 03:26:04,500
Takito? Takito!

7565
03:26:05,030 --> 03:26:06,390
This is not true! Takito!

7566
03:26:06,390 --> 03:26:07,260
Takito's dead

7567
03:26:06,820 --> 03:26:15,260
Takito commits suicide by poison in the interrogation room

7568
03:26:10,340 --> 03:26:11,140
He died

7569
03:26:13,140 --> 03:26:13,780
He fell down pretty hard

7570
03:26:14,100 --> 03:26:14,820
Takito!

7571
03:26:16,180 --> 03:26:17,660
He ended up dying

7572
03:26:18,130 --> 03:26:18,860
You're probably not wrong

7573
03:26:18,860 --> 03:26:20,930
You're probably not wrong

7574
03:26:20,930 --> 03:26:23,740
You did the right thing!

7575
03:26:24,070 --> 03:26:26,330
I'm so sorry... Takito!

7576
03:26:26,330 --> 03:26:28,670
I'm so sorry... Takito!

7577
03:26:33,780 --> 03:26:39,220
Takito-Happy-Boy appears

7578
03:26:40,440 --> 03:26:41,340
WOW! Here I am!

7579
03:26:41,340 --> 03:26:43,990

WELCOME TO HAPPY BOY! Here I am!

You know, you guys

7585
03:26:51,730 --> 03:26:52,870
I wasn't dead after all!

7586
03:26:52,870 --> 03:26:55,170
I wasn't dead after all!

7587
03:26:55,170 --> 03:26:56,140
What I swallowed before was just a happy-medicine!!

7588
03:26:56,140 --> 03:26:58,000
What I swallowed before was just a happy-medicine!!

7589
03:26:58,000 --> 03:26:58,500
And now I'm live-live-lively as ever!!

7590
03:26:58,500 --> 03:26:59,040
And now I'm live-live-lively as ever!!

7591
03:26:59,040 --> 03:26:59,340
And now I'm live-live-lively as ever!!

7592
03:26:59,340 --> 03:26:59,740
And now I'm live-live-lively as ever!!

7593
03:26:59,740 --> 03:27:03,740
And now I'm live-live-lively as ever!!

7594
03:27:00,810 --> 03:27:03,740
Hahahah

7595
03:27:04,710 --> 03:27:12,020
The original Happy Boy appears

7596
03:27:06,950 --> 03:27:07,690
Here's the one

7597
03:27:08,620 --> 03:27:10,140
What the-

7598
03:27:13,370 --> 03:27:13,850
Babyon's here!

7599
03:27:13,850 --> 03:27:14,750
Babyon's here!

7600
03:27:14,750 --> 03:27:16,120
Thanks so much!

7601
03:27:16,470 --> 03:27:17,850
Thank you!

7602
03:27:18,160 --> 03:27:19,730
Somehow when the real one showed up, your enthusiasm crumbled down

7603
03:27:19,730 --> 03:27:20,530
Somehow when the real one showed up, your enthusiasm crumbled down

7604
03:27:20,530 --> 03:27:22,160
Somehow when the real one showed up, your enthusiasm crumbled down

7605
03:27:22,160 --> 03:27:23,800
That is surely one hell of a situation to be in!

7606
03:27:23,800 --> 03:27:25,260
But let's leave that behind

7607
03:27:25,500 --> 03:27:26,830
Are you okay?

7608
03:27:26,830 --> 03:27:28,400
An amazing performance, I must say

7609
03:27:28,400 --> 03:27:30,570
But this is different from a drama

7610
03:27:30,600 --> 03:27:31,440
It's variety!

7611
03:27:31,440 --> 03:27:31,790
A su-su-super-variety! Is it okay?

7612
03:27:31,790 --> 03:27:32,100
A su-su-super-variety! Is it okay?

7613
03:27:32,100 --> 03:27:32,770
A su-su-super-variety! Is it okay?

7614
03:27:32,770 --> 03:27:34,010
A su-su-super-variety! Is it okay?

7615
03:27:34,020 --> 03:27:36,410
Let's overcome the opposition from our agency~

7616
03:27:36,410 --> 03:27:36,930
Oh my!

7617
03:27:36,930 --> 03:27:39,680
The life of an actor is a huge burn

7618
03:27:39,700 --> 03:27:42,820
Let's just cool it down with my icy jokes!!

7619
03:27:42,950 --> 03:27:43,350
Frosty touch!

7620
03:27:43,350 --> 03:27:44,120
Frosty touch!

7621
03:27:44,120 --> 03:27:45,320
Ouch! He's hot!

7622
03:27:45,320 --> 03:27:46,550
Must be a power spot!

7623
03:27:46,150 --> 03:27:46,950
That's super stupid!

7624
03:27:46,820 --> 03:27:48,500
What are you saying?!

7625
03:27:48,740 --> 03:27:49,850
What the hell?

7626
03:27:50,960 --> 03:27:51,720
And your partner

7627
03:27:51,720 --> 03:27:52,360
And your partner

7628
03:27:52,360 --> 03:27:53,460
The sad performance Tomochika-chan just did...

7629
03:27:53,460 --> 03:27:55,290
The sad performance Tomochika-chan just did...

7630
03:27:55,290 --> 03:27:56,130
Excellent!

7631
03:27:56,130 --> 03:27:57,760
Superb~!

7632
03:27:58,110 --> 03:28:00,870
Yeah but the one who wants to cry is you isn't it?

7633
03:28:00,880 --> 03:28:03,100
While I can say I am Happy Boy

7634
03:28:03,550 --> 03:28:06,210
Inside my heart I'm unhappy

7635
03:28:05,840 --> 03:28:07,350
Hey!

7636
03:28:09,390 --> 03:28:11,240
Happy Boy

7637
03:28:11,240 --> 03:28:12,100
WOW!

7638
03:28:12,410 --> 03:28:13,140
SEE YOU!!

7639
03:28:17,500 --> 03:28:19,690
I'm watching you as you fail~

7640
03:28:19,990 --> 03:28:22,920
Please say something!

7641
03:28:26,250 --> 03:28:27,540
That was impressive

7642
03:28:28,330 --> 03:28:30,030
He went through the end

7643
03:28:29,340 --> 03:28:30,330
Yeah, incredible

7644
03:28:33,570 --> 03:28:37,070
That was a high level performance

7645
03:28:36,460 --> 03:28:37,590
Didn't expect it to turn out this way

7646
03:28:38,570 --> 03:28:40,410
It was this after all

7647
03:28:41,070 --> 03:28:43,140
It's one of those times when things develop this way, right?

7648
03:28:43,140 --> 03:28:45,180
It's one of those times when things develop this way, right?

7649
03:28:45,180 --> 03:28:46,580
You got me, right?

7650
03:28:46,580 --> 03:28:47,420
Not at all

7651
03:28:47,420 --> 03:28:48,600
I don't get it

7652
03:28:49,350 --> 03:28:50,520
What point of view is it?

7653
03:28:50,530 --> 03:28:54,150
Eventually, us women are left all alone

7654
03:28:54,150 --> 03:28:55,750
You know what I'm saying?

7655
03:28:56,090 --> 03:28:58,690
Don't make eye contact with me!

7656
03:28:59,420 --> 03:29:01,010
By the moment two lovers part, only the woman is sad

7657
03:29:01,010 --> 03:29:02,030
By the moment two lovers part, only the woman is sad

7658
03:29:03,560 --> 03:29:04,900
But you all know that, right?

7659
03:29:05,230 --> 03:29:07,170
Don't look here

7660
03:29:09,540 --> 03:29:10,150
She makes me angry

7661
03:29:09,860 --> 03:29:11,000
Yeah she-

7662
03:29:11,000 --> 03:29:13,000
What the hell was she trying to say?

7663
03:29:19,030 --> 03:29:24,090
That famous man is about to appear before the totally exhausted five men

7664
03:29:20,410 --> 03:29:24,250
11 hours passed since their duty
at the police station began

7665
03:29:27,250 --> 03:29:30,120
Center of political economy

7666
03:29:27,930 --> 03:29:30,010
The town representing the center of political economy

7667
03:29:30,010 --> 03:29:34,200
Which gathers people from all around the world: New York

7668
03:29:30,290 --> 03:29:34,230
America - New York

7669
03:29:34,240 --> 03:29:40,330
Various brutal events occur

7670
03:29:35,260 --> 03:29:37,530
While one side shows its gorgeous sights,

7671
03:29:38,020 --> 03:29:43,740
The other side shows a city of high crime rates, where lots of brutal incidents happen constantly

7672
03:29:40,600 --> 03:29:44,100
City of frequent crimes

7673
03:29:44,220 --> 03:29:50,310
Drawing near to the way of life of a legendary policeman

7674
03:29:45,350 --> 03:29:54,540
What we'll show you now is the real footage of our legendary policemen willing to risk their own life for the sake of their city

7675
03:29:55,710 --> 03:30:01,290
The man with a sense of smell that exceeds a police dog

7676
03:29:55,980 --> 03:30:01,270
File No.1 - a man blessed with a sense of smell way better than any police dog

7677
03:30:01,490 --> 03:30:06,490
A hundred million times stronger than a human's

7678
03:30:02,740 --> 03:30:06,060
The sense of smell of a police dog is said to be a hundred million times better than a humans'

7679
03:30:06,660 --> 03:30:12,530
The legendary policeman outdoing police dogs' sense of smell

7680
03:30:07,740 --> 03:30:12,260
But there was a legendary policeman blessed with a nose surpassing those of the police dogs

7681
03:30:14,940 --> 03:30:17,660
And it's this man

7682
03:30:20,940 --> 03:30:25,440
Hideaki Jimmy Onishi

7683
03:30:20,940 --> 03:30:25,440
Legendary Policeman

7684
03:30:25,540 --> 03:30:28,450
Olfactory Experiment

7685
03:30:28,450 --> 03:30:32,950
Grapefruit

7686
03:30:28,450 --> 03:30:32,950

Orange

7690
03:30:28,550 --> 03:30:32,950
5 kinds of citrus-related fruit

7691
03:30:30,140 --> 03:30:32,940
We'll choose one from these five fruits belonging to the citrus family

7692
03:30:33,190 --> 03:30:40,230
A tissue will be soaked with the smell of its peel
He has to guess the correct answer by smelling it

7693
03:30:33,910 --> 03:30:36,710
We'll have him smell a tissue used to wipe the peel of one of them

7694
03:30:37,110 --> 03:30:40,230
Correct answer: Orange

7695
03:30:37,770 --> 03:30:39,060
And see if he can answer correctly

7696
03:30:47,000 --> 03:30:51,040
Correct Answer: Orange

7697
03:30:51,180 --> 03:30:54,380
Is the sense of smell of the legendary policeman Jimmy legit?

7698
03:30:51,270 --> 03:30:55,740
Can Jimmy's sense of smell...?

7699
03:31:07,850 --> 03:31:08,390
Orange

7700
03:31:10,170 --> 03:31:12,980
Jimmy cleared the challenge splendidly

7701
03:31:13,820 --> 03:31:15,320
As expected from a legendary policeman

7702
03:31:16,460 --> 03:31:21,170
How can you distinguish the smell of citrus fruits?

7703
03:31:21,170 --> 03:31:24,870
From my nose to my brain... i-it soaked in

7704
03:31:24,870 --> 03:31:29,340
From my nose to my brain... i-it soaked in

7705
03:31:29,340 --> 03:31:31,540
From my nose to my brain... i-it soaked in

7706
03:31:32,210 --> 03:31:34,010
That's the smell of citrus fruits

7707
03:31:39,380 --> 03:31:46,020
I think that's a pretty dangerous way of smelling things

7708
03:31:43,430 --> 03:31:46,020
It has begun

7709
03:31:46,440 --> 03:31:48,010
This year too, it has begun

7710
03:31:46,560 --> 03:31:48,350
Are we going with this, this year?

7711
03:31:48,360 --> 03:31:53,720
That's the smell of citrus fruits

7712
03:31:50,220 --> 03:31:53,720
Citrous?

7713
03:31:53,920 --> 03:31:56,460
Those rancid smelling things, right?

7714
03:31:56,460 --> 03:32:02,240
You mean citrus fruits?

7715
03:31:58,790 --> 03:32:02,240
Citrous?

7716
03:32:07,220 --> 03:32:09,780
What's this guy's deal, really?

7717
03:32:14,100 --> 03:32:15,140
What's he doing?

7718
03:32:15,140 --> 03:32:16,920
What's so funny?

7719
03:32:15,400 --> 03:32:17,760
What are you laughing at?

7720
03:32:17,760 --> 03:32:19,280
What are you laughing at?

7721
03:32:25,250 --> 03:32:26,320
His face when he laughs is dangerous

7722
03:32:26,320 --> 03:32:28,090
His face when he laughs is dangerous

7723
03:32:28,090 --> 03:32:31,890
You mean citrus fruits?

7724
03:32:28,460 --> 03:32:31,890
Citrous?

7725
03:32:41,780 --> 03:32:44,140
That's enough, let's skip past this

7726
03:32:42,320 --> 03:32:43,280
We're doomed

7727
03:32:44,140 --> 03:32:45,340
Really...

7728
03:32:44,940 --> 03:32:47,040
I'd like him to stop saying  "Citrous"

7729
03:32:49,640 --> 03:32:51,540
Citrous?

7730
03:32:51,860 --> 03:32:56,820
Jimmy's legend will continue

7731
03:32:57,150 --> 03:33:01,390
It says it will continue

7732
03:32:58,940 --> 03:33:00,640
They're eager to do it too

7733
03:33:01,620 --> 03:33:03,220
They are eager to get it all in, Tanaka

7734
03:33:04,380 --> 03:33:05,340

Today we have a special opportunity to meet him, so let's go

7737
03:33:11,680 --> 03:33:13,930
Today we have a special opportunity to meet him, so let's go

7738
03:33:13,930 --> 03:33:15,500
Calling it lucky doesn't seem very... Accurate

7739
03:33:15,500 --> 03:33:16,770
Calling it lucky doesn't seem very... Accurate

7740
03:33:15,700 --> 03:33:17,400
This seems kinda cool

7741
03:33:16,620 --> 03:33:17,780
Yeah

7742
03:33:17,960 --> 03:33:18,900

high intelligence quotient you know

7772
03:34:19,740 --> 03:34:22,840
You're a fool with a low IQ...

7773
03:34:23,840 --> 03:34:25,940
You can't even speak properly

7774
03:34:26,440 --> 03:34:34,550
Professor Itao's ability

7775
03:34:26,440 --> 03:34:34,550
Can perform psychoanalysis from casual conversation

7776
03:34:29,500 --> 03:34:30,560
You stuttering fatass

7777
03:34:35,650 --> 03:34:39,420
Why?

7778
03:34:37,500 --> 03:34:39,420
He's got quite the chest, eh?

7779
03:34:45,720 --> 03:34:46,960
But why...

7780
03:34:45,900 --> 03:34:47,020
They're bigger than they should...

7781
03:34:46,760 --> 03:34:49,000
I was thinking about that too

7782
03:34:47,440 --> 03:34:49,060
He's got tits

7783
03:34:48,660 --> 03:34:51,160
It's not a D-cup though

7784
03:34:50,340 --> 03:34:51,120
Barely there

7785
03:34:51,160 --> 03:34:54,300
Psychoanalyzing the group

7786
03:34:51,180 --> 03:34:52,140

7787
03:34:55,500 --> 03:34:59,700
Fish lips

7788
03:35:00,440 --> 03:35:00,700
Yes?

7789
03:35:01,340 --> 03:35:02,180
You figured out that you are "fish lips" all by yourself?

7790
03:35:02,180 --> 03:35:04,740
You figured out that you are "fish lips" all by yourself?

7791
03:35:05,600 --> 03:35:06,740
Well, the others were...

7792
03:35:06,680 --> 03:35:08,680
T/N: Cod roe is a common side dish to eat with rice.

7793
03:35:06,680 --> 03:35:08,680
What are you like when you eat cod roe?

7794
03:35:08,900 --> 03:35:12,280
What?

7795
03:35:15,400 --> 03:35:16,860
Can't get away...

7796
03:35:15,520 --> 03:35:19,700
What the hell are you asking me?

7797
03:35:18,040 --> 03:35:20,400
He just went straight for it

7798
03:35:22,230 --> 03:35:22,830
He's quick to the punch

7799
03:35:22,830 --> 03:35:24,830
He's quick to the punch

7800
03:35:23,460 --> 03:35:25,960
Yeah, yeah...

7801
03:35:26,500 --> 03:35:30,440
Fish-lipped boy

7802
03:35:30,700 --> 03:35:33,570
What is the best thing to eat in the winter?

7803
03:35:35,040 --> 03:35:36,280
That'd be hot pot

7804
03:35:36,440 --> 03:35:41,250
What do you put in that hot pot?

7805
03:35:39,910 --> 03:35:41,250
Tofu and...

7806
03:35:41,450 --> 03:35:43,210
So you like tofu?

7807
03:35:44,650 --> 03:35:46,730
It's not like I absolutely

7808
03:35:45,790 --> 03:35:46,720
love it though

7809
03:35:46,250 --> 03:35:50,190
What is your favorite thing to put in a hot pot?

7810
03:35:46,720 --> 03:35:50,190
Generally, hot pot

7811
03:35:47,990 --> 03:35:50,190
will include things like tofu

7812
03:35:53,640 --> 03:35:56,820
What, what is this...

7813
03:35:56,830 --> 03:35:58,870
Let's make a compromise

7814
03:35:59,730 --> 03:36:00,470
If one of you doesn't compromise...

7815
03:36:00,470 --> 03:36:03,340
If one of you doesn't compromise...

7816
03:36:03,760 --> 03:36:05,520
He just keeps talking

7817
03:36:05,040 --> 03:36:07,310
It's because you didn't compromise, Hamada-san

7818
03:36:07,870 --> 03:36:10,710
Fish Lips

7819
03:36:10,780 --> 03:36:16,770
You're pretty good atsocializing

7820
03:36:11,900 --> 03:36:16,770
at socializing

7821
03:36:14,310 --> 03:36:16,770
He stuttered

7822
03:36:16,980 --> 03:36:19,620
But the truth is you hate everyone

7823
03:36:19,620 --> 03:36:26,090
Good at socializing, but hates everyone

7824
03:36:19,620 --> 03:36:26,090
Hamada's Psychoanalysis

7825
03:36:21,480 --> 03:36:25,380
So it's that kind of analysis

7826
03:36:23,800 --> 03:36:24,940
Just now?

7827
03:36:24,940 --> 03:36:26,060
Does he actually know?

7828
03:36:26,060 --> 03:36:27,060
He's staring...

7829
03:36:30,900 --> 03:36:33,930
Midget storyteller

7830
03:36:36,470 --> 03:36:38,270

Psychoanalysis through puzzles

7832
03:36:41,100 --> 03:36:42,780
He's trying to get in your head

7833
03:36:42,710 --> 03:36:45,950
Repeat after me

7834
03:36:44,960 --> 03:36:45,320
OK

7835
03:36:46,360 --> 03:36:51,180
How is Nihon Television

7836
03:36:48,800 --> 03:36:51,140
How is Nihon Television

7837
03:36:51,180 --> 03:36:57,320
like two grand slams?

7838
03:36:54,380 --> 03:36:57,280
like two grand slams?

7839
03:36:57,320 --> 03:37:00,390
The answer?

7840
03:36:59,660 --> 03:37:00,390
The answer?

7841
03:37:00,490 --> 03:37:03,230
BALLS!!

7842
03:37:03,700 --> 03:37:05,230
Balls?

7843
03:37:09,440 --> 03:37:13,760
He said the answer. What's the point?

7844
03:37:10,640 --> 03:37:12,380
I don't get it

7845
03:37:19,920 --> 03:37:25,140

7847
03:37:27,620 --> 03:37:29,100

Look

7849
03:37:52,060 --> 03:37:55,680
There's something weird here

7850
03:37:52,960 --> 03:37:54,060
Wait...

7851
03:37:53,260 --> 03:37:54,960
Hold up

7852
03:38:00,320 --> 03:38:01,720
Those are pretty good!!

7853
03:38:02,220 --> 03:38:03,820
What do you mean 'pretty good'?

7854
03:38:04,490 --> 03:38:06,430
What do you mean "Those are pretty good!?"

7855
03:38:06,890 --> 03:38:14,870
He has realistic breasts

7856
03:38:06,890 --> 03:38:14,870
Professor Itao's Secret

7857
03:38:09,560 --> 03:38:11,360
You thought they're small

7858
03:38:11,120 --> 03:38:14,400
They looked pretty small when clothed

7859
03:38:12,780 --> 03:38:14,870
The size of his clothes...

7860
03:38:14,870 --> 03:38:17,340
They're the kind that  look smaller with clothes on

7861
03:38:17,740 --> 03:38:20,210
I'm going to sleep Leave!

7862

03:38:24,140 --> 03:38:25,680
I think we should go everyone

7865
03:38:27,850 --> 03:38:29,820
That was insane

7866
03:38:30,430 --> 03:38:33,990
That really was bizarre

7867
03:38:31,580 --> 03:38:33,380
Absolutely terrifying

7868
03:38:35,920 --> 03:38:39,460

7890
03:39:38,520 --> 03:39:42,920

7894
03:39:45,490 --> 03:39:47,060
On Downtown DX, there was a magician

7895
03:39:47,280 --> 03:39:50,880
He asked a female celebrity to write a two-digit number on paper

7896
03:39:51,180 --> 03:39:52,200
then the magician said

7897
03:39:52,370 --> 03:39:57,140
I don't want you guys thinking I can see it, so

7898
03:39:54,620 --> 03:39:55,270
Mr. Matsumoto please apply a blindfold

7899
03:39:55,270 --> 03:39:57,140
Mr. Matsumoto please apply a blindfold

7900
03:39:57,140 --> 03:39:57,800
Matsumoto then blindfolded himself

7901
03:39:57,800 --> 03:39:59,700
Matsumoto then blindfolded himself

7902
03:40:03,980 --> 03:40:04,920

7905
03:40:08,920 --> 03:40:09,640
Wow

7906
03:40:09,740 --> 03:40:11,680
Is that showing his age? Or is it something else?

7907
03:40:11,800 --> 03:40:12,980
What is that?

7908
03:40:12,640 --> 03:40:13,540
You're kidding

7909
03:40:13,850 --> 03:40:15,660
That's a sign he should retire!!

7910
03:40:16,120 --> 03:40:17,660
He should retire if that's the case

7911
03:40:18,460 --> 03:40:19,060
Anyone else?

7912
03:40:21,160 --> 03:40:23,460

7938
03:41:11,720 --> 03:41:12,820
Anyone else?

7950
03:41:33,770 --> 03:41:36,900
"But this is my favorite pair... Please wash them!!" he says

7951
03:41:39,040 --> 03:41:40,640
Having no choice, she pretended to wash it, then secretly threw it away

7952
03:41:40,640 --> 03:41:43,580
Having no choice, she pretended to wash it, then secretly threw it away

7953
03:41:43,580 --> 03:41:47,550
Normally Hamada won't mind this, but

7954
03:41:47,550 --> 03:41:52,730
Surprisingly,

7955
03:41:48,700 --> 03:41:52,730
he said, "I really liked that pair..."

7956
03:41:50,590 --> 03:41:52,730
He was depressed for a while

7957
03:41:55,220 --> 03:41:56,960
Is that true?

7958
03:41:56,960 --> 03:41:59,500
"I really liked that pair"

7959
03:41:57,800 --> 03:41:59,500
Even though they were soiled

7960
03:42:00,830 --> 03:42:02,840
No matter what, he wanted to wear that pair

7961
03:42:02,840 --> 03:42:04,800
No matter what, he wanted to wear that pair

7962
03:42:05,360 --> 03:42:06,760
Yes

7963
03:42:06,760 --> 03:42:09,660
It's regarding Downtown Matsumoto

7964
03:42:09,560 --> 03:42:14,340
Now, he was on location with Kurose

7965
03:42:09,560 --> 03:42:14,340
T/N: The guy currently speaking is Kurose.

7966
03:42:09,650 --> 03:42:39,170
During filming in Fukuoka

7967
03:42:09,650 --> 03:42:39,170
Matsumoto Hitoshi Files

7968
03:42:14,950 --> 03:42:16,580
When Matsumoto comes to Fukuoka,
if his face is revealed it causesa commotion

7969
03:42:16,580 --> 03:42:18,220
When Matsumoto comes to Fukuoka,
if his face is revealed it causes a commotion

7970
03:42:18,220 --> 03:42:20,950
When Matsumoto comes to Fukuoka,
if his face is revealed it causes a commotion

7971
03:42:22,120 --> 03:42:24,220
So when he comes to Fukuoka, he wears a mask

7972
03:42:22,120 --> 03:42:26,230
T/N: The masks they're referring to are the ones you wear to cover your mouth when coughing. However, they're also often used to hide your face. They're generally for single-use.

7973
03:42:24,220 --> 03:42:26,230
When filming finishes, mask

7974
03:42:26,230 --> 03:42:27,730
During transit, mask
Then when going to a bar after dinner, mask

7975
03:42:27,730 --> 03:42:30,160
During transit, mask
Then when going to a bar after dinner, mask

7976
03:42:30,160 --> 03:42:31,300
And then after using it a ton

7977
03:42:31,300 --> 03:42:32,800
We get back to the hotel and with the mask that he had used all day

7978
03:42:32,800 --> 03:42:35,400
We get back to the hotel and with the mask that he had used all day

7979
03:42:34,000 --> 03:42:35,400
He said, "I'm so tired"

7980
03:42:35,400 --> 03:42:37,100
Took the mask off, and then put it into a ziplock bag

7981
03:42:37,100 --> 03:42:39,170
Took the mask off, and then put it into a ziplock bag

7982
03:42:44,740 --> 03:42:46,900
Are you serious?

7983
03:42:45,500 --> 03:42:46,900
Serious?

7984
03:42:48,850 --> 03:42:51,250
That was just coincidental!!

7985
03:42:52,620 --> 03:42:55,250
You're rich, right?

7986
03:42:55,250 --> 03:42:56,860
The front was like a jute bag, all scrunched up

7987
03:42:56,860 --> 03:42:59,430
The front was like a jute bag, all scrunched up

7988
03:43:01,250 --> 03:43:04,860
This is also a mask story...

7989
03:43:04,040 --> 03:43:05,620
But a different mask

7990
03:43:05,060 --> 03:44:10,830
Matsumoto Hitoshi Files

7991
03:43:05,060 --> 03:44:10,830
The Mask Story

7992
03:43:05,680 --> 03:43:08,300
I went out for dinner with Matsumoto-san

7993
03:43:08,300 --> 03:43:10,140
Afterwards we went to a bar

7994
03:43:10,140 --> 03:43:13,840
Then, our kouhai who was with us gave a gift to Matsumoto-san

7995
03:43:13,840 --> 03:43:14,640
A pro-wrestling mask was given to him

7996
03:43:14,640 --> 03:43:17,410
A pro-wrestling mask was given to him

7997
03:43:17,410 --> 03:43:19,150
A pro-wrestling mask was given to him

7998
03:43:19,150 --> 03:43:22,050
Matsumoto seemed really ecstatic to receive it

7999
03:43:22,050 --> 03:43:23,850
He then put on the mask, even though no one said, "Put it on!!"

8000
03:43:23,850 --> 03:43:25,480
He then put on the mask, even though no one said, "Put it on!!"

8001
03:43:25,840 --> 03:43:28,000
So he put it on

8002
03:43:28,000 --> 03:43:32,220
And most people at that point say, 'It suits you!' and stuff like that, of course

8003
03:43:32,220 --> 03:43:35,060
And then Matsumoto-san - although we didn't say anything

8004
03:43:35,060 --> 03:43:37,160
He bared his upper body

8005
03:43:37,160 --> 03:43:39,500
He bared his upper body

8006
03:43:37,160 --> 03:43:39,500
since he's training and all

8007
03:43:39,500 --> 03:43:43,840
Then, when he takes his shirt off, it's obviously amazing, and our kouhais were going

8008
03:43:43,840 --> 03:43:46,040
"Is it really this amazing!?"

8009
03:43:46,040 --> 03:43:48,740
The more they said to him, Matsumoto, for some reason,

8010
03:43:49,140 --> 03:43:51,280
He kept asserting, "I don't work out that much"

8011
03:43:51,280 --> 03:43:53,450
He kept asserting, "I don't work out that much"

8012
03:43:54,280 --> 03:43:56,250
No matter how you look at it, he clearly works out

8013
03:43:56,250 --> 03:44:00,850
When they said, "It's seriously amazing!!"

8014
03:43:58,480 --> 03:43:59,620
the more they said it, he would say, "I don't"

8015
03:43:59,620 --> 03:44:00,850
the more they said it, he would say, "I don't"

8016
03:44:00,850 --> 03:44:02,390
By the end he was saying, "I don't work out at all!!"

8017
03:44:02,390 --> 03:44:04,390
By the end he was saying, "I don't work out at all!!"

8018
03:44:04,390 --> 03:44:05,690
Saying "I don't work out at all!!" while crossing his arms, Matsumoto's chest was

8019
03:44:05,690 --> 03:44:08,590
Saying "I don't work out at all!!" while crossing his arms, Matsumoto's chest was

8020
03:44:08,590 --> 03:44:10,830
On par with Hosokawa Fumie

8021
03:44:08,590 --> 03:44:16,830
T/N: Hosokawa Fumie is an ex-gravure idol who was popular in the 90s, also known as Fumin. She's very well known for her huge breasts.

8022
03:44:15,280 --> 03:44:17,100
Fumin?

8023
03:44:17,100 --> 03:44:19,100
You mean when she was really thin?

8024
03:44:20,780 --> 03:44:22,200
I wonder why

8025
03:44:22,200 --> 03:44:24,810
Now, now, now, anyone can speak up

8026
03:44:25,020 --> 03:44:27,520
It's about Tsukitei Hosei

8027
03:44:26,420 --> 03:44:27,520
Let's start on Hosei

8028
03:44:27,520 --> 03:44:30,520
It's now over 10 years since he became a Rakugo comedian

8029
03:44:27,790 --> 03:44:55,740
The CM Story

8030
03:44:27,790 --> 03:44:55,740
Tsukitei Hosei Files

8031
03:44:30,600 --> 03:44:35,690
He's been doing Rakugo for that time, and now he's gotten accustomed to the name Tsukitei Hosei

8032
03:44:35,690 --> 03:44:38,760
It was decided he'd appear in a commercial

8033
03:44:37,280 --> 03:44:38,760
for a Mario game for the Nintendo DS

8034
03:44:38,760 --> 03:44:42,860
He was to talk about Mario and Luigi from the game like a Rakugo skit for the commercial

8035
03:44:42,860 --> 03:44:44,960
And at the end, give a bow it's a really good commercial

8036
03:44:44,960 --> 03:44:46,100
And at the end, give a bow it's a really good commercial

8037
03:44:46,100 --> 03:44:48,970
There's actually 1 secret behind it...

8038
03:44:48,970 --> 03:44:49,740
He lowers his head

8039
03:44:49,740 --> 03:44:51,640
And actually, the top of his head is getting a bit thin

8040
03:44:51,640 --> 03:44:53,510
But in the commercial, it's not thinning

8041
03:44:53,510 --> 03:44:55,740
Nintendo was considerate enough to give him some extra hair with CG!!

8042
03:45:04,860 --> 03:45:06,920
They're all coming out

8043
03:45:06,920 --> 03:45:08,220
They don't stop

8044
03:45:08,220 --> 03:45:11,900
It's to do with Hamada

8045
03:45:11,900 --> 03:45:15,380
I heard it from Missile Man Iwabe from Osaka

8046
03:45:11,900 --> 03:45:15,380
T/N: Missile Man Iwabe is the boke of the Missile Man comedian duo. They're also from Yoshimoto Agency.

8047
03:45:13,230 --> 03:45:22,170
Informant

8048
03:45:13,230 --> 03:45:22,170
Missile Man Iwabe

8049
03:45:15,380 --> 03:45:20,370
Hamada takes good care of Iwabe, and when he returns to Osaka they often go out together

8050
03:45:20,370 --> 03:45:23,200
And then one day, when Iwabe visited Hamada at his hotel

8051
03:45:22,330 --> 03:46:21,730
At an Osaka Hotel...

8052
03:45:22,330 --> 03:46:21,730
Hamada Masatoshi Files

8053
03:45:23,200 --> 03:45:24,370
Hamada was a bit angry

8054
03:45:24,370 --> 03:45:26,270
Hamada was a bit angry

8055
03:45:26,300 --> 03:45:30,710
And for some reason, you know glow sticks...

8056
03:45:29,140 --> 03:45:37,280
Glow stick

8057
03:45:29,140 --> 03:45:37,280
Light in a rod shape

8058
03:45:30,710 --> 03:45:36,320
He was holding just 1 of them, and a bit angrily

8059
03:45:35,550 --> 03:45:36,320
Why?

8060
03:45:36,320 --> 03:45:39,020
When he asked him, he said he didn't know why

8061
03:45:39,020 --> 03:45:39,950
On that day, due to something at the hotel

8062
03:45:39,950 --> 03:45:41,450
On that day, due to something at the hotel

8063
03:45:41,450 --> 03:45:43,090
All rooms at 1 am in the night, would have their power cut

8064
03:45:43,090 --> 03:45:46,530
All rooms at 1 am in the night, would have their power cut

8065
03:45:46,530 --> 03:45:50,400
From the hotel, he was just given 1 glow stick

8066
03:45:50,920 --> 03:45:53,780
So then they decided to play cards until then

8067
03:45:53,780 --> 03:45:58,400
And while they were, all the lights in the room turned off

8068
03:45:58,400 --> 03:45:59,240
After that, he suddenly said "I need to go to the toilet"

8069
03:45:59,240 --> 03:46:01,370
After that, he suddenly said "I need to go to the toilet"

8070
03:46:01,370 --> 03:46:03,880
It's completely dark

8071
03:46:03,500 --> 03:46:08,080
So then Iwabe got the glow stick, and Hamada went to pee

8072
03:46:08,080 --> 03:46:10,050
When he held the stick to light his dick, the toilet became dark

8073
03:46:10,050 --> 03:46:12,150
When he held the stick to light his dick, the toilet became dark

8074
03:46:12,650 --> 03:46:13,990
When he held it to light the toilet, his dick would be dark

8075
03:46:13,990 --> 03:46:16,660
When he held it to light the toilet, his dick would be dark

8076
03:46:16,660 --> 03:46:18,460
He couldn't do it any other way, so Iwabe waved the glow stick at high speeds

8077
03:46:18,460 --> 03:46:19,230
He couldn't do it any other way, so Iwabe waved the glow stick at high speeds

8078
03:46:19,230 --> 03:46:21,730
He couldn't do it any other way, so Iwabe waved the glow stick at high speeds

8079
03:46:26,560 --> 03:46:27,460
For the after image

8080
03:46:28,960 --> 03:46:30,940
For the after image, the after image right

8081
03:46:31,140 --> 03:46:32,960
I get it, you get it right?

8082
03:46:32,460 --> 03:46:34,170
I don't get it

8083
03:46:34,170 --> 03:46:36,940
If he just went before the power cut

8084
03:46:37,780 --> 03:46:38,980
About Hamada, there are times when his pranks go too far

8085
03:46:38,980 --> 03:46:41,380
About Hamada, there are times when his pranks go too far

8086
03:46:41,560 --> 03:46:44,640
He himself thinks it's just him showing his love

8087
03:46:41,560 --> 03:47:05,770
Hamada Masatoshi Files

8088
03:46:41,560 --> 03:47:05,770
Pranks go overboard

8089
03:46:44,640 --> 03:46:47,780
But one time I was leaving Itami Airport

8090
03:46:47,780 --> 03:46:50,400
And I got suddenly attacked from behind

8091
03:46:50,400 --> 03:46:54,890
It had so much force I thought I would collapse from my knees down. So when I looked behind me,

8092
03:46:54,890 --> 03:46:59,400
Hamada was on the Itami Airport floor

8093
03:46:57,100 --> 03:46:59,400
going "Kya kya kya!!" laughing

8094
03:46:59,400 --> 03:47:00,470
I was going "Ouchhh"

8095
03:47:00,470 --> 03:47:01,630
"It was a joke" he laughed just by himself

8096
03:47:01,630 --> 03:47:03,600
"It was a joke" he laughed just by himself

8097
03:47:03,600 --> 03:47:04,340
The joke bombed around the whole of Itami

8098
03:47:04,340 --> 03:47:05,770
The joke bombed around the whole of Itami

8099
03:47:09,240 --> 03:47:11,700
There are tons of people there!

8100
03:47:11,840 --> 03:47:14,060
Everyone in the Itami area

8101
03:47:14,060 --> 03:47:15,660
It bombed around the whole of Itami

8102
03:47:15,660 --> 03:47:18,520
From the bystanders' view, it's just plain violence

8103
03:47:19,260 --> 03:47:21,360
That's his home ground though, you could say

8104
03:47:22,440 --> 03:47:27,200
This isn't about cheating or anything, but..

8105
03:47:27,200 --> 03:47:29,340
It's about Komoto

8106
03:47:27,200 --> 03:47:30,830
T/N: Komoto is the guy in the green jacket and red tie.

8107
03:47:29,360 --> 03:48:38,060
Counseling

8108
03:47:29,360 --> 03:48:38,060
Komoto Junichi Files

8109
03:47:30,830 --> 03:47:32,560
Komoto came, and like, asked Daigo for some advice

8110
03:47:30,830 --> 03:47:36,240
T/N: Daigo is the guy currently talking.

8111
03:47:32,560 --> 03:47:36,240
Komoto came, and like, asked Daigo for some advice

8112
03:47:35,260 --> 03:47:36,240
Advice?

8113
03:47:36,240 --> 03:47:40,420
About his dick having problems getting up

8114
03:47:40,420 --> 03:47:44,940
And then Daigo, with a serious expression on his face that you can't laugh at

8115
03:47:44,940 --> 03:47:47,680
Was considering what could be done

8116
03:47:47,680 --> 03:47:50,140
Since Komoto has helped Daigo out a lot

8117
03:47:50,140 --> 03:47:53,760
He wanted to repay the favor, but it's not like there's anything we could do

8118
03:47:53,760 --> 03:47:58,920
So with Komoto - it wasn't like cheating

8119
03:47:58,920 --> 03:48:03,360
For starters, meet with a girl and talk

8120
03:48:03,360 --> 03:48:10,680
In the case that while having dinner, by one of her cute actions, his dick stood up

8121
03:48:10,680 --> 03:48:16,100
Then it would've been a good meeting and we could call it a success

8122
03:48:16,100 --> 03:48:19,140
So, while we're having dinner, if it stood up

8123
03:48:19,140 --> 03:48:21,550
He was to pop up his collar

8124
03:48:21,140 --> 03:48:21,940
Ah, easily visible

8125
03:48:21,940 --> 03:48:24,840
And then we can call it quits

8126
03:48:24,840 --> 03:48:26,400
So, we all got to our seats

8127
03:48:26,400 --> 03:48:29,660
And then the girl I had invited came, so I went to pick her up

8128
03:48:29,660 --> 03:48:32,620
She went in the booth first, and then I entered

8129
03:48:32,620 --> 03:48:34,360
By the time I entered Komoto's collar was like that of a Cabaret club boss, it was popped so far

8130
03:48:34,360 --> 03:48:35,190
By the time I entered Komoto's collar was like that of a Cabaret club boss, it was popped so far

8131
03:48:35,190 --> 03:48:36,600
By the time I entered Komoto's collar was like that of a Cabaret club boss, it was popped so far

8132
03:48:36,600 --> 03:48:38,060
By the time I entered Komoto's collar was like that of a Cabaret club boss, it was popped so far

8133
03:48:44,600 --> 03:48:47,200
What do you mean??

8134
03:48:48,070 --> 03:48:50,580
That was fast

8135
03:48:48,840 --> 03:48:50,580
He was quite quick

8136
03:48:50,580 --> 03:48:52,620
He didn't have anything to worry about

8137
03:48:52,620 --> 03:48:55,250
Yeah, if it was that fast, it was fraud

8138
03:48:55,240 --> 03:48:56,980
He just wanted to do that

8139
03:48:55,780 --> 03:48:56,980
He was just using you?

8140
03:48:57,960 --> 03:48:58,980
Yes, Komoto?

8141
03:48:59,240 --> 03:49:01,740
Regarding the man known as Daigo

8142
03:49:01,420 --> 03:49:36,020
Daigo Files

8143
03:49:01,420 --> 03:49:36,020
Komoto's trouble solved!?

8144
03:49:01,740 --> 03:49:08,730
So when Komoto was having troubles with his lower half

8145
03:49:08,730 --> 03:49:11,330
Daigo was his consultant and was listening to his woes

8146
03:49:11,330 --> 03:49:14,100
He had a fair bit to drink

8147
03:49:14,100 --> 03:49:19,740
And while munching on a pretty big yakitori, the top item at that joint,

8148
03:49:14,100 --> 03:49:19,740
T/N: Yakitori is grilled chicken skewers.

8149
03:49:19,740 --> 03:49:23,040
"Bro,  you don't have enough stimuli for it,"

8150
03:49:21,660 --> 03:49:23,040
is what he suddenly said

8151
03:49:23,040 --> 03:49:26,200
"What do you mean Daigo, not enough stimuli?"

8152
03:49:26,200 --> 03:49:29,480
"There's 1 lady who listens to everything I say"

8153
03:49:28,960 --> 03:49:29,480
Komoto!!

8154
03:49:29,480 --> 03:49:30,280
Komoto!!

8155
03:49:29,820 --> 03:49:36,020
"How about you sneak into the hotel room

8156
03:49:30,280 --> 03:49:32,280
Komoto!!

8157
03:49:33,500 --> 03:49:36,020
while we are embracing?"

8158
03:49:40,440 --> 03:49:41,580
Komoto!

8159
03:49:41,580 --> 03:49:43,020
Komoto!

8160
03:49:42,200 --> 03:49:43,020
What was that?

8161
03:49:43,020 --> 03:49:44,100
Komoto!

8162
03:49:44,100 --> 03:49:45,180
Komoto!

8163
03:49:45,180 --> 03:49:46,300
Komoto!

8164
03:49:48,340 --> 03:49:49,860
You can't do that, Daigo!

8165
03:49:50,440 --> 03:49:51,620
Komoto...

8166
03:49:52,840 --> 03:49:54,940
You have a dirty mouth

8167
03:49:54,940 --> 03:49:56,470
Dirty mouth!!

8168
03:49:56,470 --> 03:49:57,740
It's just a joke while having a drink,
I don't do anything like that

8169
03:49:57,740 --> 03:50:00,080
It's just a joke while having a drink,
I don't do anything like that

8170
03:50:00,080 --> 03:50:00,810
Daigo is really, extremely fast, his actions I mean

8171
03:50:00,810 --> 03:50:02,180
Daigo is really, extremely fast, his actions I mean

8172
03:50:02,180 --> 03:50:03,520
Daigo is really, extremely fast, his actions I mean

8173
03:50:03,920 --> 03:50:06,960
Tsuda is also fast!

8174
03:50:04,600 --> 03:50:06,960
Tsuda also! Tsuda is!

8175
03:50:06,960 --> 03:50:07,790
Tsuda, the other day

8176
03:50:06,960 --> 03:50:15,030
At Oita...

8177
03:50:06,960 --> 03:50:15,030
Tsuda Atsuhiro Files

8178
03:50:07,780 --> 03:50:09,960
He went to a brothel in Oita and after he paid by card

8179
03:50:09,960 --> 03:50:11,860
He went to a brothel in Oita and after he paid by card

8180
03:50:11,860 --> 03:50:12,860
The invoice came from Russia!!

8181
03:50:12,860 --> 03:50:15,030
The invoice came from Russia!!

8182
03:50:15,160 --> 03:50:16,460
What!?

8183
03:50:17,780 --> 03:50:19,460
Scary

8184
03:50:20,140 --> 03:50:21,340
What's with that?

8185
03:50:21,940 --> 03:50:25,760
That's dangerous

8186
03:50:24,480 --> 03:50:25,760
The invoice came from Russia

8187
03:50:26,920 --> 03:50:29,520
That's scary, was it okay?

8188
03:50:28,640 --> 03:50:29,520
What's with that?

8189
03:50:29,930 --> 03:50:31,780
No one gives a damn about this story!!

8190
03:50:32,300 --> 03:50:33,640
You started it!

8191
03:50:36,800 --> 03:50:39,680
9:30 pm

8192
03:50:37,130 --> 03:50:40,850
13.5 hours since starting police duty

8193
03:50:39,680 --> 03:50:44,020
At this time, Hamada notices 1 piece of equipment

8194
03:50:47,660 --> 03:50:51,530
Police Handbook Hidden in Their Pockets

8195
03:50:51,680 --> 03:50:52,560
Oh, phew

8196
03:50:52,560 --> 03:50:55,270
It wasn't just me

8197
03:50:54,140 --> 03:50:56,660
Oh everyone had one, I didn't notice

8198
03:50:56,680 --> 03:50:58,740
To be honest

8199
03:50:58,740 --> 03:51:02,440
When we were on the bus, I noticed

8200
03:51:02,440 --> 03:51:03,990
And thought it may have just been me

8201
03:51:03,990 --> 03:51:05,300
So, there must be something...

8202
03:51:05,300 --> 03:51:08,110
Must be something...

8203
03:51:05,780 --> 03:51:08,110
They must have something set up

8204
03:51:07,740 --> 03:51:10,820
Yes. Just as Matsumoto predicts...

8205
03:51:09,080 --> 03:51:16,860
The Police Handbooks Hidden On All 5 Members

8206
03:51:09,080 --> 03:51:16,860
Will Lead to a  Turbulent Climax!!

8207
03:51:10,820 --> 03:51:16,860
These handbooks will create waves just after this

8208
03:51:18,480 --> 03:51:23,360
14 hours since starting police duty

8209
03:51:24,220 --> 03:51:27,220
To the 5 members who are showing their exhaustion,

8210
03:51:26,430 --> 03:51:30,440
A Huge Incident That Rocks The Police Station!!

8211
03:51:27,220 --> 03:51:30,440
A huge incident that rocks the police station will occur

8212
03:51:34,060 --> 03:51:43,080
Emergency situation! A murder has occurred within the station

8213
03:51:34,060 --> 03:51:43,080

A murder has occurred in the police building. Gather at the auditorium!!

8218
03:51:48,960 --> 03:51:58,310
Emergency

8219
03:51:51,800 --> 03:51:54,860
What could've happened?

8220
03:51:52,260 --> 03:51:54,160
Inside of the police building?

8221
03:51:53,960 --> 03:51:55,650
Does this kind of thing really happen?

8222
03:51:56,380 --> 03:51:57,930
This again

8223
03:51:59,310 --> 03:52:04,720
Auditorium

8224
03:51:59,650 --> 03:52:04,100
There are chairs ahead, so please take a seat

8225
03:52:05,640 --> 03:52:10,990
All the police have gathered to a scene that invokes memories

8226
03:52:08,600 --> 03:52:10,500
Over here

8227
03:52:17,540 --> 03:52:19,600
What is this?

8228
03:52:20,740 --> 03:52:23,580
The pattern is the same as usual but...

8229
03:52:23,360 --> 03:52:24,930
Just now, at our police station

8230
03:52:24,930 --> 03:52:28,780
we have received news that the murderer of a wealthy family has escaped our police station

8231
03:52:25,090 --> 03:52:28,910
Daikichi Hakata

8232
03:52:25,090 --> 03:52:28,910
Police Chief

8233
03:52:29,190 --> 03:52:31,510
I will now try to find the killer among you

8234
03:52:32,420 --> 03:52:34,180
In the case that we do find the killer, then we will carry out the punishment on the spot

8235
03:52:34,180 --> 03:52:39,220
In the case that we do find the killer, then we will carry out the punishment on the spot

8236
03:52:37,520 --> 03:52:39,300
And the punishment is this...

8237
03:52:47,540 --> 03:52:47,610
Stunning Slap Machine, Chono-kun

8238
03:52:47,610 --> 03:52:47,670

8242
03:52:47,870 --> 03:52:51,910
Stunning Slap Machine, Chono-kun

8243
03:52:51,930 --> 03:52:52,720
I see

8244
03:52:53,150 --> 03:52:53,880
To see just how hard this machine can slap

8245
03:52:53,880 --> 03:52:55,610
To see just how hard this machine can slap

8246
03:52:54,490 --> 03:52:56,360
He looks so relieved

8247
03:52:55,780 --> 03:52:58,450
Let's have you watch

8248
03:52:57,360 --> 03:52:59,260
Please bring that in

8249
03:53:00,450 --> 03:53:02,450
Well, it's just as an example

8250
03:53:02,420 --> 03:53:09,220
Experimental slap on the Hosei dummy to test its power

8251
03:53:03,700 --> 03:53:05,880
A dummy named, "Hosei-kun"

8252
03:53:05,880 --> 03:53:09,210
We will use this Hosei-kun for the slap

8253
03:53:09,560 --> 03:53:09,630
Stunning Slap Machine Chono-kun, what kind of power does it possess?!

03:53:14,950 --> 03:53:23,070
Countdown for the Slap Machine Chono-kun

8260
03:53:22,520 --> 03:53:23,070
Go!

8261
03:53:30,530 --> 03:53:33,120
The culprit will get a slap like this

8262
03:53:34,100 --> 03:53:35,330
You understand, right?

8263
03:53:37,680 --> 03:53:37,990
Now let's begin the search for the criminal

8264
03:53:37,990 --> 03:53:39,990
Now let's begin the search for the criminal

8265
03:53:40,090 --> 03:53:41,370

What the hell do you think you're doing?

8281
03:53:54,610 --> 03:53:56,650
Well, with the Slap Machine...

8282
03:53:56,650 --> 03:53:58,240
Well, um, this year, Chono-san...

8283
03:53:57,690 --> 03:53:59,200
A Slap Machine!? Don't mess with me, you bastard!

8284
03:53:59,890 --> 03:54:00,380
Chono-san, it's because you said "I will not slap anymore"

8285
03:54:00,380 --> 03:54:02,560
Chono-san, it's because you said "I will not slap anymore"

8286
03:54:03,920 --> 03:54:06,310
It was lip service

8287
03:54:08,840 --> 03:54:09,930
No, no, no, no

8288
03:54:09,940 --> 03:54:11,620
No, no, no, no

8289
03:54:12,970 --> 03:54:14,440
It ended with just 1 sentence

8290
03:54:14,440 --> 03:54:16,440
No, no, no, no

8291
03:54:14,600 --> 03:54:21,120
Friday September 22nd Issue

8292
03:54:14,600 --> 03:54:21,120
It was all lip service

8293
03:54:21,560 --> 03:54:23,860
Just with those words, it has all been taken back

8294
03:54:23,140 --> 03:54:23,850
What the hell

8295
03:54:23,860 --> 03:54:25,280
Hey you, explain this

8296
03:54:25,280 --> 03:54:27,460
Then I will explain it from the beginning

8297
03:54:27,940 --> 03:54:29,640
There was a brutal incident in which all members of a wealthy family were murdered

8298
03:54:29,640 --> 03:54:32,440
There was a brutal incident in which all members of a wealthy family were murdered

8299
03:54:32,720 --> 03:54:35,870
Unfortunately, there are no survivors

8300
03:54:35,080 --> 03:54:35,520
However,

8301
03:54:36,060 --> 03:54:37,540
The family's

8302
03:54:37,550 --> 03:54:39,120
beloved dog, Dolphin-chan, was the only one unharmed

8303
03:54:39,120 --> 03:54:39,980
beloved dog, Dolphin-chan, was the only one unharmed

8304
03:54:40,160 --> 03:54:41,290
It most certainly remembers the smell of the culprit

8305
03:54:41,290 --> 03:54:43,350
It most certainly remembers the smell of the culprit

8306
03:54:43,520 --> 03:54:50,920
The beloved pet dog, Dolphin-chan, was at the crime scene and remembers the smell of the culprit

8307
03:54:43,850 --> 03:54:50,920
The murder of a wealthy family

8308
03:54:47,920 --> 03:54:52,100
If Dolphin-chan smells the culprit, without exception

8309
03:54:52,100 --> 03:54:53,460
she should bark!!

8310
03:54:53,590 --> 03:54:58,490
If she smells the culprit, she will bark!!

8311
03:54:54,240 --> 03:54:57,210
Let's bring Dolphin-chan out here for everyone

8312
03:55:01,040 --> 03:55:04,670
Beloved dog of the wealthy family

8313
03:55:01,040 --> 03:55:04,670
Dolphin-chan

8314
03:55:01,610 --> 03:55:03,980
Chono-san, please take the lead from here on

8315
03:55:03,000 --> 03:55:04,560
I got it

8316
03:55:04,920 --> 03:55:06,820
Hey!! You guys understand the situation, right?

8317
03:55:04,920 --> 03:55:10,970
Investigation to find the culprit among the policemen START

8318
03:55:11,050 --> 03:55:13,010
You fools, take out your notebooks

8319
03:55:13,010 --> 03:55:14,510
You fools, take out your notebooks

8320
03:55:15,170 --> 03:55:17,110
It's in your damn pockets

8321
03:55:17,510 --> 03:55:24,590
A police notebook has been inserted into their pockets

8322
03:55:18,570 --> 03:55:19,320
Take out your notebooks

8323
03:55:25,080 --> 03:55:31,300
Confirmation through smelling notebooks
If Dolphin barks, then that must be the culprit!!

8324
03:55:25,650 --> 03:55:31,300
She will smell all 5 of their notebooks. If Dolphin-chan barks, then that person must be the culprit!

8325
03:55:31,810 --> 03:55:33,090
Tanaka, give me your notebook

8326
03:55:33,090 --> 03:55:35,130
Tanaka, give me your notebook

8327
03:55:35,250 --> 03:55:36,400
Are you okay?

8328
03:55:36,400 --> 03:55:37,170
Yes sir

8329
03:55:39,740 --> 03:55:40,730
Let's find the truth

8330
03:55:48,390 --> 03:55:53,360
Is the culprit you, Tanaka?!

8331
03:55:51,860 --> 03:55:53,360
Tanaka?!

8332
03:55:53,430 --> 03:55:55,250
It's not

8333
03:55:56,840 --> 03:55:58,060
No reaction!!

8334
03:55:58,060 --> 03:55:59,000
No reaction!!

8335
03:55:59,140 --> 03:56:01,140
Tanaka is innocent

8336
03:56:03,940 --> 03:56:04,830
Endo

8337
03:56:07,660 --> 03:56:08,860
Could it be you?

8338
03:56:08,980 --> 03:56:09,520
It's not

8339
03:56:09,760 --> 03:56:10,280
No?

8340
03:56:14,390 --> 03:56:18,580
Is the culprit you?!

8341
03:56:16,280 --> 03:56:18,580
you?!

8342
03:56:17,580 --> 03:56:18,580
It's not

8343
03:56:20,190 --> 03:56:21,520
No reaction!!

8344
03:56:21,520 --> 03:56:22,550
No reaction!!

8345
03:56:22,780 --> 03:56:24,040
Thank you very much

8346
03:56:22,780 --> 03:56:24,910
Endo is also innocent

8347
03:56:29,240 --> 03:56:30,020
Are you okay?

8348
03:56:30,080 --> 03:56:30,780
Yes

8349
03:56:30,810 --> 03:56:31,520
Honestly?

8350
03:56:31,520 --> 03:56:32,760
Yes

8351
03:56:37,380 --> 03:56:40,500
Is the culprit you?!

8352
03:56:39,340 --> 03:56:40,510
you?!

8353
03:56:40,510 --> 03:56:41,130
It's not

8354
03:56:44,150 --> 03:56:45,380
No reaction!!

8355
03:56:45,380 --> 03:56:46,840
No reaction!!

8356
03:56:47,000 --> 03:56:49,730
Hamada is also innocent

8357
03:56:47,540 --> 03:56:48,860
You two are left

8358
03:56:49,770 --> 03:56:51,520
Matsumoto, let me borrow your notebook

8359
03:56:51,520 --> 03:56:52,620
Matsumoto, let me borrow your notebook

8360
03:56:53,660 --> 03:56:58,850
Touching Matsumoto with his notebook

8361
03:56:57,120 --> 03:56:58,350
What are you doing?

8362
03:57:03,130 --> 03:57:07,100
Is the culprit you, Matsumoto!?

8363
03:57:06,060 --> 03:57:07,100
Matsumoto?!

8364
03:57:07,260 --> 03:57:08,600
It's not

8365
03:57:12,290 --> 03:57:15,630
The culprit is Matsumoto?!

8366
03:57:18,260 --> 03:57:19,560
Stop it already

8367
03:57:22,500 --> 03:57:23,600
It came from Dolphin-chan herself

8368
03:57:23,600 --> 03:57:24,840
Just a minute...

8369
03:57:27,220 --> 03:57:30,020
Were you a the crime scene?

8370
03:57:28,280 --> 03:57:30,200
I wasn't. I truly was not

8371
03:57:30,460 --> 03:57:31,920
Hosei-kun was rubbing his notebook on me

8372
03:57:31,920 --> 03:57:35,590
Hosei-kun was rubbing his notebook on me

8373
03:57:35,200 --> 03:57:35,560
Hey!

8374
03:57:35,600 --> 03:57:36,790
Do him in, please!!

8375
03:57:36,790 --> 03:57:37,640
Before that

8376
03:57:38,040 --> 03:57:40,560
I will check (Hosei) too to confirm

8377
03:57:39,140 --> 03:57:40,300
Yes, please do that

8378
03:57:40,890 --> 03:57:41,700
Alright, sit down.

8379
03:57:42,240 --> 03:57:43,010
But wait...

8380
03:57:45,380 --> 03:57:47,700
Dogs always tell the truth

8381
03:57:51,840 --> 03:57:56,980
The culprit is you, Hosei, isn't it?!

8382
03:57:55,680 --> 03:57:56,970
No, it's Matsumoto!!

8383
03:57:55,880 --> 03:57:56,980
isn't it?!

8384
03:57:57,160 --> 03:57:57,210
It's Matsumoto!!

8385
03:57:57,210 --> 03:57:57,280
It's Matsumoto!!

8386
03:57:57,280 --> 03:57:57,350
It's Matsumoto!!

8387
03:57:57,350 --> 03:57:57,410
It's Matsumoto!!

8388
03:57:57,410 --> 03:57:59,850
It's Matsumoto!!

8389
03:58:00,040 --> 03:58:01,340
Dolphin, is it wrong?

8390
03:58:01,390 --> 03:58:06,930
Dolphin-chan won't bark...

8391
03:58:02,970 --> 03:58:03,930
Dolphin?

8392
03:58:07,280 --> 03:58:08,190
It's you!! Isn't it?

8393
03:58:08,190 --> 03:58:09,230
It's you!! Isn't it?

8394
03:58:09,230 --> 03:58:11,090
But it barked when it came to Matsumoto

8395
03:58:11,090 --> 03:58:12,860
But it barked when it came to Matsumoto

8396
03:58:13,200 --> 03:58:17,170
Dolphin-chan... It's not true, right?

8397
03:58:17,400 --> 03:58:18,180
It's Matsumoto!!

8398
03:58:17,470 --> 03:58:22,630
By default, Dolphin-chan should be barking at Hosei...

8399
03:58:18,000 --> 03:58:22,620
Following the usual pattern Dolphin-chan is supposed to bark at Hosei

8400
03:58:22,710 --> 03:58:27,300
Instead, Matsumoto is barked at in this strange turn of events!

8401
03:58:28,930 --> 03:58:36,610
In the chaos of the scene the atmosphere has grown tense and unnerving

8402
03:58:30,860 --> 03:58:31,640
It's not you?

8403
03:58:31,640 --> 03:58:32,280
It's not

8404
03:58:35,220 --> 03:58:36,180
This kind of thing can happen too

8405
03:58:36,180 --> 03:58:36,700
Yes

8406
03:58:39,180 --> 03:58:39,850
Alright

8407
03:58:40,300 --> 03:58:41,930
Matsumoto, get up on stage!!

8408
03:58:41,930 --> 03:58:44,260
Matsumoto, get up on stage!!

8409
03:58:46,020 --> 03:58:46,920
For real?

8410
03:58:46,050 --> 03:58:50,440
In the unexpected twist Daikichi appears

8411
03:58:47,580 --> 03:58:50,200
Matsumoto, those things can happen

8412
03:58:51,050 --> 03:58:53,840
Chono-san, please do what you need to do with Matsumoto-san

8413
03:58:54,000 --> 03:58:55,060
Are you prepared?

8414
03:58:55,060 --> 03:58:57,860
Bu-... Wha... What is it?

8415
03:58:58,180 --> 03:59:02,280
Even things beyond imagination can happen...

8416
03:59:01,570 --> 03:59:02,340
Imagination.

8417
03:59:02,340 --> 03:59:02,850
It's important that we go with the flow

8418
03:59:02,850 --> 03:59:04,920
It's important that we go with the flow

8419
03:59:04,920 --> 03:59:09,380
Dolphin-chan barked,
so the slap goes to Matsumoto!!

8420
03:59:10,210 --> 03:59:11,220
Seriously?

8421
03:59:11,410 --> 03:59:12,450
This is wrong, right?

8422
03:59:17,030 --> 03:59:17,910
But it was really...

8423
03:59:18,930 --> 03:59:22,100
This can't be helped!!

8424
03:59:20,640 --> 03:59:21,560
No no, this can't be right

8425
03:59:22,100 --> 03:59:23,400
But it can't be helped!!

8426
03:59:23,400 --> 03:59:26,400
For starters please go up there

8427
03:59:25,760 --> 03:59:26,520
Please

8428
03:59:26,520 --> 03:59:31,670
Going with the flow and continuing
with the slap punishment!!

8429
03:59:33,720 --> 03:59:34,310
Matsumoto

8430
03:59:34,710 --> 03:59:36,750
Wait Chono-san, let's confirm once more...

8431
03:59:37,250 --> 03:59:39,380
The dog can't help it

8432
03:59:39,650 --> 03:59:40,980
The dog reacted to your smell!!

8433
03:59:40,980 --> 03:59:43,820
The dog reacted to your smell!!

8434
03:59:42,680 --> 03:59:43,810
Do you understand?

8435
03:59:45,160 --> 03:59:50,010
You say, "The dog can't help it,"
but I don't understand why that's the reason...

8436
03:59:46,440 --> 03:59:50,010
but I don't understand why that's the reason...

8437
03:59:54,360 --> 03:59:57,300
You can't weasel out of it Matsumoto. It's impossible

8438
03:59:54,370 --> 03:59:57,300
It can't be helped

8439
03:59:57,300 --> 03:59:59,190
I'm sweating

8440
04:00:02,310 --> 04:00:04,290
We were all examined though

8441
04:00:04,050 --> 04:00:04,660
Wait really...

8442
04:00:04,660 --> 04:00:06,840
That's right

8443
04:00:06,840 --> 04:00:08,840
We didn't know who it would bark at

8444
04:00:09,250 --> 04:00:11,310
Wh-

8445
04:00:09,580 --> 04:00:11,310
wh-

8446
04:00:09,750 --> 04:00:11,310
wh-

8447
04:00:09,980 --> 04:00:11,310
what will you do?

8448
04:00:11,580 --> 04:00:13,280
The same as I do every year

8449
04:00:13,480 --> 04:00:16,120
Are you being for real right now?

8450
04:00:14,160 --> 04:00:15,250
You always anticipate this

8451
04:00:15,510 --> 04:00:17,510
But this is different from usual

8452
04:00:17,520 --> 04:00:19,720
What the hell are you doing with your hands?

8453
04:00:19,650 --> 04:00:21,160
What is it that you are always looking forward to?

8454
04:00:25,350 --> 04:00:26,120
That's right

8455
04:00:28,630 --> 04:00:30,970
Seriously, please just accept it!!

8456
04:00:31,460 --> 04:00:33,350
But Chono-san, I...

8457
04:00:33,350 --> 04:00:34,340
Eh!! I don't know if this is for real, but

8458
04:00:34,340 --> 04:00:35,970
Eh!! I don't know if this is for real, but

8459
04:00:36,270 --> 04:00:38,010
Because this is unexpected, there are years when it'd turn out like this

8460
04:00:37,440 --> 04:00:38,610
Unexpected indeed...

8461
04:00:38,010 --> 04:00:40,410
Because this is unexpected, there are years when it'd turn out like this

8462
04:00:40,450 --> 04:00:42,420
Alright, come here

8463
04:00:42,420 --> 04:00:44,420
You will be fine, Matsumoto

8464
04:00:44,490 --> 04:00:46,010
PYAH!!!

8465
04:00:45,060 --> 04:00:46,020
You'll be fine

8466
04:00:46,020 --> 04:00:46,890
My ears rung!!

8467
04:00:46,890 --> 04:00:48,000
My ears are ringing!!

8468
04:00:48,000 --> 04:00:49,860
It really hurt

8469
04:00:49,290 --> 04:00:52,150
My ears were ringing just now!!

8470
04:01:00,060 --> 04:01:02,200
Wait really, ehh... Is this real?

8471
04:01:02,790 --> 04:01:04,960
Wow, that's amazing!!

8472
04:01:05,250 --> 04:01:07,500
Prepare yourself!!

8473
04:01:06,310 --> 04:01:07,700
Be a man!!

8474
04:01:10,040 --> 04:01:11,340
Wait, it's coming for real, right?

8475
04:01:11,340 --> 04:01:12,010
It's coming!! It's definitely coming!!

8476
04:01:12,010 --> 04:01:13,010
It's coming!! It's definitely coming!!

8477
04:01:12,850 --> 04:01:15,440
Stay right here

8478
04:01:15,440 --> 04:01:16,420
Show that you are a man

8479
04:01:16,580 --> 04:01:17,150
I know it, it's definitely coming for real

8480
04:01:17,150 --> 04:01:20,780
I know it, it's definitely coming for real

8481
04:01:20,950 --> 04:01:21,020
You are so noisy!!

8482
04:01:21,020 --> 04:01:21,080
You are so noisy!!

8483
04:01:21,080 --> 04:01:21,150
You are so noisy!!

8484
04:01:21,150 --> 04:01:21,220
You are so noisy!!

8485
04:01:21,220 --> 04:01:23,740
You are so noisy!!

8486
04:01:25,720 --> 04:01:27,160
It can't be helped

8487
04:01:30,470 --> 04:01:32,160
Chono-san, are you for real?

8488
04:01:32,600 --> 04:01:33,330
Matsumoto

8489
04:01:32,930 --> 04:01:34,730
Please!!

8490
04:01:35,000 --> 04:01:36,770
You got a complaint?!

8491
04:01:36,770 --> 04:01:37,670
No

8492
04:01:37,670 --> 04:01:38,920
Alright, since there aren't any...

8493
04:01:38,940 --> 04:01:40,240
You really are intending to do it!!

8494
04:01:40,240 --> 04:01:42,760
I can tell!!

8495
04:01:41,430 --> 04:01:42,910
Matsumoto!!

8496
04:01:42,060 --> 04:01:42,910
Yes?

8497
04:01:42,910 --> 04:01:45,900
Make up your mind and prepare!!

8498
04:01:44,040 --> 04:01:45,750
It's insanely hot

8499
04:01:48,150 --> 04:01:49,000
Prepare yourself

8500
04:01:49,450 --> 04:01:51,130
Close your mouth!!

8501
04:01:51,520 --> 04:01:55,840
At last, the moment of the slap punishment

8502
04:01:57,730 --> 04:01:59,270
I'm scared, so scared

8503
04:02:00,930 --> 04:02:02,610
Aaaaaaaaah!!

8504
04:02:03,810 --> 04:02:04,060
Scary

8505
04:02:04,060 --> 04:02:04,300
Scary

8506
04:02:04,300 --> 04:02:06,380
Scary

8507
04:02:04,660 --> 04:02:06,380
Please wait a moment!!

8508
04:02:06,830 --> 04:02:09,150
Hey!!

8509
04:02:07,630 --> 04:02:08,780
Excuse me

8510
04:02:09,750 --> 04:02:10,240
There has been a mistake

8511
04:02:10,240 --> 04:02:11,770
There has been a mistake

8512
04:02:12,050 --> 04:02:13,370
The dog from just now had absolutely

8513
04:02:13,370 --> 04:02:15,790
The dog from just now had absolutely

8514
04:02:14,220 --> 04:02:15,790
nothing to do with Dolphin-chan

8515
04:02:16,030 --> 04:02:17,340
What?!

8516
04:02:16,740 --> 04:02:17,690
I'm sorry

8517
04:02:17,960 --> 04:02:19,460
The real Dolphin-chan was in a different location

8518
04:02:19,460 --> 04:02:20,750
The real Dolphin-chan was in a different location

8519
04:02:20,900 --> 04:02:22,730
What's up with this?

8520
04:02:23,700 --> 04:02:25,530
This is the real one

8521
04:02:23,720 --> 04:02:28,100
Dolphin-chan (The real one)

8522
04:02:23,720 --> 04:02:28,100
The wealthy family's beloved dog

8523
04:02:26,100 --> 04:02:27,290
They look alike

8524
04:02:28,100 --> 04:02:29,920
Matsumoto go back

8525
04:02:29,920 --> 04:02:31,170
Matsumoto go back

8526
04:02:31,270 --> 04:02:36,710
Matsumoto barely avoids a slap

8527
04:02:31,490 --> 04:02:33,030
That was scary

8528
04:02:34,940 --> 04:02:36,050
That was scary

8529
04:02:36,960 --> 04:02:40,580
The investigation begins once again with the real Dolphin-chan

8530
04:02:37,150 --> 04:02:44,620
Handbook scent confirmation to be repeated

8531
04:02:37,150 --> 04:02:44,620
If the real Dolphin-chan barks, then that is the culprit!!

8532
04:02:41,080 --> 04:02:44,200
Now for real, the one which is howled at is the culprit

8533
04:02:45,300 --> 04:02:46,170
Tanaka

8534
04:02:46,170 --> 04:02:46,870
Yes

8535
04:02:48,440 --> 04:02:49,540
Are you okay?

8536
04:02:49,890 --> 04:02:51,490
It isn't me

8537
04:02:53,060 --> 04:02:57,620
Are you the culprit, Tanaka!?

8538
04:02:56,120 --> 04:02:57,620
Tanaka!?

8539
04:02:57,620 --> 04:02:58,480
It's not me!!

8540
04:03:00,950 --> 04:03:02,760
No reaction!!

8541
04:03:02,760 --> 04:03:05,040
Tanaka is innocent

8542
04:03:05,040 --> 04:03:10,610
And then, there was also no reaction to Endo and Hamada's handbooks

8543
04:03:05,040 --> 04:03:12,430
Endo and Hamada's handbooks also give no reaction

8544
04:03:10,610 --> 04:03:11,880
No reaction!!

8545
04:03:12,580 --> 04:03:16,140
2 people are left

8546
04:03:18,620 --> 04:03:19,970
Are you okay?

8547
04:03:18,950 --> 04:03:20,060
Yes

8548
04:03:23,440 --> 04:03:25,950
You're so desparate, Macchan

8549
04:03:23,480 --> 04:03:24,790
You were not at the scene of the crime?

8550
04:03:24,790 --> 04:03:25,560
I was not

8551
04:03:25,960 --> 04:03:28,110
T/N: Hosei is trying to get the dog to bark.

8552
04:03:25,960 --> 04:03:28,110
shoo!!

8553
04:03:28,780 --> 04:03:30,930
shoo!!

8554
04:03:31,080 --> 04:03:31,220
shoo!!

8555
04:03:31,220 --> 04:03:33,600
shshii!!

8556
04:03:33,850 --> 04:03:40,240
Are you the culprit, Matsumoto!?

8557
04:03:38,790 --> 04:03:40,240
Matsumoto!?

8558
04:03:40,240 --> 04:03:41,690
I am not

8559
04:03:45,080 --> 04:03:47,080
No reaction!!

8560
04:03:47,080 --> 04:03:47,880
No reaction!!

8561
04:03:47,880 --> 04:03:50,900
Matsumoto is innocent

8562
04:03:51,150 --> 04:03:53,470
You're the only one left

8563
04:03:55,370 --> 04:03:56,790
Hand over your handbook

8564
04:03:56,790 --> 04:03:59,160
Hand over your handbook

8565
04:04:03,520 --> 04:04:05,680
The dog doesn't lie

8566
04:04:05,780 --> 04:04:10,570
Are you the culprit, Hosei!?

8567
04:04:09,770 --> 04:04:10,570
Hosei!?

8568
04:04:10,570 --> 04:04:11,740
I am not!!

8569
04:04:17,160 --> 04:04:21,330
Why is she barking that much!?

8570
04:04:24,850 --> 04:04:26,270
She barked a ton

8571
04:04:26,270 --> 04:04:28,490
Why did she bark that much!?

8572
04:04:27,810 --> 04:04:30,390
Dolphin barked a ton

8573
04:04:31,790 --> 04:04:40,950
The real culprit  was Tsukitei Hosei!!

8574
04:04:31,790 --> 04:04:40,950
The wealthy family murder case

8575
04:04:36,070 --> 04:04:37,780
That was dangerous

8576
04:04:37,620 --> 04:04:38,900
That hurt

8577
04:04:39,100 --> 04:04:40,040
Chono-san

8578
04:04:40,350 --> 04:04:41,150
What is it?

8579
04:04:41,300 --> 04:04:42,220
Friday... I read through all of it

8580
04:04:42,220 --> 04:04:43,720
Friday... I read through all of it

8581
04:04:44,160 --> 04:04:45,070
In response to Hino-san's scandal, physical punishments...

8582
04:04:45,070 --> 04:04:46,340
In response to Hino-san's scandal, physical punishments...

8583
04:04:46,340 --> 04:04:48,440
Shut up

8584
04:04:54,480 --> 04:04:55,600
Shut up

8585
04:04:56,190 --> 04:04:57,850
He doesn't even let you talk

8586
04:04:59,960 --> 04:05:02,290
If he does that you can't say anything

8587
04:05:02,290 --> 04:05:05,310
He doesn't even let you talk

8588
04:05:04,240 --> 04:05:05,110
Hosei

8589
04:05:05,640 --> 04:05:07,650
First of all, stand up!!

8590
04:05:11,020 --> 04:05:12,690
It has to be you, understand?

8591
04:05:12,690 --> 04:05:13,690
It has to be you, understand?

8592
04:05:14,100 --> 04:05:16,320
I read the magazine

8593
04:05:16,320 --> 04:05:19,590
And talked about it on many shows

8594
04:05:19,640 --> 04:05:20,940
Shut up, you bastard!!

8595
04:05:20,940 --> 04:05:22,950
#Δ%□☆※♂

8596
04:05:22,950 --> 04:05:24,560
π▽☆Φ◇Σ#

8597
04:05:31,100 --> 04:05:32,650
It's impossible

8598
04:05:33,510 --> 04:05:34,660
It's impossible

8599
04:05:37,530 --> 04:05:39,750
I've had enough

8600
04:05:39,510 --> 04:05:41,380
He said it himself though

8601
04:05:41,380 --> 04:05:42,480
Go up

8602
04:05:43,080 --> 04:05:46,000
There's no way it could be lip service

8603
04:05:46,290 --> 04:05:48,000
This punishment is scary

8604
04:05:48,400 --> 04:05:49,570
Are you ready?

8605
04:05:49,570 --> 04:05:50,970
He is scary

8606
04:05:50,510 --> 04:05:53,230
What do you mean, am I ready?

8607
04:05:53,230 --> 04:05:55,260
It was written that you wouldn't do a slap this year

8608
04:05:55,260 --> 04:05:57,260
And I talked about it in many other shows

8609
04:05:57,860 --> 04:05:58,960
It's all lip service

8610
04:05:58,960 --> 04:05:59,110
What the hell is that!!

8611
04:05:59,110 --> 04:05:59,280
What the hell is that!!

8612
04:05:59,280 --> 04:06:01,130
What the hell is that!!

8613
04:06:12,540 --> 04:06:13,860
He asked it so casually, "What the hell is that!!"

8614
04:06:13,860 --> 04:06:16,530
He asked it so casually, "What the hell is that!!"

8615
04:06:17,080 --> 04:06:20,550
This year, it's all you

8616
04:06:19,000 --> 04:06:20,550
This year, it's all you

8617
04:06:20,640 --> 04:06:23,170
Wait wait wait a second Chono-san

8618
04:06:24,460 --> 04:06:26,140
I understand that I will get slapped

8619
04:06:26,440 --> 04:06:28,040
1 month ago, I got something called Temporomandibular dysfunction

8620
04:06:28,040 --> 04:06:30,460
1 month ago, I got something called Temporomandibular dysfunction

8621
04:06:30,460 --> 04:06:30,950
What's that?

8622
04:06:31,210 --> 04:06:32,130
I got it

8623
04:06:32,430 --> 04:06:33,830
Really, I was told it's really not good

8624
04:06:32,780 --> 04:06:34,300
You didn't get it

8625
04:06:33,830 --> 04:06:35,050
Really, I was told it's really not good

8626
04:06:35,080 --> 04:06:35,900
Eh!? That's a lie

8627
04:06:35,900 --> 04:06:37,200
Eh!? That's a lie

8628
04:06:38,670 --> 04:06:39,370
Which is it?

8629
04:06:39,370 --> 04:06:41,720
He's just saying it with no proof

8630
04:06:41,820 --> 04:06:42,640
Wait a moment please

8631
04:06:42,640 --> 04:06:43,690
I looked it up on the internet properly

8632
04:06:43,690 --> 04:06:44,540
I looked it up on the internet properly

8633
04:06:44,540 --> 04:06:47,860
I looked it up on the internet and it makes

8634
04:06:45,560 --> 04:06:45,740
popping

8635
04:06:45,740 --> 04:06:45,910
popping

8636
04:06:45,910 --> 04:06:47,860
popping

8637
04:06:45,960 --> 04:06:47,900
sounds right here

8638
04:06:53,900 --> 04:06:55,050
It's the truth

8639
04:06:56,420 --> 04:06:57,110
That's what he says

8640
04:07:01,340 --> 04:07:02,910
That has nothing to do with being slapped, you understand?

8641
04:07:02,910 --> 04:07:03,600
That has nothing to do with being slapped, you understand?

8642
04:07:03,600 --> 04:07:04,460
It'll heal with one slap from me

8643
04:07:04,460 --> 04:07:06,670
It'll heal with one slap from me

8644
04:07:04,880 --> 04:07:06,670
No, that's...

8645
04:07:06,830 --> 04:07:08,650
It's making knocking sounds right

8646
04:07:07,770 --> 04:07:07,870
Popping sounds

8647
04:07:07,870 --> 04:07:07,970
Popping sounds

8648
04:07:07,970 --> 04:07:09,740
Popping sounds

8649
04:07:08,650 --> 04:07:08,750
Popping sounds right

8650
04:07:08,750 --> 04:07:08,850
Popping sounds right

8651
04:07:08,850 --> 04:07:09,740
Popping sounds right

8652
04:07:09,800 --> 04:07:14,620
For the culprit the punishment slap!!

8653
04:07:14,820 --> 04:07:15,290
I'll just take it!!

8654
04:07:15,290 --> 04:07:17,180
I'll just take it!!

8655
04:07:15,990 --> 04:07:17,540
You're being truthful

8656
04:07:17,180 --> 04:07:19,240
But let me ask you for just one thing

8657
04:07:18,410 --> 04:07:19,240
What?

8658
04:07:20,010 --> 04:07:21,760
That blonde guy, please give him one slap as well

8659
04:07:21,760 --> 04:07:24,480
That blonde guy, please give him one slap as well

8660
04:07:24,480 --> 04:07:26,000
What the hell is he doing!!

8661
04:07:28,870 --> 04:07:30,320
That is unthinkable

8662
04:07:31,220 --> 04:07:33,040
He said it so straight up

8663
04:07:32,930 --> 04:07:34,390
He said something amazing

8664
04:07:34,190 --> 04:07:35,090
Why?!

8665
04:07:39,130 --> 04:07:40,470
Why should I hit Matsumoto?

8666
04:07:40,470 --> 04:07:42,730
Why should I hit Matsumoto?

8667
04:07:41,070 --> 04:07:42,730
Since he was barked at

8668
04:07:42,730 --> 04:07:43,950
The first Dolphin-chan barked at him

8669
04:07:43,950 --> 04:07:44,920
The first Dolphin-chan barked at him

8670
04:07:45,150 --> 04:07:45,570
That was the wrong Dolphin-chan

8671
04:07:45,570 --> 04:07:46,920
That was the wrong Dolphin-chan

8672
04:07:46,920 --> 04:07:48,590
It was the same one!! Tell the truth!!

8673
04:07:48,890 --> 04:07:49,840
That was a different Dolphin-chan

8674
04:07:49,840 --> 04:07:52,660
Tell the truth, you bastard!!

8675
04:07:52,660 --> 04:07:54,610
Tell the truth?

8676
04:07:56,730 --> 04:07:59,750
How can he say that...

8677
04:08:03,160 --> 04:08:04,060
Hosei, he has nothing to do with it

8678
04:08:04,060 --> 04:08:05,740
Hosei, he has nothing to do with it

8679
04:08:05,740 --> 04:08:06,630
You are the culprit, do you understand?

8680
04:08:06,630 --> 04:08:09,160
You are the culprit, do you understand?

8681
04:08:09,160 --> 04:08:10,210
OK!!

8682
04:08:10,800 --> 04:08:11,610
OK then, let's do a countdown

8683
04:08:11,610 --> 04:08:13,070
OK then, let's do a countdown

8684
04:08:14,370 --> 04:08:16,940
Ouch...

8685
04:08:17,690 --> 04:08:18,800
Stand up straight

8686
04:08:19,720 --> 04:08:21,420
Shall we start from 5 or shall we start from 3?

8687
04:08:21,420 --> 04:08:23,290
Shall we start from 5 or shall we start from 3?

8688
04:08:23,290 --> 04:08:24,580
Which?

8689
04:08:25,260 --> 04:08:29,980
Please start from 5!!

8690
04:08:33,540 --> 04:08:35,440
Why did he say it like that?

8691
04:08:35,100 --> 04:08:38,370
It sounds like he is asking to be slapped!!

8692
04:08:39,940 --> 04:08:40,940
Don't run away

8693
04:08:41,590 --> 04:08:42,110
Finally, the moment of the slap

8694
04:08:42,110 --> 04:08:47,230
Finally, the moment of the slap

8695
04:08:45,930 --> 04:08:46,880
Let's go

8696
04:08:56,190 --> 04:08:56,430
SMACK

8697
04:08:58,090 --> 04:09:00,860
The punishment slap

8698
04:08:58,440 --> 04:08:59,140
SMACK

8699
04:08:58,540 --> 04:08:58,660
explodes!!

8700
04:08:58,660 --> 04:08:58,740
explodes!!

8701
04:08:58,740 --> 04:08:58,810
explodes!!

8702
04:08:58,810 --> 04:08:58,860
explodes!!

8703
04:08:58,860 --> 04:09:00,860
explodes!!

8704
04:09:02,830 --> 04:09:05,380
GOD

8705
04:09:03,480 --> 04:09:05,380
DAMN!!

8706
04:09:05,130 --> 04:09:06,400
Even if he says that...

8707
04:09:14,640 --> 04:09:19,030
It's over now.

8708
04:09:16,610 --> 04:09:19,030
Let's go

8709
04:09:22,280 --> 04:09:25,000
Really, saying my name

8710
04:09:31,190 --> 04:09:32,210
That one hurt

8711
04:09:33,850 --> 04:09:38,680
As the night deepens, trouble within the police station rapidly increases

8712
04:09:35,260 --> 04:09:38,900
15 hours of police duty elapsed

8713
04:09:40,500 --> 04:09:41,870
Everyone, it's bad

8714
04:09:42,270 --> 04:09:43,970
A very violent gang have barricaded themselves in

8715
04:09:43,970 --> 04:09:45,370
A very violent gang have barricaded themselves in

8716
04:09:45,840 --> 04:09:48,040
They are about to engage in a  bloody confrontation
with the  police who are trying to shut them down

8717
04:09:48,040 --> 04:09:49,210
They are about to engage in a  bloody confrontation
with the police who are trying to shut them down

8718
04:09:49,210 --> 04:09:50,710
They are about to engage in a  bloody confrontation
with the police who are trying to shut them down

8719
04:09:50,900 --> 04:09:53,580
It's about time for that, yeah

8720
04:09:51,830 --> 04:09:53,330
Can you go and calm the situation down?

8721
04:09:53,720 --> 04:09:59,810
Confrontation between the gang and the police

8722
04:09:53,720 --> 04:09:59,810
The 5 members go to suppress the fight!!

8723
04:09:56,300 --> 04:09:57,450
It's a confrontation, huh

8724
04:09:57,450 --> 04:09:59,450
Even if we go, it's not like we can do anything

8725
04:10:00,560 --> 04:10:01,460
Let's get on

8726
04:10:03,040 --> 04:10:07,500
The 5 members get on the bus and head to suppress the fighting

8727
04:10:03,140 --> 04:10:07,850
The 5 members get on the bus
and head straight to the gang's hideout

8728
04:10:08,210 --> 04:10:14,600
What lies in wait for them are those same guys

8729
04:10:08,530 --> 04:10:12,830
What lies in wait for them are, as always, those guys

8730
04:10:15,000 --> 04:10:16,720
Gang and police

8731
04:10:15,170 --> 04:10:20,190
Gang hideout

8732
04:10:16,820 --> 04:10:18,570
The police will have to win

8733
04:10:18,570 --> 04:10:20,190
Of course

8734
04:10:20,190 --> 04:10:23,810
You're too slow!

8735
04:10:22,290 --> 04:10:22,360
This is a forced eviction, you bastard

8736
04:10:22,360 --> 04:10:22,410
This is a forced eviction, you bastard

8737
04:10:22,410 --> 04:10:22,490
This is a forced eviction, you bastard

8738
04:10:22,490 --> 04:10:22,560
This is a forced eviction, you bastard

8739
04:10:22,560 --> 04:10:23,810
This is a forced eviction, you bastard

8740
04:10:24,160 --> 04:10:27,480
A blistering mood

8741
04:10:24,510 --> 04:10:27,480
Don't you go trying to take our place away from us

8742
04:10:27,480 --> 04:10:30,400
Hurry up and get out of here you losers!!

8743
04:10:31,970 --> 04:10:34,510
Hey you!!

8744
04:10:33,270 --> 04:10:34,510
Who the hell are you guys!?

8745
04:10:34,510 --> 04:10:34,990
Let's try to come to a peaceful solution

8746
04:10:34,990 --> 04:10:36,270
Let's try to come to a peaceful solution

8747
04:10:36,270 --> 04:10:37,340
Stop saying crap!

8748
04:10:37,680 --> 04:10:39,340
Shut up and watch!!

8749
04:10:39,610 --> 04:10:40,960
Have a seat over there and watch

8750
04:10:40,960 --> 04:10:42,910
Have a seat over there and watch

8751
04:10:42,910 --> 04:10:45,530
Hey, who are you getting mouthy at bastard?

8752
04:10:46,550 --> 04:10:48,850
This is our turf

8753
04:10:48,000 --> 04:10:48,920
That's right

8754
04:10:49,720 --> 04:10:51,560
What will you do?

8755
04:10:51,970 --> 04:10:53,830
Let's put our bodies on the line, you bastard!!

8756
04:10:53,830 --> 04:10:56,610
Sounds good!!

8757
04:10:54,930 --> 04:10:56,610
We'll match you!! Bring it on!!

8758
04:10:56,610 --> 04:10:59,030
Breakdown in amicable negotiations

8759
04:10:59,970 --> 04:11:07,110
Comedians with an average age of 46!

8760
04:10:59,970 --> 04:11:07,110
Let's go all out this year as well, comedians with an average age of 46 put themselves into a body-baring festival

8761
04:11:00,570 --> 04:11:07,110
In a battle for their pride,
they put their bodies on the line

8762
04:11:07,110 --> 04:11:07,670
This year, let's make sure to get the F viewer bracket as well

8763
04:11:07,570 --> 04:11:14,380
T/N: TV audiences are split into C, T, F and M brackets and age-ranges. F is for female viewers.

8764
04:11:07,670 --> 04:11:10,180
This year, let's make sure to get the F viewer bracket as well

8765
04:11:11,030 --> 04:11:16,310
Let's get started with the popular segment which

8766
04:11:12,710 --> 04:11:16,310
all the kids around the nation are waiting for!!

8767
04:11:16,310 --> 04:11:17,820
When they take off their clothes, you can't tell which is the gang...

8768
04:11:17,820 --> 04:11:21,650
When they take off their clothes, you can't tell which is the gang...

8769
04:11:21,650 --> 04:11:24,010
So we'll start it off first

8770
04:11:21,650 --> 04:11:24,570
Kendo Kobayashi

8771
04:11:21,650 --> 04:11:24,570
Ueshima team staff

8772
04:11:25,790 --> 04:11:25,840

Bring it in!!

8776
04:11:29,960 --> 04:11:32,210
It's the present of death

8777
04:11:32,210 --> 04:11:33,870
Present of death?

8778
04:11:34,030 --> 04:11:38,450
It's a competition of being given a toy,
and pretending to be joyful like a child for 60 seconds

8779
04:11:38,450 --> 04:11:41,510
It's a competition of being given a toy,
and pretending to be joyful like a child for 60 seconds

8780
04:11:41,710 --> 04:11:44,090
That's sophisticated

8781
04:11:49,310 --> 04:11:50,470
That's sophisticated, huh

8782
04:11:50,570 --> 04:11:57,820
Be given a toy present, and for 1 minute,
explosively express your joy like a child

8783
04:11:50,570 --> 04:11:57,820
Ueshima team's pride

8784
04:11:53,350 --> 04:11:54,890
Haranishi!

8785
04:11:53,900 --> 04:11:54,990
OK, I understand

8786
04:11:57,820 --> 04:11:59,520
Will you become my son?

8787
04:11:59,520 --> 04:12:00,630
Yes please!!

8788
04:12:00,190 --> 04:12:02,110

04:12:02,130 --> 04:12:02,990
Start!

8790
04:12:02,990 --> 04:12:05,210
Think about it

8791
04:12:04,460 --> 04:12:05,210
Huh?

8792
04:12:05,210 --> 04:12:07,500
Here, what do you think this is?

8793
04:12:05,960 --> 04:12:06,570
Oh! Papa, what's this?!

8844
04:12:24,420 --> 04:12:24,620
Papa!!

8845
04:12:24,620 --> 04:12:26,350
It's become a dance

8846
04:12:25,180 --> 04:12:26,350
Papa, thank you so much!

8847
04:12:26,350 --> 04:12:28,550
Kids won't do things like that

8848
04:12:28,550 --> 04:12:30,720
You have 25 seconds left

8849
04:12:29,770 --> 04:12:29,920
Papa!!

8850
04:12:29,920 --> 04:12:30,420
Papa!!

8851
04:12:30,460 --> 04:12:30,610
Papa!!

8852
04:12:30,610 --> 04:12:31,070
Papa!!

8853
04:12:30,720 --> 04:12:32,920
Hurry up and open it!!

8854
04:12:31,120 --> 04:12:31,270

8855
04:12:31,270 --> 04:12:31,720

Papa!!

8858
04:12:32,490 --> 04:12:32,670
Papa!!

8859
04:12:32,670 --> 04:12:32,920
Papa!!

8860
04:12:32,990 --> 04:12:33,430
Papa!!

8861
04:12:33,490 --> 04:12:33,930
Papa!!

8862
04:12:34,430 --> 04:12:35,890
He's stepping on it!!

8863
04:12:36,310 --> 04:12:39,830
Disqualified

8864
04:12:36,760 --> 04:12:37,610
That's the prize!

8865
04:12:39,850 --> 04:12:41,670
You ruined it

8866
04:12:42,800 --> 04:12:44,400
Haranishi's the greatest!

8867
04:12:47,910 --> 04:12:55,830
Degawa squad

8868
04:12:47,910 --> 04:12:55,830

"Hey, look there" showdown!!

8872
04:12:48,070 --> 04:12:55,830
Slow motion

8873
04:12:48,070 --> 04:12:55,830
T/N: "Hey, look there" is a variation of Rock, Paper, Scissors where the winner sings a chant and points in a direction and the loser has to look in a direction at the same time. If the loser looks at the same direction as the winner points, it's game over. Otherwise, you keep repeating.

8874
04:12:48,420 --> 04:12:55,830
Next up, Iwao and Tanaka will have a showdown via a tricky, slow motion game of "Hey, look there"

8875
04:12:56,080 --> 04:12:59,180
You just need to win!!

8876
04:12:57,300 --> 04:12:59,180
Right! Sorry!

8877
04:12:58,200 --> 04:12:59,180
Let's do it!

8878
04:13:02,650 --> 04:13:07,290
First is rock

8879
04:13:02,650 --> 04:13:07,290

First is rock

8883
04:13:09,710 --> 04:13:10,460
You lost

8884

Jan Ken Poi

8891
04:13:19,570 --> 04:13:22,690
Hey, look there

8892
04:13:22,690 --> 04:13:24,740
Hey, look there

8893
04:13:24,740 --> 04:13:27,050
Wait a minute

8894
04:13:27,050 --> 04:13:28,280
Okay!! Nice decision!!

8895
04:13:28,280 --> 04:13:29,710
Okay!! Nice decision!!

8896
04:13:29,730 --> 04:13:32,380

Jan Ken Poi

8901
04:13:34,250 --> 04:13:36,100
They sure can continue for a long time

8902
04:13:37,270 --> 04:13:40,780
Hey, look there

8903
04:13:39,740 --> 04:13:41,660
Decide already!!

8904
04:13:40,780 --> 04:13:44,700
Hey, look there

8905
04:13:42,540 --> 04:13:44,700
Do it properly!

8906
04:13:46,480 --> 04:13:49,530
Jan Ken

8907
04:13:46,480 --> 04:13:49,530
Jan Ken

8908
04:13:48,420 --> 04:13:49,530
You guys...

8909
04:13:49,530 --> 04:13:52,370
Poi

8910
04:13:49,530 --> 04:13:52,370
Poi

8911
04:13:50,950 --> 04:13:52,370
Don't show him where you're going to point

8912
04:13:52,370 --> 04:13:54,420
This will end, right?

8913
04:13:53,310 --> 04:13:56,170
Hey, look

8914
04:13:53,310 --> 04:13:56,170
Hey, look

8915
04:13:56,170 --> 04:13:59,340
there

8916
04:13:56,170 --> 04:13:59,340
there

8917
04:13:59,840 --> 04:14:02,530
Those expressions are infuriating

8918
04:14:00,400 --> 04:14:03,820
Jan Ken

8919
04:14:00,400 --> 04:14:03,820
Jan Ken

8920
04:14:03,820 --> 04:14:07,390
It's never-ending!!

8921
04:14:03,820 --> 04:14:07,390
Poi~~

8922
04:14:03,820 --> 04:14:07,390
Poi~~

8923
04:14:08,200 --> 04:14:10,420
It's a tie,

8924
04:14:08,200 --> 04:14:10,420
It's a tie,

8925
04:14:08,200 --> 04:14:10,420
No need to do a tie-breaker, idiots!!

8926
04:14:10,420 --> 04:14:13,260
right?

8927
04:14:10,420 --> 04:14:13,260
right?

8928
04:14:11,990 --> 04:14:13,240
Stop with the tie-breaker!!

8929
04:14:13,730 --> 04:14:18,730
It's a tie, right?

8930
04:14:13,730 --> 04:14:18,730
It's a tie, right?

8931
04:14:14,760 --> 04:14:15,790
This is where you should persevere!!

8932
04:14:15,790 --> 04:14:17,060
This is where you should persevere!!

8933
04:14:17,060 --> 04:14:19,970
What kind of battle is this?

8934
04:14:18,730 --> 04:14:21,020
Hey, look there

8935
04:14:18,730 --> 04:14:21,020
Hey, look there

8936
04:14:21,020 --> 04:14:23,740
Hey, look there

8937
04:14:21,020 --> 04:14:23,740
Hey, look there

8938
04:14:23,740 --> 04:14:24,340
These guys are even!!

8939
04:14:24,340 --> 04:14:27,570
These guys are even!!

8940
04:14:28,520 --> 04:14:30,580
It's going to end here??

8941
04:14:30,780 --> 04:14:33,450
They probably find it rather tiring

8942
04:14:33,710 --> 04:14:36,530
A draw

8943
04:14:34,750 --> 04:14:37,320
Bravo, you guys are enemies, but bravo

8944
04:14:37,320 --> 04:14:37,680
Great game!!

8945
04:14:37,680 --> 04:14:40,500
Great game!!

8946
04:14:38,130 --> 04:14:40,520
We'll continue with this kind of praiseworthy battles

8947
04:14:40,520 --> 04:14:41,200
That's a farce, a farce!!

8948
04:14:41,200 --> 04:14:42,620
That's a farce, a farce!!

8949
04:14:41,650 --> 04:14:44,170
A farce? You fools think you could do this?

8950
04:14:44,170 --> 04:14:44,370
Bring that in!!

8951
04:14:44,370 --> 04:14:44,520
Bring that in!!

8952
04:14:44,520 --> 04:14:44,670

Bring that in!!

8955
04:14:47,030 --> 04:14:49,010
Idiots

8956
04:14:47,530 --> 04:14:49,010
What are you bringing in?!

8957
04:14:48,210 --> 04:14:49,010
This is...

8958
04:14:49,310 --> 04:14:51,010
A contest where you stick fireworks to the ass and endure the pain

8959
04:14:51,010 --> 04:14:54,570
A contest where you stick fireworks to the ass and endure the pain

8960
04:14:54,570 --> 04:14:57,050
Someone who's confident about his ass,

8961
04:14:55,650 --> 04:14:55,780
leader!!

8962
04:14:55,780 --> 04:14:57,050
leader!!

8963
04:14:56,640 --> 04:14:59,370
All right, I'll show you my best!

8964
04:14:57,100 --> 04:15:00,220
Legendary reaction comedian: Degawa Tetsurou

8965
04:14:59,370 --> 04:15:01,170
Go! Go!

8966
04:15:02,610 --> 04:15:04,130
Hey, aren't you afraid?

8967
04:15:04,130 --> 04:15:07,010
Who'd be scared of this tiny firework?

8968
04:15:04,340 --> 04:15:11,730
h

8969
04:15:04,340 --> 04:15:11,750
Degawa squad's pride

8970
04:15:04,340 --> 04:15:11,750
When propulsion fireworks are attached to the buttocks and then ignited

8971
04:15:04,340 --> 04:15:11,750
he can endure without feeling the heat & without changing expressions

8972
04:15:07,010 --> 04:15:08,460
All right!

8973
04:15:08,460 --> 04:15:09,330
Hey!

8974
04:15:10,030 --> 04:15:11,750
All right!

8975
04:15:10,500 --> 04:15:11,750
Are you ready?

8976
04:15:11,750 --> 04:15:12,280
You can come at me any time!!

8977
04:15:12,280 --> 04:15:14,100
You can come at me any time!!

8978
04:15:12,880 --> 04:15:13,720
I'm doing it now

8979
04:15:13,720 --> 04:15:14,100
Yeah!

8980
04:15:14,100 --> 04:15:15,050
I'm lighting it up!

8981
04:15:16,820 --> 04:15:19,790
Oh, it's ignited

8982
04:15:17,460 --> 04:15:19,790
This is nothing!

8983
04:15:19,790 --> 04:15:21,330
Hey!

8984
04:15:21,330 --> 04:15:23,110
This is totally nothing at all!

8985
04:15:25,930 --> 04:15:28,030
Hot! Ouch!

8986
04:15:26,080 --> 04:15:28,030
Yeowch!!

woch!!ayylmao

8996
04:15:34,970 --> 04:15:38,340
Aren't you saying it's "hot" now ?!

8997
04:15:39,090 --> 04:15:40,360
Aren't you saying it's hot?!

8998
04:15:40,360 --> 04:15:42,280
NO I DIDN'T

8999
04:15:42,280 --> 04:15:46,150
It's not hot at all!!

9000
04:15:48,640 --> 04:15:48,750
Nice job, leader!!

9001
04:15:48,750 --> 04:15:53,890
Nice job, leader!!

9002
04:15:53,070 --> 04:15:56,160
That was really not hot at all

9003
04:15:56,610 --> 04:15:58,860
Can we stop with these small contests?

9004
04:15:58,860 --> 04:16:00,780
Bring that in!!

9005
04:16:00,780 --> 04:16:01,920
How's that?

9006
04:16:01,920 --> 04:16:03,100
What's that?

9007
04:16:03,300 --> 04:16:06,100
It's the tickle torture machine!!

9008
04:16:06,350 --> 04:16:14,810
Enter a box made of special rubber.

9009
04:16:06,350 --> 04:16:14,810
Tickle torture machine

9010
04:16:06,350 --> 04:16:14,810
When air is sucked out, it will tighten around the body and the skin becomes super sensitive

9011
04:16:06,350 --> 04:16:14,810
d

9012
04:16:06,770 --> 04:16:09,270
Someone will enter the box made of special rubber

9013
04:16:09,270 --> 04:16:12,340
It will tighten around the body when air is sucked out,

9014
04:16:12,340 --> 04:16:14,810
resulting in the skin becoming super sensitive

9015
04:16:15,110 --> 04:16:20,700
Degawa squad's pride

9016
04:16:15,110 --> 04:16:20,700
No matter how much he's tickled, he must endure,

9017
04:16:15,110 --> 04:16:20,700
h

9018
04:16:15,110 --> 04:16:20,700
without changing expressions or making a sound for an entire minute

9019
04:16:15,300 --> 04:16:18,000
In that state, he will not make a single sound

9020
04:16:18,000 --> 04:16:20,700
No matter how much he's tickled

9021
04:16:20,700 --> 04:16:23,360
Kuro-chan, go on!!

9022
04:16:22,090 --> 04:16:23,360
Okay, I'm game for it!

9023
04:16:23,360 --> 04:16:26,740
Degawa squad

9024
04:16:23,360 --> 04:16:26,740
Kuro-chan

9025
04:16:23,960 --> 04:16:25,440
This guy can't handle it

9026
04:16:25,440 --> 04:16:26,740
I can totally do it!

9027
04:16:27,290 --> 04:16:28,910
Isn't Kuro-chan the worst person to choose for this?

9028
04:16:28,910 --> 04:16:30,810
Isn't Kuro-chan the worst person to choose for this?

9029
04:16:29,910 --> 04:16:31,160

04:16:36,350 --> 04:16:38,370

9035
04:16:37,240 --> 04:16:38,370
Urp

9036
04:16:39,200 --> 04:16:40,510
Don't let out any sounds

9037
04:16:40,510 --> 04:16:40,620
I definitely won't make a sound!!

9038
04:16:40,620 --> 04:16:42,290

9040
04:16:42,290 --> 04:16:42,940
It will tighten around his body after all

9041
04:16:42,940 --> 04:16:45,540
It will tighten around his body after all

9042
04:16:43,640 --> 04:16:45,540
Will you really be all right?

9043
04:16:45,860 --> 04:16:48,010
Please start sucking out the air!!

9044
04:16:47,010 --> 04:16:48,010
You gonna be okay?

9045
04:16:48,010 --> 04:16:49,500
Kuro-chan, show 'em what you're made of!

9046
04:16:48,010 --> 04:16:55,250
Sucking out the air from the box

9047
04:16:49,500 --> 04:16:51,270
Right!

9048
04:16:55,650 --> 04:16:56,220
That's a vacuum

9049
04:16:56,220 --> 04:16:57,870
A vacuum

9050
04:16:58,660 --> 04:16:59,590

It looks so tight

9054
04:17:06,930 --> 04:17:08,850
This is easy mode, right, Kuro-chan?

9055
04:17:06,930 --> 04:17:12,570
He's in a super sensitive state after the rubber tightened around his body

9056
04:17:08,720 --> 04:17:10,170
Will he be okay?

9057
04:17:08,850 --> 04:17:10,170
Yes

9058
04:17:10,170 --> 04:17:11,540
Then the 60 seconds

9059
04:17:10,920 --> 04:17:13,720
It looks really tight around his body

9060
04:17:11,540 --> 04:17:12,570

9061
04:17:12,570 --> 04:17:13,720

Only this part of you is stiff

9066
04:17:26,000 --> 04:17:26,550

Nothing's wrong!!

9068
04:17:30,050 --> 04:17:32,520
Aren't you trembling?

9069
04:17:32,520 --> 04:17:35,230
If there's nothing wrong,

9070
04:17:33,430 --> 04:17:35,230
then why are you like this?

9071
04:17:33,890 --> 04:17:35,090

Only Komiya's touching you

9086
04:17:54,900 --> 04:17:56,310
Don't think about Komiya

9087
04:17:56,310 --> 04:17:58,720
Not Komiya

9088
04:17:56,930 --> 04:17:58,720

04:21:11,090 --> 04:21:12,680
Isn't it ready?

9213
04:21:12,680 --> 04:21:14,650
Ah, freshly made

9214
04:21:13,680 --> 04:21:14,650
Looks hot

9215
04:21:16,580 --> 04:21:17,530
He's awake!!

9216
04:21:17,530 --> 04:21:17,630
He's totally awake

9217
04:21:17,630 --> 04:21:18,180
He's totally awake

9218
04:21:18,180 --> 04:21:19,800
He's totally awake

9219
04:21:20,080 --> 04:21:22,190
That was so conspicuous!!

9220
04:21:21,200 --> 04:21:22,190
Would he reach for the crepe?

9221
04:21:22,190 --> 04:21:24,620
We'll do it again so everyone come over

9222
04:21:24,620 --> 04:21:26,520
Because he reached for the crepe

9223
04:21:25,620 --> 04:21:26,520
Oh, he did!

9224
04:21:26,520 --> 04:21:27,480
Not at all

9225
04:21:27,480 --> 04:21:29,910
Then hold his hands down

9226
04:21:29,090 --> 04:21:29,910
Oh I see

9227
04:21:29,910 --> 04:21:31,560
Then I will...

9228
04:21:30,260 --> 04:21:31,560
So he won't move

9229
04:21:30,260 --> 04:21:35,900
Crepe to be put on his face again

9230
04:21:31,560 --> 04:21:32,930
Over here too

9231
04:21:32,930 --> 04:21:34,570
Hold down his legs too

9232
04:21:34,570 --> 04:21:35,900
Hold down his legs

9233
04:21:35,900 --> 04:21:37,240
Ready

9234
04:21:37,240 --> 04:21:40,050
It's starting

9235
04:21:44,980 --> 04:21:44,990
Crepe

9236
04:21:44,990 --> 04:21:44,990
Crepe

9237
04:21:44,990 --> 04:21:45,040
Crepe

9238
04:21:45,040 --> 04:21:45,080
Crepe

9239
04:21:45,080 --> 04:21:45,090
Crepe

9240
04:21:45,090 --> 04:21:45,090
Crepe

9241
04:21:45,090 --> 04:21:45,130
Crepe

9242
04:21:45,130 --> 04:21:45,140
Crepe

9243
04:21:45,140 --> 04:21:45,140
Crepe

9244
04:21:45,140 --> 04:21:45,180
Crepe

9245
04:21:45,180 --> 04:21:45,190
Crepe

9246
04:21:45,190 --> 04:21:45,190
Crepe

9247
04:21:45,190 --> 04:21:45,230
Crepe

9248
04:21:45,230 --> 04:21:45,240
Crepe

9249
04:21:45,240 --> 04:21:45,240
Crepe

9250
04:21:45,240 --> 04:21:45,280
Crepe

9251
04:21:45,280 --> 04:21:45,290
Crepe

9252
04:21:45,290 --> 04:21:45,290
Crepe

9253
04:21:45,290 --> 04:21:45,330
Crepe

9254
04:21:45,330 --> 04:21:45,340
Crepe

9255
04:21:45,340 --> 04:21:45,340
Crepe

9256
04:21:45,340 --> 04:21:45,380
Crepe

9257
04:21:45,380 --> 04:21:45,390
Crepe

9258
04:21:45,390 --> 04:21:45,390
Crepe

9259
04:21:45,390 --> 04:21:45,430
Crepe

9260
04:21:45,430 --> 04:21:45,440
Crepe

9261
04:21:45,440 --> 04:21:45,440
Crepe

9262
04:21:45,440 --> 04:21:45,480
Crepe

9263
04:21:45,480 --> 04:21:45,490
Crepe

9264
04:21:45,490 --> 04:21:45,490
Crepe

9265
04:21:45,490 --> 04:21:45,530
Crepe

9266
04:21:45,530 --> 04:21:45,540
Crepe

9267
04:21:45,540 --> 04:21:45,540
Crepe

9268
04:21:45,540 --> 04:21:45,580
Crepe

9269
04:21:45,580 --> 04:21:45,590
Crepe

9270
04:21:45,590 --> 04:21:45,590
Crepe

9271
04:21:45,590 --> 04:21:45,630
Crepe

9272
04:21:45,630 --> 04:21:45,640
Crepe

9273
04:21:45,640 --> 04:21:45,640
Crepe

9274
04:21:45,640 --> 04:21:45,660
Crepe

9275
04:21:45,660 --> 04:21:45,690
Crepe

9276
04:21:45,690 --> 04:21:45,690
Crepe

9277
04:21:45,690 --> 04:21:45,710
Crepe

9278
04:21:45,710 --> 04:21:45,740
Crepe

9279
04:21:45,740 --> 04:21:45,740
Crepe

9280
04:21:45,740 --> 04:21:45,760
Crepe

9281
04:21:45,760 --> 04:21:45,790
Crepe

9282
04:21:45,790 --> 04:21:45,990
Crepe

9283
04:21:50,110 --> 04:21:52,680
He's definitely awake!

9284
04:21:53,990 --> 04:21:55,750
He's definitely awake

9285
04:21:56,320 --> 04:21:57,260
He threw it away!!

9286
04:22:00,530 --> 04:22:02,560
He woke up!

9287
04:22:02,560 --> 04:22:04,700
He even threw it!!

9288
04:22:04,730 --> 04:22:05,680
You can wake up now

9289
04:22:04,910 --> 04:22:09,050
Feigning Sleep Competition Complete

9290
04:22:05,680 --> 04:22:07,730
You can wake up now

9291
04:22:07,980 --> 04:22:08,880
Hey leader, you can wake up now

9292
04:22:10,800 --> 04:22:12,590
It's morning

9293
04:22:13,570 --> 04:22:14,410
They're up like normal

9294
04:22:14,970 --> 04:22:16,440
Ah, what a good nap

9295
04:22:17,630 --> 04:22:19,310
They continue into the next day

9296
04:22:18,590 --> 04:22:22,010
16 hours of work at the police station

9297
04:22:19,310 --> 04:22:22,010
It's been 16 hours since they started their shift

9298
04:22:22,730 --> 04:22:23,310
Tanaka, you don't really fart, do you?

9299
04:22:23,310 --> 04:22:25,620
Tanaka, you don't really fart, do you?

9300
04:22:25,630 --> 04:22:28,100
Yeah... I guess...

9301
04:22:28,100 --> 04:22:29,750
Endo too, right?

9302
04:22:29,890 --> 04:22:31,570
No, we don't really...

9303
04:22:30,820 --> 04:22:31,360
Are Cocorico idiots?

9304
04:22:31,360 --> 04:22:33,340
Are Cocorico idiots?

9305
04:22:32,370 --> 04:22:33,270
Idiots?

9306
04:22:33,840 --> 04:22:36,110
I don't think we're idiots...

9307
04:22:36,160 --> 04:22:38,760
Isn't the one Yama-chan let loose the most embarassing?

9308
04:22:36,610 --> 04:22:44,150
Hosei Farting While Carried

9309
04:22:39,110 --> 04:22:41,250
He farted completely on accident

9310
04:22:40,330 --> 04:22:41,300
Yeah...

9311
04:22:41,270 --> 04:22:43,650
It's because Hamada had a good grip on my butt

9312
04:22:43,870 --> 04:22:44,840
If we re-enact it could you fart again?

9313
04:22:44,840 --> 04:22:46,720
If we re-enact it could you fart again?

9314
04:22:46,720 --> 04:22:47,410
If we re-enact it could you fart again?

9315
04:22:47,520 --> 04:22:48,510
Probably, maybe

9316
04:22:48,170 --> 04:22:49,370
Could we try?

9317
04:22:48,670 --> 04:22:49,440
For real

9318
04:22:49,290 --> 04:22:50,780
Something with the inner ear

9319
04:22:49,720 --> 04:22:51,230
At that time...

9320
04:22:50,590 --> 04:22:55,650
Recreating Hosei's Fart Scene

9321
04:22:50,910 --> 04:22:54,260
I don't know anything about ears, I just held him

9322
04:22:53,290 --> 04:22:55,930
Tanaka... In Tanaka's direction...

9323
04:22:54,260 --> 04:22:55,650
Carry him in my direction like I'm about to sniff his head

9324
04:22:55,650 --> 04:22:58,230
Carry him in my direction like I'm about to sniff his head

9325
04:22:58,230 --> 04:23:01,200
Carry him in my direction like I'm about to sniff his head

9326
04:22:59,880 --> 04:23:00,950
Like that

9327
04:23:01,070 --> 04:23:02,470
Lift like this

9328
04:23:03,000 --> 04:23:04,060
Yeah

9329
04:23:03,640 --> 04:23:05,770
Wait... Someone kicked me

9330
04:23:05,820 --> 04:23:07,380
Hey

9331
04:23:07,380 --> 04:23:08,330
Stop

9332
04:23:08,840 --> 04:23:09,740
Stop!

9333
04:23:10,110 --> 04:23:11,010
Hey!

9334
04:23:11,560 --> 04:23:13,010
That hurts!

9335
04:23:12,830 --> 04:23:13,970
Wait, that hurts

9336
04:23:15,450 --> 04:23:16,430
Let him up

9337
04:23:18,590 --> 04:23:22,740
Stretch it!!

9338
04:23:19,400 --> 04:23:22,740
No, don't stretch it!

9339
04:23:21,670 --> 04:23:22,390
Which?

9340
04:23:28,480 --> 04:23:30,300
"Stretch it! No, don't stretch it!!"

9341
04:23:34,190 --> 04:23:35,750
Which is it?

9342
04:23:36,220 --> 04:23:37,270
That hurt!

9343
04:23:37,000 --> 04:23:38,960
It just wouldn't come out

9344
04:23:37,870 --> 04:23:39,990
There's no way it would!!

9345
04:23:38,160 --> 04:23:40,190
It wouldn't come out at all!

9346
04:23:39,990 --> 04:23:44,560
It's your fault too, Tanaka

9347
04:23:40,990 --> 04:23:44,560
You should've smelled him more quickly

9348
04:23:43,240 --> 04:23:46,080
I didn't think it was really necessary

9349
04:23:46,080 --> 04:23:47,570
I thought it was just re-enacting the fart...

9350
04:23:47,730 --> 04:23:51,000
Hindsight is 20-20 and all, but since Tanaka didn't smell your head...

9351
04:23:51,000 --> 04:23:52,870
that's why you shouted such impactful words

9352
04:23:52,390 --> 04:23:53,670
Yeah...

9353
04:23:53,700 --> 04:23:55,720
Stretch it, please don't stretch it

9354
04:23:54,620 --> 04:23:55,520
Stretch...

9355
04:23:55,110 --> 04:23:55,910
Stretch...

9356
04:23:55,720 --> 04:23:57,290
Stretch it, please don't stretch it

9357
04:23:55,840 --> 04:23:58,240
If you handle me so carelessly... Words like that come out

9358
04:23:57,930 --> 04:24:01,910
Things like "Stretch it, please don't stretch it"

9359
04:24:01,910 --> 04:24:04,980
That wasn't it...

9360
04:24:05,570 --> 04:24:06,320
No no no...

9361
04:24:06,100 --> 04:24:10,020
You'd understand if it was done to you, right?

9362
04:24:10,100 --> 04:24:12,220
I'm not so sure about that...

9363
04:24:12,310 --> 04:24:14,540
That's...

9364
04:24:13,440 --> 04:24:14,740
It's just that...

9365
04:24:13,470 --> 04:24:14,740
No...

9366
04:24:14,740 --> 04:24:16,110
We're different people with different senses

9367
04:24:16,110 --> 04:24:19,130
We're different people with different senses

9368
04:24:19,230 --> 04:24:20,460
Different senses...

9369
04:24:19,800 --> 04:24:20,970
Over here Yama-chan

9370
04:24:20,620 --> 04:24:22,420
I'm really heavy...

9371
04:24:22,620 --> 04:24:24,290
Heavy...

9372
04:24:22,630 --> 04:24:24,270
Yeah, heavy...

9373
04:24:25,350 --> 04:24:25,450
Fart

9374
04:24:25,450 --> 04:24:27,270
Fart

9375
04:24:29,990 --> 04:24:30,270
You've got to be kidding me

9376
04:24:30,270 --> 04:24:31,780
You've got to be kidding me

9377
04:24:33,010 --> 04:24:34,080
NO WAY!

9378
04:24:33,590 --> 04:24:34,930
Excuse me

9379
04:24:35,500 --> 04:24:36,860
YOU CAN FART!

9380
04:24:40,500 --> 04:24:41,890
IT SMELLS TOO!!

9381
04:24:41,890 --> 04:24:44,320
IT SMELLS!!

9382
04:24:44,320 --> 04:24:46,140
I would never have expected him to fart...

9383
04:24:46,140 --> 04:24:47,140
Weren't you the one who said "I never fart on television!?"

9384
04:24:47,140 --> 04:24:50,360
Weren't you the one who said "I never fart on television!?"

9385
04:24:47,440 --> 04:24:50,550
I was just saying it doesn't happen often...

9386
04:24:50,860 --> 04:24:53,160
I really farted...

9387
04:24:52,650 --> 04:24:53,730
You farted...

9388
04:24:53,380 --> 04:24:54,970
and it smells really bad!

9389
04:24:54,670 --> 04:24:55,930
Smelly

9390
04:24:55,930 --> 04:24:59,920
Attention!

9391
04:24:56,230 --> 04:24:57,400
It wasn't even that big...

9392
04:24:57,750 --> 04:24:58,870
I have no idea...

9393
04:24:58,670 --> 04:24:59,900
Yeah, really...

9394
04:24:59,970 --> 04:25:00,970
It's coming!

9395
04:25:02,870 --> 04:25:03,090
Pichu

9396
04:25:03,270 --> 04:25:05,340
I shit myself

9397
04:25:06,960 --> 04:25:09,930
Can we stop it already?

9398
04:25:10,930 --> 04:25:11,950
What are you doing?

9399
04:25:12,580 --> 04:25:14,090
What ARE you doing?

9400
04:25:13,870 --> 04:25:14,890
Wait...

9401
04:25:14,240 --> 04:25:15,550
For real...

9402
04:25:15,920 --> 04:25:16,650
Hey...

9403
04:25:16,670 --> 04:25:19,070
What are you doing!? We got it already...

9404
04:25:20,440 --> 04:25:21,690
You said it

9405
04:25:20,610 --> 04:25:22,130
Give me a break

9406
04:25:21,830 --> 04:25:22,810
It really came out, we know it

9407
04:25:22,810 --> 04:25:24,010
It really came out, we know it

9408
04:25:24,110 --> 04:25:25,660
What were you doing?

9409
04:25:25,810 --> 04:25:26,180
It went "Pichu" too

9410
04:25:26,180 --> 04:25:28,800
It went "Pichu" too

9411
04:25:26,800 --> 04:25:28,120
It did

9412
04:25:27,580 --> 04:25:28,480
It did

9413
04:25:28,320 --> 04:25:29,700
It really came out

9414
04:25:28,870 --> 04:25:29,850
No no no...

9415
04:25:29,850 --> 04:25:30,740
Over here I let a good fart out

9416
04:25:30,740 --> 04:25:32,800
Over here I let a good fart out

9417
04:25:32,800 --> 04:25:34,910
Since it was so loud at the time it was drowned out

9418
04:25:34,540 --> 04:25:35,140
We couldn't hear...

9419
04:25:34,910 --> 04:25:36,670
Since it was so loud at the time it was drowned out

9420
04:25:36,690 --> 04:25:38,330
I tried to hold it in quietly

9421
04:25:38,330 --> 04:25:39,510
When I thought, "Now is better"

9422
04:25:39,510 --> 04:25:40,610
About more than 80% of it had already been released

9423
04:25:40,610 --> 04:25:42,180
About more than 80% of it had already been released

9424
04:25:42,180 --> 04:25:47,450
With only about 20% left is what I tried to push out

9425
04:25:47,550 --> 04:25:49,220
I shit myself

9426
04:25:49,220 --> 04:25:52,940
So you really pushed out 30%

9427
04:25:55,790 --> 04:25:57,580
What are you thinking!?

9428
04:25:57,350 --> 04:26:00,920
What are you doing...

9429
04:26:02,520 --> 04:26:03,820
I get it though...

9430
04:26:03,850 --> 04:26:06,370
Tanaka go smell it

9431
04:26:04,940 --> 04:26:05,690
WHAT!?

9432
04:26:05,390 --> 04:26:06,870
Woah!

9433
04:26:05,920 --> 04:26:07,460
You have got to be kidding me

9434
04:26:07,470 --> 04:26:09,870
He literally shit himself...

9435
04:26:08,810 --> 04:26:10,040
Tanaka smell it!

9436
04:26:10,490 --> 04:26:12,490
No no no no...

9437
04:26:11,010 --> 04:26:12,430
As Hamada says...

9438
04:26:11,740 --> 04:26:14,110
We don't know if he really shit himself or not!!

9439
04:26:14,160 --> 04:26:15,100
Seriously

9440
04:26:15,150 --> 04:26:16,110
Seriously smell it

9441
04:26:17,110 --> 04:26:18,270
Excuse me

9442
04:26:28,040 --> 04:26:29,710
I can't believe you did it

9443
04:26:28,660 --> 04:26:30,610
For real, it's legit

9444
04:26:29,840 --> 04:26:30,860
That's the worst

9445
04:26:34,270 --> 04:26:35,400
This is the worst

9446
04:26:37,000 --> 04:26:38,250
That's no good

9447
04:26:37,640 --> 04:26:39,040
This is too much

9448
04:26:39,250 --> 04:26:40,570
No good

9449
04:26:40,220 --> 04:26:43,770
When comedians have to

9450
04:26:41,370 --> 04:26:43,770
resort to shitting their pants to get a laugh, that's it, it's over

9451
04:26:42,310 --> 04:26:43,920
That's the end times

9452
04:26:43,920 --> 04:26:45,380
That's it, we're through

9453
04:26:44,640 --> 04:26:45,930
That's a good sign to stop

9454
04:26:46,410 --> 04:26:49,580
Not to mention on a New Year's Special

9455
04:26:47,700 --> 04:26:49,980
Particularly bad for a New Year's Special

9456
04:26:49,810 --> 04:26:51,370
Oh man my belly hurts

9457
04:26:50,720 --> 04:26:51,980
He pooped...

9458
04:26:52,050 --> 04:26:52,900
Does any of the smell escape from the hem?

9459
04:26:52,900 --> 04:26:54,850
Does any of the smell escape from the hem?

9460
04:26:55,250 --> 04:26:57,890
Amazingly, there doesn't seem to be any smell escaping

9461
04:26:57,920 --> 04:26:58,690
Really?

9462
04:26:58,510 --> 04:27:00,880
As for whether or not it escapes from the hem...

9463
04:27:00,880 --> 04:27:02,010
Excuse me

9464
04:27:01,210 --> 04:27:02,180
Excuse me

9465
04:27:02,440 --> 04:27:03,610
From here, right?

9466
04:27:03,580 --> 04:27:05,560
Make sure you get a good grip

9467
04:27:05,160 --> 04:27:05,850
Yeah

9468
04:27:07,480 --> 04:27:09,430
No problem there

9469
04:27:08,420 --> 04:27:10,180
It doesn't escape out the hem

9470
04:27:10,450 --> 04:27:11,140
Move upward and
see where you can smell it from

9471
04:27:11,140 --> 04:27:13,800
Move upward and
see where you can smell it from

9472
04:27:14,770 --> 04:27:17,580
Find the boundary of the smell

9473
04:27:15,940 --> 04:27:17,430
Up like this?

9474
04:27:18,040 --> 04:27:19,210
Keep saying, "No smell"
the whole way up

9475
04:27:19,210 --> 04:27:20,950
Keep saying, "No smell"
the whole way up

9476
04:27:19,630 --> 04:27:20,390
Yeah, like that

9477
04:27:22,410 --> 04:27:23,210
No smell

9478
04:27:23,760 --> 04:27:24,530
No smell

9479
04:27:24,280 --> 04:27:25,270
Yeah

9480
04:27:25,300 --> 04:27:26,050
No smell

9481
04:27:26,550 --> 04:27:27,300
No smell

9482
04:27:28,600 --> 04:27:29,240
No smell

9483
04:27:29,840 --> 04:27:30,490
Good

9484
04:27:30,350 --> 04:27:31,060
No smell

9485
04:27:30,940 --> 04:27:31,670
Surprisingly good

9486
04:27:32,170 --> 04:27:32,860
No smell

9487
04:27:32,870 --> 04:27:34,380
It's surprisingly not that smelly

9488
04:27:33,570 --> 04:27:34,930
SMELLY!

9489
04:27:39,710 --> 04:27:41,250
So it's about here

9490
04:27:39,880 --> 04:27:41,270
About here

9491
04:27:42,700 --> 04:27:43,580
It really smells

9492
04:27:43,980 --> 04:27:45,000
Me too?

9493
04:27:49,470 --> 04:27:50,740
Please get me new underpants

9494
04:27:50,880 --> 04:27:51,780
No more please

9495
04:27:51,880 --> 04:27:54,810
While you're certainly my junior,







I'm really sorry for this, it's really embarrassing

9496
04:27:54,810 --> 04:27:57,230
While you're certainly my junior,







I'm really sorry for this, it's really embarrassing

9497
04:27:55,560 --> 04:27:56,480
No no no it's fine

9498
04:27:58,480 --> 04:28:01,040
1:30 AM

9499
04:27:59,780 --> 04:28:03,620
17 hours and 30 minutes of service

9500
04:28:01,040 --> 04:28:04,370
Only a small amount of time left at the police station

9501
04:28:04,370 --> 04:28:07,930
The five face their last exercise

9502
04:28:16,720 --> 04:28:17,570
Here it is

9503
04:28:27,260 --> 04:28:27,850
Mama read me a picture book

9504
04:28:27,850 --> 04:28:30,180
Mama read me a picture book

9505
04:28:30,730 --> 04:28:32,020
Today I'm going to read you a special book

9506
04:28:32,020 --> 04:28:33,850
Today I'm going to read you a special book

9507
04:28:33,850 --> 04:28:35,850
Today I'm going to read you a special book

9508
04:28:36,420 --> 04:28:37,960
What's the story about?

9509
04:28:38,270 --> 04:28:45,900
A story where five comedians

9510
04:28:39,920 --> 04:28:45,900
get eaten by a very scary monster

9511
04:28:43,840 --> 04:28:45,880
Sounds good! Quick, read it!

9512
04:28:46,110 --> 04:28:48,080
Alright, come closer

9513
04:28:53,100 --> 04:28:56,570
Cookie

9514
04:28:53,100 --> 04:28:56,570
T/N: Cookie is a Japanese comedian from the duo, Ninety-Nine. He does impersonations by painting his face to look like whoever he is imitating. He has a very distinct and creepy art style.

9515
04:28:53,100 --> 04:28:56,570
Yasei Bakudan

9516
04:28:56,270 --> 04:28:57,530
What's that face

9517
04:28:56,690 --> 04:28:58,010
Here we go

9518
04:28:58,680 --> 04:29:25,040
A long long time ago, there were 5 comedians named Matsumoto, Hamada, Hosei, Endo, Tanaka. One time while they were having a nice chat in their room, and a masked group came and took away Hosei and Endo.

9519
04:29:01,750 --> 04:29:07,700
By Cookie

9520
04:29:32,040 --> 04:29:33,610
AAAAH!!

9521
04:29:32,340 --> 04:29:33,940
WATCH OUT!!

9522
04:29:32,780 --> 04:29:37,620
Sudden Blackout

9523
04:29:33,460 --> 04:29:35,110
HEY!!

9524
04:29:33,960 --> 04:29:34,660
Scary!!

9525
04:29:34,260 --> 04:29:34,960
Scary!!

9526
04:29:34,660 --> 04:29:35,360
Scary!!

9527
04:29:34,960 --> 04:29:35,610
Scary!!

9528
04:29:35,250 --> 04:29:35,780
It's really dark

9529
04:29:35,660 --> 04:29:36,380
Scary!!

9530
04:29:35,780 --> 04:29:37,620
It's really dark

9531
04:29:35,960 --> 04:29:36,680
Scary!!

9532
04:29:36,060 --> 04:29:37,030
Scary!!

9533
04:29:36,060 --> 04:29:37,620
Dark!!

9534
04:29:36,330 --> 04:29:37,620
Dark!!

9535
04:29:36,330 --> 04:29:37,620
Dark!!

9536
04:29:36,730 --> 04:29:37,620
Dark!!

9537
04:29:37,010 --> 04:29:37,620
Dark!!

9538
04:29:37,180 --> 04:29:37,620
Dark!!

9539
04:29:37,620 --> 04:29:39,250
What!? HUH!?

9540
04:29:39,230 --> 04:29:39,950
What!? HUH!?

9541
04:29:43,270 --> 04:29:47,630
There is no trace of Endo or Hosei

9542
04:29:51,860 --> 04:29:53,980
NUAHHHH!!

9543
04:29:52,210 --> 04:29:53,980
Who are you people!!

9544
04:29:53,980 --> 04:29:54,180
Watch out!!

9545
04:29:54,180 --> 04:29:54,380
Watch out!!

9546
04:29:54,380 --> 04:29:55,600
Watch out!!

9547
04:29:55,730 --> 04:29:59,600
The picture book comes alive...

9548
04:29:56,530 --> 04:29:59,020
Scary!!

9549
04:29:59,600 --> 04:30:01,140
And once again...

9550
04:30:04,790 --> 04:30:05,710
Hey, mama

9551
04:30:05,710 --> 04:30:09,810
What happens to Hosei and Endo?

9552
04:30:09,830 --> 04:30:19,740
About Hosei and Endo... They were to have all of their teeth pulled and replaced with the whites of Mahjong tiles

9553
04:30:11,730 --> 04:30:15,240
Endo

9554
04:30:11,730 --> 04:30:15,240
Hosei

9555
04:30:20,120 --> 04:30:22,030
So scary~!

9556
04:30:21,660 --> 04:30:23,110
It was really scary!

9557
04:30:22,080 --> 04:30:23,690
Really scary! Scaaaarrrrry!

9558
04:30:23,690 --> 04:30:24,850
Really scary! Scaaaarrrrry!

9559
04:30:24,850 --> 04:30:26,830
Really scary! Scaaaarrrrry!

9560
04:30:27,730 --> 04:30:42,210
Endo

9561
04:30:27,730 --> 04:30:42,210
Hosei

9562
04:30:27,730 --> 04:30:42,210
The white Mahjong tiles didn't match with Hosei and Endo's body so it became the same color as plaque! Then plaque-colored zits started covering their entire bodies!

9563
04:30:42,930 --> 04:30:44,180
We have to go save Hosei and Endo

9564
04:30:44,180 --> 04:30:47,000
We have to go save Hosei and Endo

9565
04:30:47,000 --> 04:30:48,400
From here on out you can laugh all you want, but you can't get scared!!

9566
04:30:48,400 --> 04:30:49,850
From here on out you can laugh all you want, but you can't get scared!!

9567
04:30:49,850 --> 04:30:54,630
From here on out you can laugh all you want, but you can't get scared!!

9568
04:30:55,040 --> 04:31:02,430
Hosei and Endo are on the ground floor warehouse

9569
04:31:06,870 --> 04:31:08,170
Why do they have us do this at a time







when we're completely out of energy?

9570
04:31:08,170 --> 04:31:10,590
Why do they have us do this at a time







when we're completely out of energy?

9571
04:31:11,140 --> 04:31:17,830
Special Night Time Rules

9572
04:31:12,640 --> 04:31:17,830
American Police

9573
04:31:12,640 --> 04:31:17,830
You Absolutely Must Not Get Scared

9574
04:31:18,030 --> 04:31:21,950
Ground Floor Warehouse

9575
04:31:18,130 --> 04:31:19,850
Wait, wait wait... That hurts

9576
04:31:18,870 --> 04:31:21,400
Endo and Hosei were taken away

9577
04:31:21,400 --> 04:31:23,850
to the ground floor warehouse

9578
04:31:21,950 --> 04:31:28,630
Restrained and Confined

9579
04:31:28,940 --> 04:31:34,880
Headed to the warehouse to rescue Endo and Hosei

9580
04:31:29,390 --> 04:31:33,760
The three head to the warehouse in order to rescue Hosei and Endo

9581
04:31:35,670 --> 04:31:39,000
Off to the rescue

9582
04:31:38,440 --> 04:31:39,600

Confinement room

9771
04:36:04,140 --> 04:36:05,410
That startled me

9772
04:36:05,460 --> 04:36:06,670
What? A hamburg steak!?

9773
04:36:06,670 --> 04:36:07,940
What? A hamburg steak!?

9774
04:36:08,280 --> 04:36:14,110
In conjunction with voice, a food display of a hamburg steak falls

9775
04:36:08,280 --> 04:36:14,110
T/N: These food displays are the fake wax/plastic food samples

9776
04:36:09,080 --> 04:36:10,400
Oh, I get it

9777

A hamburg steak

9778
04:36:11,360 --> 04:36:12,080
It really...

9779
04:36:12,080 --> 04:36:14,110
Why?

9780
04:36:12,650 --> 04:36:14,110
Why?

9781
04:36:14,680 --> 04:36:15,520

9782
04:36:15,520 --> 04:36:17,520

04:36:17,820 --> 04:36:19,050
If you give your kid New Year's money, then giving 1129 yen is good

9785
04:36:17,820 --> 04:36:23,660
T/N: In Japan, it's customary to give the kids in your family an envelope with money on New Years. Very similar to the Chinese red envelope.

If you give your kid New Year's money, then giving 1129 yen is good

9787
04:36:20,890 --> 04:36:23,660
If you give your kid New Year's money, then giving 1129 yen is good

9788
04:36:24,260 --> 04:36:26,230
Why such an amount?

9789
04:36:26,230 --> 04:36:26,490
1129 that's right, good meat

9790
04:36:26,230 --> 04:36:30,700
T/N: In Japanese, each number is associated with particular syllables that is usually based on the first syllable of how you say that number. "Ichi" is 1, "Ni" is 2, "Kyu" is 9. If you simplify, 1129 becomes "i-i-ni-ku" which means "good meat".

9791
04:36:26,490 --> 04:36:26,990
1129 that's right, good meat

9792
04:36:26,990 --> 04:36:27,190
1129 that's right, good meat

There's people right here, so I'll start the interview

9867
04:37:27,490 --> 04:37:31,220
News coverage attack by the reporters

9882
04:37:51,110 --> 04:37:52,680
I feel like when comparing you with the commercials, you don't really sound as enthusiastic

9883
04:37:52,680 --> 04:37:55,020
I feel like when comparing you with the commercials, you don't really sound as enthusiastic

9884
04:37:53,920 --> 04:37:54,640
Ah, I see

Tanaka’s rare explosive laughter

9902
04:38:19,300 --> 04:38:20,600
How embarassing

9903
04:38:22,420 --> 04:38:23,740
That'd really piss you off

9904
04:38:23,950 --> 04:38:29,280
Even just within this entire year,

9905
04:38:25,980 --> 04:38:29,280

9906
04:38:29,950 --> 04:38:36,890
Their road to rescue is quite steep

Their road to rescue is quite steep, but their trial continues

9908
04:38:37,560 --> 04:38:39,490
Eh, what's that?

9909

There's something... Says, "Wait here"

9910

Huh, there was this kind of thing

9915
04:38:48,340 --> 04:38:51,100
What does it mean by  "Wait here"?

9916

9943
04:39:25,190 --> 04:39:25,860
cue card

9944
04:39:25,820 --> 04:39:30,760

9945
04:39:25,860 --> 04:39:26,510
cue card

9946
04:39:27,840 --> 04:39:32,450
Mean older sister confiscates the cue card

9947
04:39:30,780 --> 04:39:31,880
Is that okay with you?

9948
04:39:31,940 --> 04:39:32,620
Oh, alright

9949
04:39:32,780 --> 04:39:40,590
Greetings from the transferred sexy police

9950
04:39:33,120 --> 04:39:34,620
Please, go ahead

9951
04:39:36,040 --> 04:39:36,620
Who is that?

9952
04:39:38,160 --> 04:39:39,840
They're really walking slowly

9953
04:39:39,840 --> 04:39:41,220
Who is that?

9954
04:39:41,220 --> 04:39:43,420
It's the sexy policeman!!

9955
04:39:47,260 --> 04:39:51,030
T/N: Yuriyan Retriever is a solo comedian who specializes in comedy skits that involves dancing, speaking in English, playing piano, etc.

9956
04:39:47,260 --> 04:39:51,030
Yuriyan Retriever appears in her own costume

9957
04:39:50,580 --> 04:39:51,220
That's how it is

9958
04:39:51,350 --> 04:39:53,740
How annoying

9959
04:39:53,800 --> 04:39:54,440
Yuriyan Redriever!!

9960
04:39:53,800 --> 04:39:58,410
T/N: The Kanou Sisters mispronounced Yuriyan's name.

9961
04:39:54,440 --> 04:39:58,410
Yuriyan Redriever!!

9962
04:39:56,620 --> 04:39:57,640
"Redriever"...

9963
04:39:59,140 --> 04:40:01,940
That body!!

9964
04:40:01,940 --> 04:40:05,980
Word of farewell

9965
04:40:07,950 --> 04:40:09,030
Ahaa

9966
04:40:09,020 --> 04:40:10,320
Ahaa

9967
04:40:11,870 --> 04:40:15,020
Aaah

9968
04:40:12,920 --> 04:40:18,990
Her heart is full and no words come out

9969
04:40:21,190 --> 04:40:22,660
Aauh

9970
04:40:22,660 --> 04:40:24,930
Say it already

9971
04:40:25,850 --> 04:40:26,870
Aaah

9972
04:40:26,870 --> 04:40:28,850
Aaah

9973
04:40:29,000 --> 04:40:32,140
How irritating

9974
04:40:33,590 --> 04:40:33,720
Ooh

9975
04:40:33,720 --> 04:40:35,040
Ooh

9976
04:40:38,080 --> 04:40:38,210
What's with this just say it already

9977
04:40:38,200 --> 04:40:38,330
What's with this, just say it already

9978
04:40:38,330 --> 04:40:40,280
What's with this, just say it already

9979
04:40:40,280 --> 04:40:44,250
What's with this, just say it already

9980
04:40:44,620 --> 04:40:48,120
I don't wanna look at it!!

9981
04:40:44,620 --> 04:40:48,120
Not paying attention?

9982
04:40:48,220 --> 04:40:50,080
They're not even watching

9983
04:40:50,300 --> 04:40:50,980
Right?

9984
04:40:52,730 --> 04:40:55,860
Ending the farewell with one word

9985
04:40:52,740 --> 04:40:53,420
She finally said it

9986
04:40:53,340 --> 04:40:53,900
Yeah...

9987
04:40:56,520 --> 04:41:03,620
With the farewell over, a route to Hosei and Endo's confinement is revealed

9988
04:40:56,780 --> 04:41:04,540
A route to the warehouse is revealed

9989
04:40:56,780 --> 04:41:04,540
Hosei and Endo's place of confinement

9990
04:41:05,010 --> 04:41:07,980
But that route is in jet black darkness

9991
04:41:05,010 --> 04:41:07,980
Jet black darkness

9992
04:41:07,500 --> 04:41:08,340
Yeah, it really was

9993
04:41:08,390 --> 04:41:13,250
Rescue is futile

9994
04:41:08,700 --> 04:41:12,600
Without going on this path, Hosei and Endo's rescue is futile

9995
04:41:10,460 --> 04:41:11,860
That sure is scary

9996
04:41:12,140 --> 04:41:12,520
Yeah

9997
04:41:13,550 --> 04:41:17,190
Leaving the camera to Tanaka

9998
04:41:13,580 --> 04:41:15,420
Please make sure to film everyone's faces

9999
04:41:14,320 --> 04:41:15,220
Faces? Okay, I understand

10000
04:41:15,980 --> 04:41:17,220
Face it towards us, okay?

10001
04:41:16,840 --> 04:41:17,160
That's right

10002
04:41:17,380 --> 04:41:23,390
Please observe the footage from the night vision camera that was entrusted to Tanaka

10003
04:41:17,460 --> 04:41:22,760
From now on please observe the night vision camera footage from the camera entrusted to Tanaka

10004
04:41:18,860 --> 04:41:21,100
Endo

10005
04:41:23,390 --> 04:41:33,100
Tanaka Camera

10006
04:41:23,600 --> 04:41:24,860
Please be careful

10007
04:41:24,840 --> 04:41:26,140
Please be careful

10008
04:41:25,980 --> 04:41:27,520
Be careful, alright?

10009
04:41:28,060 --> 04:41:32,000
That was a waste of time

10010
04:41:29,540 --> 04:41:30,520
Yeah, that's right

10011
04:41:34,160 --> 04:41:34,800
Over here

10012
04:41:34,800 --> 04:41:37,240
Just go straight

10013
04:41:39,910 --> 04:41:43,140
This is scary

10014
04:41:47,560 --> 04:41:48,760
Ugh...

10015
04:41:48,760 --> 04:41:50,360
Wha-!?

10016
04:41:48,760 --> 04:41:50,360
Wha-!?

10017
04:41:50,690 --> 04:41:55,560
The three got scared over nothing

10018
04:41:54,650 --> 04:41:57,620
It was creepy anyway

10019
04:41:56,610 --> 04:41:59,300
Geez...

10020
04:42:01,740 --> 04:42:03,640
God this is making my shoulders stiff

10021
04:42:03,640 --> 04:42:07,110
God this is making my shoulders stiff

10022
04:42:07,100 --> 04:42:09,060
Hamada's face is so funny

10023
04:42:07,440 --> 04:42:12,260
Scarecrow

10024
04:42:11,050 --> 04:42:12,510
What's this? Creepy!

10025
04:42:12,510 --> 04:42:14,880
What's this? Creepy!

10026
04:42:13,250 --> 04:42:14,880
Wait a second!

10027
04:42:14,880 --> 04:42:15,580
What's wrong?

10028
04:42:15,580 --> 04:42:17,390
Those are my clothes!

10029
04:42:17,570 --> 04:42:24,730
The scarecrow is wearing Tanaka's clothes

10030
04:42:17,660 --> 04:42:20,040
What the hell are they doing?

10031
04:42:19,440 --> 04:42:21,640
He immediately noticed them

10032
04:42:20,540 --> 04:42:21,640
I did

10033
04:42:21,620 --> 04:42:24,730
Give me a break

10034
04:42:22,640 --> 04:42:24,540
This was irritating

10035
04:42:23,940 --> 04:42:24,520
I bet it was

10036
04:42:24,730 --> 04:42:28,930
These are the clothes I was wearing today for the opening

10037
04:42:25,420 --> 04:42:28,900
This is really irritating

10038
04:42:28,930 --> 04:42:32,970
So freaking irritating

10039
04:42:31,280 --> 04:42:32,970
This is too much

10040
04:42:33,320 --> 04:42:37,340
They leave it to move on

10041
04:42:38,490 --> 04:42:42,480
I can see a

10042
04:42:39,290 --> 04:42:42,480
sort of signboard over there

10043
04:42:39,840 --> 04:42:42,480
Yeah there's definitely a sign over there

10044
04:42:45,140 --> 04:42:48,360
The love fortune slip who can tell the fortune of the fated one

10045
04:42:45,140 --> 04:42:51,750
T/N: You can buy fortunes at a Shinto shrine to see if there's good luck in your future. If you get a bad fortune, you're supposed to tie it at the shrine to ward off the unluckiness and keep the good ones, but a lot of people end up tying both good and bad fortunes.

10046
04:42:48,360 --> 04:42:51,750
If you draw a fortune slip, please tie it

10047
04:42:51,750 --> 04:42:53,860
Tanaka!!

10048
04:42:53,860 --> 04:42:56,520
Come on, let's do this all together

10049
04:42:56,870 --> 04:43:01,630
Without even discussing it, Tanaka draws a fortune slip

10050
04:42:57,180 --> 04:43:01,640
Without even discussing it, Tanaka is of course going to draw it

10051
04:43:02,540 --> 04:43:03,920
Did you take it?

10052
04:43:03,920 --> 04:43:04,500
Not yet

10053
04:43:04,740 --> 04:43:06,240
Are you ok?

10054
04:43:05,120 --> 04:43:06,240
He's ok

10055
04:43:05,370 --> 04:43:13,660
Prank starts in

10056
04:43:06,600 --> 04:43:08,160
Woah this is scary!

10057
04:43:08,160 --> 04:43:10,820
This is so scary! It's terrifying!

10058
04:43:09,100 --> 04:43:13,660
seconds

10059
04:43:10,820 --> 04:43:12,420
Is this one, right?

10060
04:43:17,850 --> 04:43:23,720
A 2m tall female Hamada from the ground

10061
04:43:17,850 --> 04:43:23,720
T/N: 2 meters is about 6ft 7in in freedom units.

10062
04:43:20,180 --> 04:43:21,900
What the hell?

10063
04:43:23,720 --> 04:43:29,590
Hamada's Camera

10064
04:43:23,940 --> 04:43:25,820
Woah!!

10065
04:43:25,820 --> 04:43:26,150
What? What? What? What?

10066
04:43:26,150 --> 04:43:26,390
What? What? What? What?

10067
04:43:26,390 --> 04:43:26,620
What? What? What? What?

10068
04:43:26,620 --> 04:43:28,320
What? What? What? What?

10069
04:43:28,320 --> 04:43:29,590
Something's coming!!

10070
04:43:30,690 --> 04:43:33,430
This is going to

10071
04:43:31,460 --> 04:43:33,430
leave me paralyzed!

10072
04:43:33,900 --> 04:43:35,160
It's so huge!

10073
04:43:35,160 --> 04:43:35,500
Woah! Scary scary scary

10074
04:43:35,500 --> 04:43:35,660
Woah! Scary scary scary

10075
04:43:35,660 --> 04:43:35,760
Woah! Scary scary scary

10076
04:43:35,760 --> 04:43:36,260
Woah! Scary scary scary

10077
04:43:36,260 --> 04:43:36,760
Scary! Freaking huge!

10078
04:43:36,760 --> 04:43:37,700
Scary! Freaking huge!

10079
04:43:37,700 --> 04:43:38,100
Scary! That's so scary!

10080
04:43:38,100 --> 04:43:39,270
Scary! That's so scary!

10081
04:43:39,270 --> 04:43:39,570
Scary scary scary!

10082
04:43:39,570 --> 04:43:39,970
Scary scary scary!

10083
04:43:39,970 --> 04:43:41,500
Scary scary scary!

10084
04:43:41,500 --> 04:43:41,800
Huge huge huge!

10085
04:43:41,800 --> 04:43:42,070
Huge huge huge!

10086
04:43:42,070 --> 04:43:43,670
Huge huge huge!

10087
04:43:43,250 --> 04:43:43,420
Aaaaah!

10088
04:43:43,420 --> 04:43:44,560
Aaaaah!

10089
04:43:44,090 --> 04:43:44,260
Scary!

10090
04:43:44,260 --> 04:43:44,740
Scary!

10091
04:43:44,560 --> 04:43:45,140
Aaaaah!

10092
04:43:44,740 --> 04:43:45,140
Scary!

10093
04:43:47,530 --> 04:43:51,210
This is no good

10094
04:43:48,110 --> 04:43:51,210
my back's gonna go out!!

10095
04:43:48,920 --> 04:43:51,210
It was so scary!

10096
04:43:50,420 --> 04:43:51,210
And huge

10097
04:43:51,210 --> 04:43:53,720
It was so freaking scary!

10098
04:43:53,880 --> 04:43:54,820
Scary

10099
04:43:54,820 --> 04:43:56,150
The hell is this?

10100
04:43:56,150 --> 04:43:57,250
It was huge and it looked like a girl.

10101
04:43:57,250 --> 04:44:02,980
It was huge and it looked like a girl.

10102
04:43:58,820 --> 04:43:59,500
A woman?

10103
04:43:59,250 --> 04:44:02,990
It looked like it was a little girl, with skirt and everything

10104
04:44:03,310 --> 04:44:06,330
Warehouse

10105
04:44:03,350 --> 04:44:03,490

Heeeeey!!

04:44:05,580 --> 04:44:06,360
It's here

10110
04:44:06,330 --> 04:44:09,760
Help us!!

10111
04:44:07,120 --> 04:44:09,840
What the hell is wrong with them?

10112
04:44:10,900 --> 04:44:12,530
They're here

10113
04:44:11,620 --> 04:44:12,530
Thank God

10114
04:44:12,530 --> 04:44:15,470
Finding you was a big deal you know

10115
04:44:15,720 --> 04:44:21,740
Hosei and Endo's rescue: successful

10116
04:44:16,220 --> 04:44:19,160
They safely rescued both Endo and Hosei

10117
04:44:18,500 --> 04:44:20,780
Finally

10118
04:44:18,600 --> 04:44:20,780
I'm so glad

10119
04:44:20,800 --> 04:44:21,740

10123
04:44:34,820 --> 04:44:37,830

You can call me Elegant-Beauty if you please

10126
04:44:42,700 --> 04:44:44,170
What's wrong, folks?
You all seem genuinely rustled

10127
04:44:44,170 --> 04:44:47,140
What's wrong, folks?
You all seem genuinely rustled

10128
04:44:47,540 --> 04:44:51,840
SPACE

10129
04:44:54,340 --> 04:44:55,940
Don't worry, I'll give you a present in the end

10130
04:44:55,940 --> 04:44:58,180
Don't worry, I'll give you a present in the end

10131
04:44:57,000 --> 04:44:58,180
So please accept it!

10132

Let's exit!

10139
04:45:23,260 --> 04:45:23,960
Let's go

10140
04:45:26,070 --> 04:45:30,110
A warning sound announces a state of emergency

10141
04:45:28,540 --> 04:45:30,120
Keep on going

10142
04:45:29,840 --> 04:45:31,060
What's that?

10143
04:45:31,060 --> 04:45:32,460

04:45:39,090 --> 04:45:46,290
Prank starts in

10147
04:45:39,860 --> 04:45:41,440
You all ready?

10148
04:45:40,140 --> 04:45:41,440

10158
04:45:55,300 --> 04:45:55,900
He's riding it!

10159
04:45:55,900 --> 04:45:56,450
He's riding it!

10160
04:45:56,450 --> 04:45:57,870
You all must open your eyes to the Heisei Era we're living in!

10161
04:45:56,450 --> 04:45:59,970
T/N: In Japan, eras are determined by how long the emperor rules. 2018 is the 30th year of the Heisei Era.

10162
04:45:57,870 --> 04:45:59,970
You all must open your eyes to the Heisei Era we're living in!

10163
04:46:05,470 --> 04:46:08,450
Faster!!

10164
04:46:09,720 --> 04:46:12,950
Pedal faster!!

10165
04:46:12,180 --> 04:46:13,220
So slow

10166
04:46:15,580 --> 04:46:16,820
Watch out!

10167
04:46:19,080 --> 04:46:20,220
Watch out!

10168
04:46:22,480 --> 04:46:23,820
Watch out!

10169
04:46:24,770 --> 04:46:27,030
This is so excessive!

10170
04:46:25,900 --> 04:46:27,040
Watch out

10171
04:46:28,570 --> 04:46:35,580
The 5 survived with no harm

10172
04:46:29,940 --> 04:46:31,820
So hot!

10173
04:46:30,460 --> 04:46:31,820
Woah

10174
04:46:31,820 --> 04:46:32,940
That was something

10175
04:46:32,940 --> 04:46:35,080
They were riding it

10176
04:46:38,250 --> 04:46:42,080
19 hours passed since their duty at the police station

10177
04:46:39,100 --> 04:46:40,720
It's 3 A.M.

10178
04:46:42,640 --> 04:46:47,020
This year, our five men took the role of American policemen rookies

10179
04:46:47,020 --> 04:46:51,020
And went through several harsh duties

10180
04:46:53,360 --> 04:46:56,620
They overcame lots of hardships

10181
04:46:56,620 --> 04:47:00,880
But it's finally time for them to welcome this moment

10182
04:47:03,540 --> 04:47:05,010
How are you guys?

10183
04:47:05,010 --> 04:47:07,110
Your long American Police training has come to an end

10184
04:47:07,110 --> 04:47:09,510
Your long American Police training has come to an end

10185
04:47:09,510 --> 04:47:11,110
You all did pretty good

10186
04:47:11,110 --> 04:47:13,010
Shall we go, then?

10187
04:47:13,010 --> 04:47:16,950
It's over, huh...

10188
04:47:14,320 --> 04:47:16,160
It's finally over

10189
04:47:14,940 --> 04:47:16,160
We're done, we're done

10190
04:47:17,360 --> 04:47:18,820
I'm so glad

10191
04:47:17,940 --> 04:47:23,820
Police Station Entrance

10192
04:47:26,790 --> 04:47:28,960
Huh?

10193
04:47:28,960 --> 04:47:29,900
Is that...?

10194
04:47:30,100 --> 04:47:32,500
Thank you for your service!

10195
04:47:30,600 --> 04:47:33,800

10198
04:47:34,770 --> 04:47:35,140
Ah-!

10199
04:47:35,150 --> 04:47:37,270
The chef--- chief of this station, Heipo

10200
04:47:37,270 --> 04:47:39,410
I'm pleased to meet you

10201
04:47:39,710 --> 04:47:40,740
How about I tell you a riddle to end this year? ...It's over, right?

10202
04:47:40,740 --> 04:47:41,810
How about I tell you a riddle to end this year? ...It's over, right?

10203
04:47:41,810 --> 04:47:42,460
How about I tell you a riddle to end this year? ...It's over, right?

10204
04:47:42,460 --> 04:47:43,780
How about I tell you a riddle to end this year? ...It's over, right?

10205
04:47:44,860 --> 04:47:46,700
Huh? Are you ending it or not?

10206
04:47:46,760 --> 04:47:49,960
How about you use the syllables making "PO-RI-SU" (police)?

10207
04:47:48,380 --> 04:47:53,050
Police (PORISU)

10208
04:47:48,380 --> 04:47:53,050
Syllables composition theme:

10209
04:47:49,980 --> 04:47:51,360
It's just 3 syllabes

10210
04:47:51,360 --> 04:47:52,040
Together?

10211
04:47:52,040 --> 04:47:53,180
No no, alone

10212
04:47:53,090 --> 04:47:55,590

SUKANKU
A skunk

10218
04:48:07,600 --> 04:48:10,800
Why animals?

10219
04:48:08,060 --> 04:48:10,800
That didn't make any sense

10220
04:48:15,840 --> 04:48:16,720
Heipo!

10221
04:48:16,720 --> 04:48:17,540
What?

10222
04:48:17,540 --> 04:48:18,700
Come on, man!

10223
04:48:18,700 --> 04:48:20,500
Gotta go, we gotta leave man!

10224
04:48:24,580 --> 04:48:25,560
We gotta go

10225
04:48:26,090 --> 04:48:28,520
Where is he taking him?

10226
04:48:29,260 --> 04:48:31,730
That's dangerous, geez

10227
04:48:30,740 --> 04:48:31,730
Come on man

10228
04:48:38,430 --> 04:48:38,600
Scary!

10229
04:48:38,600 --> 04:48:38,770
Scary!

10230
04:48:38,770 --> 04:48:38,930
Scary!

10231
04:48:38,930 --> 04:48:39,370
Scary!

10232
04:48:39,370 --> 04:48:39,800
Scary!

10233
04:48:39,800 --> 04:48:40,100
Scary!

10234
04:48:40,100 --> 04:48:41,240
Scary!

10235
04:48:41,240 --> 04:48:41,970
So, everyone

23725
04:54:12,090 --> 04:54:14,160
Thanks

23726
04:54:14,630 --> 04:54:16,960
Thank you very much

23727
04:54:15,800 --> 04:54:18,660
Looks like the new year arrived while we were watching the video

23728
04:54:18,330 --> 04:54:18,900
Yes!

23729
04:54:18,710 --> 04:54:20,970
So, happy new year to everyone

23730
04:54:19,930 --> 04:54:21,130
Happy new year!

23731
04:54:20,320 --> 04:54:22,020
Happy new year!

23732
04:54:23,520 --> 04:54:24,690
A new year has begun

23733
04:54:25,590 --> 04:54:27,390
We went through quite a lot this year

23734
04:54:26,770 --> 04:54:27,540
Yeah

23735
04:54:27,190 --> 04:54:28,210
We did

23736
04:54:28,010 --> 04:54:30,330
Ended up being you again, Hosei

23737
04:54:29,680 --> 04:54:30,610
Yeah

23738
04:54:31,090 --> 04:54:32,330
Indeed

23739
04:54:31,710 --> 04:54:32,560
Chono's slap

23740
04:54:32,610 --> 04:54:35,230
Were you happy when you thought it'd be Matsumoto?

23741
04:54:35,260 --> 04:54:38,990
If you looked at the staff, they were apologizing profusely to Matsumoto-san

23742
04:54:36,570 --> 04:54:38,450
True

23743
04:54:39,590 --> 04:54:41,390
So I thought "We're really seeing this!"

23744
04:54:44,310 --> 04:54:45,680
You were happy?

23745
04:54:45,270 --> 04:54:46,590
So happy!

23746
04:54:45,740 --> 04:54:47,780
He was!

23747
04:54:46,240 --> 04:54:47,730
He really was

23748
04:54:47,980 --> 04:54:50,500
In the end, I wouldn't mind if they did it to me, but...

23749
04:54:50,500 --> 04:54:53,050
Hosei saying: "That blonde guy, please slap him too!" was too much

23750
04:54:53,520 --> 04:54:55,580
It's not gonna hurt any less for you, you know

23751
04:54:55,790 --> 04:54:57,520
It won't, but, I'd like you guys to feel it

23752
04:54:57,520 --> 04:55:01,420
It's something you've never experienced

23753
04:55:00,910 --> 04:55:02,210
That's true

23754
04:55:01,720 --> 04:55:02,940
Well...

23755
04:55:02,730 --> 04:55:04,410
And that's the end

23756
04:55:04,640 --> 04:55:08,730
Hopefully you'll continue to enjoy Gaki no Tsukai in 2018!

23757
04:55:15,490 --> 04:55:21,500
Everything shown was fiction.

23758
04:55:15,490 --> 04:55:21,500
Including names, institutions, buildings and so forth.
