00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,900
Green Room

2
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:01,220
This was a long drive

3
00:00:03,660 --> 00:00:05,260
DOWNTOWN

4
00:00:03,660 --> 00:00:05,260
HAMADA MASATOSHI

5
00:00:05,260 --> 00:00:09,420
I couldn't find this place
- I'm with you, my GPS didn't find it either

6
00:00:10,020 --> 00:00:11,620
I was expecting a more posh place

7
00:00:11,300 --> 00:00:13,380
YAMASAKI HOSEI

8
00:00:13,380 --> 00:00:15,060
I drove by a bunch of industrial warehouses

9
00:00:15,140 --> 00:00:18,900
COCORICO

10
00:00:15,140 --> 00:00:18,900
ENDO SHOZO

11
00:00:15,140 --> 00:00:18,900
TANAKA NAOKI

12
00:00:21,060 --> 00:00:27,140
First Annual Gaki No Tsukai Ya Arahende!!
Chiki Chiki "Mom, My @#$% Hurts!!"

13
00:00:33,180 --> 00:00:35,740
No need for your mom to be involved really

14
00:00:35,740 --> 00:00:36,380
DOWNTOWN

15
00:00:35,740 --> 00:00:36,380
MATSUMOTO HITOSHI

16
00:00:36,380 --> 00:00:37,500
As I promised last week

17
00:00:38,060 --> 00:00:39,220
I brought the medicine

18
00:00:40,380 --> 00:00:43,740
An Experiment To See How Much
the Medicine Will Hurt Everyone

19
00:00:45,300 --> 00:00:48,460
I just want you guys to know
that I wasn't making it up

20
00:00:48,580 --> 00:00:50,940
My balls were itching the other day

21
00:00:51,660 --> 00:00:54,300
So I headed to the pharmacy
and picked up this medicine

22
00:00:54,500 --> 00:00:56,140
And when I applied just a drop of this

23
00:00:56,700 --> 00:00:57,500
Holy Jesus!!

24
00:00:57,700 --> 00:01:00,540
It knocked the wind outta me!

25
00:01:00,660 --> 00:01:02,180
Seriously

26
00:01:02,180 --> 00:01:04,020
I felt this high pitched
Peeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeee

27
00:01:06,140 --> 00:01:07,420
That's hilarious

28
00:01:07,660 --> 00:01:09,900
I'm not kiddin'
I was like this
Ahhhhggghhhh!!!!

29
00:01:10,500 --> 00:01:13,940
Then I'm all
Ummmmmmmmmmmmmmm

30
00:01:13,940 --> 00:01:16,020
Peeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeee!!!

31
00:01:17,500 --> 00:01:19,740
It really does kill
- This is no joke

32
00:01:20,060 --> 00:01:23,500
My guess is that Nostradamus
knew this was coming

33
00:01:26,500 --> 00:01:28,900
This is a real medicine
you can buy over-the-counter

34
00:01:29,300 --> 00:01:32,300
I haven't added anything funny to it

35
00:01:32,300 --> 00:01:34,180
Let me see it
Yeah, it's for ringworm

36
00:01:35,340 --> 00:01:36,660
Who should start then...

37
00:01:36,540 --> 00:01:37,940
Tanaka

38
00:01:53,580 --> 00:01:58,380
* Not harmful to your body

39
00:01:55,740 --> 00:01:56,820
You put a lot

40
00:02:00,500 --> 00:02:02,340
Hot!

41
00:02:02,780 --> 00:02:04,300
You serious?
- Serious?

42
00:02:05,660 --> 00:02:07,420
Serious?
- Yeah

43
00:02:08,340 --> 00:02:09,820
You're bullshitting

44
00:02:10,180 --> 00:02:10,940
It's really hot!

45
00:02:12,820 --> 00:02:16,060
It's hot?
- It really does makes you that way

46
00:02:16,380 --> 00:02:17,860
You just become immobile

47
00:02:17,980 --> 00:02:20,020
What's the matter?
- It's hot!

48
00:02:20,700 --> 00:02:21,620
It's hot?
- Yes

49
00:02:22,700 --> 00:02:25,060
Does it hurt?
- No, it's hot, really hot

50
00:02:26,420 --> 00:02:27,860
It's just hot!

51
00:02:29,740 --> 00:02:31,780
This is what you can expect

52
00:02:32,380 --> 00:02:34,500
Once it gets in your skin,
it burns and becomes really hot!

53
00:02:36,260 --> 00:02:39,780
Anybody wanting to step up
to this challenge is welcome

54
00:02:40,020 --> 00:02:43,500
How about over there, professional
Lighting-Man

55
00:02:47,980 --> 00:02:50,860
Coolest mustache in the
Lighting Department

56
00:02:51,300 --> 00:02:55,300

Mr. MIURA

58
00:02:56,980 --> 00:02:59,980
I bet he had no idea this
would happen to him

59
00:03:01,620 --> 00:03:02,940
How about Motoichi then

60
00:03:04,380 --> 00:03:06,980
MOTOICHI

61
00:03:04,380 --> 00:03:06,980
WRITER

62
00:03:07,380 --> 00:03:11,180
Keep thinking you're looking
nice with your sports jacket
Come over here

63
00:03:13,420 --> 00:03:15,860
Whatever you do,
keep it away from your face

64
00:03:16,780 --> 00:03:18,180
Good luck

65
00:03:17,580 --> 00:03:19,660
Isn't this too much?
- No

66
00:03:19,940 --> 00:03:27,500
Serious?

67
00:03:27,500 --> 00:03:29,700
No two should react the same, right?

68
00:03:29,780 --> 00:03:32,060
Ouch
@%$^&*#$%^@@$%^*!!!!

69
00:03:33,620 --> 00:03:35,820
Where're you going?

70
00:03:36,500 --> 00:03:37,420
Nice face!

71
00:03:40,660 --> 00:03:41,980
What's with his face?

72
00:03:46,420 --> 00:03:47,060
You OK?

73
00:03:47,420 --> 00:03:51,140
He's not kidding around
You just can't make any kind
of movement like this

74
00:03:51,540 --> 00:03:52,700
This stuff is insane

75
00:03:53,380 --> 00:03:55,380
Let me try it

76
00:03:57,900 --> 00:04:00,180
After seeing all that,
I gotta try it

77
00:04:07,780 --> 00:04:09,580
No idea how this guy's gonna react

78
00:04:11,980 --> 00:04:13,380
Wait for it

79
00:04:16,180 --> 00:04:17,780
What?

80
00:04:19,380 --> 00:04:20,420
What is...

81
00:04:23,580 --> 00:04:24,660
It's getting warm

82
00:04:24,820 --> 00:04:26,780
It's getting..

83
00:04:44,340 --> 00:04:45,020
Serious
This hurts!!

84
00:04:49,460 --> 00:04:50,860
How long does this last!?

85
00:04:52,180 --> 00:04:53,580
When is this OVER!!??

86
00:04:54,620 --> 00:04:56,020
Ouch Ouch Ouch Ouch
Ouch Ouch Ouch Ouch

87
00:04:56,900 --> 00:04:59,020
You're sweating hard
- Look at the sweat!!!

88
00:05:03,540 --> 00:05:04,700
Not good
Not good at all

89
00:05:08,180 --> 00:05:10,700
Anybody watching this show...

90
00:05:11,060 --> 00:05:12,260
Where can I wash this off?!

91
00:05:12,940 --> 00:05:14,180
I have to get this off!

92
00:05:14,340 --> 00:05:18,580
Some viewers are probably skeptical
about what's happening here

93
00:05:19,020 --> 00:05:20,340
But this is for REAL!

94
00:05:21,140 --> 00:05:22,500
Ouch Ouch Ouch Ouch Ouch Ouch!!!!

95
00:05:23,380 --> 00:05:24,580
I'm sweating again!

96
00:05:27,300 --> 00:05:28,500
That HURT....

97
00:05:30,500 --> 00:05:32,020
I will never doubt you again

98
00:05:34,340 --> 00:05:36,700
Alright, next up
Heipo, you're up

99
00:05:37,900 --> 00:05:40,900
DIRECTOR

100
00:05:37,900 --> 00:05:40,900
Saito Toshihide (HEIPO)

101
00:05:41,660 --> 00:05:43,620
Let's have two of you
Yamasaki and Heipo

102
00:05:44,900 --> 00:05:46,780
At the same time?
- Yea, like a tag team

103
00:05:47,740 --> 00:05:50,500
* Not harmful to your body

104
00:05:50,500 --> 00:05:52,460
Are you guys ready?
Go for it

105
00:06:18,180 --> 00:06:19,500
I put too much on

106
00:06:20,540 --> 00:06:21,260
Way too much

107
00:06:28,700 --> 00:06:33,020
One common reaction is that
nobody can sit up with it

108
00:06:33,940 --> 00:06:35,180
You're so floored

109
00:06:36,140 --> 00:06:38,180
I'm OK with it
- You're kidding??

110
00:06:38,740 --> 00:06:40,980
It feels rather soothing

111
00:06:44,340 --> 00:06:45,740
We're all different, I guess

112
00:06:45,900 --> 00:06:47,580
Why don't we go all at once?

113
00:06:47,900 --> 00:06:48,900
Like ten of us

114
00:06:49,060 --> 00:06:51,340
It mean all you guys in the back, too

115
00:06:53,500 --> 00:06:55,100
Go ahead and rub it on

116
00:06:57,380 --> 00:06:59,940
All of you guys should have
different reactions to this

117
00:07:11,380 --> 00:07:13,380
Awesome Kodak moment!

118
00:07:15,460 --> 00:07:17,980
What is this, a new religious ritual??

119
00:07:25,340 --> 00:07:26,700
Ouch-Ouch-ism

120
00:07:28,900 --> 00:07:29,940
Well, that should do it

121
00:07:31,180 --> 00:07:33,340
Or, shall I go

122
00:07:33,660 --> 00:07:35,180
Now??

123
00:07:35,780 --> 00:07:40,620
After that orgy we just witnessed,
It's definitely a tough act to follow

124
00:07:40,620 --> 00:07:42,660
I don't wanna kill the buzz

125
00:08:19,180 --> 00:08:21,900
His pain threshold is not that great

126
00:08:24,980 --> 00:08:27,180
He's rather a baby when it comes to the pain

127
00:08:27,580 --> 00:08:29,660
This medicine got the most outta you

128
00:08:33,180 --> 00:08:35,740
THE PAIN OF THE DAY
