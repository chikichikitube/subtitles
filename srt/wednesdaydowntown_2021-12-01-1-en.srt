00:00:07,390 --> 00:00:10,390
Today, we have a
big crowd of presenters

8
00:00:10,390 --> 00:00:12,390
Come in!

9
00:00:16,400 --> 00:00:18,900
Ah, it's true, wow

10
00:00:18,900 --> 00:00:20,900
So many of them

11
00:00:20,900 --> 00:00:25,900
Yes, it's Chocolate Planet,
Kotōge, and Kasuga!

12
00:00:21,100 --> 00:00:24,540

Presenters

20
00:00:25,900 --> 00:00:28,410
Hello!

21
00:00:25,900 --> 00:00:28,410
Toose!

22
00:00:28,410 --> 00:00:30,910
Well, this lineup means that...

23
00:00:30,910 --> 00:00:33,250
It's what we look forward to
every half period:

24
00:00:33,250 --> 00:00:37,320
Everyone's Theories
Special

25
00:00:37,320 --> 00:00:48,260

26
00:00:52,930 --> 00:00:55,430
I'll start →

27
00:00:52,930 --> 00:00:55,430
OK, who's first?

28
00:00:55,430 --> 00:00:58,440
if that's okay with everyone.
So everyone--

29
00:00:58,440 --> 00:01:00,870
There was a bit of a tussle there

30
00:01:00,870 --> 00:01:02,870
Like a little skit

31
00:01:02,840 --> 00:01:04,210
Anything funny...?

32
00:01:04,210 --> 00:01:06,210
Ah well,

33
00:01:04,210 --> 00:01:06,210
Chocopla were silent but...

34
00:01:06,210 --> 00:01:08,550
Could we go first please?

35
00:01:08,550 --> 00:01:10,550
Hold on...

36
00:01:08,550 --> 00:01:10,550
Is that okay? We...

37
00:01:10,550 --> 00:01:13,050
I'll go first

38
00:01:10,550 --> 00:01:13,050
Well...

39
00:01:13,050 --> 00:01:15,050
Um...

40
00:01:14,320 --> 00:01:16,090
I did say funny, right?

41
00:01:17,390 --> 00:01:19,390
Didn't you hear me?

42
00:01:17,390 --> 00:01:19,390
Matsumoto-san

43
00:01:19,060 --> 00:01:22,130
Could you break their right arms, please?

44
00:01:21,890 --> 00:01:23,900
Not anymore

45
00:01:21,890 --> 00:01:23,900
You don't need them, do you?

46
00:01:23,900 --> 00:01:28,230
(Kasuga) They don't

47
00:01:23,900 --> 00:01:28,230
You don't need arms like that

48
00:01:28,230 --> 00:01:31,240
So everyone,
you've probably already noticed but →

49
00:01:31,240 --> 00:01:36,070
one theory has already started

50
00:01:34,240 --> 00:01:37,040
And it's this:

51
00:01:34,240 --> 00:01:37,040
Oh, really?

52
00:01:37,210 --> 00:01:42,410
Theory: When hit by an actress light on maximum, you can't be identified

53
00:01:44,920 --> 00:01:49,250
It's been bothering me for a while.
It's hard for me too

54
00:01:49,250 --> 00:01:53,330
I think everyone knows
what an actress light is but

55
00:01:53,330 --> 00:01:56,930
It's often used by
older actresses

56
00:01:54,230 --> 00:02:04,000
Actress light: A common name for illumination that lights up your face to hide wrinkles and make your skin look better

57
00:01:56,930 --> 00:01:58,930
and is a bright light

58
00:01:58,930 --> 00:02:01,870
that gets rid of wrinkles and
makes skin look better.

59
00:02:01,870 --> 00:02:03,870
So this actress light,

60
00:02:03,870 --> 00:02:05,940
What do you think?

61
00:02:05,940 --> 00:02:08,870
How does this look on screen?

62
00:02:08,870 --> 00:02:11,180
Here it is on the monitor

63
00:02:13,550 --> 00:02:16,210
(Fujii) It does it that much?

64
00:02:13,550 --> 00:02:16,210
Wow!

65
00:02:16,210 --> 00:02:18,520
I never knew

66
00:02:16,210 --> 00:02:18,520
That's amazing

67
00:02:18,450 --> 00:02:21,520
Like a luminous body

68
00:02:21,290 --> 00:02:23,890
It's emitting light, isn't it?

69
00:02:23,890 --> 00:02:26,890
But if I'm looking like this you're visible

70
00:02:23,890 --> 00:02:26,890
That's how it is

71
00:02:26,890 --> 00:02:29,900
And so for all our viewers

72
00:02:26,890 --> 00:02:29,900
Yes we see you

73
00:02:29,900 --> 00:02:35,230
we'd like you to predict
her identity for a while.

74
00:02:35,230 --> 00:02:39,910
And we'll play the VTR
with you like that too

75
00:02:39,910 --> 00:02:43,410
"Who's this actress in the corner?"

76
00:02:43,410 --> 00:02:46,080
While wondering who it could be

77
00:02:46,080 --> 00:02:49,410
they can enjoy the VTR too

78
00:02:49,410 --> 00:02:51,920
Really? OK

79
00:02:49,410 --> 00:02:51,920
The VTR of Everyone's Theories that I chose

80
00:02:51,920 --> 00:02:54,020
Here they are!

81
00:02:54,090 --> 00:03:00,090
Everyone's Theories
as chosen by Kotōge

82
00:02:57,990 --> 00:02:59,990
First it's...

83
00:03:00,090 --> 00:03:07,000
Theory: The scariest thing is if a person is there after turning the power on after a power cut

84
00:03:07,300 --> 00:03:10,870
The target this time is...

85
00:03:11,100 --> 00:03:14,110
A regular of the "a person's there" series,

86
00:03:11,170 --> 00:03:15,370
Anthony

87
00:03:11,170 --> 00:03:15,370
Matenrou

88
00:03:18,880 --> 00:03:24,620
He watches TV while playing
with his phone for 30 minutes

89
00:03:27,550 --> 00:03:30,220
While a relaxed Anthony→

90
00:03:30,220 --> 00:03:32,920
is in the toilet...

91
00:03:30,320 --> 00:03:35,490
Toilet

92
00:03:38,160 --> 00:03:41,830
Closet

93
00:03:38,300 --> 00:03:41,800
A man hidden in the closet

94
00:03:42,230 --> 00:03:46,370
trips the breaker so it seems
there was a power cut

95
00:03:49,310 --> 00:03:50,610
Huh?

96
00:03:51,740 --> 00:03:53,510
What?

97
00:03:53,980 --> 00:03:59,020
Huh? Oh... so dark

98
00:03:59,420 --> 00:04:01,550
The breaker's tripped

99
00:04:02,420 --> 00:04:04,420
Sure enough...

100
00:04:19,070 --> 00:04:20,540
Who? Who?

101
00:04:20,540 --> 00:04:22,470
Who are you? Who are you?

102
00:04:23,170 --> 00:04:25,240
No, this is so so so scary

103
00:04:25,510 --> 00:04:27,650
Is this Suiyoubi? Is it?

104
00:04:27,650 --> 00:04:29,450
Downtown?

105
00:04:29,510 --> 00:04:32,750
Prank Reveal

106
00:04:32,920 --> 00:04:35,950
This is pretty bad you know

107
00:04:35,950 --> 00:04:38,620
What is this?

108
00:04:38,620 --> 00:04:40,060
I mean really...

109
00:04:40,060 --> 00:04:42,930
But what a relief. I was so scared

110
00:04:42,930 --> 00:04:45,030
It would've been so bad if it weren't Suiyoubi

111
00:04:45,030 --> 00:04:47,070
And um

112
00:04:47,070 --> 00:04:49,200
Could you use the person you usually use?

113
00:04:49,700 --> 00:04:53,510
It was someone completely different and I didn't know who it was

114
00:04:53,510 --> 00:04:57,210
It wasn't the usual guy so I was like ... 'who?'

115
00:04:57,210 --> 00:04:58,480
'Is he just some weird guy?'

116
00:04:58,480 --> 00:05:00,850
And why am I holding an umbrella?

117
00:05:00,850 --> 00:05:01,780
When...

118
00:05:01,780 --> 00:05:07,790
Everyone's Theories
as chosen by Kotōge

119
00:05:01,780 --> 00:05:08,020
Next, it's...

120
00:05:07,790 --> 00:05:14,790
Theory: a pro wrestler can keep his fountain opponent down until the count of three

121
00:05:15,030 --> 00:05:19,630
And so, our challenger is...

122
00:05:19,630 --> 00:05:22,170
Pleased to meet you

123
00:05:19,630 --> 00:05:22,170
Staff) Pleased to meet you

124
00:05:23,540 --> 00:05:39,120
Pro Wrestling NOAH's

Marufuji Naomichi

125
00:05:23,870 --> 00:05:27,370
A top wrestler, affliated with
Pro Wrestling NOAH, it's...

126
00:05:27,370 --> 00:05:29,370
Marufuji Naomichi

127
00:05:30,380 --> 00:05:32,880
And his opponent is:

128
00:05:30,540 --> 00:05:39,120
Ōiso Long Beach's

Fountain ( Height 4m)

129
00:05:32,880 --> 00:05:38,320
A fountain at Ōiso Long Beach,
with a height of 4 meters

130
00:05:39,480 --> 00:05:46,930
Q. How do you feel about your opponent?

131
00:05:42,620 --> 00:05:44,160
It's quite something

132
00:05:44,160 --> 00:05:46,930
It's a very assertive opponent, isn't it?

133
00:05:47,230 --> 00:05:50,900
Well, Marufuji is now
going over the rope→

134
00:05:50,900 --> 00:05:52,900
and is in the ring.

135
00:05:53,900 --> 00:05:56,230
This is a no-time-limit match

136
00:05:56,230 --> 00:05:58,240
and will consist of a single round.

137
00:05:58,240 --> 00:06:01,040
Who will the winner be?

138
00:06:01,510 --> 00:06:02,910
Alright, let's go

139
00:06:05,410 --> 00:06:48,890
Pro Wrestling NOAH's

Marufuji Naomichi

140
00:06:05,410 --> 00:06:48,890
Ōiso Long Beach's

Fountain

141
00:06:05,840 --> 00:06:08,850
The starting gong has rung!

142
00:06:08,850 --> 00:06:12,180
Right now, the
fountain has fallen.

143
00:06:12,180 --> 00:06:15,890
If he can get the 3-count
it's victory for Marufuji

144
00:06:16,990 --> 00:06:17,860
Let's go!

145
00:06:17,860 --> 00:06:18,660
Come on!

146
00:06:18,860 --> 00:06:22,360
One, tw-

147
00:06:18,860 --> 00:06:22,360
There goes Marufuji

148
00:06:23,360 --> 00:06:25,360
He's been flipped over!

149
00:06:25,360 --> 00:06:27,370
One, two-

150
00:06:27,370 --> 00:06:29,870
Ahh, he's been flipped over

151
00:06:30,870 --> 00:06:32,870
(Referee) One, tw--

152
00:06:32,870 --> 00:06:35,210
He's been flipped over!

153
00:06:35,210 --> 00:06:37,540
He got to the count of 2.9

154
00:06:37,540 --> 00:06:40,880
Flipped over at 2.9!

155
00:06:42,880 --> 00:06:48,150
The fountain is victorious!
Marufuji's challenge failed

156
00:06:48,890 --> 00:06:54,890
Everyone's Theories
as chosen by Kotōge

157
00:06:52,890 --> 00:06:54,890
Next, it's...

158
00:06:54,890 --> 00:07:00,630
Theory: There are no houses in Odaiba
(TL note: artificial island in Tokyo Bay)

159
00:07:00,830 --> 00:07:02,830
And so...

160
00:07:02,400 --> 00:07:04,040
Staff) Good morning

161
00:07:02,900 --> 00:07:04,040
Good morning

162
00:07:04,340 --> 00:07:09,840
Akatsu, who's familiar with earning money on foot, will walk around and investigate

163
00:07:10,280 --> 00:07:11,880
Ah, you don't see them, do you?

164
00:07:11,880 --> 00:07:14,010
It's all just multi-story buildings

165
00:07:14,310 --> 00:07:17,680
So I'll probably just be walking around all day

166
00:07:17,950 --> 00:07:21,590
Investigation start

167
00:07:21,590 --> 00:07:24,420
I'm usually looking down when I'm walking

168
00:07:24,420 --> 00:07:26,690
I'm happy I'm looking for something big today

169
00:07:26,690 --> 00:07:28,990
No, it's just big buildings so far

170
00:07:28,990 --> 00:07:31,060
Just multi-story buildings everywhere

171
00:07:31,360 --> 00:07:34,800
As expected, the only
thing he sees are...

172
00:07:33,130 --> 00:07:37,640
towers and commercial property.

173
00:07:35,030 --> 00:07:37,040
But...

174
00:07:38,370 --> 00:07:40,370
Isn't that a house? Over there

175
00:07:40,370 --> 00:07:41,470
Look

176
00:07:43,110 --> 00:07:46,540
That's a proper house, isn't it?

177
00:07:46,880 --> 00:07:49,180
But, after having a proper look...

178
00:07:49,410 --> 00:07:53,520
This building and ship are connected

179
00:07:53,650 --> 00:07:55,650
Ah! "Museum of Maritime Science"

180
00:07:55,890 --> 00:07:57,890
And then...

181
00:07:57,920 --> 00:08:01,030
Isn't that a house?

182
00:08:01,160 --> 00:08:03,660
Oh no

183
00:08:03,660 --> 00:08:09,530
It's not. Tokyo Bureau of Sewerage

184
00:08:07,570 --> 00:08:09,530
Tokyo Metropolitan Government Bureau of Sewerage



Aomi Wharf Pump Station

185
00:08:09,830 --> 00:08:11,840
Apart from those 2 buildings,

186
00:08:11,840 --> 00:08:14,510
he finds no other buildings
that look like a house.

187
00:08:14,110 --> 00:08:19,040
8 hours since
filming started

188
00:08:21,180 --> 00:08:23,680
This soft cream..
is really..

189
00:08:23,680 --> 00:08:26,350
Umahooooo!
(combining the words 'tasty' and 'phoenix')

190
00:08:26,350 --> 00:08:30,320
All that remains is
this area

191
00:08:30,890 --> 00:08:32,520
What was that just now?

192
00:08:32,860 --> 00:08:34,860
And then...

193
00:08:35,030 --> 00:08:37,300
You're currently living in Odaiba?

194
00:08:36,190 --> 00:08:37,300
Yes

195
00:08:37,300 --> 00:08:41,100
And do you live in an apartment or a house?

196
00:08:41,100 --> 00:08:44,970
There are no houses in Odaiba

197
00:08:43,700 --> 00:08:45,940
There are no houses in Odaiba?

198
00:08:44,970 --> 00:08:45,940
No there aren't

199
00:08:46,600 --> 00:08:48,170
Are you positive about that?

200
00:08:47,740 --> 00:08:48,170
I am

201
00:08:48,170 --> 00:08:49,710
Do you have any idea why?

202
00:08:49,710 --> 00:08:53,180
It's probably because the city made it all

203
00:08:53,280 --> 00:08:56,780
It's the city's so you can't buy any land?

204
00:08:55,750 --> 00:08:56,780
No you can't

205
00:08:56,780 --> 00:08:59,020
So you can't build a house

206
00:08:58,220 --> 00:08:59,020
Correct

207
00:08:59,020 --> 00:09:07,990
Apartment block
construction allowed

208
00:08:59,020 --> 00:09:07,990
No residential
buildings allowed

209
00:08:59,220 --> 00:09:02,220
That's right. The
city planning regulations

210
00:09:00,290 --> 00:09:07,990
do not permit the construction of houses, meaning it is impossible to build one in Odaiba

211
00:09:08,090 --> 00:09:10,060
That would've been easy to research

212
00:09:09,830 --> 00:09:11,830
I know, right?

213
00:09:12,030 --> 00:09:14,530
You can only buy apartments in that building

214
00:09:14,530 --> 00:09:17,370
Only the top part is for sale

215
00:09:17,370 --> 00:09:20,570
Is that so...? Wow...

216
00:09:20,570 --> 00:09:26,580
Everyone's Theories
as chosen by Kotōge

217
00:09:24,840 --> 00:09:26,840
Next it's...

218
00:09:26,580 --> 00:09:34,250
If it's over the phone even an old fart can make the person on the other end think he's a child

219
00:09:34,850 --> 00:09:36,960
For this investigation,

220
00:09:37,960 --> 00:09:45,360
Kaito-kun (age 7)

221
00:09:37,960 --> 00:09:56,440
Yura-kun (age 7)

222
00:09:38,190 --> 00:09:42,860
We'll have Kaito-kun
call his friend Yura-kun

223
00:09:42,860 --> 00:09:44,860
During the call,

224
00:09:45,400 --> 00:09:56,440
Yasuo-kun (age 88)

225
00:09:45,860 --> 00:09:51,270
he'll hand the phone over to Yasuo-kun, an 88-year old pretending to be a child→

226
00:09:51,270 --> 00:09:55,370
and we'll find out if he can
make him think he's a child.

227
00:09:56,870 --> 00:09:59,880
So let's get started

228
00:10:03,180 --> 00:10:04,720
What's up, Kaito-kun?

229
00:10:05,320 --> 00:10:07,420
What are you doing now, Kaito-kun?

230
00:10:07,650 --> 00:10:10,020
I'm at home now

231
00:10:10,690 --> 00:10:15,790
Is it okay if my friend Yasuo-kun comes over to play?

232
00:10:15,790 --> 00:10:16,830
Sure

233
00:10:17,130 --> 00:10:21,200
Really? Well he's here with me now so

234
00:10:21,200 --> 00:10:22,370
I'll give him the phone

235
00:10:22,930 --> 00:10:24,000
OK

236
00:10:24,400 --> 00:10:26,400
What will happen?

237
00:10:28,240 --> 00:10:29,610
How do you do?

238
00:10:32,440 --> 00:10:34,080
It's Yasuo

239
00:10:34,380 --> 00:10:36,680
Are you Kaito-kun's friend?

240
00:10:38,020 --> 00:10:39,180
Yep

241
00:10:39,420 --> 00:10:42,950
So what are you doing there?

242
00:10:41,350 --> 00:10:42,950
Playing a game

243
00:10:43,190 --> 00:10:45,860
Battle Cats

244
00:10:46,420 --> 00:10:48,990
Ah, I've got that you know

245
00:10:48,190 --> 00:10:48,990
Oh

246
00:10:49,290 --> 00:10:52,700
Let's play it together

247
00:10:52,700 --> 00:10:54,170
Sure

248
00:10:54,400 --> 00:11:00,000
Can I come play at your house next time?

249
00:11:00,000 --> 00:11:02,040
Sure

250
00:11:00,870 --> 00:11:02,040
OK

251
00:11:02,210 --> 00:11:05,110
I'm giving Kaito-kun the phone, OK?

252
00:11:05,110 --> 00:11:06,910
OK

253
00:11:07,250 --> 00:11:10,850
So next time we'll go play with Yasuo-kun, OK?

254
00:11:09,710 --> 00:11:10,850
Yeah

255
00:11:11,250 --> 00:11:13,620
Do you think you could be friends with him?

256
00:11:14,120 --> 00:11:16,050
I think so

257
00:11:16,320 --> 00:11:20,020
He didn't notice at all

258
00:11:20,320 --> 00:11:24,430
Hikaru-chan (age 8)

259
00:11:20,320 --> 00:11:24,430
Yasuo-kun (age 88)

260
00:11:20,320 --> 00:11:24,430
Youko-chan (age 8)

261
00:11:20,390 --> 00:11:23,860
But when it comes to
a girl who's one year older...

262
00:11:25,460 --> 00:11:28,400
This is Yasuo!

263
00:11:28,400 --> 00:11:31,770
Yasuo?

264
00:11:31,770 --> 00:11:33,500
Are you really?

265
00:11:33,910 --> 00:11:36,440
Yasuo

266
00:11:36,570 --> 00:11:39,040
Hey, mom. Seriously...

267
00:11:39,040 --> 00:11:41,710
His voice is totally wrong

268
00:11:43,680 --> 00:11:45,220
She's so grossed out

269
00:11:45,220 --> 00:11:49,490
His voice is so strange for someone his age

270
00:11:49,920 --> 00:11:51,920
Then...

271
00:11:52,790 --> 00:11:58,130
Hey, Youko. Is Yasuo-kun really there?

272
00:11:58,130 --> 00:12:02,470
Are you sure? Is he really really really really there?

273
00:11:58,430 --> 00:12:00,430
Yep

274
00:12:02,470 --> 00:12:07,940
And so, the result is that we made her think he's a spiritual being

275
00:12:07,940 --> 00:12:09,870
I see

276
00:12:09,870 --> 00:12:13,880
She was scared, wasn't she?
She could tell something was off

277
00:12:13,880 --> 00:12:16,210
Spiritual was a very
accurate word to use

278
00:12:16,210 --> 00:12:18,880
Right? It's like 'Am I the
only one who hears him?'

279
00:12:18,880 --> 00:12:20,990
That's how she felt

280
00:12:21,350 --> 00:12:25,020
But we don't know if he's really there or not

281
00:12:22,950 --> 00:12:26,890
That's scary. Seriously,
he was on screen so much

282
00:12:26,890 --> 00:12:30,230
Because he was so clearly
on screen for so long

283
00:12:30,230 --> 00:12:33,300
Karen-chan, what did you think?

284
00:12:30,230 --> 00:12:33,300
They were all fantastic but→

285
00:12:33,300 --> 00:12:36,570
But in the end the
first was just too funny

286
00:12:35,570 --> 00:12:45,840
Theory: The scariest thing is if a person is there after turning the power on after a power cut

287
00:12:36,570 --> 00:12:39,570
Having him in a t-shirt
was just perfect

288
00:12:39,570 --> 00:12:42,410
If it were a suit, the reaction
would've been different

289
00:12:42,410 --> 00:12:45,410
I see, I see

290
00:12:42,410 --> 00:12:45,410
and it would've been a mistake.

291
00:12:45,410 --> 00:12:47,910
So you're saying
it was just right

292
00:12:47,910 --> 00:12:52,250
Fujii-san, how about you?

293
00:12:47,910 --> 00:12:52,250
The theory that there are no houses in Odaiba

294
00:12:52,250 --> 00:12:54,590
When there's such a clear reason

295
00:12:52,780 --> 00:12:58,360
Theory: There are no houses in Odaiba

296
00:12:54,590 --> 00:12:58,420
That's right

297
00:12:54,590 --> 00:12:58,420
they could've found out straightaway

298
00:12:58,420 --> 00:13:02,190
During that ice cream thing, Matsumoto-san was saying 'we don't need that!'

299
00:13:02,190 --> 00:13:04,900
But he was walking around
for 8 hours so...

300
00:13:03,860 --> 00:13:06,900
Please put up with it just once

301
00:13:07,230 --> 00:13:09,570
"Umahoo"

302
00:13:07,270 --> 00:13:09,530
Just once...

303
00:13:07,270 --> 00:13:09,530
Please endure it

304
00:13:09,530 --> 00:13:12,040
What is that? Is saying
umaho trendy now?

305
00:13:12,040 --> 00:13:14,040
No no,
it's not trendy

306
00:13:14,010 --> 00:13:16,840
And it's never going to be

307
00:13:16,710 --> 00:13:20,780
Well now, she was always
completely white in the corner

308
00:13:20,780 --> 00:13:24,780
but it's time to reveal the actress

309
00:13:24,780 --> 00:13:26,700
who was lit up by the actress light.

310
00:13:26,700 --> 00:13:29,090
Lighting person, if you would

311
00:13:30,790 --> 00:13:35,090
Here we go.
The answer was Satō Hitomi-san!

312
00:13:31,020 --> 00:13:37,760
Satō Hitomi

313
00:13:38,800 --> 00:13:41,070
How long was that on for?

314
00:13:41,070 --> 00:13:43,900
We did it for a pretty
long time, didn't we?

315
00:13:43,900 --> 00:13:45,900
I can't see properly right now

316
00:13:45,900 --> 00:13:48,240
I'm not surprised

317
00:13:45,900 --> 00:13:48,240
Your eyes are messed up

318
00:13:48,240 --> 00:13:51,910
My eyes are shot.
Seriously.

319
00:13:51,910 --> 00:13:53,910
Next, it's...

320
00:13:52,080 --> 00:13:57,550
Everyone's Theories
as chosen by Chocopla

321
00:13:57,420 --> 00:14:00,850
Here are the theories we've chosen

322
00:14:00,850 --> 00:14:05,520
Theory: If put on hold you'll wait 10 minutes
even if it's a call from your senpai

323
00:14:07,860 --> 00:14:11,200
It happens

324
00:14:07,860 --> 00:14:11,200
They'll be put on hold

325
00:14:11,200 --> 00:14:15,100
How about you Fujii-san?
Say Hamada-san called you→

326
00:14:15,100 --> 00:14:16,700
and said hold on
a moment,

327
00:14:16,700 --> 00:14:19,400
how many minutes
would you wait?

328
00:14:19,600 --> 00:14:22,310
I couldn't wait for 10 minutes

329
00:14:21,370 --> 00:14:24,380
10 minutes is long

330
00:14:21,370 --> 00:14:24,380
10 minutes is long!

331
00:14:24,380 --> 00:14:26,480
It would be like 'Has he collapsed?'

332
00:14:26,610 --> 00:14:28,780
Or passed away...

333
00:14:27,450 --> 00:14:31,220
Hey!

334
00:14:27,450 --> 00:14:31,220
You'd just be worried

335
00:14:31,220 --> 00:14:33,550
If he usually doesn't
make you wait that long

336
00:14:33,550 --> 00:14:35,950
(Fujii) He doesn't

337
00:14:33,550 --> 00:14:35,950
I see, I see

338
00:14:35,850 --> 00:14:42,830
Theory: If put on hold you'll wait 10 minutes
even if it's a call from your senpai

339
00:14:42,630 --> 00:14:44,630

hang up immediately

349

as our three entries

351
00:14:55,240 --> 00:15:00,910
It's time to call the kōhais,
who've been invited over
for a fake show

352
00:15:01,650 --> 00:15:03,510
OK, I'm calling now

353
00:15:07,690 --> 00:15:08,650
Good evening

354
00:15:08,650 --> 00:15:09,620
Hello?

355
00:15:09,620 --> 00:15:10,320
Good evening

356
00:15:10,890 --> 00:15:12,320
Hello

357
00:15:11,860 --> 00:15:13,960
Heh!

358
00:15:11,860 --> 00:15:13,960
Heh!

359
00:15:15,090 --> 00:15:18,100
You know the Ogata squad YouTube?

360
00:15:18,100 --> 00:15:22,830
I'd like you to do an impression for it

361
00:15:23,070 --> 00:15:24,840
I'm thinking of doing another event

362
00:15:24,840 --> 00:15:26,870
I'm working on a few things

363
00:15:26,870 --> 00:15:28,040
Ah, I see, yes

364
00:15:28,370 --> 00:15:34,150
After each of them has
started a realistic conversation...

365
00:15:34,350 --> 00:15:35,610
Can you wait a minute?

366
00:15:35,610 --> 00:15:36,610
Ah, sure. That's fine

367
00:15:36,610 --> 00:15:37,350
OK

368
00:15:37,480 --> 00:15:40,020
Ah, Nadal, hold on a second

369
00:15:38,680 --> 00:15:40,020
Sure

370
00:15:40,020 --> 00:15:40,580
One sec

371
00:15:40,580 --> 00:15:42,490
Hold on a moment. Sorry

372
00:15:41,590 --> 00:15:42,490
Sure, sure

373
00:15:46,220 --> 00:15:49,860
And then they put them on hold

374
00:15:50,160 --> 00:15:52,330
So, how long will he wait?

375
00:15:52,460 --> 00:15:53,900
I'm so excited

376
00:15:53,900 --> 00:15:58,900
Let the on-hold endurance race begin!

377
00:15:59,600 --> 00:16:03,110
Yikes, he looks like he'll hang up quickly

378
00:16:03,110 --> 00:16:07,550
Well, he'll wait 5 minutes won't he?

379
00:16:08,080 --> 00:16:10,680
He's still holding the phone

380
00:16:10,680 --> 00:16:15,550
He's swinging his legs. I think he's annoyed

381
00:16:16,150 --> 00:16:19,290
But it's still fine. We've passed 3 minutes

382
00:16:19,360 --> 00:16:24,060
All three groups get off to a good start

383
00:16:24,800 --> 00:16:28,170
I'm sorry. I'm starting to pity him

384
00:16:28,400 --> 00:16:30,740
This is long for Nadal, isn't it?

385
00:16:31,270 --> 00:16:33,870
He's done 6 minutes

386
00:16:35,540 --> 00:16:37,580
Huh, what?

387
00:16:37,580 --> 00:16:40,850
Ah, he hung up

388
00:16:40,850 --> 00:16:43,610
He suddenly hung up, he suddenly hung up

389
00:16:46,880 --> 00:16:53,660
And so the pair of Fujimon and Nadal are
eliminated after 6 minutes and 13 seconds

390
00:16:53,860 --> 00:16:57,330
Prank Reveal

391
00:16:59,530 --> 00:17:01,100
Wha...

392
00:17:01,100 --> 00:17:02,430
Wh- what is it?

393
00:17:02,630 --> 00:17:05,300
You hung up, didn't you?

394
00:17:05,300 --> 00:17:06,300
After 6 minutes

395
00:17:06,440 --> 00:17:07,970
6 minutes!

396
00:17:07,970 --> 00:17:09,610
I'm the one who should say that→

397
00:17:09,310 --> 00:17:10,570
6 minutes!

398
00:17:09,610 --> 00:17:10,570
with such energy

399
00:17:10,340 --> 00:17:12,340
(Nadal) Wait a minute

400
00:17:11,010 --> 00:17:12,680
You could only wait 6 minutes?

401
00:17:12,980 --> 00:17:14,910
I'm your senpai but if it were you...

402
00:17:13,340 --> 00:17:15,350
No, that's wrong

403
00:17:14,910 --> 00:17:16,250
That's wrong. Wait a minute

404
00:17:16,250 --> 00:17:18,750
6 minutes is a shock

405
00:17:17,350 --> 00:17:19,320
No, it was 8 minutes. I saw it

406
00:17:18,750 --> 00:17:19,320
6 minutes

407
00:17:19,420 --> 00:17:21,090
It was 8 minutes

408
00:17:21,220 --> 00:17:23,850
Evidence

409
00:17:21,350 --> 00:17:23,850
Please look, because it was 8 minutes

410
00:17:25,060 --> 00:17:25,890
Is that alright?

411
00:17:26,220 --> 00:17:28,760
I'm checking. It's fine, isn't it?

412
00:17:28,760 --> 00:17:30,630
Sorry... Maybe it was 6 minutes...

413
00:17:30,060 --> 00:17:32,700
It's 6 minutes

414
00:17:30,630 --> 00:17:32,700
It was 6 minutes. I'm sorry

415
00:17:33,030 --> 00:17:35,930
Let's check the remaining 2 groups

416
00:17:36,500 --> 00:17:38,200
We've passed 10 minutes

417
00:17:38,440 --> 00:17:39,970
10 minutes is done!

418
00:17:39,970 --> 00:17:42,410
10 minutes, we did it, we did it, we did it

419
00:17:42,610 --> 00:17:45,640
They clear the theory's 10 minutes without problems

420
00:17:45,880 --> 00:17:47,880
Hasn't he been like this from the start?

421
00:17:47,880 --> 00:17:52,450
So we'll continue the investigation and see how long they wait

422
00:17:53,150 --> 00:17:55,690
He's not looking at his phone. Only the magazine

423
00:17:55,890 --> 00:18:00,390
Kasuga waits with the call
on loudspeaker

424
00:18:00,520 --> 00:18:04,030
In contrast to this,Nedate
keeps his body in a phone call position

425
00:18:04,630 --> 00:18:08,130
Hold on, he's whistling. He's not angry at all

426
00:18:08,130 --> 00:18:11,270
He doesn't stress about waiting.

427
00:18:11,270 --> 00:18:13,240
Because he's whistling

428
00:18:15,340 --> 00:18:19,540
Ah is that it? The holding music

429
00:18:19,540 --> 00:18:22,080
Is he joining in with the hold music?

430
00:18:22,180 --> 00:18:25,180
But after 20 minutes have passed

431
00:18:25,180 --> 00:18:28,520
Nedate starts acting strangely

432
00:18:30,350 --> 00:18:31,590
Hello!

433
00:18:36,530 --> 00:18:38,400
Huh?

434
00:18:39,030 --> 00:18:43,800
After saying nothing for 20 minutes...

435
00:18:41,000 --> 00:18:43,800
a sudden "Hello"

436
00:18:44,200 --> 00:18:45,740
Hello!

437
00:18:46,370 --> 00:18:50,640
Ahh, this is scary. Doing hidden camera is scary

438
00:18:50,710 --> 00:18:52,710
And then...

439
00:18:53,340 --> 00:18:56,080
Bro, bro

440
00:18:56,410 --> 00:18:58,280
Huh, what?

441
00:18:59,150 --> 00:19:01,490
Bro, bro

442
00:19:01,490 --> 00:19:03,490
He's broken

443
00:19:03,490 --> 00:19:06,360
Bro, bro

444
00:19:06,590 --> 00:19:08,660
He's alone, isn't he?

445
00:19:08,790 --> 00:19:12,730
Bro, bro, bro

446
00:19:12,860 --> 00:19:15,800
Staff) What's going on?

447
00:19:13,860 --> 00:19:15,800
I don't know

448
00:19:16,000 --> 00:19:18,070
He's never even called me bro

449
00:19:18,170 --> 00:19:20,170
(Satō) He hasn't?

450
00:19:20,240 --> 00:19:23,810
What's taking you so long? Hey, Ihashi

451
00:19:24,580 --> 00:19:28,680
Ah, he's doing impressions

452
00:19:26,680 --> 00:19:28,680
Impressions...

453
00:19:28,680 --> 00:19:31,420
He's doing impressions, isn't he?

454
00:19:31,520 --> 00:19:38,890
It seems before Ogata put him on hold,
he was practicing impressions

455
00:19:39,360 --> 00:19:43,190
And he keeps going,
passing the one hour mark

456
00:19:43,590 --> 00:19:46,860
Idiot! Idiot!

457
00:19:48,070 --> 00:19:50,630
Idiot!

458
00:19:48,830 --> 00:19:50,630
Who is this?

459
00:19:51,200 --> 00:19:53,340
I'm sorry, sir

460
00:19:52,770 --> 00:19:54,770
Huh?

461
00:19:54,640 --> 00:19:56,670
I'm sorry, sir

462
00:19:54,770 --> 00:19:56,670
What?

463
00:19:56,870 --> 00:20:02,350
While he continues practicing
unidentifiable impressions...

464
00:20:02,380 --> 00:20:07,380
Kasuga stays focused on reading a single magazine

465
00:20:07,380 --> 00:20:10,890
At this point,
3 hours have passed since the start

466
00:20:10,890 --> 00:20:13,560
Seriously?

467
00:20:10,890 --> 00:20:13,560
That's amazing

468
00:20:13,560 --> 00:20:15,560
And then...

469
00:20:14,630 --> 00:20:17,130
I have a question

470
00:20:17,490 --> 00:20:21,470
Am I able to give up?

471
00:20:21,800 --> 00:20:26,800
I've got work quite early tomorrow

472
00:20:27,240 --> 00:20:31,180
Due to a work commitment, Haraguchi gives up

473
00:20:31,240 --> 00:20:34,910
They finish after
3 hours and 4 minutes

474
00:20:31,710 --> 00:20:35,050
Haraguchi and Kasuga eliminated

475
00:20:35,350 --> 00:20:36,850
That was so long

476
00:20:36,850 --> 00:20:39,480
No, no. What? What is it?

477
00:20:39,480 --> 00:20:42,350
So long

478
00:20:40,480 --> 00:20:42,350
What's long?

479
00:20:43,090 --> 00:20:46,160
3 hours is long

480
00:20:43,920 --> 00:20:45,920
No...

481
00:20:46,490 --> 00:20:48,230
Why didn't you hang up?

482
00:20:48,390 --> 00:20:51,960
Because you said "hold on a moment"

483
00:20:51,960 --> 00:20:53,500
So I waited

484
00:20:53,930 --> 00:21:00,670
And so the only one remaining is a man
who probably isn't aware of the handsfree function

485
00:21:00,940 --> 00:21:03,340
But Ogata has a problem too

486
00:21:04,940 --> 00:21:08,580
So today I got up at 5am

487
00:21:08,980 --> 00:21:11,420
And first thing tomorrow I'm shooting in Sendai

488
00:21:11,520 --> 00:21:14,050
So is it okay if I take a small nap?

489
00:21:14,050 --> 00:21:16,890
If I don't sleep tomorrow's going to be impossible

490
00:21:16,890 --> 00:21:20,420
Staff) You won't give up?

491
00:21:17,620 --> 00:21:20,420
I won't. Because
he's doing his best for us

492
00:21:20,420 --> 00:21:26,200
So he has a nap with his phone still on hold

493
00:21:27,400 --> 00:21:33,500
And then after that he does 2 hours of
impressions, holding his phone throughout

494
00:21:33,500 --> 00:21:37,370
The weirdo Nedate

495
00:21:37,410 --> 00:21:39,410
Well he is a freak with this isn't he?

496
00:21:39,410 --> 00:21:42,410
Then, after 5 hours of being on hold

497
00:21:42,410 --> 00:21:44,520
finally...

498
00:21:45,450 --> 00:21:48,020
Ogata-san, I'm sorry. Goodbye

499
00:21:51,090 --> 00:21:56,290
Nedate suddenly hangs up and
starts preparing to go home

500
00:21:57,960 --> 00:22:00,600
Staff) He hung up, he hung up

501
00:22:00,700 --> 00:22:05,540
Woken up by the staff,
Ogata rushes to confront him

502
00:22:05,540 --> 00:22:07,540
And then...

503
00:22:10,510 --> 00:22:12,740
What's wrong with you?

504
00:22:12,740 --> 00:22:14,280
What's going on?

505
00:22:14,280 --> 00:22:16,680
It's not about what I'm doing

506
00:22:15,950 --> 00:22:16,680
Huh?

507
00:22:17,250 --> 00:22:19,050
It's 3:10am you know

508
00:22:19,120 --> 00:22:22,120
Staff) Why didn't you hang up the phone?

509
00:22:22,120 --> 00:22:24,860
I was waiting and creating impressions

510
00:22:25,960 --> 00:22:28,230
I wrote all these impressions

511
00:22:28,230 --> 00:22:31,160
There's so much here. Woah

512
00:22:31,230 --> 00:22:32,700
Were you really watching me?

513
00:22:32,700 --> 00:22:35,100
Only the first half. I was asleep for the second

514
00:22:35,100 --> 00:22:37,800
Sleeping?Are you crazy?

515
00:22:37,900 --> 00:22:43,070
And so, the Ogata squad should not be underestimated

516
00:22:38,000 --> 00:22:43,070
Ogata & Nedate





Haraguchi & Kasuga




Fujimoto & Nadal

517
00:22:38,000 --> 00:22:43,070
On-hold challenge

518
00:22:43,070 --> 00:22:46,080
Yes, that's all from us

519
00:22:46,440 --> 00:22:49,180
Beating Kasuga-san

520
00:22:47,410 --> 00:22:50,910
Nedate went on for five hours

521
00:22:47,410 --> 00:22:50,910
Right?

522
00:22:50,910 --> 00:22:52,920
But Kasuga-san's 3
hours was long too

523
00:22:52,920 --> 00:22:54,920
But if Haraguchi hadn't given up there

524
00:22:54,920 --> 00:22:56,920
Yes, that's true

525
00:22:54,920 --> 00:22:56,920
he'd do it forever

526
00:22:56,920 --> 00:22:58,920
Yes.
Because I was told to wait

527
00:22:58,920 --> 00:23:00,860
What goes through your mind?

528
00:23:00,860 --> 00:23:03,960
Well, it's as I said...

529
00:23:02,390 --> 00:23:04,260
I'm told to wait so I wait

530
00:23:04,360 --> 00:23:08,470
Do you get a thrill out of waiting?

531
00:23:09,030 --> 00:23:11,030
Do you ****?

532
00:23:11,540 --> 00:23:15,210
"I'm waiting!"

533
00:23:11,540 --> 00:23:15,210
Yes more ecstatic the longer it goes on

534
00:23:15,210 --> 00:23:18,210
I'm not thinking "I feel so
good!" while I'm waiting

535
00:23:32,920 --> 00:23:39,430
Everyone's Theories as chosen by
Chocolate Planet

536
00:23:37,210 --> 00:23:39,220
Next it's...

537
00:23:39,430 --> 00:23:47,600
Theory: If you win a contest, people you don't remember at all
will contact you, Part 2

538
00:23:47,720 --> 00:23:54,240
We previously investigated this with
the champions of 2016's King of Conte, Rice

539
00:23:54,240 --> 00:23:56,850
I've got someone I don't know

540
00:23:56,850 --> 00:23:59,320
So have I

541
00:23:59,400 --> 00:24:03,690
How about this year's winners, Kūki Kaidan?

542
00:24:03,950 --> 00:24:08,260
We strike right after the live broadcast finishes

543
00:24:08,280 --> 00:24:10,310
Staff) Have you checked your phones yet?

544
00:24:10,310 --> 00:24:13,350
Staff) Since winning

545
00:24:11,760 --> 00:24:13,330
Ah, I haven't

546
00:24:12,260 --> 00:24:13,330
I haven't

547
00:24:13,350 --> 00:24:16,000
So, can we look now?

548
00:24:14,400 --> 00:24:16,000
Staff) Yes, you can

549
00:24:16,020 --> 00:24:18,720
Umm...

550
00:24:17,220 --> 00:24:19,090
141 messages

551
00:24:20,020 --> 00:24:22,030
(Suzuki) On LINE, yes

552
00:24:22,960 --> 00:24:24,660
97 messages

553
00:24:25,560 --> 00:24:31,770
Some are from friends from my hometown

554
00:24:32,040 --> 00:24:36,510
There's also news about an event at the Pachinko shop

555
00:24:36,510 --> 00:24:43,010
There's 3 of those so the real number's 138, not 141

556
00:24:43,180 --> 00:24:46,380
Staff) How about from people you don't remember?

557
00:24:46,380 --> 00:24:48,490
People I don't remember...

558
00:24:48,490 --> 00:24:51,490
People I don't remember... Wait a moment

559
00:24:53,320 --> 00:24:56,110
I remember them all

560
00:24:56,110 --> 00:25:01,980
I also remember all of mine

561
00:25:01,140 --> 00:25:01,980
Sorry

562
00:25:02,000 --> 00:25:05,940
Staff) No, it's totally fine

563
00:25:02,580 --> 00:25:05,920
Sorry...

564
00:25:03,500 --> 00:25:06,200
This...

565
00:25:03,500 --> 00:25:06,200
Yes

566
00:25:05,940 --> 00:25:10,670
You've come to check if people we don't remember have contacted us after winning, haven't you?

567
00:25:09,150 --> 00:25:10,650
Staff) Yes

568
00:25:15,910 --> 00:25:19,630
Staff) But there's not anything wrong with that

569
00:25:17,290 --> 00:25:19,630
Sorry. Really...

570
00:25:19,650 --> 00:25:24,070
I didn't think we'd disappoint people so soon after winning

571
00:25:24,070 --> 00:25:30,070
Everyone's Theories
as chosen by Chocolate Planet

572
00:25:27,860 --> 00:25:29,960
Next, it's...

573
00:25:30,070 --> 00:25:37,550
Theory: Harvesting the bontan fruit is also called bontan hunting

574
00:25:30,070 --> 00:25:46,620
TL note: As well as being a fruit 'bontan' is a word used
for puffy pants, associated with 1980s high school delinquents.

Bontan hunting is the practice of hunting down those wearing
them and robbing them of them; mainly associated with high school manga.

Also, hunting and harvesting are the same word in Japanese

575
00:25:37,550 --> 00:25:44,390
So we checked the sightseeing website
of somewhere known for producing bontans,

576
00:25:37,850 --> 00:25:44,390
Kagoshima-ken's Akune city

577
00:25:45,360 --> 00:25:57,370
Bontan hunting / processing experience

578
00:25:45,360 --> 00:25:57,370
The "Bontan" is a large fruit that was sent 230 years ago as a
thank you for helping a Chinese ship that had
washed ashore off the coast of Akune.

Have fun harvesting the famous Akune Bontan.
You will also be able to try your hand at processing.

579
00:25:45,880 --> 00:25:47,980
And found it

580
00:25:48,390 --> 00:25:57,370
Bontan hunting experience

581
00:25:51,720 --> 00:25:55,390
If this isn't about
the fruit,

582
00:25:55,390 --> 00:25:57,390
it'd look something like this

583
00:25:57,370 --> 00:26:01,370
Bontan hunting experience

584
00:26:01,370 --> 00:26:05,760
And you can also experience processing here

585
00:26:01,370 --> 00:26:06,310
Bontan hunting / processing experience

586
00:26:01,370 --> 00:26:06,310
The "Bontan" is a large fruit that was sent 230 years ago as a

Have fun harvesting the famous Akune Bontan.
You will also be able to try your hand at processing.

587
00:26:01,710 --> 00:26:06,310
Bontan processing experience

588
00:26:06,830 --> 00:26:10,330
Ah, really?

589
00:26:06,830 --> 00:26:10,330
No, no, no

590
00:26:10,330 --> 00:26:14,050
And then we checked a local newspaper too...

591
00:26:15,010 --> 00:26:18,510
An article titled
"bontan hunting in full swing"

592
00:26:18,510 --> 00:26:21,180
And so...

593
00:26:18,860 --> 00:26:24,800
Bontan hunting in full swing

594
00:26:18,860 --> 00:26:24,800
TBS Announcer
Yoshihara Ami

595
00:26:21,180 --> 00:26:24,180
We had an announcer read it out in a news report-style for us

596
00:26:24,800 --> 00:26:29,520
On the 11th, the Ozaki district of Akune City, which is known for its production of bontans,

597
00:26:29,520 --> 00:26:35,860
held its 8th annual Ozaki Iki Iki Festival under the auspices of the district's Village Development Committee.

598
00:26:35,860 --> 00:26:39,530
Parents and children enjoyed bonton hunting.

599
00:26:39,530 --> 00:26:42,200
In the bontan garden next to the community center,

600
00:26:42,200 --> 00:26:48,370
children harvested large bontans with the help of local residents.

601
00:26:48,370 --> 00:26:50,420
Pork soup and onigiri were served

602
00:26:50,420 --> 00:26:53,210
and agricultural and
fishery products were on sale.

603
00:26:53,210 --> 00:26:55,930
The village of bontans was
bustling with activity.

Everyone's Theories

605
00:26:59,550 --> 00:27:01,950
Next it's...

606
00:27:01,970 --> 00:27:10,310
Theory: If you're sleeping somewhere extremely noisy, if it becomes quiet, you'll wake up instanty

607
00:27:10,490 --> 00:27:12,700
And so...

608
00:27:15,830 --> 00:27:17,530
Woah, it's cold

609
00:27:18,500 --> 00:27:20,270
Huh, where is this?

610
00:27:20,320 --> 00:27:25,840
Akatsu has already been
awake for 20 hours

611
00:27:25,840 --> 00:27:29,850
We're going to have him
sleep at this construction site

612
00:27:30,810 --> 00:27:33,380
I'm going to sleep outside in a place like this?

613
00:27:33,850 --> 00:27:37,500
All we tell Akatsu is that he has to go to sleep

614
00:27:37,650 --> 00:27:41,190
I won't be able to sleep like this

615
00:27:41,190 --> 00:27:43,390
Let the investigation begin

616
00:27:43,790 --> 00:27:45,400
Staff) Please begin

617
00:27:46,780 --> 00:27:48,710
Goodnight

618
00:27:56,910 --> 00:27:58,440
Shut up

619
00:27:58,440 --> 00:28:00,710
Just shut up!

620
00:28:00,840 --> 00:28:03,510
It's noisy and there's vibrations too

621
00:28:03,510 --> 00:28:05,980
It's so close

622
00:28:05,960 --> 00:28:08,390
But 30 minutes later...

623
00:28:14,220 --> 00:28:17,710
Akatsu is in
a deep sleep

624
00:28:17,710 --> 00:28:21,180
Head of Sleep EEG Laboratory
Wada Chihiro-san

625
00:28:18,460 --> 00:28:21,200
Wow, he's asleep!

626
00:28:21,300 --> 00:28:24,230
We've confirmed he's asleep by checking his brainwaves

627
00:28:24,230 --> 00:28:28,690
so will leave it like this for a while

628
00:28:28,990 --> 00:28:33,390
1 hour later

629
00:28:30,310 --> 00:28:33,310
It's almost time to stop the noise

630
00:28:33,590 --> 00:28:41,130
If he wakes up within 10 seconds of the noise stopping, the theory is considered proven

631
00:28:41,750 --> 00:28:43,950
Let's see what happens

632
00:28:58,080 --> 00:29:04,090
Everyone's Theories
as chosen by Chocopla

633
00:29:01,870 --> 00:29:03,870
Finally, it's...

634
00:29:04,090 --> 00:29:11,460
If a young comedian starts talking exactly like Nobu,
his senpai will warn him

635
00:29:11,550 --> 00:29:16,690
We'll have some young comedians come to the office for a review of their material

636
00:29:16,930 --> 00:29:19,600
No one's going to come see us like this

637
00:29:19,720 --> 00:29:22,070
You can't just say he's red

638
00:29:22,310 --> 00:29:29,550
Investigation details:

A young comedian will rip off Nobu's tsukkomi style,
and we'll see if the senpai comedian instructing him will warn him

639
00:29:29,550 --> 00:29:34,400
Helping us with this is someone whose accent
is similar to Nobu's Okayama-ben,

640
00:29:29,880 --> 00:29:37,420
Boke
Murasato

641
00:29:29,880 --> 00:29:37,420
Mamaland (est. 6 years ago)

642
00:29:29,880 --> 00:29:37,420
Tsukkomi
Kame (from Hiroshima)

643
00:29:34,400 --> 00:29:37,410
this young comedian
from Hiroshima.

644
00:29:37,410 --> 00:29:42,090
And the senpai we'll be targeting is...

645
00:29:42,750 --> 00:29:45,050
Good morning.
Nice to meet you

646
00:29:45,730 --> 00:29:48,470
Kimura Yūichi

647
00:29:48,590 --> 00:29:50,790
He'll say it

648
00:29:49,970 --> 00:29:52,100
Kimu will say it

649
00:29:52,100 --> 00:29:59,030
Kimura usually works at NSC (Yoshimoto New Star Creation) and is known for being a harsh critic

650
00:29:59,580 --> 00:30:01,950
Will he say anything?

651
00:30:01,950 --> 00:30:04,200
Yes, hello

652
00:30:04,200 --> 00:30:07,270
We're Mamaland. Nice to meet you

653
00:30:07,270 --> 00:30:09,870
So yesterday I was about to
sleep and got into bed

654
00:30:09,870 --> 00:30:12,210
I glanced at the ceiling
and saw something

655
00:30:12,210 --> 00:30:15,550
Rustling, sticky-looking
and gleaming black

656
00:30:15,550 --> 00:30:18,250
No, no!

657
00:30:15,550 --> 00:30:18,250
Oh.. a bodybuilder

658
00:30:18,430 --> 00:30:21,900
Why would there be a bodybuilder rustling around in my ceiling?

659
00:30:22,050 --> 00:30:26,390
(Kame) No, it was a cockroach! Don't they
say if you've got one there's a hundred?

660
00:30:26,390 --> 00:30:29,390
In that case I know how to get rid of it

661
00:30:26,390 --> 00:30:29,390
Seriously? Tell me

662
00:30:29,390 --> 00:30:32,730
A spider will eat it for you

663
00:30:29,390 --> 00:30:32,730
A spider?

664
00:30:32,730 --> 00:30:35,400
An iPad?!

665
00:30:32,730 --> 00:30:35,400
One as big as an iPad...

666
00:30:35,400 --> 00:30:38,230
That's huge isn't it?

667
00:30:35,400 --> 00:30:38,230
Yep, and covered in thick hair

668
00:30:38,230 --> 00:30:40,300
Dripping

669
00:30:38,230 --> 00:30:40,300
Hey, that's scary

670
00:30:40,300 --> 00:30:43,240
That's the Wet iPad Tarantula!

671
00:30:43,240 --> 00:30:46,580
(Kame) It's the most dangerous one

672
00:30:43,240 --> 00:30:46,580
(Murasato) Just leave it in the room for 10 minutes

673
00:30:46,580 --> 00:30:49,080
(Kame) Just forget it.
I'm fine with the cockroach

674
00:30:49,080 --> 00:30:52,580
It rustles in the ceiling doesn't it?

675
00:30:49,080 --> 00:30:52,580
What do you do with the spider?

676
00:30:53,000 --> 00:30:54,830
Hey, get back on topic

677
00:30:54,830 --> 00:30:57,750
(Kame) I'll have just swapped a cockroach for a tarantula

678
00:30:57,750 --> 00:31:00,200
He's thinking about how
much he's imitating him

679
00:30:59,820 --> 00:31:04,190
As he's subjected to successive hits of Nobu-style tsukkomi,

680
00:31:05,200 --> 00:31:08,200
Kimu has a suspicious expression

681
00:31:08,200 --> 00:31:10,700
And then...

682
00:31:10,700 --> 00:31:13,370
Hey that's long

683
00:31:10,700 --> 00:31:13,370
Yep and about as thick as me

684
00:31:13,370 --> 00:31:16,040
And it's known for its pattern

685
00:31:13,370 --> 00:31:16,040
It's huge

686
00:31:16,040 --> 00:31:18,440
Pattern?

687
00:31:16,040 --> 00:31:18,440
Yep, its whole body is paisley

688
00:31:18,560 --> 00:31:20,820
No, a snake's too individualistic

689
00:31:20,820 --> 00:31:25,300
No, a snake's too individualistic

690
00:31:23,110 --> 00:31:25,380
(Kame) Isn't that the Paisley Snake?

691
00:31:25,380 --> 00:31:30,220
After some tsukommi that seems like
it was somehow left out of a Chidori performance...

692
00:31:30,220 --> 00:31:32,220
We're done.
Thank you very much

693
00:31:32,220 --> 00:31:34,220
They finish their performance here

694
00:31:34,220 --> 00:31:37,970
Will he warn them as expected, or not?

695
00:31:40,760 --> 00:31:42,730
You like Nobu, don't you?

696
00:31:43,750 --> 00:31:47,170
Would I say I like him? I suppose

697
00:31:47,170 --> 00:31:51,020
We're from the same area so...

698
00:31:48,180 --> 00:31:51,020
Ah, really? It felt like Hiroshima-ben

699
00:31:51,040 --> 00:31:53,440
I think I might seem a bit like him

700
00:31:53,440 --> 00:31:56,180
Hmmm

701
00:31:56,180 --> 00:31:59,650
But what about doing tsukommi with your fist clenched?

702
00:31:58,310 --> 00:32:00,620
(Kame) Ah, yes

703
00:31:59,800 --> 00:32:01,600
Well.. . like...

704
00:32:02,620 --> 00:32:07,240
Nobu does that too, right?

705
00:32:04,770 --> 00:32:07,240
Yes, I suppose so

706
00:32:07,240 --> 00:32:09,990
Staff) So you're saying he's a bit like him?

707
00:32:09,990 --> 00:32:15,200
I looked at where he was from and was like "Ah Hiroshima". I have friends who are like that

708
00:32:15,200 --> 00:32:17,230
'That's just how it is' I thought

709
00:32:17,230 --> 00:32:18,550
Many people are like that

710
00:32:18,570 --> 00:32:21,070
Like how people say 'what the hell' in Osaka-ben

711
00:32:21,070 --> 00:32:25,660
If you've always spoken like that then there's no helping it

712
00:32:23,220 --> 00:32:25,660
Yes, this is how I usually speak

713
00:32:25,710 --> 00:32:31,710
Surprisingly it appears he wasn't that
bothered about him speaking like Nobu

714
00:32:31,830 --> 00:32:33,920
However...

715
00:32:36,090 --> 00:32:38,020
How is it being called "Mamaland"?

716
00:32:38,020 --> 00:32:40,990
There's a "Laland" already. Doesn't it bother you?

717
00:32:41,260 --> 00:32:44,260
Um, it does. There's Mamatarte-san too

718
00:32:44,260 --> 00:32:47,930
I think it's good to have some flexibility

719
00:32:48,040 --> 00:32:52,550
He's very sensitive to their being named similarly to other groups

720
00:32:52,570 --> 00:32:55,240
Yes, that was our last one

721
00:32:55,240 --> 00:32:57,240
Matsumoto-san
how was the last one?

722
00:32:57,240 --> 00:33:00,540
As we expected,
Kimu...

723
00:33:00,760 --> 00:33:04,460
wanted to throw a plastic bottle, just how Kinoshita does it

724
00:33:04,410 --> 00:33:06,620
He's not like that

725
00:33:04,410 --> 00:33:06,620
He's not that scary

726
00:33:08,180 --> 00:33:11,190
He wanted to hit him in the eye with it

727
00:33:08,180 --> 00:33:11,190
No no...

728
00:33:11,190 --> 00:33:14,260
He wouldn't go that far

729
00:33:11,190 --> 00:33:14,260
So he's mellowed out

730
00:33:14,260 --> 00:33:16,860
He instructed us too
when we were at NSC

731
00:33:16,860 --> 00:33:19,930
Oh, really?

732
00:33:16,860 --> 00:33:19,930
We were able to meet him then

733
00:33:19,930 --> 00:33:22,700
Right?

734
00:33:19,930 --> 00:33:22,700
and he was fairly scary then

735
00:33:22,700 --> 00:33:25,700
He's been very kind
since we graduated though

736
00:33:25,700 --> 00:33:29,370
Karen-chan, what did you think?

737
00:33:25,700 --> 00:33:29,370
One really made an impression with me

738
00:33:29,370 --> 00:33:32,210
the Bontan one

739
00:33:31,050 --> 00:33:35,490
Theory: Harvesting the bontan fruit is also called bontan hunting

740
00:33:32,210 --> 00:33:35,040
I really loved it

741
00:33:35,040 --> 00:33:38,380
There's so many words like
that in Japanese, aren't there?

742
00:33:38,380 --> 00:33:41,050
So I'd love for you to keep doing it

743
00:33:41,050 --> 00:33:45,890
And explaining something complicated
with pictures was really helpful

744
00:33:45,890 --> 00:33:51,270
By the way, do you know the reason
why the students are pulling the bontans off?

745
00:33:49,390 --> 00:33:51,730
Ah, umm...

746
00:33:51,270 --> 00:33:52,240
I don't know

747
00:33:51,730 --> 00:33:54,400
You didn't know!

748
00:33:54,400 --> 00:33:56,900
But you laughed so much

749
00:33:55,880 --> 00:33:58,010
You didn't know but were able to enjoy it

750
00:33:58,230 --> 00:34:00,400
She really enjoyed it

751
00:34:00,400 --> 00:34:03,810
Next it's...

752
00:34:00,480 --> 00:34:05,960
Everyone's Theories
as chosen by Kasuga

753
00:34:05,960 --> 00:34:08,410
Yes, here are Everyone's Theories
that I chose

754
00:34:08,490 --> 00:34:20,240
Theory: If you ask someone who definitely looks over 80
how old they are and they reply 'I'm 60', you'll still answer 'you don't look it!'

755
00:34:20,690 --> 00:34:24,190
I see

756
00:34:20,690 --> 00:34:24,190
That's right

757
00:34:24,540 --> 00:34:27,840
You can't say 'you look old'

758
00:34:26,030 --> 00:34:28,030
Well, that's right

759
00:34:26,030 --> 00:34:28,030
Yes

760
00:34:28,030 --> 00:34:33,450
So we investigated if they'll still say the usual phrase 'you don't look it'

761
00:34:35,190 --> 00:34:49,430
Theory: If you ask someone who definitely looks over 80
how old they are and they reply 'I'm 60', you'll still answer 'you don't look it!'

762
00:34:49,710 --> 00:34:51,710
And so...

763
00:34:51,710 --> 00:34:54,380
Thank you! Hello!

764
00:34:54,380 --> 00:34:56,880
It's Panther's Ogata! Hello

765
00:34:55,340 --> 00:34:57,720
He's in the same clothes

766
00:34:56,940 --> 00:35:03,280
We've made a fake show where he interviews older people on the street to discover their health secrets

767
00:35:03,280 --> 00:35:10,590
We send in this 89-year old grandpa
who couldn't possibly be 60

768
00:35:11,730 --> 00:35:13,730
Let's see what happens

769
00:35:14,600 --> 00:35:16,830
How old are you now?

770
00:35:16,830 --> 00:35:18,070
I'm sixty

771
00:35:18,060 --> 00:35:20,430
Si... Sixty?

772
00:35:19,060 --> 00:35:20,430
Yes

773
00:35:20,440 --> 00:35:24,140
Ah... but... you're young, aren't you?

774
00:35:25,510 --> 00:35:28,010
Taken by surprise,
all Ogata can say is...

775
00:35:28,300 --> 00:35:31,010
'you're young, aren't you?'

776
00:35:31,010 --> 00:35:36,510
Then Ogata worries what he'll look like in his 50s if this man is 60

777
00:35:36,850 --> 00:35:39,050
You're 60?

778
00:35:37,750 --> 00:35:39,050
Yes, I am

779
00:35:39,360 --> 00:35:41,420
Seriously?

780
00:35:40,350 --> 00:35:41,420
Yes

781
00:35:41,420 --> 00:35:44,830
So do you ever get told you look older than you are?

782
00:35:44,830 --> 00:35:45,800
I'm told that

783
00:35:45,800 --> 00:35:47,730
You are, aren't you?

784
00:35:47,730 --> 00:35:50,970
Is this on purpose...

785
00:35:50,970 --> 00:35:57,010
That's a sweater someone who's over 60 would wear, isn't it?

786
00:35:53,530 --> 00:35:55,230
Do you think?

787
00:35:57,010 --> 00:35:59,740
Is it not on purpose?

788
00:35:57,770 --> 00:35:59,740
It's nothing like that

789
00:36:00,080 --> 00:36:01,110
Huh?

790
00:36:01,480 --> 00:36:04,850
If you're 60 then...

791
00:36:02,560 --> 00:36:04,560
He's still going!

792
00:36:04,850 --> 00:36:07,420
Taka-san, Ishibashi Takaaki-san...

793
00:36:07,720 --> 00:36:10,920
I was born in 1961

794
00:36:10,920 --> 00:36:13,420
So compared to me...

795
00:36:13,420 --> 00:36:17,360
You're 16 years my senior

796
00:36:17,360 --> 00:36:21,100
Ah, 16 years... Ah, I see

797
00:36:21,100 --> 00:36:24,260
Huh, so that means you're the same age as Tunnels-san?

798
00:36:23,290 --> 00:36:24,260
That's right

799
00:36:26,570 --> 00:36:28,670
Wow

800
00:36:30,010 --> 00:36:32,340
Well I guess comedians are young

801
00:36:32,410 --> 00:36:37,470
So he did not say "you don't look it"

802
00:36:37,480 --> 00:36:39,480
He was so persistent

803
00:36:39,480 --> 00:36:43,490
Yes, Ogata-kun didn't say it

804
00:36:43,490 --> 00:36:47,420
I thought it'd be fine since 'you don't look it' can mean something else

805
00:36:47,420 --> 00:36:50,430
But he just said 'you're young'

806
00:36:47,420 --> 00:36:50,430
Well, that's right

807
00:36:50,430 --> 00:36:53,430
Yes, because he clearly wasn't 60

808
00:36:53,430 --> 00:36:56,270
Satō-san, what about
if it were you?

809
00:36:56,270 --> 00:36:58,930
I'd probably say 'you look adult-like'

810
00:36:56,270 --> 00:36:59,600
'Adult-like'

811
00:36:59,600 --> 00:37:01,600
'Adult-like', is it?

812
00:37:01,600 --> 00:37:03,910
Like 'you seem like an adult'

813
00:37:04,170 --> 00:37:07,900
I don't think that's how it works

814
00:37:05,780 --> 00:37:09,080
(Osada) That'd make
sense if it were a teen

815
00:37:10,210 --> 00:37:13,550
So there still more
Everyone's Theories that I've chosen

816
00:37:13,550 --> 00:37:16,750
Here's the rest!

817
00:37:16,910 --> 00:37:22,920
Everyone's Theories
as chosen by Kasuga

818
00:37:20,890 --> 00:37:22,890
Next is...

819
00:37:22,920 --> 00:37:26,690
Inffective megaphone theory

820
00:37:26,730 --> 00:37:34,160
The megaphone's known for distorting your voice
and making it harder for people to understand you

821
00:37:34,400 --> 00:37:40,640
So for this, we'll have someone known for having a loud voice, Oideyasu Oda, use his real voice

822
00:37:40,740 --> 00:37:46,440
And someone known for being quiet, Harusenbon's Haruka, will use a megaphone

823
00:37:46,440 --> 00:37:49,910
They'll face the judge, Koga Ken→

824
00:37:49,910 --> 00:37:55,850
and we'll investigate which can be heard from farther away

825
00:37:55,850 --> 00:37:58,090
The words they'll be shouting

826
00:37:58,090 --> 00:38:00,260
will be decided by lottery

827
00:38:00,260 --> 00:38:02,630
Shine muscat

828
00:38:00,260 --> 00:38:03,700
(Oda) Shine muscat

829
00:38:03,700 --> 00:38:05,770
Gasoline stand

830
00:38:04,230 --> 00:38:05,830
Gasoline stand
('gas station')

831
00:38:05,770 --> 00:38:08,370
Starting with a distance of...

832
00:38:08,370 --> 00:38:11,970
First is Oideyasu Oda
with his own voice

833
00:38:14,210 --> 00:38:16,280
Shine

834
00:38:16,280 --> 00:38:18,710
muscat!

835
00:38:18,710 --> 00:38:20,780
Shine

836
00:38:20,780 --> 00:38:22,790
muscat!

837
00:38:28,120 --> 00:38:30,330
I've got it

838
00:38:30,330 --> 00:38:33,230
'Shine muscat'

839
00:38:33,460 --> 00:38:35,700
It was very clear

840
00:38:35,800 --> 00:38:40,300
Next is Harusenbon's Haruka
with a megaphone

841
00:38:43,570 --> 00:38:46,280
Gasoline stand

842
00:38:47,240 --> 00:38:50,050
Gasoline stand

843
00:38:51,240 --> 00:38:54,280
Huh...?

844
00:38:54,550 --> 00:38:57,320
I heard 'goshuin stamp'

845
00:38:57,310 --> 00:39:03,320
Everyone's Theories
as chosen by Kasuga

846
00:39:01,190 --> 00:39:03,190
Next is...

847
00:39:03,320 --> 00:39:12,960
Theory: that fried snack is called 'churros' 50% of the time, 'churritos' 30% of the time, and 'churro' 20% of the time

848
00:39:13,230 --> 00:39:23,380
We investigated the 143 shops that we were able to confirm sell this snack on restaurant review app Tabelog

849
00:39:20,070 --> 00:39:28,180
Breakdown of what the fried snack is called

850
00:39:20,070 --> 00:39:28,180
Churros



Churritos



Churro

851
00:39:23,370 --> 00:39:28,180
Note: Chain restaurants count as one shop

852
00:39:23,380 --> 00:39:27,380
First, the most familiar name, 'churros'

853
00:39:28,450 --> 00:39:30,450
With places like Disneyland,

854
00:39:30,450 --> 00:39:34,060
and restaurants specializing in 'churros'

855
00:39:34,060 --> 00:39:40,060
98 shops use it with a percentage of 68.5%

856
00:39:34,180 --> 00:39:42,390
Breakdown of what the fried snack is called

857
00:39:34,180 --> 00:39:42,390
Churros



Churritos



Churro

858
00:39:34,180 --> 00:39:42,390
Note: Chain restaurants count as one shop

859
00:39:40,060 --> 00:39:42,390
Next, 'churritos'

860
00:39:42,790 --> 00:39:46,200
TOHO Cinemas

861
00:39:44,060 --> 00:39:46,200
Churritos

862
00:39:44,070 --> 00:39:46,070
Places like
movie theaters...

863
00:39:46,070 --> 00:39:49,070
and zoos often use it

864
00:39:46,200 --> 00:39:49,140
Tobu Zoo

865
00:39:49,130 --> 00:39:54,300
Breakdown of what the fried snack is called

866
00:39:49,130 --> 00:39:54,300
Churros



Churritos



Churro

867
00:39:49,130 --> 00:39:54,300
Note: Chain restaurants count as one shop

868
00:39:52,070 --> 00:39:54,300
And finally it's 'churro'

869
00:39:54,300 --> 00:39:57,140
TL note: It's a blurred photo of Mister Donut

870
00:39:54,340 --> 00:39:59,710
It's used at 4 shops including that well-known chain

871
00:39:57,140 --> 00:40:00,780
Breakdown of what the fried snack is called

872
00:39:57,140 --> 00:40:00,780
Churros



Churritos



Churro

873
00:39:57,140 --> 00:40:00,780
Note: Chain restaurants count as one shop

874
00:40:01,020 --> 00:40:04,020
And so the final results are as shown

875
00:40:01,380 --> 00:40:13,690
Churros

876
00:40:01,680 --> 00:40:13,690
Churritos

877
00:40:01,780 --> 00:40:13,690
Churro

878
00:40:04,020 --> 00:40:13,820
By the way, it wasn't on Tabelog, but the three large convenience store chains use the word 'Churrokkii'

879
00:40:13,820 --> 00:40:19,560
Churritos

880
00:40:13,820 --> 00:40:19,560
Churro

881
00:40:13,820 --> 00:40:19,560
Churrokkii

882
00:40:13,820 --> 00:40:19,560
Churros

883
00:40:13,860 --> 00:40:19,530
But why do so many different names exist for it in the first place?

884
00:40:19,560 --> 00:40:24,970
We asked this shop which sells churritos

885
00:40:22,170 --> 00:40:25,400
Kinoshita Eiji-san

886
00:40:25,410 --> 00:40:27,910
It's originally from Spain and Portugal

887
00:40:27,910 --> 00:40:30,950
and it's fried snack called a 'churro'

888
00:40:30,950 --> 00:40:32,420
And then over here,

889
00:40:32,420 --> 00:40:36,120
splitting it into pieces and dipping it in chocolate sauce→

890
00:40:36,120 --> 00:40:37,850
is how we generally eat it

891
00:40:37,850 --> 00:40:40,760
so from that the plural 's' got attached

892
00:40:40,760 --> 00:40:43,360
'Churros' started from that

893
00:40:43,590 --> 00:40:46,630
Originally in Japan the registered trademark

894
00:40:46,630 --> 00:40:49,670
was probably by Nissin Foods, I think

895
00:40:49,470 --> 00:40:52,900
so because the word 'churros'
was already a registered trademark,

896
00:40:49,890 --> 00:41:01,300
Churros

897
00:40:49,890 --> 00:41:01,300
Nissin Foods registered trademark

898
00:40:52,900 --> 00:40:56,570
…no one could name it
that anymore

899
00:40:56,570 --> 00:41:01,340
And that's how the word 'churritos'
started being used in Japan

900
00:40:57,170 --> 00:41:01,300
Zeal House registered trademark

901
00:40:57,170 --> 00:41:01,300
Churritos

902
00:41:01,300 --> 00:41:08,180
Churros



Churritos

903
00:41:01,300 --> 00:41:08,180
Nissin Foods registered trademark



Zeal House  registered trademark

904
00:41:01,340 --> 00:41:06,180
And then to avoid these, the word churrokkii was invented

905
00:41:01,500 --> 00:41:11,580
Churros



Churritos




Churrokkii

906
00:41:01,500 --> 00:41:11,580
Nissin Foods registered trademark



Zeal House  registered trademark




Yamazaki Baking registered trademark

907
00:41:06,180 --> 00:41:11,250
Yes, it's a snack that's been pushed around a lot
due to a grown-up sitatuation

908
00:41:11,580 --> 00:41:17,590
Everyone's Theories
as chosen by Kasuga

909
00:41:15,190 --> 00:41:17,490
Next it's...

910
00:41:17,590 --> 00:41:30,000
↑
(Russian ex-boxer, a.k.a. Yuri Arbachakov)

911
00:41:17,590 --> 00:41:30,000
(area famous for boxing)
↓

912
00:41:17,590 --> 00:41:30,000
Theory: When asking people around Kōrakuen who owns the instagram account "yuri_ebhihara", half will say Ebihara Yuri and half will say Yūri Ebihara

913
00:41:17,590 --> 00:41:30,000
↑
(model)

914
00:41:30,000 --> 00:41:37,840
So we started asking people who came
to see that day's boxing match

915
00:41:31,530 --> 00:41:33,800
Kourakuen Hall

916

918
00:41:37,880 --> 00:41:40,380
By the way, this account

919
00:41:40,380 --> 00:41:42,450
in reality of course

920
00:41:41,110 --> 00:41:46,080

belongs to the model Ebihara Yuri, a.ka. Ebi-chan

924
00:41:46,090 --> 00:41:49,430
Staff) We're asking about this Instagram username

925
00:41:49,430 --> 00:41:51,360
Staff) Who do you think it belongs to?

926
00:41:51,350 --> 00:42:26,960
Ebihara Yuri

927
00:41:51,350 --> 00:42:26,960
Yūri Ebihara

928
00:41:51,360 --> 00:41:53,530
Ummm.. Ebi-chan

929
00:41:53,520 --> 00:41:58,360
The ex-model from CanCan or AneCan

930
00:41:58,370 --> 00:41:59,640
Ebi-chan

931
00:42:00,340 --> 00:42:01,670
Ebi-chan

932
00:42:01,670 --> 00:42:03,410
The model Ebi-chan

933
00:42:03,410 --> 00:42:05,110
Ebihara Yuri-san

934
00:42:05,270 --> 00:42:07,940
The celebrity Ebi-chan. She was cute

935
00:42:08,040 --> 00:42:12,380
It's Yūri Ebihara, right? The former boxer

936
00:42:12,820 --> 00:42:16,550
But that can't be. He wouldn't be on there

937
00:42:16,850 --> 00:42:19,160
And then after that too...

938
00:42:19,360 --> 00:42:22,020
Yūri Ebihara, from the Soviet Union

939
00:42:22,020 --> 00:42:24,560
Isn't it the boxer Yūri Ebihara-san?

940
00:42:24,790 --> 00:42:26,960
Yūri the boxer

941
00:42:27,020 --> 00:42:29,990
Just as expected at the holy land of boxing, Kourakuen

942
00:42:30,030 --> 00:42:35,130
there were a fairly high number
of people answering Yūri

943
00:42:35,160 --> 00:42:42,170
Ebihara Yuri

944
00:42:35,160 --> 00:42:42,170
Yūri Ebihara

945
00:42:35,170 --> 00:42:38,040
Yūri Ebihara, right?

946
00:42:38,040 --> 00:42:40,010
The model Ebihara Yuri-san

947
00:42:40,480 --> 00:42:42,180
Yuriyan Retriever

948
00:42:42,340 --> 00:42:54,050
Ebihara Yuri

949
00:42:42,550 --> 00:42:45,610
Our results from asking 77 people:

950
00:42:42,840 --> 00:42:54,050
Don't know

951
00:42:43,010 --> 00:42:54,050
Yūri Ebihara

952
00:42:43,170 --> 00:42:54,050
Other

953
00:42:45,610 --> 00:42:47,880
37 people said Ebi-chan,

954
00:42:47,880 --> 00:42:51,220
and 17 people answered Yūri.

955
00:42:51,220 --> 00:42:53,920
And there was someone else too...

956
00:42:51,240 --> 00:42:53,350
So?

957
00:42:54,060 --> 00:42:56,890
Staff) This is a certain person's Instagram account

958
00:42:56,890 --> 00:43:00,100
Staff) Do you know who owns it?

959
00:42:58,120 --> 00:43:00,090
Yes, it's my son's

960
00:43:00,100 --> 00:43:01,830
Staff) Your son's?

961
00:43:00,890 --> 00:43:01,820
Yes

962
00:43:01,830 --> 00:43:03,130
Staff) Who is that?

963
00:43:03,130 --> 00:43:04,900
He's called Kanaya Yūri

964
00:43:05,470 --> 00:43:07,670
He's got a match today at Kourakuen Hall

965
00:43:07,660 --> 00:43:19,780
Kanaya Yūri

966
00:43:07,840 --> 00:43:12,040
When the boxer Yūri Arbachakov debuted in Japan,

967
00:43:12,040 --> 00:43:14,610
he debuted with the name Yūri Ebihara, you know

968
00:43:14,610 --> 00:43:17,910
So the Yūri from Yūri Ebihara

969
00:43:17,910 --> 00:43:19,750
is how my son got his name

970
00:43:19,780 --> 00:43:25,780
Everyone's Theories
as chosen by Kasuga

971
00:43:23,420 --> 00:43:25,420
And finally...

972
00:43:25,780 --> 00:43:42,160
Theory: You do the kind of survey where people on the street give their opinion by putting a sticker on a board and ask people which musician they'd rather hug. If the board already has 99 stickers on it that voted for Hotei Tomoyasu and 0 for Fukuyama Masaharu, it's possible someone will go with the flow and vote for Hotei

973
00:43:42,230 --> 00:43:43,900
This is really evil

974
00:43:56,880 --> 00:44:01,850
Theory: You do the kind of survey where people on the street give their opinion by putting a sticker on a board and ask people which musician they'd rather hug. If the board already has 99 stickers on it that voted for Hotei Tomoyasu and 0 for Fukuyama Masaharu, it's possible someone will go with the flow and vote for Hotei

975
00:44:01,850 --> 00:44:08,720
Fukuyama Masaharu

976
00:44:01,850 --> 00:44:08,720
Hotei Tomoyasu

977
00:44:01,850 --> 00:44:08,720
Which musician would you rather hug?

978
00:44:02,180 --> 00:44:05,190
Huh? There's no one

979
00:44:05,920 --> 00:44:08,720
No way... I'll go with this

980
00:44:10,790 --> 00:44:14,060
It'll be bad if I don't vote for this one

981
00:44:17,000 --> 00:44:20,340
Huh? This shouldn't be

982
00:44:20,800 --> 00:44:28,040
So, while people are doubting the vote totals, as expected the only one getting votes is Fukuyama

983
00:44:28,510 --> 00:44:31,010
But then...

984
00:44:34,520 --> 00:44:38,090
We got one

985
00:44:35,280 --> 00:44:37,550
(Staff) Hotei-san?

986
00:44:35,280 --> 00:44:37,550
Yes

987
00:44:38,450 --> 00:44:42,290
Staff) So do you like Hotei-san?

988
00:44:39,390 --> 00:44:42,290
Of course, yes, I like Hotei-san

989
00:44:42,290 --> 00:44:48,130
Staff) And Fukuyama-san?

990
00:44:43,460 --> 00:44:48,130
I like Fukuyama-san too, of course. He's wonderful

991
00:44:48,630 --> 00:44:51,030
Staff) But why did you not vote for him?

992
00:44:51,030 --> 00:44:55,340
No, it's just... well...

993
00:44:55,340 --> 00:44:59,940
Well... everyone voted this side

994
00:45:01,640 --> 00:45:03,880
Like...

995
00:45:03,910 --> 00:45:08,520
I didn't have the courage to put the sticker here

996
00:45:08,520 --> 00:45:14,160
So the result is that some people
are easy to influence

997
00:45:14,990 --> 00:45:18,490
That last one was so evil

998
00:45:14,990 --> 00:45:18,490
Yes

999
00:45:18,490 --> 00:45:21,160
Hotei theories
are a favorite of ours

1000
00:45:21,160 --> 00:45:23,630
And, also. This show...

1001
00:45:24,130 --> 00:45:27,270
Have we finally been stopped from using Disneyland photos?

1002
00:45:26,800 --> 00:45:29,670
It was

1003
00:45:26,800 --> 00:45:29,670
It was a drawing, wasn't it?

1004
00:45:29,670 --> 00:45:31,970
So...

1005
00:45:29,670 --> 00:45:31,970
Well, it happens

1006
00:45:32,070 --> 00:45:35,750
We've even been banned from the land of dreams now?

1007
00:45:36,110 --> 00:45:38,410
Is that how you see it?

1008
00:45:38,410 --> 00:45:42,820
If only Yūri Ebihara's photo was the one we couldn't use

1009
00:45:42,820 --> 00:46:14,820

Next week, if a female celebrity you haven't seen for a long time has had loads of plastic surgery,

1011
00:45:44,050 --> 00:45:46,290
Anzai Hiroko

1012
00:45:44,050 --> 00:45:46,290
Nīyama Chiharu

1013
00:45:48,300 --> 00:45:50,270
it's hard to say anything

1014
00:45:50,270 --> 00:45:52,780
<Thank you

1015
00:45:50,270 --> 00:45:52,780
Looking forward to working with you

1016
00:45:52,780 --> 00:45:56,480
Nice to meet you

1017
00:45:52,780 --> 00:45:56,480
You haven't changed at all

1018
00:45:56,480 --> 00:45:58,810
<Yes, nice
to meet you

1019
00:45:58,810 --> 00:46:01,150
Then, unsuccessful comedians face off

1020
00:46:01,150 --> 00:46:04,910
We find out who's the best at taking bentos from backstage home

1021
00:46:07,820 --> 00:46:09,790
That's enough. That's enough.
