1
00:00:07,080 --> 00:00:08,420
Let's get started

2
00:00:08,420 --> 00:00:11,910
Please welcome our first guest

3
00:00:15,400 --> 00:00:18,710
It's Viking's Kotouge!

4
00:00:20,130 --> 00:00:21,280
It's the real thing!

5
00:00:21,850 --> 00:00:22,630
The real one

6
00:00:22,740 --> 00:00:27,970
This time, I'm bringing you a yearly project

7
00:00:28,940 --> 00:00:32,250
The 2022 Prank Ranking

8
00:00:32,250 --> 00:00:34,540
That's great

9
00:00:34,540 --> 00:00:35,650
It's that time of year again

10
00:00:35,650 --> 00:00:37,620
Every year

11
00:00:37,620 --> 00:00:40,390
The first one was you
-Yes

12
00:00:40,390 --> 00:00:44,140
I did both 2014 and 2015

13
00:00:44,540 --> 00:00:46,770
This is the ninth time this year

14
00:00:47,260 --> 00:00:49,930
Have you ever been allowed to prank anyone?

15
00:00:49,930 --> 00:00:53,620
I've done my share of screwing people over

16
00:00:54,020 --> 00:00:55,600
There was a time during one prank

17
00:00:55,600 --> 00:00:59,600
That I was the one pranking, but also being pranked

18
00:01:00,940 --> 00:01:02,280
There is also this process

19
00:01:02,280 --> 00:01:06,280
The feeling of being flipped when wrestling to make a four-figure leg lock
-A reversal

20
00:01:06,280 --> 00:01:07,880
Yes, when I realized it I thought

21
00:01:07,880 --> 00:01:11,050
You're the one who always gets screwed, so why are you screwing someone else?

22
00:01:11,050 --> 00:01:11,800
Yeah

23
00:01:27,940 --> 00:01:32,420
2022 Prank Ranking

24
00:01:33,420 --> 00:01:35,280
First up, number 10

25
00:01:36,370 --> 00:01:39,620
Gerardon's Attack Nishimoto with 7 times

26
00:01:39,620 --> 00:01:40,280
That's a nice name

27
00:01:41,020 --> 00:01:44,620
Next up are two with 8 times

28
00:01:45,740 --> 00:01:48,620
Diane's Tsuda and Panther's Ogata

29
00:01:48,850 --> 00:01:50,620
I thought there'd be more

30
00:01:49,650 --> 00:01:51,480
Number 7 is

31
00:01:52,850 --> 00:01:56,080
Nelsons Wada Bunch with 9 times

32
00:01:55,370 --> 00:01:56,560
I do see him all the time

33
00:01:56,800 --> 00:01:59,020
Next up is number 6

34
00:02:00,140 --> 00:02:01,940
Joy with 10 times

35
00:02:01,310 --> 00:02:02,800
Eh, why?

36
00:02:02,800 --> 00:02:05,280
Since the beginning of the survey in 2014

37
00:02:05,280 --> 00:02:09,220
He has appeared more than anyone else

38
00:02:09,910 --> 00:02:11,140
Always in the top ten

39
00:02:10,680 --> 00:02:14,050
The next three are tied

40
00:02:15,420 --> 00:02:19,110
Yasuko, Nishkikoi's Hasegawa

41
00:02:19,110 --> 00:02:22,140
And Oda

42
00:02:23,680 --> 00:02:26,480
As the 2021 King of being pranked

43
00:02:26,820 --> 00:02:29,370
He has failed to win a 2nd time in a row

44
00:02:30,820 --> 00:02:32,970
Next up in 2nd place was

45
00:02:34,420 --> 00:02:37,540
Nadal

46
00:02:36,200 --> 00:02:38,650
It's true. I always see Nadal

47
00:02:39,080 --> 00:02:44,250
He was at the top of the list in 2020 too

48
00:02:44,250 --> 00:02:46,450
This time he's 2nd

49
00:02:47,540 --> 00:02:48,570
What are you filming?

50
00:02:49,510 --> 00:02:53,310
And then, in first place

51
00:02:55,020 --> 00:02:58,310
The Mommy's Sakai with 21 times

52
00:02:58,310 --> 00:02:59,420
Wow

53
00:02:59,140 --> 00:03:01,370
A gap of 5 times with 2nd place

54
00:03:01,370 --> 00:03:06,220
Sakai is 2022's King of Being Pranked

55
00:03:06,220 --> 00:03:10,070
That's the result

56
00:03:10,070 --> 00:03:12,850
In this group of funny people

57
00:03:12,850 --> 00:03:16,240
What's the deal with Joy?
-It's impressive

58
00:03:16,240 --> 00:03:18,340
What kind of pranks?

59
00:03:18,340 --> 00:03:19,940
Don't remember

60
00:03:19,940 --> 00:03:22,880
It's really awesome to be on the list with these guys

61
00:03:22,880 --> 00:03:25,620
And he's been on the list 5 times so far

62
00:03:25,620 --> 00:03:28,140
Yes, and at the top of the list

63
00:03:29,000 --> 00:03:31,320
Did you just say "joy" as in "top"?

64
00:03:29,000 --> 00:03:31,320
※Joy is synonymous with the word "top"

65
00:03:32,050 --> 00:03:34,570
Hamada, you'll get penalized for that

66
00:03:35,850 --> 00:03:38,360
Used the word "Joy" when saying "top"

67
00:03:39,140 --> 00:03:41,850
There are so many words that can be used instead

68
00:03:43,370 --> 00:03:46,370
So, one day in January

69
00:03:47,540 --> 00:03:50,800
We reported the results to Sakai

70
00:03:51,650 --> 00:03:52,840
Morning

71
00:03:53,110 --> 00:03:58,020
For the year 2022, you are the person that has been pranked the most

72
00:03:58,020 --> 00:04:00,790
Eh?

73
00:04:00,790 --> 00:04:02,520
Really?

74
00:04:02,520 --> 00:04:04,160
Have I been pranked so many times?

75
00:04:04,800 --> 00:04:05,910
Something's wrong with this guy

76
00:04:04,820 --> 00:04:08,390
But it's true, now that I think about it

77
00:04:08,390 --> 00:04:13,670
I used to read scripts for hours without realizing they were just for a setup

78
00:04:14,370 --> 00:04:16,770
So, as usual

79
00:04:16,770 --> 00:04:20,110
Sakai will go through 7 pranks in one week

80
00:04:20,110 --> 00:04:21,820
Will he notice?

81
00:04:21,820 --> 00:04:24,280
A whole week of pranks

82
00:04:24,510 --> 00:04:27,080
That means this year's "Prank King" is Sakai

83
00:04:27,080 --> 00:04:30,520
Oh, is that so? Thank you

84
00:04:30,520 --> 00:04:33,590
Well, saying thank you seems kind of lame

85
00:04:33,590 --> 00:04:35,400
It would be a lie to say I'm looking forward to it

86
00:04:35,400 --> 00:04:37,690
You should be able to find them all, right?

87
00:04:37,690 --> 00:04:40,460
Because I get screwed over a lot

88
00:04:40,460 --> 00:04:43,600
I think my sensors are still working just fine

89
00:04:44,170 --> 00:04:46,970
We've got a few tricks up our sleeve for Sakai

90
00:04:47,770 --> 00:04:51,450
It's January and the cicadas are chirping in Kagoshima

91
00:04:52,250 --> 00:04:56,620
There's a shock on the doorknob that's not on the same order of magnitude as static electricity

92
00:04:56,420 --> 00:04:57,540
You can tell, can't you?

93
00:04:57,540 --> 00:05:02,080
The star of the moment's home is super small

94
00:05:01,400 --> 00:05:03,510
Who knows?

95
00:05:02,650 --> 00:05:06,910
The background of the Zoom conference looks synthesized, but it's actually a real view

96
00:05:06,680 --> 00:05:08,250
That's interesting

97
00:05:07,680 --> 00:05:11,220
The interviewer laughs his ass off no matter what is said

98
00:05:11,970 --> 00:05:16,510
The number of words in the narrator's lines is clearly too many to say in the time available

99
00:05:15,740 --> 00:05:17,480
But it does happen once in a while

100
00:05:17,400 --> 00:05:22,100
The color of an old man's nipples in a hot spring is not something people can obtain

101
00:05:22,110 --> 00:05:25,600
Not something people can obtain?

102
00:05:26,200 --> 00:05:29,280
The camera will follow Sakai for a week

103
00:05:29,280 --> 00:05:32,910
Throughout which he's subjected to the seven tricks

104
00:05:33,400 --> 00:05:36,770
1 week later he will be asked to identify what happened to him

105
00:05:36,770 --> 00:05:39,880
And state what was a prank

106
00:05:40,400 --> 00:05:44,420
Will Sakai be able to get it all right?

107
00:05:51,130 --> 00:05:52,430
Thank you for your hard work

108
00:05:52,430 --> 00:05:53,970
Thank you

109
00:05:54,370 --> 00:05:56,470
It's been a long week

110
00:05:56,470 --> 00:05:58,970
I don't even feel alive anymore

111
00:05:58,970 --> 00:06:03,940
Strange things have happened

112
00:06:03,940 --> 00:06:06,950
There's been a sense of constant tension

113
00:06:06,950 --> 00:06:09,150
So I think I've noticed a lot

114
00:06:09,150 --> 00:06:10,510
You've guessed...

115
00:06:10,510 --> 00:06:13,390
It should be fine

116
00:06:13,820 --> 00:06:18,020
The first thing that Sakai considered to be a prank is

117
00:06:18,490 --> 00:06:21,390
In an interview with a magazine

118
00:06:21,390 --> 00:06:27,730
There was an older man who laughed at everything I said

119
00:06:27,730 --> 00:06:33,740
An overreacting older man

120
00:06:33,740 --> 00:06:35,070
Was it a fake laugh?

121
00:06:33,850 --> 00:06:35,710
That's right

122
00:06:35,370 --> 00:06:39,110
No matter what I said, he laughed, even if it wasn't funny

123
00:06:39,110 --> 00:06:41,580
The best reception i've ever had

124
00:06:41,750 --> 00:06:44,580
I think that guy is suspicious

125
00:06:43,650 --> 00:06:45,620
Don't make it sound like a disaster

126
00:06:44,780 --> 00:06:47,250
You've been popular lately

127
00:06:47,250 --> 00:06:48,590
I've been busy

128
00:06:48,590 --> 00:06:50,360
You've been gambling, have you?

129
00:06:50,360 --> 00:06:51,920
On racing

130
00:06:51,920 --> 00:06:53,760
Ah, racing

131
00:06:54,140 --> 00:06:56,590
Doing the math, it's about five million dollars

132
00:06:56,590 --> 00:06:57,880
5 million?

133
00:06:57,880 --> 00:06:59,130
You made 5 million?

134
00:06:59,130 --> 00:06:59,600
I lost 5 million dollars

135
00:06:59,880 --> 00:07:02,280
Lossed, ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha

136
00:07:00,600 --> 00:07:04,500
No matter what The interviewer laughs his ass off

137
00:07:03,250 --> 00:07:05,220
It'd make you angry

138
00:07:04,500 --> 00:07:07,070
Right-handed steel ball, left-handed rowboat
-Ah ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha!

139
00:07:07,070 --> 00:07:08,480
That's awesome

140
00:07:08,650 --> 00:07:11,110
Laughing super hard

141
00:07:11,010 --> 00:07:13,850
I didn't say anything that funny either...

142
00:07:14,150 --> 00:07:18,200
The guy's laughing so hard he's banging on the table

143
00:07:18,420 --> 00:07:20,190
After circling Yoshimoto

144
00:07:20,190 --> 00:07:21,750
I see

145
00:07:23,450 --> 00:07:25,020
Now its come full circle

146
00:07:25,200 --> 00:07:27,170
It's so exaggerated

147
00:07:28,620 --> 00:07:32,570
We talked about H, the comedian

148
00:07:39,140 --> 00:07:40,740
Scared

149
00:07:40,640 --> 00:07:43,370
You're gonna break the table again.
-I'm sorry

150
00:07:43,370 --> 00:07:45,310
It's not that funny

151
00:07:45,450 --> 00:07:49,150
He ended up hitting it with a wet towel or something

152
00:07:49,150 --> 00:07:50,920
I spilled my coffee

153
00:07:50,920 --> 00:07:53,320
Sometimes you can't go because of covid

154
00:07:53,320 --> 00:07:54,590
Fingernails are all curled up

155
00:07:57,460 --> 00:08:00,260
I'm sorry. I'm sorry. Are you okay?

156
00:08:00,830 --> 00:08:04,060
I was wearing jeans

157
00:08:04,060 --> 00:08:07,900
Got coffee on my new sneakers

158
00:08:08,070 --> 00:08:10,240
My brand-new sneakers

159
00:08:10,800 --> 00:08:12,970
I'm sorry

160
00:08:12,880 --> 00:08:16,340
Wow, that's super hot

161
00:08:15,070 --> 00:08:16,740
Are you okay with what you're drinking?

162
00:08:17,050 --> 00:08:20,410
If this isn't a trick

163
00:08:20,410 --> 00:08:23,750
I really can't forgive this guy

164
00:08:23,750 --> 00:08:26,950
So I'm hoping this is a trick

165
00:08:27,570 --> 00:08:31,280
So, Sakai got one right

166
00:08:32,250 --> 00:08:34,770
Ahahahahahahahahahahahaha

167
00:08:38,570 --> 00:08:40,620
Spilled coffee doesn't help

168
00:08:40,930 --> 00:08:42,470
So annoying

169
00:08:42,620 --> 00:08:44,970
I'm sure I would guess this was a trick

170
00:08:45,050 --> 00:08:49,710
Sakai Thinks It Was a Trick
2

171
00:08:49,810 --> 00:08:52,140
I'm confident in this too

172
00:08:52,140 --> 00:08:55,710
There was a job to remake a sitcom from the past

173
00:08:55,710 --> 00:09:04,760
My character was a marriage scammer at a shrimp farm

174
00:09:04,760 --> 00:09:07,630
And was the star of that remake

175
00:09:07,630 --> 00:09:10,360
How is that possible?

176
00:09:10,650 --> 00:09:12,910
You think it's impossible?
-Absolutely impossible

177
00:09:13,110 --> 00:09:14,250
I'm sure it's impossible

178
00:09:14,300 --> 00:09:19,740
So many impossible things happened on the set

179
00:09:20,000 --> 00:09:28,250
The cameraman was wearing the exact same clothes as someone else

180
00:09:28,250 --> 00:09:32,880
The dresser gave me a different set of shoes

181
00:09:33,080 --> 00:09:36,420
They weren't the same. They were from different manufacturers

182
00:09:38,390 --> 00:09:40,730
I was thinking "this whole thing is a scam"

183
00:09:40,730 --> 00:09:42,760
The whole thing is a prank

184
00:09:43,200 --> 00:09:46,280
Sakai is referring to this sitcom remake

185
00:09:46,280 --> 00:09:52,050
It's been on TBS World's Finest Mysteries for a while now

186
00:09:52,270 --> 00:09:55,240
All the shrimp that were raised died...

187
00:09:55,770 --> 00:10:00,050
So, it's no longer possible that he'll get everything right

188
00:09:58,280 --> 00:09:59,510
So fast

189
00:10:00,410 --> 00:10:05,080
Sakai Thinks It Was a Trick
3

190
00:10:05,380 --> 00:10:08,120
The first time i've visited the neighborhood ramen store

191
00:10:08,120 --> 00:10:10,590
I just moved in a little while ago

192
00:10:10,820 --> 00:10:13,120
There was a guy was was supposedly the store manager

193
00:10:13,120 --> 00:10:16,160
Super busy with all sorts of stuff

194
00:10:16,730 --> 00:10:19,300
I said a bowl of ramen with soy sauce

195
00:10:19,300 --> 00:10:22,500
He said, "Wait a minute. I'll come back later"

196
00:10:22,830 --> 00:10:26,270
But then I looked around and realized I was the only customer

197
00:10:28,600 --> 00:10:30,050
Furthermore

198
00:10:30,110 --> 00:10:33,940
At 6:00 a.m., my intercom rang

199
00:10:33,940 --> 00:10:35,350
The guy downstairs in my house told me

200
00:10:35,350 --> 00:10:42,050
You had a fight with a woman yesterday, didn't you? A big one

201
00:10:42,050 --> 00:10:47,060
But I wasn't even at home that night

202
00:10:47,450 --> 00:10:51,700
And the next morning at 6:00 a.m., he rang again

203
00:10:51,700 --> 00:10:55,400
You brought a girl home again, didn't you? You had a fight

204
00:10:56,480 --> 00:10:58,680
I think it was a prank

205
00:10:59,710 --> 00:11:01,620
This is a horror story, isn't it?

206
00:11:01,870 --> 00:11:05,050
I always take my clothes to the coin laundry

207
00:11:05,050 --> 00:11:06,810
Because I don't have a washing machine

208
00:11:07,110 --> 00:11:10,310
I turned on the washing machine in the laundry room

209
00:11:10,310 --> 00:11:13,020
And found some unrecognizable old man's clothes in there

210
00:11:13,940 --> 00:11:15,650
It's disgusting, isn't it?

211
00:11:15,650 --> 00:11:18,370
Not right at all

212
00:11:18,480 --> 00:11:21,290
What kind of life does this guy have?

213
00:11:21,730 --> 00:11:25,630
My new apartment

214
00:11:25,650 --> 00:11:28,930
There was a pile of human shit under the mailbox

215
00:11:30,570 --> 00:11:33,340
How does he know it was human?

216
00:11:30,800 --> 00:11:35,740
Sakai has had so many amazing events in his neighborhood

217
00:11:35,740 --> 00:11:37,940
5 consecutive wrong answers

218
00:11:35,770 --> 00:11:37,880
That's amazing. A great life

219
00:11:38,410 --> 00:11:44,580
Sakai Thinks It Was a Trick
3

220
00:11:38,910 --> 00:11:41,110
Sakai, who only got one question right

221
00:11:41,110 --> 00:11:43,600
Reveals the last trick

222
00:11:47,320 --> 00:11:52,190
Someone said they wanted me to do a promotion for Tochigi Prefecture

223
00:11:52,190 --> 00:11:55,860
Let me record the narration for the animation

224
00:11:56,030 --> 00:11:57,360
Have you ever worked as a narrator?

225
00:11:57,360 --> 00:12:00,700
Yeah, I've been called in as a narrator for the regular program

226
00:12:00,700 --> 00:12:02,630
Your voice has great texture

227
00:12:02,630 --> 00:12:04,480
I'm so glad you said that. Thank you

228
00:12:04,470 --> 00:12:08,910
They told me to finish my lines before the scene changes

229
00:12:08,910 --> 00:12:15,080
The lines that start in the middle of the scene can't be finished until the scene changes

230
00:12:15,480 --> 00:12:23,090
Then read 01:07, 01:13.
-Okay

231
00:12:24,080 --> 00:12:29,340
I'd like to recommend two places in Tochigi that you mustn't miss

232
00:12:29,740 --> 00:12:34,880
First up, the three apes who are known for not looking, not talking, not listening

233
00:12:35,270 --> 00:12:37,600
Okay. Thank you

234
00:12:37,740 --> 00:12:41,270
So let's go to 01:19.
-Okay

235
00:12:42,280 --> 00:12:47,570
First up, the three apes who are known for not looking, not talking, not listening

236
00:12:48,280 --> 00:12:50,340
The famous three apes

237
00:12:50,340 --> 00:12:53,200
It's a warning not to listen

238
00:12:53,200 --> 00:12:55,800
Don't look at this!

239
00:12:55,800 --> 00:12:59,020
Don't speak unless spoken to

240
00:12:59,020 --> 00:13:02,130
Keep a straight mind...

241
00:13:02,280 --> 00:13:04,280
I'm sorry please pause for a moment

242
00:13:04,280 --> 00:13:05,740
Its a little slow

243
00:13:05,970 --> 00:13:11,070
Thee most important part of the description was the middle

244
00:13:11,070 --> 00:13:13,640
But he made me read it super fast

245
00:13:13,970 --> 00:13:16,110
We can't finish this narration without reading it

246
00:13:16,110 --> 00:13:17,640
Oh, yeah

247
00:13:17,880 --> 00:13:20,600
I'm sorry. Read it again, please

248
00:13:20,600 --> 00:13:21,980
Ok

249
00:13:22,310 --> 00:13:27,540
First up, the three apes who are known for not looking, not talking, not listening

250
00:13:28,080 --> 00:13:29,740
The famous three apes

251
00:13:29,740 --> 00:13:32,020
It's a warning not to listen

252
00:13:32,020 --> 00:13:34,200
Don't look

253
00:13:34,200 --> 00:13:36,770
Don't speak unless spoken to

254
00:13:36,770 --> 00:13:39,600
Keep a straight mind...

255
00:13:39,600 --> 00:13:41,670
I'm sorry

256
00:13:41,850 --> 00:13:42,870
Out of time

257
00:13:42,870 --> 00:13:44,370
I'm sorry. It's a shame about this one

258
00:13:44,370 --> 00:13:45,500
So close

259
00:13:45,500 --> 00:13:46,200
Sorry, please try again

260
00:13:46,200 --> 00:13:48,340
I'm sorry

261
00:13:49,220 --> 00:13:54,450
First up, the three apes who are known for not looking, not talking, not listening

262
00:13:55,080 --> 00:13:56,650
The famous three apes

263
00:13:56,650 --> 00:13:58,710
It's a warning not to listen

264
00:13:58,710 --> 00:14:00,420
Don't look

265
00:14:00,420 --> 00:14:02,540
Don't speak unless spoken to

266
00:14:02,540 --> 00:14:06,250
Keep a straight mind...

267
00:14:06,620 --> 00:14:08,510
He did it

268
00:14:09,130 --> 00:14:10,090
How was it?

269
00:14:10,090 --> 00:14:12,300
Thank you
-Is that all right?

270
00:14:13,370 --> 00:14:19,700
I read really fast

271
00:14:19,700 --> 00:14:23,310
But the other guy said it was OK

272
00:14:23,510 --> 00:14:27,650
So let's go to 01:30.
-Okay

273
00:14:31,480 --> 00:14:32,880
That was fast

274
00:14:35,770 --> 00:14:39,690
The second one is a sleeping cat. Sorry

275
00:14:39,690 --> 00:14:41,260
That was fast... sorry!

276
00:14:41,260 --> 00:14:43,030
Sorry I just feel like I'm reading too fast

277
00:14:43,760 --> 00:14:46,000
Because your own voice feeds back

278
00:14:46,000 --> 00:14:49,540
I laughed out loud when I heard myself read it so fast

279
00:14:49,540 --> 00:14:54,970
哒哒哒一顿输出然后接下来是睡着的猫

280
00:14:56,140 --> 00:14:58,600
That's the dish in the picture

281
00:14:59,450 --> 00:15:00,510
That's a long line

282
00:15:00,510 --> 00:15:04,570
Bean curd is a soy product, when you make soy milk

283
00:15:04,570 --> 00:15:08,940
The film formed on the surface of soymilk when cooking is fished out and dried to form

284
00:15:08,940 --> 00:15:10,680
Unlike the flatness of the Kyoto variation

285
00:15:10,680 --> 00:15:12,590
It has existed since the Edo period

286
00:15:13,290 --> 00:15:13,690
Sorry

287
00:15:13,690 --> 00:15:16,030
This line has to be said before the interview

288
00:15:16,130 --> 00:15:19,730
I don't think the instructions for the thing are necessary

289
00:15:20,110 --> 00:15:23,080
Bean curd is a soy product, when you make soy milk

290
00:15:20,210 --> 00:15:21,010
Know all about bean curd

291
00:15:23,080 --> 00:15:26,540
The film formed on the surface of soymilk when cooking is fished out and dried to form

292
00:15:26,540 --> 00:15:29,200
Unlike the flatness of the Kyoto variation

293
00:15:29,200 --> 00:15:30,570
The tofus is rolled

294
00:15:30,570 --> 00:15:32,380
It has existed since the Edo period

295
00:15:32,940 --> 00:15:33,800
This one's gone again

296
00:15:33,800 --> 00:15:35,750
Auntie's bean curd

297
00:15:35,680 --> 00:15:36,970
So annoying

298
00:15:35,910 --> 00:15:39,250
The guy at the store said to be sure to add this note

299
00:15:39,250 --> 00:15:41,400
I see. There's no way to cut it down, is there?

300
00:15:41,400 --> 00:15:44,420
Yeah, I'm sorry.
-It's okay. I'm trying. I'm sorry

301
00:15:44,650 --> 00:15:47,050
Bean curd is a soy product, when you make soy milk

302
00:15:47,050 --> 00:15:49,740
The film formed on the surface of soy milk when cooking is fished out and dried to form

303
00:15:49,740 --> 00:15:51,650
Unlike the flatness of the Kyoto variation

304
00:15:51,650 --> 00:15:53,400
This type is rolled into many layers

305
00:15:53,400 --> 00:15:55,680
And is haracterized by roundness and fullness

306
00:15:55,680 --> 00:15:57,500
It has existed since the Edo period

307
00:15:58,020 --> 00:15:59,900
Thank you. Thank you very much.
-Is that all right?

308
00:15:59,910 --> 00:16:03,440
That's a big help.
-Thanks.

309
00:16:03,080 --> 00:16:04,770
He did it

310
00:16:04,740 --> 00:16:08,380
Because the staff is very conscientious

311
00:16:08,380 --> 00:16:12,080
I don't think I've ever done this kind of animation before

312
00:16:12,080 --> 00:16:14,420
But, how to put it...

313
00:16:14,420 --> 00:16:18,890
I wouldn't have been called in to record this, would I?

314
00:16:19,370 --> 00:16:22,820
So the result is as follows

315
00:16:21,510 --> 00:16:23,110
Only two of them were right

316
00:16:23,890 --> 00:16:26,000
You got two correct

317
00:16:26,000 --> 00:16:27,230
Two?

318
00:16:27,400 --> 00:16:29,930
So little. Only two

319
00:16:29,930 --> 00:16:31,240
Only two?

320
00:16:31,470 --> 00:16:34,240
No way! No way! I don't want it to be true

321
00:16:34,570 --> 00:16:40,280
Which one do you have the most confidence in?

322
00:16:40,280 --> 00:16:42,080
Magazine interviews

323
00:16:42,310 --> 00:16:44,250
That's right.
-That's great

324
00:16:44,250 --> 00:16:47,920
That's what I'm talking about. That's suspicious

325
00:16:48,250 --> 00:16:50,420
Eh, what else is there?

326
00:16:50,550 --> 00:16:53,320
The one who complained that I'm noisy is a pain in the ass

327
00:16:53,340 --> 00:16:55,360
The guy who complained about me was horrible

328
00:16:55,360 --> 00:16:56,310
That we don't know

329
00:16:56,310 --> 00:16:57,570
Don't know?

330
00:16:56,760 --> 00:17:01,930
Neighbor Complaints

331
00:16:59,000 --> 00:17:01,930
Is that true? Do I have to move?

332
00:17:01,620 --> 00:17:03,420
I hate it when people like that live downstairs

333
00:17:01,930 --> 00:17:04,070
You also guessed correctly about the narration

334
00:17:04,070 --> 00:17:06,940
Ah, the narration

335
00:17:07,470 --> 00:17:09,240
Indeed

336
00:17:10,810 --> 00:17:12,440
It was really exaggerated at the end

337
00:17:13,450 --> 00:17:16,540
This presentation is really just the tip of the iceberg

338
00:17:16,540 --> 00:17:19,970
There are many other places in Nikko that I hope you will visit

339
00:17:20,570 --> 00:17:23,110
One of the three most famous waterfalls in Japan

340
00:17:23,110 --> 00:17:25,940
The 97-meter-high Huayan Falls

341
00:17:25,940 --> 00:17:28,600
A stunning driving route with 48 curves

342
00:17:28,600 --> 00:17:32,620
Iroha-zaka and other sightseeing routes connecting downtown Nikko with Lake Chuzenji and Oku Nikko

343
00:17:34,530 --> 00:17:35,390
There's more?

344
00:17:37,100 --> 00:17:37,790
So long

345
00:17:37,790 --> 00:17:39,170
Awesome

346
00:17:39,170 --> 00:17:43,280
Nakamiya Shrine of Nikko Futarayama Shrine in the center of Futarayama Honsha in Nikko City

347
00:17:43,280 --> 00:17:45,400
You can visit quietly and slowly

348
00:17:45,400 --> 00:17:48,680
Receive the mighty power of the God of Victory...

349
00:17:49,910 --> 00:17:55,190
Seeing the spray was the point of failure

350
00:17:56,450 --> 00:17:59,540
As soon as the screen changed and the fountain starts spraying I knew i'd failed

351
00:17:59,540 --> 00:18:03,000
Nakamiya Shrine of Nikko Futarayama Shrine in the center of Futarayama Honsha in Nikko City

352
00:18:03,000 --> 00:18:04,710
You can visit quietly and slowly

353
00:18:04,710 --> 00:18:09,310
Receiving the mighty power of the God of Victory...

354
00:18:08,680 --> 00:18:10,280
Water's coming out

355
00:18:14,110 --> 00:18:16,040
The water squirted out and I felt like shit

356
00:18:16,040 --> 00:18:18,080
I rerecorded it so many times

357
00:18:18,450 --> 00:18:21,800
After telling the two correct answers

358
00:18:22,480 --> 00:18:26,420
We revealed the ones he failed to get

359
00:18:25,600 --> 00:18:27,740
How can this be ignored?

360
00:18:41,880 --> 00:18:46,340
The five that Sakai ignored are revealed here

361
00:18:43,940 --> 00:18:46,020
How can these be overlooked?

362
00:18:46,020 --> 00:18:47,540
Nipples too?

363
00:18:47,940 --> 00:18:52,740
Sakai San was born in Meguro-ku, Tokyo

364
00:18:52,740 --> 00:18:54,820
Have you been to Kagoshima?

365
00:18:54,820 --> 00:19:02,320
Kagoshima. I came here for a Youtube shoot
-I see

366
00:19:04,090 --> 00:19:06,990
The cicadas! Is that so?

367
00:19:06,990 --> 00:19:08,760
That type of prank?

368
00:19:08,760 --> 00:19:10,900
Who could have known?

369
00:19:10,900 --> 00:19:13,560
It's so nice. Kagoshima is so nice

370
00:19:13,560 --> 00:19:16,730
There's something you can't see in Tokyo.
-Yes

371
00:19:16,730 --> 00:19:20,270
And the cicadas are incredible

372
00:19:19,570 --> 00:19:21,220
He heard it

373
00:19:21,040 --> 00:19:24,040
Oh, it's winter, so is it weird that the cicadas are chirping?

374
00:19:23,340 --> 00:19:25,220
I didn't even react when I heard it

375
00:19:24,440 --> 00:19:27,780
Because I thought it was warm in Kagoshima

376
00:19:27,780 --> 00:19:30,210
So the cicadas are still alive

377
00:19:30,080 --> 00:19:32,170
That's what I thought

378
00:19:31,080 --> 00:19:32,910
Thank you for your hard work

379
00:19:34,370 --> 00:19:37,170
A beautiful background

380
00:19:37,170 --> 00:19:40,250
Thank you for taking time out of your busy schedule
-You too

381
00:19:40,000 --> 00:19:42,280
It doesn't look like it

382
00:19:40,420 --> 00:19:45,020
In this special spring program

383
00:19:44,200 --> 00:19:46,370
Awesome

384
00:19:45,020 --> 00:19:47,740
I'm going to do a whistleblower investigation on show business seniors and juniors

385
00:19:47,740 --> 00:19:52,570
He's not in front of a background, he's actually there?

386
00:19:50,600 --> 00:19:52,800
The actual background

387
00:19:52,800 --> 00:19:56,850
He's always been an active figure in comedy

388
00:19:57,310 --> 00:20:00,400
Takes good care of his juniors

389
00:20:00,400 --> 00:20:04,850
By the way, if you look closely at the background

390
00:20:06,170 --> 00:20:09,140
There's a car coming through

391
00:20:09,050 --> 00:20:12,510
It's not as if there aren't elements that can be detected

392
00:20:11,850 --> 00:20:13,510
I see

393
00:20:13,850 --> 00:20:15,680
That's awesome

394
00:20:15,990 --> 00:20:18,660
No, I can't see it

395
00:20:18,660 --> 00:20:22,570
You went to the spa in the meantime, didn't you?

396
00:20:22,570 --> 00:20:23,170
Yea

397
00:20:23,400 --> 00:20:26,670
The local elders were in

398
00:20:31,420 --> 00:20:32,910
What color is it?

399
00:20:39,420 --> 00:20:41,910
How can you say about this?

400
00:20:42,510 --> 00:20:44,620
It doesn't seem impossible

401
00:20:47,560 --> 00:20:51,860
This guy's nipples are too green

402
00:20:50,820 --> 00:20:52,250
Indeed

403
00:20:53,300 --> 00:20:55,130
This?

404
00:20:57,030 --> 00:20:59,200
How could you possibly find out?

405
00:20:58,740 --> 00:21:00,080
Yeah

406
00:21:00,080 --> 00:21:03,000
Who's going to look at his nipples?

407
00:21:04,450 --> 00:21:06,850
You might think it's a leaf that's stuck to it

408
00:21:12,180 --> 00:21:16,850
You don't look at other people's nipples

409
00:21:16,340 --> 00:21:18,310
Indeed

410
00:21:17,050 --> 00:21:23,190
Well, that's a nice detail

411
00:21:31,310 --> 00:21:33,340
Don't you remember the electricity?

412
00:21:34,110 --> 00:21:36,310
What's going on? How can you ignore that?

413
00:21:35,370 --> 00:21:38,180
That was a lot of electricity.A lot of electricity

414
00:21:37,250 --> 00:21:39,540
This is obvious, isn't it?

415
00:21:38,440 --> 00:21:40,810
It went all the way to the top of my head

416
00:21:42,180 --> 00:21:45,950
But lately I've been wearing sweaters and down jackets and stuff

417
00:21:44,000 --> 00:21:45,820
It's electrifying

418
00:21:45,950 --> 00:21:47,690
There's always static

419
00:21:48,190 --> 00:21:51,020
I thought that's what winter was all about

420
00:21:51,220 --> 00:21:54,110
The last one is

421
00:21:55,030 --> 00:22:00,930
Did you go to any celebrities' homes during this time?

422
00:22:00,930 --> 00:22:02,370
Yes

423
00:22:03,940 --> 00:22:05,240
How are you?

424
00:22:05,240 --> 00:22:07,670
This is Sakai from The Mommy

425
00:22:07,670 --> 00:22:08,370
Hello hello

426
00:22:08,570 --> 00:22:12,080
That's not a good choice.
-It's a bit much

427
00:22:12,080 --> 00:22:14,370
We went to Junichi Ishida's house

428
00:22:14,370 --> 00:22:17,410
On a program called Treasure Hunt

429
00:22:17,680 --> 00:22:20,080
Thank you. Wow, this is great

430
00:22:18,600 --> 00:22:20,880
This is too much

431
00:22:22,880 --> 00:22:24,850
It looks stylish

432
00:22:27,110 --> 00:22:29,370
It's bad. They're bad

433
00:22:29,390 --> 00:22:32,600
Well, that's great

434
00:22:32,600 --> 00:22:35,700
The TV's so close, it's right in your face

435
00:22:35,710 --> 00:22:40,270
Yeah, it's not that big

436
00:22:36,020 --> 00:22:38,940
It's a fancy TV

437
00:22:40,840 --> 00:22:43,670
I've been feeling so bad about it...

438
00:22:43,670 --> 00:22:46,110
It was so narrow, it felt like the TV was this close

439
00:22:46,240 --> 00:22:47,810
The TV is too close to the couch

440
00:22:47,810 --> 00:22:50,910
The TV is huge, but it's so close

441
00:22:51,350 --> 00:22:53,920
Can we go upstairs?
-Yes

442
00:22:54,920 --> 00:22:56,820
Oh

443
00:22:57,790 --> 00:22:59,740
Is this the bedroom?

444
00:22:59,740 --> 00:23:00,590
Yes

445
00:23:00,790 --> 00:23:04,090
Is this where the family rests?

446
00:23:04,090 --> 00:23:05,600
Sort of

447
00:23:05,800 --> 00:23:06,900
How many kids are in the house?

448
00:23:06,900 --> 00:23:08,370
Three.
-Three

449
00:23:08,370 --> 00:23:10,370
Barely sleeps four here

450
00:23:10,370 --> 00:23:13,450
Mostly the kids just sleep here

451
00:23:11,370 --> 00:23:13,080
That's ridiculous

452
00:23:13,440 --> 00:23:17,840
Junichi Ishida's life is going well, isn't it?

453
00:23:17,840 --> 00:23:19,440
That's a relief to hear

454
00:23:22,820 --> 00:23:27,850
That means Sakai got two out of seven questions right.
-That's right

455
00:23:27,850 --> 00:23:29,880
There's not much to go on

456
00:23:29,880 --> 00:23:31,370
What do you think?

457
00:23:31,370 --> 00:23:34,710
Instead, his personal life is a little more difficult

458
00:23:34,710 --> 00:23:36,400
Maybe it's like this

459
00:23:36,400 --> 00:23:37,850
There's feces and stuff

460
00:23:37,850 --> 00:23:40,770
The pranks were good

461
00:23:40,860 --> 00:23:45,370
But Ishida's part was a bit sad.
-It's a bit sad

462
00:23:47,000 --> 00:23:49,710
There's a problem with the selection

463
00:23:49,710 --> 00:23:51,740
This is a horrible program

464
00:23:52,210 --> 00:23:54,240
Such bullies

465
00:23:56,300 --> 00:23:58,750
Let’s get on with our first presenter please

466
00:24:04,110 --> 00:24:08,760
It's FUJIWARA's Fujimoto!

467
00:24:09,440 --> 00:24:13,480
Now that I'm here, you all know what's going on

468
00:24:13,480 --> 00:24:15,610
Eh, it's over, right?
-Yes, it is

469
00:24:15,610 --> 00:24:20,260
Yeah, late last year's smash hit, MONSTER LOVE

470
00:24:20,930 --> 00:24:25,140
Is the last kiss still lingering in everyone's mind?

471
00:24:25,140 --> 00:24:29,070
I remember the kissing scene and the sound

472
00:24:31,980 --> 00:24:37,900
The hourglass necklaces? I want one of those. I did a search

473
00:24:37,900 --> 00:24:39,800
It takes about a month to restock

474
00:24:39,800 --> 00:24:43,140
Yeah, they're selling like hotcakes.
-Really?

475
00:24:43,140 --> 00:24:45,260
No, but... you want it?

476
00:24:45,260 --> 00:24:47,240
Why would you want that?

477
00:24:47,240 --> 00:24:50,130
It was the talk of the town

478
00:24:50,130 --> 00:24:52,780
The couple, Kuro-chan and Richi

479
00:24:52,780 --> 00:24:56,120
What's their life been like since then?

480
00:24:58,290 --> 00:25:00,000
We've got a video, guys

481
00:25:00,000 --> 00:25:02,940
If it's too long, I can't bear it

482
00:25:02,940 --> 00:25:03,900
Why?

483
00:25:03,900 --> 00:25:06,980
If it's too long... shorter is better!
-It's true

484
00:25:06,980 --> 00:25:10,690
This is the second segment today, Right? Is there a third one?
-No

485
00:25:10,690 --> 00:25:12,530
No! It's gonna be long!

486
00:25:14,020 --> 00:25:14,820
"No."

487
00:25:14,820 --> 00:25:15,630
What's going on?

488
00:25:15,630 --> 00:25:17,980
No! It's so long!

489
00:27:19,860 --> 00:27:23,300
The day before the Monster Love Finale

490
00:27:25,970 --> 00:27:27,540
Delicious

491
00:27:30,170 --> 00:27:31,980
I'm sorry I called you before work

492
00:27:31,980 --> 00:27:34,950
We're really seeing too much of each other
-Yeah, right

493
00:27:34,950 --> 00:27:36,020
I just saw you two days ago

494
00:27:36,200 --> 00:27:37,680
I saw you three days ago

495
00:27:37,680 --> 00:27:40,090
I've seen you too many times. I'll see you tomorrow, too

496
00:27:39,900 --> 00:27:41,210
Good friend

497
00:27:40,250 --> 00:27:42,830
What do you mean?
-Today

498
00:27:43,090 --> 00:27:48,130
You'll know all about it after MONSTER LOVE airs tomorrow

499
00:27:48,290 --> 00:27:49,360
Ah, yes

500
00:27:49,360 --> 00:27:50,660
The finale

501
00:27:51,600 --> 00:27:53,770
You know

502
00:27:53,770 --> 00:27:57,840
There's someone I'd like to introduce to you today

503
00:27:57,840 --> 00:28:00,000
Wait a minute

504
00:28:00,000 --> 00:28:00,840
What's going on here?

505
00:28:00,840 --> 00:28:02,810
Wait a minute. Wait a minute. No, no, no

506
00:28:03,720 --> 00:28:05,890
The day before it aired

507
00:28:05,980 --> 00:28:09,250
What's that look? It's a very angry look

508
00:28:09,480 --> 00:28:13,350
Then I'll bring them here

509
00:28:13,750 --> 00:28:15,750
So nervous...

510
00:28:15,920 --> 00:28:17,790
Wait a minute

511
00:28:17,790 --> 00:28:19,120
Hey, are you serious?
-Wait a minute

512
00:28:19,160 --> 00:28:21,090
That look

513
00:28:20,660 --> 00:28:22,920
Didn't expect this at all

514
00:28:24,410 --> 00:28:25,350
Here we go

515
00:28:26,830 --> 00:28:28,210
Kept you waiting

516
00:28:29,360 --> 00:28:31,220
Kept you waiting

517
00:28:32,670 --> 00:28:34,820
Nice to meet you, I'm Richi

518
00:28:34,820 --> 00:28:36,040
I know you...

519
00:28:38,440 --> 00:28:42,310
Well, this is my girlfriend

520
00:28:42,850 --> 00:28:44,260
Girlfriendy~

521
00:28:44,620 --> 00:28:47,990
Really? Really... wait a minute

522
00:28:48,820 --> 00:28:49,450
Really?

523
00:28:49,450 --> 00:28:52,250
I'm seeing her. I'm seeing her

524
00:28:52,460 --> 00:28:54,560
Really? It's not a lie?

525
00:28:52,960 --> 00:28:54,880
Super emotional!

526
00:28:54,680 --> 00:28:56,890
It's not a lie

527
00:28:56,890 --> 00:28:59,260
I'm sorry I kept you in the dark. I'm seeing her

528
00:28:59,430 --> 00:29:03,910
You were with me on your birthday!

529
00:29:03,910 --> 00:29:05,870
It's true. All three of them are crying

530
00:29:05,040 --> 00:29:07,340
Eh, really?

531
00:29:08,190 --> 00:29:11,520
Thank you. Thank you. Please take care of this monster

532
00:29:11,580 --> 00:29:13,680
Not a monster, human being!

533
00:29:13,680 --> 00:29:15,380
I'm sorry. I can't breathe

534
00:29:13,730 --> 00:29:16,410
Must be super happy

535
00:29:15,550 --> 00:29:16,450
Is it really okay?

536
00:29:16,450 --> 00:29:17,280
What're you saying!?

537
00:29:18,450 --> 00:29:21,390
I just want Kuro-chan

538
00:29:21,390 --> 00:29:23,320
With such a cute girl?

539
00:29:23,320 --> 00:29:25,720
This will never happen again!

540
00:29:26,420 --> 00:29:28,730
Seriously, what's so great about him?

541
00:29:28,930 --> 00:29:30,060
Everything

542
00:29:30,060 --> 00:29:34,060
Look past all the gross parts he has a good heart
-Gross?

543
00:29:34,260 --> 00:29:37,630
Wait, I'm really...really impressed

544
00:29:37,770 --> 00:29:41,340
I thought you were going to be alone for the rest of your life

545
00:29:41,610 --> 00:29:43,870
I didn't think it was possible for you to be this happy

546
00:29:44,210 --> 00:29:50,650
You're the first one I wanted to tell

547
00:29:50,650 --> 00:29:54,620
This development is totally confusing

548
00:29:51,960 --> 00:29:53,810
An outrageous statement

549
00:29:55,140 --> 00:29:58,560
Next for this person

550
00:29:58,860 --> 00:30:00,390
Excuse me

551
00:29:59,310 --> 00:30:01,220
Dancho

552
00:30:00,390 --> 00:30:02,960
Ah, hello

553
00:30:02,960 --> 00:30:03,630
First meeting

554
00:30:05,360 --> 00:30:07,740
It doesn't feel like the first meeting because I've been watching you on TV

555
00:30:07,740 --> 00:30:09,230
So little response.
-What are you eating?

556
00:30:11,440 --> 00:30:12,600
Indeed

557
00:30:12,300 --> 00:30:16,810
This is my girlfriend Richi

558
00:30:12,600 --> 00:30:14,120
Before the final installment

559
00:30:18,580 --> 00:30:20,910
My girlfriendy, I got her!

560
00:30:20,910 --> 00:30:22,510
Is it ok?

561
00:30:22,510 --> 00:30:23,480
What do you mean is it ok?

562
00:30:24,250 --> 00:30:25,050
Socially

563
00:30:25,050 --> 00:30:26,580
What do you mean socially?

564
00:30:26,780 --> 00:30:28,000
What do you like about him?

565
00:30:28,450 --> 00:30:30,320
Everything

566
00:30:28,650 --> 00:30:30,330
That's what everyone's asking

567
00:30:31,090 --> 00:30:32,690
Just say one

568
00:30:32,690 --> 00:30:33,570
Just one...

569
00:30:33,570 --> 00:30:34,960
Saying everything is too sneaky

570
00:30:34,960 --> 00:30:35,990
What do you mean by sneaky?

571
00:30:35,990 --> 00:30:38,060
I think he's the funniest guy in the world

572
00:30:38,190 --> 00:30:39,120
He's not that funny

573
00:30:39,120 --> 00:30:40,190
Why?

574
00:30:40,190 --> 00:30:43,570
I really wish you'd come to that live show the other day

575
00:30:43,570 --> 00:30:45,400
It was super unfunny
-No it wasn't!

576
00:30:45,400 --> 00:30:48,270
This guy gets cold feet and then exaggerates and yells, "Don't-"

577
00:30:48,410 --> 00:30:51,010
It was a bad audience, really

578
00:30:51,010 --> 00:30:53,310
But yeah

579
00:30:53,310 --> 00:30:55,010
I don't know if I should say

580
00:30:55,950 --> 00:30:57,180
He's got a girlfriend, hasn't he?

581
00:30:57,180 --> 00:31:02,320
Hiro seems to have gotten a girlfriend too.
-Eh?

582
00:31:00,550 --> 00:31:01,480
Wow

583
00:31:02,320 --> 00:31:04,420
Don't lie to me. Its impossible for a guy like that

584
00:31:04,420 --> 00:31:06,320
That's why it's Double Happy

585
00:31:06,320 --> 00:31:08,490
It's not Double Happy. Don't bundle me in with him

586
00:31:08,490 --> 00:31:09,730
I haven't heard anything

587
00:31:09,290 --> 00:31:11,320
Hiro is a monster

588
00:31:09,730 --> 00:31:10,850
What's wrong with that?

589
00:31:11,320 --> 00:31:15,010
Also, they met two good friends

590
00:31:16,370 --> 00:31:17,910
Who?

591
00:31:16,530 --> 00:31:17,830
Nice to meet you

592
00:31:18,980 --> 00:31:20,330
Not necessary, right?

593
00:31:20,740 --> 00:31:22,470
Eh, wait a minute

594
00:31:22,590 --> 00:31:24,380
You don't have to show this part, do you?

595
00:31:22,610 --> 00:31:25,610
It's my girlfriendy~

596
00:31:25,610 --> 00:31:27,280
We're dating.
-Really?

597
00:31:27,280 --> 00:31:30,010
We're been seeing each other~
-Really?

598
00:31:30,010 --> 00:31:31,340
It's true

599
00:31:31,620 --> 00:31:33,720
I've found my baby

600
00:31:33,720 --> 00:31:35,690
Wait a minute. I have tears in my eyes

601
00:31:35,690 --> 00:31:37,590
Why are you crying?

602
00:31:36,670 --> 00:31:37,900
Everybody's crying

603
00:31:41,810 --> 00:31:43,090
Really?

604
00:31:43,030 --> 00:31:44,390
Cool it
-What?

605
00:31:44,730 --> 00:31:46,700
Surprised
-Surprised?

606
00:31:46,700 --> 00:31:47,300
Give me a kiss

607
00:31:48,840 --> 00:31:50,010
They're in public

608
00:31:50,530 --> 00:31:52,500
Don't. It's disgusting

609
00:31:52,740 --> 00:31:54,910
This is a parallel world, right?

610
00:31:55,040 --> 00:31:57,540
It's real~

611
00:31:59,100 --> 00:32:00,760
So boring

612
00:31:59,680 --> 00:32:03,340
While introducing Richi to people I know

613
00:32:04,080 --> 00:32:06,820
I think I forgot the most important thing

614
00:32:06,820 --> 00:32:08,350
My parents

615
00:32:09,280 --> 00:32:11,280
Very true

616
00:32:09,320 --> 00:32:10,620
Indeed

617
00:32:12,690 --> 00:32:13,890
So filthy

618
00:32:13,890 --> 00:32:15,500
What is this picture?

619
00:32:15,660 --> 00:32:16,660
Hello?

620
00:32:16,660 --> 00:32:17,930
Mother

621
00:32:17,930 --> 00:32:19,900
What's the matter?

622
00:32:19,900 --> 00:32:26,970
There's someone I want to introduce to Mom, so I'll put her on the phone

623
00:32:27,170 --> 00:32:29,170
Eh?

624
00:32:29,170 --> 00:32:31,410
Nice to meet you

625
00:32:31,410 --> 00:32:35,380
I'm dating Kuro-chan

626
00:32:35,380 --> 00:32:37,550
My name is RICHI, nice to meet you

627
00:32:37,550 --> 00:32:42,750
Ah~ Is it really okay?

628
00:32:42,920 --> 00:32:48,460
Really, he's a great guy. I like him a lot

629
00:32:48,760 --> 00:32:49,910
Thank you

630
00:32:49,910 --> 00:32:52,200
It's nice of you to say you like him

631
00:32:52,200 --> 00:32:54,000
What do you mean, "It's nice of you to say you like him"?

632
00:32:54,000 --> 00:32:56,770
Thank you
-I'm so happy

633
00:32:56,900 --> 00:32:59,600
Mom, don't forget to watch the show

634
00:32:59,600 --> 00:33:04,440
Downtown is scary. I don't want to watch it

635
00:33:04,440 --> 00:33:06,110
I'll see you later.
-No, Mum

636
00:33:06,110 --> 00:33:11,380
You always watch the same stuff

637
00:33:11,380 --> 00:33:15,390
Really, don't do anything that will make her cry

638
00:33:15,390 --> 00:33:16,350
Ok

639
00:33:16,350 --> 00:33:17,390
Good luck

640
00:33:17,390 --> 00:33:19,220
I'll try not to make her cry

641
00:33:19,220 --> 00:33:20,890
Okay, over

642
00:33:20,890 --> 00:33:23,190
End with "over"?

643
00:33:23,290 --> 00:33:25,360
Mom, thank you. Good night

644
00:33:25,360 --> 00:33:26,860
Okay. Good night

645
00:33:26,860 --> 00:33:30,130
I'll be happy.
-Ok

646
00:33:31,470 --> 00:33:32,470
So nervous...

647
00:33:32,470 --> 00:33:34,100
Nervous?
Uh-huh

648
00:33:34,400 --> 00:33:38,080
We should get in touch with your mom and dad

649
00:33:36,000 --> 00:33:38,390
What's going to happen?

650
00:33:38,180 --> 00:33:40,780
What are you doing now?

651
00:33:40,780 --> 00:33:45,780
Well, there's someone I'd like to introduce to Mom

652
00:33:44,980 --> 00:33:46,820
Bit worried

653
00:33:46,220 --> 00:33:48,550
Ok i'll listen

654
00:33:48,950 --> 00:33:50,420
Is that all right?

655
00:33:52,320 --> 00:33:54,960
Ah, now I'm on the phone

656
00:33:54,960 --> 00:33:59,000
I'm sorry to call so suddenly

657
00:33:59,430 --> 00:34:00,630
Uh, I'm Yasuda Dai Circus...

658
00:34:00,630 --> 00:34:03,800
Oh, i'm Kurokawa... Kurokawa Akihito

659
00:34:03,800 --> 00:34:05,970
That. I'm sorry

660
00:34:05,020 --> 00:34:06,100
Which one is it?

661
00:34:06,200 --> 00:34:09,940
The daughter you raised with so much hard work

662
00:34:10,460 --> 00:34:12,010
Keep making her cry

663
00:34:12,010 --> 00:34:14,180
Did a lot of...

664
00:34:14,180 --> 00:34:15,850
Ah, yes. I'm sorry

665
00:34:15,850 --> 00:34:17,510
Crying every episode, yes

666
00:34:17,650 --> 00:34:18,640
That, yes

667
00:34:18,640 --> 00:34:22,590
I really will cherish her

668
00:34:22,890 --> 00:34:26,790
I'll arrange to have dinner with you soon

669
00:34:27,350 --> 00:34:30,490
Does Mum have any favorites?

670
00:34:30,930 --> 00:34:32,160
You like meat?

671
00:34:32,160 --> 00:34:35,370
I know a great place

672
00:34:34,370 --> 00:34:35,860
A nice conversation

673
00:34:35,860 --> 00:34:39,000
I'm sorry to call you so late

674
00:34:41,640 --> 00:34:46,210
I'm sorry, i'll pass you back to your daughter

675
00:34:48,410 --> 00:34:49,980
How's it going?

676
00:34:49,300 --> 00:34:51,070
Pretty normal

677
00:34:50,180 --> 00:34:53,950
Nice guy? That's great

678
00:34:54,120 --> 00:34:56,690
Ok, I'm hanging up

679
00:34:55,390 --> 00:34:58,300
Richi is very natural

680
00:35:01,120 --> 00:35:04,930
Introduced my boyfriend to my parents for the first time

681
00:35:06,300 --> 00:35:11,100
So nervous. I'm still nervous. I couldn't talk properly

682
00:35:11,330 --> 00:35:12,740
It's a great day

683
00:35:12,740 --> 00:35:15,740
I've told everyone

684
00:35:15,740 --> 00:35:17,110
What a day

685
00:35:17,210 --> 00:35:19,340
Its been great

686
00:35:20,190 --> 00:35:22,370
It's on. It's on, Richi

687
00:35:22,370 --> 00:35:23,820
Watching together

688
00:35:25,580 --> 00:35:28,720
It's on! It's on! It's on!

689
00:35:30,550 --> 00:35:31,520
Ah, Michopa

690
00:35:33,560 --> 00:35:34,890
Wah!

691
00:35:38,360 --> 00:35:39,800
Tasted Miku's hand

692
00:35:41,430 --> 00:35:43,980
Genius.
-Genius?

693
00:35:43,980 --> 00:35:46,490
That's not exactly genius, is it?

694
00:35:44,530 --> 00:35:48,670
Richi, i've got something right here

695
00:35:46,500 --> 00:35:48,080
What kind of genius is this?

696
00:35:49,740 --> 00:35:51,610
Get it off for me

697
00:35:50,350 --> 00:35:51,770
What's with this guy?

698
00:35:51,610 --> 00:35:52,710
Did you get it?

699
00:35:56,890 --> 00:35:58,410
Why don't you watch the program instead?

700
00:35:58,410 --> 00:36:02,020
Tasted Richi's hand.
-Ah, I love it

701
00:36:02,020 --> 00:36:03,620
Great!

702
00:36:03,180 --> 00:36:04,880
Watch the show!

703
00:36:03,620 --> 00:36:04,820
I got it

704
00:36:05,090 --> 00:36:07,180
Richi tastes better

705
00:36:07,180 --> 00:36:10,060
Miku tastes awful

706
00:36:10,060 --> 00:36:12,000
This guy
-What are you talking about?

707
00:36:13,300 --> 00:36:18,440
I mean it. I mean it

708
00:36:14,100 --> 00:36:16,310
That was awesome. That was very moving

709
00:36:16,310 --> 00:36:19,750
Moved?
-Yes

710
00:36:20,650 --> 00:36:22,260
A classic scene

711
00:36:22,340 --> 00:36:25,510
I've never said anything like this before

712
00:36:24,860 --> 00:36:26,130
Crying

713
00:36:26,940 --> 00:36:28,400
Richi is also crying

714
00:36:30,320 --> 00:36:31,410
Here we go

715
00:36:34,160 --> 00:36:36,140
Don't, don't!

716
00:36:37,820 --> 00:36:39,890
Everyone's screaming!

717
00:36:39,230 --> 00:36:41,040
The tongue is disgusting

718
00:36:40,060 --> 00:36:42,000
Stop screaming

719
00:36:42,000 --> 00:36:45,560
It's a show of love. It's a show of love

720
00:36:46,400 --> 00:36:47,800
I want to kiss

721
00:36:46,530 --> 00:36:48,180
What a mess

722
00:36:48,180 --> 00:36:50,340
Watch the program!

723
00:36:50,340 --> 00:36:53,240
Don't do this!

724
00:36:54,740 --> 00:36:56,650
Wow, it's the same, they synchronized

725
00:36:59,120 --> 00:37:00,440
Ok

726
00:37:00,440 --> 00:37:02,390
So happy

727
00:37:03,180 --> 00:37:07,580
Kissing while watching your own kissing footage

728
00:37:08,100 --> 00:37:10,460
Its novel
-It's awesome

729
00:37:10,460 --> 00:37:13,860
The back of two kissing Kuro-chan's heads

730
00:37:14,870 --> 00:37:17,350
It's like a picture within a picture

731
00:37:17,350 --> 00:37:20,210
You guys, you're forgetting one more thing, aren't you?

732
00:37:20,210 --> 00:37:23,890
The idol group Richi quit, Tonai Boushou (Somewhere in Tokyo)

733
00:37:24,820 --> 00:37:26,570
There's more to come, isn't there?

734
00:37:26,700 --> 00:37:28,740
It doesn't matter

735
00:37:29,380 --> 00:37:30,670
It doesn't matter

736
00:37:30,670 --> 00:37:32,320
Really? Go somewhere else

737
00:37:32,320 --> 00:37:34,840
You can't just watch the video

738
00:37:34,840 --> 00:37:36,420
There's more?

739
00:37:36,420 --> 00:37:37,720
More?

740
00:37:38,210 --> 00:37:40,080
So long

741
00:37:40,080 --> 00:37:41,550
Kuro-chan's in love...

742
00:37:41,750 --> 00:37:44,320
No~

743
00:37:44,320 --> 00:37:45,520
Double, double ready...

744
00:37:45,520 --> 00:37:46,930
It's too long~

745
00:37:46,930 --> 00:37:50,210
We have to support them

746
00:37:51,280 --> 00:37:52,590
It's enough

747
00:37:53,400 --> 00:37:54,720
Let's have a cigarette

748
00:37:54,720 --> 00:37:57,720
Why? Why are you taking a break?

749
00:37:57,720 --> 00:38:00,300
I've been clean for years, but I'm gonna smoke

750
00:38:01,170 --> 00:38:03,260
Is it that bad?

751
00:38:07,040 --> 00:38:08,980
Merry Christmas

752
00:38:10,410 --> 00:38:12,520
It came out.
-That's great!

753
00:38:11,820 --> 00:38:14,460
You really don't know how to clean up

754
00:38:12,520 --> 00:38:13,680
Merry Christmas

755
00:38:13,680 --> 00:38:15,820
Cheers!

756
00:38:15,190 --> 00:38:16,940
She's no good either

757
00:38:19,560 --> 00:38:21,010
Won't clean up

758
00:38:19,560 --> 00:38:21,060
Ah, this is delicious

759
00:38:21,060 --> 00:38:22,160
Tasty

760
00:38:22,260 --> 00:38:23,460
I'm starting

761
00:38:24,130 --> 00:38:25,260
Ah, that looks so good

762
00:38:25,260 --> 00:38:29,730
Yummy!
-Yummy

763
00:38:28,760 --> 00:38:30,410
Really, this guy

764
00:38:30,410 --> 00:38:32,210
The more I see of this guy, the more he pisses me off

765
00:38:30,930 --> 00:38:32,470
Such a happy Christmas

766
00:38:32,470 --> 00:38:33,770
Yeah

767
00:38:33,580 --> 00:38:36,460
Why don't you clean up your room?

768
00:38:33,770 --> 00:38:34,900
So happy

769
00:38:34,900 --> 00:38:37,070
Let's make a lot of memories together

770
00:38:37,640 --> 00:38:39,780
I baked cookies

771
00:38:39,780 --> 00:38:43,350
Eh? Really? No way!

772
00:38:42,250 --> 00:38:43,280
Scary

773
00:38:43,350 --> 00:38:45,320
I thought you never cooked

774
00:38:45,320 --> 00:38:47,310
Well, I don't, but i'm trying

775
00:38:47,520 --> 00:38:51,460
Miku taught me how to bake cookies

776
00:38:51,720 --> 00:38:54,160
What is Miku up to?

777
00:38:53,150 --> 00:38:55,120
Crushed cookies

778
00:38:54,160 --> 00:38:55,130
Indeed

779
00:38:55,660 --> 00:39:00,900
She said "I want to make good memories with cookies"

780
00:39:01,060 --> 00:39:03,400
Well, can I smash them again?

781
00:39:03,400 --> 00:39:05,570
No you can't

782
00:39:05,570 --> 00:39:06,940
I wont, I'm just kidding

783
00:39:06,940 --> 00:39:07,600
Eat

784
00:39:07,600 --> 00:39:09,640
Eh, that's great. That's really great

785
00:39:08,370 --> 00:39:10,560
You're kidding. You broke it

786
00:39:10,210 --> 00:39:12,880
Ah, I am truly loved

787
00:39:12,310 --> 00:39:14,080
I can keep watching this

788
00:39:13,440 --> 00:39:17,980
The end of the year brought Richi's last job as an idol

789
00:39:17,980 --> 00:39:21,760
Countdown TV New Year's Eve Program

790
00:39:22,980 --> 00:39:25,350
A three-person team

791
00:39:25,350 --> 00:39:27,210
Yeah

792
00:39:39,770 --> 00:39:42,370
Thank you for your hard work

793
00:39:42,370 --> 00:39:44,140
It's finally over

794
00:39:47,130 --> 00:39:50,210
Richi is no longer a member

795
00:39:50,210 --> 00:39:52,950
It's kind of hard to believe. Wait a minute

796
00:39:53,050 --> 00:39:55,120
It's been three people every day

797
00:39:55,120 --> 00:39:57,450
I can't believe it yet

798
00:39:58,020 --> 00:39:59,860
No!

799
00:40:01,090 --> 00:40:05,430
It doesn't feel real. It's not real, is it?

800
00:40:06,330 --> 00:40:07,100
It's over

801
00:40:07,600 --> 00:40:09,570
It's over... you worked hard

802
00:40:09,570 --> 00:40:11,000
Thank you

803
00:40:11,000 --> 00:40:15,610
You're the ones who made me an idol

804
00:40:15,610 --> 00:40:16,740
Right

805
00:40:16,460 --> 00:40:17,740
Last time

806
00:40:16,740 --> 00:40:18,040
Really is

807
00:40:18,040 --> 00:40:21,380
You shouldn't be going up and down like that

808
00:40:21,780 --> 00:40:25,080
If you only I didn't fall in love with Kuro-chan

809
00:40:25,090 --> 00:40:29,290
So, we hope you'll be happy as Kuro-chan's girlfriend

810
00:40:29,290 --> 00:40:30,650
Okay, thanks

811
00:40:30,650 --> 00:40:31,960
Be happy.
-I'll be happy

812
00:40:32,510 --> 00:40:37,040
And so Richi's life as an idol end

813
00:40:37,430 --> 00:40:42,340
And the recruitment for a new member begins

814
00:40:42,650 --> 00:40:46,850
For which over 1,000 resumes were received

815
00:40:47,720 --> 00:40:55,930
So, Watanabe, the head of WACK, the company in charge, and Kuro-chan reviewed the materials

816
00:40:57,330 --> 00:41:02,020
Leading to the first round of selection of 100 cleared candidates

817
00:41:02,250 --> 00:41:04,750
How many people do you want to add in?

818
00:41:04,750 --> 00:41:08,890
How many people are good? I'd like to wait until after the selection process

819
00:41:08,890 --> 00:41:11,190
Thank you for attending the auditions

820
00:41:11,190 --> 00:41:13,300
I'm Kuro-chan. He's Watanabe

821
00:41:13,300 --> 00:41:14,090
So, first of all

822
00:41:14,090 --> 00:41:17,100
Please introduce yourself and state why you want to join

823
00:41:17,100 --> 00:41:20,100
And sing a song that you're good at

824
00:41:20,100 --> 00:41:21,000
Then please begin

825
00:41:22,880 --> 00:41:25,680
Sunglasses? Sunglasses?

826
00:41:25,680 --> 00:41:27,090
Awesome

827
00:41:26,580 --> 00:41:29,910
I didn't have a good relationship with my parents growing up

828
00:41:30,050 --> 00:41:32,320
So i've always wanted to be an idol

829
00:41:31,720 --> 00:41:34,500
Why are you wearing sunglasses?
-Do people still wear sunglasses to auditions?

830
00:41:32,320 --> 00:41:35,250
I've said it since I was in elementary school

831
00:41:35,250 --> 00:41:37,700
But I ended up being laughed at

832
00:41:37,790 --> 00:41:41,690
But my parents laughed at me the most for what I wanted to do

833
00:41:41,790 --> 00:41:44,930
That's why I cut them off yesterday

834
00:41:45,060 --> 00:41:46,160
Eh?

835
00:41:46,160 --> 00:41:49,770
A lot has happened, but i'm here today

836
00:41:48,590 --> 00:41:50,060
So heavy

837
00:41:50,130 --> 00:41:51,330
One verse, please

838
00:41:57,630 --> 00:41:59,330
Underestimating the business, isn't she?

839
00:41:59,880 --> 00:42:04,850
By the way, what does Riko look like with her glasses off?

840
00:42:05,820 --> 00:42:09,750
I'll take off my glasses. Here we go

841
00:42:09,890 --> 00:42:11,690
Not bad. But also cute with glasses

842
00:42:11,690 --> 00:42:14,760
But also a beautiful girl with glasses off.
-Thank you

843
00:42:15,120 --> 00:42:18,630
I kinda like the girl with the glasses

844
00:42:20,000 --> 00:42:22,450
You work as a caregiver, right?

845
00:42:22,450 --> 00:42:24,330
Yes, I'm a caregiver

846
00:42:24,500 --> 00:42:26,000
Let me give you an analogy

847
00:42:26,040 --> 00:42:29,140
If I cry, can you show me how you'll stop me?

848
00:42:29,470 --> 00:42:30,510
Ok

849
00:42:30,000 --> 00:42:31,110
What?

850
00:42:32,280 --> 00:42:36,150
Kuro-chan, what's wrong? What's going on?

851
00:42:36,250 --> 00:42:37,610
My toys were taken

852
00:42:37,610 --> 00:42:39,280
Ah, your toys were taken?

853
00:42:39,420 --> 00:42:41,950
I see. Then I'll give you a new toy

854
00:42:42,220 --> 00:42:44,420
What kind of toy?

855
00:42:44,520 --> 00:42:45,890
Bubu toys

856
00:42:46,360 --> 00:42:47,360
What's a "bubu"?

857
00:42:47,520 --> 00:42:49,730
Bubu's a car. Have you ever been in one?

858
00:42:50,030 --> 00:42:51,630
I've never been in one. It's scary

859
00:42:51,630 --> 00:42:54,760
Then let's sit together. It's not scary when you're with me, right?

860
00:42:55,600 --> 00:42:56,820
I won't cry anymore

861
00:42:56,820 --> 00:42:58,700
Really? That's great

862
00:42:58,870 --> 00:43:00,640
Thank you

863
00:43:01,450 --> 00:43:02,830
From that point

864
00:43:03,710 --> 00:43:04,770
How old are you?

865
00:43:04,770 --> 00:43:06,180
6 years old

866
00:43:06,340 --> 00:43:08,880
Six years old?

867
00:43:07,210 --> 00:43:08,650
Is it okay?

868
00:43:09,210 --> 00:43:11,310
Ah, Kuro-chan, long time no see

869
00:43:11,310 --> 00:43:13,750
I think you've forgotten about me

870
00:43:13,750 --> 00:43:15,020
"Long time no see"?

871
00:43:15,350 --> 00:43:18,290
We've had dinner together about five times

872
00:43:18,290 --> 00:43:19,990
Also went to karaoke

873
00:43:20,090 --> 00:43:20,940
Eh, with me?

874
00:43:20,940 --> 00:43:26,560
But Kuro-chan was respectful and didn't try to hit on me

875
00:43:26,830 --> 00:43:27,830
Didn't make a move?

876
00:43:27,830 --> 00:43:29,930
Eh, wait a minute. Five times?

877
00:43:29,930 --> 00:43:34,000
We had okonomiyaki at BochiBochi in Ebisu

878
00:43:34,000 --> 00:43:37,140
And went to Shibuya to play darts

879
00:43:37,140 --> 00:43:39,740
Then back to Kuro-chan's place

880
00:43:37,210 --> 00:43:38,870
Serious dating

881
00:43:39,740 --> 00:43:40,910
Eh, we went there?

882
00:43:40,910 --> 00:43:46,520
No, i'd usually play darts after going to BochiBochi...

883
00:43:46,520 --> 00:43:47,980
Gold package?

884
00:43:47,980 --> 00:43:51,650
And then take someone home, right?

885
00:43:51,650 --> 00:43:52,860
Trying to do it, right?

886
00:43:52,860 --> 00:43:56,090
Must have been tempted at the time...

887
00:43:56,540 --> 00:44:01,550
So, these 10 made the first cut

888
00:44:01,550 --> 00:44:04,600
Successfully shortlisted for the second selection

889
00:44:03,150 --> 00:44:05,770
Out of 1,000 people, 10 stood out

890
00:44:08,200 --> 00:44:10,140
There are 10 people left

891
00:44:10,140 --> 00:44:12,940
How are you going to screen them?

892
00:44:12,940 --> 00:44:16,710
For today, I'd like to keep half of them, five of them

893
00:44:16,710 --> 00:44:18,110
Select five

894
00:44:18,110 --> 00:44:20,450
Then decide

895
00:44:20,780 --> 00:44:22,520
I'm sorry

896
00:44:22,520 --> 00:44:25,390
Can I ask you to sing?
-Yes

897
00:44:31,290 --> 00:44:32,500
Can we stop for a second?

898
00:44:32,500 --> 00:44:34,230
Can you sing more popular tracks?

899
00:44:35,100 --> 00:44:37,070
What to do...

900
00:44:37,230 --> 00:44:38,130
What do you think?

901
00:44:38,130 --> 00:44:40,400
She's a good singer

902
00:44:45,860 --> 00:44:47,680
A good singer

903
00:44:50,450 --> 00:44:55,950
Seems kinda good...

904
00:44:55,950 --> 00:44:57,790
But didn't stand out very much

905
00:44:57,660 --> 00:44:59,200
Judging seriously

906
00:44:57,950 --> 00:45:00,200
I'm 16 years old, I'm a freshman in high school, and my name is Izuki

907
00:45:03,390 --> 00:45:06,360
Senior year, you're still young

908
00:45:06,460 --> 00:45:09,400
Can you put your hair back?
-Yes

909
00:45:09,420 --> 00:45:13,150
A real audition

910
00:45:15,040 --> 00:45:17,140
Your face is so small

911
00:45:17,140 --> 00:45:18,010
Thank you

912
00:45:18,010 --> 00:45:19,940
Like a little bean
-Thanks

913
00:45:21,370 --> 00:45:22,850
What a comparison

914
00:45:24,450 --> 00:45:26,680
Can I ask, are you wearing something underneath?

915
00:45:27,250 --> 00:45:29,050
Yes

916
00:45:28,690 --> 00:45:30,220
Of course she is!

917
00:45:29,250 --> 00:45:31,450
No... I just wasn't sure

918
00:45:31,450 --> 00:45:34,590
Thought you wanted a challenge today

919
00:45:34,420 --> 00:45:36,240
It doesn't matter either way

920
00:45:41,160 --> 00:45:44,070
Longer hair

921
00:45:44,070 --> 00:45:46,240
What does it look like tied back?

922
00:45:46,870 --> 00:45:50,740
It's like this

923
00:45:48,100 --> 00:45:50,320
That's just the way he likes it

924
00:45:50,740 --> 00:45:52,140
Uh-huh. Very cute, very cute

925
00:45:52,540 --> 00:45:53,940
Beauty queen, right?

926
00:45:53,940 --> 00:45:55,550
No no

927
00:45:55,550 --> 00:45:57,210
That's up to me

928
00:45:59,150 --> 00:46:02,650
Why are you so angry?

929
00:46:08,690 --> 00:46:10,690
Shimada

930
00:46:11,020 --> 00:46:12,800
It's not a panty check

931
00:46:13,260 --> 00:46:16,340
Giant's Sadaharu Oh

932
00:46:16,470 --> 00:46:17,930
What'll it be like?

933
00:46:19,960 --> 00:46:21,720
Imitating him

934
00:46:21,720 --> 00:46:23,260
Its the wrong way!

935
00:46:23,940 --> 00:46:24,970
Its like that

936
00:46:31,680 --> 00:46:36,170
So, i'll announce the results of the second selection

937
00:46:36,220 --> 00:46:38,020
First is...

938
00:46:38,550 --> 00:46:45,130
Chihiro, congratulations!

939
00:46:41,710 --> 00:46:43,210
Great

940
00:46:45,500 --> 00:46:46,900
In second place

941
00:46:47,100 --> 00:46:52,270
Sachiko, congratulations

942
00:46:52,470 --> 00:46:56,510
Izuki, congratulations

943
00:46:56,740 --> 00:47:01,810
Nozomi, congratulations

944
00:46:59,360 --> 00:47:00,950
Shimada

945
00:47:00,950 --> 00:47:03,650
No, don't say that

946
00:47:02,040 --> 00:47:08,180
Kino, congratulations

947
00:47:08,740 --> 00:47:12,800
So these five made it to the final stage

948
00:47:12,800 --> 00:47:19,420
Which of them will become the newest member?

949
00:47:22,580 --> 00:47:27,240
So, the decision will be made at a later date

950
00:47:28,660 --> 00:47:35,780
Plus there will be some footage of Richi and Kuro-chan's New Years holiday

951
00:47:37,060 --> 00:47:38,860
Look forward to it

952
00:47:40,330 --> 00:47:42,280
So reluctant!

953
00:47:42,280 --> 00:48:14,710
