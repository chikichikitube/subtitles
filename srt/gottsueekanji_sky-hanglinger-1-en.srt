Sky Hanglinger

3
00:00:05,470 --> 00:00:07,380
Good morning, everyone

4
00:00:07,620 --> 00:00:10,730
Good morning
- Thanks as always for being here

5
00:00:11,560 --> 00:00:17,820
So, today you're all here today
to try our Sky Hanglinger

6
00:00:17,820 --> 00:00:19,700
So, how are you feeling about it?

7
00:00:19,820 --> 00:00:20,700
So?

8
00:00:20,880 --> 00:00:22,440
How do you feel about the sky?

9
00:00:22,460 --> 00:00:26,540
I'm looking forward to it
- It's not everyday you fly, right?

10
00:00:26,540 --> 00:00:28,400
Of course not

11
00:00:28,400 --> 00:00:32,460
As they say, "the devils made the land,
but the angels made the sky"

12
00:00:34,280 --> 00:00:38,740
Someone said this before,
and they got beaten up for it

13
00:00:39,340 --> 00:00:44,800
Today you'll soar the sky,
but please, don't think of this as a game

14
00:00:44,800 --> 00:00:47,540
And remember,
"landing is scarier than flying"

15
00:00:48,860 --> 00:00:51,820
Someone said this before,
and they got blackmailed then

16
00:00:53,440 --> 00:00:55,960
But please, don't forget to land
- Yes

17
00:00:55,960 --> 00:01:00,140
Remember: when you're having fun,
you gotta look out for every danger

18
00:01:00,320 --> 00:01:02,200
Ok? Please, remember this

19
00:01:02,200 --> 00:01:03,360
Got it?
- Yes

20
00:01:03,360 --> 00:01:05,320
Let's fly smartly!
- Sure

21
00:01:16,760 --> 00:01:21,120
Alright, each one of you
will fly in turns, one by one

22
00:01:21,120 --> 00:01:23,380
But let me be clear on this:

23
00:01:23,380 --> 00:01:27,850
The first thing that'll happen
once you lift off, is your death

24
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:32,240
But it's not that bad, you know?

25
00:01:33,320 --> 00:01:36,990
So we have to die for this?
- Yes, that's it

26
00:01:36,990 --> 00:01:38,480
It's going to kill you

27
00:01:38,480 --> 00:01:41,160
But on the brochure, it said it's safe...

28
00:01:41,160 --> 00:01:43,190
It means it's a safe death

29
00:01:44,800 --> 00:01:48,200
Huh? That sounds kind of...

30
00:01:48,520 --> 00:01:50,600
I don't think I can do it
- Come again?

31
00:01:50,600 --> 00:01:52,740
I don't really want to die

32
00:01:52,740 --> 00:01:54,360
What?!

33
00:01:55,580 --> 00:01:59,780
Can't you show us how it's done first?
- No way, I can't

34
00:01:59,780 --> 00:02:01,660
I'm not ready

35
00:02:02,300 --> 00:02:05,680
They haven't arranged
the right model for me, so...

36
00:02:06,340 --> 00:02:09,320
Have you ever done it before?
- Not even once

37
00:02:12,420 --> 00:02:15,260
I mean... can I...

38
00:02:15,560 --> 00:02:18,800
Can I just cancel this?
- Cancel, you say?

39
00:02:18,800 --> 00:02:21,640
He's right, I'd like to cancel it too

40
00:02:21,640 --> 00:02:24,180
Cancel?
- We were thinking the same

41
00:02:24,180 --> 00:02:26,140
Are you quitting?
- We are

42
00:02:26,140 --> 00:02:28,020
Huh, I see...

43
00:02:28,020 --> 00:02:30,280
Can't be helped, then

44
00:02:30,640 --> 00:02:31,620
Alright

45
00:02:31,860 --> 00:02:36,620
Can't we all get our money back?
- Right

46
00:02:36,700 --> 00:02:38,080
Please, give it back

47
00:02:38,200 --> 00:02:40,200
I'm afraid I can't

48
00:02:40,480 --> 00:02:42,280
But when we registered...
- Yeah?

49
00:02:42,280 --> 00:02:45,960
They told us we could ask for a refund if...
- How much was it?

50
00:02:45,960 --> 00:02:47,560
23,000 yen (210$)
- I see

51
00:02:47,560 --> 00:02:50,180
And did you all pay the same amount?
- Yes

52
00:02:50,180 --> 00:02:52,160
Well, I can't refund you

53
00:02:52,800 --> 00:02:55,800
But why?
- Because I've used all your money

54
00:02:58,540 --> 00:03:00,960
I've used every little bit of it

55
00:03:01,460 --> 00:03:03,360
So I can't refund you, what do we do?

56
00:03:03,540 --> 00:03:05,360
So? What now?

57
00:03:05,560 --> 00:03:08,020
Well, you have to refund us
- He's right

58
00:03:08,020 --> 00:03:11,280
Come on, let's fly, don't say that!

59
00:03:11,820 --> 00:03:13,560
That was creepy

60
00:03:14,220 --> 00:03:17,320
Let's fly, come on!
- No way, I don't wanna die

61
00:03:17,520 --> 00:03:22,440
You have two choices, stick with me
or go the hell away

62
00:03:22,440 --> 00:03:26,280
I don't want to do this, I resign,
give me my money back!

63
00:03:26,280 --> 00:03:28,280
I told you I can't

64
00:03:28,280 --> 00:03:30,280
Isn't this a sagi (scam)?

65
00:03:30,280 --> 00:03:32,420
Sagi (herons) can fly, you know

66
00:03:34,180 --> 00:03:36,640
That's not what he...

67
00:03:37,060 --> 00:03:39,310
But I've never flown before

68
00:03:39,600 --> 00:03:41,560
So I'm not a sagi

69
00:03:41,560 --> 00:03:43,540
I'm gonna sue you

70
00:03:43,640 --> 00:03:46,240
We'll contact the police
- You'll sue?

71
00:03:46,240 --> 00:03:49,100
Who are you going to sue?
- You, duh

72
00:03:49,320 --> 00:03:52,320
Huh? What have I done?
- We'll sue you for good

73
00:03:52,440 --> 00:03:54,280
You wanna sue me?

74
00:03:54,440 --> 00:03:57,620
Of course we're gonna sue you
- Me? Sue me?

75
00:03:57,620 --> 00:03:59,580
That's right
- You're going to sue me?

76
00:03:59,580 --> 00:04:02,620
Of course
- And where's your telephone, huh?

77
00:04:03,360 --> 00:04:05,060
Telephone?

78
00:04:05,220 --> 00:04:06,820
I have no idea
- Let's just go

79
00:04:06,960 --> 00:04:08,780
Come on, try it
- No way

80
00:04:08,780 --> 00:04:11,730
I'm gonna die, am I not?
- Yes, of course

81
00:04:12,280 --> 00:04:16,840
But look, I made these salt mounds
as a charm, praying you won't die

82
00:04:17,200 --> 00:04:18,500
Huh?

83
00:04:19,020 --> 00:04:22,620
So I won't die?
- It'd be good if you don't

84
00:04:23,840 --> 00:04:26,490
But I guess you will...

85
00:04:26,800 --> 00:04:29,210
They all died one after another before

86
00:04:29,710 --> 00:04:32,900
If so I'm not riding it
- No one ever complained, though

87
00:04:33,100 --> 00:04:34,220
Of course, they're gone

88
00:04:34,220 --> 00:04:38,160
Come on, don't be like this, man
- Stop it, you're creeping me out

89
00:04:38,160 --> 00:04:41,560
Are you saying I'm creepy?
- I'm not riding that thing

90
00:04:41,560 --> 00:04:42,660
Why not?

91
00:04:42,660 --> 00:04:44,720
Give us a break
- Let's do this, come on

92
00:04:44,720 --> 00:04:48,140
Alright, alright, you won't die,
I promise, now do it

93
00:04:49,940 --> 00:04:52,280
Even if you say so...
- Yeah, so suddenly...

94
00:04:52,280 --> 00:04:54,660
You've been saying we'd die
- We don't trust you

95
00:04:54,660 --> 00:04:58,010
It looks dangerous
- It's fine, come on, let's do it

96
00:04:58,380 --> 00:05:00,060
Don't be like that

97
00:05:00,180 --> 00:05:02,800
Could it be... you were joking before?

98
00:05:02,880 --> 00:05:04,240
About what?
- About dying

99
00:05:04,240 --> 00:05:06,240
No, that part is true, but...

100
00:05:06,240 --> 00:05:08,800
Then I'm not doing it
- Alright, it's a joke, then

101
00:05:08,800 --> 00:05:10,940
So, we're not going to die?
- Let's say it's a joke

102
00:05:10,940 --> 00:05:13,280
"Let's say" what?!

103
00:05:13,280 --> 00:05:14,840
You're not going to die, I swear

104
00:05:14,840 --> 00:05:16,500
Really?
- Yes

105
00:05:17,540 --> 00:05:20,160
It's fine, come here

106
00:05:20,780 --> 00:05:23,940
Let's do this
- Is it safe?

107
00:05:24,320 --> 00:05:27,680
You go first, we'll follow you after

108
00:05:27,680 --> 00:05:30,110
Sit down and put the sky-radar on

109
00:05:30,480 --> 00:05:32,640
Sky radar?
- Yep, the sky radar

110
00:05:35,540 --> 00:05:36,640
Like this

111
00:05:37,460 --> 00:05:38,460
Are you ok?

112
00:05:38,460 --> 00:05:43,770
I warn you, it's so fun sometimes
people never come back from it

113
00:05:44,520 --> 00:05:47,580
So make sure to get back
within 50 minutes

114
00:05:47,820 --> 00:05:50,010
Is he going to fly?
- Of course he is

115
00:05:50,010 --> 00:05:51,920
Can you take the salt mounds away?

116
00:05:51,920 --> 00:05:55,800
No way, if they crumble, you're done for

117
00:05:56,440 --> 00:06:00,000
That's the only thing
I'm relying on for you!

118
00:06:00,860 --> 00:06:03,460
Looks dangerous
- Yes, I...

119
00:06:03,460 --> 00:06:05,740
I don't...
- Alright, let's go

120
00:06:14,300 --> 00:06:16,000
And go!

121
00:06:17,380 --> 00:06:19,700
Welcome back

122
00:06:21,160 --> 00:06:22,940
So, how was it?

123
00:06:23,340 --> 00:06:25,900
Even if you ask me that...
- You flew, right?

124
00:06:26,200 --> 00:06:28,540
I didn't fly at all
- Whaaat?

125
00:06:30,800 --> 00:06:32,220
You saw him flying, right?

126
00:06:32,220 --> 00:06:33,200
Huh?!

127
00:06:33,200 --> 00:06:35,320
He flew, didn't he?
- He didn't move an inch

128
00:06:35,320 --> 00:06:36,770
What the...

129
00:06:37,100 --> 00:06:38,880
Come on guys, he just flew!

130
00:06:38,880 --> 00:06:40,920
He didn't even budge

131
00:06:41,100 --> 00:06:43,330
Let's hear it from him, what do you think?

132
00:06:43,560 --> 00:06:44,960
I mean...

133
00:06:44,960 --> 00:06:49,080
It felt like I was flying for a moment
- See? He did fly!

134
00:06:49,200 --> 00:06:50,980
But he didn't move at all!

135
00:06:50,980 --> 00:06:54,300
That's your personal opinion,
he actually flew!

136
00:06:54,300 --> 00:06:56,960
Cut it out man,
such pranks are so old-fashioned!

137
00:06:57,440 --> 00:06:59,860
Why didn't he fly?
- I told you he just did!

138
00:07:03,180 --> 00:07:06,020
You'll never fly
if you keep on denying he did

139
00:07:06,020 --> 00:07:09,080
Ah, is that so?

140
00:07:09,180 --> 00:07:10,960
Ok, are we going, then?

141
00:07:10,960 --> 00:07:12,880
Let's go to the police station
- Huh?

142
00:07:12,880 --> 00:07:14,620
The police?

143
00:07:14,620 --> 00:07:16,540
And why?

144
00:07:16,540 --> 00:07:18,120
No, wait, really...

145
00:07:21,100 --> 00:07:22,660
Hey, let me go!

146
00:07:35,140 --> 00:07:46,760
