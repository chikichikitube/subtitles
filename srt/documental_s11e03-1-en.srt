[Subbed by Thanos-no-Tsukai
Thanks For Watching!]

2
00:00:23,040 --> 00:00:25,940
I love jumping into unusual situations.

3
00:00:26,710 --> 00:00:29,010
And I thought this would definitely be fun.

4
00:00:29,680 --> 00:00:31,920
I'm getting sleepy!

5
00:00:32,720 --> 00:00:33,280
Ouch!

6
00:00:37,520 --> 00:00:39,220
Not being able to laugh...

7
00:00:40,390 --> 00:00:43,090
...I've never experienced anything like this before.

8
00:00:44,260 --> 00:00:47,730
"Mama, can I eat this?"

9
00:00:51,600 --> 00:00:55,470
So I should just have this expression the whole time, right?

10
00:01:01,010 --> 00:01:02,910
I'm thinking of playing it slow and steady.

11
00:01:08,590 --> 00:01:10,320
After all, I've been on the show before.

12
00:01:10,720 --> 00:01:12,520
So I think they might try to attack me.

13
00:01:12,990 --> 00:01:13,820
I took off my hat.

14
00:01:14,430 --> 00:01:15,730
They know my weakness.

15
00:01:16,690 --> 00:01:21,230
So I have to toughen up at this stage.

16
00:01:21,930 --> 00:01:25,740
I will try my best to control my feelings and make it out.

17
00:02:33,870 --> 00:02:34,570
Thank you.

18
00:02:41,810 --> 00:02:42,310
He kissed him.

19
00:02:47,280 --> 00:02:49,250
-So I have to issue you a card, Takahashi.
-Right, understood.

20
00:02:53,390 --> 00:02:56,230
"Mama, can I eat this?"

21
00:03:00,630 --> 00:03:01,230
We got him.

22
00:03:01,930 --> 00:03:02,870
It's a yellow card.

23
00:03:04,400 --> 00:03:05,040
For Katori.

24
00:03:06,240 --> 00:03:06,870
Shingo?

25
00:03:06,970 --> 00:03:08,170
You had it coming.

26
00:03:12,240 --> 00:03:17,180
Gee, the craziness is starting up again!

27
00:03:17,880 --> 00:03:19,520
Oyakata's reading voice is so exquisite.

28
00:03:19,520 --> 00:03:20,350
I completely agree.
Oyakata's reading voice is so exquisite.

29

30
00:03:21,350 --> 00:03:22,150
Alright, here we go!

31
00:03:25,660 --> 00:03:27,890
Would you all like to do some tongue twisters?

32
00:03:27,890 --> 00:03:29,860
Are we back?

33
00:03:30,260 --> 00:03:31,900
-Tongue twisters...
-Yes.

34
00:03:32,460 --> 00:03:35,570
Let's say each one three times in a row.

35
00:03:35,570 --> 00:03:36,700
Three times in a row?!

36
00:03:36,700 --> 00:03:37,730
-Let's do it.
-In a row!

37
00:03:38,200 --> 00:03:39,240
-We just draw a card?
-Yes.

38
00:03:39,440 --> 00:03:40,270
Kotori, please go ahead.

39
00:03:40,270 --> 00:03:40,570

00:03:57,550 --> 00:03:58,960
They are normal tongue twisters, huh?

48
00:03:59,020 --> 00:04:00,320
They are real ones.

49
00:04:00,320 --> 00:04:00,690

79

So please do Mori Shinichi's voice again.

167
00:07:34,300 --> 00:07:35,110
In Mori Shinichi's style.

168
00:07:35,110 --> 00:07:35,470
-Right, like Mori Shinichi?
-Yes.
In Mori Shinichi's style.

169
00:07:35,470 --> 00:07:36,840
-Right, like Mori Shinichi?
-Yes.

170
00:07:37,470 --> 00:07:39,340
"Boku Bob Furo Babu Tounyu"

171
00:07:39,340 --> 00:07:39,940
That's pretty good.
"Boku Bob Furo Babu Tounyu"

172
00:07:39,940 --> 00:07:42,410
"Boku Bob Furo Babu Tounyu"

173
00:07:42,650 --> 00:07:43,410
Not even a flinch!

174
00:07:44,080 --> 00:07:45,580
"Boku Bob Furo Babu Tounyu"

175
00:07:45,580 --> 00:07:46,420
Can you start over?
"Boku Bob Furo Babu Tounyu"

176
00:07:46,520 --> 00:07:47,250
Sure, sure.

177
00:07:47,990 --> 00:07:49,090
Alright, please go ahead.

178
00:07:51,820 --> 00:07:56,690
"Boku Bob Furo Babu Tounyu"

179
00:07:57,860 --> 00:07:59,860
"Boku Bob Furo Babu Tounyu"

180
00:07:59,860 --> 00:08:00,730
He only did the voice the first time!
"Boku Bob Furo Babu Tounyu"

181
00:08:00,730 --> 00:08:00,760
"Boku Bob Furo Babu Tounyu"

182
00:08:00,760 --> 00:08:01,570
What's with that melodic tone?
"Boku Bob Furo Babu Tounyu"

183
00:08:01,570 --> 00:08:02,170
"Boku Bob Furo Babu Tounyu"

184
00:08:02,270 --> 00:08:03,130
He's almost singing it.

185
00:08:03,330 --> 00:08:04,230
You don't have to sing it!

186
00:08:04,230 --> 00:08:04,900
"Boku Bob Furo Babu Tounyu"
You don't have to sing it!

187
00:08:04,900 --> 00:08:06,870
"Boku Bob Furo Babu Tounyu"

188
00:08:10,370 --> 00:08:11,980
"Migi Mimi Mini Nikibi"

189
00:08:12,180 --> 00:08:13,810
"Migi Mimi Mini Nikibi"

190
00:08:14,310 --> 00:08:16,350
"Migi Mimi Mini Nikibi"

191
00:08:16,410 --> 00:08:18,080
Say it fast!

192
00:08:19,380 --> 00:08:20,050
Is it hard?

193
00:08:20,050 --> 00:08:20,550
It is.

194
00:08:20,550 --> 00:08:21,450
It sure is.

195
00:08:27,220 --> 00:08:27,890
A blender?

196
00:08:28,330 --> 00:08:28,990
What's that?

197
00:08:29,190 --> 00:08:30,290
What's that?

198
00:08:30,890 --> 00:08:33,830
Well, just like Katsunori, I also...

199
00:08:33,830 --> 00:08:37,730
I had a very early flight from the countryside...

200
00:08:37,830 --> 00:08:39,000
And I couldn't sleep at all.

201
00:08:39,240 --> 00:08:42,010
I'm getting a bit sleepy now...

202
00:08:45,640 --> 00:08:46,440
It's Frisk. (EN: 1)

203
00:08:47,510 --> 00:08:48,710
Is that really Frisk?

204
00:08:49,110 --> 00:08:49,850
Frisk?

205
00:08:49,910 --> 00:08:51,820
He pulverized some Frisk.

206
00:08:51,980 --> 00:08:52,680
Looks like drugs.

207
00:08:56,590 --> 00:08:57,620
Is that safe?

208
00:08:58,960 --> 00:09:00,090
-Is it safe?
-will you be okay?

209
00:09:00,320 --> 00:09:01,830
You're not thinking of inhaling that through your nose, right?

210
00:09:02,890 --> 00:09:04,560
That's the most effective delivery method.

211
00:09:05,300 --> 00:09:06,660
Can we really air this?

212
00:09:06,660 --> 00:09:08,030
Of course, it's just Frisk.

213
00:09:09,070 --> 00:09:11,200
But you shouldn't inhale this stuff.

214
00:09:11,700 --> 00:09:15,770
But this is the only way to fight my sleepiness.

215
00:09:16,070 --> 00:09:16,670
Seriously?

216
00:09:16,840 --> 00:09:18,180
I've been doing it for a while.

217
00:09:20,610 --> 00:09:21,810
-He's doing it cause he's sleepy?
-Here I go.

218
00:09:21,910 --> 00:09:22,610
Is it more effective this way?

219
00:09:25,680 --> 00:09:26,480
Amazing.

220
00:09:26,480 --> 00:09:26,680
No, no, no.
Amazing.

221
00:09:26,680 --> 00:09:27,080
No, no, no.

222
00:09:31,660 --> 00:09:32,820
You seem to hate it.

223
00:09:34,190 --> 00:09:34,790
That's so dangerous.

224
00:09:34,790 --> 00:09:35,330
Oh no!
That's so dangerous.

225
00:09:35,330 --> 00:09:35,930
Oh no!

226
00:09:37,360 --> 00:09:38,160
You hate it.

227
00:09:38,160 --> 00:09:38,460
Look at Oyakata's face.
You hate it.

228
00:09:38,460 --> 00:09:39,060
Look at Oyakata's face.

229
00:09:39,060 --> 00:09:39,400
Right?

230
00:09:40,530 --> 00:09:41,970
Oyakata seems a bit mad, no?

231
00:09:45,900 --> 00:09:46,800
Do you always do this?

232
00:09:47,070 --> 00:09:48,070
Yes, I do.

233
00:09:48,610 --> 00:09:49,670
Aren't you worried about people getting the wrong idea?

234
00:09:49,870 --> 00:09:50,840
-Are you okay?
-The wrong idea?

235
00:09:51,780 --> 00:09:52,040
I mean...

236
00:09:52,740 --> 00:09:53,710
The wrong idea...

237
00:09:53,910 --> 00:09:54,610
Doesn't everyone do this?

238
00:09:55,210 --> 00:09:56,610
Oyakata is up to something.

239
00:09:57,080 --> 00:09:58,780
How about we play a game that will wake us right up?

240
00:09:58,780 --> 00:09:59,480
There he is.
How about we play a game that will wake us right up?

241
00:09:59,480 --> 00:09:59,820
How about we play a game that will wake us right up?

242
00:10:00,020 --> 00:10:00,750
Takahashi is back.

243
00:10:01,450 --> 00:10:01,890
He is!

244
00:10:02,190 --> 00:10:02,750
It's been a while.

245
00:10:03,650 --> 00:10:05,420
-It's been a while since we last saw him.
-Right.

246
00:10:06,260 --> 00:10:08,390
Katsunori is finally back.

247
00:10:10,460 --> 00:10:11,560
Ah, Katsunori!

248
00:10:12,160 --> 00:10:13,000
You should do a tongue twister.

249
00:10:13,730 --> 00:10:15,430
I just wanted to give you guys something.

250
00:10:16,030 --> 00:10:17,500
It's a present.

251
00:10:17,930 --> 00:10:20,170
I brought some food from my hometown.

252
00:10:20,900 --> 00:10:23,670
These are called Sukaman, and they're from my home town in Yokosuka. (EN: 2)

253
00:10:23,770 --> 00:10:24,670
Sukaman...

254
00:10:25,080 --> 00:10:27,310
My dad actually made these.

255
00:10:27,610 --> 00:10:28,510
-Really?
-Yeah.

256
00:10:29,210 --> 00:10:32,320
So, I wanted to play this russian roulette-inspired game.

257
00:10:32,620 --> 00:10:33,980
One of these is really spicy.

258
00:10:34,250 --> 00:10:35,950
-Oh, that's scary.
-I see...

259
00:10:36,290 --> 00:10:38,460
So we can play that game.

260
00:10:39,020 --> 00:10:41,190
And maybe we'll get some blood pumping into our systems.

261
00:10:41,390 --> 00:10:41,890
Sho...

262
00:10:43,290 --> 00:10:43,860
Help!

263
00:10:43,990 --> 00:10:45,200
Oh, he can't breathe!

264
00:10:45,500 --> 00:10:46,260
He's running out of breath.

265
00:10:46,360 --> 00:10:47,530
Someone has to take the mask off.

266
00:10:48,430 --> 00:10:48,930
Are you alright?

267
00:10:50,100 --> 00:10:50,830
Katsunori!

268
00:10:51,430 --> 00:10:53,600
He's always going for Oyakata.

269
00:10:53,600 --> 00:10:54,970
-Take it! Take it!
-He's choking.

270
00:11:03,310 --> 00:11:04,780
He looks like a thug.

271
00:11:06,720 --> 00:11:07,250
Thank you.

272
00:11:07,450 --> 00:11:09,150
And he's written the Katsu Kanji for Katsunori.

273
00:11:10,050 --> 00:11:11,120
Thank you.

274
00:11:13,060 --> 00:11:14,520
This makeup must have taken a long time.

275
00:11:19,900 --> 00:11:20,760
What was that just now?

276
00:11:21,130 --> 00:11:21,730
Oh, it's this.

277
00:11:24,600 --> 00:11:25,340
Candy cigarettes?

278
00:11:26,240 --> 00:11:26,800
Thank you.

279
00:11:27,270 --> 00:11:28,070
You're really kind.

280
00:11:28,810 --> 00:11:29,310
Ready?

281
00:11:29,770 --> 00:11:32,340
-Thank you.
-This brings me back.

282
00:11:33,810 --> 00:11:34,310
Katsu.

283
00:11:34,910 --> 00:11:35,150
Yes.

284
00:11:35,850 --> 00:11:37,110
"Onore Ni Katsu"
("to conquer oneself")

285
00:11:37,280 --> 00:11:38,480
-"Onore Ni Katsu"
-"Onore Ni Katsu"

286
00:11:39,620 --> 00:11:41,550
My parents must have been thinking of that when they gave me this name.

287
00:11:41,950 --> 00:11:43,920
My father's name also has that same "Katsu".

288
00:11:44,920 --> 00:11:45,420
-This Katsu?
-Yes.

289
00:11:45,820 --> 00:11:46,660
He's called Katsuaki.

290
00:11:46,720 --> 00:11:47,320
Oh, really?

291
00:11:47,320 --> 00:11:48,190
He made these Manju.

292
00:11:48,790 --> 00:11:50,190
-Oh really?
-Yes, so let's eat it on three.

293
00:11:50,390 --> 00:11:52,200
Alright, let's eat at the same time.

294
00:11:52,560 --> 00:11:54,230
-Let's go on three.
-Okay.

295
00:11:54,760 --> 00:11:56,130
-Only one person's gonna get the spicy one, right?
-That's right.

296
00:11:56,430 --> 00:11:57,900
Only one is spicy?

297
00:11:58,000 --> 00:11:59,400
Is it really spicy?
Will I die?

298
00:11:59,600 --> 00:12:00,470
-It's totally safe.
-Alright.

299
00:12:00,570 --> 00:12:01,770
Will he die?

300
00:12:01,810 --> 00:12:02,970
Alright, everyone ready?

301
00:12:03,010 --> 00:12:03,470
Yes.

302
00:12:03,470 --> 00:12:04,140
Alright.

303
00:12:04,740 --> 00:12:05,480
Let's cheer for this encounter and our time in this space.

304
00:12:05,480 --> 00:12:06,840
He thinks he's gonna die.
Let's cheer for this encounter and our time in this space.

305
00:12:06,840 --> 00:12:07,710
Let's cheer for this encounter and our time in this space.

306
00:12:07,810 --> 00:12:08,210
Thanks!

307
00:12:09,210 --> 00:12:09,750
-Cheers.
-Cheers.

308
00:12:12,220 --> 00:12:13,020
Oh no.

309
00:12:17,520 --> 00:12:17,820
Ah...

310
00:12:24,960 --> 00:12:25,360
Who got it?

311
00:12:25,400 --> 00:12:25,800
Who?

312
00:12:26,460 --> 00:12:27,130
It's spicy.

313
00:12:27,960 --> 00:12:28,530
Katori?

314
00:12:28,630 --> 00:12:30,030
-I think I got it.
-Right...

315
00:12:30,170 --> 00:12:31,200
Sho too...

316
00:12:31,300 --> 00:12:32,240
Is it spicy for everyone?

317
00:12:32,600 --> 00:12:34,000
Are all of these spicy?

318
00:12:34,000 --> 00:12:35,270
-They must all be spicy.
-All?

319
00:12:37,340 --> 00:12:38,240
It's in every single one.

320
00:12:38,240 --> 00:12:39,040
All of them, huh?

321
00:12:39,080 --> 00:12:40,180
It's got red bean paste.

322
00:12:42,510 --> 00:12:43,310
So hot!

323
00:12:44,510 --> 00:12:45,180
Hot!

324
00:12:45,280 --> 00:12:46,880
This is full of Karashi! (EN: 3)

325
00:12:46,880 --> 00:12:47,280
Not all of them are spicy!
This is full of Karashi! (EN: 3)

326
00:12:47,280 --> 00:12:48,050
Not all of them are spicy!

327
00:12:48,250 --> 00:12:49,350
Oyakata, did you get it too?

328
00:12:49,690 --> 00:12:50,150
So spicy.

329
00:12:50,420 --> 00:12:51,320
Right?

330
00:12:52,320 --> 00:12:53,160
My stomach hurts!

331
00:12:53,920 --> 00:12:54,890
Mine is not spicy.

332
00:12:55,130 --> 00:12:56,230
-No way, no way.
-Really?!

333
00:12:57,560 --> 00:12:58,560
He said it's not spicy.

334
00:13:04,900 --> 00:13:05,400
So hot!

335
00:13:05,500 --> 00:13:06,200
Do we have tissues?

336
00:13:07,170 --> 00:13:07,870
Where are the tissues?

337
00:13:08,470 --> 00:13:09,610
He looks so funny with all that makeup.

338
00:13:09,610 --> 00:13:10,870
-It's super spicy.
-Really?
He looks so funny with all that makeup.

339
00:13:10,870 --> 00:13:12,140
-It's super spicy.
-Really?

340
00:13:14,840 --> 00:13:15,550
So spicy!

341
00:13:16,110 --> 00:13:16,650
Really?

342
00:13:23,750 --> 00:13:24,420
-What's that?
-So hot.

343
00:13:26,860 --> 00:13:28,490
-The tissues are over here.
-Oh, to cleanse the palate?

344
00:13:29,030 --> 00:13:30,090
Yes, let's cleanse our palates.

345
00:13:30,190 --> 00:13:30,960
Is it Chanko? (EN: 4)

346
00:13:31,960 --> 00:13:32,900
Chanko?

347
00:13:33,200 --> 00:13:34,330
Hold on a sec.

348
00:13:34,360 --> 00:13:35,130
What is it?

349
00:13:35,930 --> 00:13:36,530
What? What?

350
00:13:36,930 --> 00:13:39,100
Oyakata has brought some Chanko with him.

351
00:13:42,570 --> 00:13:43,940
It was super spicy.

352
00:13:44,770 --> 00:13:46,380
You should use the tap.

353
00:13:46,540 --> 00:13:47,210
Oh, right.

354
00:13:47,310 --> 00:13:48,140
Katsunori, you're alright, right?

355
00:13:48,210 --> 00:13:48,850
I'm fine.

356
00:13:49,110 --> 00:13:50,010
It was no big deal.

357
00:13:51,780 --> 00:13:52,520
Was it that spicy?

358
00:13:54,980 --> 00:13:55,550
So dangerous!

359
00:13:56,150 --> 00:13:56,550
Dangerous...

360
00:13:56,850 --> 00:13:57,620
That could have gone very bad.

361
00:13:57,620 --> 00:13:57,750
Taking that angle?
That could have gone very bad.

362
00:13:57,750 --> 00:13:58,620
Taking that angle?

363
00:14:04,960 --> 00:14:05,600
You've gone and done it.

364
00:14:05,700 --> 00:14:07,160
-You messed up!
-You messed up!

365
00:14:08,060 --> 00:14:10,900
You just laughed so normally, like you were at home hanging out.

366
00:14:14,470 --> 00:14:16,070
That was so dangerous!

367
00:14:17,240 --> 00:14:18,940
So dangerous!

368
00:14:19,540 --> 00:14:20,840
You must have forgotten.

369
00:14:20,840 --> 00:14:21,440
This kind of thing always happens.
You must have forgotten.

370
00:14:21,440 --> 00:14:22,510
This kind of thing always happens.

371
00:14:23,050 --> 00:14:24,080
Every time.

372
00:14:24,280 --> 00:14:29,750
-There's times where you laugh about nothing in particular.
-Right...

373
00:14:30,050 --> 00:14:31,320
-Katsunori Takahashi!
-Yes!

374
00:14:32,620 --> 00:14:33,820
I have to give you this!

375
00:14:34,920 --> 00:14:36,290
An orange card!

376
00:14:38,090 --> 00:14:41,560
-It wasn't that big of a reaction...
-Right...

377
00:14:41,660 --> 00:14:44,600
So let's have a look.
And please be careful of this kinda stuff.

378
00:14:49,010 --> 00:14:49,510
So dangerous!

379
00:14:50,170 --> 00:14:50,570
Dangerous...

380
00:14:50,940 --> 00:14:51,640
That could have gone very bad.

381
00:14:51,640 --> 00:14:51,780
Taking that angle?
That could have gone very bad.

382
00:14:51,780 --> 00:14:52,240
Taking that angle?

383
00:14:59,220 --> 00:15:02,150
At that moment I just forgot about the whole thing.

384
00:15:02,150 --> 00:15:05,920
That's right.
No matter how long you're in here, you'll eventually forget.

385
00:15:05,960 --> 00:15:06,420
-Yeah...
-Yes...

386
00:15:06,960 --> 00:15:08,890
You're so close to being thrown out.

387
00:15:09,630 --> 00:15:10,460
Don't worry, I'll keep it together.

388
00:15:10,460 --> 00:15:10,760
You'll get the red card next time.
Don't worry, I'll keep it together.

389
00:15:10,760 --> 00:15:13,000
You'll get the red card next time.

390
00:15:13,660 --> 00:15:14,430
Alright, do your best.

391
00:15:14,430 --> 00:15:14,730
-Will do!
-Thanks!
Alright, do your best.

392
00:15:14,730 --> 00:15:16,130
-Will do!
-Thanks!

393
00:15:16,870 --> 00:15:18,700
I'm super nervous.

394
00:15:24,040 --> 00:15:26,740
-These guys are so tough.
-Totally.
-There's no cooking oil.

395
00:15:31,180 --> 00:15:32,380
-No, no, no.
-There's no cooking oil.

396
00:15:32,780 --> 00:15:33,480
What a pickle.

397
00:15:34,150 --> 00:15:34,550
You're right.

398
00:15:36,850 --> 00:15:37,650
It's not here.

399
00:15:38,320 --> 00:15:38,820
I need some tissues.

400
00:15:40,260 --> 00:15:42,390
I can't believe Yokozuna made up Chanko.

401
00:15:43,030 --> 00:15:43,730
I'm so happy!

402
00:15:44,260 --> 00:15:44,690
What?!

403
00:15:45,660 --> 00:15:47,130
-Yokozuna's Chanko?!
-Amazing!

404
00:15:47,430 --> 00:15:48,930
-Awesome.
-Is it the real deal?

405
00:15:48,970 --> 00:15:49,430
I'm so happy.

406
00:15:49,630 --> 00:15:50,030
Me too.

407
00:15:50,070 --> 00:15:50,600
What is it?

408
00:15:52,700 --> 00:15:53,400
Let's clean up a bit.

409
00:15:53,600 --> 00:15:54,070
What is this?

410
00:15:54,670 --> 00:15:56,370
They're cleaning all the dangerous stuff.

411
00:15:56,370 --> 00:15:57,240
He's going somewhere.

412
00:16:00,180 --> 00:16:01,110
And he's left the pot behind.

413
00:16:01,140 --> 00:16:02,010
He left the pot.

414
00:16:03,110 --> 00:16:05,720
Why is he leaving the scene?

415
00:16:06,080 --> 00:16:06,820
He's back.

416
00:16:06,880 --> 00:16:07,580
He did nothing.

417
00:16:07,950 --> 00:16:09,590
He didn't pick anything up.

418
00:16:09,950 --> 00:16:11,820
He just took a peek and turned right back.

419
00:16:12,060 --> 00:16:12,720
Why?

420
00:16:13,020 --> 00:16:14,190
I didn't look at his clothes.

421
00:16:14,390 --> 00:16:15,630
This guy is scary.

422
00:16:15,830 --> 00:16:17,030
-What's he doing?
-Is he looking for something?

423
00:16:17,390 --> 00:16:18,060
Chopsticks?

424
00:16:18,160 --> 00:16:19,760
-Oh, he was looking for the chopsticks.
-Totally!

425
00:16:20,200 --> 00:16:21,230
There he goes.

426
00:16:21,630 --> 00:16:22,730
But why'd he go to the locker room?

427
00:16:22,930 --> 00:16:24,400
It was spicy enough to make your stomach hurt, right?

428
00:16:25,240 --> 00:16:26,100
It was super spicy.

429
00:16:26,700 --> 00:16:27,470
Wasn't that Karashi?

430
00:16:28,270 --> 00:16:29,670
It was Karashi paste.

431
00:16:29,970 --> 00:16:31,770
Karashi paste?
There was some inside, right?

432
00:16:31,880 --> 00:16:32,740
Right, right.

433
00:16:33,340 --> 00:16:36,110
I mean, they were normal Manju, but we added the spiciness for today.

434
00:16:37,010 --> 00:16:38,210
For that russian roulette game.

435
00:16:39,080 --> 00:16:40,580
He's not uncovering it!

436
00:16:40,980 --> 00:16:45,860
Come on, you don't have to wait for it to boil!

437
00:16:46,520 --> 00:16:48,420
Has he even turned it on?

438
00:16:48,530 --> 00:16:49,990
I heard a beep.

439
00:16:49,990 --> 00:16:50,030
Really?
I heard a beep.

440
00:16:50,030 --> 00:16:50,330
Really?

441
00:16:50,330 --> 00:16:50,560
I think I did...
Really?

442
00:16:50,560 --> 00:16:52,060
I think I did...

443
00:16:52,260 --> 00:16:56,230
Is he waiting for something?
Isn't it ready?

444
00:16:56,230 --> 00:16:59,400
It's a hot pot so he must be waiting for it to boil over.

445
00:16:59,800 --> 00:17:00,040
This...

446
00:17:00,700 --> 00:17:01,470
Is that on?

447
00:17:01,500 --> 00:17:01,910
Yes.

448
00:17:05,780 --> 00:17:06,480
It smells good.

449
00:17:06,540 --> 00:17:08,610
-He hasn't done anything...
-But he just said it smells good.

450
00:17:09,150 --> 00:17:10,310
It's pretty...

451
00:17:11,310 --> 00:17:12,680
He's keeping us in suspense.

452
00:17:13,780 --> 00:17:15,790
You don't have to make it boil!

453
00:17:15,790 --> 00:17:16,250
But he must be planning something.
You don't have to make it boil!

454
00:17:16,250 --> 00:17:18,520
But he must be planning something.

455
00:17:18,920 --> 00:17:19,860
Waiting for the perfect timing.

456
00:17:19,860 --> 00:17:21,320
He said it smells good.

457
00:17:24,460 --> 00:17:26,160
This is bad, they're wasting so much time.

458
00:17:26,360 --> 00:17:27,930
The other guys aren't doing anything either.

459
00:17:27,930 --> 00:17:28,830
Right, right.

460
00:17:29,430 --> 00:17:30,930
Are they all waiting for the hot pot?

461
00:17:30,930 --> 00:17:31,330
And everyone's silent.
Are they all waiting for the hot pot?

462
00:17:31,330 --> 00:17:32,300
And everyone's silent.

463
00:17:32,640 --> 00:17:33,200
He's loitering again.

464
00:17:33,840 --> 00:17:34,670
He's left the pot's side again.

465
00:17:34,800 --> 00:17:36,570
And the other guys can't do anything about it.

466
00:17:36,710 --> 00:17:37,470
This is getting scary.

467
00:17:39,540 --> 00:17:40,240
Where is he going?

468
00:17:42,810 --> 00:17:43,310
What?

469
00:17:46,880 --> 00:17:49,250
The other guys should try something.

470
00:17:49,950 --> 00:17:50,850
Instead of being silent...

471
00:17:51,420 --> 00:17:52,520
-Right...
-Right?

472
00:17:52,720 --> 00:17:53,920
They've got to act.

473
00:17:53,920 --> 00:17:55,590
They are on high alert.

474
00:17:56,030 --> 00:17:56,790
They should start asking questions.

475
00:17:56,830 --> 00:17:57,990
I'm so hungry.

476
00:17:58,700 --> 00:17:59,200
Here it comes.

477
00:18:00,260 --> 00:18:01,660
-What's his angle?
-I'm hungry as well.

478
00:18:01,660 --> 00:18:02,130
Yeah, me too.
-What's his angle?
-I'm hungry as well.

479
00:18:02,130 --> 00:18:02,670
Yeah, me too.

480
00:18:03,130 --> 00:18:03,830
Small stomach?

481
00:18:04,100 --> 00:18:04,900
Well, yes.

482
00:18:05,030 --> 00:18:06,540
It's only been about three hours though...

483
00:18:07,970 --> 00:18:09,510
Oyakata, do you usually cook?

484
00:18:09,870 --> 00:18:10,270
Yes.

485
00:18:11,240 --> 00:18:11,870
From time to time.

486
00:18:16,850 --> 00:18:18,080
What is he trying to do?!

487
00:18:19,280 --> 00:18:20,220
He hasn't opened it yet.

488
00:18:20,220 --> 00:18:20,580
But you left home pretty early on, right?
He hasn't opened it yet.

489
00:18:20,580 --> 00:18:22,450
But you left home pretty early on, right?

490
00:18:22,750 --> 00:18:24,420
-You didn't have to make all of the Chanko, did you??
-Right.

491
00:18:24,620 --> 00:18:26,120
Most people think you don't have to...

492
00:18:26,520 --> 00:18:29,090
But it's something everyone has to do.

493
00:18:30,230 --> 00:18:35,730
But you were also promoted very early on, didn't your senior-junior relationships turn on their heads?

494
00:18:35,730 --> 00:18:36,130
Yes, that would happen often...
But you were also promoted very early on, didn't your senior-junior relationships turn on their heads?

495
00:18:36,130 --> 00:18:38,900
Yes, that would happen often...

496
00:18:38,900 --> 00:18:39,740
He's not opening it, he's just talking.
Yes, that would happen often...

497
00:18:39,740 --> 00:18:40,670
He's not opening it, he's just talking.

498
00:18:40,670 --> 00:18:40,800
For example, I had to do triple the amount of cleaning.
He's not opening it, he's just talking.

499
00:18:40,800 --> 00:18:43,210
For example, I had to do triple the amount of cleaning.

500
00:18:44,570 --> 00:18:46,940
And that's how I got a strong body.

501
00:18:47,140 --> 00:18:48,140
I see...

502
00:18:49,250 --> 00:18:50,110
Your legs and hips get stronger.

503
00:18:50,780 --> 00:18:52,880
All the cleaning work is really hard on the body.

504
00:18:53,520 --> 00:18:55,690
I would clean really huge rooms.

505
00:18:56,950 --> 00:19:01,320
You also got to train your legs every time you pooped, cause we had the Japanese bathrooms.

506
00:19:03,190 --> 00:19:04,060
Really?

507
00:19:05,400 --> 00:19:06,360
You had to have strong legs.

508
00:19:13,700 --> 00:19:14,370
Here it comes!

509
00:19:14,370 --> 00:19:14,900
He opened it.

510
00:19:15,170 --> 00:19:15,810
We saw it!

511
00:19:15,810 --> 00:19:16,270
I'm so happy.
We saw it!

512
00:19:16,270 --> 00:19:16,410
I'm so happy.

513
00:19:16,410 --> 00:19:16,770
-Isn't that Oden?
-It's Oden! (EN: 5)
I'm so happy.

514
00:19:16,770 --> 00:19:18,780
-Isn't that Oden?
-It's Oden! (EN: 5)

515
00:19:19,480 --> 00:19:20,740
-There was Oden in there.
-It was Oden.

516
00:19:20,840 --> 00:19:21,410
It's just a normal oden.

517
00:19:22,710 --> 00:19:23,410
-What?
-Oden...

518
00:19:23,910 --> 00:19:26,580
-Well, since my days as the Yokozuna...
-It's just normal Oden.

519
00:19:26,820 --> 00:19:28,380
...I have been very good at eating hot food.

520
00:19:29,550 --> 00:19:31,620
I can eat any hot meal.

521
00:19:32,220 --> 00:19:33,060
You can take the heat?

522
00:19:33,060 --> 00:19:34,290
Yes, I can take it.

523
00:19:34,920 --> 00:19:35,790
Hold on, that's just Oden.

524
00:19:41,260 --> 00:19:41,930
It's not even hot.

525
00:19:41,930 --> 00:19:43,270
There's no steam or anything!

526
00:19:43,730 --> 00:19:44,800
It's room temp!

527
00:19:45,540 --> 00:19:47,570
-I'm pretty good at eating hot stuff.
-It's lukewarm!

528
00:19:47,670 --> 00:19:48,870
I might even be cold!

529
00:19:48,970 --> 00:19:50,310
You have to show a bigger reaction!

530
00:19:50,310 --> 00:19:51,870
He's just eating the Oden normally!

531
00:19:52,480 --> 00:19:53,440
-He closed it!
-He closed it.

532
00:19:55,450 --> 00:19:56,910
No, no, no!

533
00:19:57,050 --> 00:19:58,380
Takahashi! Takahashi! Takahashi!

534
00:19:58,880 --> 00:20:01,050
-He's in trouble!
-Guys, you have to make a joke!

535
00:20:01,250 --> 00:20:03,450
Say something!

536
00:20:06,020 --> 00:20:06,320
This...

537
00:20:11,690 --> 00:20:13,100
-Is it hot?
-Yes.

538
00:20:13,860 --> 00:20:14,830
It's warmer.

539
00:20:16,130 --> 00:20:17,430
Can you check?

540
00:20:29,410 --> 00:20:29,910
Is it hot?

541
00:20:38,750 --> 00:20:39,320
Can you eat it?

542
00:20:40,220 --> 00:20:40,660
Is that okay?

543
00:20:42,990 --> 00:20:43,930
It must not be that hot.

544
00:20:44,160 --> 00:20:44,590
What?

545
00:20:44,790 --> 00:20:45,290
Is it hot?

546
00:20:45,600 --> 00:20:46,200
Hot, right?

547
00:20:46,960 --> 00:20:48,130
Should we wait a bit longer?

548
00:20:50,900 --> 00:20:51,400
Was it hot?

549
00:20:55,270 --> 00:20:56,070
It's not something spicy again, right?

550
00:20:56,470 --> 00:20:57,440
What was the point?

551
00:20:57,440 --> 00:20:57,740
What was the point of that?
What was the point?

552
00:20:57,740 --> 00:20:58,170
What was the point of that?

553
00:20:58,170 --> 00:20:58,980
I think we had to wait a bit longer.
What was the point of that?

554
00:20:58,980 --> 00:21:00,540
I think we had to wait a bit longer.

555
00:21:01,640 --> 00:21:02,350
-You think so?
-Yes.

556
00:21:02,810 --> 00:21:03,450
Just a bit longer.

557
00:21:04,180 --> 00:21:05,880
-We'll eat once it gets a bit hotter.
-Right.

558
00:21:06,880 --> 00:21:08,250
-It's really good Oden.
-You think so?

559
00:21:08,550 --> 00:21:09,390
He's totally touching it.

560
00:21:09,990 --> 00:21:10,850
It wasn't hot?

561
00:21:11,450 --> 00:21:12,420
It wasn't.

562
00:21:14,490 --> 00:21:19,260
We want to eat it while it's piping hot.

563
00:21:19,860 --> 00:21:20,400
Piping hot, huh?

564
00:21:20,660 --> 00:21:21,760
It was a bit lukewarm.

565
00:21:22,430 --> 00:21:22,730
Right.

566
00:21:22,930 --> 00:21:23,470
-Right?
-That's weird...

567
00:21:23,570 --> 00:21:23,930
He's touching the pot!

568
00:21:23,930 --> 00:21:24,400
He's all over that pot!
He's touching the pot!

569
00:21:24,400 --> 00:21:25,100
He's all over that pot!

570
00:21:25,230 --> 00:21:26,600
You can't be touching it like that!

571
00:21:26,600 --> 00:21:26,900
But it took so long for him to get the joke out!
You can't be touching it like that!

572
00:21:26,900 --> 00:21:27,470
But it took so long for him to get the joke out!

573
00:21:27,470 --> 00:21:28,970
You're touching it...
But it took so long for him to get the joke out!

574
00:21:28,970 --> 00:21:29,470
But it took so long for him to get the joke out!

575
00:21:29,970 --> 00:21:32,280
Why did he even pretend it was hot?

576
00:21:36,850 --> 00:21:39,320
You should try it again once it's hot enough.

577
00:21:39,320 --> 00:21:39,820
Totally.
You should try it again once it's hot enough.

578
00:21:39,820 --> 00:21:40,080
Totally.

579
00:21:40,480 --> 00:21:46,220
How about we use that spare time and do an impersonation contest?

580
00:21:46,320 --> 00:21:46,720
What?!

581
00:21:47,990 --> 00:21:48,690
I see!

582
00:21:48,890 --> 00:21:49,190
Sure.

583
00:21:49,590 --> 00:21:51,090
Are you guys good at impersonations?

584
00:21:51,990 --> 00:21:54,100
-I'm not very good...
-Me neither...
-Really?

585
00:21:54,730 --> 00:21:58,600
-I'm not... that good either.
-Well, they don't normally do this kind of stuff.

586
00:21:59,240 --> 00:22:03,170
But I was curious about the kind of impersonations we could do.

587
00:22:03,170 --> 00:22:03,570
I totally get it, I'm also very interested.
But I was curious about the kind of impersonations we could do.

588
00:22:03,570 --> 00:22:05,240
I totally get it, I'm also very interested.

589
00:22:05,340 --> 00:22:09,010
I'm not very confident, but let's try it.

590
00:22:09,850 --> 00:22:12,820
I'll go first since I brought it up.

591
00:22:14,250 --> 00:22:15,550
-Did someone write names inside?
-Yes.

592
00:22:15,650 --> 00:22:18,920
That's right, we'll be doing an impersonation of the names in the box.

593
00:22:23,390 --> 00:22:24,130
Pikachu.

594
00:22:25,360 --> 00:22:27,060
Oh, like that, huh?

595
00:22:27,930 --> 00:22:28,530
Pikachu...

596
00:22:36,070 --> 00:22:36,770
Pikachu!

597
00:22:38,470 --> 00:22:39,340
Something like that?

598
00:22:40,380 --> 00:22:43,910
I don't really know... I've never watched Pokemon...

599
00:22:44,680 --> 00:22:45,820
-I just went with the flow.
-I don't know either...

600
00:22:47,380 --> 00:22:48,150
I don't know.

601
00:22:48,850 --> 00:22:49,650
Does he have a special ability?

602
00:22:49,850 --> 00:22:50,790
Yes, he does.

603
00:22:50,790 --> 00:22:51,220
What is it?
Yes, he does.

604
00:22:51,220 --> 00:22:52,220
What is it?

605
00:22:52,460 --> 00:22:53,520
He has the "100,000 Volt Thunderbolt."(EN: 6)

606
00:22:53,860 --> 00:22:54,890
100,000 Volt Thunderbolt!

607
00:22:55,090 --> 00:22:56,530
100,000 Volt Thunderbolt!

608
00:22:56,690 --> 00:22:57,560
He doesn't actually say it.

609
00:22:57,560 --> 00:22:58,260
Oh, he doesn't?

610
00:22:58,260 --> 00:22:59,000
He's a mouse, after all.

611
00:22:59,500 --> 00:23:00,960
100,000 Volt Thunderbolt!

612
00:23:01,130 --> 00:23:01,830
He just said it doesn't say it.

613
00:23:01,830 --> 00:23:02,060
He doesn't say it...
He just said it doesn't say it.

614
00:23:02,060 --> 00:23:02,530
He doesn't say it...

615
00:23:02,530 --> 00:23:03,530
He doesn't talk?

616
00:23:03,770 --> 00:23:05,300
Is Ash the one who says it?

617
00:23:05,500 --> 00:23:08,800
-Ash?
-I mean, you're just saying it like Dayu Koume. (EN: 7)

618
00:23:11,540 --> 00:23:14,240
Ash says the move with his normal voice.

619
00:23:15,710 --> 00:23:16,550
Like this?

620
00:23:17,150 --> 00:23:18,280
That's totally wrong.

621
00:23:18,380 --> 00:23:19,080
Do you know Dayu Koume?

622
00:23:19,080 --> 00:23:19,780
He's totally sleeping.
Do you know Dayu Koume?

623
00:23:19,780 --> 00:23:19,880
Really?
He's totally sleeping.
Do you know Dayu Koume?

624
00:23:19,880 --> 00:23:20,020
He's totally sleeping.
Really?

625
00:23:20,020 --> 00:23:20,680
Really?

626
00:23:20,720 --> 00:23:21,250
You think so?

627
00:23:21,250 --> 00:23:21,850
He's nodding off for real.

628
00:23:21,850 --> 00:23:22,350
He's a very famous comedian, you know?
He's nodding off for real.

629
00:23:22,350 --> 00:23:23,250
He's a very famous comedian, you know?

630
00:23:23,250 --> 00:23:23,890
See?!

631
00:23:24,320 --> 00:23:24,820
He must be sleepy.

632
00:23:24,920 --> 00:23:25,660
-He was sleeping.
-Hold on...

633
00:23:26,020 --> 00:23:27,020
Oyakata, you were nodding off just now, weren't you?

634
00:23:27,060 --> 00:23:27,420
No...

635
00:23:27,790 --> 00:23:28,790
-He was sleeping!
-Are you sleepy?

636
00:23:29,830 --> 00:23:30,960
I wasn't sleeping.

637
00:23:31,460 --> 00:23:31,890
Not at all.

638
00:23:32,260 --> 00:23:33,260
Dayu Koume.

639
00:23:34,630 --> 00:23:35,630
Do you know of him?

640
00:23:37,030 --> 00:23:38,600
-Dayu Koume, huh?
-Damn it!

641
00:23:41,670 --> 00:23:42,370
Dayu Koume.

642
00:23:43,210 --> 00:23:44,840
What is going on?

643
00:23:45,840 --> 00:23:47,140
This guy is very intense.

644
00:23:47,340 --> 00:23:47,910
-Right?
-He's awesome.

645
00:23:48,410 --> 00:23:50,710
He actually wears a Chonmage. (EN: 8)

646
00:23:51,110 --> 00:23:51,680
Damn it!

647
00:23:55,850 --> 00:23:56,350
Is he a singer?

648
00:23:56,690 --> 00:23:57,620
No, he's a comedian.

649
00:23:57,620 --> 00:23:58,120
Oh, a comedian.
No, he's a comedian.

650
00:23:58,120 --> 00:23:58,620
Oh, a comedian.

651
00:24:05,860 --> 00:24:06,460
Not like that.

652
00:24:06,860 --> 00:24:07,630
He does a very high voice.

653
00:24:08,830 --> 00:24:09,330
Not like that.

654
00:24:13,800 --> 00:24:14,900
This is going off the rails.

655
00:24:25,980 --> 00:24:26,980
Damn it!

656
00:24:29,350 --> 00:24:30,650
Look, look, look at him!

657
00:24:31,920 --> 00:24:32,420
It's hard.

658
00:24:33,120 --> 00:24:33,760
Sho!

659
00:24:34,620 --> 00:24:35,790
Sho is in trouble!

660
00:24:35,790 --> 00:24:35,990
Would anyone like to go next?
Sho is in trouble!

661
00:24:35,990 --> 00:24:37,190
Would anyone like to go next?

662
00:24:38,290 --> 00:24:39,360
Looks like the Oden is almost done.

663
00:24:40,060 --> 00:24:41,560
The Oden is done.

664
00:24:42,230 --> 00:24:42,630
Here we go.

665
00:24:42,670 --> 00:24:43,830
What perfect timing.

666
00:24:45,000 --> 00:24:46,700
This is bad! This is bad!

667
00:24:46,700 --> 00:24:46,900
It must be really hot.

668
00:24:46,900 --> 00:24:47,340
This might work.
It must be really hot.

669
00:24:47,340 --> 00:24:47,700
This might work.

670
00:24:47,700 --> 00:24:47,970
It was a bit too hot!
This might work.

671
00:24:47,970 --> 00:24:48,670
It was a bit too hot!

672
00:24:50,610 --> 00:24:51,440
He put it down immediately!

673
00:24:51,640 --> 00:24:53,480
But that's amazing.

674
00:24:54,810 --> 00:24:55,240
Is he gonna eat it?

675
00:24:55,240 --> 00:24:55,510
This is crazy.
Is he gonna eat it?

676
00:24:55,510 --> 00:24:56,610
This is crazy.

677
00:24:56,610 --> 00:24:58,210
He did say he was good with hot food.

678
00:24:58,210 --> 00:24:59,780
-Are you good with hot food?
-Yes.

679
00:24:59,880 --> 00:25:02,280
Won't it hurt your throat?
Are you really gonna be okay?

680
00:25:06,120 --> 00:25:06,620
He's eating.

681
00:25:06,620 --> 00:25:06,860
That's amazing.
He's eating.

682
00:25:06,860 --> 00:25:07,820
That's amazing.

683
00:25:09,790 --> 00:25:10,690
He's super strong.

684
00:25:15,560 --> 00:25:16,230
Look at them!

685
00:25:16,230 --> 00:25:17,900
I mean, he's been eating Chanko since he was young.

686
00:25:17,900 --> 00:25:18,530
Amazing! So strong!
I mean, he's been eating Chanko since he was young.

687
00:25:18,530 --> 00:25:19,000
Amazing! So strong!

688
00:25:19,400 --> 00:25:20,700
But it looks like he's struggling a lot.

689
00:25:20,700 --> 00:25:21,170
Oh no, Katori is in trouble!
But it looks like he's struggling a lot.

690
00:25:21,170 --> 00:25:21,800
Oh no, Katori is in trouble!

691
00:25:21,800 --> 00:25:22,300
He's really strong.
Oh no, Katori is in trouble!

692
00:25:22,300 --> 00:25:22,970
He's really strong.

693
00:25:23,210 --> 00:25:24,670
He's eating it straight out of the boiling pot.

694
00:25:24,840 --> 00:25:26,680
-That's amazing.
-He's still going.

695
00:25:26,980 --> 00:25:29,950
Is it true that the Yokozuna gets to eat the Chanko first?

696
00:25:30,110 --> 00:25:30,610
Well...

697
00:25:30,610 --> 00:25:31,410
You have an order, right?

698
00:25:33,580 --> 00:25:34,450
The Master is first.

699
00:25:34,950 --> 00:25:36,650
-The Master eats first, huh?
-The Master goes first.

700
00:25:36,690 --> 00:25:37,290
I see...

701
00:25:37,350 --> 00:25:39,520
-You should try eating some of the radish or konnyaku.
-Or the meat dumpling.

702
00:25:39,520 --> 00:25:41,790
He did the radish earlier.

703
00:25:42,390 --> 00:25:45,660
And the Jonidan at the end just eat the broth with some rice, right? (EN: 9)

704
00:25:45,660 --> 00:25:45,690
That's right, I also struggled with that when I first joined the stable.

706
00:25:49,530 --> 00:25:50,070
The Jonidan get all the scraps.
That's right, I also struggled with that when I first joined the stable.

707
00:25:50,070 --> 00:25:51,600
The Jonidan get all the scraps.

708
00:25:51,900 --> 00:25:52,800
We didn't get to eat the main dish.

709
00:25:53,740 --> 00:25:54,970
Pick the other one.

710
00:25:55,000 --> 00:25:56,270
He's cooling it down!

711
00:25:56,570 --> 00:25:58,670
He's shaking it up.

712
00:25:58,840 --> 00:26:00,080
What is the point of all this?!

713
00:26:01,110 --> 00:26:02,410
What is he trying to do?!

714
00:26:03,310 --> 00:26:05,610
There's no point if you try to cool it down!

715
00:26:05,780 --> 00:26:05,920
This ain't Yakiniku! (EN: 10)

716
00:26:05,920 --> 00:26:06,620
And don't drop it!
This ain't Yakiniku! (EN: 10)

717
00:26:06,620 --> 00:26:07,180
And don't drop it!

718
00:26:07,380 --> 00:26:07,850
How can he eat that?

719
00:26:07,850 --> 00:26:08,180
Is he regretting it?
How can he eat that?

720
00:26:08,180 --> 00:26:08,780
Is he regretting it?

721
00:26:08,780 --> 00:26:09,350
You'll eat it straight away?
Is he regretting it?

722
00:26:09,350 --> 00:26:09,450
You'll eat it straight away?

723
00:26:09,450 --> 00:26:09,750
That must be super hot!
You'll eat it straight away?

724
00:26:09,750 --> 00:26:10,450
That must be super hot!

725
00:26:10,450 --> 00:26:10,750
What does he wanna do?
That must be super hot!

726
00:26:10,750 --> 00:26:11,020
What does he wanna do?

727
00:26:11,020 --> 00:26:11,650
Really?
What does he wanna do?

728
00:26:11,650 --> 00:26:11,950
What does he wanna do?

729
00:26:11,950 --> 00:26:12,320
Yes.

730
00:26:12,960 --> 00:26:14,590
But I think konnyaku is still manageable.

731
00:26:14,590 --> 00:26:16,190
-No way, it's gonna be bad!
-You think so?

732
00:26:16,590 --> 00:26:18,160
-He's going for it.
-Okay, okay.

733
00:26:23,070 --> 00:26:23,530
So tough!

734
00:26:24,800 --> 00:26:25,400
Crazy!

735
00:26:25,840 --> 00:26:26,600
Oh no, oh no!

736
00:26:26,600 --> 00:26:26,800
There’s no way I could do that...
Oh no, oh no!

737
00:26:26,800 --> 00:26:29,070
There’s no way I could do that...

738
00:26:29,210 --> 00:26:31,170
But he's super tough!

739
00:26:31,240 --> 00:26:32,440
He's very tough.

740
00:26:32,640 --> 00:26:33,180
Egg!

741
00:26:33,640 --> 00:26:34,140
It even has Ganmodoki! (EN: 11)

742
00:26:34,140 --> 00:26:34,610
Can you also manage the boiled egg?
It even has Ganmodoki! (EN: 11)

743
00:26:34,610 --> 00:26:35,610
Can you also manage the boiled egg?

744
00:26:35,910 --> 00:26:36,710
That's too hot.

745
00:26:37,310 --> 00:26:38,380
The radish must be blazing hot.

746
00:26:39,620 --> 00:26:40,680
The radish, egg and the Ganmodoki.

747
00:26:40,680 --> 00:26:41,180
Are you going next?
The radish, egg and the Ganmodoki.

748
00:26:41,180 --> 00:26:41,580
Are you going next?

749
00:26:41,780 --> 00:26:43,290
-Right, the Ganmodoki.
-Yeah.

750
00:26:43,690 --> 00:26:44,390
Excuse me.

751
00:26:44,450 --> 00:26:45,720
It's gonna be super hot.

752
00:26:46,720 --> 00:26:47,520
The egg is the hardest.

753
00:26:47,520 --> 00:26:48,090
The egg?
The egg is the hardest.

754
00:26:48,090 --> 00:26:48,490
The egg?

755
00:26:48,790 --> 00:26:49,690
The egg is dangerous!

756
00:26:50,830 --> 00:26:51,490
Sho... Sho...

757
00:26:52,090 --> 00:26:52,560
Is he doing it?

758
00:26:53,300 --> 00:26:53,960
Oh no...

759
00:26:54,200 --> 00:26:55,430
-That's so dangerous.
-Are you really gonna do it?

760
00:26:55,630 --> 00:26:56,530
It looks super hot!

761
00:26:56,830 --> 00:26:57,270
He's gonna burn himself.

762
00:26:57,630 --> 00:26:58,100
So hot!

763
00:26:58,830 --> 00:26:59,440
Be careful.

764
00:26:59,640 --> 00:27:00,500
The pot is steaming.

765
00:27:00,500 --> 00:27:01,370
Two birds with one stone!
The pot is steaming.

766
00:27:01,370 --> 00:27:01,470
The pot is steaming.

767
00:27:01,770 --> 00:27:03,010
Alright!

768
00:27:05,340 --> 00:27:06,080
This is bad.

769
00:27:06,480 --> 00:27:07,380
Danger! Danger!

770
00:27:18,450 --> 00:27:18,950
Is it hot?

771
00:27:21,290 --> 00:27:21,820
It’s not, right?

772
00:27:22,990 --> 00:27:24,430
He can't even chew it.

773
00:27:25,360 --> 00:27:25,790
Is it hot?

774
00:27:27,860 --> 00:27:28,630
Go drink some water.

775
00:27:30,270 --> 00:27:30,670
I'm fine.

776
00:27:32,800 --> 00:27:34,600
You know I used to live in a dorm when I was a student, so I'm good with this stuff.

777
00:27:34,600 --> 00:27:35,000
Oh, really?
You know I used to live in a dorm when I was a student, so I'm good with this stuff.

778
00:27:35,000 --> 00:27:35,670
Oh, really?

779
00:27:35,700 --> 00:27:36,810
Oh, you used to be in the baseball club.

780
00:27:36,810 --> 00:27:37,940
That's right.

781
00:27:38,670 --> 00:27:43,310
Yes, so if you didn't eat fast you didn't eat.

782
00:27:43,410 --> 00:27:43,950
Right...

783
00:27:44,110 --> 00:27:45,180
But this is really boiling, huh?

784
00:27:46,880 --> 00:27:47,850
You should go for a smaller one.

785
00:27:48,550 --> 00:27:49,250
A radish?

786
00:27:50,450 --> 00:27:52,220
-No way, the radish is the worst!
-It's gonna be hot!

787
00:27:52,220 --> 00:27:53,420
Scary!

788
00:27:53,920 --> 00:27:55,190
Whoa, that's gonna be hot.

789
00:27:55,190 --> 00:27:55,390
It's gonna be hard.
Whoa, that's gonna be hot.

790
00:27:55,390 --> 00:27:56,390
It's gonna be hard.

791
00:27:57,390 --> 00:27:58,760
Could you put it back for a second?

792
00:27:59,260 --> 00:28:00,200
This is gonna be tough.

793
00:28:01,260 --> 00:28:03,630
The egg was too hot, I didn't even have time to react.

794
00:28:03,630 --> 00:28:03,870
I bet it was... Are you okay?
The egg was too hot, I didn't even have time to react.

795
00:28:03,870 --> 00:28:04,900
I bet it was... Are you okay?

796
00:28:05,030 --> 00:28:06,800
But when I was a student I had to eat piping hot meals.

797
00:28:07,600 --> 00:28:11,640
The first years had to prepare the meals for the second and third years.

798
00:28:11,640 --> 00:28:11,870
Is that so?
The first years had to prepare the meals for the second and third years.

799
00:28:11,870 --> 00:28:12,440
Is that so?

800
00:28:17,110 --> 00:28:17,650
You can't blow on it.

801
00:28:18,780 --> 00:28:19,680
You can't be doing that!

802
00:28:24,350 --> 00:28:24,920
Hot!

803
00:28:25,320 --> 00:28:26,120
Hot!!

804
00:28:33,400 --> 00:28:34,160
Course it's hot...

805
00:28:35,630 --> 00:28:36,230
That's that.

806
00:28:36,630 --> 00:28:37,930
-You thought you could handle it, huh?
-It flew.

807
00:28:38,700 --> 00:28:40,300
-Oyakata is in trouble!
-I'm so sorry.

808
00:28:42,170 --> 00:28:43,570
Oyakata is on another level.

809
00:28:43,570 --> 00:28:44,110
Oyakata is amazing.
Oyakata is on another level.

810
00:28:44,110 --> 00:28:45,140
Oyakata is amazing.

811
00:28:45,140 --> 00:28:46,080
-He really is.
-That's amazing.

812
00:28:46,940 --> 00:28:47,640
He did two in a row.

813
00:28:47,640 --> 00:28:47,940
I'm so sorry about that.
He did two in a row.

814
00:28:47,940 --> 00:28:48,810
I'm so sorry about that.

815
00:28:49,510 --> 00:28:50,310
No worries, no worries.

816
00:28:50,310 --> 00:28:52,010
We can't eat it anymore, it's all yours now.

817
00:28:54,120 --> 00:28:54,580
Sorry.

818
00:28:56,250 --> 00:28:57,050
Are you okay?

819
00:28:57,790 --> 00:28:58,220
Where's he going?

820
00:28:58,420 --> 00:28:59,050
He's walking again.

821
00:28:59,620 --> 00:29:00,520
-Why?
-Where's he going?

822
00:29:00,920 --> 00:29:01,490
Why?

823
00:29:01,890 --> 00:29:02,320
Why?

824
00:29:03,690 --> 00:29:04,190
Why?

825
00:29:04,430 --> 00:29:05,190
-Is he mad?
-Is he pissed?

826
00:29:05,560 --> 00:29:06,000
He's pissed?

827
00:29:06,560 --> 00:29:07,930
He got really drastic mood swings!

828
00:29:08,260 --> 00:29:09,130
For real!

829
00:29:09,630 --> 00:29:09,830
Alright.

830
00:29:10,430 --> 00:29:12,000
Who would like to go next?

831
00:29:12,600 --> 00:29:13,200
Shall I?

832
00:29:13,340 --> 00:29:14,100
Go ahead.

833
00:29:16,370 --> 00:29:17,770
Oyakata is not here.

834
00:29:21,810 --> 00:29:22,710
This is impossible.

835
00:29:22,950 --> 00:29:23,350
-Huh?
-Huh?

836
00:29:24,680 --> 00:29:25,180
Hold on...

837
00:29:25,410 --> 00:29:26,780
-This is impossible.
-Let me see.

838
00:29:27,720 --> 00:29:28,350
Should we see it first?

839
00:29:28,950 --> 00:29:29,750
Should we look at it?

840
00:29:30,550 --> 00:29:31,320
Will you?

841
00:29:31,320 --> 00:29:31,850
May I?

842
00:29:33,320 --> 00:29:33,820
What is it?

843
00:29:36,290 --> 00:29:36,930
Is it alive?

844
00:29:37,430 --> 00:29:38,890
It is alive, barely.

845
00:29:38,890 --> 00:29:39,500
It's alive?

846
00:29:39,560 --> 00:29:40,460
It's barely alive.

847
00:29:40,760 --> 00:29:42,330
Can I give you guys a hint?

848
00:29:42,530 --> 00:29:42,730
Sure.

849
00:29:42,970 --> 00:29:45,800
This one's probably really hard...

850
00:29:46,140 --> 00:29:47,540
Is it a character?

851
00:29:48,100 --> 00:29:50,310
Should we not look?

852
00:29:51,210 --> 00:29:52,740
How should I even impersonate this?

853
00:29:54,940 --> 00:29:56,010
I don't know it.

854
00:29:58,410 --> 00:30:00,080
-You know it, don't you?
-Yes.

855
00:30:00,220 --> 00:30:01,750
Then you should give it a try.

856
00:30:02,890 --> 00:30:03,650
It looks good on you.

857
00:30:04,250 --> 00:30:05,820
But we're giving it away with this already.

858
00:30:05,820 --> 00:30:06,720
You have to say "I'm starting to get sleepy".
But we're giving it away with this already.

859
00:30:06,720 --> 00:30:07,860
You have to say "I'm starting to get sleepy".

860
00:30:08,290 --> 00:30:09,890
-Did you figure it out?
-Yes.
-It's something like this.

861
00:30:10,630 --> 00:30:12,260
Like this, right?

862
00:30:13,800 --> 00:30:14,930
These are not the actual glasses though...

863
00:30:16,230 --> 00:30:16,930
You get it, right?

864
00:30:17,230 --> 00:30:18,000
What is it?

865
00:30:18,000 --> 00:30:19,100
Isn't it Naoko Ken? (Jp singer/actress.)

866
00:30:19,500 --> 00:30:20,740
No, it isn't Naoko Ken.

867
00:30:20,940 --> 00:30:22,370
But he said it's barely alive.

868
00:30:24,410 --> 00:30:25,270
Something like this, right?

869
00:30:28,910 --> 00:30:30,510
Oyakata is finally here!

870
00:30:30,550 --> 00:30:30,910
Here he is!

871
00:30:31,580 --> 00:30:32,180
The real deal!

872
00:30:36,450 --> 00:30:37,450
Please.

873
00:30:39,220 --> 00:30:40,120
Please?

874
00:30:40,120 --> 00:30:40,420
Is it a Sumo song?
Please?

875
00:30:40,420 --> 00:30:41,020
Is it a Sumo song?

876
00:30:42,090 --> 00:30:42,790
Now!

877
00:30:43,590 --> 00:30:46,260
Takanohana's impersonation show is about to begin!

878
00:30:46,700 --> 00:30:49,130
First off, we have Takamiyama!

879
00:30:50,330 --> 00:30:51,130
Twofold! Twofold! (EN: 12)

880
00:30:51,170 --> 00:30:51,900
That's so old!

881
00:30:51,900 --> 00:30:53,840
Next up, Kakuei Tanaka! (Former Jp PM)

882
00:30:54,500 --> 00:30:55,370
I mean... Well...

883
00:30:55,370 --> 00:30:55,800
That ain't a Sumo wrestler!
I mean... Well...

884
00:30:55,800 --> 00:30:56,670
That ain't a Sumo wrestler!

885
00:30:56,970 --> 00:30:58,570
Next up, Beat Takeshi! (EN: 13)

886
00:30:59,880 --> 00:31:00,640
Idiot! Bastard!

887
00:31:01,140 --> 00:31:01,610
Idiot!

888
00:31:01,810 --> 00:31:02,340
Comaneci!

889
00:31:03,210 --> 00:31:05,110
And lastly, Shigeo Nagashima! (EN: 14)

890
00:31:06,380 --> 00:31:08,180
It went swoosh, bang and bang.

891
00:31:10,250 --> 00:31:11,720
It is time for the encore.

892
00:31:11,750 --> 00:31:15,090
Do you have any encore impersonation requests?

893
00:31:15,490 --> 00:31:16,330
I do.

894
00:31:16,730 --> 00:31:17,730
Mr. Nagashima please.

895
00:31:22,530 --> 00:31:25,330
It went swoosh, bang and bang.

896
00:31:25,800 --> 00:31:27,140
There's gotta be something other than that!

897
00:31:28,470 --> 00:31:30,870
Manager, how should I hit a forkball?

898
00:31:32,470 --> 00:31:33,840
I just can't seem to hit those forkballs.

899
00:31:33,840 --> 00:31:34,140
R-Right...
I just can't seem to hit those forkballs.

900
00:31:34,140 --> 00:31:35,210
R-Right...

901
00:31:36,450 --> 00:31:38,080
-That's Gushiken!
-It's Gushiken! (Yoko Gushiken)

902
00:31:38,080 --> 00:31:38,110
Oh, Sho is in trouble!
-That's Gushiken!
-It's Gushiken! (Yoko Gushiken)

903
00:31:38,110 --> 00:31:38,980
Oh, Sho is in trouble!

904
00:31:39,080 --> 00:31:39,620
Gushiken?

905
00:31:40,880 --> 00:31:41,550
It's Gushiken!

906
00:31:41,850 --> 00:31:44,850
He's back to being the Takanohana I watched as a kid.

907
00:31:45,050 --> 00:31:46,320
Someone should throw him around.

908
00:31:47,820 --> 00:31:48,490
Totally.

909
00:31:48,490 --> 00:31:49,090
But do they know?
Totally.

910
00:31:49,090 --> 00:31:49,890
But do they know?

911
00:31:50,090 --> 00:31:51,790
I mean, they should know.

912
00:31:52,290 --> 00:31:58,700
"Now, I will ask all of you to kill each other"

913
00:32:03,470 --> 00:32:04,210
"You see..."

914
00:32:05,140 --> 00:32:06,180
"I..."

915
00:32:08,910 --> 00:32:10,110
"About Papa..."

916
00:32:13,580 --> 00:32:16,150
-I have to put an end to this.
-Yeah.

917
00:32:17,050 --> 00:32:18,620
Totally!

918
00:32:18,720 --> 00:32:20,020
This one's on Sho.

919
00:32:21,260 --> 00:32:23,390
He had accumulated a bunch of faults.

920
00:32:23,390 --> 00:32:23,730
Totally.
He had accumulated a bunch of faults.

921
00:32:23,730 --> 00:32:24,330
Totally.

922
00:32:24,330 --> 00:32:24,630
He's the one that set it up...
Totally.

923
00:32:24,630 --> 00:32:27,360
He's the one that set it up...

924
00:32:29,230 --> 00:32:30,930
This one was overdue.

925
00:32:32,500 --> 00:32:34,540
This person was trying to hold in the laughter for the longest time.

926
00:32:34,600 --> 00:32:38,070
And I will be giving him a yellow card.

927
00:32:39,740 --> 00:32:40,980
It goes to Sho Ayanocozey.

928
00:32:42,310 --> 00:32:42,740
Yellow!

929
00:32:42,910 --> 00:32:43,550
Yellow...

930
00:32:44,150 --> 00:32:46,420
You were smirking the whole time.

931
00:32:46,520 --> 00:32:47,020
Right...

932
00:32:49,050 --> 00:32:49,890
"You see..."

933
00:32:50,690 --> 00:32:51,520
"I..."

934
00:32:54,420 --> 00:32:55,790
"About Papa..."

935
00:33:02,460 --> 00:33:04,530
I can't believe that backfired...

936
00:33:05,700 --> 00:33:08,040
It backfired!

937
00:33:08,040 --> 00:33:09,270
You were trying to protect yourself?!

938
00:33:09,870 --> 00:33:11,870
That was quite shocking.

939
00:33:16,950 --> 00:33:18,180
Alright, let's go.

940
00:33:18,280 --> 00:33:19,480
-Alright!
-Let's go!

941
00:33:21,380 --> 00:33:22,050
Here we go!

942
00:33:28,690 --> 00:33:29,290
It's begun.

943
00:33:29,630 --> 00:33:30,930
It certainly has.

944
00:33:30,990 --> 00:33:31,490
We're at the 2 hour mark.

945
00:33:31,490 --> 00:33:32,390
At the very middle.
We're at the 2 hour mark.

946
00:33:32,390 --> 00:33:32,490
At the very middle.

947
00:33:32,590 --> 00:33:33,260
-Right?
-Yes.

948
00:33:33,560 --> 00:33:34,700
Hold on, I'm gonna go erase this stuff.

949
00:33:34,860 --> 00:33:35,230
Sure.

950
00:33:35,930 --> 00:33:37,330
-You guys keep it up.
-Sorry.

951
00:33:37,430 --> 00:33:38,500
Don't worry about it.

952
00:33:38,700 --> 00:33:39,940
Is that gonna come off?

953
00:33:42,300 --> 00:33:43,210
Alright, time to take this off.

954
00:33:43,370 --> 00:33:44,170
Man...

955
00:33:44,170 --> 00:33:45,940
Sho, you've got a lot of impersonation-related games, don't you?

956
00:33:45,940 --> 00:33:46,980
Sorry about that...

957
00:33:46,980 --> 00:33:47,540
No worries.

958
00:33:48,080 --> 00:33:49,310
I wanna give it a try.

959
00:33:49,550 --> 00:33:50,150
Impersonation?

960
00:33:50,210 --> 00:33:50,610
Yes.

961
00:33:52,080 --> 00:33:53,620
I might have put in way too many names.

962
00:33:53,720 --> 00:33:55,580
I might have messed up.

963
00:34:00,460 --> 00:34:01,520
There's tons of names here.

964
00:34:01,720 --> 00:34:02,120
That's right.

965
00:34:02,120 --> 00:34:02,690
There's that many?
That's right.

966
00:34:02,690 --> 00:34:03,230
There's that many?

967
00:34:07,360 --> 00:34:10,130
Satomi Ishihara.

968
00:34:10,230 --> 00:34:11,700
That's gonna be hard.

969
00:34:12,100 --> 00:34:13,200
Yeah, it's a tough one.

970
00:34:19,140 --> 00:34:20,280
I'm an actress.

971
00:34:21,740 --> 00:34:22,140
That's too general!

972
00:34:22,140 --> 00:34:22,710
An actress?
That's too general!

973
00:34:22,710 --> 00:34:23,410
An actress?

974
00:34:23,950 --> 00:34:24,980
What kind of person are you?

975
00:34:24,980 --> 00:34:25,980
Someone that would say "I'm an actress"?
What kind of person are you?

976
00:34:25,980 --> 00:34:25,980
Someone that would say "I'm an actress"?

977
00:34:25,980 --> 00:34:26,780
An actress that would say "I'm an actress", right?
Someone that would say "I'm an actress"?

978
00:34:26,780 --> 00:34:28,980
An actress that would say "I'm an actress", right?

979
00:34:31,450 --> 00:34:32,220
Who could it be?

980
00:34:33,660 --> 00:34:34,520
I'm very popular.

981
00:34:35,190 --> 00:34:36,290
-Hold on...
-That's not specific at all.

982
00:34:36,530 --> 00:34:37,090
Very popular?

983
00:34:37,090 --> 00:34:37,690
She's never said that!
Very popular?

984
00:34:37,690 --> 00:34:38,360
She's never said that!

985
00:34:38,360 --> 00:34:39,800
She would never!

986
00:34:45,530 --> 00:34:45,930
Yes?

987
00:34:46,700 --> 00:34:47,840
Come on...

988
00:34:47,840 --> 00:34:48,970
There's no way they'll ever figure it out...

989
00:34:49,100 --> 00:34:50,170
That's so random...

990
00:34:50,170 --> 00:34:50,670
I mean, are they playing charades or what?
That's so random...

991
00:34:50,670 --> 00:34:52,140
I mean, are they playing charades or what?

992
00:34:52,540 --> 00:34:54,940
I have acted with her.

993
00:34:55,310 --> 00:34:57,050
Hold on, you just went back to being yourself.

994
00:34:58,050 --> 00:34:59,210
You're changing characters.

995
00:34:59,580 --> 00:35:00,520
Were you talking as Shingo right now?

996
00:35:01,020 --> 00:35:01,420
Now...

997
00:35:05,850 --> 00:35:09,490
I-I might be taking a break from acting at the moment...

998
00:35:09,690 --> 00:35:11,530
She's taking a break?

999
00:35:11,760 --> 00:35:12,560
Well, yeah...

1000
00:35:13,160 --> 00:35:14,060
She's taking a break... Ah!

1001
00:35:14,360 --> 00:35:15,230
Ehm...

1002
00:35:15,830 --> 00:35:16,630
Ehm...

1003
00:35:17,470 --> 00:35:18,400
Satomi Ishihara!

1004
00:35:19,700 --> 00:35:20,300
Alright!

1005
00:35:22,270 --> 00:35:23,870
Oyakata did nothing just now.

1006
00:35:23,870 --> 00:35:24,940
Oyakata!

1007
00:35:24,940 --> 00:35:25,270
Nothing at all.
Oyakata!

1008
00:35:25,270 --> 00:35:25,370
Nothing at all.

1009
00:35:25,370 --> 00:35:25,540
But I don't think she speaks like that.
Nothing at all.

1010
00:35:25,540 --> 00:35:26,880
But I don't think she speaks like that.

1011
00:35:26,880 --> 00:35:26,980
I don't know about that.
But I don't think she speaks like that.

1012
00:35:26,980 --> 00:35:27,740
I don't know about that.

1013
00:35:28,810 --> 00:35:30,310
That was not an impersonation, right?

1014
00:35:30,350 --> 00:35:32,110
Oyakata is scaring me.

1015
00:35:34,380 --> 00:35:35,150
I have actually worked with her.

1016
00:35:35,350 --> 00:35:36,180
So you must know her well.

1017
00:35:36,180 --> 00:35:36,550
But you did act a bit like her.
So you must know her well.

1018
00:35:36,550 --> 00:35:37,450
But you did act a bit like her.

1019
00:35:37,490 --> 00:35:38,320
-I don't think he did...
-It wasn't close at all...

1020
00:35:38,320 --> 00:35:38,820
Would you like to try?
-I don't think he did...
-It wasn't close at all...

1021
00:35:38,820 --> 00:35:39,550
Would you like to try?

1022
00:35:40,160 --> 00:35:42,390
-You should give it a go.
-Please go ahead.

1023
00:35:42,790 --> 00:35:43,530
Over here.

1024
00:35:44,430 --> 00:35:45,260
Shingo!

1025
00:35:45,390 --> 00:35:45,660
Huh?

1026
00:35:46,090 --> 00:35:47,300
I have always loved you!

1027
00:35:48,330 --> 00:35:51,230
I never should have married that man, and instead married you!

1028
00:35:51,230 --> 00:35:51,470
She'd never say that.
I never should have married that man, and instead married you!

1029
00:35:51,470 --> 00:35:51,700
She'd never say that.

1030
00:35:51,700 --> 00:35:52,000
He just said the worst thing...
She'd never say that.

1031
00:35:52,000 --> 00:35:52,900
He just said the worst thing...

1032
00:35:53,500 --> 00:35:55,370
He said a horrible thing...

1033
00:35:55,400 --> 00:35:55,970
That's no good.

1034
00:35:55,970 --> 00:35:56,470
Really?

1035
00:35:56,470 --> 00:35:56,970
-Yes...-Yes...

1036
00:35:57,110 --> 00:35:58,110
Alright, I'll try again.

1037
00:35:58,870 --> 00:35:59,540
"That man"?

1038
00:35:59,540 --> 00:36:00,040
What's with the sharp tongue all of a sudden?
"That man"?

1039
00:36:00,040 --> 00:36:01,340
What's with the sharp tongue all of a sudden?

1040
00:36:01,540 --> 00:36:03,310
I'm glad I married that man...

1041
00:36:03,810 --> 00:36:05,580
But I've always loved you more.

1042
00:36:05,580 --> 00:36:06,580
-Can't say that either.
-Really?

1043
00:36:06,920 --> 00:36:08,480
Guys, I want you to take a look at this.

1044
00:36:08,550 --> 00:36:09,550
Oh, he's back.

1045
00:36:09,750 --> 00:36:10,450
It's amazing.

1046
00:36:10,550 --> 00:36:12,420
You see... At my age...

1047
00:36:13,020 --> 00:36:14,960
I still get fan letters.

1048
00:36:15,590 --> 00:36:16,090
Right...

1049
00:36:19,860 --> 00:36:23,670
And some of them are quite strange...

1050
00:36:25,500 --> 00:36:26,300
So I want you to have a look.

1051
00:36:27,040 --> 00:36:28,200
-Whoa, amazing!
-Fan letters!

1052
00:36:28,200 --> 00:36:28,900
You get this many?

1053
00:36:28,900 --> 00:36:29,170
Amazing.
You get this many?

1054
00:36:29,170 --> 00:36:29,400
Amazing.

1055
00:36:29,400 --> 00:36:29,600
Surprisingly, I get quite a lot of these.
Amazing.

1056
00:36:29,600 --> 00:36:31,370
Surprisingly, I get quite a lot of these.

1057
00:36:31,470 --> 00:36:32,470
And you put them in a Ziplock?

1058
00:36:33,040 --> 00:36:34,080
I put them in a Ziplock.

1059
00:36:37,710 --> 00:36:39,580
"Mr. Katsunori Takahashi"
"Hello"

1060
00:36:40,180 --> 00:36:43,290
"I'm always looking forward to all your work, I am a big fan"

1061
00:36:43,450 --> 00:36:45,120
They often start with something like this.

1062
00:36:45,620 --> 00:36:46,960
I'm sure you guys also get tons of these.

1063
00:36:47,120 --> 00:36:51,390
"I became addicted to your sexiness and adult appeal after watching you in Mr. Tadano's Secret Mission"

1064
00:36:51,490 --> 00:36:52,160
-Right...
-I watched it too...

1065
00:36:52,390 --> 00:36:55,460
"Nowadays, watching you is my reason to live."
"Thank you."

1066
00:36:55,830 --> 00:36:59,100
"I wanted to give you something that would make you happy, so I drew a portrait of your smiling face."

1067
00:36:59,600 --> 00:37:02,200
"I don't mean to be presumptuous, but it would make me extremely happy if you could hang it somewhere."

1068
00:37:02,200 --> 00:37:02,900
That's so nice.
"I don't mean to be presumptuous, but it would make me extremely happy if you could hang it somewhere."

1069
00:37:02,900 --> 00:37:03,570
That's so nice.

1070
00:37:03,710 --> 00:37:05,770
-I'm so grateful for that.
-That's so great.

1071
00:37:05,770 --> 00:37:07,580
And this is the drawing.

1072
00:37:08,040 --> 00:37:08,710
Let's see.

1073
00:37:08,710 --> 00:37:09,510
That's amazing.

1074
00:37:11,210 --> 00:37:11,710
This is it.

1075
00:37:13,880 --> 00:37:14,480
Who's this?

1076
00:37:15,650 --> 00:37:17,350
-That's Katsumi...
-It's Katsumi Takahashi... (Japanese actor/VA)

1077
00:37:17,950 --> 00:37:19,920
-He certainly is Mr. Takahashi...
-Isn't that Katsumi?

1078
00:37:20,420 --> 00:37:21,620
One Kanji is wrong.

1079
00:37:22,620 --> 00:37:24,490
-He wasn't in Mr. Tadano's Secret Mission though...
-Right, one Kanji is wrong...

1080
00:37:24,490 --> 00:37:25,890
That's Katsumi Takahashi, isn't he?

1081
00:37:26,090 --> 00:37:27,060
I don't think so...

1082
00:37:27,300 --> 00:37:28,060
Really?

1083
00:37:28,660 --> 00:37:30,430
-He's not in Mr. Tadano's Secret Mission, right?
-Yeah, he isn't.

1084
00:37:30,470 --> 00:37:31,730
Alright, I'm going to the next letter.

1085
00:37:32,030 --> 00:37:33,000
-Are you moving on?
-Yes.

1086
00:37:34,800 --> 00:37:36,070
"Mr. Katsunori Takahashi, nice to meet you"

1087
00:37:36,070 --> 00:37:38,670
"I am a senior woman, and I just turned 75 this year"

1088
00:37:39,140 --> 00:37:39,740
There's a lot of range.

1089
00:37:40,180 --> 00:37:43,040
"Watching your acting has become one of favorite things to do"

1090
00:37:43,310 --> 00:37:46,480
"Recently, I have started attending an India-ink painting class"

1091
00:37:47,220 --> 00:37:51,590
"I'm still inexperienced but I hope you'll like the drawing"

1092
00:37:51,750 --> 00:37:55,690
Another drawing?
You seem to have a lot of artist fans.

1093
00:37:55,690 --> 00:37:56,290
Yes...
Another drawing?
You seem to have a lot of artist fans.

1094
00:37:56,290 --> 00:37:56,830
Yes...

1095
00:37:56,990 --> 00:37:57,790
This is the drawing.

1096
00:37:57,890 --> 00:37:58,760
It's an ink painting.

1097
00:37:59,090 --> 00:38:00,360
-But that's Katsumi.
-It's Katsumi again.

1098
00:38:00,560 --> 00:38:01,930
Does Katsumi have a lot of fans?

1099
00:38:02,430 --> 00:38:03,830
That's Katsumi, right?

1100
00:38:04,830 --> 00:38:05,530
Totally!

1101
00:38:06,100 --> 00:38:08,040
Is everyone getting confused with your names?

1102
00:38:08,470 --> 00:38:09,600
I mean, certainly...

1103
00:38:09,770 --> 00:38:13,340
Whenever we work together I have certainly mistook his changing room for mine.

1104
00:38:13,780 --> 00:38:15,110
This person is from overseas.

1105
00:38:16,410 --> 00:38:18,250
"You are a wonderful actor"

1106
00:38:18,680 --> 00:38:20,120
"I drew a picture of you"

1107
00:38:20,480 --> 00:38:21,950
-Another painting?
-That's so cool.

1108
00:38:22,380 --> 00:38:22,950
A picture?

1109
00:38:25,220 --> 00:38:25,720
There you go.

1110
00:38:25,720 --> 00:38:25,920
Isn't that a Banksy?
There you go.

1111
00:38:25,920 --> 00:38:26,660
Isn't that a Banksy?

1112
00:38:26,660 --> 00:38:26,820
This one's coming from Banksy, isn't it?
Isn't that a Banksy?

1113
00:38:26,820 --> 00:38:28,120
This one's coming from Banksy, isn't it?

1114
00:38:28,120 --> 00:38:28,990
And it's Katsumi again.
This one's coming from Banksy, isn't it?

1115
00:38:28,990 --> 00:38:29,590
And it's Katsumi again.

1116
00:38:29,590 --> 00:38:29,930
Katsu-Bansky.
And it's Katsumi again.

1117
00:38:29,930 --> 00:38:30,590
Katsu-Bansky.

1118
00:38:31,430 --> 00:38:32,260
This is crazy.

1119
00:38:32,260 --> 00:38:33,300
This looks like me, no?

1120
00:38:33,460 --> 00:38:34,500
-What does he mean by 'crazy'?
-That's amazing.

1121
00:38:34,560 --> 00:38:34,960
Crazy?

1122
00:38:34,960 --> 00:38:35,530
Oyakata, what do you think?
Crazy?

1123
00:38:35,530 --> 00:38:35,930
Oyakata, what do you think?

1124
00:38:37,430 --> 00:38:39,400
-It could or could not be you...
-It's definitely not him.

1125
00:38:40,900 --> 00:38:42,870
He ain't getting it at all!

1126
00:38:44,270 --> 00:38:45,540
-Banksy?
-Banksy!

1127
00:38:45,640 --> 00:38:47,380
-This is a Banksy!
-Bansky sent it to you!

1128
00:38:47,840 --> 00:38:50,010
Banksy drew Katsumi.

1129
00:38:50,110 --> 00:38:51,610
And then he sent it to you...

1130
00:38:51,880 --> 00:38:52,880
Isn't that amazing?

1131
00:38:53,010 --> 00:38:56,550
Should we send one of you guys in there?

1132
00:38:56,850 --> 00:39:00,820
You'll step inside and stir things up a bit.

1133
00:39:01,260 --> 00:39:04,130
I just want to blow some fresh air in that room.

1134
00:39:04,930 --> 00:39:05,960
How about it?

1135
00:39:06,460 --> 00:39:08,830
-Goto, you wanna go?
-Should I?

1136
00:39:09,730 --> 00:39:11,470
Alright, so I can laugh, right?

1137
00:39:11,530 --> 00:39:12,600
Yes, don't worry about it.

1138
00:39:13,100 --> 00:39:13,800
Thank you for showing us that.

1139
00:39:14,700 --> 00:39:15,670
I'll be back!

1140
00:39:15,870 --> 00:39:18,070
Let's change the atmosphere.

1141
00:39:18,070 --> 00:39:18,370
Are we done with the impersonations?
Let's change the atmosphere.

1142
00:39:18,370 --> 00:39:19,040
Are we done with the impersonations?

1143
00:39:19,070 --> 00:39:19,840
We were doing it just now.

1144
00:39:20,640 --> 00:39:21,180
Hello!

1145
00:39:23,310 --> 00:39:23,850
Excuse me.

1146
00:39:24,850 --> 00:39:25,580
-Hello everyone.
-Hello.

1147
00:39:25,680 --> 00:39:26,080
Oh my...

1148
00:39:26,180 --> 00:39:26,880
-Yes?
-Yes?

1149
00:39:27,380 --> 00:39:29,680
We still aren't allowed to laugh, right?

1150
00:39:29,950 --> 00:39:31,190
-Of course.
-Right.

1151
00:39:31,250 --> 00:39:31,590
Yes.

1152
00:39:32,750 --> 00:39:33,360
Oh, there it is.

1153
00:39:33,620 --> 00:39:34,320
-Go ahead.
-Thank you.

1154
00:39:34,520 --> 00:39:35,190
Hello.

1155
00:39:35,220 --> 00:39:36,590
-I'll leave this for now.
-Are we doing more impersonations?

1156
00:39:36,830 --> 00:39:39,160
Are you guys still doing that?!

1157
00:39:39,360 --> 00:39:41,600
I mean, there's still tons of names left...

1158
00:39:41,830 --> 00:39:44,670
But these take such a long time.
Give it a go.

1159
00:39:45,300 --> 00:39:46,800
Here's the hint: He's a big senior in the industry.

1160
00:39:47,000 --> 00:39:47,240
Sure.

1161
00:39:48,900 --> 00:39:49,370
You see...

1162
00:39:49,970 --> 00:39:50,170
Huh?

1163
00:39:51,670 --> 00:39:52,540
I...

1164
00:39:53,740 --> 00:39:55,440
I know that you...

1165
00:39:56,910 --> 00:39:57,810
...are innocent.

1166
00:39:59,310 --> 00:40:01,180
So... Please...

1167
00:40:01,950 --> 00:40:05,320
Follow the letter of the law...

1168
00:40:06,820 --> 00:40:07,560
You knew immediately, didn't you?

1169
00:40:09,790 --> 00:40:10,530
You don't know?

1170
00:40:11,090 --> 00:40:12,360
You definitely have worked with this person.

1171
00:40:12,890 --> 00:40:14,300
And you as well, Shingo.

1172
00:40:15,100 --> 00:40:17,130
Anyway, he speaks really quietly.

1173
00:40:17,130 --> 00:40:17,630
Quietly, huh?
Anyway, he speaks really quietly.

1174
00:40:17,630 --> 00:40:18,170
Quietly, huh?

1175
00:40:19,700 --> 00:40:20,940
Does he walk on a limp?

1176
00:40:22,270 --> 00:40:23,200
-Not really...
-Is he your senior?

1177
00:40:23,200 --> 00:40:24,670
-On a limp?
-Of course, he's my senior too.

1178
00:40:24,970 --> 00:40:26,980
Can't we just stop it with these quizzes?

1179
00:40:27,140 --> 00:40:27,880
Stop?

1180
00:40:28,910 --> 00:40:31,910
You've been playing this guessing game this whole time!

1181
00:40:31,980 --> 00:40:32,580
You're right.

1182
00:40:32,710 --> 00:40:33,720
Why are you here all of a sudden?

1183
00:40:33,780 --> 00:40:37,250
I just wanted to have a little fun with everyone.

1184
00:40:37,250 --> 00:40:38,550
I just thought it'd be fun.

1185
00:40:38,550 --> 00:40:38,720
Yes.
I just thought it'd be fun.

1186
00:40:38,720 --> 00:40:39,520
Yes.

1187
00:40:39,520 --> 00:40:39,820
But how about we do something else?
Yes.

1188
00:40:39,820 --> 00:40:41,420
But how about we do something else?

1189
00:40:41,460 --> 00:40:42,390
-Sure.
-You're right.

1190
00:40:42,690 --> 00:40:44,390
How long are we gonna have this on?

1191
00:40:44,730 --> 00:40:45,090
Right?

1192
00:40:45,560 --> 00:40:46,360
Don't give me that.

1193
00:40:47,960 --> 00:40:48,560
Don't give me that.

1194
00:40:48,630 --> 00:40:49,930
Are you gonna eat it later or what?

1195
00:40:49,930 --> 00:40:51,030
I already ate.

1196
00:40:51,270 --> 00:40:52,300
I was watching, you know?

1197
00:40:53,600 --> 00:40:56,770
It's not like I'm here out of the blue.
I've been watching from behind the scenes.

1198
00:40:57,170 --> 00:40:58,740
I'll keep it on if you're gonna eat again.

1199
00:40:58,840 --> 00:40:59,570
I'll turn it off.

1200
00:41:00,680 --> 00:41:01,580
-You'll turn it off?
-Yes.

1201
00:41:01,840 --> 00:41:02,710
But it's still on.

1202
00:41:02,710 --> 00:41:03,810
He just closed it.

1203
00:41:03,810 --> 00:41:04,350
Oh really?

1204
00:41:04,350 --> 00:41:04,850
Yes.

1205
00:41:06,480 --> 00:41:07,780
How about you have one?

1206
00:41:10,450 --> 00:41:11,350
He's very good with hot food.

1207
00:41:12,720 --> 00:41:14,420
Oyakata can handle hot food.

1208
00:41:14,420 --> 00:41:14,660
He's very tough.
Oyakata can handle hot food.

1209
00:41:14,660 --> 00:41:15,390
He's very tough.

1210
00:41:17,390 --> 00:41:18,960
-Konnyaku...
-He's going for the konnyaku?

1211
00:41:19,060 --> 00:41:19,760
Konnyaku...

1212
00:41:23,630 --> 00:41:24,330
Seriously?

1213
00:41:28,140 --> 00:41:29,600
Are you really fine?

1214
00:41:30,770 --> 00:41:31,570
For real?

1215
00:41:32,440 --> 00:41:33,170
Yeah...

1216
00:41:33,580 --> 00:41:34,380
Isn't it hot?

1217
00:41:35,640 --> 00:41:37,010
But it looks like you're in pain.

1218
00:41:39,080 --> 00:41:39,410
Delicious.

1219
00:41:40,420 --> 00:41:41,280
-Is it?
-Yes.

1220
00:41:42,980 --> 00:41:44,590
Maybe it's not that hot...

1221
00:41:46,020 --> 00:41:46,650
How about you try some?

1222
00:41:47,560 --> 00:41:48,690
I'm fine!

1223
00:41:49,590 --> 00:41:50,830
Why would I do it?

1224
00:41:51,990 --> 00:41:54,400
We've already established that it's hot.

1225
00:41:54,400 --> 00:41:56,970
Look at all this steam, of course it's hot!

1226
00:41:57,430 --> 00:41:58,330
The lid is hot!

1227
00:42:02,670 --> 00:42:03,270
Which one?

1228
00:42:03,510 --> 00:42:04,710
-This is bad for Goto.
-Go for the radish.

1229
00:42:04,710 --> 00:42:05,110
Right?

1230
00:42:05,110 --> 00:42:06,780
The radish is impossible!

1231
00:42:08,710 --> 00:42:09,710
Don't force yourself.

1232
00:42:09,710 --> 00:42:10,710
I'm feeding myself?!

1233
00:42:10,810 --> 00:42:12,280
You guys aren't gonna make me eat it?

1234
00:42:13,980 --> 00:42:15,180
It's damn hot!

1235
00:42:15,280 --> 00:42:16,450
How can you eat that?!

1236
00:42:18,450 --> 00:42:19,520
He's amazing.

1237
00:42:19,620 --> 00:42:20,260
It's not hot.

1238
00:42:20,820 --> 00:42:21,760
It's not hot?!

1239
00:42:21,820 --> 00:42:23,090
It's scalding hot!

1240
00:42:23,090 --> 00:42:24,230
Look, I'll eat another one.

1241
00:42:25,290 --> 00:42:25,960
Hot!

1242
00:42:32,500 --> 00:42:33,700
This is crazy!

1243
00:42:33,700 --> 00:42:36,500
How can you eat this?!
And how'd you manage to eat the egg?!

1244
00:42:36,500 --> 00:42:38,210
That was something else.

1245
00:42:38,270 --> 00:42:40,340
I wouldn't have expected less from you, Goto.

1246
00:42:40,640 --> 00:42:43,510
It was way too hot, I couldn't even give an appropriate reaction.

1247
00:42:44,110 --> 00:42:45,810
That was so hot!

1248
00:42:46,180 --> 00:42:46,880
Shall I go next?

1249
00:42:47,380 --> 00:42:48,480
You showed us some great reactions.

1250
00:42:48,780 --> 00:42:50,450
-You're doing it?
-Yes.

1251
00:42:52,620 --> 00:42:54,020
The egg is super hot.

1252
00:42:54,120 --> 00:42:55,360
Eggs are super hot.

1253
00:42:55,920 --> 00:42:56,590
Egg...

1254
00:42:59,160 --> 00:43:01,360
You just got a hole-in-one into that cup...

1255
00:43:01,400 --> 00:43:03,130
-You just got a cup-in-one!
-A cup-in-one!

1256
00:43:03,430 --> 00:43:04,330
That was close.

1257
00:43:05,500 --> 00:43:06,530
Not at all...

1258
00:43:07,500 --> 00:43:09,070
Wasn't that hot?
Are you okay?!

1259
00:43:09,170 --> 00:43:09,770
It was fine.

1260
00:43:09,970 --> 00:43:11,070
-No one's laughing.
-I'm fine.

1261
00:43:11,370 --> 00:43:14,540
I think all of them are kind of smirking but...

1262
00:43:14,680 --> 00:43:15,440
It's hot, isn't it?

1263
00:43:15,610 --> 00:43:16,540
Of course.

1264
00:43:16,810 --> 00:43:17,110
Huh?

1265
00:43:17,610 --> 00:43:19,480
-You have to go for the egg next.
-The egg?

1266
00:43:19,680 --> 00:43:20,880
Yes, the egg.

1267
00:43:21,280 --> 00:43:21,780
It smells good.

1268
00:43:22,450 --> 00:43:22,950
Ready?

1269
00:43:22,950 --> 00:43:23,550
Yes.

1270
00:43:23,750 --> 00:43:25,620
This is bad...

1271
00:43:26,520 --> 00:43:27,620
What? In one bite?

1272
00:43:27,620 --> 00:43:28,320
He's not even flinching.
What? In one bite?

1273
00:43:28,320 --> 00:43:29,190
He's not even flinching.

1274
00:43:29,190 --> 00:43:29,790
Crazy.

1275
00:43:29,790 --> 00:43:31,030
That's amazing.

1276
00:43:31,890 --> 00:43:32,590
Looks so hot!

1277
00:43:32,590 --> 00:43:32,790
You're trying so hard to keep the poker face!
Looks so hot!

1278
00:43:32,790 --> 00:43:33,960
You're trying so hard to keep the poker face!

1279
00:43:34,700 --> 00:43:35,400
-No...
-Poker face?

1280
00:43:36,760 --> 00:43:37,470
I mean...

1281
00:43:38,530 --> 00:43:40,100
You've got a river running through your nose!

1282
00:43:43,270 --> 00:43:43,610
Delicious.

1283
00:43:44,770 --> 00:43:45,410
Is it?

1284
00:43:46,140 --> 00:43:47,980
I have seen that expression in one of his press conferences.

1285
00:43:47,980 --> 00:43:48,380
Really?

1286
00:43:48,540 --> 00:43:48,810
Yes.

1287
00:43:50,110 --> 00:43:50,650
Delicious.

1288
00:43:55,980 --> 00:43:56,750
That's amazing.

1289
00:43:56,850 --> 00:43:58,250
That's really something else.

1290
00:43:58,550 --> 00:43:59,420
It really is.

1291
00:44:00,220 --> 00:44:01,860
But going like this...

1292
00:44:02,690 --> 00:44:04,730
That was a very nice reaction, Suzuki.

1293
00:44:04,830 --> 00:44:05,390
Suzuki?

1294
00:44:05,490 --> 00:44:06,560
Who's Suzuki?

1295
00:44:08,360 --> 00:44:09,530
"Who's Suzuki?"

1296
00:44:09,530 --> 00:44:11,130
I ain't Suzuki, you know?

1297
00:44:11,130 --> 00:44:12,400
Suzuki!

1298
00:44:12,900 --> 00:44:14,840
I mean, you didn't introduce yourself.
I apologize.

1299
00:44:15,670 --> 00:44:16,100
Who?

1300
00:44:16,170 --> 00:44:17,810
Don't you know who I am?!

1301
00:44:18,310 --> 00:44:20,040
We've worked together plenty of times, haven't we?!

1302
00:44:21,140 --> 00:44:22,110
Who do you think I am?

1303
00:44:22,910 --> 00:44:23,510
Suzuki...

1304
00:44:23,510 --> 00:44:24,250
Suzuki?

1305
00:44:27,220 --> 00:44:29,050
How about you? We used to be regulars on that show, didn't we?

1306
00:44:29,150 --> 00:44:29,950
Yes...

1307
00:44:30,050 --> 00:44:30,950
You know my name, right?

1308
00:44:31,650 --> 00:44:35,060
-I mean, we were wondering when Suzuki would make an appearance.
-You're Suzuki, right?

1309
00:44:35,260 --> 00:44:35,890
That's not it?

1310
00:44:35,890 --> 00:44:37,030
-He's not Suzuki?
-I'm not Suzuki!

1311
00:44:37,090 --> 00:44:37,590
Kubota?

1312
00:44:37,590 --> 00:44:38,590
I'm not Kubota.

1313
00:44:41,460 --> 00:44:42,530
He's from Toro Salmon.

1314
00:44:43,060 --> 00:44:44,430
Oh, right...

1315
00:44:48,900 --> 00:44:50,710
Musaka, what are you digging into your nails for?

1316
00:44:50,710 --> 00:44:51,310
Sorry, I've just had this callus for the longest time.
Musaka, what are you digging into your nails for?

1317
00:44:51,310 --> 00:44:53,240
Sorry, I've just had this callus for the longest time.

1318
00:44:53,340 --> 00:44:54,140
He's Uchida.

1319
00:44:54,340 --> 00:44:55,240
Uchida, huh?

1320
00:44:55,540 --> 00:44:57,810
No, no... Who cares about all that?

1321
00:44:58,650 --> 00:44:59,580
Let's try that!

1322
00:45:00,220 --> 00:45:01,680
A little test of courage.

1323
00:45:01,980 --> 00:45:03,080
-Sure.
-Test of courage?

1324
00:45:03,950 --> 00:45:05,190
Test of courage?

1325
00:45:06,050 --> 00:45:06,720
Baseball butt spanking.

1326
00:45:06,720 --> 00:45:07,160
What?!

1327
00:45:07,620 --> 00:45:08,890
Whoa, I can't do that.

1328
00:45:09,390 --> 00:45:10,290
Let's spank some butts!

1329
00:45:10,290 --> 00:45:10,730
Can't do it?

1330
00:45:10,730 --> 00:45:11,330
No way...

1331
00:45:11,390 --> 00:45:12,960
Why are we doing it?

1332
00:45:13,190 --> 00:45:14,360
What's the point of this?

1333
00:45:14,360 --> 00:45:17,030
-I mean, we're just trying to find out who can take the most hits.
-No warning hits?

1334
00:45:17,230 --> 00:45:18,070
Yes, no warning.

1335
00:45:18,670 --> 00:45:19,900
-Alright, I'll go first.
-Would bare butts be better?

1336
00:45:20,440 --> 00:45:20,900
You're going?

1337
00:45:20,940 --> 00:45:22,040
I'm used to this kind of thing.

1338
00:45:22,300 --> 00:45:22,900
You are?

1339
00:45:23,000 --> 00:45:24,010
-He was in the baseball club.
-Let's do it.

1340
00:45:24,170 --> 00:45:25,370
I mean, I'm not 'used' to it per se...

1341
00:45:25,370 --> 00:45:26,840
I don't think they do that in normal baseball clubs...

1342
00:45:26,840 --> 00:45:27,140
Hiro, let's go.
I don't think they do that in normal baseball clubs...

1343
00:45:27,140 --> 00:45:27,940
Hiro, let's go.

1344
00:45:28,540 --> 00:45:28,740
What?!

1345
00:45:29,140 --> 00:45:30,110
-Me?
-Yes.

1346
00:45:31,350 --> 00:45:31,710
What?!

1347
00:45:32,680 --> 00:45:33,580
But everyone's my senior here...

1348
00:45:33,580 --> 00:45:35,180
-Is that how it's gonna be?
-Hit him as hard as you can.

1349
00:45:36,150 --> 00:45:37,650
For real? For real?

1350
00:45:38,390 --> 00:45:40,260
Is the hitter gonna rotate, or what?

1351
00:45:40,260 --> 00:45:41,720
There's no need to.

1352
00:45:41,720 --> 00:45:42,520
But he's my senior...

1353
00:45:43,190 --> 00:45:45,230
This way is better.

1354
00:45:45,330 --> 00:45:46,560
Should I ramp up the force?

1355
00:45:47,260 --> 00:45:49,660
-Sure.
-Alright then, I'll start gently first.

1356
00:45:53,230 --> 00:45:54,000
I can still go.

1357
00:45:54,300 --> 00:45:55,040
With ease!

1358
00:45:55,500 --> 00:45:56,300
Piece of cake.

1359
00:45:56,300 --> 00:45:56,670
That was pretty hard...

1360
00:45:56,670 --> 00:45:57,210
But wait...
That was pretty hard...

1361
00:45:57,210 --> 00:45:57,410
That was pretty hard...

1362
00:45:58,210 --> 00:46:00,540
Can I really go harder?

1363
00:46:00,540 --> 00:46:00,980
He'll be fine.
Can I really go harder?

1364
00:46:00,980 --> 00:46:02,340
He'll be fine.

1365
00:46:02,940 --> 00:46:03,310
I see.

1366
00:46:04,110 --> 00:46:05,510
-Alright, here I go.
-Sure.

1367
00:46:09,250 --> 00:46:11,150
-I can keep going.
-That was nothing.

1368
00:46:11,250 --> 00:46:11,890
-A bit harder?
-Yes.

1369
00:46:11,990 --> 00:46:12,620
Here I come.

1370
00:46:14,120 --> 00:46:16,990
Ouch!!

1371
00:46:20,700 --> 00:46:21,400
They're not laughing.

1372
00:46:21,460 --> 00:46:22,430
Did anyone laugh?

1373
00:46:22,430 --> 00:46:23,060
That must have hurt.
Did anyone laugh?

1374
00:46:23,060 --> 00:46:23,430
That must have hurt.

1375
00:46:23,430 --> 00:46:23,770
Did Musaka crack up a little bit?
That must have hurt.

1376
00:46:23,770 --> 00:46:24,830
Did Musaka crack up a little bit?

1377
00:46:24,930 --> 00:46:26,200
Just a little bit.

1378
00:46:26,630 --> 00:46:27,300
Kamiji too.

1379
00:46:27,500 --> 00:46:28,600
-Kamiji as well?
-Yes.

1380
00:46:28,700 --> 00:46:30,170
-Kamiji too.
-He tried his best.

1381
00:46:30,410 --> 00:46:31,770
That hurts!

1382
00:46:32,940 --> 00:46:33,640
Alright then...

1383
00:46:34,740 --> 00:46:36,810
I have nothing but my guts so...

1384
00:46:36,810 --> 00:46:37,550
Are you serious?
I have nothing but my guts so...

1385
00:46:37,550 --> 00:46:37,710
Are you serious?

1386
00:46:37,710 --> 00:46:38,110
I'm glad I worked this hard!
Are you serious?

1387
00:46:38,110 --> 00:46:38,910
I'm glad I worked this hard!

1388
00:46:39,880 --> 00:46:40,280
He volunteered.

1389
00:46:40,280 --> 00:46:40,880
He's a musician... He's my senior in the industry...
He volunteered.

1390
00:46:40,880 --> 00:46:42,350
He's a musician... He's my senior in the industry...

1391
00:46:42,380 --> 00:46:43,750
That's right, he is!

1392
00:46:44,150 --> 00:46:44,750
Don't hold back.

1393
00:46:44,850 --> 00:46:45,620
For real?

1394
00:46:45,620 --> 00:46:46,350
-Yes.
-Go ahead.

1395
00:46:48,820 --> 00:46:49,490
Here I go.

1396
00:46:52,790 --> 00:46:53,360
Ouch!

1397
00:46:55,830 --> 00:46:56,830
Must've hurt!

1398
00:46:59,400 --> 00:46:59,930
That was bad.

1399
00:47:03,000 --> 00:47:03,870
Are you alright?!

1400
00:47:03,910 --> 00:47:04,670
I'm fine.

1401
00:47:05,070 --> 00:47:05,840
Is it sore?

1402
00:47:06,540 --> 00:47:07,880
Alright, I'll go next.

1403
00:47:08,280 --> 00:47:09,110
Alright, let's try!

1404
00:47:09,110 --> 00:47:09,710
Hold on, can someone swap with me please?
Alright, let's try!

1405
00:47:09,710 --> 00:47:11,210
Hold on, can someone swap with me please?

1406
00:47:11,310 --> 00:47:12,880
-It's fine, just do it.
-Seriously?

1407
00:47:14,620 --> 00:47:15,120
Katsu.

1408
00:47:15,950 --> 00:47:16,450
Right?

1409
00:47:18,750 --> 00:47:19,820
It hurts when I sit.

1410
00:47:20,360 --> 00:47:25,760
It's really bad if he gets you in the thigh.

1411
00:47:26,390 --> 00:47:27,660
I'll go right around here, okay?

1412
00:47:27,660 --> 00:47:28,760
-The thigh...
-The thigh must hurt.

1413
00:47:30,770 --> 00:47:31,270
Hold on...

1414
00:47:32,530 --> 00:47:33,230
Oh no...

1415
00:47:34,600 --> 00:47:35,300
You just laughed.

1416
00:47:35,300 --> 00:47:35,640
He laughed.
You just laughed.

1417
00:47:35,640 --> 00:47:35,970
He laughed.

1418
00:47:37,070 --> 00:47:37,610
He laughed.

1419
00:47:39,870 --> 00:47:40,440
He did?

1420
00:47:41,580 --> 00:47:43,340
Yes, Katsunori just laughed.

1421
00:47:43,340 --> 00:47:43,710
-He just let out the most casual chuckle ever!
-He sure did!
Yes, Katsunori just laughed.

1422
00:47:43,710 --> 00:47:45,550
-He just let out the most casual chuckle ever!
-He sure did!

1423
00:47:47,480 --> 00:47:48,780
It was so casual!

1424
00:47:48,780 --> 00:47:49,280
But why?!
It was so casual!

1425
00:47:49,280 --> 00:47:49,750
But why?!

1426
00:47:50,350 --> 00:47:51,350
No way!

1427
00:47:51,650 --> 00:47:53,420
He was so relaxed.

1428
00:47:54,320 --> 00:47:55,460
What a chuckle!

1429
00:47:55,990 --> 00:47:56,590
Right...

1430
00:47:57,230 --> 00:47:59,360
You just laughed as if we were on a break!

1431
00:48:01,460 --> 00:48:02,530
What are you doing?!

1432
00:48:03,230 --> 00:48:04,130
That gave me a shock.

1433
00:48:04,130 --> 00:48:05,630
There was nothing going on!

1434
00:48:06,000 --> 00:48:06,400
Yeah...

1435
00:48:06,530 --> 00:48:07,200
It was so sudden.

1436
00:48:07,200 --> 00:48:09,300
He was having so much fun for some reason.

1437
00:48:09,400 --> 00:48:11,070
I see, the whole atmosphere made him laugh?

1438
00:48:11,070 --> 00:48:11,470
I just have this desire to please people.

1440
00:48:15,640 --> 00:48:16,710
Can we have a look at the replay?

1441
00:48:16,710 --> 00:48:17,810
-Yes.
-Let's go.

1442
00:48:18,710 --> 00:48:20,780
Katsu, you're something else.

1443
00:48:23,050 --> 00:48:24,190
I'll go right around here, okay?

1444
00:48:24,450 --> 00:48:25,050
Ready?

1445
00:48:27,420 --> 00:48:27,920
Hold on...

1446
00:48:31,190 --> 00:48:32,330
He laughed!

1447
00:48:34,600 --> 00:48:35,660
They even startled him with the alarm!

1448
00:48:36,930 --> 00:48:38,530
Is this your third card?

1449
00:48:38,770 --> 00:48:39,430
Yes it is.

1450
00:48:39,500 --> 00:48:40,500
What?!

1451
00:48:41,200 --> 00:48:43,370
Katsunori Takahashi... Red card!

1452
00:48:43,910 --> 00:48:45,370
-The first one?!
-There it is!!

1453
00:48:46,270 --> 00:48:46,870
Damn it!!

1454
00:48:46,870 --> 00:48:47,380
Our first dropout.
Damn it!!

1455
00:48:47,380 --> 00:48:48,280
Our first dropout.

1456
00:48:53,380 --> 00:48:54,320
Are you for real?!

1457
00:48:54,880 --> 00:48:55,280
See you guys.

1458
00:48:56,150 --> 00:48:57,850
-Thank you!
-Good work today!

1459
00:48:58,490 --> 00:48:59,720
I was super frustrated with myself.

1460
00:49:01,820 --> 00:49:03,690
What happened to you?

1461
00:49:04,190 --> 00:49:07,860
Well, first of all, there were no comedians this time around...

1462
00:49:08,660 --> 00:49:10,570
So the tempo was incredibly slow.

1463
00:49:10,930 --> 00:49:11,830
Not much was going on.

1464
00:49:12,530 --> 00:49:15,600
So, I wanted to play this russian roulette-inspired game.

1465
00:49:15,900 --> 00:49:18,810
...so I was desperate to do something.

1466
00:49:19,270 --> 00:49:21,740
I mean, I didn't know if they would find it funny.

1467
00:49:22,540 --> 00:49:23,810
But I just thought I had to be proactive.

1468
00:49:29,680 --> 00:49:30,280
They’re kissing.

1469
00:49:35,460 --> 00:49:36,890
And I just ended up laughing unintentionally.

1470
00:49:37,490 --> 00:49:38,390
All of them were unintentional.

1471
00:49:39,560 --> 00:49:40,360
All of them.

1472
00:49:41,600 --> 00:49:43,730
I'll turn you into minced meat!

1473
00:49:44,530 --> 00:49:47,130
"Now, I will ask all of you to kill each other"
