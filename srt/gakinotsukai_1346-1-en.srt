The First Gaki No Tsukai Arahende Thorough Search Project!
Let's stroll around town until we find a celebrity!!

4
00:00:06,180 --> 00:00:08,300
Azabujuban Edition!

5
00:00:08,710 --> 00:00:09,270
Thank you for having us!

6
00:00:09,310 --> 00:00:10,620
That was quite the voice you made.

7
00:00:12,480 --> 00:00:14,150
People gather around if I talk out loud, and it's annoying.

8
00:00:15,840 --> 00:00:16,620
Annoying?

9
00:00:16,830 --> 00:00:17,880
I mean, all the normal people.

10
00:00:17,900 --> 00:00:19,090
Oh, right.

11
00:00:19,130 --> 00:00:21,350
But it sure has been a while since last time, hasn't it?

12
00:00:21,350 --> 00:00:23,210
That's right, it's been a while.

13
00:00:23,770 --> 00:00:24,450
Is this the 7th time?

14
00:00:24,490 --> 00:00:25,340
Yes it is.

15
00:00:25,370 --> 00:00:28,550
The last celebrity we encountered was Yoshi from COWCOW.

16
00:00:30,830 --> 00:00:31,630
In Shimokitazawa, right?

17
00:00:31,780 --> 00:00:32,560
Right, in Shimokitazawa!

18
00:00:32,560 --> 00:00:33,360
It was Shimokitazawa.

19
00:00:33,480 --> 00:00:36,780
I still have no idea where he was going.

20
00:00:37,530 --> 00:00:39,200
He might have been returning from another place.

21
00:00:39,200 --> 00:00:40,580
He might have been returning from somewhere.
He might have been returning from another place.

22
00:00:40,580 --> 00:00:41,660
He might have been returning from another place.

23
00:00:41,660 --> 00:00:42,570
We'll never know.

24
00:00:45,150 --> 00:00:51,660
This is the seventh iteration of this program, where the guys aren't allowed to go home until they find a celebrity!

25
00:00:53,330 --> 00:00:59,630
They have wandered and struggled to find all their celebrities!

26
00:01:12,370 --> 00:01:15,390
And this time around, the guys are looking in this area.

27
00:01:16,570 --> 00:01:18,930
Azabujuban in Minato Ward!

28
00:01:20,320 --> 00:01:22,850
A town with a good atmosphere with countless famous shops lining the streets.

29
00:01:23,100 --> 00:01:27,300
Overflowing with tourists, it is one of the capital's most popular spots!

30
00:01:28,330 --> 00:01:33,960
Many celebrities wander these streets unnoticed, but will the guys be able to find them?

31
00:01:34,680 --> 00:01:36,300
We're in Azabujuban today

32
00:01:36,370 --> 00:01:38,970
There's not a lot of people here at this hour...

33
00:01:38,970 --> 00:01:39,450
I don't know, I think we'll finish fairly quickly today.
There's not a lot of people here at this hour...

34
00:01:39,450 --> 00:01:42,070
I don't know, I think we'll finish fairly quickly today.

35
00:01:42,100 --> 00:01:43,200
There's tons of famous people in Juban, right?

36
00:01:43,200 --> 00:01:43,590
There really is.
We just have to go over there.
There's tons of famous people in Juban, right?

37
00:01:43,590 --> 00:01:46,680
There really is.
We just have to go over there.

38
00:01:46,680 --> 00:01:47,010
Really?
There really is.
We just have to go over there.

39
00:01:47,010 --> 00:01:47,510
Really?

40
00:01:48,270 --> 00:01:50,060
But this timing is a bit...

41
00:01:50,060 --> 00:01:52,270
I also dressed a bit lighter today...

42
00:01:52,320 --> 00:01:53,670
So we have to make it a quick one.

43
00:01:53,830 --> 00:01:55,280
Tanaka has it worse though.

44
00:01:56,100 --> 00:01:57,720
Are you one of the Kano sisters?!

45
00:01:57,870 --> 00:01:58,870
What's up with that outfit?!

46
00:01:59,950 --> 00:02:00,590
What happened?

47
00:02:00,730 --> 00:02:02,680
This guy's got no sense of the seasons.

48
00:02:02,820 --> 00:02:03,800
I'm wearing something underneath!

49
00:02:03,800 --> 00:02:04,290
It's so thin though...
I'm wearing something underneath!

50
00:02:04,290 --> 00:02:04,700
It's so thin though...

51
00:02:04,700 --> 00:02:05,590
You've gotta be freezing!

52
00:02:05,960 --> 00:02:06,670
And what's that pattern?

53
00:02:07,120 --> 00:02:08,560
It's a bird print.

54
00:02:08,600 --> 00:02:09,300
-Birds?
-Yes.

55
00:02:09,330 --> 00:02:11,290
That's so intricate!

56
00:02:11,670 --> 00:02:13,180
It's over the top!

57
00:02:13,180 --> 00:02:13,190
(鳥がらスープ 'Tori Gara Su-pu' = Chicken soup, sounds the same as 鳥柄 'Tori Gara' = bird pattern/bird print)

58
00:02:13,190 --> 00:02:14,160
It's like chicken soup!
(鳥がらスープ 'Tori Gara Su-pu' = Chicken soup, sounds the same as 鳥柄 'Tori Gara' = bird pattern/bird print)

59
00:02:14,160 --> 00:02:15,400
Totally.
(鳥がらスープ 'Tori Gara Su-pu' = Chicken soup, sounds the same as 鳥柄 'Tori Gara' = bird pattern/bird print)

60
00:02:15,450 --> 00:02:16,470
Intricate indeed.

61
00:02:17,130 --> 00:02:21,200
Let's stroll around until we find a celebrity!
Azabujuban Edition!

62
00:02:22,040 --> 00:02:22,970
These are the rules:

63
00:02:23,170 --> 00:02:26,670
The shoot won't end until we meet a celebrity.

64
00:02:27,650 --> 00:02:32,770
However, all members must know the celebrity's name.

65
00:02:33,600 --> 00:02:36,600
And naturally, we also need filming consent from their respective agencies.

66
00:02:37,030 --> 00:02:41,900
Now, will the guys find any celebrities in Azabujuban?!

67
00:02:42,430 --> 00:02:44,410
If we find someone now, we're done?

68
00:02:44,410 --> 00:02:45,540
That's right.

69
00:02:46,130 --> 00:02:47,920
But they might not be allowed to appear on the show.

70
00:02:47,920 --> 00:02:48,230
Yes!

71
00:02:48,270 --> 00:02:52,210
But you know, we've found too many comedians at this point.

72
00:02:52,470 --> 00:02:55,700
So I'd like to find someone that's not in comedy this time.

73
00:02:55,700 --> 00:02:55,710
Right.
So I'd like to find someone that's not in comedy this time.

74
00:02:55,710 --> 00:02:56,390
Right.

75
00:02:56,390 --> 00:02:57,820
It would be nice.

76
00:02:57,880 --> 00:03:02,030
And also, the viewers might think we've somehow set this all up if comedians keep appearing.

77
00:03:02,030 --> 00:03:02,710
Totally.

78
00:03:02,730 --> 00:03:04,240
We want the element of surprise.

79
00:03:04,270 --> 00:03:06,830
Right, someone you'd never expect to see in Gaki.

80
00:03:06,830 --> 00:03:07,080
That would be nice.
Right, someone you'd never expect to see in Gaki.

81
00:03:07,080 --> 00:03:07,670
That would be nice.

82
00:03:07,670 --> 00:03:07,970
Yeah.

83
00:03:08,280 --> 00:03:08,960
Well, yeah...

84
00:03:09,390 --> 00:03:10,730
But we still have to find them.

85
00:03:12,470 --> 00:03:12,970
You're right.

86
00:03:13,470 --> 00:03:20,100
I actually spend a ton of time here.

87
00:03:20,320 --> 00:03:22,550
So getting spotted through this kind of show in my private time would be my worst nightmare.

88
00:03:23,970 --> 00:03:25,230
-Right?
-I would be livid!

89
00:03:26,380 --> 00:03:26,430
In your private time, right?

90
00:03:26,430 --> 00:03:27,800
I'd be like: "How dare you film me in my private time?!".
In your private time, right?

91
00:03:27,800 --> 00:03:29,950
I'd be like: "How dare you film me in my private time?!".

92
00:03:30,100 --> 00:03:31,730
"What station are you with?!"

93
00:03:32,230 --> 00:03:34,090
And that's what we're about to do right now.

94
00:03:35,550 --> 00:03:37,730
The clock reads 2:31!

95
00:03:38,220 --> 00:03:41,500
And the search has started on this cold, 5 degree weather.

96
00:03:41,900 --> 00:03:45,500
-I've never been to Juban at this hour.
-Right, me either.

97
00:03:45,770 --> 00:03:54,010
You're right, I don't think there's many celebrities at this around.

98
00:03:54,530 --> 00:03:56,030
I wanna make this a quick one...

99
00:03:56,030 --> 00:03:58,640
I think I can say this since it's well known information...

100
00:03:58,670 --> 00:04:00,970
But Mr. Shimura hangs around here all the time.
(Yasunori Shimura, aka Ken Shimura)

101
00:04:01,060 --> 00:04:03,400
But it's always at night, right?

102
00:04:03,400 --> 00:04:03,650
That's right.
But it's always at night, right?

103
00:04:03,650 --> 00:04:04,170
That's right.

104
00:04:05,050 --> 00:04:07,780
We'd find him in no time if we stood in front of a Girls Bar. (Hostess bar)

105
00:04:07,950 --> 00:04:10,900
That's right, he mentioned he was a regular in this area while we were filming another show.

106
00:04:10,900 --> 00:04:12,630
Does he come here for the Girls Bars?

107
00:04:13,300 --> 00:04:15,280
And he even goes to places in plain sight!
With big glass windows!

108
00:04:15,280 --> 00:04:16,040
Yeah, you can see him right from the outside.
And he even goes to places in plain sight!
With big glass windows!

109
00:04:16,040 --> 00:04:17,620
Yeah, you can see him right from the outside.

110
00:04:18,840 --> 00:04:19,700
That's crazy.

111
00:04:19,700 --> 00:04:19,980
And I even asked him if he should say that...
He replied: "It's fine".
That's crazy.

112
00:04:19,980 --> 00:04:22,210
And I even asked him if he should say that...
He replied: "It's fine".

113
00:04:23,170 --> 00:04:25,740
His bald spot was clear as day from the street!

114
00:04:34,330 --> 00:04:34,710
What?

115
00:04:37,200 --> 00:04:37,720
-Look! Look!
-Who?

116
00:04:39,720 --> 00:04:44,100
Let's stroll around Tokyo until we find a celebrity!

117
00:04:44,250 --> 00:04:45,830
Azabujuban Edition!

118
00:04:46,810 --> 00:04:48,920
Will the guys find them?!

119
00:04:49,200 --> 00:04:52,600
First off, the guys are walking down Patio street towards the train station.

120
00:04:53,130 --> 00:04:56,540
Matsumoto, where do people go at this hour?

121
00:04:56,710 --> 00:05:00,600
At this hour? I don't really know...

122
00:05:01,400 --> 00:05:04,040
But I heard Junichi Ishida is spotted around here regularly.

123
00:05:04,070 --> 00:05:05,850
Mr. Ishida?
That's be nice!

124
00:05:06,160 --> 00:05:08,830
And there's a ton of tourists too.

125
00:05:08,830 --> 00:05:08,950
But we need someone we can name.
And there's a ton of tourists too.

126
00:05:08,950 --> 00:05:10,690
But we need someone we can name.

127
00:05:11,930 --> 00:05:12,970
Alright then...

128
00:05:13,590 --> 00:05:15,640
I'm gonna start reaching out to people who look the part.

129
00:05:15,640 --> 00:05:16,650
Of course, go ahead.

130
00:05:16,670 --> 00:05:18,910
Look the part?

131
00:05:19,060 --> 00:05:19,650
Lookalikes?

132
00:05:19,730 --> 00:05:21,130
We've gotta find them.

133
00:05:21,770 --> 00:05:23,540
They're drinking wine at this hour?

134
00:05:23,770 --> 00:05:25,880
There's a ton of bottles too.

135
00:05:27,030 --> 00:05:29,860
They're having fun.

136
00:05:30,400 --> 00:05:33,330
-We'd better find someone wearing a mask.
-We should find someone in one of these cute stores.

137
00:05:34,310 --> 00:05:35,920
Right...

138
00:05:36,900 --> 00:05:38,220
Right, anyone with a mask...

139
00:05:38,300 --> 00:05:39,630
-Yeah.
-They are always wearing masks.

140
00:05:39,830 --> 00:05:40,830
They are.

141
00:05:41,050 --> 00:05:46,250
So Tanaka, you should get right in their faces and take the mask off.

142
00:05:47,850 --> 00:05:50,420
You just go up to them and take it right off.

143
00:05:50,440 --> 00:05:53,530
You'll freeze to death if it gets dark and we haven't found anyone!

144
00:05:54,000 --> 00:05:55,130
I have to work hard today.

145
00:05:55,500 --> 00:05:58,820
Of course, I would be against it from the get-go...

146
00:05:59,270 --> 00:05:59,810
But you know what to do.

147
00:06:00,210 --> 00:06:01,870
Tanaka, you have to sacrifice yourself.

148
00:06:02,490 --> 00:06:04,540
You have to go like: "It's fine" "Don't worry about it".

149
00:06:06,030 --> 00:06:07,140
"This much should be fine".

150
00:06:07,140 --> 00:06:08,530
"This is normal".

151
00:06:10,170 --> 00:06:14,470
Perhaps it is the time, but there are no signs of any celebrity around.

152
00:06:16,040 --> 00:06:16,500
It's deserted.

153
00:06:16,620 --> 00:06:17,330
There are no people here.

154
00:06:18,120 --> 00:06:20,310
We have to walk around first.

155
00:06:20,310 --> 00:06:20,860
Right, let's look around first and see what's on the down low.
We have to walk around first.

156
00:06:20,860 --> 00:06:22,400
Right, let's look around first and see what's on the down low.

157
00:06:22,530 --> 00:06:24,970
But it sure would be amazing if we found someone on our first walkthrough.

158
00:06:24,970 --> 00:06:25,490
It sure would.
But it sure would be amazing if we found someone on our first walkthrough.

159
00:06:25,490 --> 00:06:25,870
It sure would.

160
00:06:26,150 --> 00:06:28,020
I'm telling you, it's too early.

161
00:06:28,020 --> 00:06:30,010
Yeah, it's a problem.

162
00:06:31,050 --> 00:06:33,870
Yeah, nobody's around at this time.

163
00:06:34,740 --> 00:06:39,930
The guys are now heading down the main street where most of the people are!

164
00:06:40,930 --> 00:06:42,830
There's a lot of fancy people around here.

165
00:06:42,830 --> 00:06:43,670
Well, of course.
There's a lot of fancy people around here.

166
00:06:43,670 --> 00:06:44,840
Well, of course.

167
00:06:44,840 --> 00:06:45,120
-They all look like celebs.
-Totally.
Well, of course.

168
00:06:45,120 --> 00:06:46,470
-They all look like celebs.
-Totally.

169
00:06:46,690 --> 00:06:48,930
Tons of celebrities also live around here.

170
00:06:49,360 --> 00:06:51,630
-A lot of them live around here.
-This is one of their neighborhoods.

171
00:06:52,970 --> 00:06:54,490
We haven't spotted any potential celebs.

172
00:06:54,490 --> 00:06:54,890
Surprisingly...
We haven't spotted any potential celebs.

173
00:06:54,890 --> 00:06:55,330
Surprisingly...

174
00:06:56,070 --> 00:06:56,870
We might be in trouble.

175
00:06:56,870 --> 00:06:57,220
Yeah, this could get bad...
We might be in trouble.

176
00:06:57,220 --> 00:06:59,700
Yeah, this could get bad...

177
00:07:00,140 --> 00:07:01,640
Should we have a look in Starbucks?

178
00:07:02,630 --> 00:07:04,020
Starbucks sounds good.

179
00:07:06,080 --> 00:07:07,490
-What was that?
-What a reaction!

180
00:07:08,470 --> 00:07:10,080
That was an amazing reaction to Hamada.

181
00:07:13,170 --> 00:07:14,220
That was hilarious.

182
00:07:14,660 --> 00:07:15,110
Right?

183
00:07:16,570 --> 00:07:17,600
It's a Yakitori place.

184
00:07:17,730 --> 00:07:18,480
Yakitori.

185
00:07:19,230 --> 00:07:22,400
I'm gonna ask that girl with the glasses in front of Starbucks.

186
00:07:22,400 --> 00:07:22,870
Let's go.

187
00:07:23,370 --> 00:07:24,170
Hello...

188
00:07:24,900 --> 00:07:25,570
Hello...

189
00:07:26,020 --> 00:07:27,230
Are you a celebrity?

190
00:07:30,170 --> 00:07:31,710
Have you had any famous customers today?

191
00:07:31,710 --> 00:07:31,900
Was she not a celebrity?
Have you had any famous customers today?

192
00:07:31,900 --> 00:07:33,100
Was she not a celebrity?

193
00:07:33,170 --> 00:07:34,880
You get a lot of famous customers, don't you?

194
00:07:34,960 --> 00:07:35,200
Right?

195
00:07:35,490 --> 00:07:36,040
Oh really?

196
00:07:36,040 --> 00:07:36,360
Have you seen any around?
Oh really?

197
00:07:36,360 --> 00:07:36,670
Have you seen any around?

198
00:07:36,670 --> 00:07:36,970
I've also eaten here.
Have you seen any around?

199
00:07:36,970 --> 00:07:37,570
I've also eaten here.

200
00:07:37,570 --> 00:07:38,050
Oh, really?
I've also eaten here.

201
00:07:38,050 --> 00:07:38,290
Oh, really?

202
00:07:38,290 --> 00:07:39,340
Hiroyuki Yabe.

203
00:07:39,540 --> 00:07:40,440
Oh, Yabe!

204
00:07:40,890 --> 00:07:41,630
Miho Yabe.

205
00:07:42,640 --> 00:07:43,410
Miho Yabe?!

206
00:07:43,520 --> 00:07:44,080
Yabe?

207
00:07:45,600 --> 00:07:47,500
There's no point going over there...

208
00:07:47,500 --> 00:07:49,590
Over here?
Did you let someone get away?

209
00:07:49,830 --> 00:07:51,410
Did Miho Yabe escape?

210
00:07:51,420 --> 00:07:52,570
It wasn't Miho Yabe.

211
00:07:53,250 --> 00:07:55,190
There's too many people talking.

212
00:07:55,390 --> 00:07:59,560
She said Hiroyuki Yabe hangs around this part of town.

213
00:07:59,880 --> 00:08:00,940
Other than comedians?

214
00:08:03,130 --> 00:08:04,930
Like actresses?

215
00:08:05,830 --> 00:08:06,860
I've seen Haruka Igawa around.

216
00:08:06,860 --> 00:08:07,140
Haruka Igawa!
I've seen Haruka Igawa around.

217
00:08:07,140 --> 00:08:08,360
Haruka Igawa!

218
00:08:11,080 --> 00:08:11,630
Excuse us.

219
00:08:12,000 --> 00:08:12,930
Thank you!

220
00:08:13,830 --> 00:08:14,530
Let's go, bastards!

221
00:08:14,880 --> 00:08:16,600
-Come on, don't get mad!
-You're wasting time!

222
00:08:17,010 --> 00:08:19,400
We were just gathering some intel!

223
00:08:19,830 --> 00:08:21,700
We were asking about celebrity sightings.

224
00:08:22,150 --> 00:08:23,800
Matsumoto comes here regularly.

225
00:08:24,600 --> 00:08:26,970
He's eaten here before.

226
00:08:26,970 --> 00:08:27,150
Yeah, but it was just the one time.
He's eaten here before.

227
00:08:27,150 --> 00:08:29,020
Yeah, but it was just the one time.

228
00:08:29,360 --> 00:08:30,870
And they said they haven't had any famous customers today.

229
00:08:30,870 --> 00:08:31,130
We let one slip away...
And they said they haven't had any famous customers today.

230
00:08:31,130 --> 00:08:31,970
We let one slip away...

231
00:08:32,070 --> 00:08:33,400
She really looked famous.

232
00:08:33,400 --> 00:08:33,420
She must have been.
She really looked famous.

233
00:08:33,420 --> 00:08:33,800
She must have been.

234
00:08:33,800 --> 00:08:34,460
That girl with the sunglasses?
She must have been.

235
00:08:34,460 --> 00:08:34,840
That girl with the sunglasses?

236
00:08:34,840 --> 00:08:35,190
Yeah...
That girl with the sunglasses?

237
00:08:35,190 --> 00:08:35,600
Yeah...

238
00:08:35,640 --> 00:08:37,050
She just sneaked right past us.

239
00:08:37,050 --> 00:08:37,510
-Oh, really?
-Yes.
She just sneaked right past us.

240
00:08:37,510 --> 00:08:38,020
-Oh, really?
-Yes.

241
00:08:38,120 --> 00:08:39,390
But we wouldn't know her name anyway...

242
00:08:39,630 --> 00:08:40,800
Yeah, there's no way I'd know.

243
00:08:41,030 --> 00:08:42,360
She really could have been famous.

244
00:08:42,440 --> 00:08:43,880
But her name though...

245
00:08:45,810 --> 00:08:50,140
Alright, I'm starting to come down with a cold...
Time to go home...

246
00:08:50,770 --> 00:08:52,600
It's only been 12 minutes.

247
00:08:53,760 --> 00:08:54,610
Only 12 minutes have passed.

248
00:08:54,610 --> 00:08:54,940
We haven't even done one lap!
Only 12 minutes have passed.

249
00:08:54,940 --> 00:08:56,530
We haven't even done one lap!

250
00:08:57,130 --> 00:08:59,170
But I did mention I was coming down with a cold.

251
00:08:59,700 --> 00:09:00,510
Fight through it.

252
00:09:00,530 --> 00:09:02,840
What are we gonna do?
Someone should go into this Ishii.

253
00:09:03,960 --> 00:09:05,220
-Should I look inside?
-Yeah.

254
00:09:05,460 --> 00:09:05,840
Shall I?

255
00:09:05,840 --> 00:09:06,400
Oh, I think it could be worth looking at.
Shall I?

256
00:09:06,400 --> 00:09:07,210
Oh, I think it could be worth looking at.

257
00:09:07,210 --> 00:09:07,770
Go and have a look.
Oh, I think it could be worth looking at.

258
00:09:07,770 --> 00:09:09,000
Go and have a look.

259
00:09:09,710 --> 00:09:14,490
Cocorico goes into Seijo Ishii to look for potential celebrities!

260
00:09:14,700 --> 00:09:16,660
Why do we always send Tanaka?

261
00:09:17,930 --> 00:09:20,220
Is he gonna be alright?
He's got the worst eyes.

262
00:09:20,230 --> 00:09:21,100
It's Kokoriko.

263
00:09:21,180 --> 00:09:22,290
He's always missing the celebs.

264
00:09:22,350 --> 00:09:23,370
He's got a bad nose too.

265
00:09:26,940 --> 00:09:28,670
After a 5 minute wait...

266
00:09:30,790 --> 00:09:32,700
No luck.

267
00:09:33,380 --> 00:09:35,650
It's just time... You never know.

268
00:09:36,050 --> 00:09:37,600
We'll find someone after a few laps around.

269
00:09:38,100 --> 00:09:39,570
Let's keep this place in mind.

270
00:09:40,860 --> 00:09:43,900
But I can't smell that air of potential yet...

271
00:09:44,000 --> 00:09:44,830
Right...

272
00:09:45,240 --> 00:09:47,570
I keep thinking about the girl that got away...

273
00:09:49,250 --> 00:09:50,500
I wonder who she was...

274
00:09:50,870 --> 00:09:52,150
She was wearing sunglasses, right?

275
00:09:52,440 --> 00:09:53,730
She could have been someone...

276
00:09:53,730 --> 00:09:54,610
She really could have.

277
00:09:54,610 --> 00:09:55,940
This girl's got sunglasses too.

278
00:09:56,330 --> 00:09:57,370
This girl too...

279
00:09:58,700 --> 00:09:59,800
Let's ask.

280
00:09:59,930 --> 00:10:00,730
Go ahead.

281
00:10:01,120 --> 00:10:01,570
Excuse me.

282
00:10:02,300 --> 00:10:03,700
You're in the entertainment business, aren't you?

283
00:10:03,700 --> 00:10:04,110
I'm not.
You're in the entertainment business, aren't you?

284
00:10:04,110 --> 00:10:04,970
I'm not.

285
00:10:05,010 --> 00:10:05,980
Haven't you appeared in a commercial?

286
00:10:05,980 --> 00:10:06,240
I haven't.
Haven't you appeared in a commercial?

287
00:10:06,240 --> 00:10:06,440
I haven't.

288
00:10:06,440 --> 00:10:06,690
Oh, really?
I haven't.

289
00:10:06,690 --> 00:10:07,200
Oh, really?

290
00:10:07,610 --> 00:10:08,500
Thank you.

291
00:10:08,740 --> 00:10:08,800
Thanks.

292
00:10:08,800 --> 00:10:09,320
What's wrong with you?
Thanks.

293
00:10:09,320 --> 00:10:10,370
What's wrong with you?

294
00:10:10,840 --> 00:10:11,900
What's with the questions?

295
00:10:14,720 --> 00:10:17,120
The guys keep walking down Azabujuban's main street.

296
00:10:17,500 --> 00:10:19,470
When Endo finds something!

297
00:10:20,210 --> 00:10:21,770
There's some signatures over there.

298
00:10:21,810 --> 00:10:23,100
Autographs of famous people.

299
00:10:23,340 --> 00:10:24,910
You know who that is, right?

300
00:10:25,550 --> 00:10:26,400
Sho Aikawa?

301
00:10:26,660 --> 00:10:27,500
-Sho Aikawa?
-Hello.

302
00:10:27,810 --> 00:10:29,080
Isn't that Masaki Kyomot's signature?

303
00:10:29,300 --> 00:10:31,530
-Which one?
-On the top left.
-Hello.

304
00:10:31,530 --> 00:10:32,010
Hello.

305
00:10:32,390 --> 00:10:32,900
Really?

306
00:10:33,020 --> 00:10:34,020
-Who's this?
-It's not?

307
00:10:34,640 --> 00:10:35,750
This is Junji Takada's.

308
00:10:36,070 --> 00:10:37,800
You're totally off!

309
00:10:39,290 --> 00:10:40,560
What's with everyone today?

310
00:10:40,570 --> 00:10:41,940
And that's Satom Ishihara, right?
(Kuniko Ishigami, aka Satomi Ishihara)

311
00:10:41,940 --> 00:10:42,960
I can't tell.

312
00:10:42,960 --> 00:10:43,150
It's really difficult to read.
I can't tell.

313
00:10:43,150 --> 00:10:44,470
It's really difficult to read.

314
00:10:44,500 --> 00:10:45,070
They should write more neatly.

315
00:10:45,070 --> 00:10:45,670
Do you get a lot of famous customers?
They should write more neatly.

316
00:10:45,670 --> 00:10:46,530
Do you get a lot of famous customers?

317
00:10:46,650 --> 00:10:48,760
Well yes, from time to time.

318
00:10:48,800 --> 00:10:49,370
Right...

319
00:10:50,320 --> 00:10:51,370
Thank you.

320
00:10:54,870 --> 00:10:56,460
That looks super delicious.

321
00:10:56,460 --> 00:11:00,840
That's the Taiyaki shop from "Oyoge! Taiyaki!"
(Song by Masato Shimon)

322
00:11:01,670 --> 00:11:02,370
The original one?

323
00:11:02,470 --> 00:11:03,050
Of course.

324
00:11:03,070 --> 00:11:03,910
Really?

325
00:11:03,940 --> 00:11:06,430
The song is based on this store.

326
00:11:06,770 --> 00:11:07,640
That was here?!

327
00:11:08,170 --> 00:11:12,330
It's been 20 minutes and the guys haven't found any celebrities!

328
00:11:12,970 --> 00:11:13,400
Whoa!

329
00:11:13,760 --> 00:11:14,850
This place is empty.

330
00:11:18,030 --> 00:11:20,650
I think there'd be way more people if it were a little later in the day...

331
00:11:20,650 --> 00:11:21,020
By the way, Heipo lives in that building, right?
(Toshihide Saito, aka 'Heipo)
I think there'd be way more people if it were a little later in the day...

332
00:11:21,020 --> 00:11:23,240
By the way, Heipo lives in that building, right?
(Toshihide Saito, aka 'Heipo)

333
00:11:23,560 --> 00:11:24,230
Oh, really?

334
00:11:24,870 --> 00:11:26,900
Here, here.
I've seen him coming out of this building.

335
00:11:27,790 --> 00:11:28,400
Heipo!

336
00:11:28,400 --> 00:11:28,670
This one?
Heipo!

337
00:11:28,670 --> 00:11:28,800
This one?

338
00:11:29,880 --> 00:11:30,980
He can't hear you.

339
00:11:30,980 --> 00:11:31,160
It'd be so funny if he was home.
He can't hear you.

340
00:11:31,160 --> 00:11:32,280
It'd be so funny if he was home.

341
00:11:32,420 --> 00:11:33,630
He would've come out if he was home.

342
00:11:34,960 --> 00:11:38,100
I've also spotted Heipo twice in this Soba place.

343
00:11:39,580 --> 00:11:41,230
Is Heipo the only celeb you've seen around here?!

344
00:11:41,230 --> 00:11:42,210
I always run into him.

345
00:11:42,210 --> 00:11:42,430
You sure do.
I always run into him.

346
00:11:42,430 --> 00:11:43,370
You sure do.

347
00:11:43,570 --> 00:11:45,030
-He's a pretty small guy, but he stands out.
-Right?

348
00:11:45,030 --> 00:11:45,380
I don't really see him though...
-He's a pretty small guy, but he stands out.
-Right?

349
00:11:45,380 --> 00:11:47,480
I don't really see him though...

350
00:11:48,000 --> 00:11:48,830
Heipo!

351
00:11:50,330 --> 00:11:52,100
I'm telling you, he ain't here.

352
00:11:54,380 --> 00:11:59,830
Closing in on Roppongi Hills, the guys are just about to reach the end of Azabujuban.

353
00:12:01,210 --> 00:12:04,700
If this were anything like our previous searches, we would have found at least one celebrity by now.

354
00:12:04,700 --> 00:12:04,990
Totally.
If this were anything like our previous searches, we would have found at least one celebrity by now.

355
00:12:04,990 --> 00:12:05,180
Totally.

356
00:12:05,180 --> 00:12:05,400
A potential candidate, right?
Totally.

357
00:12:05,400 --> 00:12:06,200
A potential candidate, right?

358
00:12:06,400 --> 00:12:08,830
Someone not very well known.

359
00:12:08,830 --> 00:12:09,250
Yes, that's right.
Someone not very well known.

360
00:12:09,250 --> 00:12:09,660
Yes, that's right.

361
00:12:10,530 --> 00:12:12,740
What about this car?

362
00:12:12,950 --> 00:12:14,720
-That's a good car.
-This could be it.

363
00:12:14,820 --> 00:12:16,110
She totally looks like a celeb.

364
00:12:16,240 --> 00:12:18,250
-This might be it.
-You're right.

365
00:12:18,300 --> 00:12:19,170
Let's give it a try.

366
00:12:19,210 --> 00:12:19,930
Alright.

367
00:12:20,080 --> 00:12:21,520
MamaTare. MamaTare.
(Mama + Tarento = MamaTare)

368
00:12:22,170 --> 00:12:22,730
MamaTare?

369
00:12:22,770 --> 00:12:23,700
She's got a very nice car.
It's gotta be a MamaTare.

370
00:12:23,700 --> 00:12:24,530
She's got a very nice car.

371
00:12:24,690 --> 00:12:26,690
"Good afternoon, I am a MamaTare."

372
00:12:27,630 --> 00:12:29,200
They wouldn't say that.

373
00:12:29,260 --> 00:12:30,360
Are you a MamaTare?

374
00:12:30,730 --> 00:12:32,070
-"Yes, I'm a MamaTare"
-No way.

375
00:12:32,980 --> 00:12:34,730
He wouldn't ask it like that.

376
00:12:34,770 --> 00:12:37,100
-That's way too insane.
-Sorry, and thank you.

377
00:12:38,470 --> 00:12:39,170
-No luck?
-Yeah.

378
00:12:39,370 --> 00:12:40,920
She doesn't speak Japanese.

379
00:12:40,920 --> 00:12:41,660
Oh, she doesn't?

380
00:12:41,660 --> 00:12:41,770
She's from China.
Oh, she doesn't?

381
00:12:41,770 --> 00:12:42,660
She's from China.

382
00:12:43,100 --> 00:12:44,220
She came from China.

383
00:12:44,220 --> 00:12:44,400
-She's really pretty.
-She really is.
She came from China.

384
00:12:44,400 --> 00:12:46,000
-She's really pretty.
-She really is.

385
00:12:46,410 --> 00:12:46,530
So pretty.

386
00:12:46,530 --> 00:12:47,700
She's from China and has that car?
So pretty.

387
00:12:47,700 --> 00:12:49,000
She's from China and has that car?

388
00:12:49,280 --> 00:12:50,670
Why do you care?

389
00:12:50,790 --> 00:12:51,620
Who cares...

390
00:12:51,950 --> 00:12:53,260
I'm guessing she lives here.

391
00:12:53,300 --> 00:12:55,460
Oh, right, right.

392
00:12:55,460 --> 00:12:55,800
Yeah.
Oh, right, right.

393
00:12:55,800 --> 00:12:55,870
Yeah.

394
00:12:56,950 --> 00:12:58,480
You thought she was on holiday.

395
00:12:59,420 --> 00:13:01,540
How many Chinese celebrities can you name?

396
00:13:01,990 --> 00:13:04,490
That would depend, are we counting people from Hong Kong?

397
00:13:05,290 --> 00:13:06,000
How many?

398
00:13:06,940 --> 00:13:08,070
There's Jackie Chan, right?

399
00:13:08,250 --> 00:13:08,830
Right.

400
00:13:10,520 --> 00:13:11,870
You've got no one left, right?

401
00:13:13,360 --> 00:13:14,620
Chu Yun-fat, right?

402
00:13:15,530 --> 00:13:17,320
Chu Yun-fat? Are you serious?

403
00:13:17,440 --> 00:13:18,920
Yeah, it's Chu Yun-fat.

404
00:13:19,120 --> 00:13:21,300
From 'A Better Tomorrow'.

405
00:13:21,400 --> 00:13:22,050
Chu Yun-fat?

406
00:13:22,050 --> 00:13:22,310
Isn't it Chow Yun-fat?
Chu Yun-fat?

407
00:13:22,310 --> 00:13:22,870
Isn't it Chow Yun-fat?

408
00:13:22,870 --> 00:13:23,410
Oh right, Chow Yun-fat.
Isn't it Chow Yun-fat?

409
00:13:23,410 --> 00:13:23,870
Oh right, Chow Yun-fat.

410
00:13:27,300 --> 00:13:28,830
It's deserted...

411
00:13:29,920 --> 00:13:30,630
Totally empty.

412
00:13:32,510 --> 00:13:33,900
No one's shopping!

413
00:13:34,250 --> 00:13:35,570
How far are we going?

414
00:13:36,330 --> 00:13:36,970
Just a bit longer.

415
00:13:37,300 --> 00:13:39,030
Right, we can't go much farther than this.

416
00:13:39,030 --> 00:13:39,970
We'll turn back now.

417
00:13:40,350 --> 00:13:41,740
Wait, which way?

418
00:13:41,800 --> 00:13:42,740
Over there.

419
00:13:42,800 --> 00:13:46,120
Let's go back that way instead of this way.

420
00:13:46,360 --> 00:13:47,040
Yeah.

421
00:13:47,070 --> 00:13:47,430
Right?

422
00:13:47,830 --> 00:13:49,270
This way is definitely better.

423
00:13:49,980 --> 00:13:51,260
Also, let's stop by the Taiyaki shop.

424
00:13:51,260 --> 00:13:52,260
I wanna eat Taiyaki.

425
00:13:52,270 --> 00:13:52,900
Let's.

426
00:13:53,050 --> 00:13:53,530
-Right?
-Yeah.

427
00:13:53,880 --> 00:13:54,990
I'm craving it.

428
00:13:55,020 --> 00:13:55,780
Let's warm up.

429
00:13:56,170 --> 00:13:57,540
-Or we'll die.
-Let's search while warming up.

430
00:13:58,700 --> 00:14:04,030
The guys are heading towards the train station once again as they enter a busy street full of cars.

431
00:14:05,730 --> 00:14:08,060
There's no people on this street.

432
00:14:08,100 --> 00:14:10,750
Yeah, this street is only busy at night.

433
00:14:12,530 --> 00:14:16,170
Worst case we can go to that apartment building and knock.

434
00:14:16,750 --> 00:14:17,230
Knock?

435
00:14:18,120 --> 00:14:19,490
You never know, someone might come to greet us.

436
00:14:19,880 --> 00:14:22,000
Some celebs are bound to be living there.

437
00:14:23,070 --> 00:14:24,470
That's like the ultimate invasion of privacy.

438
00:14:24,470 --> 00:14:24,710
-Totally.
-No way, no way.
That's like the ultimate invasion of privacy.

439
00:14:24,710 --> 00:14:25,940
-Totally.
-No way, no way.

440
00:14:26,410 --> 00:14:28,850
How would you react if they come to your house?

441
00:14:29,100 --> 00:14:30,630
I'd be so pissed.

442
00:14:31,610 --> 00:14:33,370
If they suddenly rang your doorbell?

443
00:14:33,410 --> 00:14:38,370
I'd be so livid, I'd ask for the producer's name and call him every single day.

444
00:14:39,740 --> 00:14:42,110
I can't believe you came dressed like that, Tanaka.

445
00:14:43,070 --> 00:14:44,220
I'm not that cold.

446
00:14:44,390 --> 00:14:46,190
But you are!

447
00:14:46,670 --> 00:14:48,270
You dressed like it's spring.

448
00:14:48,270 --> 00:14:48,720
Really?

449
00:14:48,770 --> 00:14:49,900
It's so empty...

450
00:14:51,180 --> 00:14:52,580
For real.

451
00:14:52,670 --> 00:14:55,740
This car has to belong to a celebrity, don't you think?

452
00:14:55,750 --> 00:14:57,880
-We could wait around and see who comes to pick it up.
-Right?

453
00:14:58,420 --> 00:15:00,200
He might be having some coffee inside.

454
00:15:00,440 --> 00:15:02,870
But I'd be super pissed if they did that to me.

455
00:15:03,640 --> 00:15:04,800
But we're doing it right now.

456
00:15:07,060 --> 00:15:07,900
Are they MamaTare?

457
00:15:09,010 --> 00:15:10,010
Mama Tarento.

458
00:15:10,730 --> 00:15:12,800
-Hello.
-She could be Nozomi Tsuji.
(Nozomi Sugiura, aka Nozomi Tsuji)

459
00:15:13,670 --> 00:15:15,030
Everyone is so well dressed around here.

460
00:15:15,860 --> 00:15:18,670
It's been 35 minutes since the beginning of the search.

461
00:15:19,190 --> 00:15:21,790
The guys have arrived at Shinichinohashi intersection.

462
00:15:23,710 --> 00:15:25,750
This is Croket's place.

463
00:15:25,820 --> 00:15:26,700
Oh, this one?

464
00:15:28,060 --> 00:15:29,790
Should we wait for Croket here?
(Croket operates his own impersonation comedy show in this building.)

465
00:15:31,570 --> 00:15:33,630
I'd love to have Croket on this show.

466
00:15:34,270 --> 00:15:35,170
-This is his place.
-Right here.

467
00:15:35,700 --> 00:15:36,430
Amazing.

468
00:15:37,180 --> 00:15:39,270
-We came here once, right?
-Yeah.

469
00:15:39,700 --> 00:15:40,270
You're right.

470
00:15:40,900 --> 00:15:41,800
When they had just opened.

471
00:15:41,800 --> 00:15:42,580
They are in such a prime location.
When they had just opened.

472
00:15:42,580 --> 00:15:43,470
They are in such a prime location.

473
00:15:43,540 --> 00:15:44,900
His gags are filling my mind again.

474
00:15:46,470 --> 00:15:48,600
-That's amazing.
-It really is.

475
00:15:48,900 --> 00:15:50,470
Hey! Don't just go look all at once!

476
00:15:50,700 --> 00:15:52,810
What are we gonna do if someone passes by?!

477
00:15:53,670 --> 00:15:54,300
Tanaka!

478
00:15:58,240 --> 00:15:59,570
Just take turns, dammit!

479
00:16:00,740 --> 00:16:03,830
Hamada is totally in the right this time, so I can't talk back.

480
00:16:04,370 --> 00:16:04,870
You're right.

481
00:16:05,100 --> 00:16:06,340
All of us went to see.

482
00:16:06,380 --> 00:16:07,450
We were so focused.

483
00:16:07,460 --> 00:16:07,930
We were all like: "Amazing!"

484
00:16:07,930 --> 00:16:08,530
All of you piled up at once.
We were all like: "Amazing!"

485
00:16:08,530 --> 00:16:10,060
All of you piled up at once.

486
00:16:12,100 --> 00:16:13,130
Totally.

487
00:16:13,520 --> 00:16:14,150
"Amazing!"

488
00:16:14,150 --> 00:16:14,380
Is there such a scary program?
"Amazing!"

489
00:16:14,380 --> 00:16:15,720
Is there such a scary program?

490
00:16:17,560 --> 00:16:18,630
Should we walk towards the shopping district?

491
00:16:19,200 --> 00:16:21,160
And the guys go on the day's second lap around Azabujuban.

492
00:16:21,780 --> 00:16:24,670
Once again, they search around Azabujuban's main street.

493
00:16:25,500 --> 00:16:27,490
It's already our second lap.

494
00:16:27,690 --> 00:16:29,110
We've entered the second lap.

495
00:16:29,780 --> 00:16:31,450
We've already been through here.

496
00:16:31,860 --> 00:16:32,930
Yeah...

497
00:16:32,950 --> 00:16:33,630
Right...

498
00:16:34,940 --> 00:16:36,300
I'm telling you, let's go to the Taiyaki spot.

499
00:16:36,930 --> 00:16:38,030
Why Taiyaki?!

500
00:16:40,000 --> 00:16:41,130
Should we take a break?

501
00:16:41,420 --> 00:16:41,930
Here?

502
00:16:44,240 --> 00:16:48,100
Can we even afford to go to a side street coffee shop?

503
00:16:48,440 --> 00:16:49,090
We'll keep searching while we rest.

504
00:16:49,090 --> 00:16:50,620
There's a coffee shop with an outside terrace just further down the road.
We'll keep searching while we rest.

505
00:16:50,620 --> 00:16:53,410
There's a coffee shop with an outside terrace just further down the road.

506
00:16:53,410 --> 00:16:54,650
A terrace?
Do you mean outside?!

507
00:16:54,880 --> 00:16:56,470
Yes, they have those heaters.

508
00:16:58,150 --> 00:16:59,200
No way...

509
00:17:01,680 --> 00:17:03,300
I think that's fine.

510
00:17:05,040 --> 00:17:06,770
I mean, we're filming...

511
00:17:07,330 --> 00:17:09,470
Once you go mad, you just stay mad.

512
00:17:09,470 --> 00:17:10,230
Hold on, I'm not mad.
I'm not.
Once you go mad, you just stay mad.

513
00:17:10,230 --> 00:17:11,300
Hold on, I'm not mad.
I'm not.

514
00:17:11,300 --> 00:17:12,200
He's so scary, isn't he?
Hold on, I'm not mad.
I'm not.

515
00:17:12,830 --> 00:17:14,070
Geez...

516
00:17:14,820 --> 00:17:16,430
So, we're not getting the Taiyaki?

517
00:17:16,670 --> 00:17:18,410
How badly do you want those Taiyaki?!

518
00:17:18,690 --> 00:17:21,990
He's been going off about Taiyaki this, and Taiyaki that.

519
00:17:22,100 --> 00:17:22,930
Really?

520
00:17:23,530 --> 00:17:25,840
I wanted some at the beginning, but not anymore.

521
00:17:26,270 --> 00:17:27,770
You can eat Taiyaki anytime you want.

522
00:17:27,770 --> 00:17:28,450
But why Taiyaki?
You can eat Taiyaki anytime you want.

523
00:17:28,450 --> 00:17:29,450
But why Taiyaki?

524
00:17:29,450 --> 00:17:29,860
-I mean, we're already here...
-You're really keen on the Taiyaki.
But why Taiyaki?

525
00:17:29,860 --> 00:17:32,390
-I mean, we're already here...
-You're really keen on the Taiyaki.

526
00:17:32,400 --> 00:17:36,260
But that place doesn't have a great view of the street.

527
00:17:36,610 --> 00:17:38,070
We'll just get take out.

528
00:17:38,570 --> 00:17:39,640
There's the Taiyaki shop.

529
00:17:39,900 --> 00:17:40,950
This is the famous place, right?

530
00:17:40,950 --> 00:17:42,830
That's right. Look at the queue!

531
00:17:42,840 --> 00:17:44,200
There's always a line.

532
00:17:45,670 --> 00:17:46,170
That's amazing.

533
00:17:46,170 --> 00:17:48,370
Can't someone on staff stand in line for me?

534
00:17:48,770 --> 00:17:50,770
How much do you wanna eat them?!

535
00:17:50,830 --> 00:17:51,820
We're already here...

536
00:17:51,820 --> 00:17:52,020
There's another shop over there, look!
We're already here...

537
00:17:52,020 --> 00:17:53,640
There's another shop over there, look!

538
00:17:53,640 --> 00:17:54,030
But those are the famous ones!
There's another shop over there, look!

539
00:17:54,030 --> 00:17:55,080
But those are the famous ones!

540
00:17:55,170 --> 00:17:56,390
Oh, those aren't Taiyaki.

541
00:17:56,440 --> 00:17:57,980
Those are Imagawayaki.

542
00:17:57,980 --> 00:17:58,470
No, no, no, I want Taiyaki.
Those are Imagawayaki.

543
00:17:58,470 --> 00:17:58,970
No, no, no, I want Taiyaki.

544
00:17:58,970 --> 00:17:59,320
-It's just a different shape!
-Oonuma!
No, no, no, I want Taiyaki.

545
00:17:59,320 --> 00:18:00,430
-It's just a different shape!
-Oonuma!

546
00:18:01,140 --> 00:18:02,200
Get in line!

547
00:18:03,970 --> 00:18:06,210
Imagawa and Taiyaki are just shaped differently!

548
00:18:07,690 --> 00:18:09,390
Poor Oonuma...

549
00:18:09,950 --> 00:18:11,830
He's got a very important job now.

550
00:18:12,290 --> 00:18:13,870
Let's go to the coffee shop.

551
00:18:14,720 --> 00:18:15,830
Where's this coffee shop?

552
00:18:16,280 --> 00:18:17,530
A bit further.

553
00:18:18,130 --> 00:18:19,600
It's Heipo's building again.

554
00:18:19,870 --> 00:18:20,770
Heipo!

555
00:18:23,830 --> 00:18:25,160
He's not coming out...

556
00:18:25,220 --> 00:18:25,630
Right?

557
00:18:25,630 --> 00:18:27,660
He's gotta come out eventually.

558
00:18:28,870 --> 00:18:29,790
We've been yelling for him this whole time.

559
00:18:29,830 --> 00:18:31,300
He's never coming out.

560
00:18:32,310 --> 00:18:34,110
It's been 50 minutes since the start of the search.

561
00:18:34,800 --> 00:18:38,150
They guys are having a break in an open coffee shop while they wait for the Taiyaki to arrive.

562
00:18:38,620 --> 00:18:39,620
This spot is warm.

563
00:18:39,920 --> 00:18:44,470
The guys sharpen their gazes so as to not miss any celebrities.

564
00:18:44,840 --> 00:18:45,890
This isn't that great...

565
00:18:47,170 --> 00:18:48,030
I know what you mean.

566
00:18:48,210 --> 00:18:49,210
But actually...

567
00:18:49,430 --> 00:18:50,600
What about that guy?

568
00:18:50,700 --> 00:18:52,610
That guy’s wearing a mask.

569
00:18:52,780 --> 00:18:53,940
-With the coat?
-Yes.

570
00:18:53,990 --> 00:18:54,700
Who? Who?

571
00:18:54,930 --> 00:18:56,530
That rapper guy.

572
00:18:56,610 --> 00:18:57,730
-Who could he even be?!
-I wouldn't know his name.

573
00:18:59,730 --> 00:19:02,430
I would never know his name if he's really a rapper.

574
00:19:02,490 --> 00:19:03,730
Right...

575
00:19:04,660 --> 00:19:08,170
He does look like he's in the entertainment business.

576
00:19:08,430 --> 00:19:10,230
I only know KREVA.
(Takashi Hatakeyama, aka Kreva)

577
00:19:10,630 --> 00:19:12,800
No luck. They are just normal employees.

578
00:19:12,800 --> 00:19:14,100
It wasn't Zeebra?
(Hideyuki Yokoi, aka Zeebra)

579
00:19:14,470 --> 00:19:15,670
It wasn't Zeebra.

580
00:19:16,540 --> 00:19:17,400
I only know of Zeebra.

581
00:19:17,700 --> 00:19:18,170
Rappers?

582
00:19:22,100 --> 00:19:25,430
And then... Endo notices something!

583
00:19:27,430 --> 00:19:27,930
What?!

584
00:19:29,620 --> 00:19:33,100
Have they finally found a celebrity?!

585
00:19:35,410 --> 00:19:37,230
The members were all enjoying a coffee in their break time.

586
00:19:37,810 --> 00:19:40,130
When Endo notices something!

587
00:19:42,950 --> 00:19:43,400
What?

588
00:19:45,820 --> 00:19:46,230
Look!

589
00:19:48,630 --> 00:19:51,630
Have they finally found a celebrity?!

590
00:19:51,940 --> 00:19:53,230
Hello! Hello! Hello!

591
00:19:54,850 --> 00:19:56,310
What are you doing here?!

592
00:19:57,160 --> 00:19:58,060
What are you doing?

593
00:19:58,080 --> 00:19:58,650
These your kids?

594
00:19:58,830 --> 00:19:59,050
Yes, yes.

595
00:19:59,050 --> 00:19:59,370
Oh, your kids!
Yes, yes.

596
00:19:59,370 --> 00:19:59,970
Oh, your kids!

597
00:20:01,390 --> 00:20:02,210
What are you up to?

598
00:20:02,360 --> 00:20:04,130
Yeah, well I'm just doing some pickup.

599
00:20:04,830 --> 00:20:05,840
Picking up my kids from school.

600
00:20:05,840 --> 00:20:06,630
And you've got that with you?!
Picking up my kids from school.

601
00:20:06,630 --> 00:20:07,490
And you've got that with you?!

602
00:20:07,500 --> 00:20:09,130
-This is so perfect!
-I've been playing this while we walk.

603
00:20:09,140 --> 00:20:10,080
While you walk?

604
00:20:12,030 --> 00:20:13,200
That's amazing!

605
00:20:14,220 --> 00:20:16,570
You've got a guitar with you on your pickup?!

606
00:20:16,800 --> 00:20:17,830
You see, we're filming a show right now.

607
00:20:17,830 --> 00:20:18,900
Is that so?
You see, we're filming a show right now.

608
00:20:18,900 --> 00:20:19,300
Is that so?

609
00:20:19,330 --> 00:20:21,900
We can't go home until we find a celebrity.

610
00:20:21,900 --> 00:20:22,270
Oh, really?
We can't go home until we find a celebrity.

611
00:20:22,270 --> 00:20:22,900
Oh, really?

612
00:20:22,920 --> 00:20:24,110
Everyone knows his name, right?

613
00:20:24,110 --> 00:20:25,070
One, two...

614
00:20:25,300 --> 00:20:26,300
Thane Camus!
(Thane Alexander Camus)

615
00:20:26,660 --> 00:20:27,330
Thank you.

616
00:20:29,990 --> 00:20:31,480
By the way, we can air this, right?

617
00:20:31,520 --> 00:20:32,430
Of course, I don't mind at all.

618
00:20:32,430 --> 00:20:32,710
Okay!
Of course, I don't mind at all.

619
00:20:32,710 --> 00:20:33,230
Okay!

620
00:20:33,970 --> 00:20:35,250
All clear! All clear!

621
00:20:35,250 --> 00:20:37,620
We should blur your children's faces, right?

622
00:20:37,780 --> 00:20:39,600
Well, he's actually on NHK right now.

623
00:20:41,570 --> 00:20:42,570
You also play?

624
00:20:42,590 --> 00:20:44,160
Yours is way bigger than your father's.

625
00:20:44,570 --> 00:20:45,670
This one's huge.

626
00:20:45,670 --> 00:20:45,940
Or this one's just really tiny.
This one's huge.

627
00:20:45,940 --> 00:20:46,830
Or this one's just really tiny.

628
00:20:46,990 --> 00:20:49,510
We were just walking around and playing.

629
00:20:52,070 --> 00:20:52,830
That's nice.

630
00:20:53,260 --> 00:20:54,070
While you walked?

631
00:20:54,620 --> 00:20:55,410
It's very cold.

632
00:20:56,560 --> 00:20:59,900
Yes, it's so cold my fingers hurt.

633
00:21:00,060 --> 00:21:01,430
What a cheerful encounter.

634
00:21:02,170 --> 00:21:03,300
I was so shocked.

635
00:21:03,300 --> 00:21:04,360
You're such a good dad.
I was so shocked.

636
00:21:04,360 --> 00:21:04,770
You're such a good dad.

637
00:21:05,370 --> 00:21:06,130
-Right?
-Right?

638
00:21:06,500 --> 00:21:07,820
We've completed our mission.

639
00:21:07,820 --> 00:21:09,450
Thank you.
We've completed our mission.

640
00:21:09,450 --> 00:21:09,490
Thank you.

641
00:21:10,270 --> 00:21:10,930
Success!

642
00:21:10,930 --> 00:21:11,540
We've hit it out of the park.
Success!

643
00:21:11,540 --> 00:21:12,400
We've hit it out of the park.

644
00:21:12,400 --> 00:21:12,530
Mission complete.
We've hit it out of the park.

645
00:21:12,530 --> 00:21:13,370
Mission complete.

646
00:21:14,460 --> 00:21:15,570
Anyway, thank you.

647
00:21:15,640 --> 00:21:17,030
No, thank you.

648
00:21:17,390 --> 00:21:18,800
Who spotted you?

649
00:21:19,460 --> 00:21:19,910
Endo.

650
00:21:20,770 --> 00:21:22,580
I was spacing out and I just saw him.

651
00:21:23,330 --> 00:21:24,470
Wonderful!

652
00:21:24,880 --> 00:21:26,150
That's wonderful!

653
00:21:26,290 --> 00:21:28,190
We would have totally missed him otherwise!

654
00:21:28,760 --> 00:21:29,490
Thank you.

655
00:21:30,450 --> 00:21:31,850
Anyway, let's grab our tea.

656
00:21:32,070 --> 00:21:32,950
Thank you.

657
00:21:33,610 --> 00:21:34,420
Take care.

658
00:21:34,600 --> 00:21:35,200
Let's go back inside.

659
00:21:35,200 --> 00:21:35,550
We're so lucky.
Let's go back inside.

660
00:21:35,550 --> 00:21:37,030
We're so lucky.

661
00:21:37,030 --> 00:21:37,250
We smashed this one.
We're so lucky.

662
00:21:37,250 --> 00:21:38,630
We smashed this one.

663
00:21:38,680 --> 00:21:40,700
It was juuust right.

664
00:21:42,110 --> 00:21:44,900
Thane Camus is juuust right!

665
00:21:46,500 --> 00:21:47,170
Right?

666
00:21:47,540 --> 00:21:49,870
-He's a perfectly normal guy.
-Totally.

667
00:21:50,530 --> 00:21:50,910
Right?

668
00:21:50,950 --> 00:21:52,640
And he was picking up his two kids.

669
00:21:52,980 --> 00:21:54,790
It's juuust perfect!

670
00:21:55,280 --> 00:21:57,340
That's Azabujuban for you.

671
00:21:57,470 --> 00:21:57,870
It was just right.

672
00:21:57,870 --> 00:21:58,550
It's suuuper real!
It was just right.

673
00:21:58,550 --> 00:22:00,730
It's suuuper real!

674
00:22:01,440 --> 00:22:02,800
And it was also the perfect timing.

675
00:22:04,030 --> 00:22:06,510
You asked him if his kids could be on the show right?
And we're only blurring his daugher.

676
00:22:07,070 --> 00:22:07,770
Yeah.

677
00:22:07,770 --> 00:22:09,680
That was also just perfect.

678
00:22:10,300 --> 00:22:11,780
It adds to that feeling of reality.

679
00:22:11,780 --> 00:22:12,060
Totally.
It adds to that feeling of reality.

680
00:22:12,060 --> 00:22:12,300
Totally.

681
00:22:12,300 --> 00:22:12,470
But the older brother can be on TV, right?
Totally.

682
00:22:12,470 --> 00:22:14,610
But the older brother can be on TV, right?

683
00:22:15,370 --> 00:22:17,350
We actually found two celebrities.

684
00:22:18,860 --> 00:22:19,930
He's on NHK, right?

685
00:22:19,970 --> 00:22:20,660
Yes.

686
00:22:21,500 --> 00:22:24,800
Now I'm starting to get really pissed off about those Taiyaki.

687
00:22:25,950 --> 00:22:27,630
Why the hell is that guy waiting for your damn Taiyaki?!

688
00:22:28,270 --> 00:22:29,830
I was just about to mention this...

689
00:22:30,040 --> 00:22:31,420
I'm over Taiyaki.

690
00:22:31,630 --> 00:22:32,800
Right?

691
00:22:34,210 --> 00:22:37,270
We met a celebrity and that guy's stuck in line!

692
00:22:39,060 --> 00:22:40,850
Your priorities are completely backwards!

693
00:22:42,820 --> 00:22:43,770
Heipo is here!

694
00:22:45,270 --> 00:22:45,590
Heipo.

695
00:22:45,590 --> 00:22:45,930
Heipo don't you live over there?
Heipo.

696
00:22:45,930 --> 00:22:46,740
Heipo don't you live over there?

697
00:22:46,960 --> 00:22:48,100
Yes, I am living there.

698
00:22:48,250 --> 00:22:48,800
What?!

699
00:22:49,020 --> 00:22:49,930
-Really?
-Yes.

700
00:22:50,060 --> 00:22:54,310
Alright, then can you go back and wave at us from your window when we yell your name?

701
00:22:54,550 --> 00:22:56,340
We wanna get that shot.

702
00:22:56,590 --> 00:22:58,600
You're really doing this for us?

703
00:22:58,730 --> 00:23:00,700
Does your apartment face the street?

704
00:23:00,780 --> 00:23:02,380
Yes, it does.

705
00:23:02,970 --> 00:23:03,090
Amazing.

706
00:23:03,090 --> 00:23:03,470
This is such a pain in the ass.
Amazing.

707
00:23:03,470 --> 00:23:04,260
This is such a pain in the ass.

708
00:23:05,560 --> 00:23:07,530
It's right over there.

709
00:23:07,530 --> 00:23:07,790
It's just a little extra for the viewers.
It's right over there.

710
00:23:07,790 --> 00:23:11,260
It's just a little extra for the viewers.

711
00:23:13,240 --> 00:23:17,390
Lastly, the guys have decided to go by Heipo's building in Azabujuban.

712
00:23:17,490 --> 00:23:18,670
Yes, I am living there.

713
00:23:19,560 --> 00:23:20,430
-Really?
-Yes.

714
00:23:21,050 --> 00:23:23,100
We're here, right?

715
00:23:23,120 --> 00:23:23,670
It's here.

716
00:23:24,580 --> 00:23:25,830
What floor is he on?

717
00:23:25,830 --> 00:23:27,000
I wonder...

718
00:23:28,170 --> 00:23:28,970
Ready?

719
00:23:29,000 --> 00:23:30,210
-Alright.
-Let's go.

720
00:23:30,480 --> 00:23:31,570
-Can he even hear us?
-Ready?

721
00:23:31,960 --> 00:23:33,000
Heipo!

722
00:23:34,690 --> 00:23:35,670
Oh, it's right there!

723
00:23:36,760 --> 00:23:37,400
Heipo?

724
00:23:42,100 --> 00:23:44,000
Oh, there he is.

725
00:23:44,380 --> 00:23:45,900
This is so funny.

726
00:23:46,030 --> 00:23:46,700
You're right!

727
00:23:46,970 --> 00:23:48,030
So funny!

728
00:23:48,240 --> 00:23:49,730
There he goes!

729
00:23:50,060 --> 00:23:51,450
This is hilarious.

730
00:23:52,610 --> 00:23:54,200
I didn't think he'd be this close.

731
00:23:54,700 --> 00:23:56,830
He looks like a patient at a hospital.

732
00:23:57,480 --> 00:24:00,470
I thought he'd be so far away we could barely see him.

733
00:24:01,230 --> 00:24:02,200
But he's right there!

734
00:24:03,190 --> 00:24:05,470
His window is getting really misty.

735
00:24:06,800 --> 00:24:08,230
The humidity in that room is no joke!
