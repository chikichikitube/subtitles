1
00:00:00,480 --> 00:00:04,680
Sho-ta

2
00:00:20,050 --> 00:00:24,180
Sho-ta! Sho-ta.
- Hey, you have to get it together.

3
00:01:00,180 --> 00:01:01,680
(What?)

4
00:01:01,680 --> 00:01:04,050
(What are you doing?)

5
00:01:04,050 --> 00:01:06,110
What are you doing?

6
00:01:07,110 --> 00:01:08,810
A funeral.

7
00:01:08,810 --> 00:01:10,580
You are doing a funeral?

8
00:01:10,980 --> 00:01:12,550
Dead?

9
00:01:13,450 --> 00:01:15,310
Am I dead?

10
00:01:15,310 --> 00:01:18,510
Yes, you are dead. - Really?

11
00:01:22,710 --> 00:01:24,650
It's so boring.

12
00:01:24,650 --> 00:01:27,180
What? - I'm so bored.

13
00:01:27,180 --> 00:01:29,380
Tired? - Bored.

14
00:01:29,380 --> 00:01:31,480
That's the way it has to be.

15
00:01:38,080 --> 00:01:40,810
My condolences.

16
00:01:55,410 --> 00:01:57,410
What are you doing?!

17
00:01:57,410 --> 00:01:59,710
What... - I'm so sorry.

18
00:01:59,710 --> 00:02:01,680
Hey!

19
00:02:01,680 --> 00:02:04,180
Hey! - My mouth was kind of...

20
00:02:04,180 --> 00:02:06,210
I apologize for this.

21
00:02:06,210 --> 00:02:08,750
I spit it... - Hey. - Sorry.

22
00:02:08,750 --> 00:02:10,610
I just felt something was
wrong with my mouth.

23
00:02:10,610 --> 00:02:15,550
Don't do that again! Please excuse him.

24
00:02:15,550 --> 00:02:18,210
Just sit there.

25
00:02:18,210 --> 00:02:23,350
Don't misbehave. I'm very sorry.

26
00:02:43,180 --> 00:02:44,780
Ouch!

27
00:02:44,980 --> 00:02:46,550
Hey!

28
00:02:46,550 --> 00:02:50,180
Hey! - I'm terribly sorry.
What's the matter with you?

29
00:02:50,210 --> 00:02:52,610
I thought I heard you saying
something about snapping...

30
00:02:52,610 --> 00:02:55,750
What? What the hell is that?

31
00:02:55,750 --> 00:02:58,780
Are you nuts? - I'm sorry.

32
00:02:58,780 --> 00:03:01,610
Hey! knock it off!

33
00:03:01,610 --> 00:03:03,210
Obviously, I was wrong.

34
00:03:03,210 --> 00:03:07,380
I apologize. Please continue.
- obviously someone doesn't want me here.

35
00:03:07,380 --> 00:03:09,980
Please. For my son.

36
00:03:09,980 --> 00:03:12,150
That's enough! - Sorry.

37
00:03:12,150 --> 00:03:14,350
Please. - OK.

38
00:03:33,280 --> 00:03:35,580
(what's the matter with you?!)

39
00:03:39,580 --> 00:03:41,880
(Cut it out!)

40
00:03:44,680 --> 00:03:47,810
Look! Baldie!

41
00:03:48,910 --> 00:03:50,450
Baldie!

42
00:03:50,550 --> 00:03:52,080
(OK, OK.)

43
00:03:55,180 --> 00:03:57,350
Say "Baldie!"

44
00:03:57,350 --> 00:04:00,180
(What?) - Say "Baldie!"

45
00:04:00,180 --> 00:04:02,210
Say it.

46
00:04:02,210 --> 00:04:03,980
(No way.)

47
00:04:04,580 --> 00:04:06,350
Just say it.

48
00:04:06,350 --> 00:04:09,050
"Baldie!" - (No!)

49
00:04:09,050 --> 00:04:11,350
Baldie! - (Never!)

50
00:04:11,350 --> 00:04:13,880
Baldie... - Baldie!! - Hey!!

51
00:04:13,880 --> 00:04:17,350
Hey! - You are a baldie.

52
00:04:17,350 --> 00:04:21,180
You baldy priest!

53
00:04:21,180 --> 00:04:24,250
Hey! - Don't you see you are bald?

54
00:04:24,250 --> 00:04:27,180
Hey! This is it! - Sorry.

55
00:04:27,180 --> 00:04:28,980
What are you thinking?

56
00:04:28,980 --> 00:04:33,510
I'm out. - Please stop. - He's bald!

57
00:04:34,610 --> 00:04:37,650
I am sorry. I am.

58
00:04:44,350 --> 00:04:47,310
This is way out of line. - Sorry.

59
00:04:47,310 --> 00:04:50,880
Do you really understand?
- I am terribly sorry.

60
00:04:50,880 --> 00:04:54,410
Please continue. - Please.

61
00:05:09,210 --> 00:05:12,080
Stinking priest! - You stinking priest!!

62
00:05:13,380 --> 00:05:14,850
Hey!

63
00:05:24,450 --> 00:05:27,310
Just knock it off. - Shut up.

64
00:05:28,210 --> 00:05:31,250
I've had it. I'm out. - Please wait!

65
00:05:35,890 --> 00:05:37,980
I'm very sorry.
