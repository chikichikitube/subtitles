1
00:00:30,480 --> 00:00:32,780
That just means you've got old.

2
00:00:32,780 --> 00:00:34,950
I mean, who can live without it?

3
00:00:36,310 --> 00:00:38,680
What? Don't you think so?

4
00:00:38,650 --> 00:00:44,250
What makes you talk like that. You are not convincing.

5
00:00:44,880 --> 00:00:46,510
What I want to ask you is

6
00:00:46,510 --> 00:00:49,310
To let me have that in this show, pleeease.

7
00:00:50,910 --> 00:00:53,550
You're a lousy actor.

8
00:00:53,480 --> 00:00:55,680
There're some programs for that.

9
00:00:55,680 --> 00:00:58,010
In which two TV talents dates.

10
00:00:58,150 --> 00:00:59,350
There are a lot in these days.

11
00:00:59,510 --> 00:01:01,250
Let me do it.

12
00:01:01,250 --> 00:01:34,570
no sub

13
00:01:45,320 --> 00:01:49,020
They've found you a wonderful date.

14
00:01:48,780 --> 00:01:50,120
Really? You've already arranged for me?

15
00:01:49,820 --> 00:01:53,530
She is definitely rich.

16
00:01:52,660 --> 00:01:53,360
Is she?

17
00:01:53,930 --> 00:01:56,800
And she seems to be your type.

18
00:01:57,800 --> 00:01:58,860
Does she have this(big breast)?

19
00:01:58,860 --> 00:02:02,330
I don't know if she has that.
Why should she have to have that?

20
00:02:02,330 --> 00:02:04,800
To me a beauty means this.

21
00:02:04,800 --> 00:02:07,270
no sub

22
00:02:07,470 --> 00:02:11,280
Rendezvous at Hibiya Park

23
00:02:11,580 --> 00:02:16,280
There's a woman waiting for him in this bad weather.

24
00:02:17,320 --> 00:02:23,790
Oh, Ms. Nishikawa Ayako. Look at that fluffy thing.

25
00:02:18,350 --> 00:02:23,660
TN: Ayako Nishikawa is a Surgeon and TV talent.

26
00:02:19,020 --> 00:02:24,160
Ayako Nishikawa

27
00:02:19,020 --> 00:02:24,160
His date

28
00:02:24,760 --> 00:02:28,960
Heipo with a nervous look on his
face goes to the meeting spot.

29
00:02:29,090 --> 00:02:31,460
It's cold outside.

30
00:02:31,460 --> 00:02:34,970
Here he comes! From behind.

31
00:02:35,270 --> 00:02:40,610
They come from behind in those other shows too.

32
00:02:41,640 --> 00:02:42,770
Excuse me.

33
00:02:43,480 --> 00:02:44,680
Look at that.

34
00:02:43,810 --> 00:02:44,680
Are you?

35
00:02:44,680 --> 00:02:45,610
Oh, yes.

36
00:02:45,480 --> 00:02:46,440
Are you my date?

37
00:02:46,610 --> 00:02:48,480
My name is Nishikawa Ayako.

38
00:02:48,250 --> 00:02:49,580
Nice to meet you. My name is Heipo.

39
00:02:49,580 --> 00:02:52,480
Worldly acclaimed Heipo, the director of the show.

40
00:02:50,520 --> 00:02:52,620
He said "worldly acclaimed Heipo".

41
00:02:52,650 --> 00:02:53,520
Mr. Heipo.

42
00:02:53,920 --> 00:02:55,550
Of course you are familiar with the show, aren't you?

43
00:02:55,490 --> 00:02:57,790
Yes, on TV.

44
00:02:56,890 --> 00:02:58,620
Look how presumptuous he is.

45
00:02:59,990 --> 00:03:01,590
He presumes a lot.

46
00:03:01,660 --> 00:03:03,630
OK, shall we?

47
00:03:03,160 --> 00:03:04,700
Very aggressive.

48
00:03:03,500 --> 00:03:04,460
Yes.

49
00:03:05,400 --> 00:03:08,470
It's a shame it's raining.

50
00:03:06,900 --> 00:03:09,600
Yes, it is.

51
00:03:09,100 --> 00:03:10,570
He's holding the umbrella only for himself!

52
00:03:11,840 --> 00:03:15,640
She's a bit different from what she usually is.

53
00:03:15,640 --> 00:03:18,610
More feminine. Don't you think so?

54
00:03:20,480 --> 00:03:23,550
Maybe hooking her up with him wasn't such a bad idea.

55
00:03:24,450 --> 00:03:28,990
They arrived at a cafe

56
00:03:29,090 --> 00:03:31,960
What kind of man do you like?

57
00:03:32,120 --> 00:03:37,400
Well... I like a competent man.

58
00:03:34,590 --> 00:03:37,700
He's getting right into the point.

59
00:03:37,260 --> 00:03:41,600
Really? That's great. People always say I'm competent.

60
00:03:41,770 --> 00:03:42,770
Really?

61
00:03:42,470 --> 00:03:42,970
Yes.

62
00:03:43,000 --> 00:03:46,100
What do your other family do?

63
00:03:45,470 --> 00:03:47,340
My father is a doctor.

64
00:03:48,110 --> 00:03:51,280
That means your family is genetically horny, right?

65
00:03:51,510 --> 00:03:53,280
No, we are not!

66
00:03:55,810 --> 00:03:57,520
He's trying to offend her?

67
00:03:58,750 --> 00:03:59,450
Yes?

68
00:04:00,620 --> 00:04:08,430
They have to follow
the instruction in the letter

69
00:04:02,420 --> 00:04:06,630
It says "Heipo and Ayako's love plan".

70
00:04:02,590 --> 00:04:04,220
There's a instruction.

71
00:04:06,630 --> 00:04:08,090
Can I open this?

72
00:04:07,760 --> 00:04:08,430
Yes.

73
00:04:08,590 --> 00:04:11,300
The guy makes the girl happy.

74
00:04:12,600 --> 00:04:14,570
I think "the girl" refers to me.

75
00:04:13,000 --> 00:04:15,770
I should do something to make you happy.

76
00:04:16,570 --> 00:04:17,940
This is crucial.

77
00:04:17,700 --> 00:04:19,600
What's your hobby?

78
00:04:20,040 --> 00:04:23,170
Golf is my sports.

79
00:04:22,040 --> 00:04:24,840
Is it? I'm very good at it.

80
00:04:24,910 --> 00:04:26,110
You are?

81
00:04:26,110 --> 00:04:29,810
Single digit handicap. I can give you a lesson if you like.

82
00:04:26,910 --> 00:04:28,050
Really?

83
00:04:28,480 --> 00:04:29,910
He said "single digit".

84
00:04:29,810 --> 00:04:31,780
I'm impressed. Can you give me a lesson?

85
00:04:30,620 --> 00:04:32,780
Yes. Can I give you now?

86
00:04:31,680 --> 00:04:33,690
I got a very bad vibe about this.

87
00:04:37,020 --> 00:04:38,490
No, that's no good.

88
00:04:38,490 --> 00:04:41,860
You have to use your waist.

89
00:04:41,860 --> 00:04:44,700
Stick your hip. Yes, that's it.

90
00:04:43,930 --> 00:04:44,700
Is this OK?

91
00:04:44,700 --> 00:04:46,700
May be a little more, OK?

92
00:04:48,100 --> 00:04:50,100
What's he doing?

93
00:04:48,600 --> 00:04:50,370
Let's swing in this position.

94
00:04:49,870 --> 00:04:50,900
Like this?

95
00:04:53,070 --> 00:04:54,270
Oh, very good.

96
00:04:54,370 --> 00:04:56,510
This is bad. He's grabbing her ass.

97
00:05:00,110 --> 00:05:02,050
OK, I get it, you can let your hands off now.

98
00:05:01,510 --> 00:05:05,450
Now you understand you have to stick your hip
when you swing, don't you?

99
00:05:05,120 --> 00:05:07,720
Yes, I do, thank you.

100
00:05:05,520 --> 00:05:07,150
If you want more lessons let me know.

101
00:05:07,790 --> 00:05:12,020
By the way, I read this article in some magazine.

102
00:05:12,020 --> 00:05:15,990
That women like to be carried in men's arms.

103
00:05:15,760 --> 00:05:17,900
Off course we do.

104
00:05:17,160 --> 00:05:20,200
So, as in this letter, I can make you happy by...

105
00:05:20,200 --> 00:05:22,270
Do you want me to do it?

106
00:05:22,270 --> 00:05:25,270
His intention is too obvious.

107
00:05:22,570 --> 00:05:23,670
What?

108
00:05:28,240 --> 00:05:28,270
Oh, no.

109
00:05:29,240 --> 00:05:32,440
Oh, this is very very good.

110
00:05:32,080 --> 00:05:34,610
OK, thank you, now please let me...

111
00:05:33,350 --> 00:05:35,450
She's fighting back.

112
00:05:35,180 --> 00:05:38,120
No, please, I mean it!

113
00:05:36,750 --> 00:05:38,520
She's fighting back really hard.

114
00:05:38,120 --> 00:05:40,120
No. Really.

115
00:05:40,350 --> 00:05:41,920
No, no, no.

116
00:05:43,120 --> 00:05:44,920
No, no! Stop it!!

117
00:05:47,090 --> 00:05:48,790
What's the matter with you?

118
00:05:50,500 --> 00:05:52,960
She left her microphone.

119
00:05:50,630 --> 00:05:52,400
I can't take it any more.

120
00:05:55,100 --> 00:05:56,700
What should I do now?

121
00:05:57,670 --> 00:06:01,210
Due to his sexual harassment of her
shooting was stopped.

122
00:06:01,740 --> 00:06:03,480
Heipo. Come here.

123
00:06:03,480 --> 00:06:06,110
What do you think you're doing?

124
00:06:04,610 --> 00:06:05,880
What do you mean?

125
00:06:07,410 --> 00:06:08,780
What are you trying to do?

126
00:06:08,780 --> 00:06:13,120
You did all that to get exciting feelings?

127
00:06:12,780 --> 00:06:15,820
No, I did that because I had a feeling of excitement.

128
00:06:16,390 --> 00:06:19,420
And I read in a magazine that women like that.

129
00:06:19,260 --> 00:06:21,290
What are you, still in school?

130
00:06:21,460 --> 00:06:22,890
You have to apologize to her.

131
00:06:23,060 --> 00:06:25,700
OK, I'll write a letter of apology.

132
00:06:25,700 --> 00:06:28,970
So please give me a second chance.

133
00:06:30,370 --> 00:06:36,440
Nishikawa certainly did not expected this.
She is furious and went back to her dressing room.

134
00:06:37,740 --> 00:06:41,280
We have to do something.
Otherwise the shooting is over.

135
00:06:41,810 --> 00:06:46,280
So Heipo reads a letter of apology to ask
her forgiveness. And ask her to continue.

136
00:06:48,420 --> 00:06:49,620
How are you doing?

137
00:06:55,560 --> 00:06:56,800
Hello.

138
00:06:57,800 --> 00:06:59,200
He wants to apologize to you.

139
00:06:58,900 --> 00:07:02,100
I come here to apologize...so please listen...

140
00:07:01,000 --> 00:07:04,270
No. No. I don't want to listen.

141
00:07:02,470 --> 00:07:05,500
I understand your feeling, but please.

142
00:07:03,470 --> 00:07:07,610
I write this letter very earnestly. Please listen.

143
00:07:08,810 --> 00:07:13,140
I, worldly acclaimed Heipo, offended

144
00:07:13,140 --> 00:07:16,880
Ms. Nishikawa Ayako, TV talent and surgeon

145
00:07:16,880 --> 00:07:20,350
during the shooting...

146
00:07:22,190 --> 00:07:23,120
Just a minute.

147
00:07:26,590 --> 00:07:29,630
Sorry I will do it right. Ouch.

148
00:07:31,260 --> 00:07:32,960
Why the hell did you laugh, huh?

149
00:07:32,460 --> 00:07:34,600
I shouldn't. There's absolutely no reason.

150
00:07:36,170 --> 00:07:40,640
I don't want to hear. Especially when he's laughing.

151
00:07:37,470 --> 00:07:38,540
I'm really sorry.

152
00:07:38,540 --> 00:07:40,640
I really need to apologize.

153
00:07:40,570 --> 00:07:42,940
Please, for our sake.

154
00:07:43,410 --> 00:07:46,110
I, worldly acclaimed Heipo, offended

155
00:07:46,110 --> 00:07:49,110
Ms. Nishikawa Ayako, TV talent and surgeon.

156
00:07:49,110 --> 00:07:53,590
I express here, my deepest apology to Ms. Nishikawa.

157
00:07:54,090 --> 00:07:56,450
First I would like to explain how I come to do the act

158
00:07:56,450 --> 00:08:01,130
which, in Ayako's claim, falls into
a sexual harassment...

159
00:08:02,830 --> 00:08:04,260
I'm sorry. Please let me finish.

160
00:08:04,500 --> 00:08:08,200
First I would like to explain how I came to do the act

161
00:08:08,200 --> 00:08:11,200
which, in Ayako's claim, falls into a sexual harassment.

162
00:08:11,200 --> 00:08:14,740
When I try to carry Ayako in the cafe

163
00:08:14,740 --> 00:08:18,440
Ayako's ass made this very erotic move.

164
00:08:18,580 --> 00:08:21,610
So I said to myself "Wow!".

165
00:08:21,610 --> 00:08:23,280
And I grabbed her ass.

166
00:08:23,850 --> 00:08:25,780
Before this shooting began there was
this talk among the staff

167
00:08:25,780 --> 00:08:30,490
that a broad like her can surely take
abuses to some degree.

168
00:08:30,690 --> 00:08:37,630
However, the fact remains that
I grabbed Ms. Ayako's ass.

169
00:08:38,000 --> 00:08:44,440
But it's also a fact that lady doctors, in general,
are thought to be very horny.

170
00:08:44,570 --> 00:08:48,010
Therefore, since both sides are to blame,

171
00:08:48,010 --> 00:08:51,480
I ask you to let bygones be bygones.

172
00:08:52,140 --> 00:08:56,650
The director of Gaki no Tsukai
wordly acclaimed Heipo.
I'm sorry.

173
00:08:58,020 --> 00:09:00,820
I'm sorry. Please give me a seconds chance.

174
00:09:01,190 --> 00:09:07,130
I think his choice of words were
far from appropriate, but...

175
00:09:08,160 --> 00:09:09,590
We are just doing business.

176
00:09:09,260 --> 00:09:10,960
Yes, I understand.

177
00:09:10,960 --> 00:09:12,600
Don't you ever forget it.

178
00:09:11,800 --> 00:09:14,300
I won't. Please forgive me.

179
00:09:13,400 --> 00:09:14,300
OK.

180
00:09:16,070 --> 00:09:18,340
I know it's difficult, but please forget what happened.

181
00:09:16,900 --> 00:09:18,340
I'll try.

182
00:09:19,070 --> 00:09:20,570
Ouch.

183
00:09:23,070 --> 00:09:26,880
The date resumes.

184
00:09:27,710 --> 00:09:29,710
I'm really sorry.

185
00:09:28,080 --> 00:09:29,780
It's alright.

186
00:09:30,680 --> 00:09:32,080
Let's enjoy the time we have.

187
00:09:32,420 --> 00:09:34,190
Yes, please drink a coffee.

188
00:09:32,920 --> 00:09:34,190
Thank you.

189
00:09:34,750 --> 00:09:40,630
I think it's extremely hard for him
to win her heart after this.

190
00:09:40,930 --> 00:09:43,290
Heipo and Ayako's love plan.

191
00:09:42,930 --> 00:09:43,730
Yes.

192
00:09:43,430 --> 00:09:46,300
Do something nice to remember afterward, together.

193
00:09:48,200 --> 00:09:48,970
Wow!

194
00:09:48,970 --> 00:09:51,300
This is a nice. A necklace.

195
00:09:51,300 --> 00:09:53,940
Today's my birthday.

196
00:09:53,770 --> 00:09:54,940
Oh, is it?

197
00:09:54,910 --> 00:09:57,080
It's true.

198
00:09:57,080 --> 00:09:58,280
Can I ask your age?

199
00:09:58,340 --> 00:09:59,610
I'm 35.

200
00:10:00,580 --> 00:10:02,280
35? You looks lot younger!

201
00:10:02,450 --> 00:10:04,400
It's very nice of you. Thank you.

202
00:10:02,650 --> 00:10:05,720
Very beautiful. Very prurient.

203
00:10:05,920 --> 00:10:07,490
Didn't he get the message?

204
00:10:10,690 --> 00:10:13,990
Does he have any idea at all
what his problem had been?

205
00:10:14,430 --> 00:10:17,030
Can I put this on you?

206
00:10:15,790 --> 00:10:17,000
Thank you.

207
00:10:19,100 --> 00:10:20,160
This is sweet.

208
00:10:21,970 --> 00:10:23,670
Oh, it's not...

209
00:10:23,900 --> 00:10:27,470
It's... Your hair...

210
00:10:25,070 --> 00:10:25,840
Yes?

211
00:10:27,370 --> 00:10:28,640
What?

212
00:10:27,470 --> 00:10:29,570
Excuse me, but I have to hook up.

213
00:10:29,910 --> 00:10:31,010
What's he doing?

214
00:10:30,710 --> 00:10:33,110
Stop it!! You Jerk!!

215
00:10:41,790 --> 00:10:45,320
Due to his sexual harassment of her
the shooting was stopped again.

216
00:10:45,920 --> 00:10:47,490
You screwed it big time!

217
00:10:47,390 --> 00:10:48,590
What did I do?

218
00:10:48,360 --> 00:10:50,830
Didn't you get what we were trying to tell you?

219
00:10:50,830 --> 00:10:53,400
I was just trying to put this on her and...

220
00:10:52,800 --> 00:10:55,400
You already told her she's sexy before doing that.

221
00:10:55,770 --> 00:10:57,700
But she smells so good.

222
00:10:57,670 --> 00:10:59,400
What's that got to do with it?

223
00:11:00,040 --> 00:11:02,570
I'll write another letter of apology, really earnestly.

224
00:11:02,570 --> 00:11:04,310
Please give me one more chance.

225
00:11:04,210 --> 00:11:06,540
Don't you ever laugh this time, OK?

226
00:11:06,440 --> 00:11:09,610
I won't, off course. Straight words and straight face.

227
00:11:10,550 --> 00:11:17,120
This is a second offense he made to her.
And he beg her forgiveness for second time.

228
00:11:18,760 --> 00:11:23,060
The question is would she, after all this.

229
00:11:24,430 --> 00:11:24,930
I'm sorry.

230
00:11:29,330 --> 00:11:32,040
We are all sorry for what he did.

231
00:11:31,600 --> 00:11:32,740
I'm very sorry.

232
00:11:32,970 --> 00:11:35,270
Heipo, just get to it.

233
00:11:34,610 --> 00:11:35,210
Yes.

234
00:11:36,110 --> 00:11:38,880
I wrote another letter. Please listen.

235
00:11:37,910 --> 00:11:39,310
I don't want to hear it.

236
00:11:38,880 --> 00:11:41,510
Just give me one more chance, please.

237
00:11:41,350 --> 00:11:45,550
Ms. Nishikawa, I would like you to give it a try.

238
00:11:46,450 --> 00:11:48,650
After that it's up to you to decide.

239
00:11:49,050 --> 00:11:51,420
OK.

240
00:11:53,290 --> 00:11:55,090
Before I express my deepest apology,

241
00:11:55,090 --> 00:12:01,470
I would like to explain how I came to do that act.

242
00:12:01,870 --> 00:12:07,810
It's said that in adult entertainment establishment
in Ikebukuro average fee is from 30,000 to 50,000 yen.

243
00:12:08,110 --> 00:12:11,980
Therefore when I thought about expensive
performance fee we paid you.

244
00:12:11,980 --> 00:12:16,950
Pressing myself to you hardly seems excessive.

245
00:12:16,950 --> 00:12:19,450
This is the reasoning behind my conduct.

246
00:12:20,320 --> 00:12:28,590
What's more, when I pressed myself to her.
Her expression was not that of a rejection
but that of a lecherous joy.

247
00:12:28,590 --> 00:12:33,130
So the waves of "Wow, this is good" kept coming to me.

248
00:12:33,130 --> 00:12:37,470
Which eventually leads to my pushing her down.

249
00:12:38,240 --> 00:12:42,270
So if I describe this incident in more vulgar terms.

250
00:12:42,270 --> 00:12:45,210
It's like I was so excited in adult
entertainment establishment

251
00:12:45,210 --> 00:12:48,810
that I forced a worker to have sex with me,
which is not in the options of the service.

252
00:12:48,810 --> 00:12:51,720
So I didn't feel any moral qualm when I did it.

253
00:12:51,720 --> 00:12:57,220
There fore I ask you to agree to settle this out of court.

254
00:12:57,260 --> 00:13:00,630
The director of the show, worldly acclaimed Heipo.

255
00:13:00,760 --> 00:13:02,790
Please forgive me...

256
00:13:06,430 --> 00:13:08,100
We are sorry too.

257
00:13:07,630 --> 00:13:09,100
I'm sorry.

258
00:13:10,270 --> 00:13:14,140
His choice of words, again, is very lousy.

259
00:13:14,740 --> 00:13:17,310
But he's really sorry for what happened.

260
00:13:16,010 --> 00:13:17,240
I am.

261
00:13:17,940 --> 00:13:20,440
How could you call tha an apology?

262
00:13:19,580 --> 00:13:20,650
You can't.

263
00:13:20,650 --> 00:13:23,610
We ourselves are surprised to hear that.

264
00:13:23,980 --> 00:13:25,820
I don't want to do this.

265
00:13:25,820 --> 00:13:26,750
Please.

266
00:13:28,090 --> 00:13:31,420
Would you please give me another chance?

267
00:13:32,460 --> 00:13:34,590
For Hamada-san's sake too.

268
00:13:32,560 --> 00:13:34,530
I really don't.

269
00:13:35,390 --> 00:13:37,160
I can't do it any more.

270
00:13:38,930 --> 00:13:43,530
Nishikawa completely lost her patience this time
and called the producer of the show.

271
00:13:44,170 --> 00:13:47,440
Can we continue the shooting?

272
00:13:48,240 --> 00:13:50,210
What's this? "Before I express my apology"?

273
00:13:50,210 --> 00:13:51,810
Apology first!

274
00:13:52,040 --> 00:13:53,140
Oh, I should?

275
00:13:53,850 --> 00:13:56,650
Why you mentioned entertainment establishment?

276
00:13:58,850 --> 00:14:01,850
So I should do this for my own benefit?

277
00:14:02,150 --> 00:14:06,290
After a desperate appeal, the producer
managed to make her agree to continue.

278
00:14:06,660 --> 00:14:08,230
I'll do it.

279
00:14:07,690 --> 00:14:08,630
Thank you.

280
00:14:08,360 --> 00:14:10,800
I'm very sorry. And thank you.

281
00:14:11,260 --> 00:14:13,900
I will do it right.

282
00:14:11,960 --> 00:14:13,560
You really should.

283
00:14:21,670 --> 00:14:25,640
Restart

284
00:14:26,080 --> 00:14:29,410
Many things happened today, but I enjoyed it.

285
00:14:29,410 --> 00:14:32,520
Thank you. It's been the moment of my life.

286
00:14:29,480 --> 00:14:30,080
Yes.

287
00:14:30,080 --> 00:14:31,620
Thank you.

288
00:14:31,620 --> 00:14:33,480
I enjoyed it too.

289
00:14:33,220 --> 00:14:35,250
Did you? Thank you.

290
00:14:35,250 --> 00:14:35,520
Yes.

291
00:14:35,450 --> 00:14:37,760
Mr. and Ms. this is for you.

292
00:14:38,090 --> 00:14:38,960
Thank you.

293
00:14:39,660 --> 00:14:41,260
A lovely kid.

294
00:14:40,160 --> 00:14:41,160
Cute.

295
00:14:41,460 --> 00:14:43,690
What's in this box?

296
00:14:43,900 --> 00:14:46,560
Oh, another letter.

297
00:14:47,160 --> 00:14:53,670
The guy confesses his love to the girl loudly
and kiss her through this glass.

298
00:14:54,040 --> 00:14:56,310
So I hold this in front of your mouth?

299
00:14:56,140 --> 00:14:57,810
Oh, through glass.

300
00:14:56,710 --> 00:14:58,480
Like this, I think.

301
00:14:58,510 --> 00:15:00,040
Just do the thing, Heipo.

302
00:15:00,310 --> 00:15:02,210
All he have to do is just to follow the instruction.

303
00:15:02,250 --> 00:15:03,810
May I begin?

304
00:15:03,920 --> 00:15:04,750
Yes.

305
00:15:05,950 --> 00:15:09,050
I couldn't express how sorry I am for all the things.

306
00:15:09,050 --> 00:15:12,090
I'm so sorry for all the offenses.

307
00:15:12,360 --> 00:15:16,760
Still, I enjoyed every minute and
had a excitement of romance.

308
00:15:16,760 --> 00:15:20,830
So if you don't mind, please marry me!

309
00:15:20,330 --> 00:15:21,670
Marry him?

310
00:15:22,130 --> 00:15:23,530
Hey, please.

311
00:15:24,200 --> 00:15:25,770
Use the glass.

312
00:15:26,300 --> 00:15:27,370
What are you doing?

313
00:15:27,370 --> 00:15:28,640
No, no.

314
00:15:28,270 --> 00:15:30,110
Glass, where is it?

315
00:15:29,370 --> 00:15:30,780
No. Really.

316
00:15:30,980 --> 00:15:32,710
Stop it!

317
00:15:32,380 --> 00:15:33,810
He's grabbing her ass.

318
00:15:33,810 --> 00:15:36,950
I mean it. No!

319
00:15:37,010 --> 00:15:38,720
Ouch. Ouch!

320
00:15:38,720 --> 00:15:40,790
Why are you doing this!

321
00:15:38,850 --> 00:15:41,490
She slapped back of his head.

322
00:15:42,150 --> 00:15:43,960
Don't you get it?!

323
00:15:45,160 --> 00:15:46,560
Why he's laughing?

324
00:15:47,560 --> 00:15:49,190
That hurts.

325
00:15:47,730 --> 00:15:49,160
That's way out of line.

326
00:15:50,630 --> 00:15:51,330
Pervert!

327
00:15:50,630 --> 00:15:53,500
He's slapped and kicked and crying like a child.

328
00:15:55,470 --> 00:15:56,870
What should I do?

329
00:15:59,000 --> 00:16:02,640
We have to stop the shooting for the 3rd time
because of the sexual harassment.

330
00:16:05,510 --> 00:16:06,940
Don't you ever learn?

331
00:16:07,810 --> 00:16:08,950
Learn what?

332
00:16:09,650 --> 00:16:13,050
I expressed my love very affectionately.

333
00:16:13,050 --> 00:16:15,890
The letter said you have to use this glass.

334
00:16:16,320 --> 00:16:18,790
But Ayako seems ready for it.

335
00:16:18,790 --> 00:16:20,360
Don't talk like she's your girlfriend.

336
00:16:21,560 --> 00:16:23,460
You've only referred to her by Ayako so far.

337
00:16:23,460 --> 00:16:25,400
And only adjective you use to describe her was 'sexy'.

338
00:16:28,330 --> 00:16:31,570
Heipo, I'm afraid we can't help you any more.

339
00:16:33,200 --> 00:16:35,640
I'll write another letter for one last time.

340
00:16:35,210 --> 00:16:36,710
That wouldn't work.

341
00:16:37,070 --> 00:16:38,680
That's just wouldn't work.

342
00:16:39,110 --> 00:16:42,350
Your letters were complete disaster.

343
00:16:42,550 --> 00:16:44,350
Can't call that an apology.

344
00:16:44,350 --> 00:16:47,220
Don't worry. I'll write in sincerely.

345
00:16:46,750 --> 00:16:48,190
Very arrogant.

346
00:16:48,190 --> 00:16:50,450
Just remember you can't expect her to forgive you.

347
00:16:50,450 --> 00:16:53,690
We'll only ask her to listen.

348
00:16:53,690 --> 00:17:26,660
no sub

349
00:17:29,230 --> 00:17:34,430
This could easily lead to a lawsuit.

350
00:17:35,030 --> 00:17:38,640
Is it possible to ask her forgiveness this time?

351
00:17:48,680 --> 00:17:50,680
I just want to say that...

352
00:17:51,220 --> 00:17:55,850
We are not come here to ask your forgiveness.

353
00:17:55,850 --> 00:17:59,390
We came here to ask you to listen
to him for one last time.

354
00:17:59,490 --> 00:18:02,660
I wrote another letter so...

355
00:18:02,660 --> 00:18:04,500
Please listen...

356
00:18:09,370 --> 00:18:10,970
I want you to listen...

357
00:18:10,000 --> 00:18:12,700
Why are you laughing, huh?

358
00:18:13,740 --> 00:18:15,440
Do you have any idea who rude that is?

359
00:18:13,740 --> 00:18:15,610
No! What are you going to do to me!

360
00:18:19,210 --> 00:18:20,950
What's so funny?

361
00:18:20,240 --> 00:18:21,150
I'm sorry.

362
00:18:21,750 --> 00:18:26,120
I'm sorry for what I've done. Please just listen.

363
00:18:26,180 --> 00:18:27,080
Just do it!

364
00:18:27,150 --> 00:18:28,290
Thank you.

365
00:18:30,790 --> 00:18:35,690
I would like to thank you for taking time for 3rd time.

366
00:18:36,330 --> 00:18:39,030
I thought kissing a talent of your class is no big deal.

367
00:18:39,030 --> 00:18:43,100
That was very thoughtless of me.

368
00:18:43,130 --> 00:18:45,100
And I apologize for the offenses.

369
00:18:45,670 --> 00:18:49,140
This thing originated when Ayako
came for the shooting.

370
00:18:49,140 --> 00:18:55,010
I thought to myself "Here comes a major bitch!"

371
00:18:55,750 --> 00:18:57,980
Let me mention for a moment here about the word.

372
00:18:59,650 --> 00:19:03,450
The word 'bitch' means a slut who sleeps with anybody.

373
00:19:03,690 --> 00:19:07,220
So when I think of that during the shooting

374
00:19:07,220 --> 00:19:10,790
waves of "Wow, this is good" kept coming to me.

375
00:19:10,790 --> 00:19:17,430
I couldn't resist the 5th and I set out to kiss you.

376
00:19:18,470 --> 00:19:23,610
What's more, during the shooting you gave off an
awesome 'pheromone'.

377
00:19:23,910 --> 00:19:26,080
Which doesn't match a cheesy talent like you at all.

378
00:19:26,680 --> 00:19:29,950
So I thought to myself "she's a dirty old slut"

379
00:19:30,380 --> 00:19:34,450
and also thought *******

380
00:19:34,790 --> 00:19:38,520
That leads me eventually to set out to
kiss you for the 2nd and the 3rd time.

381
00:19:39,220 --> 00:19:42,230
This whole thing taught me a valuable lesson.

382
00:19:42,230 --> 00:19:47,630
That I can't force someone to kiss me,
even that someone is a talent of your class.

383
00:19:47,870 --> 00:19:50,770
The director of the show, worldly acclaimed Heipo.

384
00:19:50,900 --> 00:19:52,300
I'm sorry.

385
00:19:55,370 --> 00:19:59,310
Obviously this wouldn't work.

386
00:19:59,080 --> 00:20:02,450
But I did the best I could to show my sincerity...

387
00:20:03,380 --> 00:20:05,350
There's no way you can call that sincere.

388
00:20:04,780 --> 00:20:06,480
I think it's well expressed.

389
00:20:06,480 --> 00:20:07,690
What on earth are you trying to do?

390
00:20:07,690 --> 00:20:08,850
What is this?

391
00:20:08,890 --> 00:20:11,920
I.. went on for so long...

392
00:20:12,260 --> 00:20:14,460
I'm sick of this crap!

393
00:20:13,560 --> 00:20:16,060
We are sorry. We understand your feeling.

394
00:20:16,630 --> 00:20:19,530
We considered what can we do to make up.

395
00:20:19,530 --> 00:20:21,630
So we brought this.

396
00:20:19,900 --> 00:20:22,000
A whip for S&M

397
00:20:22,370 --> 00:20:25,270
You can release your anger with this.

398
00:20:27,170 --> 00:20:28,970
But I had apologized.

399
00:20:28,970 --> 00:20:30,980
She hasn't forgive you.

400
00:20:31,610 --> 00:20:33,680
On your knees. Now!

401
00:20:34,180 --> 00:20:35,710
I said on your knees!

402
00:20:34,810 --> 00:20:36,380
Oh! Yes!

403
00:20:37,250 --> 00:20:38,850
What?

404
00:20:38,420 --> 00:20:40,520
Don't you get up!

405
00:20:41,350 --> 00:20:43,290
Head down!

406
00:20:45,190 --> 00:20:46,520
Oh, no!

407
00:20:49,390 --> 00:20:50,790
Yes.

408
00:20:52,030 --> 00:20:53,630
I want a real apology!

409
00:20:53,960 --> 00:20:56,130
Oh, yes! Sorry!

410
00:20:54,730 --> 00:20:56,300
Give me a real apology!

411
00:21:01,670 --> 00:21:04,040
Here comes a major bitch.

412
00:21:04,710 --> 00:21:07,650
A broad like her can certainly take abuses to some degree.

413
00:21:08,780 --> 00:21:12,950
Lady doctors, in general, are thought to be very horny.

414
00:21:12,950 --> 00:21:16,690
Her 'pheromone' was so awesome for
a piece of cheesy ass.

415
00:21:16,720 --> 00:21:19,690
Wave of "Wow, this is good" kept coming to me.

416
00:21:20,890 --> 00:21:23,530
Pressing myself to her hardly seems excessive.

417
00:21:25,000 --> 00:21:28,000
This whole thing taught me a valuable lesson.

418
00:21:28,000 --> 00:21:31,400
That I can't force someone to kiss me,
even that someone is a talent of your class.
