1
00:00:00,160 --> 00:00:03,130
4th Time on Gaki No Tsukai!

2
00:00:02,100 --> 00:00:04,160
The 4th time huh?

3
00:00:03,130 --> 00:00:09,260
"Are their hearts connected?" No Smartphone Meetup!

4
00:00:04,710 --> 00:00:06,780
This is the 4th time?

5
00:00:07,240 --> 00:00:09,260
This is the 4th time?

6
00:00:09,860 --> 00:00:11,890
I was speaking

7
00:00:11,890 --> 00:00:14,230
The 4th time
What do you guys think?

8
00:00:14,230 --> 00:00:17,860
It takes us 3 hours on average to meet up

9
00:00:14,500 --> 00:00:17,860
Yeah...

10
00:00:16,100 --> 00:00:17,860
It does take time

11
00:00:18,500 --> 00:00:24,000
The 4th installment of a series designed to test the bonds between these 5

12
00:00:24,630 --> 00:00:32,060
The Rule: The head to a location using the theme on the card. If they all meetup then they succeed

13
00:00:33,630 --> 00:00:40,090
Looking at the past 3 episodes, it seems one man is always dragging everyone behind

14
00:00:40,090 --> 00:00:42,560
Well I didn't wanna say this, but in the end,

15
00:00:42,560 --> 00:00:47,490
Things would go better if Tanaka wasn't here

16
00:00:45,730 --> 00:00:49,200
No come on, maybe for the first one I'm slow,

17
00:00:49,200 --> 00:00:51,500
- Is what I said when I entered Yoshimoto

18
00:00:52,530 --> 00:00:56,730
If this asshole wasn't with us, Yoshimoto wouldn't be in such a state

19
00:00:54,930 --> 00:00:57,060
It wouldn't, it would improve immediately

20
00:00:55,230 --> 00:00:58,330
It's just my recent performance!

21
00:00:57,060 --> 00:01:01,200
The conducter gets pissed off when this guy boards the bullet train

22
00:01:02,100 --> 00:01:05,060
Right away, the first theme is announced

23
00:01:05,060 --> 00:01:07,560
Here I go, ready ... go

24
00:01:09,330 --> 00:01:11,500
A famous bridge intersection

25
00:01:10,160 --> 00:01:11,500
This one is hard

26
00:01:11,500 --> 00:01:14,900
SomethingOrOther-Bridge?

27
00:01:12,430 --> 00:01:16,120
There is one! There is one!

28
00:01:16,120 --> 00:01:19,060
Well starting from here, I don't think it's that far away

29
00:01:19,060 --> 00:01:21,260
Well, we do have a 30 minute limit

30
00:01:21,260 --> 00:01:24,830
Why do you have such a troubled face?!

31
00:01:24,830 --> 00:01:28,730
TN: Numazu is 1.5 hours away from Tokyo

32
00:01:24,830 --> 00:01:28,730
You went to Numazu in your head right?

33
00:01:29,260 --> 00:01:37,400
A bridge intersection; Near NTV in Kojimachi, there are around 150 examples

34
00:01:37,400 --> 00:01:40,000
Do you think you'll meet anyone, at this point?

35
00:01:40,000 --> 00:01:43,600
I think Matsumoto-san might come to this one place

36
00:01:44,200 --> 00:01:47,730
Matsumoto-san and I do have a memory of there

37
00:01:47,730 --> 00:01:50,890
Oh really? A memory about an intersection?

38
00:01:49,030 --> 00:01:50,890
There is!

39
00:01:51,060 --> 00:01:54,360
Sorry! I don't have a single memory with Endo

40
00:01:54,630 --> 00:01:57,300
It was from over 20 years ago

41
00:01:54,960 --> 00:01:57,300
Let's not do that kind of thing

42
00:01:58,100 --> 00:02:02,000
Endo is the first to head off

43
00:02:02,500 --> 00:02:05,300
I wonder if they'll come

44
00:02:07,030 --> 00:02:07,960
Alright

45
00:02:08,100 --> 00:02:10,830
No memories with Endo

46
00:02:10,830 --> 00:02:16,580
On New Year's, he sends a text with some message like "I'll follow you!" right?

47
00:02:17,300 --> 00:02:19,800
He does!

48
00:02:17,300 --> 00:02:20,760
It's so fake right?

49
00:02:18,060 --> 00:02:20,760
Exactly!

50
00:02:20,760 --> 00:02:25,230
He also sent me something like "Senpai, I'll always follow you!", so passionate

51
00:02:25,230 --> 00:02:26,600
What a liar!

52
00:02:26,800 --> 00:02:29,800
Really, he's lying?

53
00:02:28,660 --> 00:02:30,100
He's lying!

54
00:02:30,500 --> 00:02:32,960
They have 30 minutes,

55
00:02:32,960 --> 00:02:37,060
They start heading off to the places they came up with

56
00:02:37,860 --> 00:02:41,600
And Endo, who's relying on a memory with Matsumoto?

57
00:02:41,600 --> 00:02:43,560
Yamate-dori

58
00:02:43,560 --> 00:02:48,400
The intersection ... It wasn't Miyamae-bashi... (Miyamae-bridge)

59
00:02:48,400 --> 00:02:52,800
Nope! I got it wrong, it was Matsumi-zaka (a hill)

60
00:02:50,660 --> 00:02:52,800
It was an intersection with Matsumi-zaka?

61
00:02:52,800 --> 00:02:56,030
I got it wrong, it wasn't a bridge

62
00:02:56,030 --> 00:02:58,130
I'm definitely not meeting Matsumoto-san

63
00:02:58,700 --> 00:03:02,100
Endo mistook a hill for a bridge

64
00:03:02,100 --> 00:03:05,700
Matsumoto-san used to live near there right?

65
00:03:03,200 --> 00:03:06,460
Yeah, and also near there...

66
00:03:06,460 --> 00:03:12,970
There was an intersection with Matsumi-zaka, and he dropped me off there

67
00:03:12,970 --> 00:03:16,700
That place in front of Komaba Campus with the air conditioner?

68
00:03:14,160 --> 00:03:16,700
Yes, yes

69
00:03:18,760 --> 00:03:24,260
Just where is Endo heading?

70
00:03:25,160 --> 00:03:29,700
And what about Matsumoto, who usually meets up first?

71
00:03:30,360 --> 00:03:34,760
Y'know, let's try out Akabono-bashi

72
00:03:35,300 --> 00:03:38,560
There's also Suido-bashi right?

73
00:03:37,360 --> 00:03:39,000
Yes indeed

74
00:03:39,500 --> 00:03:43,360
And we've recorded there a lot right?

75
00:03:43,660 --> 00:03:48,130
I got it, Mr. Driver excuse me,

76
00:03:48,130 --> 00:03:49,930
Suidobashi please

77
00:03:49,930 --> 00:03:53,230
Yes, Suidobashi Intersection

78
00:03:53,930 --> 00:03:57,630
I think at least one person?

79
00:03:58,660 --> 00:04:05,960
I think Hamada might head to Akebonobashi....

80
00:04:06,430 --> 00:04:16,200
That time we met at Akebonobashi, in front of Fuji TV,

81
00:04:16,200 --> 00:04:21,360
I think there might be a memory of that

82
00:04:22,130 --> 00:04:26,000
And that Hamada was still deliberating

83
00:04:26,260 --> 00:04:29,500
I hate this....

84
00:04:31,060 --> 00:04:35,130
I hate this series...

85
00:04:36,130 --> 00:04:42,060
Meanwhile, Tanaka, who always makes everyone wait for him...

86
00:04:42,060 --> 00:04:44,560
I have no idea, honestly

87
00:04:45,300 --> 00:04:48,400
I have a bad feeling about my idea

88
00:04:49,160 --> 00:04:53,230
For now, he gets into the Taxi and plans his destination

89
00:04:53,400 --> 00:04:58,500
The first one that came to mind ... It's that one, uh,

90
00:04:58,640 --> 00:04:59,640
Secret

91
00:04:59,640 --> 00:05:01,400
Ah, I see

92
00:05:01,400 --> 00:05:07,300
I feel like there's a more prevalent intersection with a bridge

93
00:05:07,860 --> 00:05:11,460
In Shibuya, they have that ... "Scrambled Egg" I think it's called

94
00:05:11,760 --> 00:05:14,130
Wait no, what was it called again?

95
00:05:14,130 --> 00:05:19,030
C'mon stop that

96
00:05:19,030 --> 00:05:26,810
And the distance too, I want to pick a place that's not too far away

97
00:05:25,060 --> 00:05:26,810
That's true

98
00:05:27,500 --> 00:05:32,100
Taking distance into consideration, what place did Tanaka come up with?

99
00:05:32,100 --> 00:05:33,000
I'm getting in

100
00:05:33,000 --> 00:05:38,330
And what about Hosei, who's not lived in Tokyo for 4 years?

101
00:05:38,330 --> 00:05:43,230
Eh? Hold on, was that place in Shibuya called Miaymasu-bashi?

102
00:05:43,230 --> 00:05:45,800
I think it's Miyamasu-Zaka
Zaka huh?

103
00:05:45,800 --> 00:05:48,200
There's no Miyamasu-bashi

104
00:05:48,460 --> 00:05:52,930
Eh hold on- Namiki-bashi! Namiki-bashi intersection

105
00:05:53,460 --> 00:05:59,430
There's the JRA, the Ramen store,

106
00:05:59,660 --> 00:06:03,360
A ramen place on Meiji-dori, I think it was called Fumaibo?

107
00:06:03,360 --> 00:06:11,360
That person, I can't remember his name, that guy from Hollywood

108
00:06:11,760 --> 00:06:14,660
It's a ramen place that actor guy likes

109
00:06:14,660 --> 00:06:18,130
Alright, the ramen store that guy likes

110
00:06:18,400 --> 00:06:20,630
Let's head right here

111
00:06:20,630 --> 00:06:24,200
I got a good one! A really good one!

112
00:06:24,730 --> 00:06:28,630
Hosei heads towards Namiki-bashi intersection

113
00:06:29,560 --> 00:06:33,560
Matsumoto, heading towards Suidobashi, remembers something from his youth

114
00:06:33,700 --> 00:06:37,160
Do you remember Korakuen Hall?

115
00:06:37,160 --> 00:06:41,900
They shot the show "Owarai Star Tanjou!!" there

116
00:06:41,900 --> 00:06:48,560
So we'd get off at the station, walk to Korakuen Hall, and practice our material

117
00:06:48,560 --> 00:06:52,960
If anyone comes, it would be Hamada I think

118
00:06:53,830 --> 00:07:01,040
But for Hamada, things like "Owarai Star Tanjou!!", and other stuff that's from the past,

119
00:07:02,330 --> 00:07:05,240
He really doesn't remember them

120
00:07:06,200 --> 00:07:12,230
Hamada, a man with poor memory, heads off without deciding a destination

121
00:07:12,860 --> 00:07:15,200
Nothing at all?

122
00:07:17,600 --> 00:07:19,300
Ah!

123
00:07:19,700 --> 00:07:21,160
I got it!

124
00:07:21,900 --> 00:07:26,500
There's gotta be only one answer for this,

125
00:07:27,430 --> 00:07:30,130
Where is Hamada headed?

126
00:07:30,630 --> 00:07:36,030
This one, I got it - What's the first place that comes to mind when you think of Japan?

127
00:07:36,400 --> 00:07:39,930
Please head to Nihon-bashi (Japan-bridge)

128
00:07:38,200 --> 00:07:39,930
Understood

129
00:07:40,360 --> 00:07:42,800
The "Wings of a Qilin"

130
00:07:45,360 --> 00:07:49,030
This is the only answer! Everyone will head there!

131
00:07:49,030 --> 00:07:51,380
Makes sense

132
00:07:49,930 --> 00:07:51,380
Right?!

133
00:07:51,380 --> 00:07:58,130
What other options could there possibly be? What if they complain...

134
00:08:00,460 --> 00:08:05,930
With 3 people likely to meet, all 5 have decided their destinations

135
00:08:06,600 --> 00:08:10,900
Will anyone be able to meet up?

136
00:08:10,900 --> 00:08:16,770
Downtown no Gaki no Tsukai ya Arahende!!

137
00:08:10,900 --> 00:08:16,770
Timed and Typeset by Kedomas
Translation by senor_wristband

138
00:08:16,910 --> 00:08:22,880
Matsumoto screams for some reason
Are their hearts connected?

139
00:08:23,660 --> 00:08:28,660
Are their hearts connected? No Smartphone Meetup!

140
00:08:28,660 --> 00:08:33,260
The theme; a typical bridge intersection

141
00:08:34,130 --> 00:08:39,800
Endo, the first one to head off, arrives at his chosen intersection

142
00:08:40,160 --> 00:08:42,500
It's huge!

143
00:08:43,930 --> 00:08:46,300
Where should I stand?

144
00:08:46,300 --> 00:08:48,730
Iidabashi intersection

145
00:08:49,000 --> 00:08:51,630
Suidobashi is over there right?

146
00:08:51,630 --> 00:08:56,330
You know, I did consider Suidobashi

147
00:08:56,860 --> 00:09:00,060
But I picked Iidabashi over Suidobashi

148
00:09:00,360 --> 00:09:02,900
And right in front of Endo...

149
00:09:02,900 --> 00:09:04,830
Well certainly, that is true

150
00:09:04,830 --> 00:09:07,560
He encounters Matsumoto, heading towards Suidobashi

151
00:09:07,630 --> 00:09:11,530
This is the Iidabashi intersection

152
00:09:09,760 --> 00:09:11,830
Right

153
00:09:12,830 --> 00:09:19,000
I don;t think have any memories at Iidabashi intersection

154
00:09:20,500 --> 00:09:23,460
However Endo once again misses...

155
00:09:23,630 --> 00:09:28,830
And doesn't notice Matsumoto passing by him to Suidobashi

156
00:09:28,830 --> 00:09:32,900
Oh right, Iidabashi could've been an option

157
00:09:34,500 --> 00:09:40,530
Then Hosei arrives at his chosen intersection in Shibuya; Namikibashi Intesection

158
00:09:41,760 --> 00:09:47,430
Ah, wow! Look how clearly you can see the name

159
00:09:47,430 --> 00:09:49,860
Namikibashi~

160
00:09:49,860 --> 00:09:54,060
Ah, Santouka! The place I was talking about before

161
00:09:54,060 --> 00:09:59,830
I remember everything now! Keanu Reeves loves that place

162
00:10:00,360 --> 00:10:03,760
Yeah, Keanu Reeves loves that place

163
00:10:04,960 --> 00:10:09,830
Matsumoto gets off at Suidobashi intersection

164
00:10:11,460 --> 00:10:15,660
Surely they won't come out of the water, right?

165
00:10:16,560 --> 00:10:19,430
Just zipping down there

166
00:10:24,300 --> 00:10:26,330
They're not coming!

167
00:10:26,730 --> 00:10:29,230
Idiots!

168
00:10:30,300 --> 00:10:33,960
Meanwhile, Hamada arrives at Nihonbashi

169
00:10:33,980 --> 00:10:38,100
It's written very clearly "The First Bridge In Japan"

170
00:10:38,100 --> 00:10:41,300
This is the start isn't it?

171
00:10:41,860 --> 00:10:46,660
Oi, they're not here! What's the meaning of this?

172
00:10:47,130 --> 00:10:52,030
That's where Nakai Kiichi fainted isn't it?!

173
00:10:54,760 --> 00:10:59,100
Eh? you gotta be kidding me....

174
00:11:00,160 --> 00:11:04,200
Everyone but Tanaka has arrived at their location

175
00:11:04,930 --> 00:11:09,300
Matsumoto has already been waiting for 10 minutes

176
00:11:11,300 --> 00:11:13,600
This is hopeless!

177
00:11:16,600 --> 00:11:18,460
Tanaka is the only one still in transit

178
00:11:18,460 --> 00:11:21,000
COME ON!

179
00:11:21,030 --> 00:11:23,960
DAMMIT~!!

180
00:11:25,430 --> 00:11:29,000
DId you hear that? Tanaka is still driving!

181
00:11:29,000 --> 00:11:33,160
Well, it would be nice to end this early

182
00:11:33,430 --> 00:11:35,330
Before the mood drops?

183
00:11:35,330 --> 00:11:38,130
Right, yes

184
00:11:38,400 --> 00:11:43,960
Everyone will be happy, the cast, the staff, everyone

185
00:11:44,300 --> 00:11:47,900
That guy really is a pain

186
00:11:48,560 --> 00:11:51,860
Cause it's fine if he had the wrong idea...

187
00:11:52,200 --> 00:11:57,160
But I mean, making your senior wait for this long?

188
00:11:58,530 --> 00:12:03,460
Tanaka arrives to his destination, and obviously nobody else is there

189
00:12:03,460 --> 00:12:05,270
Time Up

190
00:12:08,930 --> 00:12:10,900
No way...

191
00:12:11,360 --> 00:12:15,560
The 5 call each other to confirm their locations

192
00:12:16,230 --> 00:12:18,160
Hamada where are you?

193
00:12:18,600 --> 00:12:22,160
The start of Japan! Nihonbashi of course!

194
00:12:22,160 --> 00:12:25,300
"The start of Japan"?

195
00:12:23,160 --> 00:12:25,300
NIHONBASHI?!

196
00:12:25,700 --> 00:12:27,700
SO FAR!

197
00:12:27,900 --> 00:12:31,200
It's not far! It's right ahead of Ginza, it's right there

198
00:12:31,200 --> 00:12:34,830
Also, Nihonbashi is a pretty high-end district,

199
00:12:34,830 --> 00:12:36,300
Yeah it's a high-end district

200
00:12:36,300 --> 00:12:40,160
I think they wouldn't want Hamada there

201
00:12:41,930 --> 00:12:44,260
Why wouldn't they want me here?

202
00:12:44,260 --> 00:12:47,700
It's gotta be Suidobashi intersection!

203
00:12:47,700 --> 00:12:51,300
Ah! He said Suidobashi, it's right there!

204
00:12:51,300 --> 00:12:53,530
Come on!

205
00:12:53,530 --> 00:12:56,600
Hamada-san! Hamada-san

206
00:12:56,600 --> 00:13:04,960
If you remember the auditions for "Owarai Star Tanjou", and the filiming as well, you'd come here

207
00:13:05,100 --> 00:13:07,130
Korakuen Hall, right?!

208
00:13:07,130 --> 00:13:13,330
Let's not use reasons like that. I mean, even if you say that...

209
00:13:13,730 --> 00:13:15,800
Hosei-san, Hosei-san where are you?

210
00:13:15,800 --> 00:13:18,000
Namikibashi

211
00:13:18,000 --> 00:13:21,360
I aplogise, to the people involved with Naimikibashi I apologise,

212
00:13:21,360 --> 00:13:24,300
Naimikibashi, is pathetic

213
00:13:24,800 --> 00:13:28,260
Hold on, it's not pathetic!

214
00:13:28,460 --> 00:13:31,430
I am at Iidabashi

215
00:13:31,430 --> 00:13:33,060
Iidabashi?

216
00:13:33,060 --> 00:13:36,430
I get it Endo! You're really close by

217
00:13:36,430 --> 00:13:38,730
What was that memory with Matsumoto-san?

218
00:13:38,730 --> 00:13:44,030
It wasn't a bridge, it was a hill, it was Matsumi-zaka. I got it mixed up, sorry

219
00:13:44,030 --> 00:13:46,830
Enough! It's cold so hurry up Tanaka! Idiot!

220
00:13:47,230 --> 00:13:50,200
Ike- ikejiri-ohashi - Oh -
Ikejiri-ohashi!

221
00:13:50,430 --> 00:13:52,700
Ikejiri-ohashi?!

222
00:13:53,730 --> 00:13:55,560
Seriously??

223
00:13:55,560 --> 00:13:58,900
No no no no no no no no no Enough!

224
00:13:58,900 --> 00:14:02,030
Tanaka has the worst idea, after all

225
00:14:02,430 --> 00:14:08,030
Tanaka was the only one who thought of an overhead bridge crossing; Ikejiri-ohashi

226
00:14:08,660 --> 00:14:11,760
Enough of that area of yours

227
00:14:11,760 --> 00:14:14,760
No no no it's a huge intersection!

228
00:14:14,760 --> 00:14:18,700
Let's meet up at the next one!

229
00:14:16,230 --> 00:14:18,700
Let's meet up!

230
00:14:18,700 --> 00:14:20,900
Tanaka is at Ohashi...

231
00:14:20,900 --> 00:14:23,030
Ohashi?!
Right?

232
00:14:23,030 --> 00:14:25,300
Tanaka really is different

233
00:14:25,300 --> 00:14:28,330
But it should'be been here!

234
00:14:28,330 --> 00:14:32,430
If you think about the metro area, and the distance as well

235
00:14:32,430 --> 00:14:37,430
Is it really possible nobody came to this major intersection?

236
00:14:38,100 --> 00:14:42,000
Nobody met up with the first theme!

237
00:14:42,960 --> 00:14:47,030
Starting over, time for the 2nd theme

238
00:14:48,930 --> 00:14:52,460
Oi! What the hell is this?

239
00:14:52,460 --> 00:14:55,630
A place with a lot of autograph plaques?

240
00:14:56,360 --> 00:15:00,960
You can find autograph plaques of celebrities on the walls of restaurants,

241
00:15:01,260 --> 00:15:06,960
The 5 think of a place that fits this desciption best

242
00:15:07,260 --> 00:15:09,830
I can only think of that one place

243
00:15:10,160 --> 00:15:14,300
That's the only place I can associate with famous people

244
00:15:14,300 --> 00:15:19,600
There's one that I though of immediately, it's in Asakusa

245
00:15:20,800 --> 00:15:25,100
But I think distance-wise, that's a difficult choice

246
00:15:25,300 --> 00:15:28,230
This is so hard

247
00:15:28,230 --> 00:15:31,000
Have you ever put up your autograph?

248
00:15:31,360 --> 00:15:36,630
I can't really remember, what stores I've done that in

249
00:15:36,860 --> 00:15:44,460
TN: Hihokan is a sex museum

250
00:15:36,860 --> 00:15:44,460
The only place I can remember being asked for my autograph is the Hihokan in Atami

251
00:15:45,630 --> 00:15:50,160
Ah, there's one place I went to on a shoot, I just remembered

252
00:15:50,500 --> 00:15:53,430
I was on a shoot with Shimura-san

253
00:15:53,430 --> 00:15:56,630
A Blowfish restaurant in Azabujunban

254
00:15:56,830 --> 00:16:00,700
"The Earth was Blue" - Gagarin! They had Gagarin's autograph

255
00:16:02,460 --> 00:16:09,130
On different TV shows I've done segments on this topic,

256
00:16:09,130 --> 00:16:14,200
About stores that have lots of autographs

257
00:16:14,200 --> 00:16:19,860
I know a lot of places, I can't really narrow it down right now

258
00:16:20,300 --> 00:16:25,800
Endo has so many options he can't narrow them down

259
00:16:27,130 --> 00:16:30,100
Will we really meet up for this one?

260
00:16:30,360 --> 00:16:33,030
There's one place...

261
00:16:33,630 --> 00:16:36,860
Ah no, that's not it

262
00:16:42,160 --> 00:16:44,360
Kamukura, right?

263
00:16:44,660 --> 00:16:47,400
Yeah Kamukura, let's go to Kamukura

264
00:16:48,560 --> 00:16:52,960
Matsumoto heads to Kamukura, a ramen place in Shibuya

265
00:16:53,330 --> 00:16:56,060
Where should we wait?

266
00:16:56,800 --> 00:16:58,800
Will they let us in?

267
00:16:58,800 --> 00:17:00,860
If they let us in, we'll be lucky

268
00:17:00,860 --> 00:17:07,400
I think they will, I have a Black Card for Kamukura

269
00:17:09,330 --> 00:17:13,600
There's a lot more shops like that in Osaka

270
00:17:13,930 --> 00:17:18,400
But we would never meet up in Osaka

271
00:17:18,860 --> 00:17:23,100
How would this turn out if we were in Osaka?

272
00:17:20,260 --> 00:17:23,100
If this was in Osaka ... We could do it

273
00:17:23,400 --> 00:17:25,830
It would be impossible in Nagoya

274
00:17:27,430 --> 00:17:33,960
DownTown have no chance of meeting, but the other 3 just might

275
00:17:34,230 --> 00:17:36,700
Wasn't there that one steak place?

276
00:17:37,160 --> 00:17:38,960
Ribera!

277
00:17:37,160 --> 00:17:38,960
Ribera?

278
00:17:38,960 --> 00:17:41,930
They have Pro-wrestler's autographs

279
00:17:39,830 --> 00:17:41,930
Yes yes

280
00:17:42,800 --> 00:17:47,860
Yamasaki might go there, to that Ribera

281
00:17:48,530 --> 00:17:56,560
But I think Yamasaki wouldn't really think about eating meat, he's a herbivore after all

282
00:17:57,400 --> 00:18:03,930
Yamasaki chose a meat specialty restaurant, Jojoen Yugentei

283
00:18:04,430 --> 00:18:08,400
Just in case, he goes inside to check there are autographs on the walls

284
00:18:08,530 --> 00:18:10,530
Hello

285
00:18:11,530 --> 00:18:13,400
But then!

286
00:18:13,400 --> 00:18:18,360
A lot of entertainers come here on their private time,

287
00:18:18,360 --> 00:18:22,860
So this store doesn't really ask for autographs

288
00:18:23,060 --> 00:18:26,100
Ah, you don't ask for autographs?

289
00:18:24,260 --> 00:18:26,100
Yes

290
00:18:26,500 --> 00:18:30,160
We have this here

291
00:18:28,530 --> 00:18:30,160
Ah right, right

292
00:18:30,160 --> 00:18:35,460
I saw this before, and that made me think this place has a lot of autographs

293
00:18:35,460 --> 00:18:40,700
But still look at it please, there are so many autographs on there

294
00:18:41,160 --> 00:18:43,330
Hold on

295
00:18:43,830 --> 00:18:45,460
Hold on!

296
00:18:45,760 --> 00:18:51,260
This is not autograph plaque, but a single Golf Competition's signboard!

297
00:18:52,260 --> 00:18:54,300
Oh crap

298
00:18:55,160 --> 00:18:56,460
Oh no

299
00:18:56,460 --> 00:18:59,860
A place with a lot of autograph plaques!

300
00:19:00,460 --> 00:19:02,330
This is bad

301
00:19:02,330 --> 00:19:06,460
Meanwhile Hamada arrives at the store in Azabujuban

302
00:19:06,700 --> 00:19:09,160
Excuse me

303
00:19:10,360 --> 00:19:12,430
Hello!
Ah, welcome

304
00:19:12,630 --> 00:19:16,130
Manager, is Gagarin's autograph here?

305
00:19:14,830 --> 00:19:16,530
Ah, this one

306
00:19:17,930 --> 00:19:20,230
This... This is...

307
00:19:20,440 --> 00:19:23,360
See! They had it!

308
00:19:23,930 --> 00:19:25,400
Look!

309
00:19:26,200 --> 00:19:32,460
The storeperson researched this, and it might be the autograph of Gagarin's junior

310
00:19:33,260 --> 00:19:35,660
I didn't make a mistake with this place then

311
00:19:36,900 --> 00:19:38,560
That's mine!

312
00:19:42,000 --> 00:19:44,030
Who is this?

313
00:19:45,960 --> 00:19:51,460
I don't remember at all, I can't even tell from the writing

314
00:19:52,160 --> 00:19:56,400
Meanwhile, Matusmoto arrives at Kamukura ramen store in Shinjiku

315
00:19:56,760 --> 00:20:00,430
He claims to be a black card member, and gets in right away

316
00:20:00,560 --> 00:20:05,160
It's time to confirm there are autograph plaques here

317
00:20:06,400 --> 00:20:08,200
But then!

318
00:20:09,460 --> 00:20:13,800
An unexpected surprise! Just what in the diggity doggone goddamned hell just happened?!!?!?!?!?!

319
00:20:15,000 --> 00:20:19,860
Matsumoto is at Kamukura in Shinjiku, looking for autograph plaques,

320
00:20:20,360 --> 00:20:21,500
But then,

321
00:20:21,900 --> 00:20:24,830
We don't have any of the plaques right now actually...

322
00:20:25,300 --> 00:20:28,130
We took them down

323
00:20:28,130 --> 00:20:29,530
We renovated

324
00:20:29,660 --> 00:20:32,060
There were a ton of them in the past right?

325
00:20:32,060 --> 00:20:33,730
Eh? Not anymore?

326
00:20:33,730 --> 00:20:35,760
Yeah, we renovated

327
00:20:35,760 --> 00:20:37,330
When?

328
00:20:37,330 --> 00:20:40,960
We renovated June last year

329
00:20:42,760 --> 00:20:48,800
Indeed, up until last year there was a wall with a ton of plaques,

330
00:20:49,600 --> 00:20:53,900
But not they've renovated, and not one remains

331
00:20:54,100 --> 00:20:58,860
I think I had my autograph up there too, what happened to it?

332
00:20:58,860 --> 00:21:01,860
I think they have it at the headquarters

333
00:21:05,230 --> 00:21:07,930
Time Up here!

334
00:21:08,460 --> 00:21:11,530
The 5 report their locations

335
00:21:14,520 --> 00:21:17,760
We're all alone

336
00:21:15,730 --> 00:21:17,760
Eh? We're all alone again?

337
00:21:18,600 --> 00:21:20,360
Seriously?

338
00:21:20,360 --> 00:21:21,800
Hamada, where are you?

339
00:21:21,800 --> 00:21:24,530
I'm in Azabujuban

340
00:21:24,530 --> 00:21:26,300
A blowfish restaurant, Fugu-take

341
00:21:26,730 --> 00:21:30,030
Oh right! The first floor right?

342
00:21:27,660 --> 00:21:30,030
Ah yeah, Fugu-take

343
00:21:30,160 --> 00:21:32,760
There's no way we would all go there!!

344
00:21:32,760 --> 00:21:37,360
Well, I did sort of give up on that part,

345
00:21:37,360 --> 00:21:38,760
Where are you Endo?

346
00:21:38,960 --> 00:21:40,830
Akasaka Ramen

347
00:21:40,830 --> 00:21:42,030
Akasaka ramen?

348
00:21:42,160 --> 00:21:43,910
Akasaka ramen?

349
00:21:43,910 --> 00:21:48,500
Endo went to Akasaka ramen, where he ate often in his youth

350
00:21:48,500 --> 00:21:53,300
Currently, they have 145 autograph plaques hung up

351
00:21:53,300 --> 00:21:55,800
Also, our autograph is also there

352
00:21:56,100 --> 00:21:57,800
See

353
00:22:00,330 --> 00:22:02,260
That is something to be thankful for

354
00:22:02,430 --> 00:22:04,830
That idea is no good

355
00:22:05,260 --> 00:22:11,300
I'm at that place you associate with celebrities; The Jojoen Yugentei in Nishi-Azabu!

356
00:22:11,460 --> 00:22:14,000
Too much Yugentei!

357
00:22:14,630 --> 00:22:16,730
You went to Yugentei too once

358
00:22:16,730 --> 00:22:19,860
Well yeah, isn't that a good thing?!

359
00:22:19,860 --> 00:22:21,400
Tanaka, where are you?

360
00:22:21,400 --> 00:22:24,960
In Nakame, the Torigoya, the Motsunabe restaurant

361
00:22:24,960 --> 00:22:26,460
That was an option too

362
00:22:26,990 --> 00:22:28,960
How many plaques are there?

363
00:22:29,430 --> 00:22:32,760
They're closed so I can't see inside-

364
00:22:30,930 --> 00:22:32,760
What the hell is that

365
00:22:34,130 --> 00:22:40,360
Based on a memory from over 10 years ago, he decided on the Torigoya in Nakameguro

366
00:22:40,700 --> 00:22:46,300
In fact, they have tons of plaques on their walls

367
00:22:46,700 --> 00:22:50,060
That store is the one I'm most satisfied with out of the other ones

368
00:22:50,060 --> 00:22:52,600
Matsumoto-san, where are you?

369
00:22:52,600 --> 00:22:55,860
If you're from Kansai then you should know!

370
00:22:56,100 --> 00:22:58,530
Ramen Kamukura

371
00:22:58,530 --> 00:23:00,000
Ramen Kamukura?

372
00:23:00,260 --> 00:23:02,000
Shibuya?

373
00:23:02,000 --> 00:23:05,030
They had a 2 story store in Kabukicho,

374
00:23:05,100 --> 00:23:09,900
There were an egregious amount of plaques on the second floor,

375
00:23:10,000 --> 00:23:16,760
And I came here after a long time ... However they've renovated, there's not a single one left

376
00:23:16,930 --> 00:23:18,000
See!

377
00:23:18,330 --> 00:23:20,060
Then that's a bad location to pick

378
00:23:20,060 --> 00:23:22,360
How the hell was I supposed know?!

379
00:23:23,100 --> 00:23:25,400
Are we gonna meet today?

380
00:23:26,230 --> 00:23:29,560
Horrible. This might be our worst one yet!

381
00:23:30,930 --> 00:23:34,660
Next Week - No Smartphone Meetup Finale!

382
00:23:35,200 --> 00:23:38,360
The theme; A large tennis court

383
00:23:38,360 --> 00:23:41,100
There's 6 of them!

384
00:23:41,100 --> 00:23:42,700
6!

385
00:23:42,700 --> 00:23:45,530
Everyone is having so much fun!

386
00:23:46,430 --> 00:23:50,000
Tanaka makes a series of unfathomable choices!

387
00:23:50,430 --> 00:23:51,760
Odaiba, I'm in Odaiba

388
00:23:51,760 --> 00:23:54,800
You don't go Odaiba on NTV!

389
00:23:55,460 --> 00:23:58,830
And more; An encounter with a celebrity!

390
00:23:59,800 --> 00:24:03,560
Will they be able to meet?!

391
00:24:03,790 --> 00:24:12,560
