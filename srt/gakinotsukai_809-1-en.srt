00:00:00,480 --> 00:00:04,380
You know how I am really talented with music?

4
00:00:03,080 --> 00:00:06,920
2 years ago, he made original
songs for the Gaki members

Noda Keiichi

6
00:00:05,580 --> 00:00:08,020
I made you all songs...

7
00:00:06,920 --> 00:00:10,190
to try and live off royalties
for the rest of his life.

8
00:00:08,020 --> 00:00:10,390
Am I actually going to sing?

9
00:00:08,990 --> 00:00:10,390
Yeah.

10
00:00:10,190 --> 00:00:13,490
We were all shocked by his talent.

11
00:00:10,390 --> 00:00:12,060
Why?

12
00:00:13,230 --> 00:00:14,030
To sell...

13
00:00:14,260 --> 00:00:18,000
It explodes in the middle of the town

14

♫ Tokoro made kita mitaida ♫

23
00:00:28,510 --> 00:00:32,680
The theme of this song makes you look so lame...

24
00:00:33,510 --> 00:00:36,420
However, no one from
the music industry called...

25
00:00:36,420 --> 00:00:40,890
So tonight, in order to save
his reputation, Yamasaki will try again.

26
00:00:37,520 --> 00:00:40,890

27

32
00:00:44,060 --> 00:00:46,060
I totally forgot about it.

33
00:00:44,060 --> 00:00:46,060
It's been that long?

34

35
00:00:46,060 --> 00:00:49,590
We've all done the filming

36
00:00:47,690 --> 00:00:49,590
Yes we have.

37
00:00:49,590 --> 00:00:51,600
I am just done...

38
00:00:51,600 --> 00:00:53,600
But seriously,

39
00:00:53,600 --> 00:00:55,430
we've actually done three songs

Right.

44
00:00:57,340 --> 00:00:58,940
A solo for Endo-san.

45
00:00:58,300 --> 00:00:59,670
Yeah.

46
00:00:58,940 --> 00:01:01,310
Then a duet for
Matsumoto-san and Tanaka-san.

47
00:01:01,310 --> 00:01:04,110
Wow awesome, that'll be incredible.

48
00:01:01,310 --> 00:01:04,110

And lastly, all 5 of us,
with Hamada-san being the main lead.

52
00:01:06,780 --> 00:01:08,310
Well, we did it together...

53
00:01:08,210 --> 00:01:15,050
Yamasaki made the song and lyrics

54
00:01:08,310 --> 00:01:11,550
And they're all really good songs this time.

55
00:01:11,550 --> 00:01:13,450
Last time, unfortunately...
none of them became CDs

56
00:01:13,450 --> 00:01:15,050
Last time, unfortunately...
none of them became CDs

57
00:01:15,050 --> 00:01:18,060
You say unfortunately but we had no plans to make it into a CD anyway.

58
00:01:18,060 --> 00:01:21,190
No, but seriously Matsumoto-san,
your song last time...

59
00:01:21,190 --> 00:01:22,990
It seems...

60
00:01:21,190 --> 00:01:22,990

You're going to continue singing!?

67
00:01:28,870 --> 00:01:32,470
There was a bit of a laugh
from the staff so just leave it.

68
00:01:32,470 --> 00:01:36,510
Man, that's lame.

69
00:01:33,140 --> 00:01:36,510

Oh?

73
00:01:44,750 --> 00:01:46,650
First up, Endo.

74
00:01:46,650 --> 00:01:49,750
Endo up first.

75
00:01:46,650 --> 00:01:49,750
It's a solo, right?

76
00:01:47,620 --> 00:01:49,750
Oh this one, I've not

77
00:01:49,750 --> 00:01:53,020
got a clue about it.

78
00:01:50,890 --> 00:01:52,420
Me neither.

79
00:01:52,420 --> 00:01:54,590
This will be the first time we see it.

80
00:01:53,020 --> 00:01:55,430
So I'm looking forward to seeing it.

81
00:01:55,730 --> 00:02:12,510
During Rehearsal

82
00:01:55,860 --> 00:02:00,300
When I think of your song,
my creativity just goes crazy.

83
00:02:00,300 --> 00:02:02,630
Oh, well I'm very thankful to hear that.

84
00:02:01,300 --> 00:02:02,630
Yeah, right?

85
00:02:02,630 --> 00:02:05,340
So, can you listen to this once?

86
00:02:05,340 --> 00:02:07,710
Um... wait, just before that,

87
00:02:07,710 --> 00:02:10,980
last time...

88
00:02:10,980 --> 00:02:12,910
it was death metal right?

89
00:02:11,810 --> 00:02:12,910
Right.

90
00:02:15,310 --> 00:02:17,520
Wow...

91
00:02:17,520 --> 00:02:20,390
This is...

92
00:02:21,820 --> 00:02:23,050
Last time, you were awful.

93
00:02:23,050 --> 00:02:24,990
Last time, you were awful.

94
00:02:24,220 --> 00:02:26,290
Yeah, honestly...

95
00:02:24,990 --> 00:02:27,660
You were like the Endo who I hate the most...

96
00:02:27,660 --> 00:02:29,490
I hate that kind of Endo...

97
00:02:29,490 --> 00:02:31,060
So this time,

98
00:02:31,060 --> 00:02:33,030
it's totally different, seriously.

99
00:02:32,330 --> 00:02:34,130
Really?

100
00:02:33,030 --> 00:02:36,230
I want you to sing this seriously

101
00:02:36,230 --> 00:02:40,140
and to hear your beautiful voice.

102
00:02:38,970 --> 00:02:40,140
Ah, OK.

103
00:02:40,140 --> 00:02:42,410

Like properly...

108
00:02:59,560 --> 00:03:00,760
Yeah.

109
00:03:03,730 --> 00:03:05,230
Huh?

110
00:03:08,100 --> 00:03:15,710
There was a girl who had just split up,
alone at Enoshima, by the sea

it's about summer--

116
00:03:23,850 --> 00:03:25,450
Wait a second...

117
00:03:26,450 --> 00:03:28,220
It's a medley?

118
00:03:27,450 --> 00:03:29,450
Yep.

119
00:03:28,220 --> 00:03:30,820
But I've only just listened to
this song for the first time ever...

120
00:03:30,820 --> 00:03:33,660
and I have to do a medley suddenly?

121
00:03:31,760 --> 00:03:33,660
Yeah, so...

122
00:03:33,660 --> 00:03:35,330
In my head

123
00:03:35,330 --> 00:03:38,230
you've already released loads of hit songs.

124
00:03:38,230 --> 00:03:39,830
Wait a minute...

125
00:03:39,830 --> 00:03:42,230
I don't get the meaning of this.

126
00:03:42,230 --> 00:03:45,540
Seriously, in my head I just
started imagining loads of things

127
00:03:45,540 --> 00:03:47,870
and I got loads of good ideas for songs.

128
00:03:47,870 --> 00:03:51,910
So I got the best part of each song,
so instead of one song

129
00:03:51,910 --> 00:03:54,980
I combined all of them together.

130
00:03:54,980 --> 00:03:58,750
Look at it like this,
I'm betting all this on you

131
00:03:56,180 --> 00:03:58,750

And lastly--

00:06:55,490 --> 00:06:58,230
The very last thing he said...

214
00:06:58,230 --> 00:07:01,630
the, "Once in a lifetime summer,"

215
00:07:01,630 --> 00:07:03,740
that's a bit depressing...

216
00:07:03,740 --> 00:07:06,700
No, not at all, it's to encourage people to

217
00:07:06,700 --> 00:07:09,540
enjoy their summer and Endo
got his message across.

218
00:07:09,540 --> 00:07:12,140
And, as everyone was saying before

219
00:07:12,140 --> 00:07:15,910
I was just suddenly given a medley.

220
00:07:15,910 --> 00:07:18,980
The lyrics are fine, right?
You didn't rip it off from someone, right?

221
00:07:18,980 --> 00:07:20,920
No, of course not.

222
00:07:20,020 --> 00:07:22,750
I'm sure I've listened to something similar.

223
00:07:20,920 --> 00:07:22,750
Yeah, me too.

224
00:07:22,750 --> 00:07:25,260
Well yeah,
you've heard of Enoshima right?

225
00:07:25,260 --> 00:07:29,090
You've heard of the place
Enoshima, that's all.

226
00:07:29,090 --> 00:07:30,600
Really?

227
00:07:29,090 --> 00:07:30,600
That's what you're confusing...

228
00:07:30,600 --> 00:07:33,330
Even the way he sang...

229
00:07:33,330 --> 00:07:34,730
Um--

230
00:07:33,330 --> 00:07:38,340
Half way through, it became
a bit like Sen Masao...

231
00:07:38,340 --> 00:07:42,510
Right, shall we go to the next one?
Tanaka and Matsumoto's duet.

232

We did...

233
00:07:44,080 --> 00:07:47,110
This is something
you wouldn't normally see too.

234
00:07:47,110 --> 00:07:49,750
That's true.

235
00:07:47,780 --> 00:07:49,750
Yeah.

236
00:07:50,050 --> 00:07:52,120
This is really pop-like.

238
00:07:51,820 --> 00:07:54,220

239
00:07:52,120 --> 00:07:55,550
It's really pop, watch, from here...

240
00:07:52,350 --> 00:07:54,220
This is pop?

241
00:07:55,550 --> 00:07:58,360
The prelude is really long.

242
00:07:58,360 --> 00:08:01,890
So as a present,
I'm allowing you to do what you want.

243
00:08:01,890 --> 00:08:04,330
I don't want a present like that...

is meant to be sung by someone in their teens.

272

I guess you're right.

285
00:09:15,470 --> 00:09:17,770

Holy shit...

382
00:11:53,460 --> 00:11:56,460
This is so lame.

383
00:11:53,460 --> 00:11:56,460
This really is.

384
00:11:56,460 --> 00:11:58,900
Incredible!

385
00:11:57,600 --> 00:11:58,900
Sure is.

386
00:11:58,900 --> 00:12:00,430
You moved a lot...

387
00:12:00,430 --> 00:12:02,970
Actually, we did it 3 times because
we screwed up a couple of times...

388
00:12:02,970 --> 00:12:04,200
Ah, I get it.

389
00:12:02,970 --> 00:12:04,200
Right.

390
00:12:04,200 --> 00:12:06,340
My body is so tired...

391
00:12:04,200 --> 00:12:08,510
The prelude was 30 seconds...?

392
00:12:07,340 --> 00:12:09,670
Yes.

393
00:12:08,510 --> 00:12:10,680
And you had to do that dance the whole time?

394
00:12:09,670 --> 00:12:10,680
Right.

395
00:12:10,680 --> 00:12:14,150
I thought whilst doing it,
"Someone has done this kind of dance before."

396
00:12:14,150 --> 00:12:17,080
* Comedian Sakata Toshio (1967 - Present)

397
00:12:14,150 --> 00:12:17,080
Sakata Toshio, right?

398
00:12:17,080 --> 00:12:20,150
No, I don't think so.

399
00:12:20,150 --> 00:12:23,190
It looked similar.

400
00:12:23,190 --> 00:12:25,160
I saw him doing it backstage.

401
00:12:25,160 --> 00:12:28,830
The reason why the song
is written is ridiculous too.

402
00:12:28,830 --> 00:12:30,830
So, if we like have an example...

403
00:12:30,830 --> 00:12:35,030
For example, if we have
Endo and Chiaki, married

404
00:12:35,030 --> 00:12:40,040
and then,
Matsumoto falls in love with Chiaki.

405
00:12:38,800 --> 00:12:41,040
Yeah.

406
00:12:40,040 --> 00:12:44,640
So he falls in love, and this isn't a song
between Endo and Matsumoto as rivals

407
00:12:44,640 --> 00:12:46,640
it's a song about me and Matsumoto-san

408
00:12:46,640 --> 00:12:49,280
where I am supporting him to win...

409
00:12:49,280 --> 00:12:51,520
That's so complicated.

410
00:12:50,180 --> 00:12:55,290
It is complicated, there's 4 people in this story.

411
00:12:51,520 --> 00:12:55,290
What the hell is that...?

412
00:12:55,290 --> 00:12:57,520
And when you include
Sakata Toshio, there's 5 of us.

413
00:12:56,520 --> 00:13:00,360
Yeah, and it becomes complicated.

414
00:12:57,520 --> 00:13:00,360
There's no reason to
include him anyway, but...

415
00:13:00,360 --> 00:13:02,760
"I'm going to score tonight,"
and you reply, "You can do it."

416
00:13:02,760 --> 00:13:05,260
Yeah.

417
00:13:05,260 --> 00:13:08,830
Until our eyes open,
Away and away, More and more.

418
00:13:08,830 --> 00:13:11,670
That's the point.

419
00:13:08,830 --> 00:13:11,670
We tried our best.

420
00:13:11,670 --> 00:13:15,140
And I can't believe that
the producer of that song watches it and

421
00:13:15,140 --> 00:13:17,680
says, "Damn, that's lame."

422
00:13:17,680 --> 00:13:19,480
I can't believe that either.

423
00:13:17,680 --> 00:13:19,480
No...

424
00:13:19,480 --> 00:13:22,950
I couldn't tell when I was watching it live--

425
00:13:21,880 --> 00:13:24,750
I feel so betrayed.

426
00:13:22,950 --> 00:13:24,750
Yeah...

427
00:13:24,750 --> 00:13:29,390
That shouldn't be aired on TV...

428
00:13:29,390 --> 00:13:32,190
I'm really sorry about that.

429
00:13:30,790 --> 00:13:33,660
Yeah...

430
00:13:32,190 --> 00:13:34,830
That was shit!

431
00:13:34,830 --> 00:13:36,830
You're going to admit it?

432
00:13:38,360 --> 00:13:40,670
I mean, that will happen,

433
00:13:40,670 --> 00:13:43,400
but the last one...

434
00:13:41,830 --> 00:13:44,670
This is the one you really like, right?

435
00:13:43,400 --> 00:13:47,310
I do, this song

436
00:13:44,670 --> 00:13:46,740
Yeah, he loves it.

437
00:13:47,310 --> 00:13:49,710
really got good reviews...

438
00:13:49,710 --> 00:13:51,640
From who?

439
00:13:51,640 --> 00:13:53,180
I listen to it in my car,

440
00:13:53,180 --> 00:13:56,680
my daughter remembered
this song and she sings it.

441
00:13:56,680 --> 00:13:59,480
I genuinely cried...

442
00:13:59,480 --> 00:14:01,890
listening to her singing it

443
00:14:01,890 --> 00:14:03,090
Well,

444
00:14:03,090 --> 00:14:06,790
I'm sure your wife was
crying about you crying...

445
00:14:06,790 --> 00:14:09,660
I was really touched.

446
00:14:07,830 --> 00:14:09,660
For a different reason...

447
00:14:09,660 --> 00:14:11,260
The final one

448
00:14:11,260 --> 00:14:13,360
has Hamada in it.

449
00:14:13,360 --> 00:14:15,270
Well, we did it all together

450
00:14:15,270 --> 00:14:17,240
and Yama-chan was part of it too.

451
00:14:17,240 --> 00:14:19,040
I wonder how this one turned out.

452
00:14:19,040 --> 00:14:20,670
Anyway, let's watch it.

453
00:14:20,000 --> 00:14:22,040
OK.

454
00:14:20,670 --> 00:14:22,040
If you would.

455
00:14:22,310 --> 00:14:25,940

No, before that,

458
00:14:28,580 --> 00:14:31,480
it's not even going to be made into a CD.

459
00:14:31,480 --> 00:14:34,220
Wait, does it have to be sold as a CD
for Kouhaku to consider us...?

460
00:14:34,220 --> 00:14:35,890
Well, yeah...

461
00:14:35,890 --> 00:14:37,190
It's about the sales.

462
00:14:37,190 --> 00:14:40,390

463
00:14:40,390 --> 00:14:42,990

becomes a Hamada solo...

00:17:04,270 --> 00:17:06,670

542
00:17:06,670 --> 00:17:10,140
OK then here, if all of us sing

543
00:17:10,140 --> 00:17:12,680
then it should be fine, right?

544
00:17:12,680 --> 00:17:14,850
And then Hamada says
the, "Somehow, always..."

545
00:17:14,850 --> 00:17:19,020
Exactly, let's just sing this altogether.

546
00:17:14,850 --> 00:17:19,020
Then why do we have to do this here?

547
00:17:19,020 --> 00:17:23,390

00:17:32,830 --> 00:17:35,100
Stop complaining!

00:17:33,630 --> 00:17:36,300
No, seriously, it's disgusting.

00:17:36,300 --> 00:17:40,810
Let's just make the "somehow, always"
part just Hamada's thing here...

556
00:17:40,810 --> 00:17:42,340
Oh, from the start?

557
00:17:42,340 --> 00:17:47,380
Then the "Oh stars..." we sing altogether.

558
00:17:47,380 --> 00:17:50,280
Shall we do that?

559
00:17:48,280 --> 00:17:50,280
Well, put bluntly...

565
00:18:01,230 --> 00:18:04,630

567
00:18:06,300 --> 00:18:08,570
I was thinking,
"Damn, he's getting into this."

568
00:18:08,570 --> 00:18:12,670
Damn, I just realised, you guys
must be thinking I'm so up for this...

570
00:18:13,540 --> 00:18:16,840
No, it's just the planning is crap.
