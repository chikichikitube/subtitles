00:00:00,460 --> 00:00:05,020
1st Time on Gaki no Tsukai ya Arrahende

"Anyways, You'd Look Great in this Thing" First Summer Uika Edition!!

3
00:00:14,730 --> 00:00:17,630
What did you guys think about this time?

4
00:00:17,630 --> 00:00:19,800
I can't think of what she'd wear normally

5
00:00:20,130 --> 00:00:21,570
It is pretty tough

6
00:00:21,570 --> 00:00:22,570
Her costume image is pretty strong

7
00:00:22,570 --> 00:00:24,770
Her costume image is pretty strong

8
00:00:24,770 --> 00:00:27,710
This time was the only one that's felt difficult

9
00:00:27,240 --> 00:00:29,310
Only this time?

10
00:00:29,610 --> 00:00:30,340
You guys are just the absolute worst at this

11
00:00:30,340 --> 00:00:32,940
You guys are just the absolute worst at this

12
00:00:31,740 --> 00:00:33,350
Don't include me in this

13
00:00:33,350 --> 00:00:35,710
Ok, just leave him by himself

14
00:00:33,650 --> 00:00:37,020
Tanaka: 11 of the past 13 items were last place

15
00:00:37,020 --> 00:00:39,480
Go to Jinrikisha!!

16
00:00:37,020 --> 00:00:39,480
Production Jinrikisha is a comedian talent agency

17
00:00:39,480 --> 00:00:41,150
You want us to go?

18
00:00:41,150 --> 00:00:44,520
No, no we're part of Yoshimoto

19
00:00:41,150 --> 00:00:44,520
Yoshimoto Creative Agency is the members' agency

20
00:00:44,990 --> 00:00:52,930
A special series on Gaki, where the members buy gifts for guests based on their interests!!

21
00:00:52,930 --> 00:00:54,030
We've not really done too badly

22
00:00:54,030 --> 00:00:55,870
We've not really done too badly

23
00:00:55,870 --> 00:00:56,640
I think you know beforehand who the guest is

24
00:00:56,640 --> 00:00:58,340
I think you know beforehand who the guest is

25
00:00:58,340 --> 00:01:00,210
No way

26
00:01:00,210 --> 00:01:02,310
As if that's true

27
00:01:02,840 --> 00:01:04,010
Hamada gets this tingling feeling before recording

28
00:01:04,010 --> 00:01:06,110
Hamada gets this tingling feeling before recording

29
00:01:06,110 --> 00:01:10,820
He figures out who the guest is

30
00:01:09,010 --> 00:01:10,820
That's not true

31
00:01:11,720 --> 00:01:15,790
Let's all be on an even playing field

32
00:01:15,800 --> 00:01:16,860
Anyway, without further ado

33
00:01:16,860 --> 00:01:19,420
Let's welcome today's guest

34
00:01:25,330 --> 00:01:28,300
Please treat me well

35
00:01:25,430 --> 00:01:29,530
First Summer Uika

36
00:01:30,470 --> 00:01:37,140
The Yankii character from Osaka, all over variety shows, The Naniwa Talking Queen, First Summer Uika

37
00:01:30,470 --> 00:01:37,140
Yankii = Rebellious and wild

38
00:01:37,710 --> 00:01:43,620
The Gaki members will choose a top and an accessory to present to her

39
00:01:43,620 --> 00:01:45,080
Matsumoto-san, what did you think?

40
00:01:45,080 --> 00:01:47,020
Was it difficult?

41
00:01:47,390 --> 00:01:49,150
Hmm, I don't know...

42
00:01:49,150 --> 00:01:53,020
I was thinking of that Yankii style, but surprisingly you dress a bit differently

43
00:01:53,020 --> 00:01:55,930
I think we've seen each other about twice outside of work

44
00:01:55,930 --> 00:01:58,100
Yes, once i think

45
00:01:56,290 --> 00:01:59,130
Ah, so you've seen her in casual clothes

46
00:01:58,100 --> 00:02:00,500
At that time, it was kinda like

47
00:02:00,500 --> 00:02:03,900
Is this always how she dresses casually?

48
00:02:03,900 --> 00:02:06,300
Yama-chan, what do you think?

49
00:02:05,540 --> 00:02:08,440
I was quite confident at the start but

50
00:02:08,440 --> 00:02:09,340
Now that I've seen her in person, I'm even more confident

51
00:02:09,340 --> 00:02:12,010
Now that I've seen her in person, I'm even more confident

52
00:02:10,480 --> 00:02:12,010
Really?

53
00:02:12,010 --> 00:02:14,310
After seeing how she's dressed today?

54
00:02:14,310 --> 00:02:19,050
Not the clothes, but seeing the person herself, has given me confidence

55
00:02:19,050 --> 00:02:19,920
I have no idea what you're talking about

56
00:02:19,920 --> 00:02:21,650
I have no idea what you're talking about

57
00:02:21,650 --> 00:02:22,990
No idea?

58
00:02:22,990 --> 00:02:25,120
Absolutely no idea

59
00:02:26,590 --> 00:02:33,270
Timed, Typeset & Translated by Inepped

60
00:02:35,600 --> 00:02:41,610
Before the show started, the Gaki members went shopping for First Summer Uika

61
00:02:41,710 --> 00:02:47,950
I don't think she wears Osaka style ladies clothes, like dresses

62
00:02:41,770 --> 00:02:47,950
Harajuku

63
00:02:47,950 --> 00:02:50,220
I think she goes for something more rough, American style

64
00:02:50,220 --> 00:02:52,250
I think she goes for something more rough, American style

65
00:02:52,250 --> 00:02:54,590
With a cap or something

66
00:02:54,590 --> 00:02:57,460
There's a bunch of Sukajan

67
00:02:54,590 --> 00:03:12,400
Sukajan = A type of souvenir jacket

68
00:02:57,460 --> 00:03:00,690
Haven't you worn one lately?

69
00:03:00,690 --> 00:03:07,030
Lately it's just like, oh I remember when I wore those

70
00:03:07,030 --> 00:03:09,330
I hate that kinda style

71
00:03:09,330 --> 00:03:12,400
I just can't wear it anymore

72
00:03:16,070 --> 00:03:20,450
How about this?

73
00:03:20,450 --> 00:03:21,780
The off the shoulder kind of look

74
00:03:21,780 --> 00:03:24,680
The off the shoulder kind of look

75
00:03:24,680 --> 00:03:26,320
I dunno

76
00:03:26,320 --> 00:03:28,920
Is it too much

77
00:03:28,920 --> 00:03:32,160
She normally has that Kansai, strong woman image

78
00:03:29,090 --> 00:03:35,430
Daikanyama

79
00:03:32,160 --> 00:03:35,430
I think this time I'll try something a little different

80
00:03:38,530 --> 00:03:40,770
That's cute

81
00:03:41,400 --> 00:03:43,900
This looks good but...

82
00:03:44,200 --> 00:03:45,970
I know we're shopping for the show but

83
00:03:45,970 --> 00:03:48,640
Maybe I should buy this for my daughter

84
00:03:50,280 --> 00:03:55,050
I think that Uika-chan is quite fashionable

85
00:03:50,410 --> 00:03:55,050
Kagurazaka

86
00:03:55,050 --> 00:03:57,880
I think she likes flashy and bright colours

87
00:03:57,880 --> 00:03:59,420
I think she likes flashy and bright colours

88
00:03:59,420 --> 00:04:02,750
I think she likes flashy and bright colours

89
00:04:03,050 --> 00:04:05,620
This is cute

90
00:04:06,890 --> 00:04:08,830
Last time with Riki Choshu, both of your items were bottom

91
00:04:08,830 --> 00:04:11,300
Last time with Riki Choshu, both of your items were bottom

92
00:04:11,300 --> 00:04:15,870
That was a misjudgment on my part
I feel truly bad about that

93
00:04:15,870 --> 00:04:20,740
There's so much stuff which would suit First Summer Uika-chan

94
00:04:16,030 --> 00:04:20,740
Ikebukuro

95
00:04:20,740 --> 00:04:26,510
This is cute! These pumpkin shorts, this is so First Summer Uika

96
00:04:26,510 --> 00:04:29,880
This would definitely suit her

97
00:04:29,880 --> 00:04:31,780
She'd be so happy wearing this

98
00:04:31,780 --> 00:04:34,790
This would suit her perfectly!!

99
00:04:34,790 --> 00:04:35,950
No way

100
00:04:35,950 --> 00:04:36,720
I'm super confident with this

101
00:04:36,720 --> 00:04:38,660
I'm super confident with this

102
00:04:38,660 --> 00:04:40,760
This is so cute!

103
00:04:40,760 --> 00:04:41,990
I wish my daughter liked stuff like this

104
00:04:41,990 --> 00:04:44,160
I wish my daughter liked stuff like this

105
00:04:51,940 --> 00:04:54,770
This is super cute

106
00:04:54,770 --> 00:04:58,180
I'm a 53 year old man though

107
00:04:58,180 --> 00:05:03,150
Finding an accessory is gonna be difficult

108
00:04:58,340 --> 00:05:03,150
Shibuya

109
00:05:03,150 --> 00:05:05,880
This wouldn't work, right?

110
00:05:06,220 --> 00:05:08,220
Nah

111
00:05:09,490 --> 00:05:12,020
This is pretty good

112
00:05:12,020 --> 00:05:13,690
What's written on it?

113
00:05:13,690 --> 00:05:14,790
With the sparkles and glitter, I can't tell at all

114
00:05:14,790 --> 00:05:15,330
With the sparkles and glitter, I can't tell at all

115
00:05:15,330 --> 00:05:18,530
With the sparkles and glitter, I can't tell at all

116
00:05:21,930 --> 00:05:23,400
Its a bow and a tie and a tail?

117
00:05:23,400 --> 00:05:25,770
Its a bow and a tie and a tail?

118
00:05:25,770 --> 00:05:27,340
Its a bow and a tie and a tail?

119
00:05:26,140 --> 00:05:29,110
It's an elephant

120
00:05:26,140 --> 00:05:29,110
Shop Manager

121
00:05:29,110 --> 00:05:31,740
You can press the button on here and

122
00:05:34,850 --> 00:05:37,420
It sounds like a pig

123
00:05:34,850 --> 00:05:37,420
Shop Manager

124
00:05:37,520 --> 00:05:39,620
Its pretty good

125
00:05:39,620 --> 00:05:42,450
It's 1,000 Yen (approx. £6/$7)

126
00:05:39,620 --> 00:05:42,450
Shop Manager

127
00:05:44,960 --> 00:05:53,370
The best items will be taken home by First Summer Uika. The worst will have to pay

128
00:05:53,370 --> 00:05:55,770
We really have to pay out of pocket

129
00:05:53,770 --> 00:05:55,770
We have to pay out of pocket

130
00:05:55,770 --> 00:05:56,100
How much have I had to pay already?

131
00:05:56,100 --> 00:05:58,070
How much have I had to pay already?

132
00:06:00,870 --> 00:06:06,510
Which of their tops will First Summer Uika like.
First up is Matsumoto

133
00:06:06,510 --> 00:06:08,180
Go ahead

134
00:06:06,980 --> 00:06:08,180
To be honest

135
00:06:08,180 --> 00:06:10,420
This time I did the opposite to usual

136
00:06:10,420 --> 00:06:12,050
I didn't worry too much about it

137
00:06:12,250 --> 00:06:13,790
When I spotted this

138
00:06:13,790 --> 00:06:16,050
I thought this was it

139
00:06:16,050 --> 00:06:18,520
So it didn't take long

140
00:06:18,520 --> 00:06:20,160
To pick this out

141
00:06:20,930 --> 00:06:22,160
See

142
00:06:22,960 --> 00:06:24,160
What?

143
00:06:25,260 --> 00:06:26,630
My eyes hurt

144
00:06:27,070 --> 00:06:33,370
16,280 Yen (approx. £100/$115)

145
00:06:27,630 --> 00:06:29,200
My eyes hurt!

146
00:06:29,200 --> 00:06:33,370
It's a long cardigan

147
00:06:33,740 --> 00:06:35,110
This?

148
00:06:33,740 --> 00:06:50,660
Hamada is mimicking Kuidaore Taro, a famous mascot in Osaka who has stripy clothes.
Kuidaore means “to ruin oneself by extravagance in food.”

149
00:06:34,340 --> 00:06:35,110
No!

150
00:06:35,110 --> 00:06:37,510
Who's trying to ruin himself?

151
00:06:38,140 --> 00:06:39,210
It's Kuidaore

152
00:06:39,210 --> 00:06:42,310
How's this Kuidaore, shut up idiot!

153
00:06:43,620 --> 00:06:44,680
You can say

154
00:06:44,680 --> 00:06:45,850
I'm fine being Kuidaore!!

155
00:06:45,850 --> 00:06:47,620
I'm fine being Kuidaore!!

156
00:06:48,920 --> 00:06:50,660
Can we see it on?

157
00:06:51,090 --> 00:06:52,120
Look

158
00:06:52,120 --> 00:06:54,760
It's nice and colourful

159
00:06:54,760 --> 00:06:58,200
It looks super nice!!

160
00:06:59,160 --> 00:07:00,570
What is it made of?

161
00:07:00,570 --> 00:07:03,100
It's like a towel material

162
00:07:04,640 --> 00:07:06,540
You can put this on after a hot bath

163
00:07:06,540 --> 00:07:08,970
You can also wash the dishes with it

164
00:07:09,970 --> 00:07:12,610
Wash it with the dishes

165
00:07:13,140 --> 00:07:15,250
This is bad Matsumoto-san!!

166
00:07:15,250 --> 00:07:17,250
Uika-san please put it over there

167
00:07:17,250 --> 00:07:19,450
She doesn't seem too pleased with that

168
00:07:19,620 --> 00:07:20,890
She's just holding back

169
00:07:20,890 --> 00:07:22,720
She's just holding back

170
00:07:22,720 --> 00:07:24,990
When they open the bag

171
00:07:24,990 --> 00:07:26,190
When a lady opens a bag, you can tell by the look on her face

172
00:07:26,190 --> 00:07:28,790
When a lady opens a bag, you can tell by the look on her face

173
00:07:29,090 --> 00:07:30,600
I don't think that happened

174
00:07:30,600 --> 00:07:31,460
They let out a "wow"

175
00:07:31,460 --> 00:07:34,270
They let out a "wow"

176
00:07:34,270 --> 00:07:36,330
That sounds a little dirty

177
00:07:37,770 --> 00:07:41,840
Next up is Hamada

178
00:07:41,840 --> 00:07:43,880
I pictured her wearing

179
00:07:43,880 --> 00:07:45,910
American style clothes

180
00:07:45,910 --> 00:07:47,580
Maybe a sukajan but a little different than mine

181
00:07:47,580 --> 00:07:49,250
Maybe a sukajan but a little different than mine

182
00:07:49,250 --> 00:07:51,950
That kind of feeling

183
00:07:52,350 --> 00:07:54,650
Was he talking about the sukajan or himself?

184
00:07:54,250 --> 00:07:57,860
I was saying a different sukajan style than mine

185
00:07:58,220 --> 00:08:02,990
Well, it's not that flashy

186
00:07:58,420 --> 00:08:06,360
4,990 Yen (approx. £30/$35)

187
00:08:01,490 --> 00:08:06,100
Do you not think this colour suits her?

188
00:08:08,300 --> 00:08:11,140
A little oversized

189
00:08:09,900 --> 00:08:13,140
Well, it does suit her

190
00:08:12,000 --> 00:08:14,310
Nice and casual

191
00:08:14,310 --> 00:08:17,780
You'd want one of these in the autumn

192
00:08:17,780 --> 00:08:20,040
A more male style jacket

193
00:08:20,040 --> 00:08:22,380
Ah, leave it open

194
00:08:22,380 --> 00:08:24,320
I don't like it that much

195
00:08:24,320 --> 00:08:25,480
It's not about you guys

196
00:08:25,480 --> 00:08:26,180
The Osakan lady yankii's would like this

197
00:08:26,180 --> 00:08:27,950
The Osakan lady yankii's would like this

198
00:08:27,950 --> 00:08:29,120
The Osakan lady yankii's would like this

199
00:08:29,120 --> 00:08:31,590
It looks good like that

200
00:08:31,590 --> 00:08:33,530
What are you on about?

201
00:08:36,690 --> 00:08:41,100
Next to show off his top, Endo

202
00:08:41,100 --> 00:08:44,200
You have that Osaka kind of image

203
00:08:44,200 --> 00:08:46,340
That strong Kansai image

204
00:08:46,340 --> 00:08:48,070
But that's not all you are

205
00:08:48,070 --> 00:08:51,940
I understand that you have a more cute side

206
00:08:51,940 --> 00:08:53,680
As if!!

207
00:08:55,580 --> 00:08:56,510
I expressed that with these clothes

208
00:08:56,510 --> 00:08:59,320
I expressed that with these clothes

209
00:09:01,390 --> 00:09:02,750
There it is

210
00:09:03,620 --> 00:09:08,490
8,910 Yen (approx. £54/$62)

211
00:09:06,660 --> 00:09:08,490
Rather than the style of your image

212
00:09:08,490 --> 00:09:09,730
This shows off a more childish side

213
00:09:09,730 --> 00:09:13,200
This shows off a more childish side

214
00:09:13,200 --> 00:09:14,700
Gap

215
00:09:13,200 --> 00:09:18,640
Gap = Gap Moe is when one does something contradictory to their usual character

216
00:09:14,700 --> 00:09:18,640
Looks like it's time for the Osaka Expo

217
00:09:18,640 --> 00:09:19,540
With a dress

218
00:09:19,540 --> 00:09:22,440
It's easier to see what it's like once it's on

219
00:09:22,770 --> 00:09:25,180
I'll try it on

220
00:09:26,140 --> 00:09:27,510
When presenting clothes

221
00:09:27,510 --> 00:09:28,410
Gap is what I hate the most

222
00:09:28,410 --> 00:09:30,210
Gap is what I hate the most

223
00:09:30,210 --> 00:09:33,450
I get it but this one is ok

224
00:09:34,390 --> 00:09:36,350
Everything ok?

225
00:09:36,350 --> 00:09:38,350
Then please show us

226
00:09:39,020 --> 00:09:40,350
Cute!

227
00:09:43,700 --> 00:09:47,000
That's a stormy face

228
00:09:47,000 --> 00:09:49,370
It looks pretty uncomfortable

229
00:09:49,370 --> 00:09:51,340
I really like it

230
00:09:51,970 --> 00:09:54,040
I think her face betrays it

231
00:09:55,110 --> 00:09:59,540
Next up is the confident Hosei

232
00:09:59,540 --> 00:10:01,550
Uika-chan

233
00:10:01,550 --> 00:10:02,450
Her skin is beautiful

234
00:10:02,450 --> 00:10:05,120
Her skin is beautiful

235
00:10:03,450 --> 00:10:05,120
That makes me happy

236
00:10:05,120 --> 00:10:07,320
She has this doll like image

237
00:10:07,320 --> 00:10:08,990
He's just fishing for points

238
00:10:08,990 --> 00:10:10,020
A doll?

239
00:10:10,020 --> 00:10:14,060
So you're shooting for a doll like image?

240
00:10:14,060 --> 00:10:15,830
Look at the face she's pulling!!

241
00:10:14,190 --> 00:10:15,830
That face!

242
00:10:16,030 --> 00:10:24,800
9,999 Yen (approx. £60/$70)

243
00:10:17,530 --> 00:10:20,530
That's worse than what she's wearing!

244
00:10:21,930 --> 00:10:23,300
Here it is, here it is!

245
00:10:26,300 --> 00:10:27,870
I've already won

246
00:10:27,870 --> 00:10:29,770
It's pretty

247
00:10:28,910 --> 00:10:31,770
Leave it for a doll

248
00:10:30,640 --> 00:10:32,910
You've really done it this time Hosei-san

249
00:10:35,980 --> 00:10:37,950
Let's see it please

250
00:10:44,120 --> 00:10:44,560
Looking good, looking good!!

251
00:10:44,560 --> 00:10:45,660
Looking good, looking good!!

252
00:10:48,460 --> 00:10:52,060
What era do you think we're in?

253
00:10:51,400 --> 00:10:52,760
This isn't about era

254
00:10:52,760 --> 00:10:54,800
You look like @#@#!

255
00:10:57,600 --> 00:11:02,040
Last to present his top is Tanaka

256
00:11:02,040 --> 00:11:03,640
If it's Uika-chan, she will definitely say this:

257
00:11:03,640 --> 00:11:06,240
If it's Uika-chan, she will definitely say this:

258
00:11:06,240 --> 00:11:07,680
"Ah, Tanaka-san, you've opened a new door for me"

259
00:11:07,680 --> 00:11:10,050
"Ah, Tanaka-san, you've opened a new door for me"

260
00:11:10,050 --> 00:11:12,950
Ah, scary, stop saying weird things

261
00:11:14,150 --> 00:11:16,120
It's men's style clothing

262
00:11:17,790 --> 00:11:18,460
What?

263
00:11:18,460 --> 00:11:19,660
Once again

264
00:11:19,660 --> 00:11:19,820
Scary Scary Scary

265
00:11:19,820 --> 00:11:21,230
Scary Scary Scary

266
00:11:21,390 --> 00:11:27,300
6,030 Yen (approx. £36/$42)

267
00:11:23,090 --> 00:11:25,930
This is bad! This is bad! This is bad!

268
00:11:25,260 --> 00:11:27,400
Enough already

269
00:11:27,400 --> 00:11:28,670
Uika-chan

270
00:11:28,670 --> 00:11:30,100
Looks good in men's clothing

271
00:11:30,100 --> 00:11:32,940
A face for the Takarazuka Revue

272
00:11:30,100 --> 00:11:35,770
Takarazuka Revue is a Japanese all-female musical theatre troupe

273
00:11:32,940 --> 00:11:35,770
With this you can attack it head on

274
00:11:40,510 --> 00:11:41,850
See

275
00:11:42,410 --> 00:11:43,580
See

276
00:11:43,580 --> 00:11:44,380
It looks great!

277
00:11:44,380 --> 00:11:48,850
It looks like she's ready for battle!

278
00:11:48,850 --> 00:11:50,290
When's this for?

279
00:11:50,290 --> 00:11:52,120
Halloween

280
00:11:53,790 --> 00:11:55,990
If that's the case, anything would've been ok!!

281
00:11:58,230 --> 00:12:03,900
Among these, which will First Summer Uika choose as her favourite?

282
00:12:03,900 --> 00:12:08,970
Let's start then Uika-san, which of these is your favourite?

283
00:12:08,970 --> 00:12:12,910
Endo

284
00:12:08,970 --> 00:12:12,910
Hamada

285
00:12:08,970 --> 00:12:12,910
Hosei

286
00:12:08,970 --> 00:12:12,910
Matsumoto

287
00:12:08,970 --> 00:12:12,910
Tanaka

288
00:12:12,240 --> 00:12:14,580
It's this one!

289
00:12:12,780 --> 00:12:15,310
And there it is!

290
00:12:14,580 --> 00:12:17,310
Really?!

291
00:12:18,050 --> 00:12:19,680
Of course it is

292
00:12:19,680 --> 00:12:21,020
Can you tell us the reason?

293
00:12:21,020 --> 00:12:22,850
In truth

294
00:12:22,850 --> 00:12:24,220
I'm Hamada, in plain clothes

295
00:12:24,220 --> 00:12:27,190
I'm Hamada, in plain clothes

296
00:12:27,660 --> 00:12:28,630
Hamada isn't even Hamada anymore

297
00:12:28,630 --> 00:12:32,200
Hamada isn't even Hamada anymore

298
00:12:32,200 --> 00:12:35,400
I wear a lot of American style casual clothes

299
00:12:33,900 --> 00:12:35,400
Ah, is that so

300
00:12:34,430 --> 00:12:35,400
Really?

301
00:12:35,400 --> 00:12:37,770
She has surprisingly poor taste

302
00:12:42,140 --> 00:12:46,610
Endo

303
00:12:42,140 --> 00:12:46,610
Hosei

304
00:12:42,140 --> 00:12:46,610
Matsumoto

305
00:12:42,140 --> 00:12:46,610
Tanaka

306
00:12:43,170 --> 00:12:45,980
In 2nd place is?

307
00:12:45,980 --> 00:12:47,280
This one!

308
00:12:53,920 --> 00:12:55,550
I went quite aggressive

309
00:12:55,550 --> 00:12:57,090
and agressive was 2nd place!!

310
00:12:57,090 --> 00:12:58,690
You guys were guessing right?

311
00:12:58,690 --> 00:13:00,830
Downtown were guessing right?

312
00:13:00,020 --> 00:13:00,830
Of course

313
00:13:00,830 --> 00:13:01,860
When I was young, I would always wear something like this

314
00:13:01,860 --> 00:13:03,660
When I was young, I would always wear something like this

315
00:13:03,800 --> 00:13:05,400
I knew it would suit her

316
00:13:05,400 --> 00:13:07,630
I like it so much I will buy it later

317
00:13:08,400 --> 00:13:10,200
I'M SO HAPPY!!

318
00:13:12,500 --> 00:13:15,170
Let's move on to 3rd place

319
00:13:14,410 --> 00:13:15,340
Please

320
00:13:15,340 --> 00:13:18,040
Please!  Please!  Please!

321
00:13:15,340 --> 00:13:19,240
Endo

322
00:13:15,340 --> 00:13:19,240
Hosei

323
00:13:15,340 --> 00:13:19,240
Tanaka

324
00:13:18,680 --> 00:13:20,680
This one!

325
00:13:23,050 --> 00:13:24,350
Really?!

326
00:13:24,350 --> 00:13:25,880
Really?

327
00:13:25,880 --> 00:13:27,550
You gotta be kidding me!!

328
00:13:28,650 --> 00:13:29,550
Well

329
00:13:30,250 --> 00:13:33,190
Out of the three, it's the most usual

330
00:13:33,190 --> 00:13:38,430
I like the form and feel of it

331
00:13:38,430 --> 00:13:41,570
Nobody has suggested anything like it before right?

332
00:13:40,430 --> 00:13:41,570
No not really

333
00:13:43,270 --> 00:13:44,670
See, I've opened a new door

334
00:13:44,670 --> 00:13:46,600
See, I've opened a new door

335
00:13:47,100 --> 00:13:51,580
So, which of these two is the worst!?

336
00:13:51,580 --> 00:13:54,710
The worst is...?

337
00:13:54,710 --> 00:13:56,410
Choose properly

338
00:13:56,410 --> 00:13:58,820
Endo

339
00:13:56,410 --> 00:13:58,820
Hosei

340
00:13:58,150 --> 00:13:59,920
It's this!

341
00:14:01,350 --> 00:14:03,090
I thought so

342
00:14:03,090 --> 00:14:05,090
It's just creepy

343
00:14:05,790 --> 00:14:08,530
This one's impossible

344
00:14:08,530 --> 00:14:11,460
After wearing it yourself?

345
00:14:09,660 --> 00:14:11,460
I'd never want to wear it again

346
00:14:11,460 --> 00:14:13,660
What's the difference between them?

347
00:14:13,660 --> 00:14:15,630
Not that much really

348
00:14:15,630 --> 00:14:17,660
Don't you think that's cute?!

349
00:14:17,660 --> 00:14:19,000
I think I'd rather...

350
00:14:19,000 --> 00:14:22,010
not comment

351
00:14:22,010 --> 00:14:23,610
See it's that bad!!

352
00:14:23,910 --> 00:14:25,610
It's definitely the worst!!

353
00:14:25,840 --> 00:14:28,310
I think this one suits me more

354
00:14:28,310 --> 00:14:30,510
The other doesn't suit you, right?

355
00:14:30,510 --> 00:14:32,180
In this case, the one in last is better

356
00:14:32,180 --> 00:14:34,350
In this case, the one in last is better

357
00:14:34,350 --> 00:14:36,120
It's hard to explain but

358
00:14:36,120 --> 00:14:38,190
This one's not even worth last place

359
00:14:37,860 --> 00:14:40,160
It's so ugly it's sad

360
00:14:40,160 --> 00:14:42,990
That's the worst praise

361
00:14:43,230 --> 00:14:45,160
Are you serious?

362
00:14:44,460 --> 00:14:47,160
Endo's is definitely worse

363
00:14:48,530 --> 00:14:53,940
Regardless of the reason, Hosei has to pay a hefty price

364
00:14:54,770 --> 00:15:02,910
Next, First Summer Uika sees their accessories.
To start is the winner of the tops, Hamada

365
00:15:02,910 --> 00:15:05,750
This is like a mini sukajan

366
00:15:05,750 --> 00:15:09,320
They kind of go together

367
00:15:09,320 --> 00:15:12,320
It was in the same store

368
00:15:12,320 --> 00:15:13,460
Sukajan?

369
00:15:14,060 --> 00:15:17,030
I think this is the perfect accessory, I'm confident in that

370
00:15:17,030 --> 00:15:18,960
It's pretty small

371
00:15:18,960 --> 00:15:20,960
A mask?

372
00:15:19,960 --> 00:15:22,960
Yes, considering the current situation

373
00:15:22,270 --> 00:15:23,670
What's on it?

374
00:15:23,000 --> 00:15:28,310
1,540 Yen (approx. £9/$11)

375
00:15:24,640 --> 00:15:26,500
A dragon

376
00:15:28,310 --> 00:15:31,240
A mask wasn't a bad idea

377
00:15:31,240 --> 00:15:34,080
You look the dangerous type

378
00:15:34,210 --> 00:15:36,980
No she doesn't, it suits her

379
00:15:36,980 --> 00:15:39,380
It's too big

380
00:15:39,380 --> 00:15:41,150
It's hard to breathe in right?

381
00:15:40,280 --> 00:15:41,150
It's hot right?

382
00:15:41,150 --> 00:15:42,450
It's suprisingly not

383
00:15:42,450 --> 00:15:45,190
Rather it's quite nice and warm

384
00:15:45,190 --> 00:15:47,090
It's too big right?

385
00:15:47,460 --> 00:15:52,260
You're fixated on this aren't you

386
00:15:53,330 --> 00:15:57,770
The loser of the first round, Hosei

387
00:15:58,170 --> 00:15:59,370
Excuse me

388
00:15:59,370 --> 00:16:00,340
It's big

389
00:16:00,340 --> 00:16:02,010
It is quite large

390
00:16:02,010 --> 00:16:04,010
It is an accessory, right?

391
00:16:03,810 --> 00:16:07,510
It is, please have a look

392
00:16:13,380 --> 00:16:15,620
Her face kind of clouded over

393
00:16:15,790 --> 00:16:21,690
6,490 Yen (approx. £39/$46)

394
00:16:17,050 --> 00:16:17,990
What's that?

395
00:16:18,190 --> 00:16:19,860
There's some sort of picture on it

396
00:16:19,860 --> 00:16:21,690
Bears?

397
00:16:21,690 --> 00:16:26,200
Is this to go together with the dress?

398
00:16:24,460 --> 00:16:26,200
Is it a matching accessory?

399
00:16:26,200 --> 00:16:29,470
But the dress was last!!

400
00:16:30,100 --> 00:16:32,340
He was confident when he was buying it though

401
00:16:32,340 --> 00:16:33,500
Of course

402
00:16:33,500 --> 00:16:35,170
Were there other patterns?

403
00:16:35,170 --> 00:16:35,840
There were different colours

404
00:16:35,840 --> 00:16:36,970
There were different colours

405
00:16:36,970 --> 00:16:40,310
But they all had bears on them

406
00:16:40,110 --> 00:16:42,450
I think you went to the wrong store

407
00:16:43,910 --> 00:16:48,320
Next up is Matsumoto's accessory

408
00:16:48,320 --> 00:16:50,720
This one was more of a challenge than the top

409
00:16:50,720 --> 00:16:53,060
This one was more of a challenge than the top

410
00:16:53,660 --> 00:16:55,530
The top was definitely a enough big challenge

411
00:16:55,530 --> 00:16:57,600
You'll definitely like this

412
00:16:59,260 --> 00:17:01,030
That looks bad

413
00:17:01,030 --> 00:17:02,230
What is it?

414
00:17:03,130 --> 00:17:04,230
It's a beetle!

415
00:17:04,770 --> 00:17:10,470
8,580 Yen (approx. £51/$60)

416
00:17:10,470 --> 00:17:13,180
It's not!

417
00:17:13,180 --> 00:17:15,380
DJ Koo or Koo Jun-yup is a South Korean DJ

418
00:17:13,180 --> 00:17:15,380
Even DJ Koo wouldn't wear that

419
00:17:16,180 --> 00:17:17,280
This is more...

420
00:17:17,280 --> 00:17:18,920
Furuta Arata

421
00:17:17,280 --> 00:17:18,920
Furuta Aruta is a Japanese actor

422
00:17:19,750 --> 00:17:22,690
The glitter and sparkles suit Uika

423
00:17:23,690 --> 00:17:25,920
It'll make her shine

424
00:17:25,920 --> 00:17:27,020
Looks good

425
00:17:27,020 --> 00:17:29,920
LAME!!

426
00:17:27,160 --> 00:17:29,930
It looks great!

427
00:17:30,390 --> 00:17:32,200
Stop pulling that face!!

428
00:17:32,430 --> 00:17:34,230
How about wearing it slightly tilted?

429
00:17:34,630 --> 00:17:37,770
That's it, cute cute cute!

430
00:17:38,270 --> 00:17:39,770
It looks great!

431
00:17:40,340 --> 00:17:43,310
It's Yattāman

432
00:17:40,340 --> 00:17:43,310
Yattāman is an anime from the 70s

433
00:17:46,040 --> 00:17:50,480
Next up, the in form Tanaka

434
00:17:50,480 --> 00:17:53,550
I'm really confident in this accessory

435
00:17:52,420 --> 00:17:53,550
Really?

436
00:17:53,550 --> 00:17:56,850
I'm grateful you liked the earlier item, I think this will work alongside it

437
00:17:57,190 --> 00:17:58,020
Really?

438
00:17:59,820 --> 00:18:00,690
What is it?

439
00:18:05,130 --> 00:18:06,630
It's a frontal covering

440
00:18:07,300 --> 00:18:08,630
Take this seriously

441
00:18:08,930 --> 00:18:14,540
3,632 Yen (approx. £22/$25)

442
00:18:09,070 --> 00:18:13,000
Wait, wait, it's not like that!

443
00:18:13,000 --> 00:18:14,710
You wear it over a skirt as an accessory

444
00:18:14,710 --> 00:18:16,710
You wear it over a skirt as an accessory

445
00:18:17,110 --> 00:18:18,480
Move it to the side

446
00:18:18,480 --> 00:18:20,580
It looks like the same pattern as my hat

447
00:18:20,810 --> 00:18:22,580
See!

448
00:18:22,080 --> 00:18:24,580
I can see it now

449
00:18:23,110 --> 00:18:27,380
You can wear it with a flashy skirt

450
00:18:27,920 --> 00:18:29,490
and it gives a contrast in colours

451
00:18:29,490 --> 00:18:32,260
You can also wear it up here

452
00:18:32,260 --> 00:18:32,720
Here

453
00:18:32,720 --> 00:18:34,130
On the front?

454
00:18:34,130 --> 00:18:36,160
That looks really weird

455
00:18:36,430 --> 00:18:38,030
That looks really weird

456
00:18:38,030 --> 00:18:39,800
When are you gonna wear this?

457
00:18:39,800 --> 00:18:42,670
Bikkuri Donkey is a Japanese steak house

458
00:18:39,800 --> 00:18:42,670
It looks like a bib from Bikkuri Donkey

459
00:18:46,670 --> 00:18:51,080
Last up is Endo

460
00:18:51,080 --> 00:18:53,140
I also thought

461
00:18:53,140 --> 00:18:54,910
a mask was perfect

462
00:18:54,910 --> 00:18:59,880
But a normal mask with a dragon on doesn't have much impact

463
00:18:59,950 --> 00:19:01,420
I thought

464
00:19:01,850 --> 00:19:07,890
With this mask you can really make an impact

465
00:19:06,720 --> 00:19:09,090
Look at her face, it's clouding over

466
00:19:16,270 --> 00:19:20,840
3,632 Yen (approx. £22/$26)

467
00:19:17,030 --> 00:19:20,840
I think this really has a great impact

468
00:19:20,840 --> 00:19:23,410
This is just... no

469
00:19:24,110 --> 00:19:26,140
Can you turn this way?

470
00:19:32,450 --> 00:19:36,020
It's not like any other mask

471
00:19:35,450 --> 00:19:38,020
Who would want to wear this?!

472
00:19:38,560 --> 00:19:40,490
It's easy to breathe in right?

473
00:19:40,490 --> 00:19:44,530
It keeps poking me in the eye

474
00:19:44,600 --> 00:19:48,270
I think we should swap out Cocorico next time

475
00:19:48,270 --> 00:19:50,270
They're just messing around

476
00:19:54,070 --> 00:19:59,740
How will First Summer Uika rank these accessories?

477
00:19:59,740 --> 00:20:03,610
Your favourite accessory is...?

478
00:20:04,680 --> 00:20:08,190
Endo

479
00:20:04,680 --> 00:20:08,190
Hamada

480
00:20:04,680 --> 00:20:08,190
Hosei

481
00:20:04,680 --> 00:20:08,190
Matsumoto

482
00:20:04,680 --> 00:20:08,190
Tanaka

483
00:20:08,020 --> 00:20:09,290
This one!

484
00:20:08,620 --> 00:20:10,390
Thank you!

485
00:20:10,390 --> 00:20:12,020
There he goes again!

486
00:20:13,320 --> 00:20:16,530
It's obvious why, mine's normal

487
00:20:16,890 --> 00:20:18,260
C'mon, really?

488
00:20:18,260 --> 00:20:20,230
I think the whole country

489
00:20:20,230 --> 00:20:22,530
will agree that this is the right conclusion this time

490
00:20:22,770 --> 00:20:24,530
What about earlier?

491
00:20:25,070 --> 00:20:28,240
Earlier, the tops were a lot closer

492
00:20:27,540 --> 00:20:30,040
It was closer

493
00:20:28,240 --> 00:20:30,040
Yeah it was a harder decision

494
00:20:30,040 --> 00:20:32,010
Mine's normal, that's why

495
00:20:32,010 --> 00:20:34,910
None of the others are normal

496
00:20:34,910 --> 00:20:36,910
Really? No way!

497
00:20:37,180 --> 00:20:39,350
Regardless, I'm happy to take this home

498
00:20:39,350 --> 00:20:40,380
It's a cute accessory

499
00:20:40,380 --> 00:20:41,950
It's still too big though

500
00:20:42,890 --> 00:20:45,620
I can just tighten it

501
00:20:45,920 --> 00:20:46,390
So, let's move on to 2nd place

502
00:20:46,390 --> 00:20:49,990
So, let's move on to 2nd place

503
00:20:49,990 --> 00:20:51,990
In 2nd is?

504
00:20:51,990 --> 00:20:55,430
This one!

505
00:20:52,530 --> 00:20:54,700
Endo

506
00:20:52,530 --> 00:20:54,700
Hosei

507
00:20:52,530 --> 00:20:54,700
Matsumoto

508
00:20:52,530 --> 00:20:54,700
Tanaka

509
00:21:00,100 --> 00:21:02,940
Why?!

510
00:21:02,940 --> 00:21:04,170
I told you so

511
00:21:04,580 --> 00:21:06,040
You're really flying high Tanaka-san

512
00:21:06,040 --> 00:21:08,050
You're really flying high Tanaka-san

513
00:21:08,050 --> 00:21:10,380
I didn't expect anything from you at all

514
00:21:10,780 --> 00:21:12,120
Sorry about that

515
00:21:12,120 --> 00:21:12,880
That's ok

516
00:21:12,880 --> 00:21:15,250
Finding an accessory to wear over a skirt

517
00:21:15,250 --> 00:21:17,550
and one that's really cute

518
00:21:17,550 --> 00:21:19,120
and especially good for the summer

519
00:21:19,120 --> 00:21:21,790
It'll be sweaty

520
00:21:20,120 --> 00:21:21,790
The recipient herself likes it

521
00:21:21,790 --> 00:21:23,860
It'll be super sweaty

522
00:21:24,330 --> 00:21:26,030
The receiver herself likes it

523
00:21:26,030 --> 00:21:28,030
You can just dry it like this

524
00:21:27,260 --> 00:21:28,200
Right?!

525
00:21:28,200 --> 00:21:29,730
The smell of that being half-dried, "wow"

526
00:21:29,730 --> 00:21:31,640
The smell of that being half-dried, "wow"

527
00:21:31,640 --> 00:21:32,940
It'll be fine

528
00:21:32,940 --> 00:21:37,810
Endo

529
00:21:32,940 --> 00:21:37,810
Hosei

530
00:21:32,940 --> 00:21:37,810
Matsumoto

531
00:21:34,510 --> 00:21:37,170
Next, in 3rd place...

532
00:21:37,170 --> 00:21:38,940
This one!

533
00:21:41,650 --> 00:21:43,210
I'm saved!

534
00:21:44,520 --> 00:21:45,210
Bears, really?

535
00:21:45,380 --> 00:21:47,080
You're definitely lying!!

536
00:21:47,080 --> 00:21:51,260
The bears are quite cute

537
00:21:52,190 --> 00:21:54,260
Yama-chan finally

538
00:21:53,590 --> 00:21:54,690
Thank you

539
00:21:54,690 --> 00:21:56,960
I'm in a PANIC!!

540
00:21:57,030 --> 00:21:57,590
PANIC! PANIC!!

541
00:21:57,590 --> 00:21:58,930
PANIC! PANIC!!

542
00:21:58,930 --> 00:22:01,700
I didn't think it'd be this hard

543
00:22:01,700 --> 00:22:02,930
This is bad!

544
00:22:04,640 --> 00:22:07,340
Breathe

545
00:22:05,370 --> 00:22:07,340
I'm panicking too

546
00:22:08,740 --> 00:22:14,280
Which of these will First Summer Uika consider the worst!?

547
00:22:14,280 --> 00:22:16,650
The worst is...?

548
00:22:19,080 --> 00:22:20,980
Please I'm begging you

549
00:22:20,980 --> 00:22:23,590
Imagine putting that on, "Good morning"

550
00:22:23,590 --> 00:22:27,390
Endo

551
00:22:23,590 --> 00:22:27,390
Matsumoto

552
00:22:26,020 --> 00:22:27,390
This one!

553
00:22:30,230 --> 00:22:31,760
You're that happy?

554
00:22:35,200 --> 00:22:36,330
Really?

555
00:22:36,330 --> 00:22:37,840
Of course

556
00:22:37,840 --> 00:22:38,470
Of course

557
00:22:38,470 --> 00:22:40,470
You gotta stop being in the bottom places

558
00:22:40,470 --> 00:22:43,910
Can you imagine showing up somewhere wearing that

559
00:22:43,910 --> 00:22:45,880
Who are you!?

560
00:22:47,410 --> 00:22:50,180
This one was a bit closer to what I'd want

561
00:22:50,180 --> 00:22:53,580
Like an American style hat, but...

562
00:22:53,580 --> 00:22:57,120
The time will come!!

563
00:22:57,120 --> 00:22:58,420
What about the mask?

564
00:22:59,120 --> 00:23:01,890
I don't really get what the thinking is

565
00:23:01,890 --> 00:23:04,190
You think we're living in Mad Max?!

566
00:23:07,830 --> 00:23:12,300
With that said, Endo has to pay out

567
00:23:12,300 --> 00:23:13,600
So, how was today?

568
00:23:13,600 --> 00:23:18,280
I'm really touched with how you were thinking of me

569
00:23:17,110 --> 00:23:20,840
Everyone thought quite hard

570
00:23:21,310 --> 00:23:25,120
I now think a bit better of Tanaka-san

571
00:23:25,820 --> 00:23:29,290
This time you were pretty close

572
00:23:28,890 --> 00:23:30,320
We were all suprised

573
00:23:29,820 --> 00:23:33,120
On the other hand I'm quite worried about you Endo-san

574
00:23:34,490 --> 00:23:36,560
You didn't want it personally

575
00:23:36,560 --> 00:23:38,930
I don't think anyone would ever want it

576
00:23:39,930 --> 00:23:41,170
Really?

577
00:23:42,370 --> 00:23:43,830
I thought it was cool
