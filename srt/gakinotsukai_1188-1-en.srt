1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,000
Gaki no tsukai presents...

2
00:00:03,000 --> 00:00:10,040
I am the one who understands everyone the best!
At any rate, you like this item, right?! Championship'

3
00:00:11,840 --> 00:00:12,700
Wonder what it is exactly?

4
00:00:12,700 --> 00:00:15,800
How long have we known each other?

5
00:00:15,800 --> 00:00:17,650
10 years can't do it

6
00:00:17,650 --> 00:00:18,300
20 years?

7
00:00:18,340 --> 00:00:19,940
24 years already!

8
00:00:19,940 --> 00:00:21,940
Oh 24 years since Gaki aired for the first time.

9
00:00:21,940 --> 00:00:27,420
Yes and some of us even knew each other before that. By now we should know what each other likes and dislikes.

10
00:00:27,420 --> 00:00:31,900
Also hobbies and things we carry and so on.

11
00:00:31,900 --> 00:00:36,280
At any rate, you like this item?! Is what we are going to shop for.

12
00:00:36,280 --> 00:00:39,300
"Wow you know him well" is the reaction we want.

13
00:00:39,300 --> 00:00:42,200
Here are the things we are going to find.

14
00:00:42,200 --> 00:00:46,560
A jacket that Matsumoto will like

15
00:00:46,560 --> 00:00:50,900
I wear a jacket every day, so you must know.

16
00:00:50,900 --> 00:00:53,100
Like, you must have seen it!

17
00:00:53,100 --> 00:00:55,060
A cardigan that Tanaka likes.

18
00:00:55,060 --> 00:00:56,280
That the easiest one!

19
00:00:56,280 --> 00:00:58,880
The easiest? Really?

20
00:00:58,900 --> 00:01:02,660
If I have time i will knit it for him

21
00:01:03,560 --> 00:01:13,120
They each head out to find goods that the other members will like, but will they succeed?

22
00:01:13,740 --> 00:01:16,600
Wow, this place...

23
00:01:16,880 --> 00:01:21,440
So amazing, totally Endo.

24
00:01:21,980 --> 00:01:24,720
This would look good on Tanaka.

25
00:01:25,340 --> 00:01:28,580
The others are good too though.

26
00:01:30,060 --> 00:01:33,420
Endo could wear this..

27
00:01:33,880 --> 00:01:38,580
So much something he'd wear

28
00:01:39,240 --> 00:01:41,680
isn't this fine?

29
00:01:42,500 --> 00:01:44,660
So fast!! (at deciding)

30
00:01:45,260 --> 00:01:47,520
This will do, right?

31
00:01:47,520 --> 00:01:51,280
So many t-shirts I think Hamada would like.

32
00:01:51,360 --> 00:01:57,280
Hamada... which do you think he'll like?

33
00:01:57,380 --> 00:02:00,300
I wonder what he likes..

34
00:02:00,460 --> 00:02:05,480
Yamazaki's interests are totally opposite of mine

35
00:02:05,480 --> 00:02:08,940
But I like people that are completely opposite of me.

36
00:02:13,460 --> 00:02:16,880
Now this is a good one

37
00:02:16,880 --> 00:02:19,520
Because he is this weird guy

38
00:02:19,540 --> 00:02:24,620
I'm not joking I really think he'll like this one.

39
00:02:24,620 --> 00:02:26,560
That went fast

40
00:02:26,560 --> 00:02:30,580
The one I'm most unsure about is Hamada's T-shirt

41
00:02:30,920 --> 00:02:42,870
Translation by Outlaws
Timing by yamasakigifs.tumblr.com

42
00:02:43,360 --> 00:02:46,740
At any rate, you like this item, right?! Championship'

43
00:02:46,740 --> 00:02:52,660
They each pick items the other members will like, who knows their fellow members the best?

44
00:02:52,660 --> 00:02:56,440
The person receiving the items will rank them according to their taste

45
00:02:56,440 --> 00:03:03,580
whoever takes 1st place won't have to pay anything. The person on last place will pay for the cloth that they found.

46
00:03:03,580 --> 00:03:06,160
I ain't going to lose

47
00:03:06,360 --> 00:03:11,080
First up is the always cap wearing Endo

48
00:03:11,080 --> 00:03:13,960
Starting is his partner Tanaka

49
00:03:13,960 --> 00:03:17,840
I'm the one spending most time with him..

50
00:03:18,620 --> 00:03:20,380
So confident!

51
00:03:20,400 --> 00:03:22,420
Go ahead

52
00:03:28,580 --> 00:03:31,180
Look!

53
00:03:32,200 --> 00:03:33,450
Right?!

54
00:03:33,450 --> 00:03:34,700
You surely like that.

55
00:03:34,700 --> 00:03:35,920
So much you.

56
00:03:35,920 --> 00:03:37,920
fits with your hobbies.

57
00:03:37,920 --> 00:03:39,120
I'll try it on.

58
00:03:39,120 --> 00:03:40,580
Yes! try it.

59
00:03:40,780 --> 00:03:43,380
Good feeling around that one

60
00:03:46,520 --> 00:03:52,400
The thing is, the front doesn't matter
that much, but the side..

61
00:03:53,380 --> 00:03:56,160
If side isn't good..
looking at it now...

62
00:03:56,160 --> 00:03:58,480
Oh yeah, i see.

63
00:04:00,860 --> 00:04:05,480
Next up is the cap that Hamada chose for Endo

64
00:04:07,650 --> 00:04:08,480
What?

65
00:04:07,980 --> 00:04:09,660
Is it good?

66
00:04:09,960 --> 00:04:11,660
Looks good

67
00:04:12,600 --> 00:04:16,680
Think he's got it.

68
00:04:19,240 --> 00:04:21,360
Good one!

69
00:04:21,360 --> 00:04:24,600
Hamada.. I feel like I'm gonna cry

70
00:04:24,600 --> 00:04:26,660
Very good one!

71
00:04:26,860 --> 00:04:29,880
Not bad at all

72
00:04:29,880 --> 00:04:34,760
3rd is Yamazaki with his choice of cap for Endo

73
00:04:34,760 --> 00:04:37,520
Here's the one I chose for you

74
00:04:38,020 --> 00:04:42,660
Oh, but why this camouflage-pattern on it?

75
00:04:42,680 --> 00:04:46,100
I don't feel a hat that big is for Endo

76
00:04:46,100 --> 00:04:50,240
I might like this cap when playing golf

77
00:04:50,380 --> 00:04:51,500
Yes exactly

78
00:04:51,500 --> 00:04:52,920
thank you

79
00:04:52,880 --> 00:04:54,080
Endo..

80
00:04:54,080 --> 00:04:55,780
You made a good comment..

81
00:04:55,780 --> 00:05:02,540
"When playing golf" That's the thought i had in mind. Yours are a little off

82
00:05:02,540 --> 00:05:10,880
He may like yours, but he'll love mine.

83
00:05:11,160 --> 00:05:13,080
Take a look!

84
00:05:13,320 --> 00:05:14,760
You serious?

85
00:05:14,480 --> 00:05:16,380
no no no..

86
00:05:18,120 --> 00:05:22,180
No really, so much him. look!

87
00:05:25,800 --> 00:05:27,200
Endo, tell them

88
00:05:26,680 --> 00:05:29,840
Totally honest, it's pretty good

89
00:05:29,640 --> 00:05:31,960
You see? I knew it!

90
00:05:32,200 --> 00:05:35,420
I see right through him.

91
00:05:35,700 --> 00:05:41,060
You might think it's a joke or that I'm just being positiv because he's my sempai

92
00:05:41,060 --> 00:05:43,060
But i'm honest about it

93
00:05:43,060 --> 00:05:49,560
i tend to go to the extremes
when playing golf, so I like this cap

94
00:05:49,560 --> 00:05:51,980
I like it!

95
00:05:52,820 --> 00:05:56,850
It's getting close to Endo. It has a secret intention.

96
00:05:56,850 --> 00:06:01,500
Like it says "Endo, reach out your hand and pick me!".

97
00:06:02,940 --> 00:06:08,000
But to be honest, i wouldn't wear any of them

98
00:06:06,960 --> 00:06:08,640
Really?

99
00:06:08,640 --> 00:06:11,560
Don't want any of them.
Would throw them away instantly

100
00:06:11,100 --> 00:06:12,780
What about the golf cap?

101
00:06:12,780 --> 00:06:14,580
That's the worst one!

102
00:06:14,580 --> 00:06:15,360
Really?

103
00:06:15,120 --> 00:06:19,920
But that doesn't matter, I only though about Endo

104
00:06:18,900 --> 00:06:20,420
Yes, it's about me now

105
00:06:21,340 --> 00:06:26,280
But which cap does Endo like the best?!

106
00:06:27,420 --> 00:06:28,000
This one

107
00:06:27,820 --> 00:06:30,000
Yes!

108
00:06:31,460 --> 00:06:33,940
You must be kidding..

109
00:06:33,940 --> 00:06:39,900
I probably wouldn't wear it
most public places

110
00:06:39,900 --> 00:06:45,100
But at the golf course,
I think I'll wear this a lot

111
00:06:45,100 --> 00:06:49,620
I can't wait meeting people with "golf" written on my cap

112
00:06:49,620 --> 00:06:51,360
Would be a good loser.

113
00:06:51,360 --> 00:06:56,020
Now it's time to find out who's going to pay for the cap. The worst cap is...

114
00:06:56,140 --> 00:06:57,620
Sorry Hôsei

115
00:06:57,620 --> 00:06:59,940
To be honest

116
00:07:00,200 --> 00:07:02,100
I wouldn't buy this.

117
00:07:02,100 --> 00:07:03,920
Liar!!

118
00:07:02,370 --> 00:07:10,350
Hôsei has to pay 3,675 yen

119
00:07:06,920 --> 00:07:10,120
Why wouldn't you buy it?!

120
00:07:10,260 --> 00:07:12,340
Did i lose to the golf cap?

121
00:07:12,340 --> 00:07:15,060
You're serious, right Endo?

122
00:07:15,060 --> 00:07:18,180
I would never wear this.

123
00:07:18,180 --> 00:07:19,600
true story

124
00:07:18,820 --> 00:07:20,720
How many point would you give Yamasaki's?

125
00:07:20,260 --> 00:07:22,320
Out of 100?

126
00:07:22,320 --> 00:07:23,960
Around 15.

127
00:07:23,980 --> 00:07:24,940
so low.

128
00:07:25,400 --> 00:07:27,040
it must be a joke

129
00:07:27,040 --> 00:07:28,460
It's no joke

130
00:07:27,760 --> 00:07:30,680
All your bad points are showing today!

131
00:07:31,340 --> 00:07:34,560
Next up is the search for Hamada's favorite t-shirt

132
00:07:34,560 --> 00:07:38,880
1st is the loser from last round Hôsei

133
00:07:38,880 --> 00:07:41,680
High quality right here

134
00:07:41,680 --> 00:07:44,380
Touching it and you just know it's for Hamada

135
00:07:44,380 --> 00:07:46,580
Right, here it is.

136
00:07:45,420 --> 00:07:48,220
You know nothing about Hamada

137
00:07:49,140 --> 00:07:50,920
No way

138
00:07:50,920 --> 00:07:53,230
No way he likes the "Hawaii" written there

139
00:07:53,230 --> 00:07:56,800
The color is no good too. This is surely going to be the worst one.

140
00:07:56,880 --> 00:07:58,780
You are making fun of Hamada

141
00:07:59,920 --> 00:08:02,120
The color is no good

142
00:08:02,160 --> 00:08:06,460
2nd to show what they've found is Endo

143
00:08:09,180 --> 00:08:13,640
Take a look at the old feel of it. Certain you'll like it.

144
00:08:15,060 --> 00:08:19,540
that's true, think he's found a good one.

145
00:08:20,280 --> 00:08:25,520
Much better than Yamazaki's. Just look how he's laughing.

146
00:08:25,660 --> 00:08:27,440
Pretty good.

147
00:08:27,760 --> 00:08:32,180
And now it's time for Tanaka to present a T-shirt that Hamada will like

148
00:08:32,880 --> 00:08:34,180
This one.

149
00:08:36,020 --> 00:08:37,860
That color, huh?

150
00:08:37,900 --> 00:08:39,660
I see.

151
00:08:39,660 --> 00:08:44,460
I bet you like that color.

152
00:08:44,460 --> 00:08:45,740
I get it.

153
00:08:45,740 --> 00:08:47,400
But the text is not very good

154
00:08:47,400 --> 00:08:50,240
The text is too high up too..

155
00:08:50,080 --> 00:08:51,340
The text?

156
00:08:50,960 --> 00:08:52,700
Should be lower.

157
00:08:52,420 --> 00:08:54,400
What are you talking about?!

158
00:08:54,760 --> 00:08:58,360
That doesn't matter, it's fine.

159
00:08:58,520 --> 00:09:03,380
Last to find a T-shirt for Hamada is his partner Matumoto

160
00:09:03,380 --> 00:09:08,820
I think he'll sleep wearing it tonight

161
00:09:09,650 --> 00:09:11,720
You think he'll like it?

162
00:09:11,720 --> 00:09:16,560
I've known him since kindergarden after all,
so this is what i found...

163
00:09:17,660 --> 00:09:18,540
This is...

164
00:09:18,540 --> 00:09:19,460
Riddell.

165
00:09:19,460 --> 00:09:21,080
Riddell? who..?

166
00:09:21,080 --> 00:09:24,080
Some random guy wrote it.

167
00:09:24,080 --> 00:09:25,880
He just wrote it?

168
00:09:25,880 --> 00:09:28,240
Yeah, I get it.

169
00:09:28,240 --> 00:09:29,280
Right?

170
00:09:29,280 --> 00:09:30,820
I could wear this.

171
00:09:30,820 --> 00:09:33,460
Yes, right? Riddell is written after all.

172
00:09:33,200 --> 00:09:35,020
Riddell doesn't matter!

173
00:09:35,020 --> 00:09:37,640
In fact the T-shirt is reversible

174
00:09:37,640 --> 00:09:40,820
When you wear it you can for example do this

175
00:09:40,820 --> 00:09:43,640
Take a look at that.

176
00:09:43,640 --> 00:09:47,940
On the other side it's white

177
00:09:48,500 --> 00:09:51,060
No sorry, no good.

178
00:09:51,060 --> 00:09:53,360
He will absolutely put the pin-mic there!

179
00:09:53,440 --> 00:09:57,440
But i could wear these, no doubt.

180
00:09:57,880 --> 00:09:59,120
Yes, all of them!

181
00:09:58,620 --> 00:10:01,300
I wear these types a lot, right?

182
00:10:00,160 --> 00:10:01,460
Them all!

183
00:10:01,460 --> 00:10:07,300
But this.. Yama-chan I really have no T-shirt with a place written on it

184
00:10:07,300 --> 00:10:11,960
But it will fit you, I know it will fit you Hamada..

185
00:10:11,960 --> 00:10:15,840
This feels cheaply made too,
I don't like that.

186
00:10:15,840 --> 00:10:17,700
It will fit you Hamada

187
00:10:17,700 --> 00:10:20,600
I'm sorry but this is the worst of them all

188
00:10:20,600 --> 00:10:25,500
Hôsei has to pay 1000 yen

189
00:10:21,600 --> 00:10:23,500
Really?!

190
00:10:23,500 --> 00:10:25,220
What's going on?!

191
00:10:25,220 --> 00:10:27,800
That was an easy one

192
00:10:28,080 --> 00:10:29,920
Not my style

193
00:10:28,900 --> 00:10:31,540
No way at all!

194
00:10:32,080 --> 00:10:33,500
Must be kidding...

195
00:10:33,080 --> 00:10:35,680
So Hamada which do you like the best?

196
00:10:35,680 --> 00:10:36,860
I have made my choice..

197
00:10:36,880 --> 00:10:38,700
Number 1 is...

198
00:10:38,700 --> 00:10:40,680
This one

199
00:10:41,200 --> 00:10:42,480
Yes!

200
00:10:44,620 --> 00:10:46,920
Don't they all look alike?

201
00:10:46,920 --> 00:10:51,480
Well, number 1 and
these two are all very fine.

202
00:10:51,480 --> 00:10:56,300
But no way I'd wear this!

203
00:10:56,770 --> 00:11:02,370
Next up is finding underpants
for the 2 times in a row loser Hôsei

204
00:11:02,370 --> 00:11:04,710
Matsumoto goes first

205
00:11:06,140 --> 00:11:07,450
Right?

206
00:11:07,450 --> 00:11:09,250
Like it, right?

207
00:11:08,550 --> 00:11:10,080
Hold on a moment.

208
00:11:09,250 --> 00:11:11,450
He's smiling..

209
00:11:10,150 --> 00:11:11,850
show them

210
00:11:11,850 --> 00:11:12,680
Look!

211
00:11:12,680 --> 00:11:14,620
Right?

212
00:11:14,620 --> 00:11:16,620
What's funny?

213
00:11:15,420 --> 00:11:18,590
He's all happy now

214
00:11:17,760 --> 00:11:19,560
Seriously...

215
00:11:18,990 --> 00:11:20,190
He totally loves it.

216
00:11:20,190 --> 00:11:21,630
Truly loves it.

217
00:11:21,630 --> 00:11:24,230
Got him with this one

218
00:11:24,560 --> 00:11:27,830
You'd wear a thing like that!?

219
00:11:27,970 --> 00:11:30,740
You'd wear it though
you're 40-something?

220
00:11:30,740 --> 00:11:32,740
I'm 46.

221
00:11:31,440 --> 00:11:33,770
He likes them this cute

222
00:11:34,170 --> 00:11:37,740
Even if I liked the look I could never wear it.

223
00:11:37,740 --> 00:11:38,980
So cute

224
00:11:39,340 --> 00:11:41,710
It looks even better when on a mannequin.

225
00:11:41,710 --> 00:11:46,050
Second to present is Endo

226
00:11:48,790 --> 00:11:51,320
You're kidding me!

227
00:11:48,790 --> 00:11:52,120
You get it, you totally get it!

228
00:11:51,320 --> 00:11:54,590
Stop it already!

229
00:11:54,860 --> 00:11:58,530
But the drawing is on the butt.

230
00:11:55,890 --> 00:11:57,200
On the ass.

231
00:11:57,900 --> 00:11:58,730
Endo,

232
00:11:58,460 --> 00:11:59,030
Yea?

233
00:11:58,730 --> 00:12:00,830
that's a problem...

234
00:12:00,830 --> 00:12:02,600
the front is too plain.

235
00:12:02,600 --> 00:12:04,140
This is the back?

236
00:12:03,500 --> 00:12:04,600
That's right.

237
00:12:04,140 --> 00:12:06,370
Nah, should have been opposite.

238
00:12:06,370 --> 00:12:10,240
Does he really want it to be that cute?

239
00:12:10,240 --> 00:12:12,910
Yamazaki won't like that.

240
00:12:11,510 --> 00:12:13,380
I don't get it...

241
00:12:15,710 --> 00:12:18,450
No way...

242
00:12:18,450 --> 00:12:20,120
See, told you.

243
00:12:20,120 --> 00:12:22,290
Really?

244
00:12:20,120 --> 00:12:23,420
Has to be full frontal cuteness.

245
00:12:22,720 --> 00:12:25,660
Eh, this isn't the front??

246
00:12:24,690 --> 00:12:25,660
No, no it isn't.

247
00:12:25,660 --> 00:12:30,660
What underpants have Tanaka found for Yamazaki?

248
00:12:30,660 --> 00:12:33,060
I searched a lot for this one

249
00:12:32,100 --> 00:12:36,400
I don't doubt you.

250
00:12:33,060 --> 00:12:37,440
You'll like it, I'm sure-

251
00:12:39,070 --> 00:12:40,370
Even yours?

252
00:12:40,370 --> 00:12:42,410
Even you Tanaka?

253
00:12:42,410 --> 00:12:44,310
You got it.

254
00:12:42,410 --> 00:12:46,510
well of course, I've know him for so many years.

255
00:12:45,910 --> 00:12:47,710
You're not far off..

256
00:12:48,380 --> 00:12:49,950
Unbelievable!!

257
00:12:49,950 --> 00:12:51,550
Cute!!

258
00:12:50,680 --> 00:12:52,720
You nailed it, Tanaka!

259
00:12:52,720 --> 00:12:54,890
Known him for so many years.

260
00:12:53,620 --> 00:12:55,350
You understand!

261
00:12:54,890 --> 00:12:57,990
A cute Mr. bear with pancakes.

262
00:12:56,590 --> 00:12:59,060
I can't believe it!

263
00:12:58,360 --> 00:13:00,220
You totally get him, Tanaka.

264
00:13:00,220 --> 00:13:04,960
Hamada-san... give Hōsei
the pants he'll like.

265
00:13:03,030 --> 00:13:06,160
I looked at it differently

266
00:13:06,160 --> 00:13:08,160
When searching for the underpants

267
00:13:08,160 --> 00:13:09,970
I thought of a more adult Yamazaki

268
00:13:09,970 --> 00:13:11,970
The adult Yamazaki..

269
00:13:11,970 --> 00:13:14,240
You don't know Yamazaki at all.

270
00:13:14,240 --> 00:13:17,310
but it's been many years now

271
00:13:17,310 --> 00:13:19,840
All the time, frankly,

272
00:13:19,840 --> 00:13:23,410
you can't  stay in the world of cartoons.

273
00:13:21,950 --> 00:13:23,410
What's this world of cartoons?

274
00:13:23,410 --> 00:13:25,410
Eh... cartoon world?

275
00:13:24,350 --> 00:13:26,180
Didn't know such thing existed

276
00:13:29,990 --> 00:13:30,860
Ahh...

277
00:13:30,860 --> 00:13:33,520
All yours are so cute

278
00:13:33,520 --> 00:13:34,790
Hamada got it wrong!

279
00:13:34,790 --> 00:13:37,600
Hamada's doesn't fit at all!

280
00:13:34,790 --> 00:13:37,600
What the... huh??

281
00:13:38,130 --> 00:13:39,600
Look at his face!

282
00:13:38,130 --> 00:13:40,260
It.. it's giraffe...

283
00:13:40,900 --> 00:13:43,030
no, no, no...

284
00:13:43,030 --> 00:13:45,900
You absolutely don't know him.

285
00:13:43,530 --> 00:13:45,570
G-giraffe...

286
00:13:45,900 --> 00:13:47,370
I'll pick the loser now.

287
00:13:47,370 --> 00:13:49,340
Sorry but the loser is...

288
00:13:49,340 --> 00:13:51,340
this one!

289
00:13:51,340 --> 00:13:53,080
It was obvious.

290
00:13:51,340 --> 00:13:53,080
Yep!

291
00:13:51,340 --> 00:13:54,410
Hamada has to pay 3,360 yen

292
00:13:53,080 --> 00:13:55,610
This thing is frightening!

293
00:13:54,780 --> 00:13:57,080
No doubt!

294
00:13:55,610 --> 00:13:58,180
A thing like this...

295
00:13:57,080 --> 00:13:58,180
Yeah, yeah.

296
00:13:58,180 --> 00:13:58,920
Hold on!

297
00:13:58,920 --> 00:14:01,290
What kind of pants
are you wearing today?

298
00:14:01,720 --> 00:14:02,820
See, like that!

299
00:14:02,350 --> 00:14:03,350
Cute!

300
00:14:02,350 --> 00:14:03,350
Cuute...

301
00:14:04,420 --> 00:14:08,330
This is hopeless...
I give up!

302
00:14:08,330 --> 00:14:10,560
But they're like that see.

303
00:14:09,230 --> 00:14:10,560
I see.

304
00:14:10,600 --> 00:14:12,200
What do I do??

305
00:14:12,200 --> 00:14:14,200
Huh?

306
00:14:14,200 --> 00:14:15,230
With Endo's,

307
00:14:15,130 --> 00:14:16,270
Yes?

308
00:14:15,230 --> 00:14:18,370
it'd be perfect if that was the front.

309
00:14:17,470 --> 00:14:18,570
Ah, that so?

310
00:14:18,840 --> 00:14:20,610
It had to be the front.

311
00:14:20,610 --> 00:14:25,310
Choice between cakes
and a bear-like thing..

312
00:14:25,640 --> 00:14:29,150
This is agony!!

313
00:14:26,940 --> 00:14:29,150
What the heck?!

314
00:14:29,150 --> 00:14:30,650
What?!

315
00:14:32,320 --> 00:14:33,750
I've made my choice

316
00:14:36,990 --> 00:14:38,920
This!

317
00:14:37,420 --> 00:14:38,920
Alright!!

318
00:14:38,920 --> 00:14:41,190
Ah, really...

319
00:14:42,060 --> 00:14:45,230
Well, he likes the cute stuff

320
00:14:44,420 --> 00:14:45,360
That's right!

321
00:14:45,360 --> 00:14:46,830
That one's overly cute.

322
00:14:46,830 --> 00:14:47,930
As you'd think.

323
00:14:47,300 --> 00:14:47,930
Indeed.

324
00:14:47,930 --> 00:14:49,470
Too cute?

325
00:14:49,470 --> 00:14:50,200
Yep.

326
00:14:50,200 --> 00:14:52,040
Just a bit too cute.

327
00:14:51,800 --> 00:14:55,370
As a dad that is no good

328
00:14:52,040 --> 00:14:54,110
What about that?

329
00:14:55,370 --> 00:14:57,610
Wandering around getting ready for a bath

330
00:14:57,610 --> 00:15:02,350
The kids are gonna ask "What the heck is that"?

331
00:14:59,410 --> 00:15:02,350
Same with yours!

332
00:15:02,350 --> 00:15:10,250
Next is Matsumoto who's in good mood after being declared the winner in last round.

333
00:15:10,250 --> 00:15:12,390
Um... Matsumoto,

334
00:15:12,790 --> 00:15:16,390
I've never seen him in anything
other than something like this

335
00:15:15,560 --> 00:15:17,460
Oh you are looking at it the opposit way

336
00:15:16,390 --> 00:15:17,460
Exactly

337
00:15:19,260 --> 00:15:20,670
Totally him

338
00:15:20,670 --> 00:15:22,200
Right?

339
00:15:21,400 --> 00:15:23,730
You have that image of him

340
00:15:23,730 --> 00:15:25,600
I have to be honest

341
00:15:25,600 --> 00:15:28,670
"i'm no fun" is what this says

342
00:15:31,680 --> 00:15:33,110
I think,

343
00:15:31,680 --> 00:15:33,110
No but...

344
00:15:33,110 --> 00:15:36,480
Is this Frankensteins?

345
00:15:36,480 --> 00:15:38,150
I want one..

346
00:15:38,150 --> 00:15:41,320
I want one that is a little more positiv

347
00:15:41,320 --> 00:15:43,720
This is Frankensteins jacket.

348
00:15:43,720 --> 00:15:46,390
It's not his.

349
00:15:46,390 --> 00:15:51,400
What jacket has Endo picked?

350
00:15:51,430 --> 00:15:53,760
He's got his usual jackets

351
00:15:53,760 --> 00:15:58,200
But I don't think any of them are black

352
00:15:57,500 --> 00:15:59,800
When you look more carefully...

353
00:15:58,740 --> 00:16:01,540
That's right

354
00:15:59,100 --> 00:16:01,070
You don't think?

355
00:16:05,080 --> 00:16:08,150
I actually like this camouflage-like look.

356
00:16:08,150 --> 00:16:14,150
And how the camouflage is not that obvious.

357
00:16:14,150 --> 00:16:16,620
Not bad at all

358
00:16:16,020 --> 00:16:17,120
Ah, thanks.

359
00:16:16,990 --> 00:16:18,390
Wait, let's see it on.

360
00:16:18,390 --> 00:16:20,890
Seems good

361
00:16:20,260 --> 00:16:22,560
Size is perfect

362
00:16:21,130 --> 00:16:23,760
Yes it's perfect.

363
00:16:23,760 --> 00:16:29,230
I could totally arrive anywhere
saying "good morning" with this one

364
00:16:27,200 --> 00:16:29,230
Yes it's perfect.

365
00:16:29,230 --> 00:16:34,210
Next is Tanaka with a jacket he thinks Matsumoto will like.

366
00:16:37,680 --> 00:16:39,680
This is not bad either.

367
00:16:41,250 --> 00:16:44,220
This is very nice Tanaka!

368
00:16:42,780 --> 00:16:45,950
You see?

369
00:16:45,920 --> 00:16:46,920
No way..

370
00:16:46,680 --> 00:16:49,290
This is good, very nice.

371
00:16:49,690 --> 00:16:53,120
You truly know me

372
00:16:54,660 --> 00:16:56,790
Matsumoto would never wear totally black

373
00:16:56,790 --> 00:17:00,030
Don't make me older than I am!

374
00:17:01,800 --> 00:17:06,800
Matsumoto's partner Hamada will now reveals the jacket he's found.

375
00:17:06,800 --> 00:17:12,310
I found a jacket he could wear doing winter

376
00:17:11,180 --> 00:17:13,180
Oh, really?

377
00:17:11,180 --> 00:17:13,180
This'll be fun.

378
00:17:13,180 --> 00:17:14,680
The jacket?

379
00:17:13,640 --> 00:17:14,680
Yeah, yeah.

380
00:17:18,550 --> 00:17:20,020
Here we go.

381
00:17:21,590 --> 00:17:23,650
Once again camouflage.

382
00:17:23,620 --> 00:17:25,290
I thought so.

383
00:17:27,090 --> 00:17:29,930
Pretty safe when choosing camouflage

384
00:17:28,860 --> 00:17:29,930
Right, yeah.

385
00:17:29,930 --> 00:17:32,030
I thought this was good

386
00:17:32,030 --> 00:17:34,400
And it's covering him well

387
00:17:35,630 --> 00:17:37,000
It's good, right?

388
00:17:38,200 --> 00:17:39,100
What?

389
00:17:40,570 --> 00:17:42,440
It's not bad.

390
00:17:42,510 --> 00:17:43,870
Right?

391
00:17:43,210 --> 00:17:44,440
Huh??

392
00:17:45,680 --> 00:17:48,250
You can't go wrong with that pattern

393
00:17:47,180 --> 00:17:48,250
Right?

394
00:17:48,250 --> 00:17:49,580
Not bad at all

395
00:17:49,580 --> 00:17:50,950
Look, look, see!

396
00:17:50,080 --> 00:17:51,220
Hold on.

397
00:17:51,220 --> 00:17:54,820
Hama-chan this is good!

398
00:17:55,790 --> 00:17:59,260
I could totally wear this

399
00:17:58,990 --> 00:18:01,260
So much you

400
00:18:01,330 --> 00:18:07,330
But which of the 4 is his favorite?!

401
00:18:08,000 --> 00:18:09,930
It's this one!!

402
00:18:11,340 --> 00:18:12,940
Thank you!!

403
00:18:13,670 --> 00:18:15,910
Ma-chan, thank you!!

404
00:18:15,910 --> 00:18:18,710
This is the jacket I would look after in a shop.

405
00:18:18,640 --> 00:18:20,710
You serious??

406
00:18:19,340 --> 00:18:21,980
Yes, something like this

407
00:18:22,180 --> 00:18:24,250
We'll..

408
00:18:24,250 --> 00:18:28,990
So glad you 3 noticed
that i like camouflage

409
00:18:28,990 --> 00:18:31,860
But this one is just making a joke of me

410
00:18:32,190 --> 00:18:39,300
Hōsei has to pay 19,000 yen

411
00:18:32,490 --> 00:18:34,530
Don't make fun of me!

412
00:18:34,530 --> 00:18:36,230
Where did you buy this?

413
00:18:36,230 --> 00:18:39,230
A district in Tokyo know for it's cheap market.

414
00:18:36,230 --> 00:18:39,230
At Ueno?

415
00:18:39,300 --> 00:18:47,300
Last up is the always cardigan wearing Tanaka

416
00:18:50,270 --> 00:18:51,710
That's not it.

417
00:18:50,500 --> 00:18:51,310
What the...

418
00:18:51,310 --> 00:18:53,640
Why so black?

419
00:18:52,310 --> 00:18:53,580
What's with that...

420
00:18:58,380 --> 00:19:00,950
Tanaka is in trouble!!

421
00:19:00,950 --> 00:19:03,850
I don't like seeing Tanaka in so much distress!

422
00:19:03,750 --> 00:19:05,560
Hold on now...

423
00:19:03,850 --> 00:19:06,760
Poor Tanaka!!

424
00:19:05,560 --> 00:19:08,260
Please... just wait!

425
00:19:06,760 --> 00:19:10,190
Tanaka's in deep trouble!!

426
00:19:08,860 --> 00:19:10,160
No, no, no!

427
00:19:10,190 --> 00:19:14,500
Tanaka doesn't wear such cloth.

428
00:19:13,060 --> 00:19:15,570
Just look at him.

429
00:19:15,570 --> 00:19:17,500
It should have a more loose fit.

430
00:19:19,970 --> 00:19:21,970
Too stiff.

431
00:19:21,970 --> 00:19:23,770
Yes, too stiff.

432
00:19:23,770 --> 00:19:26,110
this will fit to any arrangement.

433
00:19:26,110 --> 00:19:28,310
You don't know him at all.

434
00:19:26,880 --> 00:19:28,550
This..

435
00:19:28,550 --> 00:19:31,620
The first shot was this...?

436
00:19:33,150 --> 00:19:38,160
Next is Tanaka's partner Endo with a cardigan.

437
00:19:38,160 --> 00:19:41,460
This is the image I have of him.

438
00:19:41,060 --> 00:19:42,030
Good!

439
00:19:41,830 --> 00:19:43,960
You nailed it.

440
00:19:43,960 --> 00:19:44,860
Nice!

441
00:19:44,860 --> 00:19:47,400
So much Tanaka!

442
00:19:46,600 --> 00:19:49,170
I see, I see.

443
00:19:47,460 --> 00:19:49,170
It's good, real good!

444
00:19:50,830 --> 00:19:52,500
Looking good!

445
00:19:52,840 --> 00:19:55,040
It's perfect for Tanaka!

446
00:19:55,040 --> 00:19:56,810
It fits him

447
00:19:56,810 --> 00:19:58,380
No matter how you look at it,

448
00:19:58,380 --> 00:20:00,810
I really like it.

449
00:19:59,480 --> 00:20:01,810
How does it fit you?

450
00:20:00,810 --> 00:20:05,220
It fits so well.

451
00:20:05,220 --> 00:20:08,520
Looks like it's perfect.

452
00:20:06,450 --> 00:20:08,520
It is.

453
00:20:08,520 --> 00:20:13,520
What cardigan have Hamada found for Tanaka?

454
00:20:13,520 --> 00:20:15,520
I believe this is just right.

455
00:20:21,470 --> 00:20:23,200
Might be good!

456
00:20:23,700 --> 00:20:25,240
It is!

457
00:20:25,240 --> 00:20:27,240
He got it

458
00:20:25,770 --> 00:20:27,910
Hamada-san!

459
00:20:27,910 --> 00:20:30,170
Wow, that's...

460
00:20:29,910 --> 00:20:31,180
Seems good

461
00:20:30,910 --> 00:20:32,640
Wait a sec

462
00:20:32,140 --> 00:20:34,710
It's great!!

463
00:20:36,180 --> 00:20:38,280
Eh!? I see it...

464
00:20:39,550 --> 00:20:42,320
This multiple pattern

465
00:20:42,390 --> 00:20:44,760
The back is different too

466
00:20:46,660 --> 00:20:48,760
Pattern is different.

467
00:20:47,590 --> 00:20:49,860
A messed up cardigan

468
00:20:49,860 --> 00:20:53,430
But Tanaka likes these messed up cardigans

469
00:20:56,330 --> 00:20:57,430
Woah, so Tanaka.

470
00:20:57,400 --> 00:20:58,770
So Tanaka.

471
00:20:59,540 --> 00:21:01,970
No doubt,

472
00:21:01,610 --> 00:21:03,870
That cardigan is especially him.

473
00:21:03,340 --> 00:21:06,740
Exactly

474
00:21:06,740 --> 00:21:11,720
Last up is Matsumoto with a cardigan for Tanaka

475
00:21:14,750 --> 00:21:16,220
Yep!

476
00:21:16,220 --> 00:21:19,860
Looks like he got it.

477
00:21:21,860 --> 00:21:23,030
This one's good.

478
00:21:23,030 --> 00:21:24,830
Look!

479
00:21:23,760 --> 00:21:25,300
I get it!

480
00:21:25,300 --> 00:21:27,000
He gets it!

481
00:21:26,330 --> 00:21:28,500
I see.

482
00:21:27,830 --> 00:21:28,970
Right??

483
00:21:28,970 --> 00:21:32,370
Yes, yes...

484
00:21:30,700 --> 00:21:32,370
You understand him.

485
00:21:32,370 --> 00:21:35,440
Tanaka is always wearing these bright colors.

486
00:21:35,440 --> 00:21:39,280
This is what I'd propose for Tanaka anytime.

487
00:21:41,610 --> 00:21:43,850
Oh god, this is a tough one

488
00:21:43,850 --> 00:21:46,280
A tough one.

489
00:21:48,390 --> 00:21:50,320
Perfect cardigan.

490
00:21:51,720 --> 00:21:53,220
It's great on him.

491
00:21:53,220 --> 00:21:56,330
Yes, it's so Tanaka, the size is perfect too.

492
00:21:55,130 --> 00:21:58,200
Nobody but Tanaka could wear that cardigan.

493
00:21:58,200 --> 00:22:00,300
This cardigan cannot rest in peace
(if Tanaka doesn't wear it)

494
00:22:00,300 --> 00:22:05,300
But which cardigan does Tanaka choose?!

495
00:22:05,300 --> 00:22:07,070
Can i pick the worst?

496
00:22:07,070 --> 00:22:08,110
This one.

497
00:22:08,370 --> 00:22:09,610
Truly horrible.

498
00:22:09,610 --> 00:22:13,380
Truly bad.

499
00:22:09,970 --> 00:22:16,380
Hôsei has to pay 24,570 yen

500
00:22:14,010 --> 00:22:16,250
Not this one, no way, nope.

501
00:22:16,380 --> 00:22:18,580
As for the rest, I like them all!

502
00:22:18,580 --> 00:22:23,420
But I can boil them down to 2.

503
00:22:23,420 --> 00:22:28,690
I like them, but have to put one aside.

504
00:22:28,030 --> 00:22:29,330
Go ahead.

505
00:22:29,330 --> 00:22:30,960
And that's endo's.

506
00:22:29,890 --> 00:22:31,630
Saw it coming.

507
00:22:31,630 --> 00:22:32,830
I like it...

508
00:22:31,630 --> 00:22:33,430
I understand it too.

509
00:22:33,400 --> 00:22:37,200
I like it, but... I want it to be more relaxed.

510
00:22:36,370 --> 00:22:38,340
Yes, of course

511
00:22:37,200 --> 00:22:38,340
Ah, I see.

512
00:22:38,340 --> 00:22:39,600
Can i just say this?

513
00:22:39,600 --> 00:22:42,610
I asked the shopassistant if they didn't have something a little bigger

514
00:22:42,610 --> 00:22:43,740
But this is all they had

515
00:22:43,740 --> 00:22:46,240
You asked, huh?

516
00:22:44,640 --> 00:22:46,240
I did

517
00:22:45,480 --> 00:22:49,710
What the heck!?

518
00:22:47,440 --> 00:22:49,710
What kind of conversation is that?!!

519
00:22:49,710 --> 00:22:54,720
Which cardigan does Tanaka like the best?!

520
00:22:54,720 --> 00:22:57,450
The cardigan I want is...

521
00:22:59,160 --> 00:23:00,990
This one!

522
00:22:59,690 --> 00:23:01,490
Yeah!!

523
00:23:01,490 --> 00:23:03,030
Mhm, it's good.

524
00:23:03,660 --> 00:23:05,300
It suits Tanaka.

525
00:23:05,300 --> 00:23:08,100
But I want to buy this one

526
00:23:08,300 --> 00:23:10,170
Ah, yea, yea.

527
00:23:09,070 --> 00:23:12,820
I would by this.. immediately

528
00:23:11,140 --> 00:23:12,200
I see.

529
00:23:12,820 --> 00:23:17,900
This is the best, because...

530
00:23:17,880 --> 00:23:20,110
The design

531
00:23:18,700 --> 00:23:20,180
You like the design

532
00:23:20,180 --> 00:23:24,280
This is the cardigan that is most me

533
00:23:24,280 --> 00:23:25,620
So the loser is...

534
00:23:26,420 --> 00:23:28,020
Yama-chan!

535
00:23:27,650 --> 00:23:29,020
Gonna be expensive.

536
00:23:28,520 --> 00:23:31,260
That's an expensive one Tanaka!

537
00:23:29,950 --> 00:23:32,890
24,570 yen

538
00:23:32,890 --> 00:23:34,830
Can we just do that?

539
00:23:34,830 --> 00:23:36,330
Yea...

540
00:23:35,130 --> 00:23:38,500
And he just takes it from the wallet.

541
00:23:38,500 --> 00:23:40,400
How much in total?

542
00:23:40,400 --> 00:23:42,870
48,245 yen! (around 480$)

543
00:23:42,870 --> 00:23:46,040
I though he had a better eye for fashion.

544
00:23:46,040 --> 00:23:49,140
It honestly hurts!

545
00:23:49,140 --> 00:23:50,710
Hurts, huh?

546
00:23:50,370 --> 00:23:52,480
Yes really!

547
00:23:52,340 --> 00:23:53,680
Really.

548
00:23:52,710 --> 00:23:54,310
Seriously, right?
