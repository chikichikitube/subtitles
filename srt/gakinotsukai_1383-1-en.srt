00:00:00,440 --> 00:00:02,880
First time on Gaki No Tsukai Ya Arahende CHIKI CHIKI

2
00:00:00,440 --> 00:00:11,070
TN: The guest for this episode (ぺえ) is someone that describes themselves as a "genderless man".

3
00:00:02,880 --> 00:00:05,550
"I'm the one who understands them the best..."

4
00:00:05,550 --> 00:00:11,070
"Anyways, you'd look great in this thing" - Peey edition!

5
00:00:15,100 --> 00:00:19,210
He was so loud I couldn't tell what he said. His voice broke.

6
00:00:17,320 --> 00:00:19,210
His voice broke.

7
00:00:19,210 --> 00:00:22,060
It was quite loud, quite loud indeed.

8
00:00:22,060 --> 00:00:24,440
He couldn't control it.

9
00:00:23,570 --> 00:00:26,370
That's a bit too far.

10
00:00:26,370 --> 00:00:28,170
I feel bad for Hamada now.

11
00:00:28,360 --> 00:00:29,320
I'm surpri-

12
00:00:29,320 --> 00:00:30,380
Ow owowowow

13
00:00:30,380 --> 00:00:32,350
He's trying so hard to do his best.

14
00:00:32,350 --> 00:00:33,720
I'm sorry.

15
00:00:32,350 --> 00:00:33,720
You shouldn't talk to him like that.

16
00:00:33,720 --> 00:00:36,590
We've done nine people so far...

17
00:00:36,590 --> 00:00:38,690
...so he will be the tenth.

18
00:00:38,720 --> 00:00:41,090
Wow, we've done that many?

19
00:00:41,900 --> 00:00:49,420
A special series on Gaki, where the members buy gifts for guests based on their interests.

20
00:00:49,830 --> 00:00:54,950
I don't think this one was that difficult.

21
00:00:52,170 --> 00:00:54,950
Eh, really?

22
00:00:54,950 --> 00:01:00,910
Cause, basically, if it's colorful or furry it's good enough.

23
00:00:58,810 --> 00:01:00,910
That's a bit too simple.

24
00:01:00,910 --> 00:01:03,520
Let's introduce the guest, come on out!

25
00:01:07,260 --> 00:01:10,080
Hello, nice to meet you all!

26
00:01:11,960 --> 00:01:15,850
Today you came in a sort of plain style today on purpose? Relatively, relatively.

27
00:01:15,850 --> 00:01:18,960
Since I will be dressed by you.

28
00:01:18,960 --> 00:01:24,840
It's not really that plain. But your normal style is even more flashy than this.

29
00:01:24,840 --> 00:01:29,700
But I didn't think your fashion was that hard to understand.

30
00:01:29,700 --> 00:01:34,640
I've never even bought clothes recommended by someone else before.

31
00:01:33,200 --> 00:01:34,640
I see.

32
00:01:37,240 --> 00:01:40,150
So today, if one of you gets a strike...

33
00:01:40,150 --> 00:01:45,150
...I want to take you home along with the clothes.

34
00:01:45,320 --> 00:01:49,590
You know, about the state of your body...

35
00:01:49,590 --> 00:01:51,840
I'm not really sure I understand it.

36
00:01:52,330 --> 00:01:55,590
You don't have boobs right?

37
00:01:53,530 --> 00:01:55,590
Ahn~ ♥

38
00:01:55,590 --> 00:01:58,600
That was your real voice just now.

39
00:02:02,420 --> 00:02:07,040

Translated by senor_wristband

40
00:02:09,660 --> 00:02:16,780
Before the filming, the five think of different shops to buy a top and an accessory for Peey.

41
00:02:17,000 --> 00:02:20,540
That guy wears a lot of decorations.

42
00:02:21,360 --> 00:02:26,760
For this sort of thing I could just close my eyes and grab one.

43
00:02:27,290 --> 00:02:30,040
All of these work. All of em.

44
00:02:31,280 --> 00:02:33,080
What's with that guy?

45
00:02:34,270 --> 00:02:36,670
But, this type...

46
00:02:36,670 --> 00:02:39,980
...it's alright to have this part uncovered, right?

47
00:02:39,980 --> 00:02:44,080
You can have it uncovered right?

48
00:02:41,050 --> 00:02:44,080
Yes, you can, yes.

49
00:02:44,270 --> 00:02:46,620
I think this would be a good accessory.

50
00:02:46,620 --> 00:02:51,480
Other ones ... well not these ones, these decorations don't work.

51
00:02:51,480 --> 00:02:55,820
He's so flashy, so conversely maybe something to remind him he's a man.

52
00:02:56,890 --> 00:03:01,800
Something that says ,"you're a man, right?"

53
00:03:01,800 --> 00:03:06,120
Peey-kun doesn't ever wear Japanese style.

54
00:03:06,120 --> 00:03:09,840
So I took a challenge, because I think Japanese style would work.

55
00:03:10,220 --> 00:03:12,360
A flashy one would be good.

56
00:03:12,750 --> 00:03:14,090
What is this?

57
00:03:14,090 --> 00:03:16,460
This is a coat.

58
00:03:16,620 --> 00:03:19,150
Incidentally...  Looks expensive.

59
00:03:19,600 --> 00:03:22,590
But, but, it's 15,800 yen.

60
00:03:22,780 --> 00:03:26,350
You know this, but if you're last place...

61
00:03:24,840 --> 00:03:26,350
That's true.

62
00:03:26,350 --> 00:03:30,590
If you come last, you pay with your own money...

63
00:03:30,590 --> 00:03:36,090
Honestly...There's just something about paying for Peey, I'm sorry...

64
00:03:36,250 --> 00:03:39,100
His fashion is quite flashy right?

65
00:03:39,320 --> 00:03:41,630
A strong impression of pink.

66
00:03:41,630 --> 00:03:45,070
The impression of pink is really strong.

67
00:03:45,310 --> 00:03:48,280
This seems like something he would wear too.

68
00:03:48,670 --> 00:03:50,280
Damn this is hard.

69
00:03:54,510 --> 00:03:55,870
What is this?

70
00:03:55,870 --> 00:04:00,040
It's a thing kids in America ride on.

71
00:03:58,330 --> 00:04:00,040
Ah! They play like this?

72
00:04:00,040 --> 00:04:01,280
Like this?

73
00:04:02,890 --> 00:04:06,690
This kind of thing? Oh, this could make a good gift too.

74
00:04:06,920 --> 00:04:09,360
So, we're here, Village Vanguard.

75
00:04:09,360 --> 00:04:12,090
I think this store is a challenge.

76
00:04:12,490 --> 00:04:14,090
This is great too.

77
00:04:15,500 --> 00:04:18,270
Peey-kun probably likes this kinda thing right?

78
00:04:22,370 --> 00:04:23,880
Wow, this is awesome.

79
00:04:30,510 --> 00:04:32,540
This could be good too.

80
00:04:32,680 --> 00:04:34,680
Is that for sale too?

81
00:04:34,720 --> 00:04:37,760
Is this for sale? How much is it?

82
00:04:39,640 --> 00:04:40,910
30K.

83
00:04:40,910 --> 00:04:43,230
30K huh...

84
00:04:43,230 --> 00:04:47,100
It's gonna hurt if he says he doesn't want it.

85
00:04:47,580 --> 00:04:51,500
Like, something fluffly and colorful should be good right?

86
00:04:54,200 --> 00:04:55,610
Something like this?

87
00:04:57,390 --> 00:04:58,300
Right?

88
00:04:58,910 --> 00:05:00,190
What is this?

89
00:05:04,330 --> 00:05:06,740
Is this not good?

90
00:05:06,960 --> 00:05:10,860
No of course, I wouldn't wear it.

91
00:05:10,860 --> 00:05:13,730
Unless I'm in an incredibly good mood.

92
00:05:14,110 --> 00:05:15,440
This is good too.

93
00:05:17,550 --> 00:05:19,000
The feel-

94
00:05:20,100 --> 00:05:23,900
This is so heavy, of course, as if to bully you,

95
00:05:23,940 --> 00:05:26,440
They put chains in there.

96
00:05:29,450 --> 00:05:33,120
This is so malicious, because this is so heavy.

97
00:05:33,850 --> 00:05:37,820
Peey will take the item he likes most home with him.

98
00:05:37,820 --> 00:05:41,600
Whomever comes in last must pay for their item with their own money.

99
00:05:41,660 --> 00:05:45,680
First off a top that would look good on Peey.

100
00:05:46,620 --> 00:05:49,760
I think I went on the offensive here.

101
00:05:49,760 --> 00:05:56,970
If you don't do that, it's like, the surface tension is just barely holding you back.

102
00:05:56,970 --> 00:06:01,880
You can't fall back.

103
00:05:58,970 --> 00:06:01,880
You can't fall back.

104
00:06:02,830 --> 00:06:06,410
First off, Tanaka presents his top.

105
00:06:06,410 --> 00:06:09,300
I think I really took a risk here.

106
00:06:08,120 --> 00:06:09,300
You gotta take a risk.

107
00:06:09,300 --> 00:06:14,940
And I chose the one which I think will make him the most happy.

108
00:06:13,480 --> 00:06:14,940
Of course of course.

109
00:06:14,920 --> 00:06:17,590
I have a lot of confidence in this!!

110
00:06:16,400 --> 00:06:17,590
Thank you very much.

111
00:06:17,590 --> 00:06:20,300
'cause if you think about it, buying plain stuff is a waste.

112
00:06:20,300 --> 00:06:22,960
Well the first facial impressions...

113
00:06:21,550 --> 00:06:22,960
Uwah, what is that?

114
00:06:22,960 --> 00:06:24,780
Well, you know, I...

115
00:06:24,780 --> 00:06:27,690
...I can understand the fluffy part.

116
00:06:26,350 --> 00:06:27,690
Yes, yes, yes...

117
00:06:27,880 --> 00:06:30,430
It's a jacket.

118
00:06:28,830 --> 00:06:30,430
Yes, yes it is.

119
00:06:31,310 --> 00:06:34,640
He's not into it at all!

120
00:06:32,410 --> 00:06:34,640
See!

121
00:06:33,120 --> 00:06:34,640
He's not into it

122
00:06:35,450 --> 00:06:40,620
Of course, Peey-san wears pink and other vivid colors.

123
00:06:40,620 --> 00:06:46,000
So I thought instead he wouldn't be happy if he got the same thing again.

124
00:06:46,000 --> 00:06:49,770
And he's in the middle of an image change...

125
00:06:49,770 --> 00:06:57,100
...and I thought Peey hasn't bought anything monotone before.

126
00:06:57,450 --> 00:07:02,090
And this fluffiness keeps the body lines.

127
00:07:02,090 --> 00:07:02,730
No no no...

128
00:07:02,730 --> 00:07:04,870
He has no confidence so he keeps talking.

129
00:07:05,150 --> 00:07:11,220
Someone who goes to the park and listens to the radio all the time would wear that coat.

130
00:07:12,110 --> 00:07:13,240
No no...

131
00:07:14,010 --> 00:07:17,760
Next, the top Endo chose.

132
00:07:18,000 --> 00:07:19,720
This bag is cute!

133
00:07:19,720 --> 00:07:22,810
It starts from the bag of course, thank you very much.

134
00:07:23,050 --> 00:07:26,030
If he thinks that cute then I have no idea what cute means.

135
00:07:26,650 --> 00:07:27,710
What's that?

136
00:07:28,330 --> 00:07:30,220
The brightness on his face.

137
00:07:30,220 --> 00:07:31,760
Ah, spread it out.

138
00:07:32,220 --> 00:07:32,990
Yes.

139
00:07:33,150 --> 00:07:34,080
What is that?

140
00:07:34,460 --> 00:07:36,190
You can wear it if you want.

141
00:07:36,700 --> 00:07:38,190
What is that?

142
00:07:38,190 --> 00:07:41,400
You don't really wear Japanese style clothes right?

143
00:07:41,400 --> 00:07:44,380
But there's a lot of stuff with Japanese style...

144
00:07:44,380 --> 00:07:47,900
I think this one will actually look good on Peey-san.

145
00:07:47,910 --> 00:07:50,450
It's not even funny.

146
00:07:50,780 --> 00:07:52,280
That's the worst.

147
00:07:52,280 --> 00:07:54,330
What do you mean "it's not funny"?

148
00:07:54,330 --> 00:07:56,000
I genuinely think it suits him.

149
00:07:56,000 --> 00:07:58,090
What? What is that thing called?

150
00:07:58,160 --> 00:08:02,320
This is from a Kyoto shop, they have one in Tokyo too.

151
00:08:02,320 --> 00:08:05,260
It's like a kimono.

152
00:08:05,260 --> 00:08:07,950
It has nothing to do with Peey.

153
00:08:07,950 --> 00:08:11,520
So you think something like this would also look good?

154
00:08:10,590 --> 00:08:11,520
Yes, yes.

155
00:08:11,520 --> 00:08:12,570
Here, this here.

156
00:08:12,570 --> 00:08:15,410
Interesting.

157
00:08:15,410 --> 00:08:16,670
It's interesting, right?

158
00:08:16,670 --> 00:08:20,280
Interesting really means "I don't like it."

159
00:08:20,280 --> 00:08:22,730
When you don't have something to say you call it interesting.

160
00:08:23,550 --> 00:08:27,210
Next is Hosei's presentation.

161
00:08:27,360 --> 00:08:28,440
Ameli?

162
00:08:28,440 --> 00:08:30,540
The brand is already drawing him in.

163
00:08:30,540 --> 00:08:32,750
That's a cute name.

164
00:08:31,380 --> 00:08:32,750
It really is.

165
00:08:32,920 --> 00:08:34,570
The bag is cute!

166
00:08:34,570 --> 00:08:36,570
Do you know it? Ameli?

167
00:08:36,570 --> 00:08:39,150
Of course it's Ameli!

168
00:08:39,150 --> 00:08:41,240
I have no idea what that is.

169
00:08:41,240 --> 00:08:43,150
I don't know Ameli.

170
00:08:43,230 --> 00:08:44,060
Go ahead.

171
00:08:45,870 --> 00:08:47,040
Hmm?!

172
00:08:47,040 --> 00:08:47,980
This is, right?

173
00:08:47,980 --> 00:08:50,220
It's sleeveless.

174
00:08:49,100 --> 00:08:50,220
Yes indeed.

175
00:08:50,220 --> 00:08:53,120
You can wear it without getting hot.

176
00:08:53,120 --> 00:08:55,910
No no, there's no point in that.

177
00:08:55,910 --> 00:08:58,180
It looks so good on you Peey-chan!

178
00:08:58,180 --> 00:09:00,390
What happened?

179
00:09:00,390 --> 00:09:02,200
I'm amazed!

180
00:09:02,200 --> 00:09:05,490
Wow! This Peey-chan you see from the front...

181
00:09:05,520 --> 00:09:08,660
And the Peey-chan you see from the back is totally different!

182
00:09:10,110 --> 00:09:11,620
What's the point of that?

183
00:09:11,620 --> 00:09:13,640
Is that uneven on purpose?

184
00:09:13,640 --> 00:09:15,450
No, this is actually...

185
00:09:15,470 --> 00:09:17,900
...it's detachable.

186
00:09:18,080 --> 00:09:20,380
This um-

187
00:09:18,920 --> 00:09:20,380
It won't come off.

188
00:09:22,350 --> 00:09:24,110
It comes off, it comes off, for real.

189
00:09:24,110 --> 00:09:27,760
His aging eyes, his eyes...

190
00:09:27,760 --> 00:09:30,420
He just can't see.

191
00:09:30,420 --> 00:09:34,350
Is there a young person here? A young person?

192
00:09:35,070 --> 00:09:38,860
You can tell by looking there isn't a single young person here.

193
00:09:36,970 --> 00:09:38,860
Yeah.

194
00:09:39,630 --> 00:09:43,360
Next, the very confident Matsumoto.

195
00:09:43,790 --> 00:09:45,230
For Peey...

196
00:09:46,140 --> 00:09:49,690
...all the ideas I've had...

197
00:09:49,690 --> 00:09:52,760
..I have to unleash them.

198
00:09:53,240 --> 00:09:57,480
See, you can already see how happy is face is.

199
00:09:57,480 --> 00:10:00,030
See, I've got the colors down.

200
00:09:58,350 --> 00:10:00,030
Wow!

201
00:10:02,410 --> 00:10:05,610
What is that?

202
00:10:03,280 --> 00:10:05,610
It's got an extra pair?

203
00:10:06,110 --> 00:10:08,590
It's like an octopus.

204
00:10:08,590 --> 00:10:12,480
Cute!

205
00:10:09,550 --> 00:10:12,480
See! He's calling it cute!

206
00:10:12,680 --> 00:10:14,170
See!

207
00:10:14,780 --> 00:10:18,110
On purpose these are useless.

208
00:10:18,110 --> 00:10:19,240
What is this?!

209
00:10:19,240 --> 00:10:21,040
You don't put your legs in here.

210
00:10:21,040 --> 00:10:23,270
It's a Nininbaori thing!

211
00:10:21,040 --> 00:10:25,270
TN: Nininbaori is when two people wear one coat.

212
00:10:23,270 --> 00:10:25,270
It's for two people!

213
00:10:25,270 --> 00:10:27,770
It's this kinda thing, isn't it cool? The colors too!

214
00:10:27,770 --> 00:10:30,480
It's so exciting!

215
00:10:28,680 --> 00:10:31,290
He said it's exciting!!!!

216
00:10:31,290 --> 00:10:32,520
Like this?

217
00:10:35,610 --> 00:10:37,840
Yes. See?

218
00:10:37,840 --> 00:10:38,880
It's good right?

219
00:10:38,880 --> 00:10:41,550
What is this?

220
00:10:40,040 --> 00:10:41,550
Wasn't it better before?

221
00:10:41,870 --> 00:10:46,350
I think either this side, or this side works.

222
00:10:46,600 --> 00:10:49,200
This is a defective product right?

223
00:10:47,850 --> 00:10:49,200
No no no!

224
00:10:49,200 --> 00:10:52,670
Try wearing the lower one, that could be another style.

225
00:10:52,840 --> 00:10:55,630
Put it in the lower one.

226
00:10:55,630 --> 00:10:57,480
Yes yes yes.

227
00:10:56,120 --> 00:10:57,480
This one?

228
00:10:57,480 --> 00:11:00,990
How will it turn out?

229
00:10:59,640 --> 00:11:00,990
Crazy!

230
00:11:01,130 --> 00:11:03,470
Like this.

231
00:11:02,280 --> 00:11:03,470
That's strange.

232
00:11:05,390 --> 00:11:07,600
Put this in the front.

233
00:11:08,000 --> 00:11:10,540
Ehh!? What is this!?

234
00:11:09,520 --> 00:11:10,540
Hold on.

235
00:11:10,540 --> 00:11:11,470
Wow!

236
00:11:11,470 --> 00:11:14,140
You could tie it like this.

237
00:11:14,220 --> 00:11:16,840
So cute!!

238
00:11:16,840 --> 00:11:19,370
It's hella cute!

239
00:11:19,370 --> 00:11:21,930
It's hella cute ain't it?!

240
00:11:22,830 --> 00:11:25,020
You can't move properly.

241
00:11:28,160 --> 00:11:31,720
Hamada is the last to present his top.

242
00:11:31,790 --> 00:11:34,760
Everyone else appealed to the feminine style...

243
00:11:34,760 --> 00:11:36,860
...but I, on purpose, did the opposite.

244
00:11:36,860 --> 00:11:38,110
That bag...

245
00:11:38,110 --> 00:11:40,180
It's for old men.

246
00:11:40,180 --> 00:11:43,950
Maybe you should try dressing like this instead?

247
00:11:43,950 --> 00:11:47,680
If you don't mix things up, you can't blend in.

248
00:11:49,100 --> 00:11:51,420
This is scary. What is that?

249
00:11:52,890 --> 00:11:54,520
Oh dear, he's gone and done it.

250
00:11:54,520 --> 00:11:56,560
Yes, thank you very much.

251
00:11:56,560 --> 00:12:00,230
That belongs to Onigawara Gonzo!! (Beat Takeshi)

252
00:12:01,280 --> 00:12:04,440
He's messed it all up.

253
00:12:04,440 --> 00:12:09,100
He thought too much and ended up with a bad idea.

254
00:12:08,170 --> 00:12:09,100
No no no...

255
00:12:09,100 --> 00:12:12,940
I thought on the contrary a masculine style would be good.

256
00:12:10,920 --> 00:12:12,940
That face.

257
00:12:12,940 --> 00:12:16,750
I want the smile I inspired in him to come back.

258
00:12:17,630 --> 00:12:19,580
It's so different from before.

259
00:12:21,710 --> 00:12:26,360
Which of these tops does Peey like best?

260
00:12:26,390 --> 00:12:28,990
Have you decided on #1?

261
00:12:27,610 --> 00:12:28,990
Yes, I have.

262
00:12:28,990 --> 00:12:30,270
Alright, let's go.

263
00:12:30,270 --> 00:12:34,360
Which one of these, is number one?

264
00:12:36,570 --> 00:12:38,250
The one you can wear.

265
00:12:38,250 --> 00:12:38,830
This!

266
00:12:38,830 --> 00:12:42,240
YEAHHHH!!

267
00:12:42,840 --> 00:12:44,240
I don't get it.

268
00:12:44,520 --> 00:12:45,580
This one!

269
00:12:46,230 --> 00:12:49,660
I really think the colors, and the innovative style of the arms...

270
00:12:49,660 --> 00:12:53,870
...and how this feels worn and loose.

271
00:12:52,330 --> 00:12:53,480
Oh yes yes yes.

272
00:12:53,870 --> 00:12:55,690
It's on purpose.

273
00:12:55,690 --> 00:12:58,870
Really advanced fashion.

274
00:12:58,870 --> 00:13:00,260
Understood

275
00:13:04,320 --> 00:13:06,570
And which is #2?

276
00:13:07,000 --> 00:13:09,610
YEAHHH!!!

277
00:13:09,820 --> 00:13:10,840
No way...

278
00:13:11,340 --> 00:13:15,270
It's exciting to think about how I can wear this.

279
00:13:13,640 --> 00:13:15,270
Thank you very much.

280
00:13:15,270 --> 00:13:18,540
Fine, what about how mine can be worn?

281
00:13:18,540 --> 00:13:20,710
Only someone with advanced fashion can wear it!!

282
00:13:20,710 --> 00:13:24,850
All you can wear with that are work gloves and work pants!

283
00:13:23,210 --> 00:13:24,840
That's the only outfit.

284
00:13:24,840 --> 00:13:28,250
Work gloves, work pants, and cheap cigarettes, that's it!!

285
00:13:28,250 --> 00:13:30,880
Peey you should show your skills!

286
00:13:32,690 --> 00:13:34,930
All you can hold in your hand is BOSS Coffee.

287
00:13:32,690 --> 00:13:34,930
TN: BOSS is sold from vending machines.

288
00:13:34,930 --> 00:13:37,600
Let's see third place, have you decided?

289
00:13:37,600 --> 00:13:39,390
Yes, I've decided.

290
00:13:39,390 --> 00:13:43,070
Let's continue...Which one is number three?

291
00:13:44,830 --> 00:13:47,120
Please, please.

292
00:13:45,450 --> 00:13:47,120
It's between two.

293
00:13:47,900 --> 00:13:48,540
This!

294
00:13:48,540 --> 00:13:50,880
YEAHHHH!!

295
00:13:52,280 --> 00:13:55,870
No, no - this is messed up.

296
00:13:53,900 --> 00:13:55,870
No, no way, Peey.

297
00:13:55,870 --> 00:13:58,490
C'mon.

298
00:13:58,620 --> 00:14:00,920
Good work today!

299
00:14:00,920 --> 00:14:04,040
Stop it! Stop it! He's the one who decided!

300
00:14:04,040 --> 00:14:06,040
That's number three.

301
00:14:07,460 --> 00:14:11,360
That's you guessing their feelings.

302
00:14:14,320 --> 00:14:16,300
Peey tell em, tell em why.

303
00:14:16,300 --> 00:14:20,340
If I put some patches on this and make it colorful...

304
00:14:20,340 --> 00:14:22,310
...I want to try decorating it.

305
00:14:22,310 --> 00:14:25,810
It's actually quite appropriate if you think about it.

306
00:14:24,220 --> 00:14:25,810
I want to make this fashionable.

307
00:14:26,810 --> 00:14:31,220
Which top did Peey like least?

308
00:14:31,220 --> 00:14:32,700
Please think this through.

309
00:14:32,700 --> 00:14:34,170
Seriously think about it.

310
00:14:34,170 --> 00:14:36,400
Ignore their standing in the comedy world.

311
00:14:36,400 --> 00:14:39,960
Ignore anything about them as comedians.

312
00:14:39,960 --> 00:14:43,660
Cause in that case this guy is right out.

313
00:14:41,720 --> 00:14:43,660
HEY!

314
00:14:43,660 --> 00:14:47,200
I'm not out!! I'm a rakugoka now!!

315
00:14:48,670 --> 00:14:52,110
So, who will pay for their purchase?

316
00:14:52,110 --> 00:14:53,880
I don't want this.

317
00:14:54,040 --> 00:14:55,880
Which one?!

318
00:14:56,320 --> 00:14:57,360
The worst one.

319
00:15:00,160 --> 00:15:02,640
How many times have I come last?!

320
00:15:03,560 --> 00:15:05,840
For real, so many times.

321
00:15:05,840 --> 00:15:08,320
It's like it's me everytime!

322
00:15:06,920 --> 00:15:08,320
The reason please.

323
00:15:08,320 --> 00:15:11,870
As soon as I saw this, I knew anything else would be better.

324
00:15:11,870 --> 00:15:14,530
Right away? Even without seeing the others?

325
00:15:14,530 --> 00:15:17,860
I kinda disliked how you tried too hard to pander to me.

326
00:15:17,860 --> 00:15:19,960
In my head I was going on the offensive.

327
00:15:20,130 --> 00:15:23,670
It's like he was saying
"Besides, you like this crap right?"

328
00:15:23,670 --> 00:15:27,370
Like "Let's just serve the kids hamburgers."

329
00:15:27,370 --> 00:15:29,000
That's not true.

330
00:15:29,580 --> 00:15:34,080
Tanaka has to pay 32,184 yen from his own pocket!!

331
00:15:34,830 --> 00:15:41,050
Next, an accessory for Peey. Endo is the first to present.

332
00:15:41,050 --> 00:15:44,890
So, I just simply want to hand this over.

333
00:15:46,400 --> 00:15:48,460
It's a cheesecake.

334
00:15:49,280 --> 00:15:52,120
A cheesecake.

335
00:15:52,280 --> 00:15:54,680
Again...

336
00:15:52,750 --> 00:15:54,680
Peey-chan's face...

337
00:15:54,680 --> 00:15:55,640
Well...

338
00:15:55,640 --> 00:15:58,040
They are just sunglasses.

339
00:15:58,040 --> 00:16:02,960
Yes, they're Ray Bans, the standard ones.

340
00:16:04,400 --> 00:16:07,340
I wonder how this will turn out...

341
00:16:07,340 --> 00:16:11,000
See? It just straight up looks good. It suits him so well.

342
00:16:11,000 --> 00:16:14,700
It works only if you have those stars in the background.

343
00:16:16,180 --> 00:16:17,860
I really think it suits him!

344
00:16:19,460 --> 00:16:22,760
There's no way he's taking that home.

345
00:16:20,500 --> 00:16:22,760
It's too out there.

346
00:16:22,990 --> 00:16:25,250
How about upside down? It totally works!

347
00:16:34,040 --> 00:16:37,700
Next, an accessory from Hamada.

348
00:16:37,700 --> 00:16:40,080
I'm not sure if he already has this.

349
00:16:40,080 --> 00:16:41,580
This is a cheap store.

350
00:16:42,720 --> 00:16:44,940
Like, "maybe let's just try it on."

351
00:16:46,140 --> 00:16:46,800
I'm scared.

352
00:16:49,420 --> 00:16:50,500
What?

353
00:16:50,500 --> 00:16:52,920
Yup, he did it again.

354
00:16:53,500 --> 00:16:55,500
Hamada-san is in a slump today.

355
00:16:55,500 --> 00:16:57,240
I'm not in a slump!

356
00:16:57,240 --> 00:16:59,940
What happened?

357
00:16:58,500 --> 00:16:59,940
It's a spiky bra!

358
00:17:00,140 --> 00:17:03,280
Cause he doesn't need a bra right?

359
00:17:03,280 --> 00:17:07,900
But it's something that he can wear as a top, above a t-shirt or something.

360
00:17:12,090 --> 00:17:14,430
Please try that on.

361
00:17:15,700 --> 00:17:18,180
What're you smiling for?

362
00:17:16,340 --> 00:17:18,180
He looks happy.

363
00:17:19,040 --> 00:17:21,060
Well, it's...

364
00:17:21,060 --> 00:17:24,540
It's not totally unflattering.

365
00:17:23,540 --> 00:17:24,540
It's good!

366
00:17:25,620 --> 00:17:28,240
He can coordinate it with different outfits.

367
00:17:28,780 --> 00:17:31,420
Interesting, this might not be bad.

368
00:17:30,480 --> 00:17:31,420
Right?

369
00:17:33,600 --> 00:17:35,640
But how is it really?

370
00:17:37,660 --> 00:17:39,590
Even if you do that...

371
00:17:39,960 --> 00:17:41,900
What are you doing?!

372
00:17:41,480 --> 00:17:42,720
C'mon, touch it touch it.

373
00:17:41,900 --> 00:17:42,720
Alright alright.

374
00:17:42,720 --> 00:17:46,160
What is this interaction?

375
00:17:48,320 --> 00:17:51,380
Next, will Tanaka make a comeback?

376
00:17:54,440 --> 00:17:57,260
Something like this, it transcends imagination.

377
00:18:04,240 --> 00:18:05,580
What is that?!

378
00:18:05,580 --> 00:18:07,580
It's a bag.

379
00:18:07,580 --> 00:18:12,420
This, yes! Like that.

380
00:18:15,420 --> 00:18:17,760
This is a bag!

381
00:18:18,200 --> 00:18:21,460
You can wear it on your shoulder, or just carry it.

382
00:18:21,460 --> 00:18:23,080
You can wear it too.

383
00:18:23,080 --> 00:18:27,220
Give him a bag to hide that bag in.

384
00:18:27,220 --> 00:18:29,580
Give him something to hide that bag in.

385
00:18:29,580 --> 00:18:31,940
Where do you put stuff in?

386
00:18:31,220 --> 00:18:31,940
Here?

387
00:18:32,180 --> 00:18:34,880
It has a zipper.

388
00:18:33,710 --> 00:18:34,880
It looks too small.

389
00:18:34,880 --> 00:18:36,060
It's way too small.

390
00:18:36,310 --> 00:18:37,940
It's fine if nothing fits!

391
00:18:37,940 --> 00:18:42,520
Who the hell is speaking too?

392
00:18:39,240 --> 00:18:42,520
Everyone here is your senior, what are you doing man?

393
00:18:43,300 --> 00:18:46,420
Matsumoto presents his accessory.

394
00:18:47,020 --> 00:18:49,280
Interesting bag.

395
00:18:48,100 --> 00:18:49,980
Yes the bag is interesting.

396
00:18:49,280 --> 00:18:51,280
What the...

397
00:18:49,980 --> 00:18:51,280
It's super cute!

398
00:18:56,160 --> 00:18:57,260
Finally!

399
00:18:58,100 --> 00:18:59,260
What the hell is that?!

400
00:18:59,260 --> 00:19:01,000
It's a flamingo cap.

401
00:19:01,000 --> 00:19:02,580
Flamingo cap?

402
00:19:02,580 --> 00:19:04,250
It's just a flamingo.

403
00:19:05,500 --> 00:19:07,580
The pink and pink clash....

404
00:19:07,580 --> 00:19:09,880
Those legs are a pain!

405
00:19:09,880 --> 00:19:14,020
No no, they're super cute. They're like, like piercings.

406
00:19:14,300 --> 00:19:16,120
Like earrings, exactly.

407
00:19:17,860 --> 00:19:22,420
It's the first time I've seen a hat like this.

408
00:19:18,960 --> 00:19:22,420
It's for those times when you feel like wearing a flamingo.

409
00:19:22,540 --> 00:19:26,120
You've never wanted to do that right Peey-chan?

410
00:19:24,360 --> 00:19:26,080
Nobody feels like doing that.

411
00:19:26,360 --> 00:19:27,930
AH! Backwards is good too!

412
00:19:27,930 --> 00:19:30,740
BACKWARDS IS GOOD!!

413
00:19:30,740 --> 00:19:33,530
It's like a topknot.

414
00:19:34,960 --> 00:19:36,130
Wow!

415
00:19:36,780 --> 00:19:39,020
I never thought of doing that.

416
00:19:39,220 --> 00:19:40,220
It works! It works!

417
00:19:42,880 --> 00:19:45,640
Last is Hosei's accessory.

418
00:19:46,780 --> 00:19:48,160
Please, bring it out.

419
00:19:55,240 --> 00:19:58,380
I told you this is not that type of segment!

420
00:19:59,760 --> 00:20:01,900
Take this seriously, do your best!

421
00:20:03,280 --> 00:20:04,720
What happened Peey-chan?

422
00:20:06,340 --> 00:20:07,720
What the hell is this?

423
00:20:08,100 --> 00:20:09,720
It's a body pillow.

424
00:20:10,080 --> 00:20:12,320
That's a salmon.

425
00:20:10,580 --> 00:20:12,320
A pillow.

426
00:20:12,320 --> 00:20:16,700
C'mon try hugging it. It feels awesome.

427
00:20:16,700 --> 00:20:20,020
His face, look at his face please.

428
00:20:20,940 --> 00:20:22,640
It suits Peey-chan so well!

429
00:20:25,350 --> 00:20:27,750
You got it wrong, it's supposed to be an accessory.

430
00:20:29,040 --> 00:20:31,940
Something you wear or bring with you everyday.

431
00:20:32,060 --> 00:20:35,400
Well we've got three creatures, try all of them on.

432
00:20:37,780 --> 00:20:39,580
Wear the flamingo hat.

433
00:20:42,320 --> 00:20:43,860
So cool!

434
00:20:43,860 --> 00:20:45,560
So stylish!

435
00:20:53,940 --> 00:20:59,920
"Besides, You Look Good in this Kinda Thing" Contest!
Which accessory did Peey like most?

436
00:20:59,980 --> 00:21:02,300
So starting with #1.

437
00:21:01,320 --> 00:21:02,300
Yes.

438
00:21:02,300 --> 00:21:05,300
Once you've decided, announce it.

439
00:21:05,460 --> 00:21:07,780
The number one item is...

440
00:21:13,120 --> 00:21:14,320
Thank you!

441
00:21:20,620 --> 00:21:22,360
No no, he likes it!

442
00:21:22,360 --> 00:21:26,280
You wanna appear on his show "Hama-chan Ga!" right?

443
00:21:27,380 --> 00:21:29,640
That's not why he picked it!

444
00:21:30,380 --> 00:21:33,780
When I wore it I thought it was really stylish.

445
00:21:33,780 --> 00:21:35,920
And it would be great to use in bed.

446
00:21:35,920 --> 00:21:38,780
What the hell are your interests?!

447
00:21:39,900 --> 00:21:42,980
Just what the hell do you like?

448
00:21:43,080 --> 00:21:44,980
Number two, please decide number two.

449
00:21:45,500 --> 00:21:47,430
I've decided.

450
00:21:46,240 --> 00:21:47,430
You've decided?

451
00:21:47,520 --> 00:21:49,990
Which one is number two?

452
00:22:03,180 --> 00:22:06,900
Flamingos are really trendy right now.

453
00:22:05,240 --> 00:22:06,900
Exactly.

454
00:22:06,900 --> 00:22:07,890
Did you really know that?

455
00:22:07,890 --> 00:22:14,380
Flamingos are just everywhere in Japan right now. They're all flying here.

456
00:22:14,480 --> 00:22:19,000
It's that kind of trend?

457
00:22:16,400 --> 00:22:19,000
That's not what he meant surely, flamingos flying to Japan.

458
00:22:19,200 --> 00:22:22,990
OK, which one is your third favorite?

459
00:22:23,320 --> 00:22:24,820
What should I do?

460
00:22:25,200 --> 00:22:26,560
It must be hard for him to decide.

461
00:22:28,410 --> 00:22:31,080
Can I actually choose the last one?

462
00:22:31,400 --> 00:22:33,620
So one that's way worse than the others?

463
00:22:33,620 --> 00:22:35,640
Not really.

464
00:22:34,520 --> 00:22:37,840
They're equally bad?

465
00:22:35,640 --> 00:22:37,840
Basically.

466
00:22:37,990 --> 00:22:39,700
What do we do here?  He's already picked the worst one.

467
00:22:39,700 --> 00:22:42,000
Yeah, let's do the worst one now.

468
00:22:44,420 --> 00:22:48,820
So which accessory did Peey like the least?

469
00:22:49,520 --> 00:22:50,920
Here we go!

470
00:22:50,920 --> 00:22:53,260
Which one is the worst?

471
00:22:53,920 --> 00:22:55,660
Please not mine!

472
00:22:54,740 --> 00:22:55,660
Please!

473
00:23:04,860 --> 00:23:07,310
Thank you for having bad taste.

474
00:23:07,310 --> 00:23:11,560
I did think it kind of had a Harajuku vibe...

475
00:23:11,560 --> 00:23:13,200
...but it's just wrong.

476
00:23:13,320 --> 00:23:15,300
Wrong?

477
00:23:13,960 --> 00:23:17,100
You don't understand Harajuku at all.

478
00:23:15,300 --> 00:23:17,100
I'd rather pick something else.

479
00:23:18,280 --> 00:23:20,630
You'd pick THIS?!

480
00:23:22,630 --> 00:23:23,860
Knock that off!

481
00:23:23,990 --> 00:23:25,490
This is good!

482
00:23:25,490 --> 00:23:29,980
You can take that to Hokkaido!

483
00:23:25,860 --> 00:23:29,980
Hokkaido?!
