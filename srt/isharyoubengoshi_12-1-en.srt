1
00:00:00,670 --> 00:00:02,410
Well... it's about another
compensation lawsuit.

2
00:00:02,770 --> 00:00:05,780
The one caught cheating
was my wife, Shiori.

3
00:00:05,780 --> 00:00:09,460
I am Honjo Yayoi-san's legal
representative, Karasuma Keiko.

4
00:00:09,460 --> 00:00:12,260
We are suing for five million yen.

5
00:00:12,320 --> 00:00:15,960
Karasuma Keiko is
Hakamada-sensei's ex-lover.

6
00:00:16,240 --> 00:00:18,290
As I have already explained,
he doesn't stand a chance.

7
00:00:18,450 --> 00:00:20,730
So for this particular case, I think
you should consult a different lawyer.

8
00:00:20,730 --> 00:00:22,750
Because he doesn't stand a chance?

9
00:00:22,750 --> 00:00:24,390
Those aren't Hakamada-sensei's words.

10
00:00:24,680 --> 00:00:27,680
So, I'm going to help that client,

11
00:00:27,680 --> 00:00:29,180
the way that you would do it.

12
00:00:30,900 --> 00:00:32,740
I know I'm overstepping
my bounds, but...

13
00:00:34,350 --> 00:00:36,010
you should be prepared to lose.

14
00:00:41,020 --> 00:00:42,070
Kanae.

15
00:00:42,750 --> 00:00:43,530
What's up?

16
00:00:43,720 --> 00:00:45,990
Hakamada's assistant
Nonomura Kanae

17
00:00:46,440 --> 00:00:48,360
We should fight this.

18
00:00:46,660 --> 00:00:50,060
Kanae's ex-husband
Kurasawa Yoshihito

19
00:00:48,660 --> 00:00:51,300
We can't take this lying down.

20
00:00:51,530 --> 00:00:54,000
Did Hakamada-sensei change his mind?

21
00:00:54,640 --> 00:00:55,560
No.

22
00:00:56,720 --> 00:01:00,620
But, we don't have to rely on him.
There are other ways.

23
00:01:01,420 --> 00:01:02,620
What other ways?

24
00:01:04,440 --> 00:01:07,970
There is one indispensable person
you must have on your side...

25
00:01:08,790 --> 00:01:09,690
First of all,

26
00:01:09,690 --> 00:01:12,170
I need you to convince someone
to be on your side.

27
00:01:12,360 --> 00:01:13,240
My side?

28
00:01:13,580 --> 00:01:14,900
Your wife, Shiori-san.

29
00:01:16,920 --> 00:01:19,570
I think that's going to be difficult.

30
00:01:19,570 --> 00:01:20,130
Huh?

31
00:01:20,450 --> 00:01:21,700
Like I said,

32
00:01:22,100 --> 00:01:23,760
we've been living
separately for a while.

33
00:01:24,280 --> 00:01:27,760
She hasn't answered my calls
since we last saw each other.

34
00:01:28,400 --> 00:01:29,730
I see.

35
00:01:35,500 --> 00:01:36,220
Kanae.

36
00:01:36,680 --> 00:01:37,510
Kanae!

37
00:01:40,680 --> 00:01:42,520
What are you looking for?

38
00:01:42,520 --> 00:01:44,340
Evidence of adultery.

39
00:01:44,340 --> 00:01:45,010
What?

40
00:01:45,010 --> 00:01:47,940
We gather evidence that will
give us the advantage.

41
00:01:47,940 --> 00:01:50,520
I'm looking for evidence that
will give us the advantage,

42
00:01:50,740 --> 00:01:51,880
of when the affair started...

43
00:01:52,010 --> 00:01:54,450
the days and times of the trysts,

44
00:01:54,730 --> 00:01:55,450
and if possible...

45
00:01:55,680 --> 00:01:58,350
maybe even the number of times he's
had physical relationships with her.

46
00:01:58,550 --> 00:01:59,700
But how?

47
00:01:59,700 --> 00:02:04,030
For example, check
Shiori-san's car's GPS history.

48
00:02:04,030 --> 00:02:06,260
Shiori doesn't even have
a driver's license.

49
00:02:07,100 --> 00:02:07,740
Then...

50
00:02:07,740 --> 00:02:09,770
her cell phone and PC email history..

51
00:02:09,770 --> 00:02:12,650
She took her cell and laptop with her.

52
00:02:12,650 --> 00:02:13,900
Oh, I see...

53
00:02:14,060 --> 00:02:18,210
Is evidence like that going
to help us at this stage?

54
00:02:18,210 --> 00:02:20,460
I don't know...

55
00:02:20,460 --> 00:02:24,930
but if we can get details about the affair,
we might find a way to counterattack.

56
00:02:25,160 --> 00:02:27,020
Can I look in Shiori-san's room?

57
00:02:27,310 --> 00:02:27,980
Sure.

58
00:02:29,970 --> 00:02:31,320
You're very thorough.

59
00:02:31,320 --> 00:02:35,390
You can get lots of information
from a single dinner receipt.

60
00:02:35,810 --> 00:02:39,020
Is this the kind of thing you did
when you and I got divorced?

61
00:02:39,480 --> 00:02:41,300
Sort of, yeah.

62
00:02:43,690 --> 00:02:46,000
You've become strong, Kanae.

63
00:02:47,140 --> 00:02:47,890
You think so?

64
00:02:52,010 --> 00:02:54,310
Yoshihito's wife
Kurasawa Shiori

65
00:02:53,030 --> 00:02:54,310
What's going on here?

66
00:02:55,770 --> 00:02:58,380
Why are you snooping in my room?

67
00:02:58,640 --> 00:02:59,990
Shiori...

68
00:03:00,840 --> 00:03:02,280
I thought it was weird

69
00:03:03,130 --> 00:03:05,180
that you went to that
Hakamada lawyer.

70
00:03:05,690 --> 00:03:08,260
It's because you wanted
to see each other, isn't it?

71
00:03:09,120 --> 00:03:09,620
I've had it.

72
00:03:10,310 --> 00:03:12,680
Shiori. Shiori.

73
00:03:12,930 --> 00:03:14,360
You've got it wrong.

74
00:03:14,360 --> 00:03:16,670
Kanae was looking
for evidence for our case.

75
00:03:16,670 --> 00:03:17,690
Evidence?

76
00:03:17,880 --> 00:03:19,400
And what good will that do?

77
00:03:19,400 --> 00:03:21,400
We need whatever information we can get.

78
00:03:21,400 --> 00:03:25,000
Otherwise you'll have to pay
the amount they've set.

79
00:03:27,920 --> 00:03:31,000
I don't care any more how
much the compensation fee is.

80
00:03:31,330 --> 00:03:31,980
What?

81
00:03:33,790 --> 00:03:35,410
You should pay the whole thing.

82
00:03:35,900 --> 00:03:37,730
It's all your fault, after all.

83
00:03:38,990 --> 00:03:42,320
You said you'd make all my wishes
come true if I married you.

84
00:03:42,520 --> 00:03:44,680
You said you were going
to make me happy!

85
00:03:46,610 --> 00:03:48,920
But you had to pay that
woman's compensation...

86
00:03:49,680 --> 00:03:52,600
and because of that,
my life is a disappointment!

87
00:03:54,420 --> 00:03:55,720
If I'd known this would happen...

88
00:03:57,510 --> 00:03:59,270
I never would've married you!

89
00:04:08,890 --> 00:04:10,490
You're completely full of it.

90
00:04:12,770 --> 00:04:14,940
Whenever you open your mouth,
you only talk about money!

91
00:04:15,260 --> 00:04:18,930
You were there with Yoshihito-san
when you got slapped with the lawsuit!

92
00:04:19,370 --> 00:04:22,380
You saw the anguish on
his face, didn't you?!

93
00:04:22,770 --> 00:04:24,860
Didn't you feel anything for him at all?

94
00:04:25,910 --> 00:04:30,510
Shouldn't you be aware of the
serious consequences of adultery?!

95
00:04:36,640 --> 00:04:41,090
The first thing an adulterer
must do is apologize.

96
00:04:41,600 --> 00:04:45,020
And the second thing they
must do is apologize.

97
00:04:46,200 --> 00:04:48,080
The third is more of the same.

98
00:04:49,100 --> 00:04:51,410
You have to keep on apologizing.

99
00:04:53,290 --> 00:04:56,720
However, as far as I know,

100
00:04:57,240 --> 00:05:00,030
you haven't asked Yoshihito-san's
forgiveness even once!

101
00:05:05,690 --> 00:05:07,710
You don't even try to learn
from your mistakes.

102
00:05:07,970 --> 00:05:09,680
Of all the men I have ever met...

103
00:05:10,040 --> 00:05:13,890
you are a "dumb man"
of the highest order.

104
00:05:14,520 --> 00:05:16,080
Of all the people I've met...

105
00:05:16,610 --> 00:05:18,680
you are a dumb woman
of the highest order,

106
00:05:18,980 --> 00:05:23,540
the reigning idiot queen
of all other dumb women.

107
00:05:27,060 --> 00:05:29,880
But, even someone like you

108
00:05:32,120 --> 00:05:34,620
is still precious to him.

109
00:05:36,830 --> 00:05:40,940
Yoshihito-san said he doesn't
want to divorce you.

110
00:05:42,360 --> 00:05:43,170
Huh?

111
00:05:44,280 --> 00:05:47,890
He said he wants to start over,
and have a good marriage.

112
00:05:50,960 --> 00:05:53,440
What matters to you the most?

113
00:05:55,580 --> 00:05:57,170
Give it some serious thought.

114
00:06:11,040 --> 00:06:12,620
For crying out loud...

115
00:06:12,620 --> 00:06:15,340
Why must his ex-wife do
all the talking for him?

116
00:06:26,390 --> 00:06:29,180
The first time he seduced me...

117
00:06:30,130 --> 00:06:33,850
was at a place called Le Breeze
in west Azabu.

118
00:06:34,320 --> 00:06:34,890
What?

119
00:06:35,650 --> 00:06:38,920
I'll tell you everything
about the affair.

120
00:06:40,280 --> 00:06:42,850
If that will help our marriage.

121
00:06:53,340 --> 00:06:54,580
Shiori.

122
00:06:56,570 --> 00:06:58,120
I am so sorry.

123
00:07:01,240 --> 00:07:02,270
I am sorry.

124
00:07:09,430 --> 00:07:11,660
Fujisawa Yoshihito

125
00:07:14,300 --> 00:07:15,160
Hello?

126
00:07:15,680 --> 00:07:16,760
It's Yoshihito.

127
00:07:17,050 --> 00:07:20,540
Sorry I sort of lost it back there.

128
00:07:20,700 --> 00:07:21,560
It's fine.

129
00:07:22,450 --> 00:07:25,140
Thanks to you, Shiori told me
about the man she was seeing.

130
00:07:25,810 --> 00:07:26,450
Huh?

131
00:07:26,770 --> 00:07:28,340
I'm relaying the information to you now.

132
00:07:28,340 --> 00:07:29,570
Can you write it down?

133
00:07:30,260 --> 00:07:31,030
Sure.

134
00:07:32,080 --> 00:07:37,990
The first time they met was at Le Breeze
(French restaurant) in west Azabu.
October: She doesn't remember the day of
the week, but Takashi-san asked her out again.
For about six months afterward, they met
3 or 4 times a month at various times, and
sometimes more often, even once a week,
in Daikanyama, Shibuya, etc.

135
00:07:38,650 --> 00:07:42,060
Attorney
Hakamada Yukio

136
00:07:39,080 --> 00:07:41,460
Good work on the investigation.

137
00:07:42,370 --> 00:07:44,920
I can launch a counterattack
with this material.

138
00:07:46,430 --> 00:07:47,860
I need some more details.

139
00:07:49,460 --> 00:07:51,670
Will you please call
Yoshihito-san and Shiori-san here?

140
00:07:52,660 --> 00:07:53,480
Yes!

The Battle of Fate Between Attorneys! The Final Outcome!

143
00:08:16,930 --> 00:08:18,960
I'm being sued for compensation?

144
00:08:19,350 --> 00:08:20,090
Yes.

145
00:08:20,470 --> 00:08:23,130
He must've found some kind of evidence.

146
00:08:20,730 --> 00:08:24,100
Sieg Law Office attorney
Karasuma Keiko

147
00:08:23,620 --> 00:08:25,200
Any idea what it could be?

148
00:08:25,520 --> 00:08:26,450
No...

149
00:08:25,600 --> 00:08:29,000
Shiori's illicit partner
Honjo Takashi

150
00:08:27,280 --> 00:08:30,720
I always followed your instructions
carefully whenever I saw Shiori.

151
00:08:31,390 --> 00:08:33,140
There should be no problem, then.

152
00:08:33,980 --> 00:08:37,340
Well, it's not anything
I wasn't expecting.

153
00:08:40,350 --> 00:08:42,680
Takashi's wife
Honjo Yayoi

154
00:08:41,490 --> 00:08:42,690
When we first met each other,

155
00:08:42,960 --> 00:08:45,080
Takashi-san said,

156
00:08:46,100 --> 00:08:48,370
"My marriage is over...

157
00:08:48,850 --> 00:08:50,690
Our divorce is a matter of time."

158
00:08:53,050 --> 00:08:56,960
Then, after we started seeing each other,

159
00:08:58,110 --> 00:09:00,420
"I reconciled with my wife recently...

160
00:09:01,450 --> 00:09:04,500
We might not divorce, but do
you still want to see me?"

161
00:09:04,500 --> 00:09:06,700
He asked me that.

162
00:09:07,560 --> 00:09:08,680
I see.

163
00:09:09,470 --> 00:09:14,700
There's a high possibility Karasuma
was advising him at that juncture.

164
00:09:15,260 --> 00:09:16,480
Advising him?

165
00:09:16,990 --> 00:09:18,680
This is only a conjecture,

166
00:09:19,000 --> 00:09:22,630
but Honjo Takashi-san's
relationship to his wife

167
00:09:23,000 --> 00:09:26,050
was already in ruins from
before he met Shiori-san.

168
00:09:27,060 --> 00:09:30,170
They may have already
been discussing divorce.

169
00:09:30,430 --> 00:09:35,330
Takashi-san would have then consulted
his company's advising attorney, Karasuma.

170
00:09:36,050 --> 00:09:39,410
She likely advised him to use
his affair with you, Shiori-san,

171
00:09:39,410 --> 00:09:42,250
to sue you for compensation.

172
00:09:42,250 --> 00:09:45,980
So that's why he said he
reconciled with his wife...

173
00:09:50,620 --> 00:09:54,040
You better not have acted
conspicuously. Did you?

174
00:09:56,780 --> 00:10:00,430
I've been living my life according
to Karasuma-san's instructions.

175
00:10:00,430 --> 00:10:02,220
Something bothering you?

176
00:10:03,810 --> 00:10:04,740
No.

177
00:10:05,650 --> 00:10:07,890
You're getting a divorce
like you wanted.

178
00:10:09,080 --> 00:10:11,630
But if I can't get a
large compensation...

179
00:10:11,630 --> 00:10:14,180
you're the one who'll get
the brunt of the divorce.

180
00:10:14,460 --> 00:10:15,520
But that's not...

181
00:10:17,880 --> 00:10:19,170
I know that.

182
00:10:23,330 --> 00:10:26,700
By the way, how did you typically
keep in contact with Takashi-san?

183
00:10:26,890 --> 00:10:29,570
I mostly just texted him,

184
00:10:30,130 --> 00:10:32,980
but he used the phone most of the time.

185
00:10:33,880 --> 00:10:36,110
That's to avoid a paper trail.

186
00:10:36,770 --> 00:10:39,240
He must've been following
instructions from Karasuma.

187
00:10:39,690 --> 00:10:44,570
That's why the texts looked like
Shiori-san was initiating the trysts.

188
00:10:42,470 --> 00:10:46,270
Take me out for lunch today

189
00:10:42,470 --> 00:10:46,270
Understood.

190
00:10:44,570 --> 00:10:45,530
By the way,

191
00:10:45,850 --> 00:10:48,400
do you have any photos
of you and Takashi-san?

192
00:10:49,180 --> 00:10:50,990
Oh, no...

193
00:10:51,410 --> 00:10:53,950
Takashi-san said
he didn't like pictures.

194
00:10:54,980 --> 00:10:57,040
Also by her instructions, probably.

195
00:10:57,720 --> 00:10:59,360
Preparing for the eventual hearing,

196
00:10:59,360 --> 00:11:01,150
by ensuring there was no
disadvantageous evidence.

197
00:11:01,350 --> 00:11:06,770
In other words, he was using
Shiori to get compensation?

198
00:11:07,350 --> 00:11:08,010
Yes.

199
00:11:09,070 --> 00:11:09,990
Most likely.

200
00:11:10,290 --> 00:11:12,050
So, that's how it was...

201
00:11:13,670 --> 00:11:14,630
Of course,

202
00:11:14,810 --> 00:11:17,560
Shiori-san, you need to
recant your illicit activities.

203
00:11:18,560 --> 00:11:21,340
But, Takashi-san is
not at all repentant.

204
00:11:21,750 --> 00:11:23,700
Instead, he is trying to transfer

205
00:11:23,700 --> 00:11:26,590
the compensation fee that he
should be paying to Shiori-san.

206
00:11:27,100 --> 00:11:28,040
Unforgivable.

207
00:11:29,660 --> 00:11:32,190
And Karasuma cannot
be forgiven either...

208
00:11:32,780 --> 00:11:35,040
for having given such
instructions as a lawyer.

209
00:11:36,090 --> 00:11:37,500
What are you going to do?

210
00:11:40,150 --> 00:11:41,760
The most important thing is

211
00:11:41,760 --> 00:11:45,540
to get evidence that the Honjo
marriage was already finished.

212
00:11:46,210 --> 00:11:47,260
If we can get that,

213
00:11:47,260 --> 00:11:50,230
they cannot sue Shiori-san
for compensation.

214
00:11:50,660 --> 00:11:54,860
And in turn, it makes it possible
for us to sue them instead.

215
00:11:55,170 --> 00:11:57,480
It sounds like it's my turn now.

216
00:11:55,470 --> 00:11:57,840
Freelance Investigator
Umemoto Kurumi

217
00:11:57,830 --> 00:11:58,990
Kurumi-san.

218
00:11:59,530 --> 00:12:02,020
Looks like Sensei came
back to his senses.

219
00:12:02,440 --> 00:12:04,370
Which means he'd want me
to do some digging.

220
00:12:04,520 --> 00:12:05,680
Please do.

221
00:12:06,370 --> 00:12:07,690
I will personally pay for your services.

222
00:12:08,600 --> 00:12:09,640
Are you sure?

223
00:12:10,120 --> 00:12:10,760
Yes.

224
00:12:11,430 --> 00:12:14,890
And this time, I will lend
a hand in the investigation.

225
00:12:14,890 --> 00:12:16,160
You will, Sensei?

226
00:12:17,220 --> 00:12:21,160
If the current compensation lawsuit
is a planned conspiracy...

227
00:12:21,160 --> 00:12:22,890
it will be difficult to find evidence.

228
00:12:23,960 --> 00:12:26,550
Knowing how Karasuma works,

229
00:12:26,550 --> 00:12:29,790
there's a high probability that evidence
is being thoroughly covered up.

230
00:12:30,490 --> 00:12:31,830
We must go into this battle together.

231
00:12:33,460 --> 00:12:35,850
Don't cramp my style, though.

232
00:12:36,010 --> 00:12:37,980
Iron Spy Woman
Marilyn

233
00:12:36,010 --> 00:12:37,980
The Resurrection
of Marilyn

234
00:12:36,170 --> 00:12:37,820
Would you like to borrow this?

235
00:12:38,460 --> 00:12:39,620
No need.

236
00:12:39,970 --> 00:12:41,610
I have already studied it.

237
00:12:44,760 --> 00:12:48,720
Iron Spy Woman Marilyn,
season 29, episode 6.

238
00:12:49,040 --> 00:12:49,650
Huh?

239
00:12:50,090 --> 00:12:54,820
She who controls information
controls the world.

240
00:12:55,190 --> 00:12:58,440
She who controls information
controls the world.

241
00:12:59,060 --> 00:13:00,020
That's how it is.

242
00:13:01,600 --> 00:13:03,460
Why didn't you let me say it?!

243
00:13:06,100 --> 00:13:08,130
Sensei is fired up.

244
00:13:08,790 --> 00:13:10,120
Here you go.

245
00:13:10,980 --> 00:13:13,800
One fried chicken lunch,
and one seaweed lunch!

246
00:13:13,800 --> 00:13:14,290
Thanks.

247
00:13:14,290 --> 00:13:15,210
Sure.

248
00:13:15,210 --> 00:13:16,560
Oh, by the way...

249
00:13:16,780 --> 00:13:19,980
Are both of you employed
at Honjo Industries?

250
00:13:19,980 --> 00:13:21,080
You know where we work?

251
00:13:21,080 --> 00:13:22,280
Of course I do.

252
00:13:22,280 --> 00:13:24,580
It's rumored the men who
work there are gorgeous.

253
00:13:24,580 --> 00:13:25,620
Seriously?

254
00:13:25,620 --> 00:13:27,570
And that president Honjo.

255
00:13:27,570 --> 00:13:29,330
He's got that mature, awesome look.

256
00:13:29,330 --> 00:13:30,780
Might he be single?

257
00:13:30,780 --> 00:13:32,050
The president's married.

258
00:13:32,050 --> 00:13:34,040
He's a notorious womanizer, though.

259
00:13:34,040 --> 00:13:35,900
I wouldn't recommend him.

260
00:13:35,900 --> 00:13:37,370
Oh? Like how?

261
00:13:37,370 --> 00:13:38,040
For example—

262
00:13:37,650 --> 00:13:38,040
Hey.

263
00:13:38,850 --> 00:13:40,320
You're talking about
our president, here...

264
00:13:40,520 --> 00:13:41,620
Whoops, sorry.

265
00:13:41,620 --> 00:13:42,400
See you later.

266
00:13:42,580 --> 00:13:44,010
Hey! Wait a minute!

267
00:13:44,010 --> 00:13:45,410
I hear they're great!

268
00:13:45,680 --> 00:13:47,680
Excuse me, one fried chicken lunch, please!

269
00:13:47,280 --> 00:13:48,250
Yes, here you go!

270
00:13:51,370 --> 00:13:52,920
No, I don't have that.

271
00:13:52,920 --> 00:13:55,590
Honjo

272
00:13:53,370 --> 00:13:54,860
Did you hear?

273
00:13:54,860 --> 00:13:57,720
The Honjos are getting a divorce.

274
00:13:57,720 --> 00:13:58,720
I heard about that.

275
00:13:58,720 --> 00:14:00,450
I knew it was coming, though.

276
00:14:00,680 --> 00:14:04,150
What? They're getting a divorce?

277
00:14:04,910 --> 00:14:05,920
Who are you?

278
00:14:06,460 --> 00:14:09,820
We're newlyweds looking
for a place to live.

279
00:14:09,820 --> 00:14:12,980
Their home was up for sale,
so we went to check it out.

280
00:14:12,980 --> 00:14:14,440
Well, how about that.

281
00:14:14,720 --> 00:14:18,290
But they're moving out
because of a divorce.

282
00:14:18,290 --> 00:14:20,570
Sounds like bad luck,
doesn't it, honey?

283
00:14:21,100 --> 00:14:23,530
My wife is fussy
about things like that.

284
00:14:23,530 --> 00:14:26,430
Do you know the reason why
they're getting a divorce?

285
00:14:26,430 --> 00:14:29,500
I heard it's because the
husband cheated on her.

286
00:14:29,500 --> 00:14:31,450
What?! He was cheating?!

287
00:14:31,610 --> 00:14:33,620
Cheating? Recently?

288
00:14:34,450 --> 00:14:37,000
That man? He's been
playing around for ages.

289
00:14:37,000 --> 00:14:38,590
Shh, Yamamoto-san, we
can't talk about that...

290
00:14:39,110 --> 00:14:40,880
Oh, yeah. That's right.

291
00:14:41,360 --> 00:14:42,160
I'm sorry.

292
00:14:44,440 --> 00:14:46,370
They sure are thorough.

293
00:14:46,370 --> 00:14:48,910
They've even shut up
the local housewives.

294
00:14:49,450 --> 00:14:51,530
That's typical for Karasuma.

295
00:14:52,660 --> 00:14:54,650
Kanae-san, please have a
discussion with Kurumi-san

296
00:14:54,650 --> 00:14:56,800
and find another method
of investigating.

297
00:14:56,800 --> 00:14:58,020
And what will you do?

298
00:14:58,390 --> 00:15:01,470
I'm going to investigate
this area a bit more.

299
00:15:01,940 --> 00:15:03,380
I have a hunch.

300
00:15:03,770 --> 00:15:04,420
Understood.

301
00:15:05,050 --> 00:15:05,820
And...

302
00:15:06,100 --> 00:15:07,620
Is there a problem?

303
00:15:08,780 --> 00:15:10,620
You can let go now.

304
00:15:11,050 --> 00:15:12,620
Oh, that.

305
00:15:13,210 --> 00:15:14,770
Well, I'm going that way.

306
00:15:20,470 --> 00:15:21,560
What do you feel?

307
00:15:21,810 --> 00:15:25,970
Where can I go get evidence that
this couple's marriage was over?

308
00:15:25,970 --> 00:15:29,340
Cafe waitress
Mizutani Sara

309
00:15:30,330 --> 00:15:31,540
I'm sorry.

310
00:15:31,990 --> 00:15:33,990
I don't feel anything at all.

311
00:15:37,140 --> 00:15:40,720
I... don't like being pressured.

312
00:15:44,740 --> 00:15:45,450
I feel it.

313
00:15:46,000 --> 00:15:46,960
What is it?

314
00:15:47,160 --> 00:15:48,320
You are thinking,

315
00:15:49,020 --> 00:15:53,160
"This gal is useless."

316
00:15:54,600 --> 00:15:55,680
Bingo.

317
00:16:12,890 --> 00:16:14,360
You're being watched?

318
00:16:14,680 --> 00:16:15,530
Yes.

319
00:16:15,850 --> 00:16:19,170
There was a tall man wearing glasses
in front of our house.

320
00:16:19,170 --> 00:16:23,530
That probably was Hakamada,
our opposing attorney.

321
00:16:24,270 --> 00:16:25,440
Is everything all right?

322
00:16:26,120 --> 00:16:27,520
It's nothing to worry about.

323
00:16:28,120 --> 00:16:30,500
As long as you have me as your lawyer,

324
00:16:31,240 --> 00:16:35,050
the other party's lawyer is
strictly forbidden by law

325
00:16:35,050 --> 00:16:38,340
from contacting you
without my presence.

326
00:16:38,890 --> 00:16:40,130
If he broke that law,

327
00:16:40,130 --> 00:16:42,720
he will disbarred by
the bar association.

328
00:16:43,770 --> 00:16:46,520
You haven't done anything
conspicuous, have you?

329
00:16:47,240 --> 00:16:50,920
I haven't left the house other
than to go grocery shopping...

330
00:16:51,160 --> 00:16:53,350
I'm doing my usual household chores.

331
00:16:54,300 --> 00:16:54,920
Fine, then.

332
00:16:55,340 --> 00:16:56,360
Um...

333
00:16:57,220 --> 00:17:00,180
How much longer must
I continue like this?

334
00:17:00,180 --> 00:17:01,560
Just a little while longer.

335
00:17:01,560 --> 00:17:02,880
"A little longer" meaning when?

336
00:17:02,880 --> 00:17:04,100
Stop complaining.

337
00:17:04,440 --> 00:17:07,250
All you have to do is obey
our instructions. That's all.

338
00:17:09,240 --> 00:17:10,480
I understand.

339
00:17:15,080 --> 00:17:17,300
Don't worry about her.

340
00:17:18,300 --> 00:17:20,580
She can't go against my instructions.

341
00:17:21,520 --> 00:17:22,380
However,

342
00:17:22,380 --> 00:17:26,010
I heard someone was asking
my employees about me.

343
00:17:28,140 --> 00:17:31,340
It would affect their work performance
if rumors about me were to spread.

344
00:17:32,340 --> 00:17:33,900
Is there anything you
could do about that?

345
00:17:34,680 --> 00:17:36,750
There are ways...

346
00:17:37,960 --> 00:17:38,940
to shut them up.

347
00:17:46,040 --> 00:17:46,770
Sensei.

348
00:17:47,150 --> 00:17:50,150
Here's a tentative investigation
report from Kurumi-san.

349
00:17:51,540 --> 00:17:53,690
They're definitely being thorough.

350
00:17:54,070 --> 00:17:56,280
Supposedly, there are rumors

351
00:17:56,280 --> 00:17:57,530
that Takashi-san is a womanizer,

352
00:17:57,530 --> 00:18:00,740
and that he's cheated with women
other than Shiori-san...

353
00:18:00,740 --> 00:18:03,850
But there's no definitive evidence,
and no one will go into detail.

354
00:18:04,900 --> 00:18:05,890
Yes,

355
00:18:06,620 --> 00:18:08,280
they've being covering things up.

356
00:18:08,730 --> 00:18:09,820
We won't give up.

357
00:18:09,820 --> 00:18:11,730
Let's continue with our investigation.

358
00:18:14,420 --> 00:18:16,500
Sorry to barge in unannounced.

359
00:18:16,870 --> 00:18:17,950
Karasuma-san.

360
00:18:18,620 --> 00:18:19,580
Can we help you?

361
00:18:21,360 --> 00:18:23,780
Oh, don't make such a stern face.

362
00:18:24,240 --> 00:18:27,010
I've come here to give
you some news.

363
00:18:27,780 --> 00:18:30,880
Since we cannot get consent
for the compensation lawsuit,

364
00:18:31,200 --> 00:18:32,740
we are filing an action,

365
00:18:32,740 --> 00:18:34,580
and will take the matter to court.

366
00:18:34,800 --> 00:18:36,780
Taking it to court?

367
00:18:37,540 --> 00:18:42,740
Your client, Yoshihito-san,
has already filed a suit.

368
00:18:42,740 --> 00:18:45,870
Most likely, the two
hearings will converge.

369
00:18:45,870 --> 00:18:47,200
What do you mean, "converge"?

370
00:18:47,670 --> 00:19:00,810
Converged hearing

371
00:18:47,670 --> 00:19:00,810
Holding a hearing in a single trial concerning the demands of both the plaintiff and the defendant.

372
00:18:47,760 --> 00:18:51,840
It means holding one trial to judge
several conflicting demands.

373
00:18:52,130 --> 00:18:53,240
Simply put,

374
00:18:53,650 --> 00:18:56,990
it's a court battle of
our compensation lawsuit

375
00:18:57,260 --> 00:18:59,400
and their compensation lawsuit,
all at the same time.

376
00:18:59,680 --> 00:19:00,710
I see.

377
00:19:00,810 --> 00:19:01,920
Can you handle it?

378
00:19:02,690 --> 00:19:04,980
Since we're taking it to court,

379
00:19:04,980 --> 00:19:07,500
you won't have a leg to stand on

380
00:19:07,770 --> 00:19:09,290
if you have no evidence to present.

381
00:19:10,490 --> 00:19:12,060
You don't need to worry about that.

382
00:19:13,250 --> 00:19:14,620
Glad to hear it.

383
00:19:15,220 --> 00:19:16,790
We'll see you in court, then.

384
00:19:17,290 --> 00:19:20,460
Go easy on me, Hakamada-sensei.

385
00:19:26,580 --> 00:19:29,360
She's so arrogant...

386
00:19:29,980 --> 00:19:31,760
It seems she's quite confident.

387
00:19:31,760 --> 00:19:34,480
But you have a secret plan, right, Sensei?

388
00:19:35,280 --> 00:19:36,100
Secret plan?

389
00:19:36,100 --> 00:19:38,910
You said, "You don't need
to worry about that."

390
00:19:39,240 --> 00:19:40,180
Oh...

391
00:19:41,000 --> 00:19:43,330
I just said that because I was mad.

392
00:19:43,560 --> 00:19:44,310
What?

393
00:19:44,840 --> 00:19:46,200
So, you have nothing?

394
00:19:46,960 --> 00:19:47,920
Yes...

395
00:19:48,760 --> 00:19:50,090
For now, nothing.

396
00:19:57,400 --> 00:19:58,090
Yes.

397
00:19:58,500 --> 00:20:00,530
Hakamada-sensei, I found it.

398
00:20:00,910 --> 00:20:01,480
What?

399
00:20:02,600 --> 00:20:06,660
There's a bartender who says he saw
Takashi-san and Shiori-san on a date.

400
00:20:06,920 --> 00:20:08,420
Can you come here now?

401
00:20:08,900 --> 00:20:10,110
We'll be there right away.

402
00:20:11,400 --> 00:20:12,090
Yeah...

403
00:20:12,200 --> 00:20:14,250
No mistake, it was these two.

404
00:20:14,540 --> 00:20:16,940
I myself took an
interest in her at first,

405
00:20:16,940 --> 00:20:18,160
because she's my type.

406
00:20:18,610 --> 00:20:21,880
Then, this man showed up.

407
00:20:22,220 --> 00:20:23,500
I heard him say, "If you go out with me,

408
00:20:23,500 --> 00:20:26,060
I'll take you to Tahiti,
the Maldives, anywhere."

409
00:20:26,060 --> 00:20:27,260
He started coming onto her.

410
00:20:28,860 --> 00:20:30,060
Thanks.

411
00:20:30,390 --> 00:20:31,720
And how did the lady respond?

412
00:20:33,750 --> 00:20:35,770
She seemed happy about it, I think.

413
00:20:36,190 --> 00:20:40,640
But, she expressed worry that his wife
might find out if they went on a trip.

414
00:20:40,950 --> 00:20:43,070
And what did the man say about that?

415
00:20:45,760 --> 00:20:48,920
He said, "Even if she finds out,
there's no problem.

416
00:20:49,780 --> 00:20:52,340
"Our marriage is finished.

417
00:20:52,340 --> 00:20:54,520
It's only a matter of time
before we get divorced."

418
00:20:55,230 --> 00:20:56,410
That sounds like...

419
00:20:57,140 --> 00:20:58,600
Are you certain he said that?

420
00:20:58,770 --> 00:21:00,940
Yeah. There's no mistake.

421
00:21:01,560 --> 00:21:04,560
Would you be willing
to testify in court?

422
00:21:04,940 --> 00:21:05,710
Sure...

423
00:21:05,710 --> 00:21:07,670
I don't mind.

424
00:21:09,740 --> 00:21:11,210
I think we scored, Sensei.

425
00:21:11,410 --> 00:21:13,680
You can win at the hearing now, right?

426
00:21:14,340 --> 00:21:14,990
Yes...

427
00:21:18,350 --> 00:21:20,980
Court of Law

428
00:21:21,720 --> 00:21:24,800
What happens when hearings converge?

429
00:21:24,800 --> 00:21:25,890
This time around,

430
00:21:25,890 --> 00:21:30,720
the first case will concern the compensation lawsuit
of Yoshihito-san against Takashi-san.

431
00:21:30,720 --> 00:21:34,090
So, Yoshihito-san is the
plaintiff in the first case,

432
00:21:31,990 --> 00:21:38,600
Honjo Takashi (represented by  Karasuma) → first case defendant.

433
00:21:31,990 --> 00:21:38,600
Kurasawa Yoshihito (represented by Hakamada) → first case plaintiff

434
00:21:34,260 --> 00:21:37,060
and Takashi-san is the defendant.

435
00:21:37,060 --> 00:21:38,590
I see.

436
00:21:38,850 --> 00:21:42,630
So, Yayoi-san's lawsuit against
Shiori-san is the second case.

437
00:21:38,900 --> 00:21:46,170
Hojo Yayoi (represented by Karasuma) → second case plaintiff

438
00:21:38,900 --> 00:21:46,170
Kurasawa Shiori (represented by Hakamada)  → second case defendant.

439
00:21:42,630 --> 00:21:43,330
Yes.

440
00:21:43,330 --> 00:21:46,520
Both sides admit to illicit activities.

441
00:21:46,520 --> 00:21:48,840
So, in this case, the
crucial point of argument

442
00:21:48,840 --> 00:21:50,970
is whether the Honjos' marriage

443
00:21:49,780 --> 00:21:57,120
Main point of the hearing → Was the Honjos'
marriage already broken prior to the illicit affair?

444
00:21:50,970 --> 00:21:53,570
was already torn apart
before the illicit affair.

445
00:21:53,570 --> 00:21:56,540
Awesome, Kanae-san. You know your stuff.

446
00:21:56,540 --> 00:21:57,240
Yes.

447
00:21:57,240 --> 00:22:00,680
I did a lot of studying for this case.

448
00:22:07,520 --> 00:22:09,600
Regarding the couple
you saw at the bar...

449
00:22:10,220 --> 00:22:12,040
They were Shiori-san there,

450
00:22:12,040 --> 00:22:14,400
and Takashi-san there, is this correct?

451
00:22:14,620 --> 00:22:17,060
Yes, there's no mistake.

452
00:22:18,010 --> 00:22:22,010
Please share with the court what
you heard of their conversation.

453
00:22:24,110 --> 00:22:26,880
The man seemed a little tipsy.

454
00:22:26,880 --> 00:22:29,290
And he came on to the lady,
with offers to take her on trips.

455
00:22:30,290 --> 00:22:32,320
And how did Shiori-san respond?

456
00:22:33,680 --> 00:22:36,660
She said, "You have a wife,
won't you get in trouble?"

457
00:22:37,060 --> 00:22:38,900
And how did Takashi-san respond?

458
00:22:39,180 --> 00:22:40,980
He replied, "It doesn't
matter if she finds out.

459
00:22:40,980 --> 00:22:44,480
Our marriage is over."

460
00:22:44,760 --> 00:22:45,500
Anything else?

461
00:22:46,500 --> 00:22:48,710
He said, "It's only a matter
of time before we're divorced."

462
00:22:52,250 --> 00:22:54,020
From this testimony we can clearly see

463
00:22:54,790 --> 00:22:59,370
that Takashi-san and Yayoi-san's
marriage was already broken.

464
00:22:59,760 --> 00:23:03,880
And even if his words were
lies to seduce Shiori-san,

465
00:23:04,340 --> 00:23:06,800
Shiori-san, who believed his words,

466
00:23:07,060 --> 00:23:08,970
is not liable to pay for compensation.

467
00:23:09,920 --> 00:23:10,680
That is all.

468
00:23:12,660 --> 00:23:16,360
I have been to the bar
you work at, once.

469
00:23:17,320 --> 00:23:19,100
It is a very nice place, isn't it?

470
00:23:19,490 --> 00:23:21,130
Well, thank you.

471
00:23:21,800 --> 00:23:22,730
By the way,

472
00:23:23,390 --> 00:23:25,100
this is what it looks like inside.

473
00:23:25,680 --> 00:23:27,120
As you can see,

474
00:23:27,400 --> 00:23:31,210
they keep the lights extremely low,
in order to create ambience.

475
00:23:33,770 --> 00:23:36,070
It is difficult to see
who is in front of you.

476
00:23:37,300 --> 00:23:38,850
And yet, you claim

477
00:23:39,380 --> 00:23:42,280
that despite this and the fact that
you've never met these people,

478
00:23:43,840 --> 00:23:45,420
you still can identify their faces.

479
00:23:46,780 --> 00:23:49,480
Well, I...

480
00:23:49,480 --> 00:23:50,350
Objection.

481
00:23:51,040 --> 00:23:54,230
The defense's statement is mere speculation—

482
00:23:53,380 --> 00:23:54,230
No.

483
00:23:54,760 --> 00:23:59,960
I have definitive proof that the witness
was unable to hear any couple's conversation.

484
00:24:00,610 --> 00:24:05,020
What day and what month did Takashi-san
and Shiori-san meet at the bar?

485
00:24:06,950 --> 00:24:08,690
It was October 17th.

486
00:24:11,700 --> 00:24:16,410
I borrowed the shift schedule
from the bar's proprietor.

487
00:24:17,580 --> 00:24:19,460
On October 17th,

488
00:24:21,250 --> 00:24:25,620
Suho-san here was not at the bar.

489
00:24:21,620 --> 00:24:25,630
Friday    Day Off

490
00:24:21,620 --> 00:24:25,630
Latter half of October
Heisei 26

491
00:24:21,620 --> 00:24:25,630
Suho

492
00:24:26,380 --> 00:24:26,970
What?!

493
00:24:27,150 --> 00:24:28,200
You're lying.

494
00:24:28,460 --> 00:24:31,700
Couples with age differences
are not at all uncommon.

495
00:24:31,700 --> 00:24:35,730
This means you saw another
couple on another day,

496
00:24:36,210 --> 00:24:38,380
and got them mixed up.

497
00:24:41,690 --> 00:24:43,500
Well, now that you mention it...

498
00:24:43,500 --> 00:24:44,540
Hey, you.

499
00:24:44,540 --> 00:24:45,750
Have some resolve!

500
00:24:45,880 --> 00:24:46,760
Sensei.

501
00:24:47,290 --> 00:24:48,250
One moment, please.

502
00:24:48,780 --> 00:24:51,140
You saw photos of Takashi-san and Shiori-san

503
00:24:51,410 --> 00:24:53,760
and claimed there was no mistake
they were who you saw.

504
00:24:53,760 --> 00:24:58,420
But, like this lady says,
it's a dark bar, after all.

505
00:24:58,920 --> 00:24:59,860
What?

506
00:25:00,280 --> 00:25:01,430
Based on this testimony,

507
00:25:01,960 --> 00:25:05,960
there is no evidence that Takashi-san
and Yayoi-san's marriage was broken.

508
00:25:06,980 --> 00:25:07,940
That is all.

509
00:25:21,720 --> 00:25:23,650
Damn, she got us good.

510
00:25:23,650 --> 00:25:25,580
That witness was in cahoots with them.

511
00:25:25,780 --> 00:25:26,810
In cahoots?

512
00:25:27,140 --> 00:25:29,650
If we found strong evidence,

513
00:25:29,650 --> 00:25:31,560
we wouldn't need to
investigate any further.

514
00:25:31,560 --> 00:25:35,420
That's how they set it up, and used him
to play the unreliable witness.

515
00:25:36,330 --> 00:25:39,750
I can't believe I fell
into such an obvious trap.

516
00:25:55,960 --> 00:25:57,040
Hakamada-sensei.

517
00:25:57,490 --> 00:25:59,730
There's still time before
the next hearing.

518
00:25:59,730 --> 00:26:02,100
May I continue the investigation?

519
00:26:02,590 --> 00:26:04,610
Yes. Please do.

520
00:26:06,300 --> 00:26:07,620
Sensei, where are you going?

521
00:26:09,970 --> 00:26:11,560
I am going to investigate, as well.

522
00:26:12,020 --> 00:26:13,490
I leave the rest to you.

523
00:26:14,040 --> 00:26:15,130
Understood.

524
00:26:32,320 --> 00:26:33,380
Thank you very much.

525
00:26:33,380 --> 00:26:34,740
Thank you for the delivery.

526
00:26:35,700 --> 00:26:37,480
You are Honjo Yayoi-san?

527
00:26:38,090 --> 00:26:38,970
You...

528
00:26:39,450 --> 00:26:40,930
May I have a word with you?

529
00:26:42,200 --> 00:26:44,600
I have nothing to say.

530
00:26:45,560 --> 00:26:46,440
Please wait.

531
00:26:46,710 --> 00:26:49,220
Please contact Karasuma-san instead.

532
00:26:49,680 --> 00:26:52,700
Aren't you forbidden by law
from contacting me without permission?

533
00:26:53,770 --> 00:26:54,580
Yes,

534
00:26:55,470 --> 00:26:57,170
I'm prepared to be disbarred for this.

535
00:26:59,640 --> 00:27:03,340
Regardless, I must
know your side of this.

536
00:27:06,270 --> 00:27:07,740
Please, leave.

537
00:27:13,760 --> 00:27:16,430
Court of Law

538
00:27:21,620 --> 00:27:23,360
I feel pathetic...

539
00:27:23,850 --> 00:27:27,650
I couldn't find a single
piece of evidence.

540
00:27:28,280 --> 00:27:30,590
All we can do now is believe
in Hakamada-sensei.

541
00:27:30,810 --> 00:27:31,590
Huh?

542
00:27:32,200 --> 00:27:33,350
I know it'll turn out well.

543
00:27:34,140 --> 00:27:37,310
The bread he baked yesterday
was absolutely awful.

544
00:27:38,940 --> 00:27:43,080
What you see here are
photographs of the Honjo couple.

545
00:27:43,620 --> 00:27:49,630
They are even known by their neighbors
to be an intimately loving couple.

546
00:27:49,630 --> 00:27:52,030
You liar. Not a single
person said that.

547
00:27:52,590 --> 00:27:55,100
They would take trips
overseas every six months.

548
00:27:55,100 --> 00:27:57,220
They dined at restaurants
twice a month.

549
00:27:57,860 --> 00:28:02,700
They have many rules between them
to support their sense of marital bliss.

550
00:28:03,530 --> 00:28:06,270
Such a happy couple, and yet,

551
00:28:06,560 --> 00:28:09,240
because of one woman, they were
torn apart six months ago...

552
00:28:10,530 --> 00:28:14,010
That woman, Shiori-san, who sits there.

553
00:28:14,720 --> 00:28:15,780
Not true.

554
00:28:16,140 --> 00:28:18,400
Takashi-san was the one who initiated—

555
00:28:17,640 --> 00:28:20,330
There is no question, clearly,

556
00:28:20,330 --> 00:28:22,450
that Shiori-san aggressively seduced him.

557
00:28:23,380 --> 00:28:25,440
Looking at their texts.

558
00:28:25,850 --> 00:28:28,760
It is clear from these that
Shiori-san was the active initiator.

559
00:28:26,030 --> 00:28:30,100
Shiori

560
00:28:26,030 --> 00:28:30,100
Takashi-san r u free next week??


I want us to go to Yokohama next time <3 There's a super yummy pancake place there.


Take me out for lunch today

561
00:28:26,030 --> 00:28:30,100
Yes.


Understood.


Understood.

562
00:28:29,340 --> 00:28:30,670
But those texts...

563
00:28:30,670 --> 00:28:32,650
Yeah, that's not right!

564
00:28:32,650 --> 00:28:34,030
Please, you must calm yourself.

565
00:28:34,660 --> 00:28:38,220
This evidence tells the whole story.

566
00:28:39,060 --> 00:28:43,910
Shiori-san tore apart the
happy Honjo marriage...

567
00:28:44,250 --> 00:28:46,860
and stole the smile
off Yayoi-san's face.

568
00:28:47,380 --> 00:28:50,580
It is only natural that she
should pay for compensation.

569
00:28:50,800 --> 00:28:53,260
That woman really pisses me off.

570
00:28:53,260 --> 00:28:54,680
It's all outright lies.

571
00:28:54,930 --> 00:28:56,610
But, look...

572
00:28:59,840 --> 00:29:00,910
That is all.

573
00:29:07,580 --> 00:29:08,940
Hakamada-sensei.

574
00:29:09,330 --> 00:29:10,570
Can anything be done?

575
00:29:12,910 --> 00:29:13,700
Counselor.

576
00:29:16,160 --> 00:29:19,740
What you have presented is
completely erroneous.

577
00:29:22,920 --> 00:29:25,140
And on what do you base your assertion?

578
00:29:25,520 --> 00:29:29,390
This was not the first time Takashi-san
engaged in an illicit affair.

579
00:29:30,200 --> 00:29:33,660
He has had adulterous affairs
several times with other partners.

580
00:29:33,830 --> 00:29:36,020
Please present the
basis for your assertions.

581
00:29:36,020 --> 00:29:37,090
And every time he did,

582
00:29:37,480 --> 00:29:41,200
he deeply hurt his wife
Yayoi-san's feelings.

583
00:29:42,470 --> 00:29:45,350
Their marriage was already broken.

584
00:29:45,350 --> 00:29:46,300
Your Honor,

585
00:29:46,530 --> 00:29:48,900
the plaintiff is speaking
from sheer conjecture.

586
00:29:49,380 --> 00:29:52,540
Counselor, please clarify
the basis for your assertions.

587
00:29:54,530 --> 00:29:55,770
I have no basis.

588
00:29:56,200 --> 00:29:57,170
However,

589
00:29:57,170 --> 00:30:00,850
there is one witness who can expose
Takashi-san's past illicit activities.

590
00:30:02,020 --> 00:30:02,490
What?

591
00:30:02,490 --> 00:30:03,590
What witness?

592
00:30:07,530 --> 00:30:08,840
Honjo Takashi-san's wife,

593
00:30:10,830 --> 00:30:12,120
Honjo Yayoi-san.

594
00:30:15,540 --> 00:30:16,430
Yayoi-san?

595
00:30:16,560 --> 00:30:18,160
What's this guy babbling about?

596
00:30:18,570 --> 00:30:21,780
I request to question Yayoi-san.

597
00:30:21,990 --> 00:30:23,400
Question?

598
00:30:23,910 --> 00:30:26,940
He has requested to question
Yayoi-san directly.

599
00:30:27,210 --> 00:30:28,580
Counselor,

600
00:30:28,580 --> 00:30:29,780
what is your opinion?

601
00:30:29,780 --> 00:30:32,050
There is no need for that whatsoever.

602
00:30:32,240 --> 00:30:33,770
It is necessary,

603
00:30:33,770 --> 00:30:36,630
to prove that Yayoi-san's relationship to
her husband was already broken.

604
00:30:36,630 --> 00:30:41,140
Are you hoping Yayoi-san would state
something that would be disadvantageous to her?

605
00:30:41,140 --> 00:30:41,790
This is meaningless!

606
00:30:44,820 --> 00:30:46,050
Meaningless or not,

607
00:30:46,800 --> 00:30:48,490
it is Yayoi-san's decision to make.

608
00:30:49,790 --> 00:30:50,690
Yayoi-san,

609
00:30:51,160 --> 00:30:53,550
you do not have to agree to this.

610
00:30:53,550 --> 00:30:55,640
This is their ploy.

611
00:30:57,550 --> 00:30:59,660
I want to know your side.

612
00:31:00,460 --> 00:31:01,620
If you let this opportunity pass by,

613
00:31:02,120 --> 00:31:04,320
you will end up a mere bystander.

614
00:31:08,140 --> 00:31:10,180
Can you live with ending up
as a mere bystander?!

615
00:31:13,520 --> 00:31:16,840
This trial is important!

616
00:31:16,840 --> 00:31:18,380
It will determine your future.

617
00:31:20,030 --> 00:31:23,040
But, even from the very first conference,

618
00:31:23,510 --> 00:31:27,000
I felt nothing of your true will.

619
00:31:28,710 --> 00:31:30,540
If you win the trial,

620
00:31:31,000 --> 00:31:33,670
you will get compensation from
Takashi-san's partner in adultery.

621
00:31:35,020 --> 00:31:38,880
But is that going to heal your wounds?

622
00:31:40,800 --> 00:31:42,980
Who is it that you want to
really sue for compensation?

623
00:31:45,010 --> 00:31:49,310
Whose apology is it
that you really want?

624
00:31:55,280 --> 00:31:57,400
Yayoi, don't breathe a word.

625
00:31:58,070 --> 00:32:00,690
All you need to do is keep
quiet and do as I say.

626
00:32:00,690 --> 00:32:03,260
Do you have to do as he says?

627
00:32:03,760 --> 00:32:07,710
You are a victim of his
illicit activities.

628
00:32:17,980 --> 00:32:20,480
I will testify.

629
00:32:29,240 --> 00:32:31,300
It is as the lawyer said.

630
00:32:32,730 --> 00:32:37,240
Our married life was
already broken.

631
00:32:37,450 --> 00:32:38,240
Huh?

632
00:32:40,440 --> 00:32:41,670
Hey, stop talking!

633
00:32:41,830 --> 00:32:42,670
Yayoi-san.

634
00:32:42,670 --> 00:32:46,040
We were already making steady
arrangements for a divorce.

635
00:32:46,670 --> 00:32:50,740
This was not the first time
he had cheated on me.

636
00:32:50,740 --> 00:32:51,730
That's enough!

637
00:32:52,050 --> 00:32:53,600
Why won't you obey me?!

638
00:32:53,600 --> 00:32:57,300
Don't think for a minute that
I'll just do everything you say!

639
00:33:02,620 --> 00:33:05,720
This man has been seeing other women,

640
00:33:06,190 --> 00:33:08,740
even from the beginning of our marriage.

641
00:33:09,690 --> 00:33:12,100
And every time he was caught,
he would say,

642
00:33:12,400 --> 00:33:14,300
"I won't ever do it again,"

643
00:33:14,720 --> 00:33:16,510
and lie to appease me.

644
00:33:17,500 --> 00:33:18,690
And this pattern repeated

645
00:33:19,160 --> 00:33:21,560
over and over again.

646
00:33:23,100 --> 00:33:26,480
And all those times, not once,

647
00:33:27,020 --> 00:33:29,900
did he bow and apologize
for what he'd done.

648
00:33:31,820 --> 00:33:34,660
Why must I obey a man like that?

649
00:33:35,890 --> 00:33:40,020
Why must I pretend I had a happy marriage
with a man like that?!

650
00:33:51,530 --> 00:33:53,240
I am withdrawing my lawsuit.

651
00:33:54,620 --> 00:33:55,780
Yayoi-san.

652
00:33:56,000 --> 00:33:58,060
The one that I truly hate...

653
00:34:00,120 --> 00:34:01,490
is this man, here.

654
00:34:07,370 --> 00:34:09,620
Are you certain you with
to withdraw the lawsuit?

655
00:34:12,360 --> 00:34:12,980
Yes.

656
00:34:14,640 --> 00:34:17,470
Kurasawa Shiori-san, do you
agree to this withdrawal?

657
00:34:21,820 --> 00:34:22,480
Yes,

658
00:34:23,460 --> 00:34:24,270
we agree.

659
00:34:26,770 --> 00:34:33,490
This concludes Honjo Yayoi-san's compensation
lawsuit against Kurasawa Shiori-san.

660
00:34:34,390 --> 00:34:40,380
The court's decision of compensation
lawsuit case of Kurasawa Yoshihito-san

661
00:34:40,930 --> 00:34:45,680
versus Honjo Takashi-san will be
delivered April 10, 2015, at 1:15 pm.

662
00:34:49,860 --> 00:34:52,000
Do you know what
you've done to yourself?

663
00:34:53,040 --> 00:34:56,210
Now you won't get compensation,
and you did it to yourself.

664
00:34:59,340 --> 00:35:03,710
Your life after divorce
is going to be a tough one.

665
00:35:04,550 --> 00:35:07,250
No, that will not be the case.

666
00:35:09,860 --> 00:35:11,760
Yayoi-san can sue for compensation...

667
00:35:12,440 --> 00:35:15,210
from you, Takashi-san.

668
00:35:16,490 --> 00:35:17,690
Cut the crap.

669
00:35:18,070 --> 00:35:19,290
Why me?

670
00:35:20,200 --> 00:35:23,500
You have an obligation
to pay restitution

671
00:35:23,660 --> 00:35:26,830
for Yayoi-san's incurred psychological
trauma from your illicit activities.

672
00:35:27,330 --> 00:35:30,430
And there is compensation
with respect to the divorce.

673
00:35:30,550 --> 00:35:32,500
That's ridiculous. Are you joking?!

674
00:35:34,020 --> 00:35:35,460
I will fight it.

675
00:35:37,170 --> 00:35:39,080
I'm not paying you anything.

676
00:35:41,810 --> 00:35:43,580
You can fight all you want,

677
00:35:44,800 --> 00:35:46,530
but you don't stand a chance.

678
00:35:50,220 --> 00:35:51,350
Isn't that so,

679
00:35:52,300 --> 00:35:53,340
Karasuma-san?

680
00:35:54,540 --> 00:35:56,450
Something's wrong here.

681
00:35:57,890 --> 00:35:59,130
Hakamada-san.

682
00:35:59,820 --> 00:36:03,270
Did you see Yayoi-san
before the hearing,

683
00:36:04,160 --> 00:36:06,670
and plant ideas in her head?

684
00:36:07,540 --> 00:36:08,540
Because if you did,

685
00:36:09,020 --> 00:36:11,140
the bar association will disbar you.

686
00:36:14,460 --> 00:36:16,120
No such thing happened.

687
00:36:16,990 --> 00:36:18,880
I did this out of my own volition.

688
00:36:19,200 --> 00:36:20,300
That's not possible.

689
00:36:20,860 --> 00:36:22,590
You're not capable of
standing up for yourself—

690
00:36:22,590 --> 00:36:26,370
If you must insist, then show me proof.

691
00:36:27,720 --> 00:36:29,360
Proof is your specialty, isn't it?

692
00:36:35,410 --> 00:36:36,490
Karasuma-san.

693
00:36:38,070 --> 00:36:40,020
I am no longer your client.

694
00:36:40,780 --> 00:36:45,730
Not once did you lend an ear
to what I had to say.

695
00:36:46,820 --> 00:36:50,810
I cannot entrust my future
to such a person.

696
00:36:52,340 --> 00:36:53,470
Goodbye.

697
00:37:06,830 --> 00:37:08,660
All you thought about was winning,

698
00:37:09,850 --> 00:37:11,660
and you neglected the
most important thing,

699
00:37:12,120 --> 00:37:14,200
the will of your client.

700
00:37:15,560 --> 00:37:17,180
And this is the result.

701
00:37:21,290 --> 00:37:24,190
Well then, goodbye.

702
00:37:25,320 --> 00:37:27,480
You must be quite
satisfied with yourself.

703
00:37:28,280 --> 00:37:30,100
A splendid victory in court,

704
00:37:30,830 --> 00:37:33,580
and you avenged the grudge
you held for ten years.

705
00:37:35,300 --> 00:37:36,900
Please don't belittle me.

706
00:37:37,860 --> 00:37:42,030
I did not fight in this hearing
for something like that.

707
00:37:44,550 --> 00:37:45,860
Then, and even now,

708
00:37:47,580 --> 00:37:51,640
there is only one thing
I want you to do.

709
00:37:55,170 --> 00:37:56,320
Goodbye.

710
00:37:57,640 --> 00:38:00,340
You couldn't tell from
the hearing today?

711
00:38:03,820 --> 00:38:09,660
There's only one thing you can do
to someone you've hurt, isn't there?

712
00:38:20,420 --> 00:38:21,780
To celebrate our victory,

713
00:38:21,780 --> 00:38:23,400
I will whip up champagne bread.

714
00:38:23,400 --> 00:38:24,650
Champagne bread?

715
00:38:24,650 --> 00:38:27,050
I'll knead champagne into the dough.

716
00:38:27,050 --> 00:38:28,860
It'd be better to have them separately.

717
00:38:28,860 --> 00:38:30,660
You'll ruin two ingredients at once.

718
00:38:44,770 --> 00:38:47,490
In that case, how about
sweet bean bread?

719
00:38:48,010 --> 00:38:50,890
I'll knead sweet bean into the dough.

720
00:38:50,890 --> 00:38:53,000
The sweet beans are supposed
to be in the middle!

721
00:38:54,200 --> 00:38:56,340
Hakamada
Law Office

722
00:38:55,770 --> 00:38:57,600
Because she has withdrawn the suit,

723
00:38:57,600 --> 00:39:00,800
you no longer have to pay
compensation, Shiori-san.

724
00:39:02,370 --> 00:39:06,450
The property seizures and wage
garnishments have also been withdrawn.

725
00:39:08,710 --> 00:39:12,920
I am positive the court will approve
Yoshihito-san's lawsuit against Takashi-san.

726
00:39:13,440 --> 00:39:16,490
This time, it will be
approximately one to two million.

727
00:39:17,150 --> 00:39:18,140
On top of that,

728
00:39:18,530 --> 00:39:21,990
since they unjustly threatened
with seizure and lawsuit,

729
00:39:22,340 --> 00:39:26,480
Shiori-san can demand compensation
for attorney fees, and so on.

730
00:39:27,010 --> 00:39:28,760
She can make all those demands?

731
00:39:28,970 --> 00:39:31,730
I expect your wedding
will be a great one.

732
00:39:32,300 --> 00:39:33,530
Hakamada-sensei.

733
00:39:33,960 --> 00:39:36,540
Thank you for everything
you've done for us.

734
00:39:37,360 --> 00:39:38,850
Thank you very much.

735
00:39:40,060 --> 00:39:46,010
I pray that you two will never
have to come here again.

736
00:39:47,300 --> 00:39:48,280
Yes.

737
00:39:50,490 --> 00:39:54,300
Are you sure you want to decline
the weekly serial offer?

738
00:39:54,300 --> 00:39:55,100
Yes.

739
00:39:55,100 --> 00:39:56,460
I've already decided.

740
00:39:56,460 --> 00:39:59,190
Big chances like that are
very rare, you know.

741
00:39:59,920 --> 00:40:02,840
My prediction came
true, as I knew it would.

742
00:40:03,110 --> 00:40:04,760
What prediction?

743
00:40:05,090 --> 00:40:05,810
What?

744
00:40:06,200 --> 00:40:07,970
You don't remember?

745
00:40:09,470 --> 00:40:10,890
I feel it.

746
00:40:11,680 --> 00:40:13,400
You will lose something big, very soon.

747
00:40:14,470 --> 00:40:15,130
What?

748
00:40:15,400 --> 00:40:17,690
You were talking about me?

749
00:40:18,520 --> 00:40:19,210
Yes.

750
00:40:20,340 --> 00:40:23,220
But, I don't feel like I've lost anything.

751
00:40:23,570 --> 00:40:27,220
I am going to continue working
at the Hakamada Law Office,

752
00:40:27,220 --> 00:40:28,940
and continue the monthly serial.

753
00:40:29,190 --> 00:40:32,210
That is what I want to do now.

754
00:40:33,220 --> 00:40:36,120
As your editor,

755
00:40:36,120 --> 00:40:39,270
I promise you I'll make
your work a big hit!

756
00:40:39,920 --> 00:40:42,040
Thank you for always supporting me.
I look forward to working with you.

757
00:40:42,040 --> 00:40:42,760
Yes.

758
00:40:43,960 --> 00:40:45,080
Oh, and...

759
00:40:45,590 --> 00:40:48,000
I've always been thinking this, but...

760
00:40:48,620 --> 00:40:52,580
You don't have any
mysterious powers, right?

761
00:40:54,550 --> 00:40:56,670
Why would you say that?

762
00:40:56,670 --> 00:40:58,970
May I have a look at this?

763
00:40:59,680 --> 00:41:01,050
Please don't touch it!

764
00:41:01,050 --> 00:41:03,650
It cost me 3,000 yen online!

765
00:41:03,650 --> 00:41:04,390
Cheap!

766
00:41:04,390 --> 00:41:06,680
This thing is totally suspicious.

767
00:41:06,680 --> 00:41:07,950
It's not cheap.

768
00:41:10,870 --> 00:41:13,490
Kanae-san, you turned down
the weekly serialization?

769
00:41:13,490 --> 00:41:14,660
She did.

770
00:41:14,660 --> 00:41:16,120
What a waste.

771
00:41:16,120 --> 00:41:20,020
But finally, the manga is
coming out in a single volume!

772
00:41:20,090 --> 00:41:21,720
Wow, amazing!

773
00:41:21,720 --> 00:41:23,500
Living on royalties, what a dream.

774
00:41:23,500 --> 00:41:25,530
What percentage do manga
illustrators get?

775
00:41:25,530 --> 00:41:28,380
Please don't jump right to money talk.

776
00:41:28,380 --> 00:41:30,500
But, I'm on a roll.

777
00:41:30,500 --> 00:41:35,280
The protagonist's reason for becoming
a divorce lawyer is revealed!

778
00:41:35,550 --> 00:41:39,350
The story is going to keep
getting better and better.

779
00:41:40,000 --> 00:41:42,080
And why did he become a divorce lawyer?

780
00:41:42,730 --> 00:41:44,340
Because of a past
relationship with a woman.

781
00:41:44,580 --> 00:41:48,100
Because the protagonist is
modeled after Hakamada-sensei.

782
00:41:48,600 --> 00:41:49,210
Huh?

783
00:41:50,370 --> 00:41:51,810
But, that wasn't my reason why.

784
00:41:51,950 --> 00:41:52,590
What?

785
00:41:52,880 --> 00:41:53,880
It's not?

786
00:41:53,880 --> 00:41:55,060
What? It's not?

787
00:41:55,060 --> 00:41:55,780
It's not?

788
00:41:55,780 --> 00:41:56,940
Then, why?

789
00:41:58,800 --> 00:42:02,140
The reason why I became
a divorce lawyer...

790
00:42:06,450 --> 00:42:09,490
This drama is a work of fiction.

791
00:42:06,580 --> 00:42:08,500
What?!
