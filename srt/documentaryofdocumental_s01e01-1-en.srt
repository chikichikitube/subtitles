00:00:13,330 --> 00:00:22,670
[Subbed by Thanos-no-Tsukai
Thanks For Watching!]

2
00:00:31,780 --> 00:00:33,050
Hot!

3
00:00:33,250 --> 00:00:33,550
Damn it!

4
00:00:33,910 --> 00:00:34,280
That was hot!

5
00:00:36,420 --> 00:00:36,750
My god!

6
00:00:37,920 --> 00:00:38,820
It hurts so much!

7
00:00:38,820 --> 00:00:40,150
Shake! Shake! Shake! Shake!

8
00:00:43,020 --> 00:00:43,920
Ouch!

9
00:00:52,000 --> 00:00:52,760
Let's go!

10
00:00:54,600 --> 00:00:55,300
You bastard!

11
00:00:58,170 --> 00:00:58,770
Let go.

12
00:01:07,280 --> 00:01:07,910
Thank you for being here today.

13
00:01:07,910 --> 00:01:08,250
Thank you for having me.
Thank you for being here today.

14
00:01:08,250 --> 00:01:09,080
Thank you for having me.

15
00:01:09,380 --> 00:01:13,920
The beginning of this season was like the debut of a porn actress, wasn't it?

16
00:01:14,320 --> 00:01:16,090
Like, "Did you have a good sleep after?".

17
00:01:20,760 --> 00:01:21,190
Isn't that amazing?

18
00:01:21,190 --> 00:01:26,100
If you think about it, porn actresses would have sex after those scenes.

19
00:01:26,930 --> 00:01:30,070
I realized how hard they must work.

20
00:01:31,600 --> 00:01:32,840
And today we're talking about that, right?

21
00:01:32,840 --> 00:01:34,310
-I mean, we're not talking about porn...
-Right.

22
00:01:40,550 --> 00:01:43,280
We've been building up our audience during these past three seasons.

23
00:01:43,280 --> 00:01:45,280
And the response has been huge this time around.

24
00:01:45,280 --> 00:01:45,750
That's right.
And the response has been huge this time around.

25
00:01:45,750 --> 00:01:46,380
That's right.

26
00:01:46,720 --> 00:01:50,820
Did you ever anticipate this reaction from the public?

27
00:01:51,760 --> 00:02:00,070
Well, whenever I start something new I'm not really as conscious of it as people may think.

28
00:02:00,400 --> 00:02:03,700
I never thought I was doing anything that incredible.

29
00:02:03,700 --> 00:02:08,170
I only thought of getting some laughs.

30
00:02:08,710 --> 00:02:12,540
So I was never worried about the show at all.

31
00:02:12,780 --> 00:02:16,210
Since it's a new show, you could do some new and bold things, right?

32
00:02:16,280 --> 00:02:18,520
Well... But you know, I...

33
00:02:18,720 --> 00:02:20,350
I don't really know about that.

34
00:02:20,350 --> 00:02:23,720
But whenever we do comedy in places like this (Streaming Services),

35
00:02:24,060 --> 00:02:29,690
we end up thinking of stuff we're not allowed to do on TV.

36
00:02:29,790 --> 00:02:32,400
But you end up being too conscious of TV.

37
00:02:32,630 --> 00:02:35,330
And you also get fettered by it.

38
00:02:35,670 --> 00:02:39,000
Instead, we should just focus on making a funny product.

39
00:02:39,000 --> 00:02:43,040
And even on TV, all we need is good comedy.

40
00:02:43,780 --> 00:02:46,310
Documental, start!

41
00:02:48,310 --> 00:02:48,850
It started.

42
00:02:48,950 --> 00:02:50,120
Oh, it's finally started.

43
00:02:50,120 --> 00:02:50,380
Let's play nice.
Oh, it's finally started.

44
00:02:50,380 --> 00:02:50,820
Let's play nice.

45
00:02:50,820 --> 00:02:55,050
But I feel like the world has changed their opinion on shows in streaming services.

46
00:02:55,050 --> 00:02:55,890
Right...
But I feel like the world has changed their opinion on shows in streaming services.

47
00:02:55,890 --> 00:02:55,950
But I feel like the world has changed their opinion on shows in streaming services.

48
00:02:55,990 --> 00:03:03,700
I didn't really know how Amazon Prime Video would turn out either.

49
00:03:03,830 --> 00:03:05,130
But it has clearly changed, hasn't it?

50
00:03:05,600 --> 00:03:06,600
The atmosphere, I mean.

51
00:03:06,800 --> 00:03:07,200
Yeah.

52
00:03:07,530 --> 00:03:08,270
I think it has.

53
00:03:08,270 --> 00:03:09,170
Right...

54
00:03:09,470 --> 00:03:15,410
Season 1
Began Streaming on November 2016

55
00:03:15,470 --> 00:03:18,640
What is the hardest thing about doing Documental?

56
00:03:18,840 --> 00:03:22,950
The hardest thing is going on the offense.

57
00:03:23,220 --> 00:03:25,120
Ready, go!

58
00:03:28,890 --> 00:03:30,460
Maybe it's just the nature of our work...

59
00:03:30,790 --> 00:03:34,490
But whenever you try something new, you always get questions.

60
00:03:38,030 --> 00:03:40,400
And at times you can't help but to laugh at that.

61
00:03:40,930 --> 00:03:43,600
Nice to meet you, I'm Yuriko Koike. (EN: 1)

62
00:03:44,170 --> 00:03:44,600
Nice to meet you.

63
00:03:45,140 --> 00:03:46,400
You're going to Toyosu, right? (EN: 2)

64
00:03:46,500 --> 00:03:47,340
No, I changed my mind.

65
00:03:47,570 --> 00:03:47,970
What?!

66
00:03:48,370 --> 00:03:48,870
Really?

67
00:03:48,940 --> 00:03:49,240
Yes.

68
00:03:49,240 --> 00:03:49,810
Where, then?

69
00:03:50,010 --> 00:03:50,810
Jakuzure. (EN: 3)

70
00:03:51,610 --> 00:03:52,110
What's wrong?

71
00:03:56,110 --> 00:03:58,280
You're better off going on the offensive.

72
00:04:00,120 --> 00:04:01,720
But it's also much more risky.

73
00:04:21,240 --> 00:04:22,510
This is so embarrassing.

74
00:04:28,410 --> 00:04:30,220
You're already laughing!

75
00:04:30,380 --> 00:04:33,050
Is this really a documentary, or is it a TV show?

76
00:04:33,520 --> 00:04:34,620
Could you talk about that?

77
00:04:34,920 --> 00:04:37,290
Well...

78
00:04:37,390 --> 00:04:41,130
I do read the reviews, you know?

79
00:04:41,460 --> 00:04:45,700
But there's some people that take it way too seriously.

80
00:04:46,560 --> 00:04:47,170
Ehm...

81
00:04:48,000 --> 00:04:51,440
And I always think to myself, "You guys are taking this too far"

82
00:04:51,840 --> 00:04:53,940
But in a sense it's also a TV show.

83
00:04:54,140 --> 00:04:55,770
It's entertainment.

84
00:04:58,580 --> 00:05:00,050
What's wrong with Kinoshita?

85
00:05:01,980 --> 00:05:03,350
Yamamoto is laughing.

86
00:05:04,680 --> 00:05:05,750
He's still fine.

87
00:05:05,750 --> 00:05:06,320
He won't laugh.

88
00:05:06,580 --> 00:05:09,750
But all these comedians are really smart.

89
00:05:10,320 --> 00:05:12,890
They are all working hard and going all in.

90
00:05:12,890 --> 00:05:16,630
But you have to look at that place objectively.

91
00:05:16,630 --> 00:05:23,340
The rules of the game will keep changing.

92
00:05:24,870 --> 00:05:27,110
Who did you think was the worst of all the members?

93
00:05:27,610 --> 00:05:30,910
I guess that would be Jimmy.

94
00:05:30,980 --> 00:05:31,910
It's gotta be Jimmy.

95
00:05:31,910 --> 00:05:33,310
I actually hadn't met him.

96
00:05:33,450 --> 00:05:35,050
It's Jimmy.

97
00:05:35,410 --> 00:05:37,420
I haven't properly introduced myself to Jimmy yet.

98
00:05:37,420 --> 00:05:38,080
Oh...

99
00:05:38,080 --> 00:05:38,320
Really?

100
00:05:38,880 --> 00:05:40,750
I'm Tokyo Dynamite's Jiro Hachimitsu.

101
00:05:41,120 --> 00:05:43,320
-I'm always watching you on TV.
-Thank you.

102
00:05:44,690 --> 00:05:45,360
Have you met him?

103
00:05:45,960 --> 00:05:47,660
It's also my first time meeting him.

104
00:05:47,990 --> 00:05:49,530
Nice to meet you.

105
00:05:49,830 --> 00:05:50,960
I'm Kyojin, from "All Hanshin Kyojin".

106
00:05:52,060 --> 00:05:52,700
Nice to meet you.

107
00:05:52,700 --> 00:05:53,100
That ain't right.

108
00:05:53,200 --> 00:05:53,700
That's not right.

109
00:05:53,700 --> 00:05:54,030
What is?

110
00:05:55,200 --> 00:05:55,730
Come on.

111
00:05:56,470 --> 00:05:57,340
Huh? Which is it?

112
00:05:57,340 --> 00:05:58,370
I-I'm Kyojin.

113
00:05:59,500 --> 00:06:00,110
Jimmy...

114
00:06:00,970 --> 00:06:01,610
Are you Kyojin?

115
00:06:02,010 --> 00:06:02,340
Yes.

116
00:06:02,470 --> 00:06:03,210
You're not Hanshin?

117
00:06:03,210 --> 00:06:04,010
It's super small.

118
00:06:04,510 --> 00:06:05,910
Jimmy is about to go.

119
00:06:06,080 --> 00:06:06,880
But you said "Kyojin".

120
00:06:07,780 --> 00:06:08,450
Ehm... Jimmy?

121
00:06:09,310 --> 00:06:10,010
Jimmy?

122
00:06:10,010 --> 00:06:11,580
Excuse me, I'm gonna get up.

123
00:06:11,580 --> 00:06:12,050
Sorry.

124
00:06:12,550 --> 00:06:13,990
H-Hold on!

125
00:06:14,420 --> 00:06:15,420
Hold it!

126
00:06:15,420 --> 00:06:16,920
Wait! Wait! Wait!

127
00:06:17,020 --> 00:06:18,260
No way!

128
00:06:18,420 --> 00:06:20,090
Jimmy is a bit twisted, isn't he?

129
00:06:20,160 --> 00:06:21,660
Jimmy, huh?

130
00:06:21,660 --> 00:06:24,860
That guy might be a different species.

131
00:06:24,930 --> 00:06:26,330
According to Jimmy...

132
00:06:26,400 --> 00:06:30,370
He thinks he's like an air purifier, cleansing all the bad air out.

133
00:06:30,370 --> 00:06:31,970
That's how he keeps the comedy in the room alive.

134
00:06:32,240 --> 00:06:34,410
And the moment he's gone...

135
00:06:34,410 --> 00:06:37,780
-Everyone's dazed and a bit confused.
-I see.

136
00:06:38,040 --> 00:06:40,750
What is that power?

137
00:06:41,480 --> 00:06:43,520
Instead of forcing a laugh,

138
00:06:43,680 --> 00:06:49,590
I think it's important to first create an atmosphere where the comedians have no choice but to laugh.

139
00:06:51,090 --> 00:06:55,430
And to make that happen, you have to do some crazy stuff.

140
00:06:56,800 --> 00:06:58,500
That's how I think about it.

141
00:06:59,300 --> 00:07:00,770
Everyone, pay attention.

142
00:07:00,770 --> 00:07:01,200
Everyone.

143
00:07:01,300 --> 00:07:02,170
Did you quit priesthood?

144
00:07:02,170 --> 00:07:02,730
I'm quitting.

145
00:07:03,540 --> 00:07:03,770
Hmm?

146
00:07:04,070 --> 00:07:04,600
Everyone, look.

147
00:07:04,840 --> 00:07:05,070
Yes.

148
00:07:05,270 --> 00:07:05,740
Alright.

149
00:07:05,740 --> 00:07:06,570
Stop being a priest.

150
00:07:08,410 --> 00:07:09,410
You're already laughing.

151
00:07:09,670 --> 00:07:10,280
I'm not.

152
00:07:10,610 --> 00:07:11,180
Look, look.

153
00:07:17,920 --> 00:07:18,320
Wha-?!

154
00:07:18,820 --> 00:07:19,850
What is this?

155
00:07:19,850 --> 00:07:21,150
What the heck?

156
00:07:21,190 --> 00:07:22,290
I can't deal with this.

157
00:07:23,820 --> 00:07:27,860
I didn't use any of my old jokes for this show.

158
00:07:28,090 --> 00:07:31,030
I had to come up with all new stuff.

159
00:07:33,600 --> 00:07:36,100
Even now, I still laugh at the thought of this...

160
00:07:36,770 --> 00:07:42,070
When Jimmy's balls were getting sucked into the vacuum cleaner.

161
00:07:44,810 --> 00:07:45,040
Let's go.

162
00:07:49,510 --> 00:07:50,250
Ow! Ow! Ow!

163
00:07:53,920 --> 00:07:55,520
That was hilarious.

164
00:07:55,750 --> 00:07:59,360
I've never seen anything like that before.

165
00:08:01,090 --> 00:08:03,730
You know, that guy is almost the same age as me.

166
00:08:04,000 --> 00:08:06,800
Actually, he's way older.

167
00:08:07,330 --> 00:08:09,200
But he's always been like that.

168
00:08:09,930 --> 00:08:11,270
He's so funny.

169
00:08:11,440 --> 00:08:16,710
But he's lost all respect from the younger generation.

170
00:08:17,480 --> 00:08:21,610
He's not holding anything back, that's why he's so funny.

171
00:08:24,580 --> 00:08:25,880
Hot!

172
00:08:27,850 --> 00:08:29,290
That's so hot!

173
00:08:29,390 --> 00:08:30,120
Hot!

174
00:08:30,760 --> 00:08:32,260
That was super hot!

175
00:08:33,530 --> 00:08:38,760
Whenever we ask who is the worst to have, Jimmy's name always comes up.

176
00:08:38,760 --> 00:08:41,400
But when they think about it carefully, it's always Cookie.

177
00:08:41,870 --> 00:08:43,030
I see.

178
00:08:43,230 --> 00:08:46,640
Personally, I think Kukky is really crazy.

179
00:08:48,540 --> 00:08:49,310
For me it's Kawashima. (Kunihiro Kawashima, aka Cookie)

180
00:08:49,470 --> 00:08:50,880
Cookie is also crazy.

181
00:08:50,880 --> 00:08:51,510
So funny.

182
00:08:51,980 --> 00:08:53,950
You never know what he's gonna do.

183
00:08:59,050 --> 00:08:59,680
Alright, Daisuke!

184
00:09:01,220 --> 00:09:01,690
Kubota.

185
00:09:08,560 --> 00:09:10,430
It's a real photo of a ghost, take a good look.

186
00:09:10,430 --> 00:09:11,300
Really?

187
00:09:11,300 --> 00:09:12,060
A ghost?

188
00:09:12,530 --> 00:09:13,330
That's just a tiny head.

189
00:09:14,270 --> 00:09:14,770
That's scary.

190
00:09:14,770 --> 00:09:15,570
It's super small.

191
00:09:15,730 --> 00:09:16,800
It's the tiny head Master.

192
00:09:16,970 --> 00:09:17,740
Isn't he just far away?

193
00:09:17,940 --> 00:09:19,400
No, no, he's in front.

194
00:09:19,400 --> 00:09:21,140
If it was far away, his body would also be small.

195
00:09:21,370 --> 00:09:22,010
Forced perspective.

196
00:09:22,410 --> 00:09:23,910
Only the head is far away.

197
00:09:24,010 --> 00:09:24,810
Master Daisuke is scary.

198
00:09:25,710 --> 00:09:26,840
Is this forced perspective?

199
00:09:27,450 --> 00:09:32,720
Cookie is really... You know...

200
00:09:33,020 --> 00:09:37,260
I'm always amazed by his existence.

201
00:09:39,090 --> 00:09:39,420
Here.

202
00:09:39,920 --> 00:09:40,860
Hold on, stop, stop.

203
00:09:40,860 --> 00:09:41,590
They put in white ones now.

204
00:09:41,590 --> 00:09:41,730
Look here, look.
They put in white ones now.

205
00:09:41,730 --> 00:09:42,630
Look here, look.

206
00:09:42,790 --> 00:09:43,730
It's full of silver-capped teeth.

207
00:09:45,800 --> 00:09:46,400
What's going on?

208
00:09:50,940 --> 00:09:52,400
Look at them, look.

209
00:09:54,340 --> 00:09:56,310
He's got a bit of a different approach than the other comedians.

210
00:09:56,310 --> 00:09:56,840
He does.
He's got a bit of a different approach than the other comedians.

211
00:09:56,840 --> 00:09:57,410
He does.

212
00:09:57,680 --> 00:09:59,510
It's a very strange way to approach it though.

213
00:09:59,610 --> 00:10:02,550
Well, he's also doing other stuff with Amazon.

214
00:10:03,180 --> 00:10:04,950
I also watch it all.

215
00:10:04,950 --> 00:10:06,650
But he sure is funny.

216
00:10:06,650 --> 00:10:07,790
What's wrong with him?

217
00:10:08,250 --> 00:10:11,420
But many people think he's nonsensical, but that's not the case at all.

218
00:10:11,960 --> 00:10:15,090
He's just very good at acting like that.

219
00:10:15,090 --> 00:10:15,960
He's amazing.

220
00:10:16,390 --> 00:10:19,200
But you have to be amazing to be here.

221
00:10:19,730 --> 00:10:25,640
You can really feel the comedic talent in the room.

222
00:10:25,900 --> 00:10:32,980
All the guys that were told "you're hilarious, you're funny" in middle and high school are all here.

223
00:10:33,080 --> 00:10:35,880
That's why I love this kind of environment.

224
00:10:36,010 --> 00:10:37,620
I want everyone to know me better.

225
00:10:38,220 --> 00:10:40,920
So I brought some old photos of me.

226
00:10:41,290 --> 00:10:42,420
When were these taken?

227
00:10:42,620 --> 00:10:44,960
Like, in primary and middle school.

228
00:10:45,690 --> 00:10:47,290
This is my primary school entrance ceremony.

229
00:10:47,760 --> 00:10:48,690
Oh, these are your memories?

230
00:10:48,860 --> 00:10:49,060
Yes.

231
00:10:49,330 --> 00:10:50,530
I wanted to show everyone...

232
00:10:51,100 --> 00:10:52,500
My primary school graduation ceremony.

233
00:10:52,730 --> 00:10:53,360
Oh my.

234
00:10:56,730 --> 00:10:59,540
This is my American father.

235
00:11:02,870 --> 00:11:03,910
Fujimon, please take a look.

236
00:11:04,080 --> 00:11:04,710
Victor.

237
00:11:05,310 --> 00:11:06,080
Professor Victor?

238
00:11:07,610 --> 00:11:08,350
His name is Victor.

239
00:11:08,810 --> 00:11:10,180
Please look at Victor's photo.

240
00:11:12,280 --> 00:11:15,450
That's where the direction of the comedy falls to pieces.

241
00:11:15,450 --> 00:11:15,920
That's right.
That's where the direction of the comedy falls to pieces.

242
00:11:15,920 --> 00:11:16,390
That's right.

243
00:11:16,550 --> 00:11:17,560
-It's those moments.
-Right, right.

244
00:11:17,890 --> 00:11:20,220
Those moments when they're not sure of what's funny anymore.

245
00:11:20,220 --> 00:11:20,630
Cause they have no input.
Those moments when they're not sure of what's funny anymore.

246
00:11:20,630 --> 00:11:21,430
Cause they have no input.

247
00:11:21,430 --> 00:11:21,660
That's right.
Cause they have no input.

248
00:11:21,660 --> 00:11:22,630
That's right.

249
00:11:23,190 --> 00:11:24,700
You really don't know.

250
00:11:25,430 --> 00:11:26,730
For real.

251
00:11:27,330 --> 00:11:29,200
You prepare some jokes...

252
00:11:30,700 --> 00:11:36,970
But then you figure, "This'll fall flat if I do it now".

253
00:11:37,080 --> 00:11:38,410
And that's constantly in your mind.

254
00:11:38,910 --> 00:11:40,710
And I think this happens to everyone.

255
00:11:41,280 --> 00:11:41,850
Like...

256
00:11:42,350 --> 00:11:45,320
"Oh no... This is bad, it's bad... Hold on..."

257
00:11:45,820 --> 00:11:47,120
"I'm bombing!"

258
00:11:47,250 --> 00:11:50,090
"If I say it now, I'll totally bomb!"

259
00:11:50,960 --> 00:11:51,460
Yeah.

260
00:11:52,190 --> 00:11:56,430
But you know, most of it will flop.

261
00:11:56,630 --> 00:11:57,500
Doesn't matter what you do.

262
00:11:58,430 --> 00:12:03,800
And coming up with new stuff after everything else is gone, is what's interesting.

263
00:12:04,040 --> 00:12:06,700
You don't know what's gonna come out of it, but you just have to try.

264
00:12:12,180 --> 00:12:13,010
That seriously hurt!

265
00:12:13,580 --> 00:12:18,350
And being in there, you don't even know if Matsumoto is laughing, right?

266
00:12:18,350 --> 00:12:19,050
That's right.

267
00:12:19,420 --> 00:12:22,320
You must be feeling a lot of uneasiness while you're there.

268
00:12:22,320 --> 00:12:25,290
That's right, and that goes on for 6 hours.

269
00:12:25,690 --> 00:12:28,060
Those 6 hours are hell.

270
00:12:28,960 --> 00:12:31,260
But you know, at the moment I don't find it difficult at all.

271
00:12:32,330 --> 00:12:36,770
I mean, in terms of mental exhaustion.

272
00:12:36,930 --> 00:12:38,970
Doing it is extremely enjoyable.

273
00:12:39,040 --> 00:12:41,770
All of these hilarious people are gathered into one room.

274
00:12:41,770 --> 00:12:45,780
So having some self-control is obviously essential.

275
00:12:47,380 --> 00:12:52,020
It's like holding in your pee until the very last minute.

276
00:12:52,950 --> 00:12:56,390
And getting that laugh is such a relief after holding it in for so long.

277
00:12:56,620 --> 00:12:58,360
It feels really good.

278
00:12:58,660 --> 00:13:00,060
Even if it isn't something funny at all.

279
00:13:00,590 --> 00:13:02,090
Who was the worst of them all?

280
00:13:04,500 --> 00:13:08,430
It's gotta be Daisuke for me.

281
00:13:08,430 --> 00:13:13,540
We've known each other for ages so it's only natural.

282
00:13:13,540 --> 00:13:16,540
Daisuke Miyagawa's eyes go like this...

283
00:13:18,610 --> 00:13:19,140
Like that.

284
00:13:20,310 --> 00:13:21,950
He's cross-eyed!

285
00:13:22,550 --> 00:13:27,080
Looking at him just cracks me up.

286
00:13:27,490 --> 00:13:28,690
Play a round of 'Acchi Muite Hoi' (EN: 4)

287
00:13:28,890 --> 00:13:29,250
Sure.

288
00:13:29,620 --> 00:13:30,390
That's weird.

289
00:13:30,390 --> 00:13:31,460
Let's play some Acchi Muite Hoi.

290
00:13:31,460 --> 00:13:32,420
That's strange.

291
00:13:38,300 --> 00:13:39,430
You don't need that.

292
00:13:40,430 --> 00:13:41,170
It calms me down.

293
00:13:42,900 --> 00:13:43,900
I don't care.

294
00:13:45,840 --> 00:13:47,310
Wait, wait, wait, wait.

295
00:13:47,740 --> 00:13:48,570
He's cracking up!

296
00:13:48,570 --> 00:13:49,610
He's totally laughing.

297
00:13:50,170 --> 00:13:51,280
He's so busted!

298
00:13:54,880 --> 00:13:56,550
Daisuke...

299
00:13:59,350 --> 00:14:02,790
That's another monster for you.

300
00:14:03,120 --> 00:14:04,520
Ready, go!

301
00:14:07,330 --> 00:14:08,530
There's still some tissue stuck in there!

302
00:14:08,530 --> 00:14:08,760
Why do you have tissue paper there?
There's still some tissue stuck in there!

303
00:14:08,760 --> 00:14:10,030
Why do you have tissue paper there?

304
00:14:10,230 --> 00:14:12,300
You know, the other day we were drinking...

305
00:14:13,430 --> 00:14:14,170
Anyway...

306
00:14:16,130 --> 00:14:17,570
He just told me to thrust at him.

307
00:14:18,500 --> 00:14:19,500
Thrust?

308
00:14:20,270 --> 00:14:22,110
He put his hands on the table, like so.

309
00:14:22,740 --> 00:14:26,280
And told me to thrust into him from behind.

310
00:14:27,750 --> 00:14:29,510
What an idiot, what's he doing?

311
00:14:29,510 --> 00:14:31,550
He just started moving back and forth...

312
00:14:31,820 --> 00:14:33,120
Of course, he was wearing pants.

313
00:14:33,580 --> 00:14:35,550
But he was laughing out loud!

314
00:14:35,890 --> 00:14:38,060
I couldn't keep up with him.

315
00:14:38,060 --> 00:14:38,760
That's amazing.

316
00:14:38,920 --> 00:14:40,730
You know, he's twisted!

317
00:14:41,460 --> 00:14:42,530
That's crazy.

318
00:14:43,060 --> 00:14:43,930
He's crazy!

319
00:14:44,500 --> 00:14:45,300
What's funny about that?

320
00:14:45,300 --> 00:14:45,400
Right! What's so funny about that?!
What's funny about that?

321
00:14:45,400 --> 00:14:46,530
Right! What's so funny about that?!

322
00:14:48,370 --> 00:14:50,300
He's a monster.

323
00:14:50,970 --> 00:14:53,640
But I'm always amazed at how good he is on ItteQ. (EN: 5)

324
00:14:53,640 --> 00:14:54,270
Right, right.

325
00:14:54,270 --> 00:14:55,440
He's completely sane.

326
00:14:55,610 --> 00:14:56,840
He acts like a totally normal human.

327
00:14:56,840 --> 00:14:58,080
And he's super popular with the kids.

328
00:14:58,080 --> 00:14:58,180
That's right!
And he's super popular with the kids.

329
00:14:58,180 --> 00:14:58,510
That's right!

330
00:14:58,980 --> 00:15:02,950
But on the opposite side, he's such a maniac.

331
00:15:03,410 --> 00:15:04,420
I think it was Tamuken.

332
00:15:04,420 --> 00:15:05,250
Tamuken!

333
00:15:05,620 --> 00:15:07,250
He's also said the same "thrust me" to Tamuken (Kenji Tamura).

334
00:15:07,550 --> 00:15:09,390
-And Tamuken was also cracking up
-Just like that?

335
00:15:10,990 --> 00:15:12,190
It's not funny at all.

336
00:15:15,030 --> 00:15:15,930
I don't really get it.

337
00:15:16,060 --> 00:15:17,160
Me neither!

338
00:15:17,160 --> 00:15:19,400
But it is so funny whenever Daisuke does it.

339
00:15:19,400 --> 00:15:21,070
What's up with that?

340
00:15:21,170 --> 00:15:22,970
I remember what it was.

341
00:15:22,970 --> 00:15:24,670
We were talking about something...

342
00:15:25,040 --> 00:15:27,040
And he really loves Sukeroku Sushi. (EN: 6)

343
00:15:27,410 --> 00:15:29,270
So he had gone home, to his hometown...

344
00:15:29,270 --> 00:15:36,210
And his mom apparently told him they were having some Sukeroku sushi.

345
00:15:36,250 --> 00:15:38,950
He was so happy that his mom did this to him.

346
00:15:39,050 --> 00:15:39,680
From behind.

347
00:15:39,850 --> 00:15:40,950
I see... I see...

348
00:15:43,020 --> 00:15:45,060
He was like "For real?!" and his mom did this to him from behind.

349
00:15:45,190 --> 00:15:46,360
That's scary!

350
00:15:46,560 --> 00:15:47,990
He's totally out of his mind!

351
00:15:48,490 --> 00:15:50,900
All of those crazy people are gathered in one room!

352
00:15:50,900 --> 00:15:52,360
It's crazy.

353
00:15:53,460 --> 00:15:54,500
What was that sound?!

354
00:15:55,500 --> 00:15:55,870
It's fine.

355
00:15:56,170 --> 00:15:57,130
Don't worry.

356
00:15:58,070 --> 00:15:58,770
Please forgive me.

357
00:16:00,570 --> 00:16:01,340
Please forgive me.

358
00:16:04,540 --> 00:16:06,480
They end up laughing when there's nothing going on.

359
00:16:06,480 --> 00:16:06,680
That's right.
They end up laughing when there's nothing going on.

360
00:16:06,680 --> 00:16:07,810
That's right.

361
00:16:08,080 --> 00:16:09,550
And that's also funny.

362
00:16:13,120 --> 00:16:13,780
It's not funny.

363
00:16:17,150 --> 00:16:17,920
Not funny.

364
00:16:18,720 --> 00:16:19,890
Did you make this yourself?

365
00:16:20,320 --> 00:16:20,930
I didn't.

366
00:16:20,930 --> 00:16:21,830
I didn't make it.

367
00:16:23,130 --> 00:16:24,130
I really didn't.

368
00:16:26,930 --> 00:16:27,370
Huh?

369
00:16:30,070 --> 00:16:31,240
What was that just now?!

370
00:16:31,740 --> 00:16:32,640
What was that?

371
00:16:33,300 --> 00:16:34,740
I think so...

372
00:16:35,570 --> 00:16:36,370
One of the older people...

373
00:16:41,780 --> 00:16:42,550
Don't want it.

374
00:16:42,880 --> 00:16:43,710
You have to wipe-

375
00:16:49,890 --> 00:16:53,260
After looking at that I also end up laughing.

376
00:16:53,420 --> 00:16:56,890
And then the audience also laughs.

377
00:16:56,890 --> 00:16:59,000
It's all about objectivity.

378
00:17:00,000 --> 00:17:05,000
So at the end, when Cookie was pretty out of it, Kubota did an impression of Pikotaro. (EN: 7)

379
00:17:06,200 --> 00:17:08,070
It wasn't funny at all.

380
00:17:09,910 --> 00:17:10,910
But they still ended up laughing.

381
00:17:11,240 --> 00:17:13,040
Should I do that thing? The one trending right now...

382
00:17:13,440 --> 00:17:13,810
What?

383
00:17:14,150 --> 00:17:14,810
Pikotaro.

384
00:17:15,680 --> 00:17:16,110
Hmm?

385
00:17:16,350 --> 00:17:17,580
Pikotaro... Pikotaro.

386
00:17:17,580 --> 00:17:18,020
Pikotaro.

387
00:17:18,350 --> 00:17:19,180
He's really popular.

388
00:17:20,380 --> 00:17:21,790
I have a pen!

389
00:17:21,990 --> 00:17:23,820
But I'm gonna do a boring version of that song.

390
00:17:23,990 --> 00:17:24,320
Huh?

391
00:17:25,520 --> 00:17:26,620
That sounds interesting.

392
00:17:26,620 --> 00:17:27,220
Right?

393
00:17:33,200 --> 00:17:33,930
Ba-

394
00:17:35,100 --> 00:17:35,770
Nana!

395
00:17:37,600 --> 00:17:38,670
Banana!

396
00:17:39,940 --> 00:17:41,010
It's really bad...

397
00:17:41,010 --> 00:17:41,410
That's so bad.
It's really bad...

398
00:17:41,410 --> 00:17:41,840
That's so bad.

399
00:17:41,970 --> 00:17:43,810
That's how you make it popular.

400
00:17:44,410 --> 00:17:45,210
You make it boring.

401
00:17:46,180 --> 00:17:47,410
Just like that.

402
00:17:49,210 --> 00:17:49,610
Oh!

403
00:17:50,880 --> 00:17:51,180
E!

404
00:17:53,350 --> 00:17:55,020
Boobs!

405
00:17:59,320 --> 00:18:00,320
Right...

406
00:18:02,060 --> 00:18:03,360
That also happened...

407
00:18:03,630 --> 00:18:04,260
I mean...

408
00:18:05,030 --> 00:18:11,000
These days it's normal to laugh at something because of the fact that it's so boring.

409
00:18:11,000 --> 00:18:11,670
Really?

410
00:18:14,000 --> 00:18:17,110
Season 1's best moment must be...

411
00:18:18,480 --> 00:18:24,050
It must be Jiro Hachimitsu's collection of masks.

412
00:18:30,250 --> 00:18:32,560
This is the most orthodox mask.

413
00:18:33,420 --> 00:18:34,260
I know that one.

414
00:18:34,260 --> 00:18:34,860
I've seen it.

415
00:18:34,860 --> 00:18:35,530
Me too.

416
00:18:37,130 --> 00:18:38,130
Now it has hair.

417
00:18:40,260 --> 00:18:41,500
Did you add that later?

418
00:18:41,900 --> 00:18:43,100
Something like that...

419
00:18:43,100 --> 00:18:44,740
No, no, just salt and pepper.

420
00:18:46,870 --> 00:18:47,440
And some Soy sauce.

421
00:18:47,540 --> 00:18:48,970
Oh no, this is dangerous.

422
00:18:51,480 --> 00:18:52,280
You give up?

423
00:18:54,210 --> 00:18:55,110
Oh, it's got hair now.

424
00:18:56,550 --> 00:18:57,550
This one's a bit cute.

425
00:18:57,850 --> 00:18:59,450
It's like a Pierrot. (EN: 8)

426
00:18:59,450 --> 00:18:59,820
Right?
It's like a Pierrot.

427
00:18:59,820 --> 00:19:00,480
Right?

428
00:19:00,480 --> 00:19:01,790
It's quite interesting.

429
00:19:04,320 --> 00:19:04,790
Watch out!

430
00:19:05,020 --> 00:19:05,460
Ouch!

431
00:19:05,790 --> 00:19:07,060
Ouch! Ouch!

432
00:19:07,060 --> 00:19:07,830
Are you okay?

433
00:19:08,630 --> 00:19:10,060
You ruined the chair!

434
00:19:22,870 --> 00:19:29,080
Season 2
A Point System is Introduced

435
00:19:29,150 --> 00:19:30,750
It turned into a point system, right?

436
00:19:31,020 --> 00:19:38,920
I think this point system made the aggressive people even more successful.

437
00:19:39,190 --> 00:19:42,590
There's quite a few people that just go on the defense.

438
00:19:42,590 --> 00:19:44,800
So I had to make something to increase proactivity.

439
00:19:45,700 --> 00:19:51,340
And who's gonna benefit from this?
Yoshimoto is the only one, isn't he?

440
00:19:51,740 --> 00:19:58,140
Rumors of Documental's season 1 spread like wildfire throughout the comedy world.

441
00:19:58,280 --> 00:20:01,480
And you hear all these stories.

442
00:20:02,780 --> 00:20:03,150
Right?

443
00:20:03,150 --> 00:20:07,380
I mean, comedians are super excited once things like this come along.

444
00:20:07,720 --> 00:20:12,020
Simultaneously, you don't want to get invited... But if they don't invite you, it's like you're not good enough...

445
00:20:12,320 --> 00:20:14,660
It's a weird feeling.

446
00:20:15,290 --> 00:20:20,230
I mean, I was very honored by the invitation.

447
00:20:20,530 --> 00:20:23,170
There was no way I was gonna miss it.

448
00:20:23,530 --> 00:20:29,910
I'm really glad that Matsumoto called me over.

449
00:20:33,380 --> 00:20:34,350
It's Koji!

450
00:20:35,650 --> 00:20:36,050
See!

451
00:20:36,450 --> 00:20:37,510
There's people outside Yoshimoto! (Yoshimoto Kogyo)

452
00:20:38,350 --> 00:20:40,880
What's going on this time? This is crazy!

453
00:20:45,220 --> 00:20:46,320
Kotoge!

454
00:20:46,320 --> 00:20:47,460
It's so stacked!

455
00:20:47,690 --> 00:20:48,460
It is super stacked!

456
00:20:48,460 --> 00:20:49,660
This season is super stacked!

457
00:20:50,430 --> 00:20:54,330
All these funny people from all over the place started coming out...

458
00:20:55,300 --> 00:20:57,530
And I thought, "It's gonna get crazy".

459
00:21:01,140 --> 00:21:04,040
This person's already got something shady there.

460
00:21:04,340 --> 00:21:05,110
Who is it?

461
00:21:11,950 --> 00:21:14,220
I was already expecting it to be a wild ride...

462
00:21:14,420 --> 00:21:18,620
But when Jimmy showed up with that weird outfit, I was like, "Why's this old man here again?".

463
00:21:19,190 --> 00:21:20,990
Like, "Don't come again!".

464
00:21:21,330 --> 00:21:26,600
I'm glad we got some people outside of Yoshimoto to change the air in the room.

465
00:21:28,400 --> 00:21:30,070
I didn't care for Kojima though...

466
00:21:31,870 --> 00:21:33,040
Call me 'Oshima', just as an example.

467
00:21:33,200 --> 00:21:33,970
Just as an example.

468
00:21:34,410 --> 00:21:36,210
-Oshima.
-It's Kojima!

469
00:21:40,310 --> 00:21:40,980
Get it?

470
00:21:42,550 --> 00:21:43,150
I don't...

471
00:21:43,510 --> 00:21:44,180
Just for that?

472
00:21:44,180 --> 00:21:44,380
That's just a waste of space.
Just for that?

473
00:21:44,380 --> 00:21:44,980
That's just a waste of space.

474
00:21:45,220 --> 00:21:46,720
I'm gonna do this multiple times!

475
00:21:51,190 --> 00:21:54,090
Documental is all about the 'boke' (funny) man.

476
00:21:54,390 --> 00:21:58,400
You either go to 0 or to 100.
You have to go all in.

477
00:21:58,400 --> 00:22:01,900
You have come crashing into the room like an asteroid.
The jokes wont' land otherwise.

478
00:22:02,030 --> 00:22:05,970
Because it's a room full of pro comedians that won't laugh at just anything.

479
00:22:06,040 --> 00:22:09,410
This show is not about cheap comedy, it's about impactfull comedy.

480
00:22:09,910 --> 00:22:13,080
Say you have something you're sure it's gonna kill...

481
00:22:13,280 --> 00:22:16,550
But then it bombs... That's so embarrassing.

482
00:22:17,450 --> 00:22:18,450
Okay, alright!

483
00:22:18,550 --> 00:22:19,350
-You said it yourself.
-Sorry.

484
00:22:19,350 --> 00:22:19,980
Jimmy, are you going next?

485
00:22:19,980 --> 00:22:19,980
Here comes Kotoge.
Jimmy, are you going next?

486
00:22:19,980 --> 00:22:21,120
Here comes Kotoge.

487
00:22:22,290 --> 00:22:23,150
Jimmy, what's this?

488
00:22:23,150 --> 00:22:24,090
What just happened?

489
00:22:24,090 --> 00:22:25,020
-This isn't it.
-That's not it.

490
00:22:25,360 --> 00:22:25,920
No way.

491
00:22:26,460 --> 00:22:27,760
It's super erotic.

492
00:22:29,930 --> 00:22:33,100
Taking the picture with a Polaroid is so erotic.

493
00:22:33,530 --> 00:22:35,870
It's really embarrassing.

494
00:22:36,570 --> 00:22:38,340
Because I have completely turned myself into the 'funny' man.

495
00:22:39,370 --> 00:22:41,170
That's really hard for me.

496
00:22:41,440 --> 00:22:44,880
You have to breathe through that barrier and see if you're any good.

497
00:22:47,340 --> 00:22:49,510
That's where you have to go hard.

498
00:22:50,010 --> 00:22:51,580
Saito did get zero points.

499
00:23:01,530 --> 00:23:08,570
The things I was planning to do and had prepared for that environment,

500
00:23:08,730 --> 00:23:11,340
were so much different from the reality of the situation.

501
00:23:11,570 --> 00:23:18,210
That might have been the hardest and most intense time in my life as a comedian.

502
00:23:18,210 --> 00:23:18,640
Yeah...

503
00:23:21,110 --> 00:23:24,150
What skills do you need to appear at Documental?

504
00:23:24,450 --> 00:23:26,950
Right...

505
00:23:28,250 --> 00:23:29,120
Well...

506
00:23:30,590 --> 00:23:34,990
You've got to be creative when everything has been taken from you.

507
00:23:35,330 --> 00:23:40,100
At first everyone is a bit flustered and they waddle through most of it.

508
00:23:40,830 --> 00:23:44,230
But most of their material doesn't go the way they planned.

509
00:23:44,670 --> 00:23:49,070
Most of them have probably used all their weapons by the first hour or so.

510
00:23:50,410 --> 00:23:52,180
The challenge comes after that.

511
00:23:53,680 --> 00:23:53,940
Huh?

512
00:23:53,940 --> 00:23:54,780
What are you doing?

513
00:23:59,880 --> 00:24:01,020
What are you doing?

514
00:24:01,020 --> 00:24:01,450
Right!

515
00:24:01,990 --> 00:24:02,420
Huh?

516
00:24:02,850 --> 00:24:03,120
Huh?

517
00:24:03,920 --> 00:24:04,790
What's he doing?

518
00:24:19,440 --> 00:24:21,170
I might have my favorites...

519
00:24:22,470 --> 00:24:24,810
But I think Fujimon is always funny.

520
00:24:24,810 --> 00:24:26,140
He really is.
But I think Fujimon is always funny.

521
00:24:26,140 --> 00:24:26,180
But I think Fujimon is always funny.

522
00:24:26,440 --> 00:24:28,450
But he's always getting bashed in the comments.

523
00:24:29,950 --> 00:24:30,810
Poor guy!

524
00:24:30,810 --> 00:24:31,180
And everyone's always saying I'm too lenient on him.
Poor guy!

525
00:24:31,180 --> 00:24:32,680
And everyone's always saying I'm too lenient on him.

526
00:24:32,880 --> 00:24:33,750
But I'm really not.

527
00:24:33,750 --> 00:24:34,650
Yes, there's no way.
But I'm really not.

528
00:24:34,650 --> 00:24:35,120
But I'm really not.

529
00:24:35,420 --> 00:24:38,390
Cookie said Fujimon was amazing.

530
00:24:38,390 --> 00:24:38,860
He is.

531
00:24:39,090 --> 00:24:39,790
It's frightening.

532
00:24:39,790 --> 00:24:39,990
Right.

533
00:24:39,990 --> 00:24:40,460
Everyone else is just pretending to hear the jokes.
Right.

534
00:24:40,460 --> 00:24:43,890
Everyone else is just pretending to hear the jokes.

535
00:24:44,190 --> 00:24:45,360
They're not trying to listen.

536
00:24:45,660 --> 00:24:47,760
They're just looking but aren't actively trying to process the jokes in their minds.

537
00:24:47,970 --> 00:24:50,630
But Fujimon is always listening carefully.

538
00:24:51,030 --> 00:24:52,040
And he adds a joke here and there.

539
00:24:52,240 --> 00:24:53,770
Oh, hold on.

540
00:24:55,710 --> 00:24:56,870
You've got a beard...

541
00:24:58,710 --> 00:24:59,510
And sunglasses...

542
00:25:00,980 --> 00:25:02,550
A beard and sunglasses... Who?

543
00:25:04,050 --> 00:25:04,920
You must be Kazuyuki Izutsu. (EN: 9)

544
00:25:04,920 --> 00:25:06,950
You're wrong, you're wrong!

545
00:25:09,120 --> 00:25:09,820
What?

546
00:25:09,890 --> 00:25:10,550
Are you telling me I'm wrong?

547
00:25:10,550 --> 00:25:10,920
My memories!
Are you telling me I'm wrong?

548
00:25:10,920 --> 00:25:12,390
My memories!

549
00:25:12,390 --> 00:25:12,960
You just flipped it.

550
00:25:15,830 --> 00:25:16,790
Today at Shibuya:

551
00:25:17,030 --> 00:25:17,930
5 o'clock!

552
00:25:18,400 --> 00:25:19,430
See? It must be him.

553
00:25:19,600 --> 00:25:20,030
Right?

554
00:25:20,200 --> 00:25:21,770
That must be it.

555
00:25:23,730 --> 00:25:24,570
Today at Yoyogi:

556
00:25:24,770 --> 00:25:25,770
5 o'clock!

557
00:25:28,310 --> 00:25:28,770
There you go!

558
00:25:30,510 --> 00:25:32,540
Everyone else is just letting him do his thing.

559
00:25:32,980 --> 00:25:34,340
But he is a true comedian.

560
00:25:34,340 --> 00:25:37,050
He keeps saying the right stuff at the right moment.

561
00:25:37,280 --> 00:25:38,780
I think so too.

562
00:25:38,780 --> 00:25:42,750
But it doesn't seem to be reaching our audience.

563
00:25:42,890 --> 00:25:45,220
I also hear Goto is amazing.

564
00:25:45,460 --> 00:25:48,360
And our audience seems to think so as well.

565
00:25:48,860 --> 00:25:50,330
But no one likes Fujimon.

566
00:25:50,330 --> 00:25:53,030
I really do hope they start looking at him more.

567
00:25:53,800 --> 00:25:55,200
He's doing so much work, right?

568
00:25:55,200 --> 00:25:55,500
He really is!
He's doing so much work, right?

569
00:25:55,500 --> 00:25:55,800
He really is!

570
00:25:55,800 --> 00:25:57,070
He's actually working so hard.
He really is!

571
00:25:57,070 --> 00:25:57,330
He really is!

572
00:25:57,330 --> 00:25:57,400
But remember when he missed one season due to another commitment?
He really is!

573
00:25:57,400 --> 00:26:01,770
But remember when he missed one season due to another commitment?

574
00:26:02,210 --> 00:26:05,540
In our post-recording review, we found out that Fujimon added a lot to the room.

575
00:26:05,540 --> 00:26:06,710
By not being there?
In our post-recording review, we found out that Fujimon added a lot to the room.

576
00:26:06,710 --> 00:26:10,010
In our post-recording review, we found out that Fujimon added a lot to the room.

577
00:26:10,750 --> 00:26:13,420
But I bet they're still gonna bash him in the comments next time.

578
00:26:13,820 --> 00:26:15,820
I'm sure of it.

579
00:26:15,990 --> 00:26:18,190
Everyone thinks the judge is too lenient on me.

580
00:26:18,420 --> 00:26:19,320
How would I know?!

581
00:26:21,760 --> 00:26:23,830
I mean, I hear it from time to time.

582
00:26:24,060 --> 00:26:27,460
There's nothing I can do about that!

583
00:26:27,860 --> 00:26:28,300
Right?

584
00:26:29,900 --> 00:26:32,970
Kotoge was also incredible.

585
00:26:33,300 --> 00:26:34,840
His body got all banged up.

586
00:26:34,840 --> 00:26:35,840
He was full of injuries.

587
00:26:36,670 --> 00:26:39,540
He went a bit too far.

588
00:26:40,710 --> 00:26:41,380
Akira! Akira! (EN: 10)

589
00:26:41,380 --> 00:26:41,610
Let's go!

590
00:26:41,610 --> 00:26:42,280
Here we go!

591
00:26:42,280 --> 00:26:42,780
Ready?

592
00:26:44,180 --> 00:26:45,280
Shake! Shake! Shake! Shake!

593
00:26:47,250 --> 00:26:47,680
Ouch!

594
00:26:47,850 --> 00:26:48,250
Are you okay?

595
00:26:49,690 --> 00:26:52,090
Ouch! Ouch! Ouch! Ouch! Ouch! Ouch!

596
00:26:52,190 --> 00:26:54,420
Stop! Stop! Stop! Stop! Ouch! Ouch! Ouch! Ouch!

597
00:26:54,790 --> 00:26:55,660
Ouch! Ouch! Ouch!

598
00:26:55,660 --> 00:26:56,490
More! More!

599
00:26:56,630 --> 00:26:58,400
They are super stretchy!

600
00:26:59,860 --> 00:27:02,570
Fujimoto! My nipples won't go back now!

601
00:27:03,070 --> 00:27:03,900
What am I gonna do?!

602
00:27:04,870 --> 00:27:06,140
Well, yeah...

603
00:27:06,600 --> 00:27:08,510
In the end it had to be Kotoge.

604
00:27:09,010 --> 00:27:11,880
I had to laugh when Kotoge was doing absolutely nothing.

605
00:27:13,410 --> 00:27:16,810
But you had an amazing look on your face. I saw you from the back.

606
00:27:22,220 --> 00:27:23,120
Hold on.

607
00:27:23,490 --> 00:27:24,390
Hold on!

608
00:27:24,990 --> 00:27:27,290
Everyone just turned around and looked directly at Kotoge.

609
00:27:27,460 --> 00:27:28,630
We were waiting for something.

610
00:27:29,360 --> 00:27:31,600
But he didn't do anything.

611
00:27:33,100 --> 00:27:34,770
He wasn't aiming for anything with that stunt.

612
00:27:35,300 --> 00:27:37,100
That guy's beyond help.

613
00:27:37,230 --> 00:27:44,240
There's no other place as funny as that.

614
00:27:45,080 --> 00:27:45,680
Ouch!

615
00:27:47,280 --> 00:27:48,180
Ouch!

616
00:27:48,710 --> 00:27:53,550
It's a place where fun and tension coexist.

617
00:27:54,120 --> 00:27:57,220
You don't find that very often.

618
00:27:58,590 --> 00:28:03,560
But I always wonder why everyone just keeps wandering in circles.
They just can't sit still.

619
00:28:03,630 --> 00:28:07,800
The ones that do actually sit down are Fujimon or Goto.

620
00:28:08,230 --> 00:28:11,370
But everyone else is always walking around.

621
00:28:11,370 --> 00:28:15,470
What is going on there? Why are they moving so much?

622
00:28:15,840 --> 00:28:16,840
I think it's that...

623
00:28:17,040 --> 00:28:19,680
I'm sorry for bringing up the 'porn' example again.

624
00:28:20,110 --> 00:28:24,050
But at times, they all look like those porn doubles they use just for the semen.

625
00:28:24,680 --> 00:28:27,020
They are just walking around, waiting to ejaculate.

626
00:28:27,520 --> 00:28:29,120
They're just jerking each other off.

627
00:28:29,120 --> 00:28:29,750
I see.

628
00:28:29,750 --> 00:28:30,420
That's why they wander around.

629
00:28:31,560 --> 00:28:33,390
They're just walking and jerking each other off.

630
00:28:33,390 --> 00:28:33,860
I see.

631
00:28:33,860 --> 00:28:35,230
This is a jerking house.

632
00:28:36,130 --> 00:28:36,830
Comedian jerking house.

633
00:28:37,260 --> 00:28:39,430
"I just wanted to stay in the room as long as possible."

634
00:28:40,230 --> 00:28:41,200
That's what I was thinking.

635
00:28:41,200 --> 00:28:41,730
The whole time...

636
00:28:41,730 --> 00:28:42,130
Right.

637
00:28:42,470 --> 00:28:46,840
But I was so shocked when Fujimoto was eliminated.

638
00:28:47,200 --> 00:28:49,540
I thought, "What am I gonna do now?".

639
00:28:49,870 --> 00:28:55,910
Kotoge vs Saito
Sudden Death with 10 minutes 57 seconds on the clock

640
00:29:01,850 --> 00:29:02,790
-Hey!
-Hey!

641
00:29:02,790 --> 00:29:04,090
-You bastard!
-You wanna go?!

642
00:29:04,320 --> 00:29:07,690
I was very lucky to get Kotoge as my final opponent.

643
00:29:07,960 --> 00:29:10,030
I have always admired him.

644
00:29:10,430 --> 00:29:14,000
I've been in this business for about 21 years now.

645
00:29:14,000 --> 00:29:16,330
But this was the most exhausting thing I've had to do.

646
00:29:16,600 --> 00:29:18,700
The whole thing was hard.

647
00:29:18,970 --> 00:29:19,600
Re-start.

648
00:29:21,140 --> 00:29:21,910
Alright!

649
00:29:22,940 --> 00:29:26,680
I just wanted it to end.

650
00:29:26,680 --> 00:29:29,750
There really wasn't anything left to do.

651
00:29:30,210 --> 00:29:31,280
You had to squeeze every last drop.

652
00:29:31,820 --> 00:29:37,750
It felt like there wasn't even a trace of fluid inside my body.

653
00:29:38,020 --> 00:29:39,420
The end was amazing, we didn't really expect that conclusion.

654
00:29:39,420 --> 00:29:41,320
That end was amazing.
The end was amazing, we didn't really expect that conclusion.

655
00:29:41,320 --> 00:29:42,230
The end was amazing, we didn't really expect that conclusion.

656
00:29:42,560 --> 00:29:46,000
Kotoge said he doesn't remember what happened at the end.

657
00:29:47,560 --> 00:29:48,130
Is he in trouble?

658
00:29:53,540 --> 00:29:55,710
I also felt like our time in there...

659
00:29:56,910 --> 00:29:57,570
It was...

660
00:29:58,180 --> 00:30:00,240
It was like we were transported to another world.

661
00:30:04,180 --> 00:30:07,280
The whole time I was thinking, "What am I doing right now?".

662
00:30:07,520 --> 00:30:09,520
"Is this right? Or wrong?".

663
00:30:09,590 --> 00:30:11,990
I didn't know if we were making comedy or not.

664
00:30:12,760 --> 00:30:15,860
It was just a frantic frenzy.

665
00:30:17,030 --> 00:30:17,760
What?!

666
00:30:18,160 --> 00:30:18,960
Look at me!

667
00:30:21,430 --> 00:30:22,400
Good! Good! That's good!

668
00:30:23,570 --> 00:30:24,800
I don't care!!

669
00:30:27,200 --> 00:30:30,910
Comedians might recognize how much of a feat this is.

670
00:30:31,210 --> 00:30:33,240
But I wonder how normal people see this?

671
00:30:34,180 --> 00:30:35,910
He was having sex.

672
00:30:36,650 --> 00:30:37,380
You're right.

673
00:30:37,680 --> 00:30:39,650
He thought the teddy bear had gotten pregnant.

674
00:30:41,220 --> 00:30:42,150
Did he come inside?

675
00:30:42,150 --> 00:30:43,550
He did come inside.

676
00:30:54,200 --> 00:30:55,100
The chicken is crying.

677
00:30:57,000 --> 00:30:58,970
It was the Joyman showdown. (EN: 11)

678
00:30:59,400 --> 00:31:01,400
I was like, "Can I win with this?".

679
00:31:01,840 --> 00:31:05,310
I was about to laugh when we did that.

680
00:31:18,720 --> 00:31:20,890
What the heck?! This is so funny!

681
00:31:21,590 --> 00:31:22,590
Hilarious!

682
00:31:23,160 --> 00:31:23,930
That was amazing.

683
00:31:23,930 --> 00:31:26,300
I was really moved by that.

684
00:31:26,800 --> 00:31:30,770
That's why there's a lot of people that think season 2 was the best.

685
00:31:31,200 --> 00:31:35,670
I guess it leans harder on the documentary side.

686
00:31:39,540 --> 00:31:41,080
Are you serious?!

687
00:31:42,280 --> 00:31:43,350
Are you serious?!

688
00:31:43,910 --> 00:31:49,520
Season 3
Zombie System is Introduced

689
00:31:49,590 --> 00:31:50,850
I was finally here.

690
00:31:51,760 --> 00:31:54,090
I felt like I was finally here.

691
00:31:54,090 --> 00:31:55,860
I had watched season 1 and 2.

692
00:31:56,690 --> 00:32:00,330
After watching season 1 I thought they'd invite me, but I was wrong.

693
00:32:00,960 --> 00:32:02,530
You were actually invited...

694
00:32:02,530 --> 00:32:04,400
Yes, I was supposed to be there.

695
00:32:04,870 --> 00:32:07,770
But that's all in the past, so let's sweep that under the rug.

696
00:32:08,770 --> 00:32:13,840
I don't really know why I didn't get invited to seasons 1 or 2.

697
00:32:14,680 --> 00:32:19,720
So I went out to Tokyu Hands in preparation for this battle. (EN: 12)

698
00:32:20,080 --> 00:32:23,190
I went out looking for a weapon.

699
00:32:23,190 --> 00:32:25,320
And what came out ahead was that funny looking pencil eraser.

700
00:32:26,320 --> 00:32:27,820
I'm seriously giving back your Frisk.

701
00:32:27,820 --> 00:32:29,330
Sorry, I have to go piss in between.

702
00:32:29,860 --> 00:32:30,560
In the fridge.

703
00:32:30,560 --> 00:32:32,800
Sure, sure, sure, sure...

704
00:32:33,130 --> 00:32:34,130
Whoa, that's crazy.

705
00:32:35,470 --> 00:32:36,000
Amazing!

706
00:32:38,670 --> 00:32:39,500
He laughed!

707
00:32:39,640 --> 00:32:40,240
-What?!
-Huh?!

708
00:32:40,240 --> 00:32:41,400
It's a tiny curry-rice.

709
00:32:42,410 --> 00:32:43,270
Goto is amazing.

710
00:32:43,970 --> 00:32:44,870
He's a mighty opponent.

711
00:32:45,780 --> 00:32:49,610
From all the comedians in Japan, he's probably my biggest weakness.

712
00:32:59,960 --> 00:33:01,490
Wait, wait! Hey!

713
00:33:01,490 --> 00:33:01,660
He's playing with electricity.
Wait, wait! Hey!

714
00:33:01,660 --> 00:33:02,660
He's playing with electricity.

715
00:33:10,100 --> 00:33:13,600
In Goto's case, he plays both the 'straight' and 'funny' man.

716
00:33:13,700 --> 00:33:15,370
He's a competent guy.

717
00:33:17,670 --> 00:33:19,440
This thing spurts out a ton of water!

718
00:33:20,680 --> 00:33:22,510
Does Goto even need to say that?

719
00:33:23,210 --> 00:33:25,950
He's commentating on the amount of water.

720
00:33:27,880 --> 00:33:31,050
I really discovered something new.

721
00:33:31,760 --> 00:33:34,260
I've never seen that kind of footage.

722
00:33:34,720 --> 00:33:36,330
How far does the tip stretch?

723
00:33:36,590 --> 00:33:37,490
The tip?

724
00:33:37,490 --> 00:33:38,030
The skin.

725
00:33:38,030 --> 00:33:38,830
The skin?...

726
00:33:38,830 --> 00:33:40,200
The foreskin...

727
00:33:42,330 --> 00:33:43,230
Amazing!

728
00:33:43,270 --> 00:33:44,730
This should fit in there.

729
00:33:45,140 --> 00:33:46,040
Oh, I think it does.

730
00:33:46,540 --> 00:33:47,240
It went in.

731
00:33:48,270 --> 00:33:48,970
Let go.

732
00:33:56,950 --> 00:33:58,580
That pencil eraser, was that one of Goto's?

733
00:33:58,580 --> 00:34:00,650
Yes, the ones he brought.

734
00:34:00,650 --> 00:34:02,920
He asked me if it would fit in there.

735
00:34:03,790 --> 00:34:06,590
It all happened at an unbelievable speed.

736
00:34:06,590 --> 00:34:08,760
I knew it would come back out, since I had put it in myself.

737
00:34:09,530 --> 00:34:11,530
But the exit velocity was something else.

738
00:34:11,590 --> 00:34:14,160
And the way it came out...

739
00:34:14,530 --> 00:34:15,870
It was unexpected.

740
00:34:16,600 --> 00:34:17,830
And so funny.

741
00:34:17,830 --> 00:34:19,940
You can't be laughing at that! You'll break it off!

742
00:34:20,600 --> 00:34:23,140
I just really wanna say one thing.

743
00:34:23,140 --> 00:34:29,580
People have the opinion that there's too many dirty jokes on Documental.

744
00:34:29,710 --> 00:34:33,980
But you know, I really believe there never has been a dirty joke on Documental.

745
00:34:34,380 --> 00:34:35,990
Those are not dirty jokes.

746
00:34:36,150 --> 00:34:38,860
They think were all laughing at some 'porn'.

747
00:34:38,960 --> 00:34:39,860
But we wouldn't laugh at that, would we?

748
00:34:40,560 --> 00:34:42,360
Because there would be nothing to laugh about there.

749
00:34:43,030 --> 00:34:45,230
Then why are we laughing at the stuff they do?

750
00:34:45,460 --> 00:34:48,330
We're not solely using our nakedness to make people laugh.

751
00:34:48,700 --> 00:34:50,570
Please don't judge a book by its cover.

752
00:34:50,570 --> 00:34:52,600
Those are not dirty jokes.

753
00:34:57,670 --> 00:34:58,270
What's this?

754
00:34:59,380 --> 00:34:59,980
A racket?

755
00:35:08,920 --> 00:35:11,960
So you introduced the Zombie System in season 3.

756
00:35:12,490 --> 00:35:13,920
This was one of my inventions.

757
00:35:14,660 --> 00:35:18,530
Well that's all up to the comedian itself.

758
00:35:18,930 --> 00:35:21,500
We were all up to the task.

759
00:35:21,930 --> 00:35:24,970
If you make everyone laugh, was it a draw? Or something like that?

760
00:35:25,500 --> 00:35:28,370
-All the money goes back to its owner.
-That's right, no-contest.

761
00:35:29,110 --> 00:35:30,240
Right...

762
00:35:30,410 --> 00:35:32,880
You can also make teams with this new system.

763
00:35:33,680 --> 00:35:38,920
So I think it blew a breath of fresh air into the game.

764
00:35:39,350 --> 00:35:41,950
Zombie Time!

765
00:35:53,300 --> 00:35:54,000
Hello!

766
00:35:54,460 --> 00:35:55,200
I'm Terance Lee. (EN: 13)

767
00:35:58,570 --> 00:36:01,600
You see, today I brought a teddy bear along with me.

768
00:36:02,340 --> 00:36:03,140
A teddy bear.

769
00:36:04,010 --> 00:36:04,940
Teddy bear, come!

770
00:36:05,880 --> 00:36:06,940
Daddy...

771
00:36:06,940 --> 00:36:07,510
Come!

772
00:36:07,640 --> 00:36:08,550
Daddy...

773
00:36:08,550 --> 00:36:09,180
Come, come!

774
00:36:09,280 --> 00:36:09,880
Teddy bear, over here.

775
00:36:09,980 --> 00:36:11,150
You're cute.

776
00:36:12,980 --> 00:36:13,580
So cute!

777
00:36:15,690 --> 00:36:17,720
They seem to be having a blast in the Zombie room.

778
00:36:17,720 --> 00:36:20,620
The Zombie room sounds so fun!

779
00:36:21,060 --> 00:36:23,790
I hope that's what's really going on beneath all the tombstones.

780
00:36:25,630 --> 00:36:26,930
Zombie Time!

781
00:36:26,930 --> 00:36:28,130
Here it comes!
Zombie Time!

782
00:36:28,130 --> 00:36:28,200
Zombie Time!

783
00:36:30,370 --> 00:36:30,970
Let's go!

784
00:36:32,140 --> 00:36:32,740
Scary!

785
00:36:37,910 --> 00:36:38,910
I'm fine.

786
00:36:39,740 --> 00:36:41,280
Get comfortable on the back couch.

787
00:36:41,540 --> 00:36:41,810
Yes.

788
00:36:45,080 --> 00:36:46,820
Mister, you're gonna take a shower, right?

789
00:36:46,850 --> 00:36:47,380
Oh, yes.

790
00:36:49,320 --> 00:36:52,920
I prepared the Chinese dress and the massage oil.

791
00:36:53,020 --> 00:36:57,530
I was thinking of performing some kind of massage if I lasted long enough.

792
00:36:57,760 --> 00:37:03,030
Then, Akiyama and I were talking...

793
00:37:03,130 --> 00:37:06,970
And I told him I had prepared something for "that" kind of massage.

794
00:37:07,540 --> 00:37:11,540
Akiyama already knew what I wanted to do at the middle of my explanation.

795
00:37:11,540 --> 00:37:13,510
He put on the Chinese dress right away.

796
00:37:14,880 --> 00:37:22,550
So we just did all the "that happened to me too" jokes we could think of.

797
00:37:22,790 --> 00:37:25,490
(Speaking in fake Chinese)

798
00:37:26,220 --> 00:37:28,160
This will feel really good, Mister.

799
00:37:29,760 --> 00:37:32,530
I thought of just ejaculating there.

800
00:37:33,160 --> 00:37:35,800
But... I just ended up with a semi-boner.

801
00:37:35,800 --> 00:37:38,000
Even after Akiyama's real handjob.

802
00:37:38,870 --> 00:37:39,700
Can you do this?

803
00:37:39,700 --> 00:37:41,300
Of course Mister, this is a freebie.

804
00:37:41,300 --> 00:37:41,700
Okay.

805
00:37:41,700 --> 00:37:42,340
Okay!

806
00:37:42,340 --> 00:37:42,810
Alright!

807
00:37:42,810 --> 00:37:43,440
Are you allowed to do this?

808
00:37:43,740 --> 00:37:45,240
I really wanted to just cum there.

809
00:37:45,580 --> 00:37:48,540
I figured it would be so funny if his hands were all sticky afterwards.

810
00:37:51,480 --> 00:37:54,680
I've never wanted to get a boner so bad in my whole life.

811
00:37:56,750 --> 00:38:00,120
I also thought it would be a bit funnier if he actually got a boner.

812
00:38:00,190 --> 00:38:02,390
Akiyama didn't know he was trying to get a boner.

813
00:38:02,560 --> 00:38:03,530
He was really desperate.

814
00:38:03,730 --> 00:38:05,190
And Koba was well aware of that.

815
00:38:05,300 --> 00:38:06,600
So he was like, "Get up! Get up!".

816
00:38:06,700 --> 00:38:08,330
But he couldn't get a boner!

817
00:38:08,600 --> 00:38:12,800
Both of them thought it would be hilarious if he got a boner, but it didn't happen in the end.

818
00:38:13,440 --> 00:38:16,470
There might be some people using Viagra in the future.

819
00:38:16,470 --> 00:38:17,070
Right?

820
00:38:17,470 --> 00:38:18,110
For real.

821
00:38:20,480 --> 00:38:23,150
(Speaking in fake Chinese)

822
00:38:23,350 --> 00:38:29,450
Season 3
The Second Winner of 10 Million Yen.

823
00:38:29,450 --> 00:38:30,120
Did you cut it?

824
00:38:33,860 --> 00:38:34,790
Did you tear it up?

825
00:38:36,490 --> 00:38:37,690
This is the worst.

826
00:38:38,930 --> 00:38:40,400
Let's leave it at that.

827
00:38:42,300 --> 00:38:43,400
It's always the same...

828
00:38:44,430 --> 00:38:46,470
So you went to the finals with Kinoshita.

829
00:38:46,640 --> 00:38:47,240
Yes, right.

830
00:38:47,340 --> 00:38:50,370
And you had already gone toe to toe for the past 6 hours.

831
00:38:51,440 --> 00:38:54,880
Did you already know who would win at that point?

832
00:38:55,310 --> 00:38:56,150
I didn't know.

833
00:38:56,550 --> 00:38:58,310
It might be a lie.

834
00:39:03,920 --> 00:39:04,550
He's mad.

835
00:39:05,220 --> 00:39:09,990
You know, I thought Kinoshita had an advantage over me.

836
00:39:10,090 --> 00:39:15,000
And to tell you the truth, Kinoshita's picture was insane for me.

837
00:39:15,000 --> 00:39:19,400
The moment that came out I knew he had a point.

838
00:39:22,240 --> 00:39:22,870
What are you licking?

839
00:39:23,440 --> 00:39:24,270
The ones from before.

840
00:39:30,550 --> 00:39:33,180
That was also an accidental by-product.

841
00:39:33,450 --> 00:39:34,950
I really couldn't do much.

842
00:39:36,150 --> 00:39:39,920
So you didn't know who was the winner until Matsumoto announced it, right?

843
00:39:39,920 --> 00:39:40,160
Yes.
So you didn't know who was the winner until Matsumoto announced it, right?

844
00:39:40,160 --> 00:39:41,490
So you didn't know who was the winner until Matsumoto announced it, right?

845
00:39:41,590 --> 00:39:42,490
We didn't know.

846
00:39:42,890 --> 00:39:43,590
The winner is...

847
00:39:43,590 --> 00:39:43,990
Yes!

848
00:39:46,460 --> 00:39:47,160
Yamamoto!

849
00:39:49,070 --> 00:39:49,800
Me?!

850
00:39:49,800 --> 00:39:51,670
I see...

851
00:39:52,200 --> 00:39:53,200
Yamamoto wins!

852
00:39:55,040 --> 00:39:56,040
Congratulations!

853
00:40:01,680 --> 00:40:03,510
I was destroyed by Oshima's panties.

854
00:40:04,350 --> 00:40:05,520
It was nothing crazy.

855
00:40:05,520 --> 00:40:06,650
But just looking at them, they were dirty.

856
00:40:06,650 --> 00:40:08,720
More than dirty, they were super old.

857
00:40:09,420 --> 00:40:15,160
And then someone went, "What is this? It's so dirty!".

858
00:40:15,930 --> 00:40:18,530
"Did you play baseball in these?".

859
00:40:20,900 --> 00:40:22,230
Jimmy, let's take a good look at them.

860
00:40:22,570 --> 00:40:23,770
Let's take a good look.

861
00:40:23,770 --> 00:40:24,330
What is it?

862
00:40:24,900 --> 00:40:26,340
I don't know, just some panties.

863
00:40:28,070 --> 00:40:28,640
Those are huge.

864
00:40:29,010 --> 00:40:29,740
Are those Oshima's?

865
00:40:30,540 --> 00:40:30,870
Yeah.

866
00:40:32,140 --> 00:40:32,740
Aren't they big?

867
00:40:33,540 --> 00:40:34,580
What's with this color?

868
00:40:34,680 --> 00:40:36,010
But the back is clean.

869
00:40:36,080 --> 00:40:38,010
D-Did you play baseball in these?

870
00:40:38,010 --> 00:40:38,650
They're so dirty.

871
00:40:38,920 --> 00:40:39,450
A ball of hair!

872
00:40:40,080 --> 00:40:41,180
Did you put these on and play some ball?

873
00:40:44,590 --> 00:40:46,820
What the hell was that question?
Baseball?

874
00:40:47,660 --> 00:40:49,260
It's hilarious.

875
00:40:52,160 --> 00:40:54,560
Too many things made me laugh...

876
00:40:55,400 --> 00:40:59,040
But I think the best one was when he was wearing those weird glasses and started cracking up.

877
00:40:59,170 --> 00:41:00,400
I see, I see...

878
00:41:02,140 --> 00:41:03,040
Whoa!

879
00:41:03,440 --> 00:41:04,410
That's a lot.

880
00:41:26,230 --> 00:41:31,030
Stopping there was a lifesaver for me.

881
00:41:31,400 --> 00:41:33,970
If they hadn't pressed the stop button, I would have laughed to eternity at his appearance.

882
00:41:34,740 --> 00:41:39,380
For me it was RG's impression of Konjakuan's Master. (EN: 14)

883
00:41:39,680 --> 00:41:42,750
You know, I was just there this morning.

884
00:41:43,850 --> 00:41:44,750
And the Master was there.

885
00:41:45,350 --> 00:41:47,820
He greeted me with an, "It's been a while!"

886
00:41:48,220 --> 00:41:49,220
And I just went on my merry way.

887
00:41:49,890 --> 00:41:50,650
Then we started the show.

888
00:41:51,350 --> 00:41:53,060
And I never expected that to happen at Zombie Time.

889
00:41:55,060 --> 00:41:56,690
I went like this the moment he came out.

890
00:41:57,690 --> 00:41:58,430
I cut all eye contact.

891
00:42:01,230 --> 00:42:02,530
It's Konjakuan.

892
00:42:06,970 --> 00:42:07,540
It's been a while.

893
00:42:09,310 --> 00:42:12,070
Hayashi... Rice...

894
00:42:12,510 --> 00:42:15,440
And RG even talks like him.

895
00:42:16,050 --> 00:42:20,120
You'll never know how similar it is until you go there.

896
00:42:20,420 --> 00:42:21,820
But that was crazy.

897
00:42:22,050 --> 00:42:26,660
Himura tried to do some acting with his belly.

898
00:42:26,890 --> 00:42:29,890
And that fell a bit flat, didn't it?

899
00:42:30,230 --> 00:42:34,060
But then he was trying to do it again.

900
00:42:34,130 --> 00:42:37,170
He was gonna do it after the first start signal...

901
00:42:37,170 --> 00:42:39,400
Then we went like, "Let's do it".

902
00:42:39,440 --> 00:42:40,940
And then the signal came!

903
00:42:42,040 --> 00:42:45,580
I played that part so many times.

904
00:42:46,910 --> 00:42:48,480
That was the scene for me.

905
00:42:48,680 --> 00:42:50,050
But there's still time, what should we do?

906
00:42:50,210 --> 00:42:51,210
Start after the signal?

907
00:42:51,610 --> 00:42:54,050
Sure, let's go after the signal.

908
00:43:08,600 --> 00:43:11,300
In what sentence, how would you describe comedy?

909
00:43:13,640 --> 00:43:18,710
For me it's when the joke develops into something I'd never think of myself.

910
00:43:19,880 --> 00:43:24,010
With that much time and all those comedians,

911
00:43:24,480 --> 00:43:28,520
there's bound to be some miraculous moments.

912
00:43:28,520 --> 00:43:29,920
The most memorable one though...

913
00:43:31,290 --> 00:43:32,790
Well, I was there...

914
00:43:33,520 --> 00:43:35,290
And Iwahashi was next to me.

915
00:43:36,590 --> 00:43:38,830
In front of me was Goto.

916
00:43:39,530 --> 00:43:45,300
And Goto joked about my pubic area, since I don't have any hair.

917
00:43:45,300 --> 00:43:45,940
You're all smooth ('tsuru tsuru' in Japanese) down there.

918
00:43:46,140 --> 00:43:49,840
That's right, he made a joke about my lack of pubes.

919
00:43:50,110 --> 00:43:53,710
And by pure chance, Iwahashi was folding an origami 'Tsuru' (crane) next to me.

920
00:43:55,980 --> 00:43:56,650
How was it?

921
00:43:59,750 --> 00:44:01,520
Oh, like this, and that.

922
00:44:02,420 --> 00:44:03,290
You're all smooth.

923
00:44:03,450 --> 00:44:04,850
Oh, right, like back in the day.

924
00:44:04,950 --> 00:44:05,620
Not like that.

925
00:44:05,620 --> 00:44:06,420
You're doing it wrong.

926
00:44:14,330 --> 00:44:18,300
That moment was so inspirational to me.

927
00:44:18,470 --> 00:44:20,870
I just joked about how smooth ('tsuru tsuru') he is...

928
00:44:20,870 --> 00:44:24,410
And he was folding a 'Tsuru' over there!

929
00:44:26,410 --> 00:44:33,950
Matsumoto, can you think of one scene that was amazing for you?

930
00:44:34,480 --> 00:44:36,950
Amazing? I wonder...

931
00:44:36,990 --> 00:44:40,520
I don't really remember.

932
00:44:40,890 --> 00:44:43,830
Sometimes, even I tune out a little.

933
00:44:43,830 --> 00:44:44,560
You do?

934
00:44:44,560 --> 00:44:48,900
That room is like an abyss of electronics.

935
00:44:49,830 --> 00:44:51,500
Though I know I shouldn't tune out.

936
00:44:51,630 --> 00:44:53,700
But I like that one.

937
00:44:53,870 --> 00:44:54,370
The little window?

938
00:44:54,470 --> 00:44:55,140
That's right.

939
00:44:55,540 --> 00:45:00,440
I like the sketches that use the little window.

940
00:45:00,840 --> 00:45:02,310
I think those are funny.

941
00:45:02,610 --> 00:45:03,050
Like Himura's.

942
00:45:03,050 --> 00:45:03,850
Himura's... Right...

943
00:45:03,850 --> 00:45:04,980
Yes, that was super funny.

944
00:45:04,980 --> 00:45:06,880
Jimmy's act was also funny.

945
00:45:06,880 --> 00:45:07,550
Yes.

946
00:45:08,680 --> 00:45:10,350
That guy is crazy.

947
00:45:14,890 --> 00:45:16,460
This one was really good.

948
00:45:16,630 --> 00:45:18,130
It would have been crazy if it was that thing.

949
00:45:18,130 --> 00:45:19,730
-It was so funny.
-And he tried so hard.

950
00:45:20,300 --> 00:45:21,960
-It was a very strong trump card.
-Yes.

951
00:45:22,230 --> 00:45:23,800
-It's similar.
-Were you aware of that?

952
00:45:23,800 --> 00:45:24,800
You're not laughing.

953
00:45:25,600 --> 00:45:27,100
We already watched you do it, you know?

954
00:45:27,670 --> 00:45:28,100
Kotoge.

955
00:45:30,640 --> 00:45:31,340
It's not doing it for me.

956
00:45:31,340 --> 00:45:31,610
It's the same thing.
It's not doing it for me.

957
00:45:31,610 --> 00:45:32,610
It's the same thing.

958
00:45:32,610 --> 00:45:33,410
That's just Jimmy.

959
00:45:33,680 --> 00:45:34,310
I'm not him.

960
00:45:34,480 --> 00:45:34,980
Jimmy, right?

961
00:45:35,240 --> 00:45:35,980
I'm not him.

962
00:45:35,980 --> 00:45:36,550
That's Jimmy.

963
00:45:36,550 --> 00:45:37,410
Poor Himura.

964
00:45:37,410 --> 00:45:38,050
Jimmy?

965
00:45:38,050 --> 00:45:38,310
Yes?

966
00:45:39,120 --> 00:45:40,320
You look the exact same.

967
00:45:41,450 --> 00:45:43,090
The only thing is your golden tooth.

968
00:45:43,090 --> 00:45:43,820
Right, right.

969
00:45:44,620 --> 00:45:46,090
This Himura is hilarious.

970
00:45:46,090 --> 00:45:47,660
This is so funny.

971
00:45:47,820 --> 00:45:48,720
I'm not him.

972
00:45:54,900 --> 00:45:56,030
Himura, thanks.

973
00:45:57,100 --> 00:45:57,970
Thank you.

974
00:46:09,410 --> 00:46:10,880
Scary, scary, scary.

975
00:46:17,750 --> 00:46:18,520
Hold on, I can't close it.

976
00:46:19,690 --> 00:46:20,260
He can't close it.

977
00:46:20,260 --> 00:46:20,790
Sorry.

978
00:46:26,460 --> 00:46:27,000
What was that?

979
00:46:27,760 --> 00:46:29,370
What's wrong with him? Really...

980
00:46:30,200 --> 00:46:32,170
He must have made that at home, right?

981
00:46:33,240 --> 00:46:35,340
He apparently cooked it in parts.

982
00:46:37,270 --> 00:46:38,140
The middle part has been boiled.

983
00:46:38,140 --> 00:46:39,240
Only the middle has been boiled.

984
00:46:40,610 --> 00:46:42,240
He told us the Konnyaku gets firmer if you boil it.

985
00:46:42,240 --> 00:46:43,050
Right.

986
00:46:43,050 --> 00:46:44,650
It's gotta have some integrity.

987
00:46:44,650 --> 00:46:46,520
And it has to hold everything with the string.

988
00:46:48,920 --> 00:46:50,350
He's 54.

989
00:46:52,350 --> 00:46:53,920
Actually, this time around...

990
00:46:54,290 --> 00:47:00,300
We will talk about what we call the legendary season 0, which we couldn't talk about or even mention its existence.

991
00:47:01,160 --> 00:47:02,900
I mean, it was just a big experiment.

992
00:47:02,900 --> 00:47:04,030
Right, an experiment.

993
00:47:04,130 --> 00:47:06,170
But we did it for 14 hours.

994
00:47:06,300 --> 00:47:07,840
That was amazing.

995
00:47:08,140 --> 00:47:09,840
We started to see different things.

996
00:47:10,110 --> 00:47:12,610
We had some horrible people.

997
00:47:13,540 --> 00:47:15,040
They wouldn't do anything!

998
00:47:16,250 --> 00:47:19,280
I couldn't believe there were people like that.
