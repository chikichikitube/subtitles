00:00:02,720 --> 00:00:06,650
Welcome to Wednesday Downtown,

2
00:00:06,650 --> 00:00:08,630
Ok ok, i've been paid so i'll be serious

3
00:00:08,630 --> 00:00:11,650
Let’s get on with our first presenter please

4
00:00:17,310 --> 00:00:20,770
Bakarhythm!

5
00:00:20,770 --> 00:00:23,840
Hello everyone, i'm Bakarhythm

6
00:00:23,840 --> 00:00:25,520
I'll get right to the point

7
00:00:25,520 --> 00:00:30,440
Currently in the variety industry there are many comedy contests

8
00:00:30,440 --> 00:00:34,480
Such as "M-1", "R-1", "King of Conte", "THE W"

9
00:00:34,480 --> 00:00:42,220
They are usually classified into types of segment, number of people, gender etc

10
00:00:42,230 --> 00:00:46,820
This time I bring a new type of competition

11
00:00:46,820 --> 00:00:48,390
Are there any others that can be done?

12
00:00:48,390 --> 00:00:49,730
It is this

13
00:00:50,540 --> 00:00:52,670
30-1 Competition

14
00:00:54,200 --> 00:01:00,680
This is a competition for short segments of 30 seconds or less
-So short

15
00:01:01,220 --> 00:01:05,110
As long as it is less than 30 seconds, any type of segment is fine

16
00:01:05,110 --> 00:01:08,220
Its not classified by type but instead time

17
00:01:08,220 --> 00:01:09,960
A new perspective

18
00:01:09,960 --> 00:01:14,650
I hope we can hold it every year from now on

19
00:01:14,650 --> 00:01:17,520
If the winner becomes popular after the championship, this may really happen in the future

20
00:01:17,520 --> 00:01:22,400
Has anyone become famous from Wednesday Downtown?

21
00:01:22,900 --> 00:01:25,670
Isn't there that dog thing?

22
00:01:25,670 --> 00:01:26,860
Mameshiba something, right?

23
00:01:26,860 --> 00:01:29,010
Yes, yes.
-Please remember it properly

24
00:01:29,010 --> 00:01:32,650
Apparently Downtown is doing well from this show

25
00:01:32,650 --> 00:01:33,870
Is that what you think?

26
00:01:34,460 --> 00:01:38,380
So, from the 656 groups that signed up

27
00:01:38,380 --> 00:01:43,880
40 groups were strictly selected to participate in the official competition

28
00:01:44,650 --> 00:01:49,490
The official competition is divided into 5 groups performing segments through video

29
00:01:49,960 --> 00:01:54,660
The five winning teams from each group will enter the final

30
00:01:55,730 --> 00:02:01,110
These five distinguished guests, led by Hitoshi Matsumoto, are the judges

31
00:02:02,400 --> 00:02:08,070
Who will be able to become the king of the first generation of the 30-1 competition?

32
00:02:24,250 --> 00:02:28,730
30-1 Grand Prix starts first with the A group

33
00:02:29,770 --> 00:02:33,110
1st is Chocolate Planet

34
00:02:33,110 --> 00:02:34,620

It's okay, it's okay. You can do it. Be confident

38
00:02:37,580 --> 00:02:39,850
Go on, go on

39
00:02:41,810 --> 00:02:43,710
Let everyone see the results of your training

40
00:02:43,710 --> 00:02:45,200
Go, go, go!

41
00:02:45,200 --> 00:02:47,600

00:03:03,860 --> 00:03:04,930
Oh come on!

45
00:03:05,220 --> 00:03:07,770
Be serious

46
00:03:07,770 --> 00:03:10,280
I didn't expect them to do such a standard one

47
00:03:08,700 --> 00:03:12,770

00:04:00,800 --> 00:04:02,320
I wonder if I can go up and say hello

62
00:04:02,320 --> 00:04:05,130
I might not have another chance, I better say hello

63
00:04:05,130 --> 00:04:08,350
Excuse me, can I shake your hand?

64
00:04:08,350 --> 00:04:10,130
I'm sorry. Thank you

65
00:04:10,130 --> 00:04:11,860
So, are you Mi?

00:04:11,860 --> 00:04:13,430

72
00:04:52,860 --> 00:04:55,010

73
00:04:55,800 --> 00:05:00,010

74
00:04:57,720 --> 00:04:59,010
Very famous

75
00:04:59,010 --> 00:05:00,380
Really? What a great lineup

76
00:05:01,500 --> 00:05:03,440
You dog is so cute!
-Thanks

77
00:05:03,440 --> 00:05:05,500
Wow your dog is very cute it
-Thank you

78
00:05:05,500 --> 00:05:07,780
Let it come and play with mine

79
00:05:07,780 --> 00:05:10,410
Sir, your dog isn't here

80
00:05:10,410 --> 00:05:12,050
When did it happen?
-I don't know

81
00:05:12,050 --> 00:05:12,930
When did it disappear?

82
00:05:12,930 --> 00:05:14,450
Why didn't you notice?

83
00:05:14,450 --> 00:05:15,560
Because I'm an idiot

84
00:05:15,560 --> 00:05:17,240
Did you leave it at home?

85
00:05:17,240 --> 00:05:19,240
My partner is at home, let me ask

86
00:05:20,110 --> 00:05:24,360
Hello? Yeah, that's great. Bye then

87
00:05:24,360 --> 00:05:25,580
That's great.
-Is everything ok?

88
00:05:25,580 --> 00:05:26,640
Tonight is hamburger!

89
00:05:26,640 --> 00:05:27,620
That doesn't matter at all!

90
00:05:27,620 --> 00:05:28,650
Bye!

91
00:05:29,100 --> 00:05:30,180
Great!

92
00:05:30,180 --> 00:05:31,480
A proper skit!

93
00:05:31,570 --> 00:05:33,410

94
00:05:34,360 --> 00:05:38,410

I participated in swimming training classes as a child

97
00:05:42,950 --> 00:05:45,740
But my speed was really not fast enough so I gave up after a while

98
00:05:45,740 --> 00:05:47,090
I started playing soccer again instead

99
00:05:47,090 --> 00:05:48,590
I played pretty well at first

100
00:05:48,590 --> 00:05:52,900
Event dream of entering the J League and going overseas to participate in the World Cup and so on

101
00:05:50,780 --> 00:05:51,830
This guy is awesome!

102
00:05:52,900 --> 00:05:55,100
It was an honor to work with my teammates

103
00:05:53,340 --> 00:05:55,100
Great nose

104
00:05:55,100 --> 00:05:57,020
Now there are more and more children who do not exercise much

105
00:05:57,020 --> 00:06:00,430
Please make sure they take part in sports and sweat a lot

106
00:06:00,430 --> 00:06:01,410
Thank you

107
00:06:04,000 --> 00:06:05,080
It's so hard to choose!

108
00:06:06,260 --> 00:06:10,080
7th is Nana Magari

109
00:06:11,050 --> 00:06:12,540
You

110
00:06:12,540 --> 00:06:15,380
Want to buy this for 20,000?

111
00:06:15,380 --> 00:06:16,400
What is this?

112
00:06:16,400 --> 00:06:20,780
This is a fictional dirty joke: GINMO

113
00:06:20,780 --> 00:06:23,450
GINMO, what is this fictional thing?

114
00:06:23,450 --> 00:06:24,850
How is it? Isn't it very colorful?

115
00:06:24,850 --> 00:06:26,070
I don't know

116
00:06:26,070 --> 00:06:27,780
Come on, buy it.
-I don't want it

117
00:06:27,780 --> 00:06:29,820
You won't lose out.
-I said no!

118
00:06:29,820 --> 00:06:31,570
Wait a minute...

119
00:06:31,570 --> 00:06:33,890
This guy... is married!?

120
00:06:39,050 --> 00:06:43,150
8th is Kimura Family

121
00:06:43,540 --> 00:06:46,080
The Kimura family decided on tonight's meal

122
00:06:56,770 --> 00:06:59,830
Tomatoes, scallops, and red peppers

123
00:07:07,060 --> 00:07:10,290
Italian fish and shellfish risotto tonight

124
00:07:10,710 --> 00:07:14,030
What is this?

125
00:07:17,570 --> 00:07:21,050
First of all, these eight from group A

126
00:07:23,110 --> 00:07:25,630
Pretty good group

127
00:07:25,630 --> 00:07:29,390
Oh, by the way, Bakarhythm will also participate in the decision-making process

128
00:07:30,550 --> 00:07:33,200
1 2 3 4 5 people will participate

129
00:07:33,200 --> 00:07:34,440
We do to?
-Yes

130
00:07:35,570 --> 00:07:38,040
Do we have to choose?
-Yes

131
00:07:38,200 --> 00:07:40,870
That easily?

132
00:07:40,870 --> 00:07:45,060
If they're low quality, we can easily decide

133
00:07:45,060 --> 00:07:47,710
Feels quite tough
-The level is very high

134
00:07:47,710 --> 00:07:53,920
Sorry, but please choose the most interesting group from the 8 groups just now

135
00:07:56,020 --> 00:07:59,620
How do you all feel? Considering the time is only 30 seconds, this is still...

136
00:07:59,620 --> 00:08:02,150
They really did great
-Yeah

137
00:08:02,150 --> 00:08:06,390
All the way from serious to messy.
-Yeah

138
00:08:06,390 --> 00:08:08,470
There were many very complete segments

139
00:08:08,940 --> 00:08:12,510
So who is the winner of group A?

140
00:08:12,510 --> 00:08:14,370
Please show your cards together!

141
00:08:17,490 --> 00:08:21,970
Nana Magari, Nana Magari, Iwahashi, Westland, Iwahashi

142
00:08:23,280 --> 00:08:24,580
Split votes
-Split votes

143
00:08:25,670 --> 00:08:27,990
In this case, Jinnai will decide

144
00:08:27,990 --> 00:08:30,770
I see, i'm good to decide

145
00:08:30,770 --> 00:08:31,810
Iwahashi or Nana Magari

146
00:08:31,810 --> 00:08:34,390
I was hesitating between the two groups
-Oh, yeah?

147
00:08:34,390 --> 00:08:35,040
I see

148
00:08:35,040 --> 00:08:36,550
Can I say it already?
-No problem

149
00:08:36,550 --> 00:08:37,960
PlusMinus' Iwahashi

150
00:08:37,960 --> 00:08:40,710
Iwahashi, I see

151
00:08:40,710 --> 00:08:42,520
Matsumoto, why did you choose Iwahashi?

152
00:08:42,520 --> 00:08:51,280
Well, he lasted the whole 30 seconds, he's really interesting

153
00:08:51,280 --> 00:08:54,710
The amount of things included was also a lot
-I see

154
00:08:54,710 --> 00:08:56,710
Ijiin also chose Iwahashi

155
00:08:57,320 --> 00:09:03,530
If the end is not so sharp it'll affect the overall segment

156
00:09:03,530 --> 00:09:07,190
But in the end... is it ok to comment so seriously?

157
00:09:07,190 --> 00:09:09,060
I feel like i'm under a lot of pressure

158
00:09:09,060 --> 00:09:12,770
Of course you should comment seriously

159
00:09:12,770 --> 00:09:15,890
They all signed up to do this

160
00:09:16,800 --> 00:09:19,270
What about you? Is it because of the similarity to your own work?

161
00:09:19,270 --> 00:09:22,230
No, no, although there's a sense of it

162
00:09:22,230 --> 00:09:24,110
I just thought it was really interesting!

163
00:09:24,110 --> 00:09:26,410
Yeah, the last line was really funny

164
00:09:26,410 --> 00:09:30,250
And, after all, this is the only star born from Wednesday Downtown

165
00:09:31,040 --> 00:09:32,540
Tooth Princess

166
00:09:32,540 --> 00:09:35,870
The first combination that relies on Wednesday Downtown

167
00:09:35,870 --> 00:09:37,560
Bakarhythm also went for Nana Magari
-Yeah

168
00:09:37,560 --> 00:09:41,030
They started with a disgusting beginning and ended with a cool ending

169
00:09:41,030 --> 00:09:42,300
I see

170
00:09:42,300 --> 00:09:43,260
This contrast is great

171
00:09:43,260 --> 00:09:47,390
So, the winner from group A is

172
00:09:47,390 --> 00:09:50,780
PlusMinus' Iwahashi

173
00:09:50,780 --> 00:09:52,340
So formal

174
00:09:53,140 --> 00:09:57,340
Next is group B

175
00:09:58,270 --> 00:10:02,350
9th is Tokyo Dynamite

176
00:10:01,850 --> 00:10:04,100
This lineup is quite impressive

177
00:10:06,020 --> 00:10:07,170
Welcome

178
00:10:07,950 --> 00:10:10,410
Beef stew

179
00:10:11,140 --> 00:10:12,240
Bread or rice

180
00:10:12,800 --> 00:10:13,510
Bread

181
00:10:14,210 --> 00:10:15,070
Bread

182
00:10:27,660 --> 00:10:28,710
Beef stew still not ready?

183
00:10:28,710 --> 00:10:31,020
Sorry, our family is in the real estate business.
-You should have told me earlier

184
00:10:34,570 --> 00:10:36,050
These two are really messing around

Your nostrils are so big

188
00:10:47,170 --> 00:10:50,780
Yes, I have big nostrils, after all I

Please go out with me

195
00:11:01,370 --> 00:11:03,840
Why why?

196
00:11:03,840 --> 00:11:05,450
Don't say it twice!

197
00:11:05,450 --> 00:11:07,870
That's where the sashimi goes!

198
00:11:07,870 --> 00:11:09,350
What is this?

199
00:11:12,280 --> 00:11:14,080
It's the same as usual

200
00:11:14,840 --> 00:11:19,090
11th is Manzara Demone

201
00:11:20,060 --> 00:11:21,420
Is this your first time stealing?
-Yes

202
00:11:21,420 --> 00:11:23,390
Take everything out.
-Okay

203
00:11:23,390 --> 00:11:26,170
Eh, what happened? How did you put it in?

204
00:11:26,170 --> 00:11:27,090
Sorry, also

205
00:11:27,090 --> 00:11:29,730
More? The paper bag is all wrinkled.
-I'm sorry

206
00:11:29,730 --> 00:11:31,700
Why? Why are there still things inside?

207
00:11:31,700 --> 00:11:33,210
I also stole a pre-charge card, i'll return it to you

208
00:11:33,210 --> 00:11:35,160
You also stole a prepaid card?

209
00:11:35,160 --> 00:11:37,910
Eh, why so many?

210
00:11:37,910 --> 00:11:42,500
I don't know what's going on.
-I'm sorry. I'm really sorry

211
00:11:44,120 --> 00:11:46,330
It's my first time.
-You're lying!

212
00:11:47,850 --> 00:11:49,520
Liar!

213
00:11:50,360 --> 00:11:54,520
12th is Inu

214
00:11:54,890 --> 00:11:56,620
No need to be polite today. Drink as much as you like

215
00:11:56,620 --> 00:11:58,600
Thank you boss

216
00:11:58,600 --> 00:12:00,800
Please let me pour your drink too.
-Thank you

217
00:12:20,530 --> 00:12:21,930
So, cheers!

218
00:12:21,930 --> 00:12:23,360
Get out of here!!

219
00:12:25,390 --> 00:12:26,290
I see

220
00:12:26,930 --> 00:12:31,300
13th is Takeo

221
00:12:32,170 --> 00:12:34,670
Sato, you didn't work at an izakaya, did you?
-Yes, I did

222
00:12:35,230 --> 00:12:37,430
But you're great, you'll be a manager soon

223
00:12:37,430 --> 00:12:39,640
Ahem. Thank you

224
00:12:39,640 --> 00:12:41,940
What's wrong? A cold?

225
00:12:41,940 --> 00:12:44,650
It's okay. I'll be fine if I take my medication.
-Really?

226
00:12:44,650 --> 00:12:47,980
Be careful not to catch a cold, what with the recent weather and all

227
00:12:49,270 --> 00:12:50,430
I'm fine

228
00:12:50,430 --> 00:12:52,300
You're fired

229
00:12:52,840 --> 00:12:56,320
People who snort medicine through the nose will all be dismissed

230
00:12:58,490 --> 00:13:00,260
What are you doing?

231
00:13:00,970 --> 00:13:05,260
No 14th is Koide

232
00:13:06,090 --> 00:13:10,410
I want to show you my collection of musician publicity photos

233
00:13:10,790 --> 00:13:12,190
This is KAN

234
00:13:16,610 --> 00:13:19,420
Next is Oe Sendi

235
00:13:23,840 --> 00:13:26,870
And finally, Toshinobu Kubota

236
00:13:30,170 --> 00:13:32,270
I'm Toshinobu!

237
00:13:34,290 --> 00:13:35,250
This guy is playing around

238
00:13:35,250 --> 00:13:36,560
Why did you call him here?

239
00:13:37,370 --> 00:13:41,570
15th is Mochu Gakusei

240
00:13:43,980 --> 00:13:45,980
Come see the barrel museum

241
00:13:53,190 --> 00:13:54,240
Barrels

242
00:13:54,240 --> 00:13:57,080
Yeah, barrels

243
00:14:07,390 --> 00:14:09,590
Thank you all

244
00:14:11,230 --> 00:14:12,760
That's it? Wow

245
00:14:12,860 --> 00:14:14,930
Nothing at the end

246
00:14:15,840 --> 00:14:19,940
18th is Jizonshin

247
00:14:21,390 --> 00:14:23,150
Welcome

248
00:14:26,890 --> 00:14:28,580
Elementary school students don't usually buy water

249
00:14:31,360 --> 00:14:33,950
Elementary school students don't usually buy water at the convenience store

250
00:14:35,270 --> 00:14:37,230
How much is your monthly allowance?

251
00:14:37,920 --> 00:14:39,150
300 yen

252
00:14:39,610 --> 00:14:42,200
You have to use a third of it to buy water?

253
00:14:44,460 --> 00:14:46,760
You will kill people in the future

254
00:14:52,630 --> 00:14:54,600
Wow, a tough choice

255
00:14:54,600 --> 00:14:56,480
Indeed

256
00:14:58,760 --> 00:15:00,960
It's a difficult group, isn't it?

257
00:15:00,960 --> 00:15:03,630
This group is very difficult

258
00:15:03,630 --> 00:15:06,050
Please vote

259
00:15:09,560 --> 00:15:14,130
There are many combinations I still want to see. I still have many more I want to see

260
00:15:15,200 --> 00:15:22,730
So, among these players, which group will be the winner of group B?

261
00:15:22,730 --> 00:15:25,070
Have you written it? Please raise your cards together

262
00:15:28,470 --> 00:15:33,080
Inu, Inu, Takeo, Tokyo Dynamite, Jizonshin

263
00:15:33,730 --> 00:15:36,730
The decision is made
-Inu wins!

264
00:15:36,730 --> 00:15:37,910
You have chosen Inu

265
00:15:37,910 --> 00:15:43,050
Yes, the content is very simple, but the point was great

266
00:15:43,050 --> 00:15:45,930
Jizonshin was close

267
00:15:47,270 --> 00:15:49,080
Coo went for Jizonshin
-Yeah

268
00:15:50,410 --> 00:15:52,840
Sort of speaks to my heart

269
00:15:53,370 --> 00:15:56,260
I also want to make such a fashionable sketch

270
00:15:57,450 --> 00:15:59,610
I have great respect for them

271
00:16:00,070 --> 00:16:00,710
Very interesting

272
00:16:00,710 --> 00:16:02,490
Jinnai went for Takeo

273
00:16:02,490 --> 00:16:03,870
I still want to see them

274
00:16:03,870 --> 00:16:06,470
You can't take medicine from the nose

275
00:16:06,930 --> 00:16:08,890
Absolutely not!

276
00:16:10,040 --> 00:16:14,190
But I did hesitate for a moment. Inu was also good

277
00:16:14,190 --> 00:16:19,630
Even just mentioning their names in this way is a very good thing for them

278
00:16:19,630 --> 00:16:21,610
But in the end, Inu got two votes

279
00:16:21,610 --> 00:16:25,310
So the winner of group B is Inu

280
00:16:25,310 --> 00:16:26,720
Interesting

281
00:16:28,620 --> 00:16:29,770
So awesome!

282
00:16:43,820 --> 00:16:48,450
Next is group C

283
00:16:49,480 --> 00:16:53,460
17th is Jeradon

284
00:16:58,140 --> 00:17:00,960
Hey, where did you take the princess?

285
00:17:02,230 --> 00:17:06,400
That woman, I tied her to the top of the tower

286
00:17:06,400 --> 00:17:08,490
What did you do? How is the princess breathing?

287
00:17:09,400 --> 00:17:13,210
The oxygen there is probably only enough for the average human to last an hour

288
00:17:13,210 --> 00:17:17,360
You can't go past without defeating both of us

289
00:17:17,360 --> 00:17:19,520
What are you going to do?

290
00:17:20,300 --> 00:17:23,520
Why're you the one that's responsible for speaking?

291
00:17:25,460 --> 00:17:26,780
Indeed

292
00:17:26,780 --> 00:17:27,610
Fun

293
00:17:28,160 --> 00:17:32,600
18th is Oswald

294
00:17:33,100 --> 00:17:36,340
Thanks, we're Oswald

295
00:17:36,950 --> 00:17:39,360
I want to buy an expensive thing

296
00:17:39,360 --> 00:17:41,360
There are two choices, and I'm still debating which one to buy

297
00:17:41,360 --> 00:17:43,360
I see, you are hesitating between what?

298
00:17:43,360 --> 00:17:46,920
I'm thinking of buying a road bike.
-That kind of good bike

299
00:17:47,360 --> 00:17:50,890
Or buy a golden retriever?
-That kind of big dog

300
00:17:50,890 --> 00:17:53,710
Yes, yes, yes, which one do you think is better?

301
00:17:53,710 --> 00:17:55,760
This really depends on the purpose

302
00:17:55,760 --> 00:17:58,360
Depending on the purpose I may be able to give an immediate answer

303
00:17:58,360 --> 00:17:59,250
The purpose of course is transport

304
00:17:59,250 --> 00:18:00,750
Then buy a road bike

305
00:18:04,520 --> 00:18:08,700
19th is Makino

Hello everyone, I'm the sea girl

311
00:18:19,130 --> 00:18:21,710
What? I'm not a real sea woman

312

314
00:18:23,640 --> 00:18:28,600
No, I caught sea urchins. Look!

315
00:18:29,360 --> 00:18:32,250
Ah, I also have sea urchins in my clothes

316
00:18:32,250 --> 00:18:34,910
No, this is my furry

317
00:18:39,220 --> 00:18:40,160
It feels so long!

318
00:18:41,030 --> 00:18:45,170
20th is TEAM Kondo

319
00:18:45,840 --> 00:18:47,470

Here's a song for you, Butterfly by KAELA KIMURA

321
00:18:57,510 --> 00:19:01,850
I'm sorry, I accidentally played the entrance song of Choushu

322
00:19:01,850 --> 00:19:03,230
Let me try again

323
00:19:09,410 --> 00:19:11,560
I really like Choushu

324
00:19:15,730 --> 00:19:17,470
What's with the pause at the end

325
00:19:18,070 --> 00:19:22,470

Just turn up the ribbon, just turn up the ribbon

329
00:19:35,190 --> 00:19:38,120
Turned into handcuffs for arresting prisoners

330
00:19:39,010 --> 00:19:42,280
7:47 pm Arrested for being too old-fashioned

331
00:19:42,280 --> 00:19:44,210
A bit of a mouthful, right?

332
00:19:46,450 --> 00:19:49,560
Anything can be done with gymnastic wear

333
00:19:55,050 --> 00:19:59,610
22nd is Mayurika

334
00:20:00,350 --> 00:20:04,050
Damn, this kind of place opened an interior decoration store

335
00:20:04,050 --> 00:20:06,600
Wow, what is this? So strange

336
00:20:07,280 --> 00:20:11,200
What is this, what is this decorative item?

337
00:20:11,960 --> 00:20:14,520
Look at this pose

338
00:20:15,020 --> 00:20:17,280
You can't hit a ball that far away

339
00:20:17,840 --> 00:20:22,210
There is a switch, ah what is this?

340
00:20:27,420 --> 00:20:29,700
It is a humidifier

341
00:20:33,190 --> 00:20:37,650
23rd is Okami

342
00:20:40,320 --> 00:20:44,820
I didn't want to kill you. It's all your fault

343
00:20:47,920 --> 00:20:48,720
Who is it?

344
00:20:50,700 --> 00:20:55,060
They're in, what should I do?

You've come at a bad time

348
00:21:03,970 --> 00:21:05,510
Very bad timing indeed

349
00:21:06,200 --> 00:21:10,510

The talented child singer from the country next door

352
00:21:16,690 --> 00:21:18,330
It's really not the same level!

※Original Song: Korean Nursery Rhyme "Bo Bo Song"

354
00:21:50,350 --> 00:21:52,990
This is the level I expected at the beginning

355
00:21:52,990 --> 00:21:55,930
A real mix

356
00:21:57,450 --> 00:22:01,330
The level is slightly lower

357
00:22:01,330 --> 00:22:02,590
Yes

358
00:22:02,590 --> 00:22:04,830
An easier choice

359
00:22:05,610 --> 00:22:07,600
Then please vote

00:22:22,900 --> 00:22:23,980
I see

363
00:22:23,980 --> 00:22:27,340
Matsumoto chose Kintaro

364
00:22:27,890 --> 00:22:29,610
Its Kintaro

365
00:22:32,710 --> 00:22:34,850
I can watch it for two hours straight

366
00:22:34,850 --> 00:22:36,630
Funny indeed

367
00:22:36,630 --> 00:22:38,100
Very funny

368
00:22:38,100 --> 00:22:42,530
Jeradon, I know

369
00:22:42,530 --> 00:22:44,980
That is actually the beginning of a longer sketch

370
00:22:44,980 --> 00:22:46,810
It is part of a sketch

371
00:22:46,810 --> 00:22:49,300
Originally part of the a longer one

372
00:22:49,300 --> 00:22:50,830
Bakarhythm also selected Jeradon

373
00:22:50,830 --> 00:22:55,400
Yes, the explosive ending was very strong

374
00:22:55,400 --> 00:22:56,650
So that's how it is

375
00:22:56,650 --> 00:22:57,790
Same with Coo?

376
00:22:57,800 --> 00:22:59,860
I hesitated choosing Raichou

377
00:22:59,860 --> 00:23:02,260
Raichou, you were on the fence about Raichou?

378
00:23:04,070 --> 00:23:06,250
Raichou (thunderbirds) don't hesitate, right?

379
00:23:06,510 --> 00:23:09,200
Only Jeradon and Raichou for me

380
00:23:10,240 --> 00:23:12,570
Raichou is very powerful, the gymnastics clothes

381
00:23:13,080 --> 00:23:16,630
Makino even managed to make 30 seconds feel long

382
00:23:17,290 --> 00:23:19,580
Felt like 4 minutes

383
00:23:20,320 --> 00:23:21,860
30-1 Grand Prix

384
00:23:21,860 --> 00:23:24,580
Next is group D

385
00:23:25,380 --> 00:23:29,580
25th is Warafuji Naruo

386
00:23:38,600 --> 00:23:39,420
It's so stupid

387
00:23:45,160 --> 00:23:46,270
You wont qualify!

388
00:23:47,630 --> 00:23:49,080
You will be disqualified this way

389
00:23:49,080 --> 00:23:50,350
You're doped up, aren't you?

390
00:23:50,350 --> 00:23:51,520
What the hell! Just get out!

391
00:23:51,520 --> 00:23:54,000
Hahahaha no i'm not

392
00:23:54,000 --> 00:23:54,880
What are you laughing at?

393
00:23:54,880 --> 00:23:56,020
That's not doping

394
00:23:56,020 --> 00:23:56,710
Isn't it?

395
00:23:56,710 --> 00:23:57,760
This is just taping

396
00:23:57,760 --> 00:23:58,860
Shouldn't have said it

397
00:24:03,170 --> 00:24:07,460
26th is Razor Ramon RG

398
00:24:05,540 --> 00:24:06,560
As expected

399
00:24:06,560 --> 00:24:08,340
It should be a good fit

400
00:24:08,340 --> 00:24:11,530
Question for Takushi Arisawa, the WedDownKing

401
00:24:11,530 --> 00:24:12,980
Super Hard!

402
00:24:14,570 --> 00:24:15,660
Down…

403
00:24:15,660 --> 00:24:17,990
It's too fast! Takushi Arisawa

404
00:24:17,990 --> 00:24:19,410
Please tell us your answer

405
00:24:20,060 --> 00:24:21,920
Okay, the answer is miso

406
00:24:24,900 --> 00:24:26,040
Beautiful!

407
00:24:26,040 --> 00:24:31,340
What is the seasoning in the miso that Downtown probably drinks in the morning?

408
00:24:31,340 --> 00:24:33,370
Miso Beautiful! That's it!

409
00:24:33,370 --> 00:24:35,940
Quick answer. Impeccable. Takushi Arisawa!

410
00:24:40,250 --> 00:24:43,540
27th is Daishizen

411
00:24:45,940 --> 00:24:46,760
Mini skit

412
00:24:47,510 --> 00:24:52,080
American father on a yacht trying to get his adolescent son to talk about his troubles

413
00:24:53,030 --> 00:24:55,020
Shota, why don't you try to steer too?

414
00:24:55,020 --> 00:24:56,170
Eh, can I?

415
00:24:56,170 --> 00:24:58,680
You're my son. You can do it.
-Yes!

416
00:24:59,620 --> 00:25:00,970
Aaaah!

417
00:25:01,420 --> 00:25:02,790
Heheh, you are too far to the right

418
00:25:02,790 --> 00:25:05,050
Are you going to drive to the Atlantic Ocean?

419
00:25:08,550 --> 00:25:11,960
I heard you don't get a seat on the school bus, what happened?

420
00:25:15,800 --> 00:25:17,390
It was about that?

421
00:25:17,390 --> 00:25:19,000
And a special ride on a yacht

422
00:25:19,850 --> 00:25:24,000
28th is President of Japan

423
00:25:24,520 --> 00:25:26,610
We have a transfer student coming in today

424
00:25:49,190 --> 00:25:51,890
I'm Nishihara from Koumei High School, thank you

425
00:25:51,890 --> 00:25:53,150
Why did you bring your own entrance song?

426
00:25:57,250 --> 00:26:01,200
29th is Robin Foot

427
00:26:03,920 --> 00:26:05,370
Are you all right, sir?

428
00:26:05,370 --> 00:26:06,200
Ahhh sorry about that

429
00:26:06,200 --> 00:26:07,980
I heard that there was a robbery?

430
00:26:07,980 --> 00:26:11,260
I told them I didn't have my wallet, and they stripped me all over

431
00:26:11,260 --> 00:26:15,150
Okay, I'll write a statement. Can you describe what was taken?

432
00:26:15,870 --> 00:26:17,520
Sunglasses

433
00:26:17,520 --> 00:26:19,270
Mask

434
00:26:19,270 --> 00:26:20,890
Trenchcoat

435
00:26:20,890 --> 00:26:21,740
Those things

436
00:26:23,270 --> 00:26:24,360
Ah, just three things?

437
00:26:24,360 --> 00:26:24,800
Yes

438
00:26:25,490 --> 00:26:27,100
Just took those three things?
-Yes

439
00:26:28,590 --> 00:26:30,930
Then we'll have to write another statement. Is that okay?

440
00:26:35,730 --> 00:26:39,840
20th is Zigzagziggy

441
00:26:40,090 --> 00:26:41,820
The pitcher throws the first pitch!

442
00:26:41,820 --> 00:26:43,390
Ohhhh, it's a dead ball!

443
00:26:44,250 --> 00:26:45,030
Eh?

444
00:26:45,850 --> 00:26:46,620
Eh??

445
00:26:47,210 --> 00:26:53,400
It hurts! You're... stop...it hurts!!!

446
00:26:53,400 --> 00:26:54,320
Why?

447
00:26:55,010 --> 00:26:56,310
Why... it hurts!

448
00:26:56,310 --> 00:27:01,910
Wait... is anyone there?

449
00:27:01,910 --> 00:27:04,860
Why are you doing this? Stop it!

450
00:27:05,780 --> 00:27:07,080
I'm a center fielder!

451
00:27:11,440 --> 00:27:13,180
That expression

452
00:27:13,760 --> 00:27:17,420
31st is Matsumoto Club

453
00:27:20,870 --> 00:27:25,130
♪Some women's underwear fell on the roadside

454
00:27:26,050 --> 00:27:30,920
♪Some women's underwear fell on the roadside

455
00:27:31,880 --> 00:27:36,150
♪While caring about the eyes of others, picking up

456
00:27:36,150 --> 00:27:39,980
♪Underwear, picked up

457
00:27:40,800 --> 00:27:41,850
♪So it was actually a hair band

458
00:27:43,780 --> 00:27:44,900
♪Hair band

459
00:27:51,660 --> 00:27:55,120
32nd is Hoko

460
00:27:55,820 --> 00:27:57,220
This guy is also a veteran

461
00:27:56,960 --> 00:28:02,860
In your mind, you must have the concept of "that thing looks like this" to imitate

462
00:28:03,770 --> 00:28:08,040
After all, to imitate is to be the same

463
00:28:08,040 --> 00:28:10,640
The important thing is whether it resembles the concept in your head

464
00:28:10,640 --> 00:28:12,740
We will now move closer to that "concept"

465
00:28:15,020 --> 00:28:19,850
Now this is the hairstyle of the fat girl in Doraemon

466
00:28:26,090 --> 00:28:26,710
I see

467
00:28:26,710 --> 00:28:27,960
Wow, this is too hard to judge

468
00:28:28,360 --> 00:28:30,330
The quality increased again

469
00:28:32,530 --> 00:28:38,170
Although it is indeed difficult to judge, but please write down your choice

470
00:28:41,770 --> 00:28:45,770
So, who will be able to enter the final?

471
00:28:45,770 --> 00:28:47,680
Okay, please show together!

472
00:28:49,680 --> 00:28:53,080
Wow, President of Japan got three votes

473
00:28:53,760 --> 00:28:55,280
So, they are the confirmed finalist

474
00:28:55,890 --> 00:28:57,560
Ijiin-san, what was behind your choice?

475
00:28:57,560 --> 00:29:00,230
I would like to see more
-Yeah

476
00:29:00,230 --> 00:29:02,680
I feel like I want to see more of this series
-Yes

477
00:29:02,680 --> 00:29:03,620
Very admirable

478
00:29:04,290 --> 00:29:05,210
Coo, you chose Daishizen?

479
00:29:05,210 --> 00:29:09,780
Yes, because of the explosion at the end to get a laugh that I chose them

480
00:29:10,460 --> 00:29:12,210
The three remaining people all chose the same person

481
00:29:12,210 --> 00:29:13,330
Jinnai, you chose President of Japan?

482
00:29:13,330 --> 00:29:16,700
Well, they were holding it in, and I was wondering where the hell it was going to explode?

483
00:29:16,700 --> 00:29:18,490
But in the end, it was more normal than expected
-So that's it

484
00:29:18,490 --> 00:29:20,400
Sure enough, the entrance song is still very funny

485
00:29:20,400 --> 00:29:21,720
Does Matsumoto feel the same way?

486
00:29:21,720 --> 00:29:25,670
There is a great sense of tension in the 30 seconds

487
00:29:26,240 --> 00:29:29,740
I thought the music would be played after

488
00:29:30,440 --> 00:29:31,160
What do you think?

489
00:29:31,160 --> 00:29:34,850
They make you think the student's reveal will be the funny part

490
00:29:34,850 --> 00:29:36,890
But in fact the joke is actually the song

491
00:29:36,890 --> 00:29:38,750
It contains a slight reversal
-Indeed

492
00:29:38,750 --> 00:29:40,490
It's fun.
-Got it

493
00:29:40,490 --> 00:29:41,750
In a nutshell

494
00:29:41,750 --> 00:29:45,030
President of Japan is advancing from group D to the final!

495
00:29:48,750 --> 00:29:53,050
Will the members of each group deviate too much from each other?

496
00:29:54,350 --> 00:29:55,140
True

497
00:29:55,140 --> 00:29:55,940
Really true

498
00:29:57,200 --> 00:30:00,790
If these guys are all in the same group they'd probably do something better

499
00:30:01,270 --> 00:30:02,540
That's true.
-Two or three of these groups are estimated to be in the final

500
00:30:02,540 --> 00:30:04,430
They just happened to be divided into groups like this

501
00:30:05,880 --> 00:30:07,560
30-1 Grand Prix

502
00:30:07,560 --> 00:30:10,030
Next is group E

503
00:30:11,480 --> 00:30:15,460
33rd is Stamina Bread

504
00:30:20,530 --> 00:30:22,040
Thank You House from 10 yen

505
00:30:22,770 --> 00:30:24,630
What the hell is "Thank You House"? Never heard of it?

506
00:30:26,180 --> 00:30:27,330
There's loads of coins

507
00:30:28,150 --> 00:30:30,100
If it's only 10 yen, its ok to try it once

508
00:30:30,850 --> 00:30:31,760
Thank you house...

509
00:30:35,430 --> 00:30:36,260
Thanks

510
00:30:39,980 --> 00:30:41,840
This guy's making an easy living!

511
00:30:47,270 --> 00:30:50,780
34th is Moriya Biyori

512
00:30:55,370 --> 00:30:57,100
My clothes have been hidden!

513
00:30:58,870 --> 00:31:00,570
It was definitely that guy who did it!

514
00:31:00,980 --> 00:31:02,260
What kind of bullying is this?

515
00:31:02,260 --> 00:31:02,920
Time...

516
00:31:02,920 --> 00:31:05,730
It's almost time for the show!

517
00:31:07,600 --> 00:31:09,350
It is obviously public assault

518
00:31:10,940 --> 00:31:13,900
I've already been interviewed by "Erotic Continent"

519
00:31:14,830 --> 00:31:16,300
Really can't find it

520
00:31:20,320 --> 00:31:23,880
35th is Robert

521
00:31:25,080 --> 00:31:26,820
Tokyo sure is prosperous!

522
00:31:26,820 --> 00:31:28,340
Hey, I'm in TV production

523
00:31:28,340 --> 00:31:29,910
Oh no an industry person

524
00:31:29,910 --> 00:31:31,350
The baldness of your forehead is incredible

525
00:31:31,350 --> 00:31:34,090
Soon there will be a camera crew passing by. Can you please give way?
-A camera crew?

526
00:31:34,090 --> 00:31:37,400
Eh, what are you shooting? It's awesome! Tokyo is really something!

527
00:31:37,400 --> 00:31:38,850
Who will it be? Any star?

528
00:31:38,850 --> 00:31:41,810
And then there's the fact that I've lived in this neighborhood

529
00:31:41,810 --> 00:31:45,180
Here's the point. Here's the point.
-What the hell kind of star is this?

530
00:31:45,180 --> 00:31:46,730
I can't even understand what he's saying

531
00:31:46,730 --> 00:31:50,410
Hello, I'm Washio.
-I'm being pestered

532
00:31:50,410 --> 00:31:52,460
So it's called Washio...

533
00:31:57,900 --> 00:32:02,270
36th is Rainbow

534
00:32:02,990 --> 00:32:03,500
Short skit

535
00:32:03,500 --> 00:32:04,280
Alumni Association

536
00:32:05,240 --> 00:32:06,070
Long time no see

537
00:32:06,070 --> 00:32:07,700
Huh? Ta-chan?

538
00:32:08,210 --> 00:32:11,070
Junko, you haven't changed at all since then

539
00:32:11,070 --> 00:32:13,260
Ta-chan you seem to be a little fat, right?

540
00:32:13,260 --> 00:32:16,300
Hahahaha, you sure are rude

541
00:32:17,030 --> 00:32:17,880
This kid

542
00:32:18,730 --> 00:32:19,640
Don't do that

543
00:32:20,710 --> 00:32:23,030
No one will act like they did in those days, ok?

544
00:32:23,030 --> 00:32:24,830
What're you talking about?

545
00:32:25,640 --> 00:32:26,580
Not like that!

546
00:32:30,720 --> 00:32:34,840

Ultra Boogies' new sports program

00:32:42,410 --> 00:32:43,620
Foul, foul!

549
00:32:43,620 --> 00:32:44,640
PT PT？

550
00:32:44,640 --> 00:32:46,190
Penalty, ok penalty

551
00:32:47,160 --> 00:32:48,730
Penalty ok?

552
00:32:48,730 --> 00:32:51,690
10 9 8 7…3 2 1

553
00:32:55,130 --> 00:32:55,840
It's over

554
00:32:56,940 --> 00:32:58,050
12 tissues

555
00:32:58,780 --> 00:33:00,410
11 tissues

556
00:33:00,880 --> 00:33:01,560

Ah, this is not the New Year's greeting certificate

560
00:33:16,330 --> 00:33:18,800
It says, "Happy New Year, please teach me more this year"

561
00:33:19,300 --> 00:33:22,280
The top has a New Year's atmosphere

562
00:33:22,280 --> 00:33:25,220
Wait a minute, take a closer look

563
00:33:25,220 --> 00:33:27,120
Its actually Heineken beer bottles

564
00:33:27,120 --> 00:33:28,530
Awesome!

565
00:33:29,520 --> 00:33:31,320
Ah isn't this mahjong?

566
00:33:31,320 --> 00:33:33,250
One two three

567
00:33:33,250 --> 00:33:35,080
Four five six

568
00:33:35,080 --> 00:33:39,220
Seven, eight ... hey isn't this the FILA logo?

569
00:33:43,510 --> 00:33:47,480
39th is Chance Oshiro

570
00:33:45,590 --> 00:33:46,370
He's here!

571
00:33:48,980 --> 00:33:53,940

Antonio Inoki in a money transfer fraud

Hey, hey...hey, hey, hey!

575
00:34:31,590 --> 00:34:32,370
It's me it's me

576
00:34:33,070 --> 00:34:34,740
It's me, it's me, it's me!

577
00:34:35,740 --> 00:34:36,960
Who is it? Who is it?

578
00:34:37,690 --> 00:34:38,780
Who are you?

579
00:34:39,280 --> 00:34:41,380
Ogawa, Fujita, Choushu?

580
00:34:41,380 --> 00:34:42,210
Who is it?

581
00:34:42,870 --> 00:34:43,900
I need money

582
00:34:44,600 --> 00:34:46,420
Sorry money

583
00:34:46,420 --> 00:34:49,260
Here a pun with money hahaha

584
00:34:49,260 --> 00:34:50,480
Pay the money!

585
00:34:54,490 --> 00:34:58,270
41st is DobuRock

586
00:34:59,290 --> 00:35:03,300
Takei Sou who can beat any animal

587
00:35:03,300 --> 00:35:06,470
I can make love in the face of any animal

588
00:35:06,470 --> 00:35:08,770
Then watch me practice make love with a lion

589
00:35:09,320 --> 00:35:11,350
If it is a lion, a little distance from it

590
00:35:12,170 --> 00:35:13,160
First do a few fake movements

591
00:35:14,500 --> 00:35:15,700
If it bites fiercely

592
00:35:16,280 --> 00:35:17,120
Grab the mane with one hand

593
00:35:17,600 --> 00:35:18,950
Block its movements

594
00:35:18,950 --> 00:35:19,710
One headbutt

595
00:35:20,130 --> 00:35:21,070
After feeling its resistance weakened

596
00:35:24,210 --> 00:35:25,070
Make love！

597
00:35:27,860 --> 00:35:29,020
A scary sound

598
00:35:31,620 --> 00:35:33,280
It's over really fast!

599
00:35:33,930 --> 00:35:35,580
Incidentally

600
00:35:35,580 --> 00:35:37,110
The last group, DobuRock

601
00:35:37,110 --> 00:35:38,660
Due to the content

602
00:35:38,660 --> 00:35:41,530
I don't know if it can be broadcast

603
00:35:41,530 --> 00:35:44,120
So you can't vote for them

604
00:35:44,130 --> 00:35:46,170
I see, its not in there

605
00:35:46,170 --> 00:35:52,440
Yes, the staff just wanted you to see it

606
00:35:52,440 --> 00:35:55,590
That's right, that sketch is a big problem

607
00:35:55,590 --> 00:35:56,330
I see

608
00:35:56,330 --> 00:35:58,480
Yes, so it can't be broadcast

609
00:35:58,480 --> 00:36:00,130
That's XXXX!

610
00:36:01,930 --> 00:36:07,140
So please vote for group E

611
00:36:09,920 --> 00:36:12,430
Almost done?

612
00:36:12,430 --> 00:36:14,440
So, please publish the results together

613
00:36:15,820 --> 00:36:20,980
Ah, Chance got three votes

614
00:36:20,980 --> 00:36:22,030
Jinnai, you chose Robert?

615
00:36:22,030 --> 00:36:27,700
I really want to continue to see Robert

616
00:36:27,700 --> 00:36:29,330
I see

617
00:36:29,330 --> 00:36:31,530
Ijiin you went with Chance

618
00:36:31,900 --> 00:36:37,140
I think his personal aura is enough to last for 30 seconds

619
00:36:37,140 --> 00:36:38,840
He also brought a good sketch

620
00:36:39,310 --> 00:36:40,830
Matsumoto, you also chose him

621
00:36:40,830 --> 00:36:43,160
Yes I did

622
00:36:43,160 --> 00:36:47,260
If the dog was dirty and looked like it had a disease, the effect might be better

623
00:36:47,260 --> 00:36:48,430
The dog was a bit too clean

624
00:36:48,430 --> 00:36:50,250
A little clean.
-Yes, it is

625
00:36:50,620 --> 00:36:51,570
What do you think, Baka?

626
00:36:51,570 --> 00:36:53,430
Chance is very interesting

627
00:36:53,430 --> 00:36:59,030
I don't know what to think of it but its still good

628
00:36:59,030 --> 00:37:00,040
Ok

629
00:37:00,040 --> 00:37:05,000
The winner of group E is Chance!

630
00:37:08,560 --> 00:37:13,850
So, these five progress from the group stages

631
00:37:13,850 --> 00:37:17,210
Who will win overall?

632
00:37:31,810 --> 00:37:34,240
These are the finalists

633
00:37:34,690 --> 00:37:36,560
What do you think?

634
00:37:36,560 --> 00:37:38,250
Very impressive

635
00:37:38,920 --> 00:37:41,750
Everyone who got through are strong figures
-Indeed

636
00:37:41,750 --> 00:37:44,740
Impressive that Inu can be with the others, right?
-Really is

637
00:37:45,730 --> 00:37:48,660
Now that I look at it, I think Iwahashi was the wrong choice

638
00:37:50,410 --> 00:37:52,540
It is true that Iwahashi stands out among these people

639
00:37:53,740 --> 00:37:55,130
That is the case

640
00:37:55,130 --> 00:37:56,260
After all, we don't know who we will choose after

641
00:37:58,720 --> 00:38:01,870
But, either way, he's the finalist of group a you selected

642
00:38:01,870 --> 00:38:05,630
Okay, now it's finally time for the final!

643
00:38:06,240 --> 00:38:08,930
First, the finalist of the first group is

644
00:38:09,440 --> 00:38:11,640
PlusMinus' Iwahashi

645
00:38:12,670 --> 00:38:14,640
Breaking a clarinet

646
00:38:14,640 --> 00:38:17,790
My favorite clarinet

647
00:38:17,790 --> 00:38:21,030
A clarinet handed down from my father

648
00:38:21,030 --> 00:38:24,090
Knowing that it is very important

649
00:38:24,090 --> 00:38:27,360
It's messed up, it doesn't make a sound

650
00:38:27,360 --> 00:38:30,520
What to do, what to do?

651
00:38:39,330 --> 00:38:40,430
Really shouldn't have chose him

652
00:38:42,200 --> 00:38:44,800
He should not have been chosen.
-Very true

653
00:38:44,800 --> 00:38:46,770
I made a mistake.
-It was a mistake

654
00:38:45,410 --> 00:38:48,330
Next is

655
00:38:49,240 --> 00:38:50,110
Inu

656
00:38:51,510 --> 00:38:53,160
Short sketch: Gym

657
00:38:53,540 --> 00:38:55,230
Let's do a few sets for the abs first

658
00:38:55,230 --> 00:38:56,400
I don't know if I can finish it

659
00:38:56,400 --> 00:38:57,770
It's time to start!

660
00:38:57,770 --> 00:38:59,210
One!
-Uhhhhh...

661
00:38:59,210 --> 00:39:00,240
You can do it!

662
00:39:00,240 --> 00:39:01,180
I can't do it

663
00:39:01,720 --> 00:39:02,640
I can't do it!

664
00:39:03,180 --> 00:39:04,920
How can I do it?

665
00:39:04,920 --> 00:39:07,940
Your arms are open, if you close them, it will be easier

666
00:39:07,940 --> 00:39:08,900
What's the position?

667
00:39:08,900 --> 00:39:10,700
You see your armpits are open

668
00:39:10,700 --> 00:39:12,130
Just a bit more...

669
00:39:12,130 --> 00:39:13,730
Oh oh, it worked!

670
00:39:14,020 --> 00:39:15,840
Success...

671
00:39:19,940 --> 00:39:21,040
What the hell?

672
00:39:21,620 --> 00:39:24,660
Next is

673
00:39:25,330 --> 00:39:26,450
Jeradon

674
00:39:27,560 --> 00:39:29,380
You're a tough talker

675
00:39:29,840 --> 00:39:31,030
But there's no way out

676
00:39:31,430 --> 00:39:33,360
Come out, Ibiru!

677
00:39:35,390 --> 00:39:36,780
What the hell is this guy?

678
00:39:37,100 --> 00:39:39,840
Is it time for dinner?
-Wha?

679
00:39:39,840 --> 00:39:41,610
I'll leave it to you, Ibiru

680
00:39:43,400 --> 00:39:46,530
I'm starting
-No!

681
00:39:46,940 --> 00:39:47,750
Are you okay?

682
00:39:48,550 --> 00:39:49,260
Eh?

683
00:39:49,260 --> 00:39:52,480
I'm actualy an FBI agent

684
00:39:52,480 --> 00:39:54,330
Isn't this too complicated?

685
00:40:00,210 --> 00:40:03,420
Next is

686
00:40:03,420 --> 00:40:05,120
President of Japan

687
00:40:26,860 --> 00:40:27,740
Towel

688
00:40:33,000 --> 00:40:34,040
Surprisingly, went for the head

689
00:40:39,840 --> 00:40:42,740
Fifth is

690
00:40:43,420 --> 00:40:44,910
Chance Oshiro

691
00:40:45,880 --> 00:40:47,440
The Terminator

692
00:41:08,060 --> 00:41:10,000
I am Taro Aso

693
00:41:12,820 --> 00:41:14,120
Are you kidding me?

694
00:41:14,990 --> 00:41:16,050
He's joking around

695
00:41:16,050 --> 00:41:18,120
It's over. It's over

696
00:41:18,450 --> 00:41:20,370
You guys picked them all

697
00:41:20,370 --> 00:41:21,290
These guys...

698
00:41:21,290 --> 00:41:23,640
I didn't know it'd turn out like this

699
00:41:24,430 --> 00:41:25,600
First of all, Iwahashi was really not the right choice

700
00:41:28,800 --> 00:41:31,220
So please, everyone...
-Wait a second

701
00:41:31,220 --> 00:41:32,350
This is the final, right?

702
00:41:32,350 --> 00:41:34,400
It's the final, right?
-Yes, it is

703
00:41:34,940 --> 00:41:37,510
I really want to choose again

704
00:41:37,510 --> 00:41:38,770
Want to change the group

705
00:41:38,770 --> 00:41:39,920
It would be nice to be able to start over from A

706
00:41:42,980 --> 00:41:46,220
So, finally the first 30-1 champion is about to be decided

707
00:41:46,220 --> 00:41:47,970
It's too hard.
-Please take your time to think about it

708
00:41:47,970 --> 00:41:49,480
Okay please write down your choice

709
00:41:50,480 --> 00:41:53,270
It's too hard to choose...

710
00:41:54,610 --> 00:41:57,450
What will be the result?

711
00:42:00,300 --> 00:42:02,480
So let's start announcing

712
00:42:02,480 --> 00:42:05,620
The final selection, please show all together!

713
00:42:07,070 --> 00:42:08,860
President of Japan

714
00:42:08,860 --> 00:42:09,770
Inu

715
00:42:09,770 --> 00:42:14,430
So, the winner of the first 30-1 Grand Prix is

716
00:42:14,430 --> 00:42:17,670
President of Japan!

717
00:42:20,990 --> 00:42:22,800
Matsumoto, you chose President of Japan

718
00:42:22,800 --> 00:42:24,860
I considered comprehensively

719
00:42:24,860 --> 00:42:27,730
From the overall viewpoint, I chose based on an overall assessment

720
00:42:27,730 --> 00:42:30,180
President of Japan came first
-So that's how it is

721
00:42:30,180 --> 00:42:32,260
Well, they were very bold

722
00:42:32,260 --> 00:42:33,540
Jinnai, you chose the same?

723
00:42:33,540 --> 00:42:36,270
President of Japan in 30 seconds is really interesting

724
00:42:36,270 --> 00:42:37,670
Their choice of focus is also interesting

725
00:42:37,670 --> 00:42:38,430
Baka, you also chose President of Japan

726
00:42:38,430 --> 00:42:42,360
Yes, they also chose a different type of segment for the second one than the first

727
00:42:42,360 --> 00:42:43,730
This point is also worthy of evaluation

728
00:42:43,730 --> 00:42:45,090
Ijiin you though Inu should be the winner

729
00:42:45,450 --> 00:42:48,880
Yes, originally

730
00:42:48,880 --> 00:42:53,450
I thought it'd be between Iwahashi and Oshiro

731
00:42:53,450 --> 00:42:55,920
I didn't expect them to fall off so quickly...

732
00:42:57,770 --> 00:43:02,480
But both were good at using the last 5 seconds of time

733
00:43:02,480 --> 00:43:05,150
This sense of atmosphere is very cleverly rendered

734
00:43:05,150 --> 00:43:06,560
So I think it is very good

735
00:43:06,560 --> 00:43:07,630
Coo you chose Inu too

736
00:43:07,630 --> 00:43:11,370
Yes, but I was also thinking about President of Japan

737
00:43:11,370 --> 00:43:16,020
Inu's good at making you guess what'll happen

738
00:43:16,020 --> 00:43:18,180
But Oshiro is too weird, right?

739
00:43:18,850 --> 00:43:21,620
Who would end with a parody of Aso Taro?

740
00:43:21,620 --> 00:43:23,020
Too weird

741
00:43:23,020 --> 00:43:24,570
Yes, there are obviously many other options

742
00:43:24,570 --> 00:43:27,480
The last thing he did was to reference Aso Taro. Who would do such a thing?

743
00:43:27,480 --> 00:43:28,850
Wrapped up like that

744
00:43:28,850 --> 00:43:33,190
Now I'm annoyed for having said a dirty dog toy would've been better

745
00:43:34,590 --> 00:43:37,380
This is not a problem at all

746
00:43:37,860 --> 00:43:39,170
Who cares if it's dirty or not!

747
00:43:39,170 --> 00:43:41,930
How do you feel after the competition, Baka?

748
00:43:41,930 --> 00:43:45,120
I really think this competition is very good

749
00:43:45,120 --> 00:43:49,740
Lots of people will reflect afterwards due to it being the first time

750
00:43:50,260 --> 00:43:51,940
They'll understand a lot more

751
00:43:51,940 --> 00:43:55,790
There must be a lot that weren't broadcast, right?
-Yes

752
00:43:55,790 --> 00:43:56,950
Oh, that's true

753
00:43:56,950 --> 00:43:58,050
There are 35 groups that did not air

754
00:43:58,050 --> 00:44:01,120
Then the possibility that many interesting ones weren't shown
-Indeed

755
00:44:01,120 --> 00:44:05,330
Is it possible to see one we didn't watch?
-Yeah

756
00:44:05,330 --> 00:44:07,850
Don't you want to see it? Raichou...

757
00:44:07,850 --> 00:44:09,690
Forget Raichou!

758
00:44:09,860 --> 00:44:11,120
This is the last group you want to see, right?

759
00:44:11,120 --> 00:44:12,420
The second skit of Raichou?

760
00:44:19,160 --> 00:44:21,470
Good morning
-Good morning

761
00:44:24,810 --> 00:44:26,080
Huh?

762
00:44:26,610 --> 00:44:28,180
What?

763
00:44:28,810 --> 00:44:29,880
What?

764
00:44:29,880 --> 00:44:31,410
What?

765
00:44:32,850 --> 00:44:35,480
Isn't this 300,000?.
-A scam, right?

766
00:44:35,480 --> 00:44:37,120
What the hell?
-Congratulations

767
00:44:37,120 --> 00:44:39,220
Congratulations?

768
00:44:40,260 --> 00:44:42,660
Eh, what're we getting paid for?

769
00:44:44,190 --> 00:44:47,500
Isn't there anything to do with the number 30?
-30?

770
00:44:48,600 --> 00:44:50,170
30...

771
00:44:50,170 --> 00:44:51,900
Eh, do you know what it is?

772
00:44:51,900 --> 00:44:53,540
I might know.
-What is it?

773
00:44:53,540 --> 00:44:55,840
I really don't know anything to do with the number 30

774
00:44:55,840 --> 00:44:57,310
Isn't it that one?

775
00:44:57,310 --> 00:44:59,540
Eh, is it okay for me to say it?

776
00:44:59,540 --> 00:45:01,580
Is it Wednesday Downtown?

777
00:45:01,580 --> 00:45:02,880
Yes!
-Oh-oh!

778
00:45:02,880 --> 00:45:05,510
30-second segment
-Oh really?

779
00:45:05,510 --> 00:45:07,320
Eh, so the result is... right?

780
00:45:07,320 --> 00:45:10,050
Congratulations, you won the 30-1 Grand Prix

781
00:45:10,050 --> 00:45:11,350
Eh!!!
-Awesome!

782
00:45:11,350 --> 00:45:12,590
It's a lie, right?

783
00:45:12,590 --> 00:45:14,490
Eh, we won, right?
-Yes

784
00:45:16,760 --> 00:45:18,960
And that's the prize money for the contest, right?
-Yes

785
00:45:20,630 --> 00:45:23,670
And it's our first time on Wednesday...

786
00:45:23,670 --> 00:45:25,470
Eh, it was actually a serious competition, huh?

787
00:45:25,470 --> 00:45:27,170
That was really a contest... huh?

788
00:45:27,170 --> 00:45:29,240
No, I just thought...

789
00:45:29,240 --> 00:45:31,510
Chance Oshiro did it too.
-Yes

790
00:45:31,510 --> 00:45:32,710
Something seems weird

791
00:45:32,720 --> 00:45:38,110
I thought we were invited to do something that was pranking him...

792
00:45:38,110 --> 00:45:39,050
No, it's not.
-Oh oh no ah

793
00:45:39,320 --> 00:45:43,390
We beter take Chance Oshiro out to dinner then

794
00:45:43,390 --> 00:46:29,800
