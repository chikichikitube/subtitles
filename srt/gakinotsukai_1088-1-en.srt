00:00:03,070 --> 00:00:06,950
Special talent demonstration meeting - let's raise our views!

3
00:00:11,660 --> 00:00:14,320
That's exactly what this will be about

4
00:00:12,120 --> 00:00:14,590
Downtown

Matsumoto Hitoshi

7
00:00:14,320 --> 00:00:16,960
Everything's ok as long as our views will increase

8
00:00:16,960 --> 00:00:19,500
Cocorico

9
00:00:16,960 --> 00:00:19,500

Fujiwara Kazuhiro

14
00:00:19,500 --> 00:00:21,570

License

16
00:00:19,790 --> 00:00:22,190
Is anything really gonna be ok?

17
00:00:22,190 --> 00:00:24,390
It's about our special skills
- I see

18
00:00:24,390 --> 00:00:27,810
I mean things we usually don't do on tv, as long as our views will increase

19
00:00:27,810 --> 00:00:29,210
This is something new

20
00:00:29,210 --> 00:00:31,510
As you can see, our regulars are on this side

21
00:00:31,510 --> 00:00:32,840
And we have guests here

22
00:00:32,840 --> 00:00:34,350

26
00:00:34,350 --> 00:00:36,780
Ameagari Kesshitai

Miyasako Hiroyuki

29
00:00:36,780 --> 00:00:40,250
Look how villainous his face has become
- Who? Fujimon?

30
00:00:40,750 --> 00:00:45,060
That's the face of a man who's thinking of money

31
00:00:43,450 --> 00:00:45,060
- I'm not

32
00:00:45,060 --> 00:00:50,090
I bet they'll show us a pair nude

33
00:00:51,490 --> 00:00:56,720
Tonight, our members will compete with
special skills they never showed on tv before

34
00:00:56,720 --> 00:01:03,800
Their objective is to show their skills succesfully
in order to make ratings per minute skyrocket!

45
00:01:30,190 --> 00:01:31,590
Here we go
- Alright

46
00:01:31,590 --> 00:01:32,590
Here's the first one

47
00:01:32,590 --> 00:01:35,130
Who will it be? The first round is important

48
00:01:36,460 --> 00:01:38,260
"Blowpipe while riding a ball"

49
00:01:38,260 --> 00:01:41,170
If they actually do this, people at home will watch it

50
00:01:41,170 --> 00:01:42,100
That's right

51
00:01:42,100 --> 00:01:45,340
They would stop zapping
- Of course they would

52
00:01:45,340 --> 00:01:46,670
Whose skill is this?

53
00:01:46,670 --> 00:01:47,540
Here!

54
00:01:47,540 --> 00:01:49,850
Really?
- Never heard of that

55
00:01:49,850 --> 00:01:53,520
I don't even think he has the lung capacity to shoot a dart...

56
00:01:53,950 --> 00:01:55,520
I do

57
00:01:55,520 --> 00:01:58,280
He's also the first one, so...
- That's right

58
00:01:58,280 --> 00:02:04,070
If he fails doing it, everyone would go watch Wowow instead

59
00:02:04,070 --> 00:02:05,940
Alright, head to the challenge room

60
00:02:05,940 --> 00:02:07,540
Alright, let me do it

61
00:02:07,540 --> 00:02:10,460
I want to see this
- Over there?

62
00:02:12,030 --> 00:02:13,360
Endo did you know this?

63
00:02:13,360 --> 00:02:14,410
No I didn't

64
00:02:14,410 --> 00:02:15,800
You don't?
- I don't

65
00:02:15,800 --> 00:02:19,340
We're aiming at top rates, so it's best if everyone could enjoy this

66
00:02:19,340 --> 00:02:22,140
So that even people not good at japanese...
- I see

67
00:02:22,140 --> 00:02:25,010
Can watch this and enjoy our show

68
00:02:25,290 --> 00:02:26,510
CHALLENGE ROOM - WARM UP

69
00:02:26,510 --> 00:02:29,680
Everyone's expectation is on our first challenger Tanaka

70
00:02:30,280 --> 00:02:34,390
Will he be able to do it properly
and make the viewers stick to their tv?

71
00:02:36,090 --> 00:02:38,590
Looks like Tanaka is ready now

72
00:02:38,590 --> 00:02:39,660
I want to see this

73
00:02:39,660 --> 00:02:41,020
Let's call him, Tanaka!

74
00:02:41,660 --> 00:02:43,330
Yes, here I am

75
00:02:43,330 --> 00:02:44,430
No way

76
00:02:44,430 --> 00:02:46,230
I'm ready for it
- Is he for real?

77
00:02:46,230 --> 00:02:48,730
I'll hop up on this

78
00:02:48,730 --> 00:02:52,470
And I'll walk for around 5 meters on it

79
00:02:49,860 --> 00:02:51,570
- No way he can do that

80
00:02:51,570 --> 00:02:52,470
- Yes

81
00:02:52,470 --> 00:02:54,470
Then, as you can see

82
00:02:54,470 --> 00:02:55,670
There's a balloon there

83
00:02:56,570 --> 00:02:58,910
It's 8 meters away from here

84
00:02:58,910 --> 00:03:01,220
This is impossible...
- And while I'm still on it

85
00:03:01,220 --> 00:03:03,220
I'll blow a dart and pop it

86
00:03:03,220 --> 00:03:04,220
Incredible

87
00:03:04,220 --> 00:03:06,580
That balloon is so small

88
00:03:06,580 --> 00:03:08,430
Even his dart is really small

89
00:03:08,430 --> 00:03:12,330
Let us know when you're ready, you think you can do it now?

90
00:03:12,660 --> 00:03:13,730
I'm ready

91
00:03:13,730 --> 00:03:14,860
It'd be great if he can

92
00:03:14,860 --> 00:03:18,630
Here's Tanaka's attempt to raise our ratings per minute!

93
00:03:19,030 --> 00:03:20,600
Just that
- It's in front of him

94
00:03:21,810 --> 00:03:23,700
RATINGS RAISE: START

95
00:03:23,700 --> 00:03:26,400
Can he really do it?

96
00:03:26,400 --> 00:03:29,400
Yeah I mean, what's this? It's hard to imagine

97
00:03:29,400 --> 00:03:31,400
It sounds freaky enough

98
00:03:33,000 --> 00:03:34,080
Are you kidding me?

99
00:03:35,190 --> 00:03:36,880
Looking good

100
00:03:36,880 --> 00:03:39,180
He's on it
- This will raise them for good

101
00:03:39,180 --> 00:03:41,550
He's really on it

102
00:03:42,320 --> 00:03:44,090
Keep on going, man!

103
00:03:44,090 --> 00:03:46,890
That's the type of thing people want to see

104
00:03:46,890 --> 00:03:49,090
Show us his face, that's the funniest part

105
00:03:49,090 --> 00:03:49,920
This isn't...

106
00:03:50,920 --> 00:03:52,730
A face you see everyday

107
00:03:52,730 --> 00:03:54,260
This is gonna be a hit

108
00:03:54,260 --> 00:03:55,660
Almost there!

109
00:03:55,660 --> 00:03:57,120
Now he must pop the balloon

110
00:03:57,120 --> 00:04:01,600
He completed the 5 meters, so now he must shoot the balloon

111
00:04:01,600 --> 00:04:02,110
How...?

112
00:04:02,110 --> 00:04:03,840
He has to face the other way

113
00:04:03,840 --> 00:04:06,170
He's changing direction for real!

114
00:04:07,470 --> 00:04:10,700
This is amazing!
- So good, it's incredible

115
00:04:10,700 --> 00:04:14,250
- He's so stable
- Looking good, keep on going!

116
00:04:14,250 --> 00:04:16,250
If he actually does it, it'd be so cool

117
00:04:16,250 --> 00:04:21,290
He's aiming at it
- It's not stable, is he gonna be ok?

118
00:04:21,290 --> 00:04:24,590
Is it ok?
- It's not really stable

119
00:04:34,690 --> 00:04:36,180
Incredible!

120
00:04:39,580 --> 00:04:40,770
Incredible!

121
00:04:40,770 --> 00:04:43,270
He did it!
- That was incredible!

122
00:04:45,770 --> 00:04:46,620
Alright

123
00:04:46,620 --> 00:04:49,070
Can you see our studio from here?

124
00:04:49,070 --> 00:04:50,260
I can
- You can

125
00:04:50,260 --> 00:04:55,160
You got a full standing ovation

126
00:04:56,800 --> 00:05:01,470
You think I got the ratings up with this?

127
00:04:59,640 --> 00:05:01,470
- I think you did

128
00:05:01,470 --> 00:05:03,610
I raised em up good, isn't it true?!

129
00:05:03,610 --> 00:05:04,760
Amazing

130
00:05:04,760 --> 00:05:08,170
Wait a second, what was that?
- That was impressive

131
00:05:09,070 --> 00:05:11,050
My partner is amazing
- What now?

132
00:05:11,050 --> 00:05:13,580
Are we expecting even better skills?
- That's the plan

133
00:05:13,580 --> 00:05:16,120
Endo just said something we all missed

134
00:05:16,320 --> 00:05:19,420
That made me think "I have such an amazing partner"...

135
00:05:21,320 --> 00:05:23,830
I bet you did
- It's been 20 years since our debut

136
00:05:23,830 --> 00:05:27,100
And that seriously made me think "I'm glad I paired up with him"

137
00:05:27,740 --> 00:05:28,700
He's back

138
00:05:29,500 --> 00:05:31,490
That was incredible

139
00:05:31,990 --> 00:05:34,090
Your face was kind of pale

140
00:05:34,090 --> 00:05:35,000
Yeah I know

141
00:05:35,000 --> 00:05:39,340
But the face he made while
riding the ball was hilarious

142
00:05:39,740 --> 00:05:42,170
Alright, let's keep this pace

143
00:05:42,170 --> 00:05:44,400
Here's our next special skill

144
00:05:45,840 --> 00:05:48,620
"Blast wave plastic bottle knock down"

145
00:05:48,620 --> 00:05:50,040
I don't know what that means

146
00:05:50,040 --> 00:05:51,280
I know, right?

147
00:05:51,280 --> 00:05:52,350
Who's this?

148
00:05:52,350 --> 00:05:53,310
That's me

149
00:05:53,310 --> 00:05:54,240
Fujimon?

150
00:05:54,240 --> 00:05:54,990
Yes

151
00:05:55,160 --> 00:05:57,090
What does it even mean?

152
00:05:57,090 --> 00:05:59,760
When I was a student, I used to do athletics

153
00:05:59,760 --> 00:06:02,730
So I have an impressive lung capacity

154
00:06:02,730 --> 00:06:06,230
So much that I can easily knock down a 500 ml water bottle

155
00:06:06,230 --> 00:06:08,900
By only using my breath

156
00:06:08,900 --> 00:06:11,630
So you can do this because of the track team?

157
00:06:11,630 --> 00:06:13,240
Yeah but my lungs...

158
00:06:13,240 --> 00:06:16,240
Doesn't that mean everyone from the track club could do it?

159
00:06:16,240 --> 00:06:20,380
Probably, but still I'm a monster when it comes to lung capacity

160
00:06:20,380 --> 00:06:24,050
I mean, he's right after Tanaka's great success...

161
00:06:24,050 --> 00:06:25,850
I'll build a nice flow to this

162
00:06:25,850 --> 00:06:27,220
I'm gonna keep it high

163
00:06:27,220 --> 00:06:29,050
Ok then, head to the challenge room!

164
00:06:31,910 --> 00:06:33,910
We're counting on you

165
00:06:35,320 --> 00:06:36,100
About this...

166
00:06:36,100 --> 00:06:37,960
This didn't seem much to me

167
00:06:37,960 --> 00:06:40,470
But the more I think about it...

168
00:06:41,530 --> 00:06:42,470
It's impossible

169
00:06:42,470 --> 00:06:45,000
Matsumoto, try it out for a second

170
00:06:45,000 --> 00:06:45,800
- It's impossible...

171
00:06:45,800 --> 00:06:48,800
It's so round--- is he gonna use this?

172
00:06:48,800 --> 00:06:52,440
With this, right?
- It's so round, air would flow sideways

173
00:06:54,370 --> 00:06:58,750
It didn't even budge!
- It's impossible!

174
00:06:58,750 --> 00:06:59,940
Try it, Miyasako

175
00:07:03,540 --> 00:07:05,010
I told you

176
00:07:05,010 --> 00:07:05,960
Of course

177
00:07:05,960 --> 00:07:08,160
This is absolutely impossible!

178
00:07:08,160 --> 00:07:11,030
CHALLENGE ROOM - WARM UP

179
00:07:11,030 --> 00:07:12,430
Will it go well?

180
00:07:13,860 --> 00:07:17,430
An under-pressure Fujimoto
will try his best to raise the ratings

181
00:07:17,430 --> 00:07:18,760
Can he do it?

182
00:07:19,390 --> 00:07:22,600
Looks like he's ready, so let's call him out: Fujimon!

183
00:07:22,960 --> 00:07:23,400
Yes

184
00:07:23,400 --> 00:07:25,740
Those are huge!

185
00:07:26,140 --> 00:07:28,840
Are you going to knock down 3 of them?
- All of them, yes

186
00:07:30,500 --> 00:07:34,140
You should show them to us so we know there are no tricks

187
00:07:34,140 --> 00:07:35,440
Like, try to lift em
- Ok

188
00:07:35,440 --> 00:07:38,250
They're full of water
- Yes, as you can see

189
00:07:38,250 --> 00:07:40,150
See? They're full of it

190
00:07:40,150 --> 00:07:41,450
It's true

191
00:07:41,550 --> 00:07:42,850
Incredible

192
00:07:43,320 --> 00:07:44,250
Ready, Fujimon?

193
00:07:44,250 --> 00:07:45,750
Yes, I'm ok

194
00:07:45,750 --> 00:07:49,090
Here goes Fujimon's views-raise attempt!

195
00:07:52,370 --> 00:07:53,790
VIEWS-RAISE: START

196
00:07:53,790 --> 00:07:55,490
Is he for real?

197
00:07:55,490 --> 00:07:56,730
From that angle?

198
00:07:58,730 --> 00:08:00,670
This already seems good

199
00:08:00,670 --> 00:08:03,170
No way they're gonna fall...

200
00:08:08,140 --> 00:08:09,410
Alright!

201
00:08:10,640 --> 00:08:11,710
How was it?

202
00:08:12,140 --> 00:08:14,080
Incredible

203
00:08:14,480 --> 00:08:15,990
Amazing

204
00:08:15,990 --> 00:08:19,430
He's getting dizzy

205
00:08:19,430 --> 00:08:20,250
That was good

206
00:08:20,250 --> 00:08:22,350
First head back here, then you talk

207
00:08:22,350 --> 00:08:24,620
Yes, I'm not in the best shape right now

208
00:08:24,620 --> 00:08:26,970
Come back here first
- Yes

209
00:08:27,340 --> 00:08:31,640
The pressure is getting harsher and harsher...

210
00:08:31,910 --> 00:08:34,240
I'm sure our views are skyrocketing like crazy

211
00:08:34,600 --> 00:08:36,470
Yeah I can feel it

212
00:08:36,470 --> 00:08:37,600
Oh, he's back

213
00:08:37,900 --> 00:08:38,760
How was it?

214
00:08:38,760 --> 00:08:40,240
It was amazing

215
00:08:40,710 --> 00:08:41,870
Incredible

216
00:08:43,650 --> 00:08:44,480
That was great

217
00:08:44,480 --> 00:08:45,020
Thanks

218
00:08:45,020 --> 00:08:46,420
Are you dizzy?

219
00:08:46,420 --> 00:08:48,090
Yeah it really made me dizzy

220
00:08:48,090 --> 00:08:49,780
Of course it does

221
00:08:49,780 --> 00:08:50,820
Did the views raise?

222
00:08:50,820 --> 00:08:52,970
I really think they did

223
00:08:52,970 --> 00:08:55,850
It'd be so cool if we could do them all

224
00:08:55,850 --> 00:08:58,890
Let's work hard and raise em up good

225
00:08:58,890 --> 00:09:00,570
Here's our next special skill

226
00:09:00,570 --> 00:09:02,290
I'm starting to enjoy this

227
00:09:03,390 --> 00:09:05,660
"Free kick water bottle knock down"

228
00:09:06,160 --> 00:09:07,200
Who's this?

229
00:09:07,200 --> 00:09:07,630
It's me

230
00:09:07,630 --> 00:09:09,920
Oh, is it Inomoto?

231
00:09:09,920 --> 00:09:10,370
Yes

232
00:09:10,470 --> 00:09:11,370
Free kicks?

233
00:09:11,740 --> 00:09:17,580
I'll set some water bottles 10 meters away from me

234
00:09:15,010 --> 00:09:16,970
- From 10 meters?

235
00:09:17,580 --> 00:09:20,590
And I'll hit it in one shot

236
00:09:20,680 --> 00:09:22,950
Ten meters?!

237
00:09:23,250 --> 00:09:25,430
I'll hit them clean
- Really? Can you do it?

238
00:09:25,430 --> 00:09:27,430
Alright, head to the challenge room

239
00:09:27,430 --> 00:09:28,250
Countin' on you

240
00:09:28,750 --> 00:09:30,250
It sounds incredible

241
00:09:30,850 --> 00:09:31,760
It does

242
00:09:31,800 --> 00:09:33,800
CHALLENGE ROOM - WARM UP

243
00:09:32,000 --> 00:09:33,800
Can I kick one of them now?

244
00:09:34,490 --> 00:09:39,530
Inomoto, our talented contestant who even
made it to national competitions during highschool

245
00:09:39,530 --> 00:09:42,700
Will he be able to kick away this piling up pressure?

246
00:09:43,770 --> 00:09:44,930
Looks like he's ready

247
00:09:45,570 --> 00:09:46,140
Here we go

248
00:09:46,140 --> 00:09:47,410
Inomoto?
- Yes

249
00:09:48,410 --> 00:09:49,410
He was right

250
00:09:49,410 --> 00:09:50,840
Is this for real?

251
00:09:50,840 --> 00:09:52,510
This looks so hard

252
00:09:52,510 --> 00:09:55,250
Are you for real, Inomoto?
- This is impossible

253
00:09:55,250 --> 00:09:58,460
You weren't joking around, weren't you?

254
00:09:58,760 --> 00:10:01,400
Here I go
- Already?!

255
00:10:01,400 --> 00:10:03,020
Are you for real?

256
00:10:03,020 --> 00:10:04,220
You sure you're ready?

257
00:10:04,220 --> 00:10:05,150
I'm ready

258
00:10:05,820 --> 00:10:06,720
Let's start then

259
00:10:06,620 --> 00:10:08,020
- He's so confident

260
00:10:07,420 --> 00:10:10,630
Here's Inomoto attempt to increase our views!

261
00:10:10,630 --> 00:10:11,530
I'm excited

262
00:10:12,030 --> 00:10:13,300
Is he for real?

263
00:10:13,300 --> 00:10:14,460
This is exciting

264
00:10:14,460 --> 00:10:16,410
VIEWS-RAISE: START

265
00:10:17,410 --> 00:10:18,410
In one shot, he said

266
00:10:22,690 --> 00:10:35,320
[repeating from before]

267
00:10:35,620 --> 00:10:36,420
He's gonna fail

268
00:10:39,790 --> 00:10:41,090
That was not even close

269
00:10:41,490 --> 00:10:42,760
Come on...

270
00:10:42,760 --> 00:10:44,460
It went way over it

271
00:10:46,460 --> 00:10:48,210
What are we gonna do with this?

272
00:10:48,210 --> 00:10:50,610
I played soccer too back then, can I say a word about this?

273
00:10:50,610 --> 00:10:53,140
That guy sucks at soccer!

274
00:10:53,910 --> 00:10:56,080
\ Wait a moment, please /

275
00:10:56,080 --> 00:10:58,120
I swear I can do it!

276
00:10:58,340 --> 00:11:00,120
But you didn't do it

277
00:11:00,120 --> 00:11:03,950
I brought a VTR with me, just in case

278
00:11:03,950 --> 00:11:07,620
How about we take a look at it together?

279
00:11:07,620 --> 00:11:09,590
The VTR is even greater than this

280
00:11:09,990 --> 00:11:11,960
Just take a look at it, please!

281
00:11:12,690 --> 00:11:14,600
Of course he's gonna make it

282
00:11:14,600 --> 00:11:16,330
He's sweating so much!

283
00:11:16,330 --> 00:11:18,190
He sure have practiced this

284
00:11:18,660 --> 00:11:19,190
See?

285
00:11:19,190 --> 00:11:20,830
Oh, they're in succession

286
00:11:21,830 --> 00:11:22,740
He did knock it down

287
00:11:22,740 --> 00:11:23,830
He's going for them all?

288
00:11:23,830 --> 00:11:25,500
Really?
- So bold

289
00:11:26,700 --> 00:11:27,800
He seems relaxed

290
00:11:29,500 --> 00:11:32,410
Two in a row is pretty impressive---

291
00:11:32,410 --> 00:11:33,210
Eh?!

292
00:11:33,210 --> 00:11:34,670
Are you kidding me?
- Three?!

293
00:11:34,670 --> 00:11:35,610
No way

294
00:11:41,360 --> 00:11:43,530
Be honest: how many attempts did it take?

295
00:11:43,530 --> 00:11:45,590
I don't know the exact number

296
00:11:45,590 --> 00:11:47,500
But it took me 1 hour and half

297
00:11:47,500 --> 00:11:49,990
Man that's a long time!
- 1 hour and half?

298
00:11:50,760 --> 00:11:52,190
What do you think, Fujiwara?

299
00:11:52,390 --> 00:11:53,790
I mean, it's amazing

300
00:11:53,790 --> 00:11:54,940
Can't argue with that

301
00:11:54,940 --> 00:11:58,840
He wasn't as nervous as the previous ones too...

302
00:11:59,380 --> 00:12:02,110
But he set up that "just kidding" thing
- Yeah, he failed

303
00:12:02,290 --> 00:12:05,050
I bet some are thinking "that was too carefree", right?

304
00:12:05,050 --> 00:12:07,850
I'm outraged, I feel like he's messing around with us

305
00:12:08,020 --> 00:12:10,420
We should tell him like "don't lie to us"!

306
00:12:10,420 --> 00:12:11,790
I won't forgive him for this

307
00:12:11,790 --> 00:12:13,890
By the time he failed it was already surreal

308
00:12:13,890 --> 00:12:16,460
Shut up, Miyasako!

309
00:12:20,050 --> 00:12:23,850
Our fourth skill is "100% full score singing at karaoke"

310
00:12:23,850 --> 00:12:25,190
Who's this?

311
00:12:25,890 --> 00:12:26,390
Here!

312
00:12:26,390 --> 00:12:28,070
What the hell!
- It's impossible

313
00:12:28,070 --> 00:12:31,110
Isn't this like they used to do a lot on tv?

314
00:12:31,310 --> 00:12:34,770
We'll have a full score without having the actual singer doing it

315
00:12:34,770 --> 00:12:36,700
I, Endo Shozo, will do it in one shot

316
00:12:36,970 --> 00:12:38,540
Are you kidding me?

317
00:12:38,540 --> 00:12:39,790
No way, it's impossible

318
00:12:39,790 --> 00:12:41,000
Which song, by the way?

319
00:12:41,150 --> 00:12:45,750
"you're the one who rang the bell"

320
00:12:41,150 --> 00:12:45,750
Wada Akiko's masterpiece "ano kane wo narasu no wa anata"

321
00:12:46,110 --> 00:12:47,240
You know

322
00:12:47,240 --> 00:12:49,580
If you fail this, Akiko will be involved too

323
00:12:49,580 --> 00:12:52,120
You may hurt her pride

324
00:12:51,180 --> 00:12:52,120
- You're right

325
00:12:52,120 --> 00:12:52,730
So

326
00:12:52,730 --> 00:12:55,730
You'll be officially scolded by her

327
00:12:55,730 --> 00:12:58,050
"Officially"?
- That's right

328
00:12:58,350 --> 00:13:00,050
Head to the challenge room

329
00:13:00,050 --> 00:13:01,420
Here I go
- Go

330
00:13:01,680 --> 00:13:02,890
I hope he can make it

331
00:13:03,130 --> 00:13:04,340
I never saw him doing it

332
00:13:04,340 --> 00:13:07,040
Is Endo really that good at singing it?

333
00:13:07,040 --> 00:13:10,780
I can confirm that he once scored 100 points singing it

334
00:13:10,040 --> 00:13:11,140
Really?
- You saw him?

335
00:13:11,140 --> 00:13:17,010
But he also scored around 90 or so with it, so getting it at his first attempt...

336
00:13:17,010 --> 00:13:18,410
It's not accurate

337
00:13:18,410 --> 00:13:20,840
Space Battleship Yamato

338
00:13:18,410 --> 00:13:20,840
When I scored 100 with Uchuu Senkan Yamato's OP

339
00:13:20,840 --> 00:13:25,010
I was like "goodbye, oh Earth"

340
00:13:25,010 --> 00:13:26,160
Like, emotionless

341
00:13:26,160 --> 00:13:28,390
Too much modulation won't get you points

342
00:13:28,590 --> 00:13:29,350
CHALLENGE ROOM - WARM UP

343
00:13:29,350 --> 00:13:32,690
As the general enthusiasm dampens, Endo is ready for his attempt

344
00:13:34,090 --> 00:13:38,260
Will he be able to ring the full-score bell?

345
00:13:39,690 --> 00:13:42,760
Looks like he's ready

346
00:13:42,760 --> 00:13:43,630
Endo!

347
00:13:44,330 --> 00:13:46,440
He's into it
- He's so focused

348
00:13:46,440 --> 00:13:47,810
Endo
- Yes?

349
00:13:47,810 --> 00:13:50,280
Your face has become... weird

350
00:13:50,980 --> 00:13:52,280
That's an "I'm gonna lose" face

351
00:13:52,280 --> 00:13:53,910
That's the face you're giving us?

352
00:13:53,910 --> 00:13:55,310
What are you looking at?

353
00:13:55,880 --> 00:13:57,310
Are you okay?

354
00:13:57,310 --> 00:13:59,150
I'm ok, I have confidence

355
00:13:59,150 --> 00:14:03,020
Let's go then, here's Endo's attempt to raise our views!

356
00:14:04,540 --> 00:14:05,490
Really?

357
00:14:06,650 --> 00:14:07,790
VIEWS-RAISE: START

358
00:14:07,790 --> 00:14:10,340
The beginning is important

359
00:14:10,340 --> 00:14:15,540
♪ YOU'RE THE ONE WHO RANG THE BELL

360
00:14:19,040 --> 00:14:27,850
I'm so glad I could meet you

361
00:14:23,270 --> 00:14:24,570
He looks ready

362
00:14:27,850 --> 00:14:37,430
You have the same scent as hope

363
00:14:37,430 --> 00:14:42,430
Even if I'd trip and get hurt

364
00:14:42,430 --> 00:14:47,340
And even if I'd cry

365
00:14:44,140 --> 00:14:46,230
Is that his best?

366
00:14:46,230 --> 00:14:48,960
He's putting his all in this

367
00:14:47,340 --> 00:14:55,850
You'd still have that refreshing scent of hope

368
00:14:48,960 --> 00:14:51,230
But it's different from
the original song

369
00:14:55,850 --> 00:15:04,790
The town is now asleep

370
00:15:04,790 --> 00:15:14,330
And you're the one who rang the bell

371
00:15:05,810 --> 00:15:07,280
He just made a mistake

372
00:15:12,740 --> 00:15:14,550
He got that wrong!

373
00:15:14,330 --> 00:15:22,870
While everyone is lonely

374
00:15:15,690 --> 00:15:18,950
He sang that as if
it was the last part

375
00:15:22,870 --> 00:15:35,720
You're the one who rang the bell

376
00:15:27,260 --> 00:15:29,570
There are some mistakes

377
00:15:30,970 --> 00:15:31,570
Here goes

378
00:15:32,770 --> 00:15:34,940
Yes, yes, that one
was good

379
00:15:36,220 --> 00:15:39,220
Wasn't that just now a big mistake?

380
00:15:40,320 --> 00:15:42,320
Why all these mistakes?

381
00:15:42,320 --> 00:15:43,920
Man...

382
00:15:43,920 --> 00:15:48,390
How was it?
- How much did he score?

383
00:15:48,690 --> 00:15:49,450
Come on

384
00:15:50,550 --> 00:15:52,280
Wait for it...

385
00:15:53,980 --> 00:15:54,680
Here it is

386
00:15:54,680 --> 00:15:57,630
Yes yes
- How much is it?

387
00:15:57,630 --> 00:16:00,030
"WELL, NOTHING UNLISTENABLE"

388
00:16:00,030 --> 00:16:01,100
89 points?

389
00:16:03,100 --> 00:16:04,230
Are you kidding me?

390
00:16:04,740 --> 00:16:07,600
He didn't even score 90

391
00:16:07,940 --> 00:16:09,340
I'm really...

392
00:16:10,540 --> 00:16:11,340
Sorry for this

393
00:16:11,340 --> 00:16:12,310
That much?

394
00:16:12,310 --> 00:16:13,940
Well, he did what he did

395
00:16:13,940 --> 00:16:15,940
He's not coming back here

396
00:16:16,440 --> 00:16:18,720
You knew it dude

397
00:16:19,640 --> 00:16:20,690
Is he for real?

398
00:16:20,690 --> 00:16:22,160
He's laughing

399
00:16:22,160 --> 00:16:24,060
The hell are ya laughin' at?!

400
00:16:24,060 --> 00:16:25,820
I'm not laughing at all

401
00:16:25,820 --> 00:16:28,720
You're definitely laughing

402
00:16:28,720 --> 00:16:31,130
Just come back here

403
00:16:31,730 --> 00:16:33,130
Was it 90 points?

404
00:16:33,130 --> 00:16:34,830
Oh no, 89
- 89, yes

405
00:16:34,830 --> 00:16:36,580
He didn't reach 90 points

406
00:16:36,580 --> 00:16:38,340
That's an average score

407
00:16:38,340 --> 00:16:41,180
I think everyone over 40 can score that

408
00:16:41,770 --> 00:16:43,180
Over 40?

409
00:16:44,810 --> 00:16:46,180
No way

410
00:16:47,480 --> 00:16:49,690
CHALLENGE OVER

411
00:16:49,690 --> 00:16:54,060
Why couldn't I score at least 90 points...?

412
00:16:55,150 --> 00:16:58,490
As the pressure becomes more intense, they reveal the fifth secret skill

413
00:16:59,220 --> 00:17:00,030
Who's this?

414
00:17:00,030 --> 00:17:02,030
"Perfect nunchaku"

415
00:17:02,030 --> 00:17:03,330
Who's this?

416
00:17:03,330 --> 00:17:04,760
I don't get this, who is it?

417
00:17:04,760 --> 00:17:06,140
Who's this person now...

418
00:17:06,390 --> 00:17:07,360
It's me

419
00:17:07,860 --> 00:17:08,970
Can you do it?

420
00:17:08,970 --> 00:17:13,910
The first birthday present I ever got from my dad was a toy nunchaku

421
00:17:13,430 --> 00:17:13,910
- I see

422
00:17:13,910 --> 00:17:17,350
So I'm extremely confident in my nunchaku skills

423
00:17:17,610 --> 00:17:18,050
Basically

424
00:17:18,050 --> 00:17:25,190
If I'm holding a nunchaku, I can knock down everything you throw at me

425
00:17:22,920 --> 00:17:25,190
- That's impossible     - That's bullshit

426
00:17:25,190 --> 00:17:28,230
I mean, I like Bruce Lee a lot

427
00:17:27,090 --> 00:17:28,230
- Yeah but...

428
00:17:28,230 --> 00:17:31,130
Have you ever tried doing that with a nunchaku?

429
00:17:31,130 --> 00:17:34,230
You know our viewers are expecting a lot from this

430
00:17:34,230 --> 00:17:35,770
Yeah but have you done it before?

431
00:17:35,770 --> 00:17:38,200
Have you ever done it before? Huh?

432
00:17:38,700 --> 00:17:39,760
Huh?-- Ouch

433
00:17:44,230 --> 00:17:46,000
The pressure is rising

434
00:17:46,000 --> 00:17:50,440
Can Miyazako sweep this atmosphere away with his nunchaku?

435
00:17:50,940 --> 00:17:52,740
Alright, everything's set

436
00:17:52,740 --> 00:17:55,240
Let's call him, Miyazako!

437
00:17:56,240 --> 00:17:57,500
How is it going?

438
00:17:58,480 --> 00:18:03,430
From now on I will

439
00:17:59,810 --> 00:18:03,430
knock down lots of balls---

440
00:18:01,390 --> 00:18:03,430
I mean, round things

441
00:18:03,880 --> 00:18:05,730
You sure you're ok?

442
00:18:08,250 --> 00:18:10,560
I'll have the staff throw lots of balls at me

443
00:18:08,250 --> 00:18:10,560
round things

444
00:18:10,570 --> 00:18:12,830
They'll gradually become smaller

445
00:18:13,530 --> 00:18:15,360
That last one...
- For real?

446
00:18:15,360 --> 00:18:16,100
It's an BB bullet

447
00:18:15,360 --> 00:18:16,100
note: airsoft bullet

448
00:18:16,100 --> 00:18:18,470
The very last one will be a BBB---

449
00:18:17,070 --> 00:18:18,470
huh---

450
00:18:20,140 --> 00:18:23,910
- Dude!
- What's going on?
- Are you alright?!

451
00:18:23,910 --> 00:18:26,380
He became one with that atmosphere

452
00:18:27,480 --> 00:18:29,490
No one in this room even laughed at what just happened

453
00:18:29,490 --> 00:18:31,050
No one in this room even laughed at what just happened

454
00:18:31,540 --> 00:18:34,050
I don't think they care

455
00:18:34,350 --> 00:18:36,660
We don't need em to laugh
- That's right

456
00:18:36,960 --> 00:18:38,960
Whenever you're ready...

457
00:18:38,960 --> 00:18:40,720
Is that tracksuit ok for this?

458
00:18:40,720 --> 00:18:41,950
Let us know

459
00:18:41,950 --> 00:18:43,550
Are your privates safe...?

460
00:18:44,840 --> 00:18:45,950
Looks good

461
00:18:48,350 --> 00:18:49,460
Man, he sucks!

462
00:18:51,810 --> 00:18:57,380
When you lose a nunchaku, you gotta hide under a wagon

463
00:18:57,840 --> 00:18:59,140
Here we go

464
00:18:59,140 --> 00:18:59,430
Yes

465
00:18:59,430 --> 00:19:03,180
Here's Miyazako attempt to raise our views-per-minute

466
00:19:03,880 --> 00:19:05,880
Can he actually do it?

467
00:19:05,880 --> 00:19:07,940
The last ones are though

468
00:19:06,910 --> 00:19:08,840
VIEWS-RAISE: START

469
00:19:08,280 --> 00:19:09,750
He only has one single hit

470
00:19:09,750 --> 00:19:11,380
Also, how are they thrown at him?

471
00:19:10,580 --> 00:19:13,640
(1) VOLLEYBALL

472
00:19:11,380 --> 00:19:12,880
It has to be one shot one hit

473
00:19:12,880 --> 00:19:14,650
A volleyball?

474
00:19:16,540 --> 00:19:18,660
Well, that one was ok

475
00:19:19,290 --> 00:19:22,140
Man, this one is small

476
00:19:19,290 --> 00:19:23,400
(2) SOFT-BALL

477
00:19:22,140 --> 00:19:23,400
This may be hard

478
00:19:23,400 --> 00:19:24,500
Isn't it too soon?

479
00:19:24,500 --> 00:19:26,680
Yeah, it suddenly became hard

480
00:19:26,680 --> 00:19:27,740
Please hit it

481
00:19:28,540 --> 00:19:29,600
Alright

482
00:19:29,600 --> 00:19:31,500
Well done!     - Ok, ok!
- Nice!

483
00:19:31,500 --> 00:19:32,900
There's still more

484
00:19:31,780 --> 00:19:35,940
(3) TENNIS BALL

485
00:19:32,900 --> 00:19:34,300
He can do this too

486
00:19:34,300 --> 00:19:36,210
Are you sure?

487
00:19:36,210 --> 00:19:37,340
It's pretty small

488
00:19:37,340 --> 00:19:39,110
It's small but I think he can do it

489
00:19:39,110 --> 00:19:40,710
Alright!

490
00:19:40,710 --> 00:19:41,510
Ok!

491
00:19:41,510 --> 00:19:43,810
I can feel our views raising

492
00:19:41,810 --> 00:19:45,640
(4) PING PONG BALL

493
00:19:43,810 --> 00:19:45,420
They're raising, they're raising!

494
00:19:45,420 --> 00:19:47,520
This one's hard

495
00:19:47,520 --> 00:19:48,740
This can turn midair

496
00:19:48,740 --> 00:19:50,290
Alright!

497
00:19:50,840 --> 00:19:51,990
He's killing it

498
00:19:51,990 --> 00:19:54,260
Our views are skyrocketing!

499
00:19:53,900 --> 00:19:58,600
(5) BOUNCY BALL

500
00:19:55,600 --> 00:19:57,230
It's a bouncy ball

501
00:19:57,230 --> 00:19:58,600
This one is tiny

502
00:19:58,600 --> 00:20:00,200
This is significantly smaller

503
00:20:05,730 --> 00:20:06,470
Alright!!

504
00:20:06,970 --> 00:20:07,670
What?!

505
00:20:08,370 --> 00:20:09,550
Didn't he just missed it?

506
00:20:09,550 --> 00:20:11,050
He just missed it, didn't he?

507
00:20:11,050 --> 00:20:12,880
I grazed it, didn't I?

508
00:20:12,070 --> 00:20:13,480
I don't think so

509
00:20:12,880 --> 00:20:14,290
I grazed it, didn't I?

510
00:20:14,290 --> 00:20:15,270
Which was it...?

511
00:20:15,270 --> 00:20:16,070
He didn't hit it

512
00:20:16,070 --> 00:20:17,220
I think I touched it

513
00:20:17,220 --> 00:20:20,660
Let me just do it again so you'll stop complaining

514
00:20:20,660 --> 00:20:22,660
Is he actually pissed off?

515
00:20:22,660 --> 00:20:24,660
What the hell?
- Is he mad?

516
00:20:24,830 --> 00:20:27,800
It totally went "pew"

517
00:20:27,800 --> 00:20:29,570
Could it be a sound issue?

518
00:20:29,570 --> 00:20:31,900
I assure you I heard the ball going "pew" here

519
00:20:32,200 --> 00:20:35,930
BOUNCY BALL - TRYING AGAIN!

520
00:20:32,730 --> 00:20:33,490
'Cause I hit it

521
00:20:33,490 --> 00:20:35,800
But it didn't
come forward

522
00:20:41,800 --> 00:20:42,500
See?

523
00:20:42,500 --> 00:20:43,300
Where did it go?

524
00:20:43,300 --> 00:20:45,170
It went straight down there

525
00:20:45,170 --> 00:20:46,380
But we couldn't see it

526
00:20:46,380 --> 00:20:49,090
That's your fucking problem

527
00:20:46,380 --> 00:20:49,090
✜

528
00:20:49,650 --> 00:20:51,490
Did he hit it?

529
00:20:49,950 --> 00:20:51,490
- Why should it be my fault?!

530
00:20:51,490 --> 00:20:53,920
It did make a sound (when it got hit)

531
00:20:54,400 --> 00:20:56,920
(6) RED BEAN

532
00:20:54,400 --> 00:20:56,920
(AZUKI)

533
00:20:55,350 --> 00:20:56,920
Next one is a red bean

534
00:20:56,920 --> 00:20:58,920
A red bean?

535
00:20:58,920 --> 00:21:01,490
We won't even see it
- We just have to hear it

536
00:21:01,490 --> 00:21:02,190
You're right

537
00:21:02,790 --> 00:21:04,160
It's too small

538
00:21:07,460 --> 00:21:08,360
Alright!

539
00:21:08,700 --> 00:21:09,730
Huh?
- You got it?

540
00:21:20,670 --> 00:21:21,250
You got it?

541
00:21:21,250 --> 00:21:25,250
. . .

542
00:21:21,250 --> 00:21:25,250
I got it, this time I really got it

543
00:21:25,250 --> 00:21:27,750
So you were lying before!!

544
00:21:27,750 --> 00:21:28,660
The super ball!

545
00:21:28,660 --> 00:21:30,830
Were you lying about the super ball?

546
00:21:31,140 --> 00:21:34,360
But you heard I hit it, so it's fine

547
00:21:34,660 --> 00:21:36,690
This is my last one, the BB bullet

548
00:21:34,810 --> 00:21:38,960
(7) BB BULLET

549
00:21:36,690 --> 00:21:38,220
How can we possibly see it?

550
00:21:40,090 --> 00:21:40,690
Ready

551
00:21:42,860 --> 00:21:43,310
Alright!

552
00:21:46,370 --> 00:21:47,300
Oh, this---?

553
00:21:47,730 --> 00:21:48,900
You didn't hit it!

554
00:21:48,900 --> 00:21:50,440
He didn't hit it

555
00:21:50,440 --> 00:21:51,440
It went through

556
00:21:51,440 --> 00:21:52,010
So clearly

557
00:21:52,010 --> 00:21:53,650
But it just went "pew"

558
00:21:53,650 --> 00:21:57,690
It didn't go "pew"
- Come on, enough of that

559
00:21:57,690 --> 00:22:00,720
Just get back here

560
00:21:59,040 --> 00:22:00,720
This guy is a
troublemaker

561
00:22:00,720 --> 00:22:02,550
Get back here
- Just come back

562
00:22:02,550 --> 00:22:03,280
Come back

563
00:22:02,890 --> 00:22:05,530
Let me be clear on this: I'm not coming back!

564
00:22:07,160 --> 00:22:09,760
I think that's the worst one by far...

565
00:22:08,590 --> 00:22:09,760
- Yeah, I agree

566
00:22:09,960 --> 00:22:12,190
'Cause he had some pride about it

567
00:22:12,760 --> 00:22:14,470
Come on, get back here

568
00:22:14,570 --> 00:22:18,260
What are you exulting for?
- You got that wrong...

569
00:22:18,260 --> 00:22:20,400
It didn't go that well

570
00:22:20,400 --> 00:22:22,140
What the hell, man

571
00:22:22,140 --> 00:22:25,680
Man, I didn't think I could actually make it through

572
00:22:25,680 --> 00:22:28,050
But you didn't made it!

573
00:22:28,050 --> 00:22:31,150
No one told me just a "pew" sound wasn't enough...

574
00:22:31,150 --> 00:22:33,210
I grazed em all, it was perfect

575
00:22:33,210 --> 00:22:36,510
But it was "knock down", you had to knock em down

576
00:22:36,510 --> 00:22:39,720
But you saw it, I mean--- the super ball fell down, yes?

577
00:22:39,720 --> 00:22:41,720
Yeah it did, behind you
- It fell, right?

578
00:22:41,720 --> 00:22:42,240
Behind you

579
00:22:42,240 --> 00:22:43,920
And it made a "pew" sound too

580
00:22:44,330 --> 00:22:47,430
Our views-per-minute are slowly dying, let's quit it

581
00:22:47,430 --> 00:22:49,140
He's right

582
00:22:50,490 --> 00:22:52,660
Here's our next special skill

583
00:22:53,460 --> 00:22:54,620
What is it...?

584
00:22:55,230 --> 00:22:56,940
"Drawn sword fresh cut"

585
00:22:56,940 --> 00:22:58,940
It sound dangerous
- So cool

586
00:22:58,940 --> 00:23:00,370
Who's this?

587
00:23:02,310 --> 00:23:03,200
Drawn sword, yes

588
00:23:03,820 --> 00:23:06,050
I mean, we know you used to do kendo back then

589
00:23:06,050 --> 00:23:08,790
But a real sword is completely different

590
00:23:08,790 --> 00:23:10,160
But really

591
00:23:10,160 --> 00:23:12,330
A single false step and there goes one leg

592
00:23:12,680 --> 00:23:14,330
You'd be like "AH!"

593
00:23:17,840 --> 00:23:19,660
What a great shout!

594
00:23:20,680 --> 00:23:21,660
