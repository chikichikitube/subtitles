1
00:00:23,320 --> 00:00:26,840
What is the most difficult part about Documental?

2
00:00:26,840 --> 00:00:29,960
Well, umm...

3
00:00:29,960 --> 00:00:32,410
They become out of the loop

4
00:00:32,410 --> 00:00:34,740
Well...

5
00:00:34,740 --> 00:00:40,570
Of course, this is nothing like being on stage, there's no audiences and no laughters

6
00:00:40,570 --> 00:00:48,520
For comedians, having no laughter is like having no lighthouse

7
00:00:48,520 --> 00:00:51,570
Kawashima-san that's no good

8
00:00:52,220 --> 00:00:53,970
That's no good Ku-chan

9
00:00:53,970 --> 00:00:57,750
Feeling like "where am I heading?"

10
00:00:57,750 --> 00:01:01,800
And they may feel anxious from time to time

11
00:01:01,800 --> 00:01:03,140
But the reverse is also true

12
00:01:03,140 --> 00:01:08,720
While there's no laughter, they may think that this part is hilarious and try to elaborate further

13
00:01:08,720 --> 00:01:12,160
Just to find out it was not interesting at all afterwards

14
00:01:12,160 --> 00:01:16,600
It's me, it's me, Hamburger!

15
00:01:17,420 --> 00:01:19,090
So I've prepared...

16
00:02:27,280 --> 00:02:30,060
What the heck is Pengin Shokudo nara?

17
00:02:30,060 --> 00:02:31,650
Pengin Shokudo

18
00:02:31,650 --> 00:02:33,310
There's throwable Shumai too

19
00:02:43,300 --> 00:02:48,110
Young actors be like "How are you doing buddy"

20
00:02:48,110 --> 00:02:49,100
Between you two?

21
00:02:49,100 --> 00:02:50,400
You mean Fujimon-san?

22
00:02:50,400 --> 00:02:51,920
Who do you mean?

23
00:02:52,530 --> 00:02:54,180
You mean me?

24
00:02:54,180 --> 00:02:55,750
Who?

25
00:02:55,750 --> 00:02:56,710
What happened?

26
00:02:57,220 --> 00:02:59,260
Wait a second...

27
00:02:59,260 --> 00:03:00,530
Why are you covering your mouth like that?

28
00:03:00,530 --> 00:03:04,260
Ah, a lot came out

29
00:03:04,260 --> 00:03:06,200
Is Kurosawa-san laughing?

30
00:03:07,100 --> 00:03:10,540
Oh, come on, you're so drunk again

31
00:03:10,540 --> 00:03:13,980
Oh, don't fall asleep here

32
00:03:13,980 --> 00:03:16,860
Wow, orange...

33
00:03:18,490 --> 00:03:22,200
The nipples beam cross section is in heart shape

34
00:03:24,220 --> 00:03:26,210
Ah, straddle

35
00:03:26,210 --> 00:03:31,220
Ah, ah, straddle, straddle

36
00:03:31,220 --> 00:03:34,240
Well, maybe yellow...

37
00:03:34,240 --> 00:03:35,580
Are these words...

38
00:03:35,580 --> 00:03:36,690
Ka-ha!

39
00:03:36,690 --> 00:03:38,760
Ka-ha?

40
00:03:38,760 --> 00:03:40,700
Wait a second...

41
00:03:40,700 --> 00:03:44,810
-You're just one step away, you'll be out next time
-Yes, I understand

42
00:03:53,700 --> 00:03:55,560
Is he angry about this?

43
00:03:55,560 --> 00:03:56,580
I have no idea

44
00:03:56,580 --> 00:03:58,050
He didn't say anything to me

45
00:03:58,050 --> 00:04:01,900
That's just because Daisuke-shisho didn't know he was being fooled

46
00:04:01,900 --> 00:04:03,860
-But I bet you put a lot of effort
-Yeah, it's amazing

47
00:04:03,860 --> 00:04:05,390
Yeah, it took me a lot of time

48
00:04:05,390 --> 00:04:07,810
-Did you make this with computer?
-Yes

49
00:04:07,810 --> 00:04:11,640
I need to crop the photo first, and then merge it again

50
00:04:11,640 --> 00:04:14,290
-He was squeezed in this photo right?
-Yes

51
00:04:14,290 --> 00:04:14,940
Close up view...

52
00:04:14,940 --> 00:04:18,310
SHA-SHA-SHAAA

53
00:04:18,310 --> 00:04:19,450
SHA-SHA

54
00:04:19,450 --> 00:04:21,680
Why are you screaming like Gamera

55
00:04:21,680 --> 00:04:22,730
SHA-SHA-SHA

56
00:04:22,730 --> 00:04:24,100
The close up view was good

57
00:04:24,100 --> 00:04:28,580
By the way, I've brought some new smartphone cases as well

58
00:04:28,580 --> 00:04:29,690
Smartphone case?

59
00:04:29,690 --> 00:04:33,020
Please help me pick one

60
00:04:33,020 --> 00:04:35,560
Wait a second, Nishizawa's smartphone case?

61
00:04:35,560 --> 00:04:37,560
This is scary

62
00:04:39,130 --> 00:04:40,730
This is it

63
00:04:40,730 --> 00:04:43,750
It's translucent, we can see it already...

64
00:04:43,750 --> 00:04:47,100
-Huh, did you laugh?
-No, I didn't

65
00:04:52,800 --> 00:04:54,050
No, he's not dead yet

66
00:04:54,050 --> 00:04:56,490
-He's Yoshio-shisho
-Yes

67
00:04:59,060 --> 00:05:00,100
Who is that?

68
00:05:00,100 --> 00:05:03,010
-He's Obitani-san
-Ah, he's Pot (his nickname)

69
00:05:03,410 --> 00:05:05,520
This is amazing

70
00:05:05,520 --> 00:05:07,890
-So Yoshimoto is selling these?
-Yeah...

71
00:05:05,520 --> 00:05:10,640
*The people on the smartphone cases are all employed by Yoshimoto

72
00:05:07,890 --> 00:05:10,640
-Yoshimoto is even selling Obitani-san?
-Well...

73
00:05:10,640 --> 00:05:12,090
That's amazing

74
00:05:12,090 --> 00:05:15,060
-No one will buy Obitani-san
-But that regent haircut is freaking cool

75
00:05:17,460 --> 00:05:18,860
It's Obitani-san

76
00:05:18,860 --> 00:05:21,430
-From a different time
-Eh, is this Obitani-san?

77
00:05:21,430 --> 00:05:25,760
He looks like BayStars' Miura Daisuke from this angle

78
00:05:25,760 --> 00:05:28,530
-Ah, yeah you're right
-Especially his hairstyle

79
00:05:28,530 --> 00:05:33,580
-But it's from a different time right?
-Yeah, his glasses are different

80
00:05:34,640 --> 00:05:36,580
Shinpuruosan-shisho

81
00:05:36,580 --> 00:05:39,860
-Those tiny teeth look good right?
-That's not the main point dude

82
00:05:43,710 --> 00:05:45,650
Sakata-shisho

83
00:05:45,650 --> 00:05:47,460
I can't make up my mind what to choose

84
00:05:47,460 --> 00:05:51,930
Is he wearing a restaurant napkin?

85
00:05:51,930 --> 00:05:54,640
Sakata-shisho...

86
00:05:54,640 --> 00:05:55,770
That's impolite

87
00:05:55,770 --> 00:05:59,640
The elevator at Kozamu-shisho's house is very slow

88
00:05:59,640 --> 00:06:01,210
There's an elevator at his house?

89
00:06:01,210 --> 00:06:03,310
It's a stand-alone house with elevator

90
00:06:03,310 --> 00:06:05,540
-Have you been to his house?
-Yes, I did

91
00:06:05,540 --> 00:06:06,950
-There's an elevator right?
-Yes

92
00:06:06,950 --> 00:06:09,550
-And it's unbelievable right?
-Yes, it is

93
00:06:09,550 --> 00:06:11,270
It's like this

94
00:06:12,200 --> 00:06:13,990
-Is it that slow?
-Amazing

95
00:06:21,650 --> 00:06:24,010
It must be Nishizawa

96
00:06:25,140 --> 00:06:27,630
-Because of Miyazako-san...
-He laughed slightly like "ku-su"

97
00:06:27,630 --> 00:06:30,270
He laughed at the speed of Miyazako-san elevating

98
00:06:30,920 --> 00:06:32,460
It's Nishizawa right?

99
00:06:33,220 --> 00:06:35,120
It's Nishizawa, but...

100
00:06:35,120 --> 00:06:37,780
But I didn't see that clearly too

101
00:06:38,790 --> 00:06:40,500
Let's confirm this together

102
00:06:40,500 --> 00:06:43,610
-Have you been to his house?
-Yes, I did

103
00:06:43,610 --> 00:06:45,600
-There's an elevator right?
-Yes, there is

104
00:06:45,600 --> 00:06:47,630
-And it's unbelievable right?
-Yes, it is

105
00:06:47,630 --> 00:06:49,830
It's like this

106
00:06:51,380 --> 00:06:53,380
He laughed

107
00:06:53,380 --> 00:06:55,660
This is the most natural type of laughing

108
00:06:55,660 --> 00:06:57,870
Yes, I understand

109
00:06:57,870 --> 00:06:59,960
You just laughed out naturally

110
00:06:59,960 --> 00:07:02,000
You seem to forget about this for a moment

111
00:07:02,000 --> 00:07:04,460
-But that elevator is seriously so slow
-It's really that slow?

112
00:07:04,460 --> 00:07:07,750
Before he even reaches the 2nd floor,
his wife went back-and-forth for 4 times already

113
00:07:07,750 --> 00:07:10,760
-4 times?
-I must have laughed if I heard 4 times

114
00:07:10,760 --> 00:07:12,800
We're in danger if we heard that

115
00:07:12,800 --> 00:07:14,260
No, no, no

116
00:07:14,260 --> 00:07:15,550
It's safe for now

117
00:07:15,550 --> 00:07:17,140
What a waste though

118
00:07:17,140 --> 00:07:19,580
Ah, I missed this one, that was close

119
00:07:19,580 --> 00:07:22,540
-Let's start
-Yes

120
00:07:22,540 --> 00:07:25,290
This is getting serious

121
00:07:29,680 --> 00:07:31,130
Let's start

122
00:07:35,830 --> 00:07:37,780
I bet no one will buy these

123
00:07:37,780 --> 00:07:39,330
Obitani-san should be salable

124
00:07:39,330 --> 00:07:40,300
No way

125
00:07:40,300 --> 00:07:41,760
Maybe like 300 yen?

126
00:07:41,760 --> 00:07:43,630
No, that's too expensive

127
00:07:43,630 --> 00:07:45,340
I have a present for everyone too

128
00:07:45,340 --> 00:07:47,160
Eh, really?

129
00:07:47,160 --> 00:07:49,600
What is it? Photos?

130
00:07:49,600 --> 00:07:51,110
Itoda-san are these photos?

131
00:07:51,110 --> 00:07:52,080
Photos?

132
00:07:52,080 --> 00:07:53,360
-Can I open it?
-Sure

133
00:07:53,360 --> 00:07:57,620
Let's open it together, one, two, three...

134
00:07:57,960 --> 00:07:58,970
She's your mother...

135
00:07:58,970 --> 00:08:00,000
Ah, mother-in-law?

136
00:08:00,000 --> 00:08:02,160
It should be ex-mother-in-law

137
00:08:02,160 --> 00:08:05,140
I want to watch this badly

138
00:08:06,000 --> 00:08:07,630
Let's watch this together

139
00:08:07,630 --> 00:08:09,430
Why though?

140
00:08:09,430 --> 00:08:11,430
I hope everyone knows more about her

141
00:08:11,430 --> 00:08:13,860
Know more about your mother-in-law?

142
00:08:13,860 --> 00:08:16,050
(Come on...)

143
00:08:16,050 --> 00:08:17,710
This is awful

144
00:08:17,710 --> 00:08:19,540
-She's beautiful right?
-Yeah, beautiful

145
00:08:19,540 --> 00:08:20,380
Look at this

146
00:08:20,380 --> 00:08:22,780
That's pretty aggressive

147
00:08:22,780 --> 00:08:25,950
-Ah, she's really showing everything
-Yes, everything

148
00:08:29,460 --> 00:08:31,230
-She's beautiful
-Absolutely beautiful

149
00:08:31,230 --> 00:08:35,040
-She was 60 years old when taking these photos
-Eh, 60 years old?

150
00:08:35,040 --> 00:08:38,420
Really?

151
00:08:40,430 --> 00:08:42,950
I can totally understand why she wants to make photo books

152
00:08:42,950 --> 00:08:44,810
Yeah, she's really beautiful

153
00:08:45,560 --> 00:08:47,410
Is this in demand?

154
00:08:47,410 --> 00:08:48,950
This actually sold a lot

155
00:08:48,950 --> 00:08:51,300
Yeah, that must be true

156
00:08:51,300 --> 00:08:53,120
Nobu, this page is amazing, have a look

157
00:08:53,120 --> 00:08:55,030
No, I'm good

158
00:08:55,030 --> 00:08:56,150
This page

159
00:08:56,790 --> 00:08:57,740
Check it out

160
00:08:57,740 --> 00:09:00,180
No, I'm good, I can watch it on my own

161
00:09:04,960 --> 00:09:07,360
-This page right?
-Yes

162
00:09:11,270 --> 00:09:13,480
The next few pages are good too

163
00:09:15,610 --> 00:09:16,760
Hey...

164
00:09:16,760 --> 00:09:17,610
This is...

165
00:09:17,610 --> 00:09:19,020
A mysterious page?

166
00:09:19,020 --> 00:09:20,150
Mysterious page?

167
00:09:20,150 --> 00:09:22,410
These pages are sticking together tightly

168
00:09:22,410 --> 00:09:24,440
Eh?

169
00:09:24,440 --> 00:09:25,900
Look at this

170
00:09:25,900 --> 00:09:28,680
-Eww...
-Come on

171
00:09:30,030 --> 00:09:32,130
-He must have masturbated
-Seriously?

172
00:09:32,130 --> 00:09:33,390
He masturbated to his mother

173
00:09:33,390 --> 00:09:36,680
*The original line is "If you want to pity me, then give me money" from the famous drama "Ie Naki Ko" (Child Without a Home)

174
00:09:33,390 --> 00:09:36,680
If you want to pity me, then masturbate to me*

175
00:09:37,250 --> 00:09:38,390
Ah, I screwed up

176
00:09:38,680 --> 00:09:42,010
How could you masturbate to that?

177
00:09:42,010 --> 00:09:45,930
Eh, did you say something just now?

178
00:09:50,800 --> 00:09:52,950
Hey guys...

179
00:09:52,950 --> 00:09:54,160
I got a tattoo

180
00:09:54,160 --> 00:09:55,810
-Eh?
-What are you talking about?

181
00:09:55,810 --> 00:09:59,350
Well, I'm a comedian and I thought it's a good time to get one

182
00:09:59,350 --> 00:10:00,790
Are you fine with this?

183
00:10:00,790 --> 00:10:02,550
I just wanted to get one badly

184
00:10:02,550 --> 00:10:04,710
And I'm a comedian, it shouldn't matter

185
00:10:04,710 --> 00:10:07,850
But there must be tasks that ask us to get naked

186
00:10:07,850 --> 00:10:11,040
-That's not like you Fujimon
-You can't even use a public pool

187
00:10:11,040 --> 00:10:12,860
Eh, where is the tattoo?

188
00:10:12,860 --> 00:10:15,050
There's no tattoo

189
00:10:18,610 --> 00:10:19,590
That's very well-done

190
00:10:19,590 --> 00:10:22,690
-Why would you get a tattoo of your duo partner?
-What an amazing duo love

191
00:10:22,690 --> 00:10:27,820
That's the face of him after doing gags right?

192
00:10:27,820 --> 00:10:29,390
It's the face after the gag "Ore-yade" right?

193
00:10:29,390 --> 00:10:31,810
No, it's after the gag "De-de-de-de"

194
00:10:37,880 --> 00:10:39,770
-It will never come off
-Are you fine with that?

195
00:10:39,770 --> 00:10:42,830
Excuse me, I want to tell you guys something too

196
00:10:42,830 --> 00:10:44,870
I got a tattoo too

197
00:10:44,870 --> 00:10:47,990
Seriously?

198
00:10:48,430 --> 00:10:52,090
Nobu especially doesn't have that impression

199
00:10:52,090 --> 00:10:54,610
Maybe it's good to have some contrast though

200
00:10:54,610 --> 00:10:56,640
-The tattoo is fire
-Fire?

201
00:10:56,640 --> 00:10:58,160
Ah, fire...

202
00:10:58,160 --> 00:11:00,880
Yes, fire

203
00:11:00,880 --> 00:11:02,330
Because I wanted to fire myself up

204
00:11:02,330 --> 00:11:04,420
-I see
-I can totally understand that

205
00:11:04,420 --> 00:11:05,570
Fire?

206
00:11:05,570 --> 00:11:07,570
Yeah, that does fire one up

207
00:11:09,040 --> 00:11:10,060
I got..

208
00:11:10,060 --> 00:11:12,980
I got a tattoo on my armpits

209
00:11:15,000 --> 00:11:16,760
That's amazing

210
00:11:16,760 --> 00:11:19,040
So it's black fire right?

211
00:11:19,040 --> 00:11:21,100
Black fire

212
00:11:21,100 --> 00:11:22,960
Ah, that's amazing

213
00:11:22,960 --> 00:11:24,760
I've actually...

214
00:11:24,760 --> 00:11:26,340
You got a tattoo too?

215
00:11:26,340 --> 00:11:28,800
Yes, please let me confess this, I got a tattoo too

216
00:11:28,800 --> 00:11:32,130
-Eh?
-That's no good for you, Iio-san

217
00:11:32,130 --> 00:11:34,570
I actually didn't want to show this to anyone

218
00:11:34,570 --> 00:11:36,380
Eh? Are you fine with this?

219
00:11:36,380 --> 00:11:38,020
Especially not on TV

220
00:11:38,020 --> 00:11:40,300
Yeah, I understand that

221
00:11:40,300 --> 00:11:42,120
-Anyway, please have a look
-Eh, really?

222
00:11:42,120 --> 00:11:45,160
If you guys think it's inappropriate, I'll do a laser removal

223
00:11:45,160 --> 00:11:46,680
And remove the tattoo

224
00:11:46,680 --> 00:11:50,090
-That doesn't match your character
-Yes, I know

225
00:11:50,090 --> 00:11:53,490
But I really want to move one step forward

226
00:11:53,490 --> 00:11:55,100
Please have a look

227
00:11:56,070 --> 00:11:58,270
Please tell me your true feelings

228
00:11:58,270 --> 00:11:59,360
Is it okay for you?

229
00:11:59,360 --> 00:12:02,200
If you guys say it looks good, then I'll just keep it

230
00:12:02,960 --> 00:12:04,250
-Ready?
-Yes

231
00:12:04,250 --> 00:12:05,190
Seriously?

232
00:12:05,190 --> 00:12:06,870
Where is it?

233
00:12:06,870 --> 00:12:09,070
Despite my age, these are on pink fire

234
00:12:15,150 --> 00:12:17,500
-That's a tattoo?
-That's not a tattoo

235
00:12:17,500 --> 00:12:18,950
So it's a pink tattoo?

236
00:12:18,950 --> 00:12:21,040
-Ah, pink tattoo?
-Colored tattoo?

237
00:12:21,040 --> 00:12:23,320
That's amazing

238
00:12:24,570 --> 00:12:27,500
-They do look pink
-They're beautiful

239
00:12:27,500 --> 00:12:30,260
Nipples show a person's character right?

240
00:12:30,650 --> 00:12:32,990
Your nipples and your face are related right?

241
00:12:32,990 --> 00:12:36,170
Well, I heard that the size of your nipple is the same as your eye pupil

242
00:12:37,810 --> 00:12:38,880
No way dude

243
00:12:44,660 --> 00:12:47,020
Your nipples are the same as Kazama Morio

244
00:12:47,020 --> 00:12:48,870
Ah, yeah, the color is the same

245
00:12:48,870 --> 00:12:49,920
-They look the same?
-Yes

246
00:12:49,920 --> 00:12:52,560
The color is same

247
00:12:58,660 --> 00:13:02,540
Excuse me...

248
00:13:02,540 --> 00:13:05,740
Excuse me...

249
00:13:05,740 --> 00:13:08,270
I lost my wallet

250
00:13:08,270 --> 00:13:09,920
-Wallet?
-Yes

251
00:13:09,920 --> 00:13:12,380
Eh? Where did you lose it?

252
00:13:12,380 --> 00:13:13,880
-Wallet?
-Yes

253
00:13:13,880 --> 00:13:14,560
We didn't see it

254
00:13:14,560 --> 00:13:16,120
Your hair is so freaking thick dude

255
00:13:16,120 --> 00:13:17,530
-Yes?
-Your hair is so thick

256
00:13:17,530 --> 00:13:18,680
-Are you a student?
-Yes

257
00:13:18,680 --> 00:13:22,150
-Did anyone see my wallet
-Your forehead is so narrow

258
00:13:22,150 --> 00:13:24,030
No, we didn't see it

259
00:13:24,030 --> 00:13:25,860
But I'm sure I lost it somewhere here

260
00:13:25,860 --> 00:13:27,860
I lost it here

261
00:13:27,860 --> 00:13:29,950
What kind of wallet?

262
00:13:29,950 --> 00:13:31,780
Eh, it's a Puma wallet

263
00:13:31,780 --> 00:13:33,000
Puma?

264
00:13:33,000 --> 00:13:34,700
Are you a high school student?

265
00:13:34,700 --> 00:13:38,480
-It's a Puma with hook-and-loop fastener
-Ah I see, the one that sounds "bilibili"

266
00:13:38,480 --> 00:13:40,100
How does it looks like?

267
00:13:40,730 --> 00:13:42,490
It's a checked wallet

268
00:13:42,490 --> 00:13:45,020
I've never seen a checked wallet from Puma

269
00:13:45,020 --> 00:13:47,040
It's rare to see a checked wallet from Puma

270
00:13:47,040 --> 00:13:49,950
-Your hair is so freaking thick dude
-Yes?

271
00:13:49,950 --> 00:13:52,650
Ah, really? I just cut my hair yesterday

272
00:13:52,650 --> 00:13:53,780
Yesterday?

273
00:13:53,780 --> 00:13:55,700
Your hair is growing so fast

274
00:13:55,700 --> 00:13:58,440
-Well...
-It looks like a honeycomb

275
00:13:58,440 --> 00:14:00,510
-Are you on a school trip?
-I just asked them to make it thinner

276
00:14:00,510 --> 00:14:02,320
-Are you on a school trip?
-Nope

277
00:14:02,320 --> 00:14:03,580
-You're local?
-Yes, I'm local

278
00:14:03,580 --> 00:14:05,160
And his forehead is so narrow

279
00:14:05,160 --> 00:14:07,510
We just can't find your wallet though

280
00:14:07,510 --> 00:14:09,790
-How come...
-We didn't take it

281
00:14:09,790 --> 00:14:11,200
We didn't dude

282
00:14:11,200 --> 00:14:13,250
-We didn't take it
-Are you suspecting us?

283
00:14:13,250 --> 00:14:14,870
Just leave

284
00:14:14,870 --> 00:14:16,330
Yeah, I'm leaving already

285
00:14:16,330 --> 00:14:18,840
You're scaring me, stop being moody

286
00:14:19,410 --> 00:14:20,220
Just leave dude

287
00:14:20,220 --> 00:14:21,780
I'm leaving

288
00:14:24,000 --> 00:14:28,290
Didn't your mom say anything about your hair?

289
00:14:28,290 --> 00:14:29,060
Huh?

290
00:14:29,060 --> 00:14:31,240
Didn't your mom say anything about your hairstyle?

291
00:14:31,240 --> 00:14:31,810
Yes, she did

292
00:14:31,810 --> 00:14:34,190
She did right? She asked you to cut more right?

293
00:14:34,190 --> 00:14:37,100
Go make your hair thinner first

294
00:14:37,100 --> 00:14:39,520
Tell us your name and leave

295
00:14:39,520 --> 00:14:41,280
I'm Saji Minoru

296
00:14:41,280 --> 00:14:42,950
Saji?

297
00:14:43,660 --> 00:14:45,970
Your last name is Saji?

298
00:14:45,970 --> 00:14:47,570
How do you spell it?

299
00:14:47,570 --> 00:14:51,130
*"左 (Sa)" which means "Left" and "自 (Ji)" which means "Myself"

300
00:14:47,570 --> 00:14:51,130
You spell it with "Left" and "Myself"

301
00:14:51,130 --> 00:14:53,630
*"寺 (Ji)" which means "Temple"

302
00:14:51,130 --> 00:14:53,630
-Ah, it should be temple, excuse me
-How could you get that wrong?

303
00:14:53,630 --> 00:14:56,080
You must be lying if you got that wrong

304
00:14:56,080 --> 00:14:59,670
-"Left temple"?
-And it's pronounced as Saji

305
00:14:59,670 --> 00:15:00,900
What's your first name?

306
00:15:00,900 --> 00:15:03,090
-It's Minoru
-Minoru?

307
00:15:03,090 --> 00:15:04,960
So the usual Minoru?

308
00:15:04,960 --> 00:15:07,440
It's "Jitsu"

309
00:15:07,440 --> 00:15:09,590
So just one word "Jitsu"

310
00:15:09,590 --> 00:15:11,380
And then "Noru"

311
00:15:11,380 --> 00:15:12,810
Hiragana?

312
00:15:14,350 --> 00:15:15,750
-Noru is in Haragana?
-Yes

313
00:15:15,750 --> 00:15:18,110
Have you ever heard Noru in Hiragana?

314
00:15:18,110 --> 00:15:20,130
-And with Saji
-Never heard that before

315
00:15:20,130 --> 00:15:22,440
Okay, I understand

316
00:15:24,510 --> 00:15:26,860
His hair is so thick

317
00:15:26,860 --> 00:15:28,680
And his forehead is so narrow

318
00:15:30,940 --> 00:15:31,940
Are you suspecting us?

319
00:15:31,940 --> 00:15:33,380
He's absolutely suspecting us

320
00:15:33,380 --> 00:15:35,680
-We didn't take it
-I'll tell you if I find it

321
00:15:43,110 --> 00:15:45,910
Sakata-shisho was admitted to the hospital recently

322
00:15:45,910 --> 00:15:46,830
Eh?

323
00:15:46,830 --> 00:15:50,030
He wasn't feeling well and went to the hospital

324
00:15:50,030 --> 00:15:54,720
He then pressed the nurse call button, and the nurses came and ask him "What happened?"

325
00:15:54,720 --> 00:15:56,840
And he said "A lion is staring at me from the cooler"

326
00:15:56,840 --> 00:15:58,910
Eh, really? That's terrifying

327
00:16:04,130 --> 00:16:07,050
-We can call food delivery right
-Oh, yeah

328
00:16:13,940 --> 00:16:17,210
What can we call for food delivery though

329
00:16:17,210 --> 00:16:19,380
-Just choose whatever is on there dude
-Eh?

330
00:16:19,380 --> 00:16:20,630
You Kariyushi*

331
00:16:19,380 --> 00:16:22,510
*Kariyushi is a pun from the previous episodes

332
00:16:20,630 --> 00:16:22,510
Kariyushi? Was that my name?

333
00:16:28,200 --> 00:16:31,390
-Sorry for being rude to you
-No problem at all

334
00:16:34,330 --> 00:16:35,750
Kurosawa got changed over there right?

335
00:16:35,750 --> 00:16:37,900
Ah, I see, you can hide inside here

336
00:16:37,900 --> 00:16:40,550
-I see
-Yeah, you're right

337
00:16:43,720 --> 00:16:44,850
There's no camera here

338
00:16:53,830 --> 00:16:55,500
Let's do something

339
00:17:01,420 --> 00:17:02,690
Fujimon

340
00:17:04,030 --> 00:17:06,420
I'm feeling hungry

341
00:17:06,420 --> 00:17:10,070
-That's dry ice
-Come on

342
00:17:12,250 --> 00:17:14,160
That's dry ice dude

343
00:17:16,580 --> 00:17:21,180
It's not ice, it's dry ice, and it's coming out from your nose

344
00:17:21,180 --> 00:17:22,450
What an entertainer

345
00:17:22,450 --> 00:17:25,480
-He's putting too much in his mouth
-Is he doing this wrong?

346
00:17:26,950 --> 00:17:28,480
Aren't you guys hungry?

347
00:17:28,480 --> 00:17:30,530
Yeah, I'm starving

348
00:17:30,530 --> 00:17:31,810
It's 3 o'clock already

349
00:17:31,810 --> 00:17:35,330
It's gonna stick to your mouth, spit it out now!

350
00:17:35,330 --> 00:17:39,290
The dry ice is gonna stick to your mouth forever

351
00:17:39,290 --> 00:17:40,320
Won't it melt though?

352
00:17:40,320 --> 00:17:42,860
No, it won't melt, it'll just stick to his mouth, this is dangerous

353
00:17:42,860 --> 00:17:44,050
It's too cold

354
00:17:44,050 --> 00:17:46,640
Of course it's too cold dude

355
00:17:46,640 --> 00:17:49,620
A lot of smoke came out

356
00:17:49,620 --> 00:17:52,780
And Nishizwa what can I do with this?

357
00:17:52,780 --> 00:17:55,720
-Well...
-I tried to wear it

358
00:17:55,720 --> 00:17:57,800
Yes, I can see you wearing it

359
00:17:57,800 --> 00:17:59,800
What can I do with this?

360
00:17:59,800 --> 00:18:02,480
Well, I'm sorry

361
00:18:03,060 --> 00:18:04,980
Are you fine?

362
00:18:04,980 --> 00:18:05,810
I'm fine

363
00:18:05,810 --> 00:18:06,960
It's gonna stick to your mouth

364
00:18:06,960 --> 00:18:08,070
Just keep rolling it

365
00:18:08,070 --> 00:18:10,670
-Keep rolling it?
-Yes, or else it will stick to your mouth

366
00:18:10,670 --> 00:18:12,400
It's gonna tear off your skin

367
00:18:12,400 --> 00:18:12,950
Eh, seriously?

368
00:18:12,950 --> 00:18:14,980
Yeah, so you have to drink some water immediately

369
00:18:15,480 --> 00:18:19,760
-I can drink some water first right?
-Well, yeah, you're right

370
00:18:25,160 --> 00:18:29,080
-You need to close your mouth
-Then it'll come out from your nose

371
00:18:29,080 --> 00:18:32,160
That's so weak

372
00:18:36,100 --> 00:18:39,410
That's as weak as the humidifier beside the bed

373
00:18:39,410 --> 00:18:41,620
The small and weak one right?

374
00:18:41,620 --> 00:18:43,510
Yeah, the small one that looks like a lamp

375
00:18:47,440 --> 00:18:48,510
It's not coming out at all

376
00:18:51,680 --> 00:18:53,010
Because you kept your mouth open

377
00:18:53,010 --> 00:18:55,570
This is so difficult

378
00:18:55,570 --> 00:18:57,190
Because you opened your mouth

379
00:18:57,190 --> 00:18:59,270
This is just so difficult

380
00:19:01,120 --> 00:19:03,850
Let's put that aside

381
00:19:03,850 --> 00:19:05,540
Okay

382
00:19:05,540 --> 00:19:07,120
Wow, it's frozen

383
00:19:07,120 --> 00:19:08,860
Ah, it's hardened

384
00:19:08,860 --> 00:19:10,620
That must taste good with beer

385
00:19:10,620 --> 00:19:11,830
No way dude

386
00:19:11,830 --> 00:19:14,550
I mean like an ice beer

387
00:19:14,550 --> 00:19:15,860
Ah, I see what you mean

388
00:19:15,860 --> 00:19:17,320
You're so loud

389
00:19:17,320 --> 00:19:18,510
AH, I SEE WHAT YOU MEAN

390
00:19:18,510 --> 00:19:20,910
You're so loud

391
00:19:20,910 --> 00:19:25,080
-Miyazako-san is always so loud right?
-Yeah, he is

392
00:19:25,080 --> 00:19:27,240
-Remember how he sings?
-Yeah

393
00:19:27,240 --> 00:19:33,450
Like when he sings "I want to hear your voice"

394
00:19:27,240 --> 00:19:41,090
*"I want to hear your voice" is a line from the song "Subete ga Boku no Chikara ni Naru!" by Miyazako (Kuzu)

395
00:19:33,450 --> 00:19:35,680
But you're singing it wrong though

396
00:19:36,700 --> 00:19:41,090
It should be "I want to hear your voice" right?

397
00:19:41,090 --> 00:19:42,750
That's wrong too

398
00:19:45,060 --> 00:19:47,470
Just a bit wrong though

399
00:19:47,470 --> 00:19:50,400
"I want to hear your voice"

400
00:19:51,850 --> 00:19:55,410
"I want to hear your voice"

401
00:19:55,410 --> 00:19:56,970
You mean the melody is wrong

402
00:19:56,970 --> 00:19:59,420
Money, Hamada Shogo

403
00:20:00,450 --> 00:20:05,100
These are the most hilarious answers for my past Oogiri

404
00:20:05,290 --> 00:20:07,570
What about the question for the Oogiri?

405
00:20:07,570 --> 00:20:09,910
Only the answer for the Oogiri?

406
00:20:09,910 --> 00:20:11,560
Only the answer?

407
00:20:11,560 --> 00:20:14,430
Please ask me any question, I bet the answers will fit

408
00:20:14,430 --> 00:20:17,050
Eh? It will fit any question?

409
00:20:17,050 --> 00:20:20,580
I've prepared loads of answers, and I'll just show it one after another

410
00:20:20,580 --> 00:20:23,920
-Eh? And it will fit whatever question?
-Yes, the answer will fit whatever

411
00:20:23,920 --> 00:20:26,150
I don't want this kind of school!
What kind of school is it?

412
00:20:26,150 --> 00:20:30,910
Because it's always autumn for us

413
00:20:30,910 --> 00:20:32,240
Well, it does fit

414
00:20:32,240 --> 00:20:34,730
Yeah, in some sense

415
00:20:34,730 --> 00:20:37,050
-It's quite poetic
-Yeah, it is

416
00:20:37,050 --> 00:20:38,670
Any more questions?

417
00:20:38,670 --> 00:20:41,010
Let me think...

418
00:20:41,010 --> 00:20:49,120
What is the name of the new Shinkansen
after Kodama, Hikari and Nozomi?

419
00:20:50,190 --> 00:20:52,730
Madrid's sun will decide it

420
00:20:52,730 --> 00:20:53,440
That's so long

421
00:20:55,170 --> 00:20:56,710
What kind of pet is annoying?

422
00:20:57,980 --> 00:20:59,910
A gift in return for a funeral offering

423
00:20:59,910 --> 00:21:02,050
-So the pet is given in return?
-I bet so

424
00:21:02,050 --> 00:21:04,560
-A pet is given in return?
-Like a black cat

425
00:21:04,560 --> 00:21:06,880
That's scary

426
00:21:06,880 --> 00:21:09,700
Comment on this photo (Sakata-shisho)

427
00:21:09,700 --> 00:21:13,440
*Sakata-shisho is famous for being a cherry boy (virgin) even at the age of 70

428
00:21:09,700 --> 00:21:13,440
Work hard! Swedish education made him a Cherry boy!

431

Cherry boy

432
00:21:26,360 --> 00:21:27,660
This fits in

433
00:21:27,660 --> 00:21:29,840
This is just miracle

434
00:21:29,840 --> 00:21:30,910
He showed it in order

435
00:21:30,910 --> 00:21:34,190
-Maybe anything fits Sakata-shisho?
-Oh I see, so reversely

436
00:21:34,190 --> 00:21:35,770
Let's try

438
00:21:37,920 --> 00:21:41,720
Never eat Castella cake with soft drink

439
00:21:42,420 --> 00:21:43,740
He's a gourmet

440
00:21:45,540 --> 00:21:49,100
-This must be hilarious if Sakata-shisho said it
-This is awful

441
00:21:49,100 --> 00:21:52,120
-You should look at the photo
-Yeah, he's always facing here

442
00:21:52,120 --> 00:21:53,140
Do it over there

443
00:21:53,140 --> 00:21:55,180
Ah, I see

444
00:21:56,090 --> 00:21:57,880
Sit here Nobu

445
00:21:57,880 --> 00:22:00,300
I'll start from the next page

446
00:22:05,110 --> 00:22:05,900
Let's start

447
00:22:05,900 --> 00:22:07,540
Show us the photo first

448
00:22:08,220 --> 00:22:10,030
Comment on this photo

449
00:22:10,030 --> 00:22:15,190
Let's use this time to make a pleasant sauce

450
00:22:21,920 --> 00:22:23,590
This is amazing

451
00:22:23,590 --> 00:22:25,590
Yeah, it's hilarious

452
00:22:27,040 --> 00:22:27,930
This is awful

453
00:22:27,930 --> 00:22:30,010
We started something awful

454
00:22:30,010 --> 00:22:32,530
Fujimon is in a favorable position

455
00:22:32,530 --> 00:22:35,210
-Yeah, he's in a favorable position
-He's the one performing

456
00:22:35,210 --> 00:22:38,380
Fujimon please watch the photo again and keep it in your mind

457
00:22:42,580 --> 00:22:45,900
Please don't show it this way, we will be in danger too

458
00:22:48,980 --> 00:22:50,780
Please sing us a song

459
00:22:50,780 --> 00:22:52,860
Money/Hamada Shogo

460
00:23:01,250 --> 00:23:02,900
He's not Hamada Shogo though

461
00:23:02,900 --> 00:23:05,200
Another one

462
00:23:05,200 --> 00:23:06,700
Comment on this photo

463
00:23:06,700 --> 00:23:09,730
People call it love

464
00:23:13,040 --> 00:23:14,260
Why is he like this?

465
00:23:14,260 --> 00:23:16,940
Madrid's sun made him like this

466
00:23:16,940 --> 00:23:19,650
In the Spain

467
00:23:19,650 --> 00:23:21,720
In the Spain is not written on there

468
00:23:23,120 --> 00:23:25,150
Do you get it?

469
00:23:25,150 --> 00:23:27,930
He don't use to be like this, it's Madrid's sun that made him like this

470
00:23:27,930 --> 00:23:31,260
Work hard! Swedish education made him a Cherry boy!

471
00:23:32,670 --> 00:23:33,990
Cherry boy

472
00:23:35,240 --> 00:23:36,630
It's Swedish education guys

473
00:23:36,630 --> 00:23:38,730
*Kawakami Maiko is a Swedish-born Japanese actress

474
00:23:36,630 --> 00:23:38,730
Just like Kawakami Maiko

475
00:23:38,730 --> 00:23:40,900
Sweden education

476
00:23:43,120 --> 00:23:45,910
-A gift in return for a funeral offering
-It's his nickname

477
00:23:48,490 --> 00:23:49,980
A gift in return for a funeral offering

478
00:23:49,980 --> 00:23:51,560
Fujimon is always...

479
00:23:51,560 --> 00:23:54,720
Yeah, Fujimon keeps adding extra words

480
00:23:54,720 --> 00:23:56,200
What is your role?

481
00:23:56,200 --> 00:23:58,710
-Like saying it's his nickname...
-I'm his man of virtue

482
00:23:58,710 --> 00:24:00,450
Man of virtue?

483
00:24:02,960 --> 00:24:03,940
Should we write it now?

484
00:24:03,940 --> 00:24:06,000
Yeah, just write it now

485
00:24:06,000 --> 00:24:07,840
Write it now?

486
00:24:07,840 --> 00:24:08,880
Let's write it now

487
00:24:08,880 --> 00:24:10,400
So in real time?

488
00:24:11,220 --> 00:24:11,900
Let's do this

489
00:24:11,900 --> 00:24:13,980
So we can watch it in raw

490
00:24:13,980 --> 00:24:15,990
It's a live

491
00:24:15,990 --> 00:24:18,280
Oogiri live

492
00:24:18,280 --> 00:24:19,610
It's Oogiri live

Wait a second...wait a second...

496
00:24:32,430 --> 00:24:34,330
Wait a second...

497
00:24:34,330 --> 00:24:37,880
Come on, wait a second, this is terrible

498
00:24:37,880 --> 00:24:39,350
You laughed out loud

499
00:24:39,350 --> 00:24:42,190
Oh dear, oh dear...

500
00:24:42,190 --> 00:24:44,190
No, no, that's just my voice

501
00:24:44,190 --> 00:24:46,800
That's my voice

502
00:24:46,800 --> 00:24:48,550
That's just my voice, Matsumoto-san

503
00:24:48,550 --> 00:24:50,370
There's no excuse for that one

504
00:24:50,370 --> 00:24:53,510
Nobu is actually laughing slightly all the time

505
00:24:53,510 --> 00:24:57,530
It's just sooner or later

506
00:24:57,530 --> 00:24:59,050
Well, let's have a look first

507
00:25:00,570 --> 00:25:02,590
-Comment on this photo
-I like you

508
00:25:05,190 --> 00:25:07,500
Nobu!!!

509
00:25:07,500 --> 00:25:11,030
Out!!!

510
00:25:16,030 --> 00:25:18,520
This is just awful, come on

511
00:25:18,520 --> 00:25:21,720
I never thought Nobu will be the first one out

512
00:25:21,720 --> 00:25:23,130
He's the first one

513
00:25:23,130 --> 00:25:25,040
I'm the first one...

514
00:25:25,040 --> 00:25:27,260
So no more chance for the 10 million prize

515
00:25:27,260 --> 00:25:28,900
No more chance

516
00:25:28,900 --> 00:25:30,690
You'll be back as a zombie

517
00:25:30,690 --> 00:25:32,720
Just try hard as a zombie

518
00:25:32,720 --> 00:25:33,950
Yeah, I understand

519
00:25:33,950 --> 00:25:34,840
Nobu zombie

520
00:25:34,840 --> 00:25:37,420
Well, Nobu zombie won't even be interesting right?

521
00:25:39,040 --> 00:25:40,660
Yes, exactly

522
00:25:40,660 --> 00:25:42,840
But that's funny too

523
00:25:42,840 --> 00:25:44,620
In another sense

524
00:25:44,620 --> 00:25:47,790
It's hilarious to see a nervous zombie that is not funny at all

525
00:25:47,790 --> 00:25:50,320
-Nobu let's go
-Yes

526
00:25:50,320 --> 00:25:50,920
Bye Nobu

527
00:25:50,920 --> 00:25:52,950
That was cunning, seriously

528
00:25:52,950 --> 00:25:55,220
-They're pinpointing at me
-Well yeah, indeed

529
00:25:55,220 --> 00:25:56,600
They were somehow targeting Nobu

530
00:25:56,600 --> 00:25:58,820
Bye bye Nobu

531
00:25:58,820 --> 00:26:00,250
I'll be back as a zombie

532
00:26:00,250 --> 00:26:02,250
That zombie must be fine

533
00:26:02,250 --> 00:26:04,550
Nobu zombie must be fine

534
00:26:04,550 --> 00:26:08,300
This is truly embarrassing

535
00:26:08,300 --> 00:26:11,190
But my defense is just too weak

536
00:26:11,190 --> 00:26:13,920
This one was about vasectomy right...

537
00:26:14,860 --> 00:26:16,200
Are these words...

538
00:26:16,200 --> 00:26:17,310
Ka-ha!

539
00:26:17,310 --> 00:26:18,890
Ka-ha?

540
00:26:20,590 --> 00:26:22,960
While there is anxiety in the atmosphere

541
00:26:22,960 --> 00:26:26,010
But on top of that, the atmosphere is absolutely hilarious

542
00:26:26,010 --> 00:26:28,030
-Comment on this photo
-I like you

543
00:26:31,810 --> 00:26:32,780
Wait a second...

544
00:26:33,760 --> 00:26:38,660
It feels like I'm going to burst with the slightest poke by a needle

545
00:26:40,600 --> 00:26:41,620
I'm frustrated

546
00:26:45,890 --> 00:26:47,620
Let's start

547
00:26:49,610 --> 00:26:50,770
It started

548
00:26:50,770 --> 00:26:52,720
There's Sashimi, Kimuchi and meat here

549
00:26:54,380 --> 00:26:55,390
Shall we fry it?

550
00:26:55,390 --> 00:26:57,990
Fry it or call food delivery?

551
00:26:57,990 --> 00:27:00,550
Let's try the foods here, this is a precious chance

552
00:27:00,550 --> 00:27:01,680
So we're going to cook?

553
00:27:01,680 --> 00:27:03,680
That meat is amazing

554
00:27:03,680 --> 00:27:04,870
Please fry it

555
00:27:04,870 --> 00:27:06,800
-Miyazako-san is good at cooking right?
-Yeah

556
00:27:06,800 --> 00:27:08,440
Anyone want some apple juice?

557
00:27:08,440 --> 00:27:09,420
Ah, I want some

558
00:27:09,420 --> 00:27:11,550
Do it yourself dude! You're just a junior, you idiot

559
00:27:11,550 --> 00:27:14,680
Ah, I'm sorry, I didn't expect this

560
00:27:14,680 --> 00:27:16,000
Just drink some milk

561
00:27:16,000 --> 00:27:18,000
Ah, may I?

562
00:27:18,000 --> 00:27:20,670
-Is there milk?
-Let Daigo see how you drink milk

563
00:27:20,670 --> 00:27:22,840
(Eh, Daigo?)

564
00:27:22,840 --> 00:27:24,350
Wait a second...

565
00:27:24,350 --> 00:27:25,210
You said it right?

566
00:27:25,210 --> 00:27:28,540
Well, I just asked him to drink some milk in front of everyone

567
00:27:28,540 --> 00:27:30,840
Will your beard be stained?

568
00:27:30,840 --> 00:27:33,100
No, it won't

569
00:27:33,100 --> 00:27:35,840
-Ah, wait a second Kurochan
-Yes?

570
00:27:36,570 --> 00:27:37,320
Huh?

571
00:27:37,320 --> 00:27:42,350
-You asked him to drink some milk right?
-Yes, I asked him to drink some milk, but in front of everyone

572
00:27:42,350 --> 00:27:44,100
No, you didn't say in front of everyone

573
00:27:44,100 --> 00:27:46,620
Daigo asked you to drink it, so show it to Daigo

574
00:27:46,620 --> 00:27:47,400
May I drink it?

575
00:27:47,400 --> 00:27:50,560
Your beard will be stained if you chug it

576
00:27:50,560 --> 00:27:51,470
Stained with milk

577
00:27:51,470 --> 00:27:52,860
No it won't be stained

578
00:27:52,860 --> 00:27:53,700
I'll drink it now

579
00:27:53,700 --> 00:27:54,790
Chug it

580
00:27:55,660 --> 00:27:57,310
It must be stained

581
00:28:03,400 --> 00:28:04,960
It's leaking in the same way

582
00:28:04,960 --> 00:28:06,930
It's really not stained

583
00:28:08,670 --> 00:28:10,840
It's leaking from that side every time

584
00:28:10,840 --> 00:28:12,020
Drink it one more time

585
00:28:12,020 --> 00:28:13,820
Ah, may I?

586
00:28:13,820 --> 00:28:15,850
Ah, okay

587
00:28:16,270 --> 00:28:18,240
It will definitely be stained this time

588
00:28:19,330 --> 00:28:20,850
Yeah, it must be stained

589
00:28:30,590 --> 00:28:32,360
Don't make that face

590
00:28:34,940 --> 00:28:36,930
(Of course it will be stained)

591
00:28:36,930 --> 00:28:38,660
(How much is he drinking?)

592
00:28:38,660 --> 00:28:40,600
It's making the sound of a drain

593
00:28:44,610 --> 00:28:46,500
Can you not talk about the sound of a drain now?

594
00:28:46,500 --> 00:28:48,500
But it made the sound "Kobo-kobo" like a drain

595
00:28:48,500 --> 00:28:49,620
What are you talking about?

596
00:28:49,620 --> 00:28:52,670
-Don't drink it anymore
-Why?

597
00:28:53,500 --> 00:28:55,270
-You're gonna be stuffed
-Yeah

598
00:28:55,270 --> 00:28:56,840
Shall we fry it?

599
00:28:56,840 --> 00:28:59,450
-Yes, please
-Really?

600
00:28:59,450 --> 00:29:01,250
-I'll just fry it then
-Yes

601
00:29:01,250 --> 00:29:03,710
Can this even be fried though?

602
00:29:03,710 --> 00:29:05,140
Maybe cut it into pieces?

603
00:29:05,140 --> 00:29:06,710
This is amazing

604
00:29:06,710 --> 00:29:07,460
This is thick

605
00:29:07,460 --> 00:29:09,460
Wow, barbecue

606
00:29:10,410 --> 00:29:11,630
This is so thick

607
00:29:11,630 --> 00:29:13,980
Maybe we can even deep fry it?

608
00:29:13,980 --> 00:29:15,500
The show is gonna end by then

609
00:29:15,500 --> 00:29:19,660
-Maybe we can just focus on cooking and make this a gourmet show
-No way

610
00:29:30,520 --> 00:29:31,640
What happened?

611
00:29:33,610 --> 00:29:35,330
He's angry because his cloth is stained

612
00:29:35,330 --> 00:29:36,670
It's stained with meat juice

613
00:29:36,670 --> 00:29:37,990
You're being overly concerned

614
00:29:37,990 --> 00:29:42,400
-But my jacket is stained with meat juice
-Who cares

615
00:29:42,720 --> 00:29:44,980
Is that an expensive jacket?

616
00:29:52,430 --> 00:29:54,550
I just asked you is that an expensive jacket?

617
00:29:54,550 --> 00:29:57,630
Because you seem to be so concerned about it

618
00:29:57,810 --> 00:29:59,370
Is there any wet towel?

619
00:29:59,370 --> 00:30:00,570
Let's make one

620
00:30:00,570 --> 00:30:04,720
Hey no, I just thought you shouldn't care about your cloth today

621
00:30:04,720 --> 00:30:06,250
Let me do a Thunder

622
00:30:06,250 --> 00:30:07,840
Please don't do a Thunder

623
00:30:07,840 --> 00:30:09,390
A Thunder?

624
00:30:09,390 --> 00:30:11,070
What is a Thunder?

625
00:30:11,070 --> 00:30:12,700
Miyazako-san, please stop that

626
00:30:13,520 --> 00:30:16,720
I'm the one who is frying the steak for everyone

627
00:30:16,720 --> 00:30:21,780
I know you're wearing expensive cloth,
but just don't be overly concerned...

628
00:30:21,780 --> 00:30:24,510
-What's a Thunder?
-Show me your back

629
00:30:24,510 --> 00:30:26,880
-No, wait, please...
-You can keep your clothes on

630
00:30:26,880 --> 00:30:29,210
You can keep your clothes on, so just stay still

631
00:30:29,210 --> 00:30:30,840
You can keep your clothes on

632
00:30:30,840 --> 00:30:33,610
It's fine, just keep your clothes on

633
00:30:33,610 --> 00:30:35,770
Just stand over here

634
00:30:35,770 --> 00:30:41,100
-You should never talk to your seniors like this
-Yeah, I know, but...

635
00:30:41,100 --> 00:30:43,480
Just stay still in this angle

636
00:30:43,480 --> 00:30:46,030
-Miyazako-san, please don't, seriously...
-This is scary

637
00:30:47,920 --> 00:30:50,950
OUCH!

638
00:30:52,760 --> 00:30:54,320
He's crying

639
00:30:54,320 --> 00:30:56,900
I never saw Fujimon look like that

640
00:30:56,900 --> 00:30:59,660
And he's an adult

641
00:30:59,660 --> 00:31:01,040
Even above his cloth

642
00:31:01,040 --> 00:31:02,670
That's because you complained

643
00:31:02,670 --> 00:31:05,620
I'm the senior and I'm cooking for you guys

644
00:31:05,620 --> 00:31:06,360
Yes, you're right

645
00:31:06,360 --> 00:31:08,820
But he's just overly concerned about it

646
00:31:08,820 --> 00:31:10,300
You're still talking about it?

647
00:31:10,300 --> 00:31:14,590
Well, but Miyazako-san always try to act cool right?

648
00:31:17,630 --> 00:31:19,220
Sit here

649
00:31:20,240 --> 00:31:21,060
Just sit here

650
00:31:21,060 --> 00:31:23,360
-What are you going to do?
-Just sit here

651
00:31:23,360 --> 00:31:26,230
Why are you always talking things like that?

652
00:31:26,230 --> 00:31:29,330
It's inappropriate to say those things

653
00:31:35,060 --> 00:31:36,630
That is so scary

654
00:31:36,630 --> 00:31:38,780
That must hurt so badly

655
00:31:38,780 --> 00:31:41,130
-That's scary
-Oh, no

656
00:31:42,200 --> 00:31:43,100
Come on, Fujimon-san

657
00:31:44,160 --> 00:31:46,560
He's gonna be punished again

658
00:31:59,620 --> 00:32:01,470
He's cute, like a cat

659
00:32:07,310 --> 00:32:08,930
Because you glared at him right?

660
00:32:08,930 --> 00:32:10,930
That's your fault

661
00:32:13,370 --> 00:32:14,490
Fujimon-san...

662
00:32:14,490 --> 00:32:16,490
Please stop this

663
00:32:16,490 --> 00:32:18,910
Both are you are seniors, please stop this...

664
00:32:22,770 --> 00:32:25,750
-That's dangerous
-That must hurt so badly

665
00:32:53,130 --> 00:32:58,540
Well done for holding on

666
00:33:00,160 --> 00:33:02,560
Ku-chan was close though

667
00:33:04,790 --> 00:33:06,730
Thank you

668
00:33:06,730 --> 00:33:08,660
-I'll fry it for everyone
-Thank you

669
00:33:08,660 --> 00:33:10,440
-They made up
-Thank you

670
00:33:10,440 --> 00:33:14,190
Were you two used to performing like this as juniors?

671
00:33:14,190 --> 00:33:16,570
Well, yeah...

672
00:33:16,570 --> 00:33:18,620
We used to perform like this

673
00:33:19,180 --> 00:33:19,950
I miss those days

674
00:33:19,950 --> 00:33:23,600
But some of my bones are dislocated because of this

675
00:33:23,600 --> 00:33:25,600
He's sometime sadistic right?

676
00:33:25,600 --> 00:33:28,180
Towards comedians and towards women

677
00:33:28,180 --> 00:33:30,440
Women as well?

678
00:33:33,540 --> 00:33:35,590
He does those things to women as well?

679
00:33:35,590 --> 00:33:36,610
I thought he's kind

680
00:33:36,610 --> 00:33:38,740
Yes, he sure is kind

681
00:33:38,740 --> 00:33:41,410
But I mean...

682
00:33:41,410 --> 00:33:42,930
When he's on the bed

683
00:33:42,930 --> 00:33:45,400
Eh?

684
00:33:45,400 --> 00:33:48,380
So you're talking like that again?

685
00:33:50,680 --> 00:33:53,390
My child is already in high school

686
00:33:54,140 --> 00:33:56,200
Saying those things is inappropriate

687
00:33:56,200 --> 00:33:57,080
Sorry, I'm just joking

688
00:33:57,080 --> 00:34:00,060
Who's mouth said that?

689
00:34:00,060 --> 00:34:01,020
No, please, I'm sorry

690
00:34:01,020 --> 00:34:01,790
Who's mouth said that?

691
00:34:01,790 --> 00:34:05,120
-I just thought it's interesting
-This mouth said that right?

692
00:34:09,680 --> 00:34:10,730
Directly?

693
00:34:12,030 --> 00:34:13,250
Directly?

694
00:34:15,860 --> 00:34:18,040
It's seriously gonna be dislocated

695
00:34:31,660 --> 00:34:34,810
That's because you're saying those things

696
00:34:34,810 --> 00:34:38,970
But it really hurts

697
00:34:40,390 --> 00:34:43,330
It really hurts so badly

698
00:34:43,330 --> 00:34:45,000
For real?

699
00:34:45,000 --> 00:34:48,340
Yes, for real

700
00:34:49,160 --> 00:34:51,600
It really hurts so badly?

701
00:34:51,600 --> 00:34:55,210
If he push a bit harder, it will be dislocated

702
00:34:55,210 --> 00:34:57,850
-Dislocated?
-Yes, it's gonna come out

703
00:34:57,850 --> 00:35:00,140
Like in Mask?

704
00:35:00,140 --> 00:35:01,210
The movie Mask

705
00:35:01,210 --> 00:35:06,220
But what should you say at the first moment when it comes back

706
00:35:06,220 --> 00:35:08,400
Yeah, I wonder what to say

707
00:35:08,400 --> 00:35:11,810
When it stretches and come back, a lot of skin will stay here right?

708
00:35:11,810 --> 00:35:14,410
So what should you say at the first moment when it comes back?

709
00:35:14,410 --> 00:35:16,720
Are you asking me to do Oogiri dude

710
00:35:16,720 --> 00:35:18,700
Because we're talking about this

711
00:35:20,120 --> 00:35:23,080
Please leave me alone

712
00:35:23,080 --> 00:35:26,410
When your jaw dislocates and reaches the ground, what would you say at the first moment when it comes back?

713
00:35:26,410 --> 00:35:29,510
The Silver Pavilion

714
00:35:32,180 --> 00:35:34,420
What does that mean?

715
00:35:35,340 --> 00:35:38,290
When your jaw dislocates and reaches the ground, what would you say at the first moment when it comes back?

716
00:35:38,290 --> 00:35:39,180
I like you

717
00:35:44,650 --> 00:35:48,970
-It's dangerous to hear that sizzling sound after "I like you"
-That was a perfect combination

718
00:35:48,970 --> 00:35:51,330
(That was a really good one though)

719
00:35:54,830 --> 00:35:57,470
That's amazing

720
00:35:58,940 --> 00:36:01,530
Would it be fine to have it rare?

721
00:36:01,530 --> 00:36:03,530
This should be fine, I'll flip it

722
00:36:06,530 --> 00:36:08,010
-That's amazing
-Looking good

723
00:36:08,010 --> 00:36:10,550
-Is there any butter
-Oh, yeah

724
00:36:10,550 --> 00:36:13,330
Have a look

725
00:36:13,330 --> 00:36:15,560
-But I think I saw some spices inside
-Really?

726
00:36:15,560 --> 00:36:18,160
Like some seasonings

727
00:37:17,210 --> 00:37:19,490
This is thrilling

728
00:37:22,990 --> 00:37:25,320
This is so thrilling

729
00:38:44,230 --> 00:38:48,520
There was some eggshells inside

730
00:38:48,520 --> 00:38:49,870
Eggshells?

731
00:38:49,870 --> 00:38:51,840
There's eggshells?

732
00:38:51,840 --> 00:38:54,830
Oh, I see

733
00:38:57,850 --> 00:39:01,220
-So you're puking because of eggshells?
-Yes

734
00:39:08,970 --> 00:39:10,940
I'm using too much

735
00:39:12,950 --> 00:39:15,410
I used so much towels

736
00:39:19,000 --> 00:39:19,910
I feel gross

737
00:39:25,460 --> 00:39:27,540
It was so spicy...

738
00:39:52,000 --> 00:39:53,950
These are incontinence pads

739
00:40:07,790 --> 00:40:10,920
(Is Kurochan going to do this?)

740
00:40:10,920 --> 00:40:12,130
Are you ok?

741
00:40:12,130 --> 00:40:13,000
OUCH

742
00:40:34,980 --> 00:40:35,920
Huh, Iio?

743
00:40:55,290 --> 00:40:56,970
Iio laughed right?

744
00:41:08,100 --> 00:41:10,180
Eh, who is it?

745
00:41:10,180 --> 00:41:12,350
-Who laughed?
-No, I didn't

746
00:41:20,710 --> 00:41:22,800
Well, it's Iio

747
00:41:22,800 --> 00:41:24,440
-Eh?
-He laughed

748
00:41:24,440 --> 00:41:26,900
-Eh?
-Really?

749
00:41:34,050 --> 00:41:36,710
He definitely laughed right?

750
00:41:36,710 --> 00:41:39,310
He laughed right?

751
00:41:39,310 --> 00:41:42,300
I just went "Hu-wa" because of the sliminess

752
00:41:42,300 --> 00:41:47,300
-So you laughed at the sliminess right?
-Well yes, I laughed at the sliminess

753
00:41:47,300 --> 00:41:53,560
-The sliminess was just absolutely awful
-Well, I have to give you an orange card

754
00:41:53,560 --> 00:41:56,620
Ah, I shouldn't have put it in my mouth

755
00:41:56,620 --> 00:42:01,130
-So Iio will be out next time too
-Ah, come on

756
00:42:01,130 --> 00:42:02,650
Ah, I'm sorry

757
00:42:02,650 --> 00:42:04,340
I can't believe you put that in your mouth

758
00:42:04,340 --> 00:42:10,200
What I found the most difficult to hold back was during the Oogiri

759
00:42:10,200 --> 00:42:13,570
The sizzling sound went "Jyuwa"

760
00:42:14,490 --> 00:42:17,460
When your jaw dislocates and reaches the ground, what would you say at the first moment when it comes back?

761
00:42:17,460 --> 00:42:20,090
I like you

762
00:42:24,070 --> 00:42:27,910
-It's awful to hear that sizzling sound after "I like you"
-That was a perfect combination

763
00:42:28,120 --> 00:42:31,200
(That was a really good one though)

764
00:42:31,200 --> 00:42:33,140
It's amazing for you all to hold back on that one

765
00:42:33,140 --> 00:42:35,390
That was hilarious though

766
00:42:35,390 --> 00:42:39,100
-Well done for holding on
-It made a fierce sound right?

767
00:42:39,100 --> 00:42:40,720
Yeah, all of a sudden

768
00:42:40,720 --> 00:42:43,180
-And went like "Jyuwa"
-That was amazing

769
00:42:47,540 --> 00:42:49,880
Let's start

770
00:42:52,880 --> 00:42:55,520
Ah, so that's why you laughed just now

771
00:42:55,520 --> 00:42:58,320
I bet he is doing that...

772
00:42:58,320 --> 00:43:00,780
-Yeah, he's doing that...
-Sure he his

773
00:43:00,780 --> 00:43:03,330
Wait a second, Ku-chan, please...

774
00:43:07,990 --> 00:43:10,280
This is awful

775
00:43:10,280 --> 00:43:12,350
This is absolutely awful

776
00:43:17,670 --> 00:43:19,950
Ku-chan, the steak is almost ready

777
00:43:32,420 --> 00:43:36,730
Who are you?

778
00:43:36,730 --> 00:43:38,680
Yamamoto Shinya

779
00:43:43,170 --> 00:43:45,870
-Yamamoto Shinya?
-The director

780
00:43:45,870 --> 00:43:48,640
The director?

781
00:43:48,640 --> 00:43:55,720
I told you I'm Yamamoto Shinya, so I am Yamamoto Shinya

782
00:43:58,090 --> 00:43:59,930
He can't talk with that denture?

783
00:43:59,930 --> 00:44:03,050
-It's difficult to talk wearing that
-It's difficult to talk?

784
00:44:04,340 --> 00:44:08,520
Do Yamamoto Shinya director have those protruding teeth?

785
00:44:08,520 --> 00:44:10,420
He don't have protruding teeth

786
00:44:10,420 --> 00:44:12,030
He's not that white

787
00:44:12,030 --> 00:44:15,520
And he's not that bald

788
00:44:23,720 --> 00:44:26,950
Hey you, don't fry it with a delightful face

789
00:44:35,940 --> 00:44:38,790
Please excuse me

790
00:44:49,070 --> 00:44:51,330
Excuse me

791
00:44:56,570 --> 00:44:59,430
What brought you here?

792
00:44:59,430 --> 00:45:01,580
Looking good...

793
00:45:01,580 --> 00:45:03,180
Looking good...

794
00:45:03,180 --> 00:45:05,660
I'm here for site inspection

795
00:45:06,580 --> 00:45:09,520
Please excuse me

796
00:45:10,250 --> 00:45:14,260
I'm looking for cool locations

797
00:45:14,260 --> 00:45:16,700
And cool locations are looking for me

798
00:45:16,700 --> 00:45:20,420
He's director for sure

799
00:45:24,340 --> 00:45:25,840
Are you filming a movie now?

800
00:45:27,520 --> 00:45:30,240
-Please excuse me...
-Can you stop putting it there?

801
00:45:30,240 --> 00:45:32,650
Don't put it on other's head

802
00:45:32,650 --> 00:45:34,650
Please stop it

803
00:45:35,200 --> 00:45:36,570
You understand me?

804
00:45:36,570 --> 00:45:38,570
I'm sorry

805
00:45:42,150 --> 00:45:43,980
I'll put it this on

806
00:45:49,480 --> 00:45:50,680
Please excuse me

807
00:45:52,730 --> 00:45:54,090
He's being considerate

808
00:45:55,330 --> 00:45:58,310
That's much better than putting it directly

809
00:45:59,080 --> 00:46:00,360
No dude

810
00:46:03,050 --> 00:46:04,810
Let's eat the steak

811
00:46:05,520 --> 00:46:07,760
Eh? You're staying here?

812
00:46:07,760 --> 00:46:10,570
You're gonna stay here like this?

813
00:46:10,570 --> 00:46:12,650
Seriously?

814
00:46:16,870 --> 00:46:17,730
Hey, Iio-san

815
00:46:17,730 --> 00:46:19,960
-Yes?
-Look at him

816
00:46:19,960 --> 00:46:22,610
Director is here, so face him

817
00:46:22,610 --> 00:46:23,670
No please, Fujimon-san

818
00:46:23,670 --> 00:46:24,700
No listen to me...

819
00:46:24,700 --> 00:46:29,530
Fujimon-san, are you able to eat with him?

820
00:46:32,990 --> 00:46:34,180
Let's eat together

821
00:46:35,310 --> 00:46:37,020
Miyazako-san...

822
00:46:37,020 --> 00:46:39,870
Please just take the steak here...I can't take this anymore...

823
00:46:42,860 --> 00:46:44,190
What happened?

824
00:46:44,190 --> 00:46:47,580
You're finding it difficult to wear the denture right?

825
00:46:47,580 --> 00:46:50,180
Because of the moisture...

826
00:46:50,180 --> 00:46:53,260
It's absorbing the moisture...

827
00:46:54,010 --> 00:46:56,000
What did you say?

828
00:46:56,000 --> 00:46:58,670
The denture...

829
00:46:58,670 --> 00:47:01,490
The moisture...

830
00:47:01,490 --> 00:47:09,480
The moisture swelled it up

831
00:47:51,500 --> 00:47:55,530
He's so mean

832
00:47:59,390 --> 00:48:03,010
You need to take off the denture to eat it

833
00:48:03,470 --> 00:48:06,460
He's so mean

834
00:48:24,260 --> 00:48:25,210
This is just...

835
00:48:33,630 --> 00:48:35,770
That was so long

836
00:48:39,430 --> 00:48:41,790
Are you okay Daigo?

837
00:48:43,900 --> 00:48:47,580
Oh my god, that was just awful

838
00:48:48,170 --> 00:48:49,870
Damn it

839
00:48:49,870 --> 00:48:54,260
-That was close
-He didn't eat it at all

840
00:48:54,260 --> 00:48:58,000
Ah, I'm so tired

841
00:48:58,000 --> 00:49:01,800
I'm so tired too

842
00:49:01,800 --> 00:49:05,300
He didn't eat it at all

843
00:49:05,300 --> 00:49:08,020
Everyone was close though

844
00:49:08,020 --> 00:49:10,080
How did you hold back on that?

845
00:49:10,080 --> 00:49:14,060
-He was actually too close, so I can't see his face clearly
-No man, that was awful

846
00:49:14,060 --> 00:49:18,040
That's the distance between Sigourney Weaver and alien

847
00:49:18,040 --> 00:49:19,920
It's like in Alien 2

848
00:49:19,920 --> 00:49:22,400
Yeah, the distance in Alien 2

849
00:49:22,400 --> 00:49:26,050
Well, Miyazako-san saved you all

850
00:49:26,050 --> 00:49:29,060
That anxious atmosphere has never been seen before

851
00:49:29,060 --> 00:49:30,810
Let's have a look

852
00:49:30,810 --> 00:49:33,670
-That was impossible to hold back
-Yeah, that's impossible

853
00:49:53,300 --> 00:49:56,140
Come on

854
00:49:56,140 --> 00:49:58,990
That's impossible

855
00:49:58,990 --> 00:50:03,320
So the first card for Miyazako, yellow card
