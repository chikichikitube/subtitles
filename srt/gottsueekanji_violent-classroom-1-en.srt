00:00:00,310 --> 00:00:03,750
VIOLENT CLASSROOM

3
00:00:04,950 --> 00:00:09,860
And then... he asked me to forgive him
because he has to lick my shoe.

4
00:00:14,130 --> 00:00:16,560
Hey idiot!

5
00:00:16,560 --> 00:00:20,500
When I do this, you need to give me a cigarette!

6
00:00:20,500 --> 00:00:21,870
I'm sorry! I'm sorry!

7
00:00:22,800 --> 00:00:23,840
What you doing?

8
00:00:25,040 --> 00:00:25,840
Light!

9
00:00:25,970 --> 00:00:27,470
Give me a light!

10
00:00:30,940 --> 00:00:32,610
Do you really have balls?

11
00:00:37,520 --> 00:00:39,520
The bell saved your life, huh.

12
00:00:42,590 --> 00:00:44,690
what are you doing?
- Sorry!

13
00:00:45,920 --> 00:00:48,330
Good morning everyone.

14
00:00:49,390 --> 00:00:53,870
Before starting class, I have some
information to tell everyone.

15
00:00:53,870 --> 00:00:56,030
Your chronic hemorrhoid got worse?

16
00:00:58,900 --> 00:01:01,110
Yeah that's right, so what.

17
00:01:06,240 --> 00:01:07,910
What are you talking about?

18
00:01:07,910 --> 00:01:09,710
I'm sorry. I'm sorry.

19
00:01:09,750 --> 00:01:13,390
I have your new friend here.

20
00:01:13,390 --> 00:01:17,160
Transferring from another school,
Hamada Masatoshi-kun.

21
00:01:21,030 --> 00:01:22,590
Please introduce yourself.

22
00:01:24,730 --> 00:01:26,030
I'm Hamada.

23
00:01:26,670 --> 00:01:30,840
What's with this guy, looks like he doesn't have any balls!

24
00:01:33,710 --> 00:01:41,510
Hamada-kun if you need any information
ask Shinohara, he is the class president.

25
00:01:41,850 --> 00:01:43,750
Take an empty seat.

26
00:01:52,220 --> 00:01:54,490
What the hell are you doing?

27
00:01:54,490 --> 00:01:58,060
You're pretty brave, huh?

28
00:01:59,500 --> 00:02:02,000
Boss give him a slap!

29
00:02:04,100 --> 00:02:08,870
He has a little small mole right here.

30
00:02:12,810 --> 00:02:14,210
Come here.

31
00:02:15,480 --> 00:02:17,920
Stop it! Stop it you two!

32
00:02:21,590 --> 00:02:23,320
Get over there!
- Yes.

33
00:02:23,620 --> 00:02:24,820
Look at this.

34
00:02:24,820 --> 00:02:29,390
You guys don't interfere with this fight.

35
00:02:29,390 --> 00:02:30,660
Yes boss!

36
00:02:30,660 --> 00:02:32,700
This is how you...

37
00:02:34,030 --> 00:02:35,570
...fight.

38
00:02:44,340 --> 00:02:47,280
Boss!

39
00:02:49,150 --> 00:02:50,280
Wait...

40
00:02:53,420 --> 00:02:54,890
Wait a minute!

41
00:02:56,490 --> 00:02:59,020
Why do you have a winner's face?

42
00:03:02,990 --> 00:03:04,100
Boss!

43
00:03:04,100 --> 00:03:05,160
Wait a minute!

44
00:03:06,000 --> 00:03:07,970
What kind of face is that?

45
00:03:09,230 --> 00:03:10,770
A one vs one fight is...

46
00:03:11,270 --> 00:03:12,640
like this!

47
00:03:14,440 --> 00:03:25,280
Boss! Boss!

48
00:03:26,450 --> 00:03:27,850
What the hell!

49
00:03:28,050 --> 00:03:30,220
You guys help...

50
00:03:32,060 --> 00:03:33,730
You guys don't help me.

51
00:03:33,730 --> 00:03:34,390
Yes boss!

52
00:03:34,790 --> 00:03:35,760
Never mind.

53
00:03:36,830 --> 00:03:37,700
Today...

54
00:03:38,400 --> 00:03:41,970
because of these guys... I'll let it go... but...

55
00:03:42,570 --> 00:03:43,240
Next...

56
00:03:46,540 --> 00:03:48,370
What are you doing?

57
00:03:50,380 --> 00:03:56,210
Boss!

58
00:04:11,260 --> 00:04:13,030
He said not to help.

59
00:04:14,000 --> 00:04:15,770
That was hard.
