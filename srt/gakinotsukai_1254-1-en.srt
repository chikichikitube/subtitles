00:00:01,630 --> 00:00:03,830
Shibaken's Golf Course

3
00:00:04,130 --> 00:00:06,530
This time's Gaki no Tsukai

4
00:00:06,530 --> 00:00:09,930
Endo is giving the members a golf lesson

5
00:00:10,430 --> 00:00:11,730
Can you two do it?

6
00:00:11,860 --> 00:00:13,130
Today, I really...

7
00:00:12,200 --> 00:00:13,190
Hmm, I wonder

8
00:00:13,230 --> 00:00:14,700
We're doing the whole course you know

9
00:00:14,500 --> 00:00:16,130
That's really big

10
00:00:15,600 --> 00:00:18,000
Yea, so can you two really do it

11
00:00:18,030 --> 00:00:20,000
It's not among the things I can't do

12
00:00:22,600 --> 00:00:24,100
Today, I...

13
00:00:23,500 --> 00:00:26,360
Maybe we should go to the Osaka mini golf course

14
00:00:26,360 --> 00:00:27,530
Good morning

15
00:00:27,600 --> 00:00:28,160
Good morning

16
00:00:28,200 --> 00:00:29,260
Yes, yes, yes

17
00:00:29,100 --> 00:00:29,800
Mornin

18
00:00:30,430 --> 00:00:32,560
Today we're playing golf, aren't we?

19
00:00:32,330 --> 00:00:33,060
So it seems

20
00:00:32,500 --> 00:00:33,860
Yes, do your best

21
00:00:32,600 --> 00:00:33,000
Yes

22
00:00:34,000 --> 00:00:35,360
Well, then, uhm

23
00:00:35,360 --> 00:00:37,360
There may be a mistake, but I'm not sure

24
00:00:37,360 --> 00:00:39,360
But Matsumoto-San's clothes

25
00:00:39,360 --> 00:00:40,660
Are female

26
00:00:40,660 --> 00:00:42,130
They seem to be young girls'

27
00:00:42,600 --> 00:00:44,460
There's no way that's true

28
00:00:43,860 --> 00:00:44,760
No, it's true

29
00:00:44,760 --> 00:00:47,200
When I asked him if it was OK, well

30
00:00:47,430 --> 00:00:49,400
Matsumoto-San said that

31
00:00:49,430 --> 00:00:51,830
It doesn't matter if I wear girly clothes

32
00:00:51,330 --> 00:00:52,760
Wait, that's bad

33
00:00:52,900 --> 00:00:54,300
Is what he seemed to say

34
00:00:54,300 --> 00:00:56,500
However, he said that

35
00:00:56,760 --> 00:00:58,100
For his underwear

36
00:00:58,100 --> 00:01:00,100
He wished we wouldn't look at them

37
00:01:01,530 --> 00:01:02,430
Underwear?

38
00:01:02,230 --> 00:01:03,460
No, why would we look?

39
00:01:03,360 --> 00:01:05,160
Well, of course we wouldn't do that

40
00:01:05,260 --> 00:01:08,330
It's not really a problem, why would we look

41
00:01:06,200 --> 00:01:08,700
Of course, I wouldn't have a reason to look either

42
00:01:09,030 --> 00:01:11,460
Should we start going then? The weather is a bit iffy

43
00:01:09,960 --> 00:01:11,200
Let's go then

44
00:01:11,600 --> 00:01:12,560
Follow Endo then?

45
00:01:12,560 --> 00:01:12,860
Yes

46
00:01:12,860 --> 00:01:16,500
Despite the happening, by Matsumoto's kindness

47
00:01:16,500 --> 00:01:19,330
As long as they don't look at his underwear

48
00:01:19,330 --> 00:01:21,630
They can continue the shoot

49
00:01:21,630 --> 00:01:23,630
For the first time on Gaki no Tsukai Ya Arehende ChikiChiki!!

50
00:01:23,630 --> 00:01:26,760
Endo's golf lesson

51
00:01:28,100 --> 00:01:29,160
Let's get started then

52
00:01:29,160 --> 00:01:31,530
Well then, I thought that I would

53
00:01:31,530 --> 00:01:33,530
Give everyone a golf lesson

54
00:01:33,530 --> 00:01:35,600
Well then, Tanaka, have you golfed before?

55
00:01:38,400 --> 00:01:39,530
Well...

56
00:01:39,530 --> 00:01:40,830
Have I huh... Well

57
00:01:40,630 --> 00:01:43,930
I haven't heard of you ever playing before

58
00:01:46,060 --> 00:01:48,360
Before the shooting of the golf episode

59
00:01:48,360 --> 00:01:50,230
Matsumoto is troubled with

60
00:01:50,230 --> 00:01:52,030
By having to wear women's clothing

61
00:01:53,000 --> 00:01:54,560
By Matsumoto's kindness

62
00:01:54,560 --> 00:01:56,560
And by not looking at his underwear

63
00:01:56,560 --> 00:01:58,560
They start recording

64
00:01:58,900 --> 00:02:00,930
For the first time on Gaki No Tsukai Ya Arehende ChikiChiki!!

65
00:02:00,930 --> 00:02:03,800
Endo's golf lesson

66
00:02:06,860 --> 00:02:10,260
I wonder, if it's ok to do this for 30 minutes?

67
00:02:10,260 --> 00:02:10,860
Really

68
00:02:10,630 --> 00:02:13,400
Yea, well, from now on I'll be teaching you guys

69
00:02:13,330 --> 00:02:14,030
Hmm

70
00:02:14,030 --> 00:02:15,630
Is it too cold?

71
00:02:14,160 --> 00:02:16,760
Well, well, they've never played before

72
00:02:15,730 --> 00:02:17,530
Well, yes, yes, yes

73
00:02:16,600 --> 00:02:18,300
Today really...

74
00:02:17,400 --> 00:02:19,860
Without the jackets, it's cold

75
00:02:18,900 --> 00:02:20,360
Well, we'll be cold while playing, huh

76
00:02:19,760 --> 00:02:20,530
So it seems

77
00:02:19,960 --> 00:02:20,760
So it seems

78
00:02:20,760 --> 00:02:22,160
It's pretty cold

79
00:02:20,760 --> 00:02:22,160
it's pretty cold, huh

80
00:02:22,160 --> 00:02:27,130
Well, I'd like to give you guys a golf lesson

81
00:02:27,130 --> 00:02:29,360
Ehh, well how are you at golf, Tanaka?

82
00:02:33,230 --> 00:02:34,560
Goooolllff...

83
00:02:34,560 --> 00:02:36,200
Right, well, well

84
00:02:35,500 --> 00:02:38,200
Well, I've never heard of Tanaka playing golf before

85
00:02:38,600 --> 00:02:40,530
But, as of now, you do a little

86
00:02:40,530 --> 00:02:42,530
For work, we'll go golf now and then

87
00:02:42,530 --> 00:02:44,600
We go to the golf course together

88
00:02:43,530 --> 00:02:44,830
Yes, that's right, but I

89
00:02:44,830 --> 00:02:46,830
But you haven't ever have you?

90
00:02:45,060 --> 00:02:46,730
But I've never actually swung a club

91
00:02:46,730 --> 00:02:48,500
I'm wondering if Yama-Chan can golf

92
00:02:48,260 --> 00:02:51,660
In Yamaguan he played a lot of golf

93
00:02:49,900 --> 00:02:50,900
He plays?

94
00:02:51,230 --> 00:02:52,600
I did, huh

95
00:02:52,030 --> 00:02:53,800
You were pretty terrible, huh

96
00:02:53,400 --> 00:02:54,960
Yea, I was really bad

97
00:02:53,900 --> 00:02:56,200
Yea, but you can still play, like a round at Suishou

98
00:02:56,200 --> 00:02:57,360
That's true

99
00:02:56,230 --> 00:02:57,300
That's right

100
00:02:57,360 --> 00:02:59,260
That's right, everyone could probably play at Shuishou

101
00:02:59,260 --> 00:03:01,260
Although I've never been

102
00:03:01,000 --> 00:03:01,860
That's true

103
00:03:01,530 --> 00:03:03,400
Matsumoto, you also haven't, have you?

104
00:03:02,760 --> 00:03:04,460
No, actually, I played a lot

105
00:03:04,460 --> 00:03:06,260
Really, however many times

106
00:03:06,260 --> 00:03:09,300
I'm not sure where, but we both played a lot in Hokakoma

107
00:03:09,300 --> 00:03:11,330
However times you tried

108
00:03:11,330 --> 00:03:12,030
You really did

109
00:03:12,030 --> 00:03:16,160
You didn't know that the hole had a flag in it

110
00:03:16,160 --> 00:03:17,800
You mean like that one

111
00:03:17,230 --> 00:03:18,530
Right, right, right

112
00:03:18,530 --> 00:03:20,730
You really thought there wasn't a hole

113
00:03:21,100 --> 00:03:22,100
Ahh, I did that

114
00:03:22,100 --> 00:03:23,500
Before the lesson

115
00:03:23,500 --> 00:03:24,730
To prevent injury

116
00:03:24,730 --> 00:03:26,730
They begin by stretching

117
00:03:27,600 --> 00:03:29,160
Let's start with the wrist

118
00:03:29,160 --> 00:03:29,730
Various: Yes

119
00:03:30,130 --> 00:03:31,000
Let's start

120
00:03:32,360 --> 00:03:33,500
Now let's do the ankles

121
00:03:35,000 --> 00:03:37,530
With golf you really use your whole body

122
00:03:37,660 --> 00:03:38,160
Huh

123
00:03:38,430 --> 00:03:39,800
Alright then, let's start

124
00:03:39,800 --> 00:03:41,800
With the inner thighs then

125
00:03:41,830 --> 00:03:42,700
Inner thighs

126
00:03:42,700 --> 00:03:44,600
Yea, well, it's more the hip joint

127
00:03:45,330 --> 00:03:47,330
You happen to use your hip joint a lot

128
00:03:48,100 --> 00:03:49,060
Alright

129
00:03:49,560 --> 00:03:51,060
Now with the left leg then

130
00:03:50,830 --> 00:03:51,800
ow ow ow

131
00:03:51,660 --> 00:03:52,630
One, two

132
00:03:53,460 --> 00:03:55,260
Your hip joint is very important

133
00:03:54,460 --> 00:03:55,600
I see, I see

134
00:03:55,630 --> 00:03:57,060
Don't want to injure yourself after all

135
00:03:55,630 --> 00:03:57,160
Of course, right

136
00:03:57,160 --> 00:03:58,160
Your back too

137
00:03:58,160 --> 00:03:58,730
Back too

138
00:03:58,630 --> 00:03:59,400
Lastly

139
00:03:59,400 --> 00:04:01,400
Ow, ow, ow, this really hurts

140
00:04:01,860 --> 00:04:02,500
Alright

141
00:04:03,300 --> 00:04:04,500
Lastly then, here

142
00:04:04,500 --> 00:04:06,500
If you would stretch your sides then

143
00:04:06,800 --> 00:04:08,400
Hey, hey, hey, hey!

144
00:04:08,400 --> 00:04:10,400
Wa-wait a second!!

145
00:04:11,130 --> 00:04:11,560
Yes?

146
00:04:11,730 --> 00:04:15,160
He was totally looking at my underwear

147
00:04:17,660 --> 00:04:18,460
What, me?

148
00:04:20,300 --> 00:04:22,930
I wasn't trying to look at your underwear or anything

149
00:04:22,960 --> 00:04:24,160
Well, sorry, sorry

150
00:04:24,930 --> 00:04:28,560
Well, then, is there some guilty underwear glaring theme going on here?

151
00:04:27,700 --> 00:04:29,030
No, no there's nothing

152
00:04:30,330 --> 00:04:31,860
But you were totally looking!!

153
00:04:32,830 --> 00:04:36,130
Well, today I was hoping to teach you guys some golf

154
00:04:36,600 --> 00:04:39,360
I'm surprised at how fast I lost faith in guys

155
00:04:36,700 --> 00:04:37,100
Yes

156
00:04:39,360 --> 00:04:42,060
Ah, Ahhh, it's become more complicated now

157
00:04:42,060 --> 00:04:44,560
It seems to be one degree more complicated huh?

158
00:04:44,360 --> 00:04:45,560
It's not at all like that

159
00:04:45,160 --> 00:04:46,200
It won't be, will it?

160
00:04:45,660 --> 00:04:46,460
It won't be

161
00:04:46,660 --> 00:04:47,300
It won't be

162
00:04:47,100 --> 00:04:48,660
It would be best, wouldn't it?

163
00:04:48,460 --> 00:04:49,360
It's not like that right?

164
00:04:49,330 --> 00:04:50,430
It won't be, it won't be!

165
00:04:50,430 --> 00:04:51,630
What are you saying?

166
00:04:51,630 --> 00:04:52,300
You'll stop then?

167
00:04:52,130 --> 00:04:53,800
Right, let's do this like normal then

168
00:04:53,160 --> 00:04:53,930
Well Ok

169
00:04:53,900 --> 00:04:54,560
Alright

170
00:04:54,560 --> 00:04:55,800
Let's finish stretching then

171
00:04:56,460 --> 00:04:59,930
The first thing they'll learn is how to hold the golf club correctly

172
00:05:00,700 --> 00:05:02,500
Before we can start with the correct swing

173
00:05:02,500 --> 00:05:04,160
You must grip it right

174
00:05:04,200 --> 00:05:06,860
With the grip then, well, you have to use five fingers

175
00:05:06,900 --> 00:05:08,500
But you use the last three

176
00:05:08,500 --> 00:05:10,500
And you grip it underneath like this first

177
00:05:10,500 --> 00:05:11,000
Yea

178
00:05:11,000 --> 00:05:12,300
Where, which groove do I grip?

179
00:05:12,630 --> 00:05:14,630
Ahh, well, normally, uhh,

180
00:05:14,630 --> 00:05:16,360
T.N. I don't understand what Endo's saying here

181
00:05:17,030 --> 00:05:18,230
Everyone here's a man

182
00:05:18,230 --> 00:05:20,760
So you get your power from interlocking

183
00:05:20,760 --> 00:05:22,600
With the left hand, then

184
00:05:22,600 --> 00:05:24,600
With your bodies foundation

185
00:05:23,030 --> 00:05:24,230
He hasn't been listening

186
00:05:23,600 --> 00:05:25,060
I'm listening, I'm listening

187
00:05:25,060 --> 00:05:27,060
He's being arrogant because he's golfed before

188
00:05:25,900 --> 00:05:27,760
No, I've been listening

189
00:05:28,360 --> 00:05:30,760
Speaking of listening

190
00:05:29,330 --> 00:05:30,760
you were looking weren't you!!!

191
00:05:32,160 --> 00:05:33,330
I haven't looked

192
00:05:33,330 --> 00:05:36,430
Why did you come to this shoot anyway?

193
00:05:37,600 --> 00:05:40,430
Did you come here to look at your partner's underwear?

194
00:05:42,730 --> 00:05:43,230
No

195
00:05:43,930 --> 00:05:46,060
No, I haven't seen your underwear...

196
00:05:47,630 --> 00:05:49,100
I don't know If I can do this shoot

197
00:05:49,100 --> 00:05:50,660
Well, no, really

198
00:05:50,660 --> 00:05:51,400
Sorry, Sorry

199
00:05:51,400 --> 00:05:52,930
Because you've been looking

200
00:05:54,360 --> 00:05:56,130
Who else has looked?

201
00:05:57,660 --> 00:06:00,430
I don't get Tanaka

202
00:06:00,430 --> 00:06:02,430
He's has such a sincere expression

203
00:06:03,330 --> 00:06:05,100
I can't concentrate at all!!

204
00:06:06,560 --> 00:06:08,330
Really, should we just cut this?

205
00:06:09,030 --> 00:06:12,430
My partner for 30 years is looking at my underwear

206
00:06:12,430 --> 00:06:14,430
We can't possibly use this footage

207
00:06:16,830 --> 00:06:20,160
He's the worst one to be looking

208
00:06:19,500 --> 00:06:20,300
Well

209
00:06:20,300 --> 00:06:21,000
Yes

210
00:06:20,800 --> 00:06:21,660
Hamada, please

211
00:06:21,660 --> 00:06:24,260
Well, yea, not at all, I wouldn't do that

212
00:06:24,260 --> 00:06:26,660
Ehhh, really, can I do this?

213
00:06:27,660 --> 00:06:31,060
Let's then... learn how to hit the ball then

214
00:06:31,600 --> 00:06:33,700
Now that they've learned how to grip the club

215
00:06:33,700 --> 00:06:35,600
It's time to try the drive shot

216
00:06:35,600 --> 00:06:36,460
Do your best

217
00:06:36,130 --> 00:06:36,700
Yes

218
00:06:36,600 --> 00:06:38,400
I've never seen this done before

219
00:06:36,960 --> 00:06:38,460
First Hosei will

220
00:06:37,560 --> 00:06:39,360
Huhhh, really?

221
00:06:38,460 --> 00:06:40,430
Try to swing without instruction

222
00:06:44,800 --> 00:06:46,260
It was a while ago since you've tried, huh

223
00:06:45,800 --> 00:06:48,460
I had a little more hope for you than that

224
00:06:48,500 --> 00:06:49,460
Me too

225
00:06:49,560 --> 00:06:51,460
Next, Matsumoto, if you would

226
00:06:51,030 --> 00:06:51,560
Yes

227
00:06:51,260 --> 00:06:52,060
Please do

228
00:06:51,760 --> 00:06:53,330
I wonder how he'll do

229
00:06:53,460 --> 00:06:54,800
It's over there

230
00:06:54,330 --> 00:06:57,660
I wonder how Matsumoto's swing has changed these years

231
00:06:57,000 --> 00:06:58,300
Me too

232
00:06:57,200 --> 00:06:57,830
Me too

233
00:06:58,700 --> 00:06:59,560
Like this?

234
00:07:00,460 --> 00:07:02,600
That was nice, I felt it, nice swing

235
00:07:03,630 --> 00:07:04,600
Yea, nice swing

236
00:07:05,960 --> 00:07:07,630
Ahh, that's very good, yes

237
00:07:09,500 --> 00:07:10,230
Miss

238
00:07:11,030 --> 00:07:12,230
Right there

239
00:07:13,030 --> 00:07:15,630
Right there, you weren't looking at the ball

240
00:07:15,630 --> 00:07:17,400
This is its normal height

241
00:07:17,400 --> 00:07:20,130
But I'll raise it a little bit

242
00:07:18,760 --> 00:07:20,200
Ahh, ok

243
00:07:19,360 --> 00:07:20,260
Haa

244
00:07:20,130 --> 00:07:23,700
It should be easier to hit

245
00:07:21,230 --> 00:07:22,300
That's right

246
00:07:21,230 --> 00:07:22,330
I see, I see

247
00:07:23,730 --> 00:07:24,230
Ok

248
00:07:24,830 --> 00:07:26,200
It should be a little...

249
00:07:26,200 --> 00:07:26,530
Yes

250
00:07:26,530 --> 00:07:28,130
Look at the center of the ball

251
00:07:30,430 --> 00:07:32,500
So, since I changed the ball height

252
00:07:32,500 --> 00:07:34,200
Is it bad to not look at the ball?

253
00:07:34,030 --> 00:07:36,800
Well, the ball, look at the ball a bit more

254
00:07:35,560 --> 00:07:37,900
That's... yeah, you should look

255
00:07:36,400 --> 00:07:37,830
It'd be hard not looking at the ball

256
00:07:37,860 --> 00:07:40,230
It's bad to not look at the ball, but I wasn't looking

257
00:07:40,260 --> 00:07:45,530
Like how it's bad for you guys to look at my underwear but still do

258
00:07:48,430 --> 00:07:51,100
Celebrities that don't look at the ball, and

259
00:07:51,500 --> 00:07:53,760
Celebrities that look at underwear!!

260
00:07:54,800 --> 00:07:56,500
What's with this shoot?

261
00:08:03,630 --> 00:08:05,300
That's the second time

262
00:08:06,730 --> 00:08:11,600
The four, having broken their promises, made Matsumoto very angry

263
00:08:12,430 --> 00:08:15,060
They go to the next lesson location

264
00:08:15,400 --> 00:08:17,660
That's right, the next lesson point is...

265
00:08:17,930 --> 00:08:21,860
When one of the balls is left behind, Hamada goes and gets it...

266
00:08:22,230 --> 00:08:23,430
*Hey, hey, hey*

267
00:08:24,060 --> 00:08:24,760
Yes?

268
00:08:25,200 --> 00:08:27,160
Yeah, well, he's still looking

269
00:08:27,300 --> 00:08:28,130
Still?

270
00:08:28,130 --> 00:08:28,460
Yea

271
00:08:32,360 --> 00:08:34,030
Do you have a moment?

272
00:08:34,160 --> 00:08:34,760
Huh?

273
00:08:36,260 --> 00:08:37,600
Well....

274
00:08:38,460 --> 00:08:39,530
If you were looking

275
00:08:39,530 --> 00:08:41,530
Could you go apologize?

276
00:08:41,830 --> 00:08:42,360
Uhm

277
00:08:42,360 --> 00:08:43,830
I haven't looked

278
00:08:44,130 --> 00:08:45,830
What exactly am I looking at?

279
00:08:45,860 --> 00:08:49,000
Well, uhh, Matsumoto told us....

280
00:08:49,400 --> 00:08:52,230
Well, he's the only one wearing a mini skirt...

281
00:08:52,230 --> 00:08:53,860
It's a bit strange

282
00:08:53,860 --> 00:08:55,860
That's the only reason to look

283
00:08:55,860 --> 00:08:56,460
That's true

284
00:08:56,460 --> 00:08:58,460
Can't you see his whole @#*$?

285
00:08:58,360 --> 00:08:58,900
Huh

286
00:08:58,900 --> 00:08:59,900
It got bigger

287
00:08:59,100 --> 00:09:01,130
It's got way bigger

288
00:09:01,460 --> 00:09:04,030
When was the last time it was that big, huh...

289
00:09:04,660 --> 00:09:05,200
Ah

290
00:09:05,730 --> 00:09:06,560
What's wrong?

291
00:09:06,400 --> 00:09:08,100
Uh, nothing, nothing, uh

292
00:09:08,100 --> 00:09:09,530
We told him

293
00:09:08,960 --> 00:09:10,660
Talking about if I did see it

294
00:09:10,660 --> 00:09:12,660
It's not a problem anymore, really...

295
00:09:13,160 --> 00:09:15,500
Next is the bunker golf lesson

296
00:09:15,500 --> 00:09:16,260
Yes

297
00:09:16,500 --> 00:09:18,260
You totally just looked at my underwear, right?

298
00:09:18,260 --> 00:09:20,260
I'm telling you I didn't

299
00:09:20,760 --> 00:09:21,730
You saw them

300
00:09:21,060 --> 00:09:22,960
That is not so, if I did...

301
00:09:22,660 --> 00:09:23,760
You saw them

302
00:09:23,760 --> 00:09:25,360
Yes, now you just looked

303
00:09:25,360 --> 00:09:26,300
I did not

304
00:09:26,000 --> 00:09:26,900
You did

305
00:09:26,700 --> 00:09:27,900
I did not

306
00:09:27,560 --> 00:09:29,430
How many times after will you look?

307
00:09:28,930 --> 00:09:30,160
I did not look!

308
00:09:30,300 --> 00:09:33,460
If you'd stop looking and just admitted you looked

309
00:09:31,360 --> 00:09:33,800
Let's stop this, let's stop this

310
00:09:34,030 --> 00:09:35,290
I haven't looked

311
00:09:34,060 --> 00:09:36,760
Let's stop this, Let's stop this

312
00:09:35,290 --> 00:09:37,530
If you really saw my pants just say you did

313
00:09:37,160 --> 00:09:42,360
Let's stop this, Let's stop this

314
00:09:37,530 --> 00:09:42,230
So then I'll know that you can see them, and that this shoot is no good?

315
00:09:40,230 --> 00:09:41,360
I did not look

316
00:09:42,200 --> 00:09:44,130
I have not looked

317
00:09:42,360 --> 00:09:44,830
Let's stop with this fighting

318
00:09:45,260 --> 00:09:46,400
Next is....

319
00:09:45,430 --> 00:09:47,500
The next shoot is here then?

320
00:09:47,500 --> 00:09:51,030
The shoot where I cry myself to sleep?

321
00:09:52,300 --> 00:09:55,030
He definitely looked at my underwear though!

322
00:09:54,630 --> 00:09:58,030
I did not look at your underwear, let's play golf

323
00:09:55,130 --> 00:09:57,330
Let's stop this, let's stop this

324
00:09:57,460 --> 00:09:58,930
Let's play golf, let's play golf

325
00:09:58,930 --> 00:10:01,060
Does anyone want to look at my underwear then?

326
00:10:01,130 --> 00:10:02,700
There's no one, right?

327
00:10:02,700 --> 00:10:03,000
Yes

328
00:10:03,000 --> 00:10:03,200
Yes

329
00:10:03,200 --> 00:10:03,400
Yes

330
00:10:03,400 --> 00:10:05,400
Then please don't look!

331
00:10:05,730 --> 00:10:06,260
Yes

332
00:10:06,300 --> 00:10:06,530
Yes

333
00:10:06,530 --> 00:10:06,900
Yes

334
00:10:06,900 --> 00:10:09,360
Even you are peeping in the end

335
00:10:10,430 --> 00:10:11,430
I know!

336
00:10:12,830 --> 00:10:15,130
You give the most lewd face, you know

337
00:10:17,260 --> 00:10:18,400
It's ok to look

338
00:10:18,930 --> 00:10:19,600
However

339
00:10:20,360 --> 00:10:22,530
If you see it normally then I won't say anything

340
00:10:23,030 --> 00:10:28,800
It's the obscene part of when you look I hate, the lewd part

341
00:10:28,800 --> 00:10:31,160
Right now you were totally checking it out, right?

342
00:10:32,600 --> 00:10:33,660
You said normally

343
00:10:34,230 --> 00:10:36,400
Since you said we could look normally

344
00:10:36,760 --> 00:10:38,400
But you never look normally

345
00:10:38,400 --> 00:10:39,660
You're the worst here

346
00:10:39,660 --> 00:10:41,230
Endo, tell him

347
00:10:41,230 --> 00:10:42,630
Well, then, uh..., Hamada

348
00:10:42,630 --> 00:10:44,630
Take my example for how you should look, then

349
00:10:46,130 --> 00:10:47,200
Next up is

350
00:10:47,200 --> 00:10:49,200
The bunker shot lesson

351
00:10:50,460 --> 00:10:56,530
T.N. Don't understand

352
00:10:56,560 --> 00:11:00,130
After hitting from the bunker

353
00:11:00,130 --> 00:11:01,660
In good sportsmanship

354
00:11:01,660 --> 00:11:03,660
Rake the sand to be even again

355
00:11:05,100 --> 00:11:05,930
Then Matsumoto

356
00:11:06,000 --> 00:11:07,300
The least experienced

357
00:11:07,300 --> 00:11:10,200
First up is Matsumoto to face the bunker shot challenge

358
00:11:11,030 --> 00:11:12,200
It's so exposed

359
00:11:15,160 --> 00:11:17,360
First off, without looking below

360
00:11:18,200 --> 00:11:19,930
and make sure to look at the ball

361
00:11:20,900 --> 00:11:22,230
Oh, it's really buried

362
00:11:22,730 --> 00:11:23,460
Buried?

363
00:11:26,500 --> 00:11:27,330
That was good

364
00:11:27,330 --> 00:11:27,730
Nice

365
00:11:27,730 --> 00:11:29,800
A quick tip, you could do easier just like this

366
00:11:30,030 --> 00:11:32,400
Ahh, with this being a gentleman's sport

367
00:11:31,630 --> 00:11:32,130
Yes

368
00:11:32,130 --> 00:11:33,860
Make sure to, yea

369
00:11:33,730 --> 00:11:34,800
It's a gentleman's sport so

370
00:11:34,800 --> 00:11:36,700
You guys are not at all gentleman!!

371
00:11:36,800 --> 00:11:38,830
You were totally just looking at my underwear!!

372
00:11:40,830 --> 00:11:44,300
You want to see my underwear as much as you can

373
00:11:43,000 --> 00:11:44,300
on this slope

374
00:11:45,860 --> 00:11:49,060
After all, that's the only reason we came to this bunker, isn't it?

375
00:11:51,330 --> 00:11:53,830
While you guys were behind me

376
00:11:54,160 --> 00:11:56,200
You were totally looking weren't you?

377
00:11:56,400 --> 00:11:57,330
I wasn't looking...

378
00:11:57,230 --> 00:11:58,800
No, I wasn't looking...

379
00:11:58,200 --> 00:11:59,400
I wasn't really looking...

380
00:11:59,400 --> 00:12:01,400
Tanaka's the only one who hasn't said anything

381
00:12:02,730 --> 00:12:04,100
Tanaka please say something

382
00:12:04,700 --> 00:12:07,460
Tanaka, if you did or didn't see say

383
00:12:08,000 --> 00:12:10,360
Well... to say looked at...

384
00:12:10,360 --> 00:12:12,360
Say I saw or didn't see

385
00:12:14,360 --> 00:12:16,130
Well..., to say that...

386
00:12:15,760 --> 00:12:17,460
Say I saw or didn't see

387
00:12:16,730 --> 00:12:18,260
I saw, I saw

388
00:12:18,060 --> 00:12:19,700
You Saw!!!!

389
00:12:20,660 --> 00:12:22,400
You Saw my underwear

390
00:12:24,400 --> 00:12:25,900
What class rank were you in comedy school?

391
00:12:26,660 --> 00:12:27,900
I was ranked first!

392
00:12:28,930 --> 00:12:32,730
I was the first rank among all the comedians, what about you?

393
00:12:34,200 --> 00:12:35,900
I didn't go to comedy school...

394
00:12:36,860 --> 00:12:38,230
You didn't go to comedy school?

395
00:12:40,830 --> 00:12:43,200
How puzzling

396
00:12:44,230 --> 00:12:45,460
Go to comedy school!!!

397
00:12:49,930 --> 00:12:52,060
The bunker lesson ended after that

398
00:12:52,560 --> 00:12:56,100
In between lessons, they go to a break room

399
00:12:57,160 --> 00:12:58,100
We good?

400
00:12:58,100 --> 00:12:59,060
Yep

401
00:12:59,060 --> 00:12:59,360
Ok

402
00:13:02,460 --> 00:13:03,430
Wowww

403
00:13:04,830 --> 00:13:06,230
Yamachan, you should say it right?

404
00:13:06,430 --> 00:13:06,830
Huh?

405
00:13:07,060 --> 00:13:07,500
Say it

406
00:13:09,530 --> 00:13:10,230
Matsumoto

407
00:13:10,400 --> 00:13:10,900
Hm?

408
00:13:11,000 --> 00:13:12,900
We can see

409
00:13:18,800 --> 00:13:20,760
Let's rest here then

410
00:13:20,760 --> 00:13:21,330
Here?

411
00:13:21,200 --> 00:13:22,700
Break room, huh?

412
00:13:23,360 --> 00:13:24,400
Let's see it then

413
00:13:24,730 --> 00:13:27,100
There are snacks and drinks in the break room

414
00:13:25,530 --> 00:13:26,930
Let's take a small break then

415
00:13:27,560 --> 00:13:29,160
There are things like bread here

416
00:13:29,160 --> 00:13:31,660
Wow, I'm pretty tired huhh

417
00:13:33,460 --> 00:13:36,560
I think if you practice golf you'll get tired

418
00:13:36,560 --> 00:13:37,730
What do you mean by that?

419
00:13:37,730 --> 00:13:40,360
I think that if you practice golf

420
00:13:40,360 --> 00:13:46,660
T.N. Don't understand

421
00:13:47,030 --> 00:13:48,300
Ahhhh

422
00:13:52,730 --> 00:13:54,100
&^*%@

423
00:13:54,100 --> 00:13:55,530
I'm tired

424
00:13:57,000 --> 00:13:58,560
You were all looking!!!!

425
00:14:00,200 --> 00:14:02,300
I was being just a little bit careless

426
00:14:02,730 --> 00:14:04,300
I was always looking out here

427
00:14:04,300 --> 00:14:06,730
You say that but

428
00:14:06,730 --> 00:14:09,230
You're the senior, why didn't you say something?

429
00:14:09,260 --> 00:14:11,200
Matsumoto doesn't like it if you look

430
00:14:11,200 --> 00:14:13,230
So could you cut it out?

431
00:14:13,230 --> 00:14:16,060
You didn't even try to stop them

432
00:14:16,560 --> 00:14:18,060
Why didn't you say something?

433
00:14:19,600 --> 00:14:21,030
You didn't communicate

434
00:14:21,900 --> 00:14:24,230
But I think you did communicate

435
00:14:24,230 --> 00:14:26,800
Since you were always saying how they were looking

436
00:14:26,960 --> 00:14:29,200
I'm not sure I'm happy working with you all yet

437
00:14:29,900 --> 00:14:34,860
If I was with a better group this would be no problem

438
00:14:37,460 --> 00:14:41,460
Like with Matsunosuke Shoufukutei, then it would be no problem

439
00:14:37,460 --> 00:14:41,460
T.N. rakugo comedian

440
00:14:42,030 --> 00:14:44,660
I'm done with you people

441
00:14:44,730 --> 00:14:47,500
It's impossible for me to not be angry

442
00:14:47,760 --> 00:14:49,500
It would be way better if

443
00:14:49,500 --> 00:14:56,060
You made an environment were you'd tell me when you can see my underwear

444
00:14:56,860 --> 00:14:59,300
If you did that, then I wouldn't get angry

445
00:14:59,700 --> 00:15:03,560
If the creative agency asked me about seeing my underwear on T.V.

446
00:15:03,560 --> 00:15:07,260
If that happened, then it would be really bad for me

447
00:15:07,260 --> 00:15:08,600
So please tell me

448
00:15:08,400 --> 00:15:08,900
Ok

449
00:15:09,230 --> 00:15:09,760
Ok

450
00:15:09,760 --> 00:15:12,560
On the other end Matsumoto, you need to keep in mind...

451
00:15:12,630 --> 00:15:14,230
You just looked while talking

452
00:15:13,730 --> 00:15:14,230
No, no

453
00:15:14,900 --> 00:15:15,800
We see on accident

454
00:15:15,800 --> 00:15:17,000
Like when Endo

455
00:15:16,760 --> 00:15:19,000
If you just glance, if you just glance it's fine

456
00:15:19,560 --> 00:15:21,300
It's fine if you glance

457
00:15:21,630 --> 00:15:23,260
No, but we haven't been looking at all

458
00:15:23,130 --> 00:15:25,600
Just glance at a good time

459
00:15:23,260 --> 00:15:24,360
That's right, not at all

460
00:15:24,160 --> 00:15:25,060
That's right

461
00:15:25,600 --> 00:15:27,130
We haven't been looking

462
00:15:27,130 --> 00:15:29,300
You're all totally looking

463
00:15:29,300 --> 00:15:32,030
If I just wore different underwear

464
00:15:32,330 --> 00:15:35,030
You're all totally looking

465
00:15:35,030 --> 00:15:36,230
We haven't been looking

466
00:15:35,700 --> 00:15:37,600
We haven't been looking, we haven't been looking

467
00:15:36,030 --> 00:15:38,400
You're always looking

468
00:15:38,100 --> 00:15:38,760
We haven't been looking

469
00:15:38,760 --> 00:15:39,500
We haven't been looking

470
00:15:39,500 --> 00:15:41,830
You're even looking now!!

471
00:15:50,360 --> 00:15:51,100
We're not looking

472
00:15:50,800 --> 00:15:51,500
He's crying

473
00:15:51,500 --> 00:15:53,330
Not looking, nobody's looking

474
00:15:53,330 --> 00:15:54,960
We're not looking

475
00:15:54,960 --> 00:15:56,960
Could you just change clothes?

476
00:15:56,960 --> 00:15:57,660
Matsumoto!!

477
00:15:58,160 --> 00:15:59,360
Really, Matsumoto

478
00:15:58,500 --> 00:16:00,160
Can't he change his clothes?

479
00:16:00,160 --> 00:16:02,960
Not looking, no one else is looking

480
00:16:03,100 --> 00:16:08,200
16 Minutes since entering the break room

481
00:16:03,330 --> 00:16:05,460
Huhh, what should I do...

482
00:16:06,000 --> 00:16:07,930
I can't relax at all

483
00:16:09,060 --> 00:16:13,460
Actually, actaully, I have something to say to you guys

484
00:16:13,460 --> 00:16:15,460
I heard something when I was pretending not to listen

485
00:16:16,700 --> 00:16:18,460
Hamada, you said that

486
00:16:18,460 --> 00:16:20,260
It looks like he has an erection

487
00:16:23,000 --> 00:16:24,830
Where in the world

488
00:16:25,630 --> 00:16:28,000
While shooting a golf program

489
00:16:28,000 --> 00:16:31,900
Will someone after looking at someone's underwear and then say he has an erection

490
00:16:32,530 --> 00:16:34,030
Uh, well, Yamachan...

491
00:16:33,460 --> 00:16:34,060
No, no

492
00:16:34,060 --> 00:16:35,500
Said that it got bigger

493
00:16:35,600 --> 00:16:36,960
I didn't do anything like...

494
00:16:36,160 --> 00:16:36,900
Hey

495
00:16:38,660 --> 00:16:39,160
Hey

496
00:16:39,860 --> 00:16:42,160
You can totally see my underwear

497
00:16:42,430 --> 00:16:43,500
What are you doing?

498
00:16:43,560 --> 00:16:44,860
I say that but

499
00:16:45,000 --> 00:16:47,960
And the staff says as well that this won't end today

500
00:16:48,630 --> 00:16:49,200
Huh?

501
00:16:51,160 --> 00:16:53,260
I'll be doing this forever

502
00:16:53,300 --> 00:16:55,100
I don't want to change this

503
00:16:57,160 --> 00:17:01,230
You guy's will look back and think it's not your fault,
but you'll regret you didn't change your staring

504
00:17:01,230 --> 00:17:03,230
Would you change your mind if we weren't looking?

505
00:17:03,700 --> 00:17:05,630
It's fine to look!!

506
00:17:07,330 --> 00:17:09,500
How many time's have I said it's ok?!?!

507
00:17:09,330 --> 00:17:10,700
That's not true

508
00:17:10,330 --> 00:17:12,530
I said it was bad to look once

509
00:17:12,600 --> 00:17:14,330
Look in the recordings!!

510
00:17:15,630 --> 00:17:16,760
Should we look once?

511
00:17:16,460 --> 00:17:17,660
Sure, let's look

512
00:17:16,860 --> 00:17:17,660
Let's look? Let's look

513
00:17:17,430 --> 00:17:18,430
Let's look at it then

514
00:17:19,860 --> 00:17:21,260
Wa-wai-wait!!

515
00:17:23,360 --> 00:17:24,700
What are you doing!?!?

516
00:17:25,360 --> 00:17:25,830
What are we doing?

517
00:17:26,100 --> 00:17:27,230
What's with you

518
00:17:26,700 --> 00:17:27,430
What's wrong?

519
00:17:27,360 --> 00:17:28,160
What's wrong?

520
00:17:28,800 --> 00:17:31,100
I want you to see accidentally

521
00:17:32,100 --> 00:17:33,200
Accidentally

522
00:17:33,900 --> 00:17:39,160
I hate it if you glance at my pants and then turn away

523
00:17:39,700 --> 00:17:43,060
If you glance around and happen to see them than that's fine

524
00:17:43,060 --> 00:17:46,430
That's what I mean when I say it's fine to look!!

525
00:17:47,300 --> 00:17:48,930
Well then, go ahead and look

526
00:17:49,560 --> 00:17:50,800
Well then, go ahead and look

527
00:17:50,800 --> 00:17:54,560
Well to bad, that you can't see them!!

528
00:18:00,800 --> 00:18:01,560
What's wrong?

529
00:18:04,400 --> 00:18:05,400
What's wrong here?

530
00:18:05,700 --> 00:18:06,960
You are!!

531
00:18:06,460 --> 00:18:07,930
Who's making this mood

532
00:18:10,560 --> 00:18:13,860
27 minutes since entering the break room

533
00:18:10,730 --> 00:18:13,860
It's been 27 minutes since we've entered this room

534
00:18:15,000 --> 00:18:16,500
Why can't we go out?

535
00:18:15,860 --> 00:18:18,200
I don't feel like going out!!!

536
00:18:18,200 --> 00:18:19,460
Let's get out of here

537
00:18:18,300 --> 00:18:19,700
Why don't you feel like it?

538
00:18:19,700 --> 00:18:22,360
Let's go... Let's go to the green

539
00:18:22,660 --> 00:18:25,800
Green, huh... What color is my underwear?

540
00:18:26,430 --> 00:18:27,800
Yes, Yamasaki-san

541
00:18:29,760 --> 00:18:31,760
White

542
00:18:30,260 --> 00:18:31,930
Yep, you saw

543
00:18:33,300 --> 00:18:34,900
Let's go, we can practice...

544
00:18:34,900 --> 00:18:39,100
Wait a second, I haven't been able to drink a single drop of water

545
00:18:39,260 --> 00:18:42,200
Since you guys have been staring at my underwear

546
00:18:42,200 --> 00:18:45,400
I haven't had time to drink any water

547
00:18:45,830 --> 00:18:47,060
Would you like coffee, or...

548
00:18:46,530 --> 00:18:50,060
When I come home, my wife will ask me what's wrong

549
00:18:50,060 --> 00:18:52,060
Why are you so thirsty

550
00:18:52,060 --> 00:18:54,060
Well, everyone was staring at my underwear

551
00:18:55,230 --> 00:18:56,500
I wasn't able to get a drink

552
00:18:56,500 --> 00:18:58,730
Huhh, what are you doing?

553
00:19:00,700 --> 00:19:03,430
When I'm thirsty I don't drink black coffee

554
00:19:04,460 --> 00:19:05,330
That's bad

555
00:19:05,330 --> 00:19:06,400
Black, huh

556
00:19:06,400 --> 00:19:09,600
Black, and there's the green, and what color is my underwear

557
00:19:10,160 --> 00:19:10,630
White

558
00:19:10,630 --> 00:19:11,500
Yep, you looked

559
00:19:11,500 --> 00:19:13,500
You've been looking this whole time, huh

560
00:19:13,500 --> 00:19:15,500
You've been able to many times, huh

561
00:19:15,500 --> 00:19:18,730
I think I won't wear white underwear from now on

562
00:19:18,560 --> 00:19:19,200
Here's water

563
00:19:20,200 --> 00:19:21,330
Hmmm

564
00:19:22,000 --> 00:19:24,000
This isn't any color, really...

565
00:19:26,900 --> 00:19:29,700
36 minutes since entering the break room

566
00:19:26,900 --> 00:19:29,700
I'm so glad I put on underwear today

567
00:19:29,700 --> 00:19:33,600
If I didn't wear underwear I wouldn't understand why you'd guys would look

568
00:19:34,460 --> 00:19:36,830
My underwear is protecting me

569
00:19:37,030 --> 00:19:38,160
Let's go Endo

570
00:19:37,730 --> 00:19:40,960
If I wasn't wearing underwear, what would you be looking at exactly

571
00:19:41,130 --> 00:19:41,830
Yes

572
00:19:41,830 --> 00:19:42,830
Please wait a second

573
00:19:44,130 --> 00:19:44,930
I'm not done

574
00:19:44,600 --> 00:19:45,400
But

575
00:19:46,800 --> 00:19:48,560
But we're going to the green

576
00:19:47,660 --> 00:19:48,500
There's more?

577
00:19:49,060 --> 00:19:49,960
There's more?

578
00:19:50,000 --> 00:19:51,230
Really?

579
00:19:51,230 --> 00:19:53,300
We're going to the green

580
00:19:52,900 --> 00:19:54,360
We'll go in five minutes

581
00:19:53,030 --> 00:19:54,400
What with this pattern

582
00:19:54,560 --> 00:19:56,730
T.N. Don't understand

583
00:19:54,560 --> 00:19:58,160
43 Minutes since entering the break room

584
00:19:58,230 --> 00:20:01,260
If you want to look at my underwear, please look during recording

585
00:20:01,260 --> 00:20:02,730
So everyone can know

586
00:20:03,360 --> 00:20:05,500
That you love my underwear

587
00:20:06,930 --> 00:20:08,300
You just agreed, didn't you?

588
00:20:08,800 --> 00:20:09,700
No, I wasn't

589
00:20:09,700 --> 00:20:11,400
I was just saying yes

590
00:20:11,400 --> 00:20:13,300
I'm listening to what you're saying

591
00:20:12,230 --> 00:20:14,500
Then, then you'll stop

592
00:20:13,730 --> 00:20:14,760
Yes, yes, yes

593
00:20:14,130 --> 00:20:15,430
Various: We won't look

594
00:20:15,430 --> 00:20:17,130
Then, you won't after this

595
00:20:16,860 --> 00:20:19,800
Various: We won't look

596
00:20:19,830 --> 00:20:20,600
Hey

597
00:20:21,260 --> 00:20:23,560
T.N. Don't understand

598
00:20:23,560 --> 00:20:24,130
Hey

599
00:20:24,130 --> 00:20:24,530
Yes

600
00:20:24,800 --> 00:20:25,600
Endo let's go

601
00:20:25,600 --> 00:20:26,060
Yes

602
00:20:26,060 --> 00:20:26,960
Then, the green

603
00:20:26,660 --> 00:20:27,630
Let's go to the green

604
00:20:27,430 --> 00:20:28,600
We still have to practice

605
00:20:27,960 --> 00:20:29,430
You just looked, huh!

606
00:20:29,430 --> 00:20:31,400
You just looked!!

607
00:20:30,700 --> 00:20:31,860
No one looked

608
00:20:31,230 --> 00:20:32,530
I didn't look, I didn't look

609
00:20:32,700 --> 00:20:33,600
I really didn't

610
00:20:33,200 --> 00:20:34,100
No one is

611
00:20:33,730 --> 00:20:34,460
No one's looking

612
00:20:38,130 --> 00:20:39,460
The last lesson is

613
00:20:39,460 --> 00:20:41,100
How to putt

614
00:20:42,300 --> 00:20:45,060
Before they start the last lesson, while they are on standby

615
00:20:47,830 --> 00:20:50,100
Matsumoto's chest has changed

616
00:20:51,600 --> 00:20:54,460
Then, the last lesson is putting

617
00:20:54,160 --> 00:20:54,430
Yes

618
00:20:54,430 --> 00:20:55,000
Putter

619
00:20:55,560 --> 00:20:57,000
Wellll, then

620
00:20:57,000 --> 00:20:58,800
The driver shot

621
00:20:58,800 --> 00:21:00,800
Is imitated in putting

622
00:21:01,100 --> 00:21:03,930
So if you do that, you'll profit

623
00:21:04,600 --> 00:21:06,030
If you do that much, then...

624
00:21:06,330 --> 00:21:08,660
Have you ever heard that before?

625
00:21:10,260 --> 00:21:11,030
Huhh?

626
00:21:12,200 --> 00:21:13,800
Have you ever heard of that?

627
00:21:15,900 --> 00:21:16,660
Then Matsumoto-San

628
00:21:16,660 --> 00:21:19,060
First Matsumoto will try to putt on his own

629
00:21:19,060 --> 00:21:20,400
In this putting challenge

630
00:21:33,400 --> 00:21:34,430
You know

631
00:21:35,300 --> 00:21:38,400
What will the audience think of this?

632
00:21:39,630 --> 00:21:41,130
What's with you guys?

633
00:21:40,760 --> 00:21:41,200
Huh?

634
00:21:42,260 --> 00:21:43,560
What is this?

635
00:21:48,300 --> 00:21:49,800
Hey, wait a second

636
00:21:51,260 --> 00:21:52,400
Let's go back

637
00:21:54,800 --> 00:21:57,130
You guy's haven't gotten anything

638
00:21:57,560 --> 00:21:58,300
Let's go back

639
00:21:59,100 --> 00:22:00,300
Hey!!!

640
00:21:59,900 --> 00:22:01,000
What is it, jeez?

641
00:22:01,000 --> 00:22:02,260
Bring it here

642
00:22:03,530 --> 00:22:04,260
What's this?

643
00:22:06,030 --> 00:22:08,430
Actually, I expected this in advance

644
00:22:08,430 --> 00:22:13,800
The staff has been counting how many time's you've looked at my underwear

645
00:22:14,960 --> 00:22:16,860
How many time's you've looked

646
00:22:17,200 --> 00:22:18,860
This is how many times

647
00:22:20,530 --> 00:22:22,900
This is actually how many times

648
00:22:24,360 --> 00:22:32,730
Hamada

649
00:22:24,360 --> 00:22:32,730
Tanaka

650
00:22:24,400 --> 00:22:32,730
Endo

651
00:22:24,400 --> 00:22:32,730
Yamasaki

652
00:22:24,430 --> 00:22:26,660
In front of the camera

653
00:22:27,700 --> 00:22:28,700
Say that

654
00:22:29,130 --> 00:22:30,700
I saw Matsumoto's underwear

655
00:22:31,200 --> 00:22:32,700
10 times

656
00:22:34,230 --> 00:22:38,500
Then after that, let's do a one shot

657
00:22:38,800 --> 00:22:42,000
Should we do it with a grain filter?

658
00:22:41,530 --> 00:22:42,030
Yes

659
00:22:42,600 --> 00:22:44,000
Let's start from Yamasaki

660
00:22:44,400 --> 00:22:45,000
Now?

661
00:22:44,830 --> 00:22:45,030
Yes

662
00:22:45,000 --> 00:22:45,300
Ok

663
00:22:45,360 --> 00:22:46,300
Do it alone

664
00:22:51,400 --> 00:22:54,530
I saw Matsumoto's underwear 10 times

665
00:22:56,500 --> 00:22:57,430
This exists now?

666
00:22:58,560 --> 00:22:59,230
Right

667
00:23:01,400 --> 00:23:03,100
I saw it 7 times

668
00:23:03,460 --> 00:23:06,800
I, uhh, saw Matsumoto's underwear 6 times

669
00:23:06,800 --> 00:23:08,800
I saw 12 times

670
00:23:09,860 --> 00:23:10,800
Alright

671
00:23:11,260 --> 00:23:14,360
Then, lastly, let's all get together

672
00:23:16,730 --> 00:23:17,760
I'll be the center

673
00:23:22,330 --> 00:23:24,500
I saw Matsumoto's underwear

674
00:23:24,500 --> 00:23:26,330
And yell at the end

675
00:23:26,260 --> 00:23:27,030
Lastly?

676
00:23:26,700 --> 00:23:27,260
Yes

677
00:23:27,460 --> 00:23:28,030
Ok

678
00:23:28,700 --> 00:23:30,060
Well, then, I'll do this

679
00:23:30,700 --> 00:23:31,360
It's like this?

680
00:23:31,360 --> 00:23:32,400
It's like this then?

681
00:23:33,930 --> 00:23:35,000
Ready, set

682
00:23:35,460 --> 00:23:38,130
I saw Matsumoto's underwear

683
00:23:42,360 --> 00:23:43,360
Alright

684
00:23:43,800 --> 00:23:44,430
Right

685
00:23:45,160 --> 00:23:48,130
I don't want to do that again

686
00:23:48,430 --> 00:23:49,630
Let's go home

687
00:23:52,030 --> 00:23:53,060
Can we go home?
