1
00:00:00,760 --> 00:00:02,000
Let's go.

2
00:00:03,330 --> 00:00:06,960
Hamada and the others arrived
at the airport in Bangkok.

3
00:00:07,860 --> 00:00:11,530
Hamada, e-cigarettes are banned in Thailand.

4
00:00:12,830 --> 00:00:16,430
Anywhere in the country.
Now, you usually smoke it.

5
00:00:16,760 --> 00:00:20,900
So I brought this, just in case you need it.

6
00:00:21,130 --> 00:00:21,980
What is it?

7
00:00:22,060 --> 00:00:24,200
Please use this, if you have to.

8
00:00:24,400 --> 00:00:27,100
-No e-cigarettes?
-Not in Thailand.

9
00:00:27,900 --> 00:00:29,860
Those are the stuff, right?

10
00:00:30,100 --> 00:00:31,450
-A must for a boss.
-Wait, wait.

11
00:00:31,600 --> 00:00:32,800
It looks like poop.

12
00:00:35,900 --> 00:00:38,050
Nice. You look really cool.

13
00:00:38,650 --> 00:00:41,330
-Pattaya will be different.
-Apparently.

14
00:00:41,530 --> 00:00:43,330
Why are you wearing shorts?

15
00:00:44,500 --> 00:00:47,430
Don't kick me.
I was wearing them all along.

16
00:00:47,760 --> 00:00:49,230
I'm hot in my pants.

17
00:00:49,430 --> 00:00:50,760
Don't stretch yours.

18
00:00:52,530 --> 00:00:54,750
You got scared about it.

19
00:00:54,830 --> 00:00:57,250
-Shorts are bad.
-Yeah.

20
00:00:57,460 --> 00:00:58,700
Not on TV.

21
00:00:58,930 --> 00:01:00,800
Your shoes are terrible.

22
00:01:01,460 --> 00:01:02,900
Worse than my shorts.

23
00:01:03,100 --> 00:01:04,780
Are you going to school?

24
00:01:04,860 --> 00:01:07,600
They're loafers. I'm trying to be stylish.

25
00:01:08,430 --> 00:01:10,660
-So unnecessary.
-No, it's not.

26
00:01:12,060 --> 00:01:13,480
Don't look for faults.

27
00:01:13,560 --> 00:01:16,330
I'm glad my outfit is fine.

28
00:01:16,560 --> 00:01:18,800
-Okay, let's go to Pattaya.
-Let's go.

29
00:01:18,960 --> 00:01:20,800
Yeah, let's go.

30
00:01:22,060 --> 00:01:25,660
Pattaya is about a two-hour drive
away from Bangkok.

31
00:01:28,530 --> 00:01:34,100
Fellow comedians researched Pattaya
and gave presentations to Hamada.

32
00:01:35,400 --> 00:01:39,100
He ranked them and revealed up to third place.

33
00:01:40,500 --> 00:01:44,330
Who is going to win first place
for the best presentation?

34
00:01:46,360 --> 00:01:48,160
-Who is left?
-Me.

35
00:01:49,830 --> 00:01:52,260
-You're either first or second.
-Yes.

36
00:01:53,000 --> 00:01:54,950
Which are you announcing first?

37
00:01:55,030 --> 00:01:56,000
So nervous.

38
00:01:56,100 --> 00:01:58,500
-In the right order.
-Second place.

39
00:01:59,230 --> 00:02:01,000
-Okay.
-Second is fine.

40
00:02:01,800 --> 00:02:03,260
Second place is...

41
00:02:03,430 --> 00:02:05,500
The prize is 2,000 bahts.

42
00:02:05,600 --> 00:02:07,600
Wow, that's awesome.

43
00:02:17,130 --> 00:02:18,230
Hirai.

44
00:02:21,360 --> 00:02:22,630
Nice one.

45
00:02:22,930 --> 00:02:24,100
Wait a second.

46
00:02:24,300 --> 00:02:25,430
What? No way.

47
00:02:25,700 --> 00:02:27,000
I'm in second.

48
00:02:27,200 --> 00:02:29,020
It's good. Thank you.

49
00:02:29,100 --> 00:02:31,650
I had to give you second place.

50
00:02:31,730 --> 00:02:34,580
You even went to the barber,

51
00:02:34,660 --> 00:02:37,060
not knowing what will happen to you.

52
00:02:37,260 --> 00:02:38,380
That's right.

53
00:02:38,460 --> 00:02:41,050
-It was a gamble.
-Well done.

54
00:02:41,150 --> 00:02:42,300
I'm humbled.

55
00:02:42,380 --> 00:02:43,820
Not just the haircut.

56
00:02:43,900 --> 00:02:45,800
-You did well overall.
-Thank you.

57
00:02:46,160 --> 00:02:48,750
You ate a lot of creatures like scorpion.

58
00:02:48,830 --> 00:02:49,680
I did.

59
00:02:49,760 --> 00:02:51,750
You did well throughout.

60
00:02:51,900 --> 00:02:53,230
Really? Thank you.

61
00:02:54,430 --> 00:02:57,220
Hamada was full of praise for Hirai.

62
00:02:57,300 --> 00:02:59,700
What was his presentation like?

63
00:03:01,230 --> 00:03:02,860
Okay, next presentation.

64
00:03:04,300 --> 00:03:07,180
I think we've seen enough.

65
00:03:07,260 --> 00:03:09,350
The floating market was fun.

66
00:03:09,430 --> 00:03:10,880
Yeah, Hamada.

67
00:03:10,960 --> 00:03:15,330
Your sticker suggests that
you want to go to the market.

68
00:03:16,700 --> 00:03:17,950
You left it on you.

69
00:03:18,030 --> 00:03:19,430
You want to go back?

70
00:03:20,530 --> 00:03:22,060
You must've loved it.

71
00:03:22,260 --> 00:03:24,800
-It's a pass.
-Yeah, that's right.

72
00:03:24,900 --> 00:03:27,100
He can go back there today.

73
00:03:27,630 --> 00:03:31,030
No, why didn't you tell me I had it on?

74
00:03:31,300 --> 00:03:32,230
We didn't see.

75
00:03:32,700 --> 00:03:34,160
I only just realized.

76
00:03:34,460 --> 00:03:35,900
I just thought...

77
00:03:36,260 --> 00:03:39,000
I thought you were just enjoying yourself.

78
00:03:39,430 --> 00:03:40,430
I mean...

79
00:03:42,830 --> 00:03:43,750
Hey, come on.

80
00:03:43,830 --> 00:03:45,300
My neck...

81
00:03:45,830 --> 00:03:46,780
This is deja vu.

82
00:03:46,860 --> 00:03:49,300
You say that, but...

83
00:03:50,130 --> 00:03:51,560
You haven't realized?

84
00:03:52,000 --> 00:03:53,360
No, don't tell me...

85
00:03:56,930 --> 00:03:58,600
You had it on all along.

86
00:04:00,330 --> 00:04:02,000
He had it on all along.

87
00:04:02,130 --> 00:04:04,920
I thought someone put it on him.

88
00:04:05,000 --> 00:04:06,030
You put it on.

89
00:04:06,160 --> 00:04:08,960
Why would I? I didn't even notice mine.

90
00:04:09,560 --> 00:04:10,650
Was it you?

91
00:04:10,730 --> 00:04:12,580
You put it on your own back.

92
00:04:12,660 --> 00:04:16,000
I put it on myself? Come on, that makes no sense.

93
00:04:16,330 --> 00:04:17,860
So what's the deal?

94
00:04:18,100 --> 00:04:20,860
We still have plans to make. Go, Hirai.

95
00:04:20,940 --> 00:04:21,780
Here I am.

96
00:04:21,860 --> 00:04:23,560
Ah, it's your turn, is it?

97
00:04:23,700 --> 00:04:25,000
Hirai, go for it!

98
00:04:25,080 --> 00:04:26,800
Welcome to Thailand.

99
00:04:28,000 --> 00:04:29,950
-That's not it.
-Gangnam Style.

100
00:04:30,030 --> 00:04:32,100
Cut it out.

101
00:04:32,500 --> 00:04:33,830
Do Gangnam Style.

102
00:04:36,200 --> 00:04:38,660
-Gangnam style.
-Hirai party style.

103
00:04:40,000 --> 00:04:41,930
I'm taking these off.

104
00:04:42,130 --> 00:04:45,100
There's so much more to Thailand.

105
00:04:45,260 --> 00:04:50,000
I used magazines, the Internet,
and reviews for research.

106
00:04:50,200 --> 00:04:51,520
That wasn't enough.

107
00:04:51,600 --> 00:04:55,480
I wanted valuable information from CEOs...

108
00:04:55,560 --> 00:04:58,330
...who had been to Thailand.

109
00:04:58,830 --> 00:05:03,400
So I went to Shimbashi and looked for
CEOs like Yama-chan.

110
00:05:04,230 --> 00:05:06,030
Who? I don't know him.

111
00:05:06,130 --> 00:05:08,100
Yama-chan knows Thailand well.

112
00:05:08,700 --> 00:05:11,800
Let me tell you something he said. OK?

113
00:05:12,730 --> 00:05:15,920
"He who rules the Thai night rules the journey."

114
00:05:16,000 --> 00:05:17,130
What the hell?

115
00:05:18,000 --> 00:05:20,400
What does that even mean?

116
00:05:20,730 --> 00:05:23,180
So I'm going to focus on nighttime.

117
00:05:23,260 --> 00:05:26,330
I mean, you must be quite tired.

118
00:05:26,560 --> 00:05:28,700
You've been busy in Japan too.

119
00:05:29,100 --> 00:05:31,000
That's true.

120
00:05:31,230 --> 00:05:33,830
So first, let's go for a massage.

121
00:05:34,530 --> 00:05:37,100
Thailand is famous for great massages.

122
00:05:37,460 --> 00:05:40,250
There's foot or face massage and all sorts.

123
00:05:40,330 --> 00:05:42,360
But there's one that I recommend.

124
00:05:42,700 --> 00:05:45,860
They use wooden mallets called "tok sen."

125
00:05:46,230 --> 00:05:52,200
And this type of massage that
uses tok sen is really something.

126
00:05:52,560 --> 00:05:56,560
Massage using fingers can
only work on our muscles.

127
00:05:56,830 --> 00:06:00,560
But actually, it's the inner bones that are tired.

128
00:06:01,000 --> 00:06:04,880
Their technique works on
the inner parts effectively.

129
00:06:05,300 --> 00:06:06,860
According to Yama-chan.

130
00:06:07,150 --> 00:06:09,350
-Yama-chan.
-Who is he?

131
00:06:09,430 --> 00:06:11,230
The famous Yama-chan?

132
00:06:12,200 --> 00:06:13,050
Doesn't it hurt?

133
00:06:13,130 --> 00:06:14,460
Oh it hurts bad.

134
00:06:16,960 --> 00:06:19,700
-It's really painful.
-Who'd want to go then?

135
00:06:19,780 --> 00:06:23,600
I don't want to go there if it's painful.

136
00:06:23,900 --> 00:06:26,250
Everyone there was shouting in pain.

137
00:06:26,900 --> 00:06:30,200
But the next day, you really feel the benefit.

138
00:06:30,400 --> 00:06:31,720
Ah, the next day.

139
00:06:31,800 --> 00:06:32,850
A transformation.

140
00:06:32,930 --> 00:06:33,880
But it hurts?

141
00:06:33,960 --> 00:06:36,500
It really hurts on the day.

142
00:06:37,230 --> 00:06:38,080
That's right.

143
00:06:38,160 --> 00:06:39,380
That's scary.

144
00:06:39,460 --> 00:06:41,920
Here, listen up.

145
00:06:42,000 --> 00:06:43,730
Don't tell me to listen.

146
00:06:46,530 --> 00:06:47,930
This way, this way.

147
00:06:48,160 --> 00:06:50,030
Why are you facing that way?

148
00:06:51,000 --> 00:06:52,420
Tell me how it's done.

149
00:06:52,500 --> 00:06:54,460
Initially, they're gentle.

150
00:06:55,230 --> 00:06:55,980
Sounds fine.

151
00:06:56,060 --> 00:06:58,720
Right. And they tap rhythmically.

152
00:06:58,800 --> 00:07:02,050
But on the beat, they tap you hard which hurts.

153
00:07:02,530 --> 00:07:03,600
I see.

154
00:07:03,700 --> 00:07:05,150
So it doesn't always hurt.

155
00:07:05,230 --> 00:07:08,650
-And the next day you feel good.
-I see.

156
00:07:08,800 --> 00:07:10,980
You won't get this massage in Japan.

157
00:07:11,060 --> 00:07:12,850
Yeah, I get what you mean.

158
00:07:12,930 --> 00:07:15,420
Just guarantee me that it'll be fine.

159
00:07:15,500 --> 00:07:17,450
And there's one more place.

160
00:07:17,530 --> 00:07:19,250
It's the night market.

161
00:07:19,330 --> 00:07:21,930
Pattaya's famous for the night market.

162
00:07:22,060 --> 00:07:25,930
There are 300 stalls, including food stalls.

163
00:07:26,060 --> 00:07:30,200
They sell gifts too, but all sorts of
Thai food are sold there.

164
00:07:30,400 --> 00:07:33,280
A whole row of them, right and left.

165
00:07:33,360 --> 00:07:36,400
-You don't visit stalls in Japan, do you?
-Nope.

166
00:07:36,860 --> 00:07:41,200
So I really would like to go there
with all of you here.

167
00:07:41,330 --> 00:07:42,600
Stalls all the way?

168
00:07:43,030 --> 00:07:44,020
Like what?

169
00:07:44,100 --> 00:07:45,730
Chicken skewers.

170
00:07:46,900 --> 00:07:50,050
Yama-chan says chicken and beer are "Hmph."

171
00:07:51,530 --> 00:07:53,360
Yama-chan said that?

172
00:07:53,700 --> 00:07:56,460
Chicken skewers and beer are a great combo.

173
00:07:56,600 --> 00:07:58,260
Why "Hmph"?

174
00:07:59,460 --> 00:08:00,880
The famous Yama-chan.

175
00:08:00,960 --> 00:08:02,400
That's one option, but...

176
00:08:02,900 --> 00:08:04,350
There's a lot more.

177
00:08:04,430 --> 00:08:06,360
I want to go there together.

178
00:08:06,630 --> 00:08:07,960
Let me think.

179
00:08:08,160 --> 00:08:09,620
Hmm, well...

180
00:08:09,700 --> 00:08:11,560
-Can we do shopping?
-Yes.

181
00:08:13,230 --> 00:08:17,100
Hamada became more and more excited after this.

182
00:08:19,300 --> 00:08:23,030
This is Pattaya's famous night market.

183
00:08:24,900 --> 00:08:26,860
It's the weekend as well.

184
00:08:27,130 --> 00:08:29,150
-It's packed full.
-Wow.

185
00:08:30,130 --> 00:08:33,330
Workers, tourists... everyone comes here.

186
00:08:35,400 --> 00:08:37,560
Look. T-shirts for 60 bahts.

187
00:08:37,900 --> 00:08:39,330
60 bahts?

188
00:08:40,230 --> 00:08:41,930
About 180 yen.

189
00:08:42,400 --> 00:08:43,360
Wow, 200 yen?

190
00:08:43,860 --> 00:08:45,720
And this is the start.

191
00:08:45,800 --> 00:08:47,960
It smells really nice.

192
00:08:48,700 --> 00:08:52,380
If you fancy anything, you can also try it a bit.

193
00:08:52,460 --> 00:08:54,800
-Really?
-Yes, you can.

194
00:08:54,900 --> 00:08:57,880
Are there things that I should eat?

195
00:08:57,960 --> 00:09:00,160
He said chicken skewers.

196
00:09:00,630 --> 00:09:02,300
According to Yama-chan.

197
00:09:02,900 --> 00:09:05,560
That lady's got a chicken skewer.

198
00:09:06,260 --> 00:09:07,930
Let's eat some chicken.

199
00:09:08,260 --> 00:09:10,760
-Let's eat it.
-This is fun.

200
00:09:11,260 --> 00:09:15,700
There's a chicken skewer called "nok"
that you can only eat here.

201
00:09:15,860 --> 00:09:17,130
Nok?

202
00:09:17,530 --> 00:09:19,280
I can't read the signs.

203
00:09:19,360 --> 00:09:21,200
There it is.

204
00:09:24,230 --> 00:09:25,320
So this is nok?

205
00:09:25,400 --> 00:09:26,960
-Yeah.
-Three skewers?

206
00:09:27,530 --> 00:09:28,380
Thank you.

207
00:09:28,460 --> 00:09:30,260
That's the best choice.

208
00:09:32,160 --> 00:09:33,400
Look at this.

209
00:09:34,830 --> 00:09:36,360
-Scared?
-I'm fine.

210
00:09:36,460 --> 00:09:38,160
Let me taste it first.

211
00:09:40,830 --> 00:09:42,970
-This is delicious.
-Yeah?

212
00:09:43,160 --> 00:09:46,800
Please try it. It's delicious. A bit spicy too.

213
00:09:49,660 --> 00:09:50,480
It's good.

214
00:09:50,560 --> 00:09:51,630
Right?

215
00:09:54,000 --> 00:09:55,220
It's quite unique.

216
00:09:55,300 --> 00:09:56,280
Yeah, it is.

217
00:09:56,360 --> 00:09:58,230
It is unique. Nice though.

218
00:09:58,530 --> 00:09:59,500
Very nice.

219
00:09:59,900 --> 00:10:01,530
It's fatty too.

220
00:10:01,760 --> 00:10:03,900
-You don't get this in Japan.
-Yeah.

221
00:10:04,400 --> 00:10:05,380
They look nice.

222
00:10:05,460 --> 00:10:06,680
They look great.

223
00:10:06,760 --> 00:10:08,400
Tell me what you want.

224
00:10:09,330 --> 00:10:11,530
Look, they look beautiful.

225
00:10:13,960 --> 00:10:15,450
Shellfish look good.

226
00:10:15,530 --> 00:10:19,100
They say these chicken balls are nice.

227
00:10:19,260 --> 00:10:20,100
Really?

228
00:10:20,630 --> 00:10:23,600
Shall I get one each? One, two... seven.

229
00:10:28,400 --> 00:10:29,450
Let's eat.

230
00:10:29,530 --> 00:10:31,720
A saucy one should be good.

231
00:10:31,800 --> 00:10:33,160
What's the sauce?

232
00:10:34,260 --> 00:10:36,230
It's sweet and spicy.

233
00:10:37,600 --> 00:10:39,760
Each stall has their own recipe.

234
00:10:42,400 --> 00:10:43,320
Nice.

235
00:10:43,400 --> 00:10:45,450
-It's nice, huh?
-Yeah.

236
00:10:46,060 --> 00:10:49,050
-A bit spicy.
-Delicious.

237
00:10:49,360 --> 00:10:50,550
Hamada.

238
00:10:50,630 --> 00:10:52,200
We saw this earlier.

239
00:10:52,860 --> 00:10:53,680
Oh dear.

240
00:10:53,760 --> 00:10:56,660
In this night market, they sell...

241
00:10:58,100 --> 00:11:00,930
Crickets, caterpillars, etc.

242
00:11:01,260 --> 00:11:04,700
But I heard that the caterpillars taste great.

243
00:11:05,560 --> 00:11:06,760
Can I have one?

244
00:11:07,230 --> 00:11:08,230
One, okay?

245
00:11:13,830 --> 00:11:14,700
He ate it.

246
00:11:15,300 --> 00:11:16,400
It's delicious.

247
00:11:17,130 --> 00:11:18,960
Come on, don't be silly.

248
00:11:19,900 --> 00:11:20,760
Try it.

249
00:11:21,060 --> 00:11:22,530
-No thanks.
-Really?

250
00:11:23,600 --> 00:11:25,400
You're gonna get told off.

251
00:11:27,730 --> 00:11:28,480
It smells.

252
00:11:28,560 --> 00:11:30,330
It's a whole cricket.

253
00:11:30,960 --> 00:11:32,430
-A grasshopper?
-Yes.

254
00:11:32,730 --> 00:11:34,650
-Not a cricket?
-It's famous.

255
00:11:34,730 --> 00:11:35,800
Well?

256
00:11:39,100 --> 00:11:40,400
Wow, it's tasty.

257
00:11:41,030 --> 00:11:42,660
Seriously?

258
00:11:43,230 --> 00:11:45,230
I'll try one of them.

259
00:11:46,300 --> 00:11:47,350
They heat it up.

260
00:11:47,430 --> 00:11:48,500
I see.

261
00:11:49,260 --> 00:11:51,030
I hope they were cooked.

262
00:11:51,200 --> 00:11:52,700
He ate it uncooked?

263
00:11:53,560 --> 00:11:55,400
It had to be deep-fried.

264
00:11:56,230 --> 00:11:58,900
They were shocked.

265
00:11:59,700 --> 00:12:00,930
It tasted good.

266
00:12:02,660 --> 00:12:04,000
How much is it?

267
00:12:04,200 --> 00:12:05,330
It's 40 baht.

268
00:12:06,930 --> 00:12:09,600
Well, it actually smells really nice.

269
00:12:10,030 --> 00:12:11,800
Please try eating one.

270
00:12:12,100 --> 00:12:13,050
Come on then.

271
00:12:13,130 --> 00:12:14,500
Masayoshi, try one.

272
00:12:15,030 --> 00:12:15,930
Scoop it.

273
00:12:24,330 --> 00:12:26,260
Yum. It tastes good.

274
00:12:26,700 --> 00:12:27,550
How so?

275
00:12:27,630 --> 00:12:31,380
It's kind of like soft chicken cartilage.

276
00:12:31,460 --> 00:12:33,350
Does it burst and go slimy?

277
00:12:33,430 --> 00:12:35,960
Not at all. It's really easy to chew.

278
00:12:36,400 --> 00:12:37,520
Nice and plump.

279
00:12:37,600 --> 00:12:38,800
Inomoto, you try.

280
00:12:42,330 --> 00:12:43,400
Me?

281
00:12:45,030 --> 00:12:46,360
-Really?
-Yes, you.

282
00:12:55,560 --> 00:12:57,700
Well... I guess it's edible.

283
00:12:59,260 --> 00:13:00,400
It's good.

284
00:13:00,830 --> 00:13:02,300
Hamada, try it.

285
00:13:02,600 --> 00:13:04,280
It's quite edible.

286
00:13:04,360 --> 00:13:05,430
Stop it.

287
00:13:06,600 --> 00:13:07,820
Come on, come on.

288
00:13:07,900 --> 00:13:09,300
Have a cricket.

289
00:13:10,960 --> 00:13:12,060
Cricket?

290
00:13:13,060 --> 00:13:14,760
Sorry. It was my mistake.

291
00:13:23,960 --> 00:13:25,030
Nice aroma.

292
00:13:26,800 --> 00:13:29,100
It's edible, right? I told you.

293
00:13:29,500 --> 00:13:30,450
It wasn't bad.

294
00:13:30,530 --> 00:13:31,850
Crickets aren't bad.

295
00:13:31,930 --> 00:13:35,600
I mean, in Japan too,
some people eat grasshoppers.

296
00:13:36,500 --> 00:13:39,250
-I'm enjoying this market.
-It's fun.

297
00:13:39,330 --> 00:13:40,760
They sell everything.

298
00:13:41,630 --> 00:13:44,760
You come here to find out about Thailand.

299
00:13:45,830 --> 00:13:47,960
You can learn about their food.

300
00:13:48,430 --> 00:13:52,320
I was told that this rice was
popular with Thai people too.

301
00:13:52,600 --> 00:13:56,100
There's pork meat and egg on top of rice,

302
00:13:56,330 --> 00:13:58,100
like our rice bowls.

303
00:13:58,300 --> 00:13:59,430
It looks tasty.

304
00:13:59,660 --> 00:14:01,220
It's pork and egg.

305
00:14:01,300 --> 00:14:02,560
It looks tasty.

306
00:14:03,730 --> 00:14:05,220
Is it 60 bahts?

307
00:14:05,300 --> 00:14:06,860
The meat is tender.

308
00:14:07,000 --> 00:14:08,730
Shall we try it, yeah?

309
00:14:09,460 --> 00:14:11,300
And you get a boiled egg.

310
00:14:13,160 --> 00:14:15,180
You can't go wrong with this.

311
00:14:15,260 --> 00:14:16,760
I bet it's tasty.

312
00:14:18,760 --> 00:14:19,860
We got something.

313
00:14:20,830 --> 00:14:22,300
Gapao and green curry.

314
00:14:24,730 --> 00:14:25,900
It was 45 bahts.

315
00:14:26,360 --> 00:14:27,200
Was it?

316
00:14:32,330 --> 00:14:33,230
How is it?

317
00:14:35,160 --> 00:14:36,130
Nice.

318
00:14:37,730 --> 00:14:39,230
It's spicy again.

319
00:14:41,260 --> 00:14:43,100
It's good. Really good.

320
00:14:44,100 --> 00:14:46,150
Let's try this one.

321
00:14:46,230 --> 00:14:47,830
Hamada, try it.

322
00:14:48,460 --> 00:14:49,550
Looks so nice.

323
00:14:49,630 --> 00:14:51,420
Do I just eat it like this?

324
00:14:51,500 --> 00:14:53,350
There's rice underneath.

325
00:14:53,430 --> 00:14:55,100
I see.

326
00:14:55,260 --> 00:14:56,630
Try the meat first.

327
00:15:00,130 --> 00:15:01,460
Now this is good.

328
00:15:01,930 --> 00:15:03,050
Everyone likes it.

329
00:15:03,130 --> 00:15:04,380
You can't go wrong.

330
00:15:04,460 --> 00:15:07,760
It comes with rice and sauce to combine with.

331
00:15:08,130 --> 00:15:09,200
Sauce?

332
00:15:09,900 --> 00:15:11,180
Isn't it seasoned already?

333
00:15:11,260 --> 00:15:12,350
I like it a lot.

334
00:15:12,430 --> 00:15:14,200
It is seasoned, yes.

335
00:15:16,160 --> 00:15:19,630
It'd be even nicer with some more sauce.

336
00:15:20,030 --> 00:15:21,020
So tasty.

337
00:15:21,100 --> 00:15:22,260
Have more sauce.

338
00:15:22,460 --> 00:15:24,000
This is really tasty.

339
00:15:24,860 --> 00:15:25,900
So tasty.

340
00:15:28,130 --> 00:15:31,600
Hamada and the others
all enjoyed the night market.

341
00:15:36,230 --> 00:15:38,830
So what did you think of it, Hamada?

342
00:15:39,160 --> 00:15:42,500
I enjoyed the food. The atmosphere was fun too.

343
00:15:42,730 --> 00:15:44,930
Definitely feels like Thailand.

344
00:15:45,100 --> 00:15:47,700
He can't go to a market in Japan.

345
00:15:48,700 --> 00:15:50,900
I only see them on videos.

346
00:15:51,630 --> 00:15:53,280
I was skeptical.

347
00:15:53,360 --> 00:15:56,580
It's more fun in real life. I got you the sausage.

348
00:15:56,660 --> 00:15:57,700
Thanks.

349
00:16:02,400 --> 00:16:03,620
Did he like it?

350
00:16:03,700 --> 00:16:04,760
It's good.

351
00:16:05,300 --> 00:16:07,550
They were all tasty.

352
00:16:07,630 --> 00:16:11,430
I know, right? Everyone comes here.
A lot of the tourists.

353
00:16:12,000 --> 00:16:13,960
Ready for the next spot?

354
00:16:15,060 --> 00:16:19,030
Hirai of "Dorians"
had also presented another plan.

355
00:16:19,430 --> 00:16:21,560
-They all sound good.
-I agree.

356
00:16:21,700 --> 00:16:25,300
I guess the shops and things might be interesting.

357
00:16:27,760 --> 00:16:29,960
Really? OK, I understand.

358
00:16:30,730 --> 00:16:33,130
I'm sorry. Excuse me a moment.

359
00:16:34,860 --> 00:16:36,060
I'm sorry.

360
00:16:36,500 --> 00:16:37,600
Let me...

361
00:16:39,000 --> 00:16:40,660
You're like Steve Jobs.

362
00:16:41,130 --> 00:16:43,030
Is it Jobs' style today?

363
00:16:43,400 --> 00:16:46,760
-We can go to the night market...
-Hamada.

364
00:16:49,460 --> 00:16:50,460
Let's go.

365
00:16:50,860 --> 00:16:51,900
What was it?

366
00:16:52,030 --> 00:16:53,250
What did you see?

367
00:16:53,330 --> 00:16:54,550
Tell us what it was.

368
00:16:54,630 --> 00:16:56,300
What happened just now?

369
00:17:00,760 --> 00:17:01,700
Let's go.

370
00:17:02,330 --> 00:17:04,650
-Tell us what it was.
-Come on.

371
00:17:04,730 --> 00:17:06,230
Hamada, there's more.

372
00:17:06,760 --> 00:17:07,930
We're going!

373
00:17:08,860 --> 00:17:10,730
-Thank you!
-Let's go now!

374
00:17:10,960 --> 00:17:12,230
You got excited.

375
00:17:14,260 --> 00:17:15,930
Just tell us what it was.

376
00:17:18,460 --> 00:17:20,360
Nice. That's awesome.

377
00:17:20,660 --> 00:17:23,750
I'm glad I had it. And if...

378
00:17:23,900 --> 00:17:25,600
He loved it so much.

379
00:17:26,200 --> 00:17:27,900
He really loved it.

380
00:17:28,220 --> 00:17:29,630
Let's go!

381
00:17:29,900 --> 00:17:31,360
He's so different now.

382
00:17:31,960 --> 00:17:33,450
Okay, let's go then.

383
00:17:33,530 --> 00:17:35,450
Let's go. He's hyper now.

384
00:17:37,300 --> 00:17:41,330
They head out to have some nighttime fun.

385
00:17:43,100 --> 00:17:47,250
This is the biggest
entertainment district in Pattaya.

386
00:17:47,360 --> 00:17:49,900
Awesome.

387
00:17:50,000 --> 00:17:52,200
It's a strange atmosphere.

388
00:17:52,950 --> 00:17:55,360
-Very Southeast Asia.
-Right?

389
00:17:56,100 --> 00:17:57,030
Exotic.

390
00:17:57,630 --> 00:18:02,460
It reminds me of Kabukicho in Tokyo
from around 30 years ago.

391
00:18:03,230 --> 00:18:05,630
That shop has a sign saying "Taboo."

392
00:18:06,260 --> 00:18:08,600
It looks suspicious. What is it?

393
00:18:09,460 --> 00:18:11,660
What a place.

394
00:18:13,230 --> 00:18:14,600
What is this place?

395
00:18:15,360 --> 00:18:16,530
Bright red.

396
00:18:16,900 --> 00:18:17,980
So many lights.

397
00:18:18,060 --> 00:18:21,030
That woman must be the negotiator.

398
00:18:21,830 --> 00:18:23,000
Look there.

399
00:18:25,200 --> 00:18:26,860
It's a famous go-go bar.

400
00:18:27,400 --> 00:18:28,660
A go-go bar.

401
00:18:29,430 --> 00:18:30,600
This is it.

402
00:18:30,900 --> 00:18:34,950
You can't see it from the outside. You have to go in.

403
00:18:36,550 --> 00:18:38,650
It's so long.

404
00:18:39,050 --> 00:18:40,260
It goes on.

405
00:18:43,730 --> 00:18:44,960
This is amazing.

406
00:18:45,200 --> 00:18:47,700
That guy is advertising happy hour.

407
00:18:50,100 --> 00:18:51,360
Wow, amazing.

408
00:18:51,800 --> 00:18:53,660
She's got a tummy like mine.

409
00:18:55,200 --> 00:18:56,920
It's an ice cream stall.

410
00:18:57,000 --> 00:18:58,800
-Yeah?
-They tease you.

411
00:18:59,560 --> 00:19:02,530
They find a Turkish ice cream shop.

412
00:19:08,730 --> 00:19:09,760
Wow.

413
00:19:14,260 --> 00:19:15,400
It touched me.

414
00:19:15,900 --> 00:19:16,830
Oh wow.

415
00:19:17,260 --> 00:19:18,330
It touched me.

416
00:19:35,160 --> 00:19:36,200
Oh come on.

417
00:19:36,330 --> 00:19:37,460
Hey, hey.

418
00:19:40,830 --> 00:19:41,960
You're too funny.

419
00:19:43,200 --> 00:19:44,330
Wonderful.

420
00:19:45,100 --> 00:19:47,020
I'm really impressed.

421
00:19:47,100 --> 00:19:50,600
-Awesome, huh?
-The Internet can't tell you half the story.

422
00:19:50,800 --> 00:19:54,160
They went deeper into the night scene.

423
00:19:55,060 --> 00:19:57,400
Don't go there. They're all men.

424
00:19:57,830 --> 00:19:59,830
No, Hamada, don't go.

425
00:20:00,200 --> 00:20:01,400
They're all men?

426
00:20:02,100 --> 00:20:03,400
I'm going alone?

427
00:20:04,050 --> 00:20:05,400
Wait...

428
00:20:05,550 --> 00:20:09,530
Masayoshi goes alone into
a shop full of middle-aged men.

429
00:20:12,440 --> 00:20:13,660
You're mean.

430
00:20:15,050 --> 00:20:16,530
This is so mean.

431
00:20:16,830 --> 00:20:19,360
There are eight guys in swim shorts.

432
00:20:20,330 --> 00:20:23,650
This place is dangerous. I can't go in.

433
00:20:23,860 --> 00:20:25,250
They're all men.

434
00:20:25,330 --> 00:20:26,850
Girls are at the back.

435
00:20:26,930 --> 00:20:28,360
No, they're all men.

436
00:20:28,630 --> 00:20:29,800
Go to the back.

437
00:20:31,100 --> 00:20:32,220
They're there.

438
00:20:32,300 --> 00:20:33,260
They're not.

439
00:20:33,860 --> 00:20:35,430
There they are.

440
00:20:36,030 --> 00:20:37,080
I knew it.

441
00:20:37,160 --> 00:20:40,400
No, that's a man in a blond wig.

442
00:20:42,550 --> 00:20:43,800
They're men.

443
00:20:44,600 --> 00:20:45,660
Only men.

444
00:20:46,430 --> 00:20:51,100
They sent Masayoshi alone to the shop
and enjoyed the night life.

445
00:20:52,960 --> 00:20:59,050
So, Hamada gave first place
for the best presentation to this guy.

446
00:21:00,530 --> 00:21:01,930
Are you ready guys?

447
00:21:02,060 --> 00:21:04,430
-You'll announce the winner?
-Yes.

448
00:21:04,600 --> 00:21:08,300
-Please announce the winner.
-Alright.

449
00:21:09,960 --> 00:21:11,130
Close your eyes.

450
00:21:11,960 --> 00:21:15,230
The winner gets 3,000 bahts.

451
00:21:19,000 --> 00:21:21,530
The winner of the 3,000 bahts is...

452
00:21:25,260 --> 00:21:27,000
-Sam.
-Sam?

453
00:21:28,400 --> 00:21:29,600
Sam?

454
00:21:30,050 --> 00:21:32,550
Huh? Who the hell?

455
00:21:32,650 --> 00:21:34,550
Sam? What?

456
00:21:36,200 --> 00:21:38,800
-Sam?
-Yes.

457
00:21:38,930 --> 00:21:40,160
For Sam?

458
00:21:40,660 --> 00:21:42,560
Give this to Sam for me.

459
00:21:45,300 --> 00:21:46,450
Sheesh.

460
00:21:46,530 --> 00:21:49,560
I'm giving 3,000 bahts to Sam?

461
00:21:50,300 --> 00:21:51,400
Give it to him.

462
00:21:52,200 --> 00:21:54,830
Sam worked the hardest by far.

463
00:21:57,600 --> 00:21:58,500
It's true.

464
00:21:59,160 --> 00:22:01,300
I think he worked hard too.

465
00:22:02,800 --> 00:22:06,660
Who is this Sam who won first place?

466
00:22:08,100 --> 00:22:12,250
This was four hours after
Masayoshi was abandoned in the shop.

467
00:22:12,330 --> 00:22:15,050
Hey wait. There's something odd.

468
00:22:15,260 --> 00:22:16,860
He seems different.

469
00:22:17,000 --> 00:22:18,960
He has more presence.

470
00:22:19,400 --> 00:22:20,530
What's going on?

471
00:22:20,960 --> 00:22:23,700
To put it politely, he looked like...

472
00:22:23,790 --> 00:22:25,000
Guts Ishimatsu.

473
00:22:26,500 --> 00:22:29,600
Initially, we couldn't communicate at all.

474
00:22:30,230 --> 00:22:32,150
-No English?
-Nope.

475
00:22:32,500 --> 00:22:34,300
-No English at all.
-That's scary.

476
00:22:34,560 --> 00:22:36,450
He didn't speak English?

477
00:22:37,460 --> 00:22:38,800
That's tough.

478
00:22:39,060 --> 00:22:40,750
That's really tough.

479
00:22:40,900 --> 00:22:43,200
He understood "What's your name?"

480
00:22:43,760 --> 00:22:45,900
He told me he was "Sam."

481
00:22:46,400 --> 00:22:49,230
Sam

482
00:22:49,360 --> 00:22:50,400
Sam!

483
00:22:50,500 --> 00:22:53,130
He wanted to show me something.

484
00:22:54,230 --> 00:22:55,080
What was it?

485
00:22:55,160 --> 00:22:59,500
There's this traditional dance in Thailand.

486
00:23:00,330 --> 00:23:02,530
He started dancing it.

487
00:23:03,430 --> 00:23:04,680
It makes no sense.

488
00:23:04,760 --> 00:23:08,150
That's a bit sudden.

489
00:23:10,100 --> 00:23:11,660
He started dancing.

490
00:23:12,900 --> 00:23:14,300
Right in front of me.

491
00:23:15,530 --> 00:23:17,420
-Sam did?
-In front of me.

492
00:23:17,500 --> 00:23:19,600
I asked him to take a shower.

493
00:23:20,500 --> 00:23:21,580
What did he say?

494
00:23:21,660 --> 00:23:22,760
He said no.

495
00:23:27,030 --> 00:23:28,320
He won't shower?

496
00:23:28,400 --> 00:23:30,050
No way.

497
00:23:31,000 --> 00:23:35,150
Masayoshi talked about Sam passionately.

498
00:23:39,300 --> 00:23:44,050
Seriously? Unbelievable!

499
00:23:44,200 --> 00:23:45,430
Wonderful.

500
00:23:45,800 --> 00:23:48,300
-What a great experience.
-Yeah.

501
00:23:48,600 --> 00:23:50,230
Sorry I went on my own.

502
00:23:51,130 --> 00:23:53,100
More like I came on my own.

503
00:23:56,300 --> 00:23:57,430
That's enough.

504
00:23:58,160 --> 00:23:59,230
Enough.

505
00:24:00,600 --> 00:24:02,450
Hirai and Seshita, kiss.

506
00:24:04,560 --> 00:24:06,030
On this journey,

507
00:24:06,200 --> 00:24:10,230
it became a rule to kiss
and make up after an argument.

508
00:24:12,560 --> 00:24:14,480
Through physical contact,

509
00:24:14,560 --> 00:24:18,000
they became even closer to each other.

510
00:24:22,230 --> 00:24:24,100
He's so sweaty.

511
00:24:27,400 --> 00:24:29,800
Overall, you all did very well.

512
00:24:29,880 --> 00:24:31,150
Thank you very much!

513
00:24:31,230 --> 00:24:32,460
It's been great.

514
00:24:32,900 --> 00:24:35,230
This is how I want you to perform.

515
00:24:35,430 --> 00:24:38,000
I consider this to be a start.

516
00:24:38,100 --> 00:24:40,000
-Thank you.
-Lastly...

517
00:24:40,330 --> 00:24:42,230
Make it big as comedians!

518
00:24:43,900 --> 00:24:44,740
Ouch.

519
00:24:44,960 --> 00:24:48,400
We're trying. We really are.

520
00:24:48,800 --> 00:24:50,200
How old are you?

521
00:24:50,330 --> 00:24:51,350
I'm 38.

522
00:24:51,430 --> 00:24:52,280
I'm 39.

523
00:24:52,360 --> 00:24:53,200
I'm 39 too.

524
00:24:53,360 --> 00:24:54,360
39.

525
00:24:54,500 --> 00:24:55,600
I'm 38.

526
00:24:56,300 --> 00:24:57,700
You're old geezers.

527
00:24:59,130 --> 00:25:01,100
We're still rookies.

528
00:25:01,230 --> 00:25:02,680
You're not rookies.

529
00:25:02,760 --> 00:25:03,680
Yes we are.

530
00:25:03,760 --> 00:25:05,560
At the age of 40?

531
00:25:05,860 --> 00:25:08,560
Yeah, we're all rookies.

532
00:25:09,060 --> 00:25:13,880
Use this as an opportunity to do better.
Now you know how TV works.

533
00:25:13,960 --> 00:25:15,300
Yes, we do.

534
00:25:15,400 --> 00:25:18,530
I think you guys learned a lot on this trip.

535
00:25:18,960 --> 00:25:22,630
If you want people to listen to you more,

536
00:25:22,930 --> 00:25:24,600
use two microphones.

537
00:25:26,360 --> 00:25:29,130
You sure? I'll take your word for it.

538
00:25:30,330 --> 00:25:33,300
There was an incident related to microphones.

539
00:25:37,400 --> 00:25:38,880
Shall we go with that?

540
00:25:38,960 --> 00:25:41,660
Hamada, you're wearing my mic.

541
00:25:42,130 --> 00:25:42,950
Is it yours?

542
00:25:43,030 --> 00:25:44,960
You're wearing my mic.

543
00:25:47,350 --> 00:25:50,000
He was desperate to be heard.

544
00:25:50,600 --> 00:25:53,150
I want to talk too.

545
00:25:53,760 --> 00:25:55,660
You're so desperate?

546
00:25:55,740 --> 00:25:57,050
He thought it was his.

547
00:25:57,130 --> 00:26:01,250
I dropped it and before I picked it up, he put it on.

548
00:26:01,960 --> 00:26:04,400
Why did he think it was his?

549
00:26:05,730 --> 00:26:06,920
He didn't drop it.

550
00:26:07,000 --> 00:26:10,460
I've been moving but Hamada was just sitting.

551
00:26:10,930 --> 00:26:13,130
When would you have dropped it?

552
00:26:13,460 --> 00:26:15,830
He stole the mic off me.

553
00:26:16,000 --> 00:26:18,600
Use your own mic.

554
00:26:18,760 --> 00:26:20,850
I've worked on many shows,

555
00:26:20,950 --> 00:26:24,160
but I've never seen someone put on two mics.

556
00:26:29,460 --> 00:26:32,200
I saw the sound girl adjusting levels.

557
00:26:32,650 --> 00:26:34,200
It was a double feed.

558
00:26:34,600 --> 00:26:36,230
She looked confused.

559
00:26:36,760 --> 00:26:38,100
The frequency...

560
00:26:38,200 --> 00:26:39,560
Look at this one.

561
00:26:42,130 --> 00:26:43,130
It all on me.

562
00:26:44,860 --> 00:26:47,300
Even showbiz people have never seen

563
00:26:47,460 --> 00:26:50,830
anyone putting two microphones on themselves.

564
00:26:54,800 --> 00:26:58,830
It was my first time in 13 years
working as a sound engineer.

565
00:27:01,800 --> 00:27:05,430
I wasn't sure what had happened. It was a shock.

566
00:27:07,400 --> 00:27:09,200
I did it on purpose.

567
00:27:09,400 --> 00:27:11,430
-On purpose?
-Of course.

568
00:27:11,660 --> 00:27:13,320
You did it on purpose?

569
00:27:13,400 --> 00:27:15,600
-Of course.
-So you're heard?

570
00:27:15,830 --> 00:27:17,680
Of course. Don't be silly.

571
00:27:17,760 --> 00:27:20,560
You're gonna rip my face off.

572
00:27:20,750 --> 00:27:22,950
That's bad.

573
00:27:23,160 --> 00:27:27,230
I heard him saying earlier, "Why did I put that on?"

574
00:27:29,330 --> 00:27:31,400
I said, "You were sleepy?"

575
00:27:33,800 --> 00:27:34,930
Apologize.

576
00:27:36,000 --> 00:27:37,100
I refuse.

577
00:27:37,330 --> 00:27:39,630
You've got to apologize, come on.

578
00:27:40,930 --> 00:27:43,900
You should both apologize.

579
00:27:44,100 --> 00:27:45,100
Come on.

580
00:27:45,400 --> 00:27:46,460
Don't fight.

581
00:27:46,730 --> 00:27:51,650
That's how eager you should be
to make it big in showbiz.

582
00:27:51,800 --> 00:27:52,860
Mr Two-mic.

583
00:27:55,760 --> 00:27:56,550
This guy...

584
00:27:56,630 --> 00:27:59,450
-Don't call him "this guy."
-Yeah, don't.

585
00:28:00,030 --> 00:28:03,900
-You should kiss and make up.
-Let's put this behind us.

586
00:28:04,060 --> 00:28:08,700
Come on, kiss. You had an argument.

587
00:28:09,250 --> 00:28:10,900
I didn't argue with him.

588
00:28:11,030 --> 00:28:12,260
I didn't.

589
00:28:13,500 --> 00:28:14,800
Make up with him.

590
00:28:18,000 --> 00:28:20,550
What the hell?

591
00:28:20,900 --> 00:28:22,360
This is the ending?

592
00:28:22,600 --> 00:28:25,950
A nice country, Thailand.

593
00:28:26,230 --> 00:28:28,030
Thank you, Thailand.

594
00:28:28,200 --> 00:28:30,100
Bye!

595
00:28:31,530 --> 00:28:35,530
In the past, we went to Guam a lot.

596
00:28:36,000 --> 00:28:39,100
But in this trip, the scenery was spectacular.

597
00:28:39,760 --> 00:28:44,600
So I'd like to search for more places like that.

598
00:28:44,760 --> 00:28:48,600
We run out of places to go
if we visit the same place.

599
00:28:49,030 --> 00:28:51,800
I want to see the footage from this trip,

600
00:28:52,030 --> 00:28:54,660
because I'm sure it's spectacular.

601
00:28:55,100 --> 00:28:58,360
So I'll look for more nice places.

602
00:28:58,560 --> 00:29:00,980
I can't say where right now.

603
00:29:01,060 --> 00:29:03,620
I'm interested to see...

604
00:29:03,700 --> 00:29:07,560
...what they'll achieve when
that bunch gets together again.
