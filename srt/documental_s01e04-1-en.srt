1
00:00:13,220 --> 00:00:16,870
THIS PROGRAM IS THE RECORD
OF A "BATTLE" AMONGST COMEDIANS.

2
00:00:16,960 --> 00:00:19,830
IN ORDER TO PRESERVE QUALITY,
IT IS MOSTLY UNEDITED.

3
00:00:19,900 --> 00:00:22,530
AS SUCH, VIEWERS MAY ENCOUNTER
EXPLICIT CONTENT.

4
00:00:25,890 --> 00:00:30,900
They might have a strong desire
to win 10 million yen.

5
00:00:31,220 --> 00:00:36,270
Or maybe they just don't want
to lose their one million yen.

6
00:00:37,290 --> 00:00:40,430
I'm sure each participant
has his own motivation.

7
00:00:40,920 --> 00:00:44,470
For someone like Toro Salmon's Kubota,

8
00:00:44,820 --> 00:00:48,140
one million yen must have been
a lot of money to prepare.

9
00:00:48,960 --> 00:00:51,700
For well-known comedians like Fujimoto,

10
00:00:51,750 --> 00:00:56,240
he's probably not as concerned about money
as he once was.

11
00:00:56,630 --> 00:00:59,040
I think that will be a big factor.

12
00:02:11,350 --> 00:02:14,330
-You don't need 10 million yen, Fujimoto.
-Yes, I do!

13
00:02:14,560 --> 00:02:16,600
-Don't lie.
-That has nothing to do with this.

14
00:02:16,690 --> 00:02:17,900
You already have enough.

15
00:02:18,190 --> 00:02:20,160
You can never have enough money.

16
00:02:20,820 --> 00:02:23,130
And this is no small change.
It's 10 million yen.

17
00:02:23,460 --> 00:02:25,330
-It's a lot.
-It's too much.

18
00:02:25,390 --> 00:02:27,740
Are you getting philosophical?
I'm off to the bathroom.

19
00:02:27,790 --> 00:02:29,030
It's 10 million.

20
00:02:29,260 --> 00:02:30,960
Ten million is a lot.

21
00:02:31,050 --> 00:02:32,470
This may be the difference.

22
00:02:32,790 --> 00:02:34,670
And I have a family.

23
00:02:34,890 --> 00:02:37,770
-You do.
-But your wife earns a lot of money too.

24
00:02:37,860 --> 00:02:39,300
-You say so yourself.
-But--

25
00:02:39,360 --> 00:02:40,700
"My wife earns big."

26
00:02:40,750 --> 00:02:42,060
A man has his pride.

27
00:02:42,120 --> 00:02:45,270
You're always talking about
how shockingly large her salary is.

28
00:02:45,460 --> 00:02:47,300
When you compare it to Yoshimoto's rate.

29
00:02:51,490 --> 00:02:54,000
Right? Only compared to Yoshimoto.

30
00:03:01,890 --> 00:03:04,370
You can never have enough money.

31
00:03:04,860 --> 00:03:06,840
Who knows what will happen in the future?

32
00:03:07,060 --> 00:03:09,960
Name a comedian
who's still popular in his fifties.

33
00:03:10,350 --> 00:03:11,630
Are there any?

34
00:03:11,990 --> 00:03:13,530
In their fifties, or sixties...

35
00:03:13,760 --> 00:03:14,900
There aren't many.

36
00:03:14,960 --> 00:03:17,440
How about the guy who always says,
"How tasty"?

37
00:03:20,200 --> 00:03:22,770
-Is Ishizuka that old?
-Around 50, I think.

38
00:03:23,490 --> 00:03:26,940
But I heard that when he does
those gourmet reports,

39
00:03:28,890 --> 00:03:31,300
he leaves a lot of food.

40
00:03:31,720 --> 00:03:33,700
-Why say that?
-He only takes two bites.

41
00:03:34,020 --> 00:03:35,030
He laughed!

42
00:03:35,090 --> 00:03:36,240
Right?

43
00:03:39,700 --> 00:03:42,130
That was... All I did was cough.

44
00:03:43,460 --> 00:03:45,170
Should we review the video?

45
00:03:45,360 --> 00:03:47,600
All I did was cough.

46
00:03:47,730 --> 00:03:49,800
You have to give me a break on that one.

47
00:03:50,920 --> 00:03:55,030
-The chef said he hardly touched the meal.
-Don't be so disrespectful to Ishizuka.

48
00:03:55,090 --> 00:03:56,140
But he said--

49
00:03:56,190 --> 00:03:57,940
Fujimoto. Orange.

50
00:03:57,990 --> 00:03:59,460
You have no more chances.

51
00:03:59,830 --> 00:04:01,400
We all heard the "Hmph!"

52
00:04:01,490 --> 00:04:02,870
You laughed from your belly.

53
00:04:04,760 --> 00:04:06,900
Anthony has a yellow card.

54
00:04:07,360 --> 00:04:09,530
-And these two still have no cards.
-None.

55
00:04:09,830 --> 00:04:12,260
-I let my guard down.
-You did.

56
00:04:12,560 --> 00:04:13,500
Let's focus!

57
00:04:13,720 --> 00:04:14,830
That gets a card?

58
00:04:19,530 --> 00:04:21,230
Kawahara, do you ever laugh?

59
00:04:22,620 --> 00:04:24,370
I've never seen you smile.

60
00:04:24,490 --> 00:04:26,140
-Neither have I.
-Never.

61
00:04:26,430 --> 00:04:28,840
-Don't you ever laugh?
-Of course I do.

62
00:04:29,360 --> 00:04:31,300
What made you laugh the hardest?

63
00:04:32,420 --> 00:04:34,530
The thing made me laugh the hardest was

64
00:04:35,490 --> 00:04:36,940
the TV show Gaki no Tsukai.

65
00:04:41,090 --> 00:04:42,370
That's a funny show.

66
00:04:43,020 --> 00:04:44,530
-Yes.
-Of course it's funny.

67
00:04:44,660 --> 00:04:45,840
That's about it.

68
00:04:46,090 --> 00:04:50,530
To make others laugh,
without laughing yourself...

69
00:04:50,790 --> 00:04:53,170
I've never used my brain like that before.

70
00:04:53,290 --> 00:04:56,940
Of course, I want to make them laugh,

71
00:04:57,160 --> 00:05:00,560
so I'll seize every opportunity.

72
00:05:00,890 --> 00:05:02,030
How do you laugh?

73
00:05:02,190 --> 00:05:03,630
Show me your smile.

74
00:05:03,720 --> 00:05:05,030
But then I'd lose.

75
00:05:08,430 --> 00:05:11,100
You'd still be in the game
even if you got a yellow card.

76
00:05:15,930 --> 00:05:17,770
Just once, then.

77
00:05:17,960 --> 00:05:19,460
-You will?
-Are you sure?

78
00:05:19,530 --> 00:05:21,230
I won't get a red card, right?

79
00:05:21,420 --> 00:05:23,630
-No.
-Yellow first, right?

80
00:05:23,820 --> 00:05:24,770
Really?

81
00:05:25,090 --> 00:05:26,500
If you say so.

82
00:05:26,560 --> 00:05:29,660
-Well, that's quite manly of you.
-Wow.

83
00:05:29,730 --> 00:05:31,700
-He's a real man.
-Sure is.

84
00:05:31,750 --> 00:05:34,400
Use this to hide your face,
then flash it at us.

85
00:05:35,060 --> 00:05:37,970
-Ready?
-Wait! He'll just make a funny face.

86
00:05:38,860 --> 00:05:39,960
He'll make us laugh.

87
00:05:40,120 --> 00:05:42,130
Well, it's a game of funny faces.

88
00:05:42,220 --> 00:05:44,100
Wait. You guys watch, too.

89
00:05:44,160 --> 00:05:45,840
-Of course.
-We're watching.

90
00:05:46,290 --> 00:05:47,400
Ready?

91
00:06:02,460 --> 00:06:03,730
Which of them was it?

92
00:06:03,920 --> 00:06:07,300
-Who was it?
-Not me! It has to be him!

93
00:06:09,160 --> 00:06:10,730
Don't laugh out loud!

94
00:06:12,560 --> 00:06:14,330
He laughed right before the siren.

95
00:06:14,420 --> 00:06:17,070
No, I didn't. I laughed after the siren.

96
00:06:22,150 --> 00:06:23,270
Yellow card.

97
00:06:25,830 --> 00:06:28,540
-Fujimoto laughed after the siren.
-See?

98
00:06:29,030 --> 00:06:30,900
-That was close.
-You were on the edge.

99
00:06:31,020 --> 00:06:33,000
Everyone could've laughed just now.

100
00:06:33,090 --> 00:06:34,830
There was the possibility.

101
00:06:35,060 --> 00:06:36,670
That's what I was aiming for.

102
00:06:37,230 --> 00:06:38,740
That was so close.

103
00:06:39,160 --> 00:06:41,430
I thought he wouldn't make a face at all.

104
00:06:41,520 --> 00:06:43,000
I thought so, too.

105
00:06:43,660 --> 00:06:45,370
But he gave us a full on laugh.

106
00:06:45,420 --> 00:06:47,100
It was so unlike him.

107
00:06:52,620 --> 00:06:53,800
You're scary.

108
00:06:59,160 --> 00:07:00,360
That was scary.

109
00:07:01,650 --> 00:07:02,770
I'm hungry.

110
00:07:03,090 --> 00:07:05,200
-They have ramen.
-I want some, too.

111
00:07:05,360 --> 00:07:07,400
-You want ramen?
-Yeah!

112
00:07:07,690 --> 00:07:09,100
That's just what I wanted.

113
00:07:11,190 --> 00:07:12,530
Just what you wanted?

114
00:07:13,020 --> 00:07:14,200
"Just what I wanted."

115
00:07:14,720 --> 00:07:15,800
You laughed.

116
00:07:18,430 --> 00:07:19,860
Didn't he laugh?

117
00:07:21,850 --> 00:07:24,030
-He laughed as he did an impression.
-Right?

118
00:07:24,220 --> 00:07:27,000
All I said is that it was
"Just what I wanted."

119
00:07:27,090 --> 00:07:28,540
Who's that supposed to be?

120
00:07:29,300 --> 00:07:30,860
Can I boil some sausages?

121
00:07:31,050 --> 00:07:33,270
-Will you cook something?
-I'll just boil them.

122
00:07:33,360 --> 00:07:35,600
-Cook us something.
-Something proper.

123
00:07:36,060 --> 00:07:37,770
-You're not eating, Kawahara?
-No.

124
00:07:37,890 --> 00:07:39,560
-Why not?
-I'm not hungry.

125
00:07:40,090 --> 00:07:42,330
-He's full because he had wine.
-That's right.

126
00:07:42,390 --> 00:07:43,930
I had a bit of wine.

127
00:07:43,990 --> 00:07:45,770
There's still some left.

128
00:07:49,260 --> 00:07:50,330
This is good!

129
00:07:51,020 --> 00:07:52,570
-That must be good.
-It's good.

130
00:07:52,620 --> 00:07:53,830
I bet it is.

131
00:07:57,960 --> 00:07:58,830
Delicious.

132
00:07:59,630 --> 00:08:01,330
You don't need to stare at me.

133
00:08:01,420 --> 00:08:02,930
But it's really good.

134
00:08:03,990 --> 00:08:06,270
You say everything is good.

135
00:08:06,490 --> 00:08:07,740
No, I don't.

136
00:08:07,890 --> 00:08:10,930
When we did that sausage gig together,
you said they were so good,

137
00:08:10,990 --> 00:08:12,400
you ate about 20 of them.

138
00:08:14,860 --> 00:08:16,300
We did a sausage gig.

139
00:08:16,390 --> 00:08:18,470
-Twenty sausages?
-Yes, 20 sausages.

140
00:08:18,760 --> 00:08:20,100
That many?

141
00:08:20,390 --> 00:08:22,200
Can you stop saying "sausage gig"?

142
00:08:22,460 --> 00:08:23,900
But it was a sausage gig.

143
00:08:24,190 --> 00:08:28,270
-I've never heard of a "sausage gig."
-It was a gig for a sausage company.

144
00:08:28,930 --> 00:08:30,030
That was good.

145
00:08:31,020 --> 00:08:32,370
-Well...
-Delicious.

146
00:08:32,760 --> 00:08:37,700
Kubota, doesn't this remind you
of when we were neighbors?

147
00:08:37,890 --> 00:08:39,330
In Kita-ikebukuro.

148
00:08:40,350 --> 00:08:42,060
It's a town most people don't know.

149
00:08:42,120 --> 00:08:43,200
People know it!

150
00:08:46,530 --> 00:08:48,830
Why are my noodles still uncooked?

151
00:08:49,600 --> 00:08:51,560
Just leave it for a while longer.

152
00:08:52,390 --> 00:08:54,630
-It's been over three minutes.
-You don't say?

153
00:08:55,120 --> 00:08:56,640
What kind of response is that?

154
00:08:58,430 --> 00:09:00,330
-You're going to fry them?
-It's tastier.

155
00:09:00,390 --> 00:09:02,230
-Better than boiling, right?
-I want one.

156
00:09:02,290 --> 00:09:03,770
Right... What?

157
00:09:04,190 --> 00:09:05,970
-You said you weren't hungry.
-You did.

158
00:09:06,030 --> 00:09:08,000
If it's sausages, I want one, too.

159
00:09:10,050 --> 00:09:11,260
Damn.

160
00:09:11,820 --> 00:09:13,400
He's trying to pick a fight.

161
00:09:13,560 --> 00:09:15,070
No, I'm not.

162
00:09:16,560 --> 00:09:18,100
You said you wouldn't eat.

163
00:09:20,920 --> 00:09:22,260
That looks so good.

164
00:09:25,760 --> 00:09:27,970
My noodles are still uncooked.

165
00:09:28,530 --> 00:09:29,660
What is this?

166
00:09:30,750 --> 00:09:32,100
This is so annoying.

167
00:09:32,560 --> 00:09:34,400
They're so stiff.

168
00:09:36,130 --> 00:09:37,440
They're stiff.

169
00:09:37,660 --> 00:09:38,800
Why?

170
00:09:38,990 --> 00:09:40,330
It's been five minutes!

171
00:09:41,290 --> 00:09:42,830
Are the noodles too thick?

172
00:09:43,260 --> 00:09:45,000
Wasn't the water boiled?

173
00:09:46,730 --> 00:09:47,940
But it tastes great!

174
00:09:49,360 --> 00:09:50,800
They're stiff but great!

175
00:09:53,820 --> 00:09:56,140
-The aftertaste is awful!
-Shut up!

176
00:09:56,390 --> 00:09:58,270
I don't know how to cut these.

177
00:09:59,030 --> 00:10:00,560
These look good. Look.

178
00:10:00,820 --> 00:10:03,270
-These must be delicious.
-Whoa!

179
00:10:03,560 --> 00:10:04,830
Must be good.

180
00:10:05,590 --> 00:10:06,870
You found the chopsticks.

181
00:10:10,850 --> 00:10:11,860
That looks good.

182
00:10:16,460 --> 00:10:18,630
I didn't know instant noodles
could be this good.

183
00:10:18,690 --> 00:10:19,730
Yum.

184
00:10:23,720 --> 00:10:24,770
Wow.

185
00:10:25,560 --> 00:10:27,870
-That one doesn't work.
-Yeah, it won't turn on.

186
00:10:29,160 --> 00:10:30,900
It doesn't turn on. Use this one.

187
00:10:31,550 --> 00:10:32,630
Whoa.

188
00:10:34,260 --> 00:10:36,270
-You're gonna make pasta?
-Yes.

189
00:10:36,990 --> 00:10:38,070
Why?

190
00:10:39,460 --> 00:10:40,330
Yummy.

191
00:10:40,550 --> 00:10:41,600
Want some?

192
00:10:42,220 --> 00:10:45,170
Well, if it tastes good.

193
00:10:45,260 --> 00:10:47,600
-Did you work in a restaurant?
-No.

194
00:10:47,730 --> 00:10:49,330
What's your best pasta dish?

195
00:10:50,090 --> 00:10:52,030
It's an original recipe.

196
00:10:56,560 --> 00:10:59,330
-How old were you?
-I was in kindergarten.

197
00:10:59,400 --> 00:11:00,660
I grew up fast.

198
00:11:07,930 --> 00:11:09,030
Hm?

199
00:11:18,590 --> 00:11:19,730
Who laughed?

200
00:11:21,850 --> 00:11:22,830
Who was it?

201
00:11:26,460 --> 00:11:27,440
No idea.

202
00:11:45,460 --> 00:11:46,240
Anthony.

203
00:11:49,200 --> 00:11:50,300
You smiled, right?

204
00:11:51,390 --> 00:11:53,630
I thought I held it back.

205
00:11:54,790 --> 00:11:57,200
He was eating and smiling
like a normal dinner.

206
00:12:01,050 --> 00:12:02,100
How old were you?

207
00:12:02,150 --> 00:12:03,800
I was in kindergarten.

208
00:12:03,920 --> 00:12:05,100
I grew up fast.

209
00:12:12,620 --> 00:12:14,330
You seemed to be having fun.

210
00:12:15,590 --> 00:12:17,570
THE JUDGING IS STRICTER
NOW THAT HALF ARE GONE

211
00:12:17,630 --> 00:12:19,030
Orange, right?

212
00:12:19,130 --> 00:12:20,100
Okay.

213
00:12:20,320 --> 00:12:22,400
-I'll be stricter from here on out.
-Okay.

214
00:12:22,660 --> 00:12:25,470
Fujimoto and Anthony have orange cards.

215
00:12:25,790 --> 00:12:27,100
He's on yellow.

216
00:12:27,190 --> 00:12:28,240
Yes.

217
00:12:28,290 --> 00:12:29,500
He's still clear.

218
00:12:29,550 --> 00:12:31,360
-No cards yet?
-I'm done for.

219
00:12:31,750 --> 00:12:34,000
-Does he really not have a card?
-It's true.

220
00:12:34,160 --> 00:12:37,270
-You won't win if you're not aggressive.
-Okay!

221
00:12:42,920 --> 00:12:44,400
Kubota hasn't smiled yet.

222
00:12:44,590 --> 00:12:47,140
I think it would be nice
if everyone knew me better.

223
00:12:47,190 --> 00:12:50,060
So, would you mind
looking at some of my old photos?

224
00:12:50,350 --> 00:12:52,030
My plan?

225
00:12:52,190 --> 00:12:56,500
I guess, above all,
my looks are my strength.

226
00:12:57,090 --> 00:12:58,400
As you can see,

227
00:12:58,460 --> 00:13:02,500
I'll probably be the only one
of a difference race.

228
00:13:03,220 --> 00:13:06,600
So, I want to use that to my advantage.

229
00:13:07,630 --> 00:13:11,600
-When were the photos taken?
-Back in my early schooldays.

230
00:13:12,120 --> 00:13:13,700
My first day of grade school.

231
00:13:14,160 --> 00:13:16,970
-Old photos of you?
-Yes, please take a look.

232
00:13:18,660 --> 00:13:20,200
My graduation from grade school.

233
00:13:20,350 --> 00:13:21,400
Oh, my.

234
00:13:24,860 --> 00:13:26,270
This is my dad.

235
00:13:26,330 --> 00:13:27,940
The American one.

236
00:13:31,020 --> 00:13:33,200
-Fujimoto, please take a look.
-Who's this?

237
00:13:34,020 --> 00:13:36,040
That is my American dad.

238
00:13:36,230 --> 00:13:37,370
Victor.

239
00:13:37,430 --> 00:13:38,660
Professor Victor?

240
00:13:40,120 --> 00:13:41,260
He's Victor.

241
00:13:41,320 --> 00:13:42,830
Look at Victor.

242
00:13:43,620 --> 00:13:45,570
-Show him this one, too.
-Who's this?

243
00:13:45,990 --> 00:13:47,800
-It's Victor--
-Wait.

244
00:13:48,460 --> 00:13:50,260
Kawahara should take a look first.

245
00:13:54,460 --> 00:13:55,470
How is it?

246
00:14:00,090 --> 00:14:01,060
Here.

247
00:14:11,450 --> 00:14:12,500
Who was it?

248
00:14:13,020 --> 00:14:14,500
-Who was it?
-I didn't laugh.

249
00:14:15,090 --> 00:14:16,600
I did not laugh.

250
00:14:22,020 --> 00:14:23,200
Hold on.

251
00:14:28,430 --> 00:14:29,460
Kawahara.

252
00:14:29,520 --> 00:14:30,700
Kawahara?

253
00:14:31,390 --> 00:14:32,500
You smiled, right?

254
00:14:33,390 --> 00:14:37,200
You smiled just like you normally would
when looking at a graduation photo.

255
00:14:38,590 --> 00:14:40,260
Kawahara should take a look first.

256
00:14:44,590 --> 00:14:45,670
How is it?

257
00:14:49,650 --> 00:14:50,860
You smiled.

258
00:14:51,250 --> 00:14:52,600
I was close, too.

259
00:14:52,790 --> 00:14:55,270
If I'd seen one more,
I would have been gone.

260
00:14:55,520 --> 00:14:59,860
He asked you to look at his photos,
but Fujimoto went to smoke in the kitchen.

261
00:14:59,920 --> 00:15:02,670
-I don't think that was right.
-I agree.

262
00:15:02,720 --> 00:15:04,400
-You tried to escape.
-Sorry.

263
00:15:04,490 --> 00:15:06,240
-You have to look properly.
-Right.

264
00:15:06,460 --> 00:15:08,890
But these photos are too much.

265
00:15:09,130 --> 00:15:10,700
-They're too much.
-Hold on.

266
00:15:10,790 --> 00:15:12,830
Well, they were quite a trap.

267
00:15:12,890 --> 00:15:14,700
Trap? Take a look at this!

268
00:15:15,660 --> 00:15:19,500
I don't think it's nice to call someone's
childhood photo a trap, by the way.

269
00:15:22,990 --> 00:15:25,840
-Show him the other photo.
-It's there.

270
00:15:26,460 --> 00:15:28,360
-Show it again.
-I'm scared.

271
00:15:33,260 --> 00:15:34,570
Please take a look.

272
00:15:35,120 --> 00:15:36,300
I will, but...

273
00:15:36,390 --> 00:15:37,840
Don't bring it to me.

274
00:15:38,060 --> 00:15:39,330
Why are you like that?

275
00:15:39,550 --> 00:15:41,500
Look at his father for him.

276
00:15:41,690 --> 00:15:43,500
Don't make it sound like he's dead.

277
00:15:43,560 --> 00:15:44,570
He is dead.

278
00:15:44,620 --> 00:15:45,800
Sorry.

279
00:15:46,060 --> 00:15:47,540
He died when I was two.

280
00:15:48,030 --> 00:15:49,660
What is Victor's...

281
00:15:51,620 --> 00:15:53,230
What's his full name?

282
00:15:53,520 --> 00:15:55,630
I don't know. All I know is "Victor."

283
00:15:58,160 --> 00:15:59,200
Sorry, I don't know.

284
00:16:00,150 --> 00:16:01,630
Please, take a look.

285
00:16:01,920 --> 00:16:04,200
You've had your eyes closed
the whole time.

286
00:16:04,490 --> 00:16:05,940
What was his job?

287
00:16:06,030 --> 00:16:07,170
Professional boxer.

288
00:16:10,950 --> 00:16:14,170
-How many matches did he win?
-He was ranked fourth in the world.

289
00:16:17,030 --> 00:16:18,530
He's damn strong.

290
00:16:23,120 --> 00:16:24,770
How did he pass away?

291
00:16:25,160 --> 00:16:26,400
Cut it out.

292
00:16:27,090 --> 00:16:28,790
-But...
-Stop asking questions.

293
00:16:28,890 --> 00:16:31,830
-I'm curious.
-You're just feeding my imagination.

294
00:16:33,760 --> 00:16:36,000
Please. I won't ask anything else.

295
00:16:36,260 --> 00:16:37,870
It was gout.

296
00:16:45,730 --> 00:16:48,830
-Boxers shouldn't get gout.
-He got it after he quit boxing.

297
00:16:48,890 --> 00:16:50,500
He ate a lot on the rebound.

298
00:16:51,050 --> 00:16:52,400
You two, take a look.

299
00:16:52,590 --> 00:16:53,900
Why do I have to go first?

300
00:16:55,060 --> 00:16:57,040
-Didn't Kawahara see it?
-I did. That's why--

301
00:16:57,090 --> 00:16:58,930
-No, you didn't.
-That's why I got a card.

302
00:16:58,990 --> 00:17:00,700
-Don't lie.
-He got a card for it.

303
00:17:00,750 --> 00:17:02,500
-I got a card for it.
-That's right.

304
00:17:02,660 --> 00:17:06,070
-Let's decide who'll see it first.
-By playing rock-paper-scissors.

305
00:17:06,160 --> 00:17:07,170
Okay.

306
00:17:07,890 --> 00:17:09,130
Rock, paper, scissors.

307
00:17:10,350 --> 00:17:11,360
No way.

308
00:17:15,760 --> 00:17:17,870
He's so dark, you can't even see him.

309
00:17:17,960 --> 00:17:19,630
He's dissolved into the background.

310
00:17:24,690 --> 00:17:25,600
He laughed.

311
00:17:26,830 --> 00:17:27,900
That was you, right?

312
00:17:27,990 --> 00:17:29,030
It wasn't me.

313
00:17:29,100 --> 00:17:30,100
It wasn't me!

314
00:17:30,820 --> 00:17:31,900
That wasn't me!

315
00:17:32,120 --> 00:17:33,330
I held it back.

316
00:17:33,560 --> 00:17:35,100
-It was in your voice.
-It's not me!

317
00:17:35,220 --> 00:17:37,600
-That was Fujimoto.
-No, it was Kubota.

318
00:17:37,660 --> 00:17:39,360
No, I laughed after the red light.

319
00:17:45,760 --> 00:17:47,300
-Kubota.
-Me?

320
00:17:47,460 --> 00:17:48,930
-You laughed.
-You did.

321
00:17:49,150 --> 00:17:50,560
-Your voice was...
-Exactly!

322
00:17:50,620 --> 00:17:52,530
-It was trembling.
-You were trembling!

323
00:17:53,890 --> 00:17:55,270
-You laughed.
-You trembled.

324
00:17:55,320 --> 00:17:57,070
Your voice was trembling.

325
00:17:57,260 --> 00:17:59,200
-It was me?
-That voice was funny.

326
00:17:59,320 --> 00:18:01,100
I told you I'd be more strict.

327
00:18:01,290 --> 00:18:03,130
But that battle was fierce.

328
00:18:03,290 --> 00:18:05,840
I think you're all amazing
for not laughing at gout.

329
00:18:06,630 --> 00:18:08,260
I definitely would've laughed.

330
00:18:08,430 --> 00:18:10,130
I was biting my tongue.

331
00:18:11,020 --> 00:18:14,830
There's only about one hour left,
so I'm going to be even more strict.

332
00:18:15,320 --> 00:18:16,240
Let's go.

333
00:18:16,530 --> 00:18:18,760
-Did Fujimoto see the photos?
-Not yet.

334
00:18:18,830 --> 00:18:21,030
-Enough already.
-He hasn't seen two of them.

335
00:18:21,750 --> 00:18:24,030
-I saw them.
-Two photos is a serious offense.

336
00:18:24,220 --> 00:18:25,740
Kawahara has one to go, too.

337
00:18:25,890 --> 00:18:27,670
I'll laugh even if it's not funny.

338
00:18:28,160 --> 00:18:31,160
-Kawahara hasn't seen it.
-That's right. Don't lie now.

339
00:18:31,820 --> 00:18:33,830
-I saw it.
-I want everyone to see.

340
00:18:33,890 --> 00:18:35,330
-Did you really see it?
-Yes.

341
00:18:38,930 --> 00:18:40,230
You're not looking at it.

342
00:18:42,990 --> 00:18:45,430
You can't separate him
from the background.

343
00:18:47,190 --> 00:18:48,930
You're laughing, Fujimoto.

344
00:18:51,790 --> 00:18:53,730
He must have been healthy back then.

345
00:18:54,020 --> 00:18:56,300
He's so sly. He's setting them up.

346
00:18:56,530 --> 00:18:58,530
He was still a boxer in that photo, right?

347
00:18:58,960 --> 00:19:02,230
No, he'd already retired by the time
I was born.

348
00:19:03,320 --> 00:19:05,130
So he was still boxing, right?

349
00:19:05,460 --> 00:19:07,700
No, he was retired by the time I was born.

350
00:19:08,490 --> 00:19:09,560
Sorry for that.

351
00:19:09,620 --> 00:19:12,670
You're so sneaky,
bringing those photos out at the end.

352
00:19:14,090 --> 00:19:15,330
This is my family now.

353
00:19:15,760 --> 00:19:18,100
Me, my younger brother...

354
00:19:18,530 --> 00:19:20,000
Terumi and Masumi.

355
00:19:22,320 --> 00:19:24,030
Did he have to wear a white shirt?

356
00:19:25,860 --> 00:19:27,400
Enough with the photos!

357
00:19:27,490 --> 00:19:31,030
I told you I'm not going to laugh
at your childhood photos.

358
00:19:31,190 --> 00:19:33,330
This is me during a physical.

359
00:19:34,060 --> 00:19:35,100
My nickname was "Rapist."

360
00:19:35,930 --> 00:19:38,760
-Why such a nickname?
-I don't know. It was given to me.

361
00:19:38,830 --> 00:19:41,030
It's because you look like a rapist.
You're scary.

362
00:19:41,090 --> 00:19:44,300
Why are you first in line
when you're the biggest?

363
00:19:44,420 --> 00:19:48,000
The biggest should be in the back.
How tall was the kid behind you?

364
00:19:48,190 --> 00:19:51,700
Probably about 1.2 meters.
I was already 1.76 meters tall at age 10.

365
00:19:51,890 --> 00:19:53,800
That's scary.
You should've played sports.

366
00:19:53,920 --> 00:19:55,270
-I did.
-What sport?

367
00:19:55,320 --> 00:19:56,340
Dodgebee.

368
00:19:56,390 --> 00:19:58,390
What the hell is that? Not dodgeball?

369
00:19:59,020 --> 00:20:00,700
It's dodgeball using a Frisbee.

370
00:20:00,790 --> 00:20:02,900
Play a more popular sport!
You have the face for it.

371
00:20:05,360 --> 00:20:06,440
What the hell is dodgebee?

372
00:20:06,590 --> 00:20:09,400
-Dodgebee is a safe sport.
-How do you lose in dodgebee?

373
00:20:09,450 --> 00:20:11,760
-When you get hit.
-When what hits you?

374
00:20:11,820 --> 00:20:14,270
You use a Frisbee instead of a ball
in dodgebee.

375
00:20:15,790 --> 00:20:18,060
Dodgebee is... A moth landed on my arm!

376
00:20:19,150 --> 00:20:21,360
What the hell?
Is it a sign to stop talking?

377
00:20:22,120 --> 00:20:23,730
Is it a sign to stop talking?

378
00:20:25,390 --> 00:20:26,640
It stinks!

379
00:20:26,990 --> 00:20:28,530
It came because you stink.

380
00:20:29,120 --> 00:20:31,060
It looks like I have a tattoo.

381
00:20:31,490 --> 00:20:34,130
-It's because you stink.
-Then it should be in my armpit.

382
00:20:34,220 --> 00:20:35,970
It came because your armpit stinks.

383
00:20:36,390 --> 00:20:38,130
If so, it wouldn't stop here.

384
00:20:38,390 --> 00:20:40,060
Your whole life is like a moth.

385
00:20:40,250 --> 00:20:41,800
Who are you calling a moth?

386
00:20:42,090 --> 00:20:44,330
Are you talking to me, or the moth?

387
00:20:46,530 --> 00:20:47,700
Which one?

388
00:20:48,950 --> 00:20:50,100
Your armpit.

389
00:20:50,620 --> 00:20:51,560
My armpit?

390
00:20:51,690 --> 00:20:53,270
You're an armpit moth.

391
00:20:53,490 --> 00:20:55,170
What is an armpit moth?

392
00:20:55,290 --> 00:20:56,440
So I'm an insect?

393
00:20:56,830 --> 00:20:58,000
You are like an insect.

394
00:20:58,090 --> 00:21:00,560
Then spray me with pesticide.
I won't die. Probably.

395
00:21:00,790 --> 00:21:02,060
Try spraying me.

396
00:21:05,960 --> 00:21:07,170
What is this?

397
00:21:08,460 --> 00:21:09,460
Wow.

398
00:21:09,550 --> 00:21:11,300
Why is it still on me?

399
00:21:15,060 --> 00:21:16,500
-Still there?
-It won't--

400
00:21:17,930 --> 00:21:18,760
Damn it!

401
00:21:19,720 --> 00:21:22,060
Now the moth's sitting on my pants.

402
00:21:23,320 --> 00:21:24,830
You're overcooking the pasta.

403
00:21:25,020 --> 00:21:25,900
Look!

404
00:21:26,660 --> 00:21:28,100
It looks like a logo.

405
00:21:29,350 --> 00:21:30,660
Looks fine to me.

406
00:21:31,620 --> 00:21:32,930
There's less than an hour left.

407
00:21:33,290 --> 00:21:35,100
-What should we do?
-Any ideas?

408
00:21:35,490 --> 00:21:37,640
-We have to fight.
-Yeah, let's fight.

409
00:21:37,960 --> 00:21:39,030
Don't you agree?

410
00:21:39,220 --> 00:21:40,700
Yeah...

411
00:21:42,120 --> 00:21:43,100
Yeah

412
00:21:43,260 --> 00:21:44,830
Tears flow endlessly

413
00:21:45,290 --> 00:21:46,500
Yeah, oh, yeah

414
00:21:46,830 --> 00:21:48,530
Yeah, yeah. Tears flow endlessly

415
00:21:48,590 --> 00:21:50,160
You're good at rapping, right?

416
00:21:50,320 --> 00:21:52,630
He is. He's really good at rapping.

417
00:21:52,890 --> 00:21:55,770
-Why don't you two do it together?
-But I can't rap.

418
00:21:55,990 --> 00:21:57,040
You do it.

419
00:21:57,090 --> 00:22:00,160
-You look like you can.
-I can't! That's just my looks.

420
00:22:00,950 --> 00:22:03,230
Don't judge a book by its cover.
I can't rap!

421
00:22:03,790 --> 00:22:05,330
-I can't rap.
-You try, Fujimoto.

422
00:22:05,390 --> 00:22:07,540
-I can't rap.
-You haven't done anything!

423
00:22:08,160 --> 00:22:11,000
-What's going on?
-You give orders, but do nothing yourself.

424
00:22:11,420 --> 00:22:14,000
-So far, he hasn't done anything.
-Neither have you.

425
00:22:15,860 --> 00:22:17,740
-Do something.
-I did that knife joke.

426
00:22:17,790 --> 00:22:19,160
That's the only thing.

427
00:22:22,250 --> 00:22:23,670
You haven't done the knife.

428
00:22:24,120 --> 00:22:26,140
Does everyone have to do it?

429
00:22:26,190 --> 00:22:29,130
You don't have to,
but you haven't done anything.

430
00:22:30,350 --> 00:22:32,700
I can do it, but it won't be funny.

431
00:22:38,460 --> 00:22:39,660
It's not funny at all.

432
00:22:43,120 --> 00:22:44,130
Not funny at all.

433
00:22:46,030 --> 00:22:48,930
-Because you're not wearing the uniform.
-That's not the problem.

434
00:22:49,020 --> 00:22:50,430
This prop isn't funny.

435
00:22:50,490 --> 00:22:52,130
This just doesn't work.

436
00:22:52,620 --> 00:22:54,300
-You forgot about the pasta.
-It's yours!

437
00:22:54,590 --> 00:22:55,600
Oh, yeah.

438
00:22:57,030 --> 00:22:58,590
I'm confused, too.

439
00:22:59,050 --> 00:23:01,160
If you're going to eat, cook it properly.

440
00:23:01,290 --> 00:23:03,330
Why did you boil it? Don't waste it.

441
00:23:03,390 --> 00:23:04,500
This is such a waste.

442
00:23:05,730 --> 00:23:07,140
How firm do you want the pasta?

443
00:23:07,190 --> 00:23:09,160
But you've had it going for so long...

444
00:23:10,120 --> 00:23:11,600
I'll check the firmness.

445
00:23:12,460 --> 00:23:15,000
It's definitely too soft. Isn't that hot?

446
00:23:20,750 --> 00:23:22,030
What are you doing?

447
00:23:30,450 --> 00:23:33,800
Aren't there any ingredients?
You should add something to it.

448
00:23:34,020 --> 00:23:35,230
You don't have to...

449
00:23:36,860 --> 00:23:38,160
You don't have to eat it.

450
00:23:38,360 --> 00:23:39,730
I'm checking the firmness!

451
00:23:42,920 --> 00:23:44,400
You only need to try one.

452
00:23:45,830 --> 00:23:46,740
Just one.

453
00:23:48,430 --> 00:23:49,360
Hey.

454
00:23:49,750 --> 00:23:51,060
He's gone crazy.

455
00:23:51,350 --> 00:23:52,570
You're going crazy.

456
00:23:52,760 --> 00:23:55,840
-Stop him, Anthony.
-Why me? I don't want to. He's crazy.

457
00:23:55,890 --> 00:23:58,260
Don't say that. He's your senior.

458
00:23:58,330 --> 00:24:01,630
Why do you make me do everything?

459
00:24:01,690 --> 00:24:03,200
Because you're the youngest.

460
00:24:03,390 --> 00:24:04,700
That doesn't matter.

461
00:24:04,760 --> 00:24:07,900
Kawahara, stop it. What are you doing?
I can't watch this anymore.

462
00:24:08,430 --> 00:24:09,530
Kawahara.

463
00:24:10,850 --> 00:24:12,130
He's having a real feast.

464
00:24:12,420 --> 00:24:13,630
Stop him.

465
00:24:13,920 --> 00:24:15,000
Kawahara.

466
00:24:15,560 --> 00:24:16,600
Kawahara.

467
00:24:16,960 --> 00:24:18,530
Thirty minutes to go.

468
00:24:19,250 --> 00:24:20,800
Not much time left.

469
00:24:25,590 --> 00:24:26,570
What's up?

470
00:24:26,730 --> 00:24:27,900
What's he doing?

471
00:25:15,690 --> 00:25:16,770
That's promising.

472
00:25:17,390 --> 00:25:18,560
Go for it.

473
00:25:22,960 --> 00:25:23,870
Keep going.

474
00:25:45,520 --> 00:25:46,870
Where's he going with this?

475
00:25:50,090 --> 00:25:51,230
You hit me.

476
00:25:52,120 --> 00:25:53,400
You actually hit me.

477
00:26:36,960 --> 00:26:38,260
Wait a minute.

478
00:26:38,880 --> 00:26:40,960
That was not fair.

479
00:26:41,090 --> 00:26:42,160
What happened?

480
00:26:42,420 --> 00:26:43,530
No way.

481
00:26:45,620 --> 00:26:46,970
No way!

482
00:26:47,690 --> 00:26:48,990
Fujimoto, red card.

483
00:26:51,250 --> 00:26:52,330
You laughed.

484
00:26:57,930 --> 00:27:00,360
-He got me.
-You stole his idea, then laughed at it.

485
00:27:01,350 --> 00:27:02,370
You're out.

486
00:27:02,560 --> 00:27:04,000
We don't have much time.

487
00:27:04,290 --> 00:27:06,400
When you get punched that much,

488
00:27:06,490 --> 00:27:08,360
you can't help but laugh.

489
00:27:08,880 --> 00:27:10,730
I thought, "What the hell am I doing?"

490
00:27:11,050 --> 00:27:13,930
So, Kawahara's plan succeeded.

491
00:27:14,360 --> 00:27:19,760
I realized nobody had
any more cards to play.

492
00:27:20,550 --> 00:27:22,800
We were all feeling each other out,

493
00:27:22,860 --> 00:27:24,900
wondering who would do what.

494
00:27:25,520 --> 00:27:27,000
How frustrating.

495
00:27:27,790 --> 00:27:29,430
Will we get a winner?

496
00:27:34,260 --> 00:27:36,040
It would be nice if we do.

497
00:27:37,130 --> 00:27:38,260
Yeah...

498
00:27:38,790 --> 00:27:40,300
It is an experiment.

499
00:27:46,260 --> 00:27:47,630
-We're on.
-We are.

500
00:27:57,030 --> 00:27:58,030
Good work.

501
00:27:58,920 --> 00:27:59,960
Nice, Kawahara.

502
00:28:02,760 --> 00:28:04,770
It might be best to keep pushing that.

503
00:28:06,060 --> 00:28:07,860
That may be the best strategy.

504
00:28:08,520 --> 00:28:09,600
And where's Anthony?

505
00:28:31,090 --> 00:28:32,800
The drum-drum man

506
00:28:34,520 --> 00:28:36,200
The drum-drum man...

507
00:28:40,250 --> 00:28:41,100
Go for it.

508
00:28:41,620 --> 00:28:42,570
Go, go!

509
00:28:42,620 --> 00:28:44,200
It's a fighting game.

510
00:28:46,860 --> 00:28:48,130
A fighting game.

511
00:28:59,450 --> 00:29:00,960
Anybody laugh?

512
00:29:01,120 --> 00:29:02,230
Ouch!

513
00:29:03,090 --> 00:29:05,200
Nobody's laughing? No laughs?

514
00:29:05,860 --> 00:29:07,600
That one hurt.

515
00:29:10,450 --> 00:29:12,130
Kubota's on the move. Okay!

516
00:29:12,560 --> 00:29:13,730
Kubota's making a move.

517
00:29:13,790 --> 00:29:16,440
There are still 16 minutes left.
That's enough time.

518
00:29:20,720 --> 00:29:22,130
Okay.

519
00:29:22,190 --> 00:29:23,830
He's filling it up with pasta.

520
00:29:24,760 --> 00:29:26,970
He's putting the noodles in like a pro.

521
00:29:27,560 --> 00:29:30,300
So, what's Kubota going to do?

522
00:29:31,590 --> 00:29:33,000
What will he do now?

523
00:29:51,720 --> 00:29:53,000
I admit defeat!

524
00:30:06,130 --> 00:30:07,270
Keep at it.

525
00:30:26,330 --> 00:30:28,030
Poop.

526
00:30:28,090 --> 00:30:29,130
Poo...

527
00:30:29,220 --> 00:30:31,400
Poo...

528
00:30:31,490 --> 00:30:32,530
Poo...

529
00:30:32,660 --> 00:30:33,700
Poo...

530
00:30:33,790 --> 00:30:34,970
Poo...

531
00:30:36,060 --> 00:30:37,300
Poo...

532
00:30:37,460 --> 00:30:38,590
Poo...

533
00:30:41,890 --> 00:30:44,500
I just broke all the toes
on my right foot.

534
00:30:48,850 --> 00:30:49,700
I'm sleepy!

535
00:30:49,890 --> 00:30:51,200
Why do your usual routine?

536
00:30:52,320 --> 00:30:54,300
Who would do a normal set here?

537
00:30:57,590 --> 00:30:58,760
What are you doing?

538
00:30:58,820 --> 00:31:00,460
Could you tie this for me?

539
00:31:00,690 --> 00:31:02,470
-Kawahara, tie it for him.
-Please.

540
00:31:08,350 --> 00:31:09,800
That's too tight!

541
00:31:10,690 --> 00:31:12,530
If I twist it, my dick will show.

542
00:31:16,260 --> 00:31:17,400
Now I have two.

543
00:31:51,850 --> 00:31:53,870
Oh, my. Which is the real one?

544
00:31:54,690 --> 00:31:56,140
Which is the real one?

545
00:32:00,790 --> 00:32:02,500
You? Oh, this is the real one.

546
00:32:05,160 --> 00:32:06,400
I'm the real one.

547
00:32:06,460 --> 00:32:07,560
-You are?
-Yes.

548
00:32:07,830 --> 00:32:09,700
-I'm the real one.
-Which is it?

549
00:32:09,890 --> 00:32:10,960
It's me.

550
00:32:11,120 --> 00:32:12,600
-Which one?
-I'm the real one.

551
00:32:12,790 --> 00:32:14,100
I'm the...

552
00:32:17,530 --> 00:32:19,200
-I'm sleepy.
-I'm sleepy!

553
00:32:19,320 --> 00:32:20,600
I'm sleepy.

554
00:32:23,620 --> 00:32:24,930
Okay.

555
00:32:26,030 --> 00:32:27,560
This is my last resort.

556
00:32:30,050 --> 00:32:31,230
What is it?

557
00:32:32,090 --> 00:32:34,070
-Sorry.
-What is it?

558
00:32:35,260 --> 00:32:36,440
Forgive me.

559
00:32:37,030 --> 00:32:40,230
This is going to be my final act.

560
00:32:41,890 --> 00:32:43,030
Sorry.

561
00:32:43,320 --> 00:32:44,530
Please forgive me.

562
00:32:45,760 --> 00:32:46,800
Forgive me.

563
00:32:47,860 --> 00:32:49,560
Mom and Dad, please forgive me.

564
00:32:49,650 --> 00:32:50,560
Don't do it!

565
00:32:50,650 --> 00:32:52,570
For 10 million yen,

566
00:32:52,660 --> 00:32:54,170
I'm going to...

567
00:32:54,220 --> 00:32:55,630
die.

568
00:33:03,320 --> 00:33:05,370
If you have any questions, ask me now.

569
00:33:06,490 --> 00:33:08,090
What? How... Will you die?

570
00:33:08,320 --> 00:33:09,300
No!

571
00:33:09,350 --> 00:33:10,860
I'm going to poop standing up!

572
00:33:12,420 --> 00:33:13,570
Seriously?

573
00:33:15,220 --> 00:33:17,040
-This is not good.
-Don't do it.

574
00:33:17,090 --> 00:33:19,030
-No way!
-Poop is not the answer.

575
00:33:19,090 --> 00:33:20,130
Poop is wrong.

576
00:33:20,190 --> 00:33:21,260
It's not funny.

577
00:33:21,650 --> 00:33:24,000
-Seriously?
-Poop is not funny.

578
00:33:24,220 --> 00:33:27,070
I always laughed at poop.
That's why I became a comedian!

579
00:33:27,490 --> 00:33:29,160
Don't poop. Do a gag.

580
00:33:30,990 --> 00:33:32,000
A joke will do.

581
00:33:32,050 --> 00:33:33,700
Okay, I'll write it with poop!

582
00:33:33,790 --> 00:33:35,600
I'll write "Amazon" here with poop!

583
00:33:35,830 --> 00:33:36,570
Not funny.

584
00:33:40,590 --> 00:33:42,030
Damn, I'm only getting farts.

585
00:33:42,720 --> 00:33:44,600
-Only farts.
-I won't laugh at poop!

586
00:33:44,660 --> 00:33:46,370
But think about it.

587
00:33:46,530 --> 00:33:49,330
You became a comedian to have fun
and get rich, right?

588
00:33:49,390 --> 00:33:51,100
One poop can earn you 10 million yen!

589
00:33:51,390 --> 00:33:52,570
But I won't laugh.

590
00:33:53,460 --> 00:33:55,500
Poop is not going to make me laugh!

591
00:33:56,660 --> 00:33:57,790
No pooping!

592
00:33:58,550 --> 00:33:59,860
Wear a mask!

593
00:34:00,320 --> 00:34:01,630
I've had enough of masks!

594
00:34:02,560 --> 00:34:03,870
They're better than poop!

595
00:34:06,830 --> 00:34:07,930
Seven minutes left.

596
00:34:15,590 --> 00:34:16,900
We just have to fight.

597
00:34:17,690 --> 00:34:19,830
Let's do something. Shall we use props?

598
00:34:21,490 --> 00:34:22,500
Prop jokes?

599
00:34:23,960 --> 00:34:25,330
Should we do that?

600
00:34:30,950 --> 00:34:32,030
Good morning, sir!

601
00:34:32,390 --> 00:34:33,370
Who are you?

602
00:34:33,560 --> 00:34:34,530
I'm Kakefu.

603
00:34:35,160 --> 00:34:36,270
You grew.

604
00:34:36,730 --> 00:34:37,830
You're bigger now.

605
00:34:37,990 --> 00:34:39,330
Kakefu wears pants.

606
00:34:39,920 --> 00:34:42,530
I'm Mr. Tigers, Masayuki Kakefu!

607
00:34:42,720 --> 00:34:44,330
But your crotch is a Panther.

608
00:34:47,360 --> 00:34:48,290
Huh?

609
00:34:49,750 --> 00:34:52,500
Your top says you're a Tiger.
What do your pants say?

610
00:34:53,760 --> 00:34:54,730
I'm a Panther.

611
00:34:56,630 --> 00:34:57,530
No way.

612
00:35:00,750 --> 00:35:01,830
This is not good.

613
00:35:02,020 --> 00:35:03,170
Not good at all.

614
00:35:03,260 --> 00:35:04,300
Go for it!

615
00:35:06,690 --> 00:35:07,930
We have to find a winner.

616
00:35:08,480 --> 00:35:09,660
We're out of props.

617
00:35:10,350 --> 00:35:12,260
Should we all do something together?

618
00:35:12,490 --> 00:35:14,370
-Let's give it a try.
-Yeah.

619
00:35:14,420 --> 00:35:15,570
Otherwise...

620
00:35:15,790 --> 00:35:17,460
No point thinking.

621
00:35:18,350 --> 00:35:19,530
What should we do?

622
00:35:22,460 --> 00:35:25,070
What if we all go home with nothing?

623
00:35:25,520 --> 00:35:26,900
We have to do something.

624
00:35:32,190 --> 00:35:34,400
Should we try an impression?

625
00:35:35,790 --> 00:35:38,730
Let's all imitate the same person
and see who's best, okay?

626
00:35:40,690 --> 00:35:42,000
Who should it be?

627
00:35:43,060 --> 00:35:45,030
-Takuya Kimura?
-How about Croket?

628
00:35:45,090 --> 00:35:47,790
-The king of impressions?
-I don't know about Croket.

629
00:35:47,860 --> 00:35:50,330
Croket is the one who does
the impressions.

630
00:35:50,850 --> 00:35:52,900
-I think Kimura's okay.
-Okay.

631
00:35:52,990 --> 00:35:54,700
-Who goes first?
-Kawahara.

632
00:35:55,560 --> 00:35:56,870
-Me first?
-Yes.

633
00:35:57,490 --> 00:36:00,160
So, is this is a serious impression?

634
00:36:00,450 --> 00:36:01,700
Of course.

635
00:36:02,890 --> 00:36:04,170
"Wait up!"

636
00:36:05,960 --> 00:36:07,000
"Hey."

637
00:36:07,930 --> 00:36:09,360
"Wait up, Croket."

638
00:36:13,520 --> 00:36:16,470
What kind of scene is that?
Is Kimura chasing Croket?

639
00:36:19,290 --> 00:36:20,330
Anthony.

640
00:36:21,490 --> 00:36:23,500
"Wait up!"

641
00:36:25,690 --> 00:36:27,530
"Wait up!"

642
00:36:27,630 --> 00:36:29,100
Why does he have an accent?

643
00:36:30,750 --> 00:36:31,830
Why the accent?

644
00:36:31,990 --> 00:36:33,230
Your turn, Kubota.

645
00:36:38,480 --> 00:36:39,600
"Wait up!"

646
00:36:44,260 --> 00:36:46,800
You act like you're the best,
but you're hopeless.

647
00:36:51,450 --> 00:36:53,530
Six hours and still no winner.

648
00:36:55,790 --> 00:36:57,030
Ten seconds...

649
00:36:57,790 --> 00:37:00,330
Eight, seven, six...

650
00:37:00,450 --> 00:37:03,170
five, four, three...

651
00:37:05,090 --> 00:37:07,690
TIME UP
(SIX HOURS HAVE PASSED)

652
00:37:07,830 --> 00:37:09,360
It's over...

653
00:37:09,690 --> 00:37:11,700
This sure is difficult.

654
00:37:11,850 --> 00:37:13,000
It's really hard.

655
00:37:24,020 --> 00:37:25,200
Good job.

656
00:37:25,360 --> 00:37:26,700
-Thank you.
-Thank you.

657
00:37:29,320 --> 00:37:31,100
I think we've all had enough.

658
00:37:36,360 --> 00:37:38,060
Should we talk in the other room?

659
00:37:39,090 --> 00:37:40,200
-Okay.
-Okay.

660
00:37:44,590 --> 00:37:47,200
The other room?
Oh, because we can't laugh in here.

661
00:37:47,860 --> 00:37:49,430
Are we allowed to laugh now?

662
00:37:50,320 --> 00:37:51,600
I guess it's fine now.

663
00:37:54,590 --> 00:37:55,770
Whoa!

664
00:37:55,860 --> 00:37:57,460
-This is amazing!
-Incredible!

665
00:37:58,090 --> 00:38:01,100
-What is this place?
-I've seen this at a casino.

666
00:38:01,720 --> 00:38:02,930
What is this place?

667
00:38:03,260 --> 00:38:04,900
Six hours, but no winner.

668
00:38:04,960 --> 00:38:07,990
IF A SOLO WINNER IS NOT DETERMINED,
NO ONE GETS 10 MILLION YEN

669
00:38:08,050 --> 00:38:10,200
I guess there's always next time.

670
00:38:11,520 --> 00:38:13,830
-How frustrating.
-That was...

671
00:38:13,990 --> 00:38:17,960
-There should be a way to win.
-What were we lacking?

672
00:38:18,480 --> 00:38:21,560
It just shows how hard it is
to narrow it down to one.

673
00:38:23,290 --> 00:38:26,570
The fact we couldn't narrow it down
is part of the documentary, too.

674
00:38:26,990 --> 00:38:28,830
If it was me, at that stage,

675
00:38:28,920 --> 00:38:30,000
I would've pooped.

676
00:38:30,120 --> 00:38:32,770
I punched my guts so many times,
but nothing came out.

677
00:38:33,960 --> 00:38:37,390
I tried, but all I could do was fart.
And even then, they were silent.

678
00:38:37,760 --> 00:38:40,260
But if you had pooped,
you would've got a red card.

679
00:38:50,390 --> 00:38:53,770
If only they'd given us one more minute,
I would've won.

680
00:39:00,550 --> 00:39:02,000
Thank you.

681
00:39:04,090 --> 00:39:05,030
Thank you.

682
00:39:05,290 --> 00:39:06,440
Is this the way?

683
00:39:09,190 --> 00:39:10,830
I really should have pooped.

684
00:39:12,090 --> 00:39:13,500
But it didn't come out.

685
00:39:14,760 --> 00:39:18,030
Sorry for contaminating
your eyes and ears.

686
00:39:18,090 --> 00:39:19,230
Hope to see you again.
