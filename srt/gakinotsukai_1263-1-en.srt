00:00:45,900 --> 00:00:47,760
You seriously can't  say something like that!

23
00:00:48,190 --> 00:00:52,530
Secret Camera

On this day, everyone in the studio was nervous

43
00:01:18,320 --> 00:01:20,700
Good afternoon

44
00:01:20,460 --> 00:01:28,670
We pranked Hamada

45
00:01:20,820 --> 00:01:23,670
That's right, we

46
00:01:23,670 --> 00:01:27,600
dokkiri'd Hamada

47
00:01:28,820 --> 00:01:31,400
Good afternoon

48
00:01:29,030 --> 00:01:36,440
The other 5 who are all involved as well enter the studio

49
00:01:31,520 --> 00:01:36,150
The 5 who are involved in the Dokkiri come into the studio

50
00:01:37,010 --> 00:01:37,310
After this, we reveal all whilst filming

51
00:01:37,310 --> 00:01:46,220
After this, we reveal all whilst filming

52
00:01:38,100 --> 00:01:41,670
After this, we reveal all whilst filming

53
00:01:41,670 --> 00:01:46,170
Allow us to explain what the Dokkiri is about

54
00:01:46,590 --> 00:02:01,530
What the Prank is about

55
00:01:46,650 --> 00:02:01,530
when speaking casually

56
00:01:46,650 --> 00:02:01,530
A rumour has it that Hamada comes up with

57
00:01:46,650 --> 00:02:01,530
great quotes

58
00:01:46,650 --> 00:02:01,530
m 0 0 l 0 15 l 18 15 l 18 0

59
00:01:46,750 --> 00:02:01,530
To find out if this was true

60
00:01:46,790 --> 00:02:01,530
they sent him on a fake filming outing

61
00:01:47,150 --> 00:01:53,870
We heard a rumour that Hamada comes up with great quotes when speaking casually

62
00:01:53,870 --> 00:01:56,900
So in order to find out if that was true...

63
00:01:56,900 --> 00:02:01,720
We sent him on a fake filming outing.

64
00:02:01,870 --> 00:02:07,570
What will Hamada do when he finds out...

65
00:02:01,870 --> 00:02:07,570
What will Hamada do when he finds out...

66
00:02:02,020 --> 00:02:05,270
And Hamada has no idea yet what is happening

67
00:02:05,270 --> 00:02:07,770
How will he react?

68
00:02:07,770 --> 00:02:10,020
We are rolling in 3...2...1...

69
00:02:14,800 --> 00:02:16,320
So um....

70
00:02:14,880 --> 00:02:19,120

Matsumoto Hitoshi

73
00:02:16,320 --> 00:02:18,170
basically...

74
00:02:18,170 --> 00:02:19,320
apparently...

75
00:02:19,320 --> 00:02:21,420
Quotes,

76
00:02:19,320 --> 00:02:21,420
m 0 0 l 0 15 l 18 15 l 18 0

77
00:02:19,320 --> 00:02:21,420
you know

78
00:02:21,420 --> 00:02:24,460
Have you guys come out with like... quotes during your careers?

79
00:02:21,420 --> 00:02:26,060
Quotes

80
00:02:21,420 --> 00:02:26,060
m 0 0 l 0 15 l 18 15 l 18 0

81
00:02:24,460 --> 00:02:26,060
Have you guys come out with like... quotes during your careers?

82
00:02:26,060 --> 00:02:30,870
I think when I said, "A burdock is just a tree and only a tree" is like my quote...

83
00:02:26,260 --> 00:02:28,760
Tsukitei Hosei

84
00:02:31,620 --> 00:02:33,370
It's like something only I can say

85
00:02:31,620 --> 00:02:33,900
Cocorico

86
00:02:31,620 --> 00:02:33,900
Endo Shozo

87
00:02:31,620 --> 00:02:33,900
Tanaka Naoki

88
00:02:33,370 --> 00:02:34,270
That's true

89
00:02:34,270 --> 00:02:38,640
A quote

90
00:02:34,270 --> 00:02:38,640
cannot

91
00:02:34,270 --> 00:02:38,640
m 0 0 l 0 15 l 18 15 l 18 0

92
00:02:34,900 --> 00:02:38,640
just be

93
00:02:34,900 --> 00:02:38,640
created because you want

94
00:02:34,900 --> 00:02:38,640
m 0 0 l 0 15 l 18 15 l 18 0

95
00:02:36,940 --> 00:02:38,640
to create one

96
00:02:38,640 --> 00:02:43,310
I think it's when you're speaking normally and

97
00:02:41,340 --> 00:02:43,310
a quote

98
00:02:41,340 --> 00:02:43,310
comes out is when it is a 'quote'

99
00:02:41,340 --> 00:02:43,310
m 0 0 l 0 15 l 18 15 l 18 0

100
00:02:43,310 --> 00:02:46,550
What I just said

101
00:02:43,310 --> 00:02:46,550
is

102
00:02:43,310 --> 00:02:46,550
m 0 0 l 0 15 l 18 15 l 18 0

103
00:02:43,310 --> 00:02:46,550
now my quote.

104
00:02:48,570 --> 00:02:52,600
I've also heard a rumour recently...

105
00:02:48,650 --> 00:02:51,020
What the hell are you on about?

106
00:02:52,650 --> 00:02:53,320
I see

107
00:02:53,320 --> 00:02:55,320
Hamada-san...

108
00:02:55,350 --> 00:02:57,470
You casually come up with great quotes.

109
00:02:57,470 --> 00:03:00,420
That's what I've heard.

110
00:02:57,470 --> 00:03:08,000
Rumour about Hamada

111
00:02:57,470 --> 00:03:08,000
When casually speaking, comes up with great quotes

112
00:02:57,470 --> 00:03:08,000
m 0 0 l 0 15 l 18 15 l 18 0

113
00:02:58,700 --> 00:03:00,420
Really?

114
00:03:00,550 --> 00:03:02,300
Without trying to?

115
00:03:01,420 --> 00:03:02,270
Yeah.

116
00:03:02,290 --> 00:03:04,950
If that's true, that is really amazing.

117
00:03:04,950 --> 00:03:07,320
What are you talking about?

118
00:03:06,270 --> 00:03:07,320
So, umm...

119
00:03:07,400 --> 00:03:08,000
You know...

120
00:03:08,000 --> 00:03:11,040
You went and did something for us, didn't you?

121
00:03:10,270 --> 00:03:12,250
Huh?

122
00:03:12,250 --> 00:03:13,810
You went there and did a little something for us?

123
00:03:13,810 --> 00:03:14,840
Where?

124
00:03:14,840 --> 00:03:18,640

A Great Quote Journey?

129
00:03:19,520 --> 00:03:21,920
You went on a little great quote trip, right?

130
00:03:22,110 --> 00:03:25,450
What the hell is this

131
00:03:22,550 --> 00:03:25,450

So umm...basically

136
00:03:26,790 --> 00:03:33,390
Note behind camera

137
00:03:26,790 --> 00:03:33,390

00:03:27,220 --> 00:03:28,650

00:03:39,470 --> 00:03:41,570
Don't mess with me!!

147
00:03:41,300 --> 00:03:43,900
You went

148
00:03:42,820 --> 00:03:43,900
Yes yes

149
00:03:43,900 --> 00:03:46,120
to film for the promotion video

150
00:03:43,900 --> 00:03:58,180
Was invited by Nakada Yasutaka to film for
Hamada Bamyu Bamyu's new promotion video

151

m 0 0 l 0 15 l 18 15 l 18 0

152
00:03:46,120 --> 00:03:47,820
of Hamada Bamyu Bamyu, right?

153
00:03:47,820 --> 00:03:48,770
Yeah, to Enoshima.

154
00:03:48,770 --> 00:03:50,900
Right, Enoshima.

155
00:03:50,900 --> 00:03:53,300
But actually, we didn't tell you this...

156
00:03:53,300 --> 00:03:56,800
This is ridiculous, you've got to be kidding me!

157
00:03:56,800 --> 00:03:57,970
A prank!!

158
00:03:57,970 --> 00:04:00,920
No seriously guys, like...

159
00:04:00,920 --> 00:04:04,320
They made me walk so much

160
00:04:02,620 --> 00:04:03,170
Yeah

161
00:04:03,250 --> 00:04:04,550
In Enoshima

162
00:04:04,550 --> 00:04:05,990
I think I said it while filming, but

163
00:04:05,990 --> 00:04:06,960
I totally understand how Yama-chan feels now.

164
00:04:06,960 --> 00:04:08,930
I totally understand how Yama-chan feels now.

165
00:04:08,930 --> 00:04:10,430
I have no trust for the staff here at all anymore.

166
00:04:10,430 --> 00:04:14,030
I have no trust for the staff here at all anymore.

167
00:04:12,470 --> 00:04:14,030
I know, right?!

168
00:04:14,030 --> 00:04:16,970
Yeah, you've lost all trust for them too, right?

169
00:04:17,070 --> 00:04:19,100
I'm sorry that you feel like that,

170
00:04:19,200 --> 00:04:20,220
but let's try to build some trust up again.

171
00:04:20,220 --> 00:04:22,020
So, let's hear your great quotes and...

172
00:04:22,070 --> 00:04:22,970
come up with a single quote

173
00:04:22,070 --> 00:04:24,780
I have not

174
00:04:22,070 --> 00:04:24,780
m 0 0 l 0 15 l 18 15 l 18 0

175
00:04:22,970 --> 00:04:24,780
come up with a single quote!!

176
00:04:23,900 --> 00:04:26,730
They just made me walk around

177
00:04:26,770 --> 00:04:28,520
and that was it.

178
00:04:28,520 --> 00:04:29,870
But it's when you're acting normally...

179
00:04:29,870 --> 00:04:31,980
While you were walking around normally

180
00:04:31,980 --> 00:04:35,790
great quotes

181
00:04:31,980 --> 00:04:35,790
have come out of your mouth.

182
00:04:31,980 --> 00:04:35,790
m 0 0 l 0 15 l 18 15 l 18 0

183
00:04:33,450 --> 00:04:35,790
No seriously, I haven't come up with one.

184
00:04:35,850 --> 00:04:38,970
Well we have a lot to watch.

185
00:04:37,450 --> 00:04:38,970
I want to see it now!

186
00:04:39,400 --> 00:04:40,300
Oh man oh man...

187
00:04:40,300 --> 00:04:41,020
I think there will be a few.

188
00:04:41,020 --> 00:04:45,060
Are you fucking kidding me, OI!

189
00:04:41,020 --> 00:04:45,060
Are you fucking kidding me, OI!

190
00:04:47,570 --> 00:04:52,340
So did Hamada-san naturally come up with some

191
00:04:47,570 --> 00:04:52,340
great quotes

192
00:04:47,570 --> 00:04:52,340
m 0 0 l 0 15 l 18 15 l 18 0

193
00:04:49,400 --> 00:04:52,340
during his trip, let's check it out.

194
00:04:52,460 --> 00:04:53,410
VTR start!

195
00:04:53,500 --> 00:04:56,140
You've got to be kidding me!!

196
00:04:56,810 --> 00:05:01,480
A string of great quotes from Enoshima

197
00:04:56,810 --> 00:05:01,480
After the break

198
00:04:56,900 --> 00:05:01,470
After the break, a string of great quotes from Enoshima!

199
00:05:01,480 --> 00:05:02,580
There are so many elementary school kids on there

200
00:05:02,580 --> 00:05:04,520
There are so many elementary school kids on there

201
00:05:04,820 --> 00:05:06,050
I will

202
00:05:09,720 --> 00:05:10,560
Hamada goes to Enoshima special!

203
00:05:10,560 --> 00:05:14,260
Hamada goes to Enoshima special!

204
00:05:14,430 --> 00:05:17,760
Inamoto Junichi

205
00:05:14,430 --> 00:05:17,760
License

206
00:05:15,520 --> 00:05:17,350
What the hell!

207
00:05:17,470 --> 00:05:18,770
What's wrong?

208
00:05:18,130 --> 00:05:32,480
Invited by Nakada Yasutaka, Hamada has been dragged out for a shoot
for his Hamada Bamyu Bamyu promotion video

209
00:05:18,130 --> 00:05:32,480
m 0 0 l 0 15 l 18 15 l 18 0

210
00:05:18,770 --> 00:05:20,550
Like, seriously...today

211
00:05:20,550 --> 00:05:22,920
I'm going to moan so much like Heipo

212
00:05:22,920 --> 00:05:24,350
Please don't do that.

213
00:05:23,600 --> 00:05:25,960
Inamoto didn't know either, right?

214
00:05:24,350 --> 00:05:26,450
I'll do it in a really polite way as well.

215
00:05:26,100 --> 00:05:27,960
Correct.

216
00:05:26,450 --> 00:05:27,520
Like, really polite and correct Japanese.

217
00:05:27,520 --> 00:05:29,650
"It really is like this, right?"

218
00:05:30,720 --> 00:05:33,950
That's totally Heipo-san.

219
00:05:33,950 --> 00:05:35,750
This is a special episode for Hamada Bamyu Bamyu.

220
00:05:35,750 --> 00:05:37,520
This is a special episode for Hamada Bamyu Bamyu.

221
00:05:37,520 --> 00:05:39,520
I've already said I've had enough.

222
00:05:39,520 --> 00:05:42,320
It doesn't matter how many times you say you've had enough,

223
00:05:42,320 --> 00:05:44,720
you've been invited by Nakada Yasutaka-san.

224
00:05:43,770 --> 00:05:46,220
How much of a big shot is this Nakada guy?

225
00:05:46,300 --> 00:05:48,070
Nakada-san has nothing to do with it really..

226
00:05:46,420 --> 00:05:55,370
m 0 0 l 0 15 l 18 15 l 18 0

227
00:05:46,620 --> 00:05:55,370
A quote to hurt the feelings of a man he's never even met

228
00:05:51,220 --> 00:05:52,920
Someone I've never met...

229
00:05:51,830 --> 00:05:55,370
How much of a big shot is this Nakada guy?

230
00:05:55,370 --> 00:05:56,020
No no no...

231
00:05:57,320 --> 00:05:59,870
I'm saying that I don't want to do it though

232
00:06:00,100 --> 00:06:02,920
But you've got to do your job there properly, right?

233
00:06:03,020 --> 00:06:05,850
Isn't there anyone I can speak to about it?

234
00:06:05,850 --> 00:06:07,850
That would be Heipo-san...

235
00:06:08,380 --> 00:06:14,590
We explain to the moaning Hamada what he's going to be up to on this 'fake trip'

236
00:06:08,380 --> 00:06:14,590
We explain to the moaning Hamada what he's going to be up to on this 'fake trip'

237
00:06:09,020 --> 00:06:14,800
After this, putting up with the moaning Hamada, we explain what he is going to be up to today.

238
00:06:11,120 --> 00:06:13,800
Are you guys kidding me??

239
00:06:14,950 --> 00:06:20,930
We gave him the money he needed for the trip and he was ready...

240
00:06:14,950 --> 00:06:20,930
We gave him the money he needed for the trip and he was ready...

241
00:06:15,500 --> 00:06:20,470
We gave him the money he needed for this journey and he was ready to go.

242
00:06:21,550 --> 00:06:22,160
I don't get why I've got to do this.

243
00:06:22,160 --> 00:06:24,000
Please smile when you're being filmed today, okay?

244
00:06:24,000 --> 00:06:25,250
You just want me to look happy, right?

245
00:06:25,250 --> 00:06:27,300
Yes, please.

246
00:06:25,570 --> 00:06:27,300
I'm going to be like this the whole day.

247
00:06:27,600 --> 00:06:28,520
That's no good...

248
00:06:28,520 --> 00:06:30,520
Please smile.

249
00:06:30,540 --> 00:06:34,470
Off camera, you're

250
00:06:31,270 --> 00:06:34,470
so nice to everyone usually!

251
00:06:33,620 --> 00:06:35,920
You never make that kind of face!

252
00:06:36,610 --> 00:06:41,480
Journey Begins

253
00:06:36,610 --> 00:06:41,480
Journey Begins

254
00:06:37,100 --> 00:06:39,650
He doesn't seem too happy about it,

255
00:06:39,650 --> 00:06:41,650
but his journey begins!

256
00:06:42,650 --> 00:06:44,650
This is horrible.

257
00:06:45,180 --> 00:06:47,790
Since we are going to Enoshima, you're going to ride the Eno train.

258
00:06:45,180 --> 00:06:51,820
Staff

259
00:06:47,790 --> 00:06:51,820
Since we are going to Enoshima, you're going to ride the Eno train.

260
00:06:51,820 --> 00:06:53,530
Wait, we're not going by car?

261

m 0 0 l 0 15 l 18 15 l 18 0

262
00:06:53,890 --> 00:07:01,200
A quote only a super celebrity can come up with:

263
00:06:56,560 --> 00:07:01,200
Wait, we're not going by car?

264
00:06:56,770 --> 00:06:58,420
They're just making a meal of it.

265
00:06:59,920 --> 00:07:01,470
No! No! No!

266
00:07:02,570 --> 00:07:04,170
Man, he's a proper celebrity.

267
00:07:04,370 --> 00:07:06,520
When you go on a trip, you ride the train.

268
00:07:04,570 --> 00:07:10,040
First, he heads to the train station.

269
00:07:04,570 --> 00:07:10,040
First, he heads to the train station.

270
00:07:05,570 --> 00:07:07,100
He really is a star.

271
00:07:06,520 --> 00:07:08,800
He heads for the station.

272
00:07:08,800 --> 00:07:10,800
When...

273
00:07:12,820 --> 00:07:14,270
Oh, hello there.

274
00:07:14,270 --> 00:07:16,270
Oww...

275
00:07:16,760 --> 00:07:18,530
There's no need to film that, man!

m 0 0 l 0 15 l 18 15 l 18 0

277
00:07:18,920 --> 00:07:27,760
A desperate quote to hide the fact that he's an old man:

278
00:07:23,050 --> 00:07:24,620
What the hell is this?

279
00:07:23,590 --> 00:07:27,760
Oww...There's no need to film that man!

280
00:07:27,760 --> 00:07:28,390
Why is he speaking with like no emotion in his voice?

281
00:07:28,390 --> 00:07:31,530
Why is he speaking with like no emotion in his voice?

282
00:07:32,220 --> 00:07:36,650
Won't people think that I'm doing a new program by myself, like about my adventures and stuff?

283
00:07:36,650 --> 00:07:38,870
It looks so crap, man.

284
00:07:38,970 --> 00:07:42,200
I can't be doing this when I'm by myself.

285
00:07:42,640 --> 00:07:50,920
m 0 0 l 0 15 l 18 15 l 18 0

286
00:07:42,940 --> 00:07:50,920
A quote for his beloved partner (Matsumoto):

287
00:07:44,450 --> 00:07:47,900
No no no, what the hell?

288
00:07:46,610 --> 00:07:50,920
I can't be doing this when I'm by myself

289
00:07:50,920 --> 00:07:51,280
That really

290
00:07:51,280 --> 00:07:54,300
Hit me in the feels right now...

291
00:07:52,320 --> 00:07:54,270
Oh piss off!

292
00:07:56,200 --> 00:07:57,900
Hello, there.

293
00:07:58,100 --> 00:08:03,420
Everyone looks like they're having fun even though it's so hot, are they all okay?

294
00:08:03,420 --> 00:08:05,420
Sup!

295
00:08:06,700 --> 00:08:13,910
He waves to the people, starting to look like a journey program

296
00:08:06,700 --> 00:08:13,910
He waves to the people, starting to look like a journey program

297
00:08:07,420 --> 00:08:12,970
He starts to talk to the people around him, making it look like a show about his journey...

298
00:08:09,820 --> 00:08:11,500
This really is truly amazing.

299
00:08:11,500 --> 00:08:13,950
You would be happy if Hamada-san waved to you.

300
00:08:12,970 --> 00:08:14,970
But...

301
00:08:15,450 --> 00:08:17,750
Can we finish now?

302
00:08:16,600 --> 00:08:17,750
No no no...

303
00:08:18,040 --> 00:08:27,220
m 0 0 l 0 15 l 18 15 l 18 0

304
00:08:18,180 --> 00:08:27,220
An awful 'boke' joke...

305
00:08:22,980 --> 00:08:27,220
Can we finish now?

306
00:08:27,220 --> 00:08:30,620
What the hell is this, seriously?

307
00:08:30,620 --> 00:08:32,850
After 5 minutes of walking...

308
00:08:32,850 --> 00:08:36,250
We see Shichirigahama Station

309
00:08:34,550 --> 00:08:37,500
I see, the Eno Train.

310
00:08:35,620 --> 00:08:37,500
Shirichirigahama is meant to be a nice place, right?

311
00:08:37,520 --> 00:08:39,400
I would have helped her if she had waited.

312
00:08:41,630 --> 00:08:46,100
Buying a ticket to Enoshima

313
00:08:41,630 --> 00:08:46,100
Buying a ticket to Enoshima

314
00:08:42,770 --> 00:08:46,910
First off, he must buy a ticket to Enoshima.

315
00:08:47,570 --> 00:08:49,050
Enoshima, right?

316
00:08:52,550 --> 00:08:57,320
It's so easy, it says right here that it costs 220 yen.

317
00:09:01,820 --> 00:09:03,870
You were close to pressing the button next to it there.

318
00:09:03,870 --> 00:09:06,450
No I wasn't...

319
00:09:10,320 --> 00:09:11,600
What you eating there?

320
00:09:11,600 --> 00:09:13,600
Ohh I see, Bara-zushi?

321
00:09:11,600 --> 00:09:15,230
(Note: Bara-zushi is basically Sushi with a variety of ingredients sprinkled on the rice)

323
00:09:15,600 --> 00:09:22,540
A quote only someone so frank could say:

324
00:09:19,330 --> 00:09:21,200
This pisses me off so much!

325
00:09:19,500 --> 00:09:22,540
Bara-zushi?

326
00:09:22,330 --> 00:09:23,960
What the hell!?

327
00:09:22,540 --> 00:09:24,210
Wait, that part?

328
00:09:24,210 --> 00:09:27,410
Not the  'What are you eating there' part?

329
00:09:25,600 --> 00:09:27,220
You're right!

330
00:09:27,410 --> 00:09:28,280
They quote the 'bara-zushi' part?

331
00:09:30,200 --> 00:09:33,250
This happened when we were waiting for the train.

332
00:09:33,250 --> 00:09:37,120
It just casually came out of Hamada's mouth...

333
00:09:38,070 --> 00:09:40,670
Is the lens getting cloudy? If it's getting cloudy, let's just stop recording...

A remark to scare the staff:

336
00:09:45,060 --> 00:09:47,060
I wasn't trying to scare them at all!

337
00:09:45,500 --> 00:09:51,170
If it's getting cloudy, let's just stop recording...

338
00:09:51,440 --> 00:09:55,310
Who the hell is doing the narration here?

339
00:09:53,700 --> 00:09:56,170
While we were doing that...

340
00:09:56,200 --> 00:09:57,100
Here it is.

341
00:09:56,540 --> 00:10:01,780
A train came from the opposite direction

342
00:09:56,540 --> 00:10:01,780
A train came from the opposite direction

343
00:09:57,050 --> 00:10:00,570
A train going the other way came in

344
00:10:03,870 --> 00:10:05,670
There really are quite a lot of people

345
00:10:05,670 --> 00:10:07,670
on the train...

346
00:10:11,650 --> 00:10:14,150
Do we get on this...oh, we don't get on it?

347
00:10:14,150 --> 00:10:16,150
Oh, we're going the other way.

348
00:10:20,950 --> 00:10:22,970
Please hurry up and go...

349
00:10:23,850 --> 00:10:25,420
Please just hurry up and go...

350
00:10:25,330 --> 00:10:27,660
I get how you feel.

351
00:10:26,670 --> 00:10:28,170
you know?

352
00:10:28,200 --> 00:10:30,200
That's terrible of you!

353
00:10:30,370 --> 00:10:32,150
Unbelievable...

354
00:10:32,150 --> 00:10:34,150
They're just taking pictures of me without permission.

355
00:10:35,170 --> 00:10:37,500
On top of that...

356
00:10:37,500 --> 00:10:39,900
Lady, wow, you really are something else...

357
00:10:38,730 --> 00:10:40,360
Oh my god!

Oh just leave it out!

Isn't this like...

367
00:10:58,150 --> 00:11:00,670
If I stopped her, it would become a huge thing...

368
00:11:00,670 --> 00:11:04,070
So isn't it the staff's job to stop her?

This time, a train going to Enoshima arrives.

Oh man, there are loads of elementary school kids on the train...

373
00:11:14,100 --> 00:11:15,530
WOAH!

374
00:11:15,560 --> 00:11:16,860

That is tough!

378
00:11:19,730 --> 00:11:21,860
Yeah, it is.

379
00:11:22,000 --> 00:11:25,860
And because it's tough, we'll get some great quotes out of you.

The atmosphere in the train goes crazy.

385
00:11:33,630 --> 00:11:35,360
That's great.

386
00:11:35,520 --> 00:11:36,720
Seriously...

387
00:11:37,270 --> 00:11:39,070

Please just stop this...

398
00:11:59,570 --> 00:12:02,350
Why are there so many kids, is it a school trip?

399
00:12:02,350 --> 00:12:04,020
School trip?

400
00:12:04,020 --> 00:12:06,020
(Staff) It looks that way...

Oh, a junior high school trip?

This is truly amazing.

403

But Miyane-ya is on Yomiuri TV Channel, though!

431
00:13:07,130 --> 00:13:09,960
That's true, though.

This was so annoying, I really got done over here...

Were you by yourself the whole time?

It's amazing weather.

442

So what, do I need to walk quicker here or anything like that?

443
00:13:31,800 --> 00:13:34,530
No, not at all.

00:15:07,790 --> 00:15:11,160
It'll be even tastier if you make it yourself and eat it.

495
00:15:11,160 --> 00:15:12,720
How the hell has this happened?

496
00:15:13,020 --> 00:15:21,300
m 0 0 l 0 15 l 18 15 l 18 0

497
00:15:13,090 --> 00:15:21,300
Making a huge deal out of something so small:

498
00:15:17,260 --> 00:15:21,170
This is ridiculous, just cut it out you guys!

499
00:15:18,100 --> 00:15:21,300
How the hell has this happened?

500
00:15:21,300 --> 00:15:23,230
That's normal.

501
00:15:23,230 --> 00:15:30,210
How to make it

502
00:15:23,230 --> 00:15:30,210
Just put the spiny lobster on the rice cracker and press it down hard

503
00:15:23,230 --> 00:15:30,210
m 0 0 l 0 15 l 18 15 l 18 0

504
00:15:23,600 --> 00:15:27,660
It's very simple to make. Spread the rice dough...

505
00:15:27,660 --> 00:15:30,560
Place the spiny lobster on it and push down hard.

506
00:15:30,530 --> 00:15:32,660
And close it?

507
00:15:31,000 --> 00:15:32,660
Yes.

508
00:15:32,660 --> 00:15:35,500
And turn this slowly.

509
00:15:38,930 --> 00:15:40,760
Like this?

510
00:15:42,900 --> 00:15:44,930
Oh wow, it's making a hell of a sound now!

511
00:15:45,400 --> 00:15:47,400
Now just quickly push it to the left.

512
00:15:53,660 --> 00:15:55,960
Surely I've cooked it too much?

513
00:15:55,670 --> 00:16:00,200
After waiting 5 minutes

514
00:15:55,670 --> 00:16:00,200
After waiting 5 minutes

515
00:15:56,100 --> 00:15:58,760
After waiting 5 minutes...

516
00:16:00,700 --> 00:16:02,500
Can I open it?

517
00:16:04,700 --> 00:16:06,400
It looks good.

518
00:16:06,400 --> 00:16:09,560
And how does it taste?

519
00:16:08,530 --> 00:16:10,130
Damn, that looks good.

520
00:16:09,560 --> 00:16:12,000
Well since I cooked it myself, it tastes really good.

521
00:16:13,380 --> 00:16:19,860
After exiting the shop, Hamada again...

522
00:16:14,360 --> 00:16:20,000
And after leaving the shop, Hamada again...

523
00:16:20,900 --> 00:16:23,630
Well if you make something yourself, anything will taste good.

526
00:16:24,000 --> 00:16:35,810
Thinking no-one heard what he said the first time
he really grinds to get heard a second time:

527
00:16:28,930 --> 00:16:32,830
'Really grinds to get heard a second time'

528
00:16:29,670 --> 00:16:35,810
anything will taste good.

529
00:16:29,670 --> 00:16:35,810
If you make something yourself,

So hot...

533
00:16:37,300 --> 00:16:41,930
Before we know it, we have arrived at the entrance of Enoshima temple.

534
00:16:41,510 --> 00:16:46,380
Enoshima Temple

535
00:16:42,560 --> 00:16:47,160
Enoshima has the three Gods of wealth

536
00:16:46,650 --> 00:16:59,260
Three Gods protect the temple.
After climbing 326 steps, you can get a great view of your surroundings.

546
00:17:19,200 --> 00:17:21,120

Okay yeah...this is a bit....

553
00:17:35,460 --> 00:17:37,130
So we are right at the top now?

554
00:17:37,200 --> 00:17:38,500

He next comes across

a street performance taking place.

It was here the whole time.

Do we need a part with me eating (for the Hamada Bamyu Bamyu PV)?

You're not eating at all!

I am!

00:21:09,630 --> 00:21:12,060
You really don't eat at all, do you?

648
00:21:12,060 --> 00:21:14,260
I'm eating so much.

649
00:21:14,260 --> 00:21:17,160
If you don't eat and can still do everything normally,

there's only one explanation for it...

a very Hamada-like quote:

Well that's understandable...

667
00:21:53,320 --> 00:21:55,760
To be honest, that was also

668
00:21:53,860 --> 00:21:55,760
a quote

First thing when I leave here, I'm going to smack Yanaoka!

675
00:21:59,630 --> 00:22:01,300
This is just ridiculous!

676
00:22:01,300 --> 00:22:06,300
I can't actually believe they would lie to me...

677
00:22:02,230 --> 00:22:06,300
I can't actually believe they would lie to me...

678
00:22:06,600 --> 00:22:09,100
But that lie got all those quotes...

679
00:22:09,100 --> 00:22:11,840
They're not quotes! It's just me reacting!

680
00:22:11,840 --> 00:22:13,280
What's your favourite?

681
00:22:13,280 --> 00:22:14,140
For me it's the  'Bara-zushi'

682
00:22:14,140 --> 00:22:17,850
For me it's the  'Bara-zushi'

683
00:22:16,760 --> 00:22:17,850
That is a great one!

684
00:22:17,930 --> 00:22:19,020
For me though, it has to be

685
00:22:19,020 --> 00:22:22,890
'They don't eat Gozen though, right?

686
00:22:22,900 --> 00:22:25,400
It's got that Tsukkomi in it as well

687
00:22:25,400 --> 00:22:28,860
and it just compliments the phrase really...

688
00:22:28,860 --> 00:22:34,530
'Miyane-ya is Yomiuri TV though'

689
00:22:31,930 --> 00:22:34,530
is something I will remember for a while, too...

690
00:22:35,000 --> 00:22:38,100
I'll just remember that if something bad ever happens...

691
00:22:38,100 --> 00:22:40,330
I'm honestly shocked.

692
00:22:40,330 --> 00:22:43,860
Seriously, we have no working relationship (staff).

There's another great quote.

697
00:22:44,830 --> 00:22:45,960
No no no.

698
00:22:45,960 --> 00:22:48,560
I seriously understand what Yama-chan was going on about now.

699
00:22:48,560 --> 00:22:49,610
Hang on a minute...

700
00:22:49,610 --> 00:22:53,280
Who here actually

701
00:22:51,250 --> 00:22:53,280
trusts the Gaki staff??

702
00:22:53,280 --> 00:22:54,280
Yama-chan and I don't trust them at all.

703
00:22:54,280 --> 00:22:55,150
Yama-chan and I don't trust them at all.

704
00:22:55,150 --> 00:22:55,890
I don't trust them at all either.

705
00:22:55,890 --> 00:22:57,890
I don't trust them at all either.

706
00:22:58,630 --> 00:22:59,660
I don't trust them at all.

707
00:22:59,660 --> 00:23:00,620
I've had a lot of shit happen to me,

708
00:23:00,620 --> 00:23:04,860
I've had a lot of shit happen to me,

709
00:23:02,090 --> 00:23:04,860
so I don't trust them,

710
00:23:02,830 --> 00:23:05,800
Seriously, they've got me real bad in the past,

711
00:23:05,960 --> 00:23:07,260
From the moment they got Endo really badly,

712
00:23:07,260 --> 00:23:10,400
From the moment they got Endo really badly,

713
00:23:07,260 --> 00:23:10,400
I've never trusted them.

714
00:23:10,400 --> 00:23:11,570
The trust died 20 years ago.

715
00:23:11,570 --> 00:23:13,600
The trust died 20 years ago.

716
00:23:12,460 --> 00:23:13,760
20 years ago, right?

717
00:23:13,760 --> 00:23:15,500
No one trusts the staff in the slightest.

718
00:23:15,500 --> 00:23:17,200
It's so ridiculous.

719
00:23:17,200 --> 00:23:19,530
Wait, did Inamoto know or not?

720
00:23:18,440 --> 00:24:09,690
This video was brought to you by Tofu Panda Fansubs

721
00:23:19,530 --> 00:23:21,730
He didn't know?

722
00:23:19,830 --> 00:23:21,730
No, he didn't.

723
00:23:21,730 --> 00:23:24,900
So Inamoto, you were tricked too along with me.

724
00:23:25,500 --> 00:23:32,100
There was a camera next to me the whole time and I was thinking, "Is it rolling or not?"

725
00:23:32,100 --> 00:23:34,100
But you've just listened to this whole conversation.

726
00:23:34,100 --> 00:23:40,960
What do you think? You might have been pranked but how do you feel personally?

727
00:23:40,960 --> 00:23:43,400
I'm really touched.

728
00:23:41,830 --> 00:23:43,400
Right?

729
00:23:43,400 --> 00:23:45,160
That's exactly it.

730
00:23:45,160 --> 00:23:47,160
We got to do a great episode together.

731
00:23:50,060 --> 00:23:52,060
He's so touched by this experience.
