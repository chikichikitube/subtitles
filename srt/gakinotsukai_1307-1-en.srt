00:00:08,370 --> 00:00:09,860
Alright!

6
00:00:10,030 --> 00:00:12,650
Isn't he being really quiet?

7
00:00:13,370 --> 00:00:14,120
You think so?

8
00:00:14,300 --> 00:00:14,470
Maybe you're about to die?

9
00:00:14,470 --> 00:00:15,160
It's because you're always telling me I'm loud!
Maybe you're about to die?

10
00:00:15,160 --> 00:00:15,860
It's because you're always telling me I'm loud!

11
00:00:15,860 --> 00:00:16,810
You gonna die, or what?
It's because you're always telling me I'm loud!

12
00:00:16,810 --> 00:00:16,890
It's because you're always telling me I'm loud!

13
00:00:17,070 --> 00:00:17,560
Right, he always says that.

14
00:00:17,560 --> 00:00:18,450
But Hamada is always saying how much he hates this program.
Right, he always says that.

15
00:00:18,450 --> 00:00:20,320
But Hamada is always saying how much he hates this program.

16
00:00:21,030 --> 00:00:21,610
Do you hate it?

17
00:00:21,610 --> 00:00:21,970
Please, just don't go home!
Do you hate it?

18
00:00:21,970 --> 00:00:23,000
Please, just don't go home!

19
00:00:24,400 --> 00:00:27,560
Actually Tanaka, what kind of bugs does this tree house?

20
00:00:27,940 --> 00:00:29,870
Well this tree probably...

21
00:00:29,870 --> 00:00:30,990
You ain't got to force a follow up!
Well this tree probably...

22
00:00:30,990 --> 00:00:31,360
You ain't got to force a follow up!

23
00:00:31,470 --> 00:00:32,970
I think this is a Ginko tree...

24
00:00:33,380 --> 00:00:34,900
So there must be a reasonable amount of bugs living here.

25
00:00:36,960 --> 00:00:38,340
This is our sixth time!

26
00:00:38,440 --> 00:00:39,890
Our sixth time?!

27
00:00:40,440 --> 00:00:42,070
We met Mr. Gajiro Sato last time.

28
00:00:42,070 --> 00:00:43,070
Right, Mr. Gajiro.

29
00:00:44,330 --> 00:00:47,530
This is our sixth time shooting this program!

30
00:00:49,100 --> 00:00:50,400
I found it!

31
00:00:52,570 --> 00:00:53,270
Hello!

32
00:00:53,270 --> 00:00:53,970
Amazing!

33
00:00:54,010 --> 00:00:55,280
Hello!

34
00:00:56,450 --> 00:01:00,030
They guys have successfully managed to meet countless celebrities!

35
00:01:01,400 --> 00:01:02,670
What are you doing here?!

36
00:01:02,910 --> 00:01:04,950
He's got a ton of tissues!

37
00:01:06,260 --> 00:01:07,520
It's so raw!

38
00:01:08,900 --> 00:01:10,270
Super raw!

39
00:01:11,550 --> 00:01:14,680
And this time around, they'll be searching this area!

40
00:01:15,600 --> 00:01:17,930
Shimokitazawa in Setagaya Ward!

41
00:01:19,060 --> 00:01:23,270
A town of culture, full of theater and fashion!

42
00:01:24,600 --> 00:01:31,200
Shimokitazawa is full of celebrities!
But the guys cannot go home until they find one. A harsh challenge awaits them!

43
00:01:32,090 --> 00:01:33,840
Everyone, what do you think of Shimokitazawa?

44
00:01:34,180 --> 00:01:34,970
Do you come here often?

45
00:01:35,750 --> 00:01:38,100
I haven't been here in a while.

46
00:01:38,420 --> 00:01:39,410
I used to live here.

47
00:01:40,090 --> 00:01:41,150
Right, you lived so close.

48
00:01:41,280 --> 00:01:42,370
Tanaka and I did.

49
00:01:42,660 --> 00:01:44,770
Yes, I also lived around here for over 10 years.

50
00:01:44,770 --> 00:01:45,160
So what's the deal? Are there a lot of celebs walking around?
Yes, I also lived around here for over 10 years.

51
00:01:45,160 --> 00:01:47,480
So what's the deal? Are there a lot of celebs walking around?

52
00:01:47,830 --> 00:01:52,410
I have met Jun Itoda from Speed Wago walking around.
(He participated in Documental S4)

53
00:01:52,470 --> 00:01:55,840
I've also heard of celebrities holding concerts around here.

54
00:01:58,200 --> 00:01:58,870
Something's up.

55
00:01:59,030 --> 00:01:59,530
A musician?

56
00:01:59,720 --> 00:02:00,940
There are a ton of band members around here.

57
00:02:00,940 --> 00:02:01,940
-Band members?
-Yeah, band members!

58
00:02:01,980 --> 00:02:03,880
And a lot of theater people.

59
00:02:03,880 --> 00:02:05,220
Thereâ€™s a ton of them!

60
00:02:06,110 --> 00:02:09,770
Let's stroll around until we find a celebrity!
Shimokitazawa Edition!

61
00:02:10,600 --> 00:02:11,570
These are the rules:

62
00:02:11,700 --> 00:02:14,870
The shoot won't end until we meet a celebrity.

63
00:02:15,520 --> 00:02:20,430
However, all members must know the celebrity's name.

64
00:02:21,660 --> 00:02:24,730
And naturally, we also need filming consent from their respective agencies.

65
00:02:25,780 --> 00:02:30,590
Now, will the guys find any celebrities in Komazawa?!

66
00:02:32,370 --> 00:02:34,200
The time is 4:10 P.M.

67
00:02:34,730 --> 00:02:37,730
Under the shining sun, the show starts!

68
00:02:38,300 --> 00:02:40,540

This is just the season in which all the celebs start coming out.

72
00:02:45,920 --> 00:02:50,500
The guys are headed to the southern gate shopping district first!

73
00:02:52,240 --> 00:02:54,270
It's really been a while since I've been back here.

74
00:02:54,780 --> 00:02:57,200
It really has.

75
00:02:57,400 --> 00:02:58,970
Right, we used to come here all the time, didn't we?

76
00:02:58,970 --> 00:02:59,240
Yeah, we did come a lot back then.

78
00:03:02,060 --> 00:03:04,600
Tanaka is ready to go!

79
00:03:07,590 --> 00:03:08,540
Oh my god!

80
00:03:09,470 --> 00:03:12,130
Have they found their celebrities already?!

81
00:03:25,440 --> 00:03:29,030
Let's stroll around until we find a celebrity!

87
00:03:39,610 --> 00:03:42,470
A few minutes after starting, Tanaka spots someone!

88
00:03:45,320 --> 00:03:46,380
Ah! Over there!

89
00:03:47,230 --> 00:03:47,680
Who?

90
00:03:50,520 --> 00:03:51,870
We're done!

91
00:03:52,000 --> 00:03:52,700
It's over, right?

92
00:03:55,120 --> 00:03:57,430
Sorry for disturbing you in your private time.

93
00:03:57,430 --> 00:03:57,710
No worries.
Sorry for disturbing you in your private time.

94
00:03:57,710 --> 00:03:57,800
No worries.

95
00:03:58,420 --> 00:04:00,200
You're married right?

96
00:04:00,790 --> 00:04:03,330
-We sat next to you at Moto Sano's concert.
-Right, we did!

97
00:04:05,160 --> 00:04:07,050
Matsumoto has no clue!

98
00:04:08,090 --> 00:04:09,210
He completely forgot.

99
00:04:09,210 --> 00:04:09,680
I mean, I specifically went there to see Motoharu Sano!
He completely forgot.

100
00:04:09,680 --> 00:04:11,690
I mean, I specifically went there to see Motoharu Sano!

101
00:04:11,730 --> 00:04:13,090
I didn't see who was sitting next to me!

102
00:04:16,240 --> 00:04:18,080
Excuse us for a minute.

103
00:04:18,110 --> 00:04:19,280
Just a moment please.

104
00:04:19,990 --> 00:04:21,720
I have no clue.

105
00:04:21,720 --> 00:04:22,070
Who are they?
I have no clue.

106
00:04:22,070 --> 00:04:22,330
Who are they?

107
00:04:22,690 --> 00:04:23,420
Chocolat.

108
00:04:23,590 --> 00:04:23,800
Huh?

109
00:04:23,920 --> 00:04:25,260
Chocolat, they're musicians.

110
00:04:25,500 --> 00:04:26,550
Chocolat?

111
00:04:27,500 --> 00:04:28,740
What? THAT Chocolat?

112
00:04:30,230 --> 00:04:31,600
What's with you?

113
00:04:34,640 --> 00:04:36,260
Chocolat and Akito!

114
00:04:38,240 --> 00:04:43,830
Formed in 2005, this duo is composed of husband and wife, Chocolat and Akito.

115
00:04:44,950 --> 00:04:51,680
Regarded for their musicality and individuality, this duo has been highly regarded in the Japanese music world!

116
00:04:53,000 --> 00:04:54,560
Are you sure they are famous?

117
00:04:54,560 --> 00:04:54,760
Yes, I'm very very sure.
Are you sure they are famous?

118
00:04:54,760 --> 00:04:56,020
Yes, I'm very very sure.

119
00:04:56,150 --> 00:04:56,730
What about you?

120
00:04:57,050 --> 00:04:58,090
Of course I know them.

121
00:04:58,360 --> 00:04:59,530
Stop lying!

122
00:04:59,670 --> 00:05:00,400
Come on man...

123
00:05:00,400 --> 00:05:00,900
Stop joking around!
Come on man...

124
00:05:00,900 --> 00:05:01,750
Stop joking around!

125
00:05:01,890 --> 00:05:02,540
(TL Note: In the episode aired on May 15, 2016, the guys were trying to make Hamada say the phrase: "Stop joking around" on the day of his birthday, but he never said the words.)
You said it!

126
00:05:02,540 --> 00:05:03,440
(TL Note: In the episode aired on May 15, 2016, the guys were trying to make Hamada say the phrase: "Stop joking around" on the day of his birthday, but he never said the words.)

Why did you say it now?
(TL Note: In the episode aired on May 15, 2016, the guys were trying to make Hamada say the phrase: "Stop joking around" on the day of his birthday, but he never said the words.)

132
00:05:10,340 --> 00:05:12,460
We wanted you to say it back then!

133
00:05:12,810 --> 00:05:14,480
You're just casually blurting it out now?

134
00:05:14,480 --> 00:05:15,980
Never mind, forget about it!

135
00:05:16,110 --> 00:05:17,110
Sorry about that.

136
00:05:17,210 --> 00:05:21,070
So sorry... By the way, what are you doing around here?

137
00:05:21,920 --> 00:05:22,980
We were just strolling around.

138
00:05:23,040 --> 00:05:26,060
-Is that so? Sorry to disturb you.
-No, don't worry.

139
00:05:26,660 --> 00:05:28,330
Do you guys live around here?

140
00:05:28,590 --> 00:05:29,330
-Ah no...
-Not at all.

141
00:05:29,390 --> 00:05:31,090
We were just coming back from a gig.

142
00:05:31,540 --> 00:05:31,960
Oh, you had a gig?

143
00:05:31,960 --> 00:05:32,630
Oh no, we just came to see one of our friend's performances.
Oh, you had a gig?

144
00:05:32,630 --> 00:05:34,450
Oh no, we just came to see one of our friend's performances.

145
00:05:34,490 --> 00:05:35,400
Oh, is that so?

146
00:05:35,440 --> 00:05:37,250
You're on your private time, right?

147
00:05:37,310 --> 00:05:38,470
-You're not working, right?
-That's right.

148
00:05:39,060 --> 00:05:42,560
But we did meet at Motoharu Sano's concert.

149
00:05:43,630 --> 00:05:46,770
No one but Tanaka could name them.
The task is not cleared!

150
00:05:47,890 --> 00:05:48,600
Thank you.

151
00:05:48,610 --> 00:05:50,870
-That was so fast!
-Thank you for everything!

152
00:05:51,860 --> 00:05:52,910
Tanaka was the only one who knew!

153
00:05:52,910 --> 00:05:53,700
Of course!

154
00:05:53,850 --> 00:05:54,730
Are they famous?

155
00:05:54,910 --> 00:05:57,020
Yes, they are super famous.

156
00:05:57,340 --> 00:05:58,040
Really?

157
00:05:58,040 --> 00:05:59,220
Yes, really.

158
00:05:59,700 --> 00:06:01,270
I've heard their names.

159
00:06:01,620 --> 00:06:02,300
I have heard of them.

160
00:06:02,300 --> 00:06:02,670
You stop joking-
I have heard of them.

161
00:06:02,670 --> 00:06:04,010
You stop joking-

162
00:06:04,040 --> 00:06:04,930
There you go again...

163
00:06:05,600 --> 00:06:06,850
You said it again.

164
00:06:07,220 --> 00:06:08,700
He was like: "Chocolat?!".

165
00:06:08,720 --> 00:06:10,980
If you say "Stop joking around" again, I'm leaving.

166
00:06:12,460 --> 00:06:13,690
I'm making that an extra rule!

167
00:06:14,590 --> 00:06:15,660
He just said it again!

168
00:06:15,660 --> 00:06:19,590
He was like: "Stop joking..." and stopped in the middle.

169
00:06:19,590 --> 00:06:21,550
You sure are chatty today!

170
00:06:21,550 --> 00:06:21,720
I just can't believe it!
You sure are chatty today!

171
00:06:21,720 --> 00:06:23,090
I just can't believe it!

172
00:06:23,090 --> 00:06:23,140
For real!
I just can't believe it!

173
00:06:23,140 --> 00:06:23,970
For real!

174
00:06:24,910 --> 00:06:26,260
A wonderful start!

175
00:06:26,600 --> 00:06:29,900
Now, the guys head to the theater area, where plenty of people are waiting around!

176
00:06:30,530 --> 00:06:32,350
This is where the theaters are, right?

177
00:06:32,460 --> 00:06:33,360
-That's right.
-Yes.

178
00:06:33,660 --> 00:06:35,400
There's a surprising amount of theaters around here.

179
00:06:35,570 --> 00:06:37,220
And they're all super famous, like the Honda Theater.

180
00:06:37,220 --> 00:06:37,910
Yeah, the Honda Theater.
And they're all super famous, like the Honda Theater.

181
00:06:37,910 --> 00:06:38,370
Yeah, the Honda Theater.

182
00:06:39,330 --> 00:06:42,390
And there's just apartments on top of the Honda Theater, huh?

183
00:06:42,450 --> 00:06:43,450
Yes.

184
00:06:43,600 --> 00:06:44,400
That's amazing!

185
00:06:45,080 --> 00:06:46,270
I never knew that!

186
00:06:47,090 --> 00:06:52,240
But this is gonna be hard... I don't know the names of any musicians or theater actors...

187
00:06:53,920 --> 00:06:55,250
I'm never gonna know who they are.

188
00:06:55,250 --> 00:06:55,970
We just have to do another lap and we'll run into Chocolat again.
I'm never gonna know who they are.

189
00:06:55,970 --> 00:06:59,840
We just have to do another lap and we'll run into Chocolat again.

190
00:07:00,290 --> 00:07:01,490
And we'll be done.

191
00:07:01,490 --> 00:07:02,800
But wouldn't that be super inconvenient?

192
00:07:02,970 --> 00:07:04,250
Oh my, look at this.

193
00:07:04,250 --> 00:07:04,780
Oh, it's Okada Ijiri.
Oh my, look at this.

194
00:07:04,780 --> 00:07:05,100
Oh, it's Okada Ijiri.

195
00:07:05,820 --> 00:07:06,620
So, today...
(It's customary to send a bouquet of flowers when a new play is opening)

196
00:07:07,130 --> 00:07:07,970
Hide Nakayama!

197
00:07:09,180 --> 00:07:11,920
Oh but it doesn't necessarily mean they're here.

198
00:07:12,280 --> 00:07:13,570
They must be working here.

199
00:07:13,860 --> 00:07:14,800
Oh, right.

200
00:07:14,830 --> 00:07:16,930
We might be able to catch some of them if we wait around.

201
00:07:17,160 --> 00:07:18,230
But we'd have to wait around.

202
00:07:18,300 --> 00:07:19,470
So this is also a theater?

203
00:07:19,620 --> 00:07:20,000
Yes.

204
00:07:20,220 --> 00:07:21,640
Tanaka, keep an eye out.

205
00:07:21,640 --> 00:07:22,850
I am.

206
00:07:22,980 --> 00:07:24,880
I just feel like this is your day.

207
00:07:24,940 --> 00:07:26,330
For real.

208
00:07:26,830 --> 00:07:28,690
I'm so mad, we could have ended the shoot so quickly...

209
00:07:28,690 --> 00:07:29,350
It really would have been the shortest episode.
I'm so mad, we could have ended the shoot so quickly...

210
00:07:29,350 --> 00:07:30,770
It really would have been the shortest episode.

211
00:07:30,960 --> 00:07:32,220
We wouldn't even have had enough footage.

212
00:07:32,560 --> 00:07:33,600
I'm expecting big things today.

213
00:07:33,600 --> 00:07:33,970
Me too.
I'm expecting big things today.

214
00:07:33,970 --> 00:07:34,400
Me too.

215
00:07:34,790 --> 00:07:37,300
Is Shimokitazawa big?

216
00:07:37,430 --> 00:07:38,890
Well, yes. It has all kinds of areas.

217
00:07:38,890 --> 00:07:39,350
Really?
Well, yes. It has all kinds of areas.

218
00:07:39,350 --> 00:07:40,200
Really?

219
00:07:40,500 --> 00:07:41,650
But it sure has changed!

220
00:07:41,650 --> 00:07:42,400
It has!
But it sure has changed!

221
00:07:42,400 --> 00:07:42,550
It has!

222
00:07:42,550 --> 00:07:42,780
For real.
It has!

223
00:07:42,780 --> 00:07:43,170
For real.

224
00:07:43,170 --> 00:07:43,430
It's completely different!
For real.

225
00:07:43,430 --> 00:07:44,200
It's completely different!

226
00:07:45,130 --> 00:07:47,480
All the stores from the past have disappeared.

227
00:07:47,770 --> 00:07:48,510
Yes...

228
00:07:48,530 --> 00:07:50,160
Has it been about 10 years since you were last here?

229
00:07:50,360 --> 00:07:51,510
Ah! The train station is gone!

230
00:07:51,530 --> 00:07:52,210
The station is gone...

231
00:07:52,210 --> 00:07:52,530
Everything went underground.
The station is gone...

232
00:07:52,530 --> 00:07:53,130
Everything went underground.

233
00:07:53,150 --> 00:07:54,600
Oh, right!

234
00:07:55,720 --> 00:07:58,230
There used to be an intersection here, but now everything's underground.

235
00:07:58,230 --> 00:07:58,670
I met up with so many people in this station!
There used to be an intersection here, but now everything's underground.

236
00:07:58,670 --> 00:08:00,900
I met up with so many people in this station!

237
00:08:01,880 --> 00:08:02,700
Here?
Yeah!

238
00:08:04,260 --> 00:08:07,650
Shocked by the town's transformation, the guys keep looking!

239
00:08:10,050 --> 00:08:10,950
She could be famous.

240
00:08:10,950 --> 00:08:11,440
She must be a celebrity.
She could be famous.

241
00:08:11,440 --> 00:08:12,030
She must be a celebrity.

242
00:08:12,030 --> 00:08:12,300
Should I ask?
She must be a celebrity.

243
00:08:12,300 --> 00:08:12,870
Should I ask?

244
00:08:12,920 --> 00:08:13,490
A celeb?

245
00:08:13,490 --> 00:08:13,740
They've found a candidate!
A celeb?

246
00:08:13,740 --> 00:08:15,090
They've found a candidate!

247
00:08:15,400 --> 00:08:17,970
Hosei and Tanaka spring into action!

248
00:08:18,160 --> 00:08:18,750
Are you a celebrity?

249
00:08:18,750 --> 00:08:18,880
It's either a very fashionable girl, or a model whose name I don't know.
Are you a celebrity?

250
00:08:18,880 --> 00:08:22,790
It's either a very fashionable girl, or a model whose name I don't know.

251
00:08:23,700 --> 00:08:26,690
But he's taking a while...

252
00:08:29,100 --> 00:08:30,130
How was it?

253
00:08:30,880 --> 00:08:31,220
No luck.

254
00:08:31,280 --> 00:08:32,370
So it was just a fashionable girl.

255
00:08:32,600 --> 00:08:33,140
Indeed.

256
00:08:34,010 --> 00:08:36,040
But you took so long to ask though...

257
00:08:36,530 --> 00:08:37,570
-She was pretty cute.
-Right?

258
00:08:37,690 --> 00:08:39,560
She has the aura of a celeb.

259
00:08:39,720 --> 00:08:40,600
Is this the station?

260
00:08:41,020 --> 00:08:42,830
Yes, but all of this used to be on a second story.

261
00:08:43,280 --> 00:08:46,070
Before, you'd climb some stairs to get here.

262
00:08:46,300 --> 00:08:47,370
Is that so?

263
00:08:48,700 --> 00:08:53,900
Once again, the guys head towards the shopping district's south entrance, and begin their search northbound.

264
00:09:00,420 --> 00:09:00,900
Did you spot anyone?

265
00:09:00,900 --> 00:09:01,070
The girl with the coffee could be.
Did you spot anyone?

266
00:09:01,070 --> 00:09:03,060
The girl with the coffee could be.

267
00:09:03,520 --> 00:09:05,690
She looks like she could be someone.

268
00:09:06,030 --> 00:09:07,160
Or maybe it's just another fashionable girl.

269
00:09:07,160 --> 00:09:07,310
She looks very scared.
Or maybe it's just another fashionable girl.

270
00:09:07,310 --> 00:09:08,380
She looks very scared.

271
00:09:08,590 --> 00:09:09,910
Of course she'd be scared.

272
00:09:10,140 --> 00:09:11,590
Tanaka is scary.

273
00:09:11,950 --> 00:09:13,100
She was just another fashionable girl.

274
00:09:13,870 --> 00:09:14,930
No luck.

275
00:09:15,200 --> 00:09:16,030
No luck.

276
00:09:16,120 --> 00:09:17,400
This is such a fashionable town!

277
00:09:17,400 --> 00:09:17,850
She's not a celebrity, right?
This is such a fashionable town!

278
00:09:17,850 --> 00:09:18,570
She's not a celebrity, right?

279
00:09:19,750 --> 00:09:23,400
So... Wait... Which way was Ohsho?
(Japanese restaurant chain)

280
00:09:23,400 --> 00:09:23,840
It's over here.
So... Wait... Which way was Ohsho?
(Japanese restaurant chain)

281
00:09:23,840 --> 00:09:24,600
It's over here.

282
00:09:25,230 --> 00:09:26,420
I wanna eat some gyoza.

283
00:09:26,700 --> 00:09:27,300
Again?

284
00:09:27,400 --> 00:09:27,860
Yeah...

285
00:09:27,870 --> 00:09:30,350
You were saying the same thing last time.
"I wanna eat gyoza"

286
00:09:30,350 --> 00:09:30,660
I mean, I never get to go to Ohsho unless we're filming.
You were saying the same thing last time.
"I wanna eat gyoza"

287
00:09:30,660 --> 00:09:35,780
I mean, I never get to go to Ohsho unless we're filming.

288
00:09:35,780 --> 00:09:36,510
Right...

289
00:09:36,960 --> 00:09:37,800
We never go.

290
00:09:38,130 --> 00:09:39,330
Let's eat some gyoza, come on.

291
00:09:40,370 --> 00:09:41,160
Gyoza!

292
00:09:41,910 --> 00:09:44,210
I also wanna stop by the pharmacy!

293
00:09:45,380 --> 00:09:47,370
Search inside the stores, you bastards!

294
00:09:47,980 --> 00:09:48,780
We're looking...

295
00:09:48,780 --> 00:09:51,240
You're just walking around doing nothing!
What show do you think you're on?!

296
00:09:52,350 --> 00:09:55,170
You guys have to look at both sides of the street!

297
00:09:55,290 --> 00:09:58,030
There's no need to be on edge on this show.

298
00:09:59,330 --> 00:10:01,270
Just pay attention, that's all.

299
00:10:02,050 --> 00:10:02,560
They could be inside these stores.

300
00:10:02,560 --> 00:10:03,630
You're right, Hamada has been looking in the stores this whole time.
They could be inside these stores.

301
00:10:03,630 --> 00:10:04,780
You're right, Hamada has been looking in the stores this whole time.

302
00:10:04,910 --> 00:10:06,110
This brings me back!

303
00:10:06,110 --> 00:10:06,720
This one's really famous, right?
This brings me back!

304
00:10:06,720 --> 00:10:07,430
This one's really famous, right?

305
00:10:07,610 --> 00:10:09,570
It brings me ba-
Hello!

306
00:10:09,680 --> 00:10:10,850
I used to come here all the time!

307
00:10:10,850 --> 00:10:11,320
You brought us here, remember?
I used to come here all the time!

308
00:10:11,320 --> 00:10:12,970
You brought us here, remember?

309
00:10:12,970 --> 00:10:14,080
Right, right, right.

310
00:10:14,080 --> 00:10:14,130
Hosei brought us here one time.
Right, right, right.

311
00:10:14,130 --> 00:10:14,750
Hosei brought us here one time.

312
00:10:14,750 --> 00:10:15,530
It's really good.
Hosei brought us here one time.

313
00:10:15,530 --> 00:10:16,180
It's really good.

314
00:10:16,250 --> 00:10:17,350
It looks delicious.

315
00:10:17,350 --> 00:10:17,730
Yes, it's very good.
It looks delicious.

316
00:10:17,730 --> 00:10:18,250
Yes, it's very good.

317
00:10:18,250 --> 00:10:18,620
I remember when you brought us out here.
Yes, it's very good.

318
00:10:18,620 --> 00:10:19,770
I remember when you brought us out here.

319
00:10:20,460 --> 00:10:22,690
-Are you guys looking?
-It's fine, we'll be fine.

320
00:10:23,550 --> 00:10:24,180
We're looking, we are.

321
00:10:24,250 --> 00:10:25,250
I'm looking really hard.

322
00:10:25,690 --> 00:10:30,650
We have to be quick or all the celebs will realize we're here.

323
00:10:30,700 --> 00:10:31,770
Right.

324
00:10:32,160 --> 00:10:33,180
They'll run away.

325
00:10:33,180 --> 00:10:33,330
Those guys always run away...
They'll run away.

326
00:10:33,330 --> 00:10:34,040
Those guys always run away...

327
00:10:34,040 --> 00:10:35,330
We have to be quicker than them.
Those guys always run away...

328
00:10:35,330 --> 00:10:36,030
We have to be quicker than them.

329
00:10:36,460 --> 00:10:38,570
If we found some celebs from overseas I don't think I'd know...

330
00:10:38,620 --> 00:10:40,030
Right, me either...

331
00:10:41,140 --> 00:10:46,180
It's been 20 minutes since the guys started searching.
And now they are near Matsumoto's dear gyoza.

332
00:10:46,810 --> 00:10:49,880
Alright, let's have a strategy meeting while we gulp down some gyoza!

333
00:10:49,880 --> 00:10:50,190
We told you, no gyoza!
Alright, let's have a strategy meeting while we gulp down some gyoza!

334
00:10:50,190 --> 00:10:51,600
We told you, no gyoza!

335
00:10:52,350 --> 00:10:52,900
Why?

336
00:10:52,900 --> 00:10:55,330
No one wants to eat gyoza!

337
00:10:55,550 --> 00:10:56,730
Come on, let's go.

338
00:10:57,400 --> 00:10:58,730
No way.

339
00:10:59,310 --> 00:11:01,570
-This is so embarrassing!
-It's super empty!

340
00:11:01,630 --> 00:11:02,530
Right.

341
00:11:03,000 --> 00:11:04,570
It'd be really nice...

342
00:11:04,870 --> 00:11:06,870
It's super empty now, we can get some gyoza, come on.

343
00:11:06,870 --> 00:11:09,300
What does that have to do with anything?

344
00:11:09,830 --> 00:11:10,680
Let's keep searching!

345
00:11:10,680 --> 00:11:14,950
We can eat some of that Japanese food afterwards if we only get one portion of gyoza now.

346
00:11:16,610 --> 00:11:18,670
This is not a food show, man.

347
00:11:18,880 --> 00:11:20,340
We're looking for celebrities here.

348
00:11:20,340 --> 00:11:22,730
But look, it's so empty inside...

349
00:11:23,180 --> 00:11:26,360
We can eat some gyoza and have a look through the window. It'll be alright.

350
00:11:26,380 --> 00:11:27,100
No, no, no...

351
00:11:27,240 --> 00:11:29,480
You guys don't want some gyoza?

352
00:11:31,130 --> 00:11:32,230
You guys don't want some gyoza?

353
00:11:32,840 --> 00:11:33,570
Not really...

354
00:11:35,410 --> 00:11:36,330
No way!

355
00:11:36,840 --> 00:11:37,530
Do you guys want some?

356
00:11:38,000 --> 00:11:39,890
Now that you ask me... I don't really wanna eat....

357
00:11:39,890 --> 00:11:40,290
For real?
Are you guys stupid?
Now that you ask me... I don't really wanna eat....

358
00:11:40,290 --> 00:11:41,760
For real?
Are you guys stupid?

359
00:11:42,640 --> 00:11:43,640
I don't wanna eat right now either...

360
00:11:43,640 --> 00:11:44,900
I really hate all the Gaki members!
I don't wanna eat right now either...

361
00:11:44,900 --> 00:11:46,500
I really hate all the Gaki members!

362
00:11:46,760 --> 00:11:48,270
Do you wanna eat gyoza that badly?

363
00:11:49,180 --> 00:11:50,480
There's gotta be someone around here!

364
00:11:50,480 --> 00:11:50,960
Yes, I'm sure of it too.
There's gotta be someone around here!

365
00:11:50,960 --> 00:11:52,500
Yes, I'm sure of it too.

366
00:11:52,660 --> 00:11:55,610
But celebrities don't come to crowded places like this.

367
00:11:55,670 --> 00:11:56,980
-Right...
-We have to move away.

368
00:11:56,980 --> 00:11:57,100
They would never come around here.
-Right...
-We have to move away.

369
00:11:57,100 --> 00:11:57,820
They would never come around here.

370
00:11:58,240 --> 00:12:00,240
And there's a ton of very fashionable girls here...

371
00:12:00,240 --> 00:12:00,630
Totally.
And there's a ton of very fashionable girls here...

372
00:12:00,630 --> 00:12:01,170
Totally.

373
00:12:01,170 --> 00:12:01,410
-Like... You really can't tell.
-Yeah, you can't tell.
Totally.

374
00:12:01,410 --> 00:12:04,460
-Like... You really can't tell.
-Yeah, you can't tell.

375
00:12:04,530 --> 00:12:07,250
Everyone is just dressed too nice.

376
00:12:07,260 --> 00:12:07,630
Yes.

377
00:12:10,290 --> 00:12:13,400
Sir, have you seen any celebrities today?

378
00:12:13,610 --> 00:12:15,210
Not today, no.

379
00:12:15,210 --> 00:12:15,890
Oh really?
Not today, no.

380
00:12:15,890 --> 00:12:16,180
Oh really?

381
00:12:16,210 --> 00:12:17,310
So, who do you usually see?

382
00:12:17,810 --> 00:12:18,730
Have you had any celebrity customers?

383
00:12:19,140 --> 00:12:20,060
We get a lot of musicians.

384
00:12:20,060 --> 00:12:20,370
Oh, musicians!
We get a lot of musicians.

385
00:12:20,370 --> 00:12:21,400
Oh, musicians!

386
00:12:21,510 --> 00:12:22,270
Artists.

387
00:12:22,420 --> 00:12:23,130
Artists...

388
00:12:23,250 --> 00:12:24,600
Artists, huh?

389
00:12:26,330 --> 00:12:28,250
You're already drinking beer?!
At this hour?

390
00:12:28,730 --> 00:12:29,560
Let him be!

391
00:12:29,730 --> 00:12:32,280
Please, just take it easy.

392
00:12:32,320 --> 00:12:35,100
Well, it's actually not that early.

393
00:12:35,100 --> 00:12:35,360
You think so?
Well, it's actually not that early.

394
00:12:35,360 --> 00:12:35,970
You think so?

395
00:12:35,990 --> 00:12:37,050
It's a bit early.

396
00:12:37,140 --> 00:12:38,650
-Tanaka keep your eyes peeled!
-Yes!

397
00:12:38,730 --> 00:12:38,780
You're the tallest of us all!

398
00:12:38,780 --> 00:12:40,440
That's right, Tanaka you bastard!
You're the tallest of us all!

399
00:12:40,440 --> 00:12:41,570
That's right, Tanaka you bastard!

400
00:12:42,390 --> 00:12:43,340
You're the giant of the group.

401
00:12:43,340 --> 00:12:44,740
I'm not that tall.

402
00:12:45,610 --> 00:12:47,700
Height is the most advantageous in this show.

403
00:12:47,700 --> 00:12:48,100
It doesn't make that much of a difference, you know?
Height is the most advantageous in this show.

404
00:12:48,100 --> 00:12:49,590
It doesn't make that much of a difference, you know?

405
00:12:49,620 --> 00:12:50,720
What's with you?

406
00:12:51,130 --> 00:12:52,690
You're as tall as an observatory.

407
00:12:53,910 --> 00:12:55,130
Look from your heights.

408
00:12:55,440 --> 00:12:56,400
Stretch!

409
00:12:56,810 --> 00:13:00,930
There's tons of really famous thrift shops ahead.

410
00:13:00,930 --> 00:13:01,640
Oh, really?
There's tons of really famous thrift shops ahead.

411
00:13:01,640 --> 00:13:01,670
There's tons of really famous thrift shops ahead.

412
00:13:01,670 --> 00:13:01,970
Let's go there.

414
00:13:02,750 --> 00:13:02,920
Alright, let's go.
Let's go there.

415
00:13:02,920 --> 00:13:03,750
Alright, let's go.

416
00:13:04,200 --> 00:13:05,840
Go and have a look inside.

417
00:13:06,280 --> 00:13:07,380
I'll go check the top floor.

418
00:13:07,500 --> 00:13:07,970
Alright.

419
00:13:08,740 --> 00:13:10,280
Is there a store on the second floor?

420
00:13:11,110 --> 00:13:15,770
Kokoriko go into the stores to look for potential celebrities!

421
00:13:17,120 --> 00:13:20,570
Will they find them?

422
00:13:25,860 --> 00:13:27,130
There were a lot of autographs hanging on the walls.

423
00:13:27,940 --> 00:13:30,030
And it looks like Kan Nabeya was in yesterday.

424
00:13:31,140 --> 00:13:32,340
He was here yesterday.

425
00:13:32,340 --> 00:13:32,530
I would have wanted to meet him.
He was here yesterday.

426
00:13:32,530 --> 00:13:33,630
I would have wanted to meet him.

427
00:13:33,640 --> 00:13:36,020
They also told me they get a lot of theater actors.

428
00:13:36,070 --> 00:13:37,600
Kan Nabeya thrifts, huh?

429
00:13:37,600 --> 00:13:37,800
There was also an autograph from the comedian, Yoshio Kojima.

There was also an autograph from the comedian, Yoshio Kojima.

431
00:13:41,510 --> 00:13:43,800
This area is famous.

432
00:13:44,110 --> 00:13:44,900
Oh, really?

433
00:13:45,370 --> 00:13:47,670
I guess celebs really do come around here.

434
00:13:47,930 --> 00:13:51,830
I can smell them closing in on us.

435
00:13:52,310 --> 00:13:54,020
But I feel like there's a lot more up-and-coming comedians around...

436
00:13:54,100 --> 00:13:55,170
Up-and-coming, not the really famous ones.

437
00:13:55,350 --> 00:13:56,180
Right, I think so too.

438
00:13:57,090 --> 00:14:00,670
And once again, Tanaka spots someone!

439
00:14:05,580 --> 00:14:11,130
Tanaka has found a certain famous female celebrity, but she is not allowed to appear on our program.
Not Clear!

440
00:14:11,410 --> 00:14:12,000
That was amazing.

441
00:14:12,000 --> 00:14:12,410
That was pretty wild.
That was amazing.

442
00:14:12,410 --> 00:14:13,630
That was pretty wild.

443
00:14:13,630 --> 00:14:13,920
As expected.
That was pretty wild.

444
00:14:13,920 --> 00:14:14,630
As expected.

445
00:14:15,620 --> 00:14:17,370
This is what we expected of Shimokitazawa.

446
00:14:17,580 --> 00:14:19,000
That was amazing.

447
00:14:19,200 --> 00:14:19,730
Right?

448
00:14:20,930 --> 00:14:25,370
Unfortunately we could not show her on camera but the boys have a refreshed sense of hope!

449
00:14:27,870 --> 00:14:31,250
There are very few people around here.

450
00:14:34,250 --> 00:14:35,810
Oh, something's going on.

451
00:14:35,870 --> 00:14:38,650
Some celebrities could be getting their hair cut.

452
00:14:39,490 --> 00:14:41,830
Have you seen any celebrities today?

453
00:14:42,070 --> 00:14:44,000
-We haven't seen any today.
-Really?

454
00:14:44,240 --> 00:14:46,290
Who do you usually see?

455
00:14:46,560 --> 00:14:47,070
It's not good.

456
00:14:47,440 --> 00:14:49,460
We get Mr. Emoto a lot.

457
00:14:49,970 --> 00:14:50,810
Mr. Emoto?

458
00:14:50,870 --> 00:14:51,670
Mr. Emoto?

459
00:14:51,730 --> 00:14:52,630
Akira Emoto?

460
00:14:52,690 --> 00:14:55,110
Which means his son could also be around.

461
00:14:55,200 --> 00:14:56,170
Actors, huh?

462
00:14:56,530 --> 00:14:57,600
I see.

463
00:14:58,020 --> 00:15:01,500
There really are a lot of celebrities in Shimokitazawa.

464
00:15:01,990 --> 00:15:06,690
Well yeah, we've already bumped into several people.

465
00:15:07,270 --> 00:15:08,930
Doesn't this bring you back, Tanaka?

466
00:15:09,250 --> 00:15:10,000
Yes, especially this area.

467
00:15:10,330 --> 00:15:11,740
Hamada, do you remember this?

468
00:15:11,890 --> 00:15:12,630
What? What?

469
00:15:12,710 --> 00:15:13,470
The back of this building.

470
00:15:13,640 --> 00:15:14,290
What back?

471
00:15:14,380 --> 00:15:15,220
Someone was living here, don't you remember?

472
00:15:15,220 --> 00:15:15,710
Ah! I remember!
Someone was living here, don't you remember?

473
00:15:15,710 --> 00:15:16,130
Ah! I remember!

474
00:15:16,270 --> 00:15:16,870
It was Nitta, right?

475
00:15:16,870 --> 00:15:18,470
-That's right!
-We came here with Gaki!

476
00:15:18,670 --> 00:15:19,290
We sure did.

477
00:15:19,290 --> 00:15:19,710
Right?

478
00:15:20,970 --> 00:15:24,690
We came and dumped everything, including his mattress.

479
00:15:27,180 --> 00:15:30,780
Next, the guys walk along Chazawa road towards The Suzunari.

480
00:15:33,340 --> 00:15:36,410
-There's tons of stuff around here as well!
-Right, all the plays at the Suzunari!

481
00:15:37,200 --> 00:15:39,310
The Suzunari side street has such a vibe.

482
00:15:39,630 --> 00:15:40,630
Look, it's so vintage.

483
00:15:40,630 --> 00:15:41,420
Should we really keep going forward?
There's nothing ahead, is there?
Look, it's so vintage.

484
00:15:41,420 --> 00:15:45,720
Should we really keep going forward?
There's nothing ahead, is there?

485
00:15:46,040 --> 00:15:48,410
-This area used to be a bit sketchy back then.
-Totally.

486
00:15:48,530 --> 00:15:50,430
This area wasn't too popular.

487
00:15:50,780 --> 00:15:52,820
And the railway crossing is now gone.

488
00:15:53,370 --> 00:15:54,300
-You're right, it's all gone.

489
00:15:54,300 --> 00:15:54,820
Yeah, this area used to be so great.
-You're right, it's all gone.

490
00:15:54,820 --> 00:15:56,370
Yeah, this area used to be so great.

491
00:15:56,530 --> 00:15:58,600
Whoa, I remember that bar!

492
00:15:58,600 --> 00:16:02,130
The manager of that store gave me a kiss on the forehead when I was working part-time.

493
00:16:02,200 --> 00:16:02,770
What the heck is that?

494
00:16:02,770 --> 00:16:03,400
Was it a woman?
What the heck is that?

495
00:16:03,400 --> 00:16:03,480
Was it a woman?

496
00:16:03,600 --> 00:16:05,320
No, a male manager.

497
00:16:05,430 --> 00:16:07,140
-Cause I was cute.
-Oh, really?

498
00:16:07,910 --> 00:16:09,860
You really used to be cute back then.

499
00:16:09,930 --> 00:16:10,640
Thank you.

500
00:16:10,950 --> 00:16:14,900
-But now you're quite repulsive.
-Repulsive?

501
00:16:15,030 --> 00:16:18,690
But you used to be really cute back then.

502
00:16:18,690 --> 00:16:19,900
Thank you.

503
00:16:20,510 --> 00:16:21,600
Totally.

504
00:16:22,490 --> 00:16:25,370
It's been 45 minutes since the start of their search!

505
00:16:26,480 --> 00:16:29,010
The guys have decided to take a break.

506
00:16:30,100 --> 00:16:32,720
I'll have an iced coffee.

507
00:16:32,720 --> 00:16:33,500
Iced coffee?

508
00:16:33,740 --> 00:16:35,040
Let's get 5 iced coffees.

509
00:16:37,870 --> 00:16:38,370
Why?

510
00:16:38,820 --> 00:16:40,610
I don't wanna drink ice coffee though...

511
00:16:41,160 --> 00:16:42,730
Everyone has their preferences.

512
00:16:43,570 --> 00:16:46,670
Just drink the damn ice coffee!
You guys are such a pain!

513
00:16:46,670 --> 00:16:46,820
Everyone has different tastes, right?
Just drink the damn ice coffee!
You guys are such a pain!

514
00:16:46,820 --> 00:16:48,260
Everyone has different tastes, right?

515
00:16:49,310 --> 00:16:50,310
I'll take a cafe latte.

516
00:16:50,410 --> 00:16:50,850
Cafe latte?

517
00:16:50,850 --> 00:16:51,600
Warm, please.

518
00:16:51,620 --> 00:16:52,330
Warm.

519
00:16:52,670 --> 00:16:53,900
Me too, I'll have a warm cafe latte as well.

520
00:16:53,900 --> 00:16:54,690
Where did you learn about a drink like that?
Me too, I'll have a warm cafe latte as well.

521
00:16:54,690 --> 00:16:56,090
Where did you learn about a drink like that?

522
00:16:57,500 --> 00:17:01,130
The guys get their drinks 5 minutes later.

523
00:17:03,710 --> 00:17:04,710
Three iced coffees.

524
00:17:05,290 --> 00:17:07,450
My drink is the easiest one to make, right?

525
00:17:07,450 --> 00:17:07,740
Yes, it's the easiest one. Thank you.
My drink is the easiest one to make, right?

526
00:17:07,740 --> 00:17:08,720
Yes, it's the easiest one. Thank you.

527
00:17:08,720 --> 00:17:09,680
That's right.
Yes, it's the easiest one. Thank you.

528
00:17:09,680 --> 00:17:10,210
That's right.

529
00:17:10,290 --> 00:17:13,730
You guys ordered all the most complicated drinks...

530
00:17:14,220 --> 00:17:19,370
Latte? Where did you learn that word?
You're from the most rural part of Amagaski, you doofus!

531
00:17:21,700 --> 00:17:23,060
"I'll take a latte", he says...

532
00:17:25,250 --> 00:17:29,130
Well, we're still looking around, right?

533
00:17:29,230 --> 00:17:30,700
Spotting someone while we sit here would feel so good.

534
00:17:30,700 --> 00:17:33,260
Right, and it would be great if it was someone from Yoshimoto.
Spotting someone while we sit here would feel so good.

535
00:17:33,260 --> 00:17:37,100
Right, and it would be great if it was someone from Yoshimoto.

536
00:17:37,220 --> 00:17:39,500
I'd love to meet Musashi right now.

537
00:17:42,100 --> 00:17:42,670
Wazzup!

538
00:17:43,580 --> 00:17:44,070
Wazzup!

539
00:17:44,500 --> 00:17:44,870
Wazzup!

540
00:17:45,300 --> 00:17:45,770
Wazzup!

541
00:17:45,800 --> 00:17:47,220
Oh, he replied!

542
00:17:47,870 --> 00:17:49,580
-Is he a boxer?
-You box?

543
00:17:49,580 --> 00:17:51,070
Yes, I'm a boxer.

544
00:17:51,120 --> 00:17:52,170
Whoa! Amazing!

545
00:17:54,990 --> 00:17:57,270
Kazuo Umezu's gotta be around here.

546
00:17:59,300 --> 00:18:00,400
In Shimokitazawa?

547
00:18:01,220 --> 00:18:03,400
He would stand out like a sore thumb.

548
00:18:03,860 --> 00:18:05,170
Right...

549
00:18:05,400 --> 00:18:06,540
Where is everyone?

550
00:18:06,930 --> 00:18:08,350
What about Jun Kaname?

551
00:18:08,380 --> 00:18:09,380
That'd be great.

552
00:18:10,180 --> 00:18:11,770
Jun Kaname would be perfect.

553
00:18:12,720 --> 00:18:14,230
Who would you like to meet, Endo?

554
00:18:16,730 --> 00:18:18,520
I'd like to find Naotaro Moriyama.

555
00:18:19,130 --> 00:18:20,440
He seems like the type to hang around here.

556
00:18:20,440 --> 00:18:21,530
Naotaro Moriyama.

557
00:18:22,200 --> 00:18:26,850
Were you fishing for laughs with that?

558
00:18:28,090 --> 00:18:29,770
I just thought it would be great.

559
00:18:30,430 --> 00:18:34,800
I figured he'd definitely hang around here, and I was also fishing for any laughs I could get.

560
00:18:35,510 --> 00:18:35,980
Ok.

561
00:18:35,980 --> 00:18:37,140
Was that good?

562
00:18:37,840 --> 00:18:38,570
Thanks.

563
00:18:40,720 --> 00:18:41,400
What about you Yamazaki?

564
00:18:41,400 --> 00:18:41,940
Saburo Tokito.
What about you Yamazaki?

565
00:18:41,940 --> 00:18:42,550
Saburo Tokito.

566
00:18:45,240 --> 00:18:47,180
You're just joking around now.

567
00:18:49,500 --> 00:18:50,990
He really went hard.

568
00:18:51,330 --> 00:18:53,060
But pros don't fall for those jokes.

569
00:18:54,570 --> 00:18:56,870
But who are we gonna meet, really.

570
00:18:57,730 --> 00:18:59,930
-For real now.
-For real?

571
00:18:59,960 --> 00:19:01,550
I mean, there's all kinds of people around here.

572
00:19:01,550 --> 00:19:02,950
Well, sure...

573
00:19:02,950 --> 00:19:03,770
Oh, there they go again.
Well, sure...

574
00:19:03,770 --> 00:19:04,600
Oh, there they go again.

575
00:19:05,340 --> 00:19:08,000
-Oh you're right, it's Chocolat.
-It's Chocolat again!

576
00:19:08,910 --> 00:19:12,220
We could have cleared the mission since everyone knows their name already.

577
00:19:13,050 --> 00:19:15,340
-Right?
-It would have counted.

578
00:19:15,870 --> 00:19:16,690
Let's go on three...

579
00:19:17,600 --> 00:19:19,140
-Chocolat.
-Chocolat.

580
00:19:19,250 --> 00:19:21,230
I feel like we could also meet some porn stars.

581
00:19:21,590 --> 00:19:22,770
No way.

582
00:19:23,360 --> 00:19:25,230
I wouldn't know any of them.

583
00:19:27,040 --> 00:19:27,830
I'd have no clue.

584
00:19:29,000 --> 00:19:30,770
Do you know any porn stars?

585
00:19:31,730 --> 00:19:36,120
I have absolutely no clue of who's doing what in the porn world.

586
00:19:36,310 --> 00:19:37,500
I mean, me either..

587
00:19:37,500 --> 00:19:38,100
Liar! You're the one that brought it up!
I mean, me either..

588
00:19:38,100 --> 00:19:39,100
Liar! You're the one that brought it up!

589
00:19:39,230 --> 00:19:42,650
I was just saying... It was just an example.

590
00:19:42,650 --> 00:19:43,210
Who? Who? Who?
I was just saying... It was just an example.

591
00:19:43,210 --> 00:19:43,650
Who? Who? Who?

592
00:19:44,210 --> 00:19:46,560
I don't know anyone past Toyomaru.

593
00:19:47,530 --> 00:19:48,930
That's like 30 years ago!

594
00:19:49,430 --> 00:19:51,180
-Toyomaru was popular 30 years ago!
-Toyomaru?

595
00:19:51,240 --> 00:19:53,330
That's the only one I know.

596
00:19:53,400 --> 00:19:54,810
Was she the one that lied?

597
00:19:55,290 --> 00:19:56,180
Or is that someone else?

598
00:19:56,700 --> 00:19:58,240
Wasn't that Kuroki...

599
00:19:58,570 --> 00:19:59,170
It's Hitomi!

600
00:19:59,330 --> 00:20:01,480
Kuroki was the one with the "armpits stank"... I meant the "armpit hair".

601
00:20:01,480 --> 00:20:02,540
They'll get mad at you.

602
00:20:03,010 --> 00:20:04,830
And what's with the "armpit stank"?

603
00:20:04,830 --> 00:20:06,000
-I was trying to say armpit hair.
-Right, hair!

604
00:20:06,530 --> 00:20:07,740
This is getting out of control.

605
00:20:10,060 --> 00:20:12,070
I was saying hair... Hair.

606
00:20:12,360 --> 00:20:13,000
It was Kaori.

607
00:20:14,620 --> 00:20:16,900
You mispronounced her name and then insulted her!

608
00:20:18,990 --> 00:20:20,890
You got everything wrong!

609
00:20:23,190 --> 00:20:24,420
What about that spot, Tanaka?

610
00:20:25,080 --> 00:20:28,430
The search resumes! And the guys head towards the train station.

611
00:20:28,690 --> 00:20:29,730
Over there.

612
00:20:29,880 --> 00:20:30,600
Was it there?

613
00:20:31,130 --> 00:20:34,930
I used to get drunk here.

614
00:20:34,930 --> 00:20:35,020
Right, there used to be a bar.
I used to get drunk here.

615
00:20:35,020 --> 00:20:35,930
Right, there used to be a bar.

616
00:20:36,720 --> 00:20:38,620
Matsumoto always brought us here.

617
00:20:38,630 --> 00:20:40,660
Tanaka, Yamazaki and I always hung out together, right?

618
00:20:40,660 --> 00:20:41,030
That's right.
Tanaka, Yamazaki and I always hung out together, right?

619
00:20:41,030 --> 00:20:41,970
That's right.

620
00:20:43,240 --> 00:20:43,520
Huh?

621
00:20:44,120 --> 00:20:45,270
This place is kinda nice, no?

622
00:20:45,520 --> 00:20:46,330
Yes!

623
00:20:46,370 --> 00:20:47,370
Isn't that Chad?

624
00:20:47,790 --> 00:20:48,200
No way.

625
00:20:48,370 --> 00:20:49,760
That's a woman.

626
00:20:49,760 --> 00:20:50,350
A woman?

627
00:20:50,390 --> 00:20:53,140
-It's a blonde girl.
-Running into Chad would have been great.

628
00:20:53,550 --> 00:20:56,070
Sure, sure...

629
00:20:58,960 --> 00:21:02,300
Is there a celebrity inside the store?

630
00:21:02,650 --> 00:21:03,770
There isn't...

631
00:21:04,110 --> 00:21:04,770
There's no one.

632
00:21:04,860 --> 00:21:06,920
They said Ryuhei Ueshima comes here often.

633
00:21:07,190 --> 00:21:07,870
Mr. Ryu?

634
00:21:08,010 --> 00:21:09,550
That would have been great.

635
00:21:09,830 --> 00:21:10,600
Mr. Ryu!

636
00:21:10,760 --> 00:21:13,160
Celebrities are amazing, right?

637
00:21:13,500 --> 00:21:15,200
They're everywhere.

638
00:21:15,250 --> 00:21:16,030
They sure are.

639
00:21:16,070 --> 00:21:17,230
They go around town.

640
00:21:17,840 --> 00:21:19,670
This place looks good.

641
00:21:22,060 --> 00:21:22,990
Let's eat some gyoza!

642
00:21:24,290 --> 00:21:26,700
You're really craving some gyoza today!

643
00:21:28,090 --> 00:21:29,990
I'm not really craving it...

644
00:21:30,430 --> 00:21:32,730
But you just have to eat gyoza, you know?
You guys piss me off.

645
00:21:36,290 --> 00:21:38,850
It's been 1 hour since the start of the search.

646
00:21:40,020 --> 00:21:40,500
Oh no...

647
00:21:41,980 --> 00:21:43,200
This might be bad.

648
00:21:44,440 --> 00:21:46,370
The guys are not finding anyone.

649
00:21:46,900 --> 00:21:48,830
A bad mood starts creeping in...

650
00:21:49,490 --> 00:21:50,830
What are we gonna do?

651
00:21:52,810 --> 00:21:54,560
There are less and less celebrity look-alikes.

652
00:21:54,690 --> 00:21:55,370
Yeah...

653
00:21:55,710 --> 00:21:57,870
What about her? She looks like a model.

654
00:21:58,120 --> 00:22:00,630
You were just about to go crazy, weren't you?

655
00:22:01,060 --> 00:22:03,010
They were just very excited and loud.

656
00:22:03,010 --> 00:22:03,270
I was looking at you, and you were about to burst out in laughter.
They were just very excited and loud.

657
00:22:03,270 --> 00:22:04,290
I was looking at you, and you were about to burst out in laughter.

658
00:22:04,340 --> 00:22:05,900
They were super loud.

659
00:22:07,960 --> 00:22:10,520
Have they finally found their celebrity?!

660
00:22:13,080 --> 00:22:15,830
When the guys were about to give up...

661
00:22:22,000 --> 00:22:23,120
I'm so happy!

662
00:22:24,390 --> 00:22:25,310
I'm so happy! Oh my god!

663
00:22:25,310 --> 00:22:26,020
Amazing!
I'm so happy! Oh my god!

664
00:22:26,020 --> 00:22:26,490
Amazing!

665
00:22:26,860 --> 00:22:27,550
What are you doing here?

666
00:22:27,790 --> 00:22:28,570
What are you doing here?

667
00:22:28,660 --> 00:22:30,690
What's up with this?

668
00:22:31,120 --> 00:22:32,660
That's so embarrassing!

669
00:22:32,970 --> 00:22:35,500
Right?
I mean, that's so embarrassing!

670
00:22:36,150 --> 00:22:38,230
This is a bit too much!

671
00:22:38,560 --> 00:22:41,250
There's something weird going on here!

672
00:22:43,420 --> 00:22:44,570
I am just heading to a concert.

673
00:22:44,760 --> 00:22:45,630
Where? Where?

674
00:22:45,670 --> 00:22:47,800
Over there, that building.

675
00:22:47,850 --> 00:22:49,570
-There?
-Yes.

676
00:22:50,190 --> 00:22:52,110
That's such a typical Shimokitazawa venue!

677
00:22:52,110 --> 00:22:52,300
We really met one of our guys!
That's such a typical Shimokitazawa venue!

678
00:22:52,300 --> 00:22:54,900
We really met one of our guys!

679
00:22:55,920 --> 00:22:57,490
This is amazing!

680
00:22:57,490 --> 00:22:57,570
So, are we done?
This is amazing!

681
00:22:57,570 --> 00:22:58,430
So, are we done?

682
00:22:58,750 --> 00:23:00,330
-Of course!
-He's a celebrity!

683
00:23:01,020 --> 00:23:02,700
Let's say his name first.

684
00:23:03,490 --> 00:23:06,700
One... Two... Yoshi from Cowcow!

685
00:23:07,320 --> 00:23:08,100
Thank you.

686
00:23:08,130 --> 00:23:12,390
I mean, I had this idea of finding someone stylish walking around the streets of Shimokitazawa...

687
00:23:12,860 --> 00:23:14,700
But then you came in rattling this thing around!

688
00:23:15,580 --> 00:23:16,390
What the heck is this thing?

689
00:23:17,620 --> 00:23:18,210
What is it, really?

690
00:23:18,210 --> 00:23:18,370
Really, what is it?
What is it, really?

691
00:23:18,370 --> 00:23:19,400
Really, what is it?

692
00:23:19,490 --> 00:23:21,860
An unfinished poster?

693
00:23:22,080 --> 00:23:23,680
You're going to a concert, right?

694
00:23:23,880 --> 00:23:26,090
Yes, it's for the 50th anniversary of this meat restaurant.

695
00:23:26,090 --> 00:23:26,670
Oh, is that so?
Yes, it's for the 50th anniversary of this meat restaurant.

696
00:23:26,670 --> 00:23:27,970
Oh, is that so?

697
00:23:28,790 --> 00:23:30,700
Then we're done, right?

698
00:23:31,510 --> 00:23:33,230
Right, we're done.

699
00:23:33,590 --> 00:23:34,980
What's with everyone's lukewarm mood?

700
00:23:36,050 --> 00:23:37,800
I mean, we see him all the time.

701
00:23:39,200 --> 00:23:40,110
How anticlimactic...

702
00:23:40,110 --> 00:23:40,490
What the heck...
How anticlimactic...

703
00:23:40,490 --> 00:23:41,430
What the heck...

704
00:23:41,730 --> 00:23:43,640
You look almost pissed off at me.

705
00:23:44,390 --> 00:23:45,780
You're about to explode!

706
00:23:45,820 --> 00:23:47,580
I mean...

707
00:23:47,690 --> 00:23:50,950
It's like opening your fridge and seeing eggs...

708
00:23:51,620 --> 00:23:53,270
Like, "It's just eggs...".

709
00:23:54,050 --> 00:23:55,870
"Eggs, huh..."

710
00:23:59,820 --> 00:24:01,000
Right, right.

711
00:24:01,420 --> 00:24:02,910
Totally.

712
00:24:03,380 --> 00:24:05,400
That was crazy.

713
00:24:06,210 --> 00:24:07,230
Thank you!
