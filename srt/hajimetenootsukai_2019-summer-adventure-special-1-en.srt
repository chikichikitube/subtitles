1
00:00:02,720 --> 00:00:08,420
My first errand. Summer adventure special.

2
00:00:12,420 --> 00:00:17,830
In the Seto Inland Sea we find the second biggest island next to Awaji island

3
00:00:17,820 --> 00:00:21,020
the first errand will take place on Shōdo island.

4
00:00:21,020 --> 00:00:27,400
The film "Twenty-four eyes" takes place here.

5
00:00:27,400 --> 00:00:34,530
Since they made the film there they've opened up the filmset for tourists to visit.

6
00:00:34,520 --> 00:00:38,690
This will be the goal for the first errand.

7
00:00:38,680 --> 00:00:43,760
It's about a young female teacher and 12 first-year students

8
00:00:43,760 --> 00:00:48,040
and how she reaches the hearts of those students.

9
00:00:57,560 --> 00:01:07,260
The teacher would ride her bicycle all the way round the sea shore and through the town to school on the opposite side.

10
00:01:07,440 --> 00:01:13,210
That the errand would follow a similar objective was conceived by the father.

11
00:01:12,500 --> 00:01:20,220
Kairi
3 years old

12
00:01:13,280 --> 00:01:17,140
With the 3 year old Kairi who can greet people with a confident voice.

13
00:01:17,140 --> 00:01:22,440
He can also hand customers their voucher.
"He can do the errand if it's in the movie set" is what his dad said.

14
00:01:22,440 --> 00:01:25,980
But as expected he can't go by bicycle.

15
00:01:24,880 --> 00:01:26,440
He still can't ride one.

16
00:01:26,020 --> 00:01:31,440
Since it takes 30 minutes with the bus how would he get there is what the father worried about.

17
00:01:31,450 --> 00:01:34,520
But they found a clue in the movie.

18
00:01:43,860 --> 00:01:47,350
When the teacher hurt herself she returned to the town by boat.

19
00:01:47,340 --> 00:01:55,720
The exact same route as the teacher sailed is open every spring holiday.

20
00:01:57,380 --> 00:02:00,900
The sailing time is merely 10 minutes.

21
00:02:00,900 --> 00:02:08,240
Kairi's first errand will fall on the second week of April on a Thursday.

22
00:02:05,520 --> 00:02:08,240
Wonder if he can do it by himself.

23
00:02:08,240 --> 00:02:14,820
And now finally it's that morning. Kairi's mother will ask him to help out with an errand.

24
00:02:14,820 --> 00:02:18,700
Can you help me with cleaning?
Open the sliding doors.

25
00:02:18,700 --> 00:02:25,720
Before putting him to the task his mother wants to put him a "helping mode" first.

26
00:02:25,730 --> 00:02:31,400
It's not going too well.

27
00:02:25,730 --> 00:02:31,400
Oh, it nice.

28
00:02:31,400 --> 00:02:37,160
Next up wipe the table. Yes, that's it.
You are really helpful.

29
00:02:37,160 --> 00:02:43,740
Is he really helpful? It seems like there is no chance of him going on an errand.

30
00:02:42,620 --> 00:02:43,940
No motivation.

31
00:02:43,780 --> 00:02:48,310
At that time a phone call from the father.

32
00:02:48,300 --> 00:02:53,160
Hello.
I forgot the sales vouchers.
What?

33
00:02:53,160 --> 00:02:55,740
He uses these vouchers to hand out to people.

34
00:02:55,740 --> 00:02:56,960
Kairi, come over here.

35
00:02:56,960 --> 00:03:03,180
Kairi often goes with his father on deliveries so he knows about the blue voucher book.

36
00:03:03,170 --> 00:03:07,160
Where is it?

37
00:03:03,170 --> 00:03:08,400
It was in a very easy place to find.

38
00:03:08,400 --> 00:03:11,980
- Kairi?
- Yup? Yup?

39
00:03:11,980 --> 00:03:15,140
- I have to use it for a delivery.
- Yup.

40
00:03:15,140 --> 00:03:17,760
I will need this when I go to the film set village.

41
00:03:17,760 --> 00:03:22,850
This voucher book is needed for when he goes to the film set village.

42
00:03:22,840 --> 00:03:26,680
- What will you do?
- I will bring it?

43
00:03:26,680 --> 00:03:31,130
Even if he says that his finger is still inside his mouth.

44
00:03:31,120 --> 00:03:33,510
Remember that I made an apron for you.

45
00:03:33,500 --> 00:03:34,420
An apron?

46
00:03:34,420 --> 00:03:35,900
Yeah, I made an apron for you.

47
00:03:36,200 --> 00:03:39,280
When his father makes deliveries he also wears an apron.

48
00:03:39,280 --> 00:03:41,990
I made it for when Kairi goes on deliveries.

49
00:03:41,980 --> 00:03:46,100
He made this apron so that Kairi could look up to his father.

50
00:03:46,100 --> 00:03:47,440
Come here.

51
00:03:47,440 --> 00:03:50,340
Benten Circle. The shop's name is written on it.

52
00:03:50,340 --> 00:03:54,730
- Kairi, can you wear it and drop by?
- Yup.

53
00:03:54,720 --> 00:03:56,660
Okay then. Do your best.

54
00:03:56,660 --> 00:03:59,980
Even though he's supposed to be stoked about the task.

55
00:03:59,980 --> 00:04:02,140
- I will be waiting for you.
- Yup.

56
00:04:02,140 --> 00:04:03,600
Okay.

57
00:04:03,600 --> 00:04:06,070
Not a strong response from him.

58
00:04:06,940 --> 00:04:08,500
I wonder if he will be okay.

59
00:04:11,020 --> 00:04:14,030
It's 700 m. from the house to the boat boarding dock.

60
00:04:14,020 --> 00:04:19,260
He will then deliver the vouchers to his father waiting in the village.

61
00:04:19,260 --> 00:04:20,130
High five!

62
00:04:20,120 --> 00:04:22,130
Is he excited about going now?

63
00:04:22,120 --> 00:04:23,450
High five.

64
00:04:22,560 --> 00:04:25,250
Amazing.

65
00:04:28,520 --> 00:04:31,460
Maybe not after all.

66
00:04:31,460 --> 00:04:33,140
He stopped.

67
00:04:34,300 --> 00:04:38,310
His sister cheered with her support.

68
00:04:36,100 --> 00:04:38,210
She said "do your best!"

69
00:04:41,320 --> 00:04:44,310
Wonder if the feeling reached to him.

70
00:04:44,790 --> 00:04:47,340
He started moving faster.

71
00:04:47,380 --> 00:04:49,980
Remember that the shop is called Benten.

72
00:04:52,800 --> 00:04:54,140
Blue Line!!!

73
00:04:54,140 --> 00:04:56,690
Blue Line?

74
00:04:56,680 --> 00:05:00,020
- Mom, there is a blue line.
- Really?

75
00:05:00,020 --> 00:05:01,550
What?

76
00:05:01,540 --> 00:05:04,780
See! Blue Line has come.

77
00:05:04,780 --> 00:05:09,740
Blue line is the ferry that connects Shōdo island with Takamatsu.

78
00:05:11,580 --> 00:05:16,530
Rather than being excited about helping his father he's excited about seeing the jumbo ferry.

79
00:05:16,520 --> 00:05:19,320
Be safe.

80
00:05:16,520 --> 00:05:19,320
Okay.

81
00:05:22,100 --> 00:05:28,020
Blue Line. Bye bye and I will ride you once again, okay?

82
00:05:28,020 --> 00:05:33,830
He suddenly changed into the usual big brother with a loud voice.

83
00:05:33,820 --> 00:05:37,020
Kairi loves huge things.

84
00:05:37,020 --> 00:05:38,290
Bus.

85
00:05:38,280 --> 00:05:40,110
And of course he also loves busses.

86
00:05:40,100 --> 00:05:45,170
Carp streamers.
Carp streamers.

87
00:05:45,160 --> 00:05:49,930
They are big. Just like that dog.

88
00:05:51,080 --> 00:05:53,710
What?

89
00:05:54,120 --> 00:05:58,820
Ah, a real one is there.
But it's in a cage.

90
00:05:58,620 --> 00:06:00,840
It's fine. It's fine.

91
00:06:03,540 --> 00:06:08,130
Even if it's that far away.

92
00:06:08,120 --> 00:06:11,530
Ah, he sat down.

93
00:06:11,520 --> 00:06:14,530
He's in trouble.

94
00:06:22,320 --> 00:06:27,150
He can't move.
But at that moment...

95
00:06:27,140 --> 00:06:30,870
An old lady came out and started talking to him.

96
00:06:30,860 --> 00:06:33,570
What's wrong?

97
00:06:33,560 --> 00:06:34,760
A dog.

98
00:06:34,760 --> 00:06:36,820
Do you like dogs?

99
00:06:34,760 --> 00:06:36,820
I hate them.

100
00:06:36,820 --> 00:06:41,070
You don't like them? Want me to walk down the street with you?

101
00:06:41,940 --> 00:06:44,310
Want to go? Okay then, let's go.

102
00:06:44,300 --> 00:06:47,630
Phew, what a help.

103
00:06:47,920 --> 00:06:50,100
Are you okay with dogs?

104
00:06:49,320 --> 00:06:50,100
I hate them.

105
00:06:51,060 --> 00:06:53,950
Cats. If only it was a cat.

106
00:06:51,060 --> 00:06:53,950
Oh, so you like cats?

107
00:06:55,300 --> 00:06:56,710
Bye bye.

108
00:06:56,700 --> 00:07:00,310
Even if it scares him he makes sure to greet it properly.

109
00:07:00,300 --> 00:07:04,590
His mother has made a flag that says: "I will cross".

110
00:07:04,580 --> 00:07:07,710
The boat boarding station is on the other side of the road.

111
00:07:07,700 --> 00:07:12,890
It takes about 10 minutes to the film set village.

112
00:07:14,400 --> 00:07:20,820
The boarding stop is located at
olive beach which is 700 meters broad.

113
00:07:20,820 --> 00:07:25,790
Marine sports in the Seto Inland Sea take place here.

114
00:07:25,780 --> 00:07:33,670
Going left here and he will be at the boarding stop. Seems like he knows the location.

115
00:07:36,180 --> 00:07:39,840
Wait, what's up with his facial expression?

116
00:07:39,840 --> 00:07:43,590
It has departed.

117
00:07:43,580 --> 00:07:46,460
It's departing.

118
00:07:44,200 --> 00:07:46,310
- No way.
- Why?

119
00:07:47,140 --> 00:07:50,550
The boat is leaving.

120
00:07:50,540 --> 00:07:53,990
It was requested to go the film set village.

121
00:07:53,980 --> 00:07:58,270
While it takes 10 minutes each way it takes time for the tourists to board.

122
00:07:58,260 --> 00:08:01,410
So it won't be heading back until after 15 minutes.

123
00:08:00,280 --> 00:08:01,410
I see.

124
00:08:01,400 --> 00:08:02,390
It has departed.

125
00:08:02,900 --> 00:08:07,590
The harshness of the ocean as well as its kindness the 3 year old man who knows this well...

126
00:08:07,580 --> 00:08:10,110
Kairi!

127
00:08:08,700 --> 00:08:10,630
- So cool.
- Cool.

128
00:08:11,740 --> 00:08:15,010
Blue Line!

129
00:08:16,080 --> 00:08:18,490
Blue Line!

130
00:08:18,480 --> 00:08:26,470
Just like his father wanted. A confident boy who loves the ocean and its ships.

131
00:08:26,460 --> 00:08:30,330
Shōdo island where both the ocean and the mountains are near

132
00:08:30,320 --> 00:08:36,430
and where the temperature is closer to that of Spain or Italy.

133
00:08:36,420 --> 00:08:40,070
In this island famed for its handmade soy sauce and sōmen noodles

134
00:08:40,060 --> 00:08:43,630
it also produces the most amount of olives in Japan.

135
00:08:43,620 --> 00:08:48,630
This is what charms the tourists who visit the island.

136
00:08:48,620 --> 00:08:49,950
Anpan...

137
00:08:49,940 --> 00:08:55,370
No matter how loud his singing is
it bothers no one.

138
00:08:58,860 --> 00:09:00,650
Is it coming?

139
00:09:00,640 --> 00:09:03,550
It's coming. It's coming.

140
00:09:03,540 --> 00:09:05,330
The boat is coming back.

141
00:09:05,320 --> 00:09:07,430
Welcome back.

142
00:09:07,420 --> 00:09:13,190
Yahoo!
It came, it came!

143
00:09:09,260 --> 00:09:11,770
- What an energetic kid.
- He's great.

144
00:09:15,500 --> 00:09:17,570
Hello.

145
00:09:17,240 --> 00:09:19,030
Amazing kid.

146
00:09:17,580 --> 00:09:21,450
Yes, just as he has been asked to.
Greeting people with a confident voice.

147
00:09:21,440 --> 00:09:24,050
The usual fare is 500 yen.

148
00:09:24,040 --> 00:09:31,370
But if he tells them he wants to go to Benten Circle only for today it will be free to ride.

149
00:09:31,360 --> 00:09:34,330
I wish to go to Benten Circle.

150
00:09:33,980 --> 00:09:35,630
Ah, he said it.

151
00:09:34,680 --> 00:09:35,630
What?

152
00:09:36,220 --> 00:09:38,570
To Benten Circle, please.

153
00:09:36,220 --> 00:09:38,570
Yes, I understand.

154
00:09:38,560 --> 00:09:41,370
I came to deliver something.

155
00:09:38,560 --> 00:09:41,370
I understand.

156
00:09:41,360 --> 00:09:42,930
He was able to say it.

157
00:09:42,920 --> 00:09:47,830
Since there are no other customers he was allowed to sit in the special seats.

158
00:09:47,540 --> 00:09:49,150
How lucky.

159
00:09:49,140 --> 00:09:51,170
Bye bye.

160
00:09:57,820 --> 00:10:01,530
The weather is so fine today and there's no wind.

161
00:10:01,520 --> 00:10:07,570
The small boat is floating on top of the ocean that is clear as a mirror and heads towards the coast.

162
00:10:07,300 --> 00:10:09,910
What an amazing view.

163
00:10:10,360 --> 00:10:14,310
- What a nice expression.
- That's the best.

164
00:10:19,160 --> 00:10:24,150
Within 10 minutes and they can finally see the film set village.

165
00:10:24,540 --> 00:10:26,470
Carry me please.

166
00:10:27,240 --> 00:10:31,370
He is able to properly ask for help.
His height is only 91 cm.

167
00:10:31,360 --> 00:10:35,090
He noticed that he forgot something.

168
00:10:36,060 --> 00:10:38,950
Old man. Thank you very much.

169
00:10:38,940 --> 00:10:41,790
That's right. He forgot to thank him.

170
00:10:39,180 --> 00:10:40,770
Such a good boy.

171
00:10:41,800 --> 00:10:47,450
Thank you.

172
00:10:43,800 --> 00:10:47,450
Thank you.

173
00:10:48,000 --> 00:10:50,590
I crossed.

174
00:10:51,280 --> 00:10:55,310
This is the film set village for "Twenty-Four Eyes".

175
00:10:57,560 --> 00:10:59,470
I came to deliver something.

176
00:10:59,460 --> 00:11:02,010
Hello.

177
00:10:59,460 --> 00:11:02,010
Hello.

178
00:11:02,000 --> 00:11:06,350
Since he came to deliver something
there won't be any entrance fee.

179
00:11:06,340 --> 00:11:15,690
This is the set that director of the color remake: Asama Yoshitaka used for the film.

180
00:11:15,680 --> 00:11:18,030
I wonder where dad is.

181
00:11:18,020 --> 00:11:24,170
The place that the father is always at is at a restaurant in a gallery called Kinema cuisine.

182
00:11:24,160 --> 00:11:27,980
The father delivers rice and vegetables to this place.

183
00:11:28,500 --> 00:11:31,900
The father is supposedly in
the warehouse furthest away.

184
00:11:31,890 --> 00:11:34,010
The cameraman went on ahead.

185
00:11:35,100 --> 00:11:37,190
Ah, found him.

186
00:11:38,360 --> 00:11:41,170
He knows that Kairi has arrived on the address.

187
00:11:41,160 --> 00:11:46,750
Put his father plans on not coming out until his son calls him in a confident voice.

188
00:11:45,340 --> 00:11:47,900
He's just pretending to be doing something.

189
00:11:49,740 --> 00:11:52,950
He has to say: "This is a delivery".

190
00:11:53,970 --> 00:11:55,780
But he says nothing.

191
00:11:55,770 --> 00:12:00,650
Erika and Minami who always give
him candy are right there.

192
00:12:00,640 --> 00:12:03,310
Not here. He's not here.

193
00:12:03,300 --> 00:12:05,030
Isn't he going to go in?

194
00:12:05,020 --> 00:12:08,870
He wasn't there. I will go over there and see.

195
00:12:08,860 --> 00:12:10,870
- He could've just called for him.
- Yup.

196
00:12:10,860 --> 00:12:13,580
He will look for him elsewhere.

197
00:12:15,410 --> 00:12:17,390
Seems like he knows where else to look.

198
00:12:17,480 --> 00:12:21,930
But this place is instead where the gallery is.

199
00:12:21,920 --> 00:12:27,870
He's looking for his father there.
But his father is always back at that kitchen.

200
00:12:30,900 --> 00:12:32,710
What's that sound?

201
00:12:38,770 --> 00:12:42,460
He's totally not looking for him.

202
00:12:42,450 --> 00:12:44,500
Hey you, what did you come here to do?

203
00:12:44,490 --> 00:12:47,160
Huh? I came here to play.

204
00:12:46,700 --> 00:12:48,710
Oh really?

205
00:12:48,920 --> 00:12:50,290
He forgot.

206
00:12:49,850 --> 00:12:53,430
I will go and see if there are any fish.

207
00:12:53,420 --> 00:12:59,100
He just passed the restaurant again and went straight to check up on his friends.

208
00:12:59,650 --> 00:13:01,210
Ah, he went to look at the fish.

209
00:13:00,400 --> 00:13:01,710
Kobuchan.

210
00:13:01,700 --> 00:13:02,170
Kobuchan?

211
00:13:02,160 --> 00:13:08,830
He calls Asian sheepshead wrasse for kobuchan.
The endearing nickname he uses while feeding them.

212
00:13:08,820 --> 00:13:12,730
What? Kobuchan aren't coming at all. Oh!

213
00:13:12,720 --> 00:13:14,350
What's up?

214
00:13:14,340 --> 00:13:16,420
Kobuchan.

215
00:13:16,410 --> 00:13:20,780
Meanwhile his father who has
nothing better to do but to wait.

216
00:13:21,080 --> 00:13:22,970
Like he is looking for something.

217
00:13:23,720 --> 00:13:27,940
Kobuchan. Oh, it went over there.

218
00:13:27,930 --> 00:13:31,370
The fish just doesn't let him approach them today.

219
00:13:35,240 --> 00:13:37,620
I will also check if dad is there.

220
00:13:37,610 --> 00:13:39,470
He finally remembered.

221
00:13:38,050 --> 00:13:41,990
He has played enough for today.
But he came here because of the errand.

222
00:13:41,980 --> 00:13:45,790
He returned to the restaurant his father is in.

223
00:13:46,400 --> 00:13:48,620
I came to deliver something.

224
00:13:49,840 --> 00:13:52,810
It's for Benten Circle.

225
00:13:52,920 --> 00:13:55,810
He can finally hear Kairi's voice.

226
00:13:55,800 --> 00:13:57,030
Finally.

227
00:13:57,020 --> 00:13:59,860
I came here for a delivery.

228
00:13:59,930 --> 00:14:02,970
Kairi, did you come by yourself?

229
00:14:01,860 --> 00:14:02,970
Yup.

230
00:14:04,320 --> 00:14:06,830
Thank you.

231
00:14:04,320 --> 00:14:06,830
You forgot this thing.

232
00:14:06,820 --> 00:14:08,670
The crucial voucher book.

233
00:14:08,130 --> 00:14:09,540
He's so well raised.

234
00:14:08,620 --> 00:14:10,420
Thank you.

235
00:14:10,410 --> 00:14:11,930
You really helped me out.

236
00:14:11,920 --> 00:14:15,210
Since you did so well.
Why don't you feed the fish?

237
00:14:15,780 --> 00:14:19,370
Feed for the fish.
Hey, the sheepshead wrasse are coming.

238
00:14:19,360 --> 00:14:21,010
How amazing.

239
00:14:22,250 --> 00:14:25,390
It gulped it down.

240
00:14:25,380 --> 00:14:28,690
If you don't feed them then they won't come to you, huh?

241
00:14:28,680 --> 00:14:30,980
Kobuchan.

242
00:14:30,970 --> 00:14:34,180
The unchanging blue-green ocean

243
00:14:34,170 --> 00:14:36,740
and at the foot of the mountain.

244
00:14:36,730 --> 00:14:41,390
There are still 3 years until
Kairi begins elementary school.

245
00:14:43,090 --> 00:14:45,810
I feel so proud.

246
00:14:46,280 --> 00:14:48,370
I feel so proud.

247
00:14:48,360 --> 00:14:50,740
Yeah, the world of movies.

248
00:14:50,730 --> 00:14:52,090
That's why I felt proud.

249
00:14:52,600 --> 00:14:56,630
- Amazing that a 3 year old kid is riding a boat by himself.
- Yes it is.

250
00:14:56,650 --> 00:15:01,790
And the way he thanked the old man in sunglasses.

251
00:15:01,770 --> 00:15:05,730
And when he was sitting there he expressed such satisfaction.

252
00:15:05,650 --> 00:15:08,930
And somebody in the studio even cried during that scene.

253
00:15:08,920 --> 00:15:12,430
Remembering when I was that age
and trying my best

254
00:15:12,420 --> 00:15:16,490
and when he clearly answered "I came here to play".

255
00:15:16,480 --> 00:15:21,530
When going outside by yourself
for the first time it can be quite scary

256
00:15:21,520 --> 00:15:31,260
and there all these excitements and unknowns.
It made me think of when I was a child.

257
00:15:31,250 --> 00:15:36,690
And this time Sugiyama has also
put her child out on their first errand.

258
00:15:36,680 --> 00:15:38,950
Yes, I did indeed.

259
00:15:39,810 --> 00:15:41,590
How do you feel right now?

260
00:15:41,580 --> 00:15:45,970
I feel nervous and all kinds of weird feelings are mixed in while watching this.

261
00:15:45,960 --> 00:15:49,870
There are worries such as whether they can succeed or not.

262
00:15:49,860 --> 00:15:51,990
Indeed, it's very exciting to watch.

263
00:15:51,980 --> 00:15:55,660
We look forward to see your kids first errand later on.

264
00:15:55,650 --> 00:16:00,180
Sugiyama family's first errand.

265
00:16:12,380 --> 00:16:16,530
Tomiura is located in Chiba prefecture (Town of Minamibōsō).

266
00:16:16,520 --> 00:16:19,710
It's where we can find the father-daughter couple.

267
00:16:19,700 --> 00:16:23,350
The cool daughter who loves her father.

268
00:16:23,340 --> 00:16:26,500
Koiki who is 3 years and 9 months old.

269
00:16:25,480 --> 00:16:26,940
So cute.

270
00:16:26,220 --> 00:16:37,290
Jinsei

271
00:16:26,930 --> 00:16:31,870
The day her little brother - Doushi - was born she turned into a big sister overnight.

272
00:16:31,860 --> 00:16:37,750
"I love my father" is what she's been saying a lot lately.

273
00:16:37,740 --> 00:16:41,830
She will go on an errand for her father.

274
00:16:41,820 --> 00:16:46,530
Those are dad's legs and his hands.

275
00:16:50,720 --> 00:16:53,450
What about a kiss?

276
00:16:51,480 --> 00:16:54,820
Eh?

277
00:16:54,810 --> 00:16:57,340
Won't do it, ha!

278
00:16:57,330 --> 00:16:59,130
What are they doing?

279
00:16:59,120 --> 00:17:01,550
They have a great relationship.

280
00:16:59,200 --> 00:17:02,660
Will you do it?

281
00:17:02,650 --> 00:17:06,660
As the mother told us.
The two of them are always like this.

282
00:17:06,650 --> 00:17:10,340
Rather than father and daughter
they behave like a couple.

283
00:17:10,330 --> 00:17:11,820
How nice.

284
00:17:11,810 --> 00:17:15,730
The house her father grew up in is nearby.
It's a guest house.

285
00:17:15,720 --> 00:17:23,390
Every morning the grandfather gets the fresh fish and prepares them for his customers.

286
00:17:24,640 --> 00:17:27,300
Mom, what can I help you with?

287
00:17:27,290 --> 00:17:29,260
What a good kid.

288
00:17:29,250 --> 00:17:31,690
I will.

289
00:17:29,250 --> 00:17:31,690
Won't you help out with this?

290
00:17:31,680 --> 00:17:36,550
The truth is that since a couple of days they've been training Koiki to help out.

291
00:17:36,540 --> 00:17:39,410
Today she will do whatever they tell her to do.

292
00:17:39,400 --> 00:17:41,140
Alright. I will go now.

293
00:17:41,130 --> 00:17:45,430
Father will go with grandpa to collect the recent catches.

294
00:17:45,420 --> 00:17:47,060
- Take care.
- Off I go.

295
00:17:47,200 --> 00:17:50,740
He always enjoys the bento that his wife makes for lunch.

296
00:17:50,730 --> 00:17:55,070
But this time he has forgotten it on purpose.

297
00:17:56,380 --> 00:17:57,860
Whose this?

298
00:17:57,850 --> 00:18:00,020
An onigiri bento.

299
00:18:00,010 --> 00:18:01,540
Is it dad's?

300
00:18:01,530 --> 00:18:04,220
Koiki immediately noticed it.

301
00:18:03,000 --> 00:18:04,230
That was quick.

302
00:18:04,220 --> 00:18:06,550
Is he still there?

303
00:18:06,540 --> 00:18:09,270
Father, hurry. Hurry.

304
00:18:08,330 --> 00:18:09,430
Hurry out.

305
00:18:09,420 --> 00:18:11,410
Daddy.

306
00:18:11,400 --> 00:18:12,690
Close call.

307
00:18:12,680 --> 00:18:15,140
He barely managed to escape.

308
00:18:13,690 --> 00:18:15,110
He left.

309
00:18:15,130 --> 00:18:16,860
This will be the errand.

310
00:18:16,850 --> 00:18:20,060
He left, Koiki.
What will we do?

311
00:18:17,800 --> 00:18:19,530
She's so dejected.

312
00:18:20,050 --> 00:18:24,770
I can't leave the house because of the electrician coming.

313
00:18:24,760 --> 00:18:28,490
What will they do?

314
00:18:26,340 --> 00:18:27,980
She's spinning.

315
00:18:28,480 --> 00:18:30,270
Where did dad go?

316
00:18:30,260 --> 00:18:32,100
To work.

317
00:18:33,280 --> 00:18:36,530
She knows that he left for the harbor.

318
00:18:37,260 --> 00:18:42,780
Grandfathers boat is waiting 2 km away from their house.

319
00:18:42,770 --> 00:18:47,150
It returns here for lunch.

320
00:18:47,140 --> 00:18:49,110
Can I ask you for help?

321
00:18:51,000 --> 00:18:52,870
For my first errand?

322
00:18:52,860 --> 00:18:55,130
Did she figure out it's for the show?

323
00:18:55,720 --> 00:18:57,730
No no no, that's not it.

324
00:18:57,720 --> 00:18:58,820
Can you go?

325
00:18:58,810 --> 00:19:07,490
Last month everyone in the neighborhood was praising her big brother saying: "Wow, you were able to go on your first errand".

326
00:19:07,960 --> 00:19:14,470
Next up, I (Koiki) will go.
It's a true "first errand" fad.

327
00:19:14,940 --> 00:19:20,810
But there's one puzzling thing
in regards to Koiki's first errand.

328
00:19:20,800 --> 00:19:26,290
Her mother has given her a good luck charm with words of love.

329
00:19:27,200 --> 00:19:32,190
Pipi? (sounds of weeping)
It's because Koiki tends to cry very easily.

330
00:19:34,840 --> 00:19:43,110
As soon as things don't go her way she will start weeping.

331
00:19:43,100 --> 00:19:48,110
That's why her dad and her made their own word.

332
00:19:48,100 --> 00:19:51,750
Koiki, pipi.

333
00:19:52,810 --> 00:19:54,870
I will not cry.

334
00:19:54,860 --> 00:19:56,050
Are you a baby?

335
00:19:56,040 --> 00:19:57,550
I'm not.

336
00:19:57,540 --> 00:20:00,380
I won't cry.

337
00:19:57,540 --> 00:20:00,380
Pipi.

338
00:20:00,370 --> 00:20:02,650
She doesn't want to be called a baby.

339
00:20:02,640 --> 00:20:05,100
She wants to be seen as a big sister.

340
00:20:06,800 --> 00:20:09,010
Yes.

341
00:20:06,800 --> 00:20:09,010
You're a big sister.

342
00:20:19,500 --> 00:20:23,330
What does it say here?
It's the word we use every time you cry.

343
00:20:23,320 --> 00:20:26,580
Pipi, I will not cry.

344
00:20:26,570 --> 00:20:29,980
If you cry just look at this good luck charm, okay?

345
00:20:29,970 --> 00:20:34,190
Just look at this and give it all you got. Can you do it?

346
00:20:34,180 --> 00:20:37,970
All right, stand up. I will put it on you.

347
00:20:37,960 --> 00:20:40,850
She will be fine if she's got this charm.

348
00:20:40,840 --> 00:20:42,410
Can you do it?

349
00:20:42,400 --> 00:20:44,300
I wonder...

350
00:20:45,180 --> 00:20:48,020
Aiming for the coast

351
00:20:48,010 --> 00:20:52,550
her father will return to the harbor around noon for lunch.

352
00:20:53,820 --> 00:20:56,510
I'm off.

353
00:20:53,820 --> 00:20:56,510
Take care.

354
00:20:57,290 --> 00:21:00,200
I'm off.

355
00:20:57,290 --> 00:21:00,200
Take care.

356
00:21:01,250 --> 00:21:05,190
Today she departed the house without crying all pipi-like.

357
00:21:05,930 --> 00:21:06,910
How remarkable.

358
00:21:08,490 --> 00:21:11,390
Just as she promised her dad who she loves

359
00:21:11,380 --> 00:21:13,010
I won't cry anymore.

360
00:21:13,000 --> 00:21:20,860
Song lyrics: She has started walking with a charm in her chest that her mother put on her...

361
00:21:20,930 --> 00:21:24,810
She uses all her strength to head for the harbor.

362
00:21:25,740 --> 00:21:27,010
She's so strong.

363
00:21:29,500 --> 00:21:32,980
- You are so cute.
- Hello there.

364
00:21:32,980 --> 00:21:36,580
There's no time for the abundance of greetings.

365
00:21:40,800 --> 00:21:43,230
Even though it's a street without a crossing

366
00:21:43,220 --> 00:21:47,190
since she's a big sister she knows how to properly cross a street.

367
00:21:45,730 --> 00:21:47,190
How great.

368
00:21:51,970 --> 00:21:55,620
It's almost lunch. I wonder if the boat is about to return.

369
00:21:57,440 --> 00:21:59,870
Yes, it's over there.

370
00:22:01,010 --> 00:22:04,870
The boat is returning to the harbor.

371
00:22:03,490 --> 00:22:04,980
Thankfully.

372
00:22:04,300 --> 00:22:09,920
Original song:
By Keiko Utoku · Shingo Maekawa
The loving words from the jet of a voice

373
00:22:06,970 --> 00:22:13,380
They've already caught lots of shellfish and have returned to the harbor to deliver them.

374
00:22:16,460 --> 00:22:20,850
I wonder if they can hear her
if she shouts in a loud voice.

375
00:22:27,840 --> 00:22:29,300
A sigh instead.

376
00:22:29,290 --> 00:22:31,460
I wonder if they will come back.

377
00:22:31,450 --> 00:22:34,110
What? She will not shout for them?

378
00:22:34,100 --> 00:22:36,210
What's wrong?

379
00:22:37,040 --> 00:22:38,890
Daddy.

380
00:22:38,880 --> 00:22:46,140
Since her father is completely focused on getting the seashells out he has not noticed the Koiki is there.

381
00:22:45,250 --> 00:22:46,540
I see.

382
00:22:49,300 --> 00:22:55,220
No matter how long she's been standing there she's not shouting out to her dad.

383
00:22:56,120 --> 00:22:59,420
Oh no, is she leaving?

384
00:22:59,560 --> 00:23:01,690
Who are those people out there?

385
00:23:01,680 --> 00:23:03,550
Dad and grandpa.

386
00:23:03,540 --> 00:23:06,990
The cameraman couldn't help himself and spoke to her.

387
00:23:07,180 --> 00:23:10,290
If you shout to them don't you think they will hear you?

388
00:23:10,280 --> 00:23:12,710
She's careful since it's a first.

389
00:23:12,700 --> 00:23:16,820
And she often says "can't do it" and then gives up.

390
00:23:16,810 --> 00:23:19,700
I wonder how it will be today.

391
00:23:21,640 --> 00:23:24,180
Must be a bit embarrassing for her.

392
00:23:24,400 --> 00:23:26,620
Indeed. Indeed.

393
00:23:27,400 --> 00:23:30,470
Nothing came out.

394
00:23:31,240 --> 00:23:37,060
Daddy. Grandpa.

395
00:23:32,620 --> 00:23:34,350
There it is.

396
00:23:37,050 --> 00:23:39,900
Daddy. Grandpa.

397
00:23:39,890 --> 00:23:44,940
Yes, she shouted out to them.
But they can't hear her.

398
00:23:44,930 --> 00:23:51,330
Her voice didn't reach them but she won't quit.

399
00:23:51,320 --> 00:23:56,650
One, two and... Father.

400
00:23:56,640 --> 00:23:59,300
Grandpa.

401
00:23:59,290 --> 00:24:06,410
At 3 years and 9 months
this is the loudest she has ever been in her life.

402
00:24:06,400 --> 00:24:08,470
Koiki.

403
00:24:08,460 --> 00:24:11,770
Her voice reached her father.

404
00:24:11,760 --> 00:24:14,630
Koiki.

405
00:24:21,680 --> 00:24:24,510
Daddy.

406
00:24:26,080 --> 00:24:28,300
Koiki.

407
00:24:28,920 --> 00:24:31,810
They are like lovers.

408
00:24:30,730 --> 00:24:33,870
The affectionate bond between Koiki and her dad.

409
00:24:38,440 --> 00:24:42,830
You forgot your lunch.

410
00:24:44,490 --> 00:24:48,070
I came here to bring it to you.

411
00:24:48,060 --> 00:24:53,850
The voices of the two is flying across the harbor.

412
00:24:54,540 --> 00:24:59,140
O-Onigiri. You forgot it.

413
00:24:59,130 --> 00:25:01,090
Koiki.

414
00:25:01,080 --> 00:25:03,940
Daddy.

415
00:25:03,060 --> 00:25:04,340
Daddy.

416
00:25:04,330 --> 00:25:07,630
Koiki.. the harbor...

417
00:25:05,370 --> 00:25:07,270
What?

418
00:25:07,650 --> 00:25:09,850
Please wait at the harbor.

419
00:25:10,090 --> 00:25:13,110
Understood.

420
00:25:15,880 --> 00:25:18,300
Oh no, tears are starting.

421
00:25:17,880 --> 00:25:20,090
I get it. Of course they would.

422
00:25:22,000 --> 00:25:28,610
Because of how long they spent touchingly shouting at each other she had to wait an extra 12 minutes for them.

423
00:25:30,980 --> 00:25:34,970
- Did you come by yourself? How great.

424
00:25:30,980 --> 00:25:34,970
- Yup.

425
00:25:34,960 --> 00:25:37,310
I came alone.

426
00:25:39,890 --> 00:25:44,620
There's also grandpas lunch.

427
00:25:39,890 --> 00:25:44,620
You also brought mine? Thank you.

428
00:25:44,610 --> 00:25:47,740
Sorry for making you wait grandpa.

429
00:25:48,410 --> 00:25:54,660
Remembering the word pipi she didn't cry even once.

430
00:25:54,650 --> 00:25:59,550
Dad, I love you.

431
00:26:01,210 --> 00:26:03,820
I also love you very much.

432
00:26:05,700 --> 00:26:08,460
There's no room for grandpa in this equation.

433
00:26:09,490 --> 00:26:11,610
- Hey grandpa.
- He looks so lonely.

434
00:26:11,600 --> 00:26:17,870
Because she excelled at this errand the father has thought up the next one.

435
00:26:17,860 --> 00:26:23,700
The filefish and turban shell that we just caught

436
00:26:23,690 --> 00:26:26,260
can you bring them to Genbei?

437
00:26:26,250 --> 00:26:28,410
Koiki responds immediately.

438
00:26:28,400 --> 00:26:35,820
She will have to bring them to the guesthouse at her fathers childhood home called Genbei.

439
00:26:36,600 --> 00:26:38,490
It's true.

440
00:26:38,480 --> 00:26:40,090
See? They are right here.

441
00:26:40,080 --> 00:26:43,770
The filefish that they caught this morning are still alive.

442
00:26:43,760 --> 00:26:46,370
Koiki look.

443
00:26:46,360 --> 00:26:48,110
Looks heavy.

444
00:26:48,100 --> 00:26:49,770
Even turban shell.

445
00:26:49,760 --> 00:26:53,050
It's peeking out.

446
00:26:53,040 --> 00:26:56,540
They caught 3 of each type.

447
00:26:56,530 --> 00:26:59,590
That's quite a heavy load.
I wonder if it will be fine.

448
00:26:57,930 --> 00:27:00,270
- That's heavy.
- Yeah, it will be.

449
00:27:01,450 --> 00:27:05,150
First she will go to the marketplace
and get them to add ice.

450
00:27:05,140 --> 00:27:10,710
The guesthouse Genbei is further away.

451
00:27:10,700 --> 00:27:11,150
What?

452
00:27:11,650 --> 00:27:13,630
Koiki will you use this one?

453
00:27:11,650 --> 00:27:13,630
Yeah.

454
00:27:13,620 --> 00:27:16,700
A secret weapon.

455
00:27:16,690 --> 00:27:18,810
What is a secret weapon?

456
00:27:19,060 --> 00:27:22,820
Father got it from a hardware store just this morning.

457
00:27:22,810 --> 00:27:29,620
For 2950 yen.
With this she can carry anything.

458
00:27:29,610 --> 00:27:30,890
I'm begging you.

459
00:27:29,610 --> 00:27:30,890
I'm heading off.

460
00:27:30,880 --> 00:27:34,970
The father has been planning for this day for a month.

461
00:27:34,960 --> 00:27:36,850
Do your best until you reach Genbei.

462
00:27:36,840 --> 00:27:40,170
Just hoping that this will be a good memory for Koiki.

463
00:27:40,210 --> 00:27:43,450
You two love each other a lot.

464
00:27:43,860 --> 00:27:45,870
I still hold back on my emotions.

465
00:27:46,810 --> 00:27:47,860
Father.

466
00:27:47,850 --> 00:27:51,270
And about the expression of love that cost 2950 yen.

467
00:27:51,860 --> 00:27:55,070
Koiki has taken it to her.

468
00:27:55,060 --> 00:27:59,490
Since it is past noon calm has fallen over the marketplace.

469
00:27:59,480 --> 00:28:06,130
Her fathers senior at his middle school -
Masayoshi - works there.

470
00:28:06,120 --> 00:28:11,620
They've arranged that if she shouts
"Masayoshi" then he will come out.

471
00:28:11,610 --> 00:28:16,610
But she's a bit scared by her fathers senior.

472
00:28:17,580 --> 00:28:19,750
Even though he's a kind person.

473
00:28:18,620 --> 00:28:20,470
Too scary looking.

474
00:28:19,740 --> 00:28:24,310
It might be due to him always talking in a loud voice.

475
00:28:24,300 --> 00:28:27,230
Wonder if Koiki will be alright.

476
00:28:28,370 --> 00:28:34,540
Let's see if she will manage to
call him in a confident voice.

477
00:28:38,530 --> 00:28:40,100
Masayoshi.

478
00:28:40,090 --> 00:28:41,500
She did.

479
00:28:41,490 --> 00:28:43,230
I came on an errand by myself.

480
00:28:43,220 --> 00:28:45,860
An errand? To do what?

481
00:28:45,850 --> 00:28:49,950
Did you come by yourself?
How remarkable you are.

482
00:28:49,940 --> 00:28:52,060
What? He's a very kind person.

483
00:28:52,050 --> 00:28:55,570
Just like her father. Men of the sea
are both strong and kind.

484
00:28:55,560 --> 00:28:58,830
Masayoshi has worked at the fish market for 26 years.

485
00:28:58,820 --> 00:29:03,470
He's working there as a general worker.

486
00:29:03,460 --> 00:29:04,810
There's some tape inside.

487
00:29:04,800 --> 00:29:08,590
Oh, so they prepared some tape for it.
What will you do with it?

488
00:29:08,580 --> 00:29:10,350
This?

489
00:29:10,340 --> 00:29:11,550
To put some ice in it.

490
00:29:11,540 --> 00:29:14,970
Put ice in it. Alright, I will put some in for you.

491
00:29:14,960 --> 00:29:18,810
Since it's after hours for the market
he's been waiting all this time.

492
00:29:18,800 --> 00:29:19,910
Thank you.

493
00:29:19,900 --> 00:29:21,930
This will be enough, right?

494
00:29:21,920 --> 00:29:23,250
Be careful.

495
00:29:23,240 --> 00:29:25,810
He's known her since she was born.

496
00:29:25,800 --> 00:29:27,210
He's so kind.

497
00:29:35,210 --> 00:29:40,340
From just being thought of as a baby
she is now regarded as a big sister.

498
00:29:40,330 --> 00:29:45,830
Thanks to daddy's secret weapon carrying it would be easy-peasy is what they thought but...

499
00:29:45,820 --> 00:29:49,060
it's not that easy either.

500
00:29:49,050 --> 00:29:54,350
Koiki who usually quits right away won't quit today.

501
00:29:54,340 --> 00:29:58,210
She pulls with all her power.

502
00:29:58,200 --> 00:30:01,510
She could've just used the road.

503
00:30:01,500 --> 00:30:05,130
Thanks to pipi she won't cry or give up

504
00:30:05,120 --> 00:30:09,620
cause she is carrying her fathers catch of the day.

505
00:30:10,210 --> 00:30:14,330
She has arrived at the guesthouse Genbei.
The house her father grew up in.

506
00:30:14,320 --> 00:30:20,940
Her dad told her that when she's at the entrance she should yell out: "Mom, please come and help."

507
00:30:20,930 --> 00:30:22,430
Ah, did she arrive?

508
00:30:22,420 --> 00:30:26,810
She noticed her but she has decided not to come out until she is being called.

509
00:30:26,800 --> 00:30:30,690
She's not calling for her mom.

510
00:30:30,680 --> 00:30:32,610
Is she carrying it alone?

511
00:30:31,720 --> 00:30:34,780
She intends to bring it in all by herself.

512
00:30:34,770 --> 00:30:36,780
That's quite impressive.

513
00:30:37,240 --> 00:30:43,350
She has made sure to open the doors wide open
but it's still heavy from all the ice.

514
00:30:47,180 --> 00:30:53,490
She can't get it over the last 10 cm of the last step.

515
00:30:55,890 --> 00:30:58,750
Even though she could've gotten her mother to help.

516
00:30:59,930 --> 00:31:01,180
She's great.

517
00:31:01,170 --> 00:31:04,460
But she wants to do it by herself until the last step.

518
00:31:03,560 --> 00:31:04,910
How remarkable.

519
00:31:04,900 --> 00:31:09,620
She can't quit now that she brought it all by herself.

520
00:31:14,570 --> 00:31:17,090
Properly closing the screen doors.

521
00:31:16,730 --> 00:31:18,620
She's excellent.

522
00:31:22,080 --> 00:31:25,010
And with this the errand is done.

523
00:31:23,520 --> 00:31:24,980
Splendid.

524
00:31:25,000 --> 00:31:27,290
I brought it.

525
00:31:28,840 --> 00:31:30,970
Yes.

526
00:31:30,960 --> 00:31:32,870
I brought it with me mommy.

527
00:31:32,860 --> 00:31:35,370
Thank you very much.

528
00:31:35,360 --> 00:31:38,620
Turns out she's actually a really strong-willed kid.

529
00:31:38,610 --> 00:31:43,830
This is the first time her mother has seen Koiki's face so full of confidence.

530
00:31:43,820 --> 00:31:45,410
Welcome home.

531
00:31:45,400 --> 00:31:47,450
I'm back.

532
00:31:48,290 --> 00:31:52,540
Thanks to the ice they managed to create an extremely fresh dish.

533
00:31:52,530 --> 00:31:54,710
Daddy, I'm home.

534
00:31:54,700 --> 00:31:59,190
She's enjoying it with such a prideful face.

535
00:31:59,180 --> 00:32:00,410
How is it?

536
00:31:59,180 --> 00:32:00,410
It's delicious.

537
00:32:00,400 --> 00:32:02,050
Is it delicious?

538
00:32:00,400 --> 00:32:02,050
Is it delicious?

539
00:32:03,040 --> 00:32:04,900
Koiki, who will you marry?

540
00:32:04,890 --> 00:32:07,430
Daddy.

541
00:32:07,420 --> 00:32:10,030
That's what she always says.

542
00:32:12,880 --> 00:32:14,250
How wonderful.

543
00:32:14,240 --> 00:32:16,470
This was truly a wonderful errand.

544
00:32:16,460 --> 00:32:22,710
It was truly an adorable dad and daughter couple and you seemed really touched when they called each other.

545
00:32:22,700 --> 00:32:28,050
It was like a trendy drama.
They went "Koiki" and "daddy".

546
00:32:28,040 --> 00:32:30,470
There's no room for grandpa in this duo.

547
00:32:30,460 --> 00:32:31,750
He seemed so dejected.

548
00:32:31,740 --> 00:32:33,780
He just wants to eat with the other two.

549
00:32:33,770 --> 00:32:36,450
His face told the entire tale.

550
00:32:36,440 --> 00:32:40,970
- Imagine that dad on her wedding day.
- Yeah, he will be crying big time.

551
00:32:40,960 --> 00:32:44,370
- He will watch this video on that day.
- No doubt.

552
00:32:45,490 --> 00:32:50,380
- And you have a huge family, right?
- Yes, I have 6 children.

553
00:32:50,370 --> 00:32:52,650
The youngest one is 4 years old.

554
00:32:52,640 --> 00:32:57,420
But I've never put anyone out on an errand. So I'm amazed by how well raised the kids here are.

555
00:32:57,410 --> 00:33:00,250
Yeah, the parents must train them well for this.

556
00:33:00,240 --> 00:33:04,220
With Koiki I thought it was amazing how she brought the luggage in herself.

557
00:33:04,210 --> 00:33:06,610
Her parents have clearly told her

558
00:33:06,600 --> 00:33:09,590
"if you open something then close it."

559
00:33:09,580 --> 00:33:14,420
and she did close it but there
was still a small crack left, right?

560
00:33:14,410 --> 00:33:16,540
I think that was so cute.

561
00:33:17,100 --> 00:33:23,420
In the vicinity of Sumida river we find high-rise buildings erected in the heart of Tokyo.

562
00:33:23,410 --> 00:33:30,710
And as you enter the shopping street it starts smelling of Monjayaki like a true Edo part of town.

563
00:33:30,700 --> 00:33:34,510
The father brought a house in this desirable building before marrying.

564
00:33:34,500 --> 00:33:35,970
Then he fulfilled his dream.

565
00:33:35,960 --> 00:33:38,230
The one who was born here is Ryuta.

566
00:33:38,220 --> 00:33:41,230
A stylish kid who will only wear the fanciest shoes.

567
00:33:41,220 --> 00:33:44,810
Looking good is a recent interest of his.

568
00:33:43,740 --> 00:33:45,210
He does look stylish

569
00:33:46,000 --> 00:33:49,740
Today at Ryu's house a friend has come to play.

570
00:33:49,730 --> 00:33:52,460
Soichiro who lives in a similar apartment.

571
00:33:52,810 --> 00:33:56,660
His favorite food is fatty tuna, herring roe and mitarashi rice balls.

572
00:33:56,650 --> 00:33:59,340
His mother is born in Tsukijima (the famous fish market).

573
00:33:59,330 --> 00:34:02,580
Ryu who gets things done and Sou who is more prudent.

574
00:34:02,570 --> 00:34:07,610
They are like axel and break so their mothers thought of an errand they could both go on.

575
00:34:07,600 --> 00:34:12,140
But they live right next to the famous monjayaki street of Tsukushima.

576
00:34:12,130 --> 00:34:14,050
Everything can be found here.

577
00:34:14,040 --> 00:34:16,890
So they will be requested by Sou's grandma in Tsukiji.

578
00:34:16,880 --> 00:34:20,110
- It's a-chan so please sit here.
- Who is a-chan?

579
00:34:20,100 --> 00:34:21,650
My grandmother.

580
00:34:21,640 --> 00:34:23,380
That's nice. Is her house near?

581
00:34:23,370 --> 00:34:24,950
Tsukiji.

582
00:34:24,940 --> 00:34:26,510
Is that so?

583
00:34:26,500 --> 00:34:31,730
Crossing the Tsukuda bridge they will go to grandmas house to get some fish.

584
00:34:31,720 --> 00:34:34,950
Back over the bridge to get diapers for little brother.

585
00:34:34,940 --> 00:34:38,450
And then getting yoghurt from the supermarket.

586
00:34:36,850 --> 00:34:38,170
So difficult.

587
00:34:39,560 --> 00:34:45,490
Ryu is the one wearing the strong yellow and the other one is Sou.

588
00:34:45,900 --> 00:34:47,540
Which way?

589
00:34:47,530 --> 00:34:50,260
The one who knows the way to Tsukiji is Sou.

590
00:34:50,250 --> 00:34:53,110
and the one who knows the way to the drug store is Ryu.

591
00:34:53,100 --> 00:34:56,690
Since they are going together they share the responsibility.

592
00:34:56,680 --> 00:35:03,870
To keep them from fighting the mothers made sure to only give them one bag that they have to share.

593
00:35:04,970 --> 00:35:06,530
Ah, I found a camera.

594
00:35:06,520 --> 00:35:08,820
The one who noticed is Sou.

595
00:35:08,810 --> 00:35:11,610
Please don't look at them.

596
00:35:10,080 --> 00:35:12,020
- This is bad.
- Don't say a thing.

597
00:35:11,600 --> 00:35:13,250
I found yet another camera.

598
00:35:13,240 --> 00:35:15,810
This is bad. We can't film like this.

599
00:35:15,800 --> 00:35:19,100
But it's fine. In those situations...

600
00:35:19,090 --> 00:35:21,690
Good day.

601
00:35:19,090 --> 00:35:21,690
What's this?

602
00:35:21,680 --> 00:35:23,690
This is for measuring electricity.

603
00:35:23,680 --> 00:35:26,380
They immediately lost interest.

604
00:35:26,370 --> 00:35:28,370
Look at our matching rubber boots.

605
00:35:28,360 --> 00:35:30,330
Proud of being stylish.

606
00:35:30,320 --> 00:35:33,860
Since I lent them to Ryuta.

607
00:35:33,850 --> 00:35:39,800
Even if they have noticed the cameras they aren't aware that they are being filmed.

608
00:35:39,790 --> 00:35:42,170
They are only focused on one thing.

609
00:35:42,160 --> 00:35:48,800
Prior experiments with this filming style has taught us that it's possible to get away with until they are about 5 years and 3 months old.

610
00:35:48,790 --> 00:35:59,610
Errand. Errand. It's fun.
Since it's fun then it's fun.

611
00:35:59,600 --> 00:36:02,470
Ah, another camera.
God day.

612
00:36:02,460 --> 00:36:04,150
Even if they see it no worries.

613
00:36:04,140 --> 00:36:05,870
Also measuring the electricity.

614
00:36:05,860 --> 00:36:07,820
Also measuring the electricity.

615
00:36:06,650 --> 00:36:11,830
Ah, there too. An there too!

616
00:36:11,820 --> 00:36:12,750
For real.

617
00:36:12,740 --> 00:36:15,580
No matter how well hidden the boys spot them easily.

618
00:36:15,570 --> 00:36:17,310
Many over there.

619
00:36:17,300 --> 00:36:19,210
Are you counting them?

620
00:36:19,290 --> 00:36:20,380
Getting peckish.

621
00:36:20,370 --> 00:36:21,590
Finally something new.

622
00:36:21,820 --> 00:36:22,830
Let's have a drink.

623
00:36:23,040 --> 00:36:24,270
Nice idea.

624
00:36:24,260 --> 00:36:31,510
Since they are good friends they share water bottle.
They are thirsty from all the talking.

625
00:36:32,670 --> 00:36:34,960
You drink so gracefully.

626
00:36:34,950 --> 00:36:37,940
Let's see a point from the cameramens guide.

627
00:36:37,930 --> 00:36:40,810
"If they are asked then they should ask a new question."

628
00:36:40,800 --> 00:36:42,790
What are you doing?

629
00:36:42,780 --> 00:36:43,750
Work.

630
00:36:43,740 --> 00:36:44,830
What kind of work?

631
00:36:44,850 --> 00:36:46,160
What are you two up to?

632
00:36:46,160 --> 00:36:47,090
We are...

633
00:36:47,080 --> 00:36:47,460
Errand.

634
00:36:47,450 --> 00:36:48,590
The topic changed.

635
00:36:48,580 --> 00:36:50,290
Going on an errand by ourselves.

636
00:36:50,280 --> 00:36:51,830
The two of us.

637
00:36:51,820 --> 00:36:55,420
Because we were asked to do it.

638
00:36:55,410 --> 00:36:56,000
I see.

639
00:36:55,990 --> 00:36:59,800
Bye bye.

640
00:36:59,790 --> 00:37:01,530
It smells good here.

641
00:37:01,520 --> 00:37:03,220
Doesn't it?

642
00:37:03,470 --> 00:37:06,330
They've reached this far without fighting.

643
00:37:06,320 --> 00:37:10,470
They have neared Kachidoki bridge which is near their grandmothers house.

644
00:37:13,630 --> 00:37:16,120
Both are born between January and April 1st.

645
00:37:16,110 --> 00:37:20,520
They often fight about who is in the wrong and pass the blame to each other.

646
00:37:20,510 --> 00:37:24,620
But when they turned 4 they suddenly stopped fighting.

647
00:37:25,150 --> 00:37:30,150
They have found a way to reconcile and become good friends.

648
00:37:30,140 --> 00:37:31,660
That's a good thing.

649
00:37:31,340 --> 00:37:33,480
Grandmas house is just around the corner.

650
00:37:36,280 --> 00:37:38,140
Does this happen in real life?

651
00:37:38,130 --> 00:37:39,570
Who is at fault?

652
00:37:39,560 --> 00:37:40,570
Are they okay?

653
00:37:41,140 --> 00:37:43,450
Let's watch it again.

654
00:37:43,500 --> 00:37:45,190
Does this happen in real life?

655
00:37:50,760 --> 00:37:53,670
Oh no, will they fight?

656
00:37:51,000 --> 00:37:52,980
Equally to blame.

657
00:37:53,660 --> 00:37:55,490
I have to apologize.

658
00:37:55,480 --> 00:37:56,840
I'm sorry.

659
00:37:56,830 --> 00:37:57,620
It's alright.

660
00:37:57,680 --> 00:37:58,450
Let's go?

661
00:37:59,480 --> 00:38:01,250
Hurt, didn't it?

662
00:38:01,240 --> 00:38:05,520
So this is how they've avoided fighting.

663
00:38:05,510 --> 00:38:07,520
Here? Is it much further?

664
00:38:09,190 --> 00:38:10,490
Stop!

665
00:38:10,480 --> 00:38:11,860
Here?

666
00:38:12,460 --> 00:38:14,370
Arrival at grandmas house.

667
00:38:14,360 --> 00:38:18,450
She lives on the first floor so they need to hit the doorbell.

668
00:38:20,030 --> 00:38:23,270
Grandma, I came all by myself.

669
00:38:23,200 --> 00:38:24,550
But they both came.

670
00:38:24,540 --> 00:38:25,750
I see, So.

671
00:38:25,740 --> 00:38:27,830
I came with my friend.

672
00:38:27,820 --> 00:38:31,790
He let his friend go first.
"Please go first."

673
00:38:31,780 --> 00:38:35,450
And he heads straight for the house altar.

674
00:38:35,440 --> 00:38:43,650
Ryu is well-brought up. When visiting a house he prays at their altar. I'm sure his friends' ancestors will be pleased.

675
00:38:44,640 --> 00:38:46,450
The sounds are a bit odd.

676
00:38:46,440 --> 00:38:47,770
The other way.

677
00:38:47,610 --> 00:38:50,660
Ah, he's using the wrong end.

678
00:38:50,650 --> 00:38:55,870
The grandmother starts to pack
the best parts of the fish that she has.

679
00:38:55,860 --> 00:38:57,690
This fish is definitely delicious.

680
00:38:57,680 --> 00:38:58,950
Lend me this.

681
00:38:58,940 --> 00:39:00,290
It's Ryu's camera.

682
00:39:00,280 --> 00:39:01,670
Go ahead.

683
00:39:01,660 --> 00:39:05,320
They need a picture to prove that they did the errand.

684
00:39:05,310 --> 00:39:07,450
Ryu took it for them.

685
00:39:08,060 --> 00:39:10,580
This picture will prove it.

686
00:39:10,190 --> 00:39:11,170
He's making a face.

687
00:39:11,160 --> 00:39:12,930
We've walked so much already.

688
00:39:12,920 --> 00:39:13,910
That's right.

689
00:39:13,900 --> 00:39:15,990
I'm getting kind of tired.

690
00:39:15,980 --> 00:39:21,060
Tired? There's still more to go.
Both the drug store and supermarket are waiting.

691
00:39:20,060 --> 00:39:21,050
I see.

692
00:39:21,050 --> 00:39:22,520
Let's buy some juice.

693
00:39:22,510 --> 00:39:23,990
Ryu who acts on his impulses.

694
00:39:24,010 --> 00:39:26,040
We'll use up all our money.

695
00:39:26,030 --> 00:39:28,300
That's no good. Let's go.

696
00:39:28,290 --> 00:39:29,230
Exactly.

697
00:39:29,220 --> 00:39:31,140
Let's go play in the park.

698
00:39:31,130 --> 00:39:31,920
Ryu again.

699
00:39:31,910 --> 00:39:33,320
Let's go to the park.

700
00:39:33,310 --> 00:39:34,510
No thanks.

701
00:39:34,600 --> 00:39:35,830
We can't.

702
00:39:35,850 --> 00:39:37,430
Aw, shucks.

703
00:39:37,420 --> 00:39:38,090
We can't.

704
00:39:38,080 --> 00:39:39,170
Yes we can.

705
00:39:39,160 --> 00:39:40,170
We can't.

706
00:39:40,160 --> 00:39:42,370
We will be scolded by our mothers.

707
00:39:41,870 --> 00:39:43,170
You will be scolded.

708
00:39:42,360 --> 00:39:44,930
The prudent Sou puts a stop to it.

709
00:39:44,920 --> 00:39:46,340
Let's go next time.

710
00:39:46,330 --> 00:39:47,780
Will they fight each other?

711
00:39:47,770 --> 00:39:48,460
Will they?

712
00:39:59,270 --> 00:40:00,710
Let's go to the park.

713
00:40:00,700 --> 00:40:03,230
No thanks. We can't.

714
00:40:03,220 --> 00:40:04,730
Aw, shucks.

715
00:40:04,720 --> 00:40:05,450
We can't.

716
00:40:05,440 --> 00:40:06,570
Yes we can.

717
00:40:06,560 --> 00:40:07,570
We can't.

718
00:40:07,560 --> 00:40:09,700
We will be scolded by our mothers.

719
00:40:09,720 --> 00:40:12,230
The prudent Sou puts a stop to it.

720
00:40:12,270 --> 00:40:13,540
Let's go next time.

721
00:40:13,530 --> 00:40:15,350
Will they fight each other?

722
00:40:15,340 --> 00:40:16,020
Will they?

723
00:40:16,010 --> 00:40:20,820
Swing swing goes the swing

724
00:40:17,130 --> 00:40:20,820
This is what they've started doing to avoid fights.

725
00:40:21,270 --> 00:40:23,240
This is Kachidoki bridge.

726
00:40:24,090 --> 00:40:28,490
Ka●chi●do●ki bridge is what it says.

727
00:40:25,520 --> 00:40:26,920
So he can read?

728
00:40:28,470 --> 00:40:32,770
This isn't the route their mothers suggested but it's even faster.

729
00:40:32,760 --> 00:40:37,490
They just have to cross the bridge and head for Tsukishima.

730
00:40:38,130 --> 00:40:40,150
Let's take a commemorative photograph.

731
00:40:40,140 --> 00:40:43,570
Now they can remember walking back on Kachidoki bridge.

732
00:40:43,560 --> 00:40:45,450
What an amazing scenery.

733
00:40:45,440 --> 00:40:47,560
Will they remember the trip by this?

734
00:40:48,590 --> 00:40:54,290
Crossing the bridge is a first for both of them
and yet they didn't take a picture of the bridge.

735
00:40:54,280 --> 00:40:55,450
We've crossed it.

736
00:40:55,520 --> 00:40:57,310
Let's take another picture.

737
00:40:57,300 --> 00:41:00,790
Exactly. Take a picture of the plaque. However...

738
00:41:00,780 --> 00:41:03,270
I don't understand it.

739
00:41:00,780 --> 00:41:03,270
They can't read kanji yet.

740
00:41:03,260 --> 00:41:05,350
Then it's better not to take a picture.

741
00:41:05,340 --> 00:41:09,270
They won't take a picture since they can't read the sign.

742
00:41:07,870 --> 00:41:09,290
They don't understand it.

743
00:41:09,280 --> 00:41:12,440
They've returned to the monjayaki street of Tsukishima.

744
00:41:12,430 --> 00:41:14,630
It might be sold out.

745
00:41:14,620 --> 00:41:18,010
They are heading for the drugs store a block from Ryu's house.

746
00:41:18,490 --> 00:41:19,520
Ryuta?

747
00:41:19,510 --> 00:41:20,280
Yes?

748
00:41:20,270 --> 00:41:22,020
Is our house this way?

749
00:41:22,080 --> 00:41:23,860
See? We've reached our house.

750
00:41:23,850 --> 00:41:24,900
We have.

751
00:41:24,890 --> 00:41:28,170
But which direction should they go from here?

752
00:41:28,160 --> 00:41:30,010
Where is Papasu?

753
00:41:30,000 --> 00:41:32,370
Let's find someone so ask.

754
00:41:32,360 --> 00:41:36,340
They asked the cameraman who has been stationed in front of their apartment.

755
00:41:36,330 --> 00:41:38,600
This shop has been here in 60 years.

756
00:41:38,590 --> 00:41:39,430
Papasu.

757
00:41:39,420 --> 00:41:41,440
Papasu on the other hand is a new shop.

758
00:41:41,430 --> 00:41:42,450
It's the other way.

759
00:41:42,440 --> 00:41:43,570
The old lady knew.

760
00:41:43,560 --> 00:41:44,900
Over there.

761
00:41:44,910 --> 00:41:46,290
We are on an errand.

762
00:41:46,280 --> 00:41:47,300
It's this way.

763
00:41:47,290 --> 00:41:50,630
The old lady knows both the old and new shops.

764
00:41:50,610 --> 00:41:52,280
Ah, Papasu is this way.

765
00:41:52,270 --> 00:41:55,220
It's over there so you have to cross at the crossing.

766
00:41:55,210 --> 00:41:56,740
Papasu.

767
00:41:55,210 --> 00:41:56,740
We can do it.

768
00:41:56,730 --> 00:41:58,870
You can? It's just over there.

769
00:41:58,860 --> 00:42:00,000
Take care.

770
00:41:58,860 --> 00:42:00,000
We can do it.

771
00:41:59,990 --> 00:42:00,930
Let's go.

772
00:42:00,920 --> 00:42:02,950
Helpful instructions.

773
00:42:00,920 --> 00:42:02,950
Thank you.

774
00:42:02,940 --> 00:42:04,890
She swiftly went back.

775
00:42:06,280 --> 00:42:07,850
Let's hurry.

776
00:42:07,840 --> 00:42:09,010
This way.

777
00:42:09,000 --> 00:42:14,670
They are bying diapers for their little brothers.
Medium for Sou and Big size for Ryu.

778
00:42:14,660 --> 00:42:17,370
I want M.

779
00:42:14,660 --> 00:42:17,370
We want M, right?

780
00:42:17,360 --> 00:42:19,060
Let's go with M.

781
00:42:19,050 --> 00:42:22,190
He's following Ryu's lead.

782
00:42:22,180 --> 00:42:23,960
Where are there more diapers?

783
00:42:23,950 --> 00:42:26,680
He's never had to purchase diapers before.

784
00:42:26,670 --> 00:42:28,220
M? L?

785
00:42:29,260 --> 00:42:31,460
Which one was it?

786
00:42:31,450 --> 00:42:34,690
I was told to get the big ones.

787
00:42:31,450 --> 00:42:34,690
The big ones?

788
00:42:35,020 --> 00:42:36,340
That would be Big.

789
00:42:36,330 --> 00:42:37,620
Big?

790
00:42:37,610 --> 00:42:39,260
Ah! It's Big.

791
00:42:39,250 --> 00:42:42,190
It's Big. That was a bit hard.

792
00:42:47,960 --> 00:42:54,870
Errand                        errand                        how jolly

793
00:42:54,860 --> 00:42:58,090
They didn't fight even once so far.

794
00:42:58,080 --> 00:43:00,250
Only yoghurt is remaining.

795
00:43:02,700 --> 00:43:03,970
What are we getting?

796
00:43:03,960 --> 00:43:07,490
The yoghurt they want is placed on a high shelf.

797
00:43:07,480 --> 00:43:08,600
Can we grab it?

798
00:43:09,160 --> 00:43:11,600
Ryu is 105 cm tall.

799
00:43:11,590 --> 00:43:12,010
Go.

800
00:43:12,750 --> 00:43:14,110
Be careful.

801
00:43:12,860 --> 00:43:14,230
Can't reach it.

802
00:43:14,800 --> 00:43:15,840
I will grab it.

803
00:43:15,830 --> 00:43:18,470
Sou is 5 cm shorter at a mere 100 cm.

804
00:43:18,460 --> 00:43:19,510
Can't reach.

805
00:43:19,070 --> 00:43:20,150
Can't reach.

806
00:43:20,520 --> 00:43:29,430
Ryu steps up to the challenge. The two have learned to help each other out.

807
00:43:33,330 --> 00:43:35,580
This is amazing!

808
00:43:36,810 --> 00:43:38,600
What an amazing feeling.

809
00:43:38,590 --> 00:43:42,140
We better hurry. Our mothers are waiting for us.

810
00:43:42,100 --> 00:43:44,240
Mother.

811
00:43:50,200 --> 00:43:52,110
We walked a lot.

812
00:43:50,200 --> 00:43:52,110
Yep.

813
00:43:54,250 --> 00:43:56,200
I'm exhausted.

814
00:43:56,190 --> 00:44:01,140
Crossing both Tsukuda and Kachidoki bridge.
They've really made the rounds.

815
00:44:01,130 --> 00:44:02,650
See. We've come to my house.

816
00:44:02,800 --> 00:44:04,070
We really have.

817
00:44:08,230 --> 00:44:11,360
Welcome back.

818
00:44:15,330 --> 00:44:18,140
Ah, there's a camera over there.

819
00:44:17,810 --> 00:44:19,010
Oh no.

820
00:44:18,130 --> 00:44:20,610
Ryu immediately finds the cameras.

821
00:44:20,600 --> 00:44:22,810
Why are there cameras?

822
00:44:22,800 --> 00:44:24,360
The electricity company.

823
00:44:24,350 --> 00:44:26,740
Electricity? Are they getting any reception?

824
00:44:26,730 --> 00:44:28,990
That's right. Radio waves.

825
00:44:31,610 --> 00:44:34,150
8 years later...

826
00:44:35,130 --> 00:44:38,860
The two are walking down Kachidoki bridge again.

827
00:44:39,410 --> 00:44:42,960
They are first year students in middle school.

828
00:44:42,950 --> 00:44:48,520
They go to different schools so even if they live close they don't have many opportunities to meet.

829
00:44:48,510 --> 00:44:49,540
Let's take a picture.

830
00:44:49,530 --> 00:44:50,450
Take a picture.

831
00:44:50,440 --> 00:44:52,020
Taking a picture this time?

832
00:44:52,010 --> 00:44:54,500
Wonder if they can read the sign this time.

833
00:44:55,280 --> 00:44:56,690
Which side should I stand on?

834
00:44:56,680 --> 00:44:59,270
Ryuta has grown the most.

835
00:44:59,260 --> 00:45:03,190
He has grown to 172 cm.

836
00:45:03,180 --> 00:45:06,040
Souichirou might start growing from here on.

837
00:45:06,030 --> 00:45:08,710
They've become like a comedic duo.

838
00:45:08,700 --> 00:45:11,460
I can't get your face in frame.

839
00:45:14,430 --> 00:45:17,640
Again? You can't tell where they are in this picture.

840
00:45:19,160 --> 00:45:23,570
Since they are in Tsukishima they might as well eat some monjyayaki.

841
00:45:23,560 --> 00:45:24,460
Can you make it?

842
00:45:24,450 --> 00:45:26,250
I can do it.

843
00:45:26,240 --> 00:45:28,650
Since this is the home town of Ryuta.

844
00:45:28,640 --> 00:45:32,980
He prefers to do it himself.

845
00:45:32,970 --> 00:45:34,540
Ooops, I spilled it.

846
00:45:34,990 --> 00:45:36,370
Spilled it.

847
00:45:39,000 --> 00:45:41,240
He can't do it.

848
00:45:39,000 --> 00:45:41,240
He can't do it.

849
00:45:41,230 --> 00:45:43,210
You gotta use oil first.

850
00:45:43,200 --> 00:45:44,370
Yep, oil first.

851
00:45:44,360 --> 00:45:46,210
You have no clue how to do it.

852
00:45:49,000 --> 00:45:51,430
Eh? He's pouring it from above?

853
00:45:53,310 --> 00:45:55,010
And then chop up the ingredients.

854
00:45:55,470 --> 00:45:57,960
This is how it should be done.

855
00:45:58,010 --> 00:46:00,840
Create a ring and pour the soup in.

856
00:46:00,830 --> 00:46:02,620
Pour it all in.

857
00:46:02,610 --> 00:46:04,530
This is how we always do it.

858
00:46:04,560 --> 00:46:06,430
How annoying.

859
00:46:06,420 --> 00:46:08,870
We need to reinforce the ring first.

860
00:46:08,860 --> 00:46:14,980
I see. Have to wait for the ring to absorb the liquid.

861
00:46:16,300 --> 00:46:20,690
It needs more time. It's still too soft.

862
00:46:20,940 --> 00:46:22,760
Starting to look good.

863
00:46:22,750 --> 00:46:24,650
What school club are you in?

864
00:46:24,640 --> 00:46:25,600
Art.

865
00:46:25,590 --> 00:46:27,920
The club with the least amount of days.

866
00:46:28,960 --> 00:46:34,220
While it's with fewer days here is Ryuta painting.

867
00:46:34,210 --> 00:46:38,330
He loves mountains and sceneries.

868
00:46:38,320 --> 00:46:40,760
What about Souichiro?

869
00:46:40,820 --> 00:46:47,910
From the age of 4 he's been going with his family every season. He's been excelling through even the harder trails.

870
00:46:40,820 --> 00:46:47,910
Little brother.

871
00:46:48,170 --> 00:46:51,430
The ski club has even fewer days.

872
00:46:51,420 --> 00:46:57,080
They've both selected the club with the least amount of days.

873
00:46:57,070 --> 00:47:01,650
How is the taste of Tsukishima, Souichiro from Tsukiji?

874
00:47:01,640 --> 00:47:02,850
Hot.

875
00:47:02,840 --> 00:47:05,130
Nice. Well said.

876
00:47:05,800 --> 00:47:07,670
Cameraman: Are you giving it to me?

877
00:47:07,660 --> 00:47:10,120
Thank you for everything you have done.

878
00:47:10,110 --> 00:47:16,040
As a thanks to the cameraman for taking a picture of the two on Kachidoki bridge.

879
00:47:16,030 --> 00:47:18,650
In this one it is clear where they are.

880
00:47:21,010 --> 00:47:22,960
What a nice errand.

881
00:47:22,950 --> 00:47:24,170
Right?

882
00:47:24,160 --> 00:47:26,030
They've grown so fast.

883
00:47:26,020 --> 00:47:29,410
At that age I thought the two would fight. But they didn't.

884
00:47:29,950 --> 00:47:34,970
It was a nice relationship.
I got so nervous when they found the cameras.

885
00:47:34,960 --> 00:47:41,890
Since they are kids they directly point it out.
If it was an adult they would behave since it's for TV.

886
00:47:42,570 --> 00:47:45,360
And the lie about measuring electricity.

887
00:47:45,740 --> 00:47:51,400
And the cameraman just ignored them.
Can't believe such a simple trick worked.

888
00:47:51,390 --> 00:47:58,040
Simply crossing a bridge can be a huge adventure for a child. Do any of you have experience with that?

889
00:47:58,030 --> 00:48:04,390
My fathers parents live in Miyagi so in elementary school I would go there every summer.

890
00:48:04,380 --> 00:48:08,650
I would go on adventure in the mountains by myself.

891
00:48:08,640 --> 00:48:11,910
And they would tell me to only go exactly this far in.

892
00:48:11,900 --> 00:48:19,710
Every year I would go further across the boundary.
That's what it made me think of.

893
00:48:19,700 --> 00:48:23,220
It's like Stand By Me taking place in Miyagi prefecture.

894
00:48:23,210 --> 00:48:29,950
Next errand, a girl who like her father is a bit ditzy and forgetful.

895
00:48:31,180 --> 00:48:37,880
Seto Inland Sea is a town called Niochou.

896
00:48:36,890 --> 00:48:38,020
Beautiful.

897
00:48:37,870 --> 00:48:42,540
Here they still make salt in the traditional way.

898
00:48:42,530 --> 00:48:47,110
Especially the fairytale-like scenery of Chichibuga seashore.

899
00:48:43,140 --> 00:48:44,970
Ah, beautiful.

900
00:48:47,130 --> 00:48:50,690
This place is currently very popular among young people.

901
00:48:51,690 --> 00:48:55,740
It's very popular for snapping Instagram photos.

902
00:48:54,250 --> 00:48:55,690
Take a look at this.

903
00:48:56,270 --> 00:48:57,030
Amazing.

904
00:48:57,020 --> 00:49:01,490
At that place a father and daughter are taking pictures.

905
00:49:00,890 --> 00:49:02,980
Her posture is like a model.

906
00:49:05,320 --> 00:49:08,370
Actually, her father is a pro cameraman.

907
00:49:08,850 --> 00:49:09,770
Say cheese.

908
00:49:10,560 --> 00:49:16,630
This is An who will go on an errand. She is 4 years and 1 month old and has a younger brother who is 2.

909
00:49:16,620 --> 00:49:19,750
Her father is bringing her up in his own home town.

910
00:49:19,740 --> 00:49:23,090
This old part of town remains like a time capsule.

911
00:49:23,080 --> 00:49:27,850
They purchased an old Japanese home 3 years ago and turned it into an office.

912
00:49:27,840 --> 00:49:31,770
They hope to establish a business of long standing.

913
00:49:32,590 --> 00:49:36,150
1958

914
00:49:32,590 --> 00:49:36,150
This neighborhood used to be sprawling as a shopping district.

915
00:49:36,140 --> 00:49:41,280
While the times have changed what remains the same is the shrine that stands strong.

916
00:49:41,270 --> 00:49:45,940
It goes back to the Edo period and has continued throughout Meiji until now.

917
00:49:47,200 --> 00:49:50,440
This is a pamphlet with pictures the father has taken.

918
00:49:50,430 --> 00:49:55,980
The handmade bread of the old baker lady or a diner. It's full of great information.

919
00:49:55,970 --> 00:50:00,660
He is now gathering information for a new edition.

920
00:50:00,650 --> 00:50:05,380
He's the type who becomes oblivious of their surroundings when focused.

921
00:50:05,370 --> 00:50:07,650
He also forgets a lot.

922
00:50:07,640 --> 00:50:11,300
An watches her father and his hard labor.

923
00:50:11,370 --> 00:50:13,870
As the gets home that day she immediately...

924
00:50:13,860 --> 00:50:15,410
Father is at work.

925
00:50:15,740 --> 00:50:17,170
Again with this.

926
00:50:17,160 --> 00:50:18,240
She found something.

927
00:50:18,230 --> 00:50:19,990
He forgot this.

928
00:50:19,980 --> 00:50:21,160
It's his water bottle.

929
00:50:21,150 --> 00:50:22,200
For real.

930
00:50:22,800 --> 00:50:25,850
Father is such a forgetful guy.

931
00:50:26,300 --> 00:50:27,300
He is.

932
00:50:27,290 --> 00:50:29,300
And then...

933
00:50:29,850 --> 00:50:31,690
The phone. It's dad.

934
00:50:31,680 --> 00:50:32,590
Hello.

935
00:50:32,580 --> 00:50:34,230
Hello.

936
00:50:34,220 --> 00:50:40,770
I forgot my water bottle.
An, can't you bring it?

937
00:50:41,630 --> 00:50:43,400
Okay.

938
00:50:43,390 --> 00:50:45,320
Can you do it?

939
00:50:43,390 --> 00:50:45,320
Yes.

940
00:50:45,310 --> 00:50:47,700
And furthermore...

941
00:50:47,690 --> 00:50:52,840
I also need a cream puff for work reasons.

942
00:50:53,460 --> 00:50:55,930
I will purchase a cream puff for you.

943
00:50:56,270 --> 00:50:57,670
Could you?

944
00:50:58,620 --> 00:51:01,570
It's located next to the town shrine.

945
00:51:01,560 --> 00:51:05,450
It's mainly a place for traditional Japanese confectionary.

946
00:51:05,440 --> 00:51:11,230
The third generation owner has started selling cream puffs with a luxury sugar called Sanuki sanbon.

947
00:51:11,220 --> 00:51:13,660
It's a very popular item.

948
00:51:13,320 --> 00:51:14,770
Amazing. Amazing.

949
00:51:15,000 --> 00:51:20,270
Also at Nori's place buy a trash bag
since I have to clean up around here.

950
00:51:20,260 --> 00:51:21,240
Yep.

951
00:51:21,260 --> 00:51:23,900
Along with her small good luck charm.

952
00:51:25,810 --> 00:51:28,040
She first has to walk 20 meters.

953
00:51:28,030 --> 00:51:30,330
This is the soy sauce makers house.

954
00:51:30,810 --> 00:51:35,330
In old times they used to make soy sauce here but now they just sell it.

955
00:51:35,540 --> 00:51:38,090
They also sell trash bags.

956
00:51:38,890 --> 00:51:44,520
The cream puffs are sold next to the shrine.
All in all 450 meters.

957
00:51:44,510 --> 00:51:46,600
It's a neighorhood errand.

958
00:51:46,590 --> 00:51:47,790
Take care.

959
00:51:47,780 --> 00:51:50,000
I will head off.

960
00:51:50,640 --> 00:51:57,120
In her hands is her dads free pamphlet along with an empty box to put purchased items in.

961
00:51:57,230 --> 00:51:58,020
Hard to carry.

962
00:51:58,010 --> 00:52:00,060
Instead of a shopping bag.

963
00:52:00,080 --> 00:52:07,300
The mother is wondering if she will
be fine since An takes after her father.

964
00:52:07,290 --> 00:52:09,620
Oh, she's looking at the pahmplet.

965
00:52:09,610 --> 00:52:13,220
Cream puffs for dad.

966
00:52:13,490 --> 00:52:14,790
Cream puffs.

967
00:52:14,780 --> 00:52:19,430
That's right. But before that she has to purchase the trash bags.

968
00:52:19,420 --> 00:52:22,520
However, she just passed it.

969
00:52:22,510 --> 00:52:25,630
I will be late if I don't hurry.

970
00:52:25,620 --> 00:52:27,560
For the cream puffs, right?

971
00:52:27,550 --> 00:52:29,560
Wait. Why did she turn?

972
00:52:29,810 --> 00:52:33,370
A building has popped up on this otherwise plain parking lot.

973
00:52:33,360 --> 00:52:39,320
This is a brand new specialty show for handmade cakes.

974
00:52:39,850 --> 00:52:42,410
Two cream puffs, please.

975
00:52:42,590 --> 00:52:44,280
One cream puff?

976
00:52:44,730 --> 00:52:49,260
They usually make round birthday cakes upon request.

977
00:52:49,250 --> 00:52:51,700
They don't even have a display counter.

978
00:52:51,690 --> 00:52:53,510
Two cream puffs? One?

979
00:52:53,500 --> 00:52:55,850
They also make cream puffs here?

980
00:52:55,840 --> 00:52:59,520
They will take her order since she's come all the way.

981
00:52:59,900 --> 00:53:04,680
It will take a little while. Is that okay?

982
00:53:04,670 --> 00:53:06,120
Yep, that's fine.

983
00:53:06,110 --> 00:53:08,240
Okay.

984
00:53:06,110 --> 00:53:08,240
Please come again.

985
00:53:08,230 --> 00:53:10,870
She has made an order.

986
00:53:11,670 --> 00:53:15,700
But she wasn't asked to purchase cream puffs from here.

987
00:53:15,690 --> 00:53:20,990
After ordering the cream puffs she suddenly remembers to trash bags.

988
00:53:20,980 --> 00:53:25,340
He even mentioned the day before
that he intends to clean up his office.

989
00:53:26,170 --> 00:53:30,540
The shop owners are way back in the home part of the building.

990
00:53:30,530 --> 00:53:34,820
Can she say "trash bags, please" in a loud voice?

991
00:53:34,810 --> 00:53:38,280
Cardboard box, please.

992
00:53:38,800 --> 00:53:40,830
Cardboard box, please.

993
00:53:40,840 --> 00:53:43,350
She wasn't asked to get a cardboard box at all.

994
00:53:43,340 --> 00:53:44,770
What are you looking for?

995
00:53:44,760 --> 00:53:45,790
A cardboard box.

996
00:53:45,780 --> 00:53:49,240
A cardboard box? Is that what you are looking for?

997
00:53:49,230 --> 00:53:54,080
Not vinegar? Did they really ask you to get a cardboard box?

998
00:53:54,070 --> 00:53:56,960
Really? A cardboard box.

999
00:53:56,950 --> 00:53:59,000
There are lots of cardboard boxes but...

1000
00:53:58,990 --> 00:54:02,040
If it's a cardboard box how about this one?

1001
00:54:02,030 --> 00:54:06,200
She found an empty box that had
soy sauce in it. She will give it for free.

1002
00:54:06,190 --> 00:54:09,880
Can you take it?
Are you doing an errand for your father?

1003
00:54:09,870 --> 00:54:11,330
Looks heavy.

1004
00:54:11,320 --> 00:54:12,440
Smart kid.

1005
00:54:12,430 --> 00:54:13,940
I will go to my dad's place.

1006
00:54:13,930 --> 00:54:15,400
You are heading there now?

1007
00:54:15,390 --> 00:54:16,590
Thank you.

1008
00:54:16,580 --> 00:54:19,940
There's no trash can in the office.

1009
00:54:19,930 --> 00:54:24,730
For this old district this might be a better way to throw things out in.

1010
00:54:26,640 --> 00:54:31,170
She's tottering along.
But it's light.

1011
00:54:36,580 --> 00:54:41,540
She put it down? Is she taking a break?

1012
00:54:41,670 --> 00:54:45,440
Right, left. All clear, I can continue.

1013
00:54:44,940 --> 00:54:46,090
Remarkable.

1014
00:54:45,810 --> 00:54:49,360
Her father has taught her how to be safe in traffic.

1015
00:54:49,370 --> 00:54:52,430
Head straight through the crossroad.

1016
00:54:53,230 --> 00:54:54,640
He's carrying a lot.

1017
00:54:54,630 --> 00:54:57,110
Wait, she turned left?

1018
00:54:57,100 --> 00:54:59,180
Heading for dads job.

1019
00:54:59,170 --> 00:55:02,390
The staff who were on the right route have to catch up to her.

1020
00:55:02,380 --> 00:55:06,320
Since she didn't head for the right shop this way is actually faster.

1021
00:55:06,310 --> 00:55:08,930
There are so many narrow streets around here.

1022
00:55:11,910 --> 00:55:13,130
Papa.

1023
00:55:13,120 --> 00:55:15,120
Yes? Oh.

1024
00:55:15,110 --> 00:55:17,890
They will be making the cream puffs now.

1025
00:55:17,880 --> 00:55:19,050
Making them now?

1026
00:55:19,040 --> 00:55:19,680
The heck?

1027
00:55:19,670 --> 00:55:22,830
Can I use this as a trash bag?

1028
00:55:22,820 --> 00:55:24,630
Yep. Will this do?

1029
00:55:24,620 --> 00:55:25,640
It will.

1030
00:55:25,630 --> 00:55:27,090
This will do.

1031
00:55:27,080 --> 00:55:29,220
I can use this. Thanks.

1032
00:55:29,210 --> 00:55:31,250
And I brought your water bottle.

1033
00:55:31,240 --> 00:55:33,450
The thing her father forgot.

1034
00:55:33,440 --> 00:55:36,800
This is amazing. You did it all by yourself?

1035
00:55:36,790 --> 00:55:37,590
Yep.

1036
00:55:37,580 --> 00:55:38,470
But An...

1037
00:55:38,460 --> 00:55:43,170
It shouldn't be the case that they haven't made cream puffs.

1038
00:55:43,160 --> 00:55:44,950
Do you see this, An?

1039
00:55:44,940 --> 00:55:45,840
I do.

1040
00:55:45,830 --> 00:55:47,400
A picture of the shop.

1041
00:55:47,390 --> 00:55:49,750
I will go and purchase cream puffs.

1042
00:55:47,390 --> 00:55:49,750
Will you?

1043
00:55:50,080 --> 00:55:51,320
Please and thank you.

1044
00:55:52,490 --> 00:55:53,540
Take care.

1045
00:55:53,530 --> 00:55:58,660
She has seen the front of the building this time.
I wonder if she will be fine.

1046
00:55:58,650 --> 00:56:01,140
She's looking at the pamphlet and comparing it.

1047
00:56:01,130 --> 00:56:04,070
The Japanese confectionary shop.

1048
00:56:04,060 --> 00:56:06,710
The shop is here if she turns.

1049
00:56:06,700 --> 00:56:10,970
However she went straight.

1050
00:56:10,960 --> 00:56:13,470
- Made to run.
- The adults are.

1051
00:56:13,460 --> 00:56:16,700
Rather than shooting they are running more.

1052
00:56:16,690 --> 00:56:17,780
So fast.

1053
00:56:17,200 --> 00:56:19,660
They must also be heading for that famous shop.

1054
00:56:19,650 --> 00:56:21,060
They can't keep up.

1055
00:56:21,200 --> 00:56:23,760
Cream puffs. Cream puffs. Cream puffs.

1056
00:56:23,750 --> 00:56:25,910
She's been out for less than 10 minutes.

1057
00:56:26,460 --> 00:56:31,700
"She's already back" the shop owner must be wondering.

1058
00:56:41,670 --> 00:56:43,330
Cream puffs please.

1059
00:56:43,320 --> 00:56:47,130
They haven't baked yet.

1060
00:56:47,120 --> 00:56:48,410
I see.

1061
00:56:48,400 --> 00:56:51,540
It will take a bit longer. Please come again.

1062
00:56:51,530 --> 00:56:53,910
I will be back later.

1063
00:56:53,900 --> 00:56:57,320
Despite having seen the picture of the correct shop.

1064
00:56:57,310 --> 00:57:01,090
She didn't notice that this is a different shop?

1065
00:56:59,840 --> 00:57:01,400
She runs so much.

1066
00:57:01,080 --> 00:57:03,520
She's going back to her fathers place.

1067
00:57:03,510 --> 00:57:06,480
And the staff is trying to reach the office first.

1068
00:57:06,910 --> 00:57:08,360
How rough.

1069
00:57:08,920 --> 00:57:10,640
She went straight ahead?

1070
00:57:10,630 --> 00:57:12,980
Better visit the shrine.

1071
00:57:10,630 --> 00:57:12,980
The shrine?

1072
00:57:12,970 --> 00:57:16,790
Everyone is competing against An.

1073
00:57:15,350 --> 00:57:17,860
So many are coming out.

1074
00:57:17,850 --> 00:57:19,860
The shrine.

1075
00:57:19,850 --> 00:57:21,790
Why all of a sudden.

1076
00:57:23,550 --> 00:57:28,100
When out for walks with her mother she always visits this shrine.

1077
00:57:28,090 --> 00:57:32,200
These rocks are called Shimeishi and can be found in the ocean.

1078
00:57:32,190 --> 00:57:35,500
They've been here since over 100 years ago.

1079
00:57:37,480 --> 00:57:40,010
Jingle jangle, she's rich.

1080
00:57:40,000 --> 00:57:42,450
How many yen will she put out?

1081
00:57:42,440 --> 00:57:44,340
She's not putting anything in?

1082
00:57:44,330 --> 00:57:46,230
I have no clue.

1083
00:57:46,790 --> 00:57:48,270
A shame.

1084
00:57:47,820 --> 00:57:49,810
She's already leaving?

1085
00:57:49,800 --> 00:57:52,340
She didn't even make a wish.

1086
00:57:52,330 --> 00:57:57,590
The cameramen have no clue anymore.
They are being made to follow her whims.

1087
00:57:57,580 --> 00:58:04,020
An is giving the fight of her life.
But what she intends to do is hard to decipher.

1088
00:58:02,380 --> 00:58:04,000
She's so busy.

1089
00:58:04,010 --> 00:58:05,720
They are still making them.

1090
00:58:05,710 --> 00:58:11,020
They are still making them?
What did the old guy say?

1091
00:58:11,010 --> 00:58:12,930
What? It was an old woman.

1092
00:58:12,920 --> 00:58:15,190
Old woman? And she's making them now?

1093
00:58:15,180 --> 00:58:17,940
Wait, was there ever a woman running that shop?

1094
00:58:17,930 --> 00:58:20,770
Which shop did you go to?

1095
00:58:20,760 --> 00:58:21,850
He noticed it.

1096
00:58:21,840 --> 00:58:27,480
Did you go to the wrong shop?
The shop is this way.

1097
00:58:27,470 --> 00:58:29,300
Go towards the shrine.

1098
00:58:29,290 --> 00:58:36,490
There are many narrow streets here but if she goes this way it will be easy to find.

1099
00:58:37,100 --> 00:58:38,020
Just go this way.

1100
00:58:38,010 --> 00:58:41,450
That's right. It's easier to spot from this direction.

1101
00:58:41,320 --> 00:58:42,630
I will go this way.

1102
00:58:42,330 --> 00:58:43,210
Why why?

1103
00:58:44,140 --> 00:58:45,560
Why this way?

1104
00:58:44,910 --> 00:58:46,340
Her conviction is strong.

1105
00:58:45,540 --> 00:58:50,020
She's inherited this from her dad that she refuses to bow down from her opinions.

1106
00:58:50,190 --> 00:58:52,200
What color coin should I use?

1107
00:58:52,190 --> 00:58:53,210
She came back.

1108
00:58:53,200 --> 00:58:54,450
The brown coins.

1109
00:58:54,440 --> 00:58:57,240
She didn't know the kind of money to put in the box.

1110
00:58:57,230 --> 00:58:59,000
So that's what it was.

1111
00:58:58,080 --> 00:58:59,630
I will be back.

1112
00:58:59,620 --> 00:59:02,040
I see. The shrine is that way.

1113
00:59:02,030 --> 00:59:04,730
[Sponsor announcement]

1114
00:59:21,400 --> 00:59:25,930
I wish my mother will not be sick.

1115
00:59:25,920 --> 00:59:28,470
The mother said she had a sore throat.

1116
00:59:28,720 --> 00:59:32,260
Rather than the cream puffs
the most important thing is mother.

1117
00:59:32,250 --> 00:59:34,390
Ah, it was over here.

1118
00:59:34,380 --> 00:59:35,780
I forgot.

1119
00:59:35,770 --> 00:59:38,680
Cream puffs. Cream puffs.

1120
00:59:38,670 --> 00:59:41,850
The shop is just outside of the gates.

1121
00:59:41,840 --> 00:59:44,420
Why is she going to the side?

1122
00:59:46,060 --> 00:59:47,210
I'm sweating.

1123
00:59:47,200 --> 00:59:49,080
From all the running.

1124
00:59:49,070 --> 00:59:52,100
She taking a small break.

1125
00:59:52,140 --> 00:59:55,170
She's just taking the blouse off.

1126
00:59:55,160 --> 00:59:57,940
She's confirming that she didn't forget anything.

1127
00:59:57,780 --> 00:59:59,000
Admirable.

1128
00:59:58,350 --> 01:00:01,000
She should see the shop just up the road.

1129
01:00:01,050 --> 01:00:04,010
The cameraman has gone in first.

1130
01:00:04,000 --> 01:00:07,390
Look behind you. Behind you.

1131
01:00:08,720 --> 01:00:09,710
Dunno.

1132
01:00:10,120 --> 01:00:14,180
She went back even though it's right there.

1133
01:00:14,170 --> 01:00:16,250
Why can't she spot it?

1134
01:00:16,640 --> 01:00:17,960
Ah, An?

1135
01:00:19,240 --> 01:00:20,470
Did you purchase it?

1136
01:00:20,460 --> 01:00:21,970
Great that you came back.

1137
01:00:21,960 --> 01:00:25,220
She didn't mention the shrine.

1138
01:00:25,560 --> 01:00:27,240
Did you not spot it?

1139
01:00:25,560 --> 01:00:27,240
No.

1140
01:00:27,230 --> 01:00:28,760
It wasn't there?

1141
01:00:27,230 --> 01:00:28,760
Yep.

1142
01:00:28,750 --> 01:00:36,530
An, perhaps you didn't see the picture.
The front looks like this. The sign has green and red letters.

1143
01:00:36,520 --> 01:00:38,840
I'm supposed to look at this?

1144
01:00:38,830 --> 01:00:44,690
An was looking at the cream puff picture.
She wasn't looking at the facade.

1145
01:00:44,680 --> 01:00:47,430
Off you go. This way.

1146
01:00:47,420 --> 01:00:51,650
Around the corner here. Take care and thanks.

1147
01:00:51,640 --> 01:00:54,390
This is the 4th trip.

1148
01:00:54,380 --> 01:00:58,980
This time she is looking at the shop facade.

1149
01:00:58,970 --> 01:01:01,060
Can she find it?

1150
01:01:01,070 --> 01:01:05,480
It's right there. The green and red letters on the sign.

1151
01:01:08,280 --> 01:01:09,960
Ah, found it.

1152
01:01:09,950 --> 01:01:11,620
Thankfully.

1153
01:01:12,400 --> 01:01:16,850
Right, left. All clear, I can continue.

1154
01:01:16,800 --> 01:01:17,860
Nice.

1155
01:01:17,850 --> 01:01:22,570
She's doing it properly.
But she's also hurrying.

1156
01:01:22,560 --> 01:01:27,140
She was asked to purchase two.

1157
01:01:28,140 --> 01:01:29,670
Welcome.

1158
01:01:29,890 --> 01:01:32,810
One cream puff two of those.

1159
01:01:32,800 --> 01:01:34,620
Two? Okay.

1160
01:01:34,990 --> 01:01:39,300
He has them. These are those made with wasanbon sugar.

1161
01:01:39,290 --> 01:01:44,890
One is 175 yen. She put out a 1000 bill so now her purse will jangle even more.

1162
01:01:44,880 --> 01:01:48,500
She became even richer.

1163
01:01:48,490 --> 01:01:50,330
Do you know the way back?

1164
01:01:48,490 --> 01:01:50,330
Yes.

1165
01:01:50,360 --> 01:01:52,690
Please don't get lost again.

1166
01:01:52,680 --> 01:01:55,390
Please wait a bit.

1167
01:01:54,280 --> 01:01:55,170
Phew.

1168
01:01:55,380 --> 01:01:56,550
A reward.

1169
01:01:56,540 --> 01:01:57,520
It's a cookie.

1170
01:01:57,510 --> 01:01:58,780
Enjoy it.

1171
01:01:58,770 --> 01:02:00,620
She received a reward.

1172
01:02:00,610 --> 01:02:03,690
Thank you.

1173
01:02:00,610 --> 01:02:04,250
You're welcome. Take care on your way back.

1174
01:02:04,270 --> 01:02:05,950
After saying her thanks.

1175
01:02:05,940 --> 01:02:09,300
Right, left. All clear, I can continue.

1176
01:02:09,290 --> 01:02:10,650
Being safe in traffic.

1177
01:02:10,640 --> 01:02:12,060
Bye bye.

1178
01:02:12,050 --> 01:02:14,690
She can finally return.

1179
01:02:14,680 --> 01:02:16,410
I will give it to dad.

1180
01:02:16,400 --> 01:02:17,880
Cream puffs.

1181
01:02:18,060 --> 01:02:20,280
Yep.

1182
01:02:18,060 --> 01:02:20,280
You managed to buy it?

1183
01:02:20,270 --> 01:02:21,790
Amazing.

1184
01:02:21,780 --> 01:02:24,200
I found it by myself.

1185
01:02:24,190 --> 01:02:25,320
Perfect.

1186
01:02:26,920 --> 01:02:29,030
Let's take some pictures.

1187
01:02:29,360 --> 01:02:30,850
Here I go.

1188
01:02:30,840 --> 01:02:34,890
She's properly assisting with the reflector board.

1189
01:02:34,880 --> 01:02:38,680
The dad looks cool as he is focused on taking the pictures.

1190
01:02:38,670 --> 01:02:39,930
See?

1191
01:02:39,920 --> 01:02:41,800
Thank you.

1192
01:02:45,380 --> 01:02:47,040
You can eat this one.

1193
01:02:47,030 --> 01:02:49,920
That's why she likes photoshoots of food.

1194
01:02:51,690 --> 01:02:52,770
Delicious.

1195
01:02:52,760 --> 01:02:57,830
Ah, she forgot. She ordered cream puffs at this shop.

1196
01:03:03,180 --> 01:03:04,770
And the dad doesn't know.

1197
01:03:04,760 --> 01:03:07,680
He only knew about the shop over there.

1198
01:03:04,760 --> 01:03:07,680
That's right. That's right.

1199
01:03:07,670 --> 01:03:12,060
He really made her walk around.

1200
01:03:07,670 --> 01:03:12,060
There was a proper reason to get those.

1201
01:03:12,050 --> 01:03:14,650
Why did you come to the shrine?

1202
01:03:14,640 --> 01:03:17,190
I saw you were crying a bit during the conundrum.

1203
01:03:17,180 --> 01:03:19,190
I couldn't stand it.

1204
01:03:19,180 --> 01:03:25,930
I was touched when she properly asked
for her mothers good health.

1205
01:03:25,920 --> 01:03:27,280
Very touching.

1206
01:03:27,270 --> 01:03:30,060
Makes me curious about the cream puffs she ordered.

1207
01:03:27,610 --> 01:03:33,370
On the way back from the errand.

1208
01:03:30,050 --> 01:03:32,680
I wonder until how late the old lady waited for her.

1209
01:03:32,670 --> 01:03:39,850
As a gift for her mother that had a sore throat
they apparently collected it on the way home.

1210
01:03:38,440 --> 01:03:39,720
That's great.

1211
01:03:39,930 --> 01:03:43,020
The bus will be here in a bit.

1212
01:03:43,010 --> 01:03:48,300
These brothers will ride a bus to complete their errand.

1213
01:03:48,290 --> 01:03:49,990
He's so small.

1214
01:03:49,660 --> 01:03:56,040
The 4 year and 3 months old brother and his little brother
at 2 years and 4 months who keeps asking if it's coming.

1215
01:03:49,920 --> 01:03:54,040
Shuya

1216
01:03:51,960 --> 01:03:54,040
Kanaya

1217
01:03:56,030 --> 01:04:04,470
The one who planned this errand and let his little brother join is their mother.

1218
01:04:00,460 --> 01:04:01,730
She's standing there.

1219
01:04:04,460 --> 01:04:07,590
As their mother I am confident that they can handle it.

1220
01:04:07,580 --> 01:04:12,870
Some strong words.
She has a special memory associated with them.

1221
01:04:12,860 --> 01:04:20,160
The city of Ikeda in Tokushima prefecture where the dad who loves mountains was brought up.

1222
01:04:20,150 --> 01:04:25,620
The dad purchased a house with a nice view.

1223
01:04:25,610 --> 01:04:27,990
The wall is full of family pictures.

1224
01:04:27,980 --> 01:04:32,210
When the kids were smaller or that time they visited Okinawa.

1225
01:04:32,200 --> 01:04:37,640
In the four years of their marriage the wall has already filled up.

1226
01:04:37,630 --> 01:04:42,400
But the dad is no longer with us.

1227
01:04:42,390 --> 01:04:45,020
He died 2 years ago.

1228
01:04:46,100 --> 01:04:51,780
He left for his lumberjack job as usual on that day.

1229
01:04:51,420 --> 01:04:56,410
Location of the accident

1230
01:04:51,770 --> 01:04:55,610
But a tree suddenly fell on him.

1231
01:04:57,470 --> 01:05:06,820
When papa died I cried so much.
The two of us did. Every evening.

1232
01:05:06,810 --> 01:05:15,210
It was just after the little brother was born. The one who was always by his mothers side was the 2 year old brother.

1233
01:05:15,200 --> 01:05:21,460
It hit me like a switch. I don't remember when.
Suddenly I just decided not to cry anymore.

1234
01:05:21,450 --> 01:05:26,930
I won't cry anymore. Won't cry
in front of the kids anymore. Not again.

1235
01:05:26,920 --> 01:05:34,390
But on that day I decided that while there are dads and mothers I need to fulfill both of those roles.

1236
01:05:34,680 --> 01:05:40,740
The big brother behaves properly after having watched his mother from the sidelines.

1237
01:05:40,730 --> 01:05:47,030
When the little brother becomes unmanageable the one to take the reins is the big brother.

1238
01:05:47,020 --> 01:05:52,770
It's like he has taken the responsibility of his father.

1239
01:05:52,760 --> 01:05:56,400
I rely on the big brother.

1240
01:05:57,870 --> 01:06:02,090
The big brother loves to make his mother happy.

1241
01:06:02,960 --> 01:06:08,410
His father loved tulips.
Just as he loved nature.

1242
01:06:08,400 --> 01:06:12,710
So for the errand they've decided to get some flowers for him.

1243
01:06:12,700 --> 01:06:16,490
Kanaya at 2 years and four months still doesn't talk.

1244
01:06:16,480 --> 01:06:20,560
But he's fine with his brother on his side.

1245
01:06:20,550 --> 01:06:22,210
He depends on him.

1246
01:06:22,200 --> 01:06:24,860
The bus which is running late finally came.

1247
01:06:24,850 --> 01:06:26,050
It came.

1248
01:06:27,260 --> 01:06:29,010
Stop, please stop.

1249
01:06:29,000 --> 01:06:30,900
He noticed the brothers hands.

1250
01:06:29,840 --> 01:06:31,560
What a relief.

1251
01:06:31,950 --> 01:06:38,720
What a relief. This bus comes once every 2 hours.

1252
01:06:38,710 --> 01:06:40,380
They rode it.

1253
01:06:40,370 --> 01:06:44,770
They rode it. It's hard to see because of the tinted windows.

1254
01:06:44,760 --> 01:06:47,540
The windows on the bus are tinted.

1255
01:06:47,530 --> 01:06:53,110
The cameraman rehearsed this shot with the bus that passed 2 hours earlier and has waited since then.

1256
01:06:53,100 --> 01:06:57,270
Eh? With this type of windows we can't look inside.

1257
01:06:55,920 --> 01:06:57,690
Can't see a thing.

1258
01:06:57,680 --> 01:06:59,810
The cameraman on the bus.

1259
01:06:59,800 --> 01:07:05,760
Big brother looks serious.
And with his bright red cheeks.

1260
01:07:05,940 --> 01:07:08,670
What about the youngest of them?

1261
01:07:09,340 --> 01:07:15,670
Getting sleepy from the ride but he has nothing to worry about. Since his brother is by his side.

1262
01:07:17,270 --> 01:07:20,910
Protect him, big brother.

1263
01:07:22,460 --> 01:07:23,590
He's falling asleep.

1264
01:07:24,430 --> 01:07:30,070
The bus has arrived at the terminal.
This is also where they should catch it on the way back.

1265
01:07:30,060 --> 01:07:32,490
He's fast asleep.

1266
01:07:32,480 --> 01:07:39,620
We are getting off, Kanaya. You can't sleep here.

1267
01:07:39,610 --> 01:07:45,430
They've received the bus fare separately.
Oh no, this is for the flowers.

1268
01:07:45,420 --> 01:07:47,860
Oh no, he took out the 1000 yen bill.

1269
01:07:47,850 --> 01:07:50,850
Now the purse is full of spare change.

1270
01:07:52,970 --> 01:07:55,270
Let's walk to the flower shop.

1271
01:07:55,260 --> 01:07:58,700
Yes, they have to walk to the flower shop.

1272
01:07:58,690 --> 01:08:03,570
The road is straight forward.
They always come by car here with their mother.

1273
01:08:03,560 --> 01:08:07,160
They might not notice when going by car
but the street is on a slope.

1274
01:08:07,150 --> 01:08:10,990
Which they have to ascend on the way back.

1275
01:08:10,980 --> 01:08:16,040
Furthermore it takes about 2 hours to go there and back.
There's no time to roam around.

1276
01:08:14,780 --> 01:08:16,040
Better hurry.

1277
01:08:16,030 --> 01:08:20,870
They have to walk in line
since the pavement is narrow.

1278
01:08:20,860 --> 01:08:23,470
He's properly following his big brother.

1279
01:08:23,460 --> 01:08:27,580
Kanaya doesn't speak but he's good on his feet.

1280
01:08:27,850 --> 01:08:29,000
Hole.

1281
01:08:28,990 --> 01:08:29,930
Hole?

1282
01:08:30,390 --> 01:08:34,520
They are taught to walk in the line
where the holes are by their mother.

1283
01:08:34,510 --> 01:08:38,660
His brother is checking if Kanaya is walking properly.

1284
01:08:40,060 --> 01:08:44,230
After the check they can continue.

1285
01:08:41,800 --> 01:08:44,230
Pushed him.

1286
01:08:44,670 --> 01:08:55,330
But their speeds are completely different.
Little brother who can't speak a word wants to call out "wait".

1287
01:08:55,320 --> 01:08:58,010
Brobro.

1288
01:08:58,000 --> 01:09:03,640
You've become capable of saying "brobro", Kanaya?

1289
01:09:04,510 --> 01:09:09,000
His first words and they were "brobro".

1290
01:09:08,990 --> 01:09:11,480
A rapid development on this errand.

1291
01:09:11,470 --> 01:09:17,020
When you follow your brother with all your might you grow strong.

1292
01:09:18,230 --> 01:09:19,330
Hand.

1293
01:09:19,320 --> 01:09:20,680
Hand hand.

1294
01:09:20,670 --> 01:09:22,550
He even said "hands".

1295
01:09:23,020 --> 01:09:26,200
Even at home there are times
when he doesn't want to hold hands.

1296
01:09:26,190 --> 01:09:30,840
But today is an errand and his brother is his new father-figure.

1297
01:09:30,830 --> 01:09:33,030
Ah, it's over there.

1298
01:09:33,020 --> 01:09:35,510
They can see the flower shop.

1299
01:09:37,010 --> 01:09:42,070
Their father would often stop by
to purchase flowers for his wife.

1300
01:09:42,060 --> 01:09:46,360
He would get the flowers of the season every week.

1301
01:09:46,350 --> 01:09:52,150
Their father who worked in the mountain-side especially prefered bigleaf hydrangea.

1302
01:09:52,140 --> 01:09:56,200
Even their mother comes here every week.

1303
01:09:55,900 --> 01:09:57,890
The shop owner is an acquaintance.

1304
01:09:57,880 --> 01:10:00,230
Welcome.

1305
01:10:00,390 --> 01:10:01,650
Where's mom?

1306
01:10:01,640 --> 01:10:03,850
She's at home.

1307
01:10:03,840 --> 01:10:10,090
Did you and your brother come alone?
What a smart kid.

1308
01:10:08,280 --> 01:10:10,310
What did you come here to buy?

1309
01:10:10,300 --> 01:10:11,220
Flowers.

1310
01:10:11,210 --> 01:10:12,290
For dad?

1311
01:10:12,280 --> 01:10:16,540
Everyone remembers that his dad used to come here.

1312
01:10:16,530 --> 01:10:21,440
Carnations, lillies and sunflowers.
They have all kinds of flowers.

1313
01:10:21,430 --> 01:10:25,140
The shop owner is making them a bouquet.

1314
01:10:25,130 --> 01:10:27,270
Is there any color you would like to add?

1315
01:10:27,520 --> 01:10:28,360
Red.

1316
01:10:28,350 --> 01:10:30,180
Red, right?

1317
01:10:30,280 --> 01:10:31,090
Like this.

1318
01:10:31,080 --> 01:10:35,180
I see. Adding red has made is livelier.

1319
01:10:35,260 --> 01:10:38,100
The big brother has a nice taste.

1320
01:10:38,090 --> 01:10:41,960
Please add a pink ribbon for mom.

1321
01:10:41,950 --> 01:10:43,480
For mom, right?

1322
01:10:43,470 --> 01:10:47,220
That's what his father used to do too.

1323
01:10:47,210 --> 01:10:48,840
This flower?

1324
01:10:48,830 --> 01:10:52,130
He decided without any hesitation.

1325
01:10:48,830 --> 01:10:52,130
Will you give this to your mother?

1326
01:10:52,120 --> 01:10:53,880
I will wrap it for you.

1327
01:10:53,870 --> 01:10:56,190
Yellow is his little brothers favorite color.

1328
01:10:56,180 --> 01:10:57,740
Cute.

1329
01:10:57,730 --> 01:10:59,290
Aren't they?

1330
01:11:00,860 --> 01:11:03,370
Since they are a present.

1331
01:11:03,360 --> 01:11:08,680
The ones he chose were alstroemeria.
Also called Lily of the Incas.

1332
01:11:08,670 --> 01:11:12,100
The old man is even giving him a card to write on.

1333
01:11:12,090 --> 01:11:14,650
He can even write?

1334
01:11:12,780 --> 01:11:15,270
- He can write?
- That's amazing.

1335
01:11:15,440 --> 01:11:17,110
What is he writing?

1336
01:11:16,380 --> 01:11:17,760
- What is this?
- No clue.

1337
01:11:17,360 --> 01:11:19,060
What are you writing?

1338
01:11:19,050 --> 01:11:21,060
Thank you.

1339
01:11:21,620 --> 01:11:23,480
I can write it for you.

1340
01:11:23,470 --> 01:11:24,720
It said thank you?

1341
01:11:25,150 --> 01:11:28,330
The man wrote thanks to the mother.

1342
01:11:28,320 --> 01:11:29,410
Dad.

1343
01:11:29,400 --> 01:11:30,790
Also to your dad?

1344
01:11:30,780 --> 01:11:33,510
And thanks to his little brother too.

1345
01:11:33,500 --> 01:11:35,250
Hand it over both of you.

1346
01:11:35,240 --> 01:11:37,430
Thank you.

1347
01:11:36,570 --> 01:11:37,430
you.

1348
01:11:37,420 --> 01:11:38,620
Take care.

1349
01:11:38,610 --> 01:11:40,580
Be back tomorrow.

1350
01:11:40,570 --> 01:11:42,920
Back tomorrow?

1351
01:11:43,170 --> 01:11:48,530
There's only an hour left before the bus departs.
And they have to purchase some things first.

1352
01:11:48,520 --> 01:11:54,930
The supermarket is next to the bus terminal.
What they are getting is coffee and udon noodles.

1353
01:11:54,920 --> 01:11:57,010
Hurry up, Kanaya.

1354
01:11:57,000 --> 01:11:58,550
Hurry.

1355
01:11:58,540 --> 01:12:01,160
They've started going up the hill.

1356
01:12:01,150 --> 01:12:03,160
Even if he is asked to hurry...

1357
01:12:04,110 --> 01:12:06,180
Kanaya.

1358
01:12:06,170 --> 01:12:10,870
They haven't noticed when going by car
but it's pretty steep.

1359
01:12:10,860 --> 01:12:12,500
This way.

1360
01:12:12,490 --> 01:12:15,050
This won't work.

1361
01:12:13,370 --> 01:12:14,840
Do your best.

1362
01:12:15,040 --> 01:12:17,750
They won't make it at this pace.

1363
01:12:17,740 --> 01:12:20,830
Kanaya.

1364
01:12:20,820 --> 01:12:23,430
Give it all you got.

1365
01:12:23,420 --> 01:12:30,600
No matter how much you shout for this 2 year old who just spoke his first words he doesn't know what "hurry" means.

1366
01:12:30,590 --> 01:12:33,990
But he is properly walking above the holes.

1367
01:12:33,240 --> 01:12:34,010
I see.

1368
01:12:33,870 --> 01:12:35,050
Adhering to the rule

1369
01:12:35,040 --> 01:12:37,240
This way he won't walk into the street.

1370
01:12:37,230 --> 01:12:41,850
His brother has decided to leave him behind.

1371
01:12:40,110 --> 01:12:41,850
Is that okay?

1372
01:12:41,840 --> 01:12:44,710
I will go by myself.

1373
01:12:44,700 --> 01:12:51,870
They won't make it at this pace.
He has decided to go shopping ahead of his little brother.

1374
01:12:51,860 --> 01:12:55,620
Over the holes. Over the holes.

1375
01:12:55,610 --> 01:12:57,800
The supermarket is within sight.

1376
01:12:58,720 --> 01:12:59,880
I'm sweating.

1377
01:12:59,870 --> 01:13:02,190
The road is flat here.

1378
01:13:02,230 --> 01:13:04,440
The supermarket is right there.

1379
01:13:04,430 --> 01:13:07,930
This is a large-sized supermarket.

1380
01:13:07,920 --> 01:13:10,740
At this moment how is Kanaya doing?

1381
01:13:10,730 --> 01:13:17,130
With two traffic lights ahead of him if he walks
above the holes he will reach up with his brother.

1382
01:13:14,300 --> 01:13:15,130
Move forward.

1383
01:13:17,800 --> 01:13:24,330
But there's only 30 minutes before the bus leaves.
Will they make it?

1384
01:13:19,720 --> 01:13:20,450
Oh no.

1385
01:13:24,320 --> 01:13:26,180
The big brother has arrived.

1386
01:13:26,170 --> 01:13:28,180
I would like some coffee.

1387
01:13:28,170 --> 01:13:29,810
Concentrated coffee?

1388
01:13:29,800 --> 01:13:33,960
He found the coffee at the beverage aisle.

1389
01:13:33,950 --> 01:13:35,960
Is your mother looking for this?

1390
01:13:35,950 --> 01:13:38,700
Only for dad.

1391
01:13:35,950 --> 01:13:38,700
Only for dad?

1392
01:13:38,690 --> 01:13:40,870
Smokes and coffee reminds them of dad.

1393
01:13:42,220 --> 01:13:47,050
And there must also be some udon here.

1394
01:13:47,040 --> 01:13:50,370
He remembers well always getting these with his mother.

1395
01:13:50,360 --> 01:13:52,370
His little brother loves udon.

1396
01:13:56,120 --> 01:13:57,320
Heavy.

1397
01:13:57,310 --> 01:14:00,500
Is it really that heavy?

1398
01:14:00,490 --> 01:14:01,780
I made it.

1399
01:14:02,760 --> 01:14:04,740
He found all he needs.

1400
01:14:04,730 --> 01:14:07,430
I wonder how Kanaya is doing.

1401
01:14:08,230 --> 01:14:12,450
He was told to walk on the bumpy lines after the holes.

1402
01:14:11,520 --> 01:14:12,440
I see.

1403
01:14:12,430 --> 01:14:14,710
The supermarket is within sight.

1404
01:14:13,120 --> 01:14:14,000
Great.

1405
01:14:13,600 --> 01:14:14,710
It's straight ahead.

1406
01:14:14,700 --> 01:14:16,710
Where's brobro?

1407
01:14:17,130 --> 01:14:19,810
Brobro is still in the supermarket.

1408
01:14:19,800 --> 01:14:22,900
Putting all the items in the backpack.

1409
01:14:22,890 --> 01:14:25,280
Thank you very much.

1410
01:14:25,270 --> 01:14:27,810
Time will run out if you don't hurry.

1411
01:14:27,800 --> 01:14:30,090
- Better hurry.
- Hurry.

1412
01:14:30,120 --> 01:14:34,230
It's 10 minutes to and people have started gathering.

1413
01:14:34,220 --> 01:14:36,460
Where's Kanaya.

1414
01:14:36,580 --> 01:14:42,390
He believes Kanaya has kept walking far ahead.

1415
01:14:42,380 --> 01:14:44,760
He should be around here.

1416
01:14:44,750 --> 01:14:46,370
And at that time.

1417
01:14:46,360 --> 01:14:48,470
Brobro.

1418
01:14:48,460 --> 01:14:50,210
It's Kanaya.

1419
01:14:51,000 --> 01:14:52,290
He's calling.

1420
01:14:52,280 --> 01:14:55,140
Where are you? Where are you?

1421
01:14:53,830 --> 01:14:54,790
Where?

1422
01:14:55,160 --> 01:14:57,590
Kanaya.

1423
01:14:57,580 --> 01:14:58,970
Brobro.

1424
01:15:00,110 --> 01:15:02,420
Found him.

1425
01:15:02,410 --> 01:15:06,410
Just like his brother believed.

1426
01:15:04,660 --> 01:15:06,360
Amazing.

1427
01:15:06,390 --> 01:15:08,430
Brobro.

1428
01:15:08,420 --> 01:15:11,400
Isn't it nice that he can say brobro now.

1429
01:15:11,390 --> 01:15:15,910
I got coffee and udon.

1430
01:15:14,460 --> 01:15:15,910
He's talking normally to him.

1431
01:15:15,900 --> 01:15:17,740
Udon and coffee.

1432
01:15:20,430 --> 01:15:25,280
Come to the bus stop.

1433
01:15:25,940 --> 01:15:28,930
The little brother is amazing.

1434
01:15:30,700 --> 01:15:34,890
Kanaya, do your best.

1435
01:15:34,880 --> 01:15:36,090
Amazing.

1436
01:15:35,760 --> 01:15:41,290
Finally leaving the bumpy lines they get together for an emotional meet up.

1437
01:15:41,280 --> 01:15:42,700
Kanaya.

1438
01:15:42,890 --> 01:15:46,640
He really did his best not to cry.

1439
01:15:44,510 --> 01:15:46,520
Remarkable.

1440
01:15:46,760 --> 01:15:49,750
What? Aren't we going to hold hands?

1441
01:15:49,810 --> 01:15:51,560
He clearly put out his hands.

1442
01:15:50,830 --> 01:15:56,630
Since he made it this far by himself he wants his brother to finish on his own. Like a father.

1443
01:15:56,650 --> 01:16:01,090
They made it just in time with 5 minutes to spare.

1444
01:15:59,690 --> 01:16:01,850
They gave it their all.

1445
01:16:06,190 --> 01:16:15,210
The bus home doesn't have tinted windows.
With this we should be able to see the two from outside.

1446
01:16:16,760 --> 01:16:23,340
Back to the cameraman who waited for over 2 hours
he put a lot of care into getting a glimpse of the two.

1447
01:16:17,100 --> 01:16:22,470
Original Song:
藤田麻衣子 - 素敵なことがあなたを待っている

1448
01:16:21,820 --> 01:16:23,590
Do you best.

1449
01:16:23,580 --> 01:16:27,100
Where are they? Huh, they aren't there?

1450
01:16:27,460 --> 01:16:33,190
Can't see them cause they are asleep.
Even big brother.

1451
01:16:33,180 --> 01:16:36,450
From all the stress surrounding the trip.

1452
01:16:39,790 --> 01:16:45,470
In the end we didn't get a single glimpse of them going either of the directions.

1453
01:16:45,460 --> 01:16:51,050
It's the bus stop after crossing the river.
If they don't wake up they will go all the way to the mountains.

1454
01:16:52,930 --> 01:16:57,490
Their mother is waiting at the bus stop.

1455
01:16:57,480 --> 01:17:01,150
She's wondering if they made it to the bus.

1456
01:17:02,510 --> 01:17:06,290
They did.

1457
01:17:04,540 --> 01:17:06,280
Sound asleep.

1458
01:17:07,000 --> 01:17:09,470
It's coming.

1459
01:17:20,030 --> 01:17:21,960
- Are there any kids on board?
- Yes.

1460
01:17:21,950 --> 01:17:23,950
- Can I take a look?
- You're welcome.

1461
01:17:23,940 --> 01:17:27,320
- Must be asleep.
- I bet they are.

1462
01:17:27,850 --> 01:17:29,680
There they are.

1463
01:17:30,180 --> 01:17:33,620
Could you please wait a little bit longer?

1464
01:17:33,610 --> 01:17:36,360
Kanaya who kept walking above the holes.

1465
01:17:36,810 --> 01:17:38,150
Shuuya.

1466
01:17:38,140 --> 01:17:40,390
Shuuya who has become brobro.

1467
01:17:40,380 --> 01:17:42,190
You've arrived.

1468
01:17:41,050 --> 01:17:42,490
He gave it all he had.

1469
01:17:42,480 --> 01:17:44,490
He looks so surprised.

1470
01:17:44,920 --> 01:17:48,050
Mom, did you come all the way to get us?

1471
01:17:48,040 --> 01:17:54,030
Exactly 280 yen. Thank you for taking care of us. Ah, and I'm sorry it dragged out.

1472
01:17:54,020 --> 01:17:56,730
She also thanks the other riders.

1473
01:18:01,500 --> 01:18:03,930
Hold up. It wasn't just a dream?

1474
01:18:04,840 --> 01:18:07,150
I really did go on an errand.

1475
01:18:07,140 --> 01:18:10,340
It's fine. He even brought proof.

1476
01:18:12,220 --> 01:18:18,150
Amazing. Are these flowers for dad?
And are these for mom?

1477
01:18:18,140 --> 01:18:20,240
Why did you write here?

1478
01:18:20,230 --> 01:18:23,370
Just to make you happy.

1479
01:18:23,360 --> 01:18:24,810
Thank you very much.

1480
01:18:24,800 --> 01:18:32,790
I wrote it to you, mom. And also for dad.

1481
01:18:24,800 --> 01:18:32,790
Thank you. I saw it. Also for dad.

1482
01:18:32,780 --> 01:18:37,260
Dad, they've become able to purchase flowers.

1483
01:18:37,250 --> 01:18:39,170
Let's eat udon with broth.

1484
01:18:39,160 --> 01:18:42,340
Her laughter has returned to her voice.

1485
01:18:42,330 --> 01:18:43,710
Here you go.

1486
01:18:43,700 --> 01:18:49,060
And Kanaya has started speaking. He said "brobro".

1487
01:18:49,050 --> 01:18:53,010
As usual next to their father you find flowers and coffee.

1488
01:18:53,000 --> 01:18:58,910
Father, let's depend on big brother to bring you flowers.

1489
01:18:59,500 --> 01:19:06,250
Father lives on inside both of Shuuya and Kanaya.

1490
01:19:26,370 --> 01:19:30,200
- What a perfect errand.
- That's true.

1491
01:19:30,190 --> 01:19:36,340
At the beginning when the mother was standing strong I thought what a hard mother.

1492
01:19:36,330 --> 01:19:37,270
Well said.

1493
01:19:37,260 --> 01:19:45,870
I thought what a hard-disciplining mother
but then it turned out that she was kind.

1494
01:19:45,860 --> 01:19:51,990
I cried a lot. Especially considering the younger is 2 years old and staying by his brothers side.

1495
01:19:51,980 --> 01:19:58,090
I think that boys have a strong feeling towards wanting to protect their mother.

1496
01:19:58,080 --> 01:20:01,790
Such as wanting to be helpful to their mother.

1497
01:20:01,780 --> 01:20:08,610
And especially when there is a younger brother in play the older becomes aware of the role the play.

1498
01:20:08,600 --> 01:20:10,660
It was irresistible.

1499
01:20:10,650 --> 01:20:14,130
There was a big brother here who was crying a lot.

1500
01:20:12,540 --> 01:20:14,130
Wailing.

1501
01:20:14,120 --> 01:20:20,040
- I'm sorry. I just couldn't keep it in.
- I kept hearing "uuh uuh" next to me.

1502
01:20:20,030 --> 01:20:24,930
Seeing Shuuya was almost like watching myself.

1503
01:20:24,920 --> 01:20:25,940
Well brobro.

1504
01:20:25,930 --> 01:20:27,960
Don't be dumb.

1505
01:20:27,950 --> 01:20:31,970
But this is the first time I've been able to say it. Brobro.

1506
01:20:33,110 --> 01:20:36,360
- It's your first time saying it? I see.
- Brobro. Exactly.

1507
01:20:36,350 --> 01:20:40,090
Next will be our youngest to go on an errand for this time.

1508
01:20:40,080 --> 01:20:43,570
A small town called Nishiiya in the mountains of Shikoku.

1509
01:20:43,560 --> 01:20:47,950
A 2 year old and 2 months old will go on an errand.

1510
01:20:47,940 --> 01:20:56,120
If you go there you will notice that hardly any cars drive on the road. It's a very quiet place.

1511
01:20:56,110 --> 01:20:58,370
This is the only shop here.

1512
01:20:58,360 --> 01:21:05,290
Food, alcohol, soy sauce, tissues and even emergency drugs are available here.

1513
01:21:05,280 --> 01:21:07,290
The towns convenience store.

1514
01:21:08,010 --> 01:21:10,450
It's been in operation for 87 years.

1515
01:21:10,440 --> 01:21:18,600
This shop hasn't changed and people love it for it.
The ones running it are the Kitas.

1516
01:21:18,590 --> 01:21:25,930
Since this place is so safe and our kid is capable her mother has asked us to film the errand.

1517
01:21:28,280 --> 01:21:30,400
Say "welcome".

1518
01:21:31,590 --> 01:21:34,580
- No way.
- This kid?
- She's so small.

1519
01:21:33,560 --> 01:21:36,450
Isn't she just a toddler?

1520
01:21:34,870 --> 01:21:36,440
Can this kid do it?

1521
01:21:36,430 --> 01:21:38,060
Bread please.

1522
01:21:38,050 --> 01:21:41,450
We don't meet the children until the day of shooting.

1523
01:21:38,790 --> 01:21:43,140
Yumemi

1524
01:21:41,440 --> 01:21:45,380
Our program aims not to prefer any children over others.

1525
01:21:45,370 --> 01:21:48,660
Today we have Anpan bread.

1526
01:21:48,650 --> 01:21:50,490
She can talk.

1527
01:21:50,480 --> 01:21:53,900
Is it really this kid?
Not an older sister or something?

1528
01:21:53,890 --> 01:21:55,830
We called out the mother.

1529
01:21:57,500 --> 01:22:00,610
Is that kid Yumemi?

1530
01:22:01,280 --> 01:22:02,660
- Is it Yume?
- It's Yume.

1531
01:22:02,650 --> 01:22:05,090
- Isn't she too small?
- She's small?

1532
01:22:05,080 --> 01:22:09,240
- Can she go on an errand?
- An errand? Yeah, she's in a good mood today.

1533
01:22:09,230 --> 01:22:13,050
- Mood? Are you confident?
- Yes.

1534
01:22:13,040 --> 01:22:21,080
When I told her to go to the swings she ran towards it alone.

1535
01:22:21,070 --> 01:22:29,450
So it's really this kid. Since the 16 staffers came all the way from Tokyo let's just see how it plays out.

1536
01:22:29,440 --> 01:22:31,940
Poi.

1537
01:22:31,930 --> 01:22:33,330
She's cleaning up.

1538
01:22:33,320 --> 01:22:37,280
So many toys. The bag is going to be full.

1539
01:22:37,270 --> 01:22:40,610
Can it all fit in?

1540
01:22:37,270 --> 01:22:40,610
Yeah, this bag might not be enough.

1541
01:22:39,940 --> 01:22:41,870
She can conversate.

1542
01:22:40,600 --> 01:22:43,010
She understands quantities.

1543
01:22:43,000 --> 01:22:48,110
It won't be able to close.

1544
01:22:43,000 --> 01:22:48,110
Yeah, it won't. Do we have another bag?

1545
01:22:48,100 --> 01:22:51,000
Let's have a look if we do.

1546
01:22:51,580 --> 01:22:55,090
Will she be able to spot the right item.

1547
01:22:55,470 --> 01:22:57,880
There ain't one.

1548
01:22:57,030 --> 01:22:58,670
Ain't one?

1549
01:22:58,170 --> 01:23:01,240
We've probably run out.

1550
01:23:01,390 --> 01:23:02,550
What to do?

1551
01:23:02,540 --> 01:23:06,640
Even if asked such a question.
She's holding the remote to the AC.

1552
01:23:06,630 --> 01:23:09,360
Hello, Yu.

1553
01:23:06,630 --> 01:23:09,360
What?

1554
01:23:09,350 --> 01:23:11,880
I have a request to make.

1555
01:23:11,870 --> 01:23:17,210
Huh?

1556
01:23:11,870 --> 01:23:17,210
We've run out of bags.

1557
01:23:17,200 --> 01:23:24,650
But I'm waiting for the electrician and can't leave home. Wonder who can purchase them instead.

1558
01:23:24,640 --> 01:23:26,950
Yume will go buy them.

1559
01:23:26,940 --> 01:23:30,450
Will you buy them? Really?

1560
01:23:26,940 --> 01:23:30,450
Yes.

1561
01:23:30,440 --> 01:23:32,980
It's at the old man Kita's place.

1562
01:23:30,440 --> 01:23:32,980
Okay.

1563
01:23:32,970 --> 01:23:37,060
Pass the school, go up the hill and then buy it.
Are you up for it?

1564
01:23:37,050 --> 01:23:37,930
Yes.

1565
01:23:37,920 --> 01:23:41,300
A bag? Really?

1566
01:23:37,920 --> 01:23:41,300
Yes.

1567
01:23:41,290 --> 01:23:43,160
Can I really make this request?

1568
01:23:41,290 --> 01:23:43,160
Yes.

1569
01:23:43,150 --> 01:23:44,450
For real?

1570
01:23:45,220 --> 01:23:47,140
I have another request.

1571
01:23:47,130 --> 01:23:48,920
Another request?

1572
01:23:48,910 --> 01:23:50,230
I want this.

1573
01:23:50,220 --> 01:23:51,850
A toy egg.

1574
01:23:51,840 --> 01:23:54,100
It's an egg.

1575
01:23:51,840 --> 01:23:54,100
What's this?

1576
01:23:54,090 --> 01:23:59,570
I would also like eggs for todays lunch since we've run out. Can you do it?

1577
01:23:59,560 --> 01:24:01,070
Yes, of course.

1578
01:24:01,060 --> 01:24:04,680
It's the usual route to the shop.

1579
01:24:04,670 --> 01:24:09,410
She was asked to get bags and eggs.

1580
01:24:09,400 --> 01:24:11,430
We've left a camera on the floor.

1581
01:24:11,420 --> 01:24:13,890
Mom, eggs... wait what's that?

1582
01:24:13,880 --> 01:24:15,250
Immediately spotted it.

1583
01:24:15,040 --> 01:24:16,390
Amazing.

1584
01:24:15,240 --> 01:24:19,450
I guess it was left by a construction worker.

1585
01:24:15,240 --> 01:24:19,450
What is it?

1586
01:24:19,450 --> 01:24:20,680
Be careful.

1587
01:24:20,670 --> 01:24:23,300
Departure.

1588
01:24:20,670 --> 01:24:23,300
Yes, departing.

1589
01:24:23,290 --> 01:24:26,460
She has to sit on each step to go down the stairs.

1590
01:24:26,570 --> 01:24:30,480
Each step requires this much effort.

1591
01:24:30,470 --> 01:24:32,740
Take care.

1592
01:24:32,730 --> 01:24:34,690
Heading off.

1593
01:24:35,010 --> 01:24:39,210
The mother is a former Japanese teacher.
A real pro in education.

1594
01:24:39,200 --> 01:24:44,660
A besides bringing up a kid she's already brought up two older sisters.

1595
01:24:44,660 --> 01:24:52,960
And she has taught Yumemi that she can accomplish anything. She can even talk really well.

1596
01:24:56,330 --> 01:24:58,230
Wait, she stopped.

1597
01:24:58,220 --> 01:25:02,490
Sticking to the wall and checking out her surroundings.

1598
01:25:02,480 --> 01:25:04,770
Will she go back now?

1599
01:25:04,800 --> 01:25:06,870
She started moving.

1600
01:25:06,860 --> 01:25:09,990
Oh, she's going out after all.

1601
01:25:10,160 --> 01:25:13,990
She's cautious.

1602
01:25:14,680 --> 01:25:17,280
Yumemi is careful.

1603
01:25:21,000 --> 01:25:24,270
She has started spinning.

1604
01:25:24,260 --> 01:25:26,410
Spinning one round.

1605
01:25:27,380 --> 01:25:30,200
Then another.

1606
01:25:33,020 --> 01:25:34,130
Mama.

1607
01:25:34,120 --> 01:25:38,070
Mama? Will she go back home?

1608
01:25:34,780 --> 01:25:36,770
That makes sense.

1609
01:25:42,370 --> 01:25:44,710
She disappeared.

1610
01:25:56,950 --> 01:25:58,380
Where to?

1611
01:25:57,820 --> 01:26:02,520
She started climbing the hill.
This road leads to the shop.

1612
01:26:02,510 --> 01:26:08,010
She's putting all her power
into climbing the 13 degree slope.

1613
01:26:08,000 --> 01:26:09,930
She stopped.

1614
01:26:11,130 --> 01:26:12,380
It's her mama.

1615
01:26:12,370 --> 01:26:14,620
Ah, she's watching her.

1616
01:26:12,370 --> 01:26:14,620
Do your best.

1617
01:26:14,640 --> 01:26:17,140
Is she crying?

1618
01:26:17,950 --> 01:26:19,930
Do your best.

1619
01:26:20,130 --> 01:26:25,170
Do your best. Off you go.

1620
01:26:20,130 --> 01:26:25,170
The one crying is the mama.

1621
01:26:25,160 --> 01:26:26,890
Yumemi isn't crying.

1622
01:26:28,860 --> 01:26:30,710
Do your best.

1623
01:26:31,810 --> 01:26:34,720
One two. One two.

1624
01:26:35,330 --> 01:26:36,710
One two.

1625
01:26:36,700 --> 01:26:39,820
She suddenly turned her back and started picking her nose.

1626
01:26:39,810 --> 01:26:41,580
Departure.

1627
01:26:39,810 --> 01:26:41,580
Do your best.

1628
01:26:41,570 --> 01:26:45,360
Her mom isn't there to stop her from picking her nose.

1629
01:26:47,160 --> 01:26:51,810
She's really going for it.
We might've underestimated her.

1630
01:26:51,800 --> 01:26:54,630
Still going up the hill.

1631
01:26:55,050 --> 01:27:01,930
She stopped again.
Looking back at her home.

1632
01:27:04,510 --> 01:27:08,440
She's making a grimace.
Is she going to cry?

1633
01:27:08,430 --> 01:27:13,500
Her seeking pose.

1634
01:27:08,430 --> 01:27:13,500
Where is mama?

1635
01:27:13,490 --> 01:27:17,830
Her shouting out pose.

1636
01:27:13,490 --> 01:27:17,830
Mama.

1637
01:27:18,700 --> 01:27:20,280
She's so cute.

1638
01:27:20,750 --> 01:27:22,400
Mama.

1639
01:27:22,390 --> 01:27:26,180
All that searching and shouting out but mama isn't there.

1640
01:27:26,170 --> 01:27:28,370
She keeps searching.

1641
01:27:28,360 --> 01:27:33,510
This is her thinking pose.

1642
01:27:28,360 --> 01:27:33,510
What should I do. Mama...

1643
01:27:33,540 --> 01:27:35,890
She can't go home.

1644
01:27:37,420 --> 01:27:40,180
She's really going for it?

1645
01:27:40,170 --> 01:27:43,090
She's hard to read.

1646
01:27:43,080 --> 01:27:49,070
Yumemi has reached the top of the hill
and is heading for the shop.

1647
01:27:53,340 --> 01:27:57,420
She's greeting our traffic patrol.

1648
01:27:53,440 --> 01:27:55,360
Hello.

1649
01:27:57,410 --> 01:28:02,830
It's straight ahead. The shop's
red banner is visible from here.

1650
01:28:02,820 --> 01:28:05,800
I can see it too.

1651
01:28:06,350 --> 01:28:10,930
She knows to walk on the edge of the street.

1652
01:28:11,870 --> 01:28:18,160
She's walking on the stone lids
like her mother taught her

1653
01:28:18,750 --> 01:28:20,500
She stopped.

1654
01:28:21,370 --> 01:28:25,410
Oh, the cameraman was in the way.
We are sorry.

1655
01:28:27,480 --> 01:28:29,650
Did she fall?

1656
01:28:29,640 --> 01:28:37,960
No, she's just sitting. This is the usual spot she has a break when she's out walking with her mother.

1657
01:28:37,950 --> 01:28:40,880
Is it someone she knows?

1658
01:28:40,870 --> 01:28:43,920
The old lady of the health clinic.

1659
01:28:44,030 --> 01:28:50,130
She greets them every time they go for a walk.
And she's even bringing candy?

1660
01:28:50,470 --> 01:28:52,760
Here you go.

1661
01:28:50,470 --> 01:28:52,760
Thank you.

1662
01:28:52,750 --> 01:28:54,470
She knows to properly say thanks.

1663
01:28:54,460 --> 01:28:55,770
Here you go.

1664
01:28:55,760 --> 01:29:00,100
Her cherished Madeleine cakes.

1665
01:28:58,380 --> 01:29:00,010
This is the best.

1666
01:29:00,490 --> 01:29:02,020
Delicious?

1667
01:29:02,760 --> 01:29:04,610
Bye bye.

1668
01:29:02,760 --> 01:29:04,610
Bye bye.

1669
01:29:04,600 --> 01:29:11,270
Not only candy but watching and protecting from afar that's the love that goes around in this town.

1670
01:29:08,680 --> 01:29:09,640
Amazing.

1671
01:29:11,260 --> 01:29:14,190
I will keep walking.

1672
01:29:15,470 --> 01:29:20,550
After a short rest and she's ready to walk again.

1673
01:29:21,200 --> 01:29:25,700
There's a Madelaine crumb left on her cheeck.

1674
01:29:25,690 --> 01:29:27,880
She has arrived at the shop.

1675
01:29:27,870 --> 01:29:36,490
She was asked to get bags and eggs.
Coming from outside it's quite dark inside.

1676
01:29:36,480 --> 01:29:39,170
She's intimidated by going in.

1677
01:29:39,860 --> 01:29:43,300
Did you come by yourself? How clever you are.

1678
01:29:43,290 --> 01:29:46,040
What do you need?

1679
01:29:47,460 --> 01:29:51,740
Eggs? How many?

1680
01:29:51,730 --> 01:29:54,170
Two? Two eggs?

1681
01:29:54,160 --> 01:29:57,380
No way she can carry two containers.

1682
01:29:56,450 --> 01:29:57,420
No way.

1683
01:29:57,410 --> 01:30:02,520
But the old lady took out two eggs and placed them in a bag for her.

1684
01:30:01,360 --> 01:30:02,600
How kind.

1685
01:30:02,590 --> 01:30:05,540
Cause that's how they were sold in the old days.

1686
01:30:05,530 --> 01:30:10,030
They will never be able to sell this container.

1687
01:30:10,020 --> 01:30:12,760
The 83 year old husband.

1688
01:30:12,750 --> 01:30:14,020
Good morning.

1689
01:30:14,010 --> 01:30:16,740
Enjoy the conversation with this tiny customer.

1690
01:30:16,730 --> 01:30:22,190
Did you come alone? How clever you are.

1691
01:30:22,220 --> 01:30:23,960
She's being praised.

1692
01:30:24,550 --> 01:30:26,900
Getting eggs?

1693
01:30:26,890 --> 01:30:30,750
Mama loves them.

1694
01:30:26,890 --> 01:30:30,750
She does?

1695
01:30:32,590 --> 01:30:37,720
And she was able to come by herself.

1696
01:30:32,590 --> 01:30:37,720
She's become more conversational since last.

1697
01:30:37,710 --> 01:30:41,110
It's a frog.

1698
01:30:37,710 --> 01:30:41,110
Thank you.

1699
01:30:41,850 --> 01:30:43,510
What is this thing?

1700
01:30:43,500 --> 01:30:45,420
What is this thing?

1701
01:30:45,410 --> 01:30:53,960
2 years and 2 months and an 83 year old.
Their conversation tempo oddly suit each other.

1702
01:30:56,010 --> 01:30:58,170
She's so excited.

1703
01:30:58,210 --> 01:31:00,940
Yumemi, you still haven't finished the errand.

1704
01:31:00,930 --> 01:31:04,600
Yumemi, are you only getting eggs?

1705
01:31:04,590 --> 01:31:08,920
She's searching for the forgotten thing in her mind.

1706
01:31:08,910 --> 01:31:11,330
What did mama ask you to buy?

1707
01:31:11,320 --> 01:31:13,490
And bags too.

1708
01:31:13,480 --> 01:31:15,170
She remembered.

1709
01:31:15,160 --> 01:31:22,920
When she's asked she will remember.
The old lady brings out the bags for her.

1710
01:31:22,910 --> 01:31:25,900
She also knows that she needs to pay.

1711
01:31:25,890 --> 01:31:26,810
Here.

1712
01:31:26,800 --> 01:31:30,980
Putting out 500 yen and getting her money back. She did it.

1713
01:31:30,970 --> 01:31:32,200
Praiseworthy.

1714
01:31:32,430 --> 01:31:34,530
I will give you this.

1715
01:31:34,520 --> 01:31:38,590
Thank you for saying thank you.

1716
01:31:34,520 --> 01:31:38,590
Thank you.

1717
01:31:38,580 --> 01:31:41,600
Thank you for saying thank you.

1718
01:31:41,590 --> 01:31:45,690
To avoid the eggs from cracking he puts them in her purse.

1719
01:31:45,690 --> 01:31:47,310
Safe.

1720
01:31:45,690 --> 01:31:48,250
Say your goodbyes.

1721
01:31:48,240 --> 01:31:51,600
Bye bye.

1722
01:31:48,240 --> 01:31:51,600
Bye bye.

1723
01:31:51,850 --> 01:31:54,420
She won't say goodbye?

1724
01:31:55,100 --> 01:31:57,500
Bye bye.

1725
01:31:55,100 --> 01:31:57,500
Bye bye.

1726
01:31:56,880 --> 01:31:58,840
Doesn't want to go home.

1727
01:31:57,490 --> 01:32:01,910
While they say goodbye the old man slowly moves away.

1728
01:32:01,900 --> 01:32:03,600
Will you be fine?

1729
01:32:04,730 --> 01:32:09,690
Yumemi finds it hard to go away.

1730
01:32:08,040 --> 01:32:11,610
-What a weird scene.

- Gramps be careful of things behind you.

1731
01:32:14,720 --> 01:32:15,800
What?

1732
01:32:15,790 --> 01:32:20,020
The old man is now much further away.

1733
01:32:19,100 --> 01:32:22,410
This is quite moving.

1734
01:32:26,200 --> 01:32:30,320
And with that the old man...

1735
01:32:30,310 --> 01:32:33,930
disappears from view.

1736
01:32:32,030 --> 01:32:34,450
Their bond is so strong.

1737
01:32:33,920 --> 01:32:38,890
Alright Yumemi, that was the goodbye.

1738
01:32:38,880 --> 01:32:43,590
After having so much fun she remembers her mother.

1739
01:32:43,580 --> 01:32:45,700
Mama.

1740
01:32:44,550 --> 01:32:46,900
That's right.

1741
01:32:49,340 --> 01:32:51,450
Do your best.

1742
01:32:54,590 --> 01:32:58,650
She's taking a secret shortcut through the school.

1743
01:32:58,640 --> 01:33:00,390
She knows about this?

1744
01:33:00,950 --> 01:33:02,530
Amazing.

1745
01:33:02,520 --> 01:33:06,280
She can see her home from here.

1746
01:33:07,660 --> 01:33:10,820
Her mother can see someone in pink clothes.

1747
01:33:10,810 --> 01:33:13,540
Yu.

1748
01:33:13,530 --> 01:33:15,250
Oh, mama.

1749
01:33:15,240 --> 01:33:16,410
Welcome home.

1750
01:33:16,400 --> 01:33:20,090
I'm home. I brought the bags.

1751
01:33:20,080 --> 01:33:24,290
Sorry for keeping you waiting.

1752
01:33:27,000 --> 01:33:32,810
Her mother thinks she forgot all about the eggs.

1753
01:33:37,110 --> 01:33:39,290
Thank you.

1754
01:33:38,520 --> 01:33:40,430
Amazing.

1755
01:33:40,420 --> 01:33:42,410
Both the kid and the mom are.

1756
01:33:42,400 --> 01:33:46,750
One by one she climbs the stairs with all her might.

1757
01:33:46,740 --> 01:33:49,290
The goal is her mothers arms.

1758
01:33:49,280 --> 01:33:53,740
Thank you for getting it for me. Welcome home.

1759
01:33:55,830 --> 01:33:59,830
I'm home.

1760
01:33:55,830 --> 01:33:59,830
Welcome home. Thank you.

1761
01:33:59,820 --> 01:34:02,490
You got the bags for me?

1762
01:34:02,480 --> 01:34:04,150
And you forgot the eggs?

1763
01:34:04,140 --> 01:34:05,860
Yes.

1764
01:34:05,890 --> 01:34:07,270
I have them.

1765
01:34:07,260 --> 01:34:09,960
You do? Where are they?

1766
01:34:09,950 --> 01:34:12,310
Are they in there?

1767
01:34:09,950 --> 01:34:12,310
Here.

1768
01:34:12,300 --> 01:34:14,520
Open.

1769
01:34:16,120 --> 01:34:17,680
What's this?

1770
01:34:19,890 --> 01:34:22,050
Amazing. Amazing.

1771
01:34:24,130 --> 01:34:26,040
These are the eggs.

1772
01:34:26,030 --> 01:34:29,550
They are in there and they didn't crack.

1773
01:34:29,540 --> 01:34:32,630
All thanks to the old man.

1774
01:34:32,620 --> 01:34:34,710
What will we make with these today?

1775
01:34:35,580 --> 01:34:37,380
Don't do that. They will break.

1776
01:34:37,370 --> 01:34:39,650
Since these are eggs.

1777
01:34:39,640 --> 01:34:41,130
Since these are eggs.

1778
01:34:41,120 --> 01:34:42,210
Do it.

1779
01:34:42,200 --> 01:34:45,170
Cracking the eggs for lunch.

1780
01:34:47,900 --> 01:34:48,780
You did it.

1781
01:34:48,770 --> 01:34:52,930
Made omurice with the eggs.

1782
01:34:51,650 --> 01:34:52,930
How nice.

1783
01:34:52,920 --> 01:34:54,930
Thanks for the meal.

1784
01:34:57,350 --> 01:35:01,540
Yu, the eggs you bought are delicious. They really are.

1785
01:35:01,550 --> 01:35:07,500
That's nice. But Yumemi isn't putting the eggs in her mouth.

1786
01:35:06,390 --> 01:35:07,930
Why?

1787
01:35:07,920 --> 01:35:09,880
No go.

1788
01:35:07,920 --> 01:35:09,880
Say aah.

1789
01:35:09,870 --> 01:35:11,630
Are you sure?

1790
01:35:11,620 --> 01:35:14,040
Here you go.

1791
01:35:11,620 --> 01:35:14,040
Mama can have it.

1792
01:35:14,530 --> 01:35:17,570
I want mama to enjoy it all.

1793
01:35:18,090 --> 01:35:21,930
Since she purchased it just for mama.

1794
01:35:23,290 --> 01:35:31,420
Todays noon nap. I wonder if she's
talking to the old man in her dreams.

1795
01:35:34,080 --> 01:35:35,460
The mother is amazing.

1796
01:35:35,450 --> 01:35:39,880
Isn't she? I've never seen a 2 year old like this.

1797
01:35:39,870 --> 01:35:42,100
The only one who cried was the mom.

1798
01:35:42,090 --> 01:35:46,970
The bye bye scene with the old man too.
The way he stepped back.

1799
01:35:46,960 --> 01:35:49,590
First time seeing an old guy doing the moonwalk.

1800
01:35:49,580 --> 01:35:51,140
Old guy moonwalk?

1801
01:35:51,130 --> 01:35:58,820
A 2 year 2 month year old who can talk this well while she can hardly descend stairs

1802
01:35:58,810 --> 01:36:02,170
both the mom and Yumemi are remarkable.

1803
01:36:02,160 --> 01:36:03,010
Right.

1804
01:36:03,000 --> 01:36:05,340
The "open" reveal was amazing as well.

1805
01:36:05,330 --> 01:36:09,520
It was like a magic show. Open. So cute.

1806
01:36:09,590 --> 01:36:12,790
I was worried about the eggs after all that hugging.

1807
01:36:12,780 --> 01:36:13,780
At the end yeah.

1808
01:36:13,770 --> 01:36:15,780
She was going like this.

1809
01:36:15,770 --> 01:36:17,970
And the "sorry for keeping you waiting".

1810
01:36:17,960 --> 01:36:24,010
Saying "sorry for keeping you waiting" and "open" such precious grown up words.

1811
01:36:24,000 --> 01:36:26,550
Sorry for keeping you waiting...

1812
01:36:26,540 --> 01:36:30,010
Sugiyama how are you feeling right now?

1813
01:36:30,000 --> 01:36:36,450
Watching the previous segments they are all full of drama

1814
01:36:30,000 --> 01:36:40,090
Sugiyamas kid will go on an errand now.

1815
01:36:36,440 --> 01:36:42,700
but after my son came back I kept asking how it was but he didn't tell me much.

1816
01:36:42,690 --> 01:36:47,030
so it will be my first time seeing it today.
I wonder how it will be.

1817
01:36:47,020 --> 01:36:48,080
- Excited?
- Excited?

1818
01:36:48,070 --> 01:36:49,420
I'm really looking forward.

1819
01:36:49,410 --> 01:36:56,440
Sugiyama mama please introduce the clip.

1820
01:36:56,430 --> 01:37:01,690
I think my son did his best.
Please enjoy this clip.

1821
01:37:02,810 --> 01:37:08,250
Ai Sugiyama who reached the world No. 1 in women's doubles.

1822
01:37:06,390 --> 01:37:08,250
No. 1 in the world is impressive.

1823
01:37:08,240 --> 01:37:13,490
She won 3 grand slams in the doubles.

1824
01:37:10,950 --> 01:37:12,620
Amazing.

1825
01:37:13,480 --> 01:37:18,190
Having reached the No. 1 ranking she is called The Super Woman by the tennis world.

1826
01:37:18,180 --> 01:37:25,160
She had 62 consecutive Grand Slam main draw appearances which won her a guiness record.

1827
01:37:25,150 --> 01:37:31,550
In 2009 she retired from her 17 year old tennis career.

1828
01:37:31,740 --> 01:37:34,250
Her husband is a former pro-golfer.

1829
01:37:34,240 --> 01:37:38,300
Even though he is Japanese he was born and raised in Kenya.

1830
01:37:38,290 --> 01:37:41,210
Now he's Ai's manager.

1831
01:37:41,200 --> 01:37:45,990
Here is Yuu who is 3 years and 8 months old and who loves to play with balls.

1832
01:37:45,980 --> 01:37:49,450
Wonder which one of the parents he is taking after?

1833
01:37:50,330 --> 01:37:54,830
Let's first see him play golf with his father.

1834
01:37:57,270 --> 01:37:59,140
Is he a golfer?

1835
01:37:59,530 --> 01:38:00,760
Amazing.

1836
01:38:00,750 --> 01:38:03,590
Or is he a tennis player?

1837
01:38:06,060 --> 01:38:07,110
Well done.

1838
01:38:07,100 --> 01:38:09,690
He has his game face on.

1839
01:38:10,660 --> 01:38:12,530
Okay, next is mommy.

1840
01:38:12,520 --> 01:38:15,080
Ai's tennis club.

1841
01:38:15,070 --> 01:38:22,850
It only felt naturally to have the errand
be centered around this place.

1842
01:38:22,840 --> 01:38:25,330
We want him to always face challenges.

1843
01:38:22,880 --> 01:38:27,260
Sugiyamas 3 rules to bringing up a kid

1844
01:38:25,320 --> 01:38:31,910
It's the first step to accomplish things so that's why we put stress on seriously faces challenges.

1845
01:38:31,900 --> 01:38:38,740
Next is not putting limits to their ability
if I keep telling them that they can't do X thing

1846
01:38:39,730 --> 01:38:48,090
that will really destroy the will of my child so instead I will tell them that I believe in them.

1847
01:38:48,080 --> 01:38:51,090
And the last one is as expected: Waiting.

1848
01:38:51,080 --> 01:38:55,400
Those are some splendid rules but some rules are meant to be broken.

1849
01:38:55,390 --> 01:38:56,630
They aren't.

1850
01:38:56,620 --> 01:39:00,190
Like making him eat without waiting after saying "Hurry up and eat".

1851
01:39:00,180 --> 01:39:02,480
There is a big gap between reality and the ideal.

1852
01:39:02,470 --> 01:39:08,580
And at the club they make him help them out such as picking up balls on the court.

1853
01:39:08,570 --> 01:39:11,030
You are almost done. Once you are done come to us.

1854
01:39:11,530 --> 01:39:14,050
Not putting limits on their ability.

1855
01:39:14,040 --> 01:39:16,360
I will be exhausted if I do it alone.

1856
01:39:16,350 --> 01:39:19,560
You will but you are almost done.

1857
01:39:19,550 --> 01:39:21,120
I wanna do it with mama.

1858
01:39:21,110 --> 01:39:23,050
Okay but only 3 balls.

1859
01:39:23,040 --> 01:39:27,420
Hasn't she just been made to pick up balls by her son?

1860
01:39:26,910 --> 01:39:28,930
What was the meaning of this?

1861
01:39:27,850 --> 01:39:30,430
Yuu easily got away with that.

1862
01:39:30,420 --> 01:39:35,150
The dad has a theory on why it's hard to accomplish the ideal.

1863
01:39:35,140 --> 01:39:39,880
There's a gap between what he is being told and what he wants to do.

1864
01:39:39,870 --> 01:39:46,090
That's right. But it takes time to realize.

1865
01:39:46,080 --> 01:39:50,010
- I am the one who is best put together.
- No way.

1866
01:39:50,000 --> 01:39:54,740
That's what I think.

1867
01:39:56,600 --> 01:40:00,720
They cuddle him while being being afraid of breaking his back.

1868
01:40:00,710 --> 01:40:05,890
The mom has thought of a plan
to make him want to go on an errand.

1869
01:40:05,880 --> 01:40:10,210
If we directly ask him to do it tomorrow he probably won't.

1870
01:40:10,200 --> 01:40:16,650
It's not about having him do warm ups but we need to give him the resolution to accomplish it.

1871
01:40:16,640 --> 01:40:19,700
With resolution is how you greet the world.

1872
01:40:19,760 --> 01:40:21,990
Will it be fine?

1873
01:40:20,650 --> 01:40:23,170
Is dad missing the resolution?

1874
01:40:23,160 --> 01:40:25,170
I'm crying now.

1875
01:40:25,160 --> 01:40:28,200
What kind of tears are those?

1876
01:40:26,250 --> 01:40:28,820
He cries so easily.

1877
01:40:28,200 --> 01:40:30,780
I am so nervous.

1878
01:40:31,860 --> 01:40:36,050
He said he's the best put together of the two. Ai seems to be the one.

1879
01:40:36,420 --> 01:40:40,440
It's finally the day of the errand.

1880
01:40:40,430 --> 01:40:43,890
They have made him help out extra for a month.

1881
01:40:43,880 --> 01:40:46,330
- Good morning.
- Look at this.

1882
01:40:46,320 --> 01:40:48,550
It's still dirty over there.

1883
01:40:48,540 --> 01:40:49,570
I know that.

1884
01:40:49,560 --> 01:40:54,360
One whole month of this kind of exchange.
He must be ready to prove himself helpful.

1885
01:40:54,350 --> 01:40:56,090
This helps a lot.

1886
01:40:56,160 --> 01:40:58,150
He enjoys being praised.

1887
01:40:58,140 --> 01:41:00,250
- He's so determend.
- Nice.

1888
01:41:00,240 --> 01:41:02,290
Okay.

1889
01:41:00,240 --> 01:41:02,290
Okay.

1890
01:41:02,280 --> 01:41:05,480
Thank you. It's become really clean.

1891
01:41:06,180 --> 01:41:10,840
The balls are all over the 4th tennis court if you could...

1892
01:41:10,830 --> 01:41:13,060
Okay, let's go after putting the brooms back.

1893
01:41:13,050 --> 01:41:16,280
Hurrying to the fourth court.

1894
01:41:16,270 --> 01:41:17,960
- Nice.
- Amazing.

1895
01:41:18,880 --> 01:41:21,490
The face of a working man.

1896
01:41:21,480 --> 01:41:26,410
Not pretending to help but actually being helpful.

1897
01:41:27,810 --> 01:41:29,280
Thank you.

1898
01:41:30,440 --> 01:41:32,690
Thank you.

1899
01:41:33,650 --> 01:41:35,900
I did it all.

1900
01:41:35,990 --> 01:41:39,000
Thank you. You helped out everyone.

1901
01:41:38,990 --> 01:41:40,440
Yep.

1902
01:41:40,650 --> 01:41:48,050
He has come to appreciate helping others out.
He's ready since the cherry blossom has bloomed at the club.

1903
01:41:48,040 --> 01:41:56,200
They have a cherry blossom viewing party every year.
And this year they have a special cake to go with it.

1904
01:41:56,600 --> 01:42:00,800
And with this cake the errand begins.

1905
01:42:00,790 --> 01:42:02,270
It's amazing.

1906
01:42:02,260 --> 01:42:03,410
A racket?

1907
01:42:03,400 --> 01:42:05,350
Do you remember it, Yuu?

1908
01:42:05,430 --> 01:42:07,590
The racket is made from chocolate.

1909
01:42:07,580 --> 01:42:12,050
Same racket that mom used to play with.

1910
01:42:07,580 --> 01:42:12,050
That's what it is!

1911
01:42:12,040 --> 01:42:16,390
It's the same type of racket that Ai was using as a player.

1912
01:42:17,040 --> 01:42:22,760
She sent the racket to the cakemaker
and they created a replica.

1913
01:42:22,750 --> 01:42:28,740
And the father left the racket at the cake shop on purpose.

1914
01:42:28,730 --> 01:42:30,460
Where's the racket?

1915
01:42:30,450 --> 01:42:32,010
The racket? Here.

1916
01:42:32,000 --> 01:42:33,940
No no, the real racket.

1917
01:42:33,930 --> 01:42:37,630
The theatrics have begun.

1918
01:42:38,110 --> 01:42:41,670
I mistakenly left it at the cake shop.

1919
01:42:41,760 --> 01:42:44,770
He's saying that he forgot it. This is terrible.

1920
01:42:44,780 --> 01:42:47,550
Without it you can't play tennis.

1921
01:42:47,540 --> 01:42:51,030
- That's right. This is no good.
- We're in trouble.

1922
01:42:51,460 --> 01:42:53,340
I forgot it.

1923
01:42:53,400 --> 01:42:55,800
I'm begging of you. Can you bring it?

1924
01:42:55,790 --> 01:42:58,230
I will? All by myself?

1925
01:42:58,220 --> 01:43:00,060
You can do it.

1926
01:43:00,050 --> 01:43:03,590
Is it okay if it's lost? It's my most precious racket.

1927
01:43:03,580 --> 01:43:06,110
I used it when I was a player.

1928
01:43:06,950 --> 01:43:11,750
That's right.

1929
01:43:06,950 --> 01:43:11,750
Will I go all by myself? But that's a first.

1930
01:43:11,740 --> 01:43:13,140
You can do it.

1931
01:43:13,130 --> 01:43:16,910
How come?

1932
01:43:13,130 --> 01:43:16,910
I don't want to do it.

1933
01:43:16,900 --> 01:43:20,850
I'm sleepy.

1934
01:43:16,900 --> 01:43:20,850
Sleepy? So for the party...

1935
01:43:20,840 --> 01:43:22,510
Being sleepy is an excuse.

1936
01:43:22,500 --> 01:43:25,900
Alright. Let's check if it's cold outside.

1937
01:43:25,890 --> 01:43:28,520
His father is taking him outside.

1938
01:43:28,510 --> 01:43:32,710
It's fine. Come. Tell me if it's cold or not.

1939
01:43:32,700 --> 01:43:37,410
As your mom said you will become energetic from walking.

1940
01:43:37,400 --> 01:43:41,430
The dad's reasoning removed the excuse about being sleepy.

1941
01:43:41,420 --> 01:43:44,040
Look at this racket once more.

1942
01:43:44,220 --> 01:43:46,490
This means a lot to your mommy.

1943
01:43:46,480 --> 01:43:50,150
- Remember it, Yuu.
- I'm begging you.

1944
01:43:51,250 --> 01:43:51,950
What?

1945
01:43:51,940 --> 01:43:54,360
I want to go with mom.

1946
01:43:54,350 --> 01:44:00,150
"I want to go with mom". That's not an excuse.
He still struggles to find the willpower.

1947
01:44:00,140 --> 01:44:02,290
Let's send you off.

1948
01:44:03,360 --> 01:44:04,790
Can you go?

1949
01:44:04,780 --> 01:44:06,790
I can't go.

1950
01:44:06,780 --> 01:44:08,330
Really?

1951
01:44:08,750 --> 01:44:11,910
They must seize this moment.

1952
01:44:11,900 --> 01:44:15,340
Exactly. Find that energy.

1953
01:44:15,400 --> 01:44:17,300
He has lots of power.

1954
01:44:17,290 --> 01:44:20,070
I want to keep crying.

1955
01:44:20,060 --> 01:44:22,210
Harvesting the energy from crying.

1956
01:44:22,200 --> 01:44:25,850
Alright. Try to cry with all your might.

1957
01:44:26,030 --> 01:44:32,890
Here is a mother who is experienced with tears having to appear before finding the willpower.

1958
01:44:32,880 --> 01:44:36,170
The mother is just smiling through it.

1959
01:44:34,560 --> 01:44:41,760
If you have to cry then cry but
turn that energy into something

1960
01:44:41,750 --> 01:44:45,300
and do something with it. That is crucial.

1961
01:44:45,490 --> 01:44:50,220
Of course, Ai knows all about finding the willpower.

1962
01:44:51,270 --> 01:44:53,360
Tell me what you dislike about it.

1963
01:44:53,350 --> 01:44:55,490
I will become a missing child.

1964
01:44:55,480 --> 01:45:00,590
You will definitely not. Follow the road straight ahead. You don't have to turn even once.

1965
01:45:00,580 --> 01:45:01,810
Just has to go straight.

1966
01:45:01,800 --> 01:45:03,350
It's simple.

1967
01:45:03,920 --> 01:45:08,530
When someone yawns then it means that they are sleepy.

1968
01:45:08,520 --> 01:45:11,740
That's just an excuse.

1969
01:45:11,730 --> 01:45:14,380
I get it. When you are nervous you yawn.

1970
01:45:14,380 --> 01:45:16,290
She thwarted yet another excuse.

1971
01:45:16,280 --> 01:45:19,450
What if I become lonely.

1972
01:45:19,440 --> 01:45:21,070
This is reality.

1973
01:45:21,060 --> 01:45:25,300
I get it. I have prepared something
so you won't get lonely.

1974
01:45:25,290 --> 01:45:29,370
They've even thought of a way to avoid him from getting lonely.

1975
01:45:29,370 --> 01:45:33,380
A teddy bear. His name is Daiji (precious).

1976
01:45:33,370 --> 01:45:40,930
As a baby he would wrap it in a towel
and never ever let it out of his sight.

1977
01:45:40,920 --> 01:45:44,550
Mommy will be in trouble without the racket.

1978
01:45:44,540 --> 01:45:47,410
He tries to avoid going by taking Daiji out.

1979
01:45:47,400 --> 01:45:50,200
Then it can't be helped.
Let's cancel the party.

1980
01:45:50,190 --> 01:45:53,140
His mothers final measure.

1981
01:45:53,250 --> 01:45:56,500
It's fine. If you can't do it then fine.

1982
01:45:56,490 --> 01:46:00,850
Meanwhile, his father is in the parking lot.

1983
01:46:00,840 --> 01:46:03,400
- He's not witnessing any of this.
- That's right.

1984
01:46:03,390 --> 01:46:06,800
Will he go? I want him to but...

1985
01:46:06,790 --> 01:46:09,970
His father also can't find the resolution.

1986
01:46:08,520 --> 01:46:11,970
He's close to letting him give up.

1987
01:46:09,960 --> 01:46:14,410
I will refuse in front of everyone.
I will tell them that Yuu can't do it.

1988
01:46:14,400 --> 01:46:17,100
His mother is resolute that he has to go.

1989
01:46:17,320 --> 01:46:18,930
No way.

1990
01:46:18,920 --> 01:46:19,830
No way, right?

1991
01:46:19,820 --> 01:46:25,270
And at that moment Yuu's crying changes.

1992
01:46:25,490 --> 01:46:27,030
I will go get it.

1993
01:46:27,020 --> 01:46:29,230
Will you? Thank you.

1994
01:46:29,220 --> 01:46:31,990
Will we meet again when I come back?

1995
01:46:31,980 --> 01:46:35,380
Of course. That's a given.

1996
01:46:35,810 --> 01:46:39,530
Hug me for 5 minutes and then I will go.

1997
01:46:39,520 --> 01:46:40,800
Okay.

1998
01:46:41,150 --> 01:46:45,690
Something took hold in Yuu's heart.

1999
01:46:45,680 --> 01:46:56,180
I will hug you for 5 minutes so you can gather your strength and decide to go.

2000
01:46:56,170 --> 01:47:00,090
Yuu, you are mammas child so you can definitely do it.

2001
01:47:00,520 --> 01:47:03,170
Tell me when you feel strong enough to go.

2002
01:47:03,160 --> 01:47:05,220
And then wait. (Rule 3)

2003
01:47:05,210 --> 01:47:08,130
Tell me when you are ready.

2004
01:47:09,400 --> 01:47:10,550
Can you go?

2005
01:47:11,810 --> 01:47:13,400
He found the willpower.

2006
01:47:13,390 --> 01:47:15,560
I will go.

2007
01:47:15,350 --> 01:47:16,660
Remarkable.

2008
01:47:16,650 --> 01:47:22,420
Alright. Let's do our best.
If it's you, Yuu, then you can do it.

2009
01:47:22,410 --> 01:47:25,250
Take mama's...

2010
01:47:24,520 --> 01:47:29,040
Can do it.

2011
01:47:25,240 --> 01:47:29,590
The good luck charm contains his mothers wish.

2012
01:47:29,580 --> 01:47:32,740
This is a special backpack.

2013
01:47:32,730 --> 01:47:34,150
This is for rackets.

2014
01:47:34,140 --> 01:47:35,920
Rackets can fit in it.

2015
01:47:35,910 --> 01:47:39,140
Papa attached this special band to it.

2016
01:47:39,130 --> 01:47:48,040
The father thought of this and created it.
There's a hole at the bottom that the grip can go through.

2017
01:47:48,030 --> 01:47:51,350
Will he be able to explain this to the cake maker?

2018
01:47:51,340 --> 01:47:59,490
Alright. Ready to go.
Please do it. Thank you.

2019
01:47:59,480 --> 01:48:02,370
Can you go from here or should I follow you to the road?

2020
01:48:04,150 --> 01:48:07,020
If it's Yuu, then I can do it.

2021
01:48:05,820 --> 01:48:07,830
Amazing.

2022
01:48:07,070 --> 01:48:08,870
Off you go then.

2023
01:48:08,270 --> 01:48:09,830
He suddenly changed.

2024
01:48:09,180 --> 01:48:15,360
He's gathered all this energy from crying
it's almost like he's a different person.

2025
01:48:15,350 --> 01:48:17,300
Alright, I can do it.

2026
01:48:16,760 --> 01:48:18,840
You can do it.

2027
01:48:18,240 --> 01:48:21,540
It's straight forward and downhill.

2028
01:48:21,530 --> 01:48:24,560
He needs to pick up the racket from the cake shop.

2029
01:48:24,550 --> 01:48:37,330
At the convenience store he was asked to get 2 packs of three-color rice balls as well as a cherry blossom steamed bun.

2030
01:48:38,220 --> 01:48:41,990
Yuu likes to be seen by people and held in esteem.

2031
01:48:41,980 --> 01:48:48,630
But today he is all alone which is hard for him.

2032
01:48:48,620 --> 01:48:56,120
At this moment someone who is always watching Yuu, believes that he can accomplish this.

2033
01:48:56,490 --> 01:48:57,960
- Amazing.
- What is?

2034
01:48:57,950 --> 01:49:00,600
I could never do this errand.

2035
01:49:00,590 --> 01:49:03,320
- Of course you could.
- I see but...

2036
01:49:03,310 --> 01:49:08,830
- Whose kid do you think it is? It's my kid.
- Hey, make some room for me.

2037
01:49:08,820 --> 01:49:13,970
Did he feel their confidence in him?
Yuu started running.

2038
01:49:13,960 --> 01:49:17,750
Right, heading towards the cake shop.

2039
01:49:17,740 --> 01:49:25,880
Erm wait!? There's a convenience store on the way there? Actually there are 3 right around here.

2040
01:49:25,870 --> 01:49:33,360
The blossom viewing party basket is in the 100 yen convenience store not here.

2041
01:49:33,350 --> 01:49:41,700
The things he was asked to get
I bet they aren't here.

2042
01:49:45,000 --> 01:49:47,250
A pink steamed bun as requested?

2043
01:49:47,240 --> 01:49:49,780
Found it.

2044
01:49:47,240 --> 01:49:49,780
Found it?

2045
01:49:49,770 --> 01:49:54,280
It's a thank you "Heisei era for being over" bun.

2046
01:49:52,700 --> 01:49:54,280
Not it.

2047
01:49:54,270 --> 01:49:57,840
No three-colored rice balls
but he picked up mitarashi rice balls.

2048
01:50:00,400 --> 01:50:01,960
Please and thanks.

2049
01:50:01,950 --> 01:50:05,090
Unfortunately both of them are off.

2050
01:50:04,110 --> 01:50:06,800
They are close enough.

2051
01:50:07,320 --> 01:50:09,820
Today it's a cherry blossom viewing party.

2052
01:50:09,810 --> 01:50:12,230
His first conversation on the errand.

2053
01:50:12,220 --> 01:50:15,990
Because of the party I had to come alone today.

2054
01:50:13,560 --> 01:50:15,990
Amazing, he can converse.

2055
01:50:15,980 --> 01:50:17,320
That's the spirit.

2056
01:50:17,310 --> 01:50:21,330
It's my first time coming out like this alone.

2057
01:50:21,770 --> 01:50:23,250
Properly paying.

2058
01:50:23,240 --> 01:50:25,000
From 1000 yen.

2059
01:50:29,370 --> 01:50:32,230
And getting the money back.

2060
01:50:34,380 --> 01:50:38,390
He was living in Chigasaki prefecture and he's coming home today

2061
01:50:38,380 --> 01:50:39,200
He is?

2062
01:50:39,190 --> 01:50:40,170
back to Japan.

2063
01:50:40,160 --> 01:50:42,130
That's the usual Yuu.

2064
01:50:42,120 --> 01:50:45,010
Chigasaki is in Japan, though.

2065
01:50:45,000 --> 01:50:49,810
Since I will become a young boy...

2066
01:50:49,800 --> 01:50:56,210
Yesterday was a kindergarten entrance ceremony​
and he's proud to be considered a young boy.

2067
01:50:58,820 --> 01:51:00,740
Can't forget this.

2068
01:51:00,730 --> 01:51:03,690
No good. He forgot just like his dad.

2069
01:51:03,950 --> 01:51:05,240
Thank you.

2070
01:51:06,640 --> 01:51:10,310
He bought the wrong things but he feels accomplished now.

2071
01:51:10,300 --> 01:51:13,880
He can do things even if people aren't watching.

2072
01:51:13,870 --> 01:51:16,960
Nah, they were watching.

2073
01:51:18,180 --> 01:51:19,850
Switch it up.

2074
01:51:21,240 --> 01:51:23,490
What are they doing?

2075
01:51:23,450 --> 01:51:26,360
Alright, let's split it.

2076
01:51:23,450 --> 01:51:26,360
They are sharing it!

2077
01:51:27,420 --> 01:51:29,370
What's up with this comedy duo.

2078
01:51:28,840 --> 01:51:30,690
From their expensive apartment.

2079
01:51:30,680 --> 01:51:32,040
I can see. Can you?

2080
01:51:32,030 --> 01:51:34,640
They are watching over him.

2081
01:51:32,730 --> 01:51:34,640
Such a good relation.

2082
01:51:34,860 --> 01:51:36,760
That was funny.

2083
01:51:39,390 --> 01:51:39,940
Peew.

2084
01:51:39,970 --> 01:51:42,420
He dropped something.

2085
01:51:42,040 --> 01:51:44,420
Oh no, Daiji.

2086
01:51:45,200 --> 01:51:48,690
It's Daiji (precious) the teddy bear.

2087
01:51:49,090 --> 01:51:55,750
He dropped Daiji and ran off and as an exception the staff called out to him about Daiji.

2088
01:51:51,180 --> 01:51:53,860
He didn't notice.

2089
01:51:56,950 --> 01:52:03,290
It's dangerous running so close to the road and you seem to have dropped something.

2090
01:52:03,280 --> 01:52:04,130
Huh?

2091
01:52:04,120 --> 01:52:06,310
Is that brown thing not yours?

2092
01:52:08,500 --> 01:52:10,110
Daiji isn't there.

2093
01:52:10,330 --> 01:52:12,010
It fell off from there.

2094
01:52:12,420 --> 01:52:17,490
Daiji was with him when he learned to walk and of course they always slept together.

2095
01:52:17,480 --> 01:52:22,910
And when he rides a car or when they went to France he can go anywhere as long as Daiji is with him.

2096
01:52:22,900 --> 01:52:27,330
This 6th generation Daiji who is a bit dirty.

2097
01:52:25,130 --> 01:52:28,050
- 6th generation.
- That much?

2098
01:52:29,020 --> 01:52:31,450
Never leave my side.

2099
01:52:30,790 --> 01:52:31,970
Alright.

2100
01:52:51,360 --> 01:52:56,200
He's exhausted from going down the hill. For those times...

2101
01:52:56,190 --> 01:52:58,740
Energy injection.

2102
01:52:58,730 --> 01:53:01,310
It's candy for revitalizing him.

2103
01:53:00,480 --> 01:53:01,310
Candy.

2104
01:53:01,300 --> 01:53:07,500
"Please eat it when you feel exhausted" his mother said and put it in his pocket.

2105
01:53:07,320 --> 01:53:09,100
He's walking again.

2106
01:53:09,090 --> 01:53:12,900
Yuu who came to a sudden stop started walking again.

2107
01:53:12,890 --> 01:53:14,900
Here I go.

2108
01:53:17,060 --> 01:53:19,010
It's the cake shop.

2109
01:53:19,000 --> 01:53:25,720
As part of the Swiss owned hotel
here they make their own original cakes.

2110
01:53:23,990 --> 01:53:25,720
Looks so yummy.

2111
01:53:25,710 --> 01:53:29,890
He came to pick up the racket his father forgot there.

2112
01:53:31,790 --> 01:53:33,490
Hello.

2113
01:53:33,480 --> 01:53:35,380
The owner and chef.

2114
01:53:35,370 --> 01:53:37,380
Please give me a racket.

2115
01:53:37,370 --> 01:53:38,840
A racket?

2116
01:53:39,040 --> 01:53:42,010
Mama used to play tennis.

2117
01:53:42,000 --> 01:53:45,820
Mama's racket? I will go look for it.

2118
01:53:45,970 --> 01:53:48,170
Must be inside the kitchen.

2119
01:53:48,160 --> 01:53:50,770
He was able to explain it.

2120
01:53:50,760 --> 01:53:55,140
The chef understood it too
that this is an important racket

2121
01:53:55,130 --> 01:53:56,870
Is this the one?

2122
01:53:56,860 --> 01:54:00,300
He's making sure that this is mamas racket.

2123
01:54:00,290 --> 01:54:04,660
Not like many people forget rackets in this place.

2124
01:54:04,650 --> 01:54:06,710
Please put it in this red bag for me.

2125
01:54:06,700 --> 01:54:10,600
Explaining this will be difficult.

2126
01:54:08,830 --> 01:54:10,320
This one.

2127
01:54:10,590 --> 01:54:12,750
This one? Will it fit?

2128
01:54:12,740 --> 01:54:13,890
It will.

2129
01:54:13,880 --> 01:54:15,380
It's bigger than the bag.

2130
01:54:15,370 --> 01:54:21,390
Not this end. From here.
There's a hole down here.

2131
01:54:17,790 --> 01:54:19,770
That's right.

2132
01:54:21,380 --> 01:54:23,240
Ah, there is a hole.

2133
01:54:21,840 --> 01:54:23,220
Amazing.

2134
01:54:23,230 --> 01:54:25,740
And put it through here.

2135
01:54:25,730 --> 01:54:29,520
He was able to explain it.

2136
01:54:27,940 --> 01:54:29,520
Amazing.

2137
01:54:29,510 --> 01:54:35,700
And then put it through here.

2138
01:54:35,690 --> 01:54:38,090
I am?

2139
01:54:35,690 --> 01:54:38,090
You're sweating.

2140
01:54:38,080 --> 01:54:41,780
Chef, we appreciate your help.

2141
01:54:40,600 --> 01:54:41,780
It's your fault.

2142
01:54:41,770 --> 01:54:43,590
Cause he's using all his effort.

2143
01:54:43,580 --> 01:54:47,880
The chef is using all his skill.

2144
01:54:45,760 --> 01:54:49,690
- Chef!
- Chef, thank you very much.

2145
01:54:50,290 --> 01:54:51,520
That's perfect.

2146
01:54:51,510 --> 01:54:52,780
That's right.

2147
01:54:52,770 --> 01:54:55,240
Wanna try it out?

2148
01:54:55,230 --> 01:54:56,790
Fits perfectly.

2149
01:54:56,780 --> 01:54:59,140
It is?

2150
01:54:56,780 --> 01:54:59,140
This is fine.

2151
01:54:59,130 --> 01:55:01,790
Alright, take it back to your mother.

2152
01:55:01,780 --> 01:55:08,670
Mothers important racket and the groceries.

2153
01:55:08,660 --> 01:55:10,030
Thank you.

2154
01:55:10,540 --> 01:55:12,810
Thank you very much, chef.

2155
01:55:14,760 --> 01:55:21,070
The 100 yen convinience store where the requested items are on the other side of the road.

2156
01:55:21,050 --> 01:55:24,820
It's very close to where he's walking right now.

2157
01:55:24,810 --> 01:55:27,440
I wonder if he got the racket.

2158
01:55:27,430 --> 01:55:30,770
They can't see well from this angle.

2159
01:55:30,760 --> 01:55:32,970
Can't see at all.

2160
01:55:34,110 --> 01:55:40,110
Even if no one is watching over him
Yuu is doing just fine, mother.

2161
01:55:41,540 --> 01:55:45,240
- He finally went out.
- He did.

2162
01:55:45,230 --> 01:55:50,200
- How has it been so far?
- It really took a while to get him to leave.

2163
01:55:50,190 --> 01:55:58,040
I was worried if he would be fine but gradually his behavior changed so I started having confidence in him.

2164
01:55:58,030 --> 01:55:59,620
It changed the moment he left.

2165
01:55:59,610 --> 01:56:02,460
Even I was surprised by that change.

2166
01:56:02,630 --> 01:56:08,160
Now I understand the strength of your son
but I also understood the weakness of your husband.

2167
01:56:08,150 --> 01:56:09,830
Yeah, the husband.

2168
01:56:09,820 --> 01:56:13,090
He was so anxious the day before.

2169
01:56:13,080 --> 01:56:16,940
Even he didn't understood why he was crying.

2170
01:56:16,930 --> 01:56:19,060
Even said that he couldn't do the errand.

2171
01:56:19,050 --> 01:56:24,650
About this teary-eyed father
he is in fact in the studio today

2172
01:56:24,640 --> 01:56:27,090
Yuu's papa, where are you?

2173
01:56:27,240 --> 01:56:29,010
Thank you very much.

2174
01:56:31,520 --> 01:56:37,320
Since you came all the way,
why don't you come and sit here with us?

2175
01:56:37,310 --> 01:56:39,380
Isn't that right, everybody?

2176
01:56:39,370 --> 01:56:40,580
Come and watch.

2177
01:56:40,570 --> 01:56:43,180
From "my first errand" to "my first trial".

2178
01:56:43,170 --> 01:56:45,080
The father is on trial now.

2179
01:56:45,070 --> 01:56:47,380
He's already crying.

2180
01:56:47,480 --> 01:56:50,660
Just finished wailing.

2181
01:56:50,660 --> 01:56:53,110
Papa, please share how you feel.

2182
01:56:53,100 --> 01:56:55,430
I can't find the words.

2183
01:56:55,420 --> 01:56:57,910
- Mama is so strong.
- She is.

2184
01:56:57,900 --> 01:57:05,440
Just like she said. If I was alone in this I would immediately give in and go with him to pick it up.

2185
01:57:05,430 --> 01:57:13,430
It was mostly cut out but I was in that car for long mumbling "isn't it enough already".

2186
01:57:13,420 --> 01:57:17,880
I kept thinking about giving up but
Ai said that this kid can definitely do it.

2187
01:57:17,870 --> 01:57:23,640
Her confidence in our son was so strong that it started rubbing off on me too.

2188
01:57:23,630 --> 01:57:26,990
- It's the strength of a mother.
- What a cool mom.

2189
01:57:27,650 --> 01:57:30,520
It's time to go shopping again.

2190
01:57:30,510 --> 01:57:37,990
He needs to get 2 packs of three-color rice balls as well as a cherry blossom steamed bun. Then back to the tennis club.

2191
01:57:37,980 --> 01:57:41,610
Since he doesn't have to hold the racket he can raise his hand.

2192
01:57:41,600 --> 01:57:44,930
The father really thought of everything.

2193
01:57:45,390 --> 01:57:47,520
Isn't the camera too close?

2194
01:57:47,510 --> 01:57:51,300
No, it's fine.

2195
01:57:47,840 --> 01:57:50,510
Camera

2196
01:57:56,030 --> 01:57:58,030
Oh no.

2197
01:57:58,640 --> 01:58:02,220
For those times...

2198
01:58:00,040 --> 01:58:01,600
Suspicious.

2199
01:58:01,590 --> 01:58:03,920
Too suspicious.

2200
01:58:03,910 --> 01:58:09,620
Weird. No one behaves like that.

2201
01:58:09,610 --> 01:58:16,710
"Why is he playing tennis here?"
he wonders but he didn't notice the camera.

2202
01:58:14,890 --> 01:58:16,710
Amazing.

2203
01:58:16,700 --> 01:58:18,230
At this moment.

2204
01:58:18,220 --> 01:58:20,430
Yuu, take care.

2205
01:58:20,420 --> 01:58:24,080
The chef was watching over him.

2206
01:58:24,070 --> 01:58:25,360
Bye bye.

2207
01:58:25,350 --> 01:58:30,380
As expected, he does best when people watch over him.

2208
01:58:35,520 --> 01:58:37,970
He has arrived at the 100 yen store.

2209
01:58:37,960 --> 01:58:44,630
The cherry blossom viewing party basket is right near the entrence.

2210
01:58:44,350 --> 01:58:46,550
Found it.

2211
01:58:46,740 --> 01:58:53,180
He found the rice balls and was asked to get two.

2212
01:58:53,170 --> 01:58:56,820
- Remarkable.
- He knows to get two.

2213
01:58:57,900 --> 01:59:02,700
That's right. Here's another one for Yuu to talk to.

2214
01:59:03,120 --> 01:59:05,240
296 yen, please.

2215
01:59:05,670 --> 01:59:12,120
We are having a party. Mama, Yuu and papa will eat this.

2216
01:59:13,970 --> 01:59:16,100
Is this an important racket?

2217
01:59:16,090 --> 01:59:19,650
This is the racket that accomplished the first place.

2218
01:59:18,510 --> 01:59:20,550
Amazing, isn't it?

2219
01:59:19,640 --> 01:59:23,740
My mom used to be a tennis player

2220
01:59:23,730 --> 01:59:26,410
back then she used this racket.

2221
01:59:26,400 --> 01:59:31,160
Of all people, this is Sugiyama Ai's racket.

2222
01:59:31,150 --> 01:59:34,410
What kind of player was your mother?
Was she a great player?

2223
01:59:34,400 --> 01:59:37,030
Yes, she lost to everyone.

2224
01:59:34,400 --> 01:59:45,940
TN: He mistakes the preposition.
Tiny mistake but results in the opposite meaning.

2225
01:59:38,680 --> 01:59:41,240
- He's pretty wrong.
- It's the other way around.

2226
01:59:41,420 --> 01:59:43,410
She would lose to everyone.

2227
01:59:43,400 --> 01:59:45,940
She didn't lose to anyone.

2228
01:59:46,350 --> 01:59:48,790
Don't forget like your father.

2229
01:59:48,800 --> 01:59:51,110
Don't forget this.

2230
01:59:52,650 --> 01:59:54,690
Looks heavy.

2231
01:59:52,650 --> 01:59:54,690
Thank you.

2232
01:59:54,680 --> 02:00:00,360
Ah, he's there. Isn't that Yuu?
It is. Have a look.

2233
02:00:00,350 --> 02:00:03,070
And he's carrying something.

2234
02:00:05,600 --> 02:00:08,240
- I can't see.
- I want to see. I beg of you.

2235
02:00:08,120 --> 02:00:09,860
He's begging.

2236
02:00:09,020 --> 02:00:12,980
- Alright, have a look.
- Are you sure?

2237
02:00:13,170 --> 02:00:16,050
What they can't see is his expression.

2238
02:00:16,040 --> 02:00:19,480
And of course they can't see what he bought either.

2239
02:00:19,470 --> 02:00:23,670
He accomplished everything he was asked to do.

2240
02:00:23,660 --> 02:00:26,060
He's entering the convenience store again.

2241
02:00:26,050 --> 02:00:28,970
He already has all he needs.

2242
02:00:28,960 --> 02:00:31,950
What is he going to purchase?

2243
02:00:32,830 --> 02:00:40,040
He picked up the racket and purchased all that's needed so why did he go into a third convenience store?

2244
02:00:40,030 --> 02:00:42,210
What is he getting?

2245
02:00:42,200 --> 02:00:44,350
He really loves stores.

2246
02:00:43,730 --> 02:00:45,330
That's enough.

2247
02:00:48,590 --> 02:00:50,490
You can't carry all that, Yuu.

2248
02:00:51,120 --> 02:00:54,850
They could see he was carrying a lot.

2249
02:00:57,590 --> 02:01:00,810
There are no needed items.

2250
02:01:02,010 --> 02:01:04,240
Just come home.

2251
02:01:05,820 --> 02:01:09,090
There's nothing more to get.

2252
02:01:09,080 --> 02:01:11,140
What will he purchase?

2253
02:01:11,130 --> 02:01:13,990
Where is Pamu?

2254
02:01:13,980 --> 02:01:16,920
Pamu is the name of the tennis club.

2255
02:01:16,910 --> 02:01:20,180
Go back to Pamu?

2256
02:01:16,910 --> 02:01:20,180
I just want to go back to Pamu.

2257
02:01:21,160 --> 02:01:27,110
I want to go back there since I was running an errand and now I want to return.

2258
02:01:27,100 --> 02:01:31,850
Pamu isn't the name of a house so what is it?

2259
02:01:31,840 --> 02:01:35,080
In a court you go like this.

2260
02:01:35,610 --> 02:01:37,940
A tennis court?

2261
02:01:35,610 --> 02:01:37,940
That's right.

2262
02:01:37,930 --> 02:01:42,930
You would have to go up the hill.
Can you go up there?

2263
02:01:42,920 --> 02:01:44,590
I can do it.

2264
02:01:42,920 --> 02:01:44,590
You can?

2265
02:01:46,420 --> 02:01:49,360
Thank you.

2266
02:01:46,420 --> 02:01:49,360
Then please do your best.

2267
02:01:48,530 --> 02:01:49,360
Splendid.

2268
02:01:49,350 --> 02:01:54,140
He knew the way, of course.
He just wanted to talk.

2269
02:01:53,480 --> 02:01:55,210
I see.

2270
02:01:55,200 --> 02:01:58,110
Alright. I will go.

2271
02:02:20,170 --> 02:02:24,030
His resolute expression is different from his crying face.

2272
02:02:24,020 --> 02:02:28,220
But this power was born from his crying.

2273
02:02:28,730 --> 02:02:32,380
Mama must be waiting.

2274
02:02:34,330 --> 02:02:39,530
Mama's world No. 1 has been entrusted to Yuu.

2275
02:02:39,520 --> 02:02:41,650
This is so heavy.

2276
02:02:46,200 --> 02:02:49,750
Yuu is back at the tennis club.

2277
02:02:52,830 --> 02:02:53,870
Yuu!

2278
02:02:53,860 --> 02:02:57,170
How amazing.

2279
02:02:53,860 --> 02:02:57,170
I purchased this.

2280
02:02:57,160 --> 02:03:03,850
What did you buy? And my racket?
Thank you, it's my important racket.

2281
02:03:03,840 --> 02:03:08,050
- It's perfect.
- Amazing. Thank you.

2282
02:03:08,050 --> 02:03:10,550
You did a great job.

2283
02:03:10,780 --> 02:03:14,630
Did you manage to ask for it?

2284
02:03:14,620 --> 02:03:17,890
- At the cake shop?
- Did you ask the cake maker?

2285
02:03:17,880 --> 02:03:23,480
From happiness since you did so well. I think you are amazing.

2286
02:03:17,880 --> 02:03:23,480
Why are there tears coming out?

2287
02:03:24,410 --> 02:03:26,050
Where's the cake?

2288
02:03:26,690 --> 02:03:32,010
- First show us what you bought.
- Tell us, tell us.

2289
02:03:32,010 --> 02:03:34,140
The chef gave me...

2290
02:03:34,130 --> 02:03:38,370
Ah, mama loves those.

2291
02:03:34,130 --> 02:03:38,370
These things.

2292
02:03:38,360 --> 02:03:45,180
That's right mama. I thought mama loves these so...

2293
02:03:45,170 --> 02:03:48,410
That's right. I love mitarashi rice balls.

2294
02:03:48,400 --> 02:03:49,520
Amazing.

2295
02:03:49,510 --> 02:03:53,940
It was fun on my first errand.

2296
02:03:53,930 --> 02:03:58,090
He was happy to do it in the end.

2297
02:03:58,080 --> 02:04:00,700
Please eat this.

2298
02:04:00,840 --> 02:04:04,850
Time for the cherry blossom viewing party.

2299
02:04:03,830 --> 02:04:04,820
Wonderful.

2300
02:04:04,840 --> 02:04:09,920
Yuu did his best for the party. Thank you.

2301
02:04:10,540 --> 02:04:12,010
Did his best.

2302
02:04:13,740 --> 02:04:15,900
Nice smile.

2303
02:04:15,090 --> 02:04:16,260
Thank you, Yuu.

2304
02:04:16,250 --> 02:04:21,800
He was asked to get them but these are mama's beloved mitarashi rice balls.

2305
02:04:21,960 --> 02:04:23,740
Not that good.

2306
02:04:23,580 --> 02:04:25,400
Not that good?

2307
02:04:24,750 --> 02:04:26,170
Super tasty.

2308
02:04:27,360 --> 02:04:31,570
Everyone, be careful that it doesn't get caught in your throats

2309
02:04:31,560 --> 02:04:34,440
so please eat it slowly

2310
02:04:34,150 --> 02:04:36,020
He's worried about them.

2311
02:04:36,360 --> 02:04:39,890
Hey Yuu, what do you want to be when you grow up?

2312
02:04:40,470 --> 02:04:41,970
Cuisine.

2313
02:04:42,580 --> 02:04:43,690
Chef?

2314
02:04:44,670 --> 02:04:47,560
Neither golf nor tennis

2315
02:04:47,550 --> 02:04:52,020
but Yuu might become the worlds best chef.

2316
02:04:57,300 --> 02:04:59,160
- Splendid.
- It was splendid.

2317
02:04:59,150 --> 02:05:01,250
Got them because mama loves them.

2318
02:05:01,240 --> 02:05:03,210
That tugged at my heartstrings.

2319
02:05:03,200 --> 02:05:11,190
Yeah, at first I thought that we should get rice balls matching the color of cherry blossom

2320
02:05:11,180 --> 02:05:18,640
but normally I go for mitarashi rice balls and usually go for them so he must've been observing me.

2321
02:05:18,630 --> 02:05:21,250
- I totally thought he had made a mistake.
- That's right.

2322
02:05:21,240 --> 02:05:24,400
but it was to show gratitude towards his mother.

2323
02:05:24,390 --> 02:05:27,220
Father, are you okay after watching this?

2324
02:05:24,580 --> 02:05:27,080
Too much crying.

2325
02:05:27,210 --> 02:05:31,210
Well... I'm lost for words.

2326
02:05:31,200 --> 02:05:33,110
- Are you okay?
- Definitely not.

2327
02:05:33,100 --> 02:05:35,520
You were crying throughout.

2328
02:05:35,510 --> 02:05:41,330
And one staff member had a camera in his racket. What was all that about?

2329
02:05:41,320 --> 02:05:44,870
Who holds a racket like this?

2330
02:05:44,860 --> 02:05:54,140
What a cute kid. And just like how we watched a mother raising their boy this time we have a 4 year old girl.

2331
02:05:54,850 --> 02:06:02,370
Inami in Toyama prefecture is a
flourishing town built around a shrine.

2332
02:06:02,360 --> 02:06:11,370
Wood crafting is famous there and many sculptures around.

2333
02:06:08,480 --> 02:06:10,900
Amazing.

2334
02:06:11,360 --> 02:06:15,040
And there we find a bustling road leading up to the shrine.

2335
02:06:15,030 --> 02:06:18,850
At this kimono fabrics store we find a 4 year old girl.

2336
02:06:19,000 --> 02:06:22,040
Here is Sae who helps out her mother.

2337
02:06:20,780 --> 02:06:22,040
Admirable.

2338
02:06:22,030 --> 02:06:24,630
She does everything in earnestness.

2339
02:06:24,620 --> 02:06:30,030
She loves working at the shop and
she also helps out her grandmother.

2340
02:06:30,020 --> 02:06:38,040
Readying the spare change. Grandma brings them every day this to a supermarket close by.

2341
02:06:38,030 --> 02:06:40,610
Putting the change in a bag.

2342
02:06:40,970 --> 02:06:44,630
Off you go.

2343
02:06:40,970 --> 02:06:44,630
Taking off.

2344
02:06:44,620 --> 02:06:47,860
Mother.

2345
02:06:44,900 --> 02:06:48,910
Make sure to work hard and come back.

2346
02:06:49,410 --> 02:06:52,950
Grandma has been out for 20 minutes.

2347
02:06:52,940 --> 02:06:54,130
Yes, yes.

2348
02:06:54,120 --> 02:06:55,000
A call from her.

2349
02:06:54,990 --> 02:06:58,990
Ah Sae, she's saying that she forgot the money.

2350
02:06:58,980 --> 02:07:01,330
The 50 yen coin bag.

2351
02:07:01,320 --> 02:07:02,200
What?

2352
02:07:02,190 --> 02:07:04,570
The grandmas strategy.

2353
02:07:04,560 --> 02:07:06,920
What? Okay.

2354
02:07:06,970 --> 02:07:08,820
Found it!

2355
02:07:08,810 --> 02:07:10,530
They hid it.

2356
02:07:09,780 --> 02:07:10,970
I found it.

2357
02:07:10,960 --> 02:07:13,000
Sae is full of energy.

2358
02:07:12,990 --> 02:07:14,490
What should we do, Sae?

2359
02:07:14,480 --> 02:07:17,460
Does this mean that she will go on an errand?

2360
02:07:17,670 --> 02:07:19,780
Was it underneath it??

2361
02:07:19,780 --> 02:07:24,290
Sae, can you bring this? To Asamo.

2362
02:07:24,280 --> 02:07:25,700
Got it.

2363
02:07:24,280 --> 02:07:25,700
You did?

2364
02:07:25,690 --> 02:07:27,530
Alright.

2365
02:07:27,520 --> 02:07:33,370
The flowers for Buddha have withered. Can you also get some fresh ones?

2366
02:07:33,360 --> 02:07:34,450
Yes.

2367
02:07:34,440 --> 02:07:40,850
The town next door is after the big crossing
grandma's shop is in the supermarket

2368
02:07:40,840 --> 02:07:44,630
she can buy the flowers in the same building.

2369
02:07:44,620 --> 02:07:49,340
Off I go.

2370
02:07:44,620 --> 02:07:49,340
Take care. Take your time.

2371
02:07:49,330 --> 02:07:53,650
Sae, has been begging to go on
an errand so it can't be helped.

2372
02:07:53,640 --> 02:07:56,520
It's my first time.

2373
02:07:53,640 --> 02:07:56,520
TN: Ending a sentence in dawa is very lady like and cute.

2374
02:07:56,510 --> 02:07:58,190
So fun.

2375
02:07:57,450 --> 02:07:59,080
So fun.

2376
02:07:58,180 --> 02:08:04,440
This is her first errand and it's spring.

2377
02:08:09,220 --> 02:08:15,950
She has arrived at the crossing and this sculpture has been made in Inami.

2378
02:08:15,940 --> 02:08:19,070
Welcome to Inami.

2379
02:08:19,060 --> 02:08:21,480
It can talk.

2380
02:08:21,470 --> 02:08:24,540
From here on the scenery immediately changes.

2381
02:08:24,530 --> 02:08:30,550
A wide crossing with no obstructed view
and since few cars pass there are no traffic lights.

2382
02:08:30,540 --> 02:08:33,040
She always crosses with her grandmother.

2383
02:08:33,030 --> 02:08:41,270
Right, left, right.

2384
02:08:41,260 --> 02:08:48,600
Sae never looked back once.
She looks and walks forward.

2385
02:08:48,970 --> 02:08:51,010
Ah, she crossed.

2386
02:08:58,620 --> 02:09:00,600
She crossed it.

2387
02:09:02,270 --> 02:09:04,910
It's hot.

2388
02:09:04,900 --> 02:09:08,960
Sae broke a good sweat.

2389
02:09:08,950 --> 02:09:18,490
She has a towel in her right for wiping her sweat
in her left pocket she has a towel for tears.

2390
02:09:18,480 --> 02:09:22,630
What are the carving today?
A dragon or a daruma?

2391
02:09:22,620 --> 02:09:27,460
She considered asking them
but she can't today.

2392
02:09:27,450 --> 02:09:37,410
I have to go to Asumo I can't do other things.

2393
02:09:37,400 --> 02:09:40,840
The pink roof is where she is headed.

2394
02:09:40,830 --> 02:09:44,760
I finally approached it.

2395
02:09:45,620 --> 02:09:50,040
Just like mother said, if you go
straight then it's right there.

2396
02:09:50,450 --> 02:09:56,180
I can go by myself. How great. I'm a genius.

2397
02:09:56,170 --> 02:09:58,180
A genius.

2398
02:10:00,320 --> 02:10:04,200
Ah, it's cool. Always great with air condition.

2399
02:10:05,520 --> 02:10:07,600
This is her grandmothers shop.

2400
02:10:07,590 --> 02:10:12,980
Grandma, I brought you the things you forgot.

2401
02:10:12,970 --> 02:10:15,800
She gave it her all just for her grandmother.

2402
02:10:15,790 --> 02:10:18,410
It was beneath the pillow.

2403
02:10:18,400 --> 02:10:20,830
Thank you so much. I was in trouble.

2404
02:10:20,820 --> 02:10:23,560
Grandma, please don't forget.

2405
02:10:23,550 --> 02:10:28,200
Now it's all there. Thank you for bringing it here.

2406
02:10:28,240 --> 02:10:31,020
I will get flowers too.

2407
02:10:28,240 --> 02:10:31,020
Please do.

2408
02:10:31,010 --> 02:10:34,790
In fact, a monk will come visit grandpa house.

2409
02:10:34,780 --> 02:10:37,290
Hello.

2410
02:10:37,280 --> 02:10:39,580
I came by myself.

2411
02:10:39,570 --> 02:10:46,100
Uwa, so many beatiful flowers.
I'm completely at loss.

2412
02:10:46,090 --> 02:10:53,520
Flowers for buddha, they are all made to be similar but it seems like she's found the best one.

2413
02:10:53,510 --> 02:10:55,520
These are cute.

2414
02:10:55,900 --> 02:10:58,680
Flowers for buddha, I will go home with these.

2415
02:10:58,670 --> 02:11:02,130
You dropped your wallet.

2416
02:11:02,120 --> 02:11:04,820
Her important purse given to her by grandma.

2417
02:11:04,810 --> 02:11:07,860
380 yen please.

2418
02:11:08,300 --> 02:11:11,340
She has two 500 yen coins in her wallet.

2419
02:11:11,430 --> 02:11:15,200
Since I'm just a kid I don't know if this is enough.

2420
02:11:15,840 --> 02:11:18,720
Just one 500 yen coin please.

2421
02:11:18,710 --> 02:11:23,280
She always handles the loose change
but today is her first time paying.

2422
02:11:23,270 --> 02:11:28,620
Here you go. Thank you.

2423
02:11:23,270 --> 02:11:28,620
Thank you.

2424
02:11:31,740 --> 02:11:35,410
Ah, it was cool inside.

2425
02:11:36,560 --> 02:11:41,720
It's April and the Hokuriku regions' summer has begun.

2426
02:11:40,560 --> 02:11:43,750
That's right.

2427
02:11:44,770 --> 02:11:48,160
It's become hotter than before.

2428
02:11:54,860 --> 02:11:58,220
Clank clank clank sounds can be heard.

2429
02:11:58,210 --> 02:12:00,400
She's almost home.

2430
02:12:00,390 --> 02:12:02,920
Hot today.

2431
02:12:00,390 --> 02:12:02,920
Yep.

2432
02:12:04,670 --> 02:12:10,280
Everyone watches over her
and that's why she can do her best.

2433
02:12:10,270 --> 02:12:14,260
This town raises and holds children dear.

2434
02:12:14,250 --> 02:12:19,070
That's been going on for years
and is now part of normal life in Inami.

2435
02:12:20,810 --> 02:12:23,220
I'm home.

2436
02:12:23,480 --> 02:12:24,880
Welcome home.

2437
02:12:24,870 --> 02:12:26,500
I was able to do it.

2438
02:12:26,740 --> 02:12:28,580
I was able to go by myself.

2439
02:12:28,570 --> 02:12:30,890
Really? You are remarkable.

2440
02:12:30,400 --> 02:12:32,200
Splendid.

2441
02:12:32,250 --> 02:12:37,140
On my way back it was way hotter than the way over there.

2442
02:12:37,130 --> 02:12:38,860
She's sweating a lot.

2443
02:12:38,070 --> 02:12:38,850
Was it fun?

2444
02:12:38,840 --> 02:12:40,450
It was fun.

2445
02:12:40,470 --> 02:12:42,710
So it was fun.

2446
02:12:43,050 --> 02:12:47,770
Which is why the mother conceived a second errand.

2447
02:12:47,760 --> 02:12:58,050
She will go visit the temple to call the monk over to their home so that she can pray at their home altar.

2448
02:12:58,040 --> 02:13:05,110
There are many temples in Inami so her mother is trying to give her clear directions.

2449
02:13:05,100 --> 02:13:14,140
If you go this way, on the right side there is a spinning blue and red thing, right?

2450
02:13:14,160 --> 02:13:17,960
It's a spinning barber's pole.

2451
02:13:18,010 --> 02:13:21,380
With it to your back you will have the temple in front of you.

2452
02:13:22,320 --> 02:13:23,890
Butsugon temple.

2453
02:13:24,550 --> 02:13:27,590
It is. You understand?

2454
02:13:24,550 --> 02:13:27,590
Oh, that one?

2455
02:13:28,050 --> 02:13:30,100
Alright. Got it.

2456
02:13:30,090 --> 02:13:33,860
Good, good, good, good, gooooood.

2457
02:13:31,210 --> 02:13:33,390
Nice smile.

2458
02:13:34,630 --> 02:13:36,150
I will head off.

2459
02:13:36,140 --> 02:13:41,040
My life is so full of errands.

2460
02:13:58,000 --> 02:14:02,710
My life is so full of errands.

2461
02:14:02,150 --> 02:14:03,980
What's up with this song.

2462
02:14:03,340 --> 02:14:11,560
This isn't her first errand, it's her second.
She's looking for the spinning barber's pole.

2463
02:14:11,550 --> 02:14:18,040
Spinning spinning, where are you? Spinning.

2464
02:14:18,510 --> 02:14:24,230
Ah, it's there. Seems like it's their day off.

2465
02:14:25,020 --> 02:14:26,260
She passed it by.

2466
02:14:25,690 --> 02:14:28,130
Was hard to see.

2467
02:14:28,120 --> 02:14:31,960
And that's right this is the temple.

2468
02:14:32,870 --> 02:14:36,370
The cameraman races ahead of her.

2469
02:14:36,760 --> 02:14:38,410
Wait, she stopped.

2470
02:14:41,360 --> 02:14:43,270
She turned back.

2471
02:14:45,120 --> 02:14:55,810
That's odd. Her mother mentioned this spinning pole but it's quite inconspicuous.

2472
02:14:55,810 --> 02:15:00,050
Why can't this errand veteran see it?

2473
02:15:00,060 --> 02:15:04,300
Mother, it wasn't spinning at all.

2474
02:15:05,550 --> 02:15:08,530
Even if it isn't spinning that's the right one.

2475
02:15:08,550 --> 02:15:10,960
I stood with it to my back.

2476
02:15:10,950 --> 02:15:12,290
Was there a temple?

2477
02:15:12,280 --> 02:15:19,540
There was but there are temples here and there so I wouldn't know.

2478
02:15:19,530 --> 02:15:21,700
She really gave it her all.

2479
02:15:20,730 --> 02:15:23,190
Cause that's what kind of town it is.

2480
02:15:23,180 --> 02:15:24,630
I will tell you.

2481
02:15:24,620 --> 02:15:28,820
I will put this on you.

2482
02:15:28,840 --> 02:15:32,450
She put a glittering bracelet on her right hand.

2483
02:15:32,730 --> 02:15:35,250
Do this and it's the temple on the left.

2484
02:15:35,240 --> 02:15:37,310
To the right of the spinning pole.

2485
02:15:37,300 --> 02:15:39,810
Do you understand?

2486
02:15:37,300 --> 02:15:39,810
I understand.

2487
02:15:39,800 --> 02:15:43,530
Did you see it though it wasn't spinning?

2488
02:15:43,520 --> 02:15:45,970
It wasn't spinning.

2489
02:15:45,960 --> 02:15:50,890
I thought it would but it's their day off today. I'm sorry.

2490
02:15:50,880 --> 02:15:53,700
Mother, you were slightly bad.

2491
02:15:54,200 --> 02:15:55,280
That's right.

2492
02:15:55,280 --> 02:15:58,010
This errands veteran is ready to departure.

2493
02:15:58,000 --> 02:16:01,950
Okay, I've understood.

2494
02:15:58,000 --> 02:16:01,950
Say "excuse me" in a loud voice.

2495
02:16:02,440 --> 02:16:04,630
I'm fine.

2496
02:16:02,440 --> 02:16:04,630
You will fall if you run.

2497
02:16:10,300 --> 02:16:19,750
She can do it if she understands what. That's Sae's good point. But she is getting tired. This is her second errand today after all.

2498
02:16:18,770 --> 02:16:19,750
And it's hot.

2499
02:16:20,330 --> 02:16:23,060
Alright, she has arrived in front of the pole.

2500
02:16:24,730 --> 02:16:26,850
It's fine even if it doesn't spin.

2501
02:16:27,210 --> 02:16:34,180
With it to your back there is a temple on the right and one on the left. Which one is it?

2502
02:16:31,140 --> 02:16:33,810
- So that's what it was.
- That's hard to discern.

2503
02:16:34,280 --> 02:16:38,270
According to the bracelet that her mother put on her.

2504
02:16:39,930 --> 02:16:41,110
This one?

2505
02:16:41,100 --> 02:16:47,100
That's right. The temple on the right. The Butsugon temple.

2506
02:16:46,560 --> 02:16:48,680
Glad she got it.

2507
02:16:49,460 --> 02:16:53,250
This is her first time alone at a temple.

2508
02:16:51,740 --> 02:16:55,710
- Scary to be alone at a temple.
- It is scary.

2509
02:16:56,740 --> 02:16:59,430
Straight to the main building.

2510
02:17:01,630 --> 02:17:08,330
One step at a time. The talkative Sae is really quiet right now.

2511
02:17:12,560 --> 02:17:14,370
Excuse me.

2512
02:17:14,360 --> 02:17:17,800
She calls out with a loud voice.

2513
02:17:21,200 --> 02:17:23,420
No one comes out.

2514
02:17:24,290 --> 02:17:27,410
She won't cry. She won't be perturbed.

2515
02:17:27,450 --> 02:17:28,970
Excuse me.

2516
02:17:29,090 --> 02:17:33,050
She calls out in an even louder voice this time.

2517
02:17:33,310 --> 02:17:37,590
But no one comes out.

2518
02:17:35,260 --> 02:17:37,330
Why not?

2519
02:17:43,950 --> 02:17:47,400
There's also a building over there.

2520
02:17:47,900 --> 02:17:53,560
That's right. This is the building where the monk lives which is also called Kuri.

2521
02:17:53,550 --> 02:17:55,480
The door is open.

2522
02:17:55,470 --> 02:18:02,760
If she goes inside and calls out loudly then the monk will come out but she doesn't go in.

2523
02:18:02,750 --> 02:18:06,680
She can't bring herself forward.

2524
02:18:06,880 --> 02:18:10,520
It's dark inside and smells heavily of incense.

2525
02:18:13,430 --> 02:18:17,930
Since this is the way she better
fight through the scary feeling.

2526
02:18:17,920 --> 02:18:23,530
The bracelet her mother gave her is her only support.

2527
02:18:23,520 --> 02:18:26,970
Alright, I will head in. At that moment...

2528
02:18:31,410 --> 02:18:35,300
Alright, I will head in. At that moment...

2529
02:18:39,690 --> 02:18:43,250
The bracelet broke.

2530
02:18:44,860 --> 02:18:50,600
She picks up the beads but she can't fix it.

2531
02:18:54,680 --> 02:18:57,960
Sae, is this all too much?

2532
02:19:00,620 --> 02:19:08,440
She won't go home. These are all new
experiences for the 4 year old Sae.

2533
02:19:08,430 --> 02:19:11,010
And then this expression.

2534
02:19:23,120 --> 02:19:25,060
Excuse me.

2535
02:19:27,650 --> 02:19:29,460
Excuse me.

2536
02:19:29,500 --> 02:19:31,010
Yes.

2537
02:19:30,940 --> 02:19:32,740
Thankfully.

2538
02:19:35,560 --> 02:19:36,910
Who's there?

2539
02:19:36,900 --> 02:19:40,010
From within the dark someone approaches.

2540
02:19:40,000 --> 02:19:41,640
Isn't this Sae?

2541
02:19:41,630 --> 02:19:42,290
Yes.

2542
02:19:42,280 --> 02:19:45,130
But it's a familiar face.

2543
02:19:47,080 --> 02:19:48,490
This is the monk.

2544
02:19:48,480 --> 02:19:51,240
Please sit down.

2545
02:19:51,230 --> 02:19:52,610
What's wrong?

2546
02:19:52,600 --> 02:19:54,480
Here.

2547
02:19:52,600 --> 02:19:54,480
I will receive this.

2548
02:19:54,470 --> 02:19:56,520
It's a gift for Buddha.

2549
02:19:58,730 --> 02:20:05,000
I called you but you were a bit slow so I was wandering around.

2550
02:20:05,210 --> 02:20:07,250
- Slow?
- She was slow.

2551
02:20:07,690 --> 02:20:10,610
Please forgive me for being slow.

2552
02:20:10,600 --> 02:20:11,680
It's alright.

2553
02:20:11,670 --> 02:20:14,430
Is it? I see.

2554
02:20:14,420 --> 02:20:16,760
Let's go right away.

2555
02:20:16,750 --> 02:20:19,170
This errand was a success.

2556
02:20:19,160 --> 02:20:26,600
I was on so many errands today.
I came to visit Buddha and I...

2557
02:20:26,590 --> 02:20:30,630
The words burst out of her in one go.

2558
02:20:31,680 --> 02:20:37,990
Yesterday I went to the ocean.

2559
02:20:37,980 --> 02:20:41,860
Which ocean? I forgot that.

2560
02:20:41,860 --> 02:20:42,610
You forgo..

2561
02:20:42,600 --> 02:20:45,880
My father played soooo much with me.

2562
02:20:45,870 --> 02:20:46,390
I see.

2563
02:20:46,380 --> 02:20:54,530
My little brother was with me.
And mother. We were four all in all.

2564
02:20:55,400 --> 02:20:59,860
Now we all know what Sae has been doing all week.

2565
02:21:02,570 --> 02:21:04,450
I'm home.

2566
02:21:04,510 --> 02:21:06,310
Sae, did you do your best?

2567
02:21:10,240 --> 02:21:13,310
I chose pink carnations.

2568
02:21:13,300 --> 02:21:16,010
Flowers from her first errand.

2569
02:21:17,260 --> 02:21:21,000
The monk from the second errand.

2570
02:21:20,990 --> 02:21:27,670
Breaking a sweat from all the hard work and deep in prayer, her grandpa would be proud.

2571
02:21:29,960 --> 02:21:35,770
Having fought through two errands
she now fights off sleepiness.

2572
02:21:40,220 --> 02:21:44,440
This was Sae who loves giving her all.

2573
02:21:42,400 --> 02:21:45,200
She really did.

2574
02:21:50,320 --> 02:21:53,090
11 years later.

2575
02:21:53,320 --> 02:21:57,050
The place we are meeting with Sae...

2576
02:21:57,430 --> 02:22:01,860
Is this an outdoor stage? No no.

2577
02:22:01,850 --> 02:22:07,160
The girl wearing the aqua green is climbing the wall.

2578
02:22:08,110 --> 02:22:10,270
It's Sae.

2579
02:22:10,760 --> 02:22:17,150
Sae who still loves to give it her all is now in 3rd year of middle school where she's a rock climber.

2580
02:22:17,140 --> 02:22:21,560
In elementary school she came 3rd in her prefecture within the C-class.

2581
02:22:21,550 --> 02:22:24,660
In first year of middle school she became the first in B-class in the prefecture.

2582
02:22:24,650 --> 02:22:32,370
She also won a second place in another bouldering competition.

2583
02:22:31,220 --> 02:22:33,130
Amazing.

2584
02:22:32,420 --> 02:22:38,410
And this spring she became number one in her prefecture in the group of young girls.

2585
02:22:38,400 --> 02:22:41,240
A little more and she will win in the Kanto region.

2586
02:22:43,260 --> 02:22:46,510
She fell.

2587
02:22:43,260 --> 02:22:46,510
So tough.

2588
02:22:48,310 --> 02:22:55,350
She puts chalk on her hands from her bag and goes straight back to it without a break for her muscles.

2589
02:22:55,340 --> 02:22:57,680
That was all the break she got.

2590
02:22:57,670 --> 02:23:00,290
Taking the place she failed as a new challenge.

2591
02:23:00,280 --> 02:23:04,170
She grows strong from all the climbing.

2592
02:23:04,160 --> 02:23:07,990
This time she climbs only using the red stones.

2593
02:23:07,980 --> 02:23:13,860
She has accomplished it when she attaches her rope to the clip above.

2594
02:23:16,640 --> 02:23:18,380
She did it.

2595
02:23:18,410 --> 02:23:20,570
Please lower me.

2596
02:23:20,970 --> 02:23:26,810
We asked Sae about why she becomes so perfectly focused while climbing.

2597
02:23:26,800 --> 02:23:32,720
I love the feeling after I've accomplished a climb.

2598
02:23:32,710 --> 02:23:41,170
As I become able to climb more difficult ones I become so happy that I just can't stop doing it.

2599
02:23:41,160 --> 02:23:44,870
What kind of child has she become?

2600
02:23:45,240 --> 02:23:47,290
I wonder...

2601
02:23:47,280 --> 02:23:51,160
I might not have changed that much after all.

2602
02:23:53,370 --> 02:23:57,510
I still love to excel in everything.

2603
02:23:57,500 --> 02:24:01,360
And I never stopped breaking a sweat.

2604
02:24:02,280 --> 02:24:04,180
Please.

2605
02:24:04,180 --> 02:24:07,540
Always outperforms on her second try.

2606
02:24:07,530 --> 02:24:10,960
Now she only climbs on the green stones.

2607
02:24:10,950 --> 02:24:17,440
Her closest goal is to pass to the National Athletic Meet and perform well there.

2608
02:24:16,080 --> 02:24:17,440
Scary.

2609
02:24:17,430 --> 02:24:21,970
And then she hopes to do well at the Junior Olympics.

2610
02:24:22,190 --> 02:24:25,800
She also accomplished it in her second try.

2611
02:24:27,440 --> 02:24:29,570
Please lower me.

2612
02:24:29,570 --> 02:24:36,670
She does this all by herself. She has developed a splendid view of the world.

2613
02:24:36,660 --> 02:24:39,530
What does she want to be when she grows up?

2614
02:24:39,530 --> 02:24:49,110
I love science so either sports science or nutritional science. That would be a lot of fun.

2615
02:24:49,150 --> 02:24:53,400
This was Sae who is radiant from all her hard work.
