1
00:00:00,500 --> 00:00:02,840
First time ever on Gaki no Tsukai ya Arahende

2
00:00:02,840 --> 00:00:06,520
Chidori Daigo Shichi Henge!

3
00:00:08,700 --> 00:00:11,000
Your voice was amazing

4
00:00:11,000 --> 00:00:12,740
Shichi hengeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeee

5
00:00:13,000 --> 00:00:16,000
It was dragged out

6
00:00:14,700 --> 00:00:16,000
What the hell?!

7
00:00:16,000 --> 00:00:17,600
I thought it was incredible

8
00:00:17,600 --> 00:00:20,820
It has been 4 months since the last challenger Haruna

9
00:00:20,830 --> 00:00:24,490
This is our 38th challenger

10
00:00:24,940 --> 00:00:27,490
Please come in!

11
00:00:27,490 --> 00:00:31,650
Thank you for having us today

12
00:00:32,160 --> 00:00:34,400
During last year's M-1 contest

13
00:00:34,400 --> 00:00:37,550
*Chidori literally means "thousand birds"

14
00:00:34,400 --> 00:00:37,550
The flying bird Chidori crashed*

15
00:00:37,550 --> 00:00:40,040
No, we're not crashed

16
00:00:40,040 --> 00:00:43,920
Chidori was flying on the right track, but ended up crashing

17
00:00:43,920 --> 00:00:45,520
Well, yes, we lost the contest

18
00:00:45,520 --> 00:00:49,740
After that, my hands go numb whenever I see Hamakan

19
00:00:50,460 --> 00:00:55,260
Well, for today, Daigo is the one who will challenge, right?

20
00:00:53,120 --> 00:00:55,260
Yes, Daigo will be challenging today

21
00:00:55,260 --> 00:00:56,100
Look, Hamada-san

22
00:00:56,100 --> 00:01:01,300
After my manager told me about the offer for Shichi-henge, this thing came out the next day

23
00:01:01,300 --> 00:01:02,930
Yes, exactly

24
00:01:02,930 --> 00:01:04,510
And it's so big

25
00:01:04,510 --> 00:01:06,250
That's strange

26
00:01:06,250 --> 00:01:09,500
So if you can do well, it will probably be healed

27
00:01:11,500 --> 00:01:13,070
That's the main point today

28
00:01:13,070 --> 00:01:15,500
These are the past results

29
00:01:15,500 --> 00:01:17,680
Which position are you aiming for?

30
00:01:18,720 --> 00:01:21,720
If possible, of course I want to aim the best ten

31
00:01:21,720 --> 00:01:26,050
Yes, of course, it's good to dream big

32
00:01:26,060 --> 00:01:29,540
Is he sober now?

33
00:01:29,540 --> 00:01:33,840
Eh? He drank?

34
00:01:31,100 --> 00:01:33,840
Hey dude! How dare you drink on this important day?

35
00:01:34,200 --> 00:01:36,900
Who said I drank on this important day for Shichi Henge?

36
00:01:36,900 --> 00:01:37,680
You look drunk

37
00:01:37,680 --> 00:01:40,220
I told you I didn't! Do you mean I smell like alcohol?

38
00:01:40,220 --> 00:01:41,160
Yes, you smell!

39
00:01:41,160 --> 00:01:42,220
Check it out then

40
00:01:42,780 --> 00:01:44,240
He simply have bad breath

41
00:01:44,240 --> 00:01:45,640
I have an upset stomach

42
00:01:45,640 --> 00:01:50,540
Okay, so let's get started, Daigo's Shichi Henge!

43
00:01:51,030 --> 00:01:53,060
No one is laughing at this gag anymore

44
00:01:52,060 --> 00:01:53,060
It's okay, just do it

45
00:02:05,640 --> 00:02:08,240
So which one should we choose?

46
00:02:07,200 --> 00:02:08,240
Which one should we choose?

47
00:02:08,240 --> 00:02:10,400
There's a whole lot of ideas on there

48
00:02:10,400 --> 00:02:13,450
I'm most curious about the last one though

49
00:02:13,450 --> 00:02:15,360
Heipo's deep-sea documentary!

50
00:02:15,360 --> 00:02:17,480
A miracle two shot with the Giant squid

51
00:02:17,480 --> 00:02:19,740
If we can do this, that gotta be amazing

52
00:02:19,740 --> 00:02:22,020
How deep do you mean "deep-sea"?

53
00:02:22,020 --> 00:02:23,820
Around 600 to 800 meters

54
00:02:23,820 --> 00:02:26,120
It lives at those places

55
00:02:26,120 --> 00:02:27,760
How deep can you dive?

56
00:02:27,760 --> 00:02:29,510
About 10 meters

57
00:02:29,510 --> 00:02:32,440
Really? 10 meters?

58
00:02:32,440 --> 00:02:34,440
I dived in this show before, right?

59
00:02:34,680 --> 00:02:36,940
It's scary to dive even just 5 meters

60
00:02:36,200 --> 00:02:36,940
Yeah, exactly

61
00:02:36,940 --> 00:02:39,500
When you dived during the matchmaking before, it was just about one meter

62
00:02:39,500 --> 00:02:42,620
No way, I thought it was 10 meters

63
00:02:41,300 --> 00:02:42,620
How could that be possible

64
00:02:43,300 --> 00:02:45,780
Why did you matchmake under the water though?

65
00:02:46,140 --> 00:02:49,600
Because you guys asked him to do so!!

66
00:02:49,600 --> 00:02:55,880
Yes, you're right, I remember it now

67
00:03:21,420 --> 00:03:23,740
Oh, come on

68
00:03:24,420 --> 00:03:34,560
Don't stand out to sea when the waves are so high

69
00:03:34,920 --> 00:03:42,060
How dare you sail off when the waves are so high? That's just ridiculous!

70
00:03:42,060 --> 00:03:44,360
I told him not to do so

71
00:03:44,360 --> 00:03:54,310
I told him to take a rest, but he insists to stand out to sea

72
00:03:54,520 --> 00:03:56,250
I really tried to stop him

73
00:03:56,250 --> 00:03:58,920
But then he said to me

74
00:03:59,260 --> 00:04:00,920
"Why the heck, dude!"

75
00:04:00,920 --> 00:04:03,660
"If I say I want to stand out to sea, then it has nothing to do with the weather"

76
00:04:03,660 --> 00:04:07,060
Come on, when the weather is bad, we should just do this instead

77
00:04:07,060 --> 00:04:08,860
We should just pick the Shakos (a species of mantis shrimp)

78
00:04:09,290 --> 00:04:11,200
And stay safe

79
00:04:12,320 --> 00:04:16,220
(No one has laughed after five minutes.)

80
00:04:12,320 --> 00:04:16,220
Maybe you'll earn a lot, but that's bothering others

81
00:04:19,120 --> 00:04:23,240
Just pick the Shakos, when the weather is bad, just pick the Shakos

82
00:04:26,240 --> 00:04:28,240
Oh, it's a girl

83
00:04:30,080 --> 00:04:32,180
Isn't this a girl

84
00:04:32,180 --> 00:04:34,620
This is a girl

85
00:04:35,650 --> 00:04:36,860
This is a girl too

86
00:04:36,860 --> 00:04:39,480
These are all boys

87
00:04:40,350 --> 00:04:42,500
It's all boys

88
00:04:45,680 --> 00:04:48,560
Only a few girls over here

89
00:05:00,300 --> 00:05:04,980
Of course, yes of course, I know

90
00:05:04,980 --> 00:05:06,980
Of course, yes of course

91
00:05:06,980 --> 00:05:11,120
Everything (gags) flew out of my mind

92
00:05:12,740 --> 00:05:17,660
You are dirty!

93
00:05:15,420 --> 00:05:17,660
That's cunning

94
00:05:18,750 --> 00:05:21,000
Just get out of here, dude!

95
00:05:21,000 --> 00:05:23,000
I've been practicing this for a long time

96
00:05:23,000 --> 00:05:25,450
And I've prepared so many Shakos

97
00:05:27,540 --> 00:05:30,000
I'm not paying this penalty.

98
00:05:30,140 --> 00:05:32,920
We don't need to pay for this

99
00:05:32,920 --> 00:05:37,140
He didn't make us laugh

100
00:05:37,140 --> 00:05:41,140
He forgot about his gag

101
00:05:38,880 --> 00:05:41,140
This counts as one of the Shichi Henge

102
00:05:41,650 --> 00:05:43,660
But we don't need to pay for it

103
00:05:43,660 --> 00:05:46,260
He said "everything flew out of his mind"

104
00:05:46,260 --> 00:05:51,920
But that probably relieved his stress

105
00:05:47,930 --> 00:05:51,920
Yeah, you're right, he should feel relaxed now

106
00:06:12,800 --> 00:06:14,340
Isn't the steering wheel reversed?

107
00:06:19,740 --> 00:06:21,740
What the hell!

108
00:06:21,740 --> 00:06:23,740
That's cunning

109
00:06:32,140 --> 00:06:35,040
Hey, yo. Hey, yo.

110
00:06:35,040 --> 00:06:36,980
Thank you for riding with me

111
00:06:36,980 --> 00:06:39,180
I'm the road safety driver, Ika Kawari

112
00:06:40,720 --> 00:06:43,540
Where are you going? Nippon Television?

113
00:06:43,540 --> 00:06:44,900
Thank you very much

114
00:06:44,900 --> 00:06:48,150
Please let me drive safely, I'm the Ika Kawari

115
00:06:48,600 --> 00:06:51,360
By the way, are you always appearing on TV shows?

116
00:06:51,360 --> 00:06:52,100
Yes

117
00:06:52,100 --> 00:06:54,420
I knew it, I saw you on TV before

118
00:06:54,420 --> 00:06:56,620
Thank you

119
00:06:56,620 --> 00:06:58,620
You're that person, right?

120
00:06:59,450 --> 00:07:00,800
You're a wrestler, right?

121
00:07:02,500 --> 00:07:04,940
No I'm not, I'm not

122
00:07:04,940 --> 00:07:07,370
You're Koike Eiko's husband, right?*

123
00:07:04,940 --> 00:07:09,370
*Koike Eiko's husband, Wataru Sakata, is a Japanese professional wrestler and former mixed martial artist

124
00:07:07,370 --> 00:07:09,370
I'm not, no

125
00:07:09,820 --> 00:07:11,880
I saw you on TV before

126
00:07:10,880 --> 00:07:11,880
We don't look alike at all

127
00:07:11,880 --> 00:07:12,840
Oh, really?

128
00:07:12,840 --> 00:07:18,880
But anyway, I bet you met a lot of famous people, right?

129
00:07:18,880 --> 00:07:21,980
I met a famous person recently

130
00:07:21,160 --> 00:07:21,980
Okay

131
00:07:21,980 --> 00:07:24,800
When I was on the Shinkansen

132
00:07:25,500 --> 00:07:28,020
You know, I always smoke

133
00:07:28,020 --> 00:07:29,330
I don't know

134
00:07:28,020 --> 00:07:31,660
So I went to the smoking room

135
00:07:31,660 --> 00:07:37,660
And then, I saw a skinny gangster there

136
00:07:37,660 --> 00:07:40,450
And I thought "Dang, there's a gangster"

137
00:07:40,450 --> 00:07:44,040
And you know, smoking rooms are really small

138
00:07:44,060 --> 00:07:47,580
And I thought "I don't wanna stay here alone with a gangster"

139
00:07:47,580 --> 00:07:49,580
So I didn't smoke

140
00:07:49,600 --> 00:07:53,900
But when I went back, you know, I still want to smoke

141
00:07:53,900 --> 00:07:55,860
So I went to the smoking room again

142
00:07:55,860 --> 00:07:59,230
And that skinny gangster was still there

143
00:07:59,230 --> 00:08:04,160
Although that skinny gangster was still there, but I thought "Anyway! I just want to smoke!", and I entered the room

144
00:08:04,160 --> 00:08:08,700
*Ken Naoko is a Japanese singer and actress, and is well known for her comedy roles featuring idiosyncratic looks

145
00:08:04,160 --> 00:08:08,700
And I found out that the skinny gangster, was actually Ken Naoko-san*

146
00:08:09,020 --> 00:08:11,170
And I thought "Wow, it's Ken Naoko-san!"

147
00:08:11,170 --> 00:08:15,690
She sure looks like a skinny gangster

148
00:08:15,690 --> 00:08:17,080
That really surprised me

149
00:08:18,870 --> 00:08:21,520
Here's another famous person, huh?

150
00:08:22,040 --> 00:08:25,420
What happened? You seem to be in a bad mood?

151
00:08:24,640 --> 00:08:25,420
No, I'm not

152
00:08:25,660 --> 00:08:28,400
*Kawagoe Tatsuya is well known for being the most handsome chef with an arrogant look

153
00:08:25,660 --> 00:08:28,400
You're Kawagoe Chef, right?*

154
00:08:29,820 --> 00:08:32,620
I really like you

155
00:08:32,620 --> 00:08:34,840
I always watch your TV shows

156
00:08:37,510 --> 00:08:40,800
We arrived. It's the Tennoji Zoo

157
00:08:50,680 --> 00:08:53,640
That was quite good

158
00:08:53,640 --> 00:08:58,780
The first one was terrible

159
00:08:59,160 --> 00:09:04,140
But he's getting into the swing of things

160
00:09:06,600 --> 00:09:09,700
If there's another chance...

161
00:09:27,860 --> 00:09:29,660
*Daigo's comedy routines involve made-up words with no meaning

162
00:09:27,860 --> 00:09:29,660
Hene

163
00:09:37,320 --> 00:09:39,360
The point

164
00:09:51,280 --> 00:09:52,720
Red Hene

165
00:09:57,040 --> 00:09:59,320
The point

166
00:10:05,420 --> 00:10:09,420
Yo-noyo-nomoisu (More made-up words)

167
00:10:14,400 --> 00:10:15,640
Hene

168
00:10:18,280 --> 00:10:22,520
Yo-noyo-nomoisu

169
00:10:22,900 --> 00:10:25,340
Hene

170
00:10:27,160 --> 00:10:29,060
Red Hene

171
00:10:32,520 --> 00:10:34,520
Tao!

172
00:10:32,520 --> 00:10:38,800
*Yasushi Tao is a Japanese retired Nippon Professional Baseball player

173
00:10:37,420 --> 00:10:38,800
Tao.

174
00:10:44,580 --> 00:10:50,040
Wow, nice, that was nice

175
00:10:53,000 --> 00:10:54,920
That was a perfect timing

176
00:10:55,840 --> 00:10:57,880
I'm curious about the last side though

177
00:10:57,880 --> 00:11:01,190
Yeah, the black side

178
00:10:58,180 --> 00:11:04,320
To be revealed at the end of the show!!

179
00:11:01,190 --> 00:11:04,310
But finally, he's getting us to pay

180
00:11:04,310 --> 00:11:05,900
That one was good

181
00:11:05,900 --> 00:11:07,910
You don't know him? He's Tao

182
00:11:07,910 --> 00:11:09,910
Tao.

183
00:11:36,660 --> 00:11:40,800
Yes. When those things happen, just call this phone number

184
00:11:40,800 --> 00:11:44,260
Yes, I'm the representative, Maya

185
00:11:44,900 --> 00:11:46,900
Iriomote Maya

186
00:11:48,060 --> 00:11:51,580
So how is it going? Is there anymore? There's two more?

187
00:11:52,300 --> 00:11:52,990
Oh, I see.

188
00:11:52,990 --> 00:11:55,730
And you want to bring both of them here?

189
00:11:55,740 --> 00:11:57,840
Then bring both of them

190
00:11:57,840 --> 00:11:59,840
How does it looks like?

191
00:11:59,900 --> 00:12:04,060
One of them was at your home, and you got the other one recently

192
00:12:04,700 --> 00:12:05,670
Oh, I see.

193
00:12:05,670 --> 00:12:08,480
I have seven times two, fourteen now

194
00:12:10,480 --> 00:12:13,940
Adding it all up, there's sixteen now

195
00:12:13,940 --> 00:12:16,830
No problem, no problem at all

196
00:12:16,880 --> 00:12:20,790
You're working in the daytime, so let's meet late at night

197
00:12:20,790 --> 00:12:22,790
How about during lunch time?

198
00:12:23,400 --> 00:12:26,880
Okay, so bring both of them and let's meet at noon

199
00:12:26,880 --> 00:12:30,220
No, it's not embarrassing at all

200
00:12:30,220 --> 00:12:37,320
It's not embarrassing at all for young girls to sell honeycombs

201
00:12:37,820 --> 00:12:40,670
Oh, so you don't trust Maya at all yet, huh?

202
00:12:40,670 --> 00:12:44,640
Okay, I see, because it's the first time we've talked with each other

203
00:12:44,840 --> 00:12:47,700
So you don't know Maya at all

204
00:12:47,960 --> 00:12:52,130
Maya is riding in a tiny Lexus now

205
00:12:52,130 --> 00:12:54,130
A red and tiny Lexus

206
00:12:55,300 --> 00:12:58,520
So you can definitely trust me

207
00:12:58,680 --> 00:13:03,680
See you! Yes, yes, okay

208
00:13:06,020 --> 00:13:09,050
He shouldn't have said it's "honeycombs"

209
00:13:10,600 --> 00:13:14,140
Yeah, Hamada thinks that way

210
00:13:14,130 --> 00:13:17,220
I didn't laugh at all after that

211
00:13:17,220 --> 00:13:22,600
I knew that, when he said "honeycombs", I was like "Ahh, Hamada's gonna hate it"

212
00:13:25,340 --> 00:13:30,820
Hamada don't like gags with a clear conclusion

213
00:13:31,440 --> 00:13:34,380
Hamada's home is too big to visit

214
00:13:39,380 --> 00:13:42,040
Stop! Please!

215
00:13:45,180 --> 00:13:49,160
Help me! Ken!!

216
00:14:02,400 --> 00:14:04,140
This is cunning!

217
00:14:03,600 --> 00:14:06,580
Downtown's coworker

218
00:14:03,600 --> 00:14:06,580
Tomizu Ken

219
00:14:06,580 --> 00:14:08,700
Ken-chan powder

220
00:14:08,700 --> 00:14:09,880
What the heck is that?

221
00:14:09,880 --> 00:14:13,540
If you got sprinkled by this powder, you will become a boring person!

222
00:14:15,830 --> 00:14:19,340
Ma-chan, Hama-chan, here I am!

223
00:14:19,340 --> 00:14:27,480
Ken-chan, here I am!

224
00:14:24,740 --> 00:14:27,480
Ken-san, Ken-san, Ken-san

225
00:14:27,480 --> 00:14:30,750
Don't say things like Ma-chan, Hama-chan

226
00:14:30,750 --> 00:14:32,480
Why did you say those things?

227
00:14:32,560 --> 00:14:35,480
Because we haven't seen each other for a long time

228
00:14:33,460 --> 00:14:35,480
I understand that, but...

229
00:14:35,480 --> 00:14:40,260
Yes, so that's just a little improvisation!!

230
00:14:38,630 --> 00:14:40,260
Don't shout at me!

231
00:14:42,140 --> 00:14:43,400
Why did you say that?

232
00:14:43,400 --> 00:14:45,400
Sorry, you guys can leave

233
00:14:46,000 --> 00:14:48,630
If you say things like "Ma-chan, Hama-chan"

234
00:14:48,630 --> 00:14:52,140
Then everything (gags) after that becomes wasted, am I right?

235
00:14:52,140 --> 00:14:53,900
Oh, is it?

236
00:14:53,900 --> 00:14:55,600
What do you mean "is it?", of course it is

237
00:14:55,600 --> 00:14:57,850
Anyway! There's no need to tell me about this here, right?

238
00:14:57,850 --> 00:15:01,380
I've been working so hard to come up with these gags, what's wrong with you, dude!

239
00:15:01,380 --> 00:15:05,820
Hey! You better not talk to me like this, that's impolite

240
00:15:05,820 --> 00:15:12,820
Who cares if it's impolite, you've ruined all of my gags

241
00:15:09,560 --> 00:15:12,820
Will you talk to Hama-chan and Ma-chan like this, dude!

242
00:15:12,820 --> 00:15:14,830
No, I won't

243
00:15:14,280 --> 00:15:14,830
Of course you won't

244
00:15:14,830 --> 00:15:16,780
Yeah, of course I won't

245
00:15:16,780 --> 00:15:19,720
You're just acting differently with different people

246
00:15:18,240 --> 00:15:19,720
Of course I am!

247
00:15:19,960 --> 00:15:21,720
What are you even capable of?

248
00:15:22,040 --> 00:15:23,990
I can do a whole lot of gags

249
00:15:24,260 --> 00:15:25,140
Do it then

250
00:15:25,140 --> 00:15:26,790
How do you feel? (Gen-ki)

251
00:15:26,790 --> 00:15:28,910
I feel sick (Byou-ki)

252
00:15:29,170 --> 00:15:30,620
That's it

253
00:15:30,620 --> 00:15:32,180
Stop saying that phrase

254
00:15:32,560 --> 00:15:36,640
Stop saying "that's it", it's becoming a habit

255
00:15:37,040 --> 00:15:40,680
King Kong Kang Ken-chan!

256
00:15:42,860 --> 00:15:45,620
What's wrong with you? How should others react to that?

257
00:15:45,880 --> 00:15:50,170
How have you been a comedian for this long?

258
00:15:50,170 --> 00:15:51,280
That's too harsh

259
00:15:51,280 --> 00:15:55,060
You're even living in a decent home, how have you been a comedian for this long?

260
00:15:55,730 --> 00:15:59,190
We're visiting the same dentist in Osaka

261
00:15:59,200 --> 00:16:02,220
What do you expect from us for saying that?

262
00:16:02,220 --> 00:16:05,200
We're visiting the same dentist?

263
00:16:05,200 --> 00:16:08,680
Matsumoto-san probably didn't talk about this shit for decades

264
00:16:08,680 --> 00:16:14,140
That's enough! Come on! Just tell me about this afterwards!

265
00:16:14,140 --> 00:16:15,280
That thing

266
00:16:14,680 --> 00:16:16,140
What do you mean?

267
00:16:16,480 --> 00:16:17,840
"I'm gonna tell Masa about this"

268
00:16:17,840 --> 00:16:19,310
Oh yeah...I'm gonna tell Masa about this

269
00:16:19,310 --> 00:16:21,510
Too late, come on

270
00:16:22,100 --> 00:16:23,980
Anyway, just leave

271
00:16:23,980 --> 00:16:25,380
That's it

272
00:16:25,380 --> 00:16:27,010
That's the only thing

273
00:16:27,020 --> 00:16:29,790
That's the only thing that I've asked you to say

274
00:16:29,790 --> 00:16:31,790
And you never remember that

275
00:16:32,520 --> 00:16:34,490
I'm nervous too, you idiot

276
00:16:34,490 --> 00:16:38,020
No need to add that

277
00:16:39,200 --> 00:16:41,420
Ahh, that really surprised me

278
00:16:41,420 --> 00:16:44,040
Can't believe that Tomizu Ken-san really came here

279
00:16:44,040 --> 00:16:46,280
Downtown's coworker

280
00:16:46,280 --> 00:16:47,970
What was that "Ken-chan powder"?

281
00:16:47,970 --> 00:16:52,660
It's a gag that if you got sprinkled by the Ken-chan powder, then you'll become a boring person too

282
00:16:52,660 --> 00:16:54,600
Like some negative power

283
00:16:54,600 --> 00:16:56,180
Okay, I see

284
00:16:56,180 --> 00:16:59,020
He's always doing that gag in Osaka

285
00:16:59,020 --> 00:17:03,060
His voice was loud and clear though

286
00:19:51,680 --> 00:19:56,460
A moment ago...a moment ago...

287
00:20:03,530 --> 00:20:05,500
He's about to finish

288
00:20:19,540 --> 00:20:20,770
Next one's the last one, right?

289
00:20:20,770 --> 00:20:24,470
Isn't it better to make that gag the last one? Look at his face

290
00:20:25,080 --> 00:20:27,600
Exactly, he need to remove makeup

291
00:20:27,600 --> 00:20:33,740
Maybe he'll bring out the big guns in the end

292
00:20:45,180 --> 00:20:46,120
Again...

293
00:21:03,700 --> 00:21:06,680
Yummy, yummy...

294
00:21:07,820 --> 00:21:09,280
Yummy...

295
00:21:15,720 --> 00:21:22,320
*Paper crane symbolizes hope and unconditional love

296
00:21:15,720 --> 00:21:22,320
The taste of wishes...the taste of wishes...*

297
00:21:24,800 --> 00:21:28,220
The red one tastes the best

298
00:21:28,220 --> 00:21:30,220
The red one tastes good

299
00:21:30,220 --> 00:21:32,360
The red one tastes the best

300
00:21:33,000 --> 00:21:35,840
The red one tastes the best

301
00:21:36,060 --> 00:21:38,980
The red one tastes the best...

302
00:21:43,060 --> 00:21:46,380
The blue one tastes spicy

303
00:21:47,320 --> 00:21:51,160
The red one tastes good

304
00:21:57,240 --> 00:22:01,020
The taste of wishes...the taste of wishes...

305
00:22:02,660 --> 00:22:05,040
The blue one tastes spicy

306
00:22:13,300 --> 00:22:14,740
The red one tastes the best

307
00:22:21,140 --> 00:22:23,540
What's wrong with him

308
00:22:23,540 --> 00:22:26,400
No wonder why he wore that makeup previously

309
00:22:26,400 --> 00:22:30,370
Yeah, you're right, because he need to wear another makeup anyway

310
00:22:30,370 --> 00:22:35,780
It finally ended, please count the money

311
00:22:35,780 --> 00:22:38,320
Quite a lot! Quite a lot!

312
00:22:38,320 --> 00:22:41,140
Good work

313
00:22:44,920 --> 00:22:48,740
So it adds up to 52000 yen

314
00:22:48,740 --> 00:22:54,220
That's high! Just below Bob Sap

315
00:22:54,220 --> 00:22:58,500
So the next thing, is to let Ken-chan take the Shinkansen as soon as possible

316
00:22:58,500 --> 00:23:00,500
Ken-san, thank you very much

317
00:23:01,220 --> 00:23:03,480
Hama-chan, Ma-chan, long time no see

318
00:23:03,790 --> 00:23:05,810
Ken-chan, I heard that you joined the R-1 contest?

319
00:23:05,810 --> 00:23:08,660
But I lost during the second round

320
00:23:08,660 --> 00:23:11,830
Did you perform that gag just now?

321
00:23:11,830 --> 00:23:12,670
Ken-chan powder?

322
00:23:12,670 --> 00:23:13,470
Ken-chan powder

323
00:23:13,460 --> 00:23:15,460
I did the King Kong Kang Ken-chan gag instead

324
00:23:15,460 --> 00:23:18,640
Don't think everyone else knows about it

325
00:23:19,840 --> 00:23:21,720
King Kong Kang Ken-chan

326
00:23:21,720 --> 00:23:22,120
That's it

327
00:23:22,120 --> 00:23:22,750
Who cares

328
00:23:25,460 --> 00:23:28,000
What does this black side means?

329
00:23:28,000 --> 00:23:32,420
Just briefly explain to us, if this side faces up...

330
00:23:33,640 --> 00:23:35,860
Leather

331
00:23:38,320 --> 00:23:40,300
Ken-chan, what is this jacket made of?

332
00:23:40,540 --> 00:23:42,640
Well...I don't know...I borrowed it from someone...

333
00:23:45,180 --> 00:23:48,620
You should definitely say "Leather" here, Ken-san
