1
00:00:01,770 --> 00:00:03,100
It's year 2011

2
00:00:03,400 --> 00:00:05,570
With an unusual determination in his heart

3
00:00:05,560 --> 00:00:08,790
There was a man who started the new year with an unshakable determination

4
00:00:10,200 --> 00:00:11,300
Good evening everyone

5
00:00:11,730 --> 00:00:12,700
It's Yamasaki Hosei

6
00:00:13,400 --> 00:00:15,000
Today, as a matter of fact

7
00:00:15,200 --> 00:00:20,600
I'm going to show you that I have

8
00:00:21,400 --> 00:00:23,300
an exquisite sense of tsukkomi humour

9
00:00:23,300 --> 00:00:24,100
Actually

10
00:00:24,170 --> 00:00:27,590
When I debuted as a duo, I did tsukkomi

11
00:00:28,330 --> 00:00:31,830
To be fair, I'm not now as good in tsukkomi, as I was before

12
00:00:32,200 --> 00:00:32,980
(Director Komurasaki - nickname Kom)
Komu

13
00:00:33,000 --> 00:00:33,330
(Director Komurasaki - nickname Kom)

14
00:00:33,330 --> 00:00:34,130
Yes
(Director Komurasaki - nickname Kom)

15
00:00:34,130 --> 00:00:34,330
(Director Komurasaki - nickname Kom)

16
00:00:34,330 --> 00:00:35,000
Yes
(Director Komurasaki - nickname Kom)

17
00:00:35,000 --> 00:00:35,270
Yes

18
00:00:35,330 --> 00:00:37,230
When I'll be doing it

19
00:00:37,330 --> 00:00:38,130
Yes

20
00:00:38,130 --> 00:00:39,230
I'll be counting on your help

21
00:00:40,700 --> 00:00:41,500
Right now

22
00:00:41,930 --> 00:00:45,600
The main Gaki cast

23
00:00:46,100 --> 00:00:47,500
are already inside

24
00:00:48,600 --> 00:00:49,970
I told them to do

25
00:00:50,130 --> 00:00:51,570
any kind of boke set up

26
00:00:53,570 --> 00:00:55,160
I don't know what kind it will be

27
00:00:55,170 --> 00:00:56,600
But someone

28
00:00:57,630 --> 00:01:00,560
out of these four, I donreeli know who will do it

29
00:01:03,070 --> 00:01:05,800
This year was positioned as the first year of the Tsukkomi

30
00:01:05,970 --> 00:01:07,830
A man with 24 years of experience in the arts.

31
00:01:08,870 --> 00:01:10,870
Using his own extraordinary sense of style

32
00:01:11,300 --> 00:01:12,830
From the phrases that he unfolds

33
00:01:13,000 --> 00:01:14,300
To his timing of them

34
00:01:14,770 --> 00:01:17,230
He will demonstrate high quality tsukkomi

35
00:01:18,600 --> 00:01:19,400
Let's go?

36
00:01:20,070 --> 00:01:20,970
Let's go inside

37
00:01:33,600 --> 00:01:34,500
Let's go inside

38
00:01:35,500 --> 00:01:37,970
The other four were waiting for him

39
00:01:41,330 --> 00:01:43,630
For the first time we are going to witness

40
00:01:44,070 --> 00:01:45,870
exceptional quality boke and tsukkomi!

41
00:01:48,000 --> 00:01:50,400
Greetings everyone!

42
00:01:50,870 --> 00:01:51,970
Good day

43
00:01:55,670 --> 00:01:56,870
Right away, Hamada

44
00:01:57,100 --> 00:01:59,000
Performs a boke with his pigtails

45
00:02:00,130 --> 00:02:03,860
When and what kind of tsukkomi phrase will Yamasaki unfold?

46
00:02:06,730 --> 00:02:08,030
It's quite warm in here

47
00:02:08,230 --> 00:02:09,070
It's warm, isn't it?

48
00:02:09,570 --> 00:02:11,930
Yes, but outside it's quite cold

49
00:02:12,030 --> 00:02:13,300
Indeed, on the outside

50
00:02:13,900 --> 00:02:15,370
Wellm how shall I put it

51
00:02:15,570 --> 00:02:18,160
When I came suddenly inside, it felt really warm

52
00:02:20,560 --> 00:02:21,570
You're right

53
00:02:22,000 --> 00:02:24,000
It's like a body sensation

54
00:02:24,800 --> 00:02:25,800
What did you order?

55
00:02:25,800 --> 00:02:27,200
Hot coffee

56
00:02:27,200 --> 00:02:29,600
Hot coffee? And Endo?

57
00:02:29,600 --> 00:02:30,580
Ice tea

58
00:02:31,060 --> 00:02:32,870
And what about Hamada san?

59
00:02:35,460 --> 00:02:36,660
What is this?

60
00:02:37,900 --> 00:02:38,870
Ice oolong

61
00:02:41,100 --> 00:02:41,970
I see

62
00:02:42,570 --> 00:02:44,160
Well, I'll order something as well

63
00:02:44,370 --> 00:02:45,900
Excuse me?

64
00:02:47,800 --> 00:02:49,690
Please, this is our drink menu list

65
00:02:49,830 --> 00:02:50,630
Something hot

66
00:02:51,270 --> 00:02:52,630
Can I please have oolong tea?

67
00:02:52,630 --> 00:02:53,600
Thank you very much

68
00:03:05,830 --> 00:03:06,830
It's so elaborate...

69
00:03:08,030 --> 00:03:08,830
From the cold

70
00:03:09,230 --> 00:03:10,830
Your back can get stiff

71
00:03:10,930 --> 00:03:11,970
Don't they?

72
00:03:12,600 --> 00:03:15,660
Sorry for your waiting, here's your hot tea

73
00:03:18,900 --> 00:03:19,900
Please

74
00:03:21,930 --> 00:03:23,830
I wondered if they'd give me a pot...

75
00:03:25,970 --> 00:03:27,640
WHY DO YOU HAVE PIGTAILS!?

76
00:03:42,900 --> 00:03:51,970
"High quality tsukkomi explosion"

77
00:03:59,000 --> 00:04:00,070
How did I do?

78
00:04:04,700 --> 00:04:07,300
Honestly, a lot of tsukkomi ideas come to mind

79
00:04:08,830 --> 00:04:09,630
Right?

80
00:04:10,830 --> 00:04:13,170
I thought, is it always like this!?

81
00:04:14,930 --> 00:04:19,730
The thing is, my level of boke and tsukkomi do not match at all

82
00:04:19,730 --> 00:04:21,030
And it's so painful

83
00:04:22,170 --> 00:04:23,870
I don't understand it at all...

84
00:04:24,230 --> 00:04:25,030
The atmosphere

85
00:04:25,670 --> 00:04:27,870
I don't get the atmosphere... It's so tough!!

86
00:04:30,430 --> 00:04:32,470
Hamada san says, he has a funny face

87
00:04:32,470 --> 00:04:34,130
He's proud of it...

88
00:04:34,330 --> 00:04:36,430
I think, I'm back in form now!!

89
00:04:38,530 --> 00:04:39,430
But somehow

90
00:04:39,870 --> 00:04:40,830
I'm back in shape

91
00:04:42,230 --> 00:04:45,100
I'm still rambling about boke!!

92
00:04:45,930 --> 00:04:48,700
I think, I understand the atmosphere a bit more now

93
00:04:50,600 --> 00:04:52,470
Is he still talking?

94
00:04:52,460 --> 00:04:54,260
His commentary is still in progress

95
00:04:54,260 --> 00:04:58,030
Confidence in where he went wrong

96
00:04:58,670 --> 00:05:02,500
For a comedian who was not well liked, isn't easy to leave the dressing room!!

97
00:05:04,000 --> 00:05:06,930
It's like he's gossiping in the back

98
00:05:06,930 --> 00:05:09,670
I wonder if he'll say anything, when he returns

99
00:05:14,630 --> 00:05:17,900
Why does he use this red carpet for?

100
00:05:17,900 --> 00:05:19,400
It's very important for him

101
00:05:20,470 --> 00:05:21,670
It seems like it

102
00:05:24,570 --> 00:05:25,370
This time

103
00:05:25,700 --> 00:05:27,370
Mysterious schoolboy appears

104
00:05:29,130 --> 00:05:32,330
What quality of tsukkomi will Yamasaki demonstrate?

105
00:05:33,900 --> 00:05:36,530
...no, but I didn't go that far in the past...

106
00:05:37,230 --> 00:05:38,230
Is that so?

107
00:05:39,030 --> 00:05:40,770
A long time ago...

108
00:05:43,730 --> 00:05:44,570
Excuse me!

109
00:05:46,330 --> 00:05:47,130
Yes?

110
00:05:48,300 --> 00:05:49,100
Hot oolong please

111
00:05:49,370 --> 00:05:51,330
Yes, please wait for a moment

112
00:05:52,170 --> 00:05:53,370
You really like hot oolong?

113
00:05:53,800 --> 00:05:56,200
It was quite cold, I'm already chilled to the core

114
00:05:57,900 --> 00:05:59,170
One needs to warm up a bit...

115
00:06:02,930 --> 00:06:05,130
I wish I could go somewhere warm

116
00:06:05,170 --> 00:06:06,400
Wouldn't it be nice...

117
00:06:07,000 --> 00:06:09,260
It's a bit tough on location, this time of year

118
00:06:09,400 --> 00:06:11,470
It's quite freezing... Thank you for your order

119
00:06:11,470 --> 00:06:12,970
Here is your hot oolong tea

120
00:06:13,400 --> 00:06:14,630
Please

121
00:06:15,400 --> 00:06:16,130
Thank you

122
00:06:16,130 --> 00:06:16,930
Enjoy it

123
00:06:17,500 --> 00:06:18,670
This one will warm me up

124
00:06:18,800 --> 00:06:19,770
It's so warm

125
00:06:20,600 --> 00:06:21,630
Where did you buy it?

126
00:06:22,930 --> 00:06:23,730
This thing?

127
00:06:23,870 --> 00:06:25,800
I bought it in Shibuya

128
00:06:27,200 --> 00:06:28,500
Because it's (chest) quite open

129
00:06:28,570 --> 00:06:30,660
I wonder if you feel cold?

130
00:06:30,770 --> 00:06:32,400
That was probably an old man's idea

131
00:06:32,700 --> 00:06:36,190
Young kids are surprisingly open these days

132
00:06:37,100 --> 00:06:39,800
I definitely wouldn't be able to... You'd be quite cold?

133
00:06:39,800 --> 00:06:42,530
If I'll open it completely...

134
00:06:43,770 --> 00:06:46,590
WHAT IS THIS SCHOOLBOY DOING HERE!?

135
00:07:12,630 --> 00:07:16,360
That's the first time I made a joke and Hamada san became surprised

136
00:07:17,270 --> 00:07:22,990
I didn't think I'd be that good, but this time I did great

137
00:07:24,100 --> 00:07:25,430
I did the timing right

138
00:07:25,730 --> 00:07:27,130
And then the choice of words!!

139
00:07:29,200 --> 00:07:37,300
There were various tsukkomi ideas circulating in my head

140
00:07:37,970 --> 00:07:40,070
That was such a bland tsukkomi

141
00:07:41,200 --> 00:07:44,400
He just asked what is this student doing here

142
00:07:46,400 --> 00:07:49,600
It's not just normal, but the choice is strange

143
00:07:49,970 --> 00:07:51,890
Are they still saying they're going to do it?

144
00:07:52,470 --> 00:07:53,270
Do they?

145
00:07:55,260 --> 00:07:56,360
Well, if that's the case

146
00:07:56,830 --> 00:07:58,060
I'll keep up with them

147
00:08:04,370 --> 00:08:06,000
If he'll order that tea again we can guess

148
00:08:06,030 --> 00:08:07,290
That it's part of his tsukkomi

149
00:08:08,230 --> 00:08:09,030
That's right...

150
00:08:09,670 --> 00:08:10,930
Somehow...

151
00:08:12,300 --> 00:08:13,530
Alright, alright

152
00:08:16,430 --> 00:08:19,590
Endo provokes with a challenging boke (Kiyoshiro Imawano)

153
00:08:20,370 --> 00:08:21,530
However, will Yamazaki

154
00:08:21,900 --> 00:08:23,230
complement this boke

155
00:08:23,630 --> 00:08:25,170
with his sharp tsukkomi!?

156
00:08:29,470 --> 00:08:30,670
Oh, my back...

157
00:08:36,370 --> 00:08:37,890
Do you know if a typhoon

158
00:08:38,400 --> 00:08:39,770
will or won't come?

159
00:08:41,070 --> 00:08:41,870
At this time?

160
00:08:43,270 --> 00:08:44,900
That's unusual, this time of year

161
00:08:44,900 --> 00:08:46,260
I thought there's going to be one

162
00:08:46,270 --> 00:08:48,990
I don't think there are any at this time of year

163
00:08:54,270 --> 00:08:56,260
Can I have something cold?

164
00:08:56,270 --> 00:08:57,070
Excuse me?

165
00:08:58,330 --> 00:08:59,130
Yes

166
00:08:59,270 --> 00:09:01,130
Can I have something properly cold!!

167
00:09:02,500 --> 00:09:03,900
I'll go, have a pee real quickly

168
00:09:04,000 --> 00:09:05,660
If you excuse me

169
00:09:05,930 --> 00:09:06,770
I understand

170
00:09:07,000 --> 00:09:09,600
He's causing so much trouble

171
00:09:10,070 --> 00:09:11,800
Can't he just stick with oolong?

172
00:09:11,800 --> 00:09:12,600
That's right

173
00:09:13,830 --> 00:09:15,430
What's up with him?

174
00:09:16,870 --> 00:09:18,730
Yamasaki rests in the toilet

175
00:09:19,270 --> 00:09:20,730
To complement Endo's boke

176
00:09:21,100 --> 00:09:22,900
we'll give some freedom to Yamasaki

177
00:09:25,630 --> 00:09:27,170
So, they did it like that

178
00:09:28,830 --> 00:09:35,090
I'm talking about memories from when I was in secondary school

179
00:09:36,200 --> 00:09:38,070
That's rough

180
00:09:38,130 --> 00:09:40,300
Again, they went with such rough boke

181
00:09:40,370 --> 00:09:47,100
It brings back memories of my secondary school days

182
00:09:48,600 --> 00:09:51,720
I've been through a lot, you know, I've been in clubs and stuff

183
00:09:52,430 --> 00:09:55,700
It's a great distraction to remember all those things

184
00:09:57,230 --> 00:09:58,730
Well, I'll manage somehow

185
00:09:59,000 --> 00:10:01,300
'cause I've managed to do it so far

186
00:10:02,670 --> 00:10:04,960
It's not even tsukkomi any more

187
00:10:06,270 --> 00:10:08,670
He's more like skidding in place

188
00:10:08,930 --> 00:10:13,000
Of course typhoon would never come here now!!

189
00:10:13,170 --> 00:10:15,130
And his back is absolutely fine!!

190
00:10:15,330 --> 00:10:18,500
Each time he does it like that. In a lame way

191
00:10:19,270 --> 00:10:21,330
He's panicking right now

192
00:10:21,830 --> 00:10:24,590
His options are getting narrower and narrower

193
00:10:25,500 --> 00:10:28,600
When he looked through the scope of his options this size

194
00:10:28,600 --> 00:10:30,890
His panic spread fast

195
00:10:31,470 --> 00:10:33,300
That's as much as he could see

196
00:10:34,770 --> 00:10:36,000
Alright, let's do it!

197
00:10:39,670 --> 00:10:40,930
What was he doing?

198
00:10:42,400 --> 00:10:43,300
Thank you for waiting

199
00:10:43,700 --> 00:10:44,500
What's that?

200
00:10:45,700 --> 00:10:46,500
Oolong tea?

201
00:10:46,970 --> 00:10:48,670
I might be too sweet, though

202
00:10:49,330 --> 00:10:50,130
Speaking frankly...

203
00:10:52,470 --> 00:10:53,270
But you know

204
00:10:53,470 --> 00:10:55,760
That's your usual cold oolong tea

205
00:10:56,500 --> 00:10:57,170
But you know

206
00:10:57,160 --> 00:10:59,230
What's that thing that oolong tea has?

207
00:10:59,230 --> 00:11:03,190
There's an ingredient like that, that kind of thing

208
00:11:05,600 --> 00:11:09,900
I can't help much with such descriptions "like that" or "ahh that one"

209
00:11:10,200 --> 00:11:11,000
You're right

210
00:11:11,100 --> 00:11:11,900
That's true

211
00:11:13,000 --> 00:11:13,830
My body...

212
00:11:21,370 --> 00:11:22,990
How many times did he mention it?

213
00:11:27,000 --> 00:11:29,000
"5 minutes later"

214
00:11:30,830 --> 00:11:32,430
What kind of place do you go to and

215
00:11:33,530 --> 00:11:37,500
how long does it usually take everyone to get a haircut?

216
00:11:37,500 --> 00:11:38,500
A haircut?

217
00:11:39,800 --> 00:11:43,400
I just do this myself in the bathroom once a week

218
00:11:43,770 --> 00:11:44,970
That sounds great

219
00:11:45,500 --> 00:11:46,470
But that's

220
00:11:46,600 --> 00:11:47,400
Well, well

221
00:11:47,800 --> 00:11:49,400
I wonder if it's really that great

222
00:11:52,300 --> 00:11:54,700
I thought you were going to ask everyone?

223
00:11:58,300 --> 00:11:59,370
Why don't we have a meal?

224
00:12:01,500 --> 00:12:03,560
Why don't we order some?

225
00:12:03,570 --> 00:12:05,470
Let's try different meals

226
00:12:05,730 --> 00:12:07,700
I'll order some

227
00:12:08,070 --> 00:12:09,500
Excuse us

228
00:12:11,130 --> 00:12:12,800
There's so much alcohol in the menu

229
00:12:13,200 --> 00:12:14,330
Can I make an order?

230
00:12:14,800 --> 00:12:15,600
Go ahead

231
00:12:17,570 --> 00:12:18,370
Then, can I have

232
00:12:19,130 --> 00:12:19,930
Chow mein...

233
00:12:20,170 --> 00:12:20,970
What's that?

234
00:12:21,470 --> 00:12:22,270
Chow mein style

235
00:12:22,430 --> 00:12:23,270
fried soba

236
00:12:23,570 --> 00:12:25,330
1200, wait 1250

237
00:12:25,570 --> 00:12:27,000
Why are you from "Bad Rouge Magic"?

238
00:12:28,970 --> 00:12:30,330
Why are you from "Bad Rouge Magic"?

239
00:12:54,200 --> 00:12:56,030
Enso's effort was worthless

240
00:12:56,300 --> 00:12:56,930
That was so bad

241
00:12:56,930 --> 00:12:59,030
That was so badly done

242
00:12:59,030 --> 00:13:01,300
That was so terrible. What did want to say?

243
00:13:02,300 --> 00:13:03,100
Chu?

244
00:13:03,260 --> 00:13:04,770
He said Chu

245
00:13:11,130 --> 00:13:13,680
I have no trust anymore in you, Kom

246
00:13:17,130 --> 00:13:21,660
Why can't I have a "Rouge Magic" memory of me in junior high school?

247
00:13:23,570 --> 00:13:29,500
Because I remember when I was in junior high school, that used to be a funny gag

248
00:13:30,330 --> 00:13:31,860
Well, you've said it clear

249
00:13:31,870 --> 00:13:32,970
I did not!

250
00:13:33,870 --> 00:13:37,240
Just as I was about to do it, I just sucked in my breath...

251
00:13:37,500 --> 00:13:38,300
I'm sorry

252
00:13:41,630 --> 00:13:42,530
Give me more time

253
00:13:42,730 --> 00:13:44,570
I will definitely do it

254
00:13:44,560 --> 00:13:45,530
I understand

255
00:13:57,130 --> 00:13:57,930
You know...

256
00:13:58,870 --> 00:14:02,300
The sun is setting fast

257
00:14:04,130 --> 00:14:06,390
I thought it was getting late

258
00:14:06,390 --> 00:14:09,000
Around the end of the year, it's even earlier. Around 5:30

259
00:14:09,000 --> 00:14:10,570
So fast

260
00:14:11,400 --> 00:14:12,300
Here's your order

261
00:14:12,600 --> 00:14:15,730
Why don't we have some food?

262
00:14:17,130 --> 00:14:18,630
Here's your spaghetti

263
00:14:18,730 --> 00:14:20,230
That looks delicious

264
00:14:24,330 --> 00:14:27,730
Here's your Indian sweet and sour pork

265
00:14:30,870 --> 00:14:34,030
Boke with Indian sweet and sour pork

266
00:14:35,130 --> 00:14:39,530
Will Yamasaki be able to perform a precise boke?

267
00:14:43,500 --> 00:14:44,300
Looks delicious

268
00:14:46,530 --> 00:14:47,400
Looks great

269
00:14:51,230 --> 00:14:53,330
With what emotions shall I eat it?

270
00:14:53,470 --> 00:14:55,020
Why is it stuffed with feathers?

271
00:14:55,470 --> 00:14:57,090
What kind of dish is it?

272
00:14:57,330 --> 00:14:58,860
I don't understand

273
00:15:24,970 --> 00:15:26,830
That was a disaster

274
00:15:27,500 --> 00:15:28,730
I was looking so much forward

275
00:15:28,830 --> 00:15:30,300
For him to say something

276
00:15:30,500 --> 00:15:31,330
That's true

277
00:15:33,400 --> 00:15:36,230
"What kind of dish is it?" He asked it, right?

278
00:15:39,300 --> 00:15:43,000
Because of his earlier mistakes. Kom waited for too long

279
00:15:43,830 --> 00:15:44,570
That's right

280
00:15:44,570 --> 00:15:45,700
That's quite troublesome

281
00:15:46,970 --> 00:15:48,100
This time I'm a bit...

282
00:15:49,400 --> 00:15:53,510
I disbelief grew even more in Kom, but

283
00:15:53,730 --> 00:15:56,430
I think, somehow now, I am in shape!!

284
00:15:56,730 --> 00:15:58,100
Finally, I'm saved...

285
00:15:59,870 --> 00:16:01,860
Finally, I'm saved? What does he mean?

286
00:16:03,570 --> 00:16:05,000
When I'm doing it

287
00:16:05,270 --> 00:16:07,000
During that moment, all my boke gags

288
00:16:08,500 --> 00:16:09,430
mix up

289
00:16:10,270 --> 00:16:11,570
I had to deal with lychee

290
00:16:12,030 --> 00:16:13,770
which had a lot of feathers

291
00:16:15,770 --> 00:16:16,770
Lychee?

292
00:16:17,830 --> 00:16:18,970
Is there a lychee?

293
00:16:20,000 --> 00:16:21,800
It doesn't have any!

294
00:16:22,500 --> 00:16:23,300
Well, that's

295
00:16:23,500 --> 00:16:27,230
quite simple, he's just presbyopic

296
00:16:28,030 --> 00:16:32,500
He saw meatballs as lychee!

297
00:16:33,100 --> 00:16:34,470
He did it indeed

298
00:16:34,700 --> 00:16:36,070
That's right

299
00:16:36,200 --> 00:16:37,200
What was that?

300
00:16:38,330 --> 00:16:42,800
I had no luck with that thing!!

301
00:16:47,300 --> 00:16:49,730
The rest got ready with new boke prop

302
00:16:50,730 --> 00:16:52,260
That should be easy to understand

303
00:16:52,270 --> 00:16:55,690
Lobster tails from Matsumoto's nostrils

304
00:16:55,730 --> 00:17:00,810
Can he do it as soon, as he gets here?

305
00:17:01,370 --> 00:17:04,760
All the time, once he sees us, he already grins

306
00:17:04,770 --> 00:17:05,570
Is that so?

307
00:17:06,360 --> 00:17:10,260
And then he does it like that

308
00:17:10,500 --> 00:17:16,130
He's been pretending to be unwell for too long!

309
00:17:16,170 --> 00:17:19,100
"I'm not feeling well" "My body hurts"

310
00:17:20,300 --> 00:17:21,800
For this boke when and

311
00:17:22,230 --> 00:17:24,600
what kind of tsukkomi will Yamasaki perform?

312
00:17:49,600 --> 00:17:51,200
I feel a lot better

313
00:17:51,400 --> 00:17:52,200
What's that?

314
00:17:52,430 --> 00:17:53,230
You see...

315
00:17:54,400 --> 00:17:56,440
I don't know if I twisted it around here

316
00:17:58,470 --> 00:17:59,370
Over here

317
00:18:00,130 --> 00:18:03,000
Perhaps, you've sprained your neck?

318
00:18:03,000 --> 00:18:04,650
YOU CAN'T DRINK IT!!

319
00:18:04,900 --> 00:18:06,470
BEACUSE YOU'RE CROSSED OUT!!

320
00:18:06,470 --> 00:18:09,020
I DON'T KNOW WHAT AM I SUPPOSED TO THINK!!

321
00:18:09,070 --> 00:18:11,920
WHAT'S GOING ON???

322
00:18:40,230 --> 00:18:41,230
It's finally over

323
00:18:43,300 --> 00:18:44,100
He's hopeless!

324
00:18:46,430 --> 00:18:48,860
What the hell did he do?

325
00:18:48,930 --> 00:18:55,730
I wondered what's wrong with him, and now it's clear that he's simply bad at it!

326
00:18:58,130 --> 00:19:00,170
They laugh, they laugh!

327
00:19:00,870 --> 00:19:02,330
They laugh so much!!

328
00:19:03,230 --> 00:19:05,230
I think I get it now

329
00:19:06,670 --> 00:19:10,530
I wonder, if that's my hot instict?

330
00:19:10,530 --> 00:19:11,330
You're right

331
00:19:11,670 --> 00:19:13,170
Although, the timing

332
00:19:13,970 --> 00:19:15,200
had no role here...

333
00:19:15,600 --> 00:19:16,470
I think

334
00:19:16,630 --> 00:19:17,870
it came before my mouth

335
00:19:18,500 --> 00:19:19,300
Before? I see

336
00:19:20,930 --> 00:19:21,730
I'll go with that!!

337
00:19:30,030 --> 00:19:31,600
But January...

338
00:19:32,300 --> 00:19:33,300
or February...

339
00:19:33,830 --> 00:19:35,800
February came too fast...

340
00:19:37,570 --> 00:19:40,600
Tanaka goes full force with double boke

341
00:19:42,230 --> 00:19:43,770
Will Yamasaki face this boke

342
00:19:44,270 --> 00:19:46,300
with a 100% tsukkomi?

343
00:19:49,970 --> 00:19:51,270
That was fast...

344
00:20:11,600 --> 00:20:15,000
It's so dry right now

345
00:20:15,000 --> 00:20:17,500
I usually heat up the water to 30 degrees

346
00:20:17,600 --> 00:20:19,670
To 30 degrees?

347
00:20:19,830 --> 00:20:21,700
Me as well, after a rough day

348
00:20:22,170 --> 00:20:25,730
I'd open the bathroom door and leave the shower on for a bit

349
00:20:27,100 --> 00:20:28,300
For around 5 to 10 minutes

350
00:20:28,300 --> 00:20:29,830
So, you dry up like that?

351
00:20:30,230 --> 00:20:31,690
ARE YOU SURPRISED!?

352
00:20:32,070 --> 00:20:32,970
FOR SOME TIME

353
00:20:33,630 --> 00:20:35,000
YOU'RE EYES ARE POPPING OUT!!

354
00:20:35,800 --> 00:20:37,770
AND YOUR TONGUE IS STICKING OUT

355
00:20:38,600 --> 00:20:40,800
WHAT'S THE MEANING OF IT?

356
00:20:40,900 --> 00:20:44,470
YOU SCARED THE SHIT OUT OF ME!!

357
00:20:49,970 --> 00:20:50,990
That's just horrible

358
00:20:54,270 --> 00:20:55,370
He's hopeless

359
00:20:58,600 --> 00:20:59,630
That was shit

360
00:21:00,900 --> 00:21:01,700
That's shit

361
00:21:04,430 --> 00:21:06,000
Just leave the industry already

362
00:21:07,770 --> 00:21:08,570
Hey!

363
00:21:10,470 --> 00:21:12,690
Tanaka, you completely destroyed him!

364
00:21:13,030 --> 00:21:15,290
I've put a lot of effort into this!

365
00:21:16,470 --> 00:21:17,270
How was I?

366
00:21:18,630 --> 00:21:19,700
I liked it a lot!

367
00:21:20,600 --> 00:21:23,880
Because I pulled the gag, that Tanaka would look funny

368
00:21:24,200 --> 00:21:25,000
When I did it

369
00:21:25,570 --> 00:21:27,830
Tanaka can barely stand up after that!

370
00:21:28,400 --> 00:21:32,800
You're probably Japan's first man with eyes and tongue popping out of his head!

371
00:21:32,800 --> 00:21:33,600
Isn't it right?

372
00:21:33,770 --> 00:21:35,200
You've challenged others now

373
00:21:35,900 --> 00:21:40,900
Because you did it for the first time, I want it to be established

374
00:21:41,100 --> 00:21:43,000
He did so shit!!

375
00:21:43,670 --> 00:21:45,930
That was so shit...

376
00:21:47,700 --> 00:21:49,430
That went really bad

377
00:21:49,460 --> 00:21:53,210
Even NSC (Yoshimoto New Star Creation) newcomers will say that he's shit!

378
00:22:10,400 --> 00:22:13,860
This time the mysterious schoolboy is at an extraordinary setting

379
00:22:15,530 --> 00:22:17,100
How will Yamasaki

380
00:22:17,770 --> 00:22:19,100
handle this boke?

381
00:22:28,000 --> 00:22:29,570
It's already February

382
00:22:30,370 --> 00:22:32,070
I have a Birthday

383
00:22:33,130 --> 00:22:34,500
You have a Birthday, right?

384
00:22:36,200 --> 00:22:38,430
I'm done with my medication

385
00:22:38,870 --> 00:22:40,400
I'm done with it

386
00:22:43,730 --> 00:22:44,530
And you know...

387
00:22:45,200 --> 00:22:46,370
I'm very happy

388
00:22:46,700 --> 00:22:49,170
When this Birthday will come...

389
00:22:49,230 --> 00:22:50,530
I WON'T BE HAPPY ANYMORE!!

390
00:22:51,070 --> 00:22:53,000
DID SOMEONE DIE?

391
00:22:53,400 --> 00:22:54,730
IT MAKES ME FEEL SAD

392
00:22:55,130 --> 00:22:57,400
WHY, WHY DID YOU BRING IT HERE?

393
00:22:57,930 --> 00:23:00,040
TELL ME!!

394
00:23:01,130 --> 00:23:01,930
OH, FINE

395
00:23:04,200 --> 00:23:05,000
OH, FINE

396
00:23:27,600 --> 00:23:28,800
That was a forced finish

397
00:23:32,130 --> 00:23:33,600
What do you think, TV viewers?

398
00:23:33,800 --> 00:23:36,190
If you have anything to write with you

399
00:23:36,430 --> 00:23:37,790
I'd like you to write a few words

400
00:23:38,030 --> 00:23:41,590
Please write Yamasaki = shit performer

401
00:23:43,800 --> 00:23:44,990
If you can get it written

402
00:23:55,900 --> 00:23:58,790
We're sorry that you had to go along with some weird stuff

403
00:23:59,430 --> 00:24:01,300
Don't ever be like that guy!
