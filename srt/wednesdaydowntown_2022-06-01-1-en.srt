00:00:02,920 --> 00:00:06,700
Welcome to Wednesday Downtown

2
00:00:06,700 --> 00:00:10,760
Let’s get on with our first presenter please

3
00:00:16,640 --> 00:00:19,560
It's Savannah's Takahashi!

4
00:00:19,560 --> 00:00:22,710
Savannah!
-It's not Savannah's combo debut

5
00:00:22,710 --> 00:00:26,900
Yagi's been completely abandoned
-No no no

6
00:00:26,900 --> 00:00:30,250
It's just me this time

7
00:00:30,250 --> 00:00:35,220
So, today is a special episode

8
00:00:35,220 --> 00:00:36,850
Today is just one project

9
00:00:36,850 --> 00:00:39,690
First of all, please read this

10
00:00:40,920 --> 00:00:45,130
Have you heard of K. Kazumi...?

11
00:00:45,130 --> 00:00:46,800
K. Kazumi…

12
00:00:47,680 --> 00:00:52,200
A huge body that is even taller than a vending machine

13
00:00:50,900 --> 00:00:52,200
That big?

14
00:00:53,500 --> 00:00:57,740
Compared to April of this year, I've grown 1cm taller.

15
00:00:53,500 --> 00:00:57,740
Height at that time was 213.3cm

16
00:00:54,050 --> 00:00:57,740
Height 2m and 13cm

17
00:00:56,790 --> 00:00:57,740
At the time?

18
00:00:58,450 --> 00:01:01,450
Weight 222kg

19
00:01:01,290 --> 00:01:02,270
Weight is increasing

20
00:01:01,450 --> 00:01:06,120
Now wearing 33.5cm

21
00:01:02,270 --> 00:01:05,620
The size of the foot is 33.5cm

22
00:01:06,520 --> 00:01:16,020
These images were posted online by an unidentified woman who calls herself K. Kazumi

23
00:01:17,250 --> 00:01:20,900
However, her physique is not the only surprising thing

24
00:01:21,580 --> 00:01:24,300
She also has the ability to squeeze a frying pan flat

25
00:01:24,640 --> 00:01:28,040
And the strength to rip a pack of playing cards

26
00:01:28,040 --> 00:01:32,840
I eat nine meals a day

27
00:01:28,770 --> 00:01:32,000
The size of her intake is also shocking

28
00:01:33,240 --> 00:01:40,530
Compared to an appetite king artist, she achieved an overwhelming record with 3.5 times the amount of food

29
00:01:42,010 --> 00:01:48,290
But this K. Kazumi has not yet appeared in media

30
00:01:49,000 --> 00:01:54,200
And has been on just Yahoo for over a decade

31
00:01:55,560 --> 00:02:03,740
At some point, she became known as an urban legend woman in a small area

32
00:02:04,240 --> 00:02:10,150
In Musashi Kosugi, there is a woman who is about the same size as K. Kazumi

33
00:02:09,200 --> 00:02:10,860
There is also eyewitness information

34
00:02:10,150 --> 00:02:14,020
In the convenience store there was a woman about 2 meters tall and weighing about 160 kg

35
00:02:14,600 --> 00:02:17,740
Could it be K. Kazumi?

36
00:02:17,740 --> 00:02:21,960
Despite a lot of eyewitness information

37
00:02:22,190 --> 00:02:29,430
I think this monster is just made up

38
00:02:22,190 --> 00:02:29,430
Occasionally some people believe it

39
00:02:22,190 --> 00:02:29,430
Seems unlikely

40
00:02:22,530 --> 00:02:29,320
There is also the view that this might just be an urban legend

41
00:02:30,070 --> 00:02:35,210
In recent years, there has been a heated debate between the "existence and non-existence" factions

42
00:02:35,620 --> 00:02:40,480
But tonight, the controversy over this K. Kazumi will come to an end

43
00:02:38,690 --> 00:02:39,560
Really?

44
00:02:40,480 --> 00:02:44,310
Can the human body really eat that much in one meal? It's incredible

45
00:02:44,310 --> 00:02:49,590
If its actually possible, I think they could win the Olympic gold medal in weightlifting

46
00:02:50,100 --> 00:02:58,660
After half a year of investigation and tracking, we are finally able to reveal the true identity of the legendary K. Kazumi

47
00:02:59,900 --> 00:03:02,970
K. Kazumi-san will be on set soon.
-Then let's shoot

48
00:03:05,480 --> 00:03:09,140
K. Kazumi's real face is...?

49
00:03:12,240 --> 00:03:14,630
Have you heard of such a person?

50
00:03:14,630 --> 00:03:16,120
Nope
- Me neither

51
00:03:16,120 --> 00:03:18,680
I've never heard of them at all
- I know a little bit about it

52
00:03:18,680 --> 00:03:22,320
You've heard?
-It's a frequent topic of discussion on websites

53
00:03:22,320 --> 00:03:28,460
So, tonight is the hour of K. Kazumi's reveal

54
00:03:28,460 --> 00:03:30,660
You're gonna put an end to it, right?

55
00:03:30,660 --> 00:03:32,500
This is it

56
00:03:32,500 --> 00:03:34,530
Whether they exist or not
-Yes, this is the debate

57
00:03:34,530 --> 00:03:38,700
First of all, please take a look at this VTR

58
00:03:40,280 --> 00:03:44,270
The body type is rumored to be 2m 13cm

59
00:03:44,270 --> 00:03:45,690
Super big

60
00:03:45,690 --> 00:03:47,580
Weight 222kg

61
00:03:47,580 --> 00:03:49,910
Who took this photo?
-Yeah

62
00:03:49,910 --> 00:03:55,290
This is supposedly the only photo that exists of this person

63
00:03:55,290 --> 00:03:57,450
Uploaded themselves?

64
00:03:57,450 --> 00:04:03,360
To prevent other people of enormous size from being called K. Kazumi in the street

65
00:04:03,360 --> 00:04:05,460
They shared this photo so there's a distinction

66
00:04:05,460 --> 00:04:06,510
I see

67
00:04:07,330 --> 00:04:09,010
Although uploaded

68
00:04:09,430 --> 00:04:14,340
In order not to be recognized, they used a mosaic

69
00:04:14,340 --> 00:04:17,240
Kaz knows this person, right? Heard anything about her?

70
00:04:17,570 --> 00:04:20,980
It's quite famous on SNS and makes waves every once in a while

71
00:04:21,410 --> 00:04:26,280
Questions will also sometimes be answered on Yahoo

72
00:04:26,280 --> 00:04:31,220
So, do you think this K. Kazumi exists?

73
00:04:31,420 --> 00:04:38,650
If you're doing this then... I guess so?

74
00:04:38,650 --> 00:04:42,700
So, let's put this to rest today

75
00:04:42,700 --> 00:04:46,140
First of all, let's go over K. Kazumi's huge size and strange power

76
00:04:46,140 --> 00:04:51,510
Please take a look

77
00:04:52,540 --> 00:04:55,640
The Legend of K. Kazumi

78
00:04:56,400 --> 00:05:01,270
At this point, as all we have to go on

79
00:05:01,270 --> 00:05:03,990
Is the Yahoo account

80
00:05:05,040 --> 00:05:09,030
Introducing their amazing body

81
00:05:09,870 --> 00:05:15,830
As the account claims she resembles Nankai Candy's Shizu-chan

82
00:05:16,460 --> 00:05:21,640
We asked Shizu-chan to do the voiceover for K. Kazumi's speech

83
00:05:22,110 --> 00:05:23,310
Voice: Shizuyo

84
00:05:23,730 --> 00:05:32,650
K. Kazumi's three main characteristics are firstly, her huge size, which has been specified

85
00:05:33,360 --> 00:05:39,720
In 2017, she commented about changes in her height

86
00:05:40,450 --> 00:05:46,410
In senior year she was 184cm and increased in height every year after

87
00:05:43,530 --> 00:05:44,960
So tall

88
00:05:46,410 --> 00:05:50,680
Finally exceeded 2m at the age of 32

89
00:05:51,030 --> 00:05:53,310
Pregnant with your second child?
- Pregnant?

90
00:05:52,600 --> 00:05:56,430
Now, five years after the 2017 submission

91
00:05:57,020 --> 00:06:00,540
The height of K. Kazumi, 38, is

92
00:06:02,920 --> 00:06:11,990
Had my height measured at the hospital I always go to, and my height was 213.3cm

93
00:06:11,990 --> 00:06:13,320
Still growing?

94
00:06:13,010 --> 00:06:16,790
So, she grew by about 10cm

95
00:06:17,530 --> 00:06:27,660
And according to the uploaded physical examination form, her weight was 222.6kg

96
00:06:21,200 --> 00:06:25,140
The name is there, too

97
00:06:27,660 --> 00:06:30,090
Yes, the name is listed

98
00:06:30,090 --> 00:06:34,460
The weight exceeds that of this sumo wrestler

99
00:06:34,460 --> 00:06:39,500
K. Kazumi, a woman with an unconventional body type

100
00:06:39,500 --> 00:06:40,650
If this is true...

101
00:06:41,180 --> 00:06:45,860
Therefore, there are many inconveniences in her daily life

102
00:06:44,680 --> 00:06:46,880
There are occasionally such people overseas, right?

103
00:06:46,880 --> 00:06:52,450
My waist and hips and thighs are too big

104
00:06:52,450 --> 00:06:58,100
So I can't wear commercially-available products, I even have to order special underwear

105
00:06:58,100 --> 00:06:59,300
Really big

106
00:07:00,170 --> 00:07:08,880
I've cracked the toilet seat several times, and even the entire toilet bowl

107
00:07:08,880 --> 00:07:14,080
Although its embarrassing, I had to get a toilet for sumo wrestlers installed

108
00:07:14,660 --> 00:07:22,430
Most commercially available products are an unsuitable size, making for great inconvenience

109
00:07:23,980 --> 00:07:30,770
The next are K. Kazumi's superhuman characteristics

110
00:07:32,540 --> 00:07:41,380
Pulled the hoop off

111
00:07:33,170 --> 00:07:39,890
K. Kazumi is not only large but also has strength far beyond that of ordinary people

112
00:07:37,460 --> 00:07:39,890
Pulled it down...

113
00:07:40,660 --> 00:07:42,650
Is this possible?

114
00:07:42,650 --> 00:07:49,220
With a little effort, I can easily tear up a pile of 54 cards

115
00:07:45,130 --> 00:07:46,850
Is this a manga?

116
00:07:50,510 --> 00:07:53,620
Grip strength like a character in a manga

117
00:07:53,620 --> 00:07:55,830
It's like Kaoru Hanayama

118
00:07:57,010 --> 00:08:02,500
This frying pan was also flattened by me, I took a picture before and after

119
00:08:02,500 --> 00:08:03,500
Scary

120
00:08:04,380 --> 00:08:07,990
And then there is this pot lid

121
00:08:11,190 --> 00:08:12,380
Scrunched up

122
00:08:12,380 --> 00:08:15,850
It is no longer possible to see what it was before

123
00:08:16,820 --> 00:08:23,490
We sought the advice from the person with the highest wrist strength in the country

124
00:08:24,180 --> 00:08:31,160
Super heavyweight fitness competitor Taisan Shimizu

125
00:08:31,330 --> 00:08:33,600
Have you heard of K. Kazumi?

126
00:08:33,600 --> 00:08:36,630
I've seen a little picture on Twitter

127
00:08:36,630 --> 00:08:41,440
I heard that there is such a person of huge size

128
00:08:41,570 --> 00:08:44,940
About K. Kazumi, she seems to possess strange powers

129
00:08:44,940 --> 00:08:48,110
Such as being able to flatten a wok

130
00:08:48,110 --> 00:08:49,480
She's a monster!

131
00:08:49,550 --> 00:08:51,880
That's impossible. And this is a woman, right?

132
00:08:52,020 --> 00:08:56,890
Although I have seen some of the strongest women

133
00:08:57,120 --> 00:08:58,860
Such people do not exist

134
00:08:59,420 --> 00:09:07,030
If she exists, she's likely to be the world's strongest

135
00:09:08,100 --> 00:09:10,130
Its impossible

136
00:09:10,680 --> 00:09:15,600
The next VTR is

137
00:09:15,600 --> 00:09:19,530
A recreation of K. Kazumi's strange powers as detailed on Yahoo

138
00:09:23,020 --> 00:09:26,020
It was about 20 years ago

139
00:09:26,020 --> 00:09:27,160
Student days

140
00:09:27,160 --> 00:09:29,810
When K. Kazumi was a college student

141
00:09:30,950 --> 00:09:35,120
I'm looking forward to the sleepover, Kazumi

142
00:09:41,140 --> 00:09:44,390
I'm hungry.
-Didn't you just eat?

143
00:09:42,800 --> 00:09:48,040
(Yoneda2000 Love)

144
00:09:46,160 --> 00:09:47,570
Don't do that

145
00:09:48,700 --> 00:09:55,410
On this day, Kazumi came to the guy for her club activity

146
00:09:56,760 --> 00:10:02,220
After entering the sports warehouse of this arena, I found an old instrument for measuring back muscles

147
00:10:02,220 --> 00:10:08,400
The female members half-jokingly measured their back muscle strength values

148
00:10:08,400 --> 00:10:09,860
Impossible!
-It's only 50

149
00:10:09,860 --> 00:10:13,760
This is not possible
-So annoying!

150
00:10:13,760 --> 00:10:16,620
Kazumi is next.
-Forget it

151
00:10:16,620 --> 00:10:20,830
Try it.
-Okay, I'll try

152
00:10:21,500 --> 00:10:25,580
I tried my best to do it

153
00:10:42,340 --> 00:10:47,600
It's a lie, right?
-This is too much

154
00:10:47,600 --> 00:10:50,990
Damn it, it's broken, what should I do?

155
00:10:53,540 --> 00:11:00,050
The part where the chain is connected to the device started to crack

156
00:11:00,050 --> 00:11:05,690
The pointer also stopped working

157
00:11:01,060 --> 00:11:02,750
This can't be real, right?

158
00:11:10,420 --> 00:11:12,960
This is not something that humans can do, right?

159
00:11:12,960 --> 00:11:15,220
The world record is about 500kg

160
00:11:15,220 --> 00:11:18,800
If you pull off the chain, you probably already have 1t of power

161
00:11:18,900 --> 00:11:22,200
Rather than an anomaly, this is more like a monster

162
00:11:21,660 --> 00:11:24,000
Yes, I think so

163
00:11:22,900 --> 00:11:27,460
The next VTR of Kazumi's strange power is

164
00:11:28,270 --> 00:11:29,690
I'm going to the bathroom

165
00:11:31,100 --> 00:11:39,550
When I used to travel overseas, after entering a public bathroom

166
00:11:52,240 --> 00:11:53,780
No way!

167
00:11:55,000 --> 00:12:05,940
I broke the handle and couldn't open the door

168
00:11:56,060 --> 00:11:57,400
It's broken

169
00:12:23,480 --> 00:12:29,020
Because of the force, the screw broke

170
00:12:30,210 --> 00:12:39,010
The sound of the break echoed in the bathroom, which made me feel embarrassed

171
00:12:35,550 --> 00:12:38,000
It's not embarrassing, right?

172
00:12:39,560 --> 00:12:43,800
The last example of K. Kazumi's power is

173
00:12:45,720 --> 00:12:49,310
When she was a middle school student

174
00:12:50,570 --> 00:12:56,130
Hey Kazumi, come here for a second

175
00:12:57,380 --> 00:12:59,830
What are you doing?
-Don't worry about it. Just come here

176
00:13:00,450 --> 00:13:02,000
Three bad kids

177
00:13:03,580 --> 00:13:10,870
When I was in high school, it was a bad high school

178
00:13:11,140 --> 00:13:12,330
Called over

179
00:13:11,580 --> 00:13:14,980
Hey Kazumi, let's fight each other!

180
00:13:14,410 --> 00:13:16,000
Why?

181
00:13:16,000 --> 00:13:22,220
There were many heartless boys who were clamoring to fight me

182
00:13:22,220 --> 00:13:28,440
Giant! Giant! Giant! Giant! Giant!

183
00:13:26,460 --> 00:13:28,440
This is unforgivable!

184
00:13:30,080 --> 00:13:33,960
She's really angry.
-That's enough

185
00:13:34,800 --> 00:13:36,270
I won't lose to someone like this

186
00:13:44,470 --> 00:13:50,920
This bad kid, I knocked him out

187
00:13:50,920 --> 00:13:54,490
This didn't happen again after high school

188
00:13:55,770 --> 00:13:57,500
What the hell

189
00:13:58,120 --> 00:14:00,860
So cool

190
00:13:58,600 --> 00:13:59,580
What's more

191
00:14:02,120 --> 00:14:04,840
Why didn't you contact me?

192
00:14:04,840 --> 00:14:06,150
Boyfriend?

193
00:14:06,150 --> 00:14:13,000
My ex-boyfriend did something that can never be forgiven

194
00:14:12,330 --> 00:14:13,900
This is indeed unforgivable

195
00:14:13,000 --> 00:14:16,590
What are you doing?
-Kazumi

196
00:14:14,300 --> 00:14:16,590
Really had a boyfriend?

197
00:14:17,290 --> 00:14:23,220
I found my ex-boyfriend with another girl

198
00:14:23,660 --> 00:14:25,010
Girls too?

199
00:14:30,620 --> 00:14:31,840
Also hit girls?

200
00:14:30,620 --> 00:14:37,870
When I came back to my senses, I found that I had beaten both of them up

201
00:14:32,990 --> 00:14:36,490
Beat both of them up?

202
00:14:36,970 --> 00:14:39,600
Nonsense

203
00:14:45,020 --> 00:14:49,870
These are the cases of K. Kazumi's strange power

204
00:14:46,980 --> 00:14:48,580
Hmm

205
00:14:50,520 --> 00:14:55,180
Next, the last of the three characteristics of K. Kazumi

206
00:14:55,730 --> 00:14:58,210
An otherworldly level of appetite

207
00:14:56,830 --> 00:15:00,170
That's right, since has such a huge body

208
00:15:00,170 --> 00:15:07,560
My dinner is about 3 liters of white rice and about 30 plates of curry

209
00:15:07,860 --> 00:15:10,100
21 servings of Udon

210
00:15:10,100 --> 00:15:13,370
3 pots of salad

211
00:15:13,370 --> 00:15:15,730
72 kebab skewers

212
00:15:15,730 --> 00:15:17,820
12 oranges

213
00:15:17,820 --> 00:15:22,000
One meal?

214
00:15:18,230 --> 00:15:26,010
The amount of food is unbelievable, is this amount possible?

215
00:15:26,620 --> 00:15:29,840
We invited big eaters to consider it

216
00:15:29,840 --> 00:15:33,420
And asked them to confirm the amount of food

217
00:15:33,420 --> 00:15:38,850
This time I want to ask you to confirm the amount of food someone eats at a meal

218
00:15:38,850 --> 00:15:40,820
A meal's worth of food?
-Yes

219
00:15:47,010 --> 00:15:48,970
It's like school dinners

220
00:15:48,970 --> 00:15:52,270
This is one meal?
-Yes

221
00:15:52,540 --> 00:15:58,210
Probably all three of us together would struggle to finish all of this

222
00:15:58,210 --> 00:16:00,610
Really?

223
00:16:00,610 --> 00:16:06,950
If someone can finish this, its not anyone I know

224
00:16:07,170 --> 00:16:10,090
I can't imagine one person able to eat this much

225
00:16:10,090 --> 00:16:17,860
Even when I was the reigning champion, I had to fight to adjust my stomach capacity

226
00:16:17,860 --> 00:16:21,560
Only then could I eat over 10 kg at a time

227
00:16:21,800 --> 00:16:25,420
But you're telling me there's someone that has this much just for dinner...

228
00:16:25,420 --> 00:16:29,710
It makes me feel like my accomplishments are complete negated

229
00:16:30,420 --> 00:16:36,610
Even these big appetite warriors can not handle this amount of food

230
00:16:36,680 --> 00:16:40,550
The person who can finish this is called K. Kazumi

231
00:16:40,720 --> 00:16:46,120
K. Kazumi? K. Kazumi? I see

232
00:16:46,120 --> 00:16:48,620
I guess she probably can eat this

233
00:16:48,310 --> 00:16:49,540
I see

234
00:16:49,080 --> 00:16:53,360
It seems K. Kazumi is well-known in this field

235
00:16:53,920 --> 00:16:58,160
Sugawara and Angela are both aware of this individual

236
00:16:59,540 --> 00:17:01,040
How do you know about her?

237
00:17:01,040 --> 00:17:06,810
I searched eating records

238
00:17:06,810 --> 00:17:13,520
After looking at everyone's results, I found that one person's record is simply unbeatable

239
00:17:13,520 --> 00:17:14,820
I found out in this way

240
00:17:15,420 --> 00:17:23,160
At Wagyu Family Restaurant and the buffet soba at Wagyu Noodles Sagami

241
00:17:24,350 --> 00:17:28,820
A famous big eater set a record of 24 dishes

242
00:17:28,820 --> 00:17:36,870
K. Kazumi's record is 82, 3.5 times that amount

243
00:17:31,660 --> 00:17:35,020
It's really a record

244
00:17:37,140 --> 00:17:40,640
An official record

245
00:17:40,740 --> 00:17:42,280
Sugawara knows this person too?

246
00:17:42,280 --> 00:17:47,250
Although I know, but, how should I put it say, I don't take it seriously

247
00:17:47,250 --> 00:17:52,020
When I was a child, the Loch Ness Monster and Bigfoot

248
00:17:52,020 --> 00:17:54,820
These were popular for a while when I was a child

249
00:17:54,820 --> 00:17:58,360
I also categorize K. Kazumi in the same way

250
00:17:58,360 --> 00:18:01,100
Like those legends

251
00:18:01,100 --> 00:18:03,830
Although I think it's good to dream, I still don't believe it

252
00:18:04,230 --> 00:18:09,840
In addition, the most powerful food fighter, Kobayashi

253
00:18:10,320 --> 00:18:14,770
In the past, K. Kazumi once talked about eating 66 servings of soba noodles

254
00:18:14,770 --> 00:18:18,990
Regarding this 0.5kg record, Kobayashi commented

255
00:18:21,130 --> 00:18:25,070
They said that after not eating during the day, they ate 66 servings

256
00:18:25,070 --> 00:18:29,000
The weight of the soba alone is more than 10kg, its impossible

257
00:18:29,600 --> 00:18:35,080
This shows a fundamental misunderstanding of food fighting, its a lie

258
00:18:35,120 --> 00:18:39,690
I see

259
00:18:36,500 --> 00:18:39,690
A complete denial of the record

260
00:18:40,670 --> 00:18:47,880
But this picture is indeed published on the official website of SAGAMI

261
00:18:48,420 --> 00:18:53,060
As a listed company with 255 stores in the group

262
00:18:53,060 --> 00:18:56,720
It is hard to imagine that the company would engage in fabrication

263
00:18:57,170 --> 00:19:04,560
K. Kazumi, the mysterious legend, does she exist or not?

264
00:19:04,560 --> 00:19:07,730
What is the truth?

265
00:19:21,530 --> 00:19:22,460
Matsumoto, what do you think?

266
00:19:22,460 --> 00:19:29,750
Although there's so much info about this, i've never heard of it

267
00:19:29,750 --> 00:19:31,190
So I wont say anything for the moment

268
00:19:32,540 --> 00:19:34,660
We do not have the right to remain silent in this program!

269
00:19:34,660 --> 00:19:38,130
No, no, no, I can only say that I don't know

270
00:19:38,130 --> 00:19:39,480
Do you have any opinion about the strange powers

271
00:19:39,480 --> 00:19:41,730
Matsumoto, you are into fitness

272
00:19:41,730 --> 00:19:47,080
This part seems a bit fake

273
00:19:47,080 --> 00:19:50,420
But the last part of the soba store

274
00:19:50,420 --> 00:19:52,540
That record is not forged, right?

275
00:19:52,540 --> 00:19:54,480
There are records on the official website

276
00:19:54,580 --> 00:19:59,920
In the end, I feel I have to believe it!

277
00:19:59,920 --> 00:20:01,380
What do you think?

278
00:20:01,380 --> 00:20:04,190
Well, it all seems a little too cartoony

279
00:20:04,190 --> 00:20:08,010
But I do hope they exist

280
00:20:08,010 --> 00:20:10,380
Today will put an end to it

281
00:20:10,380 --> 00:20:13,080
So i'll be a little upset if this person didn't really exist

282
00:20:13,080 --> 00:20:14,060
Indeed

283
00:20:14,060 --> 00:20:16,500
Its a romantic idea for such a person to exist

284
00:20:16,500 --> 00:20:18,570
Yes, I still hope this person really exists

285
00:20:18,570 --> 00:20:23,370
So, now begins the search for K. Kazumi

286
00:20:25,110 --> 00:20:28,910
Does K. Kazumi exist or not?

287
00:20:29,670 --> 00:20:36,590
The information so far has been released solely by K. Kazumi herself

288
00:20:36,930 --> 00:20:43,020
Of all this information, this record is the only clue to her existence

289
00:20:38,440 --> 00:20:41,570
Strong evidence

290
00:20:44,740 --> 00:20:51,320
So we decided to visit the site of the record

291
00:20:48,490 --> 00:20:51,320
The best way

292
00:20:51,320 --> 00:20:55,270
SAGAMI in Higashimurayama, Wagyu Noodle Shop

293
00:21:00,190 --> 00:21:05,790
This is also a great opportunity to challenge the legendary record

294
00:21:06,680 --> 00:21:13,520
In the meantime, we will confirm K. Kazumi's records with the store staff behind the scenes

295
00:21:20,400 --> 00:21:21,300
Delicious

296
00:21:23,730 --> 00:21:26,500
I can eat a lot because i'm super hungry

297
00:21:26,800 --> 00:21:29,240
Another, please

298
00:21:32,310 --> 00:21:38,620
As expected of one of Japan's top food fights, they swallow soba noodles at high speed

299
00:21:39,110 --> 00:21:40,820
How many grams are in this serving?

300
00:21:40,820 --> 00:21:44,390
160g per serving
-It's a lot

301
00:21:44,820 --> 00:21:51,530
If the record is true

302
00:21:51,530 --> 00:21:55,180
The total weight would be more than 13kg

303
00:21:56,100 --> 00:21:58,000
How much can you eat at most?

304
00:21:58,000 --> 00:22:01,140
Depending on the food, people have different limits

305
00:22:01,140 --> 00:22:05,140
I'm afraid I can't eat that much soba

306
00:22:05,270 --> 00:22:07,410
It is more difficult for solids like this

307
00:22:07,410 --> 00:22:12,850
Although I have eaten 8.6kg of soba noodles, but that was a small bowl of soba

308
00:22:12,850 --> 00:22:16,320
That was easier to eat so i'm not sure with this one

309
00:22:16,450 --> 00:22:19,960
If its just soba, I can probably eat about 8kg at most

310
00:22:19,960 --> 00:22:25,590
This bowl has 160g, so 9kg is about 50 servings

311
00:22:25,590 --> 00:22:30,330
Even if it's a lie, at least tell a lie that is more or less believable, right?

312
00:22:30,330 --> 00:22:34,240
The authenticity of this record is currently being confirmed

313
00:22:34,690 --> 00:22:38,740
So, alongside the challenge

314
00:22:39,340 --> 00:22:43,610
We asked the store manager, Mr. Mishima, the following questions

315
00:22:43,610 --> 00:22:45,980
Is this record of 82 servings true?

316
00:22:45,980 --> 00:22:49,890
This record was before I came to this store

317
00:22:49,890 --> 00:22:53,690
I can only check with the head office

318
00:22:54,700 --> 00:22:58,840
Because there was no staff present at the time

319
00:22:58,840 --> 00:23:03,220
We asked him to confirm with the head office where the records were left

320
00:23:00,820 --> 00:23:03,830
Really? He really doesn't know?

321
00:23:06,400 --> 00:23:07,940
A little break

322
00:23:08,350 --> 00:23:14,230
At this point, the retired big eater feels he has eaten enough

323
00:23:15,010 --> 00:23:16,550
What do you think of 82 servings?

324
00:23:16,340 --> 00:23:20,360
This isn't a smoking break!

325
00:23:16,550 --> 00:23:20,580
It must be fake

326
00:23:20,360 --> 00:23:22,000
Definitely not gonna go back and eat more

327
00:23:21,150 --> 00:23:25,130
One hour after the start

328
00:23:25,130 --> 00:23:28,030
Sugawara and Angela also slow down

329
00:23:31,280 --> 00:23:35,800
Sorry, about the inquiry with the head office just now

330
00:23:35,800 --> 00:23:40,040
Sure enough, the head office also gave a definite reply that it is true

331
00:23:40,040 --> 00:23:44,370
Eh, really?
-There's no doubt about this record

332
00:23:43,350 --> 00:23:45,280
No doubt
-Jeez

333
00:23:44,370 --> 00:23:45,270
I see

334
00:23:45,270 --> 00:23:49,040
After confirming with SAGAMI head office

335
00:23:49,630 --> 00:23:55,100
They confirmed that K. Kazumi's records are factual

336
00:23:56,590 --> 00:23:59,860
They said K. Kazumi really ate 82 servings

337
00:23:59,860 --> 00:24:03,630
It can't be. Really?

338
00:24:03,560 --> 00:24:06,480
It's a shock!

339
00:24:06,530 --> 00:24:08,330
I don't want to believe it!

340
00:24:08,330 --> 00:24:12,000
The competitive eating world will be turned upside down
-For sure

341
00:24:12,000 --> 00:24:15,740
Demotivation in the face of such astonishing facts

342
00:24:17,510 --> 00:24:21,510
We've now heard their confirmation

343
00:24:21,640 --> 00:24:26,380
Until now we just heard some rumors and saw some pictures

344
00:24:27,000 --> 00:24:30,750
And yet, I still find it hard to believe

345
00:24:31,290 --> 00:24:37,990
The big appetite warriors still cannot accept this unrealistic record

346
00:24:38,760 --> 00:24:44,300
After that, Sugawara and Angela continued to eat soba

347
00:24:45,220 --> 00:24:47,970
The meal ended with the following results

348
00:24:46,530 --> 00:24:49,030
Not even half of the record

349
00:24:48,620 --> 00:24:52,640
Despite being higher than other female competitors in the ranking

350
00:24:52,640 --> 00:24:55,140
K. Kazumi's record is still out of reach

351
00:24:55,770 --> 00:25:00,980
Only by combining each are they able to meet the same amount

352
00:25:01,120 --> 00:25:02,920
The total amount of three people

353
00:25:04,850 --> 00:25:06,660
Its really awful

354
00:25:07,110 --> 00:25:13,000
After the location shoot, while greeting the store manager

355
00:25:13,000 --> 00:25:17,400
At the Koganei branch of "Aji no Mingei", a subsidiary of our company group

356
00:25:17,400 --> 00:25:20,100
K. Kazumi also has a record there

357
00:25:20,900 --> 00:25:25,740
As a result, we received information that K. Kazumi's records were also left in the sister store

358
00:25:27,040 --> 00:25:31,210
So, we rushed to the location to conduct an interview

359
00:25:31,870 --> 00:25:36,820
It is true that there is a 50 udon noodles-serving record left under the name of "Kazu"

360
00:25:37,620 --> 00:25:42,760
An oversized record with a total weight of 12kg

361
00:25:42,760 --> 00:25:44,590
I didn't actually meet this diner

362
00:25:44,750 --> 00:25:49,570
No one here saw her either

363
00:25:45,900 --> 00:25:49,570
Why?
- No, this is too strange

364
00:25:50,220 --> 00:25:57,910
So we sent a request for assistance to the SAGAMI head office, which keeps detailed records

365
00:25:57,910 --> 00:26:02,580
In response, we received a reply from the head office

366
00:26:01,740 --> 00:26:03,290
Need help finding it?

367
00:26:02,580 --> 00:26:05,430
Saying they would help find employees who knew about K. Kazumi

368
00:26:05,890 --> 00:26:08,330
So while we waited for a response

369
00:26:08,330 --> 00:26:11,390
There must be some, right?

370
00:26:09,780 --> 00:26:14,090
We enlisted the help of a detective agency

371
00:26:14,470 --> 00:26:19,730
Who questioned passersby on streets where there were rumors of sightings

372
00:26:19,730 --> 00:26:22,160
Have you heard of K. Kazumi?

373
00:26:23,400 --> 00:26:27,270
Tall person, right? Like an urban legend

374
00:26:27,690 --> 00:26:31,210
No results were yielded

375
00:26:32,300 --> 00:26:36,730
Three weeks after sending an inquiry to SAGAMI head office

376
00:26:37,850 --> 00:26:45,720
We received a reply saying that three employees knew about K. Kazumi

377
00:26:46,420 --> 00:26:48,460
It would be strange if this were not the case

378
00:26:49,090 --> 00:26:50,090
Finally

379
00:26:50,640 --> 00:26:55,330
So we rushed to the SAGAMI head office in Nagoya

380
00:26:55,330 --> 00:26:58,070
To meet with one of the individuals in question

381
00:27:02,000 --> 00:27:03,970
I am the person

382
00:27:04,440 --> 00:27:08,130
This is one of the employees who knows K. Kazumi

383
00:27:08,130 --> 00:27:11,910
Mr. Imamura, General Manager of SAGAMI Corporation

384
00:27:12,850 --> 00:27:16,550
We are hoping to conduct an interview with K. Kazumi

385
00:27:16,550 --> 00:27:21,390
Is K. Kazumi a real person?

386
00:27:21,490 --> 00:27:23,760
It's true. I've seen her before

387
00:27:24,730 --> 00:27:25,960
She exists!

388
00:27:26,530 --> 00:27:29,870
Is K. Kazumi a real person?

389
00:27:29,970 --> 00:27:32,230
It's true. I've seen her before

390
00:27:33,600 --> 00:27:36,640
I've met her before

391
00:27:37,100 --> 00:27:40,310
Finally, an eyewitness is found

392
00:27:40,870 --> 00:27:45,710
As expected, the legendary K. Kazumi is a real person

393
00:27:46,650 --> 00:27:51,190
How were you able to meet K. Kazumi directly?

394
00:27:51,190 --> 00:27:57,960
Our company has also opened several stores in Bangkok, Thailand

395
00:27:57,960 --> 00:28:05,370
K. Kazumi, as the record holder in Japan

396
00:28:05,370 --> 00:28:07,070
We invited her to the opening ceremony of one of our stores there

397
00:28:07,070 --> 00:28:08,900
I see

398
00:28:09,320 --> 00:28:13,280
Mr. Imamura, met her while in Bangkok

399
00:28:13,780 --> 00:28:20,120
What was his impression of K. Kazumi?

400
00:28:20,450 --> 00:28:21,680
What kind of person is she?

401
00:28:21,680 --> 00:28:28,320
I was in charge of the kitchen at the time

402
00:28:28,660 --> 00:28:33,460
So basically, I only remember that she was there

403
00:28:33,460 --> 00:28:36,200
I don't know any more details about the situation

404
00:28:36,300 --> 00:28:38,930
But for example, she was taller than 2m and so on

405
00:28:38,930 --> 00:28:42,970
No, no, no, really is a super ordinary woman

406
00:28:42,970 --> 00:28:45,670
Ordinary women?
-Yes

407
00:28:45,670 --> 00:28:49,480
2m? Absolutely not, really is completely normal

408
00:28:49,610 --> 00:28:52,650
So she's not fat either?
-No

409
00:28:53,020 --> 00:28:55,990
A sudden shocking discovery

410
00:28:54,300 --> 00:28:55,310
What's going on here?

411
00:28:56,360 --> 00:29:01,020
K. Kazumi is not a woman with a huge body size of 2m in height and 200kg in weight

412
00:29:02,800 --> 00:29:06,060
What the hell?

413
00:29:06,060 --> 00:29:10,170
So, this remarkable witness finally confirms her existence

414
00:29:10,170 --> 00:29:15,970
Although the amount of food is true, she's actually small?

415
00:29:15,970 --> 00:29:17,740
This is what he says

416
00:29:18,370 --> 00:29:22,240
In a sense it's even scarier

417
00:29:22,240 --> 00:29:27,950
Is anything else a lie, like the frying pan and stuff?

418
00:29:28,880 --> 00:29:31,790
Its like big Freiza suddenly becoming smaller

419
00:29:31,790 --> 00:29:33,520
The final form is unexpectedly small

420
00:29:33,520 --> 00:29:35,460
And with deformation, right?

421
00:29:35,460 --> 00:29:37,330
Very romantic

422
00:29:37,680 --> 00:29:43,730
I suspect that this is a multi-person group calling themselves K. Kazumi

423
00:29:43,730 --> 00:29:48,800
Everyone is eating together and keeping up the pretense of this story

424
00:29:48,800 --> 00:29:52,490
Not one person, that seems likely

425
00:29:52,490 --> 00:29:54,710
If this is not the case then it really does not make sense

426
00:29:54,710 --> 00:29:56,410
So, lets get started

427
00:29:56,410 --> 00:29:59,750
Who is K. Kazumi?

428
00:29:59,750 --> 00:30:02,610
Her face will finally be revealed

429
00:30:02,610 --> 00:30:04,290
Really?
-Will we really find out?

430
00:30:05,120 --> 00:30:11,020
Next we will visit the second person who knows about K. Kazumi

431
00:30:12,290 --> 00:30:14,840
It's this person

432
00:30:16,650 --> 00:30:20,140
At the Higashimurayama store where K. Kazumi left a record

433
00:30:20,140 --> 00:30:24,030
Honda, who has been working part-time since the opening of the business

434
00:30:24,910 --> 00:30:27,840
We are investigating K. Kazumi

435
00:30:27,840 --> 00:30:30,450
Do you know K. Kazumi?

436
00:30:30,450 --> 00:30:33,280
Although I am a part-time team leader of the night shift

437
00:30:33,280 --> 00:30:42,120
Before I heard that during the day someone ate 35 portions of soba

438
00:30:42,120 --> 00:30:46,660
35 servings?
-Yes, 35 initially

439
00:30:46,660 --> 00:30:49,630
I also heard that there were people who could eat very well before

440
00:30:49,630 --> 00:30:54,740
People in the restaurant were talking about 35 servings

441
00:30:54,740 --> 00:30:58,120
Not quite sure if was due to work

442
00:30:58,120 --> 00:31:00,710
But the person gradually started coming here at night too

443
00:31:00,710 --> 00:31:04,650
I served her soba noodles once

444
00:31:04,650 --> 00:31:09,350
The last time I saw her was about two years ago

445
00:31:09,920 --> 00:31:15,620
She hasn't seen her since the last time she was served two years ago

446
00:31:16,080 --> 00:31:22,100
Here we attempt to confirm about the 82 servings

447
00:31:22,100 --> 00:31:25,700
Instead of saying she's a big eater

448
00:31:25,700 --> 00:31:29,770
As far as I can remember, she was just enjoying the soba noodles

449
00:31:30,270 --> 00:31:34,770
Is the record of 82 servings real?
-Yes, it's the soba I served

450
00:31:34,770 --> 00:31:37,050
You served it?
-Yes

451
00:31:37,050 --> 00:31:41,050
What was the situation then?
-That day she was particularly into it

452
00:31:41,050 --> 00:31:44,040
At first she was ordering three servings at a time, then it became five

453
00:31:44,040 --> 00:31:46,820
Then five at a time, one after another

454
00:31:46,820 --> 00:31:53,090
I also remember telling the backroom staff, "I think she's especially into it today, please speed up."

455
00:31:53,090 --> 00:31:55,300
Isn't the record of 82 servings very impressive?

456
00:31:55,300 --> 00:32:00,540
Yes, at that time it was unparalleled

457
00:32:00,540 --> 00:32:02,770
I have never seen 5 servings of noodles so quickly eaten at once

458
00:32:03,200 --> 00:32:07,440
Did they have any leftovers?
-No

459
00:32:07,440 --> 00:32:10,500
I was going back and forth between the back kitchen and the restaurant endlessly

460
00:32:10,500 --> 00:32:11,810
So you've seen how she eats?

461
00:32:11,810 --> 00:32:15,150
Yes, her eating and asking for more

462
00:32:15,150 --> 00:32:17,120
I had to adjust my pace accordingly

463
00:32:17,150 --> 00:32:17,950
This is how it went

464
00:32:17,950 --> 00:32:22,020
Was it a trick or anything?
-Not at all

465
00:32:22,540 --> 00:32:26,290
Honda witnessed the birth of the record

466
00:32:27,580 --> 00:32:32,300
Sure enough, the 82 servings is an irrefutable fact

467
00:32:30,960 --> 00:32:32,300
That's incredible

468
00:32:34,370 --> 00:32:38,640
There is a rumor online that she is 2m tall

469
00:32:38,870 --> 00:32:41,480
No, not at all

470
00:32:41,480 --> 00:32:42,640
Really?
-Yes

471
00:32:42,780 --> 00:32:46,410
What about 170cm?
-Hm, well, probably

472
00:32:46,980 --> 00:32:51,790
This point about her huge physique being untrue is also confirmed

473
00:32:52,500 --> 00:33:01,800
The legend of K. Kazumi's is even more mysterious in terms of authenticity

474
00:32:57,060 --> 00:32:58,140
Only the big appetite is clear

475
00:33:02,120 --> 00:33:06,000
The last one who knows K. Kazumi

476
00:33:06,410 --> 00:33:10,190
The SAGAMI Tsurunoshima Branch Manager Miyazaki

477
00:33:10,840 --> 00:33:15,280
Were you the manager of the Higashimurayama store, when the 82-serving record was set?

478
00:33:15,280 --> 00:33:17,580
Yes, i've been there for almost 5 years

479
00:33:18,480 --> 00:33:22,850
So, when the record was set at that time
-I was there, yes

480
00:33:23,280 --> 00:33:25,990
Isn't 82 servings a very impressive record?

481
00:33:25,990 --> 00:33:31,490
Wouldn't they get interviewed on TV or in magazines or anything like that?

482
00:33:31,490 --> 00:33:33,560
There were interview requests

483
00:33:33,830 --> 00:33:37,270
For K. Kazumi?
Yes, for K. Kazumi

484
00:33:37,270 --> 00:33:39,200
How were they dealt with?

485
00:33:39,200 --> 00:33:46,780
I contacted K. Kazumi personally

486
00:33:46,780 --> 00:33:52,310
Told her someone wants to interview her

487
00:33:52,310 --> 00:33:55,350
Did she reject you?
-Yes

488
00:33:55,720 --> 00:34:00,820
So you know K. Kazumi's phone number, right?

489
00:34:01,560 --> 00:34:03,490
Yes, I know it

490
00:34:03,770 --> 00:34:10,330
Finally, we have found someone who can contact K. Kazumi directly

491
00:34:10,880 --> 00:34:12,090
So

492
00:34:12,770 --> 00:34:16,840
We really want to meet this person, can you please contact her on our behalf?

493
00:34:16,840 --> 00:34:19,370
I'll try

494
00:34:19,370 --> 00:34:26,650
Just say it's a TBS show. We'd really like to meet with her.
-Okay

495
00:34:23,450 --> 00:34:25,180
That's right. Don't reveal the name of the show

496
00:34:26,320 --> 00:34:27,920
Please have some confidence!

497
00:34:26,780 --> 00:34:31,320
But it seems she doesn't like this type of thing...

498
00:34:31,320 --> 00:34:34,260
Making appearances?
-Yes

499
00:34:34,260 --> 00:34:37,090
So it might be a little difficult.
-I see

500
00:34:37,090 --> 00:34:43,330
After waiting for a week, we received contact from Miyazaki

501
00:34:44,010 --> 00:34:51,670
If the conditions for obscuring the face and sound can be met

502
00:34:52,070 --> 00:34:55,030
K. Kazumi is willing to be interviewed

503
00:34:56,540 --> 00:35:00,420
So far, she has never accepted a request to appear on TV

504
00:35:00,420 --> 00:35:03,190
Why did she choose to accept it this time?

505
00:35:05,020 --> 00:35:09,420
K. Kazumi will be on set soon
-Then let's shoot

506
00:35:09,790 --> 00:35:15,160
And what about the false claims of being more than 2m in height with strange powers?

507
00:35:15,860 --> 00:35:22,640
Why have fake daily routines been detailed online for 12 years?

508
00:35:24,000 --> 00:35:28,280
Next, the truth will be revealed

509
00:35:46,220 --> 00:35:49,390
The Confessions of K. Kazumi

510
00:35:54,320 --> 00:35:56,410
Looks very ordinary

511
00:35:58,740 --> 00:36:00,780
Please take a seat

512
00:36:05,980 --> 00:36:09,680
Are you K. Kazumi?
-Yes

513
00:36:09,920 --> 00:36:12,590
We've been searching for K. Kazumi

514
00:36:12,590 --> 00:36:16,220
We are honored to meet you.
-Thank you

515
00:36:16,220 --> 00:36:19,090
Although there are many questions I would like to ask you

516
00:36:19,090 --> 00:36:24,400
Seeing you like this, you don't appear to be 2m tall

517
00:36:24,400 --> 00:36:28,270
Did you make that up?

518
00:36:28,270 --> 00:36:33,910
It's a lie. I was stunned when I first heard it myself

519
00:36:34,580 --> 00:36:38,610
So it wasn't you who said it?

520
00:36:38,610 --> 00:36:40,750
Not me

521
00:36:40,750 --> 00:36:44,320
Who wrote it?
-I don't know. I'd like to know too

522
00:36:45,860 --> 00:36:52,130
Shockingly, the account on Yahoo is not operated by the real K. Kazumi

523
00:36:52,840 --> 00:36:54,900
What's going on here?
-It's complicated

524
00:36:54,900 --> 00:37:01,240
Is all the information about K. Kazumi posted on the Internet false?

525
00:37:01,870 --> 00:37:04,370
Yes, it's all fake

526
00:37:04,930 --> 00:37:12,380
The information about K. Kazumi online is all false, except for SAGAMI's records

527
00:37:12,970 --> 00:37:16,640
None of the information was released by K. Kazumi herself

528
00:37:16,640 --> 00:37:20,720
And it is unknown who the perpetrator is

529
00:37:22,560 --> 00:37:26,230
How did you see all the information on Yahoo?

530
00:37:26,230 --> 00:37:33,840
Well, my daughter happened to search for "K. Kazumi" online

531
00:37:33,840 --> 00:37:41,580
But it wasn't me that posted it, I didn't even know of the website itself

532
00:37:41,580 --> 00:37:49,450
When I saw it, I didn't understand what kind of person was using the name K. Kazumi

533
00:37:50,290 --> 00:37:57,330
How did you feel when you first learned that someone was spreading false information?

534
00:37:57,330 --> 00:38:00,900
Shocked, the image didn't fit me at all

535
00:38:00,900 --> 00:38:04,100
I just like soba, that's all

536
00:38:06,240 --> 00:38:08,170
That's the most impressive thing

537
00:38:09,520 --> 00:38:16,580
As K. Kazumi herself has no desire whatsoever to attract the attention of others

538
00:38:17,240 --> 00:38:22,320
How did the account talking about her appetite and physique earlier

539
00:38:22,320 --> 00:38:26,480
Know about the record that was made later?

540
00:38:26,480 --> 00:38:31,690
The name seems to have been changed afterwards

541
00:38:31,830 --> 00:38:37,070
I don't mean to offend you, but you are K. Kazumi, right?

542
00:38:37,070 --> 00:38:39,930
Yes, it's me.
-Okay

543
00:38:39,930 --> 00:38:46,110
When I was at SAGAMI, the clerk told me, "Please use your initials to come up with a name"

544
00:38:46,110 --> 00:38:50,650
I casually said, "Let's use the name "K. Kazumi"

545
00:38:50,650 --> 00:38:56,920
K. Kazumi is your name, right?

546
00:38:56,920 --> 00:39:00,490
Your name is Kazumi, right?
-Yes, it is

547
00:39:01,180 --> 00:39:09,260
At this point, we reconfirmed the details of the record

548
00:39:10,730 --> 00:39:14,440
Is your record of 82 servings also true?

549
00:39:14,440 --> 00:39:17,910
It's true.
-That's incredible

550
00:39:16,300 --> 00:39:18,270
That's awesome

551
00:39:17,910 --> 00:39:21,240
I just kept eating and ended up having at 82 servings

552
00:39:23,110 --> 00:39:24,810
That's what happened?

553
00:39:25,160 --> 00:39:27,540
Ate and ate until you ate 82?

554
00:39:25,450 --> 00:39:30,150
When did you start these challenges?

555
00:39:31,590 --> 00:39:36,360
About 3 or 4 years ago, only at SAGAMI

556
00:39:36,360 --> 00:39:41,600
Really likes soba

557
00:39:36,360 --> 00:39:42,060
The more I ate, the more delicious it became, then it ended up as a challenge

558
00:39:42,060 --> 00:39:46,030
Its hard to believe this amount can be eaten just accidentally

559
00:39:46,030 --> 00:39:48,040
Did you prepare in anyway?

560
00:39:51,370 --> 00:39:55,410
I guess I didn't eat much the day before

561
00:39:55,410 --> 00:40:00,650
But its true that eating at a buffet isn't great for your health

562
00:40:00,650 --> 00:40:06,720
So because of this I don't really do it anymore

563
00:40:06,720 --> 00:40:09,960
You mean

564
00:40:09,960 --> 00:40:11,590
Because it affects your physical condition?

565
00:40:11,590 --> 00:40:13,560
Pretty much, yeah

566
00:40:14,060 --> 00:40:18,900
Now i usually only eat a normal bowl of rice

567
00:40:19,410 --> 00:40:21,640
So you usually eat a small or just average amount of food?

568
00:40:21,640 --> 00:40:27,010
Yes, if I go to a convenience store, I usually just have one or two rice balls

569
00:40:27,010 --> 00:40:33,510
What about TV appearances for eating, have you ever received an invitation?

570
00:40:33,510 --> 00:40:39,220
There were invitations through SAGAMI, but I turned them all down

571
00:40:38,620 --> 00:40:39,880
No interest in doing it

572
00:40:39,220 --> 00:40:44,030
What about invitations for TV interviews like ours?
-This is the first time

573
00:40:44,030 --> 00:40:47,600
Why did you accept our invitation to be interviewed this time?

574
00:40:48,760 --> 00:40:52,300
First of all, I didn't know that K. Kazumi existed before

575
00:40:52,300 --> 00:40:53,770
You mean K. Kazumi on the Internet?
-Yes

576
00:40:53,770 --> 00:40:59,840
So I didn't expect an interview about this specifically

577
00:40:59,840 --> 00:41:05,510
After actually learning about the online situation, that its a fake account

578
00:41:05,510 --> 00:41:11,970
Someone's pretending to be me, so I wanted to state its a fake

579
00:41:13,300 --> 00:41:17,180
So, the K. Kazumi on the Internet is an impostor

580
00:41:17,180 --> 00:41:19,430
To convey this reality

581
00:41:19,900 --> 00:41:25,500
She made up her mind to make a one and only TV appearance

582
00:41:25,500 --> 00:41:27,570
If you don't mind

583
00:41:27,570 --> 00:41:32,810
Can you tell us your actual height and weight or foot size?

584
00:41:32,810 --> 00:41:40,010
Height 167cm Weight about 59 to 60 kg

585
00:41:38,300 --> 00:41:40,080
Normal

586
00:41:40,010 --> 00:41:42,850
The shoe size is 24.5cm

587
00:41:42,320 --> 00:41:44,010
It is indeed very ordinary

588
00:41:42,850 --> 00:41:50,460
The height written on the Internet is 213cm and weight is 222kg
-Nonsense

589
00:41:45,960 --> 00:41:50,530
That's too much.
-Why did you tell her that?

590
00:41:50,460 --> 00:41:54,160
I would also like to ask you about your age range if that's ok

591
00:41:54,160 --> 00:41:57,470
Between 55 and 60

592
00:41:57,470 --> 00:42:02,300
You are also married, right? You have a daughter?
-Yes

593
00:42:02,300 --> 00:42:09,970
There are rumors on the Internet that your husband is a lawyer.
-That's not true

594
00:42:09,980 --> 00:42:15,750
K. Kazumi-san, you're not a housewife, but you have a job, right?
-Yes, I do

595
00:42:15,750 --> 00:42:19,620
What do you do for a living?
-No comment

596
00:42:19,620 --> 00:42:21,020
Apologies

597
00:42:21,020 --> 00:42:29,000
Finally, after this program is broadcast, the real situation should be known to the public

598
00:42:29,360 --> 00:42:33,530
Do you have any hopes for the future?

599
00:42:34,360 --> 00:42:39,310
Hopes for the future. On the impostor

600
00:42:39,310 --> 00:42:43,840
I hope that the person pretending to be me can bear the corresponding responsibility

601
00:42:42,750 --> 00:42:44,020
Indeed

602
00:42:43,840 --> 00:42:45,950
I hope they disappear

603
00:42:47,110 --> 00:42:51,150
On the existence of K. Kazumi

604
00:42:51,150 --> 00:42:53,220
You want it to be over

605
00:42:53,490 --> 00:42:57,160
In short, I hope the impostor will disappear

606
00:42:57,160 --> 00:43:04,800
That the truth comes to light

607
00:43:04,800 --> 00:43:07,270
That's all for the interview, thank you.
-Thank you

608
00:43:07,270 --> 00:43:10,230
Thank you so much for coming!

609
00:43:07,700 --> 00:43:12,970
Thank you very much. Thank you very much.
-Thank you

610
00:43:15,660 --> 00:43:17,070
Which way is it?

611
00:43:16,140 --> 00:43:22,050
K. Kazumi just wants a quiet life

612
00:43:18,620 --> 00:43:20,130
She came from the right

613
00:43:23,220 --> 00:43:25,620
Have you seen this?

614
00:43:25,620 --> 00:43:27,990
Must've seen this

615
00:43:27,990 --> 00:43:29,490
Can we take this as a souvenir?

616
00:43:29,490 --> 00:43:32,430
No, I don't want to see that

617
00:43:33,260 --> 00:43:36,360
I don't want to see this

618
00:43:36,370 --> 00:43:38,570
So who is this?
-Yeah

619
00:43:42,800 --> 00:43:47,910
In conclusion, K. Kazumi exists

620
00:43:47,910 --> 00:43:55,120
However, the version online is not the actual person

621
00:43:55,120 --> 00:43:57,850
So we don't know who that photo is, right?

622
00:43:57,850 --> 00:44:01,290
It must be photoshopped

623
00:44:01,290 --> 00:44:04,390
Maybe someone was mistaken for K. Kazumi

624
00:44:04,390 --> 00:44:08,070
Randomly uploaded a picture and mistaken for K. Kazumi

625
00:44:08,070 --> 00:44:13,140
There may be such a person

626
00:44:13,140 --> 00:44:18,010
With this body and strange power

627
00:44:18,010 --> 00:44:21,380
It's impressive. It's really impressive

628
00:44:21,380 --> 00:44:23,410
Yeah, right.
-Just agreeing to be in the show is already a big deal

629
00:44:23,410 --> 00:44:31,680
First of all, there really is a woman that can eat that much soba

630
00:44:31,680 --> 00:44:33,650
Such a woman exists

631
00:44:33,650 --> 00:44:36,890
This urban legend is incredible

632
00:44:36,890 --> 00:44:43,520
Yes, especially considering the fact that the professional eaters said its impossible

633
00:44:43,520 --> 00:44:46,740
And that she just likes it
-So she ate and ate and ate

634
00:44:46,740 --> 00:44:48,500
Set a record in such a way

635
00:44:48,500 --> 00:44:51,420
Its so weird
-It's awesome

636
00:44:51,420 --> 00:44:55,010
That's great.
-After 82 servings, her health got worse

637
00:44:55,010 --> 00:44:57,010
That's right.
-It's horrible, isn't it?

638
00:44:57,010 --> 00:45:04,120
In short, we've just watched an hour-long episode about someone that simply loves soba

639
00:45:04,120 --> 00:45:11,660
SAGAMI's soba buffet is available for only 1980 yen

640
00:45:11,660 --> 00:45:15,230
Tempura is also available

641
00:45:15,230 --> 00:45:16,560
Tempura is very important!

642
00:45:16,560 --> 00:45:19,270
Only 1980 yen with tempura!

643
00:45:19,270 --> 00:45:21,310
This was obviously requested

644
00:45:21,310 --> 00:45:21,970
A requirement

645
00:45:22,390 --> 00:45:24,000
Surely a condition for helping, right?

646
00:45:24,000 --> 00:45:27,240
SAGAMI is not that type of place

647
00:45:27,240 --> 00:45:28,210
You have to do what they say

648
00:45:28,210 --> 00:45:30,910
Don't underestimate the magnitude of SAGAMI

649
00:45:30,910 --> 00:45:31,910
There are no conditions attached

650
00:45:31,910 --> 00:45:34,380
Our buffet comes with tempura!

651
00:45:34,380 --> 00:45:36,950
This statement only represents my personal feelings

652
00:45:37,610 --> 00:45:38,790
Well, then Takahashi, you've eaten it before, right?

653
00:45:38,790 --> 00:45:42,790
Not as of yet, no
-You haven't!?

654
00:45:42,790 --> 00:46:14,750
