1
00:00:01,000 --> 00:00:02,820
Tonight, made public at last:

2
00:00:09,580 --> 00:00:12,990
The comedian with the most outrageous snoring makes his appearance.

3
00:00:14,600 --> 00:00:18,160
His snoring is something to behold.

4
00:00:40,240 --> 00:00:42,060
It sure is hot, right?

5
00:00:41,150 --> 00:00:42,060
Hot indeed!

6
00:00:42,060 --> 00:00:44,980
People are usually on the edge when it's hot.

7
00:00:45,410 --> 00:00:47,980
A lot of annoying things have been happening lately.

8
00:00:48,740 --> 00:00:50,240
Not just because it's hot right?

9
00:00:50,240 --> 00:00:51,400
Have you gone there?

10
00:00:51,100 --> 00:00:51,400
Where?

11
00:00:51,400 --> 00:00:53,720
I heard you've visited this place.

12
00:00:53,320 --> 00:00:54,820
Where?

13
00:00:53,720 --> 00:00:54,820
A golf bar...

14
00:00:55,500 --> 00:00:57,620
I still visit that place.

15
00:00:57,620 --> 00:00:59,320
You're still going?

16
00:00:59,320 --> 00:01:01,080
I mean, I play golf so...

17
00:01:01,080 --> 00:01:05,070
Miyasako said: "A golf bar is pretty interesting, shall we go?"

18
00:01:05,070 --> 00:01:06,600
So we ended up going together.

19
00:01:06,820 --> 00:01:09,220
It's a bar, but it's also golf.

20
00:01:11,470 --> 00:01:13,960
They've got this screen and you hit the ball on it...

21
00:01:13,960 --> 00:01:18,120
...so it's kind of like you're playing golf.

22
00:01:18,400 --> 00:01:21,770
They have several rooms and you have to wait.

23
00:01:22,320 --> 00:01:24,060
Then when one is finally available...

24
00:01:24,340 --> 00:01:25,540
"Please come this way."

25
00:01:25,540 --> 00:01:27,580
This shit is really expensive too!

26
00:01:27,740 --> 00:01:29,160
There's a caddy as well, and he goes like...

27
00:01:29,160 --> 00:01:31,740
..."would you like to hit some balls for practice?"

28
00:01:31,990 --> 00:01:34,520
Yes yes, so I hit a few balls.

29
00:01:34,520 --> 00:01:37,980
About 250... feet? Not feet right?

30
00:01:37,980 --> 00:01:39,120
Yards.

31
00:01:38,520 --> 00:01:39,120
Yards!

32
00:01:39,290 --> 00:01:40,700
"You're actually pretty good!"

33
00:01:40,700 --> 00:01:42,820
Yeah, I can kinda do this stuff.

34
00:01:42,820 --> 00:01:46,290
"Alright, should we get started then?"

35
00:01:46,290 --> 00:01:47,640
Okay let's go!

36
00:01:47,640 --> 00:01:49,870
So I hit and...

37
00:01:51,550 --> 00:01:54,200
And the next one...

38
00:01:54,360 --> 00:01:56,250
Do your best!

39
00:01:57,150 --> 00:01:59,740
The caddy and his half-assed cheering.

40
00:01:59,740 --> 00:02:01,410
"Should we hit one more?"

41
00:02:01,410 --> 00:02:05,200
So I hit again...

42
00:02:05,680 --> 00:02:07,600
"Nice... shot..."

43
00:02:07,600 --> 00:02:09,600
HOW WAS THAT NICE!?

44
00:02:11,650 --> 00:02:14,160
I'LL NEVER COME TO THIS SHOP AGAIN!

45
00:02:14,300 --> 00:02:18,300
AND I'LL NEVER WALK NEAR THIS SHOP AGAIN EITHER, IDIOT!

46
00:02:18,830 --> 00:02:20,380
I went home after 10 minutes.

47
00:02:21,740 --> 00:02:22,790
You see...

48
00:02:22,860 --> 00:02:24,660
Is this really something to sweat this much about?

49
00:02:27,520 --> 00:02:31,380
Why are you getting mad because you can't hit properly?

50
00:02:29,370 --> 00:02:31,380
NO I WAS HITTING IT!

51
00:02:31,420 --> 00:02:33,300
Even when I hit a good ball it was like...

52
00:02:33,300 --> 00:02:36,640
...it didn't seem to have registered the ball.

53
00:02:36,640 --> 00:02:38,700
The screen didn't register.

54
00:02:38,700 --> 00:02:40,880
HOW USELESS TO NOT REGISTER!

55
00:02:40,880 --> 00:02:45,200
Obviously something hit the screen!

56
00:02:45,190 --> 00:02:48,220
"Sorry, it seems to not have registered, could you hit it again please?"

57
00:02:48,220 --> 00:02:49,670
Alright...

58
00:02:49,670 --> 00:02:53,660
So the next shit ball I hit, why does that one register?

59
00:02:55,770 --> 00:02:58,680
I don't know about that but...

60
00:02:56,620 --> 00:02:58,680
I was so annoyed.

61
00:03:00,650 --> 00:03:04,220
Also, I don't know why you are giving me such a cold response when I'm talking about a golf bar.

62
00:03:04,830 --> 00:03:07,860
I mean, it's not a shop to get that mad about.

63
00:03:07,960 --> 00:03:09,580
The other day as well, at my place...

64
00:03:09,580 --> 00:03:12,660
...I thought about going to sleep.

65
00:03:13,330 --> 00:03:14,660
I opened up my fridge...

66
00:03:14,840 --> 00:03:16,910
...you usually have these jars in there, right?

67
00:03:16,910 --> 00:03:18,880
Something about them was bothering me.

68
00:03:18,880 --> 00:03:20,740
So I decided to rearrange them a bit.

69
00:03:20,740 --> 00:03:25,640
And out of nowhere, BANG. Completely shattered.

70
00:03:25,640 --> 00:03:30,100
Super thick soumen sauce, everywhere.

71
00:03:31,540 --> 00:03:34,020
In the middle of the night, in my kitchen.

72
00:03:34,190 --> 00:03:38,620
Super thick soumen sauce and some other stuff, everywhere.

73
00:03:40,640 --> 00:03:43,380
I just... I just... I couldn't move.

74
00:03:44,370 --> 00:03:47,820
I'm mostly surprised that you eat soumen at home.

75
00:03:50,590 --> 00:03:52,720
Of course, I have it just in case.

76
00:03:52,720 --> 00:03:56,550
In that kind of situation, what would you do?

77
00:03:56,550 --> 00:03:57,180
What do you mean?

78
00:03:57,180 --> 00:03:59,200
I can't vacuum that stuff.

79
00:03:59,550 --> 00:04:00,160
Oh, right.

80
00:04:00,160 --> 00:04:02,290
But shards went all over the place, right?

81
00:04:02,290 --> 00:04:05,000
You can't really move because you'll pierce your feet.

82
00:04:05,910 --> 00:04:08,020
So I had no idea what to even begin with.

83
00:04:08,590 --> 00:04:10,200
I just wanted to sleep, really sleep.

84
00:04:11,330 --> 00:04:13,790
But this super thick soumen sauce is everywhere!

85
00:04:14,540 --> 00:04:15,550
Okay dude.

86
00:04:17,720 --> 00:04:20,280
Very carefully I moved backwards.

87
00:04:20,280 --> 00:04:23,600
I grabbed a cloth and carefully wiped it up.

88
00:04:23,600 --> 00:04:26,580
But it was super sticky.

89
00:04:26,580 --> 00:04:27,250
And why was that?

90
00:04:27,250 --> 00:04:30,300
Because it was super thick soumen sauce.

91
00:04:27,900 --> 00:04:30,300
I see.

92
00:04:30,380 --> 00:04:33,460
Before I knew it, two hours had already passed.

93
00:04:33,880 --> 00:04:35,800
I want to get it all cleaned up.

94
00:04:35,800 --> 00:04:38,260
And when think you got all the pieces, you look at it like this...

95
00:04:38,260 --> 00:04:40,460
...you see another piece of glass.

96
00:04:40,460 --> 00:04:44,280
All I could smell was soy sauce.

97
00:04:44,720 --> 00:04:48,300
I thought to myself, how am I gonna eat all this sauce now?

98
00:04:48,840 --> 00:04:49,870
That doesn't really matter.

99
00:04:49,870 --> 00:04:51,640
And I'm also sweating like crazy.

100
00:04:58,470 --> 00:05:00,540
I mean, that stuff is unavoidable.

101
00:05:00,540 --> 00:05:02,600
I brought out the Quickle wiper.

102
00:05:02,720 --> 00:05:03,820
Yes, yes...

103
00:05:04,150 --> 00:05:08,380
The thing that's like, like this, you know?

104
00:05:10,780 --> 00:05:12,780
The one where your finger gets stuck.

105
00:05:14,610 --> 00:05:18,160
So I bring it out and it goes like "Quickle".

106
00:05:19,200 --> 00:05:21,580
After one wipe you have to change it already.

107
00:05:21,800 --> 00:05:23,580
It's all sticky!

108
00:05:27,580 --> 00:05:28,430
Oww oww oww!

109
00:05:29,280 --> 00:05:31,680
Learn from that will ya?

110
00:05:31,940 --> 00:05:34,080
No matter how many wipes I used, it wasn't enough.

111
00:05:35,100 --> 00:05:36,680
That stuff got me so irritated.

112
00:05:37,410 --> 00:05:38,560
It was all sticky?

113
00:05:38,130 --> 00:05:39,280
Completely sticky.

114
00:05:38,560 --> 00:05:39,280
And why was that?

115
00:05:39,280 --> 00:05:41,440
Because of the super thick soumen sauce.

116
00:05:45,930 --> 00:05:48,100
Today actually...

117
00:05:48,160 --> 00:05:50,100
...we have a special program.

118
00:05:49,370 --> 00:05:50,100
That's right.

119
00:05:51,200 --> 00:05:53,080
But before that, go ahead!

120
00:06:03,040 --> 00:06:04,660
Yama-chan isn't the type to scream this much about.

121
00:06:04,780 --> 00:06:06,000
That's not true!

122
00:06:06,040 --> 00:06:08,040
Good evening!

123
00:06:10,710 --> 00:06:13,980
During the talk from 2 weeks prior...

124
00:06:14,870 --> 00:06:16,380
So I took a little summer break.

125
00:06:17,060 --> 00:06:19,190
I decided to go to Okinawa.

126
00:06:19,190 --> 00:06:21,080
You probably don't know but...

127
00:06:21,080 --> 00:06:24,000
...do you know a kouhai named Onigiri?

128
00:06:25,730 --> 00:06:27,600
First time I've heard of that.

129
00:06:26,260 --> 00:06:27,600
Never heard of, right?

130
00:06:27,600 --> 00:06:29,490
Everyone here probably doesn't know him, either.

131
00:06:29,490 --> 00:06:32,370
So I went with Yamasaki and Miyasako.

132
00:06:32,370 --> 00:06:36,280
And Miyasako has a kouhai who he really likes, called Onigiri.

133
00:06:36,750 --> 00:06:38,280
This guy is about two meters tall.

134
00:06:39,490 --> 00:06:40,680
No, for real!

135
00:06:40,680 --> 00:06:43,180
If you tell him, "you're sweating like crazy"...

136
00:06:43,180 --> 00:06:47,300
...he's like, "this is not sweat, it's rice water".

137
00:06:49,720 --> 00:06:51,350
Nobody was laughing.

138
00:06:52,120 --> 00:06:54,580
He seemed to be good to have
around as a bodyguard...

139
00:06:54,580 --> 00:06:56,470
...so we brought him with us.

140
00:06:56,470 --> 00:06:58,970
Apparently, he used to be a volleyball player.

141
00:06:58,970 --> 00:07:02,220
He shows up with glasses on...

142
00:07:02,220 --> 00:07:05,240
...and a suit that nobody told him to bring.

143
00:07:05,240 --> 00:07:12,220
So the whole time he was talking into a radio like this, with an earpiece in.

144
00:07:13,180 --> 00:07:15,770
He'd be like "No no no!" if someone came close.

145
00:07:15,770 --> 00:07:17,680
"No picture!"

146
00:07:18,480 --> 00:07:23,040
This guy's snoring is astonishing.

147
00:07:24,280 --> 00:07:26,820
You can't even call this snoring.

148
00:07:27,190 --> 00:07:29,820
What do you mean by that?

149
00:07:27,800 --> 00:07:29,820
You're not allowed to call it snoring.

150
00:07:29,820 --> 00:07:30,740
I see now.

151
00:07:40,300 --> 00:07:41,600
Are you for real?

152
00:07:42,040 --> 00:07:43,180
That's just screaming!

153
00:07:43,440 --> 00:07:44,580
THIS IS REAL!

154
00:07:44,720 --> 00:07:48,980
Onigiri, the crazy snoring comedian.

155
00:07:49,330 --> 00:07:51,380
That's the gist of it.

156
00:07:52,230 --> 00:07:53,440
You don't know him, right?

157
00:07:53,540 --> 00:07:56,800
No idea.

158
00:07:54,160 --> 00:07:56,800
It seems the three of us don't know him.

159
00:07:56,800 --> 00:07:58,000
Never seen him either?

160
00:07:58,680 --> 00:08:02,840
The first time I heard about him was during our Okinawa trip.

161
00:08:07,900 --> 00:08:10,050
We don't really know this guy after all...

162
00:08:12,720 --> 00:08:14,280
I guess I don't know either.

163
00:08:17,720 --> 00:08:21,050
Stop making it look like I'm gonna introduce him to you all!

164
00:08:25,600 --> 00:08:27,490
He's more or less Matsumoto's favorite child.

165
00:08:28,350 --> 00:08:30,870
There's no way he's my favorite!

166
00:08:35,040 --> 00:08:36,110
Here's Onigiri!

167
00:08:46,660 --> 00:08:48,660
No picture!

168
00:08:48,660 --> 00:08:50,360
No pictures!

169
00:08:53,420 --> 00:08:55,220
Is he able to manage this on his own?

170
00:08:57,360 --> 00:09:00,060
My apologies. *fumbles over his words*

171
00:09:02,360 --> 00:09:03,800
What the hell!

172
00:09:03,940 --> 00:09:09,200
I work under Yoshimoto and I'm part of the comedy group New Romance. *more stumbling*

173
00:09:13,180 --> 00:09:16,280
Yoshimoto Industry Tokyo NSC 8th Year Manzai Combi New Romance Onigiri

174
00:09:16,600 --> 00:09:18,000
To be honest...

175
00:09:18,000 --> 00:09:24,160
...to stand on a big stage like this on your 5th year is amazing.

176
00:09:24,480 --> 00:09:28,820
You're sweating like crazy already, right?

177
00:09:27,200 --> 00:09:28,820
This is not sweat!

178
00:09:30,480 --> 00:09:34,060
It's rice water!

179
00:09:34,420 --> 00:09:36,160
See, this is what he's like.

180
00:09:40,260 --> 00:09:45,400
Over time you get used to it.

181
00:09:45,980 --> 00:09:48,880
This guy compares everything with rice.

182
00:09:49,440 --> 00:09:52,920
Why don't ask him some questions?

183
00:09:52,920 --> 00:09:55,700
How tall are you in centimeters?

184
00:09:55,700 --> 00:09:59,600
193 grains!

185
00:09:59,800 --> 00:10:01,760
See what I'm talking about?

186
00:10:04,540 --> 00:10:07,180
I mean, he did compare it to rice after all.

187
00:10:07,880 --> 00:10:11,220
How big is your shoe size?

188
00:10:11,220 --> 00:10:16,220
27.5 hectare!

189
00:10:19,640 --> 00:10:22,460
Is this compared to a rice field?

190
00:10:22,460 --> 00:10:24,200
Yes, a rice field.

191
00:10:24,520 --> 00:10:27,380
So this guy...

192
00:10:25,520 --> 00:10:27,380
Ending already?!

193
00:10:28,340 --> 00:10:31,220
It's been more than enough already!

194
00:10:31,220 --> 00:10:34,000
This guy's snoring is so amazing.

195
00:10:34,300 --> 00:10:36,860
We shared a room with five people.

196
00:10:36,860 --> 00:10:40,140
But the first two days, we had him sleep on the balcony.

197
00:10:40,140 --> 00:10:42,060
It was that loud?

198
00:10:43,060 --> 00:10:47,460
That is what we want *everybody to see today.

199
00:10:47,460 --> 00:10:49,300
You're messing up today!

200
00:10:49,560 --> 00:10:52,000
That one was really bad Zaki-san.

201
00:10:53,400 --> 00:10:58,200
Next up: Footage of the most impactful snoring made public!!

202
00:11:06,060 --> 00:11:09,260
Does snoring like this really exist in this world!?

203
00:11:10,540 --> 00:11:15,540
The person in question: the young comedian, Onigiri.

204
00:11:14,400 --> 00:11:15,540
Good morning!

205
00:11:16,300 --> 00:11:21,320
The truth about Onigiri's snoring.

206
00:11:24,290 --> 00:11:28,820
Onigiri, born in Hokkaido, July 1977.

207
00:11:25,000 --> 00:11:27,080
From here?!

208
00:11:30,200 --> 00:11:33,300
With his 185 cm father...

209
00:11:33,300 --> 00:11:36,300
...and his 175 cm mother...

210
00:11:36,300 --> 00:11:40,900
...Onigiri was always a tall kid, who kept on growing.

211
00:11:41,800 --> 00:11:46,760
After graduating middle school, he was already 188cm tall.

212
00:11:46,760 --> 00:11:49,060
With his physique, he worked hard to become like a certain person.

213
00:11:49,840 --> 00:11:54,200
I wanted to become a volleyball player like Nakagaichi.

214
00:11:55,400 --> 00:11:56,900
Yes, volleyball!

215
00:11:58,260 --> 00:12:01,830
With dreams of becoming a pro, he gave it his all during his youth.

216
00:12:02,030 --> 00:12:11,800
He entered Nippon Steel, famous for the volleyball team.

217
00:12:13,400 --> 00:12:15,060
Working and playing volleyball....

218
00:12:15,060 --> 00:12:20,120
...he achieved his dream and was able to meet his hero shoulder to shoulder.

219
00:12:21,500 --> 00:12:25,980
So why did he quit volleyball to instead become a comedian?

220
00:12:26,400 --> 00:12:32,920
Nakagaichi's payslip had fallen in the gym.

221
00:12:32,920 --> 00:12:40,600
I ended up looking at it and the pay wasn't that great so I decided to quit.

222
00:12:38,200 --> 00:12:40,600
You can't do that!

223
00:12:41,700 --> 00:12:43,300
I'm terribly sorry.

224
00:12:45,100 --> 00:12:50,660
Doubts of Onigiri's snoring started to surface.

225
00:12:51,200 --> 00:12:54,820
That's why this time, we decided to record his sleeping at home.

226
00:12:55,600 --> 00:12:59,600
With four cameras set up, we'll wait for Onigiri to come home.

227
00:13:13,160 --> 00:13:15,160
What's up with
that tiny futon?

228
00:13:20,240 --> 00:13:22,320
Thank you for your hard work! Thank you!

229
00:13:22,320 --> 00:13:24,480
I'll be sleeping now. Sorry and good night!

230
00:13:25,800 --> 00:13:27,800
You don't have
to apologize.

231
00:13:31,600 --> 00:13:33,840
Late night, a bit past 1 am.

232
00:13:33,840 --> 00:13:38,680
After a day of work, Onigiri goes to sleep like usual.

233
00:13:38,680 --> 00:13:42,000
What will see from here on out!?

234
00:13:42,420 --> 00:13:44,420
*5 minutes later*

235
00:13:43,700 --> 00:13:46,740
Is this the first
time you've seen
yourself sleep?

236
00:13:45,160 --> 00:13:46,740
Yes, this is
the first time.

237
00:13:53,400 --> 00:13:55,400
*10 minutes later*

238
00:13:56,600 --> 00:14:03,200
Onigiri starts snoring little by little.

239
00:14:04,280 --> 00:14:06,280
*20 minutes later*

240
00:14:10,060 --> 00:14:13,000
This still seems
fairly normal.

241
00:14:15,580 --> 00:14:17,580
*30 minutes later*

242
00:14:29,160 --> 00:14:31,260
What's this?

243
00:14:31,260 --> 00:14:33,260
What the hell
is this?

244
00:14:41,500 --> 00:14:43,200
It's not like he's
sleep-talking.

245
00:14:44,700 --> 00:14:50,480
Paired with a peculiar voice, he starts to make small shaking movements.

246
00:14:58,340 --> 00:15:00,680
*45 minutes later*

247
00:14:59,820 --> 00:15:02,820
He's laughing!

248
00:15:06,540 --> 00:15:08,540
For real,
what is this?

249
00:15:32,300 --> 00:15:34,300
He's a monster,
right?!

250
00:15:39,740 --> 00:15:44,900
We found a reason for his peculiar snoring.

251
00:15:45,290 --> 00:15:46,760
You're screaming!

252
00:15:45,840 --> 00:16:00,840
1: First it starts with sleep apnea.

253
00:15:54,140 --> 00:15:56,140
I can't help but
look at the earplug

254
00:16:00,840 --> 00:16:08,320
2: Gasping for air.

255
00:16:06,480 --> 00:16:08,480
What the hell
is this?!

256
00:16:14,160 --> 00:16:17,300
3: Followed by peculiar snoring.

257
00:16:14,460 --> 00:16:16,460
This is bad.

258
00:16:18,380 --> 00:16:22,080
What is the volume of the strange snoring?

259
00:16:29,640 --> 00:16:31,640
I told you it
was for real!

260
00:16:30,280 --> 00:16:32,900
The highest snoring measured was a whopping 94.0 dB.

261
00:16:34,660 --> 00:16:39,580
This same volume occurs when a train crosses a steel bridge.

262
00:16:40,680 --> 00:16:44,680
Just before dawn, the snoring still continues.

263
00:16:43,260 --> 00:16:44,680
This is crazy!

264
00:16:47,700 --> 00:16:49,700
How long do
you keep going?

265
00:16:51,640 --> 00:16:53,940
For real, how
long do you
keep going for?

266
00:17:07,260 --> 00:17:10,740
Onigiri-san, good morning.

267
00:17:20,480 --> 00:17:22,480
We'll be heading out now.

268
00:17:23,840 --> 00:17:27,240
May I sleep like I usually do now?

269
00:17:37,240 --> 00:17:41,820
Onigiri's strange snoring continues...

270
00:17:39,100 --> 00:17:41,820
That was amazing.

271
00:17:46,400 --> 00:17:48,660
That wasn't really snoring.

272
00:17:48,660 --> 00:17:50,560
You're screaming!

273
00:17:50,820 --> 00:17:54,320
You've never seen something like this before right?

274
00:17:53,000 --> 00:17:54,320
Never!

275
00:17:57,580 --> 00:18:00,580
You started moving like this as well.

276
00:18:01,200 --> 00:18:03,280
That was gross!

277
00:18:06,680 --> 00:18:10,820
See! Going on a trip with this guy can't be fun right?

278
00:18:10,820 --> 00:18:13,660
I had a lot of fun!

279
00:18:13,660 --> 00:18:14,820
Probably, yeah.

280
00:18:14,820 --> 00:18:18,720
During that, are you having dreams?

281
00:18:19,440 --> 00:18:21,080
Not in particular.

282
00:18:21,300 --> 00:18:23,840
You don't sleep bad either?

283
00:18:22,900 --> 00:18:26,080
Not really...

284
00:18:23,840 --> 00:18:27,220
You sleep very well?

285
00:18:26,080 --> 00:18:27,220
Yes, I do.

286
00:18:27,800 --> 00:18:30,080
Aren't you tired when you wake up?

287
00:18:30,080 --> 00:18:32,400
No, I feel super refreshed.

288
00:18:32,620 --> 00:18:34,120
You feel refreshed?

289
00:18:34,920 --> 00:18:38,080
If you were his girlfriend, you'd probably be scared.

290
00:18:38,280 --> 00:18:40,400
Don't you have one?

291
00:18:40,400 --> 00:18:43,800
I'm currently taking applications!

292
00:18:43,800 --> 00:18:46,360
I shouldn't have asked...

293
00:18:47,920 --> 00:18:51,160
I'll say this: he's very bad at this kinda stuff.

294
00:18:52,600 --> 00:18:55,240
So this footage has been submitted to a specialist.

295
00:18:55,240 --> 00:18:56,900
Let's hear what they say about this.

296
00:18:59,240 --> 00:19:01,480
Onigiri's snoring sounds like an animal.

297
00:19:02,100 --> 00:19:05,400
What does a specialist have to say about this?

298
00:19:03,080 --> 00:19:04,800
He's laughing!

299
00:19:04,800 --> 00:19:07,300
When a specialist
is laughing you
know it's bad!

300
00:19:05,840 --> 00:19:11,600
This is the first time I've seen a video of someone sleeping this poorly.

301
00:19:11,600 --> 00:19:13,560
It's scary,
honestly!

302
00:19:14,160 --> 00:19:17,700
From what I can see, due to his corpulent physique...

303
00:19:17,700 --> 00:19:24,160
...it makes him unable to breath, causing sleep apnea.

304
00:19:24,160 --> 00:19:30,760
Over the long term, this will have negative effects on his heart, brain and blood vessels...

305
00:19:31,000 --> 00:19:39,660
...as well as the dangers of arteriosclerosis, heart attacks and strokes.

306
00:19:39,840 --> 00:19:43,960
I would highly recommend seeking professional help...

307
00:19:43,960 --> 00:19:48,660
...to find the causes and to treat the issue.

308
00:19:49,480 --> 00:19:55,060
Go to the hospital and get an examination done quick!

309
00:19:55,400 --> 00:19:57,400
What the hell?!

310
00:19:58,860 --> 00:20:00,860
No way you're sleeping!

311
00:20:01,540 --> 00:20:05,140
But it seems like you were telling the truth after all.

312
00:20:03,540 --> 00:20:05,140
I was!

313
00:20:05,140 --> 00:20:07,060
That was abnormal.

314
00:20:09,320 --> 00:20:11,740
That was the end, but could we please see it one more time?

315
00:20:11,740 --> 00:20:13,120
I want to see it again too.

316
00:20:13,120 --> 00:20:16,600
Because of the laughing I couldn't hear all of it.

317
00:20:16,880 --> 00:20:19,000
This is very precious footage.

318
00:20:19,000 --> 00:20:22,600
More precious than footage of eels laying eggs.

319
00:20:23,360 --> 00:20:25,400
Let's watch this precious footage again.

320
00:20:33,600 --> 00:20:36,400
This is on the
verge of still
being acceptable.

321
00:20:36,400 --> 00:20:38,800
You'd almost think
he's doing this
on purpose.

322
00:20:46,160 --> 00:20:49,600
This is kinda
gross, I don't
like it!

323
00:21:06,200 --> 00:21:08,700
It's like an engine
starting up.

324
00:21:30,600 --> 00:21:32,600
This is way
too long.

325
00:21:55,440 --> 00:21:57,440
He's saying something.

326
00:22:03,300 --> 00:22:05,360
What do you think after seeing this?

327
00:22:05,400 --> 00:22:11,240
I'm sorry for any trouble I have caused.

328
00:22:11,320 --> 00:22:13,100
Such a normal response!

329
00:22:13,100 --> 00:22:14,800
The normalest of the normal!

330
00:22:14,800 --> 00:22:16,880
Didn't you compare everything to rice?

331
00:22:16,880 --> 00:22:18,320
Stop crying!

332
00:22:19,500 --> 00:22:21,480
I'm not crying!

333
00:22:20,680 --> 00:22:21,480
Oh really?

334
00:22:21,480 --> 00:22:25,240
I got rice in my eyes.

335
00:22:24,100 --> 00:22:25,240
Aren't you an onigiri?

336
00:22:28,100 --> 00:22:30,600
Now it looks like I bombed too.

337
00:22:32,860 --> 00:22:35,000
After all of this you'll be a grilled onigiri.

338
00:22:35,200 --> 00:22:38,700
Next up: Onigiri's special move!!

339
00:22:39,600 --> 00:22:45,240
Would it be okay if I told you about his special move?

340
00:22:45,400 --> 00:22:47,800
He used to play volleyball so...

341
00:22:47,800 --> 00:22:53,460
...his backslap is nothing to joke about.

342
00:22:55,360 --> 00:22:59,060
Sorry, then I would like...

343
00:23:02,680 --> 00:23:05,240
You're crazy, absolutely crazy!

344
00:23:05,240 --> 00:23:07,640
I really don't want that!

345
00:23:07,640 --> 00:23:09,240
That's just crazy!

346
00:23:09,240 --> 00:23:11,840
Yama-chan hurry up already...

347
00:23:10,160 --> 00:23:11,840
No, please wait!

348
00:23:12,120 --> 00:23:13,220
Sorry!

349
00:23:16,540 --> 00:23:19,360
Angela Aki should go!

350
00:23:17,680 --> 00:23:19,360
I'm not Angela Aki!

351
00:23:22,520 --> 00:23:24,080
Wait, this is impossible!

352
00:23:24,080 --> 00:23:27,400
Hold on, you're the one who told us about it!

353
00:23:27,400 --> 00:23:31,780
He's your favorite child after all!

354
00:23:31,780 --> 00:23:34,000
He's not my favorite!

355
00:23:34,000 --> 00:23:36,900
Could you do it on this chair then?

356
00:23:42,080 --> 00:23:44,840
A slap from this height coming down...

357
00:23:45,000 --> 00:23:47,080
You're sitting?

358
00:23:51,400 --> 00:23:53,400
