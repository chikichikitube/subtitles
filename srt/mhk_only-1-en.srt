1
00:00:02,520 --> 00:00:13,530
"Only" - The commercial shooting, filming and audio were to be recorded separately.

2
00:00:02,650 --> 00:00:04,660
Ok, that's a wrap!

3
00:00:04,660 --> 00:00:08,360
Good job, thank you everyone!

4
00:00:08,460 --> 00:00:11,630
To the guard, Kyutarou-san and to Mentor Suzuki Hirome-san

5
00:00:11,630 --> 00:00:13,600
Good job both of you, thank you very much!

6
00:00:15,270 --> 00:00:19,400
And Hamada Masatoshi-san, good job, thank you!

7
00:00:17,100 --> 00:00:19,400
- Ah, thanks, good job.

8
00:00:21,270 --> 00:00:24,210
Hamada-san, you did it on first try, thank you very much!

9
00:00:24,210 --> 00:00:26,580
We'll have a cast party, if you'd like to...

10
00:00:26,580 --> 00:00:29,750
Ah, sorry but I was planning on going back to Osaka...

11
00:00:28,480 --> 00:00:29,750
- Of course, no problem!

12
00:00:29,750 --> 00:00:31,380
Wait! Wait! Wait!

13
00:00:31,380 --> 00:00:32,180
Wait up!

14
00:00:34,950 --> 00:00:36,020
What is going on?

15
00:00:36,850 --> 00:00:37,920
It's not over yet!

16
00:00:38,390 --> 00:00:39,390
It's not?

17
00:00:39,390 --> 00:00:41,030
We haven't recorded the audio yet!

18
00:00:42,960 --> 00:00:44,030
I'm very sorry!

19
00:00:45,400 --> 00:00:47,670
Come on! Don't screw up, you fool!

20
00:00:48,200 --> 00:00:49,070
What now?

21
00:00:49,570 --> 00:00:50,870
Let's record "Only", I'm very sorry!

22
00:00:50,870 --> 00:00:51,670
It's ok.

23
00:00:51,500 --> 00:00:53,700
It's the last thing left to do and we're done.

24
00:00:54,740 --> 00:00:55,840
What were you thinking?

25
00:00:55,840 --> 00:00:56,940
Sorry! Let's record "Only"!

26
00:00:56,610 --> 00:00:58,040
Then let's-

27
00:00:56,940 --> 00:00:59,640
You have to put your soul when doing these things, you fool!

28
00:01:00,380 --> 00:01:02,150
Let's record-

29
00:01:00,980 --> 00:01:03,610
You first wear the helmet and then you get on the bike, you fool!

30
00:01:04,420 --> 00:01:06,050
Ok then, let's-

31
00:01:04,820 --> 00:01:06,980
If you would buy a TV,

32
00:01:06,980 --> 00:01:09,350
you'd place it in the corner of the room, you fool!

33
00:01:09,350 --> 00:01:10,490
What were you thinking?

34
00:01:10,850 --> 00:01:12,360
I'm very sorry, really.

35
00:01:12,360 --> 00:01:13,690
Is it ok if we do this?

36
00:01:13,690 --> 00:01:15,160
I was going to Osaka-

37
00:01:14,530 --> 00:01:17,130
It's just that if we only don't record the "Only" ad, it won't

38
00:01:17,130 --> 00:01:19,860
feel like we've completely have finished it, you see?

39
00:01:20,400 --> 00:01:21,670
I see, I see.
- I'm really really sorry.

40
00:01:22,070 --> 00:01:23,470
- No problem at all.

41
00:01:23,700 --> 00:01:26,370
Are you... Are you angry?

42
00:01:25,070 --> 00:01:26,370
No, not at all!

43
00:01:26,370 --> 00:01:28,110
When I see you on TV, you seem a little scary...

44
00:01:28,110 --> 00:01:29,610
I think "Is he really like that"?

45
00:01:29,610 --> 00:01:30,810
No, not at all...

46
00:01:30,540 --> 00:01:31,910
Is it really ok then?

47
00:01:31,010 --> 00:01:31,910
Really, don't worry.

48
00:01:31,910 --> 00:01:33,040
You can remove the wig if you want.

49
00:01:33,040 --> 00:01:34,080
Ah, may I?

50
00:01:34,080 --> 00:01:35,650
We'll only need to record the voice

51
00:01:35,650 --> 00:01:36,610
Ok, got it.

52
00:01:36,610 --> 00:01:38,150
Ok, let's do this everyone...

53
00:01:38,150 --> 00:01:39,850
LET'S RECORD "ONLY"!!

54
00:01:39,850 --> 00:01:41,320
Pay attention, please.

55
00:01:42,650 --> 00:01:43,390
Is this ok?

56
00:01:43,390 --> 00:01:44,520
Yes, we'll record with this.

57
00:01:45,820 --> 00:01:47,560
So, Hamada-san, I'll queue you the lines

58
00:01:47,560 --> 00:01:49,930
And after I queue, then please repeat the lines.

59
00:01:49,930 --> 00:01:50,860
Ok, understood.

60
00:01:50,860 --> 00:01:51,800
Let's see...

61
00:01:51,800 --> 00:01:53,200
"Jumbo Cup Noodles"

62
00:01:53,200 --> 00:01:56,200
It's the product we have so that's your line

63
00:01:56,200 --> 00:01:57,970
So say it once for us, please.

64
00:01:58,470 --> 00:01:59,500
Understood.

65
00:01:59,840 --> 00:02:01,010
Are we ready?

66
00:02:01,010 --> 00:02:02,970
We're ready to go, ok, ok.

67
00:02:08,850 --> 00:02:10,610
Jumbo Cup Noodles!

68
00:02:16,520 --> 00:02:17,590
That's was great.

69
00:02:17,590 --> 00:02:18,360
Thank you very much.

70
00:02:18,360 --> 00:02:19,560
No, you put your felling into it.

71
00:02:19,560 --> 00:02:20,520
Thank you, thank you.

72
00:02:20,520 --> 00:02:22,990
That was amazing... I hope it's not weird to say this...

73
00:02:22,990 --> 00:02:23,660
It's ok, it's ok.

74
00:02:23,660 --> 00:02:25,130
The volume of your voice was perfect.

75
00:02:25,130 --> 00:02:26,660
Oh no, come on. I'm just-

76
00:02:26,660 --> 00:02:27,700
Thank you very much.

77
00:02:27,700 --> 00:02:29,770
Can you do it again? "Jumbo Cup Noodles"

78
00:02:30,570 --> 00:02:31,870
One more time?

79
00:02:35,110 --> 00:02:36,540
Jumbo Cup Noodles!

80
00:02:42,450 --> 00:02:46,750
I just... I heard some sound from outside. Watch it!

81
00:02:46,750 --> 00:02:48,790
Like... A helicopter, see if there's one nearby, please!

82
00:02:48,790 --> 00:02:50,020
A copter...

83
00:02:50,020 --> 00:02:51,260
There's a helicopter flying off!

84
00:02:51,260 --> 00:02:52,590
It's ok, here-

85
00:02:51,990 --> 00:02:54,430
Do you guys hear the helicopter flying?

86
00:02:55,830 --> 00:02:57,060
Isn't it flying?

87
00:02:56,530 --> 00:02:57,590
It's not-

88
00:02:57,060 --> 00:02:58,800
I'm sure I heard it flying so...

89
00:02:58,360 --> 00:03:00,160
But it's fine here in the studio.

90
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:03,300
It gets on my nerves, I know I shouldn't worry about this...

91
00:03:04,770 --> 00:03:06,570
It's difficult, Hamada-san.

92
00:03:07,340 --> 00:03:08,670
My heart races...

93
00:03:08,670 --> 00:03:10,670
It's ok, don't worry. Let's continue.

94
00:03:10,670 --> 00:03:12,110
Let's go with "Jumbo Cup Noodles"

95
00:03:12,110 --> 00:03:13,510
What? One more time?

96
00:03:17,110 --> 00:03:18,520
Jumbo Cup Noodles!

97
00:03:30,230 --> 00:03:31,560
That was great.

98
00:03:31,560 --> 00:03:34,000
That was really great, full of energy.

99
00:03:36,900 --> 00:03:38,200
Let's see...

100
00:03:38,200 --> 00:03:41,040
"Chicken flavor stock now available"

101
00:03:43,240 --> 00:03:44,940
"Chicken flavor stock now available"

102
00:03:44,940 --> 00:03:47,110
The chicken flavor stock came out recently.

103
00:03:47,110 --> 00:03:49,210
It's very popular.

104
00:03:49,210 --> 00:03:50,810
I want to make sure we show that.

105
00:03:50,810 --> 00:03:52,320
I see.

106
00:03:51,280 --> 00:03:52,320
- Let's go.

107
00:04:00,020 --> 00:04:01,990
"Chicken flavor stock now available"

108
00:04:06,700 --> 00:04:08,000
Thank you very much.

109
00:04:08,500 --> 00:04:11,370
Now, let's see...

110
00:04:11,370 --> 00:04:13,900
"Mini chicken stock now available"

111
00:04:13,900 --> 00:04:15,140
Let's try it, please.

112
00:04:15,170 --> 00:04:17,710
"Mini chicken stock now available"

113
00:04:20,180 --> 00:04:22,710
Mini chicken stock now available

114
00:04:24,950 --> 00:04:26,650
Let's try going faster.

115
00:04:26,950 --> 00:04:30,050
"Mini chicken stock now available, furthermore, the grainy type!"

116
00:04:32,060 --> 00:04:33,620
Grainy type, right?

117
00:04:35,960 --> 00:04:39,630
"Mini chicken stock now available, furthermore, the grainy type!"

118
00:04:39,630 --> 00:04:40,800
Good, good!

119
00:04:40,800 --> 00:04:41,600
Thank you.

120
00:04:41,600 --> 00:04:43,700
Just... This is kind of an experiment but...

121
00:04:44,000 --> 00:04:46,100
Could you try "It's grainy type!"

122
00:04:47,940 --> 00:04:49,340
"It's grainy type."

123
00:04:49,340 --> 00:04:51,210
"It's grainy type!" let's go with that.

124
00:04:51,210 --> 00:04:52,380
How should I?

125
00:04:52,380 --> 00:04:54,240
Say "It's grainy type...!"

126
00:04:54,240 --> 00:04:55,580
Like "How nice!"

127
00:04:55,580 --> 00:04:57,680
"Ah! It's the grainy type!", like that.

128
00:04:59,380 --> 00:05:00,720
Ok...

129
00:05:01,220 --> 00:05:02,390
When you're ready.

130
00:05:04,420 --> 00:05:05,890
It's the grainy type!

131
00:05:07,720 --> 00:05:09,190
"It's that grainy type!"

132
00:05:09,630 --> 00:05:11,090
It's that grainy type!

133
00:05:11,330 --> 00:05:14,000
"The grainy type... of grains available now!"

134
00:05:14,300 --> 00:05:15,970
The grainy type of grains available now!

135
00:05:15,970 --> 00:05:17,370
"Shochu grain of grains available now!"

136
00:05:17,370 --> 00:05:18,570
Shochu grain of grains available now!

137
00:05:18,570 --> 00:05:20,870
"Available nooow!"

138
00:05:19,700 --> 00:05:21,310
Available nooow!

139
00:05:21,310 --> 00:05:23,170
That was great!

140
00:05:23,170 --> 00:05:24,940
Try to make it more lively

141
00:05:24,940 --> 00:05:26,240
"Available noooow!"

142
00:05:26,240 --> 00:05:28,080
More lively.

143
00:05:28,080 --> 00:05:29,810
"Available now", right?

144
00:05:30,180 --> 00:05:32,050
Available nooow!

145
00:05:32,050 --> 00:05:33,450
Ah, nice!

146
00:05:33,450 --> 00:05:35,450
Now, "Curry flavor available now."

147
00:05:35,450 --> 00:05:36,850
Curry flavor?

148
00:05:36,850 --> 00:05:38,990
It was released, yes.

149
00:05:38,990 --> 00:05:40,590
Let's try it once.

150
00:05:40,590 --> 00:05:43,160
But... is that correct? The product-

151
00:05:43,160 --> 00:05:45,330
It's ok, the curry flavor will also be released.

152
00:05:45,330 --> 00:05:48,900
It's not being produced yet, but I'd
like to record it all at once so...

153
00:05:48,900 --> 00:05:50,870
Hamada-san, please don't...

154
00:05:50,870 --> 00:05:53,070
The curry flavor will be released... So please let's try it.

155
00:05:58,380 --> 00:05:59,980
Curry flavor available now.

156
00:06:04,720 --> 00:06:06,320
Curry flavor available now.

157
00:06:07,480 --> 00:06:09,120
Don't, don't do that. It overlapped.

158
00:06:09,120 --> 00:06:10,550
Once was enough.

159
00:06:12,060 --> 00:06:13,990
You did... this "come on" movement...

160
00:06:13,990 --> 00:06:15,460
No, no problem.

161
00:06:15,460 --> 00:06:17,430
It felt like you wanted one more.

162
00:06:17,430 --> 00:06:19,030
No, no, that's scary.

163
00:06:19,030 --> 00:06:21,300
It felt like you wanted it again...

164
00:06:21,300 --> 00:06:22,500
I'm sorry, I'm sorry.

165
00:06:22,500 --> 00:06:24,070
I screwed up.

166
00:06:24,470 --> 00:06:25,870
Please do your best!

167
00:06:30,570 --> 00:06:31,880
Curry flavor available now!

168
00:06:31,880 --> 00:06:34,380
Say it to the microphone!

169
00:06:32,680 --> 00:06:34,380
Ah, sorry, sorry.

170
00:06:35,950 --> 00:06:37,250
Curry flavor available now!

171
00:06:44,890 --> 00:06:46,190
That was great, Hamada-san.

172
00:06:47,060 --> 00:06:51,500
Now, "Curry flavor available, also with 30 percent more!"

173
00:06:52,430 --> 00:06:54,770
It's a bit long, but...

174
00:06:53,130 --> 00:06:54,770
- A bit.

175
00:06:54,770 --> 00:06:56,470
Sorry, let's give it a try.

176
00:06:55,800 --> 00:06:57,370
"Curry flavor available, also..."

177
00:06:57,370 --> 00:07:00,770
It's "Curry flavor available, also with 30 percent more!"

178
00:07:02,010 --> 00:07:05,180
Just... be quiet over there! There is some sound coming in.

179
00:07:05,180 --> 00:07:06,540
Is everything fine?

180
00:07:06,540 --> 00:07:08,350
We're recording here!

181
00:07:08,910 --> 00:07:10,180
PAY ATTENTION!

182
00:07:11,580 --> 00:07:12,850
So, Hamada-san, do it.

183
00:07:15,850 --> 00:07:19,560
Curry flavor available, also with 30 percent more.

184
00:07:19,560 --> 00:07:21,090
Too long, Hamada-san!

185
00:07:21,090 --> 00:07:23,360
Try to keep it three seconds long, it'd be nice.

186
00:07:23,630 --> 00:07:25,030
Three seconds...

187
00:07:24,330 --> 00:07:26,530
Try to make it more lively.

188
00:07:26,530 --> 00:07:29,270
Hamada-san, what's wrong? You were odd, right now.

189
00:07:29,270 --> 00:07:31,170
Let's try again, more lively.

190
00:07:32,170 --> 00:07:34,070
Curry flavor available, also-

191
00:07:32,970 --> 00:07:34,670
SHUT UP OVER THERE!

192
00:07:35,440 --> 00:07:37,140
WHAT ARE YOU DOING?

193
00:07:37,370 --> 00:07:39,710
Hamada-san is recording! Hamada-san!

194
00:07:39,710 --> 00:07:40,580
Yes...

195
00:07:40,580 --> 00:07:42,050
Do it right!

196
00:07:43,210 --> 00:07:46,680
From the 30 percent part, try to do it manlier.

197
00:07:46,680 --> 00:07:48,020
Do your best.

198
00:07:48,650 --> 00:07:51,150
Curry flavor-

199
00:07:49,150 --> 00:07:51,150
Wait! Wait for the queue!

200
00:07:51,150 --> 00:07:53,390
You haven't been waiting the queue lately.

201
00:07:57,260 --> 00:08:00,600
Curry flavor available, also with 30 percent more!

202
00:08:07,800 --> 00:08:09,710
That was great, Hamada-san.

203
00:08:11,680 --> 00:08:13,140
Aren't we done?

204
00:08:13,140 --> 00:08:14,540
Just, just a little more.

205
00:08:14,540 --> 00:08:17,910
"How much spicier can it be?", if you would, please.

206
00:08:17,910 --> 00:08:21,050
You see, curry flavor is spicy so...

207
00:08:21,050 --> 00:08:23,350
By saying "How spicier can it be?"

208
00:08:23,350 --> 00:08:26,660
We're trying think like an entertainer from Kansai would.

209
00:08:26,760 --> 00:08:28,290
Hama-chan.

210
00:08:29,230 --> 00:08:30,590
Please do it.

211
00:08:32,860 --> 00:08:34,900
How much spicier can it get?

212
00:08:36,900 --> 00:08:39,770
Now... "Spicy like that even I can fucking eat it!"

213
00:08:41,770 --> 00:08:44,370
"Spicy like that even I can fucking eat it!", please.

214
00:08:44,610 --> 00:08:45,780
Is that ok?

215
00:08:45,780 --> 00:08:49,410
Try to be energetic this time, we want to make it sound like

216
00:08:49,410 --> 00:08:51,780
"Spicy like that even I can fucking eat it!"

217
00:08:54,020 --> 00:08:55,820
Spicy like that even I can fucking eat it!

218
00:08:56,350 --> 00:08:58,420
Nice, nice. Let's try the next.

219
00:08:58,420 --> 00:09:01,890
"That's freaking spicy, I've never fucking eaten anything like this!"

220
00:09:05,900 --> 00:09:07,300
How was it...?

221
00:09:08,170 --> 00:09:10,170
"Spicy like that even I can fucking eat it!"

222
00:09:10,170 --> 00:09:12,170
"I've never fucking eaten anything like this!"

223
00:09:12,170 --> 00:09:14,070
Say "Fucking eaten" twice, please.

224
00:09:16,240 --> 00:09:17,910
Spicy like that even I can fucking eat it...

225
00:09:17,910 --> 00:09:20,180
I've never fucking eaten anything like this!

226
00:09:20,910 --> 00:09:22,180
Fucking eaten!

227
00:09:22,810 --> 00:09:25,020
That kind of lost energy in the end, Hamada-san.

228
00:09:25,020 --> 00:09:26,450
It was fine.

229
00:09:26,450 --> 00:09:29,020
Doesn't it feel like... We're not evolving right?

230
00:09:29,020 --> 00:09:30,720
No, it's fine, it's fine.

231
00:09:30,720 --> 00:09:32,920
Since I don't have much time,

232
00:09:32,920 --> 00:09:35,090
I'd like if we could hurry up a bit.

233
00:09:35,090 --> 00:09:37,060
What do you mean by that?

234
00:09:37,990 --> 00:09:39,230
Do them all at once.

235
00:09:39,230 --> 00:09:42,800
How many lines are there yet?

236
00:09:42,800 --> 00:09:44,500
Around forty ofr fifty.

237
00:09:44,500 --> 00:09:46,470
There's not that much!

238
00:09:46,870 --> 00:09:48,740
There is not that much.

239
00:09:48,740 --> 00:09:49,770
No?

240
00:09:50,140 --> 00:09:52,010
It can't be that much, we can't do that much.

241
00:09:52,680 --> 00:09:56,450
If we don't finish in an hour, that's it.

242
00:09:56,450 --> 00:09:59,680
But it'll be a challenge to go fast like that,

243
00:09:59,680 --> 00:10:02,190
I might need to comment sometimes.

244
00:10:02,190 --> 00:10:05,320
Yes, but if we go fast... We-

245
00:10:05,320 --> 00:10:08,260
What, you want to go from last to first then?

246
00:10:08,730 --> 00:10:10,190
Which do you want?

247
00:10:10,660 --> 00:10:13,060
Yes, well... The one from before

248
00:10:13,060 --> 00:10:15,700
The regular flavor, I'd like to do it.

249
00:10:16,000 --> 00:10:17,770
The regular one, right?

250
00:10:18,570 --> 00:10:19,800
It' not relevant right now, right?

251
00:10:19,800 --> 00:10:22,040
I feel like right now...

252
00:10:22,040 --> 00:10:23,710
It's not relevant right now?

253
00:10:24,840 --> 00:10:26,510
It's not relevant right now?

254
00:10:27,410 --> 00:10:29,710
For this commercial, it's not relevant, right?

255
00:10:29,710 --> 00:10:32,620
The curry flavor and the grain type.

256
00:10:32,620 --> 00:10:34,120
I don't know but...

257
00:10:36,650 --> 00:10:39,860
The grain type special release is near.

258
00:10:40,460 --> 00:10:42,460
Sure but it wasn't even made yet, right?

259
00:10:42,460 --> 00:10:44,660
No, not yet. It's still in development.

260
00:10:44,660 --> 00:10:46,160
In development?

261
00:10:46,900 --> 00:10:48,200
So we didn't need those lines?

262
00:10:48,400 --> 00:10:49,400
No good?

263
00:10:49,700 --> 00:10:50,970
That's weird...

264
00:10:50,970 --> 00:10:51,870
Why is that?

265
00:10:51,870 --> 00:10:53,840
"That's weird!" let's record that one.

266
00:10:56,070 --> 00:10:58,580
Go, Hamada-san. Let's record "That's weird!"

267
00:11:01,480 --> 00:11:02,710
That's weird!

268
00:11:04,780 --> 00:11:08,080
Hamada-san your laughter. It got recorded. What is wrong?

269
00:11:08,080 --> 00:11:09,550
It's weird... That..

270
00:11:09,550 --> 00:11:12,760
"Let's record it once, That's weird!"

271
00:11:12,760 --> 00:11:14,420
When Hamada-san said that line

272
00:11:14,420 --> 00:11:15,960
I felt we could save it for later

273
00:11:15,960 --> 00:11:17,190
Because it was really good.

274
00:11:17,190 --> 00:11:18,630
It felt real.

275
00:11:18,630 --> 00:11:20,600
And it's what I want.

276
00:11:21,260 --> 00:11:22,400
Short like that was fine?

277
00:11:22,400 --> 00:11:23,400
It was fine.

278
00:11:23,670 --> 00:11:25,270
So will you use it then?

279
00:11:25,270 --> 00:11:26,300
We will not.

280
00:11:28,940 --> 00:11:31,940
Even if we don't use, it's still worth something!

281
00:11:32,110 --> 00:11:33,940
If Hamada-san don't want to...

282
00:11:33,940 --> 00:11:35,650
Can I call you Hama-chan?

283
00:11:35,310 --> 00:11:36,880
What?

284
00:11:35,650 --> 00:11:37,180
Hama-chan, you see.

285
00:11:37,180 --> 00:11:38,450
You see...

286
00:11:38,450 --> 00:11:40,120
You're creating a weird atmosphere.

287
00:11:39,820 --> 00:11:41,050
- No, I'm not.

288
00:11:41,050 --> 00:11:42,290
Let's just record it.

289
00:11:42,290 --> 00:11:43,650
You are the one being weird.

290
00:11:43,650 --> 00:11:44,520
Why is that?

291
00:11:45,020 --> 00:11:47,790
You made me say that line even if you won't use it.

292
00:11:47,790 --> 00:11:49,160
We're out of time!

293
00:11:49,330 --> 00:11:50,390
Out of time?

294
00:11:50,390 --> 00:11:51,660
Let's do it, then.

295
00:11:51,660 --> 00:11:53,460
It has nothing to do with the product, we're late.

296
00:11:53,460 --> 00:11:54,660
It doesn't, does it?

297
00:11:55,070 --> 00:11:56,270
Will you use it or not?

298
00:11:56,270 --> 00:11:58,370
Will yes don't use-

299
00:11:57,000 --> 00:11:58,370
- What?

300
00:11:59,570 --> 00:12:00,600
We will.

301
00:12:02,840 --> 00:12:04,110
WHAT IS IT?

302
00:12:05,740 --> 00:12:07,180
Hamada-san...

303
00:12:07,180 --> 00:12:09,710
Please, come on Hamada-san!

304
00:12:07,780 --> 00:12:09,750
- What is your problem?

305
00:12:12,150 --> 00:12:13,480
What the hell is your problem?

306
00:12:13,480 --> 00:12:14,750
What is it, Hamada-san?

307
00:12:15,650 --> 00:12:16,990
What is your problem?

308
00:12:17,550 --> 00:12:19,160
What is it, Hamada-san?

309
00:12:21,630 --> 00:12:24,160
Please, come on Hamada-san

310
00:12:22,960 --> 00:12:24,930
- Don't do that!

311
00:12:24,930 --> 00:12:26,630
Don't be annoying.

312
00:12:26,630 --> 00:12:28,700
What is it, Hamada-san...

313
00:12:27,200 --> 00:12:28,700
- Don't do that!

314
00:12:30,200 --> 00:12:31,700
What is it, Hamada-san?

315
00:12:31,700 --> 00:12:35,340
Hurry up already! What are you doing, stupid?

316
00:12:36,210 --> 00:12:37,570
"Win a hugging pillow!"

317
00:12:37,570 --> 00:12:39,010
We are freaking late.

318
00:12:39,010 --> 00:12:41,080
"Win a hugging pillow!"

319
00:12:39,780 --> 00:12:41,080
- Win a hugging pillow.

320
00:12:43,680 --> 00:12:46,020
Hamada-san... "Win a hugging pillow!"

321
00:12:46,020 --> 00:12:47,420
Win a hugging pillow.

322
00:12:48,720 --> 00:12:50,050
Just said it.

323
00:12:50,050 --> 00:12:52,590
But that... It won't work for the ad...

324
00:12:53,020 --> 00:12:55,030
I'll say it then you repeat, ok?

325
00:12:55,030 --> 00:12:56,690
Ok, ok, let's go.

326
00:12:56,860 --> 00:12:58,160
"Win a hugging pillow!"

327
00:12:58,160 --> 00:12:59,700
Win a hugging pillow!

328
00:13:00,600 --> 00:13:02,270
"Win a curry hugging pillow!"

329
00:13:03,400 --> 00:13:04,970
Win a curry hugging pillow!

330
00:13:04,970 --> 00:13:07,600
"Enter a curry hugging pillow winning spree!"

331
00:13:08,540 --> 00:13:10,610
Enter a curry hugging pillow winning spree!

332
00:13:10,610 --> 00:13:13,440
"Only people who have a curry hugging pillow can win!"

333
00:13:14,280 --> 00:13:15,280
Only-

334
00:13:15,280 --> 00:13:16,510
Wait, isn't that strange?

335
00:13:16,510 --> 00:13:17,250
Why?

336
00:13:18,980 --> 00:13:21,280
You need one to win?

337
00:13:21,280 --> 00:13:22,250
That's it.

338
00:13:22,250 --> 00:13:24,120
You can't know if this person has one or not.

339
00:13:24,120 --> 00:13:27,360
It what is says here, that kind of information will come to us.

340
00:13:27,390 --> 00:13:30,530
It's fine. Hamada-san, don't worry about it.

341
00:13:30,530 --> 00:13:34,500
But I'm here to the ad and I have no idea of what we're doing.

342
00:13:34,500 --> 00:13:37,000
We've thought this through, so don't worry.

343
00:13:37,570 --> 00:13:40,270
"Only people who have a curry hugging pillow can win!"

344
00:13:40,600 --> 00:13:43,440
Only people who have a curry hugging pillow can win!

345
00:13:43,440 --> 00:13:45,610
"A curry hugging pillow has been won!"

346
00:13:47,710 --> 00:13:50,080
A curry hugging pillow has been won!

347
00:13:52,050 --> 00:13:54,350
What was that I had to say?

348
00:13:55,220 --> 00:13:56,920
What did I just had to say?

349
00:13:56,920 --> 00:13:58,090
What?

350
00:13:58,090 --> 00:14:00,420
That... "Has been won!", what was that?

351
00:14:00,420 --> 00:14:04,430
Ah that... It was won before... One time.

352
00:14:04,430 --> 00:14:05,560
By who?

353
00:14:06,960 --> 00:14:08,500
A consumer.

354
00:14:10,300 --> 00:14:12,470
Don't worry about that, Hamada-san.

355
00:14:14,940 --> 00:14:18,410
I don't see Hamada-san merit anymore...

356
00:14:18,410 --> 00:14:20,940
...This was supposed to be faster.

357
00:14:20,940 --> 00:14:22,410
I'm sorry.

358
00:14:22,410 --> 00:14:24,550
"Win a curry hugging gorilla!"

359
00:14:25,680 --> 00:14:27,320
Win a curry hugging gorilla!

360
00:14:27,750 --> 00:14:29,550
"The curry hugging gorilla roars!"

361
00:14:35,960 --> 00:14:38,360
"The curry hugging...  gorilla roars!"

362
00:14:39,560 --> 00:14:44,070
"We're out of curry hugging gorillas, win a curry hugging mole!"

363
00:14:45,870 --> 00:14:49,410
We're out of curry hugging gorillas, win a curry hugging mole!

364
00:14:50,040 --> 00:14:56,250
"I won a curry hugging mole along with other people
who missed it, I want to win a curry hugging gorilla!"

365
00:14:56,250 --> 00:14:57,810
What the hell are you saying?

366
00:14:59,720 --> 00:15:01,250
Please let's do it.

367
00:15:04,520 --> 00:15:05,720
This one?

368
00:15:07,060 --> 00:15:12,700
"I won a curry hugging mole along with other people
who missed it, I want to win a curry hugging gorilla!"

369
00:15:16,070 --> 00:15:21,070
I won a curry hugging mole along with other people
who missed it, I want to win a curry hugging gorilla!

370
00:15:24,940 --> 00:15:26,880
Hamada-san, thank you very much!

371
00:15:30,280 --> 00:15:32,620
Please wait a moment! Please wait!

372
00:15:33,350 --> 00:15:36,320
Boss... With all the respect...

373
00:15:36,320 --> 00:15:38,460
Instead of curry flavor, duck flavor would be the best!

374
00:15:39,520 --> 00:15:41,120
You! What are you doing?

375
00:15:41,120 --> 00:15:43,430
The curry flavor was boss's idea!

376
00:15:43,430 --> 00:15:45,300
I know that, but...

377
00:15:45,300 --> 00:15:47,700
That spicy taste, it would be better with duck flavor.

378
00:15:47,700 --> 00:15:48,900
Stop saying-

379
00:15:48,900 --> 00:15:50,670
Wait, wait a moment.

380
00:15:51,970 --> 00:15:53,500
What is your name?

381
00:15:54,370 --> 00:15:56,670
I work for Nishiya, my name is Sekiya.

382
00:15:57,970 --> 00:16:01,680
That was not what we had agreed upon, was it?

383
00:16:02,280 --> 00:16:04,010
We're very sorry!!

384
00:16:04,010 --> 00:16:06,180
I will take care of everything!

385
00:16:06,980 --> 00:16:09,490
Jumbo Cup Noodles...

386
00:16:09,490 --> 00:16:11,720
...new flavor...

387
00:16:14,260 --> 00:16:16,090
let's change it to Duck flavor!

388
00:16:16,860 --> 00:16:18,160
Boss!!

389
00:16:18,930 --> 00:16:21,260
It's been a while since I last saw that happen.

390
00:16:22,200 --> 00:16:24,370
Your name was Sekiya, right?

391
00:16:24,370 --> 00:16:25,170
Yes!

392
00:16:25,170 --> 00:16:26,270
Congratulations!

393
00:16:26,800 --> 00:16:28,270
Thank you very much!!

394
00:16:37,210 --> 00:16:38,650
Everybody, thank you!

395
00:16:40,880 --> 00:16:42,320
Let's go with Duck flavor!!

396
00:16:43,350 --> 00:16:44,750
Yeah! Let's go!

397
00:16:44,750 --> 00:16:46,660
Hamada-san, excuse-me.

398
00:16:46,660 --> 00:16:48,360
Please sit down.

399
00:16:48,360 --> 00:16:50,360
Hamada-san, one more time...

400
00:16:50,790 --> 00:16:53,630
"We're out of duck hugging gorillas, win a duck hugging mole!"

401
00:16:53,630 --> 00:16:55,300
Let's do it.

402
00:16:56,170 --> 00:16:57,870
The only difference is "duck".

403
00:16:59,070 --> 00:17:00,270
Is "duck" fine?

404
00:17:00,270 --> 00:17:02,070
Yes, "Duck hugging gorilla..."

405
00:17:02,070 --> 00:17:04,340
Let's do them all at once.

406
00:17:04,340 --> 00:17:05,980
So you can go home....

407
00:17:05,980 --> 00:17:09,610
From "Win a duck hugging pillow!", say them all at once.

408
00:17:10,310 --> 00:17:12,350
What?
