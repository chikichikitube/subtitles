1
00:00:24,060 --> 00:00:27,350
What kind of comedian suits Documental?

2
00:00:27,350 --> 00:00:39,350
Well, for example, comedians like Shirai, who can strike the fatal blow on his own

3
00:00:39,350 --> 00:00:50,100
*Uchima is a contestant of the experimental Documental Season 0

4
00:00:39,350 --> 00:00:50,100
Contrarily, comedians that are never suitable for Documental would be those like Uchima*

5
00:00:52,060 --> 00:00:53,410
No way!

6
00:00:53,410 --> 00:00:54,340
How come?

7
00:00:54,340 --> 00:00:56,600
No way, why is Nobu here?

8
00:00:56,600 --> 00:01:01,610
That being said, Uchima actually turned out to be interesting, you know what I mean?

9
00:01:01,610 --> 00:01:05,270
I'm not talking bad about Uchima

10
00:01:05,270 --> 00:01:09,260
Uchima appears interesting if we think about it again now

11
00:01:09,260 --> 00:01:14,770
So we can see that Owarai is really
a profound matter with many layers

12
00:01:20,570 --> 00:01:22,530
This can't be true

13
00:02:29,580 --> 00:02:32,740
Your beard will be stained with milk

14
00:02:32,740 --> 00:02:34,630
No it won't be stained

15
00:02:34,630 --> 00:02:36,160
Try to drink it then

16
00:02:36,160 --> 00:02:37,970
Chug it

17
00:02:39,150 --> 00:02:41,240
That's fast

18
00:02:41,240 --> 00:02:43,480
It's stained dude

19
00:02:43,940 --> 00:02:47,490
You are the one who asked him to do it

20
00:02:47,490 --> 00:02:49,720
Daigo, yellow!

21
00:02:49,720 --> 00:02:50,840
Yes, I understand

22
00:02:50,840 --> 00:02:53,620
Kurosawa, what happened?

23
00:02:53,920 --> 00:02:55,570
What happened?

24
00:02:57,410 --> 00:02:59,830
How come?

25
00:02:59,830 --> 00:03:01,150
Seriously, what happened?

26
00:03:01,150 --> 00:03:03,240
It's truly a male‐dominated society

27
00:03:04,310 --> 00:03:05,750
A male‐dominated society...

28
00:03:05,750 --> 00:03:06,840
It's fine, don't worry

29
00:03:06,840 --> 00:03:09,970
Don't worry, everything will be fine

30
00:03:20,010 --> 00:03:20,750
Here it starts

31
00:03:20,750 --> 00:03:23,400
-It started?
-Yes, it started

32
00:03:23,400 --> 00:03:24,890
He's being so nice to her

33
00:03:24,890 --> 00:03:27,930
-Yeah, you've gone too far
-I bet they did it

34
00:03:27,930 --> 00:03:29,320
Why don't you just leave her alone?

35
00:03:29,320 --> 00:03:30,900
No, I did nothing

36
00:03:30,900 --> 00:03:34,230
But you were being nice to her right?

37
00:03:34,230 --> 00:03:35,430
You did it?

38
00:03:35,430 --> 00:03:38,270
No I didn't, I'm not being nice to her because we did it

39
00:03:38,270 --> 00:03:39,660
Did it? What do you mean did it?

40
00:03:39,660 --> 00:03:40,770
You mean they had sex?

41
00:03:40,770 --> 00:03:43,510
Because he started saying we did it. Of course we didn't

42
00:03:43,510 --> 00:03:45,070
Say something Kurosawa

43
00:03:45,070 --> 00:03:46,680
We did it

44
00:03:50,170 --> 00:03:53,050
With Fujimon?

45
00:03:53,050 --> 00:03:54,450
Wait, Kurosawa...

46
00:03:54,450 --> 00:03:55,390
You did it?

47
00:03:55,390 --> 00:03:57,590
We didn't dude, why are you lying

48
00:03:57,590 --> 00:03:59,320
She's a bit moody now, please excuse her

49
00:03:59,320 --> 00:04:00,660
Who did you do it with?

50
00:04:00,660 --> 00:04:03,000
Fujimon-san

51
00:04:03,000 --> 00:04:05,950
-He did it?
-Yes

52
00:04:05,950 --> 00:04:08,260
Come on, Fujimon-san, that's unacceptable

53
00:04:08,260 --> 00:04:10,330
How dare you put your hands on your juniors

54
00:04:10,330 --> 00:04:12,480
That's incest

55
00:04:12,480 --> 00:04:14,150
When did he do it?

56
00:04:14,150 --> 00:04:15,690
In 1998

57
00:04:15,690 --> 00:04:17,990
That was long time ago

58
00:04:17,990 --> 00:04:20,280
-Right after you made your debut?
-Yes

59
00:04:20,280 --> 00:04:23,260
No I didn't, why are you lying about this? You're being weird

60
00:04:23,260 --> 00:04:25,180
-Where did he do it?
-Drink some tea

61
00:04:25,180 --> 00:04:25,840
Where?

62
00:04:25,840 --> 00:04:28,190
The basement of Tameike-sanno

63
00:04:25,840 --> 00:04:40,400
*Kurosawa and Fujimon are both employed by Yoshimoto, which was located in Tameike-sanno back in 1998

64
00:04:28,190 --> 00:04:29,160
Minato-ku?

65
00:04:29,160 --> 00:04:31,220
Where Yoshimoto was located previously

66
00:04:31,220 --> 00:04:32,860
Before he got married?

67
00:04:32,860 --> 00:04:33,580
At the basement?

68
00:04:33,580 --> 00:04:35,520
That's where Yoshimoto was based right?

69
00:04:35,520 --> 00:04:37,110
Yes, the former Yoshimoto base

70
00:04:37,110 --> 00:04:39,580
So he did it after work right?

71
00:04:39,580 --> 00:04:40,400
Yes

72
00:04:40,400 --> 00:04:46,110
Did he do it because of love, or did he abuse his power as a senior? This is a crucial difference.

73
00:04:46,110 --> 00:04:48,680
I didn't do it dude, why are you saying it like I did it?

74
00:04:48,680 --> 00:04:50,640
What was the sex position?

75
00:04:50,640 --> 00:04:52,740
What's that called again...

76
00:04:52,740 --> 00:04:57,420
His face is over here, and his sex organ is on my face

77
00:04:57,420 --> 00:04:58,810
So it didn't go in then

78
00:04:58,810 --> 00:05:01,520
It can be conveyed by numbers right?

79
00:05:01,520 --> 00:05:04,060
An even number and an odd number?

80
00:05:04,060 --> 00:05:05,660
Even number and odd number right?

81
00:05:05,660 --> 00:05:08,760
-Show us how it looks like
-Yeah, try it out

82
00:05:08,760 --> 00:05:10,960
So I'm going to do 69 with Kurosawa now?

83
00:05:11,900 --> 00:05:18,650
-Because we don't know what kind of position is that
-Just reproduce the situation and show us how it looks like

84
00:05:18,650 --> 00:05:19,580
Who was on the top?

85
00:05:19,580 --> 00:05:21,930
Kurosawa do you remember who was on the top?

86
00:05:21,930 --> 00:05:23,190
He was at the side

87
00:05:23,190 --> 00:05:24,400
At the side?

88
00:05:24,400 --> 00:05:27,050
That's innovative

89
00:05:27,050 --> 00:05:28,450
Is that even possible?

90
00:05:28,450 --> 00:05:30,780
-So Kurosawa you're in this position?
-Yes

91
00:05:30,780 --> 00:05:32,520
Oh, I see what you mean

92
00:05:32,520 --> 00:05:33,630
What do you mean?

93
00:05:33,630 --> 00:05:37,940
So you did it from behind right...?

94
00:05:37,940 --> 00:05:40,250
He put his face in my butt

95
00:05:40,250 --> 00:05:41,650
(It's lacking a decisive moment)

96
00:05:41,650 --> 00:05:42,830
That's not a 69 then

97
00:05:42,830 --> 00:05:47,300
-Just try it out
-But that's not a 69

98
00:05:47,300 --> 00:05:49,600
What is this called? 69?

99
00:05:49,600 --> 00:05:50,880
Put your face here

100
00:05:50,880 --> 00:05:53,820
You didn't touch me though

101
00:05:53,820 --> 00:05:56,670
-He didn't touch you?
-Yes, he didn't

102
00:05:56,670 --> 00:05:59,870
His nose is in my butt

103
00:05:59,870 --> 00:06:00,990
-It went in?
-Yes

104
00:06:00,990 --> 00:06:03,820
-Fujimon said he wants to do it in this position?
-Yes

105
00:06:03,820 --> 00:06:05,970
That's not how you have sex

106
00:06:05,970 --> 00:06:07,550
-His nose went in?
-Yes

107
00:06:07,550 --> 00:06:10,270
-His nose went in smoothly?
-Yes

108
00:06:10,270 --> 00:06:12,570
Not like that, your nose went further

109
00:06:12,570 --> 00:06:15,030
It went further?

110
00:06:15,430 --> 00:06:16,670
Ah, just like that

111
00:06:16,670 --> 00:06:17,940
It went in?

112
00:06:17,940 --> 00:06:20,100
Yes, just like that

113
00:06:20,100 --> 00:06:22,480
Why are you speaking like Henna Oji-san?

114
00:06:20,100 --> 00:06:28,470
*Henna Oji-san is a famed original character by Ken Shimura

115
00:06:22,480 --> 00:06:23,920
Ah, just like that

116
00:06:23,920 --> 00:06:26,310
-Ah, just like that
-That's Shimura-san

117
00:06:26,310 --> 00:06:28,470
Why are you speaking like Henna Oji-san?

118
00:06:28,470 --> 00:06:32,440
-Did he ask you to act Shimura-san during the play?
-Ah, yes he did

119
00:06:32,440 --> 00:06:33,990
-Kurosawa you're fine with this right?
-Yes

120
00:06:33,990 --> 00:06:37,010
I'll do it then...

121
00:06:37,200 --> 00:06:39,000
Ah, just like that

122
00:06:43,150 --> 00:06:45,470
Sometimes you say it, and sometimes you don't right?

123
00:06:45,470 --> 00:06:46,400
Why is that?

124
00:06:46,400 --> 00:06:47,800
You missed the spot isn't it?

125
00:06:47,800 --> 00:06:49,350
Can I try it again?

126
00:06:49,350 --> 00:06:51,160
I'll do it again now

127
00:06:51,430 --> 00:06:52,330
No, that's wrong

128
00:06:52,330 --> 00:06:53,970
That's too strong

129
00:06:53,970 --> 00:06:54,740
That's still too strong

130
00:06:54,740 --> 00:06:57,850
You didn't use too much force before

131
00:06:57,850 --> 00:06:59,900
-Do it smoothly
-Yeah, do it tenderly

132
00:06:59,900 --> 00:07:01,860
-Be tender
-Put it in smoothly

133
00:07:02,620 --> 00:07:04,540
Are you using greasepaint?

134
00:07:05,490 --> 00:07:08,030
Yes, I am

135
00:07:08,030 --> 00:07:10,270
Come on, her pants will be stained

136
00:07:10,270 --> 00:07:12,570
That's no good, Fujimon-san

137
00:07:12,570 --> 00:07:14,980
Don't stain female's pants with greasepaint

138
00:07:14,980 --> 00:07:17,020
So in the end, they didn't have sex right?

139
00:07:17,020 --> 00:07:17,550
Yes

140
00:07:17,550 --> 00:07:21,840
-Yes, we didn't
-Only the nose

141
00:07:21,840 --> 00:07:24,430
Only the nose went in, so that doesn't count

142
00:07:24,430 --> 00:07:26,970
Can you stop checking your pants here?

143
00:07:26,970 --> 00:07:28,380
We can see your underwear

144
00:07:28,380 --> 00:07:30,320
But I'm wearing two underwear

145
00:07:30,320 --> 00:07:32,700
Stop, girls shouldn't do that

146
00:07:33,300 --> 00:07:34,360
What's under your pants?

147
00:07:34,360 --> 00:07:35,100
Double underwear

148
00:07:35,100 --> 00:07:38,040
One is a normal underwear, and the other one is a boxer short

149
00:07:38,040 --> 00:07:40,630
-Your underwear looks like concrete
-Yeah

150
00:07:40,630 --> 00:07:42,260
Like granite

151
00:07:42,260 --> 00:07:43,420
Yeah, the gray one

152
00:07:43,420 --> 00:07:45,490
Kitagi island has a lot of granite too

153
00:07:45,490 --> 00:07:46,770
That's irrelevant dude

154
00:07:46,770 --> 00:07:49,660
-That's the island where I lived
-That's irrelevant

155
00:07:49,660 --> 00:07:50,590
We don't need that info

156
00:07:50,590 --> 00:07:54,030
And your dad collects round stones right?

157
00:07:54,030 --> 00:08:04,120
My dad goes to the seaside, and collect perfectly round stones without any corners at the beach

158
00:08:04,120 --> 00:08:06,270
And show it to the boss of the island

159
00:08:06,270 --> 00:08:07,790
What is the boss of the island?

160
00:08:07,790 --> 00:08:09,490
The island's boss

161
00:08:09,490 --> 00:08:10,860
You call him the island's boss?

162
00:08:10,860 --> 00:08:13,500
My dad calls him the boss

163
00:08:13,500 --> 00:08:15,600
Yeah, but he's not being employed

164
00:08:15,600 --> 00:08:16,650
Like the don of the island

165
00:08:16,650 --> 00:08:19,250
So like the authorities

166
00:08:19,250 --> 00:08:26,230
And show them the stones like
"Boss, here is the perfectly round stone"

167
00:08:26,230 --> 00:08:30,600
Will the boss pay for it?

168
00:08:30,600 --> 00:08:31,630
Yes, a little bit

169
00:08:31,630 --> 00:08:32,130
How much?

170
00:08:32,130 --> 00:08:33,040
5000 yen

171
00:08:36,300 --> 00:08:39,280
So this is how you were raised

172
00:08:39,280 --> 00:08:40,160
By round stones...

173
00:08:40,160 --> 00:08:42,140
Is it 5000 yen per stone?

174
00:08:42,140 --> 00:08:44,910
If it's not perfectly rounded, it won't get paid

175
00:08:44,910 --> 00:08:48,410
-So the more rounded it is, the more expensive it is
-Yeah, of course

176
00:08:49,290 --> 00:08:51,510
The more rounded it is, the more expensive it is

177
00:08:51,510 --> 00:08:53,940
So is the boss collecting round stones?

178
00:08:53,940 --> 00:08:56,920
The island's boss is the owner of a stone company

179
00:08:56,920 --> 00:09:01,030
You need say that first, otherwise we won't understand

180
00:09:01,030 --> 00:09:03,190
What are they using the round stones for?

181
00:09:03,190 --> 00:09:04,860
Well, probably just to look at it

182
00:09:04,860 --> 00:09:05,720
Look at it?

183
00:09:05,720 --> 00:09:08,370
So the women boss is collecting stones just to look at it?

184
00:09:08,370 --> 00:09:10,000
Not a women boss though

185
00:09:10,000 --> 00:09:12,960
Oh, it's not? Sorry, I thought the boss is female

186
00:09:12,960 --> 00:09:15,450
-90 percent of bosses are males right?
-Is it?

187
00:09:15,450 --> 00:09:18,030
No way, that's gender discrimination

188
00:09:18,030 --> 00:09:21,520
Not discrimination, but did you ever heard of a women boss?

189
00:09:21,520 --> 00:09:23,610
Yes, sometimes

190
00:09:23,610 --> 00:09:25,380
Yeah, think about Wonder Woman

191
00:09:25,380 --> 00:09:27,860
Wonder Woman is not relevant to this at all

192
00:09:30,050 --> 00:09:32,680
This is really impressive

193
00:09:30,050 --> 00:09:39,770
*Impressive and souvenir have the same pronunciation

194
00:09:32,680 --> 00:09:33,400
Yeah, it's interesting

195
00:09:33,400 --> 00:09:37,220
-Who you buying those souvenirs for?
-Shinagawa-ku

196
00:09:37,220 --> 00:09:38,930
Where my home is

197
00:09:38,930 --> 00:09:39,770
Souvenirs

198
00:09:39,770 --> 00:09:41,100
No one else buy souvenirs?

199
00:09:41,100 --> 00:09:42,590
Well, I do buy souvenirs though

200
00:09:42,590 --> 00:09:44,370
Are you guys good at buying souvenirs?

201
00:09:44,370 --> 00:09:46,200
Like when you're filming outdoors?

202
00:09:46,200 --> 00:09:49,160
-What does good at buying souvenir means?
-Like the sense of buying souvenirs

203
00:09:49,160 --> 00:09:50,750
I see, well...

204
00:09:50,750 --> 00:09:54,510
I'm the type of person who buys a lot of delicacies and end up throwing them out

205
00:09:54,510 --> 00:09:56,850
-I see, so they went stale
-Yes

206
00:09:56,850 --> 00:09:58,950
-It's hard to hold back
-Exactly, I love it

207
00:09:58,950 --> 00:10:02,290
And there's a lot of these edible chili oil nowadays

208
00:10:02,290 --> 00:10:06,490
I threw out 2 or 3 of them already

209
00:10:06,490 --> 00:10:09,940
Because it's spicy, so I always thought it will never go stale

210
00:10:09,940 --> 00:10:11,400
-Yeah, exactly
-You're right

211
00:10:11,400 --> 00:10:14,130
-There's edible chili oil?
-Yeah, there is

212
00:10:14,130 --> 00:10:16,220
It's really popular now

213
00:10:16,220 --> 00:10:18,010
You can buy it at Pengin Shokudo

214
00:10:18,010 --> 00:10:20,710
*Nara is a pun from the previous episode

215
00:10:18,010 --> 00:10:20,710
What the heck is Pengin Shokudo nara?

216
00:10:20,710 --> 00:10:22,320
Pengin Shokudo

217
00:10:22,320 --> 00:10:23,970
There's throwable Shumai too

218
00:10:28,600 --> 00:10:30,670
What are you doing?

219
00:10:30,670 --> 00:10:32,990
That's terrible

220
00:10:32,990 --> 00:10:35,120
You asked for it

221
00:10:35,120 --> 00:10:37,660
Are you joking?

222
00:10:37,660 --> 00:10:40,100
-I tried to hold back
-Are you serious?

223
00:10:40,100 --> 00:10:43,030
-Dude, stop messing with me?
-What did I do?

224
00:10:43,960 --> 00:10:45,410
It's cunning to pinpoint me

225
00:10:45,410 --> 00:10:47,900
That's because you were asking me

226
00:10:47,900 --> 00:10:49,860
What just happened?

227
00:10:49,860 --> 00:10:53,600
We were talking about edible chili oil, and he said there's throwable Shumai as well

228
00:10:56,540 --> 00:11:01,020
I just imagined how you throw a Shumai like this

229
00:11:01,020 --> 00:11:04,410
-I can't help but imagine that
-Yeah, you made him imagine that

230
00:11:04,410 --> 00:11:07,720
I understand your feelings, but that was terrible

231
00:11:07,720 --> 00:11:10,620
You went like "ge-hey-hey-hey"

232
00:11:10,870 --> 00:11:12,720
Come on, I'm so weak

233
00:11:13,420 --> 00:11:15,280
-There's edible chili oil?
-Yeah, there is

234
00:11:15,280 --> 00:11:16,450
It's really popular now

235
00:11:16,450 --> 00:11:17,730
Oh, really?

236
00:11:18,570 --> 00:11:20,490
-You can buy it at Pengin Shokudo
-Yeah

237
00:11:20,500 --> 00:11:22,480
*Nara is a pun from the previous episode

238
00:11:20,500 --> 00:11:22,480
What the heck is Pengin Shokudo nara?

239
00:11:22,480 --> 00:11:24,610
(He actually tried to attack here)

240
00:11:24,610 --> 00:11:26,460
There's throwable Shumai too

241
00:11:31,040 --> 00:11:32,940
He tried to muddle through by smoking

242
00:11:32,940 --> 00:11:34,660
But he couldn't make it

243
00:11:34,660 --> 00:11:36,320
But I didn't laugh out loud right?

244
00:11:36,320 --> 00:11:38,780
Well, umm...

245
00:11:38,780 --> 00:11:40,280
Well, yeah but still...

246
00:11:40,280 --> 00:11:41,420
Sorry

247
00:11:41,420 --> 00:11:43,660
This is fast

248
00:11:43,660 --> 00:11:46,270
-This is fast
-Yeah, this is fast

249
00:11:46,270 --> 00:11:47,480
Just in 30 minutes...

250
00:11:47,480 --> 00:11:50,280
-There's still 5 and a half hours left
-Oh god, seriously?

251
00:11:50,280 --> 00:11:52,600
Are we even going to make it through guys?

252
00:11:52,600 --> 00:11:54,950
-He'll always come out if he becomes a zombie
-Yes, exactly

253
00:11:54,950 --> 00:11:57,990
Yeah, it's fearful to make him a zombie

254
00:11:57,990 --> 00:12:00,820
The earlier he loses, the more he'll come out, and that's frightening

255
00:12:00,820 --> 00:12:03,310
Don't make him a zombie please

256
00:12:03,310 --> 00:12:05,450
Yeah, I should have been more considerate

257
00:12:09,740 --> 00:12:11,550
Let's start

258
00:12:14,100 --> 00:12:16,910
Even if I play it cool, it's meaningless if I'm out

259
00:12:16,910 --> 00:12:19,180
There's this chicken that screams like "quack" right?

260
00:12:19,180 --> 00:12:22,880
-Let's play with that
-That sounds interesting

261
00:12:26,420 --> 00:12:27,690
What's a chicken that screams?

262
00:12:27,690 --> 00:12:29,330
You squeeze it and it goes "quack"

263
00:12:29,330 --> 00:12:32,040
-Ah, the one that looks like a wild turkey
-Yes

264
00:12:32,040 --> 00:12:35,780
Kurochan put back the milk bottle slowly just now

265
00:12:35,780 --> 00:12:37,610
You don't need to talk about that

266
00:12:37,610 --> 00:12:38,770
No, I don't remember that

267
00:12:40,820 --> 00:12:41,840
Ah, I saw that before

268
00:12:41,840 --> 00:12:46,110
This comes out in the United States Navy's enlistment test

269
00:12:46,110 --> 00:12:48,240
Eh? What kind of test is that?

270
00:12:48,240 --> 00:12:49,220
To not laugh at this

271
00:12:49,220 --> 00:12:52,500
You need to hold back your laughter while it screams in your ear

272
00:12:52,500 --> 00:12:55,230
No one will laugh at this though

273
00:12:55,230 --> 00:12:57,750
What if I squeeze it while standing up

274
00:13:00,920 --> 00:13:02,720
What the heck was that

275
00:13:05,450 --> 00:13:07,200
Fujimon, can you give me a shout?

276
00:13:07,200 --> 00:13:09,240
Can everyone come over here?

277
00:13:09,240 --> 00:13:12,210
Yeah, we should watch this together

278
00:13:12,210 --> 00:13:14,910
Ask me to turn around and see if you guys can hold back

279
00:13:16,110 --> 00:13:17,720
-Of course we can hold back
-Yeah

280
00:13:17,720 --> 00:13:19,770
We watched this many times already

281
00:13:21,300 --> 00:13:22,530
-Are you ready?
-Yes

282
00:13:22,530 --> 00:13:23,540
Miyasako-san

283
00:13:23,540 --> 00:13:25,120
What's up?

284
00:13:25,780 --> 00:13:28,690
-Let it scream dude
-It's not screaming

285
00:13:33,440 --> 00:13:35,660
Nah, this is not going to work

286
00:13:35,660 --> 00:13:37,750
Anyone want to try this?

287
00:13:37,750 --> 00:13:39,070
Nishizawa

288
00:13:39,070 --> 00:13:41,100
Nishizawa can you do this?

289
00:13:41,100 --> 00:13:42,480
Nishizawa do it at the front

290
00:13:42,480 --> 00:13:44,630
Nishizawa-kun's face looks hilarious

291
00:13:44,630 --> 00:13:47,380
Don't let Nishizawa do it dude

292
00:13:47,380 --> 00:13:51,190
I never did this before though

293
00:13:51,190 --> 00:13:54,500
Hey, look at him

294
00:13:54,500 --> 00:13:56,820
Damn it, damn it

295
00:13:59,080 --> 00:14:00,230
Should I give you a shout?

296
00:14:03,220 --> 00:14:04,960
Should I kill him, dude

297
00:14:04,960 --> 00:14:06,420
Can you give me a shout please?

298
00:14:06,420 --> 00:14:08,280
-Do it after he gives you a shout
-Sorry

299
00:14:11,710 --> 00:14:13,330
Hey, no dude

300
00:14:15,990 --> 00:14:19,120
No, Nishizawa, turn around after I give you a shout

301
00:14:19,120 --> 00:14:19,900
I got it

302
00:14:24,470 --> 00:14:25,120
No, no dude

303
00:14:26,590 --> 00:14:27,960
There's a lot more

304
00:14:27,960 --> 00:14:29,690
-A lot?
-Yeah I brought a lot

305
00:14:29,690 --> 00:14:30,980
-Why though?
-A lot?

306
00:14:30,980 --> 00:14:32,570
Wait a moment

307
00:14:33,810 --> 00:14:35,260
-And can you...
-Yes?

308
00:14:40,220 --> 00:14:43,420
They all sound a bit different

309
00:14:43,420 --> 00:14:44,320
That's a lot

310
00:14:44,320 --> 00:14:46,630
-That's too much
-Are they all the same?

311
00:14:46,630 --> 00:14:48,870
-What happens if you squeeze them all at a time?
-Let's try

312
00:14:53,250 --> 00:14:55,800
-That's amazing
-Yeah, that's amazing

313
00:14:55,800 --> 00:14:57,650
Daigo laughed right?

314
00:14:59,080 --> 00:15:01,090
-What happened?
-Who laughed?

315
00:15:01,090 --> 00:15:03,490
-Who laughed?
-Who is it?

316
00:15:03,490 --> 00:15:05,350
-Is it you Daigo?
-It's Daigo

317
00:15:05,350 --> 00:15:06,300
No, no way

318
00:15:06,300 --> 00:15:07,610
No way, that shouldn't count

319
00:15:07,610 --> 00:15:09,050
That shouldn't count as laughing

320
00:15:09,050 --> 00:15:11,190
-You're yellow carded already right?
-Eh, really?

321
00:15:11,190 --> 00:15:12,720
Yeah, Daigo is yellow carded

322
00:15:12,720 --> 00:15:15,210
Eh, wait a second, did I even laughed just now?

323
00:15:15,210 --> 00:15:16,830
No, I didn't laugh, no

324
00:15:16,830 --> 00:15:18,800
-Who laughed?
-Who is it?

325
00:15:18,800 --> 00:15:20,480
Eh, at this time?

326
00:15:20,480 --> 00:15:24,040
-That's too fast
-That's really fast

327
00:15:24,040 --> 00:15:25,930
Daigo...

328
00:15:25,930 --> 00:15:27,940
Let's have a look

329
00:15:27,940 --> 00:15:28,740
Eh...

330
00:15:28,740 --> 00:15:29,670
Let's have a look first

331
00:15:29,670 --> 00:15:33,520
I'm not really sure about this too

332
00:15:33,520 --> 00:15:35,330
It's so sad if Daigo is out

333
00:15:43,650 --> 00:15:46,630
-Does that count?
-That's absolutely laughing

334
00:15:46,630 --> 00:15:49,200
I have to give you an orange card for this

335
00:15:49,200 --> 00:15:51,050
-You actually should be out
-Yes

336
00:15:51,050 --> 00:15:54,500
You should be red carded after a yellow card

337
00:15:54,500 --> 00:15:56,690
-Yes
-That's how it works right?

338
00:15:56,690 --> 00:15:58,500
-Get ready
-Okay

339
00:15:58,500 --> 00:16:00,250
Stop it, it's sticking in my mind

340
00:16:00,250 --> 00:16:01,870
Please let me calm down first

341
00:16:01,870 --> 00:16:03,660
Please don't play with that for now

342
00:16:03,660 --> 00:16:06,470
What's going on with him?

343
00:16:06,470 --> 00:16:08,990
Daigo is so weak

344
00:16:10,020 --> 00:16:11,660
He's so weak right?

345
00:16:11,660 --> 00:16:13,490
Come on

346
00:16:18,220 --> 00:16:19,560
Let's start

347
00:16:21,260 --> 00:16:22,900
Here it starts again

348
00:16:22,900 --> 00:16:25,200
-Let's calm down first
-Yeah

349
00:16:25,200 --> 00:16:26,870
The pace is too fast

350
00:16:26,870 --> 00:16:28,000
Is this fast?

351
00:16:28,000 --> 00:16:29,870
Yeah, it's really fast

352
00:16:29,870 --> 00:16:32,720
Daigo will already be out next time

353
00:16:32,720 --> 00:16:36,420
-Yeah, I'll be out next...
-You'll be out even if you just laugh a little bit

354
00:16:36,420 --> 00:16:37,510
That's alarming

355
00:16:37,510 --> 00:16:40,450
-Let me squeeze this first
-Stop that

356
00:16:40,450 --> 00:16:43,250
Listen, they scream differently

357
00:16:43,250 --> 00:16:46,200
Come on, stop that

358
00:16:46,200 --> 00:16:48,970
Are you the hero who saved them?

359
00:16:51,340 --> 00:16:53,320
Why are you holding so many of them

360
00:16:53,320 --> 00:16:55,900
And look at his biceps

361
00:16:55,900 --> 00:17:00,310
It becomes brawny when he squeezes them

362
00:17:00,940 --> 00:17:04,830
He looks like a frightened kangaroo right?

363
00:17:06,100 --> 00:17:07,810
I told you not to hold too many

364
00:17:08,500 --> 00:17:09,650
Hey dude

365
00:17:09,650 --> 00:17:11,780
-Are you cosplaying?
-What?

366
00:17:11,780 --> 00:17:13,360
Aren't you cosplaying?

367
00:17:13,360 --> 00:17:14,480
You changed your clothes?

368
00:17:14,480 --> 00:17:15,820
No, I didn't

369
00:17:15,820 --> 00:17:16,860
Who is he cosplaying?

370
00:17:16,860 --> 00:17:19,690
The staffs at Kariyushi Urban Resort

371
00:17:19,690 --> 00:17:24,280
The hotel at Okinawa, Kariyushi Urban Resort

372
00:17:24,280 --> 00:17:25,750
You're cosplaying them right?

373
00:17:25,750 --> 00:17:27,360
-No, I'm not
-Oh, you're not

374
00:17:27,360 --> 00:17:29,950
-You stayed in that hotel before?
-Yes

375
00:17:29,950 --> 00:17:32,330
It's a good hotel

376
00:17:34,000 --> 00:17:37,060
That scared me

377
00:17:37,060 --> 00:17:39,730
That scared me, I thought it's a buzzer

378
00:17:39,730 --> 00:17:40,550
Do I look like them?

379
00:17:40,550 --> 00:17:42,940
Exactly the same, check out how they look

380
00:17:42,940 --> 00:17:44,290
You look exactly the same

381
00:17:44,290 --> 00:17:45,840
This is fast

382
00:17:45,840 --> 00:17:47,980
Yeah, it is

383
00:17:47,980 --> 00:17:50,710
Because it's a Shinkansen

384
00:17:50,710 --> 00:17:52,290
And Shikansen is...?

385
00:17:52,290 --> 00:17:53,990
FAST

386
00:17:53,990 --> 00:17:55,470
-You're annoying
-That scared me

387
00:17:55,470 --> 00:17:56,620
Who will even laugh at that?

388
00:17:56,620 --> 00:17:58,850
Well, Shinkansen is fast though

389
00:18:01,290 --> 00:18:05,770
Fujimon, Fujimon, Fujimon

390
00:18:05,770 --> 00:18:09,040
-Kurochan dance to the music
-Yes?

391
00:18:24,550 --> 00:18:26,060
It's not interesting at all

392
00:18:26,060 --> 00:18:27,640
-Yeah, seriously
-Eh?

393
00:18:27,640 --> 00:18:29,830
Not at all

394
00:18:30,510 --> 00:18:32,080
Why didn't you do something?

395
00:18:32,080 --> 00:18:33,940
-Do something?
-Add something to your dance

396
00:18:33,940 --> 00:18:36,180
Like something with your own style

397
00:18:36,180 --> 00:18:36,970
My style?

398
00:18:36,970 --> 00:18:39,240
Did you even try to make him laugh just now?

399
00:18:39,240 --> 00:18:40,850
You just muddled through right?

400
00:18:40,850 --> 00:18:43,480
No, you asked me to dance, so I just danced to the music

401
00:18:43,480 --> 00:18:45,980
No one will laugh if you just dance to the music

402
00:18:45,980 --> 00:18:49,490
Next station is Shin-Osaka

403
00:18:49,490 --> 00:18:51,040
Eh, it's speaking

404
00:18:56,340 --> 00:18:57,590
It was speaking all the time

405
00:18:57,590 --> 00:18:59,410
Yeah, it's just this kind of toy

406
00:18:59,410 --> 00:19:00,770
Eh, did it speak before...

407
00:19:00,770 --> 00:19:03,350
Ah, it's speaking

408
00:19:03,350 --> 00:19:05,520
You never saw something like this when you're a kid?

409
00:19:05,520 --> 00:19:08,900
-No, never
-Then what toys did you play with as a child?

410
00:19:08,900 --> 00:19:10,650
-What kind of toys?
-Eh, Famicom

411
00:19:10,650 --> 00:19:12,270
What's that answer

412
00:19:12,750 --> 00:19:13,710
Other than Famicom?

413
00:19:13,710 --> 00:19:15,800
Others?

414
00:19:16,900 --> 00:19:18,170
Others?

415
00:19:18,170 --> 00:19:20,710
All that you played is Famicom?

416
00:19:20,710 --> 00:19:22,710
-No, no
-Then tell us

417
00:19:22,710 --> 00:19:25,710
Eh, flints

418
00:19:25,920 --> 00:19:27,710
Flints?

419
00:19:27,710 --> 00:19:29,690
-Your parents bought it for you?
-Yes

420
00:19:30,130 --> 00:19:31,490
Is that even a toy?

421
00:19:31,490 --> 00:19:33,700
That's not a toy dude

422
00:19:33,700 --> 00:19:36,730
Next station is Shin-Osaka

423
00:19:36,730 --> 00:19:37,990
Ah, it's speaking again

424
00:19:37,990 --> 00:19:40,780
We told you because it's just this kind of toy

425
00:19:40,780 --> 00:19:42,670
-Were there these kind of toys?
-Of course

426
00:19:43,470 --> 00:19:45,730
Eh, who's voice is this?

427
00:19:45,730 --> 00:19:47,570
Prominent people?

428
00:19:47,570 --> 00:19:57,580
He said prominent people...

429
00:19:58,810 --> 00:19:59,800
Are you really Kurochan?

430
00:19:59,800 --> 00:20:00,150
Eh?

431
00:20:00,150 --> 00:20:02,090
Are you really Kurochan?

432
00:20:02,090 --> 00:20:04,260
Yes, I'm the real Kurochan

433
00:20:04,260 --> 00:20:05,080
Shiro-chan?

434
00:20:04,260 --> 00:20:06,810
*Kuro means black and Shiro means white

435
00:20:05,080 --> 00:20:06,810
That's a wrong color, an opposite one

436
00:20:06,810 --> 00:20:09,400
That was so fast

437
00:20:09,400 --> 00:20:10,600
I have hair?

438
00:20:09,400 --> 00:20:12,040
*"So fast" and "have hair" sound similar

439
00:20:10,600 --> 00:20:12,040
No, I mean fast

440
00:20:12,040 --> 00:20:13,060
Ao-chan?

441
00:20:12,040 --> 00:20:15,790
*Ao means blue

442
00:20:13,060 --> 00:20:15,790
No, I'm not a healing color like blue

443
00:20:15,790 --> 00:20:16,680
Aka-chan?

444
00:20:16,680 --> 00:20:19,820
-We are always chil...children in our parents’ eyes
-You just bite*

445
00:20:16,680 --> 00:20:22,800
*Aka-chan means baby
*"Bite" means tripping over your own tongue

446
00:20:19,820 --> 00:20:22,800
No I didn't, I only bite my lips when I'm frustrated

447
00:20:22,800 --> 00:20:25,110
You bite a chewing gum too

448
00:20:25,110 --> 00:20:25,950
Never

449
00:20:25,950 --> 00:20:27,140
Kiiro-chan?

450
00:20:25,950 --> 00:20:29,140
*Kiiro means yellow color

451
00:20:27,140 --> 00:20:29,140
No I'm not an expansive color

452
00:20:29,140 --> 00:20:29,800
Amazing

453
00:20:29,800 --> 00:20:30,950
Aka-chan?

454
00:20:30,950 --> 00:20:33,330
We are always children in our parents’ eyes

455
00:20:33,330 --> 00:20:34,500
No, you said that before

456
00:20:34,500 --> 00:20:37,400
Wait, wait a second...don't do this to your partner dude

457
00:20:38,780 --> 00:20:40,560
I'm feeling distant

458
00:20:40,560 --> 00:20:42,380
Looks like good friends though

459
00:20:42,380 --> 00:20:44,240
It's fine to do this right?

460
00:20:44,240 --> 00:20:47,500
It looks like the photo of young actors

461
00:20:47,500 --> 00:20:49,720
Do young actors take this kind of photos?

462
00:20:49,720 --> 00:20:54,520
Young actors be like "How are you doing buddy"

463
00:20:54,520 --> 00:20:56,280
Between you two?

464
00:20:56,280 --> 00:20:58,280
We looked like that just now

465
00:20:58,280 --> 00:20:59,560
You mean Fujimon-san?

466
00:20:59,560 --> 00:21:01,810
Who do you mean?

467
00:21:01,810 --> 00:21:03,420
You mean me?

468
00:21:03,420 --> 00:21:04,980
Who?

469
00:21:04,980 --> 00:21:05,950
What happened?

470
00:21:06,410 --> 00:21:08,420
Wait a second...

471
00:21:08,420 --> 00:21:09,520
What are you doing?

472
00:21:09,520 --> 00:21:11,720
What's going on Nobu?

473
00:21:11,720 --> 00:21:14,490
Wait a second, no, no, no

474
00:21:14,490 --> 00:21:15,910
You're the only one laughing

475
00:21:15,910 --> 00:21:17,060
Wait a second, it's you...

476
00:21:17,060 --> 00:21:20,070
What? No, I did nothing wrong

477
00:21:20,070 --> 00:21:21,480
I did nothing wrong right?

478
00:21:21,480 --> 00:21:23,500
Why is everyone staring at me all of a sudden?

479
00:21:23,500 --> 00:21:25,520
Of course we will

480
00:21:25,520 --> 00:21:27,930
Because you started Tsukommi

481
00:21:27,930 --> 00:21:29,560
Please don't...I didn't laugh...

482
00:21:29,560 --> 00:21:32,000
Matsumoto-san, I really didn't laugh

483
00:21:32,000 --> 00:21:34,680
That wasn't even funny

484
00:21:34,680 --> 00:21:37,680
Chidori seems to be really weak

485
00:21:37,680 --> 00:21:39,680
Yeah, we're both easily amused

486
00:21:39,680 --> 00:21:41,120
Chidori is so weak

487
00:21:41,120 --> 00:21:42,190
Nothing even happened

488
00:21:42,190 --> 00:21:43,270
Yeah, nothing happened

489
00:21:43,270 --> 00:21:46,450
Even the audiences are not laughing at all

490
00:21:46,450 --> 00:21:48,680
-You're the only one laughing
-Yeah, exactly

491
00:21:48,680 --> 00:21:50,830
You're the only one laughing in Japan

492
00:21:50,830 --> 00:21:53,650
I don't want to lose like that

493
00:21:54,690 --> 00:21:57,940
It looks like the photo of young actors

494
00:21:57,940 --> 00:22:00,120
Do young actors take this kind of photos?

495
00:22:00,120 --> 00:22:04,740
Young actors be like "How are you doing buddy"

496
00:22:04,740 --> 00:22:06,690
Between you two?

497
00:22:06,690 --> 00:22:09,220
We looked like that just now

498
00:22:09,220 --> 00:22:10,820
You mean Fujimon-san?

499
00:22:10,820 --> 00:22:12,110
Who do you mean?

500
00:22:12,110 --> 00:22:13,180
(He's already laughing at this point)

501
00:22:13,180 --> 00:22:14,740
You mean me?

502
00:22:15,920 --> 00:22:18,860
What's funny about this?

503
00:22:20,380 --> 00:22:22,050
What's so funny about this?

504
00:22:22,050 --> 00:22:24,780
Conversely, how did you hold back all these times?

505
00:22:24,780 --> 00:22:26,260
If you're laughing at that

506
00:22:26,260 --> 00:22:29,020
-With such a weak defense
-No, seriously...

507
00:22:29,020 --> 00:22:30,430
Oh no

508
00:22:30,430 --> 00:22:32,930
-Well, you're yellow carded
-Yes

509
00:22:32,930 --> 00:22:34,650
But this really raises my guard

510
00:22:34,650 --> 00:22:39,140
Everyone says that, but no one is really guarded up

511
00:22:39,140 --> 00:22:42,050
It's possible that Chidori will both be out first

512
00:22:42,050 --> 00:22:44,210
That's the worst, I really don't want that to happen

513
00:22:44,210 --> 00:22:47,300
So maybe it's better if I just stay still and don't move

514
00:22:47,940 --> 00:22:49,000
That's none of our business

515
00:22:49,000 --> 00:22:50,620
Yeah, that's none of our business

516
00:22:50,620 --> 00:22:53,560
-Decide it yourself
-None of our business

517
00:22:53,560 --> 00:22:56,400
What is this most easily amused person trying to say?

518
00:22:56,400 --> 00:22:58,090
None of our business

519
00:22:58,090 --> 00:22:59,840
That was a superficial strategy

520
00:22:59,840 --> 00:23:03,270
Today is seriously gonna end early,
only less than an hour has passed

521
00:23:03,270 --> 00:23:04,060
This is awful

522
00:23:04,060 --> 00:23:06,640
-Good luck
-Thank you

523
00:23:08,870 --> 00:23:10,580
If you try to attack, you may end up laughing

524
00:23:10,580 --> 00:23:12,870
-Yeah, that happens
-End up laughing instead

525
00:23:12,870 --> 00:23:15,880
I'll think about this again

526
00:23:15,880 --> 00:23:20,230
I paid one million for this and Matsumoto is watching as well, I need to keep this in mind

527
00:23:20,230 --> 00:23:22,620
-We need to stay calm
-Yeah

528
00:23:22,990 --> 00:23:24,130
Let's start

529
00:23:28,470 --> 00:23:29,660
She's rubbing the cucumbers

530
00:23:29,660 --> 00:23:31,090
Eh?

531
00:23:31,090 --> 00:23:31,920
Girls are amazing

532
00:23:31,920 --> 00:23:33,040
What are you making?

533
00:23:33,040 --> 00:23:37,840
It's some pickled cucumbers

534
00:23:37,840 --> 00:23:40,300
-Eh? It started right?
-Yes, it started

535
00:23:40,300 --> 00:23:43,070
-Oh really?
-It's delicious

536
00:23:43,070 --> 00:23:44,940
What is that?

537
00:23:44,940 --> 00:23:47,370
It's some pickled cucumbers

538
00:23:47,370 --> 00:23:49,220
Thank you

539
00:23:49,220 --> 00:23:50,450
Eat it up

540
00:23:50,450 --> 00:23:53,810
Maybe we'll laugh if she feeds him in a strange way

541
00:23:54,860 --> 00:23:56,180
That's enough

542
00:23:58,430 --> 00:24:00,260
Can you eat it all?

543
00:24:00,260 --> 00:24:03,060
-No, that's too much
-There's two more cucumbers though

544
00:24:03,060 --> 00:24:05,540
Thanks, I'm good

545
00:24:05,540 --> 00:24:07,060
It's leaking

546
00:24:07,060 --> 00:24:08,770
Can you eat it all?

547
00:24:08,770 --> 00:24:10,340
-You can spit it out
-Are you ok?

548
00:24:10,340 --> 00:24:11,820
He's gonna puke

549
00:24:11,820 --> 00:24:13,100
Why are you covering your mouth like that?

550
00:24:13,100 --> 00:24:14,540
Ah, a lot came out

551
00:24:16,800 --> 00:24:19,130
Is Kurosawa-san laughing?

552
00:24:19,130 --> 00:24:21,480
She's laughing

553
00:24:22,570 --> 00:24:25,280
What was that?

554
00:24:25,410 --> 00:24:29,080
She laughed out loud

555
00:24:29,080 --> 00:24:30,350
You didn't even try to hold back

556
00:24:30,350 --> 00:24:31,810
She said "a lot came out"

557
00:24:31,810 --> 00:24:33,840
She said it while laughing foolishly

558
00:24:33,840 --> 00:24:35,260
Like a newly married couple

559
00:24:36,640 --> 00:24:38,760
She screwed it up right, Matsumoto-san?

560
00:24:38,760 --> 00:24:40,500
She definitely screwed it up

561
00:24:40,500 --> 00:24:41,770
What was that?

562
00:24:41,770 --> 00:24:43,800
Because a lot more came out than she expected

563
00:24:43,800 --> 00:24:49,120
-And because it was crunched when it came out
-That's just because he chewed it

564
00:24:49,120 --> 00:24:50,420
Of course it's crunched if he chewed it

565
00:24:55,210 --> 00:24:57,070
Ah, a lot came out

566
00:25:02,470 --> 00:25:03,940
Don't say something like an escort

567
00:25:05,850 --> 00:25:08,000
What do you mean "a lot came out"

568
00:25:08,000 --> 00:25:13,700
-Well, Kurosawa you're yellow carded
-Yes, I'm sorry

569
00:25:23,320 --> 00:25:25,530
-Counter-attacks are fearful
-Yeah it is

570
00:25:25,530 --> 00:25:27,050
-We need to be careful
-Yeah

571
00:25:27,050 --> 00:25:32,090
Hey guys, I actually have strong and powerful arms

572
00:25:32,090 --> 00:25:34,480
I want to life up a guy

573
00:25:34,480 --> 00:25:38,090
Can someone just wear this above your pants?

574
00:25:38,090 --> 00:25:40,170
Who seems to be the skinniest...

575
00:25:40,170 --> 00:25:41,660
No, it's not me

576
00:25:41,660 --> 00:25:43,120
-It's Nobu right?
-Then Nobu-san...

577
00:25:43,120 --> 00:25:44,930
Kurosawa

578
00:25:44,930 --> 00:25:47,930
Kurosawa wait a second, ask Jun-san to do it

579
00:25:47,930 --> 00:25:50,420
-No, you got nominated
-I'm not, no, I'm not nominated

580
00:25:50,420 --> 00:25:52,440
You said it's good to let Nobu do it right?

581
00:25:52,440 --> 00:25:54,930
No, it's not good if I do it

582
00:25:56,030 --> 00:25:57,390
Let Jun-san do it

583
00:25:57,390 --> 00:25:59,390
No, Nobu you've been mentioned by name

584
00:25:59,390 --> 00:26:01,070
Just do it Nobu

585
00:26:01,070 --> 00:26:03,660
Kurosawa, you're terrible

586
00:26:03,660 --> 00:26:04,850
Can I take it off?

587
00:26:04,850 --> 00:26:07,150
-The belt?
-Yes

588
00:26:07,150 --> 00:26:09,090
Wait a second Kurosawa, you are...

589
00:26:10,290 --> 00:26:11,790
You are...

590
00:26:11,790 --> 00:26:15,170
But you can do it with your own underwear too

591
00:26:15,170 --> 00:26:18,100
-Just with your own underwear...
-Everyone can see my underwear now

592
00:26:18,100 --> 00:26:21,860
Wear this please

593
00:26:23,100 --> 00:26:25,180
Wear this above...aww it's disgusting

594
00:26:25,180 --> 00:26:27,100
It's the same underwear as Tsurutaro-san

595
00:26:25,180 --> 00:26:28,940
*Tsurutaro-san is a famed Yogis

596
00:26:27,100 --> 00:26:28,940
No, I don't wear it for yoga

597
00:26:28,940 --> 00:26:31,450
Never mind, it's too gross

598
00:26:31,450 --> 00:26:33,240
So you're not doing it?

599
00:26:33,890 --> 00:26:34,690
What?

600
00:26:34,690 --> 00:26:37,920
-I want to use this to show my power
-But how?

601
00:26:37,920 --> 00:26:39,240
-Your power?
-Yes, my power

602
00:26:39,240 --> 00:26:41,790
Because Kurosawa said she's powerful

603
00:26:41,790 --> 00:26:43,720
What do you want me to do?

604
00:26:43,720 --> 00:26:47,130
You're just embarrassing me for wearing the same underwear as Tsurutaro-san

605
00:26:49,830 --> 00:26:51,460
-Is this the one for Nobu?
-Yes

606
00:26:51,460 --> 00:26:53,590
Can you wear this above your pants?

607
00:26:53,590 --> 00:26:56,640
Let's see who is the real Tsurutaro

608
00:26:57,260 --> 00:26:58,440
Thank you very much

609
00:26:58,440 --> 00:27:01,500
-Are you Tsurutaro too?
-He's not Tsurutaro at all

610
00:27:01,500 --> 00:27:03,390
No, I'm not Tsurutaro-san at all

611
00:27:03,390 --> 00:27:04,600
So what should I do now?

612
00:27:04,600 --> 00:27:07,300
Let's say you come home drunk

613
00:27:07,300 --> 00:27:09,280
And you fell asleep in front of the door

614
00:27:09,280 --> 00:27:14,190
So I'll move you to the bedroom on my own as a strong woman

615
00:27:14,190 --> 00:27:16,480
That must be really tough

616
00:27:16,480 --> 00:27:17,430
That's good

617
00:27:17,430 --> 00:27:19,610
She must be a good wife right?

618
00:27:19,610 --> 00:27:22,260
-It's amazing if she can make it right?
-Yeah, it is

619
00:27:22,260 --> 00:27:23,490
Is there any techniques?

620
00:27:23,490 --> 00:27:25,790
Can you come home drunk please?

621
00:27:25,790 --> 00:27:28,270
That's quite a distance though

622
00:27:28,270 --> 00:27:30,900
-It started?
-Yes

623
00:27:30,900 --> 00:27:33,600
I'm back

624
00:27:33,600 --> 00:27:34,820
I'm so drunk

625
00:27:34,820 --> 00:27:39,190
Oh, come on, you're so drunk again

626
00:27:39,190 --> 00:27:42,220
Oh, don't fall asleep here

627
00:27:42,220 --> 00:27:44,520
Did anyone laughed?

628
00:27:44,520 --> 00:27:47,190
Who laughed?

629
00:27:47,190 --> 00:27:50,590
Probably one of you two laughed during the performance

630
00:27:50,590 --> 00:27:52,890
You laughed while you're acting

631
00:27:52,890 --> 00:27:56,250
No, no way, I didn't laugh

632
00:27:56,250 --> 00:27:58,020
Kurosawa probably laughed

633
00:27:58,020 --> 00:28:00,070
Yeah, Kurosawa laughed

634
00:28:00,070 --> 00:28:02,420
So it's Kurosawa

635
00:28:02,420 --> 00:28:03,940
You can't laugh even if you're performing

636
00:28:03,940 --> 00:28:06,330
That counts as out too

637
00:28:06,330 --> 00:28:07,660
Yeah

638
00:28:07,660 --> 00:28:11,660
Kurosawa just laughed normally

639
00:28:11,660 --> 00:28:14,570
Yeah, we were told not to laugh in performances right?

640
00:28:15,670 --> 00:28:17,120
I'm back

641
00:28:18,440 --> 00:28:19,650
I'm so drunk

642
00:28:19,650 --> 00:28:23,900
Oh, come on, you're so drunk again

643
00:28:23,900 --> 00:28:28,390
Oh, don't fall asleep here

644
00:28:28,390 --> 00:28:30,740
Well, that was...

645
00:28:30,740 --> 00:28:31,430
Excuse me

646
00:28:31,430 --> 00:28:34,500
Wow, orange

647
00:28:34,500 --> 00:28:36,820
-Kurosawa you're close
-You'll be out next time

648
00:28:36,820 --> 00:28:37,800
You're out next time

649
00:28:37,800 --> 00:28:41,200
-Kurosawa you're in danger okay?
-Yes, I got it

650
00:28:43,280 --> 00:28:44,220
That's scary

651
00:28:44,220 --> 00:28:46,340
-It's fine for now right?
-Yeah, it's fine

652
00:28:46,340 --> 00:28:48,130
So you can't even smile

653
00:28:48,130 --> 00:28:50,480
It's awful to leave without finishing any performance

654
00:28:50,480 --> 00:28:51,900
That happens

655
00:28:52,520 --> 00:28:54,400
That always happens

656
00:28:55,310 --> 00:28:56,710
-Shall we continue?
-Yes

657
00:28:56,710 --> 00:28:57,810
Let's do this again

658
00:28:57,810 --> 00:28:59,900
-Sorry for asking you to start again
-No worries

659
00:28:59,900 --> 00:29:01,270
-Be careful
-Even if you're performing

660
00:29:01,270 --> 00:29:02,140
Hold back your laughter

661
00:29:08,960 --> 00:29:10,660
It is a tough day

662
00:29:11,500 --> 00:29:14,680
So tie it up like this

663
00:29:14,680 --> 00:29:16,120
And then...excuse me...

664
00:29:16,120 --> 00:29:18,000
-So I'll then grab here
-What's going on?

665
00:29:18,000 --> 00:29:19,370
It's such a tough day

666
00:29:23,640 --> 00:29:25,570
Huh?

667
00:29:28,400 --> 00:29:31,420
He's heavy

668
00:29:32,710 --> 00:29:35,090
-Is it possible to lift him up like that?
-That's amazing

669
00:29:36,450 --> 00:29:37,630
That's amazing

670
00:29:37,630 --> 00:29:39,570
How can she move forward though?

671
00:29:39,570 --> 00:29:40,650
Did you do something wrong?

672
00:29:40,650 --> 00:29:43,130
No, but he was heavier than I expected

673
00:29:43,130 --> 00:29:45,130
-Oh, I see
-Yeah, I'm quite heavy

674
00:29:45,130 --> 00:29:46,830
-Kurosawa, what are you doing?
-I'm sorry

675
00:29:46,830 --> 00:29:49,650
I just wanted to show off that I'm strong

676
00:29:49,650 --> 00:29:51,190
That was impossible

677
00:29:51,190 --> 00:29:53,140
You should pick someone skinnier

678
00:29:53,140 --> 00:29:54,780
How far did she move him though?

679
00:29:54,780 --> 00:29:55,360
Huh?

680
00:29:55,360 --> 00:29:56,920
How far did she move?

681
00:29:56,920 --> 00:29:58,030
Well, just from there...

682
00:29:58,030 --> 00:30:00,430
One banana, two bananas

683
00:30:00,430 --> 00:30:03,250
Can you bring me some more bananas?

684
00:30:03,890 --> 00:30:05,270
Anymore bananas?

685
00:30:05,270 --> 00:30:07,750
It's not necessary to count it with bananas

686
00:30:07,750 --> 00:30:10,760
Iio-san that's enough, no one will
understand if you count with bananas

687
00:30:10,760 --> 00:30:13,340
We usually say it's how many meters

688
00:30:13,340 --> 00:30:16,340
No one will understand even if you say it's how many bananas

689
00:30:16,340 --> 00:30:20,000
-That's no good, Iio-san
-What do you mean?

690
00:30:20,000 --> 00:30:21,430
Fruits Samurai

691
00:30:21,430 --> 00:30:22,570
What the heck is that?

692
00:30:30,270 --> 00:30:32,610
Mother of Fruits

693
00:30:32,610 --> 00:30:34,370
That's from Ultraman

694
00:30:34,370 --> 00:30:36,590
-I see, so it's from Ultraman
-Fruits Taro

695
00:30:36,590 --> 00:30:39,090
That's from Ultraman again

696
00:30:39,090 --> 00:30:40,890
Can you stop saying fruits though?

697
00:30:40,890 --> 00:30:42,600
That's banana

698
00:30:42,600 --> 00:30:45,200
-Banana is a fruit right?
-Yes it is, but...

699
00:30:45,740 --> 00:30:47,720
He's the only true son of Mother of Ultra

700
00:30:47,720 --> 00:30:49,700
-Yeah
-Oh, he's the only one?

701
00:30:49,700 --> 00:30:50,840
What about the others?

702
00:30:50,840 --> 00:30:52,510
Yes?

703
00:30:53,080 --> 00:30:54,340
The others are relatives

704
00:30:55,870 --> 00:30:57,740
*Ryotsu Kankichi is a manga character with super thick eyebrows

705
00:30:55,870 --> 00:30:57,740
-Ryotsu Kankichi
-Here it comes

706
00:30:57,740 --> 00:30:59,610
It should be Fruits Kankichi

707
00:30:59,610 --> 00:31:01,080
Oh yeah, Fruits Kankichi

708
00:31:01,080 --> 00:31:02,240
How could you say Ryotsu?

709
00:31:02,240 --> 00:31:03,520
How could you not notice it?

710
00:31:03,520 --> 00:31:04,950
That's terrible

711
00:31:04,950 --> 00:31:05,700
Eh?

712
00:31:05,700 --> 00:31:07,300
-What did I do?
-All this time

713
00:31:07,300 --> 00:31:09,380
-Bananas...
-I mean since you become a comedian

714
00:31:09,380 --> 00:31:10,900
That was just a careless mistake

715
00:31:10,900 --> 00:31:17,160
*"Tobojite Tobojite" is a phrase said when feeling sad, invented by the manga character Inakappe Taishou

716
00:31:10,900 --> 00:31:17,160
I'm so sad, Tobojite Tobojite, Fruits Tobojite

717
00:31:17,930 --> 00:31:19,830
Hit your eyes like "don"

718
00:31:19,830 --> 00:31:23,160
-That's scary
-That's dangerous, don't do that

719
00:31:23,160 --> 00:31:25,560
-More, more, show us more
-What?

720
00:31:25,560 --> 00:31:27,560
-Show us more
-More?

721
00:31:27,560 --> 00:31:30,240
Just do it, more characters will pop up

722
00:31:39,140 --> 00:31:44,150
The nipples beam cross section is in heart shape

723
00:31:44,980 --> 00:31:47,090
What's wrong with you?

724
00:31:47,090 --> 00:31:49,470
Come on

725
00:31:49,470 --> 00:31:52,070
Why did you laugh at that?

726
00:31:52,070 --> 00:31:54,520
I have no idea what he's talking about

727
00:31:54,520 --> 00:31:56,780
-What the heck was that?
What?

728
00:31:56,780 --> 00:31:58,190
What the heck did you do?

729
00:31:58,190 --> 00:32:00,740
-Nipples beam
-And the cross section?

730
00:32:00,740 --> 00:32:02,700
Cross section is in heart shape

731
00:32:02,700 --> 00:32:04,380
What the heck is that

732
00:32:04,380 --> 00:32:06,790
You're the one who pushed him hard to perform

733
00:32:06,790 --> 00:32:11,680
Why did you laugh at something so basic at this stage?

734
00:32:11,680 --> 00:32:15,510
That's such a basic failure

735
00:32:15,510 --> 00:32:18,290
-Eh?
-Come on

736
00:32:18,290 --> 00:32:21,450
-It's dangerous to push Kurochan too hard
-Yeah, exactly

737
00:32:23,900 --> 00:32:26,330
(Fujimoto-san is already trying hard to hold back)

738
00:32:27,980 --> 00:32:31,680
The nipples beam cross section is in heart shape

739
00:32:33,980 --> 00:32:36,940
Don't try to play hardball with Kurochan

740
00:32:36,940 --> 00:32:39,330
You have to dodge his attack

741
00:32:39,330 --> 00:32:41,720
His attack hit you right in the face

742
00:32:41,720 --> 00:32:45,540
He attacked right in front of me

743
00:32:45,540 --> 00:32:49,690
You're infinitely close to this...

744
00:32:49,690 --> 00:32:52,020
But a yellow card, you're very close

745
00:32:52,020 --> 00:32:54,050
You're very close to a red card

746
00:32:54,050 --> 00:32:56,640
So Kurochan scores a lot of points now

747
00:32:56,640 --> 00:32:59,040
-Thank you
-Oh yeah

748
00:32:59,040 --> 00:33:01,200
-He scored points for this
-Yes

749
00:33:04,120 --> 00:33:07,240
Let's start

750
00:33:11,590 --> 00:33:13,260
Don't attack Kurochan anymore

751
00:33:13,260 --> 00:33:14,920
Iio-san is the one who started the banana

752
00:33:14,920 --> 00:33:17,310
Please stop this Iio-san

753
00:33:17,830 --> 00:33:19,660
I just tried to attack

754
00:33:19,660 --> 00:33:22,970
Hey guys, can we gather up please?

755
00:33:22,970 --> 00:33:24,730
-Yes?
-So here it comes

756
00:33:24,730 --> 00:33:25,900
I have some horror photos

757
00:33:25,900 --> 00:33:27,680
-Here it comes
-Horror photos?

758
00:33:27,680 --> 00:33:29,780
-No way, stop that
-Seriously?

759
00:33:29,780 --> 00:33:32,720
Stop this series dude

760
00:33:32,720 --> 00:33:35,820
Don't do it, we're definitely going laugh

761
00:33:35,820 --> 00:33:37,320
Don't do it, don't do it this time

762
00:33:37,320 --> 00:33:39,140
No, it's really some horror photos this time

763
00:33:39,140 --> 00:33:41,220
No way, how could that be true

764
00:33:41,220 --> 00:33:41,920
Seriously

765
00:33:41,920 --> 00:33:43,640
We'll laugh if it's really scary too

766
00:33:46,480 --> 00:33:47,490
Stop it please

767
00:33:52,050 --> 00:33:55,250
Is that face fine?

768
00:33:55,250 --> 00:33:57,600
What? Did I look weird?

769
00:34:06,430 --> 00:34:09,270
Kukky really like this

770
00:34:10,840 --> 00:34:13,300
*Kawashima is the real name of Kukky

771
00:34:10,840 --> 00:34:13,300
Stop that Kawashima-san

772
00:34:14,580 --> 00:34:16,530
That's no good

773
00:34:16,530 --> 00:34:18,420
That's really no good

774
00:34:18,420 --> 00:34:21,810
That is just...absolutely no good

775
00:34:21,810 --> 00:34:25,520
Who's denture is that? You're always wearing it

776
00:34:25,520 --> 00:34:26,480
Who's teeth are those?

777
00:34:26,480 --> 00:34:28,160
It's my grandpa's teeth

778
00:34:28,160 --> 00:34:29,600
-He used to wear it?
-Yes

779
00:34:29,600 --> 00:34:30,210
Grandpa?

780
00:34:30,210 --> 00:34:32,920
Don't use a real one dude

781
00:34:32,920 --> 00:34:35,640
-He's still alive though
-So he's still alive

782
00:34:35,640 --> 00:34:38,100
Let's have a look at these horror photos guys

783
00:34:39,600 --> 00:34:41,880
No, let's watch it when everyone is here

784
00:34:41,880 --> 00:34:42,900
Put it away first

785
00:34:42,900 --> 00:34:45,190
-Put it away dude
-Okay, sorry

786
00:34:45,190 --> 00:34:46,690
-Please put it away
-Yes, okay

787
00:34:46,690 --> 00:34:48,290
This is seriously killing me

788
00:34:48,290 --> 00:34:49,460
That's not horror photos

789
00:34:49,460 --> 00:34:52,210
Yes it is, look at it, it's terrifying

790
00:34:52,210 --> 00:34:55,100
-Look over here
-Let's wait until everyone is here

791
00:34:55,100 --> 00:34:56,750
These photos are coming out too early

792
00:34:56,750 --> 00:34:59,470
Yeah, that's too early, it's awful

793
00:34:59,470 --> 00:35:00,770
I hope you can show it later

794
00:35:00,770 --> 00:35:03,350
Shisho is coming

795
00:35:00,770 --> 00:35:13,330
*Hamburger Shisho is the original character that Jun-san is acting

796
00:35:03,350 --> 00:35:05,490
We won't laugh at Shisho

797
00:35:05,490 --> 00:35:07,490
Hey, come over here

798
00:35:07,490 --> 00:35:10,720
-It's not about Shisho now
-Not now

799
00:35:11,120 --> 00:35:13,330
And we won't laugh at Shisho anyway

800
00:35:13,330 --> 00:35:14,750
Oh, really?

801
00:35:14,750 --> 00:35:16,670
Your buckle is a hamburger?

802
00:35:16,670 --> 00:35:19,280
Yeah it is

803
00:35:19,280 --> 00:35:21,340
Please let me do this again

804
00:35:21,340 --> 00:35:23,180
He's living near Roppongi

805
00:35:23,180 --> 00:35:25,400
And we were having a drink there, so we asked him out

806
00:35:25,400 --> 00:35:27,500
-And he came in that costume
-That's amazing

807
00:35:27,500 --> 00:35:28,700
And then...

808
00:35:28,700 --> 00:35:31,290
No one laughed

809
00:35:31,290 --> 00:35:34,030
No one laughed at all

810
00:35:34,030 --> 00:35:35,820
How did that even happen?

811
00:35:35,820 --> 00:35:39,730
-This town doesn't change at all
-Here it starts

812
00:35:39,730 --> 00:35:41,590
What happened?

813
00:35:41,590 --> 00:35:44,640
Why are you looking at me as if I'm the dispensable mixed veggies

814
00:35:44,640 --> 00:35:45,590
No, we didn't

815
00:35:45,590 --> 00:35:47,550
Did you guys forget about me?

816
00:35:47,550 --> 00:35:49,550
It's me

817
00:35:49,550 --> 00:35:52,050
HAMBURGER

818
00:35:52,750 --> 00:35:57,500
What I've prepared for all you starving people,
is the 100 gram Teppan joke

819
00:35:57,500 --> 00:36:01,610
When me, Hamburger, was dawdling at home, my mom said this

820
00:36:01,610 --> 00:36:04,410
Hey Hamburger, why are you always dawdling?

821
00:36:04,410 --> 00:36:07,410
Why don't you find a stable job, you're Hamburger right?

822
00:36:07,410 --> 00:36:08,380
Yep

823
00:36:08,380 --> 00:36:10,060
Here comes the set meal

824
00:36:08,380 --> 00:36:12,720
*Set meal and stable job have the same pronunciation

825
00:36:10,060 --> 00:36:12,720
HAMBURGER

826
00:36:12,720 --> 00:36:14,180
You are so noisy

827
00:36:14,180 --> 00:36:16,380
-That's so loud
-Didn't know it's so loud

828
00:36:16,380 --> 00:36:22,830
Here comes the section that you've all been waiting for, The Challenge Hamburger

829
00:36:25,690 --> 00:36:27,250
Challenge Hamburger?

830
00:36:27,250 --> 00:36:29,460
Is this an interactive performance?

831
00:36:29,460 --> 00:36:38,100
This is the dinner menu of the hamburger restaurant "Gold Rush"

832
00:36:38,100 --> 00:36:44,210
And there's 14 items in total

833
00:36:44,210 --> 00:36:45,380
Fourteen

834
00:36:44,210 --> 00:36:49,600
*Fourteen and juicy have the same pronunciation

835
00:36:45,380 --> 00:36:46,990
Juicy

836
00:36:46,990 --> 00:36:49,600
HAMBURGER

837
00:36:50,530 --> 00:36:53,720
Here starts the Hamburger Challenge

838
00:36:53,720 --> 00:36:56,290
This is so long

839
00:36:56,290 --> 00:36:58,410
-He's so strong
-He's not laughing at these photos

840
00:36:58,410 --> 00:37:02,090
-The photos were translucent, and I almost laughed
-Yeah

841
00:37:02,090 --> 00:37:04,330
So now...

842
00:37:04,330 --> 00:37:07,430
Miyasako-san can you please hold this for me?

843
00:37:07,430 --> 00:37:08,290
What's going on?

844
00:37:08,290 --> 00:37:15,120
I'll be reading these 14 dishes from Gold Rush as fast as possible

845
00:37:16,340 --> 00:37:19,910
Can you count the time please?

846
00:37:19,910 --> 00:37:23,570
Please look forward to how many
seconds it takes for me to read them all

847
00:37:23,570 --> 00:37:25,040
So let's get started

848
00:37:25,040 --> 00:37:26,220

849
00:37:26,220 --> 00:37:28,270

Fourteen seconds

866
00:37:54,240 --> 00:37:55,720
Juicy

00:37:55,720 --> 00:37:57,790
HAMBURGER

868
00:37:58,240 --> 00:38:00,780
No, he said it's two seconds

869
00:38:00,780 --> 00:38:02,330
It's two seconds

870
00:38:03,050 --> 00:38:04,540
That's not in your script?

871
00:38:05,030 --> 00:38:07,290
You don't usually see me in this costume right?

872
00:38:07,290 --> 00:38:11,180
-No, you're in this costume every time I see you
-Yeah, we always see this costume

873
00:38:14,160 --> 00:38:16,770
But you don't usually see me in this cosutme right?

874
00:38:16,770 --> 00:38:20,360
-No, we do
-You always wear like this in Nichima Channel right?

875
00:38:20,360 --> 00:38:22,360
In Osaka?

876
00:38:22,360 --> 00:38:23,260
Like this?

877
00:38:23,260 --> 00:38:24,020
No

878
00:38:24,020 --> 00:38:25,460
-Like this?
-Yes

879
00:38:25,460 --> 00:38:28,180
With both hands?

880
00:38:29,300 --> 00:38:31,180
Like this?

881
00:38:33,670 --> 00:38:36,180
That's a nice one

882
00:38:36,180 --> 00:38:38,970
That's a nice swing

883
00:38:38,970 --> 00:38:42,110
Can you imitate the swing of famous people?

884
00:38:42,110 --> 00:38:43,810
Yeah

885
00:38:43,810 --> 00:38:45,680
Just shout out their name

886
00:38:45,680 --> 00:38:48,620
-How about Ichiro-san?
-Nice choice

887
00:38:48,620 --> 00:38:51,350
He's left-handed

888
00:38:51,990 --> 00:38:53,760
But I'm right-handed

889
00:38:54,560 --> 00:38:57,270
Well, just imitate his movement

890
00:38:58,440 --> 00:39:00,980
That's completely different

891
00:39:00,980 --> 00:39:02,760
He does this first right?

892
00:39:02,760 --> 00:39:05,120
But Ichiro is left-handed, so...

893
00:39:05,120 --> 00:39:06,300
-Well, yeah
-Someone right-handed please

894
00:39:06,300 --> 00:39:08,660
-Who's right-handed?
-Someone who swings with right hand

895
00:39:08,660 --> 00:39:10,830
-What about Ogasawara?
-That's a nice choice

896
00:39:10,830 --> 00:39:13,100
He have some unique movements

897
00:39:13,100 --> 00:39:15,480
But Ogasawara is left-handed too

898
00:39:15,480 --> 00:39:18,350
Ah, he's left-handed

899
00:39:18,350 --> 00:39:19,610
But he's easy to imitate

900
00:39:19,610 --> 00:39:21,560
However, I'm right-handed

901
00:39:21,560 --> 00:39:24,050
Then try to do it on the right side

902
00:39:24,360 --> 00:39:25,500
That's the same dude

903
00:39:27,010 --> 00:39:29,200
Swing it as Ogasawara

904
00:39:29,200 --> 00:39:30,330
What about Matsui?

905
00:39:30,330 --> 00:39:31,970
But Matsui is left-handed too

906
00:39:31,970 --> 00:39:35,110
Just imitate his movement

907
00:39:35,110 --> 00:39:36,310
So like this...

908
00:39:36,310 --> 00:39:37,500
*Fujimon means it should be Matsui Kazuo, instead of Matsui Hideki, who are both famed baseball players

909
00:39:36,310 --> 00:39:37,500
It's Kazuo*

910
00:39:37,500 --> 00:39:38,560
Kazuyo?

911
00:39:37,500 --> 00:39:53,130
*Matsui Kazuyo is a female actor, well-known for uploading videos to YouTube that criticizes his husband Funakoshi for having affairs

912
00:39:40,300 --> 00:39:41,580
O?

913
00:39:41,580 --> 00:39:43,500
Kazu...yo

914
00:39:43,500 --> 00:39:44,160
Yo?

915
00:39:44,160 --> 00:39:46,740
Kazuyo?

916
00:39:46,740 --> 00:39:49,310
The swing of Matsui Kazuyo?

917
00:39:50,620 --> 00:39:53,130
Just imitate how she looks like in those videos

918
00:39:53,130 --> 00:39:54,870
Like a "if someone swings" series right?

919
00:39:54,870 --> 00:39:58,870
If Matsui Kazuyo swings?

920
00:39:58,870 --> 00:40:01,010
On YouTube right?

921
00:40:01,010 --> 00:40:03,200
If she swings on YouTube?

922
00:40:03,200 --> 00:40:06,710
Remember to imitate how she critisizes his husband

923
00:40:06,710 --> 00:40:09,790
-I am...
-Put your hands here

924
00:40:09,790 --> 00:40:11,140
Nice

925
00:40:11,140 --> 00:40:13,230
-I am...
-Nice

926
00:40:13,230 --> 00:40:14,660
Really...

927
00:40:14,660 --> 00:40:16,890
Suffering...

928
00:40:16,890 --> 00:40:24,230
And this is how I swing when I'm suffereing

929
00:40:24,230 --> 00:40:26,980
Please have a look

930
00:40:30,330 --> 00:40:31,420
Nice one

931
00:40:31,420 --> 00:40:34,490
Kazuyo did a nice swing

932
00:40:34,490 --> 00:40:36,250
That's a really nice one

933
00:40:36,250 --> 00:40:38,310
I didn't know Kazuyo can swing so nice

934
00:40:38,310 --> 00:40:41,450
Do Kazuyo swing like that?

935
00:40:42,400 --> 00:40:45,510
She was more emotional in the video

936
00:40:45,510 --> 00:40:47,100
Yeah, you're right

937
00:40:47,100 --> 00:40:53,300
More like how Sarah Connor speaks to his son in Terminator

938
00:40:53,300 --> 00:40:56,430
I don't really watch videos though

939
00:40:56,430 --> 00:40:58,640
Like how Sarah Connor speaks to John Connor

940
00:40:58,640 --> 00:41:02,820
"John, if you're watching this, it means that..."

941
00:41:02,820 --> 00:41:03,530
"You are..."

942
00:41:03,530 --> 00:41:05,840
You're wearing the same tank top as she said this

943
00:41:05,840 --> 00:41:07,240
Completely the same?

944
00:41:07,240 --> 00:41:09,640
Not completely

945
00:41:10,730 --> 00:41:12,060
"You are..."

946
00:41:15,220 --> 00:41:16,760
Are we ready for some horror photos?

947
00:41:16,760 --> 00:41:20,210
-No, not yet
-Kurosawa is still changing clothes

948
00:41:20,210 --> 00:41:21,530
Then let's wait for a while

949
00:41:21,530 --> 00:41:25,640
-I can see her over there
-And her costumes

950
00:41:25,640 --> 00:41:29,000
Hello, hello, hello everybody

951
00:41:29,000 --> 00:41:31,070
I am Daichi Mao

952
00:41:36,080 --> 00:41:37,720
Wait...

953
00:41:37,720 --> 00:41:40,090
I am Daichi Mao

954
00:41:41,070 --> 00:41:42,810
Evil spirits, there's evil spirits

955
00:41:42,810 --> 00:41:44,960
Evil spirits, evil spirits here

956
00:41:44,960 --> 00:41:47,920
Let's exorcise evil spirits

957
00:41:49,940 --> 00:41:52,060
Evil spirits here

958
00:41:52,060 --> 00:41:56,060
Let's exorcise evil spirits

959
00:41:56,060 --> 00:41:57,960
There's evil spirits here

960
00:41:58,860 --> 00:42:00,850
There's a lot of evil spirits here

961
00:42:13,940 --> 00:42:15,790
There's evil spirits

962
00:42:22,310 --> 00:42:24,020
Evil spirits, there's evil spirits

963
00:42:24,020 --> 00:42:26,960
Evil spirits, evil spirits, evil spirits

964
00:42:27,600 --> 00:42:31,200
There's a lot of evil spirits

965
00:42:31,200 --> 00:42:34,570
Wait a second...

966
00:42:34,570 --> 00:42:40,000
Wait, wait, wait...

967
00:42:40,000 --> 00:42:42,710
Wait, wait, wait...

968
00:42:44,770 --> 00:42:45,980
You're scary

969
00:42:45,980 --> 00:42:49,200
Evil spirits, there's evil spirits

970
00:42:49,200 --> 00:42:50,750
This...

971
00:42:50,750 --> 00:42:51,950
This...

972
00:42:51,950 --> 00:42:53,430
This..

973
00:42:53,430 --> 00:42:55,490
Can you hold that end for me please?

974
00:42:56,440 --> 00:42:57,900
This end as well

975
00:42:58,960 --> 00:43:00,490
Thank you very much

976
00:43:01,340 --> 00:43:05,370
Dong, dong, dong

977
00:43:09,350 --> 00:43:11,940
Here comes the straddle

978
00:43:13,260 --> 00:43:14,640
Here comes the straddle

979
00:43:14,640 --> 00:43:19,930
Ah, ah, straddle, straddle

980
00:43:19,930 --> 00:43:22,860
Ah, ah, straddle

981
00:43:22,860 --> 00:43:25,480
Here comes the straddle...hold it up

982
00:43:29,920 --> 00:43:35,290
Ah, ah, straddle, straddle

983
00:43:35,290 --> 00:43:38,320
Ah, ah, straddle

984
00:43:38,320 --> 00:43:40,300
Here comes the straddle

985
00:43:43,360 --> 00:43:45,970
-What is she doing?
-Oh, it's over there

986
00:43:48,030 --> 00:43:50,150
Wait a second...

987
00:43:52,680 --> 00:43:55,500
Ah, ah, straddle

988
00:43:55,500 --> 00:43:58,210
This is awful

989
00:43:58,210 --> 00:44:00,930
This is just...

990
00:44:04,450 --> 00:44:06,850
Did Kurosawa laughed again?

991
00:44:06,850 --> 00:44:08,650
Kurosawa laughed inside there?

992
00:44:08,650 --> 00:44:09,790
Is it me?

993
00:44:09,790 --> 00:44:11,030
Did you laugh again?

994
00:44:11,030 --> 00:44:13,760
Ah, maybe I did laugh

995
00:44:15,360 --> 00:44:17,110
By the way, what's going on with that wig

996
00:44:17,110 --> 00:44:19,180
Kurosawa is out if she laughed though

997
00:44:19,180 --> 00:44:20,140
Eh, who is it?

998
00:44:20,140 --> 00:44:22,110
Kurosawa was orange carded already?

999
00:44:22,110 --> 00:44:24,540
He almost laughed all this time

1000
00:44:24,540 --> 00:44:27,460
And finally, he wasn't able to hold it

1001
00:44:28,330 --> 00:44:28,940
Iio

1002
00:44:31,110 --> 00:44:33,000
-It's Iio-san?
-Yeah, he laughed in the end

1003
00:44:33,000 --> 00:44:34,480
Oh, I'm sorry

1004
00:44:34,480 --> 00:44:40,340
I wasn't able to hold back when she was straddling, I can even feel the rope shaking

1005
00:44:40,340 --> 00:44:41,920
That shake is killing me

1006
00:44:43,110 --> 00:44:50,300
Ah, ah, straddle, straddle

1007
00:44:50,300 --> 00:44:53,040
Wait a second...

1008
00:44:53,040 --> 00:44:56,400
This is awful

1009
00:44:56,400 --> 00:44:59,440
Yeah, he was definitely laughing

1010
00:44:59,440 --> 00:45:01,210
Well, yeah

1011
00:45:01,210 --> 00:45:02,310
I'm sorry

1012
00:45:03,940 --> 00:45:06,260
Well, yellow umm...yeah, maybe yellow

1013
00:45:06,260 --> 00:45:08,040
Yes, thank you

1014
00:45:09,160 --> 00:45:11,450
-Many of us are just one step away
-That's scary

1015
00:45:11,450 --> 00:45:14,400
Yeah you're right, many of you are almost out

1016
00:45:21,640 --> 00:45:24,150
Are we still going to look at the horror photos?

1017
00:45:24,150 --> 00:45:25,740
-You guys wanna watch it?
-Shall we?

1018
00:45:25,740 --> 00:45:29,370
Sure, I haven't shown all of them yet

1019
00:45:29,370 --> 00:45:31,800
Kurosawa-chan, can you sprinkle some salts?

1020
00:45:31,800 --> 00:45:32,550
Ah, excuse me

1021
00:45:32,550 --> 00:45:35,800
Because it's horror photos, maybe you can exorcise it with salt

1022
00:45:35,800 --> 00:45:38,070
-These were on the floor, is that fine?
-That's completely fine

1023
00:45:38,070 --> 00:45:40,620
Excuse me, excuse me

1024
00:45:40,620 --> 00:45:45,620
Oh yeah, just like that

1025
00:45:46,640 --> 00:45:47,900
Horror photos?

1026
00:45:47,900 --> 00:45:49,390
-Yes
-Is it exorcised?

1027
00:45:49,390 --> 00:45:51,440
She tried to exorcise it

1028
00:45:51,440 --> 00:45:54,590
So it should be the normal Shisho now

1029
00:45:54,590 --> 00:45:56,770
It's a photo of Shisho?

1030
00:46:00,420 --> 00:46:02,010
He's looking normal now

1031
00:46:02,010 --> 00:46:04,390
His face is so small

1032
00:46:04,390 --> 00:46:05,310
He has no neck

1033
00:46:05,310 --> 00:46:07,010
-The evil spirits did this?
-Yes

1034
00:46:07,010 --> 00:46:08,990
-It didn't return to normal
-His face is so small

1035
00:46:08,990 --> 00:46:11,100
-Is it exorcised?
-It didn't return to normal at all

1036
00:46:11,100 --> 00:46:13,460
What kind of horror photo is this?

1037
00:46:13,460 --> 00:46:16,050
Which person is possessed by an evil spirit? Daisuke...?

1038
00:46:13,460 --> 00:46:29,040
*Hanako Shisho is the women, and Daisuke Shisho is the man

1039
00:46:16,050 --> 00:46:17,300
It should be Hanako right?

1040
00:46:17,300 --> 00:46:19,230
-You must be joking
-It's Daisuke Shisho

1041
00:46:19,230 --> 00:46:24,480
-No way, Hanako-san looks normal
-No, it must be Hanako-san, just look at her face

1042
00:46:24,480 --> 00:46:26,130
-So Hanako Shisho is being possessed?
-Yes

1043
00:46:26,130 --> 00:46:29,040
But he looks so small somehow

1044
00:46:29,040 --> 00:46:31,590
-Please look at it
-Yes I am

1045
00:46:32,940 --> 00:46:34,830
-Miyasako is not looking at it right?
-Yes, I am

1046
00:46:34,830 --> 00:46:36,860
Miyasako-san is just looking at somewhere over here

1047
00:46:36,860 --> 00:46:38,280
No, I am looking at it

1048
00:46:38,280 --> 00:46:40,090
This is the vertical version

1049
00:46:40,090 --> 00:46:42,310
-Vertical?
-Vertical version?

1050
00:46:46,580 --> 00:46:47,850
I am looking at it

1051
00:46:48,780 --> 00:46:49,500
I am, I am

1052
00:46:49,500 --> 00:46:50,920
That's so stupid

1053
00:46:50,920 --> 00:46:54,530
I've prepared photos for everyone too, please pass it around

1054
00:46:54,530 --> 00:46:56,000
For everyone?

1055
00:46:56,000 --> 00:46:57,780
Not for everyone, please

1056
00:46:57,780 --> 00:46:59,780
So you mean individually?

1057
00:46:59,780 --> 00:47:01,240
Yes, I'll pass it to you individually

1058
00:47:01,240 --> 00:47:02,660
Come on, not for everyone, please

1059
00:47:02,660 --> 00:47:05,540
Wait...can you start with people who are not carded first?

1060
00:47:05,540 --> 00:47:07,670
That's our only request, please

1061
00:47:07,670 --> 00:47:09,300
Give it to the carded group afterwards

1062
00:47:09,300 --> 00:47:11,720
I'm really sorry, but please

1063
00:47:11,720 --> 00:47:13,000
Please

1064
00:47:13,000 --> 00:47:13,700
I'm carded

1065
00:47:13,700 --> 00:47:15,550
-I'm carded
-I got one card too

1066
00:47:15,550 --> 00:47:17,440
-I'm yellow carded
-Yellow too

1067
00:47:17,440 --> 00:47:18,720
Seriously, please

1068
00:47:18,720 --> 00:47:20,140
Well, I understand this

1069
00:47:20,140 --> 00:47:22,290
I'm sorry, please excuse us for this

1070
00:47:22,290 --> 00:47:24,980
Hey dude, why are you showing it to us?

1071
00:47:24,980 --> 00:47:26,910
-Are you an idiot?
-You heard what we said right?

1072
00:47:26,910 --> 00:47:29,020
Show it to them! To them!

1073
00:47:29,020 --> 00:47:30,670
To those who didn't get any cards

1074
00:47:30,670 --> 00:47:32,670
Have a look at it yourself

1075
00:47:32,670 --> 00:47:34,380
-This...
-Ku-chan

1076
00:47:34,380 --> 00:47:36,630
Seriously, don't do this Kukky-san

1077
00:47:36,630 --> 00:47:38,060
We'll be out

1078
00:47:38,060 --> 00:47:39,640
We will all be out

1079
00:47:39,640 --> 00:47:40,580
We'll be out Kukky-san

1080
00:47:40,580 --> 00:47:42,150
Choose one representative then

1081
00:47:42,150 --> 00:47:43,870
No, please don't do that

1082
00:47:43,870 --> 00:47:45,470
Come on, please

1083
00:47:45,470 --> 00:47:46,770
Don't put it here smoothly

1084
00:47:46,300 --> 00:47:51,980
*(CARD) When I saw a girl vomiting, I had an erection

1085
00:47:46,770 --> 00:47:47,660
Please, don't put it smoothly

1086
00:47:47,660 --> 00:47:49,980
These things actually really happened to him

1087
00:47:49,980 --> 00:47:51,980
-You mean to Shisho
-Yes

1088
00:47:51,980 --> 00:47:53,580
Wait a second, wait a second

1089
00:47:53,580 --> 00:47:56,060
Ku, please

1090
00:47:57,330 --> 00:47:58,760
Read it out loud

1091
00:48:02,520 --> 00:48:03,730
Is that a true story?

1092
00:48:03,730 --> 00:48:04,960
Yes, that's a true story

1093
00:48:04,960 --> 00:48:06,710
Look at it, come on

1094
00:48:06,710 --> 00:48:07,950
Look at it

1095
00:48:08,060 --> 00:48:13,690
*(CARD) When I was humping, and my wife saw it, I was dead

1096
00:48:12,650 --> 00:48:13,690
Are you looking at it?

1097
00:48:13,690 --> 00:48:16,450
You're not looking at it, Fujimon, you're not looking at it

1098
00:48:16,450 --> 00:48:17,930
Look at it

1099
00:48:17,930 --> 00:48:19,360
Nobu is not looking at it too

1100
00:48:19,360 --> 00:48:20,580
Come on, look at it

1101
00:48:20,580 --> 00:48:22,580
I'm looking at it

1102
00:48:22,580 --> 00:48:24,410
Well, I think this one should be fine

1103
00:48:24,410 --> 00:48:28,950
*(CARD) This shit is worth ¥100,000? Please let me eat it

1104
00:48:35,290 --> 00:48:36,960
Look at it, Nobu, look at it

1105
00:48:36,960 --> 00:48:38,030
What's that face?

1106
00:48:38,030 --> 00:48:39,810
Please don't say Nobu

1107
00:48:39,810 --> 00:48:40,780
This face should be out

1108
00:48:40,780 --> 00:48:41,760
Come on, have a look

1109
00:48:41,760 --> 00:48:43,700
That's cheating

1110
00:48:43,700 --> 00:48:46,470
Nobu, look at it

1111
00:48:47,170 --> 00:48:52,780
*(CARD) I think I had it when I was 40 years old, I had a vasectomy

1112
00:48:48,360 --> 00:48:49,690
Nobu

1113
00:48:54,400 --> 00:48:55,990
Come on, Nobu, look at it

1114
00:48:56,800 --> 00:48:59,380
-You're not looking at all
-Yes, I am

1115
00:48:59,380 --> 00:49:01,930
Yeah I looked at it, he had a vasectomy right?

1116
00:49:01,930 --> 00:49:03,380
Yep, I see

1117
00:49:03,380 --> 00:49:04,820
*(CARD) I'm going to buy some Yomeishu (medicinal alcohol)

1118
00:49:03,380 --> 00:49:05,780
Are these words...Ka-ha

1119
00:49:05,780 --> 00:49:07,670
Ka-ha?

1120
00:49:07,670 --> 00:49:09,830
Wait a second, wait a second...

1121
00:49:09,830 --> 00:49:12,460
Wait a second please, come on...

1122
00:49:12,460 --> 00:49:16,910
-You guys are too much
-What was that just now?

1123
00:49:16,910 --> 00:49:18,910
That was a tough one

1124
00:49:18,910 --> 00:49:21,310
Yeah, that was a tough one

1125
00:49:21,310 --> 00:49:24,260
Come on, this can't be true

1126
00:49:24,260 --> 00:49:27,250
Matsumoto-san...

1127
00:49:27,250 --> 00:49:29,850
-There's nothing we can do about it
-He definitely laughed

1128
00:49:29,850 --> 00:49:33,070
What was that ka-ha?

1129
00:49:33,070 --> 00:49:35,950
-This is the first time this has happened
-He said Ka-ha right?

1130
00:49:35,950 --> 00:49:38,390
He went like Ka-ha right?

1131
00:49:38,390 --> 00:49:42,800
Wait a second, Matsumoto-san, no one can hold back on this

1132
00:49:42,800 --> 00:49:43,990
Yomeishu...

1133
00:49:42,800 --> 00:49:48,090
*(CARD) I'm going to buy some Yomeishu (medicinal alcohol)

1134
00:49:43,990 --> 00:49:46,710
He really seems to say this

1135
00:49:46,710 --> 00:49:50,750
Yeah, this is hilarious, it's hard to hold back

1136
00:49:52,770 --> 00:49:53,660
Yes, I'm looking

1137
00:49:53,660 --> 00:49:54,860
Look at it Nobu

1138
00:49:54,860 --> 00:49:56,870
Yeah I looked at it, he had a vasectomy right?

1139
00:49:56,870 --> 00:49:58,590
Nobu

1140
00:49:58,590 --> 00:50:00,670
*(CARD) I'm going to buy some Yomeishu (medicinal alcohol)

1141
00:49:58,590 --> 00:50:00,670
Are these words...Ka-ha

1142
00:50:06,510 --> 00:50:07,870
Matsumoto-san

1143
00:50:07,870 --> 00:50:10,920
No, that was just a dialogue

1144
00:50:10,920 --> 00:50:12,990
That's the highest level of laughing

1145
00:50:12,990 --> 00:50:15,040
What is that Ka-ha dude?

1146
00:50:15,640 --> 00:50:17,290
-You're orange carded
-Thank you

1147
00:50:17,290 --> 00:50:18,970
You're very close now

1148
00:50:18,970 --> 00:50:22,140
You'll be out next time
