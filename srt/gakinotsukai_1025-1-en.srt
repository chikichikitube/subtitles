00:00:00,540 --> 00:00:03,380
At NTV

2
00:00:03,300 --> 00:00:05,360
First time on Gaki No Tsukai CHIKI CHIKI

3
00:00:05,480 --> 00:00:09,350
Trivia Drive GO GO

4
00:00:11,060 --> 00:00:12,600
In front of NTV

5
00:00:12,000 --> 00:00:13,720
Indeed that's what this is

6
00:00:13,720 --> 00:00:15,640
Today's project is very simple,

7
00:00:15,640 --> 00:00:18,820
The 5 of us are gonna go for a drive,

8
00:00:18,820 --> 00:00:23,260
And we'll see buildings, billboards, people and whatnot,

9
00:00:23,260 --> 00:00:25,620
And come up with some trivia related to that

10
00:00:25,620 --> 00:00:26,660
I see

11
00:00:26,060 --> 00:00:28,290
Show off our trivia knowledge

12
00:00:28,800 --> 00:00:31,500
The drive won't end until we say 100 things!

13
00:00:31,500 --> 00:00:33,140
Wow, a 100?

14
00:00:33,500 --> 00:00:36,600
I think Yamasaki-san and I should be good at this

15
00:00:36,100 --> 00:00:37,640
I'm a natural

16
00:00:37,040 --> 00:00:39,760
We'll spout trivia at the same pace as our advance

17
00:00:39,860 --> 00:00:40,820
Really?

18
00:00:40,820 --> 00:00:42,980
I'm not sure about these guys though

19
00:00:42,980 --> 00:00:44,940
Yeah these two, honestly-

20
00:00:44,940 --> 00:00:46,910
"These two"?! What about you?!

21
00:00:48,340 --> 00:00:51,540
He knows about animals

22
00:00:49,220 --> 00:00:50,860
Yeah I know a little bit

23
00:00:50,860 --> 00:00:52,460
Ah, animals?

24
00:00:51,540 --> 00:00:52,480
I know sports

25
00:00:52,480 --> 00:00:54,700
Oh yeah!

26
00:00:53,320 --> 00:00:55,000
That's true

27
00:00:55,220 --> 00:00:56,580
Sorry Hamada-san

28
00:00:56,660 --> 00:01:00,270
Let us look you up and down

29
00:00:58,960 --> 00:01:00,480
What the hell?!

30
00:01:00,720 --> 00:01:02,700
In a condescending way

31
00:01:01,120 --> 00:01:03,140
Ah I see

32
00:01:03,440 --> 00:01:06,780
Our route will be National Route 1

33
00:01:06,920 --> 00:01:08,220
National Route 1?

34
00:01:08,440 --> 00:01:10,380
Incidentally, this National Route 1,

35
00:01:10,380 --> 00:01:14,140
It's not called that because it was the first route ever made,

36
00:01:14,140 --> 00:01:18,280
It's cause it's the mope- most impopant route-

37
00:01:17,480 --> 00:01:18,680
Enough already!

38
00:01:18,820 --> 00:01:20,180
Alright that's one!

39
00:01:19,780 --> 00:01:21,640
What are you on about

00:01:25,460 --> 00:01:36,980

41
00:01:37,540 --> 00:01:42,900
This episode, they will spout trivia as they drive

42
00:01:43,360 --> 00:01:45,980
Following National Route 1,

43
00:01:45,980 --> 00:01:49,680
An outside voice will judge the validity of their trivia

44
00:01:52,060 --> 00:01:57,280
The drive doesn't end until they've come up with 100 bits of trivia!!

45
00:01:59,180 --> 00:02:00,680
Here we go

46
00:02:00,760 --> 00:02:01,740
Hurry up!

47
00:02:02,960 --> 00:02:06,980
The endless drive starts with Endo at the wheel

48
00:02:07,720 --> 00:02:09,140
We've started right?

49
00:02:08,120 --> 00:02:11,260
I've already said the National Route 1 trivia,

50
00:02:11,300 --> 00:02:13,980
So by now,

51
00:02:13,980 --> 00:02:17,140
You guys must be overflowing with trivia

52
00:02:17,140 --> 00:02:19,980
You can't wait to spit it all out right?

53
00:02:20,140 --> 00:02:23,060
Basically we see something and say it right?

54
00:02:21,720 --> 00:02:25,840
Well yes

55
00:02:26,040 --> 00:02:27,520
Alright then,

56
00:02:27,520 --> 00:02:32,700
This is something that surprised me when I went to the Netherlands some years ago,

57
00:02:32,920 --> 00:02:36,510
Their 1st and 2nd floors are different from Japan's

58
00:02:37,140 --> 00:02:39,780
Instead, they start with the 0th floor

59
00:02:42,380 --> 00:02:45,220
So what we call the 2nd floor is their 1st floor

60
00:02:46,300 --> 00:02:49,650
So if Japanese people visit Netherlands, they'll probably panic!

61
00:02:50,180 --> 00:02:51,830
That last part was unnecessary

62
00:02:50,930 --> 00:02:52,580
Why?!

63
00:02:52,980 --> 00:02:54,860
Isn't that what this is about?

64
00:02:54,960 --> 00:02:56,920
What do you mean-

65
00:02:57,000 --> 00:02:59,010
See!

66
00:02:57,180 --> 00:03:03,940
In the Netherlands, buildings start at floor 0

67
00:02:59,620 --> 00:03:01,690
This is what this is about

68
00:03:02,040 --> 00:03:07,060
This is a really great start isn't it?

69
00:03:07,060 --> 00:03:10,660
What did you see that reminded you of the Netherlands?

70
00:03:10,660 --> 00:03:13,820
These buildings, they have a first floor don't they?

71
00:03:12,740 --> 00:03:17,460
The trivia must be related to something they saw!

72
00:03:13,820 --> 00:03:18,860
You should say that then, "Looking at these buildings"

73
00:03:16,040 --> 00:03:17,320
Yeah

74
00:03:17,320 --> 00:03:18,860
The concept of 0 right?

75
00:03:18,860 --> 00:03:21,400
The concept of 0 is a good one

76
00:03:21,480 --> 00:03:23,840
Alright then, going off the concept of 0

77
00:03:24,620 --> 00:03:28,680
Computers can display images and whatnot right?

78
00:03:28,680 --> 00:03:33,230
In implementation, they are just arrangements of 1s and 0s

79
00:03:34,060 --> 00:03:35,260
Hold on, I don't get it

80
00:03:35,260 --> 00:03:39,310
For example, the character あ is "01"

81
00:03:39,680 --> 00:03:42,380
And い could be "001"

82
00:03:42,380 --> 00:03:45,540
They're just arrangements of 0s and 1s

83
00:03:44,040 --> 00:03:46,040
They're just arrangements

84
00:03:47,020 --> 00:03:50,440
I wish someone else said that though

85
00:03:50,720 --> 00:03:52,100
Someone a bit more...

86
00:03:52,360 --> 00:03:55,440
I didn't want to hear from a "000" person

87
00:03:56,280 --> 00:03:57,340
000?

88
00:03:56,980 --> 00:04:02,780
Computers use binary to represent information

89
00:03:57,340 --> 00:03:58,770
Oh wow

90
00:03:59,120 --> 00:04:00,320
Amazing

91
00:04:00,320 --> 00:04:05,420
Can I go next? Going off of Matsumoto's foriegn travel, which would've been on an airplane

92
00:04:05,840 --> 00:04:09,800
You'll never board an airplane from the right side, it's always the left

93
00:04:10,240 --> 00:04:11,820
Oh yeah, now that you say it...

94
00:04:10,840 --> 00:04:14,020
Yeah, and the reason why is,

95
00:04:14,240 --> 00:04:19,140
You may know of America's Boeing and Europe's Airbus

96
00:04:19,140 --> 00:04:21,700
Boeing makes airplanes now,

97
00:04:21,700 --> 00:04:24,120
But they started off making boats

98
00:04:24,120 --> 00:04:29,140
And on a boat the anchor is on the right, and you board from the left

99
00:04:29,760 --> 00:04:33,240
And that legacy continued to their airplanes,

100
00:04:33,240 --> 00:04:37,800
So that's why airfields became Airports,

101
00:04:38,160 --> 00:04:41,700
And also the uh, things like, um, uhh

102
00:04:42,180 --> 00:04:45,020
Like the pilots and so on

103
00:04:45,860 --> 00:04:47,220
Umm

104
00:04:47,220 --> 00:04:49,080
The cabin attendants,

105
00:04:50,320 --> 00:04:52,320
Now I'm not so convinced

106
00:04:53,000 --> 00:04:58,970
But the most important takeaway, is why we get on airplanes from the left

107
00:04:59,220 --> 00:05:01,620
That's the lesson I want you all to take away from this

108
00:05:02,780 --> 00:05:04,910
Oh that was close!

109
00:05:04,910 --> 00:05:08,870
I thought it was good, but the delivery could've been better

110
00:05:07,840 --> 00:05:09,580
That's true

111
00:05:09,580 --> 00:05:12,420
I felt concerned for my junior there

112
00:05:12,420 --> 00:05:13,720
I apologise

113
00:05:14,140 --> 00:05:15,600
Ah Tokyo Tower!

114
00:05:15,600 --> 00:05:16,220
Oh?

115
00:05:16,220 --> 00:05:17,660
Yes, to our left

116
00:05:17,660 --> 00:05:19,460
Can I use Tokyo Tower?

117
00:05:19,460 --> 00:05:20,890
Yes go ahead

118
00:05:20,190 --> 00:05:23,020
Tokyo Tower is made of steel right?

119
00:05:23,020 --> 00:05:25,410
The girders that it's made of

120
00:05:25,760 --> 00:05:29,300
It's made from tanks right?

121
00:05:27,820 --> 00:05:29,300
You're stealing my trivia?

122
00:05:29,560 --> 00:05:33,840
The US made a ton of tanks, and after the war

123
00:05:33,340 --> 00:05:34,620
He took it from you!\

124
00:05:34,120 --> 00:05:36,000
Why?

125
00:05:36,620 --> 00:05:41,500
And there was a crap ton of scrap metal from those tanks

126
00:05:41,720 --> 00:05:43,780
And then, those tanks,

127
00:05:43,780 --> 00:05:45,560
Recover it!

128
00:05:44,860 --> 00:05:46,520
They said "you guys buy them"

129
00:05:46,020 --> 00:05:47,280
They said "buy them"

130
00:05:47,280 --> 00:05:49,820
So Japan bought them,

131
00:05:49,820 --> 00:05:52,340
Shut up you two!

132
00:05:52,340 --> 00:05:54,060
What is this back and forth stealing

133
00:05:54,060 --> 00:05:55,740
Cause I already know this!

134
00:05:55,020 --> 00:05:56,520
Really?

135
00:05:56,520 --> 00:05:58,900
Yama-chan you can't let him steal it from you

136
00:05:57,260 --> 00:06:03,060
Nobody was impressed so this trivia didn't count

137
00:05:58,900 --> 00:06:01,020
Wasn't I the one who told you this fact?

138
00:06:01,020 --> 00:06:02,810
Oh yeah
Let's avoid this sort of thing

139
00:06:03,900 --> 00:06:08,440
The smooth going trivia drive finally reaches National Route 1

140
00:06:04,340 --> 00:06:09,060
Trivia Count:  3

141
00:06:09,060 --> 00:06:11,780
There was that trivia about numbers just now,

142
00:06:11,980 --> 00:06:14,920
You know Pi, the 3.14 number?

143
00:06:14,920 --> 00:06:18,020
It continues forever right?

144
00:06:17,120 --> 00:06:18,260
Yeah

145
00:06:18,260 --> 00:06:21,780
They say within those infinite digits,

146
00:06:21,780 --> 00:06:25,420
You can find every possible sequence of numbers

147
00:06:25,420 --> 00:06:29,440
For example, my phone number

148
00:06:29,440 --> 00:06:35,080
Or our numbers, every number sequence in this world is in Pi

149
00:06:31,460 --> 00:06:32,640
Woah!

150
00:06:35,080 --> 00:06:37,380
Well obviously, cause it's infinite

151
00:06:39,530 --> 00:06:40,780
Yes

152
00:06:39,530 --> 00:06:41,670
Everything is in there ?!

153
00:06:40,780 --> 00:06:43,660
Well cause it's infinite, of course, cause it's infinite

154
00:06:44,180 --> 00:06:46,140
C'mon, just act impressed

155
00:06:44,380 --> 00:06:53,820
Pi contains all possible number sequences

156
00:06:46,140 --> 00:06:49,260
Yeah just let us be impressed

157
00:06:49,660 --> 00:06:50,840
Yeah

158
00:06:54,580 --> 00:07:02,580
Do you know how they decided on the
blue yellow red traffic signals?

159
00:07:02,580 --> 00:07:06,020
The most important one is of course red, meaning stop

160
00:07:04,680 --> 00:07:05,960
Right, cause it's dangerous

161
00:07:06,020 --> 00:07:09,880
So even with roadside trees or billboards ahead of it

162
00:07:09,880 --> 00:07:12,740
It's the most visible

163
00:07:12,900 --> 00:07:14,200
It's the rightmost signal

164
00:07:13,400 --> 00:07:16,060
They gotta distance if from the green light

165
00:07:17,140 --> 00:07:23,900
In order to be visible even with roadside trees blocking the view, the red light is furthest to the right

166
00:07:18,560 --> 00:07:21,100
We got it!

167
00:07:21,740 --> 00:07:23,700
Yeah we got it

168
00:07:23,900 --> 00:07:24,940
Hamada-san!

169
00:07:24,940 --> 00:07:28,020
You can use something you see if you want

170
00:07:28,020 --> 00:07:29,940
Ah, that,

171
00:07:30,220 --> 00:07:34,080
Did you know there's always an Origin Bento nearby a 7/11?

172
00:07:34,080 --> 00:07:36,700
Ah is that so? I didn't know that

173
00:07:36,820 --> 00:07:38,580
There's an Origin Bento there

174
00:07:38,580 --> 00:07:40,640
Where? Oh there!

175
00:07:40,640 --> 00:07:44,740
Origin Bento has stores nearby 7/11s,

176
00:07:44,740 --> 00:07:49,580
Cause 7/11 has good information on where to open stores, that's how they choose locations

177
00:07:49,580 --> 00:07:53,600
So in order to save money on research,

178
00:07:53,700 --> 00:07:56,960
They thought "If we open near them we'll get customers!"

179
00:07:55,940 --> 00:07:57,400
Ah it'll be popular!

180
00:07:58,180 --> 00:07:59,740
That's what I've heard

181
00:08:01,940 --> 00:08:09,100
Origin Bento places its stores near 7/11s

182
00:08:02,380 --> 00:08:05,000
That felt great!

183
00:08:05,260 --> 00:08:07,640
Wow, I didn't know that was a thing

184
00:08:09,220 --> 00:08:11,840
Is there any schoolgirl trivia?

185
00:08:11,840 --> 00:08:13,540
Schoolgirls...

186
00:08:14,900 --> 00:08:18,100
Schoolgirls go to Shibuya 109 often right?

187
00:08:14,900 --> 00:08:18,100
TN: A department store

188
00:08:18,320 --> 00:08:21,580
The pro-golfer Katayama Shingo,

189
00:08:21,680 --> 00:08:24,780
He's known to wear that hat,

190
00:08:21,700 --> 00:08:39,900
Katayama Shingo

191
00:08:24,160 --> 00:08:25,960
Yeah he does

192
00:08:26,160 --> 00:08:28,820
He bought that at Shibuya 109

193
00:08:28,960 --> 00:08:30,140
No way...

194
00:08:29,700 --> 00:08:31,100
Ah is that so?

195
00:08:31,100 --> 00:08:32,300
Really?

196
00:08:31,780 --> 00:08:32,860
No no Tanaka

197
00:08:32,860 --> 00:08:34,120
That's-

198
00:08:34,120 --> 00:08:35,440
Tanaka it's true

199
00:08:35,440 --> 00:08:39,000
Who cares about that? Where he bought it...

200
00:08:40,100 --> 00:08:46,900
Katayama Shingo bought his hat at Shibuya 109

201
00:08:40,260 --> 00:08:41,480
Oh I got it!

202
00:08:40,580 --> 00:08:42,280
Oh we can say stuff like that?

203
00:08:41,500 --> 00:08:43,480
I see

204
00:08:43,480 --> 00:08:44,960
I'm feeling good

205
00:08:44,200 --> 00:08:46,880
A good pace now

206
00:08:45,320 --> 00:08:46,860
Yeah

207
00:08:47,080 --> 00:08:50,260
There was a marathon being run just now right?

208
00:08:50,260 --> 00:08:54,020
The reason marathons are 42.195km is,

209
00:08:54,020 --> 00:08:59,460
A soldier ran for 42.195km,

210
00:09:00,140 --> 00:09:07,860
Marathon triva

211
00:09:00,140 --> 00:09:07,860
Marathons are 40km long because of the fable of Pheidippides

212
00:09:00,700 --> 00:09:01,960
Ah I'm wrong?

213
00:09:01,960 --> 00:09:02,800
I guess so

214
00:09:02,800 --> 00:09:06,880
Something similiar to that, you remember CDs?

215
00:09:07,200 --> 00:09:09,540
They're 72 minutes long

216
00:09:10,740 --> 00:09:13,100
The reason being,

217
00:09:13,360 --> 00:09:18,040
When they were making CDs, they were thinking how many minutes it should hold,

218
00:09:18,040 --> 00:09:21,720
They decided it must hold the 9th Symphony

219
00:09:22,540 --> 00:09:24,980
Ah, it's the length of the 9th Symphony?

220
00:09:23,920 --> 00:09:26,440
It's the length of the 9th Symphony, 72 minutes

221
00:09:28,420 --> 00:09:29,720
There's an am/pm there

222
00:09:29,720 --> 00:09:30,600
Oh yeah there is

223
00:09:30,600 --> 00:09:32,740
Could you wait for my "ping-pong" chyme?

224
00:09:32,860 --> 00:09:44,980
CDs can hold 74 minutes of music because of the 9th symphony

225
00:09:32,860 --> 00:09:44,980
In fact...

226
00:09:33,460 --> 00:09:35,420
And I'm wrong too?!

227
00:09:35,420 --> 00:09:36,760
You got it wrong!

228
00:09:36,760 --> 00:09:39,720
That was wrong? It felt nice to hear though

229
00:09:39,720 --> 00:09:41,200
This is embarrassing

230
00:09:41,880 --> 00:09:43,720
I thought it was so interesting

231
00:09:45,220 --> 00:09:48,540
We haven't driven that far yet, but we've got a lot

232
00:09:46,260 --> 00:09:51,100
Trivia Count 9

233
00:09:47,900 --> 00:09:51,140
Yeah, we're making good pace

234
00:09:51,920 --> 00:09:54,540
Could you tell us the am/pm trivia?

235
00:09:53,420 --> 00:09:54,540
Ah am/pm?

236
00:09:54,540 --> 00:09:57,340
I did a commercial for them

237
00:09:58,200 --> 00:10:00,860
Yes, you did

238
00:10:00,880 --> 00:10:04,440
Of course that one doesn't count!

239
00:10:02,300 --> 00:10:03,740
Yeah...

240
00:10:03,740 --> 00:10:05,040
We're at Gotanda

241
00:10:05,040 --> 00:10:05,960
Gotanda?

242
00:10:05,960 --> 00:10:08,460
There's a lot of billboards here

243
00:10:09,260 --> 00:10:11,580
Behind the behind of that building,

244
00:10:11,580 --> 00:10:14,960
Hide from Penalty has a brewery back there

245
00:10:11,760 --> 00:10:13,740
TN: Might have got this one wrong

246
00:10:14,060 --> 00:10:15,180
It's a pub isn't it?

247
00:10:15,280 --> 00:10:17,020
Why would it be a brewery?

248
00:10:17,580 --> 00:10:25,460
Hide's Shop

249
00:10:17,980 --> 00:10:21,380
It's not even trivia, let alone correct

250
00:10:21,080 --> 00:10:22,660
Yeah honestly

251
00:10:22,060 --> 00:10:25,180
And it's not even behind there

252
00:10:25,460 --> 00:10:28,620
Is that thing about National Route 1 true?

253
00:10:27,120 --> 00:10:29,420
I thought it was the first road made

254
00:10:28,620 --> 00:10:30,120
They call it Route 1,

255
00:10:30,260 --> 00:10:33,480
Cause it's the most important route,

256
00:10:33,480 --> 00:10:35,620
The first road that comes to mind

257
00:10:36,940 --> 00:10:40,840
They say during the war, the used this road as a runway

258
00:10:40,980 --> 00:10:43,780
Apparently they landed planes here

259
00:10:46,540 --> 00:10:47,720
Verifying

260
00:10:48,200 --> 00:10:49,280
Ah, verifying?

261
00:10:49,280 --> 00:10:50,680
Verifying...

262
00:10:51,100 --> 00:10:57,420
The outside voice will announce after confirming

263
00:10:57,420 --> 00:11:01,100
If we don't get a 100 quickly, we'll end up leaving the city

264
00:10:59,880 --> 00:11:01,100
Oh yeah

265
00:11:01,100 --> 00:11:03,560
It'll make it harder for us

266
00:11:02,520 --> 00:11:03,900
Yeah

267
00:11:04,040 --> 00:11:06,220
And it'll take time to get back

268
00:11:05,340 --> 00:11:06,540
That's true

269
00:11:06,620 --> 00:11:08,600
In fact we've passed Kannama already

270
00:11:08,780 --> 00:11:10,380
That was quick

271
00:11:11,760 --> 00:11:14,380
There's gotta be something here

272
00:11:14,380 --> 00:11:17,780
Hmm, it seems like there isn't!

273
00:11:19,320 --> 00:11:22,120
It's too soon to say that!

274
00:11:23,040 --> 00:11:24,860
Sake... There's a Sake shop there

275
00:11:24,360 --> 00:11:26,140
Sake...

276
00:11:24,860 --> 00:11:28,300
There's gotta be something about alcohol

277
00:11:28,580 --> 00:11:30,800
Whisky...

278
00:11:31,660 --> 00:11:34,380
Whisky has no purine content

279
00:11:35,300 --> 00:11:44,780
Whisky does not contain purines

280
00:11:35,440 --> 00:11:36,940
What are purines anyways?

281
00:11:36,940 --> 00:11:38,460
No clue

282
00:11:41,020 --> 00:11:42,900
You just wanted to say that

283
00:11:42,900 --> 00:11:44,780
I don't know what I don't know

284
00:11:45,040 --> 00:11:48,880
I just know quite well that whisky doesn't have them

285
00:11:49,720 --> 00:11:50,880
That's all

286
00:11:53,140 --> 00:11:55,220
The trivia about highway runways,

287
00:11:55,880 --> 00:11:57,280
Is incorrect

288
00:11:56,420 --> 00:12:06,860
There is no proof that National Route 1 was used as a runway

289
00:11:57,700 --> 00:11:59,460
Ah, it's wrong...

290
00:11:58,600 --> 00:12:00,440
I was wrong?

291
00:12:00,760 --> 00:12:02,060
Magome...

292
00:12:02,200 --> 00:12:04,100
Something about the station?

293
00:12:04,100 --> 00:12:05,660
There must be something

294
00:12:06,020 --> 00:12:07,800
Magome Station...

295
00:12:08,580 --> 00:12:10,000
There's gotta be...

296
00:12:10,180 --> 00:12:16,700
How about this - The CEO of BOOK-OFF is the older sister of Shimuzu-san from Anonenone

297
00:12:18,680 --> 00:12:21,020
Ah that's why he was in the commercials?

298
00:12:20,420 --> 00:12:21,960
Yes yes

299
00:12:21,380 --> 00:12:22,680
A heavy user

300
00:12:24,900 --> 00:12:28,600
It makes you wonder "How does he even know that?"

301
00:12:24,980 --> 00:12:32,860
The CEO of BOOK-OFF is the older sister of Shimizu-san from Anonenone

302
00:12:28,600 --> 00:12:31,220
That's true, like the 7/11 thing

303
00:12:31,860 --> 00:12:33,660
Yeah, probably,

304
00:12:33,660 --> 00:12:35,620
He knows a lot of CEOs

305
00:12:35,020 --> 00:12:36,660
Why would I?!

306
00:12:36,060 --> 00:12:37,520
He knows about businesses

307
00:12:37,520 --> 00:12:39,220
Why would I?

308
00:12:39,220 --> 00:12:40,540
There's a lot here

309
00:12:40,540 --> 00:12:42,440
That roller bag was popular before

310
00:12:42,440 --> 00:12:45,080
Everyone used to have one

311
00:12:45,360 --> 00:12:50,380
In the past, roller bags could only roll along one axis right?

312
00:12:50,480 --> 00:12:52,640
The bag could only go back or forth

313
00:12:52,640 --> 00:12:56,020
It's confusing how you said bag and back there...

314
00:12:56,220 --> 00:13:01,340
But roller bags these days can go in many directions ... It's convenient

315
00:13:01,900 --> 00:13:03,100
No shit!

316
00:13:04,780 --> 00:13:09,100
They start to run out of trivia...

317
00:13:05,120 --> 00:13:06,600
50 minutes since the start

318
00:13:06,780 --> 00:13:08,880
They start to run out of trivia

319
00:13:09,420 --> 00:13:15,100
In this pinch, one man will save the day by opening his mouth

320
00:13:15,660 --> 00:13:21,080
I just saw a Condor Taxi pass by,

321
00:13:19,380 --> 00:13:20,820
Oh yeah

322
00:13:21,440 --> 00:13:23,620
So a trivia about Condors

323
00:13:22,780 --> 00:13:24,100
There it is, the animal trivia

324
00:13:24,100 --> 00:13:25,480
This is his strength

325
00:13:25,660 --> 00:13:27,240
Condors...

326
00:13:27,620 --> 00:13:30,600
This feels kind of forced though

327
00:13:30,980 --> 00:13:32,580
There really was a Condor Taxi!

328
00:13:32,580 --> 00:13:38,220
Condor have no feathers on their head and neck

329
00:13:38,220 --> 00:13:42,540
And the reason why they're bald there,

330
00:13:42,660 --> 00:13:48,020
They eat raw dead animals right?

331
00:13:48,020 --> 00:13:49,540
To eat meat,

332
00:13:49,540 --> 00:13:54,260
They stick their head in and dig in

333
00:13:54,260 --> 00:13:57,180
When they do that, the blood

334
00:13:57,460 --> 00:13:59,620
The blood gets on their head

335
00:13:59,620 --> 00:14:01,760
It sticks to their face

336
00:14:00,100 --> 00:14:04,200
It sticks to their face,

337
00:14:04,200 --> 00:14:05,620
I see

338
00:14:04,300 --> 00:14:08,220
If  they had feathers, the blood would stick and give them diseases

339
00:14:08,240 --> 00:14:11,960
So that's why they're bald there, so the sun can hit their skin

340
00:14:11,960 --> 00:14:16,460
And they can keep clean. That's why there's no feathers there.

341
00:14:16,460 --> 00:14:17,500
I see

342
00:14:19,180 --> 00:14:24,900
Condors have bald heads for sanitary reasons

343
00:14:19,820 --> 00:14:21,020
That's amazing!

344
00:14:21,020 --> 00:14:22,580
That's amazing

345
00:14:21,780 --> 00:14:24,580
It's a very gruesome story though

346
00:14:25,360 --> 00:14:27,020
Still 1/4 huh?

347
00:14:27,360 --> 00:14:29,200
A crow flew past just now-

348
00:14:29,200 --> 00:14:32,060
No it didn't!

349
00:14:32,060 --> 00:14:33,080
A crow-

350
00:14:32,280 --> 00:14:34,500
There was no crow

351
00:14:34,500 --> 00:14:36,440
The Condor Taxi was a lie for sure

352
00:14:38,340 --> 00:14:41,200
There was a taxi, to our right!

353
00:14:42,500 --> 00:14:45,460
Crows can manipulate around 40 words

354
00:14:45,940 --> 00:14:47,560
What do you mean "manipulate"?

355
00:14:47,560 --> 00:14:49,580
They can remember 40 words

356
00:14:48,780 --> 00:14:51,320
You're the one speaking in broken Japanese!

357
00:14:51,320 --> 00:14:52,940
With your 40 words

358
00:14:53,940 --> 00:14:55,060
In their language?

359
00:14:55,060 --> 00:14:57,240
They can communicate with their caws

360
00:14:57,240 --> 00:14:58,420
With each other?

361
00:14:57,780 --> 00:15:00,180
With each other

362
00:15:00,520 --> 00:15:01,920
Wow really?

363
00:15:00,940 --> 00:15:05,620
Crows have around 40 words in their vocabulary

364
00:15:03,740 --> 00:15:06,520
There's gotta be something about bowling

365
00:15:05,220 --> 00:15:06,440
Ah bowling?

366
00:15:07,040 --> 00:15:09,180
Bowling,

367
00:15:09,180 --> 00:15:13,320
What do they call it when you get 3 strikes in a row?

368
00:15:13,320 --> 00:15:14,480
Turkey

369
00:15:13,680 --> 00:15:15,440
Do you know why?

370
00:15:15,860 --> 00:15:17,960
Turkey is that bird right?

371
00:15:17,160 --> 00:15:17,960
Yeah

372
00:15:17,960 --> 00:15:21,220
In America when bowling first started,

373
00:15:21,220 --> 00:15:26,000
It was rather difficult to get multiple strikes,

374
00:15:26,240 --> 00:15:30,440
So some representative decided to create a present

375
00:15:30,440 --> 00:15:36,520
Coincidentally, really coincidentally, they decided to give out a turkey if you got 3 strikes in a row

376
00:15:36,520 --> 00:15:39,100
So that caught on with young people,

377
00:15:39,360 --> 00:15:44,820
When people would get 2 strikes in a row, they would say "If you get another strike, that's a Turkey!"

378
00:15:44,820 --> 00:15:46,340
Ahhh, I see

379
00:15:48,380 --> 00:15:50,780
That felt good

380
00:15:48,620 --> 00:15:56,460
If you got 3 stirkes in a row,
you would be awarded a turkey as a present

381
00:15:48,620 --> 00:15:56,460
The origin of "Turkey"

382
00:15:50,780 --> 00:15:52,240
Feels great

383
00:15:52,300 --> 00:15:56,460
Golf has that "Eagle" thing too right?

384
00:15:55,320 --> 00:15:56,280
It does

385
00:15:56,460 --> 00:16:01,440
Hmm, I think Endo would know this too, why Golf has 18 holes,

386
00:16:01,440 --> 00:16:02,580
Oh yeah, 18 holes

387
00:16:02,580 --> 00:16:04,940
The UK is a cold country right?

388
00:16:04,940 --> 00:16:08,240
So they would drink a flask of Scotch as they played

389
00:16:08,240 --> 00:16:14,100
And they would drink each time they cleared a hole, warming their bodies as they played,

390
00:16:14,240 --> 00:16:17,720
And right around the 18th hole their bodies would feel warmed up

391
00:16:17,720 --> 00:16:18,960
Ah, they finished drinking?

392
00:16:18,360 --> 00:16:19,580
Yes yes

393
00:16:20,660 --> 00:16:32,100
Golf's 18 holes;

394
00:16:20,660 --> 00:16:32,100
The bottle of scotch would finish by the 18th hole

395
00:16:21,360 --> 00:16:24,380
It would've been so funny if you got the buzzer there

396
00:16:24,380 --> 00:16:26,140
Endo, you knew that too right?

397
00:16:25,340 --> 00:16:26,680
Yes

398
00:16:26,920 --> 00:16:30,500
Ah, we're about to enter Kanagawa soon

399
00:16:30,500 --> 00:16:32,160
Ahhh Kanagawa

400
00:16:32,260 --> 00:16:35,200
There'll be less stores to point out too

401
00:16:35,200 --> 00:16:36,700
Yeah you're right

402
00:16:38,020 --> 00:16:47,580
They enter Kanagawa Prefecture

403
00:16:38,280 --> 00:16:40,320
1 hour from the start,

404
00:16:40,320 --> 00:16:44,440
The Trivia Drive leaves the city and enters Kanagawa

405
00:16:45,480 --> 00:16:47,320
And then,

406
00:16:48,140 --> 00:16:49,840
I need a pee

407
00:16:49,840 --> 00:16:51,860
Yeah a pee...

408
00:16:51,860 --> 00:16:54,080
I've been drinking a lot of water

409
00:16:54,280 --> 00:16:57,580
Yeah, that makes sense

410
00:16:58,740 --> 00:17:02,040
We've been driving the whole time of course,

411
00:17:02,260 --> 00:17:05,560
We've gotta pee of course, drink things of course,

412
00:17:05,560 --> 00:17:07,560
We're not robots after all

413
00:17:09,220 --> 00:17:11,180
They should play the "pin pon" noise there!

414
00:17:13,320 --> 00:17:14,220
Yeah!

415
00:17:14,220 --> 00:17:15,620
Yeah honestly

416
00:17:14,620 --> 00:17:16,060
There's a GUST there

417
00:17:16,060 --> 00:17:17,940
Let's go to GUST

418
00:17:18,420 --> 00:17:19,640
I might eat something

419
00:17:19,740 --> 00:17:22,720
The 5 take a break at GUST

420
00:17:23,380 --> 00:17:28,340
With Cocoroico in the lead, they've accumulated 33 trivia so far!

421
00:17:29,360 --> 00:17:34,700
Although this is a break, since they want to finish soon, this is also an opportunity to accumulate trivia

422
00:17:45,220 --> 00:17:48,840
The 5 order whatever they want

423
00:17:49,720 --> 00:17:51,320
1 Iced Coffee

424
00:17:51,580 --> 00:17:53,660
Would you like to use the drink bar?

425
00:17:53,660 --> 00:17:55,960
Is it more beneficial to go and get it?

426
00:17:56,380 --> 00:17:58,140
If you'd like to yes

427
00:17:58,140 --> 00:17:59,760
You...

428
00:17:59,760 --> 00:18:01,880
All you care about is benefits

429
00:18:02,680 --> 00:18:03,860
C'mon!

430
00:18:04,800 --> 00:18:06,460
The drink bar is out there

431
00:18:06,460 --> 00:18:07,800
Alright, understood

432
00:18:07,800 --> 00:18:08,820
Should we go ?

433
00:18:09,320 --> 00:18:10,720
Go get them

434
00:18:09,920 --> 00:18:11,040
I will

435
00:18:11,140 --> 00:18:12,840
I want, a hot tea

436
00:18:13,340 --> 00:18:14,640
Hot tea?

437
00:18:14,800 --> 00:18:16,160
Hot tea?

438
00:18:15,240 --> 00:18:17,940
I want a hot drink after my meal

439
00:18:18,500 --> 00:18:20,420
So you don't want one now!

440
00:18:21,080 --> 00:18:23,320
GUST huh?

441
00:18:23,740 --> 00:18:25,880
I'll go get the drinks too

442
00:18:24,740 --> 00:18:25,700
Really?

443
00:18:26,740 --> 00:18:28,360
I need to take a piss though

444
00:18:28,500 --> 00:18:30,320
You two get along please

445
00:18:31,600 --> 00:18:35,320
They can't just leave us alone like that

446
00:18:40,140 --> 00:18:41,840
Yeah...

447
00:18:48,500 --> 00:18:51,880
Our plan to leave DownTown alone with each other was a success

448
00:18:51,880 --> 00:18:52,940
Nice!

449
00:18:52,940 --> 00:18:54,100
We succeeded didn't we?

450
00:18:54,100 --> 00:18:55,560
Well done Big Bro

451
00:18:54,560 --> 00:18:56,400
Alone for the first time in a while

452
00:19:10,600 --> 00:19:13,980
What the hell have you been filming all this time?

453
00:19:16,540 --> 00:19:20,020
3 minutes later

454
00:19:22,540 --> 00:19:24,320
You took your time on purpose right?

455
00:19:23,620 --> 00:19:26,620
No no no no

456
00:19:26,940 --> 00:19:29,960
They only had hot drinks

457
00:19:27,880 --> 00:19:30,480
So we put ice in it

458
00:19:28,880 --> 00:19:30,680
Seriously?

459
00:19:30,900 --> 00:19:33,820
The reason I wanted ice coffee,

460
00:19:34,340 --> 00:19:36,460
Was to cool down my body,

461
00:19:36,460 --> 00:19:42,380
But originally in South America, in those hot countries, they started drinking coffee because it cools down the body

462
00:19:43,000 --> 00:19:44,480
Ehhh

463
00:19:44,980 --> 00:19:50,740
Coffee has a cooling effect on the body

464
00:19:46,860 --> 00:19:48,720
There it is

465
00:19:49,040 --> 00:19:50,760
Going off that,

466
00:19:50,760 --> 00:19:54,480
You'd think they drink Oolong tea in China right?

467
00:19:54,580 --> 00:19:58,660
But recently they've been drinking more Coffee

468
00:19:58,040 --> 00:19:59,480
Oh really?

469
00:19:58,660 --> 00:20:06,160
In fact this might have resulted in the cultivation of coffee beans surpassing the cultivation of tea leaves

470
00:20:06,400 --> 00:20:08,080
Eh?

471
00:20:11,460 --> 00:20:13,740
No no, even if you make that face...

472
00:20:14,420 --> 00:20:16,980
Waiting for the pin pon sound

473
00:20:15,600 --> 00:20:18,020
- I have no idea though!

474
00:20:18,560 --> 00:20:19,680
He ran away

475
00:20:19,940 --> 00:20:21,160
Here it is

476
00:20:22,860 --> 00:20:24,380
Ah, excuse me

477
00:20:26,660 --> 00:20:27,880
This is that thing,

478
00:20:34,120 --> 00:20:36,420
It's a birthday!

479
00:20:35,620 --> 00:20:37,200
Yeah

480
00:20:37,760 --> 00:20:39,400
Speaking of birthdays,

481
00:20:39,400 --> 00:20:43,660
Nagashima Shigeo (baseball player), Antonio Inoki, and Shimura Ken share the same birthday

482
00:20:45,860 --> 00:20:49,740
They were all born February 20th

483
00:20:46,900 --> 00:20:49,300
That's cool though

484
00:20:49,500 --> 00:20:51,660
That's amazing

485
00:20:53,660 --> 00:20:56,730
Did we pass by a Bikkuri Donkey?

486
00:20:56,730 --> 00:20:58,500
We probably did

487
00:20:58,500 --> 00:21:05,000
Incidentally, houses that look like Bikkuri Donkey stores,

488
00:21:05,530 --> 00:21:10,330
Amagasaki had a lot of them

489
00:21:13,060 --> 00:21:17,980
After this

490
00:21:13,060 --> 00:21:17,980
Once again, DownTown are...

491
00:21:20,420 --> 00:21:23,530
Chicken,

492
00:21:23,660 --> 00:21:28,000
These days young girls have bigger breasts

493
00:21:30,030 --> 00:21:32,330
They say it's because of eating chicken

494
00:21:32,500 --> 00:21:34,000
Why?

495
00:21:33,200 --> 00:21:35,660
They say the food they feed Chickens

496
00:21:35,660 --> 00:21:38,930
Contains things that increase breast size

497
00:21:39,960 --> 00:21:41,600
That's correct?!

498
00:21:40,380 --> 00:21:47,620
Chicken is an effective food source for increasing breast size

499
00:21:44,360 --> 00:21:47,630
Even outside of the lactation period,

500
00:21:47,630 --> 00:21:52,660
Humans have enlarged breasts, which is unique among mammals

501
00:21:53,000 --> 00:21:58,300
For animals, it's important to be able to reproduce right?

502
00:21:58,530 --> 00:22:02,630
Other mammals walk on all fours,

503
00:22:03,060 --> 00:22:06,600
So the rear end of the female is within their eyesight

504
00:22:06,900 --> 00:22:10,330
So they can see the female's buttocks,

505
00:22:10,330 --> 00:22:14,860
and it serves as a sexual signal, that makes them want to reproduce

506
00:22:14,860 --> 00:22:20,430
But since humans are bipedal, in order to have "buttocks" in our view,

507
00:22:20,430 --> 00:22:25,300
Human females have enlarged breasts to simulate them

508
00:22:25,300 --> 00:22:26,860
That's amazing

509
00:22:26,260 --> 00:22:28,360
Isn't that amazing?

510
00:22:28,500 --> 00:22:32,940
Human females have enlarged breasts to substitute for buttocks

511
00:22:30,760 --> 00:22:37,460
That reminds me, Yamasaki-san is forcefully suppressing his libido right now,

512
00:22:37,830 --> 00:22:42,160
So while in line at the bank, he almost jumped at an old lady's ass

513
00:22:42,960 --> 00:22:46,160
Buzzer! Buzzer sound!

514
00:22:46,160 --> 00:22:49,820
I didn't know that, that's new trivia to me

515
00:22:49,820 --> 00:22:52,200
Tanaka it's a good time for coffee right?

516
00:22:52,200 --> 00:22:54,700
Ah, after the meal

517
00:22:54,700 --> 00:22:56,180
Let's go then Tanaka

518
00:22:56,180 --> 00:22:57,960
Let's go

519
00:23:00,630 --> 00:23:02,800
Is this funny?

520
00:23:04,430 --> 00:23:06,160
Is this funny?

521
00:23:06,360 --> 00:23:08,100
Idiots

522
00:23:08,860 --> 00:23:11,930
What was the issue Endo had? Gallstones?

523
00:23:12,760 --> 00:23:18,730
Incidentally, if you eat too much of this [REDACTED], you'll end up with that issue as well

524
00:23:19,340 --> 00:23:22,140
Food Product

525
00:23:22,140 --> 00:23:29,820
Food Product

526
00:23:28,100 --> 00:23:32,580
Pin Pon!

527
00:23:33,500 --> 00:23:36,660
No no no, that's not right

528
00:23:37,230 --> 00:23:38,960
It's not?

529
00:23:37,760 --> 00:23:40,660
It's just someone coming inside!

530
00:23:41,220 --> 00:23:44,160
They say men think of sex every 4 minutes

531
00:23:44,400 --> 00:23:47,600
Next Week - Trivia Drive Finale

532
00:23:47,800 --> 00:23:51,230
To think of more trivia, they head to Yokohama Chinatown

533
00:23:51,230 --> 00:23:55,030
****** can now speak Japanese properly

534
00:23:56,560 --> 00:23:59,530
And the drive continues into the night

535
00:23:59,860 --> 00:24:01,830
I DON'T wanna go there

536
00:24:00,830 --> 00:24:04,130
Will they be able to accumulate 100 trivia?

537
00:24:04,420 --> 00:24:12,530
