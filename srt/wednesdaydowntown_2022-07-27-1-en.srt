00:00:02,960 --> 00:00:04,790
Welcome to Wednesday Downtown,

2
00:00:07,490 --> 00:00:10,110
Letâ€™s get on with our first presenter please

3
00:00:13,280 --> 00:00:16,980
It's Viking's Kotouge!

4
00:00:16,980 --> 00:00:20,920
Isn't it everyone's favorite Kotou-chan?

5
00:00:20,920 --> 00:00:22,770
You are very kind

6
00:00:22,770 --> 00:00:25,130
The whole of Japan's favorite Kotou-chan
-No no no

7
00:00:25,130 --> 00:00:28,270
Old women still don't like me very much

8
00:00:28,270 --> 00:00:29,580
What about Ani-chan?

9
00:00:29,580 --> 00:00:33,110
You are the only one who would mention this person

10
00:00:33,110 --> 00:00:34,290
Ani-chan?

11
00:00:34,290 --> 00:00:38,070
My eardrums haven't heard that name in a long time

12
00:00:38,070 --> 00:00:39,320
Very nostalgic

13
00:00:39,320 --> 00:00:41,810
Since she got married
-After all, she's married

14
00:00:42,680 --> 00:00:46,520
This time I've brought this theory:

15
00:00:47,420 --> 00:00:54,360
The 5th Comedians' Funniest Moments

16
00:00:55,300 --> 00:00:57,170
It's funny.
-It's great

17
00:00:57,170 --> 00:00:59,170
The last time I presented something for this theory

18
00:00:59,170 --> 00:01:03,540
Mouchu Gakusei performing on stage

19
00:01:03,550 --> 00:01:06,200
Originally it was a segment that was supposed to be in front of an audience

20
00:01:06,200 --> 00:01:08,410
But he ended up doing it in an empty room

21
00:01:09,440 --> 00:01:11,860
The only sound in the room was his sneakers scraping on the floor

22
00:01:11,860 --> 00:01:14,460
Squeaky

23
00:01:14,450 --> 00:01:16,860
This kind of mental quality is also very rare in the world of comedians

24
00:01:16,860 --> 00:01:18,960
So it was very interesting.
-Yes

25
00:01:18,960 --> 00:01:21,830
But since that episode aired, it has become a hit again.
-Yes

26
00:01:21,830 --> 00:01:25,620
Thanks to your introduction

27
00:01:25,620 --> 00:01:27,910
He has been able to increase his popularity again

28
00:01:29,980 --> 00:01:33,500
Perhaps many staff members involved watched that episode

29
00:01:33,520 --> 00:01:40,160
So maybe comedians can take advantage of this opportunity to become more popular

30
00:01:40,160 --> 00:01:42,540
It's hard to say.
-We don't know yet

31
00:01:42,540 --> 00:01:46,560
Straight away you're being difficult

32
00:01:46,560 --> 00:01:49,650
It's not impossible
-Indeed

33
00:01:49,650 --> 00:01:51,090
So maybe a comedian will have such an opportunity

34
00:01:51,090 --> 00:01:52,520
It's hard to say, isn't it?

35
00:01:52,520 --> 00:01:55,870
You don't know, so don't be so pessimistic!

36
00:02:11,520 --> 00:02:19,520
The 5th Comedians' Funniest Moments

37
00:02:20,160 --> 00:02:26,530
First is Shimofuri Myojo's Soshina

38
00:02:26,530 --> 00:02:30,830
"Iroha ni Chidori" on Saitama TV last year

39
00:02:31,030 --> 00:02:33,060
This is a program hosted by Chidori

40
00:02:33,670 --> 00:02:36,130
Guests include 5GAP

41
00:02:36,130 --> 00:02:39,200
At that time, there was a project called QUIZ 5GAP

42
00:02:39,200 --> 00:02:43,780
Chidori watch half of 5GAP skit

43
00:02:43,780 --> 00:02:45,680
Then Daigo and Nobu guess the rest of it

44
00:02:45,680 --> 00:02:49,150
"What jokes will be made"

45
00:02:49,150 --> 00:02:52,640
They guess and then the answer is revealed

46
00:02:53,350 --> 00:02:56,190
QUIZ 5GAP Questions

47
00:02:56,190 --> 00:02:59,010
Including this photo itself is already very funny

48
00:02:59,010 --> 00:03:02,770
Next up is the Heavyweight Wrestling Championship

49
00:03:02,770 --> 00:03:05,080
First, the challenger from the red side

50
00:03:05,080 --> 00:03:09,330
The enigmatic masked wrestler Red Dragon

51
00:03:16,140 --> 00:03:20,040
5GAP, what will be the next joke?

52
00:03:20,040 --> 00:03:21,600
This is how it goes

53
00:03:22,480 --> 00:03:23,490
The introduction says Red Dragon

54
00:03:23,490 --> 00:03:26,010
But the guy who comes out is wearing blue clothes

55
00:03:27,910 --> 00:03:29,760
It is indeed very much like the style of 5GAP

56
00:03:30,320 --> 00:03:33,460
Said it was Red Dragon, but he's actually blue

57
00:03:33,460 --> 00:03:37,640
In 5GAP's style it should be very funny

58
00:03:37,640 --> 00:03:39,920
If he comes out in blue

59
00:03:39,920 --> 00:03:41,880
If so then red should be emphasized more at the start

60
00:03:43,040 --> 00:03:45,290
Say Super Red or something

61
00:03:45,290 --> 00:03:46,800
Since he's talking about Red Dragon

62
00:03:46,800 --> 00:03:48,560
So I think it wont go this way

63
00:03:48,560 --> 00:03:53,390
In that case, the important point is the "enigmatic masked wrestler"

64
00:03:49,510 --> 00:03:51,040
Both of them are very serious

65
00:03:56,490 --> 00:03:57,610
This point

66
00:03:57,610 --> 00:03:59,390
Although it is called "masked wrestler"

67
00:03:59,390 --> 00:04:01,430
His face is actually showing

68
00:04:01,430 --> 00:04:03,430
Not even masked

69
00:04:04,210 --> 00:04:05,890
Both predictions are very serious

70
00:04:05,420 --> 00:04:07,720
They have a mask, but the face is completely exposed

71
00:04:06,730 --> 00:04:08,830
Thinking very hard

72
00:04:08,830 --> 00:04:14,470
When seeing the correct answer I couldn't help but laugh

73
00:04:15,060 --> 00:04:19,170
The correct answer to this QUIZ 5GAP is as follows

74
00:04:20,200 --> 00:04:24,410
Next up is the Heavyweight Wrestling Championship

75
00:04:24,950 --> 00:04:27,300
First, the challenger from the red side

76
00:04:27,300 --> 00:04:31,760
The enigmatic masked wrestler Red Dragon

77
00:04:34,030 --> 00:04:36,720
I think it's the face

78
00:04:41,810 --> 00:04:43,230
Both right!

79
00:04:45,630 --> 00:04:46,860
No creative secrets to speak of

80
00:04:48,240 --> 00:04:50,560
We were both right

81
00:04:50,560 --> 00:04:52,180
This is awesome!

82
00:04:52,650 --> 00:04:55,210
Blue and not masked

83
00:04:53,580 --> 00:04:55,210
Correct

84
00:04:57,960 --> 00:04:59,490
Seen through their work too easily

85
00:04:59,490 --> 00:05:03,570
I didn't expect both of them to be right

86
00:05:03,570 --> 00:05:05,650
And this kind of thing

87
00:05:08,950 --> 00:05:10,880
I laughed so hard, I laughed so hard

88
00:05:11,520 --> 00:05:12,820
It's a miracle

89
00:05:12,820 --> 00:05:15,330
It's also funny when he comes out with "Hey~"

90
00:05:17,760 --> 00:05:21,470
By the way, when Nobu was recording this episode

91
00:05:21,470 --> 00:05:25,770
He laughed too much, resulting in a lack of oxygen to the brain

92
00:05:25,770 --> 00:05:27,770
After the recording he was taken to hospital

93
00:05:27,770 --> 00:05:31,010
This is a legendary moment in the world of comedy

94
00:05:31,010 --> 00:05:33,690
He collapsed because he was laughing too much

95
00:05:33,690 --> 00:05:40,690
Next is Onigoe Tomahawk's Sakai

96
00:05:40,690 --> 00:05:45,790
A program called "THE OUTSIDER" hosted by Maeda Nikkei

97
00:05:45,790 --> 00:05:49,430
Gathering bad guys from all over Japan to fight

98
00:05:49,430 --> 00:05:52,800
An amateur mixed martial arts competition

99
00:05:52,800 --> 00:05:55,800
Is this comedy?
-Surely no comedy factor at all

100
00:05:55,800 --> 00:06:00,070
Everyone was very serious, obviously not a laughing matter

101
00:06:00,070 --> 00:06:03,700
But something funny happened surprisingly

102
00:06:03,700 --> 00:06:06,110
The level of "THE OUTSIDER" is now very high

103
00:06:06,110 --> 00:06:08,510
THE OUTSIDER" of more than 10 years ago

104
00:06:08,510 --> 00:06:13,150
It was just street punks who thought they could fight well

105
00:06:13,150 --> 00:06:15,690
It was a very rough

106
00:06:15,890 --> 00:06:18,760
In such a rough competition

107
00:06:18,760 --> 00:06:21,830
There was a contestant named Kuroishi Takahiro

108
00:06:22,330 --> 00:06:26,360
He came from a gang in Yokohama

109
00:06:26,360 --> 00:06:29,030
Seemed like a pretty bad guy

110
00:06:30,070 --> 00:06:33,440
The kind of punk that'd appear in a manga

111
00:06:33,440 --> 00:06:36,830
He had the vibe of "today we must fight to the death"

112
00:06:36,830 --> 00:06:41,650
There was a murderous aura in his eyes

113
00:06:41,650 --> 00:06:44,580
He had a match

114
00:06:44,580 --> 00:06:47,050
The "dang" gong sounded and the match began

115
00:06:47,050 --> 00:06:51,360
As soon as the gong sounded, Kuroishi rushed towards the other guy with all his strength

116
00:06:51,360 --> 00:06:53,660
I'd like you to see that scene

117
00:06:52,910 --> 00:06:55,420
Will this be funny?

118
00:06:53,890 --> 00:06:58,670
Kuroishi from Yokohama's moment is this

119
00:06:58,670 --> 00:07:04,340
Kuroishi

120
00:07:04,340 --> 00:07:07,610
A murderous look

121
00:07:07,810 --> 00:07:11,240
He has the momentum to rush forward with full force

122
00:07:13,440 --> 00:07:16,490
Round 1 Fight

123
00:07:16,170 --> 00:07:17,490
He's going to rush over

124
00:07:21,550 --> 00:07:22,900
1 hit? Eh?

125
00:07:24,720 --> 00:07:27,190
Out completely

126
00:07:25,680 --> 00:07:29,220
A one-hit KO

127
00:07:30,330 --> 00:07:32,830
As a result, members of their gang flew into the ring

128
00:07:32,830 --> 00:07:35,610
You have to say it's funny, right? These people...

129
00:07:35,670 --> 00:07:38,260
No one cares about Kuroishi

130
00:07:38,260 --> 00:07:41,110
Why did they all run in?
-No one did anything wrong

131
00:07:45,340 --> 00:07:50,390
They're all fighting each other now

132
00:07:49,510 --> 00:07:52,220
Kuroishi is completely confused

133
00:07:52,220 --> 00:07:54,220
No one cares about him

134
00:07:54,220 --> 00:07:56,190
"What's going on?" This feeling

135
00:07:54,930 --> 00:07:55,980
Doesn't get what's going on

136
00:07:55,980 --> 00:07:56,880
No memory at all

137
00:07:56,620 --> 00:07:59,060
Wasn't able to do anything

138
00:07:59,060 --> 00:08:00,990
There's always next time

139
00:08:01,260 --> 00:08:03,860
Kuroishi is crying.
-Must be very upset

140
00:08:04,760 --> 00:08:09,030
I really did not do anything and lost in two seconds

141
00:08:06,660 --> 00:08:10,160
Sakai, stop it.
-What a bad guy

142
00:08:09,200 --> 00:08:11,570
This is Kuroishi

143
00:08:11,570 --> 00:08:16,770
KO in the opening two seconds, this is something you can't do even if you want to

144
00:08:19,540 --> 00:08:21,720
That's enough

145
00:08:25,080 --> 00:08:28,060
And then his fellow gang members all rush in

146
00:08:28,060 --> 00:08:30,460
Then he regains consciousness and gets up again

147
00:08:30,460 --> 00:08:35,060
With this "Hey? What's going on?" look, its very interesting

148
00:08:35,060 --> 00:08:40,240
I think this is a famous scene that will go down in history

149
00:08:40,950 --> 00:08:45,360
This is Onigoe Tomahawk Sakai's funniest moment

150
00:08:45,360 --> 00:08:48,590
Kuroishi of THE OUTSIDER

151
00:08:49,610 --> 00:08:56,150
Next is Tokyo 03 Iizuka

152
00:08:56,150 --> 00:08:58,620
I saw it on TV last year

153
00:08:58,620 --> 00:09:03,490
Just after the M-1 Grand Prix

154
00:09:03,490 --> 00:09:06,690
Nishkikoi, the champions attended "Wide na Show"

155
00:09:07,330 --> 00:09:13,700
Hasegawa said he liked a certain joke of Matsumoto's

156
00:09:13,700 --> 00:09:19,540
He began tearfully talking about his state of mind

157
00:09:17,210 --> 00:09:19,810
I watched that too.
-Me too

158
00:09:19,900 --> 00:09:22,720
A feeling of mixed feelings

159
00:09:22,720 --> 00:09:26,480
When watching it I was also moved

160
00:09:26,480 --> 00:09:32,240
But when Hasegawa was about to finish

161
00:09:32,240 --> 00:09:35,850
Like a sudden awakening

162
00:09:35,850 --> 00:09:36,960
The tears were stopped at once

163
00:09:37,290 --> 00:09:38,890
Rather than stopping

164
00:09:39,290 --> 00:09:42,490
It's more like entering a state of no-self

165
00:09:42,860 --> 00:09:45,260
The feelings suddenly disappear

166
00:09:45,260 --> 00:09:48,600
As something else is said, the topic is finished

167
00:09:48,600 --> 00:09:50,470
Just this little bit

168
00:09:50,470 --> 00:09:53,900
But his enigmatic slowdown is particularly interesting

169
00:09:53,900 --> 00:09:56,570
I'm not sure what's interesting about this

170
00:09:56,570 --> 00:10:00,870
Its difficult to describe

171
00:10:01,400 --> 00:10:04,820
Please take a look

172
00:10:08,040 --> 00:10:10,880
Sorry, he's crying

173
00:10:10,880 --> 00:10:13,030
Matsumoto said...

174
00:10:13,030 --> 00:10:15,760
Very touching

175
00:10:15,470 --> 00:10:20,200
The phrase "the soul never grows old"

176
00:10:20,200 --> 00:10:22,760
I too...

177
00:10:24,350 --> 00:10:25,640
Like

178
00:10:27,710 --> 00:10:30,620
No, that's too weird.

179
00:10:30,540 --> 00:10:31,880
What's going on?

180
00:10:31,980 --> 00:10:32,740
Why suddenly stopped crying

181
00:10:32,740 --> 00:10:34,210
What really happened?

182
00:10:34,210 --> 00:10:38,950
It's been a long time since I've seen it, but it's still fun to watch now

183
00:10:38,950 --> 00:10:40,620
It's a mystery

184
00:10:42,720 --> 00:10:46,160
Obviously so full of feelings, feelings are almost pouring out

185
00:10:46,490 --> 00:10:49,730
So moved to cry

186
00:10:49,730 --> 00:10:51,500
Suddenly becomes expressionless

187
00:10:51,830 --> 00:10:55,770
It can't be performed

188
00:10:54,730 --> 00:10:56,730
It's not something that can be acted out

189
00:10:56,060 --> 00:10:58,030
This phrase I am too ...

190
00:11:02,750 --> 00:11:04,110
Like

191
00:11:04,910 --> 00:11:06,090
Scary

192
00:11:06,110 --> 00:11:12,680
Suddenly, he stopped crying and said "like"

193
00:11:10,690 --> 00:11:12,840
Another personality suddenly appears

194
00:11:13,210 --> 00:11:19,440
Next is Magical Lovely's Noda Crystal

195
00:11:19,690 --> 00:11:25,860
A fighting game tournament EVO2015

196
00:11:25,860 --> 00:11:29,030
It's like the olympics for fighting games

197
00:11:29,030 --> 00:11:33,360
This is for the game Guilty Gear Strive

198
00:11:33,360 --> 00:11:37,610
There was a match between Woshige and Ogawa

199
00:11:37,610 --> 00:11:40,680
It's a strong matchup

200
00:11:40,680 --> 00:11:42,410
They are very passionate about the game

201
00:11:42,410 --> 00:11:44,420
It's like a dream matchup

202
00:11:44,420 --> 00:11:48,250
This was considered to be the pinnacle

203
00:11:48,250 --> 00:11:50,800
But the ending of this game makes you think "Hey, really?"

204
00:11:51,020 --> 00:11:53,590
This kind of world competition is of great interest to people all over the world

205
00:11:53,590 --> 00:11:55,840
But everyone who saw this scene was dumbfounded

206
00:11:56,320 --> 00:11:58,970
This is the moment

207
00:11:58,970 --> 00:12:00,840
A very rare event

208
00:12:00,840 --> 00:12:06,800
Ogawa uses the character with blonde hair and sunglasses

209
00:12:06,800 --> 00:12:11,760
Woshige uses a female character with long blonde hair

210
00:12:13,480 --> 00:12:16,380
By this time, Ogawa had already won one round

211
00:12:16,380 --> 00:12:20,120
If Ogawa wins again in this round, he will win this match

212
00:12:20,120 --> 00:12:23,200
Both sides do not give way to each other, the physical strength is also an even match

213
00:12:23,200 --> 00:12:24,800
It seems he is going to be unable to hold out

214
00:12:26,130 --> 00:12:29,000
But then Woshige makes a big move that is sure to kill

215
00:12:32,060 --> 00:12:34,300
He got up and cheered, but the game wasn't over yet

216
00:12:34,300 --> 00:12:36,030
There was still one more round after that

217
00:12:36,030 --> 00:12:39,810
He suddenly remembers and rushes back to sit down

218
00:12:41,070 --> 00:12:43,170
But it's too late

219
00:12:45,340 --> 00:12:47,050
What is this?

220
00:12:51,600 --> 00:12:53,070
Probably forgot

221
00:12:53,070 --> 00:12:54,000
What is this?

222
00:12:54,000 --> 00:12:55,620
He's so happy

223
00:12:55,620 --> 00:12:59,230
Overjoyed to have scored a point

224
00:12:59,230 --> 00:13:00,620
Thought he had won

225
00:13:00,620 --> 00:13:01,980
Probably just thought it was over

226
00:13:01,980 --> 00:13:03,740
What is this?

227
00:13:06,260 --> 00:13:08,570
Ogawa has no human feelings

228
00:13:08,770 --> 00:13:10,470
What a vivid memory!

229
00:13:10,470 --> 00:13:13,340
Ogawa showed no mercy

230
00:13:13,340 --> 00:13:17,610
And regardless of that the opposite player hadn't started yet he just hammered away

231
00:13:17,610 --> 00:13:22,280
A historic one-sided beat-down

232
00:13:22,280 --> 00:13:25,250
This is too unreasonable, professional players should not make such cheap mistakes

233
00:13:25,250 --> 00:13:26,520
They've been through so many competitions before

234
00:13:26,520 --> 00:13:28,490
He ran 50 metres

235
00:13:28,490 --> 00:13:31,080
Just posed like this

236
00:13:32,820 --> 00:13:35,360
And was then reminded "you're not finished yet!"

237
00:13:36,930 --> 00:13:41,570
The foreign live commentary says "oh my god"

238
00:13:41,570 --> 00:13:44,050
So you can really say "oh my god" at this

239
00:13:44,200 --> 00:13:46,440
OH MY GOD

240
00:13:47,130 --> 00:13:50,070
This is Noda's funniest moment

241
00:13:50,070 --> 00:13:54,560
A premature victory pose

242
00:13:54,560 --> 00:13:56,130
Misunderstood

243
00:13:55,410 --> 00:13:57,880
OH MY GOD

244
00:13:58,550 --> 00:14:04,460
Next is Untouchable's Shibata

245
00:14:05,890 --> 00:14:08,630
This must have been more than 30 years ago

246
00:14:08,630 --> 00:14:10,660
ABC broadcast a show called

247
00:14:10,660 --> 00:14:14,930
Wakabushigi Downtown

248
00:14:14,930 --> 00:14:16,100
To say what sort of show it was...

249
00:14:16,100 --> 00:14:18,980
Downtown hosted with Imada and Higashino

250
00:14:18,980 --> 00:14:20,580
The Gottsu members

251
00:14:20,580 --> 00:14:28,840
The show involved physical reactions

252
00:14:29,150 --> 00:14:37,890
There was a time in this program when Honkon had mayonnaise squirted on his face

253
00:14:37,890 --> 00:14:39,760
This is a simple scene

254
00:14:40,190 --> 00:14:43,530
Balloons filled with mayonnaise

255
00:14:43,530 --> 00:14:47,000
The balloon broke and then the mayonnaise in the balloon spilled onto the face

256
00:14:47,000 --> 00:14:50,470
This scene was an earthquake level of amusement to me as a high school student at the time

257
00:14:51,040 --> 00:14:54,410
Let's take a look

258
00:15:00,330 --> 00:15:01,680
So young

259
00:15:05,880 --> 00:15:10,960
Itao slipped on the mayonnaise in the background

260
00:15:10,960 --> 00:15:12,320
The scene was chaos

261
00:15:12,320 --> 00:15:15,670
Itao getting in the way

262
00:15:22,390 --> 00:15:24,200
The spreading is also too perfect

263
00:15:28,470 --> 00:15:31,530
That's him.
-Honkon at first glance

264
00:15:31,530 --> 00:15:33,260
Even though the face is covered its so obvious its him

265
00:15:33,610 --> 00:15:36,950
How'd it spread like that?

266
00:15:37,950 --> 00:15:39,750
It's too perfect, right?

267
00:15:40,290 --> 00:15:44,450
It was as if this project was made for him

268
00:15:42,430 --> 00:15:44,450
Very impressive indeed

269
00:15:44,450 --> 00:15:45,790
This is too perfect

270
00:15:46,060 --> 00:15:48,900
There are all kinds of small accidents

271
00:15:48,900 --> 00:15:53,860
And the actual result is an added bonus of hilarity

272
00:15:54,490 --> 00:16:00,330
Next is Yahagi

273
00:16:01,110 --> 00:16:03,870
I saw it on TV about five years ago

274
00:16:03,870 --> 00:16:09,980
A program called "Tonight's Puzzle Training"

275
00:16:09,980 --> 00:16:15,580
There was a question to guess who someone in a costume was

276
00:16:16,020 --> 00:16:17,990
To guess

277
00:16:17,990 --> 00:16:25,400
They'd use the speaker commonly used in quiz shows

278
00:16:25,400 --> 00:16:27,970
Tell Ueda quietly, and he will then decide if the answer is correct

279
00:16:28,130 --> 00:16:34,800
At this point, Sunshine Ikezaki seems to have guessed correctly

280
00:16:34,800 --> 00:16:38,010
Usually you should speak very quietly through the speaker to say who it is

281
00:16:38,710 --> 00:16:45,420
But he shouted "YEAH" especially loudly through the loudspeaker

282
00:16:45,420 --> 00:16:46,950
While he was shouting "YEAH"

283
00:16:46,950 --> 00:16:54,230
Ueda beat him up with lightning speed

284
00:16:53,370 --> 00:16:56,380
Genuinely angry

285
00:16:54,230 --> 00:16:59,200
Seeing people angry can be funny

286
00:16:59,780 --> 00:17:04,210
The moment is this

287
00:17:04,210 --> 00:17:06,190
Sunshine's answer is

288
00:17:07,600 --> 00:17:10,050
YEAH
-What are you doing?

289
00:17:11,780 --> 00:17:13,660
It's too dangerous

290
00:17:12,540 --> 00:17:14,430
Idiot!

291
00:17:15,370 --> 00:17:16,710
Really angry

292
00:17:16,710 --> 00:17:18,450
Super quick to get angry

293
00:17:18,450 --> 00:17:19,630
The first hit was a real hit

294
00:17:19,630 --> 00:17:21,350
So fast!

295
00:17:25,060 --> 00:17:27,390
Next time i'll punch you

296
00:17:27,320 --> 00:17:29,660
His personal health is threatened

297
00:17:27,790 --> 00:17:29,650
That's funny

298
00:17:29,650 --> 00:17:31,960
Sunshine Ikezaki is also really good!

299
00:17:31,960 --> 00:17:35,330
I don't think anyone but him would dare to make that much noise

300
00:17:35,330 --> 00:17:38,300
Not in his right mind. Absolutely not

301
00:17:38,300 --> 00:17:39,940
It's really dangerous

302
00:17:39,940 --> 00:17:44,010
And Ueda is so quick to respond.

303
00:17:44,310 --> 00:17:47,780
Took less than a second to hit it

304
00:17:47,780 --> 00:17:52,080
If it was an ordinary "ah" it would not be so funny

305
00:17:52,490 --> 00:17:55,220
YEAH
-What are you doing?

306
00:17:57,250 --> 00:17:58,760
Idiot!

307
00:17:59,020 --> 00:18:02,360
Both are great

308
00:18:02,360 --> 00:18:04,630
No win or loss

309
00:18:05,200 --> 00:18:08,320
This is Yahagi's funniest moment

310
00:18:08,320 --> 00:18:13,380
Ikezaki, who was screaming in his ear, and Ueda, who was furious

311
00:18:18,580 --> 00:18:21,680
Ikezaki is scary!
-Really scary

312
00:18:21,680 --> 00:18:25,840
It was so close.
-Ueda felt the danger

313
00:18:25,840 --> 00:18:29,780
Couldn't suppress his anger
-Indeed

314
00:18:29,780 --> 00:18:31,360
Do you have a favorite moment?

315
00:18:31,360 --> 00:18:34,010
Hasegawa of Nishkikoi

316
00:18:34,010 --> 00:18:36,720
I can't believe his feelings changed so abruptly

317
00:18:36,720 --> 00:18:39,680
You were there, weren't you? What happened then?

318
00:18:39,680 --> 00:18:42,900
He wasn't really trying to be funny either

319
00:18:42,900 --> 00:18:47,440
It was as if his battery had suddenly been pulled out

320
00:18:47,440 --> 00:18:50,510
The line of emotion was broken with a click
-It was like that

321
00:18:50,510 --> 00:18:52,560
It's funny how many times you watch it.
-What do you think, Kawashima?

322
00:18:52,560 --> 00:18:55,920
If we're talking about moments, I think Shibata's

323
00:18:55,920 --> 00:19:00,280
The combination of Mayonnaise and Honkon is great
-What can I say about this?

324
00:19:00,280 --> 00:19:04,800
The shape is still obvious

325
00:19:04,800 --> 00:19:08,790
Like the state of a carving before it is finished

326
00:19:08,790 --> 00:19:10,400
What do you think, Michopa?

327
00:19:10,400 --> 00:19:13,980
I think QUIZ 5GAP one is quite interesting

328
00:19:14,670 --> 00:19:16,610
What kind of mindset do they have to answer this question?

329
00:19:16,610 --> 00:19:18,950
Indeed, the answer is correct

330
00:19:18,950 --> 00:19:20,780
They were so happy to hear the answer

331
00:19:20,780 --> 00:19:23,540
There is no contrast between prediction and reality

332
00:19:23,540 --> 00:19:25,900
There is no GAP
-0 GAP

333
00:19:25,900 --> 00:19:30,710
Will this one become popular?
-It's possible

334
00:19:30,710 --> 00:19:33,980
The guess was correct, that is to say, those two are stupid and too predictable

335
00:19:38,090 --> 00:19:40,990
Let's welcome the next presenter

336
00:19:45,850 --> 00:19:50,570
It's Koyabu

337
00:19:52,980 --> 00:19:56,140
Shocked me

338
00:19:56,140 --> 00:19:58,010
So sudden

339
00:19:58,010 --> 00:20:05,050
I bring you a project that corrected the definition of a fan 6 years ago, please take a look

340
00:20:05,050 --> 00:20:12,920
The 2nd Anyone Who Says "I'm Your Fan" Is Not a True Fan

341
00:20:12,920 --> 00:20:14,730
Got it

342
00:20:14,730 --> 00:20:16,990
We all encounter it often, right?

343
00:20:16,990 --> 00:20:23,900
I met someone yesterday who told me, "I love Wednesday Downtown so much"

344
00:20:23,900 --> 00:20:27,640
"I only watch Wednesday Downtown"

345
00:20:27,640 --> 00:20:29,670
Aren't you going overboard?

346
00:20:29,670 --> 00:20:33,500
Not a fan of me, but just Wednesday Downtown

347
00:20:33,500 --> 00:20:38,810
I became a representative of the program

348
00:20:51,960 --> 00:21:01,140
The 2nd Anyone Who Says "I'm Your Fan" Is Not a True Fan

349
00:21:02,030 --> 00:21:10,720
So we prepared questions about comedians that all fans should know to ask passers-by

350
00:21:03,020 --> 00:21:03,820
Shinjuku

351
00:21:10,110 --> 00:21:14,010
So bad.
-Yes, its tough

352
00:21:12,490 --> 00:21:15,710
The first participant is...

353
00:21:19,200 --> 00:21:22,460
Yasuda Dai Circus' Kuro-chan

354
00:21:20,890 --> 00:21:22,130
He has no fans

355
00:21:23,200 --> 00:21:30,100
Behind him, a moderator is waiting with surprise questions

356
00:21:28,300 --> 00:21:32,010
Working hard

357
00:21:31,360 --> 00:21:32,880
So, soon

358
00:21:33,490 --> 00:21:34,290
Here we go

359
00:21:33,970 --> 00:21:35,270
I'm sorry
-Go ahead

360
00:21:35,270 --> 00:21:36,610
Are you Kuro-chan?

361
00:21:36,610 --> 00:21:38,780
Don't say it like Agnes-chan

362
00:21:39,110 --> 00:21:41,750
Can we take a picture together?
-Yes.

363
00:21:42,190 --> 00:21:46,420
A small group of young people come to ask for a photo

364
00:21:47,000 --> 00:21:48,690
However

365
00:21:48,690 --> 00:21:50,720
Are you fans?

366
00:21:50,720 --> 00:21:53,120
Sort of... yeah

367
00:21:53,120 --> 00:21:55,730
Wait, that's not right. The tone of voice is clearly not

368
00:21:55,730 --> 00:21:57,130
It's not that we don't know you

369
00:21:57,130 --> 00:22:00,800
Know but not very well

370
00:22:00,460 --> 00:22:01,580
The truth

371
00:22:01,340 --> 00:22:07,070
They reply fairly plain so they aren't really fans of him

372
00:22:07,070 --> 00:22:09,360
It's all said and done.
-Yeah

373
00:22:07,850 --> 00:22:11,020
Totally looking down on Kuro-chan

374
00:22:11,280 --> 00:22:12,410
No fans!

375
00:22:12,960 --> 00:22:14,560
However, at this time

376
00:22:14,780 --> 00:22:17,410
Not anymore.
-Selfie again

377
00:22:17,410 --> 00:22:19,370
The photo shoot is not finished

378
00:22:18,420 --> 00:22:19,920
Are you Kuro-chan?

379
00:22:19,920 --> 00:22:21,250
Don't say it like Agnes-chan

380
00:22:21,250 --> 00:22:23,560
Save it. A frivolous sentence of nonsense

381
00:22:23,720 --> 00:22:25,360
What's so funny?

382
00:22:26,390 --> 00:22:27,660
I'm so happy to be able to meet you

383
00:22:27,660 --> 00:22:29,460
I am your fan
-Really?

384
00:22:29,460 --> 00:22:33,130
I especially like you on Wednesday Downtown

385
00:22:29,790 --> 00:22:31,160
Here we go

386
00:22:31,160 --> 00:22:33,130
Very fan-like

387
00:22:33,130 --> 00:22:34,740
Thank you

388
00:22:34,740 --> 00:22:36,170
So

389
00:22:35,570 --> 00:22:37,700
Coming
-Here we go

390
00:22:38,280 --> 00:22:43,110
As you claim to be a fan of Kuro-chan, please answer this question
-Ok

391
00:22:43,110 --> 00:22:48,650
What is the iconic word that Kuro-chan often uses at the end of sentences

392
00:22:48,810 --> 00:23:11,100
Da yo (heart)

393
00:22:54,050 --> 00:22:57,250
You said you were a fan, right?

394
00:22:57,250 --> 00:23:00,660
I am a fan of... well, how can I put it

395
00:23:00,660 --> 00:23:02,630
What is it?

396
00:23:01,840 --> 00:23:03,160
Not paying attention at all

397
00:23:02,630 --> 00:23:04,230
Does Kuro-chan use it often?

398
00:23:04,230 --> 00:23:08,670
Think back
- "desu" "Kuro-chan desu"

399
00:23:07,000 --> 00:23:08,660
"Desu" is for everyone!

400
00:23:09,470 --> 00:23:10,560
Wrong answer

401
00:23:10,530 --> 00:23:11,850
Big problem

402
00:23:11,400 --> 00:23:12,400
Are you really a fan?

403
00:23:12,400 --> 00:23:14,670
Well...

404
00:23:14,100 --> 00:23:15,920
Even if you are not a fan, you should know

405
00:23:14,710 --> 00:23:17,840
Self-proclaimed fans can leave a good impression

406
00:23:17,840 --> 00:23:20,810
You're just saying it straight out!
-Sorry, sorry, sorry

407
00:23:21,360 --> 00:23:23,890
Not even a casual fan

408
00:23:25,650 --> 00:23:27,890
No, no, cut this part out

409
00:23:27,890 --> 00:23:29,490
Don't do this

410
00:23:29,650 --> 00:23:31,920
It was just a coincidence

411
00:23:31,950 --> 00:23:33,990
But afterwards the same

412
00:23:33,990 --> 00:23:37,220
What is Kuro-chan's real name?

413
00:23:37,290 --> 00:23:50,710
Akihito Kurokawa

414
00:23:37,590 --> 00:23:40,230
Sorry, I don't know

415
00:23:40,230 --> 00:23:44,800
Absolutely no idea.
-Why? Fans should know that

416
00:23:45,040 --> 00:23:48,340
Only know his surname is Kurokawa

417
00:23:48,340 --> 00:23:50,710
Yoshihito Kurokawa

418
00:23:51,800 --> 00:23:52,830
Yoshihito Kurokawa

419
00:23:52,840 --> 00:23:53,810
What a face

420
00:23:54,610 --> 00:23:56,250
Regretfully, that's incorrect

421
00:23:56,840 --> 00:24:01,800
After that, the "I am a fan" photo scam continued

422
00:24:00,850 --> 00:24:03,250
They just want a photo

423
00:24:04,520 --> 00:24:09,030
2 hours have passed

424
00:24:07,590 --> 00:24:09,010
Tough work

425
00:24:09,730 --> 00:24:11,900
What is he pretending to do?

426
00:24:10,930 --> 00:24:11,860
I am your fan

427
00:24:11,860 --> 00:24:14,500
Really?
-Really. I like you a lot

428
00:24:15,060 --> 00:24:20,040
Finally, a determined male fan

429
00:24:22,700 --> 00:24:26,260
Kuro-chan's real name, what is his full name?

430
00:24:27,180 --> 00:24:29,650
Akihito Kurokawa

431
00:24:29,650 --> 00:24:31,380
Akihito?
-Yes

432
00:24:31,380 --> 00:24:33,250
Congratulations! The answer is correct!

433
00:24:33,250 --> 00:24:35,450
No need for the real name

434
00:24:35,450 --> 00:24:40,720
Kuro-chan is the advisor of which five-member idol group

435
00:24:40,990 --> 00:24:43,890
Mameshiba no Taigun

436
00:24:43,890 --> 00:24:45,460
Congratulations! The answer is correct!

437
00:24:45,460 --> 00:24:49,200
Finally someone that actually knows!

438
00:24:49,370 --> 00:24:52,170
Then let's go for a more difficult one

439
00:24:53,170 --> 00:24:57,270
What kind of fighting Kuro-chan is learning

440
00:24:57,270 --> 00:24:59,080
Capoeira?

441
00:24:59,080 --> 00:25:02,010
Congratulations. The answer is correct.
-There you go!

442
00:25:02,010 --> 00:25:04,750
You must be a real fan!

443
00:25:04,750 --> 00:25:10,490
Kuro-chan entered the entertainment industry originally not to be a funny artist, but what?

444
00:25:10,490 --> 00:25:11,810
Idol

445
00:25:11,810 --> 00:25:13,290
Congratulations, you answered correctly.
-Correct answer

446
00:25:13,890 --> 00:25:18,520
Girlfriend looks so bored

447
00:25:14,430 --> 00:25:16,790
My God, this is really

448
00:25:17,430 --> 00:25:19,360
I'm so happy to finally meet a real fan

449
00:25:19,360 --> 00:25:21,800
How did you get this information about me?

450
00:25:21,800 --> 00:25:24,470
Probably through Twitter

451
00:25:24,470 --> 00:25:27,570
Then you must be following me, right?
-Following?

452
00:25:27,570 --> 00:25:29,610
Eh?
-I'm not following you

453
00:25:29,610 --> 00:25:32,540
Why? Why not?

454
00:25:32,710 --> 00:25:34,380
You stopped following me?

455
00:25:34,380 --> 00:25:36,510
I used to

456
00:25:36,510 --> 00:25:39,880
Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait

457
00:25:36,660 --> 00:25:38,850
Why did you stop?

458
00:25:39,880 --> 00:25:41,390
I don't understand, I don't understand

459
00:25:41,390 --> 00:25:43,420
Why did you stop following?

460
00:25:43,720 --> 00:25:48,560
Its all pretty samey

461
00:25:46,960 --> 00:25:49,160
Twitter content?

462
00:25:48,560 --> 00:25:51,930
The things you post are all the same

463
00:25:52,580 --> 00:25:55,780
The next participant is...

464
00:25:54,460 --> 00:25:56,200
How'd he end up with this expression

465
00:25:58,130 --> 00:25:59,530
Kikuchi Ami

466
00:26:00,840 --> 00:26:02,540
Good choice

467
00:26:04,780 --> 00:26:06,680
Ami is not even hidden

468
00:26:06,540 --> 00:26:08,550
Hello
-How are you?

469
00:26:10,750 --> 00:26:13,820
Just said hello to me

470
00:26:12,270 --> 00:26:14,110
No photos?

471
00:26:13,950 --> 00:26:15,990
Stop!

472
00:26:16,560 --> 00:26:21,440
After being recognized she received a general greeting

473
00:26:20,270 --> 00:26:23,230
Afraid to disturb her

474
00:26:23,830 --> 00:26:26,730
Kikuchi Ami
-Hello

475
00:26:28,110 --> 00:26:33,570
No one wants to stop for her

476
00:26:31,370 --> 00:26:34,140
It's hard.
-Then don't talk to her!

477
00:26:33,670 --> 00:26:39,210
They all peek at me, but no one stops

478
00:26:39,950 --> 00:26:43,740
And then, an hour passed

479
00:26:42,600 --> 00:26:45,150
This expression is bad

480
00:26:45,170 --> 00:26:47,720
You're angry with Kikuchi, right?

481
00:26:48,370 --> 00:26:49,450
At this time

482
00:26:53,560 --> 00:26:56,530
What's going on?
-I'm shooting on location

483
00:26:59,430 --> 00:27:00,900
Wait, are you a fan?

484
00:27:00,900 --> 00:27:02,200
Fan?

485
00:27:02,780 --> 00:27:08,760
Finally, original IDOLING member Rika Yokoyama appears

486
00:27:10,240 --> 00:27:12,840
Are you a fan of Kikuchi?

487
00:27:12,840 --> 00:27:15,410
Not a fan

488
00:27:15,610 --> 00:27:18,780
We asked her a few questions anyway

489
00:27:18,780 --> 00:27:21,320
Please listen

490
00:27:21,320 --> 00:27:26,160
What is her nickname?
-Amimi

491
00:27:26,160 --> 00:27:29,690
Congratulations. That's the right answer.
-We were in the same group!

492
00:27:29,690 --> 00:27:31,630
Do not know is a big problem

493
00:27:32,440 --> 00:27:38,860
No one stopped for the next 30 minutes

494
00:27:45,210 --> 00:27:46,250
They're looking

495
00:27:47,710 --> 00:27:49,480
Coming over?

496
00:27:50,380 --> 00:27:57,090
May I ask if you are Kikuchi Ami? Can I take a picture with you?
-Of course

497
00:27:57,090 --> 00:27:59,020
Thank you

498
00:27:59,020 --> 00:28:00,220
You're cute

499
00:28:00,220 --> 00:28:01,220
I am a fan
-Really?

500
00:28:01,220 --> 00:28:02,260
Is it a fan?

501
00:28:02,810 --> 00:28:04,530
So

502
00:28:07,080 --> 00:28:11,440
If you call yourself a fan, please listen to the question
-Scared me a bit

503
00:28:11,440 --> 00:28:14,800
What is Kikuchi Ami's nickname?

504
00:28:14,560 --> 00:28:15,870
You should know that

505
00:28:15,760 --> 00:28:16,850
Nickname

506
00:28:18,510 --> 00:28:20,410
Amimi

507
00:28:19,140 --> 00:28:19,960
There!

508
00:28:20,410 --> 00:28:23,350
Congratulations. That's the right answer.
-Really?

509
00:28:23,350 --> 00:28:25,450
What? What is this reaction?

510
00:28:25,280 --> 00:28:28,000
Just saying?
-A guess.

511
00:28:27,350 --> 00:28:28,620
Just now is the correct answer, right?

512
00:28:29,670 --> 00:28:34,020
What is the meaning of "really?" after "correct"?

513
00:28:34,020 --> 00:28:36,230
It's intuition

514
00:28:36,390 --> 00:28:37,570
Say it like "a fan"

515
00:28:39,500 --> 00:28:44,470
Very intuitive but not a true fan

516
00:28:43,200 --> 00:28:45,700
Didn't she say she knew her?

517
00:28:44,970 --> 00:28:47,140
And after this also

518
00:28:47,140 --> 00:28:50,670
I don't know... Kikurin?

519
00:28:51,070 --> 00:28:54,280
Don't know what the nickname is

520
00:28:54,800 --> 00:29:01,150
For four hours, only 4 people claimed to be fans

521
00:29:01,150 --> 00:29:05,580
No one knows "Amimi"

522
00:29:04,960 --> 00:29:06,190
So tiring

523
00:29:06,200 --> 00:29:08,160
So, the last person was

524
00:29:11,020 --> 00:29:12,490
Diane's Tsuda

525
00:29:14,160 --> 00:29:17,170
Can we take a picture together?
-Photo?

526
00:29:17,170 --> 00:29:20,800
I'm a fan of yours.
-A fan? A fan? Really?

527
00:29:21,060 --> 00:29:22,750
Come on, stand over here

528
00:29:22,240 --> 00:29:23,470
So popular

529
00:29:26,110 --> 00:29:30,250
For those of you who claim to be Diane Tsuda-san fans, please respond

530
00:29:30,250 --> 00:29:34,790
What is Daian Tsuda's catchphrase

531
00:29:34,790 --> 00:29:48,300
Goi goi su

532
00:29:36,090 --> 00:29:39,890
That...

533
00:29:37,220 --> 00:29:38,200
No, right?

534
00:29:43,090 --> 00:29:45,260
I don't know

535
00:29:45,820 --> 00:29:47,620
Unbelievably they fail to answer correctly

536
00:29:48,770 --> 00:29:56,720
The two of them imitated Tsuda's pose and took a photo together for no apparent reason

537
00:29:56,840 --> 00:29:58,400
So rough

538
00:29:57,770 --> 00:30:01,340
Give it up

539
00:30:00,040 --> 00:30:01,340
So hurt

540
00:30:01,770 --> 00:30:04,500
At this time...

541
00:30:07,050 --> 00:30:09,450
Hello.
-Are you Tsuda from Diane?

542
00:30:09,450 --> 00:30:10,220
Yes

543
00:30:10,590 --> 00:30:13,120
I like you very much.
-A fan? So happy

544
00:30:13,120 --> 00:30:14,020
Thank you

545
00:30:14,020 --> 00:30:15,230
Ready to go

546
00:30:14,770 --> 00:30:19,290
This man has the most basic Tsuda knowledge base

547
00:30:20,760 --> 00:30:22,190
So

548
00:30:22,180 --> 00:30:23,180
Let's go

549
00:30:25,520 --> 00:30:29,210
For those of you who claim to be fans of Diane's Tsuda, please listen to the question

550
00:30:30,910 --> 00:30:34,240
What is Tsuda's real name?

551
00:30:34,240 --> 00:30:46,990
Atsuhiro

552
00:30:37,910 --> 00:30:39,550
Tsuda's... name

553
00:30:40,250 --> 00:30:42,850
Takafumi Tsuda

554
00:30:44,600 --> 00:30:45,950
Incorrect

555
00:30:46,990 --> 00:30:48,290
Atsuhiro

556
00:30:49,360 --> 00:30:52,030
Sorry, I'm a fan but I didn't know

557
00:30:53,100 --> 00:30:57,100
What is the name of Tsuda's partner?

558
00:30:56,630 --> 00:31:04,470
Yusuke

559
00:30:57,100 --> 00:31:00,540
I know the face.
-Really?

560
00:30:57,760 --> 00:30:58,580
No, right?

561
00:31:00,700 --> 00:31:03,670
Suchi?

562
00:31:03,680 --> 00:31:04,470
Incorrect

563
00:31:05,340 --> 00:31:08,650
What is Tsuda's name?

564
00:31:08,650 --> 00:31:12,320
Yasahiro
-Atsuhiro!

565
00:31:12,480 --> 00:31:14,800
Not interested in remembering it at all
-Doesn't want to remember

566
00:31:14,800 --> 00:31:16,650
Just wants to go home

567
00:31:19,890 --> 00:31:21,860
Tsuda
-How are you?

568
00:31:21,860 --> 00:31:23,690
I'm a fan

569
00:31:23,690 --> 00:31:27,630
I've liked Shibuya for a long time

570
00:31:27,630 --> 00:31:28,430
Ah, not my fan

571
00:31:28,430 --> 00:31:31,900
Goi goi su

572
00:31:30,570 --> 00:31:31,920
She's a fan of Shibuya

573
00:31:36,470 --> 00:31:38,440
That's not it

574
00:31:40,180 --> 00:31:41,140
Here we go

575
00:31:41,140 --> 00:31:43,050
Are you working? I've been watching you on TV

576
00:31:43,060 --> 00:31:44,950
Really? Thank you.
I'm a die-hard fan

577
00:31:44,950 --> 00:31:46,490
A die-hard fan?

578
00:31:45,500 --> 00:31:46,480
Here we go

579
00:31:46,980 --> 00:31:48,290
Die-hard fan

580
00:31:48,280 --> 00:31:49,710
So

581
00:31:50,670 --> 00:31:53,970
What is Tsuda's name?

582
00:31:55,290 --> 00:31:59,330
Masa Tsuda... Masamori

583
00:31:59,340 --> 00:32:00,030
Masamori

584
00:32:00,360 --> 00:32:02,300
Masa...mori

585
00:32:03,700 --> 00:32:06,670
Aren't you die-hard fans?

586
00:32:06,670 --> 00:32:11,780
As expected, there is not a single real fan

587
00:32:12,500 --> 00:32:13,810
At this time

588
00:32:16,180 --> 00:32:17,210
Another acquaintance?

589
00:32:17,840 --> 00:32:23,850
Some juniors, who happened to be passing by after a theater performance, were asked to answer the questions as well

590
00:32:23,240 --> 00:32:24,320
Small umbrella

591
00:32:23,860 --> 00:32:24,550
Please listen

592
00:32:26,590 --> 00:32:31,630
Naoki Tsuda

593
00:32:31,730 --> 00:32:33,630
I know it

594
00:32:33,630 --> 00:32:35,970
Atsuhi Tsuda

595
00:32:36,730 --> 00:32:38,230
Not right at all

596
00:32:38,230 --> 00:32:44,070
In summary
No one knows Tsuda's name

597
00:32:44,070 --> 00:32:47,440
The end is not right, what is this conclusion

598
00:32:47,440 --> 00:32:49,210
Such a sad conclusion

599
00:32:49,210 --> 00:32:55,550
So sad, when they said his name wrong Tsuda tutted

600
00:32:58,290 --> 00:33:00,130
What's his name?

601
00:33:01,090 --> 00:33:02,660
Tsk

602
00:33:02,660 --> 00:33:05,500
The worst is Amimi, right?

603
00:33:05,500 --> 00:33:08,460
Not even a chance to play

604
00:33:08,460 --> 00:33:11,970
Sugiyama looked like Stallone

605
00:33:12,530 --> 00:33:15,030
Let's welcome the next presenter

606
00:33:20,410 --> 00:33:23,060
It's ZAZY
-He's dressed up

607
00:33:23,060 --> 00:33:25,680
Hello, I am ZAZY
-Nice legs

608
00:33:25,680 --> 00:33:28,640
ZAZY be careful
-It's okay

609
00:33:28,640 --> 00:33:30,920
So

610
00:33:31,360 --> 00:33:35,050
Do you remember who the R-1 champion was this year?

611
00:33:35,050 --> 00:33:37,760
Of course I remember.
-How can I put it? It's hard not to remember

612
00:33:37,760 --> 00:33:39,530
It does ring a bell

613
00:33:39,530 --> 00:33:41,870
It was Shinichi

614
00:33:41,870 --> 00:33:44,450
We usually perform together

615
00:33:44,450 --> 00:33:47,590
That's okay, right?
-I'm grateful for that

616
00:33:47,590 --> 00:33:50,560
Every time Shinichi and I perform together

617
00:33:50,560 --> 00:33:55,750
He will always carry the R-1 trophy

618
00:33:55,750 --> 00:33:57,790
What does everyone think about this?

619
00:33:57,790 --> 00:33:59,660
Don't think much of it

620
00:33:59,660 --> 00:34:01,380
He likes to have his photo taken with it

621
00:34:01,380 --> 00:34:03,120
Photo?

622
00:34:03,120 --> 00:34:05,550
Says "hold the trophy like this"

623
00:34:06,720 --> 00:34:07,860
Its a bit annoying

624
00:34:07,860 --> 00:34:09,560
Tells you to hold trophy and asks "can we take a picture"

625
00:34:09,560 --> 00:34:12,460
Please give it a hug" like your own child"
-Indeed

626
00:34:13,110 --> 00:34:15,200
"Please see it one last time" like this

627
00:34:16,410 --> 00:34:20,680
So, i've brought a theory about the trophy

628
00:34:21,450 --> 00:34:26,350
Shinichi's R-1 trophy shtick doesn't amuse anyone

629
00:34:26,350 --> 00:34:29,510
The trophy

630
00:34:29,510 --> 00:34:31,890
He brings it every time

631
00:34:31,890 --> 00:34:34,430
With it, the host will also mention the trophy, right?

632
00:34:34,430 --> 00:34:35,540
The process is like this

633
00:34:35,540 --> 00:34:38,870
But he's never ready to respond at all.
-Indeed

634
00:34:40,060 --> 00:34:41,900
That's true

635
00:34:41,900 --> 00:34:46,030
There's only ever this kind of dialogue: "why did you bring the trophy here" "why can't I?"

636
00:34:46,030 --> 00:34:48,460
Instead, he's angry.
-It only makes people think what's going on?

637
00:34:50,170 --> 00:34:55,410
So this time we have done a prank to destroy his trophy

638
00:34:56,400 --> 00:34:58,360
Destroy it?

639
00:34:58,350 --> 00:35:00,360
Does this qualify as a prank?

640
00:35:00,360 --> 00:35:06,780
But it's not good to damage his real trophy anyway.
-It's not the real one

641
00:35:06,780 --> 00:35:08,330
The one used is very similar to the real trophy

642
00:35:08,330 --> 00:35:10,260
The real one still exists

643
00:35:10,260 --> 00:35:12,370
Replica?
-It's a replica

644
00:35:12,370 --> 00:35:17,060
We'll break the replica in front of him to see his reaction

645
00:35:17,910 --> 00:35:25,310
Shinichi's R-1 trophy shtick doesn't amuse anyone

646
00:35:27,110 --> 00:35:29,960
First, the replica is made

647
00:35:29,960 --> 00:35:35,850
We received help from the Osaka art professionals in charge of making the real trophy

648
00:35:36,620 --> 00:35:41,210
Rather than a replica, they just make another one

649
00:35:40,520 --> 00:35:41,980
So it is
-Another real one

650
00:35:45,310 --> 00:35:49,370
He was also in a scene where he cooked with the names of people he found on the street, which aired a few days ago

651
00:35:50,420 --> 00:35:53,670
In between placing the trophy in the outside bus during his break

652
00:35:54,400 --> 00:35:56,370
We took photos

653
00:35:56,370 --> 00:35:58,520
On the basis of this photo

654
00:35:59,690 --> 00:36:05,560
The old trophy scratches and dirt also were added to the new trophy

655
00:36:06,290 --> 00:36:07,710
Later

656
00:36:07,710 --> 00:36:09,260
Good morning

657
00:36:09,080 --> 00:36:10,780
Bringing it with him

658
00:36:11,930 --> 00:36:19,120
For this prank, we invited Shinichi to a fake interview

659
00:36:19,120 --> 00:36:20,590
Doesn't even put it in a bag

660
00:36:20,590 --> 00:36:22,490
Carries it every time

661
00:36:22,560 --> 00:36:25,680
Let's move to another room first

662
00:36:26,380 --> 00:36:30,070
We create a moment in which he is forced to leave the room

663
00:36:35,680 --> 00:36:38,060
Hard to tell which one is which

664
00:36:37,280 --> 00:36:40,480
The real thing is replaced

665
00:36:43,080 --> 00:36:44,990
Shinichi is completely unaware

666
00:36:44,990 --> 00:36:48,300
And takes the replica

667
00:36:48,300 --> 00:36:50,810
The preparation work is done

668
00:36:51,490 --> 00:36:54,660
The day before the trophy's destruction

669
00:36:54,220 --> 00:36:55,980
What kind of caption is this?

670
00:36:56,930 --> 00:36:58,760
Here is the prank

671
00:36:58,930 --> 00:37:01,900
Understood, I'm really looking forward to it

672
00:37:02,400 --> 00:37:04,530
About this operation

673
00:37:04,530 --> 00:37:09,740
There's a bug in the trophy

674
00:37:09,740 --> 00:37:13,600
That's right. In fact, when we made the replica

675
00:37:14,310 --> 00:37:18,060
A bug was placed at the base of the replica

676
00:37:19,310 --> 00:37:25,450
We have a fake program to verify whether "celebrities' homes are bugged"

677
00:37:25,450 --> 00:37:27,450
For this, we visit Shinichi's home

678
00:37:28,400 --> 00:37:31,590
Experts will find the wiretap

679
00:37:28,660 --> 00:37:31,430
Bug Hunter

680
00:37:31,590 --> 00:37:36,800
In order to take out the bug, the trophy must be destroyed

681
00:37:37,600 --> 00:37:39,200
I'm so excited

682
00:37:39,400 --> 00:37:43,210
I actually want to break it myself

683
00:37:42,930 --> 00:37:44,020
Such an evil expression

684
00:37:43,810 --> 00:37:47,210
So, the prank begins

685
00:37:47,210 --> 00:37:50,180
Hello
-Nice to meet you

686
00:37:50,350 --> 00:37:54,680
This is a special program to thoroughly investigate the homes of celebrities

687
00:37:54,680 --> 00:37:58,620
We visited the homes of 50 celebrities

688
00:37:58,690 --> 00:38:00,440
What lies are you telling?

689
00:37:58,910 --> 00:38:02,690
Shinichi is the 16th.
-16th!?

690
00:38:02,690 --> 00:38:06,730
Does Shinichi have any memories of being spyed on?

691
00:38:06,930 --> 00:38:09,500
In front of the house

692
00:38:09,500 --> 00:38:13,500
There was a person standing there, I wasn't sure if they were a fan or what

693
00:38:14,300 --> 00:38:16,470
Feels like a stalker

694
00:38:16,570 --> 00:38:17,920
Eh?

695
00:38:17,920 --> 00:38:25,280
Thankfully, Shinichi is already weary of stalker-like fans

696
00:38:25,280 --> 00:38:28,150
The closer the instrument is to the bug, the louder the sound

697
00:38:28,400 --> 00:38:33,650
A check takes place for potential detection devices placed by fans

698
00:38:33,990 --> 00:38:35,390
Thankfully there isn't one

699
00:38:35,980 --> 00:38:38,050
Finally, the time arrives

700
00:38:39,430 --> 00:38:42,500
I'm really looking forward to how he will react

701
00:38:44,370 --> 00:38:46,800
Eh... scary!
-Wait

702
00:38:46,800 --> 00:38:49,270
It's responding.
-What's the situation?

703
00:38:49,270 --> 00:38:51,410
This TV is a bit suspicious

704
00:38:54,240 --> 00:38:56,410
This expression is really quite worried

705
00:38:58,250 --> 00:39:01,280
Nothing on this side

706
00:39:03,520 --> 00:39:05,190
Eh? Scary

707
00:39:06,190 --> 00:39:09,670
The instrument obviously reacts to the trophy

708
00:39:10,760 --> 00:39:11,960
There is a response

709
00:39:12,100 --> 00:39:14,960
Eh? Scary!

710
00:39:14,960 --> 00:39:17,760
Is it really true?

711
00:39:16,450 --> 00:39:17,760
After all, he's always with the trophy

712
00:39:17,760 --> 00:39:19,420
Then

713
00:39:20,070 --> 00:39:21,900
It's in the base

714
00:39:22,240 --> 00:39:24,510
Do you want to try it?
-Wait a minute

715
00:39:24,770 --> 00:39:26,880
It can't be
-Just now it made a sound

716
00:39:28,080 --> 00:39:31,280
Ah this is so scary and disgusting

717
00:39:31,910 --> 00:39:39,680
The sound coming from the headphones confirmed that there was indeed a bug in the trophy

718
00:39:40,860 --> 00:39:43,390
Break it!

719
00:39:43,730 --> 00:39:46,400
Finally it's time to break the trophy

720
00:39:43,990 --> 00:39:45,450
What a badass

721
00:39:46,400 --> 00:39:47,970
Take it out

722
00:39:48,480 --> 00:39:51,770
A few weeks ago he was tricked into talking bad about Nagano

723
00:39:51,770 --> 00:39:53,950
He said, "how long are you going to carry the trophy?"

724
00:39:53,950 --> 00:39:55,540
It's so true

725
00:39:56,630 --> 00:40:00,750
That part was genuine.
-Shinichi got super angry hearing that

726
00:40:01,820 --> 00:40:06,550
Finally it's time to break the trophy

727
00:40:06,550 --> 00:40:08,720
Take it out

728
00:40:08,720 --> 00:40:11,120
Excuse me.
-What? What do you mean?

729
00:40:11,960 --> 00:40:14,150
How do I get it out?
-Really messing with people

730
00:40:14,150 --> 00:40:15,890
Can you disassemble it?
-Excuse me

731
00:40:15,890 --> 00:40:17,890
No, wait, why?

732
00:40:20,300 --> 00:40:21,360
So sudden?

733
00:40:21,530 --> 00:40:22,660
Which line of business is this practitioner in?

734
00:40:24,230 --> 00:40:25,810
Can you disassemble it?
-Excuse me

735
00:40:25,810 --> 00:40:28,480
No, wait, why?

736
00:40:28,480 --> 00:40:29,910
This will never work, right?

737
00:40:34,840 --> 00:40:37,020
Looks like he's seen his son get beaten up

738
00:40:38,060 --> 00:40:40,320
How can you demolish it like this?

739
00:40:39,350 --> 00:40:41,250
This is it

740
00:40:41,250 --> 00:40:44,720
There it is, the bug

741
00:40:45,420 --> 00:40:48,160
What the hell is this? Was it spying on me for four months?

742
00:40:48,160 --> 00:40:50,730
Indeed, this is a wiretap

743
00:40:51,300 --> 00:40:53,930
More than the trophy being broken

744
00:40:53,930 --> 00:40:58,510
His first thought is that he's been bugged for four months

745
00:40:59,820 --> 00:41:01,300
Then

746
00:41:01,300 --> 00:41:03,340
Ah, my trophy!

747
00:41:03,340 --> 00:41:08,820
Despite the slow reaction, he's now angry at the trophy's destruction

748
00:41:09,010 --> 00:41:12,350
Wait a minute, my trophy. What do I do now?

749
00:41:12,420 --> 00:41:15,120
It's not okay to break the trophy, right?

750
00:41:15,120 --> 00:41:19,300
I don't understand this dismantling method

751
00:41:19,300 --> 00:41:21,440
Ah...

752
00:41:21,440 --> 00:41:23,530
What do I do now?

753
00:41:23,530 --> 00:41:26,560
This won't work!

754
00:41:26,560 --> 00:41:28,660
It's a big fuss

755
00:41:30,930 --> 00:41:32,640
This is something that changed my life

756
00:41:34,300 --> 00:41:37,070
Seeing it at the point of no return is just too much

757
00:41:38,170 --> 00:41:39,590
Shinichi, this can't be repaired

758
00:41:39,590 --> 00:41:40,680
It's not possible

759
00:41:40,680 --> 00:41:42,350
Already shattered

760
00:41:42,350 --> 00:41:43,860
After all, it was smashed with a hammer

761
00:41:43,860 --> 00:41:45,540
It's true.
-It's a hammer

762
00:41:45,540 --> 00:41:49,420
No, no, this is messed up

763
00:41:49,420 --> 00:41:51,590
This is a bit...

764
00:41:52,930 --> 00:41:54,890
What do I do now?

765
00:41:57,580 --> 00:42:02,040
Just as Zazy had hoped, Shinichi is in a very depressed mood

766
00:42:02,570 --> 00:42:05,370
Go for it

767
00:42:06,030 --> 00:42:11,700
The truth is revealed

768
00:42:12,240 --> 00:42:14,910
Aren't you super angry?

769
00:42:15,140 --> 00:42:17,480
What is it? What the hell is going on here?

770
00:42:19,420 --> 00:42:20,580
This is a trophy-breaking prank

771
00:42:22,640 --> 00:42:25,390
Eh? You guys have gone too far

772
00:42:26,160 --> 00:42:27,900
This time, it went too far

773
00:42:27,900 --> 00:42:32,130
It's really not good, seriously!

774
00:42:32,130 --> 00:42:34,000
What's wrong with you?

775
00:42:32,520 --> 00:42:34,310
Still thinks its the real thing

776
00:42:34,000 --> 00:42:36,470
Do you know what this program is?

777
00:42:36,600 --> 00:42:39,470
Wednesday Downtownï¼Ÿ

778
00:42:39,970 --> 00:42:41,400
You broke the trophy?

779
00:42:41,400 --> 00:42:44,470
No, no, no, even a program shouldn't be able to break my trophy, right?

780
00:42:44,470 --> 00:42:46,280
This is really not possible, right?

781
00:42:46,280 --> 00:42:48,180
It has nothing to do with whether it's Downtown's program or not

782
00:42:48,180 --> 00:42:50,380
This shouldn't be done, right?

783
00:42:50,380 --> 00:42:54,320
If this was your idea then you should be the one to fix it for me

784
00:42:54,320 --> 00:42:55,790
Go to the makers

785
00:42:55,790 --> 00:42:59,520
Go to Kansai TV and beg them to make another one

786
00:42:59,520 --> 00:43:00,390
Make the same one

787
00:43:00,390 --> 00:43:03,200
Why would I do such a thing?
-You have to, this was all you!

788
00:43:03,890 --> 00:43:07,890
Not surprisingly, there's a terrible atmosphere

789
00:43:12,470 --> 00:43:15,040
Hey, #2? Newly made?

790
00:43:16,610 --> 00:43:18,510
This is the real thing

791
00:43:20,180 --> 00:43:23,550
Give it to me, wait, don't do this kind of thing!

792
00:43:24,910 --> 00:43:27,030
Holding onto it

793
00:43:27,080 --> 00:43:28,450
The child has returned home

794
00:43:31,350 --> 00:43:33,820
The other one was just a replica

795
00:43:35,390 --> 00:43:36,480
Even the marks?

796
00:43:38,140 --> 00:43:39,880
Whoa

797
00:43:40,030 --> 00:43:42,500
I panicked!

798
00:43:42,500 --> 00:43:44,830
Ah, my brain is shutting down

799
00:43:45,840 --> 00:43:47,940
I'm always holding it, when was it swapped?

800
00:43:47,940 --> 00:43:51,470
Wait, is the wiretap real?

801
00:43:51,470 --> 00:43:55,950
The wiretaps aren't real.
-Wait a minute

802
00:43:55,950 --> 00:43:59,080
Wait a minute, wait a minute, i'm numb

803
00:43:59,080 --> 00:44:00,440
You waited until now to destroy it?

804
00:44:00,440 --> 00:44:07,430
The switch was made three days prior

805
00:44:07,430 --> 00:44:13,370
But he misunderstood and thought he had been bugged the whole time and begins to panic

806
00:44:13,730 --> 00:44:16,070
No, really, don't!

807
00:44:19,500 --> 00:44:22,100
It won't go on air.
-What do you mean?

808
00:44:22,100 --> 00:44:25,070
I don't think it's going to make it to air.
-What are you saying?

809
00:44:25,070 --> 00:44:29,910
I can't do this!

810
00:44:29,910 --> 00:44:36,450
Due to the interesting turn of events, we let him believe his misunderstanding a bit longer

811
00:44:36,620 --> 00:44:38,650
Since a few days ago?

812
00:44:38,650 --> 00:44:43,150
It's been a week or so.
-It can't be broadcast. It can't be broadcast

813
00:44:43,150 --> 00:44:46,760
Why don't you explain what has been going on

814
00:44:46,760 --> 00:44:48,100
For your own good, come clean

815
00:44:50,300 --> 00:44:53,940
I XX'd

816
00:44:54,300 --> 00:44:56,640
With a fan?

817
00:44:57,280 --> 00:44:59,250
Wait a second, it's over

818
00:44:59,250 --> 00:45:00,810
So was there anything that couldn't be broadcast yesterday?

819
00:45:02,250 --> 00:45:03,950
Why do it in front of the trophy

820
00:45:04,050 --> 00:45:05,920
NO

821
00:45:08,420 --> 00:45:15,720
In summary
Shinichi's DM's are always open

822
00:45:17,690 --> 00:45:19,440
What the hell?

823
00:45:19,440 --> 00:45:21,050
Even brought out some other stuff

824
00:45:21,820 --> 00:45:23,400
An unexpected twist

825
00:45:23,400 --> 00:45:24,470
What is this?
-The last part is just too much

826
00:45:24,470 --> 00:45:27,690
There was no wiretapping, was there?
-No wiretapping at all

827
00:45:28,970 --> 00:45:32,270
He embraces his trophy and his fans

828
00:45:32,270 --> 00:45:33,320
What happened in the end?

829
00:45:33,320 --> 00:45:36,980
Hopefully he won't carry it around anymore

830
00:45:36,980 --> 00:45:39,750
I worked with him yesterday too

831
00:45:39,750 --> 00:45:42,640
He took the trophy to Hokkaido
