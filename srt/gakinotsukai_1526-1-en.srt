The dirty joke there is a bit inappropriate

182
00:08:32,850 --> 00:08:35,190
Yeah you're right, it does feel inappropriate

183
00:08:36,030 --> 00:08:36,270
Yes!

184
00:08:38,260 --> 00:08:39,190
What's going on?

185
00:08:43,030 --> 00:08:45,460
This is the Goodnight time

186
00:08:45,460 --> 00:08:48,580
They're probably feeling tired

187
00:08:48,760 --> 00:08:51,640
So you can take a nap if you want to

188
00:08:54,300 --> 00:08:55,850
Well, yeah they're 8 years old

189
00:08:55,850 --> 00:08:56,450
Yep

190
00:08:56,450 --> 00:08:59,640
So here comes the Goodnigh time

191
00:09:00,460 --> 00:09:02,330
Please take your time to rest

192
00:09:23,000 --> 00:09:25,520
Naoki-kun... Naoki-kun fell asleep right

193
00:09:25,790 --> 00:09:28,690
Naoki-kun feels more like a salary man

194
00:09:30,560 --> 00:09:32,280
instead of 8 years old

195
00:09:38,840 --> 00:09:41,730
Housei-chan dreamed about something just now right?

196
00:09:41,730 --> 00:09:44,120

Yes, I saw a dream

198
00:09:46,430 --> 00:09:48,410

199
00:09:48,410 --> 00:09:50,270

While they've been 8 years old for now

257
00:11:53,850 --> 00:11:56,810

00:12:14,130 --> 00:12:14,970
Really?!

263
00:12:21,070 --> 00:12:21,760

Well, well

266
00:12:27,870 --> 00:12:29,710
Hosei-kun, what's going on with you?

267
00:12:31,630 --> 00:12:34,860
I found this thing... It's shining...

-That was too awful     -Please return to your seats

275
00:12:57,240 --> 00:12:59,290

276
00:12:59,290 --> 00:13:03,160
Oh I see, then let's have a break now

277
00:13:04,080 --> 00:13:05,480
Please take your time to rest

278
00:13:05,480 --> 00:13:07,320
Can I pee? Can I pee too?

296
00:14:08,700 --> 00:14:10,640
Matsumoto-san, what is this about?

297
00:14:10,700 --> 00:14:13,180
So now, there's a box in front of everyone right?

298
00:14:13,240 --> 00:14:14,080
-Yes!     -Yes!

299
00:14:14,080 --> 00:14:18,940
The box is filled with all kinds of different items

300
00:14:18,940 --> 00:14:25,040
Please react as a 8 years old after seeing the thing inside

301
00:14:25,040 --> 00:14:26,770
Each box is filled with different things

302
00:14:26,770 --> 00:14:28,320
Oh, I see I see

303
00:14:28,640 --> 00:14:30,650
But before that...

304
00:14:32,180 --> 00:14:34,770
3 years old time!

305
00:15:09,730 --> 00:15:11,120

00:15:23,440 --> 00:15:25,230
Please drink some water

310
00:15:26,880 --> 00:15:30,220
Because they're at this age, their body needs water

311
00:15:30,220 --> 00:15:32,730
And they still need to show their reactions next

312
00:15:34,230 --> 00:15:35,230
There's no water?

313
00:15:35,330 --> 00:15:36,060
Are you okay?

314
00:15:36,900 --> 00:15:38,330
Yeah there's no water for me...

315
00:15:38,330 --> 00:15:41,000
Oh there's no water for you? Then never mind

316
00:15:41,000 --> 00:15:41,920
Pocari...

317
00:15:42,120 --> 00:15:44,730
Yes? There's obviously no Pocari...

318
00:15:46,410 --> 00:15:49,340
Matsumoto-san, who's having which box is not decided yet right?

319
00:15:49,340 --> 00:15:50,570
Yes of course

320
00:15:50,570 --> 00:15:52,160
You can choose whichever box you like

321
00:15:52,160 --> 00:15:54,400
Oh yes! So I can choose any box?

322
00:15:54,400 --> 00:15:56,710
Yes, but there's different drawings in front

323
00:15:56,710 --> 00:15:57,570
Which one will you choose?

324
00:15:57,570 --> 00:15:58,320
How is it?

325
00:15:58,800 --> 00:16:00,960
-Oh a car!     -Car!     -Car!

326
00:16:00,980 --> 00:16:03,540
My dad has a car so it's gonna be mine

327
00:16:04,150 --> 00:16:05,100
My dad has a car too!

328
00:16:05,590 --> 00:16:07,000
Everyone's dad has a car

329
00:16:07,000 --> 00:16:08,050
My dad has 100 cars though

330
00:16:08,050 --> 00:16:09,700
Which one is the 3 years old time button?

331
00:16:09,700 --> 00:16:10,600
This one

332
00:16:10,600 --> 00:16:11,690
I like animals instead

333
00:16:11,930 --> 00:16:14,430
3 years old time

334
00:16:36,540 --> 00:16:38,240
Finish

335
00:16:39,750 --> 00:16:40,710
It's finished

336
00:16:41,000 --> 00:16:47,330
5 years old time

337
00:16:47,330 --> 00:16:49,500

3 years old time

339
00:17:06,700 --> 00:17:09,120
Hold on to 3 years old time for a while!

340
00:17:09,120 --> 00:17:10,970
Hold on to 3 years old time for a while!

341
00:17:16,420 --> 00:17:17,510
Okay 10 more minutes

342
00:17:33,530 --> 00:17:37,010
Goodnight time!

343
00:17:39,400 --> 00:17:41,290
Good for you all

344
00:17:41,290 --> 00:17:42,930
So tired, so tired

345
00:17:42,930 --> 00:17:44,450
What a lovely Goodnight time

346
00:17:48,970 --> 00:17:50,990
Naoki-kun fell asleep while standing

347
00:17:50,990 --> 00:17:53,780
He must be very tired

348
00:17:55,130 --> 00:17:56,950
Naoki-kun don't even need to lie down

349
00:17:56,950 --> 00:17:58,950
He still looks like a salary man though

350
00:17:58,950 --> 00:18:00,190
Is it?

351
00:18:01,500 --> 00:18:04,090
Okay, finished!

352
00:18:04,090 --> 00:18:05,940
Well, well

353
00:18:06,410 --> 00:18:08,150
Choose the box that you like

354
00:18:08,150 --> 00:18:09,150
Please hurry up though

355
00:18:10,230 --> 00:18:11,960
Don't let me ask you too many times

356
00:18:12,920 --> 00:18:15,680
Komoto-kun are you having a heartache?

357
00:18:16,300 --> 00:18:18,070
Yes, yes, it hurts

358
00:18:18,070 --> 00:18:19,210
So you hurt your heart?

359
00:18:19,320 --> 00:18:20,380
Not that I hurt my heart

360
00:18:20,710 --> 00:18:21,820
But my heart is just not feeling well

361
00:18:21,820 --> 00:18:23,150
Okay I see

362
00:18:25,230 --> 00:18:26,290
Just a bit tired right

363
00:18:26,690 --> 00:18:28,030
So can you continue?

364
00:18:28,650 --> 00:18:30,580
No, I can't do it anymore

365
00:18:32,440 --> 00:18:34,290
What? What did you just say?

366
00:18:36,060 --> 00:18:37,400
Uncle Hamada just now

367
00:18:37,840 --> 00:18:39,740
asked can you continue and you said?

368
00:18:39,740 --> 00:18:42,510
No, no more

369
00:18:43,390 --> 00:18:46,540
While being stressed by Hamada's traumatic requests,

370
00:18:46,540 --> 00:18:50,130
the members still try hard to react as a 8 years old

371
00:18:50,130 --> 00:18:51,240
Wow, what's this?

372
00:18:51,240 --> 00:18:53,240

375
00:18:57,870 --> 00:18:58,800
Ah, yeah it is

376
00:18:58,800 --> 00:19:00,800
Judgement: Yamamoto 8 years old!!

377
00:19:00,650 --> 00:19:01,840
You thought it was a car didn't you?

378
00:19:01,840 --> 00:19:03,840
I thought it was going to be a car

379
00:19:04,780 --> 00:19:08,050
You should behave as a role model for being the first one to present

380
00:19:08,560 --> 00:19:10,820

Awesome! So lucky!

384
00:19:19,190 --> 00:19:21,190
Are you even able to catch it?

385
00:19:21,190 --> 00:19:23,280
Aren't you actually scared of it?

386
00:19:23,860 --> 00:19:27,100

Judgement: Komoto 8 years old

388
00:19:32,320 --> 00:19:34,170
No way, he asked me to open my mouth

389
00:19:34,170 --> 00:19:36,170
-8 years old!     -Ouch, ouch, it hurts

390
00:19:36,110 --> 00:19:38,170
