1
00:00:00,850 --> 00:00:03,520
Uncle Lizard

2
00:00:06,420 --> 00:00:08,930
Where is he gone...?

3
00:00:08,930 --> 00:00:11,970
Uncle!

4
00:00:12,580 --> 00:00:13,970
Uncle!

5
00:00:15,890 --> 00:00:17,120
Uncle!

6
00:00:18,000 --> 00:00:18,800
Hey!

7
00:00:19,410 --> 00:00:20,490
Uncle!

8
00:00:20,490 --> 00:00:22,490
Sorry about being late

9
00:00:22,490 --> 00:00:24,370
This! Eat!

10
00:00:24,370 --> 00:00:26,130
What's this?

11
00:00:26,130 --> 00:00:28,590
A croquette

12
00:00:28,590 --> 00:00:29,730
Eat!

13
00:00:29,730 --> 00:00:31,320
Are you hungry?

14
00:00:31,320 --> 00:00:34,560
...not so much

15
00:00:34,560 --> 00:00:36,100
Here

16
00:00:36,100 --> 00:00:37,330
Thanks

17
00:00:39,770 --> 00:00:42,310
Don't you have a sauce?

18
00:00:43,770 --> 00:00:45,750
I forgot it

19
00:00:45,750 --> 00:00:47,160
Never mind

20
00:00:47,160 --> 00:00:49,300
All right?

21
00:00:49,490 --> 00:00:50,590
Sorry

22
00:00:51,000 --> 00:00:53,780
Some pour a worcester sauce

23
00:00:53,780 --> 00:00:56,470
Others pour a soy sauce

24
00:00:56,950 --> 00:00:59,550
I like both

25
00:00:59,550 --> 00:01:01,020
I see

26
00:01:12,380 --> 00:01:13,620
You said?

27
00:01:15,560 --> 00:01:17,080
In fact

28
00:01:18,090 --> 00:01:20,190
I didn't say yet

29
00:01:21,920 --> 00:01:25,910
The other day, I got mammy to buy a dog

30
00:01:26,540 --> 00:01:27,910
So

31
00:01:30,920 --> 00:01:36,850
I thought about it later

32
00:01:37,310 --> 00:01:41,200
If I had not told, it's rather good

33
00:01:41,200 --> 00:01:42,740
What does it mean?

34
00:01:43,200 --> 00:01:52,530
Your mother...she won't understand

35
00:01:53,290 --> 00:01:54,380
About what?

36
00:01:54,380 --> 00:01:58,150
If you ask her to have this kind of guy

37
00:01:58,470 --> 00:01:59,800
You?

38
00:02:00,360 --> 00:02:01,990
It's not a problem

39
00:02:01,990 --> 00:02:03,700
It's me who want to have

40
00:02:04,580 --> 00:02:07,080
My child

41
00:02:07,080 --> 00:02:08,440
Sorry, I called you my child

42
00:02:08,440 --> 00:02:09,500
Never mind

43
00:02:11,060 --> 00:02:11,920
After all

44
00:02:11,920 --> 00:02:17,040
When you said that you bought a dog etc.

45
00:02:17,040 --> 00:02:19,220
"It's like as I expected"

46
00:02:19,220 --> 00:02:22,400
You mean, what?

47
00:02:22,720 --> 00:02:26,200
It was disappointing or rather

48
00:02:27,200 --> 00:02:29,780
"This child..."

49
00:02:29,780 --> 00:02:30,800
"too"

50
00:02:32,050 --> 00:02:33,560
Because it's

51
00:02:33,560 --> 00:02:35,800
Well, well

52
00:02:35,800 --> 00:02:36,850
It's mummy

53
00:02:36,850 --> 00:02:37,900
Listen

54
00:02:38,100 --> 00:02:41,040
Since you told that you had a dog

55
00:02:41,040 --> 00:02:44,700
so couldn't have me

56
00:02:44,700 --> 00:02:49,320
"So it's like that for you"

57
00:02:49,320 --> 00:02:52,200
I don't understand

58
00:02:53,300 --> 00:02:56,520
"If you see me as a uncle of a lizard?"

59
00:02:56,700 --> 00:03:01,540
You see me as a lizard

60
00:03:01,540 --> 00:03:02,580
So you have such a idea

61
00:03:02,580 --> 00:03:04,100
That's not!

62
00:03:08,850 --> 00:03:10,870
Probably, you're right

63
00:03:10,870 --> 00:03:13,600
What I want to say,

64
00:03:13,600 --> 00:03:15,600
How can I tell you...

65
00:03:15,600 --> 00:03:17,800
If you think like that,

66
00:03:17,810 --> 00:03:19,800
it'll be impossible

67
00:03:20,240 --> 00:03:21,900
We can't be together

68
00:03:23,900 --> 00:03:25,300
I don't think so

69
00:03:25,700 --> 00:03:31,000
But, you know

70
00:03:31,550 --> 00:03:33,200
You will lose interest

71
00:03:34,400 --> 00:03:36,900
In what? Uncle?

72
00:03:37,300 --> 00:03:38,260
Why!?

73
00:03:38,260 --> 00:03:40,080
At first, you're curious

74
00:03:40,080 --> 00:03:42,300
"Uncle Lizard"

75
00:03:42,300 --> 00:03:44,960
After the summer vacation, you go to school

76
00:03:44,960 --> 00:03:47,050
"There is a uncle lizard at my house!"

77
00:03:47,400 --> 00:03:49,100
Up until now, no problem!

78
00:03:50,600 --> 00:03:52,160
I can picture it

79
00:03:52,160 --> 00:03:53,800
An ant...

80
00:03:54,550 --> 00:03:55,890
I can picture

81
00:03:56,550 --> 00:03:58,560
I'll be pleased

82
00:03:58,560 --> 00:04:00,560
If I find an uncle lizard at my house

83
00:04:01,540 --> 00:04:02,700
Isn't it?

84
00:04:02,700 --> 00:04:03,780
I understand you!

85
00:04:03,780 --> 00:04:06,400
Even uncle understand it

86
00:04:06,950 --> 00:04:08,580
So, I've told you!

87
00:04:08,580 --> 00:04:11,830
But it's only for 1 or 2 days

88
00:04:11,830 --> 00:04:13,600
It's wrong!

89
00:04:14,540 --> 00:04:15,600
You don't want?

90
00:04:17,040 --> 00:04:20,680
To tell the truth,

91
00:04:21,100 --> 00:04:22,900
I think that...

92
00:04:23,550 --> 00:04:26,050
It's the last chance

93
00:04:29,450 --> 00:04:33,100
What's the last chance?

94
00:04:33,100 --> 00:04:40,290
I'd like to become stable and lead a good life

95
00:04:40,820 --> 00:04:42,400
If so, just come at my house!

96
00:04:43,760 --> 00:04:44,600
The problem,

97
00:04:44,750 --> 00:04:48,840
it's how your mother will think of it

98
00:04:48,840 --> 00:04:50,100
None of her business

99
00:04:50,100 --> 00:04:50,770
And!

100
00:04:54,580 --> 00:05:01,100
Me...I don't have a daddy

101
00:05:08,050 --> 00:05:10,300
How the matter concern me?

102
00:05:15,200 --> 00:05:17,910
So I look upon you

103
00:05:24,600 --> 00:05:25,730
Tell me!

104
00:05:27,800 --> 00:05:31,290
What are you waiting?

105
00:05:31,740 --> 00:05:34,900
It's so strange...

106
00:05:35,600 --> 00:05:40,570
Like I expect that you say something

107
00:05:40,570 --> 00:05:44,420
In fact, I already know it vaguely

108
00:05:45,900 --> 00:05:47,800
A little embarrassing

109
00:05:48,400 --> 00:05:51,400
So I look upon you as...

110
00:05:53,650 --> 00:05:55,520
daddy...

111
00:05:56,850 --> 00:05:57,850
Daddy...

112
00:05:59,100 --> 00:06:04,300
It's strange that I say it, but

113
00:06:04,700 --> 00:06:10,530
If we start living together, I'll be so

114
00:06:13,860 --> 00:06:21,150
It's a little awkward that I sell myself

115
00:06:21,150 --> 00:06:23,530
But anyway, daddy

116
00:06:25,600 --> 00:06:27,790
Nice daddy...

117
00:06:29,360 --> 00:06:31,890
I'll be so, fortunately or unfortunately

118
00:06:32,600 --> 00:06:33,800
Oh, yes?

119
00:06:34,020 --> 00:06:35,400
So, it's good!

120
00:06:36,000 --> 00:06:37,700
Yes, but...

121
00:06:38,430 --> 00:06:39,800
It will not go well

122
00:06:40,200 --> 00:06:41,200
No!

123
00:06:41,200 --> 00:06:44,580
I will ask again to mummy

124
00:06:46,200 --> 00:06:47,250
I'll say it!

125
00:06:47,250 --> 00:06:49,600
I'm anxious about one thing

126
00:06:49,820 --> 00:06:51,270
How should I think that

127
00:06:51,270 --> 00:06:54,450
You don't have a daddy?

128
00:06:54,850 --> 00:06:56,200
I doubt it

129
00:06:58,250 --> 00:06:59,700
What does it mean?

130
00:06:59,950 --> 00:07:01,300
After all

131
00:07:03,950 --> 00:07:05,770
It's not good to tell it to you

132
00:07:05,770 --> 00:07:07,600
What? Tell me!

133
00:07:08,400 --> 00:07:09,760
What?

134
00:07:10,600 --> 00:07:12,200
You step on my foot

135
00:07:14,200 --> 00:07:16,430
I'll say something like this!

136
00:07:23,280 --> 00:07:25,100
I'll say when I notice

137
00:07:26,100 --> 00:07:28,500
I have a side like this

138
00:07:28,500 --> 00:07:29,200
Yes

139
00:07:31,040 --> 00:07:36,220
It's not good to say it in front of a child

140
00:07:36,220 --> 00:07:38,220
But it's better to clarify

141
00:07:38,220 --> 00:07:40,500
I say all to you

142
00:07:41,000 --> 00:07:42,100
Uncle say it

143
00:07:42,390 --> 00:07:44,680
You know

144
00:07:45,390 --> 00:07:46,350
Uncle

145
00:07:46,350 --> 00:07:56,450
Will be on intimate terms with your mummy

146
00:07:58,580 --> 00:08:00,460
I don't understand

147
00:08:00,460 --> 00:08:02,730
What means the intimate terms

148
00:08:02,730 --> 00:08:05,300
If you'll be her friend, it's nice

149
00:08:05,300 --> 00:08:06,800
That's not

150
00:08:08,650 --> 00:08:10,600
You know, in brief

151
00:08:11,600 --> 00:08:15,600
For a  long time, I'm not a man

152
00:08:19,710 --> 00:08:23,200
It's bad, I explain badly

153
00:08:23,700 --> 00:08:27,600
Uncle doesn't fulfill his function

154
00:08:28,310 --> 00:08:29,450
Recently

155
00:08:37,760 --> 00:08:42,550
But if I see your mummy, "with her..."

156
00:08:44,200 --> 00:08:45,250
It can happen

157
00:08:46,000 --> 00:08:47,800
Ok, I say it!

158
00:08:48,020 --> 00:08:50,400
You didn't understand

159
00:08:51,600 --> 00:08:52,800
A sexual desire

160
00:08:54,300 --> 00:08:55,250
Sexual desire?

161
00:08:55,250 --> 00:08:56,990
I have a strong sexual desire

162
00:09:01,740 --> 00:09:04,500
You can make friends  with my mummy

163
00:09:05,470 --> 00:09:06,500
Yes, I can

164
00:09:06,500 --> 00:09:07,800
So, that's good

165
00:09:10,000 --> 00:09:11,720
I say it, really

166
00:09:11,720 --> 00:09:12,900
Perfectly

167
00:09:14,350 --> 00:09:15,850
You can

168
00:09:15,850 --> 00:09:19,000
Don't say to others

169
00:09:19,890 --> 00:09:21,100
I am...

170
00:09:21,540 --> 00:09:22,600
Dirty pig
