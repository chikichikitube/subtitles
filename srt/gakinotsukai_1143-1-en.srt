00:00:00,000 --> 00:01:00,000
@ShibataBread

00:00:00,000 --> 00:01:00,000
@TofuPizza

3
00:00:00,380 --> 00:00:04,050
The King of Bikkuri Face Grand Prix!!

4
00:00:04,350 --> 00:00:12,660
Grand Prix

5
00:00:04,350 --> 00:00:12,660
The King of Bikkuri Face

6
00:00:24,540 --> 00:00:27,340
Downtown

7
00:00:24,540 --> 00:00:27,340
Hitoshi Matsumoto

8
00:00:24,540 --> 00:00:27,340
Masatoshi Hamada

9
00:00:24,600 --> 00:00:25,600
On today's show...

10
00:00:25,940 --> 00:00:27,140
as he just announced,

11
00:00:27,140 --> 00:00:27,810
Yea?

12
00:00:27,810 --> 00:00:30,540
We will decide who will be the Bikkuri Face King.

13
00:00:30,540 --> 00:00:32,240
See the drawing of us back there?

14
00:00:32,240 --> 00:00:33,250
Isn't that something?

15
00:00:34,080 --> 00:00:35,750
You know who drew this?

16
00:00:36,450 --> 00:00:38,120
It's by Mr. Umezu himself.

17
00:00:37,250 --> 00:00:38,120
That's right.

18
00:00:37,650 --> 00:00:40,990
Illustration by Kazuo Umezu

19
00:00:38,380 --> 00:00:39,380
Mr. Kazuo Umezu.

20
00:00:39,380 --> 00:00:40,120
Right.

21
00:00:40,450 --> 00:00:42,390
I'm sure he wasn't expecting

22
00:00:42,390 --> 00:00:45,520
such a weak reaction from you guys.

23
00:00:45,520 --> 00:00:46,320
No need to point that out.

24
00:00:47,260 --> 00:00:49,060
Let's get to the show then.

25
00:00:49,060 --> 00:00:51,260
Here's how you will judge each contestant.

26
00:00:51,530 --> 00:00:53,330
So I'll judge five elements of each act.

27
00:00:53,470 --> 00:00:56,400
As shown in this pentagon graph.

28
00:00:56,600 --> 00:00:58,600
First is "How Much You Shit Yourself"

29
00:00:58,700 --> 00:00:59,870
It's a facial expression contest,

30
00:00:59,870 --> 00:01:02,640
but I still want to see your whole body react.

31
00:01:02,640 --> 00:01:05,140
Like, "Did he just throw his back out?"

32
00:01:04,510 --> 00:01:05,140
That much?

33
00:01:05,210 --> 00:01:06,510
Yes, I'd like that.

34
00:01:06,510 --> 00:01:07,250
I see.

35
00:01:07,250 --> 00:01:09,510
And this should be obvious but,

36
00:01:09,780 --> 00:01:11,920
"How Well You Hide The Show"

37
00:01:11,920 --> 00:01:13,850
That's the toughest to judge.

38
00:01:13,850 --> 00:01:15,520
We've had contestants in the past

39
00:01:15,520 --> 00:01:17,920
who exposed the show.

40
00:01:17,920 --> 00:01:18,990
And that's no good

41
00:01:18,990 --> 00:01:20,390
And we have...

42
00:01:20,390 --> 00:01:21,860
"E-Eye Pop...

43
00:01:24,130 --> 00:01:26,060
"Eye Pop & Dislocated Jaw..."

44
00:01:26,530 --> 00:01:29,100
Sort of like Dolce & Gabbana...

45
00:01:27,930 --> 00:01:29,070
Hell no.

46
00:01:29,330 --> 00:01:30,200
Please explain.

47
00:01:30,600 --> 00:01:32,070
It's part of the facial expression.

48
00:01:32,070 --> 00:01:33,610
Like, "Shit, his eyes are about to pop out!"

49
00:01:33,610 --> 00:01:35,470
or "His jaw just dislocated!"

50
00:01:35,610 --> 00:01:37,240
And this needs no explanation...

51
00:01:37,240 --> 00:01:38,240
N.B.T.

52
00:01:38,240 --> 00:01:39,340
What the hell is that?

53
00:01:39,810 --> 00:01:41,650
What does N.B.T. stand for?

54
00:01:41,650 --> 00:01:43,420
Nice Bikkuri Timing...

55
00:01:43,450 --> 00:01:45,380
You had to read it, too, asshole.

56
00:01:45,580 --> 00:01:54,090
"Eye Pop & Dislocated Jaw"

57
00:01:45,580 --> 00:01:54,090
"Prank Not Exposed"

58
00:01:45,580 --> 00:01:54,090
"Shitting Pants Percentage"

59
00:01:45,580 --> 00:01:54,090
5 Judging Elements

60
00:01:45,580 --> 00:01:54,090
Bikkuri Minutes

61
00:01:45,580 --> 00:01:54,090
Bikkuri Minutes

62
00:01:45,580 --> 00:01:54,090
Challenge Ending Signal

63
00:01:45,580 --> 00:01:54,090
Judged on length of Bikkuri Face

64
00:01:45,580 --> 00:01:54,090
Loud scream by each challenger

65
00:01:46,650 --> 00:01:48,450
The last judging element is

66
00:01:48,590 --> 00:01:49,720
"Bikkuri Minutes."

67
00:01:50,320 --> 00:01:53,660
The act is over once the challenger lets out a big scream.

68
00:01:54,130 --> 00:01:55,130
Let's start the show.

69
00:01:55,130 --> 00:01:56,660
Here's our firs challenger...

70
00:01:56,660 --> 00:01:57,730
C'mon out!

71
00:02:06,740 --> 00:02:11,810
(OGIYAHAGI)

72
00:02:06,740 --> 00:02:11,810
Challenger

73
00:02:06,740 --> 00:02:11,810
Hiroaki Ogi

74
00:02:11,140 --> 00:02:11,840
You're Ogi?

75
00:02:11,840 --> 00:02:13,610
He's the lead-off challenger.

76
00:02:13,610 --> 00:02:14,350
Yes, I made it.

77
00:02:14,350 --> 00:02:15,010
Good job.

78
00:02:15,010 --> 00:02:17,120
This is my first time leading the show...

79
00:02:17,120 --> 00:02:17,720
Not only that,

80
00:02:17,720 --> 00:02:20,250
You're the first with leopard-printed frames.

81
00:02:20,450 --> 00:02:22,050
They aren't quite leopard...

82
00:02:21,120 --> 00:02:22,050
Oh, they're not?

83
00:02:35,500 --> 00:02:36,900
A skilled player

84
00:02:36,900 --> 00:02:39,810
a bespectacled master, ready for the challenge!

85
00:02:40,010 --> 00:02:47,910
19-Year Veteran Comic

86
00:02:40,010 --> 00:02:47,910
Dinner

87
00:02:40,010 --> 00:02:47,910
Kazuya Kojima

88
00:02:40,010 --> 00:02:47,910
Ogi

89
00:02:40,010 --> 00:02:47,910
Ogiyahagi

90
00:02:40,010 --> 00:02:47,910
Setup

91
00:02:40,010 --> 00:02:47,910
Target

92
00:02:40,810 --> 00:02:43,010
His target is Mr. Kojima,

93
00:02:43,010 --> 00:02:44,110
a seasoned comic

94
00:02:44,510 --> 00:02:47,510
Does Ogi have a strategy?

95
00:02:48,410 --> 00:02:50,920
Well, Kojima's very slow and...

96
00:02:50,920 --> 00:02:53,050
Just not a smart person.

97
00:02:53,290 --> 00:02:55,890
You'll see, he's not very observant.

98
00:02:54,990 --> 00:02:55,690
I see.

99
00:02:55,890 --> 00:02:57,090
So, I feel like...

100
00:02:57,190 --> 00:02:58,490
He might win this.

101
00:02:57,490 --> 00:03:00,730
I can get away with a lot.

102
00:02:58,590 --> 00:02:59,390
He's going for it.

103
00:03:00,090 --> 00:03:01,390
I see.

104
00:03:00,730 --> 00:03:02,030
I'm just gonna go for the gold.

105
00:03:02,160 --> 00:03:06,470
Start

106
00:03:02,160 --> 00:03:06,470
The king of Bikkuri Face

107
00:03:07,700 --> 00:03:09,800
Ogi looks ready after doing some stretches.

108
00:03:10,400 --> 00:03:14,310
It must be nerve-wracking.

109
00:03:10,500 --> 00:03:14,210
As his target arrives, Ogi makes his move.

110
00:03:14,310 --> 00:03:14,740
I concur.

111
00:03:14,710 --> 00:03:17,110
Excuse me.

112
00:03:25,020 --> 00:03:26,820
Dungaree.

113
00:03:26,320 --> 00:03:27,190
- Huh?

114
00:03:26,820 --> 00:03:27,990
Got your Dungarees on?

115
00:03:27,990 --> 00:03:29,490
What do you mean, Dungaree?

116
00:03:29,490 --> 00:03:31,260
Talking about your shirt.

117
00:03:30,190 --> 00:03:31,260
- Oh, right.

118
00:03:33,090 --> 00:03:34,490
You reserved this table just for us?

119
00:03:34,790 --> 00:03:37,500
Everything else was booked.

120
00:03:38,730 --> 00:03:39,730
What are you getting?

121
00:03:39,730 --> 00:03:40,530
Meat?

122
00:03:40,530 --> 00:03:42,800
Oh, I want fried rice.

123
00:03:41,770 --> 00:03:45,500
That was quick.

124
00:03:42,800 --> 00:03:45,500
Braised Pork Belly looks good too.

125
00:03:45,540 --> 00:03:49,970
Shark Fin Soup is 1,800 yen.

126
00:03:47,210 --> 00:03:48,410
1,800 yen?!!

127
00:03:50,510 --> 00:03:51,610
Very natural.

128
00:03:51,010 --> 00:03:52,310
Very good.

129
00:03:53,010 --> 00:03:54,210
Nice flow.

130
00:03:53,110 --> 00:03:54,910
I guess that's normal.

131
00:03:54,210 --> 00:03:55,210
That was good.

132
00:03:55,210 --> 00:03:56,620
That's what I'm talking about.

133
00:03:55,210 --> 00:03:58,020
How about Mapo Tofu?

134
00:03:57,220 --> 00:03:58,020
I called it Poma.

135
00:03:58,520 --> 00:04:00,020
Poma?!

136
00:04:00,520 --> 00:04:01,620
Yes, Poma...

137
00:04:01,990 --> 00:04:02,790
Good one.

138
00:04:04,490 --> 00:04:05,590
He has zero idea...

139
00:04:05,090 --> 00:04:05,990
Not a clue.

140
00:04:06,890 --> 00:04:09,590
As Ogi predicted, Kojima is utterly clueless.

141
00:04:10,100 --> 00:04:12,900
Ogi cruises along without getting caught.

142
00:04:12,400 --> 00:04:13,700
Good so far.

143
00:04:13,830 --> 00:04:15,100
So how are

144
00:04:15,100 --> 00:04:16,100
your gigs going?

145
00:04:16,370 --> 00:04:18,300
Just had an amazing show.

146
00:04:17,500 --> 00:04:18,300
Which was?

147
00:04:18,300 --> 00:04:19,670
The show is called "Music Lovers."

148
00:04:20,010 --> 00:04:22,210
"Music Lovers"? Refresh my memory.

149
00:04:22,210 --> 00:04:23,610
What do you do?

150
00:04:23,610 --> 00:04:24,710
I was one of the supporters

151
00:04:24,710 --> 00:04:25,910
Oh, you get to cheer'em on.

152
00:04:25,910 --> 00:04:28,110
I didn't do much more than clap my hands.

153
00:04:29,150 --> 00:04:30,710
They were so cool though.

154
00:04:31,050 --> 00:04:37,420
What made them so cool?

155
00:04:32,420 --> 00:04:37,420
Their looks...

156
00:04:37,290 --> 00:04:38,590
Now you've done it.

157
00:04:39,390 --> 00:04:41,590
I see. You used a prop.

158
00:04:41,590 --> 00:04:43,300
Right, more than just a facial expression.

159
00:04:41,930 --> 00:04:43,300
When our eyes met,

160
00:04:43,300 --> 00:04:46,400
I waved at'em.

161
00:04:46,400 --> 00:04:55,170
You were directed to do so, right?

162
00:04:47,130 --> 00:04:48,100
Directed...?

163
00:04:48,100 --> 00:04:50,300
Not really.

164
00:04:50,840 --> 00:04:55,170
Why're you pissed?

165
00:04:51,800 --> 00:04:54,510
I don't think that's a Bikkuri face.

166
00:04:54,510 --> 00:04:57,110
Well, he rarely makes that face.

167
00:04:55,910 --> 00:04:59,880
I was surrounded by all these girls,

168
00:04:57,610 --> 00:04:59,840
and became one of them.

169
00:04:59,840 --> 00:05:05,980
As for me, I react more with experienced comics,

170
00:05:04,380 --> 00:05:06,020
I'm more like "OH!!"

171
00:05:06,020 --> 00:05:11,860
Like Takeshi and Sanma...

172
00:05:09,320 --> 00:05:11,860
Or if it's Downtown, you'd be like, "Oh!!"

173
00:05:10,990 --> 00:05:11,890
Yes, of course.

174
00:05:11,990 --> 00:05:20,130
Like who?

175
00:05:13,760 --> 00:05:20,130
Well, let's say I met Downtown...

176
00:05:18,300 --> 00:05:22,100
I don't know about this one...

177
00:05:21,200 --> 00:05:22,400
You wouldn't be like, "Ah?!"

178
00:05:22,400 --> 00:05:23,500
Yeah, like that, too.

179
00:05:23,530 --> 00:05:28,410
What about with Unnan?

180
00:05:28,440 --> 00:05:29,710
What sort of emotion is that?

181
00:05:30,010 --> 00:05:31,410
How does he not know?!

182
00:05:33,710 --> 00:05:35,210
It changed a bit.

183
00:05:35,210 --> 00:05:36,420
What about with Sanma?

184
00:05:36,520 --> 00:05:38,320
And with Downtown?

185
00:05:37,720 --> 00:05:39,220
Now, he's just messing around.

186
00:05:39,220 --> 00:05:41,120
What the hell?!

187
00:05:43,020 --> 00:05:46,090
What about with Ame-Agari?

188
00:05:45,490 --> 00:05:46,990
-So they got the biggest reaction.

189
00:05:48,190 --> 00:05:49,900
50 minutes have passed.

190
00:05:50,300 --> 00:05:53,000
Ogi doesn't show any sign of slowing down.

191
00:05:53,300 --> 00:05:54,500
Excuse us.

192
00:05:55,000 --> 00:05:58,540
May I get another drink?

193
00:05:56,300 --> 00:05:57,500
- Coming right up, sir.

194
00:05:57,500 --> 00:05:58,540
Oolong tea for me.

195
00:05:58,540 --> 00:06:00,810
Oolong tea?!

196
00:06:01,110 --> 00:06:02,210
Why're you yelling?

197
00:06:01,710 --> 00:06:02,710
Nothing wrong with tea.

198
00:06:02,770 --> 00:06:07,810
Give me some tips on food reporting.

199
00:06:05,810 --> 00:06:07,010
Amazing that he doesn't know

200
00:06:07,010 --> 00:06:08,010
Right.

201
00:06:08,080 --> 00:06:09,180
I have food show gig coming up.

202
00:06:11,220 --> 00:06:13,420
Say things like, "Great texture!"

203
00:06:17,690 --> 00:06:20,360
WTF?! That ain't no Bikkuri face!!

204
00:06:19,960 --> 00:06:21,960
He has shown a variety of reactions,

205
00:06:22,160 --> 00:06:24,460
but to be the champion,

206
00:06:24,460 --> 00:06:26,380
he must end with a bang.

207
00:06:26,060 --> 00:06:27,360
Of course.

208
00:06:27,360 --> 00:06:29,670
Ogi makes his move for the last big finish.

209
00:06:30,670 --> 00:06:32,370
I almost forgot

210
00:06:33,170 --> 00:06:39,110
You know that television show?

211
00:06:36,110 --> 00:06:37,210
The name escapes me...

212
00:06:37,770 --> 00:06:39,110
It's called "Gaman TV".

213
00:06:39,180 --> 00:06:41,240
Like an endurance test?

214
00:06:39,910 --> 00:06:41,210
Yea, and it usually involves pain.

215
00:06:41,240 --> 00:06:46,220
So I'll be using that paint brush over there

216
00:06:46,950 --> 00:06:57,360
They'll tickle me everywhere with the brush.
And I'll have to endure it.

217
00:06:54,690 --> 00:06:57,430
They judge who tolerates it the best?

218
00:06:57,600 --> 00:06:59,400
Yeah, so I was thinking you can help me...

219
00:06:59,400 --> 00:07:00,500
B-But why?

220
00:07:02,300 --> 00:07:04,300
Give it to me then.

221
00:07:06,810 --> 00:07:09,210
Kojima unknowingly becomes part of Ogi's act.

222
00:07:10,310 --> 00:07:12,510
What kind of Bikkuri face will Ogi make?

223
00:07:13,410 --> 00:07:14,410
Ready?

224
00:07:20,320 --> 00:07:21,520
What the hell?!

225
00:07:23,060 --> 00:07:25,790
You're gonna lose.

226
00:07:25,920 --> 00:07:26,830
What're you doing?

227
00:07:26,830 --> 00:07:27,290
I don't know...

228
00:07:27,290 --> 00:07:30,630
I don't think you're trying.

229
00:07:28,730 --> 00:07:30,630
- Maybe, I should stand up.

230
00:07:31,600 --> 00:07:32,800
Seriously...

231
00:07:33,200 --> 00:07:34,700
Okay, go ahead.

232
00:07:35,300 --> 00:07:36,500
Go for my neck.

233
00:07:41,710 --> 00:07:42,710
Shut the hell up.

234
00:07:43,110 --> 00:07:44,110
Do it again, again, again, and again!!

235
00:07:47,510 --> 00:07:49,510
Do it again, again, again, and again!!

236
00:07:50,020 --> 00:07:51,020
Do more!

237
00:07:51,020 --> 00:07:52,920
Do it now. Do it now!!

238
00:07:55,820 --> 00:07:56,820
Hurry up!

239
00:07:59,320 --> 00:08:03,330
Cut it ou, pervert!!

240
00:08:00,030 --> 00:08:01,130
Tough to score this one.

241
00:08:02,330 --> 00:08:03,300
Oh, is over.

242
00:08:03,690 --> 00:08:10,700
Over

243
00:08:03,690 --> 00:08:10,700
The King of Bikkuri Face

244
00:08:04,400 --> 00:08:05,400
Keep it down.

245
00:08:04,900 --> 00:08:06,800
You cut it out.

246
00:08:09,900 --> 00:08:10,900
Listen, Ogi.

247
00:08:10,900 --> 00:08:13,270
You were just playing games at the end.

248
00:08:13,270 --> 00:08:15,810
Kojima's seriously slow.

249
00:08:15,910 --> 00:08:18,310
I'd say he had no idea.

250
00:08:18,310 --> 00:08:20,210
I get that but...

251
00:08:20,810 --> 00:08:21,610
Let's see his scores.

252
00:08:21,610 --> 00:08:22,910
Here they are.

253
00:08:22,910 --> 00:08:26,020
He's perfect on not exposing the show.

254
00:08:26,420 --> 00:08:28,420
Kojima still hasn't figured it out.

255
00:08:27,620 --> 00:08:28,420
I agree.

256
00:08:28,620 --> 00:08:31,120
Even after this airs, he will have no idea.

257
00:08:31,120 --> 00:08:33,120
But the "Eye Pop & ...

258
00:08:33,120 --> 00:08:35,930
Dislocated Jaw" could've been better.

259
00:08:36,230 --> 00:08:37,430
This one's pretty high...

260
00:08:37,430 --> 00:08:39,400
Well, his timing was...

261
00:08:38,300 --> 00:08:39,400
What's this stand for again?

262
00:08:39,400 --> 00:08:41,200
"Nice Bikkuri Timing."

263
00:08:41,300 --> 00:08:42,700
N.B.T.

264
00:08:41,800 --> 00:08:42,600
Got it.

265
00:08:42,600 --> 00:08:44,600
Let's see how the others do.

266
00:08:44,600 --> 00:08:46,610
Looking forward to it.

267
00:08:45,800 --> 00:08:47,670
Let's see who's up next!!

268
00:08:55,950 --> 00:08:59,620
Challenger

269
00:08:55,950 --> 00:08:59,620
Takayuki Kinoshita

270
00:09:00,320 --> 00:09:02,050
Crack!

271
00:09:01,420 --> 00:09:02,020
What?!

272
00:09:03,220 --> 00:09:04,720
How dare you...

273
00:09:06,220 --> 00:09:08,430
You just had to break the last step!

274
00:09:09,730 --> 00:09:11,530
Jeez...

275
00:09:12,400 --> 00:09:15,200
Kinoshita, with his chameleon-like ability,

276
00:09:15,200 --> 00:09:16,670
is ready for the challenge!

277
00:09:16,670 --> 00:09:24,010
Dinner

278
00:09:16,670 --> 00:09:24,010
Keiko Kinoshita

279
00:09:16,670 --> 00:09:24,010
Kinoshita

280
00:09:16,670 --> 00:09:24,010
Setup

281
00:09:16,670 --> 00:09:24,010
Target

282
00:09:17,900 --> 00:09:21,310
His target is his sister Keiko who resides in Osaka.

283
00:09:22,910 --> 00:09:24,010
And who else?

284
00:09:25,710 --> 00:09:27,710
To make his sister feel more comfortable,

285
00:09:27,910 --> 00:09:30,120
their mother Sadako will be Kinoshita's partner in crime.

286
00:09:30,450 --> 00:09:33,780
Let's act the same as any other family gathering!!

287
00:09:33,780 --> 00:09:34,820
Okay

288
00:09:34,380 --> 00:09:34,880
Let's do this!

289
00:09:35,050 --> 00:09:40,690
Start

290
00:09:35,050 --> 00:09:40,690
The King of Bikkuri Face

291
00:09:37,520 --> 00:09:39,520
Mother and son wait for Keiko's arrival.

292
00:09:41,330 --> 00:09:44,530
But something is wrong with Kinoshita...

293
00:09:44,530 --> 00:09:49,760
Aren't you hungry?

294
00:09:46,860 --> 00:09:49,830
I don't feel like eating...

295
00:09:49,830 --> 00:09:53,740
Are you nervous?

296
00:09:51,300 --> 00:09:53,740
Yea, it's a strange feeling...

297
00:09:53,900 --> 00:09:55,000
I can sort of understand...

298
00:09:53,940 --> 00:09:56,810
(Chuckles) Hilarious!!

299
00:09:57,610 --> 00:10:01,210
His mom enjoys the fact that her son is really nervous.

300
00:10:01,510 --> 00:10:02,710
And then...

301
00:10:03,880 --> 00:10:06,980
Oh!! There she is!!

302
00:10:06,980 --> 00:10:10,890
This is a surprisingly gorgeous room...

303
00:10:08,720 --> 00:10:10,720
- You made it just in time...

304
00:10:11,020 --> 00:10:12,620
She said "surprisingly"...

305
00:10:13,520 --> 00:10:14,420
Right off the bat.

306
00:10:14,420 --> 00:10:15,320
You just arrived in Tokyo?

307
00:10:15,720 --> 00:10:17,260
Yea, literally just arrived.

308
00:10:17,260 --> 00:10:20,100
Where's your manager?

309
00:10:19,130 --> 00:10:20,230
- He's not here.

310
00:10:20,230 --> 00:10:21,230
It's just us three tonight

311
00:10:21,230 --> 00:10:22,060
Is that so?!

312
00:10:23,500 --> 00:10:25,000
Just after Keiko's arrival,

313
00:10:25,200 --> 00:10:27,000
Kinoshita finds an opportunity to strike.

314
00:10:28,100 --> 00:10:29,400
What's that?

315
00:10:30,010 --> 00:10:32,610
It's for Valentines's day...

316
00:10:32,610 --> 00:10:34,410
It's for the two of you...

317
00:10:37,610 --> 00:10:38,710
Long face time.

318
00:10:38,410 --> 00:10:43,520
They're for you and your manager.

319
00:10:39,410 --> 00:10:40,620
Too long.

320
00:10:41,420 --> 00:10:42,620
- Thanks, I'll take them now.

321
00:10:48,060 --> 00:10:49,630
There they are!

322
00:10:51,530 --> 00:10:53,430
I respect your old-school Bikkuri reaction.

323
00:10:53,930 --> 00:10:55,330
So he's doing it right now?

324
00:10:55,330 --> 00:10:56,600
Yes, it's game on.

325
00:10:56,800 --> 00:10:57,800
Traditional style.

326
00:10:59,900 --> 00:11:01,300
Thank you very much.

327
00:11:00,240 --> 00:11:02,470
Could you take a picture of us, please?

328
00:11:02,500 --> 00:11:03,510
Yes, ma'am.

329
00:11:03,510 --> 00:11:05,410
I see. A family photo.

330
00:11:05,410 --> 00:11:06,710
Thank you.

331
00:11:06,710 --> 00:11:07,310
Take one from here.

332
00:11:07,310 --> 00:11:08,110
Okay.

333
00:11:10,610 --> 00:11:11,710
I don't know...

334
00:11:11,710 --> 00:11:12,920
If this should count.

335
00:11:12,920 --> 00:11:13,720
Thank you.

336
00:11:13,720 --> 00:11:14,620
Here it is.

337
00:11:14,620 --> 00:11:15,420
Thank you.

338
00:11:16,220 --> 00:11:17,920
Thank you very much.

339
00:11:18,620 --> 00:11:19,520
They look delicious.

340
00:11:19,920 --> 00:11:24,560
Sister

341
00:11:26,730 --> 00:11:27,630
Thanks again.

342
00:11:28,730 --> 00:11:30,230
Keiko has traveled to Tokyo

343
00:11:30,230 --> 00:11:31,500
for a reason.

344
00:11:32,700 --> 00:11:36,400
To showcase her skills as a fortune teller,

345
00:11:37,110 --> 00:11:41,410
we've created a fake show for the two siblings.

346
00:11:42,410 --> 00:11:44,510
Thinking the show is scheduled to tape tomorrow,

347
00:11:44,810 --> 00:11:46,720
she has traveled to Tokyo from Osaka.

348
00:11:47,050 --> 00:11:49,850
I have the script for tomorrow's show.

349
00:11:52,290 --> 00:11:55,020
You'll be reading my fortune in the studio.

350
00:11:55,520 --> 00:11:58,430
And then the unexpected happens...

351
00:11:59,130 --> 00:12:04,800
I usually use one of these to do a reading.

352
00:12:05,100 --> 00:12:08,470
Yaki Imo!

353
00:12:08,470 --> 00:12:13,040
Roasted Sweet Potatoes!

354
00:12:11,210 --> 00:12:13,410
That scared the heck outta me.

355
00:12:14,640 --> 00:12:16,740
Just a mobile sweet potato truck.

356
00:12:16,740 --> 00:12:21,720
In a room like this, I thought it was
some sort of a spirit or ghost.

357
00:12:21,950 --> 00:12:24,190
Why don't you read my fortune?

358
00:12:23,420 --> 00:12:24,220
- O-Okay...

359
00:12:24,190 --> 00:12:24,820
We need to rehearse for the show.

360
00:12:24,720 --> 00:12:29,590
Give me some bad news!

361
00:12:27,220 --> 00:12:29,590
I would say this year, you'll have to...

362
00:12:30,390 --> 00:12:32,990
have to watch yourself in July...

363
00:12:32,990 --> 00:12:36,230
I should work on my reaction to the reading...

364
00:12:35,730 --> 00:12:36,330
- Good idea.

365
00:12:36,330 --> 00:12:38,270
Be careful this month, too.

366
00:12:40,900 --> 00:12:42,300
This is an awesome move.

367
00:12:41,670 --> 00:12:44,070
...so that will be my reaction.

368
00:12:44,810 --> 00:12:47,540
"I should work on my reaction to the reading..."

369
00:12:47,910 --> 00:12:49,710
His excise must have done the trick.

370
00:12:50,010 --> 00:12:51,910
His sister lets the Bikkuri face go.

371
00:12:51,910 --> 00:12:52,710
Of course.

372
00:12:52,910 --> 00:12:54,020
Having succeeded so far,

373
00:12:54,020 --> 00:12:56,320
Kinoshita dares to take the mission further.

374
00:12:56,580 --> 00:12:59,450
How was your vacation in Korea?

375
00:12:58,720 --> 00:12:59,620
...But why?

376
00:12:59,620 --> 00:13:02,120
...because I put down a mattress

377
00:13:02,120 --> 00:13:04,130
between two beds...

378
00:13:04,630 --> 00:13:07,730
And because I couldn't speak the language, I was...

379
00:13:08,030 --> 00:13:15,070
Bikkuri at the Wall

380
00:13:08,930 --> 00:13:10,240
WTF?

381
00:13:10,260 --> 00:13:22,440
Ongoing

382
00:13:14,110 --> 00:13:14,810
Stretch it.

383
00:13:14,810 --> 00:13:15,810
Stretching it.

384
00:13:15,810 --> 00:13:16,710
Taking his chances.

385
00:13:17,210 --> 00:13:18,310
Stretching it thin.

386
00:13:18,310 --> 00:13:19,610
He's still at it.

387
00:13:19,440 --> 00:13:23,610
Do you see a bug?

388
00:13:19,610 --> 00:13:20,710
Still going.

389
00:13:23,610 --> 00:13:31,020
What is it?

390
00:13:25,280 --> 00:13:26,080
That was close.

391
00:13:26,080 --> 00:13:27,580
That was way too close.

392
00:13:28,120 --> 00:13:31,020
I have trouble seeing these days...

393
00:13:31,590 --> 00:13:34,390
This room is kind of creepy...

394
00:13:34,390 --> 00:13:35,090
Oh!

395
00:13:35,090 --> 00:13:36,690
Do you see that thing?

396
00:13:38,730 --> 00:13:40,030
Watch it!

397
00:13:40,030 --> 00:13:41,530
Close call!

398
00:13:40,230 --> 00:13:44,670
They're going for the traditional look.

399
00:13:42,230 --> 00:13:44,800
That's their intent?

400
00:13:45,700 --> 00:13:47,140
It's been two hours since they got together.

401
00:13:47,700 --> 00:13:51,670
Kinoshita, with his mom's help, prepares fir the big finish.

402
00:13:48,140 --> 00:13:49,910
Damn, took him two hours?

403
00:13:49,410 --> 00:13:50,910
Amazing.

404
00:13:52,770 --> 00:13:55,510
Still got stiff shoulders?

405
00:13:53,870 --> 00:13:55,510
Yea, they're very stiff.

406
00:13:55,840 --> 00:13:58,980
I can massage them for you.

407
00:13:56,680 --> 00:13:57,280
- Thanks.

408
00:13:58,120 --> 00:13:59,420
What a dirty trick...

409
00:13:59,720 --> 00:14:01,220
By hiding his face from his sister,

410
00:14:01,520 --> 00:14:03,420
he can accrue more minutes...

411
00:14:02,820 --> 00:14:04,920
He did this the last time around, too.

412
00:14:05,820 --> 00:14:07,530
But his sister's watching...

413
00:14:07,830 --> 00:14:12,130
His the plan falls short as he unexpectedly
attracts her attention.

414
00:14:12,730 --> 00:14:15,470
It looks like his plan isn't going to work, but...

415
00:14:15,460 --> 00:14:18,370
How are your shoulders?

416
00:14:17,230 --> 00:14:18,370
Yea, mine are bad, too.

417
00:14:19,970 --> 00:14:26,210
He's definitely got your shoulders, Mom.

418
00:14:22,000 --> 00:14:23,570
Go for it, don't hold back.

419
00:14:22,240 --> 00:14:23,410
Is that so.

420
00:14:23,710 --> 00:14:26,210
Go for it. Don't be shy. Use your full weight.

421
00:14:27,280 --> 00:14:30,080
Like mother, like son.

422
00:14:30,080 --> 00:14:31,050
Don't say that.

423
00:14:31,050 --> 00:14:35,250
I'm not a fat - pig like him! No way.

424
00:14:35,250 --> 00:14:37,750
Don't put us in the same category.

425
00:14:39,420 --> 00:14:41,130
What's going on here?

426
00:14:42,560 --> 00:14:45,230
Totem Pole!!

427
00:14:46,590 --> 00:14:47,700
I know, right?

428
00:14:47,700 --> 00:14:48,700
It' crazy...

429
00:14:48,700 --> 00:14:49,600
I wasn't expecting this...

430
00:14:49,900 --> 00:14:51,500
You're so thin...

431
00:14:51,500 --> 00:14:52,600
but you're tense.

432
00:14:52,600 --> 00:14:53,400
And with this...

433
00:14:53,400 --> 00:14:54,300
I feel like...

434
00:14:54,300 --> 00:14:55,800
What do you call that?

435
00:14:59,270 --> 00:15:00,470
What the hell?!

436
00:14:59,970 --> 00:15:01,680
Even though I'm very comfortable...

437
00:15:01,880 --> 00:15:02,980
Explain that expression.

438
00:15:03,910 --> 00:15:06,910
What's going on?

439
00:15:03,980 --> 00:15:06,080
Is that Bikkuri face?

440
00:15:10,690 --> 00:15:12,690
His mom needs to cut it out, too.

441
00:15:12,120 --> 00:15:16,590
I have had enough!!

442
00:15:17,330 --> 00:15:19,430
I don't get you...

443
00:15:18,790 --> 00:15:22,400
Over

444
00:15:18,790 --> 00:15:22,400
The King of Bikkuri Face

445
00:15:20,630 --> 00:15:22,330
What was that all about?

446
00:15:22,630 --> 00:15:25,330
You just had a nice dinner with your family...

447
00:15:25,670 --> 00:15:28,440
Your sister was like, "What's going on?" a few times.

448
00:15:27,640 --> 00:15:30,240
It got sketchy when you started staring at the bug.

449
00:15:30,440 --> 00:15:32,610
Could you present his scores, Matsumoto?

450
00:15:32,610 --> 00:15:35,310
High score on "Bikkuri Minutes."

451
00:15:35,910 --> 00:15:37,310
But other than that...

452
00:15:37,310 --> 00:15:40,510
I felt like your Mom helped you out a lot...

453
00:15:40,620 --> 00:15:44,120
When my fortune said I needed to be careful this month,

454
00:15:44,120 --> 00:15:47,020
My Mom was seriously like, "Oh shit!"

455
00:15:47,020 --> 00:15:48,920
A very normal maternal reaction.

456
00:15:49,190 --> 00:15:50,220
Let's move on.

457
00:15:50,220 --> 00:15:51,530
Next challenger, c'mon out!!

458
00:15:58,970 --> 00:16:04,510
(Cocorico)

459
00:15:58,970 --> 00:16:04,510
Challenger

460
00:15:58,970 --> 00:16:04,510
Naoki Tanaka

461
00:15:58,970 --> 00:16:04,510
Shozo Endo

462
00:16:04,840 --> 00:16:06,140
Thanks for having us.

463
00:16:05,570 --> 00:16:07,440
They did the challenge together again.

464
00:16:07,110 --> 00:16:07,910
Yes!

465
00:16:07,910 --> 00:16:09,910
So you've decided to only participate as a duo?

466
00:16:09,910 --> 00:16:14,010
Yes, we got permission.

467
00:16:11,710 --> 00:16:12,710
Yes.

468
00:16:12,710 --> 00:16:14,010
You had to get it approved?

469
00:16:14,280 --> 00:16:19,420
Did you have to say,

470
00:16:15,520 --> 00:16:19,420
"Pwease?"

471
00:16:20,720 --> 00:16:23,020
One part unique talent and one part "pwease"...

472
00:16:23,020 --> 00:16:25,330
It's Cocorico, here they come!

473
00:16:25,890 --> 00:16:33,770
Cocorico

474
00:16:25,890 --> 00:16:33,770
Dai Wen Chi

475
00:16:25,890 --> 00:16:33,770
Kiyoshi Hiraiwa

476
00:16:25,890 --> 00:16:33,770
Metting to Discuss Overseas Business

477
00:16:25,890 --> 00:16:33,770
Overseas Business Worker

478
00:16:25,890 --> 00:16:33,770
Overseas Business Worker

479
00:16:25,890 --> 00:16:33,770
Setup

480
00:16:25,890 --> 00:16:33,770
Target

481
00:16:26,930 --> 00:16:29,760
Cocorico's targets are overseas business coordinators

482
00:16:29,760 --> 00:16:31,260
who have been summoned for a meeting

483
00:16:31,260 --> 00:16:33,600
to discuss Cocorico's future in other Asian markets.

484
00:16:33,870 --> 00:16:37,770
Please watch our superb collaboration.

485
00:16:37,770 --> 00:16:38,570
Yes.

486
00:16:37,870 --> 00:16:39,570
We'll do our best

487
00:16:39,570 --> 00:16:41,540
to focus on our one-two punches.

488
00:16:41,570 --> 00:16:45,780
Start

489
00:16:41,570 --> 00:16:45,780
The King of  Bikkuri face

490
00:16:47,320 --> 00:16:50,980
Endo waits alone for his targets to arrive

491
00:16:52,750 --> 00:16:54,420
What's up?

492
00:16:54,960 --> 00:16:56,160
Oh, hi there.

493
00:16:56,160 --> 00:16:57,160
- Hi there.
- Good evening.

494
00:16:57,160 --> 00:16:58,060
Pleasure to meet you.

495
00:16:59,160 --> 00:17:02,460
Endo notices there's something up with his target.

496
00:17:03,360 --> 00:17:06,830
Are you a little drunk?

497
00:17:10,370 --> 00:17:13,170
As the tipsy target settles in,

498
00:17:14,870 --> 00:17:16,540
Tanaka shows up.

499
00:17:18,280 --> 00:17:21,720
Man, it's cold.

500
00:17:20,180 --> 00:17:21,720
What do you mean you're cold?!

501
00:17:21,720 --> 00:17:23,720
Where's your freaking manners?!

502
00:17:24,680 --> 00:17:28,620
Tanaka

503
00:17:28,560 --> 00:17:29,460
Is that a Bikkuri face?

504
00:17:29,460 --> 00:17:31,560
I'm very sorry that I'm late...

505
00:17:31,760 --> 00:17:33,460
I don't think that should count.

506
00:17:33,060 --> 00:17:35,230
Here's Dai-san's business card.

507
00:17:34,360 --> 00:17:35,560
- Oh, that's hers?

508
00:17:35,760 --> 00:17:36,760
- I see.

509
00:17:36,200 --> 00:17:39,170
How do you read your first name?

510
00:17:37,870 --> 00:17:39,270
- Um...

511
00:17:39,270 --> 00:17:42,040
My first name is pronounced Wen-Chi.

512
00:17:42,040 --> 00:17:44,870
It roughly means "beautiful cloud" in Chinese.

513
00:17:46,170 --> 00:17:47,270
I like it.

514
00:17:47,910 --> 00:17:49,610
I see, beautiful cloud.

515
00:17:49,180 --> 00:17:49,680
- What a coll name.

516
00:17:49,940 --> 00:17:51,240
Beautiful name.

517
00:17:51,580 --> 00:17:57,250
How do you think Japanese comedy
would do in Shanghai?,

518
00:17:57,250 --> 00:18:01,050
It goes without saying, but the language will be the challenge.

519
00:18:01,150 --> 00:18:03,620
Ni hao.

520
00:18:02,160 --> 00:18:02,760
- Ni hao.

521
00:18:04,660 --> 00:18:07,960
Suddenly, Tanaka starts speaking in Chinese.

522
00:18:06,860 --> 00:18:08,960
I remember you studied Chinese for a while.

523
00:18:08,090 --> 00:18:11,560
How old are you?

524
00:18:11,560 --> 00:18:15,640
I'll be 26 this year,
and how about you?

525
00:18:13,670 --> 00:18:17,600
Endo

526
00:18:15,640 --> 00:18:20,970
I'll be 41 this year.

527
00:18:17,600 --> 00:18:37,860
Ongoing

528
00:18:17,770 --> 00:18:19,370
Too long, too long.

529
00:18:19,370 --> 00:18:20,570
Too long.

530
00:18:21,370 --> 00:18:22,680
He's still at it!

531
00:18:22,680 --> 00:18:23,880
Way too long.

532
00:18:24,440 --> 00:18:26,150
They didn't notice though.

533
00:18:25,180 --> 00:18:29,420
What's your occupation?

534
00:18:26,550 --> 00:18:30,150
What did you ask him?
- I asked him about his occupation.

535
00:18:26,650 --> 00:18:27,750
They seem clueless.

536
00:18:28,250 --> 00:18:29,350
Get outta the frame, Tanaka!

537
00:18:31,250 --> 00:18:32,050
I'm still going strong.

538
00:18:32,350 --> 00:18:33,450
That's a long one.

539
00:18:37,260 --> 00:18:38,860
W-what do I do?

540
00:18:39,090 --> 00:18:41,530
What's my occupation?

541
00:18:41,990 --> 00:18:45,000
Endo

542
00:18:44,060 --> 00:18:45,570
I don't think that counts.

543
00:18:45,070 --> 00:18:46,470
You're a comedian.

544
00:18:46,670 --> 00:18:47,570
What about...

545
00:18:47,970 --> 00:18:52,140
when you first came to Japan,

546
00:18:52,140 --> 00:18:55,510
did you have a boyfriend back home?

547
00:18:55,510 --> 00:18:58,950
Yes, I had a boyfriend before I left China.

548
00:18:58,950 --> 00:19:00,980
But we broke up once I moved here.

549
00:18:59,310 --> 00:19:22,670
Tanaka

550
00:19:00,980 --> 00:19:06,150
I started dating another man
but we're no longer together,

551
00:19:02,150 --> 00:19:04,320
Does that count?

552
00:19:04,320 --> 00:19:06,120
Oh, it's Tanaka's turn.

553
00:19:06,150 --> 00:19:09,230
But we're no longer together.
And that's where i'm at right now.

554
00:19:07,950 --> 00:19:09,230
So you're single.

555
00:19:09,060 --> 00:19:14,830
Were you dating a Japanese guy?

556
00:19:12,090 --> 00:19:16,170
No, he was also an exchange student.

557
00:19:14,660 --> 00:19:16,740
He was also from China then?

558
00:19:15,560 --> 00:19:17,640
Why are you Bikkuri at Endo?

559
00:19:16,560 --> 00:19:18,670
From Shanghai?

560
00:19:17,030 --> 00:19:18,430
No, further north.

561
00:19:18,430 --> 00:19:21,170
From Peking?

562
00:19:19,200 --> 00:19:21,170
Yes, from Peking.

563
00:19:21,170 --> 00:19:22,670
Anything wrong?

564
00:19:21,670 --> 00:19:23,740
She must be like, "what a weirdo".

565
00:19:22,840 --> 00:19:24,940
What a nice story.

566
00:19:23,740 --> 00:19:25,180
I think she knows what's up.

567
00:19:24,370 --> 00:19:26,240
Isn't it?

568
00:19:24,970 --> 00:19:26,240
No, seriously.

569
00:19:25,370 --> 00:19:26,450
Yea, she knows.

570
00:19:27,370 --> 00:19:30,050
It's been an hour.

571
00:19:31,080 --> 00:19:34,450
After successfully displaying numerous Bikkuri faces,

572
00:19:34,450 --> 00:19:37,820
they aim for the big finish.

573
00:19:38,050 --> 00:19:41,650
Your show "Golden Legend" is very popular in Taiwan right now.

574
00:19:42,560 --> 00:19:44,190
Tanaka

575
00:19:45,460 --> 00:19:49,600
The show "London Hearts"
is also playing in Taiwan.

576
00:19:49,600 --> 00:19:53,370
If Atsushi showed up with his
band "Jealkb" in Taiwan,

577
00:19:53,370 --> 00:19:57,040
and he stepped out in public with no disguise,

578
00:19:57,040 --> 00:19:59,840
He would totally get recognized.

579
00:20:01,050 --> 00:20:03,450
100% sure you've been exposed.

580
00:20:03,550 --> 00:20:04,850
No, they didn't know.

581
00:20:04,610 --> 00:20:06,110
Tanaka

582
00:20:06,110 --> 00:20:10,750
Hiraiwa

583
00:20:06,450 --> 00:20:07,250
But this ain't normal.

584
00:20:07,250 --> 00:20:08,720
Seriously, no idea.

585
00:20:08,580 --> 00:20:10,750
That's what I heard.

586
00:20:08,720 --> 00:20:09,620
They didn't know.

587
00:20:09,620 --> 00:20:10,820
This isn't right.

588
00:20:11,650 --> 00:20:15,390
Excuse me.

589
00:20:15,390 --> 00:20:17,690
Can I ask what this is?

590
00:20:17,690 --> 00:20:22,360
We're submerging prawns in the
Shaoxing Wine to get them drunk.

591
00:20:20,630 --> 00:20:21,630
- Let's check it out.

592
00:20:26,900 --> 00:20:29,740
splash

593
00:20:27,070 --> 00:20:29,740
splash

594
00:20:34,450 --> 00:20:35,450
Honestly, this is...

595
00:20:39,450 --> 00:20:41,650
This is a high "Shit your pants" percentage

596
00:20:42,050 --> 00:20:43,220
Scary...

597
00:20:43,320 --> 00:20:44,220
Aren't you guys scared?

598
00:20:44,220 --> 00:20:46,120
That was uncalled for.

599
00:20:46,120 --> 00:20:49,060
They serve this in Shanghai too.

600
00:20:48,120 --> 00:20:49,820
- Oh, is that right?!

601
00:20:50,460 --> 00:20:54,790
May I have the check please?

602
00:20:57,840 --> 00:20:59,640
It's interesting...

603
00:21:01,070 --> 00:21:05,840
WHAT??!!

604
00:21:02,240 --> 00:21:05,840
That's a huge bill!!

605
00:21:05,840 --> 00:21:07,150
The poor server had to hear that?!

606
00:21:06,140 --> 00:21:11,480
Over

607
00:21:06,140 --> 00:21:11,480
The King of Bikkuri Face

608
00:21:10,450 --> 00:21:11,480
Please, let me get that.

609
00:21:11,650 --> 00:21:13,210
You don't think they found out?

610
00:21:13,550 --> 00:21:15,150
I believe we barely made it through.

611
00:21:15,150 --> 00:21:16,220
I bet she didn't feel

612
00:21:16,220 --> 00:21:20,690
it was appropriate to call you out,
let alone in her second language.

613
00:21:20,690 --> 00:21:22,490
I'm afraid you have a point.

614
00:21:22,490 --> 00:21:23,590
So here's their score.

615
00:21:23,560 --> 00:21:24,290
Let's see it.

616
00:21:24,290 --> 00:21:25,690
Here it is.

617
00:21:25,690 --> 00:21:28,190
I'm pretty certain that

618
00:21:28,190 --> 00:21:30,600
the show was exposed.

619
00:21:30,900 --> 00:21:32,600
They must've been very suspicious of you two.

620
00:21:31,800 --> 00:21:33,000
I have to agree.

621
00:21:33,000 --> 00:21:34,100
I see.

622
00:21:34,500 --> 00:21:35,300
When we told them the truth later,

623
00:21:35,500 --> 00:21:37,400
that male coordinator,

624
00:21:38,900 --> 00:21:40,210
started crying.

625
00:21:40,210 --> 00:21:41,410
Tears and everything.

626
00:21:41,610 --> 00:21:44,010
He's a passionate guy and he had been thinking

627
00:21:44,010 --> 00:21:45,210
"I have to do a better job..."

628
00:21:45,310 --> 00:21:47,910
And that Bikkuri'ed (surprised) us the most.

629
00:21:49,880 --> 00:21:50,780
Next week.

630
00:21:53,650 --> 00:21:56,260
Well will continue the King of Bikkure Face Challenge.

631
00:21:57,360 --> 00:21:59,960
Newcomer, Tsukaji, is in big trouble!

632
00:22:00,360 --> 00:22:01,830
I'm getting lots of TV gigs though...

633
00:22:01,900 --> 00:22:05,100
Do it!

634
00:22:05,800 --> 00:22:07,600
The "Surprise" attack of Gekidan Hitori.

635
00:22:13,610 --> 00:22:14,940
Don't miss it.

636
00:22:15,010 --> 00:22:17,510
To those whom we've inconvenienced

637
00:22:21,010 --> 00:22:24,520
What's this?

638
00:22:24,520 --> 00:22:25,790
I'm really sorry.

639
00:22:27,130 --> 00:22:29,930
But you have been setup.

640
00:22:30,330 --> 00:22:33,130
You've been taped the whole time.

641
00:22:31,590 --> 00:22:34,560
Is that why you paid for this?

642
00:22:33,430 --> 00:22:34,590
W-Well, I suppose...

643
00:22:42,870 --> 00:22:46,470
Well, I'm going to do better...

644
00:22:47,270 --> 00:22:49,380
Why are you crying?

645
00:22:49,380 --> 00:22:50,910
Really, why're you crying?

646
00:22:51,010 --> 00:22:52,310
I appreciate your passion...

647
00:22:52,310 --> 00:22:53,910
You made us realize,

648
00:22:53,910 --> 00:22:55,220
how much you care about your work,

649
00:22:55,220 --> 00:22:56,620
Thank you.

650
00:22:57,220 --> 00:22:59,920
But I don't know how to react to your tears.

651
00:23:00,120 --> 00:23:02,290
Looking forward to working with you.

652
00:23:02,890 --> 00:23:04,090
Thank you.

653
00:23:03,690 --> 00:23:04,690
Excuse us.

654
00:23:05,730 --> 00:23:06,830
Good job, guys.

655
00:23:12,840 --> 00:23:14,640
What a surprise.

656
00:23:17,340 --> 00:23:19,140
What?

657
00:23:19,440 --> 00:23:23,050
Can we see tour Bikkuri face please?

658
00:23:32,060 --> 00:23:32,660
Thank you very much.

659
00:23:32,660 --> 00:23:34,360
What the hell?!
