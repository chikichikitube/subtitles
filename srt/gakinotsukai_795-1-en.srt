1
00:00:02,960 --> 00:00:07,580
For the past two weeks we've been holding the Hamada "Unthinkable" Trials!

2
00:00:07,580 --> 00:00:12,000
Numerous shocking details had come to light over the course of trial,

3
00:00:12,000 --> 00:00:14,280
with the first being....

4
00:00:17,140 --> 00:00:19,340
That he is super sadistic!

5
00:00:19,880 --> 00:00:23,240
In response to Wakky's boasts of having hard abs....

6
00:00:26,040 --> 00:00:29,540
And to the director, Onuma who dressed up as a Red Panda....

7
00:00:32,900 --> 00:00:35,600
...he was definitely sadistic.

8
00:00:36,280 --> 00:00:39,360
Furthermore, gender is irrelevant with Hamada's targets.

9
00:00:39,360 --> 00:00:42,440
This is how he treated Murakami from Morisanchu....

10
00:00:48,280 --> 00:00:50,740
He does whatever he pleases.

11
00:00:50,740 --> 00:00:53,580
In response to that, Hamada himself claims...

12
00:00:53,580 --> 00:00:56,440
It's tsukkomi.

13
00:00:54,620 --> 00:00:56,440
Tsukkomi!?

14
00:00:56,440 --> 00:00:59,520
Rather than using words or simply hitting...

15
00:00:59,520 --> 00:01:02,200
...squeezing them for her was the tsukkomi.

16
00:01:02,320 --> 00:01:05,680
Not even a shade of remorse.

17
00:01:05,680 --> 00:01:07,680
And that's not all!

18
00:01:13,020 --> 00:01:16,200
He farts without embarrassment in front of other people.

19
00:01:20,760 --> 00:01:23,480
And after that, without fail he...

20
00:01:23,480 --> 00:01:25,660
WAHAHAHAHA

21
00:01:26,880 --> 00:01:28,620
...cackles out loud.

22
00:01:28,620 --> 00:01:31,940
This lack of delicacy is just unthinkable!

23
00:01:32,880 --> 00:01:36,180
What was the punishment handed down to Hamada for his crimes!?

24
00:01:36,180 --> 00:01:39,200
As you have observed, Hamada not only excessively obstructs

25
00:01:39,200 --> 00:01:43,040
our jokes, but also those of young comedians.

26
00:01:43,040 --> 00:01:47,360
The extent to which he harasses others has exceeded our expectations.

27
00:01:47,360 --> 00:01:50,680
Consequently, he shall not be excused, and shall receive

28
00:01:50,720 --> 00:01:54,780
the "Sing the Kaeru no Uta song with retches" punishment!

29
00:01:54,780 --> 00:01:57,700
What in the world is that?

30
00:01:57,700 --> 00:02:01,000
I don't wanna do whatever that is.

31
00:02:01,000 --> 00:02:04,340
WHAT ARE YOU SAYING?

32
00:02:05,480 --> 00:02:09,320
Tonight, Hamada will be served with DIVINE PUNISHMENT.

33
00:02:21,440 --> 00:02:28,200
Hamada Masatoshi's Unthinkable Trial

34
00:02:21,440 --> 00:02:28,200
SING KAERU NO UTA WITH RETCHES PUNISHMENT

35
00:02:26,460 --> 00:02:28,200
Enforcement!

36
00:02:28,260 --> 00:02:32,440
Having received a guilty charge, Hamada was strapped to a seat.

37
00:02:32,800 --> 00:02:38,020
Now, Matsumoto and co. will record retches of all musical scales.

38
00:02:39,060 --> 00:02:44,340
What method will they use to completely stomp on sadistic Hamada's pride?

39
00:02:44,340 --> 00:02:47,820
We'll insert twisted paper into his nose holes.

40
00:02:47,820 --> 00:02:52,380
Normally people would sneeze, but since he's an idiot he retches instead.

41
00:02:52,440 --> 00:02:54,420
So do you!

42
00:02:54,420 --> 00:03:01,260
And we'll keep doing it until he retches out all musical scales.

43
00:03:01,260 --> 00:03:04,260
Many kinds of retches then?

44
00:03:02,300 --> 00:03:05,620
We'd like to hear many different retches.

45
00:03:03,460 --> 00:03:06,460
You guys must be stupid.

46
00:03:05,620 --> 00:03:07,800
Ok everyone, let's do this!

47
00:03:06,880 --> 00:03:10,080
What the heck is that?

48
00:03:09,180 --> 00:03:12,180
It's a "she", not a "that".

49
00:03:12,180 --> 00:03:16,360
This is a lady who can sense perfect pitch.

50
00:03:16,360 --> 00:03:20,460
She'll judge what musical note your retches are.

51
00:03:20,460 --> 00:03:23,260
But what the hell are you gonna do with the recording?

52
00:03:23,260 --> 00:03:26,120
Whaaat are you saying?

53
00:03:26,960 --> 00:03:29,760
PUNISHMENT COMMENCES!!

54
00:03:30,620 --> 00:03:33,220
I'll start first then.

55
00:03:34,060 --> 00:03:35,460
Don't move!

56
00:03:42,640 --> 00:03:44,760
What was that?

57
00:03:44,240 --> 00:03:46,340
That was a LA.

58
00:03:44,760 --> 00:03:46,760
We got a LA!

59
00:03:46,760 --> 00:03:49,540
I want to get a MI, if possible.

60
00:03:50,420 --> 00:03:53,120
Let's all try and get notes we choose.

61
00:03:54,240 --> 00:03:56,040
C'mon MI! C'mon MI!

62
00:03:57,300 --> 00:03:59,300
Same as before.

63
00:03:58,180 --> 00:04:01,300
Another friggin' LA!

64
00:04:01,300 --> 00:04:03,300
Don't make a LA sound.

65
00:04:03,300 --> 00:04:06,560
DO NOT DO A LA!

66
00:04:07,100 --> 00:04:10,660
Who could possibly choose what comes out?

67
00:04:12,660 --> 00:04:15,200
Same one.

68
00:04:13,900 --> 00:04:17,140
LA again!?

69
00:04:16,260 --> 00:04:18,660
They've all been LA.

70
00:04:18,660 --> 00:04:21,720
DON'T DO A LA!

71
00:04:21,720 --> 00:04:24,940
I don't know what's a LA, and what's not!

72
00:04:24,940 --> 00:04:28,100
Do anything but a LA.

73
00:04:34,080 --> 00:04:36,700
We got a SO.

74
00:04:34,800 --> 00:04:37,440
Oh yeah, a SO!

75
00:04:37,440 --> 00:04:39,440
Stop moving.

76
00:04:40,500 --> 00:04:42,380
The heck was that?

77
00:04:43,060 --> 00:04:45,400
You went "Oooheee!""

78
00:04:47,620 --> 00:04:49,620
The heck was that?

79
00:04:50,620 --> 00:04:53,620
Don't shove it up there so much.

80
00:04:54,580 --> 00:04:57,320
What do you mean?

81
00:04:55,820 --> 00:04:57,320
Not so quick...

82
00:05:09,100 --> 00:05:11,100
That was a MI.

83
00:05:10,560 --> 00:05:13,100
Alright, we got a MI!

84
00:05:13,500 --> 00:05:16,900
Also, can't you make a louder noise?

85
00:05:16,900 --> 00:05:18,900
Maybe try a thicker bit of paper?

86
00:05:18,020 --> 00:05:20,900
Oh I see, and get a low tone?

87
00:05:22,900 --> 00:05:25,400
That was a DO.

88
00:05:25,400 --> 00:05:27,660
Let me wipe my tears.

89
00:05:27,660 --> 00:05:30,820
Ow ow! The hell? It won't go in like that! Ow!

90
00:05:30,820 --> 00:05:32,820
I'm saying it hurts.

91
00:05:32,040 --> 00:05:34,820
It didn't make you retch.

92
00:05:34,820 --> 00:05:37,500
Well it wasn't even in my nose!

93
00:05:37,500 --> 00:05:40,240
At least put it in first!

94
00:05:42,260 --> 00:05:44,180
Your face is soaked.

95
00:05:43,560 --> 00:05:46,600
Why doesn't the sounds come out?

96
00:05:46,160 --> 00:05:48,300
We still need these sounds.

97
00:05:47,300 --> 00:05:50,620
Oh, can you play it again?

98
00:05:49,980 --> 00:05:52,980
We need RE, FA and SI.

99
00:05:52,980 --> 00:05:54,400
In addition....

100
00:05:53,500 --> 00:05:55,420
Well you come and try doing it then.

101
00:05:54,400 --> 00:05:57,420
Don't address her so rudely.

102
00:06:07,220 --> 00:06:10,100
It was the higher DO.

103
00:06:10,100 --> 00:06:12,760
Yay, we go the high DO.

104
00:06:13,800 --> 00:06:16,300
I can't take any more...

105
00:06:16,300 --> 00:06:18,780
No more, I'm telling you.

106
00:06:26,780 --> 00:06:28,780
It was LA.

107
00:06:28,140 --> 00:06:30,380
Yeah, he even said LA.

108
00:06:30,380 --> 00:06:33,600
We need RE, FA and TI.

109
00:06:31,260 --> 00:06:34,160
Yes, three more.

110
00:06:33,600 --> 00:06:36,560
We don't have time to spend so long on this.

111
00:06:38,560 --> 00:06:41,320
It's touching my eye.

112
00:06:45,020 --> 00:06:47,140
We have a RE.

113
00:06:47,140 --> 00:06:48,260
Hell yeah!

114
00:06:47,860 --> 00:06:53,540
Stop making lame noises after you retch.

115
00:07:02,620 --> 00:07:04,620
Did we get it?

116
00:07:03,580 --> 00:07:06,620
It was a RE, like before.

117
00:07:05,180 --> 00:07:06,620
A RE, huh?

118
00:07:07,160 --> 00:07:10,680
I have to make an "AHHH!" sound?

119
00:07:09,420 --> 00:07:10,680
Yes.

120
00:07:11,360 --> 00:07:16,080
With only two sounds left, Hamada's progress stalled.

121
00:07:17,060 --> 00:07:21,580
Unsurprisingly a sadistic person like Hamada is bad at handling attacks.

122
00:07:22,960 --> 00:07:25,640
Stop making a painful face!

123
00:07:25,640 --> 00:07:27,640
Huh, why?

124
00:07:27,640 --> 00:07:30,120
Do it with a smile!

125
00:07:29,100 --> 00:07:31,220
That's right.

126
00:07:30,120 --> 00:07:33,460
It's as though we're bullying him.

127
00:07:31,860 --> 00:07:33,460
Makes us look bad.

128
00:07:34,160 --> 00:07:37,700
And like this, 15 minutes passed.

129
00:07:37,900 --> 00:07:40,500
He really doesn't sneeze.

130
00:07:46,120 --> 00:07:48,760
That was LA.

131
00:07:47,420 --> 00:07:50,760
Really? Sounds like we're getting closer though.

132
00:07:50,760 --> 00:07:53,400
LA, huh?

133
00:08:02,940 --> 00:08:05,920
I think that can be a TI.

134
00:08:06,280 --> 00:08:08,940
You just need a FA now, Hamada-san!

135
00:08:08,940 --> 00:08:11,620
FA is difficult though!

136
00:08:11,620 --> 00:08:14,260
I can't do it!

137
00:08:16,960 --> 00:08:19,740
I wouldn't have a clue.

138
00:08:44,080 --> 00:08:47,160
The tone lowered and became FA at the end.

139
00:08:47,160 --> 00:08:49,160
Let's just use that bit.

140
00:08:49,160 --> 00:08:52,540
We may be unable to use it, so please try again.

141
00:08:55,160 --> 00:08:58,500
Maaan.... it hurts!

142
00:08:59,280 --> 00:09:01,540
You're sticking it up too far Matsumoto.

143
00:09:01,060 --> 00:09:02,960
What's wrong?

144
00:09:01,540 --> 00:09:02,780
You're sticking it too...

145
00:09:07,060 --> 00:09:09,780
Only coughs are coming out.

146
00:09:09,780 --> 00:09:12,120
That's not funny.

147
00:09:13,160 --> 00:09:18,040
I'll only cough if you leave it shoved up. Drag it in and out!

148
00:09:24,720 --> 00:09:27,480
Here I am, trying my utmost hardest.

149
00:09:27,480 --> 00:09:31,080
Yet, right in front of me Koba was yawning.

150
00:09:31,980 --> 00:09:35,100
Kobayashi Hiromichi

151
00:09:31,980 --> 00:09:35,100
Producer

152
00:09:33,080 --> 00:09:35,380
What's the meaning of this?

153
00:09:35,380 --> 00:09:39,340
Is it okay for a producer to yawn right in front of my eyes?

154
00:09:39,340 --> 00:09:41,940
He was the judge.

155
00:09:41,940 --> 00:09:44,800
He was completely nervous before as judge.

156
00:09:46,800 --> 00:09:48,920
What are you doing...?

157
00:09:48,920 --> 00:09:51,920
We should poke his ear a bit too.

158
00:09:51,920 --> 00:09:54,200
What are you doing!?

159
00:09:54,200 --> 00:09:57,180
Change his tuning like that.

160
00:10:00,020 --> 00:10:02,520
Remember it's a FA.

161
00:10:04,520 --> 00:10:06,780
It has to be even lower.

162
00:10:05,840 --> 00:10:08,180
I'm gonna puke, you know.

163
00:10:08,180 --> 00:10:10,700
Puke away then.

164
00:10:08,960 --> 00:10:10,700
Jeez.

165
00:10:10,700 --> 00:10:13,740
You only have a FA left to do!

166
00:10:13,460 --> 00:10:15,400
Hurry up and do a FA!

167
00:10:15,400 --> 00:10:17,740
HURRY UP AND DO A FA!

168
00:10:19,740 --> 00:10:22,880
Ahhh man, this is crazy.

169
00:10:38,940 --> 00:10:41,500
IT'S NOT WOOOORKING!

170
00:10:41,500 --> 00:10:44,320
It's not working.....

171
00:10:44,320 --> 00:10:46,800
Hey man, open your mouth.

172
00:10:47,220 --> 00:10:49,620
Ohhh not my mouth!

173
00:10:51,620 --> 00:10:54,320
It was too high.

174
00:10:53,440 --> 00:10:56,920
Too high? But it's still a good method!

175
00:10:59,200 --> 00:11:02,100
Too low.

176
00:11:02,400 --> 00:11:05,040
No! Not the mouth!

177
00:11:10,300 --> 00:11:12,540
Too low.

178
00:11:12,100 --> 00:11:14,840
Low? We're getting close though.

179
00:11:14,840 --> 00:11:16,840
Not the mouth!

180
00:11:17,340 --> 00:11:20,300
No! Use the nose. Nose!

181
00:11:23,360 --> 00:11:26,000
We've got it.

182
00:11:24,360 --> 00:11:28,000
YEAAHHH!

183
00:11:28,880 --> 00:11:30,880
OK!

184
00:11:29,760 --> 00:11:32,160
We got it!

185
00:11:32,160 --> 00:11:36,980
So we'll now edit this and arrange it into Kaeru no Uta.

186
00:11:36,980 --> 00:11:38,980
They can do that?

187
00:11:37,800 --> 00:11:39,460
Yes!

188
00:11:39,920 --> 00:11:44,180
After this is the world's most realistic frog's chorus by Hamada!

189
00:11:44,180 --> 00:11:46,180
Don't miss it!

190
00:11:46,400 --> 00:11:50,960
So we've been doing this "Sing Kaeru no Uta with retches" punishment,

191
00:11:51,260 --> 00:11:54,300
and we'd like everyone to watch it today.

192
00:11:55,260 --> 00:11:58,060
The staff had some negative comments regarding this.

193
00:11:58,060 --> 00:12:01,240
They told us just then, right in front of us.

194
00:12:01,240 --> 00:12:04,440
It's not a very pleasant video, they said.

195
00:12:04,440 --> 00:12:07,160
Stuff you! You're the one that made me do it!

196
00:12:07,160 --> 00:12:11,340
If it was Tamaki Hiroshi, it should've made for a more pleasant viewing.

197
00:12:11,340 --> 00:12:13,340
Well, he is a good looker I guess.

198
00:12:12,200 --> 00:12:15,960
Something innate to Hamada is causing people to feel sickened.

199
00:12:15,200 --> 00:12:18,100
It'd be the same for anybody.

200
00:12:18,100 --> 00:12:20,860
Well...let's just take a look, shall we?

201
00:12:20,860 --> 00:12:22,860
Yes, let's watch.

202
00:12:21,400 --> 00:12:23,640
So, here's the video. Enjoy.

203
00:12:24,660 --> 00:12:31,640
CHORUS OF THE FROGS

204
00:12:24,660 --> 00:12:31,640
Children

205
00:12:24,660 --> 00:12:31,640
Hamada Masatoshi

206
00:12:25,400 --> 00:12:29,140
Now, please listen to Hamada's cry from his soul in his

207
00:12:29,140 --> 00:12:32,200
rendition of the "Chorus of the Frogs"

208
00:12:32,900 --> 00:12:37,920
Friends from RICO MUSIC ACADEMY

209
00:12:38,900 --> 00:12:44,640
The song of the frogs

210
00:12:44,640 --> 00:12:50,700
(The song of the frogs)

211
00:12:44,640 --> 00:12:50,700
can be heard.

212
00:12:50,700 --> 00:12:56,800
(can be heard.)

213
00:12:50,700 --> 00:12:56,800
Kwa-Kwa-Kwa-Kwa

214
00:12:56,800 --> 00:13:02,920
(Kwa-Kwa-Kwa-Kwa)

215
00:12:56,800 --> 00:13:02,920
Kero-Kero-Kero-Kero, Kwa-Kwa-Kwa

216
00:13:02,920 --> 00:13:08,380
(Kero-Kero-Kero-Kero, Kwa-Kwa-Kwa)

217
00:13:41,320 --> 00:13:43,640
What the heck was that!?

218
00:13:44,260 --> 00:13:46,960
What the heck!?

219
00:13:46,960 --> 00:13:49,520
That was surprisingly well done!

220
00:13:51,240 --> 00:13:53,240
It's made quite well!

221
00:13:53,240 --> 00:13:57,400
You'd start to feel sick repeatedly watching that while editing.

222
00:13:56,420 --> 00:13:58,120
For sure.

223
00:13:58,120 --> 00:14:02,440
A modern way of saying it is fugly fun.

224
00:14:02,440 --> 00:14:03,680
It was fugly fun.

225
00:14:03,740 --> 00:14:06,400
There's one where you go "Waaaghhh!"

226
00:14:06,400 --> 00:14:09,680
Yeah, like a cry from the soul.

227
00:14:09,680 --> 00:14:13,320
It wasn't too bad if it's only as long as that.

228
00:14:13,320 --> 00:14:17,440
Since we were able to get such great retches

229
00:14:17,440 --> 00:14:21,400
we made another song, that's not the Kaeru no Uta.

230
00:14:21,400 --> 00:14:23,400
Serious?

231
00:14:21,980 --> 00:14:25,000
Thought it may be a good idea.

232
00:14:25,000 --> 00:14:27,000
Please have a look.

233
00:14:27,540 --> 00:14:32,780
Children

234
00:14:27,540 --> 00:14:32,780
DO-RE-MI

235
00:14:27,540 --> 00:14:32,780
Hamada Masatoshi

236
00:14:39,500 --> 00:14:47,680
Doe a deer, a female deer, Ray a drop of golden sun.

237
00:14:41,460 --> 00:14:53,780
*BTW, the Japanese lyrics are very different. I'm just using the Eng version.

238
00:14:47,680 --> 00:14:55,100
Me, a name I call myself, Far, a longer way to run

239
00:14:55,440 --> 00:15:03,720
Sew, a needle pulling thread, La, a note to follow Sew

240
00:15:03,720 --> 00:15:11,780
Tea, I drink with jam and bread, That will bring us back to DO.

241
00:15:11,780 --> 00:15:15,720
Doe a deer a female deer

242
00:15:15,720 --> 00:15:19,760
Ray, a drop of golden sun

243
00:15:19,760 --> 00:15:23,640
Me, a name I call myself

244
00:15:23,640 --> 00:15:27,440
Far, a longer way to run

245
00:15:27,440 --> 00:15:31,680
Sew, a needle pulling thread

246
00:15:31,680 --> 00:15:34,900
La, a note to follow sew

247
00:15:35,080 --> 00:15:39,300
Tea, I drink with jam and bread

248
00:15:39,300 --> 00:15:42,840
That will bring us back to Do.

249
00:16:24,020 --> 00:16:26,020
Woah....

250
00:16:26,500 --> 00:16:30,660
Yeah, that actually was a bit sickening.

251
00:16:30,660 --> 00:16:33,180
The previous one was fugly fun but

252
00:16:33,180 --> 00:16:35,980
this one was fugly gross.

253
00:16:39,240 --> 00:16:43,780
This is a question for Matsumoto, who is said to be able to create a sound effect for anything.

254
00:16:43,780 --> 00:16:48,720
What would Hamada's tsukkomi be if you made it into a sound effect.

255
00:16:48,720 --> 00:16:52,160
For example, how does a dog bark?

256
00:16:52,160 --> 00:16:54,160
Woof.

257
00:16:52,640 --> 00:16:56,020
Oh my god! Dogs just can't stand that answer.

258
00:16:56,020 --> 00:16:58,840
You'd be pissed if you saw an impersonation of you on TV

259
00:16:58,840 --> 00:17:00,980
that looks nothing like you right?

260
00:17:01,000 --> 00:17:04,000
And if he ain't funny, it's like you ain't funny yourself.

261
00:17:04,000 --> 00:17:08,120
Dogs are equally pissed off in regards to the perception that they woof.

262
00:17:08,140 --> 00:17:11,540
They go "Grrrrr!" when they hear that. That noise is the same.

263
00:17:11,080 --> 00:17:13,280
They go grrr?

264
00:17:11,540 --> 00:17:13,280
They actually do go "Grrr".

265
00:17:13,280 --> 00:17:17,380
It's the same with tigers and lions. What's a lion's noise?

266
00:17:17,380 --> 00:17:20,040
"Rooooaarrr!"

267
00:17:20,040 --> 00:17:22,280
That's Oka Hachiro!

268
00:17:21,620 --> 00:17:26,800
Oka Hachiro is a comedian mainly associated with Yoshimoto Shinkigeki. Not sure what relation is, but probably has a gag to do with roaring.

269
00:17:22,280 --> 00:17:25,240
That's "Gaoo!". The audience won't even know.

270
00:17:25,460 --> 00:17:29,380
It's because you've never heard a lions roar up close before.

271
00:17:29,380 --> 00:17:32,100
"TAAAA!", that's it.

272
00:17:32,100 --> 00:17:34,520
I am not joking.

273
00:17:34,520 --> 00:17:36,960
TAAAA!

274
00:17:36,960 --> 00:17:39,300
"Hey you there TAAAA!"

275
00:17:39,300 --> 00:17:42,540
The "Taa" is fine, but what's with the "Hey you"?

276
00:17:42,540 --> 00:17:46,060
Supposing that they could talk.

277
00:17:44,800 --> 00:17:46,820
Okay then.

278
00:17:46,820 --> 00:17:51,160
Well whatever. So what does a dog say?

279
00:17:51,500 --> 00:17:53,880
It's hard to just pinpoint a dog specifically.

280
00:17:53,880 --> 00:17:58,360
But you just specified that lions go "TAAAA!".

281
00:17:58,360 --> 00:18:00,840
Well, we need to hear more than just that one phrase.

282
00:18:00,840 --> 00:18:04,400
I'll start from even before they say it.

283
00:18:02,740 --> 00:18:05,560
What do you mean?

284
00:18:04,400 --> 00:18:06,700
I'll start from when they go for a stroll.

285
00:18:05,560 --> 00:18:07,460
Wait, what?

286
00:18:06,700 --> 00:18:09,320
I'll start from going for a stroll.

287
00:18:07,820 --> 00:18:10,180
Okay then....

288
00:18:09,320 --> 00:18:13,920
So, you're walking along a corridor like squish squish squish

289
00:18:13,920 --> 00:18:15,920
What's the squishing about?

290
00:18:15,920 --> 00:18:21,180
Well, if you listen really carefully, footsteps actually sound like....

291
00:18:21,180 --> 00:18:23,900
squish.

292
00:18:24,620 --> 00:18:27,720
Oh, that's what you mean. Right, since you make sound effects for everything.

293
00:18:27,720 --> 00:18:30,240
Please continue.

294
00:18:28,220 --> 00:18:31,900
Oh, you're fine with that explanation? You sure about that?

295
00:18:31,900 --> 00:18:34,260
I'm definitely getting the dog noise from you.

296
00:18:34,260 --> 00:18:36,820
How do you want me to do it?

297
00:18:36,820 --> 00:18:38,700
The dog's....

298
00:18:37,080 --> 00:18:39,740
Do I need to make it funny?

299
00:18:39,740 --> 00:18:43,180
Everyone is eagerly waiting now, because it's not woof.

300
00:18:43,600 --> 00:18:46,300
At this stage, it's hard for me to say something funny.

301
00:18:46,300 --> 00:18:48,300
Yes of course. I know that.

302
00:18:47,720 --> 00:18:50,760
It's basically impossible to pull this off now.

303
00:18:50,760 --> 00:18:53,880
And yet, will you still make me do this?

304
00:18:53,880 --> 00:18:57,580
You've got to tell us the sound effect!

305
00:18:57,000 --> 00:18:59,840
Okay fine, I'll do it. Of what though?

306
00:18:59,840 --> 00:19:02,420
What about cats? They go "Meow", right?

307
00:19:02,420 --> 00:19:05,020
Yes, cats go "Meow".

308
00:19:05,020 --> 00:19:07,880
Well dogs sound like "Woof" to me.

309
00:19:06,340 --> 00:19:08,620
Yes, you're right.

310
00:19:08,900 --> 00:19:10,840
What?

311
00:19:09,260 --> 00:19:11,020
I think so too.

312
00:19:11,100 --> 00:19:13,100
Wait, what?

313
00:19:11,240 --> 00:19:13,320
I think so too.

314
00:19:14,160 --> 00:19:16,700
Do dogs go "Woof"?

315
00:19:15,000 --> 00:19:17,060
They do say woof.

316
00:19:17,060 --> 00:19:19,060
It's not woof, right?

317
00:19:17,520 --> 00:19:21,060
It's woof. They totally say "Woof".

318
00:19:21,060 --> 00:19:24,360
Big or small, they all say "Woof".

319
00:19:24,360 --> 00:19:26,920
"Grrrr, woof!", that's totally what they say.

320
00:19:26,920 --> 00:19:29,460
What's your problem then?

321
00:19:28,000 --> 00:19:30,400
What?

322
00:19:29,460 --> 00:19:31,460
They're all exactly as they sound then!

323
00:19:31,460 --> 00:19:34,420
Is that some sort of problem?

324
00:19:34,420 --> 00:19:37,140
Well you're the one that objected before!

325
00:19:36,240 --> 00:19:39,140
But I didn't object.....

326
00:19:39,140 --> 00:19:41,140
You said dogs don't woof.

327
00:19:39,740 --> 00:19:43,140
I'm just being made to do this.

328
00:19:44,100 --> 00:19:47,720
You're the one that originally said that dogs don't woof.

329
00:19:47,720 --> 00:19:51,780
But hey, don't you think.....that's your fault?

330
00:19:52,340 --> 00:19:54,280
Why?

331
00:19:53,320 --> 00:19:56,740
Aren't you just making me say these things?

332
00:19:56,740 --> 00:20:01,860
I...I just wanted to have a normal conversation.

333
00:19:57,260 --> 00:19:59,720
I don't understand.

334
00:20:02,540 --> 00:20:07,080
You....You're just making me say this stuff.

335
00:20:07,480 --> 00:20:10,580
It's so depressing.

336
00:20:10,580 --> 00:20:13,800
What is he saying? You're the one that started saying

337
00:20:13,800 --> 00:20:17,080
"You know what lions really sound like!?"

338
00:20:17,080 --> 00:20:19,180
They say "TAAAN!".

339
00:20:19,180 --> 00:20:20,940
You said that!

340
00:20:20,940 --> 00:20:23,600
"Hey you there TAAAN!"

341
00:20:27,960 --> 00:20:31,100
But, well, you know......that's

342
00:20:31,100 --> 00:20:33,520
....just stupid, isn't it?

343
00:20:33,520 --> 00:20:37,360
It's just stupid to continue saying this stuff.

344
00:20:38,260 --> 00:20:40,200
Oh, this is kinda funny.

345
00:20:40,200 --> 00:20:44,300
So now you start saying it's stupid.

346
00:20:44,300 --> 00:20:47,380
I didn't start saying anything.

347
00:20:47,380 --> 00:20:50,940
I'm being manipulated by these letters.

348
00:20:51,520 --> 00:20:53,940
Then you should have just denied that

349
00:20:53,940 --> 00:20:56,380
you can make sound effects for anything.

350
00:20:56,380 --> 00:21:00,160
But if I denied it.....you'd smack me again.

351
00:21:00,160 --> 00:21:04,300
I said "Yes, that's right", because I didn't want to be smacked.

352
00:21:05,480 --> 00:21:08,820
You'd have smacked me if I couldn't think of anything too.

353
00:21:08,820 --> 00:21:11,580
It's corporal punishment.

354
00:21:13,580 --> 00:21:16,980
I try hard because I hate being hurt.

355
00:21:16,980 --> 00:21:19,940
But there are times when I can't try any longer....

356
00:21:17,400 --> 00:21:20,380
JUST SHUT UP ALREADY!

357
00:21:21,360 --> 00:21:25,800
I'm trying hard, even with a blocked nose.

358
00:21:25,800 --> 00:21:28,320
Then stop saying useless stuff and get on with it.

359
00:21:28,320 --> 00:21:31,480
But you'll smack me if I don't say useless stuff.

360
00:21:31,480 --> 00:21:33,880
I don't smack you often!

361
00:21:33,480 --> 00:21:36,240
You smack and kick me.

362
00:21:36,240 --> 00:21:38,600
I don't do it that often.

363
00:21:38,600 --> 00:21:42,060
A normal 42 year old shouldn't even be smacked once.

364
00:21:44,860 --> 00:21:48,860
I don't understand the difference between the popular words kimoi and kishoi.

365
00:21:46,880 --> 00:21:54,640
Both mean gross, disgusting, weird sorts of things.

366
00:21:48,860 --> 00:21:53,440
How should I use each word to sound like a young modern Japanese.

367
00:21:53,440 --> 00:21:55,740
This is an important thing.

368
00:21:55,740 --> 00:21:58,800
Yes. For example, you're kimoi.

369
00:21:59,400 --> 00:22:02,700
What? So I'm kimoi, not kishoi?

370
00:22:02,700 --> 00:22:06,320
I'm the kishoi one. WHO YOU CALLIN' KISHOI!?

371
00:22:07,500 --> 00:22:09,680
Freakin' fools.

372
00:22:10,520 --> 00:22:12,520
How do you differentiate...

373
00:22:11,280 --> 00:22:14,520
Want me to turn you into a wax doll!?

374
00:22:12,780 --> 00:22:16,320
Reference to Seikima-II's famous phrase from their song "Rouningyou no Yakata"

375
00:22:16,520 --> 00:22:19,180
How do you use kimoi and kishoi differently?

376
00:22:19,180 --> 00:22:23,920
Generally, kimoi refers to the actual person.

377
00:22:24,460 --> 00:22:27,740
And the way he behaves is kishoi.

378
00:22:27,820 --> 00:22:30,600
So, you're kimoi.

379
00:22:30,600 --> 00:22:34,260
And you picking your nose is kishoi.

380
00:22:32,860 --> 00:22:35,300
This is kishoi?

381
00:22:34,260 --> 00:22:36,940
Kishoi generally applies to verbs...

382
00:22:36,940 --> 00:22:39,500
...and the person is kimoi.

383
00:22:39,500 --> 00:22:42,880
So, you're basically kimoi and

384
00:22:42,880 --> 00:22:46,700
whatever you do is unavoidably kishoi.

385
00:22:47,160 --> 00:22:49,400
WOAH THAT'S SO KISHOI!

386
00:22:49,400 --> 00:22:51,400
That is so kishoi!

387
00:22:51,940 --> 00:22:55,060
Every single step is kishoi!

388
00:22:55,060 --> 00:22:57,620
....because you're kimoi.

389
00:22:57,620 --> 00:23:00,800
Understand? I can't do anything kishoi.

390
00:23:00,800 --> 00:23:03,020
Because I'm not kimoi.

391
00:23:03,020 --> 00:23:05,180
That's just what you think.

392
00:23:05,180 --> 00:23:08,540
You can't become kishoi if you're not already kimoi.

393
00:23:08,540 --> 00:23:10,540
Yeah of course.

394
00:23:09,120 --> 00:23:12,280
Only the chosen few are able.

395
00:23:12,280 --> 00:23:15,100
People that are kishoi, such as yourself.

396
00:23:13,880 --> 00:23:16,340
Shouldn't I be kimoi?

397
00:23:16,140 --> 00:23:18,140
Which one was it again?

398
00:23:17,100 --> 00:23:19,400
I'm kimoi.

399
00:23:19,400 --> 00:23:21,400
If I move I'm kishoi right?

400
00:23:20,820 --> 00:23:23,400
Yes, yes, yes, yes, yes!

401
00:23:23,980 --> 00:23:28,480
So people like you have been stamped with this kimoi mark since birth.

402
00:23:30,000 --> 00:23:34,220
It's not a soft stamp either. It's gonna make a bumps and stuff.

403
00:23:34,220 --> 00:23:37,560
It's the type that stamps on using those bumps.

404
00:23:37,560 --> 00:23:40,200
No idea why I said that twice.

405
00:23:40,900 --> 00:23:42,900
Who gives a crap.
