[Cocorico Channel]

6
00:00:13,820 --> 00:00:14,600
Okay,

7
00:00:14,770 --> 00:00:17,200
let's start today's biology class

8
00:00:16,310 --> 00:00:17,110
Yes, sir.

9
00:00:17,200 --> 00:00:18,910
The theme of today’s class is

10
00:00:20,000 --> 00:00:20,970
Sharks

11
00:00:20,400 --> 00:00:21,200
Ooh, sharks, huh

12
00:00:22,710 --> 00:00:24,910
When it comes to sharks

13
00:00:24,910 --> 00:00:26,450
there are so many amazing things to learn

14
00:00:27,340 --> 00:00:28,250
So guys,

15
00:00:28,420 --> 00:00:30,170
for sharks, worldwide

16
00:00:30,680 --> 00:00:32,940
how many different species do you think there are?

17
00:00:32,700 --> 00:00:34,670
Hmm

18
00:00:33,940 --> 00:00:34,800
The answer:

19
00:00:34,800 --> 00:00:39,920
It's thought that there are over five hundred species world-wide

20
00:00:39,450 --> 00:00:40,800
So you're just gonna tell us.

21
00:00:41,540 --> 00:00:42,550
F-five hundred. Got it.

22
00:00:42,550 --> 00:00:45,800
And, within those over 500 species,

23
00:00:45,800 --> 00:00:47,570
Japan alone

24
00:00:47,710 --> 00:00:49,400
has over a hundred

25
00:00:49,770 --> 00:00:50,600
And,

26
00:00:51,650 --> 00:00:54,910
out of these 500 species

27
00:00:55,450 --> 00:00:59,680
About half - over 250 of these species

28
00:01:00,220 --> 00:01:03,370
are said to live in the deep sea

29
00:01:03,480 --> 00:01:05,170
Oooh, over half huh?

30
00:01:06,170 --> 00:01:07,080
So, the deep sea

31
00:01:07,620 --> 00:01:09,020
Deep sea, specifically...

32
00:01:09,880 --> 00:01:10,770
Guys...

33
00:01:12,250 --> 00:01:12,680
Mm?

34
00:01:12,940 --> 00:01:13,820
'scuse me

35
00:01:14,740 --> 00:01:15,820
Er...

36
00:01:16,140 --> 00:01:18,570
As you all might already know,

37
00:01:18,620 --> 00:01:20,480
"deep sea" refers to areas of water

38
00:01:20,620 --> 00:01:24,510
over uh... 200 uh... meters deep

39
00:01:31,280 --> 00:01:31,770
Hmm?

40
00:01:32,910 --> 00:01:33,420
Hmm?

41
00:01:34,940 --> 00:01:35,540
What's up?

42
00:01:36,140 --> 00:01:36,800
The sea...

43
00:01:38,650 --> 00:01:42,000
Since these areas are so deep...

44
00:01:42,620 --> 00:01:43,710
When you think about it...

45
00:01:45,480 --> 00:01:47,880
the deep sea... the light doesn't...

46
00:01:55,250 --> 00:01:56,400
Hm? What's wrong?

47
00:01:58,310 --> 00:01:59,080
Sensei?

48
00:01:58,740 --> 00:01:59,680
The light doesn't...

49
00:02:00,940 --> 00:02:01,940
because it's so deep...

50
00:02:02,620 --> 00:02:03,200
Sensei?

51
00:02:03,710 --> 00:02:04,650
What’s wrong?

52
00:02:04,420 --> 00:02:06,770
Those sharks... uh....

53
00:02:06,940 --> 00:02:11,600
If you put yourself in their shoes...

54
00:02:13,850 --> 00:02:15,570
Since the light doesn't reach them...

55
00:02:19,620 --> 00:02:21,280
Sensei? What's wrong?

56
00:02:25,680 --> 00:02:26,480
Sensei?

57
00:02:29,740 --> 00:02:30,770
Sorry about that

58
00:02:31,450 --> 00:02:32,020
Huh?

59
00:02:34,220 --> 00:02:35,940
Hahaha…

60
00:02:35,940 --> 00:02:37,570
Huh huh huh?

61
00:02:37,650 --> 00:02:39,570
Sensei, what just happened?

62
00:02:39,880 --> 00:02:40,940
The light just…

63
00:02:40,680 --> 00:02:42,050
what what what what

64
00:02:41,250 --> 00:02:43,620
a life without light...

65
00:02:42,050 --> 00:02:43,080
What was that?

66
00:02:43,800 --> 00:02:44,970
What just happened?

67
00:02:46,200 --> 00:02:48,400
I just feel like it must be so hard to live like that...

68
00:02:48,540 --> 00:02:49,370
Aaah

69
00:02:49,570 --> 00:02:52,310
But… uh…

70
00:02:55,080 --> 00:02:57,340
If you think of it from their perspective...

71
00:02:57,340 --> 00:02:59,020
Yeah, but why are you crying?

72
00:02:59,140 --> 00:03:00,570
Why cry?

73
00:03:00,940 --> 00:03:02,140
Huh huh huh huh?

74
00:03:05,510 --> 00:03:06,280
Sensei?

75
00:03:07,880 --> 00:03:09,740
S-seriously, what's wrong?

76
00:03:12,110 --> 00:03:13,880
He's really going at it…

77
00:03:14,340 --> 00:03:15,080
Why?

78
00:03:17,480 --> 00:03:19,050
Wh-why?

79
00:03:19,710 --> 00:03:21,050
What's wrong?

80
00:03:24,820 --> 00:03:25,800
Sensei

81
00:03:31,600 --> 00:03:32,510
Huh?

82
00:03:33,710 --> 00:03:36,080
What? Whoa whoa whoa whoa....

83
00:03:36,420 --> 00:03:38,220
What what what?

84
00:03:40,200 --> 00:03:41,650
When it's so dark...

85
00:03:41,310 --> 00:03:43,170
What? You’re gonna keep going?

86
00:03:43,940 --> 00:03:45,220
Living in that darkness...

87
00:03:44,910 --> 00:03:46,680
Jesus, this guy...

88
00:03:45,850 --> 00:03:47,740
I guess I'm just thinking

89
00:03:48,250 --> 00:03:49,770
If you look at it from their perspective...

90
00:03:51,600 --> 00:03:53,740
It must be so hard to live like that

91
00:03:53,770 --> 00:03:54,620
Hmm...

92
00:03:55,000 --> 00:03:57,600
Whoa whoa whoa, what happened?

93
00:03:58,050 --> 00:04:00,170
Why all of a sudden

94
00:04:05,400 --> 00:04:08,020
Ever since that deep sea thing

95
00:04:08,020 --> 00:04:11,540
you've just been crying the whole time

96
00:04:11,820 --> 00:04:13,540
You just-

97
00:04:13,710 --> 00:04:15,680
Are you really okay to keep going?

98
00:04:18,050 --> 00:04:19,220
Sorry about that.

99
00:04:20,570 --> 00:04:22,620
So out of these deep sea sharks...

100
00:04:23,000 --> 00:04:24,480
Uh... uh...

101
00:04:24,480 --> 00:04:26,910
Some... stay still...

102
00:04:27,110 --> 00:04:30,250
While some swim around to look for foo-

103
00:04:32,280 --> 00:04:33,850
What what what what?

104
00:04:34,220 --> 00:04:36,080
They just keep swimming...

105
00:04:34,650 --> 00:04:36,220
What was that just now?

106
00:04:36,200 --> 00:04:39,220
looking for food... all the time...

107
00:04:36,850 --> 00:04:38,400
Seriously, what the hell?

108
00:04:40,340 --> 00:04:43,620
What the hell is wrong with this guy?

109
00:04:44,710 --> 00:04:48,080
He can barely keep himself up now, what should we do?

110
00:04:51,880 --> 00:04:54,020
What kind of sudden switch is this?

111
00:04:54,250 --> 00:04:56,020
What is this?

112
00:05:01,940 --> 00:05:05,970
Like seriously, what's going on?

113
00:05:06,170 --> 00:05:08,020
What's going on?

114
00:05:10,880 --> 00:05:12,110
Sensei…

115
00:05:12,850 --> 00:05:14,970
We're in the middle of class...

116
00:05:16,880 --> 00:05:19,170
Like mid-lecture...

117
00:05:26,310 --> 00:05:28,650
Seriously man, you’re freaking me out

118
00:05:30,400 --> 00:05:31,910
Can you call someone?

119
00:05:33,850 --> 00:05:35,250
Anyone?

120
00:05:39,200 --> 00:05:40,200
It’s no use…

121
00:05:41,080 --> 00:05:41,680
Huh?

122
00:05:41,480 --> 00:05:42,570
It’s no use…..

123
00:05:43,080 --> 00:05:44,000
No use?

124
00:05:43,820 --> 00:05:45,000
Absolutely no use...

125
00:05:45,200 --> 00:05:46,710
Absolutely no use?

126
00:05:47,540 --> 00:05:48,880
What's no use?

127
00:05:50,820 --> 00:05:53,280
It's just so difficult...

128
00:05:54,400 --> 00:05:57,650
So difficult... living like that...

129
00:05:59,140 --> 00:06:00,140
Sensei

130
00:06:01,940 --> 00:06:05,510
You can’t be empathizing with the sharks that much man…

131
00:06:06,800 --> 00:06:08,110
Th… y…

132
00:06:08,620 --> 00:06:09,200
Huh?

133
00:06:09,480 --> 00:06:11,710
Tha… yo…

134
00:06:13,220 --> 00:06:14,170
Thank you...

135
00:06:14,110 --> 00:06:15,110
Thank you?

136
00:06:16,140 --> 00:06:18,170
To what? To whom?

137
00:06:18,170 --> 00:06:19,540
What? Huh?

138
00:06:20,940 --> 00:06:24,050
Wh-what do you mean? What are you thanking?

139
00:06:26,740 --> 00:06:30,420
They're so… they're so…

140
00:06:33,600 --> 00:06:34,820
thank you...

141
00:06:35,600 --> 00:06:38,800
Thank you to what though? To whom?

142
00:06:41,250 --> 00:06:42,310
Sensei?

143
00:06:48,710 --> 00:06:50,250
Whoa, what the hell?

144
00:06:53,680 --> 00:06:56,200
You're scaring me man…

145
00:07:01,910 --> 00:07:03,220
Huh? What's going on?

146
00:07:03,370 --> 00:07:05,740
Uh... um...

147
00:07:06,600 --> 00:07:07,820
Sorry about that…

148
00:07:08,200 --> 00:07:09,050
Yeah…

149
00:07:08,600 --> 00:07:10,000
Sorry sorry.

150
00:07:10,880 --> 00:07:11,970
Uh…

151
00:07:12,170 --> 00:07:14,000
Hahahahaha…

152
00:07:14,450 --> 00:07:15,000
Huh?

153
00:07:15,510 --> 00:07:16,570
Hahahaha…

154
00:07:16,570 --> 00:07:17,370
Huh?

155
00:07:17,820 --> 00:07:18,940
Hahaha…

156
00:07:19,170 --> 00:07:20,370
What’s going on?

157
00:07:20,280 --> 00:07:24,020
Uh... Yeah... I'm really sorry about that...

158
00:07:25,200 --> 00:07:26,400
Oh no, here goes again…

159
00:07:26,650 --> 00:07:29,340
Here goes what again?

160
00:07:32,710 --> 00:07:36,050
Seriously, I have no idea what’s going on here...

161
00:07:38,140 --> 00:07:41,170
I don't get what's going on in his head, this guy

162
00:07:42,480 --> 00:07:46,370
He's on his knees... He can't even stand up anymore...

163
00:07:51,370 --> 00:07:54,020
Sorry about that. Uh... uh....

164
00:07:52,680 --> 00:07:54,080
Yeah...

165
00:07:54,250 --> 00:07:56,080
Class is over for today

166
00:07:55,570 --> 00:07:56,250
Huh?

167
00:07:56,480 --> 00:07:57,820
Uh... uh...

168
00:07:58,020 --> 00:08:03,970
If you have any, uh, questions, I’ll be in the, uh, teachers room.

169
00:08:04,250 --> 00:08:05,620
That’s it, bye

170
00:08:10,140 --> 00:08:11,620
What the hell was that?

171
00:08:12,080 --> 00:08:13,650
Weirdo...

172
