Could you speak a little loud please?

18
00:00:15,940 --> 00:00:17,940
Put some more punch in your voice

19
00:00:18,360 --> 00:00:20,660
I tought I spoke loud enough...

20
00:00:19,480 --> 00:00:22,460
No, you sounded like a nice mom

21
00:00:22,460 --> 00:00:24,500
Ok, here my project

22
00:00:24,500 --> 00:00:25,340
Yeah, what's up with it ?

23
00:00:25,340 --> 00:00:30,140
Well, I haven't been tricked recently....

24
00:00:30,140 --> 00:00:33,540
We might be too old for it now

25
00:00:32,580 --> 00:00:34,460
You're past your prime

26
00:00:34,460 --> 00:00:35,820
No, I'm still good

27
00:00:35,820 --> 00:00:40,780
But don't we get laughs when I get punk'd??

28
00:00:40,780 --> 00:00:42,020
It's really funny stuff

29
00:00:43,760 --> 00:00:46,500
Says who?

30
00:00:46,160 --> 00:00:48,260
His wife Aya says so

31
00:00:47,500 --> 00:00:49,300
Right, my wife says I'm funny

32
00:00:49,300 --> 00:00:52,200
His wife Aya is his world right now

33
00:00:52,200 --> 00:00:56,160
Whatever he says, she said it first

34
00:00:56,160 --> 00:00:58,820
He's right, my family is my world

35
00:00:58,820 --> 00:01:03,620
I wanted to show you how good I am

36
00:01:02,340 --> 00:01:03,620
at being punk'd

37
00:01:04,700 --> 00:01:06,260
Acting skills?

Objective

39
00:01:04,700 --> 00:01:15,460
Yamasaki demonstrate his 'getting Punk'd' acting skills

40
00:01:06,260 --> 00:01:07,680
So it's all premeditated

41
00:01:07,680 --> 00:01:10,500
Yeah, I will already know it's a prank

42
00:01:10,500 --> 00:01:12,320
I think it will be funnier

43
00:01:12,320 --> 00:01:15,860
If I pretend like I don't know I'm punk'd

44
00:01:15,860 --> 00:01:20,020
Seriously, don't let us down

45
00:01:17,540 --> 00:01:19,120
Don't worry

46
00:01:19,360 --> 00:01:20,240

Right?

52
00:01:44,200 --> 00:01:48,800
Your nose hair is sticking out right now

53
00:01:47,700 --> 00:01:48,880
Serious?

54
00:01:48,880 --> 00:01:50,560
Is it a joke?

55
00:01:50,570 --> 00:01:51,670
Look at your nose hair

56
00:01:51,710 --> 00:01:52,950
Have I just been punk'd?

57
00:01:52,910 --> 00:01:54,350
Yes, you've been punk'd

58
00:01:55,280 --> 00:01:56,720
Don't punk me!

59
00:01:56,720 --> 00:02:01,400
It looks like beetle legs coming out from your nose

60
00:02:01,400 --> 00:02:03,740
We don't need to be punk'd

61
00:02:03,740 --> 00:02:05,740
Let us begin!

62
00:02:05,740 --> 00:02:07,320
How do we do this?

63
00:02:07,320 --> 00:02:13,160
I'm about to choose how I will get punk'd

64
00:02:13,500 --> 00:02:20,220

65
00:02:13,500 --> 00:02:20,220
Yamasaki picks one of the nine pranks

66
00:02:13,640 --> 00:02:15,500
That's the reason for the board

67
00:02:15,500 --> 00:02:16,480
Nine options

68
00:02:16,480 --> 00:02:17,640
Nine choices

69
00:02:17,640 --> 00:02:20,580
I'm gonna start with No. 1

70
00:02:20,580 --> 00:02:22,480

00:02:28,240 --> 00:02:29,620
Very popular trick

00:03:02,300 --> 00:03:03,620
We haven't had a new one in a while...

90
00:03:04,500 --> 00:03:06,180
Excuse me

91
00:03:09,760 --> 00:03:10,880

00:03:53,760 --> 00:03:55,760
Can you get me a coffee?

103
00:03:54,780 --> 00:03:55,800

105
00:04:07,700 --> 00:04:14,150
Perverted Yamasaki stares at her underwear

106
00:04:14,150 --> 00:04:15,100

115
00:05:03,100 --> 00:05:08,850
Stares between his fingers

116
00:05:17,680 --> 00:05:19,920
Hey, listen

117
00:05:19,930 --> 00:05:23,460
You haven't stopped looking at my boobs

118
00:05:23,490 --> 00:05:24,490
Well...

119
00:05:24,520 --> 00:05:26,860

122
00:05:37,630 --> 00:05:39,720
Can this be...!?

123
00:05:43,360 --> 00:05:45,180
Is this...

124
00:05:46,160 --> 00:05:48,300
They said "punk'd"?!!

125
00:05:48,980 --> 00:05:52,280
Damn...

126
00:05:52,810 --> 00:05:55,920
I knew something wasn't right

127
00:05:56,680 --> 00:05:57,200
You're right

128
00:05:57,200 --> 00:06:00,000

How did I do?

134
00:06:09,640 --> 00:06:12,360
did you see me doing this?

135
00:06:12,500 --> 00:06:13,840
Yeah, I noticed that

136
00:06:13,870 --> 00:06:17,680
It was supposed to be the funniest part

137
00:06:18,240 --> 00:06:20,000
I would point out

138
00:06:20,000 --> 00:06:24,620
that your acting was cheap

i just happened to find this but

150
00:06:50,620 --> 00:06:52,960
It's one of those scary books...

151
00:06:53,980 --> 00:06:54,960
That's scary

152
00:06:55,200 --> 00:06:58,380
Don't we attract ghosts by reading about them?

153
00:06:58,480 --> 00:07:04,750
Yamasaki's mind is on ghosts

154
00:06:58,980 --> 00:06:59,960
I've heard that

155
00:07:02,460 --> 00:07:04,700
I didn't mean to scare you...

156
00:07:08,480 --> 00:07:09,300
Bang

157
00:07:08,480 --> 00:07:09,300
Bang

158
00:07:08,950 --> 00:07:10,000
Yeah, this book is scary

159
00:07:12,560 --> 00:07:14,140
That scared me a little...

160
00:07:16,800 --> 00:07:17,800
Speaking of undying spirits...

161
00:07:17,800 --> 00:07:18,690
Bang

162
00:07:17,800 --> 00:07:18,690
Bang

163
00:07:19,550 --> 00:07:25,150
Yamasaki is uneasy about the banging noise

164
00:07:27,880 --> 00:07:28,980
What?

165
00:07:29,350 --> 00:07:30,660
Did you hear that?

166
00:07:30,660 --> 00:07:31,660
What?

167
00:07:32,270 --> 00:07:34,140
I heard a banging noise...

168
00:07:34,400 --> 00:07:35,860
I don't think it's anything...

169
00:07:36,040 --> 00:07:37,300
No, but seriously...

170
00:07:37,300 --> 00:07:39,300
It's like a Poltergeist

171
00:07:37,940 --> 00:07:42,540
Countdown to the
Tissues Moving

172
00:07:47,340 --> 00:07:51,880
The unexplained events leave Yamasaki jumpy

173
00:07:50,080 --> 00:07:52,620
The tissues just moved...

174
00:07:52,800 --> 00:07:53,560
You sure ?

175
00:07:53,400 --> 00:07:58,080
Countdown to the Plant Falling

176
00:07:54,000 --> 00:07:55,560
I'm not kidding

177
00:07:55,960 --> 00:07:57,880
I'm getting scared...

178
00:07:59,980 --> 00:08:00,840
What?

179
00:08:01,070 --> 00:08:03,000
I'm getting scared!

180
00:08:03,010 --> 00:08:04,660
I'm getting scared!

181
00:08:06,400 --> 00:08:11,070
Secret Trick

182
00:08:10,820 --> 00:08:12,080
But...it moved!

183
00:08:32,820 --> 00:08:34,760
Yamasaki...

184
00:08:35,720 --> 00:08:38,700
"I'm getting scared!!"

185
00:08:38,700 --> 00:08:42,620
is so unrealistic and fake

186
00:08:42,620 --> 00:08:45,340
What do you mean, "I'm getting scared"?

187
00:08:45,920 --> 00:08:47,300
But why?

188
00:08:47,300 --> 00:08:48,840
"I'm getting scared"

189
00:08:48,840 --> 00:08:51,040
I was conveying my emotion

190
00:08:51,040 --> 00:08:53,880
You could tell how emotionally charged I was getting

191
00:08:53,880 --> 00:08:57,480
How about reacting after you find out you've been tricked?

192
00:08:57,480 --> 00:09:00,020
Right, you didn't react at all

193
00:09:00,020 --> 00:09:02,020
That's the crucial part of the show

194
00:09:00,980 --> 00:09:04,660
Your mood didn't change at all

195
00:09:04,720 --> 00:09:06,740
And that's fundamental

196
00:09:05,850 --> 00:09:06,790
I agree

197
00:09:06,850 --> 00:09:10,520
I was anticipating the change...

198
00:09:10,650 --> 00:09:12,120
No. 5!!

199
00:09:13,700 --> 00:09:17,960
Whoopee Cushion Prank

200
00:09:14,520 --> 00:09:16,260
This is a ...

201
00:09:16,720 --> 00:09:17,960
Old school...

202
00:09:17,960 --> 00:09:20,000
This could be a game changer

203
00:09:20,000 --> 00:09:23,980
If you can execute this well, it'll be good

204
00:09:24,010 --> 00:09:29,010
I just farted

205
00:09:24,010 --> 00:09:29,010
Toot

206
00:09:24,010 --> 00:09:29,010
Yama-chan Becomes Embarrassed!

207
00:09:28,980 --> 00:09:31,640
Excuse me but...

208
00:09:32,040 --> 00:09:34,080
My stomach is...

209
00:09:34,080 --> 00:09:39,500
Yamasaki conveniently leaves the room

210
00:09:34,880 --> 00:09:36,710
Let me go trim my nose hair

211
00:09:36,780 --> 00:09:39,600
Which is it, your stomach or the nose hair?

212
00:09:41,580 --> 00:09:45,070
Well...

213
00:09:42,710 --> 00:09:45,070
what a terrible actor

214
00:09:45,360 --> 00:09:49,700
You two young comics shouldn't be watching this

215
00:09:50,520 --> 00:09:51,680
You won't learn anything from this

216
00:09:51,680 --> 00:09:53,560
It's not informative

217
00:09:53,560 --> 00:09:57,080
I haven't heard comments like that in the past 10 years

218
00:09:56,320 --> 00:09:57,040
Is that right?

219
00:10:02,700 --> 00:10:06,780
Here comes Komurasaki to start the prank

220
00:10:07,260 --> 00:10:13,840
Whoopee Cushion Set Up

221
00:10:10,400 --> 00:10:12,480
It won't be easy

222
00:10:12,660 --> 00:10:15,000
to act oblivious

223
00:10:16,560 --> 00:10:20,920
He will need to be convincing that he doesn't know

224
00:10:23,880 --> 00:10:25,180
That felt good

225
00:10:24,160 --> 00:10:27,440
Yamasaki has no idea

226
00:10:25,180 --> 00:10:25,860
You OK?

227
00:10:25,860 --> 00:10:27,360
Yes

228
00:10:28,800 --> 00:10:30,140
It's good that I went

229
00:10:30,140 --> 00:10:31,900
You shouldn't hold that stuff in

230
00:10:41,760 --> 00:10:43,100
What?

231
00:10:43,300 --> 00:10:45,100
What the hell?!!

232
00:10:45,280 --> 00:10:48,740
I thought I heard something!!

233
00:10:48,740 --> 00:10:49,820
I didn't hear anything

234
00:10:49,820 --> 00:10:52,720
Punk'd

235
00:10:52,760 --> 00:10:54,860
I didn't hear a sound

236
00:10:55,100 --> 00:10:57,400
Nothing,
I heard nothing

237
00:10:57,920 --> 00:10:59,660
I didn't hear anything unusual

238
00:11:00,730 --> 00:11:03,100
How was that?

239
00:11:06,780 --> 00:11:07,580
A do over?

240
00:11:07,580 --> 00:11:08,960
No. 3

241
00:11:11,450 --> 00:11:14,700
Yakuza Prank

242
00:11:11,500 --> 00:11:12,940
This is another standard gag...

243
00:11:14,900 --> 00:11:18,260
We've all seen comedians tricked by this one

244
00:11:18,260 --> 00:11:18,920
Right

245
00:11:18,920 --> 00:11:20,260
This is a perfect one for him

246
00:11:23,820 --> 00:11:26,080
This one should suit me perfectly...

247
00:11:26,780 --> 00:11:32,400
Fear!

248
00:11:26,780 --> 00:11:32,400
Yakuza Raid!

249
00:11:26,780 --> 00:11:32,400
Yama-chan Cries Out

250
00:11:32,860 --> 00:11:33,700
Don't mind us

251
00:11:34,060 --> 00:11:35,320
Here we are

252
00:11:34,140 --> 00:11:38,220
Fake Yakuza shows up

253
00:11:37,260 --> 00:11:38,040
Oh man,

254
00:11:38,280 --> 00:11:39,400
Hey

255
00:11:40,120 --> 00:11:41,980
Is that Matsumoto and Hamada over there?

256
00:11:41,980 --> 00:11:42,620
Oh!

257
00:11:43,100 --> 00:11:44,620
I watched them on TV

258
00:11:44,620 --> 00:11:45,700
Let's ask for something

259
00:11:45,700 --> 00:11:46,620
Go for it

260
00:11:46,620 --> 00:11:52,880
Fake Yakuza bothers Downtown

261
00:11:47,440 --> 00:11:48,440
Hey, do something

262
00:11:48,440 --> 00:11:49,360
Listen

263
00:11:49,360 --> 00:11:50,700
If you don't mind...

264
00:11:50,700 --> 00:11:51,560
C'mon man

265
00:11:51,560 --> 00:11:52,840
I don't care, do something

266
00:11:53,580 --> 00:11:54,440
Sorry about that

267
00:11:54,940 --> 00:11:55,840
Who the hell are you?

268
00:11:55,840 --> 00:11:56,820
We're having a meeting

269
00:11:56,820 --> 00:11:58,280
Get outta here

270
00:11:58,280 --> 00:11:59,040
Please leave us alone

271
00:12:00,280 --> 00:12:01,140
Wait, wait, wait a minute

272
00:12:01,140 --> 00:12:05,040
Yamasaki shows some balls

273
00:12:02,140 --> 00:12:02,760
Who are you?

274
00:12:02,760 --> 00:12:03,980
Get the hell outta here!

275
00:12:03,980 --> 00:12:05,160
Please leave us alone

276
00:12:05,160 --> 00:12:06,060
Please excuse us

277
00:12:07,600 --> 00:12:10,700
Yamasaki is shocked by the gun

278
00:12:09,340 --> 00:12:10,920
Hold it, hold it!

279
00:12:12,840 --> 00:12:16,160
The instigator is shot

280
00:12:18,420 --> 00:12:19,580
Get up!

281
00:12:19,580 --> 00:12:20,860
Wake up!

282
00:12:22,360 --> 00:12:24,120
Chest compression?!!

283
00:12:23,020 --> 00:12:28,360
Yamasaki desperately tries to resuscitate the victim

284
00:12:24,600 --> 00:12:25,780
Wake up!

285
00:12:25,780 --> 00:12:28,420
W...Why?!!!

286
00:12:29,560 --> 00:12:30,940
Way too dramatic...

287
00:12:30,940 --> 00:12:32,140
Get your ass up!

288
00:12:32,140 --> 00:12:33,340
Get up, asshole!

289
00:12:34,620 --> 00:12:37,320
You shot him

290
00:12:38,100 --> 00:12:39,560
And you're next in line

291
00:12:40,360 --> 00:12:41,030
No!

292
00:12:41,030 --> 00:12:42,230
No, no way!!

293
00:12:42,440 --> 00:12:43,140
Say your prayers

294
00:12:43,120 --> 00:12:48,160
Gun is aimed at Yamasaki

295
00:12:43,840 --> 00:12:44,240
No!

296
00:12:44,680 --> 00:12:45,480
Bye Bye

297
00:12:45,480 --> 00:12:46,920
Bye bye

298
00:12:46,920 --> 00:12:48,220
I don't wanna die!!

299
00:12:48,360 --> 00:12:49,200
A

300
00:12:49,660 --> 00:12:50,240
di

301
00:12:50,960 --> 00:12:51,640
Adios

302
00:13:00,640 --> 00:13:01,460
How many times...

303
00:13:03,240 --> 00:13:05,740
Where's your reaction afterwards?!

304
00:13:05,740 --> 00:13:07,600
That's the most essential part

305
00:13:07,600 --> 00:13:09,060
What's with you?

306
00:13:09,260 --> 00:13:12,940
Where's the reaction after you find out it's a prank?

307
00:13:12,940 --> 00:13:15,880
Other than your, "Yeah" or " Ahh"

308
00:13:15,960 --> 00:13:17,140
What is this ?

309
00:13:19,420 --> 00:13:20,300
But how was it?

310
00:13:20,300 --> 00:13:20,900
What?

311
00:13:20,900 --> 00:13:21,940
How did I do?

312
00:13:21,940 --> 00:13:23,220
What happened to your voice?

313
00:13:25,000 --> 00:13:27,140
Did you blow out your vocal cords?

314
00:13:27,520 --> 00:13:28,560
Toot!

315
00:13:32,280 --> 00:13:36,360
How come you can't react to that??!!

316
00:13:35,080 --> 00:13:36,340
It finally worked!!

317
00:13:37,020 --> 00:13:38,940
You missed your chance to shine!!

318
00:13:38,940 --> 00:13:40,500
A missed opportunity!

319
00:13:40,500 --> 00:13:43,760
But all you do was turn red

320
00:13:44,240 --> 00:13:46,300
What the hell are you doing?!

321
00:13:46,720 --> 00:13:48,060
That was terrible...

322
00:13:48,060 --> 00:13:50,920
You were like a little embarrassed girl

323
00:13:50,920 --> 00:13:52,100
What's with you?

324
00:13:52,100 --> 00:13:54,100
Get it together

325
00:13:56,580 --> 00:13:57,560
No. 7

326
00:13:59,740 --> 00:14:01,300
Well, here's another classic prank

327
00:13:59,760 --> 00:14:04,670
Here Comes a Gorilla

328
00:14:01,300 --> 00:14:04,080
Yamasaki, please get this right...

329
00:14:04,780 --> 00:14:05,980
So, like we said...

330
00:14:07,380 --> 00:14:08,340
Hamada-san, please...

331
00:14:08,340 --> 00:14:12,060
Show us your reaction after
you find out you've been punk'd

332
00:14:11,760 --> 00:14:13,440
He's said this numerous times

333
00:14:13,440 --> 00:14:14,620
Since the beginning of the show

334
00:14:14,620 --> 00:14:17,860
They might be edited out but he said it like four times

335
00:14:19,860 --> 00:14:22,000
I know, I get way too into it sometimes..

336
00:14:22,000 --> 00:14:23,940
I understand that

337
00:14:23,940 --> 00:14:27,020
No, I'm cool with you getting into it

338
00:14:28,060 --> 00:14:33,260
Even Tarzan Is Scared

339
00:14:28,060 --> 00:14:33,260
Gorilla Raid

340
00:14:28,060 --> 00:14:33,260
Yama-chan Panics!!

341
00:14:34,900 --> 00:14:35,780
Goooorilla!!

342
00:14:37,220 --> 00:14:38,380
Goorilla!!

343
00:14:43,660 --> 00:14:44,680
Goorilla!

344
00:14:49,160 --> 00:14:50,340
You missed again

345
00:14:54,740 --> 00:14:55,740
That was the cue

346
00:14:55,740 --> 00:14:57,000
What the...?!

347
00:14:58,880 --> 00:15:00,760
Your initial reaction was...

348
00:15:01,160 --> 00:15:03,320
one of the better ones I've seen today

349
00:15:03,320 --> 00:15:05,200
Great idea

350
00:15:05,200 --> 00:15:08,440
Shouting its name out loud

351
00:15:08,920 --> 00:15:10,600
That was unprecedented

352
00:15:10,600 --> 00:15:13,000
You called it,  "Goorilla!"

353
00:15:13,000 --> 00:15:14,440
I was smelling gold

354
00:15:14,440 --> 00:15:18,860
I thought, "Nice, he's a professional after all"

355
00:15:19,340 --> 00:15:21,180
But you can't finish strong

356
00:15:22,440 --> 00:15:23,460
What's this?

357
00:15:24,160 --> 00:15:25,940
I'm having a stomach issue

358
00:15:25,940 --> 00:15:29,180
I just can't shake it off

359
00:15:29,180 --> 00:15:30,940
well, better take care of it now

360
00:15:30,940 --> 00:15:32,460
I don't want any accidents in here

361
00:15:32,450 --> 00:15:38,480
I just farted

362
00:15:32,450 --> 00:15:38,480
Toot

363
00:15:32,450 --> 00:15:38,480
Yama-chan Gets Embarrassed!

364
00:15:42,410 --> 00:15:45,620
Komurasaki Arrives

365
00:15:46,080 --> 00:15:51,100
to set up the Whoopee Cushion

366
00:15:55,400 --> 00:15:59,280
Yamasaki has no idea

367
00:15:57,040 --> 00:15:57,440
You OK?

368
00:15:57,440 --> 00:15:59,840
Yes, i think I took care of it

369
00:16:00,280 --> 00:16:02,000
That should be the last time...

370
00:16:03,080 --> 00:16:05,300
You've always had issues with your stomach

371
00:16:06,600 --> 00:16:08,160
Thanks for you concern

372
00:16:08,560 --> 00:16:09,780
Toot!

373
00:16:13,600 --> 00:16:16,160
You didn't do anything just now

374
00:16:19,420 --> 00:16:21,580
Seriously, what's up?

375
00:16:22,300 --> 00:16:24,440
We're no asking for an Oscar moment

376
00:16:25,020 --> 00:16:26,800
Just show us something

377
00:16:28,380 --> 00:16:31,680
It's been awhile, I'm still rusty

378
00:16:32,820 --> 00:16:34,480
You're still rusty?

379
00:16:38,580 --> 00:16:39,760
No. 6

380
00:16:40,760 --> 00:16:44,620
Time Bomb Prank

381
00:16:45,840 --> 00:16:49,080
Much respect if you can pull this off

382
00:16:47,920 --> 00:16:49,060
This one's tough

383
00:16:49,820 --> 00:16:51,900
This is complex

384
00:16:51,900 --> 00:16:54,840
It calls for a very tense mood

385
00:16:55,300 --> 00:16:57,480
Right, it's a life or death situation

386
00:16:57,480 --> 00:17:00,140
It's an unrealistic situation

387
00:17:00,280 --> 00:17:03,260
Unrealistic, but very tense

388
00:17:03,460 --> 00:17:04,520
And you know it's fake

389
00:17:04,520 --> 00:17:05,740
Premeditated

390
00:17:05,740 --> 00:17:10,600
You'll have more admirers if you can pull this off

391
00:17:10,600 --> 00:17:12,960
That sounds good

392
00:17:14,080 --> 00:17:16,000
This won't be easy

393
00:17:18,250 --> 00:17:23,620
Disable the Time-Bomb

394
00:17:18,250 --> 00:17:23,620
Red

395
00:17:18,250 --> 00:17:23,620
Yama-chan Saves the Day!

396
00:17:18,250 --> 00:17:23,620
or Blue!?

397
00:17:25,160 --> 00:17:26,940
May I have you attention?

398
00:17:25,960 --> 00:17:31,700
The Fake Cops Arrive

399
00:17:26,940 --> 00:17:28,800
We've just received a bomb threat

400
00:17:31,700 --> 00:17:33,440
There's a bomb set up somewhere in this building

401
00:17:33,440 --> 00:17:37,740
Please check your surroundings for anything suspicious

402
00:17:37,960 --> 00:17:40,780
It could be anywhere in this room

403
00:17:41,980 --> 00:17:42,740
Oh!

404
00:17:42,740 --> 00:17:43,540
Wait

405
00:17:43,540 --> 00:17:45,320
What's this?

406
00:17:44,560 --> 00:17:51,260
Suspicious bag found under the table

407
00:17:46,700 --> 00:17:47,860
Where did this come from?!

408
00:17:48,380 --> 00:17:49,780
That's a huge bag

409
00:17:49,780 --> 00:17:51,280
Place it on the table

410
00:17:51,700 --> 00:17:52,440
Please open it

411
00:17:52,440 --> 00:17:54,640
Whose is this?!

412
00:17:54,640 --> 00:17:56,560
If you could open that, please

413
00:17:56,560 --> 00:17:58,760
Open it here?

414
00:17:59,880 --> 00:18:03,840
Yamasaki struggles to open it

415
00:18:08,020 --> 00:18:09,240
So it's true...

416
00:18:08,710 --> 00:18:13,100
Time Bomb Discovery

417
00:18:13,100 --> 00:18:13,940
Wait a sec!!

418
00:18:13,940 --> 00:18:15,520
It's a time bomb!!

419
00:18:15,520 --> 00:18:16,920
OK, you!!

420
00:18:16,920 --> 00:18:18,920
Take this, take this!!

421
00:18:18,920 --> 00:18:20,020
Less than a minute left!

422
00:18:18,920 --> 00:18:23,280
Officer hands him the wire cutters

423
00:18:20,760 --> 00:18:22,280
47 seconds left!

424
00:18:22,520 --> 00:18:23,130
No way!!

425
00:18:22,520 --> 00:18:23,500
I don't want this!

426
00:18:23,130 --> 00:18:23,930
You'll be fine!

427
00:18:23,500 --> 00:18:25,360
No! I don't want them!!

428
00:18:23,930 --> 00:18:25,330
I don't wanna do this!!

429
00:18:25,480 --> 00:18:25,980
Wait!!

430
00:18:25,980 --> 00:18:26,980
Cut the wire

431
00:18:27,860 --> 00:18:28,600
40 seconds!

432
00:18:28,600 --> 00:18:29,560
Cut it!

433
00:18:29,560 --> 00:18:30,880
No way!!

434
00:18:30,880 --> 00:18:31,860
No!!

435
00:18:31,860 --> 00:18:32,600
Wait a sec!!

436
00:18:33,000 --> 00:18:33,820
35 seconds left!

437
00:18:33,920 --> 00:18:35,120
Please hurry!

438
00:18:35,940 --> 00:18:36,720
look!

439
00:18:37,780 --> 00:18:39,000
It's gonna explode!

440
00:18:38,600 --> 00:18:43,680
Yamasaki panics

441
00:18:46,680 --> 00:18:47,480
Please!

442
00:18:47,480 --> 00:18:48,580
Hurry up!

443
00:18:51,540 --> 00:18:52,680
14 seconds!

444
00:18:52,680 --> 00:18:53,540
which one?!!

445
00:18:57,160 --> 00:18:58,180
Cut it!

446
00:18:58,180 --> 00:18:58,920
6 seconds!

447
00:19:01,800 --> 00:19:02,420
3!

448
00:19:09,420 --> 00:19:11,240
I got it?!

449
00:19:15,100 --> 00:19:15,800
Well, well

450
00:19:15,800 --> 00:19:16,540
Yamasaki-san

451
00:19:17,840 --> 00:19:21,020
"I got it!?"

452
00:19:21,460 --> 00:19:24,400
It was like a punchline

453
00:19:24,520 --> 00:19:25,440
What the hell??

454
00:19:26,380 --> 00:19:30,060
I understand it's very tense but

455
00:19:30,060 --> 00:19:31,760
Yeah, I would for sure

456
00:19:31,760 --> 00:19:32,340
You're sure?

457
00:19:32,340 --> 00:19:35,160
Yes, especially with six sticks of dynamite

458
00:19:35,160 --> 00:19:37,500
I have to point out

459
00:19:37,500 --> 00:19:39,260
how carefully you held

460
00:19:39,260 --> 00:19:43,260
the wire cutters so no one gets hurt

461
00:19:43,260 --> 00:19:44,140
I thought, "Man..."

462
00:19:44,140 --> 00:19:44,980
That was really calm

463
00:19:44,980 --> 00:19:46,740
I lost it right then

464
00:19:58,320 --> 00:19:59,840
If you wanna go there...

465
00:19:59,840 --> 00:20:01,680
Show me how it's done then!

466
00:20:02,200 --> 00:20:04,020
I'm telling you it's difficult

467
00:20:04,680 --> 00:20:06,340
I don't know why you're pissed off

468
00:20:06,340 --> 00:20:08,620
I mean, this was your idea after all

469
00:20:08,620 --> 00:20:11,080
But who do you want to see do this?

470
00:20:11,080 --> 00:20:11,820
Yeah, who?

471
00:20:11,820 --> 00:20:14,900
OK then, Matsumoto-san, you try it

472
00:20:15,640 --> 00:20:16,900
Which one?

473
00:20:18,040 --> 00:20:20,520
Please do the "Time-Bomb" segment

474
00:20:19,260 --> 00:20:20,460
What?!

475
00:20:20,700 --> 00:20:22,320
Anything but that!

476
00:20:22,320 --> 00:20:23,060
"Time-Bomb"!!

477
00:20:23,060 --> 00:20:25,100
No, the "Time-Bomb" is very...

478
00:20:25,100 --> 00:20:28,340
I can't do that all yelling and screaming

479
00:20:28,340 --> 00:20:30,240
I know, I just went through it

480
00:20:30,240 --> 00:20:31,360
OK then

481
00:20:31,360 --> 00:20:33,000
Let's roll, "Time-Bomb"!!

482
00:20:35,480 --> 00:20:37,320
I need to really focus

483
00:20:37,320 --> 00:20:38,620
Yes, it requires a lot

484
00:20:38,620 --> 00:20:42,480
I might need about two bananas to get through this

485
00:20:42,980 --> 00:20:44,080
I'm burning some calories for this

486
00:20:44,960 --> 00:20:46,240
I'm ready to go

487
00:20:52,230 --> 00:20:57,230
Diffuse the Time-Bomb

488
00:20:52,230 --> 00:20:57,230
Mattchan Saves the day!

489
00:20:52,230 --> 00:20:57,230
Red

490
00:20:52,230 --> 00:20:57,230
or Blue?

491
00:20:58,740 --> 00:21:00,040
May I have you attention, please?!

492
00:21:00,560 --> 00:21:02,760
We just received a bomb threat

493
00:21:00,920 --> 00:21:05,420
The Fake Cops Arrive

494
00:21:03,240 --> 00:21:06,060
the bomb is somewhere in this building

495
00:21:06,060 --> 00:21:07,260
What?!

496
00:21:07,260 --> 00:21:08,340
Are you serious?

497
00:21:08,340 --> 00:21:11,440
Please check your surroundings

498
00:21:11,740 --> 00:21:12,700
Check for any suspicious items

499
00:21:12,700 --> 00:21:13,820
How can it be?!

500
00:21:15,140 --> 00:21:16,440
Is this it?!

501
00:21:16,240 --> 00:21:21,500
Suspicious bag found under the table

502
00:21:18,600 --> 00:21:19,220
Whose is that?!

503
00:21:19,220 --> 00:21:20,780
Carefully place it on the table

504
00:21:23,000 --> 00:21:24,540
I'm scared, this is scary

505
00:21:25,020 --> 00:21:26,260
Open it, please

506
00:21:26,260 --> 00:21:27,180
I'm opening it?!

507
00:21:27,180 --> 00:21:27,520
Please

508
00:21:27,520 --> 00:21:28,960
That doesn't make sense!

509
00:21:32,400 --> 00:21:34,200
Not good, not good, not good

510
00:21:34,200 --> 00:21:36,020
This is bad

511
00:21:34,420 --> 00:21:39,080
Time-bomb found

512
00:21:36,400 --> 00:21:37,340
This is bad news

513
00:21:37,340 --> 00:21:38,540
No, no, no!

514
00:21:39,200 --> 00:21:40,600
Ok you, take this!

515
00:21:39,660 --> 00:21:40,380
54 seconds left!

516
00:21:40,720 --> 00:21:42,760
Why do I have to do this?!!

517
00:21:43,180 --> 00:21:44,960
Give it to Hamada!

518
00:21:43,210 --> 00:21:48,950
Matsumoto Gets the Wire Cutters

519
00:21:45,680 --> 00:21:46,900
This isn't right!

520
00:21:47,500 --> 00:21:48,720
I don't know what I'm doing!

521
00:21:48,960 --> 00:21:50,340
Why don't you do it!

522
00:21:51,100 --> 00:21:53,200
I'm not trained for this!!

523
00:21:54,880 --> 00:21:56,580
It's gonna blow up!

524
00:21:57,880 --> 00:21:58,780
34 seconds left!

525
00:22:01,100 --> 00:22:03,060
Cut, cut, cut, cut it!

526
00:22:04,040 --> 00:22:05,240
Please cut it

527
00:22:06,600 --> 00:22:08,280
I'm terrified

528
00:22:09,880 --> 00:22:15,650
Matsumoto is in full panic mode

529
00:22:12,060 --> 00:22:12,780
10 seconds!

530
00:22:13,500 --> 00:22:14,360
I'm scared!

531
00:22:14,360 --> 00:22:15,160
Cut it

532
00:22:20,140 --> 00:22:20,740
One!

533
00:22:29,660 --> 00:22:32,220
Impossible...

534
00:22:32,220 --> 00:22:33,620
Impossible...

535
00:22:40,160 --> 00:22:41,440
This was...

536
00:22:42,440 --> 00:22:43,860
I've never heard you be so loud

537
00:22:43,860 --> 00:22:44,840
Very loud

538
00:22:44,840 --> 00:22:51,260
The persistent feeling of humiliation

539
00:22:51,260 --> 00:22:53,960
Someone else has to try this

540
00:22:53,960 --> 00:22:55,800
I don't wanna be the only loser

541
00:22:56,080 --> 00:22:57,220
We might as well...

542
00:22:57,220 --> 00:22:59,320
We gotta pick someone to do this

543
00:23:05,760 --> 00:23:07,380
Ohnuma-san...

544
00:23:09,820 --> 00:23:10,640
I like it

545
00:23:10,720 --> 00:23:14,190
"Gorilla" Prank

546
00:23:14,440 --> 00:23:17,320
Pretend it's a real gorilla, OK?

547
00:23:17,840 --> 00:23:21,440
if you let yourself think it's a gorilla costume,

548
00:23:21,440 --> 00:23:24,700
you won't make it

549
00:23:26,920 --> 00:23:32,050
Even Tarzan Is Scared

550
00:23:26,920 --> 00:23:32,050
Gorilla Raid

551
00:23:26,920 --> 00:23:32,050
Ohnuma panics!!

552
00:23:44,120 --> 00:23:45,600
You serious?

553
00:23:45,600 --> 00:23:49,380
How lame?!
