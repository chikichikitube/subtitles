00:00:02,250 --> 00:00:07,050
Welcome to Wednesday Downtown everybody!

5
00:00:08,820 --> 00:00:11,490
This is our first person, please enter !

6
00:00:17,800 --> 00:00:21,030
Please welcome Kazuhiro Ozawa !

7
00:00:21,030 --> 00:00:22,430
Happy to be here

8
00:00:22,450 --> 00:00:25,500
This time, I have a theory, but

9
00:00:25,500 --> 00:00:28,510
before it, please take a look at this.

10
00:00:31,340 --> 00:00:33,350
This T-shirt..

11
00:00:33,510 --> 00:00:37,150
Do you know what kind of T-shirt it is?

12
00:00:35,980 --> 00:00:37,150
What kind?

13
00:00:37,150 --> 00:00:38,120
It's Clash right?

14
00:00:38,120 --> 00:00:40,620
"The Clash" is a band

15
00:00:39,750 --> 00:00:40,620
A band right?

16
00:00:41,050 --> 00:00:42,320
A band from London right?

17
00:00:42,320 --> 00:00:45,620
One of London's three biggest punk bands, "The Clash"

18
00:00:45,620 --> 00:00:48,990
I really like these "The Clash" band T-shirts.

19
00:00:48,990 --> 00:00:51,900
One day, one of my juniors was wearing a Clash T-shirt,

20
00:00:51,900 --> 00:00:53,030
I was really happy.

21
00:00:53,270 --> 00:00:56,370
I asked him "Do you like Joe Strummer? Have you heard of him?"

22
00:00:57,370 --> 00:00:58,440
He was a member right?

23
00:00:58,440 --> 00:00:59,270
Then,

24
00:00:59,270 --> 00:01:01,810
And then he asked me : "Who is Joe Strummer?"

25
00:01:01,810 --> 00:01:04,310
Joe Strummer is the vocalist of The Clash.

26
00:01:04,310 --> 00:01:05,080
The main?

27
00:01:05,080 --> 00:01:06,240
Indeed

28
00:01:06,240 --> 00:01:12,350
It's like someone wearing a Downtown T-shirt without knowing who Matsumoto is.

29
00:01:12,350 --> 00:01:14,190
Oh I see

30
00:01:14,190 --> 00:01:17,490
I don't know whether there is a Downtown T shirt or not

31
00:01:17,490 --> 00:01:18,860
For example yeah

32
00:01:18,860 --> 00:01:22,500
So for kids who are out of order

33
00:01:22,730 --> 00:01:27,130
I brought today the theory that will strike the final blow on them

34
00:01:27,130 --> 00:01:28,400
Please

35
00:01:29,330 --> 00:01:37,240
Asking people wearing band T shirt in town if they know the intro song of the band and if they can not answer, the T-shirt is confiscated and they can't complain.

36
00:01:37,240 --> 00:01:38,410
I see

37
00:01:38,410 --> 00:01:41,050
Although it is strict, it's not that I don't understand it

38
00:01:41,050 --> 00:01:42,910
So like "You know about them?"

39
00:01:41,910 --> 00:01:42,910
Exactly

40
00:01:43,150 --> 00:01:48,350
Let's wear a Downtown t-shirt and do a kidnapping joke material quiz !

41
00:01:48,350 --> 00:01:52,220
But, there is no Downtown T shirt !

42
00:01:51,220 --> 00:01:52,220
Really ?

43
00:01:52,890 --> 00:01:56,760
After this, people in the street wearing band T shirts taking the intro quiz

44
00:01:57,300 --> 00:01:58,100
Moreover,

45
00:01:58,830 --> 00:02:02,100
The older you get, the shorter a day seems (Theory)

46
00:02:02,100 --> 00:02:06,270
Get out of the room after exactly 24 hours

47
00:02:06,810 --> 00:02:09,740
Why some people wear sunglasses in the middle of the night

48
00:02:10,310 --> 00:02:13,250
The question of the fear of the number 4 in Japan's buildings

49
00:02:29,790 --> 00:02:34,870
Verifying the theory of people wearing band T shirt in town and if you can not answer the band's intro quiz

50
00:02:34,870 --> 00:02:40,440
the T-shirt is confiscated and you can't complain.

51
00:02:41,040 --> 00:02:44,110
Therefore, starting the investigation.

52
00:02:44,440 --> 00:02:46,210
Then, immediately

53
00:02:50,580 --> 00:02:54,190
Nirvana T-shirt discovered

54
00:02:51,920 --> 00:02:55,050
Because of the charisma

55
00:02:53,050 --> 00:02:55,050
I don't know about that

56
00:02:54,650 --> 00:02:56,390
Excuse me

57
00:02:56,390 --> 00:02:58,320
It's for TBS television

58
00:02:58,320 --> 00:03:01,590
We would like to do an interview

59
00:03:00,790 --> 00:03:01,590
Yes

60
00:03:01,590 --> 00:03:05,860
Is it ok if we ask you one or two questions?

61
00:03:04,030 --> 00:03:05,860
Sure

62
00:03:05,860 --> 00:03:07,000
Here is the question :

63
00:03:07,000 --> 00:03:09,070
What is the title of this song ?

64
00:03:10,100 --> 00:03:12,140
It's the most famous one

65
00:03:15,840 --> 00:03:18,980
He doesn't know at all

66
00:03:16,610 --> 00:03:18,980
It just started though

67
00:03:18,980 --> 00:03:21,150
Maybe he doesn't know about Nirvana

68
00:03:21,150 --> 00:03:22,680
Does he know it or not?

69
00:03:24,880 --> 00:03:26,320
Answer !

70
00:03:26,120 --> 00:03:27,590
No, I don't know it

71
00:03:29,390 --> 00:03:33,230
This is like doing "Linda Linda" by Blue Hearts

72
00:03:31,390 --> 00:03:33,230
Oh really?

73
00:03:33,530 --> 00:03:36,630
You don't know at all?

74
00:03:34,760 --> 00:03:36,630
I really don't know

75
00:03:36,630 --> 00:03:40,400
What do you know about the T-shirt you are wearing ?

76
00:03:40,400 --> 00:03:41,970
Oh this one?

77
00:03:43,130 --> 00:03:45,340
Nirabana

78
00:03:45,340 --> 00:03:47,270
Hm? One more time

79
00:03:47,270 --> 00:03:51,680
He doesn't even know Nirvana

80
00:03:51,680 --> 00:04:00,520
I bought it because of the design and cause a lot of hip-hop artists seem to wear it

81
00:04:01,190 --> 00:04:05,220
And now, explaining the project

82
00:04:05,690 --> 00:04:09,030
It's a bit embarrassing, isn't it ? Hahaha

83
00:04:09,590 --> 00:04:11,730
It is of no use to confiscate it

84
00:04:12,000 --> 00:04:16,030
We felt sorry for him being embarrassed so we exempt him

85
00:04:16,400 --> 00:04:18,700
Nirabana

86
00:04:19,140 --> 00:04:21,110
And then,

87
00:04:23,210 --> 00:04:28,010
Nirvana's Vocalist Kurt Cobain T-shirt

88
00:04:29,080 --> 00:04:30,280
With that said...

89
00:04:35,520 --> 00:04:37,820
I don't know at all

90
00:04:36,290 --> 00:04:37,820
I don't know

91
00:04:38,520 --> 00:04:39,960
I really don't know

92
00:04:40,330 --> 00:04:42,490
You don't know at all?

93
00:04:40,930 --> 00:04:42,490
I really don't know

94
00:04:43,160 --> 00:04:45,600
Another fail

95
00:04:46,260 --> 00:04:47,770
Who ? Whose is this song?

96
00:04:47,770 --> 00:04:48,930
Whose is this song?

97
00:04:49,230 --> 00:04:51,100
Could you please turn around?

98
00:04:53,570 --> 00:04:56,170
Eh, is this person singing?

99
00:04:56,170 --> 00:04:59,240
This one ? Is the singer this person?

100
00:04:59,240 --> 00:05:03,250
Eh, so this it?

101
00:04:59,910 --> 00:05:01,880
This is wrong

102
00:05:01,050 --> 00:05:03,250
So I was wearing it without knowing

103
00:05:04,680 --> 00:05:10,290
People from the countryside who don't know Kurt Cobain

104
00:05:10,290 --> 00:05:11,420
Where did you buy it?

105
00:05:11,420 --> 00:05:13,330
At the local Uniqlo

106
00:05:13,330 --> 00:05:17,130
And you don't know what kind of person he is?

107
00:05:14,760 --> 00:05:17,130
I have no clue

108
00:05:23,770 --> 00:05:25,070
Yes, from now on I'll remember it

109
00:05:25,070 --> 00:05:27,110
With this, I'll remember

110
00:05:27,770 --> 00:05:29,540
And then,

111
00:05:31,140 --> 00:05:34,450
Guns N' Roses

112
00:05:32,780 --> 00:05:35,080
I know this name

113
00:05:36,010 --> 00:05:38,580
You should know it

114
00:05:48,560 --> 00:05:52,060
Have you heard this before?

115
00:05:49,660 --> 00:05:52,060
No, I haven't

116
00:05:52,330 --> 00:05:53,930
So why are ya wearing it?

117
00:05:54,770 --> 00:05:56,330
Is it Guns?

118
00:05:56,330 --> 00:05:58,600
Guns N' Roses

119
00:05:58,870 --> 00:06:00,670
I know the name, but

120
00:06:00,670 --> 00:06:02,770
I have never heard the song itself.

121
00:06:02,770 --> 00:06:06,110
Because this is from a brand I like

122
00:06:06,110 --> 00:06:07,250
that's the only reason I bought it

123
00:06:07,250 --> 00:06:09,150
It's not because I especially like Guns N Roses

124
00:06:09,150 --> 00:06:10,380
I see

125
00:06:09,810 --> 00:06:11,480
Next one is..

126
00:06:12,980 --> 00:06:16,650
Iron Maiden

127
00:06:13,920 --> 00:06:15,720
You know a lot of them

128
00:06:15,720 --> 00:06:18,120
It's because I like Hard Rock

129
00:06:18,120 --> 00:06:19,190
Really?

130
00:06:18,690 --> 00:06:20,390
Yeah it's true

131
00:06:31,000 --> 00:06:32,100
I don't know

132
00:06:34,470 --> 00:06:36,240
Is it famous?

133
00:06:36,240 --> 00:06:39,110
It is.

134
00:06:39,110 --> 00:06:41,150
John Lennon

135
00:06:41,150 --> 00:06:44,150
For that kind of high tempo?

136
00:06:41,150 --> 00:06:44,150
Seriously

137
00:06:43,010 --> 00:06:44,150
It seems unexpected

138
00:06:44,580 --> 00:06:47,720
Even though a lot of people are wearing band t-shirt

139
00:06:48,450 --> 00:06:53,460
Someone who knows the song doesn't show up

140
00:06:54,930 --> 00:06:56,960
Among them

141
00:07:01,100 --> 00:07:06,170
This time, an artist from Japan : E.YAZAWA

142
00:07:06,170 --> 00:07:08,140
If you don't know this

143
00:07:08,140 --> 00:07:09,810
If you're not a fan, you don't wear it

144
00:07:10,040 --> 00:07:12,340
After this, we are going to Diamond Moon

145
00:07:12,340 --> 00:07:13,450
the shop.

146
00:07:15,410 --> 00:07:20,620
Parent and child go to a E.YAZAWA specialist shop.

147
00:07:21,350 --> 00:07:24,620
Even the kid's cap is E.YAZAWA

148
00:07:25,360 --> 00:07:29,130
They are expected to be able to answer

149
00:07:27,590 --> 00:07:29,790
For sure

150
00:07:31,200 --> 00:07:33,000
It is also the most famous one

151
00:07:33,000 --> 00:07:37,640
Even I could answer

152
00:07:44,640 --> 00:07:47,110
Did you get it ?

153
00:07:45,480 --> 00:07:47,110
Intro..

154
00:07:47,110 --> 00:07:48,610
I don't know.

155
00:07:49,410 --> 00:07:51,780
Unexpected incorrect answer

156
00:07:51,780 --> 00:07:55,920
The title is [Don't stop, Ha Ha]

157
00:07:54,190 --> 00:07:55,920
Aaa

158
00:07:55,920 --> 00:07:59,290
Now that you said it

159
00:07:59,290 --> 00:08:02,760
I don't really listen to this one

160
00:08:03,500 --> 00:08:04,760
Next one is

161
00:08:07,170 --> 00:08:10,900
Rolling Stones T-shirt

162
00:08:10,900 --> 00:08:12,870
Please give the title

163
00:08:18,040 --> 00:08:19,940
Correct

164
00:08:20,140 --> 00:08:21,150
Do you like it?

165
00:08:21,150 --> 00:08:23,310
I really like it, please look at this

166
00:08:24,280 --> 00:08:29,290
Discovery of a true fan wearing a band T-shirt.

167
00:08:29,750 --> 00:08:31,490
Furthermore,

168
00:08:33,390 --> 00:08:34,630
It's Guns

169
00:08:36,630 --> 00:08:38,130
The Shanananani~ song

170
00:08:41,330 --> 00:08:43,470
Rock'n Roll Radio

171
00:08:45,440 --> 00:08:47,140
I know it

172
00:08:47,140 --> 00:08:52,880
This is from Metallica, Enter Sandman

173
00:08:56,950 --> 00:08:59,880
From the album Jazz, Bicycle Race

174
00:09:00,390 --> 00:09:04,060
As expected, real fans give correct answers immediately

175
00:09:04,660 --> 00:09:09,560
Only 5 people gave the correct answer

176
00:09:09,560 --> 00:09:12,230
Red Hot Chili Peppers ?

177
00:09:12,930 --> 00:09:14,800
Gins..

178
00:09:14,000 --> 00:09:14,800
Guns

179
00:09:14,800 --> 00:09:17,740
Looks like "Guns Nose"

180
00:09:17,740 --> 00:09:18,800
Guns...

181
00:09:19,670 --> 00:09:20,870
Guns N' Rosie

182
00:09:22,640 --> 00:09:24,740
It's Guns N' Roses !

183
00:09:23,470 --> 00:09:24,740
Guns N' Roses

184
00:09:24,740 --> 00:09:26,910
This guy? That's his?

185
00:09:28,150 --> 00:09:30,080
I forgot...

186
00:09:30,750 --> 00:09:35,590
Only people who do not even know the artist, the band or the song.

187
00:09:36,020 --> 00:09:43,090
Intro Correct Rate, 5 / 51 [10%]

188
00:09:43,560 --> 00:09:45,760
Then, there is no longer band T-shirts, but

189
00:09:46,100 --> 00:09:50,440
How about T-shirts often seen in town ?

190
00:09:54,370 --> 00:09:56,570
Che Guevara

191
00:09:56,570 --> 00:09:58,340
There are a lot

192
00:09:58,640 --> 00:10:02,510
Was there ever a time where you groveled in front of someone?

193
00:10:02,510 --> 00:10:04,220
Probably not

194
00:10:04,680 --> 00:10:10,990
This time we conduct a separate interview
involving those wearing Che Guevara T-shirts

195
00:10:10,990 --> 00:10:13,520
Maybe then I would have done dogeza

196
00:10:14,100 --> 00:10:19,980
The following day, we asked them to come into the studio wearing the same clothes.

197
00:10:18,220 --> 00:10:20,130
He's looks so wary

198
00:10:20,120 --> 00:10:23,500
It is pretty suspicious

199
00:10:20,870 --> 00:10:22,700
Please have a seat

200
00:10:21,480 --> 00:10:23,500
Wow

201
00:10:23,800 --> 00:10:25,820
excuse me...

202
00:10:24,820 --> 00:10:26,940
Gotta be uncomfortable.

203
00:10:27,140 --> 00:10:29,120
It's scary, huh?

204
00:10:32,880 --> 00:10:35,020
Scary, isn't it?

205
00:10:36,480 --> 00:10:39,220
A Guevara T-shirt...

206
00:10:37,740 --> 00:10:39,780
Incredible

207
00:10:41,200 --> 00:10:43,720
Same shirt again

208
00:10:41,600 --> 00:10:43,720
There's a lot on that one

209
00:10:42,600 --> 00:10:45,040
Same shirt.

210
00:10:45,300 --> 00:10:47,460
It's a colorful one

211
00:10:47,460 --> 00:10:52,140
It appears they realize they're all wearing Che Guevara.

212
00:10:53,120 --> 00:10:55,960
With that said, what awaits the unsuspecting four

213
00:10:56,260 --> 00:11:00,240
is a Guevara Quiz which starts now

214
00:11:00,410 --> 00:11:03,510
If they like him they should be able to answer

215
00:11:01,860 --> 00:11:03,510
They should

216
00:11:03,710 --> 00:11:06,510
Let's start with the first question

217
00:11:07,020 --> 00:11:13,620
What is the name of the person who is pictured on everyone's T-shirt?

218
00:11:12,940 --> 00:11:15,100
That's obvious

219
00:11:15,180 --> 00:11:17,100
There might be some weird ones

220
00:11:17,120 --> 00:11:19,500
Some might've bought it for the design

221
00:11:22,320 --> 00:11:26,220
Everyone, please reveal your answers on the board

222
00:11:28,780 --> 00:11:31,080
All right, we have them all

223
00:11:31,220 --> 00:11:32,260
Well then

224
00:11:32,020 --> 00:11:34,600
"GEvera?"

225
00:11:32,370 --> 00:11:36,410
Hirose, could you please read your answer to us?

226
00:11:34,900 --> 00:11:36,800
GEvera is kind of...

227
00:11:36,410 --> 00:11:38,610
Chu Gevera

228
00:11:38,610 --> 00:11:41,480
Once more please

229
00:11:40,020 --> 00:11:41,480
Chu Gevera

230
00:11:41,560 --> 00:11:43,200
Chu Gevera

231
00:11:45,100 --> 00:11:46,820
Of course, the correct answer is...

232
00:11:46,820 --> 00:11:48,440
Che Guevara

233
00:11:48,440 --> 00:11:49,460
Che Guevara (duh)

234
00:11:49,460 --> 00:11:50,330
It's Che Guevara

235
00:11:51,160 --> 00:11:53,340
Che Guevara

236
00:11:53,660 --> 00:11:55,790
It's hard to pronounce, heh

237
00:11:56,030 --> 00:11:58,160
The pronunciation?

238
00:11:56,590 --> 00:11:58,160
Don't you think so?

239
00:11:58,500 --> 00:12:00,440
He said it

240
00:11:58,900 --> 00:12:00,500
Can I just go home?

241
00:12:00,970 --> 00:12:02,000
You can't yet

242
00:12:02,000 --> 00:12:03,370
But I reaaally want to go home

243
00:12:05,600 --> 00:12:08,680
We continued on with the Guevara Quiz.

244
00:12:06,640 --> 00:12:10,220
"Can I go home"?

245
00:12:07,620 --> 00:12:09,370
This guy is impossible!

246
00:12:10,220 --> 00:12:12,280
And so the results are as follows

247
00:12:14,150 --> 00:12:16,480
- Argentina
(Where was Che Guevara born?)

248
00:12:18,120 --> 00:12:20,420
- Bolivia
(Where was his place of death?)

249
00:12:20,420 --> 00:12:22,120
That's impressive

250
00:12:21,750 --> 00:12:24,190
- Cigar
(What is Che Guevara's favorite item on the battlefield that was also used as insect repellent?)

251
00:12:25,390 --> 00:12:27,930
- Nikon
(What brand is Che Guevara's favorite camera?)

252
00:12:28,800 --> 00:12:30,430
All correct!

253
00:12:30,180 --> 00:12:32,760
Unbelievable

254
00:12:30,430 --> 00:12:35,000
Having answered all questions regarding Che Guevara correctly, he attains victory

255
00:12:30,900 --> 00:12:32,760
Dang, he the real deal

256
00:12:35,020 --> 00:12:36,620
I'm incredibly happy

257
00:12:36,670 --> 00:12:37,940
Lastly, Hirose

258
00:12:38,040 --> 00:12:39,380
Yeah......

259
00:12:39,870 --> 00:12:41,440
What are your thoughts on today's quiz?

260
00:12:41,910 --> 00:12:44,310
I'll never wear this T-shirt again in my life

261
00:12:44,310 --> 00:12:45,440
Hmph

262
00:12:45,920 --> 00:12:52,320
With that said, it is advisable to know what is written/drawn on your own T-shirt

263
00:12:52,580 --> 00:12:54,700
I see

264
00:12:53,180 --> 00:12:54,700
Wow

265
00:12:54,700 --> 00:12:56,180
Those were the results, but...

266
00:12:56,180 --> 00:13:01,530
it seems like the older people wore it because they liked it and the younger people wore it for fashion.

267
00:13:02,300 --> 00:13:06,100
It was sad for that kid. He won't be able to wear that.

268
00:13:06,200 --> 00:13:07,700
"GE-GEvera"
- Guevera isn't it?

269
00:13:07,700 --> 00:13:11,220
In exchange, the show should've given him a t-shirt.

270
00:13:11,220 --> 00:13:13,360
Maybe a Wednesday Downtown t-shirt.

271
00:13:13,360 --> 00:13:15,660
Oh, right. Something like that.

272
00:13:15,660 --> 00:13:18,600
Want to make one?

273
00:13:16,360 --> 00:13:18,600
A Wednesday Downtown T-shirt

274
00:13:18,600 --> 00:13:22,810
Except this show could end at any time and it wouldn't be surprising.

275
00:13:22,810 --> 00:13:24,480
I don't want it to end.

276
00:13:22,810 --> 00:13:24,480
Is that so?

277
00:13:24,480 --> 00:13:26,480
On the edge

278
00:13:24,980 --> 00:13:26,480
So unstable

279
00:13:28,480 --> 00:13:31,500
Let's move onto the next presenter - this person!

280
00:13:38,380 --> 00:13:41,530
Please welcome Viking's Kotoge!

281
00:13:47,480 --> 00:13:49,500
Are you a senior citizen?

282
00:13:48,380 --> 00:13:49,500
No, not at all!

283
00:13:49,940 --> 00:13:51,020
You're mistaken.

284
00:13:50,420 --> 00:13:51,980
I'm wrong?

285
00:13:51,020 --> 00:13:53,300
You asked so kindly.

286
00:13:54,620 --> 00:13:57,050
Are you young?

287
00:13:55,080 --> 00:13:57,050
I'm young, I'm young, yes.

288
00:13:57,050 --> 00:13:58,520
You forgot your bolo tie.

289
00:13:58,560 --> 00:14:00,880
Nah, I'm not old-- I'm not an old man!

290
00:14:00,880 --> 00:14:03,440
Not an old man?
- A bolo tie is an old man's accessory.

291
00:14:03,440 --> 00:14:06,240
Right now I'm 40. I don't wear bolo ties.

292
00:14:06,240 --> 00:14:08,540
Isn't 40 kind of an old man?

293
00:14:08,540 --> 00:14:11,240
40 isn't really. It's middle-aged.

294
00:14:11,240 --> 00:14:12,240
How old are you Matsumoto-san?

295
00:14:12,220 --> 00:14:13,200
I'm 52

296
00:14:13,200 --> 00:14:15,270
THAT'S OLD!!

297
00:14:15,260 --> 00:14:16,670
You're an old fart!!

298
00:14:17,200 --> 00:14:19,280
Well, yeah. I'm an old man ain't I!

299
00:14:17,840 --> 00:14:19,280
Exactly!

300
00:14:19,280 --> 00:14:22,280
Among this group, you two are closest to death.

301
00:14:22,280 --> 00:14:24,140
What the hell are you saying

302
00:14:23,000 --> 00:14:24,140
We're like right there

303
00:14:24,140 --> 00:14:27,420
That's right. You guys already have one foot in the grave.

304
00:14:27,420 --> 00:14:33,350
And so, as you get older haven't you thought "The days are getting shorter!"

305
00:14:33,340 --> 00:14:34,190
It is fast!

306
00:14:34,190 --> 00:14:36,090
Isn't it?

307
00:14:34,560 --> 00:14:36,090
Definitely

308
00:14:36,100 --> 00:14:37,740
It flies by

309
00:14:37,800 --> 00:14:40,400
This is what the older generations say so

310
00:14:40,400 --> 00:14:43,820
this time what I have to present is this!

311
00:14:44,340 --> 00:14:48,220
Theory : The older you get the shorter a day feels

312
00:14:49,640 --> 00:14:51,520
This is totally the case

313
00:14:51,520 --> 00:14:53,520
That's hard to measure, isn't it?

314
00:14:53,520 --> 00:14:56,780
Exactly, that's why this time, in order to do so

315
00:14:56,780 --> 00:15:03,080
We had various entertainers go into prefab rooms, where they couldn't see outside...

316
00:15:03,080 --> 00:15:08,320
and asked them to come out in exactly 24 hours!

317
00:15:08,860 --> 00:15:11,120
Based on their own timing!

318
00:15:11,120 --> 00:15:13,390
Is that possible?

319
00:15:11,880 --> 00:15:13,390
With no signs of time.

320
00:15:13,390 --> 00:15:18,400
Like, "I think it's been around 24 hours..." is what...

321
00:15:18,400 --> 00:15:20,740
There's nothing, right?

322
00:15:19,020 --> 00:15:20,740
There's nothing.

323
00:15:20,740 --> 00:15:22,000
No windows.

324
00:15:22,000 --> 00:15:27,260
And when they come out, they should come out starting with the oldest....is the theory.

325
00:15:26,440 --> 00:15:27,260
I see

326
00:15:27,780 --> 00:15:33,600
The older you get, the shorter the days feel theory test commences.

327
00:15:34,900 --> 00:15:40,120
With that said, this time we have boxes where one cannot see outside.

328
00:15:41,540 --> 00:15:45,000
We'll have 4 entertainers, from different age groups, enter...

329
00:15:45,000 --> 00:15:50,630
and instruct them to come out when they think 24 hours have passed.

330
00:15:51,960 --> 00:15:58,100
If this theory holds true, they should come out starting with the oldest.

331
00:15:59,780 --> 00:16:05,000
The participants were non-busy entertainers whose schedules were open for 24 hours.

332
00:16:04,500 --> 00:16:06,240
Don't say "non-busy".

333
00:16:05,900 --> 00:16:07,440
First is...

334
00:16:09,120 --> 00:16:12,580
representing 20s, Zawachin.

335
00:16:09,700 --> 00:16:11,920
I didn't know.

336
00:16:13,240 --> 00:16:15,100
20s.

337
00:16:13,500 --> 00:16:15,940
Next, representing 60s, is...

338
00:16:18,580 --> 00:16:20,200
Lou Oshiba.

339
00:16:22,000 --> 00:16:26,330
And since our oldest participant is to be in their 80s...

340
00:16:22,720 --> 00:16:24,880
80s?

341
00:16:27,260 --> 00:16:31,640
and since many entertainers in their 80s are superstars...

342
00:16:29,600 --> 00:16:31,540
Yeah, that's true.

343
00:16:32,320 --> 00:16:34,660
We had this person come.

344
00:16:34,260 --> 00:16:36,040
Who?

345
00:16:37,480 --> 00:16:42,780
Assisted us in our 10x Quiz, extra, Yoshiyuki Yamada-san.

346
00:16:42,780 --> 00:16:44,640
This is also called a knee.

347
00:16:46,400 --> 00:16:51,020
Since the participant representing 40s was late...

348
00:16:49,480 --> 00:16:52,280
Where could he be?

349
00:16:52,260 --> 00:16:56,120
the three go ahead and standby in their rooms.

350
00:16:55,640 --> 00:16:59,460
What's with the 40 y/o being late?

351
00:16:57,460 --> 00:17:00,300
Aah~ I'm worried.

352
00:17:00,940 --> 00:17:02,820
What's up with that?

353
00:17:03,830 --> 00:17:06,840
First, I'm going to change.

354
00:17:03,840 --> 00:17:07,300
Oh they have a fridge.

355
00:17:05,280 --> 00:17:07,300
Yes, yes, it's furnished inside.

356
00:17:07,740 --> 00:17:13,200
Since tonight is just an observation of time. Bringing in personal items is allowed.

357
00:17:13,960 --> 00:17:19,260
Meals can also be eaten at any time they want.

358
00:17:19,060 --> 00:17:21,100
That makes sense.

359
00:17:21,220 --> 00:17:25,320
Coming in 10 minutes after the three.

360
00:17:24,880 --> 00:17:27,040
There he is.

361
00:17:25,920 --> 00:17:27,040
Really?

362
00:17:27,580 --> 00:17:29,240
So it's this guy.

363
00:17:30,480 --> 00:17:35,960
Turning 40 this year, Yasuda Dai Circus' Kuro-chan.

364
00:17:32,160 --> 00:17:34,160
There he is.

365
00:17:34,300 --> 00:17:36,880
He only appears on these things.

366
00:17:38,840 --> 00:17:43,460
As usual, only Kuro-chan isn't explained anything.

367
00:17:48,800 --> 00:17:51,280
Man, this guy's so easy.

368
00:17:52,820 --> 00:17:55,820
For real, so easy!

369
00:17:57,000 --> 00:18:03,100
With everyone gathered now. At 0:00AM the test starts.

370
00:17:58,560 --> 00:18:01,140
He's the easiest the get.

371
00:18:03,830 --> 00:18:08,300
So...now that it's started...

372
00:18:08,770 --> 00:18:11,940
because there's no clock...

373
00:18:11,940 --> 00:18:16,940
to gain an idea of what time it is...

374
00:18:16,940 --> 00:18:19,380
drawing a picture is good.

375
00:18:19,640 --> 00:18:22,380
Ahh~ what should I do~

376
00:18:22,380 --> 00:18:26,550
Not used to not having a phone.

377
00:18:23,760 --> 00:18:25,360
It's gotta be boring.

378
00:18:25,360 --> 00:18:27,300
Well, it would be boring.

379
00:18:27,300 --> 00:18:29,960
Right, no smartphone.

380
00:18:28,400 --> 00:18:30,500
No TV, either.

381
00:18:29,960 --> 00:18:32,240
Can't play with your phone.

382
00:18:32,660 --> 00:18:36,500
A ukiyo-e book.

383
00:18:33,780 --> 00:18:36,500
He went for his ukiyo-e book first.

384
00:18:36,760 --> 00:18:42,000
Since everyone brought in personal items, they start killing time, except...

385
00:18:43,400 --> 00:18:45,840
Kuro-chan, who knows nothing.

386
00:18:44,800 --> 00:18:47,520
Tell him!

387
00:18:45,740 --> 00:18:47,520
He doesn't even know if he can take off the mask.

388
00:18:48,310 --> 00:18:50,340
A room!

389
00:18:50,900 --> 00:18:53,480
Well, you're not wrong.

390
00:18:51,420 --> 00:18:53,480
Is there a simpler answer?

391
00:18:51,840 --> 00:18:53,480
Eh? What is this?

392
00:18:55,240 --> 00:18:57,340
He doesn't know anything.

393
00:18:55,450 --> 00:18:57,920
Rule?

394
00:18:58,040 --> 00:18:59,880
This is where finds out.

395
00:18:59,880 --> 00:19:03,800
Leave this room in exactly 24 hours.

396
00:19:05,200 --> 00:19:07,160
What do you mean? What do you mean?

397
00:19:07,220 --> 00:19:09,140
That would happen.

398
00:19:08,330 --> 00:19:11,830
What do you mean by "exactly"?

399
00:19:11,830 --> 00:19:13,760
I can't tell what time it is!

400
00:19:14,500 --> 00:19:17,400
Looks to be a little agitated...

401
00:19:17,740 --> 00:19:23,210
Are you testing how good a human's internal clock is?

402
00:19:23,340 --> 00:19:27,780
With his instincts, he roughly figures out the experiment.

403
00:19:26,280 --> 00:19:28,100
You catch on quick!

404
00:19:28,100 --> 00:19:30,840
He was looking directly into the camera.

405
00:19:29,740 --> 00:19:32,160
What's with this guy?

406
00:19:30,140 --> 00:19:34,500
It is now, 1:00AM. An hour since the start of the test.

407
00:19:32,180 --> 00:19:34,500
"Is that all?"

408
00:19:36,790 --> 00:19:39,420
Slee~py

409
00:19:39,420 --> 00:19:42,930
Probably 30 minutes have gone by.

410
00:19:42,930 --> 00:19:44,930
40 minutes, 30 minutes.

411
00:19:45,130 --> 00:19:47,160
Now, since the start...

412
00:19:48,800 --> 00:19:53,440
it feels like an hour or so has gone by. Lemme jot it down.

413
00:19:53,700 --> 00:19:57,010
I don't think it's been 2 hours yet.

414
00:19:57,010 --> 00:20:01,180
Maybe 1 hour has gone by though.

415
00:19:59,180 --> 00:20:01,380
You're not even looking at your ukiyo-e book.

416
00:20:05,150 --> 00:20:08,450
It's been about one hu-h

417
00:20:08,320 --> 00:20:10,080
One hour...

418
00:20:11,760 --> 00:20:13,460
Stop smacking your lips

419
00:20:12,960 --> 00:20:15,630
I think about one hour has passed,

420
00:20:15,890 --> 00:20:18,730
Let's make a mark.

421
00:20:19,280 --> 00:20:21,280
So that's how he's gonna do it

422
00:20:20,500 --> 00:20:25,100
So far, everyone is still accurate in their timing.

423
00:20:21,280 --> 00:20:23,740
Smart

424
00:20:25,960 --> 00:20:27,460
Still a long time left

425
00:20:27,420 --> 00:20:31,540
2 AM, 2 hours since the start

426
00:20:27,680 --> 00:20:29,000
True

427
00:20:29,020 --> 00:20:31,420
How will they tell time when they're sleeping?

428
00:20:33,210 --> 00:20:34,410
What time is it?

429
00:20:34,410 --> 00:20:36,680
I wanna play with my phone

430
00:20:36,400 --> 00:20:38,340
The struggles of youth

431
00:20:36,910 --> 00:20:42,490
maybe 2.5 - 3 hours have passed

432
00:20:43,120 --> 00:20:47,020
Well, it's time to turn in.

433
00:20:47,220 --> 00:20:49,200
Why are you drinking?

434
00:20:47,220 --> 00:20:53,460
Tomorrow I'll wake up at around 6 or 7 AM.

435
00:20:53,700 --> 00:20:57,570
Because my body is used to that right now.

436
00:20:57,560 --> 00:20:59,960
If he sticks to his usual routine

437
00:20:58,740 --> 00:21:02,220
Believing that his body knows when to wake up

438
00:21:01,140 --> 00:21:03,080
It'll be easy to tell

439
00:21:02,840 --> 00:21:05,180
Lou retires.

440
00:21:03,560 --> 00:21:05,100
Hmmm

441
00:21:05,080 --> 00:21:06,580
I see

442
00:21:05,180 --> 00:21:06,880
And then

443
00:21:10,020 --> 00:21:14,280
80 year old Yamada retires.

444
00:21:10,860 --> 00:21:12,480
Beer as well?

445
00:21:12,840 --> 00:21:15,140
Yeah, I'm a little worried.

446
00:21:15,680 --> 00:21:17,500
The way he put his hands...

447
00:21:18,090 --> 00:21:21,660
oh, double ones

448
00:21:20,260 --> 00:21:21,660
What the hell is he doing?

449
00:21:22,680 --> 00:21:25,660
Current time is 3 AM

450
00:21:27,670 --> 00:21:30,900
Everyone's probably asleep now.

451
00:21:31,170 --> 00:21:35,210
It's probably just me still up

452
00:21:37,340 --> 00:21:38,510
Is he dead?

453
00:21:38,540 --> 00:21:40,100
Dude there's a futon

454
00:21:44,480 --> 00:21:45,920
No, I didn't mean "ehh"

455
00:21:45,920 --> 00:21:47,850
I was dreaming

456
00:21:47,850 --> 00:21:48,820
I was dreaming just now

457
00:21:48,820 --> 00:21:51,220
Even though I wasn't sleeping

458
00:21:51,490 --> 00:21:54,080
Disgusting, sleep-talking

459
00:21:52,740 --> 00:21:54,080
That's scary

460
00:21:55,230 --> 00:21:59,260
If I sleep, I probably won't remember what time it is.

461
00:21:55,900 --> 00:21:57,300
Scary

462
00:22:00,220 --> 00:22:01,740
However...

463
00:22:03,520 --> 00:22:05,120
What a disgusting sound.

464
00:22:08,120 --> 00:22:09,820
This guy is filthy

465
00:22:10,520 --> 00:22:15,300
At 4:00, losing to his drowsiness, Kuro retires.

466
00:22:16,540 --> 00:22:19,320
Afterwards, Zawachin also retires.

467
00:22:37,760 --> 00:22:40,000
4 hours since the beginning

468
00:22:41,360 --> 00:22:46,860
Everyone has fallen asleep, but the clock still continues.

469
00:22:47,780 --> 00:22:50,460
The first to awaken is...

470
00:22:53,940 --> 00:22:55,580
Lou Ooshiba

471
00:22:57,720 --> 00:23:02,560
I think it's sometime between 8 and 9

472
00:23:01,600 --> 00:23:04,560
His internal clock is probably off after getting up

473
00:23:02,560 --> 00:23:05,800
Let's go with 8:30

474
00:23:06,500 --> 00:23:10,260
Lou currently thinks it's 8:30

475
00:23:11,680 --> 00:23:14,800
but it's actually only 6:00

476
00:23:14,760 --> 00:23:16,800
I see

477
00:23:16,140 --> 00:23:19,860
Here we have a substantial time difference.

478
00:23:22,080 --> 00:23:24,960
Our next contestant to wake up is...

479
00:23:29,780 --> 00:23:31,160
Zawachin

480
00:23:33,260 --> 00:23:36,700
It's maybe 12:00? Let's write that down.

481
00:23:37,460 --> 00:23:39,220
No way you slept that long

482
00:23:39,180 --> 00:23:42,240
But actually, it's still only 8:00

483
00:23:44,200 --> 00:23:49,000
Does the human internal clock misalign once we go to sleep?

484
00:23:50,380 --> 00:23:54,860
However, what about the most apprehensive Kuro

485
00:23:56,560 --> 00:23:58,520
What a weird way to get up

486
00:23:58,580 --> 00:24:00,620
9:00

487
00:24:00,620 --> 00:24:02,620
Maybe 9:30?

488
00:24:04,920 --> 00:24:08,700
Somehow, he got the time just right.

489
00:24:07,440 --> 00:24:09,040
Isn't that amazing?

490
00:24:09,040 --> 00:24:11,420
Only 2 minutes off!

491
00:24:09,840 --> 00:24:11,420
Hella correct!

492
00:24:11,920 --> 00:24:13,820
He's really taking it easy

493
00:24:13,820 --> 00:24:15,300
Isn't that bad?

494
00:24:15,820 --> 00:24:20,240
At this time, everyone passes time in their own way

495
00:24:16,340 --> 00:24:17,900
I'm getting a bit anxious

496
00:24:17,380 --> 00:24:18,820
Yeah same

497
00:24:21,620 --> 00:24:25,680
the 4 members waiting for the 24 hours to pass.

498
00:24:23,520 --> 00:24:25,240
Oh it's nice they have a TV

499
00:24:29,380 --> 00:24:31,360
What the hell is he doing?

500
00:24:30,480 --> 00:24:32,820
3-4-5

501
00:24:32,040 --> 00:24:35,000
What's so interesting about that?

502
00:24:34,760 --> 00:24:36,100
What's the principle here?

503
00:24:35,720 --> 00:24:37,320
4-4-5

504
00:24:37,040 --> 00:24:38,920
That's so scary

505
00:24:39,840 --> 00:24:41,080
This is bad

506
00:24:40,360 --> 00:24:42,040
Is he ok? still alive?

507
00:24:42,120 --> 00:24:45,320
The first person to come out is...

508
00:24:46,260 --> 00:24:48,040
Eh.. Someone's already out?

509
00:24:49,660 --> 00:24:51,140
Isn't he early?

510
00:24:51,100 --> 00:24:54,420
What? It's the 60's Lou Ooshiba

511
00:24:53,400 --> 00:24:55,280
Yeah he's early

512
00:24:56,220 --> 00:25:01,120
And with that, unfortunately, the theory has been proven false.

513
00:25:02,450 --> 00:25:05,520
I just thought that now would be a good time

514
00:25:05,880 --> 00:25:08,020
The resulting time is...

515
00:25:11,300 --> 00:25:12,700
2:00 PM?

516
00:25:15,280 --> 00:25:17,860
An amazing 9 hours short

517
00:25:18,800 --> 00:25:20,640
An amazing feat

518
00:25:19,660 --> 00:25:21,770
Am I first?

519
00:25:21,770 --> 00:25:23,530
I see

520
00:25:23,530 --> 00:25:27,240
I think my stubble was getting to a good point

521
00:25:28,170 --> 00:25:30,370
So I thought maybe 24 hours had passed.

522
00:25:30,370 --> 00:25:32,980
Oh my god right, yup

523
00:25:33,780 --> 00:25:35,200
Amazing

524
00:25:33,800 --> 00:25:36,200
And then, 10 minutes later.

525
00:25:39,520 --> 00:25:41,940
Who? Ah Zawachin

526
00:25:43,460 --> 00:25:47,000
What? Zawachin also leaves her room.

527
00:25:51,830 --> 00:25:54,530
15 hours?

528
00:25:53,260 --> 00:25:55,560
How unfortunate

529
00:25:55,000 --> 00:25:57,630
Only 15 hours have passed?

530
00:25:57,630 --> 00:25:59,400
That's scary

531
00:25:59,400 --> 00:26:01,610
really scary

532
00:26:01,610 --> 00:26:03,110
Wild

533
00:26:02,700 --> 00:26:03,980
I get that feeling

534
00:26:03,880 --> 00:26:07,080
Our remaining members are 40's representative Kuro

535
00:26:07,320 --> 00:26:09,400
1-2-3

536
00:26:11,020 --> 00:26:13,080
And 80's representative Yamada

537
00:26:12,320 --> 00:26:13,900
Is Yamada OK?

538
00:26:13,900 --> 00:26:15,660
He seriously might be dead

539
00:26:15,220 --> 00:26:20,220
Which will leave closer to 24 hours?

540
00:26:22,630 --> 00:26:25,730
Is this really about the internal clock?

541
00:26:25,730 --> 00:26:28,630
Is there something after this?

542
00:26:27,420 --> 00:26:29,500
Right, he doesn't know about this?

543
00:26:28,630 --> 00:26:32,270
After this is the main part?

544
00:26:31,500 --> 00:26:33,620
We've tricked him too much

545
00:26:32,220 --> 00:26:34,280
That's true

546
00:26:33,040 --> 00:26:35,310
They really won't answer me

547
00:26:36,100 --> 00:26:41,060
Kuro is anxious without knowing the full story

548
00:26:43,000 --> 00:26:44,680
Oh he's alive

549
00:26:45,900 --> 00:26:47,660
He sleeps alot

550
00:26:47,260 --> 00:26:51,980
Sleeping for 9 hours, Yamada gets up at 11:00 AM

551
00:26:53,460 --> 00:26:57,760
Passing time by tracing Ukiyo-e art

552
00:26:57,100 --> 00:26:59,600
That's a tasteful way to kill time

553
00:26:59,840 --> 00:27:04,280
And afterwards goes to sleep again

554
00:27:06,640 --> 00:27:08,210
I really don't get it

555
00:27:08,470 --> 00:27:11,140
What is this? Tell me!

556
00:27:11,140 --> 00:27:13,110
I have no info!

557
00:27:15,680 --> 00:27:17,560
How scary

558
00:27:18,100 --> 00:27:20,520
He's only had himself until now right

559
00:27:20,520 --> 00:27:22,920
No way he can laugh in that room

560
00:27:22,200 --> 00:27:26,120
Both parties continue to kill time...

561
00:27:27,180 --> 00:27:28,600
Then..

562
00:27:29,330 --> 00:27:31,600
Ok, goodbye, it has been exactly

563
00:27:31,600 --> 00:27:33,400
24 hours. I'm leaving in accordance to the rules!

564
00:27:33,400 --> 00:27:33,960
I'm leaving!

565
00:27:34,300 --> 00:27:36,420
I left!

566
00:27:36,540 --> 00:27:38,700
Shouldn't Yamada hear that?

567
00:27:37,580 --> 00:27:40,420
Kuro decides to leave first

568
00:27:38,860 --> 00:27:41,280
It's because he doesn't understand anything

569
00:27:41,720 --> 00:27:44,560
The resulting time is...

570
00:27:49,900 --> 00:27:51,260
Nicely done

571
00:27:50,980 --> 00:27:53,280
Does this mean I'm wrong?

572
00:27:54,100 --> 00:27:58,300
Without context, his reaction is pretty weak.

573
00:27:58,640 --> 00:28:02,940
With a error within 46 minutes, an amazing record

574
00:28:03,190 --> 00:28:04,290
Eh, what's going  on here?

575
00:28:04,290 --> 00:28:06,330
Like seriously what is this?

576
00:28:06,660 --> 00:28:08,270
We're finished here.

577
00:28:08,270 --> 00:28:10,070
No, I don't understand

578
00:28:10,070 --> 00:28:11,940
I really don't

579
00:28:12,520 --> 00:28:15,340
And finally, the last to come out

580
00:28:15,620 --> 00:28:17,680
I'm glad he's still alive

581
00:28:15,720 --> 00:28:17,960
80's representative, Yamada

582
00:28:17,700 --> 00:28:20,220
Wow that's amazing

583
00:28:20,580 --> 00:28:23,880
The resulting time is?

584
00:28:27,880 --> 00:28:29,850
35 hours?

585
00:28:30,740 --> 00:28:34,260
An incredible 11 hours over!

586
00:28:34,540 --> 00:28:36,430
Amazing

587
00:28:36,960 --> 00:28:39,260
You've gotta be kidding

588
00:28:39,760 --> 00:28:42,330
Wow...

589
00:28:39,900 --> 00:28:41,420
This is incredible

590
00:28:41,420 --> 00:28:43,120
The poor staff members

591
00:28:42,800 --> 00:28:45,600
I actually thought I was still early...

592
00:28:43,120 --> 00:28:45,120
Right...

593
00:28:46,160 --> 00:28:52,200
With that, it turns out that the speed at which a day passes has nothing to do with age.

594
00:28:53,640 --> 00:28:55,660
I see, they're unrelated...

595
00:28:56,360 --> 00:29:01,180
But the fact that Kuro had no information and was still the most accurate is amazing.

596
00:29:01,180 --> 00:29:02,100
Very true

597
00:29:02,100 --> 00:29:04,860
Kuro-chan's trust was just amazing

598
00:29:05,360 --> 00:29:08,220
But he's lost his trust in people

599
00:29:07,080 --> 00:29:08,220
Right

600
00:29:08,220 --> 00:29:11,180
The people who did that was "Wednesday Downtown" though

601
00:29:11,200 --> 00:29:12,480
That's true

602
00:29:12,480 --> 00:29:14,040
Mhmm

603
00:29:14,240 --> 00:29:17,720
I think Zawachin would have had a different result if she had her phone.

604
00:29:18,060 --> 00:29:23,820
I have the feeling that she would have been more accurate if she were playing with her phone.

605
00:29:23,820 --> 00:29:27,840
But a phone is essentially a clock so...

606
00:29:25,300 --> 00:29:27,840
That's true...

607
00:29:27,940 --> 00:29:30,840
What are you talking about

608
00:29:28,740 --> 00:29:30,840
Sorry, my bad

609
00:29:31,400 --> 00:29:33,400
Ah, wait, is there something in your ear?

610
00:29:33,400 --> 00:29:35,180
Ear monitor?

611
00:29:33,780 --> 00:29:35,180
Maybe from... Daikichi!

612
00:29:37,020 --> 00:29:38,820
She has some backup with her retorts

613
00:29:38,840 --> 00:29:41,420
That makes me a bit worried

614
00:29:43,300 --> 00:29:49,940
Moving on, we're introducing theories from around the world in "Everyone's Theory" corner.

615
00:29:49,940 --> 00:29:52,500
Tonight's presenter is...

616
00:29:54,520 --> 00:29:58,000
Koyabu Kazutoyo

617
00:29:56,500 --> 00:29:58,000
Thanks for having me

618
00:29:58,000 --> 00:29:59,380
Chairman

619
00:29:59,380 --> 00:30:00,200
Thanks

620
00:30:00,240 --> 00:30:04,090
The bags under your eyes are fricking crazy today

621
00:30:05,580 --> 00:30:08,060
I was free yesterday, that might be it

622
00:30:08,080 --> 00:30:10,030
I didn't do jack yesterday

623
00:30:10,030 --> 00:30:13,310
Let's move on to the theory I've brought for you today. Here it is!

624
00:30:14,330 --> 00:30:20,510
Theory: The people who wear giant sunglasses at night can't have a valid reason other than being a superstar

625
00:30:20,560 --> 00:30:23,000
Aw that's a bit...

626
00:30:23,260 --> 00:30:27,180
There are alot of normal people who do that

627
00:30:25,400 --> 00:30:27,180
Yes there are

628
00:30:27,630 --> 00:30:33,120
If it were midday, you'd have plenty of reasons like UV rays or protecting your eyes in general

629
00:30:33,120 --> 00:30:35,040
That I can get

630
00:30:35,040 --> 00:30:37,420
They're called SUN glasses

631
00:30:37,420 --> 00:30:39,230
They're for the SUN

632
00:30:39,230 --> 00:30:42,040
At night there's NO SUN

633
00:30:42,040 --> 00:30:45,630
Sunglasses at night feels a bit, you know...

634
00:30:45,630 --> 00:30:50,080
Superstars putting giant ones on to not get recognised, that I get as well, but...

635
00:30:50,080 --> 00:30:53,180
...when you're not even a superstar...

636
00:30:53,180 --> 00:30:55,950
...and the sun isn't even out...

637
00:30:55,950 --> 00:30:59,740
...wearing these giant, dark sunglasses...

638
00:30:59,740 --> 00:31:02,330
...why the hell are you walking around like that at night?!

639
00:31:02,890 --> 00:31:05,210
We thought there were people who thought this way...

640
00:31:05,210 --> 00:31:10,250
Motoki-san were there people wearing sunglasses at night at the baseball stadium?

641
00:31:10,250 --> 00:31:12,040
There aren't really no...

642
00:31:12,050 --> 00:31:15,190
There are people who put on paint under their eyes though...

643
00:31:15,180 --> 00:31:16,590
That's for a day game

644
00:31:16,590 --> 00:31:20,150
And that's also me right now too...

645
00:31:21,150 --> 00:31:24,890
After this, a search for sunglasses at night

646
00:31:26,440 --> 00:31:33,530
We're investigating the theory that The people who wear giant sunglasses at night can't have a valid reason other than being a superstar

647
00:31:34,300 --> 00:31:39,130
That means a search for sunglasses at night in the city

648
00:31:39,550 --> 00:31:41,480
And then...

649
00:31:40,520 --> 00:31:43,530
There definitely are some

650
00:31:43,920 --> 00:31:46,080
We've found someone...

651
00:31:46,080 --> 00:31:49,020
...who even has the vibe of a celebrity

652
00:31:49,870 --> 00:31:51,970
Sorry

653
00:31:51,970 --> 00:31:54,310
We're from TBS Television

654
00:31:54,310 --> 00:31:58,110
...this might be rude but are you in showbiz by any chance?

655
00:31:58,700 --> 00:32:01,200
Yes I am, got found out...

656
00:32:01,580 --> 00:32:05,630
Somehow, she actually was famous

657
00:32:05,630 --> 00:32:07,290
However...

658
00:32:07,630 --> 00:32:09,800
Are you a model?

659
00:32:10,160 --> 00:32:12,780
(Note : OL stands for office-lady, which basically means she does office work)

660
00:32:10,160 --> 00:32:13,680
I'm an OL*

661
00:32:11,160 --> 00:32:13,680
Oh you're an OL...

662
00:32:13,680 --> 00:32:15,850
It was just a joke...

663
00:32:15,950 --> 00:32:17,900
The hell is this girl!?

664
00:32:20,360 --> 00:32:23,500
You're wearing sunglasses even though it's night out so we thought you might be famous...

665
00:32:23,500 --> 00:32:27,130
Oh gawd I hate that. This was about me? Not him?

666
00:32:27,130 --> 00:32:28,640
That's like uh the worst

667
00:32:28,800 --> 00:32:31,840
By the way why are you wearing sunglasses?

668
00:32:31,840 --> 00:32:35,150
I haven't got makeup on

669
00:32:33,260 --> 00:32:35,150
To hide your no makeup face

670
00:32:36,120 --> 00:32:38,620
Next we have this person

671
00:32:39,500 --> 00:32:42,270
We thought you might be famous so...

672
00:32:42,270 --> 00:32:44,620
That's completely wrong though...

673
00:32:44,620 --> 00:32:49,200
By the way why are you wearing sunglasses even though it's night out?

674
00:32:49,400 --> 00:32:54,720
There's a rumour going around that if you see my eyes you get pregnant

675
00:32:55,400 --> 00:33:00,240
Theory : If you see my eyes, you'll get pregnant

676
00:32:57,550 --> 00:33:00,250
There's no reason to write that out!

677
00:33:00,400 --> 00:33:02,980
You're always wearing them?

678
00:33:01,290 --> 00:33:02,980
Always always yes...

679
00:33:02,980 --> 00:33:04,780
Even inside my house...

680
00:33:04,800 --> 00:33:07,210
...Since everybody'll get pregnant...

681
00:33:07,210 --> 00:33:08,750
...I can't take that responsibility

682
00:33:10,010 --> 00:33:13,680
It was new kind of dad joke

683
00:33:12,920 --> 00:33:14,810
It's for fashion right?

684
00:33:15,530 --> 00:33:17,320
Next...

685
00:33:18,440 --> 00:33:19,880
Are you in showbiz?

686
00:33:20,410 --> 00:33:23,200
No I'm not no...

687
00:33:23,310 --> 00:33:26,540
Why are you wearing sunglasses at night?

688
00:33:24,380 --> 00:33:27,050
This guy's funny as hell!

689
00:33:26,540 --> 00:33:31,420
Why I wonder? For my getup you know...

690
00:33:31,800 --> 00:33:34,370
It's a side-job right?

691
00:33:33,150 --> 00:33:34,370
Yep

692
00:33:34,730 --> 00:33:36,730
A side-job?

693
00:33:36,730 --> 00:33:38,730
I'm a host

694
00:33:39,720 --> 00:33:45,100
He was a host that's in a band during the day

695
00:33:45,740 --> 00:33:47,550
And also...

696
00:33:47,930 --> 00:33:50,200
We both have regular customers so...

697
00:33:50,200 --> 00:33:54,140
...if we're found out it'll affect our income

698
00:33:54,140 --> 00:33:56,280
And it's okay to put you on TV?

699
00:33:57,100 --> 00:34:01,660
After that, we talked with alot of people with sunglasses...

700
00:34:02,760 --> 00:34:08,220
...we couldn't even meet a cheap artist, let alone superstars

701
00:34:08,670 --> 00:34:11,980
However,

702
00:34:12,300 --> 00:34:15,650
Is it possible that you're in the entertainment business?

703
00:34:15,760 --> 00:34:18,300
I'm not, but am I not kinda though?

704
00:34:18,300 --> 00:34:19,920
I'm a rapper

705
00:34:19,930 --> 00:34:20,940
Your name?

706
00:34:20,940 --> 00:34:24,860
I go by "Chanmina"

707
00:34:26,000 --> 00:34:30,590
Actually this lady, was part of a show that Koyabu was the MC of...

708
00:34:35,770 --> 00:34:38,650
She started out as a high-school rapper...

709
00:34:38,650 --> 00:34:42,530
...she's known with the youngsters

710
00:34:47,130 --> 00:34:49,820
Why are you wearing sunglasses at night?

711
00:34:49,820 --> 00:34:52,300
I get secretly filmed alot like...

712
00:34:52,300 --> 00:34:54,250
..."Chanmina was there" and stuff

713
00:34:54,250 --> 00:34:57,050
There was a time where my eyes looked really ugly

714
00:34:57,050 --> 00:35:00,010
It's because of that, yeah

715
00:35:01,040 --> 00:35:05,020
It wasn't about fans recognizing her and being annoying

716
00:35:05,230 --> 00:35:09,720
It's about not being filmed ugly

717
00:35:11,400 --> 00:35:14,200
Also, this woman too

718
00:35:14,350 --> 00:35:16,680
I rap, yeah

719
00:35:17,420 --> 00:35:20,840
It was Fuziko-san,

720
00:35:20,840 --> 00:35:22,840
from a group called "S7ick chicks" (Slick Chicks)

721
00:35:23,290 --> 00:35:26,490
I have work with an entertainer tomorrow

722
00:35:26,490 --> 00:35:28,840
It's dissing an entertainer

723
00:35:29,500 --> 00:35:35,500
Female rappers all wear sunglasses at night, we got that but...

724
00:35:36,160 --> 00:35:40,400
We haven't met a single superstar

725
00:35:40,860 --> 00:35:42,750
It's TBS TV but...

726
00:35:42,750 --> 00:35:44,540
Are you an entertainer?

727
00:35:44,730 --> 00:35:47,370
Uhm, why? Am I?

728
00:35:47,370 --> 00:35:49,610
You're not in showbiz?

729
00:35:49,840 --> 00:35:51,660
I'm not an entertainer

730
00:35:51,660 --> 00:35:55,110
What's the instrument inside the box?

731
00:35:53,450 --> 00:35:55,110
It's a tenor saxophone

732
00:35:55,240 --> 00:35:57,650
So you're a sax player

733
00:35:56,620 --> 00:35:57,650
Yeah I am

734
00:35:57,840 --> 00:36:00,640
Have you put out any CDs or something similar?

735
00:35:59,020 --> 00:36:00,640
Of course

736
00:36:00,640 --> 00:36:02,280
How many was it?

737
00:36:02,280 --> 00:36:06,990
About 14 of them

738
00:36:05,550 --> 00:36:06,990
I'm very sorry for my rudeness

739
00:36:07,180 --> 00:36:12,430
Actually, this person was given the "Japan Jazz Award"...

740
00:36:12,430 --> 00:36:16,080
...The tenor sax player Imazu Masato

741
00:36:17,080 --> 00:36:21,910
So you were kind of a superstar in the Jazz world?

742
00:36:19,230 --> 00:36:21,910
No, that's a long time ago though

743
00:36:21,910 --> 00:36:24,520
It was 1989

744
00:36:25,480 --> 00:36:27,450
After that,

745
00:36:27,610 --> 00:36:29,920
We're from TBS TV but,

746
00:36:29,920 --> 00:36:33,530
Is it possible that you're in entertainment?

747
00:36:31,880 --> 00:36:33,530
Oh me?

748
00:36:33,530 --> 00:36:37,690
I'm not really in the industry, but I do "entertain"

749
00:36:38,640 --> 00:36:42,300
This is a Saijou Hideki impersonator...

750
00:36:42,300 --> 00:36:44,540
...called Vermont Hideki

751
00:36:44,640 --> 00:36:48,380
Here I have make up but, uhm...

752
00:36:48,380 --> 00:36:52,560
*Note : Kanpeki means perfect

753
00:36:48,380 --> 00:36:52,560
...it's like "Hideki Kanpekii*"

754
00:36:52,650 --> 00:36:53,820
Did that just fail?

755
00:36:53,820 --> 00:36:56,040
If that gag has failed, I go...

756
00:36:56,040 --> 00:36:59,840
*Note : Sangeki - Fail/Tragedy

757
00:36:56,040 --> 00:36:59,840
..."Hideki Sangekii*"

758
00:37:00,730 --> 00:37:02,880
If I'm being called to try more I do...

759
00:37:03,560 --> 00:37:08,110
He turns his switch on really quickly

760
00:37:06,320 --> 00:37:08,110
You don't have to say "sudden"

761
00:37:09,100 --> 00:37:12,410
And the next person we've approached is...

762
00:37:13,500 --> 00:37:16,970
This woman wearing the biggest sunglasses we've encountered today

763
00:37:17,660 --> 00:37:20,620
Are you in showbiz?

764
00:37:19,020 --> 00:37:20,620
Yes I am

765
00:37:20,620 --> 00:37:22,430
Your name?

766
00:37:21,200 --> 00:37:22,430
Vanilla

767
00:37:22,430 --> 00:37:26,460
I'm a plastic surgery model

768
00:37:27,960 --> 00:37:31,200
This investigation has shown that,

769
00:37:31,200 --> 00:37:34,920
Actually alot of entertainers appear to wear sunglasses at night

770
00:37:35,950 --> 00:37:38,350
And even within those...

771
00:37:39,440 --> 00:37:41,260
Excuse me

772
00:37:41,260 --> 00:37:44,560
We're from TBS TV but...

773
00:37:43,560 --> 00:37:44,560
Okay

774
00:37:44,560 --> 00:37:46,890
...is it possible that you're a famous person?

775
00:37:46,890 --> 00:37:49,930
No that's not true, you're not from TBS are you?

776
00:37:48,590 --> 00:37:49,930
No no no

777
00:37:49,960 --> 00:37:53,720
No way you're from TBS

778
00:37:51,340 --> 00:37:53,720
Um, it's TBS TV

779
00:37:53,720 --> 00:37:54,870
What are you doing here??

780
00:37:57,240 --> 00:37:59,150
I'm scared...

781
00:37:59,150 --> 00:38:01,050
We're asking people wearing sunglasses at night if-

782
00:38:01,050 --> 00:38:03,500
I'm not in entertainment as per se...

783
00:38:03,500 --> 00:38:06,890
But I do do theater on stage

784
00:38:06,890 --> 00:38:08,970
Since I'm a singer

785
00:38:08,970 --> 00:38:10,410
I sing songs yeah

786
00:38:10,410 --> 00:38:12,170
You're not in the entertainment business but

787
00:38:12,170 --> 00:38:14,510
I'm not darling no, I'm an artist

788
00:38:14,510 --> 00:38:16,590
A-HHAHA oh ho

789
00:38:15,850 --> 00:38:17,070
Cuz' that's different, isn't it?

790
00:38:18,010 --> 00:38:22,250
She was not a beekeeper, but a singer

791
00:38:22,250 --> 00:38:24,750
Nobody said anything about a beekeeper though

792
00:38:27,960 --> 00:38:31,000
She was really giving off a star-vibe but

793
00:38:31,000 --> 00:38:35,150
Have we met a real superstar?

794
00:38:35,340 --> 00:38:37,180
Darling is this...

795
00:38:37,180 --> 00:38:39,850
Darling this isn't filming now is it?

796
00:38:39,850 --> 00:38:43,920
That's no good, I'm, you know, on...

797
00:38:43,920 --> 00:38:46,810
...I do work with Yamamoto Linda and others so...

798
00:38:46,810 --> 00:38:49,900
...I can't have my face shown

799
00:38:50,510 --> 00:38:54,560
However, it was OK to put it in a brochure...

800
00:38:54,560 --> 00:38:57,230
...for publicity for an upcoming concert

801
00:38:57,230 --> 00:38:58,840
Stop that

802
00:38:57,850 --> 00:38:58,830
Like this..

803
00:38:59,600 --> 00:39:02,430
...We've seen it somewhere before zamasu.

804
00:39:02,910 --> 00:39:05,260
The person who said "Zamasu" right..

805
00:39:04,360 --> 00:39:05,420
Right?

806
00:39:06,640 --> 00:39:11,580
By the way this lady is a chanson singer called Shimazu Tomoko

807
00:39:11,580 --> 00:39:14,670
A genuine singer

808
00:39:14,860 --> 00:39:16,890
Come over to the Mitsukoshi Theater, darling,

809
00:39:16,890 --> 00:39:18,490
On the 18th

810
00:39:18,510 --> 00:39:21,370
Uh ha ha ha - I'm completely not though...

811
00:39:21,370 --> 00:39:23,240
By the way, usually

812
00:39:23,240 --> 00:39:27,420
Do you use the word "zamasu"?

813
00:39:25,770 --> 00:39:27,420
I do say "zamasu" yes

814
00:39:30,480 --> 00:39:32,670
But if my husband saw-

815
00:39:33,320 --> 00:39:38,350
With that, We found a "New zamasu" unexpectedly

816
00:39:38,960 --> 00:39:41,390
Where the hell did we land at?

817
00:39:41,520 --> 00:39:43,960
It's completely wrong

818
00:39:42,280 --> 00:39:43,960
What happened here?

819
00:39:44,160 --> 00:39:46,600
The worst thing about this show

820
00:39:47,020 --> 00:39:50,960
You're looking for sunglasses at the start

821
00:39:50,960 --> 00:39:52,160
And in the end you've found new "zamasu"

822
00:39:52,160 --> 00:39:54,910
Why the hell would I care about that?!

823
00:39:54,910 --> 00:39:56,300
Cut that out!

824
00:39:57,050 --> 00:40:02,040
Isn't this a little too full of itself?

825
00:39:59,290 --> 00:40:02,040
Too full?

826
00:40:02,120 --> 00:40:04,550
Even in stores,

827
00:40:04,550 --> 00:40:08,150
Placing the name of the owner as the store name

828
00:40:08,150 --> 00:40:11,290
the owner will most likely be too full of themselves

829
00:40:11,290 --> 00:40:12,450
Yeah,that does happen

830
00:40:12,450 --> 00:40:17,560
The expression that they get too full of themselves is a bit

831
00:40:16,310 --> 00:40:18,180
Cheerful and jovial types too

832
00:40:17,560 --> 00:40:22,110
Those that come forward

833
00:40:18,170 --> 00:40:22,110
Unexpectedly are my hated types

834
00:40:24,100 --> 00:40:29,080
Continuing this, I would like to present my theory. \nThis time the theory I brought is:

835
00:40:29,080 --> 00:40:33,960
Theory : 'In Japanese buildings, the number '4' is overly cared for'

836
00:40:35,780 --> 00:40:39,740
How about it? Isn't it time for someone to call upon this?

837
00:40:39,740 --> 00:40:42,370
Uwahh, its the number '4'

838
00:40:42,370 --> 00:40:44,510
Like house numbers

839
00:40:43,280 --> 00:40:44,510
Right

840
00:40:44,510 --> 00:40:47,630
Room numbers like '444'

841
00:40:47,630 --> 00:40:51,120
Sometimes room numbers like '104' are missing in Japanese condos

842
00:40:51,120 --> 00:40:53,930
That does exist

843
00:40:51,820 --> 00:40:53,930
But for baseball players, '4' might be given to a player

844
00:40:53,930 --> 00:40:55,660
'4' might be given to a player

845
00:40:55,660 --> 00:41:00,540
But the number '42' is hated by everyone

846
00:40:58,210 --> 00:41:00,540
42 = 死に (Death)

847
00:41:00,530 --> 00:41:03,790
But there are foreigners as well

848
00:41:01,960 --> 00:41:03,790
Well, for foreigners

849
00:41:03,790 --> 00:41:08,020
Jacky Robinson took the number '42'

850
00:41:08,020 --> 00:41:10,510
and wore the same jacket

851
00:41:08,680 --> 00:41:10,510
Where everyone took on the same jersey

852
00:41:10,510 --> 00:41:13,150
as Jacky Robinson such cases do exist

853
00:41:13,150 --> 00:41:14,510
Itou-san, what are your thoughts about '4'?

854
00:41:14,510 --> 00:41:17,000
I like the number '4' the most

855
00:41:17,000 --> 00:41:20,310
the number?

856
00:41:17,530 --> 00:41:20,310
Whereas on the other hand, everyone else

857
00:41:20,310 --> 00:41:26,180
kinda of hated it, therefore wanting to be unique, I liked the number '4'

858
00:41:25,310 --> 00:41:26,180
Intentionally

859
00:41:26,180 --> 00:41:30,320
Uwah, here comes death, Don't you consider that?

860
00:41:28,110 --> 00:41:30,320
I think of it as shiawase(Happiness) Shi ('4') in that case

861
00:41:30,300 --> 00:41:32,470
Ehhh,1,2,3

862
00:41:32,470 --> 00:41:34,800
'4'

863
00:41:35,720 --> 00:41:37,180
She's really fourth

864
00:41:37,180 --> 00:41:39,110
Great luck

865
00:41:39,110 --> 00:41:41,300
Great luck

866
00:41:39,580 --> 00:41:41,300
is that right?

867
00:41:42,270 --> 00:41:47,720
'In Japanese buildings, the number '4' is overly cared for' Theory

868
00:41:48,350 --> 00:41:53,390
Lets begin with hospitals which detest the imagery of death

869
00:41:54,050 --> 00:41:58,400
At this Aichi Medical University Hospital

870
00:41:59,060 --> 00:42:01,480
Fourth level's 42

871
00:42:01,480 --> 00:42:04,900
Cutting out only the '42' room

872
00:42:05,260 --> 00:42:08,040
The connotation of '42' and death

873
00:42:08,040 --> 00:42:11,270
is what we are trying to actively avoid

874
00:42:11,690 --> 00:42:17,480
It's a common occurrence in hospitals to remove the room '42'

875
00:42:18,110 --> 00:42:20,770
However at Hitachi Medical Center,

876
00:42:20,770 --> 00:42:27,620
We go by 401,402,403,skipping 404 , next is 405

877
00:42:27,620 --> 00:42:31,350
For entire floors,the room number '4' does not appear

878
00:42:31,350 --> 00:42:32,540
Furthermore,

879
00:42:33,270 --> 00:42:38,880
Even in the medical examination rooms,the number '4' is avoided

880
00:42:39,580 --> 00:42:43,890
Inspection rooms too are removed from the number '4'

881
00:42:43,890 --> 00:42:49,110
X-rays rooms too are distanced away from '4'

882
00:42:46,800 --> 00:42:50,830
Wow, they really thoroughly removed '4's

883
00:42:50,620 --> 00:42:53,980
Changing rooms which are unrelated are also not spared too

884
00:42:53,980 --> 00:42:57,340
'4' has been purged

885
00:42:56,510 --> 00:43:01,560
Wow, that's a really complete deletion of '4'

886
00:42:57,810 --> 00:43:02,140
That was a hospital which was thoroughly aware and considerate of  the effects of '4'

887
00:43:02,880 --> 00:43:08,500
Next up, at the kisshoCAREN Inn
'4' too is something they are overly concerned with

888
00:43:09,530 --> 00:43:13,980
Rooms ending with '4' are disposed of without a doubt

889
00:43:15,570 --> 00:43:17,210
The entire 4th floor

890
00:43:17,210 --> 00:43:21,010
has been removed from the plane of existence

891
00:43:19,450 --> 00:43:22,850
Was there supposed to have a 4th floor?

892
00:43:21,710 --> 00:43:26,660
Even in the elevator, the number '4' is missing

893
00:43:26,660 --> 00:43:31,200
The floor number right after 3 is not '4' but 5

894
00:43:31,270 --> 00:43:36,890
Even in the employee only elevator and locker room
there is no number '4'

895
00:43:36,890 --> 00:43:42,000
In the entire building, there is no trace left of '4'

896
00:43:39,760 --> 00:43:45,010
When they overdo it like this, it brings attention to the fact, there is no '4' around

897
00:43:42,000 --> 00:43:46,600
An Inn which is totally frightened by the numeric '4'

898
00:43:46,600 --> 00:43:49,030
Following that, In miyako-jima

899
00:43:49,030 --> 00:43:54,520
A condo which is overly concerned with '4'

900
00:43:54,520 --> 00:43:56,360
5th floor over here we call it 5th floor instead

901
00:43:56,360 --> 00:43:57,820
Doors closing

902
00:43:57,820 --> 00:43:59,370
There is only 5

903
00:43:59,370 --> 00:44:01,940
Yeah there is only 5th floor

904
00:44:00,430 --> 00:44:01,940
Announcer: This is the 4th floor

905
00:44:01,940 --> 00:44:04,400
Wait up, wait up, one moment please

906
00:44:04,400 --> 00:44:08,340
On top the number is displayed as '4' but below
where the buttons are displayed, it is '5' instead

907
00:44:08,340 --> 00:44:11,490
He has pressed the 5th floor but,

908
00:44:11,490 --> 00:44:14,240
Announcer: This is the 4th floor

909
00:44:14,240 --> 00:44:17,470
The announcer is saying that it is the 4th floor

910
00:44:20,840 --> 00:44:24,600
ending in a nonsensical mess

911
00:44:23,320 --> 00:44:26,510
so which is which?

912
00:44:24,300 --> 00:44:26,510
The person might think not yet and not get off the lift

913
00:44:24,600 --> 00:44:26,400
For example

914
00:44:26,400 --> 00:44:28,960
here's the key to 503 and hands it off to them

915
00:44:28,960 --> 00:44:32,670
And when they go up, they will definitely hear that this is the 4th floor from the announcer

916
00:44:32,670 --> 00:44:36,550
Then where exactly is the 5th floor?Above this?

917
00:44:36,550 --> 00:44:39,720
Over here, we have more upper levels

918
00:44:39,720 --> 00:44:43,280
The announcer says [This is the 5th floor]

919
00:44:41,320 --> 00:44:44,280
Confusing

920
00:44:42,450 --> 00:44:44,260
Overly complicated

921
00:44:44,700 --> 00:44:50,480
Due to budget constraints, we were only able to do it to that extent

922
00:44:50,480 --> 00:44:52,850
On to Car plate numbers

923
00:44:52,850 --> 00:44:57,290
Taking into consideration of the whole nation

924
00:44:57,290 --> 00:45:00,210
As long as you don't deliberately apply

925
00:45:00,210 --> 00:45:04,240
The above two numbers will not be chosen for your carplate number

926
00:45:04,240 --> 00:45:07,460
This has already been decided by the Ministry of Land, Infrastructure and transport

927
00:45:05,060 --> 00:45:08,440
Just because of the connection to the number 4

928
00:45:07,460 --> 00:45:10,270
Even when we take a look overseas

929
00:45:10,270 --> 00:45:12,980
China similar to Japan, the number 4 sounds exactly the same as the character death

930
00:45:12,980 --> 00:45:17,810
Having the same pronunciation in China, the number '4' is also shunned upon

931
00:45:17,810 --> 00:45:23,530
In this Chinese style Las Vegas hotel,

932
00:45:23,530 --> 00:45:29,500
The floors 40 ~ 49 are gone

933
00:45:29,500 --> 00:45:34,830
Whereas in the west, '13' is considered to be unlucky and eschewed

934
00:45:34,830 --> 00:45:41,720
Similarly the practice of omission of '4' inauspicious digits in Japan, the number 13 is avoided in certain buildings

935
00:45:41,720 --> 00:45:45,290
Up to now, we have shown many places in Japan which put up great efforts to escape '4'

936
00:45:45,290 --> 00:45:46,560
However..

937
00:45:46,550 --> 00:45:51,570
There exist certain industries which purposely utilise '4'

938
00:45:59,740 --> 00:46:04,710
I can understand the sentiments behind preserving this part of Japanese heritage too but..

939
00:46:04,710 --> 00:46:07,920
Don't you think we have been going overboard?

940
00:46:11,910 --> 00:46:16,420
There exist certain industries which purposely utilise '4'

941
00:46:16,420 --> 00:46:19,630
and They are Funeral services companies

942
00:46:19,630 --> 00:46:24,760
Centrally located in the Chiba prefecture, 54 funeral services owned by this certain company

943
00:46:24,760 --> 00:46:30,450
Their telephone numbers all end with '4444'

944
00:46:27,640 --> 00:46:30,870
We can easily imagine the number '4' with the kanji 死

945
00:46:30,450 --> 00:46:35,910
Furthermore, the pioneer of this '4444' trend is

946
00:46:35,910 --> 00:46:40,960
Continuing the trade since Edo period, this 8th generation funeral service company president

947
00:46:40,960 --> 00:46:44,780
Simply put, its the most efficient way to invoke connections with death

948
00:46:44,780 --> 00:46:50,140
In morgues which don't have telephone directories, to make it easy for people to look up, '4444' was used

949
00:46:50,140 --> 00:46:53,080
Since I was small, I helped out my family business and eventually inherited it

950
00:46:53,080 --> 00:46:57,350
There is really no interesting tidbit or story behind it

951
00:46:57,350 --> 00:47:01,970
just a way of how to win over our competitors and get our pay from their inheritance tax

952
00:47:01,960 --> 00:47:08,900
There exists funeral services ending with 4242 extension as well

953
00:47:08,920 --> 00:47:10,350
Is that so...

954
00:47:10,350 --> 00:47:13,730
Those are indeed the points to be taken into consideration

955
00:47:13,730 --> 00:47:17,030
When you think about the phrase 'shi ni', isn't it weird?

956
00:47:17,030 --> 00:47:19,610
I can understand their apprehension if it is 'shi nu' (To die)

957
00:47:19,610 --> 00:47:23,260
Isn't 'shi ni' just half-hearted in terms of expression? (To death)

958
00:47:23,260 --> 00:47:24,140
So how do y'all feel?

959
00:47:24,140 --> 00:47:27,860
Kind of like shinimasen (Won't die)

960
00:47:25,280 --> 00:47:27,860
Indeed now that you pointed it out

961
00:47:27,860 --> 00:47:54,850
Check out our Facebook and Website for more Wednesday Downtown! This video was subbed by a community run project called the Wednesday Downtown project. Thanks for watching!

963
00:47:28,380 --> 00:47:31,130
In our next episode we attempt the bunt homerun

964
00:47:31,130 --> 00:47:35,420
Against a pitching machine at 300km/h

965
00:47:35,420 --> 00:47:39,620
Theory :'On SNS, the one determined to be cuter is the one who uses it as the profile picture'

966
00:47:39,620 --> 00:47:41,490
To show the best version of myself

967
00:47:41,490 --> 00:47:43,270
Slowly drawing the details

968
00:47:41,880 --> 00:47:43,270
Furthermore

969
00:47:43,270 --> 00:47:46,290
Can you play the telephone game using different genres?

970
00:47:46,290 --> 00:47:48,620
We have a quiz for Nagano on Christian Riese Lassen

971
00:47:48,620 --> 00:47:50,340
I have memories of seeing this piece of art before

972
00:47:50,340 --> 00:47:54,580
Who best understands their working tool?

973
00:47:53,320 --> 00:47:54,580
This is my best partner
