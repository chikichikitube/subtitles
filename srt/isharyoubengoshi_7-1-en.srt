1
00:00:02,030 --> 00:00:03,740
I feel it...

2
00:00:04,630 --> 00:00:09,920
An evil spirit is approaching,
filled with anger.

3
00:00:09,920 --> 00:00:11,620
An evil spirit?

4
00:00:10,520 --> 00:00:13,930
Hakamada's assistant:
Nonomura Kanae

5
00:00:11,620 --> 00:00:13,250
What is that?

6
00:00:21,020 --> 00:00:23,730
What? Are you talking about Misato-san?

7
00:00:21,430 --> 00:00:25,000
Editor at Tokiwa Publishing:
Tabata Misato

8
00:00:24,460 --> 00:00:26,770
Kanae-san, sorry I'm late.

9
00:00:26,770 --> 00:00:29,970
She's not angry at all.

10
00:00:29,970 --> 00:00:32,810
Cafe waitress:
Mizutani Sara

11
00:00:29,970 --> 00:00:32,810
No, I am never wrong.

12
00:00:32,810 --> 00:00:35,850
As far as I know, you've always
gotten our orders wrong.

13
00:00:36,850 --> 00:00:40,120
I brought someone who wants
to meet you, Kanae-san.

14
00:00:40,120 --> 00:00:41,420
Oh? Who's that?

15
00:00:41,420 --> 00:00:45,750
She's chief editor of our company's
restauranteur magazine, Gourmet-Goo...

16
00:00:45,750 --> 00:00:47,810
My name is Yukawa Natsuko.

17
00:00:45,820 --> 00:00:48,590
This episode's client:
Yukawa Natsuko

18
00:00:47,810 --> 00:00:50,840
She's the one filled with anger...

19
00:00:50,840 --> 00:00:51,220
What?

20
00:00:51,220 --> 00:00:53,600
Are you Nonomura-sensei,
the manga illustrator?

21
00:00:53,600 --> 00:00:54,470
Yes...

22
00:00:54,470 --> 00:00:56,330
What can I do for you?

23
00:00:56,330 --> 00:01:00,360
I want to meet the actual protagonist
of the manga, the lawyer.

24
00:01:00,360 --> 00:01:01,370
What?

25
00:01:01,910 --> 00:01:03,840
Hakamada Law Office

26
00:01:02,450 --> 00:01:06,740
I'm chief editor of Tokiwa publishing's
Gourmet-Goo, Yukawa Natsuko.

27
00:01:06,740 --> 00:01:08,230
I'm Hakamada, attorney at law.

28
00:01:06,740 --> 00:01:09,350
Attorney:
Hakamada Yukio

29
00:01:08,230 --> 00:01:09,350
Please come in.

30
00:01:09,350 --> 00:01:12,130
I'm an avid reader of
Nonomura-sensei's manga.

31
00:01:12,130 --> 00:01:15,200
I'm always impressed by
the gallant way the lawyer

32
00:01:15,200 --> 00:01:17,350
sues for compensation, so this
time, I want a consultation.

33
00:01:17,350 --> 00:01:21,990
Sensei is only a model
for that protagonist.

34
00:01:21,990 --> 00:01:24,290
So, what can I do for you?

35
00:01:26,900 --> 00:01:29,010
I want to report them.

36
00:01:28,600 --> 00:01:30,900
Number one in matchmaking

37
00:01:29,010 --> 00:01:30,610
"Get-Marriage"?

38
00:01:30,610 --> 00:01:32,060
It's a marriage consultation firm.

39
00:01:32,060 --> 00:01:36,340
I'm a registered in the 40,000 yen
per month premium member course.

40
00:01:36,340 --> 00:01:38,240
40,000? Expensive.

41
00:01:36,340 --> 00:01:38,610
Temp:
Shinozuka Rina

42
00:01:38,240 --> 00:01:39,980
It's been ten months since I enrolled.

43
00:01:39,980 --> 00:01:43,550
At the end of every week, Get-Marriage
hosts a marriage interview party.

44
00:01:43,550 --> 00:01:45,390
I've attended every one,

45
00:01:45,390 --> 00:01:47,180
and have had over fifty
interviews with potential partners.

46
00:01:47,180 --> 00:01:48,520
Fifty times?

47
00:01:48,520 --> 00:01:52,020
But, I haven't found a single
marriage prospect yet!

48
00:01:53,280 --> 00:01:54,420
I see...

49
00:01:54,420 --> 00:01:58,720
I have never neglected
my womanly endeavors.

50
00:01:58,720 --> 00:02:01,170
I'm conscientious about
beauty and fashion,

51
00:02:01,170 --> 00:02:04,500
my income is higher than men of my age,

52
00:02:04,500 --> 00:02:07,050
and yet I can't find a man to marry.

53
00:02:07,050 --> 00:02:09,300
That's because this marriage
consultation firm is incompetent!

54
00:02:12,710 --> 00:02:14,340
Therefore...

55
00:02:14,340 --> 00:02:17,790
I want to sue them for all
membership dues I've paid,

56
00:02:17,790 --> 00:02:19,350
and for compensation.

57
00:02:19,350 --> 00:02:21,850
That's just a minor complaint—

58
00:02:24,360 --> 00:02:27,320
Do you have the
membership contract form?

59
00:02:27,320 --> 00:02:28,240
Yes.

60
00:02:29,380 --> 00:02:30,720
Right here.

61
00:02:29,920 --> 00:02:32,990
Membership Contract Form

62
00:02:37,350 --> 00:02:40,270
Based on what I see here,
we might have difficulty.

63
00:02:40,270 --> 00:02:41,740
Why is that?

64
00:02:41,740 --> 00:02:45,080
It says here in the clause that
there will be no refund in the event

65
00:02:45,080 --> 00:02:48,340
a marriage partner is not found.

66
00:02:48,340 --> 00:02:49,940
We don't have a claim to make.

67
00:02:50,560 --> 00:02:52,000
Claim?

68
00:02:52,000 --> 00:02:55,070
Are you saying I'm just making a claim?

69
00:02:55,070 --> 00:02:57,250
Well, no...

70
00:02:57,250 --> 00:02:59,600
Sensei, you're no different from them.

71
00:02:59,600 --> 00:03:00,910
Huh?

72
00:03:00,910 --> 00:03:05,340
I spoke to the representative of
Get-Marriage concerning my situation.

73
00:03:05,340 --> 00:03:08,170
This is not the fault of our services.

74
00:03:06,960 --> 00:03:09,830
Get-Marriage representative:
Ozaki Masashi

75
00:03:09,490 --> 00:03:11,570
But, if you want to lay blame...

76
00:03:14,650 --> 00:03:19,440
Sensei, you're also saying it's my fault
that I can't find a partner, right?

77
00:03:19,440 --> 00:03:21,270
Um... Not at all.

78
00:03:21,270 --> 00:03:26,400
I want to meet a man, fall
in love, and get married.

79
00:03:26,400 --> 00:03:29,750
But I'm no beauty, so my
chances are slim.

80
00:03:29,750 --> 00:03:32,550
I have no choice but to rely on
a marriage consultation firm.

81
00:03:33,190 --> 00:03:36,080
But, those people take
advantage of our weaknesses,

82
00:03:36,080 --> 00:03:38,070
and rake in membership fees.

83
00:03:38,070 --> 00:03:39,730
Well, yes, um...

84
00:03:39,730 --> 00:03:40,590
Sensei.

85
00:03:40,590 --> 00:03:43,130
Let's take on this case.

86
00:03:45,500 --> 00:03:47,330
Kurumi-san. When did you get here?

87
00:03:47,330 --> 00:03:50,820
A marriage consultation firm
like this ought to be punished.

88
00:03:50,820 --> 00:03:52,410
Who are you?

89
00:03:52,410 --> 00:03:55,520
I am a freelance investigator,
Umemoto Kurumi.

90
00:03:56,870 --> 00:04:00,310
Freelance investigator:
Umemoto Kurumi

91
00:03:57,180 --> 00:04:00,680
I will accept your request to
investigate, for a discounted fee.

92
00:04:00,680 --> 00:04:02,250
Thank you!

93
00:04:02,690 --> 00:04:06,650
However, seeing as they
do have this clause...

94
00:04:07,680 --> 00:04:09,150
This case will be difficult.

95
00:04:09,150 --> 00:04:12,730
We would have to prove that the
marriage consultation firm

96
00:04:12,730 --> 00:04:15,810
is purposefully preventing
you from finding a partner.

97
00:04:15,810 --> 00:04:18,090
Which means what?

98
00:04:18,090 --> 00:04:20,770
That their scheme is to keep
billing for membership

99
00:04:21,200 --> 00:04:24,290
while setting up its members
with mismatched partners.

100
00:04:24,290 --> 00:04:27,870
Or, perhaps the matched
partners are hired fakes.

101
00:04:27,870 --> 00:04:31,090
I can easily find evidence.

102
00:04:31,090 --> 00:04:33,440
Sensei, will you take this client on?

103
00:04:34,530 --> 00:04:38,000
No, my specialty is divorce.

104
00:04:38,000 --> 00:04:41,450
I have no experience in compensation
lawsuits against corporations.

105
00:04:41,450 --> 00:04:43,090
Don't say that.

106
00:04:43,090 --> 00:04:46,090
Sensei, your specialty in the past
was corporate law, wasn't it?

107
00:04:46,090 --> 00:04:47,760
What, is that so?

108
00:04:47,760 --> 00:04:49,340
Well, concerning that...

109
00:04:49,340 --> 00:04:51,440
He was quite outstanding,

110
00:04:51,440 --> 00:04:54,340
he fought tooth and nail
against corporations.

111
00:04:54,340 --> 00:04:55,600
Wow.

112
00:04:55,600 --> 00:04:57,600
Then what's the problem, Sensei?

113
00:04:57,600 --> 00:04:58,590
Please.

114
00:04:58,590 --> 00:05:00,390
I will pay you handsomely.

115
00:05:00,370 --> 00:05:03,400
Office landlord:
Toyama Yoshie

116
00:05:00,390 --> 00:05:03,640
You don't have anything else to
do anyway, do you, Sensei?

117
00:05:05,370 --> 00:05:08,830
I will go all out on this one!

118
00:05:08,830 --> 00:05:11,240
You don't have to display
your enthusiasm.

119
00:05:11,240 --> 00:05:12,270
You really don't.

120
00:05:12,270 --> 00:05:13,950
No, I want to.

121

Divorce Chaser Episode 7
Infiltrate the Suspicious Marriage Consultation Firm!

123
00:05:29,600 --> 00:05:32,520
Let me know what day you're going
to the marriage consultation firm.

124
00:05:32,520 --> 00:05:34,700
I'll be going with you.

125
00:05:38,430 --> 00:05:40,790
Kurumi-chan is all fired up.

126
00:05:40,790 --> 00:05:42,350
You're right.

127
00:05:42,350 --> 00:05:45,950
I've never seen her so insistent
about a client before.

128
00:05:45,950 --> 00:05:48,880
I understand how she feels, sort of.

129
00:05:48,880 --> 00:05:50,910
Meaning?

130
00:05:50,910 --> 00:05:52,120
Look at this.

131
00:05:53,660 --> 00:05:55,140
Who's this?

132
00:05:55,140 --> 00:05:57,420
That's Kurumi-chan. From four years ago.

133
00:05:58,410 --> 00:05:59,660
What?

134
00:06:00,620 --> 00:06:02,790
Before she became an investigator,

135
00:06:02,730 --> 00:06:06,230
4 years ago

136
00:06:02,790 --> 00:06:06,000
she was a regular salaried
employee of a commerce company.

137
00:06:06,000 --> 00:06:07,070
Kurumi!

138
00:06:07,200 --> 00:06:10,570
Umemoto Kurumi (4 years ago)

139
00:06:07,710 --> 00:06:10,700
Oh, Yohei! Are you done, too?

140
00:06:10,700 --> 00:06:12,970
Yeah, let's go home together.

141
00:06:12,970 --> 00:06:15,360
She had a lover who worked
at the same company.

142
00:06:15,360 --> 00:06:17,010
They were virtually living together,

143
00:06:17,010 --> 00:06:20,110
and were even discussing marriage.

144
00:06:20,520 --> 00:06:21,950
But...

145
00:06:21,950 --> 00:06:24,020
You're being transferred
to the Osaka branch?

146
00:06:24,530 --> 00:06:25,930
For how long?

147
00:06:26,710 --> 00:06:29,060
The company says for six months.

148
00:06:29,060 --> 00:06:30,670
Six months...

149
00:06:31,470 --> 00:06:33,580
This is a good opportunity for me.

150
00:06:35,070 --> 00:06:36,570
But, I'm making a promise.

151
00:06:39,160 --> 00:06:40,230
What?

152
00:06:40,230 --> 00:06:42,220
When I come back to Tokyo,

153
00:06:42,220 --> 00:06:43,560
let's get married.

154
00:06:44,540 --> 00:06:45,990
Yohei...

155
00:06:47,270 --> 00:06:51,900
That's how their six-month
long-distance relationship started.

156
00:06:53,260 --> 00:06:55,280
Hello, Yohei?

157
00:06:55,280 --> 00:06:57,440
Today's your birthday, isn't it?

158
00:06:57,440 --> 00:06:59,770
Sorry, I'm still at work.

159
00:07:04,450 --> 00:07:08,520
Kurumi-chan doesn't act like it,
but she doesn't like being alone.

160
00:07:08,520 --> 00:07:12,900
I think the stress of the long-distance
relationship took a toll on her.

161
00:07:12,900 --> 00:07:16,230
We cannot answer your call right now.

162
00:07:16,230 --> 00:07:19,810
Please leave a message at the beep.

163
00:07:34,480 --> 00:07:37,620
Kurumi, I'm home.

164
00:07:35,390 --> 00:07:37,620
Six months later

165
00:07:39,850 --> 00:07:41,760
Yohei! Welcome home!

166
00:07:43,260 --> 00:07:45,010
Who are you?

167
00:07:45,010 --> 00:07:47,850
What do you mean? It's me, Kurumi.

168
00:07:48,250 --> 00:07:49,770
The marriage is off.

169
00:07:49,770 --> 00:07:50,990
Huh?

170
00:07:50,990 --> 00:07:53,210
You said we'd get married
when you came back to Tokyo.

171
00:07:53,210 --> 00:07:55,400
Look at your body.
How can you speak of marriage?

172
00:07:55,400 --> 00:07:57,380
Have you looked in the mirror lately?

173
00:07:57,380 --> 00:07:58,060
Give the ring back.

174
00:07:58,060 --> 00:07:59,150
Hey, what are you doing?

175
00:07:59,150 --> 00:07:59,690
Give it.

176
00:07:59,690 --> 00:08:01,800
Stop it! Ow, that hurts!

177
00:08:05,450 --> 00:08:07,890
It was quite the shock to her.

178
00:08:13,460 --> 00:08:15,910
Someone who was once so kind to her

179
00:08:15,910 --> 00:08:20,570
changed completely just because
her appearance changed.

180
00:08:20,930 --> 00:08:22,430
I see.

181
00:08:22,900 --> 00:08:24,100
Right.

182
00:08:24,720 --> 00:08:30,750
She can't forgive people who disparage
other people's appearances.

183
00:08:37,100 --> 00:08:39,890
I'm the representative of
Get-Marriage, Ozaki.

184
00:08:39,890 --> 00:08:43,020
I'm Yukawa-sama's assistant, Tachibana.

185
00:08:40,250 --> 00:08:43,020
Natsuko's assistant:
Tachibana Tetsu

186
00:08:43,020 --> 00:08:45,180
I'm Hakamada, attorney at law.

187
00:08:45,180 --> 00:08:46,660
Please, have a seat.

188
00:08:48,100 --> 00:08:50,560
Well, this is quite a surprise.

189
00:08:50,560 --> 00:08:52,790
You even hired an attorney.

190
00:08:52,790 --> 00:08:54,230
Of course.

191
00:08:54,230 --> 00:08:58,670
I intend to clearly expose
your wrongdoings.

192
00:08:58,670 --> 00:09:00,320
That's unfair.

193
00:09:00,320 --> 00:09:05,340
Our Get-Marriage has the number one
success rate in the matchmaking industry.

194
00:09:05,340 --> 00:09:08,800
We have extremely high rates
of customer satisfaction.

195
00:09:08,800 --> 00:09:13,530
We have introduced many
partners to Yukawa-sama.

196
00:09:13,530 --> 00:09:16,480
Every one of them had
outstanding personal backgrounds.

197
00:09:16,480 --> 00:09:19,380
But, I haven't found a partner.

198
00:09:19,740 --> 00:09:22,490
Are you hiring planted fakes to keep
collecting membership dues?

199
00:09:22,490 --> 00:09:25,250
Our company would never
do anything like that.

200
00:09:25,250 --> 00:09:28,470
The law is very strict
about such things.

201
00:09:28,470 --> 00:09:32,860
Also, Yukawa-sama has
not been satisfied,

202
00:09:32,860 --> 00:09:36,030
so we have repeatedly recommended
that she cancel her membership.

203
00:09:36,030 --> 00:09:37,810
Is that so?

204
00:09:37,810 --> 00:09:39,250
Well, yes...

205
00:09:39,250 --> 00:09:42,290
If her dues were all that we wanted,
we wouldn't have done that.

206
00:09:42,290 --> 00:09:47,880
We have done our utmost to satisfy
Yukawa-sama's demands.

207
00:09:47,880 --> 00:09:51,660
But, as to why she cannot
find a partner...

208
00:09:51,660 --> 00:09:54,070
well, the cause must lie elsewhere.

209
00:09:54,070 --> 00:09:55,290
Just a second.

210
00:09:55,290 --> 00:09:58,280
You want to lay the
blame on Natsuko-san?

211
00:09:58,280 --> 00:09:59,260
Kurumi-san, wait.

212
00:09:59,260 --> 00:10:01,930
I never said that.

213
00:10:02,330 --> 00:10:05,000
I think Yukawa-sama is
a magnificent woman.

214
00:10:05,000 --> 00:10:07,360
Let me ask you, Mr. Assistant.

215
00:10:07,360 --> 00:10:09,190
Are you married?

216
00:10:09,740 --> 00:10:11,370
No, not yet.

217
00:10:11,370 --> 00:10:15,670
How does a person who's never been
married assist in matchmaking?

218
00:10:15,670 --> 00:10:16,470
Right!

219
00:10:16,470 --> 00:10:19,800
These men don't
understand women at all!

220
00:10:19,800 --> 00:10:21,140
Yukawa-san, please—

221
00:10:21,140 --> 00:10:23,360
Your necktie and shirt
combos are always

222
00:10:23,360 --> 00:10:24,860
hideously mismatched!

223
00:10:24,860 --> 00:10:26,880
Yellow necktie and blue shirt?

224
00:10:26,880 --> 00:10:28,640
No sensibility!

225
00:10:28,640 --> 00:10:31,920
And look at you, with
those smarmy rings.

226
00:10:31,920 --> 00:10:34,890
Are you flaunting the money
you gouged from your members?

227
00:10:34,890 --> 00:10:36,320
Both of you, please calm down.

228
00:10:36,320 --> 00:10:37,580
Kanae-san, take them outside.

229
00:10:37,580 --> 00:10:39,170
Yes, let's go.

230
00:10:39,170 --> 00:10:41,660
What? We didn't say anything wrong.

231
00:10:41,660 --> 00:10:43,000
This way.

232
00:10:43,960 --> 00:10:46,910
I find their comments offensive.

233
00:10:46,910 --> 00:10:49,670
Perhaps I could counter
sue them for slander?

234
00:10:50,540 --> 00:10:52,240
I apologize.

235
00:10:52,690 --> 00:10:56,550
Well, I don't want matters
to get out of hand.

236
00:10:56,550 --> 00:10:58,820
We will ask for Yukawa-sama
to cancel her membership,

237
00:10:58,820 --> 00:11:03,450
and refund half of her membership fees.

238
00:11:03,450 --> 00:11:04,950
Do we have a deal?

239
00:11:06,290 --> 00:11:08,100
Please let me discuss it with her.

240
00:11:10,530 --> 00:11:12,030
Sir.

241
00:11:14,000 --> 00:11:16,440
Do you think we're in the clear?

242
00:11:17,060 --> 00:11:20,330
Get rid of our list.

243
00:11:20,970 --> 00:11:23,240
The "planted" list?

244
00:11:23,840 --> 00:11:25,870
I wouldn't worry about it.

245
00:11:26,670 --> 00:11:32,860
That lanky, frumpy lawyer doesn't
have the means to investigate us.

246
00:11:34,350 --> 00:11:36,680
Hakamada Law Office

247
00:11:35,920 --> 00:11:37,960
Half of all the dues I've paid?

248
00:11:37,960 --> 00:11:40,900
I won't settle for that!

249
00:11:40,900 --> 00:11:43,010
What's the point of
being your client,

250
00:11:43,010 --> 00:11:45,460
if she was going to settle for that?

251
00:11:46,770 --> 00:11:50,160
Considering the circumstances,
I don't think that's a bad deal.

252
00:11:50,160 --> 00:11:52,470
It's not like you to say
such things, Sensei.

253
00:11:52,470 --> 00:11:55,090
You're a compensation lawsuit
specialist, aren't you?

254
00:11:55,090 --> 00:11:58,660
As I said, I'm a divorce specialist.

255
00:11:58,660 --> 00:12:01,320
Anyway, based on the current situation,

256
00:12:01,910 --> 00:12:04,590
it would be difficult to
sue them for compensation.

257
00:12:04,590 --> 00:12:06,010
Is that so?

258
00:12:06,010 --> 00:12:06,670
No.

259
00:12:06,670 --> 00:12:07,850
Don't worry.

260
00:12:07,850 --> 00:12:09,480
We'll do something about this.

261
00:12:09,480 --> 00:12:12,540
Kurumi-san, please don't take
matters into your own hands.

262
00:12:12,540 --> 00:12:14,130
I have an idea.

263
00:12:14,130 --> 00:12:15,810
What idea?

264
00:12:15,810 --> 00:12:17,810
Infiltration.

265
00:12:23,230 --> 00:12:25,700
Marriage interview
party

266
00:12:27,430 --> 00:12:30,580
Okay! The three minutes are up.

267
00:12:30,580 --> 00:12:32,560
Now, gentlemen,

268
00:12:32,560 --> 00:12:37,450
please take your profile cards
and move to the adjacent seat.

269
00:12:38,040 --> 00:12:40,010
As quickly as possible, please.

270
00:12:40,890 --> 00:12:43,250
How did I get roped into this?

271
00:12:45,480 --> 00:12:48,080
Speed dating, round two.

272
00:12:48,080 --> 00:12:50,370
Let's go!

273
00:12:51,860 --> 00:12:53,860
I'm Umemoto Kurumi.

274
00:12:53,860 --> 00:12:55,430
I work as a researcher.

275
00:12:55,430 --> 00:12:57,600
I see.

276
00:12:57,600 --> 00:13:00,300
Lately, I've been addicted
to a foreign drama.

277
00:13:00,300 --> 00:13:01,940
Do you know it?

278
00:13:01,940 --> 00:13:04,440
"Iron Spy Woman: Marilyn."

279
00:13:04,440 --> 00:13:06,710
There is no target I can't blow away.

280
00:13:06,710 --> 00:13:09,040
Your heart is no exception.

281
00:13:10,400 --> 00:13:13,270
Your heart is no exception.

282
00:13:15,150 --> 00:13:17,060
I don't watch dramas.

283
00:13:17,060 --> 00:13:19,150
Is that so?

284
00:13:21,990 --> 00:13:23,710
I've spotted one.

285
00:13:23,710 --> 00:13:26,220
This guy is a planted fake.

286
00:13:26,220 --> 00:13:29,590
Name: Kawajiri Daisuke
Age: 33
Height: 171
Highest education: Keimei Central University
Profession: Private Medical Practice

287
00:13:26,610 --> 00:13:28,200
Keimei graduate, private
medical practitioner.

288
00:13:28,200 --> 00:13:29,590
Annual income of 200,000.

289
00:13:29,590 --> 00:13:32,220
His profile would be
attractive to women,

290
00:13:32,220 --> 00:13:34,770
but he doesn't seem
interested in marriage.

291
00:13:39,570 --> 00:13:42,440
Okay! Our three minutes are up.

292
00:13:42,440 --> 00:13:46,030
Gentlemen, please move to adjacent seats.

293
00:13:47,440 --> 00:13:49,680
Name: Nonomura Kanae
Age: 32
Height: 162
Highest education: College graduate
Profession: Manga illustrator

294
00:13:47,440 --> 00:13:50,500
Wow, you're a manga illustrator?

295
00:13:50,950 --> 00:13:52,720
I admire creative people.

296
00:13:52,720 --> 00:13:54,680
Oh, thank you very much.

297
00:13:54,680 --> 00:13:56,470
I've been addicted to this drama lately.

298
00:13:56,470 --> 00:13:58,390
Its original manga is very interesting.

299
00:13:58,390 --> 00:14:00,780
He said he didn't watch dramas!

300
00:14:00,780 --> 00:14:04,100
I think manga authors are sublime.

301
00:14:05,440 --> 00:14:07,420
By the way, she's got
one strike already.

302
00:14:07,420 --> 00:14:08,270
What? Wait...

303
00:14:08,270 --> 00:14:09,150
Huh?

304
00:14:10,870 --> 00:14:14,340
Oh, I admire people
who have life experience.

305
00:14:15,240 --> 00:14:17,970
I've been speed dating
like this for years...

306
00:14:18,520 --> 00:14:20,290
but of all the women
I've interviewed with,

307
00:14:20,290 --> 00:14:22,170
you're the most wonderful.

308
00:14:23,270 --> 00:14:25,170
Are you for real?!

309
00:14:25,170 --> 00:14:26,610
Did you hear that?

310
00:14:26,610 --> 00:14:28,290
That must be a plant.

311
00:14:29,730 --> 00:14:33,590
I-I'm sorry.

312
00:14:34,490 --> 00:14:36,950
Hakamada-sensei is participating, too?

313
00:14:36,950 --> 00:14:38,910
I had to twist his arm, but...

314
00:14:38,910 --> 00:14:40,860
You mumble, you don't
make eye contact,

315
00:14:40,860 --> 00:14:42,910
and all you talk about is bread!

316
00:14:42,910 --> 00:14:45,200
Do you really want to marry someone?

317
00:14:47,330 --> 00:14:48,940
Yes, yes.

318
00:14:52,270 --> 00:14:55,270
Okay. Gentleman number 6!

319
00:14:55,640 --> 00:14:56,940
Iizuka-san!

320
00:14:56,940 --> 00:14:57,920
Yes.

321
00:14:57,920 --> 00:14:59,410
Lady number 2.

322
00:14:59,410 --> 00:15:00,580
Nojima-san.

323
00:15:00,580 --> 00:15:01,380
Yes.

324
00:15:01,380 --> 00:15:03,100
Congratulations.

325
00:15:05,500 --> 00:15:08,300
What a happy occasion.

326
00:15:08,300 --> 00:15:09,290
How do you feel?

327
00:15:09,290 --> 00:15:12,020
They've paired five couples already.

328
00:15:12,020 --> 00:15:15,090
They say they're number one
in the matchmaking industry.

329
00:15:15,090 --> 00:15:17,440
Perhaps it's not a scam.

330
00:15:17,440 --> 00:15:19,200
It's suspicious.

331
00:15:19,200 --> 00:15:22,840
For example, I, an alluring woman,
have been left out.

332
00:15:22,840 --> 00:15:24,790
They give the newcomers
the cold shoulder,

333
00:15:24,790 --> 00:15:27,570
then they try to prolong
our membership.

334
00:15:27,570 --> 00:15:29,500
Now, on to the next.

335
00:15:29,500 --> 00:15:31,820
Gentleman number 9, Kawajiri-san.

336
00:15:31,820 --> 00:15:33,120
Yes.

337
00:15:33,120 --> 00:15:37,050
Lady number 8, Nonomura-san.

338
00:15:37,050 --> 00:15:38,860
Oh... yes.

339
00:15:39,840 --> 00:15:42,260
Congratulations.

340
00:15:42,260 --> 00:15:44,290
We have yet another couple.

341
00:15:47,240 --> 00:15:49,530
Nonomura-san, how do you feel?

342
00:15:49,530 --> 00:15:51,990
I never thought I'd be picked.

343
00:15:51,990 --> 00:15:53,120
I'm shocked.

344
00:15:53,120 --> 00:15:55,200
What annoying modesty.

345
00:15:55,200 --> 00:15:58,720
We have one more couple left.

346
00:15:58,720 --> 00:16:00,470
Let me announce them!

347
00:16:00,470 --> 00:16:03,210
First, lady number 1.

348
00:16:03,210 --> 00:16:04,810
Kuramochi-san.

349
00:16:05,250 --> 00:16:06,110
Yes.

350
00:16:06,110 --> 00:16:08,310
Gentleman number 10.

351
00:16:08,310 --> 00:16:10,410
Hakamada-san.

352
00:16:10,940 --> 00:16:12,650
Congratulations!

353
00:16:15,480 --> 00:16:18,630
Isn't that nice?

354
00:16:16,530 --> 00:16:19,930
Sensei, too? But why?

355
00:16:20,530 --> 00:16:23,290
Hakamada-san. How do you feel?

356
00:16:25,440 --> 00:16:27,410
I want our relationship to be warm,

357
00:16:27,410 --> 00:16:29,920
like freshly baked bread.

358
00:16:32,470 --> 00:16:34,570
What an annoying analogy.

359
00:16:36,700 --> 00:16:39,110
Don't get carried away
because you got paired.

360
00:16:39,110 --> 00:16:41,500
This is just an investigation.

361
00:16:41,500 --> 00:16:43,050
Of course, I am aware of that.

362
00:16:43,050 --> 00:16:46,410
Kurumi-san, you're the one getting
carried away. You're seriously upset.

363
00:16:46,410 --> 00:16:48,300
I'm not upset at all.

364
00:16:49,120 --> 00:16:51,900
Were you satisfied with the
marriage interview party?

365
00:16:51,900 --> 00:16:52,990
Ozaki-san.

366
00:16:53,810 --> 00:16:57,010
Are you trying to infiltrate us?

367
00:16:57,010 --> 00:16:59,030
I can't say I approve.

368
00:16:59,600 --> 00:17:01,910
I will pretend this never happened,

369
00:17:01,910 --> 00:17:03,810
as long as you never do this again.

370
00:17:03,810 --> 00:17:06,500
You're making a nuisance
of yourselves to our members.

371
00:17:07,620 --> 00:17:09,350
I understand.

372
00:17:09,350 --> 00:17:10,710
I apologize.

373
00:17:21,820 --> 00:17:23,990
Hakamada
Law Office

374
00:17:23,520 --> 00:17:24,710
How did it go?

375
00:17:24,710 --> 00:17:25,720
Did you get paired?

376
00:17:25,720 --> 00:17:27,600
Well...

377
00:17:27,600 --> 00:17:29,920
That's not important.

378
00:17:29,920 --> 00:17:33,730
Sensei, don't get carried away
because you got paired up, too.

379
00:17:33,730 --> 00:17:35,400
I'm not getting carried away.

380
00:17:35,400 --> 00:17:37,570
Sensei was paired?

381
00:17:37,570 --> 00:17:38,850
That's too weird.

382
00:17:38,850 --> 00:17:44,620
I think we shouldn't investigate
Get-Marriage directly for now.

383
00:17:44,620 --> 00:17:47,040
President Ozaki warned us, as well.

384
00:17:47,040 --> 00:17:50,580
They're definitely suspicious, though.

385
00:17:50,580 --> 00:17:51,870
Indeed.

386
00:17:51,870 --> 00:17:54,330
They are on the lookout for us,

387
00:17:54,330 --> 00:17:57,030
so there's a high probability
they've got something to hide.

388
00:17:57,030 --> 00:17:59,590
That's where my investigation comes in.

389
00:18:00,600 --> 00:18:02,420
This case pertains to my client.

390
00:18:02,420 --> 00:18:05,060
Please follow my instructions.

391
00:18:08,390 --> 00:18:09,000
Oh.

392
00:18:09,820 --> 00:18:11,110
Who is it?

393
00:18:11,110 --> 00:18:13,410
The lady I was coupled with.

394
00:18:13,410 --> 00:18:16,280
You even exchanged phone numbers?

395
00:18:16,280 --> 00:18:17,570
Hello.

396
00:18:18,370 --> 00:18:20,230
It was nice meeting you today.

397
00:18:21,220 --> 00:18:22,570
Tonight?

398
00:18:23,130 --> 00:18:24,370
No.

399
00:18:24,370 --> 00:18:25,960
I'm not busy.

400
00:18:25,960 --> 00:18:28,750
They're going on a date
right off the bat.

401
00:18:28,750 --> 00:18:31,040
You see? He got carried away.

402
00:18:35,140 --> 00:18:36,160
Ah.

403
00:18:36,160 --> 00:18:39,420
Well, Kanae-san.

404
00:18:39,420 --> 00:18:41,050
Could that be your partner?

405
00:18:41,050 --> 00:18:42,480
Oh, yes.

406
00:18:42,480 --> 00:18:47,580
But, I'm going to properly explain
my situation, and turn him down.

407
00:18:49,480 --> 00:18:50,980
Wait a second!

408
00:18:50,980 --> 00:18:51,940
What?

409
00:18:51,940 --> 00:18:54,010
Your partner...

410
00:18:54,010 --> 00:18:56,480
Didn't he say he was
a long-time member?

411
00:19:00,360 --> 00:19:03,930
I was only participating in the
speed-dating party for research.

412
00:19:03,930 --> 00:19:05,840
I'm very sorry.

413
00:19:05,840 --> 00:19:07,690
I see.

414
00:19:08,350 --> 00:19:11,100
But you are single,
aren't you, Kanae-san?

415
00:19:11,100 --> 00:19:12,840
Well, yes...

416
00:19:12,840 --> 00:19:15,030
Even if it was just research,

417
00:19:15,030 --> 00:19:17,640
we've still managed
to meet each other.

418
00:19:18,400 --> 00:19:21,760
Please date me,
with an eye toward marriage!

419
00:19:21,760 --> 00:19:23,040
I'm sorry.

420
00:19:23,040 --> 00:19:25,200
I don't care if you've got one strike.

421
00:19:25,200 --> 00:19:26,870
I will embrace your past,
and love you and the whole package—

422
00:19:26,870 --> 00:19:28,020
I'm sorry.

423
00:19:28,820 --> 00:19:30,510
Please give up on her.

424
00:19:30,510 --> 00:19:31,510
Huh?

425
00:19:31,510 --> 00:19:35,960
I'm here today because I want you
to tell me about Get-Marriage.

426
00:19:35,960 --> 00:19:37,510
What do you want to know?

427
00:19:37,510 --> 00:19:40,870
Have you ever been
dissatisfied by them?

428
00:19:41,740 --> 00:19:44,090
They're very considerate.

429
00:19:44,090 --> 00:19:47,330
I'm registered with other
matchmaking establishments,

430
00:19:47,330 --> 00:19:50,330
but in comparison to the others,
they're warm and accommodating.

431
00:19:50,330 --> 00:19:52,880
Have you ever suspected
they might have planted fakes?

432
00:19:52,880 --> 00:19:54,530
I don't believe there's
anything like that.

433
00:19:54,530 --> 00:19:58,170
I've always gotten legitimate
responses from matches.

434
00:19:58,590 --> 00:20:01,310
Oh, but come to think of it,

435
00:20:01,310 --> 00:20:04,050
there was this one time
I got turned down.

436
00:20:04,050 --> 00:20:05,040
By whom?

437
00:20:06,580 --> 00:20:08,810
She's the chief editor
of a gourmet magazine.

438
00:20:08,810 --> 00:20:10,550
This was Yukawa Natsuko-san?

439
00:20:10,550 --> 00:20:12,550
That might've been her name—

440
00:20:12,550 --> 00:20:15,940
And who was the assistant at that time?

441
00:20:15,940 --> 00:20:18,150
His name was Tachibana-san.

442
00:20:37,540 --> 00:20:39,240
Hakamada Law Office

443
00:20:37,540 --> 00:20:39,240
You were being followed?

444
00:20:39,240 --> 00:20:41,450
Did you get a look at him?

445
00:20:42,130 --> 00:20:44,770
I could only see his back,

446
00:20:44,770 --> 00:20:46,880
so I can't be sure who he was...

447
00:20:48,570 --> 00:20:52,030
But I think that it was
Tachibana-san of Get-Marriage.

448
00:20:52,030 --> 00:20:53,640
Tachibana-san?

449
00:20:53,640 --> 00:20:57,070
Actually, this isn't the first
time something like this happened.

450
00:20:57,070 --> 00:20:58,470
Can you explain?

451
00:20:59,000 --> 00:21:01,920
I've been followed several
times before, on my way home.

452
00:21:01,920 --> 00:21:07,350
There was a man asking
about me at a local bar I frequent.

453
00:21:07,350 --> 00:21:10,430
You think Tachibana-san
has been doing these things?

454
00:21:11,270 --> 00:21:13,030
It's very possible.

455
00:21:13,840 --> 00:21:17,640
This was the first time I actually
saw him in person, though.

456
00:21:18,190 --> 00:21:20,480
I wonder what's they're scheming.

457
00:21:20,480 --> 00:21:22,520
We have testimony from a member

458
00:21:22,520 --> 00:21:27,290
that Tachibana-san has been obstructing
Natsuko-san from finding a partner.

459
00:21:27,290 --> 00:21:29,150
Tachibana-san...

460
00:21:32,150 --> 00:21:33,760
Excuse me for a moment.

461
00:21:36,630 --> 00:21:37,950
Hello.

462
00:21:37,950 --> 00:21:40,240
I enjoyed the visit.

463
00:21:40,240 --> 00:21:43,200
That must be his partner.

464
00:21:43,200 --> 00:21:45,730
He's totally immersed
in "get married" mode.

465
00:21:45,730 --> 00:21:48,650
Ah, that's it! Tachibana
has been following

466
00:21:48,650 --> 00:21:51,210
and gathering personal
information about me,

467
00:21:51,210 --> 00:21:55,330
so he can find a completely
mismatched man for me!

468
00:21:55,330 --> 00:21:57,160
That is entirely conceivable.

469
00:21:57,160 --> 00:22:00,310
But, Get-Marriage has
over a thousand members.

470
00:22:00,310 --> 00:22:05,260
Would they go to such lengths
to scam a single member?

471
00:22:05,800 --> 00:22:10,890
Maybe Tachibana-san has a personal
grudge against Natsuko-san.

472
00:22:10,890 --> 00:22:12,590
Against me?

473
00:22:12,590 --> 00:22:15,230
Can you think of some
reason why he would?

474
00:22:16,410 --> 00:22:17,660
No...

475
00:22:18,080 --> 00:22:19,540
Not particularly.

476
00:22:21,390 --> 00:22:24,460
A reason why someone would have a
grudge against chief editor Yukawa?

477
00:22:24,460 --> 00:22:25,460
Yes.

478
00:22:25,460 --> 00:22:27,540
Misato-san, you're in the same office.

479
00:22:27,540 --> 00:22:30,380
I thought you might know something.

480
00:22:30,380 --> 00:22:33,880
Well... I can think of many reasons.

481
00:22:33,880 --> 00:22:35,560
You know her personality.

482
00:22:35,560 --> 00:22:37,100
She makes lots of enemies.

483
00:22:37,100 --> 00:22:38,390
I see.

484
00:22:41,910 --> 00:22:42,960
Hello?

485
00:22:42,960 --> 00:22:45,260
It's Kurumi. Have you found anything out?

486
00:22:45,260 --> 00:22:48,440
I've been speaking with
my editor about her.

487
00:22:48,440 --> 00:22:49,490
I see.

488
00:22:49,490 --> 00:22:52,230
I investigated Tachibana's history.

489
00:22:52,230 --> 00:22:56,440
That guy was proprietor of a ramen shop
before he landed the present job.

490
00:22:56,440 --> 00:22:58,930
His shop went bust in less than a year,

491
00:22:58,930 --> 00:23:00,980
and he's been knee-deep in debt.

492
00:23:00,980 --> 00:23:03,470
He's got debts from a ramen shop?

493
00:23:03,470 --> 00:23:05,030
A ramen shop?

494
00:23:05,400 --> 00:23:06,780
Does that ring a bell?

495
00:23:06,780 --> 00:23:10,030
Maybe his shop was featured in an
article in Yukawa's magazine.

496
00:23:10,030 --> 00:23:13,940
There was a time they had an article
with scathing reviews of ramen shops.

497
00:23:13,940 --> 00:23:15,930
Maybe his shop got reviewed,

498
00:23:15,930 --> 00:23:18,630
and that's where his grudge came from.

499
00:23:18,630 --> 00:23:20,200
That's it!

500
00:23:20,240 --> 00:23:23,010
I knew he had a personal grudge.

501
00:23:23,010 --> 00:23:26,470
I'm going to go see Tachibana,
and nail him to the wall.

502
00:23:26,470 --> 00:23:30,040
Wait, before you do that, we should
get Hakamada-sensei's instructions...

503
00:23:30,040 --> 00:23:32,510
We were warned by Get-Marriage, too...

504
00:23:32,510 --> 00:23:36,070
This iron woman isn't
intimidated by warnings.

505
00:23:39,790 --> 00:23:41,140
I feel it.

506
00:23:42,730 --> 00:23:43,920
What?

507
00:23:43,920 --> 00:23:48,560
I feel a tremendous grudge the
man called Tachibana has against

508
00:23:48,560 --> 00:23:51,090
the female chief editor.

509
00:23:51,090 --> 00:23:53,890
Yes, but we know that already.

510
00:24:00,250 --> 00:24:02,570
Can I talk to you for a minute?

511
00:24:04,550 --> 00:24:06,770
Do you remember this?

512
00:24:08,380 --> 00:24:12,690
It's got an article about
your ex-ramen shop.

513
00:24:08,380 --> 00:24:14,950
Ramen,
Yeah Right!

514
00:24:10,330 --> 00:24:14,950
"Ramen Tachibana"

515
00:24:10,970 --> 00:24:14,950
Evaluation:
Materials
Noodles
Soup

516
00:24:12,690 --> 00:24:15,810
It's quite a harsh review.

517
00:24:17,520 --> 00:24:20,470
Several months after the publication,
your establishment went under,

518
00:24:20,470 --> 00:24:23,570
and you were left with an enormous debt.

519
00:24:24,140 --> 00:24:27,040
You've had a grudge ever
since, haven't you?

520
00:24:27,040 --> 00:24:30,180
Against Natsuki-san,
the author of the article.

521
00:24:31,070 --> 00:24:32,900
That's not true!

522
00:24:32,900 --> 00:24:36,770
My restaurant's business was
declining way before the article.

523
00:24:37,270 --> 00:24:39,170
The article had nothing to do with it.

524
00:24:39,170 --> 00:24:42,230
My restaurant was destined to close.

525
00:24:43,670 --> 00:24:47,030
You could say I'm actually thankful
to Yukawa-sama about that,

526
00:24:47,490 --> 00:24:50,220
because that article woke
me up to the hard facts.

527
00:24:50,220 --> 00:24:53,830
Then why are you obstructing
Natsuko-san's marriage interviews?

528
00:24:53,830 --> 00:24:58,090
I heard you spread bad rumors
about her to prospective partners.

529
00:25:00,170 --> 00:25:03,000
I'm not allowed to discuss
proprietary information.

530
00:25:03,000 --> 00:25:04,260
Wait, you!

531
00:25:04,260 --> 00:25:05,910
Please, leave me alone!

532
00:25:05,910 --> 00:25:08,270
Representative Ozaki is
stringent about rules.

533
00:25:08,270 --> 00:25:09,910
If he found out I relayed
proprietary information,

534
00:25:09,910 --> 00:25:11,660
or that I got involved with a member,

535
00:25:11,660 --> 00:25:15,910
I'd be quickly fired, and
forced to pay 15 million yen.

536
00:25:15,910 --> 00:25:18,580
We know you've been following
Natsuko-san around!

537
00:25:20,060 --> 00:25:25,080
What would you do if
that fact got publicized?

538
00:25:25,700 --> 00:25:27,950
I think that's enough of that.

539
00:25:28,680 --> 00:25:32,660
I warned you to stop
sniffing around us.

540
00:25:34,300 --> 00:25:35,990
Who are you calling?

541
00:25:36,410 --> 00:25:37,990
The police.

542
00:25:39,220 --> 00:25:43,650
Your actions are no
different from blackmail.

543
00:25:47,040 --> 00:25:49,680
I told you not to do reckless
investigations, did I not?!

544
00:25:51,070 --> 00:25:54,550
I got a serious warning
from the police.

545
00:25:54,990 --> 00:25:56,550
One more wrong move,

546
00:25:56,550 --> 00:25:58,680
and you could have been arrested.

547
00:25:59,480 --> 00:26:01,650
But, we need to find a way to win—

548
00:26:01,650 --> 00:26:05,490
Win or lose, that's my responsibility.

549
00:26:07,180 --> 00:26:08,930
Because of what happened,

550
00:26:08,930 --> 00:26:12,130
Get-Marriage will
tighten their security.

551
00:26:13,820 --> 00:26:16,270
Now it will be harder than
ever to gather evidence.

552
00:26:18,100 --> 00:26:23,320
You have worsened circumstances
considerably for our client.

553
00:26:24,890 --> 00:26:28,630
Please cease your
involvement with this case.

554
00:26:33,400 --> 00:26:34,860
Understood.

555
00:26:39,840 --> 00:26:41,820
Um... here.

556
00:26:42,660 --> 00:26:46,270
I recorded my conversation
with Tachibana.

557
00:26:46,270 --> 00:26:48,670
I was hoping it might be of some use.

558
00:26:53,770 --> 00:26:55,670
Excuse me.

559
00:26:59,230 --> 00:27:02,410
Let's go out for drinks.
It's happy time.

560
00:27:02,410 --> 00:27:03,650
Marilyn.

561
00:27:04,800 --> 00:27:05,970
Huh?

562
00:27:07,650 --> 00:27:09,020
Was there a fight?

563
00:27:09,020 --> 00:27:10,750
Yes. Somewhat.

564
00:27:16,690 --> 00:27:19,150
I see.

565
00:27:19,150 --> 00:27:21,230
Kurumi-chan overdid it.

566
00:27:21,230 --> 00:27:24,870
I've never seen
Hakamada-sensei get so angry.

567
00:27:26,720 --> 00:27:31,890
She must've grown impatient with
Hakamada-sensei's procedures.

568
00:27:31,890 --> 00:27:33,340
What do you mean?

569
00:27:34,180 --> 00:27:40,120
There's more to the story
of Kurumi-chan's dissolved engagement.

570
00:27:42,650 --> 00:27:46,190
4 years ago

571
00:27:46,700 --> 00:27:50,530
Umemoto-san, time to
pay this month's rent.

572
00:27:50,530 --> 00:27:51,830
Ms. Landlord...

573
00:27:54,400 --> 00:27:56,890
Are you still sniveling about that?

574
00:27:58,420 --> 00:28:02,460
I'll introduce you to
someone really nice.

575
00:28:02,460 --> 00:28:03,600
Huh?

576
00:28:05,950 --> 00:28:07,630
I understand the situation.

577
00:28:08,890 --> 00:28:10,980
Please leave the rest to me.

578
00:28:10,980 --> 00:28:13,710
Oh. The rice is ready.

579
00:28:18,350 --> 00:28:19,800
Would you like to eat before you go?

580
00:28:19,800 --> 00:28:21,290
It's freshly mixed rice.

581
00:28:21,290 --> 00:28:22,960
Mixed rice?

582
00:28:22,960 --> 00:28:24,930
At that time, Hakamada-sensei

583
00:28:24,930 --> 00:28:27,830
was into mixed rice, and not bread.

584
00:28:27,830 --> 00:28:29,710
Is that so?

585
00:28:30,120 --> 00:28:32,830
And what Hakamada-sensei
did for her after that...

586
00:28:32,830 --> 00:28:34,850
was splendid.

587
00:28:40,680 --> 00:28:43,330
In other words, you're saying
Umemoto-san is entirely at fault

588
00:28:43,330 --> 00:28:45,780
for the engagement dissolving, correct?

589
00:28:46,680 --> 00:28:48,480
Of course.

590
00:28:48,480 --> 00:28:51,690
How could I marry an
unsightly thing like that?

591
00:28:52,990 --> 00:28:54,860
I wonder if that's true.

592
00:29:01,050 --> 00:29:04,930
Here's evidence you were cheating
on her during your stint in Osaka.

593
00:29:07,480 --> 00:29:09,840
I know I'm overstepping
my bounds, but...

594
00:29:10,810 --> 00:29:13,020
before you disparage
people's appearances,

595
00:29:13,020 --> 00:29:15,570
you ought to reflect
on your own actions.

596
00:29:18,800 --> 00:29:21,620
We're suing for one million yen,
for breach of engagement.

597
00:29:22,250 --> 00:29:23,850
You will pay, won't you?

598
00:29:28,810 --> 00:29:31,720
Umemoto-san, you were
lucky this time around.

599
00:29:31,720 --> 00:29:32,920
Huh?

600
00:29:34,490 --> 00:29:38,610
Because you didn't wind
up marrying a cheater,

601
00:29:39,390 --> 00:29:41,460
who shallowly judges people
by their appearances.

602
00:29:57,600 --> 00:29:58,900
Sensei.

603
00:30:00,820 --> 00:30:02,690
What can I do for you?

604
00:30:02,690 --> 00:30:07,060
Will you please let Kurumi-san
continue her investigation?

605
00:30:07,700 --> 00:30:11,740
I can't have her getting us
into any more trouble.

606
00:30:11,740 --> 00:30:13,770
I heard from Yoshie-san.

607
00:30:14,390 --> 00:30:18,870
Kurumi-san was once your
client, wasn't she?

608
00:30:20,670 --> 00:30:22,970
She sure likes to gossip.

609
00:30:23,360 --> 00:30:26,340
Kurumi-san put her
hopes in you, Sensei.

610
00:30:27,580 --> 00:30:29,440
She wanted you to save a client,

611
00:30:29,440 --> 00:30:32,650
who suffered like she once did.

612
00:30:33,750 --> 00:30:35,730
Maybe it's just me,

613
00:30:35,730 --> 00:30:38,610
but you're not yourself this
time around, Hakamada-sensei.

614
00:30:41,140 --> 00:30:44,390
Maybe you got carried away
because you've been paired now,

615
00:30:44,390 --> 00:30:46,360
but you should consider
your client's feelings,

616
00:30:46,360 --> 00:30:48,960
consider her happiness.

617
00:30:48,960 --> 00:30:51,040
Isn't that how you always work, Sensei?

618
00:30:53,760 --> 00:30:58,930
Kurumi-san forced you to
take on this client...

619
00:30:59,290 --> 00:31:02,450
because she believed in you.

620
00:31:04,610 --> 00:31:06,330
In that case, I wish

621
00:31:06,330 --> 00:31:08,920
she had kept believing in me,
just a little longer.

622
00:31:08,920 --> 00:31:10,490
Huh?

623
00:31:10,490 --> 00:31:14,680
I haven't gotten carried away
in the least.

624
00:31:16,130 --> 00:31:19,510
The reason why I was
seeing my partner...

625
00:31:19,510 --> 00:31:24,220
I see, so you wanted to investigate.

626
00:31:25,650 --> 00:31:27,310
I'm truly sorry.

627
00:31:27,310 --> 00:31:31,410
No, I'm glad you were honest with me.

628
00:31:31,870 --> 00:31:36,010
I've gotten into relationships with
partners who stopped calling me,

629
00:31:36,010 --> 00:31:40,250
or reject me outright without
giving any reason whatsoever...

630
00:31:41,140 --> 00:31:42,550
Is that so?

631
00:31:43,180 --> 00:31:45,920
A friend of mine recommended
the company to me.

632
00:31:45,920 --> 00:31:48,180
I've been a member for two years now.

633
00:31:48,180 --> 00:31:51,390
But, it ends the same
way every time.

634
00:31:52,170 --> 00:31:55,700
Would you mind sharing details with me?

635
00:31:55,700 --> 00:31:59,160
She gave me references to other members,

636
00:31:59,160 --> 00:32:01,140
and I spoke with several of them.

637
00:32:01,570 --> 00:32:03,060
Strangely enough,

638
00:32:03,060 --> 00:32:07,390
people's opinions of
Get-Marriage got split in two.

639
00:32:07,390 --> 00:32:09,690
Between those who are completely satisfied,

640
00:32:09,690 --> 00:32:10,910
and those who aren't.

641
00:32:10,910 --> 00:32:13,180
What's that mean?

642
00:32:13,180 --> 00:32:16,550
I think Get-Marriage sorts its members.

643
00:32:16,550 --> 00:32:18,720
They're sorted into people
who will aggressively

644
00:32:18,720 --> 00:32:21,920
get paired, in order to
raise their success rate...

645
00:32:21,920 --> 00:32:23,750
and into people who are scammed,

646
00:32:23,750 --> 00:32:25,970
who only get set up with fakes.

647
00:32:25,970 --> 00:32:29,410
If you know that, you can
sue them for compensation.

648
00:32:29,410 --> 00:32:33,230
The only thing I'm missing
is solid evidence.

649
00:32:33,230 --> 00:32:34,770
However,

650
00:32:35,890 --> 00:32:39,270
thanks to this, I now
have a course of action.

651
00:32:39,270 --> 00:32:40,640
Huh?

652
00:32:40,640 --> 00:32:43,060
Please call Kurumi-san for me.

653
00:32:43,060 --> 00:32:45,900
I need her to do further investigation.

654
00:32:45,900 --> 00:32:47,380
Understood.

655
00:32:48,110 --> 00:32:51,780
Eternal Partners

656
00:32:52,310 --> 00:32:56,510
Have you agreed to our
terms from the other day?

657
00:32:56,880 --> 00:32:57,850
No.

658
00:32:57,850 --> 00:33:01,350
We will be suing for a complete refund
of all membership fees paid,

659
00:33:01,350 --> 00:33:03,790
as well as compensation.

660
00:33:03,790 --> 00:33:05,070
What?

661
00:33:05,070 --> 00:33:06,930
Why have you decided that?

662
00:33:07,380 --> 00:33:14,130
Because you have purposefully obstructed
Natsuko-san from finding a marriage partner.

663
00:33:15,810 --> 00:33:19,920
And what advantage would we have
for doing something like that?

664
00:33:19,920 --> 00:33:20,970
Well.

665
00:33:21,470 --> 00:33:25,590
You've been selecting targets.

666
00:33:26,400 --> 00:33:31,220
You pick out people who
seem prone to rejection...

667
00:33:31,820 --> 00:33:34,790
and to keep raking membership
fees from those people,

668
00:33:34,790 --> 00:33:37,060
you obstruct them
from finding a mate.

669
00:33:38,150 --> 00:33:40,630
That's nonsense.

670
00:33:40,630 --> 00:33:42,170
You have no evidence.

671
00:33:42,170 --> 00:33:45,360
True, I don't have evidence.

672
00:33:45,360 --> 00:33:49,140
However, there is one thing we know.

673
00:33:50,170 --> 00:33:50,810
Tachibana-san.

674
00:33:51,980 --> 00:33:53,040
Yes.

675
00:33:53,040 --> 00:33:58,350
You were obstructing Natsuko-san
for a personal reason, weren't you?

676
00:33:59,650 --> 00:34:01,950
This again?

677
00:34:01,950 --> 00:34:03,800
I don't have a grudge

678
00:34:03,800 --> 00:34:06,580
against Yukawa-sama because
of that ramen shop article.

679
00:34:06,580 --> 00:34:07,760
No.

680
00:34:07,760 --> 00:34:11,190
The personal reason isn't a grudge.

681
00:34:11,190 --> 00:34:12,690
What?

682
00:34:12,690 --> 00:34:15,960
He is fond of Natsuko-san.

683
00:34:17,550 --> 00:34:19,030
Fond?

684
00:34:19,030 --> 00:34:20,880
The first time I noticed,

685
00:34:20,880 --> 00:34:23,450
was when she commented
on your tie and shirt.

686
00:34:23,450 --> 00:34:25,840
Your necktie and shirt
combos are always

687
00:34:25,840 --> 00:34:27,280
hideously mismatched!

688
00:34:27,280 --> 00:34:29,360
Yellow necktie and blue shirt?

689
00:34:29,360 --> 00:34:31,150
No sensibility!

690
00:34:31,150 --> 00:34:34,180
A few days after Natsuko-san
criticized your color combinations,

691
00:34:34,180 --> 00:34:37,270
you took her words faithfully to heart.

692
00:34:37,270 --> 00:34:39,460
You changed the color of your tie.

693
00:34:43,420 --> 00:34:46,480
Because you are fond of Natsuko-san,

694
00:34:46,480 --> 00:34:49,160
you wanted Natsuko-san for yourself...

695
00:34:49,880 --> 00:34:52,370
so you were obstructing her prospects.

696
00:34:54,540 --> 00:34:59,080
You can't infer all that
from the color of my tie.

697
00:34:59,080 --> 00:35:01,300
That's no evidence of anything.

698
00:35:01,300 --> 00:35:03,580
There's more evidence.

699
00:35:07,440 --> 00:35:08,930
Hey, you, enough is enough.

700
00:35:08,930 --> 00:35:10,840
You had fair warning.

701
00:35:11,690 --> 00:35:14,200
I wasn't investigating you two.

702
00:35:14,650 --> 00:35:16,890
I found this site.

703
00:35:17,660 --> 00:35:19,840
The author is anonymous,

704
00:35:17,660 --> 00:35:20,830
Even if I only can talk with her
(Wednesday)
She came to our matchmaking firm again today.
She makes me happy, even speaking with her face to face. Even at my age, she makes my heart pound.

705
00:35:17,660 --> 00:35:20,830
One-sided Confessions of a Matchmaking Firm

706
00:35:19,840 --> 00:35:21,890
but it's blog by an employee
of a matchmaking firm,

707
00:35:20,830 --> 00:35:22,760
The joy of meeting with her

708
00:35:21,890 --> 00:35:25,040
confessing his secret love for a member.

709
00:35:22,760 --> 00:35:24,530
A lovely bar

710
00:35:25,040 --> 00:35:26,850
It talks about how he follows her home,

711
00:35:26,850 --> 00:35:30,020
and how he would get information
about her from people in her social circles.

712
00:35:30,020 --> 00:35:33,270
He's quite passionate about
her, as you can see.

713
00:35:31,140 --> 00:35:32,500
A lovely bar

714
00:35:32,500 --> 00:35:34,270
She's like an angel

715
00:35:33,270 --> 00:35:35,970
Oh yes, and have a look at this.

716
00:35:38,040 --> 00:35:40,450
There's even a picture
of his secret love.

717
00:35:43,920 --> 00:35:47,300
It would be easy to find the blogger.

718
00:35:47,920 --> 00:35:51,410
This is ample evidence, wouldn't
you say, Hakamada-sensei?

719
00:35:51,810 --> 00:35:52,950
Yes.

720
00:35:52,950 --> 00:35:56,090
I expect no less from you,
Investigator Umemoto.

721
00:35:59,620 --> 00:36:01,220
Tachibana-san.

722
00:36:01,220 --> 00:36:04,240
Isn't it time to tell the truth?

723
00:36:07,140 --> 00:36:08,370
Tachibana-san.

724
00:36:08,370 --> 00:36:10,260
I've had enough of you, Tachibana!

725
00:36:10,260 --> 00:36:14,600
Who was it that got
you out of your debt?

726
00:36:16,110 --> 00:36:18,490
Have you forgotten the rules?

727
00:36:18,950 --> 00:36:22,690
Employees that leak proprietary
information will be penalized.

728
00:36:23,970 --> 00:36:26,450
Are you trying to get
yourself in debt again?

729
00:36:27,530 --> 00:36:30,210
Is that the rule that would
force him to pay 15 million yen?

730
00:36:30,930 --> 00:36:33,710
He has exposed the illegal
activities of his company,

731
00:36:33,710 --> 00:36:36,960
and you would penalize him for that?

732
00:36:35,300 --> 00:36:43,440
Public Well-Being Informant Protection Law

733
00:36:35,300 --> 00:36:43,440
The law that protects workers who report unethical insider conduct

734
00:36:36,960 --> 00:36:39,480
Based on the Public Well-Being
Informant Protection Law...

735
00:36:39,480 --> 00:36:40,540
you can't do that.

736
00:36:47,210 --> 00:36:49,490
Shortly after I joined the company,

737
00:36:50,310 --> 00:36:55,310
representative Ozaki gave me a list.

738
00:36:58,560 --> 00:37:00,220
The "planted" list...

739
00:37:01,060 --> 00:37:02,480
What this?

740
00:37:03,050 --> 00:37:08,600
It's a list of members who I believe
are unlikely to find a partner.

741
00:37:08,600 --> 00:37:09,860
What?

742
00:37:11,040 --> 00:37:13,010
Set them up with fake "plants,"

743
00:37:13,010 --> 00:37:15,920
and let them believe
they're getting somewhere.

744
00:37:15,920 --> 00:37:19,890
People like that
desperately cling to us...

745
00:37:20,250 --> 00:37:24,610
and they'll keep paying
membership fees for all eternity.

746
00:37:26,580 --> 00:37:28,320
How awful.

747
00:37:29,070 --> 00:37:34,540
Yukawa-sama's name was
on that list, as well.

748
00:37:34,120 --> 00:37:36,720
Yukawa Natsuko

749
00:37:37,610 --> 00:37:41,710
I thought I'd happened
upon an opportunity.

750
00:37:42,410 --> 00:37:44,330
Because as long as I was setting
her up with nothing but fakes,

751
00:37:44,330 --> 00:37:46,770
I wouldn't have to worry about
Yukawa-sama ever getting married.

752
00:37:49,670 --> 00:37:52,230
It's true that I have
been obstructing her.

753
00:37:52,680 --> 00:37:56,310
I thought maybe some day
she would go out with me.

754
00:37:56,310 --> 00:37:58,680
You shouldn't have been so devious.

755
00:37:58,680 --> 00:38:02,190
Why didn't you just come out and
profess your love to Natsuko-san?

756
00:38:02,190 --> 00:38:04,890
Company rules prohibit relationships with members.

757
00:38:06,480 --> 00:38:08,820
I was afraid of being penalized.

758
00:38:08,820 --> 00:38:10,340
That's why...

759
00:38:10,740 --> 00:38:13,030
that why after Yukawa-sama resigned,

760
00:38:15,890 --> 00:38:19,430
I was going to properly ask her out.

761
00:38:27,440 --> 00:38:29,150
So that's how it is.

762
00:38:29,750 --> 00:38:34,110
It's clear you've been scamming
your members using fakes.

763
00:38:35,450 --> 00:38:38,110
The total membership
fees and compensation...

764
00:38:38,110 --> 00:38:39,560
You will pay, won't you?

765
00:38:41,640 --> 00:38:43,210
And one more thing.

766
00:38:43,830 --> 00:38:44,990
Tachibana-san.

767
00:38:44,990 --> 00:38:49,630
Please inform all members on that list.

768
00:38:50,470 --> 00:38:52,330
Like Natsuko-san,

769
00:38:53,000 --> 00:38:55,100
they have fallen victim to a scam.

770
00:38:59,190 --> 00:39:01,370
If you do that, our company will be ruined!

771
00:39:01,370 --> 00:39:03,840
And what's wrong with that?

772
00:39:04,320 --> 00:39:07,330
After all, you shallowly judge
people based on appearances...

773
00:39:07,860 --> 00:39:10,720
You're not qualified to
oversee human encounters.

774
00:39:16,190 --> 00:39:19,680
Umemoto-san, you were
lucky this time around.

775
00:39:19,680 --> 00:39:23,660
Because you didn't wind
up marrying a cheater,

776
00:39:24,580 --> 00:39:26,930
who shallowly judges people
by their appearances.

777
00:39:36,490 --> 00:39:39,890
You look like an
insignificant lawyer...

778
00:39:41,490 --> 00:39:45,730
but I guess you can't judge
people on appearances.

779
00:39:59,260 --> 00:40:02,600
Hakamada Law Office

780
00:40:02,600 --> 00:40:07,700
Major corporation Get-Marriage crushed
Illicit activities toward its members uncovered

781
00:40:03,050 --> 00:40:06,620
Wow, the matchmaking firm
went out of business.

782
00:40:06,620 --> 00:40:08,940
That's our Hakamada-sensei.

783
00:40:08,940 --> 00:40:12,190
He rescued not one, but many people.

784
00:40:14,240 --> 00:40:18,010
I am truly sorry about how
I behaved this time around.

785
00:40:18,770 --> 00:40:20,280
If you are,

786
00:40:20,280 --> 00:40:23,000
then please do not do reckless
investigations any more.

787
00:40:23,740 --> 00:40:25,190
I understand.

788
00:40:25,920 --> 00:40:28,530
Sensei, we have a guest.

789
00:40:28,530 --> 00:40:29,730
Yes.

790
00:40:31,910 --> 00:40:33,600
Natsuko-san.

791
00:40:33,600 --> 00:40:37,000
Thank you for everything
you have done for me.

792
00:40:37,650 --> 00:40:38,970
You too, dear.

793
00:40:43,360 --> 00:40:46,940
Everyone. I have caused
you much trouble.

794
00:40:46,940 --> 00:40:48,420
Tachibana-san.

795
00:40:48,420 --> 00:40:49,510
Why are you here, too?

796
00:40:50,450 --> 00:40:54,880
Well, we are getting married.

797
00:40:54,880 --> 00:40:55,990
What?

798
00:40:55,990 --> 00:40:59,590
That day, when Tachibana-san
confessed his feelings,

799
00:40:59,590 --> 00:41:01,690
I couldn't get that out of my mind.

800
00:41:01,690 --> 00:41:04,860
So I got brave, and called him.

801
00:41:06,690 --> 00:41:09,220
I brought hardship to many people.

802
00:41:09,220 --> 00:41:12,530
For that, I must make amends
for the rest of my life.

803
00:41:13,450 --> 00:41:18,390
But, Natsuko-san forgave me.

804
00:41:19,570 --> 00:41:24,050
I will make her happy, I promise!

805
00:41:29,720 --> 00:41:31,530
I'm glad for you.

806
00:41:32,670 --> 00:41:38,030
The compensation we received
will help us make a new start.

807
00:41:38,430 --> 00:41:40,820
We cannot thank Sensei enough.

808
00:41:43,920 --> 00:41:46,120
If you're going to show gratitude...

809
00:41:47,700 --> 00:41:49,780
it should be toward her.

810
00:41:49,780 --> 00:41:50,700
Huh?

811
00:41:50,700 --> 00:41:54,450
We couldn't have sued for compensation

812
00:41:54,450 --> 00:41:56,770
without her investigation.

813
00:42:03,420 --> 00:42:08,350
Speaking of which, here is the bill
for the case's investigation.

814
00:42:09,290 --> 00:42:11,470
Can you please wait a little for that?

815
00:42:11,470 --> 00:42:12,890
You said you couldn't have sued for

816
00:42:12,890 --> 00:42:15,260
compensation if it weren't
for my investigation, right?

817
00:42:15,260 --> 00:42:17,420
That and this are unrelated...

818
00:42:17,420 --> 00:42:19,230
Wait! Grab him!

819
00:42:19,230 --> 00:42:20,400
Please, don't do this!

820
00:42:20,400 --> 00:42:22,670
I will pay it.

821
00:42:22,670 --> 00:42:24,700
I promise I'll pay it!

822
00:42:24,700 --> 00:42:27,410
You're taking the children
away from me, too?

823
00:42:24,700 --> 00:42:36,080
Next episode

824
00:42:27,410 --> 00:42:29,410
He's a pathetic husband
who can't find another job.

825
00:42:27,470 --> 00:42:31,610
Childcare worker husband VS career-woman wife

826
00:42:29,410 --> 00:42:31,240
So I threatened
him with a knife.

827
00:42:31,240 --> 00:42:32,880
The wife admits
to illicit activity.

828
00:42:31,610 --> 00:42:36,080
A mess of a custody battle:
What will happen to the children's future?!

829
00:42:32,880 --> 00:42:34,200
In which case we can
sue for compensation.

830
00:42:34,200 --> 00:42:36,080
You're not a
superhero of justice!

831
00:42:36,080 --> 00:42:39,680
You're a villain that's
splitting Mama and Papa apart!

832
00:42:36,250 --> 00:42:39,720
This drama is a work of fiction
