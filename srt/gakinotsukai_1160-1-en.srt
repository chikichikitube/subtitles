00:00:01,000 --> 00:00:06,470
Aired last week, Fujiwara's Heipo Baby Raising Lifestyle - 1 night and 2 days

2
00:00:06,720 --> 00:00:08,770
This will become a "sensation"

3
00:00:11,670 --> 00:00:22,060
In order to make it up to Hamada, Fujiwara will take care of a helpless Heipo baby

4
00:00:25,000 --> 00:00:33,200
A harsh purification! He will need to feed him, change his diaper, and more

5
00:00:34,000 --> 00:00:35,700
Well I guess you had no choice Fujiwara

6
00:00:35,750 --> 00:00:38,810
This is shocking

7
00:00:37,000 --> 00:00:38,810
It's a purification after all

8
00:00:39,940 --> 00:00:45,450
Furthermore, when Fujiwara had to take Heipo for a stroll in Ometesando (A "high class" neighbourhood)

9
00:00:45,480 --> 00:00:48,290
Uwahh

10
00:00:48,380 --> 00:00:49,880
No no no no

11
00:00:49,880 --> 00:00:52,620
This is too much!

12
00:00:50,100 --> 00:00:52,620
This is hard isn't it?

13
00:00:52,650 --> 00:00:55,820
They'll think I'm a pervert!

14
00:00:56,350 --> 00:01:01,860
Heipo ignores his baby role and starts talking normally

15
00:01:01,860 --> 00:01:04,200
Can we stop for a second here?

16
00:01:04,200 --> 00:01:05,400
I've had enough!

17
00:01:05,400 --> 00:01:07,640
I need to go to the bathroom, for real

18
00:01:07,440 --> 00:01:08,040
Yes.

19
00:01:07,650 --> 00:01:09,410
I get sick from drinking milk

20
00:01:10,050 --> 00:01:14,770
The fed up Heipo unleashes his anger!

21
00:01:15,070 --> 00:01:19,950
If you could just pee first,

22
00:01:18,190 --> 00:01:19,950
I CAN'T CONTROL IT LIKE THAT!!

23
00:01:19,980 --> 00:01:22,190
I can't do just one thing at a time

24
00:01:22,250 --> 00:01:23,750
Stop taking the piss!

25
00:01:23,770 --> 00:01:26,320
Ahh! It's coming out already

26
00:01:30,390 --> 00:01:31,850
Ahh I can't hold it in!

27
00:01:31,890 --> 00:01:35,120
My stomach hurts~!

28
00:01:35,960 --> 00:01:41,940
So, will Fujiwara be able to make it through this purification?

00:01:53,640 --> 00:01:57,390
It's been 8 hours since the start.

31
00:01:59,660 --> 00:02:04,990
Tired from all his talking, Po-chan falls asleep

32
00:02:05,470 --> 00:02:07,470
Is he really sleeping?

33
00:02:05,770 --> 00:02:08,770
He's snoring for real

34
00:02:08,470 --> 00:02:09,470
Amazing

35
00:02:09,770 --> 00:02:11,640
What a Tokyo-ite

36
00:02:12,170 --> 00:02:15,070
It's just shocking footage after shocking footage

37
00:02:19,950 --> 00:02:20,950
Sleep apnea

38
00:02:21,380 --> 00:02:23,920
That's sleep apnea right?

39
00:02:24,290 --> 00:02:26,290
Makes sense Fujiwara is scared

40
00:02:26,290 --> 00:02:28,750
Yeah I was a bit scared

41
00:02:27,000 --> 00:02:32,600
Po-chan's breathing can't be heard

42
00:02:29,130 --> 00:02:31,130
So scary

43
00:02:30,130 --> 00:02:32,720
He hasn't breathed yet

44
00:02:31,130 --> 00:02:32,720
Yeah he hasn't

45
00:02:45,480 --> 00:02:51,140
Fujiwara films Heipo with the camera

46
00:02:54,170 --> 00:02:56,680
This guy is really something

47
00:02:56,780 --> 00:03:00,130
He's sleeping with glasses and a pacifier

48
00:03:03,730 --> 00:03:04,730
What happened?

49
00:03:04,730 --> 00:03:10,930
Heipo waking up maybe?

50
00:03:04,830 --> 00:03:06,830
His sleep apnea again

51
00:03:06,930 --> 00:03:09,330
He might be having problems

52
00:03:10,830 --> 00:03:13,260
Are his eyes opening?

53
00:03:22,020 --> 00:03:23,610
He's smiling

54
00:03:22,810 --> 00:03:24,610
He's smiling

55
00:03:24,030 --> 00:03:26,710
He's smiling isn't he?

56
00:03:25,630 --> 00:03:26,970
He was smiling

57
00:03:27,170 --> 00:03:28,570
He's smiling

58
00:03:32,030 --> 00:03:34,110
Ehh for that long?

59
00:03:32,720 --> 00:03:37,340
He stopped breathing for 26 seconds

60
00:03:34,570 --> 00:03:36,570
26 seconds seems too long

61
00:03:36,670 --> 00:03:38,570
Too long

62
00:03:39,520 --> 00:03:45,850
Po-chan ...

63
00:03:42,680 --> 00:03:45,850
Sometimes you stop breathing

64
00:03:46,930 --> 00:03:49,730
You stop breathing sometimes

65
00:03:51,270 --> 00:03:52,770
I stopped breathing? For 1 minute?

66
00:03:52,770 --> 00:03:54,810
Well it wasn't 1 minute...

67
00:03:55,470 --> 00:04:02,940
Po-chan starts to ignore the no talking rule

68
00:03:56,630 --> 00:03:59,540
Yeah why is he ignoring the rules?

69
00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:03,690
Yeah, he's been talking normally since they came back

70
00:04:04,420 --> 00:04:06,420
Sleep apnea is ...

71
00:04:09,000 --> 00:04:10,420
He slept again!

72
00:04:09,000 --> 00:04:10,420
No way!

73
00:04:10,520 --> 00:04:12,520
This is too much

74
00:04:12,620 --> 00:04:13,620
This is too much!

75
00:04:13,920 --> 00:04:19,320
Heipo has fallen back asleep.

76
00:04:14,720 --> 00:04:17,560
This guy is actually no good

77
00:04:17,660 --> 00:04:19,560
I hate this guy!

78
00:04:24,270 --> 00:04:27,270
It's been 10 hours since the start.

79
00:04:27,370 --> 00:04:29,070
Fujiwara starts to look tired

80
00:04:29,170 --> 00:04:33,020
However there is no rest. Time for a new activity,

81
00:04:39,390 --> 00:04:44,670
Let's put Po-chan in the bath!

82
00:04:40,520 --> 00:04:43,120
Oh yeah, of course

83
00:04:42,260 --> 00:04:44,730
This is an essential one

84
00:04:44,720 --> 00:04:47,520
Alright Po-chan shall we enter the bath?

85
00:05:12,040 --> 00:05:17,690
In order to wash off today's tiredness, he puts Po-chan in the bath

86
00:05:28,560 --> 00:05:30,900
Po-chan just sit down real quick

87
00:05:29,820 --> 00:05:32,900
This honestly sensational!

88
00:05:31,520 --> 00:05:32,900
Just sit down nice and easy-

89
00:05:35,340 --> 00:05:37,340
I also-

90
00:05:36,440 --> 00:05:43,440
Hot! Wait it's hot!

91
00:05:45,680 --> 00:05:49,780
The water was too hot for baby Heipo

92
00:05:47,180 --> 00:05:49,780
I hate this! I hate this!

93
00:05:50,050 --> 00:05:52,920
What are we gonna do about this!

94
00:05:56,420 --> 00:06:00,620
Wait I can't do this - I'm scared!

95
00:05:57,620 --> 00:05:58,620
This is tiring

96
00:05:58,620 --> 00:05:59,820
This is tiring

97
00:06:00,720 --> 00:06:02,420
I'm gonna slip

98
00:06:15,550 --> 00:06:17,500
I'm scared

99
00:06:18,060 --> 00:06:24,380
Since Po-chan is scared, Fujiwara joins him

100
00:06:20,060 --> 00:06:22,060
He's saying "I'm scared"!

101
00:06:24,380 --> 00:06:27,290
We need to tell him off

102
00:06:34,320 --> 00:06:36,320
Okay okay, it's alright

103
00:06:36,420 --> 00:06:38,320
Po-chan, it's alright it's alright

104
00:06:41,100 --> 00:06:42,100
It's overflowing!

105
00:06:45,750 --> 00:06:47,950
Yeah that would overflow

106
00:06:48,000 --> 00:06:52,650
Since it's just 2 adults after all

107
00:06:53,310 --> 00:06:57,010
Po-chan I'm gonna clean your ears, come here a second

108
00:07:04,220 --> 00:07:06,530
Yeah, he doesn't have any kids

109
00:07:06,530 --> 00:07:07,940
This was my first time

110
00:07:07,730 --> 00:07:09,730
Welll I guess you can learn from this

111
00:07:11,440 --> 00:07:12,440
Alright alright

112
00:07:13,680 --> 00:07:15,970
Are you wearing a ring?

113
00:07:17,310 --> 00:07:19,470
Let's get out

114
00:07:25,000 --> 00:07:27,000
Okay Po-chan sit down sit down OK

115
00:07:38,370 --> 00:07:42,300
Fujiwara gently cleans Po-chan's body

116
00:07:40,720 --> 00:07:44,700
Yeah this part is not good. Wow right?

117
00:07:45,600 --> 00:07:48,000
Alright, this part!

118
00:07:48,260 --> 00:07:50,540
No way

119
00:07:49,600 --> 00:07:52,000
Alright Po-chan

120
00:07:53,400 --> 00:07:55,000
Alright

121
00:08:06,110 --> 00:08:08,110
Alright, alrighty, alright

122
00:08:08,830 --> 00:08:12,830
Fujiwara's never given a bath before

123
00:08:10,620 --> 00:08:14,260
Fujiwara manages to get the bathing done

124
00:08:14,560 --> 00:08:22,400
After this, Fujiwara will get Po-chan's body nice and dry

125
00:08:20,730 --> 00:08:22,400
This guy is actually no good

126
00:08:32,400 --> 00:08:34,000
This is just scary man

127
00:08:34,400 --> 00:08:36,400
What the hell are they doing?

128
00:08:47,400 --> 00:08:49,330
Just stop this already!

129
00:08:49,590 --> 00:08:51,860
What the hell!

130
00:08:55,260 --> 00:08:58,570
You're getting dressed first?

131
00:08:56,970 --> 00:09:00,000
That's not right

132
00:09:00,000 --> 00:09:02,000
I didn't wanna catch a cold

133
00:09:15,550 --> 00:09:16,850
Alright Po-chan

134
00:09:17,050 --> 00:09:20,350
Hmm, Fujiwara seems to be getting good at this

135
00:09:20,350 --> 00:09:22,150
I think so

136
00:09:23,360 --> 00:09:26,230
What are you idiots doing?

137
00:09:24,990 --> 00:09:32,470
Fujiwara's exhausted breathing continues

138
00:09:32,470 --> 00:09:34,470
He's huffing a lot

139
00:09:34,470 --> 00:09:36,470
Are you OK?

140
00:09:36,470 --> 00:09:39,470
I guess you learned what parenting is all about

141
00:09:38,810 --> 00:09:47,220
To keep Po-chan warm, he dresses him and dries his hair with a blowdryer

142
00:09:48,120 --> 00:09:50,890
Hot!

143
00:09:48,390 --> 00:09:50,890
Hot!

144
00:09:48,520 --> 00:09:50,890
Hot!

145
00:09:48,720 --> 00:09:50,890
Hot!

146
00:09:51,590 --> 00:09:54,760
Hot!

147
00:09:51,720 --> 00:09:54,760
Hot!

148
00:09:51,990 --> 00:09:54,760
Hot!

149
00:09:52,740 --> 00:09:54,760
Hot!

150
00:09:53,320 --> 00:09:54,760
Really Hot!

151
00:09:57,200 --> 00:09:58,830
Hot!

152
00:09:57,430 --> 00:09:58,830
Hot!

153
00:09:58,530 --> 00:09:58,830
Hot!

154
00:09:58,830 --> 00:10:01,030
Hot!

155
00:09:59,130 --> 00:10:01,030
Hot!

156
00:09:59,870 --> 00:10:01,030
Hot!

157
00:10:01,960 --> 00:10:03,030
It's ok.

158
00:10:03,540 --> 00:10:05,100
It's too hot!

159
00:10:09,140 --> 00:10:11,570
Are you warmed up?

160
00:10:12,620 --> 00:10:15,620
Alright turn over, just a bit more

161
00:10:24,150 --> 00:10:26,390
So warm

162
00:10:33,700 --> 00:10:40,000
Let's suck out Po-chan's nose mucus with that nasal aspirator over there

163
00:10:40,000 --> 00:10:42,000
This one sounds really gross

164
00:10:41,000 --> 00:10:43,550
Suck out your nose mucus?

165
00:10:44,550 --> 00:10:54,920
Put the tube inside the baby's nostril, and suck out the mucus with your moth

166
00:10:46,920 --> 00:10:50,420
Eh what is this? Eh suck out with this?

167
00:10:51,080 --> 00:10:53,440
He's never done this before after all

168
00:10:56,440 --> 00:10:58,010
Seriously?

169
00:11:12,000 --> 00:11:15,830
Keep going! It's a purification, so keep going!

170
00:11:13,970 --> 00:11:16,730
This is not good!

171
00:11:20,170 --> 00:11:21,740
This sucks

172
00:11:21,850 --> 00:11:22,720
ohh this sucks!

173
00:11:23,940 --> 00:11:26,890
I can't do this...

174
00:11:31,920 --> 00:11:36,920
Let's use an earpick to clean his ears

175
00:11:37,420 --> 00:11:40,540
I have to pick his ears too?...

176
00:11:40,650 --> 00:11:42,450
Ear pick...

177
00:11:42,450 --> 00:11:43,880
Yeah it's scary kind of

178
00:11:48,150 --> 00:11:50,150
Po-chan

179
00:11:56,300 --> 00:11:58,920
That's not safe

180
00:11:57,350 --> 00:11:58,920
Ow!

181
00:11:57,480 --> 00:11:58,920
Ow!

182
00:11:57,680 --> 00:11:58,920
Ow!

183
00:11:57,880 --> 00:11:58,920
Ow!

184
00:11:58,160 --> 00:11:58,920
Ow!

185
00:11:58,920 --> 00:12:00,920
Sorry, sorry Po-chan

186
00:11:59,420 --> 00:12:02,610
Ow! Ow! Ow!

187
00:12:02,760 --> 00:12:04,760
Owowowowowow

188
00:12:07,700 --> 00:12:11,570
Look at that face...

189
00:12:11,960 --> 00:12:14,270
Look we got a lot out-

190
00:12:14,960 --> 00:12:17,620
You shouldn't wretch like that

191
00:12:17,620 --> 00:12:19,820
What the hell!

192
00:12:22,950 --> 00:12:30,980
After the break - Heipo's anger is unleashed!

193
00:12:22,980 --> 00:12:28,540
Spare me! I'm not a man in his 20s or 30s!

194
00:12:31,480 --> 00:12:35,820
He's the lowest of the low

195
00:12:36,600 --> 00:12:40,200
It's been 11 hours since the start.

196
00:12:36,600 --> 00:12:40,200
9:30PM

197
00:12:42,570 --> 00:12:44,520
He sure sleeps a lot!

198
00:12:44,470 --> 00:12:46,870
Po-chan falls asleep again

199
00:12:59,570 --> 00:13:02,550
Po-chan farts in his sleep

200
00:13:01,540 --> 00:13:02,550
This guy...

201
00:13:03,010 --> 00:13:06,740
He's the lowest of the low

202
00:13:11,860 --> 00:13:15,630
It's time to go to the bedroom and go to sleep

203
00:13:16,720 --> 00:13:19,460
Let's go to the bedroom

204
00:13:34,880 --> 00:13:36,010
Have a good night.

205
00:13:36,150 --> 00:13:36,760
Yes.

206
00:13:37,080 --> 00:13:39,320
Don't say "yes"!

207
00:13:54,970 --> 00:14:00,570
The horn makes Po-chan panic

208
00:14:03,580 --> 00:14:06,380
I'm lonely...

209
00:14:06,380 --> 00:14:08,380
Lonely?

210
00:14:08,880 --> 00:14:11,150
What emotion?

211
00:14:11,150 --> 00:14:17,650
Time Until Lights Off

212
00:14:14,150 --> 00:14:16,750
Will he be alright? I'm the one who's scared

213
00:14:18,210 --> 00:14:21,350
Waaah!

214
00:14:19,820 --> 00:14:21,350
Aaa Mouuu

215
00:14:22,490 --> 00:14:24,600
Aaa!

216
00:14:23,790 --> 00:14:24,600
Wawawawa!

217
00:14:25,870 --> 00:14:34,570
There were more setups planned for Po-chan, but they were put on pause because of an incident

218
00:14:39,100 --> 00:14:41,540
What am I supposed to do, there's not enough room

219
00:14:47,980 --> 00:14:50,250
Can't sleep Po-chan?

220
00:14:50,350 --> 00:14:52,250
You were screaming

221
00:14:50,990 --> 00:14:57,130
In order to fix the problem, Po-chan is moved to the living room for now

222
00:15:01,300 --> 00:15:04,070
He's just walking now

223
00:15:04,400 --> 00:15:05,870
Can I start talking already?

224
00:15:05,970 --> 00:15:07,270
I'm tired!

225
00:15:06,880 --> 00:15:11,080
He's decided that's spot is where he belongs

226
00:15:07,820 --> 00:15:11,080
More complaining I guess.

227
00:15:09,080 --> 00:15:11,110
Yeah, he returned to the same spot

228
00:15:11,110 --> 00:15:15,070
I think we're almost done though

229
00:15:13,650 --> 00:15:15,070
Give me a break!

230
00:15:15,110 --> 00:15:19,550
That's cause you're in your 20s-30s. A young man has more stamina!

231
00:15:19,960 --> 00:15:26,660
Po-chan snaps at Fujiwara

232
00:15:20,000 --> 00:15:23,090
I'm sorry but,

233
00:15:20,000 --> 00:15:23,090
I'm sorry you had to put up with that

234
00:15:23,160 --> 00:15:26,660
How does this end? That's what I don't know

235
00:15:26,920 --> 00:15:28,960
Just endlessley stumbling

236
00:15:30,260 --> 00:15:34,260
This is not going on until the morning. What should we do?

237
00:15:35,280 --> 00:15:37,000
No idea what to do!

238
00:15:37,480 --> 00:15:43,310
Po-chan complains in order to be heard by the staff

239
00:15:39,810 --> 00:15:41,540
My head is spinning right now

240
00:15:43,950 --> 00:15:47,280
I said my head is spinning and still the staff won't help me

241
00:15:46,410 --> 00:15:47,410
Yes

242
00:15:47,300 --> 00:15:50,380
They just say "do it do it" I'm sick of it

243
00:15:51,010 --> 00:15:54,720
I absolutely don't trust staff like that

244
00:15:55,330 --> 00:15:56,590
He's really mad

245
00:15:56,890 --> 00:16:00,110
I wonder when Gaki No Tsukai became like this

246
00:16:00,760 --> 00:16:03,630
Now he's got a claim against the show

247
00:16:03,660 --> 00:16:05,630
This is nonsense

248
00:16:05,630 --> 00:16:14,540
In order to relieve Fujiwara from this responsibility, a young director enters the room and conveys Director Komurasaki's instructions

249
00:16:17,640 --> 00:16:18,810
Enough alright

250
00:16:18,810 --> 00:16:20,850
I'm so damn tired

251
00:16:20,870 --> 00:16:22,780
He's the focus of this,

252
00:16:22,810 --> 00:16:25,350
I'm not really that relevant

253
00:16:25,470 --> 00:16:30,320
This is the first time I think, like seriously I'm going faint

254
00:16:28,990 --> 00:16:30,320
I'm not like a young man

255
00:16:31,520 --> 00:16:33,700
I need breaks sometimes

256
00:16:34,230 --> 00:16:37,610
We really are almost done, I'm sorry, almost finished

257
00:16:37,610 --> 00:16:39,500
I said I don't wanna do this anymore

258
00:16:39,840 --> 00:16:44,500
The young director leaves to consult with Komurasaki

259
00:16:41,400 --> 00:16:43,400
He just told you it's the end

260
00:16:47,660 --> 00:16:49,670
This guy can't move?

261
00:16:49,970 --> 00:16:53,980
3 Minutes Go By

262
00:16:51,480 --> 00:16:53,980
What the hell is this?

263
00:16:54,540 --> 00:16:59,380
It's time for the unsatisfied Heipo to resume filming

264
00:17:03,550 --> 00:17:05,850
So just enter the bedroom for now,

265
00:17:05,880 --> 00:17:09,950
We just need you to scream once after the power cut. After that we'll be done.

266
00:17:10,520 --> 00:17:11,820
Just don't lie to me anymore

267
00:17:11,860 --> 00:17:12,990
Seriously!

268
00:17:12,820 --> 00:17:13,820
Ok thanks.

269
00:17:13,860 --> 00:17:19,560
You've pushed me this far even though I'm so tired
I'm worried there's still more left

270
00:17:19,560 --> 00:17:20,960
What the hell is this

271
00:17:20,960 --> 00:17:22,960
He's bringing up a lot of stuff

272
00:17:20,960 --> 00:17:22,960
What does he even mean

273
00:17:25,960 --> 00:17:27,060
Good work today

274
00:17:30,310 --> 00:17:32,680
I'm so tired

275
00:17:34,550 --> 00:17:38,140
Should we go to sleep again? It's almost over

276
00:17:38,590 --> 00:17:44,520
With the incident resolved, Heipo is brought into the bedroom again

277
00:17:45,240 --> 00:17:55,740
When we return, Heipo flips out!!

278
00:17:56,400 --> 00:18:00,100
Should we go to sleep again? It's almost over

279
00:18:01,330 --> 00:18:06,380
With the incident resolved, Heipo is brought into the bedroom again

280
00:18:14,290 --> 00:18:17,290
Ow Ow Ow

281
00:18:16,290 --> 00:18:17,290
It hurts?

282
00:18:19,930 --> 00:18:23,230
Po-chan I'm leaving the light on

283
00:18:23,800 --> 00:18:26,370
I wonder what hurt

284
00:18:29,740 --> 00:18:31,770
Well I guess a lot happened

285
00:18:31,500 --> 00:18:33,830
He has a bad shoulder right?

286
00:18:31,770 --> 00:18:35,840
Heipo's "50 year old shoulder" hurts

287
00:18:33,340 --> 00:18:35,140
50 year old shoulder?

288
00:18:37,050 --> 00:18:43,690
Time to Prank

289
00:18:45,020 --> 00:18:46,890
AHHHHHHHHHHHH!

290
00:18:48,830 --> 00:18:50,060
AHHHHHHH!!

291
00:18:51,530 --> 00:19:00,300
Heipo overreacts in order to finish early

292
00:19:01,340 --> 00:19:08,050
Time to Prank.

293
00:19:12,820 --> 00:19:14,180
Heipo is quite scared.

294
00:19:14,210 --> 00:19:15,990
AHH!

295
00:19:14,550 --> 00:19:15,990
AHH!

296
00:19:14,710 --> 00:19:15,990
AHH!

297
00:19:14,890 --> 00:19:15,990
AHH!

298
00:19:16,020 --> 00:19:19,220
AHH!

299
00:19:16,850 --> 00:19:19,220
Alright I get it! I knew you were lying!

300
00:19:22,230 --> 00:19:25,260
Listen!

301
00:19:23,450 --> 00:19:25,260
No!

302
00:19:26,520 --> 00:19:28,370
Please!

303
00:19:29,590 --> 00:19:31,970
I'm actually done!

304
00:19:30,000 --> 00:19:36,040
The Complex (2013)

305
00:19:36,740 --> 00:19:41,310
Heipo panics to open the door

306
00:19:43,940 --> 00:19:45,620
STOP MESSING AROUND

307
00:19:45,640 --> 00:19:47,910
I said please didn't I?!

308
00:19:47,910 --> 00:19:55,020
Komu! (Director)

309
00:19:49,740 --> 00:19:55,020
I don't want to be friends with you anymore!

310
00:19:55,030 --> 00:19:57,730
This is gonna raise my blood pressure isn't it?

311
00:19:59,250 --> 00:20:01,020
Please spare me

312
00:20:02,660 --> 00:20:05,170
We're done aren't we!

313
00:20:05,020 --> 00:20:07,020
Amazing ...

314
00:20:06,670 --> 00:20:08,170
Please

315
00:20:09,540 --> 00:20:11,500
This has been a long one hasn't it?

316
00:20:10,830 --> 00:20:13,210
Good, it's good that it's too long

317
00:20:11,500 --> 00:20:13,910
Please...

318
00:20:13,210 --> 00:20:16,470
It's funnier if it's too long

319
00:20:14,580 --> 00:20:18,740
Who is it? Ah I head something

320
00:20:16,570 --> 00:20:21,740
Time until smoke comes out

321
00:20:25,070 --> 00:20:28,890
Enough of this stuff, it's not my batsu game!

322
00:20:28,890 --> 00:20:30,120
AHHHH!

323
00:20:30,150 --> 00:20:33,220
What?! What?! What is this?!

324
00:20:34,030 --> 00:20:36,570
You're going overboard

325
00:20:36,960 --> 00:20:39,940
Just end this, please just-

326
00:20:40,200 --> 00:20:42,870
That's gotta be enough

327
00:20:46,140 --> 00:20:47,780
I hurt my shoulder

328
00:20:48,310 --> 00:20:51,680
Everything about this old man is hilarious

329
00:20:58,220 --> 00:20:59,990
Why did you lock it?!

330
00:21:00,330 --> 00:21:01,670
Fujiwara?

331
00:21:05,150 --> 00:21:06,150
Fujiwara?

332
00:21:13,730 --> 00:21:16,470
That's it

333
00:21:14,730 --> 00:21:16,130
Yes, rest please

334
00:21:16,730 --> 00:21:19,230
That was too much, I said-

335
00:21:20,530 --> 00:21:22,730
He's going back to that spot?

336
00:21:23,310 --> 00:21:26,320
It's not funny, please

337
00:21:27,140 --> 00:21:29,290
Just wrap up filming, that was a lot just now

338
00:21:29,290 --> 00:21:31,000
That just now,

339
00:21:31,810 --> 00:21:34,470
Just spare me, that's it!

340
00:21:35,360 --> 00:21:36,830
I can't do this anymore

341
00:21:36,110 --> 00:21:36,830
Yes?

342
00:21:38,170 --> 00:21:41,900
You're just a liar! You said that wasn't a setup!

343
00:21:41,900 --> 00:21:44,530
I don't know if it'll make it on air, but that shit is [!@$!@$]

344
00:21:45,330 --> 00:21:46,330
Do you agree?

345
00:21:50,000 --> 00:21:51,610
I've got "50 year old shoulder"

346
00:21:51,620 --> 00:21:57,520
It just snapped and fixed itself, just now

347
00:21:57,740 --> 00:21:59,520
What the hell is wrong with this guy!

348
00:22:00,880 --> 00:22:06,180
With that, Fujiwara's baby raising day was over

349
00:22:06,280 --> 00:22:10,500
It's not Fujiwara, but Heipo that pisses me off

350
00:22:09,880 --> 00:22:10,900
What's with that guy

351
00:22:10,990 --> 00:22:13,830
He turns into Takeda Tetsuya sometimes

352
00:22:13,940 --> 00:22:15,940
"I don't wanna be friends with you!"

353
00:22:16,000 --> 00:22:18,650
It's like that one line of his.

354
00:22:18,840 --> 00:22:20,540
What's with that?

355
00:22:23,330 --> 00:22:28,220
We've still got that individual left, lets bring him in

356
00:22:28,420 --> 00:22:29,220
Come in!

357
00:22:33,540 --> 00:22:36,580
Sekai no Heipo (The Global Heipo)

358
00:22:36,580 --> 00:22:39,310
What'd you think of the video?

359
00:22:38,250 --> 00:22:39,700
What'd you think?

360
00:22:39,700 --> 00:22:43,330
It was supposed to be Fujiwara-kun's batsu game right?

361
00:22:43,330 --> 00:22:46,830
Why did I have to be subjected to this?

362
00:22:45,100 --> 00:22:49,270
I do think that is a bit unfortunate,

363
00:22:49,270 --> 00:22:54,200
But, I guess, it's cause it's funny, isn't it?

364
00:22:54,550 --> 00:22:56,730
Every single thing was hilarious

365
00:22:56,200 --> 00:22:59,010
You came up with some great quotes too

366
00:22:57,070 --> 00:22:58,010
All: Yes.

367
00:22:57,570 --> 00:22:59,070
You did

368
00:22:59,070 --> 00:23:00,530
I hated it,

369
00:23:00,530 --> 00:23:05,230
Ghosts have been working on Gaki for 25 years right?

370
00:23:05,230 --> 00:23:07,180
Ghosts!

371
00:23:09,650 --> 00:23:14,080
I don't understand. Ghosts have been working for 25 years?

372
00:23:14,680 --> 00:23:18,060
I want to stop the Ghosts!

373
00:23:18,100 --> 00:23:23,000
I think we better stop then

374
00:23:18,400 --> 00:23:23,000
No more ghosts.

375
00:23:23,230 --> 00:23:26,000
It was hilarious, really

376
00:23:26,000 --> 00:23:30,000
Oh, yes ... Ah ... oh yes.

377
00:23:29,430 --> 00:23:31,130
What happened?

378
00:23:30,050 --> 00:23:32,000
Sorry I sort of peed just now

379
00:23:32,150 --> 00:23:37,220
Heipo continues his explanation

380
00:23:37,290 --> 00:23:39,740
You peed now? You peed just now?

381
00:23:38,420 --> 00:23:41,380
Just a little bit

382
00:23:41,410 --> 00:23:43,380
I was a bit nervous

383
00:23:43,380 --> 00:23:49,420
You were nervous? But normally you can't pee when you're nervous, you've got it backwards
