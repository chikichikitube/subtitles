1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Yujiro Ishihara

2
00:00:04,350 --> 00:00:06,390
He's going at max tension right away

3
00:00:06,390 --> 00:00:16,630
Aired last week, Music Memory Drive!

4
00:00:11,750 --> 00:00:13,400
He's singing with his chest

5
00:00:17,450 --> 00:00:26,600
They record nostalgic songs they sing acapella on casettes, and then drive while listening to them

6
00:00:27,200 --> 00:00:30,000
Do we have to listen to this?

7
00:00:28,700 --> 00:00:30,250
Yeah

8
00:00:30,250 --> 00:00:33,800
That's what this episode is about

9
00:00:36,300 --> 00:00:39,150
Ah there it is

10
00:00:42,500 --> 00:00:45,000
His voice really tapers off

11
00:00:46,400 --> 00:00:49,750
They seemed to have a lot of trouble singing their favourite songs

12
00:00:54,600 --> 00:00:58,550
Gross!

13
00:00:55,450 --> 00:00:58,050
It's kinda...

14
00:00:58,800 --> 00:01:01,400
Something to sing before dying

15
00:01:04,250 --> 00:01:06,450
It's like a buddhist chant

16
00:01:05,000 --> 00:01:08,450
It really is, why do you sing so darkly

17
00:01:07,350 --> 00:01:09,000
Eh but it's like this

18
00:01:09,000 --> 00:01:15,700
"Because we live in a digital world, listen to my song in analog!" Music Memory Drive Start!

19
00:01:16,050 --> 00:01:22,450
I was thinking, for this series, I think someone has to play Seiko-chan (Matsuda Seiko)

20
00:01:22,450 --> 00:01:26,350
If we don't have someone like Matsuda Seiko, we can't really finish

21
00:01:25,900 --> 00:01:28,050
I see

22
00:01:29,200 --> 00:01:31,850
If we get Seiko-chan, things are gonna change a lot

23
00:01:31,850 --> 00:01:38,150
No Yama-chan, he means the real singer

24
00:01:36,500 --> 00:01:40,150
Did you think he meant from our casettes today?

25
00:01:40,750 --> 00:01:44,150
He was smirking and checking his casettes

26
00:01:44,150 --> 00:01:47,000
"Ah I'll play this"

27
00:01:45,900 --> 00:01:47,350
Oh I see

28
00:01:47,350 --> 00:01:51,150
What an idiot...

29
00:01:49,900 --> 00:01:51,650
That's not it

30
00:01:51,650 --> 00:01:56,400
Cause all we've heard is old men singing right?

31
00:01:56,400 --> 00:02:00,350
Yama-chan, how about you put one in

32
00:01:58,700 --> 00:02:02,500
I'll go with this one, not sure what it is

33
00:02:12,200 --> 00:02:14,300
That's why

34
00:02:13,450 --> 00:02:15,550
That's why he was smiling

35
00:02:14,850 --> 00:02:16,800
Yeah, that's why

36
00:02:16,800 --> 00:02:21,500
Like "Oh yeah, I got that card in my deck"

37
00:02:30,800 --> 00:02:33,350
He is into it at least

38
00:02:31,750 --> 00:02:34,150
That's true

39
00:02:33,350 --> 00:02:35,900
He's got the right spirit

40
00:02:38,200 --> 00:02:40,250
I get it

41
00:02:39,050 --> 00:02:44,500
Normally if you sing this you'd look like a dumbass. So it's nice we had this episode

42
00:02:44,550 --> 00:02:48,550
That's true

43
00:02:45,600 --> 00:02:49,450
Yeah, it's good for Yamasaki

44
00:02:53,250 --> 00:02:55,850
He excels at this doesn't he?

45
00:02:55,050 --> 00:02:57,350
I think so

46
00:03:01,650 --> 00:03:04,600
Yamasaki excels at this, after all

47
00:03:05,150 --> 00:03:07,800
I got it now, after all this time

48
00:03:08,200 --> 00:03:10,700
He shines when it comes to this kind of thing

49
00:03:09,300 --> 00:03:14,450
Yeah, if you leave at home alone and ask him to do something

50
00:03:14,450 --> 00:03:16,450
I see

51
00:03:15,050 --> 00:03:18,650
And Tanaka is just so goddamn depressing

52
00:03:18,850 --> 00:03:20,450
So, DaHama

53
00:03:20,950 --> 00:03:22,950
DaHama-san if you will

54
00:03:22,950 --> 00:03:29,650
I should've sung with my chest like Yama-chan

55
00:03:29,900 --> 00:03:32,500
So, DaHama, the second song

56
00:03:32,500 --> 00:03:34,900
Last one was Sakurada Junko-san right?

57
00:03:33,950 --> 00:03:38,200
I guess singing a woman's song is different isn't it?

58
00:03:38,200 --> 00:03:41,100
This is a man's song

59
00:03:45,650 --> 00:03:48,600
Is he in the bathroom?

60
00:03:46,950 --> 00:03:48,900
Are you in the bathroom?

61
00:03:49,850 --> 00:03:51,600
He's totally in the bathroom

62
00:03:52,050 --> 00:03:54,850
He should change location

63
00:03:53,280 --> 00:03:58,050
Otoko no yujio sebangou 3 - Yujiro Ishihara

64
00:03:53,500 --> 00:03:56,950
You can kinda hear the echo of the bathroom

65
00:03:56,950 --> 00:04:02,000
He wanted to sing better

66
00:04:02,000 --> 00:04:04,350
Is this Nagashima Shigeo?

67
00:04:04,350 --> 00:04:06,350
Sebangou 3?

68
00:04:09,900 --> 00:04:12,400
It sounds like Nagashima Shigeo-san

69
00:04:18,350 --> 00:04:20,600
What is this?

70
00:04:20,800 --> 00:04:23,800
I thought it was Enka or something

71
00:04:22,200 --> 00:04:25,300
No no, it's Ishihara Yujiro-san

72
00:04:26,820 --> 00:04:28,800
Enough of this song!

73
00:04:28,800 --> 00:04:32,300
You wanted to play this in front of [@!@#!@] right?

74
00:04:32,300 --> 00:04:33,850
Are you dumb

75
00:04:33,850 --> 00:04:38,600
Ishihara Yujiro-san is covering Nagashima Shigeo

76
00:04:39,400 --> 00:04:42,400
The song called "Otoko no yujio sebangou 3"

77
00:04:42,400 --> 00:04:48,800
"sEbaNgoU sAn~" - I've never heard that before, and I don't want to hear it again

78
00:04:49,350 --> 00:04:54,000
What the hell is this? So gross. Creepy!

79
00:04:54,000 --> 00:04:57,250
Endo right?

80
00:04:55,050 --> 00:04:58,000
Oh yes, this one

81
00:05:02,100 --> 00:05:05,200
He did sing by himself at home

82
00:05:03,800 --> 00:05:06,050
The best one maybe

83
00:05:06,250 --> 00:05:08,600
I was able to sing loud

84
00:05:16,000 --> 00:05:20,150
Listen here, Endo... Are you messing around?

85
00:05:16,600 --> 00:05:18,850
It didn't sound like this!

86
00:05:19,300 --> 00:05:21,800
He's messing about, He's messing about

87
00:05:20,650 --> 00:05:23,100
I'm not at all!

88
00:05:22,050 --> 00:05:24,800
No no, this is just strange

89
00:05:22,890 --> 00:05:30,510
Yukiguni - Yoshi Ikuzo

90
00:05:24,800 --> 00:05:26,550
It's kinda

91
00:05:26,550 --> 00:05:28,750
Like he's mocking the singer

92
00:05:27,550 --> 00:05:32,400
No no, I respect this song a lot, Yukiguni

93
00:05:29,050 --> 00:05:31,550
Are you mocking it?

94
00:05:32,700 --> 00:05:35,750
He's singing this while lying on his side

95
00:05:35,850 --> 00:05:40,150
I was singing properly, right in front of the table

96
00:05:36,450 --> 00:05:38,450
He really is

97
00:05:42,950 --> 00:05:44,950
He made a joke of this

98
00:05:43,650 --> 00:05:45,900
He made a joke of this

99
00:05:45,900 --> 00:05:48,150
Endo you gotta take this seriosuly

100
00:05:48,150 --> 00:05:51,300
But I am! Is this messing about?

101
00:05:48,300 --> 00:05:51,400
You really can't mess around like this

102
00:05:51,300 --> 00:05:53,600
Is this messing about?

103
00:05:51,840 --> 00:05:53,600
Yeah

104
00:05:52,630 --> 00:06:07,700
Chasing her, chasing her, chasing her ... Yukiguni

105
00:05:56,300 --> 00:05:58,900
This is bad

106
00:05:57,500 --> 00:05:59,150
Seriously?

107
00:06:04,700 --> 00:06:07,200
If you do it like that you're finished

108
00:06:07,800 --> 00:06:09,750
Is this messing about?

109
00:06:08,950 --> 00:06:11,850
Yeah, you said "Yukiguri"

110
00:06:10,650 --> 00:06:13,450
I didn't say Yukiguri. I said Yukiguni

111
00:06:13,920 --> 00:06:19,990
Downtown no Gaki no Tsukai ya Arahende!!

112

00:06:20,660 --> 00:06:25,830
Listen to my singing voice!
Nostalgic Song Drive!

114
00:06:29,950 --> 00:06:38,450
In this episode, the 5 will drive along as they listen to songs they sung A cappella and recorded onto cassette tapes

115
00:06:38,450 --> 00:06:39,900
That's one strong voice!

116
00:06:39,900 --> 00:06:42,150
He really got us with this one

117
00:06:43,450 --> 00:06:45,850
So, what will the next song be?

118
00:06:46,400 --> 00:06:48,250
Was I really messing about?

119
00:06:47,250 --> 00:06:49,250
Yeah you were

120
00:06:48,450 --> 00:06:54,650
I'm not exactly trying to rank them right now, but this is definitely the worst one

121
00:06:52,900 --> 00:06:56,200
Really?

122
00:06:55,200 --> 00:06:57,700
You don't get a single point

123
00:06:58,100 --> 00:07:02,750
Oh crap. I still have more here, can I continue?

124
00:07:02,850 --> 00:07:06,750
Yeah you better hurry up and continue, you gotta erase the last one

125
00:07:06,750 --> 00:07:10,000
A proper one please

126
00:07:07,900 --> 00:07:09,600
A proper one?

127
00:07:09,900 --> 00:07:13,250
I'm not messing about at all

128
00:07:10,400 --> 00:07:12,850
A head to head battle

129
00:07:14,600 --> 00:07:25,250
If it's with you, I don't mind dying anytime

130
00:07:18,930 --> 00:07:24,100
Tokyo - Yashiki Takajin

131
00:07:21,400 --> 00:07:24,100
Takajin-san?

132
00:07:29,360 --> 00:07:33,680
He's mocking this one a bit too

133
00:07:30,480 --> 00:07:34,520
He is kind of messing about

134
00:07:40,680 --> 00:07:42,880
See

135
00:07:41,400 --> 00:07:43,560
This is just how he sings

136
00:07:43,680 --> 00:07:46,660
You shouldn't try and copy his singing style

137
00:07:45,680 --> 00:07:48,360
Copy? But,

138
00:07:48,360 --> 00:07:51,280
I'm not trying to copy him-

139
00:07:50,080 --> 00:07:53,120
You could've sung with your own style

140
00:07:53,560 --> 00:07:55,550
Why are you trying to imitate him?

141
00:07:55,600 --> 00:07:58,590
You are trying to imitate him

142
00:08:04,240 --> 00:08:06,320
Well of course

143
00:08:08,240 --> 00:08:09,960
Seriously?

144
00:08:09,960 --> 00:08:11,240
You can't do that

145
00:08:10,600 --> 00:08:12,640
That's not on?

146
00:08:12,800 --> 00:08:14,360
This makes no sense

147
00:08:13,240 --> 00:08:15,040
A serious one

148
00:08:14,320 --> 00:08:15,940
It was a serious one

149
00:08:19,720 --> 00:08:21,840
So somber all of a sudden

150
00:08:21,840 --> 00:08:23,240
It got so somber so quickly

151
00:08:23,240 --> 00:08:24,960
So dark!

152
00:08:24,120 --> 00:08:26,960
It's even more somber than his last song

153
00:08:24,510 --> 00:08:31,660
Nagori Yuki - Iruka

154
00:08:26,040 --> 00:08:27,160
Right?

155
00:08:27,160 --> 00:08:29,320
This is so dark

156
00:08:29,320 --> 00:08:34,680
Then wasn't Tokyo a better song?

157
00:08:32,960 --> 00:08:34,680
What is this

158
00:08:34,680 --> 00:08:36,680
It's not dark! It's this type of song

159
00:08:36,680 --> 00:08:38,560
No no

160
00:08:37,760 --> 00:08:39,200
But...

161
00:08:39,200 --> 00:08:40,880
Your voice is gone

162
00:08:40,040 --> 00:08:42,160
Exactly, exactly

163
00:08:41,040 --> 00:08:44,560
My voice is gone you say...but it's that type of song

164
00:08:44,560 --> 00:08:46,320
No it's a bit more-

165
00:08:45,000 --> 00:08:47,920
It's a song for when you break up

166
00:08:47,920 --> 00:08:51,880
You gotta let your voice out little more, sing a little louder

167
00:08:53,000 --> 00:08:55,460
This guy sucks huh

168
00:08:54,400 --> 00:08:55,960
Of course Hamada said that

169
00:08:56,520 --> 00:08:59,560
Of course Hamada will say that

170
00:08:58,520 --> 00:09:02,630
He does suck, I'm sorry, Matsumoto-san...

171
00:09:02,630 --> 00:09:04,260
Matsumoto-san fucking sucks!

172
00:09:04,640 --> 00:09:07,640
I'm sorry, I'm sorry, but,

173
00:09:05,240 --> 00:09:07,720
I don't suck!

174
00:09:07,720 --> 00:09:10,480
I'm not a bad singer at all

175
00:09:10,880 --> 00:09:14,360
I'm thinking of releasing a cover album

176
00:09:15,360 --> 00:09:18,280
I just don't want to, for real

177
00:09:18,760 --> 00:09:21,800
A cover album, for Iruka?

178
00:09:22,560 --> 00:09:26,400
Matsumoto got told he sucks, and is very displeased

179
00:09:26,400 --> 00:09:29,840
Next, Tanaka will play his nostalgic song

180
00:09:29,840 --> 00:09:33,760
I think the tempo is good, my voice is strong too

181
00:09:30,760 --> 00:09:32,240
Are you confident?

182
00:09:32,240 --> 00:09:33,840
Alright

183
00:09:34,840 --> 00:09:36,440
I'm confident about this

184
00:09:43,840 --> 00:09:47,600
That was a tricky bit, you could've burst your head from singing that fast

185
00:09:52,880 --> 00:09:55,440
Was your wife about to get back home?

186
00:09:56,880 --> 00:10:01,040
I love this song, I had to sing it

187
00:09:57,890 --> 00:10:05,200
Darling - Sawada Kenji

188
00:10:06,320 --> 00:10:08,320
You're kind of off key

189
00:10:08,320 --> 00:10:10,040
Really?

190
00:10:09,320 --> 00:10:12,120
The ending is always off key

191
00:10:14,240 --> 00:10:16,680
This is Julie right?

192
00:10:19,840 --> 00:10:22,040
I'm singing strongly here right?

193
00:10:24,880 --> 00:10:27,040
So messy

194
00:10:25,920 --> 00:10:27,880
Really?

195
00:10:28,720 --> 00:10:32,920
What is that...
so creepy!

196
00:10:34,720 --> 00:10:36,400
You're making fun of Julie right?

197
00:10:35,720 --> 00:10:38,920
I'm not! I'm not!

198
00:10:37,240 --> 00:10:39,840
So gross, this is so gross

199
00:10:39,840 --> 00:10:43,360
I think my song from earlier was better

200
00:10:42,200 --> 00:10:44,560
The Takajin song was better

201
00:10:43,880 --> 00:10:45,040
Really?

202
00:10:45,040 --> 00:10:48,000
It was better

203
00:10:45,800 --> 00:10:48,840
Takajin-san just can't sing like that

204
00:10:52,800 --> 00:10:55,700
Even if you tell an episode about your memory we wont listen

205
00:10:54,800 --> 00:10:57,400
Yeah it seems we don't do episodes anymore

206
00:10:57,400 --> 00:11:00,800
It's just become a singing contest

207
00:10:59,480 --> 00:11:01,200
That's fine

208
00:11:01,200 --> 00:11:03,840
That's true

209
00:11:02,800 --> 00:11:04,960
This one is a home run

210
00:11:04,960 --> 00:11:06,240
Please play it

211
00:11:06,240 --> 00:11:10,920
I wanna redo this, properly

212
00:11:09,320 --> 00:11:11,680
I wanna redo this

213
00:11:11,920 --> 00:11:15,080
I can't stand being called somber so much

214
00:11:19,680 --> 00:11:21,800
You're messing about!

215
00:11:20,330 --> 00:11:26,130
Koibito Shiken - Matsumoto Chieko

216
00:11:20,800 --> 00:11:24,520
It's Koibito Shiken! By Matsumoto Chieko!

217
00:11:24,520 --> 00:11:26,680
You're definitley messing about!

218
00:11:25,640 --> 00:11:27,240
I'm not!

219
00:11:27,240 --> 00:11:31,380
That's not how you sing, you're messing about!

220
00:11:30,080 --> 00:11:32,200
It was so cute though!

221
00:11:32,200 --> 00:11:34,400
For real, it was so cute!

222
00:11:33,400 --> 00:11:38,280
"It was so cute though" he says ... It wasn't cute at all! Gross!

223
00:11:38,480 --> 00:11:41,320
It's not about being cute anyways

224
00:11:41,720 --> 00:11:44,680
This is the one that shows my singing skills off the best

225
00:11:44,680 --> 00:11:46,600
Oh yes play that one

226
00:11:46,600 --> 00:11:48,380
You thought I sucked

227
00:11:48,880 --> 00:11:51,000
This is also barely acceptable

228
00:11:51,400 --> 00:11:53,440
You're off right from the start

229
00:11:54,040 --> 00:11:56,320
Your voice is so shaky

230
00:11:56,600 --> 00:11:59,900
I wanted to get this one done quickly

231
00:12:00,240 --> 00:12:03,520
I couldn't

232
00:12:05,120 --> 00:12:07,280
My voice is steady here, listen

233
00:12:08,080 --> 00:12:09,760
We have to listen till the end, OK?

234
00:12:09,880 --> 00:12:12,680
You're gonna make us listen to the end

235
00:12:14,280 --> 00:12:16,320
Tanaka!

236
00:12:15,360 --> 00:12:17,320
Fucking sucks doesn't it

237
00:12:18,320 --> 00:12:21,520
I'm sorry

238
00:12:19,760 --> 00:12:21,520
This is good idiot!

239
00:12:21,520 --> 00:12:25,720
My "Darling" song was definitely better

240
00:12:22,320 --> 00:12:25,720
This is good singing! Listen again

241
00:12:43,720 --> 00:12:45,760
Isn't the tempo too slow?

242
00:12:46,120 --> 00:12:48,720
It should be, a bit faster

243
00:12:48,800 --> 00:12:50,800
Like;

244
00:12:49,680 --> 00:12:52,360
Yeah, like that

245
00:12:51,000 --> 00:12:54,220
Every song is depressing

246
00:12:52,640 --> 00:12:54,560
Cause he's too slow?

247
00:12:53,480 --> 00:12:55,760
Cause he's too slow

248
00:12:54,800 --> 00:12:56,800
Ahh I see

249
00:12:56,240 --> 00:12:58,600
You just can't get into it

250
00:12:57,600 --> 00:13:00,200
Alright, then Tanaka,

251
00:13:00,200 --> 00:13:05,480
Right now, could you sing A capella?

252
00:13:03,000 --> 00:13:06,440
No preperation? Alright

253
00:13:10,800 --> 00:13:12,320
Off key at the end

254
00:13:12,320 --> 00:13:13,800
It's off key right?

255
00:13:13,800 --> 00:13:16,080
You always go off key at the end

256
00:13:15,080 --> 00:13:17,520
The "Nee" becomes "nEE"

257
00:13:16,400 --> 00:13:20,680
It actually goes;

258
00:13:20,680 --> 00:13:22,480
That's also a bit wrong

259
00:13:26,240 --> 00:13:30,120
What a betrayal

260
00:13:26,480 --> 00:13:30,120
What a betrayal

261
00:13:32,200 --> 00:13:33,920
I said so right?

262
00:13:37,840 --> 00:13:38,640
Right?

263
00:13:38,640 --> 00:13:41,760
He even said "Right?"

264
00:13:50,880 --> 00:13:52,020
Innit?

265
00:13:50,880 --> 00:13:52,760
He even said "innit"

266
00:13:52,960 --> 00:13:54,800
He asked me "innit"

267
00:13:55,040 --> 00:13:59,800
Alright then, I guess, next time we do this,

268
00:13:59,800 --> 00:14:04,320
We should pick one song that everyone has to sing

269
00:14:04,320 --> 00:14:08,280
I'd never lose a contest I created myself

270
00:14:09,720 --> 00:14:13,360
I want to enter that contest too

271
00:14:12,320 --> 00:14:15,040
No way... How can you say that?

272
00:14:13,520 --> 00:14:15,160
Why would you say that?

273
00:14:15,160 --> 00:14:18,360
No no, if it's a contest we create...

274
00:14:17,040 --> 00:14:19,040
There's no way I'd lose

275
00:14:19,520 --> 00:14:22,720
If Julie was there I'd be a little nervous

276
00:14:19,520 --> 00:14:22,720
TN: Julie = Sawada Kenji

277
00:14:23,320 --> 00:14:26,360
The real person?

278
00:14:25,160 --> 00:14:27,280
Only the real singer would make you nervous?

279
00:14:27,280 --> 00:14:29,760
I would get nervous, yeah

280
00:14:29,760 --> 00:14:32,440
I would sweat, a little

281
00:14:31,240 --> 00:14:33,260
Just a little?

282
00:14:35,160 --> 00:14:37,240
Do you have a cheerful one Tanaka?

283
00:14:37,240 --> 00:14:38,680
This one, the last one

284
00:14:38,680 --> 00:14:40,480
A cheerful song, for real

285
00:14:39,480 --> 00:14:41,480
Last one?

286
00:14:45,080 --> 00:14:46,920
You really love this guy huh?

287
00:14:47,080 --> 00:14:51,600
Casablanca Dandy - Sawada Kenji

288
00:14:48,200 --> 00:14:53,080
He's already lost it from the start - He's going "keEkEE"

289
00:14:49,400 --> 00:14:51,040
Really?

290
00:14:53,240 --> 00:14:54,760
But what about my voice?

291
00:14:54,840 --> 00:14:56,560
You sure love Julie

292
00:14:55,720 --> 00:14:57,800
Yes, I like him

293
00:14:58,520 --> 00:15:00,280
So cool!

294
00:14:59,000 --> 00:15:01,280
He's so cool, he really is

295
00:15:00,480 --> 00:15:01,760
Very cool

296
00:15:01,920 --> 00:15:04,120
Goddamn what a mess!

297
00:15:02,720 --> 00:15:05,240
You really messed that part up

298
00:15:05,640 --> 00:15:07,280
It's such a mess!

299
00:15:07,280 --> 00:15:08,840
Seriously?

300
00:15:08,840 --> 00:15:10,800
You just yeeeeted off course

301
00:15:10,800 --> 00:15:14,040
You really stretched that part out

302
00:15:16,520 --> 00:15:17,800
No way

303
00:15:17,800 --> 00:15:23,960
I think this might be considered his best song

304
00:15:22,800 --> 00:15:24,240
Oh really?

305
00:15:24,240 --> 00:15:25,360
Yes

306
00:15:26,200 --> 00:15:29,080
He's streching it. He's losing it.

307
00:15:29,080 --> 00:15:32,200
You're just going "GARI GARI GARI" against the guardrail

308
00:15:32,440 --> 00:15:36,640
You've got your foot down on the accelerator....just grinding against the rail

309
00:15:36,640 --> 00:15:38,880
I got it wrong huh

310
00:15:40,560 --> 00:15:42,560
This is a great song

311
00:15:41,960 --> 00:15:42,880
It is right?

312
00:15:42,880 --> 00:15:46,120
I listen to it sometimes on YouTube

313
00:15:46,120 --> 00:15:50,120
He spits out his whiskey and stuff

314
00:15:50,120 --> 00:15:51,760
Yeah he does

315
00:15:51,800 --> 00:15:54,200
This is a cool part

316
00:16:05,080 --> 00:16:08,120
Wow

317
00:16:06,800 --> 00:16:08,560
That was like,

318
00:16:08,560 --> 00:16:12,240
A depressing guy forcing himself...

319
00:16:12,240 --> 00:16:13,320
That's embarassing

320
00:16:13,320 --> 00:16:16,440
The song itself changed

321
00:16:14,880 --> 00:16:16,320
That's true

322
00:16:16,560 --> 00:16:18,560
Dahama

323
00:16:17,240 --> 00:16:19,120
Hamada-san please

324
00:16:19,120 --> 00:16:22,160
I only have dark songs!

325
00:16:22,160 --> 00:16:26,000
I have nothing up-tempo

326
00:16:24,680 --> 00:16:26,880
That's true

327
00:16:27,760 --> 00:16:30,960
For real let's redo this

328
00:16:29,760 --> 00:16:33,160
Yeah, more cheerful songs

329
00:16:36,400 --> 00:16:38,720
Why is there an echo?

330
00:16:39,320 --> 00:16:42,160
He's definitely in the bathroom

331
00:16:42,640 --> 00:16:44,320
He's singing in bathroom

332
00:16:44,320 --> 00:16:46,720
Yuki Saori?

333
00:16:46,750 --> 00:16:48,880
Oh I don't know this one. Do you?

334
00:16:48,880 --> 00:16:50,560
I got it

335
00:16:49,440 --> 00:16:51,720
Isn't this a great song too?

336
00:16:57,720 --> 00:17:00,840
What is this? You're just getting in the tub

337
00:17:02,120 --> 00:17:04,880
For real! Just singing as he gets in

338
00:17:04,080 --> 00:17:05,720
You're just taking a bath

339
00:17:07,440 --> 00:17:09,880
You're halfway inside

340
00:17:10,920 --> 00:17:12,900
He's in high spirits

341
00:17:13,840 --> 00:17:15,440
It's just dark

342
00:17:15,440 --> 00:17:18,720
You know this, it's a breakup song

343
00:17:18,720 --> 00:17:22,400
Remember a while back when Higashino got divorced?

344
00:17:22,920 --> 00:17:25,720
We did karaoke and I sang this for him

345
00:17:25,920 --> 00:17:27,320
Don't sing this!

346
00:17:28,720 --> 00:17:30,960
Well he did remarry

347
00:17:30,080 --> 00:17:33,440
Yes yes yes exactly. It turned out good in the end

348
00:17:35,280 --> 00:17:37,280
"Tegami" right?

349
00:17:36,160 --> 00:17:40,160
Yes "Tegami". It reminds me of Higashino

350
00:17:40,160 --> 00:17:41,240
I see

351
00:17:41,360 --> 00:17:46,040
Next time I guess I gotta do it like Yama-chan. Unless you go all out it's not fun.

352
00:17:46,040 --> 00:17:47,920
That's true

353
00:17:47,920 --> 00:17:50,400
Yama-chan how about you play one? You have so many

354
00:17:49,880 --> 00:17:51,840
Me?

355
00:17:50,800 --> 00:17:53,880
Yama-chan go on

356
00:17:52,160 --> 00:17:54,160
Please let us listen

357
00:17:54,160 --> 00:17:55,960
I think this one

358
00:17:56,960 --> 00:17:58,680
He goes all out

359
00:17:58,680 --> 00:18:01,240
There's a lot from the same artist

360
00:18:01,240 --> 00:18:03,360
You just like them right Yamasaki?

361
00:18:03,360 --> 00:18:05,760
You must have a lot of episodes

362
00:18:05,760 --> 00:18:09,760
He has no episodes at all

363
00:18:07,320 --> 00:18:09,360
I have no episodes at all

364
00:18:08,640 --> 00:18:10,160
None at all...

365
00:18:16,760 --> 00:18:19,280
Wow, is this Akina?

366
00:18:19,280 --> 00:18:22,120
This singing style is amazing

367
00:18:22,440 --> 00:18:25,200
This Akina singing style is amazing

368
00:18:26,520 --> 00:18:28,200
You're so into it!

369
00:18:33,000 --> 00:18:36,240
I would never think of taking on this challenge

370
00:18:35,680 --> 00:18:37,480
Amazing

371
00:18:36,600 --> 00:18:39,800
It's so difficult

372
00:18:41,400 --> 00:18:43,800
It's difficult this song

373
00:18:45,280 --> 00:18:47,440
He's so into it

374
00:18:57,760 --> 00:19:00,200
Amazing (x3)

375
00:19:00,200 --> 00:19:01,960
Amazing right?

376
00:19:00,760 --> 00:19:03,040
It is, it really is

377
00:19:09,040 --> 00:19:11,470
You know,

378
00:19:11,470 --> 00:19:14,560
It makes me wish they increase Yamasaki's salary

379
00:19:14,680 --> 00:19:18,200
I want to increase it for him, on Gaki

380
00:19:18,200 --> 00:19:19,840
Amazing!

381
00:19:19,840 --> 00:19:22,480
It would be nice if they increased his salary a bit more

382
00:19:22,480 --> 00:19:24,120
Yeah

383
00:19:25,160 --> 00:19:28,760
I think a 20% increase would be good

384
00:19:26,560 --> 00:19:28,800
20%?

385
00:19:30,520 --> 00:19:32,520
There's a lot of female singers though

386
00:19:32,520 --> 00:19:34,880
Well for now, let's try this one

387
00:19:37,360 --> 00:19:39,080
I have ones like this one too

388
00:19:39,080 --> 00:19:41,360
A lot of genres right?

389
00:19:40,240 --> 00:19:42,640
Yeah a lot

390
00:19:55,520 --> 00:19:59,100
This is Sano Motoharu right?

391
00:19:58,290 --> 00:20:02,280
Rock&Roll Night - Sano Motoharu

392
00:19:59,320 --> 00:20:00,880
This is awful

393
00:20:00,360 --> 00:20:01,880
You're kind of imitating him

394
00:20:01,280 --> 00:20:02,800
He is.

395
00:20:01,920 --> 00:20:03,840
But I guess that's unavoidable right?

396
00:20:03,080 --> 00:20:05,000
He's surpassed the original

397
00:20:06,560 --> 00:20:09,080
Awful (x3)

398
00:20:07,680 --> 00:20:10,640
Just sing in your own voice

399
00:20:10,880 --> 00:20:13,760
It's so exaggerated you can't tell who it is

400
00:20:14,080 --> 00:20:15,680
Not good (x3)

401
00:20:16,200 --> 00:20:19,090
Just listen to that a little longer please

402
00:20:18,080 --> 00:20:19,600
Why?

403
00:20:20,000 --> 00:20:22,360
Please, it's very-

404
00:20:22,760 --> 00:20:25,000
The second half?

405
00:20:23,520 --> 00:20:24,880
Yes

406
00:20:26,240 --> 00:20:28,200
This is a good song

407
00:20:39,200 --> 00:20:41,500
He's so on board

408
00:21:12,360 --> 00:21:13,840
It's a great song right?

409
00:21:13,840 --> 00:21:16,800
This was difficult..this was difficult

410
00:21:17,040 --> 00:21:18,960
And it's a great song

411
00:21:18,960 --> 00:21:22,520
And the singer is good too...I can understand that

412
00:21:22,520 --> 00:21:26,580
There's a lot to bring together

413
00:21:23,400 --> 00:21:26,920
Yes yes, exactly

414
00:21:27,160 --> 00:21:29,120
I see, it's a lot to bring together

415
00:21:28,160 --> 00:21:30,760
It's a lot to bring together

416
00:21:30,040 --> 00:21:31,760
Understood

417
00:21:30,760 --> 00:21:33,680
You even have to match the song and the brassiere

418
00:21:36,240 --> 00:21:44,640
This time Hosei is on fire ... What nostalgic song will he play next?

419
00:21:49,440 --> 00:21:51,800
For real,

420
00:22:00,520 --> 00:22:02,440
He shut it off!

421
00:22:03,120 --> 00:22:04,920
He won't even listen to it

422
00:22:04,920 --> 00:22:07,280
What the hell is this so annoying

423
00:22:09,200 --> 00:22:13,720
Matsumoto, please play it again, let's listen to it

424
00:22:13,720 --> 00:22:16,560
The first part was so annoying

425
00:22:32,680 --> 00:22:34,200
Enough

426
00:22:33,200 --> 00:22:35,000
Can I take this home with me?

427
00:22:36,520 --> 00:22:39,240
I think I'll laugh the entire time

428
00:22:37,920 --> 00:22:40,960
You can dub it

429
00:22:38,840 --> 00:22:41,960
I'll dub it

430
00:22:42,320 --> 00:22:45,320
I'll dub this, I'l-----

431
00:22:47,600 --> 00:22:52,240
Finally the drive is coming to an end

432
00:22:53,040 --> 00:22:56,440
Tanaka you gotta do better next time

433
00:22:54,840 --> 00:22:58,640
That's true

434
00:22:59,400 --> 00:23:02,400
That's a true insult

435
00:23:00,000 --> 00:23:02,240
You're right

436
00:23:02,680 --> 00:23:04,880
You were so monotone

437
00:23:03,240 --> 00:23:06,520
Yeah I was

438
00:23:06,520 --> 00:23:09,000
So this'll be the last one of the day

439
00:23:09,000 --> 00:23:11,920
Let's end with this

440
00:23:10,120 --> 00:23:11,760
Yes please

441
00:23:30,320 --> 00:23:32,080
Just amazing huh?

442
00:23:33,960 --> 00:23:35,920
Amazing...

443
00:23:36,200 --> 00:23:39,120
He got to sing all alone at home

444
00:23:39,360 --> 00:23:41,360
So impressive

445
00:23:43,840 --> 00:23:45,640
Amazing...

446
00:23:44,200 --> 00:23:48,400
It's either this one... Or Sebangou 3
