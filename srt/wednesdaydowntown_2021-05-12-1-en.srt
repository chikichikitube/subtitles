00:00:02,490 --> 00:00:05,860
Welcome to Wednesday Downtown,

2
00:00:06,650 --> 00:00:09,760
Let’s get on with our first presenter please

3
00:00:14,740 --> 00:00:18,400
Viking's Kotouge!

4
00:00:22,040 --> 00:00:24,770
Eh... it's that XXXX

5
00:00:27,330 --> 00:00:30,760
Can you say such a thing on TV?

6
00:00:31,680 --> 00:00:37,650
Today is the 5th edition of a highly popular project

7
00:00:38,290 --> 00:00:41,190
5th Sushi Master

8
00:00:41,190 --> 00:00:43,250
It's been a long time since we've done this

9
00:00:43,250 --> 00:00:45,750
Indeed, it's been a long time

10
00:00:45,750 --> 00:00:49,800
Yes, it's making a comeback after four years since 2017

11
00:00:49,920 --> 00:00:52,330
It can't be that popular if it's been four years

12
00:00:52,330 --> 00:00:53,800
It's not really popular

13
00:00:53,800 --> 00:00:57,030
If it's a prank thing, to avoid suspicion

14
00:00:57,030 --> 00:00:58,670
It's understandable that it would need to be put on hold for a while

15
00:00:58,670 --> 00:01:00,440
But that's not the case for this one

16
00:01:00,530 --> 00:01:03,480
Did you get a bribe from the sushi underworld?

17
00:01:03,480 --> 00:01:06,310
No, I didn't

18
00:01:06,310 --> 00:01:08,650
There is no hidden agenda between this show and underworld sushi

19
00:01:08,650 --> 00:01:14,380
After four years, new songs of the sushi master will be challenged

20
00:01:15,570 --> 00:01:16,520
And

21
00:01:16,750 --> 00:01:19,950
I slept over at a comedian's place

22
00:01:19,950 --> 00:01:26,900
When hearing amazing gossip, you'll drop what you're doing and focus on listening

23
00:01:43,120 --> 00:01:49,990
The same as Taiko no Tatsujin, participants eat the ingredients that are sent to them in rhythm with the song

24
00:01:49,990 --> 00:01:51,740
This game is Sushi Man

25
00:01:52,530 --> 00:01:56,400
Three members will challenge a level at once

26
00:01:57,850 --> 00:01:59,800
But even with some heavy hitters

27
00:01:59,800 --> 00:02:04,110
LEVEL 4 has yet to be completed

28
00:02:04,110 --> 00:02:07,170
A challenge that has still never been overcome

29
00:02:08,120 --> 00:02:11,740
Who will be the first in four years to take on this challenge?

30
00:02:11,480 --> 00:02:12,930
Who?

31
00:02:16,500 --> 00:02:18,400
Can they do it?

32
00:02:16,890 --> 00:02:20,690
Three comedians who consider themselves big eaters

33
00:02:20,310 --> 00:02:22,250
Can they eat that well?

34
00:02:20,810 --> 00:02:23,010
Are they confident?

35
00:02:23,010 --> 00:02:25,020
I always eat very quickly

36
00:02:25,020 --> 00:02:27,320
I have confidence in my appetite

37
00:02:27,320 --> 00:02:32,000
As for speed, as a fireman, you sometimes need to eat quick and rush out

38
00:02:32,290 --> 00:02:35,680
Usually, I can do 50 or 60 plates of revolving sushi

39
00:02:35,790 --> 00:02:45,530
Fish Kingdom

40
00:02:35,860 --> 00:02:53,940
Please eat sushi!

41
00:02:35,930 --> 00:02:53,940
Food Group - Ⅱ

42
00:02:35,990 --> 00:02:53,940
Magic Pocket

43
00:02:36,060 --> 00:02:53,940
Gari Gari-kun
Cod roe

44
00:02:36,460 --> 00:02:38,110
Wow

45
00:02:37,130 --> 00:02:41,530
The five levels are as follows

46
00:02:42,420 --> 00:02:48,980
In three-player mode, Fish Kingdom, is skipped as this level has already been cleared

47
00:02:48,980 --> 00:02:53,110
The challenge starts from LEVEL 2's "Please eat sushi!" Start the challenge

48
00:02:53,110 --> 00:02:55,310
This is a fast-paced song
-Very fast

49
00:02:55,310 --> 00:02:56,120
The sushi's here!

50
00:02:56,120 --> 00:02:58,300
So quick!

51
00:02:58,300 --> 00:03:04,590
As team work is very important, will they be able to work together?

52
00:03:04,590 --> 00:03:07,470
Really tough

53
00:03:06,010 --> 00:03:10,630
Tuna medium brisket, small fins, and bamboo fish, welcome

54
00:03:10,530 --> 00:03:13,980
Star eel, sweet shrimp, pickled mackerel, sea bass, welcome

55
00:03:12,270 --> 00:03:13,890
So fast!

56
00:03:13,780 --> 00:03:17,370
Scallops, abalone, red scallops, sea scallops, welcome

57
00:03:15,850 --> 00:03:17,370
Impossible!

58
00:03:17,270 --> 00:03:21,430
Bonito, red trevally, sea urchin, salmon roe, welcome

59
00:03:18,000 --> 00:03:20,810
Quickly quickly!

60
00:03:21,480 --> 00:03:23,760
Not good, but close

61
00:03:22,240 --> 00:03:25,720
Our sushi place is number 1 in japan!

62
00:03:25,720 --> 00:03:34,060
Please eat sushi! Please eat sushi! Please eat sushi!

63
00:03:33,620 --> 00:03:35,170
Take it, take it!

64
00:03:34,510 --> 00:03:37,060
Drinking tea, drinking tea, have a sip of tea

65
00:03:36,050 --> 00:03:37,390
What's wrong with you?

66
00:03:36,160 --> 00:03:39,030
Sweet ginger, sweet ginger with some sweet ginger

67
00:03:37,960 --> 00:03:39,840
Come on, sweet ginger is coming, sweet ginger is coming!

68
00:03:40,360 --> 00:03:42,330
Eat quicker!

69
00:03:40,360 --> 00:03:43,880
The head of the octopus round and round

70
00:03:43,240 --> 00:03:44,730
Pick it up!

71
00:03:43,880 --> 00:03:47,380
Squid with triangular ears

72
00:03:44,730 --> 00:03:48,980
Here comes the snapper

73
00:03:47,380 --> 00:03:50,240
Snapper in love with wakame

74
00:03:48,980 --> 00:03:51,400
The pig on the right isn't taking anything!

75
00:03:50,040 --> 00:03:54,630
Flounder holding a red thread on the porch

76
00:03:56,200 --> 00:03:58,090
Chewing so slowly

77
00:03:56,670 --> 00:03:59,080
Our sushi restaurant is the number one in Japan

78
00:03:59,010 --> 00:04:01,350
Actually not bad

79
00:03:59,080 --> 00:04:07,420
Please eat sushi! Please eat sushi! Please eat sushi!

80
00:04:01,350 --> 00:04:02,500
Not bad, not bad

81
00:04:02,500 --> 00:04:04,430
7 Guan left

82
00:04:06,540 --> 00:04:08,250
They could do it

83
00:04:08,070 --> 00:04:10,590
Have some tea. Have some tea. Have some tea

84
00:04:08,660 --> 00:04:10,580
Get the tea!

85
00:04:10,080 --> 00:04:13,620
Sweet ginger, sweet ginger with some sweet ginger

86
00:04:10,580 --> 00:04:13,070
Sweet ginger's coming!

87
00:04:16,160 --> 00:04:18,050
Impressive

88
00:04:17,200 --> 00:04:21,520
"Please eat sushi!" is over!

89
00:04:21,600 --> 00:04:23,740
Much faster than I expected

90
00:04:23,740 --> 00:04:27,910
It took some time to figure out how to open my throat

91
00:04:28,010 --> 00:04:29,900
To swallow the food so quickly

92
00:04:29,900 --> 00:04:34,040
It took a while to get used to it, yeah

93
00:04:34,150 --> 00:04:37,210
What nonsense are you talking about?

94
00:04:37,690 --> 00:04:41,350
On to LEVEL 3

95
00:04:38,820 --> 00:04:40,990
Not saying anything of worth

96
00:04:41,350 --> 00:04:48,430
Instead of challenging a previous stage, a new challenge is undertaken

97
00:04:48,430 --> 00:04:50,280
Let's cooperate and win together

98
00:04:49,630 --> 00:04:50,700
What is the new tune?

99
00:04:50,700 --> 00:04:51,970
A total of 16?

100
00:04:51,970 --> 00:04:54,150
What kind of food is it?

101
00:04:54,870 --> 00:04:56,780
What is the tune?

102
00:04:57,580 --> 00:04:59,190
Haven't heard it

103
00:05:00,110 --> 00:05:04,910
Captured by you on the day we first met

104
00:05:02,220 --> 00:05:04,520
Tatsuro Yamashita?
-Sounds like it

105
00:05:04,910 --> 00:05:08,160
But I couldn't say anything

106
00:05:05,130 --> 00:05:06,680
Don't underestimate it!

107
00:05:08,290 --> 00:05:10,270
It'll suddenly come

108
00:05:10,270 --> 00:05:11,550
Seems quite slow-paced

109
00:05:11,000 --> 00:05:15,670
Two people standing in front of a doughnut store

110
00:05:11,550 --> 00:05:14,170
Oh, what is this?
-Donuts

111
00:05:14,170 --> 00:05:17,030
Doughnuts are not easy to eat

112
00:05:16,160 --> 00:05:20,100
A youthful mood rushing up the ramp

113
00:05:20,680 --> 00:05:25,080
Ah, I'll only eat doughnuts with yo

114
00:05:24,110 --> 00:05:27,540
Not bad!

115
00:05:25,080 --> 00:05:29,630
Ah, I want to eat doughnuts with you

116
00:05:29,300 --> 00:05:31,090
Too big!

117
00:05:29,630 --> 00:05:34,120
Ah, sweet kisses like doughnuts

118
00:05:31,720 --> 00:05:33,140
Pretty good

119
00:05:34,120 --> 00:05:38,480
Ah, a future of doughnuts for two

120
00:05:35,510 --> 00:05:38,110
Can't they use slightly smaller ones

121
00:05:38,480 --> 00:05:40,810
I am the twisted twist donut

122
00:05:40,810 --> 00:05:43,070
You are the sweet icing doughnut

123
00:05:43,070 --> 00:05:47,540
And finally, a whipped cream donut

124
00:05:45,690 --> 00:05:46,860
Pigs!

125
00:05:47,540 --> 00:05:51,820
Ah, my heart goes out to you doughnut

126
00:05:51,810 --> 00:05:53,200
Not good not good

127
00:05:51,820 --> 00:05:56,370
Ah, I like you so much donut

128
00:05:53,200 --> 00:05:55,370
Still 7?

129
00:05:55,370 --> 00:05:57,370
This is too hard

130
00:05:56,370 --> 00:06:01,060
Ah, I'll only eat doughnuts with you

131
00:05:57,370 --> 00:06:01,430
Pigs! Pig! This pig doesn't eat at all

132
00:06:01,060 --> 00:06:05,000
Ah, I want to eat doughnuts with you

133
00:06:05,000 --> 00:06:09,650
Ah, sweet, sweet, sweet doughnuts

134
00:06:06,440 --> 00:06:09,340
It's too big!

135
00:06:09,650 --> 00:06:14,090
Ah, sweet, sweet, sweet doughnuts

136
00:06:10,410 --> 00:06:13,950
Not good
-Who's gonna eat the last 3?

137
00:06:14,090 --> 00:06:18,580
Ah, sweet, sweet, sweet doughnuts

138
00:06:16,140 --> 00:06:17,710
Pigs!!!

139
00:06:18,580 --> 00:06:23,180
Ah, sweet, sweet, sweet doughnuts

140
00:06:19,210 --> 00:06:20,880
That's the last one.
-It's doable

141
00:06:21,510 --> 00:06:23,960
Come on!
-Success!

142
00:06:23,960 --> 00:06:25,960
Not eaten all of it

143
00:06:27,330 --> 00:06:28,530
It's not in your mouth!

144
00:06:29,120 --> 00:06:30,960
What is the result?

145
00:06:30,960 --> 00:06:33,000
What the hell?

146
00:06:33,260 --> 00:06:35,360
Too much

147
00:06:35,360 --> 00:06:37,640
I'd like to have some creamy ones

148
00:06:37,640 --> 00:06:39,440
The ones that come up are just fried, aren't they?

149
00:06:39,440 --> 00:06:40,700
I can't swallow it!

150
00:06:40,700 --> 00:06:42,000
One or two is not bad

151
00:06:42,140 --> 00:06:44,070
The powder just sticks around in the back of your throat

152
00:06:44,240 --> 00:06:46,300
What the hell is this guy talking about?

153
00:06:46,690 --> 00:06:48,300
The other two aren't saying a word

154
00:06:48,300 --> 00:06:51,110
Why is it this guy explaining every time?

155
00:06:51,530 --> 00:06:56,180
Suffering donutization of the oral cavity with the mouth's moisture being sucked up

156
00:06:56,180 --> 00:06:59,430
The comedian team are defeated at this point

157
00:07:01,030 --> 00:07:03,060
The next challengers are

158
00:07:04,650 --> 00:07:06,700
Hello

159
00:07:06,700 --> 00:07:10,010
Two plus-size performers and one known for her big stomach

160
00:07:10,010 --> 00:07:14,920
Yoshimoto's female comedy team

161
00:07:11,160 --> 00:07:14,090
Tough to say if they can do it or not

162
00:07:16,670 --> 00:07:18,640
Whats the most amount of sushi you've ever eaten?

163
00:07:18,640 --> 00:07:20,500
100

164
00:07:20,700 --> 00:07:22,040
Impressive

165
00:07:20,710 --> 00:07:24,690
It's easy to see from our body size

166
00:07:24,690 --> 00:07:27,080
I eat about 6000 calories every day

167
00:07:27,080 --> 00:07:29,100
That's how much I eat

168
00:07:28,170 --> 00:07:29,100
Wow

169
00:07:29,100 --> 00:07:32,940
Here we go.
-It's started. We can do it!

170
00:07:33,350 --> 00:07:38,230
The female team begin the "Please eat sushi!" challenge

171
00:07:42,140 --> 00:07:45,220
Tuna medium brisket, small fins, and bamboo fish, welcome

172
00:07:45,220 --> 00:07:48,680
Star eel, sweet shrimp, pickled mackerel, sea bass, welcome

173
00:07:45,250 --> 00:07:46,190
Two at once!

174
00:07:46,190 --> 00:07:47,530
Not bad

175
00:07:47,900 --> 00:07:50,040
Super quick

176
00:07:48,680 --> 00:07:53,230
Scallops, abalone, scallops, sea scallops, welcome

177
00:07:50,380 --> 00:07:52,270
Don't lose your chain, you idiot

178
00:07:52,000 --> 00:07:56,000
Bonito, red trevally, sea urchin, salmon roe, welcome

179
00:07:54,540 --> 00:07:58,980
Get it!
-That was close. The rhythm didn't fit

180
00:07:57,140 --> 00:08:00,180
Our sushi restaurant is the number one in Japan

181
00:07:58,980 --> 00:08:00,780
Good, good, good, good.

182
00:07:59,820 --> 00:08:09,820
Please eat sushi! Please eat sushi! Please eat sushi!

183
00:08:01,520 --> 00:08:03,320
Dangerous. Dangerous. Come on!

184
00:08:04,150 --> 00:08:06,020
Just hurry up and get it!

185
00:08:04,720 --> 00:08:08,730
Two mini tanks with goalkeeper Utsunomiya

186
00:08:08,730 --> 00:08:13,060
The perfect match to take out 25 kanzushi

187
00:08:09,010 --> 00:08:12,010
Have some tea. Have some tea. Have some tea

188
00:08:11,160 --> 00:08:14,990
Sweet ginger, sweet ginger with sweet ginger

189
00:08:13,060 --> 00:08:16,430
What the hell? Hurry up and eat sweet ginger!

190
00:08:15,800 --> 00:08:18,210
The head of the octopus is round

191
00:08:16,430 --> 00:08:19,230
The purple pig isn't doing it in time

192
00:08:19,070 --> 00:08:23,050
Have some tea. Have some tea. Have some tea

193

OK

197
00:08:28,390 --> 00:08:32,370
"Please Eat Sushi!" is over!

198
00:08:32,450 --> 00:08:34,980
However

199
00:08:34,980 --> 00:08:36,640
Have you been picking what you like to eat?

200
00:08:36,520 --> 00:08:38,710
Yes, the distribution is not balanced

201
00:08:36,640 --> 00:08:38,650
No, it's all her fault

202
00:08:39,160 --> 00:08:40,580
She ate all the good food

203
00:08:40,660 --> 00:08:44,050
I only got ginger and wakame and stuff

204
00:08:44,160 --> 00:08:45,850
But we got through it

205
00:08:46,200 --> 00:08:48,790
I'm so happy.
-It was a breeze

206
00:08:49,310 --> 00:08:55,500
Which LEVEL 3 stage will be chosen for the female team?

207
00:08:55,500 --> 00:08:58,320
Food Group - II

208
00:08:57,110 --> 00:08:58,320
What is it?

209
00:08:59,800 --> 00:09:03,500
① Bento Box Song

210
00:09:03,130 --> 00:09:03,950
What is this tune?

211
00:09:04,110 --> 00:09:07,110
Festive tunes

212
00:09:07,110 --> 00:09:09,010
It is a festive tune

213
00:09:09,810 --> 00:09:13,600
A small bento box

214
00:09:10,820 --> 00:09:12,560
Oh this one

215
00:09:13,600 --> 00:09:16,930
Stuffed with two nori rice balls

216
00:09:15,000 --> 00:09:17,600
The rice balls are so big

217
00:09:17,600 --> 00:09:19,770
Chopped ginger and sprinkled with crushed sesame seeds

218
00:09:18,770 --> 00:09:19,780

Lotus root with holes

222
00:09:31,890 --> 00:09:33,760
Ok ok

223
00:09:32,780 --> 00:09:35,760
The tall bee-doo vegetable

224
00:09:33,760 --> 00:09:35,760
34 plates left

225
00:09:36,590 --> 00:09:38,340
It's even easier than before

226
00:09:37,000 --> 00:09:41,660
② Song of Mushrooms

227
00:09:40,800 --> 00:09:42,140
Mushrooms?

228
00:09:41,800 --> 00:09:43,590
Here comes the mushroom

229
00:09:41,800 --> 00:09:45,280
The little mushroom grows well

230
00:09:44,800 --> 00:09:48,360
Apricot abalone mushroom, danmao mushroom and crab flavored mushroom

231
00:09:46,650 --> 00:09:51,110
Get it! Get it!

232
00:09:48,360 --> 00:09:51,700
Tiny mushrooms growing strong without panic

233
00:09:51,700 --> 00:09:55,220
Tasty little mushrooms eaten in one bite

234
00:09:56,740 --> 00:10:00,980
Tiny mushrooms growing well without panic

235
00:09:57,510 --> 00:09:59,410
Can't swallow anymore

236
00:10:00,600 --> 00:10:02,120
Swallow it quickly!

237
00:10:00,980 --> 00:10:03,710
Chewy apricot mushrooms love to jump on the teeth

238
00:10:03,700 --> 00:10:06,290
She's just watching the food pass

239
00:10:03,710 --> 00:10:07,130
Tiny mushrooms growing strong without panic

240
00:10:06,290 --> 00:10:08,740
She's working hard!

241
00:10:07,130 --> 00:10:10,890
Hot little mushrooms eaten in one bite

242
00:10:09,520 --> 00:10:10,890
Still relatively easy

243
00:10:11,700 --> 00:10:17,000
③ 3 Dango Brothers

244
00:10:11,900 --> 00:10:13,910
There are still 19 plates

245
00:10:13,910 --> 00:10:16,340
Dango？
-3 Dango Brothers

246
00:10:16,870 --> 00:10:17,860
You'll choke

247
00:10:17,860 --> 00:10:19,860
Not good.
-This is harder

248
00:10:19,550 --> 00:10:23,000
A wooden skewer with a string of dangos

249
00:10:21,360 --> 00:10:22,760

Drizzle soy sauce over the top, dango dango

253
00:10:27,350 --> 00:10:29,430
One person can take two skewers

254
00:10:29,420 --> 00:10:31,890
3 Dango Brothers

255
00:10:32,750 --> 00:10:36,050
Enjoying flowers in spring, enjoying flowers

256
00:10:36,050 --> 00:10:39,430
Looking at the moon in autumn, looking at the moon

257
00:10:37,490 --> 00:10:39,960
They can rest in between

258
00:10:39,420 --> 00:10:42,620
All year round, dango dango

259
00:10:41,600 --> 00:10:44,050
Ok ok ok

260
00:10:42,620 --> 00:10:45,710
3 Dango brothers, brothers

261
00:10:44,050 --> 00:10:46,760
That's it, purple one!

262
00:10:45,710 --> 00:10:47,410
Dango dango

263
00:10:47,410 --> 00:10:49,280
Dango dango

264
00:10:49,260 --> 00:10:51,800
Good good, not bad

265
00:10:49,280 --> 00:10:50,930
3 Dango Brothers

266
00:10:50,930 --> 00:10:52,580
3 Dango Brothers

267
00:10:51,800 --> 00:10:53,360
Last 3

268
00:10:52,580 --> 00:10:54,580
3 Dango Brothers

269
00:10:54,580 --> 00:10:56,190
Dango

270
00:10:59,310 --> 00:11:03,240
And so, the female team complete the stage!

271
00:11:02,600 --> 00:11:03,780
This is a good team

272
00:11:03,780 --> 00:11:08,350
Passed LEVEL 3

273
00:11:08,640 --> 00:11:09,440
Awesome

274
00:11:12,270 --> 00:11:13,850
What is it?

275
00:11:13,840 --> 00:11:18,110
They now embark on a new challenge, LEVEL 4

276
00:11:13,850 --> 00:11:15,850
Why was that included?

277
00:11:19,010 --> 00:11:22,990
A new song is chosen

278
00:11:21,600 --> 00:11:22,990
What is it?

279
00:11:22,990 --> 00:11:27,990
What will happen?

280
00:11:26,020 --> 00:11:27,990
46?

281
00:11:26,020 --> 00:11:30,690
④ Yodel has had enough

282
00:11:31,340 --> 00:11:35,300
All-you-can-eat barbecue buffet

283
00:11:35,300 --> 00:11:38,740
Eat until you're full oh yo lo lo lo hey

284
00:11:36,770 --> 00:11:38,000
So much

285
00:11:39,020 --> 00:11:43,180
German sausage to your heart's content

286
00:11:40,480 --> 00:11:41,950
So big!

287
00:11:43,180 --> 00:11:47,180
Eat until you're full oh yo lo lo lo hey

288
00:11:47,000 --> 00:11:49,420
Cow stomach, cow tongue, cow stomach, cow tongue

289
00:11:48,620 --> 00:11:52,430
Full on beef stomach, beef tongue and beef sirloin

290
00:11:49,760 --> 00:11:52,710
Get it!

291
00:11:51,330 --> 00:11:53,330
Pork liver, pork liver

292
00:11:52,830 --> 00:11:56,330
Roast pork liver and veal chops

293
00:11:54,000 --> 00:11:56,360
Oi, purple one!!

294
00:11:55,200 --> 00:11:59,000
Dipping sauce dipping sauce dipping sauce

295
00:11:57,000 --> 00:11:59,900
Dip, dip, dip, dip, dip, dip, dip, dip, dip, dip, dip, dip, dip!

296
00:11:57,600 --> 00:11:59,830
Dip, dip, dip!

297
00:12:03,690 --> 00:12:05,550
So much dip, what the hell?

298
00:12:05,550 --> 00:12:08,070
This one is too hard

299
00:12:09,190 --> 00:12:11,490
This is really hard, too much

300
00:12:11,700 --> 00:12:15,100
No... I can't stand drinking dip

301
00:12:15,680 --> 00:12:19,300
Because they could not withstand the surging dip eight consecutive attack

302
00:12:19,300 --> 00:12:22,090
The female team lost at LEVEL4

303
00:12:20,180 --> 00:12:23,300
As Hamada said though, that girl really isn't good

304
00:12:22,810 --> 00:12:25,220
So the next challenger is

305
00:12:25,760 --> 00:12:31,760
Hello

306
00:12:28,640 --> 00:12:30,160
Who?

307
00:12:30,640 --> 00:12:32,000
A big eater?

308
00:12:32,320 --> 00:12:36,280
Two people who both eat 20 pounds of food on Youtube

309
00:12:36,280 --> 00:12:38,570
The Hungry Tummy Twins and

310
00:12:39,390 --> 00:12:42,770
The big eater presenter Asako Tani

311
00:12:43,470 --> 00:12:46,810
A new generation team of gluttons

312
00:13:00,850 --> 00:13:05,390
The big eater team skips the previous levels

313
00:13:05,390 --> 00:13:08,260
And start at LEVEL 3

314
00:13:10,430 --> 00:13:14,070
It's the bento box song

315
00:13:10,430 --> 00:13:14,070
① Bento Box Song

316
00:13:14,230 --> 00:13:17,360
Food Group - II is chosen

317
00:13:17,360 --> 00:13:19,360
Ah, nervous

318
00:13:19,640 --> 00:13:21,360
They should be very capable, right?

319
00:13:21,090 --> 00:13:24,820
A small bento box

320
00:13:24,820 --> 00:13:28,330
Stuff two nori rice balls into it

321
00:13:28,330 --> 00:13:32,210
Chopped ginger and sprinkled with crushed sesame seeds

322
00:13:32,210 --> 00:13:40,130
Carrots, cherries, mushrooms, burdock

323
00:13:41,640 --> 00:13:43,940
Lotus root with holes

324
00:13:42,460 --> 00:13:44,090
Good rhythm

325
00:13:44,040 --> 00:13:47,480
The tall bee-doo vegetable

326
00:13:44,090 --> 00:13:46,090
They're awesome!

327
00:13:48,740 --> 00:13:51,000
As expected of professional big eaters

328
00:13:51,000 --> 00:13:53,530
LEVEL3 is easily completed

329
00:13:52,870 --> 00:13:54,040
Passed it

330
00:13:54,040 --> 00:13:55,300
As expected

331
00:13:55,300 --> 00:14:02,490
Thus, they pass to LEVEL4

332
00:14:03,250 --> 00:14:06,550
Will they pass it?

333
00:14:07,340 --> 00:14:09,490
What is this song?

334
00:14:10,100 --> 00:14:14,400
All-you-can-eat barbecue buffet

335
00:14:10,890 --> 00:14:13,490
Ah, meat!

336
00:14:14,800 --> 00:14:18,250
Eat until you're full!

337
00:14:15,890 --> 00:14:17,270
Looks easy for them

338
00:14:17,270 --> 00:14:19,170
Don't eat so slowly

339
00:14:18,000 --> 00:14:22,500
The dip is waiting in the back

340
00:14:22,900 --> 00:14:26,410
Eat until you're full oh yo lo lo lo hey

341
00:14:24,440 --> 00:14:26,440
They gonna win?

342
00:14:26,060 --> 00:14:28,100
Cow stomach, cow tongue, cow stomach, cow tongue

343
00:14:27,900 --> 00:14:30,860
Full on beef stomach, beef tongue and beef sirloin

344
00:14:30,180 --> 00:14:33,330
If you don't take it quickly, there'll be something left

345
00:14:30,460 --> 00:14:33,830
Pork liver, pork liver

346
00:14:31,830 --> 00:14:34,670
Roast pork liver and veal chops

347
00:14:33,330 --> 00:14:35,380
Get it! Get it!

348
00:14:34,270 --> 00:14:37,860
Dipping dipping dipping

349
00:14:35,860 --> 00:14:39,870
Dip dip dip dip dip dip

350
00:14:36,350 --> 00:14:38,880
Here comes the dip. Here comes the dip

351
00:14:40,020 --> 00:14:41,580
Ah, missed one!

352
00:14:41,690 --> 00:14:43,640
OUT

353
00:14:42,470 --> 00:14:44,390
Too difficult

354
00:14:44,390 --> 00:14:50,270
This team also loses at this stage

355
00:14:47,900 --> 00:14:53,100
They worked hard

356
00:14:50,700 --> 00:14:53,250
The final challenger is...

357
00:14:56,970 --> 00:14:58,610
I've come to eat

358
00:14:57,430 --> 00:14:59,230
The strongest team

359
00:14:59,910 --> 00:15:01,730
Legends

360
00:15:01,310 --> 00:15:05,210
The Legendary Big Eater Trio

361
00:15:05,380 --> 00:15:06,970
To some extent, this is a game

362
00:15:06,970 --> 00:15:10,240
I think it requires swallowing ability more than anything

363
00:15:11,000 --> 00:15:18,560
For LEVEL3, they tackle the donut song that the other group were helpless against

364
00:15:19,260 --> 00:15:21,130
Can they handle it?

365
00:15:27,290 --> 00:15:28,960
Why is he sitting?

366
00:15:30,080 --> 00:15:31,500
He's too tall

367
00:15:30,100 --> 00:15:33,540
Captured by you on the day we first met

368
00:15:31,500 --> 00:15:33,150
Can't fit into the shot
-Oh yeah

369
00:15:32,400 --> 00:15:34,720
Isn't this Taro Yamashita?

370
00:15:34,710 --> 00:15:38,000
But I couldn't say anything

371
00:15:34,720 --> 00:15:36,720
You understand

372
00:15:38,860 --> 00:15:39,920
Oh, here we go

373
00:15:39,920 --> 00:15:41,400
There it is

374
00:15:40,340 --> 00:15:45,550
Two people standing in front of a doughnut store

375
00:15:45,000 --> 00:15:47,250
They look so happy

376
00:15:45,680 --> 00:15:50,900
A youthful mood rushing up the ramp

377
00:15:47,600 --> 00:15:50,490
Here we go. I'll take care of the next one

378
00:15:52,470 --> 00:15:55,000
Ah, I'll only eat doughnuts with you

379
00:15:55,000 --> 00:15:58,900
Ah, I want to eat doughnuts with you

380
00:15:59,460 --> 00:16:03,420
Ah, sweet kisses like doughnuts

381
00:16:00,170 --> 00:16:01,700
What's he doing?

382
00:16:01,700 --> 00:16:03,260
He's having a sit down

383
00:16:03,260 --> 00:16:04,900
Finally got one

384
00:16:03,970 --> 00:16:08,300
Ah, a future of doughnuts for two

385
00:16:07,720 --> 00:16:09,150
Every mouthful is so big

386
00:16:08,100 --> 00:16:11,430
I am the twisted twist donut

387
00:16:10,650 --> 00:16:13,780
You are the sweet icing doughnut

388
00:16:12,780 --> 00:16:17,040
And finally, a whipped cream donut

389
00:16:15,130 --> 00:16:17,360
Cream doughnuts

390
00:16:17,360 --> 00:16:21,820
Ah, my heart goes out to you doughnut

391
00:16:18,830 --> 00:16:21,440
Here we go
-Impressive

392
00:16:21,820 --> 00:16:26,260
Ah, I like you so much donut

393
00:16:24,690 --> 00:16:26,260
Ah, got it
-Really powerful

394
00:16:26,260 --> 00:16:28,170
The first two are pretty much enough

395
00:16:26,260 --> 00:16:30,590
Ah, I'll only eat doughnuts with you

396
00:16:30,370 --> 00:16:33,100
They can do it easily
-Last five

397
00:16:30,590 --> 00:16:35,080
Ah, I want to eat doughnuts with you

398
00:16:35,080 --> 00:16:37,300
They're enjoying themselves

399
00:16:35,080 --> 00:16:39,540
Ah, sweet, sweet, sweet doughnut

400
00:16:39,540 --> 00:16:43,930
Ah, sweet, sweet, sweet doughnut

401
00:16:43,930 --> 00:16:48,290
Ah, sweet, sweet, sweet doughnut

402
00:16:45,520 --> 00:16:47,730
Last two

403
00:16:48,290 --> 00:16:53,290
Ah, sweet, sweet, sweet doughnuts

404
00:16:48,640 --> 00:16:50,320
Easy

405
00:16:51,920 --> 00:16:54,620
As expected

406
00:16:54,620 --> 00:16:56,620
They're certainly big eaters

407
00:17:00,000 --> 00:17:04,690
DONUT SONG complete!

408
00:17:04,660 --> 00:17:06,320
Easy
-Easy

409
00:17:06,320 --> 00:17:09,040
Honestly not difficult

410
00:17:09,040 --> 00:17:10,790
Why so quiet?

411
00:17:12,040 --> 00:17:13,440
How loud do you want it?

412
00:17:13,440 --> 00:17:18,450
Next, they challenge LEVEL4

413
00:17:18,450 --> 00:17:22,500
The so far unbeatable "Yodel has had enough"

414
00:17:23,650 --> 00:17:26,190
Can they pass?

415
00:17:26,190 --> 00:17:28,090
Who knows

416
00:17:28,090 --> 00:17:31,120
I know this, i've sung it at karaoke

417
00:17:31,120 --> 00:17:35,170
All-you-can-eat barbecue

418
00:17:35,170 --> 00:17:38,170
Eat until you're full oh yo lo lo lo hey

419
00:17:35,940 --> 00:17:38,170
Move your hands, so annoying

420
00:17:38,170 --> 00:17:39,870
Grab it already!

421
00:17:39,100 --> 00:17:42,940
German sausage to your heart's content

422
00:17:39,870 --> 00:17:41,480
Awesome

423
00:17:42,940 --> 00:17:46,390
Eat until you're full oh yo lo lo lo hey

424
00:17:47,070 --> 00:17:49,400
Cow stomach, cow tongue, cow stomach, cow tongue

425
00:17:48,400 --> 00:17:50,940
Full on beef stomach, beef tongue and beef sirloin

426
00:17:50,500 --> 00:17:52,170
It's so awesome
-How awesome

427
00:17:50,740 --> 00:17:53,370
Pork liver, pork liver

428
00:17:52,170 --> 00:17:54,910
No meat can reaches him

429
00:17:52,270 --> 00:17:54,910
Roast pork liver and veal chops

430
00:17:55,290 --> 00:17:57,060
Dipping dipping dipping

431
00:17:56,660 --> 00:18:00,680
Dip, dip, dip, dip, dip, dip, dip, dip, dip, dip, dip, dip, dip!

432
00:17:57,360 --> 00:18:01,220
Come on, get a little more

433
00:18:01,880 --> 00:18:03,600
Awesome!

434
00:18:03,600 --> 00:18:06,590
Impressive

435
00:18:06,590 --> 00:18:09,920
So difficult, dipping sauce

436
00:18:10,280 --> 00:18:15,060
Full on pork, chicken and squid

437
00:18:15,060 --> 00:18:18,750
Eat until you're full oh yo lo lo lo hey

438
00:18:18,750 --> 00:18:23,070
Roast corn, cabbage and onion

439
00:18:23,070 --> 00:18:26,560
Roast whatever you want hey

440
00:18:26,560 --> 00:18:30,890
Rice, rice, pickled radish, pickled cabbage

441
00:18:30,890 --> 00:18:34,310
Dessert, fruit, almond, tofu, whatever

442
00:18:34,310 --> 00:18:35,540
Good, good!

443
00:18:34,650 --> 00:18:38,670
Dipping dipping dipping

444
00:18:38,670 --> 00:18:42,040
Beer is extra

445
00:18:41,200 --> 00:18:42,100
So strong

446
00:18:46,780 --> 00:18:47,870
Invincible!

447
00:18:49,000 --> 00:18:49,870
They did it!

448
00:18:51,940 --> 00:18:56,780
The first clearence of Sushi Master LEVEL4!

449
00:18:56,770 --> 00:19:00,070
To be honest, I basically didn't eat anything

450
00:19:00,060 --> 00:19:01,070
Really?

451
00:19:00,930 --> 00:19:04,070
Indeed
-Only pig liver and fruit

452
00:19:01,070 --> 00:19:03,160
Basically, you two did it

453
00:19:03,910 --> 00:19:08,860
Next is the most difficult, LEVEL5!

454
00:19:08,860 --> 00:19:13,830
With three songs to choose from

455
00:19:16,120 --> 00:19:20,420
A carrot

456
00:19:20,420 --> 00:19:25,450
Carrot

457
00:19:25,450 --> 00:19:28,250
Two cool mops

458
00:19:28,250 --> 00:19:32,030
Three yachts

459
00:19:31,620 --> 00:19:33,500
It's hard to eat carrot

460
00:19:32,030 --> 00:19:35,530
Four sesame seeds

461
00:19:35,000 --> 00:19:37,460
Take your time

462
00:19:35,530 --> 00:19:38,860
Five rockets

463
00:19:38,860 --> 00:19:44,440
Six turkeys

464
00:19:43,110 --> 00:19:45,100
How is that possible?

465
00:19:45,790 --> 00:19:47,750
OUT

466
00:19:48,060 --> 00:19:51,350
It's impossible

467
00:19:50,730 --> 00:19:52,140
It's too big

468
00:19:51,950 --> 00:19:57,710
In summary
the challenge of 6 turkeys has been upgraded to LEVEL10

469
00:19:58,270 --> 00:20:00,030
It's not suitable

470
00:20:00,030 --> 00:20:01,080
Too crafty

471
00:20:01,080 --> 00:20:03,410
In the end, it was too much

472
00:20:03,410 --> 00:20:04,870
This is too difficult

473
00:20:04,870 --> 00:20:06,280
Its shocking

474
00:20:06,280 --> 00:20:10,470
Hamada was constantly talking about the purple pig in the middle

475
00:20:10,470 --> 00:20:12,490
People are not livestock

476
00:20:12,490 --> 00:20:15,090
An expression that others purposely avoid

477
00:20:17,260 --> 00:20:19,550
Hamada is behind the times

478
00:20:20,100 --> 00:20:21,900
Really is

479
00:20:21,900 --> 00:20:24,100
This shouldn't be done

480
00:20:24,100 --> 00:20:26,700
He's from the time that mobile phones were all like this

481
00:20:27,270 --> 00:20:29,030
Telephones were carried

482
00:20:33,910 --> 00:20:37,310
Let's welcome the next presenter

483
00:20:40,780 --> 00:20:42,150
Who is it?

484
00:20:42,690 --> 00:20:46,660
Impulse's Itakura

485
00:20:49,360 --> 00:20:50,860
Let me ask something

486
00:20:51,050 --> 00:20:55,200
Do you like gossip?

487
00:20:55,200 --> 00:20:56,930
If I have to say, I think I do

488
00:20:56,930 --> 00:21:00,640
Today's topic is related to gossip, and it's this:

489
00:21:00,640 --> 00:21:09,510
When hearing amazing gossip, you'll drop what you're doing and focus on listening

490
00:21:11,380 --> 00:21:12,580
I see

491
00:21:12,850 --> 00:21:16,890
Given the ease of hearing real gossip in the industry

492
00:21:16,890 --> 00:21:19,990
This time, we chose a coffee shop inside TBS to verify the location

493
00:21:19,990 --> 00:21:20,690
It is indeed easy to hear

494
00:21:20,890 --> 00:21:22,430
Would you listen to it?

495
00:21:22,430 --> 00:21:25,600
Indeed, if someone is talking while i'm waiting

496
00:21:25,600 --> 00:21:27,530
I'll certainly listen

497
00:21:27,530 --> 00:21:29,030
Yeah

498
00:21:29,300 --> 00:21:33,940
Actresses often talk to the makeup artist, right?
-Yes

499
00:21:34,440 --> 00:21:36,110
Makeup artists talk a lot

500
00:21:36,110 --> 00:21:38,710
It's true that make-up artists have a lot of material

501
00:21:38,800 --> 00:21:42,910
They love to spread gossip

502
00:21:44,110 --> 00:21:52,660
When hearing amazing gossip, you'll drop what you're doing and focus on listening

503
00:21:52,990 --> 00:21:55,090
Therefore, this time

504
00:21:55,090 --> 00:22:01,800
We called the test subjects to the coffee shop inside TBS under the guise of a fake meeting

505
00:22:02,600 --> 00:22:08,670
The agent calls them to inform a change of location

506
00:22:09,340 --> 00:22:13,340
They must get to a new location as soon as possible

507
00:22:13,340 --> 00:22:14,980
In this case

508
00:22:14,980 --> 00:22:18,650
Even in spite of this, will they stay and listen to gossip?

509
00:22:18,650 --> 00:22:22,690
We will verify if they can be forced to hang around and listen

510
00:22:24,320 --> 00:22:26,390
The first target is

511
00:22:30,660 --> 00:22:34,470
Kamaitachi's Hamaye

512
00:22:35,130 --> 00:22:41,370
Attempting to keep him in place is his partner Yamauchi

513
00:22:41,810 --> 00:22:44,440
What kind of gossip are you going to use

514
00:22:44,440 --> 00:22:51,080
People in the industry and actresses sleeping with each other

515
00:22:51,350 --> 00:22:56,320
I'm going to use this type of scandalous content

516
00:22:57,120 --> 00:23:02,560
So, here's the gossip conversation next door

517
00:23:03,390 --> 00:23:07,530
Their TV series finished, right?

518
00:23:07,530 --> 00:23:10,700
There was a celebration party after it ended

519
00:23:10,930 --> 00:23:12,570
The relationship between us heated up

520
00:23:12,570 --> 00:23:15,340
After the party, you know, one thing lead to another

521
00:23:15,340 --> 00:23:19,180
I went to an actresses' place
-Really?

522
00:23:19,180 --> 00:23:21,010
What? Really? An actress?

523
00:23:21,010 --> 00:23:22,410
Isn't that impressive?

524
00:23:22,410 --> 00:23:23,680
Awesome, what the hell?

525
00:23:24,480 --> 00:23:25,750
Who?

526
00:23:25,750 --> 00:23:31,220
I'll tell you later who it was

527
00:23:31,890 --> 00:23:35,690
At this point, the strategy is to use a key name to hook him

528
00:23:35,690 --> 00:23:38,630
And keep the target rooted firmly in place

529
00:23:38,430 --> 00:23:40,060
Totally listening

530
00:23:39,400 --> 00:23:45,740
I have a feeling he'll stay to hear the name...

531
00:23:45,740 --> 00:23:47,770
He'll definitely be super interested

532
00:23:49,540 --> 00:23:53,480
The one always in those TV commercials

533
00:23:53,480 --> 00:23:56,480
A superb one

534
00:23:54,910 --> 00:23:56,550
A little glance

535
00:23:56,480 --> 00:23:57,480
Already listening now

536
00:23:57,480 --> 00:24:00,550
Also confirmed the other side's face

537
00:24:00,550 --> 00:24:03,020
This is the bait, right?

538
00:24:03,020 --> 00:24:05,390
Wondering what the other side looks like

539
00:24:03,450 --> 00:24:07,990
Which is when his agent begins contacting him
-Hello

540
00:24:08,830 --> 00:24:11,800
Sorry, there is a slight change in the meeting location

541
00:24:11,800 --> 00:24:13,700
Changed to a meeting room on the fourth floor

542
00:24:13,700 --> 00:24:16,670
They are already there, please go there too.
-TBS?

543
00:24:16,670 --> 00:24:18,740
Yes
-Fourth floor of TBS?

544
00:24:18,740 --> 00:24:19,900
Yes, the fourth floor of TBS

545
00:24:19,900 --> 00:24:22,240
Sorry, please come quickly

546
00:24:22,240 --> 00:24:24,070
My coffee just arrived, please wait a few minutes

547
00:24:24,070 --> 00:24:26,210
Oh... OK

548
00:24:26,210 --> 00:24:29,880
Please come soon.
I'll be there as soon as I can

549
00:24:29,980 --> 00:24:32,620
Deliberately stirred the ice cubes

550
00:24:33,420 --> 00:24:36,790
Iced coffee just came or something

551
00:24:36,790 --> 00:24:40,590
That's no reason to put off a meeting

552
00:24:45,230 --> 00:24:47,260
I'll tell you what happened

553
00:24:47,260 --> 00:24:52,300
We played bingo at the party

554
00:24:52,300 --> 00:24:54,840
Coincidentally

555
00:24:54,840 --> 00:25:00,180
I got a prize

556
00:25:00,180 --> 00:25:05,150
You mean at the celebration party for the show?
-Yes, the most recent one

557
00:25:05,620 --> 00:25:09,490
As the gossip is very detailed

558
00:25:09,490 --> 00:25:12,290
The name has yet to be disclosed

559
00:25:11,590 --> 00:25:13,390
No intention to leave

560
00:25:12,560 --> 00:25:15,560
Thus, 7 minutes pass

561
00:25:14,000 --> 00:25:15,560
So long

562
00:25:15,560 --> 00:25:16,860
Making them wait so long?

563
00:25:16,190 --> 00:25:19,160
Then say "I did before too, but don't tell anyone"

564
00:25:19,160 --> 00:25:22,570
Like they had a relationship with someone else too

565
00:25:23,430 --> 00:25:27,270
Before, in other circles too

566
00:25:27,270 --> 00:25:29,170
How should I put it

567
00:25:29,170 --> 00:25:34,710
With other actresses too...
-Seriously!?

568
00:25:34,710 --> 00:25:38,050
Had a lot of luck recently

569
00:25:38,050 --> 00:25:38,620
Wait a sec

570
00:25:38,620 --> 00:25:40,950
In another group?

571
00:25:40,950 --> 00:25:42,790
With a different person?
-Yes, yes.

572
00:25:42,790 --> 00:25:44,960
What, another actress?

573
00:25:44,960 --> 00:25:47,220
Not so loud!
-Are you kidding me?

574
00:25:47,220 --> 00:25:48,990
Impressive, right?

575
00:25:48,500 --> 00:25:50,290
Not moving at all

576
00:25:48,990 --> 00:25:50,960
To what extent?

577
00:25:51,430 --> 00:25:55,130
To what extent? I'll leave that up to your imagination

578
00:25:55,130 --> 00:25:57,940
Stop messing with me

579
00:25:56,070 --> 00:25:58,800
Turned around to see the face again

580
00:25:57,940 --> 00:25:59,900
I'm not

581
00:25:59,900 --> 00:26:03,010
This is definitely a "this guy, really?" look back, right?

582
00:26:03,410 --> 00:26:05,880
An unacceptable look

583
00:26:05,880 --> 00:26:09,510
As if to say why can this guy do it but I can't

584
00:26:10,210 --> 00:26:15,920
Basically, with people in the same circle

585
00:26:13,000 --> 00:26:16,000
It's really been a long time

586
00:26:16,250 --> 00:26:21,090
I'm more active
-Oh shut up, you're too lucky

587
00:26:21,220 --> 00:26:26,100
It doesn't mean anything though, usually the other side is acting

588
00:26:26,330 --> 00:26:29,330
How can I put it? I didn't even really have to do anything

589
00:26:29,330 --> 00:26:31,800
They did all the work

590
00:26:31,800 --> 00:26:34,040
Stretching now

591
00:26:35,570 --> 00:26:37,810
Seems a bit fidgety

592
00:26:38,110 --> 00:26:40,180
Just leave already!

593
00:26:40,540 --> 00:26:43,650
The staff are still waiting for you

594
00:26:44,280 --> 00:26:48,950
Pinned in place for 10 minutes

595
00:26:49,490 --> 00:26:52,960
The iced coffee is all gone
-Really all gone

596
00:26:53,620 --> 00:26:57,390
Another phone call from the agent to hurry him

597
00:26:55,930 --> 00:26:58,630
Surely he'll have to go this time

598
00:26:58,400 --> 00:27:00,660
You haven't arrived yet, have you?
-I was just leaving. I was just leaving. Sorry

599
00:27:00,660 --> 00:27:04,070
The other side seems to have other things to do shortly

600
00:27:04,070 --> 00:27:07,770
Just asked if we can change the time

601
00:27:07,770 --> 00:27:09,410
The other side seems a bit...

602
00:27:09,710 --> 00:27:11,940
I've finished my coffee

603
00:27:11,940 --> 00:27:12,980
Fourth floor?

604
00:27:12,980 --> 00:27:16,950
Fourth floor, please come quick
-Okay, okay

605
00:27:16,850 --> 00:27:18,080
Go go!

606
00:27:17,710 --> 00:27:20,820
Although he said on the phone he was leaving, however

607
00:27:19,450 --> 00:27:21,920
Get up and go!

608
00:27:21,180 --> 00:27:23,750
Tell me about it. I'm sure it won't get out

609
00:27:22,820 --> 00:27:23,790
Not going anywhere

610
00:27:23,750 --> 00:27:27,790
Is it ok to say...?

611
00:27:27,790 --> 00:27:30,790
You've pretty much said it all already anyway, so just get on with it

612
00:27:31,530 --> 00:27:34,670
With a feeling that the name will soon be disclosed

613
00:27:34,670 --> 00:27:39,300
Will he go or not?

614
00:27:40,340 --> 00:27:44,440
Five minutes pass and he's still there

615
00:27:44,810 --> 00:27:46,940
I'll tell you if you treat me.
-No problem

616
00:27:46,940 --> 00:27:49,910
Really?
-This one's on me? No problem. It's on me

617
00:27:49,910 --> 00:27:50,850
Really?

618
00:27:50,850 --> 00:27:52,180
You want to go? Let's go

619
00:27:52,920 --> 00:27:55,320
Can I have another drink then?

620
00:27:55,090 --> 00:27:56,890
Giving up

621
00:27:55,320 --> 00:27:56,150
Ok ok

622
00:27:57,190 --> 00:28:01,000
With the promise of another drink, he grows impatient

623
00:27:57,250 --> 00:27:59,320
Have another drink

624
00:27:59,860 --> 00:28:01,760
Understandable

625
00:28:01,000 --> 00:28:03,560
And gets up to leave

626
00:28:02,590 --> 00:28:04,860
He can't exactly ask

627
00:28:07,360 --> 00:28:08,600
16 minutes

628
00:28:08,600 --> 00:28:11,200
So, the truth is revealed

629
00:28:12,900 --> 00:28:15,010
How long do we have to wait?

630
00:28:15,840 --> 00:28:17,010
Shame on you

631
00:28:16,870 --> 00:28:19,540
How long will the staff have to wait?

632
00:28:18,410 --> 00:28:19,540
So embarrassing

633
00:28:19,540 --> 00:28:21,610
What what?

634
00:28:21,610 --> 00:28:23,850
Listening to gossip the whole time!

635
00:28:23,850 --> 00:28:26,180
No, no, no. What are those two people doing?

636
00:28:23,880 --> 00:28:25,420
This is too humiliating

637
00:28:26,180 --> 00:28:29,450
So much attention paid to an AV star
-They're gone...

638
00:28:29,450 --> 00:28:31,220
What's going on here?

639
00:28:31,220 --> 00:28:33,720
Waited so long!

640
00:28:34,020 --> 00:28:36,030
Ah you surprised me

641
00:28:36,030 --> 00:28:39,630
Do you know what this is?
-Wednesday

642
00:28:39,630 --> 00:28:42,300
Wednesday Downtown
- Yes, Wednesday Downtown

643
00:28:42,300 --> 00:28:45,170
It can only be this one. This is TBS, after all

644
00:28:45,470 --> 00:28:49,170
So the verification was explained

645
00:28:50,140 --> 00:28:52,980
You'd definitely be interested!

646
00:28:52,980 --> 00:28:56,310
You can't say you wouldn't
-Why wouldn't you leave?

647
00:28:56,450 --> 00:28:59,950
I intended to leave as soon as I heard one piece of information

648
00:29:00,180 --> 00:29:03,050
But they just wouldn't reveal a key point

649
00:29:03,750 --> 00:29:09,690
So, Kamaitachi's Hamaye stays for 16 minutes and 28 seconds

650
00:29:05,320 --> 00:29:07,190
A long record!

651
00:29:07,790 --> 00:29:10,690
Way too long!

652
00:29:10,290 --> 00:29:13,260
The next target is

653
00:29:16,830 --> 00:29:20,570
Tsutsumishita

654
00:29:20,570 --> 00:29:24,310
Listen to me, this is a big deal
-What?

655
00:29:24,310 --> 00:29:27,480
A show may be shelved

656
00:29:27,480 --> 00:29:28,880
A TV show?
-Yes

657
00:29:28,880 --> 00:29:30,210
Really? What's going on?

658
00:29:30,210 --> 00:29:34,350
The performer didn't show up yesterday to shoot

659
00:29:31,580 --> 00:29:32,780
Seems concerned

660
00:29:34,350 --> 00:29:36,820
5 or 10 minutes is understandable

661
00:29:36,820 --> 00:29:39,060
But they still didn't turn up after 2 hours
-Really?

662
00:29:39,260 --> 00:29:42,590
Listening intently

663
00:29:43,160 --> 00:29:49,230
When hooked on the gossip, the call is made to state the location change

664
00:29:52,100 --> 00:29:55,810
The challenge beings

665
00:29:57,710 --> 00:29:59,880
Guess what?
-What?

666
00:29:59,880 --> 00:30:03,510
They were arrested.
-Arrested? Really?

667
00:30:03,510 --> 00:30:05,820
Why? Why?
-Drugs

668
00:30:03,850 --> 00:30:05,450
You'd definitely listen

669
00:30:08,490 --> 00:30:11,090
His expression is too funny

670
00:30:10,520 --> 00:30:13,660
Who was it?
-I'll tell you later

671
00:30:13,660 --> 00:30:16,690
Why are you acting like that?
-No, no, isn't this a bit too big of a deal?

672
00:30:14,120 --> 00:30:16,060
So concerned

673
00:30:16,830 --> 00:30:19,530
Not moving at all

674
00:30:19,200 --> 00:30:21,460
Looks like a cop

675
00:30:20,300 --> 00:30:24,840
Holding his coffee, he listens for 5 minutes

676
00:30:24,030 --> 00:30:25,770
What's up with his hair?
- Listening so carefully

677
00:30:25,170 --> 00:30:30,340
I used to see him at the shooting site with red eyes

678
00:30:30,670 --> 00:30:34,580
You had a hunch?
-A premonition I guess

679
00:30:32,340 --> 00:30:34,580
Complicated expression

680
00:30:34,580 --> 00:30:36,810
Everyone was talking about it being a possibility

681
00:30:37,010 --> 00:30:40,520
And the makeup artist noticed something

682
00:30:40,520 --> 00:30:42,950
Bruises on their arm

683
00:30:43,190 --> 00:30:46,020
Don't spread it

684
00:30:46,020 --> 00:30:50,690
A makeup artist with whom I have a good relationship was doing his makeup

685
00:30:50,690 --> 00:30:52,830
Well...

686
00:30:52,830 --> 00:30:55,000
This is a bit too hard to believe

687
00:30:55,000 --> 00:30:59,800
At first they thought the bruise was because they were filming an injury scene

688
00:31:00,000 --> 00:31:02,010
They thought it was painted at first

689
00:31:02,010 --> 00:31:04,640
But it wasn't at all
-So it was real then

690
00:31:04,640 --> 00:31:06,180
A real bruise

691
00:31:04,640 --> 00:31:06,180
The expression is too funny

692
00:31:06,310 --> 00:31:08,110
Listen way too carefully

693
00:31:08,110 --> 00:31:09,680
So funny!

694
00:31:09,680 --> 00:31:10,410
Seriously listening

695
00:31:10,410 --> 00:31:12,850
Doesn't that guy have a girlfriend?

696
00:31:12,850 --> 00:31:16,190
Not to mention his girlfriend, he has a wife.
-Really?

697
00:31:16,190 --> 00:31:17,090
Then isn't it over?

698
00:31:17,090 --> 00:31:18,320
His eyes are moving

699
00:31:22,930 --> 00:31:23,830
Too good to not listen to

700
00:31:23,830 --> 00:31:26,130
This guy is so simple

701
00:31:26,130 --> 00:31:28,230
He's in another world!

702
00:31:28,100 --> 00:31:30,200
He's searching

703
00:31:30,200 --> 00:31:32,470
Searching on Google

704
00:31:34,340 --> 00:31:39,510
Trying to find the answer online with the clues he's just heard

705
00:31:40,210 --> 00:31:42,980
Of course, it's impossible to find it

706
00:31:43,580 --> 00:31:46,550
After that, 6 minutes passed

707
00:31:47,050 --> 00:31:48,180
At this point

708
00:31:48,180 --> 00:31:49,420
It's almost time to go

709
00:31:50,350 --> 00:31:54,420
Looking at his watch, Tsutsumishita finally gets up from his seat

710
00:31:53,920 --> 00:31:56,290
14 minutes and 55 seconds

711
00:31:56,290 --> 00:31:57,730
It's already 15 minutes

712
00:31:57,730 --> 00:32:01,930
Okay, I said tell me the name
-Really?

713
00:32:08,640 --> 00:32:12,780
Unexpectedly, he comes back

714
00:32:12,940 --> 00:32:14,440
What are you doing back?

715
00:32:15,310 --> 00:32:17,480
Regardless of whether it's fake or not, what is he coming back for?

716
00:32:18,150 --> 00:32:20,720
Although I would like to tell you, it's difficult to say

717
00:32:20,720 --> 00:32:22,650
I can't be the one to say it

718
00:32:22,650 --> 00:32:24,750
Guess.
-Eh...

719
00:32:24,750 --> 00:32:26,990
If you guess right, I'll tell you everything

720
00:32:27,720 --> 00:32:33,500
As he understands the answer is a long way away

721
00:32:31,930 --> 00:32:34,200
Given up

722
00:32:33,500 --> 00:32:35,400
He leaves again

723
00:32:42,870 --> 00:32:43,840
What happened?

724
00:32:43,840 --> 00:32:45,780
What do you think work is?

725
00:32:45,940 --> 00:32:48,140
Haven't you figured out to be grateful for work?

726
00:32:48,140 --> 00:32:50,250
Don't you get it?

727
00:32:50,910 --> 00:32:52,750
I'm very grateful. Of course I'm very grateful

728
00:32:52,750 --> 00:32:55,720
But this is a great topic

729
00:32:54,950 --> 00:32:56,590
What a horrible look in his eyes

730
00:32:55,890 --> 00:32:57,490
If its work, you should go straight away

731
00:32:57,490 --> 00:33:01,160
Impossible, everyone will be like this, right? You'd want to continue listening to it

732
00:33:01,160 --> 00:33:07,730
No, you think that since you said you were here, when you were informed of the change of location

733
00:33:07,730 --> 00:33:11,300
You'd be giving in to the other party

734
00:33:11,300 --> 00:33:13,870
So it's okay for you to stay here and listen for a while, right?

735
00:33:13,870 --> 00:33:15,470
I don't think I'm giving in to the other person

736
00:33:16,140 --> 00:33:23,610
With 15 minutes and 21 seconds, they take second place

737
00:33:22,950 --> 00:33:24,710
Hamaye is still in a strong position

738
00:33:25,520 --> 00:33:34,290
Magical-lovely's Murakami is the next target

739
00:33:35,230 --> 00:33:41,030
I'm focusing on a super painful topic about young artists

740
00:33:41,030 --> 00:33:43,430
How to say...

741
00:33:43,430 --> 00:33:46,900
The hot topic backstage is usually this

742
00:33:47,240 --> 00:33:53,640
But before that, something happened that caused a lot of headaches

743
00:33:53,640 --> 00:33:54,310
What?

744
00:33:54,310 --> 00:34:01,890
There was a special casting call for new performers

745
00:34:01,890 --> 00:34:02,650
You've mentioned it before

746
00:34:02,650 --> 00:34:04,420
That's right

747
00:34:05,160 --> 00:34:10,460
A new performer did something stupid.
-Who is it?

748
00:34:10,460 --> 00:34:16,500
Who? You may not have heard of them. It's a young artist, I don't know if they've been on TV

749
00:34:16,900 --> 00:34:19,940
I don't know if he's ever been on TV, but the way he wore the mask was so eye-catching

750
00:34:20,100 --> 00:34:21,840
Who is it? Is it a group?

751
00:34:21,840 --> 00:34:24,540
It's a group.

752
00:34:24,540 --> 00:34:25,380
9 Street Retro

753
00:34:25,380 --> 00:34:26,540
9 Street?

754
00:34:26,540 --> 00:34:26,880
9 Street

755
00:34:26,880 --> 00:34:28,180
9 what?

756
00:34:28,180 --> 00:34:29,280
9 Street Retro

757
00:34:29,370 --> 00:34:33,550
He's listening very carefully

758
00:34:32,650 --> 00:34:34,080
He looked back

759
00:34:33,880 --> 00:34:38,660
This time, the name of the junior group that he might be interested in is disclosed first

760
00:34:38,990 --> 00:34:43,430
The battle plan is to keep him with the promise of a stupid act

761
00:34:44,230 --> 00:34:49,270
The call to change location takes place

762
00:34:49,270 --> 00:34:51,400
The 4th floor conference room

763
00:34:52,500 --> 00:34:55,410
The challenge begins

764
00:34:56,070 --> 00:34:59,540
They did it again, put the show on pause

765
00:34:59,540 --> 00:35:00,210
Oh really

766
00:35:01,380 --> 00:35:03,980
It was really unfunny, seriously

767
00:35:04,210 --> 00:35:08,450
Someone came, Kyo I think it was

768
00:35:08,450 --> 00:35:14,320
It was terrible

769
00:35:14,320 --> 00:35:15,960
Super awful

770
00:35:16,490 --> 00:35:17,990
He really did something stupid

771
00:35:17,990 --> 00:35:19,330
A stupid thing

772
00:35:19,330 --> 00:35:23,370
They called his manager

773
00:35:23,370 --> 00:35:24,800
Called the firm?

774
00:35:24,800 --> 00:35:27,500
Really dumb as hell

775
00:35:27,500 --> 00:35:28,440
Which office?

776
00:35:29,770 --> 00:35:33,380
Although Murakami also seems to care about the gossip

777
00:35:33,380 --> 00:35:38,310
After receiving the call, he left his seat after only 40 seconds

778
00:35:38,250 --> 00:35:39,620
Basically left right away

779
00:35:39,720 --> 00:35:42,190
Seriously!?

780
00:35:48,190 --> 00:35:50,060
Hello

781
00:35:50,060 --> 00:35:52,760
What the hell?

782
00:35:52,760 --> 00:35:53,730
What's going on?

783
00:35:53,730 --> 00:35:57,070
It's too fast

784
00:35:57,070 --> 00:35:59,370
I'm serious

785
00:35:59,500 --> 00:36:02,240
I guess I should've stayed

786
00:36:02,240 --> 00:36:06,210
Did you care about what happened?
-Of course

787
00:36:06,210 --> 00:36:10,680
This is your favorite topic, right?
-I like it a lot

788
00:36:10,680 --> 00:36:12,750
Then don't leave. Keep listening

789
00:36:12,920 --> 00:36:20,190
You know I don't want to make anyone angry, don't you?

790
00:36:20,190 --> 00:36:21,120
Don't you know that?

791
00:36:21,320 --> 00:36:24,090
So you think of not making people angry first?

792
00:36:24,790 --> 00:36:27,700
The final target is...

793
00:36:31,500 --> 00:36:37,810
Morita, a famous gossip lover in the entertainment industry

794
00:36:39,310 --> 00:36:42,610
You give the impression that you like to gossip a lot

795
00:36:42,610 --> 00:36:43,880
Yes, he does

796
00:36:43,880 --> 00:36:47,520
Kojima of our firm

797
00:36:47,520 --> 00:36:51,390
I don't think he does it anymore...

798
00:36:52,320 --> 00:36:56,130
It's impossible for Morita not to listen

799
00:36:56,130 --> 00:36:57,530
He loves it

800
00:36:57,990 --> 00:37:02,600
I'm sure he'll be interested and keep listening

801
00:37:02,600 --> 00:37:08,370
He's the type that actively seeks out gossip

802
00:37:09,270 --> 00:37:12,140
The gossip prepared for Morita is...

803
00:37:13,210 --> 00:37:17,180
Speaking of which, some time ago

804
00:37:17,180 --> 00:37:20,580
I slept with a comedian

805
00:37:20,580 --> 00:37:24,090
Eh, wait, a comedian?

806
00:37:25,460 --> 00:37:28,460
Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait. Really?

807
00:37:28,460 --> 00:37:31,490
Who? Who? Who is it? I'm curious

808
00:37:31,490 --> 00:37:34,030
Well...

809
00:37:34,030 --> 00:37:35,700
I'll tell you the name later

810
00:37:35,700 --> 00:37:38,640
Eh, wait, I'm so curious

811
00:37:38,740 --> 00:37:40,240
Wait a minute

812
00:37:40,240 --> 00:37:42,970
He's already looking

813
00:37:42,970 --> 00:37:46,580
He wont be leaving anytime soon

814
00:37:47,140 --> 00:37:48,710
Oh really?

815
00:37:48,710 --> 00:37:51,950
Yes, yes, I would like you to come to the fourth floor.
-Got it

816
00:37:55,690 --> 00:37:57,990
Wait, wait, wait, wait

817
00:37:57,990 --> 00:37:59,860
What's going on?

818
00:37:59,860 --> 00:38:02,060
I was on a program

819
00:38:02,060 --> 00:38:06,560
Was out of town for a day

820
00:38:06,560 --> 00:38:10,400
We got to know each other very well when we talked

821
00:38:10,400 --> 00:38:12,370
So we exchanged Lines

822
00:38:12,370 --> 00:38:16,010
In order not to miss any important gossip

823
00:38:16,010 --> 00:38:18,780
Morita is firmly stuck in place

824
00:38:19,380 --> 00:38:22,580
And so five minutes passed

825
00:38:22,180 --> 00:38:24,180
He wants to see what they look like

826
00:38:24,980 --> 00:38:27,620
It's the 4th floor.
-Okay, I'll be right there

827
00:38:27,620 --> 00:38:30,250
The other party is waiting. Please come down quickly

828
00:38:30,250 --> 00:38:32,960
Okay, okay

829
00:38:33,220 --> 00:38:36,690
Hurry up

830
00:38:37,660 --> 00:38:38,830
Then

831
00:38:39,460 --> 00:38:42,030
Not sure if this is the kind of thing I should say
-Out with it!

832
00:38:42,030 --> 00:38:45,600
Famous then?
-Probably...

833
00:38:45,700 --> 00:38:47,500
Ah, he's picked up his bag

834
00:38:47,770 --> 00:38:50,740
Actually, there's one more person

835
00:38:51,040 --> 00:38:57,750
Actually, there's another comedian
-Wait a minute

836
00:38:57,750 --> 00:39:01,050
A bit scary...

837
00:39:01,050 --> 00:39:02,590
I'm super curious

838
00:39:02,590 --> 00:39:05,220
Who? Tell me one

839
00:39:05,660 --> 00:39:07,360
I'm so jealous

840
00:39:08,690 --> 00:39:11,160
He put his bag down

841
00:39:11,160 --> 00:39:14,460
Because now there are two "suspects"

842
00:39:15,900 --> 00:39:16,470
Hey, hey!

843
00:39:16,470 --> 00:39:19,340
What are you doing? What are you doing?

844
00:39:19,340 --> 00:39:23,170
A little bit...

845
00:39:23,170 --> 00:39:28,080
In the table over

846
00:39:28,080 --> 00:39:30,580
I'll send you a Line

847
00:39:30,750 --> 00:39:32,620
He's sending a message

848
00:39:32,620 --> 00:39:34,220
It's from Morita

849
00:39:34,220 --> 00:39:37,950
Please wait a little longer. I'm receiving gossip now

850
00:39:37,950 --> 00:39:40,490
A tone like it's part of the job

851
00:39:40,490 --> 00:39:43,290
Stupid, hurry up and come to the meeting!

852
00:39:43,290 --> 00:39:46,960
Saying that you are receiving gossip is not something you should say

853
00:39:47,430 --> 00:39:50,630
He thinks its work
-That's his job, in Morita's opinion

854
00:39:50,770 --> 00:39:56,810
Didn't you just say there was another person?
-Who is it?

855
00:39:57,410 --> 00:40:06,320
Actually, it's that person's partner
-Really?

856
00:40:06,320 --> 00:40:10,690
Wait, you slept with both of them?
-Yes

857
00:40:13,820 --> 00:40:18,260
An unexpected "combo meal" of information

858
00:40:18,260 --> 00:40:21,760
Morita can't leave without it

859
00:40:21,760 --> 00:40:23,200
And

860
00:40:23,670 --> 00:40:28,200
A microphone is their avatar

861
00:40:30,240 --> 00:40:32,280
If you look at it, you will know, right?

862
00:40:32,280 --> 00:40:35,010
Can you guess the name?

863
00:40:36,180 --> 00:40:39,580
What type are they?

864
00:40:39,580 --> 00:40:41,620
What type?

865
00:40:42,080 --> 00:40:45,050
A Kansai vibe

866
00:40:45,190 --> 00:40:50,530
Their look is really Kansai.
-Oh, Kansai faces?

867
00:40:50,530 --> 00:40:51,660
Kansai face?

868
00:40:51,130 --> 00:40:52,460
He's thinking

869
00:40:52,460 --> 00:40:55,630
With the sudden appearance of a riddle

870
00:40:55,630 --> 00:40:57,970
Morita racks his brain

871
00:40:59,200 --> 00:41:03,070
Wait, just now...
-What's wrong? Did he send you a message?

872
00:41:03,340 --> 00:41:08,040
Excited? Which one is it? The first or the second?

873
00:41:09,880 --> 00:41:18,620
He said a live broadcast will be over soon and asked if we could meet afterwards

874
00:41:13,880 --> 00:41:16,120
Big clue, live broadcast

875
00:41:18,860 --> 00:41:20,290
Which one is it?

876
00:41:20,290 --> 00:41:21,920
This one

877
00:41:21,920 --> 00:41:24,030
Thinking carefully

878
00:41:25,560 --> 00:41:29,370
Programs are spinning in his head

879
00:41:29,570 --> 00:41:31,530
Wait, the other one also sent a message

880
00:41:31,530 --> 00:41:35,940
Eh, so exciting, so interesting

881
00:41:33,800 --> 00:41:38,270
Good performance

882
00:41:36,310 --> 00:41:39,580
How about meeting after the live broadcast?

883
00:41:39,580 --> 00:41:42,610
Do both of them want to meet alone?

884
00:41:45,750 --> 00:41:50,750
They want to meet afterwards. It should be a one-on-one

885
00:41:51,750 --> 00:41:55,690
Stuck in place for 16 minutes

886
00:41:55,690 --> 00:41:56,730
At this point

887
00:41:57,160 --> 00:41:58,660
Which one?

888
00:41:58,660 --> 00:42:02,670
Which one do you like more?

889
00:42:00,030 --> 00:42:04,630
It's really time to go

890
00:42:02,670 --> 00:42:05,540
Which one?

891
00:42:05,540 --> 00:42:11,840
If I have to say...

892
00:42:13,180 --> 00:42:14,410
The one who plays dumb

893
00:42:14,510 --> 00:42:17,080
Which one's that?

894
00:42:17,080 --> 00:42:19,380
The one who says stuipid stuff

895
00:42:19,750 --> 00:42:21,480
He's shaking his leg

896
00:42:21,480 --> 00:42:23,550
In a hurry

897
00:42:21,550 --> 00:42:26,420
Waiting for the name still, he reaches the peak of his impatience

898
00:42:25,320 --> 00:42:26,720
Said nothing

899
00:42:26,720 --> 00:42:28,390
Too good to not listen

900
00:42:26,960 --> 00:42:29,590
Then I'll give you a hint

901
00:42:29,590 --> 00:42:33,400
The combo name has "ma" in it

902
00:42:36,100 --> 00:42:41,270
Who comes to mind?

903
00:42:41,270 --> 00:42:42,310
Hearing this

904
00:42:42,310 --> 00:42:44,710
Usually a name would come to mind

905
00:42:44,710 --> 00:42:48,480
"Ma"... who is it?

906
00:42:48,480 --> 00:42:50,680
Ma mi mu me mo?

907
00:42:50,680 --> 00:42:54,350
Is it only "ma" or is it "ma mi mu me mo"?

908
00:42:54,680 --> 00:42:58,420
Sorry, thanks for your hard work

909
00:42:59,890 --> 00:43:01,390
Eh, who is this?

910
00:43:01,390 --> 00:43:05,900
You were talking about comedians, right?
-Yes

911
00:43:06,030 --> 00:43:08,930
I've been listening

912
00:43:08,930 --> 00:43:11,670
Is it Mitorizu?

913
00:43:13,900 --> 00:43:15,240
Mitorizu

914
00:43:17,040 --> 00:43:20,310
Why do they come to mind?

915
00:43:20,610 --> 00:43:25,110
I can't say
-I don't mean anything by it, just wondering

916
00:43:25,110 --> 00:43:27,120
I was just listening, sorry

917
00:43:27,120 --> 00:43:31,250
Is it Mitorizu?
-I can't really say

918
00:43:31,250 --> 00:43:32,960
Can't say

919
00:43:33,490 --> 00:43:37,030
So the truth is revealed

920
00:43:37,030 --> 00:43:39,230
If you do not hurry to the meeting

921
00:43:39,230 --> 00:43:40,030
What are you doing?

922
00:43:40,030 --> 00:43:41,600
Wait a minute. What's going on?
-People are waiting

923
00:43:41,600 --> 00:43:44,330
What's going on here?

924
00:43:44,330 --> 00:43:48,370
Hurry up and go to the 4th floor!
-I'm going there now. I'm going there

925
00:43:48,370 --> 00:43:50,610
What's going on here?

926
00:43:50,610 --> 00:43:52,840
The meeting is about to start

927
00:43:52,940 --> 00:43:55,140
You're being rushed but you won't rush over

928
00:43:55,140 --> 00:43:55,810
Why don't you leave?

929
00:43:55,810 --> 00:44:01,050
No, I'm going to go, although, but I love gossip

930
00:44:01,050 --> 00:44:02,520
It's more like...

931
00:44:02,520 --> 00:44:04,690
When work is being done
-Yes

932
00:44:04,690 --> 00:44:06,660
This is also work

933
00:44:06,660 --> 00:44:07,560
When all is said and done

934
00:44:08,160 --> 00:44:11,330
It's work, too. That's how it is

935
00:44:11,330 --> 00:44:12,930
Its as important

936
00:44:12,930 --> 00:44:17,170
In terms of the weight of the work
-What is the weight?

937
00:44:17,170 --> 00:44:20,340
If you look at the content of the conversation, this side obviously carries more weight

938
00:44:20,700 --> 00:44:24,870
Therefore, the first place winner is Morita

939
00:44:24,870 --> 00:44:27,940
The power of gossip is indeed great

940
00:44:28,440 --> 00:44:31,050
So that's how it is

941
00:44:31,050 --> 00:44:33,050
What do you think?

942
00:44:33,050 --> 00:44:36,950
Morita is a master of gossip

943
00:44:36,950 --> 00:44:39,260
Really, when you meet me in the hallway, if you say, "Tell me something."

944
00:44:39,260 --> 00:44:41,420
Gossip comes up straight away

945
00:44:41,420 --> 00:44:42,530
It's true

946
00:44:42,530 --> 00:44:43,440
Very impressive

947
00:44:43,450 --> 00:44:46,410
I feel more trustworthy now after watching this

948
00:44:47,260 --> 00:44:48,700
Is it really like this?

949
00:44:49,300 --> 00:44:50,670
Aside from the promise of a name

950
00:44:50,670 --> 00:44:53,270
The type of gossip is important for the setup

951
00:44:53,270 --> 00:44:56,140
Doesn't matter if its implausible

952
00:44:56,140 --> 00:44:59,540
I think it's perfectly fine to use an actual name, right?

953
00:44:59,540 --> 00:45:00,380
True

954
00:45:00,380 --> 00:45:03,010
Just censor the name or something

955
00:45:03,010 --> 00:45:04,710
After all, it is not true

956
00:45:04,710 --> 00:45:05,920
Indeed

957
00:45:05,920 --> 00:45:07,820
For example, "Hamada cheated with such and such"

958
00:45:07,820 --> 00:45:09,440
I think it's okay to say

959
00:45:10,690 --> 00:45:11,690
Yes, it's okay

960
00:45:12,780 --> 00:45:15,560
That's a bad example

961
00:45:15,560 --> 00:45:17,760
But I think it's okay to say a name

962
00:45:18,460 --> 00:45:21,230
We have also finished filming a second edition

963
00:45:21,600 --> 00:45:24,900
The wives of comedians having affairs

964
00:45:25,100 --> 00:45:27,640
Look forward to it!

965
00:45:28,140 --> 00:46:14,750
