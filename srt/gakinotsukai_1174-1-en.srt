1
00:00:06,420 --> 00:00:12,000
I was watching the back of Yamasaki's head the whole time before we started.

2
00:00:12,770 --> 00:00:14,200
C'mon, stop that!

3
00:00:14,200 --> 00:00:18,260
There's nothing wrong with looking at it

4
00:00:16,860 --> 00:00:20,260
He was really staring at the crown of your head

5
00:00:20,260 --> 00:00:22,150
What did you think when you looked at it?

6
00:00:22,150 --> 00:00:25,250
I thought "it must feel nice and breezy"

7
00:00:25,250 --> 00:00:28,680
It's not really that breezy. This part is breezy though.

8
00:00:29,120 --> 00:00:32,600
He was like, half smirking while staring

9
00:00:32,600 --> 00:00:36,720
Zaki-san uses a lot of, what do you call it,

10
00:00:36,720 --> 00:00:40,600
Anti-aging stuff I think? Right? Even before filming

11
00:00:40,600 --> 00:00:45,740
He got Fujiwara from License to apply something like this.
I asked what it was and...

12
00:00:45,740 --> 00:00:50,180
He was getting his gray hairs covered

13
00:00:48,740 --> 00:00:50,180
That is anti-aging

14
00:00:52,340 --> 00:00:55,200
Like black ink type stuff, painting his white hairs

15
00:00:55,200 --> 00:00:57,860
That mascara type thing right?

16
00:00:57,860 --> 00:01:01,620
Yamasaki was amazing, but Fujiwara was too.

17
00:01:01,620 --> 00:01:04,990
He was like a programmer

18
00:01:04,990 --> 00:01:08,560
He's getting better at it, you're asking him to do it every time after all

19
00:01:12,420 --> 00:01:18,520
Hamada-san's senility is evolving in new ways I just experienced

20
00:01:19,060 --> 00:01:20,740
Even just now, right there

21
00:01:21,360 --> 00:01:24,140
In the dressing room, after we were done talking,

22
00:01:24,140 --> 00:01:28,080
They said "It's almost time"
and handed us these to change into

23
00:01:28,080 --> 00:01:33,620
He very confidently jammed his leg into the arm part of the Tanuki costume

24
00:01:33,880 --> 00:01:37,480
"It fits so well" he said

25
00:01:39,820 --> 00:01:44,440
It's things like this that make him like [!@!@# !@#!@]

26
00:01:44,440 --> 00:01:45,360
REALLY?!

27
00:01:47,200 --> 00:01:51,100
He's going to catch up to [@#%!@ !@((%] soon

28
00:01:55,680 --> 00:01:55,680
TEXT 2

29
00:02:12,260 --> 00:02:15,460
It's been a while.

30
00:02:14,700 --> 00:02:15,460
Yes it has.

31
00:02:15,460 --> 00:02:17,830
It's been three weeks.

32
00:02:17,830 --> 00:02:21,640
Since our last meeting.

33
00:02:21,700 --> 00:02:25,340
What were you up to during then?
We all had different things going on right?

34
00:02:24,940 --> 00:02:26,820
I was-

35
00:02:25,660 --> 00:02:28,200
How many times did you [*@!$%]

36
00:02:26,800 --> 00:02:28,400
We're talking about [*@!$%]?

37
00:02:28,400 --> 00:02:30,200
C'mon tell us

38
00:02:28,940 --> 00:02:32,440
[*@!$%]? Almost never, almost never!

39
00:02:32,740 --> 00:02:35,880
Almost never?

40
00:02:35,880 --> 00:02:39,080
My mom and my dad,

41
00:02:39,080 --> 00:02:42,190
Had their 50th anniversary

42
00:02:42,190 --> 00:02:48,600
Their 50th wedding anniversary. So my mom's family, my sister's families, there were about 10 of us,

43
00:02:48,600 --> 00:02:55,240
My dad is from Kumamoto. So we went to visit our family there. All of us.

44
00:02:55,240 --> 00:02:57,680
That's quite a large group

45
00:02:57,840 --> 00:03:04,300
And the other side had 30 people

46
00:03:04,300 --> 00:03:09,920
So all 40 of us had dinner together

47
00:03:09,920 --> 00:03:11,400
And basically,

48
00:03:11,400 --> 00:03:14,740
Everyone had a bit of an underbite

49
00:03:14,740 --> 00:03:16,520
My dad's face looks exactly the same

50
00:03:16,520 --> 00:03:19,290
Only half had an underbite

51
00:03:19,290 --> 00:03:25,160
Hey, not all of my relatives have a big chin

52
00:03:23,400 --> 00:03:27,060
40 people with an underbite would be incredible

53
00:03:26,160 --> 00:03:30,040
It's just his half, so 20 people. Exactly half.

54
00:03:30,040 --> 00:03:33,910
All 8 of my dad's siblings were there

55
00:03:33,910 --> 00:03:38,620
So including grandchildren, around 40 people

56
00:03:38,620 --> 00:03:40,020
A dinner party

57
00:03:42,640 --> 00:03:45,580
There was a toast at the beginning,

58
00:03:45,580 --> 00:03:49,340
There was a person from the Kumamoto side, who said since we came from Osaka,

59
00:03:49,340 --> 00:03:53,190
My dad is called Goji. He said "Goji-san, please do the honours"

60
00:03:53,430 --> 00:03:59,260
My dad really doesn't like doing things like that

61
00:03:57,260 --> 00:03:59,260
Yeah, he's a reserved man

62
00:03:59,260 --> 00:04:02,540
He was asked a while ago,

63
00:04:02,900 --> 00:04:08,240
In our neighborhood there was a summer karaoke competition

64
00:04:08,240 --> 00:04:12,420
And my dad was the MC, and he isn't that type of guy at all,

65
00:04:12,420 --> 00:04:16,820
And you couldn't hear him when he talked. And this drunk guy said,

66
00:04:16,820 --> 00:04:18,650
"We can't hear you man!"

67
00:04:18,650 --> 00:04:22,960
And as a child that really hurt me

68
00:04:22,960 --> 00:04:25,640
Seeing my dad getting humiliated

69
00:04:25,640 --> 00:04:28,020
That's something you don't want to see

70
00:04:28,020 --> 00:04:31,350
That's the last thing you want to see

71
00:04:34,940 --> 00:04:39,540
He was doing the toast in front of 40 people,

72
00:04:39,540 --> 00:04:42,160
I was worried if he'd be alright

73
00:04:42,160 --> 00:04:46,850
But maybe he's gotten better with time

74
00:04:48,780 --> 00:04:51,320
He got the glass, and everyone was standing,

75
00:04:51,740 --> 00:04:54,860
And he greeted them
"This time, this night,

76
00:04:54,860 --> 00:04:57,760
I'm glad we were able to get together after so long

77
00:04:57,760 --> 00:05:01,380
"So tonight let's enjoy ourselves!"
and he was speaking loudly

78
00:05:01,380 --> 00:05:07,680
"Let's enjoy ourselves! Kanpai!" - everyone replied "Kanpai!"
And when they started to sit down, my dad started talking,

79
00:05:07,680 --> 00:05:12,180
"I was born in Kumamoto"
And THAT'S when he started talking, and for so long

80
00:05:12,180 --> 00:05:14,980
He got the order backwards, the cheers and the speech

81
00:05:12,960 --> 00:05:14,980
He spoke forever

82
00:05:14,980 --> 00:05:20,520
Everyone almost sat down and then got back up

83
00:05:20,520 --> 00:05:24,720
He's not used to it

84
00:05:24,960 --> 00:05:31,360
He's not used to it
And the speech too, like nobody was really paying attention...

85
00:05:31,700 --> 00:05:34,680
That pisses me off

86
00:05:34,680 --> 00:05:37,340
He's not used to it

87
00:05:35,800 --> 00:05:37,340
It pisses me off, for real

88
00:05:37,340 --> 00:05:40,230
But the relatives,

89
00:05:40,230 --> 00:05:44,270
They said they love the "No Laughing" series

90
00:05:44,270 --> 00:05:47,680
An 86 year old grandfather asked me,

91
00:05:47,680 --> 00:05:51,200
Does the Thai Kick really hurt?

92
00:05:51,200 --> 00:05:52,500
He's concerned for you

93
00:05:52,500 --> 00:05:54,650
86 years old!

94
00:05:54,650 --> 00:05:57,340
It'll definitely hurt for him

95
00:05:57,340 --> 00:06:04,450
It's the first time I've heard an 86 year old say the words "Thai Kick"

96
00:06:05,450 --> 00:06:07,900
For me I...

97
00:06:07,900 --> 00:06:09,900
Endo what do you do? Seriously

98
00:06:11,800 --> 00:06:16,760
For me I have a family, so that takes up most of my time

99
00:06:16,760 --> 00:06:19,300
Basically I just go home,

100
00:06:19,300 --> 00:06:22,960
and there's a cafe in front of my place,

101
00:06:22,960 --> 00:06:26,180
I'm usually over there

102
00:06:27,580 --> 00:06:28,600
In a cafe by yourself?

103
00:06:28,800 --> 00:06:30,800
In the cafe yes

104
00:06:29,740 --> 00:06:31,860
You don't go home?

105
00:06:30,800 --> 00:06:35,260
I go home, leave my bag at the entrance and head straight to the cafe

106
00:06:36,560 --> 00:06:39,360
Just chilling out

107
00:06:39,360 --> 00:06:41,800
There's a slightly bald guy named Jun-chan

108
00:06:41,800 --> 00:06:44,900
I just talk to him

109
00:06:45,180 --> 00:06:48,080
I go in the night a lot

110
00:06:46,160 --> 00:06:49,280
Do you eat there too?

111
00:06:48,080 --> 00:06:52,440
The food is good too, they have stuff like green curry

112
00:06:54,980 --> 00:06:58,680
The other day on a shoot for Hirunandesu

113
00:06:58,840 --> 00:07:02,700
We had to buy a lot of vegetables for a segment,

114
00:07:02,700 --> 00:07:09,240
At a superstore

115
00:07:03,300 --> 00:07:09,240
And I brought them home with me, but I didn't use them for anything

116
00:07:10,240 --> 00:07:13,030
And I went to that cafe

117
00:07:11,980 --> 00:07:13,030
Jun-chan?

118
00:07:11,980 --> 00:07:13,030
Yes Jun-chan

119
00:07:13,030 --> 00:07:17,170
And he was, I think, slightly balding

120
00:07:17,170 --> 00:07:18,730
Yes I mentioned it 1 minute ago

121
00:07:18,730 --> 00:07:22,660
He's not balding, he's bald

122
00:07:21,060 --> 00:07:22,660
Jun-chan is balding

123
00:07:23,660 --> 00:07:26,540
And I gave it to him, "Jun-chan here you go"

124
00:07:26,540 --> 00:07:29,500
"Even though you're balding"

125
00:07:30,120 --> 00:07:31,700
Could you make something with this?

126
00:07:31,700 --> 00:07:34,820
"Thank you. I'm happy even though I'm slightly balding"

127
00:07:33,680 --> 00:07:36,050
He wasn't that bald...

128
00:07:37,800 --> 00:07:42,320
It's not enough to mention it, although he is balding

129
00:07:42,320 --> 00:07:44,320
But that's about it

130
00:07:45,620 --> 00:07:47,440
What was the furthest place you went?

131
00:07:47,440 --> 00:07:51,400
In these 2 weeks? The furthest place I went to was...

132
00:07:51,520 --> 00:07:54,270
Probably Wangan Studio

133
00:07:56,180 --> 00:07:59,070
I didn't travel at all. Just the same places.

134
00:07:59,070 --> 00:08:01,910
I'm worried for Endo

135
00:08:01,910 --> 00:08:04,980
For real Hamada is always saying he's worried for Endo

136
00:08:04,120 --> 00:08:05,340
Yeah

137
00:08:04,980 --> 00:08:07,320
"What's gonna happen to him" he said, for real

138
00:08:07,320 --> 00:08:09,660
See even Atsushi

139
00:08:09,120 --> 00:08:11,060
He got married right?

140
00:08:12,420 --> 00:08:16,760
I was concerned. How will Endo's future turn out

141
00:08:16,760 --> 00:08:19,700
I do want to marry again

142
00:08:19,220 --> 00:08:20,680
Oh you want to?

143
00:08:19,840 --> 00:08:24,500
But when you do get married, will Jun-chan be able to keep quiet?

144
00:08:24,500 --> 00:08:28,040
Jun-chan and I don't have that kind of relationship

145
00:08:29,720 --> 00:08:30,840
Shut up!

146
00:08:30,840 --> 00:08:36,360
The only thing I said about Jun-chan is that he's balding. And the green curry is delicious. That's all.

147
00:08:36,360 --> 00:08:38,650
What were you imagining?

148
00:08:38,650 --> 00:08:42,860
I thought green curry was a euphemism

149
00:08:42,860 --> 00:08:47,320
Like a code word

150
00:08:50,080 --> 00:08:53,520
What the hell are you imagining

151
00:08:50,600 --> 00:08:53,520
I do want to marry again

152
00:08:54,000 --> 00:08:56,520
I really want to see what Jun-chan looks like now

153
00:08:56,520 --> 00:08:57,780
How old is Jun-chan?

154
00:08:57,780 --> 00:08:59,780
36 years old he said

155
00:09:00,620 --> 00:09:03,160
What do you like about him?

156
00:09:04,340 --> 00:09:07,280
He's a good cook, I just entered the store by chance,

157
00:09:07,820 --> 00:09:10,340
Jun-chan is a nice guy

158
00:09:10,340 --> 00:09:12,900
The cafe is open until 00:00

159
00:09:12,900 --> 00:09:15,780
The first time I went, with Wakky,

160
00:09:15,780 --> 00:09:18,700
There was nothing available and it was past midnight. We peeked inside,

161
00:09:19,000 --> 00:09:22,520
We asked if we can come in and he said of course.
And that's how it started

162
00:09:22,520 --> 00:09:26,780
That's how we got to know each other

163
00:09:26,780 --> 00:09:29,680
The start of your coming out

164
00:09:29,680 --> 00:09:31,420
And did Wakky start frequenting it too?

165
00:09:31,420 --> 00:09:36,140
Wakky's house is far, but it happens to be really near my house

166
00:09:36,140 --> 00:09:39,570
So at first it was a threesome

167
00:09:41,520 --> 00:09:43,960
That's a strange way to put it

168
00:09:43,960 --> 00:09:47,400
You're just going to a restaurant in your neighbourhood right?

169
00:09:45,420 --> 00:09:48,380
Exactly! I just checked out a nearby place

170
00:09:48,860 --> 00:09:50,650
But do you really go everyday?

171
00:09:50,650 --> 00:09:53,160
You have no feelings towards Jun-chan?

172
00:09:53,160 --> 00:09:57,000
I obviously have no feelings for someone who runs a cafe near my house,

173
00:09:57,000 --> 00:10:00,240
Plus, he's a balding old man

174
00:10:00,240 --> 00:10:03,560
A divorced old man like me,

175
00:10:03,690 --> 00:10:06,630
is not going to have anything with a balding old man

176
00:10:06,630 --> 00:10:10,470
I really really like women

177
00:10:15,560 --> 00:10:20,060
Matsumoto-san does a lot right?

178
00:10:20,060 --> 00:10:24,500
Hamada-san also went overseas,
Someone I know told me,

179
00:10:24,500 --> 00:10:29,290
Hamada-san went to Yankee stadium

180
00:10:29,480 --> 00:10:32,340
Yeah, for a TV show

181
00:10:32,340 --> 00:10:34,340
For Jump

182
00:10:34,340 --> 00:10:35,840
New York?

183
00:10:35,840 --> 00:10:37,380
What did you do?

184
00:10:37,380 --> 00:10:41,480
I spoke to the players

185
00:10:37,760 --> 00:10:41,480
Oh it was talk thing?

186
00:10:41,480 --> 00:10:44,040
Any famous players you spoke to?

187
00:10:42,420 --> 00:10:44,040
I wouldn't recognise them though

188
00:10:44,040 --> 00:10:48,410
Kuroda, Uehara, Tazawa, and Ichiro

189
00:10:48,640 --> 00:10:50,180
Ichiro?!

190
00:10:50,180 --> 00:10:52,610
Ichiro and Hamada-san...

191
00:10:52,720 --> 00:10:55,480
It's not that impressive!

192
00:10:56,140 --> 00:10:59,780
They say Ichiro is hard to talk to, he doesn't speak much

193
00:10:59,780 --> 00:11:05,380
Ichiro has a reserved image, and it's hard to interview him

194
00:11:08,160 --> 00:11:10,000
He only eats Curry right?

195
00:11:10,440 --> 00:11:13,220
There's no way that's true

196
00:11:11,180 --> 00:11:13,220
He does have a routine,

197
00:11:13,220 --> 00:11:16,560
I've heard he eats curry every morning

198
00:11:16,560 --> 00:11:19,560
He eats curry every morning? He eats curry in the morning?

199
00:11:19,560 --> 00:11:22,560
He eats some homemade curry every morning

200
00:11:22,560 --> 00:11:25,310
Isn't it amazing? It makes no sense

201
00:11:25,310 --> 00:11:29,930
He doesn't break his routine. That's his morning thing

202
00:11:29,930 --> 00:11:35,700
But still why did he decide to eat curry for his morning routine?

203
00:11:34,860 --> 00:11:37,130
He's been doing it for a long time

204
00:11:35,700 --> 00:11:38,600
I bet even Indians don't eat curry in the morning

205
00:11:40,920 --> 00:11:43,720
If I had curry from last night then I would eat it in the morning

206
00:11:44,820 --> 00:11:46,720
Try to turn it into Udon

207
00:11:45,510 --> 00:11:47,670
Try to turn it into Udon

208
00:11:46,720 --> 00:11:48,800
He eats curry rice

209
00:11:48,800 --> 00:11:51,600
Does he eat the same curry everyday?

210
00:11:51,600 --> 00:11:53,660
Or like "cutlet for today", or vegetable,

211
00:11:54,500 --> 00:11:56,410
I don't know that

212
00:11:57,700 --> 00:11:59,820
Are you even curious about that?

213
00:11:59,130 --> 00:12:00,670
Aren't you curious?

214
00:11:59,820 --> 00:12:02,640
Not at all!

215
00:12:02,640 --> 00:12:04,640
The exact same curry?

216
00:12:03,840 --> 00:12:08,300
He eats a large amount

217
00:12:04,640 --> 00:12:08,300
There's nothing special about eating it with cutlets if you have them

218
00:12:08,300 --> 00:12:09,940
The base is the same, probably

219
00:12:11,520 --> 00:12:12,580
A simple one

220
00:12:13,060 --> 00:12:15,420
Yeah so basically I just worked

221
00:12:16,180 --> 00:12:19,340
Did you do anything during your off time?

222
00:12:19,340 --> 00:12:22,340
I was free one morning so I played golf

223
00:12:25,800 --> 00:12:27,880
Golf with Ichiro?

224
00:12:27,880 --> 00:12:31,260
By yourself?

225
00:12:28,580 --> 00:12:31,260
Of course not!

226
00:12:31,260 --> 00:12:34,450
I was with the staff who came with me

227
00:12:34,450 --> 00:12:36,580
If he started playing golf alone,

228
00:12:36,580 --> 00:12:40,320
I'd think Hamada has finally lost it...

229
00:12:42,920 --> 00:12:45,920
He starts talking about losing .... It's dangerous

230
00:12:49,480 --> 00:12:53,340
You had a thing for your movie

231
00:12:50,830 --> 00:12:53,340
I went somewhere for my film

232
00:12:55,270 --> 00:12:58,160
I was fooled, by my manager Kimura

233
00:12:58,460 --> 00:13:03,720
We had to go to Canada, I asked what plane, he said ANA
And ANA is fine with me

234
00:13:03,720 --> 00:13:05,920
It's great, using a Japanese airline

235
00:13:05,920 --> 00:13:10,000
And on the day, seriously, it wasn't ANA!

236
00:13:12,000 --> 00:13:14,540
It was *** ******

237
00:13:14,540 --> 00:13:18,100
It's the goddamn worst, it had nothing!

238
00:13:18,200 --> 00:13:20,600
What do you mean?

239
00:13:18,820 --> 00:13:21,100
Like there was nothing!

240
00:13:21,100 --> 00:13:24,600
It was 12 hours! No movies or anything!

241
00:13:24,600 --> 00:13:27,540
There was a fold out screen, there was one,

242
00:13:27,800 --> 00:13:29,540
But it was in a foreign language

243
00:13:29,540 --> 00:13:31,700
There was nothing Japanese

244
00:13:32,060 --> 00:13:34,180
It was hell, 12 hours

245
00:13:34,860 --> 00:13:38,000
And if they told me from the start I would have prepared

246
00:13:37,240 --> 00:13:39,680
Yeah exactly, something to pass the time

247
00:13:39,680 --> 00:13:41,740
Japanese first class is amazing isn't it?

248
00:13:41,740 --> 00:13:43,890
They have pajamas and everything

249
00:13:44,350 --> 00:13:50,060
I've never been in first!

250
00:13:46,990 --> 00:13:50,060
I've never been in first either

251
00:13:50,060 --> 00:13:52,160
How did you go to New York?

252
00:13:52,160 --> 00:13:54,230
That was in Business

253
00:13:52,840 --> 00:13:54,230
That's a lie for sure

254
00:13:54,230 --> 00:13:57,680
It was definitley first

255
00:13:58,200 --> 00:14:00,020
It wasn't economy right?

256
00:13:58,200 --> 00:14:00,870
No way, he's beyond that level

257
00:14:00,220 --> 00:14:04,210
He probably sleeps on the pilot's shoulder

258
00:14:07,760 --> 00:14:10,640
That's more tiring, sleeping like that

259
00:14:11,110 --> 00:14:12,760
I wanna lay down!

260
00:14:11,470 --> 00:14:15,220
He rides in a never before seen class

261
00:14:15,220 --> 00:14:17,220
I think Japanese airlines are amazing

262
00:14:23,900 --> 00:14:28,340
If you go in first, they ask you,
"Would you like to change into Pajamas?"

263
00:14:28,340 --> 00:14:30,200
I didn't know about that

264
00:14:30,200 --> 00:14:33,200
Do you really not know about that?

265
00:14:33,540 --> 00:14:38,000
That's a thing. And then the Attendant changes the washroom,

266
00:14:38,000 --> 00:14:41,000
How do I put it, they turn it into a changing room

267
00:14:43,700 --> 00:14:47,760
Oh, to change into pajamas?

268
00:14:44,580 --> 00:14:47,760
Yes, so you change in there. And...

269
00:14:47,760 --> 00:14:52,340
They put out a boy- actually that's not it

270
00:14:52,340 --> 00:14:54,340
A boy? Oh a bed?

271
00:14:52,900 --> 00:14:57,740
Yeah they prepare some bedding, when it's time to sleep

272
00:14:58,300 --> 00:15:02,330
And it's amazing, it's totally flat with clean sheets

273
00:15:04,330 --> 00:15:05,900
First is amazing!

274
00:15:05,900 --> 00:15:08,000
First is amazing

275
00:15:09,500 --> 00:15:11,660
I've never been in there

276
00:15:10,160 --> 00:15:11,660
I've never been in there

277
00:15:11,660 --> 00:15:15,710
I seriously thought "I might just  **** ***"

278
00:15:11,660 --> 00:15:15,710
TN: I think he's saying jerk off

279
00:15:16,300 --> 00:15:17,800
That's not allowed is it

280
00:15:17,800 --> 00:15:19,800
That's a grey area

281
00:15:21,000 --> 00:15:23,850
It depends on how you do it

282
00:15:24,040 --> 00:15:26,250
I haven't gone that far yet

283
00:15:26,250 --> 00:15:28,820
But usually Hamada-san, you use first right?

284
00:15:29,460 --> 00:15:31,000
No no no. I use Business

285
00:15:31,000 --> 00:15:33,490
Yeah but for your own trips you use first for sure

286
00:15:33,620 --> 00:15:35,490
No that's not true. I use business

287
00:15:35,490 --> 00:15:37,940
What kind of vibe are you trying to put off?

288
00:15:38,220 --> 00:15:40,800
There's a big gap between first and business

289
00:15:40,800 --> 00:15:42,540
Yeah the price is a lot lower

290
00:15:42,540 --> 00:15:44,870
It's this big a gap

291
00:15:44,870 --> 00:15:52,000
How much do you think it costs to go to New York from Japan in First?

292
00:15:52,000 --> 00:15:53,900
I was shocked when I heard,

293
00:15:53,900 --> 00:15:55,800
It's over 3,000,000 yen ($22K USD)

294
00:15:59,040 --> 00:16:00,900
That's a car

295
00:15:59,040 --> 00:16:00,900
Wow

296
00:16:00,900 --> 00:16:05,580
It's like driving there, coming back, and leaving your car at the airport

297
00:16:06,760 --> 00:16:08,380
And that's all

298
00:16:08,380 --> 00:16:11,660
Hold on, only 3 of us are shocked

299
00:16:13,660 --> 00:16:15,700
One of us knew already

300
00:16:14,660 --> 00:16:17,840
I was surprised too

301
00:16:15,700 --> 00:16:17,840
Hold on, now that I think about it,

302
00:16:17,840 --> 00:16:21,830
You own a private jet don't you?

303
00:16:21,830 --> 00:16:24,920
Idiot!

304
00:16:22,920 --> 00:16:24,920
On the H mark

305
00:16:24,920 --> 00:16:27,310
I don't travel that often!

306
00:16:27,720 --> 00:16:32,800
One that can land on the H mark

307
00:16:36,400 --> 00:16:40,040
We just talked about Matsumoto-san's movie,

308
00:16:40,040 --> 00:16:42,280
There's more about it

309
00:16:42,360 --> 00:16:50,080
The other day Matsumoto-san surprised us by promoting his new film R-100 on a Hokkaido TV station

310
00:16:50,080 --> 00:16:55,140
Why did he choose to go on a local broadcast? How was the promotion?

311
00:16:55,580 --> 00:16:56,740
There's a video

312
00:16:56,740 --> 00:17:00,910
There's a video of it

313
00:16:59,760 --> 00:17:01,440
Enough already!

314
00:17:01,440 --> 00:17:06,300
Matsumoto appeared on Hokkaido new program Ichioshi

315
00:17:06,760 --> 00:17:10,120
Hello. We have something special for you all

316
00:17:10,120 --> 00:17:13,530
And that is a special guest

317
00:17:13,530 --> 00:17:15,940
A movie director

318
00:17:15,940 --> 00:17:19,400
Today Matsumoto Hitoshi-san will be joining us

319
00:17:19,400 --> 00:17:22,480
Welcome director!

320
00:17:24,000 --> 00:17:29,230
Everyone in the studio seems to be smirking at me

321
00:17:32,730 --> 00:17:34,420
This is amazing!

322
00:17:36,490 --> 00:17:41,040
This is what I hate, watching this here with you guys

323
00:17:41,040 --> 00:17:42,780
And it's almost released right?

324
00:17:42,780 --> 00:17:46,230
I'm not sure what kind of facial expression I should have

325
00:17:47,060 --> 00:17:50,920
Ah there's a red lamp on that camera there

326
00:17:50,920 --> 00:17:52,920
And I forgot that

327
00:17:52,920 --> 00:17:59,240
He's laughing so much

328
00:17:59,240 --> 00:18:00,880
ENOUGH ALREADY

329
00:18:00,880 --> 00:18:05,960
He's going HAHAHAA

330
00:18:05,960 --> 00:18:07,500
C'mon it's a commerical now

331
00:18:08,640 --> 00:18:12,500
And then, Matsumoto was asked to convey his feelings towards the movie in one word

332
00:18:12,500 --> 00:18:13,500
Go ahead.

333
00:18:14,240 --> 00:18:16,550
Ichioshi! (Highly reccomend it!)

334
00:18:16,550 --> 00:18:19,640
I get it! You're promoting it

335
00:18:21,560 --> 00:18:23,430
There's a lot of applause

336
00:18:23,430 --> 00:18:29,080
Please watch the movie when it comes out. Thank you very much!

337
00:18:35,500 --> 00:18:38,180
Amazing!

338
00:18:38,380 --> 00:18:40,180
It was a local broadcast only

339
00:18:40,180 --> 00:18:44,960
I did a lot of promotion for the film so far,

340
00:18:45,380 --> 00:18:49,680
There aren't many national programs left to do it on

341
00:18:49,680 --> 00:18:52,820
Yeah you've been on all of them

342
00:18:50,700 --> 00:18:53,680
So I thought I want to do something different

343
00:18:53,880 --> 00:18:58,000
On a local broadcast that doesn't play here at all,

344
00:18:58,000 --> 00:19:00,060
I thought it would be new,

345
00:19:00,060 --> 00:19:02,400
I thought it would be interesting

346
00:19:02,400 --> 00:19:09,860
It was interesting, but it was a pain. I got so nervous.

347
00:19:08,510 --> 00:19:11,120
After all this time in the industry,

348
00:19:11,240 --> 00:19:14,140
There's always at least one face I recognise in the staff

349
00:19:14,140 --> 00:19:16,830
There's at least 1 to 2 people I would know

350
00:19:17,140 --> 00:19:19,950
It was ALL people I didn't know

351
00:19:20,180 --> 00:19:22,220
I've never experienced that before

352
00:19:22,220 --> 00:19:26,660
Even when I was a total rookie, I knew at least Hamada

353
00:19:26,660 --> 00:19:29,160
That's right, you were with him

354
00:19:29,160 --> 00:19:33,480
But even Hamada isn't there. It was literally just strangers.

355
00:19:35,620 --> 00:19:40,780
There were some, what do you call them, local celebrities,

356
00:19:40,780 --> 00:19:42,810
And you go like

357
00:19:44,120 --> 00:19:47,180
You go like "AAAAHH"

358
00:19:45,600 --> 00:19:47,180
They get a chance to meet you too

359
00:19:47,180 --> 00:19:50,700
"I don't know your character!"

360
00:19:53,860 --> 00:19:56,240
But they were laughing though

361
00:19:58,040 --> 00:20:00,250
You don't see it often this kind of thing

362
00:20:00,250 --> 00:20:02,330
But that's also interesting

363
00:20:01,800 --> 00:20:05,240
Is that right?

364
00:20:02,330 --> 00:20:06,070
But even though I went through the trouble of doing a local broadcast,

365
00:20:05,620 --> 00:20:08,880
Watching it here with everyone ruins the point!

366
00:20:09,370 --> 00:20:11,720
This is the most embarassing thing

367
00:20:30,060 --> 00:20:35,320
Even people who don't know about baseball know Tanaka Masahiro,

368
00:20:35,320 --> 00:20:36,600
And he's a very good player

369
00:20:37,060 --> 00:20:39,940
He has 21 wins from the opening of the season

370
00:20:39,940 --> 00:20:44,940
25 consecutive wins this year, it's the best record in the world

371
00:20:45,080 --> 00:20:47,940
Yeah #1 in the world right now

372
00:20:45,760 --> 00:20:47,940
#1 in the world?

373
00:20:47,940 --> 00:20:55,420
"Could you use a comedy industry analogy to explain how amazing this is?"
by pen name "Gyudon Taro-san"

374
00:20:55,420 --> 00:20:59,030
Gyudon Taro-san?
(Mr. Taro BeefBowl)

375
00:20:56,980 --> 00:20:59,030
Yes.

376
00:20:59,030 --> 00:21:01,060
There's no mistake, it says Gyudon Taro-san

377
00:21:01,260 --> 00:21:04,190
I wonder how old he is now

378
00:21:04,320 --> 00:21:06,160
I don't know the original name

379
00:21:06,160 --> 00:21:08,680
It says it's a pen name

380
00:21:08,680 --> 00:21:11,960
He hasn't lost since September 18th

381
00:21:12,260 --> 00:21:14,860
So 21 times this year,

382
00:21:14,860 --> 00:21:18,160
You played baseball so you understand,

383
00:21:18,700 --> 00:21:20,700
Basically if you pitch good you win

384
00:21:21,700 --> 00:21:24,750
I don't know baseball so I can't grasp how impressive this is

385
00:21:25,080 --> 00:21:29,420
(TN: Sorry (; _ ;) idk what he's saying here)

386
00:21:29,420 --> 00:21:32,560
(TN: Sorry (; _ ;) idk what he's saying here)

387
00:21:33,560 --> 00:21:38,120
And he hasn't lost once in the last 25 matches

388
00:21:38,580 --> 00:21:41,760
Which means he's responsible for 25 wins by himself

389
00:21:42,440 --> 00:21:43,760
I don't really get that

390
00:21:43,760 --> 00:21:45,500
I don't get it

391
00:21:45,500 --> 00:21:46,560
No way, really?

392
00:21:46,560 --> 00:21:49,060
If you use baseball terms I won't get it

393
00:21:49,060 --> 00:21:50,920
Use an analogy to explain

394
00:21:50,920 --> 00:21:54,670
I know baseball so I can only explain it in baseball terms

395
00:21:57,660 --> 00:22:00,090
These two just sighed so loud

396
00:22:00,440 --> 00:22:03,940
If I had to explain this in comedian terms...

397
00:22:03,940 --> 00:22:07,560
We're comedians but we don't really know baseball

398
00:22:07,560 --> 00:22:11,180
Endo-san is a comedian and he played baseball so,

399
00:22:11,180 --> 00:22:14,500
If Endo-san doesn't explain it  we won't understand it

400
00:22:15,460 --> 00:22:18,980
If I had to convey how impressive this is...

401
00:22:19,460 --> 00:22:20,980
He didn't lose means...

402
00:22:23,320 --> 00:22:25,920
If I use TV ratings as an example,

403
00:22:26,700 --> 00:22:35,620
It's like getting 25% viewership ratings every week for a year

404
00:22:26,700 --> 00:22:35,620
It's like getting 25% viewership ratings every week for a year

405
00:22:35,920 --> 00:22:37,800
That's how impressive it is

406
00:22:37,800 --> 00:22:40,730
That was hard to understand

407
00:22:41,190 --> 00:22:45,190
Gyoza, can you use Gyoza to explain it

408
00:22:41,190 --> 00:22:45,190
TN: Gyoza are dumplings

409
00:22:42,620 --> 00:22:45,190
It's not hard to get at all

410
00:22:45,190 --> 00:22:47,300
That was pretty easy to understand

411
00:22:47,480 --> 00:22:49,460
I like Gyoza

412
00:22:49,460 --> 00:22:52,820
I really love Gyoza. Can you explain it using Gyoza?

413
00:22:52,820 --> 00:22:57,140
"I don't give a shit about Gyoza so do it yourself" - is what I would say

414
00:22:59,920 --> 00:23:04,110
It's like a comedian never bombing. Basically.

415
00:23:04,360 --> 00:23:10,180
It's like in Oogiri and getting laughs with everything you say

416
00:23:10,180 --> 00:23:12,180
It's just that face.

417
00:23:10,180 --> 00:23:12,180
That face

418
00:23:18,340 --> 00:23:19,960
Amazing.

419
00:23:19,960 --> 00:23:24,360
Masahiro is from Hyogo prefecture right?

420
00:23:23,640 --> 00:23:25,940
From Itami

421
00:23:24,360 --> 00:23:25,940
Right, from Itami

422
00:23:26,040 --> 00:23:29,660
There's so many impressive people from Hyogo prefecture

423
00:23:30,200 --> 00:23:32,000
People from Hyogo prefecture?

424
00:23:30,620 --> 00:23:33,060
Yeah people from Hyogo prefecture

425
00:23:33,060 --> 00:23:34,720
They're doing well for themselves?

426
00:23:34,720 --> 00:23:37,720
Yes! It's impressive

427
00:23:37,720 --> 00:23:39,720
Aibu Saki-CHAN

428
00:23:40,180 --> 00:23:42,180
Ueno Juri-CHAN

429
00:23:43,060 --> 00:23:45,060
Hyogey's Kitagawa Keiko-CHAN

430
00:23:46,100 --> 00:23:49,640
Todo Erika-CHAN

431
00:23:47,340 --> 00:23:49,640
They're all women

432
00:23:51,640 --> 00:23:56,180
And this grown ass man going "CHAN CHAN CHAN CHAN"

433
00:23:56,480 --> 00:23:59,120
Counting on his fingers going CHAN CHAN CHAN CHAN

434
00:23:59,360 --> 00:24:03,620
And Nena-Chan!

435
00:24:00,620 --> 00:24:03,620
They're all women!
