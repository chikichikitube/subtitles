1
00:00:21,270 --> 00:00:25,340
Finally, the judgment on Ochoko-Matsumoto will come tonight.

2
00:00:37,620 --> 00:00:40,850
Earlier, I introduced him to a gastropub owned by my friend.

3
00:00:40,850 --> 00:00:45,190
This pub has very good food.

4
00:00:45,190 --> 00:00:53,030
About six of us went there.
We drank, ate, and had a great time.
Much time had passed and it was time to pay the bill.

5
00:00:53,030 --> 00:00:56,900
At that time, Matsumoto-san treated us.
I thanked him.

6
00:00:56,970 --> 00:00:58,970
After we left the pub, he said to me,

7
00:00:59,240 --> 00:01:01,810
"I don't want to tell you because it's your acquaintance's restaurant..."

8
00:01:01,940 --> 00:01:06,480
It was only 20,000 yen for six people.
It was only 20,000 yen, really good price!

9
00:01:06,680 --> 00:01:10,450
But he said,
"I don't want to say this because it's an acquaintance's restaurant, but that place is a rip-off."

10
00:01:15,820 --> 00:01:17,190
It's cheap, isn't it!?

11
00:01:17,420 --> 00:01:19,960
He kept saying how delicious the food was!

12
00:01:20,260 --> 00:01:22,130
The six of us had a great time.

13
00:01:22,130 --> 00:01:23,400
Only 20,000 yen for 6 people!?

14
00:01:23,400 --> 00:01:26,300
Only 20,000 yen!
It was REALLY REALLY REALLY good price!!

15
00:01:26,700 --> 00:01:29,370
But he said!!,
"That place is a rip-off."

16
00:01:31,140 --> 00:01:35,510
What the hell!
I don't need you guys to tell me that!!

17
00:01:36,010 --> 00:01:39,680
Do you know how many times I've treated you guys?

18
00:01:40,110 --> 00:01:44,080
We want you to show us how cool you are.
You're our leader.

19
00:01:44,620 --> 00:01:47,020
"Our"!?
You have nothing to do with us!!

20
00:01:50,360 --> 00:01:54,330
- We belong to Yoshimoto, but you belong to Jinrikisha!!
- No! I'm in Yoshimoto too!!

21
00:01:54,330 --> 00:01:55,930
- Is that so!?
- No!

22
00:01:56,800 --> 00:01:59,630
-  I'm in Yoshimoto too!
- You are not!

23
00:02:00,500 --> 00:02:02,700
What are you talking about?

24
00:02:04,640 --> 00:02:12,010
Pants sold at Uniqlo or Jeansmate are usually around 3,000 yen.

25
00:02:12,280 --> 00:02:22,590
He doesn't buy that easily in the fitting room, saying
"Ummm. I can't make up my mind!  I can't decide!!"

26
00:02:23,420 --> 00:02:24,660
He's terrible.

27
00:02:25,960 --> 00:02:28,660
He picked up a camouflage outfit and asked me,
"What do you think of this?"

28
00:02:28,660 --> 00:02:33,000
I don't like camouflage pattern, but he is my senior,
so I said, "Oh, this is good."

29
00:02:34,070 --> 00:02:38,170
He looked at the price tag and said,
"This is nice, I'll buy it."
It was 8,000 yen.

30
00:02:38,740 --> 00:02:41,010
"I can't afford this."

31
00:02:43,810 --> 00:02:45,080
I was surprised!

32
00:02:45,710 --> 00:02:47,880
He could buy the whole store if he wanted to!

33
00:02:48,950 --> 00:02:51,720
That's enough!
That's not true!

34
00:02:51,720 --> 00:02:55,490
- That's true!
- No, that's not!

35
00:02:55,490 --> 00:02:58,060
Fuck you all!!

36
00:03:00,430 --> 00:03:02,030
So, what the hell are you!?

37
00:03:03,430 --> 00:03:04,500
I'm standing on the witn...

38
00:03:04,500 --> 00:03:07,200
You have a big nose and small nostrils!!

39
00:03:07,200 --> 00:03:10,940
That has nothing to do with it!

40
00:03:11,340 --> 00:03:14,510
- You should be in The Best 100 Noses in Japan!
- What the hell is that!?

41
00:03:14,510 --> 00:03:16,310
There is no such thing.

42
00:03:16,310 --> 00:03:20,950
He will definitely be chosen for The Best 100 Noses in Japan.

43
00:03:23,750 --> 00:03:26,320
So, what's next, Endo?

44
00:03:26,450 --> 00:03:30,790
Not from me.
The witnesses are here, may I allow them to enter the court?

45
00:03:30,790 --> 00:03:32,960
- Witnesses, please enter the court.
- Please come in.

46
00:03:37,430 --> 00:03:38,400
Please come here.

47
00:03:44,040 --> 00:03:51,680
For those of you who don't know them, let me introduce them.
He's Matsumoto-san's manager, Fujiwara-san.
And he is Hamada-san's manager, Kimoto-san.

48
00:03:51,980 --> 00:03:55,550
So, how long have you been his manager?

49
00:03:56,250 --> 00:03:58,720
More than three and a half years.

50
00:03:58,720 --> 00:04:00,750
- Three and a half years.
- Oh, really?

51
00:04:00,750 --> 00:04:04,290
- Most of the time, the manager is with the comedian.
- Right.

52
00:04:04,290 --> 00:04:07,260
He had been with the defendant for three and a half years.

53
00:04:07,660 --> 00:04:14,170
Have you had any treats from him in those three and a half years?

54
00:04:20,040 --> 00:04:21,310
Okay, thank you.

55
00:04:21,310 --> 00:04:24,410
Don't lie!
He's lying!

56
00:04:24,410 --> 00:04:25,280
What's wrong?

57
00:04:25,280 --> 00:04:29,050
I bought him a cup of coffee at the L.A. airport!

58
00:04:35,990 --> 00:04:37,560
What's so funny!?

59
00:04:38,460 --> 00:04:40,060
What's so funny!!?

60
00:04:41,030 --> 00:04:46,530
The fact that Fujiwara-san has not said anything suggests that he has never been treated by the defendant otherwise.

61
00:04:47,470 --> 00:04:50,170
Next, Kimoto-san.
How long have you been Hamada-san's manager?

62
00:04:50,870 --> 00:04:53,570
- About three years and four months.
- About the same as him?
- Yes.

63
00:04:53,710 --> 00:04:55,710
Have you ever had a treat from him?

64
00:04:55,710 --> 00:05:06,620
He often says to me after work, "I'm tired.
Let's eat yakiniku together."

65
00:05:09,120 --> 00:05:10,720
Yakiniku!

66
00:05:11,490 --> 00:05:12,460
Choice cut.

67
00:05:12,460 --> 00:05:16,060
The meat at the yakiniku restaurant he takes him to is not beef.

68
00:05:16,930 --> 00:05:18,930
- That's beef, right?
- Of course!

69
00:05:18,930 --> 00:05:22,970
- Hamada-san, is that beef?
- Definitely not.

70
00:05:23,170 --> 00:05:27,170
- And what kind of beef did you have?
- Choice cut beef.

71
00:05:29,340 --> 00:05:32,080
- That was DEFINITELY a choice cut beef.
- DEFINITELY!

72
00:05:34,010 --> 00:05:36,950
- Of course he has bought you a cup of coffee, hasn't he?
- Many times.

73
00:05:37,220 --> 00:05:39,620
After all, he buys it with the money in my wallet.

74
00:05:41,590 --> 00:05:43,760
What does that mean?

75
00:05:43,760 --> 00:05:45,260
I'll explain later!

76
00:05:45,260 --> 00:05:46,090
Okay.

77
00:05:46,360 --> 00:05:48,760
Well, let's ask him about that later.

78
00:05:49,230 --> 00:05:51,230
Did he give you anything for your birthday?

79
00:05:51,800 --> 00:05:55,500
- It was my birthday last month.
- Happy birthday.

80
00:05:55,500 --> 00:06:03,240
When I was alone with him in the dressing room, he took 50,000 yen out of his pocket and gave it to me.

81
00:06:05,610 --> 00:06:07,350
Wow! Cool!!

82
00:06:11,320 --> 00:06:12,320
So cool!

83
00:06:13,050 --> 00:06:14,920
Wait, wait, wait!

84
00:06:14,920 --> 00:06:16,820
This is not something to be applauded!

85
00:06:16,820 --> 00:06:19,090
I was just doing the obvious!

86
00:06:21,460 --> 00:06:22,960
Some people can't do that.

87
00:06:22,960 --> 00:06:24,700
Wait, wait, wait, wait!

88
00:06:25,230 --> 00:06:27,900
Is this a episode to praise Hamada rather than condemn me?

89
00:06:28,100 --> 00:06:31,770
No, it's not.
Why did you give him 50,000 yen?

90
00:06:31,770 --> 00:06:35,010
I didn't know what he wanted, so I figured he could buy whatever he wanted with it.

91
00:06:36,240 --> 00:06:37,310
He is awesome.

92
00:06:37,310 --> 00:06:38,780
He is cool.

93
00:06:39,080 --> 00:06:41,350
Fujiwara, talk about that!

94
00:06:45,720 --> 00:06:47,490
Talk about that quickly!

95
00:06:47,490 --> 00:06:51,790
Did that really happen?
If so, please talk about it for Matsumoto-san's sake.

96
00:06:53,460 --> 00:07:05,840
It's not my birthday, but every year on his birthday, he receives a big cake and a big bouquet of flowers from Gaki's staff.

97
00:07:05,840 --> 00:07:09,010
- We all ate the cake together.
- Yes.

98
00:07:09,010 --> 00:07:17,780
I tried to give the bouquet to Matsumoto-san on his way home.
Then he said, "I don't want those, you give them to your wife," so I took them and left.

99
00:07:18,250 --> 00:07:21,120
That's not a present from him to you!

100
00:07:23,620 --> 00:07:25,360
Fujiwara, not that!!

101
00:07:28,130 --> 00:07:30,260
Talk about what happened the other day!

102
00:07:30,360 --> 00:07:31,400
Did that really happen?

103
00:07:31,400 --> 00:07:32,330
Talk about that.

104
00:07:32,600 --> 00:07:33,630
If so, tell us about that.

105
00:07:34,170 --> 00:07:35,600
Talk about that.

106
00:07:35,600 --> 00:07:37,940
Talk about that,
or rather, make something up.

107
00:07:39,540 --> 00:07:40,610
That's a fabrication!

108
00:07:41,710 --> 00:07:43,010
Make something up.

109
00:07:44,440 --> 00:07:45,780
“Make” ?

110
00:07:46,710 --> 00:07:47,980
He doesn't have that kind of skill.

111
00:07:50,050 --> 00:07:57,090
But Fujiwara-san gave Matsumoto-san a birthday present.

112
00:07:57,220 --> 00:08:00,160
Oh, really?
Did you give him something?

113
00:08:00,890 --> 00:08:02,230
Oh, he gave me something.

114
00:08:02,660 --> 00:08:06,700
Yes, I gave him a necktie pin.

115
00:08:06,700 --> 00:08:12,670
Even though he gave Matsumoto-san a necktie pin, he did not receive anything from Matsumoto-san.

116
00:08:13,140 --> 00:08:15,010
I think that's a problem.

117
00:08:15,010 --> 00:08:17,810
Frankly speaking, I don't need a necktie pin.

118
00:08:22,450 --> 00:08:24,450
Shut up!!
You guys get the hell out of here!!

119
00:08:25,350 --> 00:08:27,190
We're closed!
Go home!

120
00:08:28,790 --> 00:08:30,190
Don't come forward!

121
00:08:30,860 --> 00:08:33,760
Don't touch me, you're disgusting!

122
00:08:34,630 --> 00:08:35,330
Go away!

123
00:08:36,030 --> 00:08:38,100
- Go away!
- Sit down!

124
00:08:41,370 --> 00:08:45,840
Hey, what the hell is that?

125
00:08:46,240 --> 00:08:48,910
What the hell is that?

126
00:08:50,240 --> 00:08:54,050
- What the hell is that?
- He tickles him.
- They are classmates.

127
00:09:01,020 --> 00:09:04,790
- Trip to Ise Case -

128
00:09:06,490 --> 00:09:15,470
This is a case from a few years ago when Matsumoto, Kimura, Imada, and Itao went to Ise for a visit.

129
00:09:16,070 --> 00:09:18,940
When we got to Ise, let's eat a lot of good food.

130
00:09:19,540 --> 00:09:22,710
Yeah!
Ise lobsters are very tasty.

131
00:09:23,040 --> 00:09:27,410
The four had a great time in the car and they arrived at Ise.

132
00:09:29,050 --> 00:09:32,750
Yeah! Parque España!!

133
00:09:33,050 --> 00:09:35,520
The four of them enjoyed the sights.

134
00:09:35,590 --> 00:09:37,120
Then Matsumoto said.

135
00:09:38,290 --> 00:09:42,160
As I recall, there was a Nichii earlier, wasn't there?
Can we stop by there before eating?

136
00:09:42,760 --> 00:09:44,300
Okay.

137
00:09:44,930 --> 00:09:52,840
He couldn't help but stop by there, as Nichii was very interesting to Matsumoto, who was interested in cheap stores.

138
00:09:55,710 --> 00:10:01,210
Wow, This is a nice T-shirt!
It's so cheap! I have to buy it!

139
00:10:02,050 --> 00:10:05,350
Matsumoto was very excited.

140
00:10:05,620 --> 00:10:07,920
And then his shopping was over.

141
00:10:08,590 --> 00:10:11,860
I'm hungry.  Let's eat something.

142
00:10:12,660 --> 00:10:15,630
That's nice!

143
00:10:16,330 --> 00:10:21,370
Finally, I can eat lobster.
How dare you waste my time.

144
00:10:22,070 --> 00:10:23,100
But...

145
00:10:23,470 --> 00:10:26,170
Don't these places have restaurants in the basement?

146
00:10:28,540 --> 00:10:29,610
No way!

147
00:10:30,310 --> 00:10:35,950
Contrary to what the three of us thought, Matsumoto headed for an udon restaurant in the basement.

148
00:10:37,480 --> 00:10:40,120
When Matsumoto saw the food they ordered, he said,

149
00:10:41,220 --> 00:10:43,590
This isn't enough for me.

150
00:10:44,020 --> 00:10:46,390
They sold croquettes over there.

151
00:10:46,560 --> 00:10:49,860
Kimu, can you go get me some of that?

152
00:10:50,130 --> 00:10:53,600
But isn't it bad to bring them in here?

153
00:10:53,900 --> 00:10:57,900
Why don't you ask the waiterabout that, asshole?
Oh well, I'll ask her.

154
00:10:58,570 --> 00:11:01,170
Excuse me, can I bring something in?

155
00:11:02,210 --> 00:11:10,620
Normally, you are not allowed to bring in anything, but the clerk reluctantly agreed to Matsumoto's request.

156
00:11:11,550 --> 00:11:17,390
He then added croquettes, which Kimura had bought, to the side dish.

157
00:11:18,560 --> 00:11:23,130
It would be gorgeous with this!
The size has increased, hasn't it?

158
00:11:23,930 --> 00:11:28,270
The three were stunned by Matsumoto's delight at the udon set meal.

159
00:11:28,970 --> 00:11:35,040
In the end, they had to come all the way to Ise to eat udon.

160
00:11:35,410 --> 00:11:38,280
I see.

161
00:11:38,910 --> 00:11:40,980
Judge, may I call a witness?

162
00:11:41,480 --> 00:11:43,550
Witness, please enter the court.

163
00:11:47,590 --> 00:11:49,190
He doesn't look like a comedian!

164
00:11:55,930 --> 00:11:59,400
He's looking sharp.

165
00:12:00,330 --> 00:12:03,470
Is it true what happened at the VCR?

166
00:12:03,470 --> 00:12:09,310
Yes, I thought I wouldn't tell this story until I die if I didn't have this opportunity.

167
00:12:09,840 --> 00:12:12,010
- I see.
- This is a good opportunity.

168
00:12:13,410 --> 00:12:21,690
One thing is bothering me.
You guys were planning to eat lobsters and other seafood, but ended up eating udon noodles, was that lunch?

169
00:12:22,590 --> 00:12:23,590
That was not lunch.

170
00:12:24,190 --> 00:12:25,160
That was dinner.

171
00:12:25,860 --> 00:12:27,060
Wasn't that lunch!?

172
00:12:27,060 --> 00:12:33,330
No. If it was lunch, I would have udon and enjoy dinner.

173
00:12:34,230 --> 00:12:35,800
- Was that dinner!?
- Yes!

174
00:12:36,700 --> 00:12:39,440
That was UNTHINKABLE.

175
00:12:42,310 --> 00:12:50,050
I was going to wait in the car while he was shopping at Nichii.

176
00:12:50,250 --> 00:12:53,850
I see.
When he's done shopping, you guys can go to the restaurant right away.

177
00:12:53,850 --> 00:12:58,790
But he wanted to see the grocery section in the basement.

178
00:13:00,060 --> 00:13:05,530
That's where he found Tacchan Croquettes.
For some reason, he took an unusual interest in them.

179
00:13:07,200 --> 00:13:11,540
Why? He had eaten them before, right?

180
00:13:12,240 --> 00:13:15,410
The Ise one might taste different, right?!

181
00:13:15,410 --> 00:13:22,480
He was so interested in it that I thought Umemiya-san might have his weakness.
"Oh, they sell them in these places too!"

182
00:13:22,480 --> 00:13:25,250
Well, I can see why he was interested in it.

183
00:13:25,250 --> 00:13:38,160
I've got a bit of a confession, but I figured if he ate a couple of them, his stomach would growl a little, and we could have lobster or abalone an hour or so later.

184
00:13:38,600 --> 00:13:40,300
That was a mom's idea.

185
00:13:41,770 --> 00:13:46,040
That's right! I think it's stingy to think like that!

186
00:13:46,640 --> 00:13:50,640
That's what I think is a stingy...

187
00:13:50,640 --> 00:13:52,010
Hey, why are you
looking at me?

188
00:13:53,580 --> 00:13:54,950
Snap out of it!!

189
00:13:56,550 --> 00:14:02,890
You came to Ise for a luxurious meal, and you're fine with udon?

190
00:14:02,890 --> 00:14:04,960
He usually eats luxurious meals.

191
00:14:05,560 --> 00:14:06,290
Is that so?

192
00:14:06,290 --> 00:14:06,960
Nope.

193
00:14:08,230 --> 00:14:08,930
"Nope"?

194
00:14:12,500 --> 00:14:16,400
I also don't understand why he was so incredibly excited at Parque España.

195
00:14:19,170 --> 00:14:21,340
How was he excited?

196
00:14:23,140 --> 00:14:30,250
Four of us got on a boat and went on an attraction where we drifted down a river.

197
00:14:30,680 --> 00:14:39,860
At the end, the river splits in two and It goes down about 3 meters and goes outside.

198
00:14:40,290 --> 00:14:41,960
I thought "hmmm", but he was different.

199
00:14:46,030 --> 00:14:47,200
What the hell.

200
00:14:52,970 --> 00:14:54,540
He's a funny guy.

201
00:14:55,210 --> 00:14:57,580
He comes up with more funny stuff, though.

202
00:15:00,850 --> 00:15:02,580
I thought so.

203
00:15:03,550 --> 00:15:11,990
- What the hell.
- I have something I want to apologize to Yamazaki, Cocorico, and Ameagari for.

204
00:15:12,590 --> 00:15:13,860
Why?

205
00:15:13,960 --> 00:15:18,830
You guys interacted with him later than I did.

206
00:15:18,900 --> 00:15:22,370
I'm sorry I didn't stop his stinginess when I met him.

207
00:15:25,040 --> 00:15:29,210
- It's okay!
- Please don't apologize!

208
00:15:32,210 --> 00:15:35,480
Hey!!
I'll tell you one thing!!

209
00:15:36,180 --> 00:15:39,150
It's no fun being
with you guys!!

210
00:15:40,620 --> 00:15:42,820
It's no fun playing
with you guys!!

211
00:15:43,420 --> 00:15:44,260
Go home!

212
00:15:44,260 --> 00:15:47,760
Then why did you say
"When I trip, all I need is for Kimu to be there" to me?

213
00:15:49,360 --> 00:15:51,600
I was just being polite.

214
00:15:53,300 --> 00:15:56,670
Get out!!
You're all a bunch of pussies!!

215
00:15:57,640 --> 00:16:03,710
There is so much more I want to say, but I can't seem to say it in words, so I wrote him a letter.

216
00:16:04,840 --> 00:16:06,210
Then, please read it.

217
00:16:08,550 --> 00:16:13,450
When you went to Russia the other day, I got a 40 yen pin badge as a souvenir from you for the first time.
Thank you.

218
00:16:17,090 --> 00:16:18,090
So cheap!

219
00:16:19,090 --> 00:16:24,130
Prices are low in Russia!
Even if that is 40 yen in Japan, it might be worth 40,000 yen in Russia!

220
00:16:25,300 --> 00:16:27,900
This is true!
"You're full of it"?
Who the hell are you?

221
00:16:27,900 --> 00:16:29,870
Put your hood up!!

222
00:16:31,170 --> 00:16:32,840
Don't see anything for a while.

223
00:16:34,570 --> 00:16:35,910
Now, Kimura-kun, read it.

224
00:16:36,340 --> 00:16:38,380
Do you knou it?

225
00:16:38,980 --> 00:16:40,080
by Yuichi Kimura

226
00:16:43,280 --> 00:16:46,050
- Was that the title?
- Do you know it?

227
00:16:48,390 --> 00:16:54,330
I always carry 9 yen with me for you, because you hate saving coins.

228
00:16:55,560 --> 00:16:57,860
Do you know it?

229
00:16:59,100 --> 00:17:04,640
Even though the video you rented was quite overdue, I paid the late fee and return the video on your behalf.

230
00:17:06,140 --> 00:17:07,470
Do you know it?

231
00:17:08,140 --> 00:17:13,080
At last year's year-end party, you gave me 10,000 yen short of the amount I wanted you to pay.

232
00:17:15,250 --> 00:17:16,580
Do you know it?

233
00:17:17,180 --> 00:17:24,560
At a karaoke party with about 10 people, you said, "I'll leave first, I'll give you this much," and the money you gave me was only enough for three people.

234
00:17:26,190 --> 00:17:28,230
Do you know it?

235
00:17:28,960 --> 00:17:37,370
People say that high income earners who frequent Don Quijote and 100-yen stores are stingy.

236
00:17:44,680 --> 00:17:46,510
How unpleasant!

237
00:17:47,310 --> 00:17:48,750
How unpleasant!

238
00:17:50,680 --> 00:17:54,420
After this, testimonies from his friends revealed an unbelievable fact about Matsumoto.

239
00:17:54,650 --> 00:17:58,020
The trial then reaches its climax.

240
00:18:01,260 --> 00:18:04,230
Judge, may I play the next VCR?

241
00:18:04,930 --> 00:18:09,770
Here is a special testimonial VCR that was received from his associates.

242
00:18:11,070 --> 00:18:21,880
This is 130R's Itao-san's wedding celebration case.

243
00:18:22,380 --> 00:18:34,830
I wanted to celebrate Itao-san's wedding in a big way, so I decided to make the congratulatory gift 100,000 yen.

244
00:18:35,260 --> 00:18:40,500
I put 100,000 yen in an envelope and arrived at the venue.
And I was curious about one thing

245
00:18:41,170 --> 00:18:44,900
Maybe Ochoko-Matsumoto did something stingy.

246
00:18:45,340 --> 00:18:51,240
I asked the staff how much Matsumoto-san gave him.

247
00:18:52,180 --> 00:18:57,450
I got the sad information that it was a 70,000 yen.

248
00:18:58,180 --> 00:19:08,090
I wanted to congratulate Itao-san, but I took 50,000 yen out of 100,000 yen and changed 50,000 yen to the congratulatory money.

249
00:19:08,860 --> 00:19:13,030
I think you should give him 200,000 or 300,000 yen.

250
00:19:13,930 --> 00:19:18,340
Show us a little more of what you pay for.

251
00:19:18,500 --> 00:19:20,140
Please!

252
00:19:20,840 --> 00:19:24,780
We played a team game in jerseys with him in Gottsu-e-kanji.

253
00:19:24,780 --> 00:19:29,950
He wanted the jersey he wore for the shoot.

254
00:19:29,950 --> 00:19:31,550
It's just a jersey!

255
00:19:32,150 --> 00:19:35,790
Since that time you were making a lot of money.

256
00:19:36,190 --> 00:19:42,330
But why did you take that jersey home?

257
00:19:42,960 --> 00:19:48,200
I honestly thought you were pathetic like that.

258
00:19:48,500 --> 00:19:52,540
Also, please treat me to something just once.

259
00:19:53,670 --> 00:19:58,880
He has taken care of me for 15 years.

260
00:19:59,880 --> 00:20:09,020
The first treat he gave me was 170 yen udon noodles from the basement of a department store.

261
00:20:12,190 --> 00:20:15,730
He must be wondering what I am talking about now.

262
00:20:16,760 --> 00:20:17,930
I think back.

263
00:20:20,530 --> 00:20:23,170
For fifteen years I have been.....

264
00:20:24,300 --> 00:20:26,070
For fifteen years...

265
00:20:27,040 --> 00:20:28,910
For fifteen years...

266
00:20:31,980 --> 00:20:37,480
I often go out with him by car.

267
00:20:38,080 --> 00:20:47,160
For some reason, Matsumoto-san always says, "Let's go in one car."

268
00:20:47,890 --> 00:21:01,370
It is because there are five of us and it is more fun to all ride together in one car than to split into two or three and trip separately.

269
00:21:01,770 --> 00:21:05,410
I agree with that.

270
00:21:05,880 --> 00:21:11,880
So we try to take one car whenever we go somewhere.

271
00:21:11,880 --> 00:21:14,350
But one day it occurred to me.

272
00:21:14,690 --> 00:21:22,760
Sometimes we go in Matsumoto-san's car, and sometimes we go in my car.

273
00:21:22,760 --> 00:21:25,030
I noticed something.

274
00:21:25,230 --> 00:21:26,630
"Huh?"

275
00:21:30,870 --> 00:21:35,210
"He uses my car only when we goes to far places."

276
00:21:36,710 --> 00:21:38,040
Don't lie!

277
00:21:38,380 --> 00:21:41,080
The gas money?
He cares about gas money?

278
00:21:41,080 --> 00:21:42,850
No one does that!!

279
00:21:42,850 --> 00:21:45,920
Maybe I'm just imagining things.

280
00:21:48,050 --> 00:21:49,890
No one does that!!

281
00:21:51,790 --> 00:21:59,300
That's it for the VCR testimonials.
What did you all think about this?

282
00:21:59,700 --> 00:22:03,070
The last one about gas money was an eye opener.

283
00:22:04,840 --> 00:22:07,540
I've been pissed off for a while now, why is Onuma there?

284
00:22:11,410 --> 00:22:12,680
This guy has nothing to do with it!

285
00:22:13,180 --> 00:22:15,980
And his suit is most autumnal!

286
00:22:18,820 --> 00:22:20,350
He's been watching you the whole time.

287
00:22:21,150 --> 00:22:22,290
He's been watching you the whole time!

288
00:22:23,420 --> 00:22:27,160
He is the instigator of this trial.
That can't be helped.

289
00:22:27,160 --> 00:22:29,530
Then, Judge, please give your verdict.

290
00:22:32,300 --> 00:22:34,800
I will now pronounce the verdict.

291
00:22:35,570 --> 00:22:37,870
I will now pronounce the verdict.

292
00:22:39,640 --> 00:22:49,680
It's an undeniable fact that the defendant, Matsumoto Hitoshi, has caused trouble for many people in spite of being so rich,

293
00:22:49,680 --> 00:22:52,650
And it far exceeded our eg...expectations.

294
00:22:56,720 --> 00:22:58,620
It can’t be helped.

295
00:22:58,620 --> 00:23:03,560
Therefore, we consider it indefensible and the sentence is guilty.

296
00:23:04,660 --> 00:23:12,270
We sentence him to the "Let's withdraw 1 million yen from his savings and splurge!"

297
00:23:17,410 --> 00:23:18,640
It doesn't make sense!

298
00:23:19,180 --> 00:23:20,480
It doesn't make sense, right!?

299
00:23:21,010 --> 00:23:22,080
It doesn't make any sense!!

300
00:23:22,350 --> 00:23:22,950
Why?

301
00:23:22,950 --> 00:23:24,250
Are you guys okay with this?

302
00:23:24,550 --> 00:23:26,150
Is this a Japanese TV show!?

303
00:23:27,750 --> 00:23:29,990
Next time we'll do your "Too Stupid Trial".

304
00:23:30,390 --> 00:23:31,220
Hey!!!

305
00:23:31,220 --> 00:23:32,020
What?

306
00:23:33,460 --> 00:23:34,090
...Hey.

307
00:23:36,860 --> 00:23:37,930
What the hell?

308
00:23:38,630 --> 00:23:40,200
And next week,

309
00:23:40,700 --> 00:23:47,540
We will broadcast the execution of "Let's withdraw 1 million yen from stingy Matsumoto's savings and splurge!"

310
00:23:48,570 --> 00:23:54,210
Gaki no Tsukai's original video"Flame Talk: Legend of the 20th Century Part 2", now on sale!

311
00:23:54,850 --> 00:24:01,820
100 winners will be selected by drawing from among those who have purchased it, and will receive a picture book of
"The Best Selection of Stingy Onuma's Trial".
