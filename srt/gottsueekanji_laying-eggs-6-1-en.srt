00:00:00,060 --> 00:00:04,380
Laying Eggs

3
00:00:07,980 --> 00:00:09,420
It's fun, huh Yuuko-chan?

4
00:00:09,660 --> 00:00:11,100
Yes it is!

5
00:00:11,100 --> 00:00:11,740
Yeah

6
00:00:28,260 --> 00:00:30,180
Look Yuuko-chan, he's a famous steamed bun maker

7
00:00:30,700 --> 00:00:31,540
Yeah

8
00:00:31,940 --> 00:00:33,220
It's a steamed bun shop

9
00:00:33,500 --> 00:00:34,020
Yes

10
00:00:34,020 --> 00:00:36,060
Yuuko-chan look at the steamed buns

11
00:00:36,900 --> 00:00:38,500
Soft and white

12
00:00:39,140 --> 00:00:40,020
Warm

13
00:00:40,700 --> 00:00:42,020
Just like us

14
00:00:42,020 --> 00:00:43,620
Stop Koji-san!

15
00:00:44,180 --> 00:00:44,980
Shall we touch it?

16
00:00:46,260 --> 00:00:46,660
Yes

17
00:00:47,220 --> 00:00:48,300
Here we go

18
00:00:52,060 --> 00:00:52,900
I love you

19
00:00:53,020 --> 00:00:54,020
Koji-san!

20
00:00:54,620 --> 00:00:55,740
OK, right?

21
00:00:55,740 --> 00:00:56,980
Not here!

22
00:00:56,980 --> 00:00:57,820
It's fine

23
00:00:57,980 --> 00:00:59,340
They know we are in love

24
00:01:00,180 --> 00:01:01,140
Hey! Hey you!

25
00:01:01,780 --> 00:01:02,380
What?

26
00:01:04,380 --> 00:01:04,980
It's you

27
00:01:05,740 --> 00:01:06,940
Fish man!

28
00:01:08,340 --> 00:01:09,220
He's alive!

29
00:01:12,260 --> 00:01:13,860
Hey! You didn't die?

30
00:01:15,420 --> 00:01:16,460
Let me give birth

31
00:01:18,700 --> 00:01:19,940
You're still saying that?

32
00:01:21,100 --> 00:01:22,380
Give me child support payments

33
00:01:22,700 --> 00:01:23,180
What?

34
00:01:24,700 --> 00:01:25,500
Give you?

35
00:01:26,260 --> 00:01:27,500
What the hell are you saying?

36
00:01:27,740 --> 00:01:33,300
You know what, I'm here with Yuuko-chan
in Macau to have fun, don't bother us!

37
00:01:31,140 --> 00:01:31,980
That's right!

38
00:01:32,860 --> 00:01:34,300
That's right, just leave!

39
00:01:34,300 --> 00:01:38,740
You said that you are here in Macau today to have
fun with Yuuko-chan and not to bother you

40
00:01:39,340 --> 00:01:39,980
Huh?

41
00:01:41,820 --> 00:01:43,580
It wont be a fun trip!

42
00:01:44,420 --> 00:01:46,740
I said this trip is not going to be fun

43
00:01:48,220 --> 00:01:49,660
Hey! You're teasing me!

44
00:01:49,820 --> 00:01:50,580
What?

45
00:01:51,020 --> 00:01:51,820
I...

46
00:01:52,140 --> 00:01:53,020
Sign here

47
00:01:54,620 --> 00:01:55,820
Why should I sign anything?

48
00:01:56,980 --> 00:01:57,700
Pull this

49
00:01:59,140 --> 00:01:59,820
What is that?

50
00:01:59,980 --> 00:02:01,300
Pull it out!

51
00:02:01,820 --> 00:02:02,620
Pull it out?

52
00:02:18,860 --> 00:02:22,380
Out of all of these children, I'm going to raise just one

53
00:02:24,500 --> 00:02:26,300
Why are you thinking so negative

54
00:02:28,340 --> 00:02:30,580
Stupid! It has nothing to do with me

55
00:02:30,860 --> 00:02:31,580
These

56
00:02:31,580 --> 00:02:33,260
Hey! Stop!

57
00:02:34,140 --> 00:02:36,980
You know what, you're bothering us!

58
00:02:36,220 --> 00:02:36,980
That's right!

59
00:02:37,140 --> 00:02:39,140
Listen to these children's message!

60
00:02:40,340 --> 00:02:43,420
Close your eyes and listen to these children's message!

61
00:02:43,540 --> 00:02:46,140
Ok, I'll listen..just close my eyes, right?

62
00:02:46,740 --> 00:02:48,140
Hi! I'm Goku!

63
00:02:48,140 --> 00:02:49,020
What are you saying?

64
00:02:50,740 --> 00:02:52,340
You're a Fish man! Fish man!

65
00:02:53,860 --> 00:02:54,860
Not Goku!

66
00:02:56,460 --> 00:02:57,700
You are really...

67
00:02:57,860 --> 00:02:58,980
You should just die

68
00:03:00,500 --> 00:03:01,980
Right?
- Yes!

69
00:03:01,980 --> 00:03:04,060
Don't show me the cross!

70
00:03:07,140 --> 00:03:08,940
You fell for our trick

71
00:03:09,220 --> 00:03:09,620
Yuuko-chan

72
00:03:09,860 --> 00:03:13,140
Oh, where did I put it? I just had it earlier

73
00:03:14,500 --> 00:03:15,420
Hey Fish man!

74
00:03:16,580 --> 00:03:18,100
Take this!

75
00:03:22,100 --> 00:03:23,660
You lied, huh?

76
00:03:25,220 --> 00:03:25,620
Right?

77
00:03:26,860 --> 00:03:27,820
You lied, right?

78
00:03:29,100 --> 00:03:30,460
You said a cross.. but

79
00:03:31,260 --> 00:03:32,780
He's so annoying

80
00:03:33,340 --> 00:03:34,500
Why are you playing tricks!

81
00:03:34,740 --> 00:03:37,220
Don't show me a flashing light!

82
00:03:39,740 --> 00:03:41,900
He's definitely lying

83
00:03:41,900 --> 00:03:44,780
But, Koji-san, look at his guilty face

84
00:03:45,900 --> 00:03:47,300
It could be real this time

85
00:03:47,300 --> 00:03:47,780
Yes

86
00:03:47,780 --> 00:03:49,380
Act like we're going to take a picture

87
00:03:49,500 --> 00:03:50,140
Camera

88
00:03:50,140 --> 00:03:50,980
Flash

89
00:03:51,140 --> 00:03:51,860
This is it

90
00:03:51,980 --> 00:03:53,420
Thank goodness, Koji-san!

91
00:03:53,420 --> 00:03:53,900
This is good!

92
00:03:55,220 --> 00:03:56,420
Hey, Fish man!

93
00:03:59,260 --> 00:04:00,620
Take this

94
00:04:08,740 --> 00:04:09,540
Koji-san

95
00:04:09,700 --> 00:04:10,460
Let's go

96
00:04:10,460 --> 00:04:11,300
OK, let's go

97
00:04:12,260 --> 00:04:13,300
Give me a copy of the photos!
