00:00:00,580 --> 00:00:05,820
Gaki no Tsukai ya Arahende presents Episode 1 of Duo Fight: Bus Tour Full of Pink Ladies!!

2
00:00:07,320 --> 00:00:11,590
Downtown

3
00:00:07,320 --> 00:00:11,590
Hamada Masatoshi

4
00:00:07,320 --> 00:00:11,590
Matsumoto Hitoshi

5
00:00:08,790 --> 00:00:10,360
So, Matsumoto.

6
00:00:09,490 --> 00:00:11,490
Yes yes yes.

7
00:00:10,360 --> 00:00:11,890
We’ve done this 3 times in the past.

8
00:00:11,890 --> 00:00:14,260
Kogal, S&M queen, anime character

9
00:00:13,590 --> 00:00:15,330
That is indeed correct.

10
00:00:14,260 --> 00:00:16,130
Those are the cosplays we’ve done.

11
00:00:15,330 --> 00:00:16,860
We’ve done a lot of cosplaying.

12
00:00:16,130 --> 00:00:17,360
For the bus tour.

13
00:00:16,860 --> 00:00:18,930
Yep, that’s what we did.

14
00:00:17,360 --> 00:00:19,360
This time, it’s Pink Lady.*

15
00:00:17,360 --> 00:00:22,000
*Translator’s notes: Pink Lady was a J-Pop duo from the 70s.

16
00:00:19,460 --> 00:00:20,700
Indeed, Pink Lady.

17
00:00:20,700 --> 00:00:22,700
That’s what the decision came to.

18
00:00:21,730 --> 00:00:28,340
Rules:

19
00:00:21,730 --> 00:00:28,340
The games will take place inside the bus. The duo who loses 3 times must be dropped off in the middle of the city and they must sing and dance like Pink Lady.

20
00:00:22,070 --> 00:00:25,200
Yes, when I heard that we’re going to be doing Pink Lady, I knew I definitely had to be Mie-chan.*

21
00:00:22,070 --> 00:00:30,690
*Translator’s notes: Real name is Mitsuya Nemoto, but went by the stage name, Mie-chan.

22
00:00:25,200 --> 00:00:28,340
That was the case so... I was graciously given the role of Mie-chan.

23
00:00:26,770 --> 00:00:28,240
Oh is that so…

24
00:00:28,240 --> 00:00:30,210
Well, that’s okay with me, I don’t really care.

25
00:00:30,710 --> 00:00:33,180
Let's bring out the participants,

26
00:00:33,180 --> 00:00:35,180
the first duo is the following!

27
00:00:37,210 --> 00:00:39,680
Yamasaki is partnered up with Director Komurasaki, commonly acknowledged

28
00:00:38,220 --> 00:00:44,390
Komurasaki Kozo (Director)

29
00:00:38,220 --> 00:00:44,390
Yamasaki Hosei

30
00:00:39,680 --> 00:00:42,080
as Yamasaki’s most trusted friend at the moment.

31
00:00:40,180 --> 00:00:44,390
Competing as “Wanted”!

32
00:00:42,080 --> 00:00:44,490
They’re competing as Pink Lady from their hit, “Wanted"!

33
00:00:44,790 --> 00:00:46,890
What the hell is this.

34
00:00:45,460 --> 00:00:48,060
This is a duo fight, why the hell are you two together?

35
00:00:48,390 --> 00:00:50,390
Well, Komu (Komurasaki)…

36
00:00:49,360 --> 00:00:51,900
Where’s this confidence coming from?

37
00:00:51,900 --> 00:00:53,900
It’s like you’re saying, “Feel free to praise me.”

38
00:00:54,200 --> 00:00:55,600
So creepy…

39
00:00:55,600 --> 00:00:57,600
Thank ya.

40
00:00:56,470 --> 00:00:58,470
Thank ya.

41
00:00:59,640 --> 00:01:02,910
Cocorico wraps themselves in a blue one-piece dress and

42
00:01:01,470 --> 00:01:05,580
Cocorico

43
00:01:01,470 --> 00:01:05,580
Endo Shozo

44
00:01:01,470 --> 00:01:05,580

00:01:02,570 --> 00:01:05,580
Competing as "Nagisa no Sinbad!"

46
00:01:02,910 --> 00:01:05,980
enters the battle as the million-seller hit, “Nagisa no Sinbad”!

47
00:01:06,040 --> 00:01:09,250
Last week, you let Heipo ride on your shoulders

48
00:01:09,250 --> 00:01:11,510
And you were hospitalized for a day.

49
00:01:11,810 --> 00:01:14,280
I didn’t think that Heipo would be such a heavy guy.

50
00:01:13,250 --> 00:01:17,120
Heipo of the World.

51
00:01:14,280 --> 00:01:16,250
That man is like 70kg! (About 154 lbs)

52
00:01:15,580 --> 00:01:17,120
Sounds about right.

53
00:01:17,220 --> 00:01:20,060
Endo says he doesn’t know anything about Pink Lady.

54
00:01:19,660 --> 00:01:21,660
Oh really?

55
00:01:20,160 --> 00:01:23,390
I don’t have a bad back or anything but…

56
00:01:23,390 --> 00:01:25,430
I can’t dance or sing, at all.

57
00:01:26,630 --> 00:01:28,660
Our guest duo is Cream Stew.

58
00:01:28,160 --> 00:01:32,830

00:01:28,160 --> 00:01:32,830

61
00:01:28,660 --> 00:01:30,930
After taking elaborate dance lessons,

62
00:01:29,260 --> 00:01:32,830
Competing as "Carmen '77"!

63
00:01:30,930 --> 00:01:33,270
they will be competing as “Carmen ‘77”!

64
00:01:33,300 --> 00:01:35,300
Hello hello.

65
00:01:36,140 --> 00:01:39,170
Alright, let’s hurry up and battle and then just go home.

66
00:01:39,210 --> 00:01:40,840
Why are you treating us like a rush job?

67
00:01:40,840 --> 00:01:43,210
You guys were part of the Pink Lady generation

68
00:01:43,210 --> 00:01:49,080
I loved Pink Lady so I was extremely excited to go with this song.

69
00:01:52,920 --> 00:01:56,220
The Chihara Brothers make an appearance on Gaki no Tsukai for the first time.

70
00:01:54,290 --> 00:01:59,130

Competing as “UFO”!

74
00:01:56,220 --> 00:01:59,520
The tall duo will be cosplaying as the big hit, “UFO” for this occasion!

75
00:01:59,630 --> 00:02:01,890
This is hideous.

76
00:02:04,070 --> 00:02:06,070
You two are huge.

77
00:02:06,070 --> 00:02:08,570
Our sister looks like this.

78
00:02:09,800 --> 00:02:12,710
Everyone, I hope you understand, this is supposed to be a batsu game.

79
00:02:11,640 --> 00:02:12,710
Yes, yes.

80
00:02:12,710 --> 00:02:14,340
Don’t be shy.

81
00:02:14,340 --> 00:02:18,080
Well, it only sucks if you lose. If you win, it’s fine.

82
00:02:17,380 --> 00:02:18,080
Yeah, alright.

83
00:02:18,080 --> 00:02:23,050
Okay, we have everyone gathered, let’s get this started.

84
00:02:25,690 --> 00:02:28,720

87
00:02:34,460 --> 00:02:36,490
All right, I’m going to present our first game!

88
00:02:36,500 --> 00:02:37,060
Yes!

89
00:02:37,060 --> 00:02:40,060
Mie-chan, Kei-chan game!

90
00:02:43,440 --> 00:02:47,040
It’s very simple. For example, I say “Mie-chan” and point.

91
00:02:45,370 --> 00:02:52,110
Mie-chan, Kei-chan Game Rules:

92
00:02:45,370 --> 00:02:52,110
Yell, “Mie-chan” then “Kei-chan”, in which you must point at a person after the name. The two people sitting next to the person who gets “Kei-chan” must say “UFO” and pose.

93
00:02:47,040 --> 00:02:48,640
And the person who gets pointed at says

94
00:02:48,140 --> 00:02:48,640
Kei-chan.

95
00:02:48,640 --> 00:02:49,640
And then that person is Kei-chan.

96
00:02:49,640 --> 00:02:52,480
And then next to Kei-chan on both sides have to pose and say, “UFO!”

97
00:02:52,780 --> 00:02:56,150
Alright then, Mie-chan, Kei-chan Game, START!!

98
00:02:55,210 --> 00:02:58,210
Game Start!

99
00:03:16,540 --> 00:03:18,540
Nope! No good!

100
00:03:16,540 --> 00:03:19,540
Cream Stew:


Ueda is OUT

101
00:03:20,170 --> 00:03:21,610
That was just strange.

102
00:03:27,850 --> 00:03:30,720
Let’s start with the one who messed up, Ueda!

103
00:03:28,410 --> 00:03:33,620
Chihara
Brothers

104
00:03:28,410 --> 00:03:33,620

Yamasaki
& Komu:

116
00:03:47,500 --> 00:03:48,930
Alright, let’s start with Junior.

117
00:03:48,130 --> 00:03:48,930
Okay.

118
00:04:06,180 --> 00:04:07,780

Oi!

121
00:04:09,850 --> 00:04:11,820
It’s because it’s here and here.

122
00:04:11,820 --> 00:04:13,820
Wait then…

123
00:04:14,890 --> 00:04:21,460
Watch carefully! Director Komurasaki hides his mistake.

124
00:04:21,530 --> 00:04:23,530
Okay, we’ll start with Endo.

125
00:04:21,830 --> 00:04:27,070
Chihara
Brothers

126
00:04:21,830 --> 00:04:27,070

Downtown:

First to make 3 mistakes gets a batsu game!

130
00:04:21,830 --> 00:04:27,070
Yamasaki
& Komu:

131
00:04:32,270 --> 00:04:35,280
Downtown:


Matsumoto is OUT

132
00:04:32,880 --> 00:04:34,880
What the hell!

133
00:04:35,010 --> 00:04:37,010
Yes!! Woo hoo!

134
00:04:37,310 --> 00:04:38,380
Hold on a minute!

135
00:04:38,380 --> 00:04:41,020
I SERIOUSLY wasn’t paying attention.

136
00:04:42,420 --> 00:04:43,550
I’m gonna pick up the pace.

137
00:04:43,550 --> 00:04:44,150
That’s fine.

138
00:04:44,150 --> 00:04:45,920
You’re going to increase the tempo?

139
00:04:44,790 --> 00:04:45,920
Yup, faster tempo.

140
00:04:49,830 --> 00:04:51,260
You didn’t say it!

141
00:04:51,260 --> 00:04:53,430
He definitely didn’t say, “UFO”!!

142
00:04:53,860 --> 00:04:54,930
What does everyone say?

143
00:04:54,930 --> 00:04:56,900
Out, very out.

144
00:04:56,160 --> 00:04:59,170
Cream Stew



IN DANGER!

145
00:04:57,330 --> 00:04:59,330
Wait, does that mean for the both of us?!

146
00:05:00,140 --> 00:05:05,440
From here, the development heats up with the Chihara Brothers continuing into the danger zone right after Cream Stew.

147
00:05:05,940 --> 00:05:11,380
And following that, Director Komurasaki messes up, which brings the Yamasaki and Komu duo also in the danger zone!

148
00:05:12,080 --> 00:05:17,650
However, Tanaka makes a mistake and now Cocorico is in the running for the batsu game!

149
00:05:18,650 --> 00:05:20,650
So Downtown is still safe.

150
00:05:19,520 --> 00:05:21,520
Wait, so everyone is in danger except for us?

151
00:05:20,790 --> 00:05:25,060
Chihara
Brothers

152
00:05:20,790 --> 00:05:25,060
Cocorico:

153
00:05:20,790 --> 00:05:25,060
Cream
Stew:

154
00:05:20,790 --> 00:05:25,060
Downtown:

155
00:05:20,790 --> 00:05:25,060
Everyone but Downtown in danger!

156
00:05:20,790 --> 00:05:25,060
Yamasaki
& Komu:

157
00:05:20,960 --> 00:05:22,960
Shit shit shit shit shit

158
00:05:23,220 --> 00:05:24,260
Okay, starting with Tanaka.

159
00:05:24,260 --> 00:05:25,230
Here I go.

160
00:05:28,330 --> 00:05:32,230
You didn’t say it!

161
00:05:29,860 --> 00:05:32,870
Downtown:


Matsumoto is OUT

162
00:05:32,400 --> 00:05:34,940
No no, I said it all at once!

163
00:05:32,870 --> 00:05:34,870
Downtown



IN DANGER!

164
00:05:34,940 --> 00:05:39,040
I said, “UFO! ...You know.” I even added “you know”!

165
00:05:39,040 --> 00:05:42,240
All in. Going all in.

166
00:05:39,440 --> 00:05:44,380
Chihara
Brothers

167
00:05:39,440 --> 00:05:44,380
Cocorico:

168
00:05:39,440 --> 00:05:44,380
Cream
Stew:

169
00:05:39,440 --> 00:05:44,380
Downtown:

170
00:05:39,440 --> 00:05:44,380
Everyone in danger!

171
00:05:39,440 --> 00:05:44,380
Yamasaki
& Komu:

172
00:05:58,490 --> 00:06:00,490
You didn’t say it!

173
00:05:59,440 --> 00:06:02,490
Damnit!!

174
00:06:01,360 --> 00:06:05,600
Cocorico


Batsu Game!

175
00:06:03,030 --> 00:06:05,030
It was you!

176
00:06:04,000 --> 00:06:06,030
Daaaamnit!!

177
00:06:06,070 --> 00:06:08,030
You only said, “FO!”

178
00:06:07,030 --> 00:06:08,030
Only “FO!”

179
00:06:12,240 --> 00:06:14,240
You only said “FO!"

180
00:06:12,240 --> 00:06:14,240
You only said “FO!”

181
00:06:13,170 --> 00:06:16,210
Why is it bad if I say only, “FO”?

182
00:06:16,280 --> 00:06:19,450
It’s been decided, it’s Cocorico!

183
00:06:17,180 --> 00:06:20,110
No! I don’t want this!

184
00:06:20,650 --> 00:06:22,650
I’m sorry! I’m really sorry!

185
00:06:22,650 --> 00:06:24,650
I don’t want this!!

186
00:06:24,850 --> 00:06:28,250
But really, Tanaka, you were weird the entire time.

187
00:06:28,250 --> 00:06:31,690
When someone points at you, you’re just like…

188
00:06:33,330 --> 00:06:37,360
Alright, for Cocorico, go to Big Echo in Hibiya, the karaoke shop located along the main street.

189
00:06:37,360 --> 00:06:42,170
Go to the second floor to sing and dance on the terrace.

190
00:06:42,170 --> 00:06:44,770
It’s a place where people will pass by the immediate vicinity.

191
00:06:42,200 --> 00:06:48,840
Batsu Game Location

192
00:06:42,200 --> 00:06:48,840
Big Echo in Yurakucho on the second floor terrace

193
00:06:44,770 --> 00:06:46,040
Isn’t that it right there?

194
00:06:46,040 --> 00:06:46,470
Where?

195
00:06:46,470 --> 00:06:48,040
That one, it says Big Echo.

196
00:06:48,040 --> 00:06:50,040
Get going then.

197
00:06:51,180 --> 00:06:54,710
On your way there, there’s tons of people waiting for the light.

198
00:06:54,710 --> 00:06:56,980
You're right.

199
00:06:57,480 --> 00:07:00,620
Be sure to tell them that this is “Miracle Type”*

200
00:06:57,480 --> 00:07:05,990
*Translator’s notes: Miracle Type was a variety show that Cocorico hosted.

201
00:07:00,620 --> 00:07:02,350
I’m just gonna say this is for “Gaki”.

202
00:07:02,350 --> 00:07:04,460
Why can’t I just say it’s “Gaki no Tsukai”!

203
00:07:04,460 --> 00:07:06,460
Why do I have to do something so embarrassing?

204
00:07:08,530 --> 00:07:10,430
Oh geez, it’s so cold!

205
00:07:10,430 --> 00:07:12,030
Wow, really cold.

206
00:07:12,030 --> 00:07:15,270
This is no good.

207
00:07:16,370 --> 00:07:17,500
Let’s finish this up and go.

208
00:07:17,200 --> 00:07:18,770
Yeah, seriously.

209
00:07:18,270 --> 00:07:20,270
This is so sad.

210
00:07:23,910 --> 00:07:26,040
Oh wow, it’s outdoors.

211
00:07:24,870 --> 00:07:26,040
Yes indeed.

212
00:07:26,110 --> 00:07:28,110
Hey, it’s looking kinda cool with the lights.

213
00:07:28,140 --> 00:07:29,950
Oh yeah, true!

214
00:07:29,950 --> 00:07:31,950
I’m a bit jealous.

215
00:07:38,820 --> 00:07:40,820
It's starting.

216
00:07:40,060 --> 00:07:46,360
Vocals: Cocorico

217
00:07:40,060 --> 00:07:46,360
“Nagisa no Sinbad” (1977 - One-million copies sold)

218
00:07:48,860 --> 00:07:50,770
They look cool!

219
00:07:50,770 --> 00:07:52,770
As if!

220
00:08:05,710 --> 00:08:09,000
They look like they’re representatives of the city.

221
00:08:07,380 --> 00:08:09,380
You’re right.

222
00:08:49,690 --> 00:08:52,460
If you were going to do this, this was the ideal spot.

223
00:08:51,860 --> 00:08:53,860
Yes, that’s true.

224
00:08:54,060 --> 00:08:57,400
Doing this at eye-level would be difficult.

225
00:08:57,930 --> 00:08:58,730
Right.

226
00:08:59,100 --> 00:09:01,100
Good job, guys.

227
00:08:59,970 --> 00:09:01,970
Good job!

228
00:09:02,970 --> 00:09:04,970
I know how you feel.

229
00:09:08,110 --> 00:09:09,880
Well, it was good, wasn’t it?

230
00:09:09,880 --> 00:09:14,150
It was amazing though, being exposed like that, just to let you know.

231
00:09:14,150 --> 00:09:16,920
Yeah, it was no good to be walking through there.

232
00:09:16,920 --> 00:09:19,020
We were caught at the traffic light.

233
00:09:19,090 --> 00:09:21,850
Alright, well, that’s enough of that.

234
00:09:23,190 --> 00:09:25,190
Continuing on, the next game is

235
00:09:25,190 --> 00:09:27,190
Dandy Sakano Game!*

236
00:09:25,190 --> 00:09:36,770
*Translator’s notes: Dandy Sakano is another Japanese comedian, known for his catchphrase, “Gets!”

237
00:09:28,960 --> 00:09:36,770
Dandy Sakano Game Rules:

238
00:09:28,960 --> 00:09:36,770
Yell, “Dandy” then “Sakano”, in which you must point at a person after the name. The two people sitting next to the person who gets “Sakano” must say “Gets!” and pose.

239
00:09:30,530 --> 00:09:31,800
This is just like the previous game.

240
00:09:31,800 --> 00:09:35,330
Dandy, Sakano, then both sides say, “Gets!”

241
00:09:36,370 --> 00:09:37,640
Ugh.

242
00:09:37,640 --> 00:09:42,270
Hold on, shall we shuffle then?

243
00:09:39,100 --> 00:09:42,270
Our seats?

244
00:09:39,940 --> 00:09:42,270
Yeah, let’s switch seats.

245
00:09:42,970 --> 00:09:44,970
Switch seats and game start!

246
00:09:49,210 --> 00:09:51,210
Hold on a minute!

247
00:09:51,620 --> 00:09:53,020
Hey, everyone!

248
00:09:53,050 --> 00:09:55,050
Cocorico, what do you think of this?

249
00:09:55,190 --> 00:09:58,420
Wait, Komu, do I have something stuck here?

250
00:09:56,990 --> 00:10:00,430
What the hell! No way. So cliche.

251
00:09:57,890 --> 00:10:00,430
You totally raised your hand!

252
00:10:00,860 --> 00:10:03,860
Yamasaki & Komu:


Yamasaki is OUT

253
00:10:02,860 --> 00:10:05,060
When you put your hand to your throat and say, “Komu, do I have something stuck here?”

254
00:10:05,060 --> 00:10:06,730
That was no good.

255
00:10:05,800 --> 00:10:07,800
Awful.

256
00:10:06,730 --> 00:10:07,870
That was the bad part.

257
00:10:07,870 --> 00:10:09,500
That was really cliche.

258
00:10:10,370 --> 00:10:16,440
Arita of Cream Stew still can’t seem to grasp the rules of the game.

259
00:10:16,970 --> 00:10:22,710
In addition, Chihara Junior breaks his concentration and the guest duo are back in the heat of battle.

260
00:10:22,980 --> 00:10:24,980
Downtown is very strong.

261
00:10:23,350 --> 00:10:26,820
Chihara
Brothers:

262
00:10:23,350 --> 00:10:26,820
Cream
Stew:

263
00:10:23,350 --> 00:10:26,820
Downtown:

264
00:10:23,350 --> 00:10:26,820
First to make 3 mistakes gets a batsu game!

265
00:10:23,350 --> 00:10:26,820
Yamasaki &
Komu:

266
00:10:24,210 --> 00:10:25,520
Alright, let’s go!

267
00:10:25,520 --> 00:10:26,850
Starting with Junior!

268
00:10:29,920 --> 00:10:31,920
No, not me.

269
00:10:30,690 --> 00:10:32,750
Yes!

270
00:10:31,290 --> 00:10:35,290
Downtown:


Hamada is OUT

271
00:10:31,290 --> 00:10:35,290
Pointed at Endo who is already out.

272
00:10:37,090 --> 00:10:41,870
I can’t even laugh, he’s senile. Senile in his forties.

273
00:10:41,870 --> 00:10:43,870
Then we shouldn’t be laughing.

274
00:10:44,000 --> 00:10:48,270
Chihara
Brothers:

275
00:10:44,000 --> 00:10:48,270
Cream
Stew:

276
00:10:44,000 --> 00:10:48,270
Downtown:

277
00:10:44,000 --> 00:10:48,270
First to make 3 mistakes gets a batsu game!

278
00:10:44,000 --> 00:10:48,270
Yamasaki &
Komu:

279
00:10:44,370 --> 00:10:46,070
Hamada, please start.

280
00:10:49,440 --> 00:10:51,440
Hold on right there!

281
00:10:51,910 --> 00:10:53,910
Wait a minute, wait!

282
00:10:52,040 --> 00:10:54,040
Before that…

283
00:10:54,180 --> 00:10:56,550
How about this guy!!

284
00:10:56,550 --> 00:10:57,550
No way!

285
00:10:57,300 --> 00:11:00,210
He didn’t say “Gets”!

286
00:10:58,210 --> 00:11:00,210
He didn’t say it! He didn’t say it!

287
00:10:58,610 --> 00:11:00,610
You didn’t say it.

288
00:11:00,580 --> 00:11:04,420
Downtown



IN DANGER!

289
00:11:00,620 --> 00:11:03,720
The hell, why are YOU saying I didn’t say it!

290
00:11:04,950 --> 00:11:07,620
You didn’t though.

291
00:11:07,620 --> 00:11:11,160
No, no, I thought, “What’s the point in me saying it?”

292
00:11:11,260 --> 00:11:13,730
Out!!

293
00:11:14,230 --> 00:11:16,230
Downtown is in danger!

294
00:11:15,500 --> 00:11:17,500
Senile people everywhere.

295
00:11:24,910 --> 00:11:29,110
Downtown


Batsu Game!

296
00:11:26,210 --> 00:11:29,280
Wait, what? Did he point at him?

297
00:11:29,640 --> 00:11:32,640
You just had this dull look on your face.

298
00:11:34,350 --> 00:11:35,950
Downtown

299
00:11:35,950 --> 00:11:44,160
You’ll be dropped off in the middle of Roppongi in front of Don Quijote where there are plenty of people there to go shopping.

300
00:11:44,530 --> 00:11:48,330
Hold on, I still can’t get over his mistake.

301
00:11:48,330 --> 00:11:54,570
He points at Endo, then he does absolutely nothing.

302
00:11:54,570 --> 00:11:57,970
He’s just there as if he didn’t do anything wrong.

303
00:11:58,340 --> 00:12:00,340
We’ve arrived.

304
00:11:58,340 --> 00:12:02,840
Roppongi Intersection

305
00:12:03,010 --> 00:12:07,010
Look at all those people.

306
00:12:09,250 --> 00:12:16,360
Don Quijote Roppongi Branch Entrance

307
00:12:10,080 --> 00:12:11,220
Right here?

308
00:12:11,220 --> 00:12:12,890
This is gonna suck.

309
00:12:12,890 --> 00:12:15,890
Oh man, this will be hard.

310
00:12:16,760 --> 00:12:22,730
Alright, Downtown.

311
00:12:18,430 --> 00:12:22,730
Your performance, please!

312
00:12:23,700 --> 00:12:26,700
Senile duo!

313
00:12:34,610 --> 00:12:36,570
So embarrassing!

314
00:12:38,080 --> 00:12:44,350
Vocals: Downtown

315
00:12:38,080 --> 00:12:44,350
“South Paw” (1978 - 1,460,000 copies sold)

316
00:12:45,850 --> 00:12:47,850
Oh wow, they’re really doing it well.

317
00:13:01,630 --> 00:13:03,630
They’re not even staying to watch!!

318
00:13:16,180 --> 00:13:18,180
No reaction.

319
00:13:17,320 --> 00:13:19,320
No reaction at all.

320
00:13:17,680 --> 00:13:19,680
You aren’t kidding.

321
00:13:19,420 --> 00:13:21,420
They won’t even laugh for them.

322
00:13:21,420 --> 00:13:23,550
Maybe they’re creeped out?

323
00:13:24,620 --> 00:13:26,860
Yeah, they’re probably creeped out.

324
00:13:33,060 --> 00:13:35,060
No one’s watching.

325
00:14:09,670 --> 00:14:11,670
What’re they doing right there?

326
00:14:17,240 --> 00:14:18,070
Good job.

327
00:14:18,070 --> 00:14:20,070
Good job back there!

328
00:14:22,410 --> 00:14:24,150
That was amazing…

329
00:14:24,150 --> 00:14:26,680
I knew that no one was laughing.

330
00:14:26,680 --> 00:14:28,680
The people walking by didn’t care either.

331
00:14:28,720 --> 00:14:30,920
They didn’t watch, huh?

332
00:14:31,190 --> 00:14:33,190
You know, you actually don’t feel the cold out there.

333
00:14:33,190 --> 00:14:35,190
Yeah, you don’t feel it.

334
00:14:35,390 --> 00:14:38,390
When we first went outside, we were like, “Wow, it’s cold,” but yeah.

335
00:14:38,390 --> 00:14:41,890
Because your body was burning with embarrassment?

336
00:14:43,330 --> 00:14:45,230
That was good, right?

337
00:14:45,230 --> 00:14:49,470
If that’s how they’ll react to Downtown, we’re screwed.

338
00:14:50,240 --> 00:14:52,240
Okay, I’ll be presenting the next game!

339
00:14:51,910 --> 00:14:52,570
Alright!

340
00:14:52,570 --> 00:14:56,810
The next game is Antonio Inoki Dahhh!* Game!

341
00:14:52,570 --> 00:15:03,680
*Translator’s notes: Antonio Inoki was a professional wrestler. He’s well-known for yelling 1, 2, 3, DAHHH!

342
00:14:56,680 --> 00:15:03,450
Antonio Inoki Dahhh! Game Rules:

343
00:14:56,680 --> 00:15:03,450
Yell, “Antonio” then “Inoki”, in which you must point at a person after the name. The two people sitting next to the person who gets “Inoki” must say “Dahhh!” and pose.

344
00:14:59,310 --> 00:15:00,620
You already know the rules, right?

345
00:15:00,620 --> 00:15:03,680
Antonio, then Inoki, then both sides say, “Dahhh!”

346
00:15:04,350 --> 00:15:06,350
Switch seats and game start!

347
00:15:13,630 --> 00:15:15,630
You’re not saying anything!

348
00:15:15,300 --> 00:15:18,300
Cream Stew:


Arita is OUT

349
00:15:18,170 --> 00:15:18,970
Come on…

350
00:15:18,970 --> 00:15:21,500
What are you, an orangutan?

351
00:15:21,540 --> 00:15:26,310
Chihara
Brothers

352
00:15:21,540 --> 00:15:26,310
Cream
Stew:

353
00:15:21,540 --> 00:15:26,310
First to make 3 mistakes gets a batsu game!

354
00:15:21,540 --> 00:15:26,310
Yamasaki &
Komu:

355
00:15:38,220 --> 00:15:41,220
Hold on, you’re way too slow!

356
00:15:41,220 --> 00:15:42,860
Too slow.

357
00:15:42,360 --> 00:15:44,360
You’re just like, “Dahhhh…”

358
00:15:42,860 --> 00:15:46,130
It should be more like “Antonio, Inoki, Dahhh!”

359
00:15:45,630 --> 00:15:47,630
That’s too fast!

360
00:15:45,930 --> 00:15:47,930
We can’t do that!

361
00:15:46,660 --> 00:15:49,760
We can even do that! We can even do it, right guys?

362
00:15:49,760 --> 00:15:51,760
Then show us an example.

363
00:15:53,300 --> 00:15:55,840
You guys were all messed up!

364
00:15:56,940 --> 00:16:01,910
At this point, Yamasaki, who seemed to be good at the game, makes an unusual mistake.

365
00:16:02,640 --> 00:16:07,480
In addition, Chihara Junior slips up which brings all three teams into a big close match.

366
00:16:08,080 --> 00:16:11,550
Chihara
Brothers

367
00:16:08,080 --> 00:16:11,550
Cream
Stew:

368
00:16:08,080 --> 00:16:11,550
First to make 3 mistakes gets a batsu game!

369
00:16:08,080 --> 00:16:11,550
Yamasaki &
Komu:

370
00:16:22,590 --> 00:16:24,100
That’s enough!

371
00:16:24,100 --> 00:16:24,960
That’s enough.

372
00:16:24,960 --> 00:16:27,370
Are you guys the bus’ engine?

373
00:16:28,700 --> 00:16:32,440
Is that what this bus is running on?

374
00:16:33,670 --> 00:16:37,340
Even at this stage of the game, Chihara Junior can’t follow the rhythm and gets 2 mistakes in a row.

375
00:16:37,360 --> 00:16:39,410
Chihara Brothers are in danger!

376
00:16:39,980 --> 00:16:43,950
Chihara
Brothers

377
00:16:39,980 --> 00:16:43,950
Cream
Stew:

378
00:16:39,980 --> 00:16:43,950
First to make 3 mistakes gets a batsu game!

379
00:16:39,980 --> 00:16:43,950
Yamasaki &
Komu:

380
00:16:51,860 --> 00:16:53,490
Wasn’t that too slow?!

381
00:16:53,490 --> 00:16:55,490
What the hell are you doing?

382
00:16:54,060 --> 00:16:56,060
Why are you stopping?

383
00:16:56,990 --> 00:16:58,730
Why did you stop?!

384
00:16:58,730 --> 00:17:00,330
That was just fine, wasn’t it?

385
00:16:59,630 --> 00:17:00,330
That was fine!

386
00:17:00,330 --> 00:17:02,330
Chihara Brothers!!

387
00:17:02,430 --> 00:17:06,840
Chihara Brothers


Batsu Game!

388
00:17:04,270 --> 00:17:08,440
That was totally… Totally off! Wasn’t it?!

389
00:17:08,440 --> 00:17:10,440
No no no, that was not off.

390
00:17:09,970 --> 00:17:12,740
Ehhh? How was that off?!

391
00:17:12,740 --> 00:17:16,050
What is up with your phrasing?

392
00:17:16,210 --> 00:17:19,350
It’s all your damn fault.

393
00:17:19,350 --> 00:17:21,480
I’ll apologize if it makes you feel any better.

394
00:17:21,480 --> 00:17:23,190
You don’t need to apologize.

395
00:17:23,190 --> 00:17:25,760
In fact, you should be pissed off. He’s just accusing you.

396
00:17:25,760 --> 00:17:34,610
*Translator’s notes: Daikanyama is a very chic and trendy area in Shibuya, Tokyo.

397
00:17:25,760 --> 00:17:34,610
For Chihara Brothers, go to Japan’s #1 fashionable area Daikanyama* and sing and dance at an outdoor cafe.

398
00:17:33,530 --> 00:17:34,630
I wouldn’t want that!

399
00:17:34,830 --> 00:17:40,570
Batsu game location

400
00:17:34,830 --> 00:17:40,570
Cafe terrace “Lloyd Cafe” in Daikanyama

401
00:17:35,330 --> 00:17:38,370
It’s this place, here, here.

402
00:17:38,370 --> 00:17:39,470
This is harsh.

403
00:17:39,470 --> 00:17:40,740
It’s completely empty.

404
00:17:41,040 --> 00:17:45,110
The people inside the cafe are really staring.

405
00:17:45,410 --> 00:17:47,080
Do your best!

406
00:17:45,710 --> 00:17:47,080
Just hurry up and go.

407
00:17:47,540 --> 00:17:48,180
Oh hell

408
00:17:48,180 --> 00:17:49,480
So cold!

409
00:17:48,180 --> 00:17:49,480
So cold!

410
00:17:51,480 --> 00:17:53,480
Here they are!

411
00:17:54,580 --> 00:17:55,780
They’re hesitating.

412
00:17:55,780 --> 00:17:58,780
These guys, you know, they’re brothers.

413
00:18:02,160 --> 00:18:05,160
This must suck.

414
00:18:03,690 --> 00:18:09,500
Vocals: Chihara Brothers

415
00:18:03,690 --> 00:18:09,500
“UFO” (1977 - 1,550,000 copies sold)

416
00:18:08,130 --> 00:18:11,130
This is grossing me out.

417
00:18:30,750 --> 00:18:32,750
They’re causing a disturbance.

418
00:18:35,820 --> 00:18:38,820
They’re brothers, you know.

419
00:18:43,300 --> 00:18:45,600
I can’t watch this.

420
00:18:44,200 --> 00:18:46,500
Me either.

421
00:19:13,630 --> 00:19:16,130
Should we just leave?

422
00:19:16,930 --> 00:19:17,930
Start driving!

423
00:19:17,930 --> 00:19:19,630
Get the bus going!

424
00:19:19,000 --> 00:19:19,630
Let’s go, let’s go.

425
00:19:22,030 --> 00:19:24,130
What the hell are you doing?!

426
00:19:24,300 --> 00:19:30,580
Chihara Brothers

427
00:19:24,300 --> 00:19:30,580
Left behind in Daikanyama while still dressed as Pink Lady!

428
00:19:24,670 --> 00:19:27,170
What the hell are you doing?!!

429
00:19:27,170 --> 00:19:28,210
What the hell?!!

430
00:19:28,210 --> 00:19:29,540
Bye bye!

431
00:19:28,840 --> 00:19:31,070
What the hell!

432
00:19:32,080 --> 00:19:38,680
*Translator’s notes: Takeda Tetsuya is an actor and singer, most well-known for his role as Kinpachi Sensei in the Kinpachi Sensei J-drama series.

433
00:19:32,080 --> 00:19:38,680
Alright, we’ve only got 1 game left and for the last round, it’ll be Takeda Tetsuya Game!

434
00:19:37,850 --> 00:19:38,680
This is a standard one.

435
00:19:39,720 --> 00:19:45,290
In the last round of the batsu game, there’s only 2 teams competing. Arita, still unable to get the hang of the game, is out!

436
00:19:45,290 --> 00:19:51,700
Continuing on, Yamasaki makes an unlikely mistake and the game alternates the losses!

437
00:19:53,600 --> 00:19:57,840
Furthermore, when the game switches over to Senda Mitsuo*...

438
00:19:53,600 --> 00:20:00,070
Translator's notes: Senda Mitsuo is a voice actor who has been voice acting in many major animes and dubbed for big Hollywood movies.

439
00:19:57,570 --> 00:19:59,570
Cream Stew



IN DANGER!

440
00:19:57,840 --> 00:20:00,070
Cream Stew is in danger!

441
00:20:00,600 --> 00:20:03,410
Alright, the game might or might not end here.

442
00:20:00,700 --> 00:20:06,140
Cream Stew in danger!

443
00:20:00,700 --> 00:20:06,140
Cream
Stew:

444
00:20:00,700 --> 00:20:06,140
Yamasaki &
Komu:

445
00:20:03,410 --> 00:20:06,480
*Translator’s notes: Shimura Ken is a comedian who usually plays the foolish character. Aiin is a nonsensical phrase that he made up and became popular in Japanese media.

446
00:20:03,410 --> 00:20:06,480
Next is Shimura Ken Aiin.*

447
00:20:21,390 --> 00:20:23,390
What the hell!

448
00:20:24,560 --> 00:20:29,300
Cream Stew


Batsu Game!

449
00:20:26,160 --> 00:20:27,560
Get a grip, goddamnit!

450
00:20:27,560 --> 00:20:30,770
Arita, it’s a miracle that you even made it this far.

451
00:20:30,770 --> 00:20:33,440
Alright, now for Cream Stew.

452
00:20:33,440 --> 00:20:35,940
Location is Odaiba.*

453
00:20:33,440 --> 00:20:41,440
*Translator’s note: Odaiba is a city in Tokyo, built on an artificial island. It is a major commercial and leisure area with accessible seashores.

454
00:20:36,210 --> 00:20:38,040
Odaiba is a tough one…

455
00:20:38,340 --> 00:20:41,180
Not only that, it’s at the beach.

456
00:20:41,710 --> 00:20:44,080
There’s no way anyone would be there, right? Geez!

457
00:20:41,710 --> 00:20:44,080
Why the beach?

458
00:20:44,080 --> 00:20:46,080
It’s pitch black outside.

459
00:20:44,610 --> 00:20:47,550
We’ll just look like we’re having a normal Pink Lady practice.

460
00:20:47,550 --> 00:20:50,050
In such a place, in such a situation.

461
00:20:50,620 --> 00:20:53,120
What’s going to happen? The bus stopped.

462
00:20:51,650 --> 00:20:53,900
It’s right there. Right there.

463
00:20:54,890 --> 00:20:59,460
Batsu game location

464
00:20:54,890 --> 00:20:59,460
Sandy shores of the Odaiba Beachfront Park

465
00:20:55,260 --> 00:20:57,360
There isn’t even one person around!

466
00:20:57,360 --> 00:20:59,630
There really is nobody around!

467
00:21:01,960 --> 00:21:03,870
Oh god, it’s so cold!

468
00:21:03,870 --> 00:21:05,330
So damn cold.

469
00:21:05,700 --> 00:21:06,900
Do your best.

470
00:21:06,900 --> 00:21:09,070
Please do your best.

471
00:21:08,140 --> 00:21:10,140
It’s so damn cold.

472
00:21:11,740 --> 00:21:13,070
So cold!

473
00:21:13,070 --> 00:21:15,880
Why is it only Ueda who keeps saying it’s cold?

474
00:21:14,710 --> 00:21:16,410
You’re right.

475
00:21:16,010 --> 00:21:18,010
So cold!

476
00:21:16,410 --> 00:21:20,050
There must be something wrong with Arita.

477
00:21:18,250 --> 00:21:20,050
Something’s wrong with his bodily senses.

478
00:21:22,080 --> 00:21:28,390
Vocals: Cream Stew

479
00:21:22,080 --> 00:21:28,390
“Carmen ‘77” (1977 - 660,000 copies sold)

480
00:21:39,100 --> 00:21:41,030
Fast, very fast

481
00:21:39,830 --> 00:21:41,830
This is pretty good!

482
00:22:01,990 --> 00:22:03,990
Whoa, amazing!

483
00:22:10,100 --> 00:22:13,100
Oh, people are actually passing by.

484
00:22:16,000 --> 00:22:19,000
(Hamada also singing along)

485
00:22:21,910 --> 00:22:24,910
Arita is really tone-deaf.

486
00:22:40,430 --> 00:22:42,160
Something ran by, a dog ran by!

487
00:22:42,860 --> 00:22:44,760
We did it with all of our strength!

488
00:22:44,760 --> 00:22:46,230
Where?

489
00:22:46,230 --> 00:22:48,230
We were right over there!

490
00:22:48,230 --> 00:22:50,230
Huh? We didn’t notice.

491
00:22:48,700 --> 00:22:50,700
We were there, if you just looked to the left!

492
00:22:51,440 --> 00:22:54,470
Sorry about that, we were discussing what to do next week.

493
00:22:54,470 --> 00:22:56,770
You don’t have to do that now!

494
00:22:56,770 --> 00:22:58,810
Someone better confirm that we did the entire song.

495
00:22:58,810 --> 00:23:01,080
Like someone saying, “They did it!”

496
00:22:59,280 --> 00:23:01,610
Just leave it, don’t say any more.

497
00:23:01,610 --> 00:23:03,610
Then, pardon me, please watch it when it airs.

498
00:23:03,710 --> 00:23:06,010
It’s fine, just leave it.

499
00:23:06,220 --> 00:23:08,920
Why are you siding with them?

500
00:23:08,920 --> 00:23:13,760
Well, it was… The first time singing with the ocean behind me, and it was kinda refreshing.

501
00:23:13,760 --> 00:23:16,060
Really though, Ueda, something’s wrong with you.

502
00:23:16,060 --> 00:23:17,930
With me?!

503
00:23:16,960 --> 00:23:18,960
Yeah.

504
00:23:17,930 --> 00:23:20,230
He’s the host, the host. It’s fine.

505
00:23:20,230 --> 00:23:24,740
I mean, this show is going to keep continuing and all.

506
00:23:24,740 --> 00:23:28,070
I don’t think we’ll be back on this show again.

507
00:23:28,070 --> 00:23:31,510
I really doubt that’s the actual reasoning.
