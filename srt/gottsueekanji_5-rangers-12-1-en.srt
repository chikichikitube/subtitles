The Future Century
Squadron: The Five Rangai!

2
00:00:06,000 --> 00:00:08,300
His wife called me.

3
00:00:08,600 --> 00:00:11,640
What? I thought you
guys had broken up.

4
00:00:11,640 --> 00:00:17,000
We had. But she found out
about us and went crazy.

5
00:00:17,240 --> 00:00:21,560
What a bitch. It's her fault
that he went for another woman.

6
00:00:21,560 --> 00:00:24,880
Yeah. But she knows
something... Yes.

7
00:00:25,920 --> 00:00:27,420
Evening.

8
00:00:29,340 --> 00:00:31,240
Hi.

9
00:00:34,320 --> 00:00:39,640
Ryoko-chan, I heard that
**(bleeped) gave you a hard time.

10
00:00:41,920 --> 00:00:45,300
It's not easy
to be a singer.

11
00:00:46,080 --> 00:00:48,080
You should kick their asses.

12
00:00:48,080 --> 00:00:52,300
They're just jealous.
Because they are on the wane.

13
00:00:54,340 --> 00:00:55,660
What?
- They are here.

14
00:00:55,880 --> 00:00:59,920
I'm just saying no one as right
to be mean to someone with future.

15
00:00:59,920 --> 00:01:01,460
You can talk to me if you
are in trouble, OK?

16
00:01:01,460 --> 00:01:03,460
They are calling...
- Can't you wait?

17
00:01:04,520 --> 00:01:06,480
Heeelp!

18
00:01:06,480 --> 00:01:08,000
Stop!

19
00:01:10,400 --> 00:01:12,560
Akira Fire!
(from another sketch)

20
00:01:14,980 --> 00:01:17,180
Na-me Neko!
(delinquent young cat)

21
00:01:19,340 --> 00:01:21,840
Gachapin!
(character in kids show)

22
00:01:31,380 --> 00:01:34,140
Pieman!
(also from another sketch)

23
00:01:35,360 --> 00:01:38,620
Snake Police Officer!
(character from their early work)

24
00:01:39,300 --> 00:01:40,880
Our powers combined!

25
00:01:40,940 --> 00:01:42,340
The Five Rangai!

26
00:01:43,060 --> 00:01:46,520
Ladies, run. Now.
- Thank you.

27
00:01:49,060 --> 00:01:50,900
Stop!

28
00:01:51,300 --> 00:01:53,200
You bring back memories.

29
00:01:54,060 --> 00:01:56,260
It's like 5 years ago.

30
00:01:57,100 --> 00:01:58,260
Wait.

31
00:02:03,660 --> 00:02:05,440
Why are you in
those costumes?

32
00:02:05,440 --> 00:02:08,140
One of us is really creepy.

33
00:02:09,000 --> 00:02:10,800
You too bring back old days.

34
00:02:10,800 --> 00:02:12,120
Long time.

35
00:02:13,140 --> 00:02:14,980
They saved that costume?

36
00:02:15,280 --> 00:02:18,340
They send it all the way
from Tokyo Tower.

37
00:02:19,260 --> 00:02:20,900
What the hell
do you think...

38
00:02:22,600 --> 00:02:25,720
You hardly look like
a team!

39
00:02:26,160 --> 00:02:29,460
Don't you remember what you said?
- What did I say?

40
00:02:29,460 --> 00:02:32,780
You said we have to
appeal to kids.

41
00:02:33,060 --> 00:02:35,540
How could he appeal to kids?

42
00:02:37,040 --> 00:02:38,880
How could he?

43
00:02:39,140 --> 00:02:41,860
He does. Don't you see?

44
00:02:50,480 --> 00:02:51,740
This isn't working.

45
00:02:51,740 --> 00:02:53,800
Why?

46
00:02:55,720 --> 00:03:02,680
Yes, you have to appeal kids.
But you have to look like heroes.

47
00:03:02,960 --> 00:03:04,680
I'm sorry.
But you have to fight.

48
00:03:04,680 --> 00:03:06,900
Please.
- No.

49
00:03:11,040 --> 00:03:12,300
Don't shoot.

50
00:03:14,580 --> 00:03:16,580
I'm a wicked cute little snake.

51
00:03:21,460 --> 00:03:24,580
You don't move like
you did in old days.

52
00:03:25,060 --> 00:03:29,400
My ribs. Some of my ribs are missing.
- Don't give me BS.

53
00:03:30,300 --> 00:03:32,560
We can't fight.
- Why?

54
00:03:32,560 --> 00:03:35,960
Because you are
absolutely not 5 Rangai.

55
00:03:35,960 --> 00:03:38,400
I don't give a damn
about 5 Rangai.

56
00:03:39,580 --> 00:03:41,420
I said my some of
my ribs are missing.

57
00:03:42,080 --> 00:03:45,920
If I say one thing you only do that
and fail all other things.

58
00:03:45,920 --> 00:03:47,240
You wanna die?

59
00:03:48,620 --> 00:03:49,720
Hey!

60
00:03:50,660 --> 00:03:51,720
Hey!

61
00:03:56,320 --> 00:03:59,700
It's... this is not my idea.

62
00:04:02,740 --> 00:04:04,540
So who's idea is this?
- His.

63
00:04:10,680 --> 00:04:12,000
Is this your idea?

64
00:04:14,140 --> 00:04:16,380
Look. He's stepped back.

65
00:04:24,660 --> 00:04:26,280
You don't resist.

66
00:04:28,300 --> 00:04:30,560
We got it.
Forget about fighting.

67
00:04:31,480 --> 00:04:35,140
But what you said wasn't
exactly clear. - Why?

68
00:04:35,140 --> 00:04:39,400
We thought very hard how to
appeal to kids. - I understand that.

69
00:04:39,400 --> 00:04:42,800
But don't forget that you are heroes.
That's rule number one!

70
00:04:42,800 --> 00:04:44,800
So what do you want us
to do?

71
00:04:47,600 --> 00:04:50,600
Just get something
that will make you look like heroes.

72
00:04:50,780 --> 00:04:52,720
If we don't look like it
it's your fault.

73
00:04:52,800 --> 00:04:54,460
Who do you think
you are speaking to!

74
00:04:54,460 --> 00:04:55,500
That's his words.

75
00:04:58,520 --> 00:05:01,460
Just tell me what you want!
- Cool costumes!

76
00:05:01,460 --> 00:05:04,460
Cool costumes so that kids want
to be like you.

77
00:05:05,700 --> 00:05:07,880
I got it.
- Really?

78
00:05:08,420 --> 00:05:09,800
Finally.

79
00:05:11,020 --> 00:05:11,940
It will work.

80
00:05:12,080 --> 00:05:15,920
Make them want
to be like you.

81
00:05:16,980 --> 00:05:18,780
I have an idea.
Just for me.

82
00:05:19,260 --> 00:05:22,260
Just for you? - Yes.
So it's up to the other guys.

83
00:05:22,500 --> 00:05:24,960
I got it too.
- You do?

84
00:05:24,960 --> 00:05:28,300
That's what I've been talking about
from the start. - Thank you.

85
00:05:28,300 --> 00:05:30,100
Make a clean start.

86
00:05:30,100 --> 00:05:31,580
See you next week.

87
00:05:31,580 --> 00:05:34,820
Make them want to be
like you. - Ok.

88
00:05:34,960 --> 00:05:36,560
Nobody want to be like
you now.

89
00:05:36,680 --> 00:05:38,940
We may be little late next week.
- No!

90
00:05:39,580 --> 00:05:41,920
You come here on time!
- We will.

91
00:05:42,360 --> 00:05:43,740
I'm busy.

92
00:05:44,440 --> 00:05:46,540
Goodbye.

93
00:05:47,740 --> 00:05:49,960
I'll do it.
- Ok.

94
00:05:57,020 --> 00:06:02,500
The Future Century Squadron: The Five Rangai!   To be con't.
