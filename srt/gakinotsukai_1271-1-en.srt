1
00:00:00,480 --> 00:00:05,250
1st Time on Gaki no Tsukai ya Arrahende
"I'm the One Who Understands you Best!"

2
00:00:05,670 --> 00:00:09,190
"Anyways, I Think You'll Like this Item!!"

3
00:00:12,520 --> 00:00:13,530
So Matsumoto-san.

4
00:00:13,530 --> 00:00:17,460
Well, I can't say I dislike this segment but

5
00:00:17,460 --> 00:00:21,800
I think it'd be better if we replaced Tanaka.

6
00:00:24,140 --> 00:00:25,400
Every time Tanaka!

7
00:00:26,470 --> 00:00:34,010
A special series on Gaki, where the members buy gifts for guests based on their interests!!

8
00:00:35,350 --> 00:00:38,020
This time, who could the guest be!?

9
00:00:38,050 --> 00:00:41,290
This time, I'm actually pretty confident.

10
00:00:41,290 --> 00:00:47,430
This is before I was married, but I did spend some time with him outside of work.

11
00:00:47,430 --> 00:00:48,590
Ah, with today's guest?

12
00:00:48,200 --> 00:00:48,590
Yes

13
00:00:48,590 --> 00:00:50,530
I'm gonna take it this time!!

14
00:00:50,000 --> 00:00:51,260
Downtown-san

15
00:00:51,260 --> 00:00:53,300
You see each other quite often.

16
00:00:53,580 --> 00:00:54,670
Whilst we do see him

17
00:00:54,670 --> 00:00:57,070
it's usually on set.

18
00:00:57,070 --> 00:00:58,470
When we see him on set, he's always basking in the wind.

19
00:00:58,470 --> 00:01:02,740
When we see him on set, he's always basking in the wind.

20
00:01:02,080 --> 00:01:04,480
Let's welcome today's guest in!

21
00:01:15,650 --> 00:01:19,460
There's the wind I was talking about.

22
00:01:16,620 --> 00:01:20,430
Nishikawa Takanori

23
00:01:19,460 --> 00:01:21,460
Even today, this wind is blowing.

24
00:01:22,330 --> 00:01:23,700
Wow!!

25
00:01:24,720 --> 00:01:27,570
He's really got the wind at his feet.

26
00:01:26,980 --> 00:01:28,330
That's so cool!

27
00:01:30,670 --> 00:01:34,910
Have you learnt how to manifest wind?

28
00:01:34,140 --> 00:01:36,740
I have, I flew over.

29
00:01:36,940 --> 00:01:38,980
No one even called me.

30
00:01:39,640 --> 00:01:42,410
Did you just invite yourself onto the show?

31
00:01:42,550 --> 00:01:43,950
Because of that stupid fan, I had to arrive 3 hours early!!

32
00:01:43,950 --> 00:01:46,990
Because of that stupid fan, I had to arrive 3 hours early!!

33
00:01:47,820 --> 00:01:53,730
An artist with a huge following, T.M. Revolution Nishikawa Takanori.

34
00:01:54,390 --> 00:02:00,400
The Gaki members will have to present a top and an accessory they think will suit him!!

35
00:02:00,770 --> 00:02:03,370
How would you describe yourself as far as fashion goes?

36
00:02:03,370 --> 00:02:05,900
Like are you very specific about a certain style.

37
00:02:05,640 --> 00:02:08,040
I see what you mean

38
00:02:08,040 --> 00:02:09,910
well, this year I'm 45.

39
00:02:09,910 --> 00:02:11,710
45 really?!

40
00:02:10,610 --> 00:02:11,710
Yes

41
00:02:11,710 --> 00:02:13,710
So...

42
00:02:12,310 --> 00:02:15,710
I thought you were around 11.

43
00:02:15,710 --> 00:02:17,650
It's been a while since we've seen each other

44
00:02:17,650 --> 00:02:19,020
but I was over 20 when we met for the first time.

45
00:02:19,020 --> 00:02:20,850
but I was over 20 when we met for the first time.

46
00:02:21,120 --> 00:02:25,960
What's really important to me is a sense of freshness.

47
00:02:25,120 --> 00:02:25,760
Freshness?

48
00:02:25,760 --> 00:02:27,230
Freshness?

49
00:02:28,330 --> 00:02:31,530
I need to dress in an unoffensive way.

50
00:02:32,800 --> 00:02:34,770
What sort of clothes do you wear casually?

51
00:02:34,870 --> 00:02:35,500
It's gotta be futuristic!!

52
00:02:35,500 --> 00:02:37,600
It's gotta be futuristic!!

53
00:02:37,600 --> 00:02:39,100
Just one thing

54
00:02:39,100 --> 00:02:42,210
normally we get the guest's sizes given to us.

55
00:02:42,210 --> 00:02:43,780
How come we didn't this time?!

56
00:02:43,780 --> 00:02:46,750
I had to guess what Nishikawa-kun's size was!!

57
00:02:46,940 --> 00:02:47,610
So I just thought of what size Pepper-kun would wear.

58
00:02:47,610 --> 00:02:50,050
So I just thought of what size Pepper-kun would wear.

59
00:02:53,550 --> 00:02:57,620
Before the show started, the Gaki members went shopping.

60
00:02:57,960 --> 00:03:01,030
Harajuku

61
00:02:58,520 --> 00:03:01,030
In search of a top, Hamada heads to Harajuku.

62
00:03:01,390 --> 00:03:03,030
This is Nishikawa.

63
00:03:03,730 --> 00:03:05,900
I feel really out of place in here.

64
00:03:05,900 --> 00:03:07,870
I feel really out of place in here.

65
00:03:08,230 --> 00:03:09,470
A leather jacket, hmm...

66
00:03:09,470 --> 00:03:11,470
A leather jacket, hmm...

67
00:03:12,600 --> 00:03:14,140
Staff

68
00:03:12,600 --> 00:03:16,070
What kind of image are you thinking?

69
00:03:14,140 --> 00:03:16,070
Wouldn't something a bit flashier be good?

70
00:03:16,440 --> 00:03:18,340
Something like this?

71
00:03:20,960 --> 00:03:21,910
This?

72
00:03:25,520 --> 00:03:29,350
I wonder if he'd wear something this flashy.

73
00:03:29,790 --> 00:03:30,490
Maybe something unexpected like this would work.

74
00:03:30,490 --> 00:03:33,590
Maybe something unexpected like this would work.

75
00:03:33,760 --> 00:03:35,590
Doesn't this look good?

76
00:03:35,660 --> 00:03:36,260
You'll like this sort of stuff right?

77
00:03:36,260 --> 00:03:37,260
You'll like this sort of stuff right?

78
00:03:37,260 --> 00:03:39,600
You'll like this sort of stuff right?

79
00:03:39,930 --> 00:03:43,940
Shibuya

80
00:03:40,260 --> 00:03:43,940
Tanaka is in Shibuya searching for an accessory.

81
00:03:44,170 --> 00:03:46,710
Nishikawa-san, I think a cap would suit his image.

82
00:03:46,710 --> 00:03:49,410
Nishikawa-san, I think a cap would suit his image.

83
00:03:49,410 --> 00:03:52,710
Have you ever seen him wearing one?

84
00:03:49,410 --> 00:03:52,710
Staff

85
00:03:50,680 --> 00:03:52,710
When I think about it...

86
00:03:52,710 --> 00:03:54,510
No!!

87
00:03:54,550 --> 00:03:57,980
I really think a cap has such a big impact as an accessory.

88
00:03:59,620 --> 00:04:02,450
I definitely want one of these.

89
00:04:04,660 --> 00:04:06,560
These look good.

90
00:04:06,720 --> 00:04:11,360
Maybe this one. It's definitely one of these.

91
00:04:11,730 --> 00:04:13,870
My only concern is, is this too cute?

92
00:04:13,870 --> 00:04:17,040
My only concern is, is this too cute?

93
00:04:17,300 --> 00:04:18,200
Let's go for it!

94
00:04:18,200 --> 00:04:21,510
Tanaka picks out his cute hat, how will it fare!?

95
00:04:21,870 --> 00:04:25,980
Takeshita Street

96
00:04:22,410 --> 00:04:25,980
Meanwhile, Hōsei visits the bustling Takeshita Street.

97
00:04:27,010 --> 00:04:31,050
Worrying about being recognised, he dons the perfect disguise.

98
00:04:31,880 --> 00:04:33,690
Luckily for me

99
00:04:33,690 --> 00:04:36,450
I worked with Nishikawa-kun only a month ago, so I've got a good idea of what to go for.

100
00:04:36,450 --> 00:04:39,320
I worked with Nishikawa-kun only a month ago, so I've got a good idea of what to go for.

101
00:04:39,990 --> 00:04:44,130
With his disguise on, he has no trouble getting to his destination.

102
00:04:44,240 --> 00:04:47,070
Even before going in, I can see a bunch of stuff that's good.

103
00:04:48,130 --> 00:04:52,940
In this narrow store, filled with unique outfits

104
00:04:52,940 --> 00:04:55,770
surely able to find something great, Hōsei is...

105
00:05:05,850 --> 00:05:10,190
Forgetting about time, he tries on items that take his fancy one after another.

106
00:05:12,320 --> 00:05:15,790
Staff

107
00:05:12,320 --> 00:05:15,790
You remember you're searching for casual clothes for Nishikawa-san...

108
00:05:16,130 --> 00:05:20,530
Marunouchi

109
00:05:16,590 --> 00:05:20,530
Endō, searching for an accessory heads to a certain store.

110
00:05:21,530 --> 00:05:23,340
Man, I don't know.

111
00:05:23,840 --> 00:05:27,210
Endō choses a totally unexpected item.

112
00:05:27,540 --> 00:05:31,210
Harajuku

113
00:05:27,710 --> 00:05:29,640
Meanwhile Matsumoto is...

114
00:05:29,640 --> 00:05:31,210
Good afternoon.

115
00:05:32,680 --> 00:05:34,080
I see.

116
00:05:36,510 --> 00:05:39,480
I don't like this.

117
00:05:39,480 --> 00:05:41,550
But he would wear this!!

118
00:05:42,220 --> 00:05:44,960
Which of the 3 colours looks better?

119
00:05:46,490 --> 00:05:50,030
The black is cheaper than the red!!

120
00:05:50,030 --> 00:05:51,700
I wonder why.

121
00:05:51,700 --> 00:05:52,830
NTV wants to lower production costs...

122
00:05:52,830 --> 00:05:57,140
NTV wants to lower production costs...

123
00:05:57,140 --> 00:05:59,340
The cheaper the better, even if it's only 1,000 yen!!

124
00:06:00,140 --> 00:06:04,340
Everyone is trying their best to select a great item, how will they do?

125
00:06:04,640 --> 00:06:08,250
Nishikawa-kun will take home his favourite item

126
00:06:08,250 --> 00:06:10,780
and the worst will have to pay themselves.

127
00:06:11,150 --> 00:06:13,490
Just as always.

128
00:06:13,890 --> 00:06:15,220
Yamasaki-san, today have you come as Watanabe Tōru?

129
00:06:15,220 --> 00:06:18,420
Yamasaki-san, today have you come as Watanabe Tōru?

130
00:06:23,360 --> 00:06:27,400
First, let's take a look at what tops the Gaki members selected for Nishikawa Takanori.

131
00:06:28,500 --> 00:06:32,900
The ever confident Tanaka is first up, how will he do?

132
00:06:32,900 --> 00:06:35,610
'You really chose this?'

133
00:06:35,610 --> 00:06:38,340
I'm going places no one would ever think, that's how I'll get 1st!!

134
00:06:38,340 --> 00:06:39,740
I'm going places no one would ever think, that's how I'll get 1st!!

135
00:06:39,980 --> 00:06:41,740
Of course!

136
00:06:42,480 --> 00:06:45,020
The worst thing is to leave a potential winner behind.

137
00:06:45,550 --> 00:06:48,320
Please take a look at this.

138
00:06:49,220 --> 00:06:50,390
Nishikawa-kun

139
00:06:50,390 --> 00:06:51,660
Don't let any friendships hold back your true feelings.

140
00:06:51,660 --> 00:06:53,790
Don't let any friendships hold back your true feelings.

141
00:06:53,930 --> 00:06:55,790
This is from Shibuya right?

142
00:06:55,460 --> 00:06:56,590
This isn't good.

143
00:06:56,590 --> 00:06:58,860
This sucks.

144
00:06:57,130 --> 00:06:59,500
His face looks a bit...

145
00:07:00,030 --> 00:07:07,540
(£67/$102)

146
00:07:00,030 --> 00:07:07,540
Price conversions are approximate for time of airing.

147
00:07:04,270 --> 00:07:05,070
Look closely

148
00:07:06,090 --> 00:07:07,070
It's double-breasted.

149
00:07:07,740 --> 00:07:11,580
It looks more like his stage clothing.

150
00:07:09,770 --> 00:07:10,740
The double-breasted?

151
00:07:11,580 --> 00:07:14,910
Not at all!!

152
00:07:14,910 --> 00:07:17,320
It isn't even his image.

153
00:07:15,710 --> 00:07:18,420
That's because it isn't!!

154
00:07:17,530 --> 00:07:19,980
It looks like a school uniform.

155
00:07:20,990 --> 00:07:22,020
Double's are really fashionable right now.

156
00:07:22,020 --> 00:07:23,760
Double's are really fashionable right now.

157
00:07:24,610 --> 00:07:27,860
To be honest, Nishikawa-san does look pretty cool in it.

158
00:07:27,230 --> 00:07:28,790
It really does suit him, right?

159
00:07:31,560 --> 00:07:32,530
Don't you think this completes the outfit?

160
00:07:32,530 --> 00:07:34,430
Don't you think this completes the outfit?

161
00:07:34,530 --> 00:07:36,840
The pants, the shoes?

162
00:07:36,840 --> 00:07:37,870
The size is right.

163
00:07:37,870 --> 00:07:40,640
Is this for Shichi-Go-San?

164
00:07:37,870 --> 00:07:49,380
Shichi-Go-San (lit. 7-5-3) is a festival day held on 15th Nov for 3 and 7 year old girls, 5 year old and sometimes 3 year old boys, to celebrate the well-being of young children

165
00:07:40,640 --> 00:07:41,270
Who just said Shichi-Go-San?

166
00:07:41,270 --> 00:07:43,240
Who just said Shichi-Go-San?

167
00:07:43,240 --> 00:07:45,240
It's for Shichi-Go-San right?

168
00:07:46,380 --> 00:07:49,380
Do you have some sort of problem with me?

169
00:07:55,390 --> 00:08:00,890
Subbed by Inepped

170
00:07:55,390 --> 00:08:00,890
This is a free fansub
Please support the official release

171
00:08:02,030 --> 00:08:05,900
Gaki members are presenting items they think will suit our guest.

172
00:08:06,830 --> 00:08:11,400
Hamada is next to present his top to our guest Nishikawa Takanori.

173
00:08:11,490 --> 00:08:12,440
Hamada-san

174
00:08:12,440 --> 00:08:14,170
When it comes to Nishikawa-kun

175
00:08:14,440 --> 00:08:16,410
I've only really seen...

176
00:08:16,410 --> 00:08:18,540
I haven't seen him in his casual clothing very often.

177
00:08:18,540 --> 00:08:20,080
I haven't seen him in his casual clothing very often.

178
00:08:21,010 --> 00:08:24,720
We've gone out to eat a few times...

179
00:08:24,130 --> 00:08:24,720
This is bad...

180
00:08:25,680 --> 00:08:27,020
This is so bad!

181
00:08:27,920 --> 00:08:29,050
This is so so bad!!

182
00:08:29,420 --> 00:08:34,230
(£148/$225)

183
00:08:31,020 --> 00:08:32,960
It's not bad.

184
00:08:32,960 --> 00:08:34,230
It's a crow man.

185
00:08:34,460 --> 00:08:36,360
I also saw one with a tiger pattern but

186
00:08:36,360 --> 00:08:38,300
I didn't think that was the right image.

187
00:08:38,460 --> 00:08:40,430
That's well avoided.

188
00:08:42,830 --> 00:08:47,270
It might not be work great with a shirt, it'll go better with a t-shirt.

189
00:08:47,270 --> 00:08:48,410
You don't understand T.M. at all.

190
00:08:48,410 --> 00:08:51,310
You don't understand T.M. at all.

191
00:08:51,310 --> 00:08:53,750
It probably doesn't go with the pants you've got on but...

192
00:08:53,750 --> 00:08:55,380
The colour matches.

193
00:08:54,480 --> 00:08:55,680
No way!

194
00:08:55,880 --> 00:08:57,680
I think this was the way to go.

195
00:08:57,680 --> 00:08:59,780
I feel sorry for T.M.

196
00:09:03,250 --> 00:09:06,120
I saw other things on the shelf, but picked out this.

197
00:09:07,260 --> 00:09:10,600
We can't see the shelves, so who cares.

198
00:09:11,560 --> 00:09:16,100
Next to present his top, Endō.

199
00:09:16,180 --> 00:09:18,000
I'm really...

200
00:09:18,000 --> 00:09:19,040
I'm really sorry.

201
00:09:19,040 --> 00:09:20,510
These two weren't aggressive enough with their picks.

202
00:09:20,510 --> 00:09:22,340
These two weren't aggressive enough with their picks.

203
00:09:25,480 --> 00:09:27,250
You wear various styles and are super fashionable.

204
00:09:27,250 --> 00:09:29,350
You wear various styles and are super fashionable.

205
00:09:29,350 --> 00:09:32,550
I think you'll like this sort of thing the most.

206
00:09:34,690 --> 00:09:36,050
It's a parka.

207
00:09:36,350 --> 00:09:38,760
I'm totally into this!!

208
00:09:38,890 --> 00:09:41,840
I was looking for something with a tiger or leopard pattern

209
00:09:39,090 --> 00:09:45,900
(£38/$57)

210
00:09:41,840 --> 00:09:45,300
but I saw this, with the tiger's maw right in the middle.

211
00:09:46,260 --> 00:09:47,500
Are you...

212
00:09:47,500 --> 00:09:52,370
Dainoji!?

213
00:09:47,500 --> 00:09:57,180
Ōchi "Dainoji" Yosuke is part of the comedic duo "Dainoji"
and two-time World Air Guitar Champion.

214
00:09:52,370 --> 00:09:53,770
Ōchi and Nishikawa-kun are poles apart!!

215
00:09:53,770 --> 00:09:57,180
Ōchi and Nishikawa-kun are poles apart!!

216
00:09:57,180 --> 00:09:59,140
Kuroyanagi-sa~n is something I don't think I've ever said.

217
00:09:57,180 --> 00:10:03,150
Likely referencing a skit by Ōchi, in it he keeps yelling to a Kuroyanagi-san

218
00:09:59,140 --> 00:10:03,150
Kuroyanagi-sa~n is something I don't think I've ever said.

219
00:10:03,280 --> 00:10:06,180
You can see him showing up to recording in this.

220
00:10:06,850 --> 00:10:09,890
The size is way off too!!

221
00:10:09,890 --> 00:10:10,760
It's pointless being a zip-up, if it's open you can't see the tiger.

222
00:10:10,760 --> 00:10:13,260
It's pointless being a zip-up, if it's open you can't see the tiger.

223
00:10:13,260 --> 00:10:15,960
Problem is, it gets worse when it's zipped up!!

224
00:10:15,960 --> 00:10:17,560
Looks good!

225
00:10:17,560 --> 00:10:19,430
Stop messing around!

226
00:10:19,430 --> 00:10:21,330
Endō, this is awful!!

227
00:10:20,630 --> 00:10:21,500
Really?!

228
00:10:21,500 --> 00:10:24,140
The expression says it all!!

229
00:10:24,400 --> 00:10:26,040
Rather than the tiger, I'm looking at his distraught face!!

230
00:10:26,040 --> 00:10:29,170
Rather than the tiger, I'm looking at his distraught face!!

231
00:10:30,170 --> 00:10:34,680
Next up Hōsei shows off a surprising top.

232
00:10:34,680 --> 00:10:37,920
Well, last place has already been decided.

233
00:10:38,480 --> 00:10:41,350
I feel nice and relaxed now.

234
00:10:40,420 --> 00:10:41,350
Nishikawa-kun

235
00:10:41,350 --> 00:10:43,350
You mentioned earlier that there was something important to you

236
00:10:43,350 --> 00:10:45,090
You mentioned earlier that there was something important to you

237
00:10:45,090 --> 00:10:45,590
Nishikawa-kun, what did you say?

238
00:10:45,590 --> 00:10:47,990
Nishikawa-kun, what did you say?

239
00:10:48,060 --> 00:10:51,930
Freshness

240
00:10:48,690 --> 00:10:49,290
Freshness

241
00:10:49,290 --> 00:10:51,930
and after that comes ROCK.

242
00:10:53,200 --> 00:10:53,900
Yeah

243
00:10:55,030 --> 00:10:58,770
I kept thinking about that ROCK feeling and

244
00:10:58,770 --> 00:11:00,870
found something to complete your look.

245
00:11:00,870 --> 00:11:03,170
As soon as he opened the bag, his face went pale.

246
00:11:06,610 --> 00:11:08,310
This is just awful!!

247
00:11:08,880 --> 00:11:10,880
Hōsei-san, are you serious?!

248
00:11:10,880 --> 00:11:13,220
You guys are just messing around.

249
00:11:13,550 --> 00:11:20,890
(£59/$89)

250
00:11:19,490 --> 00:11:21,330
That looks great!

251
00:11:23,290 --> 00:11:26,160
Takamizawa Toshihiko is a Japanese singer-songwriter

252
00:11:23,290 --> 00:11:26,160
You've become Takamizawa!!

253
00:11:27,630 --> 00:11:28,870
It's fine if you want to tuck it into your pants as well.

254
00:11:28,870 --> 00:11:31,870
It's fine if you want to tuck it into your pants as well.

255
00:11:31,870 --> 00:11:34,210
It'll even work with jeans.

256
00:11:34,210 --> 00:11:35,270
This much? You expect me to tuck all of this into my jeans!?

257
00:11:35,270 --> 00:11:39,740
This much? You expect me to tuck all of this into my jeans!?

258
00:11:40,750 --> 00:11:45,250
To round off the tops' segment, last up is Matsumoto.

259
00:11:45,250 --> 00:11:46,920
Look at that

260
00:11:46,920 --> 00:11:49,590
the lengths don't match up.

261
00:11:49,590 --> 00:11:50,820
Who would wear such a long jacket?

262
00:11:50,820 --> 00:11:53,260
Who would wear such a long jacket?

263
00:11:53,830 --> 00:11:54,690
I want to finish this, these guys are just messing around!!

264
00:11:54,690 --> 00:11:58,330
I want to finish this, these guys are just messing around!!

265
00:12:00,870 --> 00:12:03,530
I just want to make them laugh!!

266
00:12:03,530 --> 00:12:06,670
You can't be thinking like that!!

267
00:12:09,610 --> 00:12:11,710
When you think of it, Nishikawa-kun truly has the heart of a musician.

268
00:12:11,710 --> 00:12:14,310
When you think of it, Nishikawa-kun truly has the heart of a musician.

269
00:12:14,310 --> 00:12:18,720
Musician's usually say "I like this kind of thing"

270
00:12:18,720 --> 00:12:22,850
If it were for me, I wouldn't have picked this out.

271
00:12:23,920 --> 00:12:25,390
Oh

272
00:12:25,390 --> 00:12:26,790
You hear that? He just went "Oh".

273
00:12:26,790 --> 00:12:30,160
You hear that? He just went "Oh".

274
00:12:30,500 --> 00:12:32,260
It's a stage costume!!

275
00:12:35,330 --> 00:12:36,930
Did you hear it? The "Oh"?

276
00:12:36,930 --> 00:12:40,270
Did you hear it? The "Oh"?

277
00:12:40,270 --> 00:12:42,070
Play it again! Play it again! Audio-san!!

278
00:12:42,070 --> 00:12:43,910
Play it again! Play it again! Audio-san!!

279
00:12:43,910 --> 00:12:45,480
Nobody heard it.

280
00:12:45,480 --> 00:12:48,210
This works great with a long sleaved shirt.

281
00:12:46,240 --> 00:12:55,220
(£52/$79)

282
00:12:48,210 --> 00:12:50,110
It may look like a costume but...

283
00:12:50,110 --> 00:12:51,620
You could totally wear this to Yudetaro!!

284
00:12:50,110 --> 00:12:55,220
Yudetaro is a Japanese noodle restaurant chain

285
00:12:51,620 --> 00:12:55,220
You could totally wear this to Yudetaro!!

286
00:12:55,220 --> 00:12:56,150
Of all the places to pick from.

287
00:12:56,150 --> 00:12:57,420
Of all the places to pick from.

288
00:12:57,420 --> 00:12:58,260
I'm old so I can't think of anywhere else

289
00:12:58,260 --> 00:13:00,560
I'm old so I can't think of anywhere else

290
00:13:01,330 --> 00:13:02,730
Just get some udon or soba!!

291
00:13:02,730 --> 00:13:04,860
Just get some udon or soba!!

292
00:13:06,900 --> 00:13:10,870
Which of these will be Nishikawa's favourite top!?

293
00:13:10,920 --> 00:13:12,500
So, Nishikawa-kun

294
00:13:12,500 --> 00:13:14,410
in first place is...?

295
00:13:14,670 --> 00:13:18,140
Endō

296
00:13:14,670 --> 00:13:18,140
Hamada

297
00:13:14,670 --> 00:13:18,140
Hōsei

298
00:13:14,670 --> 00:13:18,140
Matsumoto

299
00:13:14,670 --> 00:13:18,140
Tanaka

300
00:13:14,840 --> 00:13:17,110
It's...

301
00:13:17,110 --> 00:13:17,680
...this one

302
00:13:17,680 --> 00:13:18,740
No way!!

303
00:13:17,840 --> 00:13:18,740
YES!!

304
00:13:19,310 --> 00:13:20,550
You're joking!!

305
00:13:20,380 --> 00:13:21,210
YES!!

306
00:13:21,750 --> 00:13:22,650
YES!!

307
00:13:22,880 --> 00:13:23,410
YES!!

308
00:13:24,180 --> 00:13:25,180
YES!!

309
00:13:25,420 --> 00:13:26,320
YES!!

310
00:13:26,320 --> 00:13:29,050
SHUT UP!!

311
00:13:29,050 --> 00:13:30,620
Nishikawa-san...

312
00:13:29,850 --> 00:13:31,760
Please tell us your reasoning.

313
00:13:31,780 --> 00:13:34,390
A lot of my work's clothes are black and dark colours.

314
00:13:34,390 --> 00:13:37,330
So I like something a little lighter for casual stuff.

315
00:13:37,330 --> 00:13:39,600
Navy blue is a nice middle ground.

316
00:13:40,460 --> 00:13:43,470
The gold buttons really make it though right?

317
00:13:42,330 --> 00:13:44,800
They're actually a point against it.

318
00:13:45,200 --> 00:13:45,800
You're just saying that 'cos yours have got 'em too.

319
00:13:45,800 --> 00:13:48,110
You're just saying that 'cos yours have got 'em too.

320
00:13:49,410 --> 00:13:53,210
They look completely different!!

321
00:13:54,440 --> 00:13:59,050
In second place is Hamada's top.

322
00:13:59,960 --> 00:14:03,450
And third is Matsumoto's.

323
00:14:02,690 --> 00:14:05,390
In truth, this should have been first.

324
00:14:05,390 --> 00:14:07,060
Nah, it's not first material.

325
00:14:05,890 --> 00:14:07,460
Third, third, third.

326
00:14:07,060 --> 00:14:08,360
Why is this third?

327
00:14:08,690 --> 00:14:09,660
To be honest, I don't usually choose things this plain.

328
00:14:09,660 --> 00:14:12,230
To be honest, I don't usually choose things this plain.

329
00:14:12,230 --> 00:14:13,600
To be honest, I don't usually choose things this plain.

330
00:14:13,660 --> 00:14:16,130
Then

331
00:14:16,130 --> 00:14:19,670
When you opened the bag, why did you go "Oh"?

332
00:14:19,670 --> 00:14:20,170
Eh? This? It was more like that.

333
00:14:20,170 --> 00:14:20,640
Eh? This? It was more like that.

334
00:14:20,640 --> 00:14:23,140
Eh? This? It was more like that.

335
00:14:25,610 --> 00:14:29,610
So, which of these tops will come in last!?

336
00:14:29,680 --> 00:14:31,250
I still think mine looks good.

337
00:14:31,250 --> 00:14:34,190
Remember how lame the tiger print looks.

338
00:14:31,950 --> 00:14:35,520
Endō

339
00:14:31,950 --> 00:14:35,520
Hōsei

340
00:14:34,190 --> 00:14:36,550
So Nishikawa-kun...

341
00:14:36,550 --> 00:14:38,550
in last place is...?

342
00:14:38,590 --> 00:14:40,560
Endō

343
00:14:38,590 --> 00:14:40,560
Hōsei

344
00:14:39,920 --> 00:14:40,550
This

345
00:14:45,500 --> 00:14:46,700
Of course it is!

346
00:14:47,770 --> 00:14:48,830
This one wasn't even close!!

347
00:14:48,830 --> 00:14:50,870
This one wasn't even close!!

348
00:14:50,870 --> 00:14:54,110
It makes you angry right?

349
00:14:52,340 --> 00:14:54,110
It really does.

350
00:14:54,310 --> 00:14:57,480
The shop clerk was wearing it.

351
00:14:57,480 --> 00:14:58,480
The clerk was wearing 'this'?

352
00:14:58,480 --> 00:15:01,210
The clerk was wearing 'this'?

353
00:15:00,310 --> 00:15:01,210
It's true.

354
00:15:01,950 --> 00:15:05,420
Hōsei has to pay for his poor choice!! (£59/$89)

355
00:15:05,420 --> 00:15:06,650
Make sure you pay the horseshoe crab in full.

356
00:15:06,650 --> 00:15:10,220
Make sure you pay the horseshoe crab in full.

357
00:15:07,820 --> 00:15:10,220
Nakamura Yoshinobu

358
00:15:07,820 --> 00:15:10,220
Producer

359
00:15:10,690 --> 00:15:12,260
When someone calls you a horseshoe crab, look at the camera!!

360
00:15:12,260 --> 00:15:15,990
When someone calls you a horseshoe crab, look at the camera!!

361
00:15:16,730 --> 00:15:20,500
Coming up next, finding an accessory to suit Nishikawa Takanori.

362
00:15:21,530 --> 00:15:26,000
First up to take the challenge, Hamada.

363
00:15:26,070 --> 00:15:27,740
I feel like this guy

364
00:15:27,740 --> 00:15:31,040
just picks up the first thing he sees.

365
00:15:29,540 --> 00:15:31,050
That one definitely wasn't.

366
00:15:31,050 --> 00:15:32,810
But this one, to be honest

367
00:15:32,810 --> 00:15:36,380
it was kinda the first thing.

368
00:15:35,380 --> 00:15:37,750
Ah, there it is!!

369
00:15:37,750 --> 00:15:40,750
Well, it's all about thinking 'what would they want?'

370
00:15:40,750 --> 00:15:44,190
If the person you're buying for likes it, what does it matter.

371
00:15:46,660 --> 00:15:52,000
(£149/$227)

372
00:15:47,120 --> 00:15:47,990
I see

373
00:15:48,230 --> 00:15:50,360
The all white works quite well.

374
00:15:50,360 --> 00:15:52,000
Yeah, they'll go with anything.

375
00:15:52,090 --> 00:15:54,470
I think, when you're relaxing

376
00:15:54,470 --> 00:15:56,430
isn't it pretty uncomfortable
to be wearing shoes with such a high lift.

377
00:15:56,430 --> 00:15:59,640
isn't it pretty uncomfortable
to be wearing shoes with such a high lift.

378
00:15:59,740 --> 00:16:03,270
I mean, they're not exactly for relaxing in, they're smart casual.

379
00:16:03,270 --> 00:16:04,440
You can't go to Yudetaro in those!!

380
00:16:04,440 --> 00:16:06,310
You can't go to Yudetaro in those!!

381
00:16:06,310 --> 00:16:09,250
Stop using Yudetaro as your standard!!

382
00:16:10,250 --> 00:16:14,750
Next up, the loser from the last round, it's Hōsei.

383
00:16:15,290 --> 00:16:18,460
I really think Nishikawa-kun will...

384
00:16:19,020 --> 00:16:20,560
Just a sec, before I open this.

385
00:16:20,620 --> 00:16:23,060
This is from the same place.

386
00:16:24,660 --> 00:16:25,630
Zipang Group.

387
00:16:28,270 --> 00:16:29,970
This is ROCK styled.

388
00:16:29,970 --> 00:16:32,400
This can be worn with almost anything, anywhere.

389
00:16:32,400 --> 00:16:35,240
This can be worn with almost anything, anywhere.

390
00:16:39,110 --> 00:16:42,050
Who would want that!!

391
00:16:42,050 --> 00:16:44,050
What's up with you today?

392
00:16:42,410 --> 00:16:48,720
(£24/$36)

393
00:16:45,680 --> 00:16:48,720
Could I just take it off you, I'll put it on you.

394
00:16:48,870 --> 00:16:50,190
What?

395
00:16:50,550 --> 00:16:52,190
What is it?

396
00:16:52,920 --> 00:16:54,630
What is that?

397
00:16:55,130 --> 00:16:56,630
What is that?

398
00:16:56,630 --> 00:16:59,330
I don't even know what to call it.

399
00:16:59,380 --> 00:17:01,330
The name, it's that...

400
00:17:01,830 --> 00:17:05,740
It's that...

401
00:17:02,700 --> 00:17:05,740
shar

402
00:17:03,300 --> 00:17:05,740
sharp

403
00:17:03,830 --> 00:17:05,740
cover.

404
00:17:07,940 --> 00:17:12,110
You're as sharp as ever!!

405
00:17:13,080 --> 00:17:17,620
Next up, Tanaka presents his cap.

406
00:17:19,150 --> 00:17:21,320
Ah

407
00:17:20,050 --> 00:17:21,320
Eh? A hat?

408
00:17:21,320 --> 00:17:23,790
As soon as he saw it, I heard an "Ah".

409
00:17:21,650 --> 00:17:27,460
(£32/$49)

410
00:17:24,050 --> 00:17:26,960
We heard the same thing from Matsumoto-san.

411
00:17:26,000 --> 00:17:27,890
It's totally different from that one.

412
00:17:27,890 --> 00:17:29,290
This was an 'Ah'.

413
00:17:29,290 --> 00:17:30,800
Snoopy?

414
00:17:30,800 --> 00:17:32,130
I don't think you guys know

415
00:17:32,130 --> 00:17:34,400
that he can be cute as well as cool.

416
00:17:35,030 --> 00:17:36,930
You guys didn't know that, right?

417
00:17:36,930 --> 00:17:38,400
I did.

418
00:17:38,400 --> 00:17:39,270
Would someone who knew, buy something like that?

419
00:17:39,270 --> 00:17:41,840
Would someone who knew, buy something like that?

420
00:17:43,840 --> 00:17:46,510
It's not bad but, I think you should be more aggressive.

421
00:17:46,510 --> 00:17:48,210
Snoopy suits 45 year olds quite well.

422
00:17:48,210 --> 00:17:51,020
Snoopy suits 45 year olds quite well.

423
00:17:51,020 --> 00:17:53,350
Wouldn't it suit us all?

424
00:17:57,250 --> 00:17:59,490
I wear this stuff all the time.

425
00:18:03,430 --> 00:18:06,460
I wear this stuff all the time!!

426
00:18:06,460 --> 00:18:08,630
I wear this stuff all the time!!

427
00:18:08,630 --> 00:18:10,570
I wear this stuff all the time!!

428
00:18:10,570 --> 00:18:11,970
Not to be annoying or anything, but I wear this stuff all the time!!

429
00:18:11,970 --> 00:18:16,040
Not to be annoying or anything, but I wear this stuff all the time!!

430
00:18:17,090 --> 00:18:21,550
Next, what item has Endō selected?

431
00:18:21,640 --> 00:18:22,680
This is maybe something you wouldn't buy yourself but...

432
00:18:22,680 --> 00:18:25,520
This is maybe something you wouldn't buy yourself but...

433
00:18:25,120 --> 00:18:25,520
I see.

434
00:18:25,520 --> 00:18:27,420
Shoes and hats you'd buy for yourself

435
00:18:27,420 --> 00:18:30,090
Shoes and hats you'd buy for yourself

436
00:18:30,750 --> 00:18:32,260
This is something you probably wouldn't buy for yourself, but I think will suit Nishikawa-san perfectly.

437
00:18:32,260 --> 00:18:34,060
This is something you probably wouldn't buy for yourself, but I think will suit Nishikawa-san perfectly.

438
00:18:34,060 --> 00:18:37,130
This is something you probably wouldn't buy for yourself, but I think will suit Nishikawa-san perfectly.

439
00:18:38,100 --> 00:18:40,000
He's getting the excuses out early.

440
00:18:40,200 --> 00:18:41,630
What is it?

441
00:18:41,630 --> 00:18:42,300
A cane?

442
00:18:42,470 --> 00:18:44,070
It's a stylish stick.

443
00:18:44,070 --> 00:18:45,370
Who's that on top?

444
00:18:44,400 --> 00:18:49,710
(£96/$145)

445
00:18:45,370 --> 00:18:46,740
It's Beethoven.

446
00:18:51,940 --> 00:18:55,010
I'm saved!!

447
00:18:55,450 --> 00:19:00,080
What would you have thought if Nishikawa-kun walked out with that earlier?

448
00:19:01,890 --> 00:19:02,950
All of a sudden, I feel more like Uchida Yūya.

449
00:19:02,950 --> 00:19:06,360
All of a sudden, I feel more like Uchida Yūya.

450
00:19:02,950 --> 00:19:07,660
Uchida Yūya, November 17, 1939 – March 17, 2019) was a Japanese singer, record producer, and actor.

451
00:19:07,860 --> 00:19:09,960
This is supposed to be casual stuff!!

452
00:19:12,030 --> 00:19:14,400
What are you supposed to do with this at Yudetaro!!

453
00:19:15,270 --> 00:19:17,500
I can point to what I want!

454
00:19:17,500 --> 00:19:18,840
This and this.

455
00:19:20,520 --> 00:19:23,840
"I Think You'll Like this Item!"

456
00:19:24,680 --> 00:19:29,310
Will Matsumoto present something Nishikawa will like?

457
00:19:30,180 --> 00:19:32,520
I'm also attacking with this one too.

458
00:19:32,650 --> 00:19:33,620
It's tiny.

459
00:19:33,980 --> 00:19:35,990
No pranks.

460
00:19:39,060 --> 00:19:41,230
I can't stand to see the pranks of mid-level comedians!!

461
00:19:41,230 --> 00:19:44,900
I can't stand to see the pranks of mid-level comedians!!

462
00:19:45,060 --> 00:19:49,470
I think, Nishikawa-kun needs a necktie.

463
00:19:52,440 --> 00:19:58,940
(£11/$17)

464
00:19:53,640 --> 00:19:55,310
This is...

465
00:19:55,310 --> 00:19:59,540
This is a loop butterfly tie, which is a combination of a bolo and bow tie.

466
00:19:59,540 --> 00:20:02,610
Since it's a bow tie

467
00:20:02,610 --> 00:20:04,320
Even if you're just wearing a T-shirt, you'll look stylish.

468
00:20:04,320 --> 00:20:07,520
Even if you're just wearing a T-shirt, you'll look stylish.

469
00:20:07,520 --> 00:20:08,050
Why are you saying all this with a half-smile?

470
00:20:08,050 --> 00:20:10,960
Why are you saying all this with a half-smile?

471
00:20:10,960 --> 00:20:13,320
We're you thinking of me...

472
00:20:13,320 --> 00:20:14,660
When I was at the store, I thought it looked great.

473
00:20:14,660 --> 00:20:17,360
When I was at the store, I thought it looked great.

474
00:20:17,360 --> 00:20:19,730
Then when you took it out of the bag...

475
00:20:19,730 --> 00:20:22,470
Seeing it up close, under the bright lights...

476
00:20:22,470 --> 00:20:27,040
I thought 'WOW'

477
00:20:27,400 --> 00:20:29,870
There's still Yama-chan and Endō's, so I'm not sure whether this will come in last.

478
00:20:29,870 --> 00:20:32,340
There's still Yama-chan and Endō's, so I'm not sure whether this will come in last.

479
00:20:32,980 --> 00:20:34,650
What d'you think?

480
00:20:36,750 --> 00:20:38,880
Loop butterfly tie

481
00:20:39,480 --> 00:20:40,580
It'll be the number one search term once this airs!!

482
00:20:40,580 --> 00:20:43,320
It'll be the number one search term once this airs!!

483
00:20:46,960 --> 00:20:49,090
Where are you guys looking?

484
00:20:49,090 --> 00:20:49,860
They're all completely avoiding eye contact.

485
00:20:49,860 --> 00:20:53,600
They're all completely avoiding eye contact.

486
00:20:55,800 --> 00:20:59,600
Which of these will be Nishikawa's favourite item!?

487
00:20:59,840 --> 00:21:02,740
Nishikawa-kun, you've favourite item is...?

488
00:21:02,740 --> 00:21:05,380
Endō

489
00:21:02,740 --> 00:21:05,380
Hamada

490
00:21:02,740 --> 00:21:05,380
Hōsei

491
00:21:02,740 --> 00:21:05,380
Matsumoto

492
00:21:02,740 --> 00:21:05,380
Tanaka

493
00:21:03,540 --> 00:21:05,410
Surprisingly, it's these.

494
00:21:05,040 --> 00:21:06,940
Thank you very much.

495
00:21:11,490 --> 00:21:15,320
After all, white is quite easy to match with

496
00:21:15,320 --> 00:21:20,390
Whilst I don't really wear this stuff all that often, I still like these.

497
00:21:20,390 --> 00:21:22,260
This is just wrong.

498
00:21:22,260 --> 00:21:24,430
The staff must be so angry with this.

499
00:21:23,660 --> 00:21:24,760
Why?

500
00:21:24,430 --> 00:21:25,900
This one being the favourite.

501
00:21:25,900 --> 00:21:27,970
The guest himself likes it.

502
00:21:28,970 --> 00:21:33,000
And in second place is Tanaka's cap.

503
00:21:35,810 --> 00:21:37,880
Well, I could guess up 'til here.

504
00:21:37,880 --> 00:21:40,680
Yep, we all knew.

505
00:21:40,680 --> 00:21:44,820
From here on, it's the battle for the real number one!!

506
00:21:45,280 --> 00:21:46,620
Well said! Very wise!!

507
00:21:46,620 --> 00:21:50,790
Well said! Very wise!!

508
00:21:49,790 --> 00:21:51,720
Third place is actually first place.

509
00:21:51,720 --> 00:21:54,890
All of that stuff is just useless.

510
00:21:54,890 --> 00:21:55,490
Hamada-san, this is for the true first place.

511
00:21:55,490 --> 00:21:56,530
Hamada-san, this is for the true first place.

512
00:21:56,530 --> 00:22:01,930
Hamada-san, this is for the true first place.

513
00:21:58,230 --> 00:22:01,930
Something's wrong with you.

514
00:22:02,970 --> 00:22:07,440
An accessory that Nishikawa likes. Who will win third place!?

515
00:22:07,440 --> 00:22:10,040
This is crucial!!

516
00:22:10,040 --> 00:22:12,340
Endō

517
00:22:10,040 --> 00:22:12,340
Hōsei

518
00:22:10,040 --> 00:22:12,340
Matsumoto

519
00:22:11,000 --> 00:22:12,910
It's unexpectedly this.

520
00:22:15,180 --> 00:22:16,480
Thank you very much.

521
00:22:15,680 --> 00:22:16,750
The reason?

522
00:22:16,750 --> 00:22:20,550
It would look pretty strange if you weren't in formal clothes

523
00:22:20,550 --> 00:22:26,360
But, in the right setting, I'd like to try this out.

524
00:22:26,720 --> 00:22:28,290
Thank you very much.

525
00:22:28,290 --> 00:22:29,860
I certainly wouldn't rush back if I forgot this somewhere.

526
00:22:29,860 --> 00:22:33,830
I certainly wouldn't rush back if I forgot this somewhere.

527
00:22:32,000 --> 00:22:33,000
Like in a taxi?

528
00:22:34,000 --> 00:22:35,800
If I forgot it in your taxi, I wouldn't bother contacting you.

529
00:22:35,800 --> 00:22:37,800
If I forgot it in your taxi, I wouldn't bother contacting you.

530
00:22:38,900 --> 00:22:40,100
I wouldn't go looking for it!!

531
00:22:40,100 --> 00:22:42,070
I wouldn't go looking for it!!

532
00:22:42,550 --> 00:22:47,750
Which of these will come in last place!?

533
00:22:48,780 --> 00:22:53,250
Which of these items does Nishikawa dislike the most!?

534
00:22:53,680 --> 00:22:54,990
You don't seem to like the neck area too much.

535
00:22:54,990 --> 00:22:57,990
You don't seem to like the neck area too much.

536
00:22:59,260 --> 00:23:01,390
T.M.'s just not in that mode at the moment.

537
00:23:01,390 --> 00:23:04,030
T.M.'s just not in that mode at the moment.

538
00:23:02,330 --> 00:23:05,660
If this were tomorrow, there might be a different result.

539
00:23:04,030 --> 00:23:08,200
He's just not thinking about the neck area right now.

540
00:23:08,330 --> 00:23:10,400
So, let's go Nishikawa-kun...

541
00:23:09,070 --> 00:23:11,440
Please take a good look.

542
00:23:10,530 --> 00:23:12,370
In last place is...?

543
00:23:13,700 --> 00:23:15,140
Please take a closer look.

544
00:23:16,840 --> 00:23:18,380
TOO QUICK!!

545
00:23:19,000 --> 00:23:21,010
Nishikawa-kun, too quick!!

546
00:23:20,080 --> 00:23:21,810
It's gotta be that, right?

547
00:23:23,180 --> 00:23:24,580
I think this'd be impossible for anyone to wear!!

548
00:23:24,580 --> 00:23:26,920
I think this'd be impossible for anyone to wear!!

549
00:23:26,920 --> 00:23:28,520
When I put it on, it gave me chills!!

550
00:23:28,520 --> 00:23:31,960
When I put it on, it gave me chills!!

551
00:23:32,960 --> 00:23:36,060
Hōsei once again has to pay the price for his failure!! (£24/$36)

552
00:23:36,120 --> 00:23:39,000
I'm sorry that Yama-chan was just joking around.

553
00:23:39,000 --> 00:23:40,000
That's not true.

554
00:23:40,000 --> 00:23:42,000
Please call me again.

555
00:23:42,000 --> 00:23:44,170
Do you want revenge or something?

556
00:23:44,170 --> 00:23:46,700
Maybe, with a burdock root or something.

557
00:23:46,700 --> 00:23:48,770
Something I can hit you with.

558
00:23:49,610 --> 00:23:51,540
I guess that's how you'd feel.

559
00:23:52,480 --> 00:23:53,580
Terrible!!

560
00:23:54,170 --> 00:23:55,110
It was terrible.

561
00:23:55,110 --> 00:23:59,450
That was awful but even worse was the shirt.

562
00:23:59,450 --> 00:24:01,120
I truly hated that!

563
00:24:02,020 --> 00:24:03,890
I truly hated it!

564
00:24:04,920 --> 00:24:08,090
I think you were just playing around.
