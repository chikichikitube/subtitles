2
00:00:00,980 --> 00:00:05,350
Well, let's hear today's final request.

3
00:00:05,350 --> 00:00:10,020
Next up, Yasutomi Seiji-san, 42-years-old, from Osaka Prefecture.

4
00:00:10,020 --> 00:00:12,220
A request from a self-employed person.

5
00:00:12,220 --> 00:00:15,930
"In the room of my junior from our motorcycle group,

6
00:00:15,930 --> 00:00:19,200
we've discovered a peculiar object."

7
00:00:19,200 --> 00:00:22,870
"That is, hidden inside his bath unit's bathtub,

8
00:00:22,870 --> 00:00:25,500
there's a photo album-like object."

9
00:00:25,500 --> 00:00:28,040
"Perhaps the previous tenant hid it there, or

10
00:00:28,040 --> 00:00:30,410
they forget it. We don't know, but

11
00:00:30,410 --> 00:00:33,250
it's definitely hidden in a place where it can't be removed."

12
00:00:33,250 --> 00:00:34,050
I see.

13
00:00:34,050 --> 00:00:36,180
"Why was it hidden in this place?

14
00:00:36,180 --> 00:00:39,180
Are these photos that they don't want to be seen, no matter what?

15
00:00:39,180 --> 00:00:41,620
The mystery continues to deepen."

16
00:00:41,620 --> 00:00:45,190
"In order to get this album out, would you lend me your skills?"

17
00:00:45,190 --> 00:00:47,860
"Thank you very much." That's the request.

18
00:00:47,860 --> 00:00:53,370
Didn't you think "Where is inside his bath unit's bathtub?"

19
00:00:53,370 --> 00:00:56,170
This won't come out, no matter what they do.

20
00:00:56,170 --> 00:00:57,840
They want to try to get it out.

21
00:00:57,840 --> 00:01:00,840
That's really scary, isn't it?

22
00:00:59,000 --> 00:01:00,840
This is really mysterious, huh.

23
00:01:00,840 --> 00:01:03,780
That's right. That's why the request has come in.

24
00:01:03,780 --> 00:01:05,850
Did we get the album out without incident?

25
00:01:05,850 --> 00:01:08,150
Please take a look.

26
00:01:06,810 --> 00:01:08,150
Right, why won't it come out?

27
00:01:09,350 --> 00:01:12,250
Here? Ah!

28
00:01:12,250 --> 00:01:14,920
So thin!

29
00:01:14,920 --> 00:01:17,820
It's the last line piece in Tetris.

30
00:01:18,410 --> 00:01:19,100
Ah!

31
00:01:19,100 --> 00:01:22,030
Hello.

32
00:01:19,680 --> 00:01:22,030
Hello.

33
00:01:22,030 --> 00:01:23,360
Eh? Yasutomi...

34
00:01:23,360 --> 00:01:25,030
I'm Yasutomi.

35
00:01:23,920 --> 00:01:25,030
Ah, the client.

36
00:01:25,030 --> 00:01:26,990
And this is your junior?

37
00:01:26,050 --> 00:01:26,990
Yes.

38
00:01:26,990 --> 00:01:28,870
The person who lives here.

39
00:01:27,560 --> 00:01:28,870
Yes.

40
00:01:28,870 --> 00:01:32,870
You're holding the cat?

41
00:01:30,420 --> 00:01:32,870
Ah, so it doesn't get out.

42
00:01:32,870 --> 00:01:37,380
Inside the bath unit, there's an album?

43
00:01:37,380 --> 00:01:41,510
Does it count as inside? There's an inspection window.

44
00:01:41,510 --> 00:01:45,680
Inside of that window, there's an album.

45
00:01:45,680 --> 00:01:47,350
While he was inspecting it,

46
00:01:46,150 --> 00:01:50,790
The plumber tried to take it out, but...

47
00:01:47,350 --> 00:01:49,550
He said "Do you want me to remove it?"

48
00:01:49,550 --> 00:01:51,660
"No matter what I do, I can't get it out."

49
00:01:51,660 --> 00:01:55,860
It's smaller than the access panel.

50
00:01:55,860 --> 00:02:00,030
No, no, no. It was put in there, so...

51
00:01:58,040 --> 00:02:00,030
That's right.

52
00:02:00,030 --> 00:02:03,500
This is it.

53
00:02:01,200 --> 00:02:03,500
Eh!?

54
00:02:03,500 --> 00:02:07,710
It's here. This access panel.

55
00:02:06,320 --> 00:02:07,710
Oh!

56
00:02:07,710 --> 00:02:11,580
Wait a minute. Where is it inside here?

57
00:02:11,580 --> 00:02:14,280
Under this. It's under here.

58
00:02:20,490 --> 00:02:22,520
Ok, well, how about you take a look?

59
00:02:22,520 --> 00:02:25,390
Seriously? Seriously?

60
00:02:25,390 --> 00:02:29,860
Wait, wait a minute. This is really hard to do.

61
00:02:29,860 --> 00:02:32,730
Ah!

62
00:02:32,730 --> 00:02:34,500
This?

63
00:02:34,500 --> 00:02:37,200
This white thing?

64
00:02:35,290 --> 00:02:37,200
That's it.

65
00:02:39,170 --> 00:02:41,510
It's an album.

66
00:02:40,010 --> 00:02:41,510
That it is.

67
00:02:41,510 --> 00:02:43,940
That's definitely an album.

68
00:02:44,210 --> 00:02:46,510
Eh? It can't come out of here?

69
00:02:45,800 --> 00:02:46,510
It can't

70
00:02:46,510 --> 00:02:47,710
It can't come out.

71
00:02:47,710 --> 00:02:49,150
Give it a try.

72
00:02:51,920 --> 00:02:55,520
It's an album. Without a doubt, it's an album.

73
00:02:55,520 --> 00:02:58,590
It's coming out.

74
00:02:57,200 --> 00:02:58,590
It won't come out.

75
00:03:03,360 --> 00:03:05,200
Ah.

76
00:03:04,240 --> 00:03:05,200
It won't come out.

77
00:03:05,200 --> 00:03:06,860
That's right.

78
00:03:06,860 --> 00:03:10,700
Eh? I can't get it horizontal.

79
00:03:10,700 --> 00:03:12,670
Ah!

80
00:03:13,710 --> 00:03:15,510
Will it come out like this?

81
00:03:17,340 --> 00:03:19,240
Ah~

82
00:03:19,240 --> 00:03:23,480
Wow! It's really tricky to get out.

83
00:03:25,450 --> 00:03:27,320
It won't come out.

84
00:03:27,320 --> 00:03:30,490
Eh? You know what,

85
00:03:30,490 --> 00:03:34,790
it being hidden gives the impression of it being dirty, right?

86
00:03:31,820 --> 00:03:34,790
Dirty...

87
00:03:35,030 --> 00:03:39,560
If you think about it normally, they'd be photos you'd want to hide.

88
00:03:39,560 --> 00:03:42,070
Like photos of your adulterous lover.

89
00:03:42,070 --> 00:03:46,400
I also think this is a bit of a strange phenomenon.

90
00:03:45,450 --> 00:03:46,400
Eh?

91
00:03:46,400 --> 00:03:47,840
Another one appeared, right?

92
00:03:47,840 --> 00:03:50,340
That's right. There's another album since before.

93
00:03:48,690 --> 00:03:50,340
Another album appeared.

94
00:03:50,340 --> 00:03:51,480
Huh!?

95
00:03:51,480 --> 00:03:54,010
There's another one stuck in there.

96
00:03:54,010 --> 00:03:55,680
We thoroughly tried to get it. Really.

97
00:03:55,680 --> 00:03:59,050
When we were both looking...

98
00:03:55,950 --> 00:04:01,920
There's another album that wasn't there in the beginning...

99
00:03:57,680 --> 00:03:59,050
It definitely wasn't there?

100
00:03:59,050 --> 00:04:02,420
There was only the white one.

101
00:04:00,050 --> 00:04:02,420
Only the one we saw before.

102
00:04:02,420 --> 00:04:05,990
There's another one. I haven't seen that one yet.

103
00:04:05,990 --> 00:04:08,730
Wait a minute. That's scary, scary, scary, scary.

104
00:04:08,730 --> 00:04:11,560
Sorry, could you bring me my wallet?

105
00:04:13,370 --> 00:04:16,100
I want to taste some salt.

106
00:04:16,910 --> 00:04:20,440
I carry it around with me.

107
00:04:18,160 --> 00:04:20,440
It's amazing you have that on hand...

108
00:04:20,440 --> 00:04:22,740
That's suspicious!

109
00:04:24,380 --> 00:04:27,510
It's not good if you have a white powder in your wallet.

110
00:04:27,510 --> 00:04:30,480
Take this carefully, since it's salt.

111
00:04:31,020 --> 00:04:32,560
Salt, right?

112
00:04:32,560 --> 00:04:34,690
It's salt. Say it's salt!

113
00:04:34,690 --> 00:04:36,520
Say it's salt, seriously.

114
00:04:36,520 --> 00:04:38,990
It's really salt.

115
00:04:37,230 --> 00:04:38,990
It's really salt, right?

116
00:04:38,990 --> 00:04:42,260
Removing the albums.

117
00:04:43,660 --> 00:04:45,630
It's there.

118
00:04:48,030 --> 00:04:50,040
Ah...

119
00:04:52,270 --> 00:04:54,310
This is it.

120
00:04:54,310 --> 00:04:57,240
That's it. That's it.

121
00:04:54,970 --> 00:04:57,240
Wow, it's really there.

122
00:04:57,710 --> 00:04:59,210
Huh? What's written on it?

123
00:04:59,210 --> 00:05:02,410
Natural Album is written on it.

124
00:05:04,220 --> 00:05:05,980
How is it? Will it come out?

125
00:05:05,980 --> 00:05:10,490
No, it seems to be the same size.

126
00:05:11,720 --> 00:05:12,970
But that...

127
00:05:16,330 --> 00:05:17,730
This is useless.

128
00:05:17,730 --> 00:05:19,230
Can we break this up?

129
00:05:19,230 --> 00:05:21,070
Is that no good? You rent, right?

130
00:05:21,070 --> 00:05:23,670
I rent, so break it up is a bit...

131
00:05:23,670 --> 00:05:26,540
To take all of this out,

132
00:05:26,540 --> 00:05:28,940
it'll cost around $5,000 I'm told.

133
00:05:27,560 --> 00:05:28,940
Eh~?

134
00:05:28,940 --> 00:05:30,840
So, that's no good.

135
00:05:30,840 --> 00:05:35,950
We're already paying too much for the new director.

136
00:05:35,950 --> 00:05:39,850
How did it get there with this entrance?

137
00:05:39,850 --> 00:05:42,150
There's one there.

138
00:05:42,150 --> 00:05:46,390
And propped up is the one we first discovered.

139
00:05:47,190 --> 00:05:49,660
How did this get in there?

140
00:05:49,660 --> 00:05:52,480
There isn't anything like another access panel, right?

141
00:05:52,480 --> 00:05:55,730
Like behind the mirror?

142
00:05:54,000 --> 00:05:55,730
Isn't that really scary?

143
00:05:55,730 --> 00:05:58,400
Oh!

144
00:05:58,400 --> 00:06:00,400
Nothing.

145
00:06:01,770 --> 00:06:03,410
Nothing.

146
00:06:08,980 --> 00:06:10,640
This is?

147
00:06:10,640 --> 00:06:13,280
I haven't seen that before.

148
00:06:14,090 --> 00:06:17,220
Woah, it opens!

149
00:06:17,220 --> 00:06:19,690
Isn't that an attic, basically?

150
00:06:21,730 --> 00:06:23,830
What's going on?

151
00:06:34,740 --> 00:06:37,030
There's something.

152
00:06:37,030 --> 00:06:38,380
No way!?

153
00:06:38,380 --> 00:06:41,180
There's something. Wait.

154
00:06:39,080 --> 00:06:41,180
No way. What's there?

155
00:06:47,650 --> 00:06:50,860
A Christmas tree.

156
00:06:56,330 --> 00:06:58,470
What's this? You put it there?

157
00:06:58,470 --> 00:06:59,860
I didn't put it there.

158
00:06:59,860 --> 00:07:01,970
No! Scary, scary, scary!

159
00:07:08,640 --> 00:07:11,640
Wait a minute, what's going on here?

160
00:07:14,380 --> 00:07:18,450
I get it. I get it.

161
00:07:18,450 --> 00:07:23,350
From up here, it went down like that.

162
00:07:23,350 --> 00:07:25,690
Ah~

163
00:07:25,690 --> 00:07:30,060
And then it probably was up here.

164
00:07:29,300 --> 00:07:30,060
Hidden.

165
00:07:30,060 --> 00:07:30,530
Yeah.

166
00:07:30,530 --> 00:07:32,200
Then, an earthquake made it fall.

167
00:07:32,200 --> 00:07:37,540
An earthquake or something. We don't know, but something made it fall back there.

168
00:07:37,540 --> 00:07:40,510
So, we can get it out from here.

169
00:07:40,510 --> 00:07:41,970
Nakade-kun, give me a hand.

170
00:07:41,320 --> 00:07:41,970
Alright.

171
00:07:41,970 --> 00:07:43,340
Thanks.

172
00:07:43,680 --> 00:07:47,510
Rope fishing strategy.

173
00:07:45,440 --> 00:07:47,510
Umm, where about?

174
00:07:47,510 --> 00:07:49,680
Here goes.

175
00:07:48,440 --> 00:07:49,680
Okay.

176
00:07:51,580 --> 00:07:53,890
Got it.

177
00:07:52,560 --> 00:07:53,890
You've got it?

178
00:07:56,320 --> 00:07:57,480
Got it tied?

179
00:07:57,480 --> 00:07:59,200
It's a little cramped.

180
00:07:59,200 --> 00:08:00,060
Cramped?

181
00:08:01,930 --> 00:08:04,830
You can't see anything from up here.

182
00:08:06,430 --> 00:08:09,700
Try raising it now.

183
00:08:08,550 --> 00:08:09,700
Okay.

184
00:08:13,710 --> 00:08:17,000
Woah, it's really heavy.

185
00:08:17,000 --> 00:08:18,310
Is that so?

186
00:08:20,980 --> 00:08:24,550
I've got it! I've got it!

187
00:08:24,550 --> 00:08:25,480
I've got it!

188
00:08:25,480 --> 00:08:26,850
I have it!

189
00:08:28,620 --> 00:08:30,390
I'm holding it.

190
00:08:30,390 --> 00:08:32,920
The second album. The second one.

191
00:08:33,290 --> 00:08:34,590
Is it coming?

192
00:08:34,590 --> 00:08:35,760
Just a bit more.

193
00:08:35,760 --> 00:08:38,430
Ah! That startled me.

194
00:08:38,430 --> 00:08:40,870
That's startled me. My, oh my.

195
00:08:39,250 --> 00:08:40,870
Why are you surprised?

196
00:08:40,870 --> 00:08:42,650
You have "Natural"?

197
00:08:42,650 --> 00:08:46,300
Alright!

198
00:08:46,300 --> 00:08:48,450
Alright, we've got them.

199
00:08:48,450 --> 00:08:49,940
What now?

200
00:08:49,940 --> 00:08:51,380
If we could return them,

201
00:08:51,380 --> 00:08:52,540
that'd be a good thing.

202
00:08:52,540 --> 00:08:55,580
Looking for clues of the owner.

203
00:08:55,580 --> 00:08:56,910
Let's open it.

204
00:08:56,910 --> 00:08:59,380
Stand it up.

205
00:08:59,380 --> 00:09:02,890
Oh.

206
00:09:00,160 --> 00:09:02,890
Hmm.

207
00:09:02,890 --> 00:09:04,960
There's something written.

208
00:09:03,920 --> 00:09:04,960
Eh?

209
00:09:04,960 --> 00:09:07,910
"On the way to Himeji Nagusa Waterfall"

210
00:09:07,910 --> 00:09:10,160
"1995" is written.

211
00:09:10,160 --> 00:09:13,870
A woman and a man. A couple, huh.

212
00:09:12,650 --> 00:09:13,870
Probably so.

213
00:09:13,870 --> 00:09:19,040
1995 is 24 years ago.

214
00:09:17,920 --> 00:09:19,040
24 years ago.

215
00:09:19,040 --> 00:09:21,940
Ah~ it's this person.

216
00:09:21,940 --> 00:09:23,010
Do you know them?

217
00:09:23,010 --> 00:09:25,480
No, no.

218
00:09:25,480 --> 00:09:28,510
It's because this one's a close-up.

219
00:09:28,510 --> 00:09:31,050
This is a close-up. The guy was a little far away there.

220
00:09:31,050 --> 00:09:34,690
This is it.

221
00:09:34,690 --> 00:09:40,020
These two are our protagonists.

222
00:09:40,020 --> 00:09:43,030
They have a really good relationship.

223
00:09:43,030 --> 00:09:46,730
These two have been to various places together.

224
00:09:46,730 --> 00:09:49,970
Aw, they're so lovely.

225
00:09:49,970 --> 00:09:52,050
Ah, so that's how it is.

226
00:09:52,050 --> 00:09:52,870
They're kissing.

227
00:09:52,870 --> 00:09:54,640
On the cheek, on the check, right.

228
00:09:56,340 --> 00:10:01,410
This is a very nice album. Really.

229
00:10:02,180 --> 00:10:04,220
Is this here?

230
00:10:03,720 --> 00:10:04,220
Eh?

231
00:10:04,220 --> 00:10:06,350
It's here!

232
00:10:04,940 --> 00:10:06,350
It's here!

233
00:10:06,350 --> 00:10:07,650
Woah!

234
00:10:07,650 --> 00:10:09,520
It really is.

235
00:10:09,520 --> 00:10:11,620
I-i-it's here.

236
00:10:11,620 --> 00:10:15,330
This is that veranda.

237
00:10:15,330 --> 00:10:17,200
No doubt.

238
00:10:16,390 --> 00:10:17,200
No doubt.

239
00:10:18,660 --> 00:10:21,930
A name is written.

240
00:10:21,930 --> 00:10:24,540
Hiro-chan. Jun-chan.

241
00:10:24,540 --> 00:10:28,040
Wait, can we ask your landlord?

242
00:10:29,530 --> 00:10:30,710
Hello?

243
00:10:30,710 --> 00:10:31,980
Hello, excuse me.

244
00:10:31,980 --> 00:10:36,780
The people who lived in the apartment...

245
00:10:33,180 --> 00:10:38,180
Explaining the situation to the landlord.

246
00:10:38,180 --> 00:10:41,120
When I bought the old apartment, right?

247
00:10:41,120 --> 00:10:43,320
It must have been around 20 years ago now.

248
00:10:43,320 --> 00:10:45,090
Around 20 years?

249
00:10:45,090 --> 00:10:49,960
If they were a tenant since the time I bought it, I'd know.

250
00:10:49,960 --> 00:10:52,700
During that time, did a person named Hiroshi and

251
00:10:52,700 --> 00:10:56,370
a person named Jun live here?

252
00:10:56,370 --> 00:10:59,370
As far as I know, they did not.

253
00:10:59,370 --> 00:11:01,870
Not by that name.

254
00:11:00,870 --> 00:11:01,870
None?

255
00:11:01,870 --> 00:11:04,410
No one.

256
00:11:03,350 --> 00:11:04,410
Ah~

257
00:11:04,410 --> 00:11:07,350
Before you bought it, the previous owner

258
00:11:07,350 --> 00:11:10,320
do you know where they are?

259
00:11:10,750 --> 00:11:14,820
Calling the previous owner's workplace.

260
00:11:11,050 --> 00:11:13,650
I'm calling.

261
00:11:12,290 --> 00:11:13,650
Let's give it a shot.

262
00:11:16,020 --> 00:11:18,660
"This is SoftBank."

263
00:11:18,660 --> 00:11:23,530
"The phone number you have dialed is no longer in use."

264
00:11:23,530 --> 00:11:28,000
"Please check the number and call again."

265
00:11:28,000 --> 00:11:31,900
So, for as to why they went and hid it in that place,

266
00:11:31,900 --> 00:11:34,170
perhaps they broke up and

267
00:11:34,170 --> 00:11:38,340
a new girlfriend came along, so he hid this.

268
00:11:38,340 --> 00:11:40,380
He forgot it, then left.

269
00:11:40,380 --> 00:11:42,350
After that, it fell.

270
00:11:42,350 --> 00:11:44,180
Couldn't that be the case?

271
00:11:44,180 --> 00:11:45,920
How do I say this? Um...

272
00:11:45,920 --> 00:11:48,450
I'm glad it was a happy item.

273
00:11:47,500 --> 00:11:48,450
That's true.

274
00:11:48,450 --> 00:11:50,080
Are you going to keep it?

275
00:11:50,080 --> 00:11:52,690
Well, if I keep this...

276
00:11:51,390 --> 00:11:52,690
Eh~?

277
00:11:53,320 --> 00:11:54,930
It's not Hiro-chan, is it?

278
00:11:54,930 --> 00:11:57,860
Did he come for it?

279
00:11:57,860 --> 00:11:59,630
What's with that ending?

280
00:11:59,630 --> 00:12:01,230
What was that!?

281
00:12:01,230 --> 00:12:03,330
What was that ending?

282
00:12:03,330 --> 00:12:06,140
The doorbell rang, right?

283
00:12:04,550 --> 00:12:06,140
What's that face?

284
00:12:07,550 --> 00:12:09,710
It was the delivery man.

285
00:12:11,380 --> 00:12:15,350
We weren't able to contact them, so

286
00:12:15,350 --> 00:12:17,320
we don't know anything else.

287
00:12:17,320 --> 00:12:20,180
If they watch this, someone might say "that's me".

288
00:12:20,180 --> 00:12:24,560
That's right. So if they want to,

289
00:12:24,560 --> 00:12:28,990
the client's junior, Nakade-kun, is keeping it safe for them, so

290
00:12:29,500 --> 00:12:32,030
it'd be nice if they came to get it.

291
00:12:32,030 --> 00:12:34,370
Thank you very much.
