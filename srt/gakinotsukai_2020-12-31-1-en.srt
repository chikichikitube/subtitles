Announces to the men their challenge

39
00:01:09,880 --> 00:01:11,800
I was just using a bidet

40
00:01:11,800 --> 00:01:12,840
The weather's good

41
00:01:12,840 --> 00:01:13,540
The water was

42
00:01:13,600 --> 00:01:15,800
Colder than I expected it to be

43
00:01:15,800 --> 00:01:17,130
And for that reason I wanted to call it a day

44
00:01:17,130 --> 00:01:20,570
And for that reason I wanted to call it a day

45
00:01:19,040 --> 00:01:19,620
I see

46
00:01:20,570 --> 00:01:22,540
That would be crazy though, if you left because of that

47
00:01:22,540 --> 00:01:23,780
You can't just do that

48
00:01:23,940 --> 00:01:24,940
Guess I can't?

49
00:01:24,940 --> 00:01:27,810
They have this here again, this year

50
00:01:25,940 --> 00:01:27,810
I told them to change that

51
00:01:27,810 --> 00:01:31,180
Write it more politely

52
00:01:29,800 --> 00:01:31,180
Yeah, it totally...

53
00:01:31,180 --> 00:01:31,960
"Wait!!"

54
00:01:31,420 --> 00:01:32,680
That's two exclamation marks

55
00:01:33,140 --> 00:01:33,910
"Wait here," it says

56
00:01:33,920 --> 00:01:36,720
How rude

57
00:01:35,380 --> 00:01:37,680
So, space ourselves out with these

58
00:01:38,240 --> 00:01:41,080
Oh, right. We have that kinda stuff, geez

59
00:01:45,700 --> 00:01:46,800
Weather's good

60
00:01:47,140 --> 00:01:47,880
The weather is good

61
00:01:47,880 --> 00:01:49,380

62
00:01:49,610 --> 00:01:49,810

67
00:01:53,720 --> 00:01:54,240
Hey

68
00:01:54,800 --> 00:01:55,300
He has... brought something with him

69
00:01:55,300 --> 00:01:56,870
He has... brought something with him

70
00:01:56,870 --> 00:02:00,940
Downtown's Former Manager

71
00:01:56,870 --> 00:02:00,940
Fujiwara Hiroshi

72
00:01:57,900 --> 00:01:58,980
Yeah, he's brought something with him

73
00:01:59,180 --> 00:02:00,940
That's scary, that's scary

74
00:02:03,280 --> 00:02:04,200
Is it following him?

75
00:02:04,520 --> 00:02:07,160
It is... following him, yes

76
00:02:06,160 --> 00:02:09,140
Yes, yes. Something is running over here

77
00:02:07,220 --> 00:02:07,920
What are they? Insects?

78
00:02:07,920 --> 00:02:09,220
What are they? Insects?

79
00:02:09,880 --> 00:02:12,950
Dogs?

80
00:02:11,320 --> 00:02:12,600
Yeah, not insects

81
00:02:12,780 --> 00:02:13,660
Come come

82
00:02:12,960 --> 00:02:13,920

Good boy, good boy

87
00:02:18,590 --> 00:02:21,130
Their movements are realistic

88
00:02:21,130 --> 00:02:23,260
They're showing him affection

89
00:02:23,300 --> 00:02:24,340

They're really showing me affection, aren't they?

00:02:26,180 --> 00:02:27,280
They really are

93
00:02:28,340 --> 00:02:30,400
These are my pet robo dogs

94
00:02:29,900 --> 00:02:30,220
I see

95
00:02:30,390 --> 00:02:32,240
Their names are Hanamaru and Daikichi

96
00:02:32,270 --> 00:02:35,330
Fujiwara's beloved robo dogs

97
00:02:32,270 --> 00:02:35,330

00:02:35,940 --> 00:02:37,320

101
00:02:38,090 --> 00:02:40,410
Hanamaru! Daikichi!

102
00:02:38,280 --> 00:02:40,420

104
00:02:40,620 --> 00:02:41,320

They're Hanamaru and Daikichi

106
00:02:46,390 --> 00:02:48,560

107
00:02:46,820 --> 00:02:48,560
His mind isoverwhelmed with his lines

108
00:02:48,900 --> 00:02:50,200
Doesn't matter whichev...

109
00:02:50,200 --> 00:02:51,560
Yeah, that's...

110
00:02:51,760 --> 00:02:53,140
Whichever is fine

111
00:02:53,140 --> 00:02:54,220
These guys...

112
00:02:54,480 --> 00:02:55,160
Amazing

113
00:02:55,160 --> 00:02:57,340
Will never attack their own company

114
00:02:57,600 --> 00:03:04,510
Absolutely will not attack their own company

115
00:02:57,600 --> 00:03:04,510
Great feature of the robo dogs

116
00:02:57,600 --> 00:03:04,510
T/N: This refers to Matsumoto harshly criticizing Yoshimoto Agency (the company that employs the Gaki members) for a scandal in 2019.

117
00:02:59,120 --> 00:03:01,420
They're really obedient

118
00:03:00,360 --> 00:03:01,420
Don't say that

119
00:03:01,420 --> 00:03:04,000
Not like there's a person they'd attack, anyway

120
00:03:04,520 --> 00:03:05,600
In comparison

121
00:03:05,600 --> 00:03:06,380
You guys

122
00:03:07,210 --> 00:03:09,880
Especially Downtown!!

123
00:03:09,880 --> 00:03:13,550
Attacking your own company like that

124
00:03:11,240 --> 00:03:12,100
We didn't

125
00:03:11,860 --> 00:03:12,800
What an idiot

126
00:03:13,550 --> 00:03:15,420
We're not acting like a family at all!!

127
00:03:15,420 --> 00:03:19,520
That's for us to say!!

128
00:03:20,620 --> 00:03:21,460
Anyway

129
00:03:21,720 --> 00:03:25,860
What was the point of that!?

130
00:03:23,740 --> 00:03:25,400
... Daikichi are the cutest

131
00:03:27,500 --> 00:03:28,430
Their steps are so damn noisy

132
00:03:28,430 --> 00:03:30,530
Their steps are so damn noisy

133
00:03:32,070 --> 00:03:33,640
They will do whatever they're told!!

134
00:03:33,640 --> 00:03:36,200
Make them sit then

135
00:03:36,200 --> 00:03:37,820
If I throw this bone

136
00:03:36,200 --> 00:03:43,110
Great feature of the robo dogs

137
00:03:36,200 --> 00:03:43,110
They can fetch a bone

138
00:03:38,200 --> 00:03:38,860
They will fetch it

139
00:03:38,920 --> 00:03:39,200
For real

140
00:03:39,200 --> 00:03:39,940
For real!?

141
00:03:39,280 --> 00:03:39,940
No way

142
00:03:39,940 --> 00:03:40,640
Here we go

143
00:03:40,900 --> 00:03:41,500
All right

144
00:03:42,420 --> 00:03:43,720
Hanamaru, get it

145
00:03:43,880 --> 00:03:45,850
So that one is Hanamaru

146
00:03:45,820 --> 00:03:47,100
Ehh, amazing!

147
00:03:45,880 --> 00:03:46,960

Straight to...

It can't get it!!

151
00:03:52,360 --> 00:03:53,380
It didn't get it

152
00:03:53,380 --> 00:03:54,600
It only went there

153
00:03:55,020 --> 00:03:55,620
Only went there

154
00:03:56,320 --> 00:04:00,060
How hilarious

155
00:04:00,060 --> 00:04:02,040
So much set up for them to fetch and then they didn't. They know how to get laughs

156
00:04:02,030 --> 00:04:06,430
Great feature of the robo dogs

157
00:04:02,030 --> 00:04:06,430
They know how to get laughs

158
00:04:02,760 --> 00:04:04,660
They can't even fetch if they wanted to

159
00:04:05,600 --> 00:04:06,420
True true

160
00:04:06,800 --> 00:04:09,670

00:04:55,850 --> 00:04:57,450
No Laughing Grand Paupers

189
00:04:57,480 --> 00:04:59,650
You will become poor people and

190
00:04:57,580 --> 00:04:59,400
What's that?

191
00:04:59,650 --> 00:05:03,160
You will spend the next 24 hours in destitution

192
00:05:01,580 --> 00:05:02,440
No way

193
00:05:03,390 --> 00:05:05,690
If you laugh during that, of course you'll get spanked

194
00:05:06,030 --> 00:05:08,700
Right on your butts!!

195
00:05:08,700 --> 00:05:10,310
But one thing differs this year

196
00:05:10,300 --> 00:05:11,830
This year's stage is

197
00:05:11,830 --> 00:05:19,470
The most dazzling town in the world Las Vegas!!

198
00:05:14,280 --> 00:05:19,470
The most dazzling town in the world Las Vegas!!

199
00:05:15,180 --> 00:05:18,740
There are ways to get rich quick all over that city!

200
00:05:19,480 --> 00:05:23,220
If you gamble and win, then the American Dream won't remain a dream

201
00:05:23,440 --> 00:05:23,860
I see

202
00:05:23,880 --> 00:05:25,250
You have a chance to go from Grand Paupers to Grand Millionaires

203
00:05:25,250 --> 00:05:29,620
You have a chance to go from Grand Paupers to Grand Millionaires

204
00:05:27,040 --> 00:05:29,620
Aren't you excited?

205
00:05:29,620 --> 00:05:31,620
Then, let's get going

206
00:05:32,000 --> 00:05:35,160
Go to

207
00:05:32,000 --> 00:05:35,160
Go to

208
00:05:32,000 --> 00:05:39,860
T/N: "Go To" was Japan's campaign to help the economy and boost domestic tourism. However, it was suspended in December 2020 to January 2021 due to coronavirus.

211

212
00:05:39,880 --> 00:05:40,460
Oh, more coming

213
00:05:40,460 --> 00:05:41,300
More came out

214
00:05:41,800 --> 00:05:45,730
Dancers make an entrance

215
00:05:42,720 --> 00:05:43,460

Thank you!! Inoue baby! Kanda baby!

3118
00:07:47,620 --> 00:07:48,660
Splendid

3119
00:07:47,620 --> 00:07:48,660
Thank you!! Inoue baby! Kanda baby!

3120
00:07:49,380 --> 00:07:49,980
Let's go, then

3121
00:07:49,980 --> 00:07:50,600
Let us go

3122
00:07:51,980 --> 00:07:55,100
"Enjoy!!"

3123
00:07:52,980 --> 00:07:53,860
She said "enjoy?"

3124
00:07:54,040 --> 00:07:54,760
Thank you

3125
00:07:55,300 --> 00:07:57,470
What the hell

3126
00:07:55,540 --> 00:07:56,580
Goodbye

3127
00:07:57,520 --> 00:07:58,640
Amazing

3128
00:07:58,980 --> 00:08:00,180
It was wonderful

3129
00:07:59,700 --> 00:08:02,640
The dog is following us

3130
00:08:02,640 --> 00:08:05,910
We can hear them so loudly

3131
00:08:02,700 --> 00:08:05,120
Let's be careful

3132
00:08:05,120 --> 00:08:06,140
They're talking quite a lot

3133
00:08:06,140 --> 00:08:07,340
Yoshio

3134
00:08:06,560 --> 00:08:07,780
They do talk quite a lot

3135
00:08:07,340 --> 00:08:08,410
Sayaka

3136
00:08:08,940 --> 00:08:11,180
Will those two shut up?

3137
00:08:11,180 --> 00:08:12,740
That's how it is. Do you get it?

3138
00:08:13,680 --> 00:08:15,080
Is this why there was about a 15 minute delay?

3139
00:08:15,080 --> 00:08:20,120
Is this why there was about a 15 minute delay?

3140
00:08:17,740 --> 00:08:18,660
There was a little delay

3141
00:08:18,660 --> 00:08:19,620
There was, wasn't there

3142
00:08:20,500 --> 00:08:21,120
I see

3143
00:08:21,120 --> 00:08:21,540
Right

3144
00:08:21,540 --> 00:08:22,460
The rehearsal for this

3145
00:08:22,660 --> 00:08:24,860
The rehearsal had some issues...

3146
00:08:25,260 --> 00:08:32,770
They take on the challenge of 24 Hours casino life

3147
00:08:25,260 --> 00:08:32,770
While taking coronavirus countermeasures, aim to become Grand Millionaires

3148
00:08:32,780 --> 00:08:33,720
Before that

3149
00:08:33,960 --> 00:08:35,620
We're calling this Grand Paupers

3150
00:08:36,770 --> 00:08:39,070
And that's what you're wearing? Though if you ask me,

3151
00:08:39,070 --> 00:08:40,980
That's already pretty much like Grand Paupers

3152
00:08:41,180 --> 00:08:42,980
How rude

3153
00:08:42,980 --> 00:08:45,580
We've prepared some clothes for you. Go and change

3154
00:08:46,230 --> 00:08:49,650
They must dress appropriately

3155
00:08:46,230 --> 00:08:49,650
To become Grand Paupers

3156
00:08:46,780 --> 00:08:49,600
We have to turn into paupers?

3157
00:08:50,320 --> 00:08:50,960
I see

3158
00:08:50,960 --> 00:08:53,090
I have a bad feeling about this

3159
00:08:53,090 --> 00:08:56,290
I'm on the right-most side

3160
00:08:57,780 --> 00:08:59,680
You never know. They might open up from the other side

3161
00:09:01,730 --> 00:09:05,630
Why not just let it be Hamada

3162
00:09:04,560 --> 00:09:06,480
So Hamada's not on either end

3163
00:09:06,480 --> 00:09:07,560
That's right, that's right

3164
00:09:07,560 --> 00:09:08,740
What is that?

3165
00:09:09,940 --> 00:09:12,870
Is everyone ready?

3166
00:09:11,520 --> 00:09:12,700
Yes

3167
00:09:12,870 --> 00:09:14,420
This year, we're gonna go all at once

3168
00:09:14,420 --> 00:09:14,740
Really!?

3169
00:09:14,740 --> 00:09:15,060
Oh

3170
00:09:15,240 --> 00:09:17,980
Open!!

3171
00:09:24,780 --> 00:09:29,590
The usual bobbed hair wig

3172
00:09:25,020 --> 00:09:27,280
Enough with that already

3173
00:09:27,980 --> 00:09:29,480
Can't you go easy on us?

3174
00:09:29,590 --> 00:09:33,290
Since what month did you decide on that?

3175
00:09:33,290 --> 00:09:35,760
You ordered it around summertime?

3176
00:09:35,220 --> 00:09:35,800
No, no

3177
00:09:36,160 --> 00:09:37,970
I was about to wear the hat

3178
00:09:37,970 --> 00:09:39,170
But they took it away and they brought me this wig instead...

3179
00:09:39,170 --> 00:09:41,140
But they took it away and they brought me this wig instead...

3180
00:09:41,800 --> 00:09:44,540
You should just say "Hold up"

3181
00:09:42,000 --> 00:09:43,460
That's right

3182
00:09:44,620 --> 00:09:46,440
You always mention little stuff like that

3183
00:09:44,720 --> 00:09:46,440
Normally, one would say that

3184
00:09:47,680 --> 00:09:49,240
Heh

3185
00:09:49,240 --> 00:09:51,810
Why are you laughing!!

3186
00:09:52,940 --> 00:09:54,680
So that's how it is this year

3187
00:09:54,980 --> 00:09:56,100
How dirty!!

3188
00:09:56,100 --> 00:09:58,600
I thought everyone would be like this

3189
00:09:57,290 --> 00:10:01,820
Only Hosei is ragged for real

3190
00:09:58,600 --> 00:09:59,840
Yours are all clean

3191
00:09:59,860 --> 00:10:01,120
Yes, they're still clean

3192
00:10:01,190 --> 00:10:03,820
I asked about Hamada's wig but

3193
00:10:03,820 --> 00:10:06,890
You're a mess!!

3194
00:10:04,420 --> 00:10:05,030
Go ahead

3195
00:10:05,030 --> 00:10:06,890
It was prepared for me, I had no choice!

3196
00:10:07,440 --> 00:10:08,760
Our outfits aren't the worst

3197
00:10:08,760 --> 00:10:10,230
Yes you're right

3198
00:10:10,230 --> 00:10:11,310
Ours are still preferable

3199
00:10:11,310 --> 00:10:12,800
What's up with this?

3200
00:10:12,800 --> 00:10:14,200
It's so dirty!

3201
00:10:13,550 --> 00:10:15,470
That outfit is way too dirty!

3202
00:10:14,200 --> 00:10:16,140
It stinks too

3203
00:10:15,470 --> 00:10:16,140
It stinks?

3204
00:10:16,570 --> 00:10:18,300
Ah it stinks too

3205
00:10:17,450 --> 00:10:18,310
It stinks

3206
00:10:18,310 --> 00:10:19,710
You're all Grand Paupers, but

3207
00:10:19,710 --> 00:10:22,680
Do your best and aim to become wealthy in Las Vegas

3208
00:10:22,680 --> 00:10:31,890
No Laughing Rules

3209
00:10:23,720 --> 00:10:31,890
Absolutely Don't Laugh

3210
00:10:23,720 --> 00:10:31,890
While in Las Vegas

3211
00:10:24,140 --> 00:10:26,400
The rules are simple

3212
00:10:26,400 --> 00:10:30,700
While in Las Vegas, you are not allowed to laugh

3213
00:10:32,150 --> 00:10:35,190
Let's go to the bus stop

3214
00:10:32,970 --> 00:10:35,190
Geez

3215
00:10:33,640 --> 00:10:35,190
We're riding the bus?

3216
00:10:35,460 --> 00:10:36,590
Let's head to the bus stop

3217
00:10:35,860 --> 00:10:36,590
This year too?

3218
00:10:36,590 --> 00:10:43,380
If they get on the bus, laughter will not be forgiven

3219
00:10:37,060 --> 00:10:43,380
The start approaches,

3220
00:10:43,630 --> 00:10:46,400
Can you line up here?

3221
00:10:44,730 --> 00:10:45,110
Yeah

3222
00:10:45,110 --> 00:10:45,920
Got it

3223
00:10:47,550 --> 00:10:48,940
Hm? Could it be?

3224
00:10:49,750 --> 00:10:50,680
Is it coming?

3225
00:10:50,680 --> 00:10:52,570
You mean the bus?

3226
00:10:51,770 --> 00:10:52,570
Yeah

3227
00:10:52,570 --> 00:10:55,240
Ah, it's here!

3228
00:10:53,560 --> 00:10:55,240
Amazing

3229
00:10:53,560 --> 00:10:55,240
Wah it's here, it's here!

3230
00:10:55,240 --> 00:10:56,360
It's here this year too

3231
00:10:56,360 --> 00:10:57,780
Ah it's here it's here

3232
00:10:58,570 --> 00:11:00,280
What's written on it?

3233
00:11:01,350 --> 00:11:03,180
Mameto... Mameto Regency

3234
00:11:03,180 --> 00:11:05,250
Omamett Regency

3235
00:11:05,250 --> 00:11:07,820
We're going to a hotel

3236
00:11:07,820 --> 00:11:08,820
A hotel?

3237
00:11:08,820 --> 00:11:11,270
Las Vegas's strongest...

3238
00:11:11,270 --> 00:11:12,460
Hotel and Casino!

3239
00:11:14,230 --> 00:11:16,130
Interesting

3240
00:11:15,550 --> 00:11:16,130
Isn't it?

3241
00:11:17,770 --> 00:11:22,470
I don't get "the strongest" part

3242
00:11:19,900 --> 00:11:20,870
Yeah

3243
00:11:20,870 --> 00:11:22,470
Me either

3244
00:11:23,640 --> 00:11:28,960
Omamett Regency

3245
00:11:23,850 --> 00:11:27,920
Omamett Regency Hotel and Casino shuttle bus

3246
00:11:24,340 --> 00:11:28,980
Hotel and Casino

3247
00:11:29,790 --> 00:11:31,640
The King of Las Vegas casinos,

3248
00:11:31,630 --> 00:11:34,160
Heipo, whose portrait is drawn on the bus

3249
00:11:34,680 --> 00:11:37,490
That is headed for the hotel

3250
00:11:37,490 --> 00:11:39,720
Once you get on the bus the game starts

3251
00:11:39,720 --> 00:11:42,060
Guess we should hop on

3252
00:11:42,060 --> 00:11:45,330
Let's get on let's get on

3253
00:11:42,620 --> 00:11:44,290
Let's ride let's ride

3254
00:11:42,620 --> 00:11:44,290
Mhm

3255
00:11:42,620 --> 00:11:44,290
Yeah yeah

3256
00:11:45,780 --> 00:11:47,560
Here we go again!

3257
00:11:46,810 --> 00:11:51,770
GO TO LAS VEGAS 24H

3258
00:11:46,810 --> 00:11:51,770
No Laughing Grand Paupers

3259
00:11:47,810 --> 00:11:50,730
Yep

3260
00:11:52,030 --> 00:11:53,570
We're on the bus again

3261
00:11:53,570 --> 00:11:54,450

3265
00:12:00,360 --> 00:12:02,360
What's waiting up ahead?

3266
00:12:03,680 --> 00:12:07,650
To have a hotel with a casino...

3267
00:12:07,650 --> 00:12:09,650
In Japan no less

3268
00:12:09,650 --> 00:12:10,580
But you don't have any money right?

3269
00:12:10,580 --> 00:12:12,290
But you don't have any money right?

3270
00:12:12,290 --> 00:12:15,520

I got my house built so I have loans

3279
00:12:25,800 --> 00:12:28,770
How much do you pay back every month?

3280
00:12:28,770 --> 00:12:30,920
It's not a monthly payment

3281
00:12:30,240 --> 00:12:31,520
How much have you-

3282
00:12:30,920 --> 00:12:32,910
It's a pay-when-you-can method

You're paying back a good chunk

3287
00:12:48,960 --> 00:12:53,660
You're laughing a lot!!

3288
00:12:51,510 --> 00:12:53,270

3292
00:12:55,830 --> 00:12:58,850

You didn't wanna say it out right huh?

3299
00:13:11,940 --> 00:13:14,650
Yeah, like, isn't it a bit embarrassing?

3300
00:13:14,650 --> 00:13:17,550
Not at all, being able to pay back XXX,XXX yen a month

3301
00:13:17,550 --> 00:13:19,620
That's pretty good

3302

4214
00:22:26,970 --> 00:22:27,000
Go home, idiot!

4215
00:22:27,000 --> 00:22:27,030
Go home, idiot!

4216
00:22:27,030 --> 00:22:27,070
Go home, idiot!

4217
00:22:27,070 --> 00:22:27,100
Go home, idiot!

4218
00:22:27,100 --> 00:22:29,300
Go home, idiot!

4219
00:22:27,370 --> 00:22:27,500
idiot!

4220
00:22:27,500 --> 00:22:27,520
idiot!

4221
00:22:27,520 --> 00:22:27,530
idiot!

4222
00:22:27,530 --> 00:22:27,570
idiot!

4223
00:22:27,570 --> 00:22:27,600
idiot!

4224
00:22:27,600 --> 00:22:27,630
idiot!

4225
00:22:27,630 --> 00:22:27,670
idiot!

4226
00:22:27,670 --> 00:22:27,700
idiot!

4227
00:22:27,700 --> 00:22:29,300
idiot!

4228
00:22:28,170 --> 00:22:29,340
I was thinking that too

4229
00:22:29,920 --> 00:22:32,370
What the hell?

4230
00:22:32,470 --> 00:22:33,140
Right?

4231
00:22:38,680 --> 00:22:40,210
Right

4232
00:22:41,560 --> 00:22:43,780
No, this isn't working at all. This script isn't working

4233
00:22:43,780 --> 00:22:45,350
As I thought, Matsumoto-kun, it has to be you

4234
00:22:45,350 --> 00:22:46,750
As I thought, Matsumoto-kun, it has to be you

4235
00:22:46,750 --> 00:22:48,840
Let's continue this climax scene

4236
00:22:48,950 --> 00:22:51,570
I'm counting on you! Okay-- Action!

4237
00:22:51,540 --> 00:27:23,960
Love Rival Matsumoto

4238
00:22:51,970 --> 00:22:52,620
Masatoshi...

4239
00:22:55,430 --> 00:22:59,890
Whether Ayumi's Aoharu will end with a smile or with tears...

4240
00:22:59,900 --> 00:23:01,840
It all depends on you

4241
00:23:03,250 --> 00:23:03,720
Hitoshi...

4242
00:23:06,540 --> 00:23:09,540
What is your Aoharu? Tell me

4243
00:23:13,550 --> 00:23:16,880
Aoharu?

4244
00:23:13,550 --> 00:23:22,640
T/N: "Aoharu" is written with the same character for "seishun" which means "youth". It's used in many ways such as in Cup Noodle commercials, a camera app, manga, etc. so it's hard to understand what the question is asking.

4245
00:23:21,520 --> 00:23:22,640
What's Aoharu?

4246
00:23:22,690 --> 00:23:23,690
Aoharu?

4247
00:23:25,120 --> 00:23:27,830
Please work hard!

4248
00:23:26,310 --> 00:23:27,890
It doesn't ring a bell to me...

4249
00:23:29,430 --> 00:23:31,670
You don't understand Aoharu?

4250
00:23:32,700 --> 00:23:34,700
I'm sorry...

4251
00:23:35,150 --> 00:23:36,440
Aoharu. It's Aoharu

4252
00:23:38,740 --> 00:23:41,540
I don't understand Aoharu...

4253
00:23:41,540 --> 00:23:43,180
It's just a normal Aoharu

4254
00:23:43,890 --> 00:23:44,930
You get it, right?

4255
00:23:45,560 --> 00:23:47,380
Ah, you mean that?

4256
00:23:48,680 --> 00:23:50,820
Family...

4257
00:23:50,820 --> 00:23:52,350
A family's love, right?

4258
00:23:52,790 --> 00:23:55,590
It's not that, at all!

4259
00:23:53,420 --> 00:23:53,550
t's not that, at all!

4260
00:23:53,550 --> 00:23:53,570
t's not that, at all!

4261
00:23:53,570 --> 00:23:53,590
t's not that, at all!

4262
00:23:53,590 --> 00:23:53,620
t's not that, at all!

4263
00:23:53,620 --> 00:23:53,650
t's not that, at all!

4264
00:23:53,650 --> 00:23:53,690
t's not that, at all!

4265
00:23:53,690 --> 00:23:53,720
t's not that, at all!

4266
00:23:53,720 --> 00:23:53,750
t's not that, at all!

4267
00:23:53,750 --> 00:23:55,590
t's not that, at all!

4268
00:23:59,980 --> 00:24:01,730
Please give the correct answer

4269
00:24:01,830 --> 00:24:02,660
Do y'all know it?

4270
00:24:05,750 --> 00:24:06,200
Huh?

4271
00:24:06,880 --> 00:24:08,140
Then explain it to me, for real

4272
00:24:08,150 --> 00:24:09,470
What is Aoharu?

4273
00:24:11,500 --> 00:24:12,120
That's enough

4274
00:24:12,500 --> 00:24:14,100
You're kidding me

4275
00:24:14,790 --> 00:24:15,810
Aoharu is...

4276
00:24:15,870 --> 00:24:17,490
For real?

4277
00:24:18,530 --> 00:24:20,890
Oh, her condition is...

4278
00:24:21,160 --> 00:24:23,780
I made it...

4279
00:24:25,020 --> 00:24:26,240
Are you dumb?

4280
00:24:27,050 --> 00:24:29,690
Are you okay?

4281
00:24:30,620 --> 00:24:32,310
Ryoma, Hii-kun

4282
00:24:32,320 --> 00:24:34,090
Ryoma, Hii-kun

4283
00:24:34,090 --> 00:24:36,080
I don't want to die

4284
00:24:36,210 --> 00:24:38,730
I really don't want to die

4285
00:24:41,400 --> 00:24:42,570
Hey, Hitoshi!

4286
00:24:43,900 --> 00:24:44,540
Hitoshi!

4287
00:24:53,810 --> 00:25:00,420
Aoharu High School

4288
00:24:53,810 --> 00:25:00,420
The main actor is laughing at an important moment

4289
00:24:56,480 --> 00:24:59,420
There's no cue cards or anything

4290
00:25:06,530 --> 00:25:07,510
Oi! What the hell...

4291
00:25:09,560 --> 00:25:13,470
A letter at a time like this...

4292
00:25:13,820 --> 00:25:14,680
What the hell...

4293
00:25:17,920 --> 00:25:22,090
Ryoma, Hii-kun

4294
00:25:20,620 --> 00:25:23,540
Ryoma, Hii-kun

4295
00:25:23,540 --> 00:25:27,810
If you two are reading this letter

4296
00:25:27,850 --> 00:25:30,780
I'm probably no longer in this world

4297
00:25:29,460 --> 00:25:32,730
I'm probably no longer in this world

4298
00:25:32,800 --> 00:25:34,840
You're a hot-headed weirdo, but

4299
00:25:34,840 --> 00:25:38,760
You're still my the best friend, Ryoma

4300
00:25:38,760 --> 00:25:41,310
Even though you're shy and quiet

4301
00:25:41,310 --> 00:25:47,020
You always watched over us so kindly, Hii-kun

4302
00:25:47,020 --> 00:25:52,770
To me, you two are suta... Sorry

4303
00:25:50,600 --> 00:25:52,770
To me, you two are suta... Sorry

4304
00:25:52,770 --> 00:25:56,380
Hahahaha

4305
00:25:55,540 --> 00:25:56,380
You're half-assing it!

4306
00:25:59,440 --> 00:26:00,300
What are you doing fumbling over the letter!

4307
00:26:00,160 --> 00:26:01,060
What the hell?

4308
00:26:01,030 --> 00:26:01,850
What are you doing?

4309
00:26:01,410 --> 00:26:07,390
Aoharu High School

4310
00:26:01,410 --> 00:26:07,390
Fumbling over reading the sentimental letter

4311
00:26:03,080 --> 00:26:04,620
Right at the good part...

4312
00:26:04,880 --> 00:26:06,880
Hold on...

4313
00:26:05,420 --> 00:26:07,870
This was a recording! Just redo it

4314
00:26:08,150 --> 00:26:09,690
They should have started over

4315
00:26:10,420 --> 00:26:11,780
It was such an important scene

4316
00:26:11,520 --> 00:26:12,960
Okay, cut!!

4317
00:26:12,980 --> 00:26:16,530
That's a wrap! Thank you for your hard work!

4318
00:26:16,530 --> 00:26:18,100
Ehhh, so...

4319
00:26:18,100 --> 00:26:21,700
Let's have all the actors take a bow!

4320
00:26:22,400 --> 00:26:23,750
What the hell

4321
00:26:23,900 --> 00:26:25,070
What is this!?

4322
00:26:25,320 --> 00:26:29,880
Let's have the cast give a greeting

4323
00:26:29,910 --> 00:26:33,760
Actor Matsumoto, thank you very much. Your acting was lovely

4324
00:26:29,910 --> 00:26:37,150
Aoharu High School

4325
00:26:29,910 --> 00:26:37,150
The whole movie cast comes out for greetings

4326
00:26:33,810 --> 00:26:35,130
Ah, really?

4327
00:26:35,130 --> 00:26:37,880
Thank you very much. It was great

4328
00:26:38,050 --> 00:26:39,450
Matsumoto-san's acting

4329
00:26:39,450 --> 00:26:42,290
Made it hard to believe he's a comedian, it felt like real acting

4330
00:26:42,290 --> 00:26:43,820
I learned a lot, thank you

4331
00:26:48,240 --> 00:26:50,030
Next, Takeuchi-kun

4332
00:26:50,030 --> 00:26:51,230
Thank you very much, really

4333
00:26:52,770 --> 00:26:53,730
I went to Kobe for a shoot...

4334
00:26:53,730 --> 00:26:56,500
I went to Kobe for a shoot...

4335
00:26:56,500 --> 00:26:58,270
And at the hotel, I kind of

4336
00:27:00,010 --> 00:27:03,040
I took a secret photo of Matsumoto-san

4337
00:27:03,040 --> 00:27:04,390
Forgive me, but it was such a great photo

4338
00:27:04,410 --> 00:27:06,130
I put it in a frame

4339
00:27:11,230 --> 00:27:12,930
That's an amazing secret photo

4340
00:27:13,120 --> 00:27:13,820
This is no good!!

4341
00:27:13,820 --> 00:27:16,790
This is no good!!

4342
00:27:18,090 --> 00:27:20,930
What an amazing workout method

4343
00:27:24,480 --> 00:27:31,100
One hour since the start

4344
00:27:24,480 --> 00:27:31,100
The bus' journey is still not over

4345
00:27:25,610 --> 00:27:27,230
One hour since start

4346
00:27:28,000 --> 00:27:30,000
The bus' journey is still not over

4347
00:27:31,470 --> 00:27:35,310
It's so far

4348
00:27:32,570 --> 00:27:35,310
Right? We still haven't arrived yet...

4349
00:27:38,810 --> 00:27:42,280
Arrived at a bus stop

4350
00:27:39,010 --> 00:27:42,280
Arrived at a bus stop

4351
00:27:39,580 --> 00:27:40,030
Arrived at a bus stop

4352
00:27:39,580 --> 00:27:42,280
Arrived at a bus stop

4353
00:27:40,760 --> 00:27:42,760
It seemed to have stopped

4354
00:27:43,030 --> 00:27:44,330
What is it?

4355
00:27:44,330 --> 00:27:48,750
Leave me alone! Stop following me, just take a hint!

4356
00:27:45,350 --> 00:27:46,500
Please listen to us!

4357
00:27:46,990 --> 00:27:48,000
Please!

4358
00:27:48,020 --> 00:27:48,750
Please!

4359
00:27:48,750 --> 00:27:49,740
Please give us a chance!

4360
00:27:49,350 --> 00:27:51,350
That's enough, already...

4361
00:27:49,750 --> 00:27:51,060
Please give us a chance!

4362
00:27:51,660 --> 00:27:53,510
C'mon, man...

4363
00:27:51,660 --> 00:27:55,300
Ganbareruya

4364
00:27:51,660 --> 00:27:55,300
Komoto Junichi

4365
00:27:51,660 --> 00:27:55,300
Producer

4366
00:27:51,660 --> 00:27:55,300
Yoshiko

4367
00:27:52,970 --> 00:27:53,760
Please!

4368
00:27:53,760 --> 00:27:54,310
Please!

4369
00:27:54,310 --> 00:27:57,510
We want to stand on that stage! That's why we came all the way from Japan!

4370
00:27:55,300 --> 00:27:58,500
Actress

4371
00:27:55,300 --> 00:27:58,500
Matsumoto Marika

4372
00:27:58,500 --> 00:28:02,860
You know that only the best talents and entertainment shows can make it in Las Vegas, right?

4373
00:28:02,900 --> 00:28:08,120
You're a comedian, right? And you're an actress? Just putting you two together isn't going to make it a hit

4374
00:28:02,900 --> 00:28:09,540
A comedian and actress duo want to try out

4375
00:28:02,900 --> 00:28:09,540
Popular Audition Show

4376
00:28:08,520 --> 00:28:12,030
Please give us a chance! We worked so hard on our skit

4377
00:28:12,030 --> 00:28:13,110
Please!

4378
00:28:13,110 --> 00:28:15,480
Can you actually do it?

4379
00:28:14,000 --> 00:28:15,480
Yes we can

4380
00:28:15,490 --> 00:28:17,020
Okay, then make these five people laugh

4381
00:28:17,020 --> 00:28:18,720
Okay, then make these five people laugh

4382
00:28:18,720 --> 00:28:22,720
If you make them burst out laughing, I'll let you on the show

4383
00:28:21,290 --> 00:28:22,440
Understood

4384
00:28:24,520 --> 00:28:25,920
Ready... Start!

4385
00:28:26,560 --> 00:28:28,560
Okay, so from here on, we will show you all a

4386
00:28:28,560 --> 00:28:32,600
Surprise Illusion

4387
00:28:31,900 --> 00:28:32,600
First off,

4388
00:28:32,600 --> 00:28:33,630
I will put on this eye mask

4389
00:28:33,630 --> 00:28:36,200
I will put on this eye mask

4390
00:28:36,200 --> 00:28:37,540
And I will

4391
00:28:37,540 --> 00:28:40,410
Take this paper fan, hold it above her head

4392
00:28:40,410 --> 00:28:42,410
And hit her as hard as I can

4393
00:28:40,410 --> 00:28:42,410
Take this paper fan, hold it above her head

4394
00:28:41,540 --> 00:28:42,710
However!

4395

You asshole!!

4580
00:32:16,050 --> 00:32:17,660
It's your fault they're not laughing

4581

You asshole! It's your fault!

4582
00:32:17,690 --> 00:32:21,460
Actress and Comedian Duo

4583
00:32:17,690 --> 00:32:21,460
Gets super angry when the joke doesn't land

4584
00:32:19,690 --> 00:32:21,450
You were the one who failed to land the joke!

4585
00:32:21,480 --> 00:32:23,230
You asshole!!

4586
00:32:23,450 --> 00:32:25,410
It's your fault for doing an impression like Aunt Komori!

4587
00:32:25,970 --> 00:32:29,140
You spent 20 years building your career in relative obscurity

4588
00:32:27,830 --> 00:32:28,910
You asshole

4589
00:32:29,140 --> 00:32:29,940
You only finally won an award in your 19th year

00:32:29,400 --> 00:32:30,080

You only finally won an award in your 19th year

4592
00:32:31,040 --> 00:32:32,010
You asshole!!

00:32:31,420 --> 00:32:32,510
An award for a movie

4594
00:32:32,010 --> 00:32:32,960
Damnit! That's right

4595
00:32:32,960 --> 00:32:34,030
What kind of award did you win?

4596
00:32:34,040 --> 00:32:34,840
You asshole

4597
00:32:34,840 --> 00:32:35,720

But you guys don't have anything else, right?

4620
00:33:07,050 --> 00:33:08,850

4621
00:33:08,850 --> 00:33:09,670

Impromptu riddles

4629
00:33:17,200 --> 00:33:24,560
The duo's comedy routine

4630
00:33:19,950 --> 00:33:21,370
Well...

4631
00:33:22,140 --> 00:33:24,560
How about Downtown's Hamada?

4632
00:33:24,790 --> 00:33:26,530
Sounds good!

4633
00:33:26,930 --> 00:33:35,300
Speaking of "Downtown's Hamada" and

4634
00:33:30,570 --> 00:33:35,300
"Shining a light on a mirror"

4635
00:33:33,370 --> 00:33:35,300
What are you thinking of?

4636
00:33:35,300 --> 00:33:37,500
Hansha

4637
00:33:35,300 --> 00:33:37,500
T/N: Hansha can mean reflection (反射) or organized crime (反社)

4638
00:33:36,060 --> 00:33:37,510
Enough already, idiots

4639
00:33:39,350 --> 00:33:40,470
You wanna get punched or something?

4640
00:33:49,950 --> 00:33:52,190
They came with it so suddenly

4641
00:33:52,190 --> 00:33:56,350
Enough. There's no more time, so that's enough. It's all messed up

4642
00:33:56,350 --> 00:34:01,090
This is so messed up. Please wait

4643
00:33:59,650 --> 00:34:01,270
Please wait a little!

4644
00:34:01,280 --> 00:34:01,380
Asshole!!

4645
00:34:01,380 --> 00:34:01,400
Asshole!!

4646
00:34:01,400 --> 00:34:01,410
Asshole!!

4647
00:34:01,410 --> 00:34:01,430
Asshole!!

4648
00:34:01,430 --> 00:34:01,450
Asshole!!

Asshole!! I'm sorry

4657
00:34:04,610 --> 00:34:05,930
They sure said asshole a lot

4658
00:34:05,930 --> 00:34:07,120
Sure did

4659
00:34:08,300 --> 00:34:09,120
Yeah

4660
00:34:11,210 --> 00:34:14,580
Saying Star's Coins was no good

4661
00:34:14,580 --> 00:34:18,280
Say what her most representative work is then. Say it one by one

4662
00:34:16,610 --> 00:34:18,280
Evolution of Wind

4663
00:34:18,280 --> 00:34:20,750
Evolution of Wind!?

4664
00:34:22,690 --> 00:34:24,060
He sure is laughing a lot

4665
00:34:27,010 --> 00:34:27,990
I'm fine

4666
00:34:27,360 --> 00:34:28,990
Evolution of Wind!?

4667
00:34:28,760 --> 00:34:30,110
You, fine?

4668
00:34:34,050 --> 00:34:36,520
You were totally influenced by my "Star's Coins"

4669
00:34:38,450 --> 00:34:46,670
Just a bit of the bus journey left

4670
00:34:38,450 --> 00:34:46,670
The hotel they're going to

4671
00:34:38,450 --> 00:34:46,670
is right in front of them

4672
00:34:47,260 --> 00:34:48,640
Everyone, we'll soon be reaching

4673
00:34:49,310 --> 00:34:55,750
The hotel said to be the strongest in Las Vegas

4674
00:34:52,180 --> 00:34:55,750
Omamett Regency

4675
00:34:54,790 --> 00:34:55,640
Oh, Omamett Regency

4676
00:34:55,750 --> 00:34:56,730
So we're reaching it soon

4677
00:34:57,450 --> 00:35:02,490
I don't get what  you mean by the strongest

4678
00:34:59,440 --> 00:35:01,740
Who originally said that?

4679
00:35:02,490 --> 00:35:07,330
If it's the strongest hotel, then there's no way we can win

4680
00:35:04,470 --> 00:35:07,330
We don't really want to go there, then

4681
00:35:08,650 --> 00:35:13,160
Las Vegas, a gathering place for people who dream of striking it rich

4682
00:35:13,890 --> 00:35:16,950
This will be the stage this year

4683

Omamett Regency Hotels & Casino

4687
00:35:21,270 --> 00:35:27,550
The fierce battles with the assassins will take place here

4688
00:35:28,050 --> 00:35:33,190
We are heading to the casino, this hotel's pride and joy

4689
00:35:29,870 --> 00:35:30,810
Looks amazing

4690
00:35:33,200 --> 00:35:33,640
Amazing

4691
00:35:33,640 --> 00:35:35,160
What a super luxurious hotel!

4692
00:35:35,760 --> 00:35:37,530
Amazing, isn't it?

00:35:37,650 --> 00:35:38,270
Let's go in

4698
00:35:45,390 --> 00:35:46,910
Wow, awesome

4699
00:35:46,910 --> 00:35:49,420
This really is amazing

4700
00:35:49,420 --> 00:35:51,430
They're all playing. There's a show, too

4701
00:35:51,110 --> 00:35:52,220
Oh, yeah

4702
00:35:52,220 --> 00:35:53,040
Yeah

4703
00:35:53,510 --> 00:35:56,180
We've just reached the hotel but

4704
00:35:56,180 --> 00:35:58,480
The Omamett Regency's owner

4705
00:35:58,480 --> 00:36:00,620
Said that they wanted to meet you all, so let's go there now

4706
00:36:00,620 --> 00:36:05,050
Said that they wanted to meet you all, so let's go there now

4707
00:36:02,130 --> 00:36:04,920
Oh, we're meeting the owner

Omamett Regency

4709
00:36:05,220 --> 00:36:11,260
The usual paying of greetings to the hotel owner

4710
00:36:07,100 --> 00:36:10,110
All right, Hamada, Matsumoto...

4711
00:36:10,140 --> 00:36:10,490
Okay

4712
00:36:11,720 --> 00:36:14,910
A bigwig sure is different

4713
00:36:13,240 --> 00:36:13,440
Wow

4714
00:36:13,440 --> 00:36:14,920
They're a wealthy person

4715
00:36:15,020 --> 00:36:18,000
Everyone, the owner's coming soon

4716
00:36:18,000 --> 00:36:18,270
Okay

4717
00:36:18,270 --> 00:36:19,690
Um, don't be rude

4718
00:36:19,800 --> 00:36:20,210
Right

4719
00:36:21,690 --> 00:36:22,890
There's no way we'd be rude

4720
00:36:26,570 --> 00:36:31,550
Hotel owner

4721
00:36:26,570 --> 00:36:31,550
Kanno

4722
00:36:26,570 --> 00:36:31,550
Miho

4723
00:36:26,570 --> 00:36:31,550
T/N: Kanno Miho is a veteran actress married to Sakai Masato

4724
00:36:32,150 --> 00:36:35,110
Welcome to Hotel Omamett Agency

4725
00:36:35,110 --> 00:36:38,380
I am the owner of this hotel Kwanno

4726
00:36:37,100 --> 00:36:38,380
Kwanno

4727
00:36:42,250 --> 00:36:43,020
Amazing

4728
00:36:42,250 --> 00:36:43,020
Kwanno?

00:36:43,130 --> 00:36:44,040
Kwanno?

4730
00:36:43,430 --> 00:36:44,870
You're named Kwanno?

4731
00:36:48,830 --> 00:36:49,720
Kwanno...

4732
00:36:50,060 --> 00:36:51,350
Here in Las Vegas

4733
00:36:51,330 --> 00:36:54,270
Isn't an exaggeration,

4734
00:36:51,330 --> 00:36:56,570
Here in Las Vegas, saying"Money is everything"

4735
00:36:54,270 --> 00:36:56,570
Isn't an exaggeration, for this is a city of gambling

4736
00:36:57,270 --> 00:36:59,840
However, money is something you use; not something to be used by

4737
00:36:59,840 --> 00:37:01,840
However, money is something you use; not something to be used by

4738
00:37:02,280 --> 00:37:05,850
Your life is over if you become a slave to money

4739
00:37:05,850 --> 00:37:05,960
It means the destruction of your life!!

4740
00:37:05,960 --> 00:37:05,980
It means the destruction of your life!!

4741
00:37:05,980 --> 00:37:06,000
It means the destruction of your life!!

4742
00:37:06,000 --> 00:37:06,010
It means the destruction of your life!!

4743
00:37:06,010 --> 00:37:06,030
It means the destruction of your life!!

4744
00:37:06,030 --> 00:37:06,050
It means the destruction of your life!!

4745
00:37:06,050 --> 00:37:06,060
It means the destruction of your life!!

4746
00:37:06,060 --> 00:37:06,080
It means the destruction of your life!!

4747
00:37:06,080 --> 00:37:06,100
It means the destruction of your life!!

4748
00:37:06,100 --> 00:37:06,110
It means the destruction of your life!!

4749
00:37:06,110 --> 00:37:07,780
It means the destruction of your life!!

4750
00:37:07,780 --> 00:37:09,450
What's wrong with her, all of a sudden...

4751
00:37:10,520 --> 00:37:11,710
What the heck?

4752
00:37:12,630 --> 00:37:14,950
Don't say it!

4753
00:37:15,760 --> 00:37:17,500
Isn't she in a strange mood?

4754
00:37:17,740 --> 00:37:19,310
She just suddenly got into it

4755
00:37:23,200 --> 00:37:28,270
Why are you desperately searching

4756
00:37:26,600 --> 00:37:28,270
For money?

4757
00:37:28,270 --> 00:37:29,640
Hosei, what does money mean to you?

4758
00:37:29,640 --> 00:37:32,940
Hosei, what does money mean to you?

4759
00:37:32,940 --> 00:37:34,270
The future

4760
00:37:35,240 --> 00:37:38,240
That way of thinking does exist

4761
00:37:40,510 --> 00:37:42,350
Hamada, what does money mean to you?

4762
00:37:42,350 --> 00:37:44,680
Hamada, what does money mean to you?

4763
00:37:45,950 --> 00:37:48,270
Well, it's needed to live...

4764
00:37:48,250 --> 00:37:54,390
Well, it's needed to live...

4765
00:37:49,390 --> 00:37:49,720
Huh? What do you mean by that?

4766
00:37:49,720 --> 00:37:54,310
Huh? What do you mean by that?

4767
00:37:56,360 --> 00:37:57,900
Quite a strong reaction, wasn't it?

4768
00:38:00,400 --> 00:38:02,270
What does that mean?

4769
00:38:02,270 --> 00:38:04,140
Um...

4770
00:38:04,140 --> 00:38:08,840
It's something that you won't be troubled by having...

4771
00:38:05,940 --> 00:38:06,140
Huh? What do you mean by that?

4772
00:38:06,140 --> 00:38:08,840
Huh? What do you mean by that?

4773
00:38:17,950 --> 00:38:18,890
And, so....

4774
00:38:18,890 --> 00:38:21,190
There is something I wish to show all of you

4775
00:38:27,030 --> 00:38:29,230
Did you bring that here?

4776
00:38:28,530 --> 00:38:29,880
You're supposed to bring it here!

4777
00:38:29,230 --> 00:38:32,270
Hotel Staff

4778
00:38:29,230 --> 00:38:32,270
Kinchan

4779
00:38:29,230 --> 00:38:32,270
Onigoe Tomahawk

4780
00:38:29,230 --> 00:38:32,270
Sakai Ryouta

4781
00:38:29,890 --> 00:38:30,750
No, you!

4782
00:38:30,860 --> 00:38:31,930
I don't know about this

4783
00:38:31,950 --> 00:38:32,480
I don't know either!

4784
00:38:32,600 --> 00:38:33,970
Stop fooling around

4785
00:38:33,170 --> 00:38:33,970
You stop fooling around

4786
00:38:34,970 --> 00:38:37,340
Hey, stop it

4787
00:38:37,340 --> 00:38:40,880
We're in front of our guests so stop it!!

4788
00:38:38,870 --> 00:38:38,890
stop it!!

4789
00:38:38,890 --> 00:38:38,910
stop it!!

4790
00:38:38,910 --> 00:38:38,920
stop it!!

4791
00:38:38,920 --> 00:38:38,940
stop it!!

4792
00:38:38,940 --> 00:38:38,960
stop it!!

4793
00:38:38,960 --> 00:38:38,970
stop it!!

4794
00:38:38,970 --> 00:38:38,990
stop it!!

4795
00:38:38,990 --> 00:38:39,010
stop it!!

4796
00:38:39,010 --> 00:38:39,020
stop it!!

4797
00:38:39,020 --> 00:38:39,040
stop it!!

4798
00:38:39,040 --> 00:38:39,060
stop it!!

4799
00:38:39,060 --> 00:38:39,070
stop it!!

4800
00:38:39,070 --> 00:38:39,090
stop it!!

4801
00:38:39,090 --> 00:38:39,110
stop it!!

4802
00:38:39,110 --> 00:38:40,880
stop it!!

4803
00:38:39,740 --> 00:38:39,760
Shut up!!

4804
00:38:39,760 --> 00:38:39,770
Shut up!!

4805
00:38:39,770 --> 00:38:39,790
Shut up!!

4806
00:38:39,790 --> 00:38:39,810
Shut up!!

4807
00:38:39,810 --> 00:38:39,820
Shut up!!

4808
00:38:39,820 --> 00:38:39,840
Shut up!!

4809
00:38:39,840 --> 00:38:39,860
Shut up!!

4810
00:38:39,860 --> 00:38:39,870
Shut up!!

4811
00:38:39,870 --> 00:38:39,890
Shut up!!

4812
00:38:39,890 --> 00:38:39,910
Shut up!!

4813
00:38:39,910 --> 00:38:39,920
Shut up!!

4814
00:38:39,920 --> 00:38:39,940
Shut up!!

4815
00:38:39,940 --> 00:38:39,960
Shut up!!

4816
00:38:39,960 --> 00:38:39,970
Shut up!!

4817
00:38:39,970 --> 00:38:40,880
Shut up!!

4818
00:38:40,880 --> 00:38:44,980
Among all of Japan's actresses

4819
00:38:41,940 --> 00:38:44,980
You're considered the dumbest

4820
00:38:45,190 --> 00:38:46,830
That's not true

4821
00:38:46,830 --> 00:38:47,980
No, no

4822
00:38:47,980 --> 00:38:49,450
Sorry, I don't think he really means that...

4823
00:38:49,550 --> 00:38:51,790
You sometimes make weird faces on variety shows, don't you?

4824
00:38:51,820 --> 00:38:55,090
I believe he just thinks

4825
00:38:53,120 --> 00:38:55,090
This person is strange

4826
00:38:55,240 --> 00:38:56,590
She's doing it!

4827
00:38:55,240 --> 00:38:56,590
What's with that?

4828
00:39:02,430 --> 00:39:03,450
Seriously?

4829
00:39:06,230 --> 00:39:07,500
Fine, just go bring that here already

4830
00:39:07,500 --> 00:39:08,800
I'll go bring that here

4831
00:39:08,800 --> 00:39:11,040
Wait, wait

4832
00:39:09,740 --> 00:39:11,040
She told me to bring that here, not you

4833
00:39:11,040 --> 00:39:12,140
I just have to bring that here, right?

4834
00:39:12,140 --> 00:39:12,160
Stop messing around, you bastard

4835
00:39:12,160 --> 00:39:12,170
Stop messing around, you bastard

4836
00:39:12,170 --> 00:39:12,190
Stop messing around, you bastard

4837
00:39:12,190 --> 00:39:12,210
Stop messing around, you bastard

4838
00:39:12,210 --> 00:39:12,220
Stop messing around, you bastard

4839
00:39:12,220 --> 00:39:12,240
Stop messing around, you bastard

4840
00:39:12,240 --> 00:39:12,260
Stop messing around, you bastard

4841
00:39:12,260 --> 00:39:12,270
Stop messing around, you bastard

4842
00:39:12,270 --> 00:39:12,290
Stop messing around, you bastard

4843
00:39:12,290 --> 00:39:12,310
Stop messing around, you bastard

4844
00:39:12,310 --> 00:39:12,320
Stop messing around, you bastard

4845
00:39:12,320 --> 00:39:12,340
Stop messing around, you bastard

4846
00:39:12,340 --> 00:39:12,360
Stop messing around, you bastard

4847
00:39:12,360 --> 00:39:12,370
Stop messing around, you bastard

4848
00:39:12,370 --> 00:39:14,380
Stop messing around, you bastard

4849
00:39:14,380 --> 00:39:16,440
Hey, stop it! We're in front of guests!

4850
00:39:17,480 --> 00:39:20,550
Hosei... Can you please stop them

4851
00:39:20,550 --> 00:39:21,120
Hey

4852
00:39:21,120 --> 00:39:22,250
Hey, stop this

4853
00:39:22,250 --> 00:39:23,750
Everyone's telling you to stop!

4854
00:39:23,750 --> 00:39:23,770
Shut up!!

4855
00:39:23,770 --> 00:39:23,780
Shut up!!

4856
00:39:23,780 --> 00:39:23,800
Shut up!!

4857
00:39:23,800 --> 00:39:23,820
Shut up!!

4858
00:39:23,820 --> 00:39:23,830
Shut up!!

4859
00:39:23,830 --> 00:39:23,850
Shut up!!

4860
00:39:23,850 --> 00:39:23,870
Shut up!!

4861
00:39:23,870 --> 00:39:23,880
Shut up!!

4862
00:39:23,880 --> 00:39:23,900
Shut up!!

4863
00:39:23,900 --> 00:39:23,920
Shut up!!

4864
00:39:23,920 --> 00:39:23,930
Shut up!!

4865
00:39:23,930 --> 00:39:23,950
Shut up!!

4866
00:39:23,950 --> 00:39:23,970
Shut up!!

4867
00:39:23,970 --> 00:39:23,980
Shut up!!

4868
00:39:23,980 --> 00:39:24,790
Shut up!!

4869
00:39:24,790 --> 00:39:28,720
You live in Osaka now, so don't just brazenly

4870
00:39:26,790 --> 00:39:26,800
Come to Tokyo for work

4871
00:39:26,800 --> 00:39:26,820
Come to Tokyo for work

4872
00:39:26,820 --> 00:39:26,840
Come to Tokyo for work

4873
00:39:26,840 --> 00:39:26,850
Come to Tokyo for work

4874
00:39:26,850 --> 00:39:26,870
Come to Tokyo for work

4875
00:39:26,870 --> 00:39:26,890
Come to Tokyo for work

4876
00:39:26,890 --> 00:39:26,900
Come to Tokyo for work

4877
00:39:26,900 --> 00:39:26,920
Come to Tokyo for work

4878
00:39:26,920 --> 00:39:26,940
Come to Tokyo for work

4879
00:39:26,940 --> 00:39:26,950
Come to Tokyo for work

4880
00:39:26,950 --> 00:39:26,970
Come to Tokyo for work

4881
00:39:26,970 --> 00:39:26,990
Come to Tokyo for work

4882
00:39:26,990 --> 00:39:27,000
Come to Tokyo for work

4883
00:39:27,000 --> 00:39:27,020
Come to Tokyo for work

4884
00:39:27,020 --> 00:39:27,040
Come to Tokyo for work

4885
00:39:27,040 --> 00:39:27,050
Come to Tokyo for work

4886
00:39:27,050 --> 00:39:28,720
Come to Tokyo for work

4887
00:39:29,920 --> 00:39:32,090
Sorry, I don't think he really means that...

4888
00:39:32,380 --> 00:39:38,430
The TV stations have been cutting production funds

4889
00:39:35,280 --> 00:39:38,430
Paying for bullet train first class car reserved seat tickets

4890
00:39:38,460 --> 00:39:44,140
For a balding comedian who's never found success like you

4891
00:39:40,720 --> 00:39:44,140
It makes no sense

4892
00:39:42,240 --> 00:39:44,140
It makes no sense that's all they're saying

4893
00:39:44,140 --> 00:39:45,500
What a horrible thing to say

4894
00:39:49,640 --> 00:39:52,010
The cost performance isn't that good...

4895
00:39:55,010 --> 00:39:57,050
I'll bring that here

4896
00:39:55,720 --> 00:39:57,050
I said I'd go

4897
00:39:57,050 --> 00:39:58,420
I can do it

4898
00:39:58,420 --> 00:40:00,350
I said I'd go

4899
00:40:00,350 --> 00:40:02,120
You're in front of the guests! This is horrible!!

4900
00:40:02,120 --> 00:40:04,460
Stop this at once

4901
00:40:05,210 --> 00:40:06,430
She's really getting into the middle of their fight

4902
00:40:06,430 --> 00:40:06,540
Stop this!!

4903
00:40:06,540 --> 00:40:06,560
Stop this!!

4904
00:40:06,560 --> 00:40:06,580
Stop this!!

4905
00:40:06,580 --> 00:40:06,590
Stop this!!

4906
00:40:06,590 --> 00:40:06,610
Stop this!!

4907
00:40:06,610 --> 00:40:06,630
Stop this!!

4908
00:40:06,630 --> 00:40:06,640
Stop this!!

4909
00:40:06,640 --> 00:40:06,660
Stop this!!

4910
00:40:06,660 --> 00:40:06,680
Stop this!!

4911
00:40:06,680 --> 00:40:06,690
Stop this!!

4912
00:40:06,690 --> 00:40:10,200
Stop this!!

4913
00:40:10,830 --> 00:40:14,990
You're not supposed to seriously try to stop them like that

4914
00:40:16,500 --> 00:40:18,270
You're not supposed to seriously try to stop them like that!!

4915
00:40:19,400 --> 00:40:19,970
No, no...

4916
00:40:24,150 --> 00:40:25,210
Excuse me, Matsumoto

4917
00:40:25,210 --> 00:40:26,550
Could I ask you to stop the fight, please?

4918
00:40:27,010 --> 00:40:28,050
Hey, stop that, stop that!

4919
00:40:28,050 --> 00:40:29,030
Stop that, I said!

4920
00:40:29,250 --> 00:40:29,270
Shut up already!!

4921
00:40:29,270 --> 00:40:29,280
Shut up already!!

4922
00:40:29,280 --> 00:40:29,300
Shut up already!!

4923
00:40:29,300 --> 00:40:29,320
Shut up already!!

4924
00:40:29,320 --> 00:40:29,330
Shut up already!!

4925
00:40:29,330 --> 00:40:29,350
Shut up already!!

4926
00:40:29,350 --> 00:40:29,370
Shut up already!!

4927
00:40:29,370 --> 00:40:29,380
Shut up already!!

4928
00:40:29,380 --> 00:40:29,400
Shut up already!!

4929
00:40:29,400 --> 00:40:29,420
Shut up already!!

4930
00:40:29,420 --> 00:40:29,430
Shut up already!!

4931
00:40:29,430 --> 00:40:29,450
Shut up already!!

4932
00:40:29,450 --> 00:40:29,470
Shut up already!!

4933
00:40:29,470 --> 00:40:29,480
Shut up already!!

4934
00:40:29,480 --> 00:40:30,420
Shut up already!!

4935
00:40:30,420 --> 00:40:34,620
The more muscle you put on,

4936
00:40:32,120 --> 00:40:34,620
The less laughs you're getting!

4937
00:40:34,620 --> 00:40:35,160
Excuse me but I don't think they really mean that...

4938
00:40:35,160 --> 00:40:37,020
Excuse me but I don't think they really mean that...

4939
00:40:37,090 --> 00:40:40,830
In case an intruder comes into my house,

4940
00:40:38,810 --> 00:40:40,830
Because I have someone I need to protect...

4941
00:40:40,840 --> 00:40:44,930
Is what you said, but then you got embarrassed

4942
00:40:42,200 --> 00:40:44,930
And your face turned all red and ended up bombing the joke

4943
00:40:45,010 --> 00:40:51,540
And so the comedy star Matsumoto Hitoshi's comedic muscle has died!!

4944
00:40:47,440 --> 00:40:51,540
...Is all that they're saying

4945
00:40:51,130 --> 00:40:52,270
That's what someone...

4946
00:40:52,520 --> 00:40:54,990
That's what someone from our side should say

4947
00:40:59,010 --> 00:41:02,250
Just bring it!

4948
00:40:59,810 --> 00:41:02,250
No, you bring it!

4949
00:41:04,000 --> 00:41:04,920
Um...

4950
00:41:04,920 --> 00:41:06,250
Tanaka, please...

4951
00:41:06,650 --> 00:41:07,770
Please stop the fight

4952
00:41:06,990 --> 00:41:08,450
We've warned you several times now. Stop the fighting

4953
00:41:08,450 --> 00:41:11,020
We've warned you several times now. Stop the fighting

4954
00:41:09,550 --> 00:41:11,020
Yes, understood

4955
00:41:14,440 --> 00:41:15,890
But that's also... you know

4956
00:41:17,230 --> 00:41:19,190
Must be because they have nothing to say about Tanaka

4957
00:41:20,070 --> 00:41:23,070
There must be something

4958
00:41:23,070 --> 00:41:24,370
Tanaka lacks a persona

4959
00:41:24,590 --> 00:41:25,990
Come on, strike back at me

4960
00:41:25,990 --> 00:41:27,130
So who will bring it?

4961
00:41:27,540 --> 00:41:28,640
I'll go

4962
00:41:28,040 --> 00:41:29,010
I'll go

4963
00:41:28,640 --> 00:41:29,670
No, I said I'll go

4964
00:41:29,670 --> 00:41:30,290
Oh, shut up!

4965
00:41:30,920 --> 00:41:32,850
Shut up already, you...

4966
00:41:32,850 --> 00:41:33,750
Will you two behave already! We're right in front of the guests!

4967
00:41:33,750 --> 00:41:36,050
Will you two behave already! We're right in front of the guests!

4968
00:41:37,310 --> 00:41:38,430
Excuse me, Hamada

4969
00:41:38,430 --> 00:41:40,340
Um, could you please stop the fight?

4970
00:41:41,220 --> 00:41:42,220
You better stop now

4971
00:41:42,920 --> 00:41:44,230
You're distressing her, so you better stop now

4972
00:41:44,230 --> 00:41:46,090
You're distressing her, so you better stop now

4973
00:41:46,090 --> 00:41:46,110
Oh shut it!!

4974
00:41:46,110 --> 00:41:46,130
Oh shut it!!

4975
00:41:46,130 --> 00:41:46,140
Oh shut it!!

4976
00:41:46,140 --> 00:41:46,160
Oh shut it!!

4977
00:41:46,160 --> 00:41:46,180
Oh shut it!!

4978
00:41:46,180 --> 00:41:46,190
Oh shut it!!

4979
00:41:46,190 --> 00:41:46,210
Oh shut it!!

4980
00:41:46,210 --> 00:41:46,230
Oh shut it!!

4981
00:41:46,230 --> 00:41:46,240
Oh shut it!!

4982
00:41:46,240 --> 00:41:46,260
Oh shut it!!

4983
00:41:46,260 --> 00:41:46,280
Oh shut it!!

4984
00:41:46,280 --> 00:41:46,290
Oh shut it!!

4985
00:41:46,290 --> 00:41:46,310
Oh shut it!!

4986
00:41:46,310 --> 00:41:46,330
Oh shut it!!

4987
00:41:46,330 --> 00:41:48,590
Oh shut it!!

4988
00:41:48,800 --> 00:41:54,670
Among your comedian friends you call each other by last name

4989
00:41:51,600 --> 00:41:54,670
But with actors and actresses

4990
00:41:52,880 --> 00:41:54,670
You are overly-familar calling Masaki Suda, "Masaki"

4991
00:41:54,730 --> 00:41:56,200
And Alice Hirose, "Alice"

4992
00:41:56,340 --> 00:42:00,610
Any time you see a popular actor, you call them by their first name

4993
00:41:58,860 --> 00:42:00,610
To try to close the distance too fast, so stop doing that!

4994
00:42:00,610 --> 00:42:00,720
Your ulterior motives are obvious!!

4995
00:42:00,720 --> 00:42:00,740
Your ulterior motives are obvious!!

4996
00:42:00,740 --> 00:42:00,760
Your ulterior motives are obvious!!

4997
00:42:00,760 --> 00:42:00,770
Your ulterior motives are obvious!!

4998
00:42:00,770 --> 00:42:00,790
Your ulterior motives are obvious!!

4999
00:42:00,790 --> 00:42:00,810
Your ulterior motives are obvious!!

5000
00:42:00,820 --> 00:42:00,830
Your ulterior motives are obvious!!

5001
00:42:00,830 --> 00:42:00,840
Your ulterior motives are obvious!!

5002
00:42:00,840 --> 00:42:00,860
Your ulterior motives are obvious!!

5003
00:42:00,860 --> 00:42:00,880
Your ulterior motives are obvious!!

5004
00:42:00,880 --> 00:42:04,210
Your ulterior motives are obvious!!

5005
00:42:02,630 --> 00:42:04,210
Wait, that wasn't...

5006
00:42:04,210 --> 00:42:06,250
That wasn't my intention

5007
00:42:06,250 --> 00:42:07,650
The things she says, wow

5008
00:42:07,650 --> 00:42:09,320
The owner here, wow

5009
00:42:13,020 --> 00:42:15,450
Aren't you going kind of hard on me?

5010
00:42:15,470 --> 00:42:15,490
And, you!!

5011
00:42:15,490 --> 00:42:15,510
And, you!!

5012
00:42:15,510 --> 00:42:15,520
And, you!!

5013
00:42:15,520 --> 00:42:15,540
And, you!!

5014
00:42:15,540 --> 00:42:15,560
And, you!!

5015
00:42:15,560 --> 00:42:15,570
And, you!!

5016
00:42:15,570 --> 00:42:15,590
And, you!!

5017
00:42:15,590 --> 00:42:15,610
And, you!!

5018
00:42:15,610 --> 00:42:15,620
And, you!!

5019
00:42:15,620 --> 00:42:15,640
And, you!!

5020
00:42:15,640 --> 00:42:15,660
And, you!!

5021
00:42:15,660 --> 00:42:15,670
And, you!!

5022
00:42:15,670 --> 00:42:15,690
And, you!!

5023
00:42:15,690 --> 00:42:16,320
And, you!!

5024
00:42:16,920 --> 00:42:19,930
Say that to separate your variety image from acting in dramas

5025
00:42:19,540 --> 00:42:19,930
Yes

5026
00:42:19,980 --> 00:42:24,300
You use the more difficult written character for

5027
00:42:22,060 --> 00:42:24,300
"Hama" in "Hamada" when you act in dramas

5028
00:42:24,360 --> 00:42:26,070
Don't try to add that depth to your persona!!

5029
00:42:26,130 --> 00:42:29,670
Nobody cares about

5030
00:42:27,270 --> 00:42:27,380
how to write your name differently!!

5031
00:42:27,400 --> 00:42:27,430
how to write your name differently!!

5032
00:42:27,430 --> 00:42:27,470
how to write your name differently!!

5033
00:42:27,470 --> 00:42:27,500
how to write your name differently!!

5034
00:42:27,500 --> 00:42:27,540
how to write your name differently!!

5035
00:42:27,540 --> 00:42:27,570
how to write your name differently!!

5036
00:42:27,570 --> 00:42:29,670
how to write your name differently!!

5037
00:42:29,870 --> 00:42:31,500
Saying you hate tomatoes but you like ketchup

5038
00:42:31,550 --> 00:42:34,010
And you dislike coffee but it's fine

5039
00:42:32,440 --> 00:42:34,010
As long as it's café au lait with plenty of milk

5040
00:42:34,220 --> 00:42:36,710
And when it comes to socks

5041
00:42:34,960 --> 00:42:36,710
You wear the same ones until they're worn out

5042
00:42:37,410 --> 00:42:39,810
Your skin looks like the bark on trees, you know?

5043
00:42:39,810 --> 00:42:39,930
Why don't you just announce the results of this!!

5044
00:42:39,810 --> 00:42:44,290
T/N: "Announcing the Results" is known as a phrase that Hamada says a lot on TV shows that he hosts

5045
00:42:39,950 --> 00:42:39,980
Why don't you just announce the results of this!!

5046
00:42:39,980 --> 00:42:40,010
Why don't you just announce the results of this!!

5047
00:42:40,010 --> 00:42:40,050
Why don't you just announce the results of this!!

5048
00:42:40,050 --> 00:42:40,080
Why don't you just announce the results of this!!

5049
00:42:40,080 --> 00:42:40,110
Why don't you just announce the results of this!!

5050
00:42:40,110 --> 00:42:44,290
Why don't you just announce the results of this!!

5051
00:42:41,420 --> 00:42:41,430
Say it!!

5052
00:42:41,430 --> 00:42:41,450
Say it!!

5053
00:42:41,450 --> 00:42:41,470
Say it!!

5054
00:42:41,470 --> 00:42:41,480
Say it!!

5055
00:42:41,480 --> 00:42:41,500
Say it!!

5056
00:42:41,500 --> 00:42:41,520
Say it!!

5057
00:42:41,520 --> 00:42:41,530
Say it!!

5058
00:42:41,530 --> 00:42:41,550
Say it!!

5059
00:42:41,550 --> 00:42:41,570
Say it!!

5060
00:42:41,570 --> 00:42:41,580
Say it!!

5061
00:42:41,580 --> 00:42:41,600
Say it!!

5062
00:42:41,600 --> 00:42:41,620
Say it!!

5063
00:42:41,620 --> 00:42:41,630
Say it!!

5064
00:42:41,630 --> 00:42:41,650
Say it!!

5065
00:42:41,650 --> 00:42:44,290
Say it!!

5066
00:42:47,770 --> 00:42:49,940
What, come on!!

5067
00:42:48,330 --> 00:42:50,190
A concentrated attack

5068
00:42:50,310 --> 00:42:50,930
Wow...

5069
00:42:54,130 --> 00:42:56,800
Excuse me, I got a little heated

5070
00:42:56,800 --> 00:42:58,770
Which reminds me, Endo

5071
00:42:58,770 --> 00:43:00,600
Last year, you did the "cheek-hitting-dance" on this program

5072
00:43:00,600 --> 00:43:04,370
Last year, you did the "cheek-hitting-dance" on this program

5073
00:43:02,440 --> 00:43:04,370
Thanks to that, becoming the talk of the town

5074
00:43:04,370 --> 00:43:08,210
You received some work for commercials

5075
00:43:06,210 --> 00:43:08,210
And earned quite a bit of small change, is that right?

5076
00:43:08,510 --> 00:43:09,910
Not a nice way to say it, but yes...

5077
00:43:09,910 --> 00:43:11,210
I wonder, could you show it to me this year, as well?

5078
00:43:11,210 --> 00:43:14,280
I wonder, could you show it to me this year, as well?

5079
00:43:16,120 --> 00:43:16,590
Here?

5080
00:43:19,120 --> 00:43:21,850
Do you know rhythm of the samba?

5081
00:43:22,050 --> 00:43:22,400
Yeah!

5082
00:43:22,400 --> 00:43:24,810
This year I'll do my best on New Year's Eve, as well!

5083
00:43:24,810 --> 00:43:26,010
Ah, ho-ho-hoi

5084
00:43:26,010 --> 00:43:28,220
Ho-ho-hoi, ho-ho-hoi-hoi

5085
00:43:28,220 --> 00:43:31,580
Ho-ho-hoi, ho-ho-hoi, ho-ho-hoi-hoi

5086
00:43:32,230 --> 00:43:33,600
Wonderful!!

5087
00:43:33,600 --> 00:43:35,840
It really is different seeing it live!!

5088
00:43:35,740 --> 00:43:36,360
Thank you

5089
00:43:36,170 --> 00:43:39,410
It's worth 1 million dollars

5090
00:43:37,550 --> 00:43:38,420
Oh, really?

5091
00:43:38,650 --> 00:43:39,410
Thanks

5092
00:43:45,550 --> 00:43:48,000
Hamada

5093
00:43:46,590 --> 00:43:47,430
Huh? Yes

5094
00:43:48,020 --> 00:43:51,020
I'd like to see yours, too

5095
00:43:49,530 --> 00:43:51,020
Wait a minute...

5096
00:43:53,130 --> 00:43:55,940
I haven't really done it before...

5097
00:43:56,960 --> 00:43:59,660
It's always me...

5098
00:43:58,510 --> 00:44:00,640
S-sorry. If you could do it, please

5099
00:44:04,120 --> 00:44:07,530
Do you know the rhythm of the samba?

5100
00:44:08,200 --> 00:44:13,990
Ho-ho-hoi, ho-ho-hoi, ho-ho-hoi-hoi. Ho-ho-hoi, ho-ho-hoi, ho-hoi!

5101
00:44:14,010 --> 00:44:14,020
Ah, that doesn't work at all!

5102
00:44:14,020 --> 00:44:14,040
Ah, that doesn't work at all!

5103
00:44:14,040 --> 00:44:14,060
Ah, that doesn't work at all!

5104
00:44:14,060 --> 00:44:14,070
Ah, that doesn't work at all!

5105
00:44:14,070 --> 00:44:14,090
Ah, that doesn't work at all!

5106
00:44:14,090 --> 00:44:14,110
Ah, that doesn't work at all!

5107
00:44:14,110 --> 00:44:14,120
Ah, that doesn't work at all!

5108
00:44:14,120 --> 00:44:14,140
Ah, that doesn't work at all!

5109
00:44:14,140 --> 00:44:14,160
Ah, that doesn't work at all!

5110
00:44:14,160 --> 00:44:14,170
Ah, that doesn't work at all!

5111
00:44:14,170 --> 00:44:14,190
Ah, that doesn't work at all!

5112
00:44:14,190 --> 00:44:14,210
Ah, that doesn't work at all!

5113
00:44:14,210 --> 00:44:14,220
Ah, that doesn't work at all!

5114
00:44:14,220 --> 00:44:14,240
Ah, that doesn't work at all!

5115
00:44:14,240 --> 00:44:17,180
Ah, that doesn't work at all!

5116
00:44:15,910 --> 00:44:17,180
The awkwardness is showing!

5117
00:44:17,710 --> 00:44:18,210
"Money, come. Money, come"

5118
00:44:18,210 --> 00:44:20,650
"Money, come. Money, come"

5119
00:44:18,850 --> 00:44:20,650
Imagine it's a commercial and do it

5120
00:44:21,000 --> 00:44:24,320
wages

5121
00:44:21,930 --> 00:44:24,320
wages

5122
00:44:22,700 --> 00:44:24,320
wages

5123
00:44:23,070 --> 00:44:24,320
wages

5124
00:44:24,330 --> 00:44:28,090
wages

5125
00:44:25,200 --> 00:44:28,090
wages

5126
00:44:25,900 --> 00:44:28,090

00:48:46,110 --> 00:48:47,920
1 novemdecillion

5318
00:48:47,920 --> 00:48:49,380
I have no idea what that number is

5319
00:48:49,880 --> 00:48:51,890

00:48:51,890 --> 00:48:55,690

5321
00:48:53,420 --> 00:48:54,300
Novemdecillion?

5322
00:48:53,920 --> 00:48:55,690
You've won...

5323
00:48:54,980 --> 00:48:55,840
It's settled!

5324
00:48:55,840 --> 00:48:59,490
The Hamaata has been sold for 1 vigintillion

5325
00:48:57,260 --> 00:49:01,230
The 1 vigintillion bid for "Hamaata" has been accepted

5326
00:49:03,260 --> 00:49:04,250
No, no, no

5327
00:49:04,570 --> 00:49:06,290
Do such numerical units actually exist?

5328
00:49:11,870 --> 00:49:13,240
President Maezawa...

5329
00:49:13,240 --> 00:49:17,240
We really don't have any money

5330
00:49:19,450 --> 00:49:21,110
Mr. Matsumoto

5331
00:49:20,320 --> 00:49:20,910
Yes?

5332
00:49:21,110 --> 00:49:21,820
You see...

5333
00:49:21,980 --> 00:49:24,120
Your book "Isho" sold really well

5334
00:49:22,820 --> 00:49:23,310
Hm

5335
00:49:24,120 --> 00:49:27,790
I've heard that you received a lot of royalties

5336
00:49:26,270 --> 00:49:27,210
Yeah, yeah...

5337
00:49:26,270 --> 00:49:27,650
No, no...

5338
00:49:28,220 --> 00:49:30,590
Could you please lend me about 1 novemdecillion...

5339
00:49:30,870 --> 00:49:33,230
As if!!

5340
00:49:33,230 --> 00:49:35,500
It's the first time I've ever heard of that numerical unit!!

5341
00:49:43,530 --> 00:49:44,720
I don't have that

5342
00:49:44,140 --> 00:49:45,690
Mr. Hamada

5343
00:49:44,880 --> 00:49:45,620
Yes?

5344
00:49:45,700 --> 00:49:46,510
You see...

5345
00:49:46,510 --> 00:49:49,680
Way back when, I listened to "WOW WAR TONIGHT" a lot

5346
00:49:47,540 --> 00:49:48,130
Yeah

5347
00:49:48,990 --> 00:49:50,080
Thank you!!

5348
00:49:49,680 --> 00:49:52,050
I heard you received a lot of royalties

5349
00:49:51,050 --> 00:49:52,040
Oh no, not at all

5350
00:49:52,380 --> 00:49:55,480
Please lend me around ten quadrillion

5351
00:49:53,430 --> 00:49:55,430
I don't have that

5352
00:49:55,720 --> 00:49:57,300
I don't have that

5353
00:50:02,930 --> 00:50:04,600
Come on...

5354
00:50:08,160 --> 00:50:09,460
President Maezawa

5355
00:50:09,460 --> 00:50:12,170
You're being indecent. Please stop it

5356
00:50:13,570 --> 00:50:16,770
"The Hamaata" is so ugly

5357
00:50:15,850 --> 00:50:17,100
That's so cold

5358
00:50:20,770 --> 00:50:22,770
Good for him

5359
00:50:26,480 --> 00:50:28,720
The grand paupers of the world really are incredible

5360
00:50:29,310 --> 00:50:31,650
Why did you participate?

5361
00:50:29,310 --> 00:50:31,650
Why did you...?

5362
00:50:29,660 --> 00:50:31,650
Why did you start bidding?

5363
00:50:31,650 --> 00:50:32,860
L-let's go!

5364
00:50:32,860 --> 00:50:34,760
You were jacking the price up...

5365
00:50:36,320 --> 00:50:38,990

Next, the 5 of them will be specially allowed

The Show's Rehearsal

5370

To sit in on the rehearsal of tomorrow's show

5371
00:50:46,690 --> 00:50:48,790
They're about to do a rehearsal, you see

5372
00:50:48,810 --> 00:50:50,710
Is it okay for us to watch?

5373
00:50:48,810 --> 00:50:50,710
We get to see it?

5374
00:50:51,870 --> 00:50:53,610
We'd prefer to see the real show

5375
00:50:53,610 --> 00:50:55,610
Right? We would prefer the real show

5376
00:50:55,610 --> 00:50:57,610
Will you get seated over there?

5377
00:50:58,590 --> 00:51:02,910
Ah, but we're getting prime seats...

5378
00:50:59,790 --> 00:51:02,910
But getting to see a show in Las Vegas is pretty great

5379
00:51:03,520 --> 00:51:04,760
It's quite neat to get to watch alone like this

5380
00:51:04,760 --> 00:51:07,850
It's quite neat to get to watch alone like this

5381
00:51:07,850 --> 00:51:09,850
Well then, please watch the rehearsal closely

5382
00:51:12,940 --> 00:51:17,900
The Rehearsal Begins

In this old bar

5393
00:51:27,450 --> 00:51:31,450
I've had so much to drink

5394
00:51:32,750 --> 00:51:39,710
Also popular in Las Vegas!! The staple performance of shooting beans

5395
00:51:32,760 --> 00:51:39,710
T/N: Yoshiaki Umegaki has been doing this skit of shooting beans out of his nose to this song while dressed in drag for several years.

5396
00:51:33,360 --> 00:51:38,530
My old memories all start to blur

5397
00:51:34,010 --> 00:51:37,110
It's been a while since I saw this!

5398
00:51:37,680 --> 00:51:39,220
It has

5399
00:51:38,530 --> 00:51:41,200
My lover has left me

5400
00:51:41,200 --> 00:51:42,720
My lover has left me

5401
00:51:42,720 --> 00:51:44,530
My lover has left me

5402
00:51:45,170 --> 00:51:52,410
People call me notorious

5403
00:51:52,410 --> 00:51:54,410
Good for nothing

5404
00:51:54,410 --> 00:51:56,410
Amazing!

5405
00:51:56,410 --> 00:51:58,950
Good for nothing

5406
00:51:59,180 --> 00:52:03,640
What a harsh thing to say

5407
00:52:05,550 --> 00:52:07,870
Good for nothing

5408
00:52:07,890 --> 00:52:09,850
That's so irritating

5409
00:52:09,850 --> 00:52:10,720
Good for nothing

5410
00:52:10,720 --> 00:52:13,250
There really are so many ways to shoot them

5411
00:52:12,150 --> 00:52:13,250
For real!

5412
00:52:13,250 --> 00:52:17,950
What a harsh thing to say

5413
00:52:20,200 --> 00:52:21,510
That came flying at us

5414
00:52:20,200 --> 00:52:21,760
Thank you so much for coming today

5415
00:52:22,300 --> 00:52:26,960
I will now introduce you to a young apprentice of mine

5416
00:52:24,490 --> 00:52:26,130
Eh? Who?

5417
00:52:27,740 --> 00:52:31,440

Goro, you don't have to...

5424
00:52:38,560 --> 00:52:43,890
My old memories all start to blur

5425
00:52:39,450 --> 00:52:45,480
Carrying on the staple performance of shooting beans

5426
00:52:41,860 --> 00:52:45,480
You should just stop!

5427
00:52:45,950 --> 00:52:48,590
My lover has left me

5428
00:52:47,390 --> 00:52:48,620
They don't fly at all!

5429
00:52:47,790 --> 00:52:48,620

5431
00:52:50,860 --> 00:52:53,040
We're saying you should just stop

5432
00:52:58,290 --> 00:53:01,050
Good for nothing

5433
00:53:02,210 --> 00:53:04,490
Good for nothing

5434
00:53:05,430 --> 00:53:08,340
What a harsh thing to say

5435
00:53:06,680 --> 00:53:08,340
What is that?

5436
00:53:08,340 --> 00:53:11,230
What a harsh thing to say

5437
00:53:13,550 --> 00:53:15,830
Applause!

5438
00:53:15,830 --> 00:53:17,830
Incredible

5439
00:53:16,710 --> 00:53:18,990
We get it, but...

5440
00:53:28,810 --> 00:53:30,710
Dragging out what happened last year...

5441
00:53:30,790 --> 00:53:32,670
Ah, everyone here today

5442
00:53:32,670 --> 00:53:35,800
Thank you for coming and watching this rehearsal

5446
00:53:44,710 --> 00:53:47,470
Well, please make the preparations!

Demonstration of a planned act for tomorrow's show

5448
00:53:48,680 --> 00:53:51,590
I'm still not sure if I should do it or not

5449
00:53:51,590 --> 00:53:52,550
What?

5450
00:53:52,550 --> 00:53:54,790
I want you all to participate

5451
00:53:54,860 --> 00:54:01,960
Planned act for tomorrow's show

5452
00:53:54,860 --> 00:54:01,960
Tissue and a Party Blower will be used

5453
00:53:54,870 --> 00:53:59,510
Firstly we have this tissue. Matsumoto...

5454
00:53:59,530 --> 00:54:01,960
...Please hold this tissue box for me

5455
00:54:01,110 --> 00:54:01,960
Sure thing

5456
00:54:01,970 --> 00:54:03,610
Please stand on these steps

5457
00:54:03,610 --> 00:54:04,110
Okay

5458
00:54:04,160 --> 00:54:07,710
I want you to gently drop one tissue from up there

5459
00:54:04,160 --> 00:54:10,400
1: Release one tissue from the top of the steps

5460

00:54:07,730 --> 00:54:08,830
You got it

5462
00:54:08,830 --> 00:54:10,400
Then I will be using this

5463
00:54:10,400 --> 00:54:13,600
Party blower to catch it

5464
00:54:13,670 --> 00:54:20,810

00:54:15,500 --> 00:54:16,450
You're going to roll it up?

5467
00:54:16,450 --> 00:54:17,680
We're going to roll it, yeah

5468
00:54:17,680 --> 00:54:20,810
Please give us a round of applause if we pull it off

5469
00:54:20,810 --> 00:54:23,150
Now, Matsumoto, if you will...

5470
00:54:20,830 --> 00:54:22,670
If you can pull it off

5471
00:54:23,150 --> 00:54:25,150
Even this makes me tense...

5473
00:54:35,730 --> 00:54:36,720

5474
00:54:36,760 --> 00:54:38,450
You didn't catch it at all...

5475
00:54:38,170 --> 00:54:39,950
You were... Kinda close, though

5476
00:54:39,980 --> 00:54:41,160
Close is a bit...

5477
00:54:39,980 --> 00:54:43,970
I'm not sure I would call it close...

5478
00:54:43,980 --> 00:54:45,970
I guess it was mostly me

5479
00:54:43,980 --> 00:54:50,040
A problem with the tissue drop?

5480
00:54:45,980 --> 00:54:49,010
That's right. The way you released it was problematic

5481
00:54:49,010 --> 00:54:49,950
I'll try one more time

5482
00:54:50,050 --> 00:54:50,890
I'm counting on you!

5483
00:54:57,550 --> 00:55:01,350

5484
00:54:57,550 --> 00:55:01,350
I'm so sorry!

5485
00:55:01,350 --> 00:55:05,800
It fell over towards me, the tissue. I wonder if I'm the problem

5486
00:55:06,170 --> 00:55:11,330
Small chance of pulling it off in front of an audience

5487
00:55:08,070 --> 00:55:10,030
Do you have any other ideas?

5488
00:55:11,600 --> 00:55:14,500
Matsumoto, I would like you to try

5489
00:55:12,260 --> 00:55:14,500
Really?

5490
00:55:14,840 --> 00:55:16,690
Hosei, please drop the tissue

5491
00:55:14,840 --> 00:55:21,400
Matsumoto will try to catch the tissue

5492
00:55:17,470 --> 00:55:18,770
Don't screw this up, now

5493
00:55:18,770 --> 00:55:20,910
Understood, here I go

5494
00:55:19,150 --> 00:55:20,150
Drop it straight

5495
00:55:24,670 --> 00:55:28,650
SUCCESS

5496
00:55:25,350 --> 00:55:26,690
Incredible!

5497
00:55:26,690 --> 00:55:28,640
That felt nice!

5498
00:55:27,870 --> 00:55:28,640
The best till now

5499
00:55:31,870 --> 00:55:34,890
What, only me!? Everyone's laughing!

5500
00:55:35,000 --> 00:55:36,890
That was perfect

5501
00:55:35,530 --> 00:55:38,460
Everyone was very pleased with this

5502
00:55:38,460 --> 00:55:38,990
Beautiful

5503
00:55:38,990 --> 00:55:40,990
That was really something

5504
00:55:39,500 --> 00:55:40,890
Truly beautiful

5505
00:55:40,890 --> 00:55:41,640
Amazing

5506
00:55:41,010 --> 00:55:44,010
Thank you so much!

5507
00:55:42,810 --> 00:55:44,020
Thank you

5508
00:55:44,040 --> 00:55:48,270
Tomorrow's Las Vegas show will be a huge hit

5509
00:55:49,530 --> 00:55:50,770
Wait, you wanna do it?

5510
00:55:50,770 --> 00:55:53,090
Let us continue the show!

5511
00:55:51,160 --> 00:55:59,960
Good for nothing

5512
00:55:51,160 --> 00:55:59,960
~ Goro Inagaki - Resolution to Hardships ~

5513
00:56:00,210 --> 00:56:06,790
Last year, I persevered with my out of character act

5514
00:56:06,830 --> 00:56:13,530
I entertained you all with my vulgar jokes

5515
00:56:13,600 --> 00:56:20,130
My long time fans have now gotten tired and given up on me

5516
00:56:20,130 --> 00:56:27,270
Though Gaki seems pleased, my popularity will plummet yet again

5517
00:56:27,510 --> 00:56:33,910
It's my Johnson. It's my Johnson

5518
00:56:34,000 --> 00:56:40,590
My bulging groin swells up again

5519
00:56:40,600 --> 00:56:42,890
Inagaki's little...

5520
00:56:41,470 --> 00:56:42,890
Oy oy oy!

5521
00:56:43,830 --> 00:56:50,430
Mini-Inagaki emerges from the groin

5522
00:56:43,830 --> 00:56:53,700
Mini-Inagaki erupts between the legs

5523
00:56:46,570 --> 00:56:48,210
The lips are articulating!

5524
00:56:54,220 --> 00:57:00,570
It's Inagaki's little Inagaki!

5525
00:56:55,770 --> 00:56:57,770
The lips are moving to the lyrics!

5526
00:57:00,650 --> 00:57:06,650
All my fans out there, are you watching!?

5527
00:57:07,440 --> 00:57:13,850
It's Inagaki's little Inagaki!

5528
00:57:10,290 --> 00:57:11,750
This is something

5529
00:57:12,790 --> 00:57:14,850
"It's Inagak's little Inagaki"...

5530
00:57:13,980 --> 00:57:20,690
All that becomes popular is filthy

5531
00:57:21,370 --> 00:57:23,530
Thank you so much for today!

5532
00:57:22,970 --> 00:57:23,540
Well...

5533
00:57:23,540 --> 00:57:27,430
This gave me strength and confidence for the real thing tomorrow

5534
00:57:28,140 --> 00:57:29,140
Everyone please keep enjoying Las Vegas!

5535
00:57:29,140 --> 00:57:33,040
Everyone please keep enjoying Las Vegas!

5536
00:57:33,510 --> 00:57:35,280
See you next year!!

5537
00:57:36,270 --> 00:57:39,300
La la lala laaa

5538
00:57:39,330 --> 00:57:41,330
You piss me off!

5539
00:57:43,330 --> 00:57:46,250
Of course his popularity plummets

5540
00:57:46,250 --> 00:57:49,170
Inagaki's little Inagaki moved a lot

5541
00:57:52,870 --> 00:57:55,760
Amazing rehearsal...

5542
00:57:55,760 --> 00:57:58,190
What a copeless performance

5543
00:57:57,450 --> 00:57:58,330
What?

5544
00:57:58,190 --> 00:58:00,170
What a hopeless performance

5545
00:58:00,170 --> 00:58:01,150
Let's get going

5546
00:58:02,650 --> 00:58:08,610
The Assassins of Laughter will keep on dealing blows

5547
00:58:06,940 --> 00:58:08,610
That really surprised me

5548
00:58:08,610 --> 00:58:15,510
Chidori messes up big time!

5549
00:58:16,010 --> 00:58:18,920
Without even a second to rest

5550
00:58:16,010 --> 00:58:21,390
5 hours into their ordeal

5551
00:58:19,110 --> 00:58:21,390
The next shots are fired by the assassins of laughter

5552
00:58:21,640 --> 00:58:28,290
The hotel's basement corridor

5553
00:58:22,130 --> 00:58:25,790
The five can finally explore that room

5554
00:58:25,790 --> 00:58:27,310
Everyone, let's go

5555
00:58:27,310 --> 00:58:29,790
We were never told where we're going

5556
00:58:30,210 --> 00:58:31,290
It's here

5557
00:58:30,210 --> 00:58:32,490
Ah! I see

5558
00:58:32,490 --> 00:58:34,290
I see...

5559
00:58:32,710 --> 00:58:37,940
Waiting room

5560
00:58:34,290 --> 00:58:37,930
So it's here again

5561
00:58:37,940 --> 00:58:41,210
This is where you'll start your Las Vegas dream life

5562
00:58:41,210 --> 00:58:42,230
Would you take a seat

5563
00:58:43,530 --> 00:58:44,190
Sure

5564
00:58:45,990 --> 00:58:46,690
Sit down

5565
00:58:48,690 --> 00:58:50,690
This is how it is, huh

5566
00:58:51,510 --> 00:58:53,330
Of course, of course

5567
00:58:53,330 --> 00:58:54,950
There's no mistake

5568
00:58:55,330 --> 00:58:55,950
Yes yes yes

5569
00:58:57,030 --> 00:59:00,760
Here at the Omamett Hotel

5570
00:58:58,690 --> 00:59:00,760
Doing anything will require money from you

5571
00:59:01,400 --> 00:59:03,400
There is a price list over there

5572
00:59:03,400 --> 00:59:05,400

1000 Heipo

6650
00:59:10,780 --> 00:59:12,370
Please take care of it

6651
00:59:10,780 --> 00:59:12,370
Thank you

6652
00:59:10,780 --> 00:59:15,810
Doing anything requires money

Initial funds of 20,000 Heipo

6654
00:59:12,370 --> 00:59:13,470
Really?

6655
00:59:13,470 --> 00:59:14,970
20,000 Heipo...

6656
00:59:14,970 --> 00:59:15,810
Wow, it's expensive

6658

6659
00:59:20,930 --> 00:59:22,670
Everything costs money

6660
00:59:22,750 --> 00:59:24,070
So please understand

6661
00:59:25,130 --> 00:59:31,790
If you use any of your money

6662
00:59:26,560 --> 00:59:31,790
Would you please put it in this box?

6663
00:59:31,790 --> 00:59:34,070
Oh right. Until now we just took what we wanted

6664
00:59:34,390 --> 00:59:37,190

I'll have a water

6691
00:59:42,910 --> 00:59:44,050
You're paying already?

6692
00:59:44,100 --> 00:59:45,430
I'm also a bit thirsty

6693
00:59:46,010 --> 00:59:48,630
It's not like I can't keep going without a drink of water

6694
00:59:48,130 --> 00:59:49,170
You're right

6695
00:59:53,890 --> 00:59:55,680
Wouldn't be as bad if we got a bottle of water

6696
00:59:55,230 --> 00:59:55,680
Indeed

6697
00:59:55,680 --> 00:59:57,880

00:59:57,900 --> 01:00:00,010
You just get one of anything

6722
01:00:00,010 --> 01:00:02,010
Exactly

6723
01:00:00,950 --> 01:00:01,470
Yeah

6724
01:00:01,490 --> 01:00:02,190
Indeed

6725
01:00:02,360 --> 01:00:05,270
When something requires money

6726
01:00:07,300 --> 01:00:09,260
I have to drink up every last drop

6727
01:00:07,300 --> 01:00:09,260
It feels like

6728
01:00:09,260 --> 01:00:11,860
"You only get this one precious cup"

6729
01:00:10,790 --> 01:00:11,330
Yup

6730
01:00:12,930 --> 01:00:17,030
So we have to use our money...

6731
01:00:18,760 --> 01:00:19,550
He said to take care of it

6732
01:00:19,550 --> 01:00:23,430
So I guess there will be a time to use it later?

6733
01:00:23,450 --> 01:00:26,650
Other than on this

6734
01:00:26,650 --> 01:00:29,320
We'll probably be doing casino games

6735
01:00:27,550 --> 01:00:29,790
Right! That's when we will use this

6736
01:00:29,360 --> 01:00:31,510
You're probably right

6737
01:00:31,510 --> 01:00:32,690
Placing bets...

6738
01:00:32,690 --> 01:00:34,180
Wouldn't want to be broke, then

6739
01:00:34,380 --> 01:00:35,700
You're right

6740
01:00:35,700 --> 01:00:37,610
Ah, Tanaka, there was a rumor about you

6741
01:00:37,610 --> 01:00:41,270
A backstage robbery

6742
01:00:38,530 --> 01:00:39,050
Eh?

6743
01:00:39,050 --> 01:00:39,800
Backstage thief

6744
01:00:39,800 --> 01:00:41,270
Backstage thief

6745
01:00:40,480 --> 01:00:41,270
You can't be serious!

6746
01:00:41,270 --> 01:00:43,800
I did no such thing

6747
01:00:42,250 --> 01:00:43,800
No, there was this one time...

6748
01:00:43,800 --> 01:00:46,620
Where a security camera caught a glimpse of...

6749
01:00:46,600 --> 01:00:49,470
Where a security camera caught a glimpse of...

6750
01:00:54,700 --> 01:00:57,520
Hold on. That's absurd!

6751
01:00:55,210 --> 01:00:56,560
Come on!

6752
01:00:57,520 --> 01:00:59,530
What the hell!

6753
01:00:58,540 --> 01:00:59,980
That never happened!

6754
01:00:59,980 --> 01:01:02,650
What did they catch a glimpse of?

6755
01:01:02,580 --> 01:01:03,460
Ouch!

6756
01:01:03,460 --> 01:01:05,180
Those are some scary accusations

6757
01:01:04,710 --> 01:01:07,730
They couldn't say for certain it was Tanaka...

6758
01:01:07,730 --> 01:01:09,740
It can't have been me

6759
01:01:09,750 --> 01:01:11,240
No, I'm telling you...

6760
01:01:10,400 --> 01:01:12,260
Just keep telling us those lies

6761
01:01:12,260 --> 01:01:13,210
From this year on, I'll seriously come punch you

6762
01:01:13,190 --> 01:01:16,890
From this year on, I'll seriously come punch you

6763
01:01:14,660 --> 01:01:16,430
You'll come punch him...

6764
01:01:17,740 --> 01:01:21,930
Can you please stop?

6765
01:01:19,660 --> 01:01:22,180
What are you saying?

6766
01:01:21,930 --> 01:01:23,930
That's going too far

6767
01:01:24,900 --> 01:01:25,970
Go punch him?

6768
01:01:28,910 --> 01:01:30,810
What a slap

6769
01:01:29,290 --> 01:01:33,440
They got a direct hit to my exposed back!

6770
01:01:33,440 --> 01:01:36,280
Can we please stop?

6771
01:01:36,450 --> 01:01:39,180
This has nothing to do with anything

6772
01:01:37,660 --> 01:01:39,180
Yeah

6773
01:01:39,180 --> 01:01:40,920
Stealing money, violence...

6774
01:01:40,920 --> 01:01:43,550
We're talking about nothing but illegal activities

6775
01:01:41,630 --> 01:01:43,550
Right right

6776
01:01:43,550 --> 01:01:46,720
This isn't happy at all

6777
01:01:44,790 --> 01:01:46,720
Can I butt in for a moment?

6778
01:01:46,720 --> 01:01:47,420
At this time

6779
01:01:47,420 --> 01:01:50,060
We usually do the drawers

6780
01:01:50,060 --> 01:01:54,000
We usually do the drawers

6781
01:01:51,290 --> 01:01:52,430
I forgot

6782
01:01:51,950 --> 01:01:52,750
Ah!

6783
01:01:54,000 --> 01:01:56,170
There's no reason not to, right?

6784
01:01:54,900 --> 01:01:56,370
Shall we get to pulling?

6785
01:01:56,430 --> 01:01:56,980
Shall we start?

6786
01:01:57,200 --> 01:01:58,670
Shall we start?

6787
01:01:59,140 --> 01:02:01,140
Should we start with Tanaka?

6788
01:02:01,500 --> 01:02:04,020
We usually start with me

6789
01:02:02,820 --> 01:02:04,820
That's right. You wanna go?

6790
01:02:02,840 --> 01:02:03,440
Yes

6791
01:02:03,820 --> 01:02:04,620
Yes

6792
01:02:04,820 --> 01:02:05,610
Sure

6793
01:02:05,610 --> 01:02:08,810
Ahh, here we go again...

6794
01:02:05,610 --> 01:02:10,760
This year's top batter is Tanaka

6795
01:02:08,810 --> 01:02:10,760
Yep, it's a DVD

6796
01:02:10,760 --> 01:02:13,880
It's a DVD pretty much every year

6797
01:02:12,230 --> 01:02:17,190
I noticed the DVD player right away...

6798
01:02:14,280 --> 01:02:17,490
DVD Player

Oh, right!

6801
01:02:16,820 --> 01:02:18,460
Here I go

6802
01:02:20,090 --> 01:02:22,490
Nothing

6803
01:02:26,130 --> 01:02:28,700
Nothing

6804
01:02:26,850 --> 01:02:27,110
Eh?

6805
01:02:27,110 --> 01:02:28,550
Nothing?

6806
01:02:28,700 --> 01:02:29,650
What, nothing?

6807
01:02:29,300 --> 01:02:29,600
Yep

6808
01:02:32,700 --> 01:02:32,720
Nothing!!

6809
01:02:32,720 --> 01:02:32,740
Nothing!!

6810
01:02:32,740 --> 01:02:32,750
Nothing!!

6811
01:02:32,750 --> 01:02:32,770
Nothing!!

6812
01:02:32,770 --> 01:02:32,790
Nothing!!

6813
01:02:32,790 --> 01:02:32,800
Nothing!!

6814
01:02:32,800 --> 01:02:32,820
Nothing!!

6815
01:02:32,820 --> 01:02:32,840
Nothing!!

6816
01:02:32,840 --> 01:02:32,850
Nothing!!

6817
01:02:32,850 --> 01:02:32,870
Nothing!!

6818
01:02:32,870 --> 01:02:32,890
Nothing!!

6819
01:02:32,890 --> 01:02:32,900
Nothing!!

6820
01:02:32,900 --> 01:02:32,920
Nothing!!

6821
01:02:32,920 --> 01:02:32,940
Nothing!!

6822
01:02:32,940 --> 01:02:35,940
Nothing!!

6823
01:02:33,790 --> 01:02:35,440
Nothing?

6824
01:02:35,940 --> 01:02:41,080
Tanaka's desk is completely empty

6825
01:02:36,590 --> 01:02:38,370
There's nothing here!

6826
01:02:38,370 --> 01:02:39,890
Could they be empty today?

6827
01:02:39,890 --> 01:02:41,080
Maybe they're empty this time!

6828
01:02:39,890 --> 01:02:41,080
This year

6829
01:02:41,440 --> 01:02:43,450
Open yours, Matsumoto

6830
01:02:43,450 --> 01:02:45,820
They might all be empty this year

6831
01:02:45,820 --> 01:02:47,930
I see

6832
01:02:46,470 --> 01:02:47,930
Maybe

6833
01:02:48,490 --> 01:02:49,920
Nothing!!

6834
01:02:50,290 --> 01:02:53,460
For real!?

6835
01:02:51,450 --> 01:02:54,420
But isn't that okay? Changing it up a bit

6836
01:02:53,460 --> 01:02:55,960
But then it'll be scary if I'm the only one

6837
01:02:55,040 --> 01:02:55,960
Well, well

6838
01:02:56,790 --> 01:02:59,260
Ah, damnit! There's something here...

6839
01:03:00,150 --> 01:03:01,500
There's a letter there

6840
01:03:02,900 --> 01:03:04,880
This is different

6841
01:03:02,900 --> 01:03:08,300
Mysterious envelope

6842
01:03:08,390 --> 01:03:09,290
Hmm?

6843
01:03:10,760 --> 01:03:19,680
Chance to get a funny item

6844
01:03:10,760 --> 01:03:19,680
m 378 829.5 l 1272 829.5 1272 904.5 378 904.5

6845
01:03:10,760 --> 01:03:19,680
m 378 915 l 1555.5 915 1555.5 991.5 378 991.5

6846
01:03:13,840 --> 01:03:19,680
1,000 Heipo Gacha, anyone can try

6847
01:03:13,840 --> 01:03:19,680
T/N: The original meaning of gacha is those machines where you put in coins, turn the knob, and you get a random prize.

6848
01:03:16,810 --> 01:03:19,680
Ah, this letter isn't really specifically for me

6849
01:03:19,680 --> 01:03:21,130
It's this, isn't it?

6850
01:03:21,130 --> 01:03:24,090
This is just the instructions for the funny item gacha

6851
01:03:24,450 --> 01:03:27,720
Well then, Matsumoto should be the first one to try, right?

6852
01:03:28,990 --> 01:03:31,460
But I just used 1,000 Heipo on a cup of water

6853
01:03:31,730 --> 01:03:34,630
You still have a lot there

6854
01:03:35,600 --> 01:03:39,200
I'm the only one using up 2,000 Heipo?

6855
01:03:39,200 --> 01:03:42,140
We'll do it afterwards

6856
01:03:40,550 --> 01:03:43,070
Yes, we're doing it too

6857
01:03:42,140 --> 01:03:44,140
We'll watch you, then do it

6858
01:03:43,510 --> 01:03:44,160
We all will

6859
01:03:44,160 --> 01:03:45,020
Yes

6860
01:03:44,160 --> 01:03:45,430
Yes, yes, yes

6861
01:03:47,080 --> 01:03:48,850
Huh!?

6862
01:03:48,730 --> 01:03:50,030
Then I turn this?

6863
01:03:50,380 --> 01:03:52,070
Yeah

6864
01:03:50,710 --> 01:03:52,420
Here!!

6865
01:03:52,700 --> 01:03:53,930
H-here!

6866
01:03:53,230 --> 01:03:53,930
You put it here!

6867
01:03:53,930 --> 01:03:55,690
Ah, you poor thing!

6868
01:03:55,690 --> 01:03:56,890
What a waste!

6869
01:03:55,690 --> 01:03:56,890
You have to pay another 1,000 Heipo

6870
01:03:57,500 --> 01:03:58,420
Wrong place

6871
01:03:58,420 --> 01:04:02,930
You have to pay another 1,000 Heipo!

6872
01:04:00,260 --> 01:04:02,930
Why are you laughing?

6873
01:04:03,890 --> 01:04:05,900
Ah, it doesn't go in the money box

6874
01:04:04,890 --> 01:04:08,830
Of course it doesn't

6875
01:04:11,070 --> 01:04:13,170
People messing up tickles him the most

6876
01:04:13,170 --> 01:04:17,270
That's my least favorite laugh

6877
01:04:14,550 --> 01:04:17,270
I too dislike that laugh

6878
01:04:18,020 --> 01:04:22,410
The way he said "Ah, you poor thing!"

6879
01:04:18,020 --> 01:04:22,410
The way he said "Ah, you poor thing!"

6880
01:04:20,540 --> 01:04:22,560
He's really laughing

6881
01:04:21,380 --> 01:04:22,550
Isn't that messed up?

6882
01:04:22,410 --> 01:04:24,650
That was something

6883
01:04:23,110 --> 01:04:23,860
Right!?

6884
01:04:24,650 --> 01:04:27,120
I was laughing because Hamada couldn't hold himself

6885
01:04:27,120 --> 01:04:27,680
Why?

6886
01:04:27,680 --> 01:04:29,690
The way he went "Heee!" from "you poor thing!"

6887
01:04:30,250 --> 01:04:31,050
That was funny?

6888
01:04:31,050 --> 01:04:35,530
Yeah, tat was fenny

6889
01:04:35,530 --> 01:04:39,060
That's ridiculous!

6890
01:04:39,450 --> 01:04:43,400
This instruction letter is screwed up! Write it properly!

6891
01:04:44,330 --> 01:04:45,970
Of course we'd use the box!!

6892
01:04:48,560 --> 01:04:49,640
That might be...

6893
01:04:49,710 --> 01:04:52,480
Nothing we can do about that now, you have to put it in here

6894
01:04:52,480 --> 01:04:55,950
You have no choice, but to use another 1,000 Heipo

6895
01:04:53,710 --> 01:04:55,950
You might win more money later on

6896
01:04:55,950 --> 01:04:59,320
I'm the only one going bankrupt here

6897
01:04:56,610 --> 01:04:59,320
I'm the only one going bankrupt here

6898
01:04:59,320 --> 01:05:01,720
But it says to insert money right here

6899
01:05:01,720 --> 01:05:03,050
You can't be serious...

6900
01:05:04,040 --> 01:05:05,310
Here, right?

6901
01:05:05,310 --> 01:05:06,870
Right. See there it goes!

6902
01:05:06,710 --> 01:05:08,220
It really went in there

6903
01:05:07,270 --> 01:05:08,270
That's right

6904
01:05:08,270 --> 01:05:09,660
It went in like zoom!

6905
01:05:09,690 --> 01:05:10,260
Then

6906
01:05:11,490 --> 01:05:12,650
I wonder what it is

6907
01:05:13,730 --> 01:05:15,530
It'll be an item, right?

6908
01:05:14,560 --> 01:05:16,000
It's an item

6909
01:05:16,000 --> 01:05:20,400
Going by the gold color it must be something good

6910
01:05:17,270 --> 01:05:20,400
Going by the gold color it must be something good

6911
01:05:18,470 --> 01:05:19,470
It looks good

6912
01:05:24,860 --> 01:05:25,640
Is it usable?

6913
01:05:25,640 --> 01:05:29,110
Key number 5

6914
01:05:26,460 --> 01:05:28,900
It's like this, huh

6915
01:05:28,900 --> 01:05:30,100
I see!

6916
01:05:30,100 --> 01:05:32,070
So that's where the keys are

6917
01:05:30,750 --> 01:05:36,050
Numbered lockers

6918
01:05:30,750 --> 01:05:36,050
m 111 856.5 l 913.5 855 913.5 960 111 960

6919
01:05:32,280 --> 01:05:36,050
There's a lot of them

6920
01:05:32,380 --> 01:05:36,050
This makes it all so much more cumbersome...

6921
01:05:36,050 --> 01:05:39,060
You pay, then get to open a locker

6922
01:05:39,290 --> 01:05:41,860
Who gets to open what is completely random

6923
01:05:40,120 --> 01:05:41,860
You're right

6924
01:05:41,860 --> 01:05:43,840
I don't like this...

6925
01:05:49,570 --> 01:05:50,780
Is it something good?

6926
01:05:52,140 --> 01:05:53,350
Funny glasses

6927
01:05:55,200 --> 01:05:57,470
"With these even you can widen your view"

6928
01:05:57,610 --> 01:06:00,040
Even if he uses them on us...

6929
01:06:00,040 --> 01:06:02,550
We don't know if they will be favorable or not

6930
01:06:01,340 --> 01:06:02,680
Indeed

6931
01:06:01,380 --> 01:06:02,560
Right

6932
01:06:02,680 --> 01:06:03,960
"Widen my view"?

6933
01:06:04,460 --> 01:06:06,620
You noticed quickly, Yama-chan

6934
01:06:13,920 --> 01:06:16,210
So that's how it's gonna be, huh

6935
01:06:15,930 --> 01:06:17,890
Your eyes are wide open

6936
01:06:18,290 --> 01:06:20,800
Is my view really widened by these?

6937
01:06:21,610 --> 01:06:24,180
My view hasn't widened at all

6938
01:06:23,500 --> 01:06:24,480
Maybe let Hamada try?

6939
01:06:24,480 --> 01:06:25,920
They might work wonders for him

6940
01:06:25,900 --> 01:06:29,040
These could be intended for Hamada

6941
01:06:26,400 --> 01:06:26,870
No no no

6942
01:06:26,870 --> 01:06:29,710
If Hamada isn't funny with them on then...

6943
01:06:29,710 --> 01:06:32,110
They won't work for any of us

6944
01:06:36,410 --> 01:06:37,180
What the...

6945
01:06:37,960 --> 01:06:38,830
The mouth

6946
01:06:39,620 --> 01:06:40,580
Hamada...

6947
01:06:41,270 --> 01:06:42,050
Your mouth

6948
01:06:43,320 --> 01:06:46,270
Incredible

6949
01:06:43,590 --> 01:06:45,570
This guy's strong

6950
01:06:46,710 --> 01:06:47,470
Really strong

6951
01:06:47,620 --> 01:06:49,230
Intense power

6952
01:06:48,990 --> 01:06:50,210
Proper power combo

6953
01:06:51,230 --> 01:06:54,510
Straight home-run

6954
01:06:51,230 --> 01:06:54,510
Super power

6955
01:06:54,510 --> 01:06:56,520
Proper home-run

6956
01:06:56,520 --> 01:06:58,330
Well, these are Matsumoto's...

6957
01:06:58,330 --> 01:06:59,590
Why doesn't someone else give it a shot?

6958
01:06:59,590 --> 01:07:01,140
Since there's only so many items

6959
01:07:01,500 --> 01:07:01,520
Tanaka, try it!!

6960
01:07:01,520 --> 01:07:01,540
Tanaka, try it!!

6961
01:07:01,540 --> 01:07:01,550
Tanaka, try it!!

6962
01:07:01,550 --> 01:07:01,570
Tanaka, try it!!

6963
01:07:01,570 --> 01:07:01,590
Tanaka, try it!!

6964
01:07:01,590 --> 01:07:01,600
Tanaka, try it!!

6965
01:07:01,600 --> 01:07:01,620
Tanaka, try it!!

6966
01:07:01,620 --> 01:07:01,640
Tanaka, try it!!

6967
01:07:01,640 --> 01:07:03,910
Tanaka, try it!!

6968
01:07:04,170 --> 01:07:05,780
I was just about to

6969
01:07:11,610 --> 01:07:13,850
I wonder what it will be this time?

6970
01:07:12,470 --> 01:07:13,070
That's right

6971
01:07:15,020 --> 01:07:16,220
It's obviously for the lockers

6972
01:07:16,220 --> 01:07:18,620
It's certainly a key I think

6973
01:07:18,000 --> 01:07:18,620
Yup

6974
01:07:20,540 --> 01:07:21,120
It's number two

6975
01:07:21,120 --> 01:07:21,990
Number two?

6976
01:07:21,120 --> 01:07:25,860
Key number 2

6977
01:07:21,990 --> 01:07:22,560
Yes

6978
01:07:23,240 --> 01:07:28,010
Hmm.. The lockers are all the same size so...

6979
01:07:28,010 --> 01:07:28,820
They are

6980
01:07:28,820 --> 01:07:30,730
Five then two

6981
01:07:32,000 --> 01:07:32,550
There it is

6982
01:07:32,000 --> 01:07:34,150
Huge!!

6983
01:07:32,550 --> 01:07:34,150
It looks pretty big

6984
01:07:34,150 --> 01:07:36,070
Looks big? It IS big

6985
01:07:38,270 --> 01:07:41,230
Real-mask set

6986
01:07:42,410 --> 01:07:44,360
Eh? He gets this again?

6987
01:07:45,550 --> 01:07:47,480
Looks like a changing room over there

6988
01:07:46,680 --> 01:07:47,480
Yes yes yes

6989
01:07:47,680 --> 01:07:52,560
"Wear this and even you can become the celebrity of your dreams"

6990
01:07:50,550 --> 01:07:52,410
"The celebrity of your dreams"?

6991
01:07:52,560 --> 01:07:53,770
Excuse me for a minute

6992
01:07:54,670 --> 01:07:57,530
That guy always gets the masks

6993
01:07:56,590 --> 01:08:00,610
He's gotten masks before, right

6994
01:08:01,700 --> 01:08:03,730
I'm ready!!

6995
01:08:02,500 --> 01:08:03,500
Okay!

6996
01:08:04,130 --> 01:08:05,180
We're ready!

6997
01:08:14,380 --> 01:08:18,980
Funny mask

6998
01:08:14,380 --> 01:08:18,980
Hiroshi Fujioka, realistic version

6999
01:08:14,380 --> 01:08:18,980
T/N: Hiroshi Fujioka is an actor who is famous for his roles in Kamen Rider, Japanese historical dramas, and other dramas.

7000
01:08:17,850 --> 01:08:20,080
That's terrifying!!

7001
01:08:20,080 --> 01:08:23,250
The head's too big, but it looks just like Fujioka!

7002
01:08:22,200 --> 01:08:24,100
That's amazing!

7003
01:08:23,950 --> 01:08:25,050
Amazing!

7004
01:08:25,050 --> 01:08:26,490
Amazing!

7005
01:08:25,050 --> 01:08:26,490
Amazing!

7006
01:08:29,090 --> 01:08:30,090
That's amazing. It's really Fujioka!

7007
01:08:30,090 --> 01:08:34,410
That's amazing. It's really Fujioka!

7008
01:08:31,690 --> 01:08:33,780
He often has that exact expression too

7009
01:08:32,850 --> 01:08:34,110
Morning!

7010
01:08:34,760 --> 01:08:35,400
Mornin'

7011
01:08:36,430 --> 01:08:38,370
The mouth moves too?

7012
01:08:37,280 --> 01:08:38,370
Ah, the mouth moves

7013
01:08:38,370 --> 01:08:39,140
Yup

7014
01:08:39,140 --> 01:08:41,140
This is unbelievable...

7015
01:08:41,500 --> 01:08:44,010
Sing the theme song to Kamen Rider

7016
01:08:44,370 --> 01:08:52,580
Here they come, Shocker. The army of hell

7017
01:08:46,240 --> 01:08:52,580
Here they come, Shocker. The army of hell

7018
01:08:48,290 --> 01:08:52,580
Here they come, Shocker. The army of hell

7019
01:08:54,980 --> 01:08:56,990
The mouth moves funny

7020
01:08:59,110 --> 01:09:00,760
That's amazing!

7021
01:09:06,710 --> 01:09:07,960
There are no seams

7022
01:09:06,980 --> 01:09:08,760
Good stuff!

7023
01:09:08,760 --> 01:09:12,170
Why do you always get masks, Tanaka

7024
01:09:11,230 --> 01:09:12,490
Rather than a seam...

7025
01:09:12,720 --> 01:09:14,300
Ah, I see. It goes all the way down

7026
01:09:14,300 --> 01:09:16,810
It's just like Fujioka is really here

7027
01:09:16,810 --> 01:09:17,570
Uncanny!

7028
01:09:16,810 --> 01:09:18,570
You're right! It is kinda uncanny

7029
01:09:20,040 --> 01:09:22,380
Do the transformation

7030
01:09:21,130 --> 01:09:21,740
Transformation

7031
01:09:23,260 --> 01:09:27,880
Transform!!

7032
01:09:24,460 --> 01:09:27,880
Transform!!

7033
01:09:31,750 --> 01:09:34,970
You're so annoying!

7034
01:09:34,970 --> 01:09:37,590
It's really a great rendition of Fujioka

7035
01:09:42,370 --> 01:09:45,720
Quality work right there

7036
01:09:43,370 --> 01:09:45,520
Quality work indeed

7037
01:09:45,720 --> 01:09:47,840
Are you going next, Endo?

7038
01:09:46,570 --> 01:09:48,870
Let's give it a try

7039
01:09:47,950 --> 01:09:49,910
Hosei or me is fine too

7040
01:09:49,420 --> 01:09:50,020
I'll change

7041
01:09:50,020 --> 01:09:50,770
Okay!

7042
01:09:51,320 --> 01:09:52,140
Here I go

7043
01:09:53,580 --> 01:09:55,090
Must be a hassle to get out of...

7044
01:09:55,090 --> 01:09:56,810
Probably from the back

7045
01:09:56,980 --> 01:09:58,710
You too might have to go in there

7046
01:09:58,710 --> 01:09:59,680
Ah, yeah

7047
01:09:59,680 --> 01:10:01,080
Or maybe you can do it on the spot

7048
01:10:05,890 --> 01:10:09,030
The money system is really thoroughly made

7049
01:10:09,030 --> 01:10:10,040
It's black

7050
01:10:14,010 --> 01:10:15,700
Number 16

7051
01:10:14,010 --> 01:10:15,700
Number 16

7052
01:10:15,700 --> 01:10:19,400
Key number 16

7053
01:10:18,270 --> 01:10:19,400
No way

7054
01:10:19,400 --> 01:10:21,100
I see

7055
01:10:23,010 --> 01:10:24,970
This is really well done

7056
01:10:24,970 --> 01:10:27,460
There's so much skin on his neck

7057
01:10:26,530 --> 01:10:27,460
Yeah

7058
01:10:28,490 --> 01:10:29,810
Oh? The thing I've got

7059
01:10:29,810 --> 01:10:31,450
Doesn't seem to be a mask or anything

7060
01:10:31,450 --> 01:10:32,430
It's written here

7061
01:10:32,430 --> 01:10:34,430
Funny ball

7062
01:10:34,780 --> 01:10:38,670
"Throw it against the wall to relieve your stress?"

7063
01:10:36,850 --> 01:10:38,670
Relieve...

7064
01:10:37,750 --> 01:10:38,670
What's that?

7065
01:10:38,850 --> 01:10:41,360
Funny ball?

7066
01:10:42,010 --> 01:10:43,590
Looks like a normal ball to me

7067
01:10:43,940 --> 01:10:45,060
What's that?

7068
01:10:53,290 --> 01:10:53,300
It's me again!?

7069
01:10:53,300 --> 01:10:53,320
It's me again!?

7070
01:10:53,320 --> 01:10:53,340
It's me again!?

7071
01:10:53,340 --> 01:10:53,350
It's me again!?

7072
01:10:53,350 --> 01:10:53,370
It's me again!?

7073
01:10:53,370 --> 01:10:53,390
It's me again!?

7074
01:10:53,390 --> 01:10:53,400
It's me again!?

7075
01:10:53,400 --> 01:10:53,420
It's me again!?

7076
01:10:53,420 --> 01:10:53,440
It's me again!?

7077
01:10:53,440 --> 01:10:53,450
It's me again!?

7078
01:10:53,450 --> 01:10:53,470
It's me again!?

7079
01:10:53,470 --> 01:10:53,490
It's me again!?

7080
01:10:53,490 --> 01:10:53,500
It's me again!?

7081
01:10:53,500 --> 01:10:53,520
It's me again!?

7082
01:10:53,520 --> 01:10:53,540
It's me again!?

7083
01:10:53,540 --> 01:10:53,550
It's me again!?

7084
01:10:53,550 --> 01:10:53,570
It's me again!?

7085
01:10:53,570 --> 01:10:53,590
It's me again!?

7086
01:10:53,590 --> 01:10:53,600
It's me again!?

7087
01:10:53,600 --> 01:10:53,620
It's me again!?

7088
01:10:53,620 --> 01:10:53,640
It's me again!?

7089
01:10:53,640 --> 01:10:53,690
It's me again!?

7090
01:10:53,690 --> 01:10:53,720
It's me again!?

7091
01:10:53,720 --> 01:10:56,260
It's me again!?

7092
01:10:57,970 --> 01:11:00,540
Don't hold it like that!

7093
01:11:02,250 --> 01:11:03,780
That's so unfair!

7094
01:11:03,780 --> 01:11:07,650
So handsome

7095
01:11:05,800 --> 01:11:07,650
You're right

7096
01:11:06,450 --> 01:11:07,650
He is

7097
01:11:12,470 --> 01:11:13,710
It says...

7098
01:11:12,470 --> 01:11:15,470
What the hell is that? Stress relief?

7099
01:11:14,210 --> 01:11:15,560
It says "throw it on the wall"

7100
01:11:15,560 --> 01:11:17,230
To relieve your stress?

7101
01:11:15,560 --> 01:11:20,360
Funny Ball:

7102
01:11:15,560 --> 01:11:20,360
Throw it against the wall to relieve your stress

7103
01:11:18,730 --> 01:11:20,360
The hell is that?

7104
01:11:21,350 --> 01:11:22,570
That's impressive

7105
01:11:22,570 --> 01:11:24,280
It's really squishy

7106
01:11:24,280 --> 01:11:25,720
Look how squishy it is

7107
01:11:26,270 --> 01:11:27,850
What happens if I throw it?

7108
01:11:27,850 --> 01:11:29,170
You'll relieve your stress

7109
01:11:29,170 --> 01:11:31,310
Where should I throw it?

7110
01:11:31,310 --> 01:11:32,680
How about the floor instead?

7111
01:11:32,680 --> 01:11:35,010
To be honest, I don't really feel like doing it

7112
01:11:35,010 --> 01:11:36,980
It's fine

7113
01:11:36,000 --> 01:11:38,360
Alright, I'm sorry then, it's to relieve some stress

7114
01:11:46,410 --> 01:11:49,080
You can't throw it like that, geez

7115
01:11:49,630 --> 01:11:52,030
That was so strong

7116
01:11:50,680 --> 01:11:52,030
But it's for my stress...

7117
01:11:55,500 --> 01:11:59,070
The top of his head hit the floor first

7118
01:11:59,070 --> 01:11:59,870
It didn't bounce

7119
01:11:59,870 --> 01:12:01,420
Not at all

7120
01:12:00,650 --> 01:12:01,420
You're right

7121
01:12:01,420 --> 01:12:02,940
It doesn't bounce

7122
01:12:01,420 --> 01:12:04,140
Oh, is that so?

7123
01:12:02,940 --> 01:12:05,140
It just smashed on the ground

7124
01:12:05,960 --> 01:12:07,440
Don't press it like that

7125
01:12:07,440 --> 01:12:10,150
Don't press my forehead that much

7126
01:12:10,730 --> 01:12:12,720
Quit it

7127
01:12:11,110 --> 01:12:12,720
Don't do that

7128
01:12:16,220 --> 01:12:17,520
What are you doing?

7129
01:12:23,560 --> 01:12:26,200
It's an anti-slip device, like that

7130
01:12:25,040 --> 01:12:26,200
Exactly

7131
01:12:26,500 --> 01:12:28,600
That won't help you relieve your stress

7132
01:12:28,600 --> 01:12:30,470
You have to throw it

7133
01:12:30,470 --> 01:12:31,570
It'll damage the furniture

7134
01:12:31,570 --> 01:12:34,900
No no, I think this is taking it too far

7135
01:12:35,140 --> 01:12:38,010
Oh, because it'll hurt Hamada

7136
01:12:39,830 --> 01:12:41,380
You just laughed

7137
01:12:40,390 --> 01:12:41,380
Who?

7138
01:12:42,580 --> 01:12:45,850
The furniture will be fine, but Hamada is gonna get hurt

7139
01:12:45,850 --> 01:12:47,370
Don't squish its chin

7140
01:12:47,700 --> 01:12:49,170
Don't say it like that

7141
01:12:48,280 --> 01:12:48,980
That's incredible

7142
01:12:48,720 --> 01:12:50,190
It's really well made

7143
01:12:49,540 --> 01:12:51,200
Whoa, check that out

7144
01:12:55,730 --> 01:12:55,810
Whoa, wait a second,

7145
01:12:55,810 --> 01:12:55,880
Whoa, wait a second,

7146
01:12:55,880 --> 01:12:55,940
Whoa, wait a second,

7147
01:12:55,940 --> 01:12:59,430
Whoa, wait a second,

7148
01:12:57,240 --> 01:12:59,430
what are you doing?!

7149
01:12:58,140 --> 01:12:59,430
It came off

7150
01:12:58,140 --> 01:12:59,430
It came off

7151
01:12:59,430 --> 01:13:03,000
Its chin came off

7152
01:13:00,930 --> 01:13:01,950
Hamada-san?

7153
01:13:02,350 --> 01:13:04,020
Whoa, check this out

7154
01:13:04,300 --> 01:13:07,300
It looks like Attack on Titan

7155
01:13:06,520 --> 01:13:07,300
It broke

7156
01:13:09,210 --> 01:13:13,410
Don't you feel bad for Hamada?

7157
01:13:13,410 --> 01:13:14,130
Look at this

7158
01:13:14,130 --> 01:13:16,080
But you almost fixed it

7159
01:13:16,080 --> 01:13:17,550
He's got a protruding chin now

7160
01:13:16,080 --> 01:13:17,550
It's a protruding chin

7161
01:13:18,410 --> 01:13:19,170
You're right

7162
01:13:19,170 --> 01:13:22,170
It's a new chin for him

7163
01:13:22,790 --> 01:13:23,620
Oh, but...

7164
01:13:23,620 --> 01:13:26,590
We can restore it, look

7165
01:13:28,660 --> 01:13:28,710
It's not restored at all!!

7166
01:13:28,710 --> 01:13:28,720
It's not restored at all!!

7167
01:13:28,720 --> 01:13:28,770
It's not restored at all!!

7168
01:13:28,770 --> 01:13:30,930
It's not restored at all!!

7169
01:13:43,090 --> 01:13:44,370
Come on...

7170
01:13:45,740 --> 01:13:46,910
This is impressive

7171
01:13:46,910 --> 01:13:48,430
We should stop playing with it

7172
01:13:48,430 --> 01:13:49,310
Yeah, I mean

7173
01:13:49,310 --> 01:13:52,010
Now that you tore it apart we can't use it!

7174
01:13:51,360 --> 01:13:52,010
Right

7175
01:13:52,010 --> 01:13:53,870
Let's just place it over there

7176
01:13:54,150 --> 01:13:55,330
You should feel sorry

7177
01:13:56,740 --> 01:13:58,050
Here we are

7178
01:13:58,950 --> 01:14:01,220
Hamada-san, do you want to go next?

7179
01:13:59,960 --> 01:14:01,220
I completely forgot about it!

7180
01:14:01,560 --> 01:14:02,490
That's right!

7181
01:14:02,490 --> 01:14:02,930
Right?

7182
01:14:02,930 --> 01:14:03,710
Me too

7183
01:14:04,230 --> 01:14:05,960
It could be empty, who knows

7184
01:14:04,840 --> 01:14:06,630
I completely forgot too

7185
01:14:05,850 --> 01:14:06,630
It's full of stuff

7186
01:14:06,630 --> 01:14:08,130
No way

7187
01:14:08,130 --> 01:14:10,030
It's suddenly full of stuff

7188
01:14:09,250 --> 01:14:10,500
Check the other ones

7189
01:14:10,500 --> 01:14:12,130
This one was kinda opened

7190
01:14:12,940 --> 01:14:14,220
But they're empty

7191
01:14:14,220 --> 01:14:16,920
I got some DVDs on my drawer

7192
01:14:14,550 --> 01:14:15,470
Two of them

7193
01:14:16,990 --> 01:14:17,970
Could it be...?

7194
01:14:17,970 --> 01:14:24,280
Mysterious DVD & envelope

7195
01:14:18,220 --> 01:14:20,110
It could be a new pattern

7196
01:14:18,920 --> 01:14:20,930
No way, man

7197
01:14:20,110 --> 01:14:23,950
We can't possibly know what's on it

7198
01:14:20,930 --> 01:14:22,450
It could be

7199
01:14:24,280 --> 01:14:26,350
What's this?

7200
01:14:25,380 --> 01:14:27,100
What's that? Rock-paper-scissor?

7201
01:14:26,300 --> 01:14:27,480
Is that it?

7202
01:14:27,100 --> 01:14:27,700
Ah!

7203
01:14:28,080 --> 01:14:31,140
Isn't that the game from Kaiji?

7204
01:14:28,080 --> 01:14:33,240
T/N: This is a reference from the anime, Kaiji: Ultimate Survivor.

7205
01:14:28,080 --> 01:14:35,760
Mysterious rock-paper-scissors cards

7206
01:14:31,140 --> 01:14:31,940
Is it?

7207
01:14:32,400 --> 01:14:33,240
Kaiji?

7208
01:14:33,240 --> 01:14:33,970
Right?

7209
01:14:34,590 --> 01:14:35,760
I remember it

7210
01:14:39,660 --> 01:14:42,200
It's that psychological game

7211
01:14:42,200 --> 01:14:43,520
It's Tanaka who gets DVDs, usually

7212
01:14:43,520 --> 01:14:45,070
That's right

7213
01:14:44,470 --> 01:14:46,150
Yeah, but it's not a set rule

7214
01:14:46,150 --> 01:14:47,650
Well, true

7215
01:14:46,470 --> 01:14:47,650
Of course it's not

7216
01:14:52,310 --> 01:14:52,980
Yukio Tonegawa

7217
01:14:52,310 --> 01:14:56,500
T/N: Yukio Tonegawa is a character from Kaiji who is in charge of many of the gambling events throughout the anime.

7218
01:14:52,310 --> 01:14:56,500
Yukio Tonegawa

7219
01:14:52,910 --> 01:14:53,710
See?

7220
01:14:54,780 --> 01:14:56,180
It's Kaiji

7221
01:14:55,310 --> 01:14:56,180
It is

7222
01:14:57,250 --> 01:14:59,720
You're the worst scum in showbiz

7223
01:14:59,720 --> 01:15:01,880
The lowest in Setagaya! Masatoshi Hamada

7224
01:14:59,720 --> 01:15:07,720
T/N: Setagaya is a very posh neighborhood in Tokyo where Hamada presumably lives.

7225
01:15:01,880 --> 01:15:03,650
The lowest in Setagaya! Masatoshi Hamada

7226
01:15:04,550 --> 01:15:07,720
You got older and lost your hopes and dreams

7227
01:15:07,720 --> 01:15:10,560
For you, who is living as if you're already dead,

7228
01:15:10,560 --> 01:15:13,360
I'll grant you a once in a lifetime chance!

7229
01:15:13,360 --> 01:15:16,200
What now!?

7230
01:15:16,230 --> 01:15:18,070
From now on,

7231
01:15:18,070 --> 01:15:22,440
You'll take part in a game our Teiai Group came up with

7232
01:15:18,070 --> 01:15:24,140
T/N: Teiai Group is a fictional company from Kaiji that pretends to be a consulting firm while forcing people into debt and putting them in gambling events or labor camps.

7233
01:15:23,140 --> 01:15:24,140
And that will be...

7234
01:15:24,670 --> 01:15:26,010
Restricted Rock, Paper, Scissors

7235
01:15:26,010 --> 01:15:27,380
Restricted Rock, Paper, Scissors

7236
01:15:27,380 --> 01:15:28,960
What does it mean?

7237
01:15:29,660 --> 01:15:29,750
Restricted Rock, Paper, Scissors

7238
01:15:29,750 --> 01:15:29,760
Restricted Rock, Paper, Scissors

7239
01:15:29,760 --> 01:15:29,780
Restricted Rock, Paper, Scissors

7240
01:15:29,780 --> 01:15:29,800
Restricted Rock, Paper, Scissors

7241
01:15:29,800 --> 01:15:29,810
Restricted Rock, Paper, Scissors

7242
01:15:29,810 --> 01:15:29,830
Restricted Rock, Paper, Scissors

7243
01:15:29,830 --> 01:15:29,850
Restricted Rock, Paper, Scissors

7244
01:15:29,850 --> 01:15:29,860
Restricted Rock, Paper, Scissors

7245
01:15:29,860 --> 01:15:29,880
Restricted Rock, Paper, Scissors

7246
01:15:29,880 --> 01:15:29,900
Restricted Rock, Paper, Scissors

7247
01:15:29,900 --> 01:15:29,910
Restricted Rock, Paper, Scissors

Restricted Rock, Paper, Scissors

7250
01:15:29,950 --> 01:15:32,180
Restricted Rock, Paper, Scissors

7251
01:15:35,280 --> 01:15:37,650
Even an idiot like you can understand its rules

7252
01:15:37,500 --> 01:15:39,050
He's badmouthing
me so much!

7253
01:15:37,650 --> 01:15:39,590
Because they're very simple!

7254
01:15:39,050 --> 01:15:40,870
Yeah, he's foul

7255
01:15:39,770 --> 01:15:58,770
Rules

7256
01:15:39,790 --> 01:15:49,400
Play rock-paper-scissors in a single duel with your opponent

7257
01:15:39,790 --> 01:15:58,770
m 112.5 855 l 1810.5 855 1810.5 1020 112.5 1020

7258
01:15:40,110 --> 01:15:43,380
You have some rock-paper-scissors card with you

7259
01:15:44,260 --> 01:15:48,350
You just challenge your opponent with those in a single duel

7260
01:15:48,350 --> 01:15:49,670
I see

7261
01:15:49,400 --> 01:15:58,770
"Win" or "Tie" will grant you a deluxe item!

7262
01:15:49,880 --> 01:15:51,300
If you win

7263
01:15:51,300 --> 01:15:53,770
Or even if it's tie, you'll win

7264
01:15:53,770 --> 01:15:54,600
That's nice!

7265
01:15:54,600 --> 01:15:55,620
Right

7266
01:15:54,900 --> 01:15:58,020
You'll even get a deluxe prize! You have the best odds

7267
01:15:59,380 --> 01:16:00,780
However!

7268
01:16:01,410 --> 01:16:03,810
If you happen to lose...

7269
01:16:03,750 --> 01:16:06,250
T/N: All the "zawa" sounds in the background is a famous characteristic of Kaiji. It's a mimetic word for "sending chills down your spine".

7270
01:16:07,150 --> 01:16:09,050
You'll get a Thai kick!!

7271
01:16:09,220 --> 01:16:11,050
Is that what it's all about!?

7272
01:16:12,250 --> 01:16:13,360
It's Hamada's turn now?

7273
01:16:13,160 --> 01:16:16,260
And your opponent for this game is going to be...

7274
01:16:16,260 --> 01:16:19,700
Another person who's full of debt towards our society

7275
01:16:20,560 --> 01:16:23,430
Another scum among the scums!

7276
01:16:23,430 --> 01:16:26,570
Make sure to entertain us

7277
01:16:29,440 --> 01:16:30,570
Alright, enter the room, Hamada's opponent!

7278
01:16:30,570 --> 01:16:32,170
Alright, enter the room, Hamada's opponent!

7279
01:16:32,170 --> 01:16:36,310
Alright, enter the room, Hamada's opponent!

7280
01:16:37,750 --> 01:16:38,710
It's Mr. Thai Kick

7281
01:16:38,710 --> 01:16:40,020
Mr. Thai Kick...

7282
01:16:40,020 --> 01:16:42,350
Yes, this man too

7283
01:16:42,350 --> 01:16:46,160
Has a huge debt piled up for the Teian Group

7284
01:16:46,160 --> 01:16:47,320
Pachinko! Horse racing! Boat races! And even underground casinos!

7285
01:16:47,320 --> 01:16:48,320
Pachinko! Horse racing! Boat races! And even underground casinos!

7286
01:16:48,320 --> 01:16:49,590
Pachinko! Horse racing! Boat races! And even underground casinos!

7287
01:16:49,590 --> 01:16:51,360
Pachinko! Horse racing! Boat races! And even underground casinos!

7288
01:16:51,090 --> 01:16:53,250
He's wearing Kaiji's clothes

7289
01:16:51,930 --> 01:16:54,700
He tried every possible form of gambling!

7290
01:16:54,700 --> 01:16:56,430
Without even looking for a job

7291
01:16:56,430 --> 01:16:59,340
He spent everyday drinking Thai beer alone!

7292
01:16:59,870 --> 01:17:03,610
A man ready to eat his Tom Yum Kung without paying for it...

7293
01:16:59,870 --> 01:17:03,610
T/N: Tom Yum Kung is a popular Thai soup.

7294
01:17:03,840 --> 01:17:06,110
The worst kind of scum, from Thailand's slums...

7295
01:17:06,110 --> 01:17:08,210
The worst kind of scum, from Thailand's slums...

7296
01:17:08,210 --> 01:17:10,780
Thaiji!

7297
01:17:14,500 --> 01:17:15,530
Of course

7298
01:17:15,780 --> 01:17:17,490
There's no need to say all of that!

7299
01:17:19,660 --> 01:17:23,490
T/N: In the Treasure Hunter Batsu, Tanaka battled Thai Kick in a card game.

7300
01:17:19,660 --> 01:17:23,660
I saw a scene like this with you, before

7301
01:17:22,120 --> 01:17:23,660
That's right

7302
01:17:24,190 --> 01:17:26,200
That time he got me, but you have to win!

7303
01:17:26,200 --> 01:17:28,230
That time he got me, but you have to win!

7304
01:17:26,850 --> 01:17:28,230
See? There's that guy again

7305
01:17:28,230 --> 01:17:29,800
That's right

7306
01:17:29,800 --> 01:17:33,870
Game Master

7307
01:17:29,800 --> 01:17:33,870
Ralph Suzuki

7308
01:17:30,070 --> 01:17:31,000
But you can win

7309
01:17:31,000 --> 01:17:32,940
Right, you're most likely to win here

7310
01:17:32,940 --> 01:17:33,870
Even a tie will do it

7311
01:17:33,870 --> 01:17:34,840
Alright,

7312
01:17:34,840 --> 01:17:36,710
Hamada-sama, pick a card and place it here

7313
01:17:36,710 --> 01:17:38,270
Hamada-sama, pick a card and place it here

7314
01:17:38,270 --> 01:17:41,110
You can do it!!

7315
01:17:39,020 --> 01:17:41,110
Do your best

7316
01:17:41,110 --> 01:17:43,410
You can do this!

7317
01:17:43,410 --> 01:17:47,150
Tanaka doesn't want to see a friend getting Thai kicked

7318
01:17:45,680 --> 01:17:47,150
Of course not

7319
01:17:48,050 --> 01:17:49,590
Last time I lost

7320
01:17:49,790 --> 01:17:51,820
Please, avenge me!

7321
01:17:51,240 --> 01:17:53,320
I don't want to do this...

7322
01:17:53,870 --> 01:17:58,430
Alright, gentlemen, let's get this match started

7323
01:17:54,190 --> 01:17:59,030
Restricted Rock-Paper-Scissors Battle

7324
01:17:54,190 --> 01:17:59,030
Thaiji vs Hamada

7325
01:17:58,430 --> 01:17:59,030
Sure

7326
01:18:03,500 --> 01:18:06,300
But in that very moment, Tonegawa, the game organizer,

7327
01:18:06,900 --> 01:18:11,540
Had some conflicts inside his mind

7328
01:18:12,140 --> 01:18:13,310
Hm? Wait...

7329
01:18:13,310 --> 01:18:14,710
Hm? Wait...

7330
01:18:14,710 --> 01:18:17,680
If Thaiji is going to win...

7331
01:18:17,910 --> 01:18:21,650
Then we'll have to Thai kick this guy's butt...

7332
01:18:22,620 --> 01:18:24,390
But I'm sure...

7333
01:18:24,390 --> 01:18:26,560
This guy knows a bunch of criminals, he's the "Criminal Comedian"

7334
01:18:26,560 --> 01:18:28,660
This guy knows a bunch of criminals, he's the "Criminal Comedian"

7335
01:18:29,020 --> 01:18:31,890
If we'd Thai kick this guy's butt...

7336
01:18:31,890 --> 01:18:36,400
It could lead to an all-out war betwen our group and his gang

7337
01:18:36,700 --> 01:18:40,270
It's clear it's going to bring us lots of trouble! We can't have that

7338
01:18:40,270 --> 01:18:43,770
It's clear it's going to bring us lots of trouble! We can't have that

7339
01:18:46,840 --> 01:18:49,510
To Thai kick Hamada, the Criminal Comedian's butt...

7340
01:18:49,510 --> 01:18:52,720
Is way too risky for us...

7341
01:18:52,720 --> 01:18:56,220
I know! Maybe we should do as usual...

7342
01:18:58,090 --> 01:18:59,920
And choose Tanaka instead!

7343
01:18:59,920 --> 01:19:01,920
Why the hell!?

7344
01:19:04,230 --> 01:19:05,830
No

7345
01:19:05,830 --> 01:19:09,830
That guy's reactions are so scripted, he's such a big liar

7346
01:19:10,700 --> 01:19:15,140
He's only doing this good guy charade, but he's such a douche

7347
01:19:15,140 --> 01:19:16,510
Let's not do that

7348
01:19:16,910 --> 01:19:17,140
Right

7349
01:19:17,140 --> 01:19:17,370
Right

7350
01:19:17,370 --> 01:19:17,610
Right

7351
01:19:17,610 --> 01:19:17,840
Right

7352
01:19:17,840 --> 01:19:18,040
Right

7353
01:19:18,040 --> 01:19:18,210
Right

7354
01:19:18,210 --> 01:19:18,410
Right

7355
01:19:18,410 --> 01:19:18,840
Nice!!

7356
01:19:18,840 --> 01:19:19,610
It's not you?

7357
01:19:19,610 --> 01:19:20,240
How about his partner, Endo?

7358
01:19:19,610 --> 01:19:21,330
Nice nice!

7359
01:19:20,240 --> 01:19:22,440
How about his partner, Endo?

7360
01:19:21,580 --> 01:19:22,440
Endo-san!

7361
01:19:21,580 --> 01:19:23,150
No way, why me!?

7362
01:19:24,850 --> 01:19:26,450
No way, no way! Endo is too weak

7363
01:19:26,450 --> 01:19:28,520
No way, no way! Endo is too weak

7364
01:19:28,520 --> 01:19:31,490
His impact on TV is nonexistent!

7365
01:19:32,250 --> 01:19:35,720
I never even see any news about him anywhere

7366
01:19:35,720 --> 01:19:41,060
Stereotyped! No charm! Zero TV impact!

7367
01:19:41,060 --> 01:19:46,500
Tonegawa realized how terribly useless Cocorico is

7368
01:19:46,500 --> 01:19:49,640
And even Thaiji could smell from Cocorico

7369
01:19:49,660 --> 01:19:55,940
The same stench of uselessness that he himself has

7370
01:19:53,290 --> 01:19:55,940
That's rude, Thaiji

7371
01:19:59,970 --> 01:20:02,220
He said too much...

7372
01:20:02,450 --> 01:20:03,050
What's gonna happen!?

7373
01:20:03,050 --> 01:20:05,890
What's gonna happen!?

7374
01:20:03,350 --> 01:20:04,640
I have no clue

7375
01:20:04,640 --> 01:20:05,890
We didn't even laugh

7376
01:20:07,220 --> 01:20:09,060
It's not something to laugh about

7377
01:20:09,060 --> 01:20:11,890
No way we're gonna laugh at that, of course

7378
01:20:10,910 --> 01:20:11,890
Really?

7379
01:20:11,890 --> 01:20:13,330
Then what...?

7380
01:20:13,330 --> 01:20:14,560
So?

7381
01:20:15,230 --> 01:20:18,100
I guess we'll have to do Hosei, then...

7382
01:20:21,140 --> 01:20:23,240
No, wait

7383
01:20:23,570 --> 01:20:27,210
This guy acts like a cultured man ever since becoming a Rakugo-ka

7384
01:20:27,210 --> 01:20:30,610
I've heard it's such a hassle to deal with him

7385
01:20:31,910 --> 01:20:37,020
Any entertainers who start acting cultured are just troublesome

7386
01:20:37,020 --> 01:20:41,620
A loathed man who is avoided by the young ones in the dressing room!!

7387
01:20:41,620 --> 01:20:43,430
Wish he'd hurry making up his mind

7388
01:20:42,460 --> 01:20:43,760
In that case, the remaining one is?

7389
01:20:43,760 --> 01:20:46,260
In that case, the remaining one is?

7390
01:20:49,130 --> 01:20:51,630
The remaining one is Matsumoto...

7391
01:20:50,630 --> 01:20:51,630
Here we go

7392
01:20:54,300 --> 01:20:56,310
Indeed if I choose Matsumoto to do this

7393
01:20:56,310 --> 01:21:00,110
The audiences will have higher expectations than those 4 small fry

7394
01:21:01,480 --> 01:21:03,910
But the problem is...

7395
01:21:05,880 --> 01:21:10,550
The show producer may get yelled at...

7396
01:21:10,550 --> 01:21:13,690
Whatever, this is for the sake of viewer rating

7397
01:21:10,990 --> 01:21:12,840
As if I'll yell at the guy!

7398
01:21:12,840 --> 01:21:14,110
No way I'll yell at him!

7399
01:21:13,690 --> 01:21:16,730
We'll have the producer get down on his knees and apologize for the greater good

7400
01:21:13,690 --> 01:21:16,730
m 357 943.5 l 1564.5 943.5 l 1564.5 1080 l 357 1080

7401
01:21:16,730 --> 01:21:21,100
Yeah! And this is part of his job anyway

7402
01:21:17,030 --> 01:21:17,810
Oh no

7403
01:21:20,150 --> 01:21:21,100
That makes sense

7404
01:21:21,100 --> 01:21:23,600
No wait!

7405
01:21:23,600 --> 01:21:28,240
If the producer leaks to magazines about having to apologize on his knees

7406
01:21:23,600 --> 01:21:28,240
m 259.5 943.5 l 1656 943.5 l 1656 1080 l 259.5 1080

7407
01:21:28,240 --> 01:21:30,740
That would be the end of this show...

7408
01:21:31,340 --> 01:21:33,440
That'd be bad!

7409
01:21:33,780 --> 01:21:36,040
Eh!?

7410
01:21:35,990 --> 01:21:37,450
Is it coming back to me again?

7411
01:21:37,180 --> 01:21:38,810
Change the plan!

7412
01:21:38,650 --> 01:21:39,730
He decided!?

7413
01:21:38,810 --> 01:21:40,720
Yo Hamada! Switch with Tanaka!!

7414
01:21:39,800 --> 01:21:40,650
What?

7415
01:21:40,720 --> 01:21:41,980
Yo Hamada! Switch with Tanaka!!

7416
01:21:41,980 --> 01:21:42,430
Yaaaaay!!

7417
01:21:41,980 --> 01:21:42,430
Yaaaaay!!

7418
01:21:41,980 --> 01:21:42,430
Yaaaaay!!

7419
01:21:41,980 --> 01:21:42,430
Yaaaaay!!

7420
01:21:42,430 --> 01:21:44,850
Yaaaaay!!

7421
01:21:42,430 --> 01:21:44,850
Yaaaaay!!

7422
01:21:42,430 --> 01:21:44,850
Yaaaaay!!

7423
01:21:42,430 --> 01:21:44,850
Yaaaaay!!

7424
01:21:44,850 --> 01:21:46,890
Wait a minute

7425
01:21:46,890 --> 01:21:49,960
What is even happening!!

7426
01:21:49,320 --> 01:21:51,730
Scared me

7427
01:21:49,960 --> 01:21:51,230
No no no no no no

7428
01:21:51,360 --> 01:21:54,360
After all that circling around Hamada and then this

7429
01:21:54,360 --> 01:21:56,730
This should be Hamada in the end, it should!

7430
01:21:54,800 --> 01:21:58,230
He says switch

7431
01:21:56,160 --> 01:21:57,500
That was close

7432
01:21:57,050 --> 01:21:58,470
Just do it

7433
01:21:58,470 --> 01:22:02,740
This is a joke right!?

7434
01:22:00,090 --> 01:22:02,620
This is quite good, I have no regret getting my butt spanked

7435
01:22:07,010 --> 01:22:08,240
No, not happening!! This is not happening!!

7436
01:22:08,240 --> 01:22:10,980
No, not happening!! This is not happening!!

7437
01:22:09,130 --> 01:22:10,980
But this is all settled

7438
01:22:09,130 --> 01:22:10,980
You're too worried

7439
01:22:10,030 --> 01:22:11,350
Too late

7440
01:22:11,350 --> 01:22:13,150
This is already decided

7441
01:22:12,110 --> 01:22:13,150
Let's go, let's go

7442
01:22:13,150 --> 01:22:16,080
Mr. Tanaka please be seated here

7443
01:22:13,870 --> 01:22:14,200
Yes

7444
01:22:15,150 --> 01:22:16,300
Hurry hurry

7445
01:22:17,250 --> 01:22:19,350
You lost last time so just go

7446
01:22:18,720 --> 01:22:19,350
Uhmm ...

7447
01:22:19,400 --> 01:22:21,570
We will cheer you up big time

7448
01:22:20,820 --> 01:22:22,660
Please lend me strength, all your strength!!

7449
01:22:21,670 --> 01:22:22,660
Ok ok ok ok

7450
01:22:22,660 --> 01:22:25,330
Please lend me strength, all your strength!!

7451
01:22:23,330 --> 01:22:24,410
Yup

7452
01:22:23,610 --> 01:22:24,410
Of course

7453
01:22:25,330 --> 01:22:29,400
I don't want to always be the one to get Thai kicked every single year!!

7454
01:22:27,660 --> 01:22:29,400
Yeah yeah yeah

7455
01:22:28,500 --> 01:22:29,400
That's right

7456
01:22:29,400 --> 01:22:32,900
It's getting harder and harder for him to come up with reactions

7457
01:22:31,380 --> 01:22:32,520
That's right

7458
01:22:31,980 --> 01:22:34,470
I don't know if I should call it a reaction or what

7459
01:22:34,790 --> 01:22:40,680
Restricted Rock-Paper-Scissors Battle

7460
01:22:34,790 --> 01:22:40,680
Thaiji vs Tanaka

7461
01:22:35,550 --> 01:22:37,990
Now, to continue where we left off,

7462
01:22:37,990 --> 01:22:41,790
We will start the Restricted Rock-Paper-Scissors

7463
01:22:42,840 --> 01:22:44,350
Both players

7464
01:22:44,350 --> 01:22:48,480
Please decide which card you would like to use

7465
01:22:48,480 --> 01:22:49,580
This is it

7466
01:22:54,020 --> 01:22:55,660
First, Thaiji

7467
01:22:55,660 --> 01:22:57,490
First, Thaiji

7468
01:23:00,600 --> 01:23:03,430
He goes first

7469
01:23:04,870 --> 01:23:06,100
So he goes first

7470
01:23:06,100 --> 01:23:08,600
Next, Mr Tanaka

7471
01:23:12,760 --> 01:23:14,610
Are you okay with your decisions?

7472
01:23:16,190 --> 01:23:18,980
Okay, now

7473
01:23:18,980 --> 01:23:24,020
To prevent any cheating,

7474
01:23:20,650 --> 01:23:24,020
I will personally reveal the cards

7475
01:23:23,190 --> 01:23:24,020
I see

7476
01:23:24,620 --> 01:23:27,190
Now, let's begin

7477
01:23:29,010 --> 01:23:31,790
Card reveal

7478
01:23:31,790 --> 01:23:32,460
Card reveal

7479
01:23:32,860 --> 01:23:37,000
A sudden power outage

7480
01:23:35,430 --> 01:23:37,000
What happened?

7481
01:23:35,860 --> 01:23:37,000
Wait, what?

7482
01:23:37,000 --> 01:23:38,530
It's a power
outage

7483
01:23:37,030 --> 01:23:39,080
Power Outage

7484
01:23:37,770 --> 01:23:39,570
Oh my

7485
01:23:38,530 --> 01:23:39,570
It's a power
outage

7486
01:23:40,100 --> 01:23:44,640
Please

7487
01:23:42,170 --> 01:23:44,640
Wait a moment

7488
01:23:42,740 --> 01:23:42,840
Hey

7489
01:23:42,840 --> 01:23:42,970
Hey

7490
01:23:42,970 --> 01:23:43,110
Hey

7491
01:23:43,110 --> 01:23:45,910
Hey

7492
01:23:44,740 --> 01:23:45,910
This looks like happens a lot

7493
01:23:45,010 --> 01:23:46,430
Rustle

7494
01:23:45,110 --> 01:23:46,430
Rustle

7495
01:23:45,910 --> 01:23:46,710
This kind of timing,a power outage, for real?

7496
01:23:46,410 --> 01:23:47,830
Rustle

7497
01:23:46,510 --> 01:23:47,830
Rustle

7498
01:23:46,710 --> 01:23:48,310
This kind of timing, a power outage, for real?

7499
01:23:48,310 --> 01:23:51,210
Kinda long

7500
01:23:48,310 --> 01:23:51,210
This is

7501
01:23:49,460 --> 01:23:51,380
Quite long indeed

7502
01:23:49,510 --> 01:23:51,110
Bump

7503
01:23:51,110 --> 01:23:52,150
Rattle rattle

7504
01:23:51,210 --> 01:23:52,350
Amazing that it gets this dark

7505
01:23:52,150 --> 01:23:53,250
Rattle rattle

7506
01:23:52,350 --> 01:23:54,180
Amazing that it gets this dark

7507
01:23:54,180 --> 01:23:55,680
I can't see a thing

7508
01:23:54,520 --> 01:23:56,520
Can't see anything

7509
01:23:55,680 --> 01:23:56,490
Nothing can be seen

7510
01:23:55,680 --> 01:23:56,490
Really can't  see anything

7511
01:23:56,490 --> 01:23:57,550
Really can't see anything

7512
01:23:56,490 --> 01:23:58,250
Nothing can be seen

7513
01:23:57,550 --> 01:24:00,360
This is so long

7514
01:23:58,250 --> 01:24:00,360
Indeed long

7515
01:24:00,720 --> 01:24:04,160
Power restored

7516
01:24:02,570 --> 01:24:04,160
The power has been restored

7517
01:24:13,040 --> 01:24:14,820
This is crazy

7518
01:24:20,980 --> 01:24:22,780
Why'd you hide this

7519
01:24:22,840 --> 01:24:26,210
Apology, the power has been restored

7520
01:24:24,250 --> 01:24:26,210
Why'd you hide this

7521
01:24:26,350 --> 01:24:26,650
Wait

7522
01:24:26,650 --> 01:24:26,920
Wait

7523
01:24:26,920 --> 01:24:27,180
Wait, this

7524
01:24:27,180 --> 01:24:29,450
Wait, this

7525
01:24:29,500 --> 01:24:30,700
This is clearly...

7526
01:24:30,890 --> 01:24:33,090
But still, we don't know what happened

7527
01:24:33,090 --> 01:24:34,860
But still, we don't know what happened

7528
01:24:34,290 --> 01:24:34,860
Yup, we don't know

7529
01:24:36,730 --> 01:24:40,760
I will personally reveal the cards

7530
01:24:36,730 --> 01:24:40,760
To prevent any cheating,

7531
01:24:43,470 --> 01:24:46,380
Card Reveal

7532
01:24:46,380 --> 01:24:48,420
Card Reveal

7533
01:24:46,470 --> 01:24:54,680
Tanaka

7534
01:24:46,470 --> 01:24:54,680
Thaiji

7535
01:24:50,110 --> 01:24:52,670
You lost

7536
01:24:50,310 --> 01:24:51,190
Winner Thaiji!!

7537
01:24:50,310 --> 01:24:54,640
Winner Thaiji!!

7538
01:24:52,670 --> 01:24:54,860
Okay we all saw what happened here, right?

7539
01:24:54,890 --> 01:24:58,250
This is just too much

7540
01:24:54,910 --> 01:24:56,900
Why what happened?

7541
01:24:58,450 --> 01:25:01,980
I do not accept it

7542
01:24:58,860 --> 01:24:59,710
You lost it

7543
01:24:58,860 --> 01:25:01,980
But you lost

7544
01:24:59,610 --> 01:25:01,620
Not happening

7545
01:25:00,370 --> 01:25:01,980
Explain what you are trying to say

7546
01:25:01,980 --> 01:25:03,790
No no no, because you all saw it

7547
01:25:03,790 --> 01:25:05,750
The outage was suspicious

7548
01:25:07,260 --> 01:25:10,590
And after the outage, what on earth were those weird goggles

7549
01:25:09,360 --> 01:25:11,790
No idea

7550
01:25:10,560 --> 01:25:11,790
These?

7551
01:25:11,060 --> 01:25:11,790
These!

7552
01:25:11,940 --> 01:25:13,400
Look

7553
01:25:12,830 --> 01:25:13,400
Well, that...

7554
01:25:13,400 --> 01:25:15,330
He was wearing these

7555
01:25:15,330 --> 01:25:17,630
Thai Kick-san

7556
01:25:16,500 --> 01:25:18,480
It does looks like it...

7557
01:25:17,630 --> 01:25:19,400
Not even trying to hide his cheating

7558
01:25:19,400 --> 01:25:20,640
And that's why I lost

7559
01:25:20,640 --> 01:25:21,840
But I didn't hear any noise

7560
01:25:21,840 --> 01:25:23,470
I heard it!!

7561
01:25:24,140 --> 01:25:27,240
Rattle rattle rattle rattle rustle rustle rustle rustle

7562
01:25:27,240 --> 01:25:29,140
"What is going on?" I wondered

7563
01:25:29,140 --> 01:25:31,380
It lasts forever

7564
01:25:31,380 --> 01:25:32,980
At least try not to be so noisy

7565
01:25:32,980 --> 01:25:35,450
Rattle rattle rustle rustle rustle rustle

7566
01:25:34,450 --> 01:25:35,450
Just let it go

7567
01:25:35,450 --> 01:25:38,090
It's time for the Thai Kick

7568
01:25:37,040 --> 01:25:38,090
Nope

7569
01:25:38,250 --> 01:25:39,890
Come on, no "Nope"

7570
01:25:38,900 --> 01:25:41,140
Don't think you can talk this out

7571
01:25:39,890 --> 01:25:40,990
Nope, Not happening

7572
01:25:40,990 --> 01:25:42,020
Nope, Not happening

7573
01:25:42,020 --> 01:25:44,980
Stop being a baby, we can't watch this anymore

7574
01:25:46,160 --> 01:25:48,060
Alright! I got you

7575
01:25:48,060 --> 01:25:51,700
Since you put it that way, I will give one last chance

7576
01:25:51,700 --> 01:25:53,940
Yo! Bring it out!

7577
01:25:53,940 --> 01:25:55,150
What

7578
01:25:55,400 --> 01:25:56,870
This may just be what you were hoping for

7579
01:25:56,870 --> 01:25:58,570
Eh what!?

7580
01:25:58,570 --> 01:26:00,740
This is too kind for him...

7581
01:26:01,380 --> 01:26:03,250
A die?

7582
01:26:04,550 --> 01:26:07,480
Roll this die, if the result is SAFE

7583
01:26:07,480 --> 01:26:09,990
I will cancel the Thai kick for you

7584
01:26:08,620 --> 01:26:09,990
That's so kind

7585
01:26:09,990 --> 01:26:11,750
Take a good look at this die

7586
01:26:12,190 --> 01:26:16,290
5 sides are labeled SAFE and only 1 side is Thai kick

7587
01:26:14,970 --> 01:26:16,290
Wow that's lucky

7588
01:26:16,290 --> 01:26:19,590
There are no other dice in this world that could be nicer to you

7589
01:26:20,500 --> 01:26:23,800
So no excuse for what comes out of it

7590
01:26:23,270 --> 01:26:23,800
Yup, makes sense

7591
01:26:24,530 --> 01:26:27,800
Okay Ralph, for the fairness of this game

7592
01:26:27,800 --> 01:26:29,740
You roll the die!!

7593
01:26:28,800 --> 01:26:29,740
Oh that's good

7594
01:26:32,820 --> 01:26:33,930
Okay, please be seated

7595
01:26:34,060 --> 01:26:35,840
This is just so lucky

7596
01:26:41,750 --> 01:26:43,820
There is no cheating or trick to it

7597
01:26:43,820 --> 01:26:45,590
What are you doing?

7598
01:26:44,220 --> 01:26:47,140
I need to, need to just see it a little bit

7599
01:26:47,120 --> 01:26:48,120
What are you even talking about

7600
01:26:48,620 --> 01:26:51,960
To make sure there is no cheating in this

7601
01:26:49,610 --> 01:26:51,130
There isn't any

7602
01:26:51,280 --> 01:26:51,960
Alright

7603
01:26:51,940 --> 01:26:52,740
Yes

7604
01:26:52,940 --> 01:26:56,330
Everything comes down to this die

7605
01:26:55,930 --> 01:26:56,200
Okay

7606
01:26:56,310 --> 01:26:56,800
Counting on you

7607
01:26:56,670 --> 01:27:02,940
Thai kick die

7608
01:26:56,670 --> 01:27:02,940
The chance is 1 in 6

7609
01:26:57,170 --> 01:26:59,800
For the sake of fairness, I will roll the die

7610
01:26:59,320 --> 01:27:00,590
Okay

7611
01:26:59,520 --> 01:27:00,590
We are counting on you

7612
01:27:00,400 --> 01:27:02,400
Now, let's begin

7613
01:27:06,420 --> 01:27:09,880
SAFE Thai kick avoided

7614
01:27:07,290 --> 01:27:08,540
Oh!

7615
01:27:08,930 --> 01:27:09,980
SAFE!

7616
01:27:11,000 --> 01:27:12,160
Okay!

7617
01:27:12,560 --> 01:27:13,370
Okay?

7618
01:27:14,170 --> 01:27:14,670
It is okay right?

7619
01:27:14,670 --> 01:27:15,230
Yup

7620
01:27:15,230 --> 01:27:15,830
Yes

7621
01:27:16,650 --> 01:27:18,650
Thank you very...

7622
01:27:44,250 --> 01:27:45,950
Well, nothing can be done now

7623
01:27:45,950 --> 01:27:49,080
So this is something that could happen huh

7624
01:27:47,950 --> 01:27:49,940
This so cool

7625
01:27:49,580 --> 01:27:50,790
I didn't know that

7626
01:27:50,790 --> 01:27:54,020
I just saw all that happen

7627
01:27:54,020 --> 01:27:55,320
So cool

7628
01:27:54,020 --> 01:27:56,020
This is something that may happen

7629
01:27:56,060 --> 01:27:58,390
I honestly thought  Ralph made a boo boo there

7630
01:27:57,590 --> 01:27:59,290
Yeah yeah me too

7631
01:27:58,360 --> 01:27:59,390
True

7632
01:28:00,160 --> 01:28:02,030
Wait wait really really!?

7633
01:28:01,460 --> 01:28:02,260
Stay still

7634
01:28:02,260 --> 01:28:04,100
Stop twitching, you'll hurt somebody

7635
01:28:03,160 --> 01:28:04,100
It's really dangerous

7636
01:28:04,100 --> 01:28:04,880
Careful

7637
01:28:08,490 --> 01:28:08,620
Ahhhh!!

7638
01:28:08,620 --> 01:28:08,640
Ahhhh!!

7639
01:28:08,640 --> 01:28:08,650

7640
01:28:08,650 --> 01:28:08,670
Ahhhh!!

7641
01:28:08,670 --> 01:28:08,690
Ahhhh!!

7642
01:28:08,690 --> 01:28:08,700
Ahhhh!!

7643
01:28:08,700 --> 01:28:10,420
Ahhhh!!

7644
01:28:11,510 --> 01:28:12,840
Aa~ haa!! It hurts!!

7645
01:28:12,570 --> 01:28:13,480
Ahhhh!! Hurts!!

7646
01:28:15,190 --> 01:28:16,850
He's doing it, he's doing it

7647
01:28:17,210 --> 01:28:19,080
Doing it as always

7648
01:28:19,150 --> 01:28:21,620
Ohh I can't watch this anymore

7649
01:28:21,620 --> 01:28:23,350
Can we have a power outage now

7650
01:28:23,020 --> 01:28:24,720
Ouch ouch ouch

7651
01:28:25,350 --> 01:28:26,720
Ahhh it hurts

7652
01:28:26,720 --> 01:28:28,190
Ahhhh

7653
01:28:28,190 --> 01:28:30,130
He is actually smiling

7654
01:28:28,570 --> 01:28:30,130
He's doing it, he's doing it

7655
01:28:30,640 --> 01:28:36,770
7 hours past

7656
01:28:31,060 --> 01:28:33,600
It's been 7 hours since everything started,

7657
01:28:33,600 --> 01:28:36,770
The five will now go into the casino for their fortune

7658
01:28:36,820 --> 01:28:37,670
Okay everyone

7659
01:28:37,670 --> 01:28:40,640
Finally time to win a fortune at the casino

7660
01:28:39,380 --> 01:28:39,870
Yeah

7661
01:28:39,870 --> 01:28:42,050
Finally, oh my God

7662
01:28:42,000 --> 01:28:43,440
This is a special chance to win big

7663
01:28:43,590 --> 01:28:44,940
Here we go

7664
01:28:45,370 --> 01:28:46,220
This way

7665
01:28:46,220 --> 01:28:47,240
Hm?

7666
01:28:46,570 --> 01:28:47,240
What?

7667
01:28:47,880 --> 01:28:50,480
So empty...

7668
01:28:48,930 --> 01:28:50,480
Everyone, umm...

7669
01:28:50,480 --> 01:28:54,580
Casinos are a place where

7670
01:28:51,550 --> 01:28:54,580
Money moves in hundreds of millions every night

7671
01:28:54,580 --> 01:28:59,150
To make sure you are not holding weird stuff

7672
01:28:56,790 --> 01:28:59,150
SP will give you a body check

7673
01:28:59,150 --> 01:29:00,760
Let's go to the body check

7674
01:28:59,300 --> 01:29:09,260
Before enjoying the casino

7675
01:28:59,300 --> 01:29:09,260
Well trained SP will perform Body Check

7676
01:29:00,770 --> 01:29:02,720
Body check?

7677
01:29:03,070 --> 01:29:04,490
Body check?

7678
01:29:04,490 --> 01:29:04,910
This way

7679
01:29:07,430 --> 01:29:09,260
Everyone please stand in a line

7680
01:29:15,770 --> 01:29:19,540
Looks like nobody is here

7681
01:29:28,180 --> 01:29:31,990
Ken Matsudaira

7682
01:29:28,180 --> 01:29:31,990
SP Department Manager

7683
01:29:30,570 --> 01:29:33,050
Oh my God

7684
01:29:33,770 --> 01:29:35,770
Scared me

7685
01:29:42,150 --> 01:29:45,200
It's actually him

7686
01:29:43,210 --> 01:29:44,750
Yeah the real deal

7687
01:29:45,330 --> 01:29:47,770
The real deal...

7688
01:30:03,920 --> 01:30:06,720
I can't hold myself in front of that

7689
01:30:05,850 --> 01:30:09,120
Oh no no, it's because Fujiwara didn't say anything

7690
01:30:14,000 --> 01:30:15,200
I work as the SP* chief in this casino and my name is

7691
01:30:14,000 --> 01:30:19,740
T/N: SP means security (as in security police)

7692
01:30:15,200 --> 01:30:16,870
I work as the SP* chief in this casino and my name is

7693
01:30:16,870 --> 01:30:19,740
I work as the SP* chief in this casino and my name is

Ken

7696
01:30:32,130 --> 01:30:34,820
He really let that build up a lot

7697
01:30:34,820 --> 01:30:35,520
Yeah

7698
01:30:39,410 --> 01:30:40,990
This is pretty bad

7699
01:30:40,990 --> 01:30:42,190
And now

7700
01:30:42,530 --> 01:30:43,690
I will now start frisking you

7701
01:30:43,690 --> 01:30:45,660
I will now start frisking you

7702
01:30:46,000 --> 01:30:52,340
Frisking from the SP Chief

7703
01:30:47,780 --> 01:30:49,200
So he's playing a short person

7704
01:30:49,070 --> 01:30:50,420
Yeah

7705
01:30:59,230 --> 01:31:01,480
Grim... What a grim face

7706
01:31:01,480 --> 01:31:07,450
Frisk 1

7707
01:31:01,480 --> 01:31:07,450

7708
01:31:05,210 --> 01:31:06,780
Oh, frisking

7709
01:31:13,310 --> 01:31:19,500
You're

7710
01:31:14,860 --> 01:31:14,880
going bald!!

7711
01:31:14,880 --> 01:31:14,890

7719
01:31:19,500 --> 01:31:22,270
This guy is trouble

7720
01:31:21,910 --> 01:31:22,670
Definitely

7721
01:31:23,730 --> 01:31:25,130
This guy is too much

7722
01:31:29,040 --> 01:31:30,980
The way he said it, wow

7723
01:31:30,980 --> 01:31:32,330
I'm scared

7724
01:31:34,350 --> 01:31:40,650
Frisk 2

7725
01:31:34,350 --> 01:31:40,650
Matsumoto

7726
01:31:45,160 --> 01:31:45,340
Heavy breathing

7727
01:31:45,320 --> 01:31:46,060
Heavy breathing

7728
01:31:46,040 --> 01:31:48,560
Heavy breathing

7729
01:31:49,590 --> 01:31:52,430
Heavy breathing

7730
01:31:54,230 --> 01:31:56,330
Heavy breathing

7731
01:31:56,330 --> 01:32:01,370
Deeply interested in Matsumoto's chest muscles

7732
01:31:58,850 --> 01:31:59,800
Come on

7733
01:31:59,800 --> 01:32:03,010

7734
01:32:00,900 --> 01:32:03,010
Really bad

7735
01:32:03,010 --> 01:32:05,010
What was that?

7736
01:32:05,010 --> 01:32:07,940
This is rough

7737
01:32:05,980 --> 01:32:07,930

7738
01:32:07,930 --> 01:32:09,500
Harsh

7739
01:32:09,980 --> 01:32:10,750

All right nothing abnormal!!

7742
01:32:13,280 --> 01:32:15,250
Nothing abnormal...

7743
01:32:14,250 --> 01:32:21,160
Frisk 3

7744
01:32:14,250 --> 01:32:21,160
Hamada

7745
01:32:27,500 --> 01:32:34,200
Carefully checking Hamada's earlobes

7746
01:32:37,640 --> 01:32:37,660
What is that face he's making?

7747
01:32:37,660 --> 01:32:37,670

7767
01:32:42,530 --> 01:32:44,530
What was that all about?

7768
01:32:52,590 --> 01:32:53,320
All right everyone has nothing abnormal!!

7769
01:32:53,320 --> 01:32:56,230
All right everyone has nothing abnormal!!

7770
01:32:56,630 --> 01:32:57,460
There are also a few questions we need to ask

7771
01:32:57,460 --> 01:32:58,130
There are also a few questions we need to ask

7772
01:32:58,130 --> 01:33:00,160
There are also a few questions we need to ask

7773
01:33:00,430 --> 01:33:02,370
Fujiwara, can I leave that to you?

7774
01:33:01,160 --> 01:33:02,370
Yes

7775
01:33:02,370 --> 01:33:04,900
Fujiwara, can I leave that to you?

7776
01:33:03,420 --> 01:33:04,900
Yes, understood

7777
01:33:05,940 --> 01:33:08,410
It's a background check

7778
01:33:08,410 --> 01:33:09,470
Thank you

7779
01:33:10,410 --> 01:33:11,120
Well then,

7780
01:33:11,120 --> 01:33:13,120
Relax and have fun

7781
01:33:13,980 --> 01:33:16,880
Hiyah!!

7782
01:33:16,880 --> 01:33:22,690
Leaves the background check to Fujiwara and retreats

7783
01:33:19,380 --> 01:33:21,400
All right, since I got the orders

7784
01:33:21,400 --> 01:33:22,690
From the SP chief

7785
01:33:22,690 --> 01:33:24,170
I'll do the check

7786
01:33:24,920 --> 01:33:27,160
First is Matsumoto

7787
01:33:25,990 --> 01:33:26,820
Yes!

7788
01:33:27,160 --> 01:33:30,960
I think you like summer because t-shirts look good on you

7789
01:33:30,960 --> 01:33:32,400
When you think of summer

7790
01:33:32,400 --> 01:33:35,260
What 4-piece band comes to mind?

7791
01:33:33,150 --> 01:33:41,470
What 4-piece band do you associate with summer?

7792
01:33:33,160 --> 01:33:41,470
m -1242 -76.5 l 0 -76.5 0 -1.5 -1242 -1.5

7793
01:33:36,000 --> 01:33:41,470
I suppose TUBE?

7794
01:33:37,420 --> 01:33:37,580
Whaaaat!?

7795
01:33:37,580 --> 01:33:39,200
Whaaaat!?

7796
01:33:43,170 --> 01:33:49,480
Reacts to "TUBE" and makes a re-entrance

7797
01:33:45,890 --> 01:33:47,310
What did you just say?

7798
01:33:47,630 --> 01:33:49,130
What did you say?

7799
01:33:49,130 --> 01:33:50,110
Um,

Sorry

7843
01:34:04,240 --> 01:34:07,900
Are you mocking what I started this summer:

7844
01:34:07,900 --> 01:34:12,600
Are you mocking what I started this summer:

7845
01:34:08,110 --> 01:34:12,600
My YouTube Channel "Matsuken TUBE",

7846
01:34:12,600 --> 01:34:17,980
My YouTube Channel "Matsuken TUBE",

7847
01:34:12,870 --> 01:34:17,980
Whose subscriber numbers are making very little progress!?

7848
01:34:17,110 --> 01:34:17,980
I don't know anything about that

7849
01:34:18,390 --> 01:34:19,640
No, I really don't know

7850
01:34:19,640 --> 01:34:20,380

All right

7854
01:34:35,190 --> 01:34:37,680
Hiyah!!

7855
01:34:38,430 --> 01:34:40,130
This is too much

7856
01:34:38,430 --> 01:34:44,370
Remarks that hurt his feelings are punishable

7857
01:34:45,020 --> 01:34:46,280
That made no sense

7858
01:34:46,280 --> 01:34:47,300
Too much

7859
01:34:47,300 --> 01:34:49,170

That hurts

7863
01:34:55,310 --> 01:34:56,550
Don't say things that will hurt the SP chief's feelings

7864
01:34:56,550 --> 01:35:00,250
Don't say things that will hurt the SP chief's feelings

7865
01:34:58,900 --> 01:35:01,650
How are we supposed to know?

7866
01:34:58,900 --> 01:35:01,650
Right

7867
01:34:58,900 --> 01:35:01,650

Whaaaat!?

7878
01:35:21,370 --> 01:35:23,840
A finely crafted performance

7879

What did you say just now?

7880
01:35:23,840 --> 01:35:28,180
Is sensitive to the response "Shinkansen"

7881

Shinkansen

7882
01:35:25,560 --> 01:35:28,180

01:35:30,150 --> 01:35:30,200
You fool

7913
01:35:30,200 --> 01:35:30,230
You fool

7914
01:35:30,230 --> 01:35:31,580
You fool

7915
01:35:31,920 --> 01:35:37,390
Remarks that hurt his feelings are punishable

7916
01:35:37,750 --> 01:35:40,360
Are you making fun of

7917
01:35:40,360 --> 01:35:43,760
Are you making fun of

7918
01:35:40,520 --> 01:35:43,760
When I go to the film studio in Kyoto by Shinkansen

7919
01:35:43,760 --> 01:35:47,870
When I go to the film studio in Kyoto by Shinkansen

7920
01:35:43,930 --> 01:35:47,870
One out of every three times I oversleep and go to Okayama instead

7921
01:35:47,870 --> 01:35:54,470
One out of every three times I oversleep and go to Okayama instead

7922
01:35:48,030 --> 01:35:54,470
And I show up at the location three hours late!?

7923
01:35:51,700 --> 01:35:54,470
I don't know about that

7924
01:35:52,790 --> 01:35:54,470
I don't know

7925
01:35:54,700 --> 01:35:55,550
What about it!?

7926
01:35:55,540 --> 01:35:56,110
No

7927
01:35:56,110 --> 01:35:57,210
I'm not making fun you

7928
01:35:57,210 --> 01:36:01,810
I punish you!!

7929
01:36:02,390 --> 01:36:04,550
I really don't know

7930
01:36:04,900 --> 01:36:10,390
Don't ever speak the word Shinkansen again

7931
01:36:10,550 --> 01:36:13,040
Hiyah!!

7932
01:36:18,180 --> 01:36:20,260
Okay, okay

7933
01:36:18,890 --> 01:36:20,260
Okay

7934
01:36:19,360 --> 01:36:20,260
Yeah

7935
01:36:20,260 --> 01:36:21,630
We get a smack for that

7936
01:36:21,630 --> 01:36:23,900
Shinkansen is bad, too?

7937
01:36:27,850 --> 01:36:30,740
He should just stay here

7938
01:36:28,540 --> 01:36:29,450
Right

7939
01:36:29,450 --> 01:36:30,740
That's right

7940
01:36:30,740 --> 01:36:33,080
Next is Hamada

7941
01:36:31,740 --> 01:36:32,460
Eh? Okay

7942
01:36:32,460 --> 01:36:33,080
Eh? Okay

7943
01:36:33,080 --> 01:36:34,510
You have a rather funny face right?

7944
01:36:34,510 --> 01:36:36,680
You have a rather funny face right?

7945
01:36:36,680 --> 01:36:38,310
Regarding your face,

7946
01:36:37,800 --> 01:36:38,310
Yeah

7947
01:36:38,210 --> 01:36:50,460
What is the best part of your face?

7948
01:36:38,210 --> 01:36:50,460
m 0 729 l 1185 729 1185 813 0 813

7949
01:36:38,300 --> 01:36:40,280
The best part is where?

7950
01:36:40,270 --> 01:36:41,520
The best part is where?

7951
01:36:42,890 --> 01:36:44,550
Well, I don't think this

7952
01:36:44,550 --> 01:36:45,920
But if I had to say something

7953
01:36:45,920 --> 01:36:50,460
People say: my lips

7954
01:36:47,590 --> 01:36:50,460
Wh-

7955
01:36:47,930 --> 01:36:50,460
Wh-

7956
01:36:48,230 --> 01:36:50,460
Wh-

7957
01:36:48,560 --> 01:36:50,460
Whaaat!?

7958
01:36:54,030 --> 01:36:58,470
Is sensitive to the response "lips"

7959
01:36:57,280 --> 01:36:58,470
What did you say?

7960
01:36:58,900 --> 01:37:02,440
I said lips

7961
01:37:00,170 --> 01:37:02,440
Lips, you say?

7962
01:37:03,390 --> 01:37:04,010
You fool

7963
01:37:04,010 --> 01:37:04,020
You fool

7964
01:37:04,020 --> 01:37:04,040
You fool

7965
01:37:04,040 --> 01:37:04,060
You fool

7966
01:37:04,060 --> 01:37:04,070
You fool

7967
01:37:04,070 --> 01:37:04,090
You fool

7968
01:37:04,090 --> 01:37:04,110
You fool

7969
01:37:04,110 --> 01:37:04,120
You fool

7970
01:37:04,120 --> 01:37:04,140
You fool

7971
01:37:04,140 --> 01:37:04,160
You fool

7972
01:37:04,160 --> 01:37:04,170
You fool

7973
01:37:04,170 --> 01:37:04,190
You fool

7974
01:37:04,190 --> 01:37:04,210
You fool

7975
01:37:04,210 --> 01:37:04,220
You fool

7976
01:37:04,220 --> 01:37:04,240
You fool

7977
01:37:04,240 --> 01:37:04,260
You fool

7978
01:37:04,260 --> 01:37:04,270
You fool

7979
01:37:04,270 --> 01:37:04,290
You fool

7980
01:37:04,290 --> 01:37:04,310
You fool

7981
01:37:04,310 --> 01:37:04,320
You fool

7982
01:37:04,320 --> 01:37:04,340
You fool

7983
01:37:04,340 --> 01:37:04,360
You fool

7984
01:37:04,360 --> 01:37:04,370
You fool

7985
01:37:04,370 --> 01:37:04,390
You fool

7986
01:37:04,390 --> 01:37:04,410
You fool

7987
01:37:04,410 --> 01:37:04,420
You fool

7988
01:37:04,420 --> 01:37:04,440
You fool

7989
01:37:04,440 --> 01:37:04,460
You fool

7990
01:37:04,460 --> 01:37:04,470
You fool

7991
01:37:04,470 --> 01:37:04,490
You fool

7992
01:37:04,490 --> 01:37:05,710
You fool

7993
01:37:16,120 --> 01:37:23,490
Instead of a punishment, a happy dance

7994
01:37:19,690 --> 01:37:21,420
What is this?

7995
01:37:23,990 --> 01:37:26,160
This has a dance to it?

7996
01:37:23,990 --> 01:37:30,730
T/N: The music playing is the theme to The Unfettered Shogun (Abarenbō Shōgun), which Ken Matsudaira starred in

7997
01:37:28,730 --> 01:37:30,730
It's pretty long

7998
01:37:38,370 --> 01:37:39,610
Guess there's nothing for "lips"

7999
01:37:40,030 --> 01:37:41,240
It was just a dance

8000
01:37:41,240 --> 01:37:43,010
Nothing for "lips"

8001
01:37:50,720 --> 01:37:52,070
Don't move!

8002
01:37:52,070 --> 01:37:53,590
Where's the vault!?

8003
01:37:53,590 --> 01:37:59,650
Masked burglars assault

8004
01:37:54,020 --> 01:37:55,510
Get the money!

8005
01:37:55,510 --> 01:37:56,690
Who is this?

8006
01:37:56,930 --> 01:37:58,740
I will punish evil!

8007
01:37:58,740 --> 01:37:59,660
What is this guy?

8008
01:38:00,230 --> 01:38:01,600
Get him!!

8009
01:38:01,930 --> 01:38:07,570
The SP Chief punishes evil

8010
01:38:18,320 --> 01:38:22,890
In the middle of the sword fight he glares at Matsumoto

8011
01:38:21,270 --> 01:38:22,890
He glared at me so intensely

8012
01:38:23,450 --> 01:38:25,510
Glared at me so intensely

8013
01:38:30,080 --> 01:38:31,430
That was amazing

8014
01:38:32,760 --> 01:38:35,300
As expected

8015
01:38:51,310 --> 01:38:53,250
They won't die at all

8016
01:38:53,580 --> 01:38:57,990
The masked burglars are persistent

8017
01:38:57,990 --> 01:39:01,120
They aren't dying at all, what's with that

8018
01:38:57,990 --> 01:39:01,120
They're all cut up

8019
01:39:04,990 --> 01:39:07,810
(labored breathing)

8020
01:39:06,260 --> 01:39:07,810
(labored breathing)

8021
01:39:10,690 --> 01:39:12,340
Well, it is 3 on 1

8022
01:39:17,070 --> 01:39:23,550
The limit of the SP chief's physical strength nears

8023
01:39:23,110 --> 01:39:24,560
He's gotten quite tired

8024
01:39:23,560 --> 01:39:26,580
(labored breathing)

8025
01:39:24,560 --> 01:39:26,580
(labored breathing)

8026
01:39:24,560 --> 01:39:26,580
Quite tired

8027
01:39:25,500 --> 01:39:26,580
(labored breathing)

8028
01:39:30,050 --> 01:39:32,320
He really should kill them

8029
01:39:35,560 --> 01:39:36,530
He's already killed them right?

8030
01:39:36,530 --> 01:39:38,060
This guy's strong, let's run!!

8031
01:39:37,650 --> 01:39:38,720
Oh,

8032
01:39:38,060 --> 01:39:39,330
This guy's strong, let's run!!

8033
01:39:38,720 --> 01:39:39,980
I mean, finally

8034
01:39:40,310 --> 01:39:42,770
I won't let you get away!!

8035
01:39:44,400 --> 01:39:45,420
What?

8036
01:39:44,700 --> 01:39:50,970
The battle continues even after they leave the room

8037
01:39:45,420 --> 01:39:45,970
Eh? Still?

8038
01:39:45,970 --> 01:39:47,650
Eh? Still?

8039
01:39:48,490 --> 01:39:50,120
It ends here!

8040
01:39:52,560 --> 01:39:54,560
What?

8041
01:39:53,280 --> 01:39:54,560
Eh?

8042
01:39:55,280 --> 01:39:57,310
Did he get cut down?

8043
01:39:55,280 --> 01:40:01,020
Has the SP chief died at his post?

8044
01:39:56,010 --> 01:39:57,310
Eh?

8045
01:39:59,670 --> 01:40:01,020
The SP chief is done for

8046
01:40:02,570 --> 01:40:04,750
This isn't really the time for casino. Let's go back

8047
01:40:04,750 --> 01:40:08,090
This isn't really the time for casino. Let's go back

8048
01:40:08,190 --> 01:40:10,490
Hold on

8049
01:40:10,500 --> 01:40:11,200
We're only just getting started!!

8050
01:40:11,200 --> 01:40:12,300
We're only just getting started!!

8051
01:40:14,920 --> 01:40:16,150
Oh he's there

8052
01:40:17,470 --> 01:40:18,710
Sorry, sorry, please come over here

8053
01:40:18,710 --> 01:40:20,470
Sorry, sorry, please come over here

8054
01:40:21,920 --> 01:40:23,510
Sorry, sorry, please come over here

8055
01:40:23,510 --> 01:40:24,340
This is amazing

8056
01:40:24,340 --> 01:40:25,960
Please take your seats

8057
01:40:24,340 --> 01:40:29,650
Supposedly-dead Matsudaira reappears on the stage in new attire

8058
01:40:25,960 --> 01:40:29,650
We're really grateful for this, but...

8059
01:40:26,500 --> 01:40:27,750
Amazing

8060
01:40:27,750 --> 01:40:29,650
Front row seats

8061
01:40:31,340 --> 01:40:32,170
Amazing

8062
01:40:32,550 --> 01:40:34,320
How was it?

8063
01:40:34,660 --> 01:40:35,220
Did you think Matsudaira was dead?

8064
01:40:35,220 --> 01:40:39,360
Did you think Matsudaira was dead?

8065
01:40:36,860 --> 01:40:39,010
Yes, we certainly did

8066
01:40:39,690 --> 01:40:40,960
Actually, this is our casino's usual surprise

8067
01:40:40,960 --> 01:40:43,830
Actually, this is our casino's usual surprise

8068
01:40:44,260 --> 01:40:44,450
Heipo Casino's usual surprise

8069
01:40:44,260 --> 01:40:44,450
Prank Show

8070
01:40:44,450 --> 01:40:51,240
Heipo Casino's usual surprise

8071
01:40:44,450 --> 01:40:51,240
Prank Show

8072
01:40:48,940 --> 01:40:51,240
Understood

8073
01:40:51,240 --> 01:40:53,940
Matsudaira did not die

8074
01:40:53,940 --> 01:40:54,940
As you can see I'm very much alive

8075
01:40:54,940 --> 01:40:56,610
As you can see I'm very much alive

8076
01:40:56,940 --> 01:40:57,180
Olé!!

8077
01:40:57,180 --> 01:40:58,210
Olé!!

8078
01:40:58,350 --> 01:41:03,680
Do not laugh version

8079
01:40:58,350 --> 01:41:03,680
Matsuken Samba

8080
01:41:00,330 --> 01:41:01,420
Here it is

8081
01:41:02,820 --> 01:41:03,920
Splendid

8082
01:41:04,770 --> 01:41:06,040
I haven't seen this in a long time

8083
01:41:08,820 --> 01:41:16,400
Too many rehearsals, too many lines, too much to remember

8084
01:41:16,440 --> 01:41:20,200
I accepted the offer without giving it much thought,

8085
01:41:20,210 --> 01:41:25,770
And regretted my decision on the first day of rehearsal

8086
01:41:25,840 --> 01:41:33,380
A director in his 20s criticized my acting

8087
01:41:33,450 --> 01:41:37,140
With a smirk, I was handed that horse costume

8088
01:41:37,150 --> 01:41:43,020
And I was brimming with anger

8089
01:41:43,160 --> 01:41:50,500
Gaki, Gaki is messing with Matsuken

8090
01:41:50,710 --> 01:41:59,770
Gaki, Gaki is messing with actors

8091
01:41:51,880 --> 01:41:54,030
That's not true

8092
01:41:59,810 --> 01:42:03,910
T/N: Referring to Yoshiko of the comedy duo Gambareru-ya

8093
01:41:59,810 --> 01:42:03,910
They gave me a shared green room, seated me next to Yoshiko

8094
01:42:03,940 --> 01:42:09,580
The waiting time was so long that, I dozed off twice

8095
01:42:10,000 --> 01:42:22,720
Add another 30,000 Yen to my payment. My fee!

8096
01:42:17,600 --> 01:42:19,410
He's fine with 30,000 Yen

8097
01:42:25,240 --> 01:42:25,870
What!

8098
01:42:25,870 --> 01:42:26,700
Look at him

8099
01:42:26,700 --> 01:42:28,140
What's he doing?

8100
01:42:28,140 --> 01:42:35,740
No matter what happens, Matsuken will sing

8101
01:42:35,830 --> 01:42:45,150
Screw it, Matsuken will dance

8102
01:42:45,150 --> 01:42:49,190
Oh, even in these times, let's all have a laugh

8103
01:42:49,260 --> 01:42:55,030
As long as we're alive, the future will come

8104
01:42:55,230 --> 01:42:58,700
Let's go, Japan, Let's go

8105
01:42:58,930 --> 01:43:07,540
Let's go everyone, Japan!

8106
01:43:09,970 --> 01:43:10,640
Great

8107
01:43:10,640 --> 01:43:12,290
Wonderful

8108
01:43:15,400 --> 01:43:17,850
Fine with the "out", but geez...

8109
01:43:17,850 --> 01:43:20,100
That was a wonderful performance

8110
01:43:20,100 --> 01:43:21,840
Really

8111
01:43:28,800 --> 01:43:30,760
They're saying goodbye to us, now?

8112
01:43:30,760 --> 01:43:32,450
Thank you very much

8113
01:43:32,600 --> 01:43:34,230
That was amazing to see

8114
01:43:33,300 --> 01:43:34,230
Yes

8115
01:43:34,230 --> 01:43:37,070
He had a big role

8116
01:43:37,570 --> 01:43:42,040
8 Hours In

8117
01:43:37,600 --> 01:43:42,040
The five return to the room and take a short break

8118
01:43:47,550 --> 01:43:49,720
You're really focusing on the counting

8119
01:43:52,220 --> 01:43:54,860
Can you treat me?

8120
01:43:54,860 --> 01:43:56,860
No

8121
01:43:58,130 --> 01:43:59,330
Shall we play Imaginary Half-Japanese Celebrity Naming contest?

8122
01:43:59,330 --> 01:44:00,690
Shall we play Imaginary Half-Japanese Celebrity Naming contest?

8123
01:44:00,690 --> 01:44:02,530
Shall we play Imaginary Half-Japanese Celebrity Naming contest?

8124
01:44:02,530 --> 01:44:04,870
Shall we play Imaginary Half-Japanese Celebrity Naming contest?

8125
01:44:03,960 --> 01:44:05,480
What happens with that?

8126
01:44:04,870 --> 01:44:06,580
Winner gets a 1000 Yen

8127
01:44:07,960 --> 01:44:08,500
Ok

8128
01:44:08,500 --> 01:44:09,590
Do we all play?

8129
01:44:08,500 --> 01:44:13,910
1000 Heipo on the line

8130
01:44:08,500 --> 01:44:13,910
Imaginary Half-Japanese Celebrity Naming

8131
01:44:09,590 --> 01:44:11,330
Sure. We can play one-on-one, too

8132
01:44:12,120 --> 01:44:13,370
All right

8133
01:44:13,370 --> 01:44:13,910
I'll start

8134
01:44:13,910 --> 01:44:14,740
Ok

8135
01:44:15,480 --> 01:44:18,850
Henry Sasataki

8136
01:44:19,110 --> 01:44:20,180
Minajo Yoshikawa

8137
01:44:20,180 --> 01:44:22,180
Minajo Yoshikawa

8138
01:44:23,620 --> 01:44:25,290
Village Takemura

8139
01:44:25,290 --> 01:44:27,220
Village Takemura

8140
01:44:31,620 --> 01:44:33,090
That's a weird name

8141
01:44:33,090 --> 01:44:34,210
Village!

8142
01:44:35,000 --> 01:44:37,760
It felt like you got influenced by what I said

8143
01:44:37,760 --> 01:44:39,320
I wasn't influenced at all

8144
01:44:40,330 --> 01:44:42,500
There's no way I would be influenced

8145
01:44:45,710 --> 01:44:46,270
Mosako Satake

8146
01:44:46,270 --> 01:44:47,370
Mosako Satake

8147
01:44:47,370 --> 01:44:47,970
What did you say?

8148
01:44:47,970 --> 01:44:49,810
Mosako Satake

8149
01:44:49,810 --> 01:44:51,880
That one is no good right?

8150
01:44:51,880 --> 01:44:54,410
What kind of a name is Mosako Satake?

8151
01:44:59,660 --> 01:45:01,320
Can you stop this game please?

8152
01:45:01,320 --> 01:45:02,800
What is this?

8153
01:45:01,990 --> 01:45:03,770
What sort of a game is this?

8154
01:45:05,960 --> 01:45:08,860
With this I get 1000 Heipo right?

8155
01:45:09,560 --> 01:45:10,960
Village and Mosako cancel each other out and make it even

8156
01:45:10,960 --> 01:45:11,870
Village and Mosako cancel each other out and make it even

8157
01:45:11,870 --> 01:45:13,500
Village and Mosako cancel each other out and make it even

8158
01:45:14,010 --> 01:45:17,190
Making others laugh is not the point

8159
01:45:17,470 --> 01:45:18,370
If you laugh you should have to pay 1000 Heipo

8160
01:45:18,370 --> 01:45:20,340
If you laugh you should have to pay 1000 Heipo

8161
01:45:19,440 --> 01:45:21,380
Yeah, you can't laugh

8162
01:45:20,400 --> 01:45:22,580
You can't laugh. You got in our way

8163
01:45:22,810 --> 01:45:24,380
Give me the money!!

8164
01:45:24,710 --> 01:45:26,080
Let's start from now onward

8165
01:45:24,920 --> 01:45:27,060
I won't laugh now

8166
01:45:26,220 --> 01:45:28,310
You gotta start that from now

8167
01:45:28,780 --> 01:45:32,290
Because you guys just started this on your own

8168
01:45:30,460 --> 01:45:31,490
Exactly

8169
01:45:33,790 --> 01:45:35,660
Shejarre Kumiko

8170
01:45:35,660 --> 01:45:37,990
Shejarre Kumiko

8171
01:45:39,090 --> 01:45:40,730
Minagawa Go

8172
01:45:40,730 --> 01:45:41,900
Minagawa Go

8173
01:45:42,260 --> 01:45:44,230
That's a Japanese name

8174
01:45:44,660 --> 01:45:49,300
And there actually is a Go Minagawa

8175
01:45:51,920 --> 01:45:54,560
You can't do that

8176
01:45:55,440 --> 01:45:57,640
You can't do that!!

8177
01:46:00,610 --> 01:46:02,380
I get 1000 Heipo for that

8178
01:46:02,580 --> 01:46:04,650
Hamada should pay up, too

8179
01:46:03,940 --> 01:46:05,050
Why should I?

8180
01:46:04,650 --> 01:46:06,620
Because you laughed. I'm paying, too

8181
01:46:06,620 --> 01:46:09,720
This makes no sense, does it?

8182
01:46:07,870 --> 01:46:09,720
No, it does

8183
01:46:09,870 --> 01:46:10,770
Here's mine

8184
01:46:10,770 --> 01:46:12,410
For real?

8185
01:46:10,770 --> 01:46:12,410
What do you mean?

8186
01:46:13,060 --> 01:46:15,060
Whom should I pay?

8187
01:46:15,060 --> 01:46:17,130
I get this one right?

8188
01:46:15,700 --> 01:46:17,130
Yes, you take this

8189
01:46:17,130 --> 01:46:19,400
I take this

8190
01:46:19,600 --> 01:46:21,600
What!?

8191
01:46:20,400 --> 01:46:21,600
Because you laughed

8192
01:46:22,370 --> 01:46:24,700
How does that make sense?

8193
01:46:24,700 --> 01:46:29,410
You used Go Minagawa's name

8194
01:46:27,700 --> 01:46:29,410
No, it's not that

8195
01:46:29,410 --> 01:46:31,240
You only reversed the first and last name, right?

8196
01:46:31,240 --> 01:46:32,380
No, I did not

8197
01:46:31,440 --> 01:46:34,150
That one was bad

8198
01:46:32,380 --> 01:46:34,150
That was bad

8199
01:46:34,150 --> 01:46:36,480
1000 Heipo shouldn't cut it

8200
01:46:35,140 --> 01:46:35,970
I agree

8201
01:46:35,970 --> 01:46:37,620
But I think...

8202
01:46:37,620 --> 01:46:39,420
Stop involving us

8203
01:46:39,420 --> 01:46:41,110
Just do it among yourselves

8204
01:46:41,000 --> 01:46:42,420
Yeah

8205
01:46:41,110 --> 01:46:42,660
You're saying we laughed, but

8206
01:46:42,660 --> 01:46:44,020
It's because you're saying weird stuff

8207
01:46:44,960 --> 01:46:46,530
But you know, if we don't bet a lot, it's not gonna be that fun

8208
01:46:46,530 --> 01:46:48,500
But you know, if we don't bet a lot, it's not gonna be that fun

8209
01:46:49,160 --> 01:46:50,000
Hey, you guys should bet too

8210
01:46:50,000 --> 01:46:51,460
Hey, you guys should bet too

8211
01:46:51,460 --> 01:46:54,000
Everyone put in 1000 each

8212
01:46:54,000 --> 01:46:56,000
Let's do winner take all

8213
01:46:55,580 --> 01:46:56,640
Good idea

8214
01:46:57,900 --> 01:46:59,290
Imaginary Half-Japanese Celebrity Naming contest

8215
01:46:57,900 --> 01:47:04,080
Imaginary Half-Japanese Celebrity Naming contest

8216
01:46:57,900 --> 01:47:04,080
Winner take all with 5 people

8217
01:46:58,940 --> 01:46:59,900
Yes

8218
01:46:59,290 --> 01:47:00,850
Ok, let's do it

8219
01:47:03,370 --> 01:47:05,030
You take too much time in answering

8220
01:47:05,030 --> 01:47:07,950
Ok, nobody is allowed to take a long time

8221
01:47:08,780 --> 01:47:11,380
What if you end up laughing during this?

8222
01:47:11,380 --> 01:47:13,750
Does it mean that that person bows out?

8223
01:47:13,080 --> 01:47:14,270
Yes, let's do that

8224
01:47:15,220 --> 01:47:17,840
That person is out of the race

8225
01:47:17,840 --> 01:47:19,060
So one person will get—

8226
01:47:19,060 --> 01:47:21,460
This is pretty huge

8227
01:47:20,030 --> 01:47:21,460
This is pretty huge

8228
01:47:20,520 --> 01:47:21,460
All right

8229
01:47:22,380 --> 01:47:23,380
That's true

8230
01:47:24,900 --> 01:47:26,200
Shall we start with Endo?

8231
01:47:25,490 --> 01:47:26,200
From me, then?

8232
01:47:26,200 --> 01:47:27,860
Anti-clockwise from there

8233
01:47:28,410 --> 01:47:29,220
Here we go

8234
01:47:29,700 --> 01:47:31,710
Jerry Nakamura

8235
01:47:34,910 --> 01:47:36,780
Oh, my turn

8236
01:47:37,640 --> 01:47:39,850
James Noda

8237
01:47:40,310 --> 01:47:45,950
James Onoda...

8238
01:47:40,310 --> 01:47:45,950
Kome Kome Club

8239
01:47:45,950 --> 01:47:47,290
I said Noda

8240
01:47:46,660 --> 01:47:47,970
You did, but Onoda...

8241
01:47:49,560 --> 01:47:50,810
Hold on

8242
01:47:51,110 --> 01:47:53,630
That's not good

8243
01:47:53,630 --> 01:47:55,900
I did not say Onoda

8244
01:47:55,310 --> 01:47:56,660
That's true, but...

8245
01:47:56,660 --> 01:47:58,430
He's not a half-Japanese celebrity

8246
01:47:58,180 --> 01:48:00,050
Yeah, he's not half-Japanese

8247
01:48:01,270 --> 01:48:03,770
There's gotta be a half-Japanese person with that kinda name

8248
01:48:02,890 --> 01:48:04,340
You did say Noda, but

8249
01:48:05,170 --> 01:48:10,110
Kome Kome Club

8250
01:48:05,170 --> 01:48:10,110
You clearly got it from James Onoda

8251
01:48:06,140 --> 01:48:10,110
And both of yours started with "Ja-", so you should avoid that

8252
01:48:10,110 --> 01:48:13,210
Don't get too influenced by others

8253
01:48:11,320 --> 01:48:13,210
Ok, understood

8254
01:48:13,510 --> 01:48:15,580
You took too long as well

8255
01:48:15,580 --> 01:48:16,780
Understood

8256
01:48:17,450 --> 01:48:19,050
Let's start with Hamada again

8257
01:48:27,930 --> 01:48:32,170
How slow are you!?

8258
01:48:36,150 --> 01:48:37,980
I don't like this

8259
01:48:46,710 --> 01:48:49,150
This is such a loss here

8260
01:48:48,510 --> 01:48:49,440
Yes, I agree

8261
01:48:54,510 --> 01:48:56,150
What do we do now?

8262
01:48:57,790 --> 01:48:58,860
Let's start with Endo, can't start with this guy

8263
01:48:58,860 --> 01:49:00,930
Let's start with Endo, can't start with this guy

8264
01:49:01,430 --> 01:49:03,600
Let's decide the winner with this turn

8265
01:49:02,890 --> 01:49:04,210
Let's decide it

8266
01:49:03,140 --> 01:49:04,220
I agree

8267
01:49:04,550 --> 01:49:05,780
I'll start

8268
01:49:06,900 --> 01:49:08,300
Jesper Satake

8269
01:49:08,300 --> 01:49:09,670
Jesper Satake

8270
01:49:15,570 --> 01:49:18,100
No, I was...

8271
01:49:20,410 --> 01:49:22,220
I want us to keep it going

8272
01:49:21,220 --> 01:49:22,220
I'm sorry

8273
01:49:22,520 --> 01:49:23,330
Really sorry

8274
01:49:25,790 --> 01:49:27,990
How about we start from Tanaka?

8275
01:49:27,130 --> 01:49:27,990
Ok

8276
01:49:27,860 --> 01:49:28,880
Yes, let's do that

8277
01:49:34,430 --> 01:49:37,700
Eva Yumi

8278
01:49:39,000 --> 01:49:39,700
Tandoori Kimura

8279
01:49:39,700 --> 01:49:41,970
Tandoori Kimura

8280
01:49:42,100 --> 01:49:44,100
That's a type of chicken

8281
01:49:49,630 --> 01:49:51,780
Do it properly guys

8282
01:49:53,080 --> 01:49:55,350
That's tandoori chicken

8283
01:49:59,920 --> 01:50:02,160
That Indian dish

8284
01:50:02,160 --> 01:50:05,570
This sucks, this sucks

8285
01:50:05,570 --> 01:50:06,690
This sucks

8286
01:50:06,690 --> 01:50:08,030
Getting hit for something like this is not funny at all

8287
01:50:08,030 --> 01:50:11,460
Getting hit for something like this is not funny at all

8288
01:50:12,110 --> 01:50:15,460
For something like this. My ass hurts, already

8289
01:50:15,900 --> 01:50:17,120
Ah, that was funny

8290
01:50:19,550 --> 01:50:24,970
9 hours in

8291
01:50:20,150 --> 01:50:24,970
It's been nine hours since they got to Las Vegas. And as the sun is setting...

8292
01:50:25,320 --> 01:50:31,990
The five go meet the Legendary Dealer, who will teach them the basics of gambling

8293
01:50:26,990 --> 01:50:31,980
Legendary Dealer

8294
01:50:26,990 --> 01:50:31,980
Legendary Dealer

8295
01:50:26,990 --> 01:50:31,980
Legendary Dealer

8296
01:50:32,350 --> 01:50:37,390
This easily irritable Legendary Dealer - Who is this person!?

8297
01:50:38,400 --> 01:50:41,120
Legendary Dealer, huh...

8298
01:50:40,160 --> 01:50:42,390
The Legendary Dealer... he's not here, huh?

8299
01:50:43,580 --> 01:50:45,210
He's kinda scary, right?

8300
01:50:44,860 --> 01:50:45,190
Yeah

8301
01:50:49,870 --> 01:50:53,270
Shingo Katori

8302
01:50:49,870 --> 01:50:53,270
The Legendary Dealer

8303
01:50:50,550 --> 01:50:53,440
You scared me man, c'mon!

8304
01:50:53,440 --> 01:50:56,500
What the hell is this?

8305
01:51:00,040 --> 01:51:01,740
Something's peeking out

8306
01:51:00,380 --> 01:51:04,510
Underwear

01:51:00,380 --> 01:51:04,510

8308
01:51:00,880 --> 01:51:03,360
We can see them

8309
01:51:01,740 --> 01:51:03,980
They're showing

8310
01:51:08,750 --> 01:51:10,440
That scared me

8311
01:51:11,490 --> 01:51:13,460
This is the legendary dealer, Katori

8312
01:51:13,460 --> 01:51:14,990
I'll come get you later

8313
01:51:14,990 --> 01:51:19,360
He's really staring at us...

8314
01:51:24,950 --> 01:51:27,850
Woah, woah

8315
01:51:24,970 --> 01:51:26,970
Hey, woah

8316
01:51:29,670 --> 01:51:33,510
Is this your first time at this casino?

8317
01:51:32,120 --> 01:51:33,520
Yeah

8318
01:51:34,880 --> 01:51:37,450
Welcome to the Heipo Casino!

8319
01:51:35,440 --> 01:51:37,450
Welcome to the Heipo Casino!

8320
01:51:40,920 --> 01:51:47,120
Just like last year, his outfit is very unique

8321
01:51:52,490 --> 01:52:00,220
Casino First Timer's Ceremony

8322
01:51:52,490 --> 01:52:00,220
Casino First Timer's Ceremony

8323
01:51:52,490 --> 01:52:00,220
Casino First Timer's Ceremony

8324
01:51:52,490 --> 01:52:00,220
Casino First Timer's Ceremony

8325
01:52:11,150 --> 01:52:13,150
Ah

8326
01:52:13,920 --> 01:52:20,390
The Legendary Dealer is proud of his big mouth

8327
01:52:18,400 --> 01:52:19,840
Are you stupid?

8328
01:52:18,400 --> 01:52:19,840
What are you doing?

8329
01:52:21,160 --> 01:52:23,120
What are you doing, sir?

8330
01:52:21,160 --> 01:52:23,160
That's dangerous

8331
01:52:23,120 --> 01:52:24,770
And it's not making much sound

8332
01:52:25,930 --> 01:52:29,330
Harmonica

8333
01:52:25,930 --> 01:52:29,330

8334
01:52:27,180 --> 01:52:28,850
No way, no way

8335
01:52:28,860 --> 01:52:31,170
You should stop, hey

8336
01:52:29,310 --> 01:52:31,900
Ow ow ow no no no

8337
01:52:31,900 --> 01:52:33,900
Ouch ouch ouch

8338
01:52:32,770 --> 01:52:40,280
Bells + Harmonica Combo

8339
01:52:35,100 --> 01:52:38,140
Amazing...

8340
01:52:36,950 --> 01:52:39,040
What a brute force gag

8341
01:52:42,010 --> 01:52:44,210
There's no sound

8342
01:52:44,210 --> 01:52:46,160
Just slightly... Just a little more?

8343
01:52:44,210 --> 01:52:46,870
There's no sound at all coming out

8344
01:52:47,420 --> 01:52:52,990
The Harmonica is Somewhat Lacking

8345
01:52:48,150 --> 01:52:50,120
It's not working, sir

8346
01:52:51,070 --> 01:52:53,520
Your perseverance really comes through, though

8347
01:52:54,460 --> 01:52:55,810
Your perseverance

8348
01:52:55,140 --> 01:52:57,140
The air isn't going through it, though

8349
01:52:57,140 --> 01:52:58,210
Your perseverance...

8350
01:53:01,830 --> 01:53:05,130
All the air was just escaping out the sides

8351
01:53:02,800 --> 01:53:03,800
Just a bit more...

8352
01:53:05,270 --> 01:53:08,040
You should have just chosen one

8353
01:53:08,850 --> 01:53:10,310
There's more sound when he inhales

8354
01:53:10,310 --> 01:53:14,680
Why are you entering and exiting the table?

8355
01:53:11,260 --> 01:53:13,940
What is this movement?

8356
01:53:19,980 --> 01:53:21,780
Peek

8357
01:53:20,370 --> 01:53:22,980
They're short, aren't they?

8358
01:53:22,990 --> 01:53:25,190
Where are you looking?

8359
01:53:25,190 --> 01:53:25,220
Look at the bells!!

8360
01:53:25,220 --> 01:53:25,250
Look at the bells!!

8361
01:53:25,250 --> 01:53:25,290
Look at the bells!!

8362
01:53:25,290 --> 01:53:25,320
Look at the bells!!

8363
01:53:25,320 --> 01:53:25,350
Look at the bells!!

8364
01:53:25,350 --> 01:53:25,390
Look at the bells!!

8365
01:53:25,390 --> 01:53:27,760
Look at the bells!!

8366
01:53:27,760 --> 01:53:33,490
Look at the Bells, Not His Underpants

8367
01:53:28,840 --> 01:53:30,090
We were looking at them

8368
01:53:29,370 --> 01:53:30,090
We were, right?

8369
01:53:31,760 --> 01:53:33,490
Ahh, that's enough

8370
01:53:34,730 --> 01:53:35,030
Huh?

8371
01:53:37,770 --> 01:53:39,200
Over here!!

8372
01:53:39,530 --> 01:53:47,010
Changing Spots and Learning Casino Basics

8373
01:53:39,570 --> 01:53:41,190
Oh...

8374
01:53:41,290 --> 01:53:42,770
Oh, right

8375
01:53:42,950 --> 01:53:44,220
He's really gonna teach us

8376
01:53:44,220 --> 01:53:46,210
Right? We were told we'd be learning

8377
01:53:46,540 --> 01:53:46,990
Right?

8378
01:53:47,010 --> 01:53:49,910
What a difficult person

8379
01:53:48,810 --> 01:53:49,910
Kinda, yeah

8380
01:53:50,910 --> 01:53:52,710
So that's how it is

8381
01:53:53,950 --> 01:53:56,250
Because my skirt is so short

8382
01:53:56,250 --> 01:54:00,620
You were looking for when my skirt

8383
01:53:57,420 --> 01:54:00,620
Would slide up to look at my underpants

8384
01:54:00,720 --> 01:54:02,120
Not at all

8385
01:54:02,120 --> 01:54:03,690
What a gross bunch

8386
01:54:04,030 --> 01:54:04,060
Don't look at my underpants!!

8387
01:54:04,060 --> 01:54:04,090
Don't look at my underpants!!

8388
01:54:04,090 --> 01:54:04,130
Don't look at my underpants!!

8389
01:54:04,130 --> 01:54:04,160
Don't look at my underpants!!

8390
01:54:04,160 --> 01:54:04,190
Don't look at my underpants!!

8391
01:54:04,190 --> 01:54:04,230
Don't look at my underpants!!

8392
01:54:04,230 --> 01:54:06,460
Don't look at my underpants!!

8393
01:54:07,180 --> 01:54:08,700
Huh!?

8394
01:54:09,030 --> 01:54:14,500
Excessively Hates People Looking At His Underpants

8395
01:54:11,650 --> 01:54:13,800
Never mind. Pants it is

8396
01:54:14,700 --> 01:54:17,140
Bring me my pants!!

8397
01:54:18,390 --> 01:54:19,520
Yes, sir

8398
01:54:20,240 --> 01:54:23,490
Kentarou Kokado

Outfit Change from Skirt to Pants

8401
01:54:28,670 --> 01:54:34,870
Sir, I brought you pants. I'm not sure of the size, so could you try them on first?

8402
01:54:34,270 --> 01:54:34,870
Thanks

8403
01:54:35,090 --> 01:54:37,890
I have a bad feeling

8404
01:54:36,570 --> 01:54:37,890
Yeah

8405
01:54:37,890 --> 01:54:39,880
Tell me when you've got them on

8406
01:54:37,890 --> 01:54:44,000
Like Rocchi's "Changing Room" Skit?

8407
01:54:38,730 --> 01:54:39,530
Okay

8408
01:54:41,950 --> 01:54:44,670
Is there gonna be any gambling to this?

8409
01:54:44,280 --> 01:54:46,270
Yes, that'd be nice

8410
01:54:46,840 --> 01:54:49,840
How is it?

8411
01:54:47,650 --> 01:54:49,670
Yeah. There we go

8412
01:54:49,840 --> 01:54:53,740
Did you put them on?

8413
01:54:51,960 --> 01:54:53,740
Yeeeah

8414
01:54:53,740 --> 01:54:57,280
Do these match my top?

8415
01:54:55,530 --> 01:54:57,280
Oh, do they not match?

8416
01:54:57,280 --> 01:55:00,280
Is this okay, maybe?

8417
01:54:58,610 --> 01:55:00,280
Oh, they don't quite work?

8418
01:55:00,280 --> 01:55:03,350
Can we take a look then?

8419
01:55:00,930 --> 01:55:02,230
Well, yeah

8420
01:55:07,720 --> 01:55:08,990
Oh no!!

8421
01:55:08,990 --> 01:55:14,080
As Expected, Rocchi's "Changing Room" Skit

8422
01:55:10,710 --> 01:55:12,080
His underpants

8423
01:55:14,600 --> 01:55:16,050
I knew it was coming, but...

8424
01:55:16,050 --> 01:55:17,700
I knew it was coming, but...

8425
01:55:16,700 --> 01:55:23,020
Just like Nakaoka's Movements and Voice

8426
01:55:23,370 --> 01:55:26,240
I knew it was coming, but...

8427
01:55:24,510 --> 01:55:26,890
Hmm, yeah

8428
01:55:27,010 --> 01:55:28,510
Have you not put them on yet?

8429
01:55:28,940 --> 01:55:30,580
I still haven't put them on at all

8430
01:55:30,580 --> 01:55:33,100
Oh sorry, It sounded like you had them on

8431
01:55:34,050 --> 01:55:36,550
Once you have them on please let me know

8432
01:55:37,900 --> 01:55:40,240
Yeeeees

8433
01:55:39,250 --> 01:55:40,470
Do you have them on?

8434
01:55:40,390 --> 01:55:40,970
Mmhmm

8435
01:55:40,970 --> 01:55:42,220
I'm opening it, okay?

8436
01:55:41,960 --> 01:55:42,220
Okay

8437
01:55:55,320 --> 01:55:56,270
Pisses me off

8438
01:55:56,250 --> 01:55:57,410
What the hell

8439
01:55:56,920 --> 01:56:00,220
We know it's coming, and yet...

8440
01:56:02,680 --> 01:56:04,450
I know it's coming, and yet...

8441
01:56:04,800 --> 01:56:06,030
Ow, ow, ow, ow, ow

8442
01:56:06,180 --> 01:56:10,350
What a difficult person

8443
01:56:07,380 --> 01:56:08,170
He is, right?

8444
01:56:08,180 --> 01:56:10,050
We shouldn't get him angry

8445
01:56:10,350 --> 01:56:15,670
I just want to share with all of you guys

8446
01:56:12,760 --> 01:56:15,690
The fun of the casino!!

8447
01:56:19,140 --> 01:56:22,010
What are you looking at??

8448
01:56:24,870 --> 01:56:28,990
Seiji Rokkaku

8449
01:56:24,870 --> 01:56:29,000
Casino Customer

8450
01:56:25,480 --> 01:56:28,400
I had no idea he was there

8451
01:56:31,440 --> 01:56:34,140
I didn't think anyone was there

8452
01:56:32,960 --> 01:56:34,960
No way!

8453
01:56:39,520 --> 01:56:41,500
He is looking

8454
01:56:39,520 --> 01:56:43,020
True, he is looking

8455
01:56:40,570 --> 01:56:42,650
No, I'm not looking

8456
01:56:43,990 --> 01:56:46,150
I was looking that way, but

8457
01:56:45,020 --> 01:56:46,150
I wasn't looking at your underpants

8458
01:56:46,520 --> 01:56:50,290
Why are you staring at my underpants!!

8459
01:56:47,960 --> 01:56:50,290
I said I'm not looking at them

8460
01:56:50,290 --> 01:56:53,660
This is a place for gentlemen, could you not look at my underpants?

8461
01:56:50,290 --> 01:56:55,680
No One is Forgiven for Looking at His Underpants

8462
01:56:53,660 --> 01:56:55,700
You dumbass, and you don't have any money...

8463
01:56:55,960 --> 01:56:56,730

You've gambled away so much

8478
01:57:00,450 --> 01:57:04,970
You could buy a small house with your losses!!

8479
01:57:04,970 --> 01:57:06,660
At this point, you've already

8480
01:57:06,690 --> 01:57:10,880
Been divorced three times

8481
01:57:07,660 --> 01:57:10,880

What a mess

8540
01:57:29,130 --> 01:57:36,050
Removing the Unruly Customer

8541
01:57:33,130 --> 01:57:35,900
You have to pull to open. You can't push them

8542
01:57:35,890 --> 01:57:37,570
Wait, wait, wait...

8543
01:57:38,870 --> 01:57:41,040
He's laughing

8544
01:57:41,040 --> 01:57:44,750
Didn't you guys rehearse?

8545
01:57:45,610 --> 01:57:47,320
Did they think they could open them by pushing?

8546
01:57:48,730 --> 01:57:50,730
How awful

8547
01:57:58,390 --> 01:57:59,360
Please excuse me

8548
01:57:59,360 --> 01:58:03,870
For having caused such a scene

8549
01:58:00,610 --> 01:58:03,870
I'm extremely sowree@#*%!$...

8550
01:58:03,870 --> 01:58:07,740
I'm extremely sorry

8551
01:58:09,690 --> 01:58:11,450
What was that, Shingo?

8552
01:58:09,690 --> 01:58:11,990
It became all mumbly

8553
01:58:16,760 --> 01:58:22,370
5 People vs The Legendary Dealer

8554
01:58:16,760 --> 01:58:22,380
Card Game Showdown

8555
01:58:17,350 --> 01:58:19,350
Back to the matter at hand, now

8556
01:58:19,810 --> 01:58:22,230
A card game showdown

8557
01:58:23,020 --> 01:58:33,880

They will be dealt 2 Cards each. If they add up

8560
01:58:23,170 --> 01:58:25,220
The rules are simple

8561
01:58:33,900 --> 01:58:34,730
Go ahead

8562
01:58:35,030 --> 01:58:42,200

Okay, then. Please place your bets

8566
01:58:44,760 --> 01:58:49,080
Players bet if they are confident in their cards

8567
01:58:54,780 --> 01:58:55,980
Both of you are quite confident

8568
01:58:56,770 --> 01:58:57,440
Yeah

8569
01:58:57,750 --> 01:58:58,790

01:59:04,590 --> 01:59:06,590
Wow, look at that!

8579
01:59:05,140 --> 01:59:06,860
Oh, wow

8580
01:59:07,630 --> 01:59:08,560

8581
01:59:11,100 --> 01:59:11,870

Twenty

8583
01:59:12,700 --> 01:59:14,690
With 22, Hosei wins!

8584
01:59:14,490 --> 01:59:17,220

And so, they continue to round two

8590
01:59:31,740 --> 01:59:32,790
Go ahead

8591
01:59:38,910 --> 01:59:39,930
Okay, please place your bets

8592
01:59:40,810 --> 01:59:42,600
I dunno about this one

8593
01:59:41,400 --> 01:59:46,700
Players bet if they are confident in their cards

8594
01:59:44,480 --> 01:59:46,480
Wow, no way

8595
01:59:47,700 --> 01:59:47,890

He went for it

8604
01:59:50,690 --> 01:59:51,470
Are we ready?

8605
01:59:51,960 --> 01:59:52,420
Yes

8606
01:59:52,840 --> 01:59:53,310

That's amazing, you had a king

8624
02:00:16,390 --> 02:00:19,610
For being in first place, we have a prize just for you!

8625
02:00:16,780 --> 02:00:22,720
A reward for Hosei's two consecutive wins

8626
02:00:19,590 --> 02:00:20,190
Eh, for real?

8627
02:00:20,690 --> 02:00:21,380
COME ON!!

8628
02:00:25,730 --> 02:00:31,060
Beautiful foreign ladies have appeared

8629
02:00:33,540 --> 02:00:34,230
A blessed dance by the beautiful women

8630
02:00:33,540 --> 02:00:39,340
A blessed dance by the beautiful women

8631
02:00:33,540 --> 02:00:39,340
A blessed dance by the beautiful women

8632
02:00:46,290 --> 02:00:52,390
The reward is a kiss from a beautiful lady

02:01:04,450 --> 02:01:06,790
Yama-chan you look more pleased than I thought you'd be

8634
02:01:13,600 --> 02:01:15,010
Splendid!

8635
02:01:15,770 --> 02:01:16,880
It wasn't money huh

8636
02:01:16,610 --> 02:01:18,340
That was your reward just now!

8637
02:01:19,740 --> 02:01:20,840
How was it?

8638
02:01:21,650 --> 02:01:24,760
I thought I would get some Heipo chips

8639
02:01:24,170 --> 02:01:25,410
Since he won that much

8640
02:01:25,250 --> 02:01:26,450
If you win, it's heaven

8641
02:01:26,740 --> 02:01:29,930
If you lose, it's hell... This is gambl-

8642
02:01:30,420 --> 02:01:30,460

02:01:35,900 --> 02:01:39,470
For some reason, the hexagon came back

8650
02:01:36,310 --> 02:01:37,970
I wasn't looking at you

8651
02:01:39,890 --> 02:01:41,000
I wasn't looking

8652
02:01:41,000 --> 02:01:41,530
You were looking at my underwear

8653
02:01:41,530 --> 02:01:41,650
You were looking at my underwear

8654
02:01:41,650 --> 02:01:41,720
You were looking at my underwear

8655
02:01:41,720 --> 02:01:41,730
You were looking at my underwear

8656
02:01:41,730 --> 02:01:44,800
You were looking at my underwear

8657
02:01:42,390 --> 02:01:43,500
No no no

8658
02:01:43,860 --> 02:01:45,520
I told you I wasn't looking!

8659
02:01:45,170 --> 02:01:46,340
And what's with that get-up?

8660
02:01:46,370 --> 02:01:47,240
I went to the front desk and asked if they had anything

8661
02:01:47,240 --> 02:01:50,640
I went to the front desk and asked if they had anything

8662
02:01:48,670 --> 02:01:50,640
And they told me this was all they had, it's all your fault

8663
02:01:50,740 --> 02:01:51,950
Hell if I know!

8664
02:01:52,540 --> 02:01:54,290
You were looking at my underwear, weren't you!?

8665
02:01:55,530 --> 02:01:58,120
You keep messing with me you bastard

8666
02:01:58,340 --> 02:01:59,890

8667
02:01:59,520 --> 02:02:01,810

8668
02:02:06,440 --> 02:02:07,510
You bastard!

8669
02:02:08,230 --> 02:02:08,410
You were looking at my underwear just then!

8670
02:02:08,410 --> 02:02:08,510
You were looking at my underwear just then!

8671
02:02:08,510 --> 02:02:08,580

8680
02:02:17,500 --> 02:02:18,940
I wasn't looking at your underwear!

8681
02:02:18,940 --> 02:02:25,110
A mudslinging match of who saw whose underwear

8682
02:02:18,960 --> 02:02:19,830
You bastard!

8683
02:02:20,120 --> 02:02:21,520
You were looking at my underwear!!

8684
02:02:21,520 --> 02:02:22,810
Are you wearing cow underwear!?

8685
02:02:23,220 --> 02:02:24,250
You wearing cow underwear!?

8686
02:02:24,250 --> 02:02:25,310
No it's not cow underwear!!

8687
02:02:25,800 --> 02:02:26,950
Shut up you bastard

8688
02:02:27,040 --> 02:02:27,740
Hey!

8689
02:02:27,820 --> 02:02:28,580
Hey!

8690
02:02:30,990 --> 02:02:32,270
I don't know what the hell is going on

8691
02:02:31,540 --> 02:02:32,740
They're just some old guys...

8692
02:02:33,350 --> 02:02:34,570
What the hell

8693
02:02:35,150 --> 02:02:36,850
What kind of fight was that?

8694
02:02:37,330 --> 02:02:37,860
The usual

8695
02:02:38,850 --> 02:02:39,500
The usual!

8696
02:02:41,190 --> 02:02:42,210
What the hell...

8697
02:02:46,420 --> 02:02:47,390
That fight...

8698
02:02:52,340 --> 02:02:53,670
The legendary dealer...

8699
02:02:55,570 --> 02:02:57,190
You guys saw something great, huh?

8700
02:02:57,020 --> 02:02:57,900
No!?

8701
02:02:58,340 --> 02:02:59,200
C'mon let's go

8702
02:03:01,320 --> 02:03:02,850
Seems like there wasn't a reward

8703
02:03:03,140 --> 02:03:04,440
Due this incident, later on

8704
02:03:04,440 --> 02:03:11,990
An unexpected tragedy will arise

8705
02:03:04,440 --> 02:03:11,990
An unexpected tragedy will arise

8706
02:03:12,990 --> 02:03:17,700
10 hours past

8707
02:03:14,990 --> 02:03:17,700
The group heads back to the casino again

8708
02:03:19,640 --> 02:03:21,310
The reason is...

8709
02:03:20,820 --> 02:03:21,470
What?

8710
02:03:22,330 --> 02:03:23,470
Everyone all good?

8711
02:03:23,890 --> 02:03:25,230
From now-

8712
02:03:24,000 --> 02:03:25,230
There's no way we're "good," idiot

8713
02:03:25,330 --> 02:03:27,890
You have a chance to make a killing at the casino

8714
02:03:28,290 --> 02:03:29,090
I see

8715
02:03:28,980 --> 02:03:29,300
Oh

8716
02:03:29,300 --> 02:03:29,900
Ah

8717
02:03:29,570 --> 02:03:30,770
We haven't really gotten anything...

8718
02:03:30,050 --> 02:03:32,530
You keep saying that over and over and we keep coming back

8719
02:03:31,610 --> 02:03:32,400
Uh huh

8720
02:03:32,920 --> 02:03:34,080
We haven't done anything

8721
02:03:34,080 --> 02:03:36,820
It's okay to laugh from here on out

If we head inside it's okay to laugh?

8725
02:03:39,540 --> 02:03:41,260

Why would you say that our faces alone aren't enough?

8779
02:05:11,210 --> 02:05:15,250

T/N: Fumino Kimura is a famous Japanese actress that has appeared in several movies and shows.

8786
02:05:22,730 --> 02:05:23,720
Someone youthful

8787
02:05:25,930 --> 02:05:27,090
I see

8788
02:05:27,610 --> 02:05:29,740
Nice to meet you

8789
02:05:30,020 --> 02:05:31,090
Surely

8790
02:05:31,130 --> 02:05:34,430
She's got about three times the youth

8791
02:05:34,430 --> 02:05:36,100
Youth and beauty!

8792
02:05:37,040 --> 02:05:38,970
So you're a big fan of the No Laughing Series?

8793
02:05:39,100 --> 02:05:43,840
Yes

8794
02:05:40,440 --> 02:05:43,840
You don't feel that way at all right?

8795
02:05:43,110 --> 02:05:43,730
No no no

8796
02:05:43,840 --> 02:05:45,970
Oh you like the series? Then which part do you like huh?

8797
02:05:46,510 --> 02:05:51,750
When someone doesn't actually think that,

8798
02:05:47,480 --> 02:05:51,750
They cut off the conversation with a "yes"

8799
02:05:50,230 --> 02:05:51,250
Yeah that does happen!

8800
02:05:51,250 --> 02:05:51,810
Right

8801
02:05:51,810 --> 02:05:52,940
Up until now,

8802
02:05:53,180 --> 02:05:55,190
What left an impression on you?

8803
02:05:55,190 --> 02:05:59,560
Recently there have been a lot of actors that have appeared

8804
02:05:58,670 --> 02:05:59,410
True true

8805
02:05:59,990 --> 02:06:01,800
When the actors appear,

8806
02:06:01,860 --> 02:06:08,030
It's different from the usual faces I see

8807
02:06:05,230 --> 02:06:08,030
So I like that

8808
02:06:08,030 --> 02:06:08,770

02:06:08,770 --> 02:06:09,400

8810
02:06:09,400 --> 02:06:12,810

8811
02:06:11,270 --> 02:06:12,290
You said that so bluntly!

8812
02:06:12,550 --> 02:06:13,360
Ah really?

8813
02:06:13,030 --> 02:06:15,620
It's because you watched various things you could point that out

8814
02:06:13,270 --> 02:06:14,500
So bluntly

8815
02:06:17,020 --> 02:06:18,090

Those are some good expressions

8845

02:11:31,760 --> 02:11:34,160
Thank you very much!

9014
02:11:36,130 --> 02:11:38,800
Not ONE of those jokes landed

9015
02:11:38,800 --> 02:11:40,830
Because of your beads!!

9016
02:11:38,800 --> 02:11:40,830
T/N: He's referring the the Buddhist prayer bead bracelets.

9017
02:11:41,050 --> 02:11:42,830
That had nothing to do with it

9018
02:11:43,470 --> 02:11:47,340
They look like a wallet chain that hangs

9019
02:11:44,800 --> 02:11:47,340
From your back pocket

9020
02:11:46,370 --> 02:11:47,460
He wore them

9021
02:11:48,140 --> 02:11:49,340
Not like him

9022
02:11:48,740 --> 02:11:49,070
I really hate thwose!!

9023
02:11:49,070 --> 02:11:50,910
I really hate thwose!!

9024
02:11:50,970 --> 02:11:52,200
Nailed it

9025
02:11:52,370 --> 02:11:53,650
"Hate thwose??"

9026
02:11:52,740 --> 02:11:55,510
What the hell is "thwose"!?

9027
02:11:55,510 --> 02:11:58,480
We were so nervous

9028
02:11:58,800 --> 02:12:02,720
Chidori

9029
02:12:02,720 --> 02:12:05,490
Bus Joke Compilation

9030

9033
02:12:05,840 --> 02:12:06,460
Hello?

9034
02:12:06,760 --> 02:12:11,660
Breach of manners: Talking on the bus

9035
02:12:08,520 --> 02:12:09,190
What?

9036
02:12:09,400 --> 02:12:10,900
Are you an idiot?

9037
02:12:12,000 --> 02:12:14,160
Hey hey,  that's awful of you

9038
02:12:13,160 --> 02:12:14,170
Hey hey, that's awful of you

9039
02:12:14,170 --> 02:12:16,870
Talking on the phone in a bus!!

9040
02:12:14,190 --> 02:12:16,180
Stop that

9041
02:12:16,870 --> 02:12:21,310
From the back,
a middle-aged salaryman appears...

9042
02:12:18,470 --> 02:12:19,290
That's not cool

9043
02:12:20,870 --> 02:12:22,930
Seriously?

9044
02:12:21,640 --> 02:12:26,550
At the time, known as a victim of street violence

9045
02:12:21,640 --> 02:12:26,550
Shinya Owada

9046
02:12:21,640 --> 02:12:26,550
T/N: Shinya Owada is a famous actor, voice actor, and narrator.

9047
02:12:23,270 --> 02:12:24,670
I already told you to be quiet

9048
02:12:26,550 --> 02:12:28,550
Say it louder

9049
02:12:31,250 --> 02:12:32,320
Oh Akira!

9050
02:12:32,320 --> 02:12:33,620
Takeshi!

9051
02:12:33,620 --> 02:12:36,320
Somehow I've been caught up

9052
02:12:34,520 --> 02:12:36,320
With some weird geezer

9053
02:12:36,320 --> 02:12:42,290
Owada gets caught up
with a delinquent for warning about manners

9054
02:12:37,350 --> 02:12:39,830
Oi, old man! What business you got wit Akira?

9055
02:12:42,460 --> 02:12:43,440
In a train, using a phone... I mean a bus

9056
02:12:43,440 --> 02:12:45,160
In a train, using a phone... I mean a bus

9057
02:12:45,160 --> 02:12:46,030
In a train, using a phone... I mean a bus

9058
02:12:46,430 --> 02:12:48,950
I'm saying that you can't use a phone

9059
02:12:49,210 --> 02:12:49,830
Shut up old man

9060
02:12:49,830 --> 02:12:52,170
Shut up with your damn blabbering!!

9061
02:12:52,440 --> 02:12:53,210

02:12:53,540 --> 02:12:54,310
Come on old man!!

9063
02:12:54,170 --> 02:12:55,840
We were just discussing it

9064
02:12:55,840 --> 02:12:56,640
Discussing!?

9065
02:12:56,830 --> 02:12:58,240
I told you, just discussing!

9066
02:12:58,690 --> 02:12:59,710
What the hell is up with you!?

9067
02:12:59,980 --> 02:13:00,690
Let's stop this

9068
02:13:00,850 --> 02:13:02,320
Shut it stupid!!

9069
02:13:02,840 --> 02:13:04,070
I said shut up!!

9070
02:13:04,950 --> 02:13:05,950
You wanna have a go at it, huh?

9071
02:13:05,670 --> 02:13:06,700
Yeah, let's go

9072
02:13:06,470 --> 02:13:07,410
Let's go

9073
02:13:07,520 --> 02:13:09,120
Then... Follow me!!

9074
02:13:09,120 --> 02:13:10,020
Then... Follow me!!

9075
02:13:10,020 --> 02:13:12,220
Owada escapes!!

9076
02:13:11,200 --> 02:13:11,890
OUCH!!

9077
02:13:11,410 --> 02:13:12,500
Oh, ouch, ouch

9078
02:13:13,130 --> 02:13:14,830
Ow, ow, ow

9079
02:13:15,170 --> 02:13:16,150
He got got

9080
02:13:18,560 --> 02:13:20,100
Twisted his foot

9081
02:13:19,300 --> 02:13:20,530
His leg went limp!

9082
02:13:20,530 --> 02:13:21,170
It did! It did!

9083
02:13:21,170 --> 02:13:22,830
His leg went limp didn't it

9084
02:13:22,780 --> 02:13:24,270
That was scary

9085
02:13:23,470 --> 02:13:25,070
Then... Follow me!!

9086
02:13:25,070 --> 02:13:25,900
Then... Follow me!!

9087
02:13:27,050 --> 02:13:27,710
OUCH!!

9088
02:13:28,940 --> 02:13:29,740
Then... Follow me!!

9089
02:13:30,970 --> 02:13:31,580
OUCH!!

9090
02:13:32,710 --> 02:13:37,920
Owada Shinya

9091
02:13:38,080 --> 02:13:45,690
Out of the five, who got the most laughs?

9092
02:13:45,690 --> 02:13:56,370
Rules

9093
02:13:45,910 --> 02:13:56,370
Calculation is: times butts were hit = points

9094
02:13:45,910 --> 02:13:56,370
If all 5 hit at once: 5 points

9095
02:13:45,910 --> 02:13:56,370
m 346.5 786 l 1798.5 786 1798.5 999 346.5 999

9096
02:13:50,230 --> 02:13:50,860
Right

9097
02:13:50,230 --> 02:13:50,860
Right

9098
02:13:50,860 --> 02:13:52,760
If one was hit that's one time

9099
02:13:52,760 --> 02:13:54,760
Got it

9100
02:13:53,010 --> 02:13:54,660
If all 5 were hit that's 5 times

9101
02:13:56,740 --> 02:13:58,440
When Daichi was on, Hosei was really into it

9102
02:13:58,170 --> 02:15:02,170
Chidori

9103
02:13:58,170 --> 02:15:02,170
Mao
Daichi

9104
02:13:58,170 --> 02:15:02,170
Owada
Shinya

9105
02:13:58,170 --> 02:15:02,170
Tsuyoshi
Kusanagi

9106
02:13:58,170 --> 02:15:02,170
Umemiya
Tatsuo

9107
02:13:58,440 --> 02:13:59,770
When Daichi was on, Hosei was really into it

9108
02:13:59,770 --> 02:14:03,010
When Daichi was on, Hosei was really into it

9109
02:14:01,370 --> 02:14:02,760
I was, really

9110
02:14:02,380 --> 02:14:02,760
Yeah

9111
02:14:03,010 --> 02:14:04,550
I think she did well with

9112
02:14:04,550 --> 02:14:06,550
Just Yamasaki then

9113
02:14:07,050 --> 02:14:08,310
She earned her income just from Hosei

9114
02:14:08,310 --> 02:14:11,480
Basically, I like funny faces

9115
02:14:10,150 --> 02:14:11,310
Got it

9116
02:14:11,940 --> 02:14:13,250
It was blow after blow

9117
02:14:13,290 --> 02:14:15,290
It was Daichi's funny faces so I couldn't resist

9118
02:14:14,930 --> 02:14:16,500
That's irresistable

9119
02:14:15,290 --> 02:14:16,860
It was Daichi's funny faces so I couldn't resist

9120
02:14:16,860 --> 02:14:19,150
And Hamada, Umemiya's one

9121
02:14:19,150 --> 02:14:19,550
Right

9122
02:14:19,850 --> 02:14:20,610
That was a shock

9123
02:14:20,650 --> 02:14:21,500
Well, yeah, on that

9124
02:14:21,020 --> 02:14:21,900
Yeah it was

9125
02:14:21,790 --> 02:14:23,500
Koyabu was great

9126
02:14:23,110 --> 02:14:24,590
In that way

9127
02:14:25,180 --> 02:14:26,990
I'm amazed he actually did it

9128
02:14:27,170 --> 02:14:29,970
He was really talking crap

9129
02:14:29,970 --> 02:14:31,370
"Your laugh lines are all rolled up"

9130
02:14:31,370 --> 02:14:36,170
"Your laugh lines are all rolled up"

9131
02:14:33,630 --> 02:14:34,550
From this side

9132
02:14:35,030 --> 02:14:36,950
Never heard that expression before

9133
02:14:36,370 --> 02:14:38,340
Ridiculous

9134
02:14:38,340 --> 02:14:39,810
When Chidori was on we didn't laugh that much

9135
02:14:39,810 --> 02:14:43,080
When Chidori was on we didn't laugh that much

9136
02:14:43,080 --> 02:14:44,830
We could see that you were really nervous

9137
02:14:44,630 --> 02:14:45,320
That's understandable

9138
02:14:45,850 --> 02:14:50,260
It's because there's a certain structure to these things

9139
02:14:50,260 --> 02:14:55,030
There's a nature to the work

9140
02:14:51,150 --> 02:14:52,660
Yes, the work

9141
02:14:52,660 --> 02:14:53,870
You don't have to follow

9142
02:14:53,870 --> 02:14:56,050
The rhythm of our jokes isn't just bam, bam

9143
02:14:56,050 --> 02:14:58,050
We make you laugh with a pop and then bang

9144
02:14:57,720 --> 02:14:59,650
That's our aim

9145
02:14:59,650 --> 02:15:01,650
At any rate Chidori is in the list

9146
02:15:02,170 --> 02:15:04,760
By the way I have a follow-up story

9147
02:15:06,060 --> 02:15:08,160
From Shinya Owada

9148
02:15:08,410 --> 02:15:21,590
Shinya Owada's Follow-up

9149
02:15:08,410 --> 02:15:21,590
m 589.5 705 l 1143 705 1143 783 589.5 783

9150
02:15:08,410 --> 02:15:21,590
m 589.5 796.5 l 1837.5 796.5 1837.5 1012.5 589.5 1012.5

9151
02:15:08,860 --> 02:15:21,590
Directors at drama shoots

9152
02:15:11,640 --> 02:15:21,590
Always tease me with,

9153
02:15:16,110 --> 02:15:21,590
"That was your funniest work, Shinya."

9154
02:15:18,670 --> 02:15:20,890
It made that strong of an impact

9155
02:15:21,590 --> 02:15:22,990
These are the members

9156
02:15:23,390 --> 02:15:24,770
Please bet, go ahead!

9157
02:15:25,440 --> 02:15:27,830
Who made them laugh the most?

9158
02:15:25,440 --> 02:15:27,830
Who made them laugh the most?

9159
02:15:27,830 --> 02:15:28,950
Here it is

9160
02:15:27,830 --> 02:17:09,060
Chidori

9161
02:15:27,830 --> 02:17:09,060
Mao
Daichi

9162
02:15:27,830 --> 02:17:09,060
Owada
Shinya

9163
02:15:27,830 --> 02:17:09,060
Tsuyoshi
Kusanagi

9164
02:15:27,830 --> 02:17:09,060
Umemiya
Tatsuo

9165
02:15:29,780 --> 02:15:31,780
Here we go

9166
02:15:31,830 --> 02:15:33,830
Kimura, you're on number 1, Kusanagi

9167
02:15:33,880 --> 02:15:35,390
Number 1, yes

9168
02:15:35,400 --> 02:15:37,250
50,000 Heipo chips. Why him?

9169
02:15:36,320 --> 02:15:36,700
Yes

9170
02:15:37,250 --> 02:15:41,010
When I watched, I really liked Kusanagi's turn

9171
02:15:41,010 --> 02:15:44,680
So I worked up the courage and put down 50,000 Heipo

9172
02:15:44,160 --> 02:15:45,630
So you bet that much more

9173
02:15:44,680 --> 02:15:46,310
I worked up the courage

9174
02:15:47,710 --> 02:15:52,010
And Matsumoto you put down a lot, 100,000 Heipo

9175
02:15:52,010 --> 02:15:56,230
Well, it's the first round so I thought I'd go for it

9176
02:15:56,320 --> 02:15:59,690
And there was the shock of Kusanagi appearing

9177
02:15:59,460 --> 02:16:00,840
That's right

9178
02:16:00,840 --> 02:16:02,560
Owada's was

9179
02:16:02,590 --> 02:16:07,930
After he left the bus, so...

9180
02:16:05,710 --> 02:16:07,710
That was a big laugh

9181
02:16:07,810 --> 02:16:09,600
Hamada, you also went with Kusanagi

9182
02:16:09,600 --> 02:16:12,330
It was either him or Daichi

9183
02:16:12,340 --> 02:16:16,910
Three and up are nothing

9184
02:16:14,820 --> 02:16:16,190
Only 2 real choices

9185
02:16:16,190 --> 02:16:17,840
There are only 2 real choices but

9186
02:16:18,510 --> 02:16:23,030
If I went with Daichi, it's not so good,
but Kusanagi's more recent

9187
02:16:24,360 --> 02:16:27,020
He had more impact like he just said

9188
02:16:29,100 --> 02:16:30,120
How about Hosei?

9189
02:16:29,100 --> 02:16:30,890
What a bet!

9190
02:16:30,650 --> 02:16:32,040
That's a huge bet! 200,000 Heipo

9191
02:16:32,260 --> 02:16:35,590
I have a ton of confidence

9192
02:16:34,510 --> 02:16:35,230
Because you laughed a lot?

9193
02:16:35,480 --> 02:16:39,000
Yeah, I laughed a ton,
And it was really dense

9194
02:16:39,000 --> 02:16:44,690
Daichi's time was the shortest,
But in that time it was going super fast

9195
02:16:44,690 --> 02:16:45,950
That makes sense

9196
02:16:45,520 --> 02:16:47,040
The amount is amazing

9197
02:16:47,100 --> 02:16:47,740
Definitely

9198
02:16:48,310 --> 02:16:49,570
Endo, you also went with Kusanagi

9199
02:16:49,120 --> 02:16:51,380
I did 100,000 Heipo

9200
02:16:49,870 --> 02:16:50,960
Ah, 100,000

9201
02:16:52,240 --> 02:16:56,180
I think we laughed at everything he did

9202
02:16:56,180 --> 02:16:59,220
He was basically perfect

9203
02:16:58,770 --> 02:17:00,400
And Tanaka

9204
02:17:00,480 --> 02:17:01,520
70,000

9205
02:17:01,790 --> 02:17:03,790
For Daichi

9206
02:17:04,500 --> 02:17:07,690
Everyone's focused on 1 and 2

9207
02:17:08,410 --> 02:17:10,310
Here are the results!

9208
02:17:11,300 --> 02:17:13,730
This is a fateful results announcement!

9209
02:17:14,530 --> 02:17:15,450
Starting now!

9210
02:17:15,700 --> 02:17:17,700
We don't need this

9211
02:17:17,590 --> 02:17:18,340
What's up?

9212
02:17:17,800 --> 02:17:18,990
Whether you are correct

9213
02:17:19,470 --> 02:17:20,620
I want to get this over with

9214
02:17:20,620 --> 02:17:24,160
Or out, you will be split between heaven and hell!

9215
02:17:24,840 --> 02:17:29,660
But you don't know that, since you haven't seen the results yet!

9216
02:17:29,660 --> 02:17:30,830
Do it already

9217
02:17:30,960 --> 02:17:31,670
Well then

9218
02:17:32,870 --> 02:17:34,330
The answer is...

9219
02:17:38,070 --> 02:17:39,410
That's how it was huh

9220
02:17:38,490 --> 02:17:39,830
Alright, here we go!

9221
02:17:43,510 --> 02:17:44,510
Go go go

9222
02:17:45,660 --> 02:17:46,460
No way

9223
02:17:46,660 --> 02:17:47,510
Seriously

9224
02:17:50,170 --> 02:17:52,850
Which will it be, Umemiya or Kusanagi? 1 or 3?

9225
02:17:54,420 --> 02:17:55,690
What a difference

9226
02:17:57,660 --> 02:17:59,190
There was that big of a gap?

9227
02:18:00,930 --> 02:18:03,530
The correct answer is number 1, Kusanagi

9228
02:18:05,220 --> 02:18:07,030
Hosei, this hurts doesn't it?

9229
02:18:05,220 --> 02:18:16,960

Didn't you go a little hard?

9242
02:18:07,090 --> 02:18:08,070
Did you see that!?

9243
02:18:08,070 --> 02:18:08,620
That hurts!

9244
02:18:08,620 --> 02:18:10,150
This is serious

9245
02:18:10,430 --> 02:18:11,590
This is bad!

9246
02:18:11,230 --> 02:18:12,870
This is pretty bad

9247
02:18:13,470 --> 02:18:15,710
We now have a large gap

9248
02:18:16,960 --> 02:18:18,960
Let me give an excuse for Chidori's performance

9249
02:18:18,960 --> 02:18:20,470
During manzai we don't stop

9250
02:18:20,470 --> 02:18:23,030
During manzai we don't stop

9251
02:18:23,030 --> 02:18:25,390
Our procedure was to not let the "DUN DUN!" stop the segment

9252
02:18:25,370 --> 02:18:27,280
Even if we laugh

9253
02:18:27,200 --> 02:18:29,200
Because we wanted you to laugh exactly

9254
02:18:29,200 --> 02:18:33,180
When we wunn you to, that's why it's only 10

9255
02:18:31,200 --> 02:18:32,980
"When we wunn you to," okay

9256
02:18:34,510 --> 02:18:36,380
I messed that up, of coursh

9257
02:18:36,380 --> 02:18:37,230
You're messing up a lot today

9258
02:18:38,220 --> 02:18:39,400
Seriously

9259
02:18:41,020 --> 02:18:43,650

Doctor!

9268
02:18:57,450 --> 02:18:59,450
This is the person

9269
02:18:59,940 --> 02:19:01,170
Introduced as the Madonna doctor

9270
02:19:02,470 --> 02:19:06,540

T/N: Hisako Manda is a famous actress. She also competed in the Miss Universe contest in 1978 to represent Japan.

9273
02:19:04,980 --> 02:19:06,710
She was incredible

9274
02:19:09,180 --> 02:19:12,080
This is Hisako speaking

9275
02:19:12,080 --> 02:19:18,460
My manager went and got me a role,

9276
02:19:14,250 --> 02:19:18,460
On a New Year's Eve special program.

9277
02:19:18,460 --> 02:19:27,800
But when I looked at the details,

9278
02:19:20,890 --> 02:19:23,090
It was actually an unbelievably disgraceful job

9279
02:19:22,160 --> 02:19:27,800
It was actually an unbelievably disgraceful job

9280
02:19:24,140 --> 02:19:26,140
It's not a disgraceful job...

9281
02:19:27,800 --> 02:19:30,930
This is Hisako speaking

9282
02:19:30,930 --> 02:19:39,780
Even though it's such a disgraceful job,

9283
02:19:34,940 --> 02:19:36,940
I only get about the same meager pay as Yaku Mitsuru

9284
02:19:36,940 --> 02:19:39,780
I only get about the same meager pay as Yaku Mitsuru

9285
02:19:36,940 --> 02:19:41,910
T/N: Yaku Mitsuru is a manga artist. His mangas aren't mainstream and his art style is more caricature-like. Because of this, he is probably not that successful.

9286
02:19:39,780 --> 02:19:41,910
She's got a lot to say

9287
02:19:41,910 --> 02:19:46,650
Hisako Manda

9288
02:19:42,950 --> 02:19:46,170

Um, I'm Tsukite-

9306

What's your problem!?

02:23:11,430 --> 02:23:14,460
Has anything exciting happened lately?

9383
02:23:14,460 --> 02:23:14,870
No, well, just the usual...

9384
02:23:14,870 --> 02:23:15,830
No, well, just the usual...

9385
02:23:15,830 --> 02:23:18,930

9388
02:23:18,930 --> 02:23:21,600
He sleeps then gets up

He goes to work in his used Volvo

9392
02:23:25,940 --> 02:23:29,070
He gets a low pay

9393
02:23:28,590 --> 02:23:29,410
Secondhand Volvo

9394
02:23:29,080 --> 02:23:29,770
He eats a lunch box

9395
02:23:29,770 --> 02:23:32,280
He eats a lunch box

9396
02:23:32,280 --> 02:23:34,380
He smokes cigarettes

9397
02:23:34,380 --> 02:23:35,380
He comes home, goes to sleep, and wakes up again

9398
02:23:35,380 --> 02:23:37,850

9402
02:23:41,320 --> 02:23:43,790
Again, goes to work in his used Volvo

9403
02:23:45,970 --> 02:23:48,730
WHAT A POINTLESS LIFE!!

9404
02:23:49,590 --> 02:23:51,050
She says such mean things

9405
02:23:50,840 --> 02:23:52,530
You two

9406
02:23:54,270 --> 02:23:55,230
You receive

9407
02:23:55,230 --> 02:23:55,630
You receive a damn big paycheck

9408
02:23:55,630 --> 02:23:57,240
You receive a damn big paycheck

9409
02:23:57,240 --> 02:23:57,840
Complaining that dramas are tiring

9410
02:23:57,840 --> 02:23:59,300
Complaining that dramas are tiring

9411
02:23:59,300 --> 02:24:01,410
Complaining that dramas are tiring

9412
02:24:01,410 --> 02:24:01,940
Or saying my knee hurts

9413
02:24:01,940 --> 02:24:04,410
Or saying my knee hurts

9414
02:24:05,770 --> 02:24:05,940
Who do you think you are!

9415
02:24:05,940 --> 02:24:07,750
Who do you think you are!

9416
02:24:15,510 --> 02:24:17,720
You sure are ugly, huh

9417
02:24:18,960 --> 02:24:19,720
That timing

9418
02:24:19,470 --> 02:24:22,690
YOU

9419
02:24:19,860 --> 02:24:19,970
DAMN PIG!!

9420
02:24:19,970 --> 02:24:20,060
DAMN PIG!!

9421
02:24:20,060 --> 02:24:22,690
DAMN PIG!!

9422
02:24:21,190 --> 02:24:22,990
She really lays it on

9423
02:24:26,250 --> 02:24:28,030
Then, I'll show you

9424
02:24:28,040 --> 02:24:32,700
Using her body to show must-do's for every CA

9425
02:24:28,870 --> 02:24:30,230
Keep your eyes open

9426
02:24:30,230 --> 02:24:32,650
I remember this, this was really somehitng

9427
02:24:36,580 --> 02:24:37,540
Are you serious?

9428
02:24:37,990 --> 02:24:39,750
Teacher, it's okay

9429
02:24:39,750 --> 02:24:42,610
T/N: "The Inugami Family" is a movie from 1976 with a remake in 2006.

9430

9431
02:24:39,840 --> 02:24:39,960
INUGAMI FAMILY!!

9432
02:24:39,940 --> 02:24:42,610
INUGAMI FAMILY!!

9433
02:24:42,890 --> 02:24:44,980
She couldn't do it at all

9434
02:24:44,980 --> 02:24:46,050
Wait, wait

9435
02:24:46,370 --> 02:24:47,910
Teacher

9436
02:24:46,370 --> 02:24:47,910
Teacher

9437
02:24:46,370 --> 02:24:47,910
Teacher

9438
02:24:48,030 --> 02:24:53,220
Takahashi Keiko

9439
02:24:49,970 --> 02:24:53,220
Wow, this is really hard

9440
02:24:53,370 --> 02:24:59,900
Who of the four made them laugh the most?

9441
02:24:59,900 --> 02:25:03,210
So, we have our four entries

9442
02:24:59,900 --> 02:25:22,890
Hisako
Manda

9443
02:24:59,900 --> 02:25:22,890
Takahashi
Keiko

9444
02:24:59,900 --> 02:25:22,890
Takenaka
Naoto

9445
02:24:59,900 --> 02:25:22,890
Yuuki
Amami

9446
02:25:04,110 --> 02:25:05,240
Takenaka's raging waves tactic was incredible

9447
02:25:05,240 --> 02:25:11,340
Takenaka's raging waves tactic was incredible

9448
02:25:09,350 --> 02:25:10,610
Definitely

9449
02:25:10,610 --> 02:25:12,610
His numbers were, too

9450
02:25:11,350 --> 02:25:12,870
Yeah, they were

9451
02:25:12,870 --> 02:25:14,870
He was crazy

9452
02:25:14,870 --> 02:25:16,020
Exactly

9453
02:25:17,210 --> 02:25:19,050
This is hard

9454
02:25:18,370 --> 02:25:19,410
Yes it is

9455
02:25:19,050 --> 02:25:20,170
Yeah it is

9456
02:25:20,170 --> 02:25:22,710
We now have a follow-up story from Manda

9457
02:25:22,890 --> 02:25:43,670
Follow-up from Hisako Manda

9458
02:25:22,890 --> 02:25:43,670
m 585 696 l 1368 696 1368 792 585 792

9459
02:25:22,890 --> 02:25:43,670
m 589.5 798 l 1837.5 798 1837.5 1012.5 589.5 1012.5

9460
02:25:23,520 --> 02:25:34,400
The reaction I got after appearing

9461
02:25:26,270 --> 02:25:34,400
Was on a level I hadn't gotten since I was chosen

9462
02:25:29,310 --> 02:25:34,400
To be Miss Universe Japan.

9463
02:25:30,890 --> 02:25:33,870
Really, that far back?

9464
02:25:31,510 --> 02:25:33,910
That's amazing

9465
02:25:34,480 --> 02:25:43,670
At New Year's parties since then,

9466
02:25:36,630 --> 02:25:43,670
I always get requests,

9467
02:25:38,380 --> 02:25:43,670
"Please do the Hiroshi act for us!"

9468
02:25:40,400 --> 02:25:43,050
That sounds about right

9469
02:25:43,670 --> 02:25:52,180
Hisako
Manda

9470
02:25:43,670 --> 02:25:52,180
Takahashi
Keiko

9471
02:25:43,670 --> 02:25:52,180
Takenaka
Naoto

9472
02:25:43,670 --> 02:25:52,180
Yuuki
Amami

9473
02:25:43,680 --> 02:25:46,290
Kimura, do you have a particular one that sticks in your memory?

9474
02:25:46,750 --> 02:25:48,450
Amami being the commanding lead is what I like

9475
02:25:48,450 --> 02:25:52,180
Amami being the commanding lead is what I like

9476
02:25:52,180 --> 02:25:54,190
The Samba Rhythm that the two does after that part

9477
02:25:52,180 --> 02:25:57,520
T/N: Endo and Hosei end up doing the Samba Rhythm Ho-Ho-Hoi dance after the clip they showed of Amami.

9478
02:25:54,190 --> 02:25:57,520
The Samba Rhythm that the two does after that part

9479
02:25:55,510 --> 02:25:57,950
Rhythm

9480
02:25:57,520 --> 02:26:00,320
I love that part

9481
02:25:58,990 --> 02:26:00,310
Of course

9482
02:26:00,320 --> 02:26:03,590
Do you know what we do besides Samba Rhythm?

9483
02:26:04,040 --> 02:26:07,330
What do we do besides Samba Rhythm

9484
02:26:05,330 --> 02:26:06,110
There was another

9485
02:26:07,340 --> 02:26:10,130
You do Samba Rhythm with Endo right

9486
02:26:10,140 --> 02:26:12,790
Endo does Samba Rhythm, and Yamasaki does something else

9487
02:26:10,290 --> 02:26:11,790
I do Samba Rhythm

9488
02:26:10,790 --> 02:26:12,110
He does that

9489
02:26:12,790 --> 02:26:15,460
Ho-ho-hoi, right? Is that also Samba Rhythm?

9490
02:26:15,470 --> 02:26:17,460
Endo does that, right

9491
02:26:15,470 --> 02:26:17,460
That's Endo

9492
02:26:15,470 --> 02:26:17,460
That's Endo

9493
02:26:17,460 --> 02:26:18,490
And then Hosei does...

9494
02:26:18,490 --> 02:26:19,440
Then, one more

9495
02:26:19,440 --> 02:26:20,050
I think that is common knowledge

9496
02:26:20,050 --> 02:26:24,580
I think that is common knowledge

9497
02:26:22,810 --> 02:26:24,580
How sad!

9498
02:26:22,810 --> 02:26:24,580
No one remembers

9499
02:26:24,580 --> 02:26:31,650
Hosei's gag "Maa" was also performed

9500
02:26:25,730 --> 02:26:29,370
No one remembers this common knowledge

9501
02:26:29,370 --> 02:26:30,770
It's fine, totally fine

9502
02:26:30,770 --> 02:26:31,510
Because it's his gag right?

9503
02:26:31,660 --> 02:26:33,660
The gag "Maa"

9504
02:26:33,660 --> 02:26:37,760
Maa?

9505
02:26:34,970 --> 02:26:37,760
She doesn't remember it at all

9506
02:26:37,760 --> 02:26:38,410
Maa!?

9507
02:26:38,410 --> 02:26:39,610
You reacted like you've never heard of it

9508
02:26:41,070 --> 02:26:43,400
Nice parroting

9509
02:26:43,400 --> 02:26:46,490
We have a follow-up from Amami as well

9510
02:26:46,700 --> 02:27:04,060
m 589.5 798 l 1837.5 798 1837.5 1012.5 589.5 1012.5

9511
02:26:46,710 --> 02:27:04,060
Follow-up from Yuuki Amami

9512
02:26:46,710 --> 02:27:04,060
m 585 696 l 1368 696 1368 792 585 792

9513
02:26:46,800 --> 02:26:54,310
After appearing, I got praise

9514
02:26:49,940 --> 02:26:54,310
From Tomokazu Miura, who said

9515
02:26:52,760 --> 02:26:54,310
"Your part was the funniest."

9516
02:26:54,390 --> 02:27:04,060
I pretty much got a feel for doing it

9517
02:26:56,860 --> 02:27:04,060
So while I still have it,

9518
02:26:58,620 --> 02:27:04,060
Please let me have another go.

9519
02:26:59,720 --> 02:27:01,630
Why the hell?

9520
02:27:01,630 --> 02:27:02,850
"The feel for it"

9521
02:27:03,390 --> 02:27:04,390
By the way recently,

9522
02:27:04,390 --> 02:27:14,530
On another program Eiko Koike asked Amami

9523
02:27:05,970 --> 02:27:07,210
That happened

9524
02:27:06,860 --> 02:27:08,070
About the color of her nipples and she got really pissed

9525
02:27:08,070 --> 02:27:14,530
About the color of her nipples and she got really pissed

9526
02:27:11,130 --> 02:27:12,830
That would piss anyone off

9527
02:27:12,830 --> 02:27:14,330
There are some things you don't ask

9528
02:27:14,540 --> 02:27:17,570
I asked Koike about it, she said, Amami didn't reply to her for a while

9529
02:27:16,730 --> 02:27:17,570
She really was pissed

9530
02:27:18,110 --> 02:27:19,350
Sounds like she was pissed

9531
02:27:19,510 --> 02:27:20,570
That'll happen

9532
02:27:20,570 --> 02:27:25,190
All right everyone, who got the most laughs? Go ahead and bet for their number please

9533
02:27:25,580 --> 02:27:28,790
Who made them laugh the most?

9534
02:27:26,090 --> 02:27:27,430
I think this is gonna be hard

9535
02:27:27,430 --> 02:27:29,090
Feeling unsure about this

9536
02:27:27,430 --> 02:27:29,090
This is hard

9537
02:27:29,090 --> 02:27:30,610
This is hard

9538
02:27:30,610 --> 02:27:32,610
There's gonna be a split here

9539
02:27:33,220 --> 02:28:15,490
Hisako

9540
02:27:33,220 --> 02:28:15,490

Yuuki
Amami

9543
02:27:33,250 --> 02:27:36,550
Matsumoto bets 100,000 Heipo on Takenaka

9544
02:27:36,960 --> 02:27:40,150
Hamada bets 100,000 Heipo on Amami, right

9545
02:27:38,970 --> 02:27:39,690
Yes!

9546
02:27:40,310 --> 02:27:43,550
Hosei also bets on Amami for 50,000 Heipo, right

9547
02:27:42,850 --> 02:27:43,470
Yes!

9548
02:27:43,570 --> 02:27:47,850
Endo bets on Takenaka, 50,000 Heipo, right

9549
02:27:46,930 --> 02:27:47,590
Yes!

9550
02:27:48,030 --> 02:27:49,850
Tanaka bets on Takenaka...

9551
02:27:49,850 --> 02:27:50,930
60,000 Heipo

9552
02:27:50,930 --> 02:27:53,770
Really cutting it fine there

9553
02:27:52,710 --> 02:27:56,240
You gotta go for it more!!

9554
02:27:56,240 --> 02:27:57,010
Your betting style is like a used Volvo

9555
02:27:57,010 --> 02:28:00,880
Your betting style is like a used Volvo

9556
02:27:57,830 --> 02:28:00,880
Shut it! Hey! Hey! That's rude

9557
02:28:00,880 --> 02:28:02,880
New ones go for 10 years right?

9558
02:28:03,870 --> 02:28:05,450
I'm betting 60,000 Heipo

9559
02:28:06,130 --> 02:28:08,630
Oh, Kimura, are you confident?

9560
02:28:06,670 --> 02:28:08,630
Kimura, are you confident?

9561
02:28:08,630 --> 02:28:10,290
Yes

9562
02:28:08,990 --> 02:28:11,510
100,000 Heipo on Yuuki Amami

9563
02:28:12,000 --> 02:28:15,490
Since I remember laughing until my sides hurt

9564
02:28:13,390 --> 02:28:14,630
Aha

9565
02:28:14,750 --> 02:28:17,740
Okay then, here is the correct answer

9566
02:28:17,740 --> 02:28:20,410
Are you all really okay with your picks?

9567
02:28:20,410 --> 02:28:24,890
You can't change your answers, since there's a time limit

9568
02:28:24,890 --> 02:28:27,790
Anyone who wants to change their choice raise your hand, nope, you can't

9569
02:28:27,790 --> 02:28:30,510
You can't change! Okay, please take a look

9570
02:28:33,130 --> 02:28:34,730
The correct answer is...

9571
02:28:35,690 --> 02:28:37,170
If you had to say which one?

9572
02:28:37,170 --> 02:28:40,990
I'm feeling that the two in the middle are gonna battle it out

9573
02:28:40,990 --> 02:28:42,990
I think that'll be the case, yes

9574
02:28:42,990 --> 02:28:44,810
How will Takenaka do

9575
02:28:44,810 --> 02:28:47,710
Yes! Yes! Yes

9576
02:28:47,720 --> 02:28:49,170
Darn it!

9577
02:28:47,770 --> 02:28:49,290
Let's go!

9578
02:28:50,370 --> 02:28:52,370
Boo-yah!!

9579
02:28:52,370 --> 02:28:53,330
All right!

9580
02:28:53,330 --> 02:28:55,490
She blew the others out of the water!

9581
02:28:56,210 --> 02:28:57,030
The clear winner

9582
02:28:57,030 --> 02:28:58,610
And by that much, too

9583
02:28:57,030 --> 02:29:03,050
The correct answer was Yuuki Amami with a commanding lead of 82 times

9584
02:29:03,050 --> 02:29:03,990
By that much!

9585
02:29:04,020 --> 02:29:06,230
And Takenaka was the worst?

9586
02:29:06,230 --> 02:29:07,590
Yeah, that was unexpected

9587
02:29:08,250 --> 02:29:09,640
It's like, he was going "aaahhh"

9588
02:29:09,650 --> 02:29:14,590
And just joking around by himself, right?

9589
02:29:10,630 --> 02:29:11,890
I guess so

9590
02:29:11,890 --> 02:29:14,290
We did laugh though

9591
02:29:14,590 --> 02:29:17,220
There weren't many breaks between hits

9592
02:29:15,130 --> 02:29:17,070
Right, exactly

9593
02:29:17,070 --> 02:29:19,070
There wasn't really a story behind it

9594
02:29:17,070 --> 02:29:19,210
Oh, that makes sense

9595
02:29:19,210 --> 02:29:20,210
This is risky

Hosei, this was it. You could have made a comeback!

9612

Trapped in the inescapable darkness

9914

9915

9921
02:34:41,690 --> 02:34:43,190
I wondered who would join in

9922
02:34:44,160 --> 02:34:45,360
It would suck if too many joined in

9923
02:34:45,360 --> 02:34:47,970
It would suck if too many joined in

9924
02:34:48,270 --> 02:34:49,970

02:39:02,600 --> 02:39:06,170

02:39:07,590 --> 02:39:12,860

Salt grilled saury!

10086
02:39:11,980 --> 02:39:39,210
Salt grilled saury

10087
02:39:12,900 --> 02:39:39,210
Let's eat! Salt grilled saury! There's so much fat on der~

10088
02:39:20,200 --> 02:39:39,210
Let's eat! Salt grilled saury! There's so much fat on there~

10089
02:39:23,010 --> 02:39:23,920
What an idiot

10090
02:39:25,630 --> 02:39:26,990
This is the worst

10091
02:39:26,740 --> 02:39:39,210
If there's so much fat on it, oh yeah, now is the time for salt grilling~

10092
02:39:36,920 --> 02:39:38,520
Hosei did so good here

10093
02:39:38,520 --> 02:39:39,610
That was the hook

10094
02:39:39,610 --> 02:39:41,810
That was the hook

10095
02:39:41,130 --> 02:39:41,810
Yes

02:39:41,980 --> 02:39:47,620

Next is Hamada

Really? I don't remember
anything about this part

10101
02:39:44,400 --> 02:39:47,630
From here, we have questions for you

10102
02:39:46,460 --> 02:39:47,620
Question?

10103
02:39:47,630 --> 02:39:48,570
What? Question?

10104
02:39:48,100 --> 02:39:49,370
I don't remember it here

10105
02:39:50,070 --> 02:39:51,390
Please remember this

10106
02:39:50,070 --> 02:39:52,700
Music, start!!

10107
02:39:51,650 --> 02:39:52,700

10114

Fried Rice

10115

Fried rice, potstickers, or sweet &

10116

Sour pork, which is my favorite?

10117
02:40:01,380 --> 02:40:02,550
He's bringing up other dishes

10118
02:40:07,670 --> 02:40:09,140
You must be kidding me

10119
02:40:09,700 --> 02:40:10,990
What was it?

10120
02:40:10,690 --> 02:40:17,290
Here is the question: What did Hamada sing after this?

10121
02:40:12,510 --> 02:40:13,370
What did he say?

10122
02:40:12,520 --> 02:40:13,270
What?

10123
02:40:17,290 --> 02:42:04,500
Fried rice, potstickers, sweet & sour pork

10124
02:40:17,290 --> 02:42:04,500
Question:

10125
02:40:17,290 --> 02:42:04,500
What did Hamada sing?

10126
02:40:17,290 --> 02:42:04,500
Which one is my favorite???

10129
02:40:17,390 --> 02:40:19,730
And here's the question

10130
02:40:20,800 --> 02:40:23,320
What did Hamada sing after that?

10131
02:40:23,320 --> 02:40:24,950
Write it down, please

10132
02:40:25,240 --> 02:40:26,740
I wonder...

10133
02:40:25,540 --> 02:40:27,000
What was it?

10134
02:40:27,470 --> 02:40:28,840
This is hard

10135
02:40:28,690 --> 02:40:29,560
It's too hard

10136
02:40:29,570 --> 02:40:32,490
Hamada's got an advantage

10137
02:40:30,960 --> 02:40:32,430
That's right, it's not fair

10138
02:40:32,430 --> 02:40:33,880
I bet you're right

10139
02:40:33,010 --> 02:40:34,730
I mean, he said it himself...

10140
02:40:34,130 --> 02:40:36,610
I sang it, that's true, but...

10141
02:40:36,610 --> 02:40:38,420
How many years ago was that?

10142
02:40:38,520 --> 02:40:42,650
It's from 6 years ago, No Laughing Prison, 2014

10143
02:40:42,650 --> 02:40:44,760
Did I say it in a weird way?

10144
02:40:44,760 --> 02:40:48,260
Let's say you said something out of your character...

10145
02:40:45,490 --> 02:40:46,870
No

10146
02:40:46,870 --> 02:40:48,230
Out of character...

10147
02:40:48,990 --> 02:40:49,980
I think I got it

10148
02:40:50,260 --> 02:40:52,110
Maybe me too

10149
02:40:52,500 --> 02:40:55,400
Let's reveal your answers, starting from Tanaka

10150
02:40:55,430 --> 02:40:56,050
Alright

10151
02:40:55,750 --> 02:40:56,720
Let's see

10152
02:40:58,070 --> 02:41:00,000
I thought of something he wouldn't say

10153
02:40:59,340 --> 02:41:00,690
"Which one do I like the most?"

10154
02:41:01,360 --> 02:41:02,610
"Little me has no clue"

10155
02:41:03,770 --> 02:41:05,610
I see, it's something like this!

10156
02:41:04,980 --> 02:41:08,230
Exactly, there's no way he would say that

10157
02:41:07,900 --> 02:41:09,850
I never heard him say it...

10158
02:41:09,310 --> 02:41:10,550
Alright, it's up to you, Kimura

10159
02:41:10,630 --> 02:41:12,570
I mean, you're not wrong

10160
02:41:12,830 --> 02:41:14,740
Let's see, Kimura

10161
02:41:13,980 --> 02:41:17,350
That's Chinatown's
hot steel plate

10162
02:41:14,000 --> 02:41:17,150
"A Chinese restaurant's hot grill"

10163
02:41:17,240 --> 02:41:18,790
"A Chinese restaurant's hot grill"?

10164
02:41:17,350 --> 02:41:19,560
That's Chinatown's
hot steel plate

10165
02:41:18,910 --> 02:41:21,010
Makes sense, it's potstickers, fried rice and sweet & sour pork

10166
02:41:20,760 --> 02:41:22,930
They're popular Chinese dishes, makes sense

10167
02:41:21,140 --> 02:41:22,640
I can see that

10168
02:41:23,040 --> 02:41:24,480
Your turn, Matsumoto

10169
02:41:25,000 --> 02:41:28,130
I feel like I took a completely different direction

10170
02:41:28,820 --> 02:41:30,930
So, "which one do I like the most?"

10171
02:41:30,930 --> 02:41:34,040
"Of course it's my wife!"

10172
02:41:32,740 --> 02:41:34,100
Of course it's my wife

10173
02:41:34,040 --> 02:41:35,060
He'd never say that

10174
02:41:34,520 --> 02:41:36,320
I mean, it's because

10175
02:41:36,320 --> 02:41:39,590
It was right after he had an affair

10176
02:41:36,320 --> 02:41:43,580
T/N: Hamada was revealed to be having an affair with a gravure idol in 2014. He made a public apology and his wife forgave him.

10177
02:41:37,910 --> 02:41:38,860
Right after that?

10178
02:41:38,760 --> 02:41:40,360
Yeah, that's why

10179
02:41:39,880 --> 02:41:40,980
I see

10180
02:41:40,360 --> 02:41:41,350
For his image, huh?

10181
02:41:41,780 --> 02:41:43,580
You could almost hear his intentions

10182
02:41:43,160 --> 02:41:44,420
Yeah, that's right

10183
02:41:44,050 --> 02:41:46,280
I don't think it's any of those yet,

10184
02:41:46,280 --> 02:41:48,240
Maybe I'm wrong with mine too...

10185
02:41:47,790 --> 02:41:49,290
Let's see your answer

10186
02:41:50,470 --> 02:41:52,020
"I try to ask myself"

10187
02:41:50,800 --> 02:41:52,390
I try to
ask myself

10188
02:41:52,840 --> 02:41:54,680
Yes, it was something like that!

10189
02:41:54,140 --> 02:41:56,160
Yeah, that's it!

10190
02:41:55,090 --> 02:41:57,040
"Ask myself," yes!

10191
02:41:57,560 --> 02:41:58,800
It's not something you'd say

10192
02:41:58,960 --> 02:41:59,850
I mean, Hamada

10193
02:41:59,660 --> 02:42:01,900
"I try to ask myself"

10194
02:42:00,710 --> 02:42:04,420
Yeah, that's right, it was something like this

10195
02:42:04,030 --> 02:42:05,270
"Ask myself", that's it

10196
02:42:04,500 --> 02:42:04,690

10197

50,000

10208
02:42:04,870 --> 02:42:08,140
Hamada's answer is worth 200,000 Heipos

10209
02:42:09,660 --> 02:42:10,660
Now,

10210
02:42:09,970 --> 02:42:10,810
Is that it?

10211
02:42:10,660 --> 02:42:12,930
Let's reveal the answer

10212
02:42:12,940 --> 02:42:14,410
Alright, people, here it comes

10213
02:42:14,230 --> 02:42:15,330
You don't have to say that

10214
02:42:14,650 --> 02:42:16,930
You're absolutely right, let's go!

10215
02:42:18,080 --> 02:42:18,950
Answer:

10216
02:42:18,970 --> 02:42:19,980

Fried rice!

10224
02:42:21,820 --> 02:42:35,980
Fried rice, potstickers, or sweet & sour pork, which

10225
02:42:21,820 --> 02:42:35,980
Is my favourite? I tried to ask it to myself

10226
02:42:27,570 --> 02:42:28,780
He's naming other dishes!

10227
02:42:35,720 --> 02:42:36,880
Incredible!

10228
02:42:35,980 --> 02:42:50,350
Beloved fried rice!

10229
02:42:35,980 --> 02:42:50,350
But when I go to a Chinese restaurant, I always order my

10230
02:42:38,300 --> 02:42:40,120
I'm surprised I remembered it

10231
02:42:40,800 --> 02:42:42,020
His voice sounds funny too

10232
02:42:45,730 --> 02:42:47,380
Not bad at all

10233
02:42:51,450 --> 02:42:54,620
I really don't like how other dishes made an appearance!

10234
02:42:53,330 --> 02:42:54,620
I really don't like how other dishes made an appearance!

10235
02:42:53,980 --> 02:42:55,020
I agree

10236
02:42:54,720 --> 02:42:55,950
That's not fair

10237
02:42:55,120 --> 02:42:58,990
But the most annoying part was "I tried to ask myself"!

10238
02:42:57,640 --> 02:42:59,540
That's right

10239
02:43:00,660 --> 02:43:03,760
His old geezer aura is really incredible!

m 543 903 l 1369.5 903 1369.5 1030.5 543 1030.5

10244
02:43:06,360 --> 02:43:07,310
The answer was:

10245
02:43:07,310 --> 02:43:09,980
"I try to ask myself"

10246
02:43:09,830 --> 02:43:17,140
Endo

10247
02:43:09,830 --> 02:43:17,140
Hamada

10248
02:43:09,830 --> 02:43:17,140
Hosei

10249
02:43:09,830 --> 02:43:17,140
Kimura

10250
02:43:09,830 --> 02:43:17,140
Matsumoto

10251
02:43:09,830 --> 02:43:17,140

10258
02:43:09,980 --> 02:43:11,440
Nicely done

10259
02:43:11,050 --> 02:43:12,890
That was perfect, Hamada

10260
02:43:12,790 --> 02:43:13,670
Thank you

10261
02:43:12,970 --> 02:43:15,160
"I tried to ask it to myself", that's exactly it

10262
02:43:15,590 --> 02:43:16,720
He clearly remembered it

10263
02:43:17,140 --> 02:43:21,580
But it was a hard question, wasn't it?

10264
02:43:18,610 --> 02:43:20,130
Really hard

10265
02:43:19,230 --> 02:43:21,700
Yeah, right out of the blue

10266
02:43:21,580 --> 02:43:25,720
Who do you think is the best at this?

10267
02:43:23,760 --> 02:43:25,930
The best at this? It's hard for all of us

10268
02:43:25,550 --> 02:43:26,570
I see, I see

10269
02:43:26,770 --> 02:43:28,440
I see, there's no answer, then

10270
02:43:29,490 --> 02:43:31,960
You're glaring at us, Matsumoto

10271
02:43:31,960 --> 02:43:35,860
You can't do this, right, Kimura?

10272
02:43:33,720 --> 02:43:35,680
Of course she can't

10273
02:43:35,330 --> 02:43:37,080
She's not looking

10274
02:43:36,040 --> 02:43:38,300
Are you okay, Kimura? And you, Daigo?

10275
02:43:36,840 --> 02:43:38,250
Everything alright?

10276
02:43:38,550 --> 02:43:39,660
Yeah, and you, Daigo?

10277
02:43:39,750 --> 02:43:40,600
The song was...

10278
02:43:39,910 --> 02:43:43,230
No, I'm not good at this and I don't remember, but that's not what I'm saying

10279
02:43:43,500 --> 02:43:44,770
What we're doing today...

10280
02:43:44,400 --> 02:43:45,470
There it is!

10281
02:43:45,170 --> 02:43:48,240
Sacchan is ready

10282
02:43:45,820 --> 02:43:47,870
Here comes Sacchan!

10283
02:43:48,340 --> 02:43:49,310
Thank you so much

10284
02:43:49,310 --> 02:43:52,090
Give me a break, we showed so many funny moments!!

10285
02:43:52,030 --> 02:43:53,490
Sacchan!

10286
02:43:53,710 --> 02:43:56,400
It's the same as before

10287
02:43:55,310 --> 02:43:56,880
Come on...

10288
02:43:56,500 --> 02:43:58,700
Really, the same exact thing

10289
02:43:57,600 --> 02:43:58,600
It's the same

10290
02:43:58,430 --> 02:43:59,920
I agree

10291
02:43:58,780 --> 02:44:02,320
It's the same situation as before

10292
02:43:59,920 --> 02:44:00,720
Really

10293
02:44:02,900 --> 02:44:05,970
It's time to show you a perfect one

10294
02:44:04,990 --> 02:44:05,740
Really!?

10295
02:44:04,990 --> 02:44:06,220
If you please

10296
02:44:05,970 --> 02:44:09,390
Kimura, feel free to choose a topic

10297
02:44:06,970 --> 02:44:08,080
Sounds good

10298
02:44:08,760 --> 02:44:09,840
Some food

10299
02:44:09,480 --> 02:44:10,440
Food?

10300
02:44:10,680 --> 02:44:11,510
Let's go

10301
02:44:11,080 --> 02:44:15,300
Praise

10302
02:44:11,250 --> 02:44:15,300
Praise

10303
02:44:11,550 --> 02:44:11,780
Chidori's Daigo

10304
02:44:11,550 --> 02:44:11,780
Sing a song to praise the food

10305
02:44:11,710 --> 02:44:14,360
So, it's time for Daigo to sing a song

10306
02:44:11,780 --> 02:44:15,300
Chidori's Daigo

10307
02:44:11,780 --> 02:44:15,300
Sing a song to praise the food

10308
02:44:12,580 --> 02:44:13,280
Oh boy...

10309
02:44:15,800 --> 02:44:18,590
So, it's time for Daigo to sing a song

10310
02:44:17,570 --> 02:44:41,020
Daigo

10311
02:44:17,570 --> 02:44:41,020

Sushi

10317
02:44:21,150 --> 02:44:41,020

10319
02:44:22,970 --> 02:44:41,020
The ingredients are on the top, the rice is balled up, with a bit of wasabi

10320
02:44:29,080 --> 02:44:41,020
I can see the capabilities of the chef, but the sushi portion is

10321
02:44:33,780 --> 02:44:41,020
Lacking by this much, sushi

10322
02:44:37,100 --> 02:44:38,210
Let's stop this

10323
02:44:39,040 --> 02:44:39,920
I had enough

10324
02:44:41,020 --> 02:44:47,300
The worst part is when I can't even decide what part was the worst

10325
02:44:47,870 --> 02:44:49,830
For a second, I thought I was even doing great!

10326
02:44:48,420 --> 02:44:49,730
Now you know

10327
02:44:50,380 --> 02:44:51,030
I agree

10328
02:44:50,870 --> 02:44:51,540
That's right

10329
02:44:51,870 --> 02:44:52,940
Hey, Daigo

10330
02:44:52,940 --> 02:44:55,110
Show us your armpit

10331
02:44:54,200 --> 02:44:55,540
Check this out!

10332
02:44:55,970 --> 02:44:57,060
That's unbelievable

10333
02:44:57,720 --> 02:44:58,440
Daigo!

10334
02:44:58,280 --> 02:44:59,740
That's too much sweat

10335
02:45:00,030 --> 02:45:01,040
It's all in there

10336
02:45:02,160 --> 02:45:03,110
Holy crap

10337
02:45:03,360 --> 02:45:06,950
His armpit sweat is covering his whole body

10338
02:45:05,920 --> 02:45:08,190
As soon as I said "sushi", it erupted

10339
02:45:09,890 --> 02:45:12,320
We can't end it on this note

10340
02:45:11,120 --> 02:45:13,670
It gets weird even if you don't intend to

10341
02:45:13,120 --> 02:45:13,840
That's right

10342
02:45:14,440 --> 02:45:15,530
That's exactly it

10343
02:45:15,530 --> 02:45:17,010
Now I know it's impossible

10344
02:45:17,590 --> 02:45:20,100
You beside him, it's your turn

10345
02:45:18,810 --> 02:45:20,310
Yeah, Nobu should

10346
02:45:19,650 --> 02:45:21,530
W-Wait, please don't make me

10347
02:45:21,720 --> 02:45:23,570
Maybe he can

10348
02:45:23,780 --> 02:45:26,800
We should end this with his sweaty armpits!!

10349
02:45:27,000 --> 02:45:28,510
It's really hard, Nobu

10350
02:45:28,560 --> 02:45:29,390
Come on

10351
02:45:29,390 --> 02:45:31,280
Alright, give me a topic

10352
02:45:30,690 --> 02:45:31,730
Thanks!

10353
02:45:36,450 --> 02:45:56,900

Sweet &
Sour pork

10361
02:45:38,680 --> 02:45:56,900
Such a thick sauce, over awesome pork, so dismembered!

10362
02:45:44,790 --> 02:45:56,900
Alright folks, here's the pork party! How are we gonna eat it?

10363
02:45:50,640 --> 02:45:56,900
Pour some vinegar'n'bell peppers and yo!

10364
02:45:53,200 --> 02:45:55,520
What the?

10365
02:45:54,750 --> 02:45:56,320
The melody changed!

10366
02:45:57,400 --> 02:45:58,000
Why did it suddenly became a musical?

10367
02:45:58,000 --> 02:46:01,310
Why did it suddenly became a musical?

10368
02:46:04,840 --> 02:46:06,590
The sweet & sour pork...

10369
02:46:05,880 --> 02:46:08,710
It's like, the Disney version of sour & sweet pork

10370
02:46:10,010 --> 02:46:12,970
Let me buy this whole footage, I'll pay you 1 million!!

10371
02:46:13,880 --> 02:46:17,250
Time's up for Kimura, our guest

10372
02:46:17,520 --> 02:46:18,810
Yeah, that's it

10373
02:46:17,620 --> 02:46:21,290
Unexpectedly, she has to leave

10374
02:46:19,010 --> 02:46:21,010
Isn't she going to stay with us?

10375
02:46:21,290 --> 02:46:25,700
They told me there's something I can't see here, so...

10376
02:46:23,180 --> 02:46:24,910
Stop, say no more!

10377
02:46:25,310 --> 02:46:26,760
How was it, Kimura?

10378
02:46:27,100 --> 02:46:33,500
I wish I can come back here as someone

10379
02:46:27,100 --> 02:46:33,500
To make you laugh in the future

10380
02:46:31,420 --> 02:46:32,140
Please, do

10381
02:46:32,140 --> 02:46:33,200
An assassin, huh?

10382
02:46:34,870 --> 02:46:36,670
Counting on you, then

10383
02:46:35,310 --> 02:46:36,960
Take care

10384
02:46:36,970 --> 02:46:38,340
Thank you for having me

10385
02:46:37,010 --> 02:46:43,260
Leaving early for reasons

10386
02:46:38,640 --> 02:46:40,480
Alright then, Kimura

10387
02:46:40,480 --> 02:46:42,280
Alright Kimura, thanks

10388
02:46:40,530 --> 02:46:41,550
Come on

10389
02:46:41,240 --> 02:46:43,150
I'm scared now

10390
02:46:42,400 --> 02:46:43,450
What does that mean?

10391
02:46:43,330 --> 02:46:44,780
Thank you for coming

10392
02:46:44,670 --> 02:46:46,520
This can't mean anything good

10393
02:46:46,730 --> 02:46:48,340
Thanks for coming

10394
02:46:49,070 --> 02:46:50,340
And now, folks...

10395
02:46:50,450 --> 02:46:53,790
We have another group of guests, please come here!!

10396
02:46:52,460 --> 02:46:53,770
Ah, is that so?

10397
02:46:56,340 --> 02:46:59,000
Ryuhei Ueshima

10398
02:46:56,340 --> 02:46:59,000
Tetsuro Degawa

10399
02:46:56,390 --> 02:46:59,180
It's Ryuhei Ueshima and Tetsuro Degawa

10400
02:46:59,050 --> 02:47:00,300
That's gotta be it, then...

10401
02:46:59,960 --> 02:47:01,430
Thanks for coming here

10402
02:47:02,920 --> 02:47:05,070
Now I get it...

10403
02:47:05,270 --> 02:47:07,000
Those two came here, and so...

10404
02:47:06,640 --> 02:47:07,770
That's right

10405
02:47:07,950 --> 02:47:10,640
As you know, when Ueshima and Degawa

10406
02:47:10,640 --> 02:47:13,340
Are in the same room, it's bad news...

10407
02:47:12,680 --> 02:47:13,710
Stop it

10408
02:47:13,710 --> 02:47:14,630
It's a fact

10409
02:47:14,510 --> 02:47:18,170
Did Kimura's agency forbid her to meet us in real life?

10410
02:47:18,400 --> 02:47:21,440
She actually wanted to stay here

10411
02:47:20,850 --> 02:47:22,840
Yeah you know, policies and stuff

10412

10770
02:48:06,610 --> 02:48:08,620
This year

10771
02:48:06,700 --> 02:48:08,620
This year

10772
02:48:06,760 --> 02:48:08,620
This year

10773
02:48:06,900 --> 02:48:10,080
This year...

10774
02:48:06,910 --> 02:48:08,250
However...

10775
02:48:08,250 --> 02:48:09,130
This year...

10776
02:48:10,320 --> 02:48:12,300
We've been told by the staff

10777
02:48:12,700 --> 02:48:18,110
'Cause we would end up being in close contact

10778
02:48:12,700 --> 02:48:18,110
That we can't do that this year,

10779
02:48:18,110 --> 02:48:20,080
Makes sense

10780
02:48:18,910 --> 02:48:20,210
I see

10781
02:48:20,190 --> 02:48:22,300
So we're doing it here, just the two of us

10782
02:48:22,080 --> 02:48:25,220
For us, this show is our personal

10783
02:48:22,080 --> 02:48:25,220
T/N: "Kohaku Uta Gassen" is the most popular New Years Eve TV special, followed by the Batsu.

10784
02:48:23,460 --> 02:48:25,220
Kohaku Uta Gassen!

10785
02:48:25,900 --> 02:48:26,880
Is that so?

10786
02:48:25,930 --> 02:48:27,170
That's right

10787
02:48:27,180 --> 02:48:28,820
I mean, it's being ten years!

10788
02:48:27,380 --> 02:48:28,470
Is it that important?

10789
02:48:29,350 --> 02:48:33,070
If we can't do it,

10790
02:48:30,200 --> 02:48:33,070
We can't end this year, you know!!

10791
02:48:30,850 --> 02:48:32,870
That's right, it's really important

10792
02:48:34,290 --> 02:48:38,260
So, what do you want to do this time?

10793
02:48:35,730 --> 02:48:36,560
That's right

10794
02:48:38,500 --> 02:48:39,810
Of course, what we wanna do...

10795
02:48:41,730 --> 02:48:44,120
It's a scrotum tug of war

10796
02:48:41,730 --> 02:48:44,120
It's a tug of balls

10797
02:48:44,180 --> 02:48:46,200
I have no idea what they said

10798
02:48:46,100 --> 02:48:47,320
Tug of what?

10799
02:48:46,200 --> 02:48:48,410
Their unison voice didn't work at all

10800
02:48:47,190 --> 02:48:48,160
What's that?

10801
02:48:48,410 --> 02:48:52,010
A tug of war with our balls

10802
02:48:50,090 --> 02:48:51,440
Ah, with your balls?

10803
02:48:52,010 --> 02:48:53,760
And what should we do by watching it?

10804
02:48:53,940 --> 02:48:55,980
You don't have to bet anything here

10805
02:48:55,150 --> 02:48:55,800
We don't?

10806
02:48:55,980 --> 02:48:57,860
It can happen in a real casino, you know

10807
02:48:58,250 --> 02:49:01,520
Like, an unknown singer shows up or such

10808
02:49:00,800 --> 02:49:02,790
Is that what we're going through?

10809
02:49:01,700 --> 02:49:03,240
Kind of

10810
02:49:02,400 --> 02:49:03,340
What the?

10811
02:49:03,350 --> 02:49:04,550
An unknown singer!?

10812
02:49:04,890 --> 02:49:08,490
It's like going to Okinawa and

10813
02:49:04,890 --> 02:49:08,490
T/N: BEGIN is a popular Okinawan pop band.

10814
02:49:06,320 --> 02:49:08,490
Someone you don't know starts singing BEGIN

10815
02:49:07,860 --> 02:49:08,780
That's not it!

10816
02:49:10,030 --> 02:49:10,040
I can tell you're being rude here!

10817
02:49:10,040 --> 02:49:10,090
I can tell you're being rude here!

10818
02:49:10,090 --> 02:49:10,130
I can tell you're being rude here!

10819
02:49:10,130 --> 02:49:10,140
I can tell you're being rude here!

10820
02:49:10,140 --> 02:49:10,190
I can tell you're being rude here!

10821
02:49:10,190 --> 02:49:10,230
I can tell you're being rude here!

10822
02:49:10,230 --> 02:49:10,930
I can tell you're being rude here!

10823
02:49:10,930 --> 02:49:13,600
I can tell you're being rude here!

10824
02:49:11,800 --> 02:49:13,400
That's not what we are!

10825
02:49:13,400 --> 02:49:15,600
I mean, it's something an actress can't see

10826
02:49:15,170 --> 02:49:17,330
That's right, Kimura just left

10827
02:49:17,430 --> 02:49:21,610
So you'll do something that will be that exciting

10828
02:49:20,270 --> 02:49:21,400
That's right

10829
02:49:22,170 --> 02:49:23,870
Bring that thing out already!

10830
02:49:25,860 --> 02:49:27,130
What is it?

10831
02:49:27,240 --> 02:49:29,810
We gotta do this, or else the year won't end

10832
02:49:29,710 --> 02:49:30,880
I mean, you're right

10833
02:49:30,700 --> 02:49:32,070
It's their "Kohaku"

10834
02:49:30,980 --> 02:49:32,500
Check that out

10835
02:49:32,970 --> 02:49:35,020
We're ready for this

10836
02:49:35,090 --> 02:49:37,050
Say Tecchan, you gained weight again, didn't you?

10837
02:49:37,250 --> 02:49:38,490
Alright!

10838
02:49:38,760 --> 02:49:40,360
Let's do this

10839
02:49:40,410 --> 02:49:41,910
Bring it!

10840
02:49:42,040 --> 02:49:43,440
They look like small sumo wrestlers

10841
02:49:44,190 --> 02:49:46,410
Daigo!

10842
02:49:46,410 --> 02:49:49,630
Pinch it on my dick... Um... I mean, balls!

10843
02:49:48,880 --> 02:49:50,580
He has no idea what he's saying

10844
02:49:50,820 --> 02:49:51,690
Is that how it works?

10845
02:49:51,720 --> 02:49:57,610
Placing clothespins on their scrotums for a

10846
02:49:51,720 --> 02:49:57,610
Tug of war match

10847
02:49:53,100 --> 02:49:53,650
Nobu

10848
02:49:53,690 --> 02:49:54,070
Yes?

10849
02:49:54,070 --> 02:49:54,650
You do the same

10850
02:49:54,650 --> 02:49:55,590
Sure, got it

10851
02:49:55,590 --> 02:49:56,740
Pinch my balls properly

10852
02:49:56,910 --> 02:49:59,110
On your balls, you say...

10853
02:49:57,920 --> 02:49:59,180
Yeah, pinch 'em for good

10854
02:49:59,310 --> 02:50:00,980
This is gonna hurt

10855
02:50:01,060 --> 02:50:02,530
Make sure it's on there good

10856
02:50:03,210 --> 02:50:04,760
This is quite tight though, eh?

10857
02:50:04,410 --> 02:50:05,250
Ow, that hurt!

10858
02:50:05,550 --> 02:50:11,240
It's like a threeleaf arrowhead.* It's all hardened

10859
02:50:05,550 --> 02:50:11,240
T/N: Similar to the water chestnut. Often a part of Japanese New Years cuisine

10860
02:50:08,150 --> 02:50:08,770
What...

10861
02:50:11,250 --> 02:50:14,410
Those things that all of Japan will be eating tomorrow

10862
02:50:13,720 --> 02:50:14,410
That's right

10863
02:50:14,420 --> 02:50:15,840
It's shrunken up

10864
02:50:15,890 --> 02:50:19,230
And looks like one of those hot stones you put in a tsukemen.*

10865
02:50:15,890 --> 02:50:19,230
T/N: A variant of ramen where the noodles and the soup are served separately

10866
02:50:19,230 --> 02:50:21,210
Here we go

10867
02:50:19,230 --> 02:50:21,210
Right then, here we go

10868
02:50:22,000 --> 02:50:22,750
Yup, okay

10869
02:50:22,880 --> 02:50:23,980
Ow ow ow

10870
02:50:23,270 --> 02:50:24,630
There we go

10871
02:50:25,440 --> 02:50:25,940
It's on

10872
02:50:25,970 --> 02:50:28,470
You haven't even tried to-- you haven't touched my sack once

10873
02:50:28,470 --> 02:50:31,610
That's not good, Daigo. You got to do it properly.

10874
02:50:29,870 --> 02:50:30,640
Daigo!

10875
02:50:30,660 --> 02:50:31,610
But, I mean, the sack...

10876
02:50:31,610 --> 02:50:33,010
Nobu did mine properly and touched mine

10877
02:50:33,010 --> 02:50:35,510
It's like he's dealing with something so dirty

10878
02:50:35,510 --> 02:50:37,060
You haven't touched it even once

10879
02:50:38,220 --> 02:50:40,280
Your left one is insane, you know?

10880
02:50:39,770 --> 02:50:40,270
What do you mean?

10881
02:50:40,280 --> 02:50:41,890
The size of your left one genuinely worries me.

10882
02:50:41,890 --> 02:50:42,950
The size of your left one genuinely worries me.

10883
02:50:42,950 --> 02:50:44,390
It's so different to the right one.

10884
02:50:44,390 --> 02:50:45,190
The left one is massive!!

10885
02:50:45,190 --> 02:50:46,960
The left one is massive!!

10886
02:50:45,990 --> 02:50:46,960
No no no...

10887
02:50:46,960 --> 02:50:49,110
It must be tough for you to walk, no?

10888
02:50:49,110 --> 02:50:51,680
No. Put it on, properly

10889
02:50:52,450 --> 02:50:54,000
Right, here we go, here we go

10890
02:50:54,050 --> 02:50:55,120
Here we go

10891
02:50:55,120 --> 02:50:56,070
Here it comes

10892
02:50:56,070 --> 02:50:56,450
Yes

10893
02:50:56,900 --> 02:50:58,150
Right, here we go then

10894
02:50:58,570 --> 02:51:00,240
Tug of War with Balls

10895
02:51:00,640 --> 02:51:01,440
START!

10896
02:51:01,490 --> 02:51:03,360
Don't lose!

10897
02:51:03,760 --> 02:51:04,520
Come on!

10898
02:51:04,520 --> 02:51:06,260
Ouch ouch ouch

10899
02:51:06,890 --> 02:51:07,630
This has to hurt...

10900
02:51:07,540 --> 02:51:08,190
Don't lose now...

10901
02:51:07,640 --> 02:51:08,810
Give it up now

10902
02:51:08,810 --> 02:51:09,830
Ow, ow

10903
02:51:09,830 --> 02:51:10,610
Wait a second, hey!

10904
02:51:10,610 --> 02:51:11,830
Wait a second, hey!

10905
02:51:12,380 --> 02:51:16,320
Come to the red line!

10906
02:51:14,220 --> 02:51:16,320
It's tug of war!!

10907
02:51:17,170 --> 02:51:18,310
That's not the point of this game...

10908
02:51:18,520 --> 02:51:19,370
Are you an idiot?

10909
02:51:19,390 --> 02:51:23,040
The point of this game isn't to get to the red line...

10910
02:51:21,320 --> 02:51:23,040
That's right

10911
02:51:23,040 --> 02:51:25,360
Who would be the winner that way?

10912
02:51:25,380 --> 02:51:25,900
Ow ow

10913
02:51:26,100 --> 02:51:27,680
Hey Nobu

10914
02:51:27,850 --> 02:51:29,470
This battle is going nowhere

10915
02:51:29,470 --> 02:51:29,780
Yes

10916
02:51:29,780 --> 02:51:31,520
Go bring 'that' in

10917
02:51:30,330 --> 02:51:31,520
Oh, go get that...

10918
02:51:31,520 --> 02:51:32,370
This?

10919
02:51:32,370 --> 02:51:36,270
1L Plastic Bottle

10920
02:51:33,220 --> 02:51:35,570
Do you mean this?

10921
02:51:35,060 --> 02:51:36,240
Yep, that's the one!

10922
02:51:36,290 --> 02:51:37,570
Seriously

10923
02:51:36,440 --> 02:51:37,970
What are you gonna do with that?

10924
02:51:38,160 --> 02:51:38,880
Put it on

10925
02:51:38,880 --> 02:51:39,730
Are you serious?

10926
02:51:39,740 --> 02:51:40,890
Wow wow wow

10927
02:51:41,130 --> 02:51:42,260
Here I go then

10928
02:51:42,260 --> 02:51:42,650
Yes

10929
02:51:43,350 --> 02:51:44,360
Ready, set

10930
02:51:48,370 --> 02:51:49,420
I'm actually... fine

10931
02:51:49,420 --> 02:51:50,370
I'm actually... fine

10932
02:51:54,440 --> 02:51:55,490
I'm fine

10933
02:51:56,930 --> 02:51:59,460
The ringing of the bell...

10934
02:51:58,580 --> 02:51:59,460
I'm fine

10935
02:51:59,460 --> 02:52:00,210
That bell was for your lives in show business

10936
02:52:00,210 --> 02:52:01,600
That bell was for your lives in show business

10937
02:52:01,600 --> 02:52:04,370
That bell was for your lives in show business

10938
02:52:03,080 --> 02:52:04,370
Not yet

10939
02:52:04,870 --> 02:52:06,470
No, they still got it...

10940
02:52:07,000 --> 02:52:10,060
When the night view becomes beautiful

10941
02:52:07,000 --> 02:52:14,510
12 hours in

10942
02:52:10,060 --> 02:52:14,490
They say a certain game tournament at the hotel is held

10943
02:52:10,060 --> 02:52:14,510
Game Tournament

10944
02:52:14,690 --> 02:52:19,550
The 5 are told to change into track suits and arrive at the venue

10945
02:52:19,830 --> 02:52:20,600
Right guys

10946
02:52:21,120 --> 02:52:22,000
This is...

10947
02:52:22,650 --> 02:52:23,990
This is the venue of the game battle held by the hotel

10948
02:52:23,990 --> 02:52:26,570
This is the venue of the game battle held by the hotel

10949
02:52:25,340 --> 02:52:26,570
Game Battle?

10950
02:52:25,340 --> 02:52:26,570
Game Battle?

10951
02:52:26,570 --> 02:52:28,430
From here, you can laugh

10952
02:52:28,430 --> 02:52:31,530
But you can't lose at the battle no matter what. Ok, go

10953
02:52:32,550 --> 02:52:33,800
He's like "Ok, go"...

10954
02:52:34,560 --> 02:52:35,570
What's with that?

10955
02:52:35,970 --> 02:52:36,430
Huh?

10956
02:52:36,830 --> 02:52:37,720
Hello

10957
02:52:37,770 --> 02:52:41,710
Chihara Junior

10958
02:52:37,770 --> 02:52:41,710
Game Master

10959
02:52:38,670 --> 02:52:41,710
I've got a really bad feeling about this

10960
02:52:42,240 --> 02:52:48,310
Beat the Gaki Team!!

10961
02:52:42,240 --> 02:52:48,310
Supplanting Game Battle

10962
02:52:48,310 --> 02:52:49,680
Right, so here we are

10963
02:52:50,480 --> 02:52:52,770
I'd like to introduce your challengers

10964
02:52:52,770 --> 02:52:54,180
The guys you'll be going up against are...

10965
02:52:54,180 --> 02:52:57,190
These guys, come on in!

10966
02:53:01,170 --> 02:53:07,810
7th Generation Comedian Team

10967
02:53:01,170 --> 02:53:07,810
EXIT & Amefuri Myojo & Miki

10968
02:53:02,130 --> 02:53:05,380
The 7th Generation Comedian Team!

10969
02:53:05,380 --> 02:53:07,560
All right!

10970
02:53:09,330 --> 02:53:11,230
Hold on a second!!

10971
02:53:09,820 --> 02:53:11,230
Here we go, what is it!?

10972
02:53:11,230 --> 02:53:11,920
What is it?

10973
02:53:11,920 --> 02:53:13,920
Your jerseys are way too stylish

10974
02:53:12,970 --> 02:53:15,410
Stylish jerseys produced by EXIT

10975
02:53:14,020 --> 02:53:15,220
All right!

10976
02:53:15,410 --> 02:53:16,040
Ours don't even have pockets!!

10977
02:53:16,040 --> 02:53:18,780
Ours don't even have pockets!!

10978
02:53:18,780 --> 02:53:21,440
Your opponents are the Gaki members, what are your thoughts?

10979
02:53:21,780 --> 02:53:24,610
Honestly, it's going to be easy, right?

10980
02:53:24,610 --> 02:53:26,250
Whatever the contest, we will win

10981
02:53:26,280 --> 02:53:27,880
They're all just old men anyway

10982
02:53:28,080 --> 02:53:28,390
What?

10983
02:53:28,390 --> 02:53:28,590
What?

10984
02:53:28,590 --> 02:53:29,190
What?

10985
02:53:29,390 --> 02:53:31,620
You're all just old men, right?

10986
02:53:31,620 --> 02:53:34,060
You really can't hear me at all?

10987
02:53:34,420 --> 02:53:37,240
I thought you were saying something really funny, but when I heard it

10988
02:53:37,240 --> 02:53:40,660
I realised it was pretty basic...

10989
02:53:40,660 --> 02:53:42,170
Don't fall for their trap, man

10990
02:53:42,170 --> 02:53:43,250
He's trying to provoke us

10991
02:53:43,770 --> 02:53:45,370

10992
02:53:43,770 --> 02:53:48,710

You guys have 5, so

11001

What speed roughly is it?

11012
02:54:23,420 --> 02:54:28,610
(Initial speed) about 400 km/h

11013
02:54:25,330 --> 02:54:26,480
400!?

11014
02:54:26,710 --> 02:54:28,290
400!?

11015
02:54:27,240 --> 02:54:28,600
400km/h apparently!

11016
02:54:29,650 --> 02:54:32,520
None of you have seen that live, right?

11017
02:54:30,910 --> 02:54:31,870
Of course not

11018
02:54:33,020 --> 02:54:36,700

02:54:34,280 --> 02:54:35,220

We weren't told about this

11026
02:54:44,060 --> 02:54:52,700
The other will stand over a Dick Machine

11027
02:54:44,190 --> 02:54:52,700

Huh? What?

11030
02:54:52,700 --> 02:54:57,340
And then Momota will hit a super high-speed smash!

11031
02:54:52,700 --> 02:54:57,340
m 115.5 900 l 1804.5 900 1804.5 1017 115.5 1017

11038
02:55:07,180 --> 02:55:08,250
Wait wait...

11039
02:55:08,250 --> 02:55:08,900
What is it?

11040
02:55:09,390 --> 02:55:10,100
Did we do something wrong?

11041
02:55:10,100 --> 02:55:13,870
Did we do something wrong?

11042
02:55:13,870 --> 02:55:15,110
He came all the way down for this

11043
02:55:15,120 --> 02:55:16,560
You're gonna have to do this, again?

I mean, yeah but...

11048
02:55:20,600 --> 02:55:24,570
Momota picks the duo who will face the challenge

11049
02:55:23,930 --> 02:55:25,700
Momota, you little shit

11050
02:55:25,700 --> 02:55:27,100
It's Cocorico

11051
02:55:29,340 --> 02:55:32,680
Right, then!

11052
02:55:29,340 --> 02:55:33,580
Cocorico will take on the challenge

11053
02:55:32,680 --> 02:55:33,580
He's way too happy

11054
02:55:33,580 --> 02:55:34,560
Right, just setting up

11055
02:55:33,840 --> 02:55:39,280
Endo -> Paper Balloon

11056
02:55:33,840 --> 02:55:39,280
Tanaka -> Dick Machine

11057
02:55:34,560 --> 02:55:35,880
This is scary

11058
02:55:35,910 --> 02:55:38,230
I don't want to do this

11059
02:55:38,230 --> 02:55:39,300
What is gonna happen

11060
02:55:39,300 --> 02:55:41,970
Right then, let us proceed

11061
02:55:42,150 --> 02:55:43,950
Here we go!

11062
02:55:43,950 --> 02:55:44,840
Seriously, is this safe?

11063
02:55:47,670 --> 02:55:48,310
This is terrifying

11064
02:55:54,710 --> 02:55:56,170
Oh man!!

11065
02:55:56,170 --> 02:55:58,170
That was terrifying

11066
02:55:58,370 --> 02:56:00,940
What happened just now?

11067
02:56:00,940 --> 02:56:02,040
You moved

11068
02:56:02,040 --> 02:56:04,340
I didn't move

11069
02:56:02,790 --> 02:56:03,970
You can't move

11070
02:56:04,340 --> 02:56:06,310
That didn't hit

11071
02:56:05,510 --> 02:56:06,310
It didn't

11072
02:56:06,310 --> 02:56:09,850
So this is your last chance. Go ahead, Momota

11073
02:56:12,580 --> 02:56:13,280
This is scary

11074
02:56:13,280 --> 02:56:13,830
Please

11075
02:56:13,980 --> 02:56:14,720
This is terrifying

11076
02:56:22,890 --> 02:56:24,360
I am so sorry!

11077
02:56:23,330 --> 02:56:24,360
Which means!!

11078
02:56:26,030 --> 02:56:27,960
Shared responsibility Dick Machine punishment!

11079
02:56:26,950 --> 02:56:27,960
What the hell is this?

11080
02:56:30,920 --> 02:56:31,970
What the hell is going on?

11081
02:56:32,370 --> 02:56:33,540
Seriously, what is this!?

11082
02:56:33,840 --> 02:56:36,710
What is going on?

11083
02:56:37,040 --> 02:56:40,740
The first battle will be the "Classic Pose" competition

11084
02:56:40,980 --> 02:56:44,750
Do the same classic pose!!

11085
02:56:40,980 --> 02:56:44,750
Gaki vs 7th Generation

11086
02:56:43,180 --> 02:56:44,180
Here we go...

11087
02:56:45,230 --> 02:56:58,260
Takeda Tetsuya

11088
02:56:45,230 --> 02:56:58,260

11089
02:56:45,370 --> 02:56:52,720

11091
02:56:46,680 --> 02:56:47,270
Okay

11092
02:56:49,540 --> 02:56:51,300
This will be hard

11093
02:56:51,320 --> 02:56:53,660
If it's Takeda-san, we could do it...

11094
02:56:53,070 --> 02:56:58,240
m 112.5 900 l 1804.5 900 1804.5 1018.5 112.5 1018.5

11095
02:56:53,070 --> 02:56:58,260
Everyone does the same pose → CLEAR If they don't → Dick Machine

11096
02:56:55,170 --> 02:56:56,160
I see

11097
02:56:56,180 --> 02:56:57,240
Okay

11098
02:56:58,260 --> 02:57:02,870
Do the same classic pose!!

11099
02:56:58,260 --> 02:57:02,870
First up The 7th Generation Team

Here we go!

11101
02:57:03,270 --> 02:57:05,130
You can make it hit harder for these guys, since they're young

11102
02:57:05,130 --> 02:57:08,890
You can make it hit harder for these guys, since they're young

11103
02:57:07,940 --> 02:57:08,890
They all hit hard

11104
02:57:09,310 --> 02:57:14,140
You old men

11105
02:57:10,140 --> 02:57:14,140
Won't use them anymore so it's fine

11106
02:57:11,520 --> 02:57:14,140
That's why they're precious to us!

11107
02:57:13,690 --> 02:57:14,910
We use them, too

11108
02:57:14,910 --> 02:57:17,880
We don't use them that much, so come on

11109
02:57:18,360 --> 02:57:19,480
Then it's fine!

11110
02:57:19,850 --> 02:57:22,270
Right then, here we go. Of course, you guys

11111
02:57:22,290 --> 02:57:24,550
Have been on TV shows with each other

11112
02:57:24,550 --> 02:57:25,320
We got this

11113
02:57:25,320 --> 02:57:26,340
You know each other, right?

11114
02:57:26,340 --> 02:57:28,340
It's all about teamwork

11115
02:57:26,340 --> 02:57:29,260
Let's have them match poses

11116
02:57:28,340 --> 02:57:29,310
Let's make it perfect, guys

11117
02:57:29,310 --> 02:57:31,160
Your first subject is

11118
02:57:31,580 --> 02:57:33,160
Gold Medalist

11119
02:57:33,160 --> 02:57:35,160
Gold medalist?

11120
02:57:35,160 --> 02:57:37,170
Gold medalist??

11121
02:57:36,200 --> 02:57:37,170
Gold medalist??

11122
02:57:37,170 --> 02:57:39,840
Right then, here we go

11123
02:57:39,840 --> 02:57:41,840
Go for the most obvious one, guys!

11124
02:57:42,210 --> 02:58:29,350
Subject - Gold medalist

11125
02:57:42,210 --> 02:58:29,350
m 100.5 919.5 l 832.5 919.5 832.5 1023 100.5 1023

11126
02:57:42,320 --> 02:57:45,680
A classic pose by a gold medallist

11127
02:57:45,680 --> 02:57:46,690
Match poses!

11128
02:57:46,710 --> 02:57:47,380
This is an easy one

11129
02:57:48,290 --> 02:57:50,250
Surely we got this?

11130
02:58:00,110 --> 02:58:01,560
Which means...

11131
02:58:01,970 --> 02:58:03,210
No good!

11132
02:58:03,960 --> 02:58:06,310
Wait, what!?

11133
02:58:03,960 --> 02:58:06,310
What!?

11134
02:58:06,310 --> 02:58:07,110
I see...

11135
02:58:07,110 --> 02:58:08,260
First, Seiya

11136
02:58:07,110 --> 02:58:08,260
Yep

11137
02:58:08,770 --> 02:58:09,400
That's a medal and you're...

11138
02:58:09,450 --> 02:58:10,320
Biting

11139
02:58:09,570 --> 02:58:13,700
Biting the medal

11140
02:58:09,570 --> 02:58:13,700
m 1512 951 l 1812 951 1812 1014 1512 1014

11141
02:58:10,320 --> 02:58:11,170
Obviously

11142
02:58:11,170 --> 02:58:12,170
Biting

11143
02:58:12,190 --> 02:58:12,840
Biting

11144
02:58:12,850 --> 02:58:13,450
Biting

11145
02:58:15,810 --> 02:58:18,470
What the hell is that?

11146
02:58:18,470 --> 02:58:21,010
I was doing Momota...

11147
02:58:21,010 --> 02:58:27,480
Momota

11148
02:58:21,010 --> 02:58:27,480
m 1512 951 l 1810.5 951 1810.5 1012.5 1512 1012.5

11149
02:58:21,030 --> 02:58:22,300
When he smashes

11150
02:58:22,300 --> 02:58:23,600
From badminton...

11151
02:58:23,760 --> 02:58:26,370
When you think of a gold medal, you think of Momota

11152
02:58:26,370 --> 02:58:27,330
Isn't that right?

11153

11328
03:02:03,520 --> 03:02:06,140
Dick Machine

11329
03:02:06,460 --> 03:02:08,040
Oh no

11330
03:02:13,440 --> 03:02:14,360
OWWW!!!

11331
03:02:15,120 --> 03:02:16,600
I got hit on the tip

11332
03:02:16,600 --> 03:02:17,980
The tip, the tip

11333
03:02:17,980 --> 03:02:18,800
It went in

11334
03:02:18,800 --> 03:02:20,520
Right on the tip

11335
03:02:20,640 --> 03:02:22,480
Falling down was really bad

11336
03:02:20,850 --> 03:02:28,530
Clapping Punch

Not falling down

11345
03:02:23,820 --> 03:02:24,400
Right

11346
03:02:24,600 --> 03:02:26,820
Did you think everyone was going to say "falling down?"

11347
03:02:26,820 --> 03:02:28,530
A gag, definitely

11348
03:02:28,530 --> 03:02:32,530
If it was a gag I thought we'd never match, there's too many legends

11349
03:02:32,530 --> 03:02:38,570
But if it's falling down there's only one...

11350
03:02:36,100 --> 03:02:38,480
What is falling down? I don't know what the hell you mean

11351
03:02:38,590 --> 03:02:40,250
No one is called "falling down"

11352
03:02:40,700 --> 03:02:42,120
Okay, here we go

11353
03:02:42,120 --> 03:02:43,360
This is your theme

11354
03:02:43,360 --> 03:02:44,540

This is doable

11359

Oh, okay

11360
03:02:50,780 --> 03:02:52,800
Doable, okay

11361
03:02:52,800 --> 03:02:53,860
This is a lucky question

11362
03:02:53,860 --> 03:02:54,650
Do the one!

11363
03:02:54,650 --> 03:02:56,320
Do an easy pose okay

11364
03:02:56,320 --> 03:02:58,540
A typical figure skating pose

I have no idea

11367

Hamada doesn't get it either

11368
03:03:03,540 --> 03:03:04,740
This is simple

11369
03:03:04,740 --> 03:03:05,920
Do a clear pose

11370
03:03:06,800 --> 03:03:07,800

11371

Good, good

11373

Oh no

11374
03:03:12,580 --> 03:03:13,300
This is it

11375
03:03:13,620 --> 03:03:14,420

Really hurts

Hamada

This was a totally free question

11395

What was that

11396
03:03:42,540 --> 03:03:44,100
What pose did you do?

11397
03:03:43,480 --> 03:03:44,030
What did you do?

11398
03:03:45,360 --> 03:03:46,640
What was this again?

11412

If all 6 succeed in a row they are CLEAR!!

11413
03:04:05,500 --> 03:04:06,820
Okay everyone,

11414
03:04:06,820 --> 03:04:10,680
You will attempt simple problems anyone can do

11415
03:04:10,680 --> 03:04:14,040
If all six in the group can do the problem in one go, you've cleared it

11416
03:04:14,040 --> 03:04:17,120
If even one person messes up along the way it's collective responsibility

11417
03:04:17,140 --> 03:04:17,940
All six get the Dick Machine

11418
03:04:17,940 --> 03:04:20,370

11420
03:04:20,970 --> 03:04:22,740
Is it always going to be the Dick Machine?

11421
03:04:23,210 --> 03:04:26,310
I'm going to be a stickler about it

11422

11484
03:04:43,060 --> 03:04:45,100
What kind of put-down was that

11485
03:04:45,100 --> 03:04:51,400
Next, the Gaki team will try "All 6 Succeed in a Row!!"

11486

E.T. By Yourself

11487

What's that

11488
03:04:51,500 --> 03:04:52,080
What is it

11489
03:04:52,080 --> 03:04:55,280
From hands outstretched

If you can touch your pointer fingers together without bending your arms you are CLEAR

11491
03:04:56,020 --> 03:04:57,580

You succeed if you can touch your pointer fingers together

11494
03:04:58,400 --> 03:05:00,440
Don't do it

11495

Don't do it okay

11496

I can do that

11502

Or if you are too slow, you are OUT

11505
03:05:09,150 --> 03:05:13,060
We can do something this simple

11506
03:05:10,840 --> 03:05:11,620
That's right

11507
03:05:11,620 --> 03:05:12,400
I can do it

11508
03:05:13,060 --> 03:05:14,530
You only have to touch the fingertips of your right and left hand

11509
03:05:14,530 --> 03:05:15,560
You only have to touch the fingertips of your right and left hand

11510

You only have to touch the fingertips of your right and left hand

11511
03:05:19,200 --> 03:05:21,130
We're making fun of this

11512
03:05:21,440 --> 03:05:22,330
But my partner hasn't said a word

11513
03:05:22,330 --> 03:05:25,500
But my partner hasn't said a word

11514
03:05:25,060 --> 03:05:25,500
Why hasn't he said anything?

11515
03:05:26,740 --> 03:05:28,910
The sense of uneasiness is brutal

11516
03:05:28,920 --> 03:05:30,980
Okay here we go

11517
03:05:30,980 --> 03:05:31,920

That's fine

11522
03:05:33,860 --> 03:05:35,180
It's the most basic

11523
03:05:35,550 --> 03:05:37,350
If one person messes up then it's all no good?

11524
03:05:36,780 --> 03:05:37,350
You're OUT then

11525
03:05:37,740 --> 03:05:38,280
Well

11526
03:05:38,280 --> 03:05:41,420

Oh no...

11531
03:05:41,430 --> 03:05:43,720
You gotta do it right!!

11532
03:05:43,040 --> 03:05:43,920
Don't pressure him

11533
03:05:43,720 --> 03:05:45,560
100% having the opposite effect

11534
03:05:45,560 --> 03:05:46,520
What a bad leader

11535
03:05:46,700 --> 03:05:49,140
Here we go with E.T. by Yourself

11536
03:05:49,140 --> 03:05:51,380
Momota go ahead

11537
03:05:58,240 --> 03:06:02,710

11538

11539

I'm not!

11555
03:06:27,750 --> 03:06:27,930

Hang on

11576
03:06:35,140 --> 03:06:37,910
He fine-tuned it

11577
03:06:37,910 --> 03:06:39,460
His speed was slow

11578
03:06:39,490 --> 03:06:42,210
Hey, we're on the same team

11579
03:06:42,210 --> 03:06:43,650
He doesn't want to do it

11580
03:06:44,400 --> 03:06:45,650
Whose side are you on?

11581
03:06:45,650 --> 03:06:46,580
Sorry

11587

Kanechika that's no good

11665
03:09:00,090 --> 03:09:02,290
You have to clench it skillfully

11666

But just now Matsumoto

11667
03:09:05,160 --> 03:09:07,830
Actually you were out but I let it go right?

About three times...!

11669

Stop!!

11673
03:09:12,660 --> 03:09:14,100
Stop that!!

11674
03:09:14,670 --> 03:09:16,300
It was the first try so...

11675

This is impossible

11698

No it isn't

11699
03:09:41,560 --> 03:09:42,450
Let's keep this rolling

11700
03:09:42,450 --> 03:09:43,670
It ends here

11701
03:09:43,760 --> 03:09:45,010

He's okay

11708
03:10:02,210 --> 03:10:03,450
That was pretty ugly

11709
03:10:03,720 --> 03:10:05,620
Was this okay?

11710
03:10:05,630 --> 03:10:08,720
Rintaro succeeds

11711
03:10:07,780 --> 03:10:08,720
Nice

11712
03:10:08,720 --> 03:10:09,560
If that's gonna happen the Dick Machine is better right

11713
03:10:09,560 --> 03:10:11,960
If that's gonna happen the Dick Machine is better right

11714
03:10:11,960 --> 03:10:14,090
Hurts more than any punishment

11715
03:10:14,090 --> 03:10:16,630
And you broke it, look

11716
03:10:15,410 --> 03:10:16,270
It's completely broken

11717
03:10:16,700 --> 03:10:17,830
This calls for the Dick Machine right

11718
03:10:17,830 --> 03:10:20,230
Here's a new one

11719
03:10:20,230 --> 03:10:22,800

They found it laying around nearby

An old school desk has appeared!

11723
03:10:29,270 --> 03:10:31,080
If you break the next table it's over you know

11724
03:10:31,080 --> 03:10:34,810
If you break the next table it's over you know

11725
03:10:31,940 --> 03:10:33,430
Here we go

11726

Don't break it

11727
03:10:34,010 --> 03:10:34,810
Don't break the table

Thank you very much

12317
03:19:52,770 --> 03:19:54,670
Thank you very much

12318
03:19:55,010 --> 03:19:58,510
What do you wanna eat? Let's start there

12319
03:19:58,510 --> 03:19:59,810
The Wet Tissue SLAP is going to fall on whose face?

12320
03:19:59,810 --> 03:20:02,180
The Wet Tissue SLAP is going to fall on whose face?

12321
03:20:02,180 --> 03:20:03,380
If you vote for Matsumoto raise your hands

12322
03:20:03,380 --> 03:20:06,180
If you vote for Matsumoto raise your hands

12323
03:20:06,370 --> 03:20:10,160
After this, Matsumoto SLAP!

12324
03:20:10,920 --> 03:20:14,830
You're really dunking them huh?

12325
03:20:13,450 --> 03:20:14,760
Properly

12326
03:20:16,090 --> 03:20:18,560
They're tissues so

12327
03:20:16,900 --> 03:20:18,250
Ok, let's go!

12328
03:20:18,580 --> 03:20:21,600
Wet Tissue SLAP!!

12329
03:20:19,920 --> 03:20:21,300
I can only do this if the tissue is wet

12330
03:20:23,610 --> 03:20:25,520
Please relax!

12331
03:20:26,430 --> 03:20:27,500
Once again!

12332
03:20:27,630 --> 03:20:28,520
Okay, okay

12333
03:20:29,270 --> 03:20:30,180
Good, good!

12334
03:20:35,140 --> 03:20:38,650
And with that, the 7th Generation team wins!!

12335
03:20:36,080 --> 03:20:37,060
7th Generation team wins!!

12336
03:20:36,280 --> 03:20:40,520
7th Generation team wins!!

12337
03:20:42,180 --> 03:20:44,030
It went on beautifully

12338
03:20:48,830 --> 03:20:55,130
I'll definitely tell Okamoto about this

12339
03:20:48,830 --> 03:20:55,130
T/N: Okamoto refers to the current Yoshimoto Agency President and CEO, the agency all of the comedians here work for

12340
03:20:55,300 --> 03:21:01,070
13 hours in

12341
03:20:56,050 --> 03:21:01,070
After the battle, the five finally return to their room

12342
03:21:01,350 --> 03:21:05,880
Hotel basement hallway

12343
03:21:01,390 --> 03:21:05,880
Hotel basement hallway

12344
03:21:02,060 --> 03:21:04,890
Not knowing what awaits them...

12345
03:21:08,880 --> 03:21:09,650
Oh look at this!!

12346
03:21:09,650 --> 03:21:11,520
Oh look at this!!

12347
03:21:11,520 --> 03:21:14,620
The contents of all drawers have been reset

12348
03:21:13,120 --> 03:21:16,420
Have been reset

12349
03:21:13,120 --> 03:21:16,420
The contents of all drawers

12350
03:21:15,150 --> 03:21:17,150
Same pattern again

12351
03:21:17,290 --> 03:21:19,490
They always make us do this more than once

12352
03:21:22,730 --> 03:21:24,180
I'm tired

12353
03:21:29,600 --> 03:21:31,240
Are you opening yours already?

12354
03:21:29,920 --> 03:21:31,240
Are we?

12355
03:21:31,240 --> 03:21:32,220
Please wait a sec

12356
03:21:32,220 --> 03:21:33,270
You're starting already

12357
03:21:33,270 --> 03:21:34,640
There is this letter in mine

12358
03:21:33,270 --> 03:21:37,340
Mysterious envelope

12359
03:21:34,890 --> 03:21:36,890
So Matsumoto gets the letter?

12360
03:21:36,970 --> 03:21:38,970
He hasn't checked the other drawers

12361
03:21:37,610 --> 03:21:38,890
I don't know

12362
03:21:38,960 --> 03:21:39,740
Oh is that so

12363
03:21:39,240 --> 03:21:39,740
Yes

12364
03:21:42,200 --> 03:21:42,810
A letter!

12365
03:21:42,810 --> 03:21:45,980
How about you, Hosei?

12366
03:21:43,280 --> 03:21:44,330
There was a letter

12367
03:21:43,810 --> 03:21:45,130
Shall I open mine?

12368
03:21:44,330 --> 03:21:46,130
Who knows what's in yours, Hosei

12369
03:21:46,380 --> 03:21:47,950
There's nothing written on the envelope

12370
03:21:47,670 --> 03:21:48,820
Hold on for a second

12371
03:21:48,850 --> 03:21:49,190
Nothing

12372
03:21:49,190 --> 03:21:50,360
Nothing

12373
03:21:50,360 --> 03:21:51,900
Nothing

12374
03:21:51,900 --> 03:21:52,660
Nothing!!

12375
03:21:53,220 --> 03:21:54,770
How about you, Tanaka?

12376
03:21:56,590 --> 03:21:58,030
Right from the get-go

12377
03:21:58,030 --> 03:22:02,530
Mysterious DVD

12378
03:21:58,550 --> 03:21:59,560
It's a DVD!

12379
03:22:05,170 --> 03:22:07,170
You were laughing your heart out

12380
03:22:10,810 --> 03:22:13,740
Let's be proper about that

12381
03:22:12,460 --> 03:22:13,740
Please stop with that

12382
03:22:12,890 --> 03:22:14,890
Hold on...

12383
03:22:14,880 --> 03:22:16,430
Let's

12384
03:22:15,310 --> 03:22:17,020
I said this

12385
03:22:17,020 --> 03:22:19,480
Let's stay on guard guys

12386
03:22:17,650 --> 03:22:19,650
I just said this

12387
03:22:20,450 --> 03:22:22,150
Let's watch the DVD

12388
03:22:21,150 --> 03:22:22,790
This is troublesome

12389
03:22:22,790 --> 03:22:25,320
This DVD thing again

12390
03:22:25,690 --> 03:22:27,360
In the last turn

12391
03:22:28,460 --> 03:22:30,310
Were your drawers empty, Hosei?

12392
03:22:30,630 --> 03:22:32,360
The queen of tele-shopping

12393
03:22:33,200 --> 03:22:34,860

Walking around the city, when all of a sudden

12420
03:23:25,280 --> 03:23:28,490
A Thai kick to your butt. Has this ever happened to you?

12421
03:23:29,790 --> 03:23:30,940
It must have, right?

12422

Never happened to me

12423

Oh yeah, he should

12453
03:24:32,950 --> 03:24:34,950
Wait a minute

12454
03:24:35,050 --> 03:24:36,290
Do I have to do this?

12455
03:24:37,560 --> 03:24:39,760
Well, the DVD was in your drawer

12456
03:24:39,760 --> 03:24:43,900
But they didn't say it's for me

12457
03:24:41,060 --> 03:24:42,470
They didn't, yeah

12458
03:24:43,900 --> 03:24:44,660
Regardless of that, you should give them a call

12459

Yeah, you should

12461
03:24:46,800 --> 03:24:48,800
Why do I have to do this?

12462
03:24:48,130 --> 03:24:50,130
Because you got the DVD

12463
03:24:48,970 --> 03:24:52,300
You should call them and ask them, because I might buy one, too

12464
03:24:51,600 --> 03:24:52,400
Right

12465
03:24:53,760 --> 03:24:56,210
Not many among us can buy that, right?

12466
03:24:54,470 --> 03:24:56,210

12467
03:24:56,210 --> 03:24:56,960
Right

12468
03:24:56,610 --> 03:24:57,340
Yes

12469
03:24:56,990 --> 03:24:59,840
It's not 25K but 250K, which is a lot of money

12470
03:24:59,840 --> 03:25:02,610
You have to borrow quite a lot

12471

Pushy, weren't you?

12490
03:25:43,100 --> 03:25:44,320
I realize that

12491
03:25:44,320 --> 03:25:45,320
In the past I've had a very bad experience with tele-shopping

12492
03:25:45,320 --> 03:25:47,460
In the past I've had a very bad experience with tele-shopping

12493
03:25:47,720 --> 03:25:49,720
That is beside the point

12494
03:25:49,830 --> 03:25:51,760
I'm from Ahn Mika Shopping Channel

12495
03:25:51,760 --> 03:25:53,810
This here is for Mr. Tanaka

12496
03:25:51,760 --> 03:25:56,730
Ahn Mika Shopping Channel

12497
03:25:51,760 --> 03:25:56,730
Super quick delivery

12498
03:25:53,800 --> 03:25:54,930
Quick!

12499
03:25:54,710 --> 03:25:56,150
Excuse me, sir

12500
03:25:55,200 --> 03:25:56,480
That was quick!

12501
03:25:56,300 --> 03:25:57,430
That was quick!

12502
03:25:57,440 --> 03:26:00,970
Could you please sign here

12503
03:26:01,540 --> 03:26:03,010
That must be the suit

12504
03:26:03,010 --> 03:26:07,850
Signing the loan agreement

12505
03:26:03,370 --> 03:26:04,820
Should be it

12506
03:26:04,470 --> 03:26:06,470
He gets the loan with this

12507
03:26:08,110 --> 03:26:10,180
That was quick!!

12508
03:26:09,350 --> 03:26:11,350
Thank you very much, sir

12509
03:26:10,830 --> 03:26:14,780
Same day shipping. So convenient these days. Thank you very much

12510
03:26:11,350 --> 03:26:12,720
Thank you very much

12511
03:26:14,950 --> 03:26:15,690
Tanaka, why don't you

12512
03:26:15,690 --> 03:26:17,520
Go and change into it in the dressing room

12513
03:26:16,950 --> 03:26:18,350
Ok

12514
03:26:17,970 --> 03:26:19,970
The Ahn Mika shopping channel is so good

12515
03:26:20,020 --> 03:26:21,290
Ahn Mika shopping channel

12516
03:26:21,290 --> 03:26:24,030
It looks good

12517
03:26:22,010 --> 03:26:24,010
Looks like a proper item

12518
03:26:22,880 --> 03:26:24,030
Unlike last time

12519
03:26:23,830 --> 03:26:24,930
Right?

12520
03:26:24,510 --> 03:26:25,130
Yes

12521
03:26:24,950 --> 03:26:26,550
Is it heavy?

12522
03:26:25,130 --> 03:26:27,060
And it's a suit by Ahn Mika

12523
03:26:26,560 --> 03:26:27,710
I'm counting on this

12524
03:26:27,830 --> 03:26:30,700
You can wear that suit to the casino as well

12525
03:26:30,570 --> 03:26:32,420
Yes, exactly

12526
03:26:31,100 --> 03:26:32,420
That's true

12527
03:26:32,420 --> 03:26:34,400
That would actually be nice

12528
03:26:36,970 --> 03:26:40,040
I want a lip balm

12529
03:26:38,840 --> 03:26:40,840
The lip balm is...

12530
03:26:40,040 --> 03:26:42,580
It's 1000 Heipo

12531
03:26:42,580 --> 03:26:43,980
Buy me one!!

12532
03:26:45,620 --> 03:26:46,550
What!?

12533
03:26:46,550 --> 03:26:50,190
Hahahaa

12534
03:26:50,820 --> 03:26:52,820
I completely forgot we're on the show

12535
03:26:52,860 --> 03:26:54,660
Looked like it

12536
03:27:00,900 --> 03:27:02,050
Please go ahead

12537
03:27:01,510 --> 03:27:04,250
Such a waste

12538
03:27:07,400 --> 03:27:08,560
Oh!

12539
03:27:08,570 --> 03:27:09,660
What happened?

12540
03:27:09,660 --> 03:27:11,660
What happened?

12541
03:27:10,140 --> 03:27:11,910
Matsumoto, hold on

12542
03:27:11,910 --> 03:27:13,810
Can you please show me your left hand?

12543
03:27:13,810 --> 03:27:15,330
That's your right hand, please show me the left

12544
03:27:21,090 --> 03:27:24,620
Please put the money in

12545
03:27:26,720 --> 03:27:28,680
So that's what happened

12546
03:27:27,670 --> 03:27:29,530
Hamada, can you tell him not do such things

12547
03:27:32,100 --> 03:27:33,350
That is not right

12548
03:27:33,330 --> 03:27:34,430
That has a bad influence on kids watching

12549
03:27:34,430 --> 03:27:36,900
The cheekiness of you for doubting someone's actions

12550
03:27:36,900 --> 03:27:40,970
The cheekiness of you for doubting someone's actions

12551
03:27:38,990 --> 03:27:40,990
It would be better to be proper about that

12552
03:27:41,570 --> 03:27:44,210
Sorry to have kept you waiting

12553
03:27:44,210 --> 03:27:46,110
Finally

12554
03:27:46,710 --> 03:27:49,350
Sorry to have kept you waiting

12555
03:27:49,350 --> 03:27:50,880
Finally

12556
03:27:51,460 --> 03:27:52,580
Thai kick protection suit

12557
03:27:53,320 --> 03:27:55,690
Looks good!!

12558
03:27:54,720 --> 03:27:56,720
Looks good!!

12559
03:27:55,690 --> 03:27:57,090
Looks perfectly fine

12560
03:27:57,090 --> 03:27:58,690
Why the long face?

12561
03:27:58,690 --> 03:28:00,930
This is not good

12562
03:27:59,790 --> 03:28:00,790
Why?

12563
03:28:00,870 --> 03:28:02,510
It makes your shoulders look good

12564
03:28:01,860 --> 03:28:03,830
Looks good compared to anything in the past

12565
03:28:10,370 --> 03:28:13,100
This is awful

12566
03:28:14,100 --> 03:28:15,990
This is awful!

12567
03:28:15,570 --> 03:28:17,460
This is awful!

12568
03:28:17,880 --> 03:28:26,280
Half suit with a missing back

12569
03:28:17,880 --> 03:28:26,280
Thai Kick protection suit

12570
03:28:21,160 --> 03:28:23,160
How will this protect you from a Thai Kick?

12571
03:28:23,180 --> 03:28:25,180
I do not understand

12572
03:28:24,660 --> 03:28:26,280
The package said so, right?

12573
03:28:26,280 --> 03:28:27,380
This is awful

12574
03:28:27,390 --> 03:28:28,420
If you laugh you still get smacked

12575
03:28:28,420 --> 03:28:30,420
If you laugh you still get smacked

12576
03:28:29,570 --> 03:28:30,940
Yeah, of course

12577
03:28:30,720 --> 03:28:32,020
Oh, that's true

12578
03:28:31,450 --> 03:28:32,740
That's right

12579
03:28:33,420 --> 03:28:35,890
Thai Kick protection may work because of the mystic powers

12580
03:28:35,890 --> 03:28:38,100
Thai Kick protection may work because of the mystic powers

12581
03:28:38,390 --> 03:28:40,140
Isn't this really awful?

12582
03:28:40,110 --> 03:28:40,770
It is!

12583
03:28:40,770 --> 03:28:44,240
Even his back is completely uncovered

12584
03:28:42,530 --> 03:28:44,240
Also, look at this

12585
03:28:44,240 --> 03:28:46,040
This terrible wedgie

12586
03:28:46,040 --> 03:28:48,170
Your butt is completely out there

12587
03:28:50,860 --> 03:28:52,260
Don't describe it like that

12588
03:28:53,040 --> 03:28:54,960
No way

12589
03:28:54,960 --> 03:28:57,080
Don't describe it like that

12590
03:28:57,310 --> 03:28:57,980
Hold on, I'm scared!!

12591
03:28:57,980 --> 03:29:00,380
Hold on, I'm scared!!

12592
03:29:01,620 --> 03:29:01,740
AAAAA

12593
03:29:01,740 --> 03:29:01,750
AAAAA

12594
03:29:01,750 --> 03:29:01,780
AAAAA

12595
03:29:01,770 --> 03:29:01,790
AAAAA

12596
03:29:01,790 --> 03:29:01,800
AAAAA

12597
03:29:01,800 --> 03:29:01,820
AAAAA

12598
03:29:01,820 --> 03:29:04,420
AAAAA

12599
03:29:07,690 --> 03:29:09,040
This is terrible

12600
03:29:16,220 --> 03:29:18,220
This is terrible

12601
03:29:16,800 --> 03:29:19,450
This is terrible

12602
03:29:18,230 --> 03:29:20,230
This is terrible, Tanaka

12603
03:29:22,010 --> 03:29:23,610
Hosei's way of describing it was not cool!!

12604
03:29:22,360 --> 03:29:24,360
This is terrible

12605
03:29:23,610 --> 03:29:24,980
Hosei's way of describing it was not cool!!

12606
03:29:24,370 --> 03:29:27,290
I've never had it wedged in that much

12607
03:29:27,940 --> 03:29:29,010
You sounded like a child actor reading their lines

12608
03:29:29,010 --> 03:29:33,320
You sounded like a child actor reading their lines

12609
03:29:34,830 --> 03:29:36,540
Please don't add on things like that

12610
03:29:36,540 --> 03:29:38,140
Please don't add on things like that

12611
03:29:38,140 --> 03:29:40,540
Please hold on, this seriously hurts. This seriously

12612
03:29:38,650 --> 03:29:40,190
That's true

12613
03:29:40,310 --> 03:29:41,510
If he keeps adding on things

12614
03:29:41,740 --> 03:29:44,660
AAAAA

12615
03:29:46,380 --> 03:29:48,050
This is terrible

12616
03:29:47,180 --> 03:29:48,310
This is horrible

12617
03:29:53,700 --> 03:29:56,870
Naked butt

12618
03:29:56,870 --> 03:29:57,710
Plus, you still have a big loan to repay

12619
03:29:57,710 --> 03:30:00,240
Plus, you still have a big loan to repay

12620
03:30:00,430 --> 03:30:01,750
You can see the marks right there

12621
03:30:01,750 --> 03:30:03,980
Look and see if he's all right

12622
03:30:03,550 --> 03:30:04,760
This is painful

12623
03:30:04,450 --> 03:30:07,530
It's still better than a Thai Kick

12624
03:30:07,820 --> 03:30:09,500
Look at the swelling

12625
03:30:09,020 --> 03:30:10,490
That's what happens

12626
03:30:10,490 --> 03:30:12,920
Hosei was like this, too. It was even worse

12627
03:30:11,340 --> 03:30:12,920
True

12628
03:30:13,040 --> 03:30:13,990
Really!?

12629
03:30:14,040 --> 03:30:15,940
You can see the marks

12630
03:30:15,120 --> 03:30:17,120
He's only had two hits

12631
03:30:15,990 --> 03:30:18,330
You can see precisely two lines for two hits

12632
03:30:18,340 --> 03:30:19,750
You can see the marks

12633
03:30:19,110 --> 03:30:21,110
You can see the lines

12634
03:30:20,980 --> 03:30:22,100
This is...

12635
03:30:22,100 --> 03:30:23,210
Rough, huh?

12636
03:30:23,400 --> 03:30:24,600
Hold on a sec

12637
03:30:24,600 --> 03:30:26,670
This is quite bad

12638
03:30:26,900 --> 03:30:29,340
Oh, as time passes, it gets more...

12639
03:30:29,340 --> 03:30:30,820
Ahh, you're right

12640
03:30:31,040 --> 03:30:34,880
Don't make it twitch!!

12641
03:30:34,390 --> 03:30:35,860
Why is only the right cheek twitching?

12642
03:30:40,880 --> 03:30:42,170
You laughed again

12643
03:30:42,420 --> 03:30:45,540
Tanaka, don't laugh!

12644
03:30:45,200 --> 03:30:46,640
It's because you guys said all sorts of stuff

12645
03:30:47,250 --> 03:30:48,490
AAAHHHH

12646
03:30:48,490 --> 03:30:51,060
This guy is good!

12647
03:30:54,030 --> 03:30:55,860
That assassin is amazing

12648
03:30:57,330 --> 03:30:58,420
That was a hard hit

12649
03:30:58,420 --> 03:30:59,300
Yep

12650
03:31:00,520 --> 03:31:01,700
You really

12651
03:31:01,700 --> 03:31:04,570
Ought to rub something on it

12652
03:31:02,820 --> 03:31:04,570
That's true

12653
03:31:05,370 --> 03:31:07,580
Rub chapstick or something on it

12654
03:31:07,580 --> 03:31:08,880
Chapstick won't work

12655
03:31:07,580 --> 03:31:13,050
Get first aid for the time being

12656
03:31:08,880 --> 03:31:10,330
You gotta rub something on it, like chapstick

12657
03:31:10,330 --> 03:31:11,780
Chapstick won't work, I'm telling you

12658
03:31:10,950 --> 03:31:13,060
Something like vaseline right?

12659
03:31:12,230 --> 03:31:13,410
Yes

12660
03:31:14,280 --> 03:31:15,420
I just bought some so I'll do it for you

12661
03:31:15,420 --> 03:31:17,280
I just bought some so I'll do it for you

12662
03:31:17,280 --> 03:31:18,650
Seriously

12663
03:31:19,600 --> 03:31:21,260
We did that thing last time, didn't we?

12664
03:31:21,260 --> 03:31:22,420
We cooled it

12665
03:31:22,420 --> 03:31:24,940
Down with some ice

12666
03:31:22,660 --> 03:31:24,940
Cooling it down with ice is the best way

12667
03:31:24,940 --> 03:31:27,080
We have ice but...

12668
03:31:27,080 --> 03:31:28,610
Ice costs money right?

12669
03:31:28,610 --> 03:31:30,930
Ice isn't written on the list

12670
03:31:30,930 --> 03:31:33,230
Or will the ice hurt, like the last time?

12671
03:31:33,230 --> 03:31:36,040
Ha ha ha

12672
03:31:36,890 --> 03:31:38,760
What happened? Why are you laughing?

12673
03:31:38,160 --> 03:31:38,760
What happened?

12674
03:31:38,760 --> 03:31:39,810
It's fine, just lie down

12675
03:31:39,810 --> 03:31:40,740
Just stay like that

12676
03:31:40,740 --> 03:31:42,710
Lying down?

12677
03:31:43,940 --> 03:31:49,050
AAAHHHHHHH!!

12678
03:31:51,850 --> 03:31:53,100
Watermelon smashing

12679
03:31:53,750 --> 03:31:56,560
That was watermelon smashing

12680
03:32:00,460 --> 03:32:03,500
We saw a remarkable face!!

12681
03:32:03,900 --> 03:32:07,500
Aaah my ass...

12682
03:32:04,980 --> 03:32:07,500
Stay strong, Tanaka. He'll rub chapstick on for you

12683
03:32:08,140 --> 03:32:08,700
I'm gonna cool you down, I'm gonna put it on

12684
03:32:08,700 --> 03:32:11,310
I'm gonna cool you down, I'm gonna put it on

12685
03:32:10,990 --> 03:32:12,560
Sorry, sorry

12686
03:32:11,610 --> 03:32:12,990
That's good

12687
03:32:13,470 --> 03:32:14,680
That's the love between a duo

12688
03:32:13,470 --> 03:32:15,580
We're in this together

12689
03:32:15,910 --> 03:32:18,710
It hurts!!

12690
03:32:16,510 --> 03:32:17,730
It hurts?

12691
03:32:17,730 --> 03:32:19,010
It hurts?

12692
03:32:19,850 --> 03:32:21,430
What was hurting?

12693
03:32:23,320 --> 03:32:26,390
It was too cold

12694
03:32:23,320 --> 03:32:26,390
You can see the round pattern from the heat

12695
03:32:26,850 --> 03:32:29,020
Put some chapstick on

12696
03:32:27,920 --> 03:32:29,920
This can't be used for lips anymore

12697
03:32:29,920 --> 03:32:30,830
Sorry about that

12698
03:32:30,830 --> 03:32:31,840
Yeah

12699
03:32:32,630 --> 03:32:33,590
This'll make it a bit better, with the menthol

12700
03:32:33,590 --> 03:32:34,830
This'll make it a bit better, with the menthol

12701
03:32:34,830 --> 03:32:36,100
Really?

12702
03:32:36,480 --> 03:32:37,400
Thank you

12703
03:32:37,400 --> 03:32:38,270
You don't need it cooled down?

12704
03:32:38,270 --> 03:32:39,620
No, I'll be alright

12705
03:32:42,600 --> 03:32:44,070
This had nothing to do with avoiding Thai Kicks

12706
03:32:44,070 --> 03:32:46,670
This had nothing to do with avoiding Thai Kicks

12707
03:32:44,670 --> 03:32:46,170
Yep, unrelated

12708
03:32:46,170 --> 03:32:46,670
That's true

12709
03:32:46,670 --> 03:32:47,680
Secret

12710
03:32:47,680 --> 03:32:50,340
Secret

12711
03:32:48,040 --> 03:32:49,330
What?

12712
03:32:50,340 --> 03:32:51,350
What's going on?

12713
03:32:51,350 --> 03:32:53,450
Can you take a look?

12714
03:32:53,060 --> 03:32:54,550
I was getting the deeper parts

12715
03:32:54,550 --> 03:32:55,230
How is it?

12716
03:32:55,230 --> 03:32:56,670
What's going on? Could you...

12717
03:32:56,670 --> 03:32:58,020
Whats going on?

12718
03:32:58,020 --> 03:32:59,400
Hamada came over for you

12719
03:33:12,370 --> 03:33:15,170
AAAAHHHH!!

12720
03:33:15,170 --> 03:33:17,040
It's much better now

12721
03:33:17,040 --> 03:33:17,940
Do you mind?

12722
03:33:17,940 --> 03:33:19,010
Thanks

12723
03:33:19,010 --> 03:33:20,170
No worries

12724
03:33:22,230 --> 03:33:24,110
How's that?

12725
03:33:24,110 --> 03:33:26,210
Wait, hurry up and take it out!

12726
03:33:26,250 --> 03:33:26,980
If you're gonna take it out, do it quick!!

12727
03:33:26,980 --> 03:33:28,820
If you're gonna take it out, do it quick!!

12728
03:33:34,840 --> 03:33:37,880
I can't see the tip anymore, now

12729
03:33:43,080 --> 03:33:47,430
AAAAHHHHH!!

12730
03:33:45,500 --> 03:33:47,200
This is hell

12731
03:33:47,770 --> 03:33:51,270
This is hell

12732
03:33:49,320 --> 03:33:50,390
For real

12733
03:33:51,270 --> 03:33:53,760
Seriously, it's really rough

12734
03:33:53,760 --> 03:33:55,110
He's making a super scary face

12735
03:33:56,540 --> 03:34:00,050
It's cause Endo didn't take it out quickly

12736
03:33:57,530 --> 03:33:59,610
Sorry, sorry about that

12737
03:33:59,610 --> 03:34:00,700
Sorry, Tanaka

12738
03:34:01,120 --> 03:34:02,120
Will you be able to sit at ZIP?

12739
03:34:02,120 --> 03:34:04,350
T/N: ZIP is a morning TV show that Tanaka is on

12740
03:34:02,120 --> 03:34:04,350
Will you be able to sit at ZIP?

12741
03:34:04,350 --> 03:34:06,650
I can't in this condition

12742
03:34:06,650 --> 03:34:09,290
Is it ZIP or LIP, I can't even tell

12743
03:34:13,460 --> 03:34:16,380
Stay stronger, Tanaka. Don't laugh there

12744
03:34:16,380 --> 03:34:18,980
Please don't say that

12745
03:34:18,980 --> 03:34:20,840
Gotta stay strong, Tanaka

12746
03:34:20,840 --> 03:34:22,190
I'm sweating

12747
03:34:22,420 --> 03:34:24,240
I'm pouring sweat

12748
03:34:24,390 --> 03:34:24,520
AAAAHHHHH!!

12749
03:34:24,520 --> 03:34:24,540

AAAAHHHHH!!

12755
03:34:27,760 --> 03:34:29,060
You can do it

12756
03:34:30,380 --> 03:34:32,010
I'm taking it out

12757
03:34:31,460 --> 03:34:32,930
Please

12758
03:34:32,930 --> 03:34:34,970
One, two, three!

12759
03:34:34,970 --> 03:34:36,120
Three

12760
03:34:36,420 --> 03:34:37,640
Is there any poop on it?

12761
03:34:39,140 --> 03:34:40,290
No it's fine

12762
03:34:40,290 --> 03:34:41,590
Smell it Endo

12763
03:34:41,590 --> 03:34:42,960
Smell it Endo

12764
03:34:42,040 --> 03:34:42,960
Me?

12765
03:34:44,060 --> 03:34:45,110
It's alright, it's alright

12766
03:34:45,110 --> 03:34:45,990
Smell it

12767
03:34:45,990 --> 03:34:47,210
It won't smell

12768
03:34:47,950 --> 03:34:49,080
Come on

12769
03:34:49,510 --> 03:34:51,380
Cough

12770
03:34:55,400 --> 03:34:57,720
What the hell are you doing?

12771
03:34:57,720 --> 03:34:59,020
Yeah

12772
03:34:59,020 --> 03:35:00,140
Enough of this!

12773
03:35:00,140 --> 03:35:01,640
What is this?!

12774
03:35:05,280 --> 03:35:07,510
AHHHH it hurts! It hurts!

12775
03:35:09,450 --> 03:35:11,390
Let's wrap this one up!!

12776
03:35:11,390 --> 03:35:12,250
Any more of this is impossible, Tanaka

12777
03:35:12,250 --> 03:35:14,320
Any more of this is impossible, Tanaka

12778

That freaking hurt

12779

Tanaka, that's enough

12780
03:35:17,160 --> 03:35:20,390

Heipo Central Bank Employees

12816

Earlier, there was a loan made to Tanaka Naoki

12817
03:36:28,130 --> 03:36:33,800
We've been informed that the 250,000 Heipo loan

12818
03:36:30,760 --> 03:36:33,800
Was used by a fraudulent organization

12819
03:36:33,800 --> 03:36:35,770
We've come to collect the loan money

12822
03:36:39,370 --> 03:36:42,430
The 250,000 Heipo loan

12823
03:36:42,430 --> 03:36:44,980
Do you still have it with you?

12824
03:36:45,550 --> 03:36:45,880
No, I don't have it

12825
03:36:45,880 --> 03:36:48,180
No, I don't have it

12826
03:36:48,720 --> 03:36:52,990
You do understand that we made a loan to you?

12827
03:36:53,450 --> 03:36:56,110
You signed your name right here!

12828
03:36:56,110 --> 03:36:59,090
In other words, you have to return that money right now

12829
03:36:59,930 --> 03:37:03,700
Or else we will be incurring these losses!!

12830
03:37:03,700 --> 03:37:05,000
Even if you have to borrow it,

12831
03:37:05,000 --> 03:37:08,340
Pay us back right now!!

12832
03:37:06,980 --> 03:37:08,340
No, umm

12833
03:37:08,340 --> 03:37:09,570
I signed it but I don't have the money...

12834
03:37:09,570 --> 03:37:10,970
I signed it but I don't have the money...

12835
03:37:10,970 --> 03:37:14,010
So I asked for a loan, but no money came here

12836
03:37:15,010 --> 03:37:15,940
Not a penny

12837
03:37:17,880 --> 03:37:19,210
Assistant director Hanazawa what should we do?

12838
03:37:19,210 --> 03:37:20,580
Assistant director Hanazawa what should we do?

12839
03:37:33,840 --> 03:37:37,530
If someone does you, you do them back

12840
03:37:37,530 --> 03:37:38,800
It's Thai-back!!

12841
03:37:38,800 --> 03:37:43,040
It's Thai-back!!

12842
03:37:46,710 --> 03:37:47,610
There was no evasion

12843
03:37:47,610 --> 03:37:49,230

So it was a lie, right?

12847
03:37:52,150 --> 03:37:53,100
There was no evasion, and...

12848
03:37:53,100 --> 03:37:54,180
And that suit, also

12849
03:37:54,480 --> 03:37:56,580
Has no effectiveness

12850
03:37:56,580 --> 03:37:57,950
I've taken a beating on my bare ass

12851
03:37:57,950 --> 03:37:59,620
I've taken a beating on my bare ass

12852
03:37:59,620 --> 03:38:02,290
And there's still a Thai kick?

12853
03:38:00,770 --> 03:38:02,290
Well, it's a different kind of pain

12854
03:38:03,420 --> 03:38:05,790
Make it quick and change clothes

12855
03:38:06,330 --> 03:38:07,110
This is really happening!?

12856
03:38:07,110 --> 03:38:07,760
Gotta finish this

12857
03:38:07,760 --> 03:38:09,830
Seriously, with these!?

12858
03:38:09,830 --> 03:38:10,900
Wait, seriously

12859
03:38:10,900 --> 03:38:12,930
It's not stil in there, right?

12860
03:38:12,930 --> 03:38:14,120
We took the chapstick out, right?

12861
03:38:14,120 --> 03:38:16,220
Yeah, yeah, seriously!? Seriously!?

12862
03:38:16,720 --> 03:38:16,850
OWW!!

12863
03:38:16,850 --> 03:38:16,870
OWW!!

12864
03:38:16,870 --> 03:38:16,890
OWW!!

12865
03:38:16,890 --> 03:38:16,900
OWW!!

12866
03:38:16,900 --> 03:38:16,920
OWW!!

12867
03:38:16,920 --> 03:38:16,940
OWW!!

12868
03:38:16,940 --> 03:38:20,810
OWW!!

12869
03:38:21,490 --> 03:38:21,630
OWW!!

12870
03:38:21,630 --> 03:38:21,640
OWW!!

12871
03:38:21,640 --> 03:38:21,660
OWW!!

12872
03:38:21,640 --> 03:38:21,680
OWW!!

12873
03:38:21,680 --> 03:38:21,690
OWW!!

12874
03:38:21,690 --> 03:38:21,710
OWW!!

12875
03:38:21,710 --> 03:38:24,510
OWW!!

12876
03:38:38,390 --> 03:38:40,330
Tanaka has had so much done to him

12877
03:38:42,330 --> 03:38:44,430
His last moments huh

12878
03:38:44,430 --> 03:38:45,370
I really feel

12879
03:38:45,370 --> 03:38:47,700
Sorry for Tanaka

12880
03:38:48,090 --> 03:38:50,190
This was ridiculous

12881
03:38:50,190 --> 03:38:51,110
And chaotic, wasn't it?

12882
03:38:51,110 --> 03:38:52,370
Yeah it was, so

12883
03:38:52,370 --> 03:38:54,240
Just get changed, then

12884
03:38:59,010 --> 03:39:03,050
This year's Thai kick was serious

12885
03:39:03,050 --> 03:39:05,890
They did it up until last year

12886
03:39:04,320 --> 03:39:05,890
Yeah this one was serious

12887
03:39:06,090 --> 03:39:13,790
15 hours have passed

12888
03:39:06,600 --> 03:39:13,730
Next, the five go to watch a taping of an audition show at the hotel

12889
03:39:09,320 --> 03:39:13,790
Talent Show Taping

12890
03:39:13,990 --> 03:39:17,260
This super popular show in Las Vegas is...

12891
03:39:21,750 --> 03:39:22,370
This way

12892
03:39:22,370 --> 03:39:24,000
We keep coming back here

12893
03:39:24,090 --> 03:39:30,480
Good Talent recording studio

12894
03:39:24,090 --> 03:39:30,480
Talent Show

12895
03:39:24,920 --> 03:39:26,360
This is the recording studio

12896
03:39:26,360 --> 03:39:27,880
Of the super popular talent show

12897
03:39:27,880 --> 03:39:30,810
Good Talent

12898
03:39:30,810 --> 03:39:34,180
That show where you can become a star

12899
03:39:32,750 --> 03:39:34,180
I like that show

12900
03:39:34,450 --> 03:39:35,580
Hosei, you're excited right?

12901
03:39:34,930 --> 03:39:35,630
Yes?

12902
03:39:35,580 --> 03:39:37,180
Hosei, you're excited right?

12903
03:39:37,180 --> 03:39:38,890
I like that show

12904
03:39:39,220 --> 03:39:40,350
Why did he suddenly just ask one person?

12905
03:39:40,350 --> 03:39:42,660
Why did he suddenly just ask one person?

12906
03:39:41,190 --> 03:39:42,660
Maybe he suddenly remembered his line?

12907
03:39:42,660 --> 03:39:44,730
These are special front row seats

12908
03:39:44,730 --> 03:39:49,900
You'll get to learn

12909
03:39:46,190 --> 03:39:49,900
From the home of entertainment

12910
03:39:59,060 --> 03:40:02,280
The show begins!

12911
03:40:00,770 --> 03:40:03,710
Ike Nwala

12912
03:40:02,280 --> 03:40:03,710
Looks like a real show

12913
03:40:03,710 --> 03:40:06,610
The talent show where your life changes overnight

12914
03:40:08,920 --> 03:40:13,790
First an introduction of the judges

12915
03:40:11,700 --> 03:40:13,790
Come On!

12916
03:40:14,320 --> 03:40:16,960
Judge

12917
03:40:14,320 --> 03:40:16,960
Max

12918
03:40:19,890 --> 03:40:22,660
Jennifer

12919
03:40:19,890 --> 03:40:22,660
Judge

12920
03:40:22,810 --> 03:40:23,730
And

12921
03:40:23,730 --> 03:40:26,400
The head judge is...

12922
03:40:28,540 --> 03:40:30,340
Mr. Ishiba

12923
03:40:28,600 --> 03:40:33,670
Head Judge

12924
03:40:28,600 --> 03:40:33,670
Shigeru Ishiba

12925
03:40:31,910 --> 03:40:33,120
Ishiba!

12926
03:40:33,670 --> 03:40:36,380
Really!?

12927
03:40:38,650 --> 03:40:40,900
This is amazing

12928
03:40:39,480 --> 03:40:48,990
Head Judge is former Minister of Defense, Shigeru Ishiba

12929
03:40:41,580 --> 03:40:43,480
This cannot be real

12930
03:40:45,290 --> 03:40:46,370
Mr. Ishiba

12931
03:40:46,370 --> 03:40:47,290
This is crazy

12932
03:40:47,290 --> 03:40:48,510
You don't see him in such shows

12933
03:40:48,510 --> 03:40:49,510
Exactly

12934
03:40:49,720 --> 03:40:50,710
You're right

12935
03:40:50,820 --> 03:40:53,260
The Head Judge is Ishiba

12936
03:40:51,960 --> 03:40:53,260
Ishiba

12937
03:40:53,290 --> 03:40:54,650
What are your thoughts?

12938
03:40:54,900 --> 03:40:59,870
Why I am the Head Judge,

12939
03:40:57,310 --> 03:40:59,870
I do not completely understand

12940
03:40:59,880 --> 03:41:04,740
But since I'm doing this, I'll ensure strict fairness

12941
03:41:04,740 --> 03:41:06,540
Our citizens' comprehension and empathy

12942
03:41:06,790 --> 03:41:08,280
Will be my main goals

12943
03:41:08,490 --> 03:41:12,610
I ensure I will do my sincere best

12944
03:41:09,510 --> 03:41:12,610
Hold on, this is way too serious

12945
03:41:13,950 --> 03:41:15,680
This has nothing to do with citizens...

12946
03:41:15,680 --> 03:41:19,820
He's speaking as if he's doing a political speech...

12947
03:41:15,720 --> 03:41:17,480
Citizens?

12948
03:41:21,490 --> 03:41:22,620
Okay

12949
03:41:22,620 --> 03:41:24,160
The first performer is this one!!

12950
03:41:24,160 --> 03:41:26,160
The first performer is this one!!

12951
03:41:29,460 --> 03:41:33,400
Performer

12952
03:41:29,460 --> 03:41:33,400
T/N: Tetsuya Takeda is a famous actor and singer, most well known for playing the main character in Kinpachi Sensei.

12953
03:41:29,460 --> 03:41:33,400
Tetsuya Takeda

12954
03:41:31,880 --> 03:41:32,480
Hello

12955
03:41:33,530 --> 03:41:34,270
What? I did not recognize him for a second there

12956
03:41:34,270 --> 03:41:36,240
What? I did not recognize him for a second there

12957
03:41:37,840 --> 03:41:38,470
I didn't recognize him

12958
03:41:38,470 --> 03:41:39,770
I didn't recognize him either

12959
03:41:41,840 --> 03:41:43,980
Let's start with your name

12960
03:41:43,980 --> 03:41:45,150
My name is Tetsuya Takeda

12961
03:41:45,150 --> 03:41:49,020
What will you be performing for us today?

12962
03:41:47,560 --> 03:41:49,020
I'll go with

12963
03:41:49,020 --> 03:41:51,080
My forte, singing...

12964
03:41:51,340 --> 03:41:52,770
Okay, all the best

12965
03:41:52,770 --> 03:41:53,600
Thank you

12966
03:41:53,690 --> 03:41:56,420
What's with his hairstyle

12967
03:41:58,010 --> 03:42:04,700
Perfume (Kosui)

12968
03:41:58,010 --> 03:42:04,700
T/N: This song, "Kosui," is originally by an artist called Eito that has a really unique music video which has inspired many comedians to do their own version of it.

12969
03:41:58,010 --> 03:42:04,700
Tetsuya Takeda

12970
03:41:59,430 --> 03:42:00,930
I get it now

12971
03:42:00,930 --> 03:42:02,900
I get it now

12972
03:42:04,720 --> 03:42:12,410
Out of the blue, you text me in the middle of the night asking if I'm free

12973
03:42:12,410 --> 03:42:20,150
A very Takeda-esque version of the song Perfume

12974
03:42:12,740 --> 03:42:20,150
I haven't seen you in three years, I wonder how you're doing

12975
03:42:20,150 --> 03:42:28,360
At that time, it felt as if we could do anything

12976
03:42:23,100 --> 03:42:24,480
The music video is something like this

12977
03:42:28,360 --> 03:42:36,430
T/N: Hisako Manda was a former Miss Universe contestant. She also appeared in the Enthusiastic Teacher Batsu, doing a monologue in the nurse's office.

12978
03:42:28,360 --> 03:42:36,430
The dancer is Hisako Manda

12979
03:42:28,510 --> 03:42:30,310
The two of us

12980
03:42:30,310 --> 03:42:35,510
Took a lot of pictures at the sea

12981
03:42:36,430 --> 03:42:43,700
But look at me now, I'm a piece of garbage now

12982
03:42:43,700 --> 03:42:51,980
Even when I hurt other people and make them cry, I do not feel anything

12983
03:42:43,790 --> 03:42:45,240
It's too Takeda-esque

12984
03:42:51,980 --> 03:43:00,050
It's not as if I want you back, but when you're next to me, it takes me back

12985
03:43:00,050 --> 03:43:07,790
It's that Dolce & Gabbana perfume you wear that's at fault here

12986
03:43:07,790 --> 03:43:15,540
Don't get me wrong, I could fall for you again, you're a wonderful person

12987
03:43:15,540 --> 03:43:24,540
But we'd repeat the same pattern as before and I'd get dumped again

12988
03:43:29,150 --> 03:43:31,080
It's like Sumiko Nishioka

12989
03:43:29,150 --> 03:43:31,080
T/N: Sumiko Nishioka is a comedian who does skits as a dominatrix and does the splits in her routine.

12990
03:43:32,000 --> 03:43:33,700
I hate this

12991
03:43:38,020 --> 03:43:40,290
That was a great stage performance

12992
03:43:40,830 --> 03:43:42,660
Ishiba

12993
03:43:42,660 --> 03:43:44,200
What did you think of it?

12994
03:43:44,710 --> 03:43:49,000
Miss Manda put herself on the line to save Mr. Takeda

12995
03:43:49,040 --> 03:43:52,270
This left a deep impression on me

12996
03:43:52,720 --> 03:43:55,480
It was like watching the Aegis Warship

12997
03:43:52,720 --> 03:43:55,480
T/N: He's referring to warships that use the Aegis System. Remember, he was the former Minister of Defense.

12998
03:43:55,780 --> 03:43:58,750
Really setting aside your own interests in order to protect

12999
03:43:58,760 --> 03:44:00,450
This sort of spirit

13000
03:44:00,460 --> 03:44:02,930
From Japan's national security perspective

13001
03:44:03,020 --> 03:44:04,650
Is extremely important

13002
03:44:04,700 --> 03:44:07,090
This truly

13003
03:44:05,640 --> 03:44:07,090
Left a deep impression on me

13004
03:44:07,090 --> 03:44:09,490
Thank you very much

13005
03:44:13,590 --> 03:44:15,800
All of them have gone crazy

13006
03:44:18,280 --> 03:44:22,400
The next performance is coming right up!

13007
03:44:24,120 --> 03:44:25,970
Hello

13008
03:44:25,870 --> 03:44:29,610
Nakayama Kinni-kun

13009
03:44:25,870 --> 03:44:29,610
Performer

13010
03:44:25,870 --> 03:44:29,610
T/N: Nakayama Kinni-kun is a comedian that does comedy that focuses on his muscles.

I'm Nakayama Kinni-kun

13012
03:44:30,040 --> 03:44:32,560
I've come back to the USA again

13013
03:44:32,560 --> 03:44:36,680
Today, I'll show you

13014
03:44:33,950 --> 03:44:36,680
My upgraded performance

13015
03:44:36,680 --> 03:44:38,620
I'm sure it's same as always

13016
03:44:38,800 --> 03:44:40,170
Music... Start!

13017
03:44:40,170 --> 03:44:41,510
Music... Start!

13018
03:44:41,710 --> 03:44:49,200
Nakayama Kinni-kun

13019
03:44:53,630 --> 03:44:55,470
Same as his old one

13020
03:44:54,700 --> 03:44:55,440
I've seen this before

13021
03:44:58,190 --> 03:44:59,990
Mr. Ishiba is watching intently

13022
03:45:00,390 --> 03:45:01,530
Maybe it's his first time

13023
03:45:01,830 --> 03:45:03,390
He's watching intently

13024
03:45:09,350 --> 03:45:14,350
T/N: Yuki Koyanagi is a Japanese pop singer. She sang the American and Japanese National Anthems for the 2006 World Baseball Classic in Tokyo.

13025
03:45:09,350 --> 03:45:14,350
Yuki Koyanagi's live rendition of It's My Life

13026
03:45:17,720 --> 03:45:20,290
What should I focus on?

13027
03:45:47,490 --> 03:45:49,790
Yeah!!

13028
03:45:54,530 --> 03:45:55,750
Really!

13029
03:45:55,750 --> 03:45:56,760
Miss Koyanagi

13030
03:45:56,960 --> 03:45:57,830
Ouch

13031
03:45:59,430 --> 03:46:00,900
She's a really good singer

13032
03:45:59,870 --> 03:46:02,570
Did not expect a live song

13033
03:46:02,570 --> 03:46:04,640
Mr. Ishiba

13034
03:46:04,700 --> 03:46:05,570
What did you think of it?

13035
03:46:05,970 --> 03:46:11,680
I think this is exactly what the

13036
03:46:08,330 --> 03:46:11,680
Japan-USA Alliance should be like

13037
03:46:11,780 --> 03:46:16,280
America acts as the spear and Japan acts as the shield

13038
03:46:16,320 --> 03:46:18,950
This is what the Japan-USA Alliance is, however...

13039
03:46:18,990 --> 03:46:20,690
What's important is

13040
03:46:20,750 --> 03:46:24,420
The benefits of the Alliance

13041
03:46:22,260 --> 03:46:24,420
Should not get to be enjoyed by only one of the two parties

13042
03:46:24,420 --> 03:46:27,330
Both sides really need to think about one another

13043
03:46:27,730 --> 03:46:31,060
It's not right for only one party to benefit from it

13044
03:46:31,100 --> 03:46:33,500
That was the perfect embodiment of it

13045
03:46:33,530 --> 03:46:36,470
That is what I think this performance was all about

13046
03:46:36,940 --> 03:46:41,040
The exuberance you displayed is what really touched me

13047
03:46:41,070 --> 03:46:43,380
I pray that both of you thrive and flourish

13048
03:46:43,390 --> 03:46:47,750
That is what I would like to sincerely

13049
03:46:45,010 --> 03:46:47,750
Convey to both of you today

13050
03:46:50,250 --> 03:46:51,100
That was a very packed comment

13051
03:46:51,100 --> 03:46:52,140
I don't get what he's saying

13052
03:46:52,690 --> 03:46:53,550
All his comments sound so political...

13053
03:46:53,550 --> 03:46:57,860
All his comments sound so political...

13054
03:46:58,160 --> 03:47:00,730
The next performance is coming right up!

13055
03:47:00,730 --> 03:47:02,200
The next performance is coming right up!

13056
03:47:17,410 --> 03:47:21,010

03:47:19,100 --> 03:47:19,850
He's here

13060
03:47:21,750 --> 03:47:23,320
He's here finally

13061
03:47:23,650 --> 03:47:25,520
What is he up to

13062
03:47:31,960 --> 03:47:36,300
I've come back after a long time

13063
03:47:39,080 --> 03:47:40,470
Until recently I was locked up

13064
03:47:40,470 --> 03:47:43,040
Until recently I was locked up

13065
03:47:43,040 --> 03:47:44,940
Until recently I was locked up

13066
03:47:44,940 --> 03:47:46,740
Oh he was released

13067
03:47:47,040 --> 03:47:48,640
Anyway to be able to come back

13068
03:47:48,640 --> 03:47:50,310
Anyway to be able to come back

13069
03:47:50,310 --> 03:47:52,780
Anyway to be able to come back

13070
03:47:52,780 --> 03:47:56,480
And be able to sing in front of everyone

13071
03:47:56,480 --> 03:47:57,020
Anti-social

13072
03:47:56,480 --> 03:48:01,370
T/N: Anti-social is "hansha" while gratitude is "kansha".

13073
03:47:57,020 --> 03:48:01,370
Anti-social

13074
03:47:58,490 --> 03:48:01,370
-- no --

13075
03:47:59,420 --> 03:47:59,720
gratitude

13076
03:47:59,720 --> 03:48:01,370
gratitude

13077
03:48:01,370 --> 03:48:03,520
That's a weird mistake to make

13078
03:48:03,660 --> 03:48:05,060
Here's a song I want you all to hear

13079
03:48:05,060 --> 03:48:06,990
Here's a song I want you all to hear

13080
03:48:06,990 --> 03:48:09,930
I'm sure you know this song

13081
03:48:09,930 --> 03:48:13,700
Dandelion

13082
03:48:11,970 --> 03:48:13,700
That song doesn't suit him at all

13083
03:48:13,920 --> 03:48:17,640
Dandelion (Tanpopo)

13084
03:48:17,640 --> 03:48:22,380
Yellow dandelions blooming on the embankment

13085
03:48:22,380 --> 03:48:27,980
Are looking up at me and swaying

13086
03:48:27,980 --> 03:48:32,920
That's such a wonderful thing

13087
03:48:32,920 --> 03:48:35,690
Swaying swaying (swaying swaying)

13088
03:48:35,690 --> 03:48:38,020

Swaying around

13092
03:48:43,230 --> 03:48:44,400
He's such a nice guy

13093
03:48:43,530 --> 03:48:46,100
Tura tura (tura tura)

13094
03:48:46,080 --> 03:48:48,570
Tura tura tura tura ra ra

13095
03:48:48,570 --> 03:48:50,070
Kanpachi, Kannana

13096
03:48:48,570 --> 03:48:53,710
T/N: Kanpachi and Kannana are streets in Tokyo.

13097
03:48:50,070 --> 03:48:51,520
Kanpachi, Kannana

13098
03:48:51,520 --> 03:48:53,710
Are almost always crowded

13099
03:48:53,710 --> 03:48:56,640
Swaying swaying (swaying swaying)

13100
03:48:56,730 --> 03:49:02,480

He's such a nice guy

13107
03:49:25,090 --> 03:49:26,320
He's completely changed

13108
03:49:29,290 --> 03:49:29,930
Ouch

13109
03:49:29,930 --> 03:49:30,380
Ouch

13110
03:49:33,180 --> 03:49:35,150
He's gone

13111
03:49:35,750 --> 03:49:37,250
That was wonderful

13112
03:49:37,250 --> 03:49:40,290
What did you think of it? Mr. Ishiba

13113
03:49:39,150 --> 03:49:40,290
Mr. Ishiba

13114
03:49:40,320 --> 03:49:44,360
Turning over a new leaf is always possible, I believe

13115
03:49:44,820 --> 03:49:47,460
What is one's true heart in life?

13116
03:49:47,480 --> 03:49:49,760
That is what was on display in his performance

13117
03:49:49,810 --> 03:49:53,700
I was truly moved by that

13118
03:50:01,570 --> 03:50:03,610
The next performance is coming right up!

13119
03:50:03,610 --> 03:50:04,640

13123
03:50:11,700 --> 03:50:12,790
Really?

13124
03:50:14,390 --> 03:50:15,820
This will not be good

13125
03:50:19,180 --> 03:50:20,680
I've been hit a lot today

13126
03:50:20,680 --> 03:50:23,500
What are they up to?

13127
03:50:26,800 --> 03:50:28,430
With Yoga, the toxins in your body, the toxins in your mind, shall be gone

13128

Presenting the Yoga breathing method to remove the body's toxins

13135
03:50:41,060 --> 03:50:43,180
Wow

13136
03:51:03,600 --> 03:51:04,370
All right

13137
03:51:04,970 --> 03:51:07,010
The toxins in your body,

13138
03:51:07,010 --> 03:51:09,510
And the toxins in your mind, can be removed by this

13139
03:51:09,940 --> 03:51:11,410
Today in this hall, we have

13140

Many people who must have their toxins removed

13142
03:51:17,150 --> 03:51:20,190
You guys

13143
03:51:22,570 --> 03:51:23,760
Whoa!

13144
03:51:27,930 --> 03:51:32,600
Fujimoto Toshifumi

13145
03:51:27,930 --> 03:51:32,600
Kinoshita Takayuki

13146
03:51:30,650 --> 03:51:32,600
You must be kidding me

13147
03:51:35,740 --> 03:51:40,570
Especially that one over there

13148
03:51:38,940 --> 03:51:40,570
Let's get rid of your toxins

13149
03:51:40,570 --> 03:51:41,770
Come here

13150
03:51:42,180 --> 03:51:46,150
Lumps of toxins

13151
03:51:44,460 --> 03:51:46,150
Well yeah

13152
03:51:46,650 --> 03:51:51,350
Let's let out the toxins by speaking them out as words

13153
03:51:51,600 --> 03:51:54,550
Let's purify ourselves

13154
03:51:55,090 --> 03:51:57,520
Ever since that happened, I feel afraid whenever I see tapioca

13155
03:51:57,520 --> 03:52:03,060
Ever since that happened, I feel afraid whenever I see tapioca

13156
03:51:57,520 --> 03:52:03,060
T/N: In 2019, Fujimoto's then-wife got in a public dispute with a tapioca milk tea shop. Later, other scandals about her became public. Fujimoto and his wife later divorced

13157
03:52:03,800 --> 03:52:05,300
Never ever will I throw plastic bottles again

03:52:05,300 --> 03:52:08,170
Never ever will I throw plastic bottles again

Now,

13162
03:52:21,280 --> 03:52:24,080
This is the final purification ritual

13163
03:52:24,080 --> 03:52:25,620
If you purify your mind, you won't feel any heat

13164
03:52:25,620 --> 03:52:28,170
If you purify your mind, you won't feel any heat

13165
03:52:28,170 --> 03:52:30,760
That's what purification is

13166
03:52:30,760 --> 03:52:32,930
You won't feel any heat...

13167
03:52:32,930 --> 03:52:34,890
You won't feel anything...

13168
03:52:36,110 --> 03:52:37,050
Not hot at all

13169
03:52:38,030 --> 03:52:40,000
You don't feel anything...

13170
03:52:42,000 --> 03:52:44,270
You won't feel any heat, at all

13171
03:52:44,770 --> 03:52:44,790

Enough already

13193
03:52:51,030 --> 03:52:53,500
He really felt the heat

13194
03:52:52,560 --> 03:52:53,500
Yes

13195
03:52:53,900 --> 03:52:55,370
It's hot, right?

13196
03:53:00,320 --> 03:53:00,340
It's hot!!

13197
03:53:00,340 --> 03:53:00,350

03:53:11,010 --> 03:53:12,170

Hot hot

13232
03:53:12,320 --> 03:53:12,330
Hot hot

13233
03:53:12,330 --> 03:53:12,350

13234
03:53:12,350 --> 03:53:12,370
Hot hot

13235
03:53:12,370 --> 03:53:12,380
Hot hot

13236
03:53:12,380 --> 03:53:12,380

Hot hot

13246
03:53:13,770 --> 03:53:15,340
It's hot, right?

13247
03:53:25,040 --> 03:53:26,010
All right

13248
03:53:26,010 --> 03:53:29,020
That was the best night ever, wasn't it?

13249
03:53:33,990 --> 03:53:35,120
That surprised me

13250
03:53:35,490 --> 03:53:38,020
Everyone, that was an amazing show, wasn't it?

13251
03:53:38,310 --> 03:53:39,310
Let's go

13252
03:53:39,830 --> 03:53:41,790
Amazing? Was it really?

13253
03:53:42,310 --> 03:53:49,800
16 hours have passed

13254
03:53:44,750 --> 03:53:49,800
The sleepless town, Las Vegas, was still hustling and bustling

13255
03:53:50,500 --> 03:53:55,240
They have been called back to the casino again.
What awaits them this time?

13256
03:53:55,980 --> 03:53:57,710
Can't we just stay here the whole time?

13257
03:53:58,180 --> 03:54:01,880
The dealer will be here so please wait a bit

13258
03:54:01,880 --> 03:54:03,370
Wow

13259
03:54:04,350 --> 03:54:06,250
We haven't made any money at all

13260
03:54:06,250 --> 03:54:07,740
True

13261
03:54:06,750 --> 03:54:07,740
Oh yeah

13262
03:54:08,120 --> 03:54:10,960
Everyone, sorry for making you wait

13263
03:54:10,960 --> 03:54:12,490
Sorry for making you wait

13264
03:54:12,490 --> 03:54:14,660
Sorry for making you wait

13265
03:54:25,200 --> 03:54:27,310
You did that bit to your heart's content last year

13266
03:54:25,670 --> 03:54:28,710
Kusanagi Tsuyoshi

13267
03:54:25,670 --> 03:54:28,710
Showed up as Director Muranishi last year

13268
03:54:26,570 --> 03:54:28,270
I might've made you wait for too long

13269
03:54:28,270 --> 03:54:30,110
We weren't even waiting for you

13270
03:54:30,110 --> 03:54:31,080
I thought this year I would be going as Demon Slayer but...

13271
03:54:31,080 --> 03:54:33,610
I thought this year I would be going as Demon Slayer but...

13272
03:54:33,610 --> 03:54:35,180
When I got to the dressing room there were briefs and a camera

13273
03:54:35,180 --> 03:54:38,820
What is the meaning of this?

13274
03:54:36,520 --> 03:54:38,820
I don't know...

13275
03:54:39,250 --> 03:54:41,690
I don't know anything about the items they gave you

13276
03:54:41,690 --> 03:54:43,690
Well yeah, Demon Slayer is really...

13277
03:54:43,690 --> 03:54:45,560
It's quite... yeah

13278
03:54:47,390 --> 03:54:51,230
Today, I will capture everyone's

13279
03:54:49,000 --> 03:54:51,230
Expressions of their bare instincts

13280
03:54:51,230 --> 03:54:52,830
With my camera

13281
03:54:52,850 --> 03:54:54,930
Matsumoto, that's nice

13282
03:54:54,970 --> 03:54:56,900
Hamada, that's nice

13283
03:54:57,800 --> 03:54:59,010
Let's do the traditional conch shell questions

13284
03:54:59,010 --> 03:55:01,040
Let's do the traditional conch shell questions

13285
03:55:00,120 --> 03:55:01,040
Here we go

13286
03:55:01,040 --> 03:55:02,090
Here's for Matsumoto

13287
03:55:01,040 --> 03:55:07,610
The traditional director's
conch shell questions

13288
03:55:02,540 --> 03:55:03,010
Here's for Hamada

13289
03:55:03,010 --> 03:55:04,140
We did this last year, too

13290
03:55:04,140 --> 03:55:07,610
If it's YES blow twice, if it's NO blow once

13291
03:55:07,610 --> 03:55:08,780
Let's start with

13292
03:55:07,780 --> 03:55:23,010
m 0 949.5 l 1924.5 949.5 1924.5 1021.5 0 1021.5

13293
03:55:07,780 --> 03:55:23,030
Answering the director's question:

13294
03:55:07,780 --> 03:55:23,030
NO blow once

13295
03:55:07,780 --> 03:55:23,030
YES blow twice

13296
03:55:08,780 --> 03:55:11,850
With you, wearing the nice vintage clothes

13297
03:55:11,850 --> 03:55:21,560
Q. Do you have a pair of jeans that you could give to Kusanagi?

13298
03:55:19,140 --> 03:55:21,560
Yes, yes!

13299
03:55:21,560 --> 03:55:23,030
That's NICE

13300
03:55:23,530 --> 03:55:25,410
That's nice

13301
03:55:34,310 --> 03:55:36,580
He's just being happy

13302
03:55:34,310 --> 03:56:04,300
Answering the director's question:

13303
03:55:34,310 --> 03:56:04,300
NO blow once

13304
03:55:34,310 --> 03:56:04,300
YES blow twice

13305
03:55:34,310 --> 03:56:04,300
m 0 949.5 l 1924.5 949.5 1924.5 1021.5 0 1021.5

13306
03:55:37,160 --> 03:55:38,380
Next...

13307
03:55:38,380 --> 03:55:44,050
You, who said last year that you go for drinks

13308
03:55:41,200 --> 03:55:44,050
With Nakai twice a month

13309
03:55:44,050 --> 03:55:46,550
For the year 2021...

13310
03:55:46,550 --> 03:55:47,950
Nakai, Matsumoto, Kusanagi

13311
03:55:47,950 --> 03:55:49,220
Nakai, Matsumoto, Kusanagi

13312
03:55:49,220 --> 03:55:50,290
Nakai, Matsumoto, Kusanagi

13313
03:55:50,290 --> 03:55:58,360
Q. Do you think [Nakai & Matsumoto & Kusanagi] can go for drinks together?

13314
03:55:58,430 --> 03:55:59,580
We can!

13315
03:56:00,680 --> 03:56:04,300
That's NICE

13316
03:56:07,310 --> 03:56:12,950
The director wants to go for drinks with all three of them!

13317
03:56:12,950 --> 03:56:16,220
Those were some cheerful instincts you gave me

13318
03:56:16,220 --> 03:56:19,520
To tell you why I'm dressed like this today

13319
03:56:19,520 --> 03:56:23,890
It's because I brought a buddy who has a similar persona

13320
03:56:22,510 --> 03:56:23,890
All right, come on in

13321
03:56:25,730 --> 03:56:28,130
Sorry for making you all wait

13322
03:56:28,130 --> 03:56:31,030
Director Muranishi Touru

13323
03:56:28,130 --> 03:56:31,030
Similar persona as Kusanagi

13324
03:56:28,130 --> 03:56:32,970
T/N: Muranishi Touru is a famous director and producer of pornographic films

13325
03:56:33,120 --> 03:56:35,570
Sorry for making you wait

13326
03:56:33,120 --> 03:56:35,570
Sorry for making you wait

13327
03:56:35,590 --> 03:56:39,140
That's NICE

13328
03:56:35,590 --> 03:56:39,140
That's NICE

13329
03:56:38,320 --> 03:56:39,140
There it is, there it is

13330
03:56:41,270 --> 03:56:43,880
This is some reverse impersonation happening here

13331
03:56:47,180 --> 03:56:48,280
Wow

13332
03:56:48,410 --> 03:56:49,780
That's nice

13333
03:56:49,930 --> 03:56:52,120
That's nice

13334
03:56:51,030 --> 03:56:52,120
That's nice

13335
03:56:52,120 --> 03:56:55,820
Video shoot between director & director

13336
03:56:52,170 --> 03:56:53,100
That's nice

13337
03:56:53,050 --> 03:56:55,820
No, no

13338
03:56:53,120 --> 03:56:53,940
That's nice

13339
03:56:54,040 --> 03:56:54,990
Fantastic

13340
03:56:55,000 --> 03:56:55,890

13350
03:57:10,150 --> 03:57:11,970
This is amazing

13351
03:57:15,370 --> 03:57:16,280
Wow

13352
03:57:16,280 --> 03:57:18,840
Ahh~ caught me off guard

13353
03:57:18,090 --> 03:57:18,840
Director

13354
03:57:19,210 --> 03:57:20,910
We had a good shoot here

13355
03:57:21,050 --> 03:57:21,850
That's nice

13356
03:57:21,850 --> 03:57:22,680
That's nice

13357
03:57:22,680 --> 03:57:24,050

For today,

13364
03:57:30,990 --> 03:57:32,360
We are not done yet

13365
03:57:32,930 --> 03:57:35,560
I have another buddy coming

13366
03:57:34,430 --> 03:57:35,560
Come on in!

13367
03:57:37,060 --> 03:57:38,830
Sorry for making you all wait

13368
03:57:38,830 --> 03:57:42,440

Saito Shinji

13370
03:57:39,570 --> 03:57:42,440
Or rather, I might've made you wait for too long

13371
03:57:42,440 --> 03:57:45,240
The order is all wrong

13372
03:57:45,240 --> 03:57:47,870
Me, who came out after the real one, too weak

13373
03:57:47,870 --> 03:57:50,640
Me, who came out after the real one, too weak

13374
03:57:48,760 --> 03:57:49,880
That's weak

13375
03:57:49,880 --> 03:57:50,640
It's weak

13376
03:57:50,640 --> 03:57:56,020
Director Saito is too weak since he came out after the real director...

13377
03:57:50,980 --> 03:57:52,030
That's weak

13378
03:57:52,030 --> 03:57:52,860
It's quite weak

13379
03:57:53,210 --> 03:57:56,020
Me, who came out after the real one, it's weak

13380
03:57:56,020 --> 03:57:59,820
I fully acknowledge that this is quite weak

13381
03:57:58,480 --> 03:57:59,820
Oh, so he knows

13382
03:57:59,820 --> 03:58:02,790
But I cannot leave just like this

13383
03:58:02,140 --> 03:58:02,790
Of course

13384
03:58:03,110 --> 03:58:04,310
That's nice

13385
03:58:06,210 --> 03:58:07,540
That's nice

13386
03:58:09,000 --> 03:58:10,350
So now

13387
03:58:09,000 --> 03:58:15,470
A stretch that doesn't do anything

13388
03:58:09,000 --> 03:58:15,470
Hot topic on the internet this year

13389
03:58:10,350 --> 03:58:15,470
I will show you an exercise that you can do easily at home

13390
03:58:15,470 --> 03:58:16,270
Matsumoto, let's try stretching

13391
03:58:16,270 --> 03:58:18,040
Matsumoto, let's try stretching

13392
03:58:18,600 --> 03:58:19,490
Come come

13393
03:58:19,470 --> 03:58:22,540
I have a good feeling about this

13394
03:58:20,790 --> 03:58:21,640
It's good

13395
03:58:21,640 --> 03:58:22,540
I have a good feeling about this

13396
03:58:22,680 --> 03:58:24,210
Music, action

13397
03:58:28,980 --> 03:58:32,390
That's NICE

13398
03:58:29,720 --> 03:58:32,390
That's NICE

13399
03:58:30,470 --> 03:58:31,100
That's NICE

13400
03:58:31,100 --> 03:58:31,780
Nice indeed

13401
03:58:31,780 --> 03:58:32,390
Matsumoto, that's nice

13402
03:58:32,620 --> 03:58:33,500
That's nice

13403
03:58:34,590 --> 03:58:35,400
That's nice

13404
03:58:35,400 --> 03:58:36,360
That's nice

13405
03:58:36,360 --> 03:58:37,010
That's good

13406
03:58:37,010 --> 03:58:37,810
That's nice

13407
03:58:37,810 --> 03:58:38,620
That's good

13408
03:58:38,620 --> 03:58:39,760
That's nice

13409
03:58:38,940 --> 03:58:39,760
That's good

13410
03:58:39,760 --> 03:58:40,310
That's nice

13411
03:58:40,310 --> 03:58:41,760
That's Jackal

13412
03:58:41,030 --> 03:58:41,760
That's Jackal

13413
03:58:42,350 --> 03:58:43,110
That's good

13414
03:58:43,110 --> 03:58:44,000
That's nice

13415
03:58:44,000 --> 03:58:46,500
Sorry for making you wait

13416
03:58:46,500 --> 03:58:49,800
That's nice

13417
03:58:49,950 --> 03:58:51,020
That's nice

13418
03:58:51,020 --> 03:58:53,370
Too nice, gorgeous, fantastic

13419
03:58:58,180 --> 03:58:59,510
What a mess

13420
03:58:59,510 --> 03:59:00,760
This is quite chaotic

13421
03:58:59,510 --> 03:59:04,520
A messed up Jackal video shoot

13422
03:59:03,770 --> 03:59:04,520
Okay

13423
03:59:04,520 --> 03:59:05,820
We got good footage, that's a wrap

13424
03:59:05,820 --> 03:59:09,020
We got good footage, that's a wrap

13425
03:59:07,100 --> 03:59:09,020
That's NICE

13426
03:59:07,100 --> 03:59:09,020
That's NICE

13427
03:59:09,510 --> 03:59:10,890
That's nice

13428
03:59:10,890 --> 03:59:13,030
That's too weak

13429
03:59:11,860 --> 03:59:13,030
That's too weak

13430
03:59:13,030 --> 03:59:13,990
The order was...

13431
03:59:13,990 --> 03:59:15,110
Yeah, he came after the real one

13432
03:59:15,110 --> 03:59:16,380
I guess they did that on purpose

13433
03:59:16,380 --> 03:59:17,300
Everyone

13434
03:59:17,760 --> 03:59:20,130
The dealers here are full of character

13435
03:59:20,130 --> 03:59:22,540
Let's head out, then

13436
03:59:21,170 --> 03:59:22,540
We haven't done anything yet

13437
03:59:23,100 --> 03:59:25,640
Those were the dealers

13438
03:59:24,640 --> 03:59:25,640
Those were dealers?

13439
03:59:25,760 --> 03:59:27,040
They didn't do anything

13440
03:59:27,460 --> 03:59:29,180
We didn't play anything

13441
03:59:29,940 --> 03:59:31,080
I didn't get to make a single bet...

13442
03:59:31,080 --> 03:59:34,750
I didn't get to make a single bet...

13443
03:59:35,380 --> 03:59:43,290
Waiting Room

13444
03:59:43,610 --> 03:59:45,620
Oh good, no new drawers

13445
03:59:50,860 --> 03:59:54,770
(with funny eyeglasses)

13446
03:59:50,860 --> 03:59:54,770
Fujioka Hiroshi mask

13447
03:59:50,860 --> 03:59:54,770
m 1221 208.5 l 1729.5 208.5 1729.5 381 1221 381

13448
03:59:51,510 --> 03:59:54,600
That's a good one. It's funny

13449
03:59:54,600 --> 03:59:56,250
It looks like someone

13450
03:59:58,250 --> 04:00:01,140
That one was the best

13451
04:00:06,210 --> 04:00:08,680
What a big head

13452
04:00:08,680 --> 04:00:09,120
Okay

13453
04:00:21,100 --> 04:00:24,340
This is the best

13454
04:00:22,270 --> 04:00:24,340
That face is crazy

13455
04:00:24,970 --> 04:00:28,540
He's a projectionist

13456
04:00:28,540 --> 04:00:30,260
A projectionist

13457
04:00:31,780 --> 04:00:34,250
This is really amazing

13458
04:00:33,130 --> 04:00:34,250
A projectionist

13459
04:00:34,720 --> 04:00:36,180
He really looks like one

13460
04:00:38,350 --> 04:00:39,070
Hello

13461
04:00:39,070 --> 04:00:40,690
A projectionist he says

13462
04:00:41,580 --> 04:00:43,320
Amazing isn't it

13463
04:00:43,640 --> 04:00:44,950
The chin is something else

13464
04:00:44,950 --> 04:00:46,730
If you look at him close up, it's so funny

13465
04:00:46,730 --> 04:00:47,960
This is great

13466
04:00:47,960 --> 04:00:50,460
The fact that his face is huge

13467
04:00:51,000 --> 04:00:51,780
It's something huh?

13468
04:00:51,780 --> 04:00:53,080
It's super

13469
04:00:52,290 --> 04:00:53,080
Yep

13470
04:00:53,080 --> 04:00:56,940
It's really amazing

13471
04:00:56,940 --> 04:00:59,520
Taking it off is scary too

13472
04:00:59,520 --> 04:01:00,640
Yep

13473
04:01:01,380 --> 04:01:02,980
It's great

13474
04:01:02,980 --> 04:01:07,050
Tanaka you haven't done it yet

13475
04:01:04,600 --> 04:01:05,610
That's right

13476
04:01:05,610 --> 04:01:07,050
Let me give it a go

13477
04:01:07,580 --> 04:01:08,870
There's probably I can use

13478
04:01:15,020 --> 04:01:16,110
Ah it's a key isn't it

13479
04:01:16,110 --> 04:01:16,990
Yep a key

13480
04:01:16,990 --> 04:01:19,090
There's been quite a few keys

13481
04:01:19,090 --> 04:01:20,530
Number 10

13482
04:01:20,530 --> 04:01:23,560
Key number 10

13483
04:01:24,660 --> 04:01:25,800
What is it?

13484
04:01:25,800 --> 04:01:27,570
What is this?

13485
04:01:27,570 --> 04:01:28,320
Here it is

13486
04:01:28,940 --> 04:01:32,340
Helium gas

13487
04:01:29,310 --> 04:01:31,080
Helium gas

13488
04:01:33,610 --> 04:01:35,780
It doesn't really work on me

13489
04:01:35,780 --> 04:01:38,010
Same

13490
04:01:36,240 --> 04:01:38,010
It doesn't work on you?

13491
04:01:38,010 --> 04:01:40,030
I'm the type it doesn't work well on

13492
04:01:40,030 --> 04:01:42,600
Me too, it doesn't work well on me

13493
04:01:50,470 --> 04:01:52,060
Is it okay to suck it in like that?

13494
04:01:54,430 --> 04:01:56,600
What time did you go to bed yesterday?

13495
04:01:56,600 --> 04:01:59,400
Yesterday at 11...

13496
04:01:56,600 --> 04:01:59,400
Yesterday at 11...

13497
04:01:59,400 --> 04:02:01,870
Your voice really changed

13498
04:02:02,850 --> 04:02:04,070
It changed!

13499
04:02:04,070 --> 04:02:06,370
Yeah it really changed

13500
04:02:11,770 --> 04:02:13,580
It really changed

13501
04:02:14,530 --> 04:02:15,830
It really changed

13502
04:02:16,920 --> 04:02:20,050
Let's play shiritori

13503
04:02:16,920 --> 04:02:22,690
T/N: Shiritori is a Japanese game where each person takes a turn using the last letter of the previous word and use that as the first letter of the next word.

13504
04:02:18,020 --> 04:02:19,140
Okay

13505
04:02:20,050 --> 04:02:22,690
Let's go with Helium Shiritori

13506
04:02:22,690 --> 04:02:23,920
Hosei, you wanna go?

13507
04:02:23,920 --> 04:02:27,030
Hmm, go give it a shot, but I don't think it really works on me

13508
04:02:25,230 --> 04:02:30,060
Hosei VS Endo: Helium Shiritori

13509
04:02:27,190 --> 04:02:30,060
You have to suck it in deep

13510
04:02:34,080 --> 04:02:35,310
Come up with a starting word

13511
04:02:37,270 --> 04:02:39,240
Computer (konpyuta)

13512
04:02:39,240 --> 04:02:40,510
Rice field (tanbo)

13513
04:02:39,240 --> 04:02:40,510
Rice field (tanbo)

13514
04:02:42,480 --> 04:02:44,710
Dumdum (bonkura)

13515
04:02:42,480 --> 04:02:44,710
Dumdum (bonkura)

13516
04:02:47,310 --> 04:02:49,860
Hahahahahahahaha

13517
04:02:47,310 --> 04:02:49,860
Hahahahahahahaha

13518
04:02:50,520 --> 04:02:52,080
"Dumdum" doesn't work

13519
04:02:51,360 --> 04:02:54,070
Hahaha haa haa

13520
04:02:51,360 --> 04:02:54,070
Hahaha haa haa

13521
04:02:52,600 --> 04:02:54,240
What are you saying

13522
04:02:57,530 --> 04:02:59,230
What the hell is, "Dumdum"?

13523
04:03:00,340 --> 04:03:02,100
Ending with a "bo" is too hard!

13524
04:03:02,100 --> 04:03:03,430
There's all sorts

13525
04:03:03,430 --> 04:03:05,370
There's a lot

13526
04:03:05,370 --> 04:03:06,400
Your turn

13527
04:03:06,570 --> 04:03:08,800
We should hold back our laughs

13528
04:03:08,800 --> 04:03:11,150
Yeah let's try that

13529
04:03:08,800 --> 04:03:12,010
Matsumoto VS Endo: Helium Shiritori

13530
04:03:11,150 --> 04:03:12,010
Let's try

13531
04:03:16,610 --> 04:03:18,110
Omelette with rice (omuraisu)

13532
04:03:18,110 --> 04:03:19,780
Watermelon (suika)

13533
04:03:18,110 --> 04:03:19,780
Watermelon (suika)

13534
04:03:21,520 --> 04:03:23,120
Castella cake (kasutera)

13535
04:03:21,520 --> 04:03:23,120
Castella cake (kasutera)

13536
04:03:23,120 --> 04:03:23,950
Trumpet (rappa)

13537
04:03:23,120 --> 04:03:23,950
Trumpet (rappa)

13538
04:03:26,600 --> 04:03:29,460
Parisienne (parijennu)

13539
04:03:26,600 --> 04:03:29,460
Parisienne (parijennu)

13540
04:03:32,690 --> 04:03:33,920
What the hell man

13541
04:03:36,100 --> 04:03:37,180
Parisienne?

13542
04:03:37,180 --> 04:03:38,590
What the hell

13543
04:03:37,180 --> 04:03:39,940
Parisienne is a bit...

13544
04:03:39,940 --> 04:03:41,250
Isn't there more than that?

13545
04:03:43,480 --> 04:03:45,840
This is bad

13546
04:03:44,730 --> 04:03:46,550
It's a word, a word

13547
04:03:45,840 --> 04:03:47,030
What is this

13548
04:03:47,030 --> 04:03:48,380
It's about to run out

13549
04:03:48,380 --> 04:03:49,360
Really?

13550
04:03:49,360 --> 04:03:50,260
Yeah

13551
04:03:51,380 --> 04:03:53,710
Why are we doing this

13552
04:03:54,510 --> 04:03:55,300
Hold on

13553
04:03:55,300 --> 04:03:56,650
Seriously

13554
04:03:57,520 --> 04:03:59,150
Can you do another round with me?

13555
04:03:59,340 --> 04:04:00,140
For real

13556
04:04:01,360 --> 04:04:04,590
What kind of game?

13557
04:04:02,060 --> 04:04:03,120
Um

13558
04:04:04,590 --> 04:04:06,830
Let's go with Half Talent

13559
04:04:06,830 --> 04:04:09,000
Or whatever

13560
04:04:07,440 --> 04:04:09,000
That's fine

13561
04:04:09,000 --> 04:04:10,400
Let's all play

13562
04:04:10,400 --> 04:04:11,450
Alright

13563
04:04:10,870 --> 04:04:11,450
Okay

13564
04:04:12,100 --> 04:04:13,240
Let's bet some money

13565
04:04:14,330 --> 04:04:17,150
A thousand Heipo each?

13566
04:04:15,780 --> 04:04:17,150
Yeah

13567
04:04:18,010 --> 04:04:18,980

That's the topic

13573
04:04:28,920 --> 04:04:30,090
Made-up comedy duos?

13574
04:04:30,090 --> 04:04:33,090
Uh, for example,

13575
04:04:34,090 --> 04:04:36,320

Takeshi from Mame Daifuku

13595
04:05:33,310 --> 04:05:34,510
That was lame

13596
04:05:36,290 --> 04:05:38,770
T/N: It's hard to explain, but comedy duo names tend to use weird word combinations. Mame daifuku is just as-is without any creativity, plus Takeshi is a very common name.

13597
04:05:36,290 --> 04:05:38,770
Takeshi from Mame Daifuku is lame

13598
04:05:38,770 --> 04:05:39,880
It's impossible!

13599
04:05:40,480 --> 04:05:42,750

13600
04:05:43,240 --> 04:05:45,490

13601
04:05:45,490 --> 04:05:48,610

From T-bone steak too

I think it's wrong

13604
04:05:50,730 --> 04:05:52,030
Just a bit more...

13605
04:05:52,030 --> 04:05:54,870
Because it is exactly as-is

13606
04:05:53,550 --> 04:05:54,870
Yeah exactly

13607
04:05:55,900 --> 04:05:57,040

13608
04:05:57,300 --> 04:05:58,660

13618
04:06:26,570 --> 04:06:28,370
Transceiver is bad

13619
04:06:30,200 --> 04:06:33,010
Because there's a first and second, right?

13620
04:06:33,010 --> 04:06:34,880
What the hell

13621
04:06:37,310 --> 04:06:40,750
This is a waste

13622
04:06:40,750 --> 04:06:45,350
The ones with proper naming are being wasted

13623
04:06:45,350 --> 04:06:47,650
I definitely won't laugh

13624
04:06:47,650 --> 04:06:48,560
Yeah

13625
04:06:48,560 --> 04:06:49,020
Me too

13626
04:06:49,020 --> 04:06:50,420
It doesn't have to be interesting

13627
04:06:50,420 --> 04:06:52,130
Yeah, just something that seems like it would exist right?

13628
04:06:53,480 --> 04:06:55,230
Ok

13629
04:06:53,480 --> 04:06:55,230

04:07:50,900 --> 04:07:52,690

04:07:51,290 --> 04:07:52,690
Older brother!?

13650
04:07:52,690 --> 04:07:56,190
What? The older brother?

13651
04:07:53,450 --> 04:07:55,010
It doesn't fit at all

13652
04:07:55,010 --> 04:07:56,190
The older brother?

13653
04:08:00,170 --> 04:08:02,260
That's no good somehow

13654
04:08:02,860 --> 04:08:04,430
Whose win is it?

13655
04:08:04,700 --> 04:08:06,770
Anyone other than Hamada I think has the right to win

13659
04:08:14,810 --> 04:08:16,040
Okay you're out

13660
04:08:16,040 --> 04:08:16,980

Yeah, yeah, just now

13680
04:08:54,550 --> 04:08:56,280
Was an attempt to get us to laugh

13681
04:08:56,280 --> 04:08:58,450

Mountains from Mt. Rokko

13694
04:09:25,360 --> 04:09:26,380
No way, no way

13695
04:09:27,610 --> 04:09:29,220
Impossible

13696
04:09:31,100 --> 04:09:33,540
We can say this is my win right?

13697
04:09:33,540 --> 04:09:34,720
But

13698
04:09:34,720 --> 04:09:38,430
There's already is a Sylvester Stallone

That was strange

13701
04:09:38,430 --> 04:09:41,660

I only have 8,000

13716
04:10:02,930 --> 04:10:04,030
Seriously?

13717
04:10:03,580 --> 04:10:04,030
Yep

13718
04:10:05,150 --> 04:10:11,190

04:10:40,590 --> 04:10:41,840
Last game

13744
04:10:41,770 --> 04:10:42,090

I had an affair

13827

T/N: "APA Affair" refers to this actor's real life affair with a gravure idol at one of the APA Hotel locations.

13831

13832
04:12:45,890 --> 04:12:47,870
As I thought

13833
04:12:48,130 --> 04:12:49,910

During Science Lab, they ran into Succhi and Yoshida from Yoshimoto Shinkigeki

13873

Must be a power spot!

14105
04:18:17,540 --> 04:18:17,720
That's super stupid!!

14106
04:18:17,710 --> 04:18:17,790
Must be a power spot!

14107
04:18:17,720 --> 04:18:17,790
That's super stupid!!

14108
04:18:17,790 --> 04:18:17,940
Must be a power spot!

14109
04:18:17,790 --> 04:18:18,340
That's super stupid!!

14110
04:18:18,550 --> 04:18:20,340
What are you saying!?

14111
04:18:20,540 --> 04:18:24,710
Happy Boy

14112
04:18:20,540 --> 04:18:24,710
Happy Boy

14113
04:18:22,450 --> 04:18:24,110
Packed in too many things together

14114
04:18:22,610 --> 04:18:22,810
Wow!!

14115
04:18:22,610 --> 04:18:22,810
Wow!!

14116
04:18:22,810 --> 04:18:24,710
Wow!!

14117
04:18:22,810 --> 04:18:24,710
Wow!!

14118
04:18:25,580 --> 04:18:30,790
Kenichi Takito

14119
04:18:30,970 --> 04:18:31,100
Who made you laugh the most?

14120
04:18:31,100 --> 04:18:31,320
Who made you laugh the most?

14121
04:18:31,320 --> 04:18:31,440
Who made you laugh the most?

14122
04:18:31,440 --> 04:18:31,650
Who made you laugh the most?

14123
04:18:31,650 --> 04:18:37,830
Who made you laugh the most?

14124
04:18:31,730 --> 04:18:37,830
Out of these 5 participants, who made everyone laugh the most?

14125
04:18:38,650 --> 04:18:43,300
Out of these 5, you have to guess who got the most laughs

14126
04:18:39,850 --> 04:18:40,530
This is difficult

14127
04:18:40,540 --> 04:18:42,330
This is difficult

14128
04:18:42,330 --> 04:18:43,300
This is difficult

14129
04:18:43,310 --> 04:18:45,850
Who left the strongest impression on you, Hamada-san?

14130
04:18:43,930 --> 04:19:33,020
Harada,

Hakamada

14131
04:18:43,930 --> 04:19:33,020
Nishioka

14132
04:18:43,930 --> 04:19:33,020
Oyakata
Furiwake

14133
04:18:43,930 --> 04:19:33,020
Shibuki, Ozawa,
Natsuna

14134
04:18:43,930 --> 04:19:33,020
Takito

14135
04:18:43,930 --> 04:19:33,020

14140
04:18:45,850 --> 04:18:48,190
For me, it's Tokuma Nishioka

14141
04:18:48,470 --> 04:18:50,110
So it's Tokuma Nishioka for you

14142
04:18:50,030 --> 04:18:52,550
It was nice of him to do that

14143
04:18:52,690 --> 04:18:56,370
The deciding factor is the total number of laughs

14144
04:18:54,090 --> 04:18:54,510
Yeah

14145
04:18:55,190 --> 04:18:57,750
That's what I am thinking about too

14146
04:18:57,750 --> 04:19:00,420
Looking at the video, you can see different patterns

14147
04:18:58,430 --> 04:18:58,790
Yes

14148
04:19:00,420 --> 04:19:02,250
Looking at the video, you can see different patterns

14149
04:19:02,250 --> 04:19:05,320
Hakamada and Harada pair went on for a few years

14150
04:19:05,320 --> 04:19:07,360
Hakamada and Harada pair went on for a few years

14151
04:19:06,450 --> 04:19:07,030
Yes, a few years

14152
04:19:07,210 --> 04:19:08,730
Even the following year

14153
04:19:09,250 --> 04:19:11,490
Fortunately or unfortunately, Harada

14154
04:19:11,570 --> 04:19:12,960
As this time, Harada's affair was yet to be picked up by media

14155
04:19:12,960 --> 04:19:15,700
As this time, Harada's affair was yet to be picked up by media

14156
04:19:14,750 --> 04:19:15,690
Yep

14157
04:19:14,750 --> 04:19:15,690
Yep

14158
04:19:14,750 --> 04:19:15,690
Yep

14159
04:19:16,070 --> 04:19:17,970
He was only a Hentai Kamen

14160
04:19:18,600 --> 04:19:20,870
Turned out to be true, that character he played

14161
04:19:19,050 --> 04:19:20,870
In a way

14162
04:19:20,870 --> 04:19:23,070
He immersed himself into the character

14163
04:19:22,910 --> 04:19:24,670
Real Hentai Kamen

14164
04:19:23,830 --> 04:19:25,890
He could not get out of character

14165
04:19:24,650 --> 04:19:26,650
The character impacted him too much

14166
04:19:26,650 --> 04:19:29,910
That is one theory that's making the rounds

14167
04:19:28,310 --> 04:19:29,950
Is that so!

14168
04:19:29,950 --> 04:19:32,650
We got the following comments from the participants

14169
04:19:33,020 --> 04:19:49,570
Afterword: Jun Shibuki

14170
04:19:33,020 --> 04:19:49,570

14172
04:19:33,150 --> 04:19:41,320
Takarazuka fans were mad,

14173
04:19:34,530 --> 04:19:41,320
Asking her in person, "Why is a former top star

14174
04:19:36,480 --> 04:19:41,320
Doing such things!?"

14175
04:19:38,270 --> 04:19:40,050
She was scolded!

14176
04:19:39,170 --> 04:19:40,830
They all were scolded!

14177
04:19:40,230 --> 04:19:41,530
I see

14178
04:19:41,660 --> 04:19:49,570
After the show aired, many people asked me

14179
04:19:44,190 --> 04:19:49,570
"Are you an actress or a TV talent?"

14180
04:19:45,880 --> 04:19:49,570
And I started getting more challenging roles.

14181
04:19:48,010 --> 04:19:48,450
I see

14182
04:19:48,450 --> 04:19:50,190
Here's from Nishioka

14183
04:19:50,160 --> 04:20:08,320

Tokuma-san!

14187
04:19:50,780 --> 04:20:00,510
After the show aired, all my fellow actors said,

14188
04:19:53,750 --> 04:20:00,510
"You've raised the status of actors!

14189
04:19:56,920 --> 04:20:00,510
Amazing! You've inspired me to improve even more."

14190
04:20:00,210 --> 04:20:00,550
I see

14191
04:20:00,710 --> 04:20:08,320
"This was the most complimented gig in my entire life!"

14192
04:20:03,990 --> 04:20:06,880
Out of all his performances
to date, this was most well received

14193
04:20:06,880 --> 04:20:07,630
I see

14194
04:20:07,710 --> 04:20:08,210
Here we go

14195
04:20:08,550 --> 04:20:10,710
Everyone, please pick your numbers

14196
04:20:11,130 --> 04:20:12,550
Please put in your bets

14197
04:20:12,810 --> 04:20:15,960
Who got the most laughs?

14198
04:20:13,480 --> 04:20:16,480
This is so hard!

14199
04:20:16,480 --> 04:20:17,650
This is the last one right?

14200
04:20:17,350 --> 04:20:17,850
Yes, this is the final!

14201
04:20:18,300 --> 04:20:20,340
Then I gotta go all in

14202
04:20:19,660 --> 04:20:22,660
That's right, all in

14203
04:20:20,340 --> 04:20:22,490
But which one?

14204
04:20:22,800 --> 04:20:28,380
EVERYONE IS ALL IN

14205
04:20:22,800 --> 04:20:28,380

Yes, you're right

14216
04:20:26,110 --> 04:20:28,380
Have you all picked your numbers?

14217
04:20:27,800 --> 04:20:28,380
Yes!

14218

Ready, set...!

14231
04:20:30,740 --> 04:20:32,390
Can't have the same guess as Hamada

14232
04:20:32,390 --> 04:20:35,230
Oh no, it's the same!!

14233
04:20:33,560 --> 04:20:35,180
It's the same!

14234
04:20:35,230 --> 04:20:36,440
Wait a minute, this...

14235
04:20:37,250 --> 04:20:40,120
The moment the answers overlap with Hamada, there's no chance of winning

14236
04:20:39,270 --> 04:20:40,120
Okay then

14237
04:20:40,120 --> 04:20:42,850
I'll give you one chance to change your answer

14238
04:20:42,990 --> 04:20:46,120
What!? Then...

14239
04:20:46,680 --> 04:20:50,180
Excuse me, may I change my answer as well?

14240
04:20:48,450 --> 04:20:50,150
Of course, that's fine

14241
04:20:50,180 --> 04:20:50,950
Go ahead

14242
04:20:50,180 --> 04:20:51,190
Let's change

14243
04:20:52,240 --> 04:20:53,050
Five

14244
04:20:53,250 --> 04:20:55,580
Oh, five

14245
04:20:55,580 --> 04:20:56,330
Two

14246
04:20:56,330 --> 04:20:58,860
Why two?

14247
04:20:57,900 --> 04:20:59,320
Yes, I think it's two

14248
04:20:58,860 --> 04:21:00,030
That's plausible too

14249
04:20:59,840 --> 04:21:03,510
Endo, your four still overlaps with Hamada, are you okay with that?

14250
04:21:02,480 --> 04:21:05,190
But if it comes down to that, there's only number one left...

14251
04:21:06,050 --> 04:21:08,880
It's definitely not one

14252
04:21:06,760 --> 04:21:08,730
Yeah, I don't think it's one

14253
04:21:10,900 --> 04:21:12,730
It could be that all of you are wrong

14254
04:21:12,730 --> 04:21:13,580
Oh

14255
04:21:13,580 --> 04:21:14,300
There is that chance

14256
04:21:14,300 --> 04:21:16,230
Right, if it turns out to be one

14257
04:21:15,450 --> 04:21:16,220
That's right

14258
04:21:16,730 --> 04:21:18,180
Are we all ready!?

14259
04:21:18,570 --> 04:21:19,270
Yes!

14260
04:21:19,270 --> 04:21:20,020
Yes!

14261
04:21:19,270 --> 04:21:20,020

Yes!

14263

Yes!

14264
04:21:20,020 --> 04:21:21,430
Understood!

14265
04:21:21,430 --> 04:21:23,620
Here is the answer!

14266
04:21:23,010 --> 04:21:23,620
Please

14267
04:21:25,540 --> 04:21:27,000
The answer is...!

What's this?

And as custom prescribes, Chono vs. Hosei

15088

Stop that, what even is that?

15089
04:39:20,810 --> 04:39:23,580
Because it started with Kawashima

04:46:14,950 --> 04:46:19,020
NOOOoooo

15352
04:46:20,910 --> 04:46:21,880
HEY!

15353
04:46:22,560 --> 04:46:24,560
He doesn't want to because it's dirty

15354
04:46:22,560 --> 04:46:25,580
What the hell are you saying?

15355
04:46:24,560 --> 04:46:25,700
You can't say that

15356
04:46:26,800 --> 04:46:28,080
You can't say that

15357
04:46:30,350 --> 04:46:31,250
Stand up!

15358
04:46:31,400 --> 04:46:34,210
Come on and stand up already!!

15359
04:46:34,940 --> 04:46:36,610
Put this mouthpiece in your mouth

15360
04:46:36,610 --> 04:46:37,590
Mouthpiece?

15361
04:46:37,590 --> 04:46:39,940
Let's hurry up and do this!!

15362
04:46:40,710 --> 04:46:41,680
Papa!!

15363
04:46:41,680 --> 04:46:42,820
Papa!!

15364
04:46:43,080 --> 04:46:46,000
Give him a good hard slap!!

15365
04:46:44,350 --> 04:46:46,000
Give him a good hard slap!!

15366
04:46:46,030 --> 04:46:51,160
WHAT THE HELL ARE YOU SAYING??

15367
04:46:53,520 --> 04:46:55,460
I thought she was gonna stop him

15368
04:46:55,630 --> 04:46:57,630
Yeah, the way she interrupted them

15369
04:47:01,970 --> 04:47:04,940
Quit your whining!

15370
04:47:08,140 --> 04:47:09,580
Papa!!

15371
04:47:09,580 --> 04:47:14,210
Bring him

15372
04:47:10,780 --> 04:47:14,210
the pain

15373
04:47:12,210 --> 04:47:14,210
hard!!

15374
04:47:14,210 --> 04:47:20,050
Give it to him!!

15375
04:47:15,010 --> 04:47:20,050
Intensely!!

15376
04:47:17,720 --> 04:47:19,370
This is rough

15377
04:47:20,430 --> 04:47:22,200
Come on

15378
04:47:29,090 --> 04:47:31,600
Wait a minute Hosei

15379
04:47:31,760 --> 04:47:34,000
I'll give you a chance

15380
04:47:34,430 --> 04:47:35,600
Unlike every other year please give me a real chance

15381
04:47:35,600 --> 04:47:37,140
Unlike every other year please give me a real chance

15382
04:47:37,340 --> 04:47:38,570
Alright, bring it out!!

15383
04:47:38,570 --> 04:47:40,370
Alright, bring it out!!

15384
04:47:40,690 --> 04:47:46,140
Slap avoidance chance has arrived

15385
04:47:40,690 --> 04:47:46,140
Slap avoidance chance has arrived

15386
04:47:40,690 --> 04:47:46,140
Slap avoidance chance has arrived

15387
04:47:46,360 --> 04:47:51,520
3 pairs of panties

15388
04:47:46,360 --> 04:47:51,520
3 pairs of panties

15389
04:47:46,360 --> 04:47:51,520
3 pairs of panties

15390
04:47:47,330 --> 04:47:48,380
Just as you see here

15391
04:47:49,130 --> 04:47:50,360
There are 3 pairs of panties

15392
04:47:51,820 --> 04:47:52,930
If you

15393
04:47:53,990 --> 04:47:55,220
In 30 seconds

15394
04:47:55,600 --> 04:47:56,850
Can rip all these panties

15395
04:47:57,050 --> 04:47:58,410
You're safe

15396
04:47:58,590 --> 04:48:05,660
m 0 873 l 1920 873 1920 1003.5 0 1003.5

15397
04:47:58,610 --> 04:48:05,660
If the panties are ripped in 30 seconds the slap is avoided

15398
04:47:59,870 --> 04:48:00,440
You gonna do it?

15399
04:48:00,690 --> 04:48:01,680
I'll do it

15400
04:48:01,810 --> 04:48:02,980
Are you serious with this?

15401
04:48:03,290 --> 04:48:04,130
Alright then

15402
04:48:04,450 --> 04:48:05,000
Understood

15403
04:48:05,350 --> 04:48:08,330
I'll take responsibility for timing the 30 seconds

15404
04:48:07,200 --> 04:48:08,080
30 seconds!

15405
04:48:08,870 --> 04:48:10,500
That alright?

15406
04:48:10,500 --> 04:48:11,350
Alright

15407
04:48:11,870 --> 04:48:12,620
Let's do this!

15408
04:48:11,870 --> 04:48:13,070
Good luck!!

15409
04:48:13,400 --> 04:48:14,270
Ready

15410
04:48:15,620 --> 04:48:16,940
Start!

15411
04:48:17,910 --> 04:48:19,460
Alright that's good

15412
04:48:19,010 --> 04:48:20,340
Alright!!

15413
04:48:19,180 --> 04:48:21,680
1st pair clear

15414
04:48:21,680 --> 04:48:22,900
You still have time!

15415
04:48:21,680 --> 04:48:47,870
Seconds

15416
04:48:21,680 --> 04:48:47,870
Time remaining

15417
04:48:24,350 --> 04:48:25,030
How many seconds left?

15418
04:48:25,180 --> 04:48:25,620
Let's see

15419
04:48:25,950 --> 04:48:27,050
10 seconds have passed

15420
04:48:27,740 --> 04:48:30,070
Yes! Alright!

15421
04:48:29,850 --> 04:48:31,920
2nd pair clear

15422
04:48:31,040 --> 04:48:31,460
Okay

15423
04:48:31,460 --> 04:48:32,410
15 seconds left

15424
04:48:32,410 --> 04:48:33,260
15 seconds okay

15425
04:48:34,010 --> 04:48:34,910
Alright alright

15426
04:48:36,030 --> 04:48:40,580
The elastic is stretching and can't rip

15427
04:48:36,130 --> 04:48:37,110
What the hell are you doing?

15428
04:48:37,110 --> 04:48:37,810
10 seconds left

15429
04:48:38,630 --> 04:48:39,900
10 seconds left, okay

15430
04:48:42,180 --> 04:48:43,120
Five

15431
04:48:43,120 --> 04:48:43,920
Four

15432
04:48:43,920 --> 04:48:44,900
Three

15433
04:48:44,900 --> 04:48:45,900
Two

15434
04:48:45,900 --> 04:48:46,900
One

15435
04:48:46,900 --> 04:48:48,590
Time!!

15436
04:48:57,100 --> 04:48:59,620
That's expected

15437
04:48:58,830 --> 04:49:00,580
It was impossible to rip

15438
04:49:00,990 --> 04:49:07,430
Challenge failed; the slap is decided

15439
04:49:00,990 --> 04:49:07,430
Challenge failed; the slap is decided

15440
04:49:03,620 --> 04:49:05,560
You were close, that was a big deal

15441
04:49:07,430 --> 04:49:10,130
I'm really sorry for this, year after year

15442
04:49:08,290 --> 04:49:10,130
I'm really sorry for this, year after year

15443
04:49:10,530 --> 04:49:11,830
Let's do this!!

15444
04:49:12,150 --> 04:49:13,400
Alright let's do this!

15445
04:49:13,400 --> 04:49:13,750
Ok!

15446
04:49:13,750 --> 04:49:14,270
Ok!

15447
04:49:20,870 --> 04:49:21,770
Okay!

15448
04:49:26,040 --> 04:49:31,580
Explosive Slap of Justice

15449
04:49:32,990 --> 04:49:38,260
GOD  DAMN!!

15450
04:49:33,490 --> 04:49:38,260
GOD  DAMN!!

15451
04:49:38,360 --> 04:49:41,090
That was a grimy slap

15452
04:49:40,740 --> 04:49:42,740
The new year has come eh?

15453
04:49:41,090 --> 04:49:43,090
That looked painful

15454
04:49:43,460 --> 04:49:44,880
That looked extremely painful

15455
04:49:46,980 --> 04:49:52,440
It's over

15456
04:49:55,890 --> 04:50:00,800
It's over

15457
04:49:56,260 --> 04:49:57,780
It's finally over, huh?

15458
04:49:57,490 --> 04:49:59,160
Yep it's over, huh?

15459
04:49:59,020 --> 04:50:00,820
Thank you for your hard work every year

15460
04:50:03,780 --> 04:50:05,020
Thanks for your hard work

15461
04:50:06,480 --> 04:50:08,480
You were close to avoiding it though

15462
04:50:09,850 --> 04:50:12,140
Putting the panties in your mouth was a big no go?

15463
04:50:12,410 --> 04:50:13,970
I didn't wanna put them in my mouth

15464
04:50:14,530 --> 04:50:15,160
And?

15465
04:50:16,930 --> 04:50:19,600
Go in your mouth

15466
04:50:16,930 --> 04:50:19,600
Panties aren't supposed to

15467
04:50:23,260 --> 04:50:24,510
Well yeah, right?

15468
04:50:25,560 --> 04:50:29,480
The grand Las Vegas festival ran long for the five of them

15469
04:50:29,550 --> 04:50:43,760
Amount of butt slaps

15470

15475
04:50:30,780 --> 04:50:34,050
Chouno's wife is so elegant

15476
04:50:34,050 --> 04:50:36,690
Those numbers are always last to be revealed

15477
04:50:38,190 --> 04:50:43,760
Following this we will broadcast a song by that diva

15478
04:50:48,880 --> 04:50:55,420
