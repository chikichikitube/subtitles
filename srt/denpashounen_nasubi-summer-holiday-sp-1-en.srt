1
00:00:00,020 --> 00:00:01,460
It's Nasubi ♥

2
00:00:01,560 --> 00:00:03,700
Can people live by only winning prize contests?

3
00:00:03,730 --> 00:00:07,660
The challenge is to win prizes by phone or post card entry

4
00:00:07,700 --> 00:00:09,380
The goal is a 1 million Yen in prizes

5
00:00:09,410 --> 00:00:11,930
The man that continues this challenge is Nasubi

6
00:00:13,130 --> 00:00:14,800
To fill in the details so far...

7
00:00:15,330 --> 00:00:18,030
January of this year was the start (1998)

8
00:00:18,560 --> 00:00:21,220
And suddenly 9 months have already passed!

9
00:00:21,720 --> 00:00:27,280
Up to this point, the total prize value of winnings is 559,374 Yen!

10
00:00:27,430 --> 00:00:31,020
He continues writing postcards to earn 1 million Yen worth of prizes!!

11
00:00:31,910 --> 00:00:35,700
By the way, are there any viewers that have noticed Nasubi's transformation?

12
00:00:36,620 --> 00:00:39,020
This is before the transformation

13
00:00:40,050 --> 00:00:42,660
And this is after!

14
00:00:44,490 --> 00:00:46,410
That's right! He's sun burnt!

15
00:00:46,930 --> 00:00:51,120
This sunburn happened in an un-aired episode!

16
00:00:51,460 --> 00:00:53,300
That was...

17
00:00:54,200 --> 00:00:55,980
Midnight of that day...

18
00:01:00,040 --> 00:01:02,040
The producer appears!

19
00:01:02,570 --> 00:01:04,180
The producer is still scheming!

20
00:01:04,180 --> 00:01:05,840
He must have the keys!

21
00:01:11,980 --> 00:01:13,980
Is this really ok?!

22
00:01:19,900 --> 00:01:22,840
With the light in his face Nasubi awakes!

23
00:01:23,830 --> 00:01:26,500
But he is totally clueless to the situation!

24
00:01:27,030 --> 00:01:31,140
He knows from experience the light summons an evil monster...

25
00:01:38,040 --> 00:01:39,340
Have you realised?

26
00:01:39,640 --> 00:01:40,700
Yes?

27
00:01:40,910 --> 00:01:42,480
Then Nasubi...

28
00:01:42,810 --> 00:01:43,690
Huh?

29
00:01:43,980 --> 00:01:47,400
With Nasubi's uncertain voice,
does he assume he's reached the goal?!

30
00:01:47,570 --> 00:01:50,300
I have won some seriously premium items...

31
00:01:47,570 --> 00:01:50,330
Hirosue Ryoko signed poster

32
00:01:51,160 --> 00:01:53,890
It's obvious that's the situation right?

33
00:01:53,890 --> 00:01:54,700
No.

34
00:01:54,700 --> 00:01:55,760
SHOCK!

35
00:01:55,760 --> 00:01:57,280
Then the producer...

36
00:01:58,100 --> 00:01:59,200
Eyemask

37
00:02:00,500 --> 00:02:02,840
We're moving house again?

38
00:02:03,000 --> 00:02:04,660
June 28th broadcast

39
00:02:03,740 --> 00:02:09,280
This circumstance occoured once before and lead to the moving to a new home

40
00:02:10,140 --> 00:02:13,300
Again, he is made to wear headphones with super loud music

41
00:02:14,480 --> 00:02:20,080
And not forgetting, he is wearing the black leather shoes he won previously also!

42
00:02:20,490 --> 00:02:22,490
Nasubi is lead outside...

43
00:02:23,620 --> 00:02:25,620
And taken on a road trip!

44
00:02:26,090 --> 00:02:28,090
Is he moving house once again?!

45
00:02:29,530 --> 00:02:33,970
Nasubi's car journey continues through the night into a new day!

46
00:02:35,530 --> 00:02:38,200
And continues for over 12 hours!

47
00:02:38,670 --> 00:02:41,660
Haven't we been driving for way too long now?

48
00:02:42,340 --> 00:02:45,080
Nasubi is getting anxious!

49
00:02:46,010 --> 00:02:48,880
We continue across a massive bridge!

50
00:02:49,650 --> 00:02:51,120
Suddenly Nasubi...

51
00:02:51,680 --> 00:02:53,370
Maybe I should try and nap...

52
00:02:53,370 --> 00:02:54,970
And he falls asleep once more.

53
00:02:55,690 --> 00:02:57,980
He continues to sleep for another 5 hours!

54
00:02:59,060 --> 00:03:01,730
When he opens his eyes just where will he be?!

55
00:03:05,300 --> 00:03:07,060
In a boat!

56
00:03:07,870 --> 00:03:09,460
But Nasubi thinks...

57
00:03:09,870 --> 00:03:10,930
An earthquake?!

58
00:03:11,270 --> 00:03:14,240
He has no idea how to judge where or what he is on

59
00:03:15,370 --> 00:03:17,530
Ah, the breeze feels great!

60
00:03:18,460 --> 00:03:20,840
I'm kinda getting splashed with water here

61
00:03:21,210 --> 00:03:22,380
That's when...

62
00:03:22,380 --> 00:03:23,780
Is this a boat?!

63
00:03:23,780 --> 00:03:25,580
He finally realised!

64
00:03:25,980 --> 00:03:29,370
Even so, this is really taking a long time...

65
00:03:29,380 --> 00:03:30,850
I'm kinda scared

66
00:03:31,460 --> 00:03:33,890
Unable to see, he is stricken with fear!

67
00:03:34,460 --> 00:03:37,170
Just where is Nasubi being taken to ?!

68
00:03:37,900 --> 00:03:40,360
His journey will soon be over...

69
00:03:41,070 --> 00:03:42,700
He finally arrives!

70
00:03:42,800 --> 00:03:43,810
It's okay to remove the eyemask now

71
00:03:49,140 --> 00:03:51,860
After a drastic jump, what's the first thing he see's?

72
00:03:55,450 --> 00:03:57,060
The sea!

73
00:03:59,620 --> 00:04:01,690
Wha.. Where? Is this?

74
00:04:02,090 --> 00:04:03,490
That's when...

75
00:04:06,590 --> 00:04:09,000
It's the inflatable ring I won

76
00:04:09,630 --> 00:04:10,180
Right?

77
00:04:10,330 --> 00:04:11,200
You don't get it?

78
00:04:13,470 --> 00:04:15,180
We're going swimming in the sea? ♥

79
00:04:15,400 --> 00:04:17,540
Correct

80
00:04:18,600 --> 00:04:23,330
After this the staff reveal the true intention of this distant journey...

81
00:04:23,640 --> 00:04:25,970
Summer holiday

82
00:04:27,010 --> 00:04:28,210
Uhahaha!♥

83
00:04:28,350 --> 00:04:37,220
After continuously writing postcards daily inside for 9 months of the challenge, it's a present from the staff!

84
00:04:28,350 --> 00:04:37,220
Summer holiday!

85
00:04:39,520 --> 00:04:42,680
This is really a summer holiday?!

86
00:04:39,690 --> 00:04:42,760
He's super ecstatic

87
00:04:43,700 --> 00:04:45,700
Then upon seeing the sea, Nasubi...

88
00:04:46,330 --> 00:04:49,250
Sea water is salty, right?

89
00:04:49,250 --> 00:04:50,560
Salty!?

90
00:04:50,670 --> 00:04:56,210
To this point Nasubi hasn't won any salty foods at all!

91
00:04:50,780 --> 00:04:51,650
I want some side dishes!

92
00:04:51,650 --> 00:04:54,140
A flavor with impact!

93
00:04:55,040 --> 00:04:57,240
Something greasy!

94
00:04:57,540 --> 00:04:58,960
That's when...

95
00:04:59,040 --> 00:05:00,610
Can I go and give it a little taste?

96
00:05:00,640 --> 00:05:02,160
He wants to drink it!

97
00:05:03,780 --> 00:05:05,220
Well then, please exscuse me!

98
00:05:07,220 --> 00:05:08,160
Wait!

99
00:05:08,990 --> 00:05:09,970
Before that...

100
00:05:09,970 --> 00:05:11,700
The mic will get wet so...

101
00:05:12,260 --> 00:05:14,530
Please use this waterproof one ♥

102
00:05:14,660 --> 00:05:16,170
I'm going in then!

103
00:05:26,370 --> 00:05:27,970
SALTY ♥

104
00:05:30,240 --> 00:05:31,660
SALTY ! ♥♥

105
00:05:31,780 --> 00:05:33,000
It's good!

106
00:05:33,080 --> 00:05:34,580
Can I go once more?

107
00:05:35,110 --> 00:05:36,400
Sea!

108
00:05:36,480 --> 00:05:37,930
Sea water!!

109
00:05:42,950 --> 00:05:44,290
So salty ♥♥♥

110
00:05:44,460 --> 00:05:49,620
Denpa Shonen presents Nasubi's summer holiday at the coast festival special movie!

111
00:05:50,500 --> 00:05:53,700
Nasubi is deeply moved by the long lost taste of the sea water

112
00:05:54,670 --> 00:05:56,670
Then the staff inform Nasubi...

113
00:05:57,270 --> 00:05:58,140
Here

114
00:05:58,200 --> 00:06:00,200
Camera

115
00:06:00,540 --> 00:06:01,880
I have to film myself?

116
00:06:00,540 --> 00:06:02,860
Tripod

117
00:06:01,880 --> 00:06:02,840
Yeah ♥

118
00:06:03,140 --> 00:06:05,250
How long is this holiday planned for?

119
00:06:05,340 --> 00:06:06,460
As long as you want ♥

120
00:06:07,180 --> 00:06:08,340
Huh?!

121
00:06:08,500 --> 00:06:10,130
As long as you enjoy it ♥

122
00:06:10,480 --> 00:06:11,970
Upon hearing that Nasubi...

123
00:06:12,320 --> 00:06:16,130
Well let's enjoy this holiday for a while then!

124
00:06:16,920 --> 00:06:19,970
But then Nasubi realises some things...

125
00:06:21,760 --> 00:06:23,460
What about food?

126
00:06:24,330 --> 00:06:25,650
Apparently there is plenty around ♥

127
00:06:27,530 --> 00:06:30,450
You mean from the locals?

128
00:06:30,600 --> 00:06:32,080
Then the staff inform him...

129
00:06:32,240 --> 00:06:33,370
It's a deserted island!

130
00:06:35,970 --> 00:06:39,060
Ah.. It looks like people would live here you know!

131
00:06:40,150 --> 00:06:41,840
That's right, this is...

132
00:06:42,170 --> 00:06:42,650
Please take off the eye mask

133
00:06:47,750 --> 00:06:49,320
Deserted island!

134
00:06:50,190 --> 00:06:54,060
Denpa Shonen's
R-Mania escape from a desert island!

135
00:06:54,430 --> 00:06:59,370
R-Mania where actually able to escape from this deserted island where Nasubi now is!

136
00:07:01,900 --> 00:07:07,650
This is where R-Mania where dropped off,
and Nasubi is here!

137
00:07:08,210 --> 00:07:11,640
Of course, Nasubi knows nothing about the island!

138
00:07:12,580 --> 00:07:14,720
But seriously, what should I do about food?

139
00:07:14,720 --> 00:07:16,530
Like I said, the island has loads!

140
00:07:17,680 --> 00:07:18,330
Ehhhh!

141
00:07:18,480 --> 00:07:19,820
There's a shit load of shellfish!

142
00:07:20,250 --> 00:07:26,180
R-Mania where able to scavange plenty of food to live on from the sea and mountains

143
00:07:26,290 --> 00:07:28,290
I have to forage for it?!

144
00:07:28,570 --> 00:07:30,680
But one thing is already prepared...

145
00:07:32,930 --> 00:07:35,340
Please wait a second!

146
00:07:33,580 --> 00:07:35,340
Previously
won rice

147
00:07:36,200 --> 00:07:44,330
In preparation for this holiday the staff have packed all the useful winnings for cooking and making fire

148
00:07:37,440 --> 00:07:38,800
BBQ set

149
00:07:38,800 --> 00:07:40,730
Sake can
and cutlery

150
00:07:40,730 --> 00:07:41,340
Towel

151
00:07:41,370 --> 00:07:42,380
Towel

152
00:07:42,450 --> 00:07:44,380
Lighter

153
00:07:44,510 --> 00:07:47,040
You said 'preparation' but it's all my stuff!

154
00:07:48,180 --> 00:07:51,730
If you go on a leisure trip, of course you'd take your own stuff!

155
00:07:53,490 --> 00:07:54,610
So that's how it is

156
00:07:54,950 --> 00:07:56,610
But what about water?

157
00:07:56,960 --> 00:07:58,010
Just for you

158
00:07:59,490 --> 00:08:03,370
I was wondering how you where going to bring the kitchen here!

159
00:07:59,490 --> 00:08:03,370
Purified water from the filter he won

160
00:08:03,730 --> 00:08:05,450
Enjoy your holiday then!

161
00:08:06,760 --> 00:08:08,660
You're really leaving?

162
00:08:08,660 --> 00:08:11,020
Wait a second!

163
00:08:11,640 --> 00:08:12,770
Hey!!!

164
00:08:12,770 --> 00:08:14,100
But then!

165
00:08:14,100 --> 00:08:14,620
Ah! We forgot!

166
00:08:14,970 --> 00:08:19,250
The staff return to see Nasubi

167
00:08:14,970 --> 00:08:19,250
What is it? Are you worried I'll be lonely?

168
00:08:19,510 --> 00:08:20,890
You need your diary!

169
00:08:22,310 --> 00:08:22,640
Bye!

170
00:08:26,420 --> 00:08:28,730
Nasubi

171
00:08:28,730 --> 00:08:30,490
They seriously left me...

172
00:08:31,360 --> 00:08:35,200
3 dairy books now on sale!

173
00:08:31,360 --> 00:08:35,200
Please enjoy the entries from Nasubi's over sea dairy!

174
00:08:37,830 --> 00:08:40,410
I wonder if it's set right? (Camera setup)

175
00:08:41,200 --> 00:08:45,380
"Of course I was expecting that from the staff of Denpa Shonen"

176
00:08:45,460 --> 00:08:48,840
"They sailed off into the horizon across the sea."

177
00:08:49,710 --> 00:08:50,690
Troublesome!

178
00:08:50,880 --> 00:08:55,810
"Anyway I can't pass up this chance to swim in the sea and bask in the sun!"

179
00:08:55,860 --> 00:08:58,640
"This summer holiday is going to be super fun!

180
00:09:00,250 --> 00:09:05,890
Let's enjoy this summer holiday to the fullest and really have fun!

181
00:09:06,320 --> 00:09:10,000
♪ It's Nasbi's private beach! ♪

182
00:09:10,060 --> 00:09:12,490
♪ I'm the only one in the sea! ♪

183
00:09:12,930 --> 00:09:16,120
Let's get in the sea, yay!

184
00:09:16,630 --> 00:09:19,500
The first time this year Nasubi has gone in the sea

185
00:09:20,870 --> 00:09:26,130
Waaa! The sea! Sea water! Summer holiday! Yay!

186
00:09:27,410 --> 00:09:29,770
Nasubi frolics happily in the sea ♥

187
00:09:30,250 --> 00:09:31,800
But...

188
00:09:32,380 --> 00:09:37,160
"The inflatable ring that I won has transformed me from a useless swimmer to sailing like a boat!"

189
00:09:37,820 --> 00:09:39,820
He can't swim.

190
00:09:40,630 --> 00:09:41,820
And then...

191
00:09:44,000 --> 00:09:46,220
The first time this year sun bathing!

192
00:09:47,370 --> 00:09:50,480
"But today's weather is cloudy"

193
00:09:51,170 --> 00:09:52,610
Then...

194
00:09:53,770 --> 00:09:56,240
I'm not catching a suntan at all!

195
00:09:56,410 --> 00:10:00,780
Ok! Let's go for a little wander instead

196
00:10:02,550 --> 00:10:05,810
The expedition footage with Nasubi and tripod starts!

197
00:10:06,480 --> 00:10:08,660
Zun ♪ Zun ♪ Zun ♪ Zun ♪

198
00:10:10,010 --> 00:10:12,080
What's that over there I wonder?

199
00:10:13,060 --> 00:10:15,530
He comes across a rocky area...

200
00:10:16,960 --> 00:10:22,730
"As I'm walikng along I'm sure to find some seafood as a side dish for tonight's dinner!"

201
00:10:23,170 --> 00:10:25,740
There's nothing but a load of Wharf roaches

202
00:10:26,600 --> 00:10:28,600
I need to come up with a plan!

203
00:10:29,110 --> 00:10:31,110
I can't eat these Wharf roaches

204
00:10:32,210 --> 00:10:36,620
It doesn't look like there is much around here to make into tonight's side dish

205
00:10:37,450 --> 00:10:40,380
Then Nasubi notices something about the sea

206
00:10:40,920 --> 00:10:44,820
The tide is coming in now, it should rise some more...

207
00:10:45,560 --> 00:10:48,720
Nasubi notices the tide rising up

208
00:10:50,090 --> 00:10:53,970
As expected of a deserted island...

209
00:10:54,470 --> 00:10:56,370
But when he's walking...

210
00:10:56,830 --> 00:10:57,730
Oh?!

211
00:10:57,840 --> 00:10:59,580
It's an onion!

212
00:10:59,580 --> 00:11:01,020
Onion discovery!

213
00:11:01,240 --> 00:11:08,040
R-Mania made the same onion discovery and made it into a daily staple!

214
00:11:08,410 --> 00:11:11,520
Either way, finding an onion looks like it will be ok!

215
00:11:12,120 --> 00:11:13,940
The next thing he finds on the walk...

216
00:11:15,090 --> 00:11:16,220
Oh?!

217
00:11:16,890 --> 00:11:19,900
Look over there, it seems to be an oil drum?

218
00:11:20,730 --> 00:11:22,380
But this oil drum!

219
00:11:22,830 --> 00:11:27,560
Behind me is forest and infront is the sea! Amazing!

220
00:11:28,000 --> 00:11:31,760
The oil drum R-Mania made into a bath!

221
00:11:32,000 --> 00:11:34,000
I wonder who's been burning this?

222
00:11:34,000 --> 00:11:35,050
A bath?

223
00:11:35,050 --> 00:11:38,490
Who bathes in a drum in this day and age...?

224
00:11:38,490 --> 00:11:40,490
Don't be stupid!

225
00:11:41,380 --> 00:11:44,000
Next, Nasubi ventures into the forest...

226
00:11:44,120 --> 00:11:44,530
Oh?!

227
00:11:44,530 --> 00:11:46,940
It looks like some kind of cabin...

228
00:11:46,940 --> 00:11:48,660
Cabin discovery!

229
00:11:50,490 --> 00:11:53,120
Looks like they were making stuff in here...

230
00:11:53,520 --> 00:11:54,640
That's when...

231
00:11:54,990 --> 00:11:55,970
What the fuck's this?

232
00:11:56,090 --> 00:11:58,090
R R R R R R R R R R R R R R R R R R R R R

233
00:11:59,100 --> 00:12:00,700
This is!

234
00:12:01,430 --> 00:12:03,620
Good morning

235
00:12:04,100 --> 00:12:11,650
While R-Mania where staying on this island, every day they were here, they marked this board with an 'R'!

236
00:12:12,340 --> 00:12:13,810
Upon seeing this, Nasubi...

237
00:12:14,610 --> 00:12:16,730
I dunno what the shit this is, but it's spooky

238
00:12:16,770 --> 00:12:18,360
Some kind of witchcraft?

239
00:12:18,360 --> 00:12:20,770
I don't wanna be finding this sort of thing!

240
00:12:21,120 --> 00:12:22,760
Fear

241
00:12:22,890 --> 00:12:25,480
I, Nasubi didn't see anything ok!

242
00:12:25,560 --> 00:12:27,690
Please don't let anything weird happen!

243
00:12:28,290 --> 00:12:30,380
What was up with that RRRR?

244
00:12:30,460 --> 00:12:31,360
BAD VIBES!

245
00:12:32,760 --> 00:12:34,000
And then!

246
00:12:34,400 --> 00:12:37,420
This is bad I can't see the sea at all

247
00:12:37,420 --> 00:12:38,760
Am I lost?

248
00:12:39,400 --> 00:12:41,050
Is it the curse of 'R'?!

249
00:12:41,640 --> 00:12:44,240
Nasubi has lost his way in the forest

250
00:12:44,540 --> 00:12:46,540
It was a bad idea to come in the forest

251
00:12:47,110 --> 00:12:49,450
He continues lost in the forest for over 2 hours!

252
00:12:50,050 --> 00:12:52,340
Ah! I found the sea!

253
00:12:52,950 --> 00:12:54,690
He finally came out at the coast.

254
00:12:55,390 --> 00:12:57,240
And returned to his drop off point

255
00:12:57,760 --> 00:13:01,650
The area scouting is completed

256
00:13:02,690 --> 00:13:05,460
Alot of time has passed and it will soon be dark

257
00:13:07,140 --> 00:13:11,580
I'll have to cook dinner on a fire so first I should search for some wood to burn

258
00:13:12,600 --> 00:13:16,060
He spends over an hour searching for kindling

259
00:13:14,470 --> 00:13:16,060
Stuff he found earlier
Bucket ect...

260
00:13:17,010 --> 00:13:18,730
Firewood gathered

261
00:13:18,740 --> 00:13:20,100
But Nasubi...

262
00:13:20,210 --> 00:13:23,050
Gathering wood is hard work

263
00:13:23,150 --> 00:13:24,490
Exhausted.

264
00:13:24,490 --> 00:13:25,880
But then!

265
00:13:26,380 --> 00:13:27,290
Observe

266
00:13:29,390 --> 00:13:30,820
A rabbit!

267
00:13:37,560 --> 00:13:39,280
This rabbit...

268
00:13:40,130 --> 00:13:41,440
Mama is fitting!

269
00:13:41,440 --> 00:13:43,440
Let's go with Mama then?

270
00:13:43,970 --> 00:13:50,050
During R-Mania's stay on the island they adopted a family member, the wild rabbit Mama... Could it be?

271
00:13:50,050 --> 00:13:51,530
See ya Mama!

272
00:13:51,040 --> 00:13:54,480
When they left the island, this was the final farewell

273
00:13:53,420 --> 00:13:56,650
We're really grateful for everything!

274
00:13:54,650 --> 00:13:56,650
But Nasubi...

275
00:13:59,180 --> 00:14:01,100
He's surprised by Mama.

276
00:14:04,890 --> 00:14:07,530
"What the fuck was that just now?"

277
00:14:09,230 --> 00:14:11,880
It's time to prepare dinner

278
00:14:12,260 --> 00:14:14,260
First is to put the rice and water in the can...

279
00:14:15,120 --> 00:14:18,060
Using the lighter he ignites the kindling in the BBQ set

280
00:14:18,600 --> 00:14:20,360
Rice cooking starts!

281
00:14:20,710 --> 00:14:21,780
Then...

282
00:14:21,870 --> 00:14:23,770
Uwah! The can is burnt completely black!

283
00:14:23,840 --> 00:14:25,420
High intensity fire!!

284
00:14:27,010 --> 00:14:29,010
No! Please stop!!

285
00:14:31,180 --> 00:14:33,020
Rice cooking finished...

286
00:14:34,450 --> 00:14:36,610
Has he just wasted a serving?

287
00:14:37,890 --> 00:14:39,890
Itadakimasu!

288
00:14:40,830 --> 00:14:42,830
But what about the flavor?

289
00:14:44,160 --> 00:14:44,820
Mm?

290
00:14:47,330 --> 00:14:49,200
It's great ♥

291
00:14:49,660 --> 00:14:50,980
After this Nasubi...

292
00:14:51,940 --> 00:14:54,320
He washes the onion he found in the sea...

293
00:14:54,670 --> 00:14:58,360
Cut's it with the knife he brought and then flame grilled!

294
00:14:58,980 --> 00:14:59,900
Finished!

295
00:15:02,010 --> 00:15:04,010
The taste of the onion?

296
00:15:08,520 --> 00:15:10,260
It's delicious ♥

297
00:15:11,520 --> 00:15:15,020
I'm alone on a deserted island but it seems I can cope quite well!

298
00:15:17,130 --> 00:15:18,320
Later on that night

299
00:15:19,230 --> 00:15:22,000
Nasubi writes in his diary...

300
00:15:22,280 --> 00:15:29,170
"The rice and onion was delicious, another 2 or 3 days of this and I'll become one with mother nature!"

301
00:15:30,110 --> 00:15:33,010
The first day of Nasubi's summer holiday is over

302
00:15:34,050 --> 00:15:37,080
The next morning

303
00:15:38,520 --> 00:15:39,960
It looks so refreshing!

304
00:15:40,920 --> 00:15:42,460
He's awake.

305
00:15:42,650 --> 00:15:44,650
Eh?! He slept on the beach?

306
00:15:45,460 --> 00:15:48,520
Nasubi starts the 2nd day of summer holiday!

307
00:15:49,730 --> 00:15:55,980
"It was like being born for the first time, the rays
from the sun engulfing me as I opened my eyes...
I am Nasubi."

308
00:15:57,570 --> 00:16:00,460
Yawn

309
00:16:02,640 --> 00:16:04,530
Good morning

310
00:16:06,090 --> 00:16:08,810
"Today is completely different from yesterday"

311
00:16:08,810 --> 00:16:13,010
"I can see far into the horizon of the completely blue sky, is it going to be fun I wonder!"

312
00:16:13,680 --> 00:16:15,530
Today Nasubi again...

313
00:16:16,820 --> 00:16:18,290
Sea swimming ♥

314
00:16:18,370 --> 00:16:19,490
That's cool!

315
00:16:19,560 --> 00:16:20,660
And then...

316
00:16:21,930 --> 00:16:22,900
Ah, this is great!

317
00:16:23,290 --> 00:16:24,900
Sunbathing ♥

318
00:16:25,530 --> 00:16:30,050
Forgetting everything he enjoys the summer holiday to the max!

319
00:16:34,010 --> 00:16:35,330
Then...

320
00:16:35,440 --> 00:16:36,180
Mm?!

321
00:16:36,370 --> 00:16:39,090
What a feeling, I'm starting to tan!

322
00:16:39,410 --> 00:16:41,410
I'm tanning right?

323
00:16:42,750 --> 00:16:45,940
He certainly has tanned!

324
00:16:46,150 --> 00:16:50,570
I'm tanning nicely and becoming even more handsome!

325
00:16:51,920 --> 00:16:54,490
It feels great to be out in the sun light!

326
00:16:54,490 --> 00:16:56,780
I could stay like this forever!

327
00:16:57,030 --> 00:16:58,200
I'm so happy!

328
00:16:58,760 --> 00:17:00,250
Summer holiday

329
00:17:00,250 --> 00:17:02,020
Summer holiday

330
00:17:00,250 --> 00:17:02,020
is great! ♥

331
00:17:03,070 --> 00:17:05,980
All Nasubi does is sunbathe all day

332
00:17:08,640 --> 00:17:09,980
Then...

333
00:17:10,540 --> 00:17:13,970
It seems like low tide right now

334
00:17:14,210 --> 00:17:18,700
Let's check out that rocky area from yesterday and find some seafood!

335
00:17:19,440 --> 00:17:22,370
This is where we searched yesterday

336
00:17:22,720 --> 00:17:26,890
It doesn't seem like there's anything here but...

337
00:17:26,920 --> 00:17:28,010
Just then!

338
00:17:28,360 --> 00:17:29,260
Oh?!

339
00:17:29,290 --> 00:17:30,690
Here here here!

340
00:17:30,760 --> 00:17:32,440
Shell discovery!

341
00:17:34,230 --> 00:17:37,970
This gives me a good feeling about this area!

342
00:17:38,470 --> 00:17:43,040
Let's have a little look at what we have here

343
00:17:45,610 --> 00:17:47,050
One shellfish GET!

344
00:17:47,380 --> 00:17:49,010
Looking good huh!

345
00:17:49,850 --> 00:17:57,250
As the tide is completely different to yesterday, he shares the same good fortune as R-Mania finding plenty of shellfish!

346
00:17:53,540 --> 00:17:56,840
Ensure you have the relevant fishing permits or permission!

347
00:17:57,760 --> 00:17:59,290
Check it out!

348
00:17:59,590 --> 00:18:00,840
Then straight after...

349
00:18:01,630 --> 00:18:02,890
Flame grilled.

350
00:18:03,060 --> 00:18:07,360
Please observe! Looking so tasty bubbling away!

351
00:18:08,230 --> 00:18:09,280
And so...

352
00:18:09,800 --> 00:18:11,100
Let's eat ♥

353
00:18:11,570 --> 00:18:13,000
Eaten.

354
00:18:22,650 --> 00:18:23,860
Delicious!

355
00:18:25,520 --> 00:18:29,360
"It's free food so today, tomorrow and after that you can gather as much as you want!"

356
00:18:32,420 --> 00:18:35,500
This island is

357
00:18:34,290 --> 00:18:35,490
the best!

358
00:18:35,620 --> 00:18:38,420
Summer holiday is

359
00:18:37,540 --> 00:18:38,420
the best!

360
00:18:38,500 --> 00:18:41,060
There's nothing more to say!

361
00:18:42,800 --> 00:18:46,850
"This island is like a magical paradise..."

362
00:18:47,510 --> 00:18:53,290
But the absolute worst conclusion is awaiting a completely oblivious Nasubi!

363
00:18:54,180 --> 00:18:58,630
Nasbi is enjoying summer holiday on the same deserted island as R-Mania

364
00:18:58,820 --> 00:19:01,720
Summer holiday is

365
00:19:00,620 --> 00:19:01,720
the best!

366
00:19:02,250 --> 00:19:06,420
"This summer holiday isn't over yet! The island still has alot to offer!"

367
00:19:07,260 --> 00:19:08,530
That's when!

368
00:19:09,030 --> 00:19:11,510
A boat appears!

369
00:19:13,130 --> 00:19:16,550
Its the staff boat arriving to see how Nasubi is doing!

370
00:19:18,540 --> 00:19:20,260
How's the holiday?

371
00:19:21,870 --> 00:19:24,990
No matter how you look at it... It's great!

372
00:19:25,280 --> 00:19:26,810
Summer holiday is the best!

373
00:19:27,440 --> 00:19:28,790
That's when Nasubi...

374
00:19:28,850 --> 00:19:30,850
It's okay to stay a little longer right?

375
00:19:30,850 --> 00:19:32,320
Sure

376
00:19:32,880 --> 00:19:37,970
But after this, the staff will tell Nasubi something that will instantly change his attitude!

377
00:19:38,560 --> 00:19:40,960
During your summer holiday...

378
00:19:40,960 --> 00:19:43,040
What will you do if you win something?

379
00:19:44,300 --> 00:19:45,520
Huh?!

380
00:19:45,900 --> 00:19:48,160
Isn't someone caring for it?

381
00:19:48,630 --> 00:19:49,730
What do you mean?

382
00:19:51,000 --> 00:19:56,860
Well, er.. for example, one of the staff takes my place in the room...

383
00:19:56,860 --> 00:20:02,340
When the postman comes, they can receive it and say 'oh, thank you'...

384
00:20:03,350 --> 00:20:04,710
We never considered it.

385
00:20:07,890 --> 00:20:09,250
What if I won a car though?!

386
00:20:09,350 --> 00:20:12,810
This is no time to be casually laying around!

387
00:20:12,990 --> 00:20:14,640
We have to get back right now!

388
00:20:14,990 --> 00:20:15,650
But what about summer holiday?

389
00:20:15,650 --> 00:20:17,140
I don't need that shit at all!

390
00:20:17,460 --> 00:20:18,830
Nasubi's summer holiday...

391
00:20:18,830 --> 00:20:21,660
Only a one night stay!

392
00:20:21,800 --> 00:20:27,510
Please support Nasubi @hamatsutomoaki he now a charity fund raiser from Fukushima

393
00:20:21,800 --> 00:20:27,510
