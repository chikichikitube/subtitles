The Future Century
Squadron: The Five Rangai!

2
00:00:04,960 --> 00:00:09,240
You know, I haven't got it yet.
- What?

3
00:00:09,600 --> 00:00:14,840
My period. Already a week late.
- Don't tell me it's that jerk.

4
00:00:15,380 --> 00:00:20,150
Don't even think about it.
- I really don't know what to do.

5
00:00:20,160 --> 00:00:23,260
There's not such thing as a happy
life of a single mother.

6
00:00:24,420 --> 00:00:25,480
Yes.

7
00:00:25,700 --> 00:00:27,800
Good evening.

8
00:00:28,280 --> 00:00:30,400
Ryoko-chan, glad to see you again.

9
00:00:30,540 --> 00:00:33,680
We were talking something important.
- Shut up. I need to talk to her.

10
00:00:33,680 --> 00:00:38,400
Ryoko-chan, do you... ouch!
- He's calling you.

11
00:00:38,400 --> 00:00:41,240
Ryoko-chan, do you wanna take a sale?

12
00:00:42,040 --> 00:00:43,640
You don't have tendency
to get seasick, do you?

13
00:00:43,640 --> 00:00:45,700
I said he's calling!
- I know!

14
00:00:45,700 --> 00:00:49,320
It's a deal then. But I must tell you
the ship rock very hard.

15
00:00:49,350 --> 00:00:51,780
It's a date, alright?
- I said he's knocking for you!

16
00:00:52,320 --> 00:00:54,840
Help! Heeeelp!

17
00:00:55,420 --> 00:00:57,380
Stop!

18
00:00:59,520 --> 00:01:03,080
I'm fighting back in tears!
Red Rangai!

19
00:01:05,400 --> 00:01:10,240
Oh, he's gone!
Blue Rangai!

20
00:01:12,260 --> 00:01:14,780
I will go into morning!
Yellow Rangai!

21
00:01:17,460 --> 00:01:20,420
So sad!
Green Rangai!

22
00:01:21,100 --> 00:01:22,420
Our powers combined!

23
00:01:22,420 --> 00:01:23,640
The Five Rangai!

24
00:01:24,820 --> 00:01:27,340
Ladies, run.

25
00:01:30,840 --> 00:01:35,680
Bring it on!
- You are the one to be blamed.

26
00:01:36,220 --> 00:01:42,800
Wait. What happened?
Did he...

27
00:01:46,780 --> 00:01:47,820
When?

28
00:01:49,880 --> 00:01:52,180
What is... a farewell note?

29
00:01:53,080 --> 00:01:54,320
My brother!

30
00:01:56,660 --> 00:01:59,960
You and Pink are brothers?

31
00:02:00,800 --> 00:02:02,860
He's my big brother.

32
00:02:07,160 --> 00:02:08,120
Dear Dokuro-san.

33
00:02:09,280 --> 00:02:13,060
I have no brains to understand
what you say.

34
00:02:13,400 --> 00:02:19,000
I can't figure out what to do.
I don't know which way to go.

35
00:02:19,000 --> 00:02:24,720
So,  Goodbye.
Yours. Pink Fighter.

36
00:02:28,460 --> 00:02:29,380
Bring it... on.

37
00:02:29,660 --> 00:02:30,820
Our powers combined!

38
00:02:30,820 --> 00:02:32,820
The Five Rangai!

39
00:02:33,300 --> 00:02:35,440
What are you doing that for?

40
00:02:36,300 --> 00:02:39,980
You can't make 5 Rangai without him.
Take your seat there.

41
00:02:44,240 --> 00:02:51,100
It was... 4,5 days ago, his brother, Pink...

42
00:02:51,460 --> 00:02:57,660
Wasn't there any of you with him?
Nobody could stop him?

43
00:02:58,740 --> 00:03:02,820
He died because of... HIM!

44
00:03:04,340 --> 00:03:06,860
What's this all about?
- Stop it!

45
00:03:07,020 --> 00:03:09,020
He killed him.
- That's not true!

46
00:03:09,260 --> 00:03:12,460
Dokuro-san aways valued him highly.

47
00:03:12,460 --> 00:03:16,200
I knew he was working hard.
- They were just jealous of him!

48
00:03:16,760 --> 00:03:20,760
They bullied him every night.
- Stop! That's enough!

49
00:03:22,240 --> 00:03:25,480
You're having a split?

50
00:03:25,760 --> 00:03:27,160
Don't listen to what he's saying.

51
00:03:27,420 --> 00:03:29,720
You must be really surprised.

52
00:03:32,660 --> 00:03:39,080
He's so devoted he doesn't know
what he's saying. - I understand that.

53
00:03:39,980 --> 00:03:44,760
Crying and mourning for him
won't get us anywhere.

54
00:03:45,060 --> 00:03:48,580
So we came here, for him.

55
00:03:49,160 --> 00:03:52,740
And we found this very lively man
to put in his place.

56
00:03:53,280 --> 00:03:58,180
We know 4 of us wouldn't work.

57
00:03:58,620 --> 00:04:00,440
What's wrong with 4 of us?

58
00:04:02,240 --> 00:04:05,660
He's so upset.

59
00:04:05,880 --> 00:04:08,560
Please, just fight with us.
- What?

60
00:04:09,500 --> 00:04:12,540
Please.
- No, I can't.

61
00:04:12,780 --> 00:04:17,940
No. I can't hit someone
so dispirited like you guys.

62
00:04:19,300 --> 00:04:21,720
Don't let yourself down so much.
What?

63
00:04:22,240 --> 00:04:28,420
I didn't mean to attack.
Keep your spirit up, ok?

64
00:04:31,160 --> 00:04:33,500
Are you guys alright?
I sense a lot of hostility in his eyes.

65
00:04:34,940 --> 00:04:38,960
I'm sure he'll understand once
we have a talk.

66
00:04:39,420 --> 00:04:48,120
I'm sorry we can't carry on.
We came here just to inform you.

67
00:04:48,780 --> 00:04:51,220
We have to pick ourselves
and start again. - Right.

68
00:04:51,420 --> 00:04:54,800
I promise we'll do everything to
make you satisfied next week.

69
00:04:55,080 --> 00:04:58,060
Don't take it so hard, ok?

70
00:05:02,340 --> 00:05:06,040
I know it's hard but,
don't let yourself down.

71
00:05:10,520 --> 00:05:12,620
It's natural, though.

72
00:05:14,820 --> 00:05:17,160
Take care of yourselves.
- Thank you.

73
00:05:18,760 --> 00:05:21,940
See you.
- Goodbye.

74
00:05:22,540 --> 00:05:27,960
The Future Century Squadron: The Five Rangai!   To be con't.
