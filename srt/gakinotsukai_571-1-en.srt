3
00:00:04,890 --> 00:00:10,610
The most humiliating batsu game has been delivered to Matsumoto

4
00:00:10,610 --> 00:00:11,920
So...

5
00:00:12,810 --> 00:00:18,800
Matsumoto Batsu Game:

6
00:00:12,810 --> 00:00:19,210
Lonely 2 days and 1 night Haunted Hotel

7
00:00:19,950 --> 00:00:25,040
In this batsu, Matsumoto has to face his inner fears.

8
00:00:25,090 --> 00:00:30,330
In the Haunted hotel, he will have to face all
The Challenges that have been layed out for him.

9
00:00:30,450 --> 00:00:35,210
Only Matsumoto knows his own destiny.

10
00:00:42,190 --> 00:00:44,760
In the year of 1999,

11
00:00:44,760 --> 00:00:51,400
Matsumoto VS Team Hamada
100m running team match.

12
00:00:49,940 --> 00:00:54,080
Hamada's team lost to Matsumoto, so...

13
00:00:54,360 --> 00:00:59,900
Team Hamada had to face a 24 hour tag batsu.

14
00:01:01,770 --> 00:01:09,160
This was one of the harshest Penalty Batsu's ever held in the history of Gaki no Tsukai.

15
00:01:13,150 --> 00:01:14,900
So, Then the following year...

16
00:01:15,510 --> 00:01:21,280
In 2001 team Hamada tries to take revenge on Matsumoto by doing a 50m swimming race.

17
00:01:28,600 --> 00:01:35,470
First Swimmer: Hosei Yamasaki

18
00:01:35,500 --> 00:01:43,700
Second Swimmer:
Cocorikos' Naoki Tanaka

19
00:01:46,000 --> 00:01:54,000
Third Swimmer:
Cocoricos' Shozo Endo

20
00:01:57,700 --> 00:02:04,000
Fourth Swimmer:
Masatoshi Hamada

21
00:02:15,900 --> 00:02:18,740
Team Hamada wins an easy victory.

22
00:02:18,790 --> 00:02:23,240
And are finally able to take revenge on Matsumoto.

23
00:02:23,340 --> 00:02:27,190
By losing, Matsumoto had to take part in a batsu game.

24
00:02:27,390 --> 00:02:31,090
Team Hamada takes preparations for revenge.

25
00:02:31,530 --> 00:02:32,730
-Shall we?
-OK, let's go.

26
00:02:36,930 --> 00:02:41,360
And now Matsumoto finds out what
the other four have prepared for him.

27
00:02:41,930 --> 00:02:43,950
-Yamasaki?
-Yes!

28
00:02:44,180 --> 00:02:45,570
Matsumoto: What are you shouting for?

29
00:02:45,660 --> 00:02:48,140
-Give him the booklet!

30
00:02:46,430 --> 00:02:48,490
-Ok, here you go but first...

31
00:02:48,690 --> 00:02:50,470
-Ok.

32
00:02:48,690 --> 00:02:50,470
-Please read this.

33
00:02:52,450 --> 00:02:54,380
"Matsumoto Hitoshi, Batsu Game...

34
00:02:54,770 --> 00:02:56,270
.. Haunted House?"

35
00:02:56,430 --> 00:02:58,380
Hai-ryokan Ippatsu futsuka (Instead of Ippaku)

36
00:02:58,350 --> 00:03:01,940
"Matsumoto misreads "Ippaku" and says "Ippatsu" instead.

37
00:02:59,780 --> 00:03:00,940
One night and two days

38
00:03:00,940 --> 00:03:02,790
Yes, that's right.

39
00:03:02,810 --> 00:03:03,600
What is this?

40
00:03:03,600 --> 00:03:06,560
We have written the schedule of the batsu down for you.

41
00:03:06,760 --> 00:03:08,860
It's a tentative schedule

42
00:03:08,890 --> 00:03:12,370
It looks like a fun night with many activities planned for you

43
00:03:12,700 --> 00:03:14,610
Well, it looks good so far

44
00:03:14,610 --> 00:03:15,240
Don't be putting it away

45
00:03:15,620 --> 00:03:17,390
You need to take this with you

46
00:03:17,440 --> 00:03:19,430
Let me explain why it's "Haunted Hotel"

47
00:03:19,440 --> 00:03:20,980
Rumor has it that the

48
00:03:20,980 --> 00:03:29,520
previous worker has committed suicide at this hotel a couple of years ago

49
00:03:30,060 --> 00:03:31,430
You gotta be kidding me

50
00:03:33,030 --> 00:03:35,230
I really can't deal with these ghost spirits

51
00:03:35,230 --> 00:03:37,360
I've heard something similar, too

52
00:03:37,360 --> 00:03:39,180
I heard one of the territorial lord back then

53
00:03:39,180 --> 00:03:41,750
had his fortress nearby this hotel

54
00:03:41,750 --> 00:03:44,360
and also many fallen warriors are known to roam around there

55
00:03:44,660 --> 00:03:47,490
It's called the "Alleyway of the ghost sprits"

56
00:03:44,780 --> 00:03:48,370
Alleyway of the ghost spirits

57
00:03:48,380 --> 00:03:50,890
And why the hell do I have to spend the night there ?

58
00:03:50,890 --> 00:03:53,070
Well, this is your Batsu Game this year

59
00:03:54,250 --> 00:03:55,740
Well...

60
00:03:59,040 --> 00:04:00,700
Why call it the "Game" ??

61
00:04:00,980 --> 00:04:03,040
Let's look up this word

62
00:04:03,040 --> 00:04:05,360
I'm gonna go out on the limb to say that the "Game"

63
00:04:05,730 --> 00:04:08,120
should mean something upbeat and fun

64
00:04:08,120 --> 00:04:09,690
I just might be right about that

65
00:04:10,000 --> 00:04:13,220
But this is clearly nothing more than the "Batsu"

66
00:04:12,260 --> 00:04:14,530
BATSU

67
00:04:15,370 --> 00:04:16,840
Don't worry about that

68
00:04:16,840 --> 00:04:18,960
Besides, look at all these fun activities planned for you

69
00:04:19,410 --> 00:04:21,200
Look at them all

70
00:04:21,200 --> 00:04:23,100
You get to do some Karaoke before the fireworks

71
00:04:23,420 --> 00:04:25,160
Look, you get to even go for a nice walk

72
00:04:25,160 --> 00:04:26,460
Wait a minute

73
00:04:27,270 --> 00:04:29,060
I'm already hating this

74
00:04:29,060 --> 00:04:29,740
Seriously...

75
00:04:30,260 --> 00:04:32,280
I'll be all by myself, right ?

76
00:04:32,320 --> 00:04:33,090
Yes, you'll be alone

77
00:04:33,100 --> 00:04:36,110
This just doesn't look like a fun time

78
00:04:36,520 --> 00:04:37,890
Straight up

79
00:04:38,780 --> 00:04:39,810
Yes, you'll be alone

80
00:04:41,260 --> 00:04:43,730
What am I, Rentaro Mikuni ??

81
00:04:43,360 --> 00:04:47,190
*Rentaro Mikuni is an actor

82
00:04:43,730 --> 00:04:47,210
Well, I don't know if Mr. Mikuni is like this but...

83
00:04:47,960 --> 00:04:49,350
Well, we should get going

84
00:04:48,880 --> 00:04:51,120
Well, we should get going

85
00:04:50,040 --> 00:04:50,850
Good luck !

86
00:04:51,180 --> 00:04:52,060
Good luck, sir

87
00:04:52,780 --> 00:04:53,930
See you

88
00:04:53,960 --> 00:04:55,020
Wish you luck

89
00:04:58,020 --> 00:05:00,050
And...

90
00:05:10,320 --> 00:05:12,120
Well, well, well

91
00:05:13,900 --> 00:05:15,790
You give such a nice greetings

92
00:05:16,070 --> 00:05:18,000
I've always done this

93
00:05:18,000 --> 00:05:18,840
Really, are you always this polite ?

94
00:05:18,840 --> 00:05:21,170
Of course, I'm always like this

95
00:05:22,730 --> 00:05:23,950
Thank you so much for coming today

96
00:05:23,940 --> 00:05:25,130
Thank you very much

97
00:05:25,130 --> 00:05:26,360
Thank you all

98
00:05:28,030 --> 00:05:29,370
You might have already figured this out

99
00:05:29,370 --> 00:05:30,840
after seeing the four of us,

100
00:05:30,860 --> 00:05:33,060
about what we'll be showing you today

101
00:05:37,070 --> 00:05:39,380
We're showing the Matsumoto's Batsu Game

102
00:05:40,670 --> 00:05:43,040
It is finally here

103
00:05:43,120 --> 00:05:45,570
We did it

104
00:05:43,780 --> 00:05:45,080
Yes, we did

105
00:05:45,790 --> 00:05:47,700
He was such a wimp throughout the game

106
00:05:47,700 --> 00:05:48,290
Honestly

107
00:05:48,270 --> 00:05:51,360
We can't find anyone more wimpy than him

108
00:05:51,360 --> 00:05:53,490
I'm certainly no more wimpy than him

109
00:05:53,490 --> 00:05:55,580
You might be right after seeing him

110
00:05:56,390 --> 00:05:57,940
Without further adieu,

111
00:05:57,970 --> 00:06:00,340
why not bring the guest of honor ?

112
00:06:00,950 --> 00:06:03,090
Here he is

113
00:06:04,690 --> 00:06:06,340
Wimp !

114
00:06:16,450 --> 00:06:18,040
Let me just say a couple of things

115
00:06:18,040 --> 00:06:19,980
First of all,

116
00:06:19,980 --> 00:06:22,490
Why am I the only one so formal ?

117
00:06:22,500 --> 00:06:24,040
You're right

118
00:06:24,430 --> 00:06:26,270
What's with you guys though

119
00:06:26,330 --> 00:06:29,030
Like a street gangs

120
00:06:29,210 --> 00:06:30,930
Seriously

121
00:06:30,930 --> 00:06:32,530
But this is your day

122
00:06:32,530 --> 00:06:34,380
I understand that I'm the star but...

123
00:06:34,380 --> 00:06:36,320
I hear this will be a long one...

124
00:06:37,040 --> 00:06:38,580
It'll be a long night

125
00:06:38,580 --> 00:06:42,710
Of course since it went from 8pm to the next morning at 8am

126
00:06:46,710 --> 00:06:48,800
And he was in it the whole time

127
00:06:48,800 --> 00:06:50,060
The whole time

128
00:06:50,060 --> 00:06:52,330
he would get scared like this at every little things

129
00:06:52,380 --> 00:06:53,510
Like this?

130
00:06:53,530 --> 00:06:54,770
You know what ?

131
00:06:54,770 --> 00:06:56,900
the next morning

132
00:06:56,900 --> 00:06:58,320
my neck was killing me right here

133
00:06:58,320 --> 00:07:00,530
Because I was being jumpy all night

134
00:07:00,530 --> 00:07:02,800
I'm going "Ahh" like this the whole night

135
00:07:02,800 --> 00:07:04,340
You must've been jumpy all night

136
00:07:04,340 --> 00:07:07,540
I couldn't turn my head when I was shooting this other show

137
00:07:07,540 --> 00:07:09,650
You know what else with him ?

138
00:07:10,140 --> 00:07:13,050
He literally got scared at everything we had set up

139
00:07:13,070 --> 00:07:14,330
You were like "Ahhh"

140
00:07:14,330 --> 00:07:17,920
at every single one of our tricks

141
00:07:19,400 --> 00:07:21,180
Just remember this before we show you the tape

142
00:07:21,180 --> 00:07:22,690
We could not fail

143
00:07:22,720 --> 00:07:23,960
"OK, try this"

144
00:07:23,960 --> 00:07:25,700
He'd be like Ahh !!

145
00:07:25,700 --> 00:07:27,040
He fell for everything

146
00:07:27,430 --> 00:07:32,240
In this batsu game Matsumoto has to spend two days and one night at a hotel..

147
00:07:32,280 --> 00:07:39,400
...far from civilization and any nearby living people or roads.

148
00:07:40,710 --> 00:07:47,620
The hotel is located on a hillside, 45 miles from the closest town.

149
00:07:48,150 --> 00:07:55,800
Causing that Matsumoto arrives after the sun has gone down.

150
00:07:55,800 --> 00:07:59,640
Matsumoto will have to enter the hotel shrouded in darkness.

151
00:08:01,990 --> 00:08:08,520
7:30 The car, with Matsumoto, stops in front of the hotel.

152
00:08:14,510 --> 00:08:17,740
Automated cameras have been set up inside and outside the hotel.

153
00:08:17,800 --> 00:08:24,190
and except for a few technicians and staff members, there's nobody else here.

154
00:08:24,620 --> 00:08:29,880
The rest of the staff are working from another building at a distance away.

155
00:08:29,970 --> 00:08:33,470
He approaches the entrance of the hotel where he has to face his darkest fears.

156
00:08:33,730 --> 00:08:36,220
You were so ready to spend the night there

157
00:08:38,360 --> 00:08:40,250
It gives you the chills, doesn't it?

158
00:08:40,250 --> 00:08:41,000
Ah, Kowai, Kowai!

159
00:08:40,250 --> 00:08:42,920
"Kowai" here means "scary", Endo says, "Scary scary"
It sounds kinda.. you know..

160
00:08:41,810 --> 00:08:44,160
That's what makes it funny...

161
00:08:53,730 --> 00:08:57,260
...I really wouldn't spend the night there!

162
00:08:58,800 --> 00:09:01,750
How creepy is this place ?

163
00:09:19,470 --> 00:09:21,510
What kind of creepy drawing is that ?

164
00:09:29,820 --> 00:09:33,650
The hotel consists of an old and a new building.

165
00:09:33,650 --> 00:09:38,080
Matsumoto's room is on the 2nd floor of the old building.

166
00:09:41,680 --> 00:09:43,660
You wanted the AC on, huh ?

167
00:09:44,360 --> 00:09:48,070
Fujiwara

168
00:09:47,110 --> 00:09:48,820
Excuse me...

169
00:09:51,170 --> 00:09:54,000
Thank you for staying at our hotel.

170
00:09:54,210 --> 00:09:54,990
Yeah.

171
00:09:54,990 --> 00:09:59,360
I will be your host this evening.

172
00:09:59,730 --> 00:10:03,670
They call me Fujiwara the Manager

173
00:10:04,550 --> 00:10:09,280
How do you like the room so far?

174
00:10:07,240 --> 00:10:09,330
I hate it...

175
00:10:09,330 --> 00:10:11,020
...and what's with that picture?

176
00:10:11,020 --> 00:10:13,020
Ha, you're being funny right now

177
00:10:14,280 --> 00:10:17,170
That's just creepy

178
00:10:17,170 --> 00:10:18,460
...Yes

179
00:10:18,510 --> 00:10:21,160
I'll be leaving then...

180
00:10:21,420 --> 00:10:22,780
Sure

181
00:10:22,780 --> 00:10:25,420
Uhm...Matsumoto-san..

182
00:10:23,590 --> 00:10:25,460
What do you want?

183
00:10:25,770 --> 00:10:28,040
Well... Uhm...

184
00:10:28,040 --> 00:10:31,440
I was wondering if I could get... a tip or something...

185
00:10:31,840 --> 00:10:37,080
Sorry, I didn't bring my wallet with me.

186
00:10:38,390 --> 00:10:41,400
I see... I'll excuse myself now.

187
00:10:46,730 --> 00:10:48,930
I'm looking forward to being of service

188
00:10:52,690 --> 00:10:54,930
I should change

189
00:11:15,110 --> 00:11:18,620
Hello, we've prepared your dinner,

190
00:11:18,620 --> 00:11:20,630
..please come to the main hall now.

191
00:11:20,630 --> 00:11:21,180
Main hall?

192
00:11:21,180 --> 00:11:25,060
Yes, there are arrows pointing the directions..

193
00:11:25,060 --> 00:11:28,250
.. please follow them.

194
00:11:28,350 --> 00:11:28,890
Yes.

195
00:11:32,250 --> 00:11:33,500
Why can't they serve it in here ?

196
00:11:34,210 --> 00:11:35,690
Why do I have to leave my room?

197
00:11:37,320 --> 00:11:39,610
First event: Dinner

198
00:11:40,320 --> 00:11:46,280
The main hall is located on the 2nd floor of the new building

199
00:11:47,690 --> 00:11:56,320
A scary sound in the hallway

200
00:11:49,280 --> 00:11:56,320
Jack-in-a-box

201
00:11:51,320 --> 00:11:56,320
A secret guest

202
00:11:52,790 --> 00:11:56,320
A fart cushion

203
00:11:56,920 --> 00:12:00,060
A spider web

204
00:12:10,190 --> 00:12:13,610
Countdown to the noise

205
00:12:20,730 --> 00:12:23,160
Of COURSE you'll get scared!

206
00:12:24,950 --> 00:12:27,270
[Hamada]: You're so easy to scare.

207
00:12:32,030 --> 00:12:34,660
So deserted~~

208
00:12:34,970 --> 00:12:37,040
[Matsumoto]:I was definitely deserted

209
00:12:37,030 --> 00:12:39,000
[Endo]: This was a hard one right?

210
00:12:42,480 --> 00:12:44,660
[Matsumoto]: It definitely was a hard one!

211
00:12:50,590 --> 00:12:51,970
Okay, let's eat.

212
00:12:50,900 --> 00:12:54,400
Countdown to the Jack-in-the-box

213
00:12:59,690 --> 00:13:02,680
Miserable Matsumoto can do nothing but laugh.

214
00:13:06,900 --> 00:13:08,490
[Hamada]:That was stupid...

215
00:13:14,240 --> 00:13:17,370
It came out of my MAIN dish:(

216
00:13:22,420 --> 00:13:24,500
...and the food was bad...

217
00:13:25,610 --> 00:13:27,870
...I guess nothing would taste good there.

218
00:13:27,450 --> 00:13:31,230
Countdown to the Secret Guest

219
00:13:39,680 --> 00:13:41,820
Good evening.

220
00:13:42,910 --> 00:13:46,430
This is Tsuno Dajirou, known as one of the top
graphic comic author in Japan.

221
00:13:46,430 --> 00:13:53,910
He's also known to have extensive knowledge about
the paranormal photography

222
00:13:54,780 --> 00:13:57,040
You know, let me tell you something...

223
00:13:57,150 --> 00:14:02,110
15 years ago, I was researching this hotel and the area around it.

224
00:14:03,290 --> 00:14:04,710
In that time..

225
00:14:06,290 --> 00:14:09,590
I made some paranormal photographs...

226
00:14:09,830 --> 00:14:14,330
and this photo is taken at the entrance of this hotel, but..

227
00:14:14,860 --> 00:14:17,540
Is this where you entered?

228
00:14:18,160 --> 00:14:19,740
Yes, this is where I entered.

229
00:14:20,400 --> 00:14:23,980
You can see something in this picture, can you?

230
00:14:24,770 --> 00:14:26,670
Wha..what is this?

231
00:14:26,670 --> 00:14:29,430
This..looks like someone's head, doesn't it?

232
00:14:30,410 --> 00:14:31,590
Can you see it?

233
00:14:32,980 --> 00:14:34,400
This is a fake picture taken by the staff.

234
00:14:34,400 --> 00:14:35,910
What is that?

235
00:14:36,380 --> 00:14:38,360
I think it is someone's face.

236
00:14:39,650 --> 00:14:42,990
After that, I wanted to let the ghost out, but..

237
00:14:43,490 --> 00:14:44,820
Sadly speaking..

238
00:14:45,500 --> 00:14:50,800
the person did not have enough powers to expel it, so it escaped.

239
00:14:51,400 --> 00:14:51,830
ya..

240
00:14:51,830 --> 00:14:54,460
So the ghosts are still here.

241
00:14:54,940 --> 00:14:57,070
So, in fact..and I don't know how to say it uh...

242
00:14:57,780 --> 00:14:59,460
It may be by accident, but...

243
00:14:59,460 --> 00:15:02,640
you guys are recording this TV show in the wrong place...

244
00:15:03,440 --> 00:15:08,650
*This is a lie to make
Matsumoto terrified.

245
00:15:04,630 --> 00:15:07,500
So, do you believe in ghosts?

246
00:15:08,190 --> 00:15:09,910
Hmmm...no...

247
00:15:10,430 --> 00:15:13,620
- You don't want to believe, right?

248
00:15:11,330 --> 00:15:13,620
- Yes, I don't want to.

249
00:15:13,920 --> 00:15:16,050
But...they ARE real.

250
00:15:18,600 --> 00:15:20,700
Have you ever seen this kind of photo?

251
00:15:23,280 --> 00:15:26,460
Look, he doesn't have a head.

252
00:15:30,150 --> 00:15:34,230
- The shadow doesn't have one either, see?

253
00:15:32,470 --> 00:15:35,230
Man's head is missing

254
00:15:35,980 --> 00:15:37,350
Well..

255
00:15:38,540 --> 00:15:41,780
I heard that this hotel was open until a year ago.

256
00:15:42,160 --> 00:15:43,040
ya

257
00:15:43,190 --> 00:15:45,070
But...not at that moment...

258
00:15:45,600 --> 00:15:47,760
Speaking of the reason...

259
00:15:48,030 --> 00:15:52,230
When the hotel opened, one of the guest woman committed suicide by hanging herself...

260
00:15:52,650 --> 00:15:55,660
IN HERE.

261
00:15:56,580 --> 00:15:57,870
Also..

262
00:15:57,470 --> 00:16:02,940
*This is another lie to make
him even more terrified.

263
00:16:00,620 --> 00:16:04,430
And since then, the number of guests have been decreasing.

264
00:16:06,230 --> 00:16:07,900
- Ok

265
00:16:06,930 --> 00:16:07,830
- Ya

266
00:16:07,920 --> 00:16:11,710
In the end, the hotel had to close and go out of business.

267
00:16:14,840 --> 00:16:16,020
I heard you were staying here....

268
00:16:16,080 --> 00:16:17,660
Do you best tonight,

269
00:16:17,870 --> 00:16:20,510
...and please be careful.

270
00:16:22,500 --> 00:16:24,490
[Hamada]: How can he leave like that?

271
00:16:24,560 --> 00:16:27,020
[Endo]: That guy is can be very persuasive.

272
00:16:27,560 --> 00:16:30,780
Completely depressed Matsumoto

273
00:16:31,700 --> 00:16:33,470
[Yamasaki]: So that's how it is.

274
00:16:36,880 --> 00:16:38,210
[Endo]: He didn't even finish his dinner.

275
00:16:43,110 --> 00:16:46,080
Super-Sensitive !

276
00:16:50,350 --> 00:16:53,590
He seems to have lost his appetite.

277
00:16:55,020 --> 00:16:58,330
Countdown to the noise

278
00:17:17,160 --> 00:17:20,280
[Hamada]:It's that fart cushion!

279
00:17:35,730 --> 00:17:37,130
Give me a break already...

280
00:17:45,840 --> 00:17:49,780
*A puzzle with cute little puppies,


Matsumoto seems interested*

281
00:17:52,270 --> 00:17:55,310
[Matsumoto]:I didn't have anything better to do.

282
00:18:00,490 --> 00:18:03,530
Hello, We've prepared a hot bath in the onsen for you...

283
00:18:04,140 --> 00:18:07,740
Please follow the arrows.

284
00:18:20,230 --> 00:18:21,660
9:00pm
Onsen time!

285
00:18:23,050 --> 00:18:27,660
To get to the onsen, Matsumoto must take
the suspended passage way,

286
00:18:27,710 --> 00:18:32,400
Go down the stairs and through the garden.

287
00:18:34,190 --> 00:18:41,160
Japanese doll at stairs

288
00:18:35,760 --> 00:18:41,160
Noise from the window of changing room

289
00:18:37,490 --> 00:18:41,160
Visitor at the bath house

290
00:18:39,130 --> 00:18:41,160
Another Fart Cushion upon returning to the room

291
00:18:41,160 --> 00:18:45,400
Japanese Doll

292
00:18:57,390 --> 00:18:58,850
It's dark in here

293
00:18:57,960 --> 00:19:01,450
Sudden sound in

294
00:19:10,460 --> 00:19:14,390
Cautiously Matsumoto checks


the inside of the locker.

295
00:19:21,430 --> 00:19:26,240
Matsumoto

296
00:19:22,900 --> 00:19:26,270
Countdown to the visitor

297
00:19:26,470 --> 00:19:27,480
Fujiwara knocking on the window.

298
00:19:37,820 --> 00:19:39,820
Shut the hell up !!

299
00:19:44,230 --> 00:19:47,060
How's the water?

300
00:19:47,700 --> 00:19:48,960
Just right, now go away!

301
00:19:48,960 --> 00:19:51,870
Just right, now go away!

302
00:19:56,000 --> 00:20:09,680
I've been married


for a year now!

303
00:19:57,900 --> 00:19:59,030
Eh?

304
00:20:04,950 --> 00:20:07,130
You've been married for a year?

305
00:20:08,000 --> 00:20:10,500
.. What's that got to do with me?

306
00:20:15,600 --> 00:20:19,650
I'm learning how to


cook cold Chinese food

307
00:20:17,210 --> 00:20:19,540
So what?

308
00:20:22,640 --> 00:20:25,150
Your punch line delivery needs more work

309
00:20:25,230 --> 00:20:27,580
Eventually, Matsumoto comes out...

310
00:20:29,050 --> 00:20:31,420
But !

311
00:20:32,120 --> 00:20:34,730
What he didn't know...

312
00:20:36,630 --> 00:20:39,460
While Fujiwara kept Matsumoto busy,

313
00:20:39,460 --> 00:20:44,420
Manager Tashima quietly slipped into the locker

314
00:20:45,190 --> 00:20:46,900
I had no idea he was doing that

315
00:20:53,990 --> 00:20:56,240
Hamada: I'd definitely be scared by this

316
00:21:03,460 --> 00:21:06,890
Countdown to the manager Tashima

317
00:21:13,590 --> 00:21:20,200
Just look at Matsumoto's face!!

318
00:21:21,340 --> 00:21:22,940
I brought you some water.

319
00:21:28,470 --> 00:21:31,480
Tashima returns in the locker


for some reason.

320
00:21:31,380 --> 00:21:32,950
[Hamada]:Why did he go back?!?

321
00:21:37,470 --> 00:21:40,360
[Matsumoto]:You know I had already checked that locker, right ?

322
00:21:42,560 --> 00:21:44,230
What the heck!~

323
00:21:44,860 --> 00:21:51,030
Scary picture from before

324
00:21:52,400 --> 00:21:54,340
GEEZ!~

325
00:22:04,580 --> 00:22:07,280
Fart Cushion

326
00:22:20,630 --> 00:22:24,630
Matsumoto breaks down in self-pity

327
00:22:25,790 --> 00:22:29,760
Meanwhile, Hamada, Endo and Tanaka arrive!

328
00:22:29,760 --> 00:22:35,520
They head straight for the staff HQ with more
nasty pranks in mind!

329
00:22:47,820 --> 00:22:48,670
What now?

330
00:22:50,260 --> 00:22:51,290
Some reporters from the African Channel Television want
to take a quick interview about the batsu game

331
00:22:51,290 --> 00:22:58,510
Some reporters from the African Channel Television want
to take a quick interview

332
00:22:58,510 --> 00:23:01,700
...since this is your first batsu game in 7 years.

333
00:23:01,700 --> 00:23:03,710
There's not much to talk about you know...

334
00:23:03,750 --> 00:23:06,660
In any case, I'll ask them in

335
00:23:10,410 --> 00:23:14,420
African TV Crew

336
00:23:18,550 --> 00:23:20,750
Random dude: OK?
Roll the camera!

337
00:23:20,900 --> 00:23:24,770
This is your first batsu in seven years

338
00:23:24,770 --> 00:23:26,760
..How do you feel about that?

339
00:23:26,760 --> 00:23:46,950
Board: Act funny!

340
00:23:27,040 --> 00:23:29,210
Yeah..uh..

341
00:23:32,740 --> 00:23:34,260
..Yeah, well, I thought it's been 8 years ??

342
00:23:34,260 --> 00:23:36,910
..Yeah, well, I thought it's been 8 years ??

343
00:23:41,720 --> 00:23:49,250
Well, I don't believe I deserve this Batsu Game per se

344
00:23:47,320 --> 00:23:53,520
Random dude gestures
Matsumoto to wrap it up.

345
00:23:53,660 --> 00:23:57,430
What? What do you want me to do?

346
00:23:57,870 --> 00:24:00,040
All right then, next question...ehh..

347
00:24:00,890 --> 00:24:07,660
Do you have plans for another job?

348
00:24:07,660 --> 00:24:10,370
No, not at all

349
00:24:09,940 --> 00:24:20,520
Act funny!! (again)

350
00:24:16,190 --> 00:24:20,530
This job is all I need.

351
00:24:20,880 --> 00:24:24,790
Random dude gestures
Matsumoto to elaborate

352
00:24:27,860 --> 00:24:31,960
If the opportunity presents itself, I'll think about it

353
00:24:31,980 --> 00:24:35,140
I'm happy to hear that.

354
00:24:35,140 --> 00:24:37,150
On a more personal note,
how much money do you have saved ?

355
00:24:37,150 --> 00:24:40,140
On a more personal note,
how much money do you have saved ?

356
00:24:41,240 --> 00:24:52,580
Be serious this time!!

357
00:24:48,180 --> 00:24:50,100
Uhm, this is a private matter, so...

358
00:24:50,100 --> 00:24:51,910
Uhm, this is a private matter, so...

359
00:24:51,910 --> 00:24:57,200
Uhm, this is a private matter, so...

360
00:24:52,940 --> 00:24:58,610
Random dude: Wrap it up !

361
00:24:58,460 --> 00:24:59,810
That's it then

362
00:24:59,810 --> 00:25:01,340
Thank you for your time

363
00:25:01,340 --> 00:25:02,690
Alright, we got it !

364
00:25:03,890 --> 00:25:05,560
Huh ?

365
00:25:08,130 --> 00:25:09,600
What the hell ?

366
00:25:11,900 --> 00:25:15,140
Countdown to the painting falling

367
00:25:40,500 --> 00:25:43,160
Why does it have to be so scary?!?

368
00:25:43,460 --> 00:25:48,760
At the staff HQ, Hamada and Tanaka were already cooking up a new plan.

369
00:25:49,400 --> 00:25:56,080
Whenever someone hits the door,
Matsumoto gets all "WoaHh"and stuff!

370
00:26:04,040 --> 00:26:07,140
Countdown to the bang on the wall

371
00:26:11,220 --> 00:26:13,870
[Hamada]:You just stretched the hell out of yourself

372
00:26:15,560 --> 00:26:17,570
What the hell!?

373
00:26:20,700 --> 00:26:24,040
Countdown to another bang

374
00:26:31,010 --> 00:26:32,480
Shut the hell up !!

375
00:26:32,880 --> 00:26:36,330
The three look very pleased

376
00:26:40,050 --> 00:26:41,990
He jumped twice.

377
00:26:44,650 --> 00:26:49,040
But Hamada wants more...

378
00:26:49,040 --> 00:26:52,280
He explains his next strategy without mercy!

379
00:26:52,280 --> 00:26:56,300
Fujiwara should come into his room, hit his head and get out of there.

380
00:26:58,560 --> 00:27:02,060
Countdown to Fujiwara attack

381
00:27:18,690 --> 00:27:22,010
What happened to the ghost and spirits ??

382
00:27:22,000 --> 00:27:25,380
He must be feeling the humiliation now

383
00:27:26,010 --> 00:27:28,270
Yeah, pretty hard.

384
00:27:37,710 --> 00:27:43,300
Matsumoto, why don't you sing a song in the karaoke to get away from everyday's stress?

385
00:27:43,570 --> 00:27:49,260
We've got it ready for you, so please come to the main hall once again.

386
00:27:53,390 --> 00:27:54,860
I don't want to~

387
00:27:56,010 --> 00:27:57,980
10pm:
Karaoke time!

388
00:27:58,890 --> 00:28:06,460
This time's mysterious phenomenon: Tajima Manager wearing the Japanese armor will begin to move when Matsumoto starts singing.

389
00:28:04,560 --> 00:28:06,460
Can he conquer this horror?

390
00:28:06,720 --> 00:28:10,210
Landlady Fujiwara

391
00:28:06,720 --> 00:28:10,210
Tajima Manager

392
00:28:12,650 --> 00:28:13,830
I was waiting for you.

393
00:28:14,570 --> 00:28:18,890
This is the laser karaoke.

394
00:28:19,860 --> 00:28:22,420
I already chose a song for you, so you can start soon.

395
00:28:22,620 --> 00:28:23,910
Please come here.

396
00:28:25,740 --> 00:28:28,330
Song: Ashita Ga Aru Sa
(There's Always Tomorrow)

397
00:28:28,400 --> 00:28:30,700
Ehi!

398
00:28:28,900 --> 00:28:30,700
Ehi!

399
00:28:29,530 --> 00:28:30,700
Ehi!

400
00:28:30,130 --> 00:28:30,700
Ehi!

401
00:28:30,740 --> 00:28:34,640
"I always see her at the same train station

402
00:28:35,040 --> 00:28:39,450
The girl with the sailor uniform and the breads in her hair"

403
00:28:37,910 --> 00:28:41,740
Fujiwara leaves the hall to leave Matsumoto alone.

404
00:28:39,940 --> 00:28:42,440
"Its almost time...It’s almost time..."

405
00:28:42,440 --> 00:28:44,760
"Its almost time...It’s almost time..."

406
00:28:42,510 --> 00:28:44,810
For some reason Matsumoto continues singing,


even when left alone.

407
00:28:44,830 --> 00:28:49,640
"but today, I wait again in vain..."

408
00:28:49,660 --> 00:28:52,070
But there is always tomorrow, there is always tomorrow, there is always tomorrow...

409
00:28:52,070 --> 00:28:54,460
But there is always tomorrow, there is always tomorrow, there is always tomorrow...

410
00:28:54,460 --> 00:28:59,160
But there is always tomorrow, there is always tomorrow, there is always tomorrow...

411
00:28:55,720 --> 00:28:59,380
Countdown to
the Tashima Armor movement

412
00:29:04,690 --> 00:29:06,600
Please stop! Really!

413
00:29:07,200 --> 00:29:09,700
I brought you a bottle of water.

414
00:29:21,820 --> 00:29:25,320
Meanwhile, Hamada and Tanaka


hide in Matsumoto's room.

415
00:29:26,400 --> 00:29:30,730
Matsumoto returns to his room...

416
00:29:29,430 --> 00:29:31,910
Nice editing !

417
00:29:35,430 --> 00:29:39,100
Fart Cushion

418
00:29:50,230 --> 00:29:52,580
[Matsumoto]:"I'm no idiot, you know, I can learn"

419
00:29:57,220 --> 00:30:00,490
Countdown to Hamada

420
00:30:07,010 --> 00:30:11,230
LOOK! This is his motion!

421
00:30:18,300 --> 00:30:20,140
OOOH! You scared the hell outta me !

422
00:30:21,500 --> 00:30:23,320
WHAT!?

423
00:30:27,780 --> 00:30:28,780
What?

424
00:30:28,840 --> 00:30:30,580
Here, a present for you.

425
00:30:30,780 --> 00:30:32,010
What's Country Dumpling?

426
00:30:32,010 --> 00:30:34,400
UHm..you need some sweets...

427
00:30:34,400 --> 00:30:36,150
you shouldn't reduce your blood sugar level.

428
00:30:37,200 --> 00:30:38,210
How is it?

429
00:30:41,470 --> 00:30:44,270
You were moving your hands and legs!

430
00:30:45,140 --> 00:30:49,140
Hamada is happy to have surprised Matsumoto.

431
00:30:47,910 --> 00:30:49,160
Are you scared of them?

432
00:30:53,000 --> 00:30:54,450
Were you scared of them?

433
00:30:54,880 --> 00:30:55,790
Were you?

434
00:30:56,060 --> 00:30:57,150
What are you?

435
00:30:57,150 --> 00:30:57,820
I'm just asking to you if you were scared of that.

436
00:30:57,820 --> 00:31:00,210
None of your business, go back!

437
00:31:00,300 --> 00:31:01,440
Why!

438
00:31:01,500 --> 00:31:03,300
What's this?

439
00:31:03,300 --> 00:31:04,610
No, don't ask me about that..

440
00:31:04,610 --> 00:31:05,440
What's this?

441
00:31:05,440 --> 00:31:07,420
No, because it's scary.

442
00:31:07,420 --> 00:31:08,370
Pic?

443
00:31:08,370 --> 00:31:09,030
ya...

444
00:31:09,020 --> 00:31:09,960
Huh

445
00:31:10,050 --> 00:31:12,330
Why is this scary? Is there something on this picture?

446
00:31:12,330 --> 00:31:14,210
I don't know, but I guess so..

447
00:31:14,210 --> 00:31:15,300
eeh, where?

448
00:31:15,310 --> 00:31:18,740
No, not where! You can find it by yourself!

449
00:31:18,930 --> 00:31:20,290
Aah! No more!

450
00:31:20,290 --> 00:31:23,540
You can explain it to me!

451
00:31:20,880 --> 00:31:23,540
I really don't want to see it!

452
00:31:23,630 --> 00:31:26,060
Really?

453
00:31:24,020 --> 00:31:26,060
Yes, no more.

454
00:31:27,330 --> 00:31:29,170
I don't want to see it too.

455
00:31:31,660 --> 00:31:34,660
Hamada is surprised by Matsumoto's fart.

456
00:31:38,890 --> 00:31:41,200
You were just like this, hu!

457
00:31:41,550 --> 00:31:44,450
Are you gonna fly? You fly! Like Hu!

458
00:31:46,280 --> 00:31:48,880
What's with this guy..what's that?

459
00:31:49,340 --> 00:31:50,610
You foolish man!

460
00:31:50,990 --> 00:31:52,530
You can go back, can't you?

461
00:31:52,260 --> 00:31:55,660
Tanaka appearing in...

462
00:31:52,690 --> 00:31:54,460
Nah, I'll still be there.

463
00:32:12,910 --> 00:32:15,750
You were very surprised, huh?

464
00:32:18,070 --> 00:32:19,940
No, not much..no more! It's hot, MOOH!

465
00:32:19,940 --> 00:32:21,830
No, not much..no more! It's hot, MOOH!

466
00:32:23,750 --> 00:32:25,230
What's that?

467
00:32:25,230 --> 00:32:26,600
It's a present for you.

468
00:32:28,800 --> 00:32:29,770
It's a nice present, huh.

469
00:32:29,770 --> 00:32:30,540
Isn't it?

470
00:32:30,540 --> 00:32:31,620
Yea, I think so.

471
00:32:30,740 --> 00:32:34,140
Endo appearing in...

472
00:32:43,010 --> 00:32:47,630
You scared us 10 out of 10! What are you!?!

473
00:32:47,630 --> 00:32:49,340
Yea, he did!

474
00:32:49,370 --> 00:32:51,450
He was caught by all that!!

475
00:32:49,760 --> 00:32:53,900
Listen, who wouldn't be scared in this situation ?

476
00:32:53,900 --> 00:32:57,140
Listen, who wouldn't be scared in this situation ?

477
00:32:57,820 --> 00:33:02,840
10:30PM: Matsumoto's has company now,
but his nerves are still on the edge

478
00:33:05,560 --> 00:33:06,800
I'm sick of it!

479
00:33:06,820 --> 00:33:08,710
We understand.

480
00:33:10,720 --> 00:33:13,680
Tanaka, you appeared very well from the closet, huh?

481
00:33:13,720 --> 00:33:15,500
Yes, because I practiced it SO MUCH!

482
00:33:15,500 --> 00:33:16,970
It's like you..

483
00:33:17,120 --> 00:33:18,820
hey, Hamada is foolish.

484
00:33:18,820 --> 00:33:20,410
He got scared by my fart!

485
00:33:20,410 --> 00:33:23,320
He's not much better than me

486
00:33:24,340 --> 00:33:26,530
I just let out a fart, and he went "Ahhh !"

487
00:33:27,620 --> 00:33:30,440
It's like he's never heard a fart before

488
00:33:32,670 --> 00:33:34,030
Well...really..

489
00:33:34,030 --> 00:33:35,560
What?

490
00:33:35,640 --> 00:33:37,710
Uhm, you know...

491
00:33:37,820 --> 00:33:39,200
I was lonely.

492
00:33:39,200 --> 00:33:40,660
Yea, I can see it.

493
00:33:39,540 --> 00:33:43,540
Matsumoto is actually happy his 3 friends are there.

494
00:33:43,350 --> 00:33:44,550
It's scary here...

495
00:33:44,550 --> 00:33:46,640
Well really...

496
00:33:46,640 --> 00:33:49,460
The telephone is really old..

497
00:33:48,330 --> 00:33:49,440
Yea, scary...

498
00:33:51,750 --> 00:33:55,080
I chose to go to a video rental store,

499
00:33:55,840 --> 00:33:58,910
and what I chose was...uuh..

500
00:33:59,350 --> 00:34:00,480
Well..you know..

501
00:34:00,480 --> 00:34:03,620
The video of "Shining".

502
00:34:04,440 --> 00:34:12,660
The story is about someone staying in a hotel, after season, isn't it? And,

503
00:34:12,660 --> 00:34:18,300
the person in the end gets all crazy. He takes an axe and goes rampaging around the hotel!

504
00:34:18,300 --> 00:34:23,080
So, I thought:"Why did I watch such movie so timely..!"

505
00:34:26,900 --> 00:34:32,260
The guys get pretty surprised by a


sudden sound of a crying woman.

506
00:34:34,780 --> 00:34:37,140
Why do they try to scare us, besides Matsumoto..?

507
00:34:37,140 --> 00:34:39,380
How irritating...

508
00:34:39,920 --> 00:34:42,890
They should stop it, really.

509
00:34:45,740 --> 00:34:48,030
Sometimes, someone kicks at the wall!

510
00:34:48,480 --> 00:34:51,130
And simply, I'm angry at it!

511
00:34:50,260 --> 00:34:54,260
Matsumoto is angry at the prank Hamada thought of

512
00:34:57,840 --> 00:35:03,640
and when I get back here, it seems someone messed up my Tobacco like trash!

513
00:35:03,640 --> 00:35:05,800
These pranks have nothing to do with ghost spirits

514
00:35:07,080 --> 00:35:09,150
They're just annoying

515
00:35:17,970 --> 00:35:22,060
If I were alone, I would be scared to death!

516
00:35:22,060 --> 00:35:23,100
Just, uhm..

517
00:35:23,070 --> 00:35:24,730
what?

518
00:35:24,880 --> 00:35:26,520
What? What?
what?

519
00:35:26,720 --> 00:35:29,280
This can't make anyone laughing...

520
00:35:31,330 --> 00:35:32,210
Look.

521
00:35:32,210 --> 00:35:33,240
Who brought these in ?

522
00:35:33,240 --> 00:35:35,820
You know, there isn't a head on this guy.

523
00:35:35,770 --> 00:35:37,630
His head is gone.

524
00:35:36,830 --> 00:35:38,690
You're kidding..

525
00:35:39,570 --> 00:35:41,480
Moreover...

526
00:35:41,610 --> 00:35:43,360
His shadow is headless too...

527
00:35:43,430 --> 00:35:45,760
That's just too scary..!

528
00:35:45,760 --> 00:35:48,390
Hey, you don't see this, why?

529
00:35:55,470 --> 00:35:57,270
I'm still surprised!

530
00:35:57,290 --> 00:35:58,800
Hello?

531
00:35:58,310 --> 00:35:59,520
(Matsumoto's older brother: Takahiro)

532
00:35:58,340 --> 00:36:00,140
hey!

533
00:35:59,940 --> 00:36:01,890
This is brother!

534
00:36:00,610 --> 00:36:03,030
Oh, hello! I'm Hamada!

535
00:36:03,030 --> 00:36:04,310
OH! Hi.

536
00:36:04,310 --> 00:36:06,870
Your brother is trying his best now.

537
00:36:05,800 --> 00:36:06,850
OH!

538
00:36:06,850 --> 00:36:08,020
Shall I put him on?

539
00:36:08,020 --> 00:36:10,420
Yes please.

540
00:36:08,630 --> 00:36:09,790
Ok!

541
00:36:12,870 --> 00:36:13,560
hey.

542
00:36:13,560 --> 00:36:14,490
Hey you

543
00:36:14,530 --> 00:36:15,070

544
00:36:15,070 --> 00:36:16,470
Your brother

545
00:36:16,470 --> 00:36:19,020
What/Who are you!!?

546
00:36:19,380 --> 00:36:22,140
You should have nothing to do with me now!

547
00:36:22,710 --> 00:36:26,730
I heard from Hama-chan you're in trouble now.

548
00:36:26,730 --> 00:36:27,820
Oh, where?

549
00:36:27,820 --> 00:36:30,660
Eh? No, I'm at home in Amagasaki

550
00:36:31,080 --> 00:36:32,710
Why are you calling me from such place?

551
00:36:32,720 --> 00:36:35,190
No, but you are coming back for the bon festival, aren't you?

552
00:36:35,190 --> 00:36:36,690
No, I won't come back for the festival...

553
00:36:39,130 --> 00:36:42,440
Mom and dad are waiting for you.

554

.na...but...

555
00:36:44,120 --> 00:36:46,990
That shouldn't concern you...should it?

00:36:46,990 --> 00:36:47,880
HEY!

00:36:47,880 --> 00:36:51,220

What?

561
00:36:53,120 --> 00:36:55,680
I made a song for you, so, can you listen to it?

You...

583
00:38:27,650 --> 00:38:30,410
You're overreacting !

584
00:38:33,100 --> 00:38:37,760
This is just like the pattern. They always scare us and we're like:"DooGH"!

00:38:38,700 --> 00:38:42,260
I'm sorry Matsumoto, I destroyed your Jigsaw puzzle..

587
00:38:43,290 --> 00:38:45,400
without it, I have nothing to do around here!

00:38:46,090 --> 00:38:47,270
Man!

589
00:38:47,610 --> 00:38:49,910
Come on man!

590
00:38:49,950 --> 00:38:51,640
I mushed it...

I'm sorry, please make it again! Sorry!

593
00:38:57,680 --> 00:39:00,610
no way, we shouldn't do such thing..

594
00:39:04,880 --> 00:39:10,140
The guys, forced watching the horror video from Matsumoto.

595
00:39:13,980 --> 00:39:17,440
Breaking the vase in...

596
00:39:27,530 --> 00:39:28,640
So, time to go back!

597
00:39:28,640 --> 00:39:30,770
NOOOHOOW!

598
00:39:29,820 --> 00:39:33,700
The guys are getting scared and going back.

599
00:39:33,850 --> 00:39:36,650
You must watch the video! It's cursed!

600
00:39:37,410 --> 00:39:39,160
Good luck!

601
00:39:41,860 --> 00:39:47,500
Matsumoto is alone and lonely

602
00:39:47,720 --> 00:39:50,140
The 3 members return to the staff room.

603
00:39:55,180 --> 00:39:58,540
Look at his face!!

604
00:40:03,100 --> 00:40:06,670
Tajima wearing armor

605
00:40:06,920 --> 00:40:09,160
What the hell was that !?!

606
00:40:10,480 --> 00:40:15,970
Matsumoto is left by himself again, but the night isn't over yet!

607
00:40:17,120 --> 00:40:21,010
We just watched 7:30pm to 10:00pm

608
00:40:21,250 --> 00:40:22,730
of his Batsu Game so far

609
00:40:22,730 --> 00:40:23,820
As I said before,

610
00:40:23,820 --> 00:40:27,670
It was really quiet, even the phone made me jump!

611
00:40:27,670 --> 00:40:32,530
It was really quiet, even the phone made me jump!

612
00:40:34,750 --> 00:40:36,510
We were dead-on with every tricks, weren't we ?

613
00:40:36,510 --> 00:40:38,470
Well, I don't know about...

614
00:40:37,750 --> 00:40:38,470
You didn't let us down for sure

615
00:40:38,670 --> 00:40:46,220
I was always on guard, but then my brother started singing on the phone and

616
00:40:46,220 --> 00:40:47,810
to be interviewed by some African TV

617
00:40:47,810 --> 00:40:49,650
I thought: "What the hell!?"

618
00:40:50,050 --> 00:40:53,000
What was I supposed to do?

619
00:40:53,000 --> 00:40:57,240
And than he destroyed my jissaw puzzle!

620
00:40:57,240 --> 00:40:59,450
I was almost finished with it, too !

621
00:40:59,450 --> 00:41:01,090
But I lost my motivation after he killed it

622
00:41:01,350 --> 00:41:04,140
Seriously what a night...

623
00:41:04,140 --> 00:41:06,420
You figured out the Fart Cushion quickly

624
00:41:06,420 --> 00:41:06,960
What ?

625
00:41:06,960 --> 00:41:10,390
Like the third time

626
00:41:07,970 --> 00:41:10,390
Of couse, I'm not an idiot

627
00:41:10,620 --> 00:41:12,390
I didn't know what to do with it at the third time

628
00:41:12,390 --> 00:41:13,520
I mean, when I came back to the room,

629
00:41:13,520 --> 00:41:16,190
I see a little hill on the chair

630
00:41:16,710 --> 00:41:18,430
So you knew it then

631
00:41:18,430 --> 00:41:20,890
You guys were just bullying me at that point

632
00:41:20,890 --> 00:41:22,460
I kept thinking,

633
00:41:22,460 --> 00:41:25,470
"Should I go ahead and sit on it or not ?"

634
00:41:25,470 --> 00:41:28,260
You couldn't decide whether or not to be a good sport about it

635
00:41:28,260 --> 00:41:32,230
But Hamada got scared of Matsumoto's fart.

636
00:41:33,240 --> 00:41:39,460
And don't you compare MY reaction to Hamada's when he saw the armor.

637
00:41:42,260 --> 00:41:45,170
You were scared of it too!

638
00:41:45,250 --> 00:41:47,040
Yeah, but I'm still handsome

639
00:41:47,040 --> 00:41:49,270
I just went like this, see ?

640
00:41:52,710 --> 00:41:58,000
When Tajima came out of the locker you were all:"AAAAH!".

641
00:41:59,540 --> 00:42:03,410
No no no, I was just like:"AH".

642
00:42:04,270 --> 00:42:07,580
But Hamada was all like:"AAAAAAAHHH!"

643
00:42:07,930 --> 00:42:11,460
But your reaction is a bit too flamboyant

644
00:42:12,070 --> 00:42:13,950
Agreed

645
00:42:13,970 --> 00:42:17,360
Or when you hugged yourself like this to hide your breast

646
00:42:19,330 --> 00:42:24,250
11pm: It's been 4 hours and Matsumoto is starting to look tired.

647
00:42:33,750 --> 00:42:35,230
Hello? We've prepared some fireworks outside the hotel, please come down and enjoy!

648
00:42:35,230 --> 00:42:41,670
Hello? We've prepared some fireworks outside the hotel, please come down and enjoy!

649
00:42:52,830 --> 00:42:55,870
I don't wanna~

650
00:42:56,850 --> 00:42:58,950
Fireworks time!

651
00:42:59,270 --> 00:43:02,700
This time traps prepared for Matsumoto:

652
00:43:00,230 --> 00:43:06,910
Tajima Armor stands at the door

653
00:43:01,150 --> 00:43:06,910
Bear taxdermy moves

654
00:43:01,710 --> 00:43:06,910
Fallen warrior Heipo's pie attack

655
00:43:02,750 --> 00:43:06,910
Lotion on the door knob

656
00:43:03,430 --> 00:43:06,910
Fart Cushion upon return

657
00:43:10,190 --> 00:43:13,790
Tajima Armor suit in...

658
00:43:18,950 --> 00:43:20,730
Who's there..?

659
00:43:25,610 --> 00:43:27,410
What was that?

660
00:43:32,590 --> 00:43:34,570
He falls for all our tricks

661
00:43:37,390 --> 00:43:40,760
Countdown to Bear Taxdermy

662
00:43:48,520 --> 00:43:51,320
Scary! Scary! Scary!

663
00:43:54,210 --> 00:43:56,630
I'm sorry, sorry, sorry

664
00:44:06,030 --> 00:44:11,030
Matsumoto is enjoying the fireworks all by himself.

665
00:44:11,870 --> 00:44:13,510
It's a curse!

666
00:44:14,350 --> 00:44:15,510
The cursed Samurai!!

667
00:44:15,790 --> 00:44:29,870
Heipo keeps repeating "Tatari ja~(It's a curse!) and "Ochibusha~"(the cursed samurai). Matsumoto repeats "Nani?"(what?).

668
00:44:30,590 --> 00:44:31,970
Get out of here, stupid!

669
00:44:46,790 --> 00:44:50,910
Heipo loses his peripheral vision

670
00:45:01,830 --> 00:45:04,830
Heipo gets scared at the staff who came to bring him back

671
00:45:07,270 --> 00:45:09,510
It's a curse !

672
00:45:09,870 --> 00:45:11,180
What? Go away!

673
00:45:11,180 --> 00:45:12,950
I'm scared!

674
00:45:14,560 --> 00:45:16,220
I don't care

675
00:45:17,110 --> 00:45:21,310
Heipo slips and panics

676
00:45:21,810 --> 00:45:24,220
What?! Just go away already!

677
00:45:26,050 --> 00:45:27,000
I can't see..

678
00:45:27,000 --> 00:45:27,850
I don't care

679
00:45:27,850 --> 00:45:28,590
Come with me.

680
00:45:30,330 --> 00:45:32,490
I'd love to go home, too

681
00:45:32,630 --> 00:45:34,670
I'm scared

682
00:45:37,910 --> 00:45:39,710
I'm scared!

683
00:45:41,750 --> 00:45:43,070
What an idiot

684
00:45:45,350 --> 00:45:47,350
I'll bring you some water..in your room.

685
00:45:48,970 --> 00:45:50,180
Bring me some cigarettes

686
00:45:50,340 --> 00:45:51,510
Right away, sir

687
00:45:52,910 --> 00:45:56,000
Don't bang on the door this time.

688
00:45:56,710 --> 00:46:00,020
Countdown to the Lotion on door knob

689
00:46:04,410 --> 00:46:07,110
Fart Cushion

690
00:46:13,950 --> 00:46:16,950
This is bad for my heart!

691
00:46:26,250 --> 00:46:28,130
Here's your water.

692
00:46:42,980 --> 00:46:48,340
Hello, we've prepared a sexy night show for you,

693
00:46:48,720 --> 00:46:51,320
so please come to the mail hall.

694
00:46:56,950 --> 00:47:01,150
Matsumoto checks the schedule

695
00:47:01,990 --> 00:47:03,910
11PM: Sexy night show time!

696
00:47:04,640 --> 00:47:08,940
An old man wandering around and the old man and the 'armor' hiding in Matsumoto's room.

697
00:47:08,940 --> 00:47:11,920
But the biggest trap is the show itself!

698
00:47:27,830 --> 00:47:30,590
Roaming old-man

699
00:47:33,460 --> 00:47:35,870
[Hamada]:That was scary, right?
[Endo]Yeah, it was.

700
00:47:51,440 --> 00:47:53,580
This sucks.

701
00:48:06,390 --> 00:48:11,030
An over-aged woman as sexy dancer

702
00:48:20,880 --> 00:48:22,640
[Hamada]:That's not even dancing!

703
00:48:44,420 --> 00:48:46,410
[Hamada]:Lame!

704
00:49:17,110 --> 00:49:20,070
10min later

705
00:49:22,480 --> 00:49:24,170
[Matsumoto]:That was REALLY long!

706
00:49:25,810 --> 00:49:28,570
[Hamada]:What's with occasional kiss ?

707
00:49:28,790 --> 00:49:32,910
[Matsumoto]:When the song was over, I thought she would leave me alone. But no...

708
00:49:51,910 --> 00:49:53,840
Shes just kept going...

709
00:50:06,860 --> 00:50:09,190
20min later

710
00:50:47,550 --> 00:50:51,630
While Matsumoto is enjoying the show, Hamada, Endo and Tanaka enter his room again.

711
00:50:55,710 --> 00:50:59,510
Matsumoto has had more than enough.

712
00:51:02,150 --> 00:51:05,270
Roaming old-man

713
00:51:13,190 --> 00:51:17,270
Tashima Armor

714
00:51:59,950 --> 00:52:01,950
Fart Cushion

715
00:52:03,350 --> 00:52:06,790
Matsumoto completely ignores the cushion

716
00:52:23,490 --> 00:52:26,090
You should've seen your face

717
00:52:26,410 --> 00:52:28,790
What was up with your face just now ?

718
00:52:29,490 --> 00:52:32,140
We brought you some snacks

719
00:52:32,130 --> 00:52:33,710
We thought you'd be hungry

720
00:52:33,840 --> 00:52:37,260
since you didn't get to eat much tonight

721
00:52:40,130 --> 00:52:44,270
Your face was like this just now

722
00:52:48,080 --> 00:52:49,570
And that's something to be proud of...

723
00:52:50,590 --> 00:52:53,530
Exactly. What happen d before?

724
00:52:55,110 --> 00:52:57,230
Well...

725
00:52:57,230 --> 00:52:59,470
..there was a monster.

726
00:53:00,570 --> 00:53:02,080
A monster?

727
00:53:02,100 --> 00:53:04,100
It finally got you

728
00:53:04,500 --> 00:53:06,760
You must have been scared, right?

729
00:53:07,060 --> 00:53:08,900
Really scared.

730
00:53:09,900 --> 00:53:11,480
Moooaah, so I went to the sexy show!

731
00:53:11,480 --> 00:53:13,410
Moooaah, so I went to the sexy show!

732
00:53:13,920 --> 00:53:17,610
And that old hag with the perm just kept dancing around!

733
00:53:17,610 --> 00:53:19,710
She just wouldn't stop!!

734
00:53:20,120 --> 00:53:24,360
For more than 20 minutes!

735
00:53:25,380 --> 00:53:33,320
She smelled bad and she kissed me so many times too!

736
00:53:41,630 --> 00:53:43,610
That's just cruel!

737
00:53:43,610 --> 00:53:45,500
Isn't it?

738
00:53:48,690 --> 00:53:52,120
I just wanna go home.

739
00:53:53,030 --> 00:53:56,350
Countdown to the painting falling

740
00:54:04,700 --> 00:54:07,140
Tanaka, your reaction is way too much

741
00:54:14,310 --> 00:54:15,860
By the way,

742
00:54:16,390 --> 00:54:19,110
..Give me a break with that fart cushion.

743
00:54:23,460 --> 00:54:25,710
Every time I get back..

744
00:54:25,710 --> 00:54:29,960
It was funny the first two or three times but..

745
00:54:29,960 --> 00:54:32,270
Every time I come back to the room

746
00:54:32,270 --> 00:54:34,590
I see a nice mound

747
00:54:36,620 --> 00:54:38,520
I'm not an idiot

748
00:54:42,680 --> 00:54:43,930
Stop sighing

749
00:54:50,190 --> 00:54:54,060
You're way too jumpy

750
00:54:54,180 --> 00:54:56,570
Well, I'm the closest to the wall

751
00:54:56,960 --> 00:54:59,850
I almost choked on this

752
00:55:01,180 --> 00:55:03,220
That scared the hell outta me

753
00:55:08,710 --> 00:55:10,520
What do we do now ?

754
00:55:10,930 --> 00:55:12,620
What can we do ?

755
00:55:17,460 --> 00:55:20,480
Since you're here, why don't you sleep over ?

756
00:55:21,370 --> 00:55:23,980
No, I don't think so

757
00:55:23,980 --> 00:55:27,390
Seriously, there's nothing to do

758
00:55:30,470 --> 00:55:32,630
Actually, there's plenty to do

759
00:55:35,020 --> 00:55:37,460
That's bugging me over there

760
00:55:38,990 --> 00:55:40,640
I wanna go pee so bad

761
00:55:40,640 --> 00:55:41,650
Bathroom?

762
00:55:47,310 --> 00:55:49,470
...I'm scared..

763
00:55:49,950 --> 00:55:54,030
Matsumoto is scared like a little child.

764
00:55:52,150 --> 00:55:53,910
Wait until I get back...OK ?

765
00:55:56,350 --> 00:56:00,190
Don't do anything funny when I get back!

766
00:56:02,310 --> 00:56:06,350
Tashima Armor is setup

767
00:56:15,600 --> 00:56:17,500
What's the matter?

768
00:56:17,870 --> 00:56:20,050
What the heck was that?!

769
00:56:22,790 --> 00:56:26,470
Matsumoto laughs at his own helplessness

770
00:56:27,110 --> 00:56:28,650
What?

771
00:56:32,790 --> 00:56:34,590
Endo, go see for yourself.

772
00:56:34,820 --> 00:56:38,270
Matsumoto is 38, right? What's up with that reaction?

773
00:56:43,550 --> 00:56:45,240
That's SCARY!

774
00:56:48,080 --> 00:56:52,370
That's not fair, Hamada, go check it out!

775
00:56:50,640 --> 00:56:52,640
I don't want to..

776
00:56:52,830 --> 00:56:54,830
Just go already!

777
00:57:07,490 --> 00:57:10,100
You know, he's been everywhere tonight

778
00:57:11,240 --> 00:57:13,640
So you've seen him many times tonight ?

779
00:57:13,670 --> 00:57:14,950
Oh! He's gone.

780
00:57:14,280 --> 00:57:15,810
Are you sure?

781
00:57:14,720 --> 00:57:15,810
Yes

782
00:57:17,880 --> 00:57:20,090
What's with him? He gives me the creeps..

783
00:57:27,950 --> 00:57:31,310
Matsumoto fell into Endo's trap.

784
00:57:32,380 --> 00:57:34,100
That's just mean!

785
00:57:37,940 --> 00:57:40,660
You've been letting out some screams tonight

786
00:57:45,540 --> 00:57:47,700
Cut it out already.

787
00:57:47,700 --> 00:57:49,700
He's gone now, it's alright.

788
00:57:59,690 --> 00:58:05,900
The toilet is in front of Matsumoto's room.

789
00:58:07,020 --> 00:58:09,920
But what he didn't know..

790
00:58:10,910 --> 00:58:16,730
The toilet is haunted!

791
00:58:38,910 --> 00:58:39,710
Hold on!!

792
00:58:39,710 --> 00:58:40,390
That is too cruel!!!That is too cruel!!!

793
00:58:40,390 --> 00:58:41,590
That is too cruel!!!That is too cruel!!!

794
00:58:41,590 --> 00:58:43,590
THAT IS TOO CRUEL!!!!~~~

795
00:58:44,870 --> 00:58:48,550
Matsumoto is seriously scared.

796
00:58:59,160 --> 00:59:01,250
Oh, what's wrong with him ?

797
00:59:01,350 --> 00:59:04,430
I just screwed up my bladder

798
00:59:06,200 --> 00:59:08,460
What was that supposed to mean?

799
00:59:08,490 --> 00:59:12,070
I didn't know how I can stop the peeing

800
00:59:14,020 --> 00:59:16,750
So, you were in midst of peeing ?

801
00:59:14,910 --> 00:59:16,750
Yes, I was

802
00:59:18,430 --> 00:59:20,560
I'm not going back in there..

803
00:59:23,910 --> 00:59:25,400
How about you give it another try?

804
00:59:31,310 --> 00:59:34,300
Just let me pee, ok?

805
00:59:42,550 --> 00:59:45,390
People have to pee...

806
00:59:45,390 --> 00:59:46,430
seriously!

807
00:59:46,430 --> 00:59:48,790
People have to pee...so...

808
00:59:48,790 --> 00:59:52,790
Matsumoto is talking to himself out of fear

809
00:59:52,810 --> 00:59:54,580
Come on..ok? This is..

810
00:59:54,580 --> 00:59:56,840
people have to pee...

811
01:00:02,610 --> 01:00:05,720
LEAVE ME ALONE~~~!!

812
01:00:12,960 --> 01:00:15,520
I'm creeped out!

813
01:00:16,360 --> 01:00:18,830
I'll pee in here, ok?

814
01:00:18,860 --> 01:00:22,780
You can't do that! Go back to the bathroom!

815
01:00:25,240 --> 01:00:27,170
What is in there anyways?

816
01:00:28,850 --> 01:00:31,740
There's one scary looking woman in there

817
01:00:32,980 --> 01:00:34,950
Just stop it, ok? I need to go. People need to pee right?

818
01:00:34,950 --> 01:00:37,520
Just stop it, ok? I need to go. People need to pee right?

819
01:00:37,520 --> 01:00:40,310
I don't want to mess up this location either

820
01:00:47,530 --> 01:00:49,760
Wait..come with me.

821
01:00:50,320 --> 01:00:51,570
Well no, I don't need to go

822
01:00:51,570 --> 01:00:53,650
Me neither

823
01:00:54,810 --> 01:00:55,640
Hamada.

824
01:00:56,130 --> 01:01:00,140
Matsumoto pleads Hamada for help.

825
01:01:01,330 --> 01:01:03,760
Who said I have to pee alone ?

826
01:01:09,400 --> 01:01:13,090
What's up with that "creepy girl"?

827
01:01:11,250 --> 01:01:14,990
Hamada lends Matsumoto a hand.

828
01:01:14,780 --> 01:01:16,250
Where?

829
01:01:18,310 --> 01:01:19,470
In here!

830
01:01:19,470 --> 01:01:20,780
What?

831
01:01:20,780 --> 01:01:23,590
Come on, come on, come on.

832
01:01:24,200 --> 01:01:26,130
Look.

833
01:01:26,520 --> 01:01:28,580
What the hell are you doing?

834
01:01:46,580 --> 01:01:47,650
Did you see it?

835
01:01:48,500 --> 01:01:49,730
Don't you get used to it?

836
01:01:49,730 --> 01:01:52,060
Yeah.

837
01:01:50,110 --> 01:01:52,110
It's been 3 times already.

838
01:01:53,880 --> 01:01:54,840
Did you finish?

839
01:01:54,840 --> 01:01:56,690
I didn't..

840
01:01:58,300 --> 01:02:01,940
I'm so hating this...

841
01:02:04,750 --> 01:02:06,610
But you got used to it, right?

842
01:02:07,460 --> 01:02:09,370
She will leave you alone this time...

843
01:02:16,950 --> 01:02:21,820
Matsumoto avoids looking in the window.

844
01:02:23,550 --> 01:02:24,880
Hamada: What's he doing..?

845
01:02:32,290 --> 01:02:34,550
That's enough. ENOUGH!

846
01:02:34,570 --> 01:02:38,010
That's it. I've had enough, really, I've had enough!

847
01:02:38,440 --> 01:02:40,010
I can't pee like that.

848
01:02:40,370 --> 01:02:41,400
Go ahead and just pee

849
01:02:41,400 --> 01:02:42,580
No way

850
01:02:42,600 --> 01:02:44,760
No way I can pee in that environment

851
01:02:44,790 --> 01:02:46,070
It's not good to hold it in though

852
01:02:46,380 --> 01:02:49,060
What are you doing? You can't do that!

853
01:02:49,180 --> 01:02:53,520
Matsumoto decides to pee in a cup.

854
01:02:54,050 --> 01:02:57,160
At this point, I don't care if this footage will be aired

855
01:03:04,500 --> 01:03:07,970
Staff: Tell Matsumoto he can go now.

856
01:03:07,640 --> 01:03:09,220
You can go now.

857
01:03:09,370 --> 01:03:12,240
He already started...

858
01:03:12,260 --> 01:03:14,640
Do we really have to see this...?

859
01:03:16,550 --> 01:03:19,390
He's just standing there.

860
01:03:19,380 --> 01:03:20,650
Crap!! the cup is too small !

861
01:03:28,700 --> 01:03:30,460
Is this guy for real?

862
01:03:31,360 --> 01:03:33,730
You look exhaused, Matsumoto-san

863
01:03:34,650 --> 01:03:36,310
He is peeing very long..

864
01:03:39,020 --> 01:03:40,950
He has too much pee.

865
01:03:42,550 --> 01:03:44,440
You're still peeing...

866
01:03:45,920 --> 01:03:48,600
How do you manage that? Go throw that away in the toilet!

867
01:03:48,600 --> 01:03:51,680
If I do so, I have to go to the bathroom again...

868
01:03:51,690 --> 01:03:53,000
The ghost is gone now.

869
01:03:53,020 --> 01:03:54,150
Yes, it's ok now.

870
01:03:54,150 --> 01:03:56,140
You must throw it in toilet now!

871
01:04:04,790 --> 01:04:05,640
What?

872
01:04:05,650 --> 01:04:07,910
Why did you come back with those cups?!

873
01:04:07,910 --> 01:04:09,340
Hey! Why did you?

874
01:04:09,340 --> 01:04:11,070
There is no place to put these...

875
01:04:11,250 --> 01:04:13,330
You should have put it in a corner in the bathroom.

876
01:04:13,960 --> 01:04:14,640
Yes..

877
01:04:15,210 --> 01:04:16,010
huh?

878
01:04:16,020 --> 01:04:16,620
yes.

879
01:04:16,620 --> 01:04:17,680
Not just "yes"!

880
01:04:17,680 --> 01:04:18,660
But it's ok.

881
01:04:22,350 --> 01:04:24,860
No, it was too scary, no way!

882
01:04:25,660 --> 01:04:27,640
No way....

883
01:04:28,150 --> 01:04:29,590
So time to go back. -Yes.

884
01:04:29,850 --> 01:04:30,620
Good luck.

885
01:04:32,870 --> 01:04:34,120
Eh..why?

886
01:04:35,700 --> 01:04:37,460
Oh...well..

887
01:04:39,820 --> 01:04:43,360
They are surprised by Tanaka kicking the door.

888
01:04:40,900 --> 01:04:43,360
What are you doing man?!

889
01:04:45,000 --> 01:04:47,770
Countdown to Tashima Armor

890
01:04:52,620 --> 01:04:55,080
What does that guy think he is!

891
01:04:55,360 --> 01:04:57,240
So, good luck Matsumoto.

892
01:04:57,260 --> 01:04:58,600
We're leaving.

893
01:05:04,120 --> 01:05:09,620
Matsumoto is left alone again.

894
01:05:16,070 --> 01:05:17,830
Excuse me

895
01:05:18,690 --> 01:05:19,880
Hamada: Did he have to do that ?

896
01:05:19,600 --> 01:05:23,230
Landlady Fujiwara

897
01:05:20,820 --> 01:05:21,970
Don't kick the door.

898
01:05:22,460 --> 01:05:23,540
Sorry.

899
01:05:26,660 --> 01:05:27,400
Matsumoto..

900
01:05:27,400 --> 01:05:28,280
Yeah?

901
01:05:28,710 --> 01:05:35,810
Its the hotel usage, in fact, we ask all the guests...

902
01:05:35,910 --> 01:05:40,620
to join the purification to purge of ghosts.

903
01:05:41,390 --> 01:05:45,640
So we want Mr. Matsumoto to also join the purification,

904
01:05:46,120 --> 01:05:48,830
at the shrine outside...

905
01:05:49,330 --> 01:05:51,160
So please join us.

906
01:05:52,760 --> 01:05:54,580
That can't be true...

907
01:05:55,410 --> 01:05:57,670
So, there are ghosts, huh?

908
01:05:58,290 --> 01:06:00,630
0:30am: Time to visit the shrine.

909
01:06:01,480 --> 01:06:09,280
This time mysterious phenomena:

910
01:06:02,040 --> 01:06:09,280
- Konya Ga Yamada waiting for Matsumoto.

911
01:06:04,440 --> 01:06:09,280
- Tajima wearing armor and attacking.

912
01:06:11,280 --> 01:06:15,220
Night camera

913
01:06:15,690 --> 01:06:17,520
This way.

914
01:06:25,110 --> 01:06:26,640
What is that ?

915
01:06:31,480 --> 01:06:33,090
There is something there, huh?

916
01:06:37,180 --> 01:06:38,640
There's something.

917
01:06:40,090 --> 01:06:41,700
No, no, ma.

918
01:06:41,380 --> 01:06:46,480
Konya Ga Yamada waiting

919
01:06:42,200 --> 01:06:43,430
Who?

920
01:06:48,750 --> 01:06:51,720
Ohhhh...he is Konya Ga Yamada...

921
01:06:52,190 --> 01:06:54,160
He has nothing to do with this

922
01:06:55,460 --> 01:06:57,740
Please, this way.

923
01:07:00,530 --> 01:07:01,860
Eh? A hill, this way?

924
01:07:02,130 --> 01:07:02,610
yes

925
01:07:02,760 --> 01:07:05,400
From here on, Matsumoto, you have to go alone.

926
01:07:06,590 --> 01:07:12,880
Was that your joke?!

927
01:07:07,080 --> 01:07:08,490
No, no ,no!

928
01:07:08,490 --> 01:07:10,070
It's a joke, I'm with you..

929
01:07:12,880 --> 01:07:14,080
-yes.

930
01:07:15,490 --> 01:07:17,470
What is this? Woah~

931
01:07:19,480 --> 01:07:20,660
Its a torii...!

932
01:07:29,150 --> 01:07:32,230
Woah, we shouldn't go through here...huh?

933
01:07:33,930 --> 01:07:36,400
Ohh...it's grim...

934
01:07:39,670 --> 01:07:41,400
Over there Matsumoto.

935
01:07:41,670 --> 01:07:42,550
Eh?

936
01:07:45,360 --> 01:07:46,440
Paying homage at a shrine?

937
01:07:58,000 --> 01:07:59,980
We shouldn't be here...

938
01:08:01,960 --> 01:08:03,060
No...whatever, we shouldn't...

939
01:08:03,060 --> 01:08:04,090
Here, hold this.

940
01:08:07,130 --> 01:08:10,640
Countdown to Tashima Armor

941
01:08:16,660 --> 01:08:19,660
Hey, it's dangerous to do such thing in this place!!!

942
01:08:23,500 --> 01:08:26,940
Don't do it!! We can slip away dude!

943
01:08:31,360 --> 01:08:35,360
Fujiwara can't help it to laugh at scared Matsumoto.

944
01:08:35,950 --> 01:08:36,990
Is he gone?

945
01:08:38,320 --> 01:08:39,820
-Ok?

946
01:08:38,940 --> 01:08:40,330
-Yes.

947
01:08:41,670 --> 01:08:44,380
Why do you gotta come out while I'm praying ??

948
01:08:44,580 --> 01:08:47,030
Why now show yourself before I started my prayer ?

949
01:08:47,750 --> 01:08:50,260
That was so backwards !

950
01:08:51,260 --> 01:08:53,870
You took me too such a high place...don't be silly.

951
01:08:55,410 --> 01:08:57,060
It's really scary here, man.

952
01:08:58,520 --> 01:08:59,920
Yamada is still there...

953
01:09:08,260 --> 01:09:10,530
Konya Ga Yamada

954
01:09:13,530 --> 01:09:16,270
Musn't he have said that when we went to the shrine?

955
01:09:16,270 --> 01:09:19,440
He must have missed the timing to say it.

956
01:09:19,450 --> 01:09:21,790
He must have waited there to say that.

957
01:09:22,120 --> 01:09:25,960
Matsumoto's night isn't over yet...

958
01:09:29,330 --> 01:09:30,630
Grandma night show..

959
01:09:30,630 --> 01:09:31,880
Ya, ya, ya

960
01:09:31,880 --> 01:09:34,020
I was like, "give me a break"

961
01:09:34,020 --> 01:09:37,980
uhm...that must have taken over 20 minutes, I think.

962
01:09:38,080 --> 01:09:40,860
Her arms and legs were short, and..

963
01:09:40,860 --> 01:09:41,800
It's ok

964
01:09:41,800 --> 01:09:44,810
And that room was dark, so you may couldn't see, but

965
01:09:44,810 --> 01:09:47,620
really, my shirt was full of lipstick marks

966
01:09:47,950 --> 01:09:51,060
She gave me over 40 kisses

967
01:09:52,440 --> 01:09:55,470
She couldn't take away my soul though

968
01:09:56,280 --> 01:09:58,440
We appeared from the doors with loud bangs.

969
01:09:59,420 --> 01:10:03,260
Here's the reason why we visited you then: We wanted you to go to the bathroom

970
01:10:04,140 --> 01:10:05,600
so we brought you a bottle of water

971
01:10:05,600 --> 01:10:08,970
and have you drink tons of it to get you into the bathroom

972
01:10:09,290 --> 01:10:10,060
ya, you did?

973
01:10:10,060 --> 01:10:12,900
And I found out why the awful sexy show went on for so long

974
01:10:12,900 --> 01:10:15,330
was because you needed more time to set up for another pranks ?

975
01:10:13,810 --> 01:10:15,690
Yes, we were running late

976
01:10:15,770 --> 01:10:18,020
So I had to take a hit for that

977
01:10:18,020 --> 01:10:22,840
Why should I have to be kissed by some old bitch because of your inadequate preparation ?

978
01:10:22,840 --> 01:10:24,840
It's like the Murphy's Law

979
01:10:24,850 --> 01:10:26,170
Yes, like that

980
01:10:28,470 --> 01:10:30,260
But who could forget your bathroom incident ?

981
01:10:30,260 --> 01:10:32,320
You were like this ?

982
01:10:32,320 --> 01:10:35,760
It was so scary even if I knew she'd show

983
01:10:36,250 --> 01:10:38,730
I tried to avoid the window by kneeling like this

984
01:10:38,930 --> 01:10:39,630
And...

985
01:10:39,950 --> 01:10:42,900
my junk was touching the urinal

986
01:10:44,430 --> 01:10:47,140
Imagine flickering the cigarette ash like this

987
01:10:48,790 --> 01:10:50,600
You're saying your junk is like cigarette ?

988
01:10:50,600 --> 01:10:53,050
Yeah, I'm sure I made contact with bacterias then

989
01:10:53,910 --> 01:10:55,270
I didn't care though

990
01:10:55,740 --> 01:10:57,520
You were just plain terrified

991
01:10:59,440 --> 01:11:00,620
When you see this footage,

992
01:11:00,650 --> 01:11:02,710
it doesn't look all that dark outside

993
01:11:03,350 --> 01:11:05,760
especially with the lantern lit

994
01:11:07,430 --> 01:11:09,380
But I gotta tell you how much I couldn't see around

995
01:11:09,380 --> 01:11:10,890
Maybe this much around was visible

996
01:11:10,890 --> 01:11:13,910
and I couldn't see anything beyond a meter or so

997
01:11:15,390 --> 01:11:17,260
And how useless is Heipo san ?

998
01:11:16,500 --> 01:11:18,050
Now you mention it..!

999
01:11:18,510 --> 01:11:20,740
He really pissed me off

1000
01:11:20,740 --> 01:11:23,630
Every time I asked him something he kept repeating himself:

1001
01:11:23,630 --> 01:11:26,050
Aaah, Kowai!

1002
01:11:26,050 --> 01:11:28,120
So one of the assistants came to get him and

1003
01:11:28,120 --> 01:11:30,430
he was like, "Kowaii !!!"

1004
01:11:30,810 --> 01:11:32,800
He got scared at an assistant director, too

1005
01:11:37,380 --> 01:11:39,210
He was real pain in the butt.

1006
01:11:39,440 --> 01:11:41,470
When Heipo ran into the staff,

1007
01:11:41,550 --> 01:11:43,420
Even when the staff signals "OK, Heipo, well done !"

1008
01:11:43,420 --> 01:11:45,510
Heipo thought they were trying to scare him like this

1009
01:11:46,000 --> 01:11:48,100
He got mixed up between these two gestures

1010
01:11:50,480 --> 01:11:51,800
He mixed up these two?

1011
01:11:51,800 --> 01:11:54,080
Yes, like this.

1012
01:11:56,740 --> 01:11:58,200
He annoyed you guys too, right ?

1013
01:11:58,710 --> 01:11:59,690
He needs to "get it together"

1014
01:12:00,210 --> 01:12:03,180
Midnight, 1:00 a.m.

1015
01:12:03,680 --> 01:12:07,290
Matsumoto receives another invitation

1016
01:12:17,920 --> 01:12:19,280
Hello!

1017
01:12:17,920 --> 01:12:19,280
Yes?

1018
01:12:19,280 --> 01:12:23,560
We have prepared a Beer meeting with one of our guests.

1019
01:12:23,560 --> 01:12:26,760
Could u please come to the 3th floor?
And follow the signs.

1020
01:12:27,610 --> 01:12:28,330
Yes.

1021
01:12:38,560 --> 01:12:41,370
I don't want too~~

1022
01:12:41,920 --> 01:12:44,370
1:30 Beer and putkong (kongjongryu) time

1023
01:12:45,130 --> 01:12:53,280
To get to the beer, Matsumoto has to climb the stairs and walk his way op to the 3th flloor.

1024
01:13:40,160 --> 01:13:41,070
Good evening.

1025
01:13:41,450 --> 01:13:42,040
Hello.

1026
01:13:42,560 --> 01:13:43,820
Yamasaki: He was really scared.

1027
01:13:50,870 --> 01:13:53,020
I was asked to keep you company tonight

1028
01:13:53,140 --> 01:13:54,000
Ah ok.

1029
01:13:54,090 --> 01:13:55,060
Let's have some drinks

1030
01:13:55,310 --> 01:13:55,920
EH.

1031
01:13:56,380 --> 01:14:00,200
Tsumami Edamame is known for his keen connection with the after-life

1032
01:14:00,200 --> 01:14:06,140
and also known to have witnessed countless paranormal activities

1033
01:14:08,260 --> 01:14:10,700
I wouldn't advise you to continue this game

1034
01:14:10,790 --> 01:14:13,190
Well, I would love to quit right now but...

1035
01:14:13,880 --> 01:14:14,870
Is it the batsu game?

1036
01:14:21,540 --> 01:14:23,240
I don't like this location

1037
01:14:24,450 --> 01:14:25,350
Well...

1038
01:14:26,270 --> 01:14:28,730
As a celebrity, I travel a lot for my work

1039
01:14:28,990 --> 01:14:30,100
and spend a night or two

1040
01:14:30,660 --> 01:14:32,010
at different hotels

1041
01:14:32,100 --> 01:14:32,940
hmm

1042
01:14:33,210 --> 01:14:37,540
I stayed at this particular hotel about two hot summers ago,

1043
01:14:34,590 --> 01:14:40,490
*Matsumoto is beginning to get frightened*

1044
01:14:38,100 --> 01:14:40,500
Including 2 in this room.

1045
01:14:41,790 --> 01:14:43,780
And as I turned off the light to go to sleep,

1046
01:14:45,370 --> 01:14:46,480
I was on third floor by the way,

1047
01:14:46,910 --> 01:14:47,950
I heard these running footsteps

1048
01:14:48,760 --> 01:14:49,570
from one floor down

1049
01:14:50,560 --> 01:14:52,680
It sounded like it ran down the hallway

1050
01:14:55,430 --> 01:14:57,570
It was definitely a running sound...

1051
01:14:55,970 --> 01:14:59,540
Matsumoto gets even more afraid.

1052
01:14:58,090 --> 01:15:00,710
And I wonder why it was running in the middle of the night

1053
01:15:01,260 --> 01:15:02,680
Then, at that point,

1054
01:15:03,160 --> 01:15:03,870
The same running sound

1055
01:15:04,260 --> 01:15:06,870
came from the floor above me

1056
01:15:08,580 --> 01:15:09,660
Just like that

1057
01:15:10,460 --> 01:15:14,990
Matsumoto refuses to make an eye contact out of fear

1058
01:15:12,100 --> 01:15:15,690
I was freaked out and when I looked up

1059
01:15:16,790 --> 01:15:21,700
I saw an old man hovering by the window with an child on his back

1060
01:15:21,700 --> 01:15:24,840
I got scared and quickly went to go close that window

1061
01:15:24,960 --> 01:15:27,250
And I told myself to move to the next room

1062
01:15:27,250 --> 01:15:30,890
and as I was trying to leave that room,

1063
01:15:31,190 --> 01:15:35,930
I saw the same old man squeezing himself out between two Tatami floor mats

1064
01:15:46,460 --> 01:15:47,680
That's enough !!

1065
01:15:48,330 --> 01:15:51,100
Go home !

1066
01:15:51,590 --> 01:15:53,800
Go home !

1067
01:16:02,810 --> 01:16:06,310
Why are you guys still here ?

1068
01:16:06,310 --> 01:16:08,180
We didn't mean to bother you..

1069
01:16:08,580 --> 01:16:10,450
And what's with your stomache growling, idiot

1070
01:16:10,450 --> 01:16:11,980
I thought Matsumoto would hear that

1071
01:16:11,540 --> 01:16:12,830
I heard it

1072
01:16:12,180 --> 01:16:13,080
So, you heard it

1073
01:16:13,620 --> 01:16:16,900
I heard it, so I decided to talk a little louder

1074
01:16:17,410 --> 01:16:20,090
It was a loud growl

1075
01:16:21,700 --> 01:16:23,760
All kidding aside,

1076
01:16:23,760 --> 01:16:25,820
This type of hotel is known to be haunted

1077
01:16:25,820 --> 01:16:27,360
Of course, some are myths

1078
01:16:27,360 --> 01:16:29,760
but some are not

1079
01:16:30,050 --> 01:16:34,510
So I wouldn't horse around here thinking this is all a big joke

1080
01:16:34,510 --> 01:16:35,390
Just watch yourselves

1081
01:16:42,600 --> 01:16:44,410
Hamada: Look at all of us jump

1082
01:16:46,480 --> 01:16:47,800
Yes, Endo here?

1083
01:16:51,620 --> 01:16:54,760
Apparantly, the Beer and Snack time is over

1084
01:16:55,470 --> 01:16:57,300
And we should head back

1085
01:16:58,420 --> 01:17:00,190
to our room

1086
01:17:03,770 --> 01:17:05,500
Huh ?

1087
01:17:05,500 --> 01:17:07,440
I'm going back alone ??

1088
01:17:24,120 --> 01:17:25,920
Why two separate phone calls ?

1089
01:17:28,760 --> 01:17:31,490
Walking down that hallway gives me the creeps

1090
01:17:31,580 --> 01:17:33,880
OH! I forgot to tell you one last thing

1091
01:17:33,880 --> 01:17:34,930
uhm..

1092
01:17:35,050 --> 01:17:36,970
You won't need to look if you're too creeped out but

1093
01:17:36,970 --> 01:17:39,600
sometimes you'd feel this weight on your shoulder

1094
01:17:39,870 --> 01:17:40,930
This really does happen

1095
01:17:41,470 --> 01:17:42,620
It just happens out of nowhere

1096
01:17:42,620 --> 01:17:44,300
my wife experienced this as well

1097
01:17:44,300 --> 01:17:46,040
And you get freaked out and turn your head like this

1098
01:17:46,040 --> 01:17:48,880
only to find this hand on your shoulder

1099
01:17:49,680 --> 01:17:52,140
I'm definitely not gonna look

1100
01:17:54,090 --> 01:17:55,780
Thank you for your time!

1101
01:17:56,800 --> 01:17:57,820
Be careful out there

1102
01:17:59,890 --> 01:18:04,300
Japanese armor suit

1103
01:17:59,900 --> 01:18:02,440
The above floor looks even scarier

1104
01:18:02,450 --> 01:18:04,180
Right, we need to avoid going up there

1105
01:18:07,830 --> 01:18:09,380
Why did they put that here...

1106
01:18:13,370 --> 01:18:14,040
BANG!!

1107
01:18:19,740 --> 01:18:23,750
The team runs away like little girls.

1108
01:18:22,310 --> 01:18:23,760
What's your problem ?

1109
01:18:27,780 --> 01:18:28,620
No, listen, listen

1110
01:18:28,620 --> 01:18:30,420
My head hurts from screaming so much

1111
01:18:32,130 --> 01:18:34,140
I don't think this moves

1112
01:19:12,530 --> 01:19:16,530
Matsumoto just ignores the Fart Cushion.

1113
01:19:18,680 --> 01:19:20,410
2:00AM

1114
01:19:20,840 --> 01:19:24,220
Matsumoto is left alone in his room.

1115
01:20:01,910 --> 01:20:06,080
Don't do that to me

1116
01:20:17,610 --> 01:20:18,370
Yes?

1117
01:20:20,200 --> 01:20:22,270
The ghost in the toilet is gone now, you are rest assured...

1118
01:20:23,990 --> 01:20:25,140
You need to stop with that

1119
01:20:26,740 --> 01:20:28,070
Do you want me to get sick, idiot ?!

1120
01:20:28,080 --> 01:20:30,010
Please enjoy yourself.

1121
01:20:32,840 --> 01:20:35,450
"The ghost in the toilet is gone now" ???

1122
01:20:38,310 --> 01:20:40,180
So you were behind all this

1123
01:20:54,470 --> 01:20:58,000
Matsumoto is still super-sensitive to the phone rings

1124
01:20:58,720 --> 01:20:59,340
Yes?

1125
01:20:59,760 --> 01:21:00,900
Eh..Matsumoto-sama,

1126
01:21:00,910 --> 01:21:03,540
We have prepared a late night bath for you,

1127
01:21:03,720 --> 01:21:08,000
So please come to the bathing area to enjoy yourself.

1128
01:21:08,120 --> 01:21:09,070
There's more ??

1129
01:21:11,380 --> 01:21:12,650
What the..?

1130
01:21:19,020 --> 01:21:20,920
Onsen (Bathing) time

1131
01:21:23,130 --> 01:21:29,530
*Woman in white at the entrance

1132
01:21:25,230 --> 01:21:29,530
*Konya Ga Yamada in changing room

1133
01:21:27,130 --> 01:21:29,530
*Fujiwara hidden in the bath

1134
01:21:40,010 --> 01:21:42,710
Just about the time for the woman in white

1135
01:21:43,360 --> 01:21:44,750
Wow, that scared me!

1136
01:21:54,730 --> 01:21:57,170
MOH, why do I have to come here~

1137
01:22:09,370 --> 01:22:12,880
Countdown to Konya Ga Yamada

1138
01:22:21,260 --> 01:22:23,350
Konya Ga Yamada

1139
01:22:24,740 --> 01:22:26,180
Why go back in there ?

1140
01:22:41,470 --> 01:22:45,480
Matsumoto gets scared over a group of insects

1141
01:22:44,090 --> 01:22:46,560
It was just really scary

1142
01:22:45,100 --> 01:22:46,560
-Naaaa~

1143
01:22:47,710 --> 01:22:50,550
Fujiwara hiding in the bath.

1144
01:22:56,430 --> 01:22:59,760
Excuse me, but I'm here to scrub you down

1145
01:23:00,100 --> 01:23:01,390
No thanks

1146
01:23:01,230 --> 01:23:05,230
Matsumoto gets scrubbed by Fujiwara.

1147
01:23:05,990 --> 01:23:07,450
So how am I doing so far ?

1148
01:23:08,960 --> 01:23:10,090
Hello ?

1149
01:23:10,090 --> 01:23:12,200
Yeah, what do you want ?

1150
01:23:13,020 --> 01:23:19,180
Well, the Lumine Theater has been open for three months now

1151
01:23:19,180 --> 01:23:23,260
And it's been going well but...

1152
01:23:25,250 --> 01:23:29,650
I thought maybe you can show up one of these days

1153
01:23:30,130 --> 01:23:32,520
Why don't you ask Hamada ?

1154
01:23:32,590 --> 01:23:36,540
Of course, I have already asked Hamada-san before

1155
01:23:37,600 --> 01:23:40,800
If Hamada's not doing it, then I'm not doing it either

1156
01:23:40,990 --> 01:23:43,030
So you're saying that

1157
01:23:43,030 --> 01:23:44,600
if Hamada-san agree to show up at the theater,

1158
01:23:44,600 --> 01:23:48,930
you will at least consider it ?

1159
01:23:49,010 --> 01:23:50,010
Yeah

1160
01:23:49,770 --> 01:23:51,550
Oh, thank you very much

1161
01:23:54,950 --> 01:23:56,950
OK, that's enough

1162
01:23:56,950 --> 01:23:58,880
Why can't you evenly scrub my back

1163
01:23:58,880 --> 01:24:00,880
and not concentrate on one area of my back ?

1164
01:24:03,580 --> 01:24:05,690
Enjoy the rest of the night

1165
01:24:10,110 --> 01:24:12,880
Don't kick the door anymore, OK ?

1166
01:24:20,660 --> 01:24:22,590
I don't see why he has to kick the door

1167
01:24:52,540 --> 01:24:57,680
A scary singing girl...

1168
01:25:34,040 --> 01:25:36,300
Your head is up while the sound is going off!

1169
01:25:40,060 --> 01:25:42,270
I was trying to figure out what was going on

1170
01:25:43,320 --> 01:25:45,560
But nothing happened !!

1171
01:25:54,930 --> 01:25:55,650
Yes?

1172
01:25:55,830 --> 01:25:56,890
Hello hello!

1173
01:25:57,930 --> 01:26:04,980
It is almost time to sleep so
we have prepared your futon(bed) in another room.

1174
01:26:06,000 --> 01:26:12,040
The room is on...the...3th...floor,
please follow the arrows to the room.

1175
01:26:12,530 --> 01:26:13,050
Eh?

1176
01:26:13,550 --> 01:26:14,960
Why can't you just bring me the futon ??

1177
01:26:14,970 --> 01:26:17,410
Sorry for the inconvenience

1178
01:26:17,410 --> 01:26:19,070
On the 3th floor?

1179
01:26:19,200 --> 01:26:21,460
In the room with the arrows.

1180
01:26:21,660 --> 01:26:22,360
Yes.

1181
01:26:27,500 --> 01:26:29,700
What kind of service is this ?

1182
01:26:30,200 --> 01:26:31,890
Futton Finding Time!

1183
01:26:33,060 --> 01:26:36,530
The room with Matsumoto's bed is located on the 3th floor.

1184
01:26:36,730 --> 01:26:41,300
Matsumoto has to climb the stairs and walk the hall towards the room.

1185
01:26:43,720 --> 01:26:53,460
This time paranormal phenomenon:

1186
01:26:45,650 --> 01:26:53,460
- A scary old man

1187
01:26:46,710 --> 01:26:53,460
- A scary long haired girl

1188
01:26:49,250 --> 01:26:53,460
- And 2 old grandma's

1189
01:27:45,430 --> 01:27:48,880
Why don't I just sleep in this room ?

1190
01:27:50,650 --> 01:27:54,850
Scary little girl hiding

1191
01:28:29,750 --> 01:28:32,490
Lotion on door knob

1192
01:28:48,010 --> 01:28:51,580
Kind Tashima Armor hands a wet-nap to Matsumoto
to clean his lotioned hand

1193
01:28:55,200 --> 01:28:56,120
3:15AM

1194
01:28:56,840 --> 01:28:59,750
A complete darkness engulfs the haunted hotel

1195
01:29:00,290 --> 01:29:03,770
Yamasaki shows up at the HQ

1196
01:29:03,820 --> 01:29:06,630
Staff needs to trick Matsumoto into stepping outside

1197
01:29:06,630 --> 01:29:09,000
so that Yamasaki can hide in his room

1198
01:29:23,190 --> 01:29:30,150
I have your favorite cup-noodles ready for you in the cupboard

1199
01:29:30,150 --> 01:29:33,280
I hope you'll enjoy it

1200
01:29:34,780 --> 01:29:36,320
Thank you

1201
01:29:53,750 --> 01:29:59,890
Note:
We're out of hot water
Come get it at the neighboring house

1202
01:30:01,270 --> 01:30:03,120
How do you run out of hot water ?

1203
01:30:04,350 --> 01:30:06,580
Just boil the damn water

1204
01:30:07,480 --> 01:30:09,840
3:30AM
Late night meal

1205
01:30:09,840 --> 01:30:18,340
Matsumoto needs to walk about 2km to reach the nearest
neighbor to obtain a hot water for the cup noodle

1206
01:30:18,330 --> 01:30:20,000
Man, it's still dark out here

1207
01:30:20,000 --> 01:30:21,600
Yes, it is

1208
01:30:23,840 --> 01:30:25,050
This will be a long walk

1209
01:30:28,860 --> 01:30:30,620
A complete darkness

1210
01:30:33,540 --> 01:30:34,710
What was that ?

1211
01:30:37,320 --> 01:30:41,920
Matsumoto get´s scared by a rock

1212
01:30:40,340 --> 01:30:42,480
I thought it was a person

1213
01:30:51,620 --> 01:30:53,080
Where to ?

1214
01:30:51,900 --> 01:30:55,600
Here comes Konya Ga Yamada

1215
01:30:58,940 --> 01:31:00,540
Konya Ga Yamada

1216
01:31:03,600 --> 01:31:04,920
You scared me, Fujiwara

1217
01:31:05,710 --> 01:31:08,150
Your scream is scary

1218
01:31:08,610 --> 01:31:12,020
Arrives at neighbor's residence

1219
01:31:20,660 --> 01:31:21,610
Excuse us

1220
01:31:22,140 --> 01:31:23,040
yes?

1221
01:31:24,080 --> 01:31:24,680
uhm..

1222
01:31:26,060 --> 01:31:27,590
I'd like you to give me some hot water.

1223
01:31:27,590 --> 01:31:28,540
Hot water?

1224
01:31:28,540 --> 01:31:29,220
yes.

1225
01:31:29,210 --> 01:31:30,330
Could you wait a minute?

1226
01:31:29,220 --> 01:31:29,270
I'd like you to give me some hot water.

1227
01:31:31,800 --> 01:31:37,580
Yamasaki stands by when Matsumoto goes out.

1228
01:31:31,860 --> 01:31:33,720
I can better hide myself in this closet.

1229
01:31:47,120 --> 01:31:50,320
Oh...There must be something here...

1230
01:31:52,340 --> 01:31:53,600
Hey, Who are you?

1231
01:32:03,940 --> 01:32:04,490
huh

1232
01:32:11,890 --> 01:32:13,280
WOAH!

1233
01:32:16,210 --> 01:32:19,050
Roaming old man

1234
01:32:27,920 --> 01:32:31,430
Yamasaki in...

1235
01:32:56,960 --> 01:32:59,420
I have had enough

1236
01:32:59,870 --> 01:33:03,060
My nerve, around here, will cause me pain tomorrow.

1237
01:33:03,090 --> 01:33:05,830
Because I made this weird motion.

1238
01:33:06,630 --> 01:33:12,640
Matsumoto is feeling relief that Yamasaki is visiting him.

1239
01:33:08,510 --> 01:33:11,770
This is...Scary, yes.

1240
01:33:11,780 --> 01:33:15,830
A little while ago, I went to a small residence that was hidden in such a dark place...

1241
01:33:15,760 --> 01:33:17,210
WAAAH

1242
01:33:24,880 --> 01:33:28,820
Matsumoto cant help laughing at his miserableness.

1243
01:33:28,520 --> 01:33:30,350
But you know, this will be over in a little while.

1244
01:33:30,680 --> 01:33:32,350
This feels forever to me

1245
01:33:32,580 --> 01:33:33,610
But...

1246
01:33:33,610 --> 01:33:35,610
But why doesn't it get light faster?

1247
01:33:35,650 --> 01:33:37,610
Yes, it's still dark around here.

1248
01:33:40,520 --> 01:33:42,450
Well, regrettably, there is something in here Matsumoto.

1249
01:33:43,500 --> 01:33:44,410
Absolutely.

1250
01:33:59,820 --> 01:34:01,810
How many times do you think the wall was hit?

1251
01:34:03,990 --> 01:34:05,550
There's no way you can get used to that.

1252
01:34:07,480 --> 01:34:09,440
yes, there's no way.

1253
01:34:09,440 --> 01:34:12,020
I will never get used to that

1254
01:34:12,550 --> 01:34:14,090
You can't help bouncing.

1255
01:34:15,020 --> 01:34:17,200
So, good luck Matsumoto.

1256
01:34:17,550 --> 01:34:18,550
Good job!

1257
01:34:27,730 --> 01:34:28,660
Hello?

1258
01:34:28,870 --> 01:34:29,580
hello

1259
01:34:29,580 --> 01:34:30,000
yes?

1260
01:34:30,000 --> 01:34:33,360
Oh, excuse me. Can I speak with Matsumoto please?

1261
01:34:37,150 --> 01:34:38,010
hello

1262
01:34:38,050 --> 01:34:39,160
hello

1263
01:34:39,370 --> 01:34:41,170
I'll put him on.

1264
01:34:43,590 --> 01:34:47,530
Reverse dokkiri=Is some kind of reverse joke.

1265
01:34:43,590 --> 01:34:47,530
The staff tells Matsumoto to set the revercedokiri.

1266
01:34:50,460 --> 01:34:51,310
What's up?

1267
01:34:53,240 --> 01:34:54,420
uh, Yamasaki?

1268
01:34:54,680 --> 01:34:55,680
yes?

1269
01:34:57,200 --> 01:34:58,360
uh

1270
01:34:59,600 --> 01:35:00,670
Go to the toilet.

1271
01:35:01,550 --> 01:35:02,430
Toilet?

1272
01:35:04,950 --> 01:35:08,980
Why? Why do I have to go to the toilet?

1273
01:35:09,390 --> 01:35:10,980
So suddenly..It's strange!

1274
01:35:11,390 --> 01:35:14,260
After you talked to the telephone, you tell me this! It's strange!!

1275
01:35:14,280 --> 01:35:15,590
Go pee, huh!

1276
01:35:15,590 --> 01:35:16,490
pee...

1277
01:35:16,490 --> 01:35:19,230
Whatever, just go pee. Because I also went to the bathroom...

1278
01:35:20,380 --> 01:35:22,500
Its natural, because you're here all the time.

1279
01:35:22,500 --> 01:35:24,300
But I don't have to pee!

1280
01:35:25,050 --> 01:35:26,100
I said you must go pee, really.

1281
01:35:26,100 --> 01:35:26,880
Why?

1282
01:35:27,130 --> 01:35:28,340
You wanna go pee, don't you?

1283
01:35:28,340 --> 01:35:29,140
No, not so much.

1284
01:35:29,170 --> 01:35:30,920
Just go pee already..

1285
01:35:31,300 --> 01:35:31,850
Seriously

1286
01:35:34,720 --> 01:35:36,610
Ok, be I'll get going after I pee

1287
01:35:38,130 --> 01:35:38,660
Good luck..

1288
01:35:38,660 --> 01:35:39,640
-You've got to pee!

1289
01:35:39,910 --> 01:35:41,070
-Ok.

1290
01:35:39,910 --> 01:35:41,070
Yes, I'll go.

1291
01:35:41,420 --> 01:35:42,820
-Ok

1292
01:35:41,420 --> 01:35:42,820
Now go pee, properly.

1293
01:35:46,140 --> 01:35:47,950
Don't shout so loudly!

1294
01:35:50,140 --> 01:35:51,360
Go pee.

1295
01:35:53,120 --> 01:35:54,250
Who's there?

1296
01:35:58,400 --> 01:35:59,510
Who's there...?

1297
01:36:16,920 --> 01:36:20,360
Matsumoto cant stop laughing because of his successful joke.

1298
01:36:28,370 --> 01:36:33,300
Yamasaki gets lost and begins to run wildly.

1299
01:36:35,420 --> 01:36:36,900
Heey! I completed.

1300
01:36:38,740 --> 01:36:40,650
Finished.

1301
01:36:40,650 --> 01:36:42,050
Hey, come!!

1302
01:36:49,950 --> 01:36:53,940
Hello, it's almost time to go to bed.

1303
01:36:54,400 --> 01:36:56,560
So please turn off the light.

1304
01:36:57,210 --> 01:36:58,460
Have a good night.

1305
01:37:05,520 --> 01:37:07,020
Really..?

1306
01:37:08,580 --> 01:37:12,650
4:00AM

1307
01:37:18,280 --> 01:37:22,350
This is...I don't wanna be here...

1308
01:37:24,420 --> 01:37:26,980
I don't want the dark...

1309
01:37:36,070 --> 01:37:38,130
It really smells like that old guy.

1310
01:37:51,990 --> 01:37:53,170
I told you not to kick the door!

1311
01:38:03,210 --> 01:38:05,840
The sun starts to rise after 2 hours of sleep.

1312
01:38:05,840 --> 01:38:08,430
The time to get up is coming.

1313
01:38:12,650 --> 01:38:14,350
Good morning.

1314
01:38:16,560 --> 01:38:19,020
Sorry, It's morning now.

1315
01:38:20,350 --> 01:38:25,280
We have prepared breakfast for you so please come to the main hall.

1316
01:38:26,020 --> 01:38:27,930
AM 6:00: Breakfast time.

1317
01:38:30,190 --> 01:38:32,060
Bu       bu      Cushion (1 guess what that means )

1318
01:38:33,090 --> 01:38:36,930
Matsumoto got used to dealing with fart cushions.

1319
01:38:52,390 --> 01:38:53,670
I'm coming in.

1320
01:38:54,190 --> 01:38:59,240
The Central Africa TV would like to get another interview, so please

1321
01:39:03,340 --> 01:39:06,290
Please comment on Hamada, Endo and Tanaka.

1322
01:39:06,360 --> 01:39:18,270
Do an impression
of Antonio Inoki

1323
01:39:13,570 --> 01:39:18,310
uuhh.. you guys are shit, don't be silly...

1324
01:39:19,200 --> 01:39:20,480
Thank you.

1325
01:39:21,310 --> 01:39:27,460
Finally, please say comments to the Central Africa's TV crews.

1326
01:39:27,460 --> 01:39:32,220
Finish it with:
Your fooling plan.

1327
01:39:32,600 --> 01:39:33,530
eh

1328
01:39:33,810 --> 01:39:35,390
Because you are from Africa...

1329
01:39:37,870 --> 01:39:40,130
eh..you look easygoing.

1330
01:39:41,040 --> 01:39:42,620
thank you.

1331
01:39:43,460 --> 01:39:47,000
Sudden water comes out of the mic.!!

1332
01:39:47,240 --> 01:39:48,970
Thank you very much.

1333
01:39:48,970 --> 01:39:51,330
What!? MOOOH!

1334
01:39:52,710 --> 01:39:54,040
Thank you. So much.

1335
01:39:55,300 --> 01:40:01,250
At last, Matsumoto reaches the end of his hard schedule.

1336
01:40:07,420 --> 01:40:09,810
Moh, I'm very tired, Moh

1337
01:40:09,810 --> 01:40:11,810
I had no idea what would happen.

1338
01:40:11,890 --> 01:40:13,810
Question: What are you feeling right now?

1339
01:40:15,960 --> 01:40:18,440
It was sooo scary, but..

1340
01:40:19,120 --> 01:40:23,970
I have 2 things...that need some explanation.

1341
01:40:24,740 --> 01:40:26,000
They are...uh

1342
01:40:27,430 --> 01:40:30,290
Heipo's meaning and..

1343
01:40:33,560 --> 01:40:35,460
My brother's stupid song.

1344
01:40:35,510 --> 01:40:39,050
I still don't know what their meanings are

1345
01:40:39,400 --> 01:40:40,580
Thank you very much.

1346
01:40:49,760 --> 01:40:50,030
Congratulations on the fulfillment of the Batsu Game.

1347
01:40:52,990 --> 01:40:53,510
Good job

1348
01:40:53,560 --> 01:40:54,390
Thank you.

1349
01:40:54,970 --> 01:40:57,770
*Pretending the Batsu Game is over...

1350
01:40:57,770 --> 01:41:04,630
Yamanba (Japanese old woman), appearing from the back of the car.

1351
01:41:09,100 --> 01:41:10,880
Matsumoto Bastu Game
The Best of...

1352
01:42:20,400 --> 01:42:22,990
How many times can you scream ?

1353
01:42:23,690 --> 01:42:25,090
So many "Whaa, whaa"

1354
01:42:26,430 --> 01:42:27,460
Huh ?

1355
01:42:27,820 --> 01:42:31,460
You don't get to hear an over-the-hill screaming out like that these days

1356
01:42:32,960 --> 01:42:34,530
It looked tough, didn't it ?

1357
01:42:34,670 --> 01:42:36,500
Yes, it did

1358
01:42:38,700 --> 01:42:40,300
Well, as you could imagine,

1359
01:42:40,300 --> 01:42:43,570
since I had no prior knowledge about anything,

1360
01:42:44,390 --> 01:42:46,340
everything was scary

1361
01:42:46,740 --> 01:42:49,530
I mean you have no idea what's about to happen

1362
01:42:50,180 --> 01:42:51,900
Yamasaki, you got lost there ?

1363
01:42:52,270 --> 01:42:54,510
I had no idea how to get back

1364
01:42:54,690 --> 01:42:57,110
And I started to get scared, too

1365
01:42:57,110 --> 01:42:58,570
I was like, "Hey I'm done"

1366
01:42:58,950 --> 01:42:59,820
"I am done !"

1367
01:43:01,190 --> 01:43:02,410
But nobody helped me

1368
01:43:02,390 --> 01:43:03,790
And I was hearing him going

1369
01:43:03,870 --> 01:43:05,320
"Hey, I'm done over here !"

1370
01:43:05,440 --> 01:43:08,020
I was getting confused

1371
01:43:09,150 --> 01:43:10,490
This was a tough one

1372
01:43:10,620 --> 01:43:12,910
and I'm glad it's finally over

1373
01:43:13,770 --> 01:43:15,390
I was really dreading to do this

1374
01:43:16,080 --> 01:43:19,920
I'm proposing us never to do this kind of event again

1375
01:43:20,860 --> 01:43:21,760
You mean the "scary" ones ?

1376
01:43:21,810 --> 01:43:23,510
Right, no more

1377
01:43:24,130 --> 01:43:26,400
It's bad for my image

1378
01:43:26,790 --> 01:43:29,530
This will ruin my first meeting at the arranged marriage

1379
01:43:32,910 --> 01:43:34,790
Right, no woman wants to see that of me

1380
01:43:34,860 --> 01:43:36,200
Like this ?

1381
01:43:36,300 --> 01:43:38,670
It sure would be an awkward first date

1382
01:43:42,460 --> 01:43:43,580
I have to say

1383
01:43:43,740 --> 01:43:46,190
we sat here for a long time just to watch this

1384
01:43:46,190 --> 01:43:47,890
It's almost like a feature-length film

1385
01:43:47,890 --> 01:43:50,850
especially the ending where you thought everything was over

1386
01:43:50,850 --> 01:43:51,370
and it wasn't

1387
01:43:51,370 --> 01:43:56,900
This production team is really smart in a most malicious way

1388
01:43:57,080 --> 01:43:59,260
Take this for instance,

1389
01:43:59,280 --> 01:44:01,310
you would think once you shut off the light,

1390
01:44:01,350 --> 01:44:02,670
there would be some scary stuff, right ?

1391
01:44:02,670 --> 01:44:04,760
It's a perfect set-up, right ?

1392
01:44:05,060 --> 01:44:06,340
But no, nothing happened

1393
01:44:06,340 --> 01:44:07,710
And that suspense nearly killed me

1394
01:44:07,710 --> 01:44:09,840
I was like, "Why, why nothing ?"

1395
01:44:10,130 --> 01:44:11,950
Why didn't they do anything then ?

1396
01:44:12,090 --> 01:44:14,920
But they decided to throw in that scary old woman in a morning

1397
01:44:15,070 --> 01:44:16,940
When she got to me like this

1398
01:44:16,940 --> 01:44:19,880
she really got me right here

1399
01:44:20,530 --> 01:44:22,680
She hurt me

1400
01:44:24,210 --> 01:44:25,870
She scratched my side right here

1401
01:44:27,600 --> 01:44:28,790
Oh one last thing,

1402
01:44:28,790 --> 01:44:30,890
we told you the hotel is haunted,

1403
01:44:30,950 --> 01:44:32,850
but it isn't

1404
01:44:33,260 --> 01:44:34,650
They're still in business

1405
01:44:42,400 --> 01:44:44,980
I'm sensing a little contradition here

1406
01:44:45,030 --> 01:44:46,850
Why didn't you tell me that before ?

1407
01:44:46,850 --> 01:44:49,790
We merely rented the whole place out just for the show

1408
01:44:50,510 --> 01:44:52,910
All the talk about the ghost spirits are made-up

1409
01:44:52,910 --> 01:44:54,750
They're a legitimate hotel

1410
01:44:54,750 --> 01:44:56,610
So if I stayed over there again and went to pee

1411
01:44:56,610 --> 01:44:57,590
I wouldn't see that woman now

1412
01:44:57,590 --> 01:44:59,420
No, you won't

1413
01:45:00,260 --> 01:45:02,350
No Fart Cushions ?

1414
01:45:01,470 --> 01:45:02,760
No way

1415
01:45:03,150 --> 01:45:04,280
What if there are hotels like that ?

1416
01:45:04,280 --> 01:45:05,780
It could be a big hit

1417
01:45:05,820 --> 01:45:07,500
Really ?

1418
01:45:06,770 --> 01:45:08,580
It could be a great business model

1419
01:45:08,750 --> 01:45:09,740
I'm not sure about that

1420
01:45:09,740 --> 01:45:12,330
I'm sure it's only cool at first

1421
01:45:12,370 --> 01:45:14,170
I mean nobody wants to go get their own futons

1422
01:45:14,710 --> 01:45:17,000
and also have to deal with the Fart Cushion every time you're back in your room

1423
01:45:17,000 --> 01:45:20,310
"How many times is enough ?"
