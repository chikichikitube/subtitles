00:00:00,280 --> 00:00:04,620
Day off

4
00:00:00,280 --> 00:00:04,620
The Matsumoto family's

5
00:00:04,620 --> 00:00:06,750
Do you know what this is?

6
00:00:06,750 --> 00:00:09,360
Wow, it's an electric eel!

7
00:00:09,360 --> 00:00:11,290
It's an electric eel

8
00:00:10,160 --> 00:00:11,290
Woah, you're right!

9
00:00:11,290 --> 00:00:14,090
It's an electric eel however, isn't it amazing?

10
00:00:14,090 --> 00:00:18,560
About 90% of its body is electric

11
00:00:18,560 --> 00:00:21,700
It's internal organs go like this and contract together

12
00:00:21,700 --> 00:00:24,570
I've seen it on video before

13
00:00:24,570 --> 00:00:26,910
Someone tried swimming past a huge electric eel

14
00:00:26,910 --> 00:00:30,440
and then got electrocuted and just fell dead...

15
00:00:30,440 --> 00:00:33,410
How many volts does it give off?

16
00:00:31,710 --> 00:00:33,410
About 800 volts.

17
00:00:33,410 --> 00:00:35,780
800 volts??

18
00:00:34,510 --> 00:00:35,780
You'd die

19
00:00:35,780 --> 00:00:38,180
You'd die definitely

20
00:00:36,550 --> 00:00:38,180
If you happened to step on one you'd die

21
00:00:38,180 --> 00:00:39,820
It's quite crude isn't it?

22
00:00:39,820 --> 00:00:42,420
So we wanted to let you feel

23
00:00:42,420 --> 00:00:45,430
how the very food we give it feels like

24
00:00:45,430 --> 00:00:48,530
when it gets electrocuted

25
00:00:48,530 --> 00:00:52,570
So we created this thing here...

26
00:00:49,860 --> 00:00:52,570
Oh no this is scary... Electricity?

27
00:00:54,700 --> 00:00:57,370
Huh? What is this?

28
00:00:57,370 --> 00:00:59,610
I have nothing but a bad feeling about this

29
00:00:59,610 --> 00:01:05,580
Experience the feeling of

30
00:00:59,610 --> 00:01:05,580
being attacked by an electric eel

31
00:01:07,720 --> 00:01:10,990
Huh? Is it connected to that over there?

32
00:01:08,950 --> 00:01:10,990
Yes it is

33
00:01:10,990 --> 00:01:12,790
It's linked together

34
00:01:12,790 --> 00:01:14,960
If it's 800 volts It's gonna kill us

35
00:01:14,960 --> 00:01:17,360
Well not really, It's obviously...

36
00:01:16,620 --> 00:01:17,360
Lowered?

37
00:01:17,360 --> 00:01:20,060
Yes, You're gonna get to feel the current together.

38
00:01:20,060 --> 00:01:22,800
Why the hell?

39
00:01:21,760 --> 00:01:22,800
Well, that's what it does.

40
00:01:22,800 --> 00:01:24,470
Are we gonna put our hands in the water here?

41
00:01:24,470 --> 00:01:26,130
Well..

42
00:01:25,030 --> 00:01:26,130
Just one person?

43
00:01:26,130 --> 00:01:27,800
there are two openings but

44
00:01:27,800 --> 00:01:29,670
If you were to do it with 2 hands

45
00:01:29,670 --> 00:01:32,210
the current would be too strong, that's why we do one hand only.

46
00:01:32,210 --> 00:01:35,910
Ugh, okay this is way too scary...

47
00:01:33,880 --> 00:01:35,910
This is so bad!

48
00:01:35,910 --> 00:01:39,310
This is seriously bad. We have to decide this by rock-paper-scissors...

49
00:01:39,310 --> 00:01:42,980
the person who loses HAS to freaking to this.

50
00:01:40,820 --> 00:01:42,980
Let's do guppa first and decide from that

51
00:01:42,980 --> 00:01:45,490
Right, decide the teams first? Okay.

52
00:01:53,460 --> 00:01:56,100
It's always you two, haha

53
00:01:56,100 --> 00:01:58,930
Of course, it's always us...

54
00:01:58,930 --> 00:02:01,770
Now we choose a representitive...

55
00:02:01,770 --> 00:02:04,540
I'll go then

56
00:02:03,740 --> 00:02:04,540
Ok, you go

57
00:02:04,540 --> 00:02:07,710
Imma lose for sure! I won't be able to do it

58
00:02:07,710 --> 00:02:10,050
despite going against the boss

59
00:02:09,080 --> 00:02:10,050
Don't worry you can do it

60
00:02:10,050 --> 00:02:11,610
Kenji, go already

61
00:02:10,980 --> 00:02:11,610
Alright, got it!

62
00:02:11,610 --> 00:02:13,720
Alright we know what's gonna happen let's go

63
00:02:15,850 --> 00:02:19,050
YES!!

64
00:02:19,050 --> 00:02:22,060
We did it!

65
00:02:22,060 --> 00:02:24,260
That was close, I was gonna throw paper...

66
00:02:24,260 --> 00:02:26,830
Hang on a second head chief. Are we really okay?

67
00:02:26,830 --> 00:02:28,060
Yeah you're fine!

68
00:02:28,060 --> 00:02:30,400
He says fine but there's no way...

69
00:02:30,400 --> 00:02:36,370
Just like an electric eel's

70
00:02:30,400 --> 00:02:36,370
Mom and

71
00:02:30,400 --> 00:02:36,370

76
00:02:42,750 --> 00:02:46,220
Wow! This is scary

77
00:02:44,610 --> 00:02:46,220
Put it on the plate..

78
00:02:48,620 --> 00:02:50,220
Oh this is so awful...

79
00:02:50,220 --> 00:02:51,750

00:03:07,440 --> 00:03:09,140
Alright so the food is gonna come out from behind here

86
00:03:09,140 --> 00:03:12,240
Okay, it's dropped

87
00:03:10,110 --> 00:03:12,240
They dropped it now

88
00:03:12,240 --> 00:03:14,080
Oh, it's coming out now

89
00:03:14,080 --> 00:03:16,010
It's looking for it now

90
00:03:16,010 --> 00:03:18,380
It hasn't found it yet

91
00:03:18,380 --> 00:03:20,880
Not yet huh? Is it coming?

This is amazing

107
00:04:38,600 --> 00:04:41,200
This is the first time we see sada like this

108
00:04:39,730 --> 00:04:41,200
It surprised me..

109
00:04:41,200 --> 00:04:44,340
It really did...

110
00:04:44,340 --> 00:04:50,640
I'm so happy we didn't get picked

111
00:04:47,370 --> 00:04:50,640
