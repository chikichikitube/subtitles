00:00:02,580 --> 00:00:07,520
Let's get started with another Wednesday Downtown. Welcome everyone.

5
00:00:05,420 --> 00:00:07,520
Yes, thank you

6
00:00:07,520 --> 00:00:08,670
Shall we begin?

7
00:00:08,670 --> 00:00:11,770
Everyone please welcome our first presenter

8
00:00:17,980 --> 00:00:22,200
Yasuko Mitsuura from Oasis

9
00:00:23,080 --> 00:00:26,120
You're usually over there

10
00:00:24,080 --> 00:00:26,120
Yes, this is my first time on this side

11
00:00:26,120 --> 00:00:28,490
Good evening, thank you for having me

12
00:00:28,490 --> 00:00:31,160
Today it's just, really?

13
00:00:31,160 --> 00:00:35,750
Do I have to dig into this?
It's bound to bring out the worst in women.

14
00:00:35,010 --> 00:00:35,750
Really?

15
00:00:35,750 --> 00:00:39,080
Really. It really is.

16
00:00:36,380 --> 00:00:39,080
You're really pushing it, huh?

17
00:00:39,080 --> 00:00:41,730
The theory I've brought is this-

18
00:00:41,750 --> 00:00:46,290
Theory: If a profile picture has two girls
it belongs to the cute one

19
00:00:46,680 --> 00:00:48,020
That's harsh...

20
00:00:51,600 --> 00:00:53,340
It's heartless~

21
00:00:53,340 --> 00:00:55,680
I think that might be possible

22
00:00:54,370 --> 00:00:55,680
I think it is

23
00:00:55,680 --> 00:00:59,820
Talents can be really bad

24
00:00:56,950 --> 00:00:59,820
Yes, talents and models-

25
00:00:59,820 --> 00:01:02,410
don't seem to be as bad about it

26
00:01:02,410 --> 00:01:06,800
But just look at what they put in their blog posts.

27
00:01:06,800 --> 00:01:11,200
They ask me for a picture to post saying "I worked with Mitsuura-san!"
So they take it-

28
00:01:11,200 --> 00:01:14,490
Then they upload it.
When I go to check it, I'm shocked!

29
00:01:14,490 --> 00:01:18,860
They look absolutely stunning while I stand there with my eyes half-shut

30
00:01:19,770 --> 00:01:21,430
What is with that?

31
00:01:21,430 --> 00:01:26,450
It was like she was thinking "Well as long as I look good".
It's scary, truly.

32
00:01:26,450 --> 00:01:28,040
How about you two?

33
00:01:28,040 --> 00:01:32,080
I think a lot of my friends are similar.
They ask for a picture but-

34
00:01:32,080 --> 00:01:33,180
They only look at themselves

35
00:01:33,180 --> 00:01:34,040
Right?

36
00:01:34,040 --> 00:01:39,320
I think it's best that if you ask for a photo,
you should let them take it for you

37
00:01:39,320 --> 00:01:44,330
I think this is something only moderately cute girls do

38
00:01:44,330 --> 00:01:48,480
Real cute girls have real cute friends

39
00:01:49,750 --> 00:01:55,340
That fastball came out of nowhere-
right into my face

40
00:01:53,230 --> 00:01:55,340
KERPOW, right?

41
00:01:55,340 --> 00:01:57,440
I'm speechless

42
00:01:57,440 --> 00:01:59,860
That's quite an opinion

43
00:01:59,860 --> 00:02:02,610
She just went over your theory with her own

44
00:02:03,310 --> 00:02:09,280
Coming up-
Does the profile picture belong to the cuter girl?

45
00:02:09,280 --> 00:02:10,410
After that-

46
00:02:13,160 --> 00:02:14,690
Can you bunt a home run?

47
00:02:14,690 --> 00:02:16,940
We put it to the test...

48
00:02:16,940 --> 00:02:19,320
...using 300 km/h balls from a pitching machine

49
00:02:20,080 --> 00:02:24,800
Then, can you play telephone game with various genres?

50
00:02:25,740 --> 00:02:31,140
The theory that you are not considered a professional unless you have a perfect knowledge about your signature act

51
00:02:50,970 --> 00:02:53,850
We're investigating the theory that if a profile picture has two girls-

52
00:02:53,850 --> 00:02:57,760
it belongs to the cute one

53
00:02:56,970 --> 00:03:02,010
I wonder if this will end up being true?

54
00:02:58,420 --> 00:03:03,450
First, we searched for girls that have a profile picture with their friend in it

55
00:03:03,450 --> 00:03:08,620
Then we asked nearby boys which is cuter

56
00:03:08,620 --> 00:03:12,240
Finally we'll find out which one is the real owner

57
00:03:12,240 --> 00:03:15,990
Will it be the cute one?

58
00:03:16,990 --> 00:03:19,800
This was the first photo we found

59
00:03:19,800 --> 00:03:24,890
A profile picture with friends, ages 25 and 22

60
00:03:24,890 --> 00:03:29,920
Could you please tell us which of the girls in this photo is cuter?

61
00:03:29,920 --> 00:03:31,830
The left

62
00:03:31,830 --> 00:03:33,980
The one on the left is cutest

63
00:03:33,980 --> 00:03:35,840
Left

64
00:03:35,840 --> 00:03:37,560
The left one?

65
00:03:36,420 --> 00:03:37,560
Yeah

66
00:03:37,560 --> 00:03:41,730
With 3 votes to 0, the streets have chosen the girl on the left

67
00:03:41,730 --> 00:03:45,300
So which one does the profile picture belong to?

68
00:03:47,170 --> 00:03:48,880
Thank you for helping

69
00:03:47,910 --> 00:03:51,720
They got her to come out

70
00:03:49,700 --> 00:03:52,060
What will it be?

71
00:03:56,310 --> 00:04:01,190
Ah, of course it is

72
00:03:57,850 --> 00:04:00,550
It was the cute one

73
00:04:01,060 --> 00:04:05,170
She's cuter in the picture

74
00:04:02,090 --> 00:04:04,820
Why did you use a pair photo here?

75
00:04:03,590 --> 00:04:07,380
You shouldn't say that

76
00:04:04,820 --> 00:04:07,310
To show off my looks

77
00:04:07,310 --> 00:04:10,340
What exactly do you mean by that?

78
00:04:08,920 --> 00:04:12,850
It's her best angle right?

79
00:04:11,280 --> 00:04:14,310
First of all, it's a pretty good photo

80
00:04:14,310 --> 00:04:16,840
But it didn't look very glamorous with me alone

81
00:04:16,840 --> 00:04:16,840
And photo alone doesn't look as cheerful so

82
00:04:16,840 --> 00:04:19,000
"I'm in it with a friend"

83
00:04:19,000 --> 00:04:20,660
"I look pretty"

84
00:04:20,660 --> 00:04:22,250
Those 2 things are-

85
00:04:22,250 --> 00:04:24,730
what I consider

86
00:04:24,730 --> 00:04:26,750
when I decide

87
00:04:27,200 --> 00:04:30,120
By the way, which of you is more popular?

88
00:04:30,120 --> 00:04:34,160
Well, she's younger so she gets more attention

89
00:04:34,160 --> 00:04:35,640
Really?

90
00:04:34,620 --> 00:04:35,640
That's embarrassing

91
00:04:35,640 --> 00:04:38,110
I'm pathetic

92
00:04:39,140 --> 00:04:43,700
She insists she didn't use her friend as a fashion accessory

93
00:04:43,800 --> 00:04:47,410
Around how many guys have asked you out, total?

94
00:04:47,410 --> 00:04:49,920
I haven't been counting, really

95
00:04:49,920 --> 00:04:51,760
Do you have a rough estimate?

96
00:04:51,760 --> 00:04:53,510
It doesn't have to be exact.

97
00:04:53,510 --> 00:04:55,920
Probably around 40 or 50

98
00:04:59,010 --> 00:05:00,990
Isn't that a lot?

99
00:05:01,730 --> 00:05:02,800
Moving on

100
00:05:02,800 --> 00:05:04,940
This pair photo

101
00:05:04,940 --> 00:05:07,020
I think the one on the right is cuter

102
00:05:07,020 --> 00:05:10,010
I also prefer the girl on the right

103
00:05:10,010 --> 00:05:13,220
I also think the girl in center frame is cute

104
00:05:13,220 --> 00:05:16,080
The judgment on the streets is "right"

105
00:05:13,220 --> 00:05:16,080
This is just bad

106
00:05:16,080 --> 00:05:18,210
Sure enough

107
00:05:20,330 --> 00:05:22,040
They're correct after all

108
00:05:22,040 --> 00:05:25,010
This one was also the cuter girl

109
00:05:25,010 --> 00:05:30,910
With this there's a sense that
"Oh, they're such good friends!"

110
00:05:30,050 --> 00:05:34,120
So, good friends

111
00:05:30,910 --> 00:05:33,640
But a selfie kind of screams-

112
00:05:33,640 --> 00:05:38,120
"I'm obsessed with myself"

113
00:05:38,120 --> 00:05:39,180
Next

114
00:05:39,180 --> 00:05:41,460
These two

115
00:05:43,620 --> 00:05:46,420
I'll go with the left one

116
00:05:46,420 --> 00:05:48,570
I also think the left is cuter

117
00:05:48,570 --> 00:05:51,120
I also say left

118
00:05:51,120 --> 00:05:53,940
The decision is the girl on the left,

119
00:05:53,940 --> 00:05:56,230
but usually the profile picture should belong-

120
00:05:56,230 --> 00:06:00,100
to the person in the middle

121
00:05:58,510 --> 00:06:02,020
It could be

122
00:06:00,760 --> 00:06:02,300
Excuse me

123
00:06:03,480 --> 00:06:06,130
Of course

124
00:06:07,990 --> 00:06:10,350
It's the girl on the left

125
00:06:10,560 --> 00:06:12,340
That's freaky~

126
00:06:13,350 --> 00:06:17,240
Although the rate of cute girls using pictures is high,

127
00:06:17,240 --> 00:06:22,810
most of the pair photos we found didn't have much difference in cuteness

128
00:06:22,810 --> 00:06:25,470
Do you think many women-

129
00:06:25,470 --> 00:06:29,320
use pair photos with someone much less attractive?

130
00:06:30,740 --> 00:06:36,220
It somehow exudes the sense that she is obviously cuter

131
00:06:36,220 --> 00:06:37,860
Then, there's-

132
00:06:37,860 --> 00:06:40,610
This pair photo

133
00:06:40,610 --> 00:06:43,280
Could you please pick the cuter girl?

134
00:06:43,280 --> 00:06:45,340
Oh okay

135
00:06:46,960 --> 00:06:48,710
The right one, yo

136
00:06:48,710 --> 00:06:51,010
The one in white, right?

137
00:06:49,590 --> 00:06:51,010
Yeah, that's right

138
00:06:51,010 --> 00:06:52,350
The right

139
00:06:52,350 --> 00:06:54,680
The one in white?
Yes.

140
00:06:54,680 --> 00:06:56,090
The left one

141
00:06:56,090 --> 00:06:56,980
Left?

142
00:06:56,980 --> 00:06:59,960
Without the purikura effect,

143
00:06:59,960 --> 00:07:03,720
I think the girl on the right is going to look worse

144
00:07:03,720 --> 00:07:07,760
This is the first time the decision has split 2-1

145
00:07:07,760 --> 00:07:11,280
So which one is the owner?

146
00:07:11,280 --> 00:07:15,040
Ah, there she is. She's coming.

147
00:07:16,470 --> 00:07:18,360
Hello
Hello

148
00:07:18,360 --> 00:07:22,260
Excuse me, we're from Wednesday Downtown

149
00:07:24,080 --> 00:07:26,040
And so-

150
00:07:31,610 --> 00:07:34,710
We're not sure which girl this is

151
00:07:34,980 --> 00:07:37,330
Which one?

152
00:07:37,830 --> 00:07:39,260
In the purikura machine...

153
00:07:39,260 --> 00:07:41,570
...I pick the cutest one...

154
00:07:41,570 --> 00:07:46,080
from those that we took

155
00:07:46,810 --> 00:07:53,490
Somehow, the purikura created this totally distorted picture of the girl on the right

156
00:07:53,490 --> 00:07:55,080
At this point

157
00:07:55,080 --> 00:07:57,030
It seems less about cuteness

158
00:07:57,030 --> 00:08:00,590
And more about the effects used

159
00:08:01,040 --> 00:08:04,340
Our next photo is this

160
00:08:04,340 --> 00:08:08,090
I think the left is cuter

161
00:08:08,090 --> 00:08:10,900
The left one

162
00:08:10,900 --> 00:08:13,940
By some stroke of fate we ran into this man

163
00:08:13,940 --> 00:08:16,300
Excuse me, excuse me

164
00:08:16,300 --> 00:08:19,340
Haven't you been on TV before?

165
00:08:19,340 --> 00:08:21,030
Have you been on TV?

166
00:08:20,220 --> 00:08:21,030
Yes, I have

167
00:08:21,030 --> 00:08:22,870
Wednesday Downtown

168
00:08:21,600 --> 00:08:22,870
Yes

169
00:08:23,120 --> 00:08:25,980
We're shooting Wednesday Downtown now

170
00:08:24,550 --> 00:08:25,980
Oh really?

171
00:08:26,560 --> 00:08:28,420
That's right, this man is-

172
00:08:28,420 --> 00:08:31,900
Back from spring

173
00:08:29,240 --> 00:08:35,180
the one we met when we were looking for fish-faces
The hippo-face man

174
00:08:35,180 --> 00:08:36,480
What do you do for a living?

175
00:08:36,480 --> 00:08:38,360
Construction worker

176
00:08:38,360 --> 00:08:39,750
Construction?

177
00:08:38,840 --> 00:08:39,750
Yes

178
00:08:39,750 --> 00:08:44,700
You know, I was scouted by a comedy agent

179
00:08:44,700 --> 00:08:47,330
Right now I'm, uh, uh,

180
00:08:47,330 --> 00:08:51,870
I'm doing extra work in comedy productions

181
00:08:52,230 --> 00:08:54,300
Thank you for helping with that theory

182
00:08:53,030 --> 00:08:54,310
Oh yeah, no trouble

183
00:08:54,310 --> 00:08:55,870
What are you doing today?

184
00:08:55,880 --> 00:08:57,800
Well, I have the day off

185
00:08:57,800 --> 00:09:01,410
I go back to work tomorrow night

186
00:09:01,410 --> 00:09:03,610
Sitting in my room all day would be boring

187
00:09:03,610 --> 00:09:05,540
So you're going to Shibuya?

188
00:09:04,170 --> 00:09:05,540
Yeah, that's right

189
00:09:05,540 --> 00:09:09,840
I spend a lot of time in Shibuya when I have a break

190
00:09:10,720 --> 00:09:12,200
Have there been any consequences?

191
00:09:12,200 --> 00:09:15,750
People greet me a lot
If I go to Ikebukoro-

192
00:09:15,750 --> 00:09:18,540
People will even come up-

193
00:09:18,540 --> 00:09:20,140
and ask to take a photo with me

194
00:09:20,140 --> 00:09:21,980
Oh, hello

195
00:09:22,580 --> 00:09:27,620
We ask him, one of our many friends, who is cuter

196
00:09:27,620 --> 00:09:29,790
The left one, yeah?

197
00:09:30,900 --> 00:09:34,790
However, this photo belongs to the girl on the right

198
00:09:35,700 --> 00:09:38,660
And this is what the girl on the left looks like

199
00:09:39,920 --> 00:09:45,250
The purikura effect completely changed them both

200
00:09:45,250 --> 00:09:49,030
And our final photo

201
00:09:49,030 --> 00:09:51,290
The right one

202
00:09:51,290 --> 00:09:52,900
The blond? Interesting

203
00:09:52,900 --> 00:09:54,360
Left

204
00:09:54,970 --> 00:09:56,790
Left

205
00:09:57,660 --> 00:10:00,190
The decision of the street is...

206
00:09:58,720 --> 00:10:02,630
Oh really?

207
00:10:00,190 --> 00:10:02,740
...the woman on the left 2vs1 however...

208
00:10:07,920 --> 00:10:09,830
Sorry, hello

209
00:10:10,360 --> 00:10:12,640
Please come over here

210
00:10:13,580 --> 00:10:15,220
The result is...

211
00:10:19,570 --> 00:10:21,620
Based on the colour of the hair...

212
00:10:21,620 --> 00:10:25,600
...it seems that she is the one on the right

213
00:10:23,540 --> 00:10:27,540
I get why she took it from a high angle

214
00:10:25,600 --> 00:10:28,480
Why did you use a pair shot for your icon?

215
00:10:28,480 --> 00:10:32,450
When you take selfies, I end up touching it up...

216
00:10:32,450 --> 00:10:34,280
...using filters and such

217
00:10:34,280 --> 00:10:37,420
But I get the "You look nothing like that" response a lot

218
00:10:37,420 --> 00:10:40,220
"You look nothing like that"

219
00:10:40,520 --> 00:10:43,030
Stop it!

220
00:10:43,030 --> 00:10:45,150
When I'm alone...

221
00:10:45,150 --> 00:10:47,970
...I get told "That's fraud!" a lot as well

222
00:10:47,970 --> 00:10:51,230
"That's fraud"

223
00:10:51,230 --> 00:10:55,590
With that, the cute one is the user of the photo but...

224
00:10:55,590 --> 00:10:57,920
...profile pictures and reality don't match up

225
00:10:57,920 --> 00:11:01,890
It's amazing, you can't just trust the photos...

226
00:11:01,890 --> 00:11:04,650
...that's the only thing we get from this

227
00:11:04,650 --> 00:11:06,200
It's incredible...

228
00:11:06,200 --> 00:11:08,500
...it makes that much of a difference

229
00:11:08,500 --> 00:11:11,570
Wouldn't it be good to be like "No purikura!"?

230
00:11:12,550 --> 00:11:15,540
In the end, if you just use purikura, from a male perspective...

231
00:11:15,540 --> 00:11:18,690
...they all look cute but if you open the lid...

232
00:11:18,690 --> 00:11:22,400
Wouldn't she end up alone if she continues like this?

233
00:11:22,400 --> 00:11:24,360
Wouldn't it be hard for her to find someone?

234
00:11:24,360 --> 00:11:28,480
I think that's saying too much

235
00:11:30,920 --> 00:11:34,010
Since we had good girls that accepted to do the interview right?

236
00:11:34,010 --> 00:11:37,210
Yes yes, they were open about it so...

237
00:11:37,210 --> 00:11:39,660
But didn't you just think "that's a completely different person"

238
00:11:39,660 --> 00:11:44,330
But, I really thought that her heart was beautiful

239
00:11:44,330 --> 00:11:45,710
No way!?

240
00:11:45,710 --> 00:11:48,860
He said so many thing while watching the video though

241
00:11:48,080 --> 00:11:48,860
Right?

242
00:11:48,860 --> 00:11:54,710
The ones that accepted to go on tv were all lovely people, personality wise

243
00:11:52,450 --> 00:11:54,710
Right the ones that did yes

244
00:11:54,710 --> 00:11:56,160
It's like, uhm...

245
00:11:56,160 --> 00:12:02,630
...we're in an age where small jokes like that wouldn't make them super angry

246
00:12:03,310 --> 00:12:07,640
Next we have the corner where we present and investigate theories from around the world

247
00:12:07,640 --> 00:12:10,200
Viewers' Theory Corner

248
00:12:10,200 --> 00:12:14,320
Tonight's presenter is

249
00:12:14,320 --> 00:12:16,950
It's Tamura Kenji!

250
00:12:16,950 --> 00:12:19,940
Thanks for having me!

251
00:12:21,180 --> 00:12:23,330
The hell is that?

252
00:12:21,870 --> 00:12:23,330
Your hair is crazy

253
00:12:23,330 --> 00:12:24,630
You noticed?

254
00:12:24,630 --> 00:12:25,700
No I mean it's weird...

255
00:12:25,700 --> 00:12:27,900
Did you get a perm or something?

256
00:12:27,900 --> 00:12:30,640
I got a perm...

257
00:12:30,640 --> 00:12:32,660
...and I ended up leaving it...

258
00:12:32,660 --> 00:12:35,090
...and it was pretty funny

259
00:12:36,470 --> 00:12:40,070
We were like "We did it!" with the make-up artist...

260
00:12:40,070 --> 00:12:42,160
"We got a good one"

261
00:12:42,160 --> 00:12:43,540
...and I came in like this

262
00:12:44,350 --> 00:12:46,540
But it wasn't that funny afterall was it?

263
00:12:46,540 --> 00:12:48,900
No it wasn't

264
00:12:47,030 --> 00:12:48,900
It wasn't?

265
00:12:48,900 --> 00:12:51,390
Let's move on. Here is the first theory!

266
00:12:52,470 --> 00:12:56,490
Theory: You can play the Telephone Game with puppets

267
00:12:58,050 --> 00:13:00,890
What do you mean?

268
00:12:58,430 --> 00:13:00,890
You might think to yourself "Hmm?"

269
00:13:00,890 --> 00:13:05,140
The Telephone Game is where you say something to the next person's ear and it goes around...

270
00:13:05,140 --> 00:13:08,780
...however, not using any speech...

271
00:13:08,780 --> 00:13:12,630
...we got professionals of expression together...

272
00:13:12,630 --> 00:13:16,460
...and we made them play the Telephone Game. That's the theory

273
00:13:16,460 --> 00:13:18,160
You mean like drawings and stuff?

274
00:13:18,160 --> 00:13:19,520
Yes exactly

275
00:13:19,520 --> 00:13:22,330
Shall we have a look?

276
00:13:22,330 --> 00:13:23,830
We've got the puppeteer

277
00:13:23,830 --> 00:13:26,370
And a portrait artist

278
00:13:26,370 --> 00:13:28,270
Latte Artist

279
00:13:28,270 --> 00:13:31,200
I think that it'll definitely stop at the latte artist

280
00:13:31,200 --> 00:13:34,390
Can they even make anything more than a panda?

281
00:13:34,390 --> 00:13:36,240
And there's the condescension!

282
00:13:36,240 --> 00:13:38,330
That's not ok

283
00:13:36,670 --> 00:13:38,330
That's no good

284
00:13:38,720 --> 00:13:41,840
That'll piss people off for sure

285
00:13:40,030 --> 00:13:42,980
"Nothing more than a panda?"

286
00:13:41,840 --> 00:13:44,220
We're experienced in that

287
00:13:42,980 --> 00:13:44,220
We are!

288
00:13:44,220 --> 00:13:47,170
How did you experience it?

289
00:13:45,220 --> 00:13:47,170
The cymbal theory, cymbal

290
00:13:47,170 --> 00:13:50,480
People were really pissed off at me for making fun of the cymbal guy

291
00:13:50,480 --> 00:13:53,160
Right?

292
00:13:51,120 --> 00:13:53,160
Yeah!

293
00:13:53,160 --> 00:13:57,820
We're investigating the theory that you can play the Telephone Game with puppets

294
00:13:58,520 --> 00:14:00,200
With that, this time...

295
00:14:00,200 --> 00:14:04,850
we will have these six pros from different genres, including the puppeteer

296
00:14:04,850 --> 00:14:09,640
communicate an idea using just their proficiencies

297
00:14:09,640 --> 00:14:12,050
If the theme that was given by Announcer Kuniyama

298
00:14:12,050 --> 00:14:15,230
manages to go through to Announcer Yoshida at the end

299
00:14:15,230 --> 00:14:18,400
we will have proven the theory.

300
00:14:15,230 --> 00:14:19,290
Oh the first one is drawing as expected

301
00:14:18,880 --> 00:14:22,280
The theme is this

302
00:14:22,280 --> 00:14:25,110
Antonio Inoki hitting a homerun

303
00:14:25,110 --> 00:14:28,220
This is impossible!

304
00:14:28,220 --> 00:14:30,690
Are you ready?

305
00:14:29,090 --> 00:14:30,180
Yes

306
00:14:30,690 --> 00:14:34,710
With that, please get started on your craft

307
00:14:34,710 --> 00:14:39,950
At first, we start with the portrait artist

308
00:14:39,950 --> 00:14:43,430
How long does it usually take for you to draw one picture?

309
00:14:43,430 --> 00:14:48,350
Usually, if it's just the face, I draw in a bout 10 minutes

310
00:14:46,400 --> 00:14:48,350
About 10 minutes

311
00:14:48,350 --> 00:14:50,280
Are you confident in yourself?

312
00:14:50,280 --> 00:14:52,320
Uuhmm, yeah...

313
00:14:52,320 --> 00:14:56,090
...I want them to at least understand the person, since it's a portrait

314
00:14:56,090 --> 00:14:58,650
Fifteen minutes since the start,

315
00:14:58,650 --> 00:15:01,480
The end result is here

316
00:14:58,740 --> 00:15:03,010
This is really important

317
00:15:01,480 --> 00:15:05,270
Yes, something like this...

318
00:15:07,830 --> 00:15:09,620
Where are the important points exactly?

319
00:15:09,620 --> 00:15:10,690
The points are

320
00:15:10,690 --> 00:15:13,410
you'd have to understand that it's "this person"

321
00:15:13,410 --> 00:15:16,480
So the red scarf

322
00:15:16,480 --> 00:15:20,110
and that you can see his satisfaction with the homerun

323
00:15:20,110 --> 00:15:20,830
I see

324
00:15:20,830 --> 00:15:23,200
Yeah you can see the point being given too

325
00:15:23,200 --> 00:15:27,120
I kind of tried to squeeze it all in

326
00:15:27,120 --> 00:15:31,640
And when she shows it to the pantomime...

327
00:15:31,640 --> 00:15:34,080
Wouldn't it be okay with a pantomime?

328
00:15:31,640 --> 00:15:34,170
Alright!

329
00:15:34,170 --> 00:15:36,720
Did you understand what it was?

330
00:15:35,390 --> 00:15:36,720
I did

331
00:15:36,720 --> 00:15:39,000
Uhm, Mr. Inoki is...

332
00:15:39,000 --> 00:15:40,870
...in a game of baseball...

333
00:15:40,870 --> 00:15:42,580
...hitting a homerun

334
00:15:44,910 --> 00:15:51,080
With that, the Telephone Pantomime begins

335
00:15:57,670 --> 00:16:00,300
It's not that funny

336
00:16:03,360 --> 00:16:05,440
Wouldn't he get it?

337
00:16:05,210 --> 00:16:09,170
She brings up the characteristic chin with her hand movements...

338
00:16:10,000 --> 00:16:12,990
...1, 2, 3...

339
00:16:12,990 --> 00:16:14,360
...Da! movement...

340
00:16:14,360 --> 00:16:18,100
...to relay that it's Inoki

341
00:16:18,100 --> 00:16:20,590
And then...

342
00:16:30,440 --> 00:16:32,770
She's pretty good

343
00:16:33,470 --> 00:16:35,810
She brings the pose again huh?

344
00:16:33,880 --> 00:16:35,110
Are you alright?

345
00:16:35,110 --> 00:16:36,450
Yes

346
00:16:36,910 --> 00:16:41,280
Next is latte art

347
00:16:37,950 --> 00:16:41,870
This is where we might have problems

348
00:16:41,280 --> 00:16:42,580
What are you exactly doing?

349
00:16:42,580 --> 00:16:46,270
I'm first building the silhouette...

350
00:16:46,270 --> 00:16:48,420
...with that the contour?

351
00:16:48,420 --> 00:16:53,100
Right, this is chocolate sauce, to draw on the details

352
00:16:54,470 --> 00:16:58,330
15 minutes passed working on their craft

353
00:16:58,330 --> 00:17:00,470
I'm done

354
00:17:00,470 --> 00:17:01,650
This is...

355
00:17:01,650 --> 00:17:03,550
What did you draw?

356
00:17:03,550 --> 00:17:08,400
This is the scene of Antonio Inoki hitting a homerun

357
00:17:10,860 --> 00:17:13,330
Why did you divide it to two cups?

358
00:17:13,330 --> 00:17:15,630
If you draw things too small...

359
00:17:13,760 --> 00:17:16,250
Oh my god, I'm sorry...

360
00:17:15,630 --> 00:17:19,260
...the portrait would end up unrecognizable, since the canvas is so small

361
00:17:19,260 --> 00:17:21,920
...so I thought about increasing the canvases

362
00:17:21,920 --> 00:17:26,400
Since the chin is very characteristic...

363
00:17:26,400 --> 00:17:32,160
...and also his red towel. I wanted to show that it's Antonio Inoki...

364
00:17:32,160 --> 00:17:33,770
...to make them understand

365
00:17:33,770 --> 00:17:36,270
And drawing the ball flying away...

366
00:17:36,270 --> 00:17:38,520
...on my second cup

367
00:17:38,520 --> 00:17:40,310
I'm hoping that this is understandable by the next person

368
00:17:40,310 --> 00:17:42,080
I see

369
00:17:42,080 --> 00:17:46,920
The puppeteer, seeing this work of art...

370
00:17:48,530 --> 00:17:51,040
Antonio Inoki is...

371
00:17:51,040 --> 00:17:52,700
...playing baseball

372
00:17:54,830 --> 00:17:56,010
That's your answer correct?

373
00:17:56,010 --> 00:17:56,630
Yes

374
00:17:56,630 --> 00:17:59,930
That is what you understood

375
00:17:57,640 --> 00:17:59,930
Yes, it is

376
00:17:59,930 --> 00:18:05,340
The homerun aspect of the question was lost at this point

377
00:18:04,020 --> 00:18:06,560
This could comeback somehow

378
00:18:05,340 --> 00:18:09,920
Please start explaining the theme to the next person

379
00:18:30,630 --> 00:18:35,030
Here also, we get the hand movements to show the chin...

380
00:18:35,030 --> 00:18:39,350
...trying to do the "Da!" but...

381
00:18:39,350 --> 00:18:40,450
1

382
00:18:40,450 --> 00:18:41,670
2

383
00:18:41,670 --> 00:18:43,840
Da!

384
00:18:44,690 --> 00:18:48,520
She forgot the "3"

385
00:18:48,520 --> 00:18:50,810
Also...

386
00:18:56,860 --> 00:18:59,920
Is it a bit tough?

387
00:19:01,550 --> 00:19:04,440
It's like a bunt

388
00:19:02,640 --> 00:19:03,610
Okay

389
00:19:05,850 --> 00:19:10,520
What did the fifth person get from the puppet's movements

390
00:19:10,520 --> 00:19:12,200
Please show it

391
00:19:12,500 --> 00:19:14,670
It ended up like this

392
00:19:14,670 --> 00:19:18,080
A batter looking to hit

393
00:19:18,080 --> 00:19:20,450
a very fast ball

394
00:19:22,570 --> 00:19:27,740
With the puppet, we completely lost Inoki

395
00:19:27,740 --> 00:19:32,520
But by some miracle, the homerun idea came back

396
00:19:33,650 --> 00:19:36,420
Let's make another miracle and get Inoki back!

397
00:19:33,970 --> 00:19:37,910
The balloon artist seeing this

398
00:19:38,180 --> 00:19:41,730
Would he've been able to make Inoki with balloons anyway?

399
00:19:43,920 --> 00:19:45,740
Do you have a clear image in your head?

400
00:19:45,740 --> 00:19:49,200
I'll be thinking about it while making it

401
00:19:50,000 --> 00:19:54,300
After 20 minutes of hard work

402
00:19:54,300 --> 00:19:55,950
Yes, I'm done

403
00:19:55,950 --> 00:19:57,840
What are you trying to convey?

404
00:19:57,840 --> 00:20:02,750
A batter trying to hit a fastball

405
00:20:02,880 --> 00:20:05,050
This is amazing though...

406
00:20:05,050 --> 00:20:10,350
Basically I wanted to depict the motion of a fast thrown ball

407
00:20:10,350 --> 00:20:12,490
by creating this spiral thing.

408
00:20:12,490 --> 00:20:16,430
The face looks a bit like Downtown's Matsumoto.

409
00:20:15,960 --> 00:20:17,490
It's true they look alike...

410
00:20:16,430 --> 00:20:18,600
Yes, this is just something I did for fun...

411
00:20:19,230 --> 00:20:21,670
For the sake of fun,

412
00:20:21,670 --> 00:20:25,040
the Matsumoto element appeared into the sequence.

413
00:20:23,100 --> 00:20:24,800
Yeah but...

414
00:20:24,800 --> 00:20:28,010
He thought too much about the show.

415
00:20:25,440 --> 00:20:26,800
As a result...

416
00:20:26,600 --> 00:20:28,010
He really did.

417
00:20:28,640 --> 00:20:30,540
Nice to meet you!

418
00:20:30,940 --> 00:20:32,540
Balloons right?

419
00:20:34,080 --> 00:20:37,510
Yoshida should get it at once....

420
00:20:37,510 --> 00:20:38,850
However...

421
00:20:39,320 --> 00:20:41,450
Yes, I got it.

422
00:20:40,320 --> 00:20:42,320
The ring shoes and the pants are definitely saying Inoki!

423
00:20:41,450 --> 00:20:46,490
Announcer Yoshida, please tell us your answer!

424
00:20:42,320 --> 00:20:43,890
Is it so?

425
00:20:43,020 --> 00:20:43,890
Yeah

426
00:20:47,290 --> 00:20:49,430
A blond

427
00:20:49,430 --> 00:20:51,960
baseball player

428
00:20:51,960 --> 00:20:54,270
hits

429
00:20:54,270 --> 00:20:55,100
a flying ball

430
00:20:55,100 --> 00:20:57,500
with a bat.

431
00:20:57,500 --> 00:21:00,500
Unfortunately, this is wrong!

432
00:21:01,610 --> 00:21:05,080
And with that, the elements "Inoki" and "homerun" disappear,

433
00:21:02,910 --> 00:21:04,280
It would end up like this...

434
00:21:06,110 --> 00:21:09,310
the element of Matsumoto also wasn't mentioned.

435
00:21:09,880 --> 00:21:11,350
This is embarrassing isn't it.

436
00:21:12,250 --> 00:21:14,750
And so, a second try after some changes...

437
00:21:14,320 --> 00:21:16,890
It definitely can be done

438
00:21:15,890 --> 00:21:22,490
This time they discussed an approach that should result in success.

439
00:21:16,890 --> 00:21:18,560
They should change the order

440
00:21:22,030 --> 00:21:22,960
Yeah right?

441
00:21:22,960 --> 00:21:25,230
The marionette is the point here...

442
00:21:23,230 --> 00:21:24,930
And the outcome...

443
00:21:25,700 --> 00:21:28,430
The first half consists of the illustrating artists,

444
00:21:27,530 --> 00:21:28,430
Is that so...

445
00:21:28,430 --> 00:21:32,740
and the more difficult genres are put towards the end.

446
00:21:33,240 --> 00:21:35,670
And so the second phrase is...

447
00:21:35,470 --> 00:21:36,270
Tricky!

448
00:21:36,270 --> 00:21:38,840
A gorilla that failed the exams.

449
00:21:55,990 --> 00:21:57,900
The second phrase is...

450
00:21:57,900 --> 00:21:58,900
That's tricky!

451
00:21:58,330 --> 00:22:01,100
A gorilla that failed the exams.

452
00:22:01,030 --> 00:22:02,100
The phrase...

453
00:22:01,930 --> 00:22:04,840
First, what the portrait artist created...

454
00:22:02,100 --> 00:22:03,970
They don't even take exams

455
00:22:03,970 --> 00:22:05,040
Cute...

456
00:22:04,840 --> 00:22:07,940
This is the large gorilla realizing...

457
00:22:07,940 --> 00:22:10,770
the exam part is shown through the sakura

458
00:22:10,770 --> 00:22:13,540
but since it's a fail the sakura petals have fallen.

459
00:22:13,380 --> 00:22:15,280
This is difficult!

460
00:22:13,540 --> 00:22:15,610
But this wouldn't be enough to understand,

461
00:22:15,610 --> 00:22:20,550
so I show that his exam number is missing from the pass list.

462
00:22:19,250 --> 00:22:21,020
I see...

463
00:22:21,150 --> 00:22:23,920
The latte artist who sees this...

464
00:22:25,090 --> 00:22:26,960
A gorilla that failed the exams.

465
00:22:28,290 --> 00:22:29,660
100 points!

466
00:22:29,660 --> 00:22:31,600
This one's good!

467
00:22:30,460 --> 00:22:31,600
Yeah he is great!

468
00:22:31,600 --> 00:22:36,900
And so, this illustration is recreated with latte art.

469
00:22:35,130 --> 00:22:36,900
This is amazing!!

470
00:22:36,900 --> 00:22:39,270
The latte artist is definitely underrated...

471
00:22:37,370 --> 00:22:40,770
And the collage artist that saw this...

472
00:22:39,270 --> 00:22:41,640
Yeah we were making fun of him

473
00:22:41,570 --> 00:22:44,210
Playing sevens (card game)...

474
00:22:44,210 --> 00:22:44,980
monkey!

475
00:22:45,810 --> 00:22:47,850
A missed interpretation.

476
00:22:46,040 --> 00:22:47,410
Why??

477
00:22:47,410 --> 00:22:48,710
Why sevens??

478
00:22:48,350 --> 00:22:50,810
And by creating that collage...

479
00:22:49,280 --> 00:22:50,950
What is he doing?

480
00:22:50,080 --> 00:22:52,750
He missed clues like the sakura petals...

481
00:22:51,480 --> 00:22:54,520
Next, the balloon artist...

482
00:22:52,480 --> 00:22:54,450
The sakura...

483
00:22:54,520 --> 00:22:57,420
It's a monkey playing card games

484
00:22:57,790 --> 00:23:01,990
He got this correct, however

485
00:22:57,890 --> 00:22:59,620
So it turned into a monkey...

486
00:22:59,620 --> 00:23:00,990
But he made it very well

487
00:23:01,290 --> 00:23:02,890
It's great, though

488
00:23:01,290 --> 00:23:02,890
Yeah, indeed

489
00:23:03,190 --> 00:23:05,760
The pantomime who saw this...

490
00:23:06,060 --> 00:23:09,230
A gorilla that plays sevens

491
00:23:09,230 --> 00:23:11,440
The point where he finds seven!

492
00:23:12,540 --> 00:23:15,340
Somehow, "gorilla" comes back into the sequence...

493
00:23:14,510 --> 00:23:16,410
The gorilla part is correct.

494
00:23:19,640 --> 00:23:22,010
A gorilla playing cards.

495
00:23:22,080 --> 00:23:23,410
Gorilla was correct.

496
00:23:23,410 --> 00:23:24,980
But this as gorilla...

497
00:23:26,780 --> 00:23:30,450
Equally far from both a gorilla and playing cards...

498
00:23:30,450 --> 00:23:35,330
the japanese style marionette is struggling fruitlessly.

499
00:23:34,590 --> 00:23:36,560
How will that work?

500
00:23:35,930 --> 00:23:38,630
A gorilla....

501
00:23:38,260 --> 00:23:39,330
This is on point!

502
00:23:38,630 --> 00:23:41,200
sits down after an act of intimidation...

503
00:23:41,200 --> 00:23:42,800
and eats...

504
00:23:42,800 --> 00:23:44,070
a banana.

505
00:23:43,300 --> 00:23:44,970
What the hell is this!

506
00:23:44,070 --> 00:23:46,900
Unfortunately, it's a miss!

507
00:23:47,200 --> 00:23:49,970
It's the paper guy's fault

508
00:23:48,170 --> 00:23:52,710
And so the conclusion is, the telephone game is difficult.

509
00:23:52,140 --> 00:23:53,580
Well yeah...

510
00:23:53,480 --> 00:23:56,810
It was pretty close right?

511
00:23:55,480 --> 00:23:56,810
It was...

512
00:23:56,810 --> 00:23:59,650
But the latte artist was great right?

513
00:23:58,580 --> 00:23:59,650
He was!

514
00:23:59,650 --> 00:24:00,620
He was amazing right...

515
00:24:00,620 --> 00:24:01,990
...Kawakita-san?

516
00:24:01,990 --> 00:24:04,220
I sincerely apologise.

517
00:24:04,220 --> 00:24:05,720
Aren't ya going to Harajuku?

518
00:24:05,720 --> 00:24:08,860
It was really amazing!

519
00:24:06,920 --> 00:24:08,860
It really was,

520
00:24:08,860 --> 00:24:11,330
and even more it being in colour.

521
00:24:10,390 --> 00:24:11,330
Yeah, exactly.

522
00:24:11,330 --> 00:24:14,770
However, I didn't hear anything about using two cups...

523
00:24:16,230 --> 00:24:20,300
Are you upset because there was no reaction to that guy making your face?

524
00:24:20,300 --> 00:24:21,540
It's not that...

525
00:24:23,540 --> 00:24:27,510
So let's move on to the next theory! The theory is as follows:

526
00:24:28,610 --> 00:24:33,550
The theory that one should have a perfect knowledge of their signature act or are not considered a professional.

527
00:24:35,120 --> 00:24:36,090
What could that mean...

528
00:24:36,090 --> 00:24:41,460
Well there might be several acts that someone possesses, however, if money is made out of one signature act,

529
00:24:41,460 --> 00:24:45,600
then you really need to have perfect knowledge of that specific act,

530
00:24:46,100 --> 00:24:48,570
otherwise it is not good.

531
00:24:48,570 --> 00:24:49,870
In other words,

532
00:24:49,870 --> 00:24:52,140
for example Degawa-san the comedian

533
00:24:52,140 --> 00:24:54,240
has an act called "the nose crayfish".

534
00:24:54,240 --> 00:24:58,810
If that's the case then do you know the shishimai (lion dance) perfectly?

535
00:24:58,810 --> 00:25:00,810
Well that is obvious Hamada-san!

536
00:25:00,810 --> 00:25:02,610
Bringing it up regularly...

537
00:25:01,350 --> 00:25:02,610
It is so obvious...

538
00:25:02,610 --> 00:25:04,650
I really feel obliged towards it

539
00:25:04,650 --> 00:25:07,250
Since when does this tradition exist?

540
00:25:05,580 --> 00:25:07,250
Right, right

541
00:25:07,250 --> 00:25:08,820
Is that a japanese thing to begin with?

542
00:25:08,820 --> 00:25:09,890
Yeah, who started doing it...

543
00:25:09,890 --> 00:25:12,220
Is it from Chinatown?

544
00:25:10,450 --> 00:25:12,220
Who started doing it first?

545
00:25:12,220 --> 00:25:15,130
If you say it at once like that then I can't answer!

546
00:25:15,130 --> 00:25:18,830
I do have the answer but if I am told suddenly like that...

547
00:25:17,430 --> 00:25:18,830
WHY??

548
00:25:20,130 --> 00:25:22,400
I panicked. I really panic.

549
00:25:22,970 --> 00:25:25,940
Then I will answer only one question.

550
00:25:24,540 --> 00:25:25,940
Your signature act...

551
00:25:24,900 --> 00:25:25,940
Only one?

552
00:25:25,940 --> 00:25:27,240
The question from Harry-kun

553
00:25:27,240 --> 00:25:30,670
To begin with, please tell us if it's a japanese thing.

554
00:25:30,670 --> 00:25:31,540
I've heard...

555
00:25:31,540 --> 00:25:36,980
that it has been brought from China.

556
00:25:38,520 --> 00:25:39,780
It exists in China too, right?

557
00:25:39,780 --> 00:25:42,290
So how long ago did it come to Japan?

558
00:25:40,580 --> 00:25:42,290
You mean how many years ago?

559
00:25:42,290 --> 00:25:43,350
Well yeah historically.

560
00:25:43,350 --> 00:25:46,360
Do you gain anything from knowing that?

561
00:25:46,360 --> 00:25:48,230
Well it's about this theory now...

562
00:25:48,230 --> 00:25:49,630
Read the title!

563
00:25:49,630 --> 00:25:50,390
It's there!

564
00:25:50,830 --> 00:25:57,400
You are not considered a professional unless you have a perfect knowledge about your signature act.

565
00:25:58,140 --> 00:26:00,170
So this time

566
00:26:00,170 --> 00:26:02,340
we have invited comedians who

567
00:26:02,340 --> 00:26:05,740
rely on either props or phrases as their signature act.

568
00:26:06,410 --> 00:26:10,410
To prevent complications, we invited them over for a fake project.

569
00:26:10,950 --> 00:26:15,390
We then ask them ten questions regarding their signature acts.

570
00:26:15,390 --> 00:26:18,420
If all questions are answered correctly the theory is confirmed.

571
00:26:18,220 --> 00:26:19,360
Oh I see...

572
00:26:19,360 --> 00:26:21,930
The first contestant is..

573
00:26:22,430 --> 00:26:23,960
Nice to meet you!

574
00:26:24,430 --> 00:26:26,260
Nagano-san!

575
00:26:27,730 --> 00:26:28,530
Nice to be h...

576
00:26:29,570 --> 00:26:31,570
Comedian Nagano.

577
00:26:30,870 --> 00:26:33,540
What was his thing?

578
00:26:31,970 --> 00:26:34,070
When you think about this man...

579
00:26:33,540 --> 00:26:34,970
Right, it was Rassen...

580
00:26:34,070 --> 00:26:35,570
I simply....

581
00:26:35,570 --> 00:26:38,480
LIKE RASSEN!!!

582
00:26:38,680 --> 00:26:43,380
A repeated calling of Rassen (a painter) during his act.

583
00:26:43,780 --> 00:26:47,220
Does he have an understanding about Rassen?

584
00:26:45,820 --> 00:26:47,620
He's says it alot too

585
00:26:47,220 --> 00:26:48,450
Nagano-san...

586
00:26:48,450 --> 00:26:50,850
you like Rassen right?

587
00:26:49,450 --> 00:26:50,850
I like him!

588
00:26:50,850 --> 00:26:52,190
Isn't that so?

589
00:26:51,120 --> 00:26:52,190
I LOVE HIM!

590
00:26:52,190 --> 00:26:54,990
I LIKE RASSEN!!!!!!!

591
00:26:54,990 --> 00:26:57,560
...and with this

592
00:26:57,560 --> 00:27:00,660
Rassen quiz!!!!

593
00:27:00,160 --> 00:27:01,570
This will be entertaining!

594
00:27:01,570 --> 00:27:02,370
Huh?

595
00:27:03,500 --> 00:27:05,570
Let's see the first question

596
00:27:05,570 --> 00:27:06,940
Well he was caught by surprise so...

597
00:27:05,570 --> 00:27:07,700
Please take a look at this

598
00:27:08,140 --> 00:27:13,340
Which of these paintings is made by Rassen?

599
00:27:11,710 --> 00:27:14,240
It's difficult!

600
00:27:13,340 --> 00:27:16,580
Please answer with A, B or C.

601
00:27:16,580 --> 00:27:19,280
Only one is rassen

602
00:27:17,710 --> 00:27:19,280
Ah, I got this one!

603
00:27:20,480 --> 00:27:21,550
Yes, Nagano-san?

604
00:27:22,790 --> 00:27:23,550
That's it right?

605
00:27:23,820 --> 00:27:25,460
Simply because

606
00:27:25,460 --> 00:27:27,360
I have seen this painting

607
00:27:27,520 --> 00:27:29,430
That's correct!

608
00:27:29,660 --> 00:27:32,000
Do you own any of Rassen's paintings?

609
00:27:32,400 --> 00:27:33,630
I bought some, yeah

610
00:27:33,830 --> 00:27:35,830
I was made to buy.. I bou... yes I have bought

611
00:27:35,830 --> 00:27:37,100
I have bought, yes

612
00:27:37,800 --> 00:27:41,570
During a show he purchased a 620.000 yen painting

613
00:27:41,570 --> 00:27:44,780
He got the correct answer!

614
00:27:44,780 --> 00:27:45,880
And with this...

615
00:27:45,880 --> 00:27:49,750
continuing the Rassen quiz, here is the next question:

616
00:27:49,750 --> 00:27:53,050
Who is Rassen?

617
00:27:52,680 --> 00:27:53,980
Eee, is he gonna know this?

618
00:27:53,980 --> 00:27:55,120
He knows this doesn't he?

619
00:27:55,120 --> 00:27:55,920
Somehow....

620
00:27:56,150 --> 00:27:57,390
it's very easy for me

621
00:27:57,750 --> 00:28:01,590
Last year I actually met Rassen

622
00:28:01,590 --> 00:28:02,990
Are you ready?

623
00:28:03,330 --> 00:28:04,130
Naganosan? B!

624
00:28:03,590 --> 00:28:05,000
He actually knows this

625
00:28:05,730 --> 00:28:06,830
Why did you choose B?

626
00:28:06,830 --> 00:28:09,100
I said I met him!

627
00:28:13,200 --> 00:28:14,770
Correct!

628
00:28:13,670 --> 00:28:14,770
See!?

629
00:28:14,770 --> 00:28:16,240
Congratulations!

630
00:28:16,840 --> 00:28:21,910
In this case, he met with Rassen during work, so he got the answer.

631
00:28:20,840 --> 00:28:21,910
Well he said he met him

632
00:28:21,910 --> 00:28:23,780
Here is the next question:

633
00:28:23,780 --> 00:28:28,490
What thing related to Rassen does NOT exist?

634
00:28:28,490 --> 00:28:33,420
A: An amusement park attraction, Ocean Rassen The Ride

635
00:28:33,420 --> 00:28:37,660
B: A pachinko place, CR Rassen World.

636
00:28:37,660 --> 00:28:41,800
C: A game software, Rassen Art Collection.

637
00:28:37,930 --> 00:28:39,100
What is that?

638
00:28:41,800 --> 00:28:43,870
It's starting to get a bit difficult...

639
00:28:41,800 --> 00:28:45,040
Eh, two exist? Yes.

640
00:28:43,000 --> 00:28:45,040
The two really exist.

641
00:28:44,000 --> 00:28:45,770
Ah so the two exist.

642
00:28:47,770 --> 00:28:49,870
So two are real..

643
00:28:50,010 --> 00:28:51,110
Naganosan?

644
00:28:52,140 --> 00:28:56,710
So the amusement park attraction doesn't exist.

645
00:28:55,350 --> 00:28:56,710
No I don't think it does.

646
00:28:55,980 --> 00:28:57,150
It does sound real though.

647
00:28:57,350 --> 00:28:58,750
You are correct!

648
00:28:59,180 --> 00:29:00,850
Yeeesss!!!!

649
00:29:01,150 --> 00:29:06,790
The pachinko place "CR Rassen World" opened in 2006.

650
00:29:06,990 --> 00:29:09,460
And who played there...

651
00:29:08,990 --> 00:29:09,730
I don't know that...

652
00:29:09,460 --> 00:29:15,030
The first game software of the Rassen Art collection is the digital jigsaw puzzle.

653
00:29:09,730 --> 00:29:10,790
Who knows that!

654
00:29:15,570 --> 00:29:16,600
I see...

655
00:29:17,070 --> 00:29:19,040
Somehow this man...

656
00:29:19,400 --> 00:29:22,270
"I LIKE RASSEN!!!"

657
00:29:22,740 --> 00:29:24,670
whether that's true or not...

658
00:29:24,670 --> 00:29:28,610
he is naturally very strong in the Rassen quiz.

659
00:29:26,780 --> 00:29:27,840
Amazing !

660
00:29:28,610 --> 00:29:30,780
Let's roll to the next question.

661
00:29:30,780 --> 00:29:34,680
Where was Rassen born?

662
00:29:34,680 --> 00:29:36,750
A: Hawaii

663
00:29:36,750 --> 00:29:38,120
...It is right?

664
00:29:36,750 --> 00:29:38,920
B: California

665
00:29:38,920 --> 00:29:40,960
C: Australia

666
00:29:41,830 --> 00:29:42,960
Nagano-san

667
00:29:42,360 --> 00:29:42,960
Hawaii!

668
00:29:44,900 --> 00:29:47,030
I think for Rassen...

669
00:29:47,030 --> 00:29:49,270
the majority of the paintings

670
00:29:49,270 --> 00:29:50,530
are inspired by sea.

671
00:29:53,340 --> 00:29:54,140
Nagano-san

672
00:29:55,170 --> 00:29:57,140
Unfortunately, it's the wrong answer.

673
00:29:57,810 --> 00:30:00,610
The correct answer is B: California

674
00:30:00,750 --> 00:30:04,280
Unfortunately it was a miss and therefore you will receive a punishment.

675
00:30:04,280 --> 00:30:06,910
HEY NAGANOOOO!!!!

676
00:30:08,200 --> 00:30:11,960
You son of a bitch, you like Rassen right?

677
00:30:11,960 --> 00:30:13,430
That hurt!

678
00:30:11,980 --> 00:30:13,430
Isn't that so?

679
00:30:13,430 --> 00:30:15,620
You like Rassen?

680
00:30:14,350 --> 00:30:17,130
Typical Aja Kong...

681
00:30:17,310 --> 00:30:18,570
WHAT IS THIS??

682
00:30:18,570 --> 00:30:21,310
What the hell is this you're supposed to like Rassen!

683
00:30:22,440 --> 00:30:23,770
I'm seriously scared!

684
00:30:23,770 --> 00:30:26,000
Say it properly that you like Rassen!

685
00:30:26,000 --> 00:30:29,170
I LIKE RASSEN!!!!!!

686
00:30:29,950 --> 00:30:31,810
What is this?

687
00:30:32,520 --> 00:30:36,340
Unfortunately Nagano failed on the fourth question.

688
00:30:36,340 --> 00:30:40,240
And the next  challenger is...

689
00:30:36,340 --> 00:30:41,420
But I think he really tried.

690
00:30:41,410 --> 00:30:44,250
Nice to meet you!!

691
00:30:46,560 --> 00:30:48,230
Gorgeous!

692
00:30:47,930 --> 00:30:50,490
Suddenly his face changed...

693
00:30:48,870 --> 00:30:51,080
Mada tasukaru, ma tasukaru, ma tasukaru (We'll be saved, we'll be saved)!!

694
00:30:51,080 --> 00:30:53,260
Madagasukaru (Madagascar)!!

695
00:30:53,840 --> 00:30:56,260
The one who everyday points at that island...

696
00:30:56,260 --> 00:31:01,610
Madagascar, but how much does he really know about it?

697
00:31:01,610 --> 00:31:03,940
You really picked a good one here

698
00:31:04,480 --> 00:31:08,020
Gorgeous you are always mentioning

699
00:31:08,020 --> 00:31:11,590
a country-island on the African coast

700
00:31:10,880 --> 00:31:13,400
That's how it came!

701
00:31:11,590 --> 00:31:13,740
MADAGASCAR!!

702
00:31:13,740 --> 00:31:14,800
And with that...

703
00:31:14,800 --> 00:31:20,940
I know about it naturally- Madagascar quiz!!

704
00:31:22,820 --> 00:31:25,560
Do you have a good knowledge of Madagascar?

705
00:31:25,560 --> 00:31:29,580
Well yes I make sure to point at it correctly everytime.

706
00:31:29,220 --> 00:31:31,300
Well at least he knows where it is located.

707
00:31:29,580 --> 00:31:32,880
So the first question is:

708
00:31:33,720 --> 00:31:37,680
Which of these is Madagascar?

709
00:31:34,270 --> 00:31:38,470
He should be able to answer this.

710
00:31:37,680 --> 00:31:40,040
I think I can answer this.

711
00:31:40,120 --> 00:31:42,740
He points at it so he should know.

712
00:31:40,480 --> 00:31:41,850
Gorgeous-san?

713
00:31:43,930 --> 00:31:46,920
I even looked and pointed at it earlier.

714
00:31:46,920 --> 00:31:50,030
Unfortunately it is incorrect!

715
00:31:50,030 --> 00:31:52,280
You're joking! You're joking

716
00:31:52,600 --> 00:31:53,880
A is...

717
00:31:53,760 --> 00:31:56,440
It's B...

718
00:31:53,880 --> 00:31:55,640
Taiwan

719
00:31:56,470 --> 00:31:57,940
That's a joke!

720
00:31:57,940 --> 00:32:02,590
Please check with your own eyes the shape of it

721
00:32:01,000 --> 00:32:03,760
Gorgeous are you serious...

722
00:32:02,560 --> 00:32:04,450
This was not good.

723
00:32:02,930 --> 00:32:05,120
THIIIIIIIS...

724
00:32:05,120 --> 00:32:08,880
Here is Madagascar! Oh you're right...

725
00:32:10,560 --> 00:32:14,000
Even the first one was difficult...

726
00:32:12,230 --> 00:32:14,340
OI GORGEOUS!

727
00:32:13,290 --> 00:32:16,800
Their make up matches

728
00:32:14,340 --> 00:32:15,840
WHAT'S THIS!?

729
00:32:15,840 --> 00:32:17,450
MADAGASCAR!

730
00:32:17,450 --> 00:32:19,580
Why the hell don't you know. Find it on the first try your idiot!

731
00:32:19,580 --> 00:32:22,430
GET IT RIGHT!

732
00:32:21,360 --> 00:32:24,560
Her voice is loud...

733
00:32:22,640 --> 00:32:24,920
You look at it a lot don't ya?

734
00:32:24,010 --> 00:32:24,870
yes...

735
00:32:24,920 --> 00:32:26,590
Apologise to Madagascar!

736
00:32:26,730 --> 00:32:30,180
Sorry...Saipan! THIIIIIIS....

737
00:32:32,100 --> 00:32:34,030
Let him do his thing

738
00:32:33,020 --> 00:32:36,780
And the third challenger is...

739
00:32:34,790 --> 00:32:37,530
This is bad!

740
00:32:37,680 --> 00:32:40,620
Mao's collar quiz with Hattori Yukio (historian).

741
00:32:40,620 --> 00:32:42,690
...but not this time...

742
00:32:42,690 --> 00:32:46,180
HEYYYYYYY!!

743
00:32:43,850 --> 00:32:46,550
Huh?

744
00:32:49,940 --> 00:32:51,820
Where is Hattori sensei?

745
00:32:52,050 --> 00:32:55,240
Aja Kong please take a seat.

746
00:32:54,760 --> 00:32:57,330
Aa, that's what it means!

747
00:32:56,020 --> 00:32:59,400
She got lured...

748
00:32:58,700 --> 00:33:00,700
So that's how it is?...

749
00:33:00,700 --> 00:33:04,200
AJA KONG!!!!

750
00:33:05,120 --> 00:33:07,800
When you think of Aja you think of a tin drum

751
00:33:07,800 --> 00:33:10,970
When you think of a tin drum you think of Aja

752
00:33:10,970 --> 00:33:16,100
I naturally know about it- the ittokan(Tin drum) quiz!

753
00:33:13,360 --> 00:33:19,020
There's no way she knows anything about it

754
00:33:17,820 --> 00:33:19,990
How long have you wrestled with the ittokan?

755
00:33:19,990 --> 00:33:23,260
Around 25-26 years.

756
00:33:23,260 --> 00:33:24,510
All this time together.

757
00:33:24,510 --> 00:33:28,880
To you the ittokan is a very valuable signature item right?

758
00:33:27,870 --> 00:33:30,290
It's kinda like me and the shishimai...

759
00:33:28,880 --> 00:33:32,750
Yeah of course it's something more than a signature item.

760
00:33:32,750 --> 00:33:35,440
It's my best partner.

761
00:33:35,180 --> 00:33:37,360
Her feelings for the ittokan are like me and the shishimai...

762
00:33:35,440 --> 00:33:37,190
Let's move on

763
00:33:37,190 --> 00:33:41,960
What is the official name of the ittokan?

764
00:33:42,780 --> 00:33:51,240
A: 16-litre drum

765
00:33:45,990 --> 00:33:51,240
B: 18-litre drum, C:20-litre drum

766
00:33:47,310 --> 00:33:49,750
So that's what it means

767
00:33:51,840 --> 00:33:53,130
Kong-san please.

768
00:33:52,600 --> 00:33:53,130
B

769
00:33:53,130 --> 00:33:54,400
18-litre drum.

770
00:33:54,400 --> 00:33:56,400
Because itto (volume unit)...

771
00:33:56,400 --> 00:33:58,650
is 18 litres right?

772
00:33:58,970 --> 00:34:00,830
That is correct!

773
00:33:59,540 --> 00:34:00,830
See?

774
00:34:02,200 --> 00:34:05,770
I at least know the meaning of itto!!

775
00:34:05,770 --> 00:34:07,390
Here is the next question:

776
00:34:07,390 --> 00:34:11,860
Among the uses of the ittokan, which is the most common?

777
00:34:12,730 --> 00:34:20,600
A: paint

778
00:34:14,770 --> 00:34:20,600
B: food oil

779
00:34:15,910 --> 00:34:18,720
This must be it!

780
00:34:17,150 --> 00:34:20,600
C: soy sauce

781
00:34:18,830 --> 00:34:21,930
I thought it was soy...

782
00:34:20,210 --> 00:34:22,200
Isn't it B?

783
00:34:20,600 --> 00:34:24,050
But there are so many uses...

784
00:34:22,490 --> 00:34:25,730
Is it okay to put soy sauce in it?

785
00:34:24,050 --> 00:34:27,210
Well to me soy sauce is the most useful.

786
00:34:26,990 --> 00:34:29,610
Interesting...

787
00:34:28,400 --> 00:34:31,520
If it's oil it will be sticky inside.

788
00:34:30,370 --> 00:34:32,950
It wasn't oil..

789
00:34:31,520 --> 00:34:34,420
and for the juniors it will be difficult to remove.

790
00:34:34,290 --> 00:34:36,610
She's really thinking about this.

791
00:34:34,420 --> 00:34:35,630
Kongsan?

792
00:34:35,630 --> 00:34:38,400
This is probably A: paint.

793
00:34:38,400 --> 00:34:40,320
In the old days it might have been soy sauce,

794
00:34:40,320 --> 00:34:44,250
but lately it's not very common, before I would go to soba restaurants to get soy drums,, however

795
00:34:44,250 --> 00:34:46,660
lately soba restaurants are not using soy drums.

796
00:34:46,660 --> 00:34:48,880
So the supply is very limited.

797
00:34:48,880 --> 00:34:51,080
Unfortunately...

798
00:34:51,080 --> 00:34:56,140
The correct answer is B: food oil

799
00:34:54,480 --> 00:34:56,140
Oil huh...

800
00:34:56,140 --> 00:34:59,240
But oil is not going away even if you wash it!

801
00:34:59,240 --> 00:35:02,080
You can't use the oil ones

802
00:34:59,700 --> 00:35:02,730
It's not a question whether it's easy to clean..

803
00:35:02,080 --> 00:35:06,040
You have no clue about the ittokan do you?!

804
00:35:06,830 --> 00:35:11,150
Who do ya think you're talking to?!

805
00:35:11,560 --> 00:35:15,640
I don't want to be lectured about the drum by someone who has never used it!!

806
00:35:15,640 --> 00:35:20,660
And so, even though she has no perfect knowledge of the drum,

807
00:35:20,660 --> 00:35:24,400
Aja's feelings towards it were certainly communicated.

808
00:35:24,700 --> 00:35:26,370
Everyone failed didn't they?

809
00:35:26,370 --> 00:35:30,110
Well Nagano got three questions right.

810
00:35:30,110 --> 00:35:34,240
However we could also have answered the first and second questions...

811
00:35:34,240 --> 00:35:37,400
Lately, you've consistently been bad man..

812
00:35:37,400 --> 00:35:39,650
It's true, if you think about it.

813
00:35:40,150 --> 00:35:41,920
Since you came out it's like...

814
00:35:41,920 --> 00:35:46,790
You don't even confirm your theories and still go "thanks for the hard work"...

815
00:35:46,790 --> 00:35:49,400
Huh, am I being scolded right now?

816
00:35:49,400 --> 00:35:50,430
Will you keep appearing?

817
00:35:50,840 --> 00:35:53,920
How about you take the night bus?

818
00:35:55,900 --> 00:35:59,970
Huh, after 24 years in the industry, will I start taking the night bus?

819
00:36:00,700 --> 00:36:02,720
Do you take the green car (first class train wagon)?

820
00:36:02,720 --> 00:36:05,280
Well I have had the opportunity to be in a green car...

821
00:36:07,380 --> 00:36:09,500
Well this appearance is not worth the green car...

822
00:36:09,910 --> 00:36:12,420
You can take "kodama" (plain wagon)

823
00:36:13,450 --> 00:36:15,300
Still better than the bus!

824
00:36:15,490 --> 00:36:16,650
Much better than bus anyway.

825
00:36:16,650 --> 00:36:19,640
I am Tamura Kenji, the person doing that is Moriwaki Kenji(comedian).

826
00:36:19,640 --> 00:36:21,990
There you go trash talking about others too...

827
00:36:22,980 --> 00:36:27,240
NO NO It's true! Moriwaki Kenji

828
00:36:27,240 --> 00:36:32,260
gets on the green car but pays the ticket back and gets on the kodama!

829
00:36:32,260 --> 00:36:33,940
I really am telling the truth!

830
00:36:36,690 --> 00:36:39,780
Here comes the next presenter, welcome!!

831
00:36:46,710 --> 00:36:50,520
It's Tanaka from the Ungirls!

832
00:36:50,520 --> 00:36:52,950
Pleased to meet you!!

833
00:36:52,950 --> 00:36:58,370
Well...this time I thought I will present a theory...

834
00:36:58,370 --> 00:36:59,990
The theory this time...

835
00:36:59,990 --> 00:37:02,110
...seriously what is it?

836
00:37:02,110 --> 00:37:03,720
Why are you looking at me all the time!?

837
00:37:03,720 --> 00:37:07,100
I thought of you as a mate!

838
00:37:07,100 --> 00:37:08,970
As a mate right?

839
00:37:07,950 --> 00:37:08,970
He is one right?

840
00:37:08,970 --> 00:37:12,270
Feels like you guys are plants that live in the same tank!

841
00:37:12,270 --> 00:37:16,800
I am doing this for a long time so cut me some slack!

842
00:37:16,800 --> 00:37:20,040
Actually, you sort of feel like the same food as well...

843
00:37:20,040 --> 00:37:22,280
About the theory, in old times

844
00:37:22,280 --> 00:37:26,020
there was a game called "Moero! professional baseball", do you remember?

845
00:37:26,020 --> 00:37:27,160
Nintendo?

846
00:37:26,210 --> 00:37:27,160
You remember it?

847
00:37:27,160 --> 00:37:30,400
When you talk about this game, what comes up is

848
00:37:30,400 --> 00:37:34,850
that the foreign players' strength settings are so high

849
00:37:34,850 --> 00:37:40,810
that even if they bunt, it ends up being a homerun.

850
00:37:40,810 --> 00:37:42,960
If you hit the ball nicely...

851
00:37:41,660 --> 00:37:42,950
Yes, that's correct.

852
00:37:42,950 --> 00:37:46,050
So this time I brought this:

853
00:37:46,050 --> 00:37:51,920
The theory that if you bunt a ball with a speed of 300 km/h you will still get a home run!

854
00:37:52,770 --> 00:37:55,820
What do you think about this?

855
00:37:54,390 --> 00:37:55,820
Shouldn't be possible!

856
00:37:55,820 --> 00:37:56,810
Not possible!

857
00:37:56,810 --> 00:37:58,360
It won't be able to increase height.

858
00:37:58,360 --> 00:38:01,550
It will just go straight and will not reach the seats...

859
00:38:01,550 --> 00:38:03,810
It will not achieve an arched course...

860
00:38:03,810 --> 00:38:06,890
But this is OK, because

861
00:38:06,890 --> 00:38:10,930
you think that if you don't swing upwards you won't get a homerun

862
00:38:10,930 --> 00:38:14,510
but truth is if you hit it horizontally,

863
00:38:14,510 --> 00:38:17,230
if the hit is good it will go flying.

864
00:38:16,090 --> 00:38:17,230
I see.

865
00:38:17,230 --> 00:38:19,720
Because if it's just..

866
00:38:19,720 --> 00:38:24,820
If you hit right above the center the angle can be certainly confirmed.

867
00:38:25,240 --> 00:38:28,370
What a creepy way of explaining!

868
00:38:28,650 --> 00:38:31,560
This is unfair!!

869
00:38:29,950 --> 00:38:31,560
It's OK we understood you.

870
00:38:31,560 --> 00:38:34,460
If you say so then it becomes so!

871
00:38:35,280 --> 00:38:41,930
If a ball comes from a pitching machine at 300 km/h, then a homerun will be achieved even with a bunt.

872
00:38:42,520 --> 00:38:46,260
The legendary 1980's Nintendo game

873
00:38:43,250 --> 00:38:46,630
I don't quite know about this...

874
00:38:44,840 --> 00:38:47,870
I wasn't even born then.

875
00:38:46,260 --> 00:38:48,680
"Moero! professional baseball"

876
00:38:46,630 --> 00:38:50,310
You're not born yet

877
00:38:48,680 --> 00:38:51,320
the bunt homerun.

878
00:38:55,120 --> 00:38:57,540
This was a bunt just now!

879
00:38:57,540 --> 00:39:00,780
It went over 130 metres!

880
00:38:59,090 --> 00:39:01,840
This was a success just now.

881
00:39:00,310 --> 00:39:03,320
The games in the 80's man...

882
00:39:01,990 --> 00:39:05,570
And so, making this bunt homerun a reality

883
00:39:05,570 --> 00:39:09,520
is this machine with a pitching speed of 300 km/h.

884
00:39:12,640 --> 00:39:15,920
That's scary!!

885
00:39:14,850 --> 00:39:18,290
I get goosebumps

886
00:39:15,260 --> 00:39:22,690
Previously, the challenge taken by ex-professional baseball player Yamasaki Takeshi...

887
00:39:16,840 --> 00:39:19,570
Right right, he appeared before.

888
00:39:18,300 --> 00:39:21,840
Last time was not successful but...

889
00:39:25,650 --> 00:39:28,140
This is very scary!

890
00:39:26,290 --> 00:39:29,360
You can't even see the ball...

891
00:39:28,790 --> 00:39:31,290
That's how you'd end up

892
00:39:33,440 --> 00:39:36,240
There's nothing but laugh.

893
00:39:35,330 --> 00:39:38,980
I didn't see it. It went BAM!

894
00:39:38,980 --> 00:39:40,560
and with all the smoke...

895
00:39:40,560 --> 00:39:42,690
As seen,

896
00:39:42,690 --> 00:39:46,090
If this is the pitching speed,

897
00:39:42,810 --> 00:39:46,800
Isn't it amazing, scary!

898
00:39:46,090 --> 00:39:50,200
there is no chance of a bunt home run.

899
00:39:49,420 --> 00:39:52,100
This is a nice theory

900
00:39:50,880 --> 00:39:54,570
In order to back this experiment scientifically,

901
00:39:54,570 --> 00:40:00,840
we asked the science fiction investigator Yanagita Rikao.

902
00:39:58,010 --> 00:40:00,240
That's an amazing name.

903
00:39:59,030 --> 00:40:00,850
Fiction...

904
00:40:00,780 --> 00:40:05,230
The question is whether it's possible to achieve a bunt homerun.

905
00:40:05,230 --> 00:40:09,900
Given that the bat is securely fixed,

906
00:40:09,900 --> 00:40:14,270
the ball could fly 122 metres according to the calculation.

907
00:40:14,270 --> 00:40:19,210
When the bat is fixed, then the balls speed after impact

908
00:40:19,210 --> 00:40:23,370
equals the ball's initial speed times the ball's elasticity coefficient.

909
00:40:23,370 --> 00:40:27,040
In this case the ball's resistance is approximately 0.42.

910
00:40:27,040 --> 00:40:31,770
So 300 times 0.42 equals 126 km as the ball's speed after impact.

911
00:40:32,840 --> 00:40:37,390
If the ball has a speed of 126 km, then it

912
00:40:37,390 --> 00:40:42,940
can result in a 122 metre homerun.

913
00:40:43,630 --> 00:40:46,570
And on the day of the experiment,

914
00:40:46,570 --> 00:40:50,430
Just like Rikao sensei suggested,

915
00:40:50,430 --> 00:40:54,090
A metal base was fixated on the batter's box.

916
00:40:53,960 --> 00:40:56,280
I hope this works.

917
00:40:55,120 --> 00:40:59,130
And this time, prepared exclusively for the show,

918
00:40:59,130 --> 00:41:03,960
is this 300km/h pitching machine.

919
00:41:04,800 --> 00:41:09,070
Rikao sensei is also on the scene.

920
00:41:09,070 --> 00:41:12,650
And with that, the preparations are completed.

921
00:41:12,650 --> 00:41:15,440
Will it be possible to achieve a bunt homerun

922
00:41:15,440 --> 00:41:19,100
with this 300km /h pitching machine?

923
00:41:20,110 --> 00:41:22,880
Why that face!?

924
00:41:21,580 --> 00:41:22,880
It's a good face.

925
00:41:23,370 --> 00:41:26,700
Will it be possible to achieve a bunt homerun

926
00:41:26,700 --> 00:41:30,670
with this 300km /h pitching machine?

927
00:41:30,940 --> 00:41:34,410
First of, a wooden bat was fixed.

928
00:41:34,410 --> 00:41:37,260
And a memorable first try!

929
00:41:37,370 --> 00:41:38,640
Ready!

930
00:41:47,580 --> 00:41:50,140
What came off? Ah, the arm...

931
00:41:51,260 --> 00:41:53,440
It came off on the first try...

932
00:41:51,900 --> 00:41:55,440
Something seems to have gotten in...

933
00:41:55,100 --> 00:41:56,410
Not even close...

934
00:41:56,410 --> 00:41:58,410
That's a dead ball right?

935
00:41:58,800 --> 00:42:02,350
The ball was pitched

936
00:42:00,910 --> 00:42:02,760
That was it!

937
00:42:02,350 --> 00:42:07,210
Going straight towards Hamada's armpit, it just ripped the arm off.

938
00:42:07,210 --> 00:42:11,870
At the sight of this, the expectations of a homerun are rising.

939
00:42:12,640 --> 00:42:17,070
The ball's speed during this pitch was 304 km/h.

940
00:42:17,480 --> 00:42:21,310
After adjusting the ball's course, the experiment continues.

941
00:42:21,610 --> 00:42:22,960
Ready!

942
00:42:26,830 --> 00:42:28,430
On the second try?

943
00:42:35,980 --> 00:42:41,850
Gaining a great height, the ball passes the net.

944
00:42:41,890 --> 00:42:44,220
If this is the case...

945
00:42:44,260 --> 00:42:48,560
Maybe it is possible after all.

946
00:42:48,560 --> 00:42:52,350
We need another 5 millimetres.

947
00:42:50,640 --> 00:42:52,350
5 millimetres yeah?

948
00:42:53,160 --> 00:42:56,520
However, the next pitch...

949
00:42:56,520 --> 00:42:57,850
Ready!

950
00:43:02,560 --> 00:43:04,190
It broke!

951
00:43:05,930 --> 00:43:08,220
It came off..

952
00:43:07,020 --> 00:43:08,220
It broke!

953
00:43:09,980 --> 00:43:12,110
It's like the wig came off...

954
00:43:14,700 --> 00:43:17,590
It broke off!

955
00:43:15,590 --> 00:43:17,590
It did...

956
00:43:17,980 --> 00:43:21,550
Not tolerating the ball's massive speed,

957
00:43:21,550 --> 00:43:24,300
the bat just broke.

958
00:43:24,430 --> 00:43:27,530
It's an uncommon way of breaking.

959
00:43:26,030 --> 00:43:27,530
That's right.

960
00:43:27,530 --> 00:43:31,400
Normally it grazes through

961
00:43:31,400 --> 00:43:33,740
and cuts the wood.

962
00:43:33,740 --> 00:43:36,080
But this just snapped off.

963
00:43:36,080 --> 00:43:38,540
It got ripped instead.

964
00:43:40,030 --> 00:43:45,020
The bat may have snapped, but the bunt was successful.

965
00:43:45,770 --> 00:43:50,400
And so this time a metal bat was prepared.

966
00:43:50,400 --> 00:43:52,620
and the experiment resumed.

967
00:43:53,040 --> 00:43:58,280
With an unbreakable metal bat, a bunt homerun should be possible.

968
00:43:59,150 --> 00:44:00,440
Ready!

969
00:44:13,120 --> 00:44:15,920
It hit a good spot

970
00:44:15,920 --> 00:44:19,250
Where is the ball?

971
00:44:26,430 --> 00:44:29,860
It reached second base...

972
00:44:30,200 --> 00:44:33,850
In case Rikao sensei miss calculated...

973
00:44:33,850 --> 00:44:36,440
we examined the pitch using slow motion.

974
00:44:39,100 --> 00:44:42,440
It bent so much!

975
00:44:40,400 --> 00:44:42,440
It does yeah.

976
00:44:43,580 --> 00:44:48,670
The bat just warps like rubber under the ball's high speed,

977
00:44:48,670 --> 00:44:52,110
and it just absorbed its force.

978
00:44:52,780 --> 00:44:58,300
With the unexpected turn of events, Rikao sensei checks his calculations...

979
00:44:55,420 --> 00:44:56,800
Quit him already...

980
00:44:56,800 --> 00:44:58,590
He looks very cool.

981
00:44:58,300 --> 00:45:01,870
In order to make the impossible possible,

982
00:45:01,870 --> 00:45:07,120
his answer is...

983
00:45:05,070 --> 00:45:07,820
The answer is!

984
00:45:07,820 --> 00:45:10,670
If we use tennis balls

985
00:45:11,280 --> 00:45:14,140
Use tennis balls!

986
00:45:12,250 --> 00:45:15,040
It started getting weird this theory!

987
00:45:14,890 --> 00:45:19,980
Will a bunt homerun be accomplished with tennis balls?

988
00:45:38,360 --> 00:45:43,630
In order to achieve homerun, the answer that Rikao sensei gave is...

989
00:45:43,630 --> 00:45:45,840
Tennis balls.

990
00:45:46,510 --> 00:45:49,680
You considered the tennis ball's heaviness?

991
00:45:48,640 --> 00:45:49,680
Yes that's right.

992
00:45:49,680 --> 00:45:53,450
Compared to a baseball, the tennis ball has a greater elasticity coefficient,

993
00:45:53,450 --> 00:45:54,850
so that will make the ball fly easier.

994
00:45:55,080 --> 00:45:57,760
So you think it's possible?

995
00:45:56,720 --> 00:45:57,760
I think it's possible.

996
00:45:58,670 --> 00:46:04,190
Moreover, to achieve bunt homerun, the pitching machine was moved closer to the batter,

997
00:46:04,190 --> 00:46:08,620
and the tennis balls' proneness to slow down was covered.

998
00:46:09,200 --> 00:46:14,030
According to calculations, this will achieve a pitching distance 3 times higher.

999
00:46:14,030 --> 00:46:18,920
At last, will that result in the bunt homerun we have been dreaming?

1000
00:46:19,800 --> 00:46:23,070
The time of the fateful result is here!

1001
00:46:23,130 --> 00:46:25,000
Ready!

1002
00:46:24,990 --> 00:46:26,190
Ready!

1003
00:46:35,390 --> 00:46:39,070
A pitch that was completely covered on camera

1004
00:46:39,070 --> 00:46:44,090
Has science accomplished a bunt homerun?

1005
00:46:45,340 --> 00:46:47,150
Ready!

1006
00:46:51,610 --> 00:46:53,450
Hmm...

1007
00:46:52,030 --> 00:46:53,690
It's not flying at all

1008
00:46:53,580 --> 00:46:55,870
A second base...

1009
00:46:56,680 --> 00:47:01,800
And to conclude, a bunt homerun is only a game thing.

1010
00:47:02,000 --> 00:47:04,190
TANAKA!!

1011
00:47:02,760 --> 00:47:04,190
I apologise!

1012
00:47:04,650 --> 00:47:06,860
What the hell?

1013
00:47:05,450 --> 00:47:06,840
It concluded so suddenly..

1014
00:47:07,130 --> 00:47:08,510
What is this?

1015
00:47:08,590 --> 00:47:10,460
Emm what is this?

1016
00:47:10,460 --> 00:47:14,080
I am very sorry, everything i said before was gibberish...

1017
00:47:14,090 --> 00:47:17,600
This V (sounds B in Japanese), didn't even result in a band...

1018
00:47:17,600 --> 00:47:19,840
I don't like this...

1019
00:47:19,840 --> 00:47:22,080
But you can't help this!!!

1020
00:47:22,080 --> 00:47:24,200
That doll was mistreated as well...

1021
00:47:24,200 --> 00:47:27,520
I really felt bad for my partner.

1022
00:47:28,270 --> 00:47:30,060
Next week

1023
00:47:28,420 --> 00:47:54,850
Check out our Facebook and Website for more Wednesday Downtown! This video was subbed by a community run project called the Wednesday Downtown project. Thanks for watching!

1024

1025
00:47:30,480 --> 00:47:34,040
The theory that the funny skits in pretty girls' phone are not funny at all,

1026
00:47:34,280 --> 00:47:37,230
The name of this ingredient is that we find in fukujinzuke (pickles),

1027
00:47:37,230 --> 00:47:39,800
is not known by anyone.

1028
00:47:39,800 --> 00:47:44,510
Also, is you reverse a prank multiple times, you end up losing confidence.

1029
00:47:45,850 --> 00:47:50,990
And finally, we investigate the theory of the worst speaker in pro-wrestling, Maeda Akira.
