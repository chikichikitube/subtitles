00:00:02,450 --> 00:00:04,720
Saionji

2
00:00:06,950 --> 00:00:09,890
Dear father and mother,
Thank you for everything.
I am going to be happy
with Takayuki-san.
Ayaka

3
00:00:09,960 --> 00:00:14,990
One year ago

4
00:00:27,610 --> 00:00:30,040
2012 Health Diagnosis

5
00:00:30,040 --> 00:00:32,410
2012 Health Diagnosis Report
Name: Saionji Tadashi
Age: 64

6
00:00:32,410 --> 00:00:37,350
Good

7
00:00:51,710 --> 00:00:55,600
Ayaka's due date for the baby
is the 20th of next month.

8
00:00:53,530 --> 00:00:55,600
Ayaka's childbirth
due date

9
00:00:55,600 --> 00:00:58,180
What kind of present should we give her?

10
00:00:55,730 --> 00:01:00,910
Present

11
00:00:58,180 --> 00:01:00,810
Money would be better
than material objects, I think—

12
00:01:00,810 --> 00:01:02,040
Anything's fine.

13
00:01:03,220 --> 00:01:05,760
Don't ask me silly questions.

14
00:01:06,250 --> 00:01:08,350
Let's give them money, then.

15
00:01:08,350 --> 00:01:10,140
Cash, huh?

16
00:01:15,340 --> 00:01:17,220
Does that displease you?

17
00:01:17,220 --> 00:01:19,870
There are times I don't want to eat fish.

18
00:01:19,870 --> 00:01:21,960
Shouldn't you know me by now?

19
00:01:23,180 --> 00:01:25,820
I'll fix you something else, then.

20
00:01:25,820 --> 00:01:27,700
Would you like meat of some kind—

21
00:01:26,870 --> 00:01:28,250
Forget it. How's the bath?

22
00:01:28,250 --> 00:01:29,410
It is ready.

23
00:01:29,410 --> 00:01:31,100
Your robe is ready, too.

24
00:01:31,100 --> 00:01:32,520
Please take it when you please.

25
00:01:32,520 --> 00:01:35,470
I come home from work, and
there's nothing decent to eat.

26
00:01:35,470 --> 00:01:36,610
I am sorry.

27
00:01:37,320 --> 00:01:40,440
You're not bowing low enough.
It's meaningless!

28
00:02:24,690 --> 00:02:27,260
Investigation Report

29
00:02:27,930 --> 00:02:29,560
Urai Asako, 22 years old.

30
00:02:29,560 --> 00:02:32,740
She's a student in your husband's
Japanese literature class.

31
00:02:31,460 --> 00:02:32,730
Saionji Tadashi (65)

32
00:02:33,140 --> 00:02:34,630
His student?

33
00:02:34,630 --> 00:02:37,860
I will thoroughly investigate
their behavior.

34
00:02:34,700 --> 00:02:38,100
Freelance investigator:
Umemoto Kurumi

35
00:02:38,650 --> 00:02:40,210
Congratulations.

36
00:02:40,210 --> 00:02:43,210
You finally have a basis for divorce.

37
00:02:43,210 --> 00:02:44,800
Hey, hey...

38
00:02:44,800 --> 00:02:46,930
An illicit affair between a university
professor and his student?

39
00:02:46,930 --> 00:02:48,450
Isn't this a little too scandalous?

40
00:02:48,450 --> 00:02:49,930
We scored.

41
00:02:49,930 --> 00:02:53,350
We couldn't ask for a better way
to corner the husband for infidelity.

42
00:02:52,620 --> 00:02:55,990
Office landlord:
Toyama Yoshie

43
00:02:53,350 --> 00:02:55,950
We'll make a bundle in
compensation, a bundle in fees,

44
00:02:55,950 --> 00:02:57,620
and you can pay your rent!

45
00:02:57,980 --> 00:03:01,890
Please excuse them. I know you've
just learned of your husband's affair.

46
00:02:58,520 --> 00:03:01,790
Hakamada's assistant:
Nonomura Kanae

47
00:03:01,890 --> 00:03:03,360
I don't mind.

48
00:03:03,360 --> 00:03:06,530
After all, Fumiko-san's
been hoping for this.

49
00:03:06,530 --> 00:03:08,470
Hoping for it?

50
00:03:09,550 --> 00:03:11,530
Sensei, is the tea ready?

51
00:03:10,040 --> 00:03:13,440
Temp:
Shinozuka Rina

52
00:03:11,530 --> 00:03:14,330
Please hurry. Our client is waiting.

53
00:03:14,330 --> 00:03:15,420
I'm sorry.

54
00:03:14,440 --> 00:03:17,840
Attorney:
Hakamada Yukio

55
00:03:15,420 --> 00:03:17,370
I made you some tea.

56
00:03:17,370 --> 00:03:20,250
The turtle bread will be done soon, too.

57
00:03:20,250 --> 00:03:22,540
I could barf from the name alone.

58
00:03:22,540 --> 00:03:24,580
What's the idea behind it? Aggravation?

59
00:03:24,580 --> 00:03:30,060
Healthy turtle bread is the first in my
winter nutrition fortification series.

60
00:03:30,650 --> 00:03:32,590
It will invigorate

61
00:03:32,590 --> 00:03:33,950
Fumiko-san for tasks that lie ahead,

62
00:03:33,950 --> 00:03:35,500
and it's also delicious.

63
00:03:35,500 --> 00:03:38,130
Sensei, forget about the
bread for now. This way.

64
00:03:38,130 --> 00:03:39,160
Come on.

65
00:03:39,160 --> 00:03:43,390
Hakamada-sensei, thank you
for all you've done for me.

66
00:03:40,630 --> 00:03:45,200
Current episode's client:
Saionji Fumiko

67
00:03:43,720 --> 00:03:47,140
I can finally divorce my husband.

68
00:03:47,140 --> 00:03:48,410
No, no.

69
00:03:48,410 --> 00:03:50,220
We can't let our guard down just yet.

70
00:03:50,860 --> 00:03:53,490
All we've done is identify
the illicit partner.

71
00:03:53,490 --> 00:03:59,460
These photos aren't proof
they're having physical relations.

72
00:03:59,930 --> 00:04:03,120
Please bear with us for a while,

73
00:04:03,120 --> 00:04:05,020
until we have gathered solid evidence.

74
00:04:07,460 --> 00:04:09,760
We've been married for 34 years.

75
00:04:10,240 --> 00:04:13,030
I've endured and endured...

76
00:04:13,770 --> 00:04:20,060
But, ever since my daughter got
married and left home a year ago...

77
00:04:21,040 --> 00:04:25,010
Thanks to your help, I've been
able to prepare myself for this.

78
00:04:25,010 --> 00:04:26,080
A year?

79
00:04:26,080 --> 00:04:29,190
You've been making
preparations for a whole year?

80
00:04:29,190 --> 00:04:31,840
I have been following Sensei's
and everyone else's instructions.

81
00:04:31,840 --> 00:04:33,940
Oh, right!

82
00:04:33,940 --> 00:04:40,090
This was the first time I've ever
watched a foreign drama.

83
00:04:40,090 --> 00:04:44,700
It was a greatly helpful
resource for my research.

84
00:04:44,700 --> 00:04:49,200
"Iron Spy Woman Marilyn"
season 3, "Invasive Investigation."

85
00:04:44,700 --> 00:04:49,200
Invasive Investigation
Iron Spy Woman Marilyn

86
00:04:49,200 --> 00:04:52,020
It's a unique and
bodacious action series.

87
00:04:52,020 --> 00:04:54,990
Amidst psychological
warfare, we see Marilyn's

88
00:04:54,990 --> 00:04:58,140
feminine sorrows oozing
out for the first time.

89
00:04:58,140 --> 00:05:01,580
It's the most mature season so far.

90
00:05:01,580 --> 00:05:04,440
I'm a spy first and a woman second.

91
00:05:06,340 --> 00:05:10,330
I'll feign love if necessary,
to gather information.

92
00:05:16,810 --> 00:05:18,260
I want some, too!

93
00:05:18,260 --> 00:05:19,290
Let me see it.

94
00:05:19,290 --> 00:05:22,500
Those are my eyedrops.
Don't use them for stupid games.

95
00:05:22,500 --> 00:05:25,140
By the way, how are flower
arrangement classes going?

96
00:05:25,980 --> 00:05:27,570
I'm making a living with it.

97
00:05:27,570 --> 00:05:29,170
I have a room at the Culture
School near the station,

98
00:05:29,170 --> 00:05:35,210
I have more students now,
and have saved up a lot.

99
00:05:35,210 --> 00:05:36,680
Beautiful.

100
00:05:36,680 --> 00:05:38,280
1,240,000...

101
00:05:38,280 --> 00:05:41,190
Did you save all that in a year?

102
00:05:42,520 --> 00:05:46,180
My daughter is having
her baby next month...

103
00:05:46,660 --> 00:05:50,130
and I don't have anything
to worry about any more.

104
00:05:50,520 --> 00:05:54,970
I am finally confident
enough to live on my own.

105
00:05:57,480 --> 00:06:01,680
I saw my husband's health
diagnosis report after

106
00:05:59,670 --> 00:06:04,240
One year ago

107
00:06:02,460 --> 00:06:08,680
my daughter's wedding,
the night I came home.

108
00:06:08,980 --> 00:06:10,880
2012 Health Diagnosis Report. Name: Saionji Tadashi. Age: 64

109
00:06:08,980 --> 00:06:12,920
The projected life-span was 89 years.

110
00:06:10,880 --> 00:06:12,920
Projected life span: 89 years.

111
00:06:12,920 --> 00:06:15,790
My husband will be 64 this year.

112
00:06:16,890 --> 00:06:22,600
That means that after my daughter
has gotten married and left home...

113
00:06:22,600 --> 00:06:27,070
I would have to live alone with that
boorish man for another 25 years.

114
00:06:27,070 --> 00:06:28,270
The very thought of it...

115
00:06:35,140 --> 00:06:37,160
Hey, where's my food?

116
00:06:37,160 --> 00:06:38,330
Ah, I'll prepare it—

117
00:06:39,210 --> 00:06:42,480
Fumiko's husband:
Saionji Tadashi

118
00:06:40,090 --> 00:06:41,780
I'd better not catch your cold!

119
00:06:45,320 --> 00:06:47,120
I have reached my limit.

120
00:06:47,120 --> 00:06:50,090
I cannot bear it any longer.

121
00:06:51,600 --> 00:06:53,010
Please relax.

122
00:06:55,400 --> 00:06:57,570
What's essential when
divorcing at an older age,

123
00:06:57,570 --> 00:07:00,870
is to have the funds necessary to
plan your life after the divorce.

124
00:07:01,790 --> 00:07:05,600
Because you are a housewife, I advise being patient
with the divorce until you enough for living expenses

125
00:07:05,600 --> 00:07:07,800
until you have sufficient
savings for living expenses.

126
00:07:08,330 --> 00:07:10,480
Savings for living expenses...

127
00:07:10,480 --> 00:07:15,920
In general, there are three ways for an elderly
wife to obtain money in a divorce.

128
00:07:12,140 --> 00:07:27,760
Money obtainable in senior citizen divorce

129
00:07:16,780 --> 00:07:27,760
Property distribution

130
00:07:16,810 --> 00:07:21,370
Property distribution, split
pension, and compensation.

131
00:07:18,420 --> 00:07:27,760
Split pension

132
00:07:20,190 --> 00:07:27,760
Compensation

133
00:07:22,400 --> 00:07:27,760
In my rush to leave him,
I had not thought that far...

134
00:07:27,770 --> 00:07:30,940
Firstly, concerning
property distribution...

135
00:07:28,990 --> 00:07:37,970
Property distribution

136
00:07:31,480 --> 00:07:35,180
Even if your financial properties
are in your husband's name,

137
00:07:31,560 --> 00:07:37,970
The wife is entitled to half the estate.

138
00:07:35,180 --> 00:07:37,970
as the wife, you are entitled to half.

139
00:07:38,320 --> 00:07:41,060
Research his savings,
insurance, and so on,

140
00:07:39,910 --> 00:07:42,680
Kanto Central Golf Club

Life Insurance
Certificate

141
00:07:41,060 --> 00:07:42,680
and make a list of them.

142
00:07:42,680 --> 00:07:45,210
Even if he's been hiding them,

143
00:07:45,210 --> 00:07:47,480
U&F Bank

144
00:07:45,210 --> 00:07:48,320
financial institutions
send statements regularly.

145
00:07:49,350 --> 00:07:50,850
Regarding split pension,

146
00:07:50,320 --> 00:08:00,060
Split pension

147
00:07:50,850 --> 00:07:53,550
if your husband agrees, or if the
court decides in your favor,

148
00:07:53,090 --> 00:08:00,060
It is possible to receive at most 1/2 of welfare pension

149
00:07:53,550 --> 00:07:58,090
it's possible for you to receive,
at most, half of the annuity,

150
00:07:53,550 --> 00:08:00,060
Pension Ledger

151
00:07:58,090 --> 00:08:00,060
as of April 2007.

152
00:08:00,060 --> 00:08:03,430
You can inquire about his pension
at the social security bureau.

153
00:08:03,970 --> 00:08:04,890
Yes.

154
00:08:04,890 --> 00:08:06,530
Regarding compensation...

155
00:08:05,600 --> 00:08:24,350
Compensation

156
00:08:06,530 --> 00:08:08,880
it is contingent on whether
your husband has been

157
00:08:08,880 --> 00:08:11,210
engaging in illicit activities,
which would be reason for divorce.

158
00:08:09,240 --> 00:08:24,350
It can be collected if there have been illicit activities

159
00:08:11,640 --> 00:08:13,450
"Illicit activities"?

160
00:08:13,450 --> 00:08:17,110
Has there been any domestic
violence? Or adultery?

161
00:08:14,510 --> 00:08:24,350
Domestic violence, adultery (affairs)

162
00:08:20,540 --> 00:08:24,350
I have been dismayed by my husband's
constant infidelity for many years.

163
00:08:24,350 --> 00:08:25,700
Let's take that route, then!

164
00:08:26,520 --> 00:08:29,640
While researching your husband's finances
and pension to prepare for the divorce,

165
00:08:29,640 --> 00:08:32,220
we'll wait for your husband to show signs of cheating.

166
00:08:33,260 --> 00:08:34,990
I understand.

167
00:08:34,990 --> 00:08:35,960
Lastly,

168
00:08:36,220 --> 00:08:39,800
please secure three months worth
of living expenses for after the divorce.

169
00:08:41,400 --> 00:08:43,000
Let's say you were to
find a room to rent.

170
00:08:43,000 --> 00:08:46,900
Living expenses would be at
least 170,000 yen per month.

171
00:08:47,290 --> 00:08:50,430
Plus, you'd need to make a deposit, and
pay a finder's fee to the Realtor.

172
00:08:51,010 --> 00:08:52,520
Right, so...

173
00:08:52,520 --> 00:08:55,850
To be on the safe side, save
up about one million yen.

174
00:08:56,110 --> 00:08:57,680
One million?!

175
00:08:59,020 --> 00:09:02,090
But, my husband is in
charge of all our finances...

176
00:09:03,060 --> 00:09:06,630
Is it possible for you to
work and earn the money?

177
00:09:08,400 --> 00:09:10,540
I have gotten on in age...

178
00:09:11,100 --> 00:09:13,180
I have no work experience either...

179
00:09:14,030 --> 00:09:16,840
Do you have a hobby of some kind?

180
00:09:17,180 --> 00:09:18,930
A hobby?

181
00:09:19,460 --> 00:09:20,970
It could be anything.

182
00:09:23,740 --> 00:09:27,440
Well, I am a certified
flower arrangement instructor.

183
00:09:27,440 --> 00:09:29,880
That's it. That's a good one.

184
00:09:32,030 --> 00:09:34,930
You've been steadily
preparing ever since...

185
00:09:35,480 --> 00:09:39,290
You can take your first step
toward self-sufficiency, at last.

186
00:09:40,970 --> 00:09:44,140
Hakamada-sensei, and everyone else,

187
00:09:44,140 --> 00:09:46,230
I cannot thank you all enough.

188
00:09:46,930 --> 00:09:48,480
I must reiterate, however,

189
00:09:48,970 --> 00:09:52,740
that these photos are not enough
to demand compensation.

190
00:09:52,740 --> 00:09:55,790
They are not sufficient
evidence of illicit activity.

191
00:09:56,130 --> 00:09:59,000
As to the invasive investigation,
our performance is about to begin.

192
00:09:59,000 --> 00:10:01,240
And if you would, please continue

193
00:10:01,240 --> 00:10:03,850
with the investigation
of your husband's activities.

194
00:10:05,980 --> 00:10:07,800
We're now at a critical stage.

195
00:10:08,780 --> 00:10:10,190
I hope you're ready.

196
00:10:10,750 --> 00:10:14,190
I have been ready for a long time now.

197
00:10:15,860 --> 00:10:18,270
This is the final stage
before compensation.

198
00:10:18,270 --> 00:10:20,070
Proceed with caution.

Enandai Culture School
2:00PM
Flower Arrangement Class
Saionji-sensei

203
00:10:44,590 --> 00:10:48,960
What if you inserted the yellow orchid here?

204
00:10:49,620 --> 00:10:51,390
And one more.

205
00:10:51,820 --> 00:10:54,110
How lovely!

206
00:10:54,110 --> 00:10:56,120
Thank you very much!

207
00:10:56,120 --> 00:11:01,080
I'm so honored to be taught by
the wife of professor Saionji.

208
00:11:01,080 --> 00:11:03,740
It is an honor, isn't it?

209
00:11:03,740 --> 00:11:08,050
Saionji

210
00:11:10,730 --> 00:11:14,020
What were you doing out so late?

211
00:11:14,020 --> 00:11:15,390
I am sorry.

212
00:11:15,390 --> 00:11:18,490
I wish you had told me
you would be home early.

213
00:11:18,490 --> 00:11:20,740
It's all because of that
flower arrangement class.

214
00:11:20,740 --> 00:11:24,680
That's why you weren't home
to greet your husband.

215
00:11:24,680 --> 00:11:27,200
Throw this crap away!

216
00:11:27,200 --> 00:11:29,050
What are you doing?!

217
00:11:29,050 --> 00:11:31,770
The flower arrangement class means so much to me...

218
00:11:30,800 --> 00:11:33,100
Who cares about your flower arrangement class?

219
00:11:33,100 --> 00:11:34,270
It's just a hobby, isn't it?

220
00:11:34,270 --> 00:11:36,140
As of today, you're quitting!

221
00:11:37,770 --> 00:11:39,760
I said, you're quitting!

222
00:11:39,760 --> 00:11:41,880
Please, stop!

223
00:11:41,880 --> 00:11:45,040
My students count on me!

224
00:11:46,090 --> 00:11:46,750
What?

225
00:11:47,370 --> 00:11:48,290
What?

226
00:11:49,650 --> 00:11:51,190
Yeah, sure.

227
00:11:51,190 --> 00:11:52,890
Cut the cheap trick.

228
00:11:52,890 --> 00:11:55,830
You can't even keep house properly.

229
00:11:55,830 --> 00:11:58,090
Flower arrangement class, my ass!

230
00:11:59,480 --> 00:12:01,330
I am truly sorry.

231
00:12:01,330 --> 00:12:04,040
I will return early from now on.

232
00:12:04,040 --> 00:12:06,670
So please, please let me
continue the flower arrangement class...

233
00:12:06,670 --> 00:12:10,930
Please let me continue
the flower arrangement class!

234
00:12:11,700 --> 00:12:14,280
Who feeds you, huh?

235
00:12:14,280 --> 00:12:15,580
I said you're quitting, and you'll obey!

236
00:12:19,440 --> 00:12:21,490
What's with that look?

237
00:12:27,720 --> 00:12:30,300
What's with that look?

238
00:12:38,900 --> 00:12:40,850
Now, draw me a bath.

239
00:12:40,850 --> 00:12:42,590
Then, make dinner.

240
00:12:42,590 --> 00:12:43,440
Understood?

241
00:12:48,730 --> 00:12:50,350
Get on with it!

242
00:12:57,500 --> 00:12:58,690
Where do you think you're going?

243
00:13:02,220 --> 00:13:06,080
I told you to proceed with caution.

244
00:13:06,080 --> 00:13:09,380
I understand how you
must feel, Fumiko-san.

245
00:13:09,840 --> 00:13:11,720
You have bear with
it one last time.

246
00:13:11,720 --> 00:13:12,540
You have to go back.

247
00:13:14,100 --> 00:13:15,380
Hey, Sensei.

248
00:13:15,380 --> 00:13:18,090
Your "invigoration bread"
isn't cutting it this time.

249
00:13:20,570 --> 00:13:21,900
Fumiko-san.

250
00:13:21,900 --> 00:13:24,810
We must establish a solid
premise for divorce.

251
00:13:25,140 --> 00:13:28,560
We will have solid evidence of your
husband's illicit activities soon,

252
00:13:29,480 --> 00:13:31,220
so you have to persevere
just a little longer.

253
00:13:43,820 --> 00:13:47,060
I know it's painful,
but please, return home.

254
00:13:47,060 --> 00:13:49,510
I'll go with you. Okay?

255
00:13:54,750 --> 00:13:56,110
Fumiko-san!

256
00:13:56,110 --> 00:13:57,170
Are you all right?

257
00:13:56,670 --> 00:13:57,530
Fumiko-san!

258
00:13:57,530 --> 00:13:58,340
Are you all right?

259
00:13:58,340 --> 00:13:59,640
Are you all right?

260
00:13:59,640 --> 00:14:01,400
I can't do it...

261
00:14:02,000 --> 00:14:05,780
I don't even want to breathe
the same air as my husband.

262
00:14:05,780 --> 00:14:07,370
Fumiko-san...

263
00:14:07,870 --> 00:14:09,080
I...

264
00:14:09,490 --> 00:14:12,730
I... If I stay with him...

265
00:14:13,900 --> 00:14:17,330
I may kill him...

266
00:14:21,090 --> 00:14:22,580
You mustn't.

267
00:14:22,580 --> 00:14:26,500
If you kill him, you
won't get compensated.

268
00:14:29,080 --> 00:14:30,450
Sensei...

269
00:14:38,010 --> 00:14:42,290
Now that Fumiko-san has left her home...

270
00:14:45,970 --> 00:14:49,980
I have to use the moral harassment card.

271
00:14:47,370 --> 00:14:51,700
Moral harassment

272
00:14:47,370 --> 00:14:51,700
Moral harassment -> psychological violence

273
00:14:49,980 --> 00:14:52,080
With it I'll bill for the divorce,

274
00:14:52,080 --> 00:14:54,320
bill for matrimonial expenses
in case of separation,

275
00:14:54,320 --> 00:14:55,740
and set the stage for
the longer-term battle.

276
00:14:55,740 --> 00:14:57,180
What are "matrimonial expenses"?

277
00:14:57,180 --> 00:15:03,920
Matrimonial expenses

278
00:14:58,410 --> 00:15:03,920
The husband can be billed
for living expenses during a separation

279
00:14:58,430 --> 00:15:02,350
The husband can be billed
for living expenses during a separation.

280
00:15:03,920 --> 00:15:07,720
However, so that he
doesn't get suspicious,

281
00:15:07,720 --> 00:15:11,920
I'll keep that under wraps
until we have evidence of his adultery.

282
00:15:12,680 --> 00:15:16,600
You're buying time while
Kurumi-chan gathers evidence.

283
00:15:16,600 --> 00:15:19,570
But, what if we don't get solid evidence?

284
00:15:20,430 --> 00:15:24,930
Based on the current situation,
it would be difficult to get compensation.

285
00:15:25,840 --> 00:15:28,570
I hope Fumiko-san can go on with this.

286
00:15:28,570 --> 00:15:34,250
The year-long preparation period is also
a barometer of the client's commitment.

287
00:15:34,700 --> 00:15:36,970
I believe she will pave
her own path from here on.

288
00:15:36,970 --> 00:15:39,390
No matter what happens.

289
00:15:39,390 --> 00:15:40,670
Fumiko-san can do it.

290
00:15:42,150 --> 00:15:45,000
No way. Really?

291
00:15:45,000 --> 00:15:46,680
I'm so happy.

292
00:15:47,230 --> 00:15:49,960
Excuse me. I'd like
another one of these.

293
00:15:49,960 --> 00:15:51,490
Right away.

294
00:16:08,750 --> 00:16:10,080
Hold on.

295
00:16:13,730 --> 00:16:15,210
How do you do?

296
00:16:15,210 --> 00:16:17,460
I'm an attorney from the
Hakamada Law Office.

297
00:16:17,460 --> 00:16:19,130
My name is Hakamada.

298
00:16:19,900 --> 00:16:23,600
I represent your wife,
who is requesting a divorce.

299
00:16:24,050 --> 00:16:26,680
Requesting a divorce?

300
00:16:28,260 --> 00:16:30,250
Divorce.

301
00:16:30,250 --> 00:16:32,890
She must be momentarily confused.

302
00:16:32,890 --> 00:16:37,610
Your wife can no longer endure
your moral harassment,

303
00:16:37,610 --> 00:16:39,380
and desires a divorce.

304
00:16:41,170 --> 00:16:42,840
There's a misunderstanding.

305
00:16:42,840 --> 00:16:47,740
She was doing that flower arrangement class
and neglecting her household duties.

306
00:16:47,740 --> 00:16:52,430
So I cautioned her a little, that's all.

307
00:16:52,430 --> 00:16:53,860
Poor thing.

308
00:16:54,460 --> 00:16:58,700
That woman can't do a thing on her own.

309
00:16:58,700 --> 00:17:00,050
Just leave her be.

310
00:17:00,050 --> 00:17:02,330
She'll come crawling back to me.

311
00:17:02,330 --> 00:17:03,640
I wonder about that.

312
00:17:05,070 --> 00:17:07,010
According to Fumiko-san's research,

313
00:17:07,010 --> 00:17:13,770
the net worth of the Saionji household
is 60,252,063 yen,

314
00:17:14,210 --> 00:17:16,380
Saionji Tadashi Financial Property List
Net worth: 60,252,063 yen

315
00:17:16,750 --> 00:17:18,380
What is this?

316
00:17:18,380 --> 00:17:20,400
She can't do anything on her own?

317
00:17:20,810 --> 00:17:24,380
I'd say her research was quite splendid.

318
00:17:25,660 --> 00:17:27,310
Don't be absurd!

319
00:17:27,310 --> 00:17:30,400
I worked for this money.
This is my money!

320
00:17:30,400 --> 00:17:32,830
It might be in your name,

321
00:17:32,830 --> 00:17:36,970
but financial properties acquired
during matrimony belong to the couple.

322
00:17:37,380 --> 00:17:39,930
In the case of divorce,
your wife is entitled to half.

323
00:17:39,930 --> 00:17:43,240
That is, approximately 30 million yen.

324
00:17:43,240 --> 00:17:45,040
30 million?

325
00:17:46,530 --> 00:17:48,280
When did she do this?

326
00:17:49,170 --> 00:17:50,420
Where is she?

327
00:17:51,040 --> 00:17:53,300
We are keeping her safe at our office.

328
00:17:53,300 --> 00:17:55,010
I won't agree to it!

329
00:17:55,010 --> 00:17:56,680
She's the one who walked out on me!

330
00:17:56,680 --> 00:17:58,490
I won't give her a single yen!

331
00:17:58,490 --> 00:18:01,990
And I won't consent to a divorce!

332
00:18:02,900 --> 00:18:04,580
Don't.

333
00:18:04,080 --> 00:18:05,000
This is a load of crap!

334
00:18:05,000 --> 00:18:06,300
Go right ahead.

335
00:18:06,300 --> 00:18:07,720
We've saved the data.

336
00:18:07,720 --> 00:18:10,200
Rip it up to your heart's content.

337
00:18:12,190 --> 00:18:13,390
Get out!

338
00:18:13,390 --> 00:18:15,300
Get out now!

339
00:18:16,720 --> 00:18:17,970
I see.

340
00:18:18,540 --> 00:18:20,540
It's just as Fumiko-san said.

341
00:18:21,240 --> 00:18:26,240
You have trouble
controlling your emotions.

342
00:18:26,970 --> 00:18:30,680
You and I will have a discussion later,

343
00:18:30,680 --> 00:18:33,340
concerning compensation for
moral harassment of your wife,

344
00:18:33,340 --> 00:18:36,960
and matrimonial expenses while
she lives separately from you.

345
00:18:37,710 --> 00:18:39,270
Please look forward to it.

346
00:18:49,980 --> 00:18:52,180
Hakamada Law Office

347
00:18:50,720 --> 00:18:52,180
Now, everyone.

348
00:18:52,180 --> 00:18:54,840
Nutrition fortification series, part two!

349
00:18:54,840 --> 00:18:57,880
I have just finished baking
red adder Korean ginseng bread.

350
00:18:57,880 --> 00:18:59,020
Let's have lunch.

351
00:18:59,840 --> 00:19:01,180
Go ahead.

352
00:19:01,180 --> 00:19:02,040
After you.

353
00:19:01,180 --> 00:19:02,040
Go ahead.

354
00:19:02,040 --> 00:19:03,730
No, you go ahead!

355
00:19:02,640 --> 00:19:04,300
No need to hesitate.

356
00:19:06,030 --> 00:19:08,920
How very kind of you.
I will try one.

357
00:19:08,920 --> 00:19:11,860
Well... I don't think you should...

358
00:19:10,530 --> 00:19:12,460
Please. It's fresh from the oven.

359
00:19:13,020 --> 00:19:14,840
Thank you.

360
00:19:17,170 --> 00:19:18,470
Dear.

361
00:19:19,070 --> 00:19:20,690
Is that the moral-harassment husband?

362
00:19:23,220 --> 00:19:24,740
Hey, what do you want?

363
00:19:24,740 --> 00:19:25,560
Out of my way.

364
00:19:25,560 --> 00:19:26,700
Hey. You're going home.

365
00:19:26,700 --> 00:19:28,670
No. I will not go back.

366
00:19:28,670 --> 00:19:30,130
Never mind. You're coming back.

367
00:19:29,140 --> 00:19:30,520
Hey you!

368
00:19:29,600 --> 00:19:31,140
Please stop!

369
00:19:32,090 --> 00:19:34,170
Boy, you're stupid.

370
00:19:34,170 --> 00:19:36,900
Don't you know they're conning you?

371
00:19:36,900 --> 00:19:37,810
Let's go.

372
00:19:38,450 --> 00:19:40,130
Please stop it.

373
00:19:42,510 --> 00:19:44,330
I may be overstepping out bounds,

374
00:19:45,690 --> 00:19:51,240
but I don't tolerate
harassment in my office.

375
00:19:51,240 --> 00:19:53,040
Sensei.

376
00:19:56,740 --> 00:19:59,340
What's all this about harassment?

377
00:19:59,340 --> 00:20:00,450
Bastard.

378
00:20:00,450 --> 00:20:01,810
My name is Hakamada!

379
00:20:01,810 --> 00:20:02,940
No, you're a bastard.

380
00:20:02,940 --> 00:20:05,360
You're the culprit who tricked Fumiko.

381
00:20:05,900 --> 00:20:07,880
If you don't let go,

382
00:20:07,880 --> 00:20:12,430
domestic violence will be added
to your compensation fee.

383
00:20:12,430 --> 00:20:14,280
Are you okay with that?

384
00:20:17,560 --> 00:20:20,250
Hakamada Law Office, my ass!

385
00:20:20,250 --> 00:20:21,970
You're nothing but a third-rate lawyer.

386
00:20:22,690 --> 00:20:24,360
I have representation by
a first-rate law firm,

387
00:20:24,360 --> 00:20:26,440
which has served my
family for generations.

388
00:20:26,440 --> 00:20:28,010
You're in for a treat!

389
00:20:33,560 --> 00:20:34,570
Yes.

390
00:20:35,180 --> 00:20:40,450
I'm in for a treat, all right.

391
00:20:41,690 --> 00:20:46,360
Saionji-san states he has no recollection
of instances of moral harassment.

392
00:20:41,720 --> 00:20:43,760
Wilson-Nakatani Corporate Law Offices
Attorney at Law: Nakatani Takuya

393
00:20:46,360 --> 00:20:49,980
Regardless of the fact that
her husband is faultless,

394
00:20:49,980 --> 00:20:54,600
the wife has requested
divorce of her own accord.

395
00:20:54,600 --> 00:20:58,300
Saionji's legal adviser:
Nakatani Takuya

396
00:20:54,600 --> 00:20:58,300
This being the case, the wife will be
liable for compensating her husband.

397
00:20:58,300 --> 00:21:03,080
It will be deducted when their assets
are divided on occasion of a divorce.

398
00:21:03,560 --> 00:21:06,050
Is he intending to take it to court?

399
00:21:06,050 --> 00:21:09,810
The wife started a new business,
then neglected her family life,

400
00:21:09,810 --> 00:21:13,050
thereby leaving her husband
in the lurch, all to himself.

401
00:21:13,050 --> 00:21:15,290
He is emphatic on this point.

402
00:21:15,290 --> 00:21:20,630
Concretely explain what
you mean by "neglected."

403
00:21:20,630 --> 00:21:22,760
Preparing meals,

404
00:21:23,070 --> 00:21:24,480
cleaning...

405
00:21:24,480 --> 00:21:26,740
General household duties.

406
00:21:27,100 --> 00:21:30,290
It's typical in cases such as this.

407
00:21:37,110 --> 00:21:38,290
These journals contain

408
00:21:38,290 --> 00:21:41,340
One year's worth of entries since
Fumiko-san started her flower arrangement class.

409
00:21:41,340 --> 00:21:45,500
For one whole year she has logged
with dates, morning and evening,

410
00:21:45,500 --> 00:21:47,620
the two meals per day she prepared,

411
00:21:47,620 --> 00:21:49,360
the upkeep of their home, doing laundry,

412
00:21:49,360 --> 00:21:51,220
and so on, accompanied
with photographs.

413
00:21:51,710 --> 00:21:52,860
If I may say so,

414
00:21:55,260 --> 00:21:57,500
Fumiko-san is a very meticulous person.

415
00:21:57,500 --> 00:22:02,490
And coincidentally, the journals
provide fodder for her case.

416
00:22:02,000 --> 00:22:03,670
2013 February 3 (Sunday).
A month has passed since I began teaching flower arrangement class...

417
00:22:03,670 --> 00:22:05,640
My husband said, "Mussel soup again? Did you forget you served it yesterday? Are you dumber than an elementary schooler?"

418
00:22:05,640 --> 00:22:07,670
Daikon salad, he left two bites untouched.

419
00:22:21,300 --> 00:22:22,940
The exit is that way.

420
00:22:24,520 --> 00:22:27,560
Saionji

421
00:22:25,900 --> 00:22:31,540
Your wife's journals are sufficient
evidence for the court

422
00:22:31,540 --> 00:22:34,780
that she was not neglectful
of her household duties.

423
00:22:34,780 --> 00:22:36,480
So what?

424
00:22:36,930 --> 00:22:39,380
That lawyer Hakamada...

425
00:22:39,380 --> 00:22:43,880
He looks like a goof,
but he's quite wily.

426
00:22:43,880 --> 00:22:46,860
Though they appear
to be your wife's journals,

427
00:22:46,860 --> 00:22:52,820
he probably advised her a year
ago to keep a detailed record.

428
00:22:53,340 --> 00:22:56,400
Gauging the fact that she has even
listed all your financial assets,

429
00:22:56,400 --> 00:22:59,640
we must assume our opponent has
even more thorough preparations.

430
00:22:59,920 --> 00:23:01,850
My home, my property.

431
00:23:02,340 --> 00:23:04,660
She's going to take half of everything?

432
00:23:04,660 --> 00:23:06,730
As for that, please don't worry.

433
00:23:07,030 --> 00:23:15,380
Estate inherited from previous generations → exempt from property distribution

434
00:23:07,030 --> 00:23:15,380
Separate property

435
00:23:07,120 --> 00:23:08,700
We will claim it as separate property,

436
00:23:08,700 --> 00:23:11,140
in which case it will be exempt
from property distribution.

437
00:23:11,140 --> 00:23:13,130
Everything you have inherited from your family

438
00:23:13,130 --> 00:23:15,410
is exempt from property distribution.

439
00:23:15,970 --> 00:23:17,880
Anyway, do something.

440
00:23:17,880 --> 00:23:19,710
You're a legal advisor, aren't you?

441
00:23:20,000 --> 00:23:22,280
And don't let her take
a single yen of my money.

442
00:23:22,280 --> 00:23:23,420
Saionji-san.

443
00:23:24,400 --> 00:23:27,560
If as you say you don't
want her to take a yen,

444
00:23:27,560 --> 00:23:31,890
we would need your wife to withdraw
her request for divorce.

445
00:23:31,890 --> 00:23:33,680
What am I supposed to do about it?

446
00:23:33,940 --> 00:23:36,760
Firstly, sincerely apologize to her.

447
00:23:37,310 --> 00:23:41,590
Then you apologize, apologize,
and keep apologizing.

448
00:23:41,590 --> 00:23:46,030
I've been feeding that
worthless woman for 34 years.

449
00:23:46,030 --> 00:23:47,770
Why do I have to apologize?

450
00:23:47,770 --> 00:23:50,480
Do you want her to make off
with your fortune?

451
00:23:51,650 --> 00:23:53,840
It's cheaper to apologize.

452
00:23:54,200 --> 00:23:56,760
However, if you decide to apologize,

453
00:23:56,760 --> 00:23:59,540
be as sincere as you can,
keep your emotions under control,

454
00:23:59,540 --> 00:24:01,060
and keep apologizing.

455
00:24:07,190 --> 00:24:09,580
I don't want to see Saionji ever again.

456
00:24:09,980 --> 00:24:15,560
His lawyer says your husband
is deeply repentant,

457
00:24:15,560 --> 00:24:18,700
and wants to beg your forgiveness
from the bottom of his heart.

458
00:24:18,700 --> 00:24:20,280
Beg my forgiveness?

459
00:24:20,720 --> 00:24:23,210
I know what that Saionji is up to.

460
00:24:23,650 --> 00:24:25,770
I don't want to see
his face ever again!

461
00:24:26,410 --> 00:24:29,790
I know you can't bear to breathe
the same air as him.

462
00:24:29,790 --> 00:24:31,900
I know how that feels.

463
00:24:31,900 --> 00:24:33,790
I was like that, too.

464
00:24:34,320 --> 00:24:36,690
Let's meet with your husband.

465
00:24:36,690 --> 00:24:37,860
Huh?

466
00:24:41,930 --> 00:24:44,070
Hakamada
Law Office

467
00:24:52,840 --> 00:24:54,590
I'm sorry.

468
00:24:55,230 --> 00:25:00,510
I didn't know you were so unhappy.

469
00:25:01,700 --> 00:25:07,230
This is the first time you
have ever apologized to me.

470
00:25:08,520 --> 00:25:11,860
I make no excuses. Truly.

471
00:25:13,160 --> 00:25:14,660
"I am sorry."

472
00:25:15,210 --> 00:25:16,530
"I make no excuses."

473
00:25:18,780 --> 00:25:21,570
I want you to show me
your genuine feelings.

474
00:25:21,570 --> 00:25:23,110
Genuine feelings?

475
00:25:23,110 --> 00:25:24,370
How dare you talk to me that way!

476
00:25:24,370 --> 00:25:25,390
Saionji-san.

477
00:25:29,810 --> 00:25:32,740
I am sorry. I mean it!

478
00:25:41,880 --> 00:25:45,290
You're not bowing low enough.
It's meaningless!

479
00:25:48,460 --> 00:25:50,110
What's the matter?

480
00:25:50,860 --> 00:25:54,400
Is that not what you always say to me?

481
00:25:54,400 --> 00:25:57,360
You're not bowing low enough.
It's meaningless!

482
00:25:57,750 --> 00:25:58,820
You...

483
00:25:58,820 --> 00:26:04,520
Do you have any idea
of why I was unhappy?

484
00:26:05,410 --> 00:26:07,480
Isn't that what you came
to apologize about?

485
00:26:07,940 --> 00:26:12,020
Tell me. Why was I unhappy?

486
00:26:12,020 --> 00:26:15,540
Well, you know...

487
00:26:17,100 --> 00:26:19,970
You don't even know why
you're apologizing.

488
00:26:19,970 --> 00:26:21,220
You're a riot.

489
00:26:21,950 --> 00:26:23,080
What's so funny?

490
00:26:23,080 --> 00:26:25,380
How dare you take advantage of my—

491
00:26:25,380 --> 00:26:27,130
So, you wanted to apologize.

492
00:26:27,550 --> 00:26:30,070
I knew it was just a ploy!

493
00:26:32,440 --> 00:26:34,270
You trapped me, didn't you?

494
00:26:34,270 --> 00:26:37,880
I fed you for 34 years, and
this is the thanks I get?

495
00:26:37,880 --> 00:26:38,960
That's right.

496
00:26:38,960 --> 00:26:43,040
For 34 years as a housewife,

497
00:26:43,040 --> 00:26:46,570
until Ayaka grew up, I had no
choice but to live with you.

498
00:26:47,360 --> 00:26:49,090
With a person like you!

499
00:26:49,090 --> 00:26:53,000
"A person like you"? How dare you!

500
00:26:53,000 --> 00:26:54,260
Saionji-san.

501
00:26:54,820 --> 00:26:57,460
Fumiko-san has lived with you,

502
00:26:57,460 --> 00:27:00,590
and knows what kind of person
you are, through and through.

503
00:27:01,380 --> 00:27:04,680
On the other hand, for 34 years,

504
00:27:05,340 --> 00:27:09,540
you have known nothing about Fumiko-san.

505
00:27:11,970 --> 00:27:13,780
And now you have to face reality.

506
00:27:15,400 --> 00:27:19,710
What you can do now,
is to learn of Fumiko-san's pain,

507
00:27:20,480 --> 00:27:22,560
and express your genuine feelings.

508
00:27:25,660 --> 00:27:26,630
Ha!

509
00:27:27,220 --> 00:27:30,650
Wake up, you dumb woman!

510
00:27:30,930 --> 00:27:35,420
Don't you realize this
lawyer is tricking you?

511
00:27:35,420 --> 00:27:36,800
Saionji-san, please calm down!

512
00:27:36,940 --> 00:27:39,700
You don't know how the world works!

513
00:27:39,700 --> 00:27:42,330
You'll never make it alone!

514
00:27:42,330 --> 00:27:44,640
You're going to regret this!

515
00:27:50,110 --> 00:27:54,050
Your wife is firmly
resolved to divorce you.

516
00:27:54,050 --> 00:27:56,510
To protect your assets,
we will take it to court.

517
00:27:56,510 --> 00:28:01,430
But before we do, it would be most
judicious to refer to arbitration.

518
00:28:01,430 --> 00:28:03,310
You're saying I should get the divorce?

519
00:28:03,310 --> 00:28:06,700
By referring to arbitration
before taking it to court,

520
00:28:06,700 --> 00:28:10,170
we can minimize the compensation.

521
00:28:10,170 --> 00:28:13,230
I will outline the arbitration proposal.

522
00:28:13,600 --> 00:28:17,950
Before the opposing attorney
garners any evidence,

523
00:28:17,950 --> 00:28:20,290
I advise you to make
your decision immediately.

524
00:28:20,290 --> 00:28:21,230
Goodbye.

525
00:28:27,230 --> 00:28:29,760
Divorcing at old age...

526
00:28:28,890 --> 00:28:30,920
Divorce?! You think you can
make it on your own?!

527
00:28:28,890 --> 00:28:30,920
You're coming home!!

528
00:28:29,760 --> 00:28:32,270
A woman's grudge is a scary thing.

529
00:28:32,270 --> 00:28:38,660
The crux of the story is that the husband
is clueless that his wife loathes him.

530
00:28:39,030 --> 00:28:42,290
Makes you wonder what
marriage is all about.

531
00:28:42,630 --> 00:28:46,710
It's your job to find out, Kanae-sensei.

532
00:28:46,710 --> 00:28:48,020
"Sensei"?

533
00:28:48,020 --> 00:28:50,790
Oh stop it. "Sensei."
Jeez, come on.

534
00:28:50,790 --> 00:28:53,560
Your popularity is off
the charts lately.

535
00:28:53,560 --> 00:28:55,670
Please keep up the good work.

536
00:28:56,150 --> 00:28:59,690
Editor at Tokiwa Publishing:
Tabata Misato

537
00:28:56,150 --> 00:29:00,900
I can't wait to find out what
happens to the senior couple.

538
00:29:01,360 --> 00:29:02,480
Me, too.

539
00:29:02,480 --> 00:29:03,690
I wonder what's going to happen.

540
00:29:04,720 --> 00:29:08,090
Cafe waitress:
Mizutani Sara

541
00:29:06,100 --> 00:29:08,160
First there will be thunder...

542
00:29:11,940 --> 00:29:15,810
Then, there will be a rain of blood.

543
00:29:24,640 --> 00:29:28,840
Excuse me. I didn't order tomato juice.

544
00:29:43,680 --> 00:29:45,500
Hello.

545
00:29:45,500 --> 00:29:48,220
You weren't in class today
so I was wondering...

546
00:29:49,080 --> 00:29:50,430
Hello?

547
00:29:57,410 --> 00:29:59,480
Oh, Ayumi-san.

548
00:30:00,080 --> 00:30:03,480
Do you know where everyone is today?

549
00:30:04,210 --> 00:30:05,630
I...

550
00:30:06,980 --> 00:30:09,030
think I'm going to quit.

551
00:30:09,090 --> 00:30:10,100
What?

552
00:30:10,530 --> 00:30:11,820
I'm sorry.

553
00:30:12,110 --> 00:30:14,460
W-Wait, please!

554
00:30:14,800 --> 00:30:17,010
Please! Please tell me why!

555
00:30:17,010 --> 00:30:18,110
I'm in a hurry.

556
00:30:18,110 --> 00:30:22,430
No one came to class.
What's wrong?

557
00:30:22,430 --> 00:30:26,980
If there is something about me
that is amiss, please tell me.

558
00:30:26,980 --> 00:30:29,980
It's not you, Mrs. Saionji.

559
00:30:29,980 --> 00:30:31,990
Then, why?

560
00:30:34,060 --> 00:30:37,320
The students stopped coming
to class, all at once?

561
00:30:38,670 --> 00:30:42,600
Could your husband be
behind this, somehow?

562
00:30:42,600 --> 00:30:43,710
No, that's not it.

563
00:30:43,710 --> 00:30:46,270
It's suspicious that everyone
stopped coming all at once, though!

564
00:30:46,270 --> 00:30:51,630
No, one of my students told me,
so I know what happened.

565
00:30:52,340 --> 00:31:00,590
Everyone came to class because
I was the wife of professor Saionji.

566
00:31:00,590 --> 00:31:02,070
That's ridiculous.

567
00:31:02,070 --> 00:31:04,080
Just because you're Saionji-san's wife?

568
00:31:04,080 --> 00:31:05,850
What's that got to do with anything?

569
00:31:05,850 --> 00:31:09,870
The Saionji family lineage has
generations of prestigious men.

570
00:31:10,400 --> 00:31:13,510
The students had connections
with them in various ways.

571
00:31:13,510 --> 00:31:17,320
But, when they learned
about the divorce...

572
00:31:17,320 --> 00:31:22,500
In short, the students stopped coming
so as to not offend Saionji-san.

573
00:31:24,880 --> 00:31:27,300
"You don't know how the world works!

574
00:31:27,990 --> 00:31:31,030
You'll never make it alone!"

575
00:31:31,370 --> 00:31:34,740
Maybe my husband was right.

576
00:31:34,740 --> 00:31:36,740
Fumiko-san.

577
00:31:43,950 --> 00:31:48,020
Be that as it may, would you
want to return to your husband?

578
00:31:48,600 --> 00:31:53,860
Can you stand living with him as
you have, for the next 25 years?

579
00:31:54,310 --> 00:31:56,130
I...

580
00:31:58,530 --> 00:31:59,910
can't do it!

581
00:32:00,700 --> 00:32:04,070
In that case, all we
can do is forge ahead.

582
00:32:08,870 --> 00:32:12,820
Your husband's lawyer drafted
an arbitration proposal.

583
00:32:13,320 --> 00:32:16,880
I'm certain he intends to
take it to court after that.

584
00:32:18,720 --> 00:32:21,890
I shouldn't have been so
hasty to leave the house.

585
00:32:23,090 --> 00:32:26,450
If he takes us to court,
my husband will win.

586
00:32:27,230 --> 00:32:28,760
That remains to be seen.

587
00:32:29,550 --> 00:32:31,330
But, before the hearing,

588
00:32:32,820 --> 00:32:34,670
can you fight one more battle?

589
00:32:48,980 --> 00:32:51,870
What have you got up your
sleeve, Hakamada-san?

590
00:32:51,870 --> 00:32:55,920
Why would you suddenly want to have a
meeting with Saionji-san before arbitration?

591
00:32:56,430 --> 00:33:00,740
We have no intention of
canceling arbitration,

592
00:33:00,740 --> 00:33:03,460
unless his wife agrees
to return back home.

593
00:33:03,460 --> 00:33:06,640
I told you she'd come
crawling back to me.

594
00:33:06,640 --> 00:33:08,100
Just look at her.

595
00:33:08,100 --> 00:33:10,360
How's she going to make it on her own?

596
00:33:10,930 --> 00:33:12,270
Saionji-san.

597
00:33:12,270 --> 00:33:17,260
Fumiko-san insists there's something
she must tell you before the hearing.

598
00:33:20,260 --> 00:33:21,430
Fumiko-san.

599
00:33:21,920 --> 00:33:25,860
This is your chance to express
yourself fully to your husband.

600
00:33:26,700 --> 00:33:30,720
Everything you couldn't tell
your husband for 34 years.

601
00:33:38,800 --> 00:33:41,520
Do you remember this place?

602
00:33:42,640 --> 00:33:44,170
This is stupid.

603
00:33:44,170 --> 00:33:52,180
You proposed to me here, 34 years ago.

604
00:33:52,710 --> 00:33:55,060
Don't beat around the bush.

605
00:33:55,320 --> 00:33:56,630
If you want to come back,

606
00:33:56,630 --> 00:33:57,880
be straightforward and say it.

607
00:33:57,880 --> 00:33:59,360
I'll forgive you this time around.

608
00:34:00,190 --> 00:34:01,590
All right. Let's go home.

609
00:34:04,660 --> 00:34:05,630
What are you doing?

610
00:34:07,470 --> 00:34:11,300
I heard Ayaka is having a baby girl.

611
00:34:11,360 --> 00:34:12,370
Huh?

612
00:34:13,130 --> 00:34:15,720
Takayuki-san is beside himself with joy.

613
00:34:15,720 --> 00:34:20,120
He said he's stocking up on all
the baby girl goods he can find.

614
00:34:20,120 --> 00:34:21,740
So what?

615
00:34:21,740 --> 00:34:22,910
I don't have time for this.

616
00:34:22,910 --> 00:34:26,020
Do you remember what you said

617
00:34:26,020 --> 00:34:29,910
to me at the maternity ward,
soon after Ayaka was born?

618
00:34:30,940 --> 00:34:32,290
Maternity ward?

619
00:34:33,330 --> 00:34:36,320
"Damn it. It's a girl."

620
00:34:39,800 --> 00:34:42,400
The fulfillment I had felt after
enduring the pain of delivery,

621
00:34:43,580 --> 00:34:45,890
the joy I felt of becoming a mother...

622
00:34:46,550 --> 00:34:52,040
You crushed them all
with those cold words.

623
00:34:52,040 --> 00:34:55,530
Why are you bringing that up now?
That was years ago.

624
00:34:55,530 --> 00:34:58,410
My parents were desperate
for me to have an heir.

625
00:34:58,410 --> 00:34:59,880
I was scared!

626
00:34:59,880 --> 00:35:02,000
"You married into the Saionji family,

627
00:35:02,820 --> 00:35:05,020
but you can't even produce a boy?!"

628
00:35:06,540 --> 00:35:12,140
You tortured me constantly for
my subsequent infertility,

629
00:35:12,960 --> 00:35:18,100
and escaped from me by
repeatedly having affairs.

630
00:35:19,640 --> 00:35:22,670
If another woman were
to bear you a baby boy,

631
00:35:22,670 --> 00:35:25,340
Fumiko-san had determined
to leave the Saionji family.

632
00:35:25,910 --> 00:35:28,570
That was how desperate she was.

633
00:35:28,570 --> 00:35:29,760
Affairs?

634
00:35:30,700 --> 00:35:32,600
You have no proof.

635
00:35:33,590 --> 00:35:35,820
Why didn't you tell me these things?

636
00:35:35,820 --> 00:35:38,020
How could she?

637
00:35:38,590 --> 00:35:42,350
She knew you had withdrawn from her,

638
00:35:42,350 --> 00:35:45,180
because she couldn't bear you an heir.

639
00:35:47,410 --> 00:35:49,040
Your ill temper,

640
00:35:49,460 --> 00:35:52,420
your ignoring me, verbal abuse,

641
00:35:53,440 --> 00:35:55,370
crude remarks...

642
00:35:56,080 --> 00:35:58,500
Even when I would get sick,

643
00:35:58,500 --> 00:36:01,960
you were only concerned
about your meals.

644
00:36:03,420 --> 00:36:05,950
You did not view me as a woman...

645
00:36:05,950 --> 00:36:09,620
no, you did not view
me as a human being.

646
00:36:23,950 --> 00:36:26,170
You're not young any more.

647
00:36:26,720 --> 00:36:31,660
I thought maybe we'd give our
marriage another chance, but...

648
00:36:34,220 --> 00:36:40,180
It seems there's no choice now
but fight it out in court.

649
00:36:41,570 --> 00:36:44,620
Are you sure you want
to take it to court?

650
00:36:44,620 --> 00:36:45,630
Yes.

651
00:36:46,240 --> 00:36:48,030
I'll tear her apart.

652
00:36:52,790 --> 00:36:53,680
Too bad for you.

653
00:36:53,680 --> 00:36:55,560
Because when it goes to court,

654
00:36:55,560 --> 00:36:59,090
you're the one who will be torn apart.

655
00:37:34,720 --> 00:37:36,360
So what?

656
00:37:36,360 --> 00:37:39,010
This woman was nothing but a diversion!

657
00:37:39,010 --> 00:37:41,060
She seduced me!

658
00:37:42,920 --> 00:37:44,990
Even as a diversion,

659
00:37:45,280 --> 00:37:48,450
illicit affairs are bad news
for a marriage.

660
00:37:49,550 --> 00:37:51,990
Isn't that so, Nakatani-sensei?

661
00:37:52,960 --> 00:37:56,100
Even in the case of illicit affairs,

662
00:37:56,100 --> 00:38:00,320
we won't be charged more than
three million or so in compensation.

663
00:38:00,320 --> 00:38:01,460
Let's go.

664
00:38:04,140 --> 00:38:06,300
I personally don't care, but
this is going to be a scandal.

665
00:38:07,160 --> 00:38:08,730
Having an illicit affair with a student.

666
00:38:11,000 --> 00:38:12,100
Your student?

667
00:38:13,100 --> 00:38:16,990
Sure, maybe you'll get away
with three million in compensation.

668
00:38:17,350 --> 00:38:22,250
However, losing your position
as a university professor.

669
00:38:22,250 --> 00:38:24,470
would be an immeasurable loss,
would it not?

670
00:38:24,740 --> 00:38:30,350
Fumiko-san does not want
to tarnish your reputation.

671
00:38:30,350 --> 00:38:32,720
She just wants you to consent to the divorce.

672
00:38:32,720 --> 00:38:35,160
That's why she asked you here,
to this place full of memories...

673
00:38:38,430 --> 00:38:43,060
Because I know, that if you lost
your university professorship

674
00:38:43,060 --> 00:38:46,170
it would be the end of you.

675
00:38:49,680 --> 00:38:51,120
Saionji-san.

676
00:38:51,120 --> 00:38:52,250
We're done for.

677
00:38:54,760 --> 00:38:56,230
You...

678
00:38:57,630 --> 00:39:02,460
You would go to such
lengths to leave me?

679
00:39:03,890 --> 00:39:05,030
That day...

680
00:39:05,560 --> 00:39:07,460
2012 Health Diagnosis Report

681
00:39:06,820 --> 00:39:10,060
when I saw all the "good" listed
on your health diagnosis report...

682
00:39:10,060 --> 00:39:11,110
I thought to myself,

683
00:39:13,240 --> 00:39:18,710
"How much longer must this man live?

684
00:39:22,580 --> 00:39:25,760
It's true that I am not young any more.

685
00:39:25,760 --> 00:39:28,550
But, I still have many
more years to live.

686
00:39:29,330 --> 00:39:35,090
I don't want to die as Saionji Fumiko."

687
00:40:46,670 --> 00:40:47,810
Fumiko.

688
00:40:58,270 --> 00:40:59,520
Yazawa-sensei.

689
00:40:58,270 --> 00:41:01,940
Enandai Culture School
2:00PM
Flower Arrangement Class
Yazawa Sensei

690
00:40:59,520 --> 00:41:01,780
Yes, how nice!

691
00:41:01,780 --> 00:41:03,160
How do I arrange this part?

692
00:41:03,160 --> 00:41:10,380
You balance it out delicately, like this.

693
00:41:10,380 --> 00:41:12,690
Oh, I see! Thank you very much.

694
00:41:12,690 --> 00:41:14,450
Nice work.

695
00:41:16,200 --> 00:41:20,760
Saionji-san has some shred
of decency, at least.

696
00:41:20,760 --> 00:41:23,380
He notified the flower arrangement students
and had them return to class.

697
00:41:23,380 --> 00:41:25,700
He was raked over the coals.

698
00:41:25,700 --> 00:41:28,970
Even Mr. Moral Harassment
himself did some introspection.

699
00:41:30,510 --> 00:41:34,640
A good divorce is something
that helps people grow.

700
00:41:35,010 --> 00:41:38,270
That's my opinion anyway,
as my client's attorney.

701
00:41:38,710 --> 00:41:42,690
I hope that Fumiko-san and Saionji-san,
now that they've gone separate ways,

702
00:41:42,690 --> 00:41:46,720
will live out their next 25
years in a much better way.

703
00:41:49,840 --> 00:41:52,360
