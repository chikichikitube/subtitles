00:00:00,710 --> 00:00:06,050
OPERATION

2
00:00:07,350 --> 00:00:08,320
Scalpel
- Here

3
00:00:12,960 --> 00:00:14,160
Forceps
- Here

4
00:00:16,760 --> 00:00:17,630
I had enough

5
00:00:18,130 --> 00:00:19,460
Come on, that's enough

6
00:00:19,460 --> 00:00:20,000
But--

7
00:00:21,030 --> 00:00:21,770
Geez

8
00:00:22,070 --> 00:00:23,540
But you can't
- I had enough

9
00:00:23,540 --> 00:00:24,870
It's taking so long!

10
00:00:25,170 --> 00:00:25,600
But--

11
00:00:26,000 --> 00:00:27,110
But it takes time!

12
00:00:27,110 --> 00:00:29,810
I thought it would be
like, 20 or 30 minutes

13
00:00:30,110 --> 00:00:32,710
But this and that and this...
I'm going now!

14
00:00:32,710 --> 00:00:33,450
You can't

15
00:00:33,950 --> 00:00:34,980
No, I'm going

16
00:00:34,980 --> 00:00:35,980
We're not done yet

17
00:00:35,980 --> 00:00:37,120
But I'm fine, really

18
00:00:37,120 --> 00:00:37,820
I'm going now

19
00:00:37,820 --> 00:00:38,620
I can't let you

20
00:00:38,620 --> 00:00:39,080
Huh?

21
00:00:39,380 --> 00:00:40,050
I still have to---

22
00:00:40,050 --> 00:00:40,820
I said I'm ok

23
00:00:41,090 --> 00:00:42,890
Can you bring me a mirror?

24
00:00:44,560 --> 00:00:45,490
Is this..?

25
00:00:45,860 --> 00:00:47,130
Oh, that's my bag

26
00:00:47,430 --> 00:00:48,830
And here's the mirror

27
00:00:52,230 --> 00:00:54,430
Alright, I can go
- No, you can't!

28
00:00:54,430 --> 00:00:55,630
It's ok
- No, it's not!

29
00:00:55,630 --> 00:00:56,470
I told you I can

30
00:00:56,470 --> 00:00:57,240
It's no ok!

31
00:00:57,240 --> 00:00:58,470
But I have a date today

32
00:00:58,470 --> 00:00:59,100
No way

33
00:00:59,100 --> 00:01:01,470
We're going to Disneyland
to ride jet coasters

34
00:01:01,470 --> 00:01:02,470
You can't ride that!

35
00:01:02,470 --> 00:01:04,080
I told you it's ok, I'm going

36
00:01:04,380 --> 00:01:05,080
You should not--

37
00:01:05,080 --> 00:01:08,410
Don't worry I have this mousse,
I'll be decent enough

38
00:01:11,420 --> 00:01:12,520
Please don't do that!!

39
00:01:12,520 --> 00:01:13,750
It's full of germs!

40
00:01:13,750 --> 00:01:15,520
I told you guys it's fine, geez

41
00:01:15,920 --> 00:01:18,190
Also I think I need... a hat, maybe?

42
00:01:18,190 --> 00:01:19,190
Is it sunny outside?

43
00:01:19,190 --> 00:01:20,790
Yes it's clear weather

44
00:01:23,800 --> 00:01:25,100
You shouldn't do that!

45
00:01:26,230 --> 00:01:28,470
Wait a second, maybe this...

46
00:01:29,270 --> 00:01:30,070
Oh, good! I can go

47
00:01:30,070 --> 00:01:32,070
No you can't, of course you can't!

48
00:01:32,070 --> 00:01:33,110
Sorry but I'm good!

49
00:01:33,110 --> 00:01:34,010
Thanks a bunch!

50
00:01:34,010 --> 00:01:36,310
Wait! Where are you going?!
