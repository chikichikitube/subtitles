1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:01,180
Eternal Rivals

2
00:00:01,180 --> 00:00:06,460
Their rivalry began with Moriman humiliating Yamasaki and stealing his underwear

3
00:00:08,160 --> 00:00:13,060
And same thing happened again in the second match

4
00:00:13,740 --> 00:00:18,640
Even by the third match, Yamasaki was not able to taste victory

5
00:00:19,200 --> 00:00:21,760
He got his ass kicked by Moriman in every match

6
00:00:22,120 --> 00:00:25,960
He became looked down by society

7
00:00:26,560 --> 00:00:30,240
Now once again Yamasaki will meet Moriman on the batleground

8
00:00:30,640 --> 00:00:32,880
The sanctioned match begins again

9
00:00:33,240 --> 00:00:37,240
The participants held a pre-match conference

10
00:00:37,580 --> 00:00:41,490
Could you sum up your feelings towards this match?

11
00:00:40,540 --> 00:00:42,540
Ah, let's start with Yamsaki-san

12
00:00:43,360 --> 00:00:48,450
From the dawn of time, the woman takes care of the house, and the husband does the hunting

13
00:00:48,450 --> 00:00:50,920
That's my belief

14
00:00:51,020 --> 00:00:53,320
That's your belief?

15
00:00:53,320 --> 00:00:55,080
The male is strong

16
00:00:55,280 --> 00:00:58,520
That's what I want to spray all over society

17
00:00:57,690 --> 00:01:00,070
Spray?

18
00:01:04,100 --> 00:01:06,440
Since this is your 4th match,

19
00:01:06,440 --> 00:01:10,160
Don't you feel like it's been enough? Isn't Yamasaki a real pain in your ass?

20
00:01:10,160 --> 00:01:12,440
It is a pain

21
00:01:12,440 --> 00:01:16,760
We all know how this ends and I still have to come out here

22
00:01:18,240 --> 00:01:21,760
Wasting my time for this piece of shit is-

23
00:01:20,380 --> 00:01:21,760
Shut up! Be more nervous!

24
00:01:21,760 --> 00:01:22,700
What?!

25
00:01:22,880 --> 00:01:24,680
Be more nervous!

26
00:01:24,680 --> 00:01:27,560
But she's not nervous

27
00:01:27,720 --> 00:01:29,340
Be more nervous!

28
00:01:31,080 --> 00:01:34,580
Since you already know you're gonna lose,

29
00:01:38,940 --> 00:01:42,420
I don't know I'm gonna lose! Victory is a matter of timing!

30
00:01:58,240 --> 00:02:00,940
Finally, time for the match

31
00:02:00,940 --> 00:02:07,980
Within the walls of Korakuen Hall, people gather to watch Yamasaki vs. Moriman's final revenge match

32
00:02:08,720 --> 00:02:12,240
Many bad memories have been built here

33
00:02:12,960 --> 00:02:15,880
So before the match, let's see how they're doing

34
00:02:15,880 --> 00:02:17,660
Lets look into their dressing rooms

35
00:02:19,160 --> 00:02:23,180
Who is in here?  Oh it's Moriman.

36
00:02:23,180 --> 00:02:25,880
Ah, a bento?

37
00:02:26,360 --> 00:02:29,000
She's just having lunch before the match

38
00:02:30,900 --> 00:02:34,040
She's taking it easy, eating lunch, looking at the horoscope

39
00:02:35,220 --> 00:02:36,660
The horoscope!

40
00:02:36,660 --> 00:02:40,980
What a champion, I wonder what her sign is

41
00:02:41,260 --> 00:02:45,440
But more than anything, she's very relaxed

42
00:02:47,580 --> 00:02:49,480
Meanwhile, Yamasaki-san

43
00:02:53,140 --> 00:02:55,760
This is Yamasaki's trainer

44
00:02:57,480 --> 00:03:00,440
Well done, genius comedian!

45
00:03:02,080 --> 00:03:04,140
He has a strong resolve (?)

46
00:03:04,140 --> 00:03:08,320
Well he is preparing

47
00:03:10,020 --> 00:03:11,700
Looking forward to this

48
00:03:11,700 --> 00:03:16,040
Indeed, I'm looking forward to it. The gong will ring any moment.

49
00:03:27,940 --> 00:03:30,360
Everyone, you've been waiting for you

50
00:03:31,800 --> 00:03:34,760
Starting now,

51
00:03:34,760 --> 00:03:39,560
Yamasaki vs. Moriman - Final Revenge Match will begin!

52
00:03:45,340 --> 00:03:49,940
First, the commissioners of this match, the duo DownTown!

53
00:04:27,940 --> 00:04:30,760
Just to see Yamasaki and Moriman,

54
00:04:30,760 --> 00:04:32,560
Why are there so many people here?

55
00:04:34,200 --> 00:04:38,640
That really is a mystery to me as well honestly

56
00:04:38,880 --> 00:04:41,460
There's nothing interesting at all

57
00:04:42,200 --> 00:04:44,460
First off I want to answer something,

58
00:04:44,680 --> 00:04:46,460
These are my everyday clothes

59
00:04:54,380 --> 00:04:57,420
You didn't just go and change into these right?

60
00:04:57,640 --> 00:05:01,080
These used to be my dad's white clothes that I got dyed black

61
00:05:03,280 --> 00:05:04,780
Eh? Dyed?

62
00:05:04,780 --> 00:05:08,580
I thought it could become fashionable this summer

63
00:05:11,160 --> 00:05:12,840
So today,

64
00:05:12,840 --> 00:05:15,940
This TOTALLY is,

65
00:05:14,460 --> 00:05:15,940
This is amazing

66
00:05:15,940 --> 00:05:17,160
The final match

67
00:05:17,160 --> 00:05:19,660
They'll fight till we are satisfied it seems

68
00:05:21,160 --> 00:05:25,220
And I don't know who the audience is rooting for

69
00:05:26,040 --> 00:05:28,520
I have no idea what they're looking forward to

70
00:05:28,520 --> 00:05:31,820
That's what I don't get

71
00:05:29,800 --> 00:05:31,820
Probably fresh blood or something

72
00:05:33,020 --> 00:05:36,780
They might want to see their blood on this floor

73
00:05:36,780 --> 00:05:38,780
Let's call them out shall we?

74
00:05:43,920 --> 00:05:47,580
Everyone, pay attention to that corner;

75
00:05:47,580 --> 00:05:51,130
The Challenger Yamasaki will make his entrance

76
00:06:25,720 --> 00:06:28,100
What was with that entrance?

77
00:06:28,500 --> 00:06:31,140
Actually, honestly, when he came out

78
00:06:31,140 --> 00:06:33,180
I felt kind of inspired

79
00:06:34,300 --> 00:06:37,700
Or rather

80
00:06:35,840 --> 00:06:37,700
I was inspired too

81
00:06:36,820 --> 00:06:37,700
He looked cool

82
00:06:37,700 --> 00:06:40,000
Yeah, I'm here to look impressive today!

83
00:06:40,660 --> 00:06:42,500
You can't show them your lame side

84
00:06:42,500 --> 00:06:44,920
Yeah, there's so many girls here too right?

85
00:06:44,920 --> 00:06:47,620
TODAY, I REFUSE TO SHOW MY GOOD SIDE!

86
00:06:50,380 --> 00:06:53,920
You refuse to show your bad side, right?

87
00:06:52,160 --> 00:06:53,920
I won't show my bad side

88
00:06:53,920 --> 00:06:55,920
"I WON'T SHOW MY GOOD SIDE"

89
00:06:58,320 --> 00:07:00,720
Are you,

90
00:06:58,670 --> 00:07:00,670
nervous?

91
00:07:01,460 --> 00:07:04,940
So now, Yamasaki's closest friends,

92
00:07:04,940 --> 00:07:06,820
Will present flowers to him

93
00:07:08,820 --> 00:07:12,300
First is his best friend from Elementary School,

94
00:07:13,140 --> 00:07:15,140
Nadai Yoshihiro-Sama

95
00:07:24,860 --> 00:07:28,040
His former comedian comrade, Fujita Seiji-sama

96
00:07:41,010 --> 00:07:43,680
You're very happy, aren't you Yamasaki-san?

97
00:07:43,680 --> 00:07:45,820
I'm very very happy!

98
00:07:46,180 --> 00:07:48,460
The audience doesn't know them at all though

99
00:07:49,300 --> 00:07:52,400
Next, the champion Moriman's entrance

100
00:08:33,300 --> 00:08:34,300
COME ON!

101
00:08:34,800 --> 00:08:37,000
THAT'S RIGHT!

102
00:08:40,800 --> 00:08:43,100
You always get your ass kicked first huh?

103
00:08:45,660 --> 00:08:48,280
Next is their introductions

104
00:08:50,080 --> 00:08:53,100
In the red corner, at 210 pounds....

105
00:08:53,100 --> 00:08:56,080
The Invincible Champion, the Assassin Angel

106
00:08:56,080 --> 00:09:00,200
Moriiiiiiiiiiiiiman!

107
00:09:10,040 --> 00:09:18,000
In the blue corner, forever the challenger, The fighter from Nishinomiya

108
00:09:18,000 --> 00:09:23,700
Yamsasakiiii HOOOOSEIIIIIIIII

109
00:09:27,640 --> 00:09:30,660
Before the match everyone,

110
00:09:30,660 --> 00:09:32,660
We have Endo Shozo

111
00:09:37,100 --> 00:09:40,960
Endo Shozo will perform, everyone stand up please

112
00:09:43,880 --> 00:09:46,780
With that, Endo!

113
00:10:27,620 --> 00:10:34,580
Do you know the rhythm of the Samba? HOI HOI HOI

114
00:10:54,560 --> 00:10:54,560
Well...

115
00:10:56,780 --> 00:11:02,540
I'm sure the audience is thinking why they had to stand up for that...

116
00:11:02,000 --> 00:11:02,540
Well well

117
00:11:02,540 --> 00:11:04,540
It was to commemorate this

118
00:11:04,540 --> 00:11:07,080
So now Yamasaki vs Moriman,

119
00:11:07,080 --> 00:11:09,200
Final Revenge Match will be held

120
00:11:09,200 --> 00:11:13,160
What battle shall we start with?

121
00:11:10,480 --> 00:11:13,160
Right, lets have Yamasaki choose first

122
00:11:13,160 --> 00:11:15,680
Let's have him decide

123
00:11:14,780 --> 00:11:16,880
The challenger's choice?

124
00:11:15,680 --> 00:11:16,880
Indeed

125
00:11:16,880 --> 00:11:20,100
So Yamasaki-san, choose the first battle please

126
00:11:20,220 --> 00:11:23,340
There's 18 here

127
00:11:21,200 --> 00:11:23,340
There's 18. Alright I've decided

128
00:11:24,640 --> 00:11:27,220
FRENCH BREAD SMACKING BATTLE

129
00:11:38,580 --> 00:11:40,680
Let's begin!

130
00:11:40,680 --> 00:11:42,600
Round 1...

131
00:11:48,300 --> 00:11:51,300
What kind of advice could this be

132
00:12:34,380 --> 00:12:35,940
Yamasaki-san?

133
00:12:36,340 --> 00:12:37,940
Yamasaki-san?

134
00:12:39,360 --> 00:12:43,200
The french bread... the french bread... hit my crotch

135
00:12:44,200 --> 00:12:46,200
"The french bread hit my crotch"

136
00:12:47,080 --> 00:12:49,340
Well whatever

137
00:12:53,500 --> 00:12:55,500
You just got your ass whooped

138
00:13:01,580 --> 00:13:03,580
All the footage of you was like this

139
00:13:06,300 --> 00:13:07,880
I don't think that's true

140
00:13:11,360 --> 00:13:13,560
We saw with these eyes

141
00:13:13,560 --> 00:13:15,640
I got it, I got it

142
00:13:15,640 --> 00:13:17,200
The bread is no good,

143
00:13:17,320 --> 00:13:19,720
Boiling Hot Ankake Battle!

144
00:14:08,840 --> 00:14:13,760
Yamasaki-san!  Yamasaki-san!  Yamasaki-san!

145
00:14:13,760 --> 00:14:15,760
That was hilarious

146
00:14:18,620 --> 00:14:21,400
You just can't write a script like this

147
00:14:21,400 --> 00:14:23,400
This is just real life

148
00:14:24,420 --> 00:14:26,080
Yamasaki-san?

149
00:14:26,080 --> 00:14:28,080
You lost again

150
00:14:28,340 --> 00:14:30,640
Hell yeah!

151
00:14:29,140 --> 00:14:30,640
No not "hell yeah"

152
00:14:31,280 --> 00:14:33,660
You can't say "hell yeah"

153
00:14:33,660 --> 00:14:35,380
You can't say "hell yeah" to that

154
00:14:36,200 --> 00:14:37,600
Hamada-san I got it

155
00:14:37,780 --> 00:14:40,580
Yamasaki-san sucks at using tools

156
00:14:43,520 --> 00:14:46,160
So now, right away,

157
00:14:46,160 --> 00:14:48,160
Let's go with the Slapping Battle

158
00:15:40,540 --> 00:15:43,620
Yamsaki-san!  Yamasaki-san!

159
00:15:43,620 --> 00:15:45,920
Why cry?

160
00:15:46,080 --> 00:15:47,920
Are you a sparrow?

161
00:15:52,000 --> 00:15:55,890
That's the first time I've seen someone's back on the rope

162
00:15:55,600 --> 00:15:56,600
What shall we do?

163
00:15:59,280 --> 00:16:02,000
Please allow me to fight properly

164
00:16:02,360 --> 00:16:04,000
We have!

165
00:16:04,460 --> 00:16:07,180
K-1 Battle!

166
00:16:10,000 --> 00:16:12,380
Is it alright doing this battle so soon?

167
00:16:12,380 --> 00:16:15,600
I think this is 2 battles two early,

168
00:16:15,600 --> 00:16:18,260
But it seems Yamasaki-san wants to get this over with

169
00:16:24,660 --> 00:16:26,520
Hamada will be the referee

170
00:16:46,320 --> 00:16:47,320
One!

171
00:16:47,860 --> 00:16:48,860
Two!

172
00:16:49,460 --> 00:16:50,460
Three!

173
00:16:51,080 --> 00:16:52,080
Four!

174
00:16:54,520 --> 00:16:55,520
Six!

175
00:16:55,960 --> 00:16:56,960
Seven!

176
00:16:57,440 --> 00:16:58,340
Eight!

177
00:16:59,140 --> 00:17:00,140
Nine!

178
00:17:01,500 --> 00:17:02,500
Fight!

179
00:17:15,740 --> 00:17:17,240
Sweep!

180
00:17:31,480 --> 00:17:34,480
I can't go on

181
00:17:34,480 --> 00:17:36,650
You can't go on?

182
00:17:35,870 --> 00:17:37,290
Fight!

183
00:17:50,840 --> 00:17:51,840
OK!

184
00:17:55,550 --> 00:17:56,940
C'mon push through!

185
00:17:59,100 --> 00:18:00,600
Down!

186
00:18:01,900 --> 00:18:02,900
One!

187
00:18:04,300 --> 00:18:05,300
Two!

188
00:18:06,900 --> 00:18:07,900
Three!

189
00:18:09,900 --> 00:18:10,900
Four!

190
00:18:11,240 --> 00:18:12,900
You can do it!

191
00:18:13,100 --> 00:18:14,900
Five!

192
00:18:17,900 --> 00:18:18,900
Six!

193
00:18:25,300 --> 00:18:26,300
Seven!

194
00:18:29,240 --> 00:18:30,240
Eight!

195
00:18:30,480 --> 00:18:40,480
AUDIENCE: Stand up! Stand up!

196
00:18:41,340 --> 00:18:42,480
Nine!

197
00:18:54,960 --> 00:18:56,820
Fight!  Fight!

198
00:18:58,640 --> 00:19:00,000
It's already over

199
00:19:03,380 --> 00:19:04,380
Fight!

200
00:19:28,000 --> 00:19:30,040
Yamasaki-san!  Yamasaki-san!

201
00:19:30,040 --> 00:19:32,040
Our stomachs hurt!

202
00:19:41,340 --> 00:19:42,860
Yamasaki-san!

203
00:19:42,860 --> 00:19:44,860
What should the next battle be?

204
00:19:47,080 --> 00:19:48,300
How should we continue?

205
00:19:48,680 --> 00:19:50,480
Moriman!

206
00:19:51,320 --> 00:19:53,000
This is the end for today,

207
00:20:01,760 --> 00:20:06,220
Next time, fight me in a field!

208
00:20:06,220 --> 00:20:07,640
Where the hell is that?

209
00:20:08,320 --> 00:20:09,740
Get outta here asshole!

210
00:20:11,660 --> 00:20:16,300
Audience: Get lost!

211
00:20:16,600 --> 00:20:17,800
Can we end like this?

212
00:20:20,640 --> 00:20:22,420
Go get him

213
00:20:26,660 --> 00:20:29,100
There's so many people here, it can't end like this

214
00:21:05,060 --> 00:21:07,060
Last battle!

215
00:21:11,060 --> 00:21:13,600
HOT TOWEL SMACKING BATTLE!

216
00:21:17,100 --> 00:21:20,440
Your face looks like you just came back from a swimming pool (?)

217
00:21:55,080 --> 00:21:56,760
Yamsaki-san...

218
00:21:57,140 --> 00:22:00,000
Why would you wrap the towel around the rope?

219
00:22:04,060 --> 00:22:06,420
I thought he was gonna bring the rope with him

220
00:22:11,760 --> 00:22:15,420
Everybody... thank y*cough*...

221
00:22:31,220 --> 00:22:34,380
Hey, you guys

222
00:22:36,680 --> 00:22:43,140
They might be able to convince him again, I think so

223
00:22:43,140 --> 00:22:46,420
Maybe if they give him a soft drink or something

224
00:22:46,420 --> 00:22:48,420
Just that?

225
00:22:48,420 --> 00:22:50,300
Maybe a Big Cool

226
00:22:53,960 --> 00:22:55,660
What happened?

227
00:22:57,880 --> 00:22:59,140
What do you mean?

228
00:23:02,140 --> 00:23:06,320
In short, what he repeated over and over again,

229
00:23:06,320 --> 00:23:09,040
"Please spare me"

230
00:23:10,120 --> 00:23:14,820
He said it over, over and over again

231
00:23:15,060 --> 00:23:20,000
And there's something that confused me. Dripping out of his nose...

232
00:23:20,000 --> 00:23:22,000
It wasn't boogers,

233
00:23:22,000 --> 00:23:23,800
It wasn't snot,

234
00:23:23,800 --> 00:23:26,600
But something was dripping out

235
00:23:26,770 --> 00:23:28,500
Yeah

236
00:23:28,500 --> 00:23:33,460
What he wanted to say, to all these people who came here today

237
00:23:33,460 --> 00:23:36,720
Next year, this match can be continued

238
00:23:48,920 --> 00:23:56,060
Tanaka! Tanaka! Tanaka!  Tanaka!

239
00:23:53,920 --> 00:23:56,060
Hold on, wait a minute!

240
00:23:56,060 --> 00:23:58,380
There's two of us, why cheer for me?

241
00:24:00,480 --> 00:24:04,500
Yamasaki vs. Moriman Revenge Match! Settled next year!
