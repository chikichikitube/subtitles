00:00:02,580 --> 00:00:04,650
Welcome to Wednesday Downtown,

2
00:00:07,840 --> 00:00:10,640
Let's get on with our first presenter please

3
00:00:16,050 --> 00:00:18,820
It's Chocolate Planet

4
00:00:19,850 --> 00:00:21,900
It's Matsuo Underground

5
00:00:22,020 --> 00:00:25,140
Yes, the name was changed ten years ago, so don't mention it

6
00:00:25,140 --> 00:00:26,700
Oh really
-Only you would say this name

7
00:00:26,700 --> 00:00:27,700
Don't say it

8
00:00:27,700 --> 00:00:32,060
So, let's get started, who here is on youtube

9
00:00:32,060 --> 00:00:33,290
I am

10
00:00:33,750 --> 00:00:35,880
Do you collaborate with other channels?

11
00:00:35,880 --> 00:00:39,450
With the seniors and of course with the juniors

12
00:00:39,450 --> 00:00:40,320
I see

13
00:00:40,320 --> 00:00:44,240
So this time we bring a theory related to youtube collaboration

14
00:00:44,240 --> 00:00:45,820
Its this

15
00:00:45,820 --> 00:00:52,900
It's hard to refuse troublesome seniors when asked to collaborate on youtube

16
00:00:55,070 --> 00:00:56,940
Troublesome seniors?

17
00:00:57,560 --> 00:01:01,530
Well, Hamada is the meaning of "troublesome senior"

18
00:01:01,530 --> 00:01:03,090
Very true

19
00:01:03,090 --> 00:01:05,610
For troublesome seniors there's no better choice

20
00:01:05,610 --> 00:01:06,290
Really?

21
00:01:06,290 --> 00:01:07,810
Does Planet Chocolate have such seniors too?

22
00:01:08,420 --> 00:01:12,530
There have been, yes

23
00:01:12,530 --> 00:01:14,820
Fujimoto, do you have such a senior?

24
00:01:14,820 --> 00:01:20,160
-I haven't had such a wide range of activity, and my knowledge is limited

25
00:01:20,940 --> 00:01:21,610
No? Really?

26
00:01:21,610 --> 00:01:24,090
But, someone comes to mind at least?

27
00:01:24,090 --> 00:01:27,970
Yes, I'd be reluctant if it was that person

28
00:01:27,970 --> 00:01:32,010
Yes, there is.
I haven't said who

29
00:01:32,940 --> 00:01:37,810
So this time involves people involved in youtube

30
00:01:37,810 --> 00:01:43,210
The most reluctant will be forced to upload a video

31
00:01:43,500 --> 00:01:45,320
Its typical Wednesday Downtown

32
00:01:45,750 --> 00:01:49,120
The "real prank" style of verification
-Seriously

33
00:01:49,120 --> 00:01:51,090
Who is the person who set the trap?
-Yes

34
00:01:51,090 --> 00:01:53,090
I most want to know this

35
00:01:53,090 --> 00:01:56,560
It's time to witness another battle without a winner

36
00:01:56,560 --> 00:01:58,500
It's all losers, this time

37
00:02:14,150 --> 00:02:22,750
It's hard to refuse difficult seniors when asked to collaborate on youtube

38
00:02:23,370 --> 00:02:28,260
Therefore, this time, the former artist who is difficult and wants to work together is

39
00:02:33,900 --> 00:02:36,430
Why are we doing this?

40
00:02:36,430 --> 00:02:39,610
42 years of experience Kuniko Yamada

41
00:02:39,600 --> 00:02:41,210
Does this person understand the meaning of the program?

42
00:02:40,760 --> 00:02:43,650
Hello, I'm Kuniko Yamada

43
00:02:43,900 --> 00:02:45,940
Kuni Channel

44
00:02:46,410 --> 00:02:50,000
She opened her own personal youtube channel two years ago

45
00:02:50,000 --> 00:02:52,850
Kuni Channel, Kuniko Yamada

46
00:02:53,280 --> 00:02:57,560
74,000 followers to date

47
00:02:58,300 --> 00:03:03,820
Nevertheless, her latest videos have only received about 2,000 to 3,000 views

48
00:03:03,820 --> 00:03:07,640
A channel that hardly brings even benefit for collaboration

49
00:03:08,170 --> 00:03:11,400
Don't say it out loud!

50
00:03:09,180 --> 00:03:13,930
So, the setting of the ambush is at a studio

51
00:03:14,910 --> 00:03:19,680
Kuniko Yamada herself seeks co-production

52
00:03:21,580 --> 00:03:22,450
Oh no

53
00:03:25,580 --> 00:03:26,320
First

54
00:03:27,160 --> 00:03:28,790
Good morning

55
00:03:29,020 --> 00:03:33,330
Matenrou's Anthony

56
00:03:34,590 --> 00:03:37,260
Anthony?
-Hello. First time we've met

57
00:03:37,260 --> 00:03:38,830
I'm Anthony from Matenrou

58
00:03:38,830 --> 00:03:40,630
I'm Kuniko Yamada.
-Of course

59
00:03:40,630 --> 00:03:42,560
So happy!
-Thank you

60
00:03:42,770 --> 00:03:44,100
Excuse me

61
00:03:44,420 --> 00:03:46,970
You're from the north, right?
-Yes, I am

62
00:03:46,970 --> 00:03:49,440
I am from Itabashi district

63
00:03:49,440 --> 00:03:51,580
Really? I'm also from Icha

64
00:03:51,580 --> 00:03:54,510
Yes, I wanted to meet you.
-Thank you

65
00:03:54,840 --> 00:04:00,250
They begin by talking about their hometown, then...

66
00:04:00,250 --> 00:04:04,820
I've been working my ass off on youtube for over 2 years.
-Yeah, sure, I've heard that

67
00:04:04,820 --> 00:04:05,690
No way!

68
00:04:06,730 --> 00:04:07,680
The dick one

69
00:04:09,090 --> 00:04:10,060
I enjoyed it

70
00:04:10,560 --> 00:04:11,500
I am telling the truth

71
00:04:11,500 --> 00:04:15,870
The fan base is only 70,000

72
00:04:15,870 --> 00:04:19,480
I want to be popular like you seriously.
-No, no, I don't have any fans at all

73
00:04:19,480 --> 00:04:21,340
Can you shoot with me?

74
00:04:22,880 --> 00:04:23,580
Dumbfounded

75
00:04:23,280 --> 00:04:24,710
Ok... ok

76
00:04:24,710 --> 00:04:27,080
Collaboration?
-Yes, yes, yes

77
00:04:27,080 --> 00:04:28,110
It's impossible not to

78
00:04:28,110 --> 00:04:29,950
It's impossible

79
00:04:29,950 --> 00:04:31,880
Can you shoot with me?

80
00:04:33,820 --> 00:04:35,090
Ok... ok

81
00:04:35,290 --> 00:04:37,820
Although there was a strange pause

82
00:04:37,060 --> 00:04:38,140
Really can't

83
00:04:37,820 --> 00:04:41,330
Anthony agrees

84
00:04:38,140 --> 00:04:40,140
Can you answer more appropriately?

85
00:04:40,530 --> 00:04:42,100
Such a poor reply

86
00:04:41,460 --> 00:04:43,460
What can we do together?

87
00:04:43,460 --> 00:04:45,300
I'm getting excited.
-No, no

88
00:04:45,460 --> 00:04:47,770
I'm so happy. Is it really possible?
-Thank you

89
00:04:47,770 --> 00:04:49,670
Yes, yes.
-Does it bother you a bit?

90
00:04:49,670 --> 00:04:50,900
No no no no no no such thing

91
00:04:50,900 --> 00:04:51,700
Sorry for the suddenness

92
00:04:51,700 --> 00:04:54,640
It's okay. It's okay. It's totally okay.
-I'm sorry to say this in the hallway

93
00:04:54,520 --> 00:04:58,130
It's hard to say no in person

94
00:04:54,640 --> 00:04:56,540
I'd appreciate it

95
00:04:56,740 --> 00:04:57,610
Really?
-Yes.

96
00:04:57,610 --> 00:05:00,350
If the itinerary fits.
-No problem, no problem

97
00:05:00,350 --> 00:05:01,710
Yes, thank you

98
00:05:01,910 --> 00:05:07,220
No matter what, there is no way to say no in front of people outright

99
00:05:07,390 --> 00:05:10,960
What are his actual thoughts?

100
00:05:13,890 --> 00:05:15,560
Who were you with just now?

101
00:05:15,560 --> 00:05:18,360
Kuniko Yamada

102
00:05:18,360 --> 00:05:23,640
The first time meeting her, I was scared to death!

103
00:05:23,640 --> 00:05:29,610
I heard it so loud from here
-It really scared me

104
00:05:30,110 --> 00:05:32,110
What'd you talk about?

105
00:05:32,110 --> 00:05:35,050
Do something on Youtube together or something

106
00:05:35,550 --> 00:05:42,150
But the viewers of her channel and mine...

107
00:05:42,150 --> 00:05:49,060
It's really like the difference between a program about Go and Terrace House

108
00:05:48,260 --> 00:05:51,420
That's too much

109
00:05:50,130 --> 00:05:53,430
And Yamada Kuniko...

110
00:05:53,430 --> 00:05:55,500
What to do? Shoot together?

111
00:05:57,470 --> 00:06:00,370
It's not going to be filmed, is it?
-No?

112
00:06:00,410 --> 00:06:05,510
No energy to get along

113
00:06:05,780 --> 00:06:11,650
Ultimately, the most resistant artist was selected

114
00:06:12,120 --> 00:06:17,190
They are subsequently forced to make a video together with Kuniko Yamada

115
00:06:14,300 --> 00:06:15,120
As a punishment

116
00:06:17,460 --> 00:06:19,320
How did you explain this to her?

117
00:06:19,560 --> 00:06:25,600
Which will be uploaded to the channel

118
00:06:25,860 --> 00:06:34,240
Collaboration trial

119
00:06:26,280 --> 00:06:30,620
So, Anthony passed the first stage for now

120
00:06:30,850 --> 00:06:33,840
We proceed to the next stage of the test

121
00:06:34,890 --> 00:06:37,380
Next, the second person is

122
00:06:37,740 --> 00:06:38,380
Nadal?

123
00:06:39,330 --> 00:06:42,560
Korokoro Chikichiki Peppers Nadal

124
00:06:42,560 --> 00:06:43,720
Seems like it'll be bad

125
00:06:43,020 --> 00:06:46,750
I'm Kuniko Yamada. First time we met.
-Excuse me, I'm Nadal

126
00:06:43,720 --> 00:06:45,010
Do not say anything bad!

127
00:06:46,750 --> 00:06:48,850
It's the first time we met, right? I don't think we've met before

128
00:06:48,850 --> 00:06:49,790
Yes, yes

129
00:06:49,790 --> 00:06:52,760
I've been wanting to meet you. I'm so happy.
-Really? Thank you

130
00:06:52,760 --> 00:06:55,590
I've started a youtube channel

131
00:06:55,590 --> 00:06:58,700
The number of fans has not been able to go up

132
00:06:58,700 --> 00:07:01,070
But it's still fun to shoot.
-That's for sure

133
00:07:01,070 --> 00:07:05,740
If there's a chance, I've been talking to my agent about working together

134
00:07:05,740 --> 00:07:07,810
No problem at all.
-Really?

135
00:07:07,810 --> 00:07:08,770
Really really?

136
00:07:08,770 --> 00:07:10,880
You're a big star. I'm honored.
-Really?

137
00:07:10,880 --> 00:07:12,180
That's for sure

138
00:07:13,080 --> 00:07:14,610
Now you are so popular

139
00:07:14,610 --> 00:07:16,110
I'm so happy, my throat is a little dry

140
00:07:16,210 --> 00:07:18,880
Why drink water at this time

141
00:07:19,120 --> 00:07:23,740
Nadal, who is still rude as always even in front of big stars

142
00:07:24,060 --> 00:07:25,450
What he really thinks is

143
00:07:24,900 --> 00:07:27,820
Why drink water in front of seniors?

144
00:07:25,890 --> 00:07:29,990
Did you just talk to someone?
-Oh, what?

145
00:07:34,240 --> 00:07:36,600
This is really too much

146
00:07:39,400 --> 00:07:41,840
Kuniko Yamada

147
00:07:41,840 --> 00:07:46,610
Yamada Kuniko said she wanted to do a collaboration with me or something.
-Eh? Youtube?

148
00:07:49,410 --> 00:07:52,380
Seems like she does a lot

149
00:07:52,380 --> 00:07:57,220
More than 200 videos have been uploaded...
-More than 200 and still not going well?

150
00:07:57,690 --> 00:08:02,590
After all, she's past her time

151
00:08:00,930 --> 00:08:04,260
How outrageous!

152
00:08:04,930 --> 00:08:09,170
Dress-up as the Beijing Olympic Games Dog only 816 views

153
00:08:09,430 --> 00:08:11,040
Its a panda

154
00:08:11,040 --> 00:08:11,640
Panda?

155
00:08:12,200 --> 00:08:13,570
I see

156
00:08:13,770 --> 00:08:17,680
What do we do? Accept it?
-Yes, no problem at all

157
00:08:17,680 --> 00:08:19,280
Do it, then?
-Yes

158
00:08:19,280 --> 00:08:23,080
She'll probably be in touch later.
-Okay, I got it

159
00:08:21,760 --> 00:08:23,380
Although his attitude is very bad, he'll still go along with it

160
00:08:23,410 --> 00:08:28,290
Despite the rude behavior, he agrees fast

161
00:08:28,750 --> 00:08:32,600
So, at this stage, we tell Nadal the truth

162
00:08:35,960 --> 00:08:38,760
I really had no clue

163
00:08:38,760 --> 00:08:41,070
Although this is typical Wednesday

164
00:08:41,070 --> 00:08:42,900
I don't get it

165
00:08:42,900 --> 00:08:45,000
What?

166
00:08:45,000 --> 00:08:49,240
It's a lie.
-A lie?

167
00:08:49,470 --> 00:08:52,610
This time the theory is

168
00:08:52,610 --> 00:08:57,320
It's hard to refuse troublesome seniors when asked to collaborate on youtube

169
00:08:54,190 --> 00:08:54,860
Don't say it!

170
00:08:57,320 --> 00:08:59,920
I didn't say anything about Yamada being troublesome

171
00:08:59,920 --> 00:09:04,020
Only troublesome people can get ahead

172
00:09:04,220 --> 00:09:05,790
I see

173
00:09:06,690 --> 00:09:11,600
I don't think Yamada is troublesome

174
00:09:11,600 --> 00:09:13,870
The only person that's really hard to get along with is Honkon

175
00:09:13,870 --> 00:09:14,830
Although I'm not really sure

176
00:09:14,830 --> 00:09:16,770
No, I'm not sure

177
00:09:17,380 --> 00:09:20,250
The next target is...

178
00:09:24,650 --> 00:09:26,500
Onigoe Tomahawk

179
00:09:28,310 --> 00:09:29,910
I am Kuniko Yamada

180
00:09:30,050 --> 00:09:33,920
It's tomahawk, isn't it?

181
00:09:33,920 --> 00:09:36,620
I always said I wanted to work with you guys

182
00:09:36,620 --> 00:09:37,940
Never met

183
00:09:37,940 --> 00:09:42,190
Collab, right?
-It's a good match. On youtube, is that ok?

184
00:09:42,630 --> 00:09:45,860
Definitely.
-I took the liberty of saying so

185
00:09:45,860 --> 00:09:46,970
Really?
-Yes

186
00:09:46,970 --> 00:09:49,830
What kind of... we both have no problem at all

187
00:09:49,970 --> 00:09:51,270
I am almost as old as your mother, right?

188
00:09:51,270 --> 00:09:55,070
But I was concerned when you and Hachi Hiro argued

189
00:09:51,270 --> 00:09:57,380
{In 1987, when he appeared on a wrestling variety show hosted by Kuniko Yamada, he became furious over a rude question from Kuniko

190
00:09:55,070 --> 00:09:57,380
That's too long ago

191
00:09:57,380 --> 00:10:00,580
Kuniko Yamada, would someone say that as soon as they get out of the elevator?

192
00:10:00,580 --> 00:10:02,510
Yamada Kuniko really exists!

193
00:10:02,510 --> 00:10:05,550
Surprisingly quite beautiful
-Yes

194
00:10:05,550 --> 00:10:09,450
I did not expect her to pay attention to newcomers

195
00:10:10,010 --> 00:10:15,860
They have the look of being happy that the other party knows them

196
00:10:16,210 --> 00:10:19,660
And then, for the matter of the collaboration

197
00:10:19,930 --> 00:10:21,570
Then to adjust the itinerary

198
00:10:21,570 --> 00:10:24,300
Want to do it, definitely
-Got it

199
00:10:24,820 --> 00:10:26,440
Immediately decided

200
00:10:26,810 --> 00:10:27,770
In addition

201
00:10:28,010 --> 00:10:31,880
We'll dig into her past and try to inquire about it and so on

202
00:10:31,880 --> 00:10:34,610
What's wrong with "ranking narrow-minded artists in important towns" or something like that?

203
00:10:34,680 --> 00:10:40,820
The two people immediately started to consider the content of the joint project

204
00:10:41,360 --> 00:10:45,260
So, these two are not in line with the theory

205
00:10:45,580 --> 00:10:47,190
Thus, we immediately come to tell them both the truth

206
00:10:46,700 --> 00:10:48,720
A strange phenomenon

207
00:10:54,600 --> 00:10:57,200
This is Wednesday Downtown

208
00:10:57,200 --> 00:11:00,470
Did I get pranked?

209
00:11:00,470 --> 00:11:01,340
No, nothing happened, right?

210
00:11:06,340 --> 00:11:07,780
Good Morning
-Good morning

211
00:11:07,780 --> 00:11:09,550
We just met

212
00:11:09,550 --> 00:11:12,880
You're out
-Out?

213
00:11:12,880 --> 00:11:14,320
What's going on?

214
00:11:14,820 --> 00:11:20,450
We explained the project to the two people who did not understand the situation

215
00:11:20,830 --> 00:11:24,000
I really didn't think it was troublesome

216
00:11:24,000 --> 00:11:27,030
We quite like Kuniko, probably since we were young

217
00:11:27,600 --> 00:11:29,730
You're lying!

218
00:11:29,730 --> 00:11:33,970
You weren't even tadpoles yet
-Tadpoles... what a dirty joke

219
00:11:33,970 --> 00:11:36,940
Please don't say that, really. That's probably why

220
00:11:38,940 --> 00:11:40,610
No, no, no

221
00:11:40,610 --> 00:11:41,910
Isn't that very bad to get along with?

222
00:11:43,010 --> 00:11:44,450
Now is the worst time to do this, right?

223
00:11:44,950 --> 00:11:48,120
We do not know this, if we knew then...

224
00:11:48,390 --> 00:11:52,920
Our contemporary Natsuko's style is very much like yours

225
00:11:52,920 --> 00:11:55,230
She and I were born in the same hospital

226
00:11:55,230 --> 00:11:58,130
Kazuko

227
00:11:58,130 --> 00:12:00,330
Not the same day, of course

228
00:12:03,500 --> 00:12:04,500
Are you up for working today?

229
00:12:04,940 --> 00:12:06,500
No way no way

230
00:12:06,770 --> 00:12:08,940
Is this the place?
-This is the place

231
00:12:09,370 --> 00:12:11,680
The final target is...

232
00:12:13,910 --> 00:12:15,080
I am Kuniko Yamada

233
00:12:16,060 --> 00:12:18,330
Goodbye Light of Youth

234
00:12:19,720 --> 00:12:22,450
Wow, awesome. Its really them

235
00:12:23,210 --> 00:12:25,500
I'm sorry, are you here for a program?
-Yes

236
00:12:27,560 --> 00:12:30,250
Oh, wow, I'm so happy.
-What's going on?

237
00:12:30,250 --> 00:12:32,660
I was just about to leave
-Ah, so...

238
00:12:32,660 --> 00:12:35,630
Can we stand and talk for a minute?
-Eh... you know us?

239
00:12:35,630 --> 00:12:37,460
I do, Morita, right?

240
00:12:37,700 --> 00:12:40,070
Ah... what're you called?

241
00:12:40,700 --> 00:12:43,780
After a few moments of good banter...

242
00:12:43,940 --> 00:12:50,130
I don't know if we can do it together, but I want to do it together

243
00:12:50,130 --> 00:12:51,320
In other words I want to rub some heat in

244
00:12:51,420 --> 00:12:53,320
"Rub some heat in?"

245
00:12:53,320 --> 00:12:54,590
You'd say something so directly?

246
00:12:54,590 --> 00:12:56,690
Don't, don't, don't come so close with your hands

247
00:12:56,690 --> 00:12:59,320
What's that for?
-There are no seniors or juniors as good as you!

248
00:12:59,320 --> 00:13:00,690
No no no no no no no

249
00:13:00,690 --> 00:13:01,690
You guys are great!

250
00:13:01,690 --> 00:13:04,530
No, no, no, nothing great

251
00:13:04,530 --> 00:13:07,200
Really? Just this little request

252
00:13:07,200 --> 00:13:08,930
I think you must be very busy

253
00:13:08,390 --> 00:13:09,510
The reaction is very subtle

254
00:13:09,770 --> 00:13:11,470
Can we shoot together?

255
00:13:11,470 --> 00:13:13,540
A joint shoot? With us?

256
00:13:13,540 --> 00:13:14,570
Collaboration?

257
00:13:15,240 --> 00:13:18,650
Probably because of watching this movement of being pulled out

258
00:13:19,860 --> 00:13:23,500
The two are ambiguous for a while without a clear statement

259
00:13:21,400 --> 00:13:24,760
Wandering eyes

260
00:13:24,220 --> 00:13:25,550
If we can do something together

261
00:13:25,550 --> 00:13:27,850
No, no, what? Is there such a move to beg?

262
00:13:27,850 --> 00:13:30,790
I don't know. I don't know either

263
00:13:30,790 --> 00:13:32,820
So can I be optimistic...

264
00:13:32,820 --> 00:13:35,130
Yes, no problem
-Really?

265
00:13:35,130 --> 00:13:37,500
Yes
-Too happy!

266
00:13:37,500 --> 00:13:40,500
We're honored that you would offer
-Yes

267
00:13:40,700 --> 00:13:43,840
I've just been haunted by Kuniko Yamada

268
00:13:47,440 --> 00:13:49,640
What's going on? Talked to Yamada?

269
00:13:49,640 --> 00:13:53,280
As soon as she got out of the elevator, she stood there with a "wow its them" look

270
00:13:54,080 --> 00:13:57,450
A bit like a bothersome fan

271
00:13:57,450 --> 00:14:00,380
Saying something like "lets collaborate"

272
00:14:00,380 --> 00:14:01,990
Youtube?
-Yeah

273
00:14:01,990 --> 00:14:04,390
How about it, then?

274
00:14:07,770 --> 00:14:10,190
Definitely wont do it!

275
00:14:10,190 --> 00:14:13,160
Maybe she's still here

276
00:14:13,160 --> 00:14:16,830
If you want to do it, do it

277
00:14:16,830 --> 00:14:20,940
If you don't want to do it, you can refuse to do it

278
00:14:20,940 --> 00:14:23,710
Refuse?

279
00:14:23,710 --> 00:14:25,380
She's an important senior

280
00:14:25,380 --> 00:14:27,680
A little scary

281
00:14:27,680 --> 00:14:30,820
She's king of weird
-No, no, she's cheerful

282
00:14:31,050 --> 00:14:33,580
But will it really happen?

283
00:14:33,580 --> 00:14:41,390
Can't you get away with excuses like "the schedule is a bit busy"?

284
00:14:41,830 --> 00:14:48,730
So, Morita seems to be the one most strongly trying to avoid it

285
00:14:48,930 --> 00:14:52,440
So, if they contact us we'll refuse, right?

286
00:14:53,740 --> 00:14:54,710
Yeah I guess

287
00:14:54,710 --> 00:14:58,040
If I have to say, I'm positive

288
00:14:58,400 --> 00:15:03,530
Anyway, two groups want to escape from Kuni Channel's troublesome nature

289
00:15:04,740 --> 00:15:09,680
After a few days, a formal offer was sent through the agent

290
00:15:09,680 --> 00:15:11,250
Moving to the next step

291
00:15:25,480 --> 00:15:28,970
After 2 weeks

292
00:15:29,640 --> 00:15:33,570
First, Anthony, who appeared in Talk Live on this day

293
00:15:34,080 --> 00:15:37,570
Is informed of the invitation during a break

294
00:15:38,580 --> 00:15:41,390
Do you remember when you met Kuniko Yamada at TMC?

295
00:15:41,820 --> 00:15:43,190
Yeah

296
00:15:43,590 --> 00:15:47,060
It's a real invitation.

297
00:15:49,930 --> 00:15:58,340
Her agent said that the thing that we talked about before...
-You mean the collab thing?

298
00:15:53,540 --> 00:15:57,420
Tissue touching

299
00:15:58,340 --> 00:16:02,740
Yes, the other party is quite enthusiastic about the joint shoot

300
00:16:02,740 --> 00:16:06,010
But its a little...

301
00:16:07,140 --> 00:16:12,950
Anthony is shocked that it had happened

302
00:16:13,380 --> 00:16:15,920
Although the situation is not clear, the other party seems to have sent a proposal or something

303
00:16:15,920 --> 00:16:18,890
The plan is here, what do we do?

304
00:16:19,420 --> 00:16:24,660
The program team has prepared a special plan

305
00:16:24,660 --> 00:16:52,260
2 people alone burst of laughing conversation ensemble! What new characters will be born in the end?!

306
00:16:24,660 --> 00:16:52,260
A  segment in which Kuniko Yamada improvises and messes with a Matenrou skit

Kuniko Yamada improvised and messed up?

312
00:16:24,660 --> 00:16:52,260
Kuniko Yamada laughs 100 times outside

313
00:16:24,660 --> 00:16:52,260
Kuniko Yamada uses ○× to judge Anthony's pretending to be stupid in the outside scene

314
00:16:24,660 --> 00:16:52,260
Kuniko Yamada's impromptu participation in the segments of comedians

315
00:16:24,660 --> 00:16:52,260
Laugh at Yamada! "The Wall of Yamada"

318

Yamada plays dumb on her own, can she develop a new type of routine?

333
00:16:37,710 --> 00:16:39,340
Super embarrassing for me

334
00:16:39,340 --> 00:16:43,450
Talking with Kuniko Yamada as a character I don't know

335
00:16:43,450 --> 00:16:45,120
Others who see will think "what the hell?"

336
00:16:45,120 --> 00:16:47,280
There's no explanation.
-That's right

337
00:16:48,400 --> 00:16:51,640
Sure enough, Anthony was very reluctant to cooperate

338
00:16:52,810 --> 00:16:55,100
On the other hand, in between the outside scenes

339
00:16:55,500 --> 00:16:59,050
The other duo are informed of the invitation

340
00:16:59,330 --> 00:17:03,200
They wrote a proposal?
-There's an email.

341
00:17:05,200 --> 00:17:08,170
It says "Please, really"

00:17:18,650 --> 00:17:21,750
Kuniko's wall?

350
00:17:24,920 --> 00:17:27,430
I can't take it!

351
00:17:27,430 --> 00:17:29,690
After all, it is a project

352
00:17:29,970 --> 00:17:33,130
One doesn't work?

353
00:17:35,830 --> 00:17:38,240
Neither do 2 or 3

354
00:17:38,700 --> 00:17:39,460
But

355
00:17:40,240 --> 00:17:44,310
But how to say, our taste is still too different

356
00:17:44,710 --> 00:17:50,780
It's not the same thing as what our channel is doing

357
00:17:51,150 --> 00:17:53,480
Does it have to be a collaboration?

358
00:17:53,480 --> 00:17:57,620
What, like we're making an appearance on her side?
-Can't we just make an appearance?

359
00:17:57,790 --> 00:18:00,120
First we shoot each other's

360
00:18:00,120 --> 00:18:05,730
Then our planning side will decide separately whether to shoot or not

361
00:18:05,730 --> 00:18:09,200
Are you really considering taking on this project? Seriously.
-Sort of

362
00:18:10,210 --> 00:18:15,310
They are now at the point of compromising

363
00:18:15,740 --> 00:18:17,510
Yamada Kuniko should be more, how to put it

364
00:18:17,510 --> 00:18:20,950
A little higher level

365
00:18:20,950 --> 00:18:24,550
Kamaitachi etc could do it, right?

366
00:18:24,550 --> 00:18:26,380
Its weird

367
00:18:26,380 --> 00:18:29,590
The Matenrou skit added in...

368
00:18:29,720 --> 00:18:35,290
But I think she said she wanted to shoot with Anthony
-Seriously?

369
00:18:36,860 --> 00:18:39,130
Although much appreciated

370
00:18:39,130 --> 00:18:43,800
None of my channel's fans want to see her, right?

371
00:18:44,260 --> 00:18:48,770
A very reluctant Anthony

372
00:18:49,330 --> 00:18:50,750
So

373
00:18:50,750 --> 00:18:52,250
A little...

374
00:18:52,410 --> 00:18:53,920
A little...

375
00:18:53,920 --> 00:18:58,220
I'm sorry, but it's too early for me

376
00:18:58,400 --> 00:19:00,850
So, let's get right to the point, you don't want to do it, right?

377
00:19:01,350 --> 00:19:04,290
You understand what I mean, you don't have to say it out loud

378
00:19:05,860 --> 00:19:08,160
That guy is hinting.
-The agent is also at fault

379
00:19:08,610 --> 00:19:13,330
I still haven't heard back from my side

380
00:19:13,330 --> 00:19:16,700
If the schedule works out, we'll be on her side

381
00:19:16,700 --> 00:19:22,410
If its just an appearance, it'll be fine

382
00:19:23,140 --> 00:19:27,740
In this way, this time Anthony, who had been the most reluctant

383
00:19:28,050 --> 00:19:31,320
Is confirmed for Kuni Channel's co-production

384
00:19:31,320 --> 00:19:32,250
So that's how it is

385
00:19:36,220 --> 00:19:42,200
So, the truth is revealed to the others

386
00:19:44,200 --> 00:19:45,060
What is it?

387
00:19:45,060 --> 00:19:47,360
Thank you for your hard work

388
00:19:47,530 --> 00:19:48,830
What?

389
00:19:48,830 --> 00:19:50,100
Its Wednesday Downtown

390
00:19:50,100 --> 00:19:54,000
What is it? Wednesday?

391
00:19:54,010 --> 00:19:56,840
Anything strange happened recently?

392
00:19:56,840 --> 00:19:58,540
Recent strange events

393
00:19:59,080 --> 00:20:00,310
What?

394
00:20:00,310 --> 00:20:05,780
The drinking game?
-The drinking game?

395
00:20:05,780 --> 00:20:11,090
I drank with a girl who said she was super into me
-No

396
00:20:11,090 --> 00:20:14,360
No?
-That was extra information

397
00:20:14,530 --> 00:20:17,290
"Super into me"

398
00:20:17,290 --> 00:20:19,160
But I didn't bring her home...?

399
00:20:19,160 --> 00:20:20,700
It has nothing to do with that

400
00:20:20,700 --> 00:20:21,400
Completely unrelated

401
00:20:21,400 --> 00:20:22,870
Not that...
-No one asked you about that

402
00:20:23,530 --> 00:20:24,970
That wasn't a prank?

403
00:20:25,480 --> 00:20:29,240
So, we tell them about the project

404
00:20:29,440 --> 00:20:32,740
You decided she is troublesome

405
00:20:32,740 --> 00:20:35,080
She's not troublesome

406
00:20:35,080 --> 00:20:36,950
It wasn't a bother to us at all

407
00:20:36,950 --> 00:20:38,020
She's super nice

408
00:20:38,120 --> 00:20:41,820
Then why did you want to refuse when you were asked?

409
00:20:41,820 --> 00:20:42,650
What?

410
00:20:42,650 --> 00:20:45,590
You complained a lot.
-Yes, he did

411
00:20:45,790 --> 00:20:48,830
We saw it all

412
00:20:48,290 --> 00:20:49,080
Scary

413
00:20:49,430 --> 00:20:52,030
Morita was super tempted to refuse

414
00:20:52,030 --> 00:20:54,090
I don't think it matters

415
00:20:54,090 --> 00:20:55,030
Morita's words

416
00:20:55,330 --> 00:20:57,230
I didn't complain, did I?
-You did

417
00:20:57,230 --> 00:21:00,170
Did I say that? I didn't say that

418
00:21:00,170 --> 00:21:02,670
You said it
-Liar!

419
00:21:02,670 --> 00:21:04,780
About this project

420
00:21:04,780 --> 00:21:08,610
Two are already out

421
00:21:08,610 --> 00:21:11,620
The one who absolutely didn't want to do it

422
00:21:12,540 --> 00:21:14,820
A sigh of relief

423
00:21:12,850 --> 00:21:14,990
They'll really shoot

424
00:21:15,120 --> 00:21:16,650
There are more reluctant people out there, right?

425
00:21:16,650 --> 00:21:20,560
Yes, Anthony was super reluctant

426
00:21:20,560 --> 00:21:23,130
Anthony doesn't want to

427
00:21:23,530 --> 00:21:25,360
By a narrow margin, Anthony won

428
00:21:25,360 --> 00:21:29,330
Ah thank go- ok, yes

429
00:21:29,730 --> 00:21:33,900
In short, a week after Anthony turned down the offer

430
00:21:35,400 --> 00:21:38,770
He took the opportunity to visit the Tokyo studio again

431
00:21:39,080 --> 00:21:43,950
Kuniko Yamada herself comes to deliver a fatal blow to him

432
00:21:45,980 --> 00:21:47,250
Yes?

433
00:21:47,450 --> 00:21:48,440
Troublesome knocking

434
00:21:48,440 --> 00:21:50,160
Really troublesome knocking

435
00:21:50,450 --> 00:21:52,390
Antony

436
00:21:52,390 --> 00:21:54,190
Good morning

437
00:21:54,190 --> 00:21:58,630
Your name's on the door

438
00:21:58,630 --> 00:22:02,200
Did you reject the collab?
-No, no, no

439
00:22:02,200 --> 00:22:03,770
It's a bit
-No, no, no

440
00:22:04,670 --> 00:22:07,470
Please.
-I didn't say no

441
00:22:07,470 --> 00:22:10,110
Anthony, please

442
00:22:10,210 --> 00:22:11,680
It's like a dream, really

443
00:22:11,680 --> 00:22:13,880
What?
-It's like a dream

444
00:22:14,210 --> 00:22:19,220
If it's a dream, it's a nightmare

445
00:22:19,220 --> 00:22:23,920
The agent seems to have sent you something like a project book

446
00:22:23,350 --> 00:22:25,390
Yes yes yes yes

447
00:22:23,920 --> 00:22:25,390
You didn't even look at it?

448
00:22:25,390 --> 00:22:27,290
Ah... yes yes

449
00:22:27,290 --> 00:22:29,460
No no, I did a little

450
00:22:29,460 --> 00:22:31,500
Please!

451
00:22:31,630 --> 00:22:35,370
They didn't really explain it well to me

452
00:22:35,370 --> 00:22:38,700
I know I didn't do it very well.
-I'm sorry

453
00:22:36,120 --> 00:22:38,650
Blame it on Yoshimoto.
-It's the company's fault

454
00:22:39,140 --> 00:22:41,910
Wait a second

455
00:22:41,910 --> 00:22:44,840
Damn, they're all super high calorie

456
00:22:44,840 --> 00:22:47,040
"Make Kuniko Yamada laugh 100 times on location?"

457
00:22:47,040 --> 00:22:50,250
A project that makes me laugh 100 times or something like that

458
00:22:51,320 --> 00:22:53,120
Laugh 100 times...

459
00:22:54,020 --> 00:22:57,090
There is also a plan for two people to chat for a long time and so on
-Long time chat

460
00:22:57,090 --> 00:22:58,720
There are various projects

461
00:22:59,090 --> 00:23:00,860
Definitely No...definitely

462
00:23:03,490 --> 00:23:06,700
It's super bad. What is this?

463
00:23:07,030 --> 00:23:08,000
I am very eager to do it

464
00:23:08,000 --> 00:23:10,500
I'm very grateful

465
00:23:10,500 --> 00:23:12,870
Just schedule-wise
-Yeah

466
00:23:12,870 --> 00:23:14,470
Yes, yes, that's the only thing.
-You're busy, right?

467
00:23:14,470 --> 00:23:16,540
I'm not busy at all

468
00:23:16,340 --> 00:23:17,520
You want to refuse again?

469
00:23:16,540 --> 00:23:18,040
Just this little...

470
00:23:18,040 --> 00:23:20,440
Do it!

471
00:23:20,440 --> 00:23:22,510
I'm looking forward to it. I'm looking forward to it.
-Really?

472
00:23:22,510 --> 00:23:24,250
Yes, really, absolutely

473
00:23:24,450 --> 00:23:26,880
So, let's get right to the point, you don't want to do it, right?

474
00:23:27,480 --> 00:23:30,320
You understand what I mean, you don't have to say it out loud

475
00:23:30,420 --> 00:23:32,390
Absolutely?
-Absolutely

476
00:23:32,390 --> 00:23:34,530
Absolutely?
-Absolutely, sure

477
00:23:34,530 --> 00:23:36,460
It's OK?
-Of course, of course

478
00:23:36,460 --> 00:23:37,630
Really?
-Yes

479
00:23:37,630 --> 00:23:39,440
Thank you

480
00:23:39,900 --> 00:23:46,840
In a situation where there was no way to escape, the agreement of Anthony OK was obtained

481
00:23:54,110 --> 00:23:56,250
Uhhhhh

482
00:23:58,990 --> 00:24:01,220
Uhhhh

483
00:24:06,120 --> 00:24:12,330
An unimaginable amount of reluctance

484
00:24:10,680 --> 00:24:14,580
Looks so troubled

485
00:24:12,500 --> 00:24:14,670
So, we reveal the truth

486
00:24:14,580 --> 00:24:16,730
Is it that tiring?

487
00:24:19,870 --> 00:24:21,870
Thank you for your hard work

488
00:24:21,870 --> 00:24:23,540
Thank you for your hard work...

489
00:24:23,770 --> 00:24:26,610
This is Wednesday Downtown

490
00:24:26,610 --> 00:24:29,150
Did anything strange happen?

491
00:24:29,150 --> 00:24:31,110
Strange things?

492
00:24:31,110 --> 00:24:32,820
As far as what just happened

493
00:24:32,820 --> 00:24:39,090
Oh wow, that's what happened!

494
00:24:39,090 --> 00:24:41,530
Kuniko Yamada

495
00:24:41,530 --> 00:24:44,830
Uhhh, what the hell is going on?

496
00:24:44,830 --> 00:24:47,760
The forced collab thing?
-Yes

497
00:24:47,760 --> 00:24:51,130
So why exactly

498
00:24:53,280 --> 00:24:56,010
Wait, what the hell is that...

499
00:24:56,010 --> 00:25:03,480
It's hard to refuse troublesome seniors when asked to collaborate on youtube

500
00:25:07,280 --> 00:25:11,490
For me to refuse?
-Yes

501
00:25:11,490 --> 00:25:13,790
Uh, so bad

502
00:25:13,790 --> 00:25:19,200
It's too much. It's too much. So that's what happened

503
00:25:19,300 --> 00:25:22,070
Weren't you sent the proposal some time ago?

504
00:25:23,270 --> 00:25:25,300
That was filmed secretly

505
00:25:25,300 --> 00:25:28,370
That's enough. Don't mess with me

506
00:25:28,370 --> 00:25:30,870
It's too much, really

507
00:25:30,870 --> 00:25:33,340
Uhhhh

508
00:25:33,340 --> 00:25:35,080
It's too much

509
00:25:35,380 --> 00:25:40,650
The next most important notice to Anthony

510
00:25:41,020 --> 00:25:43,790
Anyway, Anthony-san, are you sure you want to work together?

511
00:25:43,790 --> 00:25:46,560
Uhhhh

512
00:25:46,560 --> 00:25:50,590
Uhhhh seriously

513
00:25:50,590 --> 00:25:52,730
What to do

514
00:25:52,730 --> 00:25:57,100
After this, we should probably start talking to her
-Wait a second

515
00:25:57,100 --> 00:25:58,940
I really don't want to

516
00:25:58,940 --> 00:26:00,580
I don't want to be like this but...

517
00:26:00,580 --> 00:26:02,310
Wait a minute, you guys are the devil

518
00:26:02,310 --> 00:26:04,270
The devil's work, really

519
00:26:04,270 --> 00:26:07,160
Because of my reluctance, Yamada already knows about it, right?
-That's right

520
00:26:07,160 --> 00:26:08,910
I've gotta work under those conditions
-Yes

521
00:26:08,910 --> 00:26:11,080
Awful!

522
00:26:11,080 --> 00:26:13,050
This really sucks

523
00:26:13,050 --> 00:26:14,720
Give me a minute

524
00:26:14,720 --> 00:26:17,550
How can I face seeing her after this?

525
00:26:17,790 --> 00:26:20,160
I can't do it, so...

526
00:26:20,160 --> 00:26:22,830
I can't take it!

527
00:26:23,700 --> 00:26:25,730
Too bad...

528
00:26:25,730 --> 00:26:30,500
So, Yamada is waiting for you in the other room, let's go

529
00:26:30,500 --> 00:26:35,940
You guys are the worst

530
00:26:36,520 --> 00:26:38,020
In a nutshell

531
00:26:43,140 --> 00:26:44,730
It's too heavy

532
00:26:44,730 --> 00:26:48,010
What expression should he use to face it

533
00:26:46,080 --> 00:26:49,490
What are you muttering about there?

534
00:26:49,490 --> 00:26:51,820
I saw it just it, just saw it

535
00:26:53,490 --> 00:26:54,830
I'm really sorry

536
00:26:54,830 --> 00:26:55,590
What are you doing?

537
00:26:55,590 --> 00:26:58,030
I'm really sorry

538
00:26:58,200 --> 00:27:00,900
I'm really, really sorry.
-What are you talking about? What are you talking about?

539
00:27:00,900 --> 00:27:04,600
I'm really sorry.
-Why? Stop it. Really stop it

540
00:27:04,960 --> 00:27:07,470
You are really quite reluctant

541
00:27:07,470 --> 00:27:10,070
No, not reluctant
-Super troublesome senior and so on

542
00:27:10,070 --> 00:27:11,440
No... no

543
00:27:11,440 --> 00:27:13,400
No reluctance, it's a misunderstanding

544
00:27:14,600 --> 00:27:18,150
After apologizing for a while on the floor

545
00:27:18,480 --> 00:27:23,290
They immediately begin discussing the content of the joint video

546
00:27:23,290 --> 00:27:26,260
Its good to converse, its a good contrast.
-Really?

547
00:27:26,820 --> 00:27:30,690
It is indeed rare to have such a chance for two people to talk alone
-Very unique

548
00:27:30,690 --> 00:27:33,630
It's true that we haven't had much chance to meet so far.
-I guess so

549
00:27:33,830 --> 00:27:36,100
It is possible to put aside the content of those projects written before

550
00:27:36,100 --> 00:27:38,870
Although there is something written "make me laugh 100 times"

551
00:27:38,870 --> 00:27:40,270
Which one do you think is better?

552
00:27:40,270 --> 00:27:42,410
Wait a minute, Yamada

553
00:27:42,410 --> 00:27:45,610
You are inconsistent, you just said the conversation is good

554
00:27:45,610 --> 00:27:47,980
Talking really is the best

555
00:27:47,980 --> 00:27:49,650
But what characters should we play?

556
00:27:49,650 --> 00:27:52,050
For example, grandpa and grandma and so on

557
00:27:52,050 --> 00:27:55,990
You mean the tone of voice should always be like this?

558
00:27:55,990 --> 00:27:58,010
Yes, Anthony

559
00:28:00,170 --> 00:28:01,290
So troublesome

560
00:28:01,290 --> 00:28:10,770
So, this time, the joint project will be a cross-dressing talk with Yamada's most recommended character

561
00:28:11,120 --> 00:28:13,250
Hello, Kuni Channel

562
00:28:16,510 --> 00:28:18,340
Thank you

563
00:28:18,340 --> 00:28:21,950
How was it? The shoot is over

564
00:28:21,950 --> 00:28:24,720
Didn't I already say that?

565
00:28:24,720 --> 00:28:26,550
That... that...

566
00:28:26,550 --> 00:28:29,750
Definitely not a good fit

567
00:28:30,920 --> 00:28:33,460
Is that really going to be uploaded?

568
00:28:33,460 --> 00:28:35,760
Yes it will...

569
00:28:39,260 --> 00:28:48,980
In summary
The collab video will be released after the show, so be sure to check it out!

570
00:28:51,260 --> 00:28:53,520
So, that's how it went

571
00:28:54,240 --> 00:28:58,280
Anthony really was reluctant

572
00:28:58,280 --> 00:29:00,850
His face was swollen

573
00:29:00,850 --> 00:29:02,980
Looked like he'd just woken up and hadn't drunk any water

574
00:29:02,980 --> 00:29:05,320
That's what happened. I think his face was swollen

575
00:29:06,010 --> 00:29:10,860
By the way, Yamada likes young wrestlers very much

576
00:29:11,370 --> 00:29:13,370
I met her at a wrestling match

577
00:29:13,370 --> 00:29:15,140
She shouted at me

578
00:29:15,140 --> 00:29:19,050
Next time let's talk about handsome young wrestlers

579
00:29:19,050 --> 00:29:21,040
I was also cheeky and did not respond positively

580
00:29:23,140 --> 00:29:24,860
It's the same thing

581
00:29:24,860 --> 00:29:27,540
So we cant help but be more impervious to the troublesome

582
00:29:27,540 --> 00:29:32,250
Yeah, it's scary when you can't see what's coming.
-Yes

583
00:29:32,250 --> 00:29:34,970
Finally, regarding the collaboration

584
00:29:34,970 --> 00:29:37,730
It will really be uploaded to Kuni Channel after the show

585
00:29:37,730 --> 00:29:38,690
It should be viewed by many people

586
00:29:39,940 --> 00:29:43,120
Thankfully it ended well
-People will surely be curious

587
00:29:43,120 --> 00:29:45,090
If you are interested, please go and watch it!

588
00:29:45,090 --> 00:29:48,340
On the contrary, is there anyone who Kuniko would be reluctant to be invited by?

589
00:29:49,960 --> 00:29:50,820
The other way around

590
00:29:53,140 --> 00:29:56,370
Probably Bando Eiji-level

591
00:29:57,250 --> 00:29:59,720
I'm just giving you an example.
-Just an example

592
00:29:59,840 --> 00:30:02,810
It's just a completely off-topic example

593
00:30:02,810 --> 00:30:04,890
Not that off-topic

594
00:30:06,890 --> 00:30:09,260
Let's welcome the next presenter

595
00:30:15,630 --> 00:30:18,000
It's Koyabu

596
00:30:18,000 --> 00:30:19,570
Hello

597
00:30:19,570 --> 00:30:23,540
2m9
-Not 2m9, what are you talking about?

598
00:30:23,670 --> 00:30:25,940
Giant Baba 2 meters 9
-Who's Giant Baba?

599
00:30:25,940 --> 00:30:29,640
Please go and talk to Kuniko Yamada

600
00:30:29,640 --> 00:30:34,920
Turning to the topic, I ask you all encountered whoopee cushions before?

601
00:30:35,560 --> 00:30:40,340
1 or 2 times
-Many people played with them as kids

602
00:30:40,340 --> 00:30:44,550
Yeah, I did.
-The boys in my class took them to school

603
00:30:44,550 --> 00:30:46,200
You have, then

604
00:30:46,200 --> 00:30:51,270
Today I bring you a hypothesis related to whoopee cushions, take a look

605
00:30:51,930 --> 00:30:57,510
Can farting at the right time make the other person think they're being pranked with a whoopee cushion

606
00:30:57,510 --> 00:30:59,370
What does it mean?

607
00:31:00,050 --> 00:31:03,310
Will it work?
-Can the timing be that accurate?

608
00:31:03,310 --> 00:31:10,220
The setters wait in another room for their farts to brew before coming in

609
00:31:10,220 --> 00:31:11,690
When they're ready

610
00:31:11,690 --> 00:31:16,000
It's like a waiting room.
Indeed

611
00:31:16,000 --> 00:31:25,470
Can farting at the right time make the other person think they're being pranked with a whoopee cushion

612
00:31:23,510 --> 00:31:26,350
Who came up with that?
-Amazing!

613
00:31:26,170 --> 00:31:30,710
This time the participants are these four

614
00:31:26,350 --> 00:31:27,850
It's great

615
00:31:31,210 --> 00:31:33,310
Nice lineup.
-Yes

616
00:31:31,910 --> 00:31:34,240
Do you all fart?

617
00:31:34,380 --> 00:31:38,380
Release, but 80% of them are silent farts.
-My God!

618
00:31:38,650 --> 00:31:40,950
It has to be a loud fart, right?

619
00:31:41,080 --> 00:31:42,080
How is your physical condition today?

620
00:31:42,080 --> 00:31:44,920
All good

621
00:31:43,670 --> 00:31:45,010
What is a good state?

622
00:31:44,920 --> 00:31:49,160
I have a little... diarrhea

623
00:31:49,160 --> 00:31:52,660
With diarrhea the sound is a bit muffled

624
00:31:53,430 --> 00:31:55,100
The feeling
-Its not a fart sound anymore

625
00:31:55,530 --> 00:31:58,970
Not the sound of a fart?

626
00:31:59,230 --> 00:32:01,720
The target is...

627
00:32:02,570 --> 00:32:05,340
Hello

628
00:32:09,630 --> 00:32:13,940
He is called on the pretext of a prank special

629
00:32:15,200 --> 00:32:25,000
We explain a fake plan to make numerous comedians come in and sit unknowingly on a whoopee cushion

630
00:32:25,850 --> 00:32:29,240
So, 4 people are waiting in the other room

631
00:32:27,560 --> 00:32:29,870
What's Tsuda doing?
-What are you doing?

632
00:32:29,240 --> 00:32:34,430
The challenge will start with the first person to go to DJ KOO to fart

633
00:32:35,230 --> 00:32:39,760
If he doesn't realise the farts are real, the theory will be validated

634
00:32:39,760 --> 00:32:41,510
What'll happen?

635
00:32:41,510 --> 00:32:44,310
So, I'm going to use the fart pad to prank people

636
00:32:44,310 --> 00:32:45,850
Just the right amount

637
00:32:47,410 --> 00:32:53,380
DJ KOO, who knows nothing, happily sets up the cushion

638
00:32:53,840 --> 00:32:59,720
Then, the staff quietly replace it with a deflated farting pad

639
00:32:59,720 --> 00:33:02,440
The challenge begins

640
00:33:06,230 --> 00:33:08,900
Not at all.
-I can't. I can't get out at all

641
00:33:08,900 --> 00:33:11,170
Whoever is good, go ahead.
-Yeah, go ahead

642
00:33:11,410 --> 00:33:14,740
There's a lot of stuff. There's a lot of stuff

643
00:33:14,940 --> 00:33:18,610
Food to fart

644
00:33:14,940 --> 00:33:18,610
Soda, apples, bananas, hard-boiled eggs, baked sweet potatoes

645
00:33:15,190 --> 00:33:17,900
Is that a soda?
-Soda is good

646
00:33:18,840 --> 00:33:21,480
It feels like it's coming.
-Burp

647
00:33:22,520 --> 00:33:23,320
Burp

648
00:33:23,320 --> 00:33:25,890
It's a waste.
-How wasteful

649
00:33:26,090 --> 00:33:29,020
Farting is burping through the bottom

650
00:33:29,260 --> 00:33:31,860
Oh really

651
00:33:32,010 --> 00:33:33,180
Is that the truth?

652
00:33:32,360 --> 00:33:35,000
5 minutes have passed

653
00:33:42,070 --> 00:33:43,300
Wait

654
00:33:43,300 --> 00:33:44,070
What the hell?

655
00:33:44,070 --> 00:33:47,280
I thought it would come out a little bit and it came out

656
00:33:47,280 --> 00:33:49,440
No, you are too wasteful

657
00:33:49,440 --> 00:33:51,080
Wait, I don't feel like it's coming out.
-What's coming out?

658
00:33:51,080 --> 00:33:52,910
Really, I don't feel like it's coming out.
-What's coming out?

659
00:33:52,910 --> 00:33:54,780
I didn't feel like its coming out but i'll try

660
00:33:54,090 --> 00:33:55,990
What a sorry face

661
00:33:54,780 --> 00:33:56,420
I didn't expect the test would work

662
00:33:56,420 --> 00:33:59,750
It's a waste of time.
-I really thought it would not come out

663
00:34:00,380 --> 00:34:04,710
Tsuda goes off the rails right at the beginning

664
00:34:06,570 --> 00:34:07,440
Good sound

665
00:34:07,300 --> 00:34:09,800
Wait a minute, I really didn't think it would come out

666
00:34:09,800 --> 00:34:12,130
Don't push any harder.
-That was a good sound

667
00:34:12,130 --> 00:34:13,130
Just go in

668
00:34:13,130 --> 00:34:17,040
Hey, just now, that sound... its a little different than usual, i'm a little worried

669
00:34:17,040 --> 00:34:18,470
My ass doesn't feel right

670
00:34:18,470 --> 00:34:20,680
Like an old woman

671
00:34:20,680 --> 00:34:21,670
However

672
00:34:21,670 --> 00:34:22,540
Wait

673
00:34:22,540 --> 00:34:24,880
I'm almost there.
-Are you ready?

674
00:34:24,880 --> 00:34:25,710
Go

675
00:34:25,710 --> 00:34:28,080
I'm almost there

676
00:34:26,980 --> 00:34:29,380
How many times does he have to say it?

677
00:34:28,080 --> 00:34:31,950
Wait a minute, I can actually do it.
Wow, awesome

678
00:34:32,460 --> 00:34:37,680
When the other party realizes that it is not the sound of a whoopee cushion, the plan ends immediately

679
00:34:37,680 --> 00:34:39,430
What is the result?

680
00:34:41,160 --> 00:34:43,130
Hello

681
00:34:43,130 --> 00:34:45,170
Long time no see
-Long time no see

682
00:34:45,170 --> 00:34:46,430
How are you?
-Good

683
00:34:46,430 --> 00:34:47,500
Hello hello

684
00:34:47,500 --> 00:34:49,640
Wow, so happy!
Have a seat. - Have a seat

685
00:34:49,640 --> 00:34:50,940
Sorry

686
00:34:54,600 --> 00:34:55,730
So fast

687
00:34:55,730 --> 00:34:57,400
Butt hasn't touched the chair yet

688
00:35:00,660 --> 00:35:02,150
Hold back a little longer!

689
00:35:04,610 --> 00:35:05,890
What does the other side think?

690
00:35:05,890 --> 00:35:07,890
Successful?

691
00:35:11,480 --> 00:35:16,500
With the sound released, what was the result?

692
00:35:18,180 --> 00:35:19,940
It's hard

693
00:35:18,730 --> 00:35:20,470
What? What?

694
00:35:21,200 --> 00:35:22,530
Didn't realise?

695
00:35:21,270 --> 00:35:22,540
Hey, what... What?

696
00:35:22,700 --> 00:35:24,810
What's up with that?
-Hey, what...is...

697
00:35:24,810 --> 00:35:27,440
Did you just...

698
00:35:27,610 --> 00:35:30,980
You didn't expect it, right?

699
00:35:30,980 --> 00:35:33,010
Eh?

700
00:35:33,010 --> 00:35:34,360
A good person

701
00:35:33,950 --> 00:35:35,050
What's going on?

702
00:35:35,050 --> 00:35:37,220
As expected

703
00:35:38,220 --> 00:35:40,930
Didn't realise at all

704
00:35:41,790 --> 00:35:44,790
Great, not exposed at all
-Totally convinced

705
00:35:44,790 --> 00:35:47,730
Well covered

706
00:35:47,730 --> 00:35:53,000
Actually, it's a whoopee cushion. Sorry, sorry

707
00:35:53,000 --> 00:35:53,830
As expected

708
00:35:53,830 --> 00:35:58,040
But it's a small sound.
-You'd realise otherwise

709
00:35:58,040 --> 00:36:00,040
It's so real

710
00:36:00,040 --> 00:36:02,610
So real
-Make a bit more noise!

711
00:36:02,610 --> 00:36:04,750
But I heard it very clearly.
-Really?

712
00:36:05,600 --> 00:36:08,920
Great
-Great job!

713
00:36:08,920 --> 00:36:12,220
I was shocked that I could make such a small sound

714
00:36:12,220 --> 00:36:14,760
You did it before, right?
-Yes, yes, yes.

715
00:36:14,760 --> 00:36:16,490
Did you hear that?
-Absolutely

716
00:36:16,490 --> 00:36:17,660
Really?
-That's awesome

717
00:36:17,660 --> 00:36:18,860
Yes, yes, yes.
-Great!

718
00:36:19,060 --> 00:36:21,200
What does KOO think?

719
00:36:21,200 --> 00:36:23,630
The timing was just right

720
00:36:23,630 --> 00:36:27,600
Can we keep going?
-I think so

721
00:36:28,300 --> 00:36:29,270
So innocent

722
00:36:30,090 --> 00:36:33,470
So, the farting challenge continues

723
00:36:35,050 --> 00:36:38,380
I'll do this a little.
-That's a good position

724
00:36:38,380 --> 00:36:39,750
Let the air in

725
00:36:40,110 --> 00:36:42,110
That's good.
-It is

726
00:36:42,580 --> 00:36:44,440
Do apples also stimulate farts?

727
00:36:44,440 --> 00:36:47,780
By this point, 15 minutes had passed

728
00:36:50,930 --> 00:36:53,900
I think it's okay.
-Come on, come on, come on

729
00:36:53,900 --> 00:36:56,260
Sort of
-You do?

730
00:36:56,260 --> 00:36:58,500
Have you got it?
-Already... its already saying "hello"

731
00:36:58,500 --> 00:36:59,570
OKOKOK

732
00:36:59,570 --> 00:37:04,130
The 2nd place challenger is THE-MOMMY Sakai

733
00:37:07,740 --> 00:37:09,040
Long time no see

734
00:37:09,040 --> 00:37:09,810
It's been a long time since I saw KOO

735
00:37:09,810 --> 00:37:12,180
How are you doing?
-Thank you

736
00:37:12,180 --> 00:37:13,320
Not bad, not bad

737
00:37:13,320 --> 00:37:15,680
Thank you for your help on Youtube
-My pleasure

738
00:37:15,680 --> 00:37:17,220
Please sit. Please sit.
-I'll sit down then

739
00:37:17,220 --> 00:37:18,820
Please, have a seat

740
00:37:18,580 --> 00:37:20,580
So nervous

741
00:37:19,400 --> 00:37:20,580
What is the result?

742
00:37:20,580 --> 00:37:21,960
Find the right time

743
00:37:21,960 --> 00:37:25,480
I always see you on TV lately.
-No not really

744
00:37:25,480 --> 00:37:26,800
A big hit!

745
00:37:39,670 --> 00:37:40,770
Not out

746
00:37:41,810 --> 00:37:43,540
It didn't happen

747
00:37:44,380 --> 00:37:46,920
Are you okay? You won't be found out?

748
00:37:47,510 --> 00:37:50,470
Sakai has a painful realization

749
00:37:51,420 --> 00:37:53,690
Come back! Come back!
-Oh my God, he's going to find out

750
00:37:53,690 --> 00:37:54,920
It's revealed! It's revealed!

751
00:37:55,160 --> 00:37:57,390
We haven't been there yet

752
00:37:58,490 --> 00:38:01,660
Busy day, right? Are you shooting later?
-Yes

753
00:38:01,660 --> 00:38:03,800
Doing a small bit today, yes

754
00:38:04,330 --> 00:38:05,830
However, at this time

755
00:38:11,710 --> 00:38:13,040
What a fart

756
00:38:20,920 --> 00:38:28,290
Adjusting the sitting position, he finally squeezes out a small fart

757
00:38:29,340 --> 00:38:30,910
So

758
00:38:32,620 --> 00:38:34,730
Sakai
-Yes

759
00:38:34,730 --> 00:38:37,680
In fact, this is a prank

760
00:38:36,990 --> 00:38:43,370
KOO is very able
-Good choice

761
00:38:39,870 --> 00:38:42,670
I thought I something just happened...

762
00:38:42,670 --> 00:38:47,380
He's so excited, his face is so red

763
00:38:48,110 --> 00:38:51,680
We put a whoopee cushion under you

764
00:38:51,680 --> 00:38:53,310
Wow, really?

765
00:38:54,050 --> 00:38:56,280
This?
-Sorry, sorry

766
00:38:56,280 --> 00:39:00,120
Wow, I just heard a nice weak sound

767
00:39:00,120 --> 00:39:01,720
Maybe I missed it.
-Yes, it's true

768
00:39:01,920 --> 00:39:04,200
It's flattened.
-Yes

769
00:39:04,200 --> 00:39:08,030
So, there are two more challengers

770
00:39:08,030 --> 00:39:09,960
The situation is good now

771
00:39:10,570 --> 00:39:14,810
The sound of whoopee cushions and real farts

772
00:39:14,810 --> 00:39:18,450
Farts don't usually have that sound

773
00:39:18,450 --> 00:39:19,830
PAH! That sound

774
00:39:20,650 --> 00:39:21,720
That's true...
-Yes, yes

775
00:39:21,720 --> 00:39:22,560
It's true!

776
00:39:24,030 --> 00:39:27,260
At this point, the challenge has been going for 30 minutes

777
00:39:28,610 --> 00:39:33,720
However, Ogata and Nishimura have yet to release

778
00:39:35,090 --> 00:39:37,830
Can't you? Relax. Boom, boom, boom

779
00:39:37,830 --> 00:39:39,290
Such a crips sound

780
00:39:39,460 --> 00:39:40,660
Seriously

781
00:39:40,660 --> 00:39:42,230
What the hell

782
00:39:42,230 --> 00:39:43,770
What is there to envy about farting

783
00:39:43,800 --> 00:39:49,140
How nice to give him this sound
-It's so crisp, it's intoxicating

784
00:39:48,060 --> 00:39:49,080
Intoxicated my ass!

785
00:39:49,690 --> 00:39:53,910
And at this point, one hour has passed since the challenge

786
00:39:54,740 --> 00:39:59,080
I can't. People are waiting.
-No way

787
00:39:59,500 --> 00:40:02,620
And DJ KOO himself is...

788
00:40:06,850 --> 00:40:08,190
Gyaru!

789
00:40:09,930 --> 00:40:15,220
Doesn't care about the unexplained waiting time

790
00:40:15,660 --> 00:40:18,500
Let me think how to promote the fart for you
-Have a think

791
00:40:18,500 --> 00:40:20,970
Maybe a good ass-knocking.
-Got it.

792
00:40:20,970 --> 00:40:23,000
That's good, that's good

793
00:40:24,110 --> 00:40:26,030
Jump

794
00:40:27,940 --> 00:40:34,480
Under the guidance of Sakai, the senior farter, the two of them began to tap their bellies and hips

795
00:40:35,180 --> 00:40:37,490
I've got it.
-Here we go

796
00:40:37,490 --> 00:40:38,320
You need to be confident

797
00:40:38,320 --> 00:40:42,090
I'll go to the door and check again

798
00:40:42,090 --> 00:40:44,560
I'll come back if I can't.
-OK

799
00:40:44,560 --> 00:40:45,480
Go

800
00:40:51,000 --> 00:40:55,000
The sound is going into the room

801
00:40:56,640 --> 00:41:00,580
KOO heard you.
-Don't blow it

802
00:41:02,540 --> 00:41:06,410
KOO has a suspicious face

803
00:41:06,890 --> 00:41:08,120
At this point

804
00:41:10,370 --> 00:41:11,680
Hello

805
00:41:11,680 --> 00:41:14,440
It's been a long time. How are you?
-Very good

806
00:41:14,440 --> 00:41:16,140
Look a little tired, you okay?

807
00:41:19,230 --> 00:41:21,090
Look a little tired, you okay?

808
00:41:28,640 --> 00:41:30,910
What is this?
-Sorry

809
00:41:29,460 --> 00:41:31,270
What is this?

810
00:41:31,970 --> 00:41:33,350
Quite realistic

811
00:41:32,770 --> 00:41:36,610
Don't do it!
-Sorry!

812
00:41:33,350 --> 00:41:35,830
The expression afterwards, so realistic

813
00:41:35,830 --> 00:41:39,700
Can muddle through with acting skills

814
00:41:36,610 --> 00:41:39,010
It's out. It's out.
-Sweating profusely

815
00:41:41,450 --> 00:41:44,350
This is a prank

816
00:41:44,350 --> 00:41:47,220
Stop screwing around

817
00:41:46,200 --> 00:41:48,480
Is it that unpleasant?

818
00:41:48,260 --> 00:41:50,260
Great!

819
00:41:50,260 --> 00:41:52,860
Nice
-What a big sound!

820
00:41:52,860 --> 00:41:54,660
Loud enough?
-Loud!

821
00:41:54,660 --> 00:41:56,130
This is how it should be

822
00:41:56,370 --> 00:41:58,100
Next is Nishimura-san.
-It's hard to top

823
00:41:58,100 --> 00:42:00,710
It's up to you.
-I've gotta do it

824
00:42:00,940 --> 00:42:02,970
I'll go and prepare on the way

825
00:42:02,970 --> 00:42:05,510
I'm almost there

826
00:42:05,510 --> 00:42:06,640
No problem

827
00:42:06,640 --> 00:42:09,440
How long has it been?

828
00:42:09,440 --> 00:42:11,080
It's not over.
-2 hours

829
00:42:11,080 --> 00:42:13,210
It's amazing!

830
00:42:14,210 --> 00:42:20,840
Nishimura also came to the room and waited before rushing in as soon as he felt it

831
00:42:22,260 --> 00:42:23,320
At this time

832
00:42:28,360 --> 00:42:29,620
Looks kind of cool, what the hell?

833
00:42:29,210 --> 00:42:30,870
What is the result?

834
00:42:29,620 --> 00:42:30,810
Dashing

835
00:42:37,810 --> 00:42:40,210
Slipped back in

836
00:42:40,630 --> 00:42:44,820
After hitting himself for 5 minutes

837
00:42:53,230 --> 00:42:54,540
What happened?

838
00:43:01,320 --> 00:43:04,690
What the hell
-What the hell is going on in Viking?

839
00:43:02,760 --> 00:43:04,830
Weird!

840
00:43:04,830 --> 00:43:06,900
It went back

841
00:43:08,410 --> 00:43:12,460
After that, the tide of farts rises and falls

842
00:43:15,850 --> 00:43:18,510
Two steps and everything falls apart

843
00:43:20,850 --> 00:43:27,690
When I leave, it's gone. Can I just go in?
-Yes

844
00:43:34,160 --> 00:43:36,360
I'm exhausted, just finished shooting

845
00:43:36,360 --> 00:43:38,900
Ah, it's hard

846
00:43:39,530 --> 00:43:45,510
My back hurts. My back hurts.
-Sit slowly

847
00:43:45,770 --> 00:43:48,940
Too tired,I'm too stiff

848
00:43:48,940 --> 00:43:51,550
It's hard work.
-The waiting time is also long

849
00:43:51,550 --> 00:43:55,020
Take your time, take a breather

850
00:43:55,380 --> 00:43:59,420
Just too hard, my back is so stiff

851
00:44:00,940 --> 00:44:08,460
On one side is the eager DJ KOO, and on the other is the Nishimura who wont sit without the feeling

852
00:44:08,460 --> 00:44:09,840
An interesting offensive and defensive battle

853
00:44:09,560 --> 00:44:13,200
The waiting goes on for 5 minutes

854
00:44:14,290 --> 00:44:15,660
Finally

855
00:44:16,980 --> 00:44:19,290
You're more tired this way.
-No, not really

856
00:44:22,170 --> 00:44:23,430
There you go

857
00:44:32,640 --> 00:44:37,180
Nishimura released a beautiful 2-hit combo

858
00:44:40,590 --> 00:44:42,330
Good volume
-Lots of sound

859
00:44:42,330 --> 00:44:44,670
Good!
-So free!

860
00:44:44,670 --> 00:44:46,730
That's a lot.
-There are so many

861
00:44:48,320 --> 00:44:49,760
Sorry

862
00:44:50,840 --> 00:44:53,970
What what what?

863
00:44:53,970 --> 00:44:58,780
What's going on here?
-Great!

864
00:44:59,380 --> 00:45:02,120
You all waited for so long!

865
00:45:02,120 --> 00:45:04,520
Sorry, sorry to keep you waiting

866
00:45:06,910 --> 00:45:12,990
In summary
It took 2 hours and 18 minutes to confirm the theory

867
00:45:12,990 --> 00:45:16,280
Didn't realise

868
00:45:16,280 --> 00:45:18,230
The choice of KOO is a good one

869
00:45:18,230 --> 00:45:19,570
It's true, it's almost too obvious

870
00:45:19,570 --> 00:45:22,350
He's very innocent

871
00:45:22,350 --> 00:45:25,070
What does everyone think of this project

872
00:45:25,070 --> 00:45:26,500
Want to try it?

873
00:45:28,220 --> 00:45:29,180
That...

874
00:45:29,180 --> 00:45:31,310
There should be a female edition

875
00:45:31,310 --> 00:45:33,080
Women
-Female comedians

876
00:45:33,080 --> 00:45:37,290
Who would want to do this?

877
00:45:37,290 --> 00:45:38,690
Having so much fun

878
00:45:38,820 --> 00:45:42,850
Don't say it like "want to dance together?"

879
00:45:42,850 --> 00:46:14,780
