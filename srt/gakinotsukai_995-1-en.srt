What's with that smile?

18
00:00:17,680 --> 00:00:18,100
Can you wait until the train passes?

19
00:00:18,100 --> 00:00:19,330
Can you wait until the train passes?

20
00:00:19,340 --> 00:00:22,170
Can you wait until the train passes?

21
00:00:20,500 --> 00:00:23,420
For some reason, there's always a train at the start of our recordings

22
00:00:23,420 --> 00:00:25,770
There's no helping it then

23
00:00:23,920 --> 00:00:25,760
Sorry, there's nothing we can do

24
00:00:25,770 --> 00:00:27,460
27 stores is a hell of a challenge...

25
00:00:27,460 --> 00:00:28,660
Awesome!

26
00:00:28,700 --> 00:00:31,460
There's no way we could have finished all those dumplings

27
00:00:31,490 --> 00:00:33,810
Delicious~

33
00:00:36,400 --> 00:00:43,400
They each ate one piece of dumpling at each store, and they were about to reach the goal of 32 stores, however

34
00:00:42,460 --> 00:00:43,350
Oh shit

35
00:00:43,350 --> 00:00:46,570
It's not open

36
00:00:44,530 --> 00:00:50,120
When they reached the 29th store, it was already closed. All they could do was retire from the challenge

37
00:00:46,590 --> 00:00:50,160
Although close to finishing, the challenge ended abruptly

38
00:00:46,590 --> 00:00:50,160
Although close to finishing, the challenge ended abruptly

39
00:00:50,150 --> 00:00:54,930
This time, they will take on the challenge of eating at Gindako's stores in 23 Districts of Tokyo

40
00:00:54,430 --> 00:00:57,630
37 Stores over 23 Districts in Tokyo

Total Domination Challenge

44
00:00:55,120 --> 00:01:01,150
At each of the 37 stores, the 5 of them will aim to eat up an 8 pack of Octopus balls

45
00:00:57,650 --> 00:01:01,570
The 5 of them will eat up an 8 pack of Octopus balls at each store

46
00:00:57,650 --> 00:01:12,380
<RULES>

47
00:01:01,370 --> 00:01:06,400
Each person must eat at least one, the remaining 3 can be split either way

48
00:01:01,570 --> 00:01:07,570
Each person must eat one,

49
00:01:01,570 --> 00:01:07,570
The remaining 3 are free to be eaten by anyone

50
00:01:07,500 --> 00:01:12,380
If they complete the challenge, there will be a million yen prize

51
00:01:07,580 --> 00:01:12,380
The prize for completing all 37 stores is 1 million yen!

52
00:01:12,380 --> 00:01:16,940
However, in the event that someone retires, the challenge ends there,

53
00:01:15,540 --> 00:01:21,650
<RULES>

54
00:01:15,550 --> 00:01:21,650
And the person who retired has to pay for all of the accumulated bill

55
00:01:15,550 --> 00:01:21,650
If any one of them retires, the challenge is over!

56
00:01:16,920 --> 00:01:21,650
and the person who retired will have to pay for all of the accumulated bill by himself

57
00:01:22,860 --> 00:01:23,600
What's up?

58
00:01:23,660 --> 00:01:24,960
You barely ate any dumplings

59
00:01:25,000 --> 00:01:27,470
I ate so many dumplings

60
00:01:26,200 --> 00:01:27,460
No you didn't

61
00:01:27,500 --> 00:01:31,160
The guys from the shop were all shocked I ate so much

62
00:01:31,230 --> 00:01:32,730
You barely ate any at all

63
00:01:32,760 --> 00:01:35,560
They edited that part, to maintain my image...

64
00:01:35,630 --> 00:01:37,790
They were shocked at how little you ate!

65
00:01:38,260 --> 00:01:40,760
If I remember correctly

66
00:01:39,480 --> 00:01:40,010
I fucking love  takoyaki though!

67
00:01:40,010 --> 00:01:40,410
I fucking love takoyaki though!

68
00:01:40,410 --> 00:01:42,410
I fucking love takoyaki though!

69
00:01:40,900 --> 00:01:43,120
He's said it! You better eat loads then!

70
00:01:42,430 --> 00:01:45,780
Because my own grandfather

71
00:01:43,130 --> 00:01:45,780
used to run an octopus ball store

72
00:01:46,200 --> 00:01:48,430
It's true, I'm telling you all

73
00:01:48,500 --> 00:01:51,130
You know this, right? My father used to sell octopus balls

74
00:01:51,200 --> 00:01:53,060
Octopus ball store?

75
00:01:53,130 --> 00:01:54,880
This is the first time I've heard of this

76
00:01:55,490 --> 00:01:56,190
He died so hard though!

77
00:01:56,190 --> 00:02:01,390
He died so hard though!

78
00:02:02,420 --> 00:02:05,670
I'm a little confused

79
00:02:03,520 --> 00:02:05,670
with this costume we're wearing

80
00:02:06,990 --> 00:02:10,070
When I asked the staff

81
00:02:08,720 --> 00:02:10,070
"What's with the get-up?"

82
00:02:10,070 --> 00:02:10,610
They said "We're mocking Osaka"

83
00:02:10,630 --> 00:02:14,000
They said "We're mocking Osaka"

84
00:02:14,000 --> 00:02:15,690
This is taking the piss out of Osaka?

85
00:02:15,690 --> 00:02:17,270
This is their image of taking the piss out of Osaka?..

86
00:02:17,270 --> 00:02:20,000
They said it right to my face "We're taking the piss out of Osaka"

87
00:02:20,000 --> 00:02:22,000
That's messed up

88
00:02:20,000 --> 00:02:22,000
That's really nasty

89
00:02:22,000 --> 00:02:24,240
Yeah, what's that all about?

90
00:02:26,810 --> 00:02:30,360
Because the stores are opening

91
00:02:27,810 --> 00:02:30,360
Because the stores are opening

92
00:02:30,400 --> 00:02:32,780
Let's start right now. Ready?

93
00:02:32,780 --> 00:02:33,410

110
00:02:46,510 --> 00:02:49,210
I've only eaten one rice ball

111
00:02:47,860 --> 00:02:49,230
You already ate?

112
00:02:49,210 --> 00:02:49,980
Why the hell did you eat rice balls!

113
00:02:49,980 --> 00:02:52,320
Why the hell did you eat rice balls!

114
00:02:50,000 --> 00:02:52,310
It was only one

115
00:02:52,310 --> 00:02:54,700
Why'd you have to go and eat something?

116
00:02:54,700 --> 00:02:57,000
Haven't you guys eaten anything?

117
00:02:57,010 --> 00:03:01,100
It's no good starting on an empty stomach, so I thought that if I had a rice ball, I'll feel better

118
00:03:02,290 --> 00:03:07,270
1st Store Shinbashi Store

00:03:33,460 --> 00:03:37,130
You all must be starving

137
00:03:35,740 --> 00:03:37,140
I'm so hungry

138
00:03:37,140 --> 00:03:40,170
If you're that hungry, you probably want 2 or 3 pieces, right?

139
00:03:39,150 --> 00:03:40,160
I would...

140
00:03:40,160 --> 00:03:42,770
You've been saying that for ages

141
00:03:41,300 --> 00:03:42,770
Excuse me, the food's arrived

142
00:03:43,820 --> 00:03:47,210
Can we decide who will eat how many?

143
00:03:45,710 --> 00:03:47,220
Yes, that's fine

144
00:03:47,210 --> 00:03:49,300
So who's gonna eat how many?

145
00:03:48,070 --> 00:03:49,310
Just start eating first

146
00:03:49,310 --> 00:03:53,500
Anyway, we each have to have one piece

147
00:03:53,500 --> 00:03:58,330
It's really is huge. Let's eat.

148
00:03:57,500 --> 00:03:58,330
Ittadakimasu!

149
00:03:58,390 --> 00:04:00,500
Wow, you can eat it in one go, huh?

150
00:04:00,500 --> 00:04:02,250
This is really good

151
00:04:02,250 --> 00:04:04,790
That's because this is the first store

152
00:04:03,250 --> 00:04:04,790
It's real good

153
00:04:04,350 --> 00:04:06,100
Soooo good

154
00:04:05,000 --> 00:04:06,100
It's delicious

155
00:04:06,360 --> 00:04:07,730
It's very delicious

156
00:04:07,730 --> 00:04:09,230
Is it really?

157
00:04:09,510 --> 00:04:11,510
Really feels like we can win this one

158
00:04:10,080 --> 00:04:14,040
You all probably feel like eating more because you are all starving

159
00:04:14,040 --> 00:04:16,040
For now at least

160
00:04:16,630 --> 00:04:18,640
Matsumoto

161
00:04:16,630 --> 00:04:18,640
Matsumoto

162
00:04:16,630 --> 00:04:18,640
Matsumoto

163
00:04:16,630 --> 00:04:18,640
Matsumoto

164
00:04:20,860 --> 00:04:23,260
I mean, I can do it...

165
00:04:24,640 --> 00:04:25,490
We're starting with tricks already

166
00:04:25,510 --> 00:04:29,740
It's not

167
00:04:26,000 --> 00:04:26,540
that kind of game, right!?

168
00:04:26,540 --> 00:04:29,740
that kind of game, right!?

169
00:04:28,340 --> 00:04:33,110
We know that but everyone is finding it easy at this point

170
00:04:33,110 --> 00:04:38,200
Sure, then I'll have 2 pieces but, how about the rest?

171
00:04:39,310 --> 00:04:43,140
We're at the first place, how did it suddenly

172
00:04:39,310 --> 00:04:43,140
become this situation?

173
00:04:41,940 --> 00:04:44,500
I know, that was quick

174
00:04:44,500 --> 00:04:46,500
Fine fine fine

175
00:04:45,610 --> 00:04:47,960
I'll eat one then

176
00:04:46,240 --> 00:04:47,430
It's the Downtown Duo

177
00:04:47,430 --> 00:04:49,240
Oh both of Downtown...

178
00:04:48,080 --> 00:04:49,770
Someone else can have the last one

179
00:04:49,540 --> 00:04:51,780
You look like you want it

180
00:04:51,050 --> 00:04:53,780
You look terrified, why are you so scared?

181
00:04:52,000 --> 00:04:54,000
What are you afraid of?

182
00:04:54,000 --> 00:04:56,000
I would but,

183
00:04:54,860 --> 00:04:55,270
It was bigger than I thought

184
00:04:55,270 --> 00:04:57,770
It was bigger than I thought

185
00:04:56,320 --> 00:04:58,370
Just eat it, Yama-chan

186
00:04:58,390 --> 00:05:00,500
I'll take it because it's the first place.

187
00:04:58,390 --> 00:05:04,000
The youngest should stay hungry for later on

188
00:05:05,840 --> 00:05:06,650
You say 'young' but, he's 38 years old

189
00:05:06,650 --> 00:05:09,810
You say 'young' but, he's 38 years old

190
00:05:08,270 --> 00:05:10,040
Relative to me, of course

191
00:05:10,040 --> 00:05:13,580
Complete

192
00:05:10,580 --> 00:05:12,580
Okay, all done

193
00:05:12,580 --> 00:05:14,700
Easy...

194
00:05:14,700 --> 00:05:16,700
We've got a schedule to keep, so let's move on to the next store

195
00:05:19,430 --> 00:05:20,730
We're just going to overlook the fact

196
00:05:20,730 --> 00:05:24,460
That he swept bonito onto the floor

197
00:05:24,460 --> 00:05:28,750
So this is what having 2 pieces feels like

198
00:05:24,490 --> 00:05:28,900
1st Store

199
00:05:24,490 --> 00:05:28,900
1st Store

200
00:05:24,490 --> 00:05:28,900
2nd Store

201
00:05:24,490 --> 00:05:28,900
2nd Store

202
00:05:24,490 --> 00:05:28,900
Ginza HQ

203
00:05:24,490 --> 00:05:28,900
Shinbashi Store

204
00:05:28,900 --> 00:05:31,440
Well, since this challenge will take a while

205
00:05:31,910 --> 00:05:33,630
There will be time to digest

206
00:05:33,630 --> 00:05:35,630
I see

207
00:05:36,160 --> 00:05:40,990
My father

208
00:05:37,200 --> 00:05:40,990
made smaller octopus balls

209
00:05:38,330 --> 00:05:42,100
Yea, they're usually smaller in Osaka, also the fried style is uncommon

210
00:05:42,100 --> 00:05:43,850
Yea, no fried ones

211
00:05:43,910 --> 00:05:47,120
During my time

212
00:05:43,910 --> 00:05:47,120
It was 10 Yen per piece

213
00:05:45,500 --> 00:05:47,120
Yea, it was

214
00:05:47,120 --> 00:05:51,120
It's the headquarters, right?

215
00:05:48,690 --> 00:05:51,120
Yea, Gindako's headquarters

216
00:05:51,500 --> 00:05:56,360
GINdako?

217
00:05:51,500 --> 00:05:56,360
Oh that's why it's called

218
00:05:54,160 --> 00:05:55,560
The "gin" in Ginza, you mean

219
00:05:55,700 --> 00:05:57,280
It could be

220
00:05:57,330 --> 00:05:57,740
Ask them later, Tanaka

221
00:05:57,740 --> 00:05:58,200
Ask them later, Tanaka

222
00:05:58,200 --> 00:05:59,800
Ask them later, Tanaka

223
00:05:58,200 --> 00:05:59,800
Sure thing

224
00:05:59,800 --> 00:06:00,110
Why can't you just ask them yourself

225
00:06:00,110 --> 00:06:00,470
Why can't you just ask them yourself

226
00:06:00,470 --> 00:06:03,630
Why can't you just ask them yourself

227
00:06:01,390 --> 00:06:04,300
It's probably not so embarrassing for him

228
00:06:04,300 --> 00:06:06,200
I don't think that question will anger them

229
00:06:06,200 --> 00:06:09,030
We're here, let's go

230
00:06:06,210 --> 00:06:10,920
Store no. 2 Ginza HQ

231
00:06:10,920 --> 00:07:35,800
Store no. 2 Ginza HQ

232
00:06:15,000 --> 00:06:18,000
Ginza headquarters

233
00:06:18,000 --> 00:06:20,250
This is my first time here

234
00:06:22,250 --> 00:06:25,250
Wow, it's huge, isn't it?

235
00:06:25,250 --> 00:06:27,250
It really has a headquarters feel to it

236
00:06:26,060 --> 00:06:27,250
It's really well built

237
00:06:27,800 --> 00:06:30,500
This is so cool

238
00:06:30,500 --> 00:06:31,820
It's awesome

239
00:06:31,850 --> 00:06:32,820
Let's have this one here

240
00:06:32,740 --> 00:06:38,460
Spring Onion Ball

241
00:06:32,820 --> 00:06:34,390
Spring Onion Ball

242
00:06:36,390 --> 00:06:37,890
Thank you very much

243
00:06:38,460 --> 00:06:42,460
We're going up to the 2nd floor

244
00:06:43,430 --> 00:06:47,910
We must strive to achieve the goal, guys

245
00:06:48,270 --> 00:06:48,750
Didn't you have something you wanted to ask?

246
00:06:48,750 --> 00:06:50,780
Didn't you have something you wanted to ask?

247
00:06:50,340 --> 00:06:52,090
That's right

248
00:06:50,810 --> 00:06:52,050
Oh right, about the headquarters

249
00:06:52,090 --> 00:06:54,050
The "Gin" in Gindako

250
00:06:54,840 --> 00:06:55,460
Why didn't you ask them? What the hell!

251
00:06:55,460 --> 00:06:58,260
Why didn't you ask them? What the hell!

252
00:06:58,260 --> 00:07:02,260
Is it good?

253
00:06:58,300 --> 00:07:06,160
similar to the one in Ginza

254
00:06:58,300 --> 00:07:06,160
The Origin of Tsukiji Gindako

255
00:06:58,300 --> 00:07:06,160
Tsukiji Gindako hopes to have a store

256
00:07:03,010 --> 00:07:04,130
Let's have one each first

257
00:07:04,130 --> 00:07:07,520
With this flavour, the last piece is probably the best tasting one

258
00:07:06,300 --> 00:07:10,280
Spring Onion Ball

259
00:07:07,520 --> 00:07:10,270
That's because it doesn't sit heavily

260
00:07:10,820 --> 00:07:12,820
It's quite easy to get it down

261
00:07:13,030 --> 00:07:14,610
What about these 3 pieces?

262
00:07:14,630 --> 00:07:17,600
If we go in order

263
00:07:15,300 --> 00:07:17,600
then Tanaka and myself haven't eaten yet

264
00:07:16,000 --> 00:07:17,600
Yea, we haven't had our share

265
00:07:17,600 --> 00:07:19,600
So we'll each have one

266
00:07:19,160 --> 00:07:20,450
Yamazaki have one

267
00:07:21,580 --> 00:07:24,600
I can still go for sure

268
00:07:24,670 --> 00:07:28,750
Have you

269
00:07:25,070 --> 00:07:25,590
been planning for that?

270
00:07:25,590 --> 00:07:28,750
been planning for that?

271
00:07:28,750 --> 00:07:31,250
That's no good, stop that

272
00:07:31,250 --> 00:07:35,800
Complete

273
00:07:31,460 --> 00:07:33,250
Thanks for the meal

274
00:07:31,460 --> 00:07:33,250
Thanks for the meal

275
00:07:31,460 --> 00:07:33,250
Thanks for the meal

276
00:07:33,480 --> 00:07:35,820
Okay, let's move on to the next store

277
00:07:35,800 --> 00:07:44,780
2nd Store

278
00:07:35,800 --> 00:07:44,780
2nd Store

279
00:07:35,800 --> 00:07:44,780
3rd Store

280
00:07:35,800 --> 00:07:44,780
3rd Store

281
00:07:35,800 --> 00:07:44,780
Ginza HQ

282
00:07:35,800 --> 00:07:44,780
Ningyocho Store

283
00:07:35,820 --> 00:07:37,820
We finish so quickly

284
00:07:38,200 --> 00:07:42,330
Since we finish so fast wouldn't it better to bring the octopus balls to us instead?

285
00:07:42,330 --> 00:07:44,330
Yea, I agree

286
00:07:45,060 --> 00:07:48,310
(Menu) Want to pick the next one first?

287
00:07:46,180 --> 00:07:48,890
Okay, let's have a look then

288
00:07:48,890 --> 00:07:51,610
We're having Teriyaki w/ Egg Ball next, aren't we?

289
00:07:50,780 --> 00:07:57,220
Teriyaki w/ Egg Ball

290
00:07:51,610 --> 00:07:53,110
Shall we try Teriyaki w/ Egg Ball next?

291
00:07:53,110 --> 00:07:55,110
Teriyaki w/ Egg Ball

292
00:07:57,690 --> 00:08:00,990
40 pieces means... 1 pack each

293
00:08:00,990 --> 00:08:02,780
Johnny Depp?

294
00:08:02,780 --> 00:08:49,870
AD Tsuruta (Age 25)

295
00:08:02,780 --> 00:08:49,870
Gaki no Tsukai's

296
00:08:02,780 --> 00:08:49,870
Johnny Depp

297
00:08:03,660 --> 00:08:08,830
He gave up after 10 pieces

298
00:08:03,680 --> 00:08:08,830
(During the simulation)

299
00:08:04,160 --> 00:08:05,660
10 is quite a lot, isn't it

300
00:08:06,000 --> 00:08:08,000
He's so bad, giving up after eating only 10 pieces

301
00:08:08,000 --> 00:08:09,500
10 is quite little, isn't it

302
00:08:09,500 --> 00:08:11,500
He's not good at eating

303
00:08:11,620 --> 00:08:13,160
Because he's old

304
00:08:13,190 --> 00:08:14,400
What, he's still so young

305
00:08:14,400 --> 00:08:18,940
We're like the same age...

306
00:08:18,940 --> 00:08:22,240
Gaki no Tsukai's

307
00:08:18,940 --> 00:08:22,240
We're talking about Johnny Depp

308
00:08:20,240 --> 00:08:22,240
Oh, you guys were talking about Johnny Depp

309
00:08:23,780 --> 00:08:24,150
Huh? Wait, what

310
00:08:24,150 --> 00:08:27,980
Huh? Wait, what

311
00:08:24,520 --> 00:08:27,980
aren't we the same age?

312
00:08:27,980 --> 00:08:30,110
What is?

313
00:08:30,140 --> 00:08:32,480
He's like 40 something, right?

314
00:08:31,000 --> 00:08:34,780
Yes, the real Johnny Depp is...

315
00:08:34,980 --> 00:08:36,580
We're not talking about that Johnny Depp

316
00:08:36,880 --> 00:08:39,520
Oh, aren't you?

317
00:08:39,060 --> 00:08:40,630
You had no idea?

318
00:08:43,240 --> 00:08:46,600
You think Johnny Depp

319
00:08:43,970 --> 00:08:44,540
ate Gindako octopus balls?

320
00:08:44,540 --> 00:08:46,600
ate Gindako octopus balls?

321
00:08:46,600 --> 00:08:49,870
When he came to Japan

322
00:08:47,320 --> 00:08:49,870
He could have tried some

323
00:08:50,470 --> 00:08:55,200
You're senility is really starting to be scary

324
00:08:55,200 --> 00:08:59,000
He's been saying that a lot recently

325
00:08:59,030 --> 00:09:02,780
Last time he said something similar as well

326
00:09:02,780 --> 00:09:04,760
It was a quiz

327
00:09:04,760 --> 00:09:11,260
It was a quiz

328
00:09:05,670 --> 00:09:05,990
But he went and gave out the answer

329
00:09:05,990 --> 00:09:11,260
But he went and gave out the answer

330
00:09:07,200 --> 00:09:11,260
Whilst saying the question?..

331
00:09:11,260 --> 00:09:13,260
We've arrived! Let's go

332
00:09:11,300 --> 00:09:18,200
3rd Store Ningyocho Store

333
00:09:13,260 --> 00:09:15,260
Again? It's too soon

334
00:09:18,200 --> 00:09:21,200
We're only up to the 3rd store

335
00:09:18,200 --> 00:10:49,490
3rd Store Ningyocho Store

336
00:09:21,200 --> 00:09:24,320
Come on. This will be easy

337
00:09:24,320 --> 00:09:26,320
This one's made of wood too

338
00:09:26,320 --> 00:09:30,810
Hello, good afternoon

339
00:09:30,810 --> 00:09:32,810
Can we get it to go?

340
00:09:30,810 --> 00:09:32,810
Teriyaki w/ Egg please

341
00:09:34,010 --> 00:09:36,810
Thank you very much~

342
00:09:38,590 --> 00:09:42,720
1 Pack 600 Yen

343
00:09:38,590 --> 00:09:42,720
Teriyaki Sauce w/ Egg & Mayonnaise

344
00:09:38,710 --> 00:09:42,720
They've put too much teriyaki sauce

345
00:09:42,720 --> 00:09:46,540
The youngest person should have the one with the most toppings

346
00:09:47,700 --> 00:09:48,760
Yea, I'd say so too

347
00:09:48,880 --> 00:09:50,140
That one over there

348
00:09:50,140 --> 00:09:51,060
As the youngest I'll have it

349
00:09:51,060 --> 00:09:53,060
Is it good?

350
00:09:56,780 --> 00:09:59,380
Have another

351
00:09:59,380 --> 00:10:01,950
Okay, I will

352
00:10:00,480 --> 00:10:02,110
There are still 3 pieces

353
00:10:01,970 --> 00:10:04,990
He's going for it

354
00:10:05,580 --> 00:10:07,990
He's seriously going for it

355
00:10:08,870 --> 00:10:11,780
Downtown Duo, could you stop

356
00:10:08,870 --> 00:10:11,780
putting down your chopsticks so quickly?

357
00:10:11,050 --> 00:10:13,350
It's not over yet

358
00:10:13,350 --> 00:10:15,980
Yea, could you stop putting them down so fast?

359
00:10:15,980 --> 00:10:17,960
At least hold on to them

360
00:10:15,980 --> 00:10:17,960
Hold on to them please

361
00:10:18,180 --> 00:10:20,490
I want to eat it too much

362
00:10:20,490 --> 00:10:22,150
You can have another

363
00:10:22,150 --> 00:10:24,930
I'm holding back. I don't want to seem selfish.

364
00:10:24,930 --> 00:10:27,440
Please please, here Hamada have one

365
00:10:27,440 --> 00:10:28,690
Well if Yama-chan says so

366
00:10:28,690 --> 00:10:30,060
Enjoy, Downtown Duo

367
00:10:30,720 --> 00:10:32,050
Oh, what?

368
00:10:32,050 --> 00:10:34,050
Don't transfer your topping over

369
00:10:35,850 --> 00:10:40,320
Did you guys see that? He's trying to put more on mine

370
00:10:37,520 --> 00:10:38,610
It doesn't matter

371
00:10:41,160 --> 00:10:43,330
He dumped his all onto Hamada's

372
00:10:45,000 --> 00:10:48,670
All done. We've finished up here

373
00:10:45,810 --> 00:10:49,490
Complete

374
00:10:49,490 --> 00:10:53,490
On to the next store. Thank you very much

375
00:10:49,530 --> 00:10:55,400
3rd Store

376
00:10:49,530 --> 00:10:55,400

377
00:10:49,530 --> 00:10:55,400
4th Store

378
00:10:49,530 --> 00:10:55,400
4th Store

379
00:10:49,530 --> 00:10:55,400
LaQua Store

380
00:10:49,530 --> 00:10:55,400
Ningyocho Store

381
00:10:57,330 --> 00:10:58,440
We've just barely started

382
00:10:58,440 --> 00:11:00,440
Tanaka's not even trying

383
00:11:02,400 --> 00:11:05,810
Wait wait, hold on. Don't say that

384
00:11:05,810 --> 00:11:06,850
But it's written down right here

385
00:11:06,850 --> 00:11:09,920
I'll be depressed if you say that

386
00:11:09,920 --> 00:11:11,980
It's only Tanaka

387
00:11:11,990 --> 00:11:12,650
Just like a Gravure Idol

388
00:11:12,650 --> 00:11:16,080
Just like a Gravure Idol

389
00:11:16,080 --> 00:11:17,580
Only 4 pieces is no good

390
00:11:18,140 --> 00:11:18,890
I don't think having 5 pieces

391
00:11:18,890 --> 00:11:22,820
I don't think having 5 pieces

392
00:11:19,770 --> 00:11:22,820
Come on! It's just 1 piece

393
00:11:19,770 --> 00:11:22,820
would make you a man

394
00:11:22,820 --> 00:11:25,010
We're here! Let's go!

395
00:11:22,830 --> 00:11:31,000
Store no. 4 LaQua Store

396
00:11:26,010 --> 00:11:29,010
Good afternoon~

397
00:11:29,010 --> 00:11:30,060
Excuse us

398
00:11:30,060 --> 00:11:31,500
It's not what we had in mind

399
00:11:31,000 --> 00:12:47,010
Store no. 4 LaQua Store

400
00:11:31,510 --> 00:11:32,970
Yea, this store's different

401
00:11:32,870 --> 00:11:41,150
Cheese Mentaiko

402
00:11:33,500 --> 00:11:35,910
The cheese one

403
00:11:33,960 --> 00:11:35,910
It was surprising

404
00:11:35,910 --> 00:11:38,060
Yes, Cheese Mentaiko

405
00:11:38,060 --> 00:11:39,630
Thanks

406
00:11:41,140 --> 00:11:41,580
The octopus bits are quite huge

407
00:11:41,580 --> 00:11:42,250
The octopus bits are quite huge

408
00:11:42,250 --> 00:11:45,840
The octopus bits are quite huge

409
00:11:43,490 --> 00:11:45,840
They're huge, aren't they?

410
00:11:45,840 --> 00:11:47,840
Food's ready

411
00:11:47,840 --> 00:11:49,840
Please have a seat

412
00:11:52,410 --> 00:11:53,990
Let's dig in

413
00:11:55,380 --> 00:11:56,950
One piece each

414
00:11:56,950 --> 00:11:58,950
Bon appetit

415
00:11:56,950 --> 00:11:58,950
Time to try Cheese Mentaiko

416
00:11:59,200 --> 00:12:00,500
It's hot

417
00:12:01,500 --> 00:12:03,950
How is it? Is the flavor good?

418
00:12:03,900 --> 00:12:05,350
A little hot though

419
00:12:03,900 --> 00:12:05,350
It's quite hot

420
00:12:08,460 --> 00:12:10,000
Tanaka, have another

421
00:12:10,000 --> 00:12:12,400
That's trying the least

422
00:12:10,000 --> 00:12:12,400
You're the one

423
00:12:12,400 --> 00:12:15,010
If you say that to me, I will go for it then

424
00:12:17,790 --> 00:12:20,000
It was so bloody hot

425
00:12:20,420 --> 00:12:22,690
Endo's going for a second piece

426
00:12:24,220 --> 00:12:25,940
The youngest person should have the last piece

427
00:12:27,010 --> 00:12:27,890
Yama-chan

428
00:12:27,890 --> 00:12:29,210
Oh right right

429
00:12:29,210 --> 00:12:30,970
Here, I'm just going to rest...

430
00:12:31,540 --> 00:12:33,120
I think it's better

431
00:12:33,120 --> 00:12:35,340
if I allow Yama-chan to get on TV a bit

432
00:12:35,340 --> 00:12:38,020
Even though it's the tastiest one...

433
00:12:38,020 --> 00:12:40,020
But he's dropping it all

434
00:12:42,020 --> 00:12:43,280
Are you guys all done?

435
00:12:42,290 --> 00:12:47,000
Complete

436
00:12:43,300 --> 00:12:44,370
This one was quite easy

437
00:12:44,370 --> 00:12:47,000
Okay, let's move on to the next one

438
00:12:47,010 --> 00:12:49,650
Shall we go for the Original or the spring Onion one next?

439
00:12:47,010 --> 00:12:51,820
4th Store

440
00:12:47,010 --> 00:12:51,820
4th Store

441
00:12:47,010 --> 00:12:51,820
5th Store

442
00:12:47,010 --> 00:12:51,820
5th Store

443
00:12:47,010 --> 00:12:51,820
LaQua Store

444
00:12:47,010 --> 00:12:51,820
Yoshiike Okachimachi Store

445
00:12:50,800 --> 00:12:52,060
Have we gone through the list already?

446
00:12:52,190 --> 00:12:54,010
Look at Endo and I

447
00:12:53,000 --> 00:12:56,230
Well, it's because we're the youngest

448
00:12:56,010 --> 00:12:58,010
We can eat as much as we want

449
00:12:59,690 --> 00:13:01,990
None of you have even eaten 1 pack's worth

450
00:13:03,000 --> 00:13:05,690
Up till now...

451
00:13:06,110 --> 00:13:07,030
No one's gone

452
00:13:07,030 --> 00:13:11,580
No one's gone

453
00:13:07,980 --> 00:13:11,580
"I'll have the other 3 pieces"

454
00:13:09,400 --> 00:13:11,000
I guess so

455
00:13:09,400 --> 00:13:11,000
Yea, that's true

456
00:13:11,660 --> 00:13:13,460
It's fine if someone wants to

457
00:13:14,260 --> 00:13:15,610
But if someone does

458
00:13:15,610 --> 00:13:19,440
It's not out of the question since

459
00:13:17,060 --> 00:13:19,440
It's not out of the question since

460
00:13:19,430 --> 00:13:21,030
I see, it'll help

461
00:13:19,460 --> 00:13:22,770
It helps the digestion process

462
00:13:21,440 --> 00:13:22,770
Right, I get it

463
00:13:22,770 --> 00:13:27,180
We wouldn't know but, each of our bodies digest at its own pace

464
00:13:28,770 --> 00:13:32,620
So you're saying that

465
00:13:30,290 --> 00:13:30,820
Tanaka should eat 4 pieces next

466
00:13:30,820 --> 00:13:32,620
Tanaka should eat 4 pieces next

467
00:13:31,480 --> 00:13:32,620
You really haven't eaten enough

468
00:13:32,620 --> 00:13:37,390
"It's Tanaka's turn to eat 4 pieces"

469
00:13:36,010 --> 00:13:37,350
Hold on a bit

470
00:13:37,350 --> 00:13:39,350
With that Tanaka will be up to 10 pieces

471
00:13:39,350 --> 00:13:41,350
That's quite true

472
00:13:41,350 --> 00:13:43,800
That's right, you should give it a try

473
00:13:43,800 --> 00:13:45,660
Then we'll see how he feels after

474
00:13:45,660 --> 00:13:46,670
Tanaka goes first, then Endo goes

475
00:13:46,670 --> 00:13:49,670
Tanaka goes first, then Endo goes

476
00:13:49,670 --> 00:13:54,070
I wonder then,

477
00:13:50,620 --> 00:13:54,070
during that, will you guys have time to digest?

478
00:13:52,230 --> 00:13:54,650
One person slowly eats one by one

479
00:13:54,650 --> 00:13:57,930
It's worth to try that to see how effective it'll be

480
00:13:57,980 --> 00:14:00,130
While the other 4 of us wait around

481
00:13:58,930 --> 00:14:01,010
While the rest of you wait around

482
00:14:02,330 --> 00:14:04,180
I get it now

483
00:14:04,610 --> 00:14:06,520
What number store are we up to now?

484
00:14:06,520 --> 00:14:10,050
It's the 4th

485
00:14:08,630 --> 00:14:10,300
We only up to the 4th store

486
00:14:10,290 --> 00:14:12,050
That's so bad...

487
00:14:13,180 --> 00:14:14,740
It's still a long way away

488
00:14:15,100 --> 00:14:16,910
It's only the 4th store, but you're already frustrated

489
00:14:18,520 --> 00:14:20,700
37 (stores)

490
00:14:18,520 --> 00:14:20,700
is rather many isn't it

491
00:14:20,700 --> 00:14:21,140
Frankly speaking, with 23 districts

492
00:14:21,140 --> 00:14:27,500
Frankly speaking, with 23 districts

493
00:14:22,620 --> 00:14:23,140
eating at 1 store for each district should be fine

494
00:14:23,140 --> 00:14:24,080
eating at 1 store for each district should be fine

495
00:14:24,080 --> 00:14:27,500
eating at 1 store for each district should be fine

496
00:14:26,090 --> 00:14:27,500
What do you mean "should be fine"?

497
00:14:27,500 --> 00:14:33,940
He's spouting out some

498
00:14:28,800 --> 00:14:33,940
business strategies now

499
00:14:31,450 --> 00:14:33,940
That's Gindako's job so...

500
00:14:34,330 --> 00:14:35,400
Octopus balls~~~

501
00:14:34,390 --> 00:14:41,690
5th Store Yoshiike Okachimachi Store

502
00:14:35,400 --> 00:14:38,050
There it is, I see it

503
00:14:38,050 --> 00:14:39,230
This one here

504
00:14:39,230 --> 00:14:41,600
Is there really?

505
00:14:41,600 --> 00:14:43,430
I guess you're right

506
00:14:41,690 --> 00:16:05,080
5th Store Yoshiike Okachimachi Store

507
00:14:44,700 --> 00:14:46,230
Don't forget your strategy

508
00:14:46,230 --> 00:14:50,030
This is where we'll try out Tanaka's tactic

509
00:14:52,560 --> 00:14:55,700
Spring Onion Ball please

510
00:14:52,600 --> 00:15:00,910
Spring Onion Ball

511
00:14:55,700 --> 00:14:57,700
Please have a seat, guys

512
00:14:57,700 --> 00:14:59,700
No no, Tanaka should be the one sitting

513
00:14:59,700 --> 00:15:02,580
Tanaka's the important one here, the rest of us are just extras

514
00:15:02,580 --> 00:15:04,050
We will just follow his lead

515
00:15:04,290 --> 00:15:06,770
Anyway, you guys have to eat one piece each

516
00:15:06,770 --> 00:15:08,400
Firstly, you guys have your one piece each

517
00:15:08,400 --> 00:15:11,660
As usual, first, we have one piece each

518
00:15:12,770 --> 00:15:15,260
Maybe I should have brought my own chopsticks?

519
00:15:15,260 --> 00:15:16,730
What?

520
00:15:16,730 --> 00:15:18,060
My own chopsticks

521
00:15:19,680 --> 00:15:21,250
It's good

522
00:15:21,400 --> 00:15:22,860
Really? Well, I guess for now it is

523
00:15:22,980 --> 00:15:25,060
Tanaka, are you sure you can take 4 pieces?

524
00:15:25,060 --> 00:15:28,450
Yea, first I'll just, you know

525
00:15:28,540 --> 00:15:32,910
If I do this here, we can start rotating...

526
00:15:33,210 --> 00:15:34,960
Shut up and eat

527
00:15:34,960 --> 00:15:36,060
Go on!

528
00:15:37,810 --> 00:15:38,750
Hamada, could you please

529
00:15:38,750 --> 00:15:42,350
Hamada, could you please

530
00:15:38,770 --> 00:15:42,350
That's a sign of affection

531
00:15:38,770 --> 00:15:42,350
refrain from violent behavior?

532
00:15:42,350 --> 00:15:46,360
He's sacrificing himself, so you shouldn't be treating him like that...

533
00:15:44,430 --> 00:15:46,360
Yeah exactly

534
00:15:46,360 --> 00:15:48,600
I'm sacrificing myself here

535
00:15:50,610 --> 00:15:54,490
During my turn, make sure you don't try that

536
00:15:54,490 --> 00:15:56,490
Woah, he's eaten 3 pieces already

537
00:15:59,270 --> 00:16:03,060
He's finished them all

538
00:16:00,600 --> 00:16:05,040
Complete

539
00:16:03,060 --> 00:16:05,060
Finally, he's actually trying

540
00:16:05,040 --> 00:16:06,740
We're going on foot now

541
00:16:05,040 --> 00:16:09,750
5th Store

542
00:16:05,040 --> 00:16:09,750
5th Store

543
00:16:05,040 --> 00:16:09,750
6th Store

544
00:16:05,040 --> 00:16:09,750
6th Store

545
00:16:05,040 --> 00:16:09,750
Ueno Ameyoko Store

546
00:16:05,040 --> 00:16:09,750
Yoshiike Okachimachi Store

547
00:16:06,740 --> 00:16:08,930
It's not far away

548
00:16:07,900 --> 00:16:08,930
It's close by

549
00:16:09,760 --> 00:16:14,490
Let's have a look at the scoreboard. With the 4 pieces that Tanaka just ate, he's up to 10 pieces now

550
00:16:14,490 --> 00:16:16,490
I'm on the top of the leaderboard now

551
00:16:16,490 --> 00:16:19,890
We have 7, 7, 8, 8, and 10 pieces

552
00:16:19,890 --> 00:16:22,660
So, for the 6th store... Endo?

553
00:16:21,200 --> 00:16:22,660
I'll have a go

554
00:16:22,660 --> 00:16:26,540
If Endo does finish them, he'll be up to 12 pieces

555
00:16:27,110 --> 00:16:28,960
Are we in Amemura?

556
00:16:28,960 --> 00:16:32,700
Yea, from here all the way to the Ueno station

557
00:16:32,900 --> 00:16:35,330
Don't you mean Ameyoko?

558
00:16:35,340 --> 00:16:36,970
But you were saying Amemura

559
00:16:36,970 --> 00:16:38,870
Right, Amemura's in Osaka

560
00:16:38,870 --> 00:16:42,990
We've arrived at the store

561
00:16:38,910 --> 00:16:43,650
Store no. 6 Ueno Ameyoko Store

562
00:16:43,640 --> 00:16:45,500
We can eat inside this time

563
00:16:43,650 --> 00:17:51,280
Store no. 6 Ueno Ameyoko Store

564
00:16:44,640 --> 00:16:46,200
Oh, you're right

565
00:16:48,890 --> 00:16:58,760
Cheese Mentaiko

566
00:16:49,040 --> 00:16:50,680
Cheese Mentaiko please

567
00:16:50,680 --> 00:16:52,970
Are you serious?

568
00:16:53,100 --> 00:16:55,300
Wow, this is unexpected

569
00:16:56,040 --> 00:16:56,730
The cold is our biggest obstacle

570
00:16:56,730 --> 00:16:58,760
The cold is our biggest obstacle

571
00:16:58,760 --> 00:17:00,760
This one will take a bit of your energy away..

572
00:17:00,760 --> 00:17:02,380
Yea, the cold's not helping, is it

573
00:17:02,420 --> 00:17:02,730
SO, WHEN IT'S COLD OUT

574
00:17:02,730 --> 00:17:06,130
SO, WHEN IT'S COLD OUT

575
00:17:03,620 --> 00:17:06,130
DOES IT SELL BETTER?

576
00:17:04,660 --> 00:17:06,130
I guess so

577
00:17:06,130 --> 00:17:09,570
You're so bloody loud

578
00:17:09,570 --> 00:17:12,800
Lower your voice a little

579
00:17:09,570 --> 00:17:12,800
You're being too loud

580
00:17:12,800 --> 00:17:14,060
Like you're back at school...

581
00:17:14,700 --> 00:17:15,900
Thanks. Here we go

582
00:17:15,950 --> 00:17:17,800
Shozo, you're up

583
00:17:16,600 --> 00:17:17,200
Yup

584
00:17:17,300 --> 00:17:18,700
Are we eating outside?

585
00:17:19,330 --> 00:17:20,220
Yea, we're eating it outside

586
00:17:20,220 --> 00:17:22,220
You can have the whole pack

587
00:17:21,560 --> 00:17:24,220
Wait, the rule says we've got to eat one each

588
00:17:24,390 --> 00:17:26,420
But I ate one piece just now

589
00:17:26,440 --> 00:17:28,110
First, one piece each

590
00:17:29,000 --> 00:17:32,140
Here I go

591
00:17:32,140 --> 00:17:34,140
I just noticed, you guys always take chopsticks over toothpicks, huh?

592
00:17:34,310 --> 00:17:35,770
Bon appetit

593
00:17:36,710 --> 00:17:38,700
It's hot, ow

594
00:17:38,290 --> 00:17:40,200
Tanaka has taken his turn, now Endo is up

595
00:17:41,150 --> 00:17:43,640
Taking on the challenge to eat 4 pieces of Cheese Mentaiko

596
00:17:44,790 --> 00:17:46,770
Tanaka, you did it too, right?

597
00:17:46,770 --> 00:17:48,770
He's almost finished, well done

598
00:17:48,770 --> 00:17:51,280
All done

599
00:17:49,080 --> 00:17:51,280
Complete

600
00:17:51,280 --> 00:17:57,960
6th Store

601
00:17:51,280 --> 00:17:57,960
6th Store

602
00:17:51,280 --> 00:17:57,960
7th Store

603
00:17:51,280 --> 00:17:57,960
7th Store

604
00:17:51,280 --> 00:17:57,960
Kinshicho Station Terminal Store

605
00:17:51,280 --> 00:17:57,960
Ueno Ameyoko Store

606
00:17:51,700 --> 00:17:57,850
As expected, eating 4 pieces makes me quite full. I'm not sure I can go on

607
00:17:58,600 --> 00:17:59,590
What the hell is this whispering! You two

608
00:17:59,590 --> 00:18:00,260
What the hell is this whispering! You two

609
00:18:00,260 --> 00:18:01,720
What the hell is this whispering! You two

610
00:18:00,500 --> 00:18:02,060
Sorry

611
00:18:01,720 --> 00:18:03,630
These two here are planning something sinister

612
00:18:03,630 --> 00:18:04,260
These two here are planning something sinister

613
00:18:04,260 --> 00:18:05,690
These two here are planning something sinister

614
00:18:05,100 --> 00:18:06,130
No no, we're not

615
00:18:05,690 --> 00:18:08,930
A SINISTER PLOT!?

616
00:18:06,690 --> 00:18:08,930
It's because we both had to eat 4 pieces

617
00:18:07,330 --> 00:18:08,930
Calm down calm down

618
00:18:08,930 --> 00:18:09,470
AT THE NEXT STORE 4 PIECES FOR YOU!

619
00:18:09,470 --> 00:18:12,400
AT THE NEXT STORE 4 PIECES FOR YOU!

620
00:18:11,700 --> 00:18:15,030
That's the punishment for your evil plotting!

621
00:18:12,560 --> 00:18:15,030
No no, there's no way

622
00:18:16,160 --> 00:18:18,390
I can still keep going

623
00:18:18,390 --> 00:18:21,280
I was just thinking

624
00:18:21,280 --> 00:18:25,580
I don't think it's a very efficient strategy

625
00:18:25,580 --> 00:18:28,510
While one person is eating

626
00:18:25,580 --> 00:18:28,510
the rest are just standing around watching

627
00:18:28,510 --> 00:18:30,310
I did think of that too

628
00:18:30,310 --> 00:18:30,920
The audience won't be

629
00:18:30,920 --> 00:18:32,520
The audience won't be

630
00:18:30,940 --> 00:18:32,520
entertained enough

631
00:18:32,520 --> 00:18:35,520
I felt so very bored

632
00:18:34,000 --> 00:18:36,360
But that was quite obvious from the plan

633
00:18:36,360 --> 00:18:38,130
Was that not what you were expecting?

634
00:18:38,130 --> 00:18:39,620
I'm sure I can do the next one

635
00:18:39,620 --> 00:18:43,030
So, I'll be

636
00:18:40,210 --> 00:18:43,030
having 4 pieces

637
00:18:41,450 --> 00:18:42,400
You want to try?

638
00:18:42,450 --> 00:18:45,030
Okay, Matsumoto's having 4

639
00:18:46,390 --> 00:18:46,700
Lastly, I will

640
00:18:46,700 --> 00:18:51,140
Lastly, I will

641
00:18:47,120 --> 00:18:51,140
eat 4 pieces

642
00:18:48,920 --> 00:18:51,140
Wait, what do you mean by "lastly"?

643
00:18:51,560 --> 00:18:54,270
Actually, I don't see why Hamada can't be next

644
00:18:54,270 --> 00:18:55,940
Would you be okay?

645
00:18:55,940 --> 00:19:01,110
If you don't have 4 pieces now

646
00:18:57,360 --> 00:19:01,110
are you really going to be okay?

647
00:18:59,700 --> 00:19:01,110
What do you mean?

648
00:19:01,110 --> 00:19:05,280
I don't quite understand

649
00:19:02,300 --> 00:19:05,280
what you meant by "okay"

650
00:19:03,120 --> 00:19:06,630
It's because he's so worried for you

651
00:19:07,070 --> 00:19:09,800
Well, it's about lunchtime now

652
00:19:10,130 --> 00:19:12,300
If you're fine,

653
00:19:10,130 --> 00:19:12,300
then I'll go now

654
00:19:12,300 --> 00:19:14,190
I still don't get what

655
00:19:12,300 --> 00:19:14,190
your "okay" means

656
00:19:14,200 --> 00:19:15,330
Ask him

657
00:19:15,330 --> 00:19:18,300
Hamada doesn't quite understand

658
00:19:16,950 --> 00:19:18,300
what you mean by "okay"

659
00:19:18,300 --> 00:19:21,060
I'm just wondering if

660
00:19:19,850 --> 00:19:21,060
he doesn't go now, will he be okay later...

661
00:19:21,060 --> 00:19:26,900
I worry that he won't be

662
00:19:21,820 --> 00:19:26,900
if he doesn't go now...

663
00:19:27,380 --> 00:19:37,050
Store no. 7 Kinshicho Station Terminal Store

664
00:19:27,390 --> 00:19:29,050
Okay, we've arrived

665
00:19:29,050 --> 00:19:31,050
Let's go

666
00:19:31,270 --> 00:19:33,780
So cold~

667
00:19:33,780 --> 00:19:34,860
Over here

668
00:19:34,860 --> 00:19:36,430
It's so cold~

669
00:19:36,430 --> 00:19:38,430
I'm freezing

670
00:19:37,050 --> 00:21:07,180
Store no. 7 Kinshicho Station Terminal Store

671
00:19:38,430 --> 00:19:40,010
We're counting on you

672
00:19:40,750 --> 00:19:42,820
YOSSSSHHHHHHAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA!!!

673
00:19:44,690 --> 00:19:47,420
Takoyaki, this one!

674
00:19:47,430 --> 00:19:48,950
Original please

675
00:19:47,770 --> 00:19:51,840
Original

676
00:19:48,950 --> 00:19:51,740
Sorry, I didn't quite order properly

677
00:19:51,880 --> 00:19:54,710
So we'll have one piece each

678
00:19:53,000 --> 00:19:54,710
Only one piece each

679
00:19:54,710 --> 00:19:56,360
I'm going to have my one piece first

680
00:19:56,360 --> 00:19:57,940
Should I put on the mayonnaise

681
00:19:57,940 --> 00:20:00,170
As you like

682
00:20:03,010 --> 00:20:04,980
Excuse me, coming through

683
00:20:04,010 --> 00:20:05,980
It looks hot

684
00:20:07,650 --> 00:20:09,680
There's 4 pieces for you

685
00:20:11,620 --> 00:20:12,580
It's good

686
00:20:17,470 --> 00:20:18,660
I see

687
00:20:22,240 --> 00:20:25,630
Pick up

688
00:20:22,670 --> 00:20:25,630
the next piece

689
00:20:22,700 --> 00:20:25,630
If you could pick up the pace

690
00:20:25,630 --> 00:20:28,260
Matsumoto, since we've got a schedule to keep to

691
00:20:28,260 --> 00:20:30,610
If you could increase your pace a little

692
00:20:30,610 --> 00:20:31,920
It'd be great if you could hurry up

693
00:20:31,920 --> 00:20:33,720
That would be really great

694
00:20:36,050 --> 00:20:38,540
What are you rolling it about for?

695
00:20:39,170 --> 00:20:40,730
Just go one after another...

696
00:20:40,730 --> 00:20:42,730
makes it easier to eat

697
00:20:41,820 --> 00:20:42,800
Yea, probably

698
00:20:42,800 --> 00:20:45,910
Are you guys serious? Should I eat them all?

699
00:20:50,890 --> 00:20:54,000
Ah I see

700
00:20:54,000 --> 00:20:57,200
*Matsumoto hits his mic

701
00:20:58,020 --> 00:20:59,770
He just admitted it

702
00:20:59,770 --> 00:21:01,070
He really did...

703
00:21:01,070 --> 00:21:02,010
Last piece

704
00:21:02,010 --> 00:21:06,850
He's done it. Good job

705
00:21:02,740 --> 00:21:07,180
Complete

706
00:21:03,510 --> 00:21:06,850
All finished

707
00:21:07,380 --> 00:21:09,040

We're running short on time, we have to get to the next store now

715
00:21:12,900 --> 00:21:15,700
Hey, umm......

716
00:21:15,750 --> 00:21:19,120
Since I already ate

717
00:21:17,440 --> 00:21:19,120
a rice ball before we started

718
00:21:19,120 --> 00:21:22,120
That's your own problem

719
00:21:22,120 --> 00:21:24,960
Why'd you go and eat it?

720
00:21:28,430 --> 00:21:34,410
Store no. 8 Shinkoiwa Store

721
00:21:28,510 --> 00:21:31,110

One Spring Onion Ball coming up. Here you go, thanks

728
00:21:42,710 --> 00:21:45,830
We're each going to have one piece first

729
00:21:46,690 --> 00:21:49,690
Could you guys please take more of the spring onion?

730
00:21:49,690 --> 00:21:52,500
You all are barely getting any

731
00:21:52,500 --> 00:21:54,500
Yes yes, please have more

732
00:21:55,500 --> 00:21:56,790
It's good

733
00:22:01,810 --> 00:22:05,690
You've only had one, and already look full

734
00:22:06,640 --> 00:22:09,100
It shouldn't be a problem, right?

735
00:22:09,240 --> 00:22:12,710
You just look

736
00:22:09,610 --> 00:22:12,700
like an old geezer...

737
00:22:12,700 --> 00:22:14,130
He's taking his time to chew

738
00:22:14,130 --> 00:22:15,370
He's only moving his mouth

739
00:22:15,370 --> 00:22:16,800
Here I go!

740
00:22:19,810 --> 00:22:21,280
Nicely done

So, Hamada, you're having 4 pieces of

750
00:22:26,550 --> 00:22:28,990
Teriyaki w/ Egg,

751
00:22:27,570 --> 00:22:28,990
is that okay?

752
00:22:28,990 --> 00:22:30,360
Yea, Teriyaki w/ Egg

753
00:22:30,360 --> 00:22:33,020
Teriyaki w/ Egg?

754
00:22:34,050 --> 00:22:36,390
He already agreed to it earlier

755
00:22:36,390 --> 00:22:39,760
He's really going senile

756
00:22:39,800 --> 00:22:45,780
9th Store Koiwa popo Store

757
00:22:40,000 --> 00:22:44,670

00:22:44,670 --> 00:22:47,850
At this store, Hamada will take up the 4 piece challenge

759
00:22:45,780 --> 00:23:45,800

760
00:22:48,070 --> 00:22:49,850

761
00:22:48,410 --> 00:22:55,490
Teritama

762
00:22:50,400 --> 00:22:52,830
Yes acknowledged

763
00:22:52,830 --> 00:22:54,830
Teritama or  is back again

764
00:22:57,460 --> 00:22:59,030
Thank you

765
00:22:59,030 --> 00:23:01,930
Let's have a seat over that way

766
00:23:02,930 --> 00:23:04,730
It looks really dense

767
00:23:04,730 --> 00:23:06,730
Yea, it does, doesn't it

768
00:23:06,730 --> 00:23:08,730
This one's not going to be easy

769
00:23:14,650 --> 00:23:21,410
We should continue with this strategy

770
00:23:15,690 --> 00:23:17,510
and just switch the flavors

771
00:23:17,510 --> 00:23:21,410
and just switch the flavors

772
00:23:18,650 --> 00:23:21,410
I agree, we should change the flavors

773
00:23:20,700 --> 00:23:21,700
What do you mean?

774
00:23:21,730 --> 00:23:22,680
We should decide one flavor

775
00:23:22,680 --> 00:23:23,480
We should decide one flavor

776
00:23:23,480 --> 00:23:26,440
We should decide one flavor

777
00:23:23,500 --> 00:23:26,440
For each person, agree?

778
00:23:25,100 --> 00:23:26,440
Hey wait wait

779
00:23:26,440 --> 00:23:30,610
"Teritama" will be

780
00:23:27,330 --> 00:23:30,610
Hamada's

781
00:23:27,440 --> 00:23:29,610
No way no way

782
00:23:28,490 --> 00:23:30,610
I see

783
00:23:31,270 --> 00:23:31,660
"Hamada's Teritama"

784
00:23:31,660 --> 00:23:37,050
"Hamada's Teritama"

785
00:23:33,260 --> 00:23:34,900
Shall we do that then?

786
00:23:34,900 --> 00:23:36,900
so each person eats their own one...

787
00:23:37,200 --> 00:23:42,090
Yes, he's done

788
00:23:42,170 --> 00:23:45,800
Complete

789
00:23:42,300 --> 00:23:44,090
All done

790
00:23:46,090 --> 00:23:49,780
How well will the 4 piece strategy work?

791
00:23:50,000 --> 00:23:54,810
I need someone to help me

792
00:23:50,000 --> 00:23:54,810
Will they be able to make it through all 37 stores in 23 districts?

793
00:23:55,210 --> 00:23:58,010
Will they be drinking to celebrate or drown their sorrows?

794
00:23:58,010 --> 00:24:04,310
I do not want to eat anymore

795
00:24:01,000 --> 00:24:04,310
Next week, the exciting conclusion unfolds!

796
00:24:04,310 --> 00:24:06,310
Mmm~ That was good
