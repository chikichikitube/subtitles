1
00:00:29,190 --> 00:00:31,830
Nice to meet you   -Good evening

2
00:00:31,830 --> 00:00:34,010
It's season 7 now   -Yes

3
00:00:35,630 --> 00:00:39,820
Last time, there were a lot of female comedians

4
00:00:39,820 --> 00:00:45,500
And that season was unique in its own way

5
00:00:40,730 --> 00:00:44,760
The most ever, with 4 female comedians

6
00:00:45,500 --> 00:00:47,840
"Should I go this way?"

7
00:00:47,840 --> 00:00:50,490
"Nope, I'll go this way and turn around"

8
00:00:53,150 --> 00:00:56,040
For this time, I'll change it back to how it used to be again

9
00:00:56,040 --> 00:00:58,040
With many of them making their first appearance

10
00:00:58,040 --> 00:01:00,040
I bet it will be interesting

11
00:01:00,040 --> 00:01:01,140
The Naive M-1 Champion

12
00:01:01,140 --> 00:01:02,720
The Addictive Tsukkomi Dominant

13
00:01:02,720 --> 00:01:04,300
The New Comedy Vader

14
00:01:04,300 --> 00:01:05,900
The Desperate Off-white Comedian

15
00:01:05,900 --> 00:01:07,480
The Grilled Meat Lion Dance

16
00:01:07,480 --> 00:01:09,080
The Regretful Face Weapon

17
00:01:09,080 --> 00:01:10,640
The Resurrection of Golden Pig

18
00:01:10,640 --> 00:01:12,050
The Bird Face Guitar Man

19
00:01:12,050 --> 00:01:13,730
The Incredible Penguin Man

20
00:01:13,730 --> 00:01:15,240
The Citizen of "Hanma Kanma"

21
00:01:15,530 --> 00:01:24,070
Incredible newcomers are joining one after another

22
00:01:25,060 --> 00:01:28,070
And now, the chaotic party begins

23
00:01:28,480 --> 00:01:34,710
The fight between the no-carders

24
00:01:35,120 --> 00:01:41,000
The battle barely coping with rules

25
00:01:41,010 --> 00:01:45,760
The back-and-forth of knock-outs

26
00:01:47,620 --> 00:01:50,090
6 hours later

27
00:01:52,720 --> 00:01:54,940
Looking back at today's contest

28
00:01:54,940 --> 00:01:56,600
Thank you for your hard work   -Thank you very much

29
00:01:57,140 --> 00:02:00,100
It's amazing this time, again   -Yeah...

30
00:02:00,900 --> 00:02:04,320
I'm exhausted from laughing

31
00:02:04,820 --> 00:02:12,040
These comedians were doing interesting things for so many hours nonstop

32
00:02:12,040 --> 00:02:17,330
I'm even worried whether this is appropriate for the work-style reform proposal

33
00:02:17,330 --> 00:02:19,700
It was just as I expected

34
00:02:19,700 --> 00:02:21,750
Or even better than expected

35
00:02:22,700 --> 00:02:25,850
No time wasted until the very last second

36
00:02:26,350 --> 00:02:34,130
The Naive M-1 Champion
The Addictive Tsukkomi Dominant
The New Comedy Vader
The Desperate Off-white Comedian
The Grilled Meat Lion Dance
The Regretful Face Weapon
The Resurrection of Golden Pig
The Bird Face Guitar Man
The Incredible Penguin Man
The citizen of "Hanma Kanma"

37
00:03:49,860 --> 00:03:52,340
Last week, when I had a lesson at teatime

38
00:03:52,340 --> 00:03:55,740
I met someone called Yayoi-san

39
00:03:55,740 --> 00:04:00,220
I asked Yayoi-san, "Were you born in March?"

40
00:04:00,220 --> 00:04:03,000
And Yayoi-san replied, "I was born in July"

41
00:04:03,000 --> 00:04:06,010
I felt a bit disappointed

42
00:04:06,670 --> 00:04:10,240
That being said, I would like to offer you an invitation

43
00:04:11,360 --> 00:04:16,600
Could you prepare one million yen
and gather at a designated location?

44
00:04:16,600 --> 00:04:19,870
I shall reinitiate Documental

45
00:04:19,870 --> 00:04:24,250
I have prepared a reward of 10 million yen for the winner

46
00:04:24,870 --> 00:04:28,540
Of course, participation is voluntary

47
00:04:28,540 --> 00:04:35,090
For those of you who wish to participate, I shall inform you of the time and location

48
00:04:35,090 --> 00:04:39,030
Awaiting your reply

49
00:04:39,450 --> 00:04:45,670
I hope that an innocent Spring will visit all of you in April

50
00:04:45,830 --> 00:04:48,970
Sincerely, Matsumoto Hitoshi

51
00:04:52,280 --> 00:04:57,560
THE PARTICIPATING COMEDIANS ENTER

52
00:05:00,370 --> 00:05:01,350
Here he comes

53
00:05:03,030 --> 00:05:05,550
Very exciting, huh?

54
00:05:07,170 --> 00:05:08,300
Come on!

55
00:05:09,840 --> 00:05:11,390
I'm the first one again

56
00:05:13,720 --> 00:05:16,300
Come on...again?

57
00:05:18,100 --> 00:05:20,300
Hello, I'm Nobu from Chidori

58
00:05:20,300 --> 00:05:21,990
Thanks for having me

59
00:05:23,570 --> 00:05:24,300
Eh?

60
00:05:24,710 --> 00:05:26,310
What?

61
00:05:27,030 --> 00:05:28,590
Wait a second...

62
00:05:28,590 --> 00:05:30,310
This is enough

63
00:05:30,880 --> 00:05:32,320
This is enough!

64
00:05:33,040 --> 00:05:35,910
This guy is very skilled at Owarai

65
00:05:35,910 --> 00:05:40,320
As a side effect, he tends to save every joke that others told

66
00:05:41,200 --> 00:05:44,320
Which in turn, makes himself laugh

67
00:05:44,320 --> 00:05:46,720
He's weak

68
00:05:46,720 --> 00:05:47,880
Very weak

69
00:05:47,880 --> 00:05:52,010
My defense is too weak, I almost laughed at every joke

70
00:05:52,010 --> 00:05:55,890
*The weakest comedian in Documental

71
00:05:53,490 --> 00:05:58,690
So this time, I discovered a face that even Matsumoto-san won't say it's inappropriate

72
00:05:58,690 --> 00:06:01,550
And I've been training myself with that face

73
00:06:01,550 --> 00:06:03,340
Yes, I invented this face

74
00:06:03,340 --> 00:06:04,350
This is it...

75
00:06:05,650 --> 00:06:07,880
The dodging face

76
00:06:08,090 --> 00:06:10,360
"Hey no, listen to me..."

77
00:06:10,540 --> 00:06:12,950
Does this face count as laughing?   -I don't think so...

78
00:06:12,950 --> 00:06:14,360
What did he order?

79
00:06:13,180 --> 00:06:17,400
Last time, he made a desperate attack

80
00:06:14,360 --> 00:06:15,450
Whelk sushi

81
00:06:15,450 --> 00:06:16,360
Whelk sushi?

82
00:06:16,360 --> 00:06:18,360
2000 pieces   -2000 pieces?

83
00:06:18,360 --> 00:06:20,370
Huh? Oops...

84
00:06:18,360 --> 00:06:22,130
A dirty performance that he's not used to

85
00:06:20,370 --> 00:06:22,370
Here comes the pee

86
00:06:23,030 --> 00:06:28,370
That severely damaged the career of the man, Nobu, as a comedian

87
00:06:28,720 --> 00:06:33,130
When other decent shows think about asking Chidori to be the host

88
00:06:33,130 --> 00:06:36,380
They are reluctant to do so because of the "peeing incident"

89
00:06:36,760 --> 00:06:38,450
I really want to rewrite it

90
00:06:38,450 --> 00:06:40,380
I want rewrite everyone's memories

91
00:06:40,380 --> 00:06:43,690
It's not just about the audiences

92
00:06:43,690 --> 00:06:45,430
I want to make Matsumoto Hitoshi-san think that

93
00:06:45,430 --> 00:06:51,500
"Nobu is the best Tsukkomi in the world of Owarai"

94
00:06:51,500 --> 00:06:54,390
That's my aim for today

95
00:06:58,390 --> 00:06:59,760
Who else? Who?!

96
00:07:02,470 --> 00:07:05,720
There're just so many comedians gathering each time

97
00:07:10,090 --> 00:07:13,320
I sincerely hope they're all boring people

98
00:07:16,170 --> 00:07:18,610
Nice to meet you   -Nice to meet you

99
00:07:18,610 --> 00:07:20,760
This is quite unexpected, right?

100
00:07:24,300 --> 00:07:26,270
Hello, I'm Kato from Zabunguru

101
00:07:26,270 --> 00:07:27,580
Today...

102
00:07:27,580 --> 00:07:29,540
I will definitely...

103
00:07:29,540 --> 00:07:32,430
Definitely win!!!

104
00:07:32,930 --> 00:07:34,640
I'm fully prepared

105
00:07:37,280 --> 00:07:38,440
Hello

106
00:07:42,560 --> 00:07:44,290
Whoa! Really?

107
00:07:44,290 --> 00:07:45,750
Whoa!!!

108
00:07:45,750 --> 00:07:48,950
Here it comes!!

109
00:07:49,770 --> 00:07:52,800
This is his first appearance

110
00:07:52,800 --> 00:07:56,960
I bet he has been thinking about this even last night

111
00:07:56,960 --> 00:08:00,900
And I bet he'll find out that none of his plans will work here

112
00:08:02,220 --> 00:08:05,550
The Regretful Face Weapon

113
00:08:05,550 --> 00:08:08,130
But if he can handle and get through this

114
00:08:08,130 --> 00:08:14,960
I believe he can come up with something interesting, and I'm looking forward to it

115
00:08:15,730 --> 00:08:17,640
"That dude is not funny"

116
00:08:17,640 --> 00:08:19,020
"He always cries"

117
00:08:19,020 --> 00:08:20,690
People are looking down on me

118
00:08:20,690 --> 00:08:22,720
They always think that I'm a wimp

119
00:08:22,720 --> 00:08:24,360
Although I'm actually not

120
00:08:24,360 --> 00:08:25,890
I've been perceived like this by the public

121
00:08:25,890 --> 00:08:29,200
However, if I can win this contest, I believe things will change

122
00:08:29,200 --> 00:08:33,330
Therefore, in order to get rid of this "wimp character", I have to win

123
00:08:33,330 --> 00:08:36,180
The best defense is a good offense

124
00:08:36,180 --> 00:08:42,500
I'll be attacking aggressively, even against senior comedians

125
00:08:48,000 --> 00:08:50,510
Seriously, get ready for the fight you people

126
00:08:50,730 --> 00:08:54,510
I'm gonna make you laugh so hard and puke!!

127
00:08:54,510 --> 00:08:58,520
"Wimp character"

128
00:09:00,340 --> 00:09:08,530
Well, the staffs did tell me that he prepared something amazing though

129
00:09:14,100 --> 00:09:16,540
Does it feel different for the 1st and 2nd time?

130
00:09:16,540 --> 00:09:18,540
Well, yeah...

131
00:09:19,300 --> 00:09:20,540
Who is it?

132
00:09:21,260 --> 00:09:24,550
Come on!

133
00:09:25,030 --> 00:09:27,070
Goto-san

134
00:09:29,480 --> 00:09:31,710
Eh?   -Goto-san

135
00:09:33,010 --> 00:09:34,960
I'm Goto from Footballhour

136
00:09:34,960 --> 00:09:39,390
Same as last time, I'm feeling nervous as soon as I enter the studio

137
00:09:40,990 --> 00:09:43,270
This is for you

138
00:09:43,510 --> 00:09:44,570
Here it is

139
00:09:45,320 --> 00:09:47,680
Of course I'll go

140
00:09:47,680 --> 00:09:50,570
I have no reason to refuse this

141
00:09:50,570 --> 00:09:52,570
Tsukkomi Sniper

142
00:09:52,570 --> 00:09:57,040
In terms of Tsukkomi...

143
00:09:57,040 --> 00:10:05,860
I think it's fair to say that Nobu and Goto are the two giants in the world of Owarai

144
00:10:05,860 --> 00:10:10,050
Hamada was said to be the giant at one time

145
00:10:10,050 --> 00:10:13,150
But he's at rock bottom now

146
00:10:13,150 --> 00:10:15,190
All he says now is "why the heck"

147
00:10:15,190 --> 00:10:16,600
Throughout the whole year

148
00:10:16,980 --> 00:10:21,800
Goto is very attentive to details

149
00:10:21,800 --> 00:10:26,380
And his Tsukkomis are always in long sentences

150
00:10:26,380 --> 00:10:28,210
So that's the sweet spot

151
00:10:29,050 --> 00:10:29,680
Amazing!

152
00:10:30,610 --> 00:10:32,540
He's The Ventures

153
00:10:34,800 --> 00:10:36,260
Playing with electricity

154
00:10:36,380 --> 00:10:38,550
I screwed up

155
00:10:38,550 --> 00:10:41,050
Goto was the one I needed to watch out for

156
00:10:41,050 --> 00:10:43,690
When you think about it, he really is an all-round player

157
00:10:43,690 --> 00:10:47,340
It's a place that I never experienced before

158
00:10:47,340 --> 00:10:51,380
But it's also a place full of excitement

159
00:10:51,380 --> 00:10:55,040
Nothing goes as planned, and I believe that's true for everyone else

160
00:10:55,040 --> 00:10:58,380
That's why we're all left frustrated after losing the contest

161
00:10:58,380 --> 00:11:02,650
And if we ever get invited again, we will accept it and take revenge

162
00:11:04,390 --> 00:11:07,840
The most horrible comedians come last

163
00:11:13,370 --> 00:11:15,200
He just went to the convenient store?

164
00:11:17,640 --> 00:11:18,660
Here he comes!

165
00:11:19,060 --> 00:11:20,460
Here he comes

166
00:11:21,660 --> 00:11:26,330
*Soshina and Seiya are partners of the comedy duo "Shimofuri Myojo"

167
00:11:21,660 --> 00:11:26,330
So it's not Soshina but Seiya instead

168
00:11:26,330 --> 00:11:28,670
I know you, you lost the R-1 competition, right?   -Wait...why?

169
00:11:28,670 --> 00:11:30,670
Just say I'm the one who won the M-1 competition

170
00:11:31,110 --> 00:11:33,790
Hello, I'm Seiya from Shimofuri Myojo

171
00:11:33,790 --> 00:11:38,080
In continuation of the M-1 competition, I want to win Documental as well

172
00:11:39,660 --> 00:11:40,680
No way...

173
00:11:41,870 --> 00:11:42,840
What is this?

174
00:11:42,840 --> 00:11:45,240
It's Documental

175
00:11:45,240 --> 00:11:47,590
It's Documental!

176
00:11:47,590 --> 00:11:51,680
I'm looking forward to his performance

177
00:11:51,680 --> 00:11:56,700
And I think he may get into a miserable situation, which is worth looking forward to as well

178
00:11:56,700 --> 00:12:03,920
If he can show his childish and naughty side, then maybe that could be his way out

179
00:12:03,920 --> 00:12:05,830
The Naive M-1 Champion

180
00:12:05,830 --> 00:12:09,350
After winning the M-1 competition...

181
00:12:09,350 --> 00:12:12,210
I thought I don't need to fight anymore, then here comes Documental?

182
00:12:12,210 --> 00:12:14,290
The battles are coming way too quickly

183
00:12:14,290 --> 00:12:16,720
I haven't even received the 10 million cash prize for M-1

184
00:12:16,720 --> 00:12:21,170
Because I'm afraid that people are expecting too much from Soshina

185
00:12:18,160 --> 00:12:21,170
Why isn't Soshina invited to the battle?

186
00:12:21,170 --> 00:12:25,270
Yes, that's true, many say that "Soshina is good, but Seiya should just shut up"

187
00:12:25,270 --> 00:12:29,770
Or like "Seiya is just Soshina's repeater"

188
00:12:30,370 --> 00:12:32,660
After winning the M-1 and Suberanai Hanashi

189
00:12:32,660 --> 00:12:36,740
Everything changed in just one night

190
00:12:37,880 --> 00:12:42,740
Winning Documental will be another life-changing moment

191
00:12:42,740 --> 00:12:44,560
Instead of being clean and neat

192
00:12:44,560 --> 00:12:48,170
I want to fight face to face with Owarai

193
00:12:48,170 --> 00:12:52,750
I want to get dirty and muddy, and show people the soul of a comedian

194
00:12:56,390 --> 00:13:00,050
He has this gag like "I am Se, Se, Seiya..."

195
00:13:00,050 --> 00:13:02,500
It's gonna be awkward if he does that

196
00:13:02,500 --> 00:13:04,530
That's a bit...

197
00:13:12,040 --> 00:13:14,300
Here he comes!

198
00:13:14,300 --> 00:13:16,140
You joined this before already

199
00:13:16,140 --> 00:13:17,200
It's Goto...

200
00:13:17,200 --> 00:13:18,520
It's Tamura-san

201
00:13:18,520 --> 00:13:19,410
You must be kidding me...

202
00:13:19,410 --> 00:13:22,600
I definitely can't hold back on Tamura-san's jokes

203
00:13:22,600 --> 00:13:24,370
What the heck are these members?

204
00:13:24,780 --> 00:13:28,500
Hello, I'm the Owarai triple champion, Tamura Kenji

205
00:13:28,500 --> 00:13:30,100
Ciao

206
00:13:30,100 --> 00:13:33,320
I've said this for many times, but this is my combat uniform

207
00:13:37,610 --> 00:13:38,810
You must be kidding me

208
00:13:38,810 --> 00:13:40,810
So I did really well last time?

209
00:13:40,810 --> 00:13:44,640
He's the type of comedian that can do both Boke and Tsukkomi

210
00:13:44,640 --> 00:13:47,320
I actually praise Tamuken very highly

211
00:13:47,320 --> 00:13:48,610
However...

212
00:13:48,610 --> 00:13:52,720
I remember nothing about what he did last time

213
00:13:52,720 --> 00:13:55,020
But I think he will improve this time

214
00:13:55,020 --> 00:13:57,140
Stop that...   -Everyone will notice it

215
00:13:57,140 --> 00:13:58,240
You're not even trying to hide it

216
00:13:57,140 --> 00:14:04,410
*The words on Tamuken's chest says "Ramen shops are so scary", because around the time of the show, while he was eating at a Ramen shop, one of the staff took a photo with him and posted it on the official Twitter account, saying that "Tamuken is a boring person without mic and camera". The shop was criticized by many comedy fans on Twitter.

217
00:13:58,240 --> 00:14:02,410
They said "Tamuken is a boring person without mic and camera"

218
00:14:02,410 --> 00:14:04,410
We all know about that...

219
00:14:04,410 --> 00:14:06,660
The contestants are pitiful this time

220
00:14:06,660 --> 00:14:08,820
Because Tamura is in serious mode today

221
00:14:06,660 --> 00:14:10,000
*Kansai's side business king

222
00:14:08,990 --> 00:14:12,000
I'm seriously aiming for the 10 million this time

223
00:14:12,000 --> 00:14:13,860
Because I'm seriously in deep trouble now

224
00:14:13,860 --> 00:14:16,170
I'm being cornered now, honestly

225
00:14:16,170 --> 00:14:20,850
If I lose again, this is going to be a 12 million loss

226
00:14:20,850 --> 00:14:23,180
No, no way, it's just 2 million

227
00:14:23,180 --> 00:14:25,370
I already lost 10 million in cryptocurrency

228
00:14:23,940 --> 00:14:29,610
Loss in cryptocurrency + Loss in Documental for twice = -12 million

229
00:14:25,370 --> 00:14:27,330
Oh, I see   -Yes

230
00:14:27,330 --> 00:14:29,580
It's gonna be a 12 million loss for me

231
00:14:29,580 --> 00:14:32,570
This came just in time! This is destiny!

232
00:14:32,570 --> 00:14:34,210
I'm gonna get the money

233
00:14:34,210 --> 00:14:35,770
And I'm gonna buy it again

234
00:14:35,770 --> 00:14:42,020
If I win 10 million, I'm gonna change that 10 million cash into 10 million crypto

235
00:14:42,020 --> 00:14:45,470
Just trust me and strong hold to the moon

236
00:14:45,470 --> 00:14:49,960
In 2020, it will come again

237
00:14:50,130 --> 00:14:52,870
It's impossible for me to hold back on Tamura-san's jokes

238
00:14:53,210 --> 00:14:56,880
I'm easily amused too, I was out so early last time

239
00:14:56,880 --> 00:14:58,020
Yeah, you're right

240
00:14:58,020 --> 00:15:00,880
Goto, you're easily amused too, right?   -Yes, I'm easily amused

241
00:15:08,400 --> 00:15:10,190
I bet they don't want him to be here

242
00:15:10,190 --> 00:15:12,300
His face is just...

243
00:15:12,300 --> 00:15:14,310
His face looks funny already

244
00:15:14,900 --> 00:15:16,900
I'm angry today   -How come? What happened?

245
00:15:16,900 --> 00:15:18,680
You're angry?   -How come?

246
00:15:18,680 --> 00:15:20,120
Why are you angry?

247
00:15:20,120 --> 00:15:20,800
Damn it

248
00:15:20,800 --> 00:15:22,910
Damn it?

249
00:15:22,910 --> 00:15:24,910
What happened?

250
00:15:24,910 --> 00:15:27,350
I'm Hachimitsu Jiro from Tokyo Dynamite

251
00:15:27,350 --> 00:15:30,910
Today, I will definitely win 11 million

252
00:15:31,130 --> 00:15:32,630
Nice to meet you

253
00:15:32,630 --> 00:15:33,640
This is for you

254
00:15:33,640 --> 00:15:35,520
I already know...

255
00:15:35,520 --> 00:15:38,400
This is the third time already, I know what's going on

256
00:15:38,400 --> 00:15:40,670
So it's finally here

257
00:15:40,670 --> 00:15:43,730
I praised him highly since many years ago

258
00:15:43,730 --> 00:15:46,150
He's incredibly talented

259
00:15:46,150 --> 00:15:48,930
The heavyweight whisperer

260
00:15:48,930 --> 00:15:53,690
He did a very good job last time too

261
00:15:53,690 --> 00:15:57,640
So I actually hope that he can win this time

262
00:15:58,620 --> 00:16:00,620
You were hospitalized due to a heart attack last year, right?   -Yes

263
00:16:00,620 --> 00:16:01,910
Many people are worried about that

264
00:16:01,910 --> 00:16:04,940
But I'm actually completely recovered

265
00:16:04,940 --> 00:16:06,940
It's all about my knees and waist

266
00:16:06,940 --> 00:16:10,630
My knees and waist hurt for being a professional wrestler

267
00:16:10,630 --> 00:16:14,850
I'm pretty sure that if my knees don't hurt, I can do better at making people laugh

268
00:16:14,850 --> 00:16:17,290
I need to battle while protecting my knees

269
00:16:17,290 --> 00:16:19,190
And pretending that my knees are fine

270
00:16:19,190 --> 00:16:21,940
In regard to this, I always watch Mutoh Keiji's matches

271
00:16:21,940 --> 00:16:25,690
And learn how to pretend to be moving while actually not moving

272
00:16:25,690 --> 00:16:27,690
Who are you angry at?

273
00:16:27,690 --> 00:16:29,230
All of you

274
00:16:29,230 --> 00:16:31,840
What do you mean? We met just now

275
00:16:31,840 --> 00:16:34,380
The opposite of "Owarai" is "Anger"

276
00:16:34,380 --> 00:16:37,370
So I want to be full of anger throughout the 6 hours of battle

277
00:16:37,950 --> 00:16:42,030
I once talked with Choshu-san (wrestler) before

278
00:16:42,030 --> 00:16:44,990
And he said that he's always angry during his fights

279
00:16:45,260 --> 00:16:48,990
So I'll learn from him and enter the wrestling ring for Owarai with anger

280
00:16:50,710 --> 00:16:54,200
If your car is broken, go find Tamuken-san

281
00:16:54,200 --> 00:16:56,090
No need to mention that, dude

282
00:16:56,090 --> 00:16:59,220
(Yeah, Tamuken is doing car businesses now too)

283
00:16:59,220 --> 00:17:01,330
(Something like a car trading company)

284
00:17:04,870 --> 00:17:05,820
Well yeah, that's true

285
00:17:05,820 --> 00:17:08,510
Just sell me your car if it's broken

286
00:17:09,650 --> 00:17:11,010
Boring person, please!

287
00:17:12,710 --> 00:17:15,010
Seriously?!   -This is gonna be awful!

288
00:17:15,010 --> 00:17:17,020
I can't believe it!

289
00:17:17,020 --> 00:17:18,190
Koyabu-san!

290
00:17:18,190 --> 00:17:22,440
It is indeed quite surprising for Koyabu to join Documental

291
00:17:22,440 --> 00:17:24,440
It's Koyabu-san!

292
00:17:24,440 --> 00:17:27,030
So scary to be with these members

293
00:17:27,030 --> 00:17:29,030
Koyabu-san...   -Whoa!

294
00:17:29,030 --> 00:17:31,940
I'm Koyabu Kazutoyo from Yoshimoto

295
00:17:31,940 --> 00:17:33,770
I'm so frightened that my body can't stop shaking

296
00:17:36,100 --> 00:17:37,940
I've brought you something

297
00:17:38,620 --> 00:17:41,040
What is this? So scary, what is it?

298
00:17:42,160 --> 00:17:44,040
Damn it...

299
00:17:44,040 --> 00:17:46,280
I really hope I was drawn into some scandals

300
00:17:46,280 --> 00:17:49,370
That would help a lot

301
00:17:49,370 --> 00:17:50,790
This is his first appearance

302
00:17:50,790 --> 00:17:52,540
How should I put it...

303
00:17:52,540 --> 00:17:54,490
He's the "auntie comedian", right?

304
00:17:54,490 --> 00:17:56,420
He's just like an auntie

305
00:17:56,420 --> 00:18:03,070
I'm really curious to see how is he going to one-up others as an auntie

306
00:18:06,060 --> 00:18:09,070
The New Comedy Vader

307
00:18:09,070 --> 00:18:14,280
Honestly, I get to work at Tokyo all because of Matsumoto-san

308
00:18:14,280 --> 00:18:15,710
He invited me to many shows like Suberanai

309
00:18:15,710 --> 00:18:19,080
So I'll be damned badly if I dare to refuse this invitation

310
00:18:20,440 --> 00:18:22,480
He's actually quite easily amused

311
00:18:22,480 --> 00:18:25,080
We were on the same show yesterday

312
00:18:25,080 --> 00:18:29,420
And he bursted into laughter because of Huruichi-san's joke

313
00:18:29,420 --> 00:18:33,100
Would a normal person even laugh at Huruichi-san's jokes?

314
00:18:34,940 --> 00:18:40,090
Medaka, Okure and Suuchi, I bet they can do better than me

315
00:18:40,430 --> 00:18:45,770
To be honest, I actually sometimes think that I'm no longer a comedian, because I'm always hosting news shows recently

316
00:18:45,770 --> 00:18:51,540
So being invited to this show makes me think that, I can still call myself a comedian

317
00:18:51,540 --> 00:18:54,980
Which is very honorable

318
00:18:55,410 --> 00:18:58,630
Despite of being surprised, look at that huge bag he brought

319
00:18:58,630 --> 00:19:01,460
Exactly, his bag is fully stuffed

320
00:19:01,460 --> 00:19:03,520
He's fully prepared

321
00:19:03,520 --> 00:19:06,560
I thought he'll only attack with talks, but...

322
00:19:06,560 --> 00:19:08,560
In order to increase my chance of winning

323
00:19:13,390 --> 00:19:14,340
Three more people

324
00:19:14,340 --> 00:19:16,160
Boring person, please!

325
00:19:17,250 --> 00:19:18,480
Please come in

326
00:19:18,480 --> 00:19:19,990
Who is it?

327
00:19:21,400 --> 00:19:23,150
Hello everybody

328
00:19:25,530 --> 00:19:26,710
I like you so much

329
00:19:28,160 --> 00:19:30,080
Michio-san   -It's Michio-chan!

330
00:19:30,080 --> 00:19:35,160
This dude is completely off the wall, no one can predict what he's going to do next

331
00:19:37,320 --> 00:19:41,780
I'm Michio from Tom Brown

332
00:19:41,780 --> 00:19:45,170
Wait a second...nope!

333
00:19:45,600 --> 00:19:47,160
Thank you for having me today

334
00:19:47,470 --> 00:19:48,620
Nice to meet you

335
00:19:47,490 --> 00:19:54,030
Fake TV Show Meeting

336
00:19:49,520 --> 00:19:50,710
This is a special program   -Yes

337
00:19:50,710 --> 00:19:51,730
What is your stunt?

338
00:19:51,730 --> 00:19:55,170
I can pull apart a pineapple with barehands

339
00:19:55,170 --> 00:19:58,220
I brought something else for you though

340
00:19:58,220 --> 00:20:00,220
This is for you   -Yes?

341
00:20:04,440 --> 00:20:06,390
Okay, I know about Documental...

342
00:20:06,390 --> 00:20:10,520
You win if you can pull out others' spinal cord, right?

343
00:20:10,520 --> 00:20:12,520
He's the most terrifying type of contestant

344
00:20:12,520 --> 00:20:15,540
Because you have no idea about what he will do

345
00:20:14,310 --> 00:20:17,540
The first appearance of M-1 Psycho Comedian

346
00:20:17,540 --> 00:20:19,190
What's in that bag?

347
00:20:19,190 --> 00:20:23,500
Maybe others will be disgusted, but I'm willing to do anything

348
00:20:23,500 --> 00:20:25,100
Fusion!

349
00:20:25,100 --> 00:20:27,100
I can thrust my face into vomits

350
00:20:27,100 --> 00:20:28,810
I can wash my hands with pee

351
00:20:28,810 --> 00:20:30,310
I feel sorry for other comedians

352
00:20:30,310 --> 00:20:34,720
But it is possible that the show may even be banned

353
00:20:34,980 --> 00:20:38,790
The Insane Penguin Man

354
00:20:38,790 --> 00:20:43,230
However, I've only seen Tom Brown as a comedy duo

355
00:20:43,230 --> 00:20:47,230
I wonder what he is like on his own

356
00:20:47,480 --> 00:20:50,240
I just have to go for broke

357
00:20:50,240 --> 00:20:54,180
I only have 1,000 yen left in my bank account

358
00:20:54,180 --> 00:20:56,550
And I had to borrow 1 million from my boss

359
00:20:56,550 --> 00:20:58,920
I want to leave a deep impression
and win the cash prize at the same time

360
00:20:58,920 --> 00:21:00,650
That's the ideal situation

361
00:21:00,650 --> 00:21:03,240
I'll make the wind blow

362
00:21:04,900 --> 00:21:06,960
What's in that bag?   -A human head?

363
00:21:06,960 --> 00:21:08,840
It's gonna be a big problem if that's a human head

364
00:21:08,840 --> 00:21:11,250
Well, this is actually...   -A human head, right?

365
00:21:12,070 --> 00:21:13,250
This is actually...

366
00:21:13,600 --> 00:21:16,220
This is a second bag   -Second bag?

367
00:21:16,220 --> 00:21:18,260
(He's already showing it?)

368
00:21:18,260 --> 00:21:19,620
Why don't you show it later?

369
00:21:19,620 --> 00:21:21,270
He's already showing it

370
00:21:21,270 --> 00:21:23,790
I'll definitely laugh if he showed it later

371
00:21:23,790 --> 00:21:25,560
That was quite funny

372
00:21:25,560 --> 00:21:28,260
There's still 6 more hours, dude

373
00:21:28,260 --> 00:21:30,630
It's not even started yet

374
00:21:30,630 --> 00:21:33,270
One more person left?   -Two more people

375
00:21:36,230 --> 00:21:37,160
No way!

376
00:21:37,160 --> 00:21:39,180
Wait a second, this is amazing   -Eh?!

377
00:21:39,180 --> 00:21:40,890
Come on...   -No, no, no way

378
00:21:40,890 --> 00:21:43,280
This is going to be awful   -Come on...

379
00:21:43,400 --> 00:21:45,940
There are people that I know and people that I don't know

380
00:21:45,940 --> 00:21:49,290
Of course, dude, that's usually the case

381
00:21:49,290 --> 00:21:51,290
Yes, I'm the one that you don't know   -Nice to meet you

382
00:21:51,700 --> 00:21:54,960
Hello, I'm Miyasako from Ameagari-Kesshitai

383
00:21:55,290 --> 00:21:58,190
I thought I will never get an offer again

384
00:21:58,190 --> 00:22:00,070
This is for you

385
00:22:00,070 --> 00:22:01,640
Seriously?

386
00:22:01,640 --> 00:22:02,630
It's for you

387
00:22:02,630 --> 00:22:04,920
For the second time?

388
00:22:04,920 --> 00:22:08,130
So he's joining this again for the second time

389
00:22:08,130 --> 00:22:14,370
Last time, he even had an erection for the contest

390
00:22:14,370 --> 00:22:19,660
So this time, it's probably about time for him to ejaculate

391
00:22:21,230 --> 00:22:25,170
All I had was an erection last time

392
00:22:25,170 --> 00:22:29,340
It has been a while since the last contest

393
00:22:29,340 --> 00:22:33,860
So I think I won't have an erection anymore

394
00:22:33,860 --> 00:22:37,340
Because I'm 50 and my body is deteriorating everyday

395
00:22:37,340 --> 00:22:42,940
He's a major comedian, and I would like to witness a major comedian winning

396
00:22:43,340 --> 00:22:46,290
The Desperate Off-white Comedian

397
00:22:48,320 --> 00:22:49,670
Oh gee

398
00:22:49,670 --> 00:22:51,360
9 people now

399
00:22:51,360 --> 00:22:56,420
It's not about the entrance fee, neither the 10 million cash prize

400
00:22:56,420 --> 00:22:59,360
I just don't want to get hurt

401
00:22:59,360 --> 00:23:02,920
Same as last time...

402
00:23:02,920 --> 00:23:12,020
I want to let out the insanity hiding inside of me

403
00:23:13,990 --> 00:23:18,490
Of course, Miyasako is the most senior comedian among them

404
00:23:18,490 --> 00:23:20,680
No girls yet, huh?   -Yeah

405
00:23:21,200 --> 00:23:25,390
You are already not interesting   -Why the heck?

406
00:23:25,390 --> 00:23:26,740
What are you talking about?

407
00:23:26,740 --> 00:23:27,820
What do you mean "already"?

408
00:23:27,820 --> 00:23:31,390
So here comes the last person

409
00:23:32,640 --> 00:23:34,240
And it's him...

410
00:23:34,240 --> 00:23:37,400
Everybody, prepare yourself, it's him

411
00:23:41,080 --> 00:23:43,090
Eh?   -No! No! No way!

412
00:23:43,090 --> 00:23:45,410
The emperor, here comes the emperor

413
00:23:45,600 --> 00:23:48,010
Hello, I'm Hollywood Zakoshisyoh

414
00:23:48,010 --> 00:23:49,420
I am so psyched up to be here!

415
00:23:49,420 --> 00:23:50,900
Two-time champion!

416
00:23:50,900 --> 00:23:52,760
I got to do this

417
00:23:55,840 --> 00:24:00,960
Moved to a new apartment with the cash prize from Documental

418
00:23:59,780 --> 00:24:01,320
Again?

419
00:24:01,320 --> 00:24:07,940
Everyone thinks that Zakoshi is a very strong player for Documental

420
00:24:07,940 --> 00:24:10,870
He's like "The Last Emperor" Fedor at one time

421
00:24:10,870 --> 00:24:14,220
One can totally feel his emperor-ness

422
00:24:14,220 --> 00:24:17,220
The Strongest Man In The World

423
00:24:17,220 --> 00:24:23,110
One in six billion

424
00:24:24,410 --> 00:24:27,850
He's strong in both attack and defense

425
00:24:27,850 --> 00:24:29,450
He's truly an impregnable wall

426
00:24:29,450 --> 00:24:32,450
I personally see him as the emperor

427
00:24:32,450 --> 00:24:37,040
I actually thought winners can't join anymore

428
00:24:37,040 --> 00:24:39,460
But here comes the invitation, and I'm like "Hooray!"

429
00:24:39,460 --> 00:24:43,460
The Super Aggressive Documentalist

430
00:24:43,610 --> 00:24:47,580
To be honest, I can even do this for 24 hours, not just 6 hours

431
00:24:47,580 --> 00:24:50,900
I think it's fair to say I'm a heaven-sent player for Documental

432
00:24:50,900 --> 00:24:52,450
Let's do this

433
00:24:52,450 --> 00:24:54,160
I don't want to do this...

434
00:24:54,160 --> 00:24:56,810
Let's do this again!

435
00:24:56,810 --> 00:25:00,370
The atmosphere is completely irrelevant here

436
00:25:00,370 --> 00:25:02,370
I want to surprise the world again

437
00:25:03,100 --> 00:25:06,400
It's very possible for him to win again

438
00:25:06,400 --> 00:25:10,410
If I'm joining again, then of course I'm aiming to win again

439
00:25:10,410 --> 00:25:11,940
I got to do this!

440
00:25:41,690 --> 00:25:43,980
Why is Miyasako-san coming again...

441
00:25:43,980 --> 00:25:46,300
Come on, you don't need to be even more popular

442
00:25:46,300 --> 00:25:48,550
You don't care about 10 million, right?   -Please quit

443
00:25:48,550 --> 00:25:52,500
I didn't expect Miyasako-san to join again

444
00:25:52,500 --> 00:25:54,250
I didn't expect to come back a second time too

445
00:25:54,250 --> 00:25:55,980
Then please reject the invitation

446
00:25:55,980 --> 00:26:00,200
I already have 10 million anyway   -Hey, dude!

447
00:26:00,200 --> 00:26:01,770
He's pissing me off...

448
00:26:01,770 --> 00:26:03,490
Everyone here wants the 10 million

449
00:26:03,490 --> 00:26:05,550
We are here because we want the 10 million

450
00:26:14,550 --> 00:26:17,310
So scary   -His face looks so scary

451
00:26:17,310 --> 00:26:18,750
What's going on?

452
00:26:18,750 --> 00:26:20,860
His muscles are popping out!

453
00:26:20,860 --> 00:26:22,130
So big!

454
00:26:22,130 --> 00:26:24,230
What happened to you, Matsumoto-san?

455
00:26:24,230 --> 00:26:25,740
His muscles are not balanced

456
00:26:25,740 --> 00:26:27,570
He's so strange today

457
00:26:29,770 --> 00:26:31,160
What was that?

458
00:26:31,160 --> 00:26:32,760
Everybody have a seat

459
00:26:32,760 --> 00:26:35,580
Is he showing off his muscles?   -No, I'm not

460
00:26:36,580 --> 00:26:38,830
Well, this is very interesting

461
00:26:38,830 --> 00:26:40,320
This is horrible   -Yes, it is

462
00:26:40,320 --> 00:26:42,750
These members are horrible

463
00:26:42,750 --> 00:26:45,540
Even for zoo animals, they get to have their own cages

464
00:26:45,540 --> 00:26:48,580
But now, completely different humans are shut in the same cage

465
00:26:48,580 --> 00:26:51,140
I actually thought Koyabu-san will not come

466
00:26:51,140 --> 00:26:52,970
I don't get this too

467
00:26:52,970 --> 00:26:55,060
He's the talking type of comedian

468
00:26:55,060 --> 00:26:59,510
I thought he'll just be attacking with talks too, but then he brought a huge bag with him

469
00:26:59,510 --> 00:27:00,540
Yeah, you're right

470
00:27:00,540 --> 00:27:05,090
This man over here, I call him the emperor, Zakoshi

471
00:27:05,090 --> 00:27:07,110
He's an impregnable wall

472
00:27:07,110 --> 00:27:09,110
Thank you very much   -Who can stop him?

473
00:27:09,110 --> 00:27:12,030
He's a formidable enemy, someone have to stop him

474
00:27:12,620 --> 00:27:14,340
Shall I take it again?

475
00:27:14,340 --> 00:27:15,720
Another 10 million?

476
00:27:15,720 --> 00:27:17,180
No one has ever done that yet

477
00:27:17,180 --> 00:27:18,950
He is very strong indeed

478
00:27:18,950 --> 00:27:23,760
We all know about the rules, right?   -Yes

479
00:27:24,380 --> 00:27:26,320
So there are three cards

480
00:27:26,320 --> 00:27:29,400
And if you get a red card, then you're out

481
00:27:30,980 --> 00:27:34,320
Well, 1 million is nothing to you guys, right?

482
00:27:34,320 --> 00:27:36,320
No, no, no!

483
00:27:36,320 --> 00:27:38,390
No way!   -What are you talking about?

484
00:27:38,390 --> 00:27:40,390
Yeah, it's nothing to me

485
00:27:40,390 --> 00:27:41,690
This man over here...

486
00:27:41,690 --> 00:27:44,180
This man says it's nothing to him again, he's a man of principle

487
00:27:44,180 --> 00:27:47,330
Yeah right, honestly, we all have many millions

488
00:27:47,330 --> 00:27:48,590
We are all equally rich

489
00:27:48,590 --> 00:27:50,520
No we're not   -Not at all

490
00:27:50,520 --> 00:27:52,130
You're exceptionally rich

491
00:27:52,130 --> 00:27:54,060
We are all the same   -You're exceptional

492
00:27:54,060 --> 00:27:55,400
He's the man of exception

493
00:27:55,400 --> 00:27:56,600
Eh?   -The man of exception?

494
00:27:56,600 --> 00:27:57,390
Dude...

495
00:27:57,390 --> 00:27:59,660
Do you even think you can win?

496
00:28:00,580 --> 00:28:02,480
Then why the heck did you invite me?

497
00:28:02,480 --> 00:28:04,590
Wait a second, let me ask this again

498
00:28:04,590 --> 00:28:06,590
Why the heck did you invite me?

499
00:28:06,590 --> 00:28:08,040
No one knows what will happen here

500
00:28:08,040 --> 00:28:10,440
This is like a type of combat sport

501
00:28:10,440 --> 00:28:12,050
Yeah, you're right

502
00:28:12,460 --> 00:28:14,800
I'll seize...I mean collect your 1 million now   -Seize?

503
00:28:16,140 --> 00:28:17,620
One million is a lot...

504
00:28:17,620 --> 00:28:20,070
Well, yes, I know, you're right

505
00:28:21,830 --> 00:28:24,360
But I'm giving out one million too

506
00:28:24,360 --> 00:28:27,350
Yeah, that's true

507
00:28:27,350 --> 00:28:29,810
Hey, Koyabu...

508
00:28:29,810 --> 00:28:33,860
This looks like the money in casino   -Yes, you're right

509
00:28:34,280 --> 00:28:36,980
I'll trust you guys with this. One million, right?

510
00:28:36,980 --> 00:28:38,680
Yes, one million

511
00:28:38,680 --> 00:28:40,680
Wow, so scary!

512
00:28:42,820 --> 00:28:45,110
Amazing!   -That's a lot of money

513
00:28:45,110 --> 00:28:46,840
This is so graphic

514
00:28:46,840 --> 00:28:48,860
It really is!   -This is nothing to Seiya, right?

515
00:28:48,860 --> 00:28:51,840
No, I haven't received the cash prize from M-1 yet, so...

516
00:28:51,840 --> 00:28:54,270
You haven't received it yet?   -No, not yet

517
00:28:54,270 --> 00:28:57,820
Maybe Seiya can get this one too, he's on fire recently

518
00:28:57,820 --> 00:29:00,000
If Seiya can be like how he was during M-1

519
00:29:00,000 --> 00:29:00,570
Yeah right

520
00:29:00,570 --> 00:29:03,190
If he's like how he was during R-1 then that's the worst   -Matsumoto-san...

521
00:29:03,190 --> 00:29:06,410
I got trolled so hard by internet because you said that

522
00:29:07,430 --> 00:29:14,150
And with this, you'll only get 9 millions, so...

523
00:29:14,150 --> 00:29:17,280
I'll add this...   -Matsumoto-san's one million!

524
00:29:17,280 --> 00:29:19,220
This adds up to 10 million

525
00:29:19,220 --> 00:29:20,960
11 million   -Yes

526
00:29:20,960 --> 00:29:22,430
Are you guys ready?

527
00:29:22,430 --> 00:29:23,660
Ready?   -Yes

528
00:29:23,660 --> 00:29:25,740
The contest starts after I leave

529
00:29:27,250 --> 00:29:29,260
Wow! This is terrifying!

530
00:29:29,940 --> 00:29:32,230
I probably shouldn't say this, but...

531
00:29:32,230 --> 00:29:36,730
Those that don't attack and are not interesting...

532
00:29:36,730 --> 00:29:39,760
Will get trolled super hard by internet

533
00:29:39,760 --> 00:29:41,760
Why are you saying that now?

534
00:29:41,760 --> 00:29:44,780
They will be nastily trolled

535
00:29:44,780 --> 00:29:47,250
Ahh, it's about to start

536
00:29:47,250 --> 00:29:49,770
This is my first time   -This is my first time too

537
00:29:49,770 --> 00:29:51,770
Good luck guys   -Thank you very much

538
00:29:51,770 --> 00:29:53,510
Thank you very much

539
00:29:53,510 --> 00:29:55,510
Whao, it's about to start!

540
00:29:56,700 --> 00:29:59,330
Who's taking part for the first time?

541
00:29:59,930 --> 00:30:00,590
4 people

542
00:30:00,590 --> 00:30:02,020
4 people are taking part for the first time

543
00:30:02,020 --> 00:30:03,780
It's not started yet, right?   -Yeah, not yet

544
00:30:03,780 --> 00:30:04,770
I need to go pee

545
00:30:04,770 --> 00:30:06,870
Come on, you're trying to prepare something, right?

546
00:30:06,870 --> 00:30:08,630
No, no, it's not started yet

547
00:30:08,630 --> 00:30:11,380
-Don't rush, there's plenty of time
-No dude, I really need to go pee

548
00:30:11,380 --> 00:30:13,580
Let's start now

549
00:30:13,580 --> 00:30:15,350
Documental

550
00:30:15,350 --> 00:30:16,950
Start!

551
00:30:19,510 --> 00:30:21,250
It started   -Come on!

552
00:30:22,060 --> 00:30:24,680
I'll do this just in case

553
00:30:24,930 --> 00:30:26,060
For what?   -Just in case

554
00:30:26,060 --> 00:30:27,800
Just in case for what?

555
00:30:28,670 --> 00:30:29,810
Ciao

556
00:30:30,080 --> 00:30:31,350
What the heck is that just in case for?

557
00:30:31,350 --> 00:30:32,530
Isn't he laughing?

558
00:30:32,530 --> 00:30:33,640
He's laughing!   -Yeah

559
00:30:33,640 --> 00:30:34,650
I didn't laugh, that's just Ciao

560
00:30:34,650 --> 00:30:36,300
That counts as well   -Yeah, exactly

561
00:30:36,300 --> 00:30:37,280
Hey no, that's Ciao

562
00:30:37,280 --> 00:30:39,460
What do you mean just in case...   -Do it again

563
00:30:39,460 --> 00:30:41,370
He was indeed smiling

564
00:30:41,370 --> 00:30:43,700
You're laughing!   -You're out

565
00:30:43,700 --> 00:30:44,710
That's Ciao!   -You're laughing

566
00:30:44,710 --> 00:30:46,620
This needs further deliberation, honestly

567
00:30:46,620 --> 00:30:48,560
Why the heck?   -You're indeed laughing!

568
00:30:48,560 --> 00:30:50,490
You can't laugh even if you're talking

569
00:30:50,490 --> 00:30:52,110
No way, that's just Ciao

570
00:30:52,110 --> 00:30:53,090
(Well, yeah...)

571
00:30:53,090 --> 00:30:53,700
That's just Ciao!

572
00:30:53,700 --> 00:30:54,850
Do it again

573
00:30:54,850 --> 00:30:55,500
Ciao

574
00:30:55,500 --> 00:30:56,200
You're laughing

575
00:30:59,350 --> 00:31:00,070
Ikko-san

576
00:31:00,070 --> 00:31:01,130
Why the heck?

577
00:31:01,130 --> 00:31:02,420
Why did you do that?

578
00:31:02,420 --> 00:31:03,210
It's not even relevant

579
00:31:03,210 --> 00:31:05,630
Koyabu...Koyabu...Koyabu!

580
00:31:03,800 --> 00:31:04,500
Irrelevant with Ciao

581
00:31:05,970 --> 00:31:08,910
Koyabu is close, Koyabu is very close!

582
00:31:08,910 --> 00:31:11,170
No one will laugh at it, right?

583
00:31:11,170 --> 00:31:13,190
No one will laugh at Ciao, right? I'll go get changed

584
00:31:13,190 --> 00:31:15,820
No, no one will laugh at Ciao

585
00:31:15,820 --> 00:31:17,400
You're the one who's laughing

586
00:31:17,400 --> 00:31:18,780
So no one will laugh, right?

587
00:31:18,780 --> 00:31:19,860
No one will laugh

588
00:31:19,860 --> 00:31:21,590
No will laugh? Not at Ciao?   -Nope

589
00:31:21,590 --> 00:31:23,630
Well, actually, maybe I'll laugh

590
00:31:23,630 --> 00:31:24,650
Eh?   -Laugh at Ciao?

591
00:31:24,650 --> 00:31:26,300
I can't leave if you say that, dude

592
00:31:26,300 --> 00:31:27,860
Please do it again

593
00:31:28,450 --> 00:31:29,150
Ciao

594
00:31:29,410 --> 00:31:30,860
Is he laughing?   -His face is laughing

595
00:31:30,860 --> 00:31:33,600
My heart is not laughing though

596
00:31:33,600 --> 00:31:36,470
What the heck do you mean your heart is not laughing?   -That's cheap

597
00:31:36,470 --> 00:31:37,340
You heart is not laughing?

598
00:31:37,340 --> 00:31:39,080
Well, just let him get away with it   -Exactly

599
00:31:39,080 --> 00:31:40,710
Dude, if I can't even perform gags, then...

600
00:31:40,710 --> 00:31:42,470
Was that even a gag?

601
00:31:42,470 --> 00:31:43,880
He's trying to do something

602
00:31:43,880 --> 00:31:47,040
*Furuhata Ninzaburo is a police detective drama

603
00:31:43,880 --> 00:31:47,040
I'm Furuhata

604
00:31:47,040 --> 00:31:49,420
I am the murderer

605
00:31:49,420 --> 00:31:50,830
This is...

606
00:31:50,830 --> 00:31:51,900
He's the suspect?

607
00:31:51,900 --> 00:31:53,900
Nikaku-san?

608
00:31:51,900 --> 00:31:58,410
*Shouhukutei-Nikaku is one of the most senior comedian in Yoshimoto

609
00:31:54,940 --> 00:31:58,410
Hey, I'm Shouhukutei-Nikaku

610
00:31:58,410 --> 00:32:00,110
The quality of this imitation is very high

611
00:32:00,110 --> 00:32:01,900
Tamuken   -Yes?

612
00:32:01,900 --> 00:32:03,900
Quit comedy now

613
00:32:04,700 --> 00:32:09,910
Not even a single person in Yoshimoto admires you

614
00:32:11,100 --> 00:32:12,490
Why would you say something like that to me?

615
00:32:12,490 --> 00:32:13,920
Stop it, Seiya

616
00:32:14,680 --> 00:32:15,910
Miyasako

617
00:32:17,260 --> 00:32:17,920
Yes, Shisho

618
00:32:18,900 --> 00:32:20,350
For 10 years...

619
00:32:20,350 --> 00:32:21,560
Long time no see

620
00:32:21,560 --> 00:32:24,580
You've always been telling safe jokes that everyone can tell

621
00:32:24,580 --> 00:32:27,000
Seiya...

622
00:32:27,000 --> 00:32:28,380
He's pissing me off

623
00:32:28,380 --> 00:32:30,770
Your jokes are always 50 points

624
00:32:30,770 --> 00:32:32,870
That's not true, stop it

625
00:32:32,870 --> 00:32:34,580
Anyone with a mouth can do that

626
00:32:34,580 --> 00:32:36,420
That's completely untrue

627
00:32:36,420 --> 00:32:39,590
Shisho won't say that   -Nikaku-shisho definitely won't say that

628
00:32:39,590 --> 00:32:41,940
Koyabu

629
00:32:42,070 --> 00:32:44,620
All you got is a loud voice

630
00:32:45,120 --> 00:32:46,860
I don't think so...

631
00:32:46,860 --> 00:32:47,440
Well...

632
00:32:47,440 --> 00:32:49,440
Your voice and your face

633
00:32:49,440 --> 00:32:50,480
That's not true

634
00:32:50,480 --> 00:32:52,480
I've never been told about that though

635
00:32:52,480 --> 00:32:54,930
That attitude is no good to Yoshimoto

636
00:32:54,930 --> 00:32:56,720
Goto   -Yes?

637
00:32:56,720 --> 00:32:59,760
Honestly, you're just simply untalented

638
00:32:59,760 --> 00:33:01,830
You're very lucky to be able to come this far

639
00:33:01,830 --> 00:33:07,220
And yet, you think you've done this with your own effort

640
00:33:07,220 --> 00:33:09,220
That's seriously pathetic, so please stop!

641
00:33:09,220 --> 00:33:11,730
You don't even sound like Shisho for the last bit

642
00:33:11,730 --> 00:33:13,170
Stop it, Seiya!

643
00:33:13,170 --> 00:33:15,980
You're just talking bad about him for the last bit

644
00:33:16,530 --> 00:33:19,980
*Fujimon blew up at his junior, Shiatsuyaro, because Shiatsuyaro imitated Kyojin-shisho and talked bad about Fujimon

645
00:33:16,530 --> 00:33:19,980
By the way, that's exactly why Fujimon blew up at Shiatsuyaro

646
00:33:21,420 --> 00:33:22,530
Yeah, that happened

647
00:33:22,530 --> 00:33:25,180
Eh?   -He let out a "Kee" sound?

648
00:33:25,180 --> 00:33:27,990
That's probably the sound of him laughing, right?

649
00:33:27,990 --> 00:33:28,940
Did you laugh?

650
00:33:33,990 --> 00:33:34,890
Good, take him down

651
00:33:41,110 --> 00:33:43,370
Don't let out sounds as if you're doing Judo

652
00:33:44,050 --> 00:33:45,410
That one just now doesn't count?

653
00:33:45,410 --> 00:33:46,960
He completely laughed

654
00:33:46,960 --> 00:33:48,450
He laughed out loud

655
00:33:48,450 --> 00:33:50,360
I remembered something about Nigaku-shisho

656
00:33:50,360 --> 00:33:51,440
Please tell us about it

657
00:33:51,440 --> 00:33:53,140
We were on the same stage in Nagoya before

658
00:33:53,140 --> 00:33:54,790
*Debayashi is a kind of kabuki music played on a stage by performers.

659
00:33:53,140 --> 00:33:54,790
Nigaku-shisho was going to perform Debayashi

660
00:33:54,790 --> 00:33:56,570
Since Nigaku-shisho got his own room to rest

661
00:33:56,570 --> 00:33:59,030
He walked towards the stage very slowly on his own

662
00:33:59,030 --> 00:34:02,030
And he arrived only after the show ended

663
00:34:02,570 --> 00:34:03,510
Nigaku-shisho...

664
00:34:04,300 --> 00:34:07,080
He's slow paced   -It takes time for him to walk

665
00:34:07,080 --> 00:34:09,080
He probably don't have enough stamina

666
00:34:09,730 --> 00:34:11,460
He was talking with Budan-shisho

667
00:34:11,830 --> 00:34:14,030
Oh, so that's why

668
00:34:14,030 --> 00:34:17,520
Nigaku said to me "your throat is so weak"

669
00:34:17,520 --> 00:34:20,850
"You have to cure your throat if you want to be a comedian"

670
00:34:21,520 --> 00:34:24,050
Then I told him I had vocal cord polyp surgery for twice

671
00:34:24,050 --> 00:34:26,370
And I asked "how many times did you have that surgery?"

672
00:34:26,370 --> 00:34:29,610
And he answered "24 times"   -That's a lot!

673
00:34:29,610 --> 00:34:30,420
Too much

674
00:34:30,420 --> 00:34:32,720
Probably every year

675
00:34:32,720 --> 00:34:34,720
He's a legend

676
00:34:34,720 --> 00:34:36,690
So even him needs to have it for so many times

677
00:34:36,690 --> 00:34:39,030
He doesn't have any polyp left by now, huh?

678
00:34:39,030 --> 00:34:42,510
(Everyone is trying to hold back)

679
00:34:42,510 --> 00:34:43,950
(Very close)

680
00:34:47,240 --> 00:34:49,690
(Everyone is in danger)

681
00:34:49,690 --> 00:34:52,860
I think he almost laughed at that Shiatsuyaro incident

682
00:34:53,540 --> 00:34:55,270
Yeah, talk more about Shiatsuyaro

683
00:34:55,270 --> 00:34:57,660
It's no good to talk bad about others

684
00:34:57,660 --> 00:34:59,040
Fujimon blew up at him

685
00:34:59,040 --> 00:35:01,040
Why? What happened?

686
00:35:04,920 --> 00:35:05,970
What the heck is that?

687
00:35:05,970 --> 00:35:07,680
No, come on, just tell us what happened

688
00:35:07,680 --> 00:35:08,700
Goto-san, you can say it

689
00:35:08,700 --> 00:35:13,340
I don't want to talk bad about Shiatsuyaro-san, honestly

690
00:35:13,340 --> 00:35:15,690
No, we're just asking you what happened?

691
00:35:15,690 --> 00:35:16,660
I think...

692
00:35:16,660 --> 00:35:17,950
He raped someone?

693
00:35:17,950 --> 00:35:18,620
No way...

694
00:35:18,620 --> 00:35:20,100
Am I wrong?

695
00:35:20,480 --> 00:35:21,790
Rape?

696
00:35:24,550 --> 00:35:25,470
Koyabu...

697
00:35:25,470 --> 00:35:27,470
No way, that's not right   -I don't remember

698
00:35:27,470 --> 00:35:29,260
(That's inappropriate)
You're completely wrong

699
00:35:29,260 --> 00:35:30,420
Kyojin-shisho...

700
00:35:30,420 --> 00:35:32,190
Kyojin-shisho?   -Yeah

701
00:35:32,190 --> 00:35:36,390
Well yeah, he imitated Kyojin-shisho and said something inappropriate

702
00:35:36,390 --> 00:35:38,710
Yeah, that's right

703
00:35:38,710 --> 00:35:40,260
He definitely didn't rape anyone   -Exactly

704
00:35:40,260 --> 00:35:40,820
Seiya...

705
00:35:40,820 --> 00:35:42,820
That was completely wrong   -Seiya...

706
00:35:42,820 --> 00:35:44,490
Are you laughing?   -No, I'm not

707
00:35:44,490 --> 00:35:46,120
You were laughing for many times already

708
00:35:46,120 --> 00:35:48,060
That's the same for you, Goto-san!

709
00:35:48,060 --> 00:35:49,350
He's talking so loudly now

710
00:35:49,350 --> 00:35:51,640
No, I didn't laugh at all

711
00:35:51,640 --> 00:35:53,000
Seiya, that's inappropriate, honestly

712
00:35:53,000 --> 00:35:54,800
Do I need to judge myself for this?

713
00:35:54,800 --> 00:35:56,030
Do I need to say like "I laughed"?

714
00:35:56,030 --> 00:35:58,140
No, of course not   -Exactly, so don't blame me

715
00:35:58,140 --> 00:36:00,140
He's about to laugh, huh?

716
00:36:00,440 --> 00:36:02,150
Shall I do the Hazuki imitation now?

717
00:36:00,440 --> 00:36:05,470
*Zakoshi is imitating the Hazuki magnifying glasses CM, which is endorsed by Watanabe Ken. This CM ended up being very popular and got made fun of for Ken's overly exaggerated performance.
*Full CM: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LuVh2zLej3Q

718
00:36:02,290 --> 00:36:04,140
What is that?   -Here it comes

719
00:36:04,140 --> 00:36:05,470
They kind of look alike

720
00:36:05,820 --> 00:36:07,470
Nowadays, the texts are all...

721
00:36:07,470 --> 00:36:10,150
SO DAMN SMALL!!!

722
00:36:11,270 --> 00:36:12,780
But if you wear the Hazuki glasses

723
00:36:12,780 --> 00:36:14,780
The world changes

724
00:36:14,780 --> 00:36:16,670
Everything looks bigger!

725
00:36:18,400 --> 00:36:22,160
Please stop it Seiya, we're being hit by his scattergun too

726
00:36:22,160 --> 00:36:23,410
Something exploded, huh?

727
00:36:23,410 --> 00:36:24,580
I'll go get changed, okay?

728
00:36:24,580 --> 00:36:27,540
What was that Ciao just now?

729
00:36:27,540 --> 00:36:29,540
Just in case someone will laugh at it

730
00:36:29,540 --> 00:36:34,170
So you let out all of your Ciao already, right?   -Yeah

731
00:36:34,170 --> 00:36:36,170
I'll go get changed then   -Yeah, sure

732
00:36:36,430 --> 00:36:37,860
Everyone agrees?   -Yes

733
00:36:37,860 --> 00:36:39,180
Your skin is full of blemishes

734
00:36:39,180 --> 00:36:41,660
What happened to you?

735
00:36:41,660 --> 00:36:42,620
It's full of blemishes

736
00:36:42,620 --> 00:36:46,180
I don't like seniors with blemishes...   -So cold!

737
00:36:46,750 --> 00:36:48,190
So cold...

738
00:36:48,640 --> 00:36:50,180
Yeah, my body gets cold easily

739
00:36:51,640 --> 00:36:54,190
*Miyasako was diagnosed with stomach cancer in 2012 and removed two-thirds of the stomach

740
00:36:51,640 --> 00:36:54,190
Because I had stomach cancer

741
00:36:58,790 --> 00:37:00,020
He laughed?

742
00:37:00,020 --> 00:37:01,900
He let out a "ku" sound   -Yeah, I heard that

743
00:37:02,940 --> 00:37:03,900
Hooray!

744
00:37:03,900 --> 00:37:06,200
It's definitely Tamura-san

745
00:37:06,200 --> 00:37:09,110
He totally laughed

746
00:37:09,920 --> 00:37:11,130
Eh? It's me?

747
00:37:11,230 --> 00:37:13,170
He bursted out laughing   -Yeah, he did

748
00:37:13,170 --> 00:37:14,620
He was like "ku"

749
00:37:14,620 --> 00:37:17,170
Hooray!   -That one was close

750
00:37:17,170 --> 00:37:18,100
That one was so close

751
00:37:18,100 --> 00:37:20,560
He said "ku", right?   -Yes, he did

752
00:37:20,560 --> 00:37:22,830
Yes I did, but please look at my face

753
00:37:22,830 --> 00:37:24,100
My face wasn't laughing at all

754
00:37:24,100 --> 00:37:25,900
Yeah, all I heard was "ku"

755
00:37:25,900 --> 00:37:27,330
The camera did record his face

756
00:37:27,330 --> 00:37:29,370
But there were a lot of monitors in front of me

757
00:37:29,370 --> 00:37:31,300
So I missed that one

758
00:37:31,300 --> 00:37:33,480
Let's take a look   -Yes, let's confirm it

759
00:37:33,480 --> 00:37:34,510
Let's confirm it

760
00:37:35,890 --> 00:37:37,230
So cold

761
00:37:37,700 --> 00:37:39,440
Yeah, my body gets cold easily

762
00:37:39,440 --> 00:37:41,440
Because I had stomach cancer

763
00:37:45,220 --> 00:37:46,470
You were laughing, dude!

764
00:37:46,470 --> 00:37:48,600
You were completely laughing, dude!

765
00:37:48,600 --> 00:37:51,430
What the heck is wrong with this dude?!

766
00:37:51,430 --> 00:37:53,430
He laughed at others' pain

767
00:37:53,430 --> 00:37:55,020
You're the worst!   -That's so mean

768
00:37:55,020 --> 00:37:58,260
But wait, you're the one who tried to make him laugh at your pain

769
00:37:58,260 --> 00:38:00,700
You're even worse

770
00:38:00,700 --> 00:38:02,260
Although you're the sufferer

771
00:38:05,070 --> 00:38:06,770
No! No way! I don't want this!

772
00:38:07,380 --> 00:38:08,980
Anyway, I'll give you this one

773
00:38:08,980 --> 00:38:10,340
Or maybe this one?   -No, no, no...

774
00:38:10,340 --> 00:38:12,180
The yellow one   -Okay, okay

775
00:38:12,180 --> 00:38:14,270
Yellow, yellow

776
00:38:15,930 --> 00:38:17,960
Seiya laughed as well   -No, we're different

777
00:38:17,960 --> 00:38:20,790
He definitely laughed   -Well, well, yeah, I know

778
00:38:21,130 --> 00:38:23,190
It's not good to make those weird faces

779
00:38:23,190 --> 00:38:24,680
Sorry, I won't do it again

780
00:38:24,680 --> 00:38:27,140
But since the length of his career is remarkably longer than me, so please forgive me

781
00:38:27,480 --> 00:38:29,380
No way, dude!

782
00:38:29,380 --> 00:38:32,880
At the moment you won M-1, the difference in career length doesn't matter anymore

783
00:38:32,880 --> 00:38:35,230
You've went through Nichome's times of storm!*

784
00:38:32,880 --> 00:38:36,360
*Shinjuku Nichome was known as the noisiest and most dangerous ward in Tokyo, housing the world's highest concentration of gay bars and nightclubs

785
00:38:35,230 --> 00:38:36,360
Times of storm?

786
00:38:36,360 --> 00:38:38,300
It was already quite peaceful in my days

787
00:38:40,680 --> 00:38:42,630
Oh gee, it's gonna be tough this time

788
00:38:42,630 --> 00:38:44,220
Only ten minutes have passed?!

789
00:38:44,220 --> 00:38:46,220
The tempo is so fast!

790
00:38:46,220 --> 00:38:48,730
We got off to a fast start this time

791
00:38:49,170 --> 00:38:50,610
Maybe it's gonna end earlier?

792
00:38:50,610 --> 00:38:53,110
Come on...seriously, I mean seriously

793
00:38:53,110 --> 00:38:54,260
Let's do this properly

794
00:38:54,260 --> 00:38:56,660
Yeah, you're right

795
00:38:56,660 --> 00:38:59,590
Let's stop camouflaging

796
00:38:59,590 --> 00:39:00,530
Choose your side

797
00:39:00,530 --> 00:39:03,130
Either laugh or hold back

798
00:39:03,130 --> 00:39:04,770
Ok, let's start immediately

799
00:39:06,320 --> 00:39:07,520
It started again

800
00:39:07,520 --> 00:39:09,270
No one will laugh at it

801
00:39:09,270 --> 00:39:11,330
Even I won't laugh at it, of course no one else will!

802
00:39:11,330 --> 00:39:13,820
He's torn between doing or stopping his Ciao

803
00:39:14,330 --> 00:39:16,240
Eh? Just now?

804
00:39:16,240 --> 00:39:18,310
He laughed naturally   -And if the alarm rings...

805
00:39:19,140 --> 00:39:21,140
I knew it!

806
00:39:22,340 --> 00:39:24,160
He totally laughed

807
00:39:24,160 --> 00:39:26,160
So naturally

808
00:39:26,160 --> 00:39:28,240
No, wait a second...

809
00:39:28,240 --> 00:39:31,030
If even that counts as laughing...

810
00:39:31,030 --> 00:39:33,270
You were too relaxed

811
00:39:33,270 --> 00:39:35,770
I didn't see that clearly too, was that you Kato?

812
00:39:35,770 --> 00:39:37,530
Yes, it's Kato-san   -No, no, it's not me

813
00:39:37,530 --> 00:39:39,110
All I said was "Kee"

814
00:39:39,110 --> 00:39:40,150
Which means you laughed

815
00:39:40,150 --> 00:39:41,000
What is a "Kee"?

816
00:39:41,000 --> 00:39:42,580
What made you laugh anyway?

817
00:39:42,580 --> 00:39:44,470
No, no, I didn't laugh

818
00:39:44,470 --> 00:39:44,990
Really?

819
00:39:44,990 --> 00:39:48,680
Let's take a look   -Yeah, we'll see

820
00:39:49,110 --> 00:39:52,270
I'm sure that one of the camera recorded him   -I was just breathing

821
00:39:52,920 --> 00:39:54,690
No one will laugh at it

822
00:39:54,690 --> 00:39:56,770
Even I won't laugh at it, of course no one else will!

823
00:39:56,770 --> 00:39:59,190
He's torn between doing or stopping his Ciao

824
00:39:59,190 --> 00:40:00,840
Eh? Just now?

825
00:40:01,910 --> 00:40:04,230
You totally laughed!

826
00:40:04,880 --> 00:40:05,860
That's definitely out!

827
00:40:05,860 --> 00:40:07,580
Wait a second...

828
00:40:07,580 --> 00:40:09,770
That's completely out!

829
00:40:09,770 --> 00:40:11,860
That one should even be given an orange card

830
00:40:11,860 --> 00:40:14,100
What were you laughing at?   -What's so funny?

831
00:40:14,480 --> 00:40:15,370
Well...

832
00:40:15,370 --> 00:40:17,100
Nothing was funny, but I thought...

833
00:40:17,100 --> 00:40:19,220
"For god's sake, how long is he going to talk about Ciao?"

834
00:40:19,220 --> 00:40:21,310
So I took a deep unsteady breath

835
00:40:21,310 --> 00:40:23,600
So it's my point, I scored one point

836
00:40:23,600 --> 00:40:24,850
I scored one point, right?

837
00:40:25,430 --> 00:40:26,820
Well...

838
00:40:26,820 --> 00:40:28,820
I have to give you a yellow card for this

839
00:40:28,820 --> 00:40:31,160
This one came so fast

840
00:40:32,530 --> 00:40:34,420
I have to pull myself together

841
00:40:34,420 --> 00:40:38,490
This one is probably the fastest one ever

842
00:40:39,010 --> 00:40:42,880
I sat on my chair for just one small moment
