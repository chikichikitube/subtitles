[Subbed by Thanos-no-Tsukai
Thanks For Watching!]

2
00:00:16,330 --> 00:00:19,670
We got them all together... That we sure did.

3
00:00:22,470 --> 00:00:25,910
And we already had plenty of comedians in previous seasons.

4
00:00:26,310 --> 00:00:30,810
So I wanted to have a clean break here.

5
00:00:34,750 --> 00:00:40,660
Honestly, Ikemental and Joshimental really brought the whole package together.

6
00:00:40,960 --> 00:00:46,900
From here on out, I am thinking of expanding the range of our guests.

7
00:00:47,000 --> 00:00:50,970
I mean, the participants just have to be human.

8
00:00:51,270 --> 00:00:55,040
As long as they're human they can participate.

9
00:00:55,840 --> 00:00:56,370
Hey!

10
00:00:57,470 --> 00:00:58,280
Are you listening to me?

11
00:01:21,930 --> 00:01:27,000
In spring, I tried planting some spinach seeds given to me by an old gentleman in the neighborhood.

12
00:01:27,470 --> 00:01:30,010
But some unknown weeds came sprouting out.

13
00:01:32,010 --> 00:01:33,810
I tried making some Hitashi with it...
(EN: 1)

14
00:01:34,680 --> 00:01:36,750
And it tasted like nothing I've ever had before.

15
00:01:37,410 --> 00:01:38,950
I wonder... What was that?

16
00:01:42,090 --> 00:01:47,590
With this, we have finally decided to host "Documental Unlimited".

17
00:01:48,330 --> 00:01:52,060
Up until last season we only had comedians participate.

18
00:01:52,330 --> 00:01:58,340
But this time around we have invited people from all walks of life.
There are no limits.

19
00:01:59,000 --> 00:02:03,810
We have prepared the 10 million Yen, and we wait for your arrival.

20
00:02:03,870 --> 00:02:08,480
I hope your courageous participation will lead to fruitful results.

21
00:02:09,050 --> 00:02:11,050
Hitoshi Matsumoto.

22
00:02:12,820 --> 00:02:14,120
-Hello, welcome!
-Thank you for having us!

23
00:02:14,520 --> 00:02:15,550
Please take care of me today.

24
00:02:15,550 --> 00:02:16,490
Thank you for having us.
Please take care of me today.

25
00:02:16,490 --> 00:02:17,190
Thank you for having us.

26
00:02:17,690 --> 00:02:20,060
So we've changed up the formula this time around.

27
00:02:20,260 --> 00:02:22,690
We also stopped the whole "bring your own million Yen" spiel.

28
00:02:22,690 --> 00:02:23,190
-What?
-Really?

29
00:02:23,390 --> 00:02:26,130
Now, we will just give you the 10 million if you win.

30
00:02:26,130 --> 00:02:26,430
That's so nice!
Now, we will just give you the 10 million if you win.

31
00:02:26,430 --> 00:02:27,100
That's so nice!

32
00:02:27,130 --> 00:02:28,400
I'm so jealous!

33
00:02:28,430 --> 00:02:30,870
We can avoid all that trouble with the bank, you know?

34
00:02:32,170 --> 00:02:33,100
Totally.

35
00:02:33,340 --> 00:02:37,310
I'm actually pretty excited, or should I say, nervous?

36
00:02:38,880 --> 00:02:40,680
I'm full of expectations today.

37
00:02:41,050 --> 00:02:43,350
It's been a while since I've felt this way.

38
00:02:43,350 --> 00:02:43,750
Right, they might not play well off of each other.
It's been a while since I've felt this way.

39
00:02:43,750 --> 00:02:44,950
Right, they might not play well off of each other.

40
00:02:44,950 --> 00:02:45,850
-Oh, right.
-Totally.
Right, they might not play well off of each other.

41
00:02:45,850 --> 00:02:47,220
-Oh, right.
-Totally.

42
00:03:02,930 --> 00:03:03,230
Here they come.

43
00:03:04,030 --> 00:03:04,300
Yes.

44
00:03:08,340 --> 00:03:09,340
Oh, I see.

45
00:03:11,240 --> 00:03:12,340
It's Yusuke.

46
00:03:12,480 --> 00:03:14,140
-It's Kamiji!
-Right, Kamiji.

47
00:03:14,340 --> 00:03:15,680
Thank you for having me!

48
00:03:18,780 --> 00:03:20,020
I'm Yusuke Kamiji. (EN: 2)

49
00:03:20,150 --> 00:03:22,250
I'm an actor, singer, celebrity...

50
00:03:22,590 --> 00:03:25,220
I don't even know what I do anymore, but I'm trying my best.

51
00:03:26,960 --> 00:03:27,860
Excuse me.

52
00:03:30,330 --> 00:03:31,400
Good morning!

53
00:03:31,900 --> 00:03:32,560
Good morning!

54
00:03:33,130 --> 00:03:34,300
Here you go.

55
00:03:35,570 --> 00:03:36,370
I've been watching!

56
00:03:36,770 --> 00:03:41,640
Honestly, I secretly wanted to be picked.

57
00:03:42,710 --> 00:03:46,480
In his case, he's very motivated.

58
00:03:46,480 --> 00:03:49,610
He's an extremely motivated individual.

59
00:03:49,810 --> 00:03:53,420
I'd like to say he'll come pretty well prepared.

60
00:03:53,620 --> 00:03:55,620
Most of all, I want to wear the jacket.

61
00:03:55,790 --> 00:03:56,550
I want it so bad.

62
00:03:57,120 --> 00:03:59,090
I'm here with the full intention of winning.

63
00:04:00,220 --> 00:04:04,530
But he's used to variety shows.
After all, he's been trained by Shinsuke. (EN: 3)

64
00:04:05,130 --> 00:04:08,600
I think he'll do good.

65
00:04:12,400 --> 00:04:18,280
I was a catcher at Yokohama High School's baseball club, and we were pretty good.

66
00:04:18,740 --> 00:04:22,280
If you think about it, the catcher is like the team's director.

67
00:04:22,580 --> 00:04:28,020
So I want to approach this by looking for openings.

68
00:04:31,590 --> 00:04:33,120
There are a lot of cameras!

69
00:04:37,160 --> 00:04:38,400
Here comes another one.

70
00:04:40,660 --> 00:04:41,670
That's a lot of bags!

71
00:04:42,230 --> 00:04:44,770
He's pretty hyped up!

72
00:04:47,570 --> 00:04:48,140
Hello.

73
00:04:48,870 --> 00:04:49,940
It's been a while.

74
00:04:49,940 --> 00:04:51,210
It really has.

75
00:04:51,310 --> 00:04:52,310
Excuse me.

76
00:04:53,210 --> 00:04:53,940
It's really been a minute.

77
00:04:54,180 --> 00:04:55,110
This guy looks strong.

78
00:04:55,580 --> 00:04:57,920
-That's amazing!
-He's gotta be good!

79
00:04:59,620 --> 00:05:01,720
I'm Show Ayanocozey from Kishidan. (EN: 4)

80
00:05:02,590 --> 00:05:04,350
My occupation is: Pro Yankee.

81
00:05:05,320 --> 00:05:06,760
I'm a bit nervous.

82
00:05:12,130 --> 00:05:13,000
Excuse me.

83
00:05:14,000 --> 00:05:18,040
I'm in my day to day clothes but I am Show Ayanocozey from Kishidan.

84
00:05:19,570 --> 00:05:20,940
You really just appeared out of nowhere.

85
00:05:22,310 --> 00:05:24,840
We're in the middle of the street, you know?

86
00:05:26,780 --> 00:05:30,750
I always enjoy watching Documental.

87
00:05:30,950 --> 00:05:34,020
I even watched Ikemental and Joshimental.

88
00:05:34,690 --> 00:05:38,120
I would put my money on him.

89
00:05:38,460 --> 00:05:43,090
He's that kind of musician with just the right amount of tension and relaxation in his spirit.

90
00:05:43,530 --> 00:05:45,800
That's why I think he'll do well.

91
00:05:47,700 --> 00:05:50,000
Preparation has been a big part of my life.

92
00:05:50,300 --> 00:05:53,900
We always have to be prepared for festivals or really, any other event.

93
00:05:54,240 --> 00:05:58,880
I'm always on the edge.
Will I succeed today, or will I pull the short straw?

94
00:06:01,780 --> 00:06:09,890
It's a bit like my days in an indie band, before I even made my debut.
Because it's like a battle royale.

95
00:06:10,090 --> 00:06:16,560
This might be the beginning of a new phase in life for me.

96
00:06:19,860 --> 00:06:21,770
-I had no clue who would be here today.

97
00:06:21,770 --> 00:06:23,770
-I couldn't imagine it either.
-I had no clue who would be here today.

98
00:06:23,770 --> 00:06:24,330
-I had no clue who would be here today.

99
00:06:27,300 --> 00:06:28,470
It's a weird sense of nervousness.

100
00:06:28,470 --> 00:06:29,040
There're also tons of cameras around.
It's a weird sense of nervousness.

101
00:06:29,040 --> 00:06:30,470
There're also tons of cameras around.

102
00:06:30,470 --> 00:06:31,010
For real.
There're also tons of cameras around.

103
00:06:31,010 --> 00:06:31,380
For real.

104
00:06:32,710 --> 00:06:34,180
I never thought I'd actually be here.

105
00:06:34,180 --> 00:06:34,880
Me neither.

106
00:06:38,050 --> 00:06:38,850
He's also got quite the bag...

107
00:06:38,850 --> 00:06:38,920
He's loaded.
He's also got quite the bag...

108
00:06:38,920 --> 00:06:40,650
He's loaded.

109
00:06:42,890 --> 00:06:43,390
Hello.

110
00:06:44,960 --> 00:06:45,720
-It's Hiro.
-Awesome!

111
00:06:47,590 --> 00:06:48,560
-That's Hiro.
-Hiro!

112
00:06:48,560 --> 00:06:48,930
-Hello!
-Hello.
-That's Hiro.
-Hiro!

113
00:06:48,930 --> 00:06:49,530
-Hello!
-Hello.

114
00:06:49,530 --> 00:06:50,230
Nice to meet you.
-Hello!
-Hello.

115
00:06:50,230 --> 00:06:50,330
-Hello!
-Hello.

116
00:06:50,990 --> 00:06:52,200
Please take care of me.

117
00:06:52,260 --> 00:06:54,060
Nice to meet you.

118
00:06:56,400 --> 00:06:59,470
I'm Hiro, the vocalist of My First Story. (EN: 5)

119
00:06:59,640 --> 00:07:03,070
I'm more nervous than when I played at the Budokan.
(EN: 6)

120
00:07:08,110 --> 00:07:08,850
Good job today.

121
00:07:08,950 --> 00:07:10,110
Good job.

122
00:07:11,350 --> 00:07:12,150
Here you go.

123
00:07:12,720 --> 00:07:15,720
So we're not getting any comedians this time around?

124
00:07:15,890 --> 00:07:16,950
He's our youngest member.

125
00:07:21,430 --> 00:07:26,330
I think he'll be very slippery and maybe even make it to the end.

126
00:07:27,600 --> 00:07:29,930
But I'd bet his offensive power is not great.

127
00:07:35,410 --> 00:07:41,410
I was born into this kind of family, so I might have to make use of that.

128
00:07:42,950 --> 00:07:45,750
I'm gonna give it my best shot.

129
00:07:46,880 --> 00:07:48,650
This is crazy!

130
00:07:48,790 --> 00:07:50,350
Oh my...

131
00:07:51,760 --> 00:07:53,360
I didn't think you'd show up here.

132
00:07:53,360 --> 00:07:53,620
Me neither!
I didn't think you'd show up here.

133
00:07:53,620 --> 00:07:54,290
Me neither!

134
00:07:54,890 --> 00:07:57,430
I can only act cool on stage.

135
00:07:57,990 --> 00:08:01,030
So I'm gonna go all out today.

136
00:08:02,370 --> 00:08:04,600
In any case, I will give it my best shot.

137
00:08:07,970 --> 00:08:09,940
I thought there would at least be some comedians here.

138
00:08:10,170 --> 00:08:11,040
Oh right.

139
00:08:11,380 --> 00:08:12,240
I see, I see.

140
00:08:13,040 --> 00:08:13,680
But none for now...

141
00:08:13,810 --> 00:08:16,180
-Right.
-It's all musicians...

142
00:08:16,250 --> 00:08:18,950
Yeah, all of us are musicians!

143
00:08:29,090 --> 00:08:29,560
Who is it?

144
00:08:34,260 --> 00:08:35,500
This is the best!

145
00:08:37,270 --> 00:08:38,670
-This is awesome!
-He'll be way too strong!

146
00:08:38,840 --> 00:08:39,700
Nice to meet you.

147
00:08:39,700 --> 00:08:40,200
Nice to meet you.
Nice to meet you.

148
00:08:40,200 --> 00:08:40,700
Nice to meet you.

149
00:08:40,740 --> 00:08:42,470
-That's a great hairstyle.
-Thank you!

150
00:08:43,410 --> 00:08:45,140
I'm Naomasa Musaka. (EN: 7)

151
00:08:45,180 --> 00:08:47,280
I am an actor by trade.

152
00:08:47,280 --> 00:08:49,880
I will get that 10 million Yen.

153
00:08:51,250 --> 00:08:52,350
This is the invitation.

154
00:08:52,550 --> 00:08:54,950
Oh, from the Master himself, Hitoshi Matsumoto.

155
00:08:55,020 --> 00:08:56,350
Oh my, oh my.

156
00:08:58,490 --> 00:09:04,360
I've written some sketches for Mr. Matsumoto, and he's even directed some of my stuff.

157
00:09:04,760 --> 00:09:07,830
He's been very good to me.

158
00:09:07,900 --> 00:09:11,130
I just thought we needed someone like him.
That's why we invited him.

159
00:09:12,800 --> 00:09:14,200
He's our oldest member.

160
00:09:20,480 --> 00:09:22,150
Have you seen Documental?

161
00:09:22,150 --> 00:09:22,150
I haven't.
Have you seen Documental?

162
00:09:22,150 --> 00:09:22,710
I haven't.

163
00:09:23,180 --> 00:09:26,050
But for 10 million Yen, I'd do anything.

164
00:09:26,180 --> 00:09:28,490
It takes guts to appear on this show, you know?

165
00:09:30,390 --> 00:09:31,250
I guess it's our first time meeting, right?

166
00:09:31,250 --> 00:09:32,960
-Yes.
-Please take good care of me.

167
00:09:33,460 --> 00:09:36,730
I'm a bit worried about his stamina.

168
00:09:38,130 --> 00:09:40,930
Well, I've done plenty of 4+ hour plays.

169
00:09:43,300 --> 00:09:48,610
To me a 4 hour play is not that long.

170
00:09:49,170 --> 00:09:54,310
Honestly speaking, it'd be so boring if he won.

171
00:09:59,680 --> 00:10:03,490
So we can still laugh, right?
Director Matsumoto, hasn't been in here yet has he?

172
00:10:03,490 --> 00:10:04,550
-Yes, it's totally fine.
-It's still okay.

173
00:10:04,690 --> 00:10:05,690
At least for now.

174
00:10:07,490 --> 00:10:08,790
He won't come anytime soon.

175
00:10:09,260 --> 00:10:10,660
But in variety shows they sometimes do it...

176
00:10:11,060 --> 00:10:12,060
They sometimes come out.

177
00:10:12,500 --> 00:10:13,700
It's pretty rare...

178
00:10:16,430 --> 00:10:17,170
Hello.

179
00:10:19,070 --> 00:10:20,670
Oh, if it isn't the Yokozuna.
(EN: 8)

180
00:10:20,670 --> 00:10:21,370
Nice to meet you.
Oh, if it isn't the Yokozuna.
(EN: 8)

181
00:10:21,370 --> 00:10:22,740
Nice to meet you.

182
00:10:23,540 --> 00:10:24,770
Will he laugh?

183
00:10:25,080 --> 00:10:26,710
-He won't!
-There's no way!

184
00:10:28,480 --> 00:10:33,220
I am the 65th Yokozuna, Koji Takanohana.

185
00:10:34,350 --> 00:10:38,660
I am here today because I received an invitation.

186
00:10:40,990 --> 00:10:42,190
-This is the invitation.
-Thank you.

187
00:10:42,830 --> 00:10:43,760
Documental...

188
00:10:44,630 --> 00:10:48,230
It seems to be a deeply meaningful project.

189
00:10:48,770 --> 00:10:51,400
When they told me he'd be participating I was like, "Are you serious?!".

190
00:10:52,640 --> 00:10:54,040
Why?!

191
00:10:54,940 --> 00:10:58,340
He must think it's some kind of normal documentary.

192
00:10:59,540 --> 00:11:00,680
But this is something else!

193
00:11:00,880 --> 00:11:02,680
It's a Documental.

194
00:11:03,080 --> 00:11:08,180
As a kid I was often instructed not to show my emotions.

195
00:11:08,490 --> 00:11:12,060
I was taught to act like this from a very young age.

196
00:11:12,160 --> 00:11:14,990
So, I think I still have a bit of that old habit left in me.

197
00:11:18,030 --> 00:11:19,960
He comes from a world where not even a fist pump is allowed.

198
00:11:20,730 --> 00:11:26,600
So I'm very curious as to what Mr. Takanohana will show us.

199
00:11:28,810 --> 00:11:29,840
I see...

200
00:11:30,270 --> 00:11:31,510
I don't want to lose.

201
00:11:32,680 --> 00:11:34,980
I will endure and take home the win.

202
00:11:39,120 --> 00:11:41,350
-He's a superstar!
-Totally!

203
00:11:41,350 --> 00:11:41,850
No, not at all.

204
00:11:42,650 --> 00:11:46,020
I still remember how he won through those injuries.

205
00:11:46,590 --> 00:11:48,120
I could never forget the face you made.

206
00:11:48,120 --> 00:11:48,490
Really?
I could never forget the face you made.

207
00:11:48,490 --> 00:11:49,260
Really?

208
00:11:49,430 --> 00:11:52,030
And that move as he uncovered his face...

209
00:11:52,060 --> 00:11:52,760
Right.

210
00:11:52,930 --> 00:11:54,100
It was such a great match.

211
00:11:58,300 --> 00:11:59,900
Oh, again!

212
00:12:00,340 --> 00:12:01,100
Nice to meet you!

213
00:12:01,100 --> 00:12:01,610
It's his second time, isn't it?
Nice to meet you!

214
00:12:01,610 --> 00:12:01,940
It's his second time, isn't it?

215
00:12:01,970 --> 00:12:02,870
-That's right.
-Right.

216
00:12:02,940 --> 00:12:05,040
-He was in Ikemental.
-Right, Ikemental.

217
00:12:05,140 --> 00:12:07,910
He seems to have enjoyed it quite a lot.

218
00:12:07,980 --> 00:12:09,380
I never thought Katsunori would show up here.

219
00:12:09,380 --> 00:12:09,780
Oh my...

220
00:12:09,780 --> 00:12:10,080
No way, no way...
Oh my...

221
00:12:10,080 --> 00:12:11,550
No way, no way...

222
00:12:14,350 --> 00:12:15,690
I'm Katsunori Takahashi. (EN: 10)

223
00:12:16,250 --> 00:12:18,290
I'm an actor and singer.

224
00:12:18,320 --> 00:12:21,990
I'm more nervous about this job than any other project I'm currently involved in.

225
00:12:23,660 --> 00:12:24,290
Could it be?

226
00:12:24,730 --> 00:12:26,560
I'm starting to get flashbacks.

227
00:12:27,560 --> 00:12:28,230
It was very intense.

228
00:12:28,400 --> 00:12:30,600
This guy is good.

229
00:12:30,630 --> 00:12:33,200
I really wanted to bring him in again.

230
00:12:33,540 --> 00:12:36,640
He really made his home at Ikemental.

231
00:12:36,770 --> 00:12:39,210
It was super funny.

232
00:12:41,210 --> 00:12:43,850
I only realized how fun it had been after the fact.

233
00:12:44,550 --> 00:12:48,550
He actually handed me a very heart-warming hand-written letter after the last show.

234
00:12:48,790 --> 00:12:54,160
He wrote of how fun it was to participate in Ikemental.

235
00:12:55,130 --> 00:12:58,030
I do think this is a new kind of challenge.

236
00:12:58,960 --> 00:13:01,460
I really wondered, why did he enjoy it that much?

237
00:13:05,670 --> 00:13:07,240
This is amazing!

238
00:13:09,340 --> 00:13:10,540
I don't wanna sit next to Yusuke.

239
00:13:10,570 --> 00:13:12,410
Why?
Hold on, stay here!

240
00:13:12,540 --> 00:13:13,310
Why?!

241
00:13:15,580 --> 00:13:18,780
Director Shinjo, who was actually with the same agency as me, (EN: 11)

242
00:13:18,880 --> 00:13:20,920
told me he was the only one suited for this job.

243
00:13:21,920 --> 00:13:27,390
And that's when I got this invitation from Mr. Matsumoto.

244
00:13:28,060 --> 00:13:32,800
So I thought it would be a good opportunity to improve my skill as an actor.

245
00:13:36,000 --> 00:13:36,870
There's another empty seat here.

246
00:13:38,270 --> 00:13:39,340
Oh, I'll go there.

247
00:13:39,370 --> 00:13:40,270
Hold on!

248
00:13:40,500 --> 00:13:41,500
It doesn't matter where you sit!

249
00:13:41,710 --> 00:13:42,640
There's no deep meaning behind this.

250
00:13:43,870 --> 00:13:45,340
But Mr. Musaka...

251
00:13:45,940 --> 00:13:46,880
What are you doing here?

252
00:13:46,880 --> 00:13:47,580
What do you mean?

253
00:13:47,780 --> 00:13:48,210
I'm so shocked to see you here.

254
00:13:48,210 --> 00:13:48,680
Well, I'm currently doing some plays...
I'm so shocked to see you here.

255
00:13:48,680 --> 00:13:50,380
Well, I'm currently doing some plays...

256
00:13:50,580 --> 00:13:52,320
But I had to come since it was Director Matsumoto who called.

257
00:13:52,520 --> 00:13:53,150
Oh, really?

258
00:13:53,780 --> 00:13:54,620
Aren't you quite busy these days?

259
00:13:59,420 --> 00:13:59,890
Really?

260
00:13:59,990 --> 00:14:00,960
I'm also doing some plays at the moment.

261
00:14:03,590 --> 00:14:05,500
Oh, it's been a while!

262
00:14:05,900 --> 00:14:07,400
Hold on, this is crazy.

263
00:14:08,600 --> 00:14:09,300
Hold on!

264
00:14:10,170 --> 00:14:12,970
I think he'll be really good.

265
00:14:13,140 --> 00:14:13,600
He's gonna be strong.

266
00:14:13,600 --> 00:14:14,140
He'll be going all on the offensive.
He's gonna be strong.

267
00:14:14,140 --> 00:14:15,710
He'll be going all on the offensive.

268
00:14:19,840 --> 00:14:21,210
I'm Shingo Katori. (EN: 12)

269
00:14:21,510 --> 00:14:22,750
I just want to get this started.

270
00:14:25,650 --> 00:14:26,450
What?

271
00:14:27,380 --> 00:14:28,920
I would never refuse.

272
00:14:29,250 --> 00:14:31,390
Shingo Katori will be on Documental.

273
00:14:33,520 --> 00:14:35,730
We really got everyone this time around.

274
00:14:38,130 --> 00:14:39,600
He's a big name.

275
00:14:40,800 --> 00:14:44,530
I mean, he is an idol and he's also had some experience with comedy.

276
00:14:44,970 --> 00:14:47,500
I think he really understands the premise.

277
00:14:48,470 --> 00:14:50,270
Ma-chan invited me, right?

278
00:14:52,140 --> 00:14:54,380
You know, I'm here today as a sort of audition.

279
00:14:56,350 --> 00:14:58,180
To make Matsumoto like me.

280
00:14:59,380 --> 00:15:03,820
I'm betting my whole career on this show.

281
00:15:05,320 --> 00:15:07,890
I hope he goes, "That kid is good".

282
00:15:08,590 --> 00:15:10,360
I'm gonna give everything I got.

283
00:15:13,530 --> 00:15:14,400
Can I sit here?

284
00:15:16,830 --> 00:15:18,300
What is going on?

285
00:15:20,270 --> 00:15:22,140
I don't know!
I hate this!

286
00:15:22,340 --> 00:15:23,670
How do we have this many big names?

287
00:15:23,710 --> 00:15:26,280
What an amazing group.

288
00:15:28,480 --> 00:15:30,110
This one's gonna be hard to predict.

289
00:15:30,180 --> 00:15:32,650
-It's a really wild one.
-For real.

290
00:15:43,090 --> 00:15:43,790
An actor?

291
00:15:44,060 --> 00:15:46,800
I went to watch it yesterday.

292
00:15:46,860 --> 00:15:49,170
-I was surprised.
-Once you watch it...

293
00:15:49,700 --> 00:15:51,370
That's right...

294
00:15:51,700 --> 00:15:53,500
-Oh, that startled me.
-Good morning!

295
00:15:53,570 --> 00:15:54,700
-Good morning!
-Good morning!

296
00:15:54,840 --> 00:15:55,740
Director!

297
00:15:56,840 --> 00:15:58,370
What a stacked group!

298
00:15:58,470 --> 00:16:00,410
Please take a seat!

299
00:16:00,780 --> 00:16:03,810
I'm really starting to get worried now.

300
00:16:04,950 --> 00:16:06,920
A shared house with all these members would be the worst!

301
00:16:08,450 --> 00:16:09,820
Everyon, please take a seat.

302
00:16:09,920 --> 00:16:10,790
Excuse us.

303
00:16:11,520 --> 00:16:13,490
Oyakata, that is actually my seat...(EN: 13)

304
00:16:13,490 --> 00:16:13,690
Oh, really?
Oyakata, that is actually my seat...(EN: 13)

305
00:16:13,690 --> 00:16:14,390
Oh, really?

306
00:16:15,460 --> 00:16:17,130
It's fine, we'll just move.

307
00:16:17,230 --> 00:16:18,390
Let's move around.

308
00:16:19,130 --> 00:16:20,660
Please take a seat.

309
00:16:21,870 --> 00:16:24,070
Sorry about that.

310
00:16:25,000 --> 00:16:31,910
First and foremost, I am truly grateful that each and every one of you came today.

311
00:16:31,910 --> 00:16:32,380
-Thank you!
-Thank you.

312
00:16:32,440 --> 00:16:35,510
But I'm really worried about today.

313
00:16:35,550 --> 00:16:38,650
I'm incredibly nervous.

314
00:16:39,220 --> 00:16:41,720
We also have such a big gap in ages.

315
00:16:42,120 --> 00:16:43,650
And everyone comes from a different industry.

316
00:16:44,020 --> 00:16:46,460
So anyway, I don't know what's gonna happen today.

317
00:16:46,620 --> 00:16:49,290
By the way, the prize is 10 million Yen.

318
00:16:50,990 --> 00:16:52,960
-And Katsunori is the only one with experience, right?
-Yes.

319
00:16:53,000 --> 00:16:53,630
That's right.

320
00:16:54,400 --> 00:16:54,800
Right.

321
00:16:54,800 --> 00:16:56,430
-He was on Ikemental.
-Oh, right! Ikemental...

322
00:16:56,430 --> 00:16:56,770
I was here once before.
-He was on Ikemental.
-Oh, right! Ikemental...

323
00:16:56,770 --> 00:16:57,330
I was here once before.

324
00:16:57,330 --> 00:16:57,870
It was incredibly funny.
I was here once before.

325
00:16:57,870 --> 00:16:59,640
It was incredibly funny.

326
00:16:59,670 --> 00:17:03,470
But unfortunately he laughed early on and dropped out prematurely.

327
00:17:03,540 --> 00:17:05,380
So I hope you go far this time around.

328
00:17:05,480 --> 00:17:07,280
-Please aim for a win today.
-I will try my best.

329
00:17:07,440 --> 00:17:08,880
I'm a bit worried about Hiro.

330
00:17:09,110 --> 00:17:10,210
-Me too...
-He's our youngest member!

331
00:17:10,380 --> 00:17:13,650
That's right, I'm the youngest one here and it's also my first time meeting everyone.

332
00:17:14,750 --> 00:17:18,450
It feels like I've been thrown in the middle of a hurricane.

333
00:17:18,450 --> 00:17:21,120
Your father, Shinichi Mori, won't help you here, you know? (EN: 14)

334
00:17:22,530 --> 00:17:23,890
Right, but I will give it my best.

335
00:17:23,990 --> 00:17:24,930
Right, please do.

336
00:17:24,930 --> 00:17:25,330
I will.
Right, please do.

337
00:17:25,330 --> 00:17:26,530
I will.

338
00:17:26,760 --> 00:17:29,470
The only one I can't seem to read is Oyakata.

339
00:17:29,500 --> 00:17:30,600
-Totally.
-Me neither.

340
00:17:31,430 --> 00:17:32,900
I think he's gonna be good.

341
00:17:33,170 --> 00:17:35,170
Everyone will laugh when they see those weird eyes of his.

342
00:17:35,310 --> 00:17:37,310
I think so too.

343
00:17:37,470 --> 00:17:38,070
Katori...

344
00:17:39,310 --> 00:17:41,040
How are you feeling?

345
00:17:41,040 --> 00:17:42,550
Katori seems to be quite fired up.

346
00:17:42,550 --> 00:17:43,310
What are you gonna do?
Katori seems to be quite fired up.

347
00:17:43,310 --> 00:17:44,950
What are you gonna do?

348
00:17:45,110 --> 00:17:47,450
I mean, I always have a smile when I talk.

349
00:17:47,620 --> 00:17:48,420
Oh, right...

350
00:17:49,250 --> 00:17:50,150
"Oh, really?!".

351
00:17:50,220 --> 00:17:51,420
Oh, you'd be out with that.

352
00:17:52,090 --> 00:17:52,720
That's not good.

353
00:17:53,490 --> 00:17:57,230
I can give you an instant red card if it's really bad.

354
00:17:58,830 --> 00:18:00,960
But we have the yellow card and the red card.

355
00:18:01,060 --> 00:18:07,870
And we'll give you an orange one when it's a bit of a grey area.

356
00:18:08,770 --> 00:18:10,870
But I've also brought this with me.

357
00:18:10,870 --> 00:18:12,910
-This is the prize money.
-Awesome!

358
00:18:15,810 --> 00:18:16,810
Awesome!

359
00:18:17,010 --> 00:18:22,250
Before, each person would have to bring his or her own million Yen.
But we've done away with that rule.

360
00:18:22,450 --> 00:18:25,590
Besides, there's no way I'd be able to ask a million Yen from you guys.

361
00:18:25,760 --> 00:18:27,520
So whoever wins can just take this home.

362
00:18:27,660 --> 00:18:28,660
That's awesome.

363
00:18:28,860 --> 00:18:29,860
One of you guys will win.

364
00:18:33,230 --> 00:18:35,470
Alright then, I will go back to judging.

365
00:18:35,470 --> 00:18:36,570
-Please take care of us.
-Please do.

366
00:18:36,570 --> 00:18:37,800
So, I will be taking my leave now.
-Please take care of us.
-Please do.

367
00:18:37,800 --> 00:18:38,740
So, I will be taking my leave now.

368
00:18:38,870 --> 00:18:40,640
The game will start once the buzzer goes off.

369
00:18:40,640 --> 00:18:40,870
I'm so nervous!
The game will start once the buzzer goes off.

370
00:18:40,870 --> 00:18:42,070
I'm so nervous!

371
00:18:42,370 --> 00:18:43,370
Alright then, excuse me!

372
00:18:43,440 --> 00:18:44,140
Thank you!

373
00:18:44,210 --> 00:18:45,880
Take good care of us!

374
00:18:47,980 --> 00:18:50,680
Oh god...

375
00:18:50,710 --> 00:18:52,250
I'm starting to get nervous.

376
00:18:55,320 --> 00:18:55,920
Oh no!

377
00:18:56,320 --> 00:18:57,250
I'm so nervous!

378
00:18:57,650 --> 00:18:59,620
This is not the cast I had pictured!

379
00:19:00,190 --> 00:19:00,920
Everyone...

380
00:19:02,090 --> 00:19:06,660
-Alright, these smiles will vanish once I press this button.
-Yes!

381
00:19:06,960 --> 00:19:08,360
Let's go for another Documental...

382
00:19:08,360 --> 00:19:09,500
It's very exciting.
Let's go for another Documental...

383
00:19:09,500 --> 00:19:10,430
It's very exciting.

384
00:19:10,830 --> 00:19:12,170
...Start!

385
00:19:13,570 --> 00:19:14,000
Here we go!

386
00:19:15,140 --> 00:19:17,040
-Who's gonna attack first?
-Who is it?

387
00:19:17,270 --> 00:19:18,880
The first attack is very important.

388
00:19:18,910 --> 00:19:19,680
Right.

389
00:19:20,310 --> 00:19:22,680
I was most nervous when walking through the door.

390
00:19:22,810 --> 00:19:23,910
Oyakata is laughing?

391
00:19:23,910 --> 00:19:25,250
I was super nervous, I could barely sleep yesterday.
Oyakata is laughing?

392
00:19:25,250 --> 00:19:27,250
I was super nervous, I could barely sleep yesterday.

393
00:19:27,520 --> 00:19:27,920
-Is Oyakata laughing?
-Is he?

394
00:19:27,920 --> 00:19:28,650
Did you get any sleep?
-Is Oyakata laughing?
-Is he?

395
00:19:28,650 --> 00:19:29,420
-Is Oyakata laughing?
-Is he?

396
00:19:29,520 --> 00:19:29,950
I did.

397
00:19:30,350 --> 00:19:30,620
Me too.

398
00:19:31,150 --> 00:19:31,550
That's amazing.

399
00:19:32,890 --> 00:19:33,560
I couldn't sleep...

400
00:19:34,860 --> 00:19:37,560
Actually I was the first to come in.

401
00:19:38,260 --> 00:19:39,260
Did you guys hear any voices before coming in?

402
00:19:40,460 --> 00:19:41,300
Takashi is setting something up.

403
00:19:41,300 --> 00:19:42,130
Everyone was laughing when I came in.
Takashi is setting something up.

404
00:19:42,130 --> 00:19:43,070
Everyone was laughing when I came in.

405
00:19:44,200 --> 00:19:45,540
You three were laughing.

406
00:19:45,900 --> 00:19:46,500
Right...

407
00:19:46,740 --> 00:19:48,370
But I didn't hear anything else.

408
00:19:48,400 --> 00:19:49,440
Me neither...

409
00:19:49,540 --> 00:19:51,010
Oh, really?

410
00:19:52,440 --> 00:19:54,840
-That part looks a bit like my home.
-Oh, really?

411
00:19:55,750 --> 00:19:56,610
I was desperate.

412
00:20:01,620 --> 00:20:02,820
Oyakata was definitely laughing right now!

413
00:20:02,820 --> 00:20:03,050
Wasn't that too fast?
Oyakata was definitely laughing right now!

414
00:20:03,050 --> 00:20:03,520
Wasn't that too fast?

415
00:20:04,050 --> 00:20:05,290
Did Oyakata slip?

416
00:20:06,090 --> 00:20:06,490
No way!

417
00:20:06,490 --> 00:20:07,020
Guys! You have to keep a lookout!
No way!

418
00:20:07,020 --> 00:20:09,560
Guys! You have to keep a lookout!

419
00:20:09,560 --> 00:20:09,760
But I was watching!
Guys! You have to keep a lookout!

420
00:20:09,760 --> 00:20:10,960
But I was watching!

421
00:20:11,660 --> 00:20:12,500
No way!

422
00:20:13,100 --> 00:20:15,030
That has to be the fastest laugh in Documental history.

423
00:20:15,060 --> 00:20:15,700
The fastest!

424
00:20:15,900 --> 00:20:16,600
Eh?!

425
00:20:18,000 --> 00:20:19,270
Did someone laugh?!

426
00:20:19,300 --> 00:20:20,170
Who was it?

427
00:20:20,540 --> 00:20:22,810
This might be the fastest one yet.

428
00:20:23,170 --> 00:20:25,510
It was Takanohana Oyakata.

429
00:20:26,680 --> 00:20:27,210
That's surprising.

430
00:20:27,210 --> 00:20:27,610
So, were you aware of your actions?
That's surprising.

431
00:20:27,610 --> 00:20:29,310
So, were you aware of your actions?

432
00:20:30,010 --> 00:20:33,080
Well yes, I turned sociable for a minute there.

433
00:20:33,620 --> 00:20:34,850
Hold on, hold on!

434
00:20:34,850 --> 00:20:35,150
Let's check it out first!
Hold on, hold on!

435
00:20:35,150 --> 00:20:36,920
Let's check it out first!

436
00:20:37,890 --> 00:20:41,220
It might have been my mistake so...

437
00:20:42,090 --> 00:20:45,330
-That part looks a bit like my
home.
-Oh, really?

438
00:20:45,390 --> 00:20:46,300
I was desperate.

439
00:20:50,170 --> 00:20:51,100
You can't be doing that!

440
00:20:51,100 --> 00:20:51,630
That was bad!
You can't be doing that!

441
00:20:51,630 --> 00:20:52,570
That was bad!

442
00:20:53,870 --> 00:20:55,810
So fast! That was super fast!

443
00:20:55,810 --> 00:20:56,110
You're out.
So fast! That was super fast!

444
00:20:56,110 --> 00:20:57,370
You're out.

445
00:20:58,110 --> 00:20:59,380
You were really smiling.

446
00:21:00,340 --> 00:21:02,810
I mean, this is just a yellow card.

447
00:21:03,310 --> 00:21:04,950
We'll get you even for something as small as that.

448
00:21:05,150 --> 00:21:06,020
Right.

449
00:21:06,320 --> 00:21:07,820
He was just venting.

450
00:21:07,850 --> 00:21:09,350
Right, right.

451
00:21:09,450 --> 00:21:11,350
Oyakata, you took the initiative and sacrificed yourself first.

452
00:21:11,790 --> 00:21:13,490
Thank you.

453
00:21:13,720 --> 00:21:15,460
Thank you, we learned a lot with that.
