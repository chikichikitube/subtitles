1
00:00:01,130 --> 00:00:05,930
Tonight Gaki is going to a town they have never been to and asking them the best 5 places: Part 2!

2
00:00:06,870 --> 00:00:15,380
They will draw one of the lots with the names of all the stations in the Kanto region and find out the best 5 places recommended by locals in towns they have never been to.

3
00:00:16,440 --> 00:00:18,080
What is the station that Housei drew?

4
00:00:19,910 --> 00:00:20,850
Where's that?

5
00:00:20,850 --> 00:00:21,850
Iwai.

6
00:00:21,850 --> 00:00:23,350
- Iwai?
- Iwai??

7
00:00:24,090 --> 00:00:28,420
It's JR Iwai Station in Minami-Boso City, Chiba Prefecture.

8
00:00:28,590 --> 00:00:32,130
What are the top 5 recommended by its locals?

9
00:00:33,330 --> 00:00:39,500
First of all, what is the 5th place recommended by Kawana-san, who has lived in Iwai for 30 years, whom we met in front of the station?

10
00:00:40,740 --> 00:00:42,000
It's the beach.

11
00:00:44,140 --> 00:00:48,580
That's Iwai Beach, which is popular among locals and sightseers alike.

12
00:00:49,080 --> 00:00:52,580
- Oh, but there are some people.
- There are some people!

13
00:00:54,150 --> 00:00:56,920
The view is very nice.

14
00:00:57,220 --> 00:00:58,520
That's good.

15
00:00:59,890 --> 00:01:05,560
Then they interviewed people who were at Iwai Beach for the 4th place.

16
00:01:06,030 --> 00:01:12,430
Matsuura-san, who has been visiting this beach for 30 years, told them about it.

17
00:01:12,930 --> 00:01:16,670
For example, there is a observatory on Mt. Tomi.

18
00:01:16,670 --> 00:01:18,310
Observatory on Mt. Tomi?

19
00:01:18,310 --> 00:01:21,980
If we go there on foot, won't we die?

20
00:01:24,710 --> 00:01:32,150
They headed to the observatory of Mt. Tomi, which is said to have beautiful views, and they climbed the mountain in temperatures over 30°C (86°F).

21
00:01:35,420 --> 00:01:37,590
This is intense hiking!!

22
00:01:38,090 --> 00:01:40,900
That's really true.

23
00:01:40,900 --> 00:01:44,130
This is intense hiking in the middle of summer.
And I'm wearing Crocs!!

24
00:01:46,030 --> 00:01:47,600
I'm so tired.

25
00:01:49,640 --> 00:01:52,610
Then 35 minutes had passed since they started their climb.

26
00:01:52,940 --> 00:01:54,680
It takes 45 minutes from here to the observatory.

27
00:01:58,580 --> 00:01:59,650
Okay, we'll split up here.

28
00:02:01,420 --> 00:02:03,150
If we all climb up, we will run out of time.

29
00:02:03,450 --> 00:02:05,390
One of us should climb it.

30
00:02:06,390 --> 00:02:10,730
They decided to play rock-paper-scissors and only the loser would climb the mountain.
- First comes rock, rock-paper-scissors!

31
00:02:15,700 --> 00:02:16,760
That's good!

32
00:02:17,330 --> 00:02:22,300
Who would climb among Matsumoto, Housei and Endo?
- First comes rock, rock-paper-scissors!

33
00:02:27,280 --> 00:02:30,750
- Okay, I'll go.
- Shozo Endo will go climb!

34
00:02:30,750 --> 00:02:32,180
Well, I'll be going.

35
00:02:33,550 --> 00:02:36,890
Endo has to go alone to the observatory of Mt. Tomi.

36
00:02:37,850 --> 00:02:42,320
Top 5 recommended places around Iwai station.
What on earth will happen?

37
00:02:42,520 --> 00:02:49,660
[Subbed by RAIDEN1017]

38
00:02:51,370 --> 00:02:57,740
Endo set off alone for the observatory at Mt. Tomi, the 4th recommended place to visit.

39
00:02:58,910 --> 00:03:00,680
Oh, this is insane.

40
00:03:00,680 --> 00:03:03,140
This is really insane.

41
00:03:03,140 --> 00:03:05,580
Ugh, this is too bad.

42
00:03:08,620 --> 00:03:10,390
I'm really afraid of this.

43
00:03:11,620 --> 00:03:12,720
Please be careful.

44
00:03:13,990 --> 00:03:16,790
- It's pretty dangerous here.
- Really so.

45
00:03:22,600 --> 00:03:24,600
Did I lose because I sang Miss Brand-New Day?

46
00:03:28,040 --> 00:03:33,410
Endo climbs up the mountain trail
in temperatures over 30 ℃.

47
00:03:37,850 --> 00:03:40,480
Wow!!
This is insane!

48
00:03:42,650 --> 00:03:43,750
Wait a minute.

49
00:03:44,620 --> 00:03:46,490
- This is insane.
- Yes.

50
00:03:53,090 --> 00:03:58,900
Except for Endo, the four of them came to Iwai Station again to ask the locals for the 3rd recommended place.

51
00:03:59,130 --> 00:04:03,370
First, Housei and Tanaka went to the tourist information center at the station to ask around.

52
00:04:05,670 --> 00:04:08,110
Oh, did you get any good information?

53
00:04:11,810 --> 00:04:19,120
- First, they introduced us to that mountain associated with Satomi Hakkenden.
- Yeah, we went the mountain earlier.

54
00:04:19,320 --> 00:04:21,620
- And the sea.
- Yeah, we went there too.

55
00:04:22,060 --> 00:04:24,990
Oh, Hi!
You're  the owner of the gold.

56
00:04:24,990 --> 00:04:28,930
I forgot to mention this, have you guys been to Furari?

57
00:04:29,300 --> 00:04:31,730
There is a road station named Furari

58
00:04:32,570 --> 00:04:38,640
They were talked by Kawana-san, the man with the shiny gold teeth, who told them about the 5th place, Iwai Beach.

59
00:04:39,710 --> 00:04:44,080
They asked Kawana-san for his 3rd recommended place.

60
00:04:45,050 --> 00:04:46,980
It's a roadside station.

61
00:04:48,450 --> 00:04:50,420
The roadside station?
I see.

62
00:04:50,650 --> 00:04:52,190
What did they introduce you guys to?

63
00:04:52,190 --> 00:04:54,360
- It's the  roadside station too.
- Really?

64
00:04:54,620 --> 00:04:56,390
So this is just fine.

65
00:04:56,390 --> 00:04:57,590
Would you like to go with us?

66
00:04:58,130 --> 00:04:59,560
Why do you want him to join?

67
00:04:59,560 --> 00:05:01,000
Let's not do that.

68
00:05:01,960 --> 00:05:03,870
Don't you think he's a replacement for Endo?

69
00:05:04,430 --> 00:05:06,330
Don't do that.

70
00:05:06,600 --> 00:05:09,070
Well, we'll go to the roadside station.

71
00:05:09,940 --> 00:05:13,240
If there's anything we don't understand, we'll come here.

72
00:05:13,240 --> 00:05:14,510
That's enough!

73
00:05:14,510 --> 00:05:16,880
Please come out when I clap my hands like this.

74
00:05:16,880 --> 00:05:18,750
He's not a pond fish.

75
00:05:20,450 --> 00:05:24,650
They immediately headed for the roadside station he had told them about.

76
00:05:26,490 --> 00:05:31,060
Meanwhile, Endo had been climbing the mountain alone for 20 minutes.

77
00:05:34,630 --> 00:05:36,000
It's too hot!

78
00:05:38,730 --> 00:05:40,100
Too hot...

79
00:05:44,010 --> 00:05:50,510
I had no idea that today's shoot would be this tough.

80
00:05:53,450 --> 00:05:58,050
After that, Endo continued to climb the steep mountain trail.

81
00:06:01,690 --> 00:06:05,690
It's really tough.
What are we going to do?

82
00:06:08,400 --> 00:06:10,700
This would be impossible for Downtown.

83
00:06:12,300 --> 00:06:14,170
And Matsumoto-san was wearing Crocs.

84
00:06:14,870 --> 00:06:19,040
He would never have expected this.

85
00:06:20,480 --> 00:06:22,340
I'll lose weight.

86
00:06:24,410 --> 00:06:26,680
Are you going already?

87
00:06:27,450 --> 00:06:29,880
- Are you ready to head to the observatory?
- Yeah!

88
00:06:31,550 --> 00:06:34,820
If I didn't go to the observatory I would be really pissed off at them.

89
00:06:38,090 --> 00:06:43,800
Meanwhile, the four of them were driving to the roadside station recommended as the 3rd recommendedd place.

90
00:06:44,430 --> 00:06:46,130
I'm starving.

91
00:06:47,370 --> 00:06:50,170
Did Endo eat anything in the waiting room?

92
00:06:51,040 --> 00:06:57,710
- No, he didn't eat anything.
- He must be starving.

93
00:06:57,980 --> 00:07:00,080
He didn't eat anything on the move either.

94
00:07:00,750 --> 00:07:02,080
The roadside station is there.

95
00:07:02,750 --> 00:07:04,320
It's big.

96
00:07:05,190 --> 00:07:07,820
Aren't all locals come here?

97
00:07:08,790 --> 00:07:10,890
Here we are!

98
00:07:12,290 --> 00:07:18,300
They arrived at the recommended roadside station, Furari, and immediately went inside.

99
00:07:21,370 --> 00:07:23,740
It's Biwa-chan, the Chiba-only mascot.

100
00:07:23,740 --> 00:07:25,810
Is she a biwa(loquat) ?

101
00:07:25,810 --> 00:07:27,640
Shouldn't this be 2nd place?

102
00:07:29,010 --> 00:07:30,710
If someone says so, that's fine.

103
00:07:30,710 --> 00:07:32,250
Excuse me.

104
00:07:33,180 --> 00:07:35,780
Is the roadside station only on the first floor?

105
00:07:36,180 --> 00:07:38,620
There is also the second floor.

106
00:07:38,620 --> 00:07:42,990
- What is on the second floor?
- There is a restaurant and a food court on the second floor.

107
00:07:43,720 --> 00:07:46,530
- Can I eat local food on the second floor?
- Of course.

108
00:07:47,430 --> 00:07:52,970
Guys, they have a restaurant here on the second floor where you can eat local food.

109
00:07:52,970 --> 00:07:54,600
Do you have any recommendations?

110
00:07:55,670 --> 00:07:58,770
- How about sangayaki?
- Sangayaki! Oh, good.

111
00:07:58,770 --> 00:08:00,810
- What's that?
- I don't know.

112
00:08:00,810 --> 00:08:02,940
Let's go there and check it out.

113
00:08:04,780 --> 00:08:08,780
They decided to eat the famous sangayaki on the second floor.

114
00:08:12,120 --> 00:08:14,160
Can I eat what I bought here?

115
00:08:14,160 --> 00:08:14,860
That's nice.

116
00:08:15,020 --> 00:08:17,960
It's a food court.

117
00:08:18,660 --> 00:08:21,600
They sell ramen and many other things.

118
00:08:22,460 --> 00:08:23,800
Hi.

119
00:08:24,170 --> 00:08:24,730
This looks delicious.

120
00:08:24,730 --> 00:08:26,430
It says "sangayaki" here.

121
00:08:26,430 --> 00:08:27,400
What's sangayaki?

122
00:08:29,570 --> 00:08:35,210
it's minced horse mackerel with green onion, miso and ginger.
Eating it raw is Namerou, and grilled one is called Sanga.

123
00:08:35,610 --> 00:08:37,350
Is this it?

124
00:08:37,450 --> 00:08:41,880
Whale and sanga are recommended.
You can try them if you like.

125
00:08:42,220 --> 00:08:43,350
Please give me four sangayaki.

126
00:08:43,780 --> 00:08:44,990
Thank you.

127
00:08:45,190 --> 00:08:46,820
I would like to try the meat-wrapped sausage.

128
00:08:46,820 --> 00:08:48,320
That's good.

129
00:08:51,130 --> 00:09:00,800
The four of them each chose what they wanted to eat and bought six items, including sangayaki and whale mince cutlets.

130
00:09:02,040 --> 00:09:03,600
Let's eat!

131
00:09:06,910 --> 00:09:07,740
This is delicious.

132
00:09:08,940 --> 00:09:10,210
This is great, huh.

133
00:09:11,450 --> 00:09:12,710
It's like tsumire(fish meatball).

134
00:09:13,510 --> 00:09:15,320
This one tastes like sardine tsumire.

135
00:09:15,680 --> 00:09:16,780
Yeah.

136
00:09:17,490 --> 00:09:18,520
This is good.

137
00:09:20,150 --> 00:09:23,930
At that time, Endo had been climbing the mountain alone for 30 minutes.

138
00:09:24,560 --> 00:09:26,290
There is a bell.

139
00:09:29,800 --> 00:09:31,670
Mt. Tomi Love Bell.

140
00:09:32,770 --> 00:09:40,240
"We set up the love bell on this Mt. Tomi so that the sound of love would echo through the climbers."

141
00:09:41,310 --> 00:09:45,810
I'll ring this bell for everyone at the bottom of the mountain.

142
00:09:54,390 --> 00:09:56,390
May love come to everyone.

143
00:09:59,890 --> 00:10:00,560
Let's go.

144
00:10:01,000 --> 00:10:02,600
- For everyone.
- Yeah.

145
00:10:05,730 --> 00:10:07,740
Do you think Endo is okay?

146
00:10:08,440 --> 00:10:10,070
That guy hasn't eaten anything, has he?

147
00:10:10,710 --> 00:10:12,510
Shouldn't we buy Endo something?

148
00:10:12,770 --> 00:10:13,640
Nah.

149
00:10:15,240 --> 00:10:17,240
Are we sure we don't need to buy him anything?

150
00:10:17,680 --> 00:10:18,980
He's not here.

151
00:10:19,850 --> 00:10:22,980
But he's going to the observatory instead of all of us.

152
00:10:23,780 --> 00:10:25,620
That's because he lost at rock-paper-scissors.

153
00:10:26,950 --> 00:10:28,060
You right.

154
00:10:30,520 --> 00:10:32,830
Roadside Station, Furari Tomiyama.

155
00:10:33,560 --> 00:10:39,330
The first floor sells flesh local fish and vegetables landed at the local fishing port.

156
00:10:40,800 --> 00:10:50,310
On the second floor, you can enjoy gourmet foods such as sangayaki made with horse mackerel from Minami-Boso.
This place is popular among tourists and locals alike.

157
00:10:51,010 --> 00:10:57,180
So, the 3rd recommended place around Iwai Station was recognized as the Roadside Station, Furari Tomiyama.

158
00:10:58,690 --> 00:11:02,890
Then 45 minutes passed since Endo started climbing the mountain alone.

159
00:11:04,630 --> 00:11:05,530
Isn't this the place!?

160
00:11:07,360 --> 00:11:08,300
Is it here?

161
00:11:13,500 --> 00:11:14,600
It's here!

162
00:11:15,000 --> 00:11:16,470
Wow!!

163
00:11:17,370 --> 00:11:19,710
Look, look, look!!

164
00:11:20,610 --> 00:11:24,080
It's a spectacular view!
It's really a spectacular view.

165
00:11:25,680 --> 00:11:29,580
It's fantastic!
You can see the whole Iwai from here.

166
00:11:30,120 --> 00:11:31,390
It's good enough to be the 1st place.

167
00:11:31,820 --> 00:11:33,450
I think it should be the 1st place.

168
00:11:34,360 --> 00:11:47,400
Mt. Tomi was the setting for the chuanqi novel Nanso Satomi Hakkenden, and is also a popular hiking course with views of Tokyo Bay and the Miura Peninsula.

169
00:11:49,440 --> 00:11:54,310
So Mt. Tomi was recognized as the 4th recommended place around Iwai Station.

170
00:11:55,310 --> 00:11:58,950
This spectacular view that I saw after all this hard work is the 1st place.

171
00:12:00,310 --> 00:12:01,550
But this is the 4th place, right?

172
00:12:03,250 --> 00:12:05,350
Why is this in the 4th place?

173
00:12:12,160 --> 00:12:17,030
They found the 5th to 3rd recommended places.

174
00:12:18,230 --> 00:12:23,200
Then they asked the clerks for the 2nd place.

175
00:12:23,640 --> 00:12:26,940
What is your 2nd recommended place around Iwai station?

176
00:12:28,010 --> 00:12:31,450
- I've only lived here a short time.
- Really?

177
00:12:32,910 --> 00:12:33,980
The mountain.

178
00:12:34,010 --> 00:12:34,750
The mountai?

179
00:12:35,180 --> 00:12:37,590
Mountain...? Hmmm..

180
00:12:37,820 --> 00:12:38,990
Is that wrong?

181
00:12:39,290 --> 00:12:42,660
Are there any shops?
Where is the place that sells your favorite food?

182
00:12:42,660 --> 00:12:43,390
Loquat.

183
00:12:45,090 --> 00:12:52,000
The one who answered "loquat" was Aoki-san, who has lived in Iwai for more than 70 years.
What's her 2nd recommendation for this town?

184
00:12:52,700 --> 00:12:55,470
- A shop selling sweets made from loquat is located along Iwai Beach.
- Sound's good!

185
00:12:55,870 --> 00:12:57,470
What was the name of the shop?

186
00:12:57,470 --> 00:12:59,040
It's Takayama Confectionery.

187
00:13:01,840 --> 00:13:02,880
Takayama Confectionery?

188
00:13:03,280 --> 00:13:04,480
Thank you!

189
00:13:04,710 --> 00:13:06,780
I heard there is a famous loquat sweets.

190
00:13:07,050 --> 00:13:15,890
The old lady at the store there told me about the famous loquat sweets at a shop called Takayama Confectionery.

191
00:13:17,090 --> 00:13:19,990
We should go there.
This town is famous for loquat.

192
00:13:20,730 --> 00:13:24,900
- So, shall we go to the place that sells the famous loquat sweets?
- Yes! Let's go there.

193
00:13:25,800 --> 00:13:30,000
They headed to Takayama Confectionery for the loquat sweets she told them about.

194
00:13:31,640 --> 00:13:34,610
- This is a nice town, isn't it?
- Yes, it's a peaceful town.

195
00:13:35,510 --> 00:13:36,410
Yeah.

196
00:13:37,950 --> 00:13:39,550
Where is Tanaka from?

197
00:13:40,010 --> 00:13:42,750
I'm from Toyonaka City in Osaka.

198
00:13:43,220 --> 00:13:44,420
Who else does come from there?

199
00:13:44,420 --> 00:13:49,520
Takashi Fujii is also from that neighborhood.

200
00:13:51,790 --> 00:13:55,200
- There are many comedians who are from that area.
- Yes!

201
00:13:56,130 --> 00:13:57,360
Right.

202
00:13:57,360 --> 00:14:04,000
- What about Hyogo?
- Surprisingly, there are not that many. Not even in Amagasaki.

203
00:14:05,040 --> 00:14:06,940
But there are a lot of actresses from there.

204
00:14:06,940 --> 00:14:09,080
- Where are they from?
- Hyogo.

205
00:14:09,080 --> 00:14:11,080
Many actresses are from Hyogo.

206
00:14:11,080 --> 00:14:12,450
Keiko Kitagawa.

207
00:14:12,550 --> 00:14:13,850
Yeah.

208
00:14:13,850 --> 00:14:14,880
Saki Aibu.

209
00:14:17,690 --> 00:14:19,650
Yoko Minamino.

210
00:14:19,990 --> 00:14:21,890
- Is the same true of Yoko Minamino?
- Yeah.

211
00:14:23,660 --> 00:14:24,890
Mako Ishino.

212
00:14:27,190 --> 00:14:28,860
Yoko Ishino.

213
00:14:31,330 --> 00:14:32,500
Those two are sisters.

214
00:14:34,030 --> 00:14:38,370
They are taking the world by storm.

215
00:14:39,610 --> 00:14:43,410
And the car arrived near Takayama Confectionery.

216
00:14:45,510 --> 00:14:46,750
Have we arrived?

217
00:14:46,910 --> 00:14:47,820
Here we are!

218
00:14:48,680 --> 00:14:51,020
It was called Sunada, right?

219
00:14:51,820 --> 00:14:52,920
What's Sunada?

220
00:14:52,920 --> 00:14:54,190
The loquat sweets shop.

221
00:14:54,760 --> 00:14:55,860
The shop is over there.

222
00:14:57,760 --> 00:15:01,330
No one said anything about the Sunada!!

223
00:15:02,360 --> 00:15:04,800
It says "Sunada Guest House".

224
00:15:04,970 --> 00:15:06,170
"Here we are!"

225
00:15:08,500 --> 00:15:10,400
You're a mess.

226
00:15:10,840 --> 00:15:13,340
- What was the name of the shop again?
- Takayama Confectionery.

227
00:15:13,710 --> 00:15:16,210
Oh, it's a tasteful.

228
00:15:16,840 --> 00:15:18,210
It says "loquat buns".

229
00:15:19,450 --> 00:15:22,520
Tanaka, you go run to the shop and ask for permission to shoot!

230
00:15:23,820 --> 00:15:27,090
- You are asking me to help, right?
- Are you going to make us wait?

231
00:15:28,160 --> 00:15:30,120
You are asking me to help, right?

232
00:15:30,490 --> 00:15:32,390
You really surprise me.

233
00:15:33,330 --> 00:15:37,560
They asked the shopkeeper for permission to shoot and went inside the shop.

234
00:15:37,870 --> 00:15:39,870
Hi!

235
00:15:41,940 --> 00:15:43,900
Sorry to interrupt.

236
00:15:44,270 --> 00:15:46,810
What kind of sweets do you recommend?

237
00:15:47,210 --> 00:15:50,340
Is this loquat bun a specialty?

238
00:15:50,340 --> 00:15:55,620
There is a mixture of loquat and white bean paste in this one.

239
00:15:55,620 --> 00:15:58,420
- Is that the specialty of this shop?
- Yes, it's.

240
00:15:59,020 --> 00:16:01,420
- Is this what that old lady was talking about?
- Yes.

241
00:16:02,160 --> 00:16:03,960
We will buy this one.

242
00:16:05,230 --> 00:16:06,730
How long has this shop been in business?

243
00:16:07,360 --> 00:16:14,470
- It's been in business since my father and grandfather, since the Taisho era.
- Taisho era!?

244
00:16:15,540 --> 00:16:19,210
They were asking the third generation owner about the store.
Then...

245
00:16:21,940 --> 00:16:22,980
Here he comes!

246
00:16:23,440 --> 00:16:25,180
I'm shocked you could made it.

247
00:16:26,380 --> 00:16:27,610
You didn't have to come.

248
00:16:27,610 --> 00:16:28,620
Hey, Hamada-san.

249
00:16:29,850 --> 00:16:33,220
I'm sure you guys were very lucky to win that rock-paper-scissors.

250
00:16:33,390 --> 00:16:35,990
- My knees are still shaking.
- Seriously?

251
00:16:36,120 --> 00:16:37,120
The slope from...

252
00:16:37,490 --> 00:16:38,090
Sorry, mister.

253
00:16:38,160 --> 00:16:40,190
The slope from there was terrible.

254
00:16:40,630 --> 00:16:44,000
I was just talking to Mister, so I don't need to talk about it anymore.

255
00:16:44,000 --> 00:16:45,770
I don't care about your story!

256
00:16:47,070 --> 00:16:49,840
You're in the wrong place at the wrong time.

257
00:16:50,100 --> 00:16:52,510
I feel sorry for the mister he was just talking to.

258
00:16:53,970 --> 00:16:58,180
They ate the shop's recommendation of loquat buns.

259
00:16:59,380 --> 00:17:00,880
It's delish!

260
00:17:01,520 --> 00:17:03,820
- You were craving sugar, right?
- That's really true.

261
00:17:04,650 --> 00:17:05,320
Yummy!

262
00:17:05,320 --> 00:17:06,250
Really so.

263
00:17:06,390 --> 00:17:07,720
It has a slightly sour taste.

264
00:17:10,120 --> 00:17:23,340
This loquat bun is a famous confectionery representing Minami-Boso, made from loquat produced in Minami-Boso, jammed with just enough loquat grains to remain, and baked with white bean paste and kneaded loquat paste in a sponge cake.

265
00:17:24,470 --> 00:17:30,940
So, the 2nd recommendation around Iwai Station is recognized as Loquat Manju of Takayama Confectionery !

266
00:17:32,850 --> 00:17:36,720
They asked the clerk for the 1st recommended place.

267
00:17:37,020 --> 00:17:42,820
Is there anywhere around here you recommend we should go?

268
00:17:43,560 --> 00:17:44,560
What places do you recommend?

269
00:17:46,360 --> 00:17:53,170
What is the 1st recommended place for Shingo Takayama, the 4th generation owner of Takayama Confectionery, who was born and raised in Iwai?

270
00:17:53,530 --> 00:17:56,200
It can be anywhere.

271
00:17:56,200 --> 00:17:56,970
The sunset is...

272
00:17:58,540 --> 00:18:00,510
- Beautiful sunset?
- Yes.

273
00:18:02,580 --> 00:18:03,940
Where should we watch it from?

274
00:18:03,940 --> 00:18:05,280
Is it okay if the 1st place is the sunset?

275
00:18:06,150 --> 00:18:07,780
Is it okay ?

276
00:18:08,820 --> 00:18:11,950
Matsumoto was worried.
Then ...

277
00:18:12,720 --> 00:18:22,400
Iwai beach is also good, but there is a famous pier on Haraoka beach, about 10 minutes away by car.

278
00:18:22,860 --> 00:18:25,800
That is a popular spot.

279
00:18:26,100 --> 00:18:27,670
It sounds good.

280
00:18:27,670 --> 00:18:29,500
So, the 1st place is the pier?

281
00:18:29,500 --> 00:18:33,610
Yes, it's a wooden pier.

282
00:18:33,610 --> 00:18:40,810
- But let's go back to the front of the station and ask God, too.
- No,no, no, no, no!

283
00:18:40,950 --> 00:18:42,120
Who is God?

284
00:18:42,120 --> 00:18:43,250
I mean the Golden God.

285
00:18:44,120 --> 00:18:46,520
No, no, no, no, that's enough!

286
00:18:47,320 --> 00:18:50,390
- Let's go to the pier.
- Yeah!

287
00:18:50,460 --> 00:18:52,790
Thank you!

288
00:19:01,870 --> 00:19:07,940
They were headed for Haraoka Beach, where there was a wooden pier.

289
00:19:08,540 --> 00:19:10,640
Finally, we can go to the 1st recommended place.

290
00:19:10,640 --> 00:19:13,750
Yes, a lot has happened today.

291
00:19:15,020 --> 00:19:16,520
Endo, do you know why you lost rock-paper-scissors?

292
00:19:16,520 --> 00:19:17,920
The reason I lost?

293
00:19:18,120 --> 00:19:22,560
I tried to think about it, but I couldn't figure it out either.

294
00:19:22,760 --> 00:19:24,530
Endo, you are an idiot.

295
00:19:24,630 --> 00:19:30,960
After we said, "first comes rock," we all definitely thought you would make a move other than rock.

296
00:19:30,960 --> 00:19:32,070
Is this serious?

297
00:19:32,500 --> 00:19:34,870
I played scissors both times and lost.

298
00:19:35,970 --> 00:19:39,170
So I'm confident that I can play rock-paper-scissors with Endo and not lose.

299
00:19:39,170 --> 00:19:40,240
Really?

300
00:19:40,640 --> 00:19:43,040
I might lose to you the first turn.

301
00:19:43,140 --> 00:19:45,750
But from the next turn, I can read your moves.

302
00:19:45,750 --> 00:19:50,180
From the second turn, I'm confident that I can beat you five times in a row.

303
00:19:50,180 --> 00:19:52,120
- Okay, let's play.
- Sure.

304
00:19:52,990 --> 00:19:54,120
Don't count the first turn

305
00:19:54,120 --> 00:19:56,260
Yes.

306
00:19:56,760 --> 00:19:58,560
First comes rock, rock-paper-scissors.

307
00:19:59,060 --> 00:20:01,630
- See, I told you.
- Yes.

308
00:20:02,230 --> 00:20:03,960
First comes rock, rock-paper-scissors.

309
00:20:04,200 --> 00:20:05,400
See?

310
00:20:05,400 --> 00:20:06,400
I won.

311
00:20:06,700 --> 00:20:08,370
I explained it the other way around.

312
00:20:08,640 --> 00:20:10,070
You explained it the other way around?

313
00:20:10,440 --> 00:20:13,310
- I won.
- Because I explained it the other way around.

314
00:20:13,410 --> 00:20:15,710
I was trying to tell you that I was definitely going to lose.

315
00:20:18,350 --> 00:20:21,010
My explanation was the other way around.

316
00:20:21,010 --> 00:20:23,780
I see.
The exact opposite of the explanation you gave happened.

317
00:20:23,780 --> 00:20:25,990
He played the same move twice in a row.

318
00:20:27,390 --> 00:20:28,820
And he lost.

319
00:20:29,760 --> 00:20:33,190
Yeah, what I said was not wrong.

320
00:20:33,390 --> 00:20:36,760
There's nothing wrong with this.
My explanation was the other way around.

321
00:20:37,700 --> 00:20:40,130
I don't think it's necessary to explain it the other way around.

322
00:20:40,530 --> 00:20:44,370
On the one hand, there is that way of thinking.

323
00:20:46,610 --> 00:20:51,010
This is a different atmosphere from that beach.

324
00:20:53,180 --> 00:20:54,580
Is that the pier?

325
00:20:55,120 --> 00:20:57,380
It's here!

326
00:20:57,780 --> 00:21:01,460
- Is that the pier?
- That's good, isn't it?

327
00:21:02,790 --> 00:21:05,960
Is that the pier?

328
00:21:05,990 --> 00:21:07,760
Wouldn't it be nice to walk there?

329
00:21:09,460 --> 00:21:16,070
They parked their car near the first recommended pier and walked to it.

330
00:21:16,640 --> 00:21:19,070
- It was cooler.
- It's just the perfect temperature.

331
00:21:20,010 --> 00:21:22,580
It's like simeppoi.

332
00:21:22,580 --> 00:21:23,880
Simeppoi(Gloomy) ?

333
00:21:24,780 --> 00:21:28,920
This is "simeppoi," which means appropriate for the last.

334
00:21:28,920 --> 00:21:33,020
That "Simeppoi" will definitely come across wrong.

335
00:21:43,130 --> 00:21:46,530
Finally they came to the pier, the 1st recommended place.

336
00:21:47,500 --> 00:21:50,070
Isn't this great?

337
00:21:51,040 --> 00:21:55,710
- And it says you can see Mt. Fuji from here.
- Yes.

338
00:21:55,710 --> 00:21:56,640
Fujimi-no-oka.
(A hill with a view of Mt. Fuji.)

339
00:21:57,510 --> 00:21:58,950
The picture is on the back of the sign.

340
00:21:59,380 --> 00:22:04,920
It seems you can see Mt. Fuji from the front here.

341
00:22:04,920 --> 00:22:07,390
This is great.

342
00:22:07,390 --> 00:22:09,420
But we can't see it at all today.

343
00:22:09,420 --> 00:22:11,890
But aren't we awesome?

344
00:22:11,890 --> 00:22:13,630
You are so excited.

345
00:22:14,160 --> 00:22:16,160
Why are you so excited?

346
00:22:16,360 --> 00:22:18,830
Well, it's great, of course.

347
00:22:19,430 --> 00:22:23,340
- Don't you think it's great?
- I know, but...

348
00:22:23,940 --> 00:22:26,170
It's got a retro vibe.

349
00:22:26,770 --> 00:22:30,310
Look, it's made of wood.

350
00:22:35,220 --> 00:22:38,390
- I'm glad she told me about this.
- Really so.

351
00:22:39,620 --> 00:22:40,950
This is good.

352
00:22:42,420 --> 00:22:44,290
This is great.

353
00:22:44,290 --> 00:22:47,390
This deserves 1st place.

354
00:22:47,390 --> 00:22:50,600
It's nice to walk on the pier.

355
00:22:51,930 --> 00:22:57,400
Okamoto Pier is one of the few wooden piers in Japan.

356
00:22:58,540 --> 00:23:01,880
it's a popular spot to watch the sunset with a spectacular view.

357
00:23:05,180 --> 00:23:13,350
And when the sun goes down, the bare bulbs on the pier light up and you can enjoy the retro vibe.

358
00:23:16,160 --> 00:23:21,860
Okamoto Pier on Haraoka Beach was recognized as the 1st recommended place around Iwai Station!

359
00:23:22,360 --> 00:23:25,470
This is the results.

360
00:23:25,800 --> 00:23:27,970
This was tough.

361
00:23:28,640 --> 00:23:30,900
My knees are still shaking.

362
00:23:30,900 --> 00:23:32,910
Mt. Tomi was recommended by many people.

363
00:23:33,010 --> 00:23:35,810
Everyone recommended this place.

364
00:23:35,810 --> 00:23:38,040
We didn't get to see that view.

365
00:23:38,810 --> 00:23:40,050
Please watch it on the air.

366
00:23:40,050 --> 00:23:42,850
- Let's broadcast that footage in picture-in-picture.
- What the hell!

367
00:23:44,580 --> 00:23:46,220
I worked hard though...

368
00:23:47,990 --> 00:23:54,690
