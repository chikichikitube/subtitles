00:00:00,060 --> 00:00:03,820
Laying Eggs

3
00:00:04,500 --> 00:00:05,820
Koji-san
- Yes?

4
00:00:06,220 --> 00:00:09,060
Flying to Macau is so fun

5
00:00:09,060 --> 00:00:09,580
Yeah

6
00:00:09,860 --> 00:00:12,060
It will be so much fun with lots of things to do!

7
00:00:12,060 --> 00:00:13,980
Really?
Oh no!

8
00:00:13,980 --> 00:00:15,140
What's wrong Yuuko-chan?

9
00:00:15,380 --> 00:00:17,220
I forgot my passport

10
00:00:17,220 --> 00:00:17,780
As soon as we mention it,

11
00:00:18,140 --> 00:00:19,100
Happening!
- Happening!

12
00:00:21,620 --> 00:00:23,660
By the way Yuuko-chan, take a look

13
00:00:22,500 --> 00:00:22,860
Huh?

14
00:00:24,140 --> 00:00:24,860
The window frame

15
00:00:25,140 --> 00:00:26,020
The window frame?

16
00:00:26,620 --> 00:00:27,180
It's gray

17
00:00:27,980 --> 00:00:28,980
Yes, it really is

18
00:00:29,100 --> 00:00:30,660
Good gray, huh... Especially the top left

19
00:00:31,380 --> 00:00:32,140
Over here?

20
00:00:32,260 --> 00:00:32,780
Yes

21
00:00:33,060 --> 00:00:34,180
Shall we touch there together?

22
00:00:35,060 --> 00:00:35,420
Yes..

23
00:00:35,860 --> 00:00:36,740
Here we go

24
00:00:39,460 --> 00:00:40,260
Koji-san

25
00:00:40,340 --> 00:00:40,940
OK, right?

26
00:00:41,980 --> 00:00:42,740
Koji-san

27
00:00:42,740 --> 00:00:44,060
I really like you

28
00:00:44,460 --> 00:00:45,860
Koji-san! Look!

29
00:00:45,860 --> 00:00:46,900
What happened?

30
00:00:46,900 --> 00:00:47,940
Is this...?

31
00:00:49,300 --> 00:00:50,020
Fish man

32
00:00:52,340 --> 00:00:53,460
But, it's OK Yuuko-chan

33
00:00:53,580 --> 00:00:54,140
Huh?

34
00:00:54,140 --> 00:00:55,500
Fish man is outside

35
00:00:56,060 --> 00:00:57,380
Let's continue

36
00:00:57,580 --> 00:01:00,220
But people are watching...

37
00:01:00,220 --> 00:01:01,300
They don't care

38
00:01:01,300 --> 00:01:02,220
Koji-san!

39
00:01:03,140 --> 00:01:04,060
How is it, Yuuko-chan?

40
00:01:04,060 --> 00:01:04,780
Koji-san

41
00:01:04,780 --> 00:01:06,380
Even though were in a place like this

42
00:01:06,780 --> 00:01:07,940
Koji-san!

43
00:01:07,940 --> 00:01:08,460
What's wrong?

44
00:01:08,900 --> 00:01:10,180
Look!

45
00:01:10,820 --> 00:01:12,180
You stupid!

46
00:01:12,180 --> 00:01:13,660
What are you trying to do!

47
00:01:13,940 --> 00:01:15,460
Yuuko-chan, let's go!

48
00:01:15,500 --> 00:01:15,980
OK!

49
00:01:18,220 --> 00:01:19,300
Hey!

50
00:01:19,940 --> 00:01:21,300
Fish man!

51
00:01:21,660 --> 00:01:22,900
What the hell are you doing?

52
00:01:26,860 --> 00:01:28,140
Give me a break!

53
00:01:31,780 --> 00:01:34,780
"Let me give birth"

54
00:01:35,620 --> 00:01:36,660
I don't care!

55
00:01:41,460 --> 00:01:43,220
What are you doing to my Yuuko-chan!

56
00:01:44,180 --> 00:01:44,860
Hey

57
00:01:48,540 --> 00:01:49,820
You bastard!

58
00:01:50,540 --> 00:01:51,540
Damn it

59
00:01:52,100 --> 00:01:54,500
Die!

60
00:01:56,900 --> 00:01:58,580
I did it, Yuuko-chan!

61
00:01:59,100 --> 00:02:01,100
I did it!!

62
00:02:02,500 --> 00:02:05,100
I killed Fish man!
