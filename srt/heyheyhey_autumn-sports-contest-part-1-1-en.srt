HEY!HEY!HEY! Music Champ!

00:00:18,560 --> 00:00:22,730
HEY!HEY!HEY! Autumn's Red/White
Huge Sports Contest!!

7
00:00:27,770 --> 00:00:28,810
Onegaishimasu

8
00:00:29,870 --> 00:00:33,110
Makihara Toshiyuki

9
00:00:32,140 --> 00:00:34,010
Well, here we are again!

10
00:00:33,710 --> 00:00:36,910
Hamada Masatoshi/Matsumoto Hitoshi

11
00:00:34,010 --> 00:00:36,850
This time, it's a huge athletic meet

12
00:00:36,850 --> 00:00:40,280
and these bad people here,
this group still remembers

13
00:00:40,280 --> 00:00:42,150
so this time they're determined to win.

14
00:00:42,150 --> 00:00:43,650
So they want to do it a second time!

15
00:00:43,650 --> 00:00:46,690
The "We-were-scared-but-now-we-powered-up", Red Group.

16
00:00:46,690 --> 00:00:49,230
Team Morning Musume!!

17
00:00:57,730 --> 00:01:03,470
Down by 400 points, but could have had a upset victory, it's Morning Musume!

18
00:01:04,710 --> 00:01:06,210
This time, new members have come!

19
00:01:06,210 --> 00:01:09,280
At an average age of 15.9, these 13 members are quite young!

20
00:01:09,280 --> 00:01:11,480
They've vowed revenge!

21
00:01:12,580 --> 00:01:17,290
This time, the new leader, Iida Kaori-san
is making her appearance.

22
00:01:16,590 --> 00:01:18,820
The new members... where are they?

23
00:01:17,290 --> 00:01:19,050
They're in front.

24
00:01:19,050 --> 00:01:20,960
The new members... these four.

25
00:01:20,960 --> 00:01:23,160
Let's have a little intro from
Iida-san about then.

26
00:01:22,120 --> 00:01:23,830
They look really scared right now.

27
00:01:23,830 --> 00:01:24,790
You guys okay?

28
00:01:24,790 --> 00:01:26,000
Umm...

29
00:01:27,200 --> 00:01:29,670
These four are the fifth generation.

30
00:01:29,670 --> 00:01:31,170
Please introduce yourselves.

31
00:01:31,570 --> 00:01:32,940
I'm Takahashi Ai.

32
00:01:32,940 --> 00:01:34,270
I'm 15.

33
00:01:34,800 --> 00:01:36,340
Yoroshiku onegaishimasu.

34
00:01:41,510 --> 00:01:43,350
I'm Konno Asami.

35
00:01:43,350 --> 00:01:44,810
I'm 14.

36
00:01:44,810 --> 00:01:46,250
Yoroshiku onegaishimasu.

37
00:01:46,250 --> 00:01:47,050
Asami-chan?

38
00:01:50,620 --> 00:01:52,720
I'm Ogawa Makoto and I'm 13.

39
00:01:52,720 --> 00:01:54,160
Yoroshiku onegaishimasu.

40
00:01:57,490 --> 00:01:58,130
Lastly...

41
00:01:58,130 --> 00:01:59,830
I'm Niigaki Risa and I'm 12.

42
00:01:59,830 --> 00:02:01,200
Yoroshiku onegaishimasu!

43
00:02:01,200 --> 00:02:02,300
She's 12.

44
00:02:04,870 --> 00:02:06,400
Amazing isn't it? She's 12.

45
00:02:06,930 --> 00:02:09,100
Their teeth are really chattering though.

46
00:02:09,970 --> 00:02:12,610
You could really feel the pressure
from the back there.

47
00:02:12,010 --> 00:02:13,970
How is it everyone? Truthfully...

48
00:02:13,970 --> 00:02:15,280
Please do really well okay?

49
00:02:15,280 --> 00:02:17,980
So since Morning Musume has increased to 13 members

50
00:02:17,980 --> 00:02:19,880
and Downtown is just the two of you,

51
00:02:19,880 --> 00:02:22,920
so the number of people
seems a bit unfair right?

52
00:02:22,180 --> 00:02:25,590
For us, we really don't need any helpers.

53
00:02:24,950 --> 00:02:26,420
Is that right?

54
00:02:25,850 --> 00:02:27,590
So the two of us is enough to battle.

55
00:02:27,590 --> 00:02:29,920
Last time we had four people helping?

56
00:02:29,920 --> 00:02:31,460
Four people right?

57
00:02:29,990 --> 00:02:31,630
That was an even show.

58
00:02:31,460 --> 00:02:32,560
That right?

59
00:02:32,160 --> 00:02:34,430
They were the red and we were the white.

60
00:02:34,430 --> 00:02:35,260
Right right right.

61
00:02:35,260 --> 00:02:36,460
There's 13 of them right?

62
00:02:36,460 --> 00:02:37,400
Yep, 13 of them.

63
00:02:36,860 --> 00:02:38,100
And it's just two of us.

64
00:02:38,300 --> 00:02:39,570
Well, anyway...

65
00:02:40,000 --> 00:02:41,030
...please call them.

66
00:02:40,100 --> 00:02:43,700
We've called on a lot of strong assistants!

67
00:02:43,700 --> 00:02:46,010
So now let's bring them out!

68
00:02:46,010 --> 00:02:48,170
The white group! Team Downtown!

69
00:02:54,580 --> 00:02:58,250
First up, a performer who never fails
at anything athletic, it's Hiromi Go!

70
00:02:58,780 --> 00:03:02,990
Adding in his skills with Downtown,
it's Kawamura Ryuuichi!

71
00:03:02,990 --> 00:03:06,360
Skillful dancing and explosive
power, it's DA PUMP!

72
00:03:06,360 --> 00:03:09,930
Balancing out with the other
young ones, it's w-inds!

73
00:03:09,930 --> 00:03:13,770
Ready to help out in his sparkling
silver, it's DanceMan!

74
00:03:14,870 --> 00:03:17,570
Ours are pretty great!

75
00:03:16,600 --> 00:03:18,140
They're really amazing!

76
00:03:18,140 --> 00:03:20,710
Speaking of athletic meets,
it's totally Go Hiromi right?

77
00:03:21,070 --> 00:03:22,110
Awesome isn't it?

78
00:03:22,110 --> 00:03:24,310
"He's a Pendant Killer!"

79
00:03:24,310 --> 00:03:27,810
Hiromi is good, but DanceMan
I don't think we need!

80
00:03:28,350 --> 00:03:29,910
Who is this guy? DanceMan...

81
00:03:30,720 --> 00:03:32,650
Think he can fight in that!?

82
00:03:32,980 --> 00:03:34,920
At least he's wearing his track jacket.

83
00:03:34,920 --> 00:03:37,020
And so, Hiromi Go will start off...

84
00:03:37,390 --> 00:03:41,160
I'm sure it was easy for you before, but how long
has it been since you've done a sports contest?

85
00:03:41,160 --> 00:03:41,730
A while right?

86
00:03:41,730 --> 00:03:42,630
A sports contest right?

87
00:03:42,630 --> 00:03:45,100
When I'm training, I was exercising
three times a week so...

88
00:03:45,100 --> 00:03:46,030
I see.

89
00:03:46,030 --> 00:03:46,560
I'll be all right.

90
00:03:46,560 --> 00:03:49,430
So umm... what's Hiromi
Go-san good at exactly?

91
00:03:49,830 --> 00:03:51,300
Well...

92
00:03:51,300 --> 00:03:52,440
things like ball-tossing...

93
00:03:54,040 --> 00:03:55,470
Well I have endurance so...

94
00:03:56,110 --> 00:03:58,780
But will your forty-year-old
shoulder pain be okay?

95
00:04:00,780 --> 00:04:02,210
So this time...

96
00:04:01,750 --> 00:04:03,150
It's okay. I'm good at running.

97
00:04:03,150 --> 00:04:04,850
Ah, running is good then.

98
00:04:04,850 --> 00:04:07,850
After recording this HEY!HEY!HEY!,
he'll take a small vacation.

99
00:04:08,450 --> 00:04:09,920
Eh? Where to?

100
00:04:09,920 --> 00:04:11,220
He'll be going to America.

101
00:04:11,220 --> 00:04:12,790
Ah, so you're working after this!?

102
00:04:12,790 --> 00:04:14,020
Some admirable work.

103
00:04:15,260 --> 00:04:16,590
Just like HEY!HEY!HEY! right?

104
00:04:18,560 --> 00:04:21,330
Kawamura-san told us he actively
participates in bowling competitions,

105
00:04:21,330 --> 00:04:22,970
but what about sports contests?

106
00:04:22,970 --> 00:04:24,030
Well...

107
00:04:24,030 --> 00:04:27,540
I haven't done any exercising lately but

108
00:04:27,970 --> 00:04:28,940
today I'll...

109
00:04:28,400 --> 00:04:30,210
Talk a little louder!

110
00:04:30,610 --> 00:04:33,040
If you talk louder, the mic wouldn't
have to be so close!

111
00:04:33,140 --> 00:04:36,880
Microphone

112
00:04:33,640 --> 00:04:35,580
Umm... today...

113
00:04:36,050 --> 00:04:39,380
how much is Downtown gonna
keep pulling my leg?

114
00:04:40,050 --> 00:04:42,080
And then, everyone from Da Pump,

115
00:04:42,080 --> 00:04:44,550
when they begin a sports contest,
their fighting spirit increases!

116
00:04:44,550 --> 00:04:45,790
It really does!

117
00:04:45,790 --> 00:04:47,790
They'll show us how hard they try.

118
00:04:47,790 --> 00:04:50,660
And then, your young brothers
over there, w-inds, also...

119
00:04:50,660 --> 00:04:52,130
We're really full of energy!

120
00:04:52,130 --> 00:04:52,660
Huh?

121
00:04:52,660 --> 00:04:53,500
We're energetic.

122
00:04:53,500 --> 00:04:54,400
What are you energetic about?

123
00:04:54,400 --> 00:04:55,730
The sports contest...

124
00:04:55,730 --> 00:04:57,300
This okay? Da Pump...

125
00:04:58,370 --> 00:04:59,970
It's good that they're talking like that.

126
00:04:59,970 --> 00:05:01,370
If it goes down, we're blaming you.

127
00:05:01,370 --> 00:05:02,400
Don't let it.

128
00:05:02,940 --> 00:05:05,240
And then there's the question, "Can
he even do a sports contest?"

129
00:05:05,240 --> 00:05:06,740
We'd like to ask DanceMan.

130
00:05:07,140 --> 00:05:07,910
Onegaishimasu!

131
00:05:07,910 --> 00:05:09,410
So now we'd like to do the Player's Oath.

132
00:05:09,410 --> 00:05:11,380
White group captain, Hamada-san!

133
00:05:11,380 --> 00:05:13,250
And the Red group captain, Iida Kaori-san!

134
00:05:13,250 --> 00:05:14,550
If you please!

135
00:05:16,150 --> 00:05:32,470
Player's Oath

136
00:05:17,820 --> 00:05:18,650
Ready... and...

137
00:05:18,650 --> 00:05:19,750
Sensei!

138
00:05:19,750 --> 00:05:23,060
We take the role of sportsmanship leaders!

139
00:05:23,060 --> 00:05:26,460
And vow to compete fairly and honestly!

140
00:05:26,460 --> 00:05:29,300
Red Group captain, Iida Kaori!

141
00:05:28,830 --> 00:05:31,270
White Group captain, Hamada Masatoshi!

142
00:05:36,200 --> 00:05:39,370
Battle #1! Ball-toss!

143
00:05:48,250 --> 00:05:51,220
Well, Go Hiromi-san told
us this was his specialty.

144
00:05:51,220 --> 00:05:52,090
Ball-tossing...

145
00:05:52,090 --> 00:05:53,620
The fewest number will lose.

146
00:05:53,620 --> 00:05:56,060
That's right! And doesn't that
side have fewer balls?

147
00:05:56,060 --> 00:05:56,790
Think so?

148
00:05:56,790 --> 00:05:59,190
Everyone made two a piece
by themselves at home?

149
00:06:00,930 --> 00:06:02,730
Me and Hamada made some
and brought them!

150
00:06:03,160 --> 00:06:04,600
At your own expense!?

151
00:06:05,230 --> 00:06:07,230
Made them yourself didn't you?

152
00:06:07,230 --> 00:06:10,140
Go-san, what's the key
to getting the balls in?

153
00:06:09,370 --> 00:06:10,240
Hiromi Go!

154
00:06:10,140 --> 00:06:11,300
Well, it's concentration.

155
00:06:11,300 --> 00:06:12,510
Concentration?

156
00:06:13,340 --> 00:06:15,310
Eh? This requires concentration?

157
00:06:15,310 --> 00:06:16,510
Yep, concentration.

158
00:06:16,040 --> 00:06:18,310
Well, the White Group has DanceMan right?

159
00:06:18,310 --> 00:06:20,650
He's tall so it might be easier for him.

160
00:06:18,510 --> 00:06:20,450
That's true. He's got height.

161
00:06:21,010 --> 00:06:23,250
And on this side, the Red Group...

162
00:06:23,250 --> 00:06:24,980
you don't have much height do you?

163
00:06:24,980 --> 00:06:26,420
That's true.

164
00:06:25,380 --> 00:06:26,820
It's kinda de opposite isn't it?

165
00:06:26,890 --> 00:06:27,690
However...

166
00:06:27,690 --> 00:06:30,060
we're young, so our speed might be...

167
00:06:30,420 --> 00:06:31,620
enough to get them in.

168
00:06:31,620 --> 00:06:34,590
They have a lot of unknowns...
Morning Musume.

169
00:06:34,590 --> 00:06:35,790
So we don't know.

170
00:06:35,490 --> 00:06:37,500
- 1st Game -

171
00:06:35,490 --> 00:06:37,500
Ball-toss

172
00:06:37,730 --> 00:06:39,200
Ready...

173
00:06:43,170 --> 00:06:45,900
Both teams are throwing nicely.

174
00:06:45,900 --> 00:06:48,810
The White Group seems
to be a little faster.

175
00:06:48,810 --> 00:06:51,440
The White Group looks like they're
throwing a little quicker.

176
00:06:51,440 --> 00:06:53,140
Lots of cheering.

177
00:06:53,140 --> 00:06:55,050
The Red Group has good control.

178
00:06:55,050 --> 00:06:57,950
Everyone in Morning Musume
is giving their best!

179
00:06:58,980 --> 00:07:01,490
White Group? Red Group? Which will it be?

180
00:07:01,490 --> 00:07:02,850
Each team is getting them in.

181
00:07:02,850 --> 00:07:04,150
Eight seconds left!

182
00:07:04,150 --> 00:07:04,860
Seven seconds!

183
00:07:04,860 --> 00:07:05,490
6!

184
00:07:05,490 --> 00:07:06,260
5!

185
00:07:06,260 --> 00:07:07,120
4!

186
00:07:07,120 --> 00:07:07,830
3!

187
00:07:07,830 --> 00:07:08,630
2!

188
00:07:08,630 --> 00:07:09,760
1!

189
00:07:10,560 --> 00:07:12,200
And finished!

190
00:07:19,070 --> 00:07:20,370
We couldn't!

191
00:07:20,370 --> 00:07:23,170
Here we go! Ready...

192
00:07:23,170 --> 00:07:24,870
1!

193
00:07:24,870 --> 00:07:26,310
2!

194
00:07:26,310 --> 00:07:28,040
38!

195
00:07:28,040 --> 00:07:29,550
39!

196
00:07:29,550 --> 00:07:31,410
40!

197
00:07:31,410 --> 00:07:32,980
41!

198
00:07:32,980 --> 00:07:35,550
Morning Musume's basket is empty!

199
00:07:35,550 --> 00:07:36,620
Which means...!

200
00:07:37,790 --> 00:07:40,260
The White Group wins!

201
00:07:44,530 --> 00:07:46,560
The second game is a handicap match.

202
00:07:46,560 --> 00:07:48,160
Underneath A and B are balls,

203
00:07:48,160 --> 00:07:49,400
and you may only choose one.

204
00:07:49,400 --> 00:07:51,700
Under one are regular
balls... under the other

205
00:07:51,700 --> 00:07:54,200
are round things that aren't easy to toss!

206
00:07:54,200 --> 00:07:56,540
So now someone will choose first and

207
00:07:56,540 --> 00:07:57,870
let's go with ladies first.

208
00:07:57,870 --> 00:07:59,170
From the Red Group, Iida-san...

209
00:07:59,170 --> 00:08:00,810
please choose A or B.

210
00:08:00,810 --> 00:08:02,080
Either one?

211
00:08:01,680 --> 00:08:03,280
Either one is okay. Which
one will you choose?

212
00:08:03,280 --> 00:08:04,780
Which one I wonder?

213
00:08:06,580 --> 00:08:07,620
Which one should I do?

214
00:08:07,620 --> 00:08:09,150
Go with A.

215
00:08:09,150 --> 00:08:10,150
A!

216
00:08:10,150 --> 00:08:10,890
Okay... B!

217
00:08:12,820 --> 00:08:15,790
Then, please open up B!

218
00:08:16,490 --> 00:08:17,360
What's inside?

219
00:08:17,360 --> 00:08:18,430
Ordinary balls.

220
00:08:18,430 --> 00:08:20,260
So that is the Red Group's.

221
00:08:20,260 --> 00:08:21,030
Hamada-san...

222
00:08:21,030 --> 00:08:21,900
This one...

223
00:08:21,900 --> 00:08:24,630
So this is what White Team ends up with.

224
00:08:24,900 --> 00:08:29,470
Ibaraki Prefecture's highest grade chestnuts

225
00:08:26,330 --> 00:08:27,500
What's that?

226
00:08:30,370 --> 00:08:31,240
These are...

227
00:08:31,940 --> 00:08:35,910
These are the highest grade
chestnuts from Ibaraki!

228
00:08:34,580 --> 00:08:36,310
Wait wait... wait wait...

229
00:08:36,310 --> 00:08:38,980
This was 100% pre-arranged wasn't it!?

230
00:08:39,980 --> 00:08:41,920
No,no. It's just what she chose.

231
00:08:41,920 --> 00:08:44,450
So umm, from Ibaraki prefecture...

232
00:08:43,650 --> 00:08:44,850
This is too weird!

233
00:08:45,650 --> 00:08:48,190
Those pointy things will get in the way!

234
00:08:48,990 --> 00:08:50,420
Unbelievable!

235
00:08:50,420 --> 00:08:52,190
Yes, but...

236
00:08:51,560 --> 00:08:55,100
Kinda strange that they said, "A!" but
she went to the other one isn't it!?

237
00:08:55,560 --> 00:08:57,530
Absolutely 100% deliberate!

238
00:08:57,530 --> 00:09:00,330
So for these chestnuts,
the White Group will...

239
00:09:00,330 --> 00:09:01,600
Freaking unbelievable!

240
00:09:01,600 --> 00:09:02,800
Shut up!!

241
00:09:02,800 --> 00:09:07,940
So, if you win with your handicap,
you'll receive 200 points.

242
00:09:07,140 --> 00:09:09,540
Hold on a minute! Those are dangerous!

243
00:09:09,610 --> 00:09:12,050
Because if you throw and miss, then
the people on the other side

244
00:09:12,050 --> 00:09:16,250
might get hit in the head right?

245
00:09:16,250 --> 00:09:19,020
Can't believe you wanna do
the same thing with those!

246
00:09:19,020 --> 00:09:22,620
Of course, for the safety of the White
Group, we've prepared gloves and helmets.

247
00:09:22,620 --> 00:09:23,390
Is that acceptable?

248
00:09:23,390 --> 00:09:27,360
But... we're not talking about just the head...

249
00:09:27,760 --> 00:09:29,460
My shoulders could get hit! My shoulders!

250
00:09:30,460 --> 00:09:31,960
My flesh is still exposed!

251
00:09:32,830 --> 00:09:35,000
And now to get started
with the next battle!

252
00:09:35,000 --> 00:09:35,800
Ready...

253
00:09:35,800 --> 00:09:36,900
I'm getting worried.

254
00:09:39,340 --> 00:09:40,340
Don't hit them!

255
00:09:44,040 --> 00:09:45,910
Do your best!

256
00:09:45,910 --> 00:09:48,880
It's a little impossible with the chestnuts!

257
00:09:48,880 --> 00:09:51,750
The Red Group seems to be doing well.

258
00:09:51,750 --> 00:09:54,520
15 seconds left!

259
00:09:54,520 --> 00:09:58,320
The Red Group lost the last time but
that's not deterring them now!

260
00:09:58,320 --> 00:10:00,090
The White Group is doing their best as well!

261
00:10:00,090 --> 00:10:01,390
It's a close match!

262
00:10:02,160 --> 00:10:03,060
5 seconds left!

263
00:10:03,060 --> 00:10:03,660
4!

264
00:10:03,660 --> 00:10:04,430
3!

265
00:10:04,430 --> 00:10:05,160
2!

266
00:10:05,160 --> 00:10:06,630
1!

267
00:10:06,630 --> 00:10:08,600
And stop!

268
00:10:09,500 --> 00:10:10,900
Stop! Stop!

269
00:10:11,570 --> 00:10:14,070
This is no good!

270
00:10:14,640 --> 00:10:17,740
And anyway, Maki, did you
even throw one chestnut?

271
00:10:19,210 --> 00:10:21,110
So let's begin! Ready...

272
00:10:21,480 --> 00:10:22,480
1!

273
00:10:22,480 --> 00:10:24,380
Dangerous! Dangerous!

274
00:10:26,450 --> 00:10:28,150
Are you okay!?

275
00:10:28,150 --> 00:10:30,020
That guy! It was him!

276
00:10:30,020 --> 00:10:32,090
You hit her! You hit her!

277
00:10:32,090 --> 00:10:34,090
You hit a girl right before her wedding!!

278
00:10:35,730 --> 00:10:37,030
You should be upset!

279
00:10:40,530 --> 00:10:42,100
She doesn't even have a helmet!

280
00:10:43,170 --> 00:10:45,870
Please be carefull where you're throwing.

281
00:10:45,870 --> 00:10:47,370
So can we continue then?

282
00:10:48,070 --> 00:10:50,040
16!

283
00:10:50,040 --> 00:10:52,140
17!

284
00:10:52,140 --> 00:10:54,110
18!

285
00:10:54,110 --> 00:10:55,610
19!

286
00:10:56,180 --> 00:10:57,080
20!

287
00:10:57,080 --> 00:10:59,420
All together! 21!

288
00:10:59,950 --> 00:11:00,850
Ow! Ow!

289
00:11:00,850 --> 00:11:02,120
Wait! Wait! Wait!

290
00:11:02,550 --> 00:11:03,890
You did it again!

291
00:11:03,890 --> 00:11:05,120
You hit me!

292
00:11:06,160 --> 00:11:07,490
Before I'm married!

293
00:11:10,130 --> 00:11:11,260
So from 22!

294
00:11:11,260 --> 00:11:13,230
22!

295
00:11:13,930 --> 00:11:15,560
23!

296
00:11:15,560 --> 00:11:17,200
The White Group has no more!

297
00:11:17,200 --> 00:11:21,170
Which means, Morning
Musume is the winner!

298
00:11:30,580 --> 00:11:38,350
Please give me love... WA —

299
00:11:39,950 --> 00:11:43,860
Mr.Moonlight Up Side Down

300
00:11:45,160 --> 00:11:46,690
Mr. Moonlight

301
00:11:48,330 --> 00:11:51,100
A bit of a saucy young man

302
00:11:51,100 --> 00:11:53,700
With a bit of a lively step, going Up Side Down

303
00:11:53,700 --> 00:11:56,500
OH BABY BABY, tonight is to Up Swing

304
00:11:56,500 --> 00:12:00,340
Won't you dance with me? PARADISE

305
00:12:03,680 --> 00:12:06,780
But comparatively, he's a crybaby young man

306
00:12:06,780 --> 00:12:09,620
Everybody's a weak thing Up & Down

307
00:12:09,620 --> 00:12:12,320
OH BABY BABY tonight we're gonna Up Date

308
00:12:12,320 --> 00:12:14,590
Won't you sing with me? PARADISE

309
00:12:14,590 --> 00:12:17,590
OH! If it's my lover, I wanna

310
00:12:17,590 --> 00:12:19,860
keep close to them for 24 hours

311
00:12:19,860 --> 00:12:23,200
BUT! That won't become lady work

312
00:12:23,200 --> 00:12:25,400
Love is like a train that stops at each station

313
00:12:25,400 --> 00:12:27,930
It halts to a sudden stop and won't go on!

314
00:12:27,930 --> 00:12:30,740
(Mr. Moonlight) Gonna swear to you tonight

315
00:12:30,740 --> 00:12:33,270
(Mr. Moonlight) As much as I can

316
00:12:33,270 --> 00:12:38,440
(Mr. Moonlight) I'm gonna keep lovin' you

317
00:12:38,440 --> 00:12:42,680
And incessantly, smiles overflow

318
00:12:42,680 --> 00:12:46,790
For some reason, let's create happy days

319
00:12:46,790 --> 00:12:49,990
With all the power we've got

320
00:12:49,990 --> 00:12:53,060
And LaLaLa, affection overflows

321
00:12:53,060 --> 00:12:55,730
LaLaLa, let's sing a song

322
00:13:04,370 --> 00:13:07,510
"Oh! Are you saying your hearth is grieving?

323
00:13:07,510 --> 00:13:11,840
Ooh, BABY, that's love... love sickness.

324
00:13:11,840 --> 00:13:14,780
Surely, ever since you met me...

325
00:13:14,780 --> 00:13:16,510
You probably fell in love.

326
00:13:16,510 --> 00:13:19,680
Now, everything's okay now, I'm here,

327
00:13:19,680 --> 00:13:21,250
Come on, let's dance!"

328
00:13:21,250 --> 00:13:24,260
So young man, let's go without panic

329
00:13:24,260 --> 00:13:26,890
That's right, life is taken Step By Step

330
00:13:26,890 --> 00:13:29,460
Well, BABY BABY, tonight let's Forget

331
00:13:29,460 --> 00:13:32,030
Won't you dance with me? PARADISE

332
00:13:32,030 --> 00:13:34,930
OH! If it's my lover, I wanna kiss him

333
00:13:34,930 --> 00:13:37,230
AH! Wanna kiss and kiss him

334
00:13:37,230 --> 00:13:40,240
BUT they won't have the scent of a lemon

335
00:13:40,240 --> 00:13:42,840
Love at times can start quickly

336
00:13:42,840 --> 00:13:45,340
Love at times can break quickly!

337
00:13:45,340 --> 00:13:48,110
(Mr. Moonlight) Gonna swear to you

338
00:13:48,110 --> 00:13:50,680
(Mr. Moonlight) Perhaps, surely

339
00:13:50,680 --> 00:13:53,320
(Mr. Moonlight) I'm gonna keep lovin' you

340
00:13:58,620 --> 00:14:03,890
And LaLaLa, let's confirm

341
00:14:03,890 --> 00:14:06,000
LaLaLa, our affection today, too

342
00:14:20,480 --> 00:14:23,310
(Mr. Moonlight) Gonna promise tonight

343
00:14:23,310 --> 00:14:25,580
(Mr. Moonlight) As much as I can

344
00:14:25,580 --> 00:14:28,620
(Mr. Moonlight) I love you

345
00:14:28,620 --> 00:14:31,120
(Mr. Moonlight) Perhaps, surely

346
00:14:31,120 --> 00:14:33,860
(Mr. Moonlight) I love you

347
00:14:33,860 --> 00:14:36,160
(Mr. Moonlight) As much as I can

348
00:14:36,160 --> 00:14:39,030
(Mr. Moonlight) I'll keep on lovin' you

349
00:14:50,200 --> 00:14:54,940
Battle #2!
Three-legged obstacle course relay!

350
00:14:56,180 --> 00:14:58,910
In this battle, where two contestants
tied at the ankle

351
00:14:58,910 --> 00:15:00,980
must complete an obstacle course.

352
00:15:00,980 --> 00:15:03,520
At the start, the three-legged
team must crawl under a net,

353
00:15:03,520 --> 00:15:05,550
then grab a piece of bread off a string.

354
00:15:05,550 --> 00:15:07,490
Then the two must crawl through a ladder

355
00:15:07,490 --> 00:15:09,560
and then find and borrow whatever
item is on the paper.

356
00:15:09,560 --> 00:15:11,490
Once completed, they can switch
off to the next relay team.

357
00:15:11,490 --> 00:15:14,560
The winning team will be
rewarded 100 points!

358
00:15:15,660 --> 00:15:19,570
The batting order for the Red Group starts
with the shorties Tsuji Nozomi and Kago Ai...

359
00:15:19,570 --> 00:15:22,100
then the Ishikawa Rika and
Ogawa Makoto pair...

360
00:15:22,100 --> 00:15:24,600
Yoshizawa Hitomi and Niigaki Risa pair...

361
00:15:24,600 --> 00:15:27,040
Leader Iida Kaori and Takahashi Ai pair...

362
00:15:27,040 --> 00:15:28,880
then Abe Natsumi and Konno Asami pair!

363
00:15:28,880 --> 00:15:31,780
We'll see how well the old and new unite!

364
00:15:31,780 --> 00:15:35,320
On this side for the White Group, Go
Hiromi and Kawamura Ryuuichi will start...

365
00:15:35,320 --> 00:15:37,980
then the Shinobu and Yukinari
pair from Da Pump...

366
00:15:37,980 --> 00:15:40,990
Da Pump's Ken and w-ind's Ryohei...

367
00:15:40,990 --> 00:15:44,490
then w-ind's Keita and Ryuichi...

368
00:15:44,490 --> 00:15:49,800
lastly, it's DanceMan with Matsumoto
Hitoshi serving as anchor!

369
00:15:50,360 --> 00:15:53,600
So umm... why am I with DanceMan?

370
00:15:54,830 --> 00:15:56,240
"Why" you ask?

371
00:15:56,240 --> 00:15:58,100
The height difference is way off...

372
00:15:58,940 --> 00:16:02,370
and DanceMan... at least make
him take his boots off...

373
00:16:03,780 --> 00:16:06,580
And Iida-san, looking at these members...

374
00:16:06,580 --> 00:16:08,310
it's the new members and...

375
00:16:08,310 --> 00:16:11,980
are teamed up with the veteran
elder members, right?

376
00:16:11,980 --> 00:16:13,720
Was it planned out this way?

377
00:16:13,720 --> 00:16:15,150
That's right...

378
00:16:15,150 --> 00:16:16,820
we wanted one thing to happen...

379
00:16:16,820 --> 00:16:18,720
Morning Musume's power...

380
00:16:19,190 --> 00:16:20,430
I got it... right.

381
00:16:20,430 --> 00:16:24,130
Well, the pairing of the new members
with elders is pretty good.

382
00:16:24,130 --> 00:16:26,030
It's like their will are joined together.

383
00:16:26,030 --> 00:16:28,130
New members, please do your best!

384
00:16:28,130 --> 00:16:30,070
And the two that are going first,

385
00:16:30,070 --> 00:16:31,940
do your best even though you're smaller...

386
00:16:31,940 --> 00:16:33,770
Right? Small kids...

387
00:16:34,440 --> 00:16:35,870
Shorties, do you best okay?

388
00:16:36,440 --> 00:16:37,610
On your marks!

389
00:16:37,610 --> 00:16:38,840
Get set...

390
00:16:41,780 --> 00:16:44,010
Lot of speed at the start!

391
00:16:44,010 --> 00:16:46,920
The first is... it's both teams at the net!

392
00:16:46,920 --> 00:16:49,790
Red Group seems to have some
trouble... can they catch up?

393
00:16:50,390 --> 00:16:52,460
This pair is fighting hard!

394
00:16:52,460 --> 00:16:55,290
Here's Go Hiromi and Kawamura Ryuuichi!

395
00:16:55,290 --> 00:16:57,890
Good! That part is okay!

396
00:16:57,890 --> 00:17:00,000
Ah! They've gained a small lead!

397
00:17:00,830 --> 00:17:05,200
And now, they seem very
skilled... MoMusu okay!

398
00:17:06,040 --> 00:17:09,340
Well, the White Group's
at the item to borrow...

399
00:17:09,340 --> 00:17:12,010
The Red Group has just arrived!

400
00:17:12,010 --> 00:17:13,480
Glasses!

401
00:17:12,540 --> 00:17:18,150
Glasses

402
00:17:12,780 --> 00:17:13,910
Ready... and...

403
00:17:16,480 --> 00:17:19,050
You can just grab it!

404
00:17:20,250 --> 00:17:22,620
Okay! Okay! You can switch!

405
00:17:26,790 --> 00:17:28,420
Changed off okay!

406
00:17:27,790 --> 00:17:55,280
Thick-soled boots

407
00:17:28,420 --> 00:17:31,130
Well, the White Group has a huge lead!

408
00:17:31,130 --> 00:17:34,430
White Group is already passed the
net and the Red Group is...?

409
00:17:35,060 --> 00:17:37,600
Red Group, what do you need?

410
00:17:38,200 --> 00:17:42,040
They still seem to be searching for it.

411
00:17:42,040 --> 00:17:43,540
Thick-soled boots!

412
00:17:43,540 --> 00:17:45,410
How's the White Group doing?

413
00:17:45,410 --> 00:17:47,210
They've already taken the bread!

414
00:17:47,210 --> 00:17:49,680
What's taking so long with
that? Please hurry!

415
00:17:50,680 --> 00:17:52,750
What's it? Did you get it?

416
00:17:53,150 --> 00:17:55,520
The thick-soled boots! It's okay!

417
00:17:56,020 --> 00:17:56,920
The second runners!

418
00:17:56,920 --> 00:17:59,120
Ishikawa Rika and Ogawa Makoto!

419
00:17:59,790 --> 00:18:29,080
Scary face

420
00:18:01,660 --> 00:18:03,320
The White Goup's found it perhaps?

421
00:18:05,630 --> 00:18:08,660
Well, what could it possibly be? They
seem to have found something...

422
00:18:10,300 --> 00:18:11,470
What could it be?

423
00:18:11,470 --> 00:18:13,270
A pretty big...

424
00:18:13,270 --> 00:18:16,700
Red Group has caught up!
They're right behind!

425
00:18:16,700 --> 00:18:18,310
Their thing is...

426
00:18:19,470 --> 00:18:22,110
Red Group needs to find their item quickly!

427
00:18:21,510 --> 00:18:35,220
Foreigner

428
00:18:26,950 --> 00:18:28,280
Smile a little...

429
00:18:31,390 --> 00:18:32,820
Okay? Okay?

430
00:18:32,350 --> 00:18:34,620
A foreign person? She's okay!

431
00:18:35,460 --> 00:18:36,890
The foreigner is okay.

432
00:18:39,790 --> 00:18:41,390
Please do it together!

433
00:18:43,560 --> 00:18:45,530
It's the third one!

434
00:18:45,530 --> 00:18:47,230
We're now on the third leg!

435
00:18:47,230 --> 00:18:49,870
Yoshizawa and Niigaki...

436
00:18:49,870 --> 00:18:53,670
Da Pump's Ken and w-inds' Ryohei are now

437
00:18:53,670 --> 00:18:54,840
in the lead!

438
00:18:54,840 --> 00:18:58,280
Both teams are giving it their all!

439
00:18:58,280 --> 00:19:01,310
White Group is almost done!

440
00:19:01,310 --> 00:19:03,350
What's the thing they need?

441
00:19:03,350 --> 00:19:05,420
They've taken the paper and...

442
00:19:05,420 --> 00:19:08,750
The Red Group is closing in!

443
00:19:07,650 --> 00:19:44,460
Crew cut

444
00:19:09,420 --> 00:19:10,920
What could it be?

445
00:19:11,620 --> 00:19:12,690
They're searching for it...

446
00:19:12,690 --> 00:19:15,260
Looking for a person with a crew cut!

447
00:19:15,260 --> 00:19:16,700
And the Red Group?

448
00:19:16,700 --> 00:19:17,930
The Red Group needs...

449
00:19:20,000 --> 00:19:21,170
Might be nobody...

450
00:19:21,370 --> 00:19:37,350
Watch

451
00:19:21,530 --> 00:19:22,670
A watch!?

452
00:19:22,670 --> 00:19:26,040
Red Group is looking for a watch!

453
00:19:26,740 --> 00:19:29,170
A person with a crew cut!

454
00:19:29,170 --> 00:19:30,480
You can't use yourself.

455
00:19:30,480 --> 00:19:32,410
Please look for someone.

456
00:19:32,410 --> 00:19:34,280
And the Red Group?

457
00:19:34,280 --> 00:19:36,480
A watch! A watch!

458
00:19:38,950 --> 00:19:40,850
They can switch to the fourth team!

459
00:19:40,850 --> 00:19:42,150
The fourth team...

460
00:19:42,150 --> 00:19:45,320
Looks like they found their crew cut!

461
00:19:46,390 --> 00:19:48,730
Iida Kaori and Takahashi Ai-chan.

462
00:19:51,330 --> 00:19:53,970
Looks like they did it.

463
00:19:53,970 --> 00:19:56,700
The fourth team for the White Group...

464
00:19:56,700 --> 00:19:59,600
w-inds' Keita and Ryuichi!

465
00:20:01,110 --> 00:20:04,580
Red Group is almost finished.
Young people on both teams!

466
00:20:07,140 --> 00:20:08,880
Keita's got the bread!

467
00:20:08,880 --> 00:20:12,950
They've caught up, the White Group.

468
00:20:12,950 --> 00:20:15,350
From here, we don't know who it could be.

469
00:20:15,490 --> 00:20:42,710
Over 100 kilo person

470
00:20:16,320 --> 00:20:17,790
Aaah~! Crap!

471
00:20:19,560 --> 00:20:21,220
Anybody over 100 kilos!?

472
00:20:20,990 --> 00:20:37,570
Cotton gloves

473
00:20:21,220 --> 00:20:23,130
Cotton gloves! Cotton gloves!

474
00:20:24,330 --> 00:20:26,330
Is there somebody here over 100 kilos?

475
00:20:28,670 --> 00:20:30,900
Found him? Oh the guy from before...

476
00:20:30,900 --> 00:20:34,470
The guy from before with the scary face...

477
00:20:36,670 --> 00:20:37,870
Is this okay?

478
00:20:37,870 --> 00:20:40,510
Cotton gloves!

479
00:20:40,510 --> 00:20:42,010
White Group's cotton gloves are okay.

480
00:20:42,010 --> 00:20:44,910
So this is the last team to go!

481
00:20:44,910 --> 00:20:49,250
The White Group's last team to
go, Matsumoto and DanceMan...

482
00:20:50,450 --> 00:20:54,360
The Red Group's Abe Natsumi and
Konno Asami are catching up...

483
00:20:54,360 --> 00:20:56,530
Abe Natsumi and Konno
Asami are catching up!

484
00:20:56,530 --> 00:20:58,260
They're through the net!

485
00:20:58,260 --> 00:21:01,130
Will DanceMan and Matsumoto
keep the lead?

486
00:21:02,630 --> 00:21:05,330
Konno and Abe have caught up with them...

487
00:21:10,740 --> 00:21:13,640
Konno Asami... and Abe Natsumi
are trying hard...

488
00:21:13,640 --> 00:21:17,180
Both of you guys do your best!

489
00:21:17,180 --> 00:21:19,250
And they're off again!

490
00:21:19,250 --> 00:21:22,380
And now, Matsumoto must search for...

491
00:21:21,480 --> 00:21:45,070
Chest hair person

492
00:21:21,820 --> 00:21:23,650
Someone with chest hair!

493
00:21:24,120 --> 00:21:25,350
Chest hair!?

494
00:21:25,350 --> 00:21:27,290
Anyone with chest hair?

495
00:21:28,390 --> 00:21:31,130
Anybody at all? Anyone with chest hair?

496
00:21:31,890 --> 00:21:34,500
And MoMusu? What must they look for...

497
00:21:35,130 --> 00:21:45,070
2,000 yen bill

498
00:21:35,300 --> 00:21:36,800
2,000 yen bill!

499
00:21:37,430 --> 00:21:40,270
Anybody have one?

500
00:21:41,170 --> 00:21:42,700
Here's the person with chest hair!

501
00:21:42,700 --> 00:21:46,640
Now they need to cross the goal!

502
00:21:46,640 --> 00:21:49,340
Goal! Goal! Please cross the goal line!

503
00:21:50,580 --> 00:21:52,010
The White Group is the winner!

504
00:21:53,950 --> 00:22:01,190
2,000 yen bill

505
00:21:55,750 --> 00:21:59,620
And MoMusu? Did they find someone
with a 2,000 yen bill?

506
00:22:01,150 --> 00:22:04,090
And the Red Group crosses the goal!

507
00:22:09,800 --> 00:22:11,830
Thank you for all your hard work!

508
00:22:12,470 --> 00:22:14,500
You guys did it didn't you!?

509
00:22:13,630 --> 00:22:15,270
I'm so glad!

510
00:22:15,600 --> 00:22:19,210
White Group is the victor!

511
00:22:20,610 --> 00:22:22,110
That guy with the chest hair...

512
00:22:22,110 --> 00:22:23,640
He had a lot didn't he?

513
00:22:24,680 --> 00:22:26,350
There was that guy with the chest hair but

514
00:22:26,350 --> 00:22:28,580
if you look closely, DanceMan's
got tons of it!

515
00:22:29,180 --> 00:22:31,020
You had to use a different person right?

516
00:22:31,020 --> 00:22:34,820
So that means, the looking-for-unappealing-people White Group

517
00:22:34,820 --> 00:22:38,060
has won and receives 100 points!

518
00:22:38,460 --> 00:22:39,460
Thank you!

519
00:22:42,060 --> 00:22:45,560
Battle #3!
Kendo!

520
00:22:52,240 --> 00:22:57,840
So, with the first half of the contest completed,
the White Group has a 100 point lead.

521
00:22:57,840 --> 00:23:00,210
Could this be Red Group's weak point?

522
00:23:01,080 --> 00:23:02,850
This is a challenge between two people.

523
00:23:02,850 --> 00:23:05,550
Same rules as "Strike! Cover!
Jankenpon!" will apply.

524
00:23:05,550 --> 00:23:08,820
The winner of each round gets 50 points!

525
00:23:08,820 --> 00:23:12,660
Well, let's get started with the first people!

526
00:23:12,660 --> 00:23:16,030
The first will be these two people...

527
00:23:16,030 --> 00:23:18,600
From the White Group, Da
Pump's Ken-san and

528
00:23:18,600 --> 00:23:21,500
from the Red Group, Goto Maki-san!

529
00:23:22,230 --> 00:23:24,470
Thank you. Please stand-by.

530
00:23:25,740 --> 00:23:29,110
Matsumoto-san shall preside
over the match.

531
00:23:29,110 --> 00:23:31,010
Even though she's a girl, you've got
to do this with all your strength!

532
00:23:31,010 --> 00:23:33,180
If you don't, then I'll raise the red one!

533
00:23:35,210 --> 00:23:37,750
So, everyone along with
Matsumoto, please...

534
00:23:37,750 --> 00:23:38,920
follow along okay?

535
00:23:39,920 --> 00:23:43,090
So then, this will be the first match-up!

536
00:23:43,090 --> 00:23:45,360
Goto Maki vs Da Pump's Ken!

537
00:23:45,360 --> 00:23:47,260
And now this match... begin!

538
00:23:47,260 --> 00:23:48,090
Ready... and...

539
00:23:48,090 --> 00:23:51,160
"Strike! Cover! Jankenpon!"

540
00:23:51,530 --> 00:23:52,600
Goto Maki!

541
00:23:53,260 --> 00:23:54,500
And he's safe.

542
00:23:58,330 --> 00:24:00,100
You're bad at this aren't you!?

543
00:23:59,570 --> 00:24:01,540
Let's keep going!

544
00:24:03,210 --> 00:24:05,740
When he's safe, you don't
do that with the flags!

545
00:24:06,140 --> 00:24:08,380
If you think about it, I've never
done anything like this...

546
00:24:09,980 --> 00:24:11,780
Last time he should have tried it.

547
00:24:11,780 --> 00:24:12,710
So here we go!

548
00:24:12,710 --> 00:24:13,480
Ready... and...

549
00:24:13,480 --> 00:24:15,950
"Strike! Cover! Jankenpon!"

550
00:24:16,390 --> 00:24:17,420
Goto Maki!

551
00:24:17,420 --> 00:24:19,920
"Strike! Cover! Jankenpon!"

552
00:24:19,920 --> 00:24:21,420
"Looks like a tie!"

553
00:24:21,420 --> 00:24:22,220
Ken!

554
00:24:22,220 --> 00:24:24,030
Ah, he stopped.

555
00:24:27,760 --> 00:24:31,130
Yes and everyone's timings
should be a little better.

556
00:24:30,630 --> 00:24:33,700
You should go at it harder!

557
00:24:33,700 --> 00:24:34,840
All right here we go!

558
00:24:34,840 --> 00:24:37,440
"Strike! Cover! Jankenpon!"

559
00:24:37,440 --> 00:24:41,180
"Looks like a tie!"

560
00:24:48,320 --> 00:24:51,220
"Strike! Cover! Jankenpon!"

561
00:24:51,220 --> 00:24:51,990
Ken!

562
00:24:52,650 --> 00:24:54,560
He seemed a little resigned.

563
00:24:54,920 --> 00:24:57,590
The "bam" is supposed to be like that!

564
00:24:57,990 --> 00:24:59,160
Like that... so go like that.

565
00:24:59,160 --> 00:24:59,860
Like that!

566
00:25:00,360 --> 00:25:01,500
So let's continue!

567
00:25:01,500 --> 00:25:02,330
Let's go!

568
00:25:02,330 --> 00:25:02,960
Ready...

569
00:25:02,960 --> 00:25:05,600
"Strike! Cover! Jankenpon!"

570
00:25:05,600 --> 00:25:06,430
Ken!

571
00:25:06,830 --> 00:25:09,470
"Strike! Cover! Jankenpon!"

572
00:25:09,470 --> 00:25:10,270
Goto!

573
00:25:10,270 --> 00:25:12,640
"Strike! Cover! Jankenpon!"

574
00:25:10,370 --> 00:25:11,270
Close!

575
00:25:12,640 --> 00:25:13,640
Goto!

576
00:25:18,140 --> 00:25:19,680
Goto Maki!

577
00:25:40,430 --> 00:25:43,300
Goto Maki! Goto Maki's the winner!

578
00:25:52,310 --> 00:25:56,250
The second match! From the White
Group, Kawamura Ryuuichi!

579
00:25:56,950 --> 00:25:59,250
And from the Red Group, Yaguchi Mari!

580
00:26:04,290 --> 00:26:05,120
Ready...

581
00:26:05,120 --> 00:26:07,590
"Strike! Cover! Jankenpon!"

582
00:26:07,590 --> 00:26:09,130
"Looks like a tie!"

583
00:26:09,130 --> 00:26:10,030
Kawamura!

584
00:26:10,030 --> 00:26:10,830
Too slow...

585
00:26:10,830 --> 00:26:13,630
"Strike! Cover! Jankenpon!"

586
00:26:13,630 --> 00:26:14,730
Kawamura!

587
00:26:14,730 --> 00:26:17,370
"Strike! Cover! Jankenpon!"

588
00:26:17,370 --> 00:26:18,170
Yaguchi!

589
00:26:18,940 --> 00:26:21,440
"Strike! Cover! Jankenpon!"

590
00:26:21,440 --> 00:26:22,610
"Looks like a tie!"

591
00:26:22,610 --> 00:26:23,140
Yaguchi!

592
00:26:23,140 --> 00:26:24,140
Ah! Sorry!

593
00:26:24,140 --> 00:26:26,810
"Strike! Cover! Jankenpon!"

594
00:26:26,810 --> 00:26:27,680
Yaguchi again!

595
00:26:28,180 --> 00:26:30,580
"Strike! Cover! Jankenpon!"

596
00:26:30,580 --> 00:26:31,450
Yaguchi!

597
00:26:31,980 --> 00:26:34,320
"Strike! Cover! Jankenpon!"

598
00:26:34,320 --> 00:26:34,950
Kawa!

599
00:26:36,420 --> 00:26:39,490
"Strike! Cover! Jankenpon!"

600
00:26:39,490 --> 00:26:40,390
Kawamura!

601
00:26:40,390 --> 00:26:41,460
Pretty good.

602
00:26:43,460 --> 00:26:44,330
Kawamura!

603
00:26:44,330 --> 00:26:45,430
What about now?

604
00:26:52,440 --> 00:26:54,270
So who was it just now?

605
00:26:53,840 --> 00:26:56,140
No, no, no... I wasn't watching.

606
00:26:57,410 --> 00:27:00,380
"Strike! Cover! Jankenpon!"

607
00:27:00,380 --> 00:27:01,310
Kawamura!

608
00:27:01,310 --> 00:27:02,850
"Jankenpon!"

609
00:27:02,850 --> 00:27:04,180
"Looks like a tie!"

610
00:27:04,580 --> 00:27:05,450
Yaguchi!

611
00:27:05,450 --> 00:27:06,750
"Jankenpon!"

612
00:27:07,150 --> 00:27:07,920
Yaguchi!

613
00:27:07,920 --> 00:27:09,220
"Jankenpon!"

614
00:27:09,220 --> 00:27:10,090
Kawamura!

615
00:27:10,090 --> 00:27:10,920
And now?

616
00:27:12,020 --> 00:27:15,960
The white flag! Kawamura Ryuuichi!

617
00:27:43,820 --> 00:27:47,590
Kawamura-san, you were pretty
easy on her weren't you?

618
00:27:47,590 --> 00:27:49,860
Like... how do you say...

619
00:27:49,860 --> 00:27:51,860
I have a gentle life towards girls!

620
00:27:55,530 --> 00:27:58,700
Hamada obviously thinks differently.

621
00:27:59,630 --> 00:28:00,470
DanceMan!

622
00:28:01,170 --> 00:28:02,640
"Jankenpon!"

623
00:28:02,640 --> 00:28:03,640
"Looks like a tie!"

624
00:28:03,640 --> 00:28:07,810
After the commercial, the occurrence of a
