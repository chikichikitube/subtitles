1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,780
Yamasaki Hosei

2
00:00:01,600 --> 00:00:03,750
North Sea crusher Moriman

3
00:00:04,400 --> 00:00:11,500
The two have never ever been so stubborn before, facing and fighting each other again and again, however it all ended up as failures to Yamasaki

4
00:00:11,500 --> 00:00:13,300
His pants were taken off

5
00:00:13,600 --> 00:00:15,200
And was brutally beaten

6
00:00:15,800 --> 00:00:24,300
After that, this summer a battle was held, where Yamazasaki lost all rounds in front of everyone's eyes

7
00:00:25,200 --> 00:00:30,600
In front of Moriman's astonishing power, you get to know what real life is

8
00:00:31,100 --> 00:00:34,300
In the end, Yamasaki ran away from the ring

9
00:00:35,200 --> 00:00:40,600
He said, that next year this match can be continued

10
00:00:43,400 --> 00:00:47,600
"The biggest winter campaign of the century"
Yamazaki vs Moriman Storming Last Final Revenge Match

11
00:00:50,000 --> 00:00:53,300
Yamasaki enters the venue three hours before the decisive battle

12
00:00:54,600 --> 00:00:57,400
Then 30 minutes later, arrives Moriman

13
00:00:57,600 --> 00:01:01,000
The venue before the decisive battle of the century was quiet

14
00:01:01,600 --> 00:01:03,000
"Pre-match doctor check"

15
00:01:04,500 --> 00:01:05,000
Yamasaki san

16
00:01:06,500 --> 00:01:07,700
What's the matter?

17
00:01:08,600 --> 00:01:10,200
Is your physical condition alright today?

18
00:01:10,200 --> 00:01:10,970
It's fine

19
00:01:10,970 --> 00:01:14,000
You don't need to be afraid having a body check

20
00:01:14,300 --> 00:01:16,000
There's no need in that

21
00:01:16,000 --> 00:01:18,700
Your zip's undone already

22
00:01:19,600 --> 00:01:20,700
Is that fine? Then please...

23
00:01:21,500 --> 00:01:22,700
Take that off

24
00:01:22,700 --> 00:01:25,400
Everyone does that before fighting

25
00:01:25,600 --> 00:01:27,400
Just check my heartbeat

26
00:01:29,000 --> 00:01:31,900
Look how his arms are hanging

27
00:01:31,900 --> 00:01:38,300
How raised it. You took your clothes off, as if you'll have a heart attack

28
00:01:39,000 --> 00:01:40,300
Like he's going to die

29
00:01:42,000 --> 00:01:43,800
His heart beats a little too fast

30
00:01:43,800 --> 00:01:44,900
So he's worrying

31
00:01:44,900 --> 00:01:46,900
Let's listen to him breathing

32
00:01:51,200 --> 00:01:55,800
His breathing is fine. So it's alright. He just feels very nervous

33
00:01:55,800 --> 00:01:57,100
He's nervous?

34
00:01:58,200 --> 00:02:00,900
That's not true. I am going to do it!

35
00:02:00,900 --> 00:02:01,400
Really?

36
00:02:01,800 --> 00:02:03,000
Really?

37
00:02:04,000 --> 00:02:07,300
Doctor and Yamazaki san have been through some stuff

38
00:02:22,000 --> 00:02:27,400
The day of the match is finally here, where in the Korakuen Hall a history will be made

39
00:02:27,400 --> 00:02:29,200
More and more people gather at the venue

40
00:02:30,800 --> 00:02:34,400
And finally the venue is completely filled, with the audience being electrified

41
00:02:34,700 --> 00:02:36,400
All that is left is to wait for the match

42
00:02:37,100 --> 00:02:39,890
Why don't we have a look at how both fighters are doing now

43
00:02:39,890 --> 00:02:42,600
How are they doin... Ah, here we have two assistants

44
00:02:42,600 --> 00:02:44,300
Thanks for having us

45
00:02:44,300 --> 00:02:45,400
I think he'll make it today

46
00:02:47,200 --> 00:02:49,200
He looks good today

47
00:02:49,200 --> 00:02:51,200
So he'll do it today? He will.

48
00:02:51,200 --> 00:02:54,200
I really want him to do his best

49
00:02:55,000 --> 00:02:56,800
That's a waiting room?

50
00:02:57,600 --> 00:03:00,000
So, that's Moriman?

51
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:02,000
She looks so relaxed

52
00:03:02,000 --> 00:03:03,400
She looks like she's at resort

53
00:03:04,200 --> 00:03:08,100
And her partner is.. No way that's real

54
00:03:08,700 --> 00:03:10,900
They act as they will never lose

55
00:03:11,500 --> 00:03:15,700
They seem just like last match, that they have plenty of free time

56
00:03:15,900 --> 00:03:17,200
And Yamasaki san is here

57
00:03:18,000 --> 00:03:20,100
That looks weird. YOU, LISTEN HERE!!

58
00:03:20,100 --> 00:03:23,200
I WILL ASK IT AGAIN! DID SOMEBODY SAID THAT I'LL LOSE?

59
00:03:23,500 --> 00:03:26,000
So he beat them up? THAT'S HOW YOU END UP!!!

60
00:03:27,000 --> 00:03:28,900
I didn't know this side of him before

61
00:03:28,900 --> 00:03:34,300
Moriman is scary! Do it genis cumedean. Do it with your right hand!

62
00:03:34,300 --> 00:03:36,400
What's that, genis cumedean?

63
00:03:36,400 --> 00:03:38,000
No idea

64
00:03:38,000 --> 00:03:41,100
Ah, do it genius comedian

65
00:03:42,000 --> 00:03:47,000
When he kicks, it's difficult to hear

66
00:03:47,000 --> 00:03:49,500
Right hand, right. Will he say that again?

67
00:03:49,500 --> 00:03:50,800
Go for it, genis cumedean!

68
00:03:52,600 --> 00:03:54,500
Now at least we got it

69
00:03:54,500 --> 00:03:55,600
Moriman is scary!

70
00:03:56,200 --> 00:03:57,400
Moriman is scary

71
00:03:59,200 --> 00:04:02,000
He presses him with "Moriman is scary"

72
00:04:02,400 --> 00:04:03,200
Will he say it again?

73
00:04:04,000 --> 00:04:04,800
Moriman is scary!

74
00:04:10,000 --> 00:04:11,600
That was hilarious

75
00:04:29,000 --> 00:04:30,900
Thank you for your wait!

76
00:04:31,900 --> 00:04:35,700
The biggest fight of the year is about to begin

77
00:04:38,200 --> 00:04:40,300
Yamasaki vs Moriman

78
00:04:40,300 --> 00:04:43,900
Storming Last Final Revenge Match

79
00:04:51,000 --> 00:04:56,000
First of all, this competition's jury, Downtown's entrance

80
00:05:19,500 --> 00:05:20,600
Thank you very much!

81
00:05:23,400 --> 00:05:25,500
Is it really the final match?

82
00:05:25,500 --> 00:05:30,800
I would also hope to think so, but he always keeps dragging that further, so that can't be helped

83
00:05:32,000 --> 00:05:34,400
What if Yamasaki will suddenly lose today?

84
00:05:37,800 --> 00:05:41,300
Yamasaki should definitely make it

85
00:05:41,300 --> 00:05:44,300
He honestly should do win it

86
00:05:44,500 --> 00:05:47,900
I think he worked enough for that

87
00:05:47,900 --> 00:05:50,800
Today I the most important thing is to have an intention to do it

88
00:05:50,800 --> 00:05:57,000
And finally, ladies and gentlemen, I think everyone wants to see him win

89
00:05:59,000 --> 00:06:01,600
Ladies and gentlemen, I ask for our attention

90
00:06:01,600 --> 00:06:04,300
Champion Moriman's entrance!

91
00:06:37,500 --> 00:06:41,300
There's even a banner, saying "North Sea crusher Moriman"

92
00:06:42,000 --> 00:06:44,400
You came all the way from Hokkaido

93
00:06:44,700 --> 00:06:50,900
Moriman had to come to Tokyo, all the way from there

94
00:06:50,900 --> 00:06:53,600
That was honestly so bothersome to come here

95
00:06:55,000 --> 00:06:58,000
Today I will absolutely destroy him

96
00:07:00,000 --> 00:07:03,200
Shall we greet our next challenger?

97
00:07:03,600 --> 00:07:07,400
And our next challenger - Yamasaki Hosei's entrance!

98
00:07:26,500 --> 00:07:29,600
I DON'T WANT TO BE A LOOSER ANYMORE!

99
00:08:00,400 --> 00:08:02,400
HOLD IT! WAIT!

100
00:08:06,000 --> 00:08:08,700
I'M SICK OF THIS BORING-ASS PERFORMANCE! SHUT UP!

101

THAT'S MY DANCE OF DETERMINATION!!!

102
00:08:11,400 --> 00:08:13,300
I DON'T GET THAT CRAP!

103
00:08:14,000 --> 00:08:16,500
I HAD TO COME ALL THE WAY FROM HOKKAIDO HERE!

104
00:08:19,000 --> 00:08:24,300
FROM THE BEGINNING, A MAN REACHES OUT TO HIS DREAM!

105
00:08:28,800 --> 00:08:30,200
The hell did you say?

106
00:08:32,500 --> 00:08:42,200
TODAY, RIGHT HERE, IN THE YEAR 1998, YOU'LL SEE YOUR DEFEAT!!!

00:08:49,000 --> 00:08:51,000
FINE,LET'S FIGHT!

111
00:08:54,000 --> 00:08:55,600
Let's give him a final word

112
00:08:55,600 --> 00:08:57,700
Yes. FROM THE BEGIN...

113
00:08:57,700 --> 00:08:58,300
Cut that off

114
00:09:02,000 --> 00:09:10,100
Now ladies and gentlemen, we will proceed to Yamasaki's friends flower ceremony

115
00:09:12,000 --> 00:09:18,200
The first person to come is Yamasaki san's old pal

Following up, flowers from NSC (Yoshimoto New Star Creation) Morishita Yukio sama

Ladies and gentlemen, please look over there

133
00:10:56,500 --> 00:10:57,700
Is he a fool?

134
00:11:15,000 --> 00:11:16,700
He's so irritating

135
00:11:19,000 --> 00:11:22,700
Childcare in Japan is number one

136
00:11:23,500 --> 00:11:26,500
You're all doing great today!

137
00:11:42,500 --> 00:11:43,900
Thank you very much

138
00:11:44,800 --> 00:11:49,100
Let's give now a word to Downtown

139
00:11:49,600 --> 00:11:52,200
Please ladies and gentlemen remain quiet

140
00:11:52,800 --> 00:11:55,000
Well, our dear audience, now will have

00:11:55,500 --> 00:11:57,700
Heipo's performance

00:12:09,200 --> 00:12:10,900
Let's commence

143
00:12:32,300 --> 00:12:34,800
I didn't really know what to expect from that

144
00:12:35,000 --> 00:12:36,800
But that went OK

145
00:12:36,800 --> 00:12:39,900
So, let's see now the battle menu

146
00:12:40,700 --> 00:12:41,700
Over there!

147
00:12:47,000 --> 00:12:54,300
From now on, fighting styles for our fighters will be chosen from this board

148
00:12:54,300 --> 00:12:57,900
Well, I think for the first round will shall choose something that we haven't used before

149
00:12:57,900 --> 00:13:00,600
Pantyhose removal duel

150
00:13:00,600 --> 00:13:03,000
So this one? It'll be terrible

151
00:13:03,000 --> 00:13:05,500
You think so? I think it will go well

152
00:13:06,000 --> 00:13:07,100
Is that alright with you? Yes!

153
00:13:07,100 --> 00:13:07,700
Sound good!

154
00:13:08,500 --> 00:13:12,100

00:13:21,500 --> 00:13:22,200
First round!

158
00:13:25,000 --> 00:13:25,900
Here it comes!

159
00:13:30,000 --> 00:13:32,400
The movements are not that bad

160
00:13:33,100 --> 00:13:35,900
I think we can give them one extra minute

161
00:13:40,000 --> 00:13:41,400
He's losing it

162
00:13:51,400 --> 00:13:53,100

00:13:57,700 --> 00:13:58,500
Please, listen for a moment

166
00:13:58,500 --> 00:13:59,000
OK

167
00:13:59,000 --> 00:14:00,500
It became too intense

168
00:14:01,500 --> 00:14:03,200
How can you say such words?

169
00:14:03,700 --> 00:14:05,200
No, I'm serious, serious

170
00:14:05,400 --> 00:14:07,200
Aren't you alright?

171
00:14:07,200 --> 00:14:07,800

Did you hear that?

178
00:14:32,000 --> 00:14:32,800
I did very well

179
00:14:34,000 --> 00:14:35,500
Can Moriman hear?

180
00:14:37,800 --> 00:14:38,900
Can you hear?

181
00:14:48,300 --> 00:14:50,800
Moriman can you hear? it's alright

182
00:14:57,000 --> 00:14:58,100
Go, go for it!

183
00:14:58,600 --> 00:15:00,000
Go for it!

184
00:15:07,000 --> 00:15:08,800
Can you hear? Can you hear us?

185
00:15:10,000 --> 00:15:10,800
Can you hear?

186
00:15:43,400 --> 00:15:44,600
Yamasaki san

187
00:15:45,500 --> 00:15:46,600
You're OUT!

188
00:15:47,100 --> 00:15:48,600
As soon as it flew from the ring

189
00:15:50,600 --> 00:15:51,900
I was so close!

190
00:15:51,900 --> 00:15:54,900
That was such an exciting battle!

191
00:15:55,400 --> 00:15:57,300
Yamasaki san, tell us your next fighting style

192
00:15:57,700 --> 00:16:00,600
LONG TROUSERS SHOWDOWN!!!!

193
00:16:01,300 --> 00:16:03,800
That's a new style

194
00:16:04,300 --> 00:16:05,800
What a foolish match style

195
00:16:06,300 --> 00:16:07,800
The hell's that?

196
00:16:12,000 --> 00:16:16,100
Go for it, genis cumedean! Moriman is scary!

197
00:16:16,100 --> 00:16:18,600
They gave him some advises

198
00:16:18,600 --> 00:16:21,700
I think they are the most incomprehensible foreigners

199
00:16:22,300 --> 00:16:25,900
"Long trousers showdown"

200
00:16:30,200 --> 00:16:32,800
That's quite a...

201
00:16:33,600 --> 00:16:36,300
I think no one ever saw a fight like that

202
00:16:36,300 --> 00:16:37,500
Do your best!

203
00:16:40,800 --> 00:16:42,600
The way he hit his head

204
00:16:42,600 --> 00:16:43,600
He can't lose like that

205
00:16:49,000 --> 00:16:49,700
Yamasaki

206
00:16:50,100 --> 00:16:51,700
He's being knocked down

207
00:16:53,000 --> 00:16:53,700
He's knocked down

208
00:17:00,700 --> 00:17:04,600
That was so wrong. Why were you hitting an arm like this?

209
00:17:04,600 --> 00:17:05,300
Do you want to quit?

210
00:17:05,300 --> 00:17:07,400
No, you're wrong

211
00:17:07,400 --> 00:17:08,000
What's that?

212
00:17:08,000 --> 00:17:09,200
That's so I could go

213
00:17:11,200 --> 00:17:15,000
We were so surprised, we thought that you wanted to give up

214
00:17:23,400 --> 00:17:24,600
He's knocked again

215
00:17:25,100 --> 00:17:26,000
He's knocked

216
00:17:30,000 --> 00:17:30,900
Yamasaki san!

217
00:17:31,500 --> 00:17:32,900
Stop doing like that!

218
00:17:36,000 --> 00:17:38,500
No, no, that looks like a joke. Please put more effort

219
00:17:38,500 --> 00:17:40,800
That's a give up gesture

220
00:17:42,300 --> 00:17:43,900
I'm doing that when I'm desperate

221
00:17:47,500 --> 00:17:48,900
THE NEXT MATCH!!!

222
00:17:53,900 --> 00:17:58,600
Well, what do you think about Gobourebaki stick match?

223
00:18:01,000 --> 00:18:02,800
Gobou stick showdown

224
00:18:03,500 --> 00:18:10,300
Gobou stick showdown, that will be a brawl for real fighters

225
00:18:10,300 --> 00:18:14,400
So that will be, indeed, a sight. Matsumoto san, please look over there

226
00:18:14,400 --> 00:18:17,300
They look like his real mentors

227
00:18:17,300 --> 00:18:20,900
I WILL DO IT!!!

228
00:18:22,000 --> 00:18:22,900
BRING THAT ON!!!

229
00:18:23,500 --> 00:18:24,400
WE UNDERSTAND!!!

230
00:18:26,400 --> 00:18:29,800
"Gobou stick showdown"

231
00:18:42,500 --> 00:18:43,800
Yamasaki san!

232
00:18:43,800 --> 00:18:49,800
It hurts, it really hurts! It hurts?

233
00:18:51,000 --> 00:18:58,300
Please, listen! That's no good, fighting with these sticks.

234
00:18:58,300 --> 00:19:00,100
Do you mean that you want thicker sticks?

235
00:19:01,300 --> 00:19:02,100
No way!

236
00:19:12,100 --> 00:19:14,000
How foolish

237
00:19:14,700 --> 00:19:15,400
Yamasaki san!

238
00:19:15,600 --> 00:19:18,700
Is this match going to finish with Yamasaki's defeat?

239
00:19:18,700 --> 00:19:20,600
That hurt, that really hurt

240
00:19:45,800 --> 00:19:47,000
Yamasaki san

241
00:19:47,300 --> 00:19:48,300
Gobou stick match

242
00:19:48,900 --> 00:19:50,300
LET'S GET IT ON!!

243
00:19:54,500 --> 00:19:55,200
Let's start!

244
00:20:16,200 --> 00:20:18,600
He fought so wrong

245
00:20:21,000 --> 00:20:23,500
That was such a big mistake

246
00:20:25,500 --> 00:20:26,200
Yamasaki san

247
00:20:27,800 --> 00:20:30,000
He gave us a spectacular reaction

248
00:20:33,200 --> 00:20:35,500
We stay with the Gobou stick fight

249
00:20:58,000 --> 00:21:00,300
Yamasaki san, are fine losing it this way?

250
00:21:00,800 --> 00:21:02,300
I lost!

251
00:21:07,500 --> 00:21:12,700
Yamasaki san, you may have lost this round, but next one you'll surely win

252
00:21:13,200 --> 00:21:14,700
That's what you should tell

253
00:21:18,500 --> 00:21:20,400
I really hate it

254
00:21:21,200 --> 00:21:23,500
If that's so, then let's go with another style

255
00:21:23,500 --> 00:21:25,500
Piping hot soup

256
00:21:28,500 --> 00:21:29,400
That must be good

257
00:21:30,000 --> 00:21:33,300
"Piping hot soup showdown"

258
00:21:33,700 --> 00:21:38,400
That looks really hot

259
00:22:07,000 --> 00:22:07,800
Matsumoto san

260
00:22:08,600 --> 00:22:10,600
I think after that he'll become a disabled person

261
00:22:13,600 --> 00:22:20,800
You know, it seems like it's impossible for Moriman to lose even once

262
00:22:23,000 --> 00:22:26,200
Next match you will absolutely win

263
00:22:27,000 --> 00:22:28,700
Please give me a real match

264
00:22:31,200 --> 00:22:35,300
From what we saw before, you don't seem that you really want to win

265
00:22:35,300 --> 00:22:39,200
Understood. Next match will be a K-1

266
00:22:40,500 --> 00:22:42,400
K-1 SHOWDOWN!

267
00:22:43,400 --> 00:22:47,000
"K-1 showdown"

268
00:22:47,400 --> 00:22:51,900
This time, referee will be Hamada san

269
00:22:56,000 --> 00:22:56,800
Please

270
00:22:57,500 --> 00:22:58,800
We count on you!

271
00:22:59,700 --> 00:23:00,800
Let's start!

272
00:24:04,500 --> 00:24:08,900
This is the first time Moriman fell from Yamasaki! Will we remember this fight as his first victory?

273
00:24:08,900 --> 00:24:11,700
Try to guess, until you'll find it out next week!
