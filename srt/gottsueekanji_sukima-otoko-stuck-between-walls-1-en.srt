00:00:08,040 --> 00:00:09,100
Ok, lets go

3
00:00:09,570 --> 00:00:11,100
Did you shut the window? Oh, it's shut

4
00:00:12,670 --> 00:00:13,070
What?

5
00:00:15,240 --> 00:00:16,100
What are you doing?

6
00:00:17,040 --> 00:00:18,040
What are YOU doing?

7
00:00:18,100 --> 00:00:19,200
I'm stuck

8
00:00:19,400 --> 00:00:19,970
Oh, really?

9
00:00:20,240 --> 00:00:21,200
Yes, I am

10
00:00:21,370 --> 00:00:22,340
Are you ok?

11
00:00:22,470 --> 00:00:23,470
I'm fine

12
00:00:24,100 --> 00:00:24,600
Can you get out?

13
00:00:24,600 --> 00:00:25,600
Of course I can, idiot!

14
00:00:25,600 --> 00:00:26,670
If you can, then get out

15
00:00:26,770 --> 00:00:27,870
I'm not feeling well

16
00:00:27,870 --> 00:00:28,700
You feeling sick?

17
00:00:28,800 --> 00:00:29,900
I was eating Okaiyu

18
00:00:30,670 --> 00:00:31,140
Rice porridge?

19
00:00:32,540 --> 00:00:33,340
Where we're you eating Okaiyu?

20
00:00:33,300 --> 00:00:34,740
I ate it in the back

21
00:00:34,740 --> 00:00:36,740
Don't lie! What are you doing?

22
00:00:36,740 --> 00:00:37,570
I'm stuck in here!

23
00:00:37,840 --> 00:00:38,570
Stuck?

24
00:00:39,500 --> 00:00:41,200
You can get out by yourself, right?

25
00:00:41,200 --> 00:00:42,140
Yes I can

26
00:00:42,140 --> 00:00:43,100
If you can, then do it!

27
00:00:43,100 --> 00:00:44,300
I can't do that

28
00:00:44,870 --> 00:00:46,040
What are you saying, old man?

29
00:00:45,900 --> 00:00:46,840
My legs are rotten

30
00:00:48,000 --> 00:00:48,600
You ok?

31
00:00:48,600 --> 00:00:49,040
Yeah

32
00:00:49,770 --> 00:00:51,040
Are they really rotten?
- Yeah

33
00:00:51,040 --> 00:00:51,770
Shall I call an ambulance?

34
00:00:51,800 --> 00:00:53,140
I don't need an ambulance

35
00:00:53,270 --> 00:00:54,400
If you can get out, then get out!

36
00:00:54,540 --> 00:00:56,100
Shut up, I already told you, stupid!

37
00:00:56,440 --> 00:00:57,300
Who you calling stupid?

38
00:00:57,970 --> 00:00:59,000
I'm going to beat you up, old man!

39
00:01:02,200 --> 00:01:03,040
Hurry and get out!

40
00:01:03,040 --> 00:01:04,340
I said I'm stuck!

41
00:01:05,040 --> 00:01:06,200
Kurimoto-san!
- Yeah

42
00:01:06,270 --> 00:01:07,800
Kurimoto-san?
- Yes, yes?

43
00:01:07,900 --> 00:01:08,940
Kurimoto-san!

44
00:01:07,900 --> 00:01:09,740
Yes?

45
00:01:08,940 --> 00:01:09,740
Excuse me!

46
00:01:10,200 --> 00:01:12,240
There's this strange old man here

47
00:01:12,240 --> 00:01:13,300
Hey, what are you doing?

48
00:01:13,300 --> 00:01:14,400
I'm stuck!

49
00:01:15,500 --> 00:01:16,770
You have to get out!

50
00:01:16,770 --> 00:01:18,440
Don't touch me, my legs are rotten

51
00:01:19,070 --> 00:01:20,440
He's stuck?

52
00:01:21,200 --> 00:01:22,440
You should get out, old man

53
00:01:22,440 --> 00:01:23,440
I want to, idiot

54
00:01:23,440 --> 00:01:24,800
You're being a nuisance, right?

55
00:01:24,800 --> 00:01:25,970
My kid is taking his exam soon

56
00:01:27,200 --> 00:01:29,100
My kid is in an entrance exam war!

57
00:01:30,940 --> 00:01:32,000
So, why are you here?

58
00:01:32,000 --> 00:01:33,000
I'm praying!

59
00:01:34,700 --> 00:01:37,300
Why do that here? Go to a shrine!

60
00:01:37,300 --> 00:01:39,640
Of course, I want to go to a shrine!

61
00:01:40,740 --> 00:01:42,570
If you get out, I'll show you where the shrine is!

62
00:01:42,570 --> 00:01:44,070
I told you I'm stuck and can't come out!

63
00:01:44,070 --> 00:01:46,800
Maybe we should call the police
- Can you go and get the police?

64
00:01:46,800 --> 00:01:47,570
Yes!

65
00:01:47,570 --> 00:01:48,000
What?

66
00:01:48,400 --> 00:01:50,570
We called the police just now

67
00:01:50,570 --> 00:01:51,740
Police?
- Yeah, the police

68
00:01:51,840 --> 00:01:53,340
Ok, that's fine

69
00:01:53,340 --> 00:01:54,900
If you can get out, get out now!

70
00:01:54,900 --> 00:01:56,170
I can't get out

71
00:01:56,470 --> 00:01:57,270
Oh, thank you for coming

72
00:01:58,700 --> 00:01:59,940
Can't you get out by yourself?

73
00:01:59,940 --> 00:02:00,570
I can

74
00:02:00,700 --> 00:02:01,600
Then why don't you come out?

75
00:02:01,600 --> 00:02:02,900
Because my legs are rotten

76
00:02:03,070 --> 00:02:05,970
Well, if your legs are rotten, I can take you to the hospital

77
00:02:05,970 --> 00:02:08,470
I can't get out, but I want to get out

78
00:02:09,070 --> 00:02:12,070
Hey old man, if you are stuck there, you can't do anything

79
00:02:12,070 --> 00:02:13,070
Ok, how's this?

80
00:02:13,070 --> 00:02:13,500
What?

81
00:02:14,000 --> 00:02:14,640
We'll give you some money

82
00:02:15,170 --> 00:02:16,740
Money? I want money!

83
00:02:16,740 --> 00:02:17,400
Ok, we'll give you money

84
00:02:17,400 --> 00:02:18,800
I'll take as much as you give me!

85
00:02:19,670 --> 00:02:20,070
Right?

86
00:02:20,440 --> 00:02:21,500
If you get out, I'll give it to you

87
00:02:21,700 --> 00:02:23,040
Really? How much?

88
00:02:23,200 --> 00:02:23,800
100 yen

89
00:02:24,000 --> 00:02:24,940
100 yen?
- Yeah

90
00:02:25,170 --> 00:02:26,540
100 yen huh?
- Yeah

91
00:02:27,300 --> 00:02:27,940
That much?

92
00:02:29,670 --> 00:02:31,500
Yes 100 yen
- 100 yen, how many times?

93
00:02:31,600 --> 00:02:32,140
One

94
00:02:32,770 --> 00:02:34,370
100 yen, I guess that's pretty good, huh

95
00:02:35,700 --> 00:02:36,400
Give me 300

96
00:02:36,740 --> 00:02:38,400
Ok, if you get out, I'll give you 300

97
00:02:38,400 --> 00:02:39,300
You can give me that much?

98
00:02:41,000 --> 00:02:41,570
300...

99
00:02:42,200 --> 00:02:42,900
How much?

100
00:02:43,100 --> 00:02:44,970
I'll give you, 100 yen x 3

101
00:02:44,970 --> 00:02:46,170
300?
- Ok

102
00:02:46,170 --> 00:02:47,040
Ok get out

103
00:02:58,740 --> 00:02:59,900
He had a knife!

104
00:02:59,900 --> 00:03:01,400
You were swinging your knife around

105
00:03:01,540 --> 00:03:02,040
Yeah

106
00:03:02,040 --> 00:03:03,470
Why are you carrying a knife like that?

107
00:03:03,470 --> 00:03:04,640
I felt I was in danger

108
00:03:04,640 --> 00:03:06,340
We're the ones feeling danger

109
00:03:07,340 --> 00:03:09,200
That's not good
- Why?

110
00:03:09,240 --> 00:03:10,270
Old man
- Yeah

111
00:03:10,370 --> 00:03:13,800
Old man you must be hungry, right?

112
00:03:13,800 --> 00:03:14,900
Yeah, I'm starving

113
00:03:15,000 --> 00:03:16,870
I have some Castella in my apartment

114
00:03:16,870 --> 00:03:17,700
Wow, Castella

115
00:03:17,700 --> 00:03:19,140
Let's go eat
- I love Castella

116
00:03:20,140 --> 00:03:21,970
If you get out, I'll give you lots of Castella

117
00:03:30,100 --> 00:03:30,540
Hey!

118
00:03:31,670 --> 00:03:32,140
Old man!

119
00:03:33,700 --> 00:03:35,040
You shouldn't swing your knife

120
00:03:35,970 --> 00:03:37,300
Throw down your knife

121
00:03:37,300 --> 00:03:37,800
Why?

122
00:03:38,800 --> 00:03:40,040
Old man
- Yeah

123
00:03:40,300 --> 00:03:42,040
You were thinking to rob one of these houses, right?

124
00:03:42,300 --> 00:03:44,700
Then you hid in there, and couldn't get out, right?

125
00:03:44,700 --> 00:03:48,900
I was thinking to rob a house and got stuck in here, yes!

126
00:03:50,640 --> 00:03:51,800
That's premeditated

127
00:03:52,170 --> 00:03:53,570
Ok? That's a crime

128
00:03:53,870 --> 00:03:54,600
Crime?

129
00:03:54,700 --> 00:03:55,570
I will arrest you

130
00:03:56,100 --> 00:03:56,970
My kids will cry

131
00:03:57,270 --> 00:03:58,770
Yes, they will

132
00:03:58,770 --> 00:04:00,140
My kids will cry...
- Yes

133
00:04:00,300 --> 00:04:01,070
I'll also cry

134
00:04:01,770 --> 00:04:02,700
I'll cry too

135
00:04:05,200 --> 00:04:06,370
Why you smiling like that?

136
00:04:08,840 --> 00:04:10,370
Take this seriously
- Yeah

137
00:04:10,370 --> 00:04:13,600
Like right now, think, I will always try my best...

138
00:04:13,600 --> 00:04:15,140
not to get into prison

139
00:04:15,140 --> 00:04:17,670
You won't try to take me to prison
- I wont

140
00:04:17,670 --> 00:04:19,340
You can trust me
- Really?

141
00:04:19,400 --> 00:04:21,170
Anyway, throw down the knife
- Throuw down the knife

142
00:04:21,270 --> 00:04:22,900
Come out, quietly
- Come out quietly

143
00:04:23,370 --> 00:04:26,000
You can't do anything if you stay in there right?

144
00:04:26,100 --> 00:04:26,600
Yeah

145
00:04:27,140 --> 00:04:28,600
Ok, just come out, ok?

146
00:04:28,600 --> 00:04:29,600
Get a job

147
00:04:30,000 --> 00:04:31,040
I'll get a job

148
00:04:31,200 --> 00:04:31,670
That's right

149
00:04:31,940 --> 00:04:32,540
You must work

150
00:04:32,540 --> 00:04:34,940
I should work
- Yes you should work

151
00:04:35,540 --> 00:04:36,940
Ok?
- You speak well

152
00:04:38,640 --> 00:04:39,100
What?

153
00:04:39,740 --> 00:04:40,800
Are you a professional speaker?

154
00:04:42,500 --> 00:04:43,300
I'm a policeman

155
00:04:43,440 --> 00:04:45,200
Ok? I'm just a regular person

156
00:04:45,400 --> 00:04:47,370
Ok? I'm telling you the truth

157
00:04:47,840 --> 00:04:49,000
Ok, throw down the knife and come out

158
00:04:49,240 --> 00:04:51,000
Will you arrest me if I do it?

159
00:04:51,000 --> 00:04:53,600
No, I just want to question you, then you can go

160
00:04:55,240 --> 00:04:57,070
Really?
- Really, I wouldn't lie

161
00:05:01,000 --> 00:05:02,400
Old man
- What?

162
00:05:03,840 --> 00:05:05,200
Did you understand what I said?

163
00:05:05,500 --> 00:05:06,800
I did
- Then get out from there

164
00:05:07,800 --> 00:05:09,140
So you want me to come out, right?

165
00:05:09,140 --> 00:05:10,940
Yes, if you come out, everything will be fine

166
00:05:10,940 --> 00:05:11,670
You're sure right?

167
00:05:12,240 --> 00:05:13,400
You're sure right?
- Yes, yes

168
00:05:19,300 --> 00:05:20,470
Throw down the knife!

169
00:05:20,470 --> 00:05:21,970
Ouch ouch ouch ouch!

170
00:05:24,940 --> 00:05:26,200
Hey hey hey hey!

171
00:05:27,970 --> 00:05:28,740
Get out already

172
00:05:29,970 --> 00:05:31,100
How can we finish this?

173
00:05:32,670 --> 00:05:33,700
It's up to you

174
00:05:36,300 --> 00:05:37,600
Ok... I'm coming out

175
00:05:39,300 --> 00:05:40,600
Come out with a good attitude

176
00:05:41,800 --> 00:05:43,100
Well, I don't have my knife

177
00:05:43,940 --> 00:05:45,900
I guess I can't make them laugh either

178
00:05:48,400 --> 00:05:49,600
Higashino
- Yeah

179
00:05:49,670 --> 00:05:50,870
Wanna do this again next week?
