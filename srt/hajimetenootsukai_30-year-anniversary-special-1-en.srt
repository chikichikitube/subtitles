00:00:04,980 --> 00:00:10,160
Hilarious! 30 year anniversary special.

3
00:00:10,160 --> 00:00:13,060
We've been waiting for this.

4
00:00:13,060 --> 00:00:14,930
This is "Your First Errand".

5
00:00:14,930 --> 00:00:17,830
Happy new year.

6
00:00:16,130 --> 00:00:17,830
George Tokoro

7
00:00:16,130 --> 00:00:17,830
Moriguchi Hiroko

8
00:00:17,830 --> 00:00:19,500
Amami Yuuki

9
00:00:17,830 --> 00:00:19,500
Football hour:

10
00:00:17,830 --> 00:00:19,500
Gotou Terumoto

11
00:00:19,500 --> 00:00:20,670
Mister Tokoro...

12
00:00:19,500 --> 00:00:20,870
Fujimoto Miki

13
00:00:19,500 --> 00:00:20,870
Hotta Akane

14
00:00:19,500 --> 00:00:20,870
Ichikawa Ebizou

15
00:00:20,670 --> 00:00:22,800
Somehow "My First Errand"

16
00:00:22,800 --> 00:00:26,470
has been on the air for 30 years.

17
00:00:26,470 --> 00:00:29,110
Has it been 30 years?

18
00:00:28,010 --> 00:00:29,110
That's right.

19
00:00:29,110 --> 00:00:31,910
Meaning you've been doing this show since you were 6?

20
00:00:31,910 --> 00:00:33,580
No need for math.

21
00:00:35,080 --> 00:00:40,620
And to commemorate those 30 we've brought some wonderful guests.

22
00:00:40,620 --> 00:00:42,650
Somehow we got Mr. Ebizou.

23
00:00:42,850 --> 00:00:46,460
Father of

24
00:00:42,850 --> 00:00:46,460
Splendid.

25
00:00:44,760 --> 00:00:46,460
Thank you very much.

26
00:00:46,460 --> 00:00:48,090
What I know is that

27
00:00:48,090 --> 00:00:51,760
he keeps writing about the program on his personal blog.

28
00:00:51,760 --> 00:00:53,700
The most famous fan.

29
00:00:53,700 --> 00:00:55,400
I always watch the show.

30
00:00:55,400 --> 00:00:56,900
Mikitty mama.

31
00:00:56,330 --> 00:00:56,900
Yes.

32
00:00:56,900 --> 00:01:00,810
One more is on its way.

33
00:00:57,900 --> 00:01:00,810
That's right.

34
00:00:58,000 --> 00:01:01,960
Pregnant

35
00:01:00,810 --> 00:01:02,010
Thanks for having me.

36
00:01:02,010 --> 00:01:03,980
What an amazing silhouette.

37
00:01:03,980 --> 00:01:06,650
Have a look at this.

38
00:01:05,080 --> 00:01:06,650
Huge.

39
00:01:06,650 --> 00:01:10,080
When are you due?

40
00:01:07,610 --> 00:01:10,080
I'm due at the end of this month.

41
00:01:10,080 --> 00:01:13,050
It's almost popping out already.

42
00:01:12,080 --> 00:01:13,050
The heck?

43
00:01:13,350 --> 00:01:14,950
Is it fine for you to be here?

44
00:01:14,120 --> 00:01:14,950
It's fine.

45
00:01:14,950 --> 00:01:17,620
I have so much free time while anticipating.

46
00:01:18,520 --> 00:01:20,930
Amami, what do you think of "Errand"?

47
00:01:20,930 --> 00:01:24,100
I always watch it and cry.

48
00:01:23,030 --> 00:01:26,970
Todays errands will also make you laugh and cry.

49
00:01:26,970 --> 00:01:30,070
The first errand is by a 4 year old boy.

50
00:01:31,040 --> 00:01:35,970
November last year a magnificent wedding was held in Tokyo.

51
00:01:35,970 --> 00:01:41,980
It's the wedding of a kid who went on his first errand 21 years ago.

52
00:01:41,980 --> 00:01:43,550
How amazing.

53
00:01:43,550 --> 00:01:47,020
It's not going well since it's the first time.

54
00:01:47,020 --> 00:01:51,290
He's laughing today but back then he cried hard.

55
00:01:51,290 --> 00:01:53,960
- Very traditional.
- So true.

56
00:01:54,260 --> 00:01:56,700
Keiichirou is 25 years old.

57
00:01:56,700 --> 00:02:01,470
His first errand was also a first for his parents.

58
00:02:01,470 --> 00:02:06,270
An errand that became an irreplaceable family memory.

59
00:02:06,270 --> 00:02:10,540
Let's show it to begin the 30 year anniversary special.

60
00:02:11,280 --> 00:02:16,150
21 years ago...

61
00:02:16,720 --> 00:02:19,620
On the day of moving out of the company provided housing

62
00:02:19,620 --> 00:02:24,120
Keiichirou went on his first errand.

63
00:02:24,120 --> 00:02:25,590
8 in the morning.

64
00:02:25,590 --> 00:02:28,730
They are ready to move out

65
00:02:28,730 --> 00:02:31,730
from the company housing where his parents married.

66
00:02:31,730 --> 00:02:35,130
They've lived here for 6 years and 3 months.

67
00:02:35,130 --> 00:02:40,310
Giving birth to a son and a daughter and becoming a 4 unit family.

68
00:02:40,310 --> 00:02:45,310
To the 4 year old Keiichirou this home has been the center of his entire life.

69
00:02:45,310 --> 00:02:47,850
Let's bring it all to the new house.

70
00:02:47,850 --> 00:02:52,180
His mother decided on this errand on the day of moving.

71
00:02:52,180 --> 00:02:58,090
She wants to teach Keiichirou the importance of saying your goodbyes.

72
00:03:00,030 --> 00:03:04,400
His two friends from the block who have known each other since they were babies.

73
00:03:04,400 --> 00:03:10,470
Parting with your dear friends for the first time is something his mother also has experienced.

74
00:03:12,240 --> 00:03:14,070
The moving truck has arrived.

75
00:03:14,070 --> 00:03:15,670
Keichan.

76
00:03:15,670 --> 00:03:19,580
It's already 10 so mama...

77
00:03:17,640 --> 00:03:19,580
She will make him go.

78
00:03:19,680 --> 00:03:21,580
Can you go on an errand?

79
00:03:21,580 --> 00:03:23,220
Where should I go?

80
00:03:23,220 --> 00:03:27,020
The picture that I took at the farewell party the other day...

81
00:03:27,020 --> 00:03:30,760
She took a picture that he was asked to print 2 copies from the photo store.

82
00:03:30,760 --> 00:03:33,830
This is the picture his father took at the farewell party.

83
00:03:32,590 --> 00:03:38,300
Shougo

84
00:03:32,590 --> 00:03:38,300
Yuusuke

85
00:03:33,830 --> 00:03:37,030
He will hand it to Shougo and Yuuseke.

86
00:03:36,960 --> 00:03:42,630
After that go greet your doctor Nakamura.

87
00:03:42,630 --> 00:03:44,770
Pediatric doctor Nakamura.

88
00:03:44,770 --> 00:03:47,710
She helped take care of his asthma.

89
00:03:47,710 --> 00:03:50,080
He's told to bring her flowers.

90
00:03:51,110 --> 00:03:54,480
And then there's this.

91
00:03:53,580 --> 00:03:54,480
Vegetables?

92
00:03:54,480 --> 00:03:56,780
Give it to Meichan?

93
00:03:55,710 --> 00:03:56,780
The goat Meichan.

94
00:03:56,780 --> 00:03:58,880
Since we didn't get to say bye the other day.

95
00:03:59,150 --> 00:04:01,550
Since we are moving.

96
00:04:01,550 --> 00:04:04,360
Let's play again.

97
00:04:04,360 --> 00:04:08,230
As a special treat on this day she's cut up fresh vegetables.

98
00:04:08,360 --> 00:04:12,630
He's got 3 people and a goat to say goodbye to. Better hurry!

99
00:04:12,630 --> 00:04:17,600
Kei, if you are slow then the truck will depart.

100
00:04:13,600 --> 00:04:15,370
It's papa.

101
00:04:15,370 --> 00:04:17,200
That would be tough.

102
00:04:17,600 --> 00:04:21,840
So I will give you this watch so you can keep track of time.

103
00:04:20,740 --> 00:04:21,840
Papas watch.

104
00:04:21,840 --> 00:04:25,180
How cool. Really makes you overcome anything.

105
00:04:25,180 --> 00:04:28,380
He still can't tell the time but he understands his fathers.

106
00:04:28,380 --> 00:04:31,220
Because the dial has an arrow that the hand can point to.

107
00:04:31,220 --> 00:04:35,750
Keiichirou, be back by then. He's given a 1 hour limit.

108
00:04:37,260 --> 00:04:39,520
It's all in the same block.

109
00:04:39,520 --> 00:04:43,500
Shougo, Yuuseke, the preschool teacher Nakamura and the goat Mei.

110
00:04:43,500 --> 00:04:46,030
It's an errand to say your goodbyes.

111
00:04:46,030 --> 00:04:47,000
Do your best.

112
00:04:47,970 --> 00:04:50,570
The oath between two men - a father and his son.

113
00:04:50,570 --> 00:04:52,500
I will do my best.

114
00:04:52,770 --> 00:04:54,140
Here we go.

115
00:04:54,140 --> 00:04:59,880
3 minutes away is the photo store inside of the supermarket his mother always shops at.

116
00:04:59,880 --> 00:05:06,080
All of Keiichirous pictures since his birth have been handled by this store.

117
00:05:06,080 --> 00:05:08,090
Please.

118
00:05:08,090 --> 00:05:10,090
Are you really moving away from here?

119
00:05:10,090 --> 00:05:13,120
Those 4 years have added up to 10 complete photo albums.

120
00:05:13,120 --> 00:05:16,960
He's become so big already. Goodbye.

121
00:05:17,630 --> 00:05:21,230
Next up he needs to pick up some flowers.

122
00:05:21,230 --> 00:05:24,370
Cause he's supposed to bring them to his teacher.

123
00:05:24,370 --> 00:05:27,610
He picked the doctors favorite peach blossoms and strawberries.

124
00:05:27,010 --> 00:05:29,270
How smart.

125
00:05:28,270 --> 00:05:31,080
He's always being welcomed even on days off.

126
00:05:31,080 --> 00:05:34,110
He's been taken really good care of.

127
00:05:34,110 --> 00:05:37,020
He's known her since he was 7 months old.

128
00:05:37,420 --> 00:05:40,520
Doctor.

129
00:05:38,250 --> 00:05:40,520
She's in the middle of a medical examination.

130
00:05:40,520 --> 00:05:42,050
He just walked in.

131
00:05:41,290 --> 00:05:43,120
I came by myself.

132
00:05:42,250 --> 00:05:43,820
To say goodbye.

133
00:05:44,320 --> 00:05:47,330
You will give this to me?

134
00:05:47,590 --> 00:05:49,930
I'm moving.

135
00:05:48,430 --> 00:05:49,930
You are moving?

136
00:05:49,930 --> 00:05:53,330
Saginomiya in Nakano ward.

137
00:05:52,360 --> 00:05:54,270
Very specific info.

138
00:05:53,330 --> 00:05:54,970
He is able to say it.

139
00:05:54,970 --> 00:05:57,970
Be kind to your sister Minako.

140
00:05:56,570 --> 00:05:57,970
Yes.

141
00:05:58,570 --> 00:06:00,610
Goodbye.

142
00:05:59,440 --> 00:06:01,370
So dry.

143
00:06:02,810 --> 00:06:07,250
Keiichirou that night you caught pneumonia was cutting it close.

144
00:06:07,250 --> 00:06:09,980
Your asthma will surely get better.

145
00:06:11,250 --> 00:06:15,120
He's checking the arrow on his fathers watch.

146
00:06:14,590 --> 00:06:16,490
That's right. He has to hurry.

147
00:06:16,350 --> 00:06:19,390
The truck is packed already.

148
00:06:20,530 --> 00:06:22,360
He's running again.

149
00:06:22,360 --> 00:06:24,600
He has arrived at Shougos house.

150
00:06:24,930 --> 00:06:28,600
The three of them are always together.

151
00:06:27,700 --> 00:06:28,930
He can't reach it.

152
00:06:30,700 --> 00:06:32,500
Are they not home?

153
00:06:32,500 --> 00:06:34,710
Despite having brought the photos.

154
00:06:34,710 --> 00:06:38,180
Despite wanting to say goodbye, Shou.

155
00:06:41,950 --> 00:06:44,150
Ah, they are inside.

156
00:06:43,350 --> 00:06:46,120
Oh, Keichan.

157
00:06:45,180 --> 00:06:46,120
Yes.

158
00:06:46,120 --> 00:06:48,790
Shou has forgotten about it.

159
00:06:48,790 --> 00:06:51,960
That Kei is leaving today.

160
00:06:51,990 --> 00:06:54,590
I didn't come to play. Here's a photo.

161
00:06:54,590 --> 00:06:57,030
One of them is for Shou.

162
00:06:56,590 --> 00:06:58,260
A picture from the goodbye party.

163
00:06:58,260 --> 00:07:01,430
That's right... Kei is leaving.

164
00:07:01,430 --> 00:07:04,170
As he realizes that Shou falls silent.

165
00:07:03,600 --> 00:07:05,640
Aww~ he must be sad.

166
00:07:04,170 --> 00:07:08,440
They really love each other but Shou is too shy to express it.

167
00:07:08,440 --> 00:07:11,140
Today he has to say goodbye.

168
00:07:11,140 --> 00:07:14,250
I will not always be here.

169
00:07:14,250 --> 00:07:17,550
The bashful Shou won't say a thing.

170
00:07:17,550 --> 00:07:21,290
With wide eyes he's holding back faint tears.

171
00:07:22,620 --> 00:07:25,120
The truck is waiting so he's leaving.

172
00:07:25,520 --> 00:07:27,730
Thank you Kei.

173
00:07:29,430 --> 00:07:30,800
Shou was acting weird.

174
00:07:31,460 --> 00:07:33,400
Despite having brought him a picture.

175
00:07:33,400 --> 00:07:36,030
He didn't even say bye bye.

176
00:07:35,600 --> 00:07:37,370
How sad.

177
00:07:38,070 --> 00:07:39,970
Time to hurry.

178
00:07:39,970 --> 00:07:42,240
Papas watch says...

179
00:07:42,240 --> 00:07:46,810
It's still fine. There are 30 minutes left.

180
00:07:46,080 --> 00:07:47,760
He's properly paying attention.

181
00:07:47,580 --> 00:07:49,750
There she is, Meichan.

182
00:07:49,750 --> 00:07:54,120
Meichan is the baby goat kept by the children's center.

183
00:07:54,120 --> 00:07:57,120
He's been feeding her for 1 year.

184
00:07:57,460 --> 00:07:59,260
Scary, scary, scary.

185
00:08:01,530 --> 00:08:05,900
They couldn't keep animals at the company housing but he was glad to have Meichan.

186
00:08:05,900 --> 00:08:07,470
Thank you.

187
00:08:08,000 --> 00:08:13,810
Broccoli stems. His mother has packed it with Meichan's favorites.

188
00:08:13,510 --> 00:08:14,870
I see.

189
00:08:15,440 --> 00:08:17,940
Will he ever be able to feed her again.

190
00:08:18,140 --> 00:08:20,950
Saginomiya is far from here, Meichan.

191
00:08:21,380 --> 00:08:24,020
He's suddenly becoming melancholic.

192
00:08:29,350 --> 00:08:31,520
Please eat it all.

193
00:08:31,520 --> 00:08:33,790
When you do I have to leave.

194
00:08:35,930 --> 00:08:39,300
Suddenly he remembers his dads watch.

195
00:08:47,710 --> 00:08:49,240
What happened?

196
00:08:48,340 --> 00:08:50,580
The time has passed.

197
00:08:50,240 --> 00:08:52,110
The time passed?

198
00:08:53,310 --> 00:08:55,510
He's running all he can.

199
00:08:55,780 --> 00:08:59,220
Mom, dad and the truck is not there.

200
00:09:00,720 --> 00:09:02,850
They left...

201
00:09:03,350 --> 00:09:04,820
You thought we had left?

202
00:09:04,820 --> 00:09:06,820
Everyone was still there.

203
00:09:06,820 --> 00:09:09,590
It's not like they can just leave Keiichirou behind.

204
00:09:10,260 --> 00:09:13,100
Will you go to Yuusuke's house?

205
00:09:13,100 --> 00:09:14,930
I won't go.

206
00:09:14,100 --> 00:09:15,600
He was scared.

207
00:09:15,670 --> 00:09:17,640
I won't go.

208
00:09:16,870 --> 00:09:21,710
He really believed that they had left him for good.

209
00:09:18,940 --> 00:09:21,710
You are able to go by yourself now.

210
00:09:22,010 --> 00:09:25,010
Go while I clean up.

211
00:09:25,880 --> 00:09:28,180
Go and see Yuusuke.

212
00:09:28,180 --> 00:09:32,020
Are you okay with not seeing him again. He's probably waiting at his house.

213
00:09:33,990 --> 00:09:36,350
The fright from thinking he was abandoned.

214
00:09:36,350 --> 00:09:42,290
He wasn't able to go Yuusuke's house so his regret made him suddenly dejected back at home.

215
00:09:44,630 --> 00:09:47,970
But his mother intends to make him go again.

216
00:09:48,430 --> 00:09:50,030
I forgot to go to

217
00:09:50,030 --> 00:09:52,600
Yuuseke's house.

218
00:09:51,500 --> 00:09:54,840
His father also intends to make him go again.

219
00:09:54,840 --> 00:09:59,180
They'll be sad if you didn't go and just cried.

220
00:09:56,140 --> 00:09:59,180
You're a strong boy, aren't you?

221
00:09:59,480 --> 00:10:01,980
Let's bring it in again with Minako.

222
00:10:02,380 --> 00:10:06,020
His father used to be in the rugby club in Keio University.

223
00:10:06,020 --> 00:10:08,020
An oath between men.

224
00:10:06,990 --> 00:10:08,020
Alright.

225
00:10:08,290 --> 00:10:10,560
Keiichirou is not alone.

226
00:10:10,560 --> 00:10:12,890
The 4 unit family is one team.

227
00:10:13,560 --> 00:10:15,660
I will do my best.

228
00:10:17,500 --> 00:10:20,970
His father gave him his handkerchief.

229
00:10:20,970 --> 00:10:24,270
And told him to wipe his tears and go.

230
00:10:25,000 --> 00:10:26,540
We will be waiting.

231
00:10:26,540 --> 00:10:28,540
Hoping to make Keiichirou

232
00:10:29,810 --> 00:10:32,280
properly say his goodbyes to this town.

233
00:10:32,280 --> 00:10:35,650
The entertaining park, the back streets he ran through

234
00:10:35,650 --> 00:10:37,480
and his beloved friends.

235
00:10:37,480 --> 00:10:39,420
Here's Yuusuke's house.

236
00:10:39,420 --> 00:10:42,020
The stairs he climbed every day.

237
00:10:47,530 --> 00:10:48,730
Yes?

238
00:10:49,630 --> 00:10:51,460
It's Hara.

239
00:10:50,630 --> 00:10:52,200
Kei-chan?

240
00:10:51,460 --> 00:10:52,200
Yes.

241
00:10:52,500 --> 00:10:54,430
He stopped crying.

242
00:10:54,430 --> 00:10:57,600
Did you come by yourself?

243
00:10:57,770 --> 00:10:59,470
Come in.

244
00:11:00,510 --> 00:11:02,570
It's just that...

245
00:11:02,570 --> 00:11:04,010
Photos.

246
00:11:04,010 --> 00:11:05,880
He gave it to him.

247
00:11:06,410 --> 00:11:09,710
Kei-chan? What's going on?

248
00:11:13,850 --> 00:11:15,390
His fathers handkerchief.

249
00:11:15,390 --> 00:11:17,890
The handkerchief to wipe away the tears.

250
00:11:24,960 --> 00:11:26,700
Thank you.

251
00:11:26,700 --> 00:11:29,730
Why are you crying that much?

252
00:11:28,170 --> 00:11:30,640
Because you are crying.

253
00:11:30,640 --> 00:11:33,200
Why are you crying, Kei?

254
00:11:34,140 --> 00:11:38,410
Previously when... came home #!&%...

255
00:11:38,410 --> 00:11:41,850
He was about to leave without saying good bye.

256
00:11:42,150 --> 00:11:43,820
Yuusuke's prized possession.

257
00:11:44,180 --> 00:11:49,020
He's giving his Toy Story figures of Woody, Buzz and Rex.

258
00:11:48,590 --> 00:11:50,590
Those are indeed prized items.

259
00:11:49,820 --> 00:11:51,660
It's fine.

260
00:11:52,590 --> 00:11:56,730
You don't have to give them. I already have lots of toys.

261
00:12:05,570 --> 00:12:07,000
Thank you.

262
00:12:07,000 --> 00:12:08,210
And...

263
00:12:08,210 --> 00:12:11,080
Bye bye.

264
00:12:16,350 --> 00:12:19,080
Having made so many precious memories.

265
00:12:19,080 --> 00:12:21,790
Heading towards a new home.

266
00:12:22,490 --> 00:12:25,120
He's tired for the day.

267
00:12:25,120 --> 00:12:30,130
Cause he has filled his minds photo album with memories.

268
00:12:29,560 --> 00:12:31,200
He did his best.

269
00:12:32,660 --> 00:12:34,630
Goodbye Shou.

270
00:12:34,630 --> 00:12:36,630
Goodbye Yuusuke.

271
00:12:36,630 --> 00:12:39,970
Everyone, everyone, be well.

272
00:12:42,010 --> 00:12:44,940
To fill his heart with goodbyes

273
00:12:44,940 --> 00:12:48,910
opens his eyes and makes him ready to face his next home.

274
00:12:49,410 --> 00:12:53,580
Keiichirou what follows goodbye is hello.

275
00:12:54,250 --> 00:12:58,920
A "hello errand" is waiting for you in a new town.

276
00:13:03,730 --> 00:13:07,170
21 years later.

277
00:13:05,530 --> 00:13:06,960
Amazing.

278
00:13:09,130 --> 00:13:11,670
Saying hello again

279
00:13:11,670 --> 00:13:14,910
to Mami who he met at his company's initiation ceremony.

280
00:13:14,910 --> 00:13:19,380
He grew up like this.

281
00:13:20,040 --> 00:13:23,650
Keiichirou is a new employee at a major food company.

282
00:13:23,650 --> 00:13:26,550
He has just started his salaryman life.

283
00:13:27,020 --> 00:13:29,720
Dad, he has risen from the ranks.

284
00:13:29,720 --> 00:13:32,960
And his relationship to his parents is great.

285
00:13:33,590 --> 00:13:37,730
It's still running smoothly.

286
00:13:34,990 --> 00:13:36,560
It's still running?

287
00:13:36,630 --> 00:13:39,230
It's running.

288
00:13:38,060 --> 00:13:40,460
It's the watch from back then.

289
00:13:40,460 --> 00:13:46,240
I don't use it much but I just can't throw it out.

290
00:13:44,400 --> 00:13:46,240
I see.

291
00:13:46,670 --> 00:13:48,210
This.

292
00:13:48,210 --> 00:13:52,340
To commemorate your first errand.

293
00:13:50,510 --> 00:13:52,340
Is that what he has planned.

294
00:13:53,910 --> 00:13:55,480
Let's get a shot with you and dad.

295
00:13:57,010 --> 00:14:04,260
The watch matches him as he has taken after his beloved cool dad.

296
00:14:07,690 --> 00:14:11,600
The Japanese rugby captain Tanaka's son's first errand.

297
00:14:12,700 --> 00:14:17,270
"I will carry it just like my beloved dad" but it ends up in a sticky situation.

298
00:14:16,830 --> 00:14:18,370
It's falling out.

299
00:14:18,370 --> 00:14:20,170
It's coming out.

300
00:14:20,270 --> 00:14:24,940
So moving that it even exceeds his fathers' expectations.

301
00:14:25,440 --> 00:14:29,380
It has been wonderful right from the start.

302
00:14:29,380 --> 00:14:31,980
It was like a movie.

303
00:14:30,080 --> 00:14:31,980
Yeah, it was so moving.

304
00:14:31,980 --> 00:14:35,320
Mister Ebizou you were also teary-eyed.

305
00:14:35,390 --> 00:14:37,590
Is that right?

306
00:14:38,060 --> 00:14:41,060
This show really throws you off your guard.

307
00:14:41,060 --> 00:14:43,130
You get hit from all directions.

308
00:14:43,130 --> 00:14:45,460
The kid himself but also the people around him

309
00:14:45,460 --> 00:14:48,230
and for the crying mother who clearly knows what's going on.

310
00:14:48,230 --> 00:14:51,100
But she was just moved to see his emotional expression.

311
00:14:51,100 --> 00:14:52,800
It really throws you off your guard.

312
00:14:53,470 --> 00:14:55,940
This is dangerous.

313
00:14:55,940 --> 00:14:58,780
I had to avert my eyes.

314
00:14:57,170 --> 00:14:58,780
No, please look.

315
00:14:58,780 --> 00:14:59,480
And Amami?

316
00:14:59,480 --> 00:15:02,110
My nose immediately started to drip.

317
00:15:02,110 --> 00:15:04,180
Unexpecedly early on.

318
00:15:04,180 --> 00:15:08,520
Yuusuke was also a great kid. Wanting to give his prized possesion.

319
00:15:08,520 --> 00:15:10,990
It's amazing that kids can refuse such an offer.

320
00:15:10,990 --> 00:15:13,930
Kids will say "I don't need it".

321
00:15:13,930 --> 00:15:17,430
Don't they understand what the toys mean to the other kids?

322
00:15:17,430 --> 00:15:21,870
Kanbanmusume (literally: poster girl): A pretty girl who attracts customers to come inside a shop.

323
00:15:17,430 --> 00:15:21,870
Next up is the poster girl at a sushi restaurant.

324
00:15:22,570 --> 00:15:25,300
Shizuoka ● Itou city

325
00:15:22,570 --> 00:15:27,540
In the hot spring district of Itou, Izu Prefecture, where easygoing (Nonki) sushi can be found at Nonki sushi.

326
00:15:27,540 --> 00:15:29,170
It's a high-end sushi restaurant.

327
00:15:29,710 --> 00:15:31,880
The dad is a second generation chef.

328
00:15:31,880 --> 00:15:35,410
Close to the ocean and the mountains so the ingredients are abundant.

329
00:15:35,980 --> 00:15:41,390
Mazuma wasabi from Amagi and the golden eye snapper from Shimoda which is a bit fatty.

330
00:15:40,380 --> 00:15:42,450
Looks delicious.

331
00:15:42,850 --> 00:15:48,730
It's on a road where few cars pass by so this is a stop that people go out of their way to make.

332
00:15:50,390 --> 00:15:51,900
It's a family-run establishment.

333
00:15:52,100 --> 00:15:57,030
The proprietress is the grandmother and the great-grandmother is the great-proprietress.

334
00:15:53,600 --> 00:15:57,030
Grandmother.

335
00:15:53,600 --> 00:15:57,030
Great-grandmother.

336
00:15:57,270 --> 00:16:00,570
Little miss proprietress, please also do it here.

337
00:16:00,570 --> 00:16:01,910
Little miss proprietress.

338
00:16:02,240 --> 00:16:04,380
Please make it sparkle.

339
00:16:04,380 --> 00:16:10,080
This is Yuna. She's in work-mode when she wears an apron.

340
00:16:10,210 --> 00:16:14,320
When we are here and you have an apron on what do you call me?

341
00:16:15,290 --> 00:16:17,360
Master.

342
00:16:16,120 --> 00:16:17,360
Yes.

343
00:16:17,360 --> 00:16:19,820
Today she is hosting at the masters' restaurant.

344
00:16:20,290 --> 00:16:22,660
I look forward to working with you the entire day.

345
00:16:22,660 --> 00:16:28,770
To put the young proprietress on her first errand the master has thought of a trick.

346
00:16:31,500 --> 00:16:33,800
The proprietress-to-be, her mother.

347
00:16:34,910 --> 00:16:37,210
Hello? This is Nonki Sushi.

348
00:16:37,270 --> 00:16:39,310
Taking an order over the phone.

349
00:16:40,340 --> 00:16:43,110
The homepa spread?

350
00:16:43,110 --> 00:16:46,320
Homepa spread for home parties.

351
00:16:45,520 --> 00:16:47,640
Homepa?

352
00:16:46,750 --> 00:16:48,420
Master.

353
00:16:47,250 --> 00:16:48,420
Yes.

354
00:16:48,420 --> 00:16:51,860
Can you make a homepa spread for four right away?

355
00:16:52,060 --> 00:16:53,720
For four? Got it.

356
00:16:53,720 --> 00:16:55,930
He will be busy. Furthermore...

357
00:16:55,930 --> 00:16:58,430
One of them can't eat raw fish so...

358
00:16:58,760 --> 00:17:02,870
No raw fish? I haven't prepared any such ingredients today.

359
00:17:01,400 --> 00:17:02,870
A realistic performance.

360
00:17:02,870 --> 00:17:04,570
Asking for no raw fish to a sushi restaurant.

361
00:17:04,740 --> 00:17:07,770
Hey hey, listen to what the master is saying.

362
00:17:08,370 --> 00:17:10,670
White radish sprouts, avocado and cucumbers.

363
00:17:10,670 --> 00:17:11,780
We don't have cucumbers?

364
00:17:11,780 --> 00:17:14,010
This is the errand. Please listen.

365
00:17:14,310 --> 00:17:15,550
What should we do?

366
00:17:15,810 --> 00:17:17,280
Hey Yuna....

367
00:17:17,920 --> 00:17:19,750
We have to do some shopping

368
00:17:19,750 --> 00:17:21,320
can you go buy some?

369
00:17:21,320 --> 00:17:23,720
Today?

370
00:17:24,320 --> 00:17:27,490
I will go on an errand.

371
00:17:26,820 --> 00:17:27,490
Will you go?

372
00:17:27,860 --> 00:17:28,690
Can you go?

373
00:17:29,090 --> 00:17:30,060
Really?

374
00:17:30,490 --> 00:17:31,460
I can go.

375
00:17:31,530 --> 00:17:33,760
Off I go.

376
00:17:32,400 --> 00:17:33,760
Wait a bit.

377
00:17:34,030 --> 00:17:35,130
She's eager.

378
00:17:35,200 --> 00:17:41,270
Big brother.

379
00:17:35,200 --> 00:17:41,310
Yuna

380
00:17:35,800 --> 00:17:38,500
Actually her brother recently had his errand debut

381
00:17:38,500 --> 00:17:41,440
and she's been asking enthusiastically "When can I go?"

382
00:17:41,110 --> 00:17:42,170
I see.

383
00:17:41,970 --> 00:17:43,770
Going to the supermarket nearby.

384
00:17:43,770 --> 00:17:47,980
She needs to get white radish sprouts, avocado and cucumber for the sushi.

385
00:17:47,980 --> 00:17:51,680
On top of that, spring onions and 20 plates.

386
00:17:51,680 --> 00:17:54,990
The shop is nearby, but that's tough.

387
00:17:55,820 --> 00:17:58,990
This is my first time going by myself.

388
00:17:57,590 --> 00:17:58,990
Yes, it's your first time.

389
00:17:58,990 --> 00:18:01,030
It's your "First Errand".

390
00:18:01,030 --> 00:18:04,230
You can't lose. Do your best.

391
00:18:01,860 --> 00:18:04,230
I will not lose.

392
00:18:05,660 --> 00:18:06,700
Off you go.

393
00:18:08,280 --> 00:18:10,620
Bye bye.

394
00:18:09,270 --> 00:18:10,630
Off you go.

395
00:18:11,240 --> 00:18:13,570
I will not lose.

396
00:18:14,210 --> 00:18:18,010
There's a mic in the good-luck charm that has "I won't lose" written on it.

397
00:18:18,010 --> 00:18:21,510
It's what Yuna always says during crucial moments.

398
00:18:21,910 --> 00:18:26,080
With those words her mother intends to make her do her utmost.

399
00:18:27,120 --> 00:18:35,160
It's neither hot nor cold in the clear autumnal weather as the little miss proprietress is going shopping.

400
00:18:35,960 --> 00:18:39,400
Today I was asked to go on an errand.

401
00:18:39,400 --> 00:18:41,370
It's my first time.

402
00:18:42,230 --> 00:18:44,340
An errand?

403
00:18:43,000 --> 00:18:44,340
Yep.

404
00:18:44,340 --> 00:18:45,740
How admirable.

405
00:18:46,000 --> 00:18:48,610
Since she is the proprietress of Nonki Sushi.

406
00:18:49,470 --> 00:18:53,180
She has arrived at the crossing. The supermarket is on the other side.

407
00:18:53,180 --> 00:18:57,920
Her mother gave her stamp of approval and told us that she knows to follow the traffic laws.

408
00:18:57,550 --> 00:18:59,250
How cool.

409
00:18:59,550 --> 00:19:00,520
Right

410
00:19:00,520 --> 00:19:01,450
Left

411
00:19:01,450 --> 00:19:02,420
Right

412
00:19:02,420 --> 00:19:03,490
Left

413
00:19:03,490 --> 00:19:05,520
It's fine. I will proceed.

414
00:19:05,390 --> 00:19:06,620
How remarkable.

415
00:19:06,990 --> 00:19:09,560
After the verification she swiftly crosses.

416
00:19:10,530 --> 00:19:12,200
How pleasant.

417
00:19:13,060 --> 00:19:15,770
Crossing and going around the corner.

418
00:19:16,200 --> 00:19:18,300
The shop is within sight.

419
00:19:18,740 --> 00:19:24,440
She was asked to get all these things. Will she remember them all?

420
00:19:24,440 --> 00:19:27,910
My first errand.

421
00:19:27,950 --> 00:19:30,150
What will she look for first?

422
00:19:30,150 --> 00:19:32,420
Where are the cucumbers?

423
00:19:32,420 --> 00:19:33,980
She starts looking for cucumbers.

424
00:19:34,250 --> 00:19:37,860
I wonder where the cucumbers are.

425
00:19:36,150 --> 00:19:37,860
Aah, it's behind her.

426
00:19:37,860 --> 00:19:41,530
She's a beginner driver at handling the cart.

427
00:19:42,630 --> 00:19:44,300
Ooh.

428
00:19:44,730 --> 00:19:47,400
I will go and ask then.

429
00:19:45,960 --> 00:19:47,830
How admirable.

430
00:19:47,500 --> 00:19:50,200
She has arrived at the cashier.

431
00:19:48,570 --> 00:19:50,200
Errand. Errand.

432
00:19:50,200 --> 00:19:52,900
Wonder who I should ask.

433
00:19:53,170 --> 00:19:55,640
I came all by myself.

434
00:19:56,570 --> 00:19:58,180
She wants to ask someone but...

435
00:19:58,180 --> 00:20:00,740
I don't know all by myself.

436
00:20:00,980 --> 00:20:03,650
she doesn't know who to ask.

437
00:20:04,780 --> 00:20:07,850
Great. She went back to the vegetable section.

438
00:20:08,650 --> 00:20:10,960
Errand'ing is tiring.

439
00:20:10,960 --> 00:20:13,360
This is different from her expectations.

440
00:20:14,790 --> 00:20:17,230
The cucumbers are right over there.

441
00:20:18,330 --> 00:20:22,700
I must do this errand all by myself.

442
00:20:22,700 --> 00:20:25,740
What did you come to purchase?

443
00:20:24,540 --> 00:20:27,810
I want to purchase cucumbers.

444
00:20:25,740 --> 00:20:28,640
Cucumbers are right over there.

445
00:20:28,640 --> 00:20:30,270
Did you get it?

446
00:20:30,270 --> 00:20:31,910
Thank you.

447
00:20:31,910 --> 00:20:33,540
Thank you very much.

448
00:20:33,140 --> 00:20:35,050
How great.

449
00:20:34,450 --> 00:20:36,080
Found it. Cucumbers.

450
00:20:36,680 --> 00:20:39,520
For the no-fish spread she needs to get enough for two.

451
00:20:39,520 --> 00:20:42,920
So one is not enough.

452
00:20:42,920 --> 00:20:46,690
I will take two cucumbers.

453
00:20:46,690 --> 00:20:49,190
That's right. She was asked to get two.

454
00:20:50,090 --> 00:20:52,100
But sure. It's fine to get three too.

455
00:20:53,830 --> 00:20:55,200
You are getting four?

456
00:20:55,200 --> 00:20:57,940
Since it's a sushi restaurant they can easily use it.

457
00:20:58,640 --> 00:21:00,440
That was the cucumber.

458
00:21:01,310 --> 00:21:03,010
And what's next?

459
00:21:04,440 --> 00:21:06,910
Avocado. Avocado.

460
00:21:06,910 --> 00:21:09,150
She remember the avocado.

461
00:21:09,680 --> 00:21:11,680
But she doesn't know where to find it.

462
00:21:11,680 --> 00:21:14,390
Let me politely ask for help.

463
00:21:14,050 --> 00:21:15,620
How remarkable.

464
00:21:14,920 --> 00:21:19,190
She decided to ask for avocados at the cashier.

465
00:21:21,060 --> 00:21:24,530
I will do my best despite being lonely.

466
00:21:24,530 --> 00:21:26,530
She's been feeling lonely so far.

467
00:21:26,530 --> 00:21:29,000
So that's why she was talking so much.

468
00:21:29,000 --> 00:21:31,970
She intends to ask: "Where are the avocados?"

469
00:21:32,270 --> 00:21:34,470
She took the cucumbers.

470
00:21:34,470 --> 00:21:37,440
Do you have a wallet?

471
00:21:35,770 --> 00:21:37,440
I do.

472
00:21:37,440 --> 00:21:40,380
She mistakenly ended up purchasing only the cucumbers.

473
00:21:39,340 --> 00:21:42,850
There's still so much to get.

474
00:21:42,110 --> 00:21:46,620
She paid, got her change but stayed at the cashier.

475
00:21:47,320 --> 00:21:49,850
Bye bye.

476
00:21:48,690 --> 00:21:53,260
She completely forgot all about the avocados.

477
00:21:53,260 --> 00:21:55,590
I will go this way.

478
00:21:55,760 --> 00:21:57,260
This is gonna be boring sushi.

479
00:21:58,360 --> 00:22:01,130
I bought the cucumbers but...

480
00:22:01,130 --> 00:22:03,970
It was no good.

481
00:22:04,080 --> 00:22:08,270
Mama.  I bought the cucumbers.

482
00:22:08,270 --> 00:22:10,370
You only bought cucumbers?

483
00:22:09,640 --> 00:22:10,370
Yeah.

484
00:22:10,370 --> 00:22:11,240
She remembered.

485
00:22:11,240 --> 00:22:15,410
There were no avocados.

486
00:22:13,610 --> 00:22:15,410
They said there were no avocados?

487
00:22:16,080 --> 00:22:17,650
Thank you for the cucumber.

488
00:22:17,650 --> 00:22:20,250
I will go back and shop again.

489
00:22:20,420 --> 00:22:21,650
4 more things to get.

490
00:22:20,420 --> 00:22:23,720
How remarkable.

491
00:22:21,650 --> 00:22:23,720
4 more things to get?

492
00:22:23,720 --> 00:22:25,720
It wasn't just avocados.

493
00:22:26,120 --> 00:22:29,190
I better go again then.

494
00:22:30,390 --> 00:22:31,430
You won't lose.

495
00:22:31,560 --> 00:22:33,630
I won't lose.

496
00:22:33,060 --> 00:22:33,630
Alright.

497
00:22:33,630 --> 00:22:35,670
I'm taking off.

498
00:22:34,330 --> 00:22:35,670
Off you go.

499
00:22:36,900 --> 00:22:39,770
Radish sprouts.

500
00:22:39,770 --> 00:22:41,810
Did she forget the avocados?

501
00:22:41,810 --> 00:22:45,240
Radish sprouts.

502
00:22:45,240 --> 00:22:46,710
Radish sprouts.

503
00:22:46,710 --> 00:22:49,950
Also spring onions, avocados and plates.

504
00:22:50,380 --> 00:22:52,850
Radish sprouts.  Radish sprouts.

505
00:22:52,850 --> 00:22:54,450
Back at the supermarket.

506
00:22:54,450 --> 00:22:58,290
What is left is radish sprouts, avocado, spring onions and plates.

507
00:22:58,720 --> 00:23:00,560
Radish sprouts.

508
00:23:01,090 --> 00:23:03,060
She arrives in high spirits.

509
00:23:03,060 --> 00:23:04,760
Hello.

510
00:23:04,760 --> 00:23:09,200
I'm on an errand.

511
00:23:05,760 --> 00:23:09,200
You are on an errand? How remarkable.

512
00:23:09,200 --> 00:23:13,000
Done with the greetings. Time for shopping.

513
00:23:14,340 --> 00:23:17,170
Where are the spring onions?

514
00:23:15,540 --> 00:23:17,570
She remembered!

515
00:23:17,170 --> 00:23:19,080
Spring onions?

516
00:23:20,180 --> 00:23:23,250
Spring onions.

517
00:23:23,250 --> 00:23:26,680
Found it. I found it.

518
00:23:25,750 --> 00:23:27,990
It's one of the four types on sale.

519
00:23:30,390 --> 00:23:33,090
Now there's only 3 items left.

520
00:23:33,090 --> 00:23:36,790
Let's hope she doesn't immediately go to the cashier.

521
00:23:36,790 --> 00:23:40,800
Radish sprouts.

522
00:23:38,130 --> 00:23:40,800
She remembered.

523
00:23:41,130 --> 00:23:43,200
Oh no, she's heading for the cashier.

524
00:23:43,670 --> 00:23:46,670
Somebody. I don't know how.

525
00:23:46,670 --> 00:23:49,670
Avocados and Thai Curry (kaiware => taikare).

526
00:23:49,670 --> 00:23:53,240
Where are the avocados and radish sprouts.

527
00:23:53,240 --> 00:23:54,710
Great, she corrected herself.

528
00:23:54,240 --> 00:23:56,280
Great she corrected herself.

529
00:23:55,380 --> 00:23:58,320
Store manager, store manager.
Come to checkout Nr. 1.

530
00:23:57,250 --> 00:23:58,320
Store manager!?

531
00:23:58,620 --> 00:24:00,820
Store manager. Store manager.

532
00:24:01,080 --> 00:24:04,960
It's a crucial matter. Here's the store manager.

533
00:24:04,960 --> 00:24:07,320
Hello. What do you need?

534
00:24:07,320 --> 00:24:08,960
Radish sprouts and...

535
00:24:08,960 --> 00:24:11,090
Radish sprouts and...

536
00:24:11,090 --> 00:24:13,230
steamed fish paste.

537
00:24:13,660 --> 00:24:15,470
Steamed fish paste?

538
00:24:13,930 --> 00:24:15,470
It surely changed.

539
00:24:15,470 --> 00:24:18,040
Avocado became kamaboko.

540
00:24:18,040 --> 00:24:20,740
If you say it out loud they do sound similar.

541
00:24:20,740 --> 00:24:21,540
Or not...?

542
00:24:21,570 --> 00:24:23,510
It's connected by the "bo".

543
00:24:22,470 --> 00:24:23,510
I see.

544
00:24:24,140 --> 00:24:26,340
Is this the one?

545
00:24:25,210 --> 00:24:26,340
Yep.

546
00:24:26,340 --> 00:24:28,550
Will one be enough?

547
00:24:28,550 --> 00:24:29,310
Two boxes.

548
00:24:29,450 --> 00:24:30,610
Two, right?

549
00:24:32,320 --> 00:24:33,680
Thank you.

550
00:24:33,680 --> 00:24:36,590
Not Thai curry but radish sprouts.

551
00:24:36,590 --> 00:24:38,760
And kamaboko.

552
00:24:37,720 --> 00:24:38,760
Kamaboko?

553
00:24:38,760 --> 00:24:41,020
Let's go together then.

554
00:24:39,420 --> 00:24:41,020
Kamaboko, huh?

555
00:24:41,020 --> 00:24:43,760
Was it not kamaboko?

556
00:24:43,760 --> 00:24:45,900
She senses that it's kinda wrong.

557
00:24:47,900 --> 00:24:49,670
But here they are.

558
00:24:50,970 --> 00:24:53,440
So it was kamaboko.

559
00:24:53,440 --> 00:24:55,410
Kamaboko, huh?

560
00:24:57,010 --> 00:24:58,940
Is that fine?

561
00:24:59,710 --> 00:25:02,150
She put in two kamaboko pastes.

562
00:25:02,380 --> 00:25:05,820
Is there more?

563
00:25:03,710 --> 00:25:05,820
No.

564
00:25:05,820 --> 00:25:07,620
Huh? And the paper plates?

565
00:25:07,620 --> 00:25:09,750
Bye bye.

566
00:25:08,390 --> 00:25:09,750
Bye bye.

567
00:25:09,750 --> 00:25:13,420
Seems like her head was full of radish sprouts.

568
00:25:14,320 --> 00:25:16,960
I'm home.

569
00:25:15,030 --> 00:25:16,960
You are back?

570
00:25:15,590 --> 00:25:17,790
What a grand errand.

571
00:25:17,390 --> 00:25:19,630
Welcome home.

572
00:25:19,730 --> 00:25:21,800
You bought the spring onions?

573
00:25:21,800 --> 00:25:23,970
Did you purchase more?

574
00:25:24,640 --> 00:25:27,600
This is it. Radish sprouts.

575
00:25:27,600 --> 00:25:30,740
I bought yet another radish sprout box.

576
00:25:28,710 --> 00:25:30,740
Ah two. Proper.

577
00:25:30,740 --> 00:25:33,640
Amazing. Amazing.

578
00:25:31,310 --> 00:25:33,640
I accidentally purchased kamaboko.

579
00:25:33,640 --> 00:25:35,080
She did notice that it was wrong.

580
00:25:35,080 --> 00:25:37,550
I didn't ask for kamaboko.

581
00:25:38,150 --> 00:25:40,650
Steamed fish paste, huh.

582
00:25:38,480 --> 00:25:40,650
I didn't say steamed fish paste but...

583
00:25:40,650 --> 00:25:42,190
We could put it in the dish.

584
00:25:42,190 --> 00:25:44,390
You better do. Put it in.

585
00:25:44,390 --> 00:25:45,820
And avocado?

586
00:25:46,590 --> 00:25:48,730
Did you ask?

587
00:25:48,730 --> 00:25:49,890
Huh?

588
00:25:51,330 --> 00:25:54,160
I forgot.

589
00:25:55,070 --> 00:25:56,670
Then, Yuna...

590
00:25:56,670 --> 00:25:58,370
Can you go again?

591
00:25:58,440 --> 00:25:59,270
Can you?

592
00:25:59,270 --> 00:26:00,300
Yeah.

593
00:25:59,540 --> 00:26:01,410
She's going again?

594
00:26:00,300 --> 00:26:02,110
You won't lose.

595
00:26:00,870 --> 00:26:02,110
I won't lose.

596
00:26:02,110 --> 00:26:05,010
She's not giving up, the little proprietress.

597
00:26:05,480 --> 00:26:07,410
Avocados.

598
00:26:07,410 --> 00:26:09,350
Avocados.

599
00:26:09,610 --> 00:26:13,850
The third time she repeats "avocados".

600
00:26:12,620 --> 00:26:14,400
That's good.

601
00:26:19,060 --> 00:26:21,360
I'm back again?

602
00:26:25,030 --> 00:26:26,360
That's right. Avocados.

603
00:26:26,360 --> 00:26:30,970
Avocado.

604
00:26:26,700 --> 00:26:29,100
Hurry up and go ask.

605
00:26:30,970 --> 00:26:32,440
That's the flow.

606
00:26:34,200 --> 00:26:37,170
She heads straight to the cashier.

607
00:26:38,740 --> 00:26:40,640
For grandma...

608
00:26:41,410 --> 00:26:44,010
I better get a present.

609
00:26:44,010 --> 00:26:46,220
She's doing unnecessary things again.

610
00:26:46,220 --> 00:26:48,850
Her grandmas favorite food is Mitarashi dango.

611
00:26:48,850 --> 00:26:50,690
She went straight to the checkout.

612
00:26:50,190 --> 00:26:51,660
She went to the cashier.

613
00:26:51,820 --> 00:26:54,930
Welcome. Is dango all you need?

614
00:26:54,930 --> 00:26:59,260
Avocados and paper plates.

615
00:26:58,430 --> 00:27:00,560
How good.

616
00:26:59,260 --> 00:27:01,000
She was able to say it this time.

617
00:27:01,370 --> 00:27:02,300
She doesn't know...

618
00:27:02,300 --> 00:27:05,800
Store manager, please come to checkout Nr. 7.

619
00:27:03,100 --> 00:27:05,400
The store manager again.

620
00:27:05,840 --> 00:27:09,870
The store manager has been put in charge of the small proprietress.

621
00:27:09,710 --> 00:27:11,440
In charge.

622
00:27:13,310 --> 00:27:15,050
What do you need?

623
00:27:15,150 --> 00:27:18,920
Avocados and...

624
00:27:16,380 --> 00:27:18,920
Avocados and...

625
00:27:20,020 --> 00:27:23,290
Avocados and you see...

626
00:27:23,190 --> 00:27:25,160
Please remember.

627
00:27:25,190 --> 00:27:27,020
paper plates.

628
00:27:27,020 --> 00:27:31,290
Paper plates and avocados. Let's go together.

629
00:27:30,690 --> 00:27:31,290
Yep.

630
00:27:31,290 --> 00:27:33,630
Apologies for keeping you busy, store manager.

631
00:27:35,030 --> 00:27:36,970
Getting two.

632
00:27:36,970 --> 00:27:39,370
I will pick this and that.

633
00:27:39,500 --> 00:27:40,270
Alright.

634
00:27:40,270 --> 00:27:41,470
And what else?

635
00:27:41,470 --> 00:27:43,770
Paper plates.

636
00:27:45,010 --> 00:27:46,480
Here are the paper plates.

637
00:27:47,680 --> 00:27:49,850
This is great.

638
00:27:49,850 --> 00:27:51,080
This is great.

639
00:27:51,080 --> 00:27:52,150
Is that alright?

640
00:27:51,680 --> 00:27:52,150
Yep.

641
00:27:52,150 --> 00:27:54,020
Alright. Bye bye.

642
00:27:52,850 --> 00:27:54,020
Bye bye.

643
00:27:55,550 --> 00:27:58,090
She has finally gotten all the items.

644
00:27:56,850 --> 00:27:59,060
Finally.

645
00:27:58,400 --> 00:28:00,420
Phew.

646
00:28:00,760 --> 00:28:03,230
Third time paying today.

647
00:28:03,230 --> 00:28:05,630
Looking for the wallet.

648
00:28:06,960 --> 00:28:08,400
What's wrong?

649
00:28:08,770 --> 00:28:11,540
Huh, it was lost?

650
00:28:11,540 --> 00:28:14,870
Did you lose the money?

651
00:28:13,440 --> 00:28:14,870
That doesn't sound right.

652
00:28:14,870 --> 00:28:17,510
It has been lost.

653
00:28:16,140 --> 00:28:17,510
What about here?

654
00:28:18,240 --> 00:28:21,610
That's right. There's no money.

655
00:28:21,610 --> 00:28:22,610
Can it be?

656
00:28:22,610 --> 00:28:25,180
What should I do.

657
00:28:23,850 --> 00:28:26,020
That's right. What to do?

658
00:28:25,180 --> 00:28:26,980
She's in trouble.

659
00:28:27,420 --> 00:28:29,420
Can I touch you?

660
00:28:29,420 --> 00:28:32,020
It's not okay to not pay.

661
00:28:32,020 --> 00:28:34,760
Is there really no money? What about behind you?

662
00:28:34,760 --> 00:28:35,990
It's a pat down.

663
00:28:37,930 --> 00:28:40,330
Pat down in a supermarket!?

664
00:28:41,100 --> 00:28:43,230
Can you do without the items?

665
00:28:43,230 --> 00:28:45,470
That's not an option.

666
00:28:46,070 --> 00:28:48,000
Around that moment.

667
00:28:48,610 --> 00:28:50,610
She forgot her purse!

668
00:28:50,610 --> 00:28:51,440
Oh no.

669
00:28:51,440 --> 00:28:54,210
She forgot it at the shop.

670
00:28:54,210 --> 00:28:56,450
When she came back the second time...

671
00:28:56,450 --> 00:28:58,450
She left it there?

672
00:28:59,780 --> 00:29:02,650
Hey Yuna, can you go again?

673
00:29:02,650 --> 00:29:04,050
The wallet!

674
00:29:03,650 --> 00:29:05,990
The mother left it there.

675
00:29:04,050 --> 00:29:07,190
The culprit of the wallet mystery is the mother!

676
00:29:07,990 --> 00:29:11,360
The proprietress-to-be taking responsibility runs with all her might.

677
00:29:11,360 --> 00:29:13,400
That's how it's gotta be.

678
00:29:14,770 --> 00:29:16,700
Back again.

679
00:29:16,000 --> 00:29:17,530
She made it.

680
00:29:17,930 --> 00:29:18,700
Yunachan.

681
00:29:18,700 --> 00:29:23,110
I'm sorry. I forgot.

682
00:29:23,110 --> 00:29:24,340
I'm sorry.

683
00:29:24,340 --> 00:29:27,310
Please do it better, proprietress-to-be.

684
00:29:27,540 --> 00:29:29,710
She's so mad. So mad.

685
00:29:28,510 --> 00:29:30,680
With this she can finally pay.

686
00:29:30,880 --> 00:29:34,280
The little proprietress has purchased everything.

687
00:29:34,820 --> 00:29:37,620
I did it.

688
00:29:37,950 --> 00:29:41,320
I bought it all by myself.

689
00:29:39,420 --> 00:29:41,320
You did. Thank you.

690
00:29:41,320 --> 00:29:42,660
You really helped me out.

691
00:29:42,660 --> 00:29:46,000
Sorry for being a forgetful person.

692
00:29:46,330 --> 00:29:48,170
I'm home.

693
00:29:48,170 --> 00:29:49,600
Welcome back.

694
00:29:49,830 --> 00:29:53,770
Master, will this do?

695
00:29:53,770 --> 00:29:56,440
With these things I can make it all. Thank you.

696
00:29:56,440 --> 00:29:58,440
Thank you small proprietress.

697
00:29:58,580 --> 00:30:01,480
Both the proprietress and the great-proprietress are relieved.

698
00:30:01,780 --> 00:30:06,380
Using cucumbers, kamaboko and avocados for the raw fishless spread.

699
00:30:06,380 --> 00:30:10,720
And the homepa spreads with fish are also done.

700
00:30:11,520 --> 00:30:15,060
Since you did so well today Yuna I will

701
00:30:15,060 --> 00:30:17,090
make you the food you want to eat the most.

702
00:30:17,390 --> 00:30:19,230
I will make that sushi for you.

703
00:30:19,560 --> 00:30:23,630
How nice. Eating sushi at the counter.

704
00:30:23,970 --> 00:30:27,340
Uni, ikura, toro or eggs?

705
00:30:27,940 --> 00:30:29,610
Horse mackerel.

706
00:30:29,610 --> 00:30:30,770
How plain.

707
00:30:30,810 --> 00:30:31,810
How refined.

708
00:30:32,440 --> 00:30:35,980
The local mackerel around here is famous for its fattiness and flavor.

709
00:30:35,980 --> 00:30:38,620
It's the master's priceless ingredient.

710
00:30:37,020 --> 00:30:39,020
Looks yummy.

711
00:30:39,820 --> 00:30:44,020
This is a connoisseur's way of eating.

712
00:30:42,650 --> 00:30:44,920
How refined.

713
00:30:44,520 --> 00:30:46,160
How is it?

714
00:30:47,760 --> 00:30:51,460
I'm grateful to be the daughter of a sushi chef.

715
00:30:54,430 --> 00:30:55,800
Wonderful.

716
00:30:56,200 --> 00:30:59,840
What a tough errand.

717
00:30:57,730 --> 00:30:59,840
Really made me anxious.

718
00:30:59,840 --> 00:31:02,210
In the end even the mother went.

719
00:30:59,840 --> 00:31:02,500
I'm sorry.

720
00:30:59,840 --> 00:31:02,500
Jeez.

721
00:31:02,210 --> 00:31:06,080
It was really remarkable how verbal she was.

722
00:31:06,080 --> 00:31:07,610
Avocados. Avocados.

723
00:31:07,980 --> 00:31:10,320
I was amazed at how the mother said "You won't lose"

724
00:31:10,320 --> 00:31:16,490
cause it made her kid excited and really turned on a switch in her.

725
00:31:16,490 --> 00:31:18,360
Mr. Ebizou, to your children

726
00:31:18,360 --> 00:31:21,090
when you need to motivate them,
do you have a way to switch them on?

727
00:31:21,290 --> 00:31:23,330
No, I don't.

728
00:31:23,330 --> 00:31:27,200
If you motivate them then it will only work for 25 days.

729
00:31:23,400 --> 00:31:35,460
TN: Before his wife died of breast cancer they spent her last 25 days together with their kids at their home. He has blogged about those last 25 days.

730
00:31:27,200 --> 00:31:30,930
And if you keep doing it it eventually loses its effect.

731
00:31:30,930 --> 00:31:35,270
I do it only for those rare occasions.

732
00:31:30,970 --> 00:31:37,110
Kangen

733
00:31:35,670 --> 00:31:40,240
But it only works for about a week after opening day.

734
00:31:40,240 --> 00:31:42,410
It has to come from within.

735
00:31:42,410 --> 00:31:43,950
Shouldn't overshoot it.

736
00:31:43,950 --> 00:31:49,450
So you want him to also learn how to handle even the days that don't go well.

737
00:31:49,450 --> 00:31:53,360
I tell him that many people came to watch the play

738
00:31:53,360 --> 00:31:55,890
and if he does fail

739
00:31:55,890 --> 00:31:57,560
he will sense it himself.

740
00:31:57,560 --> 00:32:01,200
So on those days he will cry tears of disappointment.

741
00:32:01,200 --> 00:32:03,970
So he's really introspective about that.

742
00:32:04,230 --> 00:32:06,400
So I leave him be.

743
00:32:07,070 --> 00:32:09,910
It takes a lot of courage to self-reflect like that.

744
00:32:09,910 --> 00:32:11,680
Gotou when it comes to a motivation boost.

745
00:32:11,680 --> 00:32:15,280
I treat him with a movie and so on.

746
00:32:12,940 --> 00:32:15,280
As a reward?

747
00:32:15,280 --> 00:32:19,080
I will give him candy to encourge him.

748
00:32:19,080 --> 00:32:20,280
What about Mikitty?

749
00:32:20,280 --> 00:32:22,090
We do the opposite with

750
00:32:22,090 --> 00:32:24,450
The Lion King style.

751
00:32:24,450 --> 00:32:27,420
If my kid falls I say: Get back up!

752
00:32:28,290 --> 00:32:29,760
He's like that.

753
00:32:29,760 --> 00:32:32,160
When he says: "I don't want to go today."

754
00:32:32,160 --> 00:32:34,900
I will never allow it.

755
00:32:33,260 --> 00:32:34,900
What do you say during those times?

756
00:32:34,900 --> 00:32:39,300
By saying you won't go today does it mean you will never ever go again?

757
00:32:39,300 --> 00:32:42,110
Then he says: "Yes, I will go."
And he follows up on it.

758
00:32:42,110 --> 00:32:45,180
That's indeed how mothers are.

759
00:32:45,180 --> 00:32:48,550
They will say: "No good. Go right away."

760
00:32:48,550 --> 00:32:51,850
And when I am by their side and say: "I will give you candy."

761
00:32:51,850 --> 00:32:53,420
My wife says: "Oy!"

762
00:32:53,420 --> 00:32:55,920
That's so true. You really understand it.

763
00:32:56,350 --> 00:33:01,690
Later in this program: The Japanese Rugby team captain Tanaka's son will go on his first errand.

764
00:33:01,960 --> 00:33:05,930
Collagen.

765
00:33:02,960 --> 00:33:05,930
Collagen.

766
00:33:06,530 --> 00:33:09,370
Can he purchase collagen for his papa?

767
00:33:09,370 --> 00:33:12,600
Chicken thighs, please.

768
00:33:12,600 --> 00:33:14,440
Chicken thighs.

769
00:33:14,440 --> 00:33:18,640
Tanaka papa's breath is taken away all day.

770
00:33:19,580 --> 00:33:23,650
The Seto Inland Sea is full of delicious fish.

771
00:33:23,810 --> 00:33:27,720
Akashi sea bream in the harmony of Harima's open seas and oysters from Hiroshima.

772
00:33:29,090 --> 00:33:32,490
The second largest island in the Seto Inland Sea is Shoudo.

773
00:33:32,490 --> 00:33:36,360
Here there is a big fishmonger called Gyoden.

774
00:33:36,360 --> 00:33:39,000
It's almost like a fish market.

775
00:33:39,200 --> 00:33:42,630
Today they have Japanese amberjacks, blue crabs, rockfish and conger eel.

776
00:33:42,630 --> 00:33:44,800
Ah, the octupus is escaping.

777
00:33:43,700 --> 00:33:45,640
It fell out.

778
00:33:44,800 --> 00:33:46,500
Everything here is fresh.

779
00:33:47,640 --> 00:33:50,910
Every morning they bring the desired fish to the market

780
00:33:50,910 --> 00:33:54,210
and when they close the entire selection has been sold.

781
00:33:54,210 --> 00:33:58,780
They have such a passion for fish they take the trouble to get it.

782
00:33:58,780 --> 00:34:01,680
There's no one better than this master.

783
00:34:01,080 --> 00:34:02,950
What a nice smile.

784
00:34:02,990 --> 00:34:06,860
The big brother cherishes his little sister.

785
00:34:07,060 --> 00:34:11,430
Previously he would beg to be fed and clothed and being babied.

786
00:34:11,430 --> 00:34:19,570
But now his mother scolds him: "You are not a baby anymore. You are a big brother."

787
00:34:19,900 --> 00:34:23,010
The big brother should be able to go to the fishmonger by himself.

788
00:34:23,010 --> 00:34:26,110
Rintarou, can you go?

789
00:34:26,110 --> 00:34:27,680
By myself?

790
00:34:27,980 --> 00:34:29,510
Now way I can go.

791
00:34:29,510 --> 00:34:31,350
Didn't he become a big brother?

792
00:34:31,350 --> 00:34:34,950
It's impossible to go by myself.

793
00:34:33,320 --> 00:34:34,950
You said you could go.

794
00:34:34,950 --> 00:34:36,650
I absolutely can't go.

795
00:34:36,650 --> 00:34:38,420
A boy who can't go.

796
00:34:38,920 --> 00:34:42,260
You absolutely can.

797
00:34:40,160 --> 00:34:42,260
Because it's too embarrassing.

798
00:34:42,260 --> 00:34:44,290
The big brother is too shy?

799
00:34:44,290 --> 00:34:46,230
But Rintarou yesterday you...

800
00:34:46,960 --> 00:34:51,130
Since he became 4 he has started feeling really shy.

801
00:34:51,330 --> 00:34:52,700
You can't?

802
00:34:53,340 --> 00:34:55,410
That's right since you are baby, Rintarou.

803
00:34:55,540 --> 00:34:58,480
I'm not a baby.

804
00:34:58,480 --> 00:35:01,810
This spring he happily entered giraffe class in kindergarten.

805
00:35:01,810 --> 00:35:03,910
I'm not a baby anymore.

806
00:35:03,910 --> 00:35:08,790
I'm a big brother who can do things by myself and take care of my baby sister.

807
00:35:10,420 --> 00:35:12,960
You are not a baby?

808
00:35:11,320 --> 00:35:12,960
Yeah.

809
00:35:13,220 --> 00:35:16,990
What should we do about Chinatsu? She's hungry.

810
00:35:16,990 --> 00:35:21,460
Chinatsu is crying from hunger. What should we do?

811
00:35:22,330 --> 00:35:24,570
Alright, I will go.

812
00:35:23,670 --> 00:35:25,740
He's manning up.

813
00:35:24,570 --> 00:35:26,170
It went well.

814
00:35:30,240 --> 00:35:32,440
For his hungry little sister

815
00:35:32,440 --> 00:35:35,250
he's getting white fleshed fish at Gyoden

816
00:35:35,250 --> 00:35:39,020
grilling fish of the season and squid.

817
00:35:39,020 --> 00:35:41,680
Off you go. Do y' bes'.

818
00:35:41,680 --> 00:35:43,720
Do m' best'.

819
00:35:42,590 --> 00:35:44,220
He's going.

820
00:35:44,050 --> 00:35:47,390
Since he's no longer a baby he better do his best.

821
00:35:47,390 --> 00:35:50,830
It's tough being a big brother.

822
00:35:54,060 --> 00:35:57,370
Across the bridge it smells of soft rush reeds

823
00:35:57,370 --> 00:35:59,000
It's a tatami shop.

824
00:36:00,170 --> 00:36:02,640
Gyoden is down this road.

825
00:36:04,310 --> 00:36:05,910
The shop sign is within sight.

826
00:36:06,340 --> 00:36:08,280
He's already there.

827
00:36:08,610 --> 00:36:11,010
No way I can lose.

828
00:36:11,010 --> 00:36:14,880
He's getting fish of the season, squid and white-fleshed fish.

829
00:36:14,880 --> 00:36:19,560
For Chinatsu's first weaning meal, they will feed her white-fleshed fish.

830
00:36:19,560 --> 00:36:21,560
He has arrived at Gyoden.

831
00:36:21,560 --> 00:36:22,830
Good day.

832
00:36:23,190 --> 00:36:27,730
Squid and delicious fish please.

833
00:36:26,130 --> 00:36:27,730
Looking for delicious fish?

834
00:36:28,100 --> 00:36:30,630
It's true that fish of the season are delicious.

835
00:36:30,630 --> 00:36:32,740
What's good today?

836
00:36:32,740 --> 00:36:37,040
Did your mother say grilled or boiled?

837
00:36:39,040 --> 00:36:41,310
Grilled.

838
00:36:39,610 --> 00:36:41,310
She said grilled?

839
00:36:41,310 --> 00:36:43,780
The recommendation changes based on preparation.

840
00:36:43,780 --> 00:36:47,720
A fishmonger that even sells to high-end restaurants.

841
00:36:47,720 --> 00:36:50,490
What grilling fish do you recommend today?

842
00:36:50,850 --> 00:36:53,590
Do you want this one? A pink colored fish.

843
00:36:53,590 --> 00:36:54,520
Cherry anthias.

844
00:36:54,520 --> 00:36:56,860
This one is so cute.

845
00:36:56,960 --> 00:37:00,530
What is it called?

846
00:36:59,130 --> 00:37:00,530
It's a sea bream.

847
00:37:00,900 --> 00:37:03,270
Then you want this one?

848
00:37:02,030 --> 00:37:03,270
Yeah.

849
00:37:03,270 --> 00:37:05,540
And squid, please.

850
00:37:06,500 --> 00:37:09,940
It's a young squid. Meaty and with a sweetness.

851
00:37:10,340 --> 00:37:11,710
Anything else?

852
00:37:11,710 --> 00:37:14,040
And perhaps some tuna.

853
00:37:12,780 --> 00:37:14,040
Bluefin tuna?

854
00:37:14,040 --> 00:37:17,010
His beloved bluefin tuna is rarely available here.

855
00:37:17,010 --> 00:37:19,010
The store boasts mostly local seafood.

856
00:37:19,010 --> 00:37:22,920
He doesn't know about largehead hairtails.

857
00:37:21,750 --> 00:37:23,920
It's really beautiful.

858
00:37:23,190 --> 00:37:24,620
What about this shrimp?

859
00:37:24,620 --> 00:37:25,960
Still can't eat those.

860
00:37:25,960 --> 00:37:27,960
Since Chinatsu is still a baby.

861
00:37:28,120 --> 00:37:29,390
And what about this crab?

862
00:37:29,390 --> 00:37:30,430
Also can't eat crabs.

863
00:37:30,430 --> 00:37:34,500
He was told that they can't feed her crustaceans yet.

864
00:37:33,860 --> 00:37:35,930
He understands all that.

865
00:37:34,600 --> 00:37:36,670
Is it fine with these two?

866
00:37:36,670 --> 00:37:39,870
And white-fleshed fish too.

867
00:37:37,970 --> 00:37:39,870
Yes, for Chinatsu.

868
00:37:40,700 --> 00:37:47,240
Since the sea bream is already a white-fleshed fish he ponders his next choice.

869
00:37:47,810 --> 00:37:52,950
I'm looking for an even whiter fish.

870
00:37:50,350 --> 00:37:52,950
An even whiter fish?

871
00:37:52,420 --> 00:37:54,050
Makes sense to him.

872
00:37:52,950 --> 00:37:55,320
Even with her fish expertise the old lady is struggling.

873
00:37:55,420 --> 00:37:58,990
A white one with no colors.

874
00:37:58,990 --> 00:38:01,920
He's looking for one that is white.

875
00:38:01,920 --> 00:38:04,430
A fish without a color? This one.

876
00:38:04,430 --> 00:38:05,460
Red tonguesole.

877
00:38:05,460 --> 00:38:07,530
Like this?

878
00:38:07,530 --> 00:38:09,800
But there's color on its backside.

879
00:38:09,800 --> 00:38:12,570
This is no good.

880
00:38:11,130 --> 00:38:12,570
He's harsh.

881
00:38:12,570 --> 00:38:13,940
Nitpicky.

882
00:38:14,370 --> 00:38:16,040
Like this?

883
00:38:16,040 --> 00:38:18,310
But there's color on its backside.

884
00:38:18,310 --> 00:38:21,640
This is no good.

885
00:38:19,210 --> 00:38:21,640
It's still a white-fleshed fish, though.

886
00:38:21,640 --> 00:38:23,510
He's nitpicking.

887
00:38:22,680 --> 00:38:24,050
But it becomes white.

888
00:38:24,050 --> 00:38:28,650
You peel the skin off and it's white beneath.

889
00:38:28,650 --> 00:38:30,220
I see.

890
00:38:29,350 --> 00:38:31,690
Do you want me to make it white for you?

891
00:38:31,690 --> 00:38:34,220
Can she do that?

892
00:38:34,220 --> 00:38:35,930
Please wait.

893
00:38:35,990 --> 00:38:38,390
But Rintarou really wants to watch.

894
00:38:38,390 --> 00:38:40,390
He's curious how she can make it white.

895
00:38:40,390 --> 00:38:44,170
Since I'm in giraffe class I want to watch.

896
00:38:44,170 --> 00:38:46,170
A morbid curiousity.

897
00:38:47,000 --> 00:38:49,410
It will become white.

898
00:38:49,410 --> 00:38:51,140
It's his first time seeing it.

899
00:38:51,170 --> 00:38:52,810
Here I go.

900
00:38:52,810 --> 00:38:54,340
Removing the darkened skin.

901
00:38:54,340 --> 00:38:55,280
Heave ho.

902
00:38:55,280 --> 00:38:57,550
And it slips off.

903
00:38:57,550 --> 00:39:02,490
See, it become white. Isn't it good? It's white on both sides now.

904
00:38:57,780 --> 00:39:00,080
How pretty.

905
00:39:02,490 --> 00:39:04,350
But please cut off the blood.

906
00:39:04,990 --> 00:39:06,260
Cut off the blood?

907
00:39:05,920 --> 00:39:07,620
He's making demands.

908
00:39:07,620 --> 00:39:10,090
Will you do the next one Rintarou?

909
00:39:10,090 --> 00:39:11,690
The cute fish.

910
00:39:11,690 --> 00:39:13,500
That's right.

911
00:39:13,500 --> 00:39:15,800
She's filleting the grilling fish.

912
00:39:16,530 --> 00:39:19,840
Poor fish looks in pain.

913
00:39:17,900 --> 00:39:19,840
In pain?

914
00:39:19,840 --> 00:39:20,800
Are you scared?

915
00:39:20,800 --> 00:39:22,670
Not scared.

916
00:39:21,670 --> 00:39:22,670
I see.

917
00:39:22,840 --> 00:39:26,480
I will watch since Rintarou is in giraffe class.

918
00:39:26,480 --> 00:39:31,150
His pride from being in giraffe class has strengthened Rintarou who usually loves being babied.

919
00:39:31,250 --> 00:39:33,420
He's staring at it now.

920
00:39:34,820 --> 00:39:36,090
Should I split it?

921
00:39:36,790 --> 00:39:39,020
He wasn't ready for that.

922
00:39:38,150 --> 00:39:39,020
Shock!

923
00:39:39,020 --> 00:39:40,690
But giving it his all.

924
00:39:41,160 --> 00:39:44,330
Rintarou farted.

925
00:39:44,330 --> 00:39:45,930
You just made a toot?

926
00:39:45,530 --> 00:39:47,200
The best.

927
00:39:46,730 --> 00:39:47,530
It smells.

928
00:39:47,530 --> 00:39:49,870
It smells?

929
00:39:49,870 --> 00:39:51,730
I'm wet for some reason.

930
00:39:51,730 --> 00:39:54,440
Old lady...

931
00:39:52,640 --> 00:39:54,440
Having overcome his embarrassment

932
00:39:54,740 --> 00:39:56,570
he has succeeded with the errand.

933
00:39:56,570 --> 00:39:58,240
It's ready.

934
00:39:58,240 --> 00:40:00,710
Let's see how much it amounts to.

935
00:40:00,840 --> 00:40:02,850
Time to pay.

936
00:40:02,850 --> 00:40:03,780
I...

937
00:40:03,780 --> 00:40:05,980
have this dried fish.

938
00:40:04,380 --> 00:40:05,980
The master has been observing.

939
00:40:05,980 --> 00:40:09,690
Will you taste it?

940
00:40:06,920 --> 00:40:09,690
And wants to give him delicious curry as a reward.

941
00:40:09,690 --> 00:40:10,920
Curry. Do you dislike curry?

942
00:40:11,090 --> 00:40:12,720
I dislike curry.

943
00:40:12,720 --> 00:40:15,530
I'm sorry for this in your busy schedule, master.

944
00:40:14,660 --> 00:40:17,360
It was a nice offer, though.

945
00:40:16,490 --> 00:40:18,090
It's fine with only 2000 yen.

946
00:40:19,660 --> 00:40:22,270
2000 yen.

947
00:40:20,430 --> 00:40:22,270
He bought all this for 2000 yen?

948
00:40:22,270 --> 00:40:24,270
It has been greatly discounted by the master.

949
00:40:24,270 --> 00:40:25,970
Thank you.

950
00:40:27,100 --> 00:40:31,410
Take care. Please come again.

951
00:40:31,840 --> 00:40:33,880
Until next time.

952
00:40:35,280 --> 00:40:37,380
Thank you.

953
00:40:36,080 --> 00:40:37,380
Thank you.

954
00:40:37,380 --> 00:40:39,650
What a splendid shopping trip.

955
00:40:40,180 --> 00:40:43,650
The town of sun rays.

956
00:40:45,190 --> 00:40:49,960
I wonder if it will be sunny tomorrow.

957
00:40:49,960 --> 00:40:56,300
The paprika flowers are in bloom.

958
00:41:05,170 --> 00:41:06,940
His mood has changed.

959
00:41:06,940 --> 00:41:10,280
He crosses the bridge in a sunny mood.

960
00:41:10,510 --> 00:41:12,920
The anxious one is his mother.

961
00:41:12,920 --> 00:41:14,780
She keeps looking at the watch.

962
00:41:32,470 --> 00:41:34,470
Rintarou.

963
00:41:33,270 --> 00:41:34,470
It's his mothers voice.

964
00:41:34,470 --> 00:41:35,440
Where?

965
00:41:35,440 --> 00:41:37,570
Here. Above you.

966
00:41:38,110 --> 00:41:39,110
Did you go?

967
00:41:39,110 --> 00:41:40,340
I went.

968
00:41:40,340 --> 00:41:42,550
It's just a bit further.

969
00:41:47,620 --> 00:41:49,920
She looks delighted.

970
00:41:52,390 --> 00:41:58,130
The paprika flowers are in bloom.

971
00:41:58,560 --> 00:42:00,560
Please have a look at this face.

972
00:42:04,300 --> 00:42:07,140
Please look at his posture.

973
00:42:07,140 --> 00:42:10,240
He opens the doors with all his might.

974
00:42:10,470 --> 00:42:13,480
Welcome back. You went? Amazing.

975
00:42:13,680 --> 00:42:15,040
I went.

976
00:42:15,650 --> 00:42:18,280
Thank you for doing your best.

977
00:42:18,280 --> 00:42:20,080
Chinatsu is delighted.

978
00:42:20,080 --> 00:42:22,850
He did his best for Chinatsu.

979
00:42:23,190 --> 00:42:24,750
Boiling the red tonguesole

980
00:42:24,750 --> 00:42:28,260
grilling the seabream in soy sauce and serving the squid raw.

981
00:42:28,390 --> 00:42:29,660
Let's eat.

982
00:42:28,390 --> 00:42:31,950
Father

983
00:42:29,660 --> 00:42:33,360
Of course the Shoudo island-born father loves his fish.

984
00:42:33,700 --> 00:42:37,270
His first meal was also a white-fleshed fish.

985
00:42:37,730 --> 00:42:42,540
This is also Chinatsu's first taste of white fish.

986
00:42:38,940 --> 00:42:41,170
How nice.

987
00:42:42,710 --> 00:42:45,110
Your brother bought these.

988
00:42:46,110 --> 00:42:48,140
Now able to go on errands

989
00:42:48,140 --> 00:42:51,080
who is the big brother in the giraffe class.

990
00:42:51,410 --> 00:42:53,850
Surely it's Rintarou.

991
00:42:53,850 --> 00:42:56,250
What a magnificent big brother.

992
00:42:57,720 --> 00:42:59,920
Nice errand.

993
00:43:10,700 --> 00:43:13,570
Nice errand.

994
00:43:14,170 --> 00:43:18,070
Adults speak within a in-the-know context

995
00:43:18,070 --> 00:43:21,010
but white-fleshed fish isn't conveyed well.

996
00:43:21,010 --> 00:43:23,180
He heard it as simply white fish.

997
00:43:23,180 --> 00:43:27,250
In general, with small children - like with kamaboko earlier -

998
00:43:27,250 --> 00:43:31,750
a lot of them think that kamabo swims in the ocean like that paste.

999
00:43:31,750 --> 00:43:36,760
So he will try to avert his eyes as the sea bream is being cut

1000
00:43:36,760 --> 00:43:41,860
and while feeling sorry for its pain he will still look on.

1001
00:43:41,860 --> 00:43:43,200
I think that's really nice.

1002
00:43:43,200 --> 00:43:46,370
I have a big brother so I've often noticed that

1003
00:43:46,370 --> 00:43:49,410
a younger sister usually only sees their strong side.

1004
00:43:49,410 --> 00:43:55,510
Even when he was on his way home his attitude changed positively.

1005
00:43:55,510 --> 00:43:57,750
So to see the troubles of an older brother

1006
00:43:57,750 --> 00:43:58,950
really made me emotional.

1007
00:43:58,950 --> 00:44:03,690
Speaking of brothers... Amami.

1008
00:44:01,020 --> 00:44:03,690
Yes, it's true that I have both a big and a little brother.

1009
00:44:03,690 --> 00:44:08,190
I really thought about how the brother did his best.

1010
00:44:08,190 --> 00:44:12,230
We often went to the ocean near Toyama during the summer.

1011
00:44:12,230 --> 00:44:16,900
One time it poured down. And I was so cold.

1012
00:44:16,900 --> 00:44:18,730
I was so scared that I started crying.

1013
00:44:18,730 --> 00:44:20,900
We were both huddled under a bath towel.

1014
00:44:20,900 --> 00:44:22,840
and said "you can have it".

1015
00:44:21,940 --> 00:44:24,120
How gentle.

1016
00:44:22,840 --> 00:44:25,910
My older brother was surely cold too

1017
00:44:25,910 --> 00:44:28,910
and this segment made me think of that.

1018
00:44:28,910 --> 00:44:31,250
You are crying?

1019
00:44:29,710 --> 00:44:31,250
I'm sorry.

1020
00:44:31,250 --> 00:44:34,680
I'm moved by your lovely story.

1021
00:44:34,680 --> 00:44:38,220
You are not crying during a segment but during our talks in between!?

1022
00:44:38,220 --> 00:44:39,790
They sound so gentle.

1023
00:44:39,790 --> 00:44:43,030
I'm sorry.

1024
00:44:40,460 --> 00:44:43,030
I can't believe that this happened during our talks.

1025
00:44:43,030 --> 00:44:44,590
And for our next errand.

1026
00:44:44,590 --> 00:44:49,900
A thrifty boy on an adventure to man up for his beloved father.

1027
00:44:50,630 --> 00:44:58,240
In Aizu, the town of Kitakata which is homophonic with Northway and is famous for their Kitakata ramen.

1028
00:44:58,240 --> 00:45:00,110
With its doughy and voluminous noodles.

1029
00:45:00,110 --> 00:45:04,450
With its thick noodles covered in broth. It's the best!

1030
00:45:04,810 --> 00:45:09,520
When speaking of Kitakata ramen, the soup can vary from seafood broth to animal broth.

1031
00:45:09,520 --> 00:45:11,590
From light flavor to strong flavor.

1032
00:45:11,590 --> 00:45:14,360
In this town with a population of just under 50,000.

1033
00:45:14,360 --> 00:45:16,990
There are over 100 joints.

1034
00:45:17,230 --> 00:45:23,700
And this joint that's been operational for 36 years is run by a father who wants to put their child to an errand.

1035
00:45:23,700 --> 00:45:27,540
Who from Sendai has taken over the joint just recently.

1036
00:45:28,270 --> 00:45:33,880
This fighter who is wearing the same clothes as the owner is the 3 years and 9 months old Ao.

1037
00:45:33,080 --> 00:45:35,080
3 years?

1038
00:45:33,880 --> 00:45:39,780
But at home where the owner is simply papa Ao is treated sweetly.

1039
00:45:40,820 --> 00:45:44,120
But her mother has raised his older siblings with tough love.

1040
00:45:44,120 --> 00:45:47,320
But even she has a sweet spot for Ao.

1041
00:45:47,620 --> 00:45:51,460
Since he's the youngest and just about cute

1042
00:45:51,460 --> 00:45:55,730
I can't help but treat him with cuteness.

1043
00:45:55,730 --> 00:46:02,040
He's always looking at his brothers and sisters and is perfectly capable.

1044
00:46:02,040 --> 00:46:06,140
He helps out with various things even cooking. However....

1045
00:46:07,980 --> 00:46:10,780
He's still drinking milk from a bottle?

1046
00:46:11,280 --> 00:46:13,780
He likes it too much to stop.

1047
00:46:14,950 --> 00:46:19,920
Ao has looked up to his father since he became a restaurant owner.

1048
00:46:19,920 --> 00:46:22,930
He wants to be cool like his father and work.

1049
00:46:23,730 --> 00:46:26,330
Their home is just behind the joint.

1050
00:46:27,530 --> 00:46:30,900
Ao, it's time for you to put on your work clothes.

1051
00:46:31,430 --> 00:46:34,770
Getting dressed for work.

1052
00:46:34,770 --> 00:46:37,240
Cool.

1053
00:46:37,810 --> 00:46:41,440
Look at the face. He's ready for work.

1054
00:46:42,280 --> 00:46:46,080
Remember when we talked about what type of ramen kids would like?

1055
00:46:46,080 --> 00:46:48,320
They discussed it yesterday with the owner

1056
00:46:48,320 --> 00:46:50,450
to change the children's ramen

1057
00:46:50,450 --> 00:46:52,620
They brainstormed on paper.

1058
00:46:52,620 --> 00:46:55,220
They would need some petit noodles.

1059
00:46:55,220 --> 00:47:00,000
Currently the freebie is some candy but what if they change it to toys?

1060
00:46:57,790 --> 00:47:00,000
- Kamen Rider toy
- Stickers

1061
00:47:00,200 --> 00:47:02,000
Would be lovely with toys.

1062
00:47:02,000 --> 00:47:03,870
They will adopt Ao's idea.

1063
00:47:03,870 --> 00:47:06,900
Papa said that it would be nice with a gachapon.

1064
00:47:03,870 --> 00:47:13,340
Gachapon: Capsule-toy from a vending machine.

1065
00:47:07,070 --> 00:47:10,040
He is usually told not to get gachapon by himself

1066
00:47:10,040 --> 00:47:13,340
but this time it will be his errand.

1067
00:47:13,340 --> 00:47:16,450
We want an Anpanman gachapon.

1068
00:47:16,450 --> 00:47:19,880
Eh? Not getting a Kamen Rider toy?

1069
00:47:19,880 --> 00:47:24,150
But only boys will be happy with a Kamen Rider toy, right?

1070
00:47:24,150 --> 00:47:26,820
I see, equal rights.

1071
00:47:26,820 --> 00:47:29,690
I'm asking you, okay?

1072
00:47:27,720 --> 00:47:29,690
A gachapon errand.

1073
00:47:30,030 --> 00:47:32,630
But you need them for your experiment.

1074
00:47:32,630 --> 00:47:36,070
First he will bring an apron to his father's work place.

1075
00:47:36,070 --> 00:47:38,000
Experiment for three.

1076
00:47:38,000 --> 00:47:40,770
The petit noodles is at the noodle maker.

1077
00:47:40,770 --> 00:47:46,140
He was asked to get gachapon from the supermarket and Anpanman kamaboko and milk.

1078
00:47:45,770 --> 00:47:48,110
He's only 3 years old.

1079
00:47:47,210 --> 00:47:50,810
Since they need 3 toys he can do it thrice today.

1080
00:47:52,210 --> 00:47:56,190
Remember to loudly proclaim
"Thank you for your hard work, owner".

1081
00:47:54,620 --> 00:47:56,190
Yep.

1082
00:47:56,190 --> 00:47:59,020
Because his father is the owner when he's working.

1083
00:47:59,020 --> 00:48:01,260
Off you go.

1084
00:48:00,020 --> 00:48:01,260
I got it.

1085
00:48:12,600 --> 00:48:16,210
Today he's on an errand so he enters through the backdoor.

1086
00:48:16,370 --> 00:48:20,440
He's always told the he can't just enter the store to play around.

1087
00:48:21,580 --> 00:48:25,750
But today, he's wearing his work apron so he's free to enter.

1088
00:48:29,850 --> 00:48:31,390
Welcome. Order up!

1089
00:48:31,390 --> 00:48:33,420
The loud voice of his father.

1090
00:48:33,420 --> 00:48:35,260
The shop is full of customers.

1091
00:48:35,260 --> 00:48:37,990
The clanging of utensils.

1092
00:48:38,490 --> 00:48:40,530
Thank you for your hard work.

1093
00:48:40,700 --> 00:48:42,770
He's nervous.

1094
00:48:42,770 --> 00:48:44,770
Here is his fathers' apron.

1095
00:48:45,070 --> 00:48:46,770
Ao, thank you.

1096
00:48:46,770 --> 00:48:49,510
His father makes sure he knows what to get.

1097
00:48:49,770 --> 00:48:52,010
Ao.

1098
00:48:52,210 --> 00:48:53,780
You are going shopping, right?

1099
00:48:53,780 --> 00:48:54,410
Yep.

1100
00:48:54,410 --> 00:48:58,280
Do you know what you are getting?

1101
00:48:58,280 --> 00:48:59,780
Gachapon.

1102
00:48:59,780 --> 00:49:03,120
As expected his head is full of toys.

1103
00:49:03,890 --> 00:49:05,720
3 petit noodles.

1104
00:49:06,020 --> 00:49:07,590
It's petit noodles.

1105
00:49:07,590 --> 00:49:11,330
These short noodles are ideal for children.

1106
00:49:11,630 --> 00:49:12,900
Okay?

1107
00:49:12,900 --> 00:49:14,460
I'm asking you.

1108
00:49:14,460 --> 00:49:16,530
Will he be fine?

1109
00:49:17,100 --> 00:49:20,940
Yes, you can exit through here.

1110
00:49:18,300 --> 00:49:20,940
Feels like he's only heading for the toys.

1111
00:49:22,240 --> 00:49:25,570
Things already look suspicious.

1112
00:49:28,410 --> 00:49:30,680
Did he become homesick?

1113
00:49:30,410 --> 00:49:34,550
As if stuck to the ground his feet stopped moving.

1114
00:49:34,550 --> 00:49:36,550
What's wrong?

1115
00:49:36,850 --> 00:49:39,960
He's not moving a bit in front of the joint.

1116
00:49:41,890 --> 00:49:45,230
That's expected from a 3 year old.

1117
00:49:43,630 --> 00:49:48,200
The joint is blocking the view to his house.

1118
00:49:49,570 --> 00:49:52,400
I wonder if he's still over there.

1119
00:49:52,840 --> 00:49:55,440
His father can see him.

1120
00:49:56,140 --> 00:49:59,210
He's been looking on for 20 minutes.

1121
00:50:00,540 --> 00:50:02,310
Ao, what's wrong?

1122
00:50:02,310 --> 00:50:05,650
Aren't you going shopping?

1123
00:50:09,920 --> 00:50:11,550
Ao, you are a boy, right?

1124
00:50:11,550 --> 00:50:14,890
This is Ao who wants to be a man like his father.

1125
00:50:14,890 --> 00:50:16,790
You will go, right?

1126
00:50:17,130 --> 00:50:19,190
You can't just keep standing here.

1127
00:50:19,190 --> 00:50:22,630
The father, told him once again.

1128
00:50:22,630 --> 00:50:24,730
Since you are a boy...

1129
00:50:24,730 --> 00:50:26,970
Dad's gonna cry too!

1130
00:50:28,100 --> 00:50:31,570
Can you go and do your best?

1131
00:50:29,070 --> 00:50:31,570
Um.

1132
00:50:31,740 --> 00:50:33,210
Please do your best.

1133
00:50:34,040 --> 00:50:36,210
I will be watching from here.

1134
00:50:35,080 --> 00:50:36,210
Um.

1135
00:50:36,680 --> 00:50:38,750
Do your best. Go on.

1136
00:50:39,520 --> 00:50:42,950
He's told to do his best not as an instruction

1137
00:50:42,950 --> 00:50:44,950
but as his fathers prayer.

1138
00:50:44,950 --> 00:50:48,720
A prayer to make Ao strong and go forth.

1139
00:50:54,400 --> 00:50:57,400
It's green. You can go. Raise your hand.

1140
00:50:57,870 --> 00:50:59,270
Go. Hurry up and go.

1141
00:50:59,570 --> 00:51:01,940
Do your best Ao.

1142
00:51:03,370 --> 00:51:08,140
He did it! He crossed the street.

1143
00:51:06,180 --> 00:51:08,240
His mother was also worried.

1144
00:51:08,580 --> 00:51:11,210
Ao, do your best!

1145
00:51:11,710 --> 00:51:16,250
Seems like his fathers and mothers prayers have come true.

1146
00:51:22,460 --> 00:51:27,000
Since they are making three meals he needs to get three toys and more.

1147
00:51:27,730 --> 00:51:30,100
On this street to the left is

1148
00:51:30,100 --> 00:51:33,100
the big supermarket with the toys.

1149
00:51:34,800 --> 00:51:37,340
Wait!? He's crossing the street?

1150
00:51:37,340 --> 00:51:40,440
Which means he's not getting the gachapon but...

1151
00:51:40,440 --> 00:51:43,050
he's heading for the noodle maker.

1152
00:51:44,050 --> 00:51:47,980
Look at this face. He's not playing around.

1153
00:51:49,020 --> 00:51:51,090
He's making a serious face.

1154
00:51:59,160 --> 00:52:03,000
The noodles he needs to get are shorter so that kids can easily eat them.

1155
00:52:03,000 --> 00:52:07,570
This place is where they get all of their noodles.

1156
00:52:07,570 --> 00:52:11,710
They have started allowing regular customers to purchase items here.

1157
00:52:12,040 --> 00:52:14,580
They make the noodles inside.

1158
00:52:14,580 --> 00:52:17,510
Good day. Welcome.

1159
00:52:17,510 --> 00:52:18,650
Good day.

1160
00:52:18,650 --> 00:52:21,080
Did you come by yourself? Are you on an errand?

1161
00:52:21,080 --> 00:52:23,190
He's been giving it his all so far but...

1162
00:52:23,720 --> 00:52:25,520
What can I do for you?

1163
00:52:26,390 --> 00:52:28,620
He doesn't know what to say.

1164
00:52:28,620 --> 00:52:30,620
Please tell me.

1165
00:52:32,330 --> 00:52:34,530
What is it? Did you forget?

1166
00:52:32,960 --> 00:52:34,460
Do your best.

1167
00:52:34,530 --> 00:52:37,370
Huh!? What was it again?

1168
00:52:37,370 --> 00:52:38,830
Three petit noodles, right?

1169
00:52:39,030 --> 00:52:40,770
Please have a seat.

1170
00:52:40,870 --> 00:52:42,240
Do you want some water?

1171
00:52:42,240 --> 00:52:44,240
Maybe he will remember after a drink.

1172
00:52:44,240 --> 00:52:46,240
Do your best.

1173
00:52:47,580 --> 00:52:50,780
What have you been told to purchase?

1174
00:52:53,080 --> 00:52:55,080
Thick noodles.

1175
00:52:54,150 --> 00:52:55,080
Thick noodles?

1176
00:52:54,380 --> 00:52:56,390
Thick noodles?

1177
00:52:55,080 --> 00:52:58,790
He realizes immediately that it's not right.

1178
00:52:57,890 --> 00:52:58,790
I see.

1179
00:52:58,790 --> 00:53:01,060
Thick noodles.

1180
00:52:59,590 --> 00:53:01,060
Thick noodles?

1181
00:53:01,060 --> 00:53:02,860
Did your mama say thick noodles?

1182
00:53:02,860 --> 00:53:04,660
Petit noodles and thick noodles.

1183
00:53:04,660 --> 00:53:06,960
It's not easy to differentiate for beginners.

1184
00:53:06,960 --> 00:53:09,900
Surely the owner can work with these.

1185
00:53:10,200 --> 00:53:12,170
Thank you very much.

1186
00:53:12,170 --> 00:53:14,770
He was not able to let out his voice inside

1187
00:53:14,770 --> 00:53:17,810
but he knows what to say when leaving.

1188
00:53:18,440 --> 00:53:20,910
Thank you.

1189
00:53:20,910 --> 00:53:23,480
He has more confidence now that he has the noodles.

1190
00:53:27,920 --> 00:53:30,590
Yaay.

1191
00:53:28,720 --> 00:53:30,590
His mood is improving.

1192
00:53:30,590 --> 00:53:32,820
Yaay.

1193
00:53:32,820 --> 00:53:34,690
Yayay.

1194
00:53:34,690 --> 00:53:37,260
Maybe his mood is too over the top now.

1195
00:53:38,130 --> 00:53:42,160
The gachapon is that way.

1196
00:53:42,360 --> 00:53:46,130
My mama said to get gachapon.

1197
00:53:46,130 --> 00:53:49,540
Three. You should only get three.

1198
00:53:50,370 --> 00:53:52,070
If he gets a Kamen Rider gachapon...

1199
00:53:54,810 --> 00:53:59,950
He's usually told he can't but today he's told to get some.

1200
00:53:59,950 --> 00:54:02,320
You rarely hear something this delicious.

1201
00:54:03,250 --> 00:54:04,420
There's also this.

1202
00:54:04,590 --> 00:54:05,690
Kamen Rider.

1203
00:54:05,690 --> 00:54:10,030
He wants to get the Kamen Rider but he's holding it in.

1204
00:54:10,030 --> 00:54:11,330
Today it's this one.

1205
00:54:11,330 --> 00:54:12,430
That's right.

1206
00:54:12,430 --> 00:54:14,960
Even girls would be delighted by Anpanman.

1207
00:54:14,960 --> 00:54:17,600
But it's only 3.

1208
00:54:17,830 --> 00:54:19,840
This is the first one.

1209
00:54:21,270 --> 00:54:22,670
One came out.

1210
00:54:22,670 --> 00:54:24,870
Two more to go, right?

1211
00:54:30,650 --> 00:54:32,510
Can I?

1212
00:54:32,510 --> 00:54:34,150
What's wrong?

1213
00:54:34,150 --> 00:54:35,550
He's hesitating.

1214
00:54:35,880 --> 00:54:37,820
But...

1215
00:54:37,350 --> 00:54:38,890
"But?"

1216
00:54:38,620 --> 00:54:41,090
Since when I

1217
00:54:41,090 --> 00:54:44,890
do it multiple times mama scolds me.

1218
00:54:45,160 --> 00:54:47,060
Hit a wall.

1219
00:54:45,890 --> 00:54:49,260
But it's different today since you were asked to.

1220
00:54:50,670 --> 00:54:54,940
He's afraid that he will be scolded if he does it a second time but he does it again.

1221
00:54:54,940 --> 00:54:57,410
Since today is an errand.

1222
00:54:57,410 --> 00:54:59,240
Needs three.

1223
00:55:01,180 --> 00:55:05,010
It's fine. He was asked to get three so one more to go.

1224
00:55:08,350 --> 00:55:10,720
I better not do it.

1225
00:55:10,720 --> 00:55:15,360
Even though he was asked to get three he could only do it twice.

1226
00:55:15,360 --> 00:55:16,930
He's terrified.

1227
00:55:16,930 --> 00:55:19,630
Next up is the milk.

1228
00:55:19,630 --> 00:55:23,600
He needs to get milk but he doesn't know where to find it.

1229
00:55:23,600 --> 00:55:26,470
The easiest way is to ask the shop attendant.

1230
00:55:27,840 --> 00:55:30,010
Welcome.

1231
00:55:30,010 --> 00:55:32,010
Are you looking for something?

1232
00:55:31,240 --> 00:55:32,010
Yeah.

1233
00:55:32,010 --> 00:55:33,110
What are you looking for?

1234
00:55:33,110 --> 00:55:35,110
Milk.

1235
00:55:33,780 --> 00:55:35,110
He was able to ask.

1236
00:55:34,680 --> 00:55:35,960
Remarkable.

1237
00:55:36,010 --> 00:55:38,480
The old lady is taking him there.

1238
00:55:38,480 --> 00:55:40,620
What type of milk? Big? Small?

1239
00:55:39,480 --> 00:55:40,620
Yes, a small one.

1240
00:55:40,620 --> 00:55:42,580
The big one.

1241
00:55:41,550 --> 00:55:42,580
A big one?

1242
00:55:42,850 --> 00:55:46,020
He wants to drink a lot so he's getting the big one.

1243
00:55:46,020 --> 00:55:48,260
But it's definitely heavy.

1244
00:55:48,260 --> 00:55:50,390
What else do you want to get?

1245
00:55:49,930 --> 00:55:50,390
Erm...

1246
00:55:50,390 --> 00:55:53,800
He was also asked to get Anpanman kamaboko.

1247
00:55:53,800 --> 00:55:56,100
Ah! It's right here.

1248
00:55:56,100 --> 00:55:58,970
Oh no, they passed it.

1249
00:55:59,130 --> 00:56:00,970
What did you purchase previously?

1250
00:56:00,970 --> 00:56:03,070
This is ramen.

1251
00:56:03,140 --> 00:56:05,970
Isn't it ramen?

1252
00:56:06,610 --> 00:56:10,210
That's what I said.

1253
00:56:08,580 --> 00:56:10,210
What do you plan to put in the ramen?

1254
00:56:10,210 --> 00:56:12,450
What goes well with ramen?

1255
00:56:12,450 --> 00:56:15,950
We have a lot already.

1256
00:56:14,650 --> 00:56:15,950
You have a lot of naruto?

1257
00:56:15,760 --> 00:56:22,020
Both naruto and imitation crab are types of kamaboko (steamed fish paste).

1258
00:56:15,950 --> 00:56:17,720
Since it's a ramen joint.

1259
00:56:17,720 --> 00:56:19,140
What about this?

1260
00:56:19,120 --> 00:56:20,220
Imitation crab.

1261
00:56:20,220 --> 00:56:24,530
I'm not sure about putting this in ramen.

1262
00:56:22,920 --> 00:56:24,530
He loves imitation crab.

1263
00:56:24,590 --> 00:56:25,730
You want to put it in?

1264
00:56:25,130 --> 00:56:25,730
Yeah.

1265
00:56:25,530 --> 00:56:27,700
That's original.

1266
00:56:26,860 --> 00:56:31,400
You have two types of gachapon.
Is this for playing around?

1267
00:56:31,400 --> 00:56:35,300
This is for the children's ramen...

1268
00:56:35,970 --> 00:56:37,140
Got it.

1269
00:56:37,140 --> 00:56:41,540
It's a freebie for the children's ramen set?

1270
00:56:40,080 --> 00:56:41,610
Amazing.

1271
00:56:40,440 --> 00:56:41,540
Yep.

1272
00:56:41,540 --> 00:56:44,080
I got it?

1273
00:56:42,080 --> 00:56:44,080
The old lady is sharp.

1274
00:56:44,080 --> 00:56:45,110
A ramen joint?

1275
00:56:45,110 --> 00:56:46,950
The name of the store is written.

1276
00:56:46,950 --> 00:56:49,820
Oh, the Raiyuu ramen joint.

1277
00:56:49,820 --> 00:56:51,920
Why didn't you say so? I always go there to eat.

1278
00:56:51,920 --> 00:56:53,660
It's delicious.

1279
00:56:52,550 --> 00:56:53,660
She's a regular.

1280
00:56:53,760 --> 00:56:57,060
Papa is doing great.

1281
00:56:57,060 --> 00:57:00,060
He's making delicious ramen.

1282
00:56:58,460 --> 00:57:00,060
He is, isn't he?

1283
00:57:00,230 --> 00:57:03,830
He's been observing his fathers ramen making.

1284
00:57:03,830 --> 00:57:08,270
The work of the second generation owner. Proud of his cool dad.

1285
00:57:11,610 --> 00:57:13,580
Carrying...

1286
00:57:13,580 --> 00:57:17,580
A heave and a ho.

1287
00:57:17,680 --> 00:57:19,880
It's heavy but

1288
00:57:20,220 --> 00:57:22,480
It's heavy but he's carrying it.

1289
00:57:23,490 --> 00:57:24,690
Can't hold it.

1290
00:57:24,690 --> 00:57:26,660
He can't hold it but he is carrying it.

1291
00:57:26,660 --> 00:57:29,660
Feels like I can't carry it.

1292
00:57:28,720 --> 00:57:30,730
Feels like he can't carry it?

1293
00:57:31,360 --> 00:57:35,360
What should I do.

1294
00:57:35,430 --> 00:57:38,230
While he complains he does have spirit.

1295
00:57:38,230 --> 00:57:41,170
It's heavy and I'm exhausted.

1296
00:57:41,170 --> 00:57:44,340
You're not reckless you are clever.

1297
00:57:44,340 --> 00:57:47,780
Break time. Break time.

1298
00:57:50,280 --> 00:57:51,650
Ah.

1299
00:57:51,650 --> 00:57:55,020
Mama said that I should

1300
00:57:55,020 --> 00:57:57,150
put it in the bag.

1301
00:57:57,150 --> 00:57:58,990
In here.

1302
00:57:58,990 --> 00:58:03,120
I see. He remembered what his mother said.

1303
00:58:03,560 --> 00:58:06,090
I want him to hurry home.

1304
00:58:06,390 --> 00:58:11,000
I know not to peek but I can't help myself.

1305
00:58:09,660 --> 00:58:11,000
Do your best.

1306
00:58:11,130 --> 00:58:14,270
The thoughts of a parent who can only pray.

1307
00:58:15,940 --> 00:58:18,910
Kamen Rider.

1308
00:58:17,140 --> 00:58:19,980
After putting it in the bag both his hands are free to.

1309
00:58:21,340 --> 00:58:22,980
Hurry.

1310
00:58:22,980 --> 00:58:25,210
He feels lighter now.

1311
00:58:35,460 --> 00:58:37,190
I'm exhausted.

1312
00:58:37,230 --> 00:58:41,460
I will rest at home. I'm exhausted.

1313
00:58:42,400 --> 00:58:44,330
Welcome home.

1314
00:58:44,330 --> 00:58:46,700
He will inform his mother first.

1315
00:58:48,900 --> 00:58:50,440
How was it?

1316
00:58:52,410 --> 00:58:54,340
Come here.

1317
00:58:55,110 --> 00:58:57,780
It was heavy, right? Mama will help you out.

1318
00:58:57,780 --> 00:59:00,820
You helped. You truly helped out.

1319
00:59:00,820 --> 00:59:02,950
He better take it to the owner.

1320
00:59:02,950 --> 00:59:06,050
This time he's making a grand entrance.

1321
00:59:06,050 --> 00:59:08,050
This face.

1322
00:59:10,460 --> 00:59:13,660
Papa, ramen.

1323
00:59:12,490 --> 00:59:13,660
Did you buy it?

1324
00:59:14,530 --> 00:59:15,660
You bought some?

1325
00:59:15,660 --> 00:59:18,200
This is not the Anpanman kamaboko

1326
00:59:18,200 --> 00:59:21,100
but it's fine.

1327
00:59:19,470 --> 00:59:21,100
He will work it out.

1328
00:59:21,100 --> 00:59:23,940
You helped out. Thank you very much.

1329
00:59:24,310 --> 00:59:29,780
Since he bought thick noodles he made the soup a bit thicker to match.

1330
00:59:29,780 --> 00:59:32,080
With imitation crab that kids love.

1331
00:59:32,080 --> 00:59:34,520
Might be cuter this way.

1332
00:59:35,180 --> 00:59:38,250
Valuing the opinion of children.

1333
00:59:38,750 --> 00:59:40,590
Are you satisfied with this?

1334
00:59:40,590 --> 00:59:41,860
Okay okay.

1335
00:59:41,860 --> 00:59:44,730
It's an okay if Ao says it's okay.

1336
00:59:44,730 --> 00:59:49,430
It's a children's ramen who will excitedly anticipate what type of toy is inside.

1337
00:59:49,430 --> 00:59:50,730
What you bought I...

1338
00:59:50,730 --> 00:59:55,070
He will take a big gulp today especially since he bought the big one.

1339
00:59:52,200 --> 00:59:55,070
He can hardly lift it.

1340
00:59:56,910 --> 01:00:01,710
Today will be his last day with the baby bottle.

1341
01:00:01,710 --> 01:00:04,850
How cool.

1342
01:00:03,240 --> 01:00:04,850
He does look cool.

1343
01:00:12,320 --> 01:00:17,560
The hesitant way he was holding the 100 yen coin.

1344
01:00:15,120 --> 01:00:17,560
Afraid to put it in.

1345
01:00:17,560 --> 01:00:23,400
The fact that he was standing in front of the joint for 20 minutes. Made me teary-eyed.

1346
01:00:23,400 --> 01:00:28,270
It made me reflect on my own memories and brought back a lot of things.

1347
01:00:28,270 --> 01:00:31,910
When boys are able to clear just a single task

1348
01:00:31,910 --> 01:00:34,780
and immediately celebrating it

1349
01:00:34,780 --> 01:00:36,910
that's such an endearing part about boys.

1350
01:00:36,910 --> 01:00:38,650
Despite his maturing

1351
01:00:38,650 --> 01:00:42,580
to celebrate it with milk from the baby bottle.

1352
01:00:42,580 --> 01:00:47,020
It was kinda cool. He just can't stop.

1353
01:00:43,990 --> 01:00:45,490
Wasn't that just cool?

1354
01:00:45,490 --> 01:00:46,590
A contradiction.

1355
01:00:46,590 --> 01:00:49,090
Even though he shouldn't do it.

1356
01:00:49,790 --> 01:00:55,060
The next errand is with a girl but the premise is a sibling fight.

1357
01:00:55,620 --> 01:01:01,230
Fukushima ● Yamato city

1358
01:00:57,700 --> 01:01:02,000
The C57 still runs in the northern part of Fukushima.

1359
01:01:02,000 --> 01:01:05,670
The house is near where the steam whistle can be heard.

1360
01:01:05,740 --> 01:01:10,680
4 years 8 months

1361
01:01:05,740 --> 01:01:10,680
Big
brother

1362
01:01:05,740 --> 01:01:10,680
Big sister

1363
01:01:05,740 --> 01:01:10,680
Karin

1364
01:01:06,210 --> 01:01:09,840
Karin is the last child among the three friendly siblings.

1365
01:01:09,840 --> 01:01:15,150
2 weeks ago she ripped her big sisters playing cards which resulted in a huge fight.

1366
01:01:15,150 --> 01:01:17,750
She knew that she had done bad

1367
01:01:17,750 --> 01:01:23,530
So she said that: "Karin will buy new cards with her own savings."

1368
01:01:23,530 --> 01:01:28,600
When she is determined to go she will go. I asked her where do you want to go

1369
01:01:28,600 --> 01:01:31,580
and she said: "Icchan's cards."

1370
01:01:31,700 --> 01:01:34,200
When asked who was bad she said: "Karin".

1371
01:01:34,500 --> 01:01:37,610
While her sister was playing Sevens

1372
01:01:37,610 --> 01:01:41,510
Karin begged to get to play along

1373
01:01:41,510 --> 01:01:46,280
She was told no cause they were in the middle of a game.

1374
01:01:46,280 --> 01:01:49,920
She got mad and ripped a card.

1375
01:01:51,250 --> 01:01:55,990
No matter how much she apologized her sister did not forgive her.

1376
01:01:55,990 --> 01:01:57,060
I feel sorry for her.

1377
01:01:57,060 --> 01:02:01,230
This is the reason for the big fight.

1378
01:02:02,000 --> 01:02:04,630
They tried to fix it with tape.

1379
01:02:04,630 --> 01:02:07,200
She said: "I will never forgive you."

1380
01:02:07,500 --> 01:02:11,570
This is the first time she's gotten this mad towards Karin.

1381
01:02:11,910 --> 01:02:14,440
She wants to go back to before she ripped the card.

1382
01:02:14,440 --> 01:02:19,380
"I see. I could buy new cards with my savings."

1383
01:02:19,380 --> 01:02:21,720
That's what Karin thought of.

1384
01:02:22,020 --> 01:02:24,320
You only have two 1 yen coins.

1385
01:02:25,790 --> 01:02:28,320
She only has 2 yen?

1386
01:02:25,990 --> 01:02:28,790
Ka~rin-chan!

1387
01:02:28,620 --> 01:02:30,230
Please lend me some money.

1388
01:02:30,230 --> 01:02:32,190
So you will repay me?

1389
01:02:32,190 --> 01:02:34,030
When you grow up?

1390
01:02:32,930 --> 01:02:34,030
She will borrow.

1391
01:02:34,230 --> 01:02:38,200
With five 100 yen coins you can buy one pack of cards.

1392
01:02:38,200 --> 01:02:40,600
One pack of cards for 500 yen.

1393
01:02:40,600 --> 01:02:43,270
The mother looked into it.

1394
01:02:44,270 --> 01:02:47,780
Definitely wear your hood.

1395
01:02:45,840 --> 01:02:47,780
It has started raining a bit.

1396
01:02:48,010 --> 01:02:50,980
If I don't hurry they will sell out.

1397
01:02:51,410 --> 01:02:54,050
Make sure to wear your hood.

1398
01:02:55,720 --> 01:02:59,550
If you ever feel lonely then hug this charm tightly.

1399
01:02:59,690 --> 01:03:02,960
Mama made this to protect you, Karin.

1400
01:03:02,960 --> 01:03:05,230
The mom has made preparations

1401
01:03:05,230 --> 01:03:06,690
A charm with a microphone inside.

1402
01:03:06,690 --> 01:03:08,160
A good luck charm.

1403
01:03:08,430 --> 01:03:10,430
Her first time going shopping alone.

1404
01:03:10,430 --> 01:03:12,000
Be careful of cars.

1405
01:03:13,840 --> 01:03:18,040
What's wrong? Wasn't she the one who wanted to go alone?

1406
01:03:16,810 --> 01:03:18,940
She doesn't want to go anymore.

1407
01:03:20,740 --> 01:03:24,910
Why are you crying?

1408
01:03:24,910 --> 01:03:25,880
What's wrong?

1409
01:03:26,580 --> 01:03:27,680
Are you anxious?

1410
01:03:27,680 --> 01:03:31,390
She noticed how lonely it will be to go alone.

1411
01:03:31,750 --> 01:03:33,220
You want to be forgiven, right?

1412
01:03:33,220 --> 01:03:34,860
At that moment...

1413
01:03:35,390 --> 01:03:36,860
The whistle is blowing.

1414
01:03:37,590 --> 01:03:39,230
Her expression changed.

1415
01:03:41,460 --> 01:03:44,500
The power of the C57's whistle.

1416
01:03:44,500 --> 01:03:47,140
Which made Karin determined.

1417
01:03:47,300 --> 01:03:50,370
Please depart with the steam locomotive. You want to be forgiven, right?

1418
01:03:50,370 --> 01:03:51,840
Alright.

1419
01:03:51,840 --> 01:03:52,670
I will go.

1420
01:03:52,670 --> 01:03:54,140
Off you go.

1421
01:03:54,580 --> 01:03:56,340
She will go and purchase cards.

1422
01:03:56,340 --> 01:03:59,280
And she's also getting her sisters favorite cake.

1423
01:03:59,280 --> 01:04:01,350
Her mother gave her money for that.

1424
01:04:01,350 --> 01:04:07,160
On the way back she's also getting soba. Her sister will surely be delighted.

1425
01:04:06,750 --> 01:04:08,220
Tough.

1426
01:04:07,290 --> 01:04:10,360
Off I go.

1427
01:04:08,360 --> 01:04:10,360
Off you go.

1428
01:04:10,690 --> 01:04:12,890
Be careful of the cars.

1429
01:04:12,030 --> 01:04:12,890
I will.

1430
01:04:12,890 --> 01:04:14,830
Off you go.

1431
01:04:13,560 --> 01:04:14,830
Off I go.

1432
01:04:14,230 --> 01:04:15,630
She's going.

1433
01:04:14,830 --> 01:04:16,630
I better go shopping.

1434
01:04:16,630 --> 01:04:20,440
She's going on her first errand with this sense of duty.

1435
01:04:20,440 --> 01:04:25,910
Her mother truly believes that Karin is carrying such a conviction.

1436
01:04:25,910 --> 01:04:28,080
This is a determined expression.

1437
01:04:28,080 --> 01:04:31,680
No longer anxious. She's all good now.

1438
01:05:01,080 --> 01:05:03,610
An expression full of a sense of duty.

1439
01:05:05,480 --> 01:05:08,750
The cards are sold in the shopping center.

1440
01:05:08,750 --> 01:05:12,120
She was also told to get spring onion.

1441
01:05:15,890 --> 01:05:18,160
This is the main street of the town.

1442
01:05:18,160 --> 01:05:22,700
2 days ago it was bustling with people due to the soba festival.

1443
01:05:23,260 --> 01:05:27,000
The cake shop is also on this street.

1444
01:05:30,970 --> 01:05:34,340
Huh? Seems like she's getting cake first?

1445
01:05:34,340 --> 01:05:36,040
Welcome. Good day.

1446
01:05:36,180 --> 01:05:37,510
Good day.

1447
01:05:37,510 --> 01:05:40,580
Are you by yourself? What about your mama?

1448
01:05:40,580 --> 01:05:42,050
At home.

1449
01:05:42,050 --> 01:05:43,520
How remarkable.

1450
01:05:43,620 --> 01:05:47,090
Two gâteau au chocolat, please.

1451
01:05:46,050 --> 01:05:47,090
Gâteau au chocolat?

1452
01:05:47,090 --> 01:05:48,890
She's purchasing two?

1453
01:05:49,090 --> 01:05:53,030
One is for her sister. So the other is for herself?

1454
01:05:53,260 --> 01:05:56,700
Who will eat these gâteau au chocolat?

1455
01:05:56,700 --> 01:05:57,800
Is it for you?

1456
01:05:57,800 --> 01:06:02,570
Icchan and my big brother.

1457
01:06:02,570 --> 01:06:03,500
And your brother?

1458
01:06:03,500 --> 01:06:06,410
So she's getting one for her brother too?

1459
01:06:05,170 --> 01:06:07,340
How kind.

1460
01:06:06,410 --> 01:06:08,180
Please separate the two.

1461
01:06:08,180 --> 01:06:10,580
You are giving both? So you need two?

1462
01:06:10,580 --> 01:06:12,510
Please separate the two.

1463
01:06:12,510 --> 01:06:16,150
Oh you meant "separate" them? I'm sorry.

1464
01:06:16,150 --> 01:06:17,150
One more...

1465
01:06:17,150 --> 01:06:20,760
The old man is putting them in separate boxes.

1466
01:06:20,820 --> 01:06:22,560
Alright, 500 yen.

1467
01:06:22,560 --> 01:06:26,760
Even if she's getting two it's fine. There's still money left for the cards.

1468
01:06:27,930 --> 01:06:29,860
Be careful of the cars.

1469
01:06:30,670 --> 01:06:32,300
Do you know the way?

1470
01:06:33,030 --> 01:06:36,440
Which way is Maruni?

1471
01:06:34,340 --> 01:06:36,440
Maruni? It's that way.

1472
01:06:36,040 --> 01:06:38,570
Amazing that she could ask.

1473
01:06:37,440 --> 01:06:40,170
Next up is the most important thing - the cards.

1474
01:06:40,170 --> 01:06:45,450
The rumor has spread like wildfire all over town that Karin is on an errand.

1475
01:06:46,350 --> 01:06:47,850
Please do your best.

1476
01:06:47,850 --> 01:06:50,850
Karin, where are you going?

1477
01:06:50,850 --> 01:06:52,650
Maruni.

1478
01:06:51,450 --> 01:06:52,650
Maruni?

1479
01:06:52,650 --> 01:06:53,990
Please take care.

1480
01:06:53,190 --> 01:06:55,220
Shopping?

1481
01:06:53,990 --> 01:06:55,220
Please do your best.

1482
01:06:54,490 --> 01:06:56,690
This is amazing.

1483
01:06:55,220 --> 01:06:56,790
Off you go.

1484
01:06:56,790 --> 01:06:59,990
Loving the support.

1485
01:06:58,390 --> 01:07:03,730
Everyone has already heard about the ripped up cards. What a small world.

1486
01:07:04,400 --> 01:07:06,430
She has arrived at the shopping center.

1487
01:07:06,430 --> 01:07:09,300
I wonder if they have some good cards.

1488
01:07:09,300 --> 01:07:11,440
Good day.

1489
01:07:10,340 --> 01:07:12,910
Oh Karin, welcome.

1490
01:07:11,440 --> 01:07:14,610
The store owner is her father's senior Tacchan.

1491
01:07:15,040 --> 01:07:17,380
Icchan, you see...

1492
01:07:17,550 --> 01:07:21,550
I've accidentally ripped her cards so I've come to buy new ones.

1493
01:07:20,680 --> 01:07:21,550
I see.

1494
01:07:21,550 --> 01:07:23,680
Did she get mad?

1495
01:07:23,680 --> 01:07:24,720
Please wait.

1496
01:07:24,720 --> 01:07:27,060
There was only one pack left.

1497
01:07:27,060 --> 01:07:29,560
Tacchan has put it aside for her.

1498
01:07:29,560 --> 01:07:33,660
There are only these cards that cost 500 yen.

1499
01:07:33,660 --> 01:07:35,330
Is that okay?

1500
01:07:35,330 --> 01:07:37,330
Okay then. Follow me.

1501
01:07:38,370 --> 01:07:42,140
These cards have some popular characters on them.

1502
01:07:42,970 --> 01:07:45,640
Why did you rip Icchan's cards?

1503
01:07:46,110 --> 01:07:48,940
We were fighting.

1504
01:07:47,440 --> 01:07:48,940
You were fighting?

1505
01:07:48,940 --> 01:07:51,850
I bet Icchan became really upset.

1506
01:07:54,480 --> 01:07:56,420
Did you apologize?

1507
01:07:56,420 --> 01:08:01,960
To make her sister forgive her he wrapped it in luxurious wrapping.

1508
01:08:01,060 --> 01:08:03,090
She will surely be delighted.

1509
01:08:02,460 --> 01:08:04,230
1, 2, 3, 4.

1510
01:08:04,230 --> 01:08:06,990
He's giving her a 100 yen discount.

1511
01:08:07,030 --> 01:08:09,300
I received this from mama.

1512
01:08:09,300 --> 01:08:11,130
No no. You borrowed it.

1513
01:08:12,200 --> 01:08:15,600
She gave you some? How great.

1514
01:08:16,670 --> 01:08:18,470
Thank you very much.

1515
01:08:18,710 --> 01:08:20,010
See you again.

1516
01:08:21,740 --> 01:08:24,750
The spring onions are in the food section.

1517
01:08:24,750 --> 01:08:27,180
That's the errand her mother asked her to go on.

1518
01:08:27,180 --> 01:08:30,050
Spring onions for the soba she's making.

1519
01:08:29,350 --> 01:08:32,250
Pretty amazing she remembers all that.

1520
01:08:32,850 --> 01:08:34,560
Found it

1521
01:08:34,560 --> 01:08:37,160
She found it right away.

1522
01:08:37,160 --> 01:08:39,890
They are only for her father and grandmother.

1523
01:08:39,890 --> 01:08:42,400
Karin hasn't adjusted to the taste yet.

1524
01:08:44,630 --> 01:08:46,600
Good day.

1525
01:08:45,530 --> 01:08:46,600
Good day.

1526
01:08:46,600 --> 01:08:48,940
Did you come to shop all by yourself?

1527
01:08:49,270 --> 01:08:51,410
How remarkable.

1528
01:08:51,710 --> 01:08:53,640
That will be 213 yen.

1529
01:08:53,640 --> 01:08:55,810
Thank you for your hard work. You are remarkable.

1530
01:08:55,810 --> 01:09:00,050
When she says hello everyone returns the greeting with a smile.

1531
01:09:00,450 --> 01:09:04,520
Tacchan has been watching her the entire time.

1532
01:09:04,320 --> 01:09:06,190
How kind.

1533
01:09:05,920 --> 01:09:07,790
Please do your best rest of the way.

1534
01:09:11,530 --> 01:09:13,730
What a nice town.

1535
01:09:13,730 --> 01:09:15,060
How lovely.

1536
01:09:17,130 --> 01:09:20,370
She has bought the cards, the cake and the spring onions.

1537
01:09:20,370 --> 01:09:23,640
Next up is the homemade soba.

1538
01:09:23,640 --> 01:09:25,670
Many things to do.

1539
01:09:25,140 --> 01:09:27,740
Everyone is still there.

1540
01:09:29,540 --> 01:09:31,310
Every face is familiar.

1541
01:09:31,310 --> 01:09:33,250
What did you purchase?

1542
01:09:33,250 --> 01:09:34,880
Spring onions.

1543
01:09:34,880 --> 01:09:36,380
Spring onions.

1544
01:09:36,380 --> 01:09:38,120
Where are you heading now?

1545
01:09:37,250 --> 01:09:39,120
Soba.

1546
01:09:38,120 --> 01:09:39,120
She remembers.

1547
01:09:41,790 --> 01:09:44,560
There's also someone on the other side.

1548
01:09:46,130 --> 01:09:51,370
The old man from the cake shop was also worried so he's been watching from the outside the entire time.

1549
01:09:50,730 --> 01:09:52,330
How nice.

1550
01:09:51,800 --> 01:09:54,700
The people of this town are watching over her.

1551
01:09:55,540 --> 01:09:57,810
So it will be fine even if she's by herself.

1552
01:09:57,810 --> 01:10:00,040
She won't feel lonely.

1553
01:10:01,340 --> 01:10:04,710
Here at Kyoudoukan you can find the restaurant Soba Dojo.

1554
01:10:04,710 --> 01:10:08,180
It's a place to polish your soba making skills.

1555
01:10:08,180 --> 01:10:11,620
Her fathers junior, Tadayoshi, should be here today.

1556
01:10:13,420 --> 01:10:16,560
I've come to get soba.

1557
01:10:16,560 --> 01:10:17,860
This is Tadayoshi.

1558
01:10:17,890 --> 01:10:22,600
I will be making the soba now. Do you want to come and watch?

1559
01:10:22,960 --> 01:10:24,930
From scratch? That's quite something.

1560
01:10:23,700 --> 01:10:25,400
He will be making it now.

1561
01:10:25,400 --> 01:10:29,140
Since she came all the way he will show her how he makes it.

1562
01:10:29,140 --> 01:10:32,840
This is buckwheat soba. See it's greenish?

1563
01:10:32,840 --> 01:10:35,080
So buckwheat soba is greenish.

1564
01:10:35,080 --> 01:10:38,850
I will now turn this into noodles.

1565
01:10:38,850 --> 01:10:43,280
The principal occupation of Tadayoshi is pottery.

1566
01:10:43,520 --> 01:10:47,820
Here in Yamato they have a soba-making workshop for non-professionals

1567
01:10:47,820 --> 01:10:51,460
where you can get certified for soba-making.

1568
01:10:51,460 --> 01:10:55,030
Tadayoshi is so good he won the title of master in a tournament.

1569
01:10:54,760 --> 01:10:56,500
How amazing.

1570
01:10:55,300 --> 01:10:56,630
Do you like soba?

1571
01:10:56,630 --> 01:10:57,530
Yeah.

1572
01:10:57,970 --> 01:11:00,170
And papa also loves soba, right?

1573
01:11:00,170 --> 01:11:04,710
And grandma. And my brother.

1574
01:11:01,200 --> 01:11:03,070
Grandmother too?

1575
01:11:03,600 --> 01:11:04,710
And your brother?

1576
01:11:04,870 --> 01:11:06,470
And Icchan too.

1577
01:11:06,470 --> 01:11:08,040
So everyone loves it?

1578
01:11:08,040 --> 01:11:09,840
No, my mom hates it.

1579
01:11:11,050 --> 01:11:12,750
Shouldn't say that.

1580
01:11:11,680 --> 01:11:16,420
It's not that she hates it but she prefers rice.

1581
01:11:19,290 --> 01:11:22,690
What else did you buy today beside spring onion?

1582
01:11:21,860 --> 01:11:22,690
Cake.

1583
01:11:22,690 --> 01:11:25,560
You bought cake? Where did you get it?

1584
01:11:25,560 --> 01:11:28,760
Tadayoshi and Icchan.

1585
01:11:28,760 --> 01:11:29,560
Huh!?

1586
01:11:29,560 --> 01:11:32,600
I bought it for Tadayoshi and Icchan.

1587
01:11:32,600 --> 01:11:34,770
Her "brother" was Tadayoshi?

1588
01:11:34,770 --> 01:11:39,910
Since you always do your best making soba.

1589
01:11:38,470 --> 01:11:40,510
So that's how it is.

1590
01:11:39,870 --> 01:11:42,110
Tadayoshi is gleaming.

1591
01:11:42,110 --> 01:11:43,440
What else?

1592
01:11:43,680 --> 01:11:48,220
Icchan's Minion cards were ripped.

1593
01:11:48,220 --> 01:11:51,420
Who ripped them?

1594
01:11:51,420 --> 01:11:53,650
Karin, you ripped them?

1595
01:11:53,650 --> 01:11:58,330
And as an apology you are giving new ones to Icchan? How remarkable.

1596
01:11:59,460 --> 01:12:01,560
It's time to cut.

1597
01:12:05,800 --> 01:12:08,840
This is not something an amateur can do.

1598
01:12:12,310 --> 01:12:13,670
It's done.

1599
01:12:13,670 --> 01:12:16,140
How nice.

1600
01:12:14,580 --> 01:12:16,140
Nothing but a pro.

1601
01:12:16,440 --> 01:12:17,610
Looks delicious.

1602
01:12:18,110 --> 01:12:20,550
Here.

1603
01:12:18,910 --> 01:12:20,550
Thank you. You bought this for me.

1604
01:12:20,550 --> 01:12:23,750
The gâteau au chocolat she bought for Tadayoshiku.

1605
01:12:24,290 --> 01:12:27,560
Since he's not charging, this will be his reward.

1606
01:12:28,020 --> 01:12:29,060
Delicious.

1607
01:12:30,020 --> 01:12:35,500
Please smile a bit more. It's so delicious. Thanks.

1608
01:12:32,960 --> 01:12:35,500
Karin is also gleaming.

1609
01:12:34,600 --> 01:12:36,660
She really is gleaming.

1610
01:12:35,500 --> 01:12:36,860
Here.

1611
01:12:36,860 --> 01:12:40,570
Please take this to your mama.

1612
01:12:38,670 --> 01:12:40,570
Yes.

1613
01:12:40,570 --> 01:12:43,740
It's enough for all six in the family.

1614
01:12:55,080 --> 01:13:00,320
It's 4 o'clock and we will be hearing that thing.

1615
01:13:01,160 --> 01:13:02,690
There is it.

1616
01:13:04,890 --> 01:13:07,500
A town where the whistle of the steam locomotive echoes.

1617
01:13:07,730 --> 01:13:11,700
Even during tough times or when she wants to cry it suddenly changes her mood.

1618
01:13:11,700 --> 01:13:14,070
It's no longer raining.

1619
01:13:15,570 --> 01:13:17,240
She's walking with power.

1620
01:13:18,470 --> 01:13:22,510
Her mother did say: "Once she's set on something then she will do it."

1621
01:13:22,510 --> 01:13:25,510
The figure of her mother can be seen in the window.

1622
01:13:26,280 --> 01:13:28,350
She's on the verge of tears.

1623
01:13:29,080 --> 01:13:32,950
She has spotted Karin coming from the direction of the soba shop.

1624
01:13:32,950 --> 01:13:36,460
She's properly carrying the soba for six.

1625
01:13:36,660 --> 01:13:38,390
Karin.

1626
01:13:41,700 --> 01:13:43,430
Welcome home Karin.

1627
01:13:43,530 --> 01:13:44,470
Welcome home.

1628
01:13:44,470 --> 01:13:47,100
I'm home.

1629
01:13:45,330 --> 01:13:47,100
Come to the entrance.

1630
01:13:51,970 --> 01:13:53,410
Did you go to Tadayoshi-kun's place?

1631
01:13:53,410 --> 01:13:55,010
She even gave him cake.

1632
01:13:55,010 --> 01:13:57,550
You really did your best.

1633
01:13:59,350 --> 01:14:00,980
This is for Icchan.

1634
01:14:00,980 --> 01:14:02,980
Cake for her sister.

1635
01:14:03,320 --> 01:14:07,720
And Icchan's cards are inside this bag.

1636
01:14:07,720 --> 01:14:09,160
A new set of cards.

1637
01:14:09,160 --> 01:14:10,420
They were in stock?

1638
01:14:09,800 --> 01:14:11,280
Yep.

1639
01:14:11,360 --> 01:14:16,830
You must go with these and apologize so that she will forgive you.

1640
01:14:17,530 --> 01:14:20,800
You did will on your trip. Good job.

1641
01:14:20,800 --> 01:14:23,640
It would be nice if her sister forgave her.

1642
01:14:23,640 --> 01:14:24,940
You did your best.

1643
01:14:25,140 --> 01:14:26,210
Good day.

1644
01:14:26,210 --> 01:14:27,540
This is the big sister.

1645
01:14:27,540 --> 01:14:31,010
Will she able to properly apologize to her big sister?

1646
01:14:31,750 --> 01:14:35,820
Please come here. Hurry up.

1647
01:14:37,720 --> 01:14:39,790
Icchan.

1648
01:14:39,950 --> 01:14:46,660
I apologize for the other day when I ripped the Minion cards.

1649
01:14:45,690 --> 01:14:46,790
Thank you.

1650
01:14:46,790 --> 01:14:48,500
She was able to apologize.

1651
01:14:48,500 --> 01:14:50,400
Please hurry and open it.

1652
01:14:50,400 --> 01:14:53,670
Since they only had these she's curious if she will like them.

1653
01:14:56,640 --> 01:14:58,270
They are cute.

1654
01:14:57,540 --> 01:14:59,310
What a relief.

1655
01:14:58,270 --> 01:14:59,340
Thank you.

1656
01:14:59,340 --> 01:15:02,680
Her big sister loves these characters.

1657
01:15:04,910 --> 01:15:06,680
And one more thing.

1658
01:15:06,680 --> 01:15:07,950
Icchan.

1659
01:15:09,980 --> 01:15:11,890
I went to the cake shop.

1660
01:15:11,890 --> 01:15:14,890
Her sisters beloved gâteau au chocolat.

1661
01:15:16,790 --> 01:15:19,360
Thank you.

1662
01:15:19,460 --> 01:15:20,230
Furthermore...

1663
01:15:20,230 --> 01:15:23,400
Will you forgive me?

1664
01:15:21,800 --> 01:15:23,400
Alright.

1665
01:15:22,460 --> 01:15:24,030
How great.

1666
01:15:24,130 --> 01:15:26,370
I love you.

1667
01:15:26,370 --> 01:15:28,370
She was forgiven.

1668
01:15:30,600 --> 01:15:34,910
I almost cried but I bought soba by myself.

1669
01:15:36,110 --> 01:15:38,510
Her big sister loves soba.

1670
01:15:38,510 --> 01:15:40,950
Everyone is sharing it.

1671
01:15:41,580 --> 01:15:42,880
Mmmh.

1672
01:15:45,950 --> 01:15:48,920
After the meal they play cards for the first time in two weeks.

1673
01:15:51,560 --> 01:15:55,000
Karin, please don't get too hotheaded again.

1674
01:15:56,560 --> 01:15:59,730
All around well done.

1675
01:16:01,640 --> 01:16:03,640
An errand for an apology.

1676
01:16:03,640 --> 01:16:05,670
And she did apologize, right?

1677
01:16:05,670 --> 01:16:08,780
Why are you crying?

1678
01:16:07,470 --> 01:16:08,780
I'm sorry.

1679
01:16:08,780 --> 01:16:11,650
It hit bull's-eye.

1680
01:16:10,110 --> 01:16:11,650
Isn't that right.

1681
01:16:11,650 --> 01:16:14,010
I was so happy she was able to say it.

1682
01:16:14,010 --> 01:16:17,550
I was worried that the 2 yen didn't amount to anything but she did it.

1683
01:16:17,050 --> 01:16:20,990
Smashing the piggy bank and only finding 2 yen.

1684
01:16:19,420 --> 01:16:20,990
Yeah, what can you do with 2 yen?

1685
01:16:20,990 --> 01:16:23,390
Hotta, you also cried a lot.

1686
01:16:22,390 --> 01:16:23,390
Yeah a bit.

1687
01:16:23,390 --> 01:16:27,030
A siblings fight.

1688
01:16:23,390 --> 01:16:27,030
A siblings fight. Yeah, it's not good.

1689
01:16:27,030 --> 01:16:30,160
Did it remind you of your big brother?

1690
01:16:28,360 --> 01:16:30,160
That's right when we fought...

1691
01:16:30,160 --> 01:16:34,200
I could never apologize sincerely.

1692
01:16:34,200 --> 01:16:36,270
What an honest child.

1693
01:16:36,270 --> 01:16:40,640
- but the whole town felt so warm. What a nice upbringing.

1694
01:16:39,710 --> 01:16:40,640
- That's right.

1695
01:16:40,640 --> 01:16:45,310
Yeah, it makes you want to be raised in such a town.

1696
01:16:45,310 --> 01:16:50,250
But since I live in Tokyo it's just not like that here.

1697
01:16:50,250 --> 01:16:52,750
But there it seems like everyone knows each other.

1698
01:16:52,750 --> 01:16:57,290
As expected from an "Errand" fan. Great analysis.

1699
01:16:56,290 --> 01:16:57,290
It's fine.

1700
01:16:57,290 --> 01:17:01,530
Next up is the big adventure of a talkative little girl.

1701
01:17:01,580 --> 01:17:04,570
When bringing up the subject of an errand

1702
01:17:04,570 --> 01:17:07,170
she became so delighted.

1703
01:17:07,170 --> 01:17:09,340
Hikari, can you go?

1704
01:17:09,340 --> 01:17:11,040
Yaaay.

1705
01:17:11,040 --> 01:17:12,270
Please have a look.

1706
01:17:11,040 --> 01:17:13,990
Hikari
3 years
4 months

1707
01:17:13,010 --> 01:17:17,340
Her fathers handmade flag for crossing the street.

1708
01:17:17,340 --> 01:17:22,420
She will be highly visible since it reflects the sunlight.

1709
01:17:17,760 --> 01:17:22,930
I'm crossing.
















Thanks.

1710
01:17:18,440 --> 01:17:22,970
Hikari
3 years
4 months

1711
01:17:21,420 --> 01:17:24,750
3 years and 4 months?

1712
01:17:23,180 --> 01:17:26,990
Big brother

1713
01:17:23,180 --> 01:17:26,990
Father

1714
01:17:23,180 --> 01:17:26,990
Mother

1715
01:17:23,750 --> 01:17:26,050
Full of vigor and hates losing.

1716
01:17:26,050 --> 01:17:30,520
She smooth talks her, 2-year older, brother to get him to do things.

1717
01:17:30,520 --> 01:17:35,330
Everyone says she was born with a gift of chatter.

1718
01:17:35,660 --> 01:17:37,200
Talking about errands

1719
01:17:35,660 --> 01:17:48,580
Saitama ● Chichibu

1720
01:17:37,200 --> 01:17:40,270
there's not a single shop closeby.

1721
01:17:40,730 --> 01:17:47,440
Ah, there is a single shop. A mechanic. So her mother is sending her on an errand to get a car fixed.

1722
01:17:48,080 --> 01:17:50,510
It has a light scratch.

1723
01:17:50,510 --> 01:17:54,110
It's an errand to get a forgotten object inside of the car.

1724
01:17:54,110 --> 01:17:55,450
And the forgotten thing is...

1725
01:17:55,820 --> 01:17:59,620
A pink photo album that Hikari knows well.

1726
01:17:59,620 --> 01:18:00,390
Inside it...

1727
01:18:00,250 --> 01:18:05,060
Mother

1728
01:18:00,390 --> 01:18:05,060
When her mother was young and on a young people cultural exchange program.

1729
01:18:05,530 --> 01:18:08,460
She helped as a midwife.

1730
01:18:08,730 --> 01:18:10,860
Full of experience.

1731
01:18:09,630 --> 01:18:14,800
The friends from 15 years ago came to their house yesterday and they held a party.

1732
01:18:14,800 --> 01:18:20,370
And the friends feigned having forgotten the photo album in the car.

1733
01:18:20,970 --> 01:18:25,780
To get to the mechanic she has to follow the long road

1734
01:18:25,780 --> 01:18:31,320
and she was asked to get two peach juice bottles from the vending machine.

1735
01:18:31,420 --> 01:18:32,950
The dazzling smile of

1736
01:18:32,950 --> 01:18:34,150
Hikarichan.

1737
01:18:34,150 --> 01:18:35,590
The dazzling smile of

1738
01:18:35,590 --> 01:18:36,820
Hikarichan.

1739
01:18:37,690 --> 01:18:38,560
So cute.

1740
01:18:38,560 --> 01:18:40,060
Off I go.

1741
01:18:40,060 --> 01:18:42,760
Remember to say hello.

1742
01:18:43,030 --> 01:18:45,000
Full of vigor and hates losing.

1743
01:18:45,000 --> 01:18:46,870
Off she goes.

1744
01:18:49,040 --> 01:18:52,570
How come?

1745
01:18:52,140 --> 01:18:53,640
How come?

1746
01:18:52,570 --> 01:18:54,010
What's up?

1747
01:18:55,340 --> 01:18:59,210
How did they forget it?

1748
01:18:57,310 --> 01:18:59,210
She's mad.

1749
01:18:59,210 --> 01:19:00,380
She's complaining.

1750
01:19:01,010 --> 01:19:02,480
Good grief.

1751
01:19:02,480 --> 01:19:03,480
She said good grief.

1752
01:19:03,480 --> 01:19:06,050
But she will go get it.

1753
01:19:10,660 --> 01:19:13,290
Recently she's been learning her numbers.

1754
01:19:12,960 --> 01:19:14,390
Remarkable.

1755
01:19:22,840 --> 01:19:25,440
She can even count past 21?

1756
01:19:24,910 --> 01:19:26,310
How amazing.

1757
01:19:26,570 --> 01:19:29,440
She can count to 39.

1758
01:19:29,440 --> 01:19:30,910
I'm so smart!

1759
01:19:33,210 --> 01:19:38,490
Ah, it's within sight. It's within sight.

1760
01:19:38,490 --> 01:19:39,690
Where, where?

1761
01:19:39,690 --> 01:19:43,960
If I go there the photo album should be there.

1762
01:19:43,960 --> 01:19:45,930
I'm so smart.

1763
01:19:46,260 --> 01:19:48,830
She has spotted the mint green wall.

1764
01:19:49,300 --> 01:19:51,800
Her eyes are as sharp as her mind.

1765
01:19:53,270 --> 01:19:56,540
Here I don't have to be too attentive to cars.

1766
01:19:56,540 --> 01:19:59,540
She even knows the term for "being attentive to cars".

1767
01:19:59,540 --> 01:20:01,640
That's right, there are no crossings here.

1768
01:20:01,640 --> 01:20:04,010
It's straight ahead on this one road.

1769
01:20:04,010 --> 01:20:05,910
She's so smart.

1770
01:20:06,150 --> 01:20:09,480
The weather is nice and not windy.

1771
01:20:09,480 --> 01:20:10,550
Oh no.

1772
01:20:10,550 --> 01:20:11,850
Huh? What's up?

1773
01:20:11,850 --> 01:20:13,650
The wind is blowing.

1774
01:20:13,650 --> 01:20:16,720
That's what her mother always exclaims when she's hanging clothes.

1775
01:20:16,720 --> 01:20:17,960
Phew.

1776
01:20:17,960 --> 01:20:18,990
Good grief.

1777
01:20:18,990 --> 01:20:21,860
She has learned to say good grief from her brother.

1778
01:20:21,860 --> 01:20:23,530
Huh?

1779
01:20:23,530 --> 01:20:25,170
Looks like it will rain.

1780
01:20:25,370 --> 01:20:27,170
Looks like it will rain.

1781
01:20:27,170 --> 01:20:29,240
That's also what her mother often says.

1782
01:20:30,000 --> 01:20:32,770
Not a chance that it will rain today.

1783
01:20:56,460 --> 01:20:59,400
She has finally arrived at the crossing.

1784
01:20:59,400 --> 01:21:02,870
Should I be attentive to cars?

1785
01:21:02,870 --> 01:21:04,710
[Baby talk.]

1786
01:21:04,910 --> 01:21:07,410
Since there's no crossing around here

1787
01:21:07,410 --> 01:21:10,510
the father has talked with the traffic police

1788
01:21:10,510 --> 01:21:13,450
who has lent him a safety cone.

1789
01:21:13,880 --> 01:21:16,020
The dazzling smile of Hikarichan.

1790
01:21:16,020 --> 01:21:18,350
Will she notice it?

1791
01:21:20,520 --> 01:21:22,560
Stop.

1792
01:21:22,560 --> 01:21:24,760
Beep.

1793
01:21:28,400 --> 01:21:32,900
Father, Hikari is doing it properly.

1794
01:21:33,400 --> 01:21:34,900
How remarkable.

1795
01:21:34,270 --> 01:21:38,270
There are none. I did it.

1796
01:21:38,270 --> 01:21:42,410
Her hands are free cause she doesn't have to carry the flag.

1797
01:21:42,940 --> 01:21:47,280
It's within sight. I did it.

1798
01:21:47,510 --> 01:21:49,980
How great that I made it.

1799
01:21:51,990 --> 01:21:55,290
The white car belongs to her household.

1800
01:21:55,290 --> 01:21:58,390
The vending machine.

1801
01:21:58,390 --> 01:22:00,760
If I go there, will I arrive?

1802
01:22:01,090 --> 01:22:04,530
She's getting the peach juice first.

1803
01:22:04,630 --> 01:22:06,300
Money?

1804
01:22:06,470 --> 01:22:08,070
The silver ones are 100 yen.

1805
01:22:08,070 --> 01:22:10,600
And the brown are 10 yen. She knows that well.

1806
01:22:10,600 --> 01:22:13,010
The peach juice costs 110 yen.

1807
01:22:13,910 --> 01:22:15,780
How high.

1808
01:22:13,910 --> 01:22:18,610
The word for expensive and tall is the same.

1809
01:22:16,240 --> 01:22:18,610
Not the price but the button.

1810
01:22:18,610 --> 01:22:23,780
Her mother asked her to get the juice on the top row so that she has to call the old man for help.

1811
01:22:23,780 --> 01:22:25,650
It's impossible.

1812
01:22:24,520 --> 01:22:25,650
Yeah, it's impossible.

1813
01:22:27,720 --> 01:22:30,860
She can reach the money slot but...

1814
01:22:30,860 --> 01:22:32,860
How will she do it?

1815
01:22:32,430 --> 01:22:36,600
Though it's so close to me I just can't reach.

1816
01:22:36,600 --> 01:22:39,070
The peach juice that's close but far.

1817
01:22:39,670 --> 01:22:42,200
I can't reach up there.

1818
01:22:42,200 --> 01:22:44,470
Can't reach even if I jump.

1819
01:22:44,810 --> 01:22:47,310
Ah, what a shame.

1820
01:22:46,170 --> 01:22:48,680
Even though she could go and ask the mechanic.

1821
01:22:50,910 --> 01:22:54,850
I can't reach up there.

1822
01:22:54,850 --> 01:22:58,650
She's been mumbling to herself for 20 minutes.

1823
01:22:58,650 --> 01:23:02,990
It's so high up there. How difficult.

1824
01:23:03,760 --> 01:23:05,530
And at that moment.

1825
01:23:05,530 --> 01:23:08,800
Good day.

1826
01:23:07,230 --> 01:23:09,230
Amazing. She can yell.

1827
01:23:08,800 --> 01:23:11,330
She called out with a loud voice.

1828
01:23:13,700 --> 01:23:16,370
Good day.

1829
01:23:16,500 --> 01:23:18,070
Oh, over there?

1830
01:23:18,070 --> 01:23:21,240
It's rare that a small customer stops by.

1831
01:23:21,240 --> 01:23:23,080
Did you call me?

1832
01:23:22,010 --> 01:23:23,080
I can't reach.

1833
01:23:23,080 --> 01:23:25,180
I see, you can't reach.

1834
01:23:25,880 --> 01:23:28,920
I will carry you so you can push.

1835
01:23:29,020 --> 01:23:30,480
Is that alright?

1836
01:23:31,350 --> 01:23:32,190
Which one?

1837
01:23:32,190 --> 01:23:34,790
He's letting her do it herself.

1838
01:23:36,390 --> 01:23:37,590
One more.

1839
01:23:37,590 --> 01:23:40,490
After 20 minutes she finally got one bottle.

1840
01:23:40,490 --> 01:23:44,800
And... Mama said to buy two.

1841
01:23:44,800 --> 01:23:47,870
Mama told Hikari, "I'll leave it up to you."

1842
01:23:47,870 --> 01:23:49,670
She was asked by her mother but...

1843
01:23:49,670 --> 01:23:52,340
The old man is wondering if it's only about juice.

1844
01:23:56,310 --> 01:23:58,980
Did you only come to buy juice?

1845
01:23:57,940 --> 01:23:58,980
Yeah.

1846
01:23:58,980 --> 01:24:01,420
How remarkable.

1847
01:23:59,380 --> 01:24:01,420
What about the photo album?

1848
01:24:01,420 --> 01:24:02,620
How remarkable.

1849
01:24:02,620 --> 01:24:04,680
Goodbye.

1850
01:24:04,680 --> 01:24:05,620
What?

1851
01:24:05,620 --> 01:24:07,520
There's nothing else that you need to do?

1852
01:24:07,120 --> 01:24:07,520
Yep.

1853
01:24:07,520 --> 01:24:10,090
I didn't forget a single thing.

1854
01:24:10,090 --> 01:24:14,860
Oh, she remembered. Yeah. That thing.

1855
01:24:14,860 --> 01:24:16,400
Ah, I forgot the money.

1856
01:24:18,830 --> 01:24:20,030
I forgot it.

1857
01:24:20,030 --> 01:24:23,270
When she purchased the second one she put in 200 yen.

1858
01:24:23,270 --> 01:24:27,370
She remembered about the change. 90 yen.

1859
01:24:27,370 --> 01:24:29,370
She forgot the change.

1860
01:24:29,370 --> 01:24:31,180
I forgot this.

1861
01:24:31,180 --> 01:24:32,910
It's good that I noticed.

1862
01:24:32,680 --> 01:24:34,210
How good.

1863
01:24:33,850 --> 01:24:39,320
She has completely forgotten about the thing in the car.

1864
01:24:39,750 --> 01:24:43,490
As she's about to head home the phone rings at the mechanic.

1865
01:24:44,320 --> 01:24:49,500
It's the mother. It's been an hour since she left home and she's worried.

1866
01:24:49,500 --> 01:24:50,630
Hello.

1867
01:24:50,630 --> 01:24:52,830
Did Hikari come that way?

1868
01:24:52,830 --> 01:24:57,300
Can I talk with her?

1869
01:24:56,140 --> 01:24:57,300
Yes.

1870
01:24:58,610 --> 01:25:00,740
A phone call from mama. Mama.

1871
01:25:00,740 --> 01:25:02,280
Say hello to her.

1872
01:25:02,280 --> 01:25:03,440
Hello.

1873
01:25:03,440 --> 01:25:05,110
Hikari are you okay?

1874
01:25:05,110 --> 01:25:09,980
I got two peach juice out.

1875
01:25:09,980 --> 01:25:12,690
You were able to buy the peach juice?

1876
01:25:12,720 --> 01:25:14,920
And with that I will come home.

1877
01:25:14,920 --> 01:25:15,990
That's not right.

1878
01:25:15,990 --> 01:25:17,760
Doctor Nonchan

1879
01:25:17,760 --> 01:25:19,330
said that she forgot it.

1880
01:25:19,330 --> 01:25:22,700
The photo album. The pink one.

1881
01:25:20,460 --> 01:25:22,700
Yep yep.

1882
01:25:23,730 --> 01:25:25,370
She remembered.

1883
01:25:24,500 --> 01:25:26,030
So that's how it was.

1884
01:25:26,030 --> 01:25:27,400
That's right.

1885
01:25:27,630 --> 01:25:29,300
Bye bye.

1886
01:25:27,630 --> 01:25:29,300
See you.

1887
01:25:30,070 --> 01:25:32,410
What did your mother tell you?

1888
01:25:32,410 --> 01:25:35,110
Album.

1889
01:25:33,870 --> 01:25:35,110
Album?

1890
01:25:35,240 --> 01:25:36,440
Where is it?

1891
01:25:36,440 --> 01:25:37,780
Inside the car.

1892
01:25:37,780 --> 01:25:39,350
Behind.

1893
01:25:38,580 --> 01:25:39,350
Behind?

1894
01:25:39,350 --> 01:25:41,080
Alright, let's look for it.

1895
01:25:41,080 --> 01:25:43,450
Found it.

1896
01:25:43,450 --> 01:25:46,990
Yay, I found it.

1897
01:25:45,320 --> 01:25:46,990
The pink album.

1898
01:25:46,990 --> 01:25:51,060
The thing that she wondered "how her mother's friends forgot".

1899
01:25:51,730 --> 01:25:52,730
Found it.

1900
01:25:52,730 --> 01:25:54,730
You did well.

1901
01:25:54,730 --> 01:25:56,360
Thank you very much.

1902
01:25:56,360 --> 01:25:57,330
Remarkable.

1903
01:25:58,030 --> 01:26:00,470
How did they forget it?

1904
01:26:00,900 --> 01:26:03,100
Good grief.

1905
01:26:04,070 --> 01:26:08,780
She's crossing the street properly where her father has put the cones.

1906
01:26:11,110 --> 01:26:13,210
Bye bye.

1907
01:26:16,920 --> 01:26:19,050
Mama, I found it.

1908
01:26:19,050 --> 01:26:20,690
Huh, phone?

1909
01:26:20,690 --> 01:26:21,560
Yes yes

1910
01:26:21,560 --> 01:26:23,520
I found it.

1911
01:26:24,690 --> 01:26:26,860
What a convenient mobile.

1912
01:26:26,860 --> 01:26:29,830
Ah, I found it.

1913
01:26:29,830 --> 01:26:32,230
I didn't know, mama!

1914
01:26:32,230 --> 01:26:35,300
She doesn't feel lonely as long as she talks to her mother.

1915
01:26:34,100 --> 01:26:35,300
Bye bye.

1916
01:26:35,740 --> 01:26:37,840
She is so cu-t-e.

1917
01:26:39,140 --> 01:26:42,340
Mama, I'm tired.

1918
01:26:42,340 --> 01:26:43,610
Still on the phone?

1919
01:26:47,110 --> 01:26:50,650
Better go back home.

1920
01:27:01,930 --> 01:27:04,530
I can see it.

1921
01:27:04,760 --> 01:27:05,830
Arrival.

1922
01:27:05,830 --> 01:27:09,340
Arriving in just a bit, I wonder.

1923
01:27:12,710 --> 01:27:14,610
I did it.

1924
01:27:14,610 --> 01:27:16,680
I finally arrived.

1925
01:27:16,680 --> 01:27:18,350
I'm home.

1926
01:27:18,350 --> 01:27:21,050
Were you able to go?

1927
01:27:19,450 --> 01:27:21,050
Yeah.

1928
01:27:22,350 --> 01:27:23,720
You have it.

1929
01:27:24,620 --> 01:27:26,950
Hikarichan.

1930
01:27:27,350 --> 01:27:31,390
You brought it back? You really helped out.

1931
01:27:31,390 --> 01:27:33,330
And two juice bottles.

1932
01:27:33,330 --> 01:27:35,060
And you also got two juice?

1933
01:27:35,060 --> 01:27:36,830
You managed to buy it?

1934
01:27:37,860 --> 01:27:41,970
The father did a nice job today behind-the-scenes.

1935
01:27:42,470 --> 01:27:45,510
Maybe he's been watching over her from somewhere.

1936
01:27:47,670 --> 01:27:49,540
The dazzling smile of

1937
01:27:49,540 --> 01:27:50,740
Hikarichan.

1938
01:27:50,740 --> 01:27:52,450
The dazzling smile of

1939
01:27:52,450 --> 01:27:53,380
Hikarichan.

1940
01:27:53,380 --> 01:27:56,650
Who can go on errands now?

1941
01:27:55,080 --> 01:27:56,650
I can.

1942
01:27:56,650 --> 01:27:58,180
Say yes.

1943
01:27:57,320 --> 01:27:58,180
Yes.

1944
01:27:58,180 --> 01:28:00,990
The excellent doer with a dazzling smile.

1945
01:28:01,790 --> 01:28:03,260
Cute.

1946
01:28:05,030 --> 01:28:13,370
After this the son of the Japanese rugby team captain will go on a grand adventure.

1947
01:28:13,370 --> 01:28:16,070
And tears of endurance.

1948
01:28:16,070 --> 01:28:20,840
A mother's emotional anguish.

1949
01:28:21,440 --> 01:28:24,040
What a bright and energetic child, wasn't she?

1950
01:28:24,040 --> 01:28:27,380
Angel... That's right.

1951
01:28:24,680 --> 01:28:27,380
She was so smart and lucid.

1952
01:28:27,650 --> 01:28:33,120
And that scene that walks along with her and then the drone zooms out.

1953
01:28:33,120 --> 01:28:35,720
That must've been so expensive.

1954
01:28:35,720 --> 01:28:37,190
You thought about that?

1955
01:28:37,190 --> 01:28:39,190
To use a drone...

1956
01:28:39,190 --> 01:28:43,030
Of course I was also moved by other things but

1957
01:28:43,030 --> 01:28:45,370
all of this was done for Hikari.

1958
01:28:45,370 --> 01:28:52,240
I am raising a daughter and when I look at Hikari I notice how much she copies her mothers' speech.

1959
01:28:52,240 --> 01:28:53,840
Like "I'm so smart"

1960
01:28:53,840 --> 01:28:55,640
and "good grief".

1961
01:28:55,640 --> 01:28:57,810
I better be careful too.

1962
01:28:57,910 --> 01:29:01,580
Three year olds

1963
01:29:01,580 --> 01:29:03,050
they absorb new words

1964
01:29:03,050 --> 01:29:05,790
but can't put them together well

1965
01:29:05,790 --> 01:29:08,150
which I think is normal.

1966
01:29:08,150 --> 01:29:11,860
But seeing how she's speaking sentences amazes me.

1967
01:29:08,770 --> 01:29:12,090
I'm close but can't reach it.

1968
01:29:09,740 --> 01:29:12,090
How unfortunate.

1969
01:29:11,860 --> 01:29:15,300
When my son was three years old

1970
01:29:15,300 --> 01:29:17,660
he was obsessed with Super Sentai

1971
01:29:17,660 --> 01:29:22,670
and he wanted to play fight but he only understands the overall mood

1972
01:29:22,670 --> 01:29:25,740
And he would hold a sword and say

1973
01:29:25,740 --> 01:29:28,940
It's you, isn't it?

1974
01:29:28,310 --> 01:29:30,510
I totally get that.

1975
01:29:31,080 --> 01:29:35,650
It's you, isn't it? Who do you think you are?

1976
01:29:36,250 --> 01:29:37,550
Complete nonsensical.

1977
01:29:38,180 --> 01:29:41,390
I had no clue what my role was.

1978
01:29:42,020 --> 01:29:44,420
Collagen​. Collagen.

1979
01:29:44,420 --> 01:29:48,430
A kid was asked on an errand at a shop within sight.

1980
01:29:48,960 --> 01:29:51,530
I wonder what collagen is?

1981
01:29:50,700 --> 01:29:52,600
It's right there.

1982
01:29:51,630 --> 01:29:57,370
Base for collagen soup. The mother intends to make soup pasta.

1983
01:29:57,540 --> 01:29:59,370
What are you going to purchase?

1984
01:29:58,570 --> 01:29:59,370
Collagen.

1985
01:29:59,370 --> 01:30:02,110
He can finally say it.

1986
01:30:02,110 --> 01:30:04,210
Eh? He's this small?

1987
01:30:04,210 --> 01:30:05,450
Collagen.

1988
01:30:05,450 --> 01:30:06,880
Collagen.

1989
01:30:07,150 --> 01:30:09,980
The is the 3 year and 3 month old Mao.

1990
01:30:09,980 --> 01:30:11,150
Can you say it?

1991
01:30:11,150 --> 01:30:13,750
Who said that they wanted to eat it?

1992
01:30:12,750 --> 01:30:13,750
Hmm...

1993
01:30:13,750 --> 01:30:16,260
Papa.

1994
01:30:14,220 --> 01:30:16,260
That's right. Papa said he wanted to eat it.

1995
01:30:16,260 --> 01:30:18,790
Can you go purchase it for papa?

1996
01:30:18,630 --> 01:30:21,530
- He's not listening. Not at all.
- He's not listening.

1997
01:30:21,960 --> 01:30:27,230
The shop's parking lot is in front of their house. He's small but he can run.

1998
01:30:28,300 --> 01:30:32,410
Collagen is such a difficult word. Wonder if he will remember it.

1999
01:30:32,410 --> 01:30:33,340
What's with that?

2000
01:30:37,880 --> 01:30:39,750
This please.

2001
01:30:39,750 --> 01:30:41,450
He pointed at something.

2002
01:30:41,450 --> 01:30:42,750
What do you want?

2003
01:30:42,750 --> 01:30:43,580
This.

2004
01:30:43,980 --> 01:30:47,190
What he pointed at is shoulder roast.

2005
01:30:46,720 --> 01:30:49,720
- It's collagen.

2006
01:30:47,950 --> 01:30:49,720
- Oh you!

2007
01:30:48,660 --> 01:30:50,190
How much do you want?

2008
01:30:50,190 --> 01:30:51,660
Two.

2009
01:30:51,660 --> 01:30:55,260
Apologies to mom but he couldn't say collagen.

2010
01:30:57,360 --> 01:31:02,040
The shady looking guy behind the cover is the father having a peek.

2011
01:31:02,440 --> 01:31:06,810
He is dressed up like the staff but you do recognize who he is, don't you?

2012
01:31:07,170 --> 01:31:10,810
It's the Japanese rugby team captain Tanaka Fumiyaki.

2013
01:31:10,810 --> 01:31:13,650
With his mere height of 166 cm and a small build

2014
01:31:13,950 --> 01:31:18,380
he's the small giant who smashes against the big boys.

2015
01:31:18,650 --> 01:31:21,990
Rated as top 8 in all world cup history.

2016
01:31:21,990 --> 01:31:25,790
It's a father who has made history.

2017
01:31:28,130 --> 01:31:33,500
And the mother who is watching a match and handling this boy like a rugby ball.

2018
01:31:33,500 --> 01:31:36,900
That's the boy who is trying to purchase collagen.

2019
01:31:37,640 --> 01:31:40,670
This time he's the one spectating his son and his errand.

2020
01:31:40,870 --> 01:31:42,340
Thank you for waiting.

2021
01:31:42,340 --> 01:31:45,080
He got shoulder roast which he wasn't asked to get.

2022
01:31:44,980 --> 01:31:46,950
How come?

2023
01:31:46,080 --> 01:31:48,480
Mama. Mama.

2024
01:31:48,480 --> 01:31:51,850
Looks like he hasn't noticed his father.

2025
01:31:52,020 --> 01:31:56,420
Heading straight back to his house through the parking lot.

2026
01:31:56,420 --> 01:31:59,060
Alright. No cars in sight.

2027
01:31:59,660 --> 01:32:01,290
Try (rugby term).

2028
01:32:02,600 --> 01:32:03,800
Are you okay?

2029
01:32:03,800 --> 01:32:07,770
He is fine but his purchase isn't.

2030
01:32:07,770 --> 01:32:09,300
Did you buy it?

2031
01:32:09,800 --> 01:32:12,570
Did you buy it? What did you buy?

2032
01:32:13,010 --> 01:32:14,870
Sliced shoulder roasts.

2033
01:32:14,870 --> 01:32:16,870
We want to make soup pasta.

2034
01:32:17,580 --> 01:32:20,910
That's why we want collagen. Wait wait.

2035
01:32:18,980 --> 01:32:20,910
He's not listening.

2036
01:32:19,650 --> 01:32:20,910
One more time.

2037
01:32:20,910 --> 01:32:24,050
Got it. Just hold up.

2038
01:32:21,280 --> 01:32:24,050
One more time. I made a mistake.

2039
01:32:24,050 --> 01:32:27,490
His mother told him it's wrong and she wants him to do it right.

2040
01:32:28,690 --> 01:32:33,330
Ema
6 years 1 months

2041
01:32:28,690 --> 01:32:33,330
Father

2042
01:32:28,690 --> 01:32:33,330
Mao
3 years 3 months

2043
01:32:28,690 --> 01:32:33,330
Mother

2044
01:32:29,020 --> 01:32:33,160
The father is away from home about half of the year.

2045
01:32:33,160 --> 01:32:34,960
The reliable big sister.

2046
01:32:34,960 --> 01:32:36,630
Thanks to her

2047
01:32:36,630 --> 01:32:41,330
they conceived an errand for Mao.

2048
01:32:41,600 --> 01:32:43,330
This is the second errand.

2049
01:32:43,330 --> 01:32:46,770
The mother is making him go to the butcher in front of their house.

2050
01:32:46,970 --> 01:32:51,910
If he can do this then the follow-up errand will be to go to a supermarket.

2051
01:32:51,010 --> 01:32:52,250
I see.

2052
01:32:52,080 --> 01:32:52,980
Well...

2053
01:32:52,980 --> 01:32:55,320
Don't you want to see your daddy delighted?

2054
01:32:55,320 --> 01:32:58,620
When his father is brought up Mao does what he is told.

2055
01:32:58,620 --> 01:33:01,020
The sister gives him some advice.

2056
01:33:01,020 --> 01:33:02,590
Collagen. Don't touch that.

2057
01:33:02,590 --> 01:33:03,560
It's a camera.

2058
01:33:03,560 --> 01:33:06,660
The power company is measuring things right now.

2059
01:33:08,060 --> 01:33:11,900
Can't help that his face is just like mine.

2060
01:33:10,300 --> 01:33:12,800
- Spitting image.

2061
01:33:11,230 --> 01:33:12,800
- Spitting image.

2062
01:33:11,900 --> 01:33:15,670
He has no idea that his father is watching him.

2063
01:33:25,140 --> 01:33:26,510
Collagen.

2064
01:33:25,680 --> 01:33:26,510
Collagen.

2065
01:33:26,510 --> 01:33:28,510
Still needs to get collagen.

2066
01:33:28,510 --> 01:33:29,820
Say: "Kora!".

2067
01:33:28,510 --> 01:33:34,180
Kora means "hey you!" and starts the same way as collagen.

2068
01:33:29,820 --> 01:33:32,890
Hey-gen.

2069
01:33:30,450 --> 01:33:32,020
Yep, collagen.

2070
01:33:32,890 --> 01:33:34,290
5 days ago.

2071
01:33:34,290 --> 01:33:36,520
His father trained him.

2072
01:33:36,520 --> 01:33:37,960
Spring onion.

2073
01:33:37,960 --> 01:33:40,430
Can he purchase what he's asked to get?

2074
01:33:40,430 --> 01:33:41,530
Gum.

2075
01:33:41,530 --> 01:33:43,330
Gum.

2076
01:33:43,330 --> 01:33:44,930
Let's find a shop assistant.

2077
01:33:45,230 --> 01:33:46,930
He needs to purchase gum.

2078
01:33:46,930 --> 01:33:48,270
Excuse me.

2079
01:33:48,270 --> 01:33:49,700
He was able to ask.

2080
01:33:49,700 --> 01:33:52,510
Where are the "turnips"?

2081
01:33:51,070 --> 01:33:53,840
- Turnips.

2082
01:33:52,140 --> 01:33:53,840
- Sounds similar.

2083
01:33:52,510 --> 01:33:55,440
Turnips? Let me take you there.

2084
01:33:55,880 --> 01:33:58,380
They are heading to the vegetable section.

2085
01:33:57,040 --> 01:33:59,510
What a shame.

2086
01:34:02,420 --> 01:34:05,650
Mao, are you going to purchase this?

2087
01:34:05,650 --> 01:34:06,790
Gum.

2088
01:34:06,790 --> 01:34:07,620
Turnips (Kabu).

2089
01:34:07,620 --> 01:34:08,550
Gu

2090
01:34:08,550 --> 01:34:09,120
Ka

2091
01:34:09,120 --> 01:34:09,990
Gu

2092
01:34:09,990 --> 01:34:11,120
Turnips.

2093
01:34:12,130 --> 01:34:13,120
The confectionary.

2094
01:34:13,120 --> 01:34:14,790
The confectionary.

2095
01:34:14,790 --> 01:34:15,860
Gum.

2096
01:34:15,860 --> 01:34:17,460
Turnips.

2097
01:34:18,000 --> 01:34:19,970
Why not make him get turnips then?

2098
01:34:19,970 --> 01:34:20,970
Since then.

2099
01:34:20,970 --> 01:34:23,440
Look right and left first and raise your hand.

2100
01:34:23,440 --> 01:34:24,840
He's progressed a lot.

2101
01:34:24,840 --> 01:34:25,610
I'm asking you.

2102
01:34:25,610 --> 01:34:26,810
It's collagen.

2103
01:34:26,870 --> 01:34:28,980
He understands how to go on errands now.

2104
01:34:28,980 --> 01:34:30,580
Also how to pay.

2105
01:34:30,580 --> 01:34:33,480
And the names of various products.

2106
01:34:33,480 --> 01:34:36,280
Alright and today it's collagen. right?

2107
01:34:36,280 --> 01:34:39,890
Chicken thighs, please.

2108
01:34:39,320 --> 01:34:41,820
Chicken thighs.

2109
01:34:42,760 --> 01:34:45,220
The 3 year and 3 month old Mao.

2110
01:34:45,220 --> 01:34:47,530
He's progressed a lot.

2111
01:34:47,530 --> 01:34:48,730
It's collagen.

2112
01:34:48,730 --> 01:34:50,900
He understands how to go on errands now.

2113
01:34:49,760 --> 01:34:52,230
Will he be fine?

2114
01:34:50,900 --> 01:34:52,500
Also how to pay.

2115
01:34:52,500 --> 01:34:55,440
And the names of various products.

2116
01:34:55,440 --> 01:34:58,240
Alright and today it's collagen, right?

2117
01:34:58,240 --> 01:35:01,510
Chicken thighs, please.

2118
01:35:01,510 --> 01:35:06,650
During the training his father made him buy chicken thighs.

2119
01:35:03,810 --> 01:35:06,410
Changed to chicken thighs.

2120
01:35:06,410 --> 01:35:08,410
How come?

2121
01:35:07,510 --> 01:35:09,880
Even though he was finally able to say collagen.

2122
01:35:10,550 --> 01:35:11,850
Please repeat it.

2123
01:35:11,850 --> 01:35:14,050
Chicken thighs.

2124
01:35:14,050 --> 01:35:15,090
Thighs?

2125
01:35:15,760 --> 01:35:18,520
This is a pork specialty butcher.

2126
01:35:18,520 --> 01:35:23,500
She thought he confused it with pork thighs so that's what she gave him.

2127
01:35:25,360 --> 01:35:28,740
He's watching it all from here.

2128
01:35:27,770 --> 01:35:30,070
Mama, open up please.

2129
01:35:28,740 --> 01:35:30,070
You can enter.

2130
01:35:30,070 --> 01:35:33,170
What did you purchase?

2131
01:35:31,270 --> 01:35:33,170
Chicken thighs.

2132
01:35:33,170 --> 01:35:36,180
No no, it's meat from pig legs.

2133
01:35:36,180 --> 01:35:38,310
Mao, are you having fun?

2134
01:35:38,310 --> 01:35:38,910
Yeah.

2135
01:35:38,910 --> 01:35:41,610
I understand you are having fun but

2136
01:35:42,120 --> 01:35:43,120
Mao.

2137
01:35:43,120 --> 01:35:46,590
You want to get it for papa, right?

2138
01:35:45,590 --> 01:35:47,950
- He's not listening.

2139
01:35:46,650 --> 01:35:47,950
- He's not listening.

2140
01:35:48,150 --> 01:35:51,560
I am about to get mad. Listen to what I am telling you.

2141
01:35:51,090 --> 01:35:53,560
There it is. That's right.

2142
01:35:52,460 --> 01:35:54,430
Come here.

2143
01:35:54,630 --> 01:35:56,200
She's getting mad.

2144
01:35:56,630 --> 01:35:59,500
She can get really scary during those times.

2145
01:35:59,570 --> 01:36:01,670
When he does things half-hearted

2146
01:36:01,670 --> 01:36:03,170
she will get mad.

2147
01:36:03,170 --> 01:36:04,900
I like that about her.

2148
01:36:04,900 --> 01:36:07,110
I want her to get mad more often but...

2149
01:36:07,110 --> 01:36:10,680
The mother isn't ordinary either.

2150
01:36:10,040 --> 01:36:12,040
I see.

2151
01:36:10,680 --> 01:36:15,280
She's a top athlete who aimed for the olympics in badminton.

2152
01:36:15,280 --> 01:36:17,950
But she retired when they married

2153
01:36:17,950 --> 01:36:21,220
and she continued fighting for victory as a mother.

2154
01:36:21,420 --> 01:36:27,860
But when it comes to raising her son she's lenient with him.

2155
01:36:27,860 --> 01:36:34,900
He's 3 but I still see him as a baby.

2156
01:36:34,900 --> 01:36:36,300
I mean

2157
01:36:36,300 --> 01:36:39,210
He's just like a miniature of this.

2158
01:36:40,740 --> 01:36:42,240
Which is cuter.

2159
01:36:42,310 --> 01:36:45,680
You're losing out.

2160
01:36:45,780 --> 01:36:46,550
Collagen.

2161
01:36:46,550 --> 01:36:47,750
Collagen.

2162
01:36:47,850 --> 01:36:50,580
Another try for collagen.

2163
01:36:50,580 --> 01:36:51,450
You can do it!

2164
01:36:54,090 --> 01:36:54,850
Go!

2165
01:36:55,050 --> 01:36:57,760
He's walking weird this time.

2166
01:36:57,760 --> 01:36:58,660
Collagen.

2167
01:36:58,660 --> 01:36:59,960
Collagen.

2168
01:36:59,960 --> 01:37:01,960
Collagen.

2169
01:37:00,580 --> 01:37:02,740
He's messing around.

2170
01:37:02,760 --> 01:37:03,860
Collagen.

2171
01:37:03,860 --> 01:37:05,830
Collagen.

2172
01:37:05,830 --> 01:37:07,600
Collagen.

2173
01:37:06,870 --> 01:37:09,100
He's gonna get something different.

2174
01:37:08,200 --> 01:37:09,900
Collagen.

2175
01:37:09,170 --> 01:37:13,320
That's unfair. She's saying it with him all the way to the shop door.

2176
01:37:10,970 --> 01:37:12,000
Collagen.

2177
01:37:12,000 --> 01:37:13,440
Collagen.

2178
01:37:13,440 --> 01:37:15,940
This time he can't forget, right?

2179
01:37:15,940 --> 01:37:18,240
Since he's already at the shop.

2180
01:37:17,380 --> 01:37:19,750
Right at the shop.

2181
01:37:19,010 --> 01:37:20,380
Collagen.

2182
01:37:20,380 --> 01:37:21,280
Collagen.

2183
01:37:24,950 --> 01:37:27,990
Collagen, please.

2184
01:37:27,990 --> 01:37:29,590
He was finally able to say it.

2185
01:37:29,590 --> 01:37:32,120
Please repeat it again.

2186
01:37:32,120 --> 01:37:34,960
Collagen, please.

2187
01:37:33,890 --> 01:37:34,960
Collagen?

2188
01:37:35,090 --> 01:37:36,000
Yep.

2189
01:37:36,000 --> 01:37:38,160
Collagen soup base?

2190
01:37:38,160 --> 01:37:39,070
Yep.

2191
01:37:39,170 --> 01:37:41,330
Amazing. How nice.

2192
01:37:41,330 --> 01:37:43,100
No no no.

2193
01:37:43,100 --> 01:37:46,010
It's like moms wish made its way there.

2194
01:37:46,010 --> 01:37:49,340
Not only her wish but also her love has made it there.

2195
01:37:50,140 --> 01:37:52,210
I will take 100 yen.

2196
01:37:52,210 --> 01:37:56,250
He paid for it. His mother will be delighted.

2197
01:37:56,580 --> 01:38:00,650
I bought collagen.

2198
01:37:58,680 --> 01:38:00,650
You bought it?

2199
01:37:58,750 --> 01:38:01,020
Finally.

2200
01:38:00,650 --> 01:38:04,520
Thank you. You really helped me out.

2201
01:38:04,520 --> 01:38:06,330
To buy a mere collagen bag

2202
01:38:06,330 --> 01:38:08,960
it still took 34 minutes.

2203
01:38:08,960 --> 01:38:14,430
But his father is surprised by his sons development in these 34 minutes.

2204
01:38:14,430 --> 01:38:20,340
His development since he became 3 years old has been remarkable.

2205
01:38:22,140 --> 01:38:29,420
It's like he is breaking out of his shell.

2206
01:38:29,550 --> 01:38:32,650
Changing from a baby into a boy.

2207
01:38:32,650 --> 01:38:35,920
I want him to come out fast.

2208
01:38:35,920 --> 01:38:38,160
To be able to accomplish anything.

2209
01:38:38,160 --> 01:38:40,690
And become a boy who isn't prone to crying.

2210
01:38:41,830 --> 01:38:43,660
40 minutes have passed.

2211
01:38:43,660 --> 01:38:46,570
Time for a player substitution in the second-half.

2212
01:38:46,570 --> 01:38:51,340
Tanaka papa will switch with the mother and challenge Mao to a new errand.

2213
01:38:51,340 --> 01:38:53,340
This time it's further away.

2214
01:38:52,470 --> 01:38:54,210
Bye bye Mao.

2215
01:38:53,140 --> 01:38:55,270
Mao can you help out?

2216
01:38:54,210 --> 01:38:55,270
Yep.

2217
01:38:55,270 --> 01:38:56,340
What to get.

2218
01:38:56,480 --> 01:39:00,050
My favorite food is?

2219
01:38:57,310 --> 01:39:00,050
The errand is to get food that his father likes.

2220
01:39:00,050 --> 01:39:02,720
Chicken Nanban.

2221
01:39:00,050 --> 01:39:05,050
Chicken Nanban: fried chicken with vinegar and tartar sauce​

2222
01:39:01,050 --> 01:39:02,720
Chicken Nanban.

2223
01:39:02,720 --> 01:39:07,990
What type of meat is needed for it?

2224
01:39:05,580 --> 01:39:07,990
Chicken thighs.

2225
01:39:07,990 --> 01:39:10,600
Let's make a dance to help you remember.

2226
01:39:09,360 --> 01:39:11,360
Chi-ck-en thi-gh-s.

2227
01:39:11,360 --> 01:39:13,130
Hey hey hey.

2228
01:39:13,130 --> 01:39:15,960
Chicken thighs.

2229
01:39:14,560 --> 01:39:15,960
Nice. You dance well.

2230
01:39:16,060 --> 01:39:18,200
Chicken thighs, right?

2231
01:39:18,200 --> 01:39:20,200
Not enough.

2232
01:39:20,200 --> 01:39:24,300
That's right. Chicken thighs. We don't have enough.

2233
01:39:22,700 --> 01:39:24,300
And one more ingredient.

2234
01:39:24,670 --> 01:39:27,470
What vegetable looks like my face?

2235
01:39:27,470 --> 01:39:28,540
Which is pea green.

2236
01:39:28,540 --> 01:39:31,580
Cabbage.

2237
01:39:29,180 --> 01:39:31,580
That's right. Just like my...

2238
01:39:31,580 --> 01:39:34,580
Like the size of my face. Cabbage.

2239
01:39:34,710 --> 01:39:37,080
Cabbage which looks like his fathers face.

2240
01:39:37,080 --> 01:39:40,320
We are lacking it today.

2241
01:39:38,580 --> 01:39:40,320
Lacking in cabbage.

2242
01:39:40,320 --> 01:39:41,950
Lacking in cabbage.

2243
01:39:42,520 --> 01:39:45,520
It's clever to use his body to help him remember.

2244
01:39:45,520 --> 01:39:47,190
What do you think, mother.

2245
01:39:47,190 --> 01:39:50,400
He's becoming hyper.

2246
01:39:50,400 --> 01:39:51,930
Is that not good?

2247
01:39:52,230 --> 01:39:55,570
Chicken thighs. Thump. What is it?

2248
01:39:55,570 --> 01:39:57,500
Chicken thighs.

2249
01:39:57,500 --> 01:40:00,370
Cabbage too. Thump.

2250
01:40:01,470 --> 01:40:05,410
But cabbages are big.

2251
01:40:03,240 --> 01:40:05,410
They are big but they have entered your head.

2252
01:40:05,410 --> 01:40:07,680
And the third item, mayonnaise, have entered too.

2253
01:40:07,680 --> 01:40:09,720
He's also getting mayonnaise?

2254
01:40:09,720 --> 01:40:11,720
For the tartar sauce.

2255
01:40:11,920 --> 01:40:16,390
Alright Mao, this is a good luck charm.

2256
01:40:16,390 --> 01:40:21,130
He should be more direct.

2257
01:40:17,990 --> 01:40:21,130
And now the mother is going to coach him.

2258
01:40:21,130 --> 01:40:23,130
Is she mad?

2259
01:40:23,860 --> 01:40:25,530
Please wait, it's mama.

2260
01:40:25,530 --> 01:40:26,600
Hello.

2261
01:40:26,600 --> 01:40:27,430
Hello.

2262
01:40:27,430 --> 01:40:31,300
I think it's dangerous to let Mao out when he gets this hyper.

2263
01:40:31,300 --> 01:40:34,740
And because he's hyper...

2264
01:40:31,640 --> 01:40:33,240
So strict.

2265
01:40:34,770 --> 01:40:38,180
Please change your tone a bit

2266
01:40:38,180 --> 01:40:41,050
and tell him he needs to do it seriously.

2267
01:40:41,050 --> 01:40:42,950
And don't forget to put his jacket on.

2268
01:40:42,950 --> 01:40:44,420
Oh, that's right.

2269
01:40:44,420 --> 01:40:45,820
Yes, I apologize.

2270
01:40:45,450 --> 01:40:48,150
Come on, now.

2271
01:40:48,550 --> 01:40:51,990
She knows it won't go well if he's in a playful mood.

2272
01:40:52,190 --> 01:40:54,060
Mao.

2273
01:40:54,060 --> 01:40:56,060
Please listen seriously.

2274
01:40:56,230 --> 01:40:59,270
To turn him in a serious state of mind.

2275
01:40:59,930 --> 01:41:01,530
Stand to attention. Beep.

2276
01:41:01,530 --> 01:41:04,740
Papa he always does his best in rugby, right?

2277
01:41:04,740 --> 01:41:06,940
And in order to do my training

2278
01:41:06,940 --> 01:41:07,870
I want to

2279
01:41:07,870 --> 01:41:11,610
eat mama's cooking today

2280
01:41:11,610 --> 01:41:13,610
and do my best in tomorrows training.

2281
01:41:13,610 --> 01:41:15,610
He has training camp starting tomorrow.

2282
01:41:15,610 --> 01:41:17,120
Mao, you are a boy.

2283
01:41:17,120 --> 01:41:18,650
Yes.

2284
01:41:18,650 --> 01:41:20,650
That's why

2285
01:41:20,650 --> 01:41:22,760
I expect you to help us out properly.

2286
01:41:22,820 --> 01:41:24,320
Yeah.

2287
01:41:24,320 --> 01:41:25,290
Can you do it?

2288
01:41:25,290 --> 01:41:26,890
Yeah.

2289
01:41:26,890 --> 01:41:30,360
Papa believes in you, Mao.

2290
01:41:28,460 --> 01:41:30,360
His mood changed.

2291
01:41:30,360 --> 01:41:30,930
Yes.

2292
01:41:30,930 --> 01:41:35,670
This is the wristband that I always wear during matches.

2293
01:41:36,800 --> 01:41:39,870
Mao feels like a Japanese representative.

2294
01:41:39,310 --> 01:41:41,740
He looks so happy.

2295
01:41:41,970 --> 01:41:45,780
Papa will always protect you.

2296
01:41:46,280 --> 01:41:49,620
He's getting ingredients for chicken Nanban.

2297
01:41:49,620 --> 01:41:56,820
Chicken thighs, cabbage and mayonnaise for the tartar sauce is what he needs to get.

2298
01:41:57,160 --> 01:41:58,090
Off you go.

2299
01:41:58,090 --> 01:41:59,530
Yes.

2300
01:41:59,530 --> 01:42:01,730
Please do your best.

2301
01:42:00,290 --> 01:42:01,730
Okay.

2302
01:42:01,730 --> 01:42:02,960
Off you go.

2303
01:42:02,960 --> 01:42:04,630
Off I go.

2304
01:42:04,630 --> 01:42:06,200
Bye bye.

2305
01:42:05,200 --> 01:42:06,200
Do your best.

2306
01:42:06,200 --> 01:42:07,430
Bye.

2307
01:42:12,100 --> 01:42:13,670
He started sprinting.

2308
01:42:17,180 --> 01:42:20,780
His mother is peeking out from the blinds.

2309
01:42:20,780 --> 01:42:23,150
He's not long within sight.

2310
01:42:21,780 --> 01:42:23,150
Yes, he's not long within sight.

2311
01:42:23,150 --> 01:42:26,120
He started running the moment before I lost sight of him.

2312
01:42:26,520 --> 01:42:28,020
What is their state of mind?

2313
01:42:28,020 --> 01:42:31,960
I feel anxious when I can't see him. At least over there I could still see him.

2314
01:42:32,360 --> 01:42:34,290
And I didn't feel anxious.

2315
01:42:34,290 --> 01:42:37,330
I'm about to cry.

2316
01:42:37,330 --> 01:42:38,930
You are really on the verge.

2317
01:42:38,930 --> 01:42:41,800
I can feel his amazing growth.

2318
01:42:41,800 --> 01:42:45,500
Just previously it was the collagen thing.

2319
01:42:45,970 --> 01:42:48,040
Isn't it amazing?

2320
01:42:46,810 --> 01:42:48,040
It's amazing.

2321
01:42:48,040 --> 01:42:52,080
That he didn't complain and said that he can go.

2322
01:42:57,820 --> 01:43:03,460
His big sister is the one who taught him how to shop only 11 days ago.

2323
01:43:03,460 --> 01:43:04,790
There's no natto.

2324
01:43:06,090 --> 01:43:10,500
Mao, who didn't want to go, and as soon as his sister let go of him...

2325
01:43:10,500 --> 01:43:12,100
This was his state.

2326
01:43:11,530 --> 01:43:13,430
Amazing.

2327
01:43:12,100 --> 01:43:15,600
And they wondered if he could be relied on.

2328
01:43:16,370 --> 01:43:19,870
But in no time he has changed.

2329
01:43:19,870 --> 01:43:23,880
He has always done the railway crossing training with great joy.

2330
01:43:26,350 --> 01:43:29,180
Since he loves trains.

2331
01:43:30,180 --> 01:43:33,290
Unfortunately he's not seeing trains today.

2332
01:43:35,650 --> 01:43:40,760
Oh, it's passing behind him but he's not noticing cause he's on an errand.

2333
01:43:57,440 --> 01:44:00,080
Moments before in front of your eyes

2334
01:44:00,080 --> 01:44:04,420
is now a boy who just bought collagen.

2335
01:44:04,050 --> 01:44:05,520
That's right.

2336
01:44:05,620 --> 01:44:08,490
He has arrived at the large supermarket.

2337
01:44:08,490 --> 01:44:10,760
Poultry, cabbage and mayonnaise.

2338
01:44:10,920 --> 01:44:13,230
Take the children sized basket.

2339
01:44:13,230 --> 01:44:14,960
Will he remember?

2340
01:44:16,660 --> 01:44:19,370
Where are the vegetables?

2341
01:44:18,430 --> 01:44:20,200
That's great.

2342
01:44:19,370 --> 01:44:21,330
Vegetables.

2343
01:44:20,070 --> 01:44:21,330
Vegetables?

2344
01:44:21,330 --> 01:44:24,440
I will take you there.

2345
01:44:22,330 --> 01:44:24,440
The vegetable that is pea green.

2346
01:44:24,440 --> 01:44:25,370
The pea green one?

2347
01:44:25,370 --> 01:44:27,640
The pea green what?

2348
01:44:26,570 --> 01:44:27,640
There are so many.

2349
01:44:27,640 --> 01:44:30,910
Here and over there you can find pea green ones.

2350
01:44:30,910 --> 01:44:33,080
Is this pea green?

2351
01:44:33,080 --> 01:44:34,110
This is lettuce.

2352
01:44:34,750 --> 01:44:37,620
Isn't this much smaller than his fathers head?

2353
01:44:37,620 --> 01:44:39,450
And what else do you need to get?

2354
01:44:40,190 --> 01:44:42,760
Meat from chicken thighs.

2355
01:44:42,760 --> 01:44:43,990
Meat from chicken thighs?

2356
01:44:44,860 --> 01:44:48,660
He has memorized "chicken thighs".

2357
01:44:48,660 --> 01:44:51,960
It's the most important ingredient in chicken Nanban.

2358
01:44:52,060 --> 01:44:56,640
What will you make today?

2359
01:44:54,100 --> 01:44:56,640
Meat from chicken thighs and...

2360
01:44:56,640 --> 01:44:58,670
Pea green vegetable.

2361
01:44:58,670 --> 01:44:59,970
Pea green?

2362
01:45:00,270 --> 01:45:05,380
The fact that he could say chicken thighs but didn't say lettuce made the store assistant concerned.

2363
01:45:05,380 --> 01:45:07,580
What an amazing shop assistant.

2364
01:45:06,710 --> 01:45:08,650
Is it lettuce or cabbage?

2365
01:45:08,010 --> 01:45:09,480
Amazing.

2366
01:45:09,110 --> 01:45:12,790
Small children always confuse lettuce and cabbage.

2367
01:45:12,790 --> 01:45:14,850
Is he getting both?

2368
01:45:14,450 --> 01:45:15,720
Gonna be heavy.

2369
01:45:15,720 --> 01:45:17,290
Huh, what about daikon?

2370
01:45:17,290 --> 01:45:19,090
He was not asked to get daikon.

2371
01:45:19,790 --> 01:45:21,560
You are also getting daikon?

2372
01:45:21,560 --> 01:45:22,700
Heavy.

2373
01:45:22,330 --> 01:45:24,800
Heavy.

2374
01:45:22,700 --> 01:45:24,300
He's also getting daikon?

2375
01:45:24,300 --> 01:45:27,430
You can't carry this huge thing.

2376
01:45:25,530 --> 01:45:27,430
I can.

2377
01:45:27,530 --> 01:45:30,140
You can't carry it all.

2378
01:45:29,200 --> 01:45:33,710
The shop assistant is worried that he was not asked to get all these things for the errand.

2379
01:45:33,710 --> 01:45:36,010
Mao will carry this.

2380
01:45:36,010 --> 01:45:38,480
You will carry it?

2381
01:45:39,210 --> 01:45:41,610
He's carrying it like a rugby ball.

2382
01:45:42,310 --> 01:45:46,890
Cabbage or lettuce. Which one is it?

2383
01:45:43,950 --> 01:45:45,280
Lettuce.

2384
01:45:45,280 --> 01:45:47,280
This is...

2385
01:45:47,650 --> 01:45:48,490
Which one?

2386
01:45:48,490 --> 01:45:51,420
Which one is his fathers head.

2387
01:45:51,760 --> 01:45:54,390
The one like my father...

2388
01:45:52,730 --> 01:45:54,390
Is it this one?

2389
01:45:54,390 --> 01:45:55,830
He choose the cabbage.

2390
01:45:56,700 --> 01:45:59,500
He completely forgot the mayonnaise.

2391
01:45:59,970 --> 01:46:04,270
He prefers it to be heavy. That way he's guaranteed praises from his father.

2392
01:46:04,870 --> 01:46:07,340
But will he be okay?

2393
01:46:06,910 --> 01:46:09,070
Heavy. Heavy.

2394
01:46:09,270 --> 01:46:10,410
So tough.

2395
01:46:13,280 --> 01:46:17,150
The assistant to the shop manager ran over to help.

2396
01:46:17,150 --> 01:46:21,190
The cabbage fits perfectly in the ladybug. I see.

2397
01:46:21,190 --> 01:46:24,420
His father thought of everything.

2398
01:46:24,920 --> 01:46:26,360
Bye bye.

2399
01:46:31,960 --> 01:46:34,600
The chicken meat is also in his bag.

2400
01:46:34,600 --> 01:46:37,970
In his hands is the daikon he wasn't asked to get.

2401
01:46:52,520 --> 01:46:56,160
And this is how it usually ends with the daikon.

2402
01:46:57,520 --> 01:47:00,230
This is what happens.

2403
01:46:59,560 --> 01:47:01,190
He's dragging it.

2404
01:47:01,790 --> 01:47:03,190
Oh no no.

2405
01:47:04,400 --> 01:47:06,230
A gravel road.

2406
01:47:07,700 --> 01:47:09,030
No good.

2407
01:47:09,970 --> 01:47:11,600
Do your best.

2408
01:47:10,500 --> 01:47:12,340
He lifted it.

2409
01:47:12,340 --> 01:47:14,840
It's popping out.

2410
01:47:13,370 --> 01:47:15,610
Saved it from severe damage.

2411
01:47:15,610 --> 01:47:17,480
It's popping out.

2412
01:47:24,520 --> 01:47:25,920
A train.

2413
01:47:27,350 --> 01:47:29,050
Waah, hurry.

2414
01:47:29,050 --> 01:47:30,560
The train is coming.

2415
01:47:30,560 --> 01:47:32,190
Hurry. The train is co...

2416
01:47:32,190 --> 01:47:35,730
He can still run with the daikon.

2417
01:47:36,400 --> 01:47:41,530
No reason for the staff to be worried. He's watching from a distance and with composure.

2418
01:47:41,530 --> 01:47:44,900
He really loves trains.

2419
01:47:44,370 --> 01:47:46,070
He's waving at it.

2420
01:47:49,170 --> 01:47:52,980
After this crossing he's almost home.

2421
01:47:57,950 --> 01:47:59,820
Another.

2422
01:47:58,250 --> 01:47:59,820
Another train.

2423
01:48:01,950 --> 01:48:03,760
Hurry.

2424
01:48:03,760 --> 01:48:06,290
He's going back to the tracks?

2425
01:48:06,290 --> 01:48:09,290
That poor daikon is on a journey.

2426
01:48:22,740 --> 01:48:25,410
We underestimated him.

2427
01:48:25,410 --> 01:48:29,110
With a height of 94 cm and a weight of 13 kg.

2428
01:48:32,150 --> 01:48:33,950
Without fail

2429
01:48:33,950 --> 01:48:38,860
this small giant is walking with all his might.

2430
01:48:44,700 --> 01:48:49,200
The Mao who has returned has the face of a boy.

2431
01:48:49,800 --> 01:48:52,540
Mao.

2432
01:48:52,770 --> 01:48:55,110
Do your best.

2433
01:49:02,650 --> 01:49:04,350
I'm home.

2434
01:49:04,050 --> 01:49:06,350
He did it.

2435
01:49:05,350 --> 01:49:06,950
Welcome back.

2436
01:49:08,020 --> 01:49:11,320
A try (rugby move) into his fathers arms.

2437
01:49:11,320 --> 01:49:13,060
You did your best.

2438
01:49:13,060 --> 01:49:14,390
You properly...

2439
01:49:14,390 --> 01:49:16,760
Thank you. You bought it?

2440
01:49:15,490 --> 01:49:16,760
Here is...

2441
01:49:16,760 --> 01:49:19,400
A hole.

2442
01:49:19,400 --> 01:49:22,030
The plastic bag also did its best.

2443
01:49:22,030 --> 01:49:24,840
It was able to bring the daikon all the way home.

2444
01:49:25,740 --> 01:49:26,470
However...

2445
01:49:28,870 --> 01:49:30,210
Why did you buy daikon?

2446
01:49:30,540 --> 01:49:33,350
Let me see...

2447
01:49:34,180 --> 01:49:36,720
Bought it since they had daikon available.

2448
01:49:36,720 --> 01:49:38,120
Since it was available?

2449
01:49:38,120 --> 01:49:38,680
Yeah.

2450
01:49:39,520 --> 01:49:41,290
Thank you.

2451
01:49:40,450 --> 01:49:42,390
No problem.

2452
01:49:41,290 --> 01:49:42,390
Let's also eat daikon.

2453
01:49:43,690 --> 01:49:45,420
Focus. Focus.

2454
01:49:45,420 --> 01:49:48,790
The father said: "Let's make grated daikon."

2455
01:49:49,800 --> 01:49:51,330
And the chicken Nanban

2456
01:49:51,330 --> 01:49:56,740
is a nostalgic Japanese taste his wife made when his team went to New Zealand.

2457
01:49:57,000 --> 01:50:01,470
Since he didn't purchase mayonaise they made ponzu mixed with grated daikon.

2458
01:50:00,670 --> 01:50:02,310
I see.

2459
01:50:03,080 --> 01:50:05,410
They made soup pasta with the collagen.

2460
01:50:05,410 --> 01:50:07,210
Thanks for the meal.

2461
01:50:07,610 --> 01:50:10,650
Todays chicken Nanban is exceptional.

2462
01:50:10,650 --> 01:50:11,680
Delicious.

2463
01:50:11,680 --> 01:50:13,320
Mao.

2464
01:50:13,690 --> 01:50:14,750
It's really delicious.

2465
01:50:14,750 --> 01:50:17,320
The collagen was hard to get.

2466
01:50:17,320 --> 01:50:18,490
The pasta is good.

2467
01:50:18,790 --> 01:50:22,960
Wanna try the daikon you bought, Mao?

2468
01:50:25,060 --> 01:50:28,230
It's what you bought Mao.

2469
01:50:28,230 --> 01:50:31,200
It's an acquired taste after all.

2470
01:50:34,240 --> 01:50:35,940
That was funny.

2471
01:50:35,940 --> 01:50:37,010
Yeah.

2472
01:50:37,010 --> 01:50:39,650
It's like a short movie.

2473
01:50:38,240 --> 01:50:39,650
That's right.

2474
01:50:39,650 --> 01:50:43,680
That was quite something. He went so many times.

2475
01:50:43,680 --> 01:50:45,380
That's right.

2476
01:50:45,380 --> 01:50:48,450
His expression changed moment by moment.

2477
01:50:48,450 --> 01:50:52,690
The pride felt from having a duty.

2478
01:50:53,790 --> 01:50:56,460
How he went to the butcher in front of his house

2479
01:50:56,460 --> 01:50:59,330
and to think they went with the supermarket right after.

2480
01:50:57,700 --> 01:50:59,330
That's indeed unusual.

2481
01:50:59,730 --> 01:51:03,670
The way his father made him remember in a fun way with his body.

2482
01:51:03,670 --> 01:51:06,870
That was spectacular. We are like two peas in a pod.

2483
01:51:06,870 --> 01:51:09,880
I also do that to easily remember things.

2484
01:51:09,880 --> 01:51:11,540
When I try to remember.

2485
01:51:11,540 --> 01:51:15,350
But while it works for me the mother said: "No good".

2486
01:51:15,350 --> 01:51:17,120
And then he was like: "I'm sorry."

2487
01:51:17,120 --> 01:51:22,190
And after that his expression changed  instantly.

2488
01:51:19,250 --> 01:51:22,190
Like a switch being flipped.

2489
01:51:22,250 --> 01:51:24,190
And for our next errand...

2490
01:51:24,190 --> 01:51:29,530
An errand with a strict code and a warm embrace.

2491
01:51:30,230 --> 01:51:33,930
Fukushima ● Aizuwakamatsu

2492
01:51:30,530 --> 01:51:33,930
The thing that everyone knows in Aizuwakamatsu city.

2493
01:51:33,930 --> 01:51:36,900
Here the kids in primary school

2494
01:51:36,900 --> 01:51:41,310
have to follow a strict code.

2495
01:51:41,540 --> 01:51:44,110
The Aizukko Code

2496
01:51:44,110 --> 01:51:46,750
This is the Aizukko Code.

2497
01:51:44,110 --> 01:51:52,110
Specific to the town of Aizuwakamatsu.

2498
01:51:46,880 --> 01:51:48,180
What? What?

2499
01:51:48,180 --> 01:51:49,850
Empathize with people.

2500
01:51:49,850 --> 01:51:52,220
Say thank you and sorry.

2501
01:51:52,220 --> 01:51:54,820
Persevere and more.

2502
01:51:55,550 --> 01:51:57,960
Even when adults look at it, their backs straighten up.

2503
01:51:58,090 --> 01:52:01,890
Do what you must. Don't do what you must not.

2504
01:52:01,890 --> 01:52:05,660
The things you should not do, you must not do.

2505
01:52:04,830 --> 01:52:06,830
How wonderful.

2506
01:52:06,430 --> 01:52:12,100
Since the time of Byakkotai samurai the rules have been continuously passed down for the children.

2507
01:52:12,100 --> 01:52:17,880
When you ask both adults and children in this area their backs straighten up.

2508
01:52:18,510 --> 01:52:23,780
It is not just history, it is the honored code.

2509
01:52:24,580 --> 01:52:29,860
And when he breaks the code this boy immediately bursts into tears.

2510
01:52:29,860 --> 01:52:33,130
The youngest child, Yuuto, and his two sisters.

2511
01:52:30,890 --> 01:52:35,060
Oldest daughter

2512
01:52:30,890 --> 01:52:35,060
Second daughter

2513
01:52:30,890 --> 01:52:41,000
Yuuto

2514
01:52:33,130 --> 01:52:37,300
Before his bedtime his parents used to read him the declaration.

2515
01:52:37,000 --> 01:52:41,000
Father

2516
01:52:37,000 --> 01:52:41,000
Mother

2517
01:52:37,000 --> 01:52:41,000
Oldest daughter

2518
01:52:37,000 --> 01:52:41,000
Second daughter

2519
01:52:37,300 --> 01:52:41,000
And as he grew up he came to remember it by heart.

2520
01:52:41,270 --> 01:52:45,970
Having pride in Aizu town and listening to the elders.

2521
01:52:45,970 --> 01:52:49,470
Do what you must. Don't do what you must not.

2522
01:52:49,470 --> 01:52:52,710
The things you should not do, you must not do.

2523
01:52:52,710 --> 01:52:54,280
Though he still can't read.

2524
01:52:55,350 --> 01:52:58,950
The samurai Yuuto. He's been getting energetic since moments ago.

2525
01:52:59,950 --> 01:53:01,520
Yuuto please answer it.

2526
01:53:01,520 --> 01:53:02,920
Hey hey.

2527
01:53:03,460 --> 01:53:04,790
Remember to say "hello".

2528
01:53:04,790 --> 01:53:05,960
Hello hello.

2529
01:53:05,960 --> 01:53:07,690
It's his sister in primary school.

2530
01:53:06,660 --> 01:53:10,560
Memo

2531
01:53:07,690 --> 01:53:10,560
She is reading the script her mother gave her.

2532
01:53:10,560 --> 01:53:15,170
I forgot something at home so can you get mom?

2533
01:53:15,430 --> 01:53:17,800
She said that she forgot something.

2534
01:53:17,800 --> 01:53:21,710
She usually does forget but today it's just an act.

2535
01:53:21,910 --> 01:53:25,240
I forgot my sheet music so please bring it.

2536
01:53:25,240 --> 01:53:26,880
I see.

2537
01:53:26,880 --> 01:53:28,010
Just like in the script.

2538
01:53:28,010 --> 01:53:29,110
Yuuto, this is bad.

2539
01:53:29,110 --> 01:53:30,020
Um?

2540
01:53:30,020 --> 01:53:32,550
Momo said she forgot her sheet music.

2541
01:53:32,550 --> 01:53:35,620
Is it there? Can you take a look?

2542
01:53:35,620 --> 01:53:39,660
She uses them to practice the piano with her mother.

2543
01:53:39,660 --> 01:53:45,160
Found it. It's the sheet music that she uses to practice for the choir class.

2544
01:53:43,960 --> 01:53:45,830
That's not good.

2545
01:53:45,460 --> 01:53:46,530
Oh no.

2546
01:53:46,530 --> 01:53:49,400
Since it's noon we better hurry or it will be too late.

2547
01:53:49,400 --> 01:53:54,240
The 4th period ends at 12:05. There's more than 1 hour left.

2548
01:53:54,810 --> 01:53:56,810
I want you to take it there, Yuuto.

2549
01:53:56,810 --> 01:53:59,880
Will Yuuto go all by himself?

2550
01:53:59,880 --> 01:54:02,310
Because you should "do what you must", please do your best.

2551
01:54:02,310 --> 01:54:04,680
The code says: "Do what you must."

2552
01:54:04,680 --> 01:54:06,680
Please go, okay?

2553
01:54:05,150 --> 01:54:06,680
He won't cry.

2554
01:54:07,220 --> 01:54:08,420
Splendid.

2555
01:54:08,420 --> 01:54:09,090
Please wait.

2556
01:54:09,090 --> 01:54:12,390
You shouldn't go inside the school wearing a raincoat and drenched.

2557
01:54:12,460 --> 01:54:15,960
When I enter and take off my raincoat I should wipe myself with a towel.

2558
01:54:15,960 --> 01:54:16,960
Splendid.

2559
01:54:17,830 --> 01:54:19,700
Must do what I must.

2560
01:54:17,830 --> 01:54:19,700
That's right.

2561
01:54:19,700 --> 01:54:21,130
Isn't it "Do what I must"?

2562
01:54:21,130 --> 01:54:24,970
Things you must do and things you must not. It's difficult.

2563
01:54:25,170 --> 01:54:28,040
Since you should do what you must. Please do your best.

2564
01:54:28,040 --> 01:54:29,840
I will be waiting for you.

2565
01:54:30,280 --> 01:54:33,850
His sister also goes to her primary school by foot

2566
01:54:33,850 --> 01:54:41,890
but worried about Yuuto his mother found a route that has fewer cars passing by.

2567
01:54:42,290 --> 01:54:43,520
Yuuto, you are capable.

2568
01:54:43,520 --> 01:54:45,090
She also believes in Aizukko.

2569
01:54:45,090 --> 01:54:46,760
Will you fine going this way?

2570
01:54:46,760 --> 01:54:50,200
They have set up the premise for Yuuto's errand.

2571
01:54:50,200 --> 01:54:51,260
Off you go.

2572
01:54:51,260 --> 01:54:53,700
Off I go.

2573
01:54:55,170 --> 01:54:58,700
The youngest of a 4 generation 10 people big family.

2574
01:54:58,700 --> 01:55:01,440
Until now, everyone has done everything for him.

2575
01:55:02,340 --> 01:55:05,340
Sometimes shy, prone to crying and frights.

2576
01:55:06,080 --> 01:55:07,340
However...

2577
01:55:08,010 --> 01:55:12,520
He knows that today he must "do what he must".

2578
01:55:12,950 --> 01:55:15,120
I better hurry.

2579
01:55:15,120 --> 01:55:17,790
He should hand it to her during lunch.

2580
01:55:19,160 --> 01:55:22,030
I better go.

2581
01:55:22,360 --> 01:55:24,300
I better go.

2582
01:55:24,300 --> 01:55:26,830
To Momoka. For Momoka.

2583
01:55:26,830 --> 01:55:30,600
Because she forgot the sheet music.

2584
01:55:29,270 --> 01:55:31,330
Remarkable.

2585
01:55:30,600 --> 01:55:32,600
Don't do what you must not.

2586
01:55:33,640 --> 01:55:35,410
Is our school really

2587
01:55:35,410 --> 01:55:36,980
all this way?

2588
01:55:36,980 --> 01:55:42,250
That's right. It's 2 km one-way. 4 both ways.

2589
01:55:41,010 --> 01:55:43,350
Is that right?

2590
01:55:42,250 --> 01:55:43,520
That much?

2591
01:55:44,120 --> 01:55:46,120
Thank you.

2592
01:55:46,120 --> 01:55:49,650
He's been told that he has to cross like this when he enters primary school.

2593
01:55:49,650 --> 01:55:52,390
His mother has been training him.

2594
01:55:52,720 --> 01:55:56,460
Momo is in her first year and has 2 years to go.

2595
01:55:56,460 --> 01:55:58,400
The shy Yuuto.

2596
01:55:58,730 --> 01:56:01,230
Can he approach the reception?

2597
01:56:02,900 --> 01:56:04,500
Good day.

2598
01:56:04,500 --> 01:56:06,340
He was able to.

2599
01:56:05,200 --> 01:56:06,640
Excellent.

2600
01:56:07,110 --> 01:56:09,070
This is Momo's...

2601
01:56:07,270 --> 01:56:09,070
Good day.

2602
01:56:09,070 --> 01:56:10,880
Mo...

2603
01:56:09,570 --> 01:56:10,880
What's up?

2604
01:56:10,880 --> 01:56:12,810
The third year student Momo

2605
01:56:12,810 --> 01:56:15,350
I brought her the thing she forgot.

2606
01:56:15,350 --> 01:56:18,550
Right now she's in a class

2607
01:56:18,550 --> 01:56:21,590
but I will open it for you. Please wait.

2608
01:56:21,920 --> 01:56:24,120
He arrived 30 minutes before time.

2609
01:56:23,760 --> 01:56:25,760
Amazing.

2610
01:56:24,120 --> 01:56:26,490
His sister is still in class.

2611
01:56:26,590 --> 01:56:28,030
Since I am wet

2612
01:56:28,030 --> 01:56:30,430
the towel is in the bag.

2613
01:56:29,390 --> 01:56:30,430
It's in your bag?

2614
01:56:30,430 --> 01:56:33,870
Just like his mother told him. Wipe yourself when you enter.

2615
01:56:33,870 --> 01:56:35,430
Great that you are on an errand.

2616
01:56:35,430 --> 01:56:36,630
It's a kid with common sense.

2617
01:56:37,470 --> 01:56:40,440
That's right. Put the slippers on too.

2618
01:56:42,010 --> 01:56:44,280
Let's go to the principal's office.

2619
01:56:43,240 --> 01:56:44,280
The principal's office?

2620
01:56:44,810 --> 01:56:48,410
Some might be terrified of such a prospect but

2621
01:56:48,410 --> 01:56:50,720
Yuuto has no idea what kind of room that is.

2622
01:56:50,720 --> 01:56:54,450
It's fine. He is being welcomed inside.

2623
01:56:54,450 --> 01:56:56,760
Sorry for intruding.

2624
01:56:56,320 --> 01:56:58,890
Makes you anxious.

2625
01:56:59,360 --> 01:57:01,190
It's the principal.

2626
01:57:01,190 --> 01:57:02,530
Good day.

2627
01:57:02,530 --> 01:57:03,660
Good day.

2628
01:57:03,930 --> 01:57:06,560
This school has faced these tiny visitors

2629
01:57:06,560 --> 01:57:10,340
and boasts of doing so for over 140 years.

2630
01:57:10,340 --> 01:57:13,270
And the two successive female principal's.

2631
01:57:13,270 --> 01:57:14,340
Sheet music.

2632
01:57:14,340 --> 01:57:16,140
You brought sheet music?

2633
01:57:16,740 --> 01:57:18,940
Can I look inside?

2634
01:57:19,440 --> 01:57:21,380
Tightly.

2635
01:57:20,550 --> 01:57:22,080
It has been taped up.

2636
01:57:22,080 --> 01:57:24,080
So that it doesn't get wet.

2637
01:57:24,820 --> 01:57:28,390
In order to avoid getting the important sheet music wet.

2638
01:57:28,390 --> 01:57:31,320
She wrapped it in 40 plastic bags.

2639
01:57:31,090 --> 01:57:33,320
That many!

2640
01:57:34,090 --> 01:57:35,930
It finally came out.

2641
01:57:35,760 --> 01:57:37,660
Amazing.

2642
01:57:38,960 --> 01:57:43,440
Sheet music for the choir class.

2643
01:57:43,440 --> 01:57:44,840
Thanks.

2644
01:57:44,840 --> 01:57:48,140
He has waited 20 minutes at the roomy principal's office.

2645
01:57:48,140 --> 01:57:49,940
Respecting the elders.

2646
01:57:49,940 --> 01:57:52,840
Persevering. Just like the Aizukko pledge.

2647
01:57:52,840 --> 01:57:54,840
How admirable.

2648
01:57:58,920 --> 01:58:00,090
It's his sister.

2649
01:58:00,090 --> 01:58:02,590
She was called to the principal's office.

2650
01:58:02,950 --> 01:58:05,460
Excuse me.

2651
01:58:05,460 --> 01:58:06,620
Yuuto.

2652
01:58:06,620 --> 01:58:08,890
He arrived 30 minutes ago.

2653
01:58:08,890 --> 01:58:11,160
Thank you.

2654
01:58:11,530 --> 01:58:14,070
I came here by myself right away.

2655
01:58:14,070 --> 01:58:16,130
How remarkable.

2656
01:58:15,470 --> 01:58:17,870
A kind sister.

2657
01:58:16,670 --> 01:58:17,940
You did your best.

2658
01:58:17,940 --> 01:58:19,600
What a moving response.

2659
01:58:19,600 --> 01:58:22,570
But that's not all.

2660
01:58:22,570 --> 01:58:25,480
Huh? Wait. Where's the script?

2661
01:58:25,480 --> 01:58:27,780
The script?

2662
01:58:26,310 --> 01:58:27,780
Something is missing.

2663
01:58:27,850 --> 01:58:31,180
There should be a script here. Not just this.

2664
01:58:31,950 --> 01:58:34,490
Mama probably forgot.

2665
01:58:36,390 --> 01:58:38,560
Mama, you shouldn't forget that.

2666
01:58:38,560 --> 01:58:42,430
Since it's a musical there is the sheet music but also a separate script.

2667
01:58:42,430 --> 01:58:45,130
Her mother didn't know.

2668
01:58:44,530 --> 01:58:45,800
Oh no.

2669
01:58:46,260 --> 01:58:48,830
Mama probably forgot.

2670
01:58:50,740 --> 01:58:53,240
Mama, you shouldn't forget that.

2671
01:58:53,240 --> 01:58:57,140
Since it's a musical there is the sheet music but also a separate script.

2672
01:58:57,140 --> 01:58:59,880
Her mother didn't know.

2673
01:58:59,040 --> 01:59:02,410
Script

2674
01:58:59,880 --> 01:59:02,410
It's at home above the piano.

2675
01:59:02,880 --> 01:59:05,450
The script. What will they do?

2676
01:59:08,120 --> 01:59:11,290
It's fine. I will borrow it from someone.

2677
01:59:11,290 --> 01:59:12,820
How good.

2678
01:59:12,820 --> 01:59:13,890
You still did your best.

2679
01:59:13,990 --> 01:59:15,160
Thank you.

2680
01:59:15,160 --> 01:59:16,860
A kind big sister.

2681
01:59:16,430 --> 01:59:18,260
She's so kind.

2682
01:59:17,660 --> 01:59:19,700
His sister understands.

2683
01:59:19,700 --> 01:59:22,970
The hardship of a 2 km route, 4 km round-way trip.

2684
01:59:22,970 --> 01:59:25,200
Despite me coming by myself.

2685
01:59:25,200 --> 01:59:27,770
And then it ended up like this.

2686
01:59:26,400 --> 01:59:30,070
- Like this.

2687
01:59:27,010 --> 01:59:30,070
- He's so serious.
- He still brought it.

2688
01:59:28,970 --> 01:59:33,140
It's fine. Your sister was truly happy.

2689
01:59:34,480 --> 01:59:37,120
This is gut-wrenching.

2690
01:59:35,750 --> 01:59:38,020
It was a failure.

2691
01:59:38,020 --> 01:59:39,850
He doesn't feel accomplished.

2692
01:59:39,850 --> 01:59:41,850
But you were told you didn't fail.

2693
01:59:42,320 --> 01:59:46,890
He opens the door with a gloomy feeling.

2694
01:59:47,530 --> 01:59:50,330
Yuuto, welcome back.

2695
01:59:51,100 --> 01:59:54,630
There was another thing she forgot.

2696
01:59:53,200 --> 01:59:54,630
Eh?

2697
01:59:54,800 --> 01:59:56,430
Did you give her the sheet music?

2698
01:59:56,430 --> 01:59:58,870
That's amazing.

2699
01:59:56,770 --> 01:59:58,870
But...

2700
01:59:58,870 --> 02:00:01,540
There was another thing she forgot.

2701
02:00:01,540 --> 02:00:02,870
Is that right?

2702
02:00:03,580 --> 02:00:07,850
What else did she forget besides the sheet music?

2703
02:00:08,710 --> 02:00:10,420
This is it. Found it.

2704
02:00:10,420 --> 02:00:11,850
The script.

2705
02:00:12,520 --> 02:00:13,950
I'm sorry Yuuto.

2706
02:00:13,950 --> 02:00:18,820
She messed up with the preparation prior to today.

2707
02:00:14,950 --> 02:00:18,820
This is it. I'm sorry.

2708
02:00:19,020 --> 02:00:21,730
It's the same cover. What will we do?

2709
02:00:21,730 --> 02:00:24,330
Though his sister told him it's fine she'll borrow it from someone.

2710
02:00:24,330 --> 02:00:27,000
He won't tell his mother that.

2711
02:00:29,430 --> 02:00:34,070
Yuuto. I'm sorry. I'm sorry. It's my mistake.

2712
02:00:34,240 --> 02:00:37,280
Though he did it properly he still feels gloomy.

2713
02:00:37,680 --> 02:00:40,750
Yuuto is not entering the house.

2714
02:00:41,350 --> 02:00:45,720
His mother has noticed Yuuto's wavering resolve.

2715
02:00:46,180 --> 02:00:47,950
Can you go again?

2716
02:00:48,790 --> 02:00:50,620
Will you go?

2717
02:00:50,760 --> 02:00:52,590
He will go.

2718
02:00:51,960 --> 02:00:54,630
It's 2 km.

2719
02:00:53,060 --> 02:00:54,630
Since it's you, Yuuto, you can do it.

2720
02:00:54,630 --> 02:00:56,090
I'm sorry.

2721
02:00:56,090 --> 02:00:57,700
Please do your best.

2722
02:00:59,400 --> 02:01:01,630
Must do what you must.

2723
02:01:03,030 --> 02:01:06,170
He finally understands the meaning of it.

2724
02:01:06,240 --> 02:01:08,610
Since it's you, Yuuto, you can do it.

2725
02:01:09,070 --> 02:01:11,780
You want to cry, right? You can cry.

2726
02:01:11,780 --> 02:01:15,780
His mother embraces him and lets him cry it out.

2727
02:01:15,780 --> 02:01:16,710
Sorry.

2728
02:01:17,120 --> 02:01:20,750
While crying he's still resolute and willing to go.

2729
02:01:22,750 --> 02:01:25,090
And when leaving the house...

2730
02:01:25,090 --> 02:01:27,090
He perfectly stops crying.

2731
02:01:34,870 --> 02:01:37,700
He departs with bravado.

2732
02:01:39,370 --> 02:01:42,510
The mother feels a sense of heavy duty.

2733
02:01:46,340 --> 02:01:49,350
She can't stand in the way of Yuuto's sense of accomplishment.

2734
02:01:49,350 --> 02:01:51,350
Must do what she must do.

2735
02:01:55,220 --> 02:01:59,620
The noon class starts at 1:30. That's less than 30 minutes left.

2736
02:02:01,560 --> 02:02:03,060
I better go.

2737
02:02:03,390 --> 02:02:06,630
The first time it took 40 minutes.

2738
02:02:06,630 --> 02:02:09,970
He won't make it if he isn't 10 minutes faster.

2739
02:02:09,970 --> 02:02:12,840
- Amazing.

2740
02:02:10,500 --> 02:02:12,840
- How does he have so much sense of responsibility?

2741
02:02:12,900 --> 02:02:18,280
Despite her feelings, his mother wants him to feel accomplished.

2742
02:02:18,280 --> 02:02:20,280
She must be stoic.

2743
02:02:23,310 --> 02:02:25,380
15 minutes left.

2744
02:02:24,620 --> 02:02:26,120
Do your best.

2745
02:02:26,320 --> 02:02:29,220
He's running rather than walking.
He's running rather than walking.

2746
02:02:29,220 --> 02:02:32,460
In the rain. He's made it half-way there.

2747
02:02:32,460 --> 02:02:36,530
This is like the face of an athlete.

2748
02:02:36,530 --> 02:02:39,200
It was rough and worrying.

2749
02:02:46,300 --> 02:02:48,110
Only 4 minutes left.

2750
02:02:48,940 --> 02:02:51,240
The rain has ceased.

2751
02:02:51,240 --> 02:02:53,240
Do your best.

2752
02:02:52,380 --> 02:02:54,950
He's almost within sight of the school.

2753
02:02:58,520 --> 02:03:02,550
She got a call by her mother that Yuuto is coming back.

2754
02:03:03,450 --> 02:03:05,560
He's coming back twice just for me?

2755
02:03:05,560 --> 02:03:07,660
His sister is in disbelief.

2756
02:03:09,190 --> 02:03:11,530
The school is right there.

2757
02:03:12,500 --> 02:03:13,900
What about the time?

2758
02:03:14,600 --> 02:03:17,300
Two minutes left. He can make it.

2759
02:03:20,100 --> 02:03:22,270
The crossing flags.

2760
02:03:22,740 --> 02:03:25,080
Even at such a time he doesn't just run.

2761
02:03:25,080 --> 02:03:27,550
Do what you must.

2762
02:03:28,010 --> 02:03:32,480
But...hurry. Hurry!

2763
02:03:33,550 --> 02:03:36,650
The bell will sound in one minute.

2764
02:03:37,590 --> 02:03:40,290
His sister is so full of anxious excitement.

2765
02:03:46,060 --> 02:03:48,170
Yuuto, you totally did your best.

2766
02:03:48,670 --> 02:03:50,400
I'm exhausted.

2767
02:03:52,870 --> 02:03:55,640
But I'm so happy.

2768
02:03:56,740 --> 02:03:58,340
It's the bell.

2769
02:03:58,680 --> 02:04:00,240
Do you understand?

2770
02:04:00,580 --> 02:04:03,010
But I'm so happy. Be happy.

2771
02:04:03,010 --> 02:04:04,850
Shaving 10 minutes off his last time.

2772
02:04:04,850 --> 02:04:06,280
He's at his limits.

2773
02:04:06,280 --> 02:04:08,490
He can't even celebrate.

2774
02:04:13,490 --> 02:04:17,160
His sister went back to the class right away.

2775
02:04:25,400 --> 02:04:28,910
Mother, he managed to deliver the script.

2776
02:04:29,840 --> 02:04:32,510
She's worried if it was alright to let him go twice.

2777
02:04:32,640 --> 02:04:35,380
She's anxious until she sees Yuuto's face.

2778
02:04:35,880 --> 02:04:37,180
Welcome back.

2779
02:04:37,180 --> 02:04:39,380
This face shows accomplishments.

2780
02:04:40,820 --> 02:04:42,950
Welcome back.

2781
02:04:42,950 --> 02:04:44,890
You did your best.

2782
02:04:44,890 --> 02:04:47,390
Thank you. Did you manage to go all the way?

2783
02:04:48,430 --> 02:04:51,700
It was cold, right? I see. You did well.

2784
02:04:52,300 --> 02:04:54,930
I'm sorry. Thank you.

2785
02:04:54,930 --> 02:04:57,070
Do what you must.

2786
02:04:55,000 --> 02:04:56,000
Amazing.

2787
02:04:57,070 --> 02:04:59,040
Don't do what you must not.

2788
02:04:59,270 --> 02:05:02,270
You should not do what you must not.

2789
02:05:02,270 --> 02:05:03,810
Amazing.

2790
02:05:02,870 --> 02:05:06,940
You can't see on his face that he ran 8 km.

2791
02:05:05,510 --> 02:05:07,950
Amazing.

2792
02:05:09,580 --> 02:05:11,350
Really amazing.

2793
02:05:11,550 --> 02:05:13,580
What an errand, right?

2794
02:05:13,580 --> 02:05:15,350
Yeah, it was amazing.

2795
02:05:15,350 --> 02:05:18,320
Ebizou, you cried a bit, right?

2796
02:05:18,320 --> 02:05:19,760
I totally didn't.

2797
02:05:19,760 --> 02:05:23,090
It was amazing as expected.

2798
02:05:23,090 --> 02:05:25,960
His mother didn't intend it to happen but

2799
02:05:25,960 --> 02:05:27,430
they forgot it at home

2800
02:05:27,430 --> 02:05:30,370
but it was an errand to erase regret

2801
02:05:30,370 --> 02:05:34,840
and those tears she shed.
I don't know how to express it.

2802
02:05:34,840 --> 02:05:38,980
He's to be praised after the first run alone.

2803
02:05:36,540 --> 02:05:38,980
That's right. That's how it should be.

2804
02:05:38,980 --> 02:05:42,210
But if it was real the mother would go, right?

2805
02:05:42,210 --> 02:05:47,390
But if she went then the boy's sense of accomplishment would be diminished.

2806
02:05:47,390 --> 02:05:51,220
The fact that his mother didn't go is truly love.

2807
02:05:50,290 --> 02:05:51,220
That's right.

2808
02:05:51,220 --> 02:05:52,720
It's amazing how

2809
02:05:52,720 --> 02:05:57,300
it showed the soul of Aizu. (In Fukushima prefecture)

2810
02:05:58,160 --> 02:06:02,300
Amami you kept saying that Aizu was amazing.

2811
02:06:02,530 --> 02:06:06,940
To see his face become determined

2812
02:06:06,940 --> 02:06:12,980
and how he carried the guilt that he had to go again but said he would "absolutely go".

2813
02:06:12,980 --> 02:06:17,050
Right. So many things to it. His mother was the one who forgot yet...

2814
02:06:17,050 --> 02:06:18,820
Yeah so many things in the mix.

2815
02:06:18,820 --> 02:06:21,820
Yeah, that was a little heart-wrenching.

2816
02:06:21,820 --> 02:06:23,850
As we speak about it you are about to...

2817
02:06:23,050 --> 02:06:23,850
Let's move on.

2818
02:06:23,850 --> 02:06:25,560
I'm fine.

2819
02:06:25,560 --> 02:06:26,790
You can pull it back.

2820
02:06:26,790 --> 02:06:28,660
Both his mothers'

2821
02:06:28,660 --> 02:06:30,900
but also his sisters' bond was splendid.

2822
02:06:31,460 --> 02:06:36,370
When she says "I'm happy" and "Be happy" that really made me think

2823
02:06:36,370 --> 02:06:38,340
that their bond

2824
02:06:38,340 --> 02:06:41,310
has grown even stronger.

2825
02:06:41,310 --> 02:06:44,610
And for the next errand is the adventures of a girl.

2826
02:06:44,610 --> 02:06:49,280
Where both the father and the daughter are stubborn and they wont compromise.

2827
02:06:50,080 --> 02:06:55,790
There's a father who never gets angry but he's so stubborn.

2828
02:06:57,120 --> 02:07:01,860
There's a father who never gets angry but he's so stubborn.

2829
02:07:01,860 --> 02:07:06,730
His daughters always do what their father tells them to do.

2830
02:07:07,370 --> 02:07:09,830
The father is a 3rd generation member of the farm.

2831
02:07:09,830 --> 02:07:13,940
They produce dried kaki for luxurious gifting.

2832
02:07:14,410 --> 02:07:16,670
When talking about Matsusato's dried kaki

2833
02:07:16,670 --> 02:07:20,710
it's the high grade product that represents Yamanashi and shipped all over the country.

2834
02:07:20,010 --> 02:07:22,480
Looks delicious.

2835
02:07:21,880 --> 02:07:24,420
In the distant mountains of Koushuu

2836
02:07:22,560 --> 02:07:27,040
Yamanashi ● Koushuu

2837
02:07:24,420 --> 02:07:29,390
Blessed with sun and well-drained soil they grow delicious kaki.

2838
02:07:29,390 --> 02:07:33,390
In the koufu basin a strong dry notherly wind blows.

2839
02:07:33,390 --> 02:07:36,030
It's the optimal climate for making dried kaki.

2840
02:07:36,930 --> 02:07:39,030
It goes back in history.

2841
02:07:39,030 --> 02:07:43,900
In old woodblock prints the method of making dried kaki is depicted as well.

2842
02:07:42,700 --> 02:07:44,700
Amazing.

2843
02:07:45,140 --> 02:07:50,710
The time around late November is the most spectacular season of the year.

2844
02:07:49,210 --> 02:07:51,210
How picturesque.

2845
02:07:50,710 --> 02:07:53,410
The drying kaki color the whole town.

2846
02:07:53,410 --> 02:07:57,780
It invites a loving motif for photographers in the prefecture.

2847
02:07:58,720 --> 02:08:04,520
Big sister

2848
02:07:58,720 --> 02:08:04,520
Ririka

2849
02:07:59,150 --> 02:08:02,850
The little sister Ririka will go on her first errand.

2850
02:08:02,850 --> 02:08:05,360
She always copies her big sister.

2851
02:08:05,360 --> 02:08:08,630
Every year, at her big sisters elementary school, during this time

2852
02:08:08,630 --> 02:08:10,530
they peel the kaki

2853
02:08:10,530 --> 02:08:13,200
and learn how to prepare them.

2854
02:08:13,200 --> 02:08:15,530
Even households that don't make their own

2855
02:08:15,530 --> 02:08:18,640
the children all get to learn how to help out.

2856
02:08:18,640 --> 02:08:21,170
That's how the children are raised here.

2857
02:08:21,810 --> 02:08:25,280
Through ages the families have gathered at home like this

2858
02:08:25,280 --> 02:08:29,850
And they peel the kaki all day for an entire week.

2859
02:08:25,940 --> 02:08:27,750
Son of
great-granduncle

2860
02:08:26,140 --> 02:08:27,750
Granduncle

2861
02:08:28,050 --> 02:08:29,850
Daughter of
great-granduncle

2862
02:08:28,210 --> 02:08:29,850
Granduncle

2863
02:08:30,150 --> 02:08:32,380
If my sister helps out so will I!

2864
02:08:32,380 --> 02:08:35,090
Is she preventing her father from working?

2865
02:08:35,290 --> 02:08:37,860
Okay.

2866
02:08:35,890 --> 02:08:37,860
How many is this?

2867
02:08:37,860 --> 02:08:39,160
Let me see...

2868
02:08:39,560 --> 02:08:40,660
Fifth one.

2869
02:08:40,660 --> 02:08:44,130
No no, she's seriously helping out.

2870
02:08:44,130 --> 02:08:46,400
Time to change our gloves.

2871
02:08:46,400 --> 02:08:50,530
That's right or they will tear again. So please do it.

2872
02:08:50,670 --> 02:08:52,530
Just like a tissue box

2873
02:08:52,530 --> 02:08:55,240
there are 100 single-use gloves.

2874
02:08:55,240 --> 02:08:57,580
Thank you. I will take this one.

2875
02:08:57,580 --> 02:08:59,410
No more left.

2876
02:08:58,440 --> 02:08:59,410
Any left for me?

2877
02:08:59,410 --> 02:09:00,680
It's already empty.

2878
02:09:00,680 --> 02:09:02,380
There's none for your Papa, huh?

2879
02:09:03,550 --> 02:09:05,150
This must be the errand.

2880
02:09:06,280 --> 02:09:08,720
Can you go buy some?

2881
02:09:06,950 --> 02:09:08,720
The size is L(arge).

2882
02:09:08,720 --> 02:09:10,790
Do you understand L? What's it look like?

2883
02:09:11,790 --> 02:09:14,090
That's right. Single-use gloves.

2884
02:09:14,930 --> 02:09:19,230
Take this good-luck charm.

2885
02:09:15,490 --> 02:09:19,230
There a microphone in the charm her mother made.

2886
02:09:19,230 --> 02:09:21,430
You can do. Yes you can. So do your best.

2887
02:09:21,430 --> 02:09:22,670
Her mothers' wish.

2888
02:09:22,670 --> 02:09:24,840
You can do. Yes you can. So do your best.

2889
02:09:24,070 --> 02:09:24,840
So you can go?

2890
02:09:25,570 --> 02:09:28,870
Her mother who is a pâtissier is at work today.

2891
02:09:28,010 --> 02:09:30,210
I see.

2892
02:09:29,270 --> 02:09:33,540
At the hardware store she needs L-sized gloves and string to hang the kaki with.

2893
02:09:33,540 --> 02:09:36,010
At the drug store she needs to get snacks for 3 O'clock tea

2894
02:09:36,010 --> 02:09:39,880
and bandages for her father to wrap around his fingers.

2895
02:09:40,180 --> 02:09:41,920
I can do my best.

2896
02:09:41,920 --> 02:09:43,020
She's quickly off.

2897
02:09:43,020 --> 02:09:46,390
She's off in a light and good mood.

2898
02:09:50,260 --> 02:09:53,200
I can do it. I can do it.
Yes, I can. Yes, I can.

2899
02:09:53,200 --> 02:09:55,030
As long as it's for her father.

2900
02:09:55,030 --> 02:09:55,970
I can do my best.

2901
02:09:55,970 --> 02:09:59,670
Mom, she can definitely do it and do her best at it.

2902
02:09:59,670 --> 02:10:02,270
Ririka loves her dad so much.

2903
02:10:02,270 --> 02:10:06,680
Her father who is responsible for the farm after her grandfather suddenly fell ill.

2904
02:10:06,680 --> 02:10:09,380
Actually there's a different part to him.

2905
02:10:11,820 --> 02:10:14,820
He can be seen on the stage

2906
02:10:15,520 --> 02:10:19,690
with various famous artists all over the country.

2907
02:10:19,690 --> 02:10:22,390
He's a pro guitarist.

2908
02:10:23,860 --> 02:10:26,560
He made a band in junior high school.

2909
02:10:26,560 --> 02:10:30,700
He went to university in Tokyo and became a pro musician.

2910
02:10:30,700 --> 02:10:33,440
You can do. Yes you can. So do your best.

2911
02:10:33,440 --> 02:10:38,580
His fate has conflicted between what he wants to do and what he must do.

2912
02:10:43,410 --> 02:10:48,550
Ririka is always following her sister around and loves being babied.

2913
02:10:48,550 --> 02:10:51,890
I can do. Yes I can.

2914
02:10:54,930 --> 02:10:56,230
This song

2915
02:10:56,230 --> 02:10:59,100
Ririka's father made a song with her in mind.

2916
02:10:59,100 --> 02:11:02,400
Title is: The road of kaki leaves.

2917
02:11:02,030 --> 02:11:04,400
How wonderful.

2918
02:11:12,680 --> 02:11:15,610
The hardware store is within sight.

2919
02:11:19,520 --> 02:11:24,960
All the farms It's the height of dried kaki making time so it's more crowded than usual.

2920
02:11:25,990 --> 02:11:29,890
The cashier is a friend of her mothers from her preschool.

2921
02:11:29,890 --> 02:11:30,960
Did you come by yourself?

2922
02:11:31,360 --> 02:11:32,530
What will you purchase?

2923
02:11:32,530 --> 02:11:34,330
Gloves.

2924
02:11:33,330 --> 02:11:35,500
There are so many types of gloves here.

2925
02:11:35,500 --> 02:11:37,940
Did they tell you what the gloves will be used for?

2926
02:11:37,940 --> 02:11:39,570
Kaki.

2927
02:11:39,640 --> 02:11:42,070
Do you know the size of the gloves?

2928
02:11:42,670 --> 02:11:44,710
If it's L then is it fine with white ones?

2929
02:11:44,710 --> 02:11:46,610
White gloves.

2930
02:11:46,780 --> 02:11:48,510
We have these and these.

2931
02:11:48,510 --> 02:11:50,210
This one?

2932
02:11:50,980 --> 02:11:53,780
She picked the correct ones. The box with 100 L gloves.

2933
02:11:56,490 --> 02:11:58,490
You got it? Did you find the right one?

2934
02:11:59,490 --> 02:12:01,090
Will papa use them?

2935
02:12:01,190 --> 02:12:03,830
He's peeling kaki.

2936
02:12:02,330 --> 02:12:03,830
You are all preparing kaki?

2937
02:12:03,830 --> 02:12:05,900
And you ran out of gloves?

2938
02:12:06,160 --> 02:12:08,500
They tore.

2939
02:12:06,960 --> 02:12:08,500
They tore?

2940
02:12:09,470 --> 02:12:11,440
Were you asked to get something else?

2941
02:12:11,440 --> 02:12:15,770
And string to hang kaki.

2942
02:12:13,400 --> 02:12:15,770
And string to hang kaki?

2943
02:12:16,210 --> 02:12:20,680
In this area they have a special corner for drying kaki.

2944
02:12:21,280 --> 02:12:24,750
The tools change depending on the type of agriculture.

2945
02:12:24,750 --> 02:12:28,050
So just saying "string" leaves you with many options.

2946
02:12:26,250 --> 02:12:28,590
That's amazing.

2947
02:12:28,220 --> 02:12:30,450
Which one will do?

2948
02:12:30,450 --> 02:12:35,090
The thin or the thick ones. Which do you need? Thin?

2949
02:12:35,360 --> 02:12:36,560
White.

2950
02:12:36,560 --> 02:12:38,060
I see.

2951
02:12:38,060 --> 02:12:41,330
The one that her family uses is white.

2952
02:12:41,330 --> 02:12:43,200
For the white strings...

2953
02:12:43,570 --> 02:12:45,570
It says: Kaki strings.

2954
02:12:45,570 --> 02:12:48,340
These are specially made for kaki.

2955
02:12:48,770 --> 02:12:52,640
You can grip the kaki in between like this.

2956
02:12:51,510 --> 02:12:52,640
That's how we do.

2957
02:12:52,640 --> 02:12:54,880
That's how you do it? Then let's go with this one.

2958
02:12:55,150 --> 02:12:58,580
She's been observant when her father works.

2959
02:12:58,580 --> 02:13:00,920
It's exactly this type of white string.

2960
02:13:01,090 --> 02:13:03,720
What's this?

2961
02:13:03,720 --> 02:13:04,990
You can do. You can do.

2962
02:13:04,990 --> 02:13:06,920
You can do? You can do?

2963
02:13:06,920 --> 02:13:08,460
That's amazing.

2964
02:13:07,420 --> 02:13:08,460
You can do your best.

2965
02:13:08,460 --> 02:13:10,130
I see. You can do your best.

2966
02:13:10,130 --> 02:13:12,260
If you try you can accomplish it, Riri.

2967
02:13:12,360 --> 02:13:14,700
Do your best. High-five.

2968
02:13:14,700 --> 02:13:15,930
Off you go.

2969
02:13:15,930 --> 02:13:19,100
She did it. Yes, she did. She did her best.

2970
02:13:19,600 --> 02:13:22,140
And for the 3 O'clock tea time...

2971
02:13:22,140 --> 02:13:25,640
And also the bandages to protect her fathers fingers.

2972
02:13:25,640 --> 02:13:29,150
She has arrived at the drug store.

2973
02:13:29,510 --> 02:13:31,950
Here there's also a specialty corner.

2974
02:13:31,950 --> 02:13:34,450
Since everyone is preparing kaki these days.

2975
02:13:34,450 --> 02:13:37,350
A line-up with great additions for their tea break.

2976
02:13:37,350 --> 02:13:42,660
She was asked to get anko dango but they are sold out.

2977
02:13:44,160 --> 02:13:47,970
But there's anko in these too so they will do.

2978
02:13:47,970 --> 02:13:50,400
It's hard to make such a decision.

2979
02:13:55,770 --> 02:13:59,510
While considering it she gets the bandages first.

2980
02:13:58,540 --> 02:14:00,540
Remarkable.

2981
02:13:59,510 --> 02:14:01,910
For a guitarist their fingers are their life.

2982
02:14:01,910 --> 02:14:04,110
So he wraps them in bandage.

2983
02:14:04,110 --> 02:14:07,280
She found the bandages right away.

2984
02:14:07,450 --> 02:14:11,320
But she's lost in the many types.

2985
02:14:11,320 --> 02:14:14,190
Which one should I get?

2986
02:14:14,190 --> 02:14:16,730
She can't decide for herself.

2987
02:14:18,400 --> 02:14:22,200
She doesn't know any of the store workers and without asking any

2988
02:14:22,200 --> 02:14:25,940
she leaves the shop without purchasing anything.

2989
02:14:24,700 --> 02:14:26,700
How come?

2990
02:14:26,700 --> 02:14:28,940
She's not confident.

2991
02:14:28,940 --> 02:14:34,010
She has become a Ririka who: Can't do it. Can't do her best.

2992
02:14:52,360 --> 02:14:55,870
Despite completing the errand at the hardware store.

2993
02:14:56,330 --> 02:14:58,840
She carries a sense of defeat.

2994
02:14:58,840 --> 02:15:03,040
And it can be seen on her face as she returns.

2995
02:15:05,110 --> 02:15:08,550
Welcome back. That was quick.

2996
02:15:08,550 --> 02:15:09,750
Welcome back.

2997
02:15:09,750 --> 02:15:10,780
Amazing.

2998
02:15:10,780 --> 02:15:13,520
You bought gloves?

2999
02:15:13,520 --> 02:15:17,960
That's so great.

3000
02:15:14,990 --> 02:15:17,960
Even though she's being praised her face says it all.

3001
02:15:17,290 --> 02:15:19,290
That's expected.

3002
02:15:17,960 --> 02:15:23,430
You went and got some? How great.

3003
02:15:23,430 --> 02:15:26,760
Thank you.

3004
02:15:27,300 --> 02:15:29,330
Huh? Huh?

3005
02:15:29,330 --> 02:15:30,570
What about the dango?

3006
02:15:30,570 --> 02:15:32,270
There it is.

3007
02:15:32,270 --> 02:15:33,570
Did you go to Nakaya?

3008
02:15:33,570 --> 02:15:35,370
She did go but you see...

3009
02:15:35,370 --> 02:15:36,510
They didn't have dango?

3010
02:15:36,510 --> 02:15:38,410
They didn't have dango.

3011
02:15:38,410 --> 02:15:40,540
They only had the soybean ones.

3012
02:15:39,410 --> 02:15:40,540
They only had the soybean ones?

3013
02:15:40,540 --> 02:15:44,120
Then the green ones would've been fine.

3014
02:15:41,810 --> 02:15:45,580
See...you could've gotten the green ones.

3015
02:15:45,820 --> 02:15:48,190
Can you go again?

3016
02:15:47,720 --> 02:15:50,090
She looks so surprised.

3017
02:15:48,990 --> 02:15:50,190
I want to go with papa.

3018
02:15:50,190 --> 02:15:52,420
I'm busy.

3019
02:15:52,420 --> 02:15:53,560
When this is over...

3020
02:15:53,560 --> 02:15:55,230
Ririka can't go.

3021
02:15:55,230 --> 02:15:57,530
She said it clearly.

3022
02:15:58,400 --> 02:15:59,830
I'm tired.

3023
02:15:59,260 --> 02:15:59,830
You're tired?

3024
02:15:59,830 --> 02:16:02,100
But she's not exhausted yet.

3025
02:16:03,500 --> 02:16:05,100
I'm tired.

3026
02:16:05,100 --> 02:16:06,670
He's a father who

3027
02:16:06,670 --> 02:16:09,610
never scolds his kids or yells at them.

3028
02:16:09,610 --> 02:16:12,780
If they don't have manjyuu what else were you supposed to get?

3029
02:16:14,340 --> 02:16:15,680
I'm tired.

3030
02:16:15,680 --> 02:16:16,880
She has decided not to go.

3031
02:16:17,050 --> 02:16:19,720
He knows what she's trying to do.

3032
02:16:23,190 --> 02:16:23,990
Achoo.

3033
02:16:23,990 --> 02:16:25,090
What a nice sound

3034
02:16:25,060 --> 02:16:26,360
Nice old man.

3035
02:16:28,890 --> 02:16:33,260
We appreciate the gloves but we would also really like to eat some manjyuu.

3036
02:16:33,900 --> 02:16:37,000
Riri, thank you for the gloves.

3037
02:16:37,000 --> 02:16:38,740
But with the tea

3038
02:16:38,740 --> 02:16:42,740
I would like to eat some manjyuu. Please, Riri.

3039
02:16:45,110 --> 02:16:46,480
And with that...

3040
02:16:46,980 --> 02:16:49,550
Ririka, let's go outside.

3041
02:16:48,350 --> 02:16:49,550
Yeah, please go.

3042
02:16:49,550 --> 02:16:51,320
Let's take a break.

3043
02:16:51,320 --> 02:16:53,420
Trying to change her mood.

3044
02:16:53,780 --> 02:16:56,390
We are both pretty tired.

3045
02:16:57,150 --> 02:17:01,530
Since I play guitar my fingers are crucial.

3046
02:17:01,730 --> 02:17:05,800
You can just use a pick instead.

3047
02:17:03,960 --> 02:17:05,800
I see.

3048
02:17:05,800 --> 02:17:08,330
Then it won't be a problem.

3049
02:17:06,860 --> 02:17:08,330
What about this hand?

3050
02:17:08,330 --> 02:17:11,970
If the fingers on this hand are hurt then it will ruin the sound.

3051
02:17:11,970 --> 02:17:13,670
She lost the argument.

3052
02:17:14,870 --> 02:17:17,140
That's why they are needed.

3053
02:17:17,310 --> 02:17:18,840
What will you do if I trip and fall?

3054
02:17:18,840 --> 02:17:20,210
Then I will apply a bandage.

3055
02:17:21,780 --> 02:17:24,210
Ririka won't fall over.

3056
02:17:25,020 --> 02:17:27,880
I didn't know which type of bandage to get.

3057
02:17:27,880 --> 02:17:31,920
Ask a store worker loudly?

3058
02:17:30,150 --> 02:17:31,920
Eh?

3059
02:17:34,560 --> 02:17:39,300
I can't use a loud voice.

3060
02:17:35,930 --> 02:17:39,300
Then use a quiet voice.

3061
02:17:38,100 --> 02:17:39,830
Trying his best to reason with her.

3062
02:17:39,300 --> 02:17:41,900
Since it's you, Ririka, you can do it.

3063
02:17:39,900 --> 02:17:41,900
I feel like eating dango all of a sudden.

3064
02:17:41,900 --> 02:17:44,000
Then please go and buy some dango.

3065
02:17:44,000 --> 02:17:47,240
When mama is done I can go with her.

3066
02:17:47,240 --> 02:17:51,440
Then it will be late and everyone here will go home.

3067
02:17:49,910 --> 02:17:52,140
Seems hard.

3068
02:17:51,540 --> 02:17:56,780
Their conversation outside has been going on for 30 minutes.

3069
02:17:56,980 --> 02:18:02,820
Your extended family members are all doing their best with the Kaki. What about you, Ririka?

3070
02:18:04,090 --> 02:18:05,990
Ririka...

3071
02:18:06,760 --> 02:18:11,760
Her fathers insistence isn't wavering. He's stubborn.

3072
02:18:14,430 --> 02:18:16,230
What's that?

3073
02:18:17,230 --> 02:18:19,600
It's the drone filming them.

3074
02:18:19,600 --> 02:18:21,770
It's going away.

3075
02:18:20,840 --> 02:18:23,040
Oh no, I've been found out.

3076
02:18:23,040 --> 02:18:25,610
It's escaping.

3077
02:18:24,170 --> 02:18:26,240
Escaping.

3078
02:18:28,150 --> 02:18:29,880
Yeah, that's concerning.

3079
02:18:29,980 --> 02:18:32,450
Sorry for intruding.

3080
02:18:32,950 --> 02:18:34,990
Ririka, can you read this?

3081
02:18:34,990 --> 02:18:40,320
You can do it. Yes, you can. You can do your best.

3082
02:18:40,320 --> 02:18:42,530
Let's go!

3083
02:18:41,260 --> 02:18:42,490
Finally.

3084
02:18:41,600 --> 02:18:43,380
Remarkable.

3085
02:18:42,530 --> 02:18:44,260
Yes, you can do it.

3086
02:18:44,260 --> 02:18:45,200
Can you go?

3087
02:18:45,200 --> 02:18:46,530
And what if it rains?

3088
02:18:46,530 --> 02:18:48,130
Doesn't look like it will.

3089
02:18:48,130 --> 02:18:50,130
She's still making excuses.

3090
02:18:51,900 --> 02:18:54,370
Off I go.

3091
02:18:52,670 --> 02:18:54,370
Off you go.

3092
02:18:54,370 --> 02:18:56,370
Just like her father insisted.

3093
02:18:56,370 --> 02:18:59,510
She's on her second errand.

3094
02:18:59,510 --> 02:19:02,180
She's getting snacks for the 3 O'clock tea.

3095
02:19:02,180 --> 02:19:06,050
And bandages to protect her guitar playing father.

3096
02:19:13,620 --> 02:19:15,860
She's playing an instrument.

3097
02:19:19,300 --> 02:19:22,300
I was about to think that she wouldn't go.

3098
02:19:22,300 --> 02:19:25,440
You did well in revving her engine.

3099
02:19:25,440 --> 02:19:28,710
And her fathers new original song: "The road of kaki leaves".

3100
02:19:28,710 --> 02:19:32,940
It's a song born from the image of Ririka walking on her errand.

3101
02:20:04,740 --> 02:20:07,880
I can do it. I can do my best.

3102
02:20:07,110 --> 02:20:08,550
Do your best.

3103
02:20:07,910 --> 02:20:11,680
Can she ask the store worker this time?

3104
02:20:11,350 --> 02:20:12,820
Please do your best.

3105
02:20:12,950 --> 02:20:14,820
Where do you have dango?

3106
02:20:14,820 --> 02:20:16,320
She asked without hesitation.

3107
02:20:16,520 --> 02:20:19,120
Did you come to buy dango? Come with me.

3108
02:20:19,990 --> 02:20:23,430
I'm sorry but we've run out today. What to do? Will this do?

3109
02:20:23,430 --> 02:20:25,400
That's right. This one will do.

3110
02:20:25,400 --> 02:20:27,160
How many?

3111
02:20:27,160 --> 02:20:28,570
Six.

3112
02:20:27,800 --> 02:20:28,570
Six?

3113
02:20:28,930 --> 02:20:30,330
We are preparing kaki.

3114
02:20:30,330 --> 02:20:32,540
You are preparing Kaki at home today?

3115
02:20:32,740 --> 02:20:34,700
I see, I see. Then you need 6 indeed.

3116
02:20:34,700 --> 02:20:37,340
Even with a quiet voice she was able to convey it.

3117
02:20:38,010 --> 02:20:41,580
Since so many of her extended family have come.

3118
02:20:41,810 --> 02:20:44,580
Will you be fine if you get 4 of those and 2 of these?

3119
02:20:44,710 --> 02:20:46,020
Are you be fine with that?

3120
02:20:46,020 --> 02:20:48,950
She goes for it at her own discretion.

3121
02:20:48,950 --> 02:20:51,690
The store worker is hurrying towards the checkout.

3122
02:20:51,690 --> 02:20:53,490
She better mention the other thing.

3123
02:20:53,490 --> 02:20:55,490
And bandages.

3124
02:20:54,560 --> 02:20:55,490
Bandages?

3125
02:20:55,490 --> 02:20:57,260
She was able to say it.

3126
02:20:58,700 --> 02:21:00,700
This is a bulk pack. Is that fine?

3127
02:21:00,900 --> 02:21:04,730
Will you get this then? It has 100.

3128
02:21:04,730 --> 02:21:06,100
100 bandages?

3129
02:21:06,100 --> 02:21:09,710
I don't have the money for 100.

3130
02:21:07,800 --> 02:21:09,710
You don't have the money?

3131
02:21:09,870 --> 02:21:12,180
How many do you need?

3132
02:21:12,180 --> 02:21:13,110
Just one?

3133
02:21:13,610 --> 02:21:15,750
We don't sell just one.

3134
02:21:15,750 --> 02:21:22,050
You see... While it has 100 bandages in the pack it only costs 149 Yen.

3135
02:21:21,050 --> 02:21:23,220
That's cheap.

3136
02:21:22,390 --> 02:21:24,020
It's this cheap?

3137
02:21:24,020 --> 02:21:25,860
Will you get it then?

3138
02:21:25,860 --> 02:21:28,330
That's 628 Yen.

3139
02:21:28,330 --> 02:21:31,430
The bandages are for papa, right?

3140
02:21:31,760 --> 02:21:34,600
He plays guitar.

3141
02:21:34,600 --> 02:21:36,200
He plays guitar?

3142
02:21:35,500 --> 02:21:38,600
She's regaining her confidence.

3143
02:21:36,200 --> 02:21:40,200
Is it because he plays guitar that he needs to protect his fingers?

3144
02:21:40,200 --> 02:21:43,440
So he will use them to protect his fingers?

3145
02:21:44,670 --> 02:21:45,840
You are a bright child.

3146
02:21:45,840 --> 02:21:49,380
Please take this to papa, your mama and family members.

3147
02:21:49,380 --> 02:21:51,720
Thank you very much.

3148
02:21:51,720 --> 02:21:54,620
Even from behind she's beaming with confidence.

3149
02:21:54,620 --> 02:21:56,950
A huge difference from last time she came.

3150
02:22:03,590 --> 02:22:07,660
She was able to. She did it. She did her best.

3151
02:22:24,510 --> 02:22:27,080
A satisfied face.

3152
02:22:40,460 --> 02:22:45,240
She's walking back on the same road as before but there's a big difference.

3153
02:22:46,270 --> 02:22:49,670
Ririka loves the kaki season.

3154
02:22:49,670 --> 02:22:54,840
Because that's the season her father is home instead of away on the usual live tours.

3155
02:22:55,250 --> 02:22:57,750
Her father is waiting.

3156
02:22:57,750 --> 02:23:01,120
He's wondering about her face when she opens the door.

3157
02:23:06,020 --> 02:23:08,190
Welcome back.

3158
02:23:06,520 --> 02:23:08,190
This face.

3159
02:23:08,430 --> 02:23:11,860
Welcome back.
Thank you.

3160
02:23:12,530 --> 02:23:13,860
Amazingly quick.

3161
02:23:13,860 --> 02:23:16,370
She made it for the 3 O'clock break.

3162
02:23:16,370 --> 02:23:18,870
You got lots of green manjyuu.

3163
02:23:19,100 --> 02:23:20,670
They only had four.

3164
02:23:20,670 --> 02:23:23,270
I see. But you were able to ask the store worker.

3165
02:23:23,270 --> 02:23:25,510
But it was with a quiet voice, though.

3166
02:23:25,980 --> 02:23:27,880
How amazing.

3167
02:23:27,880 --> 02:23:31,750
Thank you. Let's have some tea.

3168
02:23:32,620 --> 02:23:34,850
Enjoy these manjyuu.

3169
02:23:35,320 --> 02:23:38,760
Everyone, thank you for your hard work.

3170
02:23:37,350 --> 02:23:38,760
Thanks for the treat.

3171
02:23:39,020 --> 02:23:43,230
Thank you. You purchased these?

3172
02:23:43,360 --> 02:23:45,030
Delicious.

3173
02:23:45,030 --> 02:23:47,200
How great.

3174
02:23:47,900 --> 02:23:50,770
This is also a break to appreciate the work of Ririka.

3175
02:23:50,100 --> 02:23:52,870
That's true.

3176
02:23:50,670 --> 02:23:52,870
Is it delicious?

3177
02:23:52,870 --> 02:23:54,600
Welcome back.

3178
02:23:54,600 --> 02:23:58,270
Her pâtissier mother has returned from her job.

3179
02:23:58,270 --> 02:23:59,980
What did you do?

3180
02:23:59,980 --> 02:24:01,180
I went shopping.

3181
02:24:01,180 --> 02:24:02,610
Only once?

3182
02:24:02,610 --> 02:24:04,110
You went twice? Why?

3183
02:24:04,110 --> 02:24:07,180
There's so much she wants to tell her mother.

3184
02:24:07,180 --> 02:24:09,250
Let's go.

3185
02:24:08,320 --> 02:24:09,250
You see.

3186
02:24:09,390 --> 02:24:12,020
Daddy is so stubborn.
