1
00:00:00,750 --> 00:00:04,050
1st Time on Gaki no Tsukai ya Arrahende...

2
00:00:02,110 --> 00:00:04,050
So loud!

3
00:00:04,050 --> 00:00:04,920
He is.

4
00:00:04,920 --> 00:00:06,720
He's just so loud.

5
00:00:06,720 --> 00:00:08,720
Definitely in good form.

6
00:00:07,420 --> 00:00:11,160
It's so loud, I have no idea what he's saying.

7
00:00:11,160 --> 00:00:14,330
You know they say, 'The louder the person, the more insecure.'

8
00:00:14,330 --> 00:00:20,270
1st Time on Gaki no Tsukai ya Arrahende
"I'm the One Who Understands you Best!"

9
00:00:20,270 --> 00:00:23,800
"Anyways, I Think You'll Like this Item!!"

10
00:00:27,240 --> 00:00:34,510
A special series on Gaki, where the members buy gifts for guests based on their interests!!

11
00:00:34,710 --> 00:00:37,720
What did you guys think about it this time? You find it hard?

12
00:00:37,720 --> 00:00:40,490
It was super tough this time.

13
00:00:39,520 --> 00:00:41,220
It was right?

14
00:00:42,290 --> 00:00:44,220
Yama-chan, you've gotta try harder.

15
00:00:42,950 --> 00:00:53,400
Endō

16
00:00:42,950 --> 00:00:53,400
Hamada

17
00:00:42,950 --> 00:00:53,400
Hōsei

18
00:00:42,950 --> 00:00:53,400
Matsumoto

19
00:00:42,950 --> 00:00:53,400
Tanaka

20
00:00:44,220 --> 00:00:46,220
You've had the worst item 8 times already.

21
00:00:46,630 --> 00:00:48,030
Really?!

22
00:00:48,230 --> 00:00:53,400
But isn't this the segment where we expose Tanaka's lack of style?

23
00:00:54,160 --> 00:00:57,200
So, who is today's guest!?

24
00:00:57,270 --> 00:01:00,110
So, let's welcome out today's guest!

25
00:01:07,550 --> 00:01:12,180
Nakamura Tamao

26
00:01:11,920 --> 00:01:13,750
Good Evening.

27
00:01:14,850 --> 00:01:18,990
So today you've come dressed casually just for us.

28
00:01:22,290 --> 00:01:26,130
'There's no way she's gonna show up in full body tights, right?'

29
00:01:27,000 --> 00:01:29,470
Actress Nakamura Tamao

30
00:01:29,470 --> 00:01:33,170
She has a strong image of wearing traditional Japanese clothing.

31
00:01:33,170 --> 00:01:40,310
The Gaki members will be presenting her with a top and an accessory they think she will like!!

32
00:01:40,310 --> 00:01:43,010
We usually have this image of you in a kimono...

33
00:01:43,010 --> 00:01:45,350
This is probably the first time we've met like this?

34
00:01:45,350 --> 00:01:47,290
This is probably the first time we've met like this?

35
00:01:47,290 --> 00:01:48,390
What a shock!

36
00:01:48,390 --> 00:01:51,590
You've met Downtown on so many occasions.

37
00:01:51,590 --> 00:01:54,860
You've just completely s@#t on all of that!

38
00:01:55,030 --> 00:01:56,930
You mean in casual stuff, right?

39
00:01:57,830 --> 00:01:59,500
I can't think of a time where you haven't been in a kimono.

40
00:01:59,500 --> 00:02:01,400
I can't think of a time where you haven't been in a kimono.

41
00:02:00,830 --> 00:02:03,100
This is how I usually dress.

42
00:02:03,870 --> 00:02:07,410
If that's the case, this might be a little difficult.

43
00:02:08,820 --> 00:02:09,940
Is that so?

44
00:02:09,940 --> 00:02:14,650
We just had a nice chat in the green room.

45
00:02:14,780 --> 00:02:16,280
Thank you very much.

46
00:02:17,380 --> 00:02:20,720
Have you ever met him much?

47
00:02:19,550 --> 00:02:20,720
With me.

48
00:02:20,720 --> 00:02:21,550
No... not really...

49
00:02:21,550 --> 00:02:23,720
No... not really...

50
00:02:24,020 --> 00:02:25,720
For work.

51
00:02:26,160 --> 00:02:30,030
We've only met briefly on occasion.

52
00:02:30,030 --> 00:02:30,860
I've met you quite a few times though.

53
00:02:30,860 --> 00:02:32,360
I've met you quite a few times though.

54
00:02:32,440 --> 00:02:36,700
Since I see you on TV, I'm not sure whether we've met or not.

55
00:02:37,160 --> 00:02:38,800
Tamao-san, sorry...

56
00:02:38,800 --> 00:02:40,570
Several times...

57
00:02:39,800 --> 00:02:40,570
We've met.

58
00:02:43,180 --> 00:02:43,710
Sorry

59
00:02:43,710 --> 00:02:47,210
Do you even know my name?

60
00:02:44,780 --> 00:02:45,980
I don't know

61
00:02:45,980 --> 00:02:47,780
I'm sorry

62
00:02:48,210 --> 00:02:50,180
I can't hear you!

63
00:02:51,380 --> 00:02:54,150
You know these two of course, right?

64
00:02:53,150 --> 00:02:54,150
Yes

65
00:02:54,150 --> 00:02:57,960
More or less.

66
00:02:55,050 --> 00:02:57,960
More or less?!

67
00:02:58,130 --> 00:03:00,130
There's no way you'd know us then.

68
00:03:00,860 --> 00:03:01,860
Hamada-san and Matsumoto-san.

69
00:03:01,860 --> 00:03:04,830
Hamada-san and Matsumoto-san.

70
00:03:02,390 --> 00:03:04,830
Wrong way round!!

71
00:03:02,790 --> 00:03:04,830
Wrong way round!!

72
00:03:07,100 --> 00:03:11,270
Before the show, the five members went shopping.

73
00:03:11,600 --> 00:03:17,280
Musashi-Koyama Shopping Street "Palm"

74
00:03:12,440 --> 00:03:17,280
Hōsei, looking for something different, heads to Musashi-Koyama Shopping Street "Palm".

75
00:03:17,520 --> 00:03:18,680
This is perfect.

76
00:03:19,380 --> 00:03:21,250
This place's image is perfect.

77
00:03:22,080 --> 00:03:24,080
But...

78
00:03:24,080 --> 00:03:25,650
I'm not looking for this kind of pattern.

79
00:03:25,650 --> 00:03:29,050
I'm not looking for this kind of pattern.

80
00:03:29,190 --> 00:03:32,160
Something white or black.

81
00:03:32,160 --> 00:03:33,430
But, these are the kind of image I'm thinking of.

82
00:03:33,430 --> 00:03:35,190
But, these are the kind of image I'm thinking of.

83
00:03:35,290 --> 00:03:37,500
Something nice and bright

84
00:03:37,830 --> 00:03:39,260
for around the neck.

85
00:03:39,600 --> 00:03:45,270
Shibuya

86
00:03:40,300 --> 00:03:45,270
Hamada is heading to a store which sells various styles of fashion.

87
00:03:45,630 --> 00:03:50,440
I can't really imagine her wearing anything too bright.

88
00:03:52,810 --> 00:03:55,910
Hmm... Nah...

89
00:03:56,410 --> 00:03:59,080
Hamada is struggling to find something he likes.

90
00:04:00,490 --> 00:04:02,390
Hmm... I see...

91
00:04:02,390 --> 00:04:06,690
A ___________ kind of look.

92
00:04:06,690 --> 00:04:08,860
This might be good

93
00:04:08,860 --> 00:04:10,430
Do you think she'd wear this to pachinko?

94
00:04:10,430 --> 00:04:13,600
Do you think she'd wear this to pachinko?

95
00:04:10,430 --> 00:04:18,000
Pachinko is a pinball like arcade and gambling machine which uses steel balls as both the currency and playing piece.

96
00:04:15,500 --> 00:04:18,000
What will Hamada choose?

97
00:04:18,340 --> 00:04:23,280
Ginza

98
00:04:18,900 --> 00:04:23,280
Endō is in Ginza, does he have the same image in mind as Hamada?

99
00:04:23,640 --> 00:04:24,740
A bag... I think this is the right sort of idea.

100
00:04:24,740 --> 00:04:27,250
A bag... I think this is the right sort of idea.

101
00:04:27,250 --> 00:04:29,880
These look kinda like pachinko balls.

102
00:04:29,880 --> 00:04:35,150
I really like this, the sleek white with the bright gems.

103
00:04:35,150 --> 00:04:37,320
I seem to really like things with balls.

104
00:04:37,320 --> 00:04:38,720
I seem to really like things with balls.

105
00:04:39,090 --> 00:04:44,730
Harajuku

106
00:04:39,490 --> 00:04:44,730
Hoping to find an accessory,
the always struggling Tanaka heads to Harajuku.

107
00:04:44,840 --> 00:04:48,970
When I was thinking of an accessory to suit Tamao-san

108
00:04:48,970 --> 00:04:52,970
I came up with something straight away.

109
00:04:53,710 --> 00:04:56,470
Tanaka seems to be full of confidence.

110
00:04:57,080 --> 00:04:59,140
This is good, this'll be great.

111
00:04:59,140 --> 00:05:00,750
This is good, this'll be great.

112
00:05:03,010 --> 00:05:04,480
These are cute.

113
00:05:04,480 --> 00:05:07,020
They're pink and nice and feminine.

114
00:05:07,020 --> 00:05:09,790
Do many people buy these?

115
00:05:09,790 --> 00:05:13,460
The light pink colour is a favourite among girls and women

116
00:05:13,460 --> 00:05:16,560
of all ages.

117
00:05:14,890 --> 00:05:16,560
All ages?

118
00:05:16,590 --> 00:05:17,960
and nationalities?

119
00:05:17,230 --> 00:05:17,960
Yes

120
00:05:19,060 --> 00:05:20,430
Thank you so much.

121
00:05:21,230 --> 00:05:23,500
Thanks to you, I have no more hesitations.

122
00:05:23,500 --> 00:05:25,640
Thanks to you, I have no more hesitations.

123
00:05:25,970 --> 00:05:31,140
Ginza

124
00:05:26,710 --> 00:05:31,140
Matsumoto, in search of an accessory, heads to Ginza.

125
00:05:31,140 --> 00:05:32,980
This time definitely feels like it's gonna be the hardest.

126
00:05:32,980 --> 00:05:36,480
This time definitely feels like it's gonna be the hardest.

127
00:05:36,480 --> 00:05:39,050
She's a well known actress.

128
00:05:39,050 --> 00:05:40,920
I can't just get anything, right?

129
00:05:40,950 --> 00:05:43,920
This is by far the toughest one yet.

130
00:05:47,160 --> 00:05:48,060
How about

131
00:05:48,060 --> 00:05:50,030
a Swiss army knife?

132
00:05:50,030 --> 00:05:52,900
I can't just think of it like I'm buying something for my mother.

133
00:05:52,900 --> 00:05:56,800
I can't just think of it like I'm buying something for my mother.

134
00:05:56,800 --> 00:06:00,170
Matsumoto just can't find what he's looking for.

135
00:06:00,170 --> 00:06:01,810
Then... suddenly...

136
00:06:01,810 --> 00:06:03,880
Maybe...

137
00:06:09,710 --> 00:06:11,820
What do you think?

138
00:06:11,820 --> 00:06:14,890
Innovative, right?

139
00:06:14,890 --> 00:06:17,360
It may be unexpected.

140
00:06:14,890 --> 00:06:17,360
Staff

141
00:06:18,190 --> 00:06:22,330
With that, the 5 members finish up their shopping trip.

142
00:06:22,400 --> 00:06:27,430
This time, we've gone and bought a top and an accessory we think you'll like.

143
00:06:28,970 --> 00:06:30,570
I love shopping!

144
00:06:31,270 --> 00:06:33,370
No, I just explained that we went...

145
00:06:33,370 --> 00:06:35,910
Hamada-san!

146
00:06:36,270 --> 00:06:39,010
No, Tamao-san isn't shopping

147
00:06:39,010 --> 00:06:41,410
You're not going, we went for you.

148
00:06:41,450 --> 00:06:43,680
I still like shopping!

149
00:06:50,990 --> 00:06:56,860
Subbed by Inepped

150
00:06:50,990 --> 00:06:56,860
This is a free fansub
Please support the official release

151
00:06:58,000 --> 00:07:02,030
Gaki members are presenting items they think will suit our guest.

152
00:07:02,670 --> 00:07:10,680
As usual, our guest, Nakamura Tamao, will take home her favourite item. The member with the worst item will have to pay for their item.

153
00:07:11,110 --> 00:07:15,180
First up, a top that will suit Nakamura Tamao.

154
00:07:16,010 --> 00:07:20,650
First up is Endō, but what sort of top has he chosen?

155
00:07:20,820 --> 00:07:22,120
Go Shōzo!

156
00:07:22,120 --> 00:07:23,960
Nice to meet you, I'm Cocorico's Endō.

157
00:07:24,590 --> 00:07:26,420
This is gonna be a disappointment.

158
00:07:26,420 --> 00:07:30,630
I was thinking of Tamao-san and picked this out.

159
00:07:30,650 --> 00:07:33,000
Open it up please Tamao-san.

160
00:07:37,980 --> 00:07:39,770
Eh... her face just...

161
00:07:41,040 --> 00:07:46,040
(£38/$55)

162
00:07:41,040 --> 00:07:46,040
Price conversions are approximate for time of airing.

163
00:07:41,870 --> 00:07:42,970
Oh no!

164
00:07:43,780 --> 00:07:44,970
No no no!

165
00:07:44,970 --> 00:07:46,380
Endō!

166
00:07:47,250 --> 00:07:48,510
Endō, come on man!

167
00:07:48,510 --> 00:07:51,320
Totally wrong!!

168
00:07:49,480 --> 00:07:51,320
Yep, this is totally off!!

169
00:07:51,700 --> 00:07:55,990
I think it's a little similar to what you have on, light.

170
00:07:56,020 --> 00:08:03,090
I was thinking about what you could wear anytime and I think a cardigan is a good choice.

171
00:08:03,090 --> 00:08:06,300
Because I know you like pachinko...

172
00:08:06,560 --> 00:08:08,900
I also picked thinking about that.

173
00:08:09,030 --> 00:08:10,900
The balls?

174
00:08:09,470 --> 00:08:11,470
The image of the balls...

175
00:08:11,470 --> 00:08:14,810
Are they supposed to represent pachinko balls?

176
00:08:15,480 --> 00:08:17,080
This is just in poor taste.

177
00:08:17,080 --> 00:08:20,180
I just seems like it's in poor taste.

178
00:08:20,180 --> 00:08:22,080
Don't you think it suits her?

179
00:08:22,380 --> 00:08:23,680
This is wrong.

180
00:08:23,680 --> 00:08:25,680
I think it really suits her...

181
00:08:26,280 --> 00:08:28,950
When you think of her first reaction, she didn't seem that into it.

182
00:08:27,850 --> 00:08:28,950
Her reaction was...

183
00:08:28,950 --> 00:08:30,860
When you think of her first reaction, she didn't seem that into it.

184
00:08:29,550 --> 00:08:30,860
Yes yes yes

185
00:08:30,860 --> 00:08:33,290
That's true... You didn't seem to be too enthused.

186
00:08:33,490 --> 00:08:35,260
You won't know, you won't know.

187
00:08:36,760 --> 00:08:38,660
I...

188
00:08:38,660 --> 00:08:39,730
She's an actress, so of course she's got a perfect poker face.

189
00:08:39,730 --> 00:08:42,030
She's an actress, so of course she's got a perfect poker face.

190
00:08:42,070 --> 00:08:44,100
That's what I want you to think.

191
00:08:48,050 --> 00:08:52,640
Next up to present his top to Nakamura Tamao is Hamada.

192
00:08:52,810 --> 00:08:55,610
Like Endō was saying, I wanted something

193
00:08:55,610 --> 00:08:57,450
something comfortable and easy to wear when playing pachinko.

194
00:08:57,450 --> 00:08:58,850
something comfortable and easy to wear when playing pachinko.

195
00:08:58,850 --> 00:09:02,550
Everyone seems to be focusing on pachinko.

196
00:09:01,620 --> 00:09:03,560
Focusing too much on that.

197
00:09:03,610 --> 00:09:05,490
Eh, Hamada-san?!

198
00:09:09,130 --> 00:09:09,660
What is it?

199
00:09:09,660 --> 00:09:12,060
A lightweight bomber jacket.

200
00:09:09,660 --> 00:09:12,060
It's an MA-1.

201
00:09:12,060 --> 00:09:13,060
I'm not so sure...

202
00:09:12,400 --> 00:09:17,570
£31/$44

203
00:09:13,060 --> 00:09:15,400
What do you think, it's good for pachinko, right?

204
00:09:15,390 --> 00:09:17,140
The size is perfect but...

205
00:09:16,980 --> 00:09:19,140
It's good, right?

206
00:09:17,600 --> 00:09:19,640
I'm not sure...

207
00:09:26,380 --> 00:09:30,480
Do you normally wear jeans to pachinko?

208
00:09:27,810 --> 00:09:30,480
I do.

209
00:09:29,250 --> 00:09:30,480
So quiet.

210
00:09:30,480 --> 00:09:32,150
So you do wear jeans normally!

211
00:09:35,020 --> 00:09:35,990
Hamada-san

212
00:09:35,990 --> 00:09:39,820
At first I was also looking at an MA-1.

213
00:09:38,560 --> 00:09:39,820
Really?!

214
00:09:39,820 --> 00:09:40,890
Then I thought, nah, this isn't it!

215
00:09:40,890 --> 00:09:44,500
Then I thought, nah, this isn't it!

216
00:09:42,290 --> 00:09:45,130
Stop messing with me!!

217
00:09:47,210 --> 00:09:51,940
Not convinced of Hamada's choice, what did Tanaka go with?

218
00:09:51,970 --> 00:09:53,200
C'mon then Tanaka!

219
00:09:54,370 --> 00:09:55,510
Please be kind.

220
00:09:57,210 --> 00:09:58,810
Thank you

221
00:09:58,810 --> 00:09:59,680
Here

222
00:09:59,680 --> 00:10:01,710
Thank you

223
00:10:06,820 --> 00:10:10,090
Self-defence forces.

224
00:10:06,820 --> 00:10:10,090
The Japan Self-Defense Forces (JSDF) are the unified military forces of Japan.

225
00:10:10,090 --> 00:10:11,790
Apologise!

226
00:10:12,120 --> 00:10:18,130
£28/$40

227
00:10:18,130 --> 00:10:20,300
That Japanese style image...

228
00:10:19,130 --> 00:10:20,300
No! No!

229
00:10:20,300 --> 00:10:21,300
As soon as she opened the bag, she said "Self-defence forces"

230
00:10:21,300 --> 00:10:24,570
As soon as she opened the bag, she said "Self-defence forces"

231
00:10:24,570 --> 00:10:25,240
That's definitely a bad sign!!

232
00:10:25,240 --> 00:10:26,940
That's definitely a bad sign!!

233
00:10:26,600 --> 00:10:28,210
It's called camouflage.

234
00:10:27,670 --> 00:10:28,940
Camouflage?

235
00:10:30,610 --> 00:10:32,210
She's quick to take it off!

236
00:10:32,380 --> 00:10:33,280
It's light!

237
00:10:33,280 --> 00:10:35,810
She's already done with it.

238
00:10:35,890 --> 00:10:36,980
She's young

239
00:10:36,980 --> 00:10:37,850
I think Tamao-san has a youthful image.

240
00:10:37,850 --> 00:10:39,180
I think Tamao-san has a youthful image.

241
00:10:39,370 --> 00:10:41,020
It's whether Tamao-san likes it or not.

242
00:10:41,120 --> 00:10:45,290
That's why I think, although different, this is something that Tamao-san will like.

243
00:10:45,780 --> 00:10:50,760
Fourth to present his top to Nakamura Tamao, is Matsumoto.

244
00:10:50,800 --> 00:10:52,560
Matsumoto-san, you're up.

245
00:10:53,330 --> 00:10:56,670
You often wear jeans right?

246
00:11:02,040 --> 00:11:02,870
No matter what, people usually picture you in traditional Japanese clothes.

247
00:11:02,870 --> 00:11:05,840
No matter what, people usually picture you in traditional Japanese clothes.

248
00:11:05,840 --> 00:11:08,580
But what Tamao-san actually likes...

249
00:11:08,580 --> 00:11:10,880
Is Rock.

250
00:11:13,480 --> 00:11:20,220
£49/$70

251
00:11:15,890 --> 00:11:18,260
Isn't this perfect?!

252
00:11:17,660 --> 00:11:19,190
Definitely not.

253
00:11:18,260 --> 00:11:20,060
This is perfect!!

254
00:11:20,220 --> 00:11:22,360
Could you imagine her walking around in this!?

255
00:11:22,360 --> 00:11:24,060
You totally could!

256
00:11:24,060 --> 00:11:26,060
I can't see her wearing this!

257
00:11:26,060 --> 00:11:26,900
The yellow...

258
00:11:26,900 --> 00:11:28,870
The yellow colour makes it.

259
00:11:28,130 --> 00:11:29,830
The yellow does, huh?

260
00:11:29,830 --> 00:11:32,800
You could see her showing up in this, "Good morning!"

261
00:11:32,800 --> 00:11:35,310
It wouldn't look out of place at all.

262
00:11:36,040 --> 00:11:40,810
Well you may think that Matsumoto-san, but Tamao-san might not.

263
00:11:40,810 --> 00:11:43,550
As soon as I saw this I thought 'This is it!'

264
00:11:44,750 --> 00:11:46,380
You wear jeans, right?

265
00:11:46,380 --> 00:11:47,450
YES

266
00:11:48,420 --> 00:11:49,750
She's just responding 'YES'

267
00:11:49,220 --> 00:11:51,190
Why are you suddenly only saying 'YES'?

268
00:11:51,860 --> 00:11:54,730
This is heavy isn't it Tamao-san?

269
00:11:54,730 --> 00:11:56,630
The other's are much lighter.

270
00:11:56,630 --> 00:12:00,830
Those one's all look lame, you don't need that bland colouring.

271
00:12:00,830 --> 00:12:02,970
This is a clear cut yellow.

272
00:12:02,970 --> 00:12:05,340
You'll definitely like this.

273
00:12:03,870 --> 00:12:05,340
YES

274
00:12:05,340 --> 00:12:08,540
She said 'YES!!'

275
00:12:09,040 --> 00:12:14,010
Last up, the member with the most losses to date, is Hōsei.

276
00:12:14,010 --> 00:12:16,850
So far, nobody has paid attention to the season.

277
00:12:17,580 --> 00:12:20,650
I'm looking forward to seeing the accessories.

278
00:12:21,690 --> 00:12:24,290
You don't think these take it into account?

279
00:12:22,650 --> 00:12:25,920
No, who wears a jumper in spring?!

280
00:12:26,820 --> 00:12:29,090
Sparkly

281
00:12:29,590 --> 00:12:32,360
We finally see you smile Tamao-san.

282
00:12:32,130 --> 00:12:33,130
It's sparkly!

283
00:12:34,700 --> 00:12:36,570
I really like sparkly things.

284
00:12:35,870 --> 00:12:41,170
£70/$100

285
00:12:38,690 --> 00:12:41,170
What is this? A sheep?

286
00:12:41,170 --> 00:12:43,570
A unicorn

287
00:12:42,110 --> 00:12:43,570
A unicorn?

288
00:12:43,700 --> 00:12:45,240
An animal?

289
00:12:44,310 --> 00:12:45,240
Yes

290
00:12:45,240 --> 00:12:46,810
An imaginary animal... It's like a horse.

291
00:12:46,810 --> 00:12:48,350
An imaginary animal... It's like a horse.

292
00:12:48,350 --> 00:12:50,950
A happiness horse!!

293
00:12:50,950 --> 00:12:53,750
An imaginary animal...

294
00:12:53,750 --> 00:12:58,090
Handed over by an imaginary comedian.

295
00:12:59,120 --> 00:13:00,490
Where is this from?

296
00:12:59,730 --> 00:13:02,490
Tamao-san, do you really like sparkly things like that?

297
00:13:02,990 --> 00:13:04,800
I really like sparkly things.

298
00:13:04,860 --> 00:13:07,000
Having shiny stuff all down the arms?

299
00:13:07,360 --> 00:13:10,000
Yeah, sparkly stuff is cute, right?

300
00:13:13,300 --> 00:13:14,270
Just now

301
00:13:14,270 --> 00:13:16,170
Tamao-san asked me in a whisper "Where did you get this?"

302
00:13:16,170 --> 00:13:19,180
Tamao-san asked me in a whisper "Where did you get this?"

303
00:13:17,840 --> 00:13:19,180
Let's get this hung up please.

304
00:13:21,350 --> 00:13:25,180
Among these five, which will come out on top!?

305
00:13:25,240 --> 00:13:26,720
Have you finished deciding?

306
00:13:26,720 --> 00:13:27,850
I'm struggling with 1st and 2nd.

307
00:13:27,850 --> 00:13:30,660
I'm struggling with 1st and 2nd.

308
00:13:30,660 --> 00:13:33,790
Endō

309
00:13:30,660 --> 00:13:33,790
Hamada

310
00:13:30,660 --> 00:13:33,790
Hōsei

311
00:13:30,660 --> 00:13:33,790
Matsumoto

312
00:13:30,660 --> 00:13:33,790
Tanaka

313
00:13:31,260 --> 00:13:34,190
There's other things to think about...

314
00:13:34,190 --> 00:13:36,660
I have to take into consideration...

315
00:13:36,660 --> 00:13:38,430
Things like my age...

316
00:13:38,430 --> 00:13:41,900
I'm now 76.

317
00:13:41,900 --> 00:13:45,470
So for that reason...

318
00:13:47,640 --> 00:13:48,640
...That time...

319
00:13:50,370 --> 00:13:51,780
...I'm trying to say...

320
00:13:50,910 --> 00:13:53,480
Well whatever!

321
00:13:56,910 --> 00:13:59,650
She's still speaking!!

322
00:14:01,750 --> 00:14:04,660
Things like sleeves

323
00:14:04,660 --> 00:14:05,660
My arms can become itchy if theres a pattern.

324
00:14:05,660 --> 00:14:07,890
My arms can become itchy if theres a pattern.

325
00:14:06,220 --> 00:14:07,890
I know what you mean!

326
00:14:07,990 --> 00:14:10,900
Like when there's stitching on the inside or something.

327
00:14:11,960 --> 00:14:12,760
Also, I like the colour green!!

328
00:14:12,760 --> 00:14:17,470
Also, I like the colour green!!

329
00:14:14,900 --> 00:14:17,470
That's enough preamble!!

330
00:14:18,740 --> 00:14:19,570
YES

331
00:14:19,300 --> 00:14:24,640
So, Tamao-san, which of these is your favourite?!

332
00:14:24,640 --> 00:14:26,240
I'm sorry to say, it's yours!

333
00:14:26,240 --> 00:14:27,880
I'm sorry to say, it's yours!

334
00:14:28,250 --> 00:14:30,580
Sorry to say?

335
00:14:32,220 --> 00:14:34,020
Despite your meanness.

336
00:14:36,420 --> 00:14:38,290
It's light!

337
00:14:38,320 --> 00:14:39,390
It's light!

338
00:14:39,440 --> 00:14:42,190
But you weren't totally sure about Hamada-san's?

339
00:14:42,330 --> 00:14:44,960
I really didn't want it to be Hamada-san.

340
00:14:45,930 --> 00:14:48,530
To be honest, I really liked this one too.

341
00:14:48,830 --> 00:14:50,030
But

342
00:14:50,030 --> 00:14:52,840
It's too heavy, at my age.

343
00:14:54,240 --> 00:14:57,440
Between you two...

344
00:14:58,340 --> 00:15:00,910
I'm not just flattering you but

345
00:15:00,910 --> 00:15:04,280
I liked both of yours.

346
00:15:04,680 --> 00:15:06,980
You should like mine too!!

347
00:15:09,050 --> 00:15:11,020
Which one is in third place?

348
00:15:12,560 --> 00:15:14,830
We've got first, second, which is third?

349
00:15:14,830 --> 00:15:15,930
In third is...

350
00:15:15,930 --> 00:15:17,360
Sparkly.

351
00:15:18,830 --> 00:15:19,960
Eh, really?

352
00:15:20,280 --> 00:15:21,130
Sparkly!

353
00:15:21,500 --> 00:15:25,900
Eh, but I thought you liked green?

354
00:15:22,900 --> 00:15:25,900
I do like green, yes.

355
00:15:27,840 --> 00:15:31,840
So, which of these will end up in last place!?

356
00:15:31,890 --> 00:15:34,880
So, we're down to our last two.

357
00:15:34,880 --> 00:15:36,750
Which is the worst?

358
00:15:36,750 --> 00:15:37,550
Because it's cold, this one.

359
00:15:37,550 --> 00:15:39,020
Because it's cold, this one.

360
00:15:42,850 --> 00:15:44,960
Cocorico is just truly the worst!!

361
00:15:45,820 --> 00:15:47,430
I don't want to...

362
00:15:47,430 --> 00:15:48,730
I don't want to join the Self-defence forces! It's scary!

363
00:15:48,730 --> 00:15:51,930
I don't want to join the Self-defence forces! It's scary!

364
00:15:53,000 --> 00:15:57,170
Once again in last, Tanaka has to pay out 4,602 yen!! (£28/$40)

365
00:15:57,800 --> 00:16:01,670
Next up, an accessory to suit Tamao.

366
00:16:02,270 --> 00:16:07,140
First up is Hōsei who surprised us with his top choice.

367
00:16:07,140 --> 00:16:09,250
You picked well earlier.

368
00:16:07,880 --> 00:16:09,250
Yeah Hōsei-san.

369
00:16:09,250 --> 00:16:13,320
I went around loads of places and

370
00:16:13,320 --> 00:16:14,120
this was a must have item in loads of shops.

371
00:16:14,120 --> 00:16:17,490
this was a must have item in loads of shops.

372
00:16:16,240 --> 00:16:16,650
Really?

373
00:16:16,650 --> 00:16:17,490
Yeah

374
00:16:17,490 --> 00:16:18,890
It's a more decorative item.

375
00:16:19,090 --> 00:16:20,890
For the older age group?

376
00:16:20,200 --> 00:16:20,890
That's right.

377
00:16:23,730 --> 00:16:26,000
I think Tamao-san will love this.

378
00:16:27,670 --> 00:16:29,830
See, look at that smile!

379
00:16:29,830 --> 00:16:30,740
What's that?!

380
00:16:30,000 --> 00:16:34,110
£32/$46

381
00:16:30,740 --> 00:16:33,430
Oda Mudo, (1952-2020) was an eccentric Japanese monk and talent.

382
00:16:30,740 --> 00:16:34,110
It's Oda Mudo.

383
00:16:33,140 --> 00:16:34,670
It's pretty.

384
00:16:34,670 --> 00:16:38,110
Ah, but she said it was pretty...

385
00:16:40,380 --> 00:16:42,210
Earlier you were saying how much

386
00:16:42,210 --> 00:16:45,980
you hated wearing heavy things!

387
00:16:45,980 --> 00:16:48,350
This is definitely heavy!!

388
00:16:48,350 --> 00:16:50,350
How about trying it on?

389
00:16:53,260 --> 00:16:54,930
This is actually quite light.

390
00:16:55,360 --> 00:16:56,990
There's no way it's light.

391
00:16:56,990 --> 00:17:00,030
This is definitely heavier than my jacket.

392
00:17:02,440 --> 00:17:02,960
It's great.

393
00:17:04,710 --> 00:17:06,800
You're tired, right?

394
00:17:06,800 --> 00:17:08,800
This is the best.

395
00:17:10,310 --> 00:17:12,710
This is just boring, it's not even funny.

396
00:17:12,710 --> 00:17:14,850
This is just boring, it's not even funny.

397
00:17:14,850 --> 00:17:20,080
玉 (Tama) can mean 'ball' or 'gem'

398
00:17:15,480 --> 00:17:17,180
I focused on the Tama of Tamao-san.

399
00:17:17,180 --> 00:17:20,080
I focused on the Tama of Tamao-san.

400
00:17:20,080 --> 00:17:22,080
It's full of meaning.

401
00:17:22,250 --> 00:17:23,550
After wearing it

402
00:17:23,550 --> 00:17:25,890
it's not actually that heavy.

403
00:17:28,730 --> 00:17:29,630
I don't like seeing Tamao-san so placid.

404
00:17:29,630 --> 00:17:32,530
I don't like seeing Tamao-san so placid.

405
00:17:33,240 --> 00:17:38,040
Next up is Endō, what has he chosen?

406
00:17:38,240 --> 00:17:39,040
Who's up?

407
00:17:38,900 --> 00:17:40,140
It's my turn.

408
00:17:41,670 --> 00:17:45,810
This one was tough, I looked around loads.

409
00:17:46,240 --> 00:17:51,180
£66/$95

410
00:17:46,480 --> 00:17:47,810
It's a hat, but...

411
00:17:47,810 --> 00:17:51,180
I spent my time selecting the right one.

412
00:17:52,480 --> 00:17:55,120
It looks great, it really suits you.

413
00:17:57,090 --> 00:17:59,220
I don't really have any hats.

414
00:17:59,220 --> 00:18:03,390
Is there a reason you don't?

415
00:18:01,030 --> 00:18:03,390
They're itchy.

416
00:18:03,390 --> 00:18:04,800
Then a hat's a definite no go!

417
00:18:08,870 --> 00:18:12,240
Everything's either itchy or heavy!

418
00:18:13,100 --> 00:18:17,710
Next up, the winner of the first round, Hamada.

419
00:18:17,710 --> 00:18:22,010
This is always a solid pick for an accessory.

420
00:18:20,080 --> 00:18:20,980
What is it?

421
00:18:23,550 --> 00:18:24,850
Sunglasses?

422
00:18:24,920 --> 00:18:28,650
Thinking about it, you could easily go wrong...

423
00:18:28,650 --> 00:18:31,660
They're pretty fashionable.

424
00:18:31,660 --> 00:18:34,390
It's all about the wearer.

425
00:18:34,830 --> 00:18:35,960
They're massive!!

426
00:18:36,190 --> 00:18:37,700
Huge!!

427
00:18:38,560 --> 00:18:40,300
The size is way off!!

428
00:18:40,300 --> 00:18:44,870
You look like a dodgy fortune teller.

429
00:18:45,600 --> 00:18:50,310
Last in the previous round, what sort of accessory will Tanaka present?

430
00:18:50,310 --> 00:18:52,310
You're up 'Zero sense'!

431
00:18:57,620 --> 00:18:59,420
Stop giving me stupid nicknames.

432
00:19:01,850 --> 00:19:02,890
How pretty.

433
00:19:02,880 --> 00:19:04,920
See!

434
00:19:04,920 --> 00:19:06,460
How is my sense now!

435
00:19:06,160 --> 00:19:09,860
£66/$95

436
00:19:07,960 --> 00:19:09,960
I've never worn anything like this.

437
00:19:09,960 --> 00:19:11,400
Why is that?

438
00:19:11,800 --> 00:19:15,030
They look like they'll be heavy.

439
00:19:14,030 --> 00:19:17,030
They aren't, try lifting them.

440
00:19:17,270 --> 00:19:18,240
You'll see when you wear them, they're super heavy.

441
00:19:18,240 --> 00:19:22,040
You'll see when you wear them, they're super heavy.

442
00:19:19,400 --> 00:19:22,040
It'll be like wearing iron geta.

443
00:19:19,400 --> 00:19:26,180
Geta are traditional Japanese footwear resembling flip-flops usually made of wood.

444
00:19:22,040 --> 00:19:24,540
They look cool.

445
00:19:24,540 --> 00:19:26,640
The sakura blossom pattern is great.

446
00:19:28,180 --> 00:19:29,550
Don't I look a little odd wearing them?

447
00:19:29,550 --> 00:19:31,780
Don't I look a little odd wearing them?

448
00:19:31,780 --> 00:19:34,650
Very odd.

449
00:19:36,290 --> 00:19:37,760
It pains me to say it!

450
00:19:40,520 --> 00:19:41,630
Tamao-san, you should say how much you hate them!

451
00:19:41,630 --> 00:19:45,660
Tamao-san, you should say how much you hate them!

452
00:19:46,130 --> 00:19:47,700
That's alright.

453
00:19:47,800 --> 00:19:49,700
I've already made up my mind.

454
00:19:54,170 --> 00:19:57,810
'I Think You'll Like this Item!'

455
00:19:58,880 --> 00:20:03,280
Last up to present his item is Matsumoto.

456
00:20:03,410 --> 00:20:05,120
I don't think Tanaka was a million miles off.

457
00:20:05,120 --> 00:20:08,150
I don't think Tanaka was a million miles off.

458
00:20:06,980 --> 00:20:08,150
To the one before?

459
00:20:10,710 --> 00:20:12,790
But he was laughing at mine...

460
00:20:11,520 --> 00:20:14,730
When thinking of one item for someone...

461
00:20:15,630 --> 00:20:17,390
Think of hobbies.

462
00:20:18,700 --> 00:20:20,230
What is that!?

463
00:20:20,360 --> 00:20:26,570
£99/$142

464
00:20:21,170 --> 00:20:23,630
This guy has no dignity at all.

465
00:20:24,700 --> 00:20:26,570
It's a swimsuit.

466
00:20:26,570 --> 00:20:29,840
It reminds me of my husband.

467
00:20:28,210 --> 00:20:29,840
It reminded you of your husband?

468
00:20:29,840 --> 00:20:32,880
Isn't that wonderful!!

469
00:20:31,680 --> 00:20:33,940
That reminds you of Katsu Shintarō-san?

470
00:20:31,680 --> 00:20:39,080
Katsu Shintarō (1931–1997) was a Japanese actor, singer, and filmmaker.

471
00:20:32,940 --> 00:20:33,940
How does that...

472
00:20:33,940 --> 00:20:35,010
This is the greatest thing I've ever done!!

473
00:20:35,010 --> 00:20:36,610
This is the greatest thing I've ever done!!

474
00:20:36,880 --> 00:20:37,450
I MADE HER THINK OF HER HUSBAND!!

475
00:20:37,450 --> 00:20:39,080
I MADE HER THINK OF HER HUSBAND!!

476
00:20:41,950 --> 00:20:43,350
When we went to Hawaii, he bought me a swimsuit like this.

477
00:20:43,350 --> 00:20:46,390
When we went to Hawaii, he bought me a swimsuit like this.

478
00:20:46,390 --> 00:20:47,560
But in the end, I didn't wear it.

479
00:20:47,560 --> 00:20:50,930
But in the end, I didn't wear it.

480
00:20:48,790 --> 00:20:52,930
That's ok, you can now fulfill that dream.

481
00:20:53,830 --> 00:20:55,730
In the pool or whatever.

482
00:20:54,670 --> 00:20:55,730
I see.

483
00:20:55,730 --> 00:20:59,870
The sneakers and that are just...

484
00:20:59,870 --> 00:21:02,410
A swimsuit is a proper item.

485
00:21:03,340 --> 00:21:04,540
You can remember your husband as you're frolicking in the water.

486
00:21:04,540 --> 00:21:07,380
You can remember your husband as you're frolicking in the water.

487
00:21:09,380 --> 00:21:13,350
So, which of these will be her favourite!?

488
00:21:13,350 --> 00:21:18,590
Amongst these, which is your favourite!?

489
00:21:18,620 --> 00:21:21,630
Endō

490
00:21:18,620 --> 00:21:21,630
Hamada

491
00:21:18,620 --> 00:21:21,630
Hōsei

492
00:21:18,620 --> 00:21:21,630
Matsumoto

493
00:21:18,620 --> 00:21:21,630
Tanaka

494
00:21:19,290 --> 00:21:20,420
YEA...

495
00:21:23,360 --> 00:21:25,260
She sure likes teasing us with this.

496
00:21:25,960 --> 00:21:32,400
Endō

497
00:21:25,960 --> 00:21:32,400
Hamada

498
00:21:25,960 --> 00:21:32,400
Hōsei

499
00:21:25,960 --> 00:21:32,400
Matsumoto

500
00:21:25,960 --> 00:21:32,400
Tanaka

501
00:21:36,140 --> 00:21:39,440
I'm looking forward to wearing these.

502
00:21:39,440 --> 00:21:41,350
I get to keep these, right?

503
00:21:40,540 --> 00:21:41,350
Of course.

504
00:21:41,350 --> 00:21:43,480
Why did you choose these?

505
00:21:42,550 --> 00:21:44,350
Why?

506
00:21:44,350 --> 00:21:47,020
Because I like them.

507
00:21:47,450 --> 00:21:49,020
Pretty simple reasoning.

508
00:21:52,560 --> 00:21:54,160
Back home I...

509
00:21:52,560 --> 00:21:59,530
Here, Tamao-san mistakingly says uchi instead of ie. They're very similar in meaning, kind of like うち(uchi) “home” and いえ(ie) “house”, but in this context sounds a little strange.

510
00:21:54,850 --> 00:21:56,260
You mean back at my house.

511
00:22:00,200 --> 00:22:03,600
So, Tamao-san, please pick out second place.

512
00:22:03,600 --> 00:22:05,740
Let's go for simplicity, ok?

513
00:22:03,600 --> 00:22:09,410
Endō

514
00:22:03,600 --> 00:22:09,410
Hamada

515
00:22:03,600 --> 00:22:09,410
Hōsei

516
00:22:03,600 --> 00:22:09,410
Matsumoto

517
00:22:10,540 --> 00:22:12,410
I want to take this too.

518
00:22:12,440 --> 00:22:15,450
It's a little heavy... I don't have anything like this.

519
00:22:15,450 --> 00:22:16,680
It's a little heavy... I don't have anything like this.

520
00:22:16,780 --> 00:22:18,920
So Tamao-san, in third place is?

521
00:22:20,050 --> 00:22:23,590
Endō

522
00:22:20,050 --> 00:22:23,590
Hamada

523
00:22:20,050 --> 00:22:23,590
Matsumoto

524
00:22:20,260 --> 00:22:27,190
I kind of want this just to destroy it, but at least it's nostalgic.

525
00:22:32,030 --> 00:22:36,730
So, which of these items will come in last!?

526
00:22:37,970 --> 00:22:42,740
Which of these items does Nakamura Tamao dislike the most!?

527
00:22:42,880 --> 00:22:44,810
Which one comes in last place?

528
00:22:44,810 --> 00:22:46,440
Endō

529
00:22:44,810 --> 00:22:46,440
Hamada

530
00:22:44,940 --> 00:22:45,980
In last place...

531
00:22:45,980 --> 00:22:47,680
Because it's itchy.

532
00:22:49,450 --> 00:22:54,520
No matter where I go, I will never find a use for a hat.

533
00:22:54,520 --> 00:22:58,720
This was a complete waste of money.

534
00:23:01,490 --> 00:23:05,200
Endō has to pay a large penalty of 10,800 yen (£66/$95)!!

535
00:23:05,290 --> 00:23:06,000
Just a moment...

536
00:23:06,000 --> 00:23:09,430
Hamada-san, how much did you pay for those sunglasses?

537
00:23:09,430 --> 00:23:11,400
500 yen (£3/$4)

538
00:23:11,400 --> 00:23:13,140
No way!

539
00:23:13,300 --> 00:23:16,670
It's a good job you didn't lose then.

540
00:23:16,920 --> 00:23:19,980
It must have been tiring searching for these things.

541
00:23:19,980 --> 00:23:24,210
Well, you get to take home your favourite items of the day.

542
00:23:25,180 --> 00:23:26,320
What were they?

543
00:23:26,320 --> 00:23:28,520
