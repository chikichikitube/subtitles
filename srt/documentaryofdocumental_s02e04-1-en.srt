Subbed by Thanos-no-Tsukai
Thanks For Watching!

2
00:00:24,440 --> 00:00:26,010
Open up, open up, open up!

3
00:00:26,340 --> 00:00:27,780
Stop it, stop it!

4
00:00:27,840 --> 00:00:30,350
Stop it, come on, come on

5
00:00:30,410 --> 00:00:31,950
They stood right up!

6
00:00:32,580 --> 00:00:33,580
Thank you so much!

7
00:00:33,780 --> 00:00:35,050
Thank you very much

8
00:00:35,120 --> 00:00:36,250
Alright

9
00:00:36,320 --> 00:00:37,450
Huh?

10
00:00:40,160 --> 00:00:42,460
There was nothing wrong

11
00:00:43,490 --> 00:00:44,730
Nothing, right?

12
00:00:45,060 --> 00:00:46,730
Nothing at all!

13
00:00:58,640 --> 00:00:59,980
I'm gonna order some food

14
00:01:00,040 --> 00:01:00,940
Let's get sushi!

15
00:01:01,910 --> 00:01:03,780
You can order that?

16
00:01:04,580 --> 00:01:05,880
Here's the list (of menu items)

17
00:01:07,580 --> 00:01:09,520
Calm down! What the fuck man?

18
00:01:10,090 --> 00:01:11,050
What happened?

19
00:01:11,920 --> 00:01:13,060
He's too rough

20
00:01:13,460 --> 00:01:15,220
I really want some soba, let's order some

21
00:01:15,290 --> 00:01:16,460
Soba sounds good

22
00:01:16,590 --> 00:01:18,590
We could also get pizza. You want soba?

23
00:01:19,330 --> 00:01:21,660
We could get the big one.

24
00:01:21,760 --> 00:01:23,300
Is that just for two people?

25
00:01:23,370 --> 00:01:24,770
We can eat this?

26
00:01:24,830 --> 00:01:26,970
We could get Mutsuki
and some soba too

27
00:01:28,600 --> 00:01:30,140
Why soba anyways?

28
00:01:35,740 --> 00:01:36,680
Watch out!

29
00:01:37,380 --> 00:01:40,150
Pull on your chin...

30
00:01:41,350 --> 00:01:42,480
One, two...

31
00:01:43,390 --> 00:01:44,990
He's pulling on his chin!

32
00:01:45,050 --> 00:01:46,260
Ouch!

33
00:01:48,320 --> 00:01:49,730
This is Yoroku Soba!

34
00:01:49,790 --> 00:01:51,630
Ah, Yoroku Soba?

35
00:01:52,160 --> 00:01:54,060
I'd like to order
some soba

36
00:01:54,130 --> 00:01:56,770
Understood.
What's your order?

37
00:01:56,830 --> 00:01:58,370
Also, you guys
have combos, right?

38
00:01:58,970 --> 00:02:02,240
Yes, we do.
We have various different ones.

39
00:02:02,670 --> 00:02:04,340
He's getting closer.

40
00:02:07,780 --> 00:02:09,280
Can we get a tamago bowl combo?

41
00:02:09,350 --> 00:02:10,610
There he is!

42
00:02:11,510 --> 00:02:13,550
An egg bowl combo, right?

43
00:02:14,450 --> 00:02:17,220
I do look the part, huh?

44
00:02:18,820 --> 00:02:22,090
But I've always hated that.

45
00:02:23,130 --> 00:02:24,190
You do?

46
00:02:24,690 --> 00:02:28,630
They think I'm serious
but it's just for fashion.

47
00:02:29,700 --> 00:02:32,400
They really think
I'm a genuine soldier.

48
00:02:33,600 --> 00:02:34,570
Is it the way you walk?

49
00:02:34,640 --> 00:02:37,510
They think I'm serious
but it's just for fashion.

50
00:02:37,570 --> 00:02:39,380
I even look the part
right now, right?

51
00:02:39,440 --> 00:02:41,340
Aren't you actually
happy about that?

52
00:02:41,410 --> 00:02:43,380
No, I wear camouflage
just for fashion.

53
00:02:43,450 --> 00:02:44,810
It's just fashion.

54
00:02:44,910 --> 00:02:46,150
Shut up!

55
00:02:46,650 --> 00:02:48,380
Nadal is so battered.

56
00:02:49,550 --> 00:02:51,220
You shut up, man.

57
00:02:51,920 --> 00:02:54,060
I didn't understand
what he was saying.

58
00:02:54,120 --> 00:02:55,460
You hung up?!

59
00:02:55,690 --> 00:02:56,690
Why?!

60
00:02:56,760 --> 00:02:57,930
You had to wait
not hang up.

61
00:02:58,230 --> 00:02:59,300
You suck man!

62
00:02:59,400 --> 00:03:01,060
You can't hang up on people.

63
00:03:01,360 --> 00:03:02,300
Are you a soldier?

64
00:03:02,360 --> 00:03:05,530
I'm not a soldier. I'm really just
wearing this for fashion.

65
00:03:05,800 --> 00:03:08,040
People think
camouflage is always serious.

66
00:03:08,100 --> 00:03:11,910
They think I'm a soldier.
I want it for the style.

67
00:03:11,970 --> 00:03:14,210
But they always
look at me like that!

68
00:03:14,340 --> 00:03:16,380
I just wear it for fashion!

69
00:03:16,450 --> 00:03:17,880
They think I look the part!

70
00:03:18,950 --> 00:03:20,420
I hate it! I've had enough!

71
00:03:20,480 --> 00:03:23,090
It's always like that
for everything!

72
00:03:23,890 --> 00:03:25,350
Nobody sees it as fashion!

73
00:03:26,160 --> 00:03:27,320
It's always the same!

74
00:03:27,990 --> 00:03:29,860
No matter what I wear

75
00:03:30,290 --> 00:03:31,930
You can't combine those

76
00:03:32,090 --> 00:03:34,300
I just want it
for fashion!

77
00:03:34,660 --> 00:03:38,130
But they think I'm a real soldier!

78
00:03:39,440 --> 00:03:41,540
I just do it for fashion.

79
00:03:41,970 --> 00:03:44,110
I wanna wear camouflage like everyone else.

80
00:03:44,440 --> 00:03:48,180
But maybe it's my body
or my appearance.

81
00:03:48,240 --> 00:03:49,510
They think I'm for real!

82
00:03:49,580 --> 00:03:52,680
I just wanna wear camouflage
like everybody else!

83
00:03:53,650 --> 00:03:55,420
So what about me...?

84
00:03:55,480 --> 00:03:56,690
I'm so jealous!

85
00:03:56,750 --> 00:03:58,790
But when it's this color...

86
00:03:59,120 --> 00:04:00,960
I don't wanna be a real soldier!

87
00:04:01,020 --> 00:04:02,120
A real soldier?

88
00:04:02,490 --> 00:04:04,590
I guess I'll go with
just black then.

89
00:04:04,660 --> 00:04:05,790
Yeah, that'd work.

90
00:04:05,860 --> 00:04:09,000
I'm gonna stop wearing camouflage!
For real!

91
00:04:09,130 --> 00:04:10,670
Nobody told you to, though.

92
00:04:10,800 --> 00:04:12,530
But everybody thinks
I'm a real soldier!

93
00:04:12,600 --> 00:04:14,970
Is there any other fashion
you like?

94
00:04:15,040 --> 00:04:16,370
Nobody's gonna complain now.

95
00:04:16,440 --> 00:04:17,470
You like black...?

96
00:04:17,540 --> 00:04:21,810
No one's complaining now.
No patterns. I'm over that!

97
00:04:21,880 --> 00:04:23,050
I guess so...

98
00:04:23,350 --> 00:04:25,580
Yeah, it's fine.
Looks good.

99
00:04:25,650 --> 00:04:26,780
That works.

100
00:04:26,880 --> 00:04:30,650
You see, I've always
loved camouflage.

101
00:04:31,620 --> 00:04:33,860
I wanted to fit in
with the young kids.

102
00:04:34,390 --> 00:04:36,330
But I guess I'll go
with a simple black then.

103
00:04:37,190 --> 00:04:39,530
Looking completely normal then.

104
00:04:40,630 --> 00:04:41,800
Yeah, looks good.

105
00:04:42,800 --> 00:04:45,870
It doesn't matter what or how...

106
00:04:45,970 --> 00:04:48,240
I always look like
I'm the one in charge.

107
00:04:49,140 --> 00:04:52,880
I just wanted to wear it
for fashion!

108
00:04:57,780 --> 00:05:00,220
I just wanna look trendy.

109
00:05:00,520 --> 00:05:03,320
Well... I don't know about that.

110
00:05:19,640 --> 00:05:22,670
Why don't you show us
how you applaud too...

111
00:05:22,740 --> 00:05:24,770
Like watching something.

112
00:05:24,940 --> 00:05:26,780
I just wear this for fashion.

113
00:05:26,840 --> 00:05:29,180
But I only look normal
with plain black.

114
00:05:29,240 --> 00:05:30,780
So you just
wear that for fun, right?

115
00:05:30,850 --> 00:05:32,580
I just wear it for fun.
You can tell?

116
00:05:32,650 --> 00:05:34,720
-I look like it, right?
-Please clap.

117
00:05:35,520 --> 00:05:36,890
Well, that's just...

118
00:05:37,520 --> 00:05:38,320
Like this, right?

119
00:05:43,960 --> 00:05:45,660
That's not a warm compress, Jimmy-san.

120
00:05:46,760 --> 00:05:48,700
- Huh?
- It's not a warm compress.

121
00:05:48,860 --> 00:05:50,700
That guy loves food, huh?

122
00:05:54,370 --> 00:05:55,500
I have stiff shoulders.

123
00:05:55,570 --> 00:05:57,110
That's cheese, though.

124
00:05:57,740 --> 00:05:59,410
It's not gonna help.

125
00:05:59,480 --> 00:06:01,140
But it cools me, though.

126
00:06:02,010 --> 00:06:03,450
That's insane.

127
00:06:04,150 --> 00:06:05,510
I'm sorry you look the part, though.

128
00:06:05,580 --> 00:06:07,220
I think it's just the general look.

129
00:06:07,280 --> 00:06:10,090
Like the way I move?
The way I look?

130
00:06:10,590 --> 00:06:11,590
Yeah, all of it.

131
00:06:11,650 --> 00:06:12,920
Your gestures too

132
00:06:12,990 --> 00:06:14,390
What about your speech?

133
00:06:14,460 --> 00:06:15,960
Of course not!

134
00:06:16,020 --> 00:06:18,090
-That's it.
-You're wrong!

135
00:06:18,190 --> 00:06:19,290
It's too much.

136
00:06:20,060 --> 00:06:21,730
Look at the cheese.

137
00:06:22,030 --> 00:06:26,000
Private! You don't put cheese
on your shoulders!

138
00:06:26,070 --> 00:06:27,440
This is a warm compress.

139
00:06:28,340 --> 00:06:29,770
That sounded kinda Korean.

140
00:06:29,840 --> 00:06:33,810
Don't put food...
food on your shoulders.

141
00:06:33,940 --> 00:06:37,610
That's not something
you put on your shoulders!

142
00:06:38,250 --> 00:06:40,320
It really sounds kinda
Korean for some reason.

143
00:06:42,120 --> 00:06:43,490
It's not quite right.

144
00:06:46,020 --> 00:06:47,460
I hate it!

145
00:06:47,690 --> 00:06:48,620
What?

146
00:06:48,760 --> 00:06:49,830
What happened?

147
00:06:50,930 --> 00:06:53,800
I also hate... this body!

148
00:06:56,800 --> 00:07:00,340
It's too hard to wear
a damned tank top!

149
00:07:01,540 --> 00:07:02,840
It looks too good!

150
00:07:02,910 --> 00:07:04,210
What's wrong with that?

151
00:07:05,210 --> 00:07:07,010
I look like Bruce Willis!

152
00:07:07,080 --> 00:07:08,610
Bruce Willis?

153
00:07:09,380 --> 00:07:10,710
I look like him in Die Hard!

154
00:07:10,780 --> 00:07:12,680
Bruce Willis was
that ripped?

155
00:07:13,280 --> 00:07:15,050
He was a little jacked, yeah.

156
00:07:15,250 --> 00:07:18,550
Everyone always tells me
that I look like Bruce Willis!

157
00:07:18,620 --> 00:07:19,760
No one says that.

158
00:07:19,820 --> 00:07:21,490
You never change.

159
00:07:22,120 --> 00:07:23,530
They do!

160
00:07:23,630 --> 00:07:24,660
Nope.

161
00:07:25,190 --> 00:07:27,000
It's serious, man!

162
00:07:27,200 --> 00:07:28,330
It is?

163
00:07:28,530 --> 00:07:29,730
It's serious.

164
00:07:29,800 --> 00:07:30,870
What the hell?!

165
00:07:40,610 --> 00:07:41,780
Why did you laugh?

166
00:07:42,280 --> 00:07:43,880
All on his own.

167
00:07:43,950 --> 00:07:44,850
Why did you laugh?

168
00:07:45,410 --> 00:07:47,180
He laughed at himself.

169
00:07:47,280 --> 00:07:48,420
Nadal is too much.

170
00:07:48,480 --> 00:07:49,420
Why did you laugh?

171
00:07:49,480 --> 00:07:52,290
At his face... at his face.

172
00:07:52,450 --> 00:07:53,720
Because he got really mad.

173
00:07:53,790 --> 00:07:55,520
At his sad face.

174
00:07:55,760 --> 00:07:57,060
You thought I really got mad?

175
00:07:57,130 --> 00:07:58,760
You got careless, Soshina.

176
00:08:00,260 --> 00:08:01,930
He made that sad face...

177
00:08:02,000 --> 00:08:03,630
He thought I was angry.

178
00:08:03,700 --> 00:08:04,700
He looked pitiful.

179
00:08:04,770 --> 00:08:05,970
Huh? You did?

180
00:08:06,030 --> 00:08:07,570
I didn't think it was funny

181
00:08:08,440 --> 00:08:09,870
So you laughed at that?

182
00:08:10,370 --> 00:08:12,010
I just felt sorry for him.

183
00:08:12,810 --> 00:08:14,580
It was a strained face.

184
00:08:15,540 --> 00:08:17,310
It's serious, man!

185
00:08:17,610 --> 00:08:18,610
It is?

186
00:08:18,910 --> 00:08:20,120
It's serious!

187
00:08:20,180 --> 00:08:21,250
What the hell?!

188
00:08:29,060 --> 00:08:30,890
No way you did!

189
00:08:31,930 --> 00:08:33,730
Well, I guess so...

190
00:08:33,800 --> 00:08:36,730
I'm fully aware that what I do
isn't funny at all!

191
00:08:36,800 --> 00:08:37,730
I think it was me!

192
00:08:37,800 --> 00:08:39,700
What was with that face? Seriously...

193
00:08:39,770 --> 00:08:40,800
It was emotional

194
00:08:40,870 --> 00:08:42,040
It really got to you

195
00:08:42,100 --> 00:08:44,070
I'm too good, sorry about that.

196
00:08:44,140 --> 00:08:46,780
You got intense
all of a sudden.

197
00:08:47,140 --> 00:08:48,480
Soshina, yellow

198
00:08:49,210 --> 00:08:50,950
Okay, gotta get into it.

199
00:09:01,890 --> 00:09:02,820
That was serious.

200
00:09:02,890 --> 00:09:03,890
For real.

201
00:09:03,990 --> 00:09:04,930
That was serious.

202
00:09:06,630 --> 00:09:07,530
It's serious!

203
00:09:07,600 --> 00:09:08,700
What the hell?!

204
00:09:15,000 --> 00:09:16,370
Koba-san is too harsh.

205
00:09:16,440 --> 00:09:17,570
I'm pissed.

206
00:09:21,340 --> 00:09:22,710
Go home already!

207
00:09:27,580 --> 00:09:28,950
Alright

208
00:09:30,450 --> 00:09:31,890
Get out already!

209
00:09:32,590 --> 00:09:33,790
For real?

210
00:09:33,860 --> 00:09:34,990
I'm serious!

211
00:09:38,460 --> 00:09:39,900
What's with that guy?

212
00:09:40,400 --> 00:09:41,730
Won't you take that off?

213
00:09:41,800 --> 00:09:43,000
Help me!

214
00:09:44,200 --> 00:09:45,300
Help me!

215
00:09:45,800 --> 00:09:46,870
What's wrong?

216
00:09:47,040 --> 00:09:48,140
Help me

217
00:09:49,710 --> 00:09:52,570
They asked me who I belonged to

218
00:09:53,040 --> 00:09:54,940
I said I'm with Yoshimoto

219
00:09:55,180 --> 00:09:56,650
But they put this on me

220
00:09:56,710 --> 00:09:57,810
Huh?

221
00:09:57,880 --> 00:09:59,610
And then lynched me

222
00:10:00,280 --> 00:10:03,220
And they told me
to bring this to you.

223
00:10:03,550 --> 00:10:04,590
What?

224
00:10:06,520 --> 00:10:07,520
That's scary!

225
00:10:08,160 --> 00:10:09,190
Jimmy-san...

226
00:10:09,360 --> 00:10:10,660
That's bad!

227
00:10:10,730 --> 00:10:12,030
Can you take it out?

228
00:10:13,500 --> 00:10:14,900
That's scary!

229
00:10:15,300 --> 00:10:16,230
Huh?

230
00:10:16,630 --> 00:10:18,670
Whoa! It's a head!

231
00:10:18,770 --> 00:10:19,970
Whoa!!

232
00:10:20,140 --> 00:10:21,200
Huh?

233
00:10:21,700 --> 00:10:23,510
They told me to show this to you.

234
00:10:23,970 --> 00:10:25,110
Whoa!

235
00:10:26,210 --> 00:10:27,810
It has a nametag.

236
00:10:27,880 --> 00:10:29,110
What does it say?

237
00:10:30,180 --> 00:10:31,710
Ryo Tamura. (Editor's Note: 1)

238
00:10:32,750 --> 00:10:34,320
It says Ryo Tamura

239
00:10:35,120 --> 00:10:36,450
It's just one?

240
00:10:36,790 --> 00:10:38,020
There's more

241
00:10:38,290 --> 00:10:41,190
Whoa! Whoa!

242
00:10:41,590 --> 00:10:43,290
That's super scary!

243
00:10:43,360 --> 00:10:45,560
They cut off everything! Eyes, ears!

244
00:10:45,830 --> 00:10:46,960
It still has a nose.

245
00:10:47,100 --> 00:10:48,700
It's got a tag.

246
00:10:50,770 --> 00:10:53,340
Hiroyuki Miyasako.
That's what it says. (EN: 2)

247
00:10:53,400 --> 00:10:54,500
Miyasako-san?

248
00:10:55,540 --> 00:10:56,810
You don't have to...

249
00:10:56,870 --> 00:10:58,040
There's more

250
00:10:58,710 --> 00:11:00,210
Whoa!

251
00:11:00,410 --> 00:11:01,410
What?

252
00:11:01,840 --> 00:11:03,710
This is too much!

253
00:11:04,110 --> 00:11:05,880
Stabbed with a wine opener.

254
00:11:06,520 --> 00:11:08,080
Wait a second!

255
00:11:08,550 --> 00:11:11,950
He was innocent!
Totally innocent!

256
00:11:12,020 --> 00:11:12,920
Who is it?

257
00:11:15,720 --> 00:11:17,360
Nego6-san...

258
00:11:21,130 --> 00:11:22,660
Nadal smiled, right?

259
00:11:26,470 --> 00:11:27,500
Nadal

260
00:11:28,400 --> 00:11:29,700
It was me?

261
00:11:29,840 --> 00:11:31,240
I didn't smile

262
00:11:31,310 --> 00:11:33,380
Who was it?
Come on, stop this.

263
00:11:34,240 --> 00:11:37,010
I know he mentioned Nego6,
but stop it.

264
00:11:37,080 --> 00:11:40,820
I think it's just
psychological at this point.

265
00:11:41,020 --> 00:11:42,950
That's not it, but...

266
00:11:44,050 --> 00:11:45,290
Nadal?

267
00:11:45,990 --> 00:11:50,560
I think I was just
biting too hard and it showed a little.

268
00:11:50,930 --> 00:11:52,990
That's no good, though.

269
00:11:53,400 --> 00:11:56,600
That's what the contest
is all about.

270
00:11:58,600 --> 00:12:00,440
This is too much!

271
00:12:00,840 --> 00:12:02,140
I think this was pretty bad.

272
00:12:02,200 --> 00:12:03,270
Yeah, kinda.

273
00:12:03,340 --> 00:12:04,940
Wait a second!

274
00:12:05,340 --> 00:12:08,640
He was innocent!
Totally innocent!

275
00:12:08,810 --> 00:12:09,950
Who is it?

276
00:12:11,910 --> 00:12:13,320
Nego6-san...

277
00:12:16,220 --> 00:12:17,620
I think that's it!

278
00:12:17,690 --> 00:12:19,050
It counts?

279
00:12:19,820 --> 00:12:23,690
I think it's
mostly because of the timing.

280
00:12:24,490 --> 00:12:25,790
Second one

281
00:12:26,600 --> 00:12:28,430
But I think Koba may be really pissed.

282
00:12:28,500 --> 00:12:30,300
Looking at him in the monitor.

283
00:12:31,370 --> 00:12:33,340
His switch flipped
since Matsumoto-san left

284
00:12:33,540 --> 00:12:35,070
For sure

285
00:12:39,310 --> 00:12:40,880
I think it's kinda common

286
00:12:41,510 --> 00:12:42,910
Come on, focus

287
00:12:42,980 --> 00:12:45,810
Have you seen me get pissed off
on stage?

288
00:12:46,150 --> 00:12:48,750
-Not really...
He laughs the most.

289
00:12:49,280 --> 00:12:51,190
No more chances, Nadal.

290
00:12:51,250 --> 00:12:52,550
You're right, I know.

291
00:12:52,620 --> 00:12:54,760
Calm down for once, Nadal.

292
00:12:59,160 --> 00:13:01,360
It's been a huge bother...

293
00:13:01,660 --> 00:13:03,900
Wait a second, listen to this!

294
00:13:05,370 --> 00:13:06,430
Listen to me!

295
00:13:06,500 --> 00:13:07,800
This is hell.

296
00:13:07,870 --> 00:13:09,700
He looks so bald
when he bows.

297
00:13:09,770 --> 00:13:10,940
This is hell.

298
00:13:12,110 --> 00:13:13,440
A Masso (EN: 3)

299
00:13:13,780 --> 00:13:15,140
A Masso

300
00:13:15,580 --> 00:13:16,710
Their controversy...

301
00:13:16,780 --> 00:13:19,810
They apologized, man!

302
00:13:20,620 --> 00:13:23,080
I asked Anthony
what he thought (EN: 4)

303
00:13:23,220 --> 00:13:25,650
I asked him on Line

304
00:13:26,150 --> 00:13:27,760
About the skin color thing, right?

305
00:13:27,820 --> 00:13:29,590
And then he replied

306
00:13:30,130 --> 00:13:34,500
Give it a break
I'm done playing with little kids.

307
00:13:35,000 --> 00:13:36,160
What does that mean?

308
00:13:36,900 --> 00:13:39,470
When I went to visit my
friend's grandma for summer

309
00:13:39,730 --> 00:13:43,770
she gave shaved ice to my friend.

310
00:13:43,840 --> 00:13:48,240
He came back with it
and spilled it all

311
00:13:48,310 --> 00:13:51,810
That's what he wrote.
He's so mentally strong!

312
00:13:51,950 --> 00:13:53,050
Was it used?

313
00:13:54,680 --> 00:13:56,220
This is serious, Nadal!

314
00:13:56,790 --> 00:13:57,750
It's serious!

315
00:13:57,820 --> 00:13:58,790
What the hell?!

316
00:14:01,620 --> 00:14:04,030
To be honest, I've been
slipping up for a while.

317
00:14:04,090 --> 00:14:06,090
My mental strength is waning.

318
00:14:06,260 --> 00:14:08,630
What's Koba-san's
Nadal Reverse Evolution?

319
00:14:08,830 --> 00:14:10,170
Uh... Sasaki Kensuke (EN: 5)

320
00:14:10,230 --> 00:14:11,200
Change it!

321
00:14:11,930 --> 00:14:13,030
Like earlier

322
00:14:13,200 --> 00:14:15,300
Wait
you think he's serious?

323
00:14:17,440 --> 00:14:18,440
Change it

324
00:14:18,840 --> 00:14:19,910
Try something else.

325
00:14:20,010 --> 00:14:21,240
Koba-san...

326
00:14:21,810 --> 00:14:22,880
Do devolution

327
00:14:28,650 --> 00:14:29,950
Uh...

328
00:14:33,760 --> 00:14:35,060
Devolution...

329
00:14:35,120 --> 00:14:36,290
Uh...

330
00:14:38,090 --> 00:14:39,390
Maybe...

331
00:14:41,330 --> 00:14:44,070
A devolution for Kenkoba-san...

332
00:14:47,340 --> 00:14:48,600
That's enough!

333
00:15:00,020 --> 00:15:01,480
Everyone's going in

334
00:15:02,580 --> 00:15:04,650
Ouch!!

335
00:15:04,750 --> 00:15:07,660
Are you alright, senpai?!
What's wrong?

336
00:15:07,720 --> 00:15:08,990
-It stabbed me.
-What did?

337
00:15:09,060 --> 00:15:10,860
-This right here.
-You did it yourself.

338
00:15:11,260 --> 00:15:12,760
Don't waste our time.

339
00:15:13,960 --> 00:15:15,330
Why do you do that?

340
00:15:16,770 --> 00:15:18,200
Come out, Nadal

341
00:15:18,300 --> 00:15:19,730
He's still there

342
00:15:20,840 --> 00:15:23,970
The company's driver
really hates you, man.

343
00:15:24,470 --> 00:15:26,910
You called him just to
go buy some porn.

344
00:15:28,180 --> 00:15:30,850
He says you should
stop calling him just for that.

345
00:15:33,520 --> 00:15:35,120
Is that mentsuyu? (EN: 6)

346
00:15:35,180 --> 00:15:36,250
Try some

347
00:15:36,450 --> 00:15:38,250
Why don't you drink it then?

348
00:15:38,350 --> 00:15:41,090
It's just that it's good.
Has a good aftertaste.

349
00:15:41,890 --> 00:15:43,190
It's a good aftertaste!

350
00:15:43,290 --> 00:15:44,530
A good aftertaste?

351
00:15:45,260 --> 00:15:46,490
It's a good aftertaste.

352
00:15:47,560 --> 00:15:48,800
Just gulp it down

353
00:15:49,360 --> 00:15:50,970
Make sure you gulp it down.

354
00:15:52,430 --> 00:15:53,800
Gulp it down.

355
00:15:57,810 --> 00:16:00,110
What international bullshit is this?

356
00:16:00,180 --> 00:16:01,680
What kind of retort is that?

357
00:16:09,650 --> 00:16:11,720
What kind of international bullshit is this?!

358
00:16:11,790 --> 00:16:12,920
Wait, what's with that retort?

359
00:16:12,990 --> 00:16:14,190
Drink up!

360
00:16:14,760 --> 00:16:15,960
Just drink it!

361
00:16:16,020 --> 00:16:16,990
Let's make a toast

362
00:16:18,590 --> 00:16:23,260
Ah, don't get pissy!
If you could see yourselves...

363
00:16:24,270 --> 00:16:27,940
Hey, you.
You've sure been quiet...

364
00:16:29,000 --> 00:16:31,670
You know I've been getting fewer jobs
since I won M-1?

365
00:16:31,870 --> 00:16:32,910
Yeah, that happens.

366
00:16:32,970 --> 00:16:34,410
Wait, the fortune teller's here.

367
00:16:35,480 --> 00:16:38,580
Hello. I'm Getters Iida. (EN: 7)

368
00:16:41,920 --> 00:16:44,350
I'll read anything
in your future.

369
00:16:46,290 --> 00:16:49,920
Alright then...
How will the Olympics go?

370
00:16:50,490 --> 00:16:52,460
The Olympics?
Let's measure.

371
00:16:52,530 --> 00:16:53,800
Measure?

372
00:16:54,800 --> 00:16:56,360
That's a weird word to say now.

373
00:16:56,930 --> 00:16:58,070
Measure?

374
00:16:58,830 --> 00:17:00,000
UNO?

375
00:17:00,570 --> 00:17:03,100
My fortune telling
reads "Uro's" six stars.

376
00:17:03,170 --> 00:17:04,110
Uro?

377
00:17:06,540 --> 00:17:08,980
The left and right cards are...

378
00:17:09,780 --> 00:17:11,210
going to be turned.

379
00:17:12,380 --> 00:17:13,380
Green, green.

380
00:17:15,420 --> 00:17:19,250
And the ones inside as well
will get turned.

381
00:17:19,890 --> 00:17:21,060
Green, green

382
00:17:21,120 --> 00:17:22,320
No way!

383
00:17:23,190 --> 00:17:24,330
For real?

384
00:17:24,690 --> 00:17:25,960
The center is...

385
00:17:27,430 --> 00:17:28,760
They're all green.

386
00:17:29,330 --> 00:17:30,570
I'm not getting it

387
00:17:33,740 --> 00:17:34,770
The Olympics will succeed

388
00:17:34,840 --> 00:17:36,000
What the hell?!

389
00:17:49,420 --> 00:17:51,550
-It's a bit dark?
-Huh?!

390
00:17:51,620 --> 00:17:53,150
It's a bit dark

391
00:17:54,420 --> 00:17:55,960
Why're you acting all casual?

392
00:17:56,620 --> 00:17:58,730
You're doing it yourself

393
00:17:59,830 --> 00:18:02,630
Like you're one to talk
while fidgeting with your underwear?

394
00:18:06,970 --> 00:18:08,870
Come on, come on

395
00:18:09,670 --> 00:18:10,670
Do something!

396
00:18:10,740 --> 00:18:12,710
I can't do this anymore

397
00:18:13,580 --> 00:18:15,040
What's with that pathetic look?

398
00:18:16,010 --> 00:18:17,710
Huh?
Ina-chan smiled, right?

399
00:18:17,780 --> 00:18:19,150
He did!

400
00:18:20,850 --> 00:18:22,420
Huh?

401
00:18:23,890 --> 00:18:24,890
What?

402
00:18:25,120 --> 00:18:26,220
Ina-san?

403
00:18:26,790 --> 00:18:27,990
Who was it?

404
00:18:28,490 --> 00:18:29,560
Where?

405
00:18:29,720 --> 00:18:30,760
Inada?

406
00:18:31,860 --> 00:18:33,700
Ina-chan just...

407
00:18:34,000 --> 00:18:35,860
So it was him!

408
00:18:36,800 --> 00:18:39,800
He just smiled
like something really good just happened.

409
00:18:40,170 --> 00:18:41,470
Huh?

410
00:18:41,840 --> 00:18:43,740
Like something great happened.

411
00:18:47,740 --> 00:18:49,710
Come on, come on

412
00:18:50,450 --> 00:18:51,450
Do something!

413
00:18:51,510 --> 00:18:52,880
I can't do this anymore

414
00:18:57,020 --> 00:18:58,490
He was smiling!

415
00:18:58,550 --> 00:19:00,390
What's with that?

416
00:19:00,460 --> 00:19:01,520
The whole time!

417
00:19:01,690 --> 00:19:05,590
I just looked at
Nadal's face

418
00:19:06,630 --> 00:19:09,260
He looked so...
it was such a serious face.

419
00:19:10,370 --> 00:19:13,000
I was doing my best you see

420
00:19:15,300 --> 00:19:17,240
This is your first one
Ina-chan

421
00:19:17,310 --> 00:19:19,070
Here we go

422
00:19:20,010 --> 00:19:21,310
He didn't have one?!

423
00:19:21,840 --> 00:19:23,710
I feel like
it was working though

424
00:19:23,780 --> 00:19:25,380
I've been really struggling

425
00:19:25,480 --> 00:19:28,080
I wasn't trying to piss you off, though.

426
00:19:28,580 --> 00:19:30,080
What's with that?

427
00:19:31,790 --> 00:19:33,120
He's kinda scary!

428
00:19:33,190 --> 00:19:36,460
You wouldn't be doing the Uno crap
if you weren't, man!

429
00:19:36,520 --> 00:19:39,260
I think there's comedy
in Uno fortune telling, though.

430
00:19:39,330 --> 00:19:41,800
I think it's just
a solid idea

431
00:19:42,230 --> 00:19:43,400
What're you doing?

432
00:19:43,460 --> 00:19:45,400
I was just about to
get changed when

433
00:19:45,470 --> 00:19:48,370
Are you in disguise like a detective?

434
00:19:50,070 --> 00:19:51,940
He was about to and then

435
00:20:05,150 --> 00:20:06,250
The sushi's here

436
00:20:06,890 --> 00:20:08,120
Sorry for the wait

437
00:20:09,220 --> 00:20:10,630
Sorry for the wait

438
00:20:10,790 --> 00:20:11,990
Excuse me

439
00:20:13,390 --> 00:20:14,800
Thank you so much!

440
00:20:16,100 --> 00:20:17,230
Right here

441
00:20:21,540 --> 00:20:22,800
Read it out loud

442
00:20:22,870 --> 00:20:24,170
Read it?

443
00:20:26,110 --> 00:20:29,240
Someone I'd die to fuck: Zawa-chin (EN: 8)

444
00:20:30,310 --> 00:20:32,050
Don't make the sushi guy
say that, man

445
00:20:32,110 --> 00:20:33,510
Thank you very much

446
00:20:33,610 --> 00:20:34,920
Looks great

447
00:20:35,150 --> 00:20:38,350
Akiyama has also been
struggling, huh?

448
00:20:38,920 --> 00:20:41,320
Kubota, sushi rail

449
00:20:44,460 --> 00:20:45,590
Sushi rail

450
00:20:46,660 --> 00:20:49,760
It's really like
on the level of a little kid.

451
00:20:52,800 --> 00:20:54,300
Huh? What's that?

452
00:20:55,200 --> 00:20:56,100
Huh?

453
00:20:56,640 --> 00:20:57,810
Wh-What?

454
00:20:58,440 --> 00:20:59,710
What happened?

455
00:21:00,880 --> 00:21:03,680
Isn't that what Matsuo used to wear
in his Underground years?

456
00:21:04,080 --> 00:21:05,080
The reggae dance?

457
00:21:05,150 --> 00:21:10,650
I'd like you guys to taste
some cocktail I'm going to prepare.

458
00:21:11,420 --> 00:21:13,990
That's what you're doing?
That's it?

459
00:21:14,320 --> 00:21:15,620
Yeah, that's it.

460
00:21:15,920 --> 00:21:17,490
He wore that for the reggae club?

461
00:21:17,560 --> 00:21:19,330
Those are reggae colors?

462
00:21:21,960 --> 00:21:23,500
I'm kinda used to it.

463
00:21:23,560 --> 00:21:24,830
Like bam bam!

464
00:21:25,230 --> 00:21:26,600
What are you gonna do, Matsuo-san?

465
00:21:26,670 --> 00:21:27,800
Can you clap?

466
00:21:29,400 --> 00:21:31,640
-How?
-Just like

467
00:21:44,350 --> 00:21:45,290
Huh?

468
00:21:46,420 --> 00:21:47,890
He's doing it there?

469
00:21:48,760 --> 00:21:50,260
It's spilling!

470
00:21:50,320 --> 00:21:51,430
He's mixing it there?

471
00:21:51,530 --> 00:21:53,760
That's dirty.
He's soaking wet.

472
00:21:54,730 --> 00:21:56,230
We have to drink that?

473
00:21:56,830 --> 00:21:58,730
The lid is open

474
00:22:00,670 --> 00:22:01,900
It's carbonated.

475
00:22:01,970 --> 00:22:03,600
Ah!

476
00:22:12,610 --> 00:22:13,920
Who's drinking it?

477
00:22:16,550 --> 00:22:17,890
Koumoto-san

478
00:22:36,070 --> 00:22:37,440
It's good

479
00:22:37,710 --> 00:22:41,710
Yeah man!
Bam bam bam bam!

480
00:22:44,050 --> 00:22:45,210
Yeah man!

481
00:22:45,350 --> 00:22:46,610
So ridiculous...

482
00:22:50,380 --> 00:22:51,550
There's still some left!

483
00:22:56,660 --> 00:22:57,690
Nadal.

484
00:22:59,030 --> 00:23:00,700
Is it okay, youngsters?

485
00:23:00,960 --> 00:23:02,460
Go ahead.

486
00:23:06,530 --> 00:23:08,070
Isn't it carbonated?

487
00:23:11,840 --> 00:23:13,810
Here I go. Excuse me.

488
00:23:14,410 --> 00:23:17,380
Kubota and Soshina.

489
00:23:23,520 --> 00:23:25,150
I see, yeah...

490
00:23:25,790 --> 00:23:28,290
It feels like diluted
carbonated orange juice.

491
00:23:30,730 --> 00:23:31,830
Huh?

492
00:23:31,890 --> 00:23:33,560
Yeah man!

493
00:23:34,730 --> 00:23:37,730
That's a good voice.
What's your name?

494
00:23:38,600 --> 00:23:40,970
I'm Bob Mario

495
00:23:41,600 --> 00:23:42,870
Bob Mario...

496
00:23:43,000 --> 00:23:44,640
You've heard of him?

497
00:23:44,770 --> 00:23:45,940
Yeah

498
00:23:47,640 --> 00:23:48,840
Um...

499
00:23:50,610 --> 00:23:53,250
He builds something to do with houses...
or something, right? (EN: 9)

500
00:23:53,310 --> 00:23:54,450
What are you on about?

501
00:23:55,720 --> 00:23:58,390
He works in-
he builds household things?

502
00:23:58,550 --> 00:23:59,590
Like furniture?

503
00:23:59,720 --> 00:24:01,790
The man sure liked
his incense.

504
00:24:01,890 --> 00:24:02,890
The one that smells.

505
00:24:03,260 --> 00:24:04,530
Incense?

506
00:24:04,890 --> 00:24:06,490
You know incense?

507
00:24:06,960 --> 00:24:09,030
-You don't even know it!
-I do!

508
00:24:09,330 --> 00:24:10,330
What is it?

509
00:24:10,400 --> 00:24:12,200
When your stomach goes

510
00:24:12,270 --> 00:24:13,500
What's with you?

511
00:24:13,830 --> 00:24:15,400
You're not funny.

512
00:24:20,540 --> 00:24:21,810
I know incense.

513
00:24:21,880 --> 00:24:23,740
Kubota is serious man!

514
00:24:23,840 --> 00:24:24,180
Bob-san

515
00:24:24,180 --> 00:24:25,080
Bob-san...

516
00:24:25,510 --> 00:24:26,710
Delivery!

517
00:24:26,780 --> 00:24:28,120
Huh? The delivery!

518
00:24:28,520 --> 00:24:31,650
Hello there!
I came with a delivery!

519
00:24:31,720 --> 00:24:32,750
He's the guy!

520
00:24:32,820 --> 00:24:35,220
Hello there!
I'm from Yoroku Soba!

521
00:24:35,520 --> 00:24:38,630
Here's the egg soba combo
you ordered.

522
00:24:38,860 --> 00:24:41,230
-Soba?
-Wh-Who are you?

523
00:24:41,300 --> 00:24:43,930
Excuse me! I work for Yoroku Soba

524
00:24:44,000 --> 00:24:45,430
What's with your sunglasses?

525
00:24:47,840 --> 00:24:49,640
BKB! Yay!

526
00:24:49,840 --> 00:24:50,970
It kinda hurts.

527
00:24:51,340 --> 00:24:52,640
It kinda hurts.

528
00:24:54,480 --> 00:24:55,940
Are you Gosuke?!

529
00:24:56,840 --> 00:24:57,850
That's right! Excuse me!

530
00:24:57,910 --> 00:24:59,550
He's Gosuke from the
Nadal army!

531
00:24:59,680 --> 00:25:01,420
My name is Gosuke,
excuse me.

532
00:25:01,480 --> 00:25:03,150
Present yourself.

533
00:25:03,990 --> 00:25:06,590
People call me Gosuke rap.

534
00:25:06,650 --> 00:25:09,520
I'm Gosuke Gosuke Gosuke!

535
00:25:09,590 --> 00:25:10,990
I wanna be popular with girls!

536
00:25:11,060 --> 00:25:13,890
I extend my hand
to girls in trouble

537
00:25:13,960 --> 00:25:15,660
That's the kind of man Gosuke is sank!

538
00:25:15,730 --> 00:25:17,200
Hello, my name is Gosuke
nice to meet you.

539
00:25:17,260 --> 00:25:19,130
-What's your last name?
-Takasawa.

540
00:25:19,900 --> 00:25:21,170
It's not Gosuke?

541
00:25:21,670 --> 00:25:23,440
Ah, sorry. You mind
if I wear my glasses?

542
00:25:23,500 --> 00:25:24,640
Rap it.

543
00:25:24,710 --> 00:25:25,910
Rap it?

544
00:25:25,970 --> 00:25:28,810
I'm Gosuke Gosuke Gosuke

545
00:25:28,880 --> 00:25:30,380
May I wear my glasses?

546
00:25:30,440 --> 00:25:33,280
I get stronger if my eyesight's better.
Way better.

547
00:25:33,350 --> 00:25:35,280
That's the kind of man Gosuke is sank!

548
00:25:35,450 --> 00:25:36,550
What's he saying?

549
00:25:36,720 --> 00:25:38,050
What's that at the end?

550
00:25:38,120 --> 00:25:40,590
That's the kind of man Gosuke is thank you

551
00:25:40,660 --> 00:25:43,060
Gosuke is thank you...

552
00:25:43,120 --> 00:25:44,290
That's right.

553
00:25:44,360 --> 00:25:45,430
It doesn't rhyme.

554
00:25:45,560 --> 00:25:47,500
Ah, excuse me.
You see...

555
00:25:47,560 --> 00:25:49,900
Gosuke rap's strength
is not rhyming.

556
00:25:50,730 --> 00:25:52,570
Nadal, just what...

557
00:25:52,630 --> 00:25:54,600
He can rap,

558
00:25:54,670 --> 00:25:56,040
He can't though.

559
00:25:56,140 --> 00:25:57,840
And he also has
other strengths.

560
00:25:57,910 --> 00:25:58,870
That's right, yes.

561
00:25:58,940 --> 00:25:59,910
Isn't he strong at rapping?

562
00:25:59,970 --> 00:26:02,240
-That's just for the introduction.
That's right.

563
00:26:02,310 --> 00:26:03,940
So he's Nadal's helper?

564
00:26:04,010 --> 00:26:05,110
That's right, yes.

565
00:26:05,510 --> 00:26:06,510
Something's here!

566
00:26:07,380 --> 00:26:08,880
That's right, we have a gag.

567
00:26:09,680 --> 00:26:11,020
For his presentation.

568
00:26:11,090 --> 00:26:12,720
You okay? Isn't it heavy?

569
00:26:12,790 --> 00:26:14,060
Ah! Let me get it down
excuse me.

570
00:26:14,120 --> 00:26:15,720
What's in there?

571
00:26:15,920 --> 00:26:17,490
It's just...
today, you see...

572
00:26:18,430 --> 00:26:19,560
Can you rap it?

573
00:26:19,930 --> 00:26:23,260
I'm Gosuke Gosuke Gosuke
I'm gonna tell you what's inside.

574
00:26:23,330 --> 00:26:26,070
First we have, um... uh...

575
00:26:26,130 --> 00:26:28,000
First we have
this right here...

576
00:26:28,070 --> 00:26:29,070
I'm Gosuke Gosuke

577
00:26:29,140 --> 00:26:30,600
Gosuke has his computer.

578
00:26:30,670 --> 00:26:34,080
And also this cellphone

579
00:26:34,240 --> 00:26:35,410
Watch out!

580
00:26:35,480 --> 00:26:38,110
Ah, right! This, look at-

581
00:26:38,180 --> 00:26:39,180
I'm Gosuke Gosuke

582
00:26:39,250 --> 00:26:42,420
I'm Gosuke Gosuke Gosuke,
my lightbulb broke.

583
00:26:42,480 --> 00:26:46,350
It broke, so I'll have to buy one
on my way back home.

584
00:26:46,420 --> 00:26:47,790
That's the kind of man Gosuke is, thank you!

585
00:26:47,860 --> 00:26:49,090
Wonderful!

586
00:26:49,260 --> 00:26:50,390
It's not wonderful, though.

587
00:26:50,460 --> 00:26:52,960
Nadal? What even is this?

588
00:26:53,160 --> 00:26:55,230
-Gosuke-san...
-Thank you very much!

589
00:26:55,300 --> 00:26:57,230
So that's the real deal.

590
00:26:57,300 --> 00:27:00,670
One, two, three, four!

591
00:27:00,740 --> 00:27:04,870
Wishing for stuff we don't have!
I'm Gosuke

592
00:27:04,940 --> 00:27:08,740
Gosuke dropped out of his graduate program

593
00:27:08,810 --> 00:27:10,810
I failed a hundred interviews and now I'm here!

594
00:27:10,880 --> 00:27:12,850
Please take me already!

595
00:27:12,910 --> 00:27:16,950
Wishing for stuff we don't have!
I'm working at a sushi shop

596
00:27:17,020 --> 00:27:20,490
but I'm also selling soba,
but we don't get any calls.

597
00:27:20,820 --> 00:27:22,890
Why aren't the sound waves reaching us?!

598
00:27:22,960 --> 00:27:24,790
Give me sound waves!

599
00:27:24,860 --> 00:27:27,860
Wishing for stuff we don't have!
Since we don't have waves

600
00:27:27,930 --> 00:27:32,600
I think it's bad, it's bad
that we don't have any waves

601
00:27:32,900 --> 00:27:34,840
but maybe it's my ears that are weird!

602
00:27:34,900 --> 00:27:36,800
Give me more ears!

603
00:27:36,870 --> 00:27:39,910
Wishing for stuff we don't have!
There's a lot

604
00:27:39,970 --> 00:27:42,210
and so now I'm doing this,
but like

605
00:27:42,280 --> 00:27:45,110
it keeps going round and round

606
00:27:45,180 --> 00:27:47,050
and so I wonder what's wrong with me

607
00:27:47,110 --> 00:27:49,250
I don't get it!

608
00:27:49,320 --> 00:27:51,090
Wishing for stuff we don't have!

609
00:27:51,350 --> 00:27:53,350
Wait, wait a second.

610
00:27:53,520 --> 00:27:54,520
Okay

611
00:27:54,590 --> 00:27:56,290
It feels like this is Nadal's fault.

612
00:27:56,860 --> 00:28:00,960
I'm sorry, but...
I haven't heard almost anything.

613
00:28:01,930 --> 00:28:04,730
He's talking about stuff we don't have.

614
00:28:04,800 --> 00:28:06,230
He also said something about waves?

615
00:28:06,300 --> 00:28:08,700
Yes, that's right, that's just...

616
00:28:08,770 --> 00:28:12,640
It's a song about things you want
but don't get.

617
00:28:12,710 --> 00:28:13,770
I see.

618
00:28:13,840 --> 00:28:15,410
It's a little kid gag, kind of

619
00:28:15,480 --> 00:28:16,440
I'm not asking you.

620
00:28:16,510 --> 00:28:18,310
Yes well, let's see

621
00:28:18,380 --> 00:28:21,250
I have a fusion
with the Gosuke rap from earlier.

622
00:28:22,120 --> 00:28:23,420
I wanna see that!

623
00:28:27,250 --> 00:28:29,390
Wishing for stuff we don't have, here!

624
00:28:29,460 --> 00:28:33,230
I'm Gosuke Gosuke Gosuke
I wanna be popular with girls!

625
00:28:33,290 --> 00:28:37,230
I'll lend a hand
to any girls in trouble!

626
00:28:37,300 --> 00:28:40,330
That's the kind of man that Gosuke is!

627
00:28:40,400 --> 00:28:41,340
This is the Gosuke rap!

628
00:28:41,400 --> 00:28:43,270
Wishing for stuff we don't have, here!

629
00:28:43,340 --> 00:28:47,370
I'm Gosuke Gosuke Gosuke,
I dropped out of my graduate program

630
00:28:47,440 --> 00:28:51,280
I studied hard for maths,
but ended up getting it all wrong

631
00:28:51,350 --> 00:28:53,910
That's the kind of man Gosuke is!

632
00:28:54,110 --> 00:28:57,220
I stayed in bed for five whole days
Wishing for stuff we don't have!

633
00:28:57,280 --> 00:29:01,360
Taking it all into account
that's how I got here

634
00:29:01,420 --> 00:29:03,160
Here we go!

635
00:29:03,220 --> 00:29:05,190
Wishing for stuff we don't have!

636
00:29:05,260 --> 00:29:07,230
That's the kind of man Gosuke is!

637
00:29:07,330 --> 00:29:09,260
Thank you very much

638
00:29:09,330 --> 00:29:10,800
Wishing for stuff we don't have

639
00:29:10,870 --> 00:29:12,300
Koumoto-san, what're you doing?

640
00:29:13,400 --> 00:29:15,040
So what changed?

641
00:29:15,500 --> 00:29:19,240
Um...
The rhythm, a little

642
00:29:19,340 --> 00:29:21,310
And you were talking freely?

643
00:29:21,380 --> 00:29:23,110
Like, did the lyrics
get more free?

644
00:29:23,180 --> 00:29:25,510
Yeah... freedom.

645
00:29:26,810 --> 00:29:29,050
Can you rap about Nadal?

646
00:29:29,120 --> 00:29:29,980
Same concept, "wishing for stuff you don't have".

647
00:29:30,050 --> 00:29:31,290
Yes! Excuse me.

648
00:29:31,350 --> 00:29:33,990
Can you wish for something
Nadal doesn't have?

649
00:29:34,150 --> 00:29:35,960
-Can you do that?
-Of course, yes!

650
00:29:36,460 --> 00:29:37,660
That's great.

651
00:29:38,590 --> 00:29:42,460
Wishing for stuff we don't have, now!

652
00:29:42,530 --> 00:29:46,370
You are Nadal, Nadal!
You're a great guy!

653
00:29:46,430 --> 00:29:48,500
You always say awful things

654
00:29:48,570 --> 00:29:52,610
But deep inside, you're a good guy
that's the kind of man Nadal is!

655
00:29:52,670 --> 00:29:54,580
Everyone watch this!

656
00:29:54,640 --> 00:29:56,480
Wishing for stuff we don't have!

657
00:29:57,210 --> 00:29:58,450
You just licked his ass

658
00:29:58,510 --> 00:30:01,250
It was pretty good.
He has like another 50.

659
00:30:01,950 --> 00:30:02,980
Can you say the same?

660
00:30:03,050 --> 00:30:04,620
About myself?
Yeah, of course.

661
00:30:04,790 --> 00:30:06,050
Can you rap it, Nadal?

662
00:30:06,120 --> 00:30:07,150
Do it!

663
00:30:07,250 --> 00:30:08,560
I'm counting on you! Let's go!

664
00:30:10,260 --> 00:30:12,030
One, two, three, four!

665
00:30:12,090 --> 00:30:14,190
Ah, right, right!

666
00:30:14,260 --> 00:30:15,900
Wishing for stuff we don't have!

667
00:30:16,000 --> 00:30:19,970
Everyone plays dumb
acts smart

668
00:30:20,030 --> 00:30:24,270
That's what's great about comedy
and I'm like that too!

669
00:30:24,340 --> 00:30:26,310
Wait, that's not right!

670
00:30:26,370 --> 00:30:27,910
Wishing for stuff we don't have

671
00:30:27,980 --> 00:30:29,910
We have to work hard!

672
00:30:29,980 --> 00:30:30,980
Thank you very much.

673
00:30:31,110 --> 00:30:33,780
That was kinda bad.
Pretty rough.

674
00:30:34,210 --> 00:30:37,150
Go to a school festival with just that
and you'd get murdered by the planning committee!

675
00:30:37,320 --> 00:30:39,520
Do a school festival number.
Can you do it?

676
00:30:39,820 --> 00:30:40,850
A school festival?

677
00:30:40,920 --> 00:30:42,790
I'll be the straight man,
so you start.

678
00:30:44,220 --> 00:30:45,590
Alright, here we go

679
00:30:45,660 --> 00:30:49,460
Wishing for stuff we don't have

680
00:30:49,700 --> 00:30:53,270
I'm Gosuke Gosuke Gosuke
school festivals sure are fun

681
00:30:53,330 --> 00:30:57,270
There are many students
and a lot of shops too!

682
00:30:57,340 --> 00:30:59,810
That's the kind of man that Gosuke is, thank you!

683
00:31:00,670 --> 00:31:01,680
This isn't about you!

684
00:31:01,740 --> 00:31:03,310
Wishing for stuff we don't have!

685
00:31:03,380 --> 00:31:04,750
This is awful.

686
00:31:05,750 --> 00:31:07,550
That's an awful retort

687
00:31:08,250 --> 00:31:11,250
Isn't that
what comedy is all about?

688
00:31:11,450 --> 00:31:12,890
Like in Matsumoto-san's style.

689
00:31:15,990 --> 00:31:17,860
And people get laughs
like that.

690
00:31:17,930 --> 00:31:18,830
Really?

691
00:31:18,890 --> 00:31:20,230
Back in Deluxe's time, yeah.

692
00:31:20,530 --> 00:31:22,700
No way, not at all.

693
00:31:22,760 --> 00:31:25,130
Let's go more mainstream.
Ah, right!

694
00:31:25,200 --> 00:31:26,200
It's still going?

695
00:31:26,670 --> 00:31:30,700
Please, if there's something
you'd like to request, go ahead.

696
00:31:30,800 --> 00:31:32,240
Ah, uh...

697
00:31:32,370 --> 00:31:33,410
Then

698
00:31:34,580 --> 00:31:35,680
Do Chikubo

699
00:31:35,740 --> 00:31:38,180
Chikuwa! Right!
Let's go with Chikuwa! (EN: 10)

700
00:31:38,410 --> 00:31:41,420
Chikuwa?

701
00:31:42,680 --> 00:31:43,680
Here we go

702
00:31:45,290 --> 00:31:46,420
Huh?

703
00:31:46,750 --> 00:31:47,860
Huh?!

704
00:31:49,260 --> 00:31:50,260
Wha-?

705
00:31:52,360 --> 00:31:53,560
What happened?

706
00:31:53,630 --> 00:31:54,600
Chikuwa!

707
00:31:54,700 --> 00:31:56,700
He didn't say chikuwa at all!

708
00:31:56,800 --> 00:31:57,900
He said Chikubo!

709
00:31:58,130 --> 00:31:59,200
Chikubo!

710
00:32:01,740 --> 00:32:03,870
He definitely said chikubo!

711
00:32:04,040 --> 00:32:05,210
I said chikubo

712
00:32:05,940 --> 00:32:07,940
You thought it was chikuwa
but I said chikubo

713
00:32:08,080 --> 00:32:10,040
No way!

714
00:32:10,540 --> 00:32:11,850
I've never heard of "chikubo"!

715
00:32:11,910 --> 00:32:13,880
Didn't you wanna say something else?

716
00:32:13,950 --> 00:32:15,450
Like "Kubota"! or something?

717
00:32:15,520 --> 00:32:16,720
Me?

718
00:32:16,820 --> 00:32:18,220
No, Akiyama-san

719
00:32:19,190 --> 00:32:21,460
Akiyama laughed out loudly!

720
00:32:21,760 --> 00:32:23,220
And Kubota too

721
00:32:23,360 --> 00:32:25,990
I just saw Akiyama-san

722
00:32:26,060 --> 00:32:28,230
Okay, let's look at Akiyama first

723
00:32:28,300 --> 00:32:30,200
What was your helper called?

724
00:32:30,260 --> 00:32:32,670
I'm Gosuke!
Sorry for my manners.

725
00:32:33,230 --> 00:32:35,170
He kept going for hours, huh?

726
00:32:35,740 --> 00:32:37,810
How experienced.

727
00:32:37,870 --> 00:32:39,110
It was too long!

728
00:32:39,170 --> 00:32:41,710
I'm Gosuke Gosuke!

729
00:32:42,980 --> 00:32:45,710
Please, if there's something
you'd like to request, go ahead.

730
00:32:47,380 --> 00:32:48,380
Chikubo!

731
00:32:48,450 --> 00:32:51,190
Chikuwa! Right!
Let's go with Chikuwa!

732
00:32:51,320 --> 00:32:55,390
Chikuwa?

733
00:32:55,490 --> 00:32:56,560
Here we go

734
00:32:59,260 --> 00:33:02,460
No, I think he definitely did.

735
00:33:02,900 --> 00:33:05,570
Even Akiyama
has accepted it

736
00:33:05,630 --> 00:33:06,730
What card is it?

737
00:33:06,800 --> 00:33:08,140
I already have one

738
00:33:08,200 --> 00:33:10,500
Okay, so
orange then

739
00:33:12,110 --> 00:33:13,340
And Kubota too!

740
00:33:13,410 --> 00:33:14,370
Why?

741
00:33:14,440 --> 00:33:15,680
You laughed!

742
00:33:15,740 --> 00:33:16,940
I was just reacting!
Shut up!

743
00:33:17,010 --> 00:33:18,810
He laughed!

744
00:33:18,880 --> 00:33:20,210
But Akiyama did too...

745
00:33:20,780 --> 00:33:22,680
What are you doing?!

746
00:33:24,450 --> 00:33:26,650
Akiyama kinda invited him

747
00:33:26,720 --> 00:33:28,760
But Kubota also stood out!

748
00:33:28,820 --> 00:33:30,460
I didn't!

749
00:33:30,520 --> 00:33:32,660
I don't even know what
he means by that.

750
00:33:32,730 --> 00:33:34,230
Stop it, man!

751
00:33:36,460 --> 00:33:39,370
Okay, I think this is the part

752
00:33:39,970 --> 00:33:43,940
where Amazon said we became
too vulgar

753
00:33:44,070 --> 00:33:45,910
They even said my name, right?

754
00:33:45,970 --> 00:33:47,910
Okay, take a close look then.

755
00:33:47,980 --> 00:33:49,880
We're pretty far into the show

756
00:33:58,190 --> 00:34:00,890
Jimmy-san, you can't be so
hostile with Gosuke

757
00:34:00,950 --> 00:34:02,520
I mean, he had to look
at this stupid face.

758
00:34:02,590 --> 00:34:04,060
Gosuke did.

759
00:34:04,830 --> 00:34:06,760
He had to be kind after all

760
00:34:06,830 --> 00:34:08,800
You were so cold
despite being older than him.

761
00:34:08,860 --> 00:34:09,960
You talk way too much.

762
00:34:10,030 --> 00:34:11,230
Sorry

763
00:34:11,300 --> 00:34:14,070
Well, it's just that
I don't know much about rap.

764
00:34:15,470 --> 00:34:17,170
You've smoked it all, man.

765
00:34:17,240 --> 00:34:18,840
I can keep going

766
00:34:19,410 --> 00:34:20,410
You're far too lax about that

767
00:34:20,470 --> 00:34:22,080
I do it till I feel numb

768
00:34:24,080 --> 00:34:25,650
My tongue gets numb if I keep going.

769
00:34:27,780 --> 00:34:29,380
That's dangerous man

770
00:34:30,020 --> 00:34:31,790
Are you sure about that?

771
00:34:32,890 --> 00:34:37,460
You've all been
playing with girls a little too much, huh?

772
00:34:37,520 --> 00:34:38,430
Yeah

773
00:34:38,490 --> 00:34:41,300
You use your hips?

774
00:34:41,360 --> 00:34:42,460
Hips?

775
00:34:42,530 --> 00:34:43,800
You shaking 'em?

776
00:34:43,860 --> 00:34:45,170
Well, more than before.

777
00:34:45,230 --> 00:34:47,670
I want you to realize
just how you move your hips.

778
00:34:48,170 --> 00:34:51,670
I'll act as a stand in,
so practice your moves on me.

779
00:34:52,140 --> 00:34:55,440
Whoever can do it the fastest.

780
00:34:56,410 --> 00:34:57,580
I want to find someone like that.

781
00:34:57,640 --> 00:34:58,680
What?

782
00:34:59,210 --> 00:35:00,050
Like the manliest guy?

783
00:35:00,110 --> 00:35:01,110
Yeah, yeah, manliest!

784
00:35:01,180 --> 00:35:02,650
We'll challenge you then.

785
00:35:02,980 --> 00:35:04,280
Who's gonna start?

786
00:35:04,450 --> 00:35:06,520
You choose, Kubota

787
00:35:06,590 --> 00:35:08,690
Someone strong-looking...

788
00:35:09,360 --> 00:35:11,460
Alright,
let's go Akiyama-san.

789
00:35:11,530 --> 00:35:12,560
Yeah.

790
00:35:12,930 --> 00:35:14,760
Are we gonna go full?

791
00:35:14,960 --> 00:35:16,730
-Full?
-Full cock.

792
00:35:17,160 --> 00:35:18,370
What do you mean?

793
00:35:18,630 --> 00:35:20,770
I just wanna count.

794
00:35:20,830 --> 00:35:22,670
That's the best way to do it.

795
00:35:23,300 --> 00:35:24,740
Okay, give me a second.

796
00:35:24,870 --> 00:35:26,240
I'm feeling sick.

797
00:35:26,310 --> 00:35:27,310
He's really balding!

798
00:35:27,370 --> 00:35:29,380
I didn't wanna see that.

799
00:35:30,110 --> 00:35:31,650
So Nadal should stand here?

800
00:35:31,710 --> 00:35:32,910
I have to take it out?

801
00:35:32,980 --> 00:35:34,110
Do it

802
00:35:34,310 --> 00:35:36,320
Nadal has to take it out

803
00:35:38,950 --> 00:35:40,050
Take out the red balls

804
00:35:40,120 --> 00:35:41,660
This is the worst

805
00:35:43,690 --> 00:35:44,960
Okay, let's go, one by one.

806
00:35:45,030 --> 00:35:47,330
I'll make sure to let you know
when it's good

807
00:35:47,390 --> 00:35:48,500
Let us know?

808
00:35:48,560 --> 00:35:50,100
With a sound

809
00:35:50,560 --> 00:35:51,900
That's tiny!

810
00:35:54,330 --> 00:35:55,740
You said that?

811
00:35:55,840 --> 00:35:56,900
Stop that!

812
00:35:57,640 --> 00:36:00,040
All ready?
Ready?

813
00:36:00,340 --> 00:36:01,780
Alright! Start!

814
00:36:01,920 --> 00:36:04,650
"Vulgar images not shown on screen"

815
00:36:04,650 --> 00:36:07,510
No way, no way. Come on
"Vulgar images not shown on screen"

816
00:36:07,510 --> 00:36:07,540
"Vulgar images not shown on screen"

817
00:36:07,850 --> 00:36:08,950
No man...

818
00:36:09,020 --> 00:36:11,390
Stop!
Alright, 19 times!

819
00:36:12,220 --> 00:36:14,790
19 times!
Not bad!

820
00:36:16,320 --> 00:36:18,130
Not even 15 seconds.

821
00:36:18,190 --> 00:36:19,290
Who's next?

822
00:36:19,760 --> 00:36:20,790
Koba-san.

823
00:36:23,230 --> 00:36:24,230
Tiny!

824
00:36:25,000 --> 00:36:27,130
Stop it with that!

825
00:36:27,200 --> 00:36:29,040
We could turn it back later.

826
00:36:30,140 --> 00:36:31,140
Alright.

827
00:36:32,270 --> 00:36:33,510
Start!

828
00:36:34,340 --> 00:36:35,310
He's fast!

829
00:36:35,380 --> 00:36:36,510
He's quick!

830
00:36:46,390 --> 00:36:47,550
33 times.

831
00:36:48,190 --> 00:36:49,990
This beats the previous record.

832
00:36:50,060 --> 00:36:51,460
Koba-san beat it?

833
00:36:51,730 --> 00:36:54,490
It was Koyabu-san
with 25 times.

834
00:36:54,560 --> 00:36:55,560
You've practiced?

835
00:36:55,630 --> 00:36:58,500
I just won't lose against
a vegetarian!

836
00:37:00,900 --> 00:37:02,100
Anything more?

837
00:37:02,170 --> 00:37:03,740
Ask the senpais to come over.

838
00:37:04,270 --> 00:37:05,040
Ask us to come over.

839
00:37:05,110 --> 00:37:06,340
Why?

840
00:37:06,940 --> 00:37:07,870
Ask the senpais to come over.

841
00:37:07,940 --> 00:37:09,640
Isn't this rough for me already?

842
00:37:09,710 --> 00:37:11,040
So you're not doing it?

843
00:37:11,480 --> 00:37:13,150
So I should go there?

844
00:37:15,520 --> 00:37:16,950
You probably should.

845
00:37:17,150 --> 00:37:18,420
Ready?
Yeah!

846
00:37:19,150 --> 00:37:20,990
Set, go!

847
00:37:22,660 --> 00:37:23,690
Start!

848
00:37:30,000 --> 00:37:30,760
Wait!

849
00:37:30,830 --> 00:37:33,830
He went all the way!
All the way!

850
00:37:33,900 --> 00:37:35,500
More than anyone else!

851
00:37:36,840 --> 00:37:38,310
That's what Kubota-san is saying, yeah.

852
00:37:38,370 --> 00:37:41,680
But it's also the same
as everybody else.

853
00:37:49,420 --> 00:37:50,350
I'm feeling sick

854
00:37:50,420 --> 00:37:51,950
This is the worst

855
00:37:52,120 --> 00:37:53,590
It sucked!

856
00:37:54,960 --> 00:37:56,190
You're the worst, man!

857
00:37:56,260 --> 00:37:58,430
I take that as a compliment!

858
00:38:03,130 --> 00:38:06,370
Everybody managed to hold on!

859
00:38:06,500 --> 00:38:08,670
So Matsuo

860
00:38:08,740 --> 00:38:10,040
It's his first time

861
00:38:10,100 --> 00:38:11,870
-First time, yeah.
-Huh?! Your first one?!

862
00:38:11,940 --> 00:38:12,840
No way!

863
00:38:12,910 --> 00:38:14,880
He's held on for a long time!

864
00:38:14,940 --> 00:38:17,580
Wait wait wait.
What is it, Kubota?

865
00:38:17,780 --> 00:38:20,580
To be honest I'm feeling
kind of sick at myself.

866
00:38:22,120 --> 00:38:23,450
You did this!

867
00:38:23,520 --> 00:38:25,920
It was far worse for us!

868
00:38:25,990 --> 00:38:29,160
It almost feels like Matsuo
should get more than a yellow!

869
00:38:29,220 --> 00:38:31,790
But, but, well...

870
00:38:32,160 --> 00:38:33,160
Yellow

871
00:38:33,830 --> 00:38:34,830
Come on

872
00:38:34,900 --> 00:38:36,660
Alright, that's it.

873
00:38:37,500 --> 00:38:41,170
Give me a break!

874
00:38:41,230 --> 00:38:43,070
I'm feeling kinda bad as well

875
00:38:43,140 --> 00:38:44,100
Sorry

876
00:38:49,210 --> 00:38:50,310
Here we go!

877
00:38:53,610 --> 00:38:56,650
Let's do it one more time.
It looked good

878
00:38:56,880 --> 00:38:58,950
We can switch

879
00:39:00,220 --> 00:39:01,220
No way

880
00:39:01,290 --> 00:39:02,760
No one will.

881
00:39:03,090 --> 00:39:05,290
This is pretty rough.

882
00:39:07,630 --> 00:39:08,630
What's your problem?!

883
00:39:08,700 --> 00:39:10,100
I don't understand either!

884
00:39:10,860 --> 00:39:13,200
How did it come to this?

885
00:39:13,300 --> 00:39:15,100
-It's serious!
-What the hell?!

886
00:39:15,170 --> 00:39:16,670
I knew he'd say that.

887
00:39:17,240 --> 00:39:18,470
Don't touch me

888
00:39:18,610 --> 00:39:20,240
Here we go!
Ready to start?

889
00:39:20,310 --> 00:39:21,810
Akiyama-san, say the word

890
00:39:21,880 --> 00:39:23,710
Alright. Come here!

891
00:39:23,780 --> 00:39:25,410
Ready? Go!

892
00:39:25,480 --> 00:39:26,750
Alright!

893
00:39:29,420 --> 00:39:30,720
This is awful

894
00:39:31,050 --> 00:39:34,320
That was pathetic! 16 time-
Huh, What's that?!

895
00:39:38,090 --> 00:39:39,790
That was Nadal, right?!

896
00:39:45,170 --> 00:39:47,030
Jimmy-san pisses me off.

897
00:39:47,530 --> 00:39:49,140
Jimmy-san pissed me off.

898
00:39:49,240 --> 00:39:50,500
But you just-!

899
00:39:51,400 --> 00:39:53,570
What was that all of a sudden?

900
00:39:53,840 --> 00:39:57,410
I knew you'd attack me!

901
00:39:57,480 --> 00:39:58,580
What was that?

902
00:39:58,650 --> 00:40:00,450
Why did you have to talk like that
Jimmy-san?

903
00:40:01,480 --> 00:40:03,180
"Jimmy-san pisses me off!"

904
00:40:06,390 --> 00:40:07,990
It was Nadal?!

905
00:40:08,050 --> 00:40:09,720
No, I was gonna hold on, but...

906
00:40:09,790 --> 00:40:11,420
But Jimmy-san went out and...

907
00:40:12,060 --> 00:40:13,460
It's so frustrating!

908
00:40:15,730 --> 00:40:17,260
Why did that go so wrong?!

909
00:40:18,060 --> 00:40:19,000
You're out!

910
00:40:19,070 --> 00:40:20,070
That sucks...

911
00:40:25,270 --> 00:40:28,110
I think you saved Soshina.
He looked about to laugh.

912
00:40:28,170 --> 00:40:31,140
But this guy was
really in trouble.

913
00:40:31,410 --> 00:40:33,110
So two out!

914
00:40:33,180 --> 00:40:36,380
There are still plenty left!

915
00:40:37,280 --> 00:40:38,690
I'm trying my best

916
00:40:38,850 --> 00:40:40,550
Still eight left.

917
00:40:40,890 --> 00:40:44,990
I even practiced holding my laughter.
But there was no way.

918
00:40:45,190 --> 00:40:47,460
It was way too funny.

919
00:40:47,530 --> 00:40:51,360
I think I was in trouble
during the Gosuke rap.

920
00:40:51,800 --> 00:40:54,800
I stayed in bed for five days.
Wishing for stuff we don't have!

921
00:40:54,870 --> 00:40:56,870
Taking things into consideration

922
00:40:56,940 --> 00:40:58,910
Gosuke was supposed to help me out

923
00:40:58,970 --> 00:41:00,440
But he was always
looking right at me

924
00:41:01,240 --> 00:41:03,540
It was like having an enemy

925
00:41:04,310 --> 00:41:07,050
But I guess well...

926
00:41:07,450 --> 00:41:09,680
I felt it again, that...

927
00:41:09,850 --> 00:41:11,950
That I'm just Nishino's puppet.

928
00:41:12,020 --> 00:41:13,050
It felt like that.

929
00:41:13,120 --> 00:41:15,420
None of my gags worked well

930
00:41:15,720 --> 00:41:16,960
It's serious!

931
00:41:17,020 --> 00:41:18,090
What the hell?!

932
00:41:26,600 --> 00:41:30,540
Akiyama-san went all
like this...

933
00:41:30,600 --> 00:41:32,670
It's just the hernia, you know?

934
00:41:32,740 --> 00:41:33,740
You have a hernia?

935
00:41:33,810 --> 00:41:36,540
I thought the energy
and trajectory was pretty good

936
00:41:36,610 --> 00:41:37,840
It was so stable too

937
00:41:37,910 --> 00:41:39,250
Are you going, Matsuo-san?

938
00:41:39,310 --> 00:41:40,510
Ready?

939
00:41:45,150 --> 00:41:46,420
-Okay?
-Yeah!

940
00:41:46,890 --> 00:41:49,390
Ready... Go!

941
00:41:51,060 --> 00:41:53,590
This is actually pretty good...

942
00:41:54,690 --> 00:41:56,660
What does he think he is?

943
00:41:57,160 --> 00:41:58,870
The chief?

944
00:41:59,800 --> 00:42:02,440
23 times. It's a tie.

945
00:42:03,340 --> 00:42:04,340
A tie.

946
00:42:04,400 --> 00:42:06,870
But considering his age

947
00:42:07,370 --> 00:42:08,840
Koba-san did 40...

948
00:42:08,910 --> 00:42:10,010
Seven

949
00:42:10,110 --> 00:42:11,580
I think Koba-san wins

950
00:42:11,650 --> 00:42:14,110
I always move the skin
when I put it in, though.

951
00:42:14,410 --> 00:42:17,120
So like, if you do that...

952
00:42:17,520 --> 00:42:18,650
Ah...

953
00:42:26,090 --> 00:42:27,160
A tattoo?

954
00:42:29,360 --> 00:42:30,730
-A tattoo?
-He has one

955
00:42:33,200 --> 00:42:35,900
-It's too cute.
-It's super cute!

956
00:42:36,570 --> 00:42:39,310
He has a tattoo?
Why d'you have one?

957
00:42:43,110 --> 00:42:45,480
Well, I'm just saying.

958
00:42:47,180 --> 00:42:50,480
I'm curious.
Aren't you curious?

959
00:42:53,290 --> 00:42:54,790
Isn't anyone curious?

960
00:42:54,890 --> 00:42:56,460
You should take a closer look.

961
00:42:56,620 --> 00:42:57,620
Look

962
00:42:57,690 --> 00:42:59,460
Then we can talk

963
00:43:00,390 --> 00:43:03,160
You've been keeping
your distance, huh?

964
00:43:03,230 --> 00:43:04,900
-I haven't, at all.
-You're not participating.

965
00:43:04,960 --> 00:43:06,330
I'm here, I'm here.

966
00:43:06,870 --> 00:43:08,300
When did you get that bra?

967
00:43:10,170 --> 00:43:11,810
Take a closer look

968
00:43:12,310 --> 00:43:15,380
Whoa! No way!

969
00:43:15,440 --> 00:43:16,480
Thank you

970
00:43:16,540 --> 00:43:17,640
It's talking?

971
00:43:17,880 --> 00:43:18,880
I'm feeling sick

972
00:43:18,950 --> 00:43:20,010
Hello

973
00:43:20,080 --> 00:43:21,210
Hello!

974
00:43:21,750 --> 00:43:23,120
Where did you come from?

975
00:43:23,180 --> 00:43:25,590
Me? Yokohama!

976
00:43:26,450 --> 00:43:29,590
You have to say hi.
Come say hello.

977
00:43:29,660 --> 00:43:30,720
Bro

978
00:43:31,520 --> 00:43:32,460
Hello!

979
00:43:32,530 --> 00:43:33,590
Hello!

980
00:43:34,330 --> 00:43:35,260
Hello

981
00:43:35,330 --> 00:43:36,760
It's nice to meet you!

982
00:43:36,860 --> 00:43:38,530
It's nice to meet you too!

983
00:43:38,600 --> 00:43:40,700
Hello!

984
00:43:41,030 --> 00:43:42,540
Bye!

985
00:43:42,600 --> 00:43:44,140
Hello!

986
00:43:44,870 --> 00:43:47,110
Hello!

987
00:43:47,210 --> 00:43:48,170
Um...

988
00:43:48,710 --> 00:43:50,280
Touch me...

989
00:43:51,240 --> 00:43:52,610
Caress me...

990
00:43:52,680 --> 00:43:54,210
Can I touch you?

991
00:43:57,020 --> 00:43:58,350
Yaaay!!

992
00:43:59,390 --> 00:44:03,160
Yaaay!! Yay yay!!

993
00:44:03,520 --> 00:44:04,920
He did it!

994
00:44:05,160 --> 00:44:07,860
I'm really happy right now!

995
00:44:07,930 --> 00:44:10,500
Yay yay yay!

996
00:44:10,730 --> 00:44:14,300
Thank you! Thank you so much!

997
00:44:15,440 --> 00:44:17,440
What's with his urethra?

998
00:44:18,640 --> 00:44:19,710
Looks like a pussy

999
00:44:21,040 --> 00:44:22,040
A cock...

1000
00:44:22,110 --> 00:44:23,580
You've never seen one?

1001
00:44:24,040 --> 00:44:25,810
His peehole
looks like a pussy.

1002
00:44:26,010 --> 00:44:27,810
You haven't even seen a real pussy

1003
00:44:28,410 --> 00:44:29,820
Don't get carried away

1004
00:44:29,920 --> 00:44:32,450
I'm sure you've also
only seen one online.

1005
00:44:32,520 --> 00:44:35,490
I know a good place
to do my own research.

1006
00:44:36,060 --> 00:44:38,560
Though I couldn't find
a clitoris until recently.

1007
00:44:39,190 --> 00:44:40,530
Where was it?

1008
00:44:43,130 --> 00:44:44,200
Right here.

1009
00:44:44,260 --> 00:44:45,400
Correct

1010
00:44:46,370 --> 00:44:48,200
You guys

1011
00:44:48,600 --> 00:44:50,970
You don't know about women,
don't get cocky.

1012
00:44:51,740 --> 00:44:53,070
Well... I'm sorry, but...

1013
00:44:53,140 --> 00:44:54,670
You come here first

1014
00:44:54,970 --> 00:44:57,680
Come on, right here.
Let's check if you're strong.

1015
00:44:58,380 --> 00:45:01,010
Come on,
right on my face!

1016
00:45:01,350 --> 00:45:02,380
On the face?

1017
00:45:02,450 --> 00:45:04,420
I feel like I can do it now

1018
00:45:04,480 --> 00:45:05,350
Move it this way

1019
00:45:05,420 --> 00:45:06,220
No, that's fine

1020
00:45:06,290 --> 00:45:08,350
You should move it
with your fingers

1021
00:45:13,230 --> 00:45:14,630
Are you Yanagiba Toshiro? (EN: 11)

1022
00:45:19,370 --> 00:45:20,470
On the face?

1023
00:45:20,530 --> 00:45:22,370
Yeah, that's what I said...

1024
00:45:22,640 --> 00:45:25,070
Really?

1025
00:45:25,210 --> 00:45:27,110
Can you count the thrusts?

1026
00:45:27,170 --> 00:45:28,440
I'm counting myself too

1027
00:45:28,510 --> 00:45:29,680
Okay, ready?

1028
00:45:29,740 --> 00:45:32,380
Yeah.
Okay. Start!

1029
00:45:44,460 --> 00:45:46,590
That smelled
for like a second!

1030
00:45:46,890 --> 00:45:48,960
Don't do that. That stinks!

1031
00:45:49,730 --> 00:45:53,500
If you hold it in
it kinda smells like farts.

1032
00:45:53,770 --> 00:45:54,700
Sometimes

1033
00:45:54,870 --> 00:45:56,870
-How many was that?
-33

1034
00:45:57,040 --> 00:45:59,870
He's pretty confident.
33 is tied with the champion.

1035
00:45:59,940 --> 00:46:01,210
We're all lined up.

1036
00:46:02,010 --> 00:46:04,810
I really don't think
I could do 33, though.

1037
00:46:05,210 --> 00:46:06,880
Hey, lend me your cheeks.

1038
00:46:07,380 --> 00:46:08,880
I've had enough!

1039
00:46:08,950 --> 00:46:10,120
Ina-chan, keep count.

1040
00:46:10,180 --> 00:46:11,990
Sorry, sorry. It's okay.

1041
00:46:12,050 --> 00:46:12,920
Come on...

1042
00:46:13,790 --> 00:46:15,560
Sorry, really sorry.

1043
00:46:15,690 --> 00:46:17,560
I know it's not great for you

1044
00:46:18,730 --> 00:46:21,130
Come on. Please count.
Here we go. Sorry.

1045
00:46:21,190 --> 00:46:23,200
-Who's counting?
-Ina-chan.

1046
00:46:24,000 --> 00:46:25,830
How did it get to this?

1047
00:46:26,630 --> 00:46:28,170
Ready... Go!

1048
00:46:28,230 --> 00:46:29,370
Alright!

1049
00:46:29,570 --> 00:46:30,940
The blue one!

1050
00:46:31,870 --> 00:46:32,910
It's blue!

1051
00:46:41,580 --> 00:46:43,720
This is against the rules!

1052
00:46:45,950 --> 00:46:47,090
How many times?

1053
00:46:47,490 --> 00:46:48,660
19

1054
00:46:48,960 --> 00:46:52,690
Hey, don't...
Alright, I'll kill myself then!

1055
00:46:53,190 --> 00:46:54,790
I'm gonna die!

1056
00:46:56,400 --> 00:46:58,930
I did it so much for only 19?

1057
00:47:01,270 --> 00:47:02,570
Damn it!

1058
00:47:03,240 --> 00:47:04,840
Is he that upset?

1059
00:47:07,570 --> 00:47:08,910
It's fine...

1060
00:47:09,180 --> 00:47:11,880
It's always 19!

1061
00:47:14,150 --> 00:47:16,350
I'm jealous!
You got 30, huh?!

1062
00:47:17,250 --> 00:47:19,290
Why?!

1063
00:47:19,920 --> 00:47:23,020
Why do I always
get just 19?!

1064
00:47:23,920 --> 00:47:25,260
You wanted it so badly?

1065
00:47:26,330 --> 00:47:28,900
I did, I did!
I wanted the 30!

1066
00:47:29,600 --> 00:47:33,170
That's a man's pride!
Not 19!

1067
00:47:33,230 --> 00:47:35,000
It's been three times!

1068
00:47:38,540 --> 00:47:39,610
Damn it!

1069
00:47:45,210 --> 00:47:46,280
It's not working?

1070
00:47:47,880 --> 00:47:48,920
Where's Gosuke?

1071
00:47:49,150 --> 00:47:50,420
He's not around.

1072
00:47:53,220 --> 00:47:54,450
Time over

1073
00:47:55,460 --> 00:47:56,460
It's over.

1074
00:47:57,260 --> 00:47:59,790
It's finished!

1075
00:48:01,930 --> 00:48:03,160
It felt kinda quick.

1076
00:48:03,230 --> 00:48:04,960
It was pretty quick at the end, huh?

1077
00:48:06,430 --> 00:48:10,840
Alright, the winner by points is...

1078
00:48:15,380 --> 00:48:16,380
Kubota!

1079
00:48:16,440 --> 00:48:17,710
Whoa!

1080
00:48:18,980 --> 00:48:20,310
No way!

1081
00:48:21,680 --> 00:48:22,680
Whoa!

1082
00:48:24,420 --> 00:48:26,850
Sorry, no way!

1083
00:48:30,120 --> 00:48:33,990
It was great.
You had great defense, too

1084
00:48:34,260 --> 00:48:36,000
I'm glad to be alive.
Thank you so much!

1085
00:48:37,300 --> 00:48:38,730
Good job

1086
00:48:43,400 --> 00:48:45,710
Alright, that was it.

1087
00:48:46,510 --> 00:48:48,040
How was it, everyone?

1088
00:48:48,110 --> 00:48:50,540
Well, it was, yeah...

1089
00:48:51,040 --> 00:48:53,750
Maybe it was all the nudity.

1090
00:48:55,150 --> 00:49:00,320
While watching, I was thinking
pissing Amazon off is...

1091
00:49:00,390 --> 00:49:02,890
kinda like pissing god off.

1092
00:49:02,990 --> 00:49:05,830
Not just working
but like, as a normal person.

1093
00:49:06,630 --> 00:49:08,800
I wondered it it was okay
for mere humans to do this.

1094
00:49:09,100 --> 00:49:11,230
I'm not gonna say who
screwed up.

1095
00:49:11,500 --> 00:49:15,970
But well, leaving that aside...

1096
00:49:16,270 --> 00:49:20,570
What bothered Amazon
the most was...

1097
00:49:20,640 --> 00:49:22,880
That they were gonna
release it on Christmas

1098
00:49:23,810 --> 00:49:26,410
And I guess it just wasn't...

1099
00:49:26,550 --> 00:49:29,180
that great as a Christmas present.

1100
00:49:29,620 --> 00:49:32,620
Well, as a Christmas present
to the world...

1101
00:49:33,190 --> 00:49:36,520
I think this might not be
up to Santa's standards.

1102
00:49:36,790 --> 00:49:38,320
So everything before that
was OK?

1103
00:49:38,390 --> 00:49:40,590
It was OK until then, yeah.

1104
00:49:41,660 --> 00:49:46,470
I think it was when
Soshina touched the dick.

1105
00:49:46,700 --> 00:49:47,770
Matsuo-san's?

1106
00:49:47,830 --> 00:49:49,600
Yeah, yeah, Matsuo's dick.

1107
00:49:51,270 --> 00:49:52,270
But like

1108
00:49:52,340 --> 00:49:55,010
He told me to touch it!

1109
00:49:56,110 --> 00:49:57,840
And it was really cute, right?!

1110
00:49:57,910 --> 00:49:59,180
Hello

1111
00:49:59,280 --> 00:50:00,750
Touch me!

1112
00:50:01,780 --> 00:50:03,380
I want you to caress me!

1113
00:50:03,450 --> 00:50:04,850
Can I touch you?

1114
00:50:05,280 --> 00:50:09,360
Yay! Yay!

1115
00:50:09,660 --> 00:50:11,820
It was cute.
I know you may not believe me!

1116
00:50:11,890 --> 00:50:14,260
No, I think it's fine.
It's fine, but...

1117
00:50:14,830 --> 00:50:17,060
But it went in your mouth, right?

1118
00:50:17,700 --> 00:50:19,900
Soshina smashed it
against his face.

1119
00:50:20,700 --> 00:50:24,840
But when doing it from the front
it went into Kubota's mouth, right?

1120
00:50:25,300 --> 00:50:28,770
He did it like ten times here
and a couple times in here.

1121
00:50:31,140 --> 00:50:32,380
It didn't go in, though.

1122
00:50:32,850 --> 00:50:34,450
You wanted a mosaic there?

1123
00:50:34,510 --> 00:50:35,820
It didn't go in, man!

1124
00:50:35,880 --> 00:50:36,880
Why a mosaic?

1125
00:50:36,950 --> 00:50:38,890
Come on man!
It didn't go in!

1126
00:50:39,520 --> 00:50:44,060
We just can't have someone's body parts
going inside someone else's body!

1127
00:50:46,990 --> 00:50:51,330
So can you cut it with
the whole entering a body?

1128
00:50:52,430 --> 00:50:55,640
Having said that,
Kubota was the winner.

1129
00:50:55,700 --> 00:50:56,970
Thank you very much.

1130
00:50:57,070 --> 00:50:58,170
Ten million.

1131
00:50:58,240 --> 00:50:59,070
Yeah.

1132
00:50:59,440 --> 00:51:00,410
You want it?

1133
00:51:00,510 --> 00:51:02,640
Of course I do, yeah!

1134
00:51:03,740 --> 00:51:04,780
"You want it?"

1135
00:51:04,840 --> 00:51:06,010
No, no, I mean... yes.

1136
00:51:06,080 --> 00:51:07,550
What do you think?

1137
00:51:07,680 --> 00:51:10,050
To be honest, he's a younger guy

1138
00:51:10,120 --> 00:51:12,520
so I'd like him to have it.
He worked hard.

1139
00:51:12,590 --> 00:51:15,190
But it was pretty heavy, you know...

1140
00:51:15,420 --> 00:51:16,720
Come on, don't say that!

1141
00:51:16,790 --> 00:51:19,390
Yeah, like he lost it.

1142
00:51:19,460 --> 00:51:22,260
Yeah, because this
is the opposite of a happy moment.

1143
00:51:22,430 --> 00:51:25,830
Well it's not about happy or sad.
I should go home with the money.

1144
00:51:26,600 --> 00:51:28,430
I'm in this world
because I want money.

1145
00:51:28,900 --> 00:51:31,300
But you got really mad, right?

1146
00:51:31,370 --> 00:51:33,010
No, no. I'm just saying!

1147
00:51:33,070 --> 00:51:35,980
I can take all the money with me
even if it takes a few days.

1148
00:51:36,040 --> 00:51:38,440
Come on, that's dangerous!

1149
00:51:39,410 --> 00:51:41,010
They're not gonna accept that.

1150
00:51:41,080 --> 00:51:43,550
Come on, give me the money!
I want the money!

1151
00:51:43,720 --> 00:51:46,990
So can you do this to
Amazon's big shots?

1152
00:51:47,050 --> 00:51:48,690
I'll do it in their faces, like...

1153
00:51:50,560 --> 00:51:52,590
Then it'll all be over.

1154
00:51:53,190 --> 00:51:54,860
Okay, Kubota

1155
00:51:54,930 --> 00:51:57,630
I'm confiscating the money!

1156
00:51:57,700 --> 00:51:58,660
Whoa!

1157
00:51:58,730 --> 00:52:00,900
Come on, Matsumoto-san!
Please don't do that, please!

1158
00:52:00,970 --> 00:52:03,040
For real! Please don't!

1159
00:52:03,100 --> 00:52:04,040
Confiscating?

1160
00:52:04,100 --> 00:52:07,740
I wanna give it to you,
but I'm going to take it back.

1161
00:52:07,810 --> 00:52:11,140
Come on, you can't, you can't!
I'm sorry, I'm sorry!

1162
00:52:11,210 --> 00:52:13,180
You have no say in this!

1163
00:52:13,250 --> 00:52:15,210
I'm sorry! Staff guys,
I'm sorry!

1164
00:52:15,280 --> 00:52:18,420
This isn't about Matsumoto Hitoshi!
It's just common sense!

1165
00:52:19,120 --> 00:52:20,250
I'm sorry!

1166
00:52:20,320 --> 00:52:22,020
Speaking of common sense,

1167
00:52:22,660 --> 00:52:25,420
I want to give the money to you.
I really do!

1168
00:52:25,490 --> 00:52:27,330
But it can't be helped!

1169
00:52:27,460 --> 00:52:29,130
Don't do this! Please!
Please don't!

1170
00:52:29,200 --> 00:52:30,960
It's come to this
there's nothing they can do.

1171
00:52:31,030 --> 00:52:32,970
Who is in charge?

1172
00:52:33,030 --> 00:52:35,130
(Staff)
That would be me...

1173
00:52:35,200 --> 00:52:36,670
So? What do you think?

1174
00:52:36,740 --> 00:52:39,810
To be honest,
as a project...

1175
00:52:40,010 --> 00:52:42,210
as a business,
this is unacceptable.

1176
00:52:42,280 --> 00:52:43,410
That's how it is.

1177
00:52:43,510 --> 00:52:44,780
Oh wow...

1178
00:52:46,810 --> 00:52:48,780
It was a huge deal, Kubota.

1179
00:52:48,850 --> 00:52:50,450
They're so mad at me?

1180
00:52:52,180 --> 00:52:54,220
He's turning pale!

1181
00:52:54,290 --> 00:52:55,790
That's how businesses get mad.

1182
00:52:55,890 --> 00:52:58,820
I'm just gonna hold on
to those ten million.

1183
00:52:58,920 --> 00:53:00,030
Huh? Hold on to them?

1184
00:53:00,090 --> 00:53:01,430
I'll think about it.

1185
00:53:01,890 --> 00:53:04,800
I don't wanna say much
but maybe...

1186
00:53:04,860 --> 00:53:06,430
it might carry over.

1187
00:53:07,030 --> 00:53:08,970
No, wait... come on, please!

1188
00:53:09,040 --> 00:53:10,970
We might turn it into 20 million.

1189
00:53:11,040 --> 00:53:12,070
Whoa!

1190
00:53:12,140 --> 00:53:14,740
We can take these ten million,
and you can participate then!

1191
00:53:14,810 --> 00:53:16,140
Just do the same thing again.

1192
00:53:19,280 --> 00:53:22,850
I'm not so stupid!
Only Jimmy would do that!

1193
00:53:23,350 --> 00:53:24,520
Jimmy, huh?

1194
00:54:02,000 --> 00:54:05,000
"Please watch the final hour, from the banned scene onward"

1195
00:54:13,470 --> 00:54:14,900
I'm starving.

1196
00:54:23,040 --> 00:54:24,980
Let's get along, Matsuo-san.

1197
00:54:26,050 --> 00:54:28,450
Sorry,
let's get along.

1198
00:54:30,250 --> 00:54:32,020
What happened? What was it?

1199
00:54:34,820 --> 00:54:35,820
Wait a second.

1200
00:54:35,890 --> 00:54:36,920
You took it?

1201
00:54:37,890 --> 00:54:39,190
Wait a second.

1202
00:54:39,390 --> 00:54:40,430
What happened?

1203
00:54:40,890 --> 00:54:41,990
What happened?

1204
00:54:42,230 --> 00:54:45,330
I don't know, maybe...
Maybe it was me?

1205
00:54:45,800 --> 00:54:46,800
What happened?

1206
00:54:47,900 --> 00:54:50,900
No, this is just...
I really don't know.

1207
00:54:50,970 --> 00:54:53,170
Let's wait for Matsumoto-san.

1208
00:54:53,240 --> 00:54:56,110
I just saw a normal
grin all of a sudden.

1209
00:54:56,180 --> 00:54:57,140
Who was it?

1210
00:54:59,580 --> 00:55:00,550
Two people?

1211
00:55:00,610 --> 00:55:02,350
Just Soshina.

1212
00:55:02,420 --> 00:55:04,250
No way!

1213
00:55:04,320 --> 00:55:05,920
He was smiling.

1214
00:55:06,090 --> 00:55:07,320
For real?

1215
00:55:09,190 --> 00:55:12,790
I guess a lot happened
so he was just giddy.

1216
00:55:13,030 --> 00:55:14,230
Wait a second.

1217
00:55:14,290 --> 00:55:15,630
Let's take a look.

1218
00:55:18,230 --> 00:55:19,330
See?

1219
00:55:26,440 --> 00:55:27,740
Let's get along.

1220
00:55:27,970 --> 00:55:29,840
He's smiling

1221
00:55:32,080 --> 00:55:33,210
When he said "let's get along"!

1222
00:55:33,310 --> 00:55:34,910
He did that by himself!

1223
00:55:34,980 --> 00:55:36,320
With a face and everything!

1224
00:55:36,420 --> 00:55:37,320
Let's get along, then.

1225
00:55:37,380 --> 00:55:40,750
I'm just too lonely,
and I wanted company.

1226
00:55:41,690 --> 00:55:43,120
Damn it!

1227
00:55:44,720 --> 00:55:47,730
Matsuo-san got him.

1228
00:55:53,370 --> 00:55:54,730
We do have

1229
00:55:55,700 --> 00:55:56,840
some snacks.

1230
00:55:57,170 --> 00:55:58,070
I want some!

1231
00:55:58,170 --> 00:55:59,470
I want snacks!

1232
00:56:02,910 --> 00:56:04,240
I'm _ _ _

1233
00:56:04,310 --> 00:56:05,340
I didn't get that.

1234
00:56:05,410 --> 00:56:06,750
-_ _ ko!
-We can't hear you.

1235
00:56:06,810 --> 00:56:08,550
-_ ko!
-Huh?

1236
00:56:08,610 --> 00:56:10,480
-_ _ ko!
-Pyakko?

1237
00:56:10,580 --> 00:56:11,920
I'm _ _ ko!

1238
00:56:12,650 --> 00:56:13,750
What-ko?

1239
00:56:13,820 --> 00:56:14,790
Byakko?

1240
00:56:14,950 --> 00:56:16,460
We can't hear you.

1241
00:56:17,360 --> 00:56:18,560
Sorry, Soshina.

1242
00:56:19,160 --> 00:56:20,160
Huh?

1243
00:56:20,230 --> 00:56:21,730
I'm _ _ ko!

1244
00:56:22,030 --> 00:56:23,260
Jaako?

1245
00:56:23,330 --> 00:56:24,500
_ _ ko!

1246
00:56:25,800 --> 00:56:27,430
He gained weight, huh?

1247
00:56:28,200 --> 00:56:30,100
Was that a broccoli?

1248
00:56:32,100 --> 00:56:33,310
Who are you?

1249
00:56:33,370 --> 00:56:35,070
-_ _ ko!
-Ryako?

1250
00:56:35,170 --> 00:56:37,110
_ _ ko! _ _ ko!

1251
00:56:37,180 --> 00:56:38,840
-What was it?
-I'm _ _ ko!

1252
00:56:38,910 --> 00:56:40,450
-Wanko?
-_ _ ko!

1253
00:56:41,180 --> 00:56:42,720
I really can't understand it.

1254
00:56:43,220 --> 00:56:45,150
He had something right?

1255
00:56:45,520 --> 00:56:46,950
He had two broccoli.

1256
00:56:47,020 --> 00:56:48,820
Call him, call him.

1257
00:56:50,320 --> 00:56:51,460
Yakko-san!

1258
00:56:51,890 --> 00:56:53,160
Yakko-san!

1259
00:56:55,030 --> 00:56:56,060
I'm _ _ ko.

1260
00:56:56,260 --> 00:56:57,930
What's your line of work?

1261
00:56:58,960 --> 00:57:00,930
I'm a delmo. A delmo.

1262
00:57:01,070 --> 00:57:02,130
A delmo?

1263
00:57:02,230 --> 00:57:03,370
Ah, a model.

1264
00:57:03,740 --> 00:57:05,440
What has she done?

1265
00:57:06,510 --> 00:57:08,010
What have you done?

1266
00:57:08,270 --> 00:57:11,380
I'm sure you've appeared
on mags or something, right?

1267
00:57:11,880 --> 00:57:13,110
M and M.

1268
00:57:13,380 --> 00:57:14,710
M and M?

1269
00:57:15,080 --> 00:57:16,680
M&M's? The chocolates?

1270
00:57:16,750 --> 00:57:18,150
How old are you?

1271
00:57:18,420 --> 00:57:20,620
A magazine. Magazine.

1272
00:57:21,190 --> 00:57:22,760
What?
It's a magazine.

1273
00:57:22,820 --> 00:57:24,320
A pageantry?
A magazine.

1274
00:57:24,390 --> 00:57:25,620
A magazine?
Yes.

1275
00:57:27,030 --> 00:57:28,330
What's with that?

1276
00:57:29,400 --> 00:57:30,960
I don't get it at all.

1277
00:57:31,030 --> 00:57:32,300
A magazine?

1278
00:57:32,360 --> 00:57:34,130
Come on!

1279
00:57:37,840 --> 00:57:38,940
There it is!

1280
00:57:39,270 --> 00:57:40,840
He's coming here?

1281
00:57:41,870 --> 00:57:43,140
Can you see me?

1282
00:57:45,010 --> 00:57:47,210
That type of body...

1283
00:57:47,710 --> 00:57:49,180
Who are you?
One more time!

1284
00:57:49,250 --> 00:57:50,180
_ _ ko!

1285
00:57:50,520 --> 00:57:52,020
-Rakko?
-_ _ ko!

1286
00:57:52,280 --> 00:57:53,620
-Rakka?
-_ _ ko!

1287
00:57:53,720 --> 00:57:54,890
-Rakka?
-_ _ ko

1288
00:57:54,950 --> 00:57:56,160
-Ouch!
-What-ko?

1289
00:57:56,260 --> 00:57:57,890
-Ranko!
-What're you doing?

1290
00:57:57,960 --> 00:57:59,090
-I'm Ranko!
-What-ko?

1291
00:57:59,160 --> 00:58:00,660
-Ranko!
-What's he doing?

1292
00:58:00,730 --> 00:58:05,400
Ranko!

1293
00:58:05,500 --> 00:58:06,830
What's that?

1294
00:58:07,770 --> 00:58:08,900
Stop it!

1295
00:58:08,970 --> 00:58:10,400
I'm gonna kill you!

1296
00:58:11,270 --> 00:58:12,240
I'm gonna kill you!

1297
00:58:13,370 --> 00:58:14,370
It's a bazooka.

1298
00:58:14,440 --> 00:58:15,470
Kubota

1299
00:58:15,670 --> 00:58:16,580
Don't get any closer!

1300
00:58:16,640 --> 00:58:17,740
Senpai!

1301
00:58:18,480 --> 00:58:19,980
He's your senpai!

1302
00:58:20,050 --> 00:58:21,010
I'm gonna kill you

1303
00:58:21,110 --> 00:58:22,820
-Kubota
-Don't get closer!

1304
00:58:22,980 --> 00:58:24,120
I can do it any time.

1305
00:58:24,880 --> 00:58:26,220
Ouch!

1306
00:58:26,790 --> 00:58:28,090
Kubota-san. You okay?

1307
00:58:28,150 --> 00:58:30,360
That's a fucking heavy broccoli!

1308
00:58:31,190 --> 00:58:32,520
Broccoli

1309
00:58:33,390 --> 00:58:34,530
Huh?

1310
00:58:34,830 --> 00:58:35,830
It wasn't me.

1311
00:58:36,400 --> 00:58:37,700
You were smiling, yeah.

1312
00:58:37,700 --> 00:58:38,160
Smiling a lot.

1313
00:58:38,700 --> 00:58:40,570
Smiling a lot

1314
00:58:40,630 --> 00:58:43,140
Me? Me?!

1315
00:58:43,200 --> 00:58:46,840
It's a solid broccoli.
You smiled when you said broccoli.

1316
00:58:46,940 --> 00:58:48,540
-No way!
-He's smiling!

1317
00:58:48,670 --> 00:58:50,210
-Who was it?
-I smiled?

1318
00:58:50,640 --> 00:58:52,010
You did.

1319
00:58:52,080 --> 00:58:54,080
No way, I- I...

1320
00:58:57,150 --> 00:58:58,450
It was definitely Jimmy

1321
00:58:58,920 --> 00:59:00,650
He did it himself, right?

1322
00:59:00,720 --> 00:59:02,220
He was smiling normally.

1323
00:59:02,350 --> 00:59:04,260
He smiled after
saying "broccoli"

1324
00:59:04,320 --> 00:59:05,820
All the time.

1325
00:59:06,930 --> 00:59:08,090
For real?

1326
00:59:08,890 --> 00:59:10,100
For real!

1327
00:59:11,000 --> 00:59:12,400
For real

1328
00:59:13,370 --> 00:59:16,670
He's your senpai!

1329
00:59:16,900 --> 00:59:17,870
I'm gonna kill you

1330
00:59:17,940 --> 00:59:18,940
Kubota!

1331
00:59:19,000 --> 00:59:20,840
Don't get any closer.
I can do it anytime.

1332
00:59:21,670 --> 00:59:23,010
Ouch!

1333
00:59:23,510 --> 00:59:24,680
Kubota-san. You okay?

1334
00:59:24,740 --> 00:59:27,310
It's a damned heavy broccoli!

1335
00:59:28,010 --> 00:59:29,180
Broccoli.

1336
00:59:29,950 --> 00:59:30,950
Huh?

1337
00:59:31,180 --> 00:59:32,120
Leave.

1338
00:59:32,650 --> 00:59:33,750
No way!

1339
00:59:38,820 --> 00:59:39,930
For real.

1340
00:59:40,460 --> 00:59:42,590
But you did well today.

1341
00:59:42,730 --> 00:59:44,530
I smiled?

1342
00:59:45,700 --> 00:59:47,700
Of course you were smiling!

1343
00:59:47,830 --> 00:59:49,270
All the time!

1344
00:59:49,330 --> 00:59:51,770
I was being forgiving, actually.

1345
00:59:58,080 --> 00:59:59,450
He can't accept it.

1346
00:59:59,510 --> 01:00:02,550
I don't get what
he won't accept.

1347
01:00:02,750 --> 01:00:06,320
To be honest, this is
the first time I made it this far.

1348
01:00:07,550 --> 01:00:09,090
No, no, no.

1349
01:00:09,150 --> 01:00:10,790
Watch out watch out!

1350
01:00:11,190 --> 01:00:15,360
It felt like for a second
I might've done it.

1351
01:00:15,560 --> 01:00:19,360
But once I got the orange,
I had to watch out.

1352
01:00:19,470 --> 01:00:21,730
And I was out
before I realized.

1353
01:00:22,500 --> 01:00:25,470
Wanna go on a camping trip,
Maki-kun?

1354
01:00:25,570 --> 01:00:28,370
-I guess so, next time!
-Let's think about it!

1355
01:00:32,980 --> 01:00:34,480
Let's go with zombie time.

1356
01:00:35,510 --> 01:00:38,250
Zombie time!

1357
01:00:41,220 --> 01:00:42,720
The zombies are here...

1358
01:00:43,160 --> 01:00:44,520
Watch out!

1359
01:00:44,890 --> 01:00:47,990
Sit down.
You have to watch it.

1360
01:00:48,060 --> 01:00:49,290
Watch out!

1361
01:00:54,330 --> 01:00:55,530
What's going on?

1362
01:00:58,400 --> 01:00:59,910
That's a tiny face.

1363
01:01:00,070 --> 01:01:02,010
It's way too tiny.

1364
01:01:16,120 --> 01:01:17,620
He just walked by.

1365
01:01:17,920 --> 01:01:19,660
It's like a monster.

1366
01:01:19,760 --> 01:01:21,060
He walked by.

1367
01:01:21,730 --> 01:01:22,900
That's creepy

1368
01:01:22,960 --> 01:01:25,360
The face was way too tiny.

1369
01:01:26,770 --> 01:01:27,800
Where did it go?

1370
01:01:27,870 --> 01:01:29,270
That's not a performance.

1371
01:01:29,970 --> 01:01:31,140
Whoa!

1372
01:01:31,300 --> 01:01:33,410
He went to the back!

1373
01:01:33,510 --> 01:01:34,670
The back?

1374
01:01:35,140 --> 01:01:35,840
The strobe?

1375
01:01:35,840 --> 01:01:36,280
Strobe?

1376
01:01:37,810 --> 01:01:39,110
Whoa!

1377
01:01:49,290 --> 01:01:50,360
Damn it

1378
01:01:58,300 --> 01:01:59,570
It's not moving.

1379
01:01:59,770 --> 01:02:00,830
What?

1380
01:02:00,900 --> 01:02:01,970
It's not moving.

1381
01:02:06,410 --> 01:02:07,410
Whoa!

1382
01:02:17,000 --> 01:02:20,000
"Don Frye" (EN: 12)

1383
01:02:37,900 --> 01:02:39,100
Come on!

1384
01:02:40,670 --> 01:02:42,010
Come on!

1385
01:02:47,980 --> 01:02:49,380
Don Frye? Really?

1386
01:02:49,450 --> 01:02:50,650
Don Frye.

1387
01:02:51,220 --> 01:02:54,490
That was bad! Move more!

1388
01:02:54,920 --> 01:02:56,220
I was two seconds away

1389
01:02:56,290 --> 01:02:57,590
Move more!

1390
01:02:58,190 --> 01:03:00,060
That was definitely Soshina!

1391
01:03:00,130 --> 01:03:01,630
I did it!
You did.

1392
01:03:01,730 --> 01:03:03,700
I knew I was in trouble
from the beginning.

1393
01:03:03,760 --> 01:03:06,160
Kubota was struggling too!

1394
01:03:06,230 --> 01:03:07,370
I was pretty close

1395
01:03:07,430 --> 01:03:08,400
You held it?

1396
01:03:08,470 --> 01:03:10,400
I was two seconds away, though.

1397
01:03:15,510 --> 01:03:16,880
It's not moving.

1398
01:03:17,040 --> 01:03:18,440
What?

1399
01:03:23,550 --> 01:03:24,450
Whoa!

1400
01:03:36,300 --> 01:03:39,830
"Don Frye"

1401
01:03:55,180 --> 01:03:56,380
Come on!

1402
01:03:56,750 --> 01:03:58,720
Okay Soshina, you're out!

1403
01:04:07,090 --> 01:04:10,030
That was just...
Move more!

1404
01:04:10,100 --> 01:04:11,560
Okay, let's go Soshina.

1405
01:04:11,630 --> 01:04:13,070
Let's go with Nadal.

1406
01:04:13,900 --> 01:04:15,400
Don't come back as a zombie.

1407
01:04:15,470 --> 01:04:17,070
Run away!

1408
01:04:17,140 --> 01:04:20,670
It was so fun!

1409
01:04:20,910 --> 01:04:26,910
I brought a huge bag.
And I was pretty prepared.

1410
01:04:26,980 --> 01:04:30,220
But at some point I...

1411
01:04:30,720 --> 01:04:35,520
let people around me attack
and that was fun.

1412
01:04:35,990 --> 01:04:37,390
That's the sound already.

1413
01:04:37,960 --> 01:04:39,120
It's short!

1414
01:04:39,690 --> 01:04:41,030
Don't say it's short.

1415
01:04:41,590 --> 01:04:42,630
It's long!

1416
01:04:42,890 --> 01:04:46,200
There weren't many
straight men here.

1417
01:04:46,260 --> 01:04:49,000
So I just adapted to it.

1418
01:04:49,170 --> 01:04:51,440
So I watched out
for their attacks.

1419
01:04:51,540 --> 01:04:55,070
I think I did that well.
It was fun.

1420
01:04:55,840 --> 01:04:57,840
It really felt like a dream.

1421
01:05:22,870 --> 01:05:24,340
Alright.

1422
01:05:31,640 --> 01:05:33,180
I'll get one.

1423
01:05:39,820 --> 01:05:43,160
Sorry. Can you take that off?

1424
01:05:43,620 --> 01:05:44,760
This?

1425
01:05:45,390 --> 01:05:46,490
It's tight.

1426
01:05:48,260 --> 01:05:50,230
Thank you so much.

1427
01:05:53,400 --> 01:05:55,700
These are seven bras.

1428
01:05:56,470 --> 01:06:00,140
It's made with seven bras.
It's great!

1429
01:06:00,810 --> 01:06:04,210
It's so I'm always
thinking about boobs.

1430
01:06:06,180 --> 01:06:07,410
Looks warm.

1431
01:06:07,510 --> 01:06:10,280
I can put it on easily
with the hooks.

1432
01:06:11,520 --> 01:06:13,220
And it's good practice too

1433
01:06:13,620 --> 01:06:14,620
Practice...

1434
01:06:14,690 --> 01:06:15,850
They're all different.

1435
01:06:16,090 --> 01:06:18,460
Yeah, they're all different bras...

1436
01:06:18,990 --> 01:06:20,830
I could've used only a couple

1437
01:06:21,030 --> 01:06:24,000
But I wouldn't let myself.

1438
01:06:24,060 --> 01:06:25,360
What's the criteria?

1439
01:06:25,430 --> 01:06:26,630
No criteria,

1440
01:06:26,700 --> 01:06:29,500
but the clothes were good
and they had ribbons.

1441
01:06:29,670 --> 01:06:31,040
It's cute. Pretty cute.

1442
01:06:31,800 --> 01:06:33,710
Try putting it on.

1443
01:06:33,870 --> 01:06:35,270
It's soft.

1444
01:06:38,840 --> 01:06:42,610
Looks good. Make sure it's
sitting correctly over your ear.

1445
01:06:42,680 --> 01:06:44,620
It's really nice.

1446
01:06:44,680 --> 01:06:47,190
Right? This part is good too

1447
01:06:47,650 --> 01:06:51,190
I'm gonna take it off
and put it again.

1448
01:06:51,920 --> 01:06:54,330
I've called it the brahat.

1449
01:06:56,190 --> 01:06:58,030
-How is it?
-It's great!

1450
01:06:58,360 --> 01:06:59,360
I know!

1451
01:07:00,370 --> 01:07:02,000
-Wanna wear it?
-Yeah.

1452
01:07:03,800 --> 01:07:05,400
Isn't this expensive?

1453
01:07:05,900 --> 01:07:10,510
Buying one by one was like...
¥60,000 more or less.

1454
01:07:10,840 --> 01:07:11,780
¥60,000?

1455
01:07:11,910 --> 01:07:13,250
I wanted big cups.

1456
01:07:13,310 --> 01:07:15,050
It's warm!

1457
01:07:16,280 --> 01:07:17,280
It's good, huh?

1458
01:07:17,380 --> 01:07:18,750
This too!

1459
01:07:18,850 --> 01:07:19,890
It's gonna break.

1460
01:07:19,990 --> 01:07:21,290
Yeah, yeah.

1461
01:07:22,190 --> 01:07:23,560
Give it back.

1462
01:07:29,690 --> 01:07:31,700
Huh? I've seen him before.

1463
01:07:37,500 --> 01:07:39,570
Seen him before for sure...

1464
01:07:51,720 --> 01:07:53,750
-Sushi.
-Is that him?

1465
01:07:53,820 --> 01:07:56,450
-Sushi.
-Looks like him.

1466
01:07:57,060 --> 01:08:00,490
Sorry.
What's your name?

1467
01:08:02,230 --> 01:08:03,300
Sushi

1468
01:08:05,500 --> 01:08:06,630
Sushi

1469
01:08:06,700 --> 01:08:07,830
Sushi

1470
01:08:08,900 --> 01:08:10,140
Sushi?

1471
01:08:11,770 --> 01:08:13,640
The one you eat?

1472
01:08:13,970 --> 01:08:16,140
No. Sushi

1473
01:08:16,610 --> 01:08:17,780
And your name?

1474
01:08:20,410 --> 01:08:21,480
It's Sushi.

1475
01:08:22,050 --> 01:08:24,350
He said Sushi, right?

1476
01:08:24,580 --> 01:08:26,590
A song? Can you sing?

1477
01:08:26,920 --> 01:08:28,550
I sing.

1478
01:08:29,120 --> 01:08:30,420
With a band?

1479
01:08:30,520 --> 01:08:33,090
We're five.

1480
01:08:33,530 --> 01:08:34,860
So he's definitely...

1481
01:08:35,560 --> 01:08:36,660
What was it?

1482
01:08:36,730 --> 01:08:37,730
Your group?

1483
01:08:38,460 --> 01:08:42,230
Hex-hex-hex Hex Japon.

1484
01:08:42,900 --> 01:08:44,100
Hex Japon.

1485
01:08:44,570 --> 01:08:45,970
Hex Japon?

1486
01:08:46,040 --> 01:08:47,540
Hex Japon

1487
01:08:47,940 --> 01:08:48,970
Huh?

1488
01:08:51,380 --> 01:08:52,780
Hex Japon?

1489
01:08:53,580 --> 01:08:54,810
Sing one for us.

1490
01:08:54,880 --> 01:08:58,020
I can't sing a song now, but...

1491
01:09:04,160 --> 01:09:06,320
This is it for you guys.

1492
01:09:09,830 --> 01:09:13,100
I'm gonna kill you all right now!

1493
01:09:13,830 --> 01:09:16,840
I'm gonna build a school in Africa!

1494
01:09:18,700 --> 01:09:20,810
Is he good or bad?

1495
01:09:21,340 --> 01:09:23,110
Is he good or bad?

1496
01:09:23,540 --> 01:09:24,740
Why do you have to kill us?

1497
01:09:24,810 --> 01:09:28,310
I'm gonna pull out your eyeballs,

1498
01:09:30,280 --> 01:09:32,720
and bring water to the Thai people!

1499
01:09:34,050 --> 01:09:35,050
He's a good guy

1500
01:09:35,120 --> 01:09:37,620
Is he good or bad?
He's really good

1501
01:09:38,720 --> 01:09:40,590
He does good
and then bad.

1502
01:09:41,730 --> 01:09:44,000
I'm gonna murder your parents

1503
01:09:44,060 --> 01:09:45,560
Stop it

1504
01:09:45,800 --> 01:09:48,130
And pay for my sister's studies!

1505
01:09:49,600 --> 01:09:50,540
He's good

1506
01:09:50,600 --> 01:09:52,370
He's super good

1507
01:09:54,170 --> 01:09:55,470
He looks bad, though

1508
01:09:57,940 --> 01:10:01,250
I'm gonna pull out all your teeth

1509
01:10:02,950 --> 01:10:04,980
So please be my friend!

1510
01:10:09,550 --> 01:10:12,220
I can't be friends with someone like that.

1511
01:10:19,360 --> 01:10:20,900
Now...

1512
01:10:25,000 --> 01:10:27,670
Line up in the first row.

1513
01:10:29,270 --> 01:10:31,940
You've been here before?

1514
01:10:32,080 --> 01:10:33,180
Yes.

1515
01:10:33,380 --> 01:10:36,280
Okay.
Keep going.

1516
01:10:36,550 --> 01:10:40,620
No, I just
want to buy a ticket.

1517
01:10:41,150 --> 01:10:44,260
He's a good guy.
It makes sense.

1518
01:10:47,390 --> 01:10:49,730
Feel free to come.

1519
01:10:49,790 --> 01:10:51,730
I feel bad for
the fan club guys

1520
01:10:51,800 --> 01:10:53,870
Yeah, thank you.

1521
01:10:54,030 --> 01:10:55,800
What's with you?

1522
01:10:55,870 --> 01:10:58,540
Gaggy! Welcome!

1523
01:10:58,640 --> 01:11:00,370
What's with you?

1524
01:11:00,440 --> 01:11:01,510
Gaggy!

1525
01:11:02,670 --> 01:11:03,810
Gaggy!

1526
01:11:04,210 --> 01:11:06,240
I came to the village Gaggy

1527
01:11:06,910 --> 01:11:11,320
Hello. I came here.
Gaggy village, right?

1528
01:11:11,780 --> 01:11:13,890
Long live Gaggy village!

1529
01:11:14,150 --> 01:11:17,660
Long live Gaggy village!
Thank you very much!

1530
01:11:18,020 --> 01:11:21,730
I love Gaggy-sama.
That's why I'm here.

1531
01:11:21,890 --> 01:11:23,660
I can do a bit more Gaggy-sama.

1532
01:11:23,730 --> 01:11:25,800
This is what I am
without Gaggy-sama.

1533
01:11:25,960 --> 01:11:29,730
This is someone else.
We're almost the same. We're twins.

1534
01:11:31,140 --> 01:11:32,270
I'm a twin.

1535
01:11:34,240 --> 01:11:35,540
He shaved it?

1536
01:11:36,910 --> 01:11:38,710
I want to be like Gaggy.

1537
01:11:39,540 --> 01:11:41,980
I'm almost there!

1538
01:11:47,690 --> 01:11:48,720
Kill him.

1539
01:11:48,790 --> 01:11:49,790
Huh?

1540
01:11:50,190 --> 01:11:51,290
Kill him.

1541
01:11:51,390 --> 01:11:53,190
-Kill?
-Please kill him.

1542
01:11:53,290 --> 01:11:54,290
Kill him...

1543
01:11:54,360 --> 01:11:56,930
You can't just kill him.

1544
01:11:57,600 --> 01:11:59,760
Kill him. That's just it.

1545
01:11:59,830 --> 01:12:01,030
You can't kill.

1546
01:12:01,370 --> 01:12:02,530
Kill him.

1547
01:12:03,330 --> 01:12:06,200
You can't kill him. That's no good!

1548
01:12:07,570 --> 01:12:09,540
Why did I have this all this time?

1549
01:12:10,110 --> 01:12:11,380
For six hours?

1550
01:12:12,340 --> 01:12:14,250
Was there a reason?
It's just...

1551
01:12:14,980 --> 01:12:16,210
Look at it.

1552
01:12:19,780 --> 01:12:21,490
What's the point, then?

1553
01:12:39,540 --> 01:12:41,370
Let's go for another zombie time.

1554
01:12:42,440 --> 01:12:43,610
Here we go

1555
01:12:44,040 --> 01:12:46,780
Zombie time

1556
01:12:52,250 --> 01:12:53,890
Here he comes

1557
01:12:54,290 --> 01:12:56,190
Huh? Only three people?

1558
01:13:01,030 --> 01:13:02,790
I'm Enu from the youth clinic.

1559
01:13:03,130 --> 01:13:04,260
Shu!

1560
01:13:06,100 --> 01:13:10,700
I'll do a song about
whatever you guys say.

1561
01:13:10,770 --> 01:13:12,400
Say whatever you want.

1562
01:13:12,540 --> 01:13:14,810
-Sushi.
-Please go with other people.

1563
01:13:14,870 --> 01:13:16,940
-People?
-Comedians?

1564
01:13:17,010 --> 01:13:19,980
Kubota-san, Inada-san or Matsuo-san.

1565
01:13:20,480 --> 01:13:21,610
Ina-chan.

1566
01:13:21,680 --> 01:13:22,750
Here I go.

1567
01:13:23,050 --> 01:13:26,150
Hey hey, Inada! Hey Inada!

1568
01:13:26,220 --> 01:13:29,990
You're close, close, close.
Really close!

1569
01:13:31,760 --> 01:13:34,490
You're gonna keep this up?
For real?

1570
01:13:34,960 --> 01:13:36,090
-You're gonna keep it up?
-I am.

1571
01:13:36,160 --> 01:13:39,130
The broadcast code?
That's what was close?

1572
01:13:39,600 --> 01:13:41,270
Sorry.
You really think so?

1573
01:13:41,400 --> 01:13:43,300
No, I'm an idiot.

1574
01:13:43,540 --> 01:13:44,540
An idiot?

1575
01:13:45,040 --> 01:13:47,640
Can you do me? Please.

1576
01:13:48,010 --> 01:13:51,040
Hey hey Kubota! Hey Kubota!

1577
01:13:51,140 --> 01:13:54,980
Bald fat, bald fat, fat fat
glasses.

1578
01:13:56,150 --> 01:13:57,650
Come on...

1579
01:13:58,550 --> 01:14:00,020
You're just criticizing.

1580
01:14:00,450 --> 01:14:01,720
It depends...

1581
01:14:01,790 --> 01:14:03,590
You're just talking about appearance...

1582
01:14:03,690 --> 01:14:05,960
You're just criticizing.
Do something serious.

1583
01:14:06,020 --> 01:14:07,260
He's just being rough.

1584
01:14:07,390 --> 01:14:08,790
Do one more.

1585
01:14:09,090 --> 01:14:10,960
Do Kubota.
But for real.

1586
01:14:13,260 --> 01:14:16,470
Hey hey Kubota! Hey Kubota!

1587
01:14:16,530 --> 01:14:20,070
You're really funny
when you say the truth.

1588
01:14:20,540 --> 01:14:23,140
Huh? What was that?
You making fun of me?

1589
01:14:23,440 --> 01:14:25,310
No, he did a 180.

1590
01:14:26,010 --> 01:14:27,480
Quiet, quiet.

1591
01:14:28,050 --> 01:14:29,450
We're not being loud.

1592
01:14:29,510 --> 01:14:31,480
Okay, do him now.

1593
01:14:31,550 --> 01:14:32,520
Mat-chan...

1594
01:14:33,050 --> 01:14:35,990
Hey hey Matsuo! Hey Matsuo!

1595
01:14:36,250 --> 01:14:39,960
Your skin is a mess
your haircut is weird!

1596
01:14:40,430 --> 01:14:42,290
Stop it, man!

1597
01:14:42,730 --> 01:14:46,300
It was more boring than I thought.
I wanted it to be brutal.

1598
01:14:46,360 --> 01:14:47,600
Quiet, quiet.

1599
01:14:59,110 --> 01:15:00,610
Time's almost up.

1600
01:15:02,250 --> 01:15:03,280
What's wrong?

1601
01:15:07,090 --> 01:15:09,890
Someone was here?
You talked?

1602
01:15:11,260 --> 01:15:14,160
Good morning.
Good morning.

1603
01:15:14,630 --> 01:15:16,060
What happened?
Did you talk?

1604
01:15:17,160 --> 01:15:19,060
Did you feel strange?

1605
01:15:19,860 --> 01:15:21,030
No, no.

1606
01:15:22,700 --> 01:15:23,700
Where's Gosuke?

1607
01:15:23,900 --> 01:15:25,140
He's not here.

1608
01:15:31,180 --> 01:15:32,380
Time over

1609
01:15:33,580 --> 01:15:35,350
It's over.
It's over?

1610
01:15:41,720 --> 01:15:44,290
It's finished!

1611
01:15:45,420 --> 01:15:46,660
That was kinda quick.

1612
01:15:46,720 --> 01:15:48,590
It felt quick at the end.

1613
01:15:49,860 --> 01:15:54,100
Alright, the winner by points is...

1614
01:15:57,470 --> 01:15:58,600
Kubota!

1615
01:16:01,010 --> 01:16:02,410
No way!

1616
01:16:03,680 --> 01:16:04,680
Whoa!

1617
01:16:04,740 --> 01:16:06,280
He won five points.

1618
01:16:07,110 --> 01:16:08,150
Here you go

1619
01:16:09,050 --> 01:16:10,110
Huh?!

1620
01:16:10,680 --> 01:16:11,780
I'm sorry!

1621
01:16:12,120 --> 01:16:13,250
No way!

1622
01:16:16,420 --> 01:16:20,160
It was incredible.
Your defense was awesome.

1623
01:16:20,590 --> 01:16:21,930
Thank you so much.

1624
01:16:21,990 --> 01:16:24,960
You did everyone in.

1625
01:16:25,300 --> 01:16:28,330
To be honest, I had never
sucked so many cocks before.

1626
01:16:29,500 --> 01:16:33,040
Let's hope it doesn't count
as porn money.

1627
01:16:35,670 --> 01:16:37,710
He was talking
so much about the money.

1628
01:16:38,810 --> 01:16:40,550
I'm glad to be alive.
Thank you very much!

1629
01:16:41,880 --> 01:16:43,450
Good job!
