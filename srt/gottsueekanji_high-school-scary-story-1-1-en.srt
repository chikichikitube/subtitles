HIGHSCHOOL
SCARY STORY

4
00:00:07,990 --> 00:00:10,260
What a relief

5
00:00:11,520 --> 00:00:12,560
Ya spyin' on us?

6
00:00:13,030 --> 00:00:15,660
Ya know, I'm the type to stay behind

7
00:00:15,660 --> 00:00:16,860
He's peepin'!

8
00:00:17,130 --> 00:00:18,500
Got me, dude

9
00:00:19,200 --> 00:00:20,300
Hey, hey!

10
00:00:21,000 --> 00:00:22,430
Dontcha think it stinks?

11
00:00:24,040 --> 00:00:25,040
Yeah, it stinks!

12
00:00:27,610 --> 00:00:28,940
He's doin' it!

13
00:00:30,210 --> 00:00:31,910
For real?
- You serious?

14
00:00:33,180 --> 00:00:36,750
Come on man, taking a dump at school...

15
00:00:40,450 --> 00:00:42,020
It stinks, dude!

16
00:00:42,290 --> 00:00:44,260
Come on man!

17
00:00:44,660 --> 00:00:47,330
Don't take a shit at school, man!

18
00:00:49,660 --> 00:00:51,730
UNBABA!!

19
00:00:49,660 --> 00:00:53,330
note: pun on "unko" and "baba" (both "poop")

20
00:00:59,200 --> 00:01:01,440
Who made my toilet stall dirty?!

21
00:01:06,810 --> 00:01:08,110
note: on the box: "unbaba"

22
00:01:16,990 --> 00:01:17,990
That hurt

23
00:01:17,990 --> 00:01:18,920
It's poop!

24
00:01:18,920 --> 00:01:21,260
People always keep saying stuff like

25
00:01:21,260 --> 00:01:23,600
"You could be lucky or unlucky"

26
00:01:23,600 --> 00:01:25,960
But I just realized that's true

27
00:01:25,960 --> 00:01:28,200
After looking at you punks!

28
00:01:36,170 --> 00:01:37,540
Why did he skip that one?

29
00:01:37,540 --> 00:01:38,210
No idea

30
00:01:38,210 --> 00:01:41,810
"Fate" is not something you
wait, is something you grasp!

31
00:01:38,210 --> 00:01:41,810
note: pun - "un" is both "fate" and "poop"

32
00:01:47,650 --> 00:01:48,450
This--

33
00:01:48,750 --> 00:01:49,690
Can we stop this?

34
00:01:51,190 --> 00:01:52,220
This is harsh

35
00:01:53,790 --> 00:01:54,890
This is painful

36
00:01:57,130 --> 00:01:58,300
Painful...

37
00:01:59,230 --> 00:02:01,800
- Dangerous too
- And scary

38
00:02:02,670 --> 00:02:04,100
It's just... sad

39
00:02:05,200 --> 00:02:07,210
Alright, let's stop this

40
00:02:07,440 --> 00:02:10,140
Don't worry, you gave your best

41
00:02:10,140 --> 00:02:11,980
Isn't that right?
- Yes, it is

42
00:02:11,980 --> 00:02:15,450
- He gave his best
- He did good

43
00:02:15,450 --> 00:02:16,280
Thank you

44
00:02:17,250 --> 00:02:19,720
I tried to say something till the end, but...

45
00:02:21,090 --> 00:02:22,320
You reached your limit?

46
00:02:25,660 --> 00:02:26,930
He reached it

47
00:02:27,990 --> 00:02:30,200
What if next week someone else does it?

48
00:02:31,560 --> 00:02:32,960
That thing?

49
00:02:33,330 --> 00:02:35,530
No one wants to, after looking at you!

50
00:02:37,470 --> 00:02:38,840
You said that yourself

51
00:02:39,800 --> 00:02:40,610
Higashino

52
00:02:41,970 --> 00:02:44,240
- Unbaba, next week
- Unbaba next week?!

53
00:02:44,240 --> 00:02:45,280
Yeah, I'm done

54
00:02:46,310 --> 00:02:48,950
You just have to remember this dance

55
00:02:49,550 --> 00:02:52,280
- I just can't---
- Alright, I'll do it

56
00:02:52,280 --> 00:02:52,880
Let's do this

57
00:02:52,880 --> 00:02:54,050
It's painful

58
00:02:55,050 --> 00:02:57,160
- Let's call it a day
- Alright

59
00:02:57,160 --> 00:02:58,860
You did good, man

60
00:02:58,860 --> 00:02:59,990
Don't worry about it

61
00:02:59,990 --> 00:03:02,390
It was clumsy
- Don't worry, it was fun

62
00:03:02,390 --> 00:03:04,400
- Good job, guys!
- See you
