00:00:15,000 --> 00:00:22,000
Subbed by Thanos-no-Tsukai
Thanks For Watching!

2
00:00:24,690 --> 00:00:26,760
To put it simply, we got...

3
00:00:26,820 --> 00:00:27,920
into a bit of trouble.

4
00:00:28,260 --> 00:00:29,290
Trouble?

5
00:00:35,100 --> 00:00:37,070
In any case, it was vulgar.

6
00:00:37,170 --> 00:00:38,700
That's not
the first time, though.

7
00:00:38,800 --> 00:00:41,170
We used to think that Amazon

8
00:00:41,240 --> 00:00:43,470
was this bottomless pit,

9
00:00:44,670 --> 00:00:45,740
and everything went.

10
00:00:45,840 --> 00:00:47,680
We don't know either,

11
00:00:50,210 --> 00:00:52,350
so we want to find out today

12
00:00:52,410 --> 00:00:55,280
what went wrong with you guys.

13
00:01:02,860 --> 00:01:04,660
You're the worst, man.

14
00:01:17,910 --> 00:01:19,310
Here we go!

15
00:01:24,410 --> 00:01:26,880
I was cleaning up
and found this porno.

16
00:01:26,980 --> 00:01:27,980
Show me!

17
00:01:28,050 --> 00:01:29,180
It's one of these mags

18
00:01:29,250 --> 00:01:30,490
That's nostalgic!

19
00:01:30,550 --> 00:01:31,950
From long ago

20
00:01:33,190 --> 00:01:34,660
And there's this older girl

21
00:01:34,720 --> 00:01:36,090
She's an old hag!

22
00:01:36,930 --> 00:01:38,330
Naoka...

23
00:01:38,860 --> 00:01:39,990
Jimmy-san!

24
00:01:41,260 --> 00:01:42,600
You like it?

25
00:01:46,430 --> 00:01:47,740
That's quite...

26
00:01:47,900 --> 00:01:49,470
Quite mature!

27
00:01:49,840 --> 00:01:51,710
She's in her 50's.

28
00:01:52,610 --> 00:01:53,680
Just perfect!

29
00:01:54,510 --> 00:01:55,780
She's pissing?

30
00:01:56,710 --> 00:01:57,810
Outside, right?

31
00:01:57,910 --> 00:01:59,350
Seems like she's taking a big piss.

32
00:01:59,580 --> 00:02:01,680
I mean, you like who you like.

33
00:02:01,750 --> 00:02:04,990
I love this!

34
00:02:06,220 --> 00:02:07,920
I'm crazy for her!

35
00:02:08,060 --> 00:02:09,360
You like it...?

36
00:02:10,260 --> 00:02:11,590
Is it wrong
if I like this?

37
00:02:11,660 --> 00:02:12,590
She's thick.

38
00:02:12,660 --> 00:02:14,730
This is good!

39
00:02:14,860 --> 00:02:17,100
She's too hairy

40
00:02:17,170 --> 00:02:18,970
It suited people back then.

41
00:02:19,070 --> 00:02:20,800
—Take a look
I'm doing that.

42
00:02:21,400 --> 00:02:23,610
She's stepping all over
her own piss, man.

43
00:02:26,670 --> 00:02:28,380
But old pictures are good.

44
00:02:28,480 --> 00:02:31,510
It's nice that girls back then
were thick and hot.

45
00:02:31,580 --> 00:02:32,750
Way better.

46
00:02:34,020 --> 00:02:35,720
Can you step aside?

47
00:02:35,980 --> 00:02:37,350
You're pretty direct.

48
00:02:38,790 --> 00:02:41,320
You've been all serious
for a while.

49
00:02:41,690 --> 00:02:43,890
No, I just
respect my elders.

50
00:02:43,960 --> 00:02:45,660
That's why you were
acting all formal?

51
00:02:45,730 --> 00:02:46,760
That's enough.

52
00:02:46,830 --> 00:02:48,730
You're too good.
Your humor's too good.

53
00:02:48,800 --> 00:02:51,600
For real, you're brilliant.

54
00:02:51,900 --> 00:02:53,000
Wanna team up?

55
00:02:53,270 --> 00:02:56,440
Team up?
What about Rossy? (Editor's Note: 1)

56
00:02:56,500 --> 00:02:57,970
There you go again, man.

57
00:03:01,880 --> 00:03:03,810
Can I show something to you guys?

58
00:03:03,880 --> 00:03:05,150
It's one picture.

59
00:03:08,480 --> 00:03:11,290
I got a small envelope in the mail.

60
00:03:11,890 --> 00:03:14,960
My real name is Sasaki, right? (EN: 2)

61
00:03:15,020 --> 00:03:17,060
—My address was at the top.
—You're Sasaki?

62
00:03:17,190 --> 00:03:18,390
Then what's Nadal?

63
00:03:18,460 --> 00:03:20,900
—I'm Nadal.
—I'm talking about me.

64
00:03:21,730 --> 00:03:22,760
Sorry.

65
00:03:24,430 --> 00:03:25,500
Aiura...

66
00:03:25,570 --> 00:03:28,840
Don't say my name out loud
what if I have a kid eventually?

67
00:03:30,940 --> 00:03:33,270
Well... let's look at the picture then.

68
00:03:34,110 --> 00:03:36,010
Can-can you
drop the glasses already?

69
00:03:36,080 --> 00:03:37,080
What?

70
00:03:37,150 --> 00:03:38,350
They distract me.

71
00:03:38,410 --> 00:03:39,450
Are these weird?

72
00:03:39,510 --> 00:03:40,780
I always have these on.

73
00:03:40,850 --> 00:03:42,120
I showed them to you,
didn't I?

74
00:03:42,180 --> 00:03:43,450
I had them on for sure.

75
00:03:43,520 --> 00:03:44,820
What do you mean?

76
00:03:46,350 --> 00:03:48,360
What do you think?

77
00:03:50,120 --> 00:03:51,860
They look like a mosaic!

78
00:03:51,930 --> 00:03:53,090
A mosaic?

79
00:03:53,630 --> 00:03:54,500
Not at all.

80
00:03:54,560 --> 00:03:56,100
He always looks like this.

81
00:03:56,600 --> 00:03:57,800
Sorry...

82
00:03:57,870 --> 00:03:59,800
Take a good look.

83
00:04:02,000 --> 00:04:03,240
You're looking at me!

84
00:04:03,300 --> 00:04:04,310
I'm looking at him!

85
00:04:04,440 --> 00:04:05,610
Look at him.

86
00:04:05,670 --> 00:04:06,810
I am!

87
00:04:07,340 --> 00:04:08,940
Look at his mouth as well.

88
00:04:09,810 --> 00:04:10,810
What?

89
00:04:10,880 --> 00:04:11,910
What's wrong,
Jimmy-san?

90
00:04:11,980 --> 00:04:13,150
Look at his teeth now.

91
00:04:19,450 --> 00:04:20,460
He laughed.

92
00:04:20,560 --> 00:04:22,160
What's going on?

93
00:04:22,420 --> 00:04:24,730
Why did you do that then?

94
00:04:29,530 --> 00:04:31,600
You turned it on me!

95
00:04:32,100 --> 00:04:34,670
Even though
there were other funnier moments!

96
00:04:34,770 --> 00:04:36,000
What the hell?

97
00:04:38,710 --> 00:04:39,970
What are you doing?

98
00:04:40,070 --> 00:04:43,650
There were funnier moments.
What made you laugh?

99
00:04:43,710 --> 00:04:45,110
When he told me to see his teeth.

100
00:04:45,850 --> 00:04:47,220
I looked at them .

101
00:04:47,350 --> 00:04:49,080
So of course I laughed!

102
00:04:49,150 --> 00:04:51,920
Of course not!
You don't laugh with just some teeth!

103
00:04:51,990 --> 00:04:54,060
He was like "look at my teeth"!

104
00:04:54,260 --> 00:04:56,960
So Matsumoto-san,
maybe you already noticed,

105
00:04:57,030 --> 00:04:59,360
he laughed with that
the other time as well.

106
00:05:02,260 --> 00:05:03,800
For real?!
You suck at this!

107
00:05:04,170 --> 00:05:05,770
Let's put some pubes around the mouth.

108
00:05:06,170 --> 00:05:07,970
Who put
these pubes here?

109
00:05:08,270 --> 00:05:09,970
This is bad. Who was it?

110
00:05:10,100 --> 00:05:11,440
It's pretty bad, man!

111
00:05:11,510 --> 00:05:14,640
You can't put pubes
around your master's mouth!

112
00:05:14,810 --> 00:05:17,010
This is definitely
unacceptable, for sure!

113
00:05:17,350 --> 00:05:18,780
Huh? Kubota...

114
00:05:20,380 --> 00:05:22,880
Ready?
I wonder if I can

115
00:05:23,920 --> 00:05:27,520
do something like this
with Amazon?

116
00:05:32,160 --> 00:05:34,200
That's definitely
Matsuda Seiko!

117
00:05:34,830 --> 00:05:36,800
That's Matsuda Seiko!

118
00:05:38,630 --> 00:05:40,670
Besides, Kubota has
always had those glasses!

119
00:05:41,140 --> 00:05:42,370
These.

120
00:05:43,100 --> 00:05:45,370
Sometimes stuff backfires

121
00:05:45,670 --> 00:05:47,040
and I think I screwed up.

122
00:05:48,780 --> 00:05:50,240
I don't care...

123
00:05:51,010 --> 00:05:52,210
You're looking at me!

124
00:05:52,310 --> 00:05:53,310
I'm looking at him!

125
00:05:54,180 --> 00:05:55,750
I am!

126
00:05:56,320 --> 00:05:58,020
Look at his mouth as well.

127
00:05:58,690 --> 00:05:59,790
What?

128
00:05:59,890 --> 00:06:00,890
What's wrong, Jimmy-san?

129
00:06:00,960 --> 00:06:02,260
Look at his teeth.

130
00:06:06,530 --> 00:06:07,560
He laughed.

131
00:06:08,730 --> 00:06:10,600
You were smiling all along.

132
00:06:10,670 --> 00:06:13,770
I was thinking that
I should press the button anyway.

133
00:06:13,840 --> 00:06:14,800
Damn

134
00:06:16,440 --> 00:06:18,170
I'm starting to feel
bad as well.

135
00:06:20,940 --> 00:06:24,180
—That's too quick!
—That's too harsh!

136
00:06:30,650 --> 00:06:32,620
Alright, alright

137
00:06:32,750 --> 00:06:35,760
But you were smiling
at any random crap, man!

138
00:06:36,190 --> 00:06:37,230
I thought it was funny!

139
00:06:37,290 --> 00:06:39,490
So that's one point for Kubota.

140
00:06:40,360 --> 00:06:41,900
Alright, yellow.

141
00:06:42,560 --> 00:06:43,600
Kubota
hasn't done anything.

142
00:06:43,660 --> 00:06:45,000
I looked at his teeth!

143
00:06:45,200 --> 00:06:46,200
Teeth are normal!

144
00:06:46,270 --> 00:06:47,300
You have a gap.

145
00:06:47,370 --> 00:06:50,070
So when he first
showed them to me

146
00:06:50,140 --> 00:06:51,640
See? It's funny!

147
00:06:51,710 --> 00:06:53,040
What's funny about that?

148
00:06:53,610 --> 00:06:55,110
This isn't even the main act.

149
00:07:05,350 --> 00:07:06,350
The picture...

150
00:07:07,220 --> 00:07:08,760
I want to see!

151
00:07:09,720 --> 00:07:14,200
So I got a small envelope
with my address on it.

152
00:07:16,030 --> 00:07:17,230
And then

153
00:07:18,700 --> 00:07:19,770
What?

154
00:07:20,130 --> 00:07:21,900
Huh? Huh? (EN: 3)

155
00:07:22,170 --> 00:07:23,340
Whoa!

156
00:07:23,810 --> 00:07:24,810
For real?!

157
00:07:24,870 --> 00:07:25,940
That's creepy!

158
00:07:26,270 --> 00:07:28,540
I wanted the Special Defense Force to
open it for me.

159
00:07:29,210 --> 00:07:30,440
You haven't opened it?

160
00:07:30,510 --> 00:07:32,280
I did, eventually...

161
00:07:32,810 --> 00:07:33,950
So what was inside?

162
00:07:34,180 --> 00:07:35,880
Two thick books.

163
00:07:36,850 --> 00:07:39,090
Huh? Books?

164
00:07:40,420 --> 00:07:41,490
I can't say.

165
00:07:41,560 --> 00:07:42,720
Why?

166
00:07:42,790 --> 00:07:45,060
You read Pro Golfer Monkey recently? (EN: 4)

167
00:07:45,890 --> 00:07:46,990
Where?

168
00:07:47,400 --> 00:07:48,400
In the streets

169
00:07:48,460 --> 00:07:49,630
The streets?

170
00:07:54,340 --> 00:07:56,170
You like golf, right?

171
00:07:56,240 --> 00:07:57,670
You just burped, Inada?

172
00:07:57,810 --> 00:07:59,140
I did.

173
00:07:59,210 --> 00:08:00,410
Sorry, it's just that...

174
00:08:00,540 --> 00:08:02,910
Inada has been looking
out of it.

175
00:08:02,980 --> 00:08:04,480
Are you okay?

176
00:08:04,810 --> 00:08:08,950
I'm nervous, so I have some
phlegm in my throat.

177
00:08:09,420 --> 00:08:11,490
It's been stuck there
all this time.

178
00:08:11,620 --> 00:08:13,020
Why don't you
just let it all out?

179
00:08:13,090 --> 00:08:17,730
It's all stuck there
at the back like...

180
00:08:19,090 --> 00:08:21,460
What?
What was that, Koumoto-san?

181
00:08:21,900 --> 00:08:25,670
It's stuck at the back
so it won't just come out!

182
00:08:25,730 --> 00:08:27,840
Inada didn't say that.
What are you gonna do?

183
00:08:33,980 --> 00:08:35,880
What's that? Inada?

184
00:08:36,540 --> 00:08:37,550
For real?

185
00:08:37,610 --> 00:08:38,610
I didn't say that.

186
00:08:38,680 --> 00:08:40,350
Uh, yeah, sorry

187
00:08:41,350 --> 00:08:43,650
I got a new manager

188
00:08:43,750 --> 00:08:46,220
A guy named Maki from Yoshimoto.

189
00:08:46,450 --> 00:08:48,090
I know him, I know him!

190
00:08:48,160 --> 00:08:49,620
From Yuriyan...
Yeah, exactly!

191
00:08:51,790 --> 00:08:54,200
And Honoka-chan from a call-girl service. (Sex service)

192
00:08:54,330 --> 00:08:55,400
Huh? What?

193
00:08:55,460 --> 00:08:57,030
Honoka-chan from a call-girl service.

194
00:08:57,970 --> 00:08:59,270
Honoka-chan from a call-girl service.

195
00:08:59,370 --> 00:09:01,570
Honoka-chan?
I know her.

196
00:09:01,970 --> 00:09:02,970
She's that M girl, right?

197
00:09:03,040 --> 00:09:04,410
Yeah, yeah, yeah!

198
00:09:04,470 --> 00:09:05,470
How long does she take?

199
00:09:05,540 --> 00:09:06,740
90 minutes.

200
00:09:06,940 --> 00:09:08,310
How many orgasms?

201
00:09:08,380 --> 00:09:10,180
Around three or so.

202
00:09:10,340 --> 00:09:11,710
That's a lot, huh?

203
00:09:12,480 --> 00:09:13,610
One every 30 minutes?

204
00:09:13,680 --> 00:09:14,580
That's serious...

205
00:09:14,650 --> 00:09:15,950
Mine is also 90 minutes.

206
00:09:16,350 --> 00:09:17,490
How many times?

207
00:09:17,750 --> 00:09:18,990
Around 25.

208
00:09:19,090 --> 00:09:20,620
25?

209
00:09:20,860 --> 00:09:22,160
That's so much bullshit.

210
00:09:22,390 --> 00:09:24,290
You got the number wrong.

211
00:09:24,860 --> 00:09:27,060
Stop... lying, man.

212
00:09:27,130 --> 00:09:28,660
I'm sure it's just once.

213
00:09:32,900 --> 00:09:34,370
For real how many times?

214
00:09:34,440 --> 00:09:35,800
Just one.

215
00:09:37,270 --> 00:09:40,010
Don't order 90 minutes, okay?

216
00:09:41,280 --> 00:09:42,940
So the three times...

217
00:09:43,310 --> 00:09:44,410
The three times is for real.

218
00:09:44,480 --> 00:09:45,480
So she wrote a message.

219
00:09:45,550 --> 00:09:46,880
Yeah, right here.

220
00:09:47,480 --> 00:09:49,420
Onishi-san
thank you for today.

221
00:09:49,520 --> 00:09:50,920
It was really fun.

222
00:09:50,990 --> 00:09:54,060
Let's play together again.
I'm here on the weekends.

223
00:09:54,290 --> 00:09:55,660
She liked you?

224
00:09:56,060 --> 00:09:57,290
You hit it off?

225
00:09:57,790 --> 00:09:59,490
She means "play"
in private, right?

226
00:09:59,560 --> 00:10:01,530
No, she didn't give me
her number.

227
00:10:02,330 --> 00:10:03,360
There it is!

228
00:10:03,430 --> 00:10:05,500
This is just
the store's number.

229
00:10:05,570 --> 00:10:07,270
- Why don't you call?
- It's the store's number.

230
00:10:07,340 --> 00:10:08,370
Let's call right now.

231
00:10:08,440 --> 00:10:10,200
No, no!
That's the store's number!

232
00:10:10,270 --> 00:10:12,210
I haven't called yet!

233
00:10:12,740 --> 00:10:13,810
No, no, no!

234
00:10:14,680 --> 00:10:15,680
You should call.

235
00:10:16,780 --> 00:10:19,110
Uh... next is Shimbashi.

236
00:10:20,610 --> 00:10:22,420
Hayama-san.

237
00:10:23,380 --> 00:10:24,390
Hayama-san.

238
00:10:26,850 --> 00:10:29,060
Look! It's Hayama-san!

239
00:10:29,420 --> 00:10:32,590
Hayama-san from Shimbashi.

240
00:10:33,430 --> 00:10:34,430
That's a last name?

241
00:10:34,500 --> 00:10:35,960
Hayama-san from Shimbashi.

242
00:10:36,730 --> 00:10:37,900
That's a name?

243
00:10:37,970 --> 00:10:40,500
For real!
This is Hayama-san from Shimbashi.

244
00:10:43,100 --> 00:10:44,240
You used it?

245
00:10:45,870 --> 00:10:48,280
You used it right?
You did?

246
00:10:49,380 --> 00:10:52,080
You used the coupon?
I'm asking if you did.

247
00:10:52,280 --> 00:10:54,320
Did you use it, man?!

248
00:10:54,420 --> 00:10:55,820
What are you talking about?

249
00:10:55,880 --> 00:10:57,180
You used it, right?

250
00:10:58,190 --> 00:10:59,650
You used it?

251
00:10:59,890 --> 00:11:01,020
See?!

252
00:11:03,720 --> 00:11:05,130
What was that?

253
00:11:08,130 --> 00:11:09,630
I don't get this.

254
00:11:10,530 --> 00:11:12,270
This sucks.

255
00:11:16,740 --> 00:11:18,240
You shouldn't say that!

256
00:11:18,310 --> 00:11:20,470
What happened?

257
00:11:21,840 --> 00:11:23,280
You were so close.

258
00:11:23,810 --> 00:11:27,480
That was a long time ago
I was told to use it.

259
00:11:27,550 --> 00:11:31,650
It was a used discount coupon
that he gave to me...

260
00:11:31,720 --> 00:11:32,750
You have it here?

261
00:11:32,820 --> 00:11:34,760
You promised you wouldn't tell!

262
00:11:36,020 --> 00:11:38,590
You used the coupon?
I'm asking if you did.

263
00:11:38,960 --> 00:11:40,360
Did you use it, man?!

264
00:11:40,930 --> 00:11:42,400
What are you talking about?

265
00:11:42,460 --> 00:11:43,800
You used it, right?

266
00:11:44,830 --> 00:11:46,430
You used it?

267
00:11:46,500 --> 00:11:47,540
See?!

268
00:11:52,670 --> 00:11:56,210
You were too close though,
for real.

269
00:11:56,280 --> 00:11:58,680
Like Sigourney Weaver
with the alien.

270
00:11:58,750 --> 00:12:00,180
Too close!

271
00:12:01,280 --> 00:12:02,820
Breathing on his nose.

272
00:12:04,050 --> 00:12:05,920
Well, Koumoto did try
to hold it in.

273
00:12:06,090 --> 00:12:07,690
This is a yellow.

274
00:12:07,760 --> 00:12:08,920
That's rough!

275
00:12:08,990 --> 00:12:10,790
And a point for Jimmy-chan.

276
00:12:11,690 --> 00:12:14,930
He's pretty scary.
He came in strong today.

277
00:12:15,300 --> 00:12:16,330
He did.

278
00:12:16,530 --> 00:12:18,970
Also, what was that
30 minute thing, Nadal?

279
00:12:19,030 --> 00:12:23,170
For real...
I'm working on it.

280
00:12:23,240 --> 00:12:25,540
I've been failing
pretty hard so far.

281
00:12:27,480 --> 00:12:28,680
Hate to admit it, though.

282
00:12:28,740 --> 00:12:30,340
That hurts to say.

283
00:12:30,540 --> 00:12:31,910
You didn't have to!

284
00:12:38,490 --> 00:12:39,490
Here we go!

285
00:12:40,390 --> 00:12:42,720
That was close!

286
00:12:42,860 --> 00:12:43,890
It worked out.

287
00:12:43,960 --> 00:12:45,690
So was it an accident?

288
00:12:45,790 --> 00:12:49,900
You didn't know Koumoto-san was here
so it was by chance...

289
00:12:49,960 --> 00:12:51,270
I had it with me by chance.

290
00:12:51,330 --> 00:12:54,570
Because Jimmy didn't know
Koumoto would be here.

291
00:12:54,800 --> 00:12:57,540
- I think I got lucky today.
- You're good Jimmy-san.

292
00:12:58,040 --> 00:13:01,010
Not to mention he had
one and then another.

293
00:13:01,280 --> 00:13:03,840
And he called me over
right this way for it.

294
00:13:04,210 --> 00:13:07,280
I knew I had it with me,
I knew I did.

295
00:13:07,410 --> 00:13:08,680
Still talking about that?

296
00:13:08,750 --> 00:13:11,250
So wanna play the
tofu woodblock...

297
00:13:11,490 --> 00:13:12,720
The tofu woodblock game?

298
00:13:12,790 --> 00:13:13,790
Tofu woodblock game?

299
00:13:13,850 --> 00:13:14,820
What's that?

300
00:13:14,890 --> 00:13:17,090
You stack up tofu like this!

301
00:13:17,360 --> 00:13:18,730
Get a dish!

302
00:13:18,960 --> 00:13:20,160
It's already on the table!

303
00:13:20,230 --> 00:13:21,800
Are we gonna eat these later?

304
00:13:21,860 --> 00:13:23,460
I'll prepare miso later.

305
00:13:23,830 --> 00:13:24,930
Liar!

306
00:13:25,330 --> 00:13:26,830
I'll get some more.

307
00:13:26,900 --> 00:13:27,840
More tofu?

308
00:13:28,040 --> 00:13:29,570
It's not just this.

309
00:13:30,740 --> 00:13:33,770
Cut it
cut it in half, okay?

310
00:13:33,840 --> 00:13:36,480
- You have bad manners.
- The table's getting dirty!

311
00:13:37,410 --> 00:13:38,480
What manners?

312
00:13:38,550 --> 00:13:39,910
- What?
- No, no, no...

313
00:13:39,980 --> 00:13:41,380
- What's wrong?
- No, no, no... it's okay

314
00:13:41,920 --> 00:13:43,980
- Where are you going?
- Bad manners...

315
00:13:45,120 --> 00:13:48,590
The table's all sticky,
are there any wipes?

316
00:13:48,660 --> 00:13:49,820
What's wrong?

317
00:13:52,990 --> 00:13:55,560
The world is
all out of tapioca! (EN: 5)

318
00:13:55,630 --> 00:13:58,630
The world is
all out of tapioca!

319
00:13:59,600 --> 00:14:02,300
Out of tapioca
over the world!

320
00:14:02,370 --> 00:14:04,710
The world is out of

321
00:14:06,040 --> 00:14:08,640
The world is
all out of tapioca!

322
00:14:08,710 --> 00:14:12,210
There's no more tapioca
no more, oh no!

323
00:14:12,510 --> 00:14:15,150
The world is
all out of tapioca!

324
00:14:15,250 --> 00:14:16,280
Tapioca still exists...

325
00:14:16,350 --> 00:14:19,020
The world is
all out of tapioca

326
00:14:19,650 --> 00:14:21,360
We need tapioca.

327
00:14:22,090 --> 00:14:25,730
The world is all out of tapioca!
We're out of tapioca!

328
00:14:25,790 --> 00:14:27,630
We need tapioca!

329
00:14:27,700 --> 00:14:29,430
What's with those glasses?

330
00:14:29,930 --> 00:14:31,930
He's allergic?

331
00:14:32,670 --> 00:14:34,500
What do we do?

332
00:14:35,640 --> 00:14:37,370
I have withdrawal syndrome.

333
00:14:38,510 --> 00:14:39,870
You want to eat some?

334
00:14:40,170 --> 00:14:44,180
I can't stand it anymore!
I need stuff running up the straw!

335
00:14:44,410 --> 00:14:46,010
Bear with it!

336
00:14:46,710 --> 00:14:50,820
I can't stand it
if no balls are going up this straw!

337
00:14:50,880 --> 00:14:51,890
Withdrawal!

338
00:14:51,950 --> 00:14:55,590
We're out
we're out of tapioca!

339
00:14:55,760 --> 00:14:57,260
Wait, wait

340
00:14:58,460 --> 00:14:59,460
Does this work?

341
00:14:59,960 --> 00:15:02,100
As long as it goes up the straw.

342
00:15:02,160 --> 00:15:03,760
It won't though.

343
00:15:03,930 --> 00:15:05,970
The size is all wrong.

344
00:15:06,130 --> 00:15:07,100
It's soft.

345
00:15:07,170 --> 00:15:08,940
With a tapioca straw?

346
00:15:13,870 --> 00:15:15,840
There it is!
It's working?

347
00:15:17,310 --> 00:15:18,910
Ouch!

348
00:15:18,910 --> 00:15:20,710
Whoa... that's something!

349
00:15:21,120 --> 00:15:22,950
Ouch!

350
00:15:23,020 --> 00:15:26,190
It won't go up the straw!
I need something bouncy!

351
00:15:26,250 --> 00:15:28,090
We're out of tapioca!

352
00:15:28,760 --> 00:15:30,620
We're out of tapioca!

353
00:15:30,690 --> 00:15:32,830
What-what what about this?

354
00:15:32,990 --> 00:15:35,900
I think we...
we had some tapioca!

355
00:15:35,960 --> 00:15:38,430
You have tapioca?
I need something bouncy!

356
00:15:38,630 --> 00:15:40,730
Anything works,
if it goes up the straw.

357
00:15:41,300 --> 00:15:42,340
Here you go.

358
00:15:42,770 --> 00:15:43,870
You're hairy.

359
00:15:43,970 --> 00:15:45,440
I have some tapioca.

360
00:15:45,840 --> 00:15:46,970
Thank you so much.

361
00:15:53,710 --> 00:15:54,720
That stinks!

362
00:15:55,780 --> 00:15:57,580
What's wrong?
It stinks!

363
00:15:58,750 --> 00:15:59,750
The tapioca?

364
00:16:00,190 --> 00:16:01,220
It stinks!

365
00:16:02,490 --> 00:16:03,520
It stinks, yeah.

366
00:16:06,560 --> 00:16:08,860
- Ouch.
- That stinks!

367
00:16:14,230 --> 00:16:15,340
It's so stinky?

368
00:16:15,600 --> 00:16:17,200
I want to touch.

369
00:16:17,600 --> 00:16:18,970
No, don't worry, Ikko-san.

370
00:16:19,040 --> 00:16:20,370
Are you going to stay as Ikko?

371
00:16:20,440 --> 00:16:21,610
What?

372
00:16:21,780 --> 00:16:23,340
No, just wondering if you are.

373
00:16:23,410 --> 00:16:25,510
What? Who are you?

374
00:16:26,150 --> 00:16:27,410
I'm Cookie.

375
00:16:28,250 --> 00:16:29,320
I'm Ikko.

376
00:16:31,220 --> 00:16:32,790
What's that?
Balls.

377
00:16:32,850 --> 00:16:33,790
Can I touch them?

378
00:16:34,120 --> 00:16:37,120
I don't really recommend it
but feel free to do so.

379
00:16:37,190 --> 00:16:38,730
I want to give it a try.

380
00:16:41,600 --> 00:16:42,700
There we go.

381
00:16:43,200 --> 00:16:44,770
Fluffy!!!

382
00:16:54,240 --> 00:16:56,140
Don't you have any tapioca,
Jimmy-san?

383
00:16:56,640 --> 00:16:58,080
I have some.

384
00:16:58,650 --> 00:17:00,010
Would my tapioca work?

385
00:17:00,510 --> 00:17:01,520
Yes.

386
00:17:01,750 --> 00:17:02,750
Mine?

387
00:17:02,820 --> 00:17:04,220
My-My tapioca

388
00:17:04,280 --> 00:17:05,250
It's prettier than expected.

389
00:17:05,320 --> 00:17:06,650
For real.

390
00:17:07,420 --> 00:17:08,820
I got a vasectomy.

391
00:17:09,260 --> 00:17:10,320
Huh?

392
00:17:10,960 --> 00:17:12,230
Really?

393
00:17:12,530 --> 00:17:15,030
Was it expensive?

394
00:17:15,500 --> 00:17:16,560
Around 300k yen.

395
00:17:16,630 --> 00:17:17,530
That's expensive!

396
00:17:19,230 --> 00:17:20,670
I didn't think the insurance
would cover it.

397
00:17:20,730 --> 00:17:21,770
Of course.

398
00:17:26,070 --> 00:17:28,010
Come on!

399
00:17:28,280 --> 00:17:29,380
Ikko-san,
are you okay with this?

400
00:17:29,440 --> 00:17:31,280
Okay? Okay?

401
00:17:31,750 --> 00:17:32,950
I'll touch it.

402
00:17:34,380 --> 00:17:35,850
So pretty...

403
00:17:41,290 --> 00:17:42,420
Huh?

404
00:17:49,200 --> 00:17:50,900
Ikko-san is touching him.

405
00:17:51,030 --> 00:17:52,230
No way...

406
00:17:53,670 --> 00:17:55,900
How much?!

407
00:17:56,000 --> 00:17:58,140
Okay, okay, that's that.

408
00:17:59,970 --> 00:18:02,010
"How much?" For real?

409
00:18:03,640 --> 00:18:04,780
Ah, sorry.

410
00:18:07,820 --> 00:18:08,820
What happened to you?

411
00:18:08,920 --> 00:18:09,980
That's a big wound.

412
00:18:10,050 --> 00:18:11,320
I've been sick.

413
00:18:11,650 --> 00:18:14,290
No way, man.
Sick?

414
00:18:17,390 --> 00:18:19,790
You wrap a bandage
around your rooster when you get sick?

415
00:18:19,860 --> 00:18:20,990
Just call it a dick.

416
00:18:21,500 --> 00:18:22,760
Rooster?

417
00:18:25,530 --> 00:18:27,030
Okay, take care.

418
00:18:27,100 --> 00:18:28,100
What about the tofu?

419
00:18:28,170 --> 00:18:30,200
Let's play the tofu woodblock game!

420
00:18:30,270 --> 00:18:31,870
The tofu woodblock game?

421
00:18:31,940 --> 00:18:33,410
Wash your hands.

422
00:18:34,880 --> 00:18:36,980
If you lose,
you have to get in here.

423
00:18:37,040 --> 00:18:38,080
Where?

424
00:18:38,350 --> 00:18:39,510
The pool?

425
00:18:39,580 --> 00:18:40,510
If we lose?

426
00:18:40,610 --> 00:18:41,820
If it falls, yeah.

427
00:18:42,280 --> 00:18:43,280
It falls?

428
00:18:43,350 --> 00:18:44,790
If the tofu falls.

429
00:18:44,850 --> 00:18:46,290
If the tofu falls? Okay

430
00:18:46,550 --> 00:18:47,890
I don't really care about this.

431
00:18:47,960 --> 00:18:50,390
Why are you all running away?
What about the tofu?

432
00:18:50,460 --> 00:18:53,160
Well, you're washing your hands, so

433
00:18:53,460 --> 00:18:54,430
I don't have a towel.

434
00:18:55,030 --> 00:18:56,100
I have one!

435
00:18:57,230 --> 00:18:58,770
Do we need that much tofu?

436
00:18:58,830 --> 00:19:01,300
I think we can all carry a lot.

437
00:19:01,700 --> 00:19:02,800
We can carry a lot.

438
00:19:02,870 --> 00:19:04,740
- So it's kind of like jenga?
- What's jenda?

439
00:19:05,240 --> 00:19:06,440
- What's jenda?
- Jenga.

440
00:19:06,570 --> 00:19:07,740
What's jenga?

441
00:19:08,380 --> 00:19:09,810
You have a jenga right there.

442
00:19:09,880 --> 00:19:11,650
Hamada-san has been...

443
00:19:11,710 --> 00:19:13,550
- Jenga?
- A jenga.

444
00:19:15,080 --> 00:19:16,650
With this, you lose if
You lost!

445
00:19:17,450 --> 00:19:20,420
- You lost, you lost!
- No, no, no!

446
00:19:20,490 --> 00:19:22,820
We haven't even said
"tofu game yay!"

447
00:19:22,890 --> 00:19:24,290
- You lost, you lost.
- We didn't say it!

448
00:19:25,430 --> 00:19:26,660
We haven't

449
00:19:26,730 --> 00:19:30,300
But doing this is
practically impossible.

450
00:19:30,360 --> 00:19:32,130
No, this is
totally impossible.

451
00:19:34,200 --> 00:19:35,200
There's no way.

452
00:19:35,370 --> 00:19:36,540
A blade...

453
00:19:36,670 --> 00:19:37,770
Watch out, watch out!

454
00:19:37,840 --> 00:19:39,040
Wait, wait
I'm cutting in half!

455
00:19:39,110 --> 00:19:40,470
Watch out for wounds...

456
00:19:41,510 --> 00:19:43,880
It's all a mess, man...

457
00:19:43,940 --> 00:19:45,710
Cut them in half.

458
00:19:47,920 --> 00:19:49,420
What about the money?

459
00:19:49,480 --> 00:19:51,350
Okay everyone!
Tofu woodblock game yay!

460
00:19:52,320 --> 00:19:53,620
We have to put them
on that place, right?

461
00:19:53,690 --> 00:19:55,420
On this plate, yeah.

462
00:19:56,820 --> 00:19:57,890
Take the lead.

463
00:19:57,960 --> 00:19:58,930
Who should start?

464
00:19:58,990 --> 00:20:00,090
What should I say?

465
00:20:00,460 --> 00:20:01,660
Toshiba

466
00:20:02,500 --> 00:20:04,570
- Toshiba?
- Toshiba....?

467
00:20:04,970 --> 00:20:06,370
Tofu spinning game

468
00:20:06,470 --> 00:20:07,730
Spinning game?

469
00:20:08,300 --> 00:20:09,900
Tofu woodblock game.

470
00:20:10,240 --> 00:20:14,510
We have to synchronize the yay at
tofu woodblock game yay!

471
00:20:15,410 --> 00:20:16,480
With the right hand?

472
00:20:16,780 --> 00:20:18,150
Tofu woodblock game!

473
00:20:18,580 --> 00:20:19,610
Yay!

474
00:20:21,680 --> 00:20:24,590
Clap clap! I go first.

475
00:20:25,520 --> 00:20:26,520
Clap clap!

476
00:20:27,390 --> 00:20:29,220
I go first

477
00:20:29,390 --> 00:20:31,090
We go around like that.

478
00:20:31,260 --> 00:20:32,260
Normally

479
00:20:32,390 --> 00:20:33,290
Clockwise.

480
00:20:36,400 --> 00:20:37,800
No, man! Stack it on top!

481
00:20:39,000 --> 00:20:40,000
No way!

482
00:20:40,070 --> 00:20:41,500
It's impossible!

483
00:20:41,570 --> 00:20:43,540
Did you think this through?

484
00:20:43,670 --> 00:20:45,310
Go back home!

485
00:20:45,670 --> 00:20:48,580
I don't get it.
One, two...

486
00:20:48,640 --> 00:20:50,080
Investment spinning game. Yay

487
00:20:50,140 --> 00:20:51,140
Investment spinning?

488
00:20:51,210 --> 00:20:52,680
Tofu spinning game

489
00:20:52,980 --> 00:20:54,280
Wasn't it woodblock?

490
00:20:54,780 --> 00:20:56,450
No, they're not woodblocks!
This is tofu!

491
00:20:56,720 --> 00:20:57,920
You said woodblock game!

492
00:20:57,990 --> 00:21:01,190
Tofu woodblock game
Tofu woodblock game yay!

493
00:21:03,590 --> 00:21:04,590
We clap at the yay?

494
00:21:04,660 --> 00:21:09,760
Right. Tofu woodblock game yay!
Clap clap yay!

495
00:21:10,000 --> 00:21:11,000
On top?

496
00:21:11,060 --> 00:21:12,800
What about the "me first"?

497
00:21:12,870 --> 00:21:14,740
One from me.

498
00:21:16,770 --> 00:21:18,410
One from me.

499
00:21:18,710 --> 00:21:20,740
One from Koba-san.

500
00:21:22,140 --> 00:21:23,680
One from Koba-san.

501
00:21:23,740 --> 00:21:25,310
One from Cookie!

502
00:21:26,050 --> 00:21:27,550
That's close! This is bad!

503
00:21:27,610 --> 00:21:29,020
Damn it!

504
00:21:29,080 --> 00:21:30,550
They're poorly cut.

505
00:21:30,620 --> 00:21:32,520
- On top?
- No...

506
00:21:33,120 --> 00:21:34,550
Huh?!
Can he put it next to it?

507
00:21:34,660 --> 00:21:35,990
They're woodblocks, yeah.

508
00:21:36,790 --> 00:21:41,660
On top on top on top on top!

509
00:21:41,800 --> 00:21:43,460
Why not just next to it?

510
00:21:43,530 --> 00:21:44,670
We'll lose right away!

511
00:21:44,730 --> 00:21:45,770
We'll lose.

512
00:21:45,930 --> 00:21:46,930
Not everyone will go.

513
00:21:47,000 --> 00:21:48,600
Okay, let's do that.

514
00:21:48,670 --> 00:21:50,340
- Where?
- Next to it!

515
00:21:50,470 --> 00:21:53,640
You should be on house arrest
until you're 90, man!

516
00:21:53,710 --> 00:21:55,040
I don't understand "90"

517
00:21:55,110 --> 00:21:56,580
Why?!

518
00:21:56,880 --> 00:21:58,780
- 90, right?
- 90 years old.

519
00:21:59,850 --> 00:22:01,480
No, no,
wait a second.

520
00:22:02,280 --> 00:22:03,650
You touched it!

521
00:22:03,720 --> 00:22:05,390
- That's the one from cookie!
- Right!

522
00:22:05,450 --> 00:22:08,520
- It's still on the place, so it's fine!
- You have to get in.

523
00:22:08,820 --> 00:22:12,330
- I don't want to.
- You have to!

524
00:22:12,990 --> 00:22:14,130
Ouch!

525
00:22:15,630 --> 00:22:18,330
Come on!
Don't do that!

526
00:22:18,670 --> 00:22:20,070
You have to get in!

527
00:22:20,230 --> 00:22:21,540
It's still on top so it's fine!

528
00:22:21,800 --> 00:22:25,140
That's no good!
This is a woodblock game!

529
00:22:27,110 --> 00:22:28,110
Get in.

530
00:22:34,350 --> 00:22:36,480
That's too cold!

531
00:22:36,550 --> 00:22:37,780
That's the rules.
It's a woodblock game.

532
00:22:38,090 --> 00:22:39,820
I've never heard
of anything like that!

533
00:22:40,190 --> 00:22:44,560
You prepared it, did what you wanted
and now pour ice as you please?!

534
00:22:44,660 --> 00:22:47,930
- That was just a test, right?
- That's how these games go.

535
00:22:47,990 --> 00:22:49,230
So let's do this one for real.

536
00:22:49,300 --> 00:22:51,430
Let's do this one for real.

537
00:22:51,700 --> 00:22:53,770
Ah, watch out!

538
00:22:53,930 --> 00:22:55,140
That's a boulder!

539
00:22:55,570 --> 00:22:57,140
—Boulder?
—A boulder of ice?

540
00:22:58,170 --> 00:22:59,910
That looks cold.

541
00:23:00,710 --> 00:23:02,080
This is kinda...

542
00:23:02,140 --> 00:23:04,210
Is it just the feet?

543
00:23:04,310 --> 00:23:05,810
—No uh...
—Full body?

544
00:23:05,880 --> 00:23:08,780
Well yeah...
without the mic of course.

545
00:23:10,550 --> 00:23:12,090
Can we take off our clothes?

546
00:23:12,190 --> 00:23:13,250
Can we leave them on?

547
00:23:13,320 --> 00:23:14,860
Do what you want.

548
00:23:14,920 --> 00:23:17,490
I think they'll be
really cold, though.

549
00:23:19,890 --> 00:23:20,890
We going there?

550
00:23:20,960 --> 00:23:22,160
You ready for that?

551
00:23:22,230 --> 00:23:24,900
This is too harsh, man!

552
00:23:25,130 --> 00:23:28,270
So if the tofu crumbles
we have to go in there?

553
00:23:28,640 --> 00:23:29,640
That's that.

554
00:23:29,700 --> 00:23:31,170
That's too much, right?

555
00:23:31,810 --> 00:23:35,280
You go in,
and use this to pour more.

556
00:23:35,880 --> 00:23:37,840
That's too cold, man!

557
00:23:38,610 --> 00:23:40,110
We have to take the mic off.

558
00:23:40,980 --> 00:23:45,390
You use this, get in
and then pour...

559
00:23:47,790 --> 00:23:48,790
You went in.

560
00:23:48,860 --> 00:23:50,790
I did, but, well...

561
00:23:51,190 --> 00:23:52,730
Is it really cold?

562
00:23:52,860 --> 00:23:54,030
I think it is.

563
00:23:54,090 --> 00:23:55,960
What a mess of a game.

564
00:23:56,960 --> 00:23:58,370
Why don't you take off
that cape?

565
00:23:58,430 --> 00:24:00,530
Take off the cape.

566
00:24:01,800 --> 00:24:03,000
This is too much.

567
00:24:03,070 --> 00:24:04,570
Take this.

568
00:24:04,910 --> 00:24:05,940
That stinks!

569
00:24:08,210 --> 00:24:09,880
You just laughed right now!

570
00:24:10,540 --> 00:24:12,210
You just laughed!

571
00:24:13,910 --> 00:24:15,520
No one saw it?

572
00:24:18,080 --> 00:24:19,520
He smelled.

573
00:24:22,220 --> 00:24:23,290
And then laughed.

574
00:24:23,360 --> 00:24:25,160
You even laughed out loud.

575
00:24:25,590 --> 00:24:27,290
I don't get what makes you laugh.

576
00:24:27,460 --> 00:24:28,560
You suck at this!

577
00:24:28,630 --> 00:24:30,230
What makes him laugh?

578
00:24:30,500 --> 00:24:32,170
I didn't see that coming.

579
00:24:32,600 --> 00:24:34,300
He just laughed, right?

580
00:24:34,870 --> 00:24:37,070
He laughed normally.

581
00:24:37,470 --> 00:24:38,540
Let's take a look.

582
00:24:39,610 --> 00:24:41,680
It was far too natural

583
00:24:41,740 --> 00:24:43,310
and it's not like
you don't know the rules.

584
00:24:43,380 --> 00:24:45,910
He laughed like he
didn't know them.

585
00:24:47,180 --> 00:24:48,880
What a mess of a game.

586
00:24:50,020 --> 00:24:51,380
Why don't you take off
that cape?

587
00:24:51,480 --> 00:24:53,720
Take off the cape.

588
00:24:54,890 --> 00:24:55,960
This is too much.

589
00:24:56,120 --> 00:24:57,690
Take this.

590
00:24:58,090 --> 00:24:59,130
That stinks!

591
00:25:04,630 --> 00:25:07,170
What happened?
What was so funny?

592
00:25:07,230 --> 00:25:10,170
No, I was just off guard,
let me off the hook!

593
00:25:10,400 --> 00:25:11,640
What's your deal?
For real!

594
00:25:11,710 --> 00:25:13,510
Just let me off the hook!

595
00:25:15,380 --> 00:25:17,010
Alright, here we go.

596
00:25:18,380 --> 00:25:19,750
That's the second one.

597
00:25:19,810 --> 00:25:23,350
But you have to do it at least once
that tofu thing

598
00:25:23,420 --> 00:25:24,580
The woodblock?

599
00:25:24,850 --> 00:25:26,250
I'll do it properly.

600
00:25:26,820 --> 00:25:29,460
And they're all stacked

601
00:25:29,520 --> 00:25:31,160
so I don't know which
the main one is.

602
00:25:31,220 --> 00:25:32,890
The first one.

603
00:25:36,500 --> 00:25:38,430
They're stacked
as a default setting.

604
00:25:39,730 --> 00:25:43,370
Give it a try,
do it properly.

605
00:25:43,440 --> 00:25:45,140
Because this is getting annoying.

606
00:25:46,110 --> 00:25:47,470
Let's start again.

607
00:25:47,870 --> 00:25:49,340
Do it once.

608
00:25:49,840 --> 00:25:51,850
Wanna use some kitchen paper?

609
00:25:53,280 --> 00:25:55,720
If you do this...

610
00:25:57,720 --> 00:25:59,050
That works.

611
00:26:00,550 --> 00:26:04,020
The first time was fine, though.

612
00:26:05,230 --> 00:26:07,260
Yeah, I thought
cutting them was a bad idea.

613
00:26:07,330 --> 00:26:08,960
Now we have this much.

614
00:26:09,030 --> 00:26:10,400
I see...

615
00:26:12,070 --> 00:26:14,170
Why are you looking
so deflated?!

616
00:26:14,230 --> 00:26:16,200
He's also
really pissed off right now!

617
00:26:16,940 --> 00:26:20,370
I'm the same as always,
I was just thinking.

618
00:26:20,470 --> 00:26:22,180
You're so depressed!

619
00:26:23,580 --> 00:26:24,710
Wait!

620
00:26:25,480 --> 00:26:27,650
Stop trying to
bring me down!

621
00:26:27,880 --> 00:26:29,850
No, no
no one's doing that!

622
00:26:29,920 --> 00:26:31,250
You're self destructing!

623
00:26:36,190 --> 00:26:37,220
Alright, let's go!

624
00:26:38,730 --> 00:26:39,730
Like Matsumoto-san said

625
00:26:39,790 --> 00:26:41,700
this is too unstable,
let's do this.

626
00:26:41,930 --> 00:26:42,930
Huh? Why?

627
00:26:43,000 --> 00:26:45,130
It'll be hard to stack them.

628
00:26:45,570 --> 00:26:47,270
That's the point
of the game.

629
00:26:47,330 --> 00:26:49,270
Is that size okay?

630
00:26:50,140 --> 00:26:52,110
Wait wait,
stack them right...

631
00:26:54,470 --> 00:26:55,780
Wanna give it a try?
Ready?

632
00:26:56,180 --> 00:26:59,150
They're unstable cut like that
so maybe this...

633
00:26:59,380 --> 00:27:02,480
Tofu yay yay,
tofu yay yay

634
00:27:02,550 --> 00:27:03,620
That's not it.

635
00:27:03,680 --> 00:27:05,390
What's that "tofu yay yay" bullshit?

636
00:27:05,450 --> 00:27:06,650
One yay too many.

637
00:27:08,860 --> 00:27:10,360
I go next.

638
00:27:11,620 --> 00:27:13,060
Like a demonstration?

639
00:27:13,490 --> 00:27:14,490
Between them?

640
00:27:14,560 --> 00:27:16,730
No, no, no.
We're all doing it.

641
00:27:16,960 --> 00:27:18,870
With these new rules?

642
00:27:18,970 --> 00:27:20,470
That was Nadal's test, right?

643
00:27:20,900 --> 00:27:23,540
No, I think this won't work.
Let's do it like this.

644
00:27:23,600 --> 00:27:24,800
That's too hard to stack.

645
00:27:25,110 --> 00:27:26,810
That's fine, though!

646
00:27:28,110 --> 00:27:29,540
Let's do it once.

647
00:27:30,240 --> 00:27:31,610
Tofu woodblock game yay!

648
00:27:31,680 --> 00:27:32,780
Yay!

649
00:27:34,010 --> 00:27:36,080
Jimmy clap clap!

650
00:27:36,750 --> 00:27:38,890
You say your name?
I don't remember the name.

651
00:27:38,950 --> 00:27:40,120
Kobayashi

652
00:27:41,790 --> 00:27:43,920
This is more stable, so...

653
00:27:43,990 --> 00:27:45,130
You have to say your name

654
00:27:45,190 --> 00:27:46,790
We should use bigger ones.

655
00:27:47,130 --> 00:27:49,230
I'll do it like this.

656
00:27:50,060 --> 00:27:51,100
Cookie!

657
00:27:53,500 --> 00:27:57,640
I guess I'll use this one.
And make another foundation.

658
00:27:57,770 --> 00:27:58,870
So gentle.

659
00:28:00,970 --> 00:28:02,240
This looks bad!

660
00:28:02,310 --> 00:28:03,680
That's dangerous!

661
00:28:03,740 --> 00:28:04,940
Akiyama!

662
00:28:06,480 --> 00:28:07,780
This is bad!

663
00:28:09,480 --> 00:28:10,680
I can choose anything?

664
00:28:10,750 --> 00:28:11,850
Even a tiny one, yeah!

665
00:28:12,090 --> 00:28:14,450
As long as it's there,
anything goes!

666
00:28:14,890 --> 00:28:15,560
Whichever's fine.

667
00:28:15,620 --> 00:28:16,960
Watch out!

668
00:28:17,160 --> 00:28:18,260
Watch out!!

669
00:28:18,490 --> 00:28:19,590
This one?

670
00:28:20,130 --> 00:28:21,130
Wait a second-

671
00:28:21,590 --> 00:28:22,700
Akiyama-san?

672
00:28:23,360 --> 00:28:24,700
No, that's my fault?

673
00:28:25,430 --> 00:28:26,500
That was Akiyama's

674
00:28:26,570 --> 00:28:28,840
No, that'll happen
if we stand around chatting.

675
00:28:28,900 --> 00:28:30,040
Okay, Akiyama.

676
00:28:30,440 --> 00:28:31,970
Of course not!

677
00:28:32,040 --> 00:28:34,710
I mean, you moved the table
with your dick right now!

678
00:28:34,770 --> 00:28:36,110
That was Akiyama's

679
00:28:36,340 --> 00:28:37,840
That was Akiyama's yeah.

680
00:28:37,910 --> 00:28:41,650
We need to decide a time limit
because it collapses with time.

681
00:28:41,710 --> 00:28:43,550
Like just after stacking yours?

682
00:28:43,620 --> 00:28:45,720
Yeah, right.
Otherwise we'll just talk and it'll fall.

683
00:28:45,790 --> 00:28:48,490
That's so,
because tofu is soft.

684
00:28:48,560 --> 00:28:50,320
I kinda get
what he means, though.

685
00:28:50,390 --> 00:28:51,520
I do too

686
00:28:52,430 --> 00:28:55,260
Okay, choose a time span, Nadal.

687
00:28:55,760 --> 00:28:57,200
Alright. Ten seconds?

688
00:28:57,400 --> 00:28:59,400
Ten seconds between what and what?

689
00:28:59,470 --> 00:29:00,770
What's the limit?

690
00:29:01,670 --> 00:29:02,800
Why not two seconds?

691
00:29:02,870 --> 00:29:04,340
Let's do ten.

692
00:29:04,640 --> 00:29:07,870
It's your game!
You should choose!

693
00:29:09,140 --> 00:29:10,140
Bang bang and three seconds.

694
00:29:10,210 --> 00:29:11,340
Sorry

695
00:29:13,350 --> 00:29:14,810
—Bang bang and
- Sorry.

696
00:29:14,880 --> 00:29:17,480
Bang bang?
Wasn't it clap clap?

697
00:29:18,250 --> 00:29:19,950
What's going on?!

698
00:29:20,250 --> 00:29:23,190
We need to
unify the chanting as well.

699
00:29:25,590 --> 00:29:27,690
If we get anything wrong
Jimmy-san goes in.

700
00:29:27,760 --> 00:29:29,200
Let's do that!

701
00:29:30,360 --> 00:29:32,670
The rules are all messed up
so Jimmy goes in.

702
00:29:32,730 --> 00:29:34,530
That's too cruel, man!

703
00:29:36,200 --> 00:29:37,770
Alright, five seconds then.

704
00:29:38,610 --> 00:29:39,740
Who starts?

705
00:29:39,810 --> 00:29:41,170
Let's go with Kubota.

706
00:29:41,910 --> 00:29:43,540
Just go with the chant.

707
00:29:44,180 --> 00:29:45,110
Let's go

708
00:29:45,410 --> 00:29:48,310
Tofu woodblock game yay!

709
00:29:49,520 --> 00:29:50,580
First tofu

710
00:29:50,780 --> 00:29:52,590
Ah, Kubota, you're out.

711
00:29:54,020 --> 00:29:55,690
You have to say your name.

712
00:29:55,760 --> 00:29:56,760
My name?

713
00:29:56,860 --> 00:29:58,390
You didn't say it.

714
00:29:58,490 --> 00:30:00,660
So if you don't say your name
you're out?

715
00:30:00,730 --> 00:30:02,760
You have to say it.

716
00:30:02,930 --> 00:30:04,130
I'm gonna cry.

717
00:30:05,060 --> 00:30:06,200
Maybe I should kill you

718
00:30:06,300 --> 00:30:07,630
Huh?

719
00:30:08,600 --> 00:30:10,200
—Kill...?
—Let's go again.

720
00:30:10,470 --> 00:30:11,640
That's good.

721
00:30:12,370 --> 00:30:13,570
Ah, shut up man.

722
00:30:15,980 --> 00:30:16,940
You were gonna kill him?

723
00:30:17,010 --> 00:30:18,610
Let's go

724
00:30:19,710 --> 00:30:20,910
I'll kill you...

725
00:30:23,150 --> 00:30:24,550
He's kinda...

726
00:30:24,620 --> 00:30:26,390
I haven't said anything!

727
00:30:26,490 --> 00:30:28,760
Get serious already
I didn't say anything man!

728
00:30:28,860 --> 00:30:30,190
—Did he say something?
—Yeah.

729
00:30:30,260 --> 00:30:31,360
It stinks!

730
00:30:33,060 --> 00:30:34,190
"Tochu"...

731
00:30:36,400 --> 00:30:37,960
So I have to start, right?

732
00:30:38,200 --> 00:30:39,800
Shut up, man.

733
00:30:39,870 --> 00:30:40,870
What's "tochu"?

734
00:30:40,930 --> 00:30:42,970
Aren't you out
JImmy-san?

735
00:30:43,040 --> 00:30:44,640
You said "tochu", didn't you?

736
00:30:45,340 --> 00:30:46,670
Okay, out!

737
00:30:47,640 --> 00:30:48,880
So I'm out?

738
00:30:48,940 --> 00:30:50,280
Let's get in.

739
00:30:50,910 --> 00:30:52,250
You okay, Jimmy-san?

740
00:30:52,310 --> 00:30:53,810
You should pump up your heartbeat first.

741
00:30:53,880 --> 00:30:55,680
Watch out, watch out!

742
00:30:56,020 --> 00:30:59,290
- Come on!
- This is bad!

743
00:31:01,720 --> 00:31:03,620
That's scary!

744
00:31:03,960 --> 00:31:05,020
Go on, go on!

745
00:31:05,090 --> 00:31:06,430
You go this deep

746
00:31:07,130 --> 00:31:08,360
What?!

747
00:31:11,760 --> 00:31:13,570
Watch out, watch out!

748
00:31:15,540 --> 00:31:16,600
Thank you

749
00:31:17,670 --> 00:31:18,470
Thank you

750
00:31:19,170 --> 00:31:20,170
Thank you

751
00:31:21,140 --> 00:31:22,880
That's how it is.

752
00:31:25,710 --> 00:31:26,980
Thank you, Kubota

753
00:31:29,620 --> 00:31:31,320
Sorry, for real

754
00:31:31,580 --> 00:31:33,790
Thanks for showing me
how kind you can be.

755
00:31:33,850 --> 00:31:35,390
You should get closer

756
00:31:35,520 --> 00:31:36,560
Thank you, man!

757
00:31:36,620 --> 00:31:37,590
Thank you too

758
00:31:37,660 --> 00:31:38,860
Don't get so close!

759
00:31:39,230 --> 00:31:40,730
Don't get close, I'll kill you!

760
00:31:40,790 --> 00:31:42,960
I'm thanking you,
sorry for everything!

761
00:31:43,660 --> 00:31:44,700
Sorry

762
00:31:44,760 --> 00:31:46,500
Don't get closer
I'll kill you for real

763
00:31:46,570 --> 00:31:47,570
For real, thank you

764
00:31:47,630 --> 00:31:50,040
I'm gonna kill him
sorry, here I go

765
00:31:50,140 --> 00:31:51,140
Ouch!

766
00:31:53,570 --> 00:31:55,170
That's hot!

767
00:31:55,740 --> 00:31:57,310
That's hot!

768
00:31:59,910 --> 00:32:00,910
Who was it?

769
00:32:00,980 --> 00:32:02,180
Nadal, right?

770
00:32:02,520 --> 00:32:04,920
Damn it!
I haven't even done anything!

771
00:32:06,920 --> 00:32:07,820
It was hot?

772
00:32:07,950 --> 00:32:09,460
That was too hot!

773
00:32:12,860 --> 00:32:13,990
Come on,
that's too much!

774
00:32:14,060 --> 00:32:16,000
It really is,
damn it!

775
00:32:18,230 --> 00:32:19,430
That was weird.

776
00:32:19,500 --> 00:32:20,800
When did it happen?

777
00:32:20,870 --> 00:32:22,400
It was weird.

778
00:32:23,200 --> 00:32:25,370
What's the big idea?

779
00:32:26,740 --> 00:32:28,740
- Nadal!
- So it was me after all?!

780
00:32:33,250 --> 00:32:34,310
Don't get closer!

781
00:32:34,810 --> 00:32:36,150
Don't get closer,
I'll kill you!

782
00:32:36,420 --> 00:32:38,580
I'm thanking you,
sorry for everything!

783
00:32:39,250 --> 00:32:40,290
Sorry

784
00:32:40,350 --> 00:32:42,160
Don't get closer,
I'll kill you for real

785
00:32:42,220 --> 00:32:43,190
Sorry, really

786
00:32:43,260 --> 00:32:45,590
I'm gonna kill him
sorry, here I go

787
00:32:45,790 --> 00:32:46,790
Ouch!

788
00:32:49,200 --> 00:32:50,760
That's hot!

789
00:32:54,970 --> 00:32:56,870
Hot?! How is that hot?!

790
00:32:57,100 --> 00:32:58,870
That gets hot?!
It does!

791
00:32:58,940 --> 00:33:00,610
There's no way!

792
00:33:01,610 --> 00:33:02,980
That's hot?
It is!

793
00:33:03,040 --> 00:33:04,140
Gunpowder's hot

794
00:33:04,210 --> 00:33:06,250
Jimmy-san's reactions
are always so...

795
00:33:06,310 --> 00:33:07,580
I feel like he'd call anything hot.

796
00:33:07,650 --> 00:33:09,880
So I thought he was saying
some nonsense.

797
00:33:09,950 --> 00:33:10,920
You're right.

798
00:33:11,350 --> 00:33:13,720
It's what it is.

799
00:33:15,150 --> 00:33:18,660
Well, I guess...
you could stop or keep going.

800
00:33:18,890 --> 00:33:21,130
Let's get one round done!

801
00:33:21,190 --> 00:33:22,260
Let's get serious!

802
00:33:22,330 --> 00:33:24,460
At least until he's still here!

803
00:33:24,530 --> 00:33:25,630
I'm still here!

804
00:33:26,000 --> 00:33:27,070
Huh?
I said I'm here!

805
00:33:27,130 --> 00:33:28,670
But you'll be gone.

806
00:33:28,740 --> 00:33:29,770
Pretty soon, yeah.

807
00:33:29,840 --> 00:33:31,200
No way! I'm right here!

808
00:33:31,270 --> 00:33:32,270
In like five minutes.

809
00:33:32,340 --> 00:33:33,570
No way, no way!

810
00:33:33,640 --> 00:33:37,210
Can we at least get serious
just one time and do this?

811
00:33:37,280 --> 00:33:38,680
Here we go!

812
00:33:41,650 --> 00:33:42,750
Let's do this!

813
00:33:42,950 --> 00:33:44,980
We just have to stack them,
and that's it, right?

814
00:33:45,050 --> 00:33:46,390
Yeah, just stack them.

815
00:33:46,450 --> 00:33:47,450
With our names, right?

816
00:33:47,520 --> 00:33:49,790
You say your name,
and stack them.

817
00:33:49,860 --> 00:33:51,020
A name and then stack.

818
00:33:51,420 --> 00:33:52,760
Yell it loudly!

819
00:33:52,860 --> 00:33:53,930
Here we go

820
00:33:53,990 --> 00:33:56,330
Tofu woodblock game yay!

821
00:33:58,430 --> 00:33:59,730
Ikko

822
00:34:02,000 --> 00:34:03,740
Soshina

823
00:34:06,770 --> 00:34:08,440
Bald doll

824
00:34:09,340 --> 00:34:10,340
Bald doll?

825
00:34:10,410 --> 00:34:11,810
Okay, stop.

826
00:34:15,150 --> 00:34:16,320
Bald doll?

827
00:34:18,220 --> 00:34:19,450
You're more than that.

828
00:34:19,890 --> 00:34:21,020
Well, I'm balding.

829
00:34:21,120 --> 00:34:22,720
What about your jaw or your skin?

830
00:34:22,790 --> 00:34:24,220
Balding comes third, yeah.

831
00:34:24,290 --> 00:34:26,030
My skin is fine already.

832
00:34:26,090 --> 00:34:27,730
It's really not.
It's getting worse!

833
00:34:27,790 --> 00:34:28,830
And the jaw?

834
00:34:29,660 --> 00:34:31,660
My jaw sticks out a little.

835
00:34:33,070 --> 00:34:34,570
Sticks out like a sore thumb.

836
00:34:35,440 --> 00:34:37,370
Besides, you're not balding.

837
00:34:37,470 --> 00:34:39,510
- I have more hair, but also less.
- What?

838
00:34:39,570 --> 00:34:41,110
It comes and goes.

839
00:34:42,340 --> 00:34:45,550
- Just leave it at Inada.
- Understood.

840
00:34:45,610 --> 00:34:46,950
Say your own name.

841
00:34:47,380 --> 00:34:48,680
Do it again, then.

842
00:34:49,050 --> 00:34:50,220
Let's do it again!

843
00:34:50,920 --> 00:34:51,880
From the start.

844
00:34:52,550 --> 00:34:54,350
Okay, Matsuo-san.

845
00:34:55,690 --> 00:34:57,320
Let's do it from Cookie!

846
00:34:57,660 --> 00:34:58,660
Why me?

847
00:34:58,720 --> 00:35:01,030
This is completely impossible.

848
00:35:01,430 --> 00:35:06,230
He came up with the game,
and only just did something?

849
00:35:07,700 --> 00:35:08,900
He sucks!

850
00:35:10,500 --> 00:35:11,970
I want to see Cookie do it!

851
00:35:12,040 --> 00:35:13,840
Alright, I'll do it.

852
00:35:13,910 --> 00:35:15,780
But Nadal hasn't stacked his yet.

853
00:35:16,040 --> 00:35:17,780
-You want to, right?
-Neither have I.

854
00:35:17,880 --> 00:35:19,580
Do I still go now?

855
00:35:19,950 --> 00:35:21,980
You haven't done it,
but I'm still next?

856
00:35:23,650 --> 00:35:25,750
Me, Koumoto-san, Cookie.
Let's do that.

857
00:35:25,950 --> 00:35:28,020
But Koumoto wants me
to go next, right?

858
00:35:28,090 --> 00:35:29,960
What's with your tone, man?

859
00:35:30,090 --> 00:35:31,090
Wanna do it, Nadal?

860
00:35:31,160 --> 00:35:32,330
You all sound weird.

861
00:35:32,390 --> 00:35:33,860
I want Cookie to go next.

862
00:35:33,930 --> 00:35:36,500
You wanna go, right?!
After me, then.

863
00:35:38,100 --> 00:35:39,100
Try again.

864
00:35:39,170 --> 00:35:40,370
"Try again"?

865
00:35:46,640 --> 00:35:48,840
Wait, what's this?
What's going on?

866
00:35:50,640 --> 00:35:51,780
Why are we rotating?

867
00:35:51,840 --> 00:35:53,780
-I want Cookie to go next!
-Let's go.

868
00:35:53,850 --> 00:35:55,750
-I want Cookie to go next.
-That's it.

869
00:35:56,250 --> 00:35:58,450
I want Cookie to go next, 'kay?!

870
00:35:58,850 --> 00:36:00,090
What's with you?

871
00:36:01,350 --> 00:36:02,760
You wanna go?

872
00:36:03,790 --> 00:36:05,890
Rock, paper, schizzles!

873
00:36:05,960 --> 00:36:07,330
Whoever wins
gets another try, 'kay?!

874
00:36:07,390 --> 00:36:09,860
And turn arizzle, 'kay?!

875
00:36:17,400 --> 00:36:19,240
I don't get it,
so I can't laugh.

876
00:36:19,310 --> 00:36:21,570
That was close!

877
00:36:22,340 --> 00:36:24,510
That was really close!

878
00:36:25,110 --> 00:36:26,580
Ready, Cookie-san?

879
00:36:26,780 --> 00:36:28,250
I go next?

880
00:36:28,480 --> 00:36:31,220
I put this here, right?
Do I take it?

881
00:36:31,350 --> 00:36:32,990
-Let's go from the "yay"
-Ah, right.

882
00:36:33,090 --> 00:36:34,590
The cheer,
Jimmy-san.

883
00:36:34,650 --> 00:36:36,090
Okay...

884
00:36:37,790 --> 00:36:39,990
Tofu woodblock game, yay!

885
00:36:40,060 --> 00:36:41,230
So underwhelming.

886
00:36:42,300 --> 00:36:43,960
Ikuina Akiko

887
00:36:44,530 --> 00:36:45,600
Huh?

888
00:36:45,670 --> 00:36:46,870
No, man.

889
00:36:47,270 --> 00:36:48,470
That's so wrong.

890
00:36:48,570 --> 00:36:49,770
Cookie-san.

891
00:36:50,900 --> 00:36:53,140
But Inada was spacing out,
so I could do that.

892
00:36:53,510 --> 00:36:54,910
I wasn't spacing out.

893
00:36:56,180 --> 00:36:59,610
Use yer right name.
What're ya doin'?

894
00:36:59,980 --> 00:37:02,680
We're not playin' at all.
The hell you doin'?

895
00:37:05,120 --> 00:37:06,520
Don't get that mad.

896
00:37:07,690 --> 00:37:08,920
Jimmy-san, let's go.

897
00:37:09,320 --> 00:37:10,720
We're not playin'!

898
00:37:11,020 --> 00:37:12,020
Who was this?

899
00:37:12,090 --> 00:37:13,790
What's with this tofu woodblock game?

900
00:37:14,260 --> 00:37:16,760
Well, uh...

901
00:37:17,400 --> 00:37:20,100
We just have to stack five of them.

902
00:37:20,370 --> 00:37:21,600
Five?!

903
00:37:21,730 --> 00:37:22,800
All of us?!

904
00:37:22,870 --> 00:37:24,240
What's with this game?

905
00:37:24,600 --> 00:37:28,440
What's fun about this?!
A game of just five blocks?

906
00:37:29,680 --> 00:37:32,110
Um... I guess...

907
00:37:32,410 --> 00:37:34,410
It's ordering others around.

908
00:37:34,480 --> 00:37:36,350
That's the charm?

909
00:37:36,580 --> 00:37:38,120
Let's do that, then.

910
00:37:38,520 --> 00:37:40,990
So I just have to stack
five of them?

911
00:37:42,050 --> 00:37:43,890
Who are they fighting?

912
00:37:46,130 --> 00:37:47,930
You do it,
if you lose here!

913
00:37:48,730 --> 00:37:50,330
"You"? Call me Cookie, man.

914
00:37:50,400 --> 00:37:51,660
Cookie, do it!

915
00:37:54,300 --> 00:37:55,870
Aren't these four already?

916
00:37:56,200 --> 00:37:57,500
This is the last one.

917
00:37:57,740 --> 00:37:59,270
This might work.

918
00:37:59,340 --> 00:38:00,770
Just five seconds, right?

919
00:38:00,940 --> 00:38:02,740
-And then...
-Five seconds, right?

920
00:38:02,980 --> 00:38:03,980
There we go.

921
00:38:04,480 --> 00:38:05,480
Five seconds after letting go?

922
00:38:06,380 --> 00:38:07,810
Let go, let go!

923
00:38:07,880 --> 00:38:09,180
Wait after letting go!

924
00:38:09,350 --> 00:38:10,550
Let go!

925
00:38:10,880 --> 00:38:12,080
Wait up!!

926
00:38:12,350 --> 00:38:13,350
Let go, man!

927
00:38:13,420 --> 00:38:14,520
Isn't he moving them?

928
00:38:14,590 --> 00:38:15,790
Why are you doing that?

929
00:38:15,860 --> 00:38:17,390
Let go already!

930
00:38:18,890 --> 00:38:20,130
Cookie, you can let go.

931
00:38:20,190 --> 00:38:21,690
Jimmy-san, penalize him!

932
00:38:22,730 --> 00:38:23,860
In five seconds.

933
00:38:24,160 --> 00:38:25,260
Cookie, let go!

934
00:38:25,330 --> 00:38:27,700
Wait, wait,
wait wait wait!

935
00:38:27,770 --> 00:38:29,570
I'll be the only one losing!

936
00:38:30,670 --> 00:38:33,240
I'm keeping it in place,
it'll bounce if I let go.

937
00:38:34,270 --> 00:38:35,270
Let go.

938
00:38:35,340 --> 00:38:37,410
I'm telling you
it's gonna bounce for sure!

939
00:38:37,610 --> 00:38:39,310
Let go, and raise your hands.

940
00:38:39,750 --> 00:38:41,610
Just shut up,
and do it.

941
00:38:41,680 --> 00:38:44,220
Why do I have to
lose no matter what?

942
00:38:44,380 --> 00:38:46,050
It'll bounce if I let go!

943
00:38:46,220 --> 00:38:47,750
What do you mean bounce?

944
00:38:49,090 --> 00:38:50,490
Tofu doesn't bounce!

945
00:38:51,320 --> 00:38:52,460
Let go, man!

946
00:38:52,590 --> 00:38:54,060
Cookie, let go, Cookie!

947
00:38:54,760 --> 00:38:56,300
Jimmy-san,
penalize him already!

948
00:38:56,530 --> 00:38:59,070
With one hand?
Or both hands?

949
00:38:59,130 --> 00:39:00,170
What?

950
00:39:00,230 --> 00:39:01,300
Can I use both hands?

951
00:39:01,370 --> 00:39:03,200
Let go already!

952
00:39:03,270 --> 00:39:04,700
I'm not talking about that!

953
00:39:04,770 --> 00:39:06,410
I'm asking if I can
use both hands!

954
00:39:06,470 --> 00:39:08,840
Sure.
Really?!

955
00:39:08,970 --> 00:39:11,040
Five seconds
after pushing down?

956
00:39:11,110 --> 00:39:12,450
No way!
Let go!

957
00:39:12,610 --> 00:39:14,110
Then tell us the fucking rules!

958
00:39:14,180 --> 00:39:16,020
You can't do that!
Let go!

959
00:39:16,080 --> 00:39:17,320
Are you fucking daft?!

960
00:39:17,380 --> 00:39:18,850
You have to let go, man!

961
00:39:18,920 --> 00:39:20,320
You're dumb as a brick.

962
00:39:22,320 --> 00:39:25,890
You can't use both hands.
Just one!

963
00:39:25,960 --> 00:39:27,590
You said it was okay!

964
00:39:28,160 --> 00:39:30,000
You said I could
use both hands!

965
00:39:30,430 --> 00:39:31,930
I told you to let go.

966
00:39:34,800 --> 00:39:35,970
Let go, man.

967
00:39:36,040 --> 00:39:38,870
Why do I have to carry the loss?

968
00:39:39,140 --> 00:39:40,140
You're gonna lose?

969
00:39:40,210 --> 00:39:42,240
"Carry the loss" isn't a nice way
to put it.

970
00:39:42,310 --> 00:39:44,780
Why did you decide I would be
carrying it, then?

971
00:39:44,840 --> 00:39:46,910
You said we should
stack them in fives!

972
00:39:46,980 --> 00:39:48,310
It's gonna bounce, man!

973
00:39:48,710 --> 00:39:51,750
It'll only bounce if you put pressure!

974
00:39:51,980 --> 00:39:53,620
-Why are you doing that?
-Here we go.

975
00:39:53,690 --> 00:39:56,690
You still have to wait five seconds
after letting go.

976
00:39:57,190 --> 00:40:01,360
What happens if I win
after five seconds?

977
00:40:02,190 --> 00:40:03,930
If you win, it's over.

978
00:40:04,260 --> 00:40:06,000
I want it to end already.

979
00:40:06,070 --> 00:40:07,070
Please end this.

980
00:40:07,130 --> 00:40:09,300
Can we count the five seconds quicker?

981
00:40:09,700 --> 00:40:11,770
I might die
for you bastards!

982
00:40:12,770 --> 00:40:13,810
With that speed?

983
00:40:15,070 --> 00:40:16,210
Yeah, it's quick.

984
00:40:16,380 --> 00:40:17,540
I'm letting go, okay?

985
00:40:17,610 --> 00:40:18,610
Here I go.

986
00:40:20,780 --> 00:40:21,850
Wait

987
00:40:23,720 --> 00:40:27,090
He only needs to let the right hand go.

988
00:40:27,350 --> 00:40:28,420
Do it.

989
00:40:28,490 --> 00:40:30,260
It's a really unstable balance.

990
00:40:30,420 --> 00:40:31,620
It's gonna work!

991
00:40:31,990 --> 00:40:34,130
This really feels like
playing jenga, seriously.

992
00:40:38,000 --> 00:40:40,070
Wait, wait!
Don't do that!

993
00:40:40,870 --> 00:40:43,000
No way!
It was gonna fall!

994
00:40:43,300 --> 00:40:44,600
I'm not gonna let it fall.

995
00:40:44,670 --> 00:40:45,840
No, no,
then you have to go in.

996
00:40:46,270 --> 00:40:47,610
Are you stupid?

997
00:40:48,710 --> 00:40:49,980
It worked!

998
00:40:51,880 --> 00:40:54,180
It's gonna work!
1 2 3...

999
00:40:54,250 --> 00:40:55,550
You can't touch it!

1000
00:40:55,610 --> 00:40:56,880
Wait, Koumoto-san.

1001
00:40:58,220 --> 00:40:59,220
Okay, done.

1002
00:40:59,290 --> 00:41:00,320
I haven't laughed.

1003
00:41:01,390 --> 00:41:02,390
Damn it!

1004
00:41:06,260 --> 00:41:08,730
It's working, it's working!

1005
00:41:09,860 --> 00:41:12,730
It's working!

1006
00:41:13,500 --> 00:41:14,670
That was long.

1007
00:41:14,730 --> 00:41:16,240
Why did it work?!

1008
00:41:16,300 --> 00:41:17,800
What's with this game?

1009
00:41:18,600 --> 00:41:23,580
Okay, so there were two people...

1010
00:41:23,980 --> 00:41:26,980
It might've been both,
or just one.

1011
00:41:27,710 --> 00:41:30,120
Cookie or Nadal!

1012
00:41:30,180 --> 00:41:32,050
I didn't smile, for real!

1013
00:41:32,280 --> 00:41:34,890
Nadal definitely smiled at some point!

1014
00:41:34,950 --> 00:41:37,020
No, that was just because
Cookie-san smiled!

1015
00:41:37,090 --> 00:41:39,760
You did because he smiled?

1016
00:41:40,030 --> 00:41:42,090
Nadal doesn't want to accept
he smiled!

1017
00:41:42,160 --> 00:41:44,460
It was just since that
beep beep sound started!

1018
00:41:45,330 --> 00:41:47,530
What "beep beep" sound?

1019
00:41:47,600 --> 00:41:48,730
The siren?!

1020
00:41:48,800 --> 00:41:50,340
I had never heard that.

1021
00:41:51,100 --> 00:41:52,100
There it is!

1022
00:41:54,310 --> 00:41:56,880
It's gonna work!
1 2 3...

1023
00:41:56,940 --> 00:41:58,040
You can't touch it!

1024
00:41:58,110 --> 00:41:59,280
Wait, Koumoto-san.

1025
00:42:00,780 --> 00:42:01,780
Okay, it's done!

1026
00:42:02,380 --> 00:42:04,680
He's smiling!
He's definitely smiling!

1027
00:42:04,980 --> 00:42:06,820
Okay, now what?!

1028
00:42:06,920 --> 00:42:09,120
To be honest,
I brought the most weapons with me!

1029
00:42:09,190 --> 00:42:10,390
No, no, no, you were just smiling!

1030
00:42:10,460 --> 00:42:12,660
In any case, Cookie, here...

1031
00:42:13,190 --> 00:42:14,330
Orange!

1032
00:42:14,730 --> 00:42:16,700
There it is.
One for the champion.

1033
00:42:16,930 --> 00:42:18,100
Nadal is still safe.

1034
00:42:18,160 --> 00:42:19,870
I'm gonna watch out from now on!

1035
00:42:19,930 --> 00:42:22,100
After what Cookie did, right?

1036
00:42:22,530 --> 00:42:25,140
Whose point was that?
It's hard to tell.

1037
00:42:27,010 --> 00:42:30,410
I laughed at myself.
So I can get a point.

1038
00:42:30,480 --> 00:42:31,540
What's with that?

1039
00:42:36,720 --> 00:42:38,680
Hmm...

1040
00:42:38,750 --> 00:42:41,420
It was pretty decent.

1041
00:42:41,490 --> 00:42:43,620
Looking back, yeah.

1042
00:42:43,690 --> 00:42:45,690
It was pretty good, actually.

1043
00:42:45,960 --> 00:42:48,160
What a polite
Documental!

1044
00:42:48,230 --> 00:42:50,930
For real
nothing seemed out of place.

1045
00:42:51,000 --> 00:42:52,800
It felt just right!

1046
00:42:52,870 --> 00:42:55,630
Admirable Japanese behavior.

1047
00:42:56,170 --> 00:42:57,440
Elegant and graceful.

1048
00:42:59,270 --> 00:43:04,240
My book was fine as well?
It was pretty high quality.

1049
00:43:04,410 --> 00:43:06,650
That's just a part
of Japanese culture!

1050
00:43:09,420 --> 00:43:13,590
I think Amazon-san would be glad
to import something like that.

1051
00:43:15,490 --> 00:43:19,490
It was a good show.
High class humor.

1052
00:43:19,560 --> 00:43:21,460
High class humor?!

1053
00:43:21,760 --> 00:43:23,500
With that picture book,

1054
00:43:23,560 --> 00:43:26,130
It kinda makes you want to
invite friends to see it.

1055
00:43:27,170 --> 00:43:29,170
Tell them to come right away.

1056
00:43:29,840 --> 00:43:31,640
That's great!
