00:00:02,400 --> 00:00:06,010
Welcome to Wednesday Downtown,

2
00:00:06,010 --> 00:00:09,160
Let’s get on with our first presenter please

3
00:00:14,680 --> 00:00:17,020
Kamaitachi!

4
00:00:21,440 --> 00:00:25,050
The theory we bring this time is a second edition

5
00:00:25,050 --> 00:00:26,090
I see

6
00:00:26,090 --> 00:00:27,080
It is this:

7
00:00:27,080 --> 00:00:34,740
The 2nd If someone close by is dishing out good gossip, you'll forget work and be stuck in place

8
00:00:37,190 --> 00:00:38,740
Had to do a 2nd one quickly
-Yes

9
00:00:38,740 --> 00:00:40,300
Yeah, the first one hasn't been aired yet

10
00:00:40,300 --> 00:00:41,680
Indeed

11
00:00:41,680 --> 00:00:45,560
If it had been, then no one would fall for it

12
00:00:45,560 --> 00:00:46,960
Your explanation is very accurate

13
00:00:46,960 --> 00:00:48,950
But that said, the first time this guy really sat there completely motionless

14
00:00:48,950 --> 00:00:49,840
Really

15
00:00:51,290 --> 00:00:56,750
The show's AD had a relationship with an actress

16
00:00:51,400 --> 00:01:07,610
The topic of the relationship between the AD and the actress of the TV drama without saying the name to keep him there

17
00:00:56,750 --> 00:01:00,860
We tested how long he'd stay there listening

18
00:01:00,860 --> 00:01:01,780
He listened especially carefully

19
00:01:01,780 --> 00:01:03,560
Really listened very carefully

20
00:01:03,560 --> 00:01:07,610
With program staff waiting for him to join a meeting

21
00:01:07,610 --> 00:01:09,930
Unbelievably he was there for 16 minutes

22
00:01:09,930 --> 00:01:13,680
I waited for so long, but they did not say the name

23
00:01:13,680 --> 00:01:16,470
Who was it? It was hidden in such a roundabout way

24
00:01:17,020 --> 00:01:21,880
Don't sleep with ADs that talk like this

25
00:01:23,550 --> 00:01:25,190
What does everyone think?

26
00:01:25,190 --> 00:01:26,700
If you encounter this situation in a cafe

27
00:01:26,700 --> 00:01:31,690
In the TMC lounge, there's a kind of curtain that separates

28
00:01:31,690 --> 00:01:33,980
You can hear everything the person next to you says.
-Yeah

29
00:01:33,980 --> 00:01:40,430
Once an idol asked her agent "Please let me stop blogging"

30
00:01:40,430 --> 00:01:41,450
No, right?

31
00:01:41,450 --> 00:01:43,700
"I really want to stop" like that

32
00:01:44,180 --> 00:01:45,770
I did listen there without moving a muscle

33
00:01:45,770 --> 00:01:47,160
On a side note

34
00:01:47,160 --> 00:01:49,910
Hamaye mistakenly entered the women's room at TMC

35
00:01:49,910 --> 00:01:53,450
Screams of the Hinatazaka46 member's could be heard from outside

36
00:01:53,450 --> 00:01:54,700
This is really off-topic

37
00:01:54,700 --> 00:01:55,860
Off-topic indeed

38
00:01:56,520 --> 00:02:01,360
The gossip challenge returns again

39
00:02:01,360 --> 00:02:02,400
Also

40
00:02:02,660 --> 00:02:04,420
I want to be a "Troublemaker" YouTuber

41
00:02:04,660 --> 00:02:08,470
If a child says "I want to be a YouTuber who gets into trouble"

42
00:02:08,470 --> 00:02:12,560
No parent will say "Since it's your choice..." and show their support

43
00:02:12,560 --> 00:02:14,410
This theory will be tested

44
00:02:30,070 --> 00:02:39,310
Once again, if someone close by is dishing out good gossip, you'll forget work and be stuck in place

45
00:02:39,870 --> 00:02:47,010
This time, we also called the verification target to the coffee shop inside TBS under the name of a fake meeting

46
00:02:48,310 --> 00:02:51,480
While there, the meeting location changes and they are informed they need to get there as soon as possible

47
00:02:51,480 --> 00:02:56,520
Will they continue to stay and listen to the neighboring gossip?

48
00:02:58,470 --> 00:03:00,490
The first target is...

49
00:03:04,120 --> 00:03:06,880
Okubo

50
00:03:04,730 --> 00:03:05,980
Will definitely listen

51
00:03:06,990 --> 00:03:09,900
What kind of gossip do you plan to use this time?

52
00:03:09,900 --> 00:03:17,180
A classic topic like female ADs having sex with celebrities

53
00:03:17,690 --> 00:03:21,830
Let's cut to the chase and start the gossip

54
00:03:23,240 --> 00:03:29,020
I went to a hotel with a comedian some time ago

55
00:03:29,020 --> 00:03:30,660
Comedian?

56
00:03:30,660 --> 00:03:32,670
It's bad, right? What should I do?

57
00:03:32,820 --> 00:03:34,030
Who is it? Which comedian?

58
00:03:34,030 --> 00:03:37,330
Still considered very popular

59
00:03:37,330 --> 00:03:39,030
Which one?

60
00:03:38,150 --> 00:03:38,970
Seems to be listening a bit

61
00:03:39,030 --> 00:03:40,500
Do not tell anyone!

62
00:03:40,500 --> 00:03:41,730
I won't

63
00:03:40,540 --> 00:03:43,230
Gradually approaching
-Sitting position changed

64
00:03:42,830 --> 00:03:47,640
To tell you the truth, it was cheating

65
00:03:47,640 --> 00:03:49,470
That's a problem!

66
00:03:50,560 --> 00:03:51,970
Head up

67
00:03:51,300 --> 00:03:54,690
After hearing the keyword "cheating", her eyes change

68
00:03:55,310 --> 00:04:00,990
This time the tactic of naming the person is adopted

69
00:04:02,420 --> 00:04:03,420
Don't tell anyone!

70
00:04:03,420 --> 00:04:06,020
Like I'd say anything!

71
00:04:06,020 --> 00:04:08,160
It's Hitori

72
00:04:08,160 --> 00:04:08,930
Eh?

73
00:04:10,770 --> 00:04:11,920
Hitori!

74
00:04:12,590 --> 00:04:15,030
Ah, wait a minute I'm a little confused

75
00:04:15,430 --> 00:04:18,440
Gekidan Hitori?

76
00:04:17,070 --> 00:04:18,890
Don't use my name without permission!

77
00:04:18,440 --> 00:04:19,800
Eh? Eh?

78
00:04:19,800 --> 00:04:20,840
It's bad, isn't it?

79
00:04:20,840 --> 00:04:21,810
Look at her face

80
00:04:20,840 --> 00:04:21,810
Really, Hitori?

81
00:04:21,810 --> 00:04:22,840
Yes

82
00:04:23,110 --> 00:04:24,180
This is clearly a sigh

83
00:04:24,180 --> 00:04:27,810
Obviously shocked

84
00:04:26,800 --> 00:04:28,070
It was a blow

85
00:04:27,810 --> 00:04:31,320
Probably thinking, "Even Hitori?"

86
00:04:31,410 --> 00:04:33,850
Now it is especially troublesome

87
00:04:33,850 --> 00:04:34,690
Why?

88
00:04:34,690 --> 00:04:38,160
Because he has more than one lover

89
00:04:38,160 --> 00:04:38,690
Eh?

90
00:04:38,890 --> 00:04:39,760
No way!

91
00:04:39,220 --> 00:04:41,760
I've heard some rumors

92
00:04:41,760 --> 00:04:48,170
It seems that the relationship with his wife is not great now

93
00:04:42,640 --> 00:04:44,240
This is annoying

94
00:04:48,810 --> 00:04:55,140
She makes a sound as if to say "don't say such things out loud"

95
00:04:55,140 --> 00:04:56,780
Who is the other person?

96
00:04:56,780 --> 00:05:00,380
How can I put it? It's a big name

97
00:05:00,450 --> 00:05:03,350
If it's a big name, is it also an artist?

98
00:05:02,870 --> 00:05:04,660
A look of "stop it!"

99
00:05:03,350 --> 00:05:05,870
Yeah, yeah, it's bad, right?

100
00:05:05,370 --> 00:05:07,140
Okubo is a good person

101
00:05:05,910 --> 00:05:07,350
Wait, slow down. Who is it?

102
00:05:07,350 --> 00:05:10,390
I'll tell you later

103
00:05:10,920 --> 00:05:16,160
Using the name of the cheating partner as bait

104
00:05:13,620 --> 00:05:16,010
Okubo is really a good person

105
00:05:16,700 --> 00:05:18,670
And so, the manager calls

106
00:05:20,630 --> 00:05:22,830
Sorry, the staff just contacted me

107
00:05:22,830 --> 00:05:25,900
The meeting has been changed to the 4th floor of TBS

108
00:05:25,900 --> 00:05:28,270
Please come here

109
00:05:28,270 --> 00:05:29,070
The 4th floor?

110
00:05:29,070 --> 00:05:30,710
Yes, we'll wait for you on the 4th floor

111
00:05:32,000 --> 00:05:35,920
Now, she must get to the new location as soon as possible

112
00:05:35,920 --> 00:05:38,210
But will she instead stay and listen to the gossip?

113
00:05:38,840 --> 00:05:41,520
The challenge begins now

114
00:05:42,590 --> 00:05:45,120
Good-looking?

115
00:05:45,120 --> 00:05:47,860
Not really like a gyaru type, more like "clean" type

116
00:05:47,860 --> 00:05:49,990
Clean-cut

117
00:05:49,990 --> 00:05:55,770
Hitori seems like he likes that type
-It's true

118
00:05:55,770 --> 00:05:58,770
Indeed, seems like he doesn't have a preference for gyaru-type

119
00:05:59,060 --> 00:06:00,810
But aren't you a gyaru?

120
00:06:00,810 --> 00:06:01,910
Am I a gyaru?

121
00:06:01,910 --> 00:06:02,410
No?

122
00:06:02,410 --> 00:06:03,310
Am I a gyaru?

123
00:06:03,310 --> 00:06:04,530
Seems kind of obvious you are?

124
00:06:04,570 --> 00:06:06,950
Maybe an age thing

125
00:06:06,950 --> 00:06:10,150
He likes young ones?

126
00:06:10,150 --> 00:06:13,650
I don't want to do this... bad-mouth Shogo

127
00:06:10,150 --> 00:06:13,650
※A member of the same troupe whose real name is Kawashima Kengo

128
00:06:14,380 --> 00:06:16,520
What? This is cheating?

129
00:06:16,520 --> 00:06:19,060
But he's been especially kind to me

130
00:06:19,320 --> 00:06:21,830
Looking to confirm who they are

131
00:06:21,830 --> 00:06:22,990
Looks a bit annoyed

132
00:06:22,990 --> 00:06:26,660
Once the name "Shogo" came out she seems even more annoyed

133
00:06:25,190 --> 00:06:26,660
Angry?

134
00:06:28,140 --> 00:06:31,200
Angry at the rude woman

135
00:06:30,940 --> 00:06:32,900
You're so gentle, Okubo

136
00:06:32,070 --> 00:06:36,750
She listens for 5 minutes as the other cheater has not yet been revealed

137
00:06:35,530 --> 00:06:39,260
5 minutes is quite a long time

138
00:06:38,340 --> 00:06:42,650
The woman is also dating someone

139
00:06:42,710 --> 00:06:46,620
She's married too?

140
00:06:46,620 --> 00:06:48,290
So it looks like both sides are cheating?
-Yeah

141
00:06:49,190 --> 00:06:52,350
Unexpectedly, the topic turns to "both parties are cheating"

142
00:06:52,350 --> 00:06:54,900
And Okubo's features become squeezed together

143
00:06:55,050 --> 00:06:57,500
So emotionally invested

144
00:06:56,580 --> 00:06:57,510
But

145
00:06:58,710 --> 00:06:59,460
Stood up!

146
00:06:59,300 --> 00:07:04,340
Ah, although its a bit sudden pretend to start saying the name

147
00:07:05,000 --> 00:07:08,110
I'll give you the name, then

148
00:07:08,110 --> 00:07:09,570
Eh, really?

149
00:07:09,570 --> 00:07:12,140
Never tell anyone, ok?
-I won't!

150
00:07:12,980 --> 00:07:15,330
So, although she left her seat and got up

151
00:07:15,330 --> 00:07:19,260
She is stuck in place in order to get the answer

152
00:07:19,640 --> 00:07:21,370
A few more hints

153
00:07:21,690 --> 00:07:27,330
How can I say it? If the class is analogous, the number of students is about 1~15

154
00:07:21,690 --> 00:07:27,330
No phone call

155
00:07:27,390 --> 00:07:29,330
The name is "a"

156
00:07:29,330 --> 00:07:35,770
The name starts with the "a" column or row of the kana syllabary

157
00:07:30,620 --> 00:07:31,850
Say it quickly!

158
00:07:32,290 --> 00:07:34,350
Non-existent phone call

159
00:07:35,770 --> 00:07:37,070
That's too broad a scope

160
00:07:37,070 --> 00:07:37,840
So its the "a" column or row of the kana syllabary

161
00:07:37,840 --> 00:07:40,810
"A" column or row of the kana syllabary?

162
00:07:40,810 --> 00:07:41,910
Eh? "A" column or row of the kana syllabary?

163
00:07:41,910 --> 00:07:44,180
An "A" column or row of the kana syllabary person

164
00:07:47,680 --> 00:07:49,610
Why did you stand up and not go?

165
00:07:48,110 --> 00:07:50,180
If you want to go, go

166
00:07:50,180 --> 00:07:52,020
Sit down, sit down, its better, right?

167
00:07:51,120 --> 00:07:52,020
Yeah!

168
00:07:53,830 --> 00:07:55,080
Unwrapping wet wipes

169
00:07:53,950 --> 00:07:56,850
Ah but the person i'm thinking of is not married

170
00:07:55,760 --> 00:07:57,310
What will happen?

171
00:07:56,850 --> 00:07:58,290
Yeah, they're married

172
00:07:58,560 --> 00:08:02,490
Moreover, her husband is also a famous person

173
00:08:02,640 --> 00:08:03,980
Both sides are in the industry?

174
00:08:03,960 --> 00:08:07,200
Her husband still has a lot of fans

175
00:08:04,200 --> 00:08:06,630
Giving up?

176
00:08:08,120 --> 00:08:08,940
Who is it?

177
00:08:09,260 --> 00:08:11,170
Although stuck for a while

178
00:08:11,170 --> 00:08:13,250
She eventually leaves the store

179
00:08:14,490 --> 00:08:16,810
So, we reveal the truth

180
00:08:20,000 --> 00:08:22,780
Okubo

181
00:08:22,780 --> 00:08:25,750
Both sides cheated on the other one, do you know?

182
00:08:27,820 --> 00:08:29,350
Aibu Saki, right?

183
00:08:31,220 --> 00:08:33,540
She got that from the "a"

184
00:08:33,680 --> 00:08:35,890
I was really angry

185
00:08:35,890 --> 00:08:37,300
This is inside the TV station!

186
00:08:37,300 --> 00:08:40,730
Talking out loud about cheating!?

187
00:08:40,730 --> 00:08:42,470
It's really not right

188
00:08:42,470 --> 00:08:44,140
So you coughed to remind them

189
00:08:44,140 --> 00:08:46,500
"Don't say this." "People can hear you."

190
00:08:46,600 --> 00:08:50,040
It doesn't matter if she's a TBS employee or a production company employee

191
00:08:50,380 --> 00:08:51,280
She's probably stupid and a bad person

192
00:08:51,280 --> 00:08:53,510
Really stupid and bad

193
00:08:53,510 --> 00:08:58,020
She looked a bit like Osawa Akane

194
00:08:58,020 --> 00:09:00,720
Not sure how but just seems a bit similar

195
00:09:01,320 --> 00:09:04,560
So, we explained the project

196
00:09:05,390 --> 00:09:07,660
Ah, I see

197
00:09:07,660 --> 00:09:10,800
Talking about comedians

198
00:09:10,800 --> 00:09:12,460
Such an excellent person

199
00:09:12,460 --> 00:09:14,330
Hitori is such a nice person so I really couldn't stand it

200
00:09:14,330 --> 00:09:15,430
I had the feeling of regret

201
00:09:14,830 --> 00:09:16,130
So nice!

202
00:09:15,530 --> 00:09:17,240
That aspect was conveyed
-You got it, right?

203
00:09:17,240 --> 00:09:19,570
You had the look of "Not Hitori too!"

204
00:09:19,570 --> 00:09:22,540
There's so many talented people that get mixed up in this sort of thing

205
00:09:22,540 --> 00:09:24,340
It was Watanabe all over again

206
00:09:24,340 --> 00:09:26,780
Yes, it really gave me the feeling of another Watanabe

207
00:09:27,190 --> 00:09:33,480
So, Oasis Okubo's record of 7 minutes and 11 seconds temporarily ranks first

208
00:09:29,020 --> 00:09:33,050
7 minutes is still quite long

209
00:09:34,500 --> 00:09:36,300
The next target is

210
00:09:40,850 --> 00:09:44,400
Nadal

211
00:09:44,000 --> 00:09:45,210
He loves to gossip

212
00:09:45,210 --> 00:09:48,330
This is cheating-realted news

213
00:09:49,020 --> 00:09:51,020
Ugh, no good

214
00:09:52,530 --> 00:09:53,540
What's going on?

215
00:09:53,540 --> 00:09:57,040
I was just contacted by a published

216
00:09:57,040 --> 00:09:59,140
They sent me the article

217
00:09:59,140 --> 00:10:00,980
Hasn't been released yet

218
00:10:00,980 --> 00:10:02,350
Its cheating news

219
00:10:02,350 --> 00:10:04,020
Eh... cheating?

220
00:10:04,020 --> 00:10:05,050
Yes

221
00:10:05,050 --> 00:10:08,120
This time it's a really big deal

222
00:10:08,120 --> 00:10:10,190
Quite a surprising person

223
00:10:10,190 --> 00:10:11,860
Eh, who is it?

224
00:10:13,160 --> 00:10:15,530
You absolutely wont tell anyone, right?

225
00:10:15,530 --> 00:10:18,230
Tell me, I won't tell anyone

226
00:10:18,660 --> 00:10:21,730
How to put it...

227
00:10:21,730 --> 00:10:22,700
Mikitty

228
00:10:22,830 --> 00:10:25,240
Me this time?

229
00:10:25,470 --> 00:10:26,970
Eh, Mikitty? Is it Miki Fujimoto?

230
00:10:26,970 --> 00:10:28,840
You're too loud.
-Sorry, sorry, sorry

231
00:10:28,840 --> 00:10:30,910
Yes, Miki Fujimoto

232
00:10:30,910 --> 00:10:32,740
Uh, really?

233
00:10:32,940 --> 00:10:36,210
I can't believe it! Poor Shoji!

234
00:10:33,840 --> 00:10:34,700
Listening

235
00:10:36,210 --> 00:10:40,080
Really? Even Mikitty would cheat?

236
00:10:38,000 --> 00:10:39,310
The eyes are moving

237
00:10:41,450 --> 00:10:45,390
Black eyes are wandering

238
00:10:45,390 --> 00:10:47,010
Really listening!

239
00:10:46,360 --> 00:10:50,070
A sudden shock for a famous couple

240
00:10:50,070 --> 00:10:53,330
Nadal consumes the gossip wholeheartedly

241
00:10:53,330 --> 00:10:55,330
Then

242
00:10:56,430 --> 00:11:00,140
It's not impossible if the people are similar

243
00:11:00,140 --> 00:11:02,510
This kind of thing can happen

244
00:11:02,510 --> 00:11:03,980
Yes, indeed

245
00:11:04,140 --> 00:11:06,840
Put the headphones on

246
00:11:07,180 --> 00:11:07,880
This is a gimmick, right?

247
00:11:07,880 --> 00:11:14,420
Wearing earphones as if not listening to other people talking but is in fact eavesdropping

248
00:11:12,690 --> 00:11:14,620
Everyone is doing it!

249
00:11:14,620 --> 00:11:16,550
Letting one's guard down here

250
00:11:15,550 --> 00:11:20,190
But the cheating partner is also unimaginable

251
00:11:20,190 --> 00:11:21,390
Is it a problem?

252
00:11:21,390 --> 00:11:23,560
Eh? What's wrong?

253
00:11:23,560 --> 00:11:25,760
Who was the cheating partner?

254
00:11:25,930 --> 00:11:29,800
Took the right earphone out

255
00:11:31,100 --> 00:11:34,160
So, as the name comes up, the phone call comes in

256
00:11:34,160 --> 00:11:37,360
As usual, he is told the meeting location has changed

257
00:11:38,700 --> 00:11:41,340
Now, the challenge begins

258
00:11:42,510 --> 00:11:45,950
Who is the other one?

259
00:11:45,950 --> 00:11:48,290
Big name actor?

260
00:11:48,290 --> 00:11:50,920
Almost... an actor

261
00:11:51,360 --> 00:11:54,430
Famous? Someone I know?

262
00:11:52,590 --> 00:11:55,650
Listen carefully

263
00:11:54,430 --> 00:11:56,630
I'm certain you know them

264
00:11:56,630 --> 00:11:58,400
Eh, who is it...

265
00:11:58,430 --> 00:12:03,000
Recently been in comedy shows

266
00:12:04,200 --> 00:12:07,470
Recently been in comedy shows

267
00:12:07,470 --> 00:12:10,980
Oh, oh, oh, that means they're on variety shows too, right?

268
00:12:11,240 --> 00:12:14,650
Really listening carefully!

269
00:12:14,090 --> 00:12:15,440
Thinking about who it is

270
00:12:14,650 --> 00:12:17,320
No intention of leaving at all

271
00:12:16,830 --> 00:12:18,480
Such a serious expression

272
00:12:18,060 --> 00:12:19,440
This time

273
00:12:20,650 --> 00:12:23,720
Excuse me

274
00:12:23,720 --> 00:12:26,360
Can I have an iced coffee?

275
00:12:24,500 --> 00:12:25,570
Only wants to drink now

276
00:12:26,480 --> 00:12:29,790
He should only be wanting to hurry up and get to work

277
00:12:29,790 --> 00:12:31,360
In this state

278
00:12:31,360 --> 00:12:33,300
Ordered an iced coffee

279
00:12:35,000 --> 00:12:36,370
Ordered an iced coffee!

280
00:12:36,570 --> 00:12:39,900
Seems like he'll be here for a while

281
00:12:40,440 --> 00:12:42,440
But if you order a drink

282
00:12:41,030 --> 00:12:46,950
So 6 minutes passed with his iced coffee and gossip

283
00:12:43,270 --> 00:12:46,840
You can stay very naturally

284
00:12:47,900 --> 00:12:51,770
Then, the agent calls again

285
00:12:52,210 --> 00:12:55,900
It is difficult to do press conferences

286
00:12:55,900 --> 00:12:57,480
It's almost 8 minutes

287
00:12:57,480 --> 00:12:59,040
Needs to be done formally

288
00:12:59,390 --> 00:13:02,490
He hung up

289
00:13:02,560 --> 00:13:06,260
Its not good to just hang up

290
00:13:06,460 --> 00:13:08,470
Here comes a LINE message

291
00:13:08,470 --> 00:13:12,640
Sorry, my stomach hurts a little. I'll be right there when I get out of the bathroom

292
00:13:12,640 --> 00:13:13,140
He said he's in the toilet

293
00:13:13,140 --> 00:13:14,410
Speaking as if he's in the toilet

294
00:13:14,410 --> 00:13:16,440
That's too much, why the toilet?

295
00:13:16,830 --> 00:13:20,320
But 8 minutes into the process

296
00:13:21,510 --> 00:13:23,110
Is it really a name I would know?

297
00:13:23,110 --> 00:13:25,250
Absolutely. Famous

298
00:13:24,530 --> 00:13:25,610
Surely not

299
00:13:25,250 --> 00:13:27,050
Then tell me

300
00:13:27,320 --> 00:13:30,390
Ok, i'll tell you

301
00:13:30,990 --> 00:13:32,520
Ok, i'll tell you

302
00:13:32,520 --> 00:13:34,490
You'll really tell me? Who is it?

303
00:13:35,130 --> 00:13:40,260
Let's just say the initials are T
-T?

304
00:13:35,700 --> 00:13:36,330
He's stopped

305
00:13:38,790 --> 00:13:40,260
This posture is not normal, right?

306
00:13:40,260 --> 00:13:42,230
Who stands like this?

307
00:13:40,260 --> 00:13:43,070
Is it a last name or a first name with the initial T?

308
00:13:43,070 --> 00:13:46,040
Yes, yes, the initials of the surname is T

309
00:13:47,240 --> 00:13:49,570
Who is it... can't guess

310
00:13:49,570 --> 00:13:50,580
A few more hints

311
00:13:50,580 --> 00:13:53,310
No, you guess

312
00:13:53,310 --> 00:13:55,350
T... first name initial is T...

313
00:13:56,560 --> 00:13:59,770
It looks like the answer will not be given

314
00:13:59,770 --> 00:14:01,850
So he leaves

315
00:14:01,360 --> 00:14:04,570
It's been 9 minutes, so people are waiting

316
00:14:05,860 --> 00:14:07,960
Thank you for your hard work

317
00:14:13,460 --> 00:14:14,730
You were called, right?

318
00:14:14,730 --> 00:14:17,240
What? What's going on here?

319
00:14:17,240 --> 00:14:18,900
I'm completely confused about what is happening

320
00:14:18,900 --> 00:14:19,400
What is this?

321
00:14:19,600 --> 00:14:20,810
You really do care!

322
00:14:20,810 --> 00:14:22,570
Of course I care

323
00:14:22,570 --> 00:14:24,340
But he didn't say anything at all

324
00:14:24,340 --> 00:14:26,980
Has your impression of Miki Fujimoto changed?

325
00:14:27,040 --> 00:14:30,480
Aren't all idols like this?

326
00:14:31,040 --> 00:14:36,700
So Nadal's 9 minutes 07 seconds record is temporarily ranked first

327
00:14:37,600 --> 00:14:39,250
The next target is

328
00:14:42,080 --> 00:14:44,340
New York's Shimada

329
00:14:45,140 --> 00:14:49,370
Probably because of drug arrests and the like

330
00:14:49,370 --> 00:14:53,000
This guy is interested more in the dark side of show business

331
00:14:53,670 --> 00:14:57,140
I'm in trouble this time

332
00:14:57,140 --> 00:14:59,640
You know the show I'm working on, right?

333
00:14:59,640 --> 00:15:01,280
The one that has just started?
-Yes, yes

334
00:15:01,280 --> 00:15:03,510
I told you there would be idols in the show, right?

335
00:15:03,510 --> 00:15:05,370
A male idol

336
00:15:05,550 --> 00:15:08,920
Just a little while ago, during the shoot

337
00:15:08,920 --> 00:15:10,350
One person didn't show up.
-Late?

338
00:15:10,520 --> 00:15:13,020
No

339
00:15:13,020 --> 00:15:14,890
They were arrested

340
00:15:14,890 --> 00:15:16,460
Arrested? Handcuffed?

341
00:15:16,460 --> 00:15:17,630
Handcuffed and taken away

342
00:15:17,630 --> 00:15:18,230
Really?

343
00:15:18,230 --> 00:15:19,030
It was so bad

344
00:15:19,030 --> 00:15:19,730
Who is it?

345
00:15:19,730 --> 00:15:21,130
I'll tell you later

346
00:15:22,080 --> 00:15:25,350
So, as a rule, the name is again used to keep them hanging around

347
00:15:25,350 --> 00:15:27,630
As usual, he is told the meeting location has changed

348
00:15:28,910 --> 00:15:31,520
The challenge begins

349
00:15:32,110 --> 00:15:34,750
Now the other members of the group seem to have been told

350
00:15:34,750 --> 00:15:37,450
That the police are "watching them"

351
00:15:38,180 --> 00:15:40,150
This multi-person group

352
00:15:40,150 --> 00:15:46,890
Not only the one who was taken away, the other members were also being looked at

353
00:15:47,660 --> 00:15:50,860
But they don't seem the type at all

354
00:15:50,860 --> 00:15:54,700
Innocent-looking boys?

355
00:15:54,700 --> 00:15:57,770
More that type, yeah

356
00:15:55,840 --> 00:15:57,450
You're blatantly listening!

357
00:15:57,770 --> 00:16:00,470
Look a bit naughty though

358
00:16:00,470 --> 00:16:02,340
Rather than being naughty

359
00:16:01,730 --> 00:16:04,360
Turn your face a little better, right?

360
00:16:02,340 --> 00:16:05,640
They're not actually innocent

361
00:16:04,570 --> 00:16:05,970
Basically facing that way

362
00:16:05,640 --> 00:16:09,350
He's not even hiding that he's listening with this posture

363
00:16:09,810 --> 00:16:12,220
Its like three people talking

364
00:16:12,220 --> 00:16:14,230
A TV drama scene

365
00:16:14,690 --> 00:16:16,590
Three people in the same frame

366
00:16:16,890 --> 00:16:18,960
Here's a big tip for you

367
00:16:18,960 --> 00:16:23,730
"The person who sang this song", and take your iPhone and pretend to show it to him

368
00:16:23,930 --> 00:16:26,860
Okay, here's a hint

369
00:16:26,860 --> 00:16:30,030
This song, this song

370
00:16:33,330 --> 00:16:36,070
If you look like this, you'll be found out

371
00:16:36,470 --> 00:16:38,280
Really looking!

372
00:16:37,960 --> 00:16:40,730
Don't look so freely like that

373
00:16:38,280 --> 00:16:40,140
You can't look like that!

374
00:16:40,410 --> 00:16:42,280
You're really looking!

375
00:16:41,750 --> 00:16:43,670
So obvious

376
00:16:42,280 --> 00:16:44,720
Everyone will want to see

377
00:16:44,720 --> 00:16:46,380
Start humming

378
00:16:46,380 --> 00:16:49,650
Please hum it in a very low voice

379
00:16:53,960 --> 00:16:56,660
You got it?
-Well... not really

380
00:16:56,890 --> 00:16:58,730
A little more, a little more humming

381
00:17:05,640 --> 00:17:07,080
Thinking about it

382
00:17:11,110 --> 00:17:13,910
Hurry up and go to the meeting!

383
00:17:15,170 --> 00:17:17,770
Just a melody with no right answer

384
00:17:17,770 --> 00:17:20,200
While thinking about what the song is, another 3 minutes have passed

385
00:17:21,600 --> 00:17:22,550
At this time

386
00:17:23,360 --> 00:17:25,180
Let's go, give up

387
00:17:25,460 --> 00:17:27,730
Ah, he's stoop up

388
00:17:28,130 --> 00:17:30,730
Please say "The girlfriend was arrested too"

389
00:17:31,100 --> 00:17:34,600
The girlfriend was also arrested together

390
00:17:34,600 --> 00:17:36,270
She's an actress

391
00:17:36,270 --> 00:17:37,100
It should be worse for her

392
00:17:37,570 --> 00:17:40,940
Of course it's bad, because there are in a lot of commercials

393
00:17:40,740 --> 00:17:43,870
Will he go? Finally gone?

394
00:17:43,870 --> 00:17:45,780
Ah, he's gone!

395
00:17:45,780 --> 00:17:47,980
Wow, he's really gone!

396
00:17:48,010 --> 00:17:54,420
The truth is revealed

397
00:17:52,510 --> 00:17:54,100
What is this?

398
00:17:54,420 --> 00:17:56,650
Don't you care that the girlfriend was arrested too?

399
00:17:56,650 --> 00:17:59,660
It was an actress

400
00:17:59,660 --> 00:18:01,430
I don't care if it's an actress, but...

401
00:18:01,430 --> 00:18:03,680
It would have been good if the information had come out 30 seconds earlier

402
00:18:04,060 --> 00:18:05,700
Did you listen to the humming?

403
00:18:05,700 --> 00:18:07,330
I listened to it

404
00:18:07,330 --> 00:18:09,130
What song do you think it is?

405
00:18:10,800 --> 00:18:13,670
How can I know that? Just from humming

406
00:18:13,670 --> 00:18:15,760
Not at all!

407
00:18:14,200 --> 00:18:17,220
So, the final target is...

408
00:18:22,510 --> 00:18:24,090
Panther's Ogata

409
00:18:23,110 --> 00:18:24,720
Ogata

410
00:18:38,430 --> 00:18:41,230
The topic that will most draw his attention

411
00:18:41,230 --> 00:18:44,800
I think it also has to be about his wife

412
00:18:44,800 --> 00:18:45,840
That's right

413
00:18:45,840 --> 00:18:50,170
He has an abnormal sense of jealousy

414
00:18:50,440 --> 00:18:55,510
If its about her cheating

415
00:18:55,510 --> 00:18:57,010
Affair-related topics

416
00:18:57,010 --> 00:19:00,920
I think he will definitely be stuck in place

417
00:18:58,910 --> 00:18:59,980
Is that ok?

418
00:19:02,450 --> 00:19:04,880
It's scary. It's scary to say that

419
00:19:05,220 --> 00:19:07,530
Heard something from a weekly journalist

420
00:19:07,530 --> 00:19:09,690
Wait. What's the news?

421
00:19:09,690 --> 00:19:11,200
The report is not yet out

422
00:19:11,200 --> 00:19:12,060
Hmm?

423
00:19:12,400 --> 00:19:14,200
Cheating-related

424
00:19:14,200 --> 00:19:15,160
Cheating?

425
00:19:15,160 --> 00:19:16,730
Shh-

426
00:19:16,410 --> 00:19:18,000
The performance is really natural

427
00:19:18,570 --> 00:19:21,310
But this time is different

428
00:19:20,020 --> 00:19:21,940
Good performance

429
00:19:21,310 --> 00:19:23,840
Not from the celebrity themself

430
00:19:24,140 --> 00:19:25,380
Oh...

431
00:19:25,380 --> 00:19:31,050
It's the celebrity's wife who cheated

432
00:19:32,750 --> 00:19:33,920
I see...

433
00:19:33,920 --> 00:19:34,550
It's bad

434
00:19:35,950 --> 00:19:37,690
Just a moment ago he glanced over

435
00:19:38,060 --> 00:19:39,020
Its like the fishing rod bobbing slightly

436
00:19:39,020 --> 00:19:42,290
Now he's definitely hooked

437
00:19:42,640 --> 00:19:46,970
So, he's informed of the location change

438
00:19:49,730 --> 00:19:52,360
And the challenge begins

439
00:19:54,340 --> 00:19:58,080
This lady, how to put it, is about thirty-something years old

440
00:19:58,080 --> 00:20:01,110
Thirty-something years old

441
00:19:59,480 --> 00:20:01,690
What a great way to act out a conversation

442
00:20:01,680 --> 00:20:03,950
It's really good, like the real thing

443
00:20:01,750 --> 00:20:04,520
Previously did clothing-related work

444
00:20:05,820 --> 00:20:08,950
What kind of person is the lady's cheating partner?

445
00:20:09,080 --> 00:20:11,320
Because that person is a comedian

446
00:20:11,320 --> 00:20:12,160
As a comedian...

447
00:20:12,160 --> 00:20:13,420
Comedian?

448
00:20:14,930 --> 00:20:18,430
Sometimes shooting takes place at their home

449
00:20:15,100 --> 00:20:17,170
Moved

450
00:20:18,430 --> 00:20:20,330
Look how he's shifting in his chair

451
00:20:20,330 --> 00:20:22,430
Just shifted to the side

452
00:20:22,860 --> 00:20:25,970
Recording takes place in their home quite a lot

453
00:20:25,970 --> 00:20:32,680
So there are directors who have been there many times

454
00:20:32,680 --> 00:20:35,310
So that's how it happened

455
00:20:33,920 --> 00:20:34,700
Good performance

456
00:20:35,310 --> 00:20:37,720
Wait a minute, wait a minute, who the hell is it?

457
00:20:37,720 --> 00:20:40,120
I'll tell you later

458
00:20:40,120 --> 00:20:42,990
You have to tell me

459
00:20:42,990 --> 00:20:44,720
Already looks like he thinks they're talking about him

460
00:20:44,720 --> 00:20:48,030
To be honest, at this time, he is probably sure in his head that it is him

461
00:20:48,390 --> 00:20:52,660
That said, it is a comedian who reacts in a funny way

462
00:20:53,550 --> 00:20:55,230
How can I tell from that?

463
00:20:55,220 --> 00:20:57,740
Not a lot of information

464
00:20:57,640 --> 00:20:59,000
Moved again

465
00:20:59,000 --> 00:21:01,710
Gradually moving to the corner of the frame

466
00:21:02,810 --> 00:21:05,380
Is it Abareru?

467
00:21:05,380 --> 00:21:07,240
Ah...

468
00:21:06,250 --> 00:21:08,180
It would have been nice if it was Abareru

469
00:21:07,440 --> 00:21:11,680
It seems not. You're reacting in the wrong way

470
00:21:08,170 --> 00:21:10,020
Yeah

471
00:21:12,080 --> 00:21:15,890
Is that Saito from Jungle Pocket?

472
00:21:15,890 --> 00:21:20,820
Ah, the reaction type, huh?

473
00:21:22,170 --> 00:21:25,190
Since there seems to be absolutely no intention to go to the meeting

474
00:21:23,220 --> 00:21:24,400
He's thinking it's him!

475
00:21:25,660 --> 00:21:28,480
He is called again to remind him

476
00:21:29,550 --> 00:21:34,500
They also have a young daughter

477
00:21:36,250 --> 00:21:38,670
The daughter is still at home...

478
00:21:41,280 --> 00:21:43,310
He hung up straight away

479
00:21:43,310 --> 00:21:44,720
No way, just hung up!

480
00:21:43,880 --> 00:21:44,720
Angry

481
00:21:44,720 --> 00:21:47,320
You can't do that. Call again. Please call again

482
00:21:47,320 --> 00:21:48,390
That's no good

483
00:21:48,390 --> 00:21:50,650
Really no good

484
00:21:48,390 --> 00:21:51,560
Work is waiting!

485
00:21:52,260 --> 00:21:53,760
Is it Degawa?

486
00:21:53,760 --> 00:21:54,630
No, not Degawa

487
00:21:54,630 --> 00:21:56,870
That's right, it really shouldn't be

488
00:21:58,160 --> 00:21:59,200
I feel wrong after saying that

489
00:22:01,730 --> 00:22:04,240
Wow, seems painful

490
00:22:04,030 --> 00:22:07,670
Ogata seems almost completely sure they are talking about him

491
00:22:07,890 --> 00:22:09,470
There's no one else

492
00:22:08,290 --> 00:22:10,170
With the conversation carefully avoiding names for now

493
00:22:10,720 --> 00:22:14,080
After 6-minutes he has reached an almost catatonic state

494
00:22:14,080 --> 00:22:15,430
That's impressive

495
00:22:15,430 --> 00:22:16,950
So at this time

496
00:22:16,950 --> 00:22:18,970
A devastating occurrence

497
00:22:18,970 --> 00:22:21,010
Fill-in-the-blank type hints

498
00:22:21,990 --> 00:22:25,420
The husband, the comedian

499
00:22:25,420 --> 00:22:28,630
He is super bound to her

500
00:22:28,630 --> 00:22:30,260
Bound?

501
00:22:30,260 --> 00:22:32,010
This completely confirms it

502
00:22:30,460 --> 00:22:31,060
Head is buried

503
00:22:31,060 --> 00:22:33,930
Already think "it's me, it's me"

504
00:22:33,930 --> 00:22:35,770
There is no longer any doubt

505
00:22:35,770 --> 00:22:37,000
Its confirmed

506
00:22:37,370 --> 00:22:38,840
That person is particularly excessive

507
00:22:38,840 --> 00:22:41,270
Unlikely to play away, that type

508
00:22:41,270 --> 00:22:43,640
Oh, really?

509
00:22:43,980 --> 00:22:44,990
So

510
00:22:45,890 --> 00:22:48,650
Is that a man like an artist

511
00:22:48,650 --> 00:22:50,950
Excuse me

512
00:22:50,300 --> 00:22:52,400
He talked to them!

513
00:22:52,850 --> 00:22:55,120
Sorry, what you're talking about

514
00:22:53,970 --> 00:22:55,120
Can't stand it anymore

515
00:22:55,120 --> 00:22:56,920
Sorry, are you talking about me?

516
00:22:56,920 --> 00:22:59,490
Eh... eh?

517
00:22:59,490 --> 00:23:00,390
The person you are talking about, its me, right?

518
00:23:00,040 --> 00:23:02,100
An unexpected result

519
00:23:00,390 --> 00:23:01,930
No, no, no

520
00:23:04,560 --> 00:23:07,660
Who would have thought this'd happen

521
00:23:05,250 --> 00:23:08,780
Couldn't help it!

522
00:23:07,770 --> 00:23:10,730
No no no!

523
00:23:10,730 --> 00:23:15,010
No, I want to know...

524
00:23:15,010 --> 00:23:17,470
Who is the director?

525
00:23:17,910 --> 00:23:19,310
No, I just heard about it too...

526
00:23:19,310 --> 00:23:21,380
Who did it come from?

527
00:23:21,380 --> 00:23:22,430
So scary

528
00:23:23,580 --> 00:23:25,850
Is it true?
-I think you've misunderstood

529
00:23:26,220 --> 00:23:27,650
Please tell me the truth, okay?

530
00:23:27,650 --> 00:23:29,350
No no...

531
00:23:29,520 --> 00:23:34,990
Hurry up and go to your meeting!

532
00:23:32,640 --> 00:23:35,440
Its long been forgotten

533
00:23:35,360 --> 00:23:37,390
Starting to interrogate them now

534
00:23:37,390 --> 00:23:40,130
Please tell him "Sorry we have to go to a meeting"

535
00:23:40,360 --> 00:23:42,130
Sorry we have to go to a meeting

536
00:23:42,130 --> 00:23:43,130
Please, before you go

537
00:23:42,130 --> 00:23:44,070
Can't get away otherwise

538
00:23:43,130 --> 00:23:44,470
I just can't accept it

539
00:23:44,470 --> 00:23:47,040
I'm right here, please just tell me

540
00:23:47,040 --> 00:23:47,570
But, I... this...

541
00:23:47,570 --> 00:23:49,540
Its what you're talking about, right?

542
00:23:49,540 --> 00:23:52,010
Sorry, we're being called. We're being rushed

543
00:23:52,010 --> 00:23:53,680
Please wait, don't go!

544
00:23:53,980 --> 00:23:55,010
Sorry, sorry, sorry

545
00:23:55,010 --> 00:23:58,920
Then I'll leave too... I can't take it

546
00:23:58,920 --> 00:24:00,200
Going together?

547
00:23:58,920 --> 00:24:01,450
Don't go, I really can't take it

548
00:24:01,450 --> 00:24:03,150
Sorry!

549
00:24:02,740 --> 00:24:03,980
Going together

550
00:24:06,660 --> 00:24:08,790
Wait a minute, wait for me

551
00:24:09,020 --> 00:24:11,900
The truth is revealed

552
00:24:12,400 --> 00:24:14,700
Calm down a little.
-What's going on here?

553
00:24:14,700 --> 00:24:17,210
Calm down a little

554
00:24:17,210 --> 00:24:19,360
Calm down

555
00:24:22,340 --> 00:24:23,640
Following people isn't right

556
00:24:22,340 --> 00:24:24,510
Poor thing

557
00:24:23,640 --> 00:24:25,180
Do not follow people

558
00:24:25,780 --> 00:24:26,780
What's the program?

559
00:24:27,210 --> 00:24:29,350
You think about it. What do you think the show is?

560
00:24:31,850 --> 00:24:33,350
Wednesday Downtown?

561
00:24:33,350 --> 00:24:34,050
Correct answer

562
00:24:34,150 --> 00:24:36,350
The worst!

563
00:24:36,350 --> 00:24:39,090
This is really unethical

564
00:24:39,090 --> 00:24:42,260
My heart, can you guys come and feel it?

565
00:24:42,260 --> 00:24:44,260
My heart is pounding!

566
00:24:44,260 --> 00:24:46,930
Great! Thank goodness it's not true!

567
00:24:47,830 --> 00:24:49,600
What is this theory, can you guess?

568
00:24:50,830 --> 00:24:53,400
Having an affair will make your heart pound?

569
00:24:53,400 --> 00:24:55,010
There is no such theory

570
00:24:55,510 --> 00:24:57,740
What kind of stupid theory is this?

571
00:24:58,140 --> 00:25:00,710
Great! Thank goodness it's not true!

572
00:25:00,710 --> 00:25:02,710
This is not true, of course, great!

573
00:25:02,880 --> 00:25:05,480
But it's more important to hurry up and get to the meeting, right?

574
00:25:05,480 --> 00:25:07,720
Sorry...

575
00:25:07,720 --> 00:25:10,920
You turned your phone off so there was nothing we could do

576
00:25:10,920 --> 00:25:11,660
I'm really sorry...

577
00:25:12,180 --> 00:25:15,850
So, in first place was Ogata

578
00:25:16,400 --> 00:25:18,360
With over 9 minutes

579
00:25:18,360 --> 00:25:21,830
And probably had no intention to go to the meeting

580
00:25:23,650 --> 00:25:25,270
What do you all think?

581
00:25:25,270 --> 00:25:28,350
Ogata's developed very unexpectedly

582
00:25:28,350 --> 00:25:29,310
Yes, indeed

583
00:25:29,310 --> 00:25:30,850
Ogata's wasn't finished

584
00:25:30,850 --> 00:25:32,640
He followed them out

585
00:25:33,410 --> 00:25:36,750
We should have kept it going

586
00:25:36,750 --> 00:25:38,150
The next theory could have been

587
00:25:38,150 --> 00:25:41,820
How many kilometers will he follow them for

588
00:25:42,010 --> 00:25:45,090
But I have personally heard these rumors about Mrs. Ogata

589
00:25:45,090 --> 00:25:45,790
Eh-

590
00:25:46,260 --> 00:25:47,240
That's a big problem!

591
00:25:47,240 --> 00:25:48,560
There aren't any, right?

592
00:25:48,560 --> 00:25:50,080
Ogata will pursue you!

593
00:25:50,920 --> 00:25:52,900
Yes, indeed
-Constantly following Matsumoto

594
00:25:55,010 --> 00:25:57,570
Let's welcome the next presenter

595
00:26:02,440 --> 00:26:06,740
It's Koyabu!

596
00:26:08,540 --> 00:26:10,480
So let's get right to the point

597
00:26:10,480 --> 00:26:14,090
Does anyone watch Youtube?

598
00:26:14,980 --> 00:26:18,270
The sound is too loud to hear anything

599
00:26:18,270 --> 00:26:20,020
Is there still a ceiling for hearing?

600
00:26:20,020 --> 00:26:22,060
I just hear "bang!"

601
00:26:22,060 --> 00:26:23,860
What do you think?

602
00:26:23,860 --> 00:26:26,560
I will watch comedians

603
00:26:26,560 --> 00:26:28,630
Their online shows
-Yes

604
00:26:28,630 --> 00:26:31,440
I also watch some YouTube channels

605
00:26:31,440 --> 00:26:34,010
Hamada doesn't watch YouTube, right?

606
00:26:34,010 --> 00:26:36,390
Well, i'm the same, I have a look from time to time

607
00:26:36,390 --> 00:26:41,430
To see what other guys who have retired are up to now

608
00:26:42,650 --> 00:26:44,120
That's what you like to watch?

609
00:26:44,120 --> 00:26:47,290
That sort of thing

610
00:26:47,290 --> 00:26:48,780
Social type

611
00:26:48,780 --> 00:26:52,340
What "social type"? He's the "anti social" type

612
00:26:52,340 --> 00:26:56,660
The theory I bring today is about YouTube

613
00:26:56,660 --> 00:27:06,130
No parent would say "Since it's your choice..." to support a child who says "I want to be a trouble-making YouTuber"

614
00:27:10,440 --> 00:27:13,240
What do you think, especially those of you with children?

615
00:27:13,240 --> 00:27:14,820
You won't support it, right?

616
00:27:14,820 --> 00:27:18,680
It's strange, isn't it, to emphasize "troublemaker"?

617
00:27:20,510 --> 00:27:23,020
I'd just want to ask "why"

618
00:27:23,020 --> 00:27:27,120
Imagine your child looking at you with a straight face, what you would say?

619
00:27:27,120 --> 00:27:29,120
Blunt eyes, right?
-Yeah

620
00:27:29,650 --> 00:27:32,600
Since it is your choice...

621
00:27:33,360 --> 00:27:34,930
I don't know if I can say it.
-No, no, no, no, no

622
00:27:34,930 --> 00:27:47,510
No parent would say "Since it's your choice..." to support a child who says "I want to be a trouble-making YouTuber"

623
00:27:48,420 --> 00:27:57,240
The first parent-child pair is Saito and his 18-year old son

624
00:27:56,780 --> 00:27:58,340
I see

625
00:27:57,930 --> 00:28:00,740
The parents divorced shortly after birth

626
00:28:00,590 --> 00:28:02,760
It's been a long time since they saw each other

627
00:28:01,390 --> 00:28:07,650
He lives with his mother in Aomori and is in his fourth year of high school

628
00:28:06,230 --> 00:28:08,290
Some things are better to say directly

629
00:28:08,490 --> 00:28:12,100
It's been a long time since I've seen a live skit.
-Yeah?

630
00:28:12,100 --> 00:28:14,120
It's been a long time since we had a separate live
-Last year?

631
00:28:14,120 --> 00:28:15,890
Yes, yes, nothing since then.
-Ohhhh

632
00:28:16,030 --> 00:28:18,640
Very interesting.
-That's great

633
00:28:18,640 --> 00:28:21,700
No sound at all, my throat was so dry

634
00:28:22,280 --> 00:28:27,650
After a long absence of father and son alone together, Saito speaks in his home dialect

635
00:28:25,450 --> 00:28:28,850
After this they'll start talking

636
00:28:28,490 --> 00:28:33,110
This time to see a live show

637
00:28:33,110 --> 00:28:38,770
Saito is called to the hotel where he was staying on the pretext that there was something important to discuss

638
00:28:39,920 --> 00:28:41,750
What do you want to talk about, then?

639
00:28:41,930 --> 00:28:44,150
I'm in fourth grade now.
-Yes

640
00:28:44,150 --> 00:28:47,330
I just think it's time for me to...

641
00:28:47,330 --> 00:28:50,750
It's time to think about the future.
-Yeah

642
00:28:50,750 --> 00:28:52,990
I want to talk to you about this

643
00:28:53,270 --> 00:28:55,300
With me?
-Yes, yes, yes

644
00:28:55,410 --> 00:29:00,030
If you want to work, you have to come here.
-It's true

645
00:29:00,110 --> 00:29:03,040
So, what I want to do is

646
00:29:03,280 --> 00:29:05,270
Be a trouble-making YouTuber

647
00:29:05,950 --> 00:29:08,070
Straight to the point

648
00:29:08,220 --> 00:29:10,820
Don't, seriously?

649
00:29:10,820 --> 00:29:11,880
Really really really

650
00:29:11,880 --> 00:29:14,180
Are you serious?
-Serious, serious

651
00:29:14,180 --> 00:29:15,380
Why?

652
00:29:15,380 --> 00:29:18,060
You may think that being an ordinary YouTuber is enough

653
00:29:18,060 --> 00:29:20,700
Why don't you be a regular YouTuber?

654
00:29:20,700 --> 00:29:23,430
Why a trouble-making one?

655
00:29:23,430 --> 00:29:25,790
Tell me why you wanna be a troublemaking YouTuber specifically

656
00:29:25,790 --> 00:29:28,530
If you do ordinary things...

657
00:29:28,530 --> 00:29:31,400
There are a lot of YouTubers now, right?
-Yes, a lot

658
00:29:31,500 --> 00:29:35,290
That's why they say, "is this channel like so-and-so's"

659
00:29:35,290 --> 00:29:36,970
But its the same for troublemakers, right?

660
00:29:37,170 --> 00:29:41,070
Has anyone been arrested recently for being a troublemaker?

661
00:29:41,270 --> 00:29:43,510
I don't know. I  haven't seen much YouTube

662
00:29:43,510 --> 00:29:44,710
Haven't seen much?
-Yes

663
00:29:44,880 --> 00:29:48,850
Especially troublemaking YouTubers, I hate them the most

664
00:29:48,850 --> 00:29:52,690
I can't tolerate making money by causing trouble to others

665
00:29:52,690 --> 00:29:55,790
So, to be honest, now I'm very, very shocked

666
00:29:56,310 --> 00:30:01,270
In response to his son's declaration that he would "get into trouble in the future"

667
00:29:57,500 --> 00:30:00,310
A dependable father

668
00:30:02,110 --> 00:30:04,560
Saito is very shocked

669
00:30:02,970 --> 00:30:04,260
Very good, very good

670
00:30:04,710 --> 00:30:07,680
I don't understand. Let's say for example

671
00:30:07,680 --> 00:30:09,200
You're going to do it after you graduate?

672
00:30:09,200 --> 00:30:10,540
No, I think it's fine to start now

673
00:30:10,540 --> 00:30:13,320
Not going?

674
00:30:13,320 --> 00:30:15,340
You're not going to school?
-Yeah

675
00:30:15,420 --> 00:30:18,240
Come on, it's not worth it. I mean it

676
00:30:18,240 --> 00:30:20,050
If it is necessary to do immediately

677
00:30:20,050 --> 00:30:23,220
If you have to do it in Tokyo, I understand completely

678
00:30:23,290 --> 00:30:24,120
What does that mean?

679
00:30:24,120 --> 00:30:29,360
Can I come here after I graduate from college?

680
00:30:29,360 --> 00:30:31,420
I won't support you

681
00:30:31,420 --> 00:30:33,160
I'm saying it straight it up front.
-Ok

682
00:30:33,690 --> 00:30:35,850
To convince Saito

683
00:30:36,620 --> 00:30:42,010
At this point, a specific plan to cause trouble is proposed

684
00:30:42,610 --> 00:30:44,870
For example?

685
00:30:44,870 --> 00:30:46,870
You know that type of exposure fetish?

686
00:30:47,050 --> 00:30:49,710
I'll go out wearing that kind of long coat

687
00:30:50,450 --> 00:30:52,380
Then suddenly open it

688
00:30:52,380 --> 00:30:54,710
But inside i'm actually wearing ordinary clothes

689
00:30:54,710 --> 00:30:56,820
You can just do that as a skit!

690
00:30:56,820 --> 00:30:57,750
I know

691
00:30:57,990 --> 00:31:00,730
Scaring people is bad

692
00:31:00,730 --> 00:31:05,300
Hurting someone is something you can't afford to do

693
00:31:05,300 --> 00:31:07,560
Although there's actually nothing bad going on in the end

694
00:31:07,560 --> 00:31:09,300
Watching from the side might be funny

695
00:31:09,300 --> 00:31:12,970
But from the perspective of the woman

696
00:31:12,970 --> 00:31:14,130
You are scaring her either way

697
00:31:14,130 --> 00:31:16,140
Young women or children, right?

698
00:31:16,140 --> 00:31:18,200
Never do it to children

699
00:31:18,200 --> 00:31:19,810
Absolutely not

700
00:31:20,650 --> 00:31:23,190
The father will definitely be worried about this

701
00:31:24,110 --> 00:31:28,260
Sexual pranks against children is not a good idea

702
00:31:28,260 --> 00:31:32,510
Even if you're not a father, you'd be right to say that

703
00:31:32,760 --> 00:31:35,720
Sorry, I need to reply to an email... Oh, no, a LINE

704
00:31:35,900 --> 00:31:39,090
I'm really worried to hear you say this

705
00:31:39,090 --> 00:31:40,530
What a cut!!!

706
00:31:40,670 --> 00:31:42,710
So boring

707
00:31:42,710 --> 00:31:46,670
But I want to become this troublesome type either way

708
00:31:46,670 --> 00:31:47,530
Hmm...

709
00:31:47,030 --> 00:31:49,150
The son is very strong willed

710
00:31:47,910 --> 00:31:49,570
How about it?

711
00:31:49,570 --> 00:31:50,800
Good or bad?

712
00:31:50,900 --> 00:31:54,010
It's bad, i'm very hesitant

713
00:31:54,010 --> 00:31:56,240
I don't want to see it, and don't support it

714
00:31:57,050 --> 00:32:00,120
Saito said no completely

715
00:32:00,120 --> 00:32:02,770
At this point, we revealed the truth

716
00:32:03,290 --> 00:32:07,450
What? Really!?

717
00:32:07,450 --> 00:32:08,660
What is it?

718
00:32:09,400 --> 00:32:10,860
What do you think?

719
00:32:10,860 --> 00:32:12,360
What is it?

720
00:32:12,900 --> 00:32:16,510
So annoying, I said such embarrassing things

721
00:32:16,510 --> 00:32:20,230
Kid says "I want to be a trouble-making YouTuber"

722
00:32:20,230 --> 00:32:24,240
The theory is that no parent would say "Since its your choice..." and show support

723
00:32:24,240 --> 00:32:26,210
That's for sure!

724
00:32:26,210 --> 00:32:27,940
Who would support it?

725
00:32:27,940 --> 00:32:30,810
I really wanted to beat him up

726
00:32:30,810 --> 00:32:33,610
But I'm divorced and separated again

727
00:32:33,610 --> 00:32:34,750
So its unconvincing

728
00:32:34,750 --> 00:32:36,930
It's great that I was denied

729
00:32:36,930 --> 00:32:39,220
Because I did not expect a refusal to such an extent

730
00:32:39,220 --> 00:32:40,190
That's great. That's really great

731
00:32:40,190 --> 00:32:42,560
For sure!
-From the bottom of my heart, I feel glad

732
00:32:43,040 --> 00:32:47,280
The next parents and children who participated in the verification were

733
00:32:43,370 --> 00:32:45,380
A good kid, actually

734
00:32:48,000 --> 00:32:53,610
KUDOU MIKIKO, an entertainer, and her father

735
00:32:54,410 --> 00:33:01,770
KUDOU went to Waseda University and started to work as a comedian at the same time

736
00:33:01,770 --> 00:33:10,300
But she didn't tell her father about becoming an comedian initially as she thought he would be "absolutely opposed"

737
00:33:11,570 --> 00:33:15,520
A father who seems to be against even "comedy"

738
00:33:15,520 --> 00:33:19,290
What will be his reaction to "trouble-making"?

739
00:33:19,970 --> 00:33:23,260
It's time to consider employment.
-Yeah

740
00:33:23,640 --> 00:33:28,000
I've thought about what I want to do so this is not really a discussion

741
00:33:28,440 --> 00:33:30,140
Informing me?
-Yes

742
00:33:30,380 --> 00:33:31,770
What?

743
00:33:31,770 --> 00:33:36,840
Troublemaking YouTuber...

744
00:33:36,840 --> 00:33:39,680
Want to be?
-Yes

745
00:33:41,550 --> 00:33:43,660
But still calm

746
00:33:42,690 --> 00:33:44,680
Are you serious?
-Yes

747
00:33:44,420 --> 00:33:45,900
Gentle Dad

748
00:33:44,680 --> 00:33:47,740
Is that the "troublemaker" type?

749
00:33:47,740 --> 00:33:53,590
Eating in the supermarket but not paying for the food, stuff like that to attract attention?

750
00:33:53,590 --> 00:33:55,090
No

751
00:33:55,170 --> 00:33:57,600
Will not do criminal things

752
00:33:57,600 --> 00:33:59,570
Are you going to live on this for the rest of your life?

753
00:33:59,570 --> 00:34:01,570
I think its pointless

754
00:34:02,580 --> 00:34:04,290
A bit sad

755
00:34:03,350 --> 00:34:06,740
Is it good for others and society?

756
00:34:06,740 --> 00:34:09,420
That's the reason you want to go for it?

757
00:34:09,420 --> 00:34:10,840
Or is it just because it makes money?

758
00:34:10,840 --> 00:34:15,480
If the audience finds it interesting, it's good

759
00:34:15,480 --> 00:34:17,920
I can't support it

760
00:34:17,920 --> 00:34:23,220
I can't support this kind of thing

761
00:34:23,900 --> 00:34:26,930
As expected, he was opposed

762
00:34:27,800 --> 00:34:29,140
Then

763
00:34:29,900 --> 00:34:35,640
I thought you would support what I wanted to do

764
00:34:36,400 --> 00:34:40,110
Why don't you let go and support me?

765
00:34:40,640 --> 00:34:46,920
Facing the father who does not support her dream

766
00:34:46,920 --> 00:34:48,230
She can't help but shed a tear

767
00:34:48,500 --> 00:34:51,270
This is a bit off

768
00:34:49,760 --> 00:34:53,220
You want to make it your life's work?

769
00:34:53,220 --> 00:34:55,350
Yeah

770
00:34:55,350 --> 00:34:59,090
You only live once.
-Yeah

771
00:34:58,010 --> 00:35:00,080
Dad's heart is softened because of the tears

772
00:35:00,370 --> 00:35:02,400
Well...it's not bad to try

773
00:35:02,400 --> 00:35:05,200
Yes, I will try it

774
00:35:05,200 --> 00:35:12,220
Surprisingly, he reluctantly agrees to her becoming a troublemaking YouTuber

775
00:35:09,690 --> 00:35:11,530
Mixed emotions, right?

776
00:35:13,260 --> 00:35:16,500
At this point, the mother and sister come home

777
00:35:17,370 --> 00:35:22,120
Here, she explains the specific project she intends to do

778
00:35:22,990 --> 00:35:25,550
Isn't there a live camera of Enoshima?

779
00:35:25,550 --> 00:35:30,390
Shooting the beach of Enoshima

780
00:35:30,530 --> 00:35:33,130
The one that was on the weather forecast.
-Yeah

781
00:35:33,130 --> 00:35:38,220
I'll draw a big poop on the beach there like this

782
00:35:38,220 --> 00:35:40,630
Are you stupid?

783
00:35:39,320 --> 00:35:40,370
What?

784
00:35:40,630 --> 00:35:44,700
I'm still trying to decide whether to paint it or write it

785
00:35:44,370 --> 00:35:45,590
Cute project

786
00:35:44,950 --> 00:35:46,840
Painting is better
-Is it better to paint?

787
00:35:46,840 --> 00:35:49,590
Why not draw a dog too?

788
00:35:49,560 --> 00:35:50,990
Making recommendations

789
00:35:49,590 --> 00:35:51,830
Pooping dogs and poop

790
00:35:52,340 --> 00:35:57,250
Eventually, even advice is given from the "troublemaking family"

791
00:35:57,440 --> 00:36:00,170
At this point, we reveal the truth

792
00:36:00,630 --> 00:36:01,540
So bright!

793
00:36:02,400 --> 00:36:04,160
What is this?

794
00:36:04,160 --> 00:36:07,890
Is this a prank?

795
00:36:08,070 --> 00:36:12,470
You'll agree if they want to try it

796
00:36:12,470 --> 00:36:14,330
Well, it can not be helped

797
00:36:14,330 --> 00:36:19,770
If you don't let her do it, she'll regret it, right?

798
00:36:19,770 --> 00:36:22,640
I don't want to give her such regrets

799
00:36:23,450 --> 00:36:28,670
After confirming that the father "wants to support his daughter's dream"

800
00:36:29,080 --> 00:36:32,500
She decides to disclose her comedy activities

801
00:36:32,060 --> 00:36:33,690
Still needs to say this

802
00:36:33,300 --> 00:36:38,790
Comedian
-Want to be?

803
00:36:38,790 --> 00:36:40,460
Would love to be

804
00:36:40,460 --> 00:36:43,560
Now I have an agent

805
00:36:43,940 --> 00:36:47,330
From time to time, I also participate in live events

806
00:36:47,330 --> 00:36:50,540
Really? You've become busy

807
00:36:50,680 --> 00:36:53,170
That I would totally support you in
-Really?

808
00:36:53,170 --> 00:36:54,210
For sure!

809
00:36:55,020 --> 00:36:56,980
Really?
-Funny?

810
00:36:56,980 --> 00:36:59,710
What a fool!

811
00:36:59,710 --> 00:37:03,950
What to do if you don't do what you want to do once in a lifetime

812
00:37:02,880 --> 00:37:05,120
Dad is so nice

813
00:37:03,950 --> 00:37:11,030
Kudou shed tears of joy in the face of her father's tenderness

814
00:37:12,030 --> 00:37:13,390
This technique

815
00:37:13,390 --> 00:37:16,370
First leading with "Troublemaker YouTuber"

816
00:37:16,370 --> 00:37:19,200
Of course you'd be relieved to hear "comedian" afterwards

817
00:37:19,200 --> 00:37:21,130
Being a comedian isn't such a bad thing

818
00:37:21,310 --> 00:37:22,740
Very happy

819
00:37:22,740 --> 00:37:25,570
Have a great pair of parents

820
00:37:26,040 --> 00:37:30,120
Next is Honahonami, who has 2 years of experience, and

821
00:37:29,730 --> 00:37:31,240
What kind of name is this?

822
00:37:30,120 --> 00:37:36,530
Her father, who also doesn't know that his daughter is a comedian

823
00:37:36,530 --> 00:37:37,200
Haven't even told your parents!

824
00:37:37,030 --> 00:37:38,570
Huh?

825
00:37:38,690 --> 00:37:42,020
Getting into trouble, you'll be scolded, right?

826
00:37:42,020 --> 00:37:44,020
And you'll be called a criminal, right?

827
00:37:44,100 --> 00:37:45,790
Won't do criminal things

828
00:37:45,790 --> 00:37:47,990
Then you are really in the abyss

829
00:37:48,480 --> 00:37:52,440
No matter how she tries to persuade, he does not approve

830
00:37:51,200 --> 00:37:52,750
That's for sure!

831
00:37:52,440 --> 00:37:57,000
Being a comedian will be talked about at the point of the reveal

832
00:37:58,250 --> 00:38:03,440
I started working as a comedian 2 years ago

833
00:38:03,820 --> 00:38:08,450
After graduating from college, I want to live as a comedian

834
00:38:08,450 --> 00:38:10,750
This is even scarier

835
00:38:10,930 --> 00:38:12,290
Is it okay? To be a comedian

836
00:38:12,860 --> 00:38:15,760
Well... if you think it's your dream

837
00:38:15,760 --> 00:38:20,490
As long as it does not cause trouble for others, its fine

838
00:38:19,940 --> 00:38:21,810
The standard has dropped a lot

839
00:38:21,130 --> 00:38:24,940
This side also reluctantly agreed

840
00:38:25,420 --> 00:38:29,150
The final parents and children who participated in the validation were

841
00:38:29,780 --> 00:38:36,520
Nichokenju's Kobori and his son

842
00:38:37,490 --> 00:38:40,020
Won't Downtown open a Youtube channel?

843
00:38:40,020 --> 00:38:41,080
No

844
00:38:41,080 --> 00:38:43,130
You can detail your daily lives

845
00:38:43,130 --> 00:38:44,440
Hamada wants to do one about driving his wife, right?

846
00:38:44,440 --> 00:38:46,590
That'd be weird!

847
00:38:46,590 --> 00:38:48,640
There are also couples who drive together

848
00:38:48,640 --> 00:38:49,870
That's crazy

849
00:38:50,370 --> 00:38:51,860
Have you heard?

850
00:38:51,860 --> 00:38:54,160
Well, I heard you have something to say

851
00:38:54,160 --> 00:38:56,500
Here's the deal

852
00:38:56,840 --> 00:38:58,630
What? Whoa, what is it?

853
00:38:58,970 --> 00:39:00,770
Want money?
-Not money

854
00:39:00,770 --> 00:39:02,500
I don't have the money

855
00:39:02,500 --> 00:39:05,440
It is about the future

856
00:39:05,440 --> 00:39:08,240
I found what I wanted to do

857
00:39:08,240 --> 00:39:10,230
I want to talk to you about this

858
00:39:10,230 --> 00:39:12,680
Didn't you say you wanted to be a teacher at school?

859
00:39:12,680 --> 00:39:14,310
Previously, yes

860
00:39:14,590 --> 00:39:18,850
Now I want to be a troublemaking YouTuber

861
00:39:20,200 --> 00:39:22,660
No... eh?

862
00:39:22,660 --> 00:39:24,440
Why do you want to be that kind of person?

863
00:39:24,440 --> 00:39:26,960
Want to be a YouTuber I can still understand a little

864
00:39:27,070 --> 00:39:29,360
Eh? What... uh...

865
00:39:29,360 --> 00:39:31,130
Troublemaker?

866
00:39:31,130 --> 00:39:36,210
Facing a big turn in direction from "education" to "trouble-making"

867
00:39:36,210 --> 00:39:38,350
Kobori is very upset

868
00:39:38,350 --> 00:39:41,370
You'll be scolded and arrested?

869
00:39:41,580 --> 00:39:44,210
I wont do illegal things

870
00:39:44,210 --> 00:39:46,820
It is to get popular by causing trouble

871
00:39:46,820 --> 00:39:48,610
Why do you want to cause trouble...

872
00:39:48,610 --> 00:39:50,220
Why do this kind of thing?

873
00:39:50,560 --> 00:39:52,020
Working as a teacher is good

874
00:39:52,530 --> 00:39:54,850
What is a YouTuber who causes trouble?

875
00:39:55,790 --> 00:39:59,770
Even this trash who is well known for his cheating and debts

876
00:39:59,770 --> 00:40:04,630
Does not approve of activities that cause trouble for others

877
00:40:05,410 --> 00:40:07,600
First of all, why do you want to be that?

878
00:40:07,810 --> 00:40:09,850
Why not? There's nothing wrong with it, right?

879
00:40:09,850 --> 00:40:11,800
You should know...

880
00:40:11,800 --> 00:40:17,760
I've been called "scum" and "trash"

881
00:40:17,760 --> 00:40:21,780
And then my son is causing trouble everywhere

882
00:40:18,000 --> 00:40:19,480
Originally?

883
00:40:22,060 --> 00:40:23,450
I wonder what else will be said

884
00:40:23,450 --> 00:40:25,230
But I just want to do it

885
00:40:25,230 --> 00:40:27,460
First of all, although there are many YouTubers

886
00:40:27,460 --> 00:40:29,390
They don't have love!

887
00:40:29,390 --> 00:40:30,090
No love?

888
00:40:30,090 --> 00:40:31,410
Yeah, those guys

889
00:40:31,410 --> 00:40:32,950
Saying that all you need is popularity

890
00:40:32,950 --> 00:40:36,130
The troublemaker type means you don't care what happens to others

891
00:40:36,940 --> 00:40:40,470
Not funny and no love

892
00:40:40,470 --> 00:40:44,170
This kind of thing ... there is no need to do it

893
00:40:44,350 --> 00:40:47,140
What type of things do you want to do?

894
00:40:47,420 --> 00:40:52,490
Now, some examples of projects are given

895
00:40:53,420 --> 00:40:57,060
For example, if it's related to a comedian
-Yeah

896
00:40:57,060 --> 00:41:02,050
I buy all the tickets of comedian's live show

897
00:41:02,870 --> 00:41:06,660
Then on the day 0 people show up

898
00:41:05,480 --> 00:41:06,930
Very bad

899
00:41:06,870 --> 00:41:08,480
What's funny about that?

900
00:41:08,570 --> 00:41:10,200
What do you think?

901
00:41:10,200 --> 00:41:12,230
Who would find it interesting?

902
00:41:12,230 --> 00:41:15,290
Its a prank to see the reaction of the person

903
00:41:15,440 --> 00:41:19,000
And then does the comedian feel they benefit too?

904
00:41:19,000 --> 00:41:22,160
Its publicity for them too

905
00:41:22,160 --> 00:41:24,280
In the end, it is a win-win situation

906
00:41:24,720 --> 00:41:26,510
There's nothing funny about failure to comedians

907
00:41:26,510 --> 00:41:27,180
Why?

908
00:41:27,290 --> 00:41:30,730
Do you understand the feelings of a comedian when they are pranked like that?

909
00:41:30,730 --> 00:41:32,380
No, I don't understand

910
00:41:32,380 --> 00:41:35,230
YouTubers ignore many rules

911
00:41:35,230 --> 00:41:38,440
They think "it's good to be scolded"

912
00:41:39,440 --> 00:41:40,830
I hate people like that!

913
00:41:41,850 --> 00:41:45,230
He sounds like he's just talking about himself

914
00:41:45,230 --> 00:41:47,150
He's mad at his own company
-Why?

915
00:41:47,150 --> 00:41:49,130
Who are you trying to screw, for example?

916
00:41:50,780 --> 00:41:53,540
For example, COWCOW

917
00:41:53,540 --> 00:41:56,080
No

918
00:41:56,080 --> 00:41:57,710
Why COWCOW... we are the same generation

919
00:41:57,710 --> 00:42:01,450
Because we're the same generation we have a good relationship

920
00:42:01,450 --> 00:42:06,250
That Tada can't take a joke

921
00:42:06,400 --> 00:42:08,890
He's always having a go at me

922
00:42:08,890 --> 00:42:10,600
Tell me to "go and talk about Manzai".

923
00:42:09,770 --> 00:42:11,760
Tada will be furious

924
00:42:10,600 --> 00:42:13,460
Tada takes good care of me too

925
00:42:14,200 --> 00:42:18,950
Kobori does not look like he is going to agree at all...

926
00:42:19,980 --> 00:42:23,640
There are also seniors in the university doing this

927
00:42:23,640 --> 00:42:28,270
They did something over the top and are now super popular

928
00:42:28,520 --> 00:42:32,650
Can earn about 1 million a month

929
00:42:32,650 --> 00:42:35,480
Non-pro?
-Yeah, a million

930
00:42:34,140 --> 00:42:35,810
Interested

931
00:42:35,840 --> 00:42:38,710
Talking about money...

932
00:42:39,260 --> 00:42:42,120
1 million, 1 million

933
00:42:42,120 --> 00:42:45,200
I'll give you half, or more

934
00:42:45,200 --> 00:42:48,030
Half for Dad?

935
00:42:48,030 --> 00:42:49,480
Say you don't need it!

936
00:42:48,580 --> 00:42:51,160
The wind direction has changed

937
00:42:49,480 --> 00:42:51,390
Getting motivated

938
00:42:51,810 --> 00:42:55,730
If I have 1 million a month, I can give you 600,000

939
00:42:55,980 --> 00:43:01,210
College tuition will be paid for, too

940
00:42:58,450 --> 00:43:00,290
Now he's thinking

941
00:43:01,210 --> 00:43:03,780
Of course, I can also supplement the family

942
00:43:03,780 --> 00:43:05,820
Now just 1 million

943
00:43:05,820 --> 00:43:09,110
Doing YouTube, 2 million 3 million is also possible

944
00:43:09,110 --> 00:43:10,720
Eh, want to do it together?

945
00:43:12,160 --> 00:43:14,250
Together?

946
00:43:14,250 --> 00:43:17,260
You have a reputation

947
00:43:17,260 --> 00:43:20,430
You being in it it'll surely be popluar

948
00:43:21,540 --> 00:43:23,710
Eh...
-3 million

949
00:43:23,710 --> 00:43:25,400
What will you do with the 3 million you earn?

950
00:43:24,330 --> 00:43:26,650
Shaken by money

951
00:43:25,400 --> 00:43:32,490
The 18-year-old has lured his father with enticing potential

952
00:43:33,450 --> 00:43:38,120
You can also come up with ideas, it'll surely be popular

953
00:43:38,120 --> 00:43:40,380
In that case, its the same as your comedy, right?

954
00:43:38,960 --> 00:43:41,120
Trying hard to convince!

955
00:43:40,380 --> 00:43:45,550
You're also doing music

956
00:43:45,550 --> 00:43:48,420
Trying to DJ
-Yes

957
00:43:48,420 --> 00:43:49,660
Isn't it the same?

958
00:43:49,660 --> 00:43:54,070
What did Kobori ultimately conclude?

959
00:43:54,570 --> 00:43:56,260
Can't you do it?

960
00:43:56,640 --> 00:43:58,140
Not…

961
00:43:58,140 --> 00:44:00,670
I can understand a little if I am a YouTuber

962
00:44:00,670 --> 00:44:04,570
But causing others trouble and controversy like this

963
00:44:04,750 --> 00:44:07,750
I can't say I agree. Sorry

964
00:44:07,750 --> 00:44:08,840
Disagree?

965
00:44:08,840 --> 00:44:09,810
Disagree

966
00:44:10,350 --> 00:44:14,860
Kobori stopped at the last step

967
00:44:15,430 --> 00:44:17,840
So, the truth was revealed

968
00:44:17,710 --> 00:44:19,620
When it comes to money he almost agreed

969
00:44:21,500 --> 00:44:22,990
What what what what?

970
00:44:22,990 --> 00:44:24,990
Eh, this is fake?

971
00:44:24,990 --> 00:44:26,570
Eh?

972
00:44:26,570 --> 00:44:28,790
You've already got staff?

973
00:44:29,270 --> 00:44:31,630
A team is formed? What's the deal?

974
00:44:32,060 --> 00:44:34,820
At this point, we explained the project

975
00:44:35,540 --> 00:44:37,470
Wednesday?

976
00:44:37,470 --> 00:44:38,640
Theory?

977
00:44:38,770 --> 00:44:41,640
You're working with Wednesday?
-Yes

978
00:44:41,640 --> 00:44:43,540
With Downtown?

979
00:44:43,540 --> 00:44:46,850
Yes, Wednesday Downtown

980
00:44:45,730 --> 00:44:47,400
He's so shocked

981
00:44:46,990 --> 00:44:50,260
Fooled by my own child...

982
00:44:50,260 --> 00:44:56,900
In summary
I want to see what the parents of trouble-making YouTubers are like

983
00:44:56,900 --> 00:44:59,360
Awesome

984
00:45:00,200 --> 00:45:05,010
The examples of troublemaking are still relatively cute and mild

985
00:45:05,010 --> 00:45:08,120
There are also fathers who agreed

986
00:45:08,120 --> 00:45:11,220
If you give bad kind of examples then they will certainly be opposed

987
00:45:11,220 --> 00:45:12,200
Indeed

988
00:45:12,200 --> 00:45:16,690
But this show itself is a trouble-making variety show

989
00:45:18,150 --> 00:45:20,350
If a child says, "I want to be a staff member of Wednesday Downtown"

990
00:45:20,350 --> 00:45:23,000
The parents will certainly be worried

991
00:45:23,000 --> 00:45:24,680
"Are you okay?"

992
00:45:24,680 --> 00:45:27,840
"Can't you just go to a regular variety show?"

993
00:45:27,840 --> 00:46:14,780
