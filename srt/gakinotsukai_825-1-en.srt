Tarai Roulette Battle! (Tarai: Wash basin)

14
00:00:15,580 --> 00:00:16,510
Right, Matsumoto-san

15
00:00:16,580 --> 00:00:17,280
It's come

16
00:00:16,990 --> 00:00:18,420
We can tell what is happening

17
00:00:18,780 --> 00:00:20,420
Yeah, that's right

18
00:00:19,510 --> 00:00:20,170
Umm

19
00:00:20,810 --> 00:00:22,030
There's lot of tarais here

20
00:00:22,420 --> 00:00:23,480
There are 50 of them

21
00:00:23,110 --> 00:00:23,400
That's right

22
00:00:23,480 --> 00:00:24,060
in this room

23
00:00:24,370 --> 00:00:27,340
And out of the 50, if you cut 4 of them, it will fall on your head

24
00:00:27,450 --> 00:00:28,130
Right

25
00:00:28,030 --> 00:00:31,920
And whoever that happens to, does the Batsu Game

26
00:00:29,170 --> 00:00:38,850
Rules

27
00:00:29,170 --> 00:00:38,850
They take turns cutting one of the 50 tarais

28
00:00:29,170 --> 00:00:38,850
if it falls on you, you do a Batsu Game (4 of them will fall)

29
00:00:29,170 --> 00:00:38,850
m 0 0 l 1238 0 l 1239 215 l 0 214 l 0 0

30
00:00:29,170 --> 00:00:38,850
m 0 0 l 287 0 l 287 91 l 0 90 l 0 0

31
00:00:30,840 --> 00:00:31,190
Right

32
00:00:32,340 --> 00:00:36,070
And you know, every week here on Gaki no Tsukai

33
00:00:36,310 --> 00:00:37,810
We do fun things and have a good time

34
00:00:37,940 --> 00:00:42,870
and it's not something I should've saved till now but what on earth are we having to get punished for?

35
00:00:43,060 --> 00:00:44,810
I have N-... O idea

36
00:00:44,810 --> 00:00:46,050
I have N-... O idea

37
00:00:46,440 --> 00:00:50,850
And as usual, if one of Downtown loses, we are spared, right?

38
00:00:48,060 --> 00:00:58,270
Rule

39
00:00:48,060 --> 00:00:58,270
They continue until one of Downtown loses

40
00:00:48,060 --> 00:00:58,270
Worst case scenario: 4 have to do a Batsu game!

41
00:00:48,060 --> 00:00:58,270
m 0 0 l 1238 0 l 1239 215 l 0 214 l 0 0

42
00:00:48,060 --> 00:00:58,270
m 0 0 l 287 0 l 287 91 l 0 90 l 0 0

43
00:00:50,900 --> 00:00:52,660
You're okay with that?

44
00:00:52,200 --> 00:00:54,710
Well, those were the rules when we did the Sushi Roulette too...

45
00:00:55,000 --> 00:00:57,420
So let's do it like that.

46
00:00:57,560 --> 00:00:58,840
Thank you so much

47
00:00:58,900 --> 00:01:01,070
Those are the basics

48
00:00:59,710 --> 00:01:00,530
Yeah

49
00:01:00,700 --> 00:01:03,350
I don't know what you mean by that?

50
00:01:03,350 --> 00:01:04,390
So if I lose first

51
00:01:04,720 --> 00:01:07,160
That means I'd have to do a Batsu game alone?

52
00:01:06,480 --> 00:01:07,580
Yes that is correct

53
00:01:07,710 --> 00:01:07,980
That I will not allow

54
00:01:07,980 --> 00:01:10,950
That I will not allow

55
00:01:09,710 --> 00:01:12,110
What do you mean you won't allow it?

56
00:01:12,380 --> 00:01:14,700
But this program is called Downtown's Gaki no Tsukai Ya Arahende.

57
00:01:14,000 --> 00:01:14,690
Exactly.

58
00:01:14,740 --> 00:01:15,970
So what?

59
00:01:16,030 --> 00:01:19,710
But one of the female juniors I drank with called this program "Cocorico's Gaki no Tsukai"...

60
00:01:19,920 --> 00:01:21,450
There's something wrong with that girl then...

61
00:01:21,430 --> 00:01:31,370
Continue until one
of Downtown loses.
Worst Case scenario 4 of them do a Batsu Game

62
00:01:21,430 --> 00:01:31,370
Tarai Roulette Battle

63
00:01:21,430 --> 00:01:31,370
They take turns cutting strings attached to the tarai
(4 out of 50 will fall on their head)

64
00:01:21,430 --> 00:01:31,370
m 0 0 l 775 0 l 775 138 l 0 138 l 0 0

65
00:01:21,430 --> 00:01:31,370
m 0 0 l 775 0 l 775 775 l 0 775 l 0 0

66
00:01:22,770 --> 00:01:24,480
Tarai Roulette Battle

67
00:01:24,820 --> 00:01:29,400
Out of the 50, 4 will fall. They will continue until one of the Downtown is out.

68
00:01:30,660 --> 00:01:32,620
The order will be as follows:

69
00:01:31,400 --> 00:01:36,480
Endo Shozo

70
00:01:31,400 --> 00:01:36,480
Hamada Masatoshi

71
00:01:31,400 --> 00:01:36,480

Tanaka Naoki

00:01:31,400 --> 00:01:36,480
Yamasaki Hosei

74
00:01:32,600 --> 00:01:36,480
Who will have to participate in the Batsu Game?!

75
00:01:33,290 --> 00:01:35,680
Who will have to participate in the Batsu Game?!

76
00:01:36,640 --> 00:01:38,720
So I have to choose and start now?

77
00:01:37,720 --> 00:01:38,970
You're first

78
00:01:37,730 --> 00:01:38,930
Yeah

79
00:01:39,360 --> 00:01:40,870
But there are some with your faces on it

80
00:01:40,960 --> 00:01:42,390
I know but

81
00:01:42,390 --> 00:01:43,820
That's annoying too...

82
00:01:42,820 --> 00:01:44,960
I want a safe one first...

83
00:01:44,980 --> 00:01:45,720
The first one is...

84
00:01:45,100 --> 00:01:48,610
But you know, I've been in this business for a long time

85
00:01:48,710 --> 00:01:49,710
Doing this kind of thing?

86
00:01:49,030 --> 00:01:51,070
They will have thought about which ones would get them a great shot

87
00:01:50,290 --> 00:01:56,830
It will definitely fall on them in areas

88
00:01:50,290 --> 00:01:56,830
Matsumoto's advice

89
00:01:50,290 --> 00:01:56,830
m 0 0 l 1083 0 l 1083 180 l 0 180 l 0 0

90
00:01:50,290 --> 00:01:56,830
m 0 0 l 1083 0 l 1083 83 l 0 83 l 0 0

91
00:01:50,290 --> 00:01:56,830
which the cameras will get great shots from

92
00:01:50,540 --> 00:01:51,490
I see

93
00:01:50,740 --> 00:01:52,520
They think about that kind of stuff?

94
00:01:51,070 --> 00:01:52,910
I kind of understand that

95
00:01:53,060 --> 00:01:54,520
I didn't know that at all

96
00:01:53,710 --> 00:01:54,650
Probably...

97
00:01:55,000 --> 00:01:55,850
I have no idea about that kind of thing

98
00:01:55,100 --> 00:01:55,650
And

99
00:01:55,980 --> 00:01:57,440
And the danger aspect.

100
00:01:57,430 --> 00:02:02,330
They won't drop it from heights so high it could

101
00:01:57,430 --> 00:02:02,330
Yamasaki's advice

102
00:01:57,430 --> 00:02:02,330
endanger them

103
00:01:57,430 --> 00:02:02,330
m 0 0 l 1233 0 l 1233 180 l 0 180 l 0 0

104
00:01:57,430 --> 00:02:02,330
m 0 0 l 1233 0 l 1233 83 l 0 83 l 0 0

105
00:01:57,820 --> 00:01:59,750
They wouldn't want us to get hurt...

106
00:01:58,550 --> 00:02:01,250
I guess they wouldn't want us to get really hurt

107
00:02:00,840 --> 00:02:02,500
Exactly, that is a factor to consider too

108
00:02:02,500 --> 00:02:03,100
I'm certain the staff here would think about the camera angles more than our safety...

109
00:02:03,100 --> 00:02:03,740
I'm certain the staff here would think about the camera angles more than our safety...

110
00:02:03,740 --> 00:02:06,100
I'm certain the staff here would think about the camera angles more than our safety...

111
00:02:05,070 --> 00:02:05,820
Are you serious?

112
00:02:05,970 --> 00:02:08,310
I just don't know which one is more of a priority for them...

113
00:02:08,420 --> 00:02:09,580
That's true

114
00:02:08,800 --> 00:02:10,610
Come on, guys...

115
00:02:10,000 --> 00:02:11,390
Right then, I'm going for 17

116
00:02:11,540 --> 00:02:32,360
Chosen one

117
00:02:11,540 --> 00:02:32,360
Normal

118
00:02:11,560 --> 00:02:13,800
It's too simple

119
00:02:13,960 --> 00:02:15,930
It's a bit closer than usual...

120
00:02:14,660 --> 00:02:16,260
Even if it fell, it wouldn't hurt that much

121
00:02:16,440 --> 00:02:17,840
Even if this falls on me

122
00:02:18,020 --> 00:02:19,470
It wouldn't be that funny

123
00:02:19,110 --> 00:02:19,940
I see

124
00:02:21,280 --> 00:02:23,780
It won't hurt.

125
00:02:22,050 --> 00:02:23,700
It won't hurt, no.

126
00:02:24,050 --> 00:02:24,880
Number 17 then?

127
00:02:24,940 --> 00:02:26,310
Yes, 17. Here I go!

128
00:02:29,930 --> 00:02:31,520
I'm getting nervous

129
00:02:32,590 --> 00:02:33,480
Scary, scary, scary...

130
00:02:38,360 --> 00:02:39,670
Just as we thought...

131
00:02:39,100 --> 00:02:39,910
It didn't move at all

132
00:02:39,910 --> 00:02:40,650
Come on!

133
00:02:40,670 --> 00:02:41,640
I mean, come on

134
00:02:41,360 --> 00:02:43,390
I honestly thought it was a bit dangerous still

135
00:02:44,200 --> 00:02:47,320
This is about gut instinct, you just got to go with that

136
00:02:45,660 --> 00:02:47,150
That's right

137
00:02:47,350 --> 00:02:48,080
I might go for one with Chiaki on it

138
00:02:48,080 --> 00:02:49,810
I might go for one with Chiaki on it

139
00:02:49,090 --> 00:02:49,890
Are you for real?

140
00:02:49,910 --> 00:02:50,430
I see.

141
00:02:50,430 --> 00:02:51,180
I get you.

142
00:02:51,280 --> 00:02:53,320
Surely not Chiaki.

143
00:02:53,480 --> 00:02:55,500
Wait, can you not say "Chiaki is no good"?

144
00:02:53,490 --> 00:02:56,960
Note: Chiaki wa naiyaro can mean both "Surely not the one with Chiaki on it" and "Chiaki is no good".

145
00:02:55,600 --> 00:02:56,460
No no

146
00:02:56,560 --> 00:02:57,080
What?

147
00:02:56,570 --> 00:02:57,380
You misunderstood him

148
00:02:57,210 --> 00:02:57,700
Endo

149
00:02:57,700 --> 00:02:59,410
I'm her husband, after all...

150
00:02:58,410 --> 00:02:59,560
What?

151
00:02:59,100 --> 00:03:00,340
Don't get so paranoid

152
00:02:59,830 --> 00:03:00,860
I'm her husband...

153
00:03:00,240 --> 00:03:01,340
You misunderstood him

154
00:03:01,020 --> 00:03:03,150
I meant "Chiaki won't fall"

155
00:03:03,160 --> 00:03:05,160
Oh right, if that is what you meant...

156
00:03:07,360 --> 00:03:10,200
If I was one of the staff, surely you wouldn't go there...

157
00:03:10,650 --> 00:03:12,560
But Matsumoto-san...

158
00:03:11,260 --> 00:03:15,170
Oh wait, maybe not, Chiaki is no good...

159
00:03:14,950 --> 00:03:16,030
Why??

160
00:03:16,270 --> 00:03:17,400
I'm stuck now

161
00:03:17,080 --> 00:03:19,220
Oh hurry the hell up!

162
00:03:18,380 --> 00:03:20,510
No, when it's your go, you will understand.

163
00:03:19,300 --> 00:03:22,310
I do.

164
00:03:21,090 --> 00:03:21,630
But

165
00:03:22,220 --> 00:03:23,250
It's still his first go!

166
00:03:22,880 --> 00:03:24,130
I do get that

167
00:03:23,790 --> 00:03:24,320
That's true

168
00:03:24,550 --> 00:03:26,450
I can't choose that one

169
00:03:26,800 --> 00:03:28,450
I'm going for 2.

170
00:03:27,460 --> 00:03:28,220
You're not going for that one?

171
00:03:28,490 --> 00:03:29,120
This one would hurt like hell

172
00:03:28,950 --> 00:03:29,930
If it falls

173
00:03:29,250 --> 00:03:29,870
The gold one...

174
00:03:29,920 --> 00:03:31,010
Oh damn!

175
00:03:30,060 --> 00:03:40,900
Chosen one

176
00:03:30,060 --> 00:03:40,900
Golden

177
00:03:31,920 --> 00:03:33,080
Please fall...

178
00:03:32,170 --> 00:03:33,610
There's still 49 to go...

179
00:03:33,250 --> 00:03:33,770
Please fall

180
00:03:34,050 --> 00:03:34,740
Here I go!

181
00:03:43,140 --> 00:03:44,950
THANK GOD

182
00:03:49,600 --> 00:03:52,130
Damn that's annoying

183
00:03:51,120 --> 00:03:52,220
But you know

184
00:03:52,780 --> 00:03:54,400
I don't know how to approach this tactically

185
00:03:54,280 --> 00:03:55,380
That's true

186
00:03:54,910 --> 00:03:55,530
Yeah

187
00:03:55,960 --> 00:03:57,040
I think I will go for this one

188
00:03:57,330 --> 00:03:59,970
Even if this falls, it wouldn't be funny.

189
00:03:59,710 --> 00:04:00,510
Oh the Wash Basin

190
00:04:00,940 --> 00:04:01,750
I see.

191
00:04:01,590 --> 00:04:21,110
Chosen one

192
00:04:01,590 --> 00:04:21,110
Wash Basin

193
00:04:01,840 --> 00:04:02,810
It's too light

194
00:04:02,900 --> 00:04:04,120
I don't know though..

195
00:04:04,520 --> 00:04:05,610
I did think that too...

196
00:04:05,710 --> 00:04:06,490
That's true

197
00:04:06,480 --> 00:04:07,230
26

198
00:04:07,240 --> 00:04:07,940
He's going for it!

199
00:04:07,710 --> 00:04:08,370
He decided!

200
00:04:08,750 --> 00:04:09,540
Please fall

201
00:04:09,300 --> 00:04:11,310
This one won't fall, surely...

202
00:04:09,760 --> 00:04:10,360
Fall.

203
00:04:11,200 --> 00:04:11,770
Please fall.

204
00:04:11,690 --> 00:04:14,190
Please fall, if it does, it ends...

205
00:04:23,550 --> 00:04:25,380
Damn it, I thought it moved a bit!

206
00:04:31,830 --> 00:04:32,530
Yama-chan, let's go

207
00:04:32,790 --> 00:04:34,220
Hosei-san

208
00:04:33,700 --> 00:04:34,650
Come on...

209
00:04:34,750 --> 00:04:35,870
I'm just going to decide straight away

210
00:04:37,000 --> 00:04:38,120
I'm going for the parachute one

211
00:04:38,220 --> 00:05:09,050
Chosen one

212
00:04:38,220 --> 00:05:09,050
Parachute

213
00:04:38,420 --> 00:04:38,920
For real?

214
00:04:39,080 --> 00:04:40,870
It's too dangerous, it won't fall

215
00:04:40,740 --> 00:04:41,770
You think it's too dangerous to fall from that high?

216
00:04:41,690 --> 00:04:42,640
No way it will

217
00:04:49,630 --> 00:04:50,640
Why did you just laugh?

218
00:04:51,340 --> 00:04:52,830
I thought, "Wow, he's really going for that one."

219
00:04:53,430 --> 00:04:54,580
What the hell are you laughing at?

220
00:04:54,900 --> 00:04:56,600
I thought, "Wow, he's really going for that one."

221
00:04:56,150 --> 00:04:58,100
Why the hell are you getting angry?

222
00:04:58,120 --> 00:04:59,330
Just hurry up

223
00:05:00,320 --> 00:05:00,950
Here I go

224
00:05:01,330 --> 00:05:02,480
32

225
00:05:14,170 --> 00:05:16,400
Damn, it didn't fall after all

226
00:05:17,780 --> 00:05:19,260
I was a bit worried for you too...

227
00:05:19,370 --> 00:05:20,200
Right, let's go Endo.

228
00:05:24,370 --> 00:05:27,140
I had already decided something from the start

229
00:05:26,150 --> 00:05:26,890
Oh really?

230
00:05:27,510 --> 00:05:29,140
I'm going for Chiaki

231
00:05:29,030 --> 00:05:29,710
Just as I thought...

232
00:05:29,210 --> 00:05:52,200
Chiaki

233
00:05:29,210 --> 00:05:52,200
Chosen one

234
00:05:30,280 --> 00:05:31,110
I don't want anyone else saying "Chiaki is no good"

235
00:05:31,110 --> 00:05:34,050
I don't want anyone else saying "Chiaki is no good"

236
00:05:34,810 --> 00:05:36,510
I don't want her name "Chiaki Chiaki" to keep being said by other men...

237
00:05:36,510 --> 00:05:40,190
I don't want her name "Chiaki Chiaki" to keep being said by other men...

238
00:05:39,560 --> 00:05:40,880
This is actually really bad.

239
00:05:40,990 --> 00:05:42,710
27

240
00:05:41,020 --> 00:05:42,830
I don't know about this

241
00:05:44,830 --> 00:05:45,300
Here I go

242
00:05:46,040 --> 00:05:47,000
Trust your wife

243
00:05:47,180 --> 00:05:48,080
Surely not

244
00:05:47,810 --> 00:05:48,680
I'm counting on you...

245
00:05:48,410 --> 00:05:49,760
I don't know about this...

246
00:05:50,070 --> 00:05:51,540
Seriously, I'm begging you

247
00:05:51,820 --> 00:05:52,800
Trust your wife!

248
00:05:53,410 --> 00:05:54,340
Don't betray me, please...

249
00:05:56,140 --> 00:05:57,040
Don't betray me, please...

250
00:05:58,880 --> 00:05:59,800
Don't betray me, please...

251
00:06:07,280 --> 00:06:12,280
Endo! Batsu Game CONFIRMED!

252
00:06:07,780 --> 00:06:09,580
Who would have thought his wife would fall on him?

253
00:06:09,790 --> 00:06:11,900
Endo is already out and is confirmed for the Batsu Game

254
00:06:12,600 --> 00:06:14,230
You nearly chose that one!

255
00:06:14,620 --> 00:06:15,620
You're lucky!

256
00:06:16,620 --> 00:06:17,260
I really do hate the staff here

257
00:06:17,260 --> 00:06:18,160
I really do hate the staff here

258
00:06:18,160 --> 00:06:20,160
I really do hate the staff here

259
00:06:19,460 --> 00:06:20,910
I can't believe this!

260
00:06:19,620 --> 00:06:22,660
When I stood here, their poker faces..!

261
00:06:23,360 --> 00:06:24,660
They hid it so well!

262
00:06:24,310 --> 00:06:26,080
I can't believe this...

263
00:06:26,130 --> 00:06:28,660
Give me a break, man...

264
00:06:28,900 --> 00:06:30,020
I want one more...

265
00:06:30,220 --> 00:06:31,340
But seriously, just a little bit

266
00:06:31,340 --> 00:06:32,500
But I hate Chiaki right now just a little bit

267
00:06:32,500 --> 00:06:35,070
But I hate Chiaki right now just a little bit

268
00:06:35,340 --> 00:06:42,410
Chosen one

269
00:06:35,340 --> 00:06:42,410
Endo

270
00:06:35,340 --> 00:06:42,410
Giant

271
00:06:35,340 --> 00:06:42,410
Normal

272
00:06:35,340 --> 00:06:42,410
Sushi

273
00:06:35,340 --> 00:06:42,410
m 0 0 l 1240 0 l 1240 115 l 0 115 l 0 0

274
00:06:35,630 --> 00:06:39,490
The game that got one of them OUT in its first round: Tarai Roulette.

275
00:06:39,790 --> 00:06:42,180
In the second round, all 4 got through

276
00:06:42,680 --> 00:06:48,020
Chosen one

277
00:06:42,680 --> 00:06:48,020
Skull

278
00:06:42,680 --> 00:06:48,020
m 0 0 l 730 0 l 730 115 l 0 115 l 0 0

279
00:06:42,910 --> 00:06:46,350
And in the 3rd round , Tanaka chose the Skull one and was

280
00:06:46,520 --> 00:06:47,240
SAFE

281
00:06:48,190 --> 00:07:09,340
Chosen one

282
00:06:48,190 --> 00:07:09,340
Normal

283
00:06:48,680 --> 00:06:52,470
Next up, Matsumoto chose one with nothing on it, number 9.

284
00:06:53,450 --> 00:06:55,810
If this falls, I will seriously get so pissed off and snap.

285
00:06:56,200 --> 00:06:57,090
Why?

286
00:06:57,490 --> 00:06:58,680
Why do you have to snap?

287
00:06:59,230 --> 00:07:00,870
I will cut this (mic) off and start cursing so much

288
00:07:00,870 --> 00:07:01,830
I will cut this (mic) off and start cursing so much

289
00:07:01,830 --> 00:07:03,770
I will cut this (mic) off and start cursing so much

290
00:07:03,850 --> 00:07:05,990
Stuff you can't broadcast

291
00:07:05,680 --> 00:07:08,200
Who cares about the mic then?

292
00:07:08,210 --> 00:07:09,140
Since we can't show it on air...

293
00:07:09,610 --> 00:07:16,510
Chosen one

294
00:07:09,610 --> 00:07:16,510
Normal

295
00:07:09,840 --> 00:07:10,430
Here I go

296
00:07:22,910 --> 00:07:24,200
Air Guitar...

297
00:07:23,160 --> 00:07:24,090
He's playing an air guitar...

298
00:07:24,090 --> 00:07:25,170
His air guitar came out...

299
00:07:26,230 --> 00:07:27,780
HAMADAAA!!!

300
00:07:30,960 --> 00:07:32,150
IS HAMADA HERE?!

301
00:07:34,440 --> 00:07:35,850
He's picking a fight...

302
00:07:35,410 --> 00:07:36,250
He's come to fight you...

303
00:07:36,800 --> 00:07:38,930
If the side of this hits me, there would be problems.

304
00:07:36,820 --> 00:07:38,310
That's true

305
00:07:38,620 --> 00:07:39,480
I think...

306
00:07:38,620 --> 00:07:39,480
That's right

307
00:07:40,290 --> 00:07:41,080
That's true

308
00:07:42,220 --> 00:07:43,310
What do you mean "That's true"?

309
00:07:43,310 --> 00:07:45,010
But I'm sure everyone here has at least once in their sleep said "Die, Hamada"

310
00:07:45,010 --> 00:07:45,710
But I'm sure everyone here has at least once in their sleep said"Die, Hamada"

311
00:07:45,710 --> 00:07:48,380
But I'm sure everyone here has at least once in their sleep said "Die, Hamada"

312
00:07:47,610 --> 00:07:48,800
Over the course of 17 years...

313
00:07:48,470 --> 00:07:50,230
Definitely

314
00:07:51,320 --> 00:07:52,620
I've said it in my dreams two days running, twice

315
00:07:52,620 --> 00:07:55,550
I've said it in my dreams two days running, twice.

316
00:07:54,290 --> 00:07:55,570
Man, you say it quite a lot...

317
00:07:55,090 --> 00:07:55,700
In your sleep...

318
00:07:55,770 --> 00:07:56,950
I might go for that one over there...

319
00:07:57,590 --> 00:07:58,790
The one that says "Degree of Risk: 99%"

320
00:07:57,910 --> 00:07:58,870
Degree of Risk: 99%

321
00:07:58,690 --> 00:08:00,930
AN: Degree of Risk: 99%

322
00:07:58,760 --> 00:07:59,260
I see

323
00:07:59,380 --> 00:08:00,850
It looks like a dummy...

324
00:08:00,930 --> 00:08:35,990
Chosen one

325
00:08:00,930 --> 00:08:35,990
Degree of Risk: 99%

326
00:08:01,110 --> 00:08:02,030
But this one...

327
00:08:02,030 --> 00:08:02,930
There are weights inside of it

328
00:08:02,930 --> 00:08:06,430
There are weights inside of it

329
00:08:04,780 --> 00:08:05,860
Weights?

330
00:08:06,130 --> 00:08:06,740
That's amazing...

331
00:08:06,590 --> 00:08:07,900
Are you an idiot?

332
00:08:08,400 --> 00:08:09,970
You'd be so pissed if they were like "Well we did say the risk was high..."

333
00:08:09,970 --> 00:08:10,670
You'd be so pissed if they were like "Well we did say the risk was high..."

334
00:08:10,670 --> 00:08:13,970
You'd be so pissed if they were like "Well we did say the risk was high..."

335
00:08:12,910 --> 00:08:13,900
"Yeah we told you..."

336
00:08:14,110 --> 00:08:15,010
Right, number 6

337
00:08:15,010 --> 00:08:15,480
Right, number 6.

338
00:08:15,760 --> 00:08:16,570
He's chosen it

339
00:08:16,400 --> 00:08:16,850
He's called it

340
00:08:16,940 --> 00:08:18,640
You are an idiot, so die...

341
00:08:18,860 --> 00:08:20,460
You are an idiot, so die...

342
00:08:22,320 --> 00:08:23,110
That's good of you

343
00:08:23,370 --> 00:08:24,810
These 2 didn't say it though

344
00:08:25,820 --> 00:08:26,740
I wanted to but...

345
00:08:27,060 --> 00:08:29,050
You are an idiot, so die...

346
00:08:44,900 --> 00:08:50,170
Chosen one

347
00:08:44,900 --> 00:08:50,170
Normal

348
00:08:44,900 --> 00:08:50,170
m 0 0 l 730 0 l 730 115 l 0 115 l 0 0

349
00:08:45,350 --> 00:08:49,070
Next up, Yamasaki chose 19 and was safe.

350
00:08:50,970 --> 00:08:52,760
Now into the 4th round

351
00:08:53,000 --> 00:08:55,460
Tanaka chose one with an angel on it

352
00:08:53,340 --> 00:09:10,560
Angel

353
00:08:53,340 --> 00:09:10,560
Chosen one

354
00:08:56,100 --> 00:08:56,740
This one surely will be fine

355
00:08:57,190 --> 00:08:58,510
I will go for this one

356
00:08:59,680 --> 00:09:00,310
He chose it

357
00:09:00,390 --> 00:09:01,180
He did

358
00:09:01,830 --> 00:09:03,030
I will be shocked if this one...

359
00:09:03,420 --> 00:09:04,100
That's true

360
00:09:04,150 --> 00:09:04,730
I would be

361
00:09:05,010 --> 00:09:06,590
If this one falls...

362
00:09:07,050 --> 00:09:09,120
It's cute so it shouldn't...

363
00:09:08,580 --> 00:09:09,990
It would be a huge betrayal

364
00:09:09,540 --> 00:09:10,300
I would be shocked

365
00:09:10,070 --> 00:09:10,550
I get you

366
00:09:10,710 --> 00:09:11,460
Like it really would...

367
00:09:11,240 --> 00:09:12,620
JUST GET ON WITH IT

368
00:09:12,650 --> 00:09:13,490
It would mentally...

369
00:09:13,440 --> 00:09:13,920
You're right

370
00:09:13,940 --> 00:09:14,530
Mentally...

371
00:09:14,130 --> 00:09:15,570
I don't want to be betrayed by angels...

372
00:09:14,370 --> 00:09:16,300
Just cut it and let it fall on you!

373
00:09:16,220 --> 00:09:17,340
That kind of thing...

374
00:09:17,570 --> 00:09:25,640
Angels

375
00:09:17,570 --> 00:09:25,640
Chosen one

376
00:09:17,640 --> 00:09:18,650
Fall on him...

377
00:09:19,250 --> 00:09:19,840
Here I go

378
00:09:21,470 --> 00:09:22,220
It'll be fine

379
00:09:23,280 --> 00:09:24,970
I can't imagine this falling

380
00:09:24,750 --> 00:09:25,780
This is going to fall!

381
00:09:25,990 --> 00:09:26,410
I think...

382
00:09:28,780 --> 00:09:29,580
Seriously?!

383
00:09:29,820 --> 00:09:30,340
It didn't!?

384
00:09:29,920 --> 00:09:30,820
I really thought it would

385
00:09:31,140 --> 00:09:31,760
I

386
00:09:33,240 --> 00:09:34,980
will choose the Matsumoto one

387
00:09:36,830 --> 00:09:37,740
Are you for real?

388
00:09:37,400 --> 00:09:38,330
Are you really going for that one?

389
00:09:39,720 --> 00:09:40,760
No, actually

390
00:09:41,370 --> 00:09:42,340
I will go for the Hamada one

391
00:09:42,470 --> 00:09:42,920
For real?

392
00:09:49,330 --> 00:09:50,970
No, that's wrong too...

393
00:09:52,330 --> 00:09:53,760
Oh man, I don't know what to do

394
00:09:54,530 --> 00:09:55,610
This is kind of...

395
00:09:56,380 --> 00:09:57,240
I'll go for the peanuts one

396
00:09:57,540 --> 00:10:17,700
Chosen

397
00:09:57,540 --> 00:10:17,700
Peanuts

398
00:09:57,800 --> 00:09:59,580
Oh I see

399
00:09:58,330 --> 00:10:00,410
You're all going for the decorated ones

400
00:10:00,430 --> 00:10:00,840
Right?

401
00:10:01,810 --> 00:10:04,600
This kind of dajare (bad joke) won't fall.

402
00:10:05,850 --> 00:10:06,420
Even now

403
00:10:06,420 --> 00:10:10,220
It (the joke) is not dropped

404
00:10:11,420 --> 00:10:12,070
Here I go

405
00:10:13,580 --> 00:10:14,360
That was too quick

406
00:10:15,430 --> 00:10:16,570
Go...

407
00:10:25,720 --> 00:10:27,200
So close

408
00:10:30,060 --> 00:10:30,730
Just now

409
00:10:31,150 --> 00:10:32,620
The bottom part touched him

410
00:10:35,560 --> 00:10:37,310
The bit dangling off

411
00:10:37,310 --> 00:10:37,890
Thank God...

412
00:10:38,390 --> 00:10:39,210
I was so scared...

413
00:10:38,620 --> 00:10:40,630
What the hell man...

414
00:10:40,780 --> 00:10:42,890
I honestly thought you were a goner there...

415
00:10:42,120 --> 00:10:43,210
I know, right?

416
00:10:44,840 --> 00:10:45,800
Man, that was...

417
00:10:45,450 --> 00:10:47,030
What the hell man

418
00:10:46,120 --> 00:10:47,980
I want more people to be in this Batsu...

419
00:10:47,270 --> 00:10:48,500
That was...

420
00:10:48,610 --> 00:10:49,230
Let's end it here

421
00:10:50,530 --> 00:10:51,220
You got enough, right?

422
00:10:52,210 --> 00:10:53,770
You got enough content to air...

423
00:10:53,760 --> 00:10:54,760
I'm going for this one then

424
00:10:55,510 --> 00:10:56,260
The Big one

425
00:10:56,470 --> 00:11:16,720
Chosen one

426
00:10:56,470 --> 00:11:16,720
Giant

427
00:10:56,520 --> 00:10:57,120
No way this one falls

428
00:10:57,280 --> 00:10:57,890
Are you for real?

429
00:10:58,480 --> 00:11:00,260
This will definitely fall, I can tell

430
00:11:00,590 --> 00:11:02,240
You chose a great one!

431
00:11:02,740 --> 00:11:04,120
Thank you so much

432
00:11:03,710 --> 00:11:04,910
I'm going to be busy at the end of the year.

433
00:11:04,910 --> 00:11:07,180
I'm going to be busy at the end of the year.

434
00:11:07,010 --> 00:11:07,660
Thank you so much

435
00:11:08,940 --> 00:11:09,870
48!

436
00:11:10,000 --> 00:11:10,600
He said it

437
00:11:11,520 --> 00:11:13,090
It's definitely going to fall

438
00:11:12,770 --> 00:11:13,660
No it won't

439
00:11:14,010 --> 00:11:14,990
2 person Batsu Game...

440
00:11:14,990 --> 00:11:18,590
It would be weird if this one fell

441
00:11:20,550 --> 00:11:21,200
He was right

442
00:11:24,110 --> 00:11:24,720
Oh..?

443
00:11:27,310 --> 00:11:29,110
This is about how to think...

444
00:11:29,360 --> 00:11:34,230
Next up, Yamasaki chooses the high and huge one.

445
00:11:30,170 --> 00:11:43,280
Chosen one

446
00:11:30,170 --> 00:11:43,280
Giant

447
00:11:34,910 --> 00:11:35,770
If that falls, I'd doubt the staff's spirit, seriously

448
00:11:35,770 --> 00:11:36,470
If that falls, I'd doubt the staff's spirit, seriously

449
00:11:36,470 --> 00:11:39,780
If that falls, I'd doubt the staff's spirit, seriously

450
00:11:38,530 --> 00:11:39,810
Doubt their spirit?

451
00:11:40,000 --> 00:11:41,800
I dare you, drop this on me!

452
00:11:43,550 --> 00:11:49,290
Chosen one

453
00:11:43,550 --> 00:11:49,290
Giant

454
00:11:46,650 --> 00:11:47,710
This is scary

455
00:12:02,210 --> 00:12:03,330
Hosei-san, you're safe

456
00:12:03,880 --> 00:12:04,580
You're safe

457
00:12:04,780 --> 00:12:05,480
Hosei-san!

458
00:12:07,040 --> 00:12:07,640
He's making a face like he's just won the lottery

459
00:12:07,640 --> 00:12:09,410
He's making a face like he's just won the lottery

460
00:12:12,010 --> 00:12:17,320
Bumpy

461
00:12:12,010 --> 00:12:17,320
Chosen one

462
00:12:12,010 --> 00:12:17,320
Normal

463
00:12:12,010 --> 00:12:17,320
Normal

464
00:12:12,010 --> 00:12:17,320
Yamasaki one

465
00:12:12,010 --> 00:12:17,320
m 0 0 l 1240 0 l 1240 115 l 0 115 l 0 0

466
00:12:12,060 --> 00:12:14,030
They got through the 5th round fine

467
00:12:14,220 --> 00:12:16,960
And now in the 6th round, it's getting more dangerous for them

468
00:12:17,550 --> 00:12:19,990
I hate this atmosphere now...

469
00:12:20,160 --> 00:12:21,190
I can't take it

470
00:12:20,790 --> 00:12:24,920
They start to say what is in their hearts...

471
00:12:22,350 --> 00:12:23,300
This is so tough...

472
00:12:24,990 --> 00:12:29,130
29

473
00:12:24,990 --> 00:12:29,130
50

474
00:12:24,990 --> 00:12:29,130
Tarais left

475
00:12:29,530 --> 00:12:32,660
What happens if the camera breaks?

476
00:12:31,250 --> 00:12:33,980
I just don't think they'll air footage from a camera like this

477
00:12:31,450 --> 00:12:32,220
Breaks?

478
00:12:32,660 --> 00:12:36,000
Footage from camera

479
00:12:34,170 --> 00:12:37,460
I've been watching the cameras the whole time

480
00:12:37,770 --> 00:12:39,470
They haven't take an angle shot like this once yet.

481
00:12:39,470 --> 00:12:40,810
They want the shot from this angle, as a TV person

482
00:12:40,810 --> 00:12:43,170
They want the shot from this angle, as a TV person

483
00:12:44,350 --> 00:12:45,670
As a TV person?

484
00:12:45,740 --> 00:13:05,860
Chosen one

485
00:12:45,740 --> 00:13:05,860
Video Camera

486
00:12:45,980 --> 00:12:47,190
That's right, and also...

487
00:12:47,580 --> 00:12:50,050
You should have changed the tape on this thing, right?

488
00:12:50,200 --> 00:12:50,820
You did it just before?

489
00:12:52,950 --> 00:12:54,090
And the tape is in good condition?

490
00:12:54,090 --> 00:12:54,390
And the tape is in good condition?

491
00:12:54,390 --> 00:12:56,820
And the tape is in good condition?

492
00:12:56,280 --> 00:12:56,910
What the hell

493
00:12:57,410 --> 00:12:57,970
What the hell

494
00:12:57,700 --> 00:12:58,790
What do you mean "good condition"?

495
00:12:58,980 --> 00:13:00,230
Number 7, I'm going for it

496
00:13:00,290 --> 00:13:01,540
Come on...

497
00:13:01,880 --> 00:13:02,420
No way...

498
00:13:11,570 --> 00:13:13,170
That's what they wanted

499
00:13:12,470 --> 00:13:15,710
They just wanted to get this shot...

500
00:13:13,850 --> 00:13:15,500
Oh I see now!

501
00:13:14,670 --> 00:13:15,820
Oh I get it

502
00:13:21,800 --> 00:13:23,240
Now it's seriously a problem

503
00:13:23,300 --> 00:13:24,240
It is

504
00:13:23,760 --> 00:13:24,660
It really is

505
00:13:24,340 --> 00:13:25,290
It's really a problem now

506
00:13:25,590 --> 00:13:27,040
Only 27 left

507
00:13:26,490 --> 00:13:27,420
Only 27 left

508
00:13:28,170 --> 00:13:29,450
This one is really high as well...

509
00:13:29,460 --> 00:13:30,950
This one is really...

510
00:13:29,890 --> 00:13:31,340
It's really high

511
00:13:30,190 --> 00:13:49,070
Chosen one

512
00:13:30,190 --> 00:13:49,070
High

513
00:13:31,120 --> 00:13:32,390
It's the highest one I think?

514
00:13:32,530 --> 00:13:33,540
It's so high...

515
00:13:32,700 --> 00:13:35,010
If this falls, it's so fucked up...

516
00:13:37,470 --> 00:13:38,150
16!

517
00:13:39,840 --> 00:13:40,560
He's called it

518
00:13:40,300 --> 00:13:41,250
He did

519
00:13:41,120 --> 00:13:41,760
Amazing

520
00:13:42,250 --> 00:13:43,160
Here I go!

521
00:13:46,920 --> 00:13:48,370
This one is dangerous

522
00:13:48,330 --> 00:13:49,970
Come on, fall...

523
00:13:52,750 --> 00:13:53,330
THE WIND!

524
00:13:53,630 --> 00:13:54,540
THE WINNND!

525
00:13:57,340 --> 00:13:58,910
It was just

526
00:14:02,930 --> 00:14:03,690
Hurry up and give me...

527
00:14:05,180 --> 00:14:05,930
Oh man

528
00:14:05,260 --> 00:14:07,440
Man that pisses me off

529
00:14:06,070 --> 00:14:08,870
Wow

530
00:14:09,020 --> 00:14:10,870
That was huge that I got past that.

531
00:14:12,720 --> 00:14:15,530
I've come this far, I really don't want to do the Batsu Game...

532
00:14:16,760 --> 00:14:17,560
Same goes for all of us...

533
00:14:18,940 --> 00:14:21,340
But if I have to do the Batsu, I'm just going to use my money to get out of it...

534
00:14:21,340 --> 00:14:25,110
But if I have to do the Batsu, I'm just going to use my money to get out of it...

535
00:14:25,320 --> 00:14:25,690
My money...

536
00:14:26,960 --> 00:14:28,530
So that you don't have to do the Batsu Game?

537
00:14:31,300 --> 00:14:32,360
I don't think this one will fall...

538
00:14:32,450 --> 00:14:47,330
Chosen one

539
00:14:32,450 --> 00:14:47,330
Small

540
00:14:32,960 --> 00:14:34,140
It's very small

541
00:14:34,680 --> 00:14:35,430
This one won't fall

542
00:14:37,260 --> 00:14:38,260
If this one falls, it's done.

543
00:14:38,470 --> 00:14:38,830
Number 20.

544
00:14:39,880 --> 00:14:40,420
He called it

545
00:14:40,990 --> 00:14:41,560
Here I go.

546
00:14:49,310 --> 00:14:50,620
What the hell!?

547
00:14:53,470 --> 00:14:54,940
We are exactly half way there

548
00:14:55,470 --> 00:14:58,050
I am totally now like...

549
00:14:58,300 --> 00:14:59,450
completely stuck which one to choose

550
00:14:59,620 --> 00:15:00,500
It really starts here...

551
00:15:01,350 --> 00:15:04,050
Why don't you just get rid of that one? (Number 18)

552
00:15:04,050 --> 00:15:07,450
That's so true, mate...

553
00:15:05,160 --> 00:15:07,410
there's a real cutie over here...

554
00:15:06,060 --> 00:15:07,100
And just now...

555
00:15:07,450 --> 00:15:11,220
He spoke down to me a bit there, but sure...

556
00:15:11,800 --> 00:15:13,070
But hold on...

557
00:15:14,160 --> 00:15:17,090
It's really far...

558
00:15:15,660 --> 00:15:16,130
Oh yeah

559
00:15:16,150 --> 00:15:16,520
See?

560
00:15:16,250 --> 00:15:16,750
Oh yeah!

561
00:15:17,090 --> 00:15:18,430
It's to trap people with long arms...

562
00:15:18,430 --> 00:15:19,400
It's to trap people with long arms...

563
00:15:19,400 --> 00:15:20,730
It's to trap people with long arms...

564
00:15:20,460 --> 00:15:20,950
Tanaka you mean?

565
00:15:21,030 --> 00:15:21,600
It's me

566
00:15:21,690 --> 00:15:22,500
It's been set up for Tanaka...

567
00:15:23,030 --> 00:15:24,420
Can you not call me long armed?

568
00:15:24,830 --> 00:15:26,120
It just has a nasty vibe to it...

569
00:15:26,310 --> 00:15:26,860
That one is dangerous!

570
00:15:30,320 --> 00:15:31,100
11!

571
00:15:31,610 --> 00:15:48,830
Chosen one

572
00:15:31,610 --> 00:15:48,830
Normal

573
00:15:31,890 --> 00:15:33,010
He said it

574
00:15:32,450 --> 00:15:33,140
I wonder why

575
00:15:33,200 --> 00:15:33,810
Yeah, why?

576
00:15:33,820 --> 00:15:37,230
When I was walking, I just saw this one looking at me...

577
00:15:38,510 --> 00:15:39,500
Can I go for this one?

578
00:15:39,010 --> 00:15:40,140
I see

579
00:15:39,480 --> 00:15:41,520
This is a revelation of the gods...

580
00:15:42,510 --> 00:15:43,100
Here I go

581
00:16:05,080 --> 00:16:08,550
What kind of revelation is that?!

582
00:16:08,710 --> 00:16:09,820
You're kidding me!

583
00:16:10,490 --> 00:16:11,610
11 is OUT

584
00:16:11,620 --> 00:16:16,550
Yamasaki! Batsu Game CONFIRMED!

585
00:16:12,300 --> 00:16:15,990
Yamasaki, who was chucked by the gods: BATSU GAME CONFIRMED!

586
00:16:16,660 --> 00:16:17,820
You know what though...

587
00:16:17,850 --> 00:16:18,960
Oh yeah, I get you

588
00:16:18,760 --> 00:16:19,810
I'm going for 12

589
00:16:19,600 --> 00:16:22,440
The ones around it will be fine

590
00:16:19,790 --> 00:16:33,440
Chosen one

591
00:16:19,790 --> 00:16:33,440
Golden

592
00:16:20,360 --> 00:16:22,950
It must be

593
00:16:23,500 --> 00:16:24,130
I'm going for it quickly

594
00:16:25,880 --> 00:16:26,500
12

595
00:16:27,340 --> 00:16:27,820
Here I go

596
00:16:36,620 --> 00:16:37,570
Of course

597
00:16:37,430 --> 00:16:38,630
Of course

598
00:16:39,320 --> 00:16:41,060
I might go for the "long-armed" one

599
00:16:39,330 --> 00:16:40,250
Number 18?

600
00:16:41,420 --> 00:16:42,230
18?

601
00:16:41,420 --> 00:16:42,230
18?

602
00:16:42,820 --> 00:16:44,320
That's the one

603
00:16:44,850 --> 00:16:46,320
Actually I'll go for the Matsumoto one

604
00:16:46,980 --> 00:17:06,200
Chosen one

605
00:16:46,980 --> 00:17:06,200
Matsumoto

606
00:16:47,490 --> 00:16:51,250
If I do this one, then the long-armed one, I'll be fine for a while

607
00:16:52,720 --> 00:16:54,430
That's true

608
00:16:53,470 --> 00:16:55,010
What does he mean "for a while"?

609
00:16:55,350 --> 00:16:56,850
I go after him...

610
00:16:56,350 --> 00:16:56,960
I'm going for this one

611
00:16:57,250 --> 00:16:57,890
This one is scary

612
00:16:57,510 --> 00:16:58,100
Right?

613
00:16:58,090 --> 00:16:59,280
Number 23!

614
00:16:59,430 --> 00:16:59,880
He said it

615
00:17:01,220 --> 00:17:02,640
Please, just end this

616
00:17:03,390 --> 00:17:03,970
Just end it here

617
00:17:04,920 --> 00:17:05,860
Ma-chan, end it

618
00:17:06,630 --> 00:17:07,240
Please!

619
00:17:19,120 --> 00:17:20,100
Damn that hurts

620
00:17:20,000 --> 00:17:21,210
I'm fine for a while now

621
00:17:21,850 --> 00:17:22,220
For a while, the Matsumoto-Safe craze will make a reappearance...

622
00:17:22,220 --> 00:17:23,820
For a while, the Matsumoto-safe craze will make a reappearance...

623
00:17:23,550 --> 00:17:24,330
This is...

624
00:17:23,820 --> 00:17:24,260
For a while, the Matsumoto-safe craze  will make a reappearance...

625
00:17:24,260 --> 00:17:25,990
For a while, the Matsumoto-safe craze will make a reappearance...

626
00:17:24,890 --> 00:17:26,730
Your favourite number is still available, Hamada-san

627
00:17:26,760 --> 00:17:29,660
A reappearance!

628
00:17:27,120 --> 00:17:27,840
That's true

629
00:17:29,300 --> 00:17:30,320
That one is for you...

630
00:17:30,580 --> 00:17:31,770
I'm going near the back

631
00:17:32,550 --> 00:17:34,480
That's true, none of these have been cut

632
00:17:33,100 --> 00:17:34,490
None of them

633
00:17:34,390 --> 00:17:35,050
That's true

634
00:17:35,690 --> 00:17:37,050
There's still one small one

635
00:17:37,640 --> 00:17:38,120
Mini one

636
00:17:38,300 --> 00:17:39,020
This won't fall

637
00:17:39,670 --> 00:17:51,250
Chosen one

638
00:17:39,670 --> 00:17:51,250
Small

639
00:17:39,960 --> 00:17:40,600
Number 45

640
00:17:40,630 --> 00:17:41,720
He called it

641
00:17:42,290 --> 00:17:43,340
Please, let's keep going...

642
00:17:44,680 --> 00:17:45,210
Here I go

643
00:17:45,920 --> 00:17:46,950
Please...

644
00:17:46,980 --> 00:17:47,550
Fall...

645
00:17:47,680 --> 00:17:48,440
We're going to keep going

646
00:17:54,300 --> 00:17:55,150
Damn, man

647
00:17:54,710 --> 00:17:56,140
You are so good at this...

648
00:17:55,400 --> 00:17:56,790
Damn, man...

649
00:17:56,320 --> 00:17:57,930
And they keep going

650
00:17:57,960 --> 00:18:03,260
Bumpy

651
00:17:57,960 --> 00:18:03,260
Chosen one

652
00:17:57,960 --> 00:18:03,260
Normal

653
00:17:57,960 --> 00:18:03,260
Normal

654
00:17:57,960 --> 00:18:03,260
m 0 0 l 1240 0 l 1240 115 l 0 115 l 0 0

655
00:17:58,420 --> 00:18:01,860
We are coming to the end of the battle

656
00:18:03,530 --> 00:18:08,900
Chosen one

657
00:18:03,530 --> 00:18:08,900
Long Arm

658
00:18:03,530 --> 00:18:08,900
Normal

659
00:18:03,530 --> 00:18:08,900

661
00:18:04,140 --> 00:18:08,210
The 3 get through Round 8 and 9 safely

662
00:18:09,390 --> 00:18:12,800
And on the 10th round, the one Tanaka chose was...

663
00:18:13,570 --> 00:18:21,650
Chosen one

664
00:18:13,570 --> 00:18:21,650
Normal

665
00:18:13,650 --> 00:18:14,360
43

666
00:18:14,760 --> 00:18:15,360
I'm calling it

667
00:18:17,830 --> 00:18:18,360
I'm counting on you!

668
00:18:25,640 --> 00:18:26,320
You're good at this

669
00:18:26,850 --> 00:18:27,740
Tanaka is good at this!

670
00:18:28,250 --> 00:18:40,630
Away from rest

671
00:18:28,250 --> 00:18:40,630
Chosen one

672
00:18:28,340 --> 00:18:29,570
Surely...

673
00:18:28,420 --> 00:18:29,760
Surely not this one...

674
00:18:29,780 --> 00:18:33,910
Here, Matsumoto chooses number 49, far away from the others

675
00:18:34,370 --> 00:18:35,000
Here I go

676
00:18:42,870 --> 00:18:43,430
Nope

677
00:18:46,200 --> 00:18:47,820
Damn

678
00:18:46,940 --> 00:18:48,600
As I thought, this one was fine

679
00:18:49,590 --> 00:18:52,560
Next up, Hamada chooses Number 39, a small one

680
00:18:53,640 --> 00:19:18,600
Chosen one

681
00:18:53,640 --> 00:19:18,600
Small

682
00:18:53,810 --> 00:18:54,340
39

683
00:18:54,870 --> 00:18:55,710
This is the last

684
00:18:55,880 --> 00:18:56,430
mini one?

685
00:18:56,820 --> 00:18:57,330
Fall...

686
00:18:57,830 --> 00:18:58,660
It won't

687
00:19:01,060 --> 00:19:01,950
It won't fall

688
00:19:02,080 --> 00:19:03,090
He's hesitating...

689
00:19:03,210 --> 00:19:04,430
He did

690
00:19:03,700 --> 00:19:05,720
He is totally hesitating right now

691
00:19:05,860 --> 00:19:09,430
The gods of the wash basins are now just...

692
00:19:21,200 --> 00:19:22,970
Amazing

693
00:19:22,140 --> 00:19:24,050
So, all the minis were safe

694
00:19:24,220 --> 00:19:25,520
Mini wash basins were fine, eh?

695
00:19:25,880 --> 00:19:27,160
Already, the two of you are out.

696
00:19:25,940 --> 00:19:31,080
13

697
00:19:25,940 --> 00:19:31,080

699
00:19:26,870 --> 00:19:27,720
I don't know...

700
00:19:31,640 --> 00:19:33,310
It's mine, so I'm going to choose it

701
00:19:33,340 --> 00:19:34,000
Fantastic choice

702
00:19:33,480 --> 00:19:47,670
Chosen one

703
00:19:33,480 --> 00:19:47,670
Tanaka

704
00:19:34,540 --> 00:19:35,750
So this one falls on you

705
00:19:36,240 --> 00:19:38,890
Then Matsumoto have one fall on him and we can just end it right there...

706
00:19:39,040 --> 00:19:39,520
Seriously

707
00:19:40,480 --> 00:19:41,050
25

708
00:19:41,450 --> 00:19:41,900
Here I go

709
00:19:51,250 --> 00:19:52,240
What the hell!?

710
00:19:55,270 --> 00:19:59,780
12

711
00:19:55,270 --> 00:19:59,780

713
00:19:55,450 --> 00:19:58,050
This is getting really hard now

714
00:19:58,450 --> 00:19:59,640
12 left...

715
00:19:59,990 --> 00:20:01,740
If I can get this one...

716
00:20:03,010 --> 00:20:09,700
There's a huge probability Hamada will get it, so it's a chance in a way...

717
00:20:10,250 --> 00:20:11,420
So I have to get past this...

718
00:20:11,420 --> 00:20:12,460
So I have to get past this...

719
00:20:12,460 --> 00:20:16,130
We can't have that...

720
00:20:15,070 --> 00:20:15,870
Hurry up and stand up

721
00:20:18,060 --> 00:20:23,070
The fear of the Batsu rings in their brains...

722
00:20:19,440 --> 00:20:22,230
The fear of the Batsu rings in their brains...

723
00:20:23,330 --> 00:20:26,440
Matsumoto

724
00:20:23,640 --> 00:20:26,340
Will the person who has to do the Batsu Game be Matsumoto?

725
00:20:26,600 --> 00:20:30,010
Or Hamada?

726
00:20:26,760 --> 00:20:29,720
Or Hamada? Only the gods know...

727
00:20:33,640 --> 00:20:35,700
I'm going to go for the dolls OVER HERE!!

728
00:20:35,760 --> 00:20:36,640
He's going for it

729
00:20:37,650 --> 00:20:52,560
Chosen one

730
00:20:37,650 --> 00:20:52,560
Dolls

731
00:20:38,960 --> 00:20:40,660
I don't think this one will fall

732
00:20:40,990 --> 00:20:43,350
Come on, please fall, enough now

733
00:20:41,780 --> 00:20:43,330
Come on...

734
00:20:43,830 --> 00:20:45,330
35, here I go!

735
00:20:46,020 --> 00:20:46,830
He's called it

736
00:20:46,480 --> 00:20:47,270
He has

737
00:20:49,810 --> 00:20:50,750
Please, seriously

738
00:20:50,420 --> 00:20:51,210
Please...

739
00:20:51,250 --> 00:20:52,210
Just fall

740
00:21:00,130 --> 00:21:02,950
He's still safe...

741
00:21:01,940 --> 00:21:04,920
Amazing, he's still alive...

742
00:21:05,540 --> 00:21:08,390
This really hurts me...

00:21:09,430 --> 00:21:11,540
I should be safe, for sure

747
00:21:12,450 --> 00:21:13,020
What if I go for the one with my face on it...

748
00:21:13,020 --> 00:21:15,520
What if I go for the one with my face on it...

749
00:21:15,730 --> 00:21:22,800
I don't know if they will think 'he'll definitely get through a few rounds so leave one with his face on it'...

750
00:21:23,540 --> 00:21:25,400
And 21 looks way too "normal"...

751
00:21:26,970 --> 00:21:28,410
You know what, I'm going for my own one

752
00:21:28,900 --> 00:22:04,570
Chosen one

753
00:21:28,900 --> 00:22:04,570
Hamada

754
00:21:30,880 --> 00:21:32,080
You're going for it now?

755
00:21:32,430 --> 00:21:33,410
I will

756
00:21:34,510 --> 00:21:35,110
I was very close to going for the Hamada one

757
00:21:35,110 --> 00:21:37,240
I was very close to going for the Hamada one

758
00:21:37,240 --> 00:21:40,510
I stopped myself just as I was about to call it...

759
00:21:42,800 --> 00:21:43,390
Right, I'm going for it

760
00:21:44,780 --> 00:21:46,900
I'll be fine, the one that falls

761
00:21:47,370 --> 00:21:50,980
cannot be the one with my face

762
00:21:51,450 --> 00:21:53,060
Surely they wouldn't do something that rude...

763
00:21:53,200 --> 00:21:54,960
That would be very rude of them...

764
00:21:55,330 --> 00:21:56,750
Seriously, enough. I'm done with this.

765
00:21:55,710 --> 00:21:57,310
Please

766
00:21:57,730 --> 00:21:58,480
Seriously

767
00:21:58,730 --> 00:21:59,310
Here I go!

768
00:22:22,550 --> 00:22:25,330
Hamada! BATSU GAME!

769
00:22:25,090 --> 00:22:30,690
Hamada! BATSU GAME CONFIRMED!

770
00:22:28,900 --> 00:22:30,830
It's been decided!!

771
00:22:29,290 --> 00:22:30,870
Wow...

772
00:22:32,400 --> 00:22:33,710
Jeez

773
00:22:34,000 --> 00:22:36,220
The staff must have really thought about it...

774
00:22:35,900 --> 00:22:37,260
And this is the result

775
00:22:37,720 --> 00:22:38,770
That was deep!

776
00:22:38,770 --> 00:22:39,470
It really was

777
00:22:39,900 --> 00:22:40,670
So... how much have I got to pay to get out of this?

778
00:22:40,670 --> 00:22:42,740
So... how much have I got to pay to get out of this?

779
00:22:42,960 --> 00:22:43,630
You can't do that...

780
00:22:43,880 --> 00:22:45,290
He was saying before he would use his money to...

781
00:22:45,010 --> 00:22:46,470
No no no, you cannot do that

782
00:22:45,500 --> 00:22:47,340
No...

783
00:22:46,670 --> 00:22:48,720
Thank God!

784
00:22:48,340 --> 00:22:52,920
That's the worst, man; God, I'm pissed!

785
00:22:52,860 --> 00:22:54,670
Just wondering but which other one would have fallen?

786
00:22:54,400 --> 00:22:56,800
Which one?

787
00:22:55,260 --> 00:22:56,220
Which one?

788
00:22:56,580 --> 00:22:57,630
44?

789
00:22:57,970 --> 00:22:58,710
Oh that one!

790
00:22:58,760 --> 00:22:59,130
That big one

791
00:22:59,810 --> 00:23:01,250
Oh I see

792
00:23:00,250 --> 00:23:02,200
I would have been okay still then.

793
00:23:02,880 --> 00:23:04,100
Damn...

794
00:23:03,520 --> 00:23:05,310
Great work, Great work-chan!

795
00:23:07,440 --> 00:23:08,380
It's Instant Johnson...

796
00:23:08,220 --> 00:23:09,460
You smug son of a...
