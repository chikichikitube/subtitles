00:00:21,220 --> 00:00:25,760
Why does it aways have to be here?

Do you have boyfriend?
- Dokuro-san, he's calling you!

11
00:00:41,460 --> 00:00:45,180
Can we go out? Ouch!
- Dokuro-san, It's for you.

12
00:00:46,080 --> 00:00:51,500
Why do you have to slap my face?
- Dokuro-san, there, he's knocking.

Ladies run! Now!
- Thank you.

23
00:01:39,740 --> 00:01:50,200
Sit your ass down! Sit! Sit, sit!

24
00:01:53,440 --> 00:01:55,700
You won't get away with this! Not today!

25
00:01:57,160 --> 00:01:57,860
Sit!

26
00:01:59,120 --> 00:02:01,240
Let's just take a good look at you!
Ony by one!

27
00:02:03,500 --> 00:02:06,020
You, who are you supposed to be?
- Blue Rangai!

28
00:02:06,020 --> 00:02:09,340
This is not blue!
Does this look blue to you!?

29
00:02:11,300 --> 00:02:13,720
That's blue and that's blue ant this is...

30
00:02:15,640 --> 00:02:18,580
You! - Red Rangai!
- Why  are you wearing sleeveless top?

31
00:02:22,000 --> 00:02:28,180
Tell me. - This is... more... hip.

32
00:02:29,720 --> 00:02:31,120
Dumb ass.

33
00:02:32,000 --> 00:02:36,720
Hey! - Yes.
What do you think you are? - Pink Rangai!

34
00:02:37,100 --> 00:02:40,280
Why are you acting like a woman?
- Pink Rangai!

35
00:02:41,580 --> 00:02:46,540
You, you don't even come closer.
You are simply out of question.

36
00:02:48,320 --> 00:02:51,880
Let me... - You better find another job.
- Please let me explain.

37
00:02:52,160 --> 00:02:57,300
I may appear to be Tiger Mask.
But I'm Yellow Rangai at heart.

38
00:02:59,600 --> 00:03:00,580
Hey!

39
00:03:03,380 --> 00:03:04,900
Mrs.

40
00:03:06,240 --> 00:03:07,200
You!

41
00:03:13,120 --> 00:03:20,040
This is not even a costume.
No transformation at all.

42
00:03:22,420 --> 00:03:27,740
I definitely have in my mind that...
I should wear something... green.

43
00:03:28,120 --> 00:03:31,480
And... - Uh-huh.
- And this was the best I could find.

44
00:03:33,040 --> 00:03:39,180
I don't need it!
What the hell are you thinking?

45
00:03:41,060 --> 00:03:45,500
You don't look like a hero at all!
you are just a waitress!

46
00:03:46,800 --> 00:03:49,620
But I really tried...
- Don't take my rod.

47
00:03:51,720 --> 00:03:54,620
I don't know what to do anymore.
You're always critical...

48
00:03:54,620 --> 00:03:57,540
You are supposed to be blue.
Zip up!

49
00:03:59,740 --> 00:04:02,160
You came very close this time.
- I did?

50
00:04:02,160 --> 00:04:07,740
If your top isn't sleeveless.
What made you think of taking it off?

51
00:04:07,900 --> 00:04:11,260
I thought this is more...
- You have to protect your skin.

52
00:04:11,260 --> 00:04:13,260
Don't even think about it.

53
00:04:15,900 --> 00:04:22,220
Longer sleeves doesn't improve nothing.
I said I don't need it!

54
00:04:24,060 --> 00:04:26,400
But I really...
- Don't take this!

55
00:04:28,720 --> 00:04:31,400
I'm really at loss what to do.

56
00:04:31,400 --> 00:04:37,860
I can understand what these 3 of you
are trying to do.

57
00:04:40,920 --> 00:04:42,900
Seriously, I think you guys
should dump him.

58
00:04:44,480 --> 00:04:47,720
There has to be 5 of us.
And it's not like I'm not motivated.

59
00:04:47,720 --> 00:04:55,360
I know I don't have what it takes.
I mean, I want to do some other...

60
00:04:56,840 --> 00:04:58,620
You aren't making any sense.

61
00:04:58,740 --> 00:05:04,740
I just don't follow you. But I assume
you have your own idea about a hero.

62
00:05:04,740 --> 00:05:10,320
You have that, don't you?
That's why you're in those costumes, right?

63
00:05:10,600 --> 00:05:18,980
Ok. Come back next week with costumes
tha you think a hero would wear. - Yes.

64
00:05:18,980 --> 00:05:28,580
I promise I won't nag you.
You do it in your way, ok? - Fine.

65
00:05:28,780 --> 00:05:32,960
Let me see what's your
notion of a hero. - Ok.

66
00:05:32,960 --> 00:05:34,420
We'll do this step by step

67
00:05:34,420 --> 00:05:41,960
No need to rush. - I understand.
-  Thank you very much.

68
00:05:42,300 --> 00:05:44,800
You can go now.
Put these away.

69
00:05:49,300 --> 00:05:50,920
We are sorry to cause you trouble.

70
00:05:51,440 --> 00:05:55,280
See you guys next week. 8:30.
- Thank you. - Goodbye

71
00:05:55,700 --> 00:05:58,260
I'll be waiting for you.

72
00:06:00,920 --> 00:06:02,440
Take care.
- I will.

73
00:06:04,720 --> 00:06:09,640
Good night !
- I'm leaving now.
