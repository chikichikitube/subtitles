1
00:00:07,820 --> 00:00:10,660
Watch your step.

2
00:00:15,730 --> 00:00:17,620
Are you okay?

3
00:00:17,620 --> 00:00:19,730
Take it slow, take it slow.

4
00:00:27,240 --> 00:00:30,710
Hakamada Law Office

5
00:00:30,710 --> 00:00:35,180
Hakamada Law Office

6
00:00:35,180 --> 00:00:37,640
I won chocolate at pachinko. Want some?

7
00:00:37,640 --> 00:00:39,370
Sure.

8
00:00:39,370 --> 00:00:41,180
I want some, too.

9
00:00:41,180 --> 00:00:43,520
Say, Kanae-chan, wanna go
get a drink together?

10
00:00:43,650 --> 00:00:46,890
Assistant of Hakamada
Nonomura Kanae

11
00:00:44,300 --> 00:00:45,880
It's only four o'clock.

12
00:00:45,880 --> 00:00:47,090
I'm still working.

13
00:00:47,090 --> 00:00:49,720
Temp
Shinozuka Rina

14
00:00:47,090 --> 00:00:49,730
I don't think anyone
will show up this late.

15
00:00:51,340 --> 00:00:53,330
Maybe we should invite Sensei, too.

16
00:00:53,860 --> 00:00:56,670
He doesn't drink, though.

17
00:00:56,670 --> 00:00:59,290
He'd be no fun at all if he came along.

18
00:01:00,560 --> 00:01:04,770
I wonder what he does for fun.

19
00:01:04,770 --> 00:01:06,510
Making bread, for sure.

20
00:01:06,510 --> 00:01:08,240
He once said to me, completely serious,

21
00:01:06,640 --> 00:01:10,050
Attorney
Hakamada Yukio

22
00:01:08,240 --> 00:01:11,310
"Flour is my lover."

23
00:01:11,310 --> 00:01:15,180
His relationship with his lover
isn't making any progress.

24
00:01:11,450 --> 00:01:13,980
Office landlord
Toyama Yoshie

25
00:01:15,180 --> 00:01:18,390
I wonder why Sensei never got married?

26
00:01:18,390 --> 00:01:22,530
After all, he's a lawyer,
he's tall, and his looks...

27
00:01:22,530 --> 00:01:25,020
Well, they aren't too bad.

28
00:01:25,020 --> 00:01:28,100
You should marry him, then, Kanae-chan.

29
00:01:28,100 --> 00:01:29,570
What?

30
00:01:29,570 --> 00:01:30,930
Impossible, impossible.

31
00:01:30,930 --> 00:01:32,270
No way, no way!

32
00:01:32,270 --> 00:01:33,790
No way!

33
00:01:33,790 --> 00:01:35,370
What's impossible?

34
00:01:35,370 --> 00:01:38,610
What? Oh, nothing.

35
00:01:38,970 --> 00:01:40,910
Excuse me.

36
00:01:41,340 --> 00:01:43,410
Are you here for legal counseling?

37
00:01:43,410 --> 00:01:46,110
I don't have an appointment.
Is that okay?

38
00:01:43,410 --> 00:01:46,110
This episode's client
Suwa Natsuki

39
00:01:46,110 --> 00:01:46,700
Yes!

40
00:01:46,700 --> 00:01:48,170
No problem at all!

41
00:01:48,170 --> 00:01:50,990
Sensei's schedule has been
empty for the past three days.

42
00:01:50,990 --> 00:01:52,220
Too much information.

43
00:01:52,220 --> 00:01:53,350
Please, this way.

44
00:01:53,350 --> 00:01:54,720
Sensei, we have a client.

45
00:01:54,720 --> 00:01:55,260
Yes.

46
00:01:55,930 --> 00:01:56,940
Sensei, get tea!

47
00:01:56,940 --> 00:01:57,990
Yes.

48
00:02:01,820 --> 00:02:02,850
Please.

49
00:02:02,850 --> 00:02:03,700
Thank you very much.

50
00:02:03,700 --> 00:02:07,240
Please tell me about
why you're here today.

51
00:02:09,110 --> 00:02:10,690
My father...

52
00:02:12,550 --> 00:02:14,510
is being deceived.

53
00:02:15,350 --> 00:02:16,770
And how is that?

54
00:02:17,140 --> 00:02:19,710
My mother passed away
about three years ago.

55
00:02:19,710 --> 00:02:24,670
My father remarried a year
after that, to Chika-san.

56
00:02:25,220 --> 00:02:27,720
I am financially independent.

57
00:02:27,720 --> 00:02:31,010
Who my father marries doesn't affect me...

58
00:02:31,490 --> 00:02:32,880
But...

59
00:02:32,880 --> 00:02:35,730
Chika-san is younger than me.

60
00:02:37,150 --> 00:02:38,470
What are their ages?

61
00:02:38,470 --> 00:02:45,100
Chika-san is 27, my father is 72.

62
00:02:45,100 --> 00:02:48,450
So she's 45 years his junior.

63
00:02:48,990 --> 00:02:51,340
I'm jealous.

64
00:02:51,340 --> 00:02:55,280
I want to be with a younger man, too.

65
00:02:55,280 --> 00:02:57,520
Don't butt in, you two!

66
00:02:57,900 --> 00:03:02,960
However, I suspect Chika-san
married my father for his money.

67
00:03:02,960 --> 00:03:04,320
Why do you suspect that?

68
00:03:04,320 --> 00:03:07,570
Chika-san buys brand-name
goods almost daily.

69
00:03:07,570 --> 00:03:10,200
She goes on weekend
trips with her friends,

70
00:03:10,200 --> 00:03:12,330
leaving my father behind.

71
00:03:12,330 --> 00:03:15,280
Of course my father pays for them.

72
00:03:16,110 --> 00:03:19,020
It's been approximately two years
since they were married...

73
00:03:19,020 --> 00:03:22,220
But I believe he's spent at least
30 million yen on her in that time.

74
00:03:22,220 --> 00:03:23,730
30 million...

75
00:03:23,730 --> 00:03:26,640
Your father must be rich.

76
00:03:26,640 --> 00:03:28,860
He's retired now,

77
00:03:28,860 --> 00:03:31,720
but he ran his own
civil engineering firm.

78
00:03:31,720 --> 00:03:33,140
I see.

79
00:03:33,140 --> 00:03:34,640
So in other words, Natsuki-san,

80
00:03:34,640 --> 00:03:36,520
you want your father to get a divorce.

81
00:03:36,520 --> 00:03:37,430
No.

82
00:03:37,430 --> 00:03:40,860
She's already begun
the divorce process.

83
00:03:40,860 --> 00:03:42,760
The wife?

84
00:03:42,760 --> 00:03:46,020
She is suing for five million
yen in compensation.

85
00:03:46,020 --> 00:03:47,230
Five million?

86
00:03:47,770 --> 00:03:48,820
On what grounds?

87
00:03:48,820 --> 00:03:52,010
She insists my father
is cheating on her.

88
00:03:52,010 --> 00:03:53,870
She has evidence, as well.

89
00:03:57,790 --> 00:04:02,060
Caught red-handed.

90
00:04:02,060 --> 00:04:06,300
Occasionally, there are old men
in their seventies who are still feisty.

91
00:04:06,920 --> 00:04:08,580
But, don't worry.

92
00:04:08,580 --> 00:04:10,450
Despite his looks,

93
00:04:10,450 --> 00:04:12,980
Sensei's a specialist when it
comes to compensation lawsuitsãƒ¼

94
00:04:12,980 --> 00:04:14,910
I am sorry to say,

95
00:04:14,910 --> 00:04:17,110
but I must refuse this case.

96
00:04:18,620 --> 00:04:19,760
Why is that?

97
00:04:19,760 --> 00:04:25,980
That man is the most
disreputable man in the world.

98
00:04:26,510 --> 00:04:29,810
You know him, Sensei?

99
00:04:29,810 --> 00:04:30,940
Yes.

100
00:04:30,940 --> 00:04:33,550
My father, Suwa Kozo,

101
00:04:34,140 --> 00:04:37,150
is also Hakamada-sensei's father.

102
00:04:37,150 --> 00:04:38,310
What?!

103

Divorce Chaser Episode 6
Hakamada's Shocking Past Revealed!

105
00:05:03,940 --> 00:05:08,900
If Natsuki-san's father is
Hakamada-sensei's father...

106
00:05:08,900 --> 00:05:13,170
I am Sensei's younger half-sister.

107
00:05:14,690 --> 00:05:17,760
You don't look like him at all.

108
00:05:18,110 --> 00:05:23,610
My father divorced his
mother thirty years ago.

109
00:05:24,790 --> 00:05:27,800
I know I shouldn't force
him into a case such as this.

110
00:05:27,800 --> 00:05:33,130
But, I've discussed this
case with other lawyers,

111
00:05:33,130 --> 00:05:37,870
and they all said it would be difficult
to avoid the lawsuit due to the evidence.

112
00:05:38,990 --> 00:05:42,060
While I was searching for a lawyer,

113
00:05:42,060 --> 00:05:45,880
I came across Hakamada-sensei,
a specialist in divorce issues.

114
00:05:45,880 --> 00:05:51,720
Then, I found out he's is the son
of my father and his former wife.

115
00:05:54,550 --> 00:05:58,060
So I thought he would be the only
one suitable to take this case.

116
00:05:59,360 --> 00:06:01,160
Please, Sensei.

117
00:06:01,670 --> 00:06:04,300
Please protect our father.

118
00:06:07,470 --> 00:06:11,200
So he turned his sister down?

119
00:06:11,200 --> 00:06:14,700
Yes, Sensei was quite firm about it.

120
00:06:12,840 --> 00:06:16,240
Freelance Investigator
Umemoto Kurumi

121
00:06:14,700 --> 00:06:17,570
He must have a grudge
against his father.

122
00:06:18,560 --> 00:06:20,250
We've got trouble!

123
00:06:20,250 --> 00:06:20,960
What's the matter?

124
00:06:20,960 --> 00:06:23,180
Sensei's bread is delicious.

125
00:06:23,180 --> 00:06:25,650
That's not possible!

126
00:06:30,800 --> 00:06:34,320
You're right. It's good.

127
00:06:34,320 --> 00:06:35,550
Not good...

128
00:06:35,550 --> 00:06:37,010
You think so?

129
00:06:37,010 --> 00:06:40,290
It turned out quite well
compared to his usual.

130
00:06:40,290 --> 00:06:42,140
That's not what I mean.

131
00:06:42,140 --> 00:06:45,690
If Sensei's bread is good,
it means he's very distressed.

132
00:06:45,690 --> 00:06:46,990
You think so?

133
00:06:46,990 --> 00:06:50,460
When the water pipes burst
and flooded his home,

134
00:06:50,460 --> 00:06:51,780
he got quite distressed.

135
00:06:51,780 --> 00:06:54,950
The bread he made during that
time was really delicious.

136
00:06:55,730 --> 00:06:58,750
That must be what it takes.

137
00:06:59,110 --> 00:07:02,950
I won't have any work to do if
Sensei stays in this condition.

138
00:07:03,820 --> 00:07:05,620
I'm going home.

139
00:07:09,760 --> 00:07:12,780
It's too bad you won't accept the case.

140
00:07:13,780 --> 00:07:17,500
However, Father did want to see you.

141
00:07:17,500 --> 00:07:19,660
I have no intention of seeing him.

142
00:07:20,060 --> 00:07:22,790
Please tell him I said that.

143
00:07:22,790 --> 00:07:24,210
What?

144
00:07:24,210 --> 00:07:28,040
He left me and my mother.

145
00:07:29,740 --> 00:07:31,180
I understand.

146
00:07:32,530 --> 00:07:34,240
Goodbye.

147
00:07:41,970 --> 00:07:43,990
Who do you think you're
feeling up, you perv?!

148
00:07:43,990 --> 00:07:45,420
What happened?

149
00:07:45,420 --> 00:07:48,350
This geezer tried to cop a feel!

150
00:07:49,050 --> 00:07:50,440
You've got it all wrong.

151
00:07:50,440 --> 00:07:53,990
I was brushing the dust off your butt.

152
00:07:53,990 --> 00:07:55,390
The feisty old man...

153
00:07:55,390 --> 00:07:57,160
Kurumi-san, that's him!

154
00:07:57,160 --> 00:07:58,000
This is who?

155
00:07:58,000 --> 00:07:59,580
That's Hakamada-sensei's father.

156
00:07:59,580 --> 00:08:00,280
Huh?

157
00:08:02,550 --> 00:08:04,390
What's going on?

158
00:08:06,970 --> 00:08:08,420
What are you doing here?!

159
00:08:08,420 --> 00:08:10,890
Hey, Yukio. Long time no see.

160
00:08:10,890 --> 00:08:13,860
I have turned down your daughter's case.

161
00:08:13,790 --> 00:08:17,160
Hakamada's father
Suwa Kozo

162
00:08:13,860 --> 00:08:15,650
Never mind that.

163
00:08:15,650 --> 00:08:18,460
I came to see you today.

164
00:08:18,460 --> 00:08:21,090
I told her I didn't want to see you.

165
00:08:21,090 --> 00:08:22,210
Oh, don't say that.

166
00:08:22,210 --> 00:08:25,070
Let's toast to our reunion.

167
00:08:25,890 --> 00:08:27,600
I don't drink.

168
00:08:29,130 --> 00:08:30,820
You, too, huh?

169
00:08:30,820 --> 00:08:32,540
You can make an exception today.

170
00:08:32,540 --> 00:08:35,860
Right? Miss, bring
us a couple glasses.

171
00:08:35,860 --> 00:08:36,860
Yes.

172
00:08:36,860 --> 00:08:39,210
Don't order around my employees!

173
00:08:39,210 --> 00:08:44,750
Look at you, running
this outstanding office.

174
00:08:44,750 --> 00:08:45,900
Yeah.

175
00:08:47,220 --> 00:08:48,860
I never offered you a seat.

176
00:08:48,860 --> 00:08:53,070
A man is the master of his
own castle, as they say.

177
00:08:53,070 --> 00:08:58,160
After I quit being a contractor
and started my civil engineering firm,

178
00:08:58,160 --> 00:09:00,120
I sure had a lot of hardship.

179
00:09:00,120 --> 00:09:02,610
I don't care about your war stories.

180
00:09:04,660 --> 00:09:07,060
By the way, which one of
these are you diddling?

181
00:09:07,060 --> 00:09:07,860
What?

182
00:09:07,860 --> 00:09:09,870
Look at all these young women.

183
00:09:09,870 --> 00:09:11,510
You must be diddling
at least one of them.

184
00:09:12,000 --> 00:09:13,850
I am not like you.

185
00:09:13,850 --> 00:09:15,920
Want me to guess which one?

186
00:09:15,920 --> 00:09:18,020
This isn't a quiz show!

187
00:09:18,020 --> 00:09:21,470
If you're anything like me,
you go for the good looks.

188
00:09:24,360 --> 00:09:25,710
You.

189
00:09:25,710 --> 00:09:26,760
Huh?

190
00:09:27,430 --> 00:09:29,730
You're a bit large.
Can you move out of the way?

191
00:09:32,500 --> 00:09:34,500
There. She's the one.

192
00:09:34,500 --> 00:09:36,270
What? No, I'm not.

193
00:09:36,270 --> 00:09:37,730
It's not you?

194
00:09:37,730 --> 00:09:39,510
Too bad.

195
00:09:39,510 --> 00:09:40,640
Are you single?

196
00:09:40,640 --> 00:09:42,830
Yes, you could say that.

197
00:09:42,830 --> 00:09:44,830
How about we go on a date?

198
00:09:44,830 --> 00:09:45,460
No...

199
00:09:45,460 --> 00:09:46,920
I'll be a free man soon.

200
00:09:46,920 --> 00:09:48,120
No, that's a little...

201
00:09:48,120 --> 00:09:49,730
That's enough!

202
00:09:50,070 --> 00:09:52,280
Don't you have more pressing concerns?

203
00:09:52,280 --> 00:09:55,000
You're being sued for compensation
for adultery, aren't you?

204
00:09:55,000 --> 00:09:57,640
Natuski's the one raising
all the fuss, that's all.

205
00:09:57,640 --> 00:09:59,920
I'm going to give Chika what she wants.

206
00:10:00,820 --> 00:10:01,810
What?

207
00:10:01,810 --> 00:10:03,450
I've got no excuses.

208
00:10:03,890 --> 00:10:05,090
Besides, I'm a man,

209
00:10:05,090 --> 00:10:08,450
I don't go chasing after
women that run from me.

210
00:10:09,040 --> 00:10:12,550
Instead, I wish her nothing but happiness.

211
00:10:12,990 --> 00:10:14,990
Her happiness?

212
00:10:15,410 --> 00:10:17,770
Where do you get off saying that?

213
00:10:17,770 --> 00:10:20,630
Have you forgotten what
you did to my mother?

214
00:10:20,630 --> 00:10:22,750
That was thirty years ago, though.

215
00:10:26,170 --> 00:10:27,060
Enjoy.

216
00:10:27,060 --> 00:10:29,640
Anyway, let's make a toast.

217
00:10:29,640 --> 00:10:31,490
I'll have a drink.

218
00:10:31,490 --> 00:10:33,520
Yoshie-san, when did you get there?

219
00:10:33,520 --> 00:10:36,230
I smelled fine wine.

220
00:10:36,780 --> 00:10:41,280
By the way, I'm the landlord
here, Toyama Yoshie.

221
00:10:43,120 --> 00:10:45,400
You're no ordinary woman.

222
00:10:45,400 --> 00:10:48,890
You're brimming with hidden eroticism.

223
00:10:48,890 --> 00:10:51,070
You know me well, daddy-o.

224
00:10:51,070 --> 00:10:52,460
Care to try me out?

225
00:10:52,460 --> 00:10:53,330
Sounds good.

226
00:10:53,330 --> 00:10:54,640
Get out of here.

227
00:10:54,640 --> 00:10:57,450
I have nothing to talk to you about.

228
00:10:57,450 --> 00:11:00,220
We haven't seen each other for thirty years.

229
00:11:00,220 --> 00:11:01,720
There must be tons of
stuff to talk about.

230
00:11:01,720 --> 00:11:03,720
You neglected us for thirty years.

231
00:11:03,720 --> 00:11:06,120
It's too late to play the father role.

232
00:11:06,120 --> 00:11:10,190
You and I are complete strangers.

233
00:11:11,220 --> 00:11:13,400
You're making this hard.

234
00:11:13,400 --> 00:11:14,140
Get out.

235
00:11:14,140 --> 00:11:14,820
Huh?

236
00:11:14,820 --> 00:11:15,810
Now!

237
00:11:15,810 --> 00:11:19,670
But the wine... I brought wine...

238
00:11:16,620 --> 00:11:20,110
Get out. Get out of here now!

239
00:11:20,110 --> 00:11:22,520
Get out, now!

240
00:11:22,520 --> 00:11:23,740
What the hell?

241
00:11:26,500 --> 00:11:30,860
Hakamada-sensei, can I
take this wine home?

242
00:11:30,860 --> 00:11:32,210
Do as you please.

243
00:11:36,150 --> 00:11:41,110
Sensei seriously hates his father.

244
00:11:41,610 --> 00:11:45,920
Hakamada-sensei had a rough childhood.

245
00:11:45,920 --> 00:11:48,970
That father of his found
another woman at work,

246
00:11:48,970 --> 00:11:50,750
left home, and never came back.

247
00:11:50,750 --> 00:11:54,750
I heard he never paid for compensation
or for child support.

248
00:11:54,750 --> 00:11:56,990
So that's how it was...

249
00:11:56,990 --> 00:12:02,560
His mother raised him all by herself
and saved enough to send him to college.

250
00:12:02,560 --> 00:12:06,380
She passed away soon
right after he enrolled.

251
00:12:07,130 --> 00:12:11,410
I don't blame him for holding a grudge.

252
00:12:13,450 --> 00:12:14,750
Yoshie-san.

253
00:12:14,750 --> 00:12:17,860
Could it have been it his parents'
divorce that influenced Sensei

254
00:12:17,860 --> 00:12:21,630
to become a divorce lawyer?

255
00:12:23,430 --> 00:12:24,970
Well...

256
00:12:25,330 --> 00:12:27,040
Excuse me.

257
00:12:26,490 --> 00:12:28,060
Oh, Natsuki-san.

258
00:12:28,060 --> 00:12:30,520
Did my father come here?

259
00:12:30,520 --> 00:12:32,820
He was just here.

260
00:12:32,820 --> 00:12:35,040
Sensei kicked him out.

261
00:12:35,270 --> 00:12:37,170
I see.

262
00:12:39,410 --> 00:12:56,930
Hakamada Law Office

263
00:12:41,700 --> 00:12:45,500
I've never seen Sensei so angry.

264
00:12:46,140 --> 00:12:49,040
My father is prideful and awkward.

265
00:12:49,460 --> 00:12:51,980
He must've said
inappropriate things, as usual.

266
00:12:52,650 --> 00:12:57,360
I think his real intention was
to apologize to Hakamada-sensei.

267
00:12:57,360 --> 00:12:58,720
Apologize?

268
00:12:58,720 --> 00:13:01,020
Contrary to how he behaves,
he's contrite.

269
00:13:01,360 --> 00:13:07,440
He regrets being a deadbeat
father to Hakamada-sensei.

270
00:13:08,660 --> 00:13:13,360
I was hoping they could overcome
the bad blood between them.

271
00:13:13,990 --> 00:13:16,870
But, it looks like that's
not going to happen...

272
00:13:19,280 --> 00:13:20,610
Goodbye.

273
00:13:25,140 --> 00:13:27,440
Natsuki-san, please wait.

274
00:13:27,790 --> 00:13:28,920
Yes?

275
00:13:29,530 --> 00:13:32,310
I have an idea.

276
00:13:35,900 --> 00:13:37,600
Excuse me.

277
00:13:37,600 --> 00:13:39,470
Hey, Yukio.

278
00:13:39,470 --> 00:13:41,180
You again?

279
00:13:41,180 --> 00:13:43,140
I told you I am refusing to take the case.

280
00:13:43,140 --> 00:13:44,660
We're not here to see you.

281
00:13:44,660 --> 00:13:46,080
I was waiting for you.

282
00:13:46,080 --> 00:13:46,730
What?

283
00:13:46,730 --> 00:13:51,010
I invited them to use this room
for divorce consultation.

284
00:13:51,010 --> 00:13:52,750
Why must they do that here?

285
00:13:52,750 --> 00:13:55,540
They are willing to pay
for their time here.

286
00:13:55,540 --> 00:13:56,720
Please, this way.

287
00:14:01,730 --> 00:14:03,530
Please, this way.

288
00:14:08,020 --> 00:14:10,860
I am Suwa Chika-san's legal
representative, Tsujimura.

289
00:14:09,330 --> 00:14:11,630
Attorney
Tsujimura

290
00:14:12,300 --> 00:14:15,070
Kozo's wife
Suwa Chika

291
00:14:15,810 --> 00:14:18,640
I am Suwa Kozo's daughter, Natsuki.

292
00:14:20,910 --> 00:14:23,040
And who is your legal representative?

293
00:14:23,040 --> 00:14:24,220
We don't have one.

294
00:14:25,140 --> 00:14:28,660
I had assumed Hakamada-sensei
would be your legal representative.

295
00:14:28,660 --> 00:14:32,010
I will sit in on behalf of my
father for today's consultation.

296
00:14:32,010 --> 00:14:33,920
You'll be saving money,

297
00:14:33,920 --> 00:14:35,890
because hiring a lawyer for
this case would be futile.

298
00:14:35,890 --> 00:14:38,650
Whatever, hurry up and start.

299
00:14:39,550 --> 00:14:42,220
Your father's consultation has begun.

300
00:14:43,420 --> 00:14:45,360
I don't have a father.

301
00:14:45,360 --> 00:14:46,410
But...

302
00:14:46,410 --> 00:14:48,350
Was this your idea, Kanae-san?

303
00:14:48,350 --> 00:14:49,340
What?

304
00:14:49,340 --> 00:14:51,280
That they hold the
consultation at this office.

305
00:14:51,280 --> 00:14:55,850
So I would overhear their conversation,
and jump in to the rescue?

306
00:14:56,250 --> 00:14:57,850
Well...

307
00:15:00,540 --> 00:15:02,680
I don't fall for cheap tricks.

308
00:15:05,230 --> 00:15:07,240
As I've already informed Kozo-san,

309
00:15:07,240 --> 00:15:11,790
five million yen will be billed for compensation,
in addition to the property distribution.

310
00:15:11,790 --> 00:15:12,560
Sounds fine.

311
00:15:12,560 --> 00:15:14,400
We will not consent to those terms.

312
00:15:14,400 --> 00:15:15,800
How is that?

313
00:15:15,800 --> 00:15:19,950
Chika-san, you married my father
for his wealth, didn't you?

314
00:15:19,950 --> 00:15:20,680
What?

315
00:15:20,680 --> 00:15:21,870
What are you saying, Natsuki?

316
00:15:21,870 --> 00:15:26,870
We have no money to give someone who
has already squandered his fortune.

317
00:15:26,870 --> 00:15:29,180
You have no right to say that.

318
00:15:29,180 --> 00:15:31,680
I have been a devoted wife.

319
00:15:31,680 --> 00:15:33,480
What is so devoted about you?

320
00:15:33,480 --> 00:15:37,740
I was told you constantly asked
for gifts, without occasion.

321
00:15:37,740 --> 00:15:40,210
That's all right. I wanted
to give her those gifts.

322
00:15:40,210 --> 00:15:41,950
They're beyond just gifts!

323
00:15:41,950 --> 00:15:43,540
Two foreign cars,

324
00:15:43,540 --> 00:15:46,480
co-ownership of a resort mansion,

325
00:15:46,480 --> 00:15:50,800
and you took him to
that resort only once.

326
00:15:50,800 --> 00:15:53,030
Who were you going there with, anyway?

327
00:15:53,030 --> 00:15:55,170
Maybe you were the one
who was cheating?

328
00:15:55,170 --> 00:15:56,770
You're just making that up!

329
00:15:56,770 --> 00:15:58,280
Please don't bring up baseless claims.

330
00:15:58,280 --> 00:16:03,150
And after he married you,
my father's health waned.

331
00:16:03,150 --> 00:16:05,710
Were you taking good care of him?

332
00:16:05,710 --> 00:16:06,900
Of course.

333
00:16:06,900 --> 00:16:09,520
This is Chika-san's blog.

334
00:16:09,250 --> 00:16:11,550
Chika's Blog:
Tonight's Loving Wife Dinner

335
00:16:09,520 --> 00:16:13,520
You will see here a testament
to Chika-san's love of Kozo-san.

336
00:16:13,520 --> 00:16:16,960
These are dishes, handmade by
her for him, every night.

337
00:16:16,960 --> 00:16:19,520
You're a woman, you should
know how much work that is.

338
00:16:19,520 --> 00:16:24,030
Say what you will.
I loved Kozo-san.

339
00:16:24,970 --> 00:16:27,270
But Kozo-san betrayed me.

340
00:16:37,140 --> 00:16:39,330
You're concerned, aren't you?

341
00:16:39,330 --> 00:16:40,790
No.

342
00:16:40,790 --> 00:16:42,980
I dropped my ballpoint pen.

343
00:16:44,350 --> 00:16:46,470
It's in your front pocket.

344
00:16:51,420 --> 00:16:52,610
There it is.

345
00:16:56,150 --> 00:16:59,460
Be that as it may, we will not concede.

346
00:16:59,460 --> 00:17:01,500
You want to battle it
out in court, then?

347
00:17:01,500 --> 00:17:02,960
In court?

348
00:17:03,820 --> 00:17:06,460
You can go to trial, but the
results will be the same.

349
00:17:06,460 --> 00:17:09,440
We have solid evidence of
his illicit activities.

350
00:17:09,440 --> 00:17:11,230
Those are...

351
00:17:11,230 --> 00:17:13,060
I admit, I went to a hotel with her.

352
00:17:13,060 --> 00:17:14,880
Father, stay out of this.

353
00:17:14,880 --> 00:17:16,750
But, Chika, I'm telling you the truth.

354
00:17:16,750 --> 00:17:19,550
I only did her once.

355
00:17:19,550 --> 00:17:21,600
It's not a matter of
how many times, is it?

356
00:17:21,600 --> 00:17:23,710
He's making a plain admission of guilt.

357
00:17:23,710 --> 00:17:25,840
Please stamp and sign this.

359
00:17:25,840 --> 00:17:27,070
All rightâ€”

360
00:17:27,070 --> 00:17:28,070
Don't.

361
00:17:29,680 --> 00:17:32,560
Give us some time to think about it.

362
00:17:34,910 --> 00:17:37,400
We'll give you one week, then.

363
00:17:37,400 --> 00:17:39,840
The next time will be
our final consultation.

364
00:17:40,550 --> 00:17:42,060
Understood.

365
00:17:44,940 --> 00:17:48,580
Hakamada
Law Office

366
00:17:49,010 --> 00:17:52,290
Was Hakamada-sensei listening?

367
00:17:52,290 --> 00:17:54,760
He seemed quite concerned.

368
00:17:54,760 --> 00:17:57,940
Forget about it. I don't
need that stubborn fool.

369
00:17:57,940 --> 00:17:59,450
Father.

370
00:17:59,450 --> 00:18:00,860
Bye, now.

371
00:18:06,290 --> 00:18:08,160
Father.

372
00:18:20,650 --> 00:18:22,880
They're gone now.

373
00:18:22,880 --> 00:18:24,890
You could've at least seen them out.

374
00:18:24,890 --> 00:18:28,150
I have no relationship with them.

375
00:18:28,150 --> 00:18:31,450
And please, don't rent our office space

376
00:18:31,450 --> 00:18:32,740
without asking me first.

377
00:18:32,740 --> 00:18:35,070
What does it matter?

378
00:18:35,070 --> 00:18:37,320
You don't have to take
them on as a client...

379
00:18:37,320 --> 00:18:40,360
But you could've at least listened,
and given them advice.

380
00:18:40,360 --> 00:18:41,810
Advice?

381
00:18:42,620 --> 00:18:44,980
Then, there's one
thing I've learned.

382
00:18:44,980 --> 00:18:46,070
What's that?

383
00:18:47,150 --> 00:18:49,680
He is being deceived.

384
00:18:49,680 --> 00:18:50,640
What?

385
00:18:50,640 --> 00:18:53,100
Assuming he was telling the truth,

386
00:18:53,100 --> 00:18:57,230
he said he was with his illicit
partner for one time only.

387
00:18:57,230 --> 00:18:58,640
Yes.

388
00:18:58,640 --> 00:19:02,940
Don't you think it's strange
that she could capture

389
00:19:02,940 --> 00:19:05,340
an unexpected one-time
event like that on film?

390
00:19:05,340 --> 00:19:06,690
That's true...

391
00:19:06,690 --> 00:19:09,820
Do you think Chika-san and
her lawyer are scheming?

392
00:19:10,660 --> 00:19:12,190
That is possible.

393
00:19:12,190 --> 00:19:16,920
If you know that,
you could help your father!

394
00:19:17,580 --> 00:19:20,650
It is difficult to prove
there was no illicit affair,

395
00:19:20,650 --> 00:19:24,560
especially since he was photographed
coming out of the hotel.

396
00:19:24,560 --> 00:19:26,140
I know you can do it, Sensei.

397
00:19:26,140 --> 00:19:27,940
Please protect your father.

398
00:19:27,940 --> 00:19:30,280
I have no reason to protect him.

399
00:19:32,140 --> 00:19:36,650
He has been womanizing all his life.

400
00:19:37,490 --> 00:19:41,910
My mother and I fell victim to it.

401
00:19:42,830 --> 00:19:45,350
He should get what's coming to him.

402
00:19:45,350 --> 00:19:47,080
But...

403
00:19:48,160 --> 00:19:52,760
Also, he's willing to pay compensation.

404
00:19:53,610 --> 00:19:55,420
The matter is out of my hands.

405
00:19:58,950 --> 00:20:00,200
I understand.

406
00:20:00,200 --> 00:20:02,140
I'll do it, then.

407
00:20:02,700 --> 00:20:03,970
Do what?

408
00:20:03,970 --> 00:20:07,850
I'm going to find proof that
Chika-san's story is a fabrication.

409
00:20:07,850 --> 00:20:10,650
I'm going to ask Kurumi-san
to help me. Is that okay?

410
00:20:11,320 --> 00:20:13,280
I don't mind, but...

411
00:20:13,630 --> 00:20:17,350
I cannot have you neglect office duties.

412
00:20:17,350 --> 00:20:19,800
There's nothing to do
at this office, anyway.

413
00:20:32,260 --> 00:20:33,720
Um, Sensei...

414
00:20:33,720 --> 00:20:34,950
Yes.

415
00:20:34,950 --> 00:20:37,070
Your father forgot something.

416
00:20:38,130 --> 00:20:40,880
He is not my father.

417
00:20:40,880 --> 00:20:43,300
What should I do with it?

418
00:20:44,580 --> 00:20:45,950
Shinozuka-san,

419
00:20:45,950 --> 00:20:48,310
I'm sorry to trouble you,
but could you deliver it to him?

420
00:20:48,310 --> 00:20:50,120
No, I won't.

421
00:20:50,740 --> 00:20:52,740
He's your father, Sensei.

422
00:20:52,740 --> 00:20:54,960
You should deliver it to him.

423
00:20:55,720 --> 00:20:58,290
There's prescription
medicine in this, too.

424
00:20:58,670 --> 00:21:01,410
You should hurry. He might need it.

425
00:21:10,640 --> 00:21:13,040
Prescription Medicine
Mr. Suwa Kozo

426
00:21:36,930 --> 00:21:38,480
Are you all right?!

427
00:21:39,730 --> 00:21:41,230
Are you all right?

428
00:21:42,230 --> 00:21:43,640
Ambulance.

429
00:21:43,640 --> 00:21:45,720
Someone call an ambulance!

430
00:21:46,340 --> 00:21:47,510
I am sorry.

431
00:21:47,510 --> 00:21:51,610
That's unusual. You've never
requested a deadline extension before.

432
00:21:51,610 --> 00:21:52,950
I'm very sorry.

433
00:21:52,950 --> 00:21:55,370
I'm having writer's block.

434
00:21:54,650 --> 00:21:58,190
Editor at Tokiwa Publishing
Tabata Misato

435
00:21:55,370 --> 00:21:58,520
You can't get material
from the law office?

436
00:21:58,520 --> 00:22:00,790
There's definitely material,

437
00:22:00,790 --> 00:22:04,040
but the problem is that
Sensei is refusing to take on a client.

438
00:22:04,040 --> 00:22:05,520
In that case, there is no problem.

439
00:22:05,520 --> 00:22:06,530
What?

440
00:22:08,160 --> 00:22:09,940
I can feel it.

441
00:22:08,160 --> 00:22:11,200
Cafe waitress:
Mizutani Sara

442
00:22:12,090 --> 00:22:13,140
Hello?

443
00:22:13,140 --> 00:22:15,000
I found the woman in the photo.

444
00:22:15,000 --> 00:22:16,100
Can you come right away?

445
00:22:16,100 --> 00:22:17,250
All right.

446
00:22:17,250 --> 00:22:18,800
I'm sorry. I have to go.

447
00:22:18,800 --> 00:22:19,600
Huh?

448
00:22:20,490 --> 00:22:23,780
Amazing! I feel it so strongly!

449
00:22:23,780 --> 00:22:26,650
Um... she left already.

450
00:22:26,650 --> 00:22:27,600
What?

451
00:22:39,290 --> 00:22:40,850
Yukio.

452
00:22:41,990 --> 00:22:44,600
Was it you that rescued me?

453
00:22:47,370 --> 00:22:49,670
I didn't do it for you, particularly.

454
00:22:50,860 --> 00:22:55,930
I would help anyone who
had collapsed on the street.

455
00:22:57,680 --> 00:22:59,940
How bothersome.

456
00:22:59,940 --> 00:23:04,550
I even had to hear what
the doctor had to say.

457
00:23:05,240 --> 00:23:09,890
Don't tell Chika and Natsuki that I'm sick.

458
00:23:10,890 --> 00:23:13,920
What's the point of being
prideful at a time like this?

459
00:23:13,920 --> 00:23:16,370
You're a complete stranger, aren't you?

460
00:23:17,130 --> 00:23:20,160
What do you care?

461
00:23:31,670 --> 00:23:32,910
How is our father?

462
00:23:33,740 --> 00:23:35,760
He had a minor seizure.

463
00:23:35,760 --> 00:23:40,170
The doctor said he can be
discharged quickly, after he rests.

464
00:23:40,170 --> 00:23:41,840
I see.

465
00:23:42,740 --> 00:23:46,880
Regardless, he should stop drinking.

466
00:23:46,880 --> 00:23:47,990
What?

467
00:23:47,990 --> 00:23:50,690
Father doesn't drink.

468
00:23:50,690 --> 00:23:52,790
He's never been able to drink.

469
00:23:52,790 --> 00:23:53,930
What?

470
00:23:53,930 --> 00:23:56,480
If he drinks, he falls
asleep right away.

471
00:23:56,480 --> 00:24:00,440
He only drinks when he's really happy.

472
00:24:02,030 --> 00:24:05,220
Let's make a toast to our reunion.

473
00:24:05,990 --> 00:24:07,820
I don't drink.

474
00:24:07,820 --> 00:24:09,450
You, too, huh?

475
00:24:10,470 --> 00:24:13,620
I have seen him drunk only three times.

476
00:24:13,620 --> 00:24:17,820
The first time was when I got
first place in a piano competition.

477
00:24:17,820 --> 00:24:21,820
The second time was when his
firm landed a huge contract

478
00:24:21,820 --> 00:24:23,850
for building a train station.

479
00:24:23,850 --> 00:24:28,700
The third time was when
you passed your bar exam.

480
00:24:29,550 --> 00:24:30,600
What?

481
00:24:32,200 --> 00:24:33,900
Though he doesn't show it,

482
00:24:33,900 --> 00:24:37,590
he's always thinks about you,
Hakamada-sensei.

483
00:24:38,630 --> 00:24:41,340
After he found out your
were becoming a lawyer,

484
00:24:41,340 --> 00:24:44,490
he would check the roster of
successful bar examinees, every year.

485
00:24:46,050 --> 00:24:49,920
I once heard him quarreling with
my mother about you, Sensei.

486
00:24:50,660 --> 00:24:53,870
Because he had spent their
money without telling her...

487
00:24:54,780 --> 00:25:00,820
I think he anonymously paid
your college entrance fee.

488
00:25:01,700 --> 00:25:04,140
That man wouldn't do a thing like that.

489
00:25:04,140 --> 00:25:05,930
It's a fact.

490
00:25:06,240 --> 00:25:09,240
I was at that acutely sensitive age...

491
00:25:09,870 --> 00:25:13,270
My father would be concerned
about a child other than me...

492
00:25:13,270 --> 00:25:15,300
Though I had never met that child,

493
00:25:15,300 --> 00:25:17,880
there was a time I was jealous of him.

494
00:25:18,940 --> 00:25:26,150
Oh, and Sensei. I know you believe
my father is a womanizer...

495
00:25:26,150 --> 00:25:31,820
But, I don't think he's ever
cheated on my mother.

496
00:25:32,620 --> 00:25:35,050
Now that, I can't believe.

497
00:25:35,430 --> 00:25:38,430
He was probably just hiding it from you.

498
00:25:38,430 --> 00:25:41,440
Do you think my father
is capable of hiding anything?

499
00:25:46,740 --> 00:25:48,810
Hakamada

500
00:26:03,170 --> 00:26:04,690
Though he doesn't show it,

501
00:26:04,690 --> 00:26:07,960
he's always thinks about you,
Hakamada-sensei.

502
00:26:09,390 --> 00:26:11,200
But, I know you can do it, Sensei.

503
00:26:11,200 --> 00:26:12,830
Please protect your father.

504
00:26:19,810 --> 00:26:21,940
I see you're immersed in your thoughts.

505
00:26:21,940 --> 00:26:23,170
Yoshie-san...

506
00:26:23,170 --> 00:26:24,410
When did you come in?

507
00:26:24,410 --> 00:26:26,090
I've been here the whole time.

508
00:26:26,470 --> 00:26:28,880
You've finally decided to help your father.

509
00:26:28,880 --> 00:26:29,880
Huh?

510
00:26:29,880 --> 00:26:32,520
Because the only time you listen
to music and knead dough

511
00:26:32,520 --> 00:26:35,850
is when you're thinking
about your client.

512
00:26:37,370 --> 00:26:39,530
I was thinking of a different client.

513
00:26:39,950 --> 00:26:43,300
Oh? Was there another client in here?

514
00:26:44,760 --> 00:26:47,520
Kanae-chan has been wondering...

515
00:26:48,130 --> 00:26:54,570
if you became a divorce lawyer
because of your father.

516
00:26:55,400 --> 00:26:57,680
I wouldn't dismiss that as incorrect.

517
00:26:58,500 --> 00:27:00,860
If only I had knowledge of the law,

518
00:27:00,860 --> 00:27:03,470
I could've sued my father

519
00:27:03,470 --> 00:27:09,130
for compensation and child support
after he divorced my mother.

520
00:27:09,620 --> 00:27:15,800
But, you initially went into
corporate law, didn't you?

521
00:27:16,230 --> 00:27:18,180
How did you know that?

522
00:27:18,590 --> 00:27:21,680
I love gossip, that's how.

523
00:27:26,700 --> 00:27:30,600
You've forgiven your father, haven't you?

524
00:27:36,610 --> 00:27:40,070
Oh, please. You're so lecherous.

525
00:27:40,070 --> 00:27:42,050
I'll have to punish you next time.

526
00:27:45,870 --> 00:27:48,070
Are you Murakami Kanna-san?

527
00:27:48,070 --> 00:27:48,970
Huh?

528
00:27:48,970 --> 00:27:50,060
Who are you people?

529
00:27:50,060 --> 00:27:52,780
I'm a freelance investigator,
Umemoto Kurumi.

530
00:27:52,780 --> 00:27:55,730
I'm her assistant, Nonomura Kanae.

531
00:27:57,630 --> 00:28:00,500
Is that you in this photograph?

532
00:28:01,300 --> 00:28:04,710
Kozo's illicit partner
Murakami Kanna

533
00:28:01,550 --> 00:28:05,810
Can you explain to us why you went
to this hotel with Suwa Kozo-san?

534
00:28:06,550 --> 00:28:09,240
I've already explained that to an attorney.

535
00:28:09,240 --> 00:28:11,710
His name is Tsujimura-san.

536
00:28:11,710 --> 00:28:14,620
We need to confirm
some facts on our end.

537
00:28:14,620 --> 00:28:16,340
Please.

538
00:28:19,630 --> 00:28:23,940
I was at a restaurant, and
Kozo-san started talking to me.

539
00:28:24,730 --> 00:28:27,320
He bought me drinks,

540
00:28:27,320 --> 00:28:31,150
then lured me to a hotel.

541
00:28:31,150 --> 00:28:35,870
Are you sure it was Kozo-san
who started talking to you?

542
00:28:35,870 --> 00:28:36,820
Yeah.

543
00:28:36,820 --> 00:28:38,500
And was he the one who
lured you to the hotel?

544
00:28:38,500 --> 00:28:40,080
It was Kozo-san.

545
00:28:40,700 --> 00:28:42,410
Why are you asking?

546
00:28:42,410 --> 00:28:47,570
You're personal acquaintances
with Suwa Chika-san, aren't you?

547
00:28:47,570 --> 00:28:48,570
What?

548
00:28:48,920 --> 00:28:50,970
No. I don't know her.

549
00:28:50,970 --> 00:28:54,170
Well, that's strange.

550
00:28:54,170 --> 00:28:59,070
Weren't the two of you in the same
escort service until two years ago?

551
00:28:59,070 --> 00:29:00,250
I don't know her.

552
00:29:00,250 --> 00:29:01,670
Hm...

553
00:29:01,670 --> 00:29:04,240
Maybe she asked you...

554
00:29:04,240 --> 00:29:07,150
...to lure Kozo-san to the hotel?

555
00:29:07,150 --> 00:29:09,700
What are you people after?

556
00:29:09,700 --> 00:29:12,660
We just want to know the truth.

557
00:29:12,660 --> 00:29:15,710
Everything I said is true.

558
00:29:15,710 --> 00:29:17,080
Now, excuse me.

559
00:29:18,910 --> 00:29:21,540
You're not unfamiliar with
cases like this, are you?

560
00:29:22,070 --> 00:29:25,860
You have a history of going
to hotels with married men.

561
00:29:25,860 --> 00:29:28,820
Every time, they are photographed,

562
00:29:28,820 --> 00:29:32,440
and get sued for compensation
within a few months.

563
00:29:32,440 --> 00:29:34,930
That's more than just coincidence.

564
00:29:34,930 --> 00:29:39,530
If you get me started,
I'll investigate all of your past deeds.

565
00:29:39,530 --> 00:29:42,310
Once I've latched onto my target,
I never let go.

566
00:29:42,310 --> 00:29:43,690
Because I am...

567
00:29:43,690 --> 00:29:46,600
Freelance Investigator Umemoto Kurumi!

568
00:29:48,110 --> 00:29:52,380
Will you speak the truth
at the divorce consultation?

569
00:29:56,300 --> 00:29:57,810
I will.

570
00:29:58,220 --> 00:30:00,650
Hakamada Law Office

571
00:29:59,820 --> 00:30:03,790
I am attending Kozo-san's
final divorce consultation.

572
00:30:03,790 --> 00:30:08,130
It starts at 2:00, at their lawyer's office.

573
00:30:08,130 --> 00:30:10,010
Won't you come with me, Sensei?

574
00:30:10,010 --> 00:30:13,430
No, I have to go somewhere.

575
00:30:13,430 --> 00:30:14,930
And where would that be?

576
00:30:16,490 --> 00:30:18,770
There's a kind of bread I'm interested in.

577
00:30:22,440 --> 00:30:24,890
Why must you be so obstinate?

578
00:30:37,130 --> 00:30:38,650
Thank you for waiting.

579
00:30:40,200 --> 00:30:42,630
Today's consultation will
go well, I assure you.

580
00:30:42,630 --> 00:30:44,940
We've gathered powerful evidence.

581
00:30:44,940 --> 00:30:48,560
Thank you for all of your help.

582
00:30:49,660 --> 00:30:52,420
Isn't Yukio coming?

583
00:30:52,420 --> 00:30:54,970
He has other business to attend.

584
00:30:54,970 --> 00:30:56,340
I see.

585
00:31:01,010 --> 00:31:03,110
Would you care for more bread?

586
00:31:06,050 --> 00:31:07,980
Would you care for more bread?

587
00:31:07,980 --> 00:31:09,790
This is good bread.

588
00:31:09,790 --> 00:31:11,860
It's made with domestic wheat flour.

589
00:31:11,860 --> 00:31:13,850
Probably from Hokkaido.

590
00:31:13,850 --> 00:31:14,950
Am I right?

591
00:31:14,950 --> 00:31:17,120
No. It's from Canada.

592
00:31:18,330 --> 00:31:19,870
I see.

593
00:31:20,700 --> 00:31:22,330
Oh, one more thing.

594
00:31:22,330 --> 00:31:24,100
I have a question.

595
00:31:24,570 --> 00:31:27,530
First Conference Room

596
00:31:25,020 --> 00:31:27,530
Have you reached a decision?

597
00:31:27,530 --> 00:31:28,200
Yes.

598
00:31:28,200 --> 00:31:32,160
We cannot consent to
this divorce agreement.

599
00:31:32,540 --> 00:31:34,180
Don't be ridiculous.

600
00:31:34,180 --> 00:31:36,560
Kozo-san is clearly guilty
of illicit activity.

601
00:31:36,560 --> 00:31:38,450
Concerning that issue...

602
00:31:39,270 --> 00:31:40,630
Chika-san.

603
00:31:40,630 --> 00:31:43,520
You know Murakami
Kanna-san here, don't you?

604
00:31:43,520 --> 00:31:44,420
What?

605
00:31:44,420 --> 00:31:48,430
You were both in the same
escort service, weren't you?

606
00:31:48,430 --> 00:31:51,480
Did you ask your friend Kanna-san

607
00:31:51,480 --> 00:31:54,450
lure my father to the hotel?

608
00:31:54,450 --> 00:31:56,530
To have the upper hand in
the divorce consultation?

609
00:31:56,530 --> 00:31:58,470
I've done no such thing.

610
00:31:58,470 --> 00:31:59,500
Can you prove it?

611
00:31:59,500 --> 00:32:02,300
We have proof.

612
00:32:02,300 --> 00:32:05,040
Then, show us.

613
00:32:05,040 --> 00:32:06,830
For that...

614
00:32:07,480 --> 00:32:09,370
please wait a little while.

615
00:32:11,050 --> 00:32:13,470
Kanna-san is late.

616
00:32:16,340 --> 00:32:17,380
This is bad...

617
00:32:17,380 --> 00:32:19,910
She's not picking up.

618
00:32:19,910 --> 00:32:23,390
When are you producing
this so-called proof?

619
00:32:21,590 --> 00:32:23,390
First Conference Room

620
00:32:23,390 --> 00:32:25,400
Please wait just a little longer.

621
00:32:30,420 --> 00:32:33,240
Perhaps you are waiting
for Murakami Kanna-san?

622
00:32:33,240 --> 00:32:34,230
What?

623
00:32:34,660 --> 00:32:37,150
If it's her you're waiting for,
she won't be coming.

624
00:32:37,150 --> 00:32:38,530
How did you...

625
00:32:38,530 --> 00:32:41,640
Kanna-san contacted me the other day.

626
00:32:41,640 --> 00:32:43,630
She was very distressed.

627
00:32:43,630 --> 00:32:47,380
She said an investigator
you hired blackmailed her,

628
00:32:47,380 --> 00:32:48,660
and was forcing her
to fabricate evidence.

629
00:32:48,660 --> 00:32:49,980
That's ridiculous.

630
00:32:49,980 --> 00:32:52,680
I understand not wanting
to pay compensation.

631
00:32:52,680 --> 00:32:56,320
But your actions are tantamount
to the crime of blackmail.

632
00:32:59,480 --> 00:33:00,760
She's not answering.

633
00:33:02,100 --> 00:33:05,020
Let's forget about Kanna-sa.
We need another course of action.

634
00:33:05,020 --> 00:33:07,750
It's too late for another
course of action.

635
00:33:07,750 --> 00:33:11,310
Chika-san is completely innocent
with respect to this divorce.

636
00:33:11,310 --> 00:33:13,240
Based on various information sources,

637
00:33:13,240 --> 00:33:17,200
it is clear that Chika-san has
been a devoted wife to Kozo-san.

638
00:33:18,280 --> 00:33:23,110
Please seal and sign
the consultation form.

639
00:33:24,730 --> 00:33:27,450
You did what you could, Natsuki.

640
00:33:28,290 --> 00:33:29,920
Father.

641
00:33:33,290 --> 00:33:37,150
I'm going to go apologize
to Natsuki-san.

642
00:33:44,130 --> 00:33:45,330
Kanae-san.

643
00:33:53,100 --> 00:33:56,210
Please, don't do that just yet.

644
00:33:56,210 --> 00:33:57,690
Hakamada-sensei?

645
00:33:57,690 --> 00:34:00,120
Yukio, what are you doing here?

646
00:34:00,730 --> 00:34:01,650
Who are you?

647
00:34:01,650 --> 00:34:03,470
Sorry for not introducing
myself the other day.

648
00:34:04,430 --> 00:34:06,620
I'm Hakamada, attorney at law.

649
00:34:06,620 --> 00:34:09,660
I am his assistant, Nonomura Kanae.

650
00:34:09,660 --> 00:34:12,850
You are Suwa Kozo-san's
legal representative?

651
00:34:12,850 --> 00:34:14,200
No.

652
00:34:14,200 --> 00:34:16,350
I'm just passing through.

653
00:34:16,920 --> 00:34:18,450
This is a consultation.

654
00:34:18,450 --> 00:34:20,200
Please leave if you
have no business here.

655
00:34:20,200 --> 00:34:22,560
No, he does have business here.

656
00:34:22,560 --> 00:34:26,380
He's the witness who I invited here.

657
00:34:26,380 --> 00:34:27,550
Yes.

658
00:34:27,550 --> 00:34:31,080
He has important information
pertaining to this consultation.

659
00:34:33,240 --> 00:34:35,960
I have a question for Chika-san.

660
00:34:35,960 --> 00:34:37,430
Me?

661
00:34:38,770 --> 00:34:43,300
Did you really love this man?

662
00:34:43,300 --> 00:34:44,980
Of course I loved him.

663
00:34:44,980 --> 00:34:46,660
That's why I married him.

664
00:34:47,240 --> 00:34:51,650
What's so good about this tired,
lecherous geezer?

665
00:34:51,650 --> 00:34:52,600
What?

666
00:34:52,600 --> 00:34:53,640
Huh?

667
00:34:53,640 --> 00:34:56,580
He's prideful, he's selfish,

668
00:34:56,580 --> 00:35:00,090
and, oh yes, his feet
smell utterly horrible.

669
00:35:00,090 --> 00:35:02,280
Why would you want to
marry a man like that?

670
00:35:02,280 --> 00:35:03,610
What's that supposed to mean?

671
00:35:03,610 --> 00:35:08,140
When we first met, Kozo-san
was very kind to me.

672
00:35:08,140 --> 00:35:09,690
"Kind"?

673
00:35:09,690 --> 00:35:12,850
You mean he bought you a lot of gifts.

674
00:35:12,850 --> 00:35:14,110
What's wrong with that?

675
00:35:14,110 --> 00:35:18,410
He's vastly knowledgable,
and told me lots of interesting things.

676
00:35:18,410 --> 00:35:20,420
Vastly knowledgable?

677
00:35:20,420 --> 00:35:23,890
His brain is stuck at
middle-school level.

678
00:35:23,890 --> 00:35:25,800
Sensei, what are you saying?

679
00:35:25,800 --> 00:35:27,730
Did you come here to
talk trash about me?

680
00:35:27,730 --> 00:35:31,570
Yes. Because you have
been nothing but trouble.

681
00:35:31,570 --> 00:35:33,370
How long must you bear a grudge?

682
00:35:33,370 --> 00:35:36,480
You've been a wuss ever
since your were a kid.

683
00:35:36,480 --> 00:35:38,340
Take your quarrel somewhere else.

684
00:35:38,340 --> 00:35:40,130
This is a consultation.

685
00:35:41,160 --> 00:35:42,980
Pardon me.

686
00:35:42,980 --> 00:35:46,080
In that case, one last thing.

687
00:35:46,080 --> 00:35:49,660
Since you love him so much,

688
00:35:49,660 --> 00:35:51,820
you know about his sickness, correct?

689
00:35:51,820 --> 00:35:52,640
Sickness?

690
00:35:52,640 --> 00:35:54,690
I told you not to tell her.

691
00:35:54,690 --> 00:35:57,660
Since you seem to not know,
let me explain it to you.

692
00:35:58,970 --> 00:36:03,890
He has had diabetes for two years.

693
00:36:05,670 --> 00:36:08,110
But, you cared nothing about that,

694
00:36:08,110 --> 00:36:10,880
and supposedly made him
plenty of rich meals.

695
00:36:10,880 --> 00:36:14,730
I-It's because I didn't know.

696
00:36:14,730 --> 00:36:16,950
Of course she didn't. I didn't tell her.

697
00:36:16,950 --> 00:36:18,580
Understood.

698
00:36:18,580 --> 00:36:22,850
Let's say you didn't
know he was diabetic.

699
00:36:22,850 --> 00:36:26,400
But, despite being a couple,

700
00:36:26,400 --> 00:36:29,590
you took no notice of
an obvious symptom.

701
00:36:29,590 --> 00:36:31,290
Hey, don't you dare.

702
00:36:31,290 --> 00:36:38,770
Suwa Kozo-san has erectile
dysfunction from his diabetes.

703
00:36:38,770 --> 00:36:40,070
What?

704
00:36:43,240 --> 00:36:45,580
Well, not really, you see...

705
00:36:45,580 --> 00:36:47,640
While I was talking to his doctor,

706
00:36:47,640 --> 00:36:49,730
I glanced at his medical records.

707
00:36:50,600 --> 00:36:53,650
He hasn't gotten hard
for two years.

708
00:36:53,650 --> 00:36:54,760
Idiot!

709
00:36:54,760 --> 00:36:55,890
Don't be so explicit!

710
00:36:55,890 --> 00:37:00,170
Maybe that's divine punishment for all
the womanizing in your younger days.

711
00:37:00,170 --> 00:37:02,880
Shut up, Yukio, or I'll kick your ass right here!

712
00:37:01,700 --> 00:37:03,490
Father! Please be quiet.

713
00:37:04,030 --> 00:37:09,190
Now, would a man like that
lure a woman to a hotel?

714
00:37:10,330 --> 00:37:11,900
He's a prideful man.

715
00:37:11,900 --> 00:37:14,490
He doesn't want others
to learn of his weaknesses.

716
00:37:15,100 --> 00:37:18,560
Do you think a man like that
would take a woman to a hotel,

717
00:37:18,560 --> 00:37:20,870
and make himself
vulnerable to ridicule?

718
00:37:22,460 --> 00:37:24,030
And by the way,

719
00:37:24,030 --> 00:37:29,120
I spoke to the waiter at the
restaurant where he met Kanna-san.

720
00:37:29,120 --> 00:37:36,570
He said he saw Kanna-san put
alcohol in his soft drink.

721
00:37:36,570 --> 00:37:38,100
As you might know,

722
00:37:38,100 --> 00:37:40,520
this man does not drink.

723
00:37:41,130 --> 00:37:44,110
He immediately became inebriated,

724
00:37:44,110 --> 00:37:47,810
which made it easier
to lure him to the hotel,

725
00:37:47,810 --> 00:37:49,620
for the purpose of taking evidence photos.

726
00:37:51,550 --> 00:37:56,510
Gold digging and lovelessness aside,

727
00:37:56,510 --> 00:38:00,860
consider the action of framing
your innocent husband,

728
00:38:01,300 --> 00:38:05,640
of scheming to steal
his fund for old age.

729
00:38:08,470 --> 00:38:11,040
I know I'm overstepping my
bounds, but let me ask you...

730
00:38:11,700 --> 00:38:15,560
What is it about you that
is a "loving wife"?

731
00:38:31,760 --> 00:38:35,780
So, Hakamada-sensei came
to the rescue after all.

732
00:38:35,780 --> 00:38:39,230
In spite of being such a sourpuss.

733
00:38:39,230 --> 00:38:43,150
Thankfully, Chika-san has retracted
the compensation lawsuit,

734
00:38:43,150 --> 00:38:45,240
and there will be no property
distribution, either.

735
00:38:45,240 --> 00:38:47,060
I see. I'm glad.

736
00:38:48,510 --> 00:38:50,330
Hello.

737
00:38:51,200 --> 00:38:52,100
Hello.

738
00:38:52,100 --> 00:38:55,300
Thank you for everything
you've done for us.

739
00:38:55,300 --> 00:38:56,280
Is Yukio here?

740
00:38:56,280 --> 00:38:57,810
Sensei is baking bread in the back.

741
00:38:57,810 --> 00:38:58,840
Wait, Father...

742
00:38:58,840 --> 00:39:01,230
What you did was uncalled for.

743
00:39:01,660 --> 00:39:02,790
What might that be?

744
00:39:02,790 --> 00:39:05,040
I told you not to tell
anyone about "that."

745
00:39:05,040 --> 00:39:09,380
I'd rather pay five million yen
than have it revealed.

746
00:39:09,380 --> 00:39:10,640
Father.

747
00:39:10,640 --> 00:39:12,980
Stop being so prideful.

748
00:39:13,490 --> 00:39:15,910
Where would you get that kind of money?

749
00:39:16,500 --> 00:39:19,860
I hear you're scraping the
bottom of your savings.

750
00:39:20,990 --> 00:39:23,460
How do you plan to support
yourself in your old age?

751
00:39:24,300 --> 00:39:26,030
And also...

752
00:39:26,030 --> 00:39:30,500
it was what you did
that was uncalled for.

753
00:39:31,240 --> 00:39:35,790
I was going to pay for my
own college entrance fee.

754
00:39:37,680 --> 00:39:39,200
What are you talking about?

755
00:39:39,710 --> 00:39:43,800
You spend money out of pride,

756
00:39:44,490 --> 00:39:46,890
so now you're broke. Isn't that so?

757
00:39:48,890 --> 00:39:52,600
Let me just say this...

758
00:39:55,850 --> 00:39:59,670
Thank you for having done that for me.

759
00:40:00,510 --> 00:40:03,270
I don't know what you're talking about.

760
00:40:03,270 --> 00:40:05,800
But, hey, how about this today?

761
00:40:05,800 --> 00:40:08,860
Like I said many times,

762
00:40:08,860 --> 00:40:10,320
I cannot drink.

763
00:40:10,320 --> 00:40:11,790
Just this one time, come on.

764
00:40:11,790 --> 00:40:14,470
Shouldn't you listen to your doctor?

765
00:40:16,150 --> 00:40:21,880
So, let's just stick to one glass each.

766
00:40:30,970 --> 00:40:32,120
Yukio.

767
00:40:32,630 --> 00:40:33,920
Thanks.

768
00:40:34,640 --> 00:40:35,480
Huh?

769
00:40:36,310 --> 00:40:38,050
You really helped me out.

770
00:40:39,510 --> 00:40:40,900
And...

771
00:40:42,090 --> 00:40:43,950
I am truly sorry.

772
00:40:52,080 --> 00:40:53,920
I don't know what you're talking about.

773
00:41:09,410 --> 00:41:11,100
They fell asleep so fast.

774
00:41:11,570 --> 00:41:14,200
It hasn't even been ten minutes.

775
00:41:14,200 --> 00:41:18,350
Father, you shouldn't be sleeping here.

776
00:41:19,570 --> 00:41:20,920
Look at them side-by-side.

777
00:41:20,920 --> 00:41:22,990
They look so alike.

778
00:41:22,990 --> 00:41:25,310
They're father-son after all.

779
00:41:30,170 --> 00:41:31,400
Horrible.

780
00:41:31,400 --> 00:41:32,750
Water, water.

781
00:41:34,720 --> 00:41:36,810
I'm so glad.

782
00:41:36,810 --> 00:41:38,420
About what?

783
00:41:38,420 --> 00:41:42,230
Sensei's been freed from
his decades-long grudge.

784
00:41:43,570 --> 00:41:49,670
His parents' divorce must have driven
Sensei to become a divorce lawyer.

785
00:41:49,670 --> 00:41:51,970
No, that wasn't it.

786
00:41:51,970 --> 00:41:53,240
What's the reason, then?

787
00:41:54,200 --> 00:41:55,270
I wonder...

788
00:41:55,890 --> 00:41:59,470
You should ask him about that.

789
00:42:00,220 --> 00:42:01,830
Thanks for the wine.

790
00:42:09,690 --> 00:42:21,230
Next episode

791
00:42:10,060 --> 00:42:13,850
I can't find a marriage partner
because of the marriage counselor!

792
00:42:12,460 --> 00:42:16,190
Get compensation from a crooked marriage counselor!

793
00:42:13,850 --> 00:42:16,710
A dishonest marriage counselor
like that should get punished!

794
00:42:16,630 --> 00:42:20,400
Umemoto Kurumi's Shocking Past Revealed!

795
00:42:16,710 --> 00:42:21,320
I can't forgive people
who look down on others.

796
00:42:21,230 --> 00:42:24,670
This drama is a work of fiction

797
00:42:21,320 --> 00:42:24,640
Win or lose, that's my responsibility.
