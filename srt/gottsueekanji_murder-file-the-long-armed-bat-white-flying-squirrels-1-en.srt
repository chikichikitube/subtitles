Murder File: The Long-Armed-Bat-White-Flying-Squirrel

2
00:00:06,280 --> 00:00:10,090
The victim, the long-armed-bat-white-flying-squirrel's time of death...

3
00:00:10,090 --> 00:00:11,420
...was 10 o'clock last night.

4
00:00:11,990 --> 00:00:14,060
A knife in the chest.

5
00:00:14,290 --> 00:00:15,130
I see.

6
00:00:15,560 --> 00:00:18,200
Everything was locked
from the inside.

7
00:00:18,460 --> 00:00:20,200
There's no trace of
the killer's getaway.

8
00:00:21,000 --> 00:00:22,200
A locked room, huh?

9
00:00:22,800 --> 00:00:23,340
Yes.

10
00:00:23,340 --> 00:00:24,370
What else do we know?

11
00:00:24,670 --> 00:00:29,540
The knife was covered with the fingerprints of a ramen shop employee living next door.

12
00:00:30,240 --> 00:00:31,380
That's suspicious.

13
00:00:33,980 --> 00:00:34,510
Detective Hamada!

14
00:00:34,510 --> 00:00:35,650
What's up?

15
00:00:36,180 --> 00:00:38,150
Around 7 o'clock last night...

16
00:00:38,150 --> 00:00:38,650
Yeah?

17
00:00:38,650 --> 00:00:40,820
...the person in apartment
201 next door...

18
00:00:40,820 --> 00:00:46,320
...asked me to ask you if Mr. Long-Armed-Bat-White-Flying-Squirrel and a child were kissing.

19
00:00:48,330 --> 00:00:50,160
They really asked that?

20
00:00:50,330 --> 00:00:51,160
They really asked that.

21
00:00:51,700 --> 00:00:52,900
I made up an answer.

22
00:00:53,800 --> 00:00:54,630
I see.

23
00:00:59,100 --> 00:01:00,540
I just got some new information!

24
00:01:00,540 --> 00:01:01,440
Oh? What's up?

25
00:01:01,810 --> 00:01:03,210
According to the
apartment manager...

26
00:01:03,240 --> 00:01:05,180
...the victim was never in
his room at night time.

27
00:01:06,040 --> 00:01:08,050
So that means...

28
00:01:08,380 --> 00:01:09,480
...the victim was nocturnal?

29
00:01:09,550 --> 00:01:10,320
Yes.

30
00:01:10,780 --> 00:01:12,150
The crime took place in daylight.

31
00:01:12,820 --> 00:01:13,790
So that means...

32
00:01:14,290 --> 00:01:15,950
...he was carried here.

33
00:01:16,290 --> 00:01:17,760
I was told to tell you that.

34
00:01:19,760 --> 00:01:21,060
Who told you that?

35
00:01:21,430 --> 00:01:22,530
I can't tell you that.

36
00:01:23,600 --> 00:01:24,530
I like your style.

37
00:01:28,030 --> 00:01:29,670
- Detective Hamada!
- What's up?

38
00:01:29,700 --> 00:01:31,340
I just learned something amazing.

39
00:01:31,340 --> 00:01:31,900
What's that?

40
00:01:32,040 --> 00:01:35,140
I talked with the head girl at a
snack bar the victim often visited...

41
00:01:35,240 --> 00:01:39,410
...and she seemed disappointed that his arms weren't as long as everyone makes them out to be.

42
00:01:40,380 --> 00:01:41,550
Really?

43
00:01:42,180 --> 00:01:44,320
This is completely
fabricated information...

44
00:01:45,220 --> 00:01:49,190
...apparently the victim said "As
long as I have long arms, I won't
let those bastards do as they like."

45
00:01:50,120 --> 00:01:51,060
That's weird.

46
00:01:51,060 --> 00:01:51,420
Huh?

47
00:01:51,690 --> 00:01:52,960
According to what I heard...

48
00:01:53,260 --> 00:01:55,330
..."It's good to let those
bastards do what they want"...

49
00:01:55,330 --> 00:01:56,360
Apparently the victim said this.

50
00:01:57,000 --> 00:01:59,160
Whichever one it is just
who are "those bastards"?

51
00:01:59,400 --> 00:02:00,400
Who are "those bastards"?

52
00:02:00,500 --> 00:02:01,570
Does it matter?

53
00:02:02,500 --> 00:02:03,470
I want to eat.

54
00:02:05,970 --> 00:02:06,740
Also...

55
00:02:07,140 --> 00:02:08,540
...this is from the
couple living next door.

56
00:02:08,540 --> 00:02:09,210
Yeah?

57
00:02:09,470 --> 00:02:12,710
Apparently the victim sang
one of his hometown songs
in a loud vo ice last night.

58
00:02:12,810 --> 00:02:14,210
What hometown song?

59
00:02:14,650 --> 00:02:16,210
I'm a little bit unsure on that point.

60
00:02:17,550 --> 00:02:18,480
I'd have sex with you.

61
00:02:20,220 --> 00:02:21,550
Can I mention one more thing?

62
00:02:21,590 --> 00:02:22,320
What is it?

63
00:02:22,320 --> 00:02:24,120
According to his coworker...

64
00:02:24,120 --> 00:02:28,130
...the victim apparently said
"If you kill me, lock everything
from the inside and kill me."

65
00:02:28,690 --> 00:02:29,560
That's weird.

66
00:02:29,900 --> 00:02:31,060
According to what I heard...

67
00:02:31,060 --> 00:02:34,900
...he apparently always stressed that
he never did anything like lock things.

68
00:02:35,830 --> 00:02:39,340
Hmm, well we can't know the
layout of the room in this state.

69
00:02:39,340 --> 00:02:43,280
Well, the owner stated it's a 15-tatami mat size when he advertised the room.

70
00:02:44,810 --> 00:02:46,410
Does the owner look suspicious?

71
00:02:46,410 --> 00:02:49,550
No, he moved to
Australia 15 years ago.

72
00:02:49,550 --> 00:02:50,950
He's the prime minister there now.

73
00:02:53,650 --> 00:02:54,490
I knew that.

74
00:02:55,250 --> 00:02:55,850
Inspector!

75
00:02:56,220 --> 00:02:57,720
There's a hidden door over here!

76
00:02:57,720 --> 00:02:58,390
What?!

77
00:02:59,090 --> 00:03:00,490
There's a child inside!

78
00:03:00,490 --> 00:03:01,260
A child?

79
00:03:01,360 --> 00:03:02,760
I'm saying an adult!

80
00:03:04,060 --> 00:03:04,730
Ok.

81
00:03:04,830 --> 00:03:05,930
- Let's take a look.
- Ok.

82
00:03:06,670 --> 00:03:07,600
Please don't!

83
00:03:08,330 --> 00:03:09,670
That's my private thing.

84
00:03:12,270 --> 00:03:13,070
I like your style.

85
00:03:14,340 --> 00:03:14,970
Ok!

86
00:03:14,970 --> 00:03:15,940
At any rate...

87
00:03:15,940 --> 00:03:17,210
...let's start again at step one.

88
00:03:22,380 --> 00:03:23,550
Yeah, but...

89
00:03:24,250 --> 00:03:25,120
...just what happened here?

90
00:03:25,120 --> 00:03:27,050
Hey, me... I'm... I have no clue.

91
00:03:29,450 --> 00:03:33,120
To be continued?
