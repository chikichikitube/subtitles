1
00:00:01,120 --> 00:00:05,880
At a certain hot spring, there is an inn where liars gather

2
00:00:09,160 --> 00:00:11,320
Why are you so angry

3
00:00:12,880 --> 00:00:15,320
No no, it's not that I'm mad

4
00:00:15,320 --> 00:00:18,880
I forgot how this thing started

5
00:00:19,600 --> 00:00:23,000
If we started right away or not

6
00:00:21,440 --> 00:00:23,280
Ah I see

7
00:00:23,720 --> 00:00:26,920
Fully Improvised Liar's Inn

8
00:00:27,400 --> 00:00:32,120
The person on the card nominates someone to tell a lie

9
00:00:32,440 --> 00:00:38,040
The nominated person must maintain the lie given to them

10
00:00:38,040 --> 00:00:39,360
Here I go

11
00:00:39,360 --> 00:00:41,120
Yeah go on

12
00:00:41,120 --> 00:00:43,120
Hosei nominates someone to tell a lie

13
00:00:44,080 --> 00:00:50,760
I think it was during the student years, so this is a decades old story,

14
00:00:51,160 --> 00:00:57,480
Matsumoto-san, you went to a vocational school for Onmiyoji right?

15
00:00:51,160 --> 00:00:57,480
TN: Onmiyoji are people that study Onmyodo; "a system of natural science, astronomy, almanac, divination and magic"

16
00:00:54,360 --> 00:00:57,480
Yeah, I did. In fact I still go.

17
00:00:57,760 --> 00:00:59,080
To the Onmiyoji?

18
00:00:59,080 --> 00:01:02,240
I don't really know anything about it

19
00:01:02,240 --> 00:01:04,000
Can anyone go to the classes?

20
00:01:04,000 --> 00:01:11,720
Ah, this is something that's kind of bad to say, I had a rewards points card,

21
00:01:11,720 --> 00:01:15,640
And if you got enough points, you could get into that sort of thing

22
00:01:15,640 --> 00:01:18,680
Eh, you can get that?

23
00:01:18,680 --> 00:01:20,560
I think Hamada can get it too

24
00:01:20,560 --> 00:01:21,600
Really?

25
00:01:21,600 --> 00:01:28,680
It's in the top ten. There's a special catalog for long time customers

26
00:01:28,680 --> 00:01:30,920
Oh yeah there's lots of stuff

27
00:01:29,440 --> 00:01:32,120
You can stay in a hotel somewhere,

28
00:01:32,280 --> 00:01:33,440
Stuff like that

29
00:01:32,840 --> 00:01:34,600
Special prizes

30
00:01:33,720 --> 00:01:38,600
Special prizes and so on. But on the back, is the real thing,

31
00:01:38,600 --> 00:01:42,070
I didn't know about that at all

32
00:01:39,600 --> 00:01:42,680
"You may be able to enter Onmiyoji!"

33
00:01:41,480 --> 00:01:42,680
"May be"?

34
00:01:42,680 --> 00:01:47,800
That's on purpose, like "You might". You can go actually of course,

35
00:01:47,800 --> 00:01:52,400
But on purpose, to catch your attention. Like "You might!".

36
00:01:53,680 --> 00:01:59,760
So it's been, 2, 3, ... 20 years? 20 years I've been doing this Onmiyoji thing

37
00:02:00,240 --> 00:02:01,760
How many points does it cost?

38
00:02:01,760 --> 00:02:04,720
That one, it costs 58,000

39
00:02:04,720 --> 00:02:06,360
It costs 58,000 points

40
00:02:06,640 --> 00:02:08,200
That's quite a lot

41
00:02:08,200 --> 00:02:13,560
Most people, most people spend it on Matsuzaka Beef

42
00:02:13,560 --> 00:02:17,640
If they had that many points? It is quite a lot

43
00:02:18,280 --> 00:02:19,760
Excuse me but,

44
00:02:19,760 --> 00:02:24,640
At this age, marbled beef is very heavy

45
00:02:25,920 --> 00:02:33,880
When you're younger though, you can eat 200-300 grams easily

46
00:02:33,880 --> 00:02:38,320
Enough of that. Are you knowledgeable about it now?

47
00:02:38,320 --> 00:02:41,040
Of course I am, I've been doing it for 20 years

48
00:02:41,040 --> 00:02:43,210
What do you do?

49
00:02:43,210 --> 00:02:45,340
What is Onmiyoji?

50
00:02:45,340 --> 00:02:50,560
Ghost expulsion, and also ghost capture- chewing

51
00:02:50,560 --> 00:02:51,920
Chewing?!

52
00:02:51,920 --> 00:02:53,280
You eat ghosts?

53
00:02:53,280 --> 00:02:55,400
Sometimes I have to chew them, the small ones

54
00:02:55,600 --> 00:02:58,360
It puts people off though so I didn't wanna talk about this

55
00:02:58,360 --> 00:03:00,440
I didn't know about this

56
00:03:00,440 --> 00:03:03,240
I don't wanna say too much

57
00:03:03,240 --> 00:03:04,600
Please tell us (x2)

58
00:03:04,600 --> 00:03:06,440
How do you capture them?

59
00:03:06,440 --> 00:03:08,400
There's different types of ghosts too

60
00:03:08,400 --> 00:03:14,960
So, if I had to explain it, like a Japanese version of Ghostbusters,

61
00:03:14,960 --> 00:03:16,440
That's easy to explain

62
00:03:16,440 --> 00:03:18,360
They use like machines and stuff

63
00:03:18,360 --> 00:03:22,560
You know that start shaped thing? What do you call it, the star thing

64
00:03:23,000 --> 00:03:25,560
I summon them there

65
00:03:25,560 --> 00:03:27,960
By like placing a Banana or something

66
00:03:27,960 --> 00:03:29,240
Banana?

67
00:03:29,240 --> 00:03:32,080
When I wake up in the morning I catch quite a lot

68
00:03:32,080 --> 00:03:34,760
It's like you're capturing insects isn't it?

69
00:03:34,760 --> 00:03:36,800
You use a Banana?

70
00:03:37,720 --> 00:03:39,960
What do you do then?

71
00:03:39,960 --> 00:03:43,480
It depends, on my mood, if I'm hungry I'll chew them

72
00:03:43,480 --> 00:03:44,840
So you are eating them?

73
00:03:44,840 --> 00:03:47,280
You just eat them like that?

74
00:03:47,280 --> 00:03:50,120
You feel the electric shock though,

75
00:03:48,800 --> 00:03:50,520
Electric shock?

76
00:03:50,520 --> 00:03:53,680
Cause there's a thing (barrier) there

77
00:03:51,640 --> 00:03:53,680
You're the one who put it there

78
00:03:54,480 --> 00:04:01,920
Ah, right, I have to break the seal, and then eat them

79
00:04:01,920 --> 00:04:03,400
How do you break it, like this?

80
00:04:03,400 --> 00:04:06,680
Like "I'm gon-na break the seal"

81
00:04:07,320 --> 00:04:09,760
I don't have my notes right now though

82
00:04:09,760 --> 00:04:11,480
You look at your notes?

83
00:04:11,480 --> 00:04:13,080
Even though it's been 20 years?

84
00:04:13,080 --> 00:04:20,120
You can't memorise it! I'll show it to you then, it's super thick

85
00:04:20,120 --> 00:04:23,000
You basically just eat them? Are there big ones too?

86
00:04:23,000 --> 00:04:24,240
There are big ones

87
00:04:24,240 --> 00:04:26,920
What do you do for those ones?

88
00:04:25,160 --> 00:04:27,320
How large are they?

89
00:04:27,320 --> 00:04:29,120
The biggest one

90
00:04:29,120 --> 00:04:31,640
Hmm, I guess about this big

91
00:04:31,640 --> 00:04:33,440
That's not big

92
00:04:33,440 --> 00:04:35,600
You guys don't understand the category!

93
00:04:35,600 --> 00:04:41,280
You don't know! This is huge, the normal ones are this small

94
00:04:42,280 --> 00:04:44,520
Ah, normally they're this size?

95
00:04:44,520 --> 00:04:46,680
Ghosts are like that? I thought they were bigger

96
00:04:48,120 --> 00:04:52,440
You've never seen a ghost before in your lives and yet you're deciding what's big and small

97
00:04:52,440 --> 00:04:56,560
Saying things like "that's small!" pisses me off
I'm done! I'm not talking anymore!

98
00:04:57,600 --> 00:04:58,680
I'm done talking!

99
00:04:58,680 --> 00:05:04,720
Please don't say that. We just don't know anything, I'm sorry

100
00:05:04,720 --> 00:05:07,880
Is it just ghosts around you or do people call you over?

101
00:05:07,880 --> 00:05:09,680
They do they do

102
00:05:09,680 --> 00:05:15,240
There's a lot in the political world

103
00:05:15,640 --> 00:05:18,360
I'm only telling you guys,

104
00:05:18,360 --> 00:05:19,200
What kind of ghosts?

105
00:05:19,200 --> 00:05:22,000
Only I can see them, you guys can't right?

106
00:05:22,000 --> 00:05:26,080
There was one climbing up and down the Diet building

107
00:05:26,080 --> 00:05:28,120
That's fine

108
00:05:28,120 --> 00:05:31,880
Do you charge high fees for places like that?

109
00:05:32,200 --> 00:05:36,240
I do say "It's not about the money"

110
00:05:36,240 --> 00:05:42,120
But even if I don't take their money, they send me impressive gifts at the end of the year

111
00:05:42,800 --> 00:05:46,800
Like Matsusaka Beef

112
00:05:45,280 --> 00:05:47,160
Matsusaka Beef?

113
00:05:47,160 --> 00:05:49,600
It should be on the Point Card

114
00:05:49,600 --> 00:05:52,600
You don't like Matsusaka Beef?

115
00:05:50,800 --> 00:05:56,320
No, no, I did the Onmiyoji because I don't like Matsusaka Beef,

116
00:05:56,320 --> 00:06:00,880
But in the end, I still received it

117
00:06:00,880 --> 00:06:03,080
In the end-

118
00:06:08,080 --> 00:06:11,090
If we can't see them it doesn't matter

119
00:06:10,120 --> 00:06:11,720
You eat them though right?

120
00:06:11,720 --> 00:06:12,960
I do I do

121
00:06:13,200 --> 00:06:14,880
I didn't know that

122
00:06:14,880 --> 00:06:17,340
One of them even ran away after I ate it

123
00:06:16,440 --> 00:06:17,640
That's scary

124
00:06:17,800 --> 00:06:19,600
That's super scary

125
00:06:18,480 --> 00:06:21,600
One leg, it ran away on one leg

126
00:06:20,120 --> 00:06:21,720
Scary!

127
00:06:23,160 --> 00:06:25,520
Endo nominates someone to tell a lie

128
00:06:23,840 --> 00:06:25,440
Endo-kun

129
00:06:26,000 --> 00:06:28,960
He came to Gaki the other day,

130
00:06:28,960 --> 00:06:32,000
Ryuchell, you know him right

131
00:06:30,120 --> 00:06:32,040
Yes, Ryuchell

132
00:06:32,040 --> 00:06:36,600
Hosei-san, I've heard he's rather a close relative of yours

133
00:06:36,600 --> 00:06:39,080
Oh, how?

134
00:06:39,080 --> 00:06:43,640
Yeah, are you relatives?

135
00:06:43,640 --> 00:06:47,000
Would you call us relatives?

136
00:06:47,000 --> 00:06:53,600
He's my father's sister's son

137
00:06:53,600 --> 00:06:55,120
That's a relative

138
00:06:54,360 --> 00:06:56,960
Oh, that's a relative

139
00:06:55,200 --> 00:06:58,640
You're pretty closely related

140
00:06:58,920 --> 00:07:01,760
You guys must meet if you're that closely related

141
00:07:03,040 --> 00:07:07,040
I've never met him before, but I do care for him

142
00:07:07,040 --> 00:07:10,880
Eh? But when he came the other day it didn't seem like that at all

143
00:07:10,880 --> 00:07:14,320
He did say that. I am a comedian,

144
00:07:14,320 --> 00:07:19,480
And Ryuchell, is a fashion...person.

145
00:07:19,760 --> 00:07:24,080
So Comedians and Fashion cannot mix

146
00:07:24,080 --> 00:07:28,040
That's not true. You see it on variety shows all the time

147
00:07:28,040 --> 00:07:30,130
It's impossible after all

148
00:07:29,120 --> 00:07:30,760
Is it hard to work together?

149
00:07:30,760 --> 00:07:37,200
It sure is...Cause sometimes I can tell he's looking at me, cause we're relatives

150
00:07:37,200 --> 00:07:39,600
So you only met recently

151
00:07:39,600 --> 00:07:41,920
Did he contact you before he came to Gaki?

152
00:07:41,920 --> 00:07:44,520
Actually he did

153
00:07:44,520 --> 00:07:47,440
On LINE, he said "Next time,"

154
00:07:47,440 --> 00:07:51,760
He calls me Hosei-chan you see,

155
00:07:51,760 --> 00:07:56,960
"Hosei-chan, I'm coming to Gaki, let's work together"

156
00:07:56,960 --> 00:07:59,840
He said like "Please bully a little"

157
00:07:59,840 --> 00:08:01,960
"Please bully a little" he said

158
00:08:01,960 --> 00:08:03,280
Who bullies who?

159
00:08:03,280 --> 00:08:04,360
Ryuchell,

160
00:08:04,640 --> 00:08:05,840
He's bullied by who?

161
00:08:05,840 --> 00:08:07,000
Me

162
00:08:07,000 --> 00:08:11,280
Like "please pick on me" you mean? But that didn't happen

163
00:08:11,280 --> 00:08:16,960
I didn't do it of course, but he did say "Please bully me" in an Osaka dialect

164
00:08:15,800 --> 00:08:17,400
What?

165
00:08:17,400 --> 00:08:19,000
In Osaka-

166
00:08:17,880 --> 00:08:19,480
So hard to follow

167
00:08:20,080 --> 00:08:21,920
Is my story hard to follow?

168
00:08:20,880 --> 00:08:24,840
It's hard to follow, it's super hard to follow

169
00:08:24,840 --> 00:08:26,560
Why that face...

170
00:08:26,560 --> 00:08:28,840
Who picked the name Ryuchell

171
00:08:28,840 --> 00:08:36,400
Ryuchell...was decided by my mother's side

172
00:08:36,400 --> 00:08:37,600
It's his real name?

173
00:08:37,600 --> 00:08:40,180
It's his real name

174
00:08:38,680 --> 00:08:40,680
That's his real name?

175
00:08:40,680 --> 00:08:43,320
Ryuchell isn't his real name,

176
00:08:43,320 --> 00:08:46,680
Ryuchie~.... Ryuichi

177
00:08:46,680 --> 00:08:48,560
Ryuichi?

178
00:08:47,360 --> 00:08:48,560
Yes, Ryuichi

179
00:08:48,560 --> 00:08:51,360
It's Ryuichi?

180
00:08:49,400 --> 00:08:51,360
Ryuichi is his real name

181
00:08:51,360 --> 00:08:54,560
So Ryuchell isn't his real name at all then. It's Ryuichi?

182
00:08:55,440 --> 00:08:57,440
He said it was Ryuchell before
He did

183
00:08:57,440 --> 00:09:03,000
I messed up his real name, but I asked him for the truth and he said it's Ryuichi

184
00:09:03,000 --> 00:09:07,280
He does a lot of secret work! He does it all the time

185
00:09:07,560 --> 00:09:10,240
The beauty parlor and everything is done secretly

186
00:09:11,280 --> 00:09:13,640
What the hell is that?

187
00:09:13,640 --> 00:09:18,440
Like in real life him in and Peko aren't dating

188
00:09:18,440 --> 00:09:24,000
Oh sorry, Peko-chan and him are good friends

189
00:09:24,840 --> 00:09:28,480
Oh I see

190
00:09:27,040 --> 00:09:29,080
It was dangerous at one point

191
00:09:29,080 --> 00:09:35,080
It was dangerous at one point, but my dad got involved, and I got involved, and we worked things out

192
00:09:35,080 --> 00:09:36,000
What happened?

193
00:09:36,000 --> 00:09:38,000
Oh you don't know?

194
00:09:38,560 --> 00:09:42,040
When was it again? Right back when Rachell...

195
00:09:42,040 --> 00:09:43,240
Rachell?

196
00:09:46,200 --> 00:09:48,720
Horrible. This guy sucks.

197
00:09:48,720 --> 00:09:51,280
This guy really sucks

Fully Improvised! Liar's Inn. They must maintain the lie no matter what!!

200
00:10:02,480 --> 00:10:04,720
Here I go

201
00:10:03,280 --> 00:10:05,000
Go ahead

202
00:10:06,120 --> 00:10:08,880
Hamada nominates someone to tell a lie

203
00:10:06,600 --> 00:10:07,840
Hamada-san

204
00:10:07,840 --> 00:10:09,520
Dahama-san

205
00:10:10,320 --> 00:10:14,200
Tanaka, earlier I saw you really fighting with your manager

206
00:10:14,200 --> 00:10:19,120
What happened? I've never seen you be that angry before

207
00:10:19,360 --> 00:10:25,800
Well, to sum it up, I couldn't take it anymore

208
00:10:25,800 --> 00:10:28,600
Like I exploded

209
00:10:28,600 --> 00:10:29,920
Tanaka exploded...

210
00:10:29,920 --> 00:10:31,680
What happened?

211
00:10:31,680 --> 00:10:35,240
It's his mocking

212
00:10:35,240 --> 00:10:37,200
Him mocking me

213
00:10:37,200 --> 00:10:43,600
Tanaka maybe you're overthinking it. A manager, making fun of their talent?

214
00:10:43,600 --> 00:10:47,920
First, he said he really hates me

215
00:10:47,920 --> 00:10:49,320
My manager

216
00:10:49,320 --> 00:10:50,640
He said that?

217
00:10:50,640 --> 00:10:52,920
That does kinda suck

218
00:10:51,800 --> 00:10:54,360
It does, but he said it to me very clearly

219
00:10:54,360 --> 00:10:56,100
Did you ask why?

220
00:10:55,160 --> 00:10:57,480
I did. He said "You're not funny"

221
00:10:57,960 --> 00:11:01,360
That's... I hate that too actually

222
00:11:01,360 --> 00:11:04,160
That's not good

223
00:11:04,160 --> 00:11:10,080
He said he hates having to manage an unfunny comedian

224
00:11:10,080 --> 00:11:12,360
Why does he think you're unfunny?

225
00:11:12,360 --> 00:11:13,880
My performance

226
00:11:14,120 --> 00:11:17,520
He didn't say anything about Endo?

227
00:11:16,220 --> 00:11:19,820
It seems he doesn't really like Endo

228
00:11:17,520 --> 00:11:19,080
No way, me too?

229
00:11:19,680 --> 00:11:23,600
Well yeah, unfortunately it does make sense

230
00:11:23,760 --> 00:11:29,120
If he hates Tanaka, it makes sense he wouldn't really like Endo

231
00:11:28,240 --> 00:11:31,540
I never really got that impression

232
00:11:30,680 --> 00:11:34,440
It is unfortunate, but yeah he hates me

233
00:11:34,440 --> 00:11:36,920
And, yes, he hates Endo too

234
00:11:36,920 --> 00:11:38,680
Like joint responsibility kind of

235
00:11:38,680 --> 00:11:43,680
He said he hates me, which I don't like,
and even after this is over, I just hate it

236
00:11:43,680 --> 00:11:47,480
Cause even after this he's gonna say it again
"You weren't funny again today huh?"

237
00:11:48,160 --> 00:11:51,920
That's really not alright

238
00:11:49,800 --> 00:11:51,920
If someone says that to you...

239
00:11:51,920 --> 00:11:56,400
Your mind just starts to snap. Every set, every shooting, no matter the occasion

240
00:11:56,400 --> 00:11:58,440
So he said it to you before we started today?

241
00:11:58,440 --> 00:12:00,400
He did he did

242
00:12:00,400 --> 00:12:03,000
He said like "You're gonna be funny today, right?"

243
00:12:03,000 --> 00:12:05,320
So you just snapped

244
00:12:04,280 --> 00:12:07,800
I snapped like "Cut it out already, every single day you do this"

245
00:12:07,800 --> 00:12:09,360
That's what I saw

246
00:12:08,360 --> 00:12:11,800
That's what you saw, me telling him to cut it out

247
00:12:12,080 --> 00:12:16,560
So when you got the job on ZIP, it would be normal for a manager to say "Congrats, do your best!"

248
00:12:16,560 --> 00:12:18,520
He didn't say that

249
00:12:18,880 --> 00:12:23,290
"What the hell are you gonna be able to do on ZIP" is what he said

250
00:12:21,360 --> 00:12:22,960
Seriously?

251
00:12:23,800 --> 00:12:26,120
And that just made me snap

252
00:12:26,120 --> 00:12:28,800
That would make you snap

253
00:12:28,800 --> 00:12:32,440
What was the first thing you yelled at him?

254
00:12:32,440 --> 00:12:37,720
"Stop calling me like boring and unfunny"

255
00:12:38,160 --> 00:12:44,800
"Stop saying that to me, it's driving me crazy!" is what I said to him

256
00:12:45,240 --> 00:12:49,680
And right after I said that he beat me up...

257
00:12:52,040 --> 00:12:53,800
And you don't remember

258
00:12:54,800 --> 00:12:59,920
He beat you so hard you forgot, that's the worst
He called you unfunny and then beat you

259
00:13:01,720 --> 00:13:04,760
Matsumoto nominates someone

260
00:13:01,920 --> 00:13:04,600
Matsumoto-san again, you will pick someone...

261
00:13:05,800 --> 00:13:11,600
I heard Nukumizu-san smacked Yamasaki in the toilet

262
00:13:11,600 --> 00:13:13,040
Eh?!

263
00:13:14,880 --> 00:13:17,360
That guy is really mild mannered

264
00:13:17,360 --> 00:13:20,480
In the NTV Kojimachi toilet, here

265
00:13:20,480 --> 00:13:28,480
Yes yes yes.
Right now, and I don't agree, but everyone says my hair is getting thinner right

266
00:13:28,480 --> 00:13:30,380
Ah your hair?

267
00:13:29,200 --> 00:13:32,120
Yeah, my hair is getting thinner

268
00:13:30,760 --> 00:13:32,880
I don't think it is though

269
00:13:32,880 --> 00:13:39,880
I get it thinned by the hairdresser. They take a lot off using the crescent moon scissors

270
00:13:39,880 --> 00:13:46,280
So I do tell people that when they ask me, not just Nukumizu-san,

271
00:13:46,280 --> 00:13:53,360
At other studios when people say "Oh your hair is getting thinner"
I say "I'm just getting it thinned by the hairdresser"

272
00:13:53,360 --> 00:13:56,600
So maybe that was aired

273
00:13:57,160 --> 00:14:01,960
And Nukumizu-san saw that it seems

274
00:14:02,400 --> 00:14:05,960
He asked like "You're getting it thinned?"

275
00:14:06,680 --> 00:14:08,400
That's fine though

276
00:14:07,360 --> 00:14:09,040
Why did he get mad

277
00:14:09,040 --> 00:14:11,200
You met him in the washroom?

278
00:14:10,000 --> 00:14:12,480
Why does he care if you're getting it thinned

279
00:14:12,480 --> 00:14:18,280
"You're getting it thinned you say?" Is what he said

280
00:14:18,280 --> 00:14:26,280
And I said like "Oh, did I say that?"
He replied "Yes you did"

281
00:14:26,280 --> 00:14:28,600
"Hey asshole!"

282
00:14:28,600 --> 00:14:30,480
All of a sudden?

283
00:14:29,240 --> 00:14:30,760
All of a sudden

284
00:14:31,400 --> 00:14:33,920
Why though? What's there to get mad about?

285
00:14:33,920 --> 00:14:38,040
Maybe he was angry from the start

286
00:14:38,040 --> 00:14:41,320
And it's not like you said anything to Nukumizu-san

287
00:14:41,320 --> 00:14:45,320
Yes exactly. In the start I had no idea what he was talking about

288
00:14:45,320 --> 00:14:53,320
"By saying you're getting it thinned...Isn't your hair super thin?" he said

289
00:14:54,160 --> 00:14:58,040
Sorry I don't understand, I really don't understand

290
00:14:58,640 --> 00:15:00,080
Can I eat a mandarin please

291
00:15:00,080 --> 00:15:02,640
No way, you're telling a story right now

292
00:15:03,200 --> 00:15:05,600
Yeah sorry I don't understand

293
00:15:04,240 --> 00:15:06,520
I can't eat a mandarin in the middle of my story

294
00:15:07,400 --> 00:15:08,960
What happened?

295
00:15:10,120 --> 00:15:11,560
Nukumizu-san?

296
00:15:11,560 --> 00:15:14,360
I can't understand at all. What?

297
00:15:14,360 --> 00:15:21,200
Nukumizu-san, even though we've never met he really took care of me

298
00:15:23,160 --> 00:15:25,680
Nukumizu-san took care of you?

299
00:15:25,680 --> 00:15:30,280
So he got angry after that? I heard you got smacked

300
00:15:30,280 --> 00:15:32,040
Yes, it starts from here

301
00:15:32,040 --> 00:15:38,480
After that, so many times (nanpatsu)

302
00:15:39,320 --> 00:15:42,880
Nanptsu sounds like Sanpatsu (haircut), so confusing

303
00:15:45,440 --> 00:15:48,720
Enough already

304
00:15:50,160 --> 00:15:54,200
Enough already! Such a goddamn uninteresting story

305
00:15:57,840 --> 00:15:59,840
Endo nominates someone to tell a lie

306
00:15:58,880 --> 00:16:00,600
Endo-san

307
00:16:01,320 --> 00:16:04,600
This is something that shocked all my juniors,

308
00:16:04,600 --> 00:16:08,160
Hamada-san, you've used a meridian channel before?

309
00:16:08,160 --> 00:16:09,080
When you press it

310
00:16:09,080 --> 00:16:10,920
Oh yeah I know that one

311
00:16:10,920 --> 00:16:12,120
It makes you explode right?

312
00:16:12,800 --> 00:16:14,960
Ahhh yeah yes

313
00:16:14,960 --> 00:16:17,480
But doesn't using it kill you?

314
00:16:16,280 --> 00:16:18,480
Yeah I wanted to know how you stopped it

315
00:16:18,480 --> 00:16:22,200
Oh yeah it's not a big deal, I just put some pressure on it

316
00:16:23,200 --> 00:16:25,440
Oh, so it does make you swell?

317
00:16:26,120 --> 00:16:28,160
Who made you explode?

318
00:16:28,160 --> 00:16:30,600
Was there a meridian channel master nearby?

319
00:16:29,240 --> 00:16:30,760
Yes yes

320
00:16:31,120 --> 00:16:33,040
I don't know exactly, but he went like "Hey Hey"

321
00:16:33,040 --> 00:16:35,080
Where did this happen?

322
00:16:34,080 --> 00:16:35,320
A foreigner?

323
00:16:35,320 --> 00:16:36,760
Hey Hey?

324
00:16:36,760 --> 00:16:39,820
Like "here & here & here"

325
00:16:39,820 --> 00:16:45,600
Where did this happen? Were you eating, were you backstage?

326
00:16:46,520 --> 00:16:51,760
It was on my way home. Right as I parked the car in the parking lot,

327
00:16:52,200 --> 00:16:54,240
Wow so they totally ambushed you

328
00:16:54,240 --> 00:16:55,720
I think I was being targeted

329
00:16:55,720 --> 00:16:57,000
You never saw them before?

330
00:16:57,000 --> 00:16:57,920
Not at all

331
00:16:57,920 --> 00:17:00,960
So it was like Fist of the North Star?

332
00:17:00,960 --> 00:17:04,680
I don't know if it was like that, but he did have a Mohican haircut

333
00:17:04,960 --> 00:17:08,420
That's totally Zako from Fist of the North Star

334
00:17:09,040 --> 00:17:11,600
Wow, he really exists

335
00:17:12,160 --> 00:17:17,440
"What is this guy? What's his deal?" and slowly my face started swelling

336
00:17:17,840 --> 00:17:19,960
I went "Oh crap"!

337
00:17:19,960 --> 00:17:25,020
Well it's a good thing you were in your neighborhood, you could go home right away

338
00:17:22,080 --> 00:17:26,280
Yes yes exactly. I was just swelling up like this

339
00:17:26,280 --> 00:17:29,080
I got home and said "Go get me some ice!"

340
00:17:30,520 --> 00:17:33,320
Oh right, you iced it down

341
00:17:33,480 --> 00:17:36,240
So basically you just thought to put ice on it?

342
00:17:36,240 --> 00:17:39,720
Yeah I didn't know what to do, I just thought ice is good for swelling

343
00:17:39,720 --> 00:17:41,680
And I gradually pushed it down

344
00:17:41,680 --> 00:17:44,440
And nothing happened after that?

345
00:17:45,000 --> 00:17:49,280
Like swelling up out of nowhere, or seeing some swelling when you wake up?

346
00:17:49,280 --> 00:17:54,560
Oh no, but actually like Endo just said, when I use the bath it does puff up a bit

347
00:17:55,240 --> 00:18:02,200
I thought it would be bad to get a fever, so I just rushed out

348
00:18:02,200 --> 00:18:04,040
And I got the ice again

349
00:18:04,480 --> 00:18:07,120
Oh, you didn't mention that

350
00:18:11,600 --> 00:18:15,280
I would never have known without asking

351
00:18:14,610 --> 00:18:17,710
Tanaka nominates someone to tell a lie

352
00:18:15,280 --> 00:18:16,320
Tanaka-san

353
00:18:16,320 --> 00:18:17,920
Tanachi

354
00:18:18,640 --> 00:18:24,600
Well we were talking about Meridian Channels. And well I don't know if this is true,

355
00:18:24,760 --> 00:18:26,760
Endo,

356
00:18:26,760 --> 00:18:30,720
I heard you got bit by a zombie,

357
00:18:30,720 --> 00:18:35,160
and miraculously recovered to a human

358
00:18:35,160 --> 00:18:38,800
Well whether or not I recovered is up to your judgment I guess,

359
00:18:38,800 --> 00:18:40,480
Have I recovered?

360
00:18:40,480 --> 00:18:45,760
I can't really tell, I thought that story was a lie

361
00:18:45,760 --> 00:18:48,120
Then I think I have recovered. If I'm being serious

362
00:18:48,120 --> 00:18:52,440
I do try to recover, but I can't really tell myself.

363
00:18:52,440 --> 00:18:57,000
Isn't this turning out the same as Hamada's story?

364
00:18:58,040 --> 00:19:02,400
Oh yes, not at all, no no not at all

365
00:19:02,400 --> 00:19:08,280
So it's true then, you got bit by a zombie?

366
00:19:09,440 --> 00:19:11,200
Zombies exist?

367
00:19:11,200 --> 00:19:13,480
Yes they exist, I got bit after all

368
00:19:13,480 --> 00:19:14,640
Where was this?

369
00:19:14,640 --> 00:19:17,580
Right as I parked the car in the parking lot

370
00:19:16,840 --> 00:19:18,560
Parking lot?

371
00:19:18,560 --> 00:19:22,040
Just like how I parked my car...

372
00:19:23,280 --> 00:19:26,400
Well it was a different location of course

373
00:19:24,960 --> 00:19:30,840
In a parking lot, he came out from behind the back of an Alphard

374
00:19:30,840 --> 00:19:34,200
It just rushed me like *PAPAPAPA*, seriously just rushed me

375
00:19:34,200 --> 00:19:35,520
They move that fast?

376
00:19:35,520 --> 00:19:36,920
Yeah super fast

377
00:19:36,920 --> 00:19:39,120
Why though?

378
00:19:39,120 --> 00:19:44,080
Yeah like, like this he came at me, and bit me like,

379
00:19:44,080 --> 00:19:48,240
Here, this area, he bit me like this

380
00:19:48,640 --> 00:19:51,480
Ow ow ow! I did that of course

381
00:19:51,480 --> 00:19:57,080
It was pretty late at night, like 11:30, around then. He had his knife stabbed and his eye dangling

382
00:19:57,080 --> 00:20:00,220
Enough of that, what happened when it bit you?

383
00:19:59,160 --> 00:20:02,790
I went "OW!" and I thought for now I should,

384
00:20:02,790 --> 00:20:07,680
I should go home, and I told my wife "Let's try cooling it down"

385
00:20:09,000 --> 00:20:10,040
With what?

386
00:20:10,040 --> 00:20:12,640
Ice, from the refrigerator

387
00:20:13,640 --> 00:20:15,440
What the hell are you saying?

388
00:20:15,440 --> 00:20:17,640
What were you even talking about at the end

389
00:20:22,040 --> 00:20:25,040
Hamada nominates someone to tell a lie

390
00:20:23,120 --> 00:20:25,160
Dahama-san

391
00:20:24,040 --> 00:20:25,600
Oh me?

392
00:20:25,600 --> 00:20:30,440
Matsumoto-san, is it true, you've been asking the agency for some advice

393
00:20:30,440 --> 00:20:31,680
Oh, you know about it

394
00:20:31,680 --> 00:20:33,400
Oh, is it about that thing?

395
00:20:33,400 --> 00:20:35,040
What thing?

396
00:20:35,040 --> 00:20:38,840
He said something about turning his right hand into a drill

397
00:20:39,320 --> 00:20:42,520
Eh? What do you mean?

398
00:20:43,400 --> 00:20:44,360
This is,

399
00:20:44,360 --> 00:20:47,880
"Is it alright? Will the agency mind?" is what he's been asking I've heard

400
00:20:48,280 --> 00:20:50,280
Why do you wanna do it? The drill?

401
00:20:50,280 --> 00:20:55,600
I was drinking with Takasu-sensei coincidentally,

402
00:20:55,600 --> 00:20:59,680
And he said something like "Don't turn it into a drill"

403
00:21:00,160 --> 00:21:03,420
But why did he say that?

404
00:21:01,560 --> 00:21:03,720
What's the point?

405
00:21:03,720 --> 00:21:08,040
I was super conflicted but we decided on changing just 2 things

406
00:21:08,040 --> 00:21:10,080
That was fast, but why?

407
00:21:10,080 --> 00:21:11,680
Why a drill?

408
00:21:11,680 --> 00:21:15,760
Why a drill? Alright listen I'm a southpaw,

409
00:21:15,760 --> 00:21:20,160
When I write I use my left hand, basically I do everything with my left hand

410
00:21:20,160 --> 00:21:23,280
So thinking about how little I use my right hand,

411
00:21:23,280 --> 00:21:27,840
And when I talked about this to Takasu-sensei, he said like
"Matsumoto-san, are you using righty?"

412
00:21:27,840 --> 00:21:30,120
And it just shocked me

413
00:21:30,720 --> 00:21:31,920
He said that?

414
00:21:32,000 --> 00:21:35,240
It just convinced me, I thought let's do it

415
00:21:35,960 --> 00:21:38,040
I've already got the mold made

416
00:21:38,920 --> 00:21:41,840
But, what's the point of the drill?

417
00:21:41,840 --> 00:21:43,600
Yeah, instead of a hand

418
00:21:43,600 --> 00:21:48,680
Even this, this is a fake hand

419
00:21:48,680 --> 00:21:50,680
It's like a false tooth?
It's like a false tooth

420
00:21:51,360 --> 00:21:52,720
It can work like a drill?!

421
00:21:52,720 --> 00:21:55,880
No no, it's a temporary hand

422
00:21:55,880 --> 00:21:58,120
They cut it off once,

423
00:21:58,600 --> 00:22:03,400
And when they attached it, it was rotating like this,

424
00:22:03,400 --> 00:22:07,120
I asked, "Sensei, isn't this rotation weird?"

425
00:22:07,840 --> 00:22:12,680
He said "Sorry!" it's a matter of millimeters after all,

426
00:22:12,680 --> 00:22:19,200
They got rid of the hand they cut off, so I have a temporary hand right now and it's kind of hard to move

427
00:22:19,200 --> 00:22:20,440
But I can't tell at all...

428
00:22:20,440 --> 00:22:22,020
You were fine up until now

429
00:22:22,760 --> 00:22:26,800
It's something that I have to be aware of

430
00:22:26,800 --> 00:22:29,280
When do you rotate it?

431
00:22:29,280 --> 00:22:33,320
Oh, like when I have a bad morning

432
00:22:34,160 --> 00:22:35,640
What do you mean?

433
00:22:35,640 --> 00:22:38,440
I can massage myself like this when I have a bad morning

434
00:22:38,440 --> 00:22:40,080
Isn't that dangerous?

435
00:22:39,160 --> 00:22:42,400
I don't do it that hard, it's my own drill after all!

436
00:22:42,400 --> 00:22:45,040
But isn't it dangerous when just wake up?

437
00:22:44,160 --> 00:22:47,760
Yeah I could take some skin off, that's not good

438
00:22:48,480 --> 00:22:52,360
I just go "whir whir, whir whir" like this

439
00:22:53,120 --> 00:22:57,840
If you're gonna bother doing that, you may as well wake up normally

440
00:22:56,200 --> 00:23:01,720
It's not just for that, I can use it for cooking, and there's lots of attachments

441
00:23:02,280 --> 00:23:04,720
It's not just a drill?

442
00:23:04,720 --> 00:23:08,600
Yeah, there's also a thread spool one

443
00:23:08,600 --> 00:23:10,040
A thread spool?

444
00:23:10,040 --> 00:23:12,320
Something to spool up the thread

445
00:23:12,800 --> 00:23:18,800
And also, a thing for whipping stuff

446
00:23:13,600 --> 00:23:15,240
Do you use that though?

447
00:23:19,320 --> 00:23:21,440
But you don't cook that often though

448
00:23:21,440 --> 00:23:26,000
Yeah the doctor laughed like "Now you can cook Matsumoto!" "GAHAHA"

449
00:23:26,000 --> 00:23:29,320
That was the master at the bar laughing

450
00:23:29,600 --> 00:23:31,320
Oh right, the master

451
00:23:31,680 --> 00:23:33,960
The master was listening on us the whole time

452
00:23:34,520 --> 00:23:39,400
And this is an inappropriate thing to say, but I can use it for that sort of thing too

453
00:23:38,520 --> 00:23:40,600
Oh?

454
00:23:40,600 --> 00:23:44,520
Yeah, the drill, if I put something on the tip of it

455
00:23:46,120 --> 00:23:51,200
I can use just the drill too though, like using the tip to *chin chin chin chin*

456
00:23:56,040 --> 00:24:00,120
You know, I was forced to lie,

457
00:24:00,120 --> 00:24:03,760
And when I get a little dirty, you guys egg me on,

458
00:24:03,760 --> 00:24:09,080
No no no, you could've ended the story earlier

459
00:24:03,990 --> 00:24:13,040
