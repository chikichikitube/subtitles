1
00:00:03,000 --> 00:00:07,200
Hamada and his juniors are in Pattaya, Thailand.

2
00:00:08,360 --> 00:00:14,450
I brought speakers. Let's listen to music.

3
00:00:14,530 --> 00:00:17,000
Yes, good idea.

4
00:00:17,700 --> 00:00:19,580
Can we play music?

5
00:00:19,660 --> 00:00:20,500
Sure.

6
00:00:20,660 --> 00:00:22,430
-He says OK.
-Thank you.

7
00:00:25,730 --> 00:00:29,120
-Good choice.
-It's "Easy Rider."

8
00:00:29,200 --> 00:00:30,780
It's perfect for a road trip.

9
00:00:30,860 --> 00:00:31,930
Tamio Okuda.

10
00:00:33,900 --> 00:00:35,660
It's a great travel song.

11
00:00:35,860 --> 00:00:38,250
It matches this scenery.

12
00:00:38,600 --> 00:00:40,100
It was used in a travel show.

13
00:00:40,300 --> 00:00:41,500
That's right.

14
00:00:49,800 --> 00:00:51,150
You're singing?

15
00:00:58,630 --> 00:01:00,360
You recorded your voice?

16
00:01:01,530 --> 00:01:05,460
I thought he was singing now.

17
00:01:05,660 --> 00:01:09,960
Me too. You recorded your own voice?

18
00:01:11,500 --> 00:01:13,800
You recorded your own singing?

19
00:01:17,430 --> 00:01:18,560
Yes, I did.

20
00:01:18,700 --> 00:01:20,100
You recorded this?

21
00:01:21,830 --> 00:01:26,820
We want to hear Tamio Okuda's version.

22
00:01:26,900 --> 00:01:27,880
I don't have it.

23
00:01:27,960 --> 00:01:29,660
You don't?

24
00:01:30,500 --> 00:01:31,600
Lousy!

25
00:01:33,060 --> 00:01:34,000
What is this?

26
00:01:34,360 --> 00:01:35,830
It's funny.

27
00:01:36,130 --> 00:01:37,030
It is.

28
00:01:40,780 --> 00:01:42,900
Seriously, what is this?

29
00:01:43,100 --> 00:01:44,900
Unbelievable.

30
00:01:45,460 --> 00:01:50,350
It's like we're on a bus tour, Hirai.

31
00:01:50,430 --> 00:01:53,760
Yes, a bus tour with fans.

32
00:01:56,260 --> 00:01:57,630
What is this?

33
00:01:59,330 --> 00:02:01,480
What's going on?

34
00:02:01,560 --> 00:02:03,430
It's a bus tour.

35
00:02:04,360 --> 00:02:08,160
Hamada's Holiday in Thailand

36
00:02:10,100 --> 00:02:13,280
These six comedians
have researched about Pattaya...

37
00:02:13,360 --> 00:02:15,360
...to pitch fun activities to Hamada.

38
00:02:16,900 --> 00:02:20,800
The group are staying
at the Mera Mare Pattaya,

39
00:02:20,930 --> 00:02:24,100
a four-star hotel that opened in 2016.

40
00:02:25,700 --> 00:02:28,930
Located on Pattaya's Beach Road,

41
00:02:29,130 --> 00:02:31,730
it's ideal for both business and leisure.

42
00:02:32,830 --> 00:02:37,800
It has 80 fully-equipped bedrooms
and luxurious suite rooms.

43
00:02:38,600 --> 00:02:42,460
This hotel was the basecamp for their trip.

44
00:02:44,630 --> 00:02:50,630
Let's see whose choice came in fifth place.

45
00:02:53,030 --> 00:02:54,220
Fifth place.

46
00:02:54,300 --> 00:02:58,950
Everyone, close your eyes
for your name to be called.

47
00:02:59,030 --> 00:03:00,800
There's a cash reward.

48
00:03:01,000 --> 00:03:01,840
Hamada.

49
00:03:02,000 --> 00:03:04,500
Fifth place gets 100 Baht.

50
00:03:04,800 --> 00:03:06,860
Fifth place goes to...

51
00:03:12,360 --> 00:03:13,200
Iwahashi.

52
00:03:14,100 --> 00:03:15,900
Iwahashi is fifth.

53
00:03:17,060 --> 00:03:18,480
It's a good result.

54
00:03:18,560 --> 00:03:22,000
Yes, I'm happy. Thank you.

55
00:03:23,900 --> 00:03:25,720
Aren't you happy?

56
00:03:25,800 --> 00:03:30,030
Well, it's fifth out of six people.

57
00:03:30,260 --> 00:03:35,180
So overall it's a low ranking.

58
00:03:35,260 --> 00:03:36,380
I'm happy, but I'm also...

59
00:03:36,460 --> 00:03:37,900
-Disappointed?
-Disappointed.

60
00:03:37,980 --> 00:03:40,430
But everyone was amazing.

61
00:03:41,060 --> 00:03:45,750
I thought of the best plan I could.

62
00:03:45,850 --> 00:03:47,330
Your presentation were great.

63
00:03:47,500 --> 00:03:49,450
-Really?
-You were.

64
00:03:49,530 --> 00:03:50,980
Really? I'm happy.

65
00:03:51,060 --> 00:03:54,680
There was an unexpected twist,

66
00:03:54,760 --> 00:03:57,500
but that last place felt very Thai.

67
00:03:57,700 --> 00:03:58,900
Very Thai?

68
00:03:59,200 --> 00:04:00,130
Thank you.

69
00:04:00,260 --> 00:04:01,230
It was great.

70
00:04:02,260 --> 00:04:03,920
Then why am I fifth?

71
00:04:04,000 --> 00:04:06,400
The rest was even better.

72
00:04:06,500 --> 00:04:08,800
Everyone's was better?

73
00:04:08,930 --> 00:04:10,530
You weren't bad.

74
00:04:12,000 --> 00:04:12,780
It's tough.

75
00:04:12,860 --> 00:04:15,630
Who are you talking to?

76
00:04:16,860 --> 00:04:18,380
Who's over there?

77
00:04:18,460 --> 00:04:20,200
Don't talk to the staff.

78
00:04:21,900 --> 00:04:24,430
You can't talk to the staff.

79
00:04:25,500 --> 00:04:31,360
Let's see Iwahashi's plan that ranked in fifth.

80
00:04:32,230 --> 00:04:33,680
Iwahashi, go ahead.

81
00:04:33,760 --> 00:04:34,600
Thank you.

82
00:04:34,830 --> 00:04:35,670
So...

83
00:04:35,800 --> 00:04:36,640
You're far away.

84
00:04:37,330 --> 00:04:38,860
I'll stand closer.

85
00:04:39,330 --> 00:04:44,900
Thailand is a hot country, so let's go to a pool.

86
00:04:45,700 --> 00:04:50,620
It's gigantic. I mean it, it's huge.

87
00:04:50,700 --> 00:04:52,000
Really?

88
00:04:52,260 --> 00:04:58,260
There's a 23-meter water slider,
which you slide down

89
00:04:58,400 --> 00:05:00,200
in two seconds.

90
00:05:00,360 --> 00:05:01,700
That's steep!

91
00:05:01,860 --> 00:05:02,800
Two seconds?

92
00:05:03,430 --> 00:05:05,900
It's basically a theme park.

93
00:05:06,530 --> 00:05:12,250
Just like Disneyland,
you can spend the whole day there.

94
00:05:12,390 --> 00:05:13,430
Take a look.

95
00:05:14,330 --> 00:05:16,350
It's enormous.

96
00:05:16,430 --> 00:05:17,600
It's huge.

97
00:05:18,130 --> 00:05:23,700
Hamada, you're not well known here,
so you can let loose.

98
00:05:24,030 --> 00:05:28,000
It would be great for kids.

99
00:05:28,100 --> 00:05:29,160
You can let loose.

100
00:05:30,530 --> 00:05:31,700
Like this.

101
00:05:39,300 --> 00:05:40,860
You're angry?

102
00:05:41,700 --> 00:05:42,960
Nobody was stopping him.

103
00:05:44,530 --> 00:05:48,160
-How about it?
-A pool? I don't know...

104
00:05:50,430 --> 00:05:51,280
It is hot.

105
00:05:51,360 --> 00:05:54,430
We can be kids again.

106
00:05:54,800 --> 00:05:56,630
There are 150 pools,

107
00:05:56,730 --> 00:06:01,530
divided into ten different zones.

108
00:06:03,400 --> 00:06:04,860
What are you saying?

109
00:06:06,960 --> 00:06:09,530
Please explain with words.

110
00:06:09,700 --> 00:06:13,730
Just like aquariums are divided
into themed areas,

111
00:06:13,830 --> 00:06:18,020
the pools are divided into ten categories.

112
00:06:18,100 --> 00:06:20,600
And the ten categories...

113
00:06:24,800 --> 00:06:26,300
Be serious.

114
00:06:26,500 --> 00:06:28,320
It'll be fun.

115
00:06:28,400 --> 00:06:30,650
Can you wear a swimsuit?

116
00:06:30,730 --> 00:06:34,230
No problem. Look at this.

117
00:06:35,230 --> 00:06:37,030
Isn't it big?

118
00:06:37,330 --> 00:06:38,500
I'm carrying four babies.

119
00:06:38,630 --> 00:06:39,960
-Four?
-Four.

120
00:06:40,200 --> 00:06:42,400
Four babies in my belly.

121
00:06:42,500 --> 00:06:43,930
-Four?
-Four.

122
00:06:44,060 --> 00:06:46,930
Three babies, two babies, one baby...

123
00:06:47,100 --> 00:06:48,730
...and four babies.

124
00:06:50,930 --> 00:06:52,060
Cut it out.

125
00:06:53,960 --> 00:06:55,430
Stop it.

126
00:06:57,430 --> 00:06:59,560
Let's go to the pool.

127
00:07:00,530 --> 00:07:04,130
It'll be fun. We should go.

128
00:07:04,260 --> 00:07:05,250
Any other options?

129
00:07:05,330 --> 00:07:08,700
OK, we'll put a pin in this.

130
00:07:09,430 --> 00:07:12,830
I tried Thai food, which is great.

131
00:07:13,000 --> 00:07:14,630
Especially Khao Man Gai.

132
00:07:15,100 --> 00:07:19,600
It's fried rice topped with chicken.

133
00:07:19,720 --> 00:07:21,280
It's popular.

134
00:07:21,360 --> 00:07:26,700
I found the best Khao Man Gai
in all of Thailand.

135
00:07:26,800 --> 00:07:31,260
You can get it with chicken,

136
00:07:31,360 --> 00:07:34,800
or with pork or duck.

137
00:07:34,900 --> 00:07:38,000
A set with soup costs just 100 Baht.

138
00:07:38,500 --> 00:07:41,320
-It's delicious.
-It's cheap.

139
00:07:41,400 --> 00:07:47,100
It's so good, you can eat it even if you're full.

140
00:07:47,530 --> 00:07:51,800
Even if you're stuffed, you'll want to eat.

141
00:07:54,160 --> 00:07:55,000
Keep talking.

142
00:07:55,080 --> 00:07:58,130
Why do you laugh in the middle?

143
00:07:58,300 --> 00:07:59,960
We're listening.

144
00:08:00,200 --> 00:08:01,130
Seriously...

145
00:08:01,530 --> 00:08:03,060
Don't make pit stops.

146
00:08:03,230 --> 00:08:08,620
We're comedians, so it's no fun
if we just go and eat.

147
00:08:08,700 --> 00:08:12,700
Let's draw straws to see who eats what.

148
00:08:13,460 --> 00:08:15,230
That's suspenseful.

149
00:08:16,600 --> 00:08:18,500
There's a varied menu.

150
00:08:18,830 --> 00:08:24,200
Hamada definitely needs to eat
the most popular dish.

151
00:08:24,400 --> 00:08:28,400
So he gets the Khao Man Gai and soup set.

152
00:08:28,630 --> 00:08:30,760
Any objections?

153
00:08:31,060 --> 00:08:31,980
I'll take this.

154
00:08:32,060 --> 00:08:33,620
If he can't eat...

155
00:08:33,700 --> 00:08:35,900
Your plan will be pointless.

156
00:08:36,160 --> 00:08:37,220
Let them draw.

157
00:08:37,300 --> 00:08:42,500
Please pick. It has the menu item you can eat.

158
00:08:43,030 --> 00:08:45,430
Please draw at once.

159
00:08:45,630 --> 00:08:47,300
-Go ahead.
-What about you?

160
00:08:47,380 --> 00:08:48,760
This one's mine.

161
00:08:49,830 --> 00:08:54,930
I get Khao Man Gai, like Hamada. Thanks!

162
00:08:55,800 --> 00:08:59,250
-Inomoto, you get Khao Na Ped, with duck.
-Duck?

163
00:08:59,350 --> 00:09:00,930
It's also popular.

164
00:09:01,300 --> 00:09:03,750
Seshita gets soup only.

165
00:09:03,830 --> 00:09:05,550
Seriously?

166
00:09:05,630 --> 00:09:06,860
The weirdo gets nothing.

167
00:09:08,540 --> 00:09:09,380
I'm Masayoshi.

168
00:09:09,460 --> 00:09:11,880
He's your senior.

169
00:09:11,960 --> 00:09:15,400
"The weirdo gets nothing?"

170
00:09:15,700 --> 00:09:17,060
And Taiki...

171
00:09:17,160 --> 00:09:22,860
This is pork, which some say
is better than the chicken.

172
00:09:23,000 --> 00:09:23,840
And you.

173
00:09:24,500 --> 00:09:25,460
Japanese meal.

174
00:09:26,000 --> 00:09:26,930
What?

175
00:09:27,080 --> 00:09:31,660
You get a rice ball that I got in Japan.

176
00:09:31,830 --> 00:09:33,680
I don't want it!

177
00:09:33,760 --> 00:09:35,230
It's from Haneda Airport.

178
00:09:35,330 --> 00:09:37,400
What is that?

179
00:09:37,800 --> 00:09:42,200
Wait, this expired three days ago.

180
00:09:43,430 --> 00:09:44,950
He can't eat that.

181
00:09:45,030 --> 00:09:47,580
It's fine. I kept it refrigerated.

182
00:09:47,660 --> 00:09:49,930
This is what we're eating.

183
00:09:50,100 --> 00:09:52,130
-Khao Man Gai.
-Khao Man Gai.

184
00:09:52,960 --> 00:09:54,500
It's delicious.

185
00:09:55,230 --> 00:09:56,960
OK, let's go!

186
00:09:58,660 --> 00:10:00,830
What about us?

187
00:10:04,860 --> 00:10:06,030
Congrats!

188
00:10:06,160 --> 00:10:07,300
It's a miracle!

189
00:10:09,530 --> 00:10:12,800
-You thought he'd say no?
-Absolutely!

190
00:10:13,460 --> 00:10:15,930
Khao Man Gai is the winner.

191
00:10:16,060 --> 00:10:20,160
I was up until four making these.

192
00:10:20,900 --> 00:10:22,130
I'm relieved.

193
00:10:22,330 --> 00:10:24,900
Let's go. Let's eat chicken.

194
00:10:26,100 --> 00:10:28,060
Everyone eats except the weirdo.

195
00:10:28,860 --> 00:10:30,330
That one's good.

196
00:10:30,500 --> 00:10:32,000
Yours too.

197
00:10:32,630 --> 00:10:35,900
You really thought he'd refuse.

198
00:10:37,000 --> 00:10:38,560
I'm so happy!

199
00:10:41,600 --> 00:10:43,230
I could kill someone.

200
00:10:45,430 --> 00:10:46,560
No you can't.

201
00:10:47,310 --> 00:10:48,150
Let's go!

202
00:10:48,230 --> 00:10:51,100
He's so loud, from start to end.

203
00:10:52,730 --> 00:10:57,530
And so, they head out for
the best Khao Man Gai in Thailand.

204
00:10:59,060 --> 00:11:00,300
We're here.

205
00:11:00,760 --> 00:11:04,730
They serve the best Khao Man Gai in Thailand.

206
00:11:05,360 --> 00:11:06,850
It's pretty casual.

207
00:11:06,930 --> 00:11:08,330
It feels very local.

208
00:11:08,460 --> 00:11:10,830
This soup is really good.

209
00:11:11,560 --> 00:11:13,130
It's not too crowded.

210
00:11:14,530 --> 00:11:16,260
Two Khao Man Gai.

211
00:11:19,860 --> 00:11:21,530
Two chicken.

212
00:11:22,930 --> 00:11:26,100
They only have pork and duck.

213
00:11:26,560 --> 00:11:28,860
Only pork and duck?

214
00:11:29,360 --> 00:11:30,900
This is awkward.

215
00:11:32,860 --> 00:11:33,830
Really?

216
00:11:34,130 --> 00:11:35,320
Serious?

217
00:11:35,400 --> 00:11:38,220
Didn't we come for the Khao Man Gai?

218
00:11:38,300 --> 00:11:39,900
No Khao Man Gai?

219
00:11:40,250 --> 00:11:43,850
-It's sold out.
-You're sold out?

220
00:11:45,460 --> 00:11:48,130
He's so unlucky.

221
00:11:48,580 --> 00:11:50,830
Pork is actually the best.

222
00:11:51,060 --> 00:11:52,260
Liar!

223
00:11:52,630 --> 00:11:58,400
The real foodies say pork is actually the best.

224
00:11:59,100 --> 00:12:00,360
Let me explain...

225
00:12:00,700 --> 00:12:02,260
We want to try the basics.

226
00:12:03,660 --> 00:12:06,460
Hamada's card said chicken.

227
00:12:06,830 --> 00:12:08,900
He'll get pork.

228
00:12:09,930 --> 00:12:11,430
I had pork.

229
00:12:11,560 --> 00:12:12,750
You get pork.

230
00:12:12,830 --> 00:12:14,500
-And me?
-Rice ball.

231
00:12:15,930 --> 00:12:17,430
-And me?
-Nothing.

232
00:12:18,660 --> 00:12:20,250
Will you take pork?

233
00:12:20,330 --> 00:12:24,100
Chicken is the most famous,

234
00:12:24,630 --> 00:12:29,400
but the regulars here say pork is the best.

235
00:12:29,700 --> 00:12:30,820
But you wanted chicken.

236
00:12:30,900 --> 00:12:32,000
I wanted chicken.

237
00:12:34,700 --> 00:12:35,540
Let's go.

238
00:12:36,430 --> 00:12:39,660
Will you at least try the soup?

239
00:12:40,130 --> 00:12:41,530
It's really good.

240
00:12:41,660 --> 00:12:45,030
-Thank you.
-The soup is really good.

241
00:12:47,360 --> 00:12:48,200
The soup...

242
00:12:48,960 --> 00:12:50,330
Is this it?

243
00:12:51,700 --> 00:12:52,660
Seriously?

244
00:12:55,060 --> 00:12:59,550
We went, but they were sold out.

245
00:12:59,660 --> 00:13:01,250
Iwahashi sums up the day...

246
00:13:01,330 --> 00:13:07,400
I'd assumed the staff would have taken care of it.

247
00:13:08,030 --> 00:13:11,630
I should have checked
how much chicken they had left.

248
00:13:12,360 --> 00:13:18,030
This is a true documentary with no fakes.

249
00:13:18,730 --> 00:13:21,460
They didn't have what you presented.

250
00:13:21,760 --> 00:13:27,460
I'm really embarrassed this happened.

251
00:13:27,660 --> 00:13:29,280
I wanted you to try it.

252
00:13:29,360 --> 00:13:31,460
So did we.

253
00:13:31,900 --> 00:13:33,660
What will we do now?

254
00:13:34,230 --> 00:13:38,130
Let's go to a temple to shed our earthly desires.

255
00:13:38,640 --> 00:13:39,880
What's it like?

256
00:13:39,960 --> 00:13:41,930
They have a Buddha that's like this.

257
00:13:42,660 --> 00:13:44,560
It's sleeping?

258
00:13:45,060 --> 00:13:46,000
No, it's not.

259
00:13:46,230 --> 00:13:49,160
I apologize for the confusion.

260
00:13:51,560 --> 00:13:52,930
Let's just go.

261
00:13:53,360 --> 00:13:54,860
Let's go. I'm sorry.

262
00:13:55,260 --> 00:13:57,600
That was really awkward.

263
00:13:58,900 --> 00:14:02,730
Iwahashi had also planned on visiting a temple.

264
00:14:05,760 --> 00:14:06,620
I'll take those.

265
00:14:06,700 --> 00:14:08,400
You want them back?

266
00:14:09,230 --> 00:14:10,250
You had three ideas.

267
00:14:10,330 --> 00:14:11,700
We already decided.

268
00:14:12,000 --> 00:14:13,320
What's your third idea?

269
00:14:13,400 --> 00:14:14,160
Really?

270
00:14:14,260 --> 00:14:16,060
We might have time to go.

271
00:14:16,200 --> 00:14:17,760
Oh yeah. I'm sorry.

272
00:14:18,130 --> 00:14:19,330
So...

273
00:14:19,460 --> 00:14:22,860
-I was rude.
-You were.

274
00:14:23,560 --> 00:14:25,200
Just tell us.

275
00:14:25,360 --> 00:14:26,200
We have time.

276
00:14:26,560 --> 00:14:28,280
I was just so relieved.

277
00:14:28,360 --> 00:14:29,600
There's still time.

278
00:14:29,760 --> 00:14:34,600
I was irritated because
that old man told me to keep talking.

279
00:14:34,760 --> 00:14:39,100
Don't call him "old man."

280
00:14:40,260 --> 00:14:44,930
Thailand is a Buddhist country,
so let's go to a temple.

281
00:14:45,130 --> 00:14:45,970
A temple?

282
00:14:46,060 --> 00:14:51,230
Otherwise it's like going to Disneyland
and not seeing Mickey.

283
00:14:51,600 --> 00:14:54,960
Let's go to Thailand's most popular temple.

284
00:14:55,100 --> 00:14:58,950
There's a golden Buddha, three times the size...

285
00:14:59,030 --> 00:15:02,860
...of the Buddha at Todaiji Temple in Nara.

286
00:15:05,460 --> 00:15:07,230
It's sleeping?

287
00:15:08,560 --> 00:15:13,000
No it's not, and I apologize for the confusion.

288
00:15:13,260 --> 00:15:16,350
-It's not sleeping?
-No, it's sitting.

289
00:15:16,430 --> 00:15:17,850
What does it look like?

290
00:15:17,930 --> 00:15:19,060
Like this.

291
00:15:21,560 --> 00:15:23,400
It's sleeping?

292
00:15:24,000 --> 00:15:25,700
No, it's not.

293
00:15:26,200 --> 00:15:28,160
All the tourists go there.

294
00:15:28,360 --> 00:15:29,420
In Thailand...

295
00:15:29,500 --> 00:15:31,420
Everyone goes there.

296
00:15:31,500 --> 00:15:34,330
-It's a spiritual spot?
-Absolutely.

297
00:15:34,460 --> 00:15:39,030
In Thailand, people know
the day of the week they were born on.

298
00:15:39,260 --> 00:15:42,560
The temple has a Buddha for each day of the week,

299
00:15:43,160 --> 00:15:48,400
and people pray in front of their Buddha.

300
00:15:48,760 --> 00:15:51,760
That Buddha will protect them.

301
00:15:52,360 --> 00:15:57,760
We should go there and pray to our Buddhas,

302
00:15:58,000 --> 00:16:01,650
but we won't know which day to pray for.

303
00:16:02,100 --> 00:16:04,400
-I looked it up!
-Incredible!

304
00:16:04,960 --> 00:16:06,230
Really?

305
00:16:06,860 --> 00:16:07,580
Here we go.

306
00:16:07,660 --> 00:16:08,600
Really?

307
00:16:10,800 --> 00:16:13,300
Hamada, you were born on Saturday.

308
00:16:14,860 --> 00:16:15,620
Saturday.

309
00:16:15,700 --> 00:16:16,800
Really?

310
00:16:17,800 --> 00:16:20,460
Please pray to the Saturday Buddha.

311
00:16:20,660 --> 00:16:24,000
Hirai was born on Sunday.

312
00:16:24,130 --> 00:16:24,970
Sunday?

313
00:16:26,630 --> 00:16:28,200
Really? Sunday?

314
00:16:29,500 --> 00:16:31,800
Taiki was born on Sunday.

315
00:16:32,300 --> 00:16:33,700
Sunday for you two.

316
00:16:35,600 --> 00:16:39,200
Masayoshi was born on Friday.

317
00:16:39,330 --> 00:16:40,900
On Friday.

318
00:16:42,260 --> 00:16:43,360
I made a mistake.

319
00:16:46,160 --> 00:16:47,360
Tear that out.

320
00:16:49,200 --> 00:16:50,700
You don't need that.

321
00:16:50,830 --> 00:16:52,700
If it's a mistake, tear it out.

322
00:16:53,330 --> 00:16:55,120
I have my reasons.

323
00:16:55,200 --> 00:16:58,000
Seshita was born on Sunday.

324
00:16:59,600 --> 00:17:01,460
I was born on Saturday.

325
00:17:01,600 --> 00:17:02,560
Like me.

326
00:17:03,160 --> 00:17:05,020
Please remember yours.

327
00:17:05,100 --> 00:17:06,300
What about me?

328
00:17:07,060 --> 00:17:08,500
I have no idea.

329
00:17:11,130 --> 00:17:12,900
What's with you?

330
00:17:13,160 --> 00:17:14,280
And you're my senior.

331
00:17:14,360 --> 00:17:15,250
Look mine up!

332
00:17:15,330 --> 00:17:16,760
I did.

333
00:17:17,130 --> 00:17:18,860
You were born on Friday.

334
00:17:19,430 --> 00:17:24,200
Have you noticed the pattern?

335
00:17:24,360 --> 00:17:25,760
We're all old men.

336
00:17:27,060 --> 00:17:28,230
I'm just kidding.

337
00:17:34,660 --> 00:17:39,250
I was laughing last night. Just kidding.

338
00:17:39,330 --> 00:17:40,250
It was OK until there.

339
00:17:40,330 --> 00:17:41,830
Sorry about that.

340
00:17:42,000 --> 00:17:44,300
We're all born on the weekend.

341
00:17:45,100 --> 00:17:46,360
Yes, so...

342
00:17:46,830 --> 00:17:48,800
Weekend, weekend, weekend!

343
00:17:49,030 --> 00:17:54,330
Weekend, weekend, weekend...

344
00:17:54,430 --> 00:17:55,430
Be quiet!

345
00:17:56,830 --> 00:17:58,130
You're loud.

346
00:17:58,500 --> 00:18:02,500
So we're Team Weekend! Let's go!

347
00:18:02,930 --> 00:18:03,960
Let's go!

348
00:18:04,560 --> 00:18:06,530
-Foreign country people!
-Enough!

349
00:18:07,930 --> 00:18:08,960
That's enough.

350
00:18:09,060 --> 00:18:10,380
Let's go.

351
00:18:10,460 --> 00:18:11,660
Shall we go?

352
00:18:11,830 --> 00:18:15,560
We're all born on the weekend.

353
00:18:15,830 --> 00:18:19,300
Nobody was born Monday to Thursday.

354
00:18:19,760 --> 00:18:20,800
It's a miracle.

355
00:18:21,200 --> 00:18:24,060
If the Khao Man Gai's good, we can go.

356
00:18:24,760 --> 00:18:26,160
Sounds good.

357
00:18:26,300 --> 00:18:27,660
So restaurant first.

358
00:18:28,600 --> 00:18:29,440
Let's go.

359
00:18:30,500 --> 00:18:33,000
But the Khao Man Gai was sold out,

360
00:18:33,630 --> 00:18:37,100
so they head to the temple.

361
00:18:39,030 --> 00:18:40,530
It's huge.

362
00:18:40,660 --> 00:18:41,500
Wow.

363
00:18:42,100 --> 00:18:43,620
I want a photo.

364
00:18:43,700 --> 00:18:44,600
Photography is allowed.

365
00:18:44,730 --> 00:18:47,160
Let's take one from here.

366
00:18:47,500 --> 00:18:48,660
A group photo.

367
00:18:48,930 --> 00:18:52,600
It's three times the size of Nara's Buddha.

368
00:18:52,730 --> 00:18:53,700
I'll take a one.

369
00:18:53,830 --> 00:18:54,800
It's beautiful.

370
00:18:55,830 --> 00:18:56,800
You should join.

371
00:18:57,260 --> 00:19:00,530
I'll take one first, to see how it looks.

372
00:19:08,000 --> 00:19:09,460
A video?

373
00:19:10,100 --> 00:19:12,030
Not a photo?

374
00:19:13,700 --> 00:19:14,930
It was video mode.

375
00:19:15,860 --> 00:19:16,700
Sorry.

376
00:19:23,100 --> 00:19:24,600
A video?

377
00:19:25,230 --> 00:19:27,130
Not a photo?

378
00:19:28,530 --> 00:19:29,560
It was video mode.

379
00:19:30,800 --> 00:19:31,640
Sorry.

380
00:19:31,930 --> 00:19:33,700
Could you take it?

381
00:19:38,200 --> 00:19:39,460
Thank you!

382
00:19:41,960 --> 00:19:46,550
The group arrived at Pattaya's largest temple,

383
00:19:46,630 --> 00:19:48,100
Wat Phra Yai.

384
00:19:49,660 --> 00:19:53,080
Numerous bells line the entrance,

385
00:19:53,160 --> 00:19:57,730
which can be rung
to wash away earthly desires.

386
00:19:58,700 --> 00:20:04,230
Known as "the Big Buddha,"
it's a major tourist site in Pattaya.

387
00:20:06,130 --> 00:20:07,380
This is amazing.

388
00:20:07,460 --> 00:20:11,260
It's a must-see in Thailand.

389
00:20:11,830 --> 00:20:14,060
We're on the snake path.

390
00:20:14,200 --> 00:20:18,550
These mythical snakes are protecting us.

391
00:20:18,630 --> 00:20:20,630
Even from here, it's big.

392
00:20:20,860 --> 00:20:22,830
-It's huge.
-Amazing.

393
00:20:22,960 --> 00:20:28,730
It's the most popular temple
in Thailand for foreign tourists.

394
00:20:29,100 --> 00:20:33,330
It's a holy place, like a Japanese shrine.

395
00:20:34,330 --> 00:20:36,200
Please be respectful.

396
00:20:36,530 --> 00:20:38,260
Look at the size.

397
00:20:39,230 --> 00:20:41,160
That's incredible.

398
00:20:42,800 --> 00:20:45,060
It's not sleeping at all.

399
00:20:45,260 --> 00:20:47,260
I was trying to express this,

400
00:20:47,430 --> 00:20:49,800
but I'm so fat I rolled over.

401
00:20:50,530 --> 00:20:52,330
There are many types.

402
00:20:52,760 --> 00:20:54,480
There's so many.

403
00:20:54,560 --> 00:20:56,660
Look, it's Iwahashi.

404
00:20:57,530 --> 00:20:59,330
They threw something.

405
00:20:59,530 --> 00:21:02,530
Yes, into the belly button.

406
00:21:03,560 --> 00:21:08,360
You can overlook the city from here,

407
00:21:08,530 --> 00:21:11,260
another reason why it's popular.

408
00:21:12,600 --> 00:21:14,060
This is Pattaya City.

409
00:21:14,200 --> 00:21:15,100
Wow.

410
00:21:15,300 --> 00:21:17,160
It's cloudy today.

411
00:21:17,860 --> 00:21:19,300
There's a lot of smog.

412
00:21:19,630 --> 00:21:20,660
That's smog?

413
00:21:21,130 --> 00:21:26,530
They also sell sparrows that you release
to increase your virtue.

414
00:21:27,650 --> 00:21:29,360
That's interesting.

415
00:21:29,500 --> 00:21:32,860
Different countries have different customs.

416
00:21:34,930 --> 00:21:40,930
The Big Buddha is surrounded
by the Buddhas for each day of the week.

417
00:21:42,800 --> 00:21:45,030
Let's see the other Buddhas.

418
00:21:46,400 --> 00:21:47,150
Friday.

419
00:21:47,230 --> 00:21:50,730
Here's the Friday Buddha,
for Masayoshi and Inomoto.

420
00:21:50,830 --> 00:21:52,100
You should pray.

421
00:21:52,660 --> 00:21:53,730
Inomoto.

422
00:21:55,160 --> 00:21:56,730
I want to be more on TV.

423
00:21:57,530 --> 00:21:59,400
I want a documentary made about me.

424
00:22:01,200 --> 00:22:02,700
Not Downtown's show?

425
00:22:03,000 --> 00:22:05,950
Why? I don't get it.

426
00:22:06,030 --> 00:22:08,100
-Saturday and Sunday's Buddha are over here.
-Okay.

427
00:22:08,400 --> 00:22:12,700
Hirai, Taiki and Seshita were born on Sunday.

428
00:22:13,160 --> 00:22:15,360
Go ahead and pray.

429
00:22:17,000 --> 00:22:19,060
Give us more warm-up comedy work.

430
00:22:21,900 --> 00:22:22,860
Likewise.

431
00:22:24,760 --> 00:22:26,430
I hope I become more famous.

432
00:22:29,800 --> 00:22:33,500
-Let's go to the Saturday Buddha.
-Saturday.

433
00:22:33,930 --> 00:22:35,830
That's for me and Hamada.

434
00:22:36,200 --> 00:22:38,060
Let's pray.

435
00:22:42,200 --> 00:22:43,230
Go ahead.

436
00:22:43,330 --> 00:22:44,900
I want to be on more TV shows.

437
00:22:45,000 --> 00:22:48,580
Really, do you mean that?

438
00:22:48,660 --> 00:22:52,050
I'm sure you have enough programs.

439
00:22:52,130 --> 00:22:54,330
Can't you get us on your shows?

440
00:22:55,360 --> 00:22:57,630
Please, master.

441
00:22:58,030 --> 00:23:00,360
You can't be serious.

442
00:23:00,930 --> 00:23:05,030
Not all TV channels like me.

443
00:23:05,760 --> 00:23:09,560
Let's just pray for good health.

444
00:23:11,500 --> 00:23:16,600
Finally, the group prayed to the Big Buddha.

445
00:23:19,800 --> 00:23:25,800
They experienced
the true Buddhist culture of Thailand.

446
00:23:29,160 --> 00:23:30,080
That was great.

447
00:23:30,160 --> 00:23:31,980
It was really amazing.

448
00:23:32,060 --> 00:23:34,420
I'm glad you enjoyed it.

449
00:23:34,500 --> 00:23:35,730
It was very Thai.

450
00:23:36,100 --> 00:23:40,260
Yes, it was a very Thai experience. That's nice.

451
00:23:40,360 --> 00:23:43,800
-Back to you.
-Who are you talking to?

452
00:23:43,930 --> 00:23:45,150
There's only us.

453
00:23:45,900 --> 00:23:47,350
Don't talk to the staff.

454
00:23:48,000 --> 00:23:52,530
They listen to more songs recorded by Hirai.

455
00:23:55,360 --> 00:23:56,450
Who is this?

456
00:23:59,760 --> 00:24:01,160
It's perfect.

457
00:24:01,400 --> 00:24:02,660
It's a great song.

458
00:24:03,100 --> 00:24:04,700
It's your song.

459
00:24:04,900 --> 00:24:06,100
It's a bit awkward.

460
00:24:06,460 --> 00:24:09,760
It is, but it's perfect for this hot weather.

461
00:24:12,440 --> 00:24:13,420
Turn it up.

462
00:24:13,500 --> 00:24:14,530
This is a good one.

463
00:24:20,300 --> 00:24:21,200
It's his song.

464
00:24:22,200 --> 00:24:23,730
You're shameless.

465
00:24:24,200 --> 00:24:26,830
The real singer is here.

466
00:24:29,260 --> 00:24:30,960
What an awful singer.

467
00:24:32,900 --> 00:24:36,000
No one wants to hear this.

468
00:24:40,230 --> 00:24:42,130
Are you making fun of me?

469
00:24:43,260 --> 00:24:45,520
He's mimicking you.

470
00:24:45,600 --> 00:24:47,930
It's the way he's singing.

471
00:24:49,430 --> 00:24:51,330
You changed your voice.

472
00:24:51,500 --> 00:24:54,500
You were different in the last song.

473
00:24:59,030 --> 00:25:01,080
What's that?

474
00:25:01,160 --> 00:25:02,800
He's doing the live version.

475
00:25:03,100 --> 00:25:08,220
You're making fun of me, aren't you?

476
00:25:08,300 --> 00:25:10,030
You're teasing him.

477
00:25:10,130 --> 00:25:11,830
He's mocking you.

478
00:25:12,160 --> 00:25:16,160
The actual singer is here. Are you crazy?
