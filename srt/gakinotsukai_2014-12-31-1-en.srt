You CAN'T do that!!

48
00:00:55,610 --> 00:01:01,910

We're really gonna do this, right?

98

Tsukitei Housei

99
00:01:42,710 --> 00:01:43,580
Yeah!

100
00:01:43,850 --> 00:01:44,880
Yes, yes we will

101
00:01:44,910 --> 00:01:46,610
This is NTV's 9th consecutive

102
00:01:46,610 --> 00:01:48,550
"Gaki no Tsukai"  welcoming of the new year

103

Before we know it, we will have crossed into the new year

104
00:01:49,310 --> 00:01:51,480
Before we know it, we will have crossed into the new year

105
00:01:50,910 --> 00:01:51,880
That is right

106
00:01:51,780 --> 00:01:52,850
Well

107
00:01:52,850 --> 00:01:54,510
This year is a good turning point

108
00:01:54,510 --> 00:01:56,050
so I think I’d like to end this series on this one

109
00:01:57,750 --> 00:01:59,210
Turning point?

110
00:01:58,910 --> 00:02:00,510
WHY DON'T YOU TRY?!

111
00:02:01,610 --> 00:02:03,580
I dare you to try!!

112
00:02:03,580 --> 00:02:04,080
You try and steer this ship!!

113
00:02:04,080 --> 00:02:05,810
You try and steer this ship!!

114
00:02:05,810 --> 00:02:07,610
Nagabuchi-san

115
00:02:05,810 --> 00:02:08,850
Notes: Nagabuchi Tsuyoshi is a Japanese rock singer with a distinct coarse voice.

116
00:02:06,310 --> 00:02:07,450
Okay

117
00:02:07,750 --> 00:02:09,410
Well then really...

118
00:02:09,410 --> 00:02:10,110
How was watching it?

119
00:02:10,110 --> 00:02:12,350
Watching?

120
00:02:12,350 --> 00:02:14,610
We haven't seen anything yet

121
00:02:14,610 --> 00:02:17,180
Talk as if you've seen it

122
00:02:15,880 --> 00:02:16,910
As if I've seen it?

123
00:02:17,180 --> 00:02:17,750
If we can film the ending

124
00:02:17,750 --> 00:02:20,180
we can just go home!!

125
00:02:20,910 --> 00:02:23,150
The poor audience... they came all the way here to watch!

126
00:02:23,550 --> 00:02:25,210
That's okay. They can stay and watch.

127
00:02:25,680 --> 00:02:27,050
Without further ado,

128
00:02:27,050 --> 00:02:28,010
let's start

129
00:02:27,050 --> 00:02:28,210
Let's start then

130
00:02:28,010 --> 00:02:30,350
Matsumoto, your VTR cue

131
00:02:29,450 --> 00:02:30,350
if you would, please

132
00:02:30,050 --> 00:02:30,850
Hurray!

133
00:02:31,780 --> 00:02:35,010
Go already

134
00:02:32,450 --> 00:02:35,010
go

135
00:02:32,650 --> 00:02:36,880
Notes: Matsumoto is imitating Nippon Electric Rengou, a Japanese female comedian duo who says, "Dame yo, dame dame"

136
00:02:32,680 --> 00:02:35,010
go

137
00:02:35,010 --> 00:02:36,880
What a rip off

138
00:02:37,110 --> 00:02:41,950
No Laughing Great Prison Escape

139
00:02:38,210 --> 00:02:39,280
It's started!

140
00:02:42,450 --> 00:02:46,950
Morning glow

141
00:02:43,580 --> 00:02:44,950
As the morning glow dyes the sky red

142
00:02:44,950 --> 00:02:47,080
As the morning glow dyes the sky red

143
00:02:46,980 --> 00:02:51,910
A gentle welcome

144
00:02:48,250 --> 00:02:50,310
The forest trees give the guys a gentle welcome

145
00:02:50,310 --> 00:02:52,850
The forest trees give the guys a gentle welcome

146
00:02:54,580 --> 00:02:58,450
Seriously, they should increase the number of people here

147
00:02:57,110 --> 00:02:58,650
Oh, so not just 5 of us

148
00:02:58,650 --> 00:03:00,450
Not just the 5 of us

149
00:03:00,450 --> 00:03:02,880
They should make it around 60 people

150
00:03:03,380 --> 00:03:06,450
I really think Hamada alone is good enough

151
00:03:04,850 --> 00:03:06,750
What the hell

152
00:03:06,950 --> 00:03:08,050
Oh, but

153
00:03:07,150 --> 00:03:08,050
What the hell...

154
00:03:08,080 --> 00:03:09,980
that's a good idea

155
00:03:09,680 --> 00:03:11,010
No "buts"

156
00:03:11,010 --> 00:03:11,910
What should we do?

157
00:03:11,350 --> 00:03:12,680
No "buts", just no

158
00:03:12,680 --> 00:03:14,850
You know, just by judging that reaction,

159
00:03:14,850 --> 00:03:17,610
he's not that against it

160
00:03:15,810 --> 00:03:17,350
That's true!

161
00:03:16,910 --> 00:03:17,710
You're right

162
00:03:18,450 --> 00:03:19,980
It does seem that way

163
00:03:18,810 --> 00:03:20,480
There's no way

164
00:03:20,980 --> 00:03:22,950
He'll say to his wife with a smile,

165
00:03:23,210 --> 00:03:27,280
"I did it by myself"

166
00:03:27,810 --> 00:03:28,650
It says "Wait here!!"

167
00:03:28,650 --> 00:03:31,150
It says "Wait here!!"

168
00:03:31,280 --> 00:03:32,280
What's this?

169
00:03:31,780 --> 00:03:33,410
I hate seeing that changing box

170
00:03:33,180 --> 00:03:37,250
Wait here!!

171
00:03:33,210 --> 00:03:34,350
It's cold

172
00:03:33,880 --> 00:03:35,210
It's so cold in there!

173
00:03:34,050 --> 00:03:34,750
It's cold

174
00:03:35,510 --> 00:03:37,250
It only just started getting cold from today

175
00:03:37,550 --> 00:03:40,280
It always gets so cold for this occasion

176
00:03:39,480 --> 00:03:41,050
I want to go home

177
00:03:41,350 --> 00:03:43,780
You've been complaining the entire time

178
00:03:43,980 --> 00:03:45,910
Matsumoto, you're pretty good

179
00:03:45,910 --> 00:03:48,310
Well, you know, I did a complaining performance

180
00:03:48,310 --> 00:03:49,710
It wasn't really much of a big deal though

181
00:03:49,710 --> 00:03:50,850
You're complaining as part of your comedy?

182
00:03:55,550 --> 00:03:58,480
Cheerleaders arrive

183
00:04:01,150 --> 00:04:01,910
Hamada Matsumoto

184
00:04:01,910 --> 00:04:03,950
Hamada Matsumoto

185
00:04:02,510 --> 00:04:03,780
What is this?

186
00:04:04,150 --> 00:04:04,850
Endo Tanaka

187
00:04:04,850 --> 00:04:07,810
Endo Tanaka

188
00:04:05,050 --> 00:04:06,580
He can't concentrate

189
00:04:12,980 --> 00:04:14,380
Hamada Matsumoto

190
00:04:14,380 --> 00:04:18,710
Hamada Matsumoto

191
00:04:16,510 --> 00:04:18,280
Looks like they're doing something

192
00:04:18,710 --> 00:04:20,080
Endo Tanaka

193
00:04:20,080 --> 00:04:22,610
Endo Tanaka

194
00:04:22,610 --> 00:04:27,210
Cheering for the stars of the show

195
00:04:27,210 --> 00:04:30,450
They don't say my name, huh

196
00:04:29,210 --> 00:04:31,610
Well, you know

197
00:04:30,450 --> 00:04:31,880
Downtown! Cocorico!

198
00:04:31,880 --> 00:04:33,280
Downtown! Cocorico!

199
00:04:36,450 --> 00:04:39,180
They don't say my name at all

200
00:04:40,080 --> 00:04:42,280
It's just going to end like this

201
00:04:45,510 --> 00:04:46,710
It just ended with the "Woo hoo!"

202
00:04:47,980 --> 00:04:49,980
I wonder if they care at all

203
00:04:53,610 --> 00:04:53,950
Hey!

204
00:04:53,950 --> 00:04:54,950
Hey!

205
00:04:54,950 --> 00:05:01,610
Downtown's Former Manager

206
00:04:54,950 --> 00:05:01,610
Fujiwara Hiroshi

207
00:04:56,310 --> 00:04:57,950
Just for you guys

208
00:04:57,950 --> 00:04:59,550
the local cheerleaders came to support you

209
00:04:59,550 --> 00:05:02,010
the local cheerleaders came to support you

210
00:05:02,180 --> 00:05:04,450
fart

211
00:05:02,450 --> 00:05:03,680
You guys must...

212
00:05:05,850 --> 00:05:07,180
must be feeling pumped up now

213
00:05:07,180 --> 00:05:09,310
Please say something

214
00:05:09,310 --> 00:05:10,980
He farted just now

215
00:05:10,410 --> 00:05:11,380
That's right

216
00:05:10,980 --> 00:05:13,010
Matsumoto

217
00:05:13,010 --> 00:05:14,280
In what way are you pumped up?

218
00:05:14,510 --> 00:05:16,150
Well, you know, it's definitely how

219
00:05:16,150 --> 00:05:17,950
they said "Fight! Fight!" over and over, but

220
00:05:18,110 --> 00:05:19,450
then lead to Hamada's fart...

221
00:05:19,450 --> 00:05:22,350
then lead to Hamada's fart...

222
00:05:22,580 --> 00:05:24,550
The support from the cheerleaders,

223
00:05:24,550 --> 00:05:25,110
due to Hamada's farp

224
00:05:25,110 --> 00:05:28,580
due to Hamada's farp...

225
00:05:28,310 --> 00:05:29,710
He can't speak at all

226
00:05:28,580 --> 00:05:30,410
Your anxiety is ruining it

227
00:05:30,480 --> 00:05:31,350
Farp...

228
00:05:30,980 --> 00:05:33,910
How funny!!

229
00:05:34,180 --> 00:05:35,080
It's funny, right?

230
00:05:34,880 --> 00:05:35,780
How annoying

231
00:05:35,880 --> 00:05:37,310
Matsumoto, isn't your boke super dope?

232
00:05:37,310 --> 00:05:43,510
Matsumoto, isn't your boke super dope?

233
00:05:38,550 --> 00:05:43,510
Matsumoto, isn't your boke super dope?

234
00:05:41,450 --> 00:05:43,050
What the hell

235
00:05:42,180 --> 00:05:43,810
This is getting ridiculous

236
00:05:43,510 --> 00:05:44,180
Every year the quality deteriorates

237
00:05:44,180 --> 00:05:46,780
Every year the quality deteriorates

238
00:05:46,350 --> 00:05:47,650
Yes, you tell him

239
00:05:47,410 --> 00:05:48,210
Enough about that

240
00:05:48,210 --> 00:05:50,980
We're doing it again this year

241
00:05:50,980 --> 00:05:52,110
This year's theme is a prison

242
00:05:52,110 --> 00:05:55,110
This year's theme is a prison

243
00:05:53,880 --> 00:05:55,450
A prison?

244
00:05:53,950 --> 00:05:55,250
A prison?

245
00:05:55,110 --> 00:05:56,680
Prison staff?

246
00:05:56,910 --> 00:05:58,310
Are we the jailers?

247
00:05:58,310 --> 00:05:59,910
For the next 24 hours you guys will be

248
00:05:59,910 --> 00:06:01,380
For the next 24 hours you guys will be

249
00:06:01,380 --> 00:06:05,980
leading the life of a prisoner

250
00:06:03,280 --> 00:06:04,510
What the hell

251
00:06:04,510 --> 00:06:05,950
Why the hell

252
00:06:05,510 --> 00:06:06,710
I thought we'd be the jailers

253
00:06:06,510 --> 00:06:07,610
This ain't right

254
00:06:08,080 --> 00:06:16,410
For 24 Hours they will live as prisoners

255
00:06:08,150 --> 00:06:16,410
All 5 will be imprisoned

256
00:06:08,680 --> 00:06:11,480
This time, all 5 will be imprisoned

257
00:06:11,480 --> 00:06:15,380
And for 24 hours they will live as fictitious prisoners

258
00:06:16,410 --> 00:06:17,980
Why does it have to be like this?  Be prisoners...

259
00:06:17,880 --> 00:06:19,280
No, really?

260
00:06:17,980 --> 00:06:20,710
Why does it have to be like this?  Be prisoners...

261
00:06:20,710 --> 00:06:23,080
I'm saying prison, but

262
00:06:23,080 --> 00:06:24,480
what's with your outfits?

263
00:06:25,110 --> 00:06:26,110
From now

264
00:06:25,680 --> 00:06:27,350
He just keeps going

265
00:06:26,750 --> 00:06:29,780
I'm going to have you guys go get changed

266
00:06:28,150 --> 00:06:29,780
He won't listen to us

267
00:06:29,910 --> 00:06:32,150
Just continues with the lines from his script

268
00:06:31,550 --> 00:06:36,080
It's like what the AIBO says when you get home

269
00:06:32,380 --> 00:06:36,080
Notes: AIBO stands for Artificial Intelligence Robot and was a series of iconic robotic pets.

270
00:06:35,310 --> 00:06:36,850
There's no response

271
00:06:36,410 --> 00:06:37,250
None at all

272
00:06:37,510 --> 00:06:38,650
And he still doesn't say anything

273
00:06:37,950 --> 00:06:39,650
It's all prepared for you

274
00:06:39,650 --> 00:06:40,680
Please get changed

275
00:06:41,580 --> 00:06:49,410
Before becoming a prisoner

276
00:06:41,580 --> 00:06:49,410
they change into appropriate attire

277
00:06:43,580 --> 00:06:44,680
My back hurts

278
00:06:44,610 --> 00:06:46,080
That being the case

279
00:06:46,080 --> 00:06:49,610
They change into prisoner appropriate attire

280
00:06:50,250 --> 00:06:52,410
Are you guys ready?

281
00:06:53,480 --> 00:06:56,710
Then I'll have Matsumoto come out first

282
00:07:00,580 --> 00:07:06,350
Macho Man Prisoner

283
00:07:02,750 --> 00:07:03,950
You're so muscular, you must be strong

284
00:07:03,950 --> 00:07:05,310
You're so muscular, you must be strong

285
00:07:05,480 --> 00:07:07,950
I don't understand why we're being arrested

286
00:07:07,950 --> 00:07:11,550
We shouldn't be able to carry our shackles

287
00:07:11,710 --> 00:07:13,350
Even though I'm told to take this

288
00:07:15,250 --> 00:07:18,110
You're like the Incredible Hulk

289
00:07:17,680 --> 00:07:18,850
Knew he was going to say that

290
00:07:18,110 --> 00:07:19,410
Don't just continue with your lines

291
00:07:20,310 --> 00:07:22,310
Next, Hosei

292
00:07:26,250 --> 00:07:30,610
Babyface Prisoner

293
00:07:26,450 --> 00:07:28,050
You're so small

294
00:07:29,180 --> 00:07:30,710
Really, you're like a rice grain bodhisattva

295
00:07:30,710 --> 00:07:31,480
Really, you're like a rice grain bodhisattva

296
00:07:30,710 --> 00:07:35,350
Note: Jizo bodhisattva are Buddhist deities that protects children. A rice grain bodhisattva is a rice grain that has their likeness drawn onto it as a souvenir or charm.

297
00:07:31,480 --> 00:07:32,950
Really, you're like a rice grain bodhisattva

298
00:07:35,480 --> 00:07:37,580
Next, Endo

299
00:07:40,250 --> 00:07:45,150
Divorced Handsome Prisoner

300
00:07:40,980 --> 00:07:42,780
You're handsome, as always

301
00:07:42,780 --> 00:07:44,150
Thank you

302
00:07:45,010 --> 00:07:45,710
Anyway

303
00:07:46,010 --> 00:07:49,150
Notes: Ryotaro Sugi is a Japanese actor and singer, most famous for period dramas

304
00:07:46,010 --> 00:07:49,150
Ryotaro Sugi  is who you look like

305
00:07:49,310 --> 00:07:50,210
Thank you!

306
00:07:49,980 --> 00:07:51,150
You're not mad?

307
00:07:50,580 --> 00:07:52,950
Next, Tanaka

308
00:07:56,780 --> 00:08:01,710
Lanky Pointy Chin Prisoner

309
00:07:56,910 --> 00:07:58,950
You're lanky, as always

310
00:07:58,950 --> 00:08:00,650
Like Hattifatteners

311
00:07:58,950 --> 00:08:04,580
Notes: Hattifatteners are skinny mushroom-like characters from a Finnish comic called Moomin. In the Japanese version of Moomin, they're called Nyoro Nyoro.

312
00:08:01,080 --> 00:08:02,110
Hattifatteners

313
00:08:01,710 --> 00:08:04,580
From Moomin

314
00:08:04,750 --> 00:08:07,080
Next, Hamada

315
00:08:06,010 --> 00:08:07,280
Wasn't very clear

316
00:08:11,250 --> 00:08:16,280
Only Hamada is a Sexy Female Prisoner

317
00:08:11,750 --> 00:08:12,610
That is no good

318
00:08:12,610 --> 00:08:13,980
That is no good

319
00:08:14,180 --> 00:08:15,980
Give me a break

320
00:08:15,980 --> 00:08:17,980
Could you please stop that?

321
00:08:18,850 --> 00:08:20,150
Just reject them please!!

322
00:08:20,780 --> 00:08:23,010
It's not that, I mean

323
00:08:23,010 --> 00:08:24,910
It's always me!

324
00:08:24,910 --> 00:08:25,450
As soon as I enter, I immediately see this wig

325
00:08:25,450 --> 00:08:28,680
As soon as I enter, I immediately see this wig

326
00:08:28,350 --> 00:08:30,280
Could you resist them a bit?

327
00:08:29,210 --> 00:08:31,480
Is that really a wig?

328
00:08:29,980 --> 00:08:31,750
Why do you wear this?

329
00:08:31,750 --> 00:08:32,780
This is a wig

330
00:08:33,080 --> 00:08:34,880
My head didn't look like this before

331
00:08:33,080 --> 00:08:34,980
You sure you didn't just quickly do your hair?

332
00:08:34,780 --> 00:08:36,250
Quickly do your hair

333
00:08:35,680 --> 00:08:36,980
Just like that

334
00:08:36,650 --> 00:08:37,980
Quickly styling it

335
00:08:37,910 --> 00:08:39,550
I don't think this is a wig

336
00:08:39,780 --> 00:08:40,280
Just comb your hair like this,

337
00:08:40,280 --> 00:08:43,380
Just comb your hair like this,

338
00:08:40,910 --> 00:08:43,380
it'd look like that

339
00:08:43,180 --> 00:08:45,350
There's no way that's a wig

340
00:08:44,180 --> 00:08:45,780
What kind of person is that?

341
00:08:45,780 --> 00:09:00,650
No Laughing Rules

342
00:08:46,680 --> 00:09:00,650
For 24 hours, live as new prisoners

343
00:08:46,780 --> 00:08:48,880
The rules this time are simple

344
00:08:47,050 --> 00:09:00,650
While imprisoned, absolutely no laughing

345
00:08:47,410 --> 00:09:00,650
If you laugh, there is a severe punishment

346
00:08:49,450 --> 00:08:52,250
During the 24 hours while living as prisoners,

347
00:08:52,250 --> 00:08:55,080
no matter what happens, absolutely no laughing

348
00:08:55,650 --> 00:08:58,610
If you laugh, a severe punishment is waiting for you

349
00:08:59,210 --> 00:09:00,650
That is all

350
00:09:01,650 --> 00:09:04,250
A bus bound for the prison is on its way

351
00:09:01,650 --> 00:09:04,250
to get us and take us there!!

352
00:09:06,380 --> 00:09:08,380
I don't get why we've been arrested

353
00:09:08,050 --> 00:09:09,580
I agree

354
00:09:09,050 --> 00:09:09,950
That's right

355
00:09:09,610 --> 00:09:10,810
At the very least

356
00:09:11,410 --> 00:09:12,580
Aren't these shackles heavy?

357
00:09:11,450 --> 00:09:12,810
Really though

358
00:09:13,280 --> 00:09:15,580
Oh, only mine is heavy

359
00:09:15,580 --> 00:09:16,580
You're kidding, right?

360
00:09:18,180 --> 00:09:19,010
Huh?

361
00:09:19,910 --> 00:09:21,150
It is kinda heavy

362
00:09:20,580 --> 00:09:24,580
Only Hosei's shackle weighs 10kg (about 22lb)

363
00:09:22,110 --> 00:09:23,510
Are you serious?

364
00:09:22,810 --> 00:09:24,010
I'm serious

365
00:09:28,750 --> 00:09:30,010
It's true!!

366
00:09:30,010 --> 00:09:32,450
It's true!!

367
00:09:30,050 --> 00:09:32,010
This is just plain mean

368
00:09:32,010 --> 00:09:33,450
It actually is heavy?

369
00:09:33,210 --> 00:09:35,880
About 5 times heavier

370
00:09:34,880 --> 00:09:35,810
Right right

371
00:09:36,150 --> 00:09:40,780
Time to start

372
00:09:37,250 --> 00:09:38,980
At last

373
00:09:38,980 --> 00:09:41,150
it is time to start

374
00:09:41,350 --> 00:09:45,350
Rising Tension

375
00:09:42,310 --> 00:09:44,710
The tension rises naturally

376
00:09:45,610 --> 00:09:46,710
Well now

377
00:09:47,580 --> 00:09:48,950
This is so annoying

378
00:09:48,210 --> 00:09:50,580
In this case, a police van is what we need

379
00:09:50,580 --> 00:09:52,350
In this case, a police van is what we need

380
00:09:52,350 --> 00:09:55,780
Why a bus?!

381
00:09:56,250 --> 00:09:58,080
Here it is

382
00:09:58,310 --> 00:09:59,380
The bus is here like no big deal

383
00:09:59,380 --> 00:10:00,180
As if it's no big deal.

384
00:10:01,510 --> 00:10:04,210
It must have not been a major crime, so can we just not do this whole thing?

385
00:10:04,380 --> 00:10:06,680
There’s no need for chains, right?

386
00:10:07,010 --> 00:10:09,080
Kurobikari Central...

387
00:10:09,080 --> 00:10:10,680
Here it is.

388
00:10:10,680 --> 00:10:13,150
Gaasuu Kurobikari Central Prison

389
00:10:13,150 --> 00:10:15,150
This is the name of the prison you'll all be going to.

390
00:10:17,280 --> 00:10:23,580
Gaasuu Kurobikari Central Prison

391
00:10:25,950 --> 00:10:28,080
The bus is painted in yellow and black

392
00:10:28,080 --> 00:10:30,880
to signify danger.

393
00:10:31,310 --> 00:10:34,310
The destination is the central prison.

394
00:10:34,810 --> 00:10:37,980
The No Laughing starts once you board the bus.

395
00:10:37,980 --> 00:10:39,550
So once we board, it starts.

396
00:10:39,550 --> 00:10:42,150
I gotta first get used to how Hamada looks.

397
00:10:42,150 --> 00:10:44,150
That's true.

398
00:10:44,150 --> 00:10:46,710
You can’t get used to that.

399
00:10:48,710 --> 00:10:52,010
Okay, Hamada, please board first.

400
00:10:52,010 --> 00:10:53,680
Please, thank you.  It’s gonna start.

401
00:10:53,680 --> 00:10:55,250
It's cold out.

402
00:10:57,250 --> 00:10:59,710
Close the doors.

403
00:11:00,950 --> 00:11:04,150
He's laughing already.

404
00:11:04,810 --> 00:11:07,210
He's already on board.

405
00:11:05,810 --> 00:11:08,210
What?  I'm not on board yet.

406
00:11:07,410 --> 00:11:08,710
You just laughed.

407
00:11:08,710 --> 00:11:09,910
I'm not at the top!

408
00:11:16,410 --> 00:11:18,410
This is the worst.

409
00:11:18,410 --> 00:11:19,610
Hit him on the butt.

410
00:11:21,680 --> 00:11:25,150
The Black Army Gang Smacks Your Butt

411
00:11:23,380 --> 00:11:24,380
You can go stronger.

412
00:11:24,380 --> 00:11:26,110
Practice, go practice.

413
00:11:27,910 --> 00:11:28,980
Should we go then?

414
00:11:28,980 --> 00:11:30,280
Here I go.

415
00:11:30,280 --> 00:11:32,550
They should have seriously closed the doors and left us.

416
00:11:34,380 --> 00:11:36,380
Okay.

417
00:11:37,210 --> 00:11:40,750
Regular passengers are already on board

418
00:11:38,850 --> 00:11:40,750
It’s warmer than necessary in here.

419
00:11:41,750 --> 00:11:45,750
The bus finally departs for the central prison.

420
00:11:45,980 --> 00:11:48,750
What lies in wait for them?

421
00:11:49,410 --> 00:11:57,750
Laughing is not allowed.

422
00:11:50,310 --> 00:11:52,750
Laughing is no longer allowed.

423
00:11:53,910 --> 00:11:56,750
The mood in the bus is uneasy.

424
00:11:57,750 --> 00:11:58,950
However,

425
00:11:58,910 --> 00:12:04,110
the assassins of laughter will not go easy. Their assaults will be merciless!!

426
00:12:05,610 --> 00:12:07,110
Please be careful about that.

427
00:12:07,450 --> 00:12:13,880
The bus arrives at a stop

428
00:12:10,280 --> 00:12:12,280
Isn’t this really fast?

429
00:12:14,150 --> 00:12:15,210
That was fast.

430
00:12:15,410 --> 00:12:17,410
Matsuko, are you going to be all right?

431
00:12:17,410 --> 00:12:21,150
Matsuko Deluxe

432
00:12:17,410 --> 00:12:21,150
Tarento

433
00:12:22,150 --> 00:12:23,150
This is fast.

434
00:12:23,150 --> 00:12:25,150
What's the matter?

435
00:12:24,350 --> 00:12:26,250
This is definitely fast.

436
00:12:26,210 --> 00:12:30,080
Director

437
00:12:26,210 --> 00:12:30,080
Hakata Daikichi

438
00:12:26,380 --> 00:12:28,480
This, you see,

439
00:12:28,480 --> 00:12:30,680
is a new show by our company, Saitama Hatsuratsu TV

440
00:12:30,680 --> 00:12:32,680
which has staked its future on this show.

441
00:12:32,510 --> 00:12:37,910
In the middle of an on-location shoot for a new show

442
00:12:32,680 --> 00:12:34,780
This is the first on-location shoot.

443
00:12:35,050 --> 00:12:37,910
Whatever. Didn’t I do everything fine?

444
00:12:37,910 --> 00:12:41,380
Another person will be coming, but I'll say this again.  Please do this right.

445
00:12:41,910 --> 00:12:44,210
Another person?

446
00:12:44,210 --> 00:12:47,850
Not that way.  This way, this bus!!

447
00:12:55,450 --> 00:12:57,950
Not that way.  This way, this bus!!

448
00:13:01,830 --> 00:13:04,800
Composer

449
00:13:01,830 --> 00:13:04,800
Niigaki Takashi*

450
00:13:01,830 --> 00:13:08,830
*Note: In February 2014, Niigaki Takashi revealed himself to be the ghostwriter for Samuragochi Mamoru.  The latter had claimed to be a deaf and physically disabled composer.  The revelation by Niigaki that Samuragochi had faked the authenticity of his compositions and physical disabilities was a huge news story in Japan in 2014.

451
00:13:02,630 --> 00:13:03,730
You're kidding.

452
00:13:07,510 --> 00:13:10,110
Let’s not use the casting.

453
00:13:10,110 --> 00:13:12,350
Let’s not make us laugh because of casting.

454
00:13:12,350 --> 00:13:14,310
It's a phenomenon, so it can't be helped, but...

455
00:13:20,950 --> 00:13:23,150
The casting...

456
00:13:23,150 --> 00:13:25,280
As if this was some normal thing.

457
00:13:25,810 --> 00:13:28,010
Mr. Niigaki,

458
00:13:28,010 --> 00:13:30,410
Matsuko and Niigaki's Local Bus Journey.

459
00:13:30,410 --> 00:13:34,010
This is a show where this year's most famous gay person and composer

460
00:13:34,010 --> 00:13:36,280
take a journey using only the local bus.

461
00:13:36,110 --> 00:13:42,010
*Note: This is referring to a real TV show where two TV personalities (Tagawa Yosuke and Ebisu Yoshikazu) go on a local bus journey, "ローカル路線バス乗り継ぎの旅 (Local Bus Transit Journey)".

462
00:13:36,110 --> 00:13:42,010
A segment that resembles a popular TV show*

463
00:13:37,110 --> 00:13:42,010
Isn’t this a rip-off of that one on TV Tokyo by Tagawa and Ebisu?

464
00:13:42,480 --> 00:13:43,980
This is bad, right, Mr. Niigaki?

465
00:13:45,180 --> 00:13:46,850
Yes.

466
00:13:46,850 --> 00:13:50,850
I think it is bad to use someone else's work.

467
00:13:56,850 --> 00:13:58,850
What is that, seriously?

468
00:13:59,050 --> 00:14:01,050
What is that?

469
00:14:03,350 --> 00:14:06,280
The setup is just too solid.

470
00:14:07,280 --> 00:14:09,850
It's fine.  But this is TV

471
00:14:09,850 --> 00:14:13,380
so we want to capture a certain amount of incidents.

472
00:14:13,380 --> 00:14:17,380
How are we suppose to cause incidents?

473
00:14:13,380 --> 00:14:17,750
He wants to capture incidents during the journey

474
00:14:17,380 --> 00:14:21,980
I was thinking, perhaps, you two could create them.

475
00:14:21,950 --> 00:14:23,150
How are we suppose to cause incidents?

476
00:14:22,380 --> 00:14:29,210
Deliberately create an incident

477
00:14:23,110 --> 00:14:25,310
We've prepared a number of things,

478
00:14:25,310 --> 00:14:27,310
so could we just rehearse them?

479
00:14:28,310 --> 00:14:29,580
Okay.

480
00:14:29,580 --> 00:14:33,210
First off, how about this?

481
00:14:32,580 --> 00:14:34,180
What is that?

482
00:14:34,180 --> 00:14:35,380
It's an electric muscle stimulator.

483
00:14:35,550 --> 00:14:44,210
Electric Muscle Stimulator

484
00:14:35,550 --> 00:14:44,210
Incident Item 1

485
00:14:37,410 --> 00:14:41,610
We’ll have you put this on your face and introduce the scene.

486
00:14:41,650 --> 00:14:44,210
With this electric stimulation, our ratings will also rise electrically.

487
00:14:44,210 --> 00:14:46,510
There's no way it’ll go that easily.

488
00:14:46,510 --> 00:14:47,180
What do you think, sir?

489
00:14:48,210 --> 00:14:49,180
I think it will go well.

490
00:14:51,180 --> 00:14:53,310
Okay, Matsuko.

491
00:14:59,310 --> 00:15:02,750
Mr. Niigaki will operate the electric muscle stimulator.

492
00:15:06,080 --> 00:15:12,810
This time we have come to Tochigi Prefecture, where places like Nikko Tosho-gu, Mt. Nikko, and Rinno-ji are located.

493
00:15:06,080 --> 00:15:21,310
Voltage Meter

494
00:15:12,810 --> 00:15:18,610
One can enjoy the historic environment and be in the presence of numerous historic sites.

495
00:15:23,350 --> 00:15:26,650
It’s too high.

496
00:15:28,350 --> 00:15:30,080
It's set on 9.

497
00:15:34,550 --> 00:15:36,180
That’s a bit strong.

498
00:15:38,550 --> 00:15:40,550
Was that okay?

499
00:15:41,380 --> 00:15:52,350
Voltage Meter

500
00:15:41,550 --> 00:15:45,950
With sites like Kegon Waterfall, which has a height of 97 meters,

501
00:15:45,950 --> 00:15:48,550
the region is full of tourist attractions.

502
00:15:56,350 --> 00:15:58,280
It's on 9 again.

503
00:15:58,310 --> 00:16:01,810
Sir, could you please lower it?

504
00:16:01,710 --> 00:16:03,210
Can't we just get one smack for all of this?

505
00:16:05,210 --> 00:16:06,850
Alright, already.

506
00:16:07,250 --> 00:16:10,550
Can we be done with this part?  Was that fine?

507
00:16:08,850 --> 00:16:11,410
That was a pretty nice incident.

508
00:16:11,410 --> 00:16:13,810
Then, are we about done?

509
00:16:13,810 --> 00:16:17,550
We still have more, though.

510
00:16:14,910 --> 00:16:16,410
More?

511
00:16:16,550 --> 00:16:20,380
More incidents are desired

512
00:16:18,510 --> 00:16:20,180
Here we go.

513
00:16:21,380 --> 00:16:22,810
What is that?

514
00:16:22,980 --> 00:16:24,680
A giant balloon kit.

515
00:16:24,680 --> 00:16:30,310
Giant Balloon Kit

516
00:16:24,680 --> 00:16:30,310
Incident Item 2

517
00:16:25,380 --> 00:16:28,680
We’ll put this inside your clothes and expand the balloon

518
00:16:28,680 --> 00:16:30,280
while you read the tourism information from before.

519
00:16:30,810 --> 00:16:33,210
Have Mr. Niigaki do it as well.

520
00:16:33,210 --> 00:16:33,280
Instead of using the tarento, they go for something more novel

521
00:16:33,210 --> 00:16:34,810
Not just me.

522
00:16:35,410 --> 00:16:37,210
Can you, sir?

523
00:16:38,980 --> 00:16:39,780
I'll do it.

524
00:16:41,280 --> 00:16:45,080
We would be grateful if you could do this for us.

525
00:16:45,080 --> 00:16:46,750
Put it on like this?

526
00:16:46,750 --> 00:16:48,780
Put it inside the clothes.

527
00:16:50,550 --> 00:16:53,150
Thank you.  Is that ok?

528
00:16:53,150 --> 00:16:55,880
Okay, let’s rehearse it.

529
00:16:57,750 --> 00:17:00,150
This time we have come to

530
00:16:59,880 --> 00:17:42,750
Balloon Expanding

531
00:17:00,780 --> 00:17:03,850
Tochigi Prefecture

532
00:17:03,850 --> 00:17:06,650
where places like Nikko Tosho-gu, Mt. Nikko,

533
00:17:06,650 --> 00:17:08,150
and Rinno-ji are located.

534
00:17:09,150 --> 00:17:11,150
The sites within Mt. Nikko

535
00:17:11,150 --> 00:17:13,150
are listed as

536
00:17:13,150 --> 00:17:14,650
a UNESCO World Heritage Site

537
00:17:15,680 --> 00:17:17,150
and one can enjoy

538
00:17:17,150 --> 00:17:21,150
the historic environment

539
00:17:21,150 --> 00:17:24,580
and be in the presence of numerous historic sites.

540
00:17:23,950 --> 00:17:27,450
And currently

541
00:17:26,810 --> 00:17:27,910
Sir, please raise your voice.

542
00:17:30,080 --> 00:17:31,780
Is this really safe!?

543
00:17:31,780 --> 00:17:33,080
It should be safe!!

544
00:17:33,580 --> 00:17:36,080
It's supposed to get this big!?

545
00:17:41,080 --> 00:17:42,680
It's crazy when you're right next to it.

546
00:17:58,480 --> 00:17:59,710
Absolutely nothing.

547
00:17:59,580 --> 00:18:02,050
He gave absolutely no reaction.

548
00:18:04,410 --> 00:18:06,580
That was a novel sight.

549
00:18:08,480 --> 00:18:11,380
He was so startled he didn’t even give a reaction.

550
00:18:11,380 --> 00:18:13,380
Sir, that was good.

551
00:18:13,380 --> 00:18:14,680
Sir, that was wonderful.

552
00:18:14,680 --> 00:18:15,780
Really.

553
00:18:16,010 --> 00:18:18,510
Assistant!  Bring that over.  Bring that in.

554
00:18:18,510 --> 00:18:23,510
Going with the flow, another thing is added

555
00:18:26,380 --> 00:18:27,880
What is that?

556
00:18:27,880 --> 00:18:28,880
That's the Chinko Machine.

557
00:18:29,680 --> 00:18:39,110
Chinko Machine

558
00:18:29,680 --> 00:18:39,110
Incident Item 3

559
00:18:30,180 --> 00:18:31,680
I just stand here?

560
00:18:31,110 --> 00:18:32,680
You just need to stand there.

561
00:18:39,410 --> 00:18:40,780
Is the cue card fine?

562
00:18:40,780 --> 00:18:42,680
Yes, it's fine.

563
00:18:44,110 --> 00:18:46,080
What exactly is the situation with Matsuko there?

564
00:18:50,580 --> 00:18:52,780
It’s the first time to see Matsuko like that, right?

565
00:18:53,480 --> 00:18:56,080
She looks so weird.

566
00:18:56,080 --> 00:18:58,250
Pisses me off.

567
00:18:58,250 --> 00:19:00,450
Just wear that from the beginning, then.

568
00:19:02,450 --> 00:19:06,250
That hit Matsuko.

569
00:19:06,250 --> 00:19:13,380
Chinko Machine

570
00:19:06,250 --> 00:19:13,380
The machine fires at some point during the take

571
00:19:08,050 --> 00:19:09,250
Okay, Matsuko.

572
00:19:09,250 --> 00:19:10,850
She's sort of like Oba-Q, right?*

573
00:19:09,250 --> 00:19:14,250
*Note: "Oba-Q" or "Obake No Q-taro" is a manga featuring a character that is a large, round ghost.

574
00:19:11,250 --> 00:19:12,750
You're right, that's like Oba-Q.

575
00:19:12,750 --> 00:19:13,980
It's sort of like Oba-Q.

576
00:19:13,980 --> 00:19:16,380
This time we have come to

577
00:19:16,380 --> 00:19:20,980
Tochigi Prefecture, where places like Nikko Tosho-gu, Mt. Nikko, and Rinno-ji are located.

578
00:19:20,980 --> 00:19:24,050
The Yamaage Festival is a well-known tourist attraction

579
00:19:24,050 --> 00:19:26,780
as well as local cuisine like shimotsukare, and surely you know about

580
00:19:26,910 --> 00:19:28,710
No!!

581
00:19:29,810 --> 00:19:31,610
No!!

582
00:19:38,910 --> 00:19:40,010
She went “No!”

583
00:19:40,310 --> 00:19:42,150
She went “No!”

584
00:19:48,810 --> 00:19:51,950
What is this?

585
00:19:51,950 --> 00:19:54,250
That was great, Matsuko.

586
00:19:54,250 --> 00:19:55,850
What was great about that?  Seriously?

587
00:19:55,850 --> 00:19:57,210
I think the viewers will love it.

588
00:19:57,150 --> 00:19:59,150
Now that it has come to this, sir,

589
00:19:59,150 --> 00:20:00,850
you can't take a backseat to this, right?

590
00:20:01,680 --> 00:20:02,780
We have one more thing.

591
00:20:02,780 --> 00:20:05,250
Let's try this one.

592
00:20:05,250 --> 00:20:11,850
Incident item 4
Hirata Stag Beetle

593
00:20:08,280 --> 00:20:11,450
You use this stag beetle and clip it on your nose.

594
00:20:08,750 --> 00:20:11,850
Sensei...

595
00:20:09,450 --> 00:20:11,450
We’ll have your nose get pinched by the stag beetle.

596
00:20:12,150 --> 00:20:13,850
Let's do this.

597
00:20:22,050 --> 00:20:27,180
The place that we've arrived today is a secret location that is rarely known...

598
00:20:24,450 --> 00:20:30,080
Sensei is giving no reaction while enduring severe pain

599
00:20:36,750 --> 00:20:37,850
This will hurt.

600
00:20:37,850 --> 00:20:38,980
That was amazing.

601
00:20:44,250 --> 00:20:45,680
Sensei, can you do it again?

602
00:20:45,780 --> 00:20:46,680
Do it again?

603
00:20:52,450 --> 00:20:54,450
Sensei, you don't have to.

604
00:20:54,450 --> 00:20:56,280
Sensei, that's enough!

605
00:20:56,750 --> 00:20:59,350
It's alright, you don't have to do it.

606
00:21:00,750 --> 00:21:02,180
That hurts!

607
00:21:01,550 --> 00:21:04,380
It hurts that much, huh?

608
00:21:04,050 --> 00:21:05,550
It's alright, don't do it.

609
00:21:05,250 --> 00:21:07,750
There is no reaction from him at all.

610
00:21:12,550 --> 00:21:14,150
Should we go?

611
00:21:14,250 --> 00:21:15,380
Let's get out.

612
00:21:15,880 --> 00:21:17,250
Ah, so you're doing it.

613
00:21:20,750 --> 00:21:21,980
Ah, there it is.

614
00:21:22,750 --> 00:21:25,050
That hurts really bad...

615
00:21:26,250 --> 00:21:28,450
It's been 20 minutes since we started.

616
00:21:28,750 --> 00:21:35,110
The storms of punishment are not stopping.

617
00:21:33,710 --> 00:21:35,450
So we only started for 20 minutes?

618
00:21:35,380 --> 00:21:42,410
There will be even more stronger assassins waiting for them.

619
00:21:43,310 --> 00:21:45,280
We stopped at a strange place.

620
00:21:48,080 --> 00:21:52,680
Arrived at a bus stop

621
00:21:48,080 --> 00:21:52,680
Arrived at a bus stop

622
00:21:59,450 --> 00:22:04,710
Double Cheesecake
Himura Yuki

623
00:21:59,450 --> 00:22:04,710
Double Cheesecake
Himura Yuki

624
00:21:59,450 --> 00:22:04,710
Double Cheesecake
Tsuchiya Anna

625
00:21:59,450 --> 00:22:04,710
Double Cheesecake
Tsuchiya Anna

626
00:21:59,580 --> 00:22:00,880
Uwah, that was bad.

627
00:22:01,210 --> 00:22:02,180
We didn't pass.

628
00:22:02,180 --> 00:22:03,510
No, we didn't.

629
00:22:04,750 --> 00:22:09,380
This time was no good, huh?

630
00:22:06,250 --> 00:22:09,180
I wonder why

631
00:22:09,050 --> 00:22:15,080
An unsuccessful comedian duo

632
00:22:09,180 --> 00:22:11,050
It must be that judge.

633
00:22:11,050 --> 00:22:13,480
I wonder why. I guess they don't have any sense.

634
00:22:12,850 --> 00:22:15,280
That's right! It must be that.

635
00:22:13,580 --> 00:22:15,280
I know right? That must be it!

636
00:22:15,480 --> 00:22:16,950
Should we show them our joke?

637
00:22:17,350 --> 00:22:18,780
To someone here.
Okay ♥

638
00:22:18,850 --> 00:22:20,480
Should we show them?

639
00:22:19,480 --> 00:22:20,250
Yeah~

640
00:22:21,480 --> 00:22:23,750
Ah!?

641
00:22:22,380 --> 00:22:23,480
Ah!

642
00:22:25,580 --> 00:22:28,350
We met last year, right?

643
00:22:28,610 --> 00:22:30,250
Do you remember us?

644
00:22:31,310 --> 00:22:32,310
That's right!

645
00:22:32,310 --> 00:22:34,110
We want to show someone our joke...

646
00:22:34,550 --> 00:22:36,310
Well, I...

647
00:22:36,650 --> 00:22:38,910
I want to show our joke...

648
00:22:38,910 --> 00:22:41,010
WHY ARE YOU LAUGHING!?!

649
00:22:44,450 --> 00:22:46,250
She's just doing as she likes.

650
00:22:45,610 --> 00:22:47,850
You shouldn't laugh this soon.

651
00:22:46,980 --> 00:22:53,350
Reason for being unsuccessful (1)

652
00:22:46,980 --> 00:22:53,350
Tsuchiya is acting too freely

653
00:22:48,210 --> 00:22:49,610
That's scary.

654
00:22:49,610 --> 00:22:51,310
She's being too free.

655
00:22:51,150 --> 00:22:53,350
I won't laugh.

656
00:22:54,310 --> 00:22:56,680
That's right. Don't laugh.

657
00:22:56,680 --> 00:22:59,280
Just hold it together.

658
00:22:58,680 --> 00:23:02,680
We want to show you our sketch after a year.

659
00:23:02,680 --> 00:23:06,110
Do you want to watch our growth the past year?

660
00:23:06,210 --> 00:23:07,410
That's fine.

661
00:23:07,110 --> 00:23:08,510
Really? Yay!

662
00:23:08,610 --> 00:23:10,180
Thank you so much!

663
00:23:10,180 --> 00:23:11,710
Alright!

664
00:23:12,910 --> 00:23:16,750
Double Cheesecake presents a short sketch.

665
00:23:16,750 --> 00:23:17,850
New Year's Day!!

666
00:23:18,010 --> 00:23:57,210
Sketch "New Year's Day"

667
00:23:18,450 --> 00:23:21,550
Alright, here you go.

668
00:23:20,950 --> 00:23:21,550
Okay.

669
00:23:21,550 --> 00:23:23,110
Are you ready? Let's go.

670
00:23:23,310 --> 00:23:24,810
Have fun.

671
00:23:24,310 --> 00:23:25,210
I'm ready.

672
00:23:25,010 --> 00:23:26,010
Let's go!

673
00:23:25,510 --> 00:23:26,210
Okay.

674
00:23:26,750 --> 00:23:27,710
Oh yeah...

675
00:23:28,450 --> 00:23:29,310
Before this...

676
00:23:29,980 --> 00:23:35,450
There was a man who wanted to look cool so he put on color contacts.

677
00:23:36,050 --> 00:23:39,550
WHAAAAATTT!????

678
00:23:40,380 --> 00:23:41,950
SO HE REALLY DID, HUH!?

679
00:23:42,550 --> 00:23:43,950
A man is in silence!

680
00:23:45,250 --> 00:23:45,980
The naked eye.

681
00:23:45,980 --> 00:23:47,650
A man is in silence!

682
00:23:47,880 --> 00:23:48,980
The naked eye.

683
00:23:49,550 --> 00:23:51,850
That's another person's joke!!

684
00:23:51,850 --> 00:23:53,050
We're not rare.

685
00:23:52,750 --> 00:23:54,050
We're not baked.

686
00:23:53,710 --> 00:23:55,750
That's right, we're double cheesecake.

687
00:24:01,050 --> 00:24:02,610
It feels like we did it.

688
00:24:02,810 --> 00:24:04,250
No way...

689
00:24:03,310 --> 00:24:08,510
Reason for being unsuccessful (2)

690
00:24:03,310 --> 00:24:08,510
They copy other people's jokes

691
00:24:07,610 --> 00:24:08,850
You didn't do it at all...

692
00:24:08,810 --> 00:24:10,510
What do you think?

693
00:24:10,810 --> 00:24:12,710
We really leveled up, right?

694
00:24:12,580 --> 00:24:13,510
Right?

695
00:24:13,480 --> 00:24:15,880
Hi there, double cheesecake!

696
00:24:17,550 --> 00:24:18,780
Ah, what is that?

697
00:24:18,580 --> 00:24:20,050
Well, we...

698
00:24:25,080 --> 00:24:27,150
You can't laugh, earlier I started laughing as well.

699
00:24:27,880 --> 00:24:29,880
This is an amazing world.

700
00:24:32,080 --> 00:24:33,950
That hurts!

701
00:24:34,710 --> 00:24:35,910
Kechaa!!

702
00:24:35,910 --> 00:24:38,510
We just got back from an audition too.

703
00:24:38,210 --> 00:24:39,250
Really? How was it?

704
00:24:39,080 --> 00:24:43,580
Comedian
Rola

705
00:24:39,080 --> 00:24:43,580
Comedian
Rola

706
00:24:39,080 --> 00:24:43,580
Comedian

Comedian
Wakabayashi Masayasu

708
00:24:39,480 --> 00:24:43,710
Well, it was a bit..

709
00:24:43,580 --> 00:24:48,550
Another unsuccessful comedian duo

710
00:24:43,610 --> 00:24:45,480
It didn't go well?

711
00:24:44,380 --> 00:24:45,480
Yeah...

712
00:24:46,380 --> 00:24:47,880
Why don't you show them your joke?

713
00:24:48,010 --> 00:24:48,610
Eh?

714
00:24:48,410 --> 00:24:50,580
These are our friends...

715
00:24:50,680 --> 00:24:52,280
They're really funny!

716
00:24:52,410 --> 00:24:53,410
We are.

717
00:24:53,410 --> 00:24:55,410
Just show them. Go!

718
00:24:53,780 --> 00:24:55,010
Shall we?

719
00:24:55,480 --> 00:24:56,410
Good luck!

720
00:24:57,450 --> 00:24:58,750
A short sketch.

721
00:24:58,550 --> 00:24:59,850
"A funny story".

722
00:24:59,950 --> 00:25:53,650
Sketch "A funny story"

723
00:25:00,350 --> 00:25:03,010
Today, I have a really funny story to tell!

724
00:25:02,650 --> 00:25:04,150
What kind of story?

725
00:25:04,410 --> 00:25:06,510
I was walking down the street the other day...

726
00:25:06,510 --> 00:25:08,650
And um...

727
00:25:08,650 --> 00:25:10,650
You were walking down the street...

728
00:25:10,650 --> 00:25:12,510
Um...
Are you okay?

729
00:25:13,110 --> 00:25:14,950
What was it again...

730
00:25:14,050 --> 00:25:17,710
Rola-chan, can it be that you forgot your story?

731
00:25:17,850 --> 00:25:20,710
Ah! Oh no! I forgot!

732
00:25:21,050 --> 00:25:22,910
Heetakoitaa!!

733
00:25:24,250 --> 00:25:26,450
Heetakoitaa?

734
00:25:27,610 --> 00:25:29,550
She doesn't even know the original joke!

735
00:25:35,510 --> 00:25:37,010
I forgot it~!

736
00:25:37,010 --> 00:25:39,050
But that doesn't matter!

737
00:25:44,110 --> 00:25:46,850
Rola-chan, that's another person's joke.

738
00:25:46,610 --> 00:25:47,950
Ehehehehe

739
00:25:46,610 --> 00:25:47,950
Ehehehehe

740
00:25:46,610 --> 00:25:47,950
Ehehehehe

741
00:25:46,610 --> 00:25:47,950
Ehehehehe

742
00:25:46,610 --> 00:25:47,950
Ehehehehe

743
00:25:48,150 --> 00:25:49,510
We have a hole.

744
00:25:49,210 --> 00:25:50,410
But we're not chikuwa.

745
00:25:50,410 --> 00:25:52,010
We're The Baumkuchen.

746
00:25:50,410 --> 00:25:52,010
We're The Baumkuchen.

747
00:25:58,410 --> 00:25:59,910
That wasn't good at all.

748
00:25:59,110 --> 00:26:03,950
Reason for being unsuccessful (3)
Obviously copying other people's joke

749
00:26:03,880 --> 00:26:05,980
That hurts!

750
00:26:05,810 --> 00:26:07,780
I'm glad we showed them our joke.

751
00:26:07,080 --> 00:26:08,610
That was great, right?

752
00:26:07,880 --> 00:26:10,180
Your joke quality is higher.

753
00:26:10,580 --> 00:26:12,180
Excuse me...

754
00:26:12,180 --> 00:26:15,510
Can you see some joke from one of us?

755
00:26:15,510 --> 00:26:18,780
It's something that's not a sketch, can you watch that?

756
00:26:18,780 --> 00:26:19,980
Yeah, go ahead.

757
00:26:19,980 --> 00:26:22,180
Really, then show them.

758
00:26:21,680 --> 00:26:26,510
Well, our Rola is really good at making sentences with syllables.

759
00:26:26,410 --> 00:26:32,580
The Baumkuchen's strength:
Good with compositions

760
00:26:27,050 --> 00:26:29,950
She can really sum up the sentences quite well.

761
00:26:29,950 --> 00:26:32,810
Can we show it to you?

762
00:26:32,950 --> 00:26:38,210
Why don't we start with the word Ha.Ma.Da.Ma.Sa.To.Shi?

763
00:26:36,810 --> 00:26:40,450
Hamada Masatoshi

764
00:26:36,810 --> 00:26:40,450
Topic

765
00:26:38,650 --> 00:26:40,050
Is it alright?
Yes.

766
00:26:40,110 --> 00:26:41,710
Let's start with the first syllable from Hamada Masatoshi.

767
00:26:41,710 --> 00:26:45,850
Ha

768
00:26:43,080 --> 00:26:45,850
Violent retorts

769
00:26:46,080 --> 00:26:49,950
Ma

770
00:26:48,450 --> 00:26:49,950
In a flash

771
00:26:50,180 --> 00:26:52,750
Da

772
00:26:50,550 --> 00:26:52,750
Without fail, the important stuff

773
00:26:53,010 --> 00:26:55,580
Ma

774
00:26:54,180 --> 00:26:55,580
Earnestly

775
00:26:55,850 --> 00:26:58,650
Sa

776
00:26:57,150 --> 00:26:58,650
As expected

777
00:26:58,910 --> 00:27:01,310
To

778
00:26:59,580 --> 00:27:01,310
He puts in the effort

779
00:27:01,580 --> 00:27:08,110
Shi

780
00:27:02,180 --> 00:27:08,110
Unbelievably has a Gorilla's face

781
00:27:11,780 --> 00:27:13,380
You didn't even connect the sentence.

782
00:27:13,380 --> 00:27:15,980
That was not related at all.

783
00:27:14,580 --> 00:27:16,680
No continuation at all.

784
00:27:16,450 --> 00:27:19,750
Rola is harsh

785
00:27:20,580 --> 00:27:22,380
No matter what we said, you already know what you'll be saying!

786
00:27:21,880 --> 00:27:23,250
That must be it!

787
00:27:23,280 --> 00:27:24,680
You already decided earlier to say it.

788
00:27:24,980 --> 00:27:26,750
Shall we show them another one?

789
00:27:26,750 --> 00:27:31,650
Our Rola has a lot of secret stories about celebrities.

790
00:27:31,410 --> 00:27:41,850
The Baumkuchen's strength:
She can expose a lot of stories of any celebrities

791
00:27:31,650 --> 00:27:37,750
She has lots of them. If you say a celeb's name, she can expose something about them.

792
00:27:38,010 --> 00:27:42,210
Shall we do it? Who wants to start?

793
00:27:41,910 --> 00:27:43,010
Go ahead.

794
00:27:43,850 --> 00:27:45,450
Antonio Inoki-san.

795
00:27:45,010 --> 00:27:46,010
Ah, Inoki!

796
00:27:46,010 --> 00:27:47,450
I know him.

797
00:27:48,510 --> 00:27:50,350
"You bastard!!" That person right?

798
00:27:50,850 --> 00:27:54,550
That person used to exist in the past.

799
00:28:03,510 --> 00:28:05,410
What was that?

800
00:28:05,010 --> 00:28:08,550
Is that so? That's amazing!

801
00:28:08,410 --> 00:28:11,010
You can't even call that an exposure.

802
00:28:11,150 --> 00:28:12,950
You really know a lot, Rola-chan.

803
00:28:11,750 --> 00:28:15,250
Double cheesecake's strength:
Performing an amazing skill with the help of an item

804
00:28:12,950 --> 00:28:15,050
Let's go and show them.

805
00:28:14,550 --> 00:28:15,610
Yes!

806
00:28:15,410 --> 00:28:17,650
With her butt...

807
00:28:16,910 --> 00:28:17,910
Gimme a sec.

808
00:28:17,980 --> 00:28:19,910
She'll break a chopstick with her butt.

809
00:28:19,180 --> 00:28:25,110
Double cheesecake's strength:
She's break a chopstick in half using the power of her butt

810
00:28:21,910 --> 00:28:24,610
Okay, I'm ready. Put it seriously lower.

811
00:28:25,180 --> 00:28:26,380
Lower.

812
00:28:25,850 --> 00:28:27,550
What is she saying "Put it seriously lower"?

813
00:28:27,150 --> 00:28:28,580
Lower, lower.

814
00:28:28,280 --> 00:28:29,850
Around here?

815
00:28:29,250 --> 00:28:30,150
Lower.

816
00:28:30,850 --> 00:28:31,750
Around here is okay?

817
00:28:31,650 --> 00:28:32,350
Yeah!

818
00:28:32,150 --> 00:28:33,980
Okay, now let's do this!

819
00:28:33,980 --> 00:28:38,050
Will it break? 3, 2, 1...

820
00:28:42,350 --> 00:28:44,050
Yeah, it broke!!

821
00:28:46,380 --> 00:28:48,180
What the hell was that.

822
00:28:47,550 --> 00:28:48,750
I broke it.

823
00:28:48,250 --> 00:28:49,550
That was awesome!

824
00:28:50,350 --> 00:28:51,650
So cool!!

825
00:28:52,050 --> 00:28:53,750
That wasn't cool at all...

826
00:28:53,950 --> 00:28:55,050
Look, look.

827
00:28:56,650 --> 00:28:57,850
Well, that was great, right?

828
00:28:58,150 --> 00:28:59,050
It was great!

829
00:28:58,180 --> 00:28:59,650
I gained confidence.

830
00:28:59,050 --> 00:29:01,250
Thank you so much; sorry for taking up your time.

831
00:29:00,580 --> 00:29:01,850
Thank you so much.

832
00:29:01,250 --> 00:29:02,450
Really, thank you.

833
00:29:02,580 --> 00:29:04,650
We gained confidence as girls as well.

834
00:29:03,850 --> 00:29:05,580
We really did it properly, right?

835
00:29:05,250 --> 00:29:06,550
Goodbye!

836
00:29:07,050 --> 00:29:08,350
Do your best!

837
00:29:09,150 --> 00:29:10,250
It actually broke.

838
00:29:09,850 --> 00:29:11,350
Yeah, it did.

839
00:29:13,450 --> 00:29:16,880
There's only a little bit more on the bus trip.

840
00:29:16,880 --> 00:29:20,380
The central prison is approaching closer.

841
00:29:20,850 --> 00:29:23,180
We are about to arrive, guys.

842
00:29:24,780 --> 00:29:26,780
That was really far.

843
00:29:27,350 --> 00:29:32,580
Finally, the bus with the five prisoners are about to arrive to the central prison.

844
00:29:32,580 --> 00:29:37,450
But that is not the goal! It is a new battlefield.

845
00:29:38,380 --> 00:29:40,380
Look, everyone. That...

846
00:29:40,380 --> 00:29:43,510
That is the Gaasuu Kurobikari Central Prison.

847
00:29:47,810 --> 00:29:49,210
We've arrived.

848
00:29:49,110 --> 00:29:50,880
We're here! We're here!

849
00:29:50,680 --> 00:29:52,380
We've finally arrived.

850
00:29:55,480 --> 00:30:00,980
The stage for our No-Laughter:
Gaasuu Kurobikari Central Prison.

851
00:30:02,410 --> 00:30:05,810
The first prison for rules and laughter.

852
00:30:05,810 --> 00:30:11,610
The fierce battle with assassins is about to start.

853
00:30:13,210 --> 00:30:15,710
It's a  prison?

854
00:30:15,710 --> 00:30:18,210
There aren't even any fences

855
00:30:19,750 --> 00:30:20,450
Huh?

856
00:30:21,750 --> 00:30:23,850
The bus comes right in front of the prison. That seems dangerous!

857
00:30:23,850 --> 00:30:25,110
The bus comes right in front of the prison. That seems dangerous!

858
00:30:25,710 --> 00:30:27,110
That's amazing

859
00:30:27,550 --> 00:30:32,010
The bus arrives at Central Prison

860
00:30:30,010 --> 00:30:31,410
Alright let's go everyone

861
00:30:33,150 --> 00:30:35,250
Let's go

862
00:30:40,680 --> 00:30:43,410
This is Gaasuu Kurobikari Central Prison, guys

863
00:30:43,410 --> 00:30:45,550
Guys we've arrived let's go

864
00:30:45,550 --> 00:30:47,950
Guys we've arrived let's go

865
00:30:50,350 --> 00:30:51,480
Muhoho... *cough*

866
00:30:51,480 --> 00:30:51,910
Muhoho... *cough*

867
00:30:51,910 --> 00:30:52,810
Excuse me

868
00:30:52,810 --> 00:30:54,680
Shall we go?

869
00:31:13,580 --> 00:31:15,210
He's pantomiming

870
00:31:19,980 --> 00:31:21,180
This isn't right

871
00:31:21,180 --> 00:31:22,180
Wait

872
00:31:21,580 --> 00:31:24,050
Man, I lost too

873
00:31:25,610 --> 00:31:27,610
Of course we'd lose

874
00:31:27,280 --> 00:31:29,010
It's not really like losing

875
00:31:28,980 --> 00:31:30,680
They're here they're here

876
00:31:31,780 --> 00:31:32,910
This is an endurance test

877
00:31:36,550 --> 00:31:36,580
Sure let's get off

878
00:31:40,280 --> 00:31:42,810
It's cold

879
00:31:42,810 --> 00:31:43,910
It's this way

880
00:31:44,210 --> 00:31:45,680
Right, of course

881
00:31:45,910 --> 00:31:47,080
It's cold

882
00:31:47,780 --> 00:31:50,380
Look, it's a pretty fancy building

883
00:31:49,580 --> 00:31:50,480
Yeah, it is

884
00:31:50,150 --> 00:31:51,850
It's amazing

885
00:31:52,680 --> 00:31:59,280
Prison entrance

886
00:31:52,750 --> 00:31:53,980
It's this way

887
00:31:57,880 --> 00:31:59,450
This is the entrance

888
00:31:59,480 --> 00:32:02,980
No one is here

889
00:32:00,850 --> 00:32:02,150
Really

890
00:32:01,380 --> 00:32:03,650
Gaasuu Kurobikari Central Prison...

891
00:32:04,350 --> 00:32:10,480
Prison 2nd Floor

892
00:32:05,850 --> 00:32:06,450
Listen guys

893
00:32:06,450 --> 00:32:08,010
At this end is this prison's

894
00:32:08,010 --> 00:32:10,780
At this end is this prison's

895
00:32:08,010 --> 00:32:10,780
director's office

896
00:32:10,250 --> 00:32:11,050
Prison director?

897
00:32:10,780 --> 00:32:12,880
Don't be rude

898
00:32:12,880 --> 00:32:16,250
Do prisoners go to greet the director?

899
00:32:15,250 --> 00:32:17,050
Yes, because we're prisoners

900
00:32:19,650 --> 00:32:21,450
Excuse us

901
00:32:19,650 --> 00:32:23,210
Prison director's office

902
00:32:23,310 --> 00:32:25,210
Nobody is even in here

903
00:32:25,210 --> 00:32:26,180
Oh, nobody is in here

904
00:32:26,180 --> 00:32:28,550
Just line up and wait here

905
00:32:31,510 --> 00:32:32,880
It's cold

906
00:32:37,580 --> 00:32:38,480
Oh, what happened?

907
00:32:38,480 --> 00:32:39,150
Oh, what happened?

908
00:32:39,150 --> 00:32:43,480
Mizobata Junpei

909
00:32:39,150 --> 00:32:43,480
Prison director

910
00:32:39,410 --> 00:32:40,910
This is what happened

911
00:32:40,910 --> 00:32:43,310
We wanted to greet the director

912
00:32:48,950 --> 00:32:49,850
Oh, what happened?

913
00:32:49,850 --> 00:32:50,610
Oh, what happened?

914
00:32:50,550 --> 00:32:55,510
Mizobata Junpei

915
00:32:50,550 --> 00:32:55,510
Prison director

916
00:32:50,610 --> 00:32:52,550
This is what happened

917
00:32:52,550 --> 00:32:54,110
We wanted to greet the director

918
00:32:54,110 --> 00:32:56,110
so we came here

919
00:32:56,110 --> 00:32:57,410
Is that right?

920
00:32:57,410 --> 00:33:00,310
Sorry, the director is not here right now

921
00:33:01,250 --> 00:33:03,450
Oh?

922
00:33:03,450 --> 00:33:04,710
Are you an actor or something?

923
00:33:04,710 --> 00:33:06,110
Are you an actor or something?

924
00:33:06,450 --> 00:33:08,610
No

925
00:33:07,810 --> 00:33:08,810
Oh is that so?

926
00:33:08,810 --> 00:33:09,410
excuse me

927
00:33:09,410 --> 00:33:10,650
You looked so cool so...

928
00:33:10,650 --> 00:33:13,150
You looked so cool so...

929
00:33:15,950 --> 00:33:19,150
At this moment Junpei thought

930
00:33:19,150 --> 00:33:22,150
What is with this out of fashion handsome face

931
00:33:22,150 --> 00:33:27,310
Even though he's an extra

932
00:33:23,450 --> 00:33:27,310
he's like a poorly paid actor selling himself

933
00:33:27,310 --> 00:33:29,210
Maybe his real job

934
00:33:29,210 --> 00:33:31,150
is a cheap job

935
00:33:31,150 --> 00:33:34,710
that's like Gravure Idols

936
00:33:34,710 --> 00:33:37,210
that's what he thought

937
00:33:35,510 --> 00:33:37,150
How unfair

938
00:33:38,010 --> 00:33:39,650
They're doing that now?

939
00:33:42,610 --> 00:33:44,810
I don't think it's like that

940
00:33:43,110 --> 00:33:51,510
Mystery of Director's Office

941
00:33:43,110 --> 00:33:51,510
You can hear his heart's voice

942
00:33:43,780 --> 00:33:45,380
I can believe it

943
00:33:44,910 --> 00:33:46,810
That's what you think about me?

944
00:33:52,510 --> 00:33:54,710
You think weirdly

945
00:33:54,450 --> 00:33:55,480
Oh?

946
00:33:55,480 --> 00:33:56,180
You have trash on your chin

947
00:33:56,180 --> 00:33:59,780
You have trash on your chin

948
00:34:02,550 --> 00:34:05,410
At this moment Junpei thought

949
00:34:05,410 --> 00:34:11,410
What's up with this guy's chin?

950
00:34:07,710 --> 00:34:11,410
Does he put something in it?

951
00:34:11,410 --> 00:34:12,310
What?

952
00:34:12,310 --> 00:34:13,710
Does this feel like

953
00:34:13,710 --> 00:34:16,050
a hamburg?

954
00:34:13,710 --> 00:34:18,710
T/L note: Hamburg is a popular Salisbury steak dish in Japan

955
00:34:16,050 --> 00:34:19,810
Did he put a half-eaten hamburg in his chin?

956
00:34:19,810 --> 00:34:21,750
This is what he thought

957
00:34:20,210 --> 00:34:21,710
It's a hamburg

958
00:34:22,310 --> 00:34:23,610
That's amazing

959
00:34:24,650 --> 00:34:26,050
This is...

960
00:34:26,050 --> 00:34:27,750
Why is it hamburg?

961
00:34:27,150 --> 00:34:28,580
It's not like that

962
00:34:28,580 --> 00:34:29,580
He's stupid

963
00:34:29,580 --> 00:34:31,250
He's stupid

964
00:34:33,950 --> 00:34:36,480
Mizubata-kun is thinking

965
00:34:34,410 --> 00:34:36,150
He's thinking weird things

966
00:34:36,150 --> 00:34:38,750
Everything is revealed

967
00:34:37,450 --> 00:34:39,010
What the hell

968
00:34:43,810 --> 00:34:44,910
Oh... sorry I'm late Junpei-kun

969
00:34:44,710 --> 00:34:49,010
Nishikawa Helen

970
00:34:44,710 --> 00:34:49,010
Prison Director

971
00:34:44,910 --> 00:34:48,850
Oh... sorry I'm late Junpei-kun

972
00:34:54,410 --> 00:34:57,710
I thought the director was a man

973
00:34:56,250 --> 00:34:57,450
Ahhh whaaat?

974
00:34:57,450 --> 00:34:58,480
Ahhh whaaat?

975
00:34:58,480 --> 00:35:00,980
I definitely thought it was a man

976
00:35:01,310 --> 00:35:03,480
We all thought it would be a man

977
00:35:03,480 --> 00:35:05,780
So that means

978
00:35:06,110 --> 00:35:07,210
we need guts

979
00:35:07,550 --> 00:35:10,450
These 5 new prisoners want to greet the director

980
00:35:10,380 --> 00:35:12,280
Oh is that so?

981
00:35:16,210 --> 00:35:18,280
You, what's your name?

982
00:35:18,280 --> 00:35:19,950
You, what's your name?

983
00:35:19,950 --> 00:35:20,780
It's Endo Shouzou

984
00:35:20,780 --> 00:35:23,210
It's Endo Shouzou

985
00:35:22,780 --> 00:35:23,210
Is that right?

986
00:35:23,210 --> 00:35:25,010
Nice to meet you

987
00:35:29,280 --> 00:35:32,580
At this moment Helen thought

988
00:35:32,580 --> 00:35:33,480
Hm?

989
00:35:33,480 --> 00:35:34,510
This guy

990
00:35:34,510 --> 00:35:36,980
shaves his eyebrows?

991
00:35:36,980 --> 00:35:38,410
This 40 something year old man

992
00:35:38,380 --> 00:35:42,050
is conscious about his sex appeal so he shaves his brows

993
00:35:42,050 --> 00:35:47,280
but... this eyebrow shape

994
00:35:44,650 --> 00:35:47,280
I've seen it before

995
00:35:47,280 --> 00:35:48,350
Ah!

996
00:35:48,350 --> 00:35:50,350
It's Oguri Shun!

997
00:35:50,350 --> 00:35:51,350
This guy

998
00:35:51,350 --> 00:35:52,510
is conscious about a younger actor

999
00:35:52,550 --> 00:35:56,080
Oguri Shun's eyebrows!

1000
00:35:56,080 --> 00:35:58,050
This is what she thought

1001
00:36:01,350 --> 00:36:02,850
What the hell

1002
00:36:02,050 --> 00:36:03,750
Oguri Shun?

1003
00:36:02,980 --> 00:36:13,080
Mystery of the Director's Room

1004
00:36:02,980 --> 00:36:13,080
You can hear her heart's voice

1005
00:36:04,450 --> 00:36:06,250
She's really thinking some weird things

1006
00:36:09,580 --> 00:36:11,680
She really thinks weird things about me

1007
00:36:10,250 --> 00:36:11,050
Yeah

1008
00:36:16,150 --> 00:36:17,980
You, what's your name?

1009
00:36:17,980 --> 00:36:19,810
You, what's your name?

1010
00:36:19,810 --> 00:36:22,450
It's Matsumoto Hitoshi

1011
00:36:22,450 --> 00:36:24,450
You are in very good shape

1012
00:36:24,450 --> 00:36:28,180
You are in very good shape

1013
00:36:31,510 --> 00:36:34,650
At this moment Helen thought

1014
00:36:34,650 --> 00:36:35,710
What?

1015
00:36:35,710 --> 00:36:38,450
Why is there a porn star here?

1016
00:36:38,450 --> 00:36:43,110
Among comedians,

1017
00:36:40,110 --> 00:36:43,110
why is there a porn star?

1018
00:36:43,110 --> 00:36:45,010
No, that's wrong!

1019
00:36:45,010 --> 00:36:47,780
This guy is a pro wrestler!

1020
00:36:47,780 --> 00:36:49,510
He came to announce his next pro match!

1021
00:36:49,510 --> 00:36:52,180
There's no doubt about it!

1022
00:36:51,680 --> 00:36:52,580
It's too long!

1023
00:36:52,180 --> 00:36:53,910
This is what she thought

1024
00:37:08,210 --> 00:37:09,380
My buttcheeks hurt

1025
00:37:11,550 --> 00:37:14,410
It's really hot in here

1026
00:37:14,410 --> 00:37:17,750
This room is blazing hot

1027
00:37:14,480 --> 00:37:15,580
It is hot

1028
00:37:17,750 --> 00:37:20,150
Maybe the heater is too high

1029
00:37:20,150 --> 00:37:22,210
Hot...

1030
00:37:22,210 --> 00:37:24,810
It's too hot!!

1031
00:37:28,710 --> 00:37:30,310
It's hot!!

1032
00:37:30,310 --> 00:37:33,310
It's too hot!!

1033
00:37:37,550 --> 00:37:41,950
At this moment Hamada thought

1034
00:37:41,950 --> 00:37:44,450
You're gonna wear it?!

1035
00:37:44,450 --> 00:37:47,050
This is what he thought

1036
00:37:50,450 --> 00:37:51,880
That's what I thought

1037
00:37:51,480 --> 00:37:53,010
I thought that too

1038
00:37:53,010 --> 00:37:54,480
But I thought that!!

1039
00:38:04,250 --> 00:38:08,150
You

1040
00:38:08,150 --> 00:38:09,910
You've had a sullen look on your face

1041
00:38:09,910 --> 00:38:12,410
You've had a sullen look on your face

1042
00:38:12,410 --> 00:38:13,110
No...

1043
00:38:13,110 --> 00:38:16,810
Do you have something

1044
00:38:13,110 --> 00:38:16,810
you wish to say to me?

1045
00:38:16,810 --> 00:38:17,510
Not really...

1046
00:38:17,650 --> 00:38:19,910
Say it

1047
00:38:21,350 --> 00:38:24,750
At this moment Housei thought

1048
00:38:24,750 --> 00:38:26,110
This old hag!

1049
00:38:26,110 --> 00:38:28,910
She wants to fight with me?

1050
00:38:28,910 --> 00:38:32,580
Even though I was being quiet

1051
00:38:30,410 --> 00:38:32,580
she has the nerve!

1052
00:38:32,580 --> 00:38:37,680
Even though she's just a gold digger

1053
00:38:34,010 --> 00:38:37,680
who wants more money!

1054
00:38:36,280 --> 00:38:37,680
Otherwise

1055
00:38:37,680 --> 00:38:41,610
She wouldn't have married someone like Medama!

1056
00:38:41,610 --> 00:38:44,310
This is what he thought

1057
00:38:41,680 --> 00:38:42,880
That's a messy thought

1058
00:38:43,180 --> 00:38:44,380
That's a messy thought

1059
00:38:43,480 --> 00:38:44,580
You...

1060
00:38:45,410 --> 00:38:48,450
That's what you were thinking!?

1061
00:38:47,350 --> 00:38:48,650
Scary

1062
00:38:48,450 --> 00:38:50,680
Don't make me look stupid

1063
00:38:52,550 --> 00:38:55,880
At this moment Helen thought

1064
00:38:55,880 --> 00:38:56,580
Oh!

1065
00:38:56,580 --> 00:38:57,480
Oh no!

1066
00:38:57,480 --> 00:38:58,680
How unlike me

1067
00:38:58,680 --> 00:39:02,450
to yell at a comedian who

1068
00:39:00,050 --> 00:39:02,450
only sold 40 tickets

1069
00:39:02,450 --> 00:39:06,050
in a room with a max occupancy of 140 people

1070
00:39:03,650 --> 00:39:06,050
only 3 days before

1071
00:39:06,050 --> 00:39:12,480
his solo performance!

1072
00:39:07,580 --> 00:39:10,150
I raised my voice at a poorly paid comedian!

1073
00:39:10,150 --> 00:39:12,480
This is what she thought

1074
00:39:19,250 --> 00:39:20,280
That's alright

1075
00:39:22,280 --> 00:39:24,750
I've been part of this world for 50 years!!

1076
00:39:24,750 --> 00:39:28,280
I've been part of this world for 50 years!!

1077
00:39:28,880 --> 00:39:29,980
If you humiliate me I will not tolerate it!!

1078
00:39:29,980 --> 00:39:32,550
If you humiliate me I will not tolerate it!!

1079
00:39:32,550 --> 00:39:35,310
Quickly get out of my office!

1080
00:39:33,010 --> 00:39:35,310
Quickly get out of my office!

1081
00:39:34,310 --> 00:39:36,210
Let's go

1082
00:39:34,910 --> 00:39:35,950
We're going

1083
00:39:40,050 --> 00:39:42,750
She got really pissed

1084
00:39:41,110 --> 00:39:42,310
Yes you're right

1085
00:39:41,810 --> 00:39:43,610
She's staring at us

1086
00:39:42,750 --> 00:39:45,410
She just made herself angry

1087
00:39:44,510 --> 00:39:46,050
Yeah you're right

1088
00:39:45,410 --> 00:39:55,810
the path looks like a lot of laughter traps

1089
00:39:45,410 --> 00:39:55,810
prisoner life has just begun but

1090
00:39:47,050 --> 00:39:50,310
Their long prisoner lifestyle has just begun

1091
00:39:51,010 --> 00:39:53,010
the path for the 5 guys

1092
00:39:53,010 --> 00:39:55,810
has many laughter traps in store

1093
00:39:56,110 --> 00:39:59,910
This is the newcomers' room

1094
00:39:58,410 --> 00:40:00,210
Ahhhh!

1095
00:39:59,910 --> 00:40:02,480
This is our base

1096
00:40:01,780 --> 00:40:02,910
It's cold

1097
00:40:02,480 --> 00:40:03,480
Okay get in

1098
00:40:03,610 --> 00:40:09,980
Newcomers' room

1099
00:40:03,710 --> 00:40:04,710
It's nice

1100
00:40:04,310 --> 00:40:06,010
It really is

1101
00:40:05,650 --> 00:40:07,510
It's a tatami room?!

1102
00:40:07,810 --> 00:40:09,250
Oh it is

1103
00:40:08,850 --> 00:40:12,110
Isn't it nice? The prison has prepared you a nice room

1104
00:40:09,050 --> 00:40:10,710
Oh it's a tatami room

1105
00:40:12,510 --> 00:40:13,010
Huh

1106
00:40:13,710 --> 00:40:14,510
Wow...

1107
00:40:14,710 --> 00:40:17,910
Of course there'd be drawers

1108
00:40:17,610 --> 00:40:20,310
Alright everyone, just be on standby in this room

1109
00:40:20,310 --> 00:40:26,310
2 hours since the start

1110
00:40:20,310 --> 00:40:26,310
From now on

1111
00:40:20,310 --> 00:40:26,310
it's time for Hell on Earth

1112
00:40:26,510 --> 00:40:31,110
Coming right up, it's time for the drawer pranks!

1113
00:40:32,710 --> 00:40:37,110
10:30 AM, it's time for the drawers from hell

1114
00:40:33,410 --> 00:40:37,110
Time living as a prisoner: 2 hours

1115
00:40:37,210 --> 00:40:38,510
Shall we?

1116
00:40:38,610 --> 00:40:40,210
Let's go

1117
00:40:38,610 --> 00:40:43,780
Drawer Pranks START

1118
00:40:38,780 --> 00:40:40,510
Are we going to open them?

1119
00:40:40,210 --> 00:40:41,710
Like who to start with

1120
00:40:42,510 --> 00:40:43,710
Oh right, there is that

1121
00:40:42,510 --> 00:40:46,610
Usually I start and go down in order

1122
00:40:44,010 --> 00:40:46,510
Right, that's true

1123
00:40:46,810 --> 00:40:49,010
But this year, is that how we want to do it?

1124
00:40:49,310 --> 00:40:50,010
So...

1125
00:40:51,150 --> 00:40:53,180
He's always getting scared,

1126
00:40:52,180 --> 00:40:53,180
so should we start with Tanaka?

1127
00:40:53,180 --> 00:40:56,950
This year's top batter is Tanaka

1128
00:40:53,780 --> 00:40:55,080
Let's do this

1129
00:40:55,180 --> 00:40:56,180
Okay

1130
00:40:56,810 --> 00:40:59,110
It's probably a DVD

1131
00:40:58,810 --> 00:41:01,550
In the past, there were a lot of DVDs

1132
00:40:59,480 --> 00:41:08,580
DVDs 5 years in a row

1133
00:40:59,580 --> 00:41:08,550
Defense Force

1134
00:40:59,580 --> 00:41:08,580
Airport

1135
00:40:59,580 --> 00:41:08,580
Enthusiastic Teachers

1136
00:40:59,580 --> 00:41:08,580
Hotel

1137
00:40:59,580 --> 00:41:08,580
Spy

1138
00:40:59,580 --> 00:41:08,580
Thai Kicks

1139
00:41:02,380 --> 00:41:03,980
We'll watch it later

1140
00:41:03,980 --> 00:41:07,280
Yes, alright, time to open the drawers

1141
00:41:06,080 --> 00:41:07,480
Don't like this...

1142
00:41:11,580 --> 00:41:13,680
The first drawer has nothing in it

1143
00:41:12,780 --> 00:41:13,480
Nothing?

1144
00:41:13,180 --> 00:41:13,780
Yes

1145
00:41:13,980 --> 00:41:15,880
This year there are tatami mats, so we need to be careful

1146
00:41:15,850 --> 00:41:17,180
It's slippery

1147
00:41:15,850 --> 00:41:17,180
Yes

1148
00:41:18,680 --> 00:41:19,980
The second one has nothing

1149
00:41:19,950 --> 00:41:21,750
It could be that all of them are empty

1150
00:41:21,210 --> 00:41:23,610
How about this long one?

1151
00:41:22,750 --> 00:41:24,450
Oh, well, there's still a fourth drawer at the bottom

1152
00:41:25,350 --> 00:41:27,710
The fourth one also has nothing

1153
00:41:25,810 --> 00:41:26,650
Whoa, nothing

1154
00:41:28,510 --> 00:41:29,750
Ah!!

1155
00:41:29,750 --> 00:41:31,150
A DVD

1156
00:41:31,210 --> 00:41:35,550
Mysterious DVD x 1

1157
00:41:36,250 --> 00:41:37,710
Leave that for later

1158
00:41:37,250 --> 00:41:38,450
Yeah, let's deal with this later

1159
00:41:39,210 --> 00:41:41,250
Here I go

1160
00:41:41,750 --> 00:41:43,450
From the long one

1161
00:41:44,950 --> 00:41:46,650
What!?

1162
00:41:49,850 --> 00:41:52,250
There it is

1163
00:41:51,150 --> 00:41:52,250
What's that?

1164
00:41:52,310 --> 00:42:00,950
(Secret) Prison Escape Notebook

1165
00:41:52,910 --> 00:41:55,310
Prison Escape Notebook??

1166
00:41:53,910 --> 00:41:55,110
Prison Escape Notebook...

1167
00:41:55,610 --> 00:41:56,610
Prison Escape Notebook...

1168
00:41:58,010 --> 00:41:59,910
So that means we can't look at it

1169
00:41:59,910 --> 00:42:02,410
Like it's only for Hosei

1170
00:42:01,410 --> 00:42:05,110
Right, it's not ours to look at

1171
00:42:03,110 --> 00:42:05,310
Yeah, otherwise it'd be left out in the open

1172
00:42:05,310 --> 00:42:06,310
Nothing

1173
00:42:07,110 --> 00:42:08,310
Nothing

1174
00:42:08,410 --> 00:42:10,410
Then, Matsumoto

1175
00:42:14,310 --> 00:42:16,380
Huh, me?

1176
00:42:15,410 --> 00:42:16,310
Well...

1177
00:42:17,410 --> 00:42:18,910
Should we do it this way?

1178
00:42:19,210 --> 00:42:20,210
It's fine

1179
00:42:20,210 --> 00:42:21,110
In this order, then

1180
00:42:22,910 --> 00:42:24,110
Yes, I agree

1181
00:42:24,280 --> 00:42:30,380
Smoke blast from drawer

1182
00:42:24,280 --> 00:42:30,380
The blast...

1183
00:42:25,380 --> 00:42:26,580
Right, it's always Matsumoto

1184
00:42:26,580 --> 00:42:28,080
In the past, yeah

1185
00:42:27,380 --> 00:42:30,350
I'm seriously still traumatized from those blasts

1186
00:42:30,380 --> 00:42:33,980
Just opening my drawers at home

1187
00:42:31,980 --> 00:42:33,980
sometimes makes my heart race

1188
00:42:35,480 --> 00:42:36,880
And again,

1189
00:42:36,950 --> 00:42:39,250
there's something here!!

1190
00:42:39,250 --> 00:42:40,250
It's a key

1191
00:42:40,180 --> 00:42:40,650
Key?

1192
00:42:40,610 --> 00:42:42,150
Key number 14

1193
00:42:40,610 --> 00:42:44,710
Mysterious key (no.14)

1194
00:42:42,350 --> 00:42:44,450
Well, let's just check the last one

1195
00:42:44,010 --> 00:42:44,850
Ah yes

1196
00:42:47,350 --> 00:42:48,610
Number 14...

1197
00:42:48,910 --> 00:42:57,950
Inside the room, there are lockers numbered 1 to 20

1198
00:42:49,250 --> 00:42:50,250
The lockers...

1199
00:42:50,750 --> 00:42:52,250
They're all numbered, one by one

1200
00:42:51,950 --> 00:42:52,550
Yes

1201
00:42:52,550 --> 00:42:54,050
Ah, number 14 is right here

1202
00:42:53,710 --> 00:42:54,350
Not right now

1203
00:42:54,250 --> 00:42:55,450
Oh right, let's do it later

1204
00:42:55,850 --> 00:42:56,750
Do it later?

1205
00:42:57,550 --> 00:42:59,650
Alright, I guess it's my turn

1206
00:42:59,650 --> 00:42:59,810
Whoa!?

1207
00:42:59,810 --> 00:43:01,050
Whoa!?

1208
00:42:59,850 --> 00:42:59,910
Ehh!?

1209
00:42:59,910 --> 00:43:01,050
Ehh!?

1210
00:43:01,050 --> 00:43:02,350
It's the same, the same!

1211
00:43:02,750 --> 00:43:03,350
A key

1212
00:43:03,350 --> 00:43:03,750
Key?

1213
00:43:03,750 --> 00:43:04,150
What?

1214
00:43:05,050 --> 00:43:05,850
Number 3

1215
00:43:05,850 --> 00:43:08,850
Mysterious Key (no. 3)

1216
00:43:06,750 --> 00:43:07,550
What's the number?

1217
00:43:07,550 --> 00:43:08,250
Number 3

1218
00:43:08,010 --> 00:43:08,850
Number 3

1219
00:43:11,010 --> 00:43:12,050
Nothing

1220
00:43:12,350 --> 00:43:13,550
Just the key

1221
00:43:12,650 --> 00:43:13,450
Then it's only this

1222
00:43:13,580 --> 00:43:16,610
A series of keys huh?

1223
00:43:14,810 --> 00:43:16,810
Give me a break

1224
00:43:16,680 --> 00:43:18,310
What the hell, there's 2 of them...

1225
00:43:19,350 --> 00:43:20,950
Is it okay if I go?

1226
00:43:23,150 --> 00:43:25,850
Yep!! Again, something new...

1227
00:43:25,050 --> 00:43:26,150
How scary

1228
00:43:25,250 --> 00:43:26,510
It's escalated

1229
00:43:26,450 --> 00:43:27,250
A letter

1230
00:43:27,910 --> 00:43:29,010
Something's written on here, what is this?

1231
00:43:28,480 --> 00:43:32,710
Mysterious Envelope

1232
00:43:30,310 --> 00:43:31,610
Why don't you check it out

1233
00:43:31,810 --> 00:43:32,780
Take a look

1234
00:43:32,480 --> 00:43:33,710
Should be okay to take a look

1235
00:43:33,710 --> 00:43:35,080
Ehh, this sequence is way too scary

1236
00:43:35,080 --> 00:43:37,880
Ehh, this sequence is way too scary

1237
00:43:36,810 --> 00:43:38,280
Don't know what's in there

1238
00:43:37,880 --> 00:43:40,880
In the past, there were a lot of different things

1239
00:43:41,780 --> 00:43:47,580
Instructions

1240
00:43:41,780 --> 00:43:47,580
Open the silver briefcase

1241
00:43:41,780 --> 00:43:47,580
that's in this room

1242
00:43:42,410 --> 00:43:44,680
"Open the silver briefcase that's in this room"

1243
00:43:45,410 --> 00:43:47,580
I was curious about that

1244
00:43:47,110 --> 00:43:47,710
That?

1245
00:43:47,610 --> 00:43:48,210
Oh, it's this

1246
00:43:47,710 --> 00:43:51,710
Briefcase

1247
00:43:48,410 --> 00:43:49,610
I was curious about it

1248
00:43:49,010 --> 00:43:49,580
It's that one

1249
00:43:49,510 --> 00:43:51,710
Should I take care of it now?

1250
00:43:51,750 --> 00:43:53,680
It'd be better to get it over with

1251
00:43:52,680 --> 00:43:53,880
It'd be better to just open it

1252
00:43:54,380 --> 00:43:56,150
It's pretty big, Endo

1253
00:43:56,150 --> 00:43:56,550
Oh god, so scary

1254
00:43:56,150 --> 00:43:57,280
Is it okay to look?

1255
00:43:56,550 --> 00:43:58,550
Oh god, so scary

1256
00:43:58,550 --> 00:44:00,580
Oh god, so scary!!

1257
00:43:59,780 --> 00:44:00,780
That is pretty scary

1258
00:44:00,780 --> 00:44:02,550
Briefcase

1259
00:44:00,780 --> 00:44:02,550
My heart is pounding right now

1260
00:44:02,550 --> 00:44:02,950
You don't think that Chiaki is in there, right?

1261
00:44:02,950 --> 00:44:05,950
You don't think that Chiaki is in there, right?

1262
00:44:04,280 --> 00:44:05,780
I doubt that

1263
00:44:08,150 --> 00:44:09,050
Ehh!?

1264
00:44:09,050 --> 00:44:10,080
How should I do this?

1265
00:44:10,250 --> 00:44:11,780
Can I take it over there?

1266
00:44:11,780 --> 00:44:13,980
Well, that's fine, but...

1267
00:44:11,980 --> 00:44:13,280
Sure, over there

1268
00:44:12,080 --> 00:44:14,080
Sorry, pardon me

1269
00:44:14,080 --> 00:44:15,850
Man, this is so scary

1270
00:44:16,880 --> 00:44:17,950
Is it heavy?

1271
00:44:17,950 --> 00:44:18,880
No, it's not that heavy

1272
00:44:19,680 --> 00:44:20,480
Here??

1273
00:44:20,480 --> 00:44:21,280
Is that okay?

1274
00:44:21,280 --> 00:44:23,150
Is this going to be okay?

1275
00:44:23,850 --> 00:44:25,150
But maybe it's better over there?

1276
00:44:26,080 --> 00:44:29,050
It says, "Do not turn this upside down"

1277
00:44:27,780 --> 00:44:29,150
Just like that

1278
00:44:29,150 --> 00:44:31,080
Here I go

1279
00:44:31,580 --> 00:44:34,380
Stop doing that

1280
00:44:32,580 --> 00:44:33,180
Oh, sorry

1281
00:44:35,980 --> 00:44:37,680
Huh?

1282
00:44:38,250 --> 00:44:39,050
This...

1283
00:44:40,050 --> 00:44:42,650
There's one for everyone

1284
00:44:41,710 --> 00:44:47,250
Inside are Gas Masks

1285
00:44:44,250 --> 00:44:46,510
A gas mask for Matsumoto...

1286
00:44:52,910 --> 00:44:54,410
State of emergency! State of emergency!

1287
00:44:52,910 --> 00:45:06,750
Announcement

1288
00:44:54,410 --> 00:44:59,910
State of emergency! State of emergency!

1289
00:44:56,250 --> 00:44:59,910
At this time, a strong odorous gas is leaking within the prison

1290
00:44:57,750 --> 00:44:58,850
So scary

1291
00:44:59,910 --> 00:45:06,750
For those who are indoors,

1292
00:45:00,910 --> 00:45:06,750
put on a protective mask immediately!

1293
00:45:03,950 --> 00:45:05,550
Hold on, hold on

1294
00:45:07,510 --> 00:45:08,150
It's on

1295
00:45:08,150 --> 00:45:09,350
It's on

1296
00:45:08,510 --> 00:45:09,350
It's on

1297
00:45:09,410 --> 00:45:18,210
Announcement

1298
00:45:10,550 --> 00:45:18,210
At this time, the source is being secured and disposed

1299
00:45:14,910 --> 00:45:18,210
Those who are indoors, please remove your protective masks

1300
00:45:19,110 --> 00:45:21,250
What the hell, that was unexpected!!

1301
00:45:21,250 --> 00:45:21,950
That surprised me

1302
00:45:23,810 --> 00:45:27,850
Hosei in a strange predicament...

1303
00:45:27,250 --> 00:45:28,850
It's okay to remove it now

1304
00:45:36,550 --> 00:45:38,350
I could've died

1305
00:45:39,010 --> 00:45:40,250
I could've died

1306
00:45:40,250 --> 00:45:46,150
Adhesive in Hosei's Mask

1307
00:45:46,310 --> 00:45:48,450
This is no good!

1308
00:45:46,310 --> 00:45:50,650
Proper safety measures were taken

1309
00:45:50,580 --> 00:45:53,180
I was wondering what the hell you were doing

1310
00:45:53,180 --> 00:45:54,580
That's what it was

1311
00:45:54,580 --> 00:45:55,650
Scary

1312
00:45:57,180 --> 00:45:58,280
That surprised me

1313
00:45:57,950 --> 00:45:59,780
I seriously thought, "What is he doing?"

1314
00:45:59,980 --> 00:46:00,950
So very scary

1315
00:46:01,010 --> 00:46:03,150
Why was that in Endo's drawer...

1316
00:46:01,880 --> 00:46:03,480
You really might've died

1317
00:46:03,150 --> 00:46:04,550
Could've killed me

1318
00:46:04,750 --> 00:46:06,480
I suddenly couldn't breathe, seriously

1319
00:46:13,680 --> 00:46:14,480
That's dangerous

1320
00:46:14,550 --> 00:46:16,180
Stop that please

1321
00:46:16,180 --> 00:46:17,780
Really though, that's dangerous

1322
00:46:18,080 --> 00:46:20,550
That's really scary

1323
00:46:21,050 --> 00:46:22,280
What is this?

1324
00:46:21,380 --> 00:46:22,580
What is that?

1325
00:46:25,250 --> 00:46:27,350
It might not have been harmful, but...

1326
00:46:27,650 --> 00:46:28,850
How about the others?

1327
00:46:29,110 --> 00:46:30,110
There's nothing else

1328
00:46:31,110 --> 00:46:32,410
Matsumoto, that...

1329
00:46:32,410 --> 00:46:34,950
Damnit

1330
00:46:35,850 --> 00:46:37,910
Geez, way too scary

1331
00:46:37,950 --> 00:46:41,110
Mysterious Key (no. 14)

1332
00:46:38,610 --> 00:46:39,610
Number 14

1333
00:46:39,610 --> 00:46:40,410
This was the first one

1334
00:46:40,410 --> 00:46:40,910
Yes

1335
00:46:41,280 --> 00:46:43,480
It's this one here

1336
00:46:43,480 --> 00:46:45,910
It's small

1337
00:46:43,480 --> 00:46:46,410
Locker number 14

1338
00:46:44,380 --> 00:46:46,410
I don't want to do this...

1339
00:46:46,980 --> 00:46:49,580
Even if you say it's small...

1340
00:46:50,610 --> 00:46:52,480
It's still very scary

1341
00:46:51,780 --> 00:46:53,210
Yeah, it's still scary

1342
00:47:06,580 --> 00:47:08,880
What is that?

1343
00:47:07,180 --> 00:47:08,880
What!?

1344
00:47:09,580 --> 00:47:10,010
A pumpkin...

1345
00:47:10,010 --> 00:47:15,680
Mysterious Pumpkin

1346
00:47:11,110 --> 00:47:12,110
That's pretty big...

1347
00:47:15,080 --> 00:47:15,680
What?

1348
00:47:16,610 --> 00:47:18,180
How scary

1349
00:47:17,850 --> 00:47:18,580
That is scary

1350
00:47:22,250 --> 00:47:23,980
Pft heehee fufu...

1351
00:47:33,280 --> 00:47:34,650
Halloween?

1352
00:47:37,050 --> 00:47:38,480
A Halloween pumpkin?

1353
00:47:37,050 --> 00:47:39,550
It's a pumpkin monster

1354
00:47:39,550 --> 00:47:40,510
But the timing is...

1355
00:47:40,510 --> 00:47:42,710
It's already over

1356
00:47:41,150 --> 00:47:42,510
It's New Year's Eve already

1357
00:47:50,810 --> 00:47:52,650
Helloween?

1358
00:47:54,510 --> 00:47:57,050
It's a pumpkin monster

1359
00:47:54,550 --> 00:47:56,050
A Halloween pumpkin?

1360
00:47:57,050 --> 00:47:58,010
But the timing is...

1361
00:47:58,010 --> 00:48:00,250
It's already over

1362
00:48:10,280 --> 00:48:11,810
You can't do that!!

1363
00:48:12,210 --> 00:48:13,610
That's amazing!

1364
00:48:13,380 --> 00:48:14,780
Pisses me off!!

1365
00:48:14,780 --> 00:48:15,880
You can't not laugh at that!

1366
00:48:14,780 --> 00:48:17,880
Artwork of Hamada's Face

1367
00:48:15,780 --> 00:48:17,180
That's amazing

1368
00:48:21,410 --> 00:48:23,880
This is incredible

1369
00:48:22,610 --> 00:48:24,910
This is very high quality

1370
00:48:24,910 --> 00:48:26,810
It turned out so well

1371
00:48:25,110 --> 00:48:27,880
Who makes this kind of stuff?

1372
00:48:27,050 --> 00:48:28,780
That's really good

1373
00:48:28,810 --> 00:48:29,410
This is...

1374
00:48:29,650 --> 00:48:31,010
The wig he's wearing today...

1375
00:48:30,350 --> 00:48:31,110
That's right

1376
00:48:31,650 --> 00:48:32,610
They matched it for today

1377
00:48:32,650 --> 00:48:33,810
Can't do this

1378
00:48:32,650 --> 00:48:33,980
Right now

1379
00:48:35,450 --> 00:48:37,110
This crosses the space-time continuum

1380
00:48:37,350 --> 00:48:41,850
They predicted this and did it

1381
00:48:38,650 --> 00:48:40,650
That was the case

1382
00:48:42,110 --> 00:48:43,050
I'm going to put this away

1383
00:48:43,850 --> 00:48:44,850
Amazing

1384
00:48:45,550 --> 00:48:46,950
What kind of expression is that?

1385
00:48:46,250 --> 00:48:47,150
Geez...

1386
00:48:47,150 --> 00:48:51,680
Hosei's sticky stuff is

1387
00:48:48,550 --> 00:48:51,680
Hosei's sticky stuff is

1388
00:48:49,250 --> 00:48:51,680
stuck all over the place

1389
00:48:50,650 --> 00:48:51,850
Isn't it?

1390
00:48:52,650 --> 00:48:55,050
Look at the prison escape notebook

1391
00:48:52,650 --> 00:48:55,050
on your own

1392
00:48:54,450 --> 00:48:55,680
Oh, that's right

1393
00:48:56,350 --> 00:48:58,680
But really, it's kinda scary

1394
00:48:58,910 --> 00:49:01,080
Alright, gonna look!!

1395
00:49:00,410 --> 00:49:01,110
Oh, you're going to look?

1396
00:49:01,080 --> 00:49:01,810
Are you going to look?

1397
00:49:01,610 --> 00:49:02,210
I will

1398
00:49:02,210 --> 00:49:04,080
Well, for now, Yamasaki will look

1399
00:49:03,780 --> 00:49:04,210
Yes

1400
00:49:04,210 --> 00:49:07,510
Why does only Yamasaki get the Prison Escape Notebook?

1401
00:49:04,210 --> 00:49:09,810
(Secret) Prison Escape Notebook

1402
00:49:07,280 --> 00:49:07,610
Yeah

1403
00:49:09,810 --> 00:49:10,610
To whoever finds this notebook,

1404
00:49:10,410 --> 00:49:13,910
To whoever finds this notebook,

1405
00:49:10,410 --> 00:49:29,610
Prison Escape Notebook

1406
00:49:13,410 --> 00:49:16,610
It took me 10 years to finish,

1407
00:49:15,610 --> 00:49:18,910
but these are my notes on how to get out of the prison

1408
00:49:19,010 --> 00:49:21,010
through a secret escape route.

1409
00:49:21,010 --> 00:49:22,910
through a secret escape route.

1410
00:49:22,080 --> 00:49:24,910
Those who find this,

1411
00:49:24,210 --> 00:49:27,210
promptly use the escape route

1412
00:49:26,310 --> 00:49:29,610
to break out of the prison.

1413
00:49:27,410 --> 00:49:29,610
From the Prison Escape King

1414
00:49:28,610 --> 00:49:30,110
Wait, really?

1415
00:49:29,110 --> 00:49:30,580
Is it telling all of us to do that?

1416
00:49:29,610 --> 00:49:30,110
From the Prison Escape King

1417
00:49:29,610 --> 00:49:30,110
Prison Escape Notebook

1418
00:49:29,610 --> 00:49:30,110
to break out of the prison

1419
00:49:31,250 --> 00:49:33,380
It says "to whoever finds this"

1420
00:49:32,580 --> 00:49:33,380
"Whoever finds this"...

1421
00:49:33,380 --> 00:49:35,980
"To whoever finds this notebook, promptly..."

1422
00:49:36,050 --> 00:49:36,650
What!?

1423
00:49:37,010 --> 00:49:39,310
There's a sketch

1424
00:49:39,810 --> 00:49:42,810
If you remove this door

1425
00:49:39,810 --> 00:49:42,810
there lies the escape route

1426
00:49:43,110 --> 00:49:53,510
In the Prison Escape Notebook, the escape route is drawn on a map

1427
00:49:48,750 --> 00:49:50,010
Is there a map?

1428
00:49:49,050 --> 00:49:50,950
There is a map

1429
00:49:50,110 --> 00:49:50,950
In this room?

1430
00:49:53,650 --> 00:50:16,510
If you remove this door,

1431
00:49:53,650 --> 00:50:16,510
Prison Escape Notebook

1432
00:49:53,650 --> 00:50:16,510
Sketch of the Room

1433
00:49:53,650 --> 00:50:16,510
there lies the escape route

1434
00:49:55,950 --> 00:49:58,250
What door?

1435
00:49:57,250 --> 00:49:59,450
There isn't one, but maybe it's a disguised door

1436
00:49:59,050 --> 00:50:00,050
Door?

1437
00:50:00,050 --> 00:50:01,150
Is it here?

1438
00:50:06,050 --> 00:50:09,110
How is it situated?

1439
00:50:09,310 --> 00:50:10,550
It's like this and like that

1440
00:50:10,850 --> 00:50:11,550
This

1441
00:50:11,310 --> 00:50:13,610
It's the locker!!

1442
00:50:12,610 --> 00:50:13,550
If we move it...

1443
00:50:13,610 --> 00:50:15,550
Ah!!

1444
00:50:13,950 --> 00:50:15,550
Ah!!

1445
00:50:15,550 --> 00:50:16,850
Ah!!

1446
00:50:16,850 --> 00:50:19,210
It's a fake locker

1447
00:50:27,250 --> 00:50:29,250
Isn't it impossible if you don't move it out of the way?

1448
00:50:30,310 --> 00:50:32,110
And you're laughing.

1449
00:50:33,410 --> 00:50:35,410
You’re all laughing as if everything's fine.

1450
00:50:36,250 --> 00:50:37,710
As if you're all at peace and in harmony.

1451
00:50:37,210 --> 00:50:39,110
I thought I could go through the locker...

1452
00:50:41,210 --> 00:50:43,350
Your reaction there was also...

1453
00:50:41,710 --> 00:50:43,350
He was laughing there.

1454
00:50:43,810 --> 00:50:44,980
Let me help.

1455
00:50:44,680 --> 00:50:44,910
There

1456
00:50:44,910 --> 00:50:45,110
There

1457
00:50:45,110 --> 00:50:45,380
There

1458
00:50:45,380 --> 00:50:45,710
There

1459
00:50:45,710 --> 00:50:46,380
There

1460
00:50:46,380 --> 00:50:48,150
Wow!!

1461
00:50:47,150 --> 00:50:48,250
That’s it.

1462
00:50:52,050 --> 00:50:53,450
Huh!?

1463
00:50:53,450 --> 00:50:55,180
Where does this go?

1464
00:50:53,480 --> 00:50:54,580
You can escape.

1465
00:50:55,750 --> 00:50:57,780
Open that.

1466
00:50:57,780 --> 00:50:59,650
Just open and go through, right?

1467
00:51:00,850 --> 00:51:02,150
Whoa!!

1468
00:51:01,250 --> 00:51:02,150
Whoa!!

1469
00:51:01,850 --> 00:51:03,450
What is this?

1470
00:51:02,980 --> 00:51:07,150
A secret escape route

1471
00:51:03,180 --> 00:51:04,450
That's amazing.

1472
00:51:04,250 --> 00:51:04,950
You're kidding.

1473
00:51:06,350 --> 00:51:07,550
You can escape.

1474
00:51:07,050 --> 00:51:08,350
Yes, you can make it.

1475
00:51:13,480 --> 00:51:15,950
Why just Hosei?

1476
00:51:16,380 --> 00:51:21,810
*Note: Hosei did not use honorifics in his speech here, which is an inappropriate way for him to speak to his seniors, Downtown.  Matsumoto reacts to that.

1477
00:51:16,380 --> 00:51:21,810
I’m gonna go check it out.*

1478
00:51:18,550 --> 00:51:21,810
Who the hell do you think you’re talking to?

1479
00:51:22,080 --> 00:51:24,410
Like “I’m gonna go.”

1480
00:51:24,510 --> 00:51:27,180
I will check it out.

1481
00:51:27,180 --> 00:51:29,150
If I’m able to escape, um...

1482
00:51:29,150 --> 00:51:30,010
If I’m able to escape, um...

1483
00:51:30,010 --> 00:51:30,680
I'll come again.

1484
00:51:30,680 --> 00:51:32,510
I'll come again.

1485
00:51:35,350 --> 00:51:37,250
Like idiots trying to have a conversation.

1486
00:51:41,010 --> 00:51:43,050
Without any sense of gravity of the situation.

1487
00:51:44,910 --> 00:51:46,410
What, are you coming back to visit a sick friend?

1488
00:51:45,910 --> 00:51:48,650
You're not going to escape?

1489
00:51:52,510 --> 00:51:54,910
I’ll help everyone escape.

1490
00:51:54,410 --> 00:51:55,650
Ah, I see.

1491
00:51:57,110 --> 00:51:58,850
You’ll be fine leaving this prison escape notebook here?

1492
00:51:58,850 --> 00:51:59,610
You’ll be fine leaving this prison escape notebook here?

1493
00:51:59,610 --> 00:52:01,610
Is that fine, Hosei?

1494
00:52:01,610 --> 00:52:02,550
He went on.

1495
00:52:02,550 --> 00:52:03,450
He ignored us.

1496
00:52:03,850 --> 00:52:05,350
What is this?

1497
00:52:05,350 --> 00:52:06,550
It’s scary, isn’t it?

1498
00:52:06,110 --> 00:52:07,010
It’s scary.

1499
00:52:06,710 --> 00:52:08,550
Who knows what's coming.

1500
00:52:09,850 --> 00:52:12,410
And you can guess it’s not going to be anything good.

1501
00:52:30,830 --> 00:52:32,170
It's open.

1502
00:52:34,630 --> 00:52:39,150
*Note: Kida Taro is a composer.

1503
00:52:34,630 --> 00:52:39,150
Kida Taro* is defecating

1504
00:52:38,170 --> 00:52:39,530
I've never seen that before.

1505
00:52:43,730 --> 00:52:44,930
What are you doing?

1506
00:52:47,030 --> 00:52:49,930
He was laughing like crazy.

1507
00:52:50,070 --> 00:52:52,070
What’s going on?

1508
00:52:51,230 --> 00:52:53,570
It’s the first time for us to see it.

1509
00:52:52,130 --> 00:52:54,230
What the hell…

1510
00:52:52,770 --> 00:52:54,030
Yes.

1511
00:52:58,270 --> 00:52:59,530
He’s back.

1512
00:52:59,330 --> 00:53:00,430
He’s come back.

1513
00:52:59,530 --> 00:53:01,330
You got smacked?

1514
00:53:01,330 --> 00:53:03,830
You got smacked, right?

1515
00:53:03,070 --> 00:53:03,830
Yes, but

1516
00:53:03,830 --> 00:53:04,680
I made it.

1517
00:53:04,680 --> 00:53:06,680
We can make it.

1518
00:53:05,850 --> 00:53:06,850
Really?

1519
00:53:06,480 --> 00:53:07,580
We can really make it.

1520
00:53:07,710 --> 00:53:09,780
Matsumoto, could you…

1521
00:53:09,880 --> 00:53:10,680
Just in case

1522
00:53:10,980 --> 00:53:13,580
If you just learned the route now

1523
00:53:12,380 --> 00:53:13,580
it’ll definitely be good!

1524
00:53:13,580 --> 00:53:19,050
Hosei guides the next victim

1525
00:53:14,950 --> 00:53:17,450
Since we have to find our way out in the end.

1526
00:53:17,880 --> 00:53:19,180
Why me?

1527
00:53:19,180 --> 00:53:21,180
I just wanted to show you.

1528
00:53:21,380 --> 00:53:22,750
If you can make it out.

1529
00:53:22,050 --> 00:53:24,850
Huh, why is it me?

1530
00:53:28,950 --> 00:53:30,980
Ok, I’m gonna go.

1531
00:53:36,180 --> 00:53:37,850
Whoa!!

1532
00:53:41,580 --> 00:53:44,180
It’s pretty long, huh?

1533
00:53:43,350 --> 00:53:44,350
Right?

1534
00:53:44,280 --> 00:53:46,650
It's pretty long.

1535
00:54:15,500 --> 00:54:17,210
Huh!?

1536
00:54:30,900 --> 00:54:33,410
Wow!!

1537
00:54:32,240 --> 00:54:33,400
You're doing that as well.

1538
00:54:37,110 --> 00:54:40,150
*Note: Shibata Rie is a comedian and tarento.

1539
00:54:37,110 --> 00:54:40,150
Shibata Rie* is defecating

1540
00:54:42,910 --> 00:54:43,110
Ahahahaha!

1541
00:54:43,110 --> 00:54:46,510
Ahahahaha!

1542
00:54:45,850 --> 00:54:47,210
Huh?

1543
00:54:46,680 --> 00:54:49,380
He’s laughing like crazy.

1544
00:54:47,610 --> 00:54:49,180
What?

1545
00:54:49,380 --> 00:54:50,810
What is it?

1546
00:54:50,810 --> 00:54:52,310
He’s laughing like crazy.

1547
00:54:56,610 --> 00:54:59,310
Geez!!

1548
00:54:59,480 --> 00:55:00,510
He isn't escaping at all.

1549
00:55:00,510 --> 00:55:03,180
He isn't escaping at all.

1550
00:55:02,010 --> 00:55:03,180
Seriously.

1551
00:55:03,180 --> 00:55:04,980
Haha

1552
00:55:04,280 --> 00:55:06,210
But the route is really…

1553
00:55:08,410 --> 00:55:11,350
He was laughing so much.

1554
00:55:09,880 --> 00:55:11,080
Oh yeah.

1555
00:55:11,350 --> 00:55:13,550
You all as well.

1556
00:55:16,880 --> 00:55:19,080
He’s come back now.

1557
00:55:20,980 --> 00:55:23,280
That’s amazing.

1558
00:55:22,280 --> 00:55:23,080
Right?

1559
00:55:23,510 --> 00:55:24,510
Wow.

1560
00:55:23,510 --> 00:55:25,280
Escape!?

1561
00:55:24,680 --> 00:55:25,380
We can get out.

1562
00:55:25,380 --> 00:55:27,480
"We can get out," I thought

1563
00:55:28,080 --> 00:55:29,750
And I got excited.

1564
00:55:29,750 --> 00:55:31,450
And that caused me to go  "Babaam!"

1565
00:55:35,650 --> 00:55:37,080
Right?

1566
00:55:37,450 --> 00:55:42,080
Firstly, having our seniors

1567
00:55:39,250 --> 00:55:42,080
escape first would be…

1568
00:55:40,550 --> 00:55:42,080
That’s right, we’ll…

1569
00:55:42,450 --> 00:55:46,180
The next victim is Hamada

1570
00:55:42,680 --> 00:55:44,080
Thus,

1571
00:55:44,080 --> 00:55:46,080
the next victim is Hamada.

1572
00:55:46,950 --> 00:55:47,710
You can just go ahead and escape.

1573
00:55:47,710 --> 00:55:50,850
You can just go ahead and escape.

1574
00:55:49,450 --> 00:55:51,050
I’ll just lead the two of them out.

1575
00:55:51,310 --> 00:55:53,680
Since you know the route.

1576
00:55:54,750 --> 00:55:54,980
What?

1577
00:55:54,980 --> 00:55:55,250
What?

1578
00:55:55,250 --> 00:55:56,880
What?

1579
00:56:00,210 --> 00:56:02,110
Here?

1580
00:56:03,810 --> 00:56:05,980
Kida Taro is defecating again

1581
00:56:06,350 --> 00:56:09,280
You could see it  already.

1582
00:56:09,550 --> 00:56:10,750
You could see it?

1583
00:56:09,810 --> 00:56:10,750
You could see it?

1584
00:56:10,810 --> 00:56:12,010
The entrance or the exit.

1585
00:56:12,010 --> 00:56:15,780
I don’t know if it’s an entrance or an exit, but you could see it.

1586
00:56:12,810 --> 00:56:14,010
Oh, you could already...

1587
00:56:13,910 --> 00:56:15,350
You could get out.

1588
00:56:16,080 --> 00:56:20,010
It hadn't come out  yet, as in...

1589
00:56:18,450 --> 00:56:20,410
It hadn’t come out yet, but...

1590
00:56:20,010 --> 00:56:21,780
You had gotten that far out, is what you mean?

1591
00:56:21,110 --> 00:56:22,650
Could have gone out but didn’t.

1592
00:56:22,080 --> 00:56:23,880
Had gotten that far out?

1593
00:56:23,880 --> 00:56:26,580
Had gotten that far out?

1594
00:56:26,850 --> 00:56:29,210
So I can just get out?

1595
00:56:32,010 --> 00:56:33,150
Here he comes.

1596
00:56:33,150 --> 00:56:34,910
That's how you open it?

1597
00:56:39,210 --> 00:56:40,650
That’s just…

1598
00:56:41,410 --> 00:56:43,410
It had gotten that far out.

1599
00:56:43,510 --> 00:56:47,180
Mfhahahaha!

1600
00:56:50,580 --> 00:56:53,580
That's excitement from

1601
00:56:50,580 --> 00:56:53,580
being able to get out?

1602
00:56:52,280 --> 00:56:54,010
He was laughing a lot.

1603
00:56:53,310 --> 00:56:55,480
Being able to get out, or...

1604
00:56:55,150 --> 00:56:57,610
It doesn’t sound like that kind of laughter, though.

1605
00:57:01,580 --> 00:57:02,910
This guy’s all rough.

1606
00:57:03,410 --> 00:57:04,680
There are those rough ones.

1607
00:57:04,210 --> 00:57:05,780
He’s just putting them back on as if everything's fine.

1608
00:57:06,880 --> 00:57:07,880
As if everything's fine.

1609
00:57:07,450 --> 00:57:09,050
A little got out, I think?

1610
00:57:09,050 --> 00:57:12,710
A little might have gotten out already.

1611
00:57:12,710 --> 00:57:14,980
So they're able to get out a little.

1612
00:57:14,180 --> 00:57:16,580
A little got out already.

1613
00:57:14,810 --> 00:57:16,580
Oh, Hamada’s back.

1614
00:57:17,050 --> 00:57:19,580
Does an escape look possible?

1615
00:57:18,980 --> 00:57:19,680
Mmm.

1616
00:57:19,580 --> 00:57:21,850
Like, is it already coming out?

1617
00:57:22,180 --> 00:57:24,180
Already coming out?

1618
00:57:22,180 --> 00:57:24,180
Already coming out?

1619
00:57:24,180 --> 00:57:27,310
We’re able to come out,

1620
00:57:27,310 --> 00:57:29,780
but their side is also kind of coming out.

1621
00:57:29,780 --> 00:57:31,650
What's their side?

1622
00:57:34,080 --> 00:57:35,050
What’s their side?

1623
00:57:34,850 --> 00:57:36,050
Their side?

1624
00:57:35,950 --> 00:57:37,050
Their side...

1625
00:57:37,150 --> 00:57:39,050
Their side?

1626
00:57:37,780 --> 00:57:39,380
Their side is also coming out...

1627
00:57:39,380 --> 00:57:40,480
No, you see, you see.

1628
00:57:40,480 --> 00:57:41,280
No, you see, you see.

1629
00:57:45,880 --> 00:57:47,050
You see...

1630
00:57:46,580 --> 00:57:47,550
Wait.

1631
00:57:48,350 --> 00:57:49,950
Yes, yes.

1632
00:57:50,210 --> 00:57:52,610
Who was it?

1633
00:57:52,750 --> 00:57:54,010
When you went.

1634
00:57:54,150 --> 00:57:57,180
It was the same, right?

1635
00:57:54,150 --> 00:57:57,180
The same…

1636
00:57:57,510 --> 00:57:58,550
Did you see the face?

1637
00:57:58,550 --> 00:58:00,780
Did you see the face?

1638
00:57:59,610 --> 00:58:01,150
I saw it.

1639
00:58:01,610 --> 00:58:05,550
Glasses, right?

1640
00:58:02,450 --> 00:58:05,550
Someone you'd call a sensei*.

1641
00:58:02,450 --> 00:58:07,550
*Note: Here, sensei is an honorific used for people of certain professions that are considered traditionally high-end or academic, including musical composers.

1642
00:58:05,550 --> 00:58:09,380
Someone you'd call a sensei?

1643
00:58:09,380 --> 00:58:11,110
A sensei?

1644
00:58:11,110 --> 00:58:12,780
A sensei?

1645
00:58:11,980 --> 00:58:13,310
Well, right?

1646
00:58:13,080 --> 00:58:14,080
Right.

1647
00:58:15,210 --> 00:58:18,010
It was the same, right?

1648
00:58:18,180 --> 00:58:20,010
Kida Taro?

1649
00:58:20,010 --> 00:58:22,580
It wasn't.

1650
00:58:21,080 --> 00:58:22,280
What?

1651
00:58:23,680 --> 00:58:24,410
What’s the matter?

1652
00:58:26,780 --> 00:58:28,380
What is it?

1653
00:58:27,680 --> 00:58:28,480
You’re kidding.

1654
00:58:28,680 --> 00:58:30,480
What’s going on?

1655
00:58:35,180 --> 00:58:37,410
No, you see, if you go in, it leads to a bathroom.

1656
00:58:37,410 --> 00:58:40,550
No, you see, if you go in, it leads to a bathroom.

1657
00:58:40,550 --> 00:58:42,380
So you can get out through a bathroom

1658
00:58:42,380 --> 00:58:43,880
So you can get out through a bathroom

1659
00:58:43,980 --> 00:58:46,110
But when I and Yama-chan looked up

1660
00:58:46,110 --> 00:58:48,380
Kida Taro was there with his butt out

1661
00:58:48,380 --> 00:58:50,110
taking a dump.

1662
00:58:50,110 --> 00:58:51,110
It came out.

1663
00:58:55,780 --> 00:58:58,480
Then I was different.

1664
00:58:58,350 --> 00:58:59,950
It was a different person?

1665
00:59:01,750 --> 00:59:04,210
How many people are there, then?

1666
00:59:04,080 --> 00:59:05,380
It was different?

1667
00:59:05,980 --> 00:59:07,750
That’s where...

1668
00:59:07,750 --> 00:59:10,880
That’s where they put in

1669
00:59:08,950 --> 00:59:10,880
a large number of personnel?

1670
00:59:11,480 --> 00:59:14,480
That’s unbelievable!!

1671
00:59:12,250 --> 00:59:14,450
That is...

1672
00:59:14,950 --> 00:59:15,680
Well, anyway, then just...

1673
00:59:15,680 --> 00:59:17,680
Well, anyway, then just...

1674
00:59:17,150 --> 00:59:18,080
There’s two…

1675
00:59:17,680 --> 00:59:21,650
Watch it at the studio!!

1676
00:59:20,350 --> 00:59:21,180
Just... yes.

1677
00:59:21,180 --> 00:59:21,650
Just... yes.

1678
00:59:22,880 --> 00:59:25,480
Three hours into prison life.

1679
00:59:24,180 --> 00:59:27,650
The desk drawer pranks continue.

1680
00:59:25,480 --> 00:59:27,550
Three hours into prison life

1681
00:59:28,280 --> 00:59:29,250
Should we watch it?

1682
00:59:29,250 --> 00:59:31,380
Well, let’s get it out of the way.

1683
00:59:29,310 --> 00:59:32,710
1 mysterious DVD

1684
00:59:31,710 --> 00:59:33,050
That’ll be everything, right?

1685
00:59:32,910 --> 00:59:33,750
Yes.

1686
00:59:33,350 --> 00:59:33,750
Yes.

1687
00:59:33,750 --> 00:59:35,650
Once we watch this, that’ll be everything

1688
00:59:34,050 --> 00:59:35,410
Yes, we might as well.

1689
00:59:35,650 --> 00:59:37,250
inside the desk drawers.

1690
00:59:37,950 --> 00:59:39,810
Because of last year, you know.

1691
00:59:39,110 --> 00:59:41,210
I know, really.

1692
00:59:39,950 --> 00:59:48,010
A thank you letter from one’s son led to a Thai kick

1693
00:59:39,950 --> 00:59:48,010
Last year’s DVD

1694
00:59:41,250 --> 00:59:42,350
This fearful thing.

1695
00:59:42,050 --> 00:59:43,910
Not one good thing has come from this.

1696
00:59:43,910 --> 00:59:45,210
Here goes.

1697
00:59:45,510 --> 00:59:46,510
You're all flustered.

1698
00:59:45,810 --> 00:59:47,350
It’s just one DVD this year?

1699
00:59:47,350 --> 00:59:48,650
Just one.

1700
01:00:00,560 --> 01:00:06,710
Illustration, Artwork:

1701
01:00:00,560 --> 01:00:06,710

1702
01:00:00,560 --> 01:00:06,710
Munakata Jou

1703
01:00:00,560 --> 01:00:06,710
Muscly Old Man

1704
01:00:00,560 --> 01:00:06,710
Storyboard:

1705
01:00:08,100 --> 01:00:09,500
Once upon a time, long, long ago

1706
01:00:09,500 --> 01:00:11,160
Once upon a time, long, long ago

1707
01:00:10,400 --> 01:00:11,360
What's this?

1708
01:00:11,300 --> 01:00:12,460
there lived a kind-hearted man, Old Man Tanaka.

1709
01:00:12,460 --> 01:00:14,760
there lived a kind-hearted man, Old Man Tanaka.

1710
01:00:17,300 --> 01:00:18,600
Old Man Tanaka just loved animals

1711
01:00:18,600 --> 01:00:21,000
Old Man Tanaka just loved animals

1712
01:00:20,360 --> 01:00:22,160
This seems...

1713
01:00:21,000 --> 01:00:23,400
and he loved his dog

1714
01:00:23,400 --> 01:00:25,360
as if it were his own son.

1715
01:00:24,660 --> 01:00:26,460
This seems kind of…

1716
01:00:26,260 --> 01:00:27,700
Oh, Shiro

1717
01:00:27,700 --> 01:00:28,660
you are so cute.

1718
01:00:28,660 --> 01:00:30,360
you are so cute.

1719
01:00:30,360 --> 01:00:32,160
There, there.

1720
01:00:32,260 --> 01:00:34,360
Next to him lived Old Man Matsumoto.

1721
01:00:34,360 --> 01:00:36,360
Next to him lived Old Man Matsumoto.

1722
01:00:37,060 --> 01:00:39,360
Old Man Matsumoto just

1723
01:00:39,360 --> 01:00:41,200
loved muscles, and

1724
01:00:41,200 --> 01:00:43,200
he loves his tight t-shirt

1725
01:00:45,660 --> 01:00:47,300
We’re going to stop-and-start this frequently here?

1726
01:00:47,300 --> 01:00:48,760
We’re going to stop-and-start this frequently here?

1727
01:00:48,760 --> 01:00:50,360
I guess so.

1728
01:00:51,400 --> 01:00:53,660
This is like Jimmy's section*, isn't it?

1729
01:00:51,400 --> 01:00:55,660
*Note: Jimmy refers to Jimmy Onishi, who often appears in videos during the New Year's batsu game episodes.

1730
01:00:53,560 --> 01:00:54,900
This frequently?

1731
01:00:57,960 --> 01:01:00,160
Old Man Matsumoto just

1732
01:01:00,160 --> 01:01:02,200
loves  his muscles, and

1733
01:01:02,200 --> 01:01:03,660
loved his tight t-shirt

1734
01:01:03,660 --> 01:01:06,700
as if it were his own son.

1735
01:01:06,700 --> 01:01:07,960
ghjghjghjghjghj

1736
01:01:07,400 --> 01:01:09,060
T-shirts gotta be one size smaller and from Avirex.  Only way to go.

1737
01:01:09,060 --> 01:01:12,200
T-shirts gotta be one size smaller and from Avirex.  Only way to go.

1738
01:01:12,200 --> 01:01:13,300
That's not true.

1739
01:01:13,100 --> 01:01:15,000
One day,

1740
01:01:20,810 --> 01:01:23,510
Old man Matsumoto as usual

1741
01:01:23,510 --> 01:01:25,610
was working out in the mountains when

1742
01:01:29,150 --> 01:01:33,210
What the hell, be quiet, I'm working out over here!

1743
01:01:33,650 --> 01:01:39,150
When he looked, there stood Old man Tanaka and his dog, Shiro

1744
01:01:39,510 --> 01:01:41,310
Shiro-han, what's wrong?

1745
01:01:43,950 --> 01:01:47,750
I have no idea what you mean, but do you want me to dig here?

1746
01:01:48,350 --> 01:01:49,050
There, there.

1747
01:01:49,950 --> 01:01:54,150
And when old man Tanaka dug where Shiro told him to...

1748
01:01:54,250 --> 01:01:59,410
Protein

1749
01:01:54,250 --> 01:01:59,410
Protein

1750
01:01:54,250 --> 01:01:59,410
Protein

1751
01:01:54,250 --> 01:01:59,410
Protein

1752
01:01:54,250 --> 01:01:59,410
Protein

1753
01:01:55,010 --> 01:01:57,810
My God, what is this? It's protein!

1754
01:01:58,310 --> 01:01:59,310
I'm speechless!

1755
01:02:04,780 --> 01:02:07,080
What the hell is with this world?

1756
01:02:07,710 --> 01:02:08,980
Yeah, I know...

1757
01:02:09,280 --> 01:02:10,010
It is so weird though, right?

1758
01:02:09,380 --> 01:02:11,710
It's so weird!

1759
01:02:10,410 --> 01:02:11,010
It definitely is strange...

1760
01:02:11,380 --> 01:02:12,580
This world they've created  is bizarre!

1761
01:02:12,580 --> 01:02:15,280
This world they've created is so weird

1762
01:02:16,210 --> 01:02:18,050
And the Osaka-ben (Kansai dialect) is a bit off too!!

1763
01:02:18,310 --> 01:02:19,510
When old man Tanaka

1764
01:02:19,750 --> 01:02:22,510
dug where Shiro told him to...

1765
01:02:22,550 --> 01:02:33,150
Protein

1766
01:02:22,550 --> 01:02:33,150
Protein

1767
01:02:22,550 --> 01:02:33,150
Protein

1768
01:02:22,550 --> 01:02:33,150
Protein

1769
01:02:22,550 --> 01:02:33,150
Protein

1770
01:02:23,350 --> 01:02:26,110
My god, what is this? It's protein!

1771
01:02:26,650 --> 01:02:27,850
I'm speechless!

1772
01:02:28,810 --> 01:02:32,410
From the ground, a hell of a lot of protein came out!

1773
01:02:33,250 --> 01:02:36,310
Old man Matsumoto, who was watching all of this said...

1774
01:02:36,910 --> 01:02:38,510
Oh man, that's so awesome

1775
01:02:38,650 --> 01:02:40,210
If I had that much protein...

1776
01:02:40,450 --> 01:02:42,810
how much would I bulk up?

1777
01:02:44,350 --> 01:02:46,750
Naturally being addicted to muscles

1778
01:02:47,150 --> 01:02:49,450
and moaning that he will not drink water unless it's at room temperature

1779
01:02:49,750 --> 01:02:52,010
and just generally acting like a super model

1780
01:02:52,050 --> 01:02:57,010
old man Matsumoto was just so jealous of the protein, he couldn't control himself.

1781
01:02:59,910 --> 01:03:00,750
So that night...

1782
01:03:05,050 --> 01:03:06,180
Shit, shit, shit

1783
01:03:05,880 --> 01:03:07,710
Doesn't this just piss you off?

1784
01:03:07,180 --> 01:03:08,080
Shit, shit, shit

1785
01:03:07,710 --> 01:03:10,010
Doesn't this just really piss you off?

1786
01:03:10,710 --> 01:03:11,450
This is really funny.

1787
01:03:15,750 --> 01:03:16,910
Doesn't this piss you off?

1788
01:03:15,910 --> 01:03:16,610
This is bad...

1789
01:03:17,050 --> 01:03:17,810
Shit, shit, shit

1790
01:03:18,050 --> 01:03:19,310
This world is really bad

1791
01:03:18,850 --> 01:03:20,710
That mask is a no-no

1792
01:03:21,480 --> 01:03:22,950
like talking about water  being at room temperature and stuff

1793
01:03:22,950 --> 01:03:24,810
like talking about water being at room temperature  and stuff

1794
01:03:25,350 --> 01:03:27,080
memos about what you like

1795
01:03:28,180 --> 01:03:30,680
So that night, wearing a large mask

1796
01:03:31,080 --> 01:03:32,480
and a black cap

1797
01:03:33,050 --> 01:03:35,680
He sneaks into Tanaka's house

1798
01:03:33,950 --> 01:03:35,150
The mask suits him

1799
01:03:35,150 --> 01:03:35,650
shit...

1800
01:03:36,050 --> 01:03:37,950
He kidnapped Shiro the dog

1801
01:03:38,650 --> 01:03:40,380
And the next day...

1802
01:03:41,150 --> 01:03:45,110
Oi, you bloody dog. Where do I need to dig to get me some protein!?

1803
01:03:48,310 --> 01:03:50,810
Here huh? There, there...

1804
01:03:50,950 --> 01:03:53,850
Now I can become a real machine too!

1805
01:03:54,610 --> 01:03:56,910
Hang on, nothing is coming out!

1806
01:03:57,380 --> 01:04:00,210
You bloody dog, you tricked me, huh?!

1807
01:04:01,310 --> 01:04:04,610
Old man Matsumoto got so cross that nothing came out

1808
01:04:05,080 --> 01:04:08,180
that he tied Shiro to the tree and left him there...

1809
01:04:08,780 --> 01:04:11,980
Shiro! Shiro-han, where are ya!?

1810
01:04:13,780 --> 01:04:17,480
Shiro, what happened? You poor thing!

1811
01:04:18,180 --> 01:04:22,580
When old man Tanaka untied Shiro from the tree...

1812
01:04:22,910 --> 01:04:23,710
Shiro suddenly...

1813
01:04:25,910 --> 01:04:27,780
What's wrong bud?

1814
01:04:29,480 --> 01:04:31,710
Is there something over there?

1815
01:04:32,180 --> 01:04:37,210
Old man Tanaka was lead into the forest by Shiro.

1816
01:04:37,410 --> 01:04:38,110
When suddenly...

1817
01:04:38,710 --> 01:04:40,480
Wow, holy shit, what is this?!

1818
01:04:40,710 --> 01:04:42,480
What a huge castle!

1819
01:04:43,480 --> 01:04:45,880
When out of nowhere, a beautiful castle he had never seen before

1820
01:04:46,080 --> 01:04:48,410
appeared before him.

1821
01:04:49,480 --> 01:04:52,680
This was a castle which was full of dogs

1822
01:04:53,080 --> 01:04:55,910
and because Tanaka saved Shiro,

1823
01:04:56,380 --> 01:04:59,010
he was treated to great food whilst being entertained by dancers and music

1824
01:04:59,380 --> 01:05:01,210
and he received great hospitality here

1825
01:05:02,680 --> 01:05:04,210
Haha, this is so fun!

1826
01:05:07,380 --> 01:05:10,610
And, when old man Tanaka was about to go home...

1827
01:05:11,110 --> 01:05:14,280
the dog looking after him brought two wicker baskets.

1828
01:05:15,010 --> 01:05:17,580
As a souvenir, we present you with a big wicker basket

1829
01:05:17,580 --> 01:05:20,210
and a small wicker basket.

1830
01:05:20,880 --> 01:05:23,710
However, you can only open one of these wicker baskets.

1831
01:05:24,510 --> 01:05:27,880
No matter what, you may not open both wicker baskets.

1832
01:05:30,010 --> 01:05:32,180
And old man Tanaka, who was told this

1833
01:05:32,780 --> 01:05:34,780
cleverly using his chin

1834
01:05:35,080 --> 01:05:37,680
took home with him the two wicker baskets.

1835
01:05:38,480 --> 01:05:40,310
Hey, old man Tanaka.

1836
01:05:40,410 --> 01:05:43,210
You have some awesome wicker baskets there.

1837
01:05:43,210 --> 01:05:45,380
Give me one of them!

1838
01:05:45,680 --> 01:05:47,810
No, this is a precious souvenir of mine.

1839
01:05:48,280 --> 01:05:50,980
However much you beg me for it, I can't give you this.

1840
01:05:51,480 --> 01:05:54,410
Oh just shut the hell up, I'm taking the bigger one!

1841
01:05:54,580 --> 01:05:55,380
You're such a bad person!

1842
01:05:55,580 --> 01:06:00,380
Unbelievably, old man Matsumoto didn't even listen to old man Tanaka's story,

1843
01:06:00,880 --> 01:06:03,080
and just took the bigger wicker basket

1844
01:06:03,680 --> 01:06:05,780
and went back to his house.

1845
01:06:06,310 --> 01:06:08,710
Could there be a life time supply of protein

1846
01:06:08,710 --> 01:06:11,110
in here?

1847
01:06:12,010 --> 01:06:13,610
I can't wait anymore!

1848
01:06:14,380 --> 01:06:17,110
And so old man Matsumoto went to

1849
01:06:17,110 --> 01:06:19,480
open the big wicker basket...

1850
01:06:20,080 --> 01:06:21,380
Unbelievably, out of the wicker basket

1851
01:06:21,380 --> 01:06:26,210
came out monsters we could not imagine from this world

1852
01:06:27,780 --> 01:06:30,480
This is not good, this is really not good!

1853
01:06:30,680 --> 01:06:33,480
Eventually, old man Matsumoto

1854
01:06:33,480 --> 01:06:36,210
was dragged down into hell.

1855
01:06:36,280 --> 01:06:38,280
HELP MEEEEE

1856
01:06:39,110 --> 01:06:40,180
Meanwhile

1857
01:06:40,680 --> 01:06:45,110
when old man Tanaka opened his smaller wicker basket...

1858
01:06:45,480 --> 01:06:48,110
What, what is this?!

1859
01:06:48,980 --> 01:06:52,780
Unbelievably, inside the wicker basket, was a Thai Kick boxer!

1860
01:06:53,610 --> 01:06:56,380
The Thai Kick boxer jumped out of the wicker basket

1861
01:06:56,910 --> 01:07:00,910
and kicked old man Tanaka's arse as hard as he could!

1862
01:07:02,180 --> 01:07:03,180
THE END

1863
01:07:08,310 --> 01:07:09,810
This is absolutely ridiculous!

1864
01:07:09,950 --> 01:07:15,750
Punished for opening the second wicker basket

1865
01:07:09,950 --> 01:07:15,750
m 6 0 l 1335 0 b 1335 0 1335 1.5 1335 12 l 1335 12 b 1335 35.875 1335 149.75 1335 149.75 l 4.5 149.75 b 0 149.75 0 73.375 0 12 b 0 1.5 0 0 6 0

1866
01:07:10,350 --> 01:07:11,110
That is amazing

1867
01:07:11,710 --> 01:07:12,710
That is brutal

1868
01:07:12,810 --> 01:07:14,410
No no, this is just absolutely ridiculous!

1869
01:07:14,610 --> 01:07:15,250
This bloody story.

1870
01:07:15,910 --> 01:07:16,910
Well there is no escape...

1871
01:07:18,350 --> 01:07:19,650
is there...

1872
01:07:20,350 --> 01:07:20,950
It was inside (the basket)...

1873
01:07:20,980 --> 01:07:22,910
You opened it...

1874
01:07:22,910 --> 01:07:25,810
Is it possible for both to contain bad things?

1875
01:07:25,280 --> 01:07:27,710
It's because old man Matsumoto opened the other one...

1876
01:07:27,250 --> 01:07:28,980
Hang on a minute...

1877
01:07:28,280 --> 01:07:29,680
Hurry up

1878
01:07:28,980 --> 01:07:29,550
No I don't want to

1879
01:07:29,550 --> 01:07:31,080
I don't want to

1880
01:07:30,380 --> 01:07:31,780
Hurry up and get it over with

1881
01:07:31,950 --> 01:07:33,350
Every bloody year, I'm sick of it

1882
01:07:33,350 --> 01:07:34,750
Hurry up and stand up!

1883
01:07:34,180 --> 01:07:34,780
Just get ready...

1884
01:07:34,750 --> 01:07:36,480
Stand up you piece of shit...

1885
01:07:35,850 --> 01:07:37,050
First things first, stand...

1886
01:07:37,450 --> 01:07:38,450
There's no point doing that

1887
01:07:38,180 --> 01:07:40,150
There is nothing we can do about this...

1888
01:07:40,150 --> 01:07:40,750
No point..

1889
01:07:40,780 --> 01:07:43,180
Stand up!

1890
01:07:41,980 --> 01:07:43,080
Get ready for it anyway...

1891
01:07:42,210 --> 01:07:43,780
I do understand how you feel...

1892
01:07:46,050 --> 01:07:49,310
There are  unnecessary options  with this situation

1893
01:07:47,480 --> 01:07:48,210
Just before he's going to get kicked...

1894
01:07:48,280 --> 01:07:48,980
There are other options too...

1895
01:07:48,910 --> 01:07:49,910
What an unnecessary option...

1896
01:07:51,180 --> 01:07:51,910
Please, wait a minute...

1897
01:07:52,180 --> 01:07:54,010
It's going to happen eventually so...

1898
01:07:52,280 --> 01:07:52,710
Isn't this... strange?

1899
01:07:53,250 --> 01:07:55,250
Isn't this just really strange?

1900
01:07:55,250 --> 01:07:56,150
I do understand how you feel...

1901
01:07:55,510 --> 01:07:57,480
You have to stand still!

1902
01:07:56,680 --> 01:07:57,510
Please wait a minute!

1903
01:07:57,310 --> 01:07:58,010
It's dangerous, man!

1904
01:07:58,010 --> 01:07:59,080
No, wait, wait, please.

1905
01:07:58,780 --> 01:08:00,750
It won't hurt as much this year

1906
01:08:00,250 --> 01:08:01,050
Yeah, he's right.

1907
01:08:01,050 --> 01:08:02,250
It's every bloody year...

1908
01:08:02,780 --> 01:08:03,610
I know...

1909
01:08:03,610 --> 01:08:04,580
Hurry up, he's not sure what to do!

1910
01:08:04,580 --> 01:08:07,180
Hurry up, he's not sure what to do!

1911
01:08:06,150 --> 01:08:08,550
I will, but isn't this just really strange?

1912
01:08:08,950 --> 01:08:10,080
See, that's your other option...

1913
01:08:09,180 --> 01:08:11,280
There's your other option right there.

1914
01:08:12,080 --> 01:08:13,080
There's no point, right?

1915
01:08:13,050 --> 01:08:15,710
It hurts so much...

1916
01:08:14,650 --> 01:08:15,750
The second one was a beautiful connection...

1917
01:08:15,880 --> 01:08:16,950
It really hurt... ARGH!

1918
01:08:18,050 --> 01:08:19,250
It really hurt... ARGH!

1919
01:08:21,050 --> 01:08:22,780
UGGGAAAAA!!

1920
01:08:23,050 --> 01:08:24,350
good job...

1921
01:08:24,510 --> 01:08:28,380
I'm sorry he took so long to get ready...

1922
01:08:31,880 --> 01:08:32,650
This hurts so much...

1923
01:08:33,450 --> 01:08:34,350
Yeah it really does...

1924
01:08:33,810 --> 01:08:35,380
It hurts...

1925
01:08:35,380 --> 01:08:36,280
It hurts

1926
01:08:36,280 --> 01:08:37,410
It hurts

1927
01:08:37,410 --> 01:08:38,010
It hurts so bad

1928
01:08:38,010 --> 01:08:38,450
It hurts so so bad!

1929
01:08:38,450 --> 01:08:39,910
It hurts so bad

1930
01:08:39,910 --> 01:08:41,010
So bad...

1931
01:08:45,580 --> 01:08:48,010
My chinko hurts so bad

1932
01:08:48,410 --> 01:08:50,580
You can't say that...

1933
01:08:53,710 --> 01:08:55,210
For crying out loud Tanaka...

1934
01:08:55,310 --> 01:08:55,910
My chinko hurts...

1935
01:08:56,150 --> 01:08:57,210

My chinko hurts so bad...

1937
01:08:56,850 --> 01:08:57,910
What's wrong with you?

1938
01:08:58,150 --> 01:08:59,780
How did it hurt your chinko?

1939
01:09:00,010 --> 01:09:00,780
Why... how?

1940
01:09:00,710 --> 01:09:01,880
My chinko hurts so bad...

1941
01:09:03,750 --> 01:09:07,350
Tanaka, you're not the kind of person who says things like that, right?

1942
01:09:05,650 --> 01:09:07,450
Yeah, you're not!

1943
01:09:07,350 --> 01:09:08,410
Stop it this instant, Tanaka.

1944
01:09:08,610 --> 01:09:12,710
Where does it hurt?

1945
01:09:09,680 --> 01:09:12,710
My chinko...

1946
01:09:10,580 --> 01:09:11,480

01:11:39,610 --> 01:11:43,350
While I was eating at a Chinese food restaurant

2022
01:11:43,610 --> 01:11:47,650
There was a Chinese waitress

2023
01:11:47,650 --> 01:11:51,650
She was fighting with the cook in the kitchen in Chinese

2024
01:11:51,650 --> 01:11:55,710
Could it possibly be~ Could it possibly be~

2025
01:11:55,710 --> 01:11:59,910
That she fell in love with me and told him she wanted to change her nationality?

2026
01:12:02,310 --> 01:12:05,910
Could it possibly be~ Could it possibly be~

2027
01:12:03,950 --> 01:12:09,680
Dobu Rock's Eguchi
Azuma Mikihisa

2028
01:12:06,050 --> 01:12:10,350
That she is hitting on me~

2029
01:12:09,850 --> 01:12:23,680
※Even if they laughed, we are continuing on, so please watch.

2030
01:12:12,280 --> 01:12:16,080
When I was walking in my hometown, Shibuya

2031
01:12:16,380 --> 01:12:20,180
A gal came out of 109 department store

2032
01:12:20,180 --> 01:12:24,350
She suddenly passed out and caused a ruckus

2033
01:12:24,350 --> 01:12:28,250
Could it possibly be~ Could it possibly be~

2034
01:12:28,250 --> 01:12:32,450
Does this mean she wants me to do some french kissing CPR to her?

2035
01:12:31,950 --> 01:12:33,810
Is he an idiot!?

2036
01:12:32,450 --> 01:12:33,810
What the hell is "French kiss CPR"!!

2037
01:12:34,650 --> 01:12:38,510
Could it really be~ Could it maybe~

2038
01:12:37,710 --> 01:12:42,410
Dobu Rock's Eguchi
Gushiken Yoko

2039
01:12:38,510 --> 01:12:43,010
That she is hitting on me~

2040
01:12:45,110 --> 01:12:49,380
After 12 rounds of boxing

2041
01:12:49,380 --> 01:12:53,410
She said my stamina as a boxer is so amazing

2042
01:12:53,410 --> 01:12:57,410
Could it really be~ Could it maybe~

2043
01:12:54,510 --> 01:12:56,480
That's wrong!!

2044
01:12:54,510 --> 01:12:56,480
That's wrong!!

2045
01:12:56,550 --> 01:12:58,910
Even your tempo is wrong!!

2046
01:12:56,550 --> 01:12:58,910
Even your tempo is wrong!!

2047
01:12:58,810 --> 01:13:01,080
Could it possibly be~

2048
01:13:02,050 --> 01:13:05,750
Do you want to fight the 13th round with me?

2049
01:13:06,780 --> 01:13:08,950
He changed most of the song.

2050
01:13:09,150 --> 01:13:10,350
Hey!

2051
01:13:10,450 --> 01:13:11,880
You're not suppose to shout "Hey!".

2052
01:13:12,680 --> 01:13:16,650
Could it possibly be~ Could it possibly be~

2053
01:13:16,150 --> 01:13:20,350
Dobu Rock's Eguchi
Mori Kumiko

2054
01:13:16,650 --> 01:13:21,150
That they are hitting on me~

2055
01:13:23,080 --> 01:13:27,380
I went to a restaurant in Nishiazabu

2056
01:13:27,380 --> 01:13:31,280
I ordered wine for drinking

2057
01:13:31,280 --> 01:13:35,150
When I was asked "Red or white?"

2058
01:13:35,150 --> 01:13:39,080
Could it possibly be~ Could it possibly be~

2059
01:13:39,080 --> 01:13:43,480
Does this mean you want to check the color of my panties?

2060
01:13:47,080 --> 01:13:50,980
Could it possibly be~ Could it possibly be~

2061
01:13:50,650 --> 01:13:56,010
Dobu Rock's Eguchi
Umemiya Tatsuo

2062
01:13:53,010 --> 01:13:57,010
That she is rolling over for me~

2063
01:13:56,010 --> 01:13:58,410
He can't even say it...

2064
01:13:58,410 --> 01:14:02,450
I was fishing in the sea

2065
01:14:02,950 --> 01:14:06,910
A young girl was fishing beside me

2066
01:14:07,110 --> 01:14:11,050
She got stung by a bee and panicked

2067
01:14:11,310 --> 01:14:15,510
Could it possibly be~ Could it possibly be~

2068
01:14:15,510 --> 01:14:20,250
Does she want me to urinate onto her as first aid treatment?

2069
01:14:22,210 --> 01:14:30,550
All the popular celebrities seem to be successful

2070
01:14:30,550 --> 01:14:34,650
But a certain researcher told us

2071
01:14:34,650 --> 01:14:38,410
Most of the celebrities are just a bunch of PERVERTS~

2072
01:14:38,410 --> 01:14:40,410
Yeah~ Yeah~ Yeah yeah~

2073
01:14:40,710 --> 01:14:44,710
Could it possibly be~ Could it possibly be~

2074
01:14:44,710 --> 01:14:47,010
Could it possibly be~

2075
01:14:46,680 --> 01:14:50,080
Gushiken-san was so bad.

2076
01:14:50,280 --> 01:14:51,480
His was really bad.

2077
01:14:51,180 --> 01:14:53,080
He couldn't say it.

2078
01:14:52,480 --> 01:14:55,780
Even that "Could it possibly be" is wrong.

2079
01:14:53,450 --> 01:14:56,650
He couldn't say it even once!!

2080
01:15:00,650 --> 01:15:02,480
That was a really good song to listen to.

2081
01:15:02,480 --> 01:15:04,980
When you go through bad times, remember that song and try your best!!

2082
01:15:05,650 --> 01:15:11,380
Training program (2)
Hypnotherapy to purify the prisoner's heart

2083
01:15:05,880 --> 01:15:11,350
And now they will participate in a hypnotherapy session to purify their hearts.

2084
01:15:11,710 --> 01:15:17,180
It will be done by a world famous hypnotist called Mitchel.

2085
01:15:11,910 --> 01:15:17,880
Mitchel can hypnotize anyone!!

2086
01:15:11,910 --> 01:15:17,880
Very famous hypnotist

2087
01:15:18,310 --> 01:15:20,710
Mitchel-san, who will you hypnotize?

2088
01:15:23,380 --> 01:15:25,610
Then, the four of you.

2089
01:15:25,910 --> 01:15:27,580
Please come to the front.

2090
01:15:26,650 --> 01:15:32,110
The 4 people are called to be hypnotized

2091
01:15:33,310 --> 01:15:38,410
Mitchel-san wants to hypnotize you as well.

2092
01:15:37,950 --> 01:15:41,850
Being called out to be hypnotized by Mitchel

2093
01:15:39,510 --> 01:15:40,450
Please come forward.

2094
01:15:42,710 --> 01:15:43,650
Do your best!!

2095
01:15:43,350 --> 01:15:44,750
This is the start of a disaster.

2096
01:15:44,210 --> 01:15:46,550
It really is.

2097
01:15:46,610 --> 01:15:48,210
I think we laughed so much at this.

2098
01:15:47,150 --> 01:15:48,750
This is hell!!

2099
01:15:52,180 --> 01:15:53,480
I think this will be hard.

2100
01:15:54,580 --> 01:15:55,880
It really is.

2101
01:15:55,880 --> 01:15:57,350
Please relax.

2102
01:16:00,250 --> 01:16:03,050
Your consciousness is mine.

2103
01:16:06,250 --> 01:16:07,550
Are they hypnotized?

2104
01:16:08,150 --> 01:16:09,150
They are?

2105
01:16:09,750 --> 01:16:11,350
They are all completely hypnotized.

2106
01:16:09,950 --> 01:16:15,450
Endo is now hypnotized

2107
01:16:12,650 --> 01:16:15,880
Now I will touch 3 people's shoulders.

2108
01:16:16,080 --> 01:16:18,250
When I touch you,

2109
01:16:18,350 --> 01:16:19,850
You will be a tyrannosaurus.

2110
01:16:19,850 --> 01:16:22,580
The 2nd person I touch will be Stegosaurus.

2111
01:16:22,580 --> 01:16:26,050
The 3rd person will be a Pteranodon.

2112
01:16:27,150 --> 01:16:28,850
Tyrannosaurus.

2113
01:16:30,350 --> 01:16:32,150
Stegosaurus.

2114
01:16:34,850 --> 01:16:36,280
And you're Pteranodon.

2115
01:16:42,550 --> 01:16:44,480
GOoooo~!!

2116
01:16:45,450 --> 01:16:48,380
OGO! OGO! OGO! OGO! OGO! OGO!

2117
01:17:06,310 --> 01:17:08,650
What the hell is he even saying?

2118
01:17:15,950 --> 01:17:17,710
Do they actually go "OGO OGO OGO" like that?

2119
01:17:19,210 --> 01:17:21,250
How do you feel to be hypnotized?

2120
01:17:21,550 --> 01:17:22,750
Was I really hypnotized?

2121
01:17:22,250 --> 01:17:24,750
Yes, you were.

2122
01:17:24,750 --> 01:17:27,350
My body feels really hot when I was under...

2123
01:17:29,810 --> 01:17:32,410
1:30 PM.

2124
01:17:32,710 --> 01:17:36,410
The five prisoners are talking about hypnosis.

2125
01:17:36,710 --> 01:17:38,210
But that was good, right?

2126
01:17:38,850 --> 01:17:40,450
OGO!! OGO!! OGO!!

2127
01:17:40,450 --> 01:17:42,680
OGO!! OGO!! OGO!!

2128
01:17:43,250 --> 01:17:45,180
OGO!! OGO!! OGO!!

2129
01:17:48,450 --> 01:17:49,850
Even his hands were like this.

2130
01:17:49,810 --> 01:17:59,480
Endo's Pteranodon

2131
01:17:50,710 --> 01:17:52,780
It was really amazing.

2132
01:17:56,410 --> 01:17:58,210
That was embarrassing!

2133
01:17:57,510 --> 01:17:59,610
But you did it!

2134
01:17:59,610 --> 01:18:01,280
I don't remember it at all.

2135
01:18:01,280 --> 01:18:05,080
Yeahhh, serves you right!

2136
01:18:04,510 --> 01:18:07,210
Because you were laughing when we're not suppose to laugh!!

2137
01:18:06,650 --> 01:18:08,350
You're right, I laughed.

2138
01:18:08,550 --> 01:18:09,910
Sorry, sorry.

2139
01:18:09,080 --> 01:18:11,050
That was amazing.

2140
01:18:11,050 --> 01:18:12,580
Well, yeah.

2141
01:18:12,650 --> 01:18:14,280
That was the most brutal yet.

2142
01:18:14,650 --> 01:18:15,680
The Pteranodon?

2143
01:18:15,450 --> 01:18:16,150
Yeah.

2144
01:18:15,850 --> 01:18:18,480
I think they're amazing.

2145
01:18:18,680 --> 01:18:21,550
They still went extinct even though they were strong.

2146
01:18:20,680 --> 01:18:22,350
They were really strong.

2147
01:18:22,450 --> 01:18:24,050
OGO!! OGO!! OGO!!

2148
01:18:24,050 --> 01:18:26,050
OGO!! OGO!! OGO!!

2149
01:18:31,180 --> 01:18:32,580
Did you laugh?

2150
01:18:33,350 --> 01:18:36,180
That was a nice hit!

2151
01:18:36,180 --> 01:18:38,350
Because you laughed!

2152
01:18:36,180 --> 01:18:38,350
That was gorgeous.

2153
01:18:39,250 --> 01:18:40,750

Life in prison is unexpectedly occupied.

2157
01:18:50,750 --> 01:18:52,480
Uwah, it's a gymnasium.

They are going to participate in a recreational competition with a rival prison.

2161
01:18:58,110 --> 01:19:00,150
This kind of setting, huh.

2162
01:19:00,150 --> 01:19:03,750
Becuase it's recreational from now on, it's okay to laugh.

2163
01:19:03,350 --> 01:19:08,610
Special rule
During recreation time it's OK to laugh!!

2164
01:19:03,750 --> 01:19:07,010

01:36:06,810 --> 01:36:08,050
You’re just barely OK.

2751
01:36:08,050 --> 01:36:10,050
Barely OK.

2752
01:36:09,550 --> 01:36:15,410

2754
01:36:12,610 --> 01:36:14,310
Matsumoto, it’s not over until it’s over.

2755
01:36:14,310 --> 01:36:15,610

01:36:48,410 --> 01:36:49,610
Shochu was already said?

2783
01:36:49,050 --> 01:36:52,050
✕

2784
01:36:50,350 --> 01:36:51,650
Matsumoto!

2785
01:36:52,250 --> 01:36:53,210
Yes!

2786
01:36:52,950 --> 01:36:55,350
So, condolences to you.

2787
01:36:53,650 --> 01:36:55,150
Uh oh, the Monmari!

2788
01:36:55,350 --> 01:36:57,710
Mimata’s Monmari, start!

2789
01:36:57,310 --> 01:36:59,010
Monmari

2790
01:37:09,280 --> 01:37:11,650
It’s long!!

2791
01:37:13,250 --> 01:37:15,350
Sorry.  Really sorry.

2792
01:37:15,250 --> 01:37:16,850
Um...

2793
01:37:16,980 --> 01:37:18,050
Sorry.

2794
01:37:17,310 --> 01:37:20,650
It just smells like poop.

2795
01:37:22,080 --> 01:37:23,810
The end!!

2796
01:37:27,280 --> 01:37:28,410
Mimata's poop would be the worst.

2797
01:37:28,410 --> 01:37:29,880
Mimata's poop would be the worst.

2798
01:37:29,910 --> 01:37:30,350
It goes human ➡ gorilla ➡ dog ➡ Mimata

2799
01:37:30,350 --> 01:37:30,950
It goes human ➡ gorilla ➡ dog ➡ Mimata

2800
01:37:30,950 --> 01:37:31,410
It goes human ➡ gorilla ➡ dog ➡ Mimata

2801
01:37:31,410 --> 01:37:33,550
It goes human ➡ gorilla ➡ dog ➡ Mimata

2802
01:37:34,710 --> 01:37:36,410
2PM.

2803

Prison Life   5 Hours and 30 Minutes

2804
01:37:36,410 --> 01:37:39,010
There is no rest for the five.

2805
01:37:41,710 --> 01:37:43,580
That’s right.

2806
01:37:43,580 --> 01:37:46,810
There's a possibility there are new things

2807
01:37:45,180 --> 01:37:46,810
in here...

2808
01:37:46,580 --> 01:37:48,480
Yes, since we were out for a while.

2809
01:37:55,280 --> 01:37:56,350
OK, everyone.

2810
01:37:56,350 --> 01:37:58,380
There’s nothing OK here!!

2811
01:37:57,410 --> 01:37:59,310
Now, uhh,

2812
01:37:59,350 --> 01:38:02,510
Gaasuu Kurobikari Central Prison has

2813
01:38:02,510 --> 01:38:04,510
a surveillance system that can prevent any prison escape.

2814
01:38:04,510 --> 01:38:05,650
a surveillance system that can prevent any prison escape.

2815
01:38:05,650 --> 01:38:07,910
We're going to go to an experiment of our super-advanced surveillance system.

2816
01:38:07,910 --> 01:38:11,150
We're going to go to an experiment of our super-advanced surveillance system.

2817
01:38:11,150 --> 01:38:12,250
We're going to have you be guinea pigs  for

2818
01:38:12,250 --> 01:38:17,050
We're going to have you be guinea pigs  for

2819
01:38:14,180 --> 01:38:17,050
the experiment.

2820
01:38:15,080 --> 01:38:16,850
What the hell is that?

2821
01:38:17,050 --> 01:38:18,880
Who says it so clearly like that?

2822
01:38:18,680 --> 01:38:19,680
Then, now...

2823
01:38:19,480 --> 01:38:20,480
Let’s go.

2824
01:38:20,080 --> 01:38:20,980
OK, let’s go.

2825
01:38:20,950 --> 01:38:30,280
Cutting Edge Security System

2826
01:38:20,950 --> 01:38:30,280
On to the Experiment Location

2827
01:38:20,980 --> 01:38:22,550
Guinea pigs?

2828
01:38:22,550 --> 01:38:24,550
He says so clearly that we’re guinea pigs.

2829
01:38:24,550 --> 01:38:27,080
"We're going to have you be guinea pigs"?

2830
01:38:27,350 --> 01:38:28,550
He says so clearly that we're guinea pigs.

2831
01:38:28,280 --> 01:38:29,880
Who would want to go to that?

2832
01:38:29,580 --> 01:38:30,280
Absolutely.

2833
01:38:30,980 --> 01:38:32,780
Can everyone get on board?

2834
01:38:33,880 --> 01:38:36,150
They board the bus to be transported.

2835
01:38:37,450 --> 01:38:39,150
Of course, the way there

2836
01:38:39,980 --> 01:38:41,880
will not be smooth.

2837
01:38:43,050 --> 01:38:45,880
What lies in wait for them beyond?

2838
01:38:43,080 --> 01:38:49,850
The Curtain Rises on a New Act

2839
01:38:43,080 --> 01:38:49,850
What Lies in Wait for them Beyond?

2840
01:38:46,350 --> 01:38:49,550
The curtain rises on a new act.

2841
01:38:52,150 --> 01:38:54,050
The five ride a bus

2842
01:38:52,850 --> 01:38:56,750
Prison Life    5 Hours and 30 Minutes

2843
01:38:54,050 --> 01:38:56,550
that takes them to the prison’s experiment location.

2844
01:38:57,210 --> 01:38:59,410
Where is this going?

2845
01:38:59,810 --> 01:39:02,350
The experiment location.

2846
01:39:02,510 --> 01:39:04,010
The guinea pig thing, right?

2847
01:39:04,880 --> 01:39:06,410
Oh, the guinea pig thing.

2848
01:39:06,410 --> 01:39:08,880
Geez.

2849
01:39:08,310 --> 01:39:10,480
They have things like that even in this day and age?

2850
01:39:11,010 --> 01:39:12,980
The human rights here are completely messed up.

2851
01:39:13,210 --> 01:39:15,280
The human rights here are completely messed up.

2852
01:39:16,010 --> 01:39:17,780
You’re gonna say that again?  What Matsumoto said?

2853
01:39:17,480 --> 01:39:18,910
I already said that.

2854
01:39:18,710 --> 01:39:21,080
Well, I just wanted to once more, since I thought so, too.

2855
01:39:21,280 --> 01:39:22,680
The rights of people are just…

2856
01:39:23,680 --> 01:39:24,980
You’re just changing it.

2857
01:39:26,210 --> 01:39:29,450
You're just trying to say it with more words.

2858
01:39:31,180 --> 01:39:32,950
Pahahaha

2859
01:39:35,880 --> 01:39:37,880
Endo, why are you looking at me like that?

2860
01:39:37,450 --> 01:39:39,950
Well, you were laughing.

2861
01:39:40,350 --> 01:39:41,750
I wasn’t laughing.

2862
01:39:41,710 --> 01:39:44,110
But you can’t do that.

2863
01:39:42,550 --> 01:39:44,110
You can’t just take what someone else said.

2864
01:39:44,110 --> 01:39:49,110
The bus arrives at a stop

2865
01:39:44,710 --> 01:39:46,750
I just wanted to say, "Yes, that’s true."

2866
01:39:47,510 --> 01:39:48,850
Go really hard.

2867
01:39:48,610 --> 01:39:49,710
You don’t need to go really hard.

2868
01:39:52,050 --> 01:39:53,610
That’s one of those where the sound wasn’t much but it hurt.

2869
01:39:54,010 --> 01:39:55,410
I can tell.

2870
01:39:55,150 --> 01:39:57,110
My ass, seriously…

2871
01:39:59,010 --> 01:40:00,410
We're stopped?

2872
01:40:00,350 --> 01:40:02,180
What?

2873
01:40:02,310 --> 01:40:04,650
Is something gonna to come?

2874
01:40:06,350 --> 01:40:07,610
Oh, yeah.

2875
01:40:08,580 --> 01:40:09,350
Hahaha

2876
01:40:09,450 --> 01:40:10,750
I don't get it...

2877
01:40:10,750 --> 01:40:12,210
Who is this supposed to be?

2878
01:40:17,010 --> 01:40:19,310
Climb up properly.

2879
01:40:18,350 --> 01:40:20,750
I was wondering who...

2880
01:40:19,080 --> 01:40:22,980
Jinnai Tomonori*

2881
01:40:19,080 --> 01:40:22,980
Yabuki Kaoru (Asano Atsuko)

2882
01:40:19,080 --> 01:40:25,980
*Note: Jinnai Tomonori is a comedian.  He is playing the character of Yabuki Kaoru from the 1991 drama TV show "101st Marriage Proposal."  The actress who played the character of Yabuki Kaori in the actual show is Asano Atsuko.

2883
01:40:26,510 --> 01:40:28,080
I couldn’t tell.

2884
01:40:29,080 --> 01:40:34,610
Could this be the 101st…

2885
01:40:38,980 --> 01:40:40,280
Come on.

2886
01:40:39,010 --> 01:40:40,480
You’re kidding me.

2887
01:40:41,350 --> 01:40:45,080
Hoshino Tatsurou (Himself)

2888
01:40:41,350 --> 01:40:45,080
Takeda Tetsuya*

2889
01:40:41,350 --> 01:40:49,780
*Note: Takeda Tetsuya is the actual actor who played the character of Hoshino Tatsurou in the 1991 drama "101st Marriage Proposal."  In the show, Hoshino is the male lead character and Yabuki is the female lead character.  They are doing a parody of a famous scene from the show.

2890
01:40:42,280 --> 01:40:43,750
Kaoru!

2891
01:40:44,850 --> 01:40:46,180
Seriously?

2892
01:40:46,480 --> 01:40:48,780
Come on.

2893
01:40:47,250 --> 01:40:49,480
No way, seriously?

2894
01:40:51,950 --> 01:40:53,350
Ow, my back.

2895
01:40:57,650 --> 01:40:59,350
This isn’t really the kind of place for this, but

2896
01:40:59,350 --> 01:41:00,880
will you...

2897
01:40:59,650 --> 01:41:00,880
Don’t!!

2898
01:41:01,080 --> 01:41:01,780
Kaoru.

2899
01:41:01,950 --> 01:41:04,450
Please don’t be around me.

2900
01:41:03,450 --> 01:41:04,250
But, but I...

2901
01:41:04,250 --> 01:41:05,650
But, but I...

2902
01:41:04,750 --> 01:41:06,250
I told you:

2903
01:41:05,780 --> 01:41:16,050
101st Marriage Proposal Story

2904
01:41:05,780 --> 01:41:16,050
Kaoru is scared of believing in and falling in love with another person

2905
01:41:05,980 --> 01:41:07,580
five years ago,

2906
01:41:08,150 --> 01:41:10,150
I was forsaken by a man to whom I was engaged to,

2907
01:41:10,650 --> 01:41:11,350
and so I swore I wouldn’t fall in love again.

2908
01:41:11,350 --> 01:41:12,980
and so I swore I wouldn’t fall in love again.

2909
01:41:13,280 --> 01:41:14,450
So please don’t be around me.

2910
01:41:14,450 --> 01:41:15,780
So please don’t be around me.

2911
01:41:16,650 --> 01:41:17,710
But that’s why, will you, will you marr—

2912
01:41:17,710 --> 01:41:18,550
But that’s why, will you, will you marr—

2913
01:41:18,550 --> 01:41:19,050
But that’s why, will you, will you marr—

2914
01:41:19,050 --> 01:41:21,510
But that’s why, will you, will you marr—

2915
01:41:19,150 --> 01:41:21,510
I’m scared!!

2916
01:41:21,510 --> 01:41:23,650
I’m still scared...

2917
01:41:25,950 --> 01:41:27,010
I'm afraid of the acting ability of that golf idiot.

2918
01:41:27,010 --> 01:41:28,710
I'm afraid of the acting ability of that golf idiot.

2919
01:41:32,180 --> 01:41:36,880
Even though it was great that he was chosen as the main actor in that "Bus Jack" movie,

2920
01:41:36,880 --> 01:41:39,780
The movie was so bad, it looked like a cheap theater play.

2921
01:41:39,780 --> 01:41:43,880
The movie was so bad, it looked like a cheap theater play.

2922
01:41:43,880 --> 01:41:46,710
I'm so scared of ham actors like him!

2923
01:41:46,710 --> 01:41:48,480
I...

2924
01:41:48,580 --> 01:41:50,210
I won't act in a shitty movie like him!!

2925
01:41:50,210 --> 01:41:52,710
I won't act in a shitty movie like him!!

2926
01:41:54,110 --> 01:41:57,410
Even if I only read the script roughly once,

2927
01:41:57,410 --> 01:42:02,480
I won't act in a sketchy movie like him!!
I'll somehow someway read the script twice!

2928
01:42:02,580 --> 01:42:07,480
Even though the movie is made into DVDs, generally that is good for sales...

2929
01:42:07,480 --> 01:42:10,410
But on Amazon's DVD popularity ranking list, he was ranked 40850th.

2930
01:42:10,410 --> 01:42:13,610
But on Amazon's DVD popularity ranking list, he was ranked 40850th.

2931
01:42:13,610 --> 01:42:17,010
The highest price you could buy his DVD is for only 31 yen.

2932
01:42:17,010 --> 01:42:19,680
The highest price you could buy his DVD is for only 31 yen.

2933
01:42:19,680 --> 01:42:26,310
I will not star in a shitty movie where you can buy the DVD but not have enough money to even buy water.

2934
01:42:26,310 --> 01:42:28,680
Because I like you...

2935
01:42:30,210 --> 01:42:33,980
That actually makes
me wanna see the movie...

2936
01:42:34,750 --> 01:42:37,050
So it ranked so low huh

2937
01:42:36,650 --> 01:42:38,250
Is that even true?

2938
01:42:37,950 --> 01:42:39,680
Around 40,000th...

2939
01:42:42,450 --> 01:42:44,550
This is shocking...

2940
01:42:43,850 --> 01:42:45,580
Tatsuro-san!!

2941
01:42:45,580 --> 01:42:48,350
You're willing to do that for me...

2942
01:42:48,350 --> 01:42:50,880
That's why I'm asking you to mar...

2943
01:42:49,180 --> 01:42:50,880
But I'm afraid!!

2944
01:42:50,880 --> 01:42:52,280
As I thought, I'm afraid...

2945
01:42:52,280 --> 01:42:56,680
I'm afraid of that tsukkomi gorilla's senility you know.

2946
01:42:57,680 --> 01:43:03,480
Every time before we start recording for a show, when he farts...

2947
01:43:03,480 --> 01:43:05,510
His shit completely leaks out.

2948
01:43:05,510 --> 01:43:10,980
I'm so scared of that depressed gorilla's senility!

2949
01:43:10,980 --> 01:43:13,380
Before a shooting, I won't shit myself like that!

2950
01:43:13,380 --> 01:43:15,310
Before a shooting, I won't shit myself like that!

2951
01:43:15,310 --> 01:43:17,350
Because I like you...

2952
01:43:16,710 --> 01:43:18,750
It was just
a little bit of shit.

2953
01:43:19,310 --> 01:43:20,910
I heard of another thing as well.

2954
01:43:20,910 --> 01:43:23,480
He called his junior, "Durians" over.

2955
01:43:23,480 --> 01:43:25,880
Even though his own show is in a competing slot with their show.

2956
01:43:25,880 --> 01:43:28,910
He was completely into a show that is on another channel.

2957
01:43:28,910 --> 01:43:32,080
He suddenly went and faced Durians earnestly.

2958
01:43:32,080 --> 01:43:35,210
It's good that young lads like you could make it.

2959
01:43:35,210 --> 01:43:38,480
His eyes got teary and said, "It's bright in here."

2960
01:43:38,480 --> 01:43:41,750
What is with that seriousness and sudden sighing state.

2961
01:43:41,750 --> 01:43:46,780
I won't be like that big lips gorilla!

2962
01:43:47,750 --> 01:43:50,080
That's embarrassing!!

2963
01:43:52,050 --> 01:43:53,650
Did you really say that?

2964
01:43:53,050 --> 01:43:54,750
That's embarrassing!!

2965
01:43:59,050 --> 01:44:01,150
But it was really bright.

2966
01:44:00,180 --> 01:44:04,180
You really said something amazing.

2967
01:44:01,950 --> 01:44:04,180
Tatsuro-san, you're willing to do that for me...

2968
01:44:04,450 --> 01:44:06,650
That's why...

2969
01:44:05,450 --> 01:44:06,650
BUT I'M AFRAID!!

2970
01:44:06,650 --> 01:44:08,180
As I thought, I'm still scared.

2971
01:44:08,580 --> 01:44:13,780
I'm scared of that funny muscular idiot.

2972
01:44:13,780 --> 01:44:18,080
When a certain disease was featured in a show...

2973
01:44:18,080 --> 01:44:21,650
Plus, recently his blood pressure was really high as well.

2974
01:44:21,650 --> 01:44:24,380
He was worried that he was infected by that disease.

2975
01:44:24,380 --> 01:44:26,950
With great excitement, he went to the hospital and the result was...

2976
01:44:26,950 --> 01:44:30,010
"You have too much muscle" was the reason.

2977
01:44:30,010 --> 01:44:33,550
I'm scared of the stoicism of that muscular idiot!

2978
01:44:33,550 --> 01:44:37,280
I won't build so much muscle and raise my blood pressure like that guy!

2979
01:44:37,280 --> 01:44:40,680
Because I like you!!

2980
01:44:41,080 --> 01:44:42,680
That's right..

2981
01:44:43,450 --> 01:44:48,880
Going to the gym and light jog for 30 mins to warm up his body, then moved on to another exercise.

2982
01:44:48,880 --> 01:44:51,650
And when his favorite equipment can't be used...

2983
01:44:51,650 --> 01:44:53,250
He gives up.

2984
01:44:53,250 --> 01:44:57,450
And went to another gym and jogs lightly for another 30 mins to warm up again.

2985
01:44:57,450 --> 01:45:02,010
I won't be like that muscular idiot!

2986
01:45:02,010 --> 01:45:06,110
When his junior asked him, "What is the number one thing you want right now?"

2987
01:45:06,110 --> 01:45:08,410
He answered earnestly, "I guess..."

2988
01:45:08,410 --> 01:45:11,250
"Probably to get just one large sum of money at once"

2989
01:45:11,250 --> 01:45:12,210
"Hmmm...?"

2990
01:45:12,210 --> 01:45:15,910
"The next thing that I want is more time I guess" was his answer!

2991
01:45:15,910 --> 01:45:19,780
I won't be like that Naniwa comedian!

2992
01:45:15,910 --> 01:45:19,780
TL Note: Naniwa is the old name of Osaka, so he's basically implying Matsumoto is old. I think.

2993
01:45:18,110 --> 01:45:19,780
Scary!

2994
01:45:19,780 --> 01:45:22,610
Because I like you...

2995
01:45:19,780 --> 01:45:22,610
Scary! He wants money...

2996
01:45:23,050 --> 01:45:25,350
I did say that

2997
01:45:26,250 --> 01:45:27,650
That's scary!

2998
01:45:27,650 --> 01:45:29,750
At least he admits it.

2999
01:45:29,050 --> 01:45:30,750
Amazing.

3000
01:45:31,150 --> 01:45:32,780
Please.

3001
01:45:36,880 --> 01:45:39,080
Tatsuro-san, you're willing to do that for me...

3002
01:45:38,750 --> 01:45:39,780
Yes.

3003
01:45:39,810 --> 01:45:41,780
That's right! That's why please let me say this one thing.

3004
01:45:41,780 --> 01:45:44,250
Please marry me...

3005
01:45:42,980 --> 01:45:44,250
BUT I'M SCARED!!

3006
01:45:44,250 --> 01:45:46,780
After all, I'm still afraid...

3007
01:45:46,780 --> 01:45:48,680
Someone who will fall dead at any time.

3008
01:45:48,680 --> 01:45:52,950
I can't marry you because I'm scared of 70-something-year-old grandpas.

3009
01:45:52,950 --> 01:45:55,580
He's badmouthing him

3010
01:45:55,950 --> 01:45:58,950
YOU IDIOT!!!

3011
01:46:02,980 --> 01:46:06,350
Why would you say that kind of thing?

3012
01:46:05,980 --> 01:46:07,250
Even though that is the case...

3013
01:46:13,780 --> 01:46:15,410
Tasuro-san... I'm so sorry.

3014
01:46:15,410 --> 01:46:17,610
Tasuro-san... I'm so sorry.

3015
01:46:18,550 --> 01:46:21,150
You're not getting off?

3016
01:46:21,150 --> 01:46:23,110
Are you not getting off?

3017
01:46:23,610 --> 01:46:25,010
Seriously?

3018
01:46:25,010 --> 01:46:27,850
I want this guy to get off too...

3019
01:46:28,110 --> 01:46:31,610
He looks like Sasaki Kojirou.

3020
01:46:31,610 --> 01:46:34,710
Really is Sasaki Kojirou.

3021
01:46:37,410 --> 01:46:39,510
Sasaki Kojirou lol

3022
01:46:40,280 --> 01:46:42,180
Uwaaa!!

3023
01:46:42,210 --> 01:46:44,080
Uwaaa!!

3024
01:46:44,380 --> 01:46:45,980
Uwaaa!!

3025
01:46:46,010 --> 01:46:49,580
Uwaaa!!

3026
01:46:49,580 --> 01:46:52,310
That famous scene once more...

3027
01:46:50,410 --> 01:46:52,580
Get out of the way, idiot!

3028
01:46:52,380 --> 01:46:55,610
I won't die!! I WON'T DIE!!

3029
01:46:55,910 --> 01:46:57,880
Because I like you!

3030
01:46:57,880 --> 01:47:01,680
I will make you happy!!

3031
01:47:01,680 --> 01:47:03,680
Tatsuro-san!!

3032
01:47:03,080 --> 01:47:05,080
They are doing this as scene as well...

3033
01:47:10,010 --> 01:47:12,380
That was so dangerous!!

3034
01:47:12,580 --> 01:47:14,510
It was a really famous scene

3035
01:47:13,580 --> 01:47:14,980
That's true.

3036
01:47:20,380 --> 01:47:22,310
Ah, that was surprising

3037
01:47:22,780 --> 01:47:30,480
A little bit more on the bus trip left
Prison's experimental center is before their own eyes

3038
01:47:22,780 --> 01:47:30,480
A little bit more on the bus trip left
Prison's experimental center is before their own eyes

3039
01:47:24,080 --> 01:47:27,480
There's only a little bit more on the bus trip.

3040
01:47:27,480 --> 01:47:30,880
The experimental center is approaching closer.

3041
01:47:31,080 --> 01:47:33,380
Fujiwara-san, come on...

3042
01:47:33,380 --> 01:47:35,980
Let's just get there without stopping.

3043
01:47:36,510 --> 01:47:39,580
We're about to arrive, guys.

3044
01:47:40,580 --> 01:47:45,680
Gaasuu Kurobikari Central Prison
Surveillance System Experimental Center

3045
01:47:49,080 --> 01:47:51,680
Uwaaah, is this for real?

3046
01:47:50,080 --> 01:47:52,180
The view is really nice.

3047
01:47:52,580 --> 01:47:55,280
Come on guys, we've reached our stop. Let's go.

3048
01:47:55,280 --> 01:47:57,680
You gotta be kidding me

3049
01:47:58,910 --> 01:48:00,180
You gotta be kidding me.

3050
01:47:59,510 --> 01:48:04,180
This is Gaasuu Kurobikari Central Prison's...

3051
01:48:02,880 --> 01:48:05,310
You can't run away at all.

3052
01:48:04,180 --> 01:48:07,010
This is our first Surveillance System Experimental Center.

3053
01:48:07,980 --> 01:48:10,210
There's a long and round track there.

3054
01:48:08,980 --> 01:48:10,810
I see it.

3055
01:48:10,410 --> 01:48:13,580
Uwah, that is huge.

3056
01:48:15,980 --> 01:48:17,080
There it is.

3057
01:48:16,180 --> 01:48:19,910
Experiment center's waiting room

3058
01:48:17,380 --> 01:48:21,080
Before your experiment, you have to change.

3059
01:48:20,880 --> 01:48:22,510
We have to exchange into this.

3060
01:48:22,580 --> 01:48:28,380
Before the surveillance experiment

3061
01:48:22,580 --> 01:48:28,380
Before the surveillance experiment

3062
01:48:22,580 --> 01:48:28,380
Change into clothes that is easy to move

3063
01:48:22,580 --> 01:48:28,380
Change into clothes that is easy to move

3064
01:48:23,180 --> 01:48:28,310
Before the experiment, they will change into clothes that doesn't restrict their movements.

3065
01:48:28,310 --> 01:48:31,410
In order to test to see if they can break out,

3066
01:48:28,780 --> 01:48:34,310
What is this latest surveillance system experiment?

3067
01:48:31,410 --> 01:48:34,510
they will be the subject of this new surveillance system.

3068
01:48:35,880 --> 01:48:37,380
Guys, are you ready?

3069
01:48:37,380 --> 01:48:41,280
Then, let me show you around what is this Surveillance Experiment is all about.

3070
01:48:41,280 --> 01:48:44,180
So, we're experiments, huh?

3071
01:48:44,380 --> 01:48:48,010
I feel like doing stretches in this occasion.

3072
01:48:46,680 --> 01:48:48,580
In the middle of an experiment.

3073
01:48:49,380 --> 01:48:50,180
SO WIDE!!

3074
01:48:50,450 --> 01:48:57,050
Exercise field

3075
01:48:55,250 --> 01:48:57,480
So huge.

3076
01:48:57,250 --> 01:48:59,450
This is bad.

3077
01:48:59,450 --> 01:49:01,250
This is...

3078
01:49:00,950 --> 01:49:03,050
Seriously...

3079
01:49:03,050 --> 01:49:04,480
Is this for real?

3080
01:49:05,980 --> 01:49:07,450
Okay, everyone.

3081
01:49:07,580 --> 01:49:10,180
This is the experiment that you will be doing!!

3082
01:49:13,280 --> 01:49:15,980
So, it's here. This year as well.

3083
01:49:16,350 --> 01:49:19,350
This place is too huge for this.

3084
01:49:20,310 --> 01:49:22,180
For now, it's okay to laugh but

3085
01:49:22,910 --> 01:49:25,210
During surveillance, oni will be around

3086
01:49:25,210 --> 01:49:28,910
When you're caught, you will get punished, okay?

3087
01:49:30,110 --> 01:49:32,010
You can't just punish someone when you caught them!!

3088
01:49:32,010 --> 01:49:36,210
Also, I thought just having you guys doing it would be too ugly so I called someone.

3089
01:49:36,210 --> 01:49:39,250
I called a really big star over. It's this person.

3090
01:49:46,050 --> 01:49:47,650
Really?

3091
01:49:47,650 --> 01:49:50,550
Him? Really?

3092
01:49:49,680 --> 01:49:54,410
Helper
Toshihiko Tahara

3093
01:49:49,680 --> 01:49:54,410
Helper
Toshihiko Tahara

3094
01:49:52,710 --> 01:49:54,380
I see.

3095
01:50:00,110 --> 01:50:02,380
How are youuu!!

3096
01:50:07,010 --> 01:50:09,480
Happy Merry Christmas!

3097
01:50:07,010 --> 01:50:09,480
[T/N: He is making a joke by instead of saying Hacchi (eight) he said Happy Merry Christmas. ]

3098
01:50:08,580 --> 01:50:10,810
What is he even saying.

3099
01:50:09,980 --> 01:50:11,810
And a Happy New Year!

3100
01:50:11,810 --> 01:50:15,080
You can bombed a joke this amazingly huh!

3101
01:50:14,210 --> 01:50:17,610
So loud. His voice echoed everywhere.

3102
01:50:16,410 --> 01:50:19,010
He failed so bad though!

3103
01:50:19,010 --> 01:50:21,080
Toshi-chan is amazing.

3104
01:50:20,980 --> 01:50:21,980
Everyone, are you ready?

3105
01:50:21,980 --> 01:50:27,680
First of all, one of you will be lock inside that transparent room.

3106
01:50:27,680 --> 01:50:30,180
And the other 5 people, in order to rescue that person

3107
01:50:30,750 --> 01:50:32,780
Pfft... Sorry.

3108
01:50:32,580 --> 01:50:34,750
What was so funny?

3109
01:50:33,250 --> 01:50:34,650
This area...

3110
01:50:34,750 --> 01:50:36,980
So cute.

3111
01:50:36,980 --> 01:50:38,510
Is that cute?

3112
01:50:39,010 --> 01:50:40,610
Oh, he's went there.

3113
01:50:40,610 --> 01:50:42,310
Excuse me.

3114
01:50:44,450 --> 01:50:47,550
How long are you gonna keep doing that!

3115
01:50:53,110 --> 01:50:54,310
This is weird!!

3116
01:50:54,310 --> 01:50:56,210
This is seriously weird!!

3117
01:50:56,210 --> 01:50:58,110
An oni is already out!!

3118
01:50:58,110 --> 01:51:01,810
It's better for the TV staffs if this person is not caught.

3119
01:51:02,050 --> 01:51:05,510
3 oni will come out at the same time at the beginning.

3120
01:51:02,210 --> 01:51:06,310
At the start, 3 oni will make an appearance at the same time

3121
01:51:02,210 --> 01:51:10,250
Surveillance Experiment

3122
01:51:02,210 --> 01:51:10,250
Surveillance Experiment

3123
01:51:05,510 --> 01:51:10,250
And after 10 minutes, more and more will come out.

3124
01:51:06,310 --> 01:51:10,250
Oni will increase after every 10 minutes

3125
01:51:10,510 --> 01:51:14,810
Someone will be trapped in the transparent room and the other will have to find the key.

3126
01:51:10,550 --> 01:51:18,050
Find the real key and rescue their friend

3127
01:51:10,550 --> 01:51:18,050
Surveillance Experiment

3128
01:51:10,550 --> 01:51:18,050
Surveillance Experiment

3129
01:51:14,810 --> 01:51:18,210
If they manage to rescue their friend, the experiment is a success.

3130
01:51:18,350 --> 01:51:20,980
I will announce who is the person that will be locked in that room.

3131
01:51:20,980 --> 01:51:22,810
Matsumoto! It's you!

3132
01:51:23,010 --> 01:51:25,310
It's true, I just recently injured my ribs.

3133
01:51:23,210 --> 01:51:26,010
Because my sides hurt, really

3134
01:51:26,010 --> 01:51:26,980
Since your sides are hurting

3135
01:51:26,010 --> 01:51:27,310
My sides hurt

3136
01:51:27,380 --> 01:51:28,380
Really!?

3137
01:51:28,610 --> 01:51:29,510
It's not hurting

3138
01:51:29,080 --> 01:51:30,910
No no no, really, it's true

3139
01:51:32,280 --> 01:51:34,680
What the hell is this person doing!? Seriously!!

3140
01:51:34,680 --> 01:51:38,110
I really hate this!!

3141
01:51:38,180 --> 01:51:40,080
I hate Tahara Toshihiko!!

3142
01:51:38,310 --> 01:51:39,510
That was pretty good

3143
01:51:44,110 --> 01:51:47,280
But if the key is wrong

3144
01:51:45,880 --> 01:51:47,280
and you try to open the door

3145
01:51:47,280 --> 01:51:49,680
harsh punishment for Matsumoto

3146
01:51:47,280 --> 01:51:49,680
right there and then, there will be a

3147
01:51:49,880 --> 01:51:56,610
If the key is wrong, a punishment for Matsumoto

3148
01:51:49,880 --> 01:51:56,610
Surveillance Experiment

3149
01:51:50,080 --> 01:51:53,680
Everyone, use the real key to rescue him

3150
01:51:51,010 --> 01:51:52,510
Are you serious?

3151
01:51:53,010 --> 01:51:56,010
Well well, let's just do our best

3152
01:51:56,610 --> 01:52:02,980
Until he is rescued, he cannot go outside

3153
01:52:03,350 --> 01:52:07,880
Do Not Get Caught Prison Escape

3154
01:52:08,380 --> 01:52:09,480
And now the experiment...

3155
01:52:09,680 --> 01:52:10,850
Starts!

3156
01:52:10,650 --> 01:52:12,850
Surveillance System Experiment Begins

3157
01:52:17,450 --> 01:52:19,180
What is it?!

3158
01:52:17,450 --> 01:52:29,880
Slipper

3159
01:52:19,480 --> 01:52:20,080
What?!

3160
01:52:22,850 --> 01:52:24,150
Ooohh!!

3161
01:52:24,150 --> 01:52:24,950
Ooohh!!

3162
01:52:24,950 --> 01:52:25,350
Alright alright ok ok ok!!

3163
01:52:25,350 --> 01:52:27,780
Alright alright ok ok ok!!

3164
01:52:25,980 --> 01:52:27,980
Already? Really?

3165
01:52:29,080 --> 01:52:30,780
That's gotta hurt

3166
01:52:31,750 --> 01:52:33,150
Ow...

3167
01:52:33,480 --> 01:52:35,180
Ow ow ow ow ow

3168
01:52:35,480 --> 01:52:36,750
That one sucks

3169
01:52:36,450 --> 01:52:38,280
Looks like a disaster

3170
01:52:38,280 --> 01:52:40,280
Fu hahahahaha

3171
01:52:41,280 --> 01:52:44,550
One just came out! Are there supposed to be this many?

3172
01:52:41,280 --> 01:52:44,650
Second oni's entrance

3173
01:52:41,550 --> 01:52:43,150
It's not over?

3174
01:52:45,110 --> 01:53:00,150
Paper Fan

3175
01:52:46,450 --> 01:52:47,650
Wait!!

3176
01:52:47,650 --> 01:52:48,750
That's dangerous!

3177
01:52:50,450 --> 01:52:51,750
Two of them

3178
01:53:00,650 --> 01:53:03,350
Fu hahahahahahaha

3179
01:53:03,850 --> 01:53:05,810
You are all full of energy!!

3180
01:53:06,150 --> 01:53:09,510
Watching and observing from afar

3181
01:53:06,150 --> 01:53:09,510
a nonchalant Matsumoto, on his own

3182
01:53:09,510 --> 01:53:11,510
This is the worst

3183
01:53:10,850 --> 01:53:12,050
They just keep coming!

3184
01:53:12,350 --> 01:53:13,650
What does that one say?

3185
01:53:13,710 --> 01:53:15,710
Ass Bat!!

3186
01:53:14,610 --> 01:53:15,450
Ass bat!

3187
01:53:14,610 --> 01:53:40,350
Ass Bat

3188
01:53:18,450 --> 01:53:20,450
Oh he's pretty fast!

3189
01:53:20,810 --> 01:53:21,810
Get Toshi-chan!

3190
01:53:21,810 --> 01:53:23,950
Toshi-chan runs really fast!!

3191
01:53:24,950 --> 01:53:26,450
Toshi-chan is going to get caught

3192
01:53:26,750 --> 01:53:27,950
Toshi-chan, you're going to get caught!

3193
01:53:28,110 --> 01:53:30,410
Catch Toshi-chan!!

3194
01:53:30,410 --> 01:53:33,210
Yes!! Toshi-chan got caught!

3195
01:53:34,750 --> 01:53:35,350
Tahara-san...

3196
01:53:35,350 --> 01:53:36,150
Toshi-chan's getting it!

3197
01:53:42,210 --> 01:53:44,010
That was a full swing

3198
01:53:43,110 --> 01:53:45,550
Ow, that hurt!!

3199
01:53:44,410 --> 01:53:46,950
Toshi-chan got a

3200
01:53:45,510 --> 01:53:46,950
full swing to the ass

3201
01:53:45,550 --> 01:53:47,550
That was awful!

3202
01:53:49,150 --> 01:53:49,710
Toshi-chan

3203
01:53:49,510 --> 01:53:52,410
That slipper hurt like hell!!

3204
01:53:51,450 --> 01:53:52,450
You did indeed say that

3205
01:53:52,450 --> 01:53:53,810
That was a full swing

3206
01:53:53,810 --> 01:53:55,550
That hurt!

3207
01:53:55,380 --> 01:53:58,580
Let's go search for that thing

3208
01:53:57,080 --> 01:53:58,580
with the key

3209
01:53:59,810 --> 01:54:01,280
Yeah really, let's search

3210
01:54:01,280 --> 01:54:03,280
He's here, hey, he's here!

3211
01:54:01,280 --> 01:54:03,280
It's Ass Bat!!

3212
01:54:01,580 --> 01:54:56,880
Ass Bat

3213
01:54:04,410 --> 01:54:06,210
Ass Bat is here!

3214
01:54:06,410 --> 01:54:07,910
This right here...

3215
01:54:06,410 --> 01:54:09,410
Hosei hiding behind Hamada

3216
01:54:09,410 --> 01:54:11,210
That's just the angle!

3217
01:54:11,410 --> 01:54:12,910
Wait wait wait

3218
01:54:13,480 --> 01:54:15,210
Ah...

3219
01:54:13,510 --> 01:54:14,610
See?

3220
01:54:15,280 --> 01:54:17,480
Damnit, you scared me!

3221
01:54:19,680 --> 01:54:21,610
That was so scary just then

3222
01:54:21,610 --> 01:54:23,010
Ah, it's Toshi-chan again

3223
01:54:23,710 --> 01:54:26,780
The oni is locked on

3224
01:54:26,710 --> 01:54:28,310
He's not going to get away

3225
01:54:27,080 --> 01:54:28,480
Tanaka, stop him!!

3226
01:54:27,780 --> 01:54:28,480
Stop Toshi-chan!!

3227
01:54:30,880 --> 01:54:32,480
Toshi-chan, not this way

3228
01:54:33,810 --> 01:54:35,810
Toshi-chan, he's going straight for you!

3229
01:54:34,610 --> 01:54:36,310
He doesn't have the energy

3230
01:54:35,810 --> 01:54:37,680
He's completely honed in on you!!

3231
01:54:39,110 --> 01:54:40,610
Why only me?

3232
01:54:41,610 --> 01:54:42,010
Eh!? Not me, wait a minute

3233
01:54:42,010 --> 01:54:42,410
Eh!? Not me, wait a minute

3234
01:54:42,410 --> 01:54:43,110
Eh!? Not me, wait a minute

3235
01:54:43,810 --> 01:54:47,280
Captures Hosei for some reason

3236
01:54:47,580 --> 01:54:47,680
Don't abandon your choice!

3237
01:54:47,580 --> 01:54:47,710
Don't abandon your choice!

3238
01:54:47,580 --> 01:54:47,810
Don't abandon your choice!

3239
01:54:47,610 --> 01:54:47,880
Don't abandon your choice!

3240
01:54:47,610 --> 01:54:47,880
Don't abandon your choice!

3241
01:54:47,680 --> 01:54:49,810
Don't abandon your choice!

3242
01:54:49,880 --> 01:54:50,080
Don't give up!!

3243
01:54:49,880 --> 01:54:50,110
Don't give up!!

3244
01:54:49,880 --> 01:54:50,180
Don't give up!!

3245
01:54:49,880 --> 01:54:50,180
Don't give up!!

3246
01:54:49,910 --> 01:54:50,180
Don't give up!!

3247
01:54:49,980 --> 01:54:51,980
Don't give up!!

3248
01:54:54,580 --> 01:54:55,210
Too soft

3249
01:54:54,980 --> 01:54:56,880
Alright alright alright

3250
01:54:55,810 --> 01:54:57,180
That was too soft

3251
01:54:57,180 --> 01:54:58,710
I was completely dragged into that situation

3252
01:54:58,780 --> 01:55:00,580
I was completely dragged into that situation

3253
01:55:00,680 --> 01:55:06,280
Punishment hell

3254
01:55:07,810 --> 01:55:10,810
The 5 of them don't have any time to spare

3255
01:55:12,180 --> 01:55:14,780
Where should I go?

3256
01:55:14,780 --> 01:55:17,310
I have no idea where the key is

3257
01:55:18,480 --> 01:55:28,080
Ass Bat

3258
01:55:20,710 --> 01:55:21,710
Oh, it's Hamada

3259
01:55:20,710 --> 01:55:23,710
Nooo wait a minute, just wait!

3260
01:55:23,310 --> 01:55:24,810
The Ass Bat got him

3261
01:55:30,010 --> 01:55:32,680
Hamada in pain and

3262
01:55:37,610 --> 01:55:39,180
Alright alright

3263
01:55:39,180 --> 01:55:42,880
A delighted evil Tanaka

3264
01:55:41,280 --> 01:55:42,880
They caught me doing that

3265
01:55:43,310 --> 01:55:52,810
Paper Fan

3266
01:55:44,010 --> 01:55:45,310
What do you mean, "Alright alright"

3267
01:55:47,310 --> 01:55:48,810
You didn't even try to run away

3268
01:55:58,110 --> 01:56:01,650
It's because you were enjoying me getting hit

3269
01:56:05,010 --> 01:56:10,050
Surveillance Experiment 10 minutes has passed

3270
01:56:07,250 --> 01:56:09,050
This was extremely long

3271
01:56:08,110 --> 01:56:11,450
Additional Onis are released

3272
01:56:08,750 --> 01:56:10,050
It really was

3273
01:56:12,210 --> 01:56:15,810
Hosei, searching for the key by himself

3274
01:56:17,210 --> 01:56:26,510
?

3275
01:56:18,950 --> 01:56:19,350
Uehhh!! Ehhh!!

3276
01:56:19,350 --> 01:56:19,750
Uehhh!! Ehhh!!

3277
01:56:19,750 --> 01:56:20,250
What!? Hold on a second!!

3278
01:56:20,250 --> 01:56:20,850
What!? Hold on a second!!

3279
01:56:20,850 --> 01:56:21,450
Wait!! What is this!?

3280
01:56:21,450 --> 01:56:22,050
Wait!! What is this!?

3281
01:56:22,150 --> 01:56:22,150
Hold on!!

3282
01:56:22,150 --> 01:56:22,150
Hold on!!

3283
01:56:22,150 --> 01:56:22,150
Hold on!!

3284
01:56:22,150 --> 01:56:22,210
Hold on!!

3285
01:56:22,150 --> 01:56:22,250
Hold on!!

3286
01:56:22,150 --> 01:56:22,250
Hold on!!

3287
01:56:22,250 --> 01:56:22,250
Hold on!!

3288
01:56:22,250 --> 01:56:22,250
Hold on!!

3289
01:56:22,250 --> 01:56:22,350
Hold on!!

3290
01:56:22,350 --> 01:56:22,350
Hold on!!

3291
01:56:22,350 --> 01:56:22,410
Hold on!!

3292
01:56:22,410 --> 01:56:22,450
Hold on!!

3293
01:56:22,450 --> 01:56:23,650
Hold on!!

3294
01:56:22,950 --> 01:56:22,950
Ahhh!!

3295
01:56:22,950 --> 01:56:23,050
Ahhh!!

3296
01:56:23,050 --> 01:56:23,050
Ahhh!!

3297
01:56:23,050 --> 01:56:23,050
Ahhh!!

3298
01:56:23,050 --> 01:56:23,150
Ahhh!!

3299
01:56:23,150 --> 01:56:23,150
Ahhh!!

3300
01:56:23,150 --> 01:56:23,150
Ahhh!!

3301
01:56:23,150 --> 01:56:23,250
Ahhh!!

3302
01:56:23,250 --> 01:56:23,650
Ahhh!!

3303
01:56:23,650 --> 01:56:25,350
What the hell is this!

3304
01:56:25,750 --> 01:56:26,450
Wait

3305
01:56:26,450 --> 01:56:31,010
Giant shackles 150cm in diameter

3306
01:56:26,510 --> 01:56:27,350
What's going on?!

3307
01:56:26,550 --> 01:56:31,010
Shackles

3308
01:56:27,550 --> 01:56:31,010
Oh come one! Give me a break!!

3309
01:56:31,250 --> 01:56:31,810
What is that!? That!! What is that!?

3310
01:56:31,810 --> 01:56:32,150
What is that!? That!! What is that!?

3311
01:56:32,150 --> 01:56:33,610
What is that!? That!! What is that!?

3312
01:56:33,610 --> 01:56:35,550
What was that just now?

3313
01:56:38,350 --> 01:56:40,010
What a nuisance!!

3314
01:56:40,810 --> 01:56:43,310
You're so easy to find now!!

3315
01:56:43,310 --> 01:56:45,210
Easy to find...

3316
01:56:45,210 --> 01:56:46,950
This thing is too huge!!

3317
01:56:47,550 --> 01:56:49,250
Hey Endo...

3318
01:56:49,550 --> 01:56:51,550
It's impossible with that...

3319
01:56:50,750 --> 01:56:52,750
No, Hosei, no way

3320
01:56:55,050 --> 01:56:56,850
What the hell is this

3321
01:56:57,250 --> 01:57:12,310
Slipper

3322
01:57:04,610 --> 01:57:06,950
He's making use of the sphere

3323
01:57:07,850 --> 01:57:08,650
That's no good!

3324
01:57:09,850 --> 01:57:11,250
I hate that one the most

3325
01:57:17,080 --> 01:57:18,780
This is hell

3326
01:57:18,780 --> 01:57:19,880
This is hell

3327
01:57:20,450 --> 01:57:24,150
5 of them search the building interior

3328
01:57:20,650 --> 01:57:22,950
Over here, this path here

3329
01:57:22,950 --> 01:57:24,180
Since there's a bunch of doors

3330
01:57:23,580 --> 01:57:24,380
Let's go

3331
01:57:27,080 --> 01:57:29,580
You can't enter here

3332
01:57:29,580 --> 01:57:30,080
I can

3333
01:57:31,180 --> 01:57:31,980
Can you go through?

3334
01:57:31,880 --> 01:57:32,480
Yes

3335
01:57:33,880 --> 01:57:34,850
Just right!!

3336
01:57:34,850 --> 01:57:36,280
So noisy

3337
01:57:35,150 --> 01:57:38,850
The 3 search the hallway

3338
01:57:37,180 --> 01:57:38,850
Go, go look inside

3339
01:57:40,150 --> 01:57:41,550
I wonder if the oni are gonna come

3340
01:57:41,550 --> 01:57:43,680
If I do this, I can get all of them at once right now

3341
01:57:43,680 --> 01:57:45,950
If the oni come from that side

3342
01:57:49,180 --> 01:57:51,180
Ehh, really on this floor though?

3343
01:57:50,250 --> 01:58:47,480
Slipper

3344
01:57:53,180 --> 01:57:56,150
Endo abandons Hamada

3345
01:57:57,980 --> 01:57:59,380
It was like that, huh

3346
01:58:08,150 --> 01:58:11,850
Hey you!!

3347
01:58:09,050 --> 01:58:11,850
Don't mess with me!!

3348
01:58:11,850 --> 01:58:13,150
What kind of face is that!!

3349
01:58:13,150 --> 01:58:14,880
What kind of face is that!!

3350
01:58:15,280 --> 01:58:16,680
Hold on hold on hold on

3351
01:58:15,880 --> 01:58:47,480
Ass Bat

3352
01:58:16,850 --> 01:58:18,080
This guy is the worst!!

3353
01:58:18,680 --> 01:58:22,450
Hosei betrays his comrades

3354
01:58:18,780 --> 01:58:20,580
No, don't you dare double up

3355
01:58:20,580 --> 01:58:22,180
You can't double up!

3356
01:58:22,750 --> 01:58:24,280
You can't double up!!

3357
01:58:23,680 --> 01:58:25,280
Don't double up!

3358
01:58:24,450 --> 01:58:24,780
Oni!! Look!! Over there!!

3359
01:58:24,780 --> 01:58:25,450
Oni!! Look!! Over there!!

3360
01:58:25,450 --> 01:58:26,580
Oni!! Look!! Over there!!

3361
01:58:26,580 --> 01:58:27,750
There's another person over there

3362
01:58:28,480 --> 01:58:29,750
You!!

3363
01:58:30,180 --> 01:58:31,780
Get out of the damn way!!

3364
01:58:38,310 --> 01:58:39,080
Please

3365
01:58:39,080 --> 01:58:40,480
Wait, please!!

3366
01:58:40,480 --> 01:58:43,610
No no, this guy is the worst

3367
01:58:45,210 --> 01:58:47,110
Seriously, it's all Yamasaki

3368
01:58:47,010 --> 01:58:47,980
It was a double!! Double!!

3369
01:58:47,980 --> 01:58:50,080
It was a double!! Double!!

3370
01:58:50,210 --> 01:58:54,080
Ass Bat

3371
01:58:50,210 --> 01:58:54,080
Immediately aiming for Hosei is

3372
01:58:50,280 --> 01:59:03,480
Ass Bat

3373
01:58:55,550 --> 01:58:57,550
In the end, you get hit anyway

3374
01:59:02,410 --> 01:59:02,580
AHHH HAHHHHH!!

3375
01:59:02,580 --> 01:59:02,610
AHHH HAHHHHH!!

3376
01:59:02,580 --> 01:59:02,680
AHHHH HAHHHH!!

3377
01:59:02,680 --> 01:59:02,710
AHHH HAHHHHH!!

3378
01:59:02,680 --> 01:59:02,780
AHHH HAHHHHH!!

3379
01:59:02,780 --> 01:59:02,810
AHHH HAHHHHH!!

3380
01:59:02,780 --> 01:59:02,880
AHHH HAHHHHH!!

3381
01:59:02,880 --> 01:59:02,910
AHHH HAHHHHH!!

3382
01:59:02,880 --> 01:59:02,980
AHHH HAHHHHH!!

3383
01:59:02,980 --> 01:59:05,410
AHHH HAHHHHH!!

3384
01:59:07,850 --> 01:59:09,950
You were also running for your life

3385
01:59:09,950 --> 01:59:11,250
Huh?

3386
01:59:11,850 --> 01:59:15,050
"You can't double up, you can't double up"

3387
01:59:12,850 --> 01:59:14,910
That black thing is still attached to him

3388
01:59:14,910 --> 01:59:16,810
You're really an awful person

3389
01:59:17,810 --> 01:59:20,050
Watch out watch out watch out

3390
01:59:20,280 --> 01:59:22,180
Why are you doing this!?

3391
01:59:22,080 --> 01:59:23,880
This is dangerous!

3392
01:59:22,180 --> 01:59:25,080
What the hell is wrong with you!!

3393
01:59:24,080 --> 01:59:26,380
What's wrong?

3394
01:59:25,410 --> 01:59:26,810
What is going on, Yamasaki?

3395
01:59:26,980 --> 01:59:29,080
If you don't move this out of the way...

3396
01:59:28,080 --> 01:59:29,580
It'll be your fault that we...

3397
01:59:29,110 --> 01:59:29,250
Don't give me, "Move this out of the way"!!

3398
01:59:29,150 --> 01:59:29,410
Don't give me, "Move this out of the way"!!

3399
01:59:29,150 --> 01:59:29,410
Don't give me, "Move this out of the way"!!

3400
01:59:29,210 --> 01:59:29,410
Don't give me, "Move this out of the way"!!

3401
01:59:29,210 --> 01:59:29,510
Don't give me, "Move this out of the way"!!

3402
01:59:29,210 --> 01:59:31,510
Don't give me, "Move this out of the way"!!

3403
01:59:31,550 --> 01:59:33,950
I got hit with a double over here!!

3404
01:59:31,550 --> 01:59:33,950
It's your fault

3405
01:59:33,950 --> 01:59:35,450
No you didn't!!

3406
01:59:35,050 --> 01:59:36,150
Yeah I did!

3407
01:59:35,750 --> 01:59:37,410
I got hit too!!

3408
01:59:38,410 --> 01:59:40,250
I've had enough of all of you!!

3409
01:59:38,510 --> 01:59:49,610
Paper Fan

3410
01:59:41,050 --> 01:59:41,050
WAHHHHHHHHH!!

3411
01:59:41,050 --> 01:59:41,150
WAHHHHHHHHH!!

3412
01:59:41,150 --> 01:59:41,150
WAHHHHHHHHH!!

3413
01:59:41,150 --> 01:59:41,250
WAHHHHHHHHH!!

3414
01:59:41,250 --> 01:59:41,310
WAHHHHHHHHH!!

3415
01:59:41,310 --> 01:59:41,350
WAHHHHHHHHH!!

3416
01:59:41,350 --> 01:59:41,410
WAHHHHHHHHH!!

3417
01:59:41,410 --> 01:59:41,450
WAHHHHHHHHH!!

3418
01:59:41,450 --> 01:59:41,510
WAHHHHHHHHH!!

3419
01:59:41,510 --> 01:59:41,550
WAHHHHHHHHH!!

3420
01:59:41,550 --> 01:59:44,450
WAHHHHHHHHH!!

3421
01:59:47,610 --> 01:59:48,910
Of course that would happen

3422
01:59:48,910 --> 01:59:50,010
Of course that'd happen just like that

3423
01:59:50,010 --> 01:59:51,710
Of course that'd happen just like that

3424
01:59:52,610 --> 01:59:53,750
See? See?

3425
01:59:54,910 --> 01:59:59,180
Toshi-chan all by himself

3426
01:59:59,850 --> 02:00:02,950
Are those guys trying to plan something?

3427
02:00:02,950 --> 02:00:03,680
Those guys leave me by myself too much

3428
02:00:03,680 --> 02:00:06,550
Those guys leave me by myself too much

3429
02:00:06,550 --> 02:00:07,850
He doesn't come with us

3430
02:00:07,210 --> 02:00:08,680
You definitely see the truth in people. Like Yamasaki and Tanaka

3431
02:00:07,850 --> 02:00:08,650
You're right

3432
02:00:08,680 --> 02:00:13,110
You definitely see the truth in people. Like Yamasaki and Tanaka

3433
02:00:10,280 --> 02:00:13,110
you both have despicable natures

3434
02:00:12,510 --> 02:00:15,010
Well, if you say that, it applies to everyone

3435
02:00:14,080 --> 02:00:14,710
Ah!! Ahhh!!

3436
02:00:14,710 --> 02:00:15,210
Ah!! Ahhh!!

3437
02:00:15,210 --> 02:00:17,710
Isn't that the key!? The key!!

3438
02:00:18,010 --> 02:00:19,610
Should we wait for Toshi-chan?

3439
02:00:19,610 --> 02:00:20,610
It's a treasure box

3440
02:00:20,050 --> 02:00:22,310
Toshi, we found it, it's right here!

3441
02:00:22,310 --> 02:00:24,010
Wait for me!!

3442
02:00:24,010 --> 02:00:24,610
Wait for me!!

3443
02:00:25,010 --> 02:00:26,810
I'll check it!!

3444
02:00:27,010 --> 02:00:29,650
Discovered a treasure box

3445
02:00:27,950 --> 02:00:28,550
Okay

3446
02:00:28,550 --> 02:00:31,150
With this, we can release...

3447
02:00:31,150 --> 02:00:31,950
Oh!

3448
02:00:31,750 --> 02:00:32,850
It's a key

3449
02:00:33,510 --> 02:00:34,610
Then let's open the door, let's go

3450
02:00:34,610 --> 02:00:36,310
Then let's open the door, let's go

3451
02:00:35,150 --> 02:00:35,950
Yes

3452
02:00:35,950 --> 02:00:37,250
That's amazing

3453
02:00:37,250 --> 02:00:38,450
Let's go rescue him

3454
02:00:38,580 --> 02:00:42,150
Um, Yamasaki, you're in the way

3455
02:00:39,980 --> 02:00:41,180
You're exactly right

3456
02:00:42,180 --> 02:00:45,150
That's only going to lure them in

3457
02:00:45,150 --> 02:00:48,380
You're doing that pretty cleverly

3458
02:00:48,980 --> 02:00:52,980
To Matsumoto who has been waiting

3459
02:00:50,380 --> 02:00:51,880
So damn noisy

3460
02:00:51,480 --> 02:00:52,580
Hurry up

3461
02:00:52,480 --> 02:00:52,980
Yes

3462
02:00:52,750 --> 02:00:53,280
Yes

3463
02:00:57,950 --> 02:01:00,580
Open it please!!

3464
02:00:58,650 --> 02:01:00,580
If we can open it, it'll be over

3465
02:01:00,880 --> 02:01:02,680
It doesn't fit?

3466
02:01:02,680 --> 02:01:05,150
It doesn't fit

3467
02:01:05,280 --> 02:01:06,180
It's too big

3468
02:01:06,180 --> 02:01:08,180
It doesn't fit?

3469
02:01:06,380 --> 02:01:07,780
The shape is different

3470
02:01:08,250 --> 02:01:14,280
Commence Matsumoto's punishment

3471
02:01:14,380 --> 02:01:15,480
Who is it?

3472
02:01:15,780 --> 02:01:16,880
Is it that person?

3473
02:01:16,580 --> 02:01:18,280
Ah, it's Obachan

3474
02:01:19,480 --> 02:01:20,980
It's Obachan

3475
02:01:20,980 --> 02:01:22,380
She's shaking her hips

3476
02:01:22,510 --> 02:01:23,910
She's shaking it

3477
02:01:23,380 --> 02:01:24,380
Man...

3478
02:01:23,380 --> 02:01:53,610
Note: Song is Emmanuelle (French Version) by Pierre Bachelet

3479
02:01:35,510 --> 02:01:38,380
She started with the forehead

3480
02:01:45,310 --> 02:01:47,280
So gentle...

3481
02:01:47,280 --> 02:01:50,610
She's so kind!

3482
02:01:52,410 --> 02:01:55,010
She didn't go for the mouth or anything

3483
02:01:54,880 --> 02:01:56,880
I'm sorry!!

3484
02:01:54,880 --> 02:01:56,880
We're sorry

3485
02:01:56,310 --> 02:01:57,910
Come on guys seriously, get your shit together

3486
02:01:58,780 --> 02:02:00,780
We had to try

3487
02:01:59,650 --> 02:02:02,650
Doing this loads of time is too tough

3488
02:02:03,450 --> 02:02:05,450
I understand

3489
02:02:03,450 --> 02:02:05,550
Like seriously, I'm begging you, hurry...

3490
02:02:05,550 --> 02:02:06,450
Do you not think we can try
that key one more time guys?

3491
02:02:06,450 --> 02:02:08,710
Do you not think we can try that key one more time guys?

3492
02:02:08,710 --> 02:02:09,910
Don't say shit like that!!

3493
02:02:08,710 --> 02:02:10,710
Maybe...

3494
02:02:12,310 --> 02:02:13,410
We'll try the other way.

3495
02:02:13,710 --> 02:02:14,710
Leave it out!

3496
02:02:14,710 --> 02:02:16,610
Tanaka, just stick it in anyway.

3497
02:02:17,050 --> 02:02:18,610
Wait, what?...

3498
02:02:19,350 --> 02:02:20,210
Really, you come now?

3499
02:02:20,350 --> 02:02:24,210
ONI arrives, not reading the atmosphere at all

3500
02:02:23,510 --> 02:02:24,510
You're kidding me...

3501
02:02:24,510 --> 02:02:25,750
What bad timing Tanaka, eh?

3502
02:02:25,750 --> 02:02:26,650
I know, this timing is just...

3503
02:02:26,650 --> 02:02:29,250
Man this takes a while...

3504
02:02:28,550 --> 02:02:31,250
Of course it's going to take time

3505
02:02:34,250 --> 02:02:36,110
Tanaka, let's try opening the door with that key again

3506
02:02:36,110 --> 02:02:38,250
We can't do anything obviously if it's wrong but...

3507
02:02:38,710 --> 02:02:40,850
Maybe Toshi-chan put the key in the wrong way, you never know...

3508
02:02:41,110 --> 02:02:44,710
There's no way...

3509
02:02:44,710 --> 02:02:46,510
Go!

3510
02:02:46,510 --> 02:02:48,710
I know it made the wrong sound now as well...

3511
02:02:47,450 --> 02:02:48,710
but it was wrong before as well...

3512
02:02:49,210 --> 02:02:52,110
so don't use the same key

3513
02:02:50,310 --> 02:02:52,110
again and again...

3514
02:02:52,610 --> 02:02:54,850
You guys just did it before...

3515
02:02:54,850 --> 02:02:57,450
You knew it was going to be wrong...

3516
02:02:57,450 --> 02:02:58,510
Yeah, so of course I knew it was going to be wrong

3517
02:02:59,250 --> 02:03:01,650
Wow shit, she's already here

3518
02:03:06,410 --> 02:03:08,310
She went for it

3519
02:03:09,710 --> 02:03:12,050
It's the scent which really gets you

3520
02:03:12,050 --> 02:03:13,050
The mouth soon...

3521
02:03:13,050 --> 02:03:14,550
Of course, of course

3522
02:03:16,380 --> 02:03:18,380
He's closed his eyes and all guys!

3523
02:03:20,510 --> 02:03:22,980
He's left it all up to the Obachan...

3524
02:03:30,480 --> 02:03:32,010
Look at him...

3525
02:03:33,350 --> 02:03:36,880
Don't fucking use

3526
02:03:34,480 --> 02:03:36,880
the same key again and again!!

3527
02:03:36,880 --> 02:03:39,250
I can't hear what he's saying, can you?

3528
02:04:01,960 --> 02:04:04,860
30 Minutes have past in the experiment

3529
02:04:05,090 --> 02:04:07,890
We are now increasing the numbers of Onis...

3530
02:04:10,250 --> 02:04:11,150
Tanaka-kun!!

3531
02:04:11,350 --> 02:04:14,650
Quick! Please, come, come with me.

3532
02:04:14,580 --> 02:04:29,580
Daddy Endo

3533
02:04:16,280 --> 02:04:17,880
What the hell are you doing?

3534
02:04:17,880 --> 02:04:19,880
Hold on, father, sir...

3535
02:04:19,880 --> 02:04:21,410
Is this normal?...

3536
02:04:22,150 --> 02:04:24,310
Father, sir, what are you doing?

3537
02:04:23,310 --> 02:04:24,310
What are you doing?

3538
02:04:24,310 --> 02:04:25,910
I'm playng Onigokko (Tag)

3539
02:04:25,910 --> 02:04:27,250
It's fine, it's fine.

3540
02:04:26,450 --> 02:04:27,310
Wait, what?

3541
02:04:27,110 --> 02:04:30,310
Hey guys, it's Tanaka-kun!!

3542
02:04:30,450 --> 02:04:34,410
Endo Family takes him in

3543
02:04:30,550 --> 02:06:02,710
Endo Family

3544
02:04:32,810 --> 02:04:34,910
Just please, wait, hold on a second.

3545
02:04:34,880 --> 02:04:37,710
What exactly are the Endo family doing here?

3546
02:04:39,980 --> 02:04:41,010
(Endo Father) Tanaka kun

3547
02:04:41,010 --> 02:04:41,880
(Endo Father) thank you for

3548
02:04:41,880 --> 02:04:43,680
(Endo Father) taking care of Shozo all the time.

3549
02:04:43,680 --> 02:04:45,310
No no, he always takes care of me and all too so...

3550
02:04:45,310 --> 02:04:48,080
You got a stiff neck so I will massage you.

3551
02:04:48,980 --> 02:04:51,380
(Endo Father) It's been ages since

3552
02:04:51,380 --> 02:04:53,180
(Endo Father) you debuted with Shozo as a combo

3553
02:04:53,180 --> 02:04:56,080
Yeah you're right, it's 22 years now

3554
02:04:56,080 --> 02:04:58,910
(Endo Father) Thank you for always looking after him

3555
02:04:58,910 --> 02:05:00,010

3556
02:05:00,010 --> 02:05:01,410
(Endo Mother) And you

3557
02:05:01,410 --> 02:05:03,010
(Endo Mother) are working with Uchimura-kun

3558
02:05:03,010 --> 02:05:05,010
(Endo Mother) and Okamura-san

3559
02:05:05,010 --> 02:05:06,780
(Endo Mother) and you're on lots of TV shows

3560
02:05:06,980 --> 02:05:09,910
(Endo Mother) you seem to be earning a hell of a lot at the moment, huh?

3561
02:05:10,480 --> 02:05:15,310
Mother jealous of his success

3562
02:05:11,310 --> 02:05:13,210
No, I'm really not

3563
02:05:13,210 --> 02:05:15,210
But you look like you're earning loads

3564
02:05:15,580 --> 02:05:18,080
(Endo Mother) So please sort out Shouzou as well please...

3565
02:05:18,810 --> 02:05:20,080
(Endo Mother) Please please

3566

(Endo Mother) take care of Shouzou as well.

3567
02:05:23,180 --> 02:05:24,180
Come here you piece of...

3568
02:05:24,680 --> 02:05:27,680
The father suddenly gets angry

3569
02:05:30,380 --> 02:05:33,610
Endo family's pro wrestling move

3570
02:05:37,110 --> 02:05:38,510
Give up?

3571
02:05:39,610 --> 02:05:41,910
I give up!!!

3572
02:05:48,280 --> 02:05:50,110
YOSHAAAAAA (COME ON!!)

3573
02:05:50,280 --> 02:05:55,510
Endo family defeat Tanaka

3574
02:05:50,510 --> 02:05:53,880
What the hell man!!

3575
02:05:56,250 --> 02:05:59,350
(Endo Father) Okay, so take care of Shouzou.

3576
02:06:01,550 --> 02:06:02,380
Okay, well anyway... Take care...

3577
02:06:02,850 --> 02:06:06,980
Meanwhile, the other 4...

3578
02:06:04,450 --> 02:06:06,680
I've found something I could use

3579
02:06:15,550 --> 02:06:16,950
Hold on, I might be able to use this to my advantage...

3580
02:06:17,150 --> 02:06:32,880
Slipper

3581
02:06:21,650 --> 02:06:22,850
What!?

3582
02:06:23,950 --> 02:06:26,150
No

3583
02:06:26,150 --> 02:06:26,850
Please no!!

3584
02:06:34,510 --> 02:06:36,080
What?

3585
02:06:36,080 --> 02:06:37,880
Oh my god, it's off!!

3586
02:06:38,710 --> 02:06:40,680
I'm so happy!

3587
02:06:42,080 --> 02:06:44,410
He was a real good guy!!

3588
02:06:44,510 --> 02:06:46,810
He was a real good guy!!

3589
02:06:47,810 --> 02:06:49,310
Hosei-san's been freed from his shackles

3590
02:06:49,310 --> 02:06:50,810
Yeah!!

3591
02:06:50,110 --> 02:06:50,980
For real?

3592
02:06:50,710 --> 02:06:51,080
Yes

3593
02:07:04,780 --> 02:07:06,980
What the hell are you mumbling?

3594
02:07:06,980 --> 02:07:09,080
Emmanuelle.

3595
02:07:09,080 --> 02:07:10,810
Oh I see

3596
02:07:09,210 --> 02:07:14,610
Obachan prepares herself next door

3597
02:07:19,980 --> 02:07:21,710
Endo, I got it off

3598
02:07:20,980 --> 02:07:21,810
I'm happy for you

3599
02:07:21,810 --> 02:07:22,610
How?

3600
02:07:22,610 --> 02:07:23,410
The Oni

3601
02:07:23,410 --> 02:07:24,880
took it off for you?

3602
02:07:23,850 --> 02:07:24,980
There's an Oni who will take it off for you

3603
02:07:24,980 --> 02:07:27,350
A genuinely good guy

3604
02:07:25,850 --> 02:07:27,480
I see

3605
02:07:26,450 --> 02:07:27,450
For real?

3606
02:07:27,650 --> 02:07:29,150
Wait, where did Tanaka go?

3607
02:07:29,150 --> 02:07:32,680
Tanaka is having things done to him in one of the rooms

3608
02:07:31,750 --> 02:07:32,750
For real?

3609
02:07:32,880 --> 02:07:35,580
They run to the building to find Tanaka

3610
02:07:40,980 --> 02:07:42,450
Toshi-chan said

3611
02:07:42,450 --> 02:07:45,350
Tanaka is screaming in one of the rooms...

3612
02:07:45,980 --> 02:07:47,380
Oh, no no...

3613
02:07:47,180 --> 02:07:48,680
You're okay?

3614
02:07:47,680 --> 02:07:49,050
It wasn't me

3615
02:07:48,680 --> 02:07:49,780
Oh right...

3616
02:07:49,050 --> 02:07:49,780
Yup...

3617
02:07:49,780 --> 02:07:53,780
Tanaka casually lies

3618
02:07:54,080 --> 02:07:55,450
He's such a bastard, right?

3619
02:07:55,810 --> 02:07:59,910
I can't fully understand what has just happened in all honesty

3620
02:08:01,410 --> 02:08:04,310
Toshi-chan alone... again

3621
02:08:02,650 --> 02:08:04,210
Man I'm thirsty...

3622
02:08:04,610 --> 02:08:07,310
Matsumoto's having tea, he's so lucky...

3623
02:08:10,710 --> 02:08:13,150
You got tea?

3624
02:08:13,150 --> 02:08:15,150
I didn't have anything to do

3625
02:08:19,910 --> 02:08:21,810
You really love this song.

3626
02:08:20,950 --> 02:08:22,850
Hum a different tune!

3627
02:08:24,450 --> 02:08:26,050
You're loving it!

3628
02:08:25,010 --> 02:08:26,250
Like really getting into it

3629
02:08:26,210 --> 02:08:29,110
I haven't seen Tanaka...

3630
02:08:29,110 --> 02:08:30,810
He was trapped in one the rooms

3631
02:08:29,450 --> 02:08:31,050
Tanaka was over there.

3632
02:08:31,010 --> 02:08:32,550
When?

3633
02:08:31,850 --> 02:08:32,550
Just now

3634
02:08:32,550 --> 02:08:33,410
For real?

3635
02:08:33,810 --> 02:08:35,850
He was definitely here before

3636
02:08:37,380 --> 02:08:38,480
Look look look

3637
02:08:38,480 --> 02:08:41,010
Where were you? We were looking for you for ages

3638
02:08:41,010 --> 02:08:43,250
Sorry, I was looking for the key!

3639
02:08:45,280 --> 02:08:46,150
You were looking for the key?

3640
02:08:46,150 --> 02:08:48,150
Yes, I was looking for it

3641
02:08:48,150 --> 02:08:50,150
That's fine, that's fine

3642
02:08:50,150 --> 02:08:52,150
That's fine that's fine

3643
02:08:51,480 --> 02:08:52,880
Hamada-san

3644
02:08:51,980 --> 02:08:52,880
WOW!!

3645
02:08:53,150 --> 02:09:01,980
Daddy Endo

3646
02:08:53,480 --> 02:08:55,580
Can I just borrow you for a bit?...

3647
02:08:55,580 --> 02:08:58,650
Welcome, welcome

3648
02:08:58,880 --> 02:09:01,980
Hamada falls for his trap

3649
02:09:00,150 --> 02:09:01,180
This way, welcome

3650
02:09:01,180 --> 02:09:01,680
Ummm... okay

3651
02:09:02,350 --> 02:09:04,150
Tanaka's fucking face

3652
02:09:03,650 --> 02:09:07,650
Evil Tanaka laughs at Hamada's misfortune

3653
02:09:07,880 --> 02:10:47,450
Endo family

3654
02:09:08,480 --> 02:09:10,150
Hey, it's Hamada-san!

3655
02:09:10,150 --> 02:09:12,850
He's always been good to us

3656
02:09:11,080 --> 02:09:12,750
Oh, hello there

3657
02:09:13,650 --> 02:09:14,550
You've taken good care of us

3658
02:09:14,550 --> 02:09:16,050
Please, please sit down

3659
02:09:16,950 --> 02:09:17,450
Umm, yes

3660
02:09:17,880 --> 02:09:19,280
(Endo Mother) Thank you for always taking care of us

3661
02:09:19,280 --> 02:09:21,950
Thank you for taking care of our son all the time

3662
02:09:20,750 --> 02:09:22,380
No no no, it's not a problem at all

3663
02:09:22,380 --> 02:09:26,080
(Endo Father) You've been good to him for over 20 years now so thank you so much...

3664
02:09:24,150 --> 02:09:26,080
No no no, not a problem

3665
02:09:26,080 --> 02:09:28,250
Your muscles are tight so I'm going

3666
02:09:27,550 --> 02:09:28,380
No no, I'm totally fine

3667
02:09:28,250 --> 02:09:29,150
today is a tough day for you too

3668
02:09:29,150 --> 02:09:31,150
No no, father, sir, it's fine

3669
02:09:31,150 --> 02:09:33,450
I've never given a massage so this is the best I can do...

3670
02:09:32,580 --> 02:09:33,750
No no, that's great

3671
02:09:33,710 --> 02:09:35,510
Does it feel good?

3672
02:09:35,510 --> 02:09:37,050
(Endo Mother) Hamada-san

3673
02:09:37,050 --> 02:09:40,310
I've heard you're quite

3674
02:09:38,310 --> 02:09:40,310
close with Nan-chan

3675
02:09:40,310 --> 02:09:43,150
and I have a little request...

3676
02:09:41,010 --> 02:09:42,550
Oh, yes, umm okay...

3677
02:09:43,150 --> 02:09:45,910
Shouzou is on the TV program 'Hirunandesu' ...

3678
02:09:45,010 --> 02:09:46,510
Oh yes, I know..

3679
02:09:46,210 --> 02:09:49,710
But he told me that Nan-chan isn't that nice to him...

3680
02:09:49,910 --> 02:09:55,610
Endo's mother is concerned about her son's slow advancement in his career

3681
02:09:51,910 --> 02:09:55,610
and I've been really concerned about everything...

3682
02:09:54,950 --> 02:09:56,450
Oh, really?...

3683
02:09:55,610 --> 02:09:58,650
Could you get in a good word...

3684
02:09:58,650 --> 02:10:01,110
with Nan-chan for him?

3685
02:09:59,750 --> 02:10:00,750
No no, umm...

3686
02:10:00,750 --> 02:10:03,150
They are really friendly with one another

3687
02:10:03,150 --> 02:10:05,610
They are doing their job fine together

3688
02:10:04,410 --> 02:10:05,150
Are they really?...

3689
02:10:05,150 --> 02:10:05,950
Yes yes

3690
02:10:05,550 --> 02:10:06,580
Endo Shouzou

3691
02:10:06,580 --> 02:10:07,550
our first son

3692
02:10:07,550 --> 02:10:08,750
please take care of him

3693
02:10:10,750 --> 02:10:15,850
The Dad freaks out again

3694
02:10:18,280 --> 02:10:19,780
What the fuck are you doing!!

3695
02:10:21,180 --> 02:10:25,680
What the hell, what's going on?!

3696
02:10:25,650 --> 02:10:28,080
What the hell is wrong with this family!!

3697
02:10:29,750 --> 02:10:31,550
YEEEAAAHHH!!!

3698
02:10:35,950 --> 02:10:37,550
YEAAAHHH!!!

3699
02:10:37,850 --> 02:10:42,150
Endo family get revenge for their son

3700
02:10:38,880 --> 02:10:40,850
BANZAAIII!!!

3701
02:10:40,550 --> 02:10:43,050
What the hell, man...

3702
02:10:43,050 --> 02:10:44,280
I'm fine..

3703
02:10:44,280 --> 02:10:46,050
What the hell, seriously...

3704
02:10:46,050 --> 02:10:47,350
Hold on a moment..

3705
02:10:47,350 --> 02:10:49,150
what the hell, man!

3706
02:10:49,980 --> 02:10:53,180
Your bloody family!...

3707
02:10:53,180 --> 02:10:56,850
Y-... You framed me.

3708
02:10:56,850 --> 02:10:58,750
Tanaka...

3709
02:10:58,150 --> 02:11:00,550
Wait, what, what? I'm lost...

3710
02:11:00,550 --> 02:11:02,680
Apparently he was in the building screaming before...

3711
02:11:02,680 --> 02:11:04,750
according to Toshi-chan... that's what the screaming was all about, right?

3712
02:11:04,750 --> 02:11:06,680
Yup!

3713
02:11:09,280 --> 02:11:13,450
Tanaka was getting his arse handed to before.

3714
02:11:13,450 --> 02:11:16,250
He's trying to play dumb

3715
02:11:16,210 --> 02:11:17,110
You were with the Endos, right?

3716
02:11:17,110 --> 02:11:19,310
Why would you say all of this?..

3717
02:11:19,310 --> 02:11:20,810
Are you saying you weren't?

3718
02:11:20,810 --> 02:11:22,810
I mean... I was but...

3719
02:11:22,810 --> 02:11:24,150
Please don't say it...

3720
02:11:24,210 --> 02:11:27,250
Enough of that, let's find the key!

3721
02:11:27,250 --> 02:11:29,250
Yeah, let's find the key

3722
02:11:30,110 --> 02:11:33,210
Meanwhile, at the Endos

3723
02:11:34,050 --> 02:11:36,950
As expected, Hamada-san is easy to talk to, huh?

3724
02:11:36,950 --> 02:11:39,350
He's such a nice guy

3725
02:11:39,350 --> 02:11:41,210
He's so respectful

3726
02:11:42,310 --> 02:11:44,250
You fucking kidding me?

3727
02:11:42,510 --> 02:11:43,510
You’re kidding me.

3728
02:11:43,210 --> 02:11:45,550
(Endo Father) He’s genuine.

3729
02:11:45,750 --> 02:11:47,350
(Endo Father) We're done.

3730
02:11:45,950 --> 02:11:49,610
That was dangerous to record on tape.

3731
02:11:49,610 --> 02:11:50,610
What are they doing?

3732
02:11:50,010 --> 02:11:53,650
Leave them chatting there

3733
02:11:50,010 --> 02:11:53,650
and you don't know what

3734
02:11:50,010 --> 02:11:53,650
say about you.

3735
02:11:50,010 --> 02:11:53,650
they're going to

3736
02:11:50,610 --> 02:11:53,650
(Endo Father) Great job all!!

3737
02:11:54,110 --> 02:11:56,310
The key.

3738
02:11:56,350 --> 02:11:59,450
Treasure box found

3739
02:11:57,250 --> 02:12:00,180
I found something that has to with the key.

3740
02:12:00,580 --> 02:12:02,650
The five find a new key

3741
02:12:02,850 --> 02:12:04,650
and go back to Matsumoto.

3742
02:12:05,550 --> 02:12:08,050
We’ve come to save you!!

3743
02:12:08,450 --> 02:12:10,650
Hurry, hurry!!

3744
02:12:09,650 --> 02:12:10,580
This’ll work.

3745
02:12:12,980 --> 02:12:13,750
Oh, this way.

3746
02:12:16,180 --> 02:12:16,880
It looks wrong from the beginning.

3747
02:12:16,880 --> 02:12:19,450
It looks wrong from the beginning.

3748
02:12:19,450 --> 02:12:20,450
Come on.

3749
02:12:20,580 --> 02:12:21,750
At least it goes in, right?

3750
02:12:22,050 --> 02:12:24,150
This definitely won’t go in.

3751
02:12:25,050 --> 02:12:25,780
It's wrong.

3752
02:12:26,150 --> 02:12:27,850
The last one was already too large.

3753
02:12:29,750 --> 02:12:31,350
I guess it’s no good.

3754
02:12:31,350 --> 02:12:31,880
Seriously?

3755
02:12:31,880 --> 02:12:32,450
No good.

3756
02:12:32,450 --> 02:12:34,380
There's more of this.

3757
02:12:36,150 --> 02:12:38,850
This was quite long, too.

3758
02:12:52,380 --> 02:12:54,350
It's getting to this stage, now.

3759
02:12:56,350 --> 02:12:59,110
She licked…

3760
02:13:00,310 --> 02:13:02,010
She’s saying, “Caress me.”

3761
02:13:02,250 --> 02:13:04,110
She licked…

3762
02:13:06,910 --> 02:13:09,210
She licked my nose...

3763
02:13:11,110 --> 02:13:11,910
Will you hurry up!!  Seriously!!

3764
02:13:11,910 --> 02:13:13,750
Will you hurry up!!  Seriously!!

3765
02:13:14,910 --> 02:13:17,810
50 minutes after the start

3766
02:13:18,810 --> 02:13:22,550
The shadow of an oni sneaks up from behind

3767
02:13:19,010 --> 02:13:20,150
From behind the five...

3768
02:13:21,150 --> 02:13:22,550
the shadow of an oni...

3769
02:13:26,810 --> 02:13:28,150
I couldn’t tell at all.

3770
02:13:28,250 --> 02:13:28,810
What, what?

3771
02:13:28,880 --> 02:13:30,180
Hamada: “Hattoshite! Good”*

3772
02:13:28,880 --> 02:13:36,480
*Note: “Hattoshite! Good" (Gasp! and then Good) is a 1980 pop song by Tahara Toshihiko.

3773
02:13:32,580 --> 02:13:33,510
What do you want?

3774
02:13:33,980 --> 02:13:35,780
What’s going on?

3775
02:13:35,980 --> 02:13:37,910
What is that?

3776
02:13:38,580 --> 02:13:39,680
What do you want?

3777
02:13:40,780 --> 02:13:44,480
A hat* with a massive load of firecrackers

3778
02:13:40,780 --> 02:13:47,480
*Note: The Japanese transliteration of the English word "hat" is "hatto."  Tahara's song title "Hattoshite! Good" thus becomes a pun, meaning "Put on a hat! Good."

3779
02:13:41,080 --> 02:13:43,210
That was the sound.

3780
02:13:45,110 --> 02:13:47,610
This was crazy.

3781
02:14:03,130 --> 02:14:05,000
Wait, what is this!!

3782
02:14:10,830 --> 02:14:12,930
Stay still!!

3783
02:14:16,500 --> 02:14:25,730
*Note: The music playing in the background is from “Hattoshite! Good.”

3784
02:14:51,100 --> 02:14:57,300
This was done under the guidance of a professional

3785
02:14:57,330 --> 02:14:59,130
This is bad.

3786
02:14:59,130 --> 02:15:01,500
This is bad.

3787
02:15:02,250 --> 02:15:04,750
Your voice is gone.

3788
02:15:04,750 --> 02:15:06,680
Your voice is gone.  Your voice.

3789
02:15:07,250 --> 02:15:09,950
The surveillance experiment has passed 60 minutes.

3790
02:15:10,380 --> 02:15:13,680
Further onis are added

3791
02:15:10,780 --> 02:15:13,680
Onis will be increased.

3792
02:15:14,150 --> 02:15:15,180
It’s gotta be somewhere.

3793
02:15:15,750 --> 02:15:17,180
It has to be, or else it’d be silly.

3794
02:15:17,680 --> 02:15:18,080
What is it?

3795
02:15:18,150 --> 02:15:21,610
There’s one there.

3796
02:15:23,510 --> 02:15:25,450
“Danger."For positionnnnnnnnnnn

3797
02:15:25,380 --> 02:15:26,450
It says "Danger."

3798
02:15:25,450 --> 02:16:28,950
Danger

3799
02:15:28,080 --> 02:15:29,980
Stop, stop, seriously no.

3800
02:15:29,980 --> 02:15:31,050
Seriously, no.

3801
02:15:31,050 --> 02:15:34,680
Stop!!

3802
02:15:35,080 --> 02:15:35,650
I don't want this.

3803
02:15:35,650 --> 02:15:36,580
That's really scary.

3804
02:15:36,580 --> 02:15:39,050
It says “Danger”!!

3805
02:15:38,080 --> 02:15:39,050
Really scary.

3806
02:15:39,050 --> 02:15:40,150
It says “Danger.”

3807
02:15:40,150 --> 02:15:41,980
It’s the first time they’re being so clear about it.

3808
02:15:42,350 --> 02:15:46,450
Tanaka got cau—ght!

3809
02:15:42,650 --> 02:15:45,450
“Danger” has gotta be a bad one.

3810
02:15:46,250 --> 02:15:47,350
How is it dangerous?

3811
02:15:48,550 --> 02:15:52,180
Yama-chan, you’re pissing me off.

3812
02:15:49,010 --> 02:15:51,910
You’re always betraying people.  That’s why this is happening to you.

3813
02:15:50,610 --> 02:15:52,410
That is right.

3814
02:15:52,680 --> 02:15:56,710
You’re always betraying people, that’s why you’re getting punished.

3815
02:15:55,280 --> 02:15:57,110
That is right.

3816
02:15:57,410 --> 02:15:57,780
“Danger.  Do not enter,” it says.

3817
02:15:57,780 --> 02:15:59,910
“Danger.  Do not enter,” it says.

3818
02:15:59,980 --> 02:16:01,810
There’s no way this’ll turn out well.

3819
02:16:01,980 --> 02:16:03,550
What’s gonna happen?

3820
02:16:03,550 --> 02:16:05,550
The hood?

3821
02:16:06,850 --> 02:16:07,780
No way.

3822
02:16:08,050 --> 02:16:08,850
You’re kidding.

3823
02:16:09,110 --> 02:16:10,880
That’s why it says “Danger.”

3824
02:16:14,150 --> 02:16:16,550
Hold on a second.  Hold on...

3825
02:16:16,550 --> 02:16:18,280
This is a joke, right?

3826
02:16:20,380 --> 02:16:21,080
I mean, this isn’t ready-made equipment.

3827
02:16:21,080 --> 02:16:22,680
I mean, this isn’t ready-made equipment.

3828
02:16:22,380 --> 02:16:23,180
Right.

3829
02:16:22,680 --> 02:16:24,080
It’s an original.  The staff just made it themselves.

3830
02:16:24,080 --> 02:16:26,080
It’s an original.  The staff just made it themselves.

3831
02:16:25,080 --> 02:16:26,080
Right.

3832
02:16:26,380 --> 02:16:28,080
Pahaha.  I'm scared.

3833
02:16:29,510 --> 02:16:30,510
Whoa!!  Seriously?

3834
02:16:30,510 --> 02:16:32,510
Whoa!!  Seriously?

3835
02:16:32,510 --> 02:16:35,910
I’m sorry!!

3836
02:16:34,250 --> 02:16:35,810
What do you mean “I’m sorry”?

3837
02:16:35,910 --> 02:16:37,610
I apologize!!

3838
02:17:46,950 --> 02:17:48,610
The ground shuddered.

3839
02:17:47,310 --> 02:17:48,750
That freaked me out.

3840
02:17:50,110 --> 02:17:55,010
This was done under the guidance of a professional

3841
02:17:56,480 --> 02:17:57,510
Tanaka?

3842
02:17:57,510 --> 02:17:59,210
He’s crying!!

3843
02:17:59,210 --> 02:18:00,910
You can’t even tell what the color of his face is.

3844
02:18:01,780 --> 02:18:03,780
Was it that scary?

3845
02:18:04,280 --> 02:18:06,010
He’s crying!!

3846
02:18:06,310 --> 02:18:08,480
I apologize for everything before.

3847
02:18:09,480 --> 02:18:11,880
You were acting like an ass, that’s why you got what was coming, you see?

3848
02:18:11,880 --> 02:18:15,280
This is messed up!!

3849
02:18:15,280 --> 02:18:15,980
It’s Fujiwara.

3850
02:18:16,180 --> 02:18:17,480
There's no key anywhere.

3851
02:18:17,550 --> 02:18:18,350
There's no key.

3852
02:18:18,350 --> 02:18:20,450
About the key that everyone's looking for,

3853
02:18:20,750 --> 02:18:21,550
it was in my… my pocket the whole time.

3854
02:18:21,550 --> 02:18:22,180
it was in my… my pocket the whole time.

3855
02:18:22,180 --> 02:18:24,010
it was in my… my pocket the whole time.

3856
02:18:22,950 --> 02:18:24,050
What was that?

3857
02:18:24,450 --> 02:18:26,450
He stuttered.

3858
02:18:25,880 --> 02:18:28,380
And that’s where you stutter?

3859
02:18:30,650 --> 02:18:32,550
Let’s go, then.

3860
02:18:33,880 --> 02:18:36,550
What were we here for?

3861
02:18:35,750 --> 02:18:36,550
Answer Toshi-chan.

3862
02:18:37,780 --> 02:18:39,450
There was a huge explosion.

3863
02:18:40,650 --> 02:18:42,680
Hurry.  Hurry.

3864
02:18:43,280 --> 02:18:47,580
It opened, it opened.  It opened!

3865
02:18:43,280 --> 02:18:50,150
Experiment Complete

3866
02:18:51,410 --> 02:18:53,880
Everyone, there’s still a lot to do.

3867
02:18:53,880 --> 02:18:57,180
Don’t say that, geez.

3868
02:18:58,880 --> 02:19:00,580
After the shock of the experiment,

3869
02:19:01,280 --> 02:19:03,480
the five return to the prison.

3870
02:19:05,110 --> 02:19:08,510
Okay, everyone.  For now, wait here again.

3871
02:19:08,510 --> 02:19:10,180
Something’s written there.

3872
02:19:10,180 --> 02:19:12,310
Something’s written there.

3873
02:19:13,780 --> 02:19:18,050
The contents

3874

The terror of the desk drawer pranks, again

3875
02:19:18,080 --> 02:19:23,080
Give us a break.  We already did that so much.

3876
02:19:21,710 --> 02:19:22,580
Whatever.

3877
02:19:26,180 --> 02:19:28,180
Well, yeah, every time it’s like this.

3878
02:19:29,710 --> 02:19:30,980
Are we required to give in to this?

3879
02:19:30,980 --> 02:19:32,780
Are we required to give in to this?

3880
02:19:32,780 --> 02:19:35,180
We have to open them at some point, right?

3881
02:19:36,280 --> 02:19:37,980
Should we go from here?

3882
02:19:37,980 --> 02:19:41,010
Starting from Endo this time

3883
02:19:38,980 --> 02:19:39,610
I’m going to go, OK?

3884
02:19:39,910 --> 02:19:40,910
Starting with Shozo.

3885
02:19:41,010 --> 02:19:41,680
Yes.  Here I go.

3886
02:19:41,680 --> 02:19:42,080
Let’s go.

3887
02:19:43,380 --> 02:19:45,680
There it is, right from the get-go!!

3888
02:19:44,280 --> 02:19:45,680
There it is.

3889
02:19:45,680 --> 02:19:54,110
A Mystery Envelope

3890
02:19:46,310 --> 02:19:49,050
Oh, there it is.

3891
02:19:50,150 --> 02:19:54,110
This, oh, geez.  What is this?

3892
02:19:51,710 --> 02:19:54,110
We’ve seen this kind of thing before.

3893
02:19:54,110 --> 02:19:56,010
“We know everything,” it says.

3894
02:19:56,010 --> 02:19:56,710
Whoa, whoa, I’m just

3895
02:19:56,710 --> 02:19:58,510

3897

I seriously hate these envelopes.  Seriously, I…

3898

I seriously hate these envelopes.  Seriously, I…

3899
02:20:04,350 --> 02:20:09,780
This, really—Endo has said that recently there’s seriously been nothing happening—is what I’ve been told.

3900
02:20:04,350 --> 02:20:14,980
2 years ago, this envelope led to the exposure of a secret date between Endo and a woman

3901
02:20:10,150 --> 02:20:11,650
There’s seriously nothing happening.

3902
02:20:10,650 --> 02:20:14,980
So if there actually was something going on, I really just can't like you as a person anymore.

3903
02:20:14,980 --> 02:20:16,850
I have nothing like that.

3904
02:20:16,850 --> 02:20:18,580
Nothing.

3905
02:20:18,580 --> 02:20:20,480
Seriously, nothing.

3906
02:20:20,550 --> 02:20:22,150
Ser…iously nothing.

3907
02:20:22,850 --> 02:20:26,750
If you’re confident, then…

3908
02:20:25,310 --> 02:20:26,750
...then you're innocent.

02:23:31,150 --> 02:23:33,250
I was safe there, surely?!

4012
02:23:36,480 --> 02:23:38,180
I hate this!!

4013
02:23:37,580 --> 02:23:39,880
That OGO sound just killed me...

4014
02:23:38,880 --> 02:23:40,650
I'm surprised you remembered that!

4015
02:23:41,650 --> 02:23:43,450
Even I didn't remember that.

4016
02:23:45,050 --> 02:23:46,280
I will never be able to forget that

4017
02:23:46,080 --> 02:23:47,250
Oh shit man...

4018
02:23:47,610 --> 02:23:49,380
You didn't do anything though right?

4019
02:23:47,780 --> 02:23:49,710
I didn't do anything

4020
02:23:49,380 --> 02:23:51,610
Just open the first page

4021
02:23:51,610 --> 02:23:53,950
Then we will know more

4022
02:23:53,550 --> 02:23:55,210
This doesn't have anything to do with your story...

4023
02:23:55,210 --> 02:23:56,350
That's something else...

4024
02:23:55,610 --> 02:23:56,950
What?!

4025
02:23:56,410 --> 02:23:57,210

A beautiful woman??

02:24:11,050 --> 02:24:12,450
Are you serious?

4045
02:24:11,950 --> 02:24:13,950
There's no escape route now...

4046
02:24:13,950 --> 02:24:15,910
Wakki really did that?

4047
02:24:16,810 --> 02:24:19,910
Can we open it?.. I guess we have to now...

4048
02:24:19,710 --> 02:24:22,510
Yeah, you have no choice, there's a pen knife there for you as well.

4049
02:24:21,410 --> 02:24:22,450
You didn't do anything right?..

4050
02:24:22,480 --> 02:24:25,210
Monnday got you

4051
02:24:22,480 --> 02:24:25,210

4052
02:24:23,810 --> 02:24:24,780
Monnday...

4053
02:24:25,210 --> 02:24:26,710
Monnday?

4054
02:24:28,610 --> 02:24:29,580
I've cut it open

4055
02:24:29,380 --> 02:24:31,180
Wow you're good at that

02:24:33,680 --> 02:24:35,280

It's just your bloody Mum and Dad!!

4063
02:24:49,780 --> 02:24:51,180
I'm just in disbelief

4064
02:24:51,180 --> 02:24:53,880
We are both Endo's I guess but...

4065
02:24:54,110 --> 02:24:57,210
A late night Yakiniku (grilled meat)  date apparently

4066
02:24:58,710 --> 02:25:00,150
Wait, what the hell is this?

4067
02:25:00,150 --> 02:25:03,550
Super exclusive. Endo Toshihide and his wife Kiyomi's Yakiniku date.

4068
02:25:03,910 --> 02:25:04,810
Hehehe

4069
02:25:04,810 --> 02:25:06,710
So my Mum and Dad were...

4070
02:25:06,510 --> 02:25:08,710
You could totally imagine them like this

4071
02:25:07,610 --> 02:25:10,510
You're right, you can imagine them.

4072
02:25:11,310 --> 02:25:13,110
But I'm kind of happy...

4073
02:25:12,510 --> 02:25:14,010
Yeah, me too.

4074
02:25:13,510 --> 02:25:15,110
Well yeah, seriously I haven't...

4075
02:25:15,110 --> 02:25:17,110
I have seriously done nothing wrong!

4076
02:25:16,050 --> 02:25:17,650
Yeah I know, right?

4077
02:25:18,150 --> 02:25:23,610
I thought Endo's Dad was

4078
02:25:20,650 --> 02:25:23,610
cheating on your Mum or something...

4079
02:25:23,850 --> 02:25:24,650
This is your Mum right?...

4080
02:25:24,310 --> 02:25:26,050
Yes yes, that's my Mum

4081
02:25:25,710 --> 02:25:28,510
Both father and son...

4082
02:25:26,710 --> 02:25:28,510
Yeah if we both did that kind of thing...

4083
02:25:28,510 --> 02:25:31,480
That would just be ridiculous

4084
02:25:29,680 --> 02:25:31,480
You're just normally laughing...

4085
02:25:35,280 --> 02:25:36,680
Nothing you can do...

4086
02:25:36,480 --> 02:25:37,780
I'm so happy though...

4087
02:25:37,810 --> 02:25:38,780
Yeah, seriously..

4088
02:25:38,780 --> 02:25:41,080
I'm relieved

4089
02:25:39,980 --> 02:25:41,910
I'm relieved as well...

4090
02:25:41,110 --> 02:25:42,610
I can trust you again.

4091
02:25:43,410 --> 02:25:44,980
That's great.

4092
02:25:46,810 --> 02:25:49,480
That was like a gun salute

4093
02:25:48,380 --> 02:25:49,510
You're right.

4094
02:25:49,510 --> 02:25:51,680
Like seriously man, seriously..

4095
02:25:51,680 --> 02:25:53,080
I'm so happy...

4096
02:25:52,180 --> 02:25:54,510
This is not me, not me.

4097
02:25:53,550 --> 02:25:55,950
I was about to lose faith in humanity there.

4098
02:25:55,080 --> 02:25:56,410
It's just about Mum and Dad...

4099
02:25:56,410 --> 02:25:57,780
Okay, I'm going to open mine up...

4100
02:26:02,580 --> 02:26:04,110
Huh, why did it do that?...

4101
02:26:03,180 --> 02:26:06,010
Can you not even bloody open a drawer normally?...

4102
02:26:04,810 --> 02:26:06,680
No no, it's just...

4103
02:26:07,080 --> 02:26:07,880
They're made so you can open them easily...

4104
02:26:08,780 --> 02:26:10,280
There it is, another locker key

4105
02:26:10,450 --> 02:26:13,050
Mysterious Key (Number 7)

4106
02:26:11,450 --> 02:26:12,350
Locker...

4107
02:26:13,250 --> 02:26:14,980
Oh just one

4108
02:26:14,350 --> 02:26:15,780
Oh, it's the locker there...

4109
02:26:15,180 --> 02:26:16,450
Number 7

4110
02:26:16,550 --> 02:26:20,750
Locker Number 7

4111
02:26:16,750 --> 02:26:17,850
Let's go for it!

4112
02:26:18,750 --> 02:26:19,750
Over there

4113
02:26:19,650 --> 02:26:21,980
This is a bit big, no?

4114
02:26:22,080 --> 02:26:23,450
Yeah, it's pretty big.

4115
02:26:38,500 --> 02:26:39,850
Hold on!

4116
02:26:39,210 --> 02:26:40,510
It's back again!

4117
02:26:41,110 --> 02:26:42,710
I knew it...

4118
02:26:44,750 --> 02:26:49,980
2nd face art of Hamada

4119
02:26:50,710 --> 02:26:52,410
He actually does this face...

4120
02:26:52,910 --> 02:26:55,310
This is a different expression from before!

4121
02:26:54,710 --> 02:27:02,810
Face Art 1

4122
02:26:54,710 --> 02:27:02,810
Face Art 2

4123
02:26:55,310 --> 02:26:57,610
It's got a totally new expression.

4124
02:26:58,010 --> 02:26:59,710
This one isn't smiling like before.

4125
02:27:03,080 --> 02:27:05,780
He does that face from time to time...

4126
02:27:04,780 --> 02:27:05,380
Yup.

4127
02:27:07,080 --> 02:27:08,480
He does do that face...

4128
02:27:08,150 --> 02:27:10,650
Like when it really stinks

4129
02:27:12,550 --> 02:27:13,650
That's just amazing

4130
02:27:13,950 --> 02:27:15,450
Okay, we are done here.

4131
02:27:15,350 --> 02:27:17,650
If we're doing it in order...

4132
02:27:16,250 --> 02:27:18,750
Tanaka, can you just turn it the other way?...

4133
02:27:17,850 --> 02:27:19,050
Yeah, please do...

4134
02:27:18,750 --> 02:27:21,080
I wonder who  made that?

4135
02:27:21,080 --> 02:27:23,880
What would you do if that

4136
02:27:21,880 --> 02:27:23,880
was created like 20 years or something?

4137
02:27:23,880 --> 02:27:24,880
so the real thing's face just keeps heading towards that direction

4138
02:27:24,880 --> 02:27:26,780
so the real thing's face just keeps
heading towards that direction

4139
02:27:33,910 --> 02:27:35,580
He screwed up!

4140
02:27:35,980 --> 02:27:37,180
Something's there

4141
02:27:36,780 --> 02:27:39,180
What is that?

4142
02:27:37,680 --> 02:27:39,580
There's something there...

4143
02:27:40,680 --> 02:27:41,880
A warning?...

4144
02:27:41,880 --> 02:27:43,080
Perhaps...

4145
02:27:43,650 --> 02:27:47,580
A mysterious envelope

4146
02:27:48,680 --> 02:27:50,780
Okay I am all done

4147
02:27:51,780 --> 02:27:53,180
So this envelope...

4148
02:27:53,280 --> 02:27:55,880
This is the question...

4149
02:27:58,280 --> 02:28:00,680
There's a question I think

4150
02:27:59,780 --> 02:28:01,380
No, it's not.

4151
02:28:00,680 --> 02:28:03,380
No, it says

4152
02:28:00,680 --> 02:28:03,380
OK on it

4153
02:28:02,980 --> 02:28:04,080
I just saw, it says OK

4154
02:28:05,980 --> 02:28:08,180
The 'For ten minutes, I can laugh' card

4155
02:28:06,280 --> 02:28:13,710
can laugh for 10 minutes

4156
02:28:06,280 --> 02:28:13,710
The person who holds this card

4157
02:28:06,280 --> 02:28:21,580
10 minutes

4158
02:28:06,280 --> 02:28:21,580
OK to laugh Card

4159
02:28:06,280 --> 02:28:21,580
Rule

4160
02:28:08,180 --> 02:28:10,380
The 'For ten minutes, I can laugh' card...

4161
02:28:10,380 --> 02:28:12,780
If I use this card, only I can

4162
02:28:12,780 --> 02:28:13,880
laugh for 10 minutes

4163
02:28:13,710 --> 02:28:21,610
When you choose to use it, you have 10 minutes

4164
02:28:13,710 --> 02:28:21,610
where you can laugh without punishment

4165
02:28:13,910 --> 02:28:17,810
When you want to use this card, you must state that you want to use this card.

4166
02:28:18,710 --> 02:28:20,010
What the hell is this?

4167
02:28:20,010 --> 02:28:21,010
What does that mean?

4168
02:28:20,710 --> 02:28:22,210
I see..

4169
02:28:21,810 --> 02:28:24,610
So from the moment you state you're using the card...

4170
02:28:22,610 --> 02:28:24,910
So whenever he chooses to, he can laugh for 10 minutes..

4171
02:28:24,610 --> 02:28:27,310
That's such a good card

4172
02:28:25,910 --> 02:28:27,610
Well yeah, it's awesome.

4173
02:28:27,310 --> 02:28:28,980
You can just act totally normal

4174
02:28:28,980 --> 02:28:29,580
You don't need it yet, to use it?

4175
02:28:29,580 --> 02:28:31,750
You don't need it yet, to use it?

4176
02:28:31,750 --> 02:28:34,480
Well we're not really in that bad a situation.

4177
02:28:34,850 --> 02:28:36,350
That is so awesome.

4178
02:28:36,150 --> 02:28:37,650
You're so lucky...

4179
02:28:37,050 --> 02:28:39,350
Okay Yama-chan

4180
02:28:40,550 --> 02:28:43,110
Yama-chan has one too...

4181
02:28:41,110 --> 02:28:43,110
There's similar envelope in his drawer too

4182
02:28:43,110 --> 02:28:46,210
Mysterious envelope

4183
02:28:43,610 --> 02:28:45,610
You guys have lucky drawers...

4184
02:28:44,510 --> 02:28:46,710
What the hell is this, man?

4185
02:28:46,710 --> 02:28:48,210
I'm lucky this time...

4186
02:28:49,010 --> 02:28:50,510
AH!

4187
02:28:50,910 --> 02:28:51,610
What??

4188
02:28:52,710 --> 02:28:54,210
I got another Notebook

4189
02:28:53,050 --> 02:28:57,210
Secret Escape book- Number 2

4190
02:28:53,710 --> 02:28:54,810
It says Part 2

4191
02:28:57,510 --> 02:28:58,710
Nothing here... Nope!

4192
02:28:58,710 --> 02:28:59,810
Nothing here... Nope!

4193
02:29:01,580 --> 02:29:04,580
I'm going to open the card first then

4194
02:29:05,180 --> 02:29:07,680
10 minutes casual chat card

4195
02:29:07,550 --> 02:29:14,780
10 minutes

4196
02:29:07,550 --> 02:29:14,780
Rule

4197
02:29:07,550 --> 02:29:14,780
The person who holds this card

4198
02:29:07,550 --> 02:29:14,780
can chat casually for 10 minutes

4199
02:29:07,550 --> 02:29:14,780
casual chat card

4200
02:29:07,680 --> 02:29:10,480
The person who uses this card can for 10 minutes...

4201
02:29:10,480 --> 02:29:11,580
speak casually.

4202
02:29:11,580 --> 02:29:13,080
I see...

4203
02:29:13,280 --> 02:29:15,080
It's like before...

4204
02:29:15,080 --> 02:29:17,180
You need to think when to use it

4205
02:29:15,780 --> 02:29:17,580
That's good

4206
02:29:17,280 --> 02:29:18,180
That's cool.

4207
02:29:19,780 --> 02:29:23,080
Let's open the book last

4208
02:29:21,580 --> 02:29:22,880
You're right.

4209
02:29:22,880 --> 02:29:23,980
Tanaka, you go.

4210
02:29:23,980 --> 02:29:27,580
He might have something like you guys too...

4211
02:29:27,280 --> 02:29:28,850
Oh man, there's another one

4212
02:29:27,850 --> 02:29:28,850
There it is...

4213
02:29:28,850 --> 02:29:32,980
One mysterious DVD

4214
02:29:29,850 --> 02:29:31,050
Again?

4215
02:29:30,150 --> 02:29:33,650
I did think there would be more to be honest.

4216
02:29:33,710 --> 02:29:36,810
Every year there are 2 DVD's to be fair...

4217
02:29:37,050 --> 02:29:40,250
So you probably won't have anything

4218
02:29:37,050 --> 02:29:40,250
in the other drawers right?

4219
02:29:39,950 --> 02:29:40,950
Yeah probably

4220
02:29:40,350 --> 02:29:41,750
Tanaka just has a DVD probably...

4221
02:29:40,950 --> 02:29:41,950
AH!!

4222
02:29:42,250 --> 02:29:43,550
Wait, what, you're kidding me!

4223
02:29:42,910 --> 02:29:46,010
Mysterious envelope

4224
02:29:43,210 --> 02:29:45,210
I had one too

4225
02:29:46,510 --> 02:29:48,610
So far, there's been a 'Okay to laugh' and 'Okay to speak casually'...

4226
02:29:48,610 --> 02:29:50,010
What else is there?...

4227
02:29:49,210 --> 02:29:50,810
What's the next card going to be?

4228
02:29:52,110 --> 02:29:53,910
That's so unfair...

4229
02:29:53,250 --> 02:29:55,810
I will open it now!!

4230
02:29:54,710 --> 02:29:56,110
We'll watch the DVD later

4231
02:29:56,210 --> 02:29:57,310
Punishment...

4232
02:29:57,310 --> 02:29:59,110
It's a 'Let off from punishment' card!

4233
02:29:58,880 --> 02:30:10,980
Let off card

4234
02:29:58,880 --> 02:30:10,980
Punishment

4235
02:29:58,880 --> 02:30:10,980
Rule

4236
02:29:58,880 --> 02:30:10,980
The person who holds this card

4237
02:29:58,880 --> 02:30:10,980
can be let off from being punished

4238
02:29:59,080 --> 02:30:01,180
That's such a good card!

4239
02:30:01,280 --> 02:30:03,180
That's the best card!

4240
02:30:02,380 --> 02:30:03,680
That's such a good card!

4241
02:30:03,680 --> 02:30:06,280
If this card is used, only the person holding the card

4242
02:30:06,280 --> 02:30:08,280
can be let off from being punished. When you want to use the card

4243
02:30:08,280 --> 02:30:11,280
you must state that you will use the card.

4244
02:30:11,850 --> 02:30:14,410
That is just so good!

4245
02:30:12,850 --> 02:30:14,650
This is amazing

4246
02:30:14,750 --> 02:30:17,350
So you're protected from Thai Kicks and stuff...

4247
02:30:15,050 --> 02:30:16,350
Why not my draw....

4248
02:30:16,250 --> 02:30:17,750
You're right!

4249
02:30:17,350 --> 02:30:20,210
This is a reallylucky card to have

4250
02:30:20,850 --> 02:30:22,050
My card is not eventhat good after all...

4251
02:30:22,050 --> 02:30:23,180
My card is not even that good after all...

4252
02:30:23,450 --> 02:30:25,650
But that is also an awesome card

4253
02:30:25,650 --> 02:30:28,350
But I don't know when it's good to use it though!

4254
02:30:28,450 --> 02:30:30,950
Like I don't know when it's best to use it

4255
02:30:30,450 --> 02:30:32,050
You'll be able to decide that though

4256
02:30:31,550 --> 02:30:32,550
I don't really like get the point of this card

4257
02:30:32,550 --> 02:30:34,650
I don't really likeget the point of this card

4258
02:30:36,950 --> 02:30:38,450
I don't understandat all

4259
02:30:38,450 --> 02:30:41,750
I'm going to use it!!

4260
02:30:39,650 --> 02:30:41,750
You're speaking casually to me right now!

4261
02:30:43,150 --> 02:30:48,110
I would like to activate the '10 minutes casual chat'

4262
02:30:45,150 --> 02:30:48,110
card as of now!!

4263
02:30:48,110 --> 02:30:49,110
As of now, you are okay to speak casually for 10 minutes

4264
02:30:48,110 --> 02:30:56,210
Announcer

4265
02:30:49,110 --> 02:30:52,310
The 10 minutes 'casual chat' card has been activated

4266
02:30:52,410 --> 02:30:53,210
As of now

4267
02:30:53,210 --> 02:30:54,310
you are okay to speak casually

4268
02:30:54,310 --> 02:30:56,210
for 10 minutes

4269
02:30:56,410 --> 02:31:00,010
10 minutes casual chat

4270
02:30:58,010 --> 02:30:59,710
Well it's only really useful when speaking to Downtown

4271
02:31:00,210 --> 02:32:05,810
Hosei casual chat card activated

4272
02:31:00,250 --> 02:31:02,580
You speak casually

4273
02:31:00,250 --> 02:31:02,580
to the Coccorico's anyway

4274
02:31:02,580 --> 02:31:04,050
You're right

4275
02:31:03,280 --> 02:31:04,680
That doesn't change

4276
02:31:04,050 --> 02:31:06,150
Yeah I know that...

4277
02:31:06,150 --> 02:31:07,950
Shall we open the how to escape notebook now?

4278
02:31:07,950 --> 02:31:10,610
WHY THE HELL!!?

4279
02:31:11,410 --> 02:31:13,780
casual chat doesn't mean like...

4280
02:31:13,780 --> 02:31:18,450
you can attack us or something, you know?

4281
02:31:20,980 --> 02:31:23,680
Questioning is a bit different to that...

4282
02:31:23,080 --> 02:31:24,480
Oh, is it?

4283
02:31:24,180 --> 02:31:25,580
Like 'WHY THE HELL' is just...

4284
02:31:24,680 --> 02:31:25,780
That's wrong

4285
02:31:25,380 --> 02:31:28,480
That's just weird, we didn't say anything funny or strange

4286
02:31:28,480 --> 02:31:30,080
You can say like 'Oh yeah, you're right'

4287
02:31:29,580 --> 02:31:30,880
Yeah man, exactly.

4288
02:31:31,080 --> 02:31:33,180
Oh, so I should talk to you like...

4289
02:31:34,950 --> 02:31:40,310
I should just talk to you like

4290
02:31:37,350 --> 02:31:37,950
when I talk to the Cocoricos, yeah?

4291
02:31:37,950 --> 02:31:40,310
when I talk to the Cocoricos, yeah?

4292
02:31:40,550 --> 02:31:41,550
Just like normal casual...

4293
02:31:42,210 --> 02:31:44,450
You'd prefer to watch the DVD

4294
02:31:42,210 --> 02:31:44,450
last right?

4295
02:31:44,450 --> 02:31:46,980
so let's open the  how to escape Notebook first...

4296
02:31:45,380 --> 02:31:46,280
I see...

4297
02:31:45,880 --> 02:31:46,880
You're right there...

4298
02:31:46,980 --> 02:31:49,110
Shall we go for it?

4299
02:31:47,750 --> 02:31:49,110
Maybe, yeah...

4300
02:31:49,110 --> 02:31:51,510
Do you mind if I have a cheeky peek, yeah?

4301
02:31:53,610 --> 02:31:57,310
This is just a huge problem for me and Hamada...

4302
02:31:58,050 --> 02:31:59,750
There's just an uncomfortable feeling right now.

4303
02:31:59,050 --> 02:32:00,250
You're right...

4304
02:32:00,850 --> 02:32:02,750
That uncomfortable feeling's going to make us laugh...

4305
02:32:05,750 --> 02:32:07,050
Hey

4306
02:32:07,050 --> 02:32:07,750
It went in just now

4307
02:32:08,550 --> 02:32:10,250
It went in

4308
02:32:10,250 --> 02:32:11,250
He was doing the "guts pose" just now

4309
02:32:11,250 --> 02:32:11,950
Yes

4310
02:32:12,710 --> 02:32:14,410
Seriously?

4311
02:32:14,410 --> 02:32:15,410
That's annoying

4312
02:32:15,810 --> 02:32:16,910
We won't watch

4313
02:32:16,910 --> 02:32:17,410
Why not?

4314
02:32:18,110 --> 02:32:19,110
What do you mean why not?

4315
02:32:18,710 --> 02:32:19,710
Just go look

4316
02:32:24,910 --> 02:32:26,810
That should be safe!

4317
02:32:26,810 --> 02:32:28,610
This is unfair to Downtown

4318
02:32:28,310 --> 02:32:29,510
This is unfair to Downtown!

4319
02:32:29,510 --> 02:32:30,210
Yes I agree

4320
02:32:30,210 --> 02:32:32,210
Definitely!

4321
02:32:32,210 --> 02:32:33,910
That is uncomfortable

4322
02:32:37,910 --> 02:32:40,080
Why are you high-fiving ?

4323
02:32:40,910 --> 02:32:43,010
A high-five is very cruel

4324
02:32:43,210 --> 02:32:44,410
A high five isn't good

4325
02:32:44,110 --> 02:32:45,110
They did a high-five

4326
02:32:45,110 --> 02:32:46,010
Why?

4327
02:32:46,410 --> 02:32:49,410
When your elders were getting beaten, you did a high-five

4328
02:32:48,110 --> 02:32:51,010
Those kinds of things happen sometimes

4329
02:32:54,210 --> 02:32:56,710
Hey, read this

4330
02:32:57,610 --> 02:33:22,010
Secret Prison escape note

4331
02:32:58,210 --> 02:33:00,410
To whoever picked up the note,

4332
02:33:00,410 --> 02:33:05,410
this took ten years for me to complete.

4333
02:33:05,410 --> 02:33:08,910
To show the secret path to the outside of the prison.

4334
02:33:08,910 --> 02:33:14,210
To whoever picked up the note, quickly use the secret path to escape from the prison.

4335
02:33:14,210 --> 02:33:14,910
Look, it's the same as before

4336
02:33:14,910 --> 02:33:16,410
The King of Escaped Prisoners in Heisei

4337
02:33:17,310 --> 02:33:18,410
It said this before

4338
02:33:19,410 --> 02:33:19,910
It had it

4339
02:33:19,910 --> 02:33:21,410
Ah, yes it did

4340
02:33:23,910 --> 02:33:24,910
It's the same place

4341
02:33:25,310 --> 02:33:26,810
Oh, then it's right there

4342
02:33:25,610 --> 02:33:39,710
Map of the Room

4343
02:33:25,610 --> 02:33:39,710
Open this door to
reach secret passage

4344
02:33:25,610 --> 02:33:39,710
Secret Prison escape note

4345
02:33:28,210 --> 02:33:29,610
Let's go

4346
02:33:29,610 --> 02:33:30,210
Please lead us

4347
02:33:30,810 --> 02:33:33,210
But, the first time we went

4348
02:33:33,510 --> 02:33:34,510
there was nothing there

4349
02:33:35,810 --> 02:33:37,310
We went there

4350
02:33:37,310 --> 02:33:38,510
and stayed there

4351
02:33:38,510 --> 02:33:39,710
We'll go anyway

4352
02:33:41,310 --> 02:33:42,710
Not THERE!

4353
02:33:41,910 --> 02:33:42,710
That's not it

4354
02:33:42,710 --> 02:33:44,610
That hurt

4355
02:33:51,910 --> 02:33:52,910
Of course it's not there

4356
02:33:54,310 --> 02:33:56,610
For one second, I thought "oh it might be there"

4357
02:33:54,710 --> 02:33:56,610
That's what you did before

4358
02:33:56,810 --> 02:33:58,010
Same as before

4359
02:33:57,010 --> 02:33:59,610
Please stop

4360
02:33:58,610 --> 02:33:59,610
It's not that one

4361
02:34:01,710 --> 02:34:04,010
That really huuurts

4362
02:34:05,410 --> 02:34:06,910
Okay, okay

4363
02:34:06,950 --> 02:34:08,450
It was there

4364
02:34:08,450 --> 02:34:09,150
Yes

4365
02:34:11,450 --> 02:34:12,750
Yes, yes, yes, yes

4366
02:34:12,750 --> 02:34:13,450
It's the same

4367
02:34:14,950 --> 02:34:17,750
That led to the bathroom

4368
02:34:18,250 --> 02:34:20,050
It might have changed

4369
02:34:20,050 --> 02:34:21,250
It really might have changed

4370
02:34:22,950 --> 02:34:23,850
Wait for me

4371
02:34:23,850 --> 02:34:24,950
Whoa!

4372
02:34:28,750 --> 02:34:29,550
Oh, again!

4373
02:34:30,750 --> 02:34:32,050
Again

4374
02:34:32,050 --> 02:34:33,550
It's here

4375
02:34:36,750 --> 02:34:37,450
Wait

4376
02:34:38,350 --> 02:34:39,850
It's a good one

4377
02:34:57,500 --> 02:34:58,500
What!?

4378
02:34:58,500 --> 02:35:01,700
A baby and a letter are...

4379
02:34:59,800 --> 02:35:01,300
What?!

4380
02:35:02,000 --> 02:35:05,100
THIS IS TERRIBLE!!

4381
02:35:05,500 --> 02:35:06,800
It changed

4382
02:35:05,800 --> 02:35:08,000
THIS IS TERRIBLE!!!

4383
02:35:07,900 --> 02:35:09,200
Tanaka, you should go check on him

4384
02:35:09,200 --> 02:35:10,100
Wait,

4385
02:35:10,100 --> 02:35:11,200
Is he calling us?

4386
02:35:11,200 --> 02:35:14,100
Is he coming back?

4387
02:35:12,400 --> 02:35:14,200
Hey!!

4388
02:35:14,100 --> 02:35:17,400
You aren't gonna believe this

4389
02:35:15,600 --> 02:35:16,600
What what what?

4390
02:35:17,400 --> 02:35:19,200
A baby...

4391
02:35:20,300 --> 02:35:22,100
A baby!!

4392
02:35:22,100 --> 02:35:25,500
A letter

4393
02:35:25,500 --> 02:35:28,600
The face looks like Hosei-san's face

4394
02:35:27,300 --> 02:35:28,600
It does kind of look similar

4395
02:35:28,000 --> 02:35:29,600
They look similar

4396
02:35:32,610 --> 02:35:33,510
Hold the baby

4397
02:35:33,510 --> 02:35:34,210
Will do

4398
02:35:39,710 --> 02:35:41,010
Do it properly

4399
02:35:41,010 --> 02:35:43,810
Oh sorry sorry sorry

4400
02:35:44,510 --> 02:35:45,510
Oh, like that

4401
02:35:45,610 --> 02:35:48,010
Oh, a totally different reaction

4402
02:35:46,910 --> 02:35:51,950
The baby cheers up when Hosei holds it ❤

4403
02:35:47,610 --> 02:35:48,610
Of course!

4404
02:35:48,650 --> 02:35:51,350
It likes Hosei-san

4405
02:35:51,950 --> 02:35:53,610
Why don't you hold it?

4406
02:35:54,250 --> 02:35:55,250
Can I hold it?

4407
02:35:55,250 --> 02:35:55,950
Yeah sure, but

4408
02:35:56,050 --> 02:35:57,550
the neck is still... you know

4409
02:35:57,250 --> 02:35:58,150
Ahh yes yes yes

4410
02:35:58,250 --> 02:35:59,450
What a shaky head

4411
02:35:59,450 --> 02:36:00,250
Thank you for letting me hold it

4412
02:36:02,050 --> 02:36:04,250
It's crying

4413
02:36:04,250 --> 02:36:05,250
No no no...

4414
02:36:05,250 --> 02:36:06,250
Matsumoto still has a

4415
02:36:06,250 --> 02:36:06,950
young child

4416
02:36:07,350 --> 02:36:08,250
so

4417
02:36:08,650 --> 02:36:10,050
It's crying it's crying

4418
02:36:09,750 --> 02:36:10,950
Ah it cried

4419
02:36:13,950 --> 02:36:15,050
It's okay, it's alright

4420
02:36:16,750 --> 02:36:17,850
That's amazing

4421
02:36:17,350 --> 02:36:23,450
The baby definitely feels better with Hosei ❤

4422
02:36:18,550 --> 02:36:19,750
Do you have a tissue?

4423
02:36:19,750 --> 02:36:20,450
Yes

4424
02:36:21,150 --> 02:36:21,650
Tissue, tissue

4425
02:36:21,650 --> 02:36:22,450
Tissue

4426
02:36:22,450 --> 02:36:23,650
Ah I found one here

4427
02:36:23,650 --> 02:36:25,550
Its nose is running

4428
02:36:25,550 --> 02:36:26,050
Its nose is running

4429
02:36:26,050 --> 02:36:26,650
Its nose is running

4430
02:36:26,650 --> 02:36:28,350
How cute

4431
02:36:30,650 --> 02:36:31,750
How cute

4432
02:36:32,350 --> 02:36:34,450
Isn't it laughing too much?

4433
02:36:41,350 --> 02:36:43,250
It shouldn't be laughing so much

4434
02:36:43,250 --> 02:36:44,250
Hold it

4435
02:36:44,950 --> 02:36:46,550
Even if it is cute...

4436
02:36:46,550 --> 02:36:47,950
Use that tissue

4437
02:36:50,550 --> 02:36:51,050
Ouch

4438
02:36:52,150 --> 02:36:54,150
Ah it's crying a lot

4439
02:36:53,050 --> 02:36:54,150
No no no no

4440
02:36:54,350 --> 02:36:55,050
It's crying

4441
02:36:54,980 --> 02:36:55,680
Boob

4442
02:36:55,680 --> 02:36:56,680
Boob boob

4443
02:37:01,080 --> 02:37:02,180
Nope...

4444
02:37:02,180 --> 02:37:03,080
Nope, nope...

4445
02:37:04,780 --> 02:37:06,080
Here

4446
02:37:07,280 --> 02:37:08,580
Alright

4447
02:37:11,250 --> 02:37:13,650
Matsumoto san, what's written in the letter?

4448
02:37:14,380 --> 02:37:18,380
Wait, just leave it because it's already too loud

4449
02:37:19,680 --> 02:37:21,080
Yeah, let's just put it down

4450
02:37:21,580 --> 02:37:24,080
Hey you, that's enough

4451
02:37:27,880 --> 02:37:30,480
Stop treating it like it's a real baby

4452
02:37:30,480 --> 02:37:32,780
Seriously just put it down!!

4453
02:37:32,980 --> 02:37:33,980
You treat it like it's real

4454
02:37:33,980 --> 02:37:37,280
Whatever, it's fine

4455
02:37:38,980 --> 02:37:40,480
Happy, happy!

4456
02:37:40,480 --> 02:37:42,580
How cute, what a happy baby

4457
02:37:43,180 --> 02:37:44,180
Let's see

4458
02:37:44,110 --> 02:37:55,410
A letter from mother

4459
02:37:44,480 --> 02:37:46,380
To kind-hearted you,

4460
02:37:46,310 --> 02:37:49,210
Please take care of this child for a while.

4461
02:37:49,210 --> 02:37:50,510
He is a boy.

4462
02:37:50,510 --> 02:37:53,110
Please name him and treat him lovingly.

4463
02:37:55,410 --> 02:37:57,410
I want to name him...

4464
02:37:57,410 --> 02:38:00,210
Akio.

4465
02:37:59,210 --> 02:37:59,910
Akio?

4466
02:37:59,910 --> 02:38:00,610
Akio

4467
02:38:00,610 --> 02:38:04,110
Why did you choose that name?

4468
02:38:01,210 --> 02:38:04,110
That's my dad's name

4469
02:38:04,310 --> 02:38:06,110
You REALLY named the baby after your father?

4470
02:38:06,110 --> 02:38:09,810
I was already thinking to name him that

4471
02:38:09,110 --> 02:38:10,010
You were already thinking that?

4472
02:38:09,810 --> 02:38:11,410
Yeah, if I had a son next

4473
02:38:11,410 --> 02:38:14,210
Is Akio alright?

4474
02:38:13,110 --> 02:38:14,910
It might make Hosei's father bless him

4475
02:38:14,910 --> 02:38:15,610
Yes

4476
02:38:16,010 --> 02:38:20,050
The baby is named Akio now

4477
02:38:16,180 --> 02:38:18,580
It's not Tameguchi at all

4478
02:38:20,080 --> 02:38:30,080
Announcement

4479
02:38:21,580 --> 02:38:23,780
Tameguchi OK ends in

4480
02:38:23,780 --> 02:38:24,580
5 seconds

4481
02:38:24,780 --> 02:38:25,680
Is it okay?

4482
02:38:24,980 --> 02:38:25,680
4...

4483
02:38:25,680 --> 02:38:27,580
Hey, watch watch

4484
02:38:26,080 --> 02:38:26,580
3...

4485
02:38:26,980 --> 02:38:27,480
2...

4486
02:38:27,580 --> 02:38:28,480
Quickly, WATCH!!

4487
02:38:27,980 --> 02:38:28,680
1...

4488
02:38:28,880 --> 02:38:29,480
0.

4489
02:38:29,780 --> 02:38:31,080
ZERO

4490
02:38:31,080 --> 02:38:31,680
Please watch

4491
02:38:36,380 --> 02:38:37,980
I already saw it anyway

4492
02:38:37,180 --> 02:38:38,280
It's impossible

4493
02:38:38,980 --> 02:38:41,880
This really makes me mad

4494
02:38:42,480 --> 02:38:43,880
That really gets me

4495
02:38:46,280 --> 02:38:48,580
That gets me

4496
02:38:48,880 --> 02:38:49,480
Alright

4497
02:38:49,480 --> 02:38:50,880
He really does look like you

4498
02:38:50,680 --> 02:38:54,780
You've got a really big burden

4499
02:38:53,380 --> 02:38:55,880
Right, he really looks like him...

4500
02:38:55,380 --> 02:38:56,780
He looks like Hosei-san's child

4501
02:38:56,880 --> 02:38:59,480
Wait, he looks like he's happy

4502
02:38:57,080 --> 02:38:58,880
He looks like Hosei-san's child

4503
02:38:58,980 --> 02:38:59,680
Yes

4504
02:38:59,680 --> 02:39:01,180
Isn't this in the way?

4505
02:39:01,880 --> 02:39:03,280
It should be okay

4506
02:39:03,580 --> 02:39:05,080
Isn't this Tanaka's

4507
02:39:05,080 --> 02:39:07,080
last DVD?

4508
02:39:06,880 --> 02:39:07,680
DVD

4509
02:39:10,480 --> 02:39:13,880
It seems like you guys found a baby

4510
02:39:13,080 --> 02:39:13,680
Exactly!

4511
02:39:13,680 --> 02:39:14,080
Yes

4512
02:39:13,880 --> 02:39:16,880
I'll take him up!!

4513
02:39:15,880 --> 02:39:16,880
Yes

4514
02:39:19,380 --> 02:39:20,580
Please, just...

4515
02:39:20,580 --> 02:39:21,080
It's safer that way

4516
02:39:20,780 --> 02:39:23,580
Take him up well, alright

4517
02:39:22,980 --> 02:39:23,980
He seems really upset

4518
02:39:24,550 --> 02:39:27,750
Tell him to "name him and treat him lovingly"

4519
02:39:26,550 --> 02:39:28,050
I will take him up

4520
02:39:27,750 --> 02:39:30,450
His name is Akio-chan. We named him.

4521
02:39:32,950 --> 02:39:34,550
He's safer that way though

4522
02:39:34,550 --> 02:39:36,550
You're right, it is noisy here

4523
02:39:37,250 --> 02:39:37,950
We'll do it that way.

4524
02:39:38,510 --> 02:39:42,010
So much happens here

4525
02:39:40,810 --> 02:39:42,410
It's unbelievable, a baby

4526
02:39:42,610 --> 02:39:43,210
DVD

4527
02:39:44,510 --> 02:39:45,610
Shall we?

4528
02:39:45,610 --> 02:39:47,310
That's all that's left, right?

4529
02:39:47,910 --> 02:39:49,910
In the worst case, you can use that card, so...

4530
02:39:50,110 --> 02:39:50,610
Right!

4531
02:39:51,210 --> 02:39:52,510
So you'll be totally fine

4532
02:39:52,610 --> 02:39:55,810
The DVD isn't scary at all

4533
02:39:54,710 --> 02:39:56,010
The part that makes me hesitant

4534
02:39:56,010 --> 02:39:57,010
Yeah

4535
02:39:57,610 --> 02:40:01,010
Nothing is scary, but...

4536
02:40:00,810 --> 02:40:01,610
Mmm, sure

4537
02:40:03,910 --> 02:40:08,810
Now, we resume Gaki-Culture. We will talk about the Ice Bucket Challenge.

4538
02:40:09,110 --> 02:40:14,310
We got the scoop on the worldwide phenomenon.

4539
02:40:18,510 --> 02:40:21,310
Various famous people gathered together and

4540
02:40:21,310 --> 02:40:25,810
the Ice Bucket Challenge boomed worldwide.

4541
02:40:26,350 --> 02:40:29,050
The boom began with celebrities

4542
02:40:29,050 --> 02:40:31,850
and spread to ordinary people.

4543
02:40:32,750 --> 02:40:34,250
And now,

4544
02:40:34,250 --> 02:40:37,650
a new challenge is beginning to spread worldwide.

4545
02:40:38,250 --> 02:40:40,850
And that challenge is...

4546
02:40:40,850 --> 02:40:42,950
I've never seen a challenge that amazing!

4547
02:40:42,950 --> 02:40:43,950
Even in my country,

4548
02:40:43,950 --> 02:40:47,250
everybody is talking about it.

4549
02:40:47,750 --> 02:40:49,650
The Ice Thai Kick Challenge!

4550
02:40:51,650 --> 02:40:54,950
Yes, Ice Thai Kick Challenge!

4551
02:40:54,950 --> 02:40:58,950
This worldwide challenge began in Italy,

4552
02:41:00,750 --> 02:41:03,050
then spread to Germany,

4553
02:41:08,550 --> 02:41:10,550
then Spain,

4554
02:41:15,050 --> 02:41:16,750
right now, this Thai man

4555
02:41:16,750 --> 02:41:19,250
is travelling the world

4556
02:41:19,250 --> 02:41:23,250
and is kicking 4,674 ordinary peoples' butts.

4557
02:41:24,650 --> 02:41:27,450
And now, he has arrived in Japan

4558
02:41:27,450 --> 02:41:30,250
his target is...

4559
02:41:34,350 --> 02:41:36,650
Wait, wait! What are you doing?!

4560
02:41:39,350 --> 02:41:40,450
What are you doing!?

4561
02:41:41,450 --> 02:41:44,450
This challenge, like the Ice Bucket Challenge,

4562
02:41:44,450 --> 02:41:47,250
will connect the last victim to the next.

4563
02:41:47,250 --> 02:41:49,950
So, Yaku will now nominate...

4564
02:41:49,950 --> 02:41:51,450
Who next to kick?

4565
02:41:51,250 --> 02:41:52,550
What are you saying?

4566
02:41:52,550 --> 02:41:54,350
Who next to kick?

4567
02:41:54,350 --> 02:41:57,250
The comedian Tsukitei Hosei

4568
02:41:57,450 --> 02:41:58,650
YOU'RE KIDDING!!!

4569
02:41:58,650 --> 02:42:00,350
The comedian Tsukitei Hosei

4570
02:42:01,250 --> 02:42:02,450
YOU'RE KIDDING!!

4571
02:42:04,850 --> 02:42:08,250
Hosei, Ice Thai Kick Challenge

4572
02:42:09,050 --> 02:42:11,810
WAIT!!!

4573
02:42:11,810 --> 02:42:13,810
IT SHOULD BE TANAKA!!

4574
02:42:15,010 --> 02:42:16,510
Wow, this is...

4575
02:42:16,510 --> 02:42:18,210
You're kidding!!!

4576
02:42:18,010 --> 02:42:19,310
Here he is, here he is

4577
02:42:20,010 --> 02:42:21,610
Oh come on

4578
02:42:21,810 --> 02:42:23,310
Even if you say that...

4579
02:42:22,010 --> 02:42:23,580
Are you serious!?

4580
02:42:23,580 --> 02:42:24,950
Shouldn't it be Tanaka?

4581
02:42:23,680 --> 02:42:25,580
Hold on, Yama-chan

4582
02:42:25,880 --> 02:42:26,980
Don't move

4583
02:42:26,310 --> 02:42:27,450
Yama-chan, you need to keep still

4584
02:42:26,480 --> 02:42:26,980
Hosei-san

4585
02:42:27,450 --> 02:42:30,410
Yama-chan, you need to keep still

4586
02:42:28,550 --> 02:42:29,750
You have to stay still for this

4587
02:42:30,550 --> 02:42:31,150
Stay still

4588
02:42:30,550 --> 02:42:35,150
Note: He says this in a very thick Thai accent

4589
02:42:31,350 --> 02:42:31,750
Stay still!

4590
02:42:32,750 --> 02:42:33,550
Ice Thai Kick!

4591
02:42:33,650 --> 02:42:36,150
First is the ice

4592
02:42:34,550 --> 02:42:35,150
Here goes the ice

4593
02:42:36,150 --> 02:42:37,450
AHHHH!!

4594
02:42:40,950 --> 02:42:42,150
AHHHH!!

4595
02:42:48,250 --> 02:42:48,850
Next, who are you going to nominate?

4596
02:42:48,850 --> 02:42:50,550
Next, who are you going to nominate?

4597
02:42:51,450 --> 02:42:51,910
Next, who are you going to nominate?

4598
02:42:51,910 --> 02:42:54,010
Next, who are you going to nominate?

4599
02:42:54,710 --> 02:42:55,510
Who are you doing to nominate?

4600
02:42:55,510 --> 02:42:58,510
HAMADAAAA!!

4601
02:43:05,510 --> 02:43:07,010
I never thought he'd choose me

4602
02:43:08,210 --> 02:43:10,880
This has nothing to do with ice

4603
02:43:11,410 --> 02:43:13,110
Ahhh!!

4604
02:43:17,310 --> 02:43:19,010
Ahhh!!

4605
02:43:24,910 --> 02:43:25,080
I don't like this

4606
02:43:25,080 --> 02:43:25,380
I don't like this

4607
02:43:25,380 --> 02:43:26,350
I don't like this

4608
02:43:27,180 --> 02:43:28,280
I shouldn't have looked at him directly

4609
02:43:30,280 --> 02:43:31,680
I shouldn't have looked at him directly

4610
02:43:31,880 --> 02:43:32,880
This is hell, this is pure hell

4611
02:43:32,780 --> 02:43:33,780
Man, it's hot in here

4612
02:43:34,410 --> 02:43:34,650
This is hell

4613
02:43:34,650 --> 02:43:35,010
This is hell

4614
02:43:35,010 --> 02:43:35,310
This is hell

4615
02:43:35,310 --> 02:43:35,650
This is hell

4616
02:43:35,650 --> 02:43:37,650
This is hell

4617
02:43:37,450 --> 02:43:40,450
It lingers long after, you know

4618
02:43:40,250 --> 02:43:41,250
You are right

4619
02:43:45,050 --> 02:43:46,650
See, this is what happens

4620
02:43:46,350 --> 02:43:47,350
Yes, it turns out like this

4621
02:43:47,850 --> 02:43:49,350
It's a Thai Kick after all

4622
02:43:50,980 --> 02:43:52,180
Did you see that?

4623
02:43:52,180 --> 02:43:53,180
Hamada's face, after he got kicked

4624
02:43:53,180 --> 02:43:54,680
Hamada's face, after he got kicked

4625
02:43:55,180 --> 02:43:57,780
That was scary

4626
02:43:57,180 --> 02:43:57,780
Are you okay?

4627
02:43:58,350 --> 02:43:59,850
So much pain... It's been so long since the last time

4628
02:43:59,850 --> 02:44:01,350
So much pain... It's been so long since the last time

4629
02:44:01,750 --> 02:44:04,050
But really, this, it's what this is

4630
02:44:02,250 --> 02:44:04,650
It's this face, this expression

4631
02:44:03,010 --> 02:44:05,080
This was a prediction

4632
02:44:06,380 --> 02:44:07,250
It was a prediction!!

4633
02:44:07,250 --> 02:44:08,550
It was a prediction!!

4634
02:44:10,850 --> 02:44:13,480
Completely the same expression

4635
02:44:11,750 --> 02:44:12,550
That's just too much

4636
02:44:13,150 --> 02:44:14,750
That's the exact same expression

4637
02:44:14,250 --> 02:44:15,450
But but, you know

4638
02:44:15,410 --> 02:44:16,210
If Hosei didn't challenge Hamada, then this wouldn't have happened

4639
02:44:16,210 --> 02:44:17,680
If Hosei didn't challenge Hamada, then this wouldn't have happened

4640
02:44:16,810 --> 02:44:18,310
You can't do that

4641
02:44:17,680 --> 02:44:19,450
If Hosei didn't challenge Hamada, then this wouldn't have happened

4642
02:44:18,910 --> 02:44:19,710
That's right!

4643
02:44:19,950 --> 02:44:23,050
Because it wasn't pre-determined!!

4644
02:44:23,050 --> 02:44:26,350
Terrifying!!

4645
02:44:28,550 --> 02:44:29,950
Please, just give me a break...

4646
02:44:29,250 --> 02:44:30,650
I even thought, "Oh God!"

4647
02:44:30,650 --> 02:44:32,350
Why wasn't it Tanaka?

4648
02:44:32,350 --> 02:44:32,680
Wow, I was spared

4649
02:44:32,680 --> 02:44:34,410
Wow, I was spared

4650
02:44:34,410 --> 02:44:36,080
The one looking this way was Hamada

4651
02:44:36,080 --> 02:44:37,580
The one looking this way was Hamada

4652
02:44:37,880 --> 02:44:39,180
It's not like I was trying to look your way

4653
02:44:39,180 --> 02:44:40,150
The person who was looking my way was the person I nominated

4654
02:44:40,150 --> 02:44:41,450
The person who was looking my way was the person I nominated

4655
02:44:41,750 --> 02:44:42,350
No no no

4656
02:44:41,950 --> 02:44:43,250
This was the perfect time

4657
02:44:44,450 --> 02:44:45,050
to use this

4658
02:44:44,980 --> 02:44:49,810
Punishments Go Easy Card goes unused

4659
02:44:44,980 --> 02:44:49,810
m 6 0 l 1342.5 0 b 1342.5 0 1342.5 1.5 1342.5 12 l 1342.5 12 b 1342.5 35.875 1342.5 149.75 1342.5 164.75 l 4.5 164.75 b 0 164.75 0 73.375 0 12 b 0 1.5 0 0 6 0

4660
02:44:45,310 --> 02:44:46,510
This could've been Tanaka...

4661
02:44:45,910 --> 02:44:46,510
That's true

4662
02:44:46,410 --> 02:44:47,310
If it had been me

4663
02:44:47,610 --> 02:44:48,110
That's right

4664
02:44:48,110 --> 02:44:49,110
I could've used this

4665
02:44:48,710 --> 02:44:49,810
There's no harmony

4666
02:44:49,810 --> 02:44:52,610
There's no hope for harmony

4667
02:44:52,610 --> 02:44:53,550
World peace is still very far away

4668
02:44:53,550 --> 02:44:55,810
World peace is still very far away

4669
02:44:56,110 --> 02:44:59,510
He also says, "Hamada," not "Hamada-san" after the Tameguchi OK card had already expired

4670
02:44:57,050 --> 02:45:02,210
HAMADAAAA!!

4671
02:44:58,310 --> 02:44:59,010
He did say that

4672
02:44:59,410 --> 02:45:00,210
That was ridiculous

4673
02:45:00,610 --> 02:45:01,610
He was in the wrong, indeed

4674
02:45:11,310 --> 02:45:11,550
Unnecessary

4675
02:45:11,550 --> 02:45:12,050
Unnecessary

4676
02:45:12,850 --> 02:45:14,650
You knew what you were doing

4677
02:45:13,550 --> 02:45:14,650
This is not helping your cause

4678
02:45:14,650 --> 02:45:15,550
No one asked for that

4679
02:45:17,750 --> 02:45:18,650
No way

4680
02:45:18,150 --> 02:45:22,550
Feeling exhausted after getting smacked really sucks

4681
02:45:28,780 --> 02:45:30,180
You didn't see Hamada's face when he got kicked, did you?

4682
02:45:30,180 --> 02:45:31,050
You didn't see Hamada's face when he got kicked, did you?

4683
02:45:31,880 --> 02:45:32,880
Well, no...

4684
02:45:32,610 --> 02:45:34,880
It was repulsive!!

4685
02:45:34,380 --> 02:45:35,680
You can see it right there

4686
02:45:35,680 --> 02:45:36,880
It's reflected accurately right there

4687
02:45:36,110 --> 02:45:38,580
It was that expression right there, that expression

4688
02:45:39,180 --> 02:45:41,080
That face though... really was...

4689
02:45:45,780 --> 02:45:48,280
I should've been okay on that one

4690
02:45:47,880 --> 02:45:48,780
Okay okay

4691
02:45:49,980 --> 02:45:52,480
Endo, you were laughing out loud

4692
02:45:53,380 --> 02:45:54,480
The judge...

4693
02:45:59,280 --> 02:46:00,580
I don't really like it there

4694
02:46:00,580 --> 02:46:01,180
You think so?

4695
02:46:00,580 --> 02:46:01,780
Gives me a bad feeling

4696
02:46:01,780 --> 02:46:02,480
Geez...

4697
02:46:07,910 --> 02:46:09,510
Hosei, you're all wet, aren't you?

4698
02:46:09,810 --> 02:46:10,710
In the room next door

4699
02:46:10,810 --> 02:46:13,710
A change of clothes is prepared for you, let's go

4700
02:46:12,710 --> 02:46:14,010
How many times are you gonna get changed?

4701
02:46:13,610 --> 02:46:14,710
Seriously

4702
02:46:15,110 --> 02:46:17,110
Just say "Tanaka" next time, seriously

4703
02:46:17,710 --> 02:46:18,510
I could've made use of it

4704
02:46:18,410 --> 02:46:20,480
No kindness at all

4705
02:46:19,580 --> 02:46:20,680
That is certainly right

4706
02:46:20,480 --> 02:46:22,110
Ended up with no kindness at all

4707
02:46:22,280 --> 02:46:27,280
Hosei's course of action already disturbed all the others

4708
02:46:27,580 --> 02:46:34,280
It's only just the beginning

4709
02:46:35,210 --> 02:46:37,450
What is this!?

4710
02:46:38,910 --> 02:46:40,510
4:45PM

4711
02:46:41,010 --> 02:46:43,610
Passing the 8 hour mark of prison life

4712
02:46:46,410 --> 02:46:48,810
This is so scary

4713
02:46:49,510 --> 02:46:50,110
You know, he...

4714
02:46:50,180 --> 02:46:51,810
When Chono appears, he always tries to get Tanaka and me to switch with him, right?

4715
02:46:51,810 --> 02:46:53,150
When Chono appears, he always tries to get Tanaka and me to switch with him, right?

4716
02:46:53,150 --> 02:46:56,950
When Chono appears, he always tries to get Tanaka and me to switch with him, right?

4717
02:46:54,950 --> 02:46:55,750
Indeed

4718
02:46:55,750 --> 02:46:56,950
That kind of thing, you know

4719
02:46:56,950 --> 02:46:58,850
He has a dark side, don't you think?

4720
02:46:58,850 --> 02:47:00,580
It comes out in those situations

4721
02:47:01,150 --> 02:47:01,550
It's just that

4722
02:47:01,550 --> 02:47:02,810
I didn't have that expression when I got kicked

4723
02:47:02,810 --> 02:47:07,380
I didn't have that expression when I got kicked

4724
02:47:04,910 --> 02:47:06,610
This is the truth

4725
02:47:06,810 --> 02:47:07,410
You don't even know

4726
02:47:07,710 --> 02:47:09,910
That image right there was...

4727
02:47:15,580 --> 02:47:19,810
Changed to Masked Pervert

4728
02:47:15,580 --> 02:47:19,810
m 6 0 l 1342.5 0 b 1342.5 0 1342.5 1.5 1342.5 12 l 1342.5 12 b 1342.5 35.875 1342.5 149.75 1342.5 164.75 l 4.5 164.75 b 0 164.75 0 73.375 0 12 b 0 1.5 0 0 6 0

4729
02:47:16,010 --> 02:47:16,510
See?

4730
02:47:34,110 --> 02:47:35,810
Pu

4731
02:47:40,210 --> 02:47:41,010
What the hell

4732
02:47:42,110 --> 02:47:43,450
I really don't get it

4733
02:47:43,410 --> 02:47:44,310
What the hell is that?

4734
02:47:44,450 --> 02:47:45,880
Are we allowed to do anything?

4735
02:47:45,980 --> 02:47:46,580
Um, what?

4736
02:47:46,050 --> 02:47:48,680
What kind of prank is this?

4737
02:47:47,880 --> 02:47:48,480
What is that?

4738
02:47:48,380 --> 02:47:49,680
Why are you playing around?

4739
02:47:49,880 --> 02:47:52,080
The bandages on your shoulder...

4740
02:47:51,780 --> 02:47:52,880
The bandages on my shoulder...

4741
02:47:52,780 --> 02:47:53,780
Are we allowed to do anything?

4742
02:47:54,380 --> 02:47:57,410
What the hell is that?

4743
02:47:56,610 --> 02:47:57,410
I don't even really know

4744
02:47:57,410 --> 02:47:58,110
I... honestly don't even want to do this

4745
02:47:58,110 --> 02:48:00,250
I... honestly don't even want to do this

4746
02:47:59,910 --> 02:48:00,510
It's this

4747
02:48:01,510 --> 02:48:03,410
Exactly, just when I thought I was going to get changed

4748
02:48:03,480 --> 02:48:05,980
This was the only thing there

4749
02:48:05,980 --> 02:48:06,480
What are you doing..?

4750
02:48:09,380 --> 02:48:12,080
There's no way this was the only thing there, seriously

4751
02:48:12,980 --> 02:48:15,480
There wasn't anything else, I'm telling you

4752
02:48:15,480 --> 02:48:17,310
I also don't like doing this

4753
02:48:17,310 --> 02:48:19,550
I don't get the meaning of it

4754
02:48:20,610 --> 02:48:23,210
Kahhh!!

4755
02:48:23,910 --> 02:48:26,250
Got me good!!

4756
02:48:26,610 --> 02:48:27,750
Your underwear is stained yellow as well

4757
02:48:27,750 --> 02:48:29,550
Your underwear is stained yellow as well

4758
02:48:28,750 --> 02:48:29,550
It's stained yellow

4759
02:48:29,950 --> 02:48:31,750
So full of malice!!

4760
02:48:31,750 --> 02:48:34,280
You're equipped with malice!!

4761
02:48:32,850 --> 02:48:35,450
Really, I know this is full of malice, but

4762
02:48:35,150 --> 02:48:38,180
Who was it that made the yellow stain!?

4763
02:48:37,150 --> 02:48:37,950
The yellow stain was...

4764
02:48:39,150 --> 02:48:39,750
Was it that way from the start?

4765
02:48:39,380 --> 02:48:41,950
It was that way from the start

4766
02:48:42,050 --> 02:48:43,650
Equipped with malice

4767
02:48:44,350 --> 02:48:46,350
Would you please?

4768
02:48:52,350 --> 02:48:53,650
"Would you please?"

4769
02:48:53,750 --> 02:48:54,650
Would you really say that?

4770
02:48:55,250 --> 02:48:55,850
Please stop

4771
02:48:56,280 --> 02:48:58,180
What the hell do you mean, "Would you please?"

4772
02:48:58,180 --> 02:48:59,310
That's gotta suck

4773
02:48:59,310 --> 02:48:59,910
Please, not me

4774
02:48:59,910 --> 02:49:00,880
Not me!! Seriously!!

4775
02:49:00,880 --> 02:49:01,480
Not me!! Seriously!!

4776
02:49:03,080 --> 02:49:06,080
Ahhhh!!

4777
02:49:11,580 --> 02:49:14,880
No way, that would hurt so bad

4778
02:49:12,380 --> 02:49:13,680
That hurt so much

4779
02:49:25,680 --> 02:49:26,180
No no no

4780
02:49:30,580 --> 02:49:32,380
How do you even put this on?

4781
02:49:35,880 --> 02:49:37,310
Like I don't mind wearing it, but it'll be lame

4782
02:49:37,310 --> 02:49:38,110
Like I don't mind wearing it, but it'll be lame

4783
02:49:44,450 --> 02:49:45,710
That part by your nose is all yellow

4784
02:49:45,710 --> 02:49:48,310
That part by your nose is all yellow

4785
02:49:51,410 --> 02:49:52,180
This isn't even funny at all

4786
02:49:52,180 --> 02:49:54,880
This isn't even funny at all

4787
02:50:05,310 --> 02:50:07,850
Your senpai is saying so

4788
02:50:07,250 --> 02:50:07,950
But even if you say my senpai...

4789
02:50:08,050 --> 02:50:09,450
Your senpai is telling you

4790
02:50:09,280 --> 02:50:11,610
Yes, but...

4791
02:50:09,980 --> 02:50:13,410
No no no, really

4792
02:50:10,610 --> 02:50:11,810
You can't do that

4793
02:50:11,610 --> 02:50:13,410
Really though...

4794
02:50:12,210 --> 02:50:14,110
Endo, you cannot do that

4795
02:50:14,110 --> 02:50:16,610
Your senpai is reaching out to you

4796
02:50:22,710 --> 02:50:23,110
See?

4797
02:50:24,650 --> 02:50:27,010
Right?

4798
02:50:29,310 --> 02:50:29,810
Just for a bit

4799
02:50:30,310 --> 02:50:32,010
Oh no, I mean...

4800
02:50:32,310 --> 02:50:34,310
Our senpai is telling us

4801
02:50:32,810 --> 02:50:34,710
It's already went around so...

4802
02:50:35,850 --> 02:50:39,050
Amazing Model Prisoners

4803
02:50:35,850 --> 02:50:39,050
Our Prison's Own

4804
02:50:38,750 --> 02:50:39,550
It started on its own

4805
02:50:39,750 --> 02:50:42,150
At Gaasuu Kurobikari Central Prison

4806
02:50:42,250 --> 02:50:45,350
We have Amazing Artisans

4807
02:50:42,650 --> 02:50:44,550
We have amazing artisans

4808
02:50:45,150 --> 02:50:48,250
Duty aside, they stand out from other prisoners

4809
02:50:45,950 --> 02:50:49,950
Stand out from other prisoners

4810
02:50:45,950 --> 02:50:49,950
as model prisoners

4811
02:50:48,650 --> 02:50:50,050
in their duty

4812
02:50:51,680 --> 02:50:54,980
Right now, let us present to you the model prisoners

4813
02:50:56,880 --> 02:50:59,980
They say he previously was a glass sculptor

4814
02:50:59,880 --> 02:51:02,780
Mr. K (42 years old)

4815
02:50:59,880 --> 02:51:02,780
Previous Glass Sculptor

4816
02:51:00,550 --> 02:51:02,550
Regarding his work with glass

4817
02:51:02,850 --> 02:51:04,550
he makes use of his artistry

4818
02:51:03,050 --> 02:51:08,350
Making use of his artistry

4819
02:51:03,050 --> 02:51:08,350
to significantly increase production

4820
02:51:05,250 --> 02:51:07,650
and significantly increases production

4821
02:51:09,550 --> 02:51:11,550
Not only that, but with these skills

4822
02:51:11,550 --> 02:51:16,450
Like a robot

4823
02:51:11,550 --> 02:51:16,450
he produces with such delicacy

4824
02:51:11,950 --> 02:51:13,650
he's almost like the newest model robot

4825
02:51:14,650 --> 02:51:16,950
He makes glass items with very little inconsistency

4826
02:51:16,450 --> 02:51:20,650
A work of art

4827
02:51:17,250 --> 02:51:20,450
with such delicacy and speed

4828
02:51:22,350 --> 02:51:25,550
And here, we have this model prisoner

4829
02:51:25,350 --> 02:51:30,350
Mr. Y (67 years old)

4830
02:51:25,350 --> 02:51:30,350
Superstar Model Prisoner

4831
02:51:26,750 --> 02:51:31,350
This man prides himself by using his artistry to be popular as the superstar of the prison

4832
02:51:33,850 --> 02:51:37,150
Just by going on with his daily life, he aspires to release a masterpiece

4833
02:51:37,550 --> 02:51:42,350
An unconventional and unthinkable

4834
02:51:37,550 --> 02:51:42,350
craft is what he hones

4835
02:51:37,850 --> 02:51:41,050
An unconventional and unthinkable craft is what this model prisoner hones

4836
02:51:42,350 --> 02:51:47,850
He shows us the debut of his great masterpiece

4837
02:51:43,150 --> 02:51:47,850
At this moment, he shows us the debut of his great masterpiece

4838
02:51:49,550 --> 02:51:53,950
7:00AM - Breakfast

4839
02:51:55,050 --> 02:51:59,450
2:00PM - Recess

4840
02:52:00,750 --> 02:52:05,150
9:00PM - Sleep

4841
02:52:06,750 --> 02:52:10,550
The model prisoner, carrying out his penal servitude

4842
02:52:07,150 --> 02:52:09,450
He carries out his penal servitude in a normal fashion

4843
02:52:10,950 --> 02:52:17,150
When will his masterpiece be debuted?

4844
02:52:11,250 --> 02:52:14,350
Just when will his masterpiece be debuted?

4845
02:52:17,050 --> 02:52:17,650
That's when...

4846
02:52:21,850 --> 02:52:24,450
The model prisoner slowly stands up.

4847
02:52:24,950 --> 02:52:29,150
He is about to use the toilet.

4848
02:52:27,450 --> 02:52:29,050
The moment of creation
of his masterpiece

4849
02:52:29,050 --> 02:52:34,050
The moment of creation
of his masterpiece

4850
02:52:29,250 --> 02:52:34,050
In fact, it is said that this is the moment that his masterpieces are made.

4851
02:52:38,350 --> 02:52:42,450
After using the toilet, on his crotch

4852
02:52:42,450 --> 02:52:44,250
is a large stain.

4853
02:52:45,250 --> 02:52:53,350
Model Stain

4854
02:52:45,350 --> 02:52:52,850
Yes, this is what is called the Model Stain, and it is none other than this that is proof of the masterpiece.

4855
02:52:46,750 --> 02:52:53,350
Proof of the Masterpiece

4856
02:52:57,250 --> 02:53:03,750
In order to commercialize the briefs that have had the Model Stain firmly stained into it, we now collect.

4857
02:53:05,650 --> 02:53:10,750
Superstar Model Prisoner

4858
02:53:05,850 --> 02:53:10,750
Ebisu Yoshikazu

4859
02:53:06,850 --> 02:53:10,750
He is Ebisu Yoshikazu, the model prisoner.

4860
02:53:13,350 --> 02:53:16,650
Why did you make me wear it?

4861
02:53:16,650 --> 02:53:20,550
I didn’t even have anything to do with it.

4862
02:53:17,080 --> 02:53:26,050
Hentai Mask with Model Stain

4863
02:53:17,080 --> 02:53:26,050
The Masterpiece

4864
02:53:27,750 --> 02:53:29,780
You have that string going right up into your ass.

4865
02:53:44,350 --> 02:53:45,650
What the hell?

4866
02:53:44,450 --> 02:53:45,950
What was that?

4867
02:53:45,850 --> 02:53:47,680
Don’t turn back!!

4868
02:53:51,350 --> 02:53:52,850
Ow!!

4869
02:53:58,250 --> 02:53:58,450
No.

4870
02:53:58,450 --> 02:53:59,050
No.

4871
02:53:59,050 --> 02:54:00,050
This is bad.

4872
02:54:00,750 --> 02:54:02,850
The Ebisu stain was rough.

4873
02:54:02,850 --> 02:54:05,110
Let me change, come on.

4874
02:54:05,110 --> 02:54:09,250
This Ebisu product…

4875
02:54:06,450 --> 02:54:09,250
The Ebisu stain...

4876
02:54:08,750 --> 02:54:10,050
That was just...

4877
02:54:09,850 --> 02:54:11,650
This doesn’t make sense.

4878
02:54:11,150 --> 02:54:13,850
This doesn’t make sense, seriously.

4879
02:54:14,310 --> 02:54:16,150
That is seriously rough for your ass.

4880
02:54:16,150 --> 02:54:17,650
I'm bare here.

4881
02:54:17,150 --> 02:54:18,450
It’d be nice if you could

4882
02:54:18,450 --> 02:54:20,850
It’d be nice if you could

4883
02:54:19,050 --> 02:54:20,850
borrow Tanaka’s card.

4884
02:54:20,480 --> 02:54:25,280
Even with this, I can’t do this.  I can’t do this.  Seriously.

4885
02:54:20,880 --> 02:54:25,710
Punishments Go Easy Card

4886
02:54:20,880 --> 02:54:25,710
Punishments
Go Easy Card

4887
02:54:26,980 --> 02:54:27,880
The next time it comes, I’ll quickly put this hand towel in the way.

4888
02:54:27,880 --> 02:54:30,480
The next time it comes, I’ll quickly put this hand towel in the way.

4889
02:54:29,680 --> 02:54:30,180
What?

4890
02:54:30,480 --> 02:54:32,910
If your punishment comes around.

4891
02:54:32,910 --> 02:54:33,310
Wha-, what do you mean?

4892
02:54:33,310 --> 02:54:35,480
Wha-, what do you mean?

4893
02:54:34,110 --> 02:54:38,310
So right when it comes, I’ll quickly put this here.

4894
02:54:34,510 --> 02:54:37,310
The pain will probably be halved.

4895
02:54:38,310 --> 02:54:39,410
The next time it comes.

4896
02:54:39,410 --> 02:54:41,410
‘Cause I can’t even watch this any further.

4897
02:54:40,910 --> 02:54:42,910
Will it really make a difference?

4898
02:54:41,710 --> 02:54:42,910
It’ll definitely make a difference.

4899
02:54:42,910 --> 02:54:44,810
It’s made from two layers.

4900
02:54:44,310 --> 02:54:45,810
That’ll totally make a difference.

4901
02:54:46,210 --> 02:54:52,210
So when it goes “Yamazaki Out!” and the guy comes, I’ll quickly come to the side

4902
02:54:52,510 --> 02:54:54,910
and when the guy winds back, I’ll quickly go like this.

4903
02:54:54,910 --> 02:54:55,710
Like this. Bang.

4904
02:54:56,550 --> 02:54:58,050
This’ll definitely make a difference. It’s cold, too.

4905
02:54:58,050 --> 02:54:58,950
This’ll definitely make a difference. It’s cold, too.

4906
02:55:00,550 --> 02:55:01,850
This is a nice idea!!

4907
02:55:01,850 --> 02:55:04,450
Nice idea!!

4908
02:55:06,150 --> 02:55:08,750
I feel sorry for you, watching you.

4909
02:55:07,850 --> 02:55:09,250
Yes, that's rough.

4910
02:55:10,250 --> 02:55:12,950
If I could take your place,

4911
02:55:11,450 --> 02:55:12,950
I would.

4912
02:55:13,180 --> 02:55:15,650
But it’s not like I have the power to do that.

4913
02:55:15,880 --> 02:55:18,750
If you asked for it seriously,

4914
02:55:16,980 --> 02:55:18,750
I think it’d go through.

4915
02:55:19,050 --> 02:55:21,650
No, it definitely won’t.

4916
02:55:21,580 --> 02:55:25,280
First of all, if I asked for that, then Hamada isn't going to just sit there quietly.

4917
02:55:29,650 --> 02:55:34,550
If I step up and say “I’ll do it,”

4918
02:55:32,150 --> 02:55:34,550
well, Hamada’s also a guy with a strong sense of responsibility.

4919
02:55:35,250 --> 02:55:38,550
So Hamada will end up doing it,

4920
02:55:38,550 --> 02:55:41,750
and that,

4921
02:55:40,350 --> 02:55:41,750
I can’t allow.

4922
02:55:42,150 --> 02:55:45,610
Because I also have a strong sense of responsibility.

4923
02:55:43,950 --> 02:55:45,610
These senses of responsibility, together, are

4924
02:55:45,610 --> 02:55:49,310
causing your situation right here, instead.

4925
02:55:50,310 --> 02:55:51,310
So, in the end…

4926
02:55:51,310 --> 02:55:52,510
So, in the end…

4927
02:55:53,110 --> 02:55:57,710
We stay just like this.

4928
02:56:01,910 --> 02:56:02,610
Right?

4929
02:56:06,450 --> 02:56:09,080
What a quandry...

4930
02:56:09,080 --> 02:56:11,980
If only we could use Tanaka’s card.

4931
02:56:12,310 --> 02:56:15,180
Switch cards with me.

4932
02:56:15,580 --> 02:56:16,180
But…

4933
02:56:16,180 --> 02:56:18,280
No, no, come on.

4934
02:56:18,380 --> 02:56:20,780
I mean, during the guinea pig thing,

4935
02:56:20,780 --> 02:56:24,480
people kept saying, “You’re a bad person...."

4936
02:56:24,480 --> 02:56:28,450
You can speak tameguchi with this.

4937
02:56:27,050 --> 02:56:28,450
Can he really use that?...

4938
02:56:27,650 --> 02:56:30,250
But the person who originally got the card already used it.

4939
02:56:28,450 --> 02:56:42,650
Only the person holding this card
can have punishments go easy on them

4940
02:56:28,450 --> 02:56:42,650
Punishments
Go Easy Card

4941
02:56:28,450 --> 02:56:42,650
Rules:

4942
02:56:30,250 --> 02:56:31,950
It won’t have any effect anymore.

4943
02:56:31,850 --> 02:56:32,950
No, it doesn’t say that.

4944
02:56:33,650 --> 02:56:35,150
It doesn’t say anything.

4945
02:56:35,150 --> 02:56:36,650
Nothing like “Only the original receiver…”

4946
02:56:35,350 --> 02:56:37,150
But if you could use it multiple times, I mean…

4947
02:56:36,550 --> 02:56:38,050
That’s right.

4948
02:56:37,550 --> 02:56:40,850
If you use this card – “Only the person holding this card,” it says, so that won’t…

4949
02:56:40,850 --> 02:56:43,450
So if we switch and I hold the card, then isn’t that fine?

4950
02:56:43,450 --> 02:56:44,650
But your card can’t be used anymore.

4951
02:56:44,650 --> 02:56:46,210
But your card can’t be used anymore.

4952
02:56:46,210 --> 02:56:47,610
Right, it was already used once.

4953
02:56:47,610 --> 02:56:52,810
So, “As long as people switch, it’s OK”

4954
02:56:49,910 --> 02:56:52,810
– we’ll just make that the rule.

4955
02:56:51,410 --> 02:56:52,910
Who are you telling that to?

4956
02:56:53,210 --> 02:56:55,710
It’s difficult to make that judgment here.

4957
02:56:56,510 --> 02:56:57,710
Why don’t you use it and then try laughing?

4958
02:56:57,710 --> 02:56:59,210
Why don’t you use it and then try laughing?

4959
02:56:59,210 --> 02:57:03,810
And then you'll find out if they go easy.

4960
02:57:01,810 --> 02:57:03,510
Then, in that case,

4961
02:57:03,510 --> 02:57:06,110
if I can switch cards, then I’ll laugh.

4962
02:57:07,010 --> 02:57:08,610
Let me switch cards with you, and then I’ll laugh.

4963
02:57:08,610 --> 02:57:13,010
You’ll laugh, and then they’ll probably go easy…

4964
02:57:11,010 --> 02:57:13,010
They’ll go easy, plus…

4965
02:57:13,510 --> 02:57:15,510
Oh, the hand towel.

4966
02:57:14,510 --> 02:57:15,610
Then I’ll laugh.

4967
02:57:16,610 --> 02:57:19,410
OK, then here.

4968
02:57:17,010 --> 02:57:18,410
Let’s do that.

4969
02:57:19,610 --> 02:57:20,710
That’s fine.

4970
02:57:19,810 --> 02:57:23,010
That has been officially handed over.

4971
02:57:23,610 --> 02:57:26,010
Request it. Declare it.

4972
02:57:24,010 --> 02:57:25,810
Yes.

4973
02:57:26,210 --> 02:57:30,410
I will use the Punishments Go Easy Card.

4974
02:57:30,510 --> 02:57:38,110
Announcement

4975
02:57:32,610 --> 02:57:36,010
The Punishments Go Easy Card is now in effect

4976
02:57:36,310 --> 02:57:38,110
We will go easy on punishments

4977
02:57:38,410 --> 02:57:43,310
Punishments Go Easy
START

4978
02:57:40,710 --> 02:57:42,510
And this, please.

4979
02:57:41,910 --> 02:57:42,910
Do we need this?

4980
02:57:43,310 --> 02:57:45,010
Well, they’ll go easy, right?

4981
02:57:44,950 --> 02:57:46,350
But, that,

4982
02:57:46,350 --> 02:57:49,850
you came up with the idea so can’t we use it?

4983
02:57:50,150 --> 02:57:50,950
Well, I guess.

4984
02:57:51,050 --> 02:57:52,250
OK, here I go.

4985
02:57:51,150 --> 02:57:52,150
OK.

4986
02:57:57,950 --> 02:57:59,250
Here it comes.

4987
02:57:59,650 --> 02:58:00,850
That's an out.

4988
02:58:00,350 --> 02:58:01,650
It’ll definitely come.

4989
02:58:01,650 --> 02:58:02,050
Yes.

4990
02:58:01,910 --> 02:58:04,110
This is it.

4991
02:58:03,010 --> 02:58:04,310
This is it.

4992
02:58:12,910 --> 02:58:14,110
Ow...

4993
02:58:16,210 --> 02:58:17,710
What is this?

4994
02:58:20,810 --> 02:58:23,410
It’s totally wrong, what the hell is this?

4995
02:58:23,410 --> 02:58:25,010
Come on.

4996
02:58:25,350 --> 02:58:26,150
What the hell?  It’s a lie!  We were lied to!

4997
02:58:26,150 --> 02:58:28,450
What the hell?  It’s a lie!  We were lied to!

4998
02:58:27,450 --> 02:58:28,750
That was totally meaningless.

4999
02:58:28,850 --> 02:58:30,050
We’re being lied to.

5000
02:58:36,850 --> 02:58:37,550
Scary

5001
02:58:37,210 --> 02:58:39,480
It’s not in effect at all.

5002
02:58:39,780 --> 02:58:40,880
They didn’t go easy.

5003
02:58:40,910 --> 02:58:47,510
Goes into effect only for the owner of the card

5004
02:58:41,610 --> 02:58:43,510
That means it only works for Tanaka.

5005
02:58:43,510 --> 02:58:45,510
That’s it.  That must've been it, right?

5006
02:58:46,310 --> 02:58:47,110
So…

5007
02:58:48,210 --> 02:58:52,210
Well, yeah, since it was in Tanaka’s drawer.

5008
02:58:52,180 --> 02:58:54,110
What about my hand towel?
Did it work?

5009
02:58:54,110 --> 02:58:56,310
It made

5010
02:58:55,210 --> 02:58:56,310
no difference at all.

5011
02:58:57,110 --> 02:58:57,610
It just licked my butt a little, like this...

5012
02:58:57,610 --> 02:59:01,410
It just licked my butt a little, like this...

5013
02:59:06,310 --> 02:59:08,310
Come on.

5014
02:59:06,310 --> 02:59:08,510
Argh, I see.

5015
02:59:08,510 --> 02:59:10,210
It was a lie!

5016
02:59:10,210 --> 02:59:12,610
Seriously, that was a lie.

5017
02:59:17,610 --> 02:59:20,110
It’s a lie.

5018
02:59:19,350 --> 02:59:21,250
You can’t just lie.

5019
02:59:23,650 --> 02:59:28,050
8 Hours and 30 Minutes

5020
02:59:23,650 --> 02:59:28,050
Prison Life

5021
02:59:24,180 --> 02:59:27,980
The sun is starting to set.  It’s 5 PM.

5022
02:59:28,280 --> 02:59:29,380
This way.

5023
02:59:28,580 --> 02:59:29,980
An essential part of prison life

5024
02:59:28,580 --> 02:59:29,980
Engaging in labor at the work area

5025
02:59:28,980 --> 02:59:32,180
The five will take part in an essential part of prison life.

5026
02:59:29,980 --> 02:59:35,380
An essential part of prison life

5027
02:59:29,980 --> 02:59:35,380
Engaging in labor at the work area

5028
02:59:32,180 --> 02:59:33,980
Engaging in labor.

5029
02:59:33,980 --> 02:59:35,680
Sit at the end.

5030
02:59:37,980 --> 02:59:39,580
This is better.

5031
02:59:40,450 --> 02:59:41,980
We will now have everyone

5032
02:59:41,980 --> 02:59:45,080
do some work.  Put these flyers into envelopes.

5033
02:59:45,080 --> 02:59:50,180
Task:	    “Making Flyers”

5034
02:59:45,180 --> 02:59:46,480
Take your job seriously.

5035
02:59:46,680 --> 02:59:46,880
Yes.

5036
02:59:46,980 --> 02:59:47,580
Yes.

5037
02:59:47,780 --> 02:59:48,780
Thank you for your cooperation.

5038
02:59:48,980 --> 02:59:50,180
Roger.

5039
02:59:51,380 --> 02:59:53,180
Everyone,

5040
02:59:53,180 --> 02:59:55,880
fold these flyers into thirds,

5041
02:59:55,880 --> 02:59:58,480
and put them into the envelopes.

5042
03:00:03,280 --> 03:00:04,480
The opposite way?

5043
03:00:04,680 --> 03:00:05,580
I think like this is fine.

5044
03:00:05,580 --> 03:00:06,880
He said into thirds.

5045
03:00:09,110 --> 03:00:10,910
I’ve brought the three that are assigned to cleaning.

5046
03:00:10,910 --> 03:00:14,910
Gekidan Hitori

5047
03:00:10,910 --> 03:00:14,910
Prisoner

5048
03:00:11,810 --> 03:00:12,910
Roger.

5049
03:00:13,310 --> 03:00:15,510
Clean the work area.

5050
03:00:15,610 --> 03:00:16,610
Yes.

5051
03:00:24,210 --> 03:00:25,210
Excuse me.

5052
03:00:25,950 --> 03:00:27,550
I'm thirsty.

5053
03:00:27,550 --> 03:00:31,950
You’re in the middle of work; not until you’re done!

5054
03:00:31,250 --> 03:00:31,950
Yes.

5055
03:00:32,750 --> 03:00:35,750
He’s strict.

5056
03:00:45,910 --> 03:00:50,810
Rehydrating while no one is watching

5057
03:00:59,110 --> 03:01:00,510
That’s quite a lot.

5058
03:01:00,410 --> 03:01:01,510
He was drinking like crazy.

5059
03:01:04,780 --> 03:01:06,780
You’re kidding me.

5060
03:01:16,950 --> 03:01:17,550
Huh?  There’s no water.

5061
03:01:17,550 --> 03:01:18,710
Huh?  There’s no water.

5062
03:01:18,710 --> 03:01:22,480
Pouring water into the vase

5063
03:01:51,410 --> 03:01:53,110
He's drinking too much.

5064
03:01:59,710 --> 03:02:03,910
There's no need for more.  All right, already.

5065
03:02:02,510 --> 03:02:04,410
What the hell?

5066
03:02:05,710 --> 03:02:08,510
He’s a freak show!!

5067
03:02:13,080 --> 03:02:15,680
It’s a merlion.

5068
03:02:27,680 --> 03:02:31,280
That was really amazing.

5069
03:02:30,580 --> 03:02:32,380
So amazing.

5070
03:02:33,480 --> 03:02:35,580
Is he really drinking all that?

5071
03:02:39,950 --> 03:02:41,950
Oy!! What are you doing!?

5072
03:02:43,950 --> 03:02:46,750
Take this guy away!! Quickly!

5073
03:02:45,950 --> 03:02:47,850
Amazing.

5074
03:02:54,650 --> 03:02:56,750
Uuu Guuguuu...

5075
03:02:56,850 --> 03:02:58,450
Gururururururu

5076
03:02:58,550 --> 03:03:01,050
Nnnn naaaaa

5077
03:03:02,680 --> 03:03:04,480
He couldn't get it out at the end.

5078
03:03:04,480 --> 03:03:06,480
He couldn't get it out at the end at all.

5079
03:03:10,410 --> 03:03:12,750
He looked like he enjoyed it.

5080
03:03:18,550 --> 03:03:21,450
You two, your cleaning duties are done for now.

5081
03:03:21,450 --> 03:03:23,250
Let's head over to the next place.

5082
03:03:23,250 --> 03:03:26,050
For you guys, keep doing what you're doing.

5083
03:03:26,050 --> 03:03:33,350
Current duties will be continued

5084
03:03:26,550 --> 03:03:27,450
Okay.

5085
03:03:27,250 --> 03:03:28,250
Alright.

5086
03:03:28,650 --> 03:03:32,850
You didn't even do much.

5087
03:03:31,650 --> 03:03:33,150
I'm doing it.

5088
03:03:55,430 --> 03:04:00,830
Fugitive

5089
03:03:55,430 --> 03:04:00,830
Fugitive

5090
03:03:55,430 --> 03:04:00,830
Itao Itsuji

5091
03:03:55,430 --> 03:04:00,830
Itao Itsuji

5092
03:04:08,980 --> 03:04:13,980
Escaping while crawling along the ducts

5093
03:04:29,850 --> 03:04:31,950
Bangs

5094
03:04:40,610 --> 03:04:42,910
You will be found out

5095
03:04:42,010 --> 03:04:44,310
Seriously... he'll see you.

5096
03:04:44,410 --> 03:04:46,710
He'll definitely be found out.

5097
03:04:55,910 --> 03:04:57,910
Can he even go through that thing?

5098
03:05:03,810 --> 03:05:06,710
Secretly brought mayonnaise

5099
03:05:11,910 --> 03:05:13,910
Why the hell did he bring mayonnaise with him?

5100
03:05:14,910 --> 03:05:16,910
Maybe it's important to him.

5101
03:05:18,380 --> 03:05:21,080
Maybe it was an important item for him.

5102
03:05:21,080 --> 03:05:23,280
Maybe it's something he always uses I guess.

5103
03:05:22,480 --> 03:05:23,780
I guess so.

5104
03:05:23,280 --> 03:05:24,550
What is he gonna do? Keep crawling?

5105
03:05:24,550 --> 03:05:26,950
Maybe something will come out from that side.

5106
03:05:26,150 --> 03:05:27,650
That's impossible.

5107
03:05:26,950 --> 03:05:28,850
He should go back.

5108
03:05:28,510 --> 03:05:31,510
Going back would be even harder.

5109
03:05:29,210 --> 03:05:30,710
Takes a toll on you physically.

5110
03:05:31,910 --> 03:05:33,810
But even if he goes back...

5111
03:05:34,110 --> 03:05:35,410
Ah, so it's like that.

5112
03:05:37,680 --> 03:05:40,780
Then why didn't he do the same thing on that side?

5113
03:05:40,980 --> 03:05:43,180
Maybe it won't turn.

5114
03:05:44,680 --> 03:05:46,380
It's 6pm.

5115
03:05:44,880 --> 03:05:49,480
Been living in the prison for 9 hours 30 minutes

5116
03:05:46,380 --> 03:05:48,880
The five prisoners are getting tired.

5117
03:05:48,980 --> 03:05:50,280
But...

5118
03:05:50,280 --> 03:05:52,980
The thing that Matsumoto is concerned about is...

5119
03:05:53,280 --> 03:05:58,910
This card... I want to use it but I'm not sure when to use it.

5120
03:05:58,910 --> 03:06:00,810
This is huge, because it's 10 minutes.

5121
03:06:00,810 --> 03:06:04,110
It's bad if you just use it and you have to go someplace else.

5122
03:06:04,110 --> 03:06:07,710
It's bad if you use it and someone enters, right?

5123
03:06:08,810 --> 03:06:10,010
That's true...

5124
03:06:09,910 --> 03:06:12,710
Then, I'll just use it now. It'll be a waste otherwise.

5125
03:06:13,010 --> 03:06:20,010
Now that I finally am using it, I really want to have fun; I think Endo would be great for that.

5126
03:06:20,810 --> 03:06:23,810
Just do anything that will make me laugh for 10 minutes.

5127
03:06:22,610 --> 03:06:25,510
But asking me to do that...

5128
03:06:25,510 --> 03:06:30,110
Because for me, Endo is my weak spot.

5129
03:06:28,710 --> 03:06:31,510
But that is...

5130
03:06:30,110 --> 03:06:34,010
Just like your Pteranodon, that really tickled me.

5131
03:06:34,010 --> 03:06:36,410
I don't even remember doing that.

5132
03:06:36,010 --> 03:06:37,910
Matsumoto-san has been bringing that up a lot.

5133
03:06:38,210 --> 03:06:40,710
It was really out of this world.

5134
03:06:40,210 --> 03:06:42,610

03:06:55,210 --> 03:06:56,710
Yup.

5142
03:06:57,410 --> 03:06:58,910
Whatever I do now is okay.

5143
03:06:58,910 --> 03:07:01,310
I'm gonna totally laugh a lot now!!

5144
03:07:01,610 --> 03:07:03,310
Now, I guess...

5145
03:07:03,310 --> 03:07:06,510
A Triceratops now is quite...

5146
03:07:06,810 --> 03:07:08,510
Don't you think so?

5147
03:07:08,210 --> 03:07:10,710
I think so too.

5148
03:07:09,110 --> 03:07:10,510
Now wait a sec...

5149
03:07:11,610 --> 03:07:12,910
I think so too.

5150
03:07:11,980 --> 03:07:13,680
Triceratops?

5151
03:07:13,680 --> 03:07:16,880
How did I do it before? I really can't remember.

5152
03:07:16,880 --> 03:07:18,580
It was like this.

5153
03:07:18,180 --> 03:07:20,080
Yeah, you were like this?

5154
03:07:20,080 --> 03:07:20,980
Like this?

5155
03:07:20,480 --> 03:07:21,380
Yeah, that's right.

5156
03:07:20,780 --> 03:07:23,580
Then, I'll be Suga-san, okay?

5157
03:07:23,680 --> 03:07:24,680
Ehhh...

5158
03:07:23,780 --> 03:07:24,880
I'm Nakamura-san.

5159
03:07:24,880 --> 03:07:25,980
Yes, Nakamura-san.

5160
03:07:25,580 --> 03:07:28,180
Yup, Suga-san was like this.

5161
03:07:27,580 --> 03:07:28,880
That's right.

5162
03:07:28,080 --> 03:07:29,080
Like this...

5163
03:07:29,080 --> 03:07:30,980
You were Tyrannosaurus.

5164
03:07:30,480 --> 03:07:31,580
Yup.

5165
03:07:30,880 --> 03:07:32,680
And I was a...

5166
03:07:32,580 --> 03:07:33,480
Pte...

5167
03:07:32,580 --> 03:07:34,980
I think he was a Pteranodon?

5168
03:07:33,880 --> 03:07:35,280
It was a Pteranodon!

5169
03:07:34,980 --> 03:07:36,280
Stegosaurus!

5170
03:07:35,780 --> 03:07:37,080
I'm Stegosaurus.

5171
03:07:36,480 --> 03:07:38,680
Yeah, that was it.

5172
03:07:37,280 --> 03:07:38,680
I'm Stegosaurus, and he is Pteranodon.

5173
03:07:38,680 --> 03:07:40,580
Suga-san was on this side, right?

5174
03:07:38,980 --> 03:07:42,180
Reenact the position at that time

5175
03:07:39,780 --> 03:07:41,680
Then, I'll be on this side.

5176
03:07:42,180 --> 03:07:43,880
They're wasting a lot of time.

5177
03:07:43,880 --> 03:07:45,980
It's a waste. Since I only have 10 minutes.

5178
03:07:46,280 --> 03:07:48,980
Just start anytime. I really can't remember anyway.

5179

5196

It was more furious.

5197
03:08:13,250 --> 03:08:16,050
I wonder how I did it last time. Maybe because the place is different.

5198

Since he himself can't remember how to do it...

5199

That's important.

5232
03:09:38,580 --> 03:09:42,280
Just remember. We just have to do it again, right?

5233
03:09:44,780 --> 03:09:48,680
Why don't you go and practice once first?

5234
03:09:48,680 --> 03:09:50,680
Maybe you're being too mindful in front of everyone.

5235
03:09:50,650 --> 03:09:53,550
Just go outside and practice.

5236
03:09:53,550 --> 03:09:56,550
And when you are ready at your own pacing, just come back in.

5237
03:09:56,550 --> 03:09:58,050
Maybe that will be better.

5238
03:09:57,650 --> 03:10:00,150
- So when he enters...

5239
03:09:59,150 --> 03:10:03,850
Just start when he enters, I think that would be better.

5240
03:10:02,050 --> 03:10:04,950
Then we will be on standby over there. We'll wait for you.

5241
03:10:05,150 --> 03:10:07,050
Maybe that would be best.

5242
03:10:06,650 --> 03:10:08,650
Since we're running out of time.

5243
03:10:08,650 --> 03:10:10,550
Because I don't find it funny at all.

5244
03:10:10,550 --> 03:10:13,150
Just think about what would be best for you to do.

5245
03:10:13,150 --> 03:10:14,950
Tanaka, what are you again?

5246
03:10:14,250 --> 03:10:17,550
I'm a stegosaurus.

5247
03:10:15,150 --> 03:10:18,550
Stegosaurus is a bit slow-moving, right?

5248
03:10:18,550 --> 03:10:20,850
You have to think whether this is a life or death situation.

5249
03:10:20,850 --> 03:10:22,950
Because you're not giving out that kind of feeling at all.

5250
03:10:22,950 --> 03:10:26,450
Maybe if you do that, I would laugh.

5251
03:10:25,150 --> 03:10:27,250
Why does this feel like a theater?

5252
03:10:26,450 --> 03:10:31,150
Maybe I would think, "Wow, this guy is giving his all" and I would laugh.

5253
03:10:30,050 --> 03:10:31,750
It's like a farce.

5254
03:10:32,150 --> 03:10:33,850
Theatrical farce.

5255
03:10:33,750 --> 03:10:34,950

03:11:35,080 --> 03:11:37,580
I want 10 more minutes too...

5284
03:11:38,210 --> 03:11:42,810
Maybe it would be better if you ad-lib more.

5285
03:11:42,810 --> 03:11:45,510
Since you're just saying "OU OU" and not anything else.

5286
03:11:45,510 --> 03:11:50,310
Maybe if you had shouted something else I would have laugh.

5287
03:11:50,710 --> 03:11:54,110
You could use the "OU OU" to have our attention

5288
03:11:54,110 --> 03:11:56,710
and then just change it at the end.

5289
03:11:56,710 --> 03:11:59,210
I wonder why you didn't say anything besides "OU OU"

5290
03:11:59,210 --> 03:12:02,210
I keep wondering, "Say something else Endo!!"

5291
03:12:02,510 --> 03:12:05,910
Even though you used up all of the time allocated...

5292
03:12:05,910 --> 03:12:10,010
Do you want to try and change it? The "OU OU" part.

5293
03:12:08,410 --> 03:12:10,110
But you can't laugh anymore.

5294
03:12:11,310 --> 03:12:12,910
It was really messed up.

5295
03:12:11,810 --> 03:12:14,610
What is he even thinking?

5296
03:12:15,380 --> 03:12:17,980
Just say something besides "OU OU".

5297
03:12:18,480 --> 03:12:19,680
Please go ahead.

5298
03:12:20,080 --> 03:12:21,180
Here I go.

5299
03:12:23,380 --> 03:12:26,580
OU

5300
03:12:24,880 --> 03:12:26,580
OU

5301
03:12:25,080 --> 03:12:26,580
OU

5302
03:12:25,280 --> 03:12:26,580
OU

5303
03:12:25,980 --> 03:12:26,580
OU

5304
03:12:26,680 --> 03:12:27,880
OU

5305
03:12:27,880 --> 03:12:30,580
OU

5306
03:12:28,080 --> 03:12:30,580
OU

5307
03:12:28,480 --> 03:12:30,580
OU

5308
03:12:28,780 --> 03:12:30,580
OU

5309
03:12:28,950 --> 03:12:30,050
OU

5310
03:12:42,310 --> 03:12:44,180
He won't get away from "ou"

5311
03:12:42,910 --> 03:12:43,910
Yeah

5312
03:12:44,180 --> 03:12:46,980
Ultimately he hasn't stopped saying "ou"

5313
03:12:47,880 --> 03:12:48,880
Ultimately he hasn't strayed from saying "ou"

5314
03:12:48,880 --> 03:12:52,580
Ultimately he hasn't strayed from saying "ou"

5315
03:12:57,080 --> 03:12:58,080
Yeah, but...

5316
03:12:57,680 --> 03:13:00,480
This guy is laughing too

5317
03:13:00,980 --> 03:13:03,880
Your "tata-ta-ta" was great though

5318
03:13:06,280 --> 03:13:09,780
But you brought back the "ou" so

5319
03:13:08,380 --> 03:13:09,780
I give up, I give up

5320
03:13:09,780 --> 03:13:12,280
Your "tata ta-ta" moment

5321
03:13:12,280 --> 03:13:14,280
was looking good

5322
03:13:14,280 --> 03:13:15,880
but then you felt like you weren't generating laughter

5323
03:13:15,880 --> 03:13:17,610
and you went back to using "ou"

5324
03:13:16,380 --> 03:13:18,180
The "ou"... yeah

5325
03:13:17,610 --> 03:13:20,610
I got that feeling very clearly

5326
03:13:21,910 --> 03:13:22,910
Can you try a bit more?

5327
03:13:22,910 --> 03:13:24,710
Can you try a bit more?

5328
03:13:24,710 --> 03:13:27,210
The two of you, to Endo

5329
03:13:28,210 --> 03:13:31,410
Are we still going to try it?

5330
03:13:29,510 --> 03:13:31,810
How many times do I have to do it?

5331
03:13:31,310 --> 03:13:32,710
Do it again

5332
03:13:34,010 --> 03:13:35,010
Yeah

5333
03:13:36,110 --> 03:13:38,910
We might have to do it onstage sometime

5334
03:13:38,310 --> 03:13:38,910
Yeah, let's do it

5335
03:13:38,910 --> 03:13:40,910
Let's do it right

5336
03:13:38,910 --> 03:13:42,610
Let's just finish it

5337
03:13:40,910 --> 03:13:42,910
What the hell is this?

5338
03:13:46,610 --> 03:13:48,810
We should practice so we can do it onstage

5339
03:13:47,110 --> 03:13:49,010
Let's complete it

5340
03:13:48,810 --> 03:13:51,880
We should practice so we can do it onstage

5341
03:13:52,180 --> 03:13:53,880
To me, honestly, it's not like a

5342
03:13:53,880 --> 03:13:58,480
To me, honestly, it's not like a

5343
03:13:55,980 --> 03:13:58,480
I get it or I don't get it type of thing

5344
03:13:58,480 --> 03:14:01,780
Even I am thinking "what is it"

5345
03:14:02,110 --> 03:14:04,610
You said it!! In the beginning!!

5346
03:14:05,010 --> 03:14:07,510
YOU said it first!!

5347
03:14:11,210 --> 03:14:14,010
What do you mean "not seeing it"?

5348
03:14:14,010 --> 03:14:17,310
You suddenly just said it!!

5349
03:14:17,510 --> 03:14:20,310
Right

5350
03:14:21,410 --> 03:14:23,280
Do it

5351
03:14:23,810 --> 03:14:24,510
Yes, I will

5352
03:14:30,710 --> 03:14:32,510
No more, no more

5353
03:14:32,510 --> 03:14:35,810
Seriously what the hell

5354
03:14:36,710 --> 03:14:39,310
I'm seriously getting confused

5355
03:14:37,810 --> 03:14:39,410
Oh no

5356
03:14:42,010 --> 03:14:42,810
Ah I can't

5357
03:14:43,080 --> 03:14:46,180
I don't understand your
point of view

5358
03:14:44,980 --> 03:14:46,180
My point of view is...

5359
03:14:46,180 --> 03:14:49,480
I seriously don't understand, but

5360
03:14:49,780 --> 03:14:50,980
Thank you

5361
03:14:50,480 --> 03:14:51,680
Thank you

5362
03:14:51,680 --> 03:14:53,680
Thank you

5363
03:14:58,480 --> 03:15:02,780
They've experienced prison life for over 10 hours now

5364
03:15:03,580 --> 03:15:04,580
It's over here guys

5365
03:15:04,780 --> 03:15:06,080
This way

5366
03:15:05,380 --> 03:15:13,980
prisoner's reunion

5367
03:15:05,380 --> 03:15:13,980
Observation of

5368
03:15:06,280 --> 03:15:11,380
The five of them will observe the prisoners' reunions

5369
03:15:12,080 --> 03:15:13,280
Hosei on the very end

5370
03:15:13,280 --> 03:15:13,680
Yes

5371
03:15:17,880 --> 03:15:18,580
Everyone you will listen quietly!!

5372
03:15:18,580 --> 03:15:20,480
Everyone you will listen quietly!!

5373
03:15:20,980 --> 03:15:23,280
Listen quietly...

5374
03:15:22,880 --> 03:15:23,480
Yeah

5375
03:15:25,610 --> 03:15:29,480
Dojima Tamaki

5376
03:15:25,610 --> 03:15:29,480
female

5377
03:15:26,480 --> 03:15:29,580
Dojima Tamaki, you have a visitor

5378
03:15:37,150 --> 03:15:39,650
We have to be careful...

5379
03:15:43,880 --> 03:15:48,380
Nakajou Kiyoshi

5380
03:15:43,880 --> 03:15:48,380
Tamaki's man

5381
03:15:51,080 --> 03:15:52,580
How annoying

5382
03:15:51,080 --> 03:15:53,080
Really?

5383
03:15:55,310 --> 03:15:57,110
I'm starting to see the point of view!!

5384
03:15:57,110 --> 03:15:59,710
I'm starting to see the point of view!!

5385
03:15:59,710 --> 03:16:00,810
They will show this off!!

5386
03:16:00,810 --> 03:16:03,210
They will show this off!!

5387
03:16:01,510 --> 03:16:03,210
Yes they will

5388
03:16:03,510 --> 03:16:04,410
Tamaki...

5389
03:16:05,210 --> 03:16:06,310
You...

5390
03:16:07,210 --> 03:16:08,410
It's been a while

5391
03:16:09,610 --> 03:16:11,110
Did you lose weight?

5392
03:16:13,010 --> 03:16:15,410
You lost weight too, didn't you?

5393
03:16:15,380 --> 03:16:22,110
Yakuza and female prisoner's reunion

5394
03:16:16,410 --> 03:16:18,810
How is prison life?

5395
03:16:20,010 --> 03:16:21,810
I'm doing well

5396
03:16:24,210 --> 03:16:25,610
What's with that face?

5397
03:16:26,310 --> 03:16:28,410
Are the younger members okay?

5398
03:16:29,910 --> 03:16:31,210
They're doing trivial things

5399
03:16:31,810 --> 03:16:34,610
that don't make money

5400
03:16:36,110 --> 03:16:39,610
These days, young men are easygoing and don't work hard

5401
03:16:40,510 --> 03:16:43,910
The Yakuza are eating well and making love with good women

5402
03:16:45,010 --> 03:16:47,010
That's how we live

5403
03:16:47,110 --> 03:16:48,310
That's typical of you

5404
03:16:49,610 --> 03:16:54,210
I remember what you said whenever you used to get mad

5405
03:16:56,010 --> 03:16:59,210
Once you bear the responsibility...

5406
03:16:59,210 --> 03:17:06,010
you can't put down the mikoshi partway

5407
03:16:59,210 --> 03:17:06,810
Note: Mikoshi can be translated as a palanquin or a portable shrine carried in festivals

5408
03:17:19,110 --> 03:17:21,010
Lately,

5409
03:17:21,310 --> 03:17:23,110
when I drink sake at midnight,

5410
03:17:24,010 --> 03:17:26,110
I get fed up with Yakuza life.

5411
03:17:27,510 --> 03:17:31,010
When you get out of prison, we'll get out of Yakuza life

5412
03:17:31,610 --> 03:17:33,910
and go somewhere far away.

5413
03:17:34,110 --> 03:17:35,610
That's nonsense

5414
03:17:35,810 --> 03:17:38,410
Yes it is, but because of me-

5415
03:17:38,410 --> 03:17:40,610
Say no more

5416
03:17:40,710 --> 03:17:42,410
I won't take it

5417
03:17:45,810 --> 03:17:46,810
You

5418
03:17:47,810 --> 03:17:52,210
are the woman who made me a man

5419
03:17:52,510 --> 03:17:55,010
Without you, I was just a lowlife Yakuza

5420
03:17:55,010 --> 03:17:59,010
You're stupid

5421
03:18:06,710 --> 03:18:09,210
What's going on?

5422
03:18:07,410 --> 03:18:09,210
Yes yes yes

5423
03:18:12,210 --> 03:18:15,610
We are forced to watch this show!!

5424
03:18:12,410 --> 03:18:14,610
Yes, definitely, that's deep enough

5425
03:18:15,910 --> 03:18:20,410
You're so close to me, but behind the glass you feel so far

5426
03:18:21,810 --> 03:18:23,010
Your

5427
03:18:24,410 --> 03:18:27,310
I want to feel your silky skin

5428
03:18:27,310 --> 03:18:30,010
I want to be embraced by your warm chest

5429
03:18:30,010 --> 03:18:34,010
I want to taste your body

5430
03:18:36,210 --> 03:18:37,510
Here

5431
03:18:37,710 --> 03:18:38,910
With this hand,

5432
03:18:40,010 --> 03:18:42,110
I want to hold your body

5433
03:18:42,910 --> 03:18:44,210
Really..?

5434
03:18:44,210 --> 03:18:45,310
Seriously... I'm not lying

5435
03:18:45,310 --> 03:18:46,510
Seriously... I'm not lying

5436
03:18:46,510 --> 03:18:47,410
Seriously..?

5437
03:18:47,410 --> 03:18:48,910
It's not a lie!!

5438
03:18:48,910 --> 03:18:50,210
So you're serious right?

5439
03:18:50,210 --> 03:18:53,510
It's not a lie!!

5440
03:19:02,510 --> 03:19:12,510
Lie (Nakajo Kiyoshi/1974)

5441
03:19:02,510 --> 03:19:12,510
When I see your crushed up cigarette butt, I see your lie

5442
03:19:12,710 --> 03:19:21,310
You have some good women, you have

5443
03:19:22,410 --> 03:19:27,510
Ah~ It was just over half a year

5444
03:19:27,510 --> 03:19:32,010
Ah~ She looks good in an apron

5445
03:19:29,550 --> 03:19:31,950
(about mic)

5446
03:19:29,550 --> 03:19:31,950
Where was she keeping that?

5447
03:19:31,950 --> 03:19:39,050
You asked me not to paint my nails, and then I cried

5448
03:19:39,350 --> 03:19:49,050
You are the man who can tell sad lies

5449
03:19:50,180 --> 03:19:52,680
It's a singing show!!

5450
03:19:52,550 --> 03:19:55,650
The story follows the song

5451
03:19:52,950 --> 03:19:54,950
Yes, that's right

5452
03:19:55,050 --> 03:19:56,050
Yes

5453
03:19:56,580 --> 03:19:58,480
What?

5454
03:19:57,480 --> 03:19:58,480
It's a lie, right!?

5455
03:19:59,080 --> 03:20:09,080
You left a bad habit, phone calling in the middle of the night

5456
03:20:00,780 --> 03:20:04,280
Oh no, no more

5457
03:20:03,280 --> 03:20:07,080
That's enough

5458
03:20:09,080 --> 03:20:18,880
Going to bed without locking the door

5459
03:20:09,780 --> 03:20:12,380
We already understand

5460
03:20:12,380 --> 03:20:13,780
That's enough

5461
03:20:13,880 --> 03:20:19,080
We're good

5462
03:20:19,080 --> 03:20:23,780
You have no intention to get together

5463
03:20:23,780 --> 03:20:28,780
Ah~ What will you do with the wedding dress?

5464
03:20:24,780 --> 03:20:26,780
It's really long

5465
03:20:28,780 --> 03:20:35,980
You were kissing me and telling me you liked kimonos

5466
03:20:35,980 --> 03:20:48,680
You are a man who can tell cold lies

5467
03:20:50,150 --> 03:20:53,450
They are in love

5468
03:20:59,050 --> 03:21:02,150
(prison guards) waited for the song to end

5469
03:21:00,450 --> 03:21:02,250
Yes, that's right

5470
03:21:02,150 --> 03:21:06,550
Tamaki!!

5471
03:21:03,150 --> 03:21:06,550
You!!

5472
03:21:09,950 --> 03:21:12,550
That's completely fine

5473
03:21:26,150 --> 03:21:30,550
At 7:30 PM, a strange scene unfolds in the reunion room

5474
03:21:33,010 --> 03:21:36,680
Dojima Tamaki

5475
03:21:33,010 --> 03:21:36,680
female

5476
03:21:34,610 --> 03:21:35,910
Dojima Tamaki,

5477
03:21:36,110 --> 03:21:38,610
you have a visitor

5478
03:21:39,310 --> 03:21:42,310
She just had a visitor

5479
03:21:48,510 --> 03:21:52,010
Nishioka Tokuma

5480
03:21:48,510 --> 03:21:52,010
Tamaki's man

5481
03:21:54,110 --> 03:21:55,510
What a powerful existence

5482
03:21:55,510 --> 03:21:59,410
What a powerful presence

5483
03:21:56,810 --> 03:21:59,410
They've brought in amazing people

5484
03:21:59,410 --> 03:22:00,310
What a bleak place to have a reunion

5485
03:22:00,310 --> 03:22:02,410
What a bleak place to have a reunion

5486
03:22:04,510 --> 03:22:06,610
Amazing

5487
03:22:05,410 --> 03:22:06,010
Tamaki-san is amazing

5488
03:22:06,010 --> 03:22:08,510
Tamaki-san is amazing

5489
03:22:07,610 --> 03:22:09,810
Tamaki-san is amazing

5490
03:22:09,610 --> 03:22:11,710
It's the same person

5491
03:22:11,010 --> 03:22:11,710
Yes, I know

5492
03:22:11,710 --> 03:22:12,510
Tamaki

5493
03:22:12,710 --> 03:22:13,610
You

5494
03:22:16,410 --> 03:22:18,010
It's been a while

5495
03:22:19,010 --> 03:22:20,410
Did you lose weight?

5496
03:22:21,110 --> 03:22:22,210
Aren't you the one

5497
03:22:23,410 --> 03:22:26,110
who lost weight?

5498
03:22:26,810 --> 03:22:27,710
So,

5499
03:22:26,850 --> 03:22:32,650
Yakuza and female prisoner's reunion

5500
03:22:29,850 --> 03:22:31,850
I've been doing well, thanks to you

5501
03:22:32,850 --> 03:22:34,450
Are the younger members okay?

5502
03:22:36,250 --> 03:22:39,250
They're doing trivial things that don't make money

5503
03:22:40,550 --> 03:22:44,050
We (already) heard this

5504
03:22:41,550 --> 03:22:44,050
We heard this

5505
03:22:45,050 --> 03:22:46,750
The Yakuza are eating well

5506
03:22:47,550 --> 03:22:50,350
and making love with good women. That's what we live for.

5507
03:22:51,450 --> 03:22:55,150
These days, young men are easygoing and don't work hard

5508
03:22:56,450 --> 03:22:57,750
That's typical of you

5509
03:22:59,450 --> 03:23:03,150
I remember what you said whenever you used to get mad

5510
03:23:04,780 --> 03:23:07,880
Once you bear the responsibility...

5511
03:23:07,980 --> 03:23:13,380
Notes: Mikoshi can be translated as a palanquin or a portable shrine carried in festivals; you've read this before too.

5512
03:23:07,980 --> 03:23:13,380
You can't put down the mikoshi partway

5513
03:23:07,980 --> 03:23:13,380
You can't put down the mikoshi partway

5514
03:23:14,080 --> 03:23:15,880
They just did that!

5515
03:23:15,980 --> 03:23:16,780
They've already done this

5516
03:23:17,380 --> 03:23:18,180
This happened already

5517
03:23:18,180 --> 03:23:18,980
We already know

5518
03:23:18,680 --> 03:23:20,380
This is just a waste of time

5519
03:23:20,180 --> 03:23:20,780
They already did this

5520
03:23:20,580 --> 03:23:20,980
This woman knows what she's doing

5521
03:23:20,980 --> 03:23:22,780
This woman knows what she's doing

5522
03:23:26,180 --> 03:23:27,180
She definitely knows what she's doing

5523
03:23:30,880 --> 03:23:35,280
You're so close to me, but behind the glass you feel so far

5524
03:23:36,380 --> 03:23:36,980
Your...

5525
03:23:38,480 --> 03:23:40,880
I want to feel your silky skin

5526
03:23:42,180 --> 03:23:44,080
I want to be embraced by your warm chest

5527
03:23:45,280 --> 03:23:48,180
I want to hold you close to me

5528
03:23:49,280 --> 03:23:49,780
Really?

5529
03:23:50,580 --> 03:23:51,380
Yes, really

5530
03:23:52,280 --> 03:23:53,180
You truly think so?

5531
03:23:53,080 --> 03:23:53,580
Yes

5532
03:23:53,680 --> 03:23:54,480
You truly think so?

5533
03:23:54,280 --> 03:23:54,880
Yes, it's true

5534
03:23:56,780 --> 03:23:57,180
But...

5535
03:24:00,280 --> 03:24:00,980
I can't do it

5536
03:24:02,980 --> 03:24:03,680
I can't do it

5537
03:24:04,680 --> 03:24:04,980
What?

5538
03:24:05,280 --> 03:24:06,980
The man I am right now can't do it

5539
03:24:07,880 --> 03:24:08,480
Can't do it

5540
03:24:10,180 --> 03:24:10,780
Tamaki!

5541
03:24:14,380 --> 03:24:15,080
Forgive me

5542
03:24:16,080 --> 03:24:16,680
This is how it is

5543
03:24:18,910 --> 03:24:23,980
Exits after a different progression

5544
03:24:18,910 --> 03:24:23,980

5545
03:24:19,180 --> 03:24:19,980
Honey!

5546
03:24:24,250 --> 03:24:27,250
Even though we loved each other so much...

5547
03:24:27,250 --> 03:24:29,350
Why... Why did it turn out this way..?

5548
03:24:29,350 --> 03:24:30,950
Why... Why did it turn out this way..?

5549
03:24:32,050 --> 03:24:33,750
Why did it turn out this way!?

5550
03:24:38,150 --> 03:24:40,550
Why oh why did it turn out this way~

5551
03:24:38,410 --> 03:24:43,910
Tetsu & Tomo arrive as they overhear "Why did it turn out this way"

5552
03:24:38,410 --> 03:24:43,910

Why oh why did it turn out this way~

5554
03:24:46,380 --> 03:24:50,680
Nishioka Tokuma joins in

5556
03:24:49,880 --> 03:24:50,980
Is this for real?

5557
03:24:51,480 --> 03:24:54,380
Such energy!!

5558
03:24:56,580 --> 03:24:58,080
So much energy!

5559
03:25:06,080 --> 03:25:07,480
What the hell is he saying?

5560
03:25:09,680 --> 03:25:12,780
Why oh why did it turn out this way~

5561
03:25:11,150 --> 03:25:16,310
Completely copies Tetsu's movements

5563
03:25:19,210 --> 03:25:26,010
Taking a group photo at the gathering

5564
03:25:26,110 --> 03:25:32,210
Look at the photo after it's done, there's always a guy who looks like this

5565
03:25:32,210 --> 03:25:42,510
There's always a guy with eyes half-closed

5566
03:25:37,810 --> 03:25:40,550
You're really into this!!

5567
03:25:42,450 --> 03:25:43,950
Why oh why~

5568
03:25:45,450 --> 03:25:49,550
It won't stop

5569
03:25:49,850 --> 03:25:50,850
I've had enough!

5570
03:25:50,650 --> 03:25:53,250
He can't breathe!!

5571
03:25:55,450 --> 03:26:01,350
It must be Tokuma, it must be Tokuma, it must be Nishioka Tokuma

5572
03:26:01,350 --> 03:26:07,350
It must be Tokuma, it must be Tokuma, it must be Nishioka Tokuma

5573
03:26:02,950 --> 03:26:03,950
Are you okay?

5574
03:26:05,550 --> 03:26:08,650
Just a little more, just a little!!

5575
03:26:07,450 --> 03:26:08,450
Wow, this is a long one

5576
03:26:07,450 --> 03:26:13,050
It must be Tokuma, it must be Tokuma, it must be Nishioka Tokuma

5577
03:26:13,450 --> 03:26:15,250
Wow, you're really into this

5578
03:26:13,450 --> 03:26:19,150
It must be Tokuma, it must be Tokuma, it must be Nishioka Tokuma

5579
03:26:16,950 --> 03:26:19,150
Keep it up!!

5580
03:26:19,350 --> 03:26:26,850
It must be Tokuma, it must be Tokuma, it must be Nishioka Tokuma

5581
03:26:22,650 --> 03:26:23,850
You're so cool!

5582
03:26:24,150 --> 03:26:25,650
That's pretty amazing

5583
03:26:28,350 --> 03:26:41,650
It must be Tokuma, it must be Tokuma, Nishioka, Nishioka, it must be Nishioka Tokuma

5584
03:26:48,010 --> 03:26:50,510
Amazing

5585
03:26:48,850 --> 03:26:50,450
Bravo

5586
03:26:50,750 --> 03:26:53,150
Made it to the finish!!

5587
03:26:54,150 --> 03:26:55,450
That just now was...

5588
03:26:58,250 --> 03:26:59,650
So amazing, Tokuma-san

5589
03:27:03,050 --> 03:27:03,950
What is this?

5590
03:27:04,250 --> 03:27:05,050
That was amazing

5591
03:27:04,750 --> 03:27:06,050
Magnificent

5592
03:27:06,650 --> 03:27:07,650
That was magnificent, wasn't it?

5593
03:27:07,550 --> 03:27:08,350
It was magnificent

5594
03:27:09,850 --> 03:27:11,950
He can really move

5595
03:27:11,750 --> 03:27:12,650
There's still something left

5596
03:27:12,750 --> 03:27:13,850
What a bunch of fools

5597
03:27:16,450 --> 03:27:18,350
Why is it that I could never hate them?

5598
03:27:19,450 --> 03:27:22,850
It must be the weakness of a woman in love... That's right

5599
03:27:22,850 --> 03:27:23,850
It must be the weakness of a woman in love... That's right

5600
03:27:24,250 --> 03:27:26,350
No way...

5601
03:27:26,950 --> 03:27:32,750
It's a loss for a woman in love... That's right

5602
03:27:39,850 --> 03:27:40,950
What the hell is this?

5603
03:27:40,450 --> 03:27:41,450
Tamaki-san...

5604
03:27:44,950 --> 03:27:47,850
No more, no more

5605
03:27:46,450 --> 03:27:47,150
This is no good, huh?

5606
03:27:50,210 --> 03:27:51,310
8:00PM - Living as a prisoner: 11 hours and 30 minutes

Class is about to start

5619
03:28:30,750 --> 03:28:32,150
You can't do this

5620
03:28:32,750 --> 03:28:34,250
Oyakata...

5621
03:28:33,250 --> 03:28:34,050
Wow

5622
03:28:34,550 --> 03:28:36,950
This is messed up

5623
03:28:35,350 --> 03:28:37,850
The happy-go-lucky teacher appears

5624
03:28:37,350 --> 03:28:37,850
Yes...

5625
03:28:40,750 --> 03:28:41,350
This is just...

5626
03:28:40,950 --> 03:28:41,950
My ass hurts, ow ow ow

5627
03:28:41,550 --> 03:28:42,550
That hurts

5628
03:28:42,150 --> 03:28:42,950
Let's do our best here

5629
03:28:42,950 --> 03:28:43,750
Yes, really

5630
03:28:47,950 --> 03:28:51,050
Alright everyone, please take your seats. Class is about to start

5631
03:28:48,950 --> 03:28:53,550
Notes: Takamisakari Seiken was a sumo wrestler, but retired and became Furiwake-oyakata, with "oyakata" being a title for sumo coaches.

5632
03:28:48,950 --> 03:28:53,550
Sakamoto Furiwake

Like really?

5635
03:29:01,050 --> 03:29:02,550
Was that cutscene necessary?

5636
03:29:02,350 --> 03:29:04,050
Was that expression really necessary?

5637
03:29:05,250 --> 03:29:06,150
Not necessary

5638
03:29:06,850 --> 03:29:08,350
He just did that on his own, didn't he?

5639
03:29:08,450 --> 03:29:09,050
I don't get it

5640
03:29:08,750 --> 03:29:10,050
Overall, it was not needed

5641
03:29:09,850 --> 03:29:10,850
So true

5642
03:29:10,350 --> 03:29:11,350
If he could've just dropped that, it'd be fine

5643
03:29:14,150 --> 03:29:16,350
I wonder what facial expression the script asked for...

5644
03:29:22,850 --> 03:29:23,350
Alright then

5645
03:29:32,150 --> 03:29:33,150
That was awful

5646
03:29:33,350 --> 03:29:33,950
So hilarious

5647
03:29:33,650 --> 03:29:35,550
Furiwake-sensei! There's an emergency!

5648
03:29:35,650 --> 03:29:36,350
Did something happen?

5649
03:29:36,350 --> 03:29:38,550
Katou started a riot and then in the broadcasting room...

5650
03:29:38,550 --> 03:29:40,550
WHAT'D YOU SAY?!

5651
03:29:43,850 --> 03:29:45,150
He's got the volume, but...

5652
03:29:45,650 --> 03:29:47,150
Wow

5653
03:29:47,050 --> 03:29:48,050
What a loud voice

5654
03:29:47,550 --> 03:29:48,650
Amazing

5655
03:29:50,650 --> 03:29:52,450
Would you really be that surprised?

5656
03:29:51,050 --> 03:29:52,750
Although other than being loud, there's nothing else

5657
03:29:54,450 --> 03:29:56,050
Furiwake-sensei! There's an emergency!

5658
03:29:56,150 --> 03:29:56,750
Did something happen?

5659
03:29:56,850 --> 03:29:59,050
Katou started a riot and then in the broadcasting room...

5660
03:29:59,050 --> 03:29:59,950
WHAT'D YOU SAY?!

5661
03:30:04,850 --> 03:30:06,550
3rd Year Class B!

5662
03:30:07,150 --> 03:30:09,650
Furiwake-sensei!!

5663
03:30:09,250 --> 03:30:15,050
3rd Year Class B

5664
03:30:09,250 --> 03:30:15,050
Furiwake-sensei

5665
03:30:09,650 --> 03:30:15,050
Notes: This is a parody of a famous Japanese drama called Kinpachi-Sensei

5666
03:30:12,050 --> 03:30:12,550
What the hell

5667
03:30:19,450 --> 03:30:22,650
I can see from far away

5668
03:30:19,450 --> 03:30:22,650
Notes: This is the opening theme to Kinpachi-Sensei, called "Hitotoshite"

5669
03:30:20,150 --> 03:30:23,650
Why the hell are you singing this?!

5670
03:30:30,550 --> 03:30:31,850
Very nice

5671
03:30:31,250 --> 03:30:31,850
Good

5672
03:30:32,150 --> 03:30:33,550
That, just now, was great

5673
03:30:33,650 --> 03:30:34,850
Nice, very nice

5674
03:30:38,610 --> 03:30:41,710
I can see from far away

5675
03:30:41,610 --> 03:30:42,510
Isn't this terrible?

5676
03:30:43,310 --> 03:30:48,210
I grasped my hand around yours

5677
03:30:45,410 --> 03:30:46,210
This isn't any good

5678
03:30:53,610 --> 03:30:55,110
Isn't this awful?

5679
03:30:55,410 --> 03:30:56,510
No good

5680
03:30:55,410 --> 03:30:58,710
Sumo wrestlers are usually pretty good at singing

5681
03:30:57,110 --> 03:30:58,710
Yes, they do have that stereotype

5682
03:30:58,410 --> 03:30:59,010
Right

5683
03:31:01,910 --> 03:31:02,510
Very good

5684
03:31:03,710 --> 03:31:04,310
Very good

5685
03:31:05,210 --> 03:31:11,010
Though I have no words to give to you

5686
03:31:08,010 --> 03:31:09,310
Sounds so gentle

5687
03:31:11,510 --> 03:31:12,610
Does he not know this song?

5688
03:31:12,610 --> 03:31:14,410
There's no way he doesn't know this song

5689
03:31:13,810 --> 03:31:18,310
I repeat the same feeling of sadness

5690
03:31:18,910 --> 03:31:23,210
That's right, I'm just human

5691
03:31:20,910 --> 03:31:22,910
If you laugh here, there's no end to it

5692
03:31:23,010 --> 03:31:23,810
That's exactly right

5693
03:31:25,310 --> 03:31:33,610
I meet other people as a person, I'm confused by people as a person

5694
03:31:34,510 --> 03:31:43,210
I hurt other people as a person, I bid farewell to people as a person

5695
03:31:41,610 --> 03:31:43,110
You're not going to go get it?

5696
03:31:43,610 --> 03:31:45,710
You should've went at that point!!

5697
03:31:47,310 --> 03:31:48,910
Don't give up, go for it!

5698
03:31:48,710 --> 03:31:50,610
Don't give up and go for it!

5699
03:31:50,610 --> 03:31:51,710
Why, was it laziness?

5700
03:31:51,710 --> 03:31:53,410
No more, no more of this

5701
03:31:56,610 --> 03:31:58,210
No no, this is no good

5702
03:31:59,310 --> 03:32:01,310
He must've thought it was a pain at that point

5703
03:32:02,710 --> 03:32:11,410
I hurt other people as a person, I bid farewell to people as a person

5704
03:32:06,110 --> 03:32:06,810
He already gave up

5705
03:32:09,710 --> 03:32:10,610
He gave up

5706
03:32:12,910 --> 03:32:13,710
But even so

5707
03:32:15,510 --> 03:32:16,110
I can only

5708
03:32:16,610 --> 03:32:18,010
He's completely given up at that point

5709
03:32:18,310 --> 03:32:20,710
love people

5710
03:32:20,810 --> 03:32:23,810
Broadcasting Room

5711
03:32:32,310 --> 03:32:33,610
Is this where Kato is?

5712
03:32:33,610 --> 03:32:34,310
Kato! Open up! Kato!

5713
03:32:34,310 --> 03:32:35,210
Kato! Open up! Kato!

5714
03:32:35,210 --> 03:32:36,210
Kato! Open up! Kato!

5715
03:32:36,710 --> 03:32:38,610
To all students of the school:

5716
03:32:38,610 --> 03:32:40,210
Be quiet!

5717
03:32:40,410 --> 03:32:43,710
Kato Masaru (Himself)

5718
03:32:40,410 --> 03:32:43,710
Naoe Kiichi*

5719
03:32:40,410 --> 03:32:49,710
*Note: Naoe Kiichi, the actor here, is the original actor who played the character of Kato Masaru in the actual Kinpachi-sensei TV series.  The scene being portrayed here is from an episode that originally aired in 1981.

5720
03:32:41,110 --> 03:32:43,410
I am Kato Masaru from 3rd year, class B.

5721
03:32:47,810 --> 03:32:49,010
Wow.

5722
03:32:48,510 --> 03:32:49,910
That’s really him.

5723
03:32:49,610 --> 03:32:50,810
Yeah, that’s really him.

5724
03:32:50,680 --> 03:32:53,250
He looks like an old lady, doesn't he?

5725
03:32:55,610 --> 03:32:57,510
You really need to go that hard?

5726
03:32:57,910 --> 03:33:00,110
To all students of the school:

5727
03:33:00,010 --> 03:33:01,710
Be quiet!

5728
03:33:02,410 --> 03:33:04,610
I am Kato Masaru from 3rd year, class B.

5729
03:33:05,610 --> 03:33:06,910
We did not take over the broadcasting room.

5730
03:33:06,910 --> 03:33:08,910
We did not take over the broadcasting room.

5731
03:33:09,610 --> 03:33:11,310
We’ve only come to settle a matter with Mr. Shimizu.

5732
03:33:11,310 --> 03:33:13,010
We’ve only come to settle a matter with Mr. Shimizu.

5733
03:33:13,910 --> 03:33:15,610
So when we’ve settled the matter, we’ll leave. Good?

5734
03:33:15,610 --> 03:33:16,610
So when we’ve settled the matter, we’ll leave. Good?

5735
03:33:16,610 --> 03:33:17,610
It's not good! Kato!

5736
03:33:17,610 --> 03:33:18,610
It's not good! Kato!

5737
03:33:18,610 --> 03:33:20,610
You're damn right it’s not good!

5738
03:33:21,010 --> 03:33:22,710
Now, sir,

5739
03:33:22,710 --> 03:33:24,610
can you tell us why you tormented us so much?

5740
03:33:24,610 --> 03:33:26,410
can you tell us why you tormented us so much?

5741
03:33:26,410 --> 03:33:28,010
can you tell us why you tormented us so much?

5742
03:33:28,010 --> 03:33:29,510
I didn’t torment at all.  I was only instructing.

5743
03:33:29,510 --> 03:33:31,010
I didn’t torment at all. I was only instructing.

5744
03:33:32,110 --> 03:33:34,010
Give me a break.

5745
03:33:34,010 --> 03:33:37,010
How is throwing out a rotten orange instructing?

5746
03:33:37,310 --> 03:33:39,110
I liked school. I had friends as well.

5747
03:33:39,110 --> 03:33:40,210
I liked school. I had friends as well.

5748
03:33:40,210 --> 03:33:41,710
You see,

5749
03:33:41,710 --> 03:33:44,010
your friends were the problem.

5750
03:33:42,710 --> 03:33:44,010
What kind of face is that?

5751
03:33:44,210 --> 03:33:46,010
Get out of here with that.

5752
03:33:47,010 --> 03:33:49,510
We have a right to come to school.

5753
03:33:50,510 --> 03:33:53,010
Apologize to us for taking away that right.

5754
03:33:53,010 --> 03:33:55,010
Get on your knees and apologize!

5755
03:33:56,010 --> 03:33:57,410
Kato!

5756
03:33:59,710 --> 03:34:00,710
I was wrong.

5757
03:34:00,710 --> 03:34:02,110
I was wrong.

5758
03:34:02,110 --> 03:34:03,910
I regret causing this misunderstanding.

5759
03:34:03,910 --> 03:34:05,110
I regret causing this misunderstanding.

5760
03:34:08,010 --> 03:34:09,410
What the hell is this?

5761
03:34:12,010 --> 03:34:13,210
Good for you.

5762
03:34:14,510 --> 03:34:15,610
Good for you.

5763
03:34:15,610 --> 03:34:16,710
Good for you.

5764
03:34:21,110 --> 03:34:22,410
It’s the police!

5765
03:34:27,510 --> 03:34:29,410
The famous scene.

5766
03:34:28,310 --> 03:34:29,810
Stop!

5767
03:34:28,710 --> 03:34:31,710
Get your hands off my students!

5768
03:34:31,410 --> 03:34:37,110
The world is always changing,

5769
03:34:37,110 --> 03:34:43,210
so only the stubborn suffer sadness.

5770
03:34:43,210 --> 03:34:48,810
Take something that doesn't change and use it as a metaphor,

5771
03:34:48,810 --> 03:34:54,510
and every time that something crumbles, blame it on just that.

5772
03:34:54,510 --> 03:34:58,210
Waves of protest slogans...

5773
03:34:55,210 --> 03:34:56,510
Why the hell?

5774
03:35:01,210 --> 03:35:02,410
Why?

5775
03:35:02,310 --> 03:35:03,610
Come on.

5776
03:35:04,810 --> 03:35:06,910
There was nothing like that before.

5777
03:35:08,410 --> 03:35:09,610
Why is Obachan…

5778
03:35:09,610 --> 03:35:10,710
Was she always there?

5779
03:35:10,050 --> 03:35:11,650
It was so sudden.

5780
03:35:10,750 --> 03:35:13,350
She wasn’t in there at all.

5781
03:35:12,150 --> 03:35:13,350
She wasn't there, right?

5782
03:35:12,450 --> 03:35:13,350
No, no.

5783
03:35:13,750 --> 03:35:21,350
Waves of protest slogans pass by.

5784
03:35:20,750 --> 03:35:22,150
That’s a hideous sight.

5785
03:35:21,350 --> 03:35:28,950
Wish for an unchanging dream upon the flow.

5786
03:35:24,450 --> 03:35:25,650
Look at that.

5787
03:35:28,950 --> 03:35:36,350
Stop the time, to fight together with those

5788
03:35:36,350 --> 03:35:42,750
who want to see an unchanging dream.

5789
03:35:54,350 --> 03:35:56,350
What a two-shot.

5790
03:36:01,050 --> 03:36:02,850
We are taking you back because

5791
03:36:01,850 --> 03:36:02,850
Is this going to be ok?

5792
03:36:02,850 --> 03:36:04,450
these adults here thought about what would be best for your future.

5793
03:36:04,450 --> 03:36:06,950
these adults here thought about what would be best for your future.

5794
03:36:07,650 --> 03:36:08,450
Apologize to them, properly.

5795
03:36:08,450 --> 03:36:10,450
Apologize to them, properly.

5796
03:36:25,750 --> 03:36:27,950
That hurt for sure.

5797
03:36:35,350 --> 03:36:37,650
I thought no way, but…

5798
03:36:36,750 --> 03:36:38,150
Yeah, I know.

5799
03:36:37,950 --> 03:36:40,150
But to do the parody, yeah, it’s a slap and then a hug.

5800
03:36:39,250 --> 03:36:40,450
The scene, yeah.

5801
03:36:41,150 --> 03:36:44,150
Wow, Kato.

5802
03:36:45,550 --> 03:36:46,750
This is a KO scene.

5803
03:36:49,450 --> 03:36:51,350
Wow.

5804
03:36:50,850 --> 03:36:52,050
That sound.

5805
03:36:52,050 --> 03:36:53,750
Wow.

5806
03:36:53,580 --> 03:36:55,280
You’re my students! Don’t forget that!

5807
03:36:55,280 --> 03:36:56,580
You’re my students! Don’t forget that!

5808
03:36:56,580 --> 03:36:57,780
You’re my students! Don’t forget that!

5809
03:36:57,780 --> 03:36:58,780
Kato! Don’t forget that!

5810
03:36:58,780 --> 03:37:00,280
Kato! Don’t forget that!

5811
03:37:09,880 --> 03:37:12,880
We have a new star.

5812
03:37:14,380 --> 03:37:16,380
9:30 PM

5813
03:37:14,680 --> 03:37:19,380
13 Hours

It keeps on going.

5818

Now, someone who has some information may begin.

We can start with anyone.

03:37:58,680 --> 03:38:00,580
On Hamada,

5842
03:38:00,180 --> 03:38:40,280
A common occurrence on the golf course

Hamada Masatoshi Classified Information

5844
03:38:00,580 --> 03:38:02,080
He really likes golf.

5845
03:38:02,080 --> 03:38:05,080
And he often goes golfing with his juniors.

5846
03:38:05,080 --> 03:38:06,380
There’s this common occurrence

5847
03:38:06,380 --> 03:38:08,280
where Hamada mistakes a mushroom for the golf ball.

5848
03:38:08,280 --> 03:38:10,480
where Hamada mistakes a mushroom for the golf ball.

5849
03:38:10,480 --> 03:38:12,680
This happens frequently.

5850
03:38:13,080 --> 03:38:13,980
Frequently, it goes, “Let me look for the golf ball."

5851
03:38:13,980 --> 03:38:14,780
"There it is! No, it's a mushroom."

5852
03:38:14,780 --> 03:38:16,880
"There it is! No, it's a mushroom."

5853
03:38:16,880 --> 03:38:18,380
That occurs frequently.

5854
03:38:18,380 --> 03:38:19,480
So on one day, Hamada takes a shot and it goes in the rough.

5855
03:38:19,480 --> 03:38:20,680
So on one day, Hamada takes a shot and it goes in the rough.

5856
03:38:20,680 --> 03:38:22,680
So on one day, Hamada takes a shot and it goes in the rough.

5857
03:38:22,680 --> 03:38:24,880
So everyone’s looking for the ball,

5858
03:38:25,080 --> 03:38:26,280
and he goes, “I found it!"

5859
03:38:26,280 --> 03:38:28,280
“No, it’s a mushroom."

5860
03:38:28,280 --> 03:38:29,480
Again with the mushroom.

5861
03:38:29,480 --> 03:38:31,280
“Oh, no, I got it, I got it," he says.

5862
03:38:31,280 --> 03:38:32,580
So Hamada hits the ball from there.

5863
03:38:32,580 --> 03:38:34,280
And he gets it on the green nicely.

5864
03:38:34,280 --> 03:38:35,880
“Nice shot!” everyone says, and they go to take a look, and it's a mushroom.

5865
03:38:35,880 --> 03:38:40,280
“Nice shot!” everyone says, and they go to take a look, and it's a mushroom.

5866
03:38:42,780 --> 03:38:44,080
Is that real?

5867
03:38:44,080 --> 03:38:45,380
Seriously?

5868
03:38:46,080 --> 03:38:47,780
It's impressive he got it on the green.

5869
03:38:47,080 --> 03:38:48,180
He got it on the green.

5870
03:38:50,180 --> 03:38:52,180
That's the kind of thing that happens when you're nearing the end.

5871
03:38:53,180 --> 03:38:55,280
Come on.

5872
03:38:55,180 --> 03:38:56,880
I can tell what are mushrooms.

5873
03:38:56,680 --> 03:38:58,280
And he examined it.

5874
03:38:58,280 --> 03:38:59,080
This is something

Hamada Masatoshi Classified Information

5876
03:38:58,980 --> 03:39:12,480
In the parking lot...

5877
03:38:59,080 --> 03:39:02,080
I heard from a junior of Hamada’s.

5878
03:39:02,280 --> 03:39:05,380
“I parked the car in the parking lot, so can you bring it around?” Hamada told him.

5879
03:39:05,380 --> 03:39:07,480
“I parked the car in the parking lot, so can you bring it around?” Hamada told him.

5880
03:39:07,480 --> 03:39:10,280
“I parked it in spot number 3.”  So he went,

5881
03:39:10,280 --> 03:39:12,480
and found the parking spaces were organized by alphabet.

5882
03:39:19,180 --> 03:39:20,080
No way.

5883
03:39:19,880 --> 03:39:22,280
Was it a B?

5884
03:39:24,680 --> 03:39:26,580
The B became a 3.

5885
03:39:28,480 --> 03:39:30,080
It was probably an E.

5886
03:39:33,180 --> 03:39:35,080
On Tsukitei Hosei,

For 2014, they went to  Hokkaido for the summer.

5893
03:39:43,280 --> 03:39:45,680
Summers in Hokkaido It doesn’t have a rainy season and is dry,

5894
03:39:45,680 --> 03:39:48,180
so it’s a popular destination.

5895
03:39:48,180 --> 03:39:49,680
During Hosei’s on-location shoot, it was pouring rain the whole time.

5896
03:39:49,680 --> 03:39:51,280
During Hosei’s on-location shoot, it was pouring rain the whole time.

5897
03:39:57,880 --> 03:39:58,980
That’s true.

5898
03:40:01,680 --> 03:40:03,580
Unlucky for him, even though it’s an important show for him.

5899
03:40:04,080 --> 03:40:05,880
It’s dry during that time.

5900
03:40:05,650 --> 03:40:06,850

“But when we were young, this Halloween business,

03:40:16,750 --> 03:40:18,250
it was nothing like this."

5909
03:40:18,250 --> 03:40:19,950
This guy called Miysakao kept saying this to Matsumoto in the dressing room.

5910
03:40:19,950 --> 03:40:20,850
This guy called Miysakao kept saying this to Matsumoto in the dressing room.

No way!!"

5918
03:40:30,750 --> 03:40:33,550
So he won’t join in on the excitement.

5919
03:40:33,950 --> 03:40:36,050
“Back in the day, no way it'd be like this."

5920
03:40:36,050 --> 03:40:38,350
He’s disliking this more than anyone else.

5921
03:40:37,750 --> 03:40:38,750
Makes sense.

03:40:56,950 --> 03:40:57,750
An alien?

5931
03:40:57,750 --> 03:40:59,750
The silver kind.

5932
03:41:00,250 --> 03:41:00,950
The most cliché kind.

5933
03:41:00,650 --> 03:41:02,250
That's a gaffe, right?

Alien Mask

5935
03:41:03,350 --> 03:41:05,050
That's a gaffe, right?

5936
03:41:04,250 --> 03:41:05,650
The most unfunny kind.

5937
03:41:06,050 --> 03:41:07,650
But since he has a daughter, you know.

5938
03:41:07,150 --> 03:41:08,150
Oh, I see.

5939
03:41:09,250 --> 03:41:10,650
It’s not like him.

5940
03:41:10,650 --> 03:41:13,150
It's not a story like that but I have something on Matsumoto, if that's ok.

5941
03:41:13,750 --> 03:41:15,550

with Matsumoto.

5945
03:41:17,550 --> 03:41:19,750
It'd be me, Matsumoto Hitoshi,

5946
03:41:19,750 --> 03:41:21,350
and a junior who

5947
03:41:21,350 --> 03:41:22,750
Matsumoto hasn’t met, and we have these lunches set for 2 hours.

5948
03:41:22,750 --> 03:41:24,150
Matsumoto hasn’t met, and we have these lunches set for 2 hours.

5949
03:41:24,150 --> 03:41:25,750
It’s a really nice thing to have, regularly.

5950
03:41:25,950 --> 03:41:26,950
As if to show off to his juniors

5951
03:41:26,950 --> 03:41:29,050
As if to show off to his juniors

5952
03:41:29,050 --> 03:41:31,350
that he’s always funny...

5953
03:41:31,350 --> 03:41:34,150
So the junior and I are always there first,

5954
03:41:34,150 --> 03:41:36,550
and Matsumoto always arrives a little late.

5955
03:41:36,550 --> 03:41:37,450
With a pretty high frequency,

5956
03:41:37,450 --> 03:41:38,450
With a pretty high frequency,

5957
03:41:38,450 --> 03:41:39,650
he arrives and then,

5958
03:41:39,650 --> 03:41:42,450
“Jinnai, how’s the wife?”* he'll say,

5959
03:41:39,650 --> 03:41:44,450
*Note: Jinnai Tomonori had a high-profile marriage to actress Fujiwara Norika from 2007-2009.

5960
03:41:42,450 --> 03:41:44,050
and in a pretty loud voice.

5961
03:41:44,250 --> 03:41:47,150
When I say, “No, no, we divorced,”

5962
03:41:47,150 --> 03:41:48,950
he goes “Whaaat!!” and takes a peek at the junior,

5963
03:41:48,950 --> 03:41:50,050
he goes “Whaaat!!” and takes a peek at the junior,

5964
03:41:50,050 --> 03:41:51,650
but his bit falls flat every time.

5965
03:41:53,750 --> 03:41:57,050
Every time?

5966
03:41:55,750 --> 03:41:58,050
This guy... Pisses me off.

5967
03:42:00,550 --> 03:42:02,450
Matsumoto falls flat often with his juniors.

5968
03:42:03,450 --> 03:42:05,650
Is that really true?

5969
03:42:05,650 --> 03:42:07,650
And he arrives with full intention to do the bit even if it falls flat, just for the junior.

5970
03:42:07,950 --> 03:42:08,750
It makes things awkward.  Doesn’t break the ice.

It makes things awkward.  Doesn’t break the ice.

5972
03:42:09,950 --> 03:42:11,050
That’s right. It doesn’t break the ice.

5973
03:42:11,050 --> 03:42:13,550
He falls flat quite a lot.

He went to see a Japanese giant salamander.

5979
03:42:24,850 --> 03:42:27,350
Perhaps because he likes Japanese giant salamanders so much,

5980
03:42:27,450 --> 03:42:30,150
so he crouched down to the salamander's eye level

5981
03:42:30,150 --> 03:42:31,450
and he kept yelling,

5982
03:42:31,450 --> 03:42:33,150
"It's a giant salamander!!"

5983
03:42:41,450 --> 03:42:42,750
Is that it?

5984
03:42:42,250 --> 03:42:43,650
Is that really it?

5985
03:42:43,650 --> 03:42:44,950
No, no

5986
03:42:45,250 --> 03:42:46,450
Something else happened after that, right?

5987
03:42:46,450 --> 03:42:49,050
Like he got bitten by the salamander or something?

5988
03:42:48,450 --> 03:42:49,850
Um, no

5989
03:42:49,650 --> 03:42:52,250
Nothing else?

5990
03:42:55,750 --> 03:43:00,750
I have the same birthday as Tanaka: on April 26th

5991
03:43:00,750 --> 03:43:44,850
Tanaka Naoki secret information
TV show reunion

5992
03:43:01,350 --> 03:43:05,050
And we did this regular TV show together which ended 5 years ago, so we met up for the first time since then

5993
03:43:05,050 --> 03:43:09,350
And we did this regular TV show together which ended 5 years ago, so we met up for the first time since then

5994
03:43:09,650 --> 03:43:14,550
and we recorded a show on our birthday, April 26th,

5995
03:43:15,050 --> 03:43:18,550
and Tanaka said, "Do you want to go eat dinner?"

5996
03:43:18,850 --> 03:43:22,650
And at that time, Miyasako-san was with us,

5997
03:43:23,250 --> 03:43:28,350
and at 4 A.M., after Miyasako-san went home by taxi

5998
03:43:28,350 --> 03:43:30,450
he said,

5999
03:43:30,450 --> 03:43:33,850
"Why don't you take a walk around the Asahi TV station?"

6000
03:43:33,850 --> 03:43:35,950
Just take one more lap

6001
03:43:35,950 --> 03:43:38,050
and right before I got into the taxi,

6002
03:43:38,050 --> 03:43:39,650
he said, "Shina,

6003
03:43:39,650 --> 03:43:43,050
you looked very sparkly" to me

6004
03:43:43,350 --> 03:43:44,850
Is he a homo?

6005
03:43:50,650 --> 03:43:53,750
I'm not a homo! There were many reasons!

6006
03:43:56,450 --> 03:43:58,450
Doesn't he have a kid?

6007
03:43:58,450 --> 03:44:01,150
This is very fresh information!

Latest information

6009
03:44:01,450 --> 03:44:04,850
Right now, Tanaka seems to be doing a 24-hour job

6010
03:44:05,550 --> 03:44:06,850
but,

6011
03:44:06,850 --> 03:44:08,450
today his second son

6012
03:44:08,450 --> 03:44:11,250
receives his school entrance results.

6013
03:44:11,250 --> 03:44:13,150
He doesn't know the results,

6014
03:44:13,150 --> 03:44:13,750
but his son

6015
03:44:13,750 --> 03:44:16,850
got in.

6016
03:44:20,150 --> 03:44:21,750
What the hell!

6017
03:44:21,750 --> 03:44:23,050
What the hell!

6018
03:44:23,050 --> 03:44:24,450
That story!

6019
03:44:27,550 --> 03:44:29,350
His second son?

6020
03:44:28,750 --> 03:44:30,150
Ah, wow

6021
03:44:30,650 --> 03:44:32,350
Congratulations

6022
03:44:32,750 --> 03:44:35,150
Congratulations, congratulations

6023
03:44:34,550 --> 03:44:36,050

6024
03:44:36,050 --> 03:44:37,650
How embarrassing

6025
03:44:37,950 --> 03:44:39,350
Embarrassing

6026
03:44:39,150 --> 03:44:40,250
Over here!

6027
03:44:40,050 --> 03:44:41,150
Yes, yes

6028
03:44:41,150 --> 03:44:44,650
In the happy Tanaka household,

6029
03:44:45,450 --> 03:44:47,950
there is something called "service pants"

6030
03:44:47,550 --> 03:44:49,450
Service pants?

6031
03:44:49,150 --> 03:44:50,950
and it seems to be Naoki's

6032
03:44:50,950 --> 03:44:52,850
favorite thong

6033
03:44:52,850 --> 03:45:26,850
Tanaka Naoki secret information
service pants

6034
03:44:54,850 --> 03:44:59,450
and this is information from his wife

6035
03:44:55,250 --> 03:44:56,750
For what purpose?

6036
03:44:59,750 --> 03:45:03,050
It's from a brand called "hanky panky".

6037
03:45:03,050 --> 03:45:04,550
It's black and lace

6038
03:45:04,550 --> 03:45:07,850
He seems to like those type of thongs,

6039
03:45:07,850 --> 03:45:13,350
and the reason they are called service pants

6040
03:45:13,750 --> 03:45:17,650
is that even if his wife wears normal panties

6041
03:45:17,650 --> 03:45:22,650
and he wants to have sex with her,

6042
03:45:22,650 --> 03:45:26,850
he makes her change to the service pants.

6043
03:45:36,550 --> 03:45:38,350
This is information from his wife, so

6044
03:45:38,350 --> 03:45:39,750
there's no doubt about it

6045
03:45:39,750 --> 03:45:42,050
Is he a domestic pervert?

6046
03:45:48,150 --> 03:45:51,150
Isn't this information from his wife?

6047
03:45:54,850 --> 03:45:59,850
Usually, he is the quiet type, but when he is drunk,

6048
03:45:59,850 --> 03:46:14,350
Tanaka Naoki secret information
when he is drunk ...

6049
03:46:00,350 --> 03:46:04,850
he tends to his highly praise his wife's body.

6050
03:46:04,850 --> 03:46:07,350
He tries to seduce her by saying things like

6051
03:46:07,350 --> 03:46:08,950
"you are so cute; your face is very pretty"

6052
03:46:08,950 --> 03:46:09,850
in order

6053
03:46:09,850 --> 03:46:14,350
to have sex with her

6054
03:46:15,850 --> 03:46:17,750
Let's stop this

6055
03:46:27,250 --> 03:46:28,650
Let's stop

6056
03:46:29,150 --> 03:46:31,450
That is very unexpected

6057
03:46:31,150 --> 03:46:33,250
I like her, I like her

6058
03:46:35,050 --> 03:46:37,150
This is about Miyasako Hiroyuki

6059
03:46:36,850 --> 03:46:39,450
Are you okay?

6060
03:46:38,150 --> 03:46:42,850
So he was in this private room,

6061
03:46:39,450 --> 03:47:20,850
Miyasako Hiroyuki
at a meal ...

6062
03:46:43,050 --> 03:46:44,450
and he was eating

6063
03:46:44,450 --> 03:46:50,950
and it was Miyasako, Sada and me, and then he said to Sada,

6064
03:46:50,950 --> 03:46:52,150
"At Donki,

6065
03:46:52,150 --> 03:46:55,150
go buy me supplements."

6066
03:46:55,250 --> 03:46:59,250
So Sada said "Alright", and he went then came back

6067
03:46:59,250 --> 03:47:02,550
and he did an ad-lib,

6068
03:47:02,550 --> 03:47:06,550
and I've never seen something like it before

6069
03:47:06,550 --> 03:47:09,750
he bought an incredible %#@$

6070
03:47:09,950 --> 03:47:15,450
and I was taken aback! I thought "What the hell is he doing?" And Miyasako got very mad,

6071
03:47:15,450 --> 03:47:17,550
and he said, "Hey Sada,

6072
03:47:17,550 --> 03:47:20,850
this is one I already have!"

6073
03:47:28,150 --> 03:47:31,750
I'm seriously gonna kill you later.

6074
03:47:39,150 --> 03:47:42,050
I feel hurt by your unfunny story...

6075
03:47:43,350 --> 03:47:45,050
What could it be?

6076
03:47:44,150 --> 03:47:46,050
I have something...

6077
03:47:46,050 --> 03:47:49,850
My story is about someone named Miyasako

6078
03:47:50,050 --> 03:48:05,250
Miyasako Hiroyuki secret information
at a party ...

6079
03:47:50,350 --> 03:47:53,250
I don't really know the details,

6080
03:47:53,250 --> 03:47:56,750
but 8 years ago, he said

6081
03:47:56,750 --> 03:47:58,350
to my wife,

6082
03:47:58,350 --> 03:48:00,450
he said, "Unless you come with me in the taxi, I won't go home," and he was very fussy

6083
03:48:00,450 --> 03:48:05,250
he said, "Unless you come with me in the taxi, I won't go home," and he was very fussy

6084
03:48:09,250 --> 03:48:10,750
That's a lie!

6085
03:48:10,750 --> 03:48:12,950
8 years ago?

6086
03:48:16,150 --> 03:48:19,050
not even married 8 years ago

6087
03:48:18,950 --> 03:48:21,450
You were not married 8 years ago

6088
03:48:20,750 --> 03:48:21,550
Who?

6089
03:48:21,550 --> 03:48:24,150
You weren't married 8 years ago

6090
03:48:22,250 --> 03:48:24,150
I was.

6091
03:48:25,210 --> 03:48:27,010
It's been 26 years since I've met my wife: unbelievable

6092
03:48:27,010 --> 03:48:30,310
It's been 26 years since I've met my wife: unbelievable

6093
03:48:31,410 --> 03:48:33,210
Oy you're gonna end it here?

6094
03:48:35,810 --> 03:48:38,710
Alright, let's go

6095
03:48:38,910 --> 03:48:40,910
Stop here!

6096
03:48:40,710 --> 03:48:42,910
Oh, you're gonna go.

6097
03:48:43,910 --> 03:48:49,510
It's 10 P.M. Misbehaving prisoners are causing trouble

6098
03:48:52,410 --> 03:48:54,510
It's terrible!!

6099
03:48:54,510 --> 03:48:56,110
There are so many bad things

6100
03:48:56,610 --> 03:48:58,210
Gaasuu Kurobikari's two big gangs have started fighting

6101
03:48:58,210 --> 03:49:00,910
Gaasuu Kurobikari's two big gangs have started fighting

6102
03:49:00,910 --> 03:49:02,610
The guards can't subdue them,

6103
03:49:02,610 --> 03:49:05,310
so can you go and help?

6104
03:49:05,210 --> 03:49:07,110
Let's go

6105
03:49:05,610 --> 03:49:15,410
Two big gangs fighting
These 5 go help!!

03:49:05,610 --> 03:49:15,410
Two big gangs fighting
These 5 go help!!

6107
03:49:07,510 --> 03:49:09,310
There are two opposing groups everywhere

6108
03:49:07,810 --> 03:49:10,110
That's not rare

6109
03:49:09,410 --> 03:49:12,110
You can find them anywhere

6110
03:49:11,110 --> 03:49:13,110
They do exist

6111
03:49:12,410 --> 03:49:14,310
Yes, you're right

6112
03:49:13,310 --> 03:49:15,810
Can we really stop them?

6113
03:49:16,110 --> 03:49:21,710
Do they really have to fight at this hour?

6114
03:49:16,410 --> 03:49:24,510
Workplace

6115
03:49:29,010 --> 03:49:31,010
What the hell man!

6116
03:49:29,680 --> 03:49:34,510
Fight could break out at any minute

6117
03:49:31,410 --> 03:49:33,310
You did it!

6118
03:49:36,010 --> 03:49:37,710
It was you!

6119
03:49:42,480 --> 03:49:44,580
Hey everyone, can you be nice to each other?

6120
03:49:44,580 --> 03:49:45,880
WHA?

6121
03:49:45,880 --> 03:49:48,480
WHAT THE FUCK ARE YOU GUYS LOOKING AT!?

6122
03:49:49,180 --> 03:49:52,080
YOU GO TAKE A SEAT!

6123
03:49:52,380 --> 03:49:54,080
Yeah!

6124
03:49:53,480 --> 03:49:55,280
Go sit down!

6125
03:49:55,980 --> 03:49:59,580
Your enemies are over here, Ueshima!! Look over here, dumbass!

6126
03:49:59,580 --> 03:50:02,380
Who do you think you're talking to, you son of a bitch!?

6127
03:50:02,480 --> 03:50:05,180
This isn't a show; go take your seats!!

6128
03:50:05,180 --> 03:50:08,380
#%@#&*@!!

6129
03:50:08,380 --> 03:50:10,380
You good, Ueshima?

6130
03:50:10,380 --> 03:50:12,080
Let's see whose body is stronger! Let's start now!

6131
03:50:12,080 --> 03:50:14,380
Let's see whose body is stronger! Let's start now!

6132
03:50:14,380 --> 03:50:16,180
Let's do it then, dumbass!!

6133
03:50:16,180 --> 03:50:19,180
truce is unsuccessful

6134
03:50:20,480 --> 03:50:26,780
Conversation was not enough, so now they will use their bodies to show their strength

6135
03:50:21,480 --> 03:50:26,780
Two big gangs will fight mercilessly using their bodies

6136
03:50:21,480 --> 03:50:26,780
Two big gangs will fight mercilessly using their bodies

6137

Alright, here we go!!

6140
03:50:31,280 --> 03:50:33,780
The way to settle it is to fight!

6141
03:50:31,980 --> 03:50:36,580
Changing into fighting clothes

6142
03:50:33,280 --> 03:50:35,080
That's what we're doing!

6143
03:50:34,380 --> 03:50:35,680
Yeah!

6144
03:50:35,280 --> 03:50:37,380

03:50:38,580 --> 03:50:41,780
Alright! Anyway, bring that thing out!

6147
03:50:42,380 --> 03:50:43,780

Let's get it ready

6149
03:50:45,080 --> 03:50:48,580
Is it ready?!

6150
03:50:45,380 --> 03:50:47,080
Are you ready?

6151
03:50:46,680 --> 03:50:49,480
Yeah it is ready!

6152
03:50:49,480 --> 03:50:52,480
This is the "Chinko Machine"!!

6153
03:50:49,780 --> 03:50:51,980
What is this?

6154
03:50:51,980 --> 03:50:53,380
The legendary "Chinko Machine" has come out!!

6155
03:50:53,380 --> 03:50:55,580

6159
03:50:57,080 --> 03:51:00,680
Behind the part shaped like a cross

6160
03:51:00,880 --> 03:51:04,680
lies the punishment bar of the machine

6161
03:51:03,880 --> 03:51:08,080

This one is a little bit bigger

6282
03:55:27,780 --> 03:55:30,080

03:56:03,550 --> 03:56:05,050
I didn't say it!

6300
03:56:05,350 --> 03:56:07,050
That's nothing!!

6301
03:56:07,050 --> 03:56:08,650
No problem!

6302
03:56:10,450 --> 03:56:12,250
It's like I got bitten by a bee!!

6303
03:56:12,450 --> 03:56:13,550
That's painful though!!

Show them the exhibition!

6309
03:56:25,050 --> 03:56:26,450
He doesn't seem very excited

6310
03:56:26,450 --> 03:56:29,650
He just always seems kind of hesitant

6311
03:56:27,350 --> 03:56:29,150

6312
03:56:29,150 --> 03:56:30,350

Alright!!

6322
03:56:48,580 --> 03:56:49,780
Seriously?

6323
03:56:49,780 --> 03:56:51,780
What? Can he survive this?

6324
03:56:50,880 --> 03:56:52,280
It's 3!

6325
03:56:51,780 --> 03:56:53,580
Don't get scared!

6326
03:56:53,580 --> 03:56:54,280
It's lit!

Let's go!

6331
03:56:58,880 --> 03:56:59,580
Yes!

6332
03:57:11,080 --> 03:57:14,080
He's laughing!!

6333
03:57:22,550 --> 03:57:24,650
Only the rhythm was okay!!

6334
03:57:25,550 --> 03:57:26,950
So Iwao

6335
03:57:27,450 --> 03:57:30,750

03:57:35,150 --> 03:57:37,650
He doesn't seem very excited

6340
03:57:38,950 --> 03:57:40,250
He's sitting hardcore

6341
03:57:40,850 --> 03:57:43,550
This will challenge the strength of the surface of your ass

6342
03:57:43,550 --> 03:57:44,550
What do you mean?

6343
03:57:44,550 --> 03:57:47,250
On this fake grass,

6344
03:57:47,250 --> 03:57:51,350
he will be fine if he is dragged on it only on his butt

6345
03:57:51,350 --> 03:57:52,650
Show them!

I can do it in 30 seconds!

6348
03:57:58,950 --> 03:58:01,150
He said he can do it in 30 seconds!

6349
03:58:01,550 --> 03:58:02,650
Easily!

6350
03:58:03,150 --> 03:58:04,850
Show them, show them!

6351
03:58:04,550 --> 03:58:06,550
Really?

6352
03:58:05,650 --> 03:58:06,550
Ouch ouch ouch ouch

6353
03:58:07,050 --> 03:58:08,050
Don't hurt yourself

6354
03:58:08,050 --> 03:58:08,850
That will hurt

6355
03:58:09,750 --> 03:58:10,750
Start!

6356
03:58:15,950 --> 03:58:18,350
You can do it!

6357
03:58:18,350 --> 03:58:19,350
Ouch ouch

6358
03:58:23,050 --> 03:58:24,250
Ouch

6359
03:58:24,250 --> 03:58:25,350
He's saying "ouch"!

6360
03:58:25,550 --> 03:58:26,850
10 more seconds!

6361
03:58:27,350 --> 03:58:28,350

03:58:29,050 --> 03:58:29,850
Come on!

6364
03:58:30,750 --> 03:58:32,050
Can you do it?

6365
03:58:43,750 --> 03:58:45,650
But he didn't do it

6366
03:58:46,350 --> 03:58:48,150
He didn't make it, did he?

6367
03:58:51,950 --> 03:58:53,050
Just time!!

6368
03:58:53,650 --> 03:58:54,550
Okay

6369
03:58:54,550 --> 03:58:55,450
Okay okay!

6370
03:58:55,450 --> 03:58:55,850

03:59:05,350 --> 03:59:06,550
You can do it in 15 seconds right?

6379
03:59:06,550 --> 03:59:07,350
I will!

6380
03:59:07,550 --> 03:59:08,650
Ay!

6381
03:59:08,650 --> 03:59:09,350
Start!!

6382
03:59:09,850 --> 03:59:13,250
*screaming*

6383
03:59:14,050 --> 03:59:16,350
He's just screaming!!

6384
03:59:19,750 --> 03:59:21,750
Hey! Hey!

6385
03:59:29,950 --> 03:59:31,150
He couldn't do it

6386
03:59:32,150 --> 03:59:33,150
You couldn't make it!

6387
03:59:38,010 --> 03:59:40,510
Over here there is someone more amazing!!

6388
03:59:41,310 --> 03:59:45,310
We'll show you a real "hot-hot king"!!

6389
03:59:44,010 --> 03:59:45,610
What is the "hot-hot king"?

6390
03:59:45,610 --> 03:59:49,310
Our Haranishi is the real hot-hot king!

6391

03:59:46,310 --> 03:59:50,110
Haranishi Takayuki

6393
03:59:50,610 --> 03:59:53,410
With a pot full of very hot water,

6394
03:59:53,410 --> 03:59:56,510
he can catch anything!

6395
03:59:57,310 --> 04:00:01,410
Show them, show them!

6396
04:00:01,810 --> 04:00:03,710
What is going on?

6397
04:00:04,010 --> 04:00:05,710
We've prepared

6398
04:00:05,710 --> 04:00:08,710
5 pots that prevent hot water from cooling down

6399
04:00:08,710 --> 04:00:10,010
What's that?

6400
04:00:10,110 --> 04:00:17,210
Pots of boiling water, assortment of items

6401
04:00:10,110 --> 04:00:17,210
Prepared Items

6402
04:00:10,710 --> 04:00:15,110
Away from the 5 pots full of boiling water,

6403
04:00:15,110 --> 04:00:17,210
there is an assortment of items

6404
04:00:18,210 --> 04:00:24,210
Haranishi says he will catch any item with the pot of hot water

6405

Degawa Gang's Pride

6406
04:00:18,210 --> 04:00:24,310
No matter what is thrown, it must be caught with a pot of boiling water

6407
04:00:24,710 --> 04:00:25,910
Can you do it?

6408
04:00:25,910 --> 04:00:26,610
Ready?!

6409
04:00:26,610 --> 04:00:27,110
Yes!

6410
04:00:27,110 --> 04:00:28,210
Okay!

Okay! Change the pot!

Mochi! Since it's New Year's!!

6420
04:01:09,710 --> 04:01:10,910
Even then...

6421
04:01:13,110 --> 04:01:14,910
Such harsh training

6422
04:01:14,910 --> 04:01:16,010
Amazing!

6423
04:01:20,610 --> 04:01:21,910
How amazing!

6424
04:01:22,110 --> 04:01:23,610
Amazing!

6425
04:01:23,610 --> 04:01:25,510
Awesome!

6426
04:01:25,510 --> 04:01:27,310
Haranishi is gonna be in charge of the hot challenges

6427
04:01:28,210 --> 04:01:31,010
Now it's my turn! Bring that thing in!!

6428
04:01:33,710 --> 04:01:34,810
Oh what is this?

6429
04:01:34,810 --> 04:01:35,910
It's here it's here!

6430
04:01:36,410 --> 04:01:39,110
I will go down on the slide

6431
04:01:39,110 --> 04:01:42,510

6432
04:01:43,610 --> 04:01:49,610

04:01:43,610 --> 04:01:49,610
Slide down the slope with a sled

6434
04:01:43,610 --> 04:01:49,610
and deliver an item to his comrade on the opposite side

6435
04:01:44,010 --> 04:01:46,210
He will ride the slide on the sled

6436
04:01:46,210 --> 04:01:50,210
then he will deliver an item to his comrade

6437
04:01:50,210 --> 04:01:54,910
What will he deliver??

6438
04:01:54,910 --> 04:01:56,910
Since it's New Year's,

6439
04:01:54,910 --> 04:02:06,410
Hoshida

6440
04:01:54,910 --> 04:02:06,410
Item

6441
04:01:54,910 --> 04:02:06,410
Receiver

6442
04:01:54,910 --> 04:02:06,410
Sender

6443
04:01:57,610 --> 04:02:00,110
I will be delivering VERY HOT sweet sake

6444
04:02:00,110 --> 04:02:04,210
to my boss

6445
04:02:01,810 --> 04:02:06,410
Boss Degawa

6446
04:02:01,810 --> 04:02:06,410
Hot sweet sake

6447
04:02:04,610 --> 04:02:06,110
Please wait there!

6448
04:02:06,110 --> 04:02:07,410
Yes!

6449
04:02:07,110 --> 04:02:09,010
So he was the boss

6450
04:02:09,310 --> 04:02:12,010
So please just wait there with the stamp

6451
04:02:12,010 --> 04:02:13,810
Okay I will!

6452
04:02:14,910 --> 04:02:17,610
He said "VERY HOT sweet-sake"

6453
04:02:17,610 --> 04:02:19,110
Shall we begin?

6454
04:02:19,110 --> 04:02:22,710
Just hold the stamp

6455
04:02:22,710 --> 04:02:24,510
I will hold the stamp

6456
04:02:26,310 --> 04:02:27,810
I will start!

6457
04:02:30,610 --> 04:02:31,610
I will deliver it!!

6458
04:02:31,110 --> 04:02:32,210
Alright!!

6459
04:02:32,210 --> 04:02:34,210
The sweet-sake that contains my love!

6460
04:02:43,610 --> 04:02:45,150
Bump

6461
04:02:50,550 --> 04:02:51,880
Sorry

6462
04:02:51,550 --> 04:02:53,550
What happened?

6463
04:02:53,810 --> 04:02:56,750
What are you doing!?

6464
04:02:57,080 --> 04:02:58,710
This isn't good at all

6465
04:02:59,180 --> 04:03:04,080
Next challenger: Nakagawake Tsuyoshi

6466
04:02:59,180 --> 04:03:04,080
Ueshima army

6467
04:02:59,180 --> 04:03:04,310
Next, Ueshima army's Nakagawake Tsuyoshi faces the challenge

6468
04:03:04,380 --> 04:03:12,650
He will send hot wax to our boss

6469
04:03:04,510 --> 04:03:12,210
Hot wax

6470
04:03:04,510 --> 04:03:12,210
Package

6471
04:03:04,510 --> 04:03:12,210
Recipient

6472
04:03:04,510 --> 04:03:12,210
Sender

6473
04:03:04,510 --> 04:03:12,210
Tsuyoshi

6474
04:03:04,510 --> 04:03:12,210
Ueshima Boss

6475
04:03:12,310 --> 04:03:13,580
Boss, the wax will be coming soon! Okay, bring it on

6476
04:03:13,650 --> 04:03:15,980
Boss, the wax will be coming soon! Okay, bring it on

6477
04:03:16,750 --> 04:03:19,310
Tsuyoshi doesn't look like he likes it

6478
04:03:18,080 --> 04:03:19,980
Ready

6479
04:03:19,450 --> 04:03:24,010
He's putting on such a grim face

6480
04:03:21,980 --> 04:03:24,880
He's been looking like that the whole time

6481
04:03:24,150 --> 04:03:26,380
Is he really willing to do it?

6482
04:03:26,710 --> 04:03:29,080
Do it properly

6483
04:03:30,850 --> 04:03:33,580
Good luck!!

6484
04:03:37,980 --> 04:03:40,950
It burns!!

6485
04:03:43,980 --> 04:03:46,810
What is wrong with him?

6486
04:03:46,380 --> 04:03:48,580
It's hot

6487
04:03:48,880 --> 04:03:52,580
You didn't get much (wax) on your armpits

6488
04:03:53,380 --> 04:03:55,680
Even though there's no wax, why does your armpit feel hot?

6489
04:03:55,980 --> 04:03:59,910
I got hit by the board

6490
04:04:03,910 --> 04:04:05,650
He's only complaining

6491
04:04:07,950 --> 04:04:10,950
Bring it on, you bastards

6492
04:04:10,980 --> 04:04:13,950
That was a different level from Amazake

6493
04:04:14,080 --> 04:04:15,280
It's the same

6494
04:04:15,380 --> 04:04:17,510
Then in that case...

6495
04:04:17,610 --> 04:04:20,250
We'll end it with that!!

6496
04:04:21,180 --> 04:04:22,880
OY!! Bring it out here!!

6497
04:04:23,050 --> 04:04:24,480
It's here

6498
04:04:29,010 --> 04:04:31,810
Who's going to come forth!?

6499
04:04:32,080 --> 04:04:35,880
Ueshima Ryuuhei

6500
04:04:32,110 --> 04:04:35,880
Ueshima Army Boss

6501
04:04:36,850 --> 04:04:38,410
A representative from each team will face off at arm wrestling

6502
04:04:38,410 --> 04:04:40,110
A representative from each team will face off at arm wrestling

6503
04:04:40,180 --> 04:04:44,380
While arm wrestling, their butts will be filled with air

6504
04:04:44,480 --> 04:04:47,450
and they will wrestle as such

6505
04:04:47,450 --> 04:04:50,350
the rule is that whoever farts loses

6506
04:04:50,350 --> 04:04:52,450
That explanation is unnecessary

6507
04:04:56,150 --> 04:04:58,210
It's completely unnecessary

6508
04:04:57,780 --> 04:05:00,750
It's the same every year

6509
04:04:58,280 --> 04:04:59,180
It's the same every year

6510
04:04:59,250 --> 04:05:01,450
Every year

6511
04:05:04,150 --> 04:05:06,550
The way you say it is so bad

6512
04:05:05,680 --> 04:05:07,010
Good luck!

6513
04:05:07,080 --> 04:05:08,980
(This is for what happened 2 years ago)

6514
04:05:07,080 --> 04:05:14,380
Arm Wrestling with their butts filled with air

6515
04:05:07,080 --> 04:05:14,380
Whoever farts is the loser

6516
04:05:07,080 --> 04:05:14,480
Final Battle

6517
04:05:12,510 --> 04:05:14,750
You're on a roll today

6518
04:05:13,480 --> 04:05:14,710
I'm on a roll today

6519
04:05:14,650 --> 04:05:19,410
Degawa Army

6520
04:05:14,650 --> 04:05:19,410
No Farting Arm Wrestling Showdown

6521
04:05:14,650 --> 04:05:19,410
Ueshima Army

6522
04:05:14,850 --> 04:05:16,280
Go go!

6523
04:05:16,480 --> 04:05:19,110
You look fully ready today

6524
04:05:17,410 --> 04:05:19,450
Yeah, he does look ready

6525
04:05:20,610 --> 04:05:22,410
Fill it up fully

6526
04:05:22,510 --> 04:05:25,910
Ueshima never gets filled up (with air) does he?

6527
04:05:25,980 --> 04:05:28,080
Because you've got hemorrhoids!

6528
04:05:28,150 --> 04:05:30,110
SHUT UP!! DON'T SAY THAT!!

6529
04:05:30,180 --> 04:05:32,450
Don't mention my hemorrhoids!

6530
04:05:31,780 --> 04:05:34,010
Zits in your butt

6531
04:05:32,680 --> 04:05:34,810
I told you not to mention that, didn't I!?

6532
04:05:35,050 --> 04:05:37,180
It has nothing to do with this!

6533
04:05:39,780 --> 04:05:41,850
Shut up!

6534
04:05:42,410 --> 04:05:44,550
It's irrelevant

6535
04:05:44,550 --> 04:05:46,650
He got so pissed when that was mentioned

6536
04:05:48,310 --> 04:05:50,150
Excuse me

6537
04:05:49,280 --> 04:05:51,250
Excuse me

6538
04:05:50,680 --> 04:05:54,910
Air is pumped simultaneously for both of them

6539
04:05:55,350 --> 04:05:59,110
Boss, what's this thing?

6540
04:05:57,650 --> 04:05:59,150
Don't say it!!

6541
04:06:00,250 --> 04:06:01,450
Ueshima, why is your butt purple?

6542
04:06:01,450 --> 04:06:04,250
Ueshima, why is your butt purple?

6543
04:06:05,510 --> 04:06:07,950
Enough

6544
04:06:08,080 --> 04:06:12,080
Tanaka is filled, hurry up Ueshima!

6545
04:06:09,750 --> 04:06:11,350
Give me a minute; the tube came loose!

6546
04:06:12,150 --> 04:06:19,110
The tube is inside Tanaka

6547
04:06:12,550 --> 04:06:14,450
Is it inside?

6548
04:06:20,910 --> 04:06:23,950
The tube, the tube

6549
04:06:23,980 --> 04:06:28,050
The air is escaping through the tube!!

6550
04:06:25,780 --> 04:06:27,680
*Fart*

6551
04:06:26,980 --> 04:06:29,280
Air is coming out from the tube.

6552
04:06:29,380 --> 04:06:30,610
All right, let's go.

6553
04:06:30,910 --> 04:06:34,880
The tube was removed without problem

6554
04:06:31,010 --> 04:06:31,980
Pull it out

6555
04:06:33,650 --> 04:06:35,710
Gotta pull it out

6556
04:06:33,910 --> 04:06:36,380
That's true

6557
04:06:36,380 --> 04:06:39,680
Let's go, quickly!

6558
04:06:38,580 --> 04:06:43,080
Both butts have been filled up

6559
04:06:43,280 --> 04:06:45,610
His butt is rumbling

6560
04:06:46,950 --> 04:06:48,980
Ready

6561
04:06:47,780 --> 04:06:48,980
Go

6562
04:06:49,250 --> 04:06:50,980
Ah, it's coming out

6563
04:06:51,050 --> 04:06:52,810
Shit!

6564
04:06:52,780 --> 04:06:55,050
Fart*

6565
04:06:57,810 --> 04:07:01,680
*Fart*~~

6566
04:07:03,150 --> 04:07:05,850
What the hell is wrong with you guys?

6567
04:07:06,410 --> 04:07:08,450
Buu~ sound came out!

6568
04:07:09,280 --> 04:07:14,880
Ueshima escaped to backstage

6569
04:07:13,310 --> 04:07:15,450
There was a buu sound

6570
04:07:15,380 --> 04:07:18,010
Please wait for the boss to return

6571
04:07:18,010 --> 04:07:19,180
Boss

6572
04:07:18,780 --> 04:07:20,750
Boss ran away

6573
04:07:19,310 --> 04:07:20,810
Get back out here

6574
04:07:26,710 --> 04:07:28,310
Boss

6575
04:07:27,280 --> 04:07:30,150
You can't go empty your system like that while we're live

6576
04:07:31,280 --> 04:07:33,110
Just do it properly!!

6577
04:07:33,350 --> 04:07:35,510
Let's go let's go!!

6578
04:07:36,210 --> 04:07:37,250
Wait wait are we actually doing it again?

6579
04:07:37,250 --> 04:07:41,780
Wait wait are we actually doing it again?

6580
04:07:38,880 --> 04:07:40,850
Of course, let's do it

6581
04:07:41,910 --> 04:07:46,610
Restarting, air is pumped in again

6582
04:07:44,350 --> 04:07:46,150
This is a battle

6583
04:07:46,510 --> 04:07:47,910
Ah, wait

6584
04:07:47,950 --> 04:07:48,710
Ah, no more

6585
04:07:48,810 --> 04:07:50,280
Too much!!

6586
04:07:50,850 --> 04:07:52,510
*Fart*

6587
04:07:56,610 --> 04:07:59,550
Sorry, it's almost done

6588
04:07:58,710 --> 04:08:00,450
Wait

6589
04:08:02,510 --> 04:08:06,050
Both butts have been filled up

6590
04:08:04,610 --> 04:08:05,910
Battle, battle!

6591
04:08:15,210 --> 04:08:16,450
What the hell is happening!?

6592
04:08:19,310 --> 04:08:21,250
Ready, go!

6593
04:08:21,310 --> 04:08:22,610
*Fart*

6594
04:08:24,210 --> 04:08:25,050
*Fart*

6595
04:08:26,880 --> 04:08:30,150
We won!!

6596
04:08:38,050 --> 04:08:41,580
Somehow in the final showdown our team lost

6597
04:08:41,580 --> 04:08:43,610
You guys aren't too bad

6598
04:08:43,080 --> 04:08:48,680
Ends with reconciliation

6599
04:08:44,280 --> 04:08:46,480
Sorry for saying all those things

6600
04:08:45,680 --> 04:08:47,350
You're all pretty good

6601
04:08:54,710 --> 04:08:56,580
Time to go

6602
04:08:56,380 --> 04:08:59,880
It stinks

6603
04:08:56,850 --> 04:09:00,010
They ended up friends again in the end this year as well

6604
04:09:01,750 --> 04:09:07,180
Expression of relief on their faces

6605
04:09:01,750 --> 04:09:07,180
The life-threatening battle ends

6606
04:09:01,750 --> 04:09:07,180
When the life-threatening battle ends, the guys put on a look of relief

6607
04:09:08,710 --> 04:09:12,050
On one hand, for the 5 of them it isn't over

6608
04:09:11,910 --> 04:09:16,510
That person waits for the 5 of them!!

6609
04:09:12,310 --> 04:09:16,910
After this, that person will strike

6610
04:09:18,550 --> 04:09:20,510
11pm

6611
04:09:20,710 --> 04:09:23,410
Finally, the moment arrives

6612
04:09:23,610 --> 04:09:25,250
Hey, could I get some wat-

6613
04:09:28,410 --> 04:09:33,580
Emergency incident

6614
04:09:28,410 --> 04:09:40,310
Indoor Announcer

6615
04:09:29,850 --> 04:09:33,580
Stay indoors now

6616
04:09:31,380 --> 04:09:33,580
A prison escape has occurred in the facility

6617
04:09:33,910 --> 04:09:40,280
People who are indoors

6618
04:09:35,150 --> 04:09:40,310
must report for immediate roll-call

6619
04:09:37,050 --> 04:09:40,310
Gather at the gym

6620
04:09:39,110 --> 04:09:40,980
Gather at the gym?

6621
04:09:42,810 --> 04:09:47,010
Itao ran away, but nothing happened...

6622
04:09:46,310 --> 04:09:48,310
Let's head to the gym

6623
04:09:48,550 --> 04:09:54,810
Go to the gym for roll-call

6624
04:09:48,550 --> 04:09:54,810
Prison escape occurred

6625
04:09:50,580 --> 04:09:55,580
Itao ran away but nothing happened.

6626
04:09:55,710 --> 04:10:00,810
Gym

6627
04:09:58,280 --> 04:09:59,550
Wow

6628
04:09:58,280 --> 04:10:00,710
Wow

6629
04:09:59,650 --> 04:10:01,310
Yeah, awesome

6630
04:10:01,710 --> 04:10:08,980
Indoor prisoners are all gathered

6631
04:10:09,350 --> 04:10:11,510
Matsumoto, Hosei

6632
04:10:19,510 --> 04:10:26,080
Explanation of the situation from the jailer

6633
04:10:20,110 --> 04:10:22,280
Be quiet

6634
04:10:22,350 --> 04:10:26,810
Actually, in this prison, there has been an escape here.

6635
04:10:26,910 --> 04:10:29,310
There are a total of 15 escapees

6636
04:10:29,410 --> 04:10:32,180
To verify, I will now do a roll-call

6637
04:10:32,710 --> 04:10:34,780
First, in sequence we will beg- start from the first

6638
04:10:34,850 --> 04:10:35,750
First, in sequence we will beg- start from the first

6639
04:10:38,550 --> 04:10:40,510
GOD

6640
04:10:38,950 --> 04:10:40,510
DAMN

6641
04:10:41,410 --> 04:10:45,950
Chief jailer

6642
04:10:41,410 --> 04:10:45,950
Masahiro Chono barges in!!

6643
04:10:48,850 --> 04:10:50,510
Eh? That out is-

6644
04:10:53,980 --> 04:10:56,150
At the same time as the out

6645
04:10:57,110 --> 04:10:58,810
Just now there has been a prison escape

6646
04:10:58,850 --> 04:11:01,610
Just now there has been a prison escape

6647
04:11:02,510 --> 04:11:04,610
This is extremely upsetting!

6648
04:11:08,910 --> 04:11:12,110
There is a woman

6649
04:11:11,810 --> 04:11:18,950
A woman has given birth in the prison!!

6650
04:11:11,810 --> 04:11:18,950
Prison Escapee Information 1

6651
04:11:13,650 --> 04:11:17,210
who gave birth to a child in the prison

6652
04:11:19,550 --> 04:11:23,210
The biggest problem with this escape is

6653
04:11:23,410 --> 04:11:26,410
that someone helped them!

6654
04:11:26,510 --> 04:11:28,610
And now, I'm looking for the husband who can provide us with more information on them.

6655
04:11:28,610 --> 04:11:33,780
And now, I'm looking for the husband who can provide us with more information on them.

6656
04:11:31,980 --> 04:11:36,780
Prison Escapee Information 2

6657
04:11:31,980 --> 04:11:36,780
The man who helped them is here!!

6658
04:11:34,050 --> 04:11:37,580
Is he here in this place!?

6659
04:11:40,780 --> 04:11:43,980
Not here?

6660
04:11:44,280 --> 04:11:47,380
There is information that will provide a clue

6661
04:11:47,980 --> 04:11:54,450
1 more clue...

6662
04:11:48,780 --> 04:11:50,110
Oy!

6663
04:11:50,180 --> 04:11:53,080
Bring it here!

6664
04:12:02,580 --> 04:12:04,280
Oh yeah

6665
04:12:03,480 --> 04:12:05,380
What an awful series of events

6666
04:12:04,280 --> 04:12:06,980
It has started

6667
04:12:13,280 --> 04:12:16,380
This kid's name...

6668
04:12:17,650 --> 04:12:21,680
is Akio

6669
04:12:19,480 --> 04:12:24,280
Prison Escape Information 3

6670
04:12:19,480 --> 04:12:24,280
The baby's name is Akio

6671
04:12:21,780 --> 04:12:24,110
Children are honest

6672
04:12:24,210 --> 04:12:26,810
When held by their parents they always laugh

6673
04:12:26,810 --> 04:12:30,380
When held by their parents they always laugh

6674
04:12:31,750 --> 04:12:34,280
So nowone by one

6675
04:12:34,280 --> 04:12:36,350
So now one by one

6676
04:12:36,280 --> 04:12:38,580
hold the baby.

6677
04:12:38,980 --> 04:12:46,480
If Akio laughs, then proof of fatherhood

6678
04:12:38,980 --> 04:12:46,480
Investigating who aided the prison escape!!

6679
04:12:41,180 --> 04:12:46,250
End

6680
04:12:53,950 --> 04:12:55,050
All right.

6681
04:12:55,180 --> 04:12:57,510
Starting with you.

6682
04:12:58,910 --> 04:13:00,480
*Crying*

6683
04:13:00,080 --> 04:13:02,550
*Crying*

6684
04:13:02,250 --> 04:13:04,380
You’re not holding him right!!

6685
04:13:04,710 --> 04:13:12,250
The baby bawls if it isn’t the father

6686
04:13:05,710 --> 04:13:07,250
It’s not you.

6687
04:13:07,650 --> 04:13:08,150
Okay.

6688
04:13:10,850 --> 04:13:11,950
You’re next.

6689
04:13:11,950 --> 04:13:12,850
Yes.

6690
04:13:12,750 --> 04:13:13,550
Sorry.

6691
04:13:14,080 --> 04:13:15,710
*Crying*

6692
04:13:15,410 --> 04:13:17,680
*Crying*

6693
04:13:16,980 --> 04:13:19,980
It’s not you.

6694
04:13:24,810 --> 04:13:27,550
You’re a woman?

6695
04:13:27,880 --> 04:13:30,950
Let’s have you hold him, just in case.

6696
04:13:28,650 --> 04:13:30,850
I forgot about that.

6697
04:13:28,650 --> 04:13:30,850
Who would remember that?

6698
04:13:32,150 --> 04:13:33,850
I totally forgot.

6699
04:13:32,350 --> 04:13:33,850
*Crying*

6700
04:13:33,480 --> 04:13:35,810
*Crying*

6701
04:13:34,910 --> 04:13:37,550
Ain't you, either.

6702
04:13:38,050 --> 04:13:39,550
That'd actually be rude, though.

6703
04:13:42,010 --> 04:13:44,050
All right, you’re next!!

6704
04:13:43,780 --> 04:13:44,450
Yes.

6705
04:13:46,410 --> 04:13:48,050
*Crying*

6706
04:13:47,650 --> 04:13:49,610
*Crying*

6707
04:13:47,850 --> 04:13:50,650
It still makes you nervous, right?

6708
04:13:49,550 --> 04:13:51,010
*Crying*

6709
04:13:49,780 --> 04:13:51,180
It does, it does.

6710
04:13:51,080 --> 04:13:52,180
Really?

6711
04:13:52,110 --> 04:13:54,750
It’s not you.

6712
04:13:52,450 --> 04:13:55,150
I see.  If the baby laughs there.

6713
04:13:54,150 --> 04:13:56,950
By some sort of reversal.

6714
04:13:54,950 --> 04:13:56,950
Right up until that moment. Just a bit.

6715
04:13:56,350 --> 04:13:57,850
I see.

6716
04:13:56,610 --> 04:13:57,850
All right.

6717
04:13:59,280 --> 04:14:00,780
You...

6718
04:14:01,480 --> 04:14:03,350
are next!!

6719
04:14:04,010 --> 04:14:06,110
Can you hold him?

6720
04:14:09,280 --> 04:14:10,850
Hold him!!

6721
04:14:14,280 --> 04:14:15,980
*Laughing*

6722
04:14:16,310 --> 04:14:22,050
Akio gives a big laugh

6723
04:14:26,510 --> 04:14:29,180
Well, that’s right.

6724
04:14:32,780 --> 04:14:33,180
The husband of the escapee has been found!!

6725
04:14:33,180 --> 04:14:37,910
The husband of the escapee has been found!!

6726
04:14:38,780 --> 04:14:42,710
So it was you…

6727
04:14:44,710 --> 04:14:46,450
What is this, then?

6728
04:14:48,210 --> 04:14:49,850
This is not my chi...ji...child!!

6729
04:14:49,850 --> 04:14:53,450
This is not my chi...ji...child!!

6730
04:14:54,280 --> 04:14:56,950
Come on.  What is that?

6731
04:14:57,550 --> 04:14:58,950
That's where you twist your tongue?

6732
04:15:05,680 --> 04:15:07,680
It’s begun. This year, again.

6733
04:15:07,680 --> 04:15:08,950
It’s begun. This year, again.

6734
04:15:09,510 --> 04:15:10,180
Stand!! Come over here.

6735
04:15:10,180 --> 04:15:12,010
Stand!! Come over here.

6736
04:15:17,950 --> 04:15:20,680
That’s your child!!

6737
04:15:20,680 --> 04:15:23,780
His face is similar,

6738
04:15:22,680 --> 04:15:23,780
but it’s just a coincidence.

6739
04:15:23,780 --> 04:15:24,610
I pick...-ad up-a this child.

6740
04:15:24,610 --> 04:15:26,280
I pick...-ad up-a this child.

6741
04:15:26,280 --> 04:15:29,050
I pick...-ad up-a this child.

6742
04:15:29,050 --> 04:15:31,710
I was allowed to pick him up.

6743
04:15:31,980 --> 04:15:34,210
Get on the stage!!

6744
04:15:34,450 --> 04:15:36,450
What kind of explanation is that?

6745
04:15:39,080 --> 04:15:41,150
First, just get on here!!

6746
04:15:41,150 --> 04:15:43,150
But it’s really not mine.

6747
04:15:44,050 --> 04:15:44,280
Demanding an explanation on the stage!!

6748
04:15:44,280 --> 04:15:49,080
Demanding an explanation on the stage!!

6749
04:15:49,350 --> 04:15:51,580
What’s his name?

6750
04:15:52,080 --> 04:15:54,080
I don’t know this child.

6751
04:15:54,280 --> 04:15:56,780
Isn't it Akio?

6752
04:15:55,680 --> 04:15:56,780
I don't know.

6753
04:15:56,780 --> 04:15:59,980
You're the one who named him!!

6754
04:15:57,810 --> 04:15:59,980
I didn’t name him.  I don't know this child.

6755
04:16:00,280 --> 04:16:03,480
You named him!!

6756
04:16:00,810 --> 04:16:03,480
I didn’t!!

6757
04:16:03,950 --> 04:16:05,850
I don't know this child!!

6758
04:16:05,850 --> 04:16:08,680
Can I just leave him somewhere?

6759
04:16:08,680 --> 04:16:13,680
Are you capable of doing something like that?

6760
04:16:10,980 --> 04:16:13,680
I can't...

6761
04:16:15,180 --> 04:16:17,980
What the hell are you expressing?

6762
04:16:21,450 --> 04:16:22,710
What is this?

6763
04:16:23,450 --> 04:16:24,710
What the hell, man?

6764
04:16:24,710 --> 04:16:27,710
I got the emotions mixed up.

6765
04:16:27,980 --> 04:16:29,480
This child is innocent.

6766
04:16:29,480 --> 04:16:30,850
This child is innocent.

6767
04:16:30,850 --> 04:16:33,610
I can’t do anything if you’re with the child.

6768
04:16:33,610 --> 04:16:36,850
Give him to someone.

6769
04:16:35,080 --> 04:16:36,450
No, no.

6770
04:16:36,550 --> 04:16:37,450
No.

6771
04:16:37,480 --> 04:16:39,550
I will hold the child!!

6772
04:16:39,880 --> 04:16:45,580
"Akio" to be taken away
Preparations for the punishment

6773
04:16:39,880 --> 04:16:45,580
Hey.  Take the child and hold on to him.

6774
04:16:45,580 --> 04:16:46,580
Give him the child!!

6775
04:16:46,580 --> 04:16:47,780
No.

6776
04:16:48,280 --> 04:16:50,080
Hurry up, you!!

6777
04:16:48,980 --> 04:16:50,080
No!!

6778
04:16:50,080 --> 04:16:51,450
Hurry up, guy!

6779
04:16:50,650 --> 04:16:51,850
No!!

6780
04:16:51,850 --> 04:16:53,210
No!!

6781
04:16:53,750 --> 04:16:54,080
Stop it!!

6782
04:16:54,080 --> 04:16:55,150
Stop it!!

6783
04:16:55,150 --> 04:16:55,310
Stooop!!

6784
04:16:55,310 --> 04:16:56,710
Stooop!!

6785
04:16:56,710 --> 04:16:59,480
It’s dangerous.  It’s dangerous for the child.

6786
04:16:59,480 --> 04:17:01,810
All right.  Take the child away.

6787
04:17:03,350 --> 04:17:06,850
What are you doing?

6788
04:17:12,450 --> 04:17:15,450
“What are you doing?” he said.

6789
04:17:14,950 --> 04:17:18,450
He was asking genuinely,

6790
04:17:14,950 --> 04:17:18,450
“What are you doing?”

6791
04:17:20,680 --> 04:17:22,380
Guards!! Come on stage, all of you!!

6792
04:17:22,380 --> 04:17:23,950
Come up.  Team, gather up.

6793
04:17:23,950 --> 04:17:25,950
All right, everyone hold him.

6794
04:17:25,950 --> 04:17:28,250
This is turning into a huge fracas, come on!

6795
04:17:27,450 --> 04:17:28,450
Hosei!

6796
04:17:28,150 --> 04:17:30,450
This is turning into a huge fracas!!

6797
04:17:30,450 --> 04:17:31,480
All right.  The child.

6798
04:17:31,510 --> 04:17:31,780
Stop!!

6799
04:17:31,780 --> 04:17:32,080
Stop!!

6800
04:17:32,080 --> 04:17:34,310
Stop!!

6801
04:17:36,010 --> 04:17:38,750
Akiooo!!

6802
04:17:41,850 --> 04:17:43,050
What is this?

6803
04:17:43,050 --> 04:17:44,150
What is this?

6804
04:17:45,210 --> 04:17:47,780
What is the story that's going on here?

6805
04:17:48,850 --> 04:17:50,650
It’s because you didn’t let us take him.

6806
04:17:49,980 --> 04:17:51,680
Akiooo!!

6807
04:17:53,580 --> 04:17:53,980
The story has gotten out of whack!!

6808
04:17:53,980 --> 04:17:57,550
The story has gotten out of whack!!

6809
04:17:57,550 --> 04:18:00,180
So it is his child!!

6810
04:17:59,350 --> 04:18:00,050
Ready yourself.

6811
04:18:01,280 --> 04:18:05,310
The accomplice of the escapee gets the slap of punishment!!

6812
04:18:01,780 --> 04:18:02,680
Get up.

6813
04:18:05,850 --> 04:18:08,480
The same routine as always, now.

6814
04:18:08,880 --> 04:18:11,280
Seriously, it took a while to get here.

6815
04:18:11,280 --> 04:18:12,410
Face this way, you.

6816
04:18:12,950 --> 04:18:14,180
Please wait a second.

6817
04:18:14,180 --> 04:18:14,550
Yes.

6818
04:18:14,550 --> 04:18:14,580
Yes.

6819
04:18:14,580 --> 04:18:14,710
Yes.

6820
04:18:14,710 --> 04:18:14,880
Yes.

6821
04:18:14,880 --> 04:18:15,650
Yes.

6822
04:18:15,580 --> 04:18:16,750
Face this way!!

6823
04:18:16,750 --> 04:18:17,850
I’m sorry.

6824
04:18:17,780 --> 04:18:19,080
Face this way!

6825
04:18:20,710 --> 04:18:22,510
I’m scared.

6826
04:18:22,510 --> 04:18:23,550
I’m scared.

6827
04:18:23,910 --> 04:18:26,780
Sto~~p, please.

6828
04:18:26,110 --> 04:18:27,280
This is your fault!

6829
04:18:26,980 --> 04:18:27,410
No! Don't! No!!

6830
04:18:27,410 --> 04:18:27,580
No! Don't! No!!

6831
04:18:27,580 --> 04:18:28,610
No! Don't! No!!

6832
04:18:28,610 --> 04:18:28,810
No! Don't! No!!

6833
04:18:28,810 --> 04:18:29,780
No! Don't! No!!

6834
04:18:30,510 --> 04:18:33,550
Akiooo!!

6835
04:18:31,650 --> 04:18:33,580
Heeelp!!

6836
04:18:35,680 --> 04:18:37,380
Come on, what the hell?

6837
04:18:38,980 --> 04:18:41,210
Why are you asking Akio for help?

6838
04:18:44,780 --> 04:18:47,110
What the hell was that?

6839
04:18:45,180 --> 04:18:46,110
You can’t ask Akio for help.

6840
04:18:46,110 --> 04:18:49,380
You can’t ask Akio for help.

6841
04:18:47,710 --> 04:18:49,210
The child isn't here anymore.

6842
04:18:49,510 --> 04:18:52,710
Okay.

6843
04:18:50,580 --> 04:18:52,710
Can you just listen to my last request?

6844
04:18:52,880 --> 04:18:54,310
What is it?  You can ask, that's all.

6845
04:18:54,310 --> 04:18:55,850
What is it?  You can ask, that's all.

6846
04:18:56,150 --> 04:18:58,150
Please put Akio beside me.

6847
04:18:58,150 --> 04:18:59,580
Please put Akio beside me.

6848
04:18:59,580 --> 04:19:00,950
Please put Akio beside me.

6849
04:19:02,380 --> 04:19:04,110
Is Akio still here?

6850
04:19:04,680 --> 04:19:07,010
Can you bring him over?

6851
04:19:07,610 --> 04:19:08,880
Then, beside, here.

6852
04:19:10,210 --> 04:19:11,280
In front of Akio, got it?

6853
04:19:11,280 --> 04:19:13,580
In front of Akio, got it?

6854
04:19:13,680 --> 04:19:14,680
All right.  Come over here.

6855
04:19:15,080 --> 04:19:16,180
All right.  Bring him over here.

6856
04:19:17,710 --> 04:19:20,810
All right.  Say one last thing to your child.

6857
04:19:21,410 --> 04:19:23,010
Akio, I wish you happiness in your prison life.

6858
04:19:23,010 --> 04:19:31,280
Akio, I wish you happiness in your prison life.

6859
04:19:25,410 --> 04:19:31,280
Akio, I wish you happiness in your prison life.

6860
04:19:33,480 --> 04:19:35,680
What, what was that?

6861
04:19:35,180 --> 04:19:38,480
“I wish you happiness in prison life.”

6862
04:19:38,510 --> 04:19:42,010
What the hell is that!?

6863
04:19:46,950 --> 04:19:48,250
Let’s do it.

6864
04:19:52,350 --> 04:19:53,950
Here it comes!!

6865
04:19:55,110 --> 04:19:56,050
What is it?

6866
04:19:56,050 --> 04:19:56,550
Here it comes! Get over here, further!

6867
04:19:56,550 --> 04:19:56,910
Here it comes! Get over here, further!

6868
04:19:56,910 --> 04:19:58,910
Here it comes! Get over here, further!

6869
04:20:00,280 --> 04:20:00,810
Don’t move, don’t move.

6870
04:20:00,810 --> 04:20:02,510
Don’t move, don’t move.

6871
04:20:06,210 --> 04:20:08,010
Here it comes!!

6872
04:20:11,410 --> 04:20:19,180
The slap of punishment strikes!!

6873
04:20:23,980 --> 04:20:28,680
Say something to your child.

6874
04:20:28,950 --> 04:20:31,380
Akio... I got slapped.

6875
04:20:31,380 --> 04:20:34,010
Akio... I got slapped.

6876
04:20:34,950 --> 04:20:37,650
*Laughing*

6877
04:20:38,050 --> 04:20:40,680
God

6878
04:20:38,580 --> 04:20:40,680
Damn!!

6879
04:20:58,750 --> 04:20:59,780
In the end, he made it his own son.

6880
04:20:59,780 --> 04:21:02,410
In the end, he made it his own son.

6881
04:21:03,380 --> 04:21:04,410
Seriously?

6882
04:21:03,980 --> 04:21:04,780
You’re bringing him?

6883
04:21:04,810 --> 04:21:07,950
You’re going to recognize him as your own child?

6884
04:21:07,950 --> 04:21:09,950
Is that going to be all right?

6885
04:21:10,010 --> 04:21:11,280
He was screaming, "Akio!  Akio!”

6886
04:21:11,280 --> 04:21:13,910
He was screaming, "Akio!  Akio!”

6887
04:21:14,510 --> 04:21:14,680
am    0:00

6888
04:21:14,710 --> 04:21:14,810
am    0:00

6889
04:21:14,810 --> 04:21:14,910
am    0:00

6890
04:21:14,910 --> 04:21:15,080
am    0:00

6891
04:21:14,950 --> 04:21:19,810
The date has changed, and prison life has past 15 hours.

6892
04:21:15,080 --> 04:21:15,250
am    0:00

6893
04:21:15,250 --> 04:21:19,910
am    0:00

6894
04:21:16,250 --> 04:21:19,910
15 hours and 30 minutes

6895
04:21:16,250 --> 04:21:19,910
Prison life

6896
04:21:21,810 --> 04:21:23,510
My ass hurts.

6897
04:21:25,280 --> 04:21:27,810
So you brought Akio back.

6898
04:21:33,780 --> 04:21:36,410
You put him down quite carelessly.

6899
04:21:44,080 --> 04:21:45,080
Hosei,

6900
04:21:45,850 --> 04:21:49,310
of Akio at the prison, so I'll take him.

6901
04:21:45,850 --> 04:21:49,310
we'll take care

6902
04:21:49,580 --> 04:21:51,880
Hehe

6903
04:21:52,310 --> 04:21:54,710

6905
04:21:58,210 --> 04:22:00,410
*Laughing*

6906
04:21:58,250 --> 04:22:00,410

It was Fujiwara? The father?

6914

It was Fujiwara? The father?

6915
04:22:14,450 --> 04:22:16,010
But he’s supposed to be a woman, so it makes no sense.

6916
04:22:16,010 --> 04:22:20,480
But he’s supposed to be a woman, so it makes no sense.

6917
04:22:23,280 --> 04:22:24,880
Then it can’t be that.

6918
04:22:24,480 --> 04:22:26,410
Yeah, since he's a woman too.

*TRANSLATOR NOTE: arasa is short for "around thirty"*

7207
04:32:31,710 --> 04:32:42,480
People who are 30 years and older are called "arasa", however

7208
04:32:36,180 --> 04:32:42,480

7236
04:33:22,980 --> 04:33:24,680

7341
04:36:10,350 --> 04:36:12,610

7352
04:36:27,510 --> 04:36:31,850
Going to release Hosei & Endo, but...

7353
04:36:27,880 --> 04:36:29,980
After attaining 2 pieces of the medal, the three guys

7354
04:36:29,980 --> 04:36:32,010
try to leave the room, but...

7355
04:36:32,310 --> 04:36:35,180
Why won't it open?

7356
04:36:33,680 --> 04:36:34,650
You're right

7357
04:36:35,650 --> 04:36:39,310
The door won't open...

7358
04:36:38,550 --> 04:36:39,810

7359
04:36:41,850 --> 04:36:43,010
You're joking right?

7365
04:36:52,810 --> 04:36:57,110
It stops right before it flattens them

7366
04:36:53,580 --> 04:36:54,680
What the hell?

7367
04:36:54,810 --> 04:36:57,110
Scary!

7368
04:36:57,250 --> 04:36:58,350

7374
04:37:06,810 --> 04:37:09,150

This is a relief

7568
04:42:31,780 --> 04:42:33,080
I feel relieved

7569
04:42:32,510 --> 04:42:33,980
Oh good

7570
04:42:33,980 --> 04:42:36,210
Yeah, we get it now

7571
04:42:36,210 --> 04:42:40,110
It's so cold, must be quite hard for you

7572
04:42:37,880 --> 04:42:39,350
So true

7573
04:42:38,750 --> 04:42:40,350
You must've been waiting a while

7574
04:42:40,680 --> 04:42:44,310
Who do you think I am?

7575
04:42:41,980 --> 04:42:44,310
You're Tamu-Ken!!*

7576
04:42:42,250 --> 04:42:43,910
You're Tamuken.*

7577
04:42:42,250 --> 04:42:44,910
*Note: Tamuken refers to comedian Tamura Kenji.

7578
04:42:43,480 --> 04:42:44,580
No!

7579
04:42:45,180 --> 04:42:46,050
It's me.

7580
04:42:45,680 --> 04:42:48,710
An Ally of Justice?

7581
04:42:45,680 --> 04:42:48,710
An Ally of Justice?

7582
04:42:45,680 --> 04:42:48,710
Tamura Kenji

7583
04:42:45,680 --> 04:42:48,710
Tamura Kenji

7584
04:42:47,910 --> 04:42:49,050
It's Tamuken.

7585
04:42:49,210 --> 04:42:50,750
He was right.

7586
04:42:51,350 --> 04:42:53,280
What the hell are you doing?

7587
04:42:52,280 --> 04:42:53,980
Ask yourself that!!

7588
04:42:54,380 --> 04:42:57,010
I’ll help you!!

7589
04:42:56,050 --> 04:42:57,810
Really?

7590
04:42:56,050 --> 04:42:57,810
You’re going to help us?

7591
04:42:58,050 --> 04:43:01,050
Lion dance

7592
04:43:01,050 --> 04:43:02,810
Lion dance

7593
04:43:02,810 --> 04:43:04,310
Lion dance

7594
04:43:04,310 --> 04:43:05,610
The last one is Asada Mai!!*

7595
04:43:04,310 --> 04:43:06,610
*Note: Asada Mai is a figure skater.

7596
04:43:05,610 --> 04:43:06,810
Bam!

7597
04:43:07,480 --> 04:43:10,210
The last move wasn’t Asada Mai though.  It was the lion dance.

7598
04:43:11,610 --> 04:43:13,250
To be precise, yeah.

7599
04:43:13,410 --> 04:43:15,450
Isn't this really funny?

7600
04:43:17,480 --> 04:43:18,050
This?

7601
04:43:18,810 --> 04:43:20,410
It is curious.

7602
04:43:20,850 --> 04:43:22,980
Do you remember?  It was all the rage.

7603
04:43:22,980 --> 04:43:25,050
Come on, 2007.

7604
04:43:26,780 --> 04:43:28,280
I really don’t know.

7605
04:43:28,680 --> 04:43:30,580
When Yamamoto Mona*

7606
04:43:28,680 --> 04:43:35,580
*Note: Yamamoto Mona is a tarento who in 2006 was caught having an affair with married politician Hosono Goshi.  After spending some time away from the public eye, she returned to TV in 2007.

7607
04:43:30,580 --> 04:43:32,180
emerged from exile

7608
04:43:32,180 --> 04:43:34,980
and hosted Owarai Ultra Quiz, she wore this.

7609
04:43:33,980 --> 04:43:45,380
Yamamoto Mona

7610
04:43:35,980 --> 04:43:38,450
She wore this.  Wasn’t that really funny?

7611
04:43:38,450 --> 04:43:39,680
You’re right, now that you remind us.

7612
04:43:39,680 --> 04:43:42,510
Since then, she hasn’t used this, so I took it!!

7613
04:43:42,510 --> 04:43:43,780
From her, directly?

7614
04:43:43,780 --> 04:43:46,750
Well, I didn’t confirm it with her directly.

7615
04:43:45,580 --> 04:43:47,710
Are you going to escape?

7616
04:43:47,180 --> 04:43:48,710
Yes, yes we want to.

7617
04:43:47,880 --> 04:43:49,680
That's why we're here.

7618
04:43:48,710 --> 04:43:50,150
Well, yeah, that's what this is.

7619
04:43:50,150 --> 04:43:51,310
I’ll take you!!

7620
04:43:51,980 --> 04:43:52,980
Let's go.

7621
04:43:52,050 --> 04:43:58,410
With Tamuken’s guidance, they head to the escape point

7622
04:43:52,050 --> 04:43:58,410
m 6 0 l 556.5 0 b 562.5 0 562.5 1.5 562.5 12 l 562.5 12 b 562.5 35.875 562.5 37.375 556.5 37.375 l 4.5 37.375 b 0 37.375 0 35.875 0 12 b 0 1.5 0 0 6 0

7623
04:43:52,680 --> 04:43:53,980
His role is this important?

7624
04:43:54,980 --> 04:43:56,650
Then let's go.

7625
04:43:56,980 --> 04:43:58,850
Just leave the horse?

7626
04:43:58,850 --> 04:44:00,780
The horse is fine.  I’ve told-ah them about it!!

7627
04:44:01,110 --> 04:44:01,850
Told-ah?

7628
04:44:01,510 --> 04:44:02,180
Told-ah?

7629
04:44:03,110 --> 04:44:06,780
Telephone Booth

7630
04:44:03,110 --> 04:44:06,780
Telephone Booth

7631
04:44:04,580 --> 04:44:06,080
Hey, something’s written there.

7632
04:44:06,780 --> 04:44:11,650
One person shall

7633
04:44:06,780 --> 04:44:11,650
and wait for instructions!!

7634
04:44:06,780 --> 04:44:11,650
enter the telephone booth

7635
04:44:07,350 --> 04:44:10,080
One person shall enter the telephone booth

7636
04:44:10,080 --> 04:44:12,450
and wait for instructions.

7637
04:44:12,310 --> 04:44:18,250
Discussion over who enters

7638
04:44:12,310 --> 04:44:18,250
m 6 0 l 556.5 0 b 562.5 0 562.5 1.5 562.5 12 l 562.5 12 b 562.5 35.875 562.5 37.375 556.5 37.375 l 4.5 37.375 b 0 37.375 0 35.875 0 12 b 0 1.5 0 0 6 0

7639
04:44:13,110 --> 04:44:14,310
Well…

7640
04:44:13,110 --> 04:44:14,310
What?

7641
04:44:15,110 --> 04:44:15,850
Who’s good at this?

7642
04:44:16,850 --> 04:44:18,450
There's no good or bad at this.

7643
04:44:18,450 --> 04:44:20,710
The person who would fit just right in there

7644
04:44:20,710 --> 04:44:22,710
would be you, Tamura.

7645
04:44:20,780 --> 04:44:22,680
Why don’t you go?

7646
04:44:21,550 --> 04:44:22,380
Oh, yeah.

7647
04:44:22,380 --> 04:44:22,680
Yes.

7648
04:44:22,680 --> 04:44:25,850
Me?  No.  You're the prison escapees.  You're the ones who have to do this.

7649
04:44:25,850 --> 04:44:27,610
But as long as one person…

7650
04:44:26,310 --> 04:44:28,610
No, I don’t think there’s any rule like that.

7651
04:44:29,850 --> 04:44:33,710
Do you want me to hold the lion dance mask?

7652
04:44:31,510 --> 04:44:32,850
I got it.

7653
04:44:33,450 --> 04:44:34,080
Yeah, yeah.

7654
04:44:33,550 --> 04:44:34,080
Okay.

7655
04:44:34,080 --> 04:44:34,510
Yeah.

7656
04:44:34,210 --> 04:44:41,810
After discussion, Tamuken to go inside

7657
04:44:34,210 --> 04:44:41,810
m 6 0 l 556.5 0 b 562.5 0 562.5 1.5 562.5 12 l 562.5 12 b 562.5 35.875 562.5 37.375 556.5 37.375 l 4.5 37.375 b 0 37.375 0 35.875 0 12 b 0 1.5 0 0 6 0

7658
04:44:34,850 --> 04:44:35,850
Get the instructions.

7659
04:44:36,550 --> 04:44:38,580
Really?  I can do it?

7660
04:44:38,380 --> 04:44:39,950
Shouldn’t you take the watermelon off?

7661
04:44:39,950 --> 04:44:40,850
Yeah, you should take it off.

7662
04:44:40,480 --> 04:44:41,310
Really?

7663
04:44:41,550 --> 04:44:42,450
Yeah, there you go.

7664
04:44:43,250 --> 04:44:44,510
So you prepared your head just in case.

7665
04:44:44,510 --> 04:44:45,880
You styled your hair!!

7666
04:44:45,780 --> 04:44:46,980
He’s serious.

7667
04:44:47,410 --> 04:44:49,450
I can really do it?  Ow!!

7668
04:44:49,780 --> 04:44:53,210
Jagged gravel

7669
04:44:52,550 --> 04:44:54,110
Well, yeah, that would happen.

7670
04:44:55,010 --> 04:44:58,910
The phone will probably ring, if it’s the same set up as always.

7671
04:44:57,680 --> 04:44:58,950
Give the instructions.

7672
04:44:58,950 --> 04:44:59,450
Okay.

7673
04:44:59,410 --> 04:45:00,180
This turned out well.

7674
04:45:00,180 --> 04:45:01,610
Yeah, it really did.

7675
04:45:02,680 --> 04:45:03,650
There it is.

7676
04:45:03,010 --> 04:45:07,010
A call comes in to the public telephone

7677
04:45:03,010 --> 04:45:07,010
m 6 0 l 556.5 0 b 562.5 0 562.5 1.5 562.5 12 l 562.5 12 b 562.5 35.875 562.5 37.375 556.5 37.375 l 4.5 37.375 b 0 37.375 0 35.875 0 12 b 0 1.5 0 0 6 0

7678
04:45:04,410 --> 04:45:05,410
He’s shaking.

7679
04:45:05,410 --> 04:45:06,150
Pick it up.

7680
04:45:06,150 --> 04:45:07,410
Just from the ringing.

7681
04:45:08,410 --> 04:45:09,050
Yes?

7682
04:45:09,750 --> 04:45:14,010
Hello.  Is this the owner of the barbecue restaurant that’s deep in the red?

7683
04:45:09,750 --> 04:45:14,010
Other speaker
on the phone

7684
04:45:14,010 --> 04:45:16,410
It’s not in the red.  It’s doing fine.

7685
04:45:16,880 --> 04:45:19,280
Your financial bubble has already burst!!

7686
04:45:16,880 --> 04:45:23,580
Other speaker
on the phone

7687
04:45:17,880 --> 04:45:23,580
Countdown to a
Secret Event

7688
04:45:17,880 --> 04:45:23,580
Countdown to a
Secret Event

7689
04:45:19,280 --> 04:45:20,450
It hasn’t burst.

7690
04:45:22,810 --> 04:45:23,450
They hung up.

7691
04:45:24,180 --> 04:45:25,410
They hung up?

7692
04:45:27,680 --> 04:45:33,550
The door locks & in comes a massive amount of bubbles

7693
04:45:27,680 --> 04:45:33,550
m 6 0 l 556.5 0 b 562.5 0 562.5 1.5 562.5 12 l 562.5 12 b 562.5 35.875 562.5 37.375 556.5 37.375 l 4.5 37.375 b 0 37.375 0 35.875 0 12 b 0 1.5 0 0 6 0

7694
04:45:29,910 --> 04:45:31,010
Bubbles!

7695
04:45:31,410 --> 04:45:32,110
I see.

7696
04:45:32,110 --> 04:45:33,410
Oh, yeah.

7697
04:45:34,280 --> 04:45:37,950
What is this!?  It’s gentle!

7698
04:45:37,950 --> 04:45:40,750
There’s nothing to this.  I don't feel a thing!!

7699
04:45:42,710 --> 04:45:44,550
I think it’d be really uncomfortable.

7700
04:45:44,750 --> 04:45:48,280
Since the door has been locked, he cannot get out on his own

7701
04:45:44,750 --> 04:45:48,280
Since the door has been locked, he cannot get out on his own

7702
04:45:45,450 --> 04:45:46,450
Whoa, whoa, whoa.

7703
04:45:47,080 --> 04:45:48,650
You can’t get out.

7704
04:45:49,450 --> 04:45:51,050
There are more bubbles coming.

7705
04:45:51,710 --> 04:45:54,550
Door unlocked

7706
04:45:51,710 --> 04:45:54,550
m 6 0 l 556.5 0 b 562.5 0 562.5 1.5 562.5 12 l 562.5 12 b 562.5 35.875 562.5 37.375 556.5 37.375 l 4.5 37.375 b 0 37.375 0 35.875 0 12 b 0 1.5 0 0 6 0

7707
04:45:52,010 --> 04:45:53,410
Something's definitely strange.

7708
04:45:55,150 --> 04:45:56,950
Whoa.

7709
04:45:58,410 --> 04:45:59,110
Wow.

7710
04:46:00,910 --> 04:46:01,980
With all the bubbles...

7711
04:46:03,110 --> 04:46:04,410
there’s no oxygen anymore.

7712
04:46:04,080 --> 04:46:05,010
Right.

7713
04:46:05,280 --> 04:46:08,750
I thought I was gonna die.

7714
04:46:09,980 --> 04:46:11,350
When you thought it was about time to come out,

7715
04:46:11,350 --> 04:46:13,550
you couldn’t open the door and panicked!!

7716
04:46:13,810 --> 04:46:15,210
That’s a lot of soap bubbles.

7717
04:46:15,210 --> 04:46:16,550
I thought there was a malfunction.

7718
04:46:18,010 --> 04:46:20,880
I thought there was a malfunction.

7719
04:46:21,680 --> 04:46:24,180
It suddenly got scary, right? But for you, instead of us.

7720
04:46:24,210 --> 04:46:27,550
What the hell!?

7721
04:46:26,680 --> 04:46:32,010
A group of prisoners capture Tamuken

7722
04:46:26,680 --> 04:46:32,010

7723
04:46:28,550 --> 04:46:32,310
What are you doing?  Help!

7724
04:46:32,310 --> 04:46:33,380
I wasn’t told about this!!

7725
04:46:33,380 --> 04:46:35,880
The plan was for me to keep going after this!!

7726
04:46:36,750 --> 04:46:37,750
Then, we’ll

7727
04:46:37,750 --> 04:46:41,550
just go in the direction of the arrows.

7728
04:46:38,750 --> 04:46:40,210
All we can do is just keep going.

7729
04:46:39,750 --> 04:46:41,780
I’ll leave this over here, then.

7730
04:46:41,180 --> 04:46:44,250
At one point, he was really seriously trying to get the door open!!

7731
04:46:43,080 --> 04:46:44,550
He was serious.

7732
04:46:44,910 --> 04:46:50,250
He tried to open it like a grown man!!

7733
04:46:47,380 --> 04:46:50,250
Yes, since it wouldn't open at all.

7734
04:46:53,380 --> 04:46:55,250
3 AM.

7735
04:46:57,210 --> 04:47:03,680
The men were forced to experience prison life…

7736
04:46:57,210 --> 04:47:03,680
The men were forced to experience prison life…

7737
04:46:58,610 --> 04:47:00,110
For some reason this year,

7738
04:47:00,110 --> 04:47:04,610
the five men were forced to experience prison life.

7739
04:47:04,950 --> 04:47:10,750
After overcoming all the trials…

7740
04:47:04,950 --> 04:47:10,750
After overcoming all the trials…

7741
04:47:06,950 --> 04:47:10,650
After overcoming all the trials…

7742
04:47:11,280 --> 04:47:15,380
That moment has finally come...

7743
04:47:11,280 --> 04:47:15,380
That moment has finally come...

7744
04:47:11,450 --> 04:47:13,650
Now, they approach that moment.

7745
04:47:25,210 --> 04:47:25,850
Here we go.

7746
04:47:26,010 --> 04:47:27,750
Everyone, be happy.

7747
04:47:27,780 --> 04:47:29,280
You are all to be released!!

7748
04:47:29,010 --> 04:47:31,780
Yes!

7749
04:47:31,780 --> 04:47:33,880
Now, each of you is a free man!!

7750
04:47:33,880 --> 04:47:36,580
Yes.

7751
04:47:33,980 --> 04:47:35,380
Good for you all.

7752
04:47:37,880 --> 04:47:38,980
Hamada.

7753
04:47:38,580 --> 04:47:39,280
Yes.

7754
04:47:38,980 --> 04:47:40,150
How was it?

7755
04:47:40,610 --> 04:47:44,050
We seriously gave it all we got...

7756
04:47:44,050 --> 04:47:48,750
but Toshi-chan (Tahara Toshihiko) really gave me trouble.

7757
04:47:48,750 --> 04:47:51,250
Matsumoto!!

7758
04:47:50,080 --> 04:47:54,380
I really say this every time, but there's a lot of misjudging and honestly, I think the others

7759
04:47:54,380 --> 04:47:59,080
should have been smacked more.  There are always 10 or 20 times where

7760
04:47:59,080 --> 04:48:02,850
I don’t think I needed to be smacked.

7761
04:48:02,850 --> 04:48:05,250
Everyone should

7762
04:48:05,250 --> 04:48:07,280
pay attention to Hamada more

7763
04:48:07,280 --> 04:48:09,910
and make sure his are never missed!!

7764
04:48:09,910 --> 04:48:11,780
Those are my thoughts.

7765
04:48:13,910 --> 04:48:14,780
Let’s go then.

7766
04:48:15,710 --> 04:48:17,210
It’s cold out,

7767
04:48:17,210 --> 04:48:18,080
so everyone wear these.

7768
04:48:18,080 --> 04:48:19,210
Ah, my behind hurts.

7769
04:48:19,250 --> 04:48:24,050
Are we going to be told in the end why we were arrested?

7770
04:48:21,150 --> 04:48:24,280
Yes, we still don’t know in the end.

7771
04:48:21,310 --> 04:48:22,680
That’s true.

7772
04:48:24,050 --> 04:48:26,850
And who’s going to raise the child?

7773
04:48:26,980 --> 04:48:28,580
That’s right.

7774
04:48:27,010 --> 04:48:29,180
What’re you gonna do with Akio?

7775
04:48:29,180 --> 04:48:32,310
Akio will be looked after at the prison!!

7776
04:48:31,980 --> 04:48:33,310
At the prison?

7777
04:48:32,680 --> 04:48:35,310
I want to meet Akio when he’s grown up!!

7778
04:48:35,650 --> 04:48:40,580
Since we’re released, that means it’s 2015 now!!

7779
04:48:35,650 --> 04:48:42,610
Prison Entrance

7780
04:48:41,480 --> 04:48:43,510
The new year has arrived.

7781
04:48:43,510 --> 04:48:45,010
That’s right.

7782
04:48:45,310 --> 04:48:47,110
Can you, over here...

7783
04:48:48,110 --> 04:48:49,380
Can you line up over here?

7784
04:48:49,410 --> 04:48:51,210
Happy New Year!!

7785
04:48:51,210 --> 04:48:53,880
Happy New Year!!

7786
04:48:53,910 --> 04:48:57,110
Suga Kenji   General Manager

7787
04:48:53,910 --> 04:48:57,110
Suga Kenji   General Manager

7788
04:48:53,910 --> 04:48:57,110
The Legendary Prison Director

7789
04:48:53,910 --> 04:48:57,110
The Legendary Prison Director

7790
04:48:54,210 --> 04:48:56,880
This year is the year of the sheep.

7791
04:48:57,350 --> 04:48:59,810
If I could have Master Tsukitei* lead the call.

7792
04:48:57,350 --> 04:49:01,810
*Note: Referring to Tsukitei Hosei recently gaining official credentials as a rakugo performer (traditional Japanese one-man verbal comedy).

7793
04:49:00,350 --> 04:49:02,510
A sya-ah-llable sentence composition with “Hitsuji Doshi (Year of the Sheep)”

7794
04:49:03,150 --> 04:49:05,250
I would like to conclude the year in this way.

7795
04:49:03,850 --> 04:49:08,380
Hitsuji Doshi (Year of the Sheep)

7796
04:49:03,850 --> 04:49:08,380
Syllable Sentence Composition* with

7797
04:49:03,850 --> 04:49:08,380
m 0 0 l 0 88.375 l 1200 91.375 l 1200 -1.5

7798
04:49:03,850 --> 04:49:08,380
m 6 0 l 556.5 0 b 562.5 0 562.5 1.5 562.5 12 l 562.5 12 b 562.5 71.875 562.5 73.375 556.5 73.375 l 4.5 73.375 b 0 73.375 0 71.875 0 12 b 0 1.5 0 0 6 0

7799
04:49:03,850 --> 04:49:11,380
*Note: Syllable sentence composition (A-i-u-e-o Sakubun, or acrostic poem to us westerners) is a word game in which the syllables of a topic word are broken up and the composer composes a phrase that starts with each syllable.  The phrases taken together should have an overarching theme that builds up to the final phrase, which is the most important line and acts as a punchline.

7800
04:49:04,110 --> 04:49:05,380
You messed up your line.

7801
04:49:06,280 --> 04:49:08,680
Master, if you will.  Hitsuji Doshi.

7802
04:49:08,680 --> 04:49:09,950
And now,

7803
04:49:09,950 --> 04:49:12,450
Hitsuji doshi: Hi

7804
04:49:12,610 --> 04:49:14,480
Through the wide world

7805
04:49:14,780 --> 04:49:15,950
Tsu

7806
04:49:16,280 --> 04:49:18,350
Finally will fly

7807
04:49:18,850 --> 04:49:20,350
Ji

7808
04:49:20,350 --> 04:49:22,550
The 5 of them, with outstanding ability

7809
04:49:23,250 --> 04:49:24,350
Do

7810
04:49:24,350 --> 04:49:26,250
With more and more gigs

7811
04:49:27,080 --> 04:49:27,950
Shi

7812
04:49:27,950 --> 04:49:29,710
Shieeeh!!*

7813
04:49:27,950 --> 04:49:31,710
*Note: A gag made famous by the character Iyami in the manga Osamatsu-kun.

7814
04:49:32,710 --> 04:49:34,380
Thank you, and see you next year.

7815
04:49:32,710 --> 04:49:34,380
What the hell?

7816
04:49:37,880 --> 04:49:39,710
When he did the Shieeeh, his pivot leg was…

7817
04:49:38,910 --> 04:49:41,210
Is it that hard to stand like that?

7818
04:49:40,480 --> 04:49:42,210
He couldn’t maintain it at all.

7819
04:49:50,450 --> 04:49:53,010
We're finally done.

7820
04:49:52,310 --> 04:50:00,080
Endō Shōzō

7821
04:49:52,310 --> 04:50:00,080
Hamada Masatoshi

7822
04:49:52,310 --> 04:50:00,080
Matsumoto Hitoshi

7823
04:49:52,310 --> 04:50:00,080
Matsumoto Hitoshi

7824
04:49:52,310 --> 04:50:00,080
Matsumoto Hitoshi

7825
04:49:52,310 --> 04:50:00,080
Matsumoto Hitoshi

7826
04:49:52,310 --> 04:50:00,080
Number of times their butts were smacked

7827
04:49:52,310 --> 04:50:00,080
Tanaka Naoki

7828
04:49:52,310 --> 04:50:00,080
Tsukitei Hōsei

7829
04:49:53,010 --> 04:49:54,010
Yes, we’re done.

7830
04:49:55,550 --> 04:49:56,310
What, again?

7831
04:49:56,310 --> 04:50:00,010
Yes!

7832
04:50:01,250 --> 04:50:07,780
Yay! I'm glad we did it again this year

7833
04:50:01,250 --> 04:50:10,080
Hooray ~I'm Glad I Fell in Love with You~*

7834
04:50:01,250 --> 04:50:10,080
Ulfuls

7835
04:50:01,380 --> 04:50:07,780
*Note: The music is from "Hooray ~Thank Goodness I Fell in Love with You~" by Ulfuls, while the lyrics being sung have been changed to describe the episode’s events that happened.  The performers seen here are Ulfuls.

7836
04:50:07,780 --> 04:50:11,280
Happy that butts could be smacked on and on

7837
04:50:11,280 --> 04:50:16,150
Crime – you didn’t commit one.

7838
04:50:16,150 --> 04:50:19,950
But on and on,

7839
04:50:19,950 --> 04:50:24,510
the five in prison.

7840
04:50:25,380 --> 04:50:26,680
It's Ulfuls.

7841
04:50:25,380 --> 04:50:26,980
Guitar: Ulful Keisuke

7842
04:50:26,380 --> 04:50:27,680
Ulfuls.

7843
04:50:27,180 --> 04:50:28,880
Bass: John B.

7844
04:50:27,710 --> 04:50:29,380
They look good.

7845
04:50:28,980 --> 04:50:30,410
Drums: Sankon Jr.

7846
04:50:30,710 --> 04:50:32,210
Vocals: Tortoise Matsumoto

7847
04:50:32,610 --> 04:50:37,710
On a pointless journey, give D (Matsuko Deluxe) trouble

7848
04:50:37,550 --> 04:50:42,650
The more I think about it, the more it hurts

7849
04:50:42,650 --> 04:50:46,850
The jokes of the duos who kept laughing

7850
04:50:46,950 --> 04:50:53,280
Were Anna and Rola's rip off skits

7851
04:50:53,280 --> 04:50:58,150
I don't want to see uncool macho men

7852
04:50:58,150 --> 04:51:03,650
Just like how that mask that wouldn't come off

7853
04:51:03,650 --> 04:51:08,510
I don't want to see Kida's butt

7854
04:51:08,510 --> 04:51:13,010
That ass, baby, stop showing your ass

7855
04:51:13,010 --> 04:51:17,680
Yay! I'm glad that I love you

7856
04:51:17,680 --> 04:51:23,310
Tetsuya will keep on, keep on, saying yes until death

7857
04:51:23,310 --> 04:51:28,150
Hooray! I'm glad that we met Toshi

7858
04:51:28,150 --> 04:51:31,950
Staying in that little room, little room

7859
04:51:31,950 --> 04:51:35,110
La la la, just the both of them

7860
04:51:44,750 --> 04:51:49,710
Kizana Kiyoshi starts singing

7861
04:51:49,710 --> 04:51:55,250
Tokuma dances enthusiastically

7862
04:51:55,250 --> 04:52:00,050
Always want to mess around with comrades

7863
04:52:00,050 --> 04:52:04,910
Mimata, baby! Bring your crotch over

7864
04:52:04,910 --> 04:52:09,510
Yay! I'm glad that you got to drink water

7865
04:52:09,510 --> 04:52:14,950
Ebisu's panty that he's worn for a long, long time

7866
04:52:14,950 --> 04:52:19,780
*Translator's Notes: "Dosukoi" is a sumo wrestler's exclamation/shout

7867
04:52:14,950 --> 04:52:19,780
Dosukoi*! Your slap was so good

7868
04:52:19,780 --> 04:52:28,750
Let's just stay, stay and expose secrets

7869
04:52:41,380 --> 04:52:46,410
Akio, baby! Baby!

7870
04:52:46,410 --> 04:52:51,250
Stay, stay, stay by my side

7871
04:52:51,250 --> 04:52:55,850
Yay! I'm glad he spreads his body

7872
04:52:55,850 --> 04:53:01,450
Until death, always, always, naked and happy

7873
04:53:01,450 --> 04:53:06,250
Hooray! Glad that we escaped from prison

7874
04:53:06,250 --> 04:53:10,110
Finally this year, this year

7875
04:53:10,110 --> 04:53:13,980
Yay! I'm glad it's the new year

7876
04:53:13,980 --> 04:53:19,480
From now on, let's keep, keep, smiling and be happy

7877
04:53:19,480 --> 04:53:24,150
Hooray! There weren't any serious injuries

7878
04:53:24,150 --> 04:53:34,680
Gaki will always, always, be the 5 of them

7879
04:53:35,150 --> 04:53:40,810
We wish you another year
that overflows with laughter

7880
04:53:41,550 --> 04:53:42,880
So

7881
04:53:43,080 --> 04:53:46,880
That's the end, but we've already entered the new year

7882
04:53:46,780 --> 04:53:47,950
Happy New Year

7883
04:53:46,880 --> 04:53:48,680
Happy New Year

7884
04:53:47,450 --> 04:53:49,910
Happy New Year

7885
04:53:51,810 --> 04:53:54,150
The ending was performed by Ulfuls

7886
04:53:53,350 --> 04:53:54,680
Yeah, that was great

7887
04:53:53,980 --> 04:53:56,410
Yeah

7888
04:53:54,950 --> 04:53:56,610
It was good, wasn't it?

7889
04:53:57,050 --> 04:54:01,210
Next year maybe it could be a good idea to allow laughing instead

7890
04:54:02,380 --> 04:54:05,010
Then it will just be like any other day, wouldn't it?

7891
04:54:04,680 --> 04:54:07,080
Yeah, yeah, it would

7892
04:54:06,110 --> 04:54:08,350
It'll be just another ordinary day

7893
04:54:08,010 --> 04:54:08,780
At last

7894
04:54:08,810 --> 04:54:12,150
Perhaps, this year's chief of buzzwords will now be...

7895
04:54:15,380 --> 04:54:17,480
Endo Shozo

7896
04:54:16,910 --> 04:54:18,380
Sounds about right

7897
04:54:18,380 --> 04:54:22,380
After you say your piece, I'll say our farewell

7898
04:54:21,350 --> 04:54:22,580
Yes, understood

7899
04:54:22,650 --> 04:54:24,210
