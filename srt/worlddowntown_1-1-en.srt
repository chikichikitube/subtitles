2
00:00:13,630 --> 00:00:19,300
How is everyone? This is a news show that introduces many things from around the world.

3
00:00:19,300 --> 00:00:21,270
I'm the anchor, Giles Besson.

4
00:00:21,270 --> 00:00:26,700
Around 400 years ago on this day, Musashi and Kojiro had their legendary sword fight at Ganryuji.

5
00:00:26,700 --> 00:00:29,250
What's happening around the world today?

6
00:00:29,250 --> 00:00:32,720
Let's ask our panel.

7
00:00:32,720 --> 00:00:37,220
First, let's turn to our economic analyst from New York, Ghorchyan Afshin. Hi, Ghorchyan!

8
00:00:37,210 --> 00:00:38,410
Hi, Giles!

9
00:00:38,410 --> 00:00:42,120
Thanks for asking me to join you on the inception of this great show.

10
00:00:42,120 --> 00:00:45,970
Thanks for coming from so far to join us.

11
00:00:45,970 --> 00:00:48,220
We're awaiting your sharp analysis of economical news!

12
00:00:48,220 --> 00:00:49,370
Of course.

13
00:00:49,370 --> 00:00:53,580
Andn ow the Youth Org. Chairperson, Natalia Bazarova, Hi Natalia!

14
00:00:53,580 --> 00:00:55,680
Hi, Giles!

15
00:00:55,680 --> 00:00:58,380
You look beautiful, as usual.

16
00:00:58,380 --> 00:01:04,590
Thanks. I want to focus on the energetic eyes of Asian children.

17
00:01:04,590 --> 00:01:06,590
Excellent!

18
00:01:04,590 --> 00:01:06,640
She's been practicing that line.

19
00:01:06,640 --> 00:01:09,590
That's such a cute opinion.

20
00:01:09,590 --> 00:01:12,650
Let's do lunch some time.

21
00:01:13,300 --> 00:01:15,700
OK, I'll think about it.

22
00:01:17,050 --> 00:01:20,710
Next, Japan's greatest comedian, Masatoshi HamaTA

23
00:01:21,060 --> 00:01:23,360
Ah, thank you. Good evening!

24
00:01:23,360 --> 00:01:24,960
Excellent!

25
00:01:25,810 --> 00:01:29,960
I'm awaiting your funny reactions!

26
00:01:29,960 --> 00:01:31,590
Ok.

27
00:01:32,970 --> 00:01:35,470
And Hamata's sidekick, Hitoshi Matsumoto!

28
00:01:36,120 --> 00:01:37,720
Thanks, good evening-

29
00:01:37,720 --> 00:01:39,220
Oh!

30
00:01:39,220 --> 00:01:42,130
Matsumoto, you look ilke Ken Watanabe from "The Last Samurai!"

31
00:01:49,780 --> 00:01:51,780
Totally the same!

32
00:01:51,990 --> 00:01:53,540
That was hilarious!

33
00:01:54,690 --> 00:01:58,490
Giles, that was funny!

34
00:01:56,490 --> 00:01:58,490
That funny?

35
00:02:01,750 --> 00:02:05,400
Just go along with them, I guess.

36
00:02:06,500 --> 00:02:10,510
Hamata, if you can think of something funny, go ahead.

37
00:02:11,210 --> 00:02:13,110
He called you "Hamata."

38
00:02:13,110 --> 00:02:14,660
It's "Hamada!"

39
00:02:13,460 --> 00:02:14,660
So, on to our news!

40
00:02:14,660 --> 00:02:16,810
Hey, It's "Hamada!"

41
00:02:14,660 --> 00:02:18,510
From the Philippines, Roberto Gabishan.

42
00:02:20,520 --> 00:02:23,970
Hi, I'm Roberto Gabishan from the Philippines.

43
00:02:23,970 --> 00:02:26,920
We have a weird cafe to show you.

44
00:02:26,920 --> 00:02:34,280
In this cafe, the owner gives a strange "service" to his customers.

45
00:02:34,280 --> 00:02:36,830
Let's go see what that service is!

46
00:02:36,830 --> 00:02:38,480
Come on!

47
00:02:39,730 --> 00:02:45,940
So, we ventured to the cafe "Mon Ama Rik."

48
00:02:45,940 --> 00:02:47,940
As we entered, the owner was waiting for us.

49
00:02:51,100 --> 00:02:54,200
The owner, Bong Omega, was waiting for us with another "service" to show us.

50
00:02:55,200 --> 00:03:00,060
Bong, what kind of service are you going to show us today?

51
00:03:00,060 --> 00:03:06,010
It is a totally free service! But there is one condition.

52
00:03:06,010 --> 00:03:10,930
If the customer's reaction is good, they get their food and drink for free!

53
00:03:10,930 --> 00:03:16,220
What kind of reaction? Look at this, whatdja think it is?

54
00:03:16,220 --> 00:03:20,230
Invented in Japan, it artificially simulates the sound of someone farting!

55
00:03:21,680 --> 00:03:24,130
That makes the sound of a fart?

56
00:03:24,130 --> 00:03:31,390
Yeah! Why don't you try it out? Just sit on it!

57
00:03:34,590 --> 00:03:36,990
I farted! I farted!

58
00:03:37,890 --> 00:03:40,350
It was a pretty good reaction, too!

59
00:03:40,350 --> 00:03:44,750
I start laughing at the reaction our customers will have when they sit on it!

60
00:03:53,360 --> 00:03:57,460
So we set up three hidden cameras in the cafe

61
00:03:57,460 --> 00:04:02,320
Bong and Roberto waited for their first victim.

62
00:04:02,320 --> 00:04:03,500
And then!

63
00:04:09,420 --> 00:04:11,630
Here she is! She's pretty hot, too!

64
00:04:37,250 --> 00:04:41,560
Hey there! Honestly, this was kind of a "candid camera."

65
00:04:49,510 --> 00:04:54,070
It was a great reaction! You can order anything you want for free!

66
00:04:55,920 --> 00:04:58,470
Next is a guy who's kind of scary.

67
00:05:03,180 --> 00:05:05,080
Here he comes!

68
00:05:14,840 --> 00:05:17,490
Hey there! Honestly, that fart was "candid camera."

69
00:05:17,490 --> 00:05:19,490
Did you really think you farted?

70
00:05:21,950 --> 00:05:23,950
Next, another guy.

71
00:05:27,250 --> 00:05:29,850
Wow, this guy looks pretty scary!

72
00:05:35,160 --> 00:05:36,910
He turned pink!

73
00:05:37,660 --> 00:05:40,020
You really surprised me!

74
00:05:40,670 --> 00:05:42,120
We thought so too!

75
00:05:42,520 --> 00:05:44,170
Next is a couple.

76
00:05:47,570 --> 00:05:50,080
Who's gonna fal for it? The boyfriend?

77
00:05:59,380 --> 00:06:02,940
Did you see that? What a reaction!

78
00:06:05,690 --> 00:06:06,940
What was that sound?

79
00:06:06,940 --> 00:06:08,090
It wasn't me!

80
00:06:09,890 --> 00:06:12,750
He said "it wasn't me," better help him out!

81
00:06:14,800 --> 00:06:16,250
Was that really what happened?

82
00:06:16,850 --> 00:06:20,960
So today we introduced a mischevious cafe in the Philippines.

83
00:06:20,960 --> 00:06:24,460
Call us again when you have a good idea!

84
00:06:24,460 --> 00:06:29,060
I already figured one out! Next time you come

85
00:06:29,060 --> 00:06:35,020
it will make us famous all over the Philippines!

86
00:06:40,230 --> 00:06:42,080
Thanks, Gabishan.

87
00:06:42,080 --> 00:06:44,880
What did you think of that report, Ghorchyan?

88
00:06:44,880 --> 00:06:48,780
Well, America is focusing the most on the Philippines out of all of Asia

89
00:06:48,780 --> 00:06:52,190
but that shop owner was crazy!

90
00:06:52,190 --> 00:06:54,490
Thanks for your sharp opinion.

91
00:06:54,490 --> 00:06:55,790
How about you, Natalia?

92
00:06:55,790 --> 00:06:57,890
Well, I disagree.

93
00:06:57,890 --> 00:07:02,450
I think that the Philippino children look energetic and strong!

94
00:07:02,450 --> 00:07:04,350
Excellent!

95
00:07:04,750 --> 00:07:06,250
What about, you Hamata?

96
00:07:06,250 --> 00:07:07,650
It's "Hamada."

97
00:07:07,650 --> 00:07:09,900
That wasn't funny at all.

98
00:07:09,900 --> 00:07:11,360
I see.

99
00:07:11,360 --> 00:07:14,810
Why do they get so many laughs off such a lame reaction?

100
00:07:14,810 --> 00:07:17,560
Well, that's a different opinion.

101
00:07:17,560 --> 00:07:21,120
I guess Japanese Gay-nin don't get it.

102
00:07:22,970 --> 00:07:26,040
So next is Thailand...

103
00:07:26,040 --> 00:07:28,320
Just kidding, Matsumoto!

104
00:07:28,320 --> 00:07:30,180
I was pretending to ignore you!

105
00:07:30,180 --> 00:07:32,480
You can ignore me for all I care.

106
00:07:32,780 --> 00:07:39,180
But yeah, the laughs were pretty lame. Well...

107
00:07:39,180 --> 00:07:44,390
Well, when that happens, how do Japanese Gay-nin react?

108
00:07:44,390 --> 00:07:45,340
Hey!

109
00:07:51,950 --> 00:07:53,850
Holy shit this is lame!

110
00:07:53,850 --> 00:07:55,550
No one will laugh at this!

111
00:07:55,550 --> 00:07:58,250
Matsumoto, show us how a Japanese Gay-nin reacts!

112
00:07:58,850 --> 00:08:00,610
Man, this sucks!

113
00:08:00,610 --> 00:08:01,660
No way, no way-

114
00:08:01,660 --> 00:08:03,260
Wow!

115
00:08:11,320 --> 00:08:12,540
Hilarious!

116
00:08:12,540 --> 00:08:14,460
Funny as all hell!

117
00:08:14,460 --> 00:08:17,870
Japanese Gay-nin are the best!

118
00:08:19,120 --> 00:08:21,480
Stop calling us "Gay-nin."

119
00:08:21,480 --> 00:08:23,880
It's "Geinin."

120
00:08:23,880 --> 00:08:26,080
And now, we have a commercial.

121
00:08:26,080 --> 00:08:28,080
It's not "Gay-nin." It's "Geinin."

122
00:08:42,600 --> 00:08:47,700
Next, from the Philippines again, we have Robert Gabishan!

123
00:08:49,250 --> 00:08:52,210
Hi, this is Robert Gabishan, again.

124
00:08:54,110 --> 00:08:55,910
Why the hell did he bow?

125
00:08:58,460 --> 00:09:02,440
Next, we'll look at a store that gives away money!

126
00:09:02,440 --> 00:09:04,140
Could this be true?

127
00:09:04,140 --> 00:09:05,320
Let's go see!

128
00:09:06,070 --> 00:09:11,830
We went to downtown Cebu to see what was going on and found a long line. What's happening?

129
00:09:12,430 --> 00:09:15,730
Are you attending this event?

130
00:09:15,730 --> 00:09:22,790
Yeah! It's Awesome! If you try hard you can get a lot!

131
00:09:23,490 --> 00:09:27,190
Being able to get money for free is great!

132
00:09:27,840 --> 00:09:34,550
Boss, why are they all coming to your store for free money?

133
00:09:34,550 --> 00:09:39,400
Well, the economy has been bad and all. I thought this would be a good way to bring it back.

134
00:09:39,400 --> 00:09:45,960
I hadn't sold a single TV set, so I guessed if I got a lot of people in front of my shop, someone would buy something!

135
00:09:45,960 --> 00:09:54,770
I sell way more than I give away now!

136
00:09:55,470 --> 00:10:00,780
We wondered what this free money event was, so we watched...

137
00:10:06,180 --> 00:10:07,440
Good luck!

138
00:10:07,440 --> 00:10:08,330
Start!

139
00:10:10,090 --> 00:10:12,840
One peso...

140
00:10:12,840 --> 00:10:14,940
Two pesos...

141
00:10:14,940 --> 00:10:16,390
Three pesos...

142
00:10:16,390 --> 00:10:21,250
You get as many pennies as you can plug your nose with.

143
00:10:28,750 --> 00:10:31,760
That's all for you, they're slipping out. You get three!

144
00:10:33,010 --> 00:10:37,610
Next is a guy who has trained in the art of nostril stuffing.

145
00:10:37,610 --> 00:10:39,760
Wow! He's stuffing a load in there!

146
00:10:43,370 --> 00:10:45,780
He stuffs a load in...

147
00:10:45,780 --> 00:10:46,860
However!

148
00:10:57,030 --> 00:10:58,540
I'm done!

149
00:11:03,440 --> 00:11:05,960
He stuck them so far in that they won't come out!

150
00:11:14,900 --> 00:11:17,100
You did a great job!

151
00:11:17,400 --> 00:11:21,660
That's right, I got 17 pesos!

152
00:11:21,660 --> 00:11:24,690
I'm going for the record next time!

153
00:11:25,310 --> 00:11:27,110
That's great!

154
00:11:28,560 --> 00:11:32,430
Next is a taxi driver.

155
00:11:34,470 --> 00:11:37,810
He got 14 pesos in.

156
00:11:38,770 --> 00:11:40,830
This guy found a good way to stick his money in.

157
00:11:41,380 --> 00:11:44,030
Wow, you're doing a good job!

158
00:11:48,130 --> 00:11:54,190
He stuck 16 pesos in his nose.

159
00:11:55,440 --> 00:11:59,640
This unemployed guy tried his luck.

160
00:12:08,100 --> 00:12:11,160
Hey, don't stick it in so far that you cry, idiot!

161
00:12:18,960 --> 00:12:24,470
17, 18, 19, 20, 21! Good job!

162
00:12:29,470 --> 00:12:33,630
Chief, great job with this! You have a lot of customers, too!

163
00:12:33,630 --> 00:12:39,230
Yeah, the other guys just take all my money and go home.

164
00:12:39,230 --> 00:12:43,090
I have to think of a different system or something.

165
00:12:44,040 --> 00:12:51,350
So with this unique event, that's all from me, Roberto Gabishan!

166
00:12:53,100 --> 00:12:55,100
Thanks, Gabishan!

167
00:12:55,100 --> 00:12:57,200
It was a great idea, Ghorchyan!

168
00:12:57,200 --> 00:13:02,760
You know, America thought that the philippines will come up with some crazy shit, and they totally did!

169
00:13:03,010 --> 00:13:04,860
Got it. How about you, Natalia?

170
00:13:05,160 --> 00:13:07,040
Well, I totally disagree.

171
00:13:07,040 --> 00:13:08,500
Instead of noses, I see eyes!

172
00:13:08,500 --> 00:13:11,770
The eyes of the Philippinos are energetic and strong!

173
00:13:11,770 --> 00:13:13,320
Excellent!

174
00:13:13,870 --> 00:13:16,370
How about you, Hamata?

175
00:13:14,820 --> 00:13:16,370
It's "Hamada."

176
00:13:16,370 --> 00:13:19,320
No matter what Ghorchyan says, you always say "I disagree," right?

177
00:13:19,320 --> 00:13:20,360
She always disagrees.

178
00:13:22,830 --> 00:13:24,330
She won't say anything back.

179
00:13:24,330 --> 00:13:26,980
What's this? Wait a moment!

180
00:13:26,980 --> 00:13:28,480
Hey Ghorchyan...

181
00:13:28,480 --> 00:13:31,340
you totally look like Nicholas Cage, huh?

182
00:13:31,790 --> 00:13:33,590
I'm so embarassed!

183
00:13:33,590 --> 00:13:35,090
Ha ha ha ha!

184
00:13:38,140 --> 00:13:40,600
This is pissing me off.

185
00:13:44,050 --> 00:13:45,450
Hamata, what do you think?

186
00:13:45,450 --> 00:13:47,700
Do people ever say you resemble someone?

187
00:13:47,700 --> 00:13:49,350
Well- It's "Hamada."

188
00:13:49,350 --> 00:13:52,890
And no one has said that, but that video...

189
00:13:53,310 --> 00:13:55,810
Matsumoto looks like Ken Watanabe though, right?

190
00:14:00,510 --> 00:14:03,320
You don't give a shit about my comment.

191
00:14:05,720 --> 00:14:09,320
Japanese Gay-nin really are number one!

192
00:14:09,920 --> 00:14:11,180
Excellent! Excellent! Exceleeent!

193
00:14:11,180 --> 00:14:12,480
Excellent! Excellent! Exceleeent!

194
00:14:12,480 --> 00:14:13,930
Excellent! Excellent! Exceleeent!

195
00:14:13,930 --> 00:14:15,750
Listen to what Matsumoto has to say, dumbass!

196
00:14:17,630 --> 00:14:19,800
Matsumoto!

197
00:14:19,800 --> 00:14:20,940
Matsumoto...

198
00:14:20,940 --> 00:14:23,090
What did you think of the video?

199
00:14:23,090 --> 00:14:26,890
How much is one Peso anyway?

200
00:14:26,890 --> 00:14:29,190
We can't really judge how much they made.

201
00:14:29,790 --> 00:14:31,700
One Peso is two Yen.

202
00:14:31,700 --> 00:14:33,000
Two yen?

203
00:14:31,700 --> 00:14:33,000
Two yen?

204
00:14:33,000 --> 00:14:37,100
Well, I guess even though they tried so hard, they earned very little, huh?

205
00:14:37,100 --> 00:14:38,240
It's tough for them.

206
00:14:38,240 --> 00:14:40,260
But, it's free money.

207
00:14:43,310 --> 00:14:47,480
Well yeah, but even though it's money,

208
00:14:47,480 --> 00:14:50,970
it's not enough to buy anything!

209
00:14:51,320 --> 00:14:53,350
Well, even if they can't buy anything,

210
00:14:53,350 --> 00:14:56,520
the communication between them all is important, right?

211
00:14:57,120 --> 00:15:00,180
Why the hell did you get so serious all of a sudden?

212
00:15:05,780 --> 00:15:07,970
I don't get it!

213
00:15:07,970 --> 00:15:09,970
That's not funny at all!

214
00:15:11,940 --> 00:15:14,790
They're fucked up!

215
00:15:14,790 --> 00:15:17,440
Hold on...

216
00:15:19,340 --> 00:15:20,700
Excuse me!

217
00:15:20,700 --> 00:15:22,250
Matsumoto, please continue.

218
00:15:22,200 --> 00:15:23,850
But I'm already done.

219
00:15:27,100 --> 00:15:27,750
Okay.

220
00:15:27,750 --> 00:15:28,540
Hey!

221
00:15:30,710 --> 00:15:32,410
Not this again!

222
00:15:31,210 --> 00:15:32,410
What the hell?

223
00:15:32,410 --> 00:15:34,410
It's going to be so lame!

224
00:15:40,370 --> 00:15:44,070
Show us your Gay-nin spirit, Matsumoto!

225
00:15:45,220 --> 00:15:47,220
Wow, this is so lame.

226
00:15:47,770 --> 00:15:50,430
Seriously leave me out of this.

227
00:15:50,430 --> 00:15:53,130
It's no different from the people in the video.

228
00:15:53,530 --> 00:15:55,330
How is he gonna stuff those in?

229
00:15:55,330 --> 00:15:56,870
Ow ow ow ow ow ow!

230
00:16:01,940 --> 00:16:04,340
Matsumoto, you can really stuff it in!

231
00:16:06,300 --> 00:16:08,390
Matsumoto, you really have some guts!

232
00:16:19,300 --> 00:16:21,390
Ahh, Matsumoto...

233
00:16:21,390 --> 00:16:22,810
We're just playing around.

234
00:16:22,810 --> 00:16:25,460
Japanese Gay-nin really are hard workers!

235
00:16:29,860 --> 00:16:31,320
What the hell?

236
00:16:34,170 --> 00:16:37,520
It's good you did it, though.

237
00:16:34,820 --> 00:16:37,520
You totally got him to do it!

238
00:16:37,520 --> 00:16:40,980
Seriously Giles, you're the best!

239
00:16:40,980 --> 00:16:42,280
The best!

240
00:16:43,030 --> 00:16:45,960
OK, that's everything. I'm Giles Besson.

241
00:16:45,960 --> 00:16:47,750
See you next week! Bye bye.

242
00:16:53,290 --> 00:16:57,440
Hamata, Matsumoto, you guys did a great job!

243
00:16:57,440 --> 00:16:59,440
Really great.

244
00:17:01,150 --> 00:17:03,150
He's a great sidekick.

245
00:17:05,450 --> 00:17:08,300
Yeah, just like "Last Samurai."

246
00:17:08,300 --> 00:17:10,110
Yeah, cause you don't look like a ninja.

247
00:17:12,110 --> 00:17:14,010
Gay-nin Gay-nin!
