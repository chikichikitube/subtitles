00:00:02,490 --> 00:00:06,190
Welcome to Wednesday Downtown,

2
00:00:07,820 --> 00:00:09,980
Let's get on with our first presenter please

3
00:00:15,160 --> 00:00:18,530
It's Jinnai Tomonori

4
00:00:20,030 --> 00:00:21,230
Soh, the project I brought is...

5
00:00:21,230 --> 00:00:22,730
"Soh"?

6
00:00:23,740 --> 00:00:25,900
Not so, but soh?

7
00:00:25,900 --> 00:00:27,310
So

8
00:00:27,310 --> 00:00:30,640
Let's get to this, this time the theory I bring you is this

9
00:00:31,560 --> 00:00:37,620
6th No matter who views these comedians' funniest moments, they'll find them interesting

10
00:00:37,620 --> 00:00:38,850
This is it

11
00:00:38,850 --> 00:00:40,150
This is the 6th edition

12
00:00:40,150 --> 00:00:42,990
Yes, the 6th edition so it has become a regular project

13
00:00:42,990 --> 00:00:43,790
What do you think about this, Matsumoto?

14
00:00:43,790 --> 00:00:47,080
I'm sure there will be many editions of this

15
00:00:47,080 --> 00:00:50,360
Since its focusing on old footage

16
00:00:50,360 --> 00:00:52,330
It doesn't cost anything at all

17
00:00:52,330 --> 00:00:53,600
Just spending a little

18
00:00:54,820 --> 00:00:56,100
How much?

19
00:01:11,760 --> 00:01:19,720
6th No matter who views these comedians' funniest moments, they'll find them interesting

20
00:01:20,370 --> 00:01:26,730
First of all, Oda

21
00:01:27,170 --> 00:01:30,840
This one is more than 20 years old

22
00:01:30,840 --> 00:01:35,970
But I still get a great feeling when watching it

23
00:01:35,970 --> 00:01:41,640
Higashino's project of wrestling with idols

24
00:01:41,000 --> 00:01:42,500
Carrie

25
00:01:41,810 --> 00:01:44,680
Throwing female idols around, kicking them

26
00:01:44,680 --> 00:01:48,180
It's pretty tough to do

27
00:01:48,290 --> 00:01:54,990
At one point, Higashino, who had unilaterally suppressed the idol, was attacked

28
00:01:55,090 --> 00:01:59,400
The referee was Hamada, who was fanning the flames

29
00:01:59,400 --> 00:02:03,570
He incited the idol to get fired up

30
00:02:03,570 --> 00:02:06,670
As a result, Higashino was beaten

31
00:02:06,850 --> 00:02:10,610
Lets see his reaction

32
00:02:10,780 --> 00:02:13,040
This is not the kind of response you can make when asked to

33
00:02:13,040 --> 00:02:17,650
Its a one-time miraculous reaction

34
00:02:17,060 --> 00:02:18,950
What?

35
00:02:17,650 --> 00:02:22,650
This is Idol vs. Higashino: The shocking ending

36
00:02:22,650 --> 00:02:24,450
So nostalgic

37
00:02:24,450 --> 00:02:26,110
That's right, this one

38
00:02:26,110 --> 00:02:28,610
This idol is very strong

39
00:02:28,530 --> 00:02:30,330
Starting from here

40
00:02:30,330 --> 00:02:32,330
Strangled

41
00:02:32,330 --> 00:02:33,610
Yes, it starts here

42
00:02:37,320 --> 00:02:38,470
Awesome

43
00:02:38,470 --> 00:02:39,820
I remember

44
00:02:39,820 --> 00:02:41,360
Throwing up!

45
00:02:40,650 --> 00:02:42,840
This

46
00:02:42,840 --> 00:02:44,710
This expression and...

47
00:02:45,180 --> 00:02:47,750
I couldn't believe my eyes...

48
00:02:47,750 --> 00:02:49,950
Not sure its a performance, rewind and watch it again

49
00:02:49,950 --> 00:02:50,980
Really throwing up

50
00:02:51,250 --> 00:02:52,520
I can't get over it

51
00:02:52,710 --> 00:02:55,220
Watching this as a student left me with a strong impression

52
00:02:55,550 --> 00:03:01,950
Oda's funniest moment: Higashino throwing up

53
00:03:03,400 --> 00:03:05,560
And kicked down into it

54
00:03:05,560 --> 00:03:07,970
Kicked into his own vomit

55
00:03:08,500 --> 00:03:13,900
Next is Knights' Hanagawa

56
00:03:15,540 --> 00:03:19,910
Senba Kitcho's press conference, which caused an uproar more than 10 years ago

57
00:03:20,050 --> 00:03:27,850
The boss's pauses, intonation, timing and facial expressions

58
00:03:25,500 --> 00:03:29,080
There are also serious ones

59
00:03:27,850 --> 00:03:30,030
It's all textbook

60
00:03:30,030 --> 00:03:33,230
His most interesting moment is from 10 years ago

61
00:03:33,230 --> 00:03:41,860
A press conference for Senba Kitcho, a high-class restaurant that became a sensation in 2007 because of the food falsification issue

62
00:03:37,410 --> 00:03:39,730
It's like a skit

63
00:03:41,860 --> 00:03:49,070
When answering a reporter's question, the owner's wife whispered instructions to the son who answered the questions

64
00:03:49,070 --> 00:03:52,480
Known as the whispering boss lady

65
00:03:49,530 --> 00:03:51,210
So this is it!

66
00:03:51,210 --> 00:03:52,690
You don't know it?

67
00:03:52,710 --> 00:03:57,710
Its difficult to perfect pauses like this in skits

68
00:03:57,710 --> 00:04:00,450
Especially for current affairs manzai

69
00:04:00,690 --> 00:04:03,660
There will be times when I can't write

70
00:04:03,660 --> 00:04:09,230
And when reading again, i'm forced to go back and reflect

71
00:04:09,230 --> 00:04:12,900
Its kind of like musicians going back to listen to The Beatles

72
00:04:12,900 --> 00:04:16,000
If you can't decide, go back to Senba Kitcho to reflect

73
00:04:16,580 --> 00:04:21,010
A textbook example, this press conference

74
00:04:21,010 --> 00:04:27,410
So, what was the reason for the change in the labeling?

75
00:04:27,410 --> 00:04:28,930
That...

76
00:04:28,930 --> 00:04:30,380
Louder

77
00:04:30,780 --> 00:04:32,520
Looking into each other's eyes

78
00:04:32,520 --> 00:04:40,460
We had a weak awareness of compliance

79
00:04:40,530 --> 00:04:42,590
The shot is also interesting

80
00:04:42,590 --> 00:04:46,330
That is, there is no subjective sense of trying to deceive consumers, right?

81
00:04:44,700 --> 00:04:49,400
No

82
00:04:53,310 --> 00:04:56,710
Say "we didn't think"

83
00:04:59,970 --> 00:05:03,580
Thought people couldn't hear

84
00:05:04,680 --> 00:05:07,610
We didn't think

85
00:05:06,010 --> 00:05:09,320
He said it

86
00:05:07,990 --> 00:05:14,530
And made a statement
to avoid responsibility

87
00:05:12,090 --> 00:05:13,860
Too funny

88
00:05:14,650 --> 00:05:16,950
The cameraman is hesitating

89
00:05:16,930 --> 00:05:21,560
We didn't know what we were talking about

90
00:05:16,960 --> 00:05:19,580
This must be a first

91
00:05:22,170 --> 00:05:25,140
I'm really sorry

92
00:05:25,500 --> 00:05:28,310
It's interesting no matter how many times I watch it

93
00:05:28,410 --> 00:05:34,750
And with the mother-son relationship, it's even better...

94
00:05:34,750 --> 00:05:36,950
It's probably always like this with them

95
00:05:36,950 --> 00:05:41,280
Telling the child "don't do this"

96
00:05:41,280 --> 00:05:44,490
It reveals some of the normality of mother-son relationships

97
00:05:44,490 --> 00:05:48,130
The son would normally say "enough"

98
00:05:48,130 --> 00:05:51,460
But couldn't say it because he's at a press conference

99
00:05:51,460 --> 00:05:55,130
Plus the son's expressions make it all the more interesting

100
00:05:55,130 --> 00:06:00,370
By the way, the Senba Kitcho name has now been abandoned

101
00:06:00,930 --> 00:06:05,540
Instead, they have opened a store called "Yuki" in Kitashinchi

102
00:06:06,340 --> 00:06:09,600
Apparently, the boss's wife occasionally appears in the restaurant

103
00:06:09,600 --> 00:06:11,760
If you go there, you may meet her

104
00:06:12,560 --> 00:06:18,770
Next is Mouchu Gakusei

105
00:06:18,960 --> 00:06:23,080
A few years ago, I happened to see it on TV

106
00:06:23,080 --> 00:06:27,770
The ranking of Yoshimoto artists

107
00:06:27,890 --> 00:06:32,240
A program like "Personal Information Disclosure Yoshimoto Ranking

108
00:06:32,240 --> 00:06:36,170
It was a live show

109
00:06:36,170 --> 00:06:40,550
Diane's Tsuda was very impressive

110
00:06:40,680 --> 00:06:44,950
It was revealed that the staff said a lot of bad things about Tsuda

111
00:06:45,280 --> 00:06:47,050
Lots of examples

112
00:06:47,050 --> 00:06:51,960
Tsuda's response was very impressive

113
00:06:51,960 --> 00:06:54,590
His rebuke was really powerful

114
00:06:54,590 --> 00:06:55,690
So much so that I couldn't go to sleep afterwards

115
00:06:55,690 --> 00:07:00,130
It was just replaying in my mind over and over

116
00:07:00,960 --> 00:07:05,140
Here is Tsuda's rebuke

117
00:07:06,270 --> 00:07:08,610
Photography assistant in her 20s

118
00:07:08,610 --> 00:07:12,040
As usual, he didn't talk at all during a food location shoot

119
00:07:12,040 --> 00:07:15,780
But he was super loud when eating pasta

120
00:07:15,780 --> 00:07:17,480
Don't say "as usual"!

121
00:07:17,480 --> 00:07:21,120
Oi! Assistant photographer, don't say "as usual"!

122
00:07:21,120 --> 00:07:22,190
"As usual!"

123
00:07:22,190 --> 00:07:25,020
I think this reaction is really strong

124
00:07:25,020 --> 00:07:26,160
"As usual"!

125
00:07:26,160 --> 00:07:28,830
He also ate a lot of bread

126
00:07:28,830 --> 00:07:31,630
What's wrong with that?

127
00:07:31,630 --> 00:07:34,130
What's wrong with that?

128
00:07:34,130 --> 00:07:36,730
What's wrong with eating bread?

129
00:07:38,570 --> 00:07:41,210
Why can't you eat bread?

130
00:07:41,210 --> 00:07:44,740
Eating bread is a good thing, right?

131
00:07:45,340 --> 00:07:49,350
Eating bread is a good thing!

132
00:07:50,220 --> 00:07:53,220
Eating bread is good, what the hell!?

133
00:07:53,220 --> 00:07:54,190
He's given reasons

134
00:07:54,190 --> 00:07:55,690
You ate a lot

135
00:07:55,690 --> 00:07:57,160
What's wrong with that?

136
00:07:58,360 --> 00:08:01,790
Did I eat it all? Eat the whole store?

137
00:08:01,990 --> 00:08:06,330
Ah, I still remember it very well

138
00:08:06,330 --> 00:08:09,430
I especially remember it when i'm ill

139
00:08:09,430 --> 00:08:10,940
It helps me recover

140
00:08:11,040 --> 00:08:15,110
The legendary line "What's wrong with eating bread?"

141
00:08:15,270 --> 00:08:17,480
I probably won't be able to sleep tonight either

142
00:08:17,480 --> 00:08:21,350
Its stamped to the inside of my eyelids

143
00:08:21,960 --> 00:08:25,540
The moment that Mouchu Gakusei likes the most

144
00:08:25,540 --> 00:08:29,350
Tsuda's bread-related criticism

145
00:08:29,350 --> 00:08:31,920
What's wrong with eating bread?

146
00:08:32,390 --> 00:08:38,290
Next is Kawahara

147
00:08:38,290 --> 00:08:39,940
His choice must be weird

148
00:08:38,930 --> 00:08:41,700
Utsunomiya's new comedy

149
00:08:41,700 --> 00:08:43,270
Although a junior

150
00:08:41,870 --> 00:08:43,730
The name is wrong

151
00:08:43,270 --> 00:08:45,540
On Instagram or something

152
00:08:45,740 --> 00:08:47,670
She did something

153
00:08:47,670 --> 00:08:51,280
Made something

154
00:08:51,480 --> 00:08:55,740
It was really interesting

155
00:08:55,740 --> 00:08:58,220
Or maybe infuriating

156
00:08:58,220 --> 00:09:00,110
Irritatingly funny

157
00:08:59,620 --> 00:09:01,020
What do you mean?

158
00:09:00,610 --> 00:09:04,850
The video of Utsunomiya

159
00:09:06,060 --> 00:09:07,220
What is this

160
00:09:08,130 --> 00:09:10,700
This is it

161
00:09:10,060 --> 00:09:11,380
What the hell?

162
00:09:13,230 --> 00:09:17,000
What's she spending a long time doing?

163
00:09:18,920 --> 00:09:20,200
What is it?

164
00:09:20,200 --> 00:09:21,480
I see

165
00:09:26,410 --> 00:09:28,150
It fits in

166
00:09:38,220 --> 00:09:41,430
It's really interesting

167
00:09:41,430 --> 00:09:43,490
Awesome

168
00:09:42,040 --> 00:09:43,490
So surreal

169
00:09:43,490 --> 00:09:45,490
Because it's Kawahara!

170
00:09:43,660 --> 00:09:48,030
The excitement of not knowing what's happening

171
00:09:48,030 --> 00:09:52,200
Then she put in a mushroom

172
00:09:52,200 --> 00:09:56,310
This point is pretty common

173
00:09:56,160 --> 00:09:58,160
Not very common

174
00:09:56,810 --> 00:10:00,410
Everyone would put in a mushroom in

175
00:10:00,650 --> 00:10:04,450
But after that...

176
00:10:04,450 --> 00:10:07,920
She looks at the camera

177
00:10:09,120 --> 00:10:11,660
The last laugh

178
00:10:11,860 --> 00:10:14,660
I don't understand the feelings

179
00:10:14,660 --> 00:10:19,000
Wondering about the emotions is interesting

180
00:10:19,000 --> 00:10:23,570
Putting mushrooms in is something that probably everyone has done

181
00:10:23,640 --> 00:10:25,200
Did you see it?

182
00:10:25,200 --> 00:10:27,430
Hama-chan...Hama-chan, did you see it?

183
00:10:26,560 --> 00:10:29,430
Don't say Hama-chan

184
00:10:27,610 --> 00:10:28,540
Did you see it, Hama-chan?

185
00:10:28,540 --> 00:10:30,810
Then watch 1 more time... please play it 1 more time

186
00:10:30,060 --> 00:10:31,400
He saw it!

187
00:10:30,810 --> 00:10:36,010
Hosting is a big headache

188
00:10:36,380 --> 00:10:41,820
Next is Minamikawa

189
00:10:43,190 --> 00:10:47,930
Two years ago, Shochiku had a 1 minute video

190
00:10:47,930 --> 00:10:51,660
It came from a competition which was voted on

191
00:10:51,760 --> 00:10:53,800
Because it is something that can be done at home

192
00:10:53,800 --> 00:10:55,170
And because they were all comedians

193
00:10:55,170 --> 00:10:59,340
They involved parody skits

194
00:10:59,700 --> 00:11:02,940
But among them was Iwami

195
00:11:02,940 --> 00:11:05,180
She is a 48 year old entertainer

196
00:11:05,180 --> 00:11:09,450
This senpai did something that made people wonder, "Hey, why did you do this?

197
00:11:09,680 --> 00:11:13,750
With the words  "Residential Area Stairway Challenge", it begins

198
00:11:13,990 --> 00:11:20,390
They couldn't leave their building

199
00:11:20,390 --> 00:11:24,800
So, this 48-year-old woman

200
00:11:24,800 --> 00:11:30,440
She went from the 4th floor down to the 1st floor of her building

201
00:11:30,440 --> 00:11:34,910
She did a challenge to get down the stairs in 40 seconds

202
00:11:34,910 --> 00:11:38,910
For what? Who would do this?

203
00:11:38,910 --> 00:11:40,680
The reasons for this are unknown

204
00:11:41,310 --> 00:11:44,420
Why would you shoot this?

205
00:11:45,080 --> 00:11:46,650
You can't even hear what's being said

206
00:11:46,880 --> 00:11:49,390
The image is also very confusing

207
00:11:49,390 --> 00:11:53,460
As a comedia with 20 years of experience

208
00:11:53,460 --> 00:11:58,300
Its a bit of a clumsy performance

209
00:11:58,300 --> 00:12:01,300
It would be interesting to include all of them

210
00:12:01,470 --> 00:12:07,410
This was played on my web show

211
00:12:07,410 --> 00:12:10,370
Really for only hardcore comedy fans

212
00:12:10,370 --> 00:12:13,580
And it created a small-scale sensation

213
00:12:14,010 --> 00:12:18,580
The "Residential Area Stairway Challenge" begins

214
00:12:18,680 --> 00:12:21,240
Hello, I'm Iwami, and I'm here for the project "Kakuza at Home"

215
00:12:18,680 --> 00:12:21,240
※Kakuza is a theater located in Dotonbori, Osaka.

216
00:12:21,240 --> 00:12:24,020
I'm going to do the "Residential Area Stairway Challenge"

217
00:12:22,410 --> 00:12:24,020
Nice piano

218
00:12:24,020 --> 00:12:25,660
I am now on the 4th floor

219
00:12:25,660 --> 00:12:28,190
The light is still flickering after being replaced

220
00:12:26,890 --> 00:12:29,510
Why?

221
00:12:28,190 --> 00:12:32,600
I want to go down the stairs from the 4th floor to the 1st floor in 40 seconds

222
00:12:29,510 --> 00:12:31,110
Fix it!

223
00:12:32,600 --> 00:12:34,700
The biggest challenge is on the 2nd floor

224
00:12:34,700 --> 00:12:37,340
Because a man on the 2nd floor has left his door open

225
00:12:36,440 --> 00:12:38,000
Can't hear it at all

226
00:12:37,340 --> 00:12:39,240
I have to get through there fast

227
00:12:39,240 --> 00:12:42,810
So, the "Residential Area Stairway Challenge" begins!

228
00:12:46,820 --> 00:12:49,500
The middle-aged woman is going down the stairs

229
00:12:49,500 --> 00:12:51,200
Causing trouble

230
00:12:51,160 --> 00:12:52,390
What kind of challenge is this?

231
00:12:53,180 --> 00:12:55,370
Ah, the door is open

232
00:13:01,360 --> 00:13:04,460
Did it. Easy pass

233
00:13:04,460 --> 00:13:08,230
The "Residential Area Stairway Challenge" was a success!

234
00:13:09,070 --> 00:13:12,240
It's so confusing...

235
00:13:12,240 --> 00:13:14,810
No matter how many times I look at it its still good

236
00:13:13,880 --> 00:13:15,480
The meaning is indeed unclear

237
00:13:14,810 --> 00:13:18,940
At the start, the light is flickering

238
00:13:18,940 --> 00:13:20,440
So why shoot there?

239
00:13:20,440 --> 00:13:25,320
Wouldn't starting from the door be better?

240
00:13:25,320 --> 00:13:28,600
Why start by wearing shoes?

241
00:13:28,200 --> 00:13:29,360
Having a good laugh

242
00:13:28,590 --> 00:13:31,860
There's a door open on the 2nd floor?

243
00:13:31,860 --> 00:13:33,620
That doesn't really matter

244
00:13:35,990 --> 00:13:39,630
Why not find out why its open afterwards

245
00:13:39,630 --> 00:13:45,600
The guy who lives there said "electromagnetic waves can't be dissipated" so he kept the door open

246
00:13:45,870 --> 00:13:48,650
So many points

247
00:13:48,650 --> 00:13:49,670
Then Iwami

248
00:13:49,770 --> 00:13:55,310
Lived there for 40 years, been downstairs every day for 40 years...

249
00:13:53,680 --> 00:13:56,880
It's so long, this commentary

250
00:13:55,310 --> 00:13:59,520
5 seconds to get down the stairs in elementary school

251
00:13:58,110 --> 00:13:59,520
What are you laughing at?

252
00:14:00,220 --> 00:14:04,790
"When I was in elementary school, I could get down the stairs in 5 seconds by centrifugal force"

253
00:14:03,760 --> 00:14:05,240
So much to say!

254
00:14:05,240 --> 00:14:08,680
Minamikawa's favorite moment

255
00:14:08,680 --> 00:14:13,080
Combining multiple factors in a residential area down stairs challenge

256
00:14:15,540 --> 00:14:17,700
Watching it again

257
00:14:19,520 --> 00:14:22,140
The full version again

258
00:14:21,450 --> 00:14:24,610
Did it. Easy pass

259
00:14:24,610 --> 00:14:27,720
The "Residential Area Stairway Challenge" was a success!

260
00:14:29,400 --> 00:14:31,380
Okay, that's it

261
00:14:31,380 --> 00:14:36,850
Impressive, didn't even say how long it took her

262
00:14:36,850 --> 00:14:40,060
The results were not revealed
-It only would've taken a few seconds

263
00:14:40,060 --> 00:14:42,630
It might've been longer

264
00:14:42,630 --> 00:14:44,130
What do you think, Meruru?

265
00:14:44,130 --> 00:14:46,830
So that's where "whispering boss lady" came from

266
00:14:46,830 --> 00:14:49,200
I've heard people say it, but I didn't know what it referred to

267
00:14:49,200 --> 00:14:52,660
I always thought it was a folktale

268
00:14:52,660 --> 00:14:56,430
So it really happened!

269
00:14:58,280 --> 00:14:59,870
Speaking of Tsuda

270
00:14:59,870 --> 00:15:04,300
On Owarai no Hino

271
00:15:04,300 --> 00:15:06,450
That part I really liked...

272
00:15:06,450 --> 00:15:08,130
"Goigoisu"

273
00:15:11,550 --> 00:15:13,620
Super funny
-It's really funny

274
00:15:37,790 --> 00:15:39,340
What?

275
00:15:46,260 --> 00:15:48,690
Actually, it's not funny at all

276
00:15:48,690 --> 00:15:49,790
On the contrary

277
00:15:51,680 --> 00:15:54,700
Let's welcome the next presenter

278
00:15:59,580 --> 00:16:03,170
It's Fujwara!

279
00:16:05,680 --> 00:16:06,900
Enough

280
00:16:06,900 --> 00:16:11,730
Next is not a theory but instead a project we've all been waiting for

281
00:16:12,860 --> 00:16:14,630
MONSTER LOVE

282
00:16:16,320 --> 00:16:17,820
Looking forward to it

283
00:16:17,820 --> 00:16:22,660
This time, it's the 4th installment of Kuro's love project

284
00:16:22,660 --> 00:16:25,510
I really like this project.
-Really?

285
00:16:25,510 --> 00:16:29,820
I watched it beforehand and watched each part twice

286
00:16:29,820 --> 00:16:33,000
I love it so much, its so good

287
00:16:33,000 --> 00:16:36,010
But what do women think of this project?

288
00:16:36,010 --> 00:16:38,180
What do you think, Meruru

289
00:16:38,180 --> 00:16:39,980
I also watched it

290
00:16:39,980 --> 00:16:41,680
I told everyone I "watched it for work reasons"

291
00:16:41,680 --> 00:16:43,310
Don't want others to think it's what I want to see

292
00:16:43,310 --> 00:16:44,620
No, it's not

293
00:16:44,620 --> 00:16:46,120
I felt ashamed

294
00:16:46,120 --> 00:16:47,590
It's okay to watch for non-work reasons

295
00:16:47,590 --> 00:16:49,290
Its necessary to watch in advance

296
00:16:49,290 --> 00:16:51,860
So, here's what's happened so far

297
00:16:51,860 --> 00:16:58,040
Kuro-chan and the women recruited by the program who like Kuro-chan started living together in Okinawa

298
00:16:58,040 --> 00:17:02,460
Among them are people just pretending to like Kuro-chan

299
00:17:02,460 --> 00:17:08,150
Last time, Kuro-chan mistook Risa, who really liked him, for a pretender and eliminated her

300
00:17:08,150 --> 00:17:10,820
Yes.
-What a shame

301
00:17:11,650 --> 00:17:12,820
You are really...

302
00:17:15,540 --> 00:17:18,340
That scene was really great

303
00:17:18,340 --> 00:17:20,320
A great scene

304
00:17:20,320 --> 00:17:22,490
Then after the elimination

305
00:17:22,490 --> 00:17:31,620
Richi kissed Kuro-chan after discussing whether his mouths stink or not
-A great scene

306
00:17:31,620 --> 00:17:35,260
That part when they were talking about if his mouth stinks
-Back and forth

307
00:17:35,260 --> 00:17:38,000
The psychological warfare of breath holding

308
00:17:38,000 --> 00:17:39,460
What?

309
00:17:41,010 --> 00:17:44,940
It's a psychological war of smell

310
00:17:44,940 --> 00:17:48,420
I was in the dressing room of TBS once

311
00:17:48,420 --> 00:17:50,250
There were several female make-up artists around

312
00:17:50,250 --> 00:17:53,280
Everyone's hands stopped moving

313
00:17:53,280 --> 00:17:54,620
So it'll stop

314
00:17:54,620 --> 00:17:57,770
So a lot of people must be happy to see this

315
00:18:15,690 --> 00:18:16,650
What?

316
00:18:17,290 --> 00:18:19,200
CPAP
-Treatment of apnea

317
00:18:21,010 --> 00:18:22,840
Who?

318
00:18:26,040 --> 00:18:27,780
It's a good thing she didn't laugh out loud

319
00:18:27,780 --> 00:18:29,420
Indeed

320
00:18:29,850 --> 00:18:31,920
Aki-kun

321
00:18:33,220 --> 00:18:35,260
Wake up~
-Miku

322
00:18:36,260 --> 00:18:37,830
Good morning

323
00:18:38,030 --> 00:18:39,900
Darth Vader!

324
00:18:42,130 --> 00:18:45,040
What's going on?

325
00:18:45,770 --> 00:18:49,540
This is CPAP, because of apnea

326
00:18:45,770 --> 00:18:49,540
※Continuous positive airway pressure ventilation system

327
00:18:49,540 --> 00:18:50,640
Oh I see

328
00:18:50,810 --> 00:18:51,980
Not "Oh I see"

329
00:18:52,140 --> 00:18:53,480
There are other things you should ask, right?

330
00:18:55,400 --> 00:18:56,280
Oh I see

331
00:18:56,680 --> 00:19:00,480
I've made breakfast. Want to join me?

332
00:19:00,480 --> 00:19:01,220
Of course

333
00:19:01,620 --> 00:19:03,950
Then I'll wait for you in the dining room

334
00:19:03,950 --> 00:19:05,390
Ok

335
00:19:06,180 --> 00:19:08,320
Seems like an act

336
00:19:10,430 --> 00:19:13,730
I'm in a good mood this morning

337
00:19:14,020 --> 00:19:15,610
An angry expression

338
00:19:15,610 --> 00:19:17,020
Just the two of them

339
00:19:16,530 --> 00:19:18,700
Looks delicious!

340
00:19:18,700 --> 00:19:19,370
Great!

341
00:19:19,740 --> 00:19:21,770
You went to culinary school?

342
00:19:22,080 --> 00:19:24,680
Yes, I trained as a pastry chef

343
00:19:24,680 --> 00:19:30,220
So I've been trying to get Kuro-chan to eat freshly made food

344
00:19:30,580 --> 00:19:33,990
Thought I'd bake some cookies if I had time today

345
00:19:34,250 --> 00:19:35,620
Will you eat them if I do?

346
00:19:36,120 --> 00:19:37,320
Absolutely.
-Really?

347
00:19:37,990 --> 00:19:39,460
Then I'll make more

348
00:19:39,920 --> 00:19:41,520
I'm gonna get fat

349
00:19:40,920 --> 00:19:42,340
You're fat enough already

350
00:19:42,460 --> 00:19:49,040
Can you accompany me to the place I want to go later today?

351
00:19:49,040 --> 00:19:52,780
There is a place I've always wanted to go with you, just the two of us

352
00:19:53,570 --> 00:19:55,470
You've become so aggressive

353
00:19:57,210 --> 00:19:58,340
So embarrassing

354
00:19:57,930 --> 00:19:59,120
What's wrong with this guy?

355
00:19:58,810 --> 00:20:00,450
Good morning

356
00:19:59,120 --> 00:20:00,880
Handsome man's lines

357
00:20:00,440 --> 00:20:02,980
It's early

358
00:20:03,370 --> 00:20:05,980
Thank you for the food

359
00:20:05,980 --> 00:20:07,620
I'll go first

360
00:20:09,160 --> 00:20:10,600
The atmosphere is a bit weird

361
00:20:09,720 --> 00:20:12,020
Where are you going?

362
00:20:12,150 --> 00:20:13,690
They'd surely ask

363
00:20:13,120 --> 00:20:15,420
Miku has somewhere she wants to go

364
00:20:15,960 --> 00:20:17,960
Yes
-I'll leave you to it

365
00:20:17,520 --> 00:20:18,920
The atmosphere is tense!

366
00:20:18,920 --> 00:20:20,000
Bye-bye

367
00:20:20,000 --> 00:20:21,650
See you later

368
00:20:21,650 --> 00:20:22,400
I'll go first

369
00:20:22,410 --> 00:20:24,090
Obvious expressions

370
00:20:24,240 --> 00:20:25,110
A date?

371
00:20:25,110 --> 00:20:26,570
It's a date, right?

372
00:20:26,940 --> 00:20:31,280
So uncomfortable. She's so aggressive

373
00:20:32,930 --> 00:20:35,280
I told you, we don't need this

374
00:20:36,850 --> 00:20:37,940
Its needed!

375
00:20:39,040 --> 00:20:42,690
Ah its starting

376
00:20:42,690 --> 00:20:43,780
That's enough!

377
00:20:47,850 --> 00:20:48,820
So cute

378
00:20:48,820 --> 00:20:50,300
Everyone is so cute

379
00:20:58,330 --> 00:20:59,660
Don't smell it. Don't smell it

380
00:21:03,280 --> 00:21:04,660
So trendy

381
00:21:12,350 --> 00:21:13,960
We're here?
-Here?

382
00:21:13,960 --> 00:21:15,310
Yes, here

383
00:21:15,650 --> 00:21:18,130
The place I've always wanted to come with Aki-kun

384
00:21:18,460 --> 00:21:19,780
You wanted to come here?
-Yes!

385
00:21:21,270 --> 00:21:23,490
Up here?
-Up here

386
00:21:24,330 --> 00:21:25,420
Glasses?

387
00:21:27,060 --> 00:21:28,950
Super beautiful!

388
00:21:28,950 --> 00:21:30,430
Super beautiful

389
00:21:30,430 --> 00:21:33,800
That's awesome!

390
00:21:33,970 --> 00:21:35,210
You wanted to come here, right?

391
00:21:35,440 --> 00:21:38,210
She said it already!

392
00:21:38,210 --> 00:21:41,150
I wanted to see this view with Aki-kun

393
00:21:41,980 --> 00:21:43,950
This bell

394
00:21:44,180 --> 00:21:48,690
It is said that if you ring it with your lover, you will be happy together

395
00:21:48,690 --> 00:21:50,790
So I want to do it with you

396
00:21:51,120 --> 00:21:55,770
"With your lover" means we're already lovers?

397
00:21:56,530 --> 00:21:58,460
Is it ok to be lovers?

398
00:22:00,000 --> 00:22:02,530
Well, lets do it together then

399
00:22:01,750 --> 00:22:03,050
Is that a yes, then?

400
00:22:03,050 --> 00:22:05,270
Didn't say yes, just said ring the bell

401
00:22:03,270 --> 00:22:05,240
Let's start 3 2 1

402
00:22:07,600 --> 00:22:08,710
It rang!

403
00:22:09,040 --> 00:22:10,270
It's ringing!

404
00:22:09,900 --> 00:22:12,100
No shit!
-It will definitely ring!

405
00:22:10,510 --> 00:22:12,510
It's ringing!

406
00:22:12,100 --> 00:22:14,550
You rang it!

407
00:22:13,310 --> 00:22:14,550
So happy

408
00:22:14,550 --> 00:22:17,180
I am also happy

409
00:22:17,550 --> 00:22:20,560
Ah, they sell local specialties.
-Oh, really?

410
00:22:18,790 --> 00:22:21,340
That was dangerous, just then

411
00:22:20,720 --> 00:22:22,020
And pendants

412
00:22:21,760 --> 00:22:24,400
Thought something was gonna happen

413
00:22:22,020 --> 00:22:23,450
They're heart-shaped

414
00:22:24,920 --> 00:22:26,160
Oh, really?

415
00:22:26,160 --> 00:22:27,000
So cute

416
00:22:27,160 --> 00:22:29,500
There are 2 in a box, shall we buy a pair?

417
00:22:29,690 --> 00:22:31,400
1 for 1?
-Yes

418
00:22:31,400 --> 00:22:32,530
Ok

419
00:22:32,530 --> 00:22:34,740
It's a beautiful day

420
00:22:34,740 --> 00:22:36,840
The sea can be seen so clearly

421
00:22:37,470 --> 00:22:38,270
Want to sit here?

422
00:22:38,270 --> 00:22:39,570
Yeah

423
00:22:41,440 --> 00:22:43,180
We've sat down.
-Yeah

424
00:22:43,180 --> 00:22:45,020
"We've sat down"

425
00:22:46,760 --> 00:22:49,180
The view in front is super beautiful!

426
00:22:49,180 --> 00:22:54,220
I wanted to have a good conversation in a place where I can relax

427
00:22:54,220 --> 00:22:57,450
I'm glad to finally have some time

428
00:22:57,450 --> 00:22:59,090
You stare at me like this

429
00:23:00,360 --> 00:23:03,060
It makes my heart burn

430
00:23:03,060 --> 00:23:05,460
It's burning?
-Yeah

431
00:23:03,180 --> 00:23:06,220
So powerful, such powerful words

432
00:23:06,900 --> 00:23:10,000
Can that burn my heart too?

433
00:23:10,670 --> 00:23:12,340
Ah, the other way around?

434
00:23:12,340 --> 00:23:15,010
I thought it was already burning~

435
00:23:15,010 --> 00:23:17,370
I want it to be a bit more intense

436
00:23:16,150 --> 00:23:20,370
If this was a performance you'd laugh out loud

437
00:23:20,410 --> 00:23:21,150
Feel it?

438
00:23:21,610 --> 00:23:22,680
Feel it?

439
00:23:23,220 --> 00:23:25,140
Impressive

440
00:23:23,280 --> 00:23:27,350
I've received a lot of Miku's love

441
00:23:28,020 --> 00:23:28,760
You got it?

442
00:23:28,760 --> 00:23:30,450
I got it

443
00:23:31,460 --> 00:23:35,630
But I can't just focus on Miku completely.
-Yeah

444
00:23:35,630 --> 00:23:37,660
If I only talk to Miku

445
00:23:37,660 --> 00:23:40,490
The others will start to be biased toward you

446
00:23:41,930 --> 00:23:45,600
Because I know that women's jealousy is very scary

447
00:23:44,840 --> 00:23:45,900
What do you know about it?

448
00:23:45,900 --> 00:23:47,790
It's like a big deal

449
00:23:47,270 --> 00:23:50,640
So although I like you a lot

450
00:23:50,640 --> 00:23:53,110
I can't be alone with you everyday

451
00:23:55,630 --> 00:23:59,720
Everyone is very nice, all very lovely

452
00:23:59,720 --> 00:24:04,890
And Aki-kun has to choose one

453
00:24:04,890 --> 00:24:06,800
It must be very difficult

454
00:24:09,290 --> 00:24:12,260
It's not easy!

455
00:24:12,520 --> 00:24:13,900
Such an angry expression

456
00:24:13,900 --> 00:24:16,930
Don't use that expression

457
00:24:16,930 --> 00:24:23,610
Because I am considering very sincerely, so it is very difficult

458
00:24:19,580 --> 00:24:21,450
Eh, are your eyes moist?

459
00:24:25,410 --> 00:24:28,690
It's hard to see Aki-kun feel bad, it makes me feel bad too

460
00:24:28,680 --> 00:24:31,550
I'm sorry, i'm very happy to be with you

461
00:24:28,690 --> 00:24:30,110
What are you talking about?

462
00:24:31,550 --> 00:24:32,250
I'm sorry. I'm sorry

463
00:24:32,250 --> 00:24:38,720
Well... I hope you can rely on me more

464
00:24:40,090 --> 00:24:42,490
His brain is messed up

465
00:24:41,430 --> 00:24:44,190
Give me a hug

466
00:24:44,190 --> 00:24:45,730
Come on

467
00:24:44,700 --> 00:24:47,780
Super aggressive

468
00:24:47,780 --> 00:24:52,780
For men, this isn't unbearable

469
00:24:57,050 --> 00:24:58,660
Where are you looking?

470
00:24:58,660 --> 00:25:02,280
Moist eyes looking to the distance

471
00:25:01,910 --> 00:25:04,450
I like you so much

472
00:25:04,450 --> 00:25:07,650
I like you most in the world

473
00:25:11,740 --> 00:25:13,580
That's not good

474
00:25:13,580 --> 00:25:17,670
Do not maintain this distance

475
00:25:17,630 --> 00:25:20,530
After that, you can pamper me

476
00:25:20,530 --> 00:25:22,000
Is that okay?
-Yes

477
00:25:22,000 --> 00:25:25,100
I'll pamper you, then

478
00:25:25,100 --> 00:25:26,700
I can be pampered at any time

479
00:25:27,240 --> 00:25:30,410
You are so gentle to me, despite there being no exclusivity...

480
00:25:30,410 --> 00:25:33,110
Wouldn't you like to have me all to yourself?

481
00:25:33,240 --> 00:25:38,220
It is Aki-kun's decision who to choose

482
00:25:33,520 --> 00:25:35,400
How dare you say that!

483
00:25:36,060 --> 00:25:38,690
The lines of the flirtatious man

484
00:25:38,220 --> 00:25:45,290
In Aki-kun's mind, there are many girls

485
00:25:45,290 --> 00:25:48,290
But as long as you come back to me

486
00:25:48,290 --> 00:25:51,030
I'm fine with it

487
00:25:51,030 --> 00:25:52,000
Sorry

488
00:25:52,760 --> 00:25:54,400
It's also tough for you, right? Sorry

489
00:25:54,400 --> 00:25:56,910
So I'm not the only one under pressure!

490
00:25:59,570 --> 00:26:00,930
I can't watch it!

491
00:26:02,150 --> 00:26:04,010
How dare you say such things!

492
00:26:02,970 --> 00:26:05,770
But yesterday you chose me

493
00:26:06,250 --> 00:26:07,820
I'll make a deal with you

494
00:26:07,820 --> 00:26:13,220
I will pamper you, and Mike will pamper me
-Yeah

495
00:26:11,510 --> 00:26:13,220
This expression

496
00:26:13,480 --> 00:26:27,800
After that, we can have dinner with other girls and go play together

497
00:26:27,800 --> 00:26:35,270
But I believe you will come back to me in the end

498
00:26:34,210 --> 00:26:36,330
Quite heartfelt

499
00:26:36,330 --> 00:26:38,130
Feels like the real thing

500
00:26:38,740 --> 00:26:42,510
Trust me.
-Ok

501
00:26:40,540 --> 00:26:43,040
Trust me~
-He'll surely betray her

502
00:26:48,250 --> 00:26:50,490
What a great day!

503
00:26:50,040 --> 00:26:51,460
What the hell?

504
00:26:51,760 --> 00:26:52,960
So happy

505
00:26:53,090 --> 00:26:54,420
The opposite of a great day

506
00:26:54,420 --> 00:26:56,540
What a great day!

507
00:26:56,540 --> 00:26:58,680
Anti-great day

508
00:27:00,700 --> 00:27:02,500
Kuro-chan

509
00:27:03,090 --> 00:27:04,170
Who is it?

510
00:27:03,730 --> 00:27:05,300
Good morning

511
00:27:05,300 --> 00:27:06,700
What's going on?

512
00:27:05,530 --> 00:27:06,840
So rare

513
00:27:06,700 --> 00:27:09,240
You slept a long time, right?

514
00:27:07,400 --> 00:27:09,240
The first time?

515
00:27:09,240 --> 00:27:11,280
I'm sorry for sleeping for a long time

516
00:27:11,510 --> 00:27:15,810
Your room has a lot of plastic bottles and a variety of things, right?

517
00:27:15,810 --> 00:27:17,530
It's all been revealed!

518
00:27:17,530 --> 00:27:23,690
I can stretch my legs to sleep in between things

519
00:27:24,390 --> 00:27:25,460
So some say

520
00:27:25,460 --> 00:27:28,210
Seems a lot like Kuro-chan

521
00:27:28,390 --> 00:27:31,300
It's pretty good to have similarities

522
00:27:31,560 --> 00:27:33,760
Pretty good? You're weird

523
00:27:33,760 --> 00:27:35,060
But what's wrong?

524
00:27:35,300 --> 00:27:37,170
Oh... the buffalo

525
00:27:37,170 --> 00:27:39,870
There are places to experience buffalos

526
00:27:39,940 --> 00:27:41,770
What does it mean to experience buffalos

527
00:27:40,070 --> 00:27:41,870
Here?
-In Okinawa

528
00:27:41,870 --> 00:27:42,640
Really?

529
00:27:42,640 --> 00:27:44,420
Can we go together?

530
00:27:42,740 --> 00:27:44,410
Here we go again

531
00:27:44,710 --> 00:27:46,240
Shall we go?
-Let's go

532
00:27:46,240 --> 00:27:46,950
Go on, go on

533
00:27:46,950 --> 00:27:51,290
A buffalo experience surely is plowing a field or something

534
00:27:51,290 --> 00:27:52,620
Enough, you're so annoying!

535
00:27:52,620 --> 00:27:53,680
We get it!

536
00:27:53,680 --> 00:27:54,860
What do you mean experience buffalos

537
00:27:54,860 --> 00:27:57,300
He said it last time

538
00:27:59,690 --> 00:28:01,790
Right at the ass

539
00:28:03,590 --> 00:28:06,170
Ah, it's moving, it's moving

540
00:28:06,160 --> 00:28:09,570
Its horns are impressive

541
00:28:10,200 --> 00:28:14,400
I heard that you eat chocolate while you sleep

542
00:28:10,580 --> 00:28:11,760
Holding hands

543
00:28:14,400 --> 00:28:18,080
Eat chocolate in bed with your eyes closed like this...

544
00:28:18,080 --> 00:28:19,310
Eh, you wouldn't?

545
00:28:19,310 --> 00:28:21,240
No, it's strange

546
00:28:21,240 --> 00:28:22,080
You can try it. You can try it

547
00:28:22,080 --> 00:28:25,410
Not "you can try", its a unique skill

548
00:28:24,740 --> 00:28:28,180
Not much of a good vibe going on

549
00:28:25,820 --> 00:28:29,560
When I got up, I found chocolate all over my back...
-That's not good

550
00:28:29,560 --> 00:28:32,300
So happy

551
00:28:32,620 --> 00:28:35,290
Ah, thank you

552
00:28:35,290 --> 00:28:35,990
So big

553
00:28:36,450 --> 00:28:38,430
So much meat

554
00:28:38,430 --> 00:28:39,370
Looks delicious

555
00:28:38,430 --> 00:28:39,370
Looks delicious

556
00:28:43,730 --> 00:28:44,900
Yummy, yummy!

557
00:28:44,900 --> 00:28:46,900
It's super delicious!
-Super delicious

558
00:28:47,800 --> 00:28:49,440
Ah, you're making mini ramen!

559
00:28:49,440 --> 00:28:50,540
I'm eating it like that

560
00:28:50,540 --> 00:28:52,150
Yes

561
00:28:52,150 --> 00:28:54,610
So youthful

562
00:28:54,880 --> 00:28:58,850
This is how it's done.
-It's so cute!

563
00:28:59,120 --> 00:29:00,020
Can I put green onions too?

564
00:29:00,020 --> 00:29:01,250
Please put in the green onion too

565
00:29:01,250 --> 00:29:02,820
Here we go then

566
00:29:05,590 --> 00:29:07,060
Delicious

567
00:29:06,200 --> 00:29:08,200
Seems very natural!

568
00:29:07,460 --> 00:29:09,350
Are you happy with me?

569
00:29:09,350 --> 00:29:10,460
Very happy

570
00:29:10,460 --> 00:29:12,500
Aren't you happy now?

571
00:29:13,600 --> 00:29:15,700
Super happy
-Happy, right?

572
00:29:15,700 --> 00:29:20,080
To be honest, today is probably the funnest time i've had

573
00:29:19,540 --> 00:29:21,080
Look, you're saying it again

574
00:29:20,470 --> 00:29:23,280
Rapidly heating up

575
00:29:23,280 --> 00:29:25,080
Surprisingly, you like that type of girl

576
00:29:25,080 --> 00:29:26,740
I do!

577
00:29:26,740 --> 00:29:28,350
I really do!

578
00:29:28,650 --> 00:29:31,850
I feel like I can see something I haven't seen before

579
00:29:31,850 --> 00:29:35,120
I thought I was teaching her, but I actually learned a lot

580
00:29:35,390 --> 00:29:37,350
She's more youthful than me, much moreso

581
00:29:37,350 --> 00:29:41,190
So if such a girl says stuff like this to me its hard not to be affected

582
00:29:41,980 --> 00:29:42,660
Okay

583
00:29:45,140 --> 00:29:46,900
Mina
-Impressive!

584
00:29:46,900 --> 00:29:50,200
Heating up rapidly, but only just now

585
00:29:50,200 --> 00:29:56,540
When you see her, it makes you feel like the others are acting.
-That's right

586
00:29:56,540 --> 00:29:59,550
Mina is quite natural

587
00:29:59,550 --> 00:30:03,490
She's natural but not as aggressive

588
00:30:03,490 --> 00:30:10,150
But she's going for it now because she thinks "they're all getting closer"

589
00:30:10,150 --> 00:30:12,650
What do you think, Meruru?

590
00:30:12,650 --> 00:30:17,530
I'm most unsure about Miku

591
00:30:18,460 --> 00:30:23,870
Seeing Kuro-chan so closely he also seems pretty serious

592
00:30:23,870 --> 00:30:28,700
Indeed, it must be tough not to laugh when seeing his CPAP

593
00:30:29,600 --> 00:30:32,180
Isn't that too strange?

594
00:30:32,710 --> 00:30:35,790
"Because I have apnea." "Oh I see", that was it

595
00:30:35,790 --> 00:30:37,220
So true

596
00:30:37,220 --> 00:30:38,720
Very shocking!

597
00:30:39,750 --> 00:30:41,780
She should have asked more

598
00:30:41,780 --> 00:30:43,550
The person you like wears something like that

599
00:30:43,550 --> 00:30:45,710
I have doubts
-Because of that?

600
00:30:45,710 --> 00:30:47,000
Yeah

601
00:30:51,490 --> 00:30:53,340
Ah, making a snack

602
00:30:53,340 --> 00:30:54,680
She's making her move

603
00:30:54,680 --> 00:30:55,770
Heart-shaped

604
00:31:02,540 --> 00:31:04,210
Ok

605
00:31:07,140 --> 00:31:07,840
I'm back

606
00:31:07,840 --> 00:31:09,150
Welcome back

607
00:31:09,380 --> 00:31:12,500
Ah, great. Baked cookies for me?

608
00:31:12,650 --> 00:31:15,690
Yes, I made cookies for Blackie while I was waiting.
-Well done

609
00:31:16,290 --> 00:31:17,780
Can I have a piece?

610
00:31:17,780 --> 00:31:20,660
Its just finished, wait for it to cool down

611
00:31:23,060 --> 00:31:25,260
By the way, we

612
00:31:26,700 --> 00:31:28,040
Bought fireworks

613
00:31:28,270 --> 00:31:29,830
Great!

614
00:31:30,930 --> 00:31:32,350
Looks fun

615
00:31:37,410 --> 00:31:40,490
Whoever's goes out first loses!

616
00:31:40,680 --> 00:31:42,140
What?

617
00:31:42,140 --> 00:31:43,480
What a boring rule

618
00:31:43,880 --> 00:31:45,880
So fast, so fast, so fast!

619
00:31:46,750 --> 00:31:48,030
Ri's is so fast

620
00:31:48,680 --> 00:31:51,440
Don't you have any originality?

621
00:31:53,520 --> 00:31:55,560
It's really fun!

622
00:31:56,330 --> 00:31:59,370
How has living together been?

623
00:31:59,700 --> 00:32:02,070
Every day goes by so fast

624
00:32:03,130 --> 00:32:05,270
We went to a lot of places, aquariums and so on

625
00:32:06,540 --> 00:32:08,040
And had fun at the beach

626
00:32:09,740 --> 00:32:11,980
Flew away

627
00:32:11,980 --> 00:32:13,540
The one who was flung away

628
00:32:13,840 --> 00:32:16,610
To be honest, I'm happy

629
00:32:16,610 --> 00:32:20,680
Being with everyone like this

630
00:32:20,680 --> 00:32:23,050
You say you like me

631
00:32:24,140 --> 00:32:26,820
I hope that lasts forever

632
00:32:27,060 --> 00:32:31,530
It's tough to think people will still be eliminated

633
00:32:33,230 --> 00:32:38,000
Although we are rivals, everyone has a good relationship

634
00:32:38,000 --> 00:32:41,740
It would be nice if we could continue to be together

635
00:32:42,110 --> 00:32:44,840
Oh, I'm so happy.
-Yes

636
00:32:44,840 --> 00:32:47,710
5 people doing fireworks together

637
00:32:47,710 --> 00:32:50,310
Ah yes, didn't you bake cookies?

638
00:32:51,410 --> 00:32:52,820
Let's eat

639
00:32:52,820 --> 00:32:54,190
Miku made them

640
00:32:54,190 --> 00:32:56,420
I'm so happy!
-So happy!

641
00:32:56,420 --> 00:32:58,300
It's cooled down

642
00:32:59,920 --> 00:33:02,520
I want to eat it

643
00:33:05,260 --> 00:33:06,200
Eh?

644
00:33:06,610 --> 00:33:08,900
What?

645
00:33:10,400 --> 00:33:13,250
They're all broken...

646
00:33:12,460 --> 00:33:13,760
Someone's up to something

647
00:33:15,440 --> 00:33:16,470
Why?

648
00:33:16,470 --> 00:33:17,190
Why?

649
00:33:18,780 --> 00:33:20,130
What is this twist?

650
00:33:20,690 --> 00:33:22,310
A new genre

651
00:33:22,750 --> 00:33:25,350
I put them here

652
00:33:25,350 --> 00:33:26,620
Why is it like this?

653
00:33:25,930 --> 00:33:27,980
Someone is angry?

654
00:33:29,390 --> 00:33:32,550
Did someone accidentally knock it off?

655
00:33:32,550 --> 00:33:34,970
Someone must have done it on purpose

656
00:33:32,760 --> 00:33:33,990
No

657
00:33:33,990 --> 00:33:36,260
I didn't come down from the room

658
00:33:35,090 --> 00:33:36,260
Jealousy

659
00:33:36,260 --> 00:33:39,330
It looks suspicious. At first glance, Richi is the most suspicious

660
00:33:36,260 --> 00:33:39,330
Why is it broken like this?

661
00:33:46,150 --> 00:33:47,690
This expression...

662
00:33:46,800 --> 00:33:49,400
Eh? Who did it? No way...

663
00:33:49,850 --> 00:33:59,180
No, everyone came with great anticipation

664
00:33:59,780 --> 00:34:01,650
Eh? Who did this?

665
00:34:00,720 --> 00:34:03,000
I want to stop and take notes

666
00:34:04,000 --> 00:34:05,500
Want to review again

667
00:34:05,360 --> 00:34:07,390
Definitely not me

668
00:34:08,760 --> 00:34:12,430
We went on several dates

669
00:34:12,660 --> 00:34:16,400
Spent a lot of time together

670
00:34:16,570 --> 00:34:24,010
Although looking at you guys like this I've always been jealous

671
00:34:18,250 --> 00:34:21,490
She cries all the time!

672
00:34:27,340 --> 00:34:31,110
I would never do such a thing...

673
00:34:31,110 --> 00:34:33,220
But now you suspect me again

674
00:34:33,220 --> 00:34:36,130
And you'll stick up for Miku

675
00:34:39,090 --> 00:34:46,700
The relationship between you two will deepen further

676
00:34:46,700 --> 00:34:49,860
More difficulties...

677
00:34:50,130 --> 00:34:52,700
So who did it?

678
00:34:54,900 --> 00:34:57,810
I think it was Miku

679
00:34:57,580 --> 00:34:59,140
Baked it herself, smashed it herself?

680
00:34:58,540 --> 00:34:59,580
Miku?

681
00:34:59,580 --> 00:35:01,160
I think she broke it herself

682
00:35:00,500 --> 00:35:01,660
I see

683
00:35:04,360 --> 00:35:05,560
I see

684
00:35:05,560 --> 00:35:07,150
To make someone a villain

685
00:35:10,320 --> 00:35:14,430
I also think it was Miku

686
00:35:20,600 --> 00:35:24,400
You think so?

687
00:35:24,400 --> 00:35:24,830
Yeah

688
00:35:30,870 --> 00:35:34,280
I'm sorry. I'm sorry

689
00:35:34,280 --> 00:35:35,850
I know it's hard for you too

690
00:35:36,150 --> 00:35:41,150
I didn't expect the blame to be placed on you

691
00:35:42,130 --> 00:35:43,760
What is this plot?

692
00:35:45,680 --> 00:35:48,050
A sudden twist

693
00:35:57,630 --> 00:35:59,100
Crying!

694
00:36:01,340 --> 00:36:04,040
Surely not, why would you do such a thing

695
00:36:04,040 --> 00:36:09,320
Although not me, but I do not want to suspect others

696
00:36:08,220 --> 00:36:10,180
The good girl routine

697
00:36:16,570 --> 00:36:18,210
Really?

698
00:36:18,210 --> 00:36:20,190
Not resolved yet?

699
00:36:20,560 --> 00:36:22,980
Tough

700
00:36:20,890 --> 00:36:22,690
A lot of things happened just now

701
00:36:22,830 --> 00:36:25,360
But I still want to rank properly

702
00:36:26,090 --> 00:36:27,770
What'll happen?

703
00:36:29,330 --> 00:36:35,840
The person's name who isn't called will have to say goodbye

704
00:36:33,310 --> 00:36:35,830
Will the first place change this time?

705
00:36:36,440 --> 00:36:39,380
1st place is

706
00:36:44,980 --> 00:36:45,980
Richi

707
00:36:50,220 --> 00:36:53,450
He trusts her

708
00:36:54,260 --> 00:36:58,090
2nd place is

709
00:36:56,770 --> 00:36:58,820
It'll be impressive if Miku isn't included

710
00:36:58,820 --> 00:37:00,880
Will he eliminate her?

711
00:37:03,370 --> 00:37:04,000
Miku

712
00:37:04,340 --> 00:37:05,650
She fell in the rankings

713
00:37:08,000 --> 00:37:09,920
The ranking has changed

714
00:37:09,920 --> 00:37:12,210
Will she come forward?

715
00:37:12,280 --> 00:37:14,880
In 3rd place...

716
00:37:16,510 --> 00:37:21,420
For the person whose name isn't called, its goodbye

717
00:37:25,460 --> 00:37:28,790
Hamada, what do you think of Mina?

718
00:37:28,790 --> 00:37:31,190
Don't you think it's a little too natural?

719
00:37:31,190 --> 00:37:33,100
Don't even use honorifics

720
00:37:33,100 --> 00:37:35,600
You care about that?
-Courtesy?!

721
00:37:38,680 --> 00:37:42,420
Mami, who was active at the beach

722
00:37:43,370 --> 00:37:46,740
And Mina whose first date resulted in a rapid increase of good feelings

723
00:37:49,080 --> 00:37:52,180
3rd place is

724
00:37:52,200 --> 00:37:54,230
Who?

725
00:37:54,740 --> 00:37:58,770
Who will be eliminated

726
00:38:00,920 --> 00:38:01,760
Mina

727
00:38:04,480 --> 00:38:06,070
She's eliminated

728
00:38:09,800 --> 00:38:14,680
Today we are saying goodbye to Mami

729
00:38:16,110 --> 00:38:17,840
Ok

730
00:38:17,840 --> 00:38:22,950
If it's related to what just happened, I'd like you to reconsider

731
00:38:22,950 --> 00:38:27,920
If not, I can accept it

732
00:38:28,220 --> 00:38:33,060
Because there is no way for me to trust Kuro-chan

733
00:38:33,990 --> 00:38:43,730
So I think it's better to cut it off here

734
00:38:42,910 --> 00:38:44,090
So?

735
00:38:44,070 --> 00:38:48,740
By the way, do you really like me?

736
00:38:49,040 --> 00:38:50,540
No I don't

737
00:38:55,270 --> 00:38:57,140
What a reaction!

738
00:38:56,080 --> 00:38:57,150
So you don't like me?

739
00:38:57,450 --> 00:38:59,980
No

740
00:39:08,220 --> 00:39:12,860
Didn't you cry at the beginning when you were finally chosen?
-Yes.

741
00:39:13,000 --> 00:39:16,100
Mami, you've passed. Congratulations

742
00:39:16,100 --> 00:39:19,300
Fake tears?

743
00:39:19,470 --> 00:39:22,810
The tears were not fake...

744
00:39:22,810 --> 00:39:25,410
I was happy to be chosen

745
00:39:25,880 --> 00:39:29,390
Regardless of whether I had feelings for you

746
00:39:29,390 --> 00:39:30,530
Straightforward

747
00:39:32,480 --> 00:39:34,100
Ruthlessly heartfelt

748
00:39:34,020 --> 00:39:38,790
This time with Kuro-chan, i've really hated it

749
00:39:40,200 --> 00:39:42,040
So blunt

750
00:39:43,960 --> 00:39:47,300
Thank you

751
00:39:44,770 --> 00:39:48,470
Thank you?

752
00:39:51,170 --> 00:39:53,500
Please come back.
-Okay

753
00:39:54,480 --> 00:39:57,400
Didn't drag it out

754
00:39:57,400 --> 00:39:59,010
Wants to end it quickly, after all

755
00:39:59,010 --> 00:40:00,790
Can't help it

756
00:40:01,960 --> 00:40:03,380
"Please come back"

757
00:40:07,750 --> 00:40:10,490
She said, "I don't like Kuro-chan at all"

758
00:40:10,490 --> 00:40:12,420
And is she angry?

759
00:40:12,420 --> 00:40:14,230
Very angry

760
00:40:14,520 --> 00:40:17,800
And also said she hated out time together

761
00:40:18,290 --> 00:40:20,100
Super scary

762
00:40:20,100 --> 00:40:22,730
Why should...

763
00:40:22,730 --> 00:40:26,770
It is obvious that I was cheated, why are you angry at me?

764
00:40:28,050 --> 00:40:30,500
Luckily I eliminated her

765
00:40:31,370 --> 00:40:38,450
If I had been more active

766
00:40:38,450 --> 00:40:41,460
Maybe it won't be so

767
00:40:42,020 --> 00:40:47,290
I never thought it would end this way

768
00:40:45,990 --> 00:40:47,170
Hmm?

769
00:40:47,690 --> 00:40:53,700
Because I thought by getting to this point I could become an idol

770
00:40:55,600 --> 00:40:58,100
What is the story behind this

771
00:40:56,600 --> 00:40:59,070
Very reluctant

772
00:40:58,100 --> 00:41:00,480
What's going on, idol?

773
00:41:03,620 --> 00:41:05,300
Good morning, everyone!

774
00:41:05,300 --> 00:41:06,710
Good morning

775
00:41:06,710 --> 00:41:09,680
I am Watanabe, the president of WACK

776
00:41:09,570 --> 00:41:12,010
It was about this?

777
00:41:09,980 --> 00:41:12,010
This time we called everyone over

778
00:41:12,620 --> 00:41:17,790
Some of you may want to be idols, and some of you don't

779
00:41:18,250 --> 00:41:20,090
This selection session

780
00:41:20,090 --> 00:41:26,170
Is judged by "being liked by Kuro-chan"

781
00:41:26,620 --> 00:41:31,580
Yes, MONSTER LOVE, without the knowledge of Kuro-chan

782
00:41:31,580 --> 00:41:36,350
Was a simultaneous love project and idol audition

783
00:41:36,440 --> 00:41:37,840
So that's the reason!

784
00:41:37,970 --> 00:41:40,100
I get it now

785
00:41:40,100 --> 00:41:45,080
Except for those who really like Kuro-chan

786
00:41:45,080 --> 00:41:49,150
The others are audition participants who want to become idols

787
00:41:49,150 --> 00:41:50,700
No point otherwise

788
00:41:50,720 --> 00:41:52,820
Kuro-chan once also said

789
00:41:52,820 --> 00:41:55,190
"If I can't get one person to like me"

790
00:41:55,190 --> 00:41:58,630
"I can't get many people to like me"

791
00:41:59,160 --> 00:42:01,700
I also agree with this statement

792
00:42:01,700 --> 00:42:04,540
I hope everyone will work hard

793
00:42:05,270 --> 00:42:05,960
Ok

794
00:42:05,960 --> 00:42:11,410
And I hope that you will try to capture Kuro-chan's heart

795
00:42:10,650 --> 00:42:12,220
So that's it!

796
00:42:11,770 --> 00:42:12,280
Ok

797
00:42:12,560 --> 00:42:14,470
This is the real theme

798
00:42:18,110 --> 00:42:21,960
This time it's down to three people
-Yes

799
00:42:22,320 --> 00:42:24,290
A lot has happened today too

800
00:42:24,290 --> 00:42:26,190
A lot of things?

801
00:42:26,190 --> 00:42:27,220
For example, the cookie incident

802
00:42:27,220 --> 00:42:29,160
Ah, the cookie incident

803
00:42:29,760 --> 00:42:31,460
That was me

804
00:42:34,960 --> 00:42:36,130
That's scary!

805
00:42:36,770 --> 00:42:38,170
Eh?

806
00:42:38,170 --> 00:42:42,270
Well, I broke the cookies

807
00:42:42,610 --> 00:42:44,440
Why would you do such a thing?

808
00:42:44,440 --> 00:42:45,680
Why?

809
00:42:45,680 --> 00:42:48,110
If it's just eating cookies

810
00:42:48,110 --> 00:42:50,810
Everyone will say "tastes good" and nothing more

811
00:42:50,980 --> 00:42:54,450
So by breaking them

812
00:42:54,450 --> 00:42:58,250
I get to see how they'll respond

813
00:42:58,250 --> 00:43:02,990
How will the one I like act?

814
00:43:01,310 --> 00:43:03,600
Awesome

815
00:43:03,290 --> 00:43:07,520
So I heard everyone's heartfelt words

816
00:43:07,520 --> 00:43:09,800
Good thing I did

817
00:43:10,230 --> 00:43:12,540
Oh my, it was amazing

818
00:43:12,540 --> 00:43:16,910
I never thought it would be so effective

819
00:43:18,440 --> 00:43:20,150
Very successful

820
00:43:21,990 --> 00:43:23,650
So scary

821
00:43:27,450 --> 00:43:28,520
Okay

822
00:43:28,520 --> 00:43:30,350
So, everyone

823
00:43:30,350 --> 00:43:33,510
Wait a minute wait a minute wait a minute

824
00:43:36,100 --> 00:43:39,250
When he said "it was me" just now

825
00:43:39,300 --> 00:43:40,360
I really wanted the CPAP

826
00:43:40,360 --> 00:43:41,510
You don't need it, right?

827
00:43:41,510 --> 00:43:42,370
Apnea?

828
00:43:42,370 --> 00:43:43,870
My breathing was suspended

829
00:43:43,870 --> 00:43:45,230
Scared to death!

830
00:43:45,230 --> 00:43:47,010
I was really shocked

831
00:43:47,010 --> 00:43:50,350
Everyone was shocked!

832
00:43:50,350 --> 00:43:55,580
When the girls were arguing Kuro-chan's face was expressionless

833
00:43:55,580 --> 00:43:57,850
Now when you think about it, it's super scary

834
00:43:58,690 --> 00:44:01,450
Rewind, please look at his expression

835
00:44:01,450 --> 00:44:04,060
There are girls crying

836
00:44:04,060 --> 00:44:06,670
If I watch it at home

837
00:44:06,670 --> 00:44:08,700
I eat after watching Wednesday Downtown

838
00:44:08,700 --> 00:44:09,960
We eat late

839
00:44:09,960 --> 00:44:12,560
I probably wouldn't be able to eat

840
00:44:12,560 --> 00:44:14,700
You can still eat, right?

841
00:44:14,700 --> 00:44:17,200
I rarely skip dinner

842
00:44:17,830 --> 00:44:20,700
Cold all over

843
00:44:20,700 --> 00:44:22,700
Can't sleep

844
00:44:23,370 --> 00:44:25,370
This project is poisonous

845
00:44:25,370 --> 00:44:27,880
There was also other stuff

846
00:44:27,880 --> 00:44:34,720
"Eh, be an idol?" That was pretty shocking, wasn't it

847
00:44:34,720 --> 00:44:35,890
What is this?

848
00:44:35,890 --> 00:44:41,130
To become an idol, you have to make Kuro-chan like you

849
00:44:41,130 --> 00:44:46,360
So all the people eliminated who don't like him

850
00:44:46,360 --> 00:44:50,570
They shed tears for the path of the idol

851
00:44:51,500 --> 00:44:55,580
After that, came a stronger dose of poison

852
00:44:59,300 --> 00:45:00,980
It was very painful at the end

853
00:45:01,280 --> 00:45:04,680
Doesn't like anything about him

854
00:45:06,580 --> 00:45:08,200
"I've hated it"

855
00:45:08,680 --> 00:45:10,860
You hated it?

856
00:45:10,860 --> 00:45:14,000
Then said "thank you"

857
00:45:14,000 --> 00:45:15,180
"Please come back"

858
00:45:15,180 --> 00:45:17,230
"Please come back." "Thank you."

859
00:45:17,230 --> 00:45:22,440
It's Kuro-chan's fault they wont become an idol

860
00:45:22,440 --> 00:45:25,500
I wanna watch it all back from the first one

861
00:45:25,500 --> 00:45:28,310
The meaning of the words has all changed

862
00:45:28,310 --> 00:45:30,410
Very interesting. Every sentence

863
00:45:30,410 --> 00:45:32,640
Indeed

864
00:45:32,640 --> 00:45:34,210
So, there are two parts left

865
00:45:34,210 --> 00:45:35,850
This is it for today?

866
00:45:35,850 --> 00:45:37,580
That's it for today. But there's two more parts

867
00:45:37,580 --> 00:45:40,080
Its the end of the day and we're going home?
-That's it

868
00:45:40,080 --> 00:45:41,020
I feel so uncomfortable

869
00:45:43,290 --> 00:46:14,980
