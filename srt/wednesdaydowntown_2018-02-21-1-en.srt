4
00:00:02,400 --> 00:00:05,120
Welcome to Wednesday Downtown everybody!

5
00:00:05,120 --> 00:00:07,120
Welcome!

6
00:00:05,120 --> 00:00:07,120
Welcome!

7
00:00:07,120 --> 00:00:11,110
Okay let's start this. Here is our first presenter, please!

8
00:00:14,620 --> 00:00:16,700
Oo, hello everyone!

9
00:00:16,700 --> 00:00:20,000
It's Yoshimura from Heisei Nobushi Kobushi!!

10
00:00:20,000 --> 00:00:22,100
Hi everybody!

11
00:00:21,240 --> 00:00:22,100
Oh it's Yoshimura!

12
00:00:22,100 --> 00:00:25,800
I am funny guy Yoshimura! I'll be in your care!

13
00:00:25,800 --> 00:00:28,280
Ok let's get to...

14
00:00:26,580 --> 00:00:28,280
Are you funny today as well?

15
00:00:28,280 --> 00:00:29,740
What is it?

16
00:00:28,760 --> 00:00:29,740
Are you funny today as well?

17
00:00:29,740 --> 00:00:34,320
I'm funny today, as well as yesterday and tomorrow. I'm funny guy!

18
00:00:34,540 --> 00:00:39,280
Sorry, I can't think of anything funny but THAT fact I can say.

19
00:00:39,280 --> 00:00:40,360
Everybody,

20
00:00:40,360 --> 00:00:43,300
By the way do you know the word "match fixing"?

21
00:00:43,300 --> 00:00:44,920
Yes

22
00:00:44,920 --> 00:00:49,880
It basically means that the winner and loser are known before the match...

23
00:00:49,880 --> 00:00:52,020
and it just becomes a meaningless/show match.

24
00:00:52,020 --> 00:00:54,900
Oh, it's like that hmm...

25
00:00:53,760 --> 00:00:54,900
It's already known, yeah?

26
00:00:55,440 --> 00:00:59,680
I have brought with me a theory about match fixing.

27
00:01:00,240 --> 00:01:01,600
Here it is!

28
00:01:02,140 --> 00:01:05,540
Theory: A fixed match where both parties are told to lose...

29
00:01:05,560 --> 00:01:09,120
...will still be an exciting match to watch!

30
00:01:07,980 --> 00:01:09,120
Ah that's evil!

31
00:01:09,120 --> 00:01:11,180
That's what's going on...

32
00:01:09,440 --> 00:01:11,180
Ahh...

33
00:01:12,480 --> 00:01:16,200
Probably gonna be like "What you gonna do?"

34
00:01:13,720 --> 00:01:16,200
That's evil!

35
00:01:16,460 --> 00:01:22,100
We're trying to see what will happen if both parties are told to lose.

36
00:01:19,440 --> 00:01:22,100
wouldn't it be okay if one of them cued the other.

37
00:01:22,100 --> 00:01:25,000
Cue the other?

38
00:01:22,900 --> 00:01:25,000
If one of them gave a cue to the other

39
00:01:25,000 --> 00:01:27,240
Like "Let's stop this yeah?"

40
00:01:27,240 --> 00:01:30,380
I'm sorry it's our first meeting but, what the hell are you saying?

41
00:01:30,820 --> 00:01:33,860
After this, the forbidden double fixed match!

42
00:01:34,280 --> 00:01:37,640
Will it truly become a battle you can't take your eyes away from?

43
00:01:38,840 --> 00:01:44,300
After that, using raw eating power and cooking skills, who will be the one to consume the most wheat flour?

44
00:01:44,300 --> 00:01:46,500
Go! Go! Go! Go! Go! Go! Go!

45
00:01:45,420 --> 00:01:46,500
And then,

46
00:01:46,840 --> 00:01:52,180
*Aya is a female pro wrestler

47
00:01:46,840 --> 00:01:52,180
A theory about whether anyone other than herself can get Aya face paint correctly.*

48
00:02:08,420 --> 00:02:15,760
Theory: A fixed match where both parties are told to lose will still be an exciting match to watch!

49
00:02:16,820 --> 00:02:23,980
This time, the battle will unfold in the fake sports show Samurai 2018

50
00:02:19,060 --> 00:02:21,820
Aah seems likely

51
00:02:24,460 --> 00:02:32,730
Being the world cup this year, this is the catchphrase: "We also have battles you DEFINITELY have to WIN!"

52
00:02:26,200 --> 00:02:28,800
Waah that's a big banner!

53
00:02:30,360 --> 00:02:33,160
It really looks like a TBS special show right?

54
00:02:33,780 --> 00:02:37,480
Celebrities confident in their physical abilities have been gathered

55
00:02:34,860 --> 00:02:38,400
That's gonna be interesting

56
00:02:35,480 --> 00:02:38,400
Wow that's gonna be hard...

57
00:02:38,740 --> 00:02:43,980
Today, is a "qualification" setting, but just before the battle...

58
00:02:44,480 --> 00:02:51,420
...the contestants will be informed by their managers that even if they win...

59
00:02:51,420 --> 00:02:54,740
...their schedule is full on the day of the finals.

60
00:02:54,740 --> 00:02:57,520
Resulting in a complete 180 to the show's theme:

61
00:02:57,520 --> 00:03:01,420
We also have battles you DEFINITELY have to LOSE!

62
00:03:01,420 --> 00:03:04,760
Getting us the complete fixed matches

63
00:03:05,640 --> 00:03:09,360
The first battle is: Beach Flags

64
00:03:06,260 --> 00:03:08,980
That'll put them on spot!

65
00:03:10,180 --> 00:03:12,480
The first target...

66
00:03:10,180 --> 00:03:12,480
What will they do?

67
00:03:13,520 --> 00:03:19,560
Penalty's Wakkii, the person who won Beach Flags against the top of the entertainment industry.

68
00:03:13,940 --> 00:03:15,920
Oh it's Wakkii

69
00:03:17,960 --> 00:03:22,840
He'd hate being found out the most

70
00:03:19,640 --> 00:03:21,710
Oh it's this kind of hardness..

71
00:03:21,300 --> 00:03:22,840
That's right

72
00:03:22,580 --> 00:03:25,900
First off, the explanation of the fake show...

73
00:03:26,220 --> 00:03:29,540
...and getting him accustomed to the set.

74
00:03:28,800 --> 00:03:31,020
So they check stuff like that...

75
00:03:30,280 --> 00:03:35,460
Then, giving him plenty of practice time to not seem suspicious

76
00:03:34,740 --> 00:03:37,240
Oh! He really got in there

77
00:03:36,800 --> 00:03:38,830
That feels so good!

78
00:03:40,230 --> 00:03:42,100
It'll be better to go barefoot

79
00:03:42,100 --> 00:03:44,280
His bangs are awesome

80
00:03:43,870 --> 00:03:45,700
It's fine if I go barefoot yeah?

81
00:03:44,540 --> 00:03:45,700
No problem whatsoever.

82
00:03:46,060 --> 00:03:50,420
It's time for the "losing meeting"

83
00:03:50,800 --> 00:03:53,280
Waah, I'd hate that

84
00:03:53,360 --> 00:03:56,660
Will he accept the fixed match?

85
00:03:56,660 --> 00:03:58,660
This is a great moment

86
00:03:57,820 --> 00:04:00,250
I'll go barefoot.

87
00:04:00,250 --> 00:04:02,920
Does it seem okay?

88
00:04:01,120 --> 00:04:02,920
It's better barefoot...

89
00:04:03,880 --> 00:04:09,140
Wakkii's getting fired up for the big special show, but the manager

90
00:04:07,960 --> 00:04:12,040
Wakkii probably wants to win too...

91
00:04:10,060 --> 00:04:12,040
Feels real

92
00:04:13,130 --> 00:04:17,500
Uhm, there's something that I have to apologize for...

93
00:04:19,400 --> 00:04:22,810
The qualification will be done just after this right?

94
00:04:23,480 --> 00:04:29,110
The finals will be next month if you can win...

95
00:04:28,010 --> 00:04:29,110
Next month?

96
00:04:29,110 --> 00:04:30,250
The finals

97
00:04:31,380 --> 00:04:35,790
Unfortunately, your schedule doesn't really fit...

98
00:04:35,790 --> 00:04:37,520
Whaaa...

99
00:04:37,520 --> 00:04:40,930
The finals? If I can make it?

100
00:04:42,100 --> 00:04:44,920
Uhm, yeah if that happens

101
00:04:44,920 --> 00:04:49,100
Wakkii getting double booked unexpectedly

102
00:04:49,600 --> 00:04:53,910
And now, to the fixing

103
00:04:54,840 --> 00:04:59,610
I haven't said anything to the staff yet either..

104
00:04:59,610 --> 00:05:02,680
About you not being able to be there.

105
00:05:02,910 --> 00:05:13,290
So you'll kinda have to lose on purpose...

106
00:05:10,020 --> 00:05:13,290
Hmm, I understand.

107
00:05:13,860 --> 00:05:18,830
I need you to lose some way...

108
00:05:18,830 --> 00:05:20,700
Really??

109
00:05:20,970 --> 00:05:26,270
"I need you to lose some way" saying that in a sentence is weird...

110
00:05:26,700 --> 00:05:31,640
Here Wakkii realizes the biggest point of the match fix

111
00:05:31,810 --> 00:05:36,110
Without making the staff go...

112
00:05:39,950 --> 00:05:43,590
"What's happening?"

113
00:05:43,590 --> 00:05:46,360
That's what I have to do right?

114
00:05:46,360 --> 00:05:49,090
Yes of course

115
00:05:47,390 --> 00:05:49,090
Yeah right...

116
00:05:49,620 --> 00:05:55,930
Yes, what is being looked for now is not to seem suspicious to the staff and the opponent

117
00:05:55,930 --> 00:05:58,000
A real match fixing.

118
00:05:58,470 --> 00:06:00,370
Makes me feel like hell

119
00:06:01,000 --> 00:06:03,200
Meanwhile...

120
00:06:04,060 --> 00:06:06,380
Wakkii's opponent,

121
00:06:09,040 --> 00:06:12,660
Naitou Daisuke's warm-up is coming to an end

122
00:06:13,420 --> 00:06:14,750
I wanna win

123
00:06:14,920 --> 00:06:16,820
He looks like he'd suck at it

124
00:06:16,960 --> 00:06:18,720
Naitou looks like he'd be bad

125
00:06:17,260 --> 00:06:18,720
That's right

126
00:06:18,820 --> 00:06:20,630
I was told by staff...

127
00:06:20,630 --> 00:06:23,630
...that if you win, the finals will be March 24th

128
00:06:24,900 --> 00:06:28,670
That day, you have a special show with NHK

129
00:06:28,900 --> 00:06:31,470
And, it's hard saying this to the Champion but..

130
00:06:31,470 --> 00:06:34,040
If you win, it'd be quite bad

131
00:06:34,040 --> 00:06:36,300
It's like, what could we do?

132
00:06:36,340 --> 00:06:38,640
The only way is to lose

133
00:06:39,560 --> 00:06:42,850
Somehow, the match fixing idea came from the target himself

134
00:06:40,140 --> 00:06:42,720
From himself

135
00:06:43,010 --> 00:06:45,350
Were the staff not pissed?

136
00:06:43,100 --> 00:06:45,240
Somehow the Champion...

137
00:06:45,350 --> 00:06:49,190
I haven't really told the staff...

138
00:06:49,360 --> 00:06:51,040
This means...

139
00:06:51,040 --> 00:06:54,700
Both sides going for the loss at full force

140
00:06:54,380 --> 00:06:55,700
It's started!

141
00:06:54,700 --> 00:06:58,940
We have battles you DEFINITELY have to LOSE!

142
00:06:55,700 --> 00:06:56,560
This is gonna be fun!

143
00:06:56,560 --> 00:06:57,940
So entertaining!

144
00:06:58,040 --> 00:06:59,660
It's the start!

145
00:06:59,400 --> 00:07:01,400
What's gonna happen??

146
00:07:01,470 --> 00:07:03,200
It's over if you get the flag,right?

147
00:07:03,200 --> 00:07:06,320
You can't clearly throw yourself, right?

148
00:07:03,700 --> 00:07:08,100
Now, the qualification matches for SAMURAI 2018 Beach Flag will take place

149
00:07:09,040 --> 00:07:14,540
Celebrities will compete in different challenges, SAMURAI 2018

150
00:07:14,840 --> 00:07:17,940
The Beach Flag qualifications will be under way

151
00:07:17,220 --> 00:07:20,620
Wow he's really doing the serious face isn't he?

152
00:07:18,320 --> 00:07:20,780
Only one of the competitors...

153
00:07:20,780 --> 00:07:26,560
...will win and advance to the finals

154
00:07:24,780 --> 00:07:28,200
That means that face is a lie, right?

155
00:07:27,260 --> 00:07:33,300
If both sides go for the loss, will it still truly be an exciting match?

156
00:07:29,400 --> 00:07:31,120
Wow this is interesting

157
00:07:33,840 --> 00:07:39,280
From now on, we will have the announcer speak from the fixed match point of view

158
00:07:40,540 --> 00:07:45,280
Now, a match you wouldn't believe both sides are trying to lose

159
00:07:45,380 --> 00:07:48,310
It's better to go barefoot

160
00:07:49,000 --> 00:07:52,780
Saying that but still putting on his shoes

161
00:07:53,300 --> 00:07:55,280
Wow he really put them on

162
00:07:53,850 --> 00:07:55,520
The only way is to lose

163
00:07:56,160 --> 00:07:59,780
On the other side is the Champion Naitou who accepted the loss very quickly

164
00:07:57,960 --> 00:08:01,980
Quickly accepted

165
00:07:58,960 --> 00:08:01,980
Not quickly accepting, giving the idea himself

166
00:08:00,180 --> 00:08:02,780
In what way will they try to lose?

167
00:08:03,000 --> 00:08:06,520
A fixed match you can't take your eyes from will begin

168
00:08:06,520 --> 00:08:09,400
This is amazing, I think I'm not gonna be able to watch

169
00:08:07,340 --> 00:08:10,060
A high tension Beach Flag qualification battle

170
00:08:09,420 --> 00:08:11,680
You really can't watch this

171
00:08:10,700 --> 00:08:14,260
It has started! Wakkii falling straight away!

172
00:08:14,440 --> 00:08:18,480
Naitou taking the lead after Wakkii's magnificent fall

173
00:08:18,480 --> 00:08:20,720
He's in a real pinch!

174
00:08:20,720 --> 00:08:25,100
How will he come through with a loss?

175
00:08:23,380 --> 00:08:25,240
I can't even laugh

176
00:08:25,100 --> 00:08:28,580
What are you gonna do Naitou-san?

177
00:08:26,240 --> 00:08:28,520
What will you do Naitou?

178
00:08:28,580 --> 00:08:29,980
Naitou-san was late as well though...

179
00:08:29,980 --> 00:08:34,740
Wakkii falling straight away! What will Naitou do? He dives in the wrong direction!

180
00:08:35,160 --> 00:08:38,200
He dives in the wrong direction!

181
00:08:40,240 --> 00:08:42,600
He dives in the wrong direction!

182
00:08:42,600 --> 00:08:46,420
Oh! He doesn't go for the flag!

183
00:08:43,860 --> 00:08:47,420
Wahh I hate this! I can't watch it!

184
00:08:46,420 --> 00:08:49,480
What will he do in this situation?

185
00:08:47,960 --> 00:08:50,740
I don't want to watch this!

186
00:08:49,660 --> 00:08:51,340
Naitou!

187
00:08:50,740 --> 00:08:53,640
Don't take it Naitou!

188
00:08:51,440 --> 00:08:55,620
He got the flag!

189
00:08:51,580 --> 00:08:53,640
Wah he got it!

190
00:08:55,620 --> 00:08:59,880
Naitou who has no time in his schedule for the finals has won the battle!

191
00:08:56,000 --> 00:08:58,600
That kind of situation is hell

192
00:09:01,420 --> 00:09:03,520
He isn't pleased at all

193
00:09:02,080 --> 00:09:07,960
On the other hand we have Wakkii acting an expression of sadness

194
00:09:04,220 --> 00:09:06,920
Wakkii was clever

195
00:09:08,430 --> 00:09:10,760
Wakkii-san...Wakkii-san..

196
00:09:10,760 --> 00:09:12,630
Why did you fall man?

197
00:09:12,630 --> 00:09:14,100
I just fell down by accident

198
00:09:14,100 --> 00:09:15,570
I shouldn't have worn shoes...

199
00:09:15,570 --> 00:09:17,700
That wasn't his best, right?

200
00:09:17,700 --> 00:09:20,540
It wasn't...It was okay if I won but...

201
00:09:22,360 --> 00:09:26,060
Here we explain the prank to Naitou to ease his unrest

202
00:09:26,510 --> 00:09:28,410
Naitou-san

203
00:09:28,410 --> 00:09:30,450
Are you okay with winning?

204
00:09:30,450 --> 00:09:31,450
Why is that?

205
00:09:32,540 --> 00:09:34,180
He skipped a heart beat

206
00:09:34,790 --> 00:09:39,420
In fact, this is not "SAMURAI 2018"

207
00:09:39,620 --> 00:09:41,530
It's "Wednesday Downtown"

208
00:09:43,190 --> 00:09:44,200
What the hell?

209
00:09:45,860 --> 00:09:47,770
So THAT's what's going on!

210
00:09:47,770 --> 00:09:48,500
Wait, what the hell?

211
00:09:50,970 --> 00:09:56,810
We told you both to lose to set up a fixed match and to try and see what would be the result

212
00:09:56,810 --> 00:09:59,240
REALLY??

213
00:09:59,240 --> 00:10:01,450
What the hell is that theory man?

214
00:10:01,660 --> 00:10:04,820
Falling down immediately like that, sorry but that really pissed me off

215
00:10:04,980 --> 00:10:06,660
HE FELL DOOOWN!!

216
00:10:06,840 --> 00:10:10,660
I thought "what am I gonna do??"

217
00:10:06,910 --> 00:10:08,740
This is too funny

218
00:10:10,660 --> 00:10:13,650
I thought "Let's not get it then"

219
00:10:13,790 --> 00:10:16,600
He dove in where there was no flag!

220
00:10:16,650 --> 00:10:19,410
Then I thought "Yay! He'll definitely get it!"

221
00:10:19,440 --> 00:10:22,000
"He didn't take it!"

222
00:10:22,070 --> 00:10:24,700
I was running behind...

223
00:10:24,200 --> 00:10:25,560
He's not even close!

224
00:10:24,710 --> 00:10:28,640
...so I saw you not get it when you jumped in!

225
00:10:27,560 --> 00:10:28,630
Right?

226
00:10:28,630 --> 00:10:30,740
I thought "He didn't take it!"...

227
00:10:30,990 --> 00:10:33,680
"Let's not get it either then!" while going for it

228
00:10:33,270 --> 00:10:34,530
It's because it's scary

229
00:10:34,170 --> 00:10:35,650
What are we gonna do?

230
00:10:35,650 --> 00:10:37,650
Why did you fall down man c'mon...

231
00:10:37,820 --> 00:10:40,140
This is something I can't show my kids!

232
00:10:40,460 --> 00:10:44,090
Really funny!

233
00:10:41,210 --> 00:10:43,760
The next fixed match targets are

234
00:10:42,210 --> 00:10:44,090
This is so good!

235
00:10:45,700 --> 00:10:48,530
Eeeh~that's that's not sports...

236
00:10:45,960 --> 00:10:47,610
(I hate this guy)

237
00:10:48,530 --> 00:10:50,310
I can't do that as an athlete

238
00:10:51,330 --> 00:10:52,880
You'd hate doing that

239
00:10:52,910 --> 00:10:55,920
It's completely fine but, it's gonna be tough

240
00:10:56,200 --> 00:11:00,230
Fixed Beach Flag Battle : Round Two

241
00:11:00,830 --> 00:11:02,110
Are they that serious...

242
00:11:01,520 --> 00:11:02,640
What will happen?

243
00:11:02,440 --> 00:11:04,820
There aren't that many patterns

244
00:11:03,500 --> 00:11:04,820
No, there aren't

245
00:11:04,850 --> 00:11:09,810
A real fixed battle where both sides have to convincingly lose

246
00:11:04,960 --> 00:11:07,430
I think there isn't much more than falling down

247
00:11:10,670 --> 00:11:16,440
And the battle has started! It looks real! It looks real! They dove in! But can't seem to get the flag!

248
00:11:16,630 --> 00:11:18,530
What will they do from now on?

249
00:11:18,820 --> 00:11:20,860
They're acting dumb

250
00:11:19,490 --> 00:11:21,790
Hold on a sec...

251
00:11:20,360 --> 00:11:21,790
It's not here!

252
00:11:22,780 --> 00:11:26,270
After a purposely missed flag, acting as though not seeing it!

253
00:11:26,380 --> 00:11:27,930
It's right there!

254
00:11:28,170 --> 00:11:29,360
They can definitely see it!

255
00:11:29,480 --> 00:11:32,100
What's that? HG is hiding the flag!

256
00:11:32,100 --> 00:11:35,240
It's not here!

257
00:11:33,000 --> 00:11:35,240
Really?

258
00:11:34,130 --> 00:11:35,910
This seems like it'll go on for a while!

259
00:11:37,120 --> 00:11:39,240
I can't watch this

260
00:11:40,290 --> 00:11:41,560
This is so embarrassing

261
00:11:40,480 --> 00:11:41,770
It's impossible, I can't find it!

262
00:11:41,770 --> 00:11:47,280
Ogata who absolutely saw the flag is acting as if there was nothing

263
00:11:46,560 --> 00:11:49,290
It's so embarrassing

264
00:11:50,280 --> 00:11:53,780
I'm sorry, I'm sorry it's right here

265
00:11:54,830 --> 00:11:56,890
What?

266
00:11:58,020 --> 00:12:00,380
Now is the reveal of the prank...

267
00:12:00,400 --> 00:12:03,540
Did you get asked to do something?

268
00:12:09,140 --> 00:12:11,250
Is it okay to say? The request?

269
00:12:15,530 --> 00:12:19,250
They told me "The day of the finals...

270
00:12:19,270 --> 00:12:23,520
...you have another thing on your schedule...

271
00:12:23,520 --> 00:12:26,560
...so please lose"

272
00:12:32,150 --> 00:12:33,520
That's a good face

273
00:12:34,240 --> 00:12:35,510
So that's why!?

274
00:12:35,510 --> 00:12:40,370
What the hell is this? Inside of the pit we were like "please get it" in hushed voices

275
00:12:40,360 --> 00:12:42,110
We were telling each other

276
00:12:42,330 --> 00:12:44,550
It got resurfaced during that

277
00:12:46,110 --> 00:12:49,000
You pushed it here once didn't you!

278
00:12:49,580 --> 00:12:53,360
Samurai 2018! The next battle is...

279
00:12:52,600 --> 00:12:55,380
There are patterns other than just running

280
00:12:53,490 --> 00:12:55,680
Fixed musical chairs!

281
00:12:56,870 --> 00:12:59,460
A musical chairs battle of idols and gravure models,

282
00:12:59,570 --> 00:13:03,300
Where sitting down is NOT an option

283
00:13:02,800 --> 00:13:04,890
I probably can't watch this

284
00:13:04,310 --> 00:13:04,890
Right?

285
00:13:05,420 --> 00:13:06,500
The song stopped!

286
00:13:07,270 --> 00:13:09,430
One of them sat down!

287
00:13:09,760 --> 00:13:11,050
Sure it become like this

288
00:13:11,970 --> 00:13:14,510
Did she feel the pressure and sit down?

289
00:13:14,510 --> 00:13:15,510
This is weird

290
00:13:15,510 --> 00:13:17,470
It is, because a chair is available and they're not sitting down

291
00:13:16,110 --> 00:13:17,280
But...

292
00:13:17,280 --> 00:13:20,240
The rest refuse to sit down

293
00:13:22,080 --> 00:13:24,880
Two minutes pass

294
00:13:26,070 --> 00:13:29,920
It became a forfeited match!

295
00:13:27,740 --> 00:13:29,230
This can't happen

296
00:13:30,680 --> 00:13:33,080
Are you feeling ill or something?!

297
00:13:33,620 --> 00:13:37,690
With that, our last category, fixed arm wrestling!

298
00:13:37,940 --> 00:13:39,520
The contestants are...

299
00:13:37,940 --> 00:13:39,520
This is gonna be good!

300
00:13:39,520 --> 00:13:41,950
My pride's on the line man!

301
00:13:39,520 --> 00:13:41,950
There's nothing to do but push

302
00:13:42,430 --> 00:13:45,930
The foreigner who hates to lose: Bobby Ologun

303
00:13:42,540 --> 00:13:45,050
He doesn't like to lose Bobby

304
00:13:45,980 --> 00:13:47,100
And his opponent

305
00:13:47,250 --> 00:13:49,880
What'll happen if I go to the finals?

306
00:13:50,110 --> 00:13:53,800
A bodybuilder as well as an entertainer : Nakayama Kinnikun

307
00:13:52,370 --> 00:13:55,140
Both of them look like they're upset

308
00:13:55,210 --> 00:13:59,570
Two entertainers who really hate to lose

309
00:13:56,010 --> 00:13:58,650
It's hard to try and lose here

310
00:14:01,450 --> 00:14:06,110
What kind of loss will they act out without the opponent noticing?

311
00:14:07,630 --> 00:14:12,100
Now, the battle that you can't lose is starting

312
00:14:12,300 --> 00:14:14,670
Oooh~ they're properly doing this part

313
00:14:12,510 --> 00:14:14,930
First we have a seemingly real grip battle going on

314
00:14:15,160 --> 00:14:20,620
You can't really tell that soon, a farce will play out from here on, amazing reality

315
00:14:19,840 --> 00:14:21,660
You can't show this though

316
00:14:24,720 --> 00:14:25,780
it has begun!

317
00:14:39,760 --> 00:14:44,020
Double fixed match! The third battle will be arm wrestling

318
00:14:45,380 --> 00:14:46,740
Sure enough...

319
00:14:49,590 --> 00:14:50,990
It has begun!

320
00:14:51,380 --> 00:14:53,170
Ah~ They're putting in force!

321
00:14:55,530 --> 00:14:59,770
When you look at it, it seems a like a great battle, but is there really force put in there?

322
00:14:56,670 --> 00:14:59,770
This can't be!

323
00:15:01,830 --> 00:15:02,940
Only the face!

324
00:15:04,240 --> 00:15:10,950
If you look closely you can see that both are trying to pull away from each other

325
00:15:12,160 --> 00:15:14,370
Bobby is pulling at full force!

326
00:15:14,370 --> 00:15:16,670
Kinnikun as well!

327
00:15:18,290 --> 00:15:20,230
They're definitely found out

328
00:15:18,530 --> 00:15:21,440
Their hands separated!

329
00:15:22,850 --> 00:15:24,470
Now a short break

330
00:15:25,020 --> 00:15:27,730
They're doubting something right?

331
00:15:26,240 --> 00:15:27,730
They're thinking like "What?"

332
00:15:27,840 --> 00:15:31,010
They're thinking to themselves "What in the world is going on?"

333
00:15:31,280 --> 00:15:33,540
Both are in a panic state

334
00:15:31,280 --> 00:15:33,540
What's wrong?

335
00:15:34,030 --> 00:15:34,740
What is it?

336
00:15:36,110 --> 00:15:38,200
What?

337
00:15:41,850 --> 00:15:48,520
Bobby looking towards the camera with unease, they'll go at it again while thinking "I somehow have to lose"

338
00:15:47,650 --> 00:15:49,620
He's like "why isn't he pushing?"

339
00:15:49,670 --> 00:15:50,930
"Why is he pulling?"

340
00:15:52,960 --> 00:15:55,820
They're pulling!

341
00:15:57,960 --> 00:16:00,870
Two men going for the "win"

342
00:15:59,340 --> 00:16:01,880
The other side is pulling

343
00:16:00,180 --> 00:16:01,880
Is there nothing else to do?

344
00:16:00,870 --> 00:16:03,180
Something that couldn't happen has happened

345
00:16:03,890 --> 00:16:07,600
A new competition has emerged : Minus Arm Wrestling

346
00:16:13,380 --> 00:16:18,290
Has a battle this amazing happened before? You can't take your eyes away from it!

347
00:16:19,060 --> 00:16:20,690
Bobby sucks at this!

348
00:16:20,330 --> 00:16:24,310
A reverse battle! The two are pulling with their full strength!

349
00:16:21,490 --> 00:16:24,100
They're pulling!

350
00:16:27,390 --> 00:16:30,830
And It's Kinnikun's victory with an amazing display of power!

351
00:16:32,770 --> 00:16:37,010
Nakayama Kinnikun advances to the finals!

352
00:16:37,200 --> 00:16:39,110
I'm really sad!

353
00:16:39,940 --> 00:16:41,750
He really failed there

354
00:16:39,940 --> 00:16:43,980
Now, we explain the prank to the duo that gave it their all

355
00:16:45,110 --> 00:16:47,840
This is not Samurai 2018...

356
00:16:48,180 --> 00:16:49,840
...it's Wednesday Downtown.

357
00:16:49,840 --> 00:16:52,630
Are you kid- ARE YOU KIDDING ME!

358
00:16:53,900 --> 00:16:56,480
When he said "Ready? Go!" we lost the grip instantly...

359
00:16:56,540 --> 00:16:59,050
...and I thought "Wow this is really bad"

360
00:16:59,050 --> 00:17:01,270
Since that can't happen...

361
00:17:01,270 --> 00:17:05,560
That means, you can't have amazing battles even if they are fixed beforehand.

362
00:17:06,710 --> 00:17:07,990
Now that was funny

363
00:17:07,990 --> 00:17:10,720
How did you find that everyone?

364
00:17:11,220 --> 00:17:13,350
An epic battle!

365
00:17:13,360 --> 00:17:17,740
It was wasn't it, that arm wrestling one, a new type of battle got discovered

366
00:17:17,970 --> 00:17:19,660
Where you pull together

367
00:17:19,760 --> 00:17:24,750
Their faces got a bit flustered too didn't they..

368
00:17:24,810 --> 00:17:26,570
Yeah

369
00:17:25,420 --> 00:17:26,560
Uhm...

370
00:17:26,560 --> 00:17:29,570
It's nothing

371
00:17:27,120 --> 00:17:29,560
IT'S NOTHING?! When I ask you a question...

372
00:17:29,620 --> 00:17:31,770
I'm sorry I'm sorry

373
00:17:31,850 --> 00:17:33,790
But she cut me off and said "It's nothing"

374
00:17:33,840 --> 00:17:37,570
I mean it was funny but, you can't really do a second one...

375
00:17:36,620 --> 00:17:37,570
Ahh~ right.

376
00:17:37,600 --> 00:17:41,800
Let's leave this for about a year...

377
00:17:42,110 --> 00:17:43,530
To shoot a lot of them right?

378
00:17:43,530 --> 00:17:45,040
Shoot a bunch?

379
00:17:44,280 --> 00:17:45,040
Right

380
00:17:45,190 --> 00:17:46,880
And then you put them on here

381
00:17:46,880 --> 00:17:50,650
A year later? The people will have aged when you put it on air

382
00:17:51,740 --> 00:17:53,980
Yeah they would have

383
00:17:52,610 --> 00:17:54,300
Is that okay?

384
00:17:53,980 --> 00:17:57,480
We can't even be sure that you will still be around...

385
00:17:57,650 --> 00:17:58,340
You're right

386
00:17:58,610 --> 00:18:01,570
With that said, we didn't go for a year but...

387
00:18:01,650 --> 00:18:05,770
After the shooting, the second part of it is already complete

388
00:18:05,800 --> 00:18:10,800
These losing battles will be aired soon

389
00:18:10,900 --> 00:18:14,020
Let's move on, the next presenter is this person, please come on out!

390
00:18:19,830 --> 00:18:22,760
It's Hamaguchi from Yoiko

391
00:18:22,940 --> 00:18:24,720
I'm Hamaguchi!

392
00:18:24,720 --> 00:18:29,420
I've already come with a lot of mixed rule eating battles on this show but do you remember them?

393
00:18:29,490 --> 00:18:30,930
There were many of them

394
00:18:30,090 --> 00:18:30,930
There were

395
00:18:30,930 --> 00:18:34,960
For example, I was the presenter for the battle between a competitive eater and a pig

396
00:18:35,140 --> 00:18:36,540
Yeah that was it

397
00:18:36,540 --> 00:18:38,980
That was an interesting one

398
00:18:39,340 --> 00:18:41,870
This time I have brought with me...

399
00:18:42,030 --> 00:18:44,450
...a new rule. Here it is!

400
00:18:45,220 --> 00:18:49,170
Mixed rule competitive eating! Consuming a huge amount of barley wheat flour!

401
00:18:53,250 --> 00:18:57,450
It's a battle where you prepare the dishes and eat them

402
00:18:55,120 --> 00:18:57,450
Oh that's what it is

403
00:18:57,450 --> 00:19:01,190
It's not just about your eating, but also about...

404
00:19:01,300 --> 00:19:02,560
...your cooking skills

405
00:19:02,670 --> 00:19:05,940
Can't you just...drink the flour?

406
00:19:06,620 --> 00:19:09,110
That would be a pretty boring video probably

407
00:19:09,560 --> 00:19:13,570
Mixed rule competitive eating! Consuming a huge amount of barley wheat flour!

408
00:19:16,520 --> 00:19:17,800
Sorry but...

409
00:19:17,800 --> 00:19:20,540
I don't wanna do this

410
00:19:20,820 --> 00:19:24,070
This battle's participant are...

411
00:19:24,630 --> 00:19:28,750
With an amazing eating, but no cooking skills...

412
00:19:25,340 --> 00:19:27,420
Oh so she can't cook

413
00:19:28,750 --> 00:19:32,220
...the competitive eater, Angela Satou!

414
00:19:29,760 --> 00:19:31,360
But she can eat

415
00:19:32,220 --> 00:19:35,800
Next we have "the witch" Sugahara Hatsuyo...

416
00:19:33,360 --> 00:19:35,090
She is really good too

417
00:19:34,550 --> 00:19:36,450
Oh she can cook too

418
00:19:35,850 --> 00:19:38,710
...with eating capabilities reaching Angela's...

419
00:19:38,710 --> 00:19:42,480
...she is currently running a bakery and has cooking skills

420
00:19:43,620 --> 00:19:49,470
Next is this duo where one is the cook and the other is the eater

421
00:19:50,600 --> 00:19:54,120
And finally we have the comedian team of three

422
00:19:54,610 --> 00:19:58,410
It's just flour? We can do it! I'm pumped as hell!

423
00:19:59,020 --> 00:20:02,160
Both eating strength and cooking skill are unknown

424
00:20:01,620 --> 00:20:02,650
Ah,a bit more

425
00:20:02,320 --> 00:20:05,220
With the strength of numbers they faced the challenge

426
00:20:03,720 --> 00:20:05,220
Wished he'd taken everything off

427
00:20:05,450 --> 00:20:08,640
Currently, It's 5 minutes to 9 am.

428
00:20:08,640 --> 00:20:10,960
With a time limit: 9am to 9pm

429
00:20:10,960 --> 00:20:13,560
It's going to be 12 hours

430
00:20:11,960 --> 00:20:14,000
That's quite long

431
00:20:13,560 --> 00:20:14,920
Are you stupid?

432
00:20:15,140 --> 00:20:17,780
Wished there was more to him than stripping

433
00:20:16,720 --> 00:20:18,730
Between their different eating power and cooking abilities

434
00:20:17,780 --> 00:20:19,470
Yeah,thought there was more

435
00:20:18,730 --> 00:20:23,470
Exactly which team will consume the most amount of flour?

436
00:20:23,920 --> 00:20:25,840
Our battlefield is set in this rented location

437
00:20:25,840 --> 00:20:28,270
entirely for today's purpose

438
00:20:28,270 --> 00:20:31,280
Flour Mansion

439
00:20:31,880 --> 00:20:34,760
The 4 teams are given ingredients and cooking utensils

440
00:20:31,990 --> 00:20:33,710
In the back,its filled with flour too

441
00:20:34,760 --> 00:20:37,060
and then separated into their respective rooms

442
00:20:37,350 --> 00:20:39,770
They are given enough flour to

443
00:20:39,770 --> 00:20:42,780
carry back and use

444
00:20:43,240 --> 00:20:44,720
5 minutes to 9:00 am

445
00:20:43,400 --> 00:20:44,530
that much?

446
00:20:45,160 --> 00:20:47,920
The showdown is about to begin

447
00:20:48,440 --> 00:20:50,380
Starting with the comedian team

448
00:20:51,180 --> 00:20:53,780
Lets confirm our food supplies

449
00:20:51,380 --> 00:20:53,110
Food

450
00:20:53,250 --> 00:20:55,000
So they share it?

451
00:20:53,780 --> 00:20:55,030
Wow amazing

452
00:20:55,160 --> 00:20:56,720
Ohhhh,There's a ton available

453
00:20:56,720 --> 00:20:57,880
What's all this

454
00:20:57,880 --> 00:20:58,590
Cabbage

455
00:20:59,580 --> 00:21:02,240
Wow, there really is quite a bit

456
00:21:02,240 --> 00:21:04,340
We can make okonomiyaki

457
00:21:04,340 --> 00:21:05,440
Okonomiyaki's good

458
00:21:06,590 --> 00:21:08,930
Let's go with the "Opening Food"

459
00:21:08,480 --> 00:21:10,480
Let's go

460
00:21:08,930 --> 00:21:10,500
Amazing

461
00:21:11,020 --> 00:21:12,510
"Well done food"

462
00:21:12,660 --> 00:21:14,550
The typical flour food

463
00:21:14,550 --> 00:21:17,050
The process of making okonomiyaki

464
00:21:17,050 --> 00:21:18,700
they sure are making a lot

465
00:21:18,700 --> 00:21:22,060
Meanwhile, back at Sugawara's place

466
00:21:19,720 --> 00:21:24,860
Baker? I wonder if she can eat so much bread

467
00:21:22,140 --> 00:21:24,000
make different kinds of bread

468
00:21:24,000 --> 00:21:28,140
I would like to show you that they are many different types and kinds of breads

469
00:21:28,160 --> 00:21:30,620
With her main job being a baker,

470
00:21:31,060 --> 00:21:33,950
She begins making bagels

471
00:21:33,950 --> 00:21:36,580
On the other hand, Angela

472
00:21:35,370 --> 00:21:37,950
That's going to make you bloat

473
00:21:36,940 --> 00:21:40,240
Even if someone like me who can't cook, I can easily make this.

474
00:21:40,360 --> 00:21:43,780
The cuisine she mentioned was: Suiton*

475
00:21:40,360 --> 00:21:46,120
*Suiton is a hearty soup with dumplings,chicken and vegetables from Gunma Prefecture,Japan.

476
00:21:44,880 --> 00:21:47,600
Using only flour and water

477
00:21:47,600 --> 00:21:50,830
she kneads and then boils it

478
00:21:47,620 --> 00:21:49,520
That might work really well

479
00:21:49,960 --> 00:21:52,030
That's going to reduce quite a bit of the flour

480
00:21:50,830 --> 00:21:54,660
Super easy and packed to the MAX with flour

481
00:21:54,750 --> 00:21:57,960
A top dish made just for this challenge

482
00:21:58,990 --> 00:22:01,930
With no time wasted, she embarks on her Suiton Strategy

483
00:22:02,690 --> 00:22:06,640
On the other hand, confidence in his cooking skills, Modegi

484
00:22:06,920 --> 00:22:09,420
If it doesn't taste good, you will not be able to eat large amounts of it

485
00:22:09,420 --> 00:22:11,710
From breakfast

486
00:22:11,710 --> 00:22:13,190
Hearty

487
00:22:13,190 --> 00:22:15,830
Flour based cooking I would like showcase for all to see

488
00:22:15,830 --> 00:22:18,420
kifuu~ Going all out~

489
00:22:18,420 --> 00:22:20,200
Was he such a character before?

490
00:22:19,020 --> 00:22:21,020
And what exactly is he planning to make?

491
00:22:21,120 --> 00:22:23,470
When you speak of flour, you think of gratin

492
00:22:23,970 --> 00:22:25,500
So I would like to make gratin

493
00:22:25,500 --> 00:22:28,430
In terms of ingredients,chicken are the best

494
00:22:27,550 --> 00:22:28,440
Chicken?

495
00:22:28,620 --> 00:22:32,130
Therefore I would like to make chicken gratin

496
00:22:30,220 --> 00:22:32,140
Then I leave it to you

497
00:22:32,740 --> 00:22:34,710
Nakanishi decided that for breakfast

498
00:22:34,710 --> 00:22:37,480
to make chicken macaroni gratin

499
00:22:36,880 --> 00:22:39,220
Can you really use that much flour in gratin?

500
00:22:39,220 --> 00:22:40,790
Shouldn't take much flour

501
00:22:39,680 --> 00:22:41,880
Without delay,

502
00:22:43,010 --> 00:22:46,210
Angela's self styled suiton has been completed

503
00:22:44,080 --> 00:22:46,210
That looks a bit

504
00:22:47,220 --> 00:22:49,500
Brothless and Bland

505
00:22:49,500 --> 00:22:52,040
Rather than Sution it's

506
00:22:52,400 --> 00:22:56,200
closer to lumps of flour

507
00:22:56,200 --> 00:22:59,120
its good and fun to slurp

508
00:22:59,130 --> 00:23:01,810
It feels the same as eating wanton skin

509
00:23:02,540 --> 00:23:04,910
The amount she ate and the amount of flour consumed

510
00:23:04,910 --> 00:23:07,660
has an almost 1:1 ratio

511
00:23:07,660 --> 00:23:09,600
Around 15 Suiton

512
00:23:09,600 --> 00:23:13,480
She has easily consumed 700g of flour

513
00:23:11,780 --> 00:23:13,480
Won't she get tired?

514
00:23:14,380 --> 00:23:16,480
Back here, with the focus on tasty

515
00:23:16,480 --> 00:23:19,170
Modegi has also completed his gratin

516
00:23:19,170 --> 00:23:21,430
Its finally ready. Thank you for waiting

517
00:23:21,430 --> 00:23:23,380
What a great amount

518
00:23:23,380 --> 00:23:25,570
What amazing gratins he made

519
00:23:25,570 --> 00:23:27,160
Alright, diving in, Sensei

520
00:23:26,860 --> 00:23:28,240
Looks really delicious

521
00:23:27,160 --> 00:23:29,470
Filled to the brim with cheese

522
00:23:30,020 --> 00:23:32,160
That does look scrumptious

523
00:23:36,110 --> 00:23:36,970
Delicious

524
00:23:37,660 --> 00:23:40,510
Chicken Macaroni Gratin made for 5 people

525
00:23:40,510 --> 00:23:44,760
clocking in at 1600g calories replacing breakfast

526
00:23:41,640 --> 00:23:42,770
Ah, its getting there

527
00:23:45,670 --> 00:23:46,690
Thank you for the meal

528
00:23:47,240 --> 00:23:48,480
I have finished the meal

529
00:23:50,040 --> 00:23:53,620
However , how much flour was consumed in this dish?

530
00:23:53,620 --> 00:23:56,340
It was a measly 30g

531
00:23:56,340 --> 00:23:58,830
Roughly 3 spoons of flour

532
00:23:58,210 --> 00:24:00,140
He should have made the macaroni out of flour

533
00:23:59,920 --> 00:24:02,360
Due to Modegi's unwavering insistence on taste

534
00:24:02,360 --> 00:24:05,480
The amount of flour spent was just 2%

535
00:24:05,830 --> 00:24:09,660
What a horrendous flour consumption ratio

536
00:24:08,910 --> 00:24:10,480
He ate quite a lot

537
00:24:10,820 --> 00:24:15,200
However, Nakanishi without realizing anything

538
00:24:15,520 --> 00:24:18,940
The others are in survival mode

539
00:24:18,940 --> 00:24:21,600
while I'm the only one chilling in a restaurant feeling happy

540
00:24:22,170 --> 00:24:25,460
In the meantime, Comedian team and Sugawara

541
00:24:25,460 --> 00:24:28,060
Went to get tools which are missing

542
00:24:26,900 --> 00:24:28,360
So that's viable too

543
00:24:28,360 --> 00:24:29,950
They should've brought noodle making tools

544
00:24:29,190 --> 00:24:32,210
Modegi, too heads out to his restaurant

545
00:24:32,900 --> 00:24:34,830
and gets his secret ingredient

546
00:24:35,450 --> 00:24:38,120
Replenishing his kitchen tools with this trip

547
00:24:38,960 --> 00:24:41,040
He's aiming to make good food with his flour

548
00:24:41,040 --> 00:24:44,060
to reduce the most amount of flour

549
00:24:44,070 --> 00:24:48,540
Back to Kotoge which returned from shopping for the comedian team

550
00:24:48,950 --> 00:24:50,200
Ah, you brought back a noodle machine

551
00:24:50,200 --> 00:24:52,920
This is good

552
00:24:51,490 --> 00:24:52,920
You told me to go buy this

553
00:24:53,200 --> 00:24:54,810
They had a noodle machine?

554
00:24:53,860 --> 00:24:55,840
I see

555
00:24:54,800 --> 00:24:55,430
Amazing

556
00:24:55,670 --> 00:24:57,130
It might be delicious

557
00:24:56,440 --> 00:24:58,580
There it is, a hotplate

558
00:24:59,080 --> 00:25:00,620
This is fantastic

559
00:25:01,320 --> 00:25:04,880
Immediately, utilizing the hotplate, the production of okonomiyaki begins

560
00:25:04,880 --> 00:25:09,020
By looks it seems quite crunchy

561
00:25:07,110 --> 00:25:09,020
Delicious

562
00:25:07,460 --> 00:25:08,960
That seems good

563
00:25:08,620 --> 00:25:10,110
The expended flour amount should be reasonable

564
00:25:10,020 --> 00:25:12,600
Between the three of them, two okonomiyakis were consumed

565
00:25:13,580 --> 00:25:17,440
The amount of flour per 200g of okonomiyaki is

566
00:25:17,440 --> 00:25:21,480
25 percent at 50g of the original weight

567
00:25:17,900 --> 00:25:22,500
So its not that useful, losing to suiton

568
00:25:21,480 --> 00:25:23,240
Don't you feel that..

569
00:25:23,240 --> 00:25:26,100
our way of using flour is bad.

570
00:25:24,310 --> 00:25:26,100
The efficiency is bad

571
00:25:25,070 --> 00:25:25,890
This method isn't good enough

572
00:25:26,100 --> 00:25:27,640
Not effective

573
00:25:26,100 --> 00:25:27,640
it has bad churn rate of flour

574
00:25:27,640 --> 00:25:31,090
There probably is a way of increasing the amount of flour used

575
00:25:30,460 --> 00:25:31,480
Udon, they are going to make udon

576
00:25:31,090 --> 00:25:32,260
using another method of eating

577
00:25:32,260 --> 00:25:35,910
Why don't we try eating raw flour mixed with sugar?

578
00:25:34,450 --> 00:25:37,000
Uwa,are you sure about that?

579
00:25:35,960 --> 00:25:38,820
Too bothersome?

580
00:25:36,700 --> 00:25:38,810
Why don't you try it just once?

581
00:25:38,810 --> 00:25:40,330
That's probably for the best

582
00:25:40,860 --> 00:25:44,790
Aiming for the 100% reduction rate of flour

583
00:25:44,790 --> 00:25:48,600
The directly eating flour strategy

584
00:25:48,900 --> 00:25:50,240
its going to be bad

585
00:25:50,270 --> 00:25:51,710
How will it?

586
00:25:50,610 --> 00:25:53,200
Impossible,it can't be

587
00:25:51,700 --> 00:25:53,710
He took a decent mouthful in

588
00:25:59,640 --> 00:26:01,750
Impossible?

589
00:26:02,720 --> 00:26:07,040
Meanwhile, Sugawara who also returned from her shopping trip

590
00:26:07,040 --> 00:26:11,880
Using the home-bakery she brought, she begins making pastries

591
00:26:08,560 --> 00:26:10,140
So its bread

592
00:26:10,360 --> 00:26:11,940
This is going to be useful

593
00:26:11,920 --> 00:26:13,780
Cmon!

594
00:26:13,780 --> 00:26:15,410
Cmon!!

595
00:26:13,780 --> 00:26:16,040
I wonder how it would turn out

596
00:26:15,910 --> 00:26:19,290
At this moment, her bagels were completed

597
00:26:18,680 --> 00:26:20,620
looks delicious

598
00:26:19,800 --> 00:26:22,500
The bagels have good efficiency as 81 percent of the bagel is flour

599
00:26:22,500 --> 00:26:26,110
She consumes 7 of them

600
00:26:26,810 --> 00:26:32,580
On the other hand, prioritizing efficiency over taste is Angela's Suiton Strategy

601
00:26:29,220 --> 00:26:34,580
Back to Angela, and her tasteless suiton method

602
00:26:32,580 --> 00:26:36,160
If there is no change in taste, I will get bored of it

603
00:26:36,160 --> 00:26:39,190
Chicken Soup and...

604
00:26:39,190 --> 00:26:42,760
In order to consume the highly efficient suiton,

605
00:26:41,240 --> 00:26:43,840
That would work

606
00:26:42,030 --> 00:26:45,090
That seems feasible

607
00:26:42,760 --> 00:26:45,680
she forcefully injects flavour into the tasteless suiton

608
00:26:45,680 --> 00:26:48,200
It has the aroma of ramen

609
00:26:49,220 --> 00:26:51,530
This is damn good

610
00:26:51,580 --> 00:26:56,140
She succeeds at her strategy, consuming the huge amount of 800g of flour

611
00:26:56,170 --> 00:26:58,500
by giving it multiple tastes

612
00:26:59,270 --> 00:27:00,200
On the other hand,

613
00:27:00,200 --> 00:27:03,840
Nakanishi who is still waiting for Modegi

614
00:27:03,840 --> 00:27:05,180
Now what should I...

615
00:27:06,920 --> 00:27:08,640
He's wasting his eating capacity

616
00:27:08,640 --> 00:27:11,060
If you eat like this, your stomach will surely fill

617
00:27:09,940 --> 00:27:11,000
For some reason

618
00:27:11,000 --> 00:27:15,280
Wasting his stomach space with something not made with flour

619
00:27:13,290 --> 00:27:14,940
What a waste

620
00:27:14,300 --> 00:27:15,840
Really

621
00:27:15,110 --> 00:27:18,700
He should be training, to build up an appetite

622
00:27:16,080 --> 00:27:19,650
Back to the comedian team who are showing new developments

623
00:27:19,950 --> 00:27:22,180
If its Udon, we can do it

624
00:27:21,410 --> 00:27:22,860
about a 4 person serving

625
00:27:22,180 --> 00:27:24,320
4 persons worth? Lets do 4

626
00:27:24,330 --> 00:27:26,160
4.. Couldn't we go for 6?

627
00:27:26,160 --> 00:27:27,000
6

628
00:27:27,000 --> 00:27:29,020
2,2,2

629
00:27:27,840 --> 00:27:29,020
You said 4 didn't you?

630
00:27:29,020 --> 00:27:29,730
6..6 I said

631
00:27:29,730 --> 00:27:30,780
Can we finish 6 person?

632
00:27:30,780 --> 00:27:32,220
You can down udon easily

633
00:27:32,220 --> 00:27:34,680
No , lets go for 8

634
00:27:35,080 --> 00:27:37,490
isn't he treating it as if its not his problem?

635
00:27:37,490 --> 00:27:42,400
Placing 8 persons worth of flour into the noodle maker

636
00:27:38,420 --> 00:27:41,400
If they normally don't eat that much, it might be impossible

637
00:27:41,640 --> 00:27:43,440
So they really make noodles like this

638
00:27:42,400 --> 00:27:44,740
They wait for 10 minutes

639
00:27:42,690 --> 00:27:44,030
Make it like this?

640
00:27:43,190 --> 00:27:44,370
Really

641
00:27:44,600 --> 00:27:46,830
After waiting,soba will be produced

642
00:27:45,560 --> 00:27:46,550
O..oh here it comes

643
00:27:46,550 --> 00:27:48,250
Wahh

644
00:27:49,750 --> 00:27:51,500
We can really make it like this

645
00:27:51,500 --> 00:27:53,580
Can we?

646
00:27:52,030 --> 00:27:53,600
Look

647
00:27:53,840 --> 00:27:55,510
The result:

648
00:27:54,150 --> 00:27:55,230
Impressive

649
00:27:54,670 --> 00:27:56,160
a bit more

650
00:27:56,160 --> 00:27:57,210
Is it coming out properly?

651
00:27:57,210 --> 00:27:58,350
It's coming out

652
00:27:58,940 --> 00:28:01,990
This will definitely have better efficiency, no matter how I think about it.

653
00:28:00,910 --> 00:28:01,990
Yeah

654
00:28:01,980 --> 00:28:04,640
What will they do with the leftover flour?

655
00:28:02,260 --> 00:28:04,320
Its mostly made out of flour , isn't it?

656
00:28:03,060 --> 00:28:04,320
Yeah,yeah,yeah

657
00:28:03,170 --> 00:28:08,040
They can just add flavouring to it, or make kaki-udon

658
00:28:04,450 --> 00:28:06,770
This is the way isn't it?

659
00:28:06,900 --> 00:28:09,020
We have gotten our hands on an unbelievable item

660
00:28:09,680 --> 00:28:12,810
The Udon are completed

661
00:28:10,710 --> 00:28:12,150
Looks good

662
00:28:14,400 --> 00:28:15,550
Good

663
00:28:15,550 --> 00:28:17,670
It's Udon

664
00:28:16,430 --> 00:28:17,670
Delicious

665
00:28:17,850 --> 00:28:20,030
It's really like Udon

666
00:28:19,380 --> 00:28:20,030
Its chewy and firm

667
00:28:20,030 --> 00:28:22,680
The person who told us to make okonomiyaki was an idiot

668
00:28:22,680 --> 00:28:26,780
At 71% consumption rate of flour, the 8 persons worth of udon

669
00:28:24,160 --> 00:28:27,370
Look, they should have made noodles earlier like I suggested

670
00:28:26,780 --> 00:28:29,540
has been consumed by the three of them

671
00:28:29,540 --> 00:28:32,160
Collectively, they consumed 1kg of flour

672
00:28:32,160 --> 00:28:34,730
There's no need to drink the stock

673
00:28:33,300 --> 00:28:36,870
With their number advantage, will they be able to pull off a miracle?

674
00:28:37,750 --> 00:28:42,000
On the other hand, Still the top choice

675
00:28:40,140 --> 00:28:41,640
That's huge

676
00:28:42,520 --> 00:28:47,000
While the bread is busy baking, I would like to eat okonomiyaki

677
00:28:47,010 --> 00:28:49,930
Living up to her big eater status, she is able to

678
00:28:47,170 --> 00:28:49,330
That's good pace

679
00:28:49,930 --> 00:28:54,290
consume okonomiyaki made for 20 at 4kg.

680
00:28:50,480 --> 00:28:52,410
That's really amazing

681
00:28:54,850 --> 00:28:59,090
Witch Sugawara finally shows her true abilities

682
00:28:59,770 --> 00:29:04,390
Finally Modegi has returned from his workplace

683
00:29:01,930 --> 00:29:04,270
Modegi's so slow

684
00:29:05,080 --> 00:29:08,230
With his tools gathered

685
00:29:05,970 --> 00:29:08,050
There are so much tools

686
00:29:08,610 --> 00:29:10,640
his next dish:

687
00:29:11,310 --> 00:29:15,610
Using tomato sauce to make a Gnocchi styled flour pasta

688
00:29:14,680 --> 00:29:17,200
It turned out really well

689
00:29:16,700 --> 00:29:19,950
At the point where Nakanishi finished eating

690
00:29:21,050 --> 00:29:25,150
It's 3pm, 6 hours since the beginning of the challenge

691
00:29:25,800 --> 00:29:28,530
Therefore it's time for the half time point announcement

692
00:29:28,530 --> 00:29:31,720
Here are the results for the 1st half:

693
00:29:32,980 --> 00:29:35,900
I'm glad

694
00:29:35,110 --> 00:29:38,160
2500g, Angela's amazing

695
00:29:35,990 --> 00:29:40,600
2500g, Angela's amazing

696
00:29:40,600 --> 00:29:41,830
What..

697
00:29:41,830 --> 00:29:43,320
But

698
00:29:43,320 --> 00:29:44,090
isn't it fine?

699
00:29:44,310 --> 00:29:46,760
The comedian team seem to be trying

700
00:29:45,200 --> 00:29:47,400
Huh!?

701
00:29:47,600 --> 00:29:50,070
only 210g

702
00:29:48,520 --> 00:29:50,070
That's the worst

703
00:29:50,070 --> 00:29:52,290
He did too much extra stuff

704
00:29:52,290 --> 00:29:54,950
Modegi sure is hopeless

705
00:29:55,920 --> 00:30:00,000
The flour consumption challenge has finally reached the 2nd half

706
00:30:00,440 --> 00:30:05,880
Sugawara gave Angela a big lead, but her strategy from now on will be...

707
00:30:05,920 --> 00:30:08,320
I understand now that when you keep eating the same exact thing...

708
00:30:08,320 --> 00:30:11,690
...you get really tired mentally

709
00:30:11,690 --> 00:30:14,060
From now on, I will make small amounts of a variety of dishes

710
00:30:14,060 --> 00:30:16,990
Sugawara, who can cook not only bread

711
00:30:16,990 --> 00:30:19,660
But also various other dishes

712
00:30:19,330 --> 00:30:20,230
Ooh it's suiton

713
00:30:20,230 --> 00:30:21,670
Suiton

714
00:30:20,630 --> 00:30:22,500
Ah so suiton is definitely good

715
00:30:22,630 --> 00:30:23,900
Pizza

716
00:30:23,570 --> 00:30:25,340
She can make pizza too?

717
00:30:23,570 --> 00:30:25,340
Waaah

718
00:30:24,800 --> 00:30:26,070
Chijimi*

719
00:30:24,800 --> 00:30:31,010
*Note: Chijimi is Korean dish, like a pancake filled with vegetables

720
00:30:26,670 --> 00:30:27,700
And other barley wheat flour dishes

721
00:30:27,000 --> 00:30:29,010
This person is amazing

722
00:30:27,700 --> 00:30:32,010
With various types and flavors, eaten at small amounts

723
00:30:30,010 --> 00:30:32,010
She's really good

724
00:30:32,010 --> 00:30:34,980
So as to not get too bored

725
00:30:33,610 --> 00:30:36,710
Crepes, I get it

726
00:30:35,950 --> 00:30:37,180
It's really tasty

727
00:30:36,780 --> 00:30:37,780
Wow!

728
00:30:37,680 --> 00:30:41,220
On the other hand, the three people comedian team

729
00:30:41,790 --> 00:30:44,620
We can actually maybe win this

730
00:30:44,620 --> 00:30:48,120
Both Sugawara-san and Angela-san are alone, right?

731
00:30:46,590 --> 00:30:48,390
That sofa is really small isn't it

732
00:30:48,120 --> 00:30:50,490
I think they'll start getting full from now on

733
00:30:49,690 --> 00:30:50,490
Yeah they will

734
00:30:50,490 --> 00:30:51,700
We are three people here

735
00:30:50,830 --> 00:30:52,420
It's because there's three of'em

736
00:30:52,200 --> 00:30:54,800
Taking noodles as their main dish

737
00:30:53,000 --> 00:30:53,860
Oh ramen!

738
00:30:55,230 --> 00:30:58,570
Even showing their ability to make cookies

739
00:30:58,000 --> 00:30:59,240
Ah-

740
00:30:59,000 --> 00:31:01,670
They continue to consume more flour

741
00:31:02,110 --> 00:31:05,810
And then, Angela who's got the lead position

742
00:31:05,810 --> 00:31:07,940
I need to expand the lead to feel safe

743
00:31:06,980 --> 00:31:08,450
Yeah yeah! Go for it!

744
00:31:08,450 --> 00:31:10,410
Will you continue with suiton?

745
00:31:09,250 --> 00:31:10,410
Yes, with suiton

746
00:31:10,410 --> 00:31:14,720
But no matter how you change the flavor, suiton is suiton

747
00:31:13,950 --> 00:31:15,450
That's right

748
00:31:13,950 --> 00:31:15,450
You'll get bored

749
00:31:15,520 --> 00:31:17,120
It's hard

750
00:31:17,590 --> 00:31:19,120
It's getting tougher

751
00:31:18,490 --> 00:31:20,490
Ahh, you can do it Angela

752
00:31:19,860 --> 00:31:23,260
Her lack of cooking skills has started to show

753
00:31:22,630 --> 00:31:25,400
What the hell is this shot?

754
00:31:24,160 --> 00:31:27,730
There's a limit to the suiton strategy

755
00:31:25,400 --> 00:31:27,760
Scary- what's this shot?

756
00:31:28,770 --> 00:31:32,300
Finally, the tag team who's in last place in convincing fashion

757
00:31:31,470 --> 00:31:32,740
Modegi!

758
00:31:32,300 --> 00:31:34,040
After the results get announced

759
00:31:34,540 --> 00:31:38,810
Even a stupid man would notice the problem

760
00:31:38,380 --> 00:31:39,480
Don't call him stupid!

761
00:31:39,240 --> 00:31:43,010
If you try to make things that doesn't use stuff other than flour, like sugar

762
00:31:43,010 --> 00:31:44,380
I think we can do this

763
00:31:44,380 --> 00:31:47,180
We're putting in other stuff so

764
00:31:47,180 --> 00:31:49,750
That might be the problem

765
00:31:48,950 --> 00:31:50,490
The stupid one is talking

766
00:31:49,750 --> 00:31:52,420
But we might also be overthinking the issue

767
00:31:52,420 --> 00:31:56,730
Modegi who got criticized thoroughly

768
00:31:55,890 --> 00:31:57,490
Ah- their teamwork

769
00:31:57,330 --> 00:31:59,900
Prepares this dish next

770
00:31:57,760 --> 00:32:00,530
Both of them are stupid right?

771
00:32:00,730 --> 00:32:03,470
I made something that's creamy

772
00:32:03,430 --> 00:32:05,200
Oh isn't this good! Gnocchi

773
00:32:03,930 --> 00:32:07,600
Barley wheat flour gnocchi pasta with a white sauce

774
00:32:07,440 --> 00:32:10,710
The appearance is good

775
00:32:08,540 --> 00:32:10,270
Also...

776
00:32:10,270 --> 00:32:13,510
...Adding some truffle

777
00:32:10,710 --> 00:32:13,780
Waaah- Modegi

778
00:32:18,110 --> 00:32:20,480
Two hours remain of the challenge

779
00:32:18,880 --> 00:32:20,480
Oh!

780
00:32:20,480 --> 00:32:21,820
How's Angela?

781
00:32:21,080 --> 00:32:24,920
Here's the amount of flour used by each team

782
00:32:22,450 --> 00:32:23,920
Waah she's getting closer!

783
00:32:24,920 --> 00:32:27,290
At the top is Angela but,

784
00:32:27,290 --> 00:32:31,490
Sugawara shows a great performance and the difference between them becomes about 100g

785
00:32:27,860 --> 00:32:30,390
Yeah it's because Angela's getting tired

786
00:32:32,130 --> 00:32:36,470
But unfortunately the other two teams have almost no hope of winning

787
00:32:37,500 --> 00:32:42,710
And we can see the expressions of tiredness on not only Nakanishi's face, but also on the comedians as well

788
00:32:40,740 --> 00:32:42,470
Oh so it's no good

789
00:32:43,340 --> 00:32:46,240
With that said, we take an emergency measure

790
00:32:46,080 --> 00:32:46,710
What is it?

791
00:32:46,940 --> 00:32:52,680
We take the two bottom teams and put them together to give them a chance of winning

792
00:32:48,610 --> 00:32:49,450
That's how...

793
00:32:52,680 --> 00:32:54,450
Idiots + Comedians

794
00:32:55,750 --> 00:32:58,020
Hey there

795
00:32:56,490 --> 00:32:58,020
Hello

796
00:32:58,020 --> 00:32:59,890
I want to share...

797
00:32:59,890 --> 00:33:01,120
...the chef's prime creation

798
00:33:01,830 --> 00:33:06,400
The comedians get their appetite back with the chef's real cooking

799
00:33:05,200 --> 00:33:07,430
They get to eat really tasty stuff

800
00:33:06,400 --> 00:33:07,260
It's tasty

801
00:33:07,260 --> 00:33:09,030
Then I'll have some croquets as well

802
00:33:09,600 --> 00:33:11,600
Nakanishi also

803
00:33:12,270 --> 00:33:13,740
It's done!

804
00:33:13,770 --> 00:33:15,570
On the other hand, Angela...

805
00:33:14,400 --> 00:33:15,570
Go Angela!

806
00:33:15,570 --> 00:33:17,640
Eating has gotten tougher so...

807
00:33:17,640 --> 00:33:19,940
I'm going with a drinking strategy

808
00:33:19,480 --> 00:33:20,380
Drinking??

809
00:33:20,340 --> 00:33:25,820
She creates a shake that's mostly flour

810
00:33:26,620 --> 00:33:28,890
For her last spurt

811
00:33:28,620 --> 00:33:29,990
That's fricking amazing

812
00:33:29,990 --> 00:33:33,760
You can taste the flour more like this...

813
00:33:33,760 --> 00:33:35,770
She made a wonderful thing there

814
00:33:34,560 --> 00:33:38,500
Sugawara is taking out the sweet bread she prepared first thing in the morning

815
00:33:38,500 --> 00:33:42,030
After an 11 hour cooking time

816
00:33:40,800 --> 00:33:42,300
11 hours!

817
00:33:42,730 --> 00:33:44,070
Itadakimasu

818
00:33:44,470 --> 00:33:47,540
She eats what is about 15 times the normal sized sweet bread

819
00:33:47,540 --> 00:33:51,240
1.2 kg of bread completed

820
00:33:50,940 --> 00:33:52,880
Of course she's putting nutella on it

821
00:33:51,710 --> 00:33:53,740
It's 9 o'clock

822
00:33:54,740 --> 00:34:00,150
This battle that lasted 12 hours has come to an end

823
00:33:55,710 --> 00:33:57,850
He cooked so many of them

824
00:33:57,050 --> 00:33:59,140
Modegi made so many of them!

825
00:34:01,180 --> 00:34:06,520
Who has consumed the most barley wheat flour?

826
00:34:02,520 --> 00:34:03,320
Modegi...

827
00:34:03,450 --> 00:34:04,650
Uwah looks tough

828
00:34:06,860 --> 00:34:10,260
Thank you for your 12 hour hard work everybody!

829
00:34:12,160 --> 00:34:13,430
Surprisingly this time,

830
00:34:13,430 --> 00:34:18,670
The difference between the first and third place is only 300g!

831
00:34:17,330 --> 00:34:18,440
Wow

832
00:34:18,670 --> 00:34:20,170
Whaat

833
00:34:18,670 --> 00:34:20,170
What a good match

834
00:34:20,170 --> 00:34:21,500
And the winner is...

835
00:34:25,080 --> 00:34:27,380
With an amount of

836
00:34:27,380 --> 00:34:31,150
4373g

837
00:34:32,150 --> 00:34:33,780
Angela Satou!!

838
00:34:32,680 --> 00:34:33,820
Waah!

839
00:34:35,120 --> 00:34:37,290
YEEAAH!!

840
00:34:36,350 --> 00:34:37,850
Yeaah

841
00:34:38,320 --> 00:34:40,250
She drank flour

842
00:34:38,320 --> 00:34:40,390
WAAAAH!! I DID IT!!

843
00:34:41,790 --> 00:34:43,660
Are you really that happy?

844
00:34:43,660 --> 00:34:46,630
I'm so happy

845
00:34:46,630 --> 00:34:48,200
I get that you're happy but...

846
00:34:48,200 --> 00:34:50,600
...this isn't a project where one would cry

847
00:34:50,600 --> 00:34:52,570
I did it!

848
00:34:52,570 --> 00:34:54,020
You still couldn't win five people

849
00:34:54,020 --> 00:34:56,400
If we can't win like this there's nothing we could do...

850
00:34:56,400 --> 00:34:59,800
As expected, competitive eaters are amazing

851
00:34:59,810 --> 00:35:02,150
His belly is completely full

852
00:35:03,950 --> 00:35:05,680
It's gonna tear apart!

853
00:35:05,580 --> 00:35:07,480
It becomes like this, yeah

854
00:35:07,480 --> 00:35:09,490
Your belly swells up

855
00:35:09,890 --> 00:35:14,860
As a result, we can say that barley wheat flour makes your belly swell

856
00:35:15,430 --> 00:35:18,190
that was amazing

857
00:35:16,290 --> 00:35:18,190
Yeah that's right

858
00:35:18,190 --> 00:35:21,260
In the end, five men couldn't beat a single lady

859
00:35:21,260 --> 00:35:22,100
Yeah

860
00:35:22,100 --> 00:35:24,600
Modegi is stupid though right?

861
00:35:24,800 --> 00:35:25,340
Hey!

862
00:35:25,340 --> 00:35:27,670
He only wanted to show off his cooking skills

863
00:35:26,700 --> 00:35:27,240
Hey!

864
00:35:27,670 --> 00:35:31,040
He didn't use the flour at all!

865
00:35:29,640 --> 00:35:31,040
Didn't use it

866
00:35:31,040 --> 00:35:35,480
Nakanishi is also stupid but Modegi is even MORE stupid!

867
00:35:32,240 --> 00:35:32,780
Hey!

868
00:35:35,480 --> 00:35:39,650
When I saw his tan I thought "He's stupid"

869
00:35:39,650 --> 00:35:42,990
Stupid people don't really eat barley wheat flour then right?

870
00:35:42,990 --> 00:35:45,420
Even if you say "barley wheat coloured"

871
00:35:42,990 --> 00:35:45,420
skin color

872
00:35:45,760 --> 00:35:47,690
That was funny

873
00:35:48,320 --> 00:35:52,600
Next, we have a corner where we show off some theories from the streets

874
00:35:52,600 --> 00:35:55,030
Viewers' Theories!

875
00:35:55,030 --> 00:35:57,430
Tonight's presenter is

876
00:35:58,070 --> 00:36:01,400
It's Kendo Kobayashi!

877
00:36:01,400 --> 00:36:03,240
Hello everyone!

878
00:36:03,710 --> 00:36:07,310
Today we have some academic theories

879
00:36:06,410 --> 00:36:07,310
Ooh

880
00:36:07,310 --> 00:36:11,480
When this airs, the Pyeongchang Olympics will have already started

881
00:36:11,480 --> 00:36:13,720
I think we all know the Olympic Logo right?

882
00:36:13,720 --> 00:36:15,080
The five ring one...

883
00:36:14,180 --> 00:36:15,080
The five ring logo

884
00:36:15,080 --> 00:36:18,890
I think you all know it so...

885
00:36:18,890 --> 00:36:22,030
Do you know remember the order of the colors on it?

886
00:36:22,030 --> 00:36:26,000
You have seen it SO many times but...

887
00:36:26,530 --> 00:36:27,760
The continents

888
00:36:27,760 --> 00:36:29,200
Yes the five continents

889
00:36:29,200 --> 00:36:31,130
The one on the end was black right?

890
00:36:31,130 --> 00:36:31,600
This side?

891
00:36:31,600 --> 00:36:32,200
Eehh

892
00:36:32,700 --> 00:36:34,940
Mori-san do you know any of them?

893
00:36:33,840 --> 00:36:34,670
I...

894
00:36:34,940 --> 00:36:36,870
..feel like the one in the center was green

895
00:36:36,870 --> 00:36:39,310
Oh green right, black and green

896
00:36:39,310 --> 00:36:40,540
Shall I say them?

897
00:36:40,240 --> 00:36:40,540
Yeah

898
00:36:40,540 --> 00:36:41,880
From top left...

899
00:36:41,880 --> 00:36:43,180
Top left okay

900
00:36:43,180 --> 00:36:44,110
Blue

901
00:36:44,110 --> 00:36:45,850
Hmm

902
00:36:45,850 --> 00:36:46,680
Yellow

903
00:36:46,680 --> 00:36:48,220
Hmm yellow

904
00:36:48,220 --> 00:36:48,890
Black

905
00:36:48,890 --> 00:36:51,450
Black was in the center!?

906
00:36:49,920 --> 00:36:51,450
Yes the black is in the center

907
00:36:51,450 --> 00:36:52,720
Green

908
00:36:52,720 --> 00:36:53,760
And red

909
00:36:56,460 --> 00:37:00,960
A logo that you have seen hundreds of time probably

910
00:36:58,700 --> 00:37:00,400
That's right

911
00:37:00,960 --> 00:37:02,330
I couldn't remember

912
00:37:03,200 --> 00:37:06,170
So a human's vague memory

913
00:37:06,670 --> 00:37:07,700
Regarding this...

914
00:37:07,700 --> 00:37:10,310
...the theory I have brought is THIS!

915
00:37:12,010 --> 00:37:16,650
Theory: Nobody but Aya herself can draw her face paint correctly!

916
00:37:16,650 --> 00:37:18,310
Of course they won't!

917
00:37:18,310 --> 00:37:20,050
They won't?

918
00:37:20,050 --> 00:37:21,950
Don't even need to test this...

919
00:37:36,230 --> 00:37:38,940
We're testing the theory that nobody but Aya herself...

920
00:37:38,940 --> 00:37:42,510
...can draw her face paint correctly

921
00:37:48,610 --> 00:37:52,880
Female pro-wrestler Aya Kong's trademark

922
00:37:49,150 --> 00:37:51,110
There's green and blue and

923
00:37:50,080 --> 00:37:51,110
Buru-chan!

924
00:37:53,620 --> 00:37:56,550
Is her face paint, and when you look closely...

925
00:37:53,620 --> 00:37:56,550
She's really grabbing her wow

926
00:37:56,550 --> 00:37:58,010
...the colours are green, red and blue

927
00:38:00,990 --> 00:38:02,060
How's it gonna be?

928
00:38:01,290 --> 00:38:04,830
And the shape is pretty complex

929
00:38:02,060 --> 00:38:04,330
She got it on these parts as well

930
00:38:05,530 --> 00:38:07,400
Can anyone draw this...

931
00:38:05,730 --> 00:38:08,930
Wah you can't get that

932
00:38:07,400 --> 00:38:10,830
...from memory alone?

933
00:38:10,230 --> 00:38:12,600
This is gonna be very hard

934
00:38:11,370 --> 00:38:13,840
First at the pro-wrestling venue

935
00:38:12,600 --> 00:38:14,540
We asked around in a place like this

936
00:38:13,570 --> 00:38:14,540
Oh I get it

937
00:38:14,540 --> 00:38:17,540
We got pro-wrestling fans to give it a shot

938
00:38:16,970 --> 00:38:19,410
If you do it like that maybe some people will get it

939
00:38:18,070 --> 00:38:20,880
Aya kong's face paint is like this!

940
00:38:20,140 --> 00:38:21,110
Oh it's completely different

941
00:38:21,110 --> 00:38:22,450
It's somehow similar

942
00:38:22,450 --> 00:38:24,210
The general shape right

943
00:38:24,650 --> 00:38:27,380
Eeeeh-

944
00:38:27,650 --> 00:38:29,920
It's nothing like it

945
00:38:29,920 --> 00:38:31,990
The shape is different here too

946
00:38:31,490 --> 00:38:33,560
It looks nothing like it

947
00:38:32,560 --> 00:38:36,160
Everyone knew who Aya Kong is but...

948
00:38:33,560 --> 00:38:35,020
Ah very different

949
00:38:36,160 --> 00:38:38,190
..not only were the shapes incorrect...

950
00:38:38,190 --> 00:38:41,630
The colours were wrong too

951
00:38:40,830 --> 00:38:43,070
It's getting mixed up with other wrestlers

952
00:38:42,370 --> 00:38:44,230
That means, next we have

953
00:38:44,230 --> 00:38:47,000
A person who has...

954
00:38:44,230 --> 00:38:47,000
If no one could get it there...

955
00:38:48,040 --> 00:38:50,640
...an active relationship with pro-wrestlers already

956
00:38:50,370 --> 00:38:52,340
He's into this stuff

957
00:38:51,440 --> 00:38:54,180
RG from LaserRamon (partner of Hard-Gay)

958
00:38:52,340 --> 00:38:56,110
You can expect something from him but...

959
00:38:54,910 --> 00:38:58,510
He was in a pro-wrestling club in college

960
00:38:59,020 --> 00:39:03,720
He's even been in the ring himself after becoming a comedian

961
00:39:04,220 --> 00:39:07,390
A very big pro-wrestling fan by all means

962
00:39:06,260 --> 00:39:07,690
Amazing

963
00:39:07,390 --> 00:39:09,830
This theory is about Aya Kong-san but...

964
00:39:08,930 --> 00:39:09,830
Eh

965
00:39:10,930 --> 00:39:15,260
Wha-What about Aya Kong-san is it?

966
00:39:16,170 --> 00:39:18,300
It's about drawing the face paint

967
00:39:18,300 --> 00:39:20,400
Aah...

968
00:39:19,070 --> 00:39:20,400
of Aya Kong-san

969
00:39:20,400 --> 00:39:22,040
...I get it

970
00:39:23,240 --> 00:39:24,310
I get it.. okay

971
00:39:24,240 --> 00:39:25,710
Ah he doesn't remember it does he?

972
00:39:24,310 --> 00:39:26,040
Could you draw it please?

973
00:39:25,780 --> 00:39:27,710
It's quite hard though right

974
00:39:27,640 --> 00:39:30,380
I get it...It's a good question you've got here...

975
00:39:30,380 --> 00:39:32,850
Good question, alright alright

976
00:39:33,780 --> 00:39:37,290
Red- I think there was red- There was definitely red

977
00:39:36,120 --> 00:39:38,150
But was it only that though?

978
00:39:38,050 --> 00:39:40,990
So will RG...

979
00:39:40,990 --> 00:39:44,330
...be able to draw Aya's face paint correctly?

980
00:39:44,330 --> 00:39:45,860
I'm done

981
00:39:45,900 --> 00:39:47,260
If he gets it it'd be awesome

982
00:39:47,230 --> 00:39:50,630
This is Aya Kong-san's face paint!

983
00:39:49,500 --> 00:39:51,500
Ah it becomes like that huh

984
00:39:52,440 --> 00:39:53,870
That's a bit hmm...

985
00:39:53,270 --> 00:39:54,800
Which means...

986
00:39:57,070 --> 00:39:59,680
AAAH! Ouch ouch ouch!

987
00:40:01,560 --> 00:40:05,240
But I knew there'd be green

988
00:40:02,880 --> 00:40:04,180
Ah! There's green!

989
00:40:04,170 --> 00:40:07,040
Hey! You're being pretty modest

990
00:40:07,800 --> 00:40:09,120
That's pretty colorful

991
00:40:09,120 --> 00:40:10,920
There's green...

992
00:40:10,360 --> 00:40:12,250
Yeah there's hella green

993
00:40:10,920 --> 00:40:13,480
And there's blue too...

994
00:40:12,200 --> 00:40:13,480
True true

995
00:40:13,560 --> 00:40:16,420
In total: Red - Blue - Green

996
00:40:16,510 --> 00:40:18,800
Throw some blonde in there

997
00:40:18,800 --> 00:40:22,340
and I could be a traffic light replacement

998
00:40:20,080 --> 00:40:22,340
Very true

999
00:40:24,840 --> 00:40:27,370
In the end, he couldn't draw...

1000
00:40:25,400 --> 00:40:26,810
Is it even possible?

1001
00:40:27,420 --> 00:40:30,840
...that traffic light face

1002
00:40:31,880 --> 00:40:33,840
And with that, our next contestant is

1003
00:40:32,080 --> 00:40:33,840
She's gonna get mad

1004
00:40:34,880 --> 00:40:37,560
Tokyo 03's Toyomoto

1005
00:40:38,840 --> 00:40:43,040
The Industry's No. 1 Pro-Wrestler Enthusiast

1006
00:40:43,120 --> 00:40:45,760
His wife is a pro-wrestler, right?

1007
00:40:43,920 --> 00:40:45,760
Right, because of his wife

1008
00:40:49,960 --> 00:40:51,220
I'm drawing on this right?

1009
00:40:51,080 --> 00:40:53,960
No way he can do this

1010
00:40:51,230 --> 00:40:52,900
Are you feeling confident?

1011
00:40:52,900 --> 00:40:56,750
I'm pretty sure I can do this

1012
00:40:55,450 --> 00:40:56,730
Oh really?

1013
00:40:57,330 --> 00:40:58,350
Your wife...

1014
00:40:58,620 --> 00:41:00,710
She's a pro-wrestler as well

1015
00:41:00,170 --> 00:41:01,380
Miss Mongol

1016
00:41:01,700 --> 00:41:03,980
In regards to this

1017
00:41:03,980 --> 00:41:06,740
I'm probably the best in the entertainment industry

1018
00:41:04,100 --> 00:41:05,560
Even if he couldn't...

1019
00:41:06,080 --> 00:41:08,960
He has to consider the appearance and genre

1020
00:41:08,960 --> 00:41:10,620
3 colors

1021
00:41:10,760 --> 00:41:12,770
Oooh spot on

1022
00:41:11,100 --> 00:41:12,530
Let's use 3 colors

1023
00:41:12,630 --> 00:41:15,170
The eyebrows are in the middle of the red section

1024
00:41:15,230 --> 00:41:17,130
All that's left is the pattern

1025
00:41:16,160 --> 00:41:21,170
A man who's wife is a pro-wrestler, the result is...

1026
00:41:22,830 --> 00:41:25,930
Aya Kong's facepaint looks...

1027
00:41:26,000 --> 00:41:27,800
...like this

1028
00:41:27,600 --> 00:41:29,200
Amazing!

1029
00:41:30,000 --> 00:41:33,600
While the use of colors was mostly accurate...

1030
00:41:33,760 --> 00:41:37,530
...unfortunately, he messed up the positioning of the blue stripe

1031
00:41:36,400 --> 00:41:37,860
but it's pretty close

1032
00:41:37,860 --> 00:41:39,560
Therefore

1033
00:41:39,560 --> 00:41:42,030
What a waste...

1034
00:41:40,360 --> 00:41:42,030
So close!

1035
00:41:42,660 --> 00:41:44,260
Suuuper close

1036
00:41:44,260 --> 00:41:46,130
Well, the fact you were able to get this close

1037
00:41:46,640 --> 00:41:50,460
is pretty amazing

1038
00:41:48,040 --> 00:41:48,860
I know right!

1039
00:41:51,600 --> 00:41:53,940
My neck... you took some skin off

1040
00:41:54,040 --> 00:41:55,660
The blue should be a little bit higher

1041
00:41:56,040 --> 00:41:57,260
Really, not lower?

1042
00:41:57,260 --> 00:41:58,380
No, higher.

1043
00:41:58,910 --> 00:42:01,600
Ah, it goes up to the eyelids

1044
00:41:59,940 --> 00:42:01,600
Mhmm

1045
00:42:02,370 --> 00:42:07,450
Despite being the entertainment world's #1 wrestling enthusiast, he's incorrect.

1046
00:42:04,470 --> 00:42:07,450
He was sooo close

1047
00:42:08,120 --> 00:42:13,070
Next, this active wrestler takes the challenge.

1048
00:42:12,030 --> 00:42:13,710
They both work together

1049
00:42:13,330 --> 00:42:16,550
Is that... Aya's face paint?

1050
00:42:13,330 --> 00:42:16,550
woah, he's way off

1051
00:42:17,000 --> 00:42:20,660
No way he just drew that

1052
00:42:18,600 --> 00:42:20,660
He drew that guy from Warriors

1053
00:42:24,200 --> 00:42:26,400
I was waaaaay off!

1054
00:42:28,760 --> 00:42:32,860
Despite being an active wrestler, he was incorrect.

1055
00:42:32,860 --> 00:42:39,550
Lastly, our next guest has fought countless times with Aya

1056
00:42:34,000 --> 00:42:35,600
Oh right! Bull-chan!

1057
00:42:37,630 --> 00:42:39,550
Shouldn't Bull-chan be able to draw him?

1058
00:42:40,860 --> 00:42:44,560
Former female pro-wrestler, Bull Nakano

1059
00:42:43,160 --> 00:42:44,560
She owns a restaurant now

1060
00:42:45,090 --> 00:42:48,530
We asked Buru about her former wrestling days

1061
00:42:45,480 --> 00:42:46,670
Nakano's

1062
00:42:47,380 --> 00:42:49,560
A store called "Nakano's Bull"

1063
00:42:48,610 --> 00:42:52,590
I wrestled with Aya everyday for about two and a half years

1064
00:42:52,590 --> 00:42:56,460
During that time I stuck pictures of her on the walls in my house

1065
00:42:56,680 --> 00:43:00,730
so I would never forget my hatred

1066
00:43:00,920 --> 00:43:03,940
They've been in my house ever since

1067
00:43:02,140 --> 00:43:03,940
This'll be perfect

1068
00:43:04,760 --> 00:43:05,970
I can do it

1069
00:43:05,970 --> 00:43:08,400
If Bull-chan can't do it, it's impossible

1070
00:43:08,400 --> 00:43:10,960
The final challenger, Bull!

1071
00:43:12,140 --> 00:43:13,570
The result is...

1072
00:43:13,680 --> 00:43:15,960
I'm in trouble if this is wrong

1073
00:43:16,340 --> 00:43:19,330
Aya Kong's facepaint looks like this

1074
00:43:19,490 --> 00:43:21,310
totally wrong

1075
00:43:22,100 --> 00:43:23,500
Hold on, Nakano-san

1076
00:43:23,500 --> 00:43:25,780
Gimme a break!

1077
00:43:29,020 --> 00:43:31,020
Eh?

1078
00:43:29,820 --> 00:43:31,020
Nakano-san

1079
00:43:31,020 --> 00:43:32,280
Excuse me

1080
00:43:32,720 --> 00:43:34,220
As expected of a junior

1081
00:43:34,220 --> 00:43:35,840
That didn't hurt at all

1082
00:43:35,010 --> 00:43:36,020
How nostalgic

1083
00:43:37,880 --> 00:43:42,780
There you have it, it turns out no one was able to correctly draw the facepaint

1084
00:43:43,000 --> 00:43:45,540
Only the real one could do it?

1085
00:43:45,930 --> 00:43:47,530
Subou-san, what did you think?

1086
00:43:47,530 --> 00:43:52,660
I'm happy there was a challenge like this, I can already remember the position of the colours.

1087
00:43:52,750 --> 00:43:54,940
You think could do it if we gave you the challenge?

1088
00:43:55,400 --> 00:43:57,560
Well we're not going to

1089
00:43:57,950 --> 00:44:24,940

00:44:04,570 --> 00:44:05,760
w-what

1094
00:44:06,050 --> 00:44:07,060
And

1095
00:44:07,140 --> 00:44:10,090
I want to leave the group and go solo

1096
00:44:10,280 --> 00:44:13,070
If Jungle Pocket's Ace Saito leaves

1097
00:44:13,070 --> 00:44:16,450
will Oota and Ponkotsu Otake be able to continue on?

1098
00:44:16,450 --> 00:44:17,680
Solo...

1099
00:44:17,680 --> 00:44:18,880
Solo?

1100
00:44:19,300 --> 00:44:21,540
And then, with a height under 150cm

1101
00:44:21,540 --> 00:44:24,400
searching for the strongest 100kg bean-tank
