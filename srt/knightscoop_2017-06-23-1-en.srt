1
00:00:01,500 --> 00:00:03,980
Well then, let's start with today's first request.

2
00:00:04,020 --> 00:00:12,520
As a matter of fact, this time, we've received the same request from various people all over the country.

3
00:00:12,520 --> 00:00:14,580
Isn't that right, Sawabe-san?

4
00:00:14,580 --> 00:00:16,940
Something really unexpected happened.

5
00:00:16,940 --> 00:00:23,860
So, in case you didn't know ... at TV Tokyo, in a show called "Why did you come to Japan?" ...

6
00:00:23,920 --> 00:00:28,380
...they talked to a 19y/o German couple.

7
00:00:28,380 --> 00:00:32,340
It turns out they were huge fans of Tantei Knight Scoop!

8
00:00:32,340 --> 00:00:38,880
So they came all the way from Germany to see Knight Scoop!

9
00:00:39,480 --> 00:00:43,680
Just to see Knight Scoop?
- Yes, just for that purpose!

10
00:00:43,680 --> 00:00:47,440
So did they make it to a taping?
- Well, it was a spontaneous trip.

11
00:00:47,500 --> 00:00:57,580
They came over without knowing anything about the application process, so when they arrived at the recording studio, they weren't able to get inside.

12
00:00:57,660 --> 00:01:05,700
Now after the broadcast, Knight Scoop fans were thinking: "Why don't you invite these fans?"

13
00:01:05,700 --> 00:01:09,760
And that's when we started receiving requests from people all over the country.

14
00:01:09,760 --> 00:01:13,980
So I, Detective Sawabe, took on the case.

15
00:01:13,980 --> 00:01:18,800
Whether they were still in Japan, and whether I was able to find them - please take a look!

16
00:01:18,800 --> 00:01:23,000
Something strange has been happening, take a look.

17
00:01:23,000 --> 00:01:26,300
These are all requests! Strange, isn't it?

18
00:01:26,360 --> 00:01:32,800
We were flooded by clients, so I'm wondering where we should go from here.

19
00:01:32,800 --> 00:01:36,780
We should pay TV Tokyo a visit first of all.

20
00:01:39,500 --> 00:01:45,880
Here we are, we've arrived at TV Tokyo! Shall we head inside?

21
00:01:46,100 --> 00:01:50,700
Excuse me, we're with Tantei Knight Scoop ...

22
00:01:50,700 --> 00:01:54,700
Where would I find the staff members of "Why did you come ...?"
- This way.

23
00:01:54,700 --> 00:01:57,180
This is their staff room?

24
00:01:57,260 --> 00:02:00,480
It looks like a changing room at the beach...

25
00:02:00,540 --> 00:02:02,800
They're completeley isolated for that show.

26
00:02:05,380 --> 00:02:09,440
I contacted you some time ago, yes? Ah, thank you.

27
00:02:09,640 --> 00:02:11,480
Nice to meet you.

28
00:02:11,480 --> 00:02:15,960
The German couple you interviewed, they said they really liked Knight Scoop, right?

29
00:02:15,960 --> 00:02:21,780
Is there a chance you could show us the clip where they said they flew over for that purpose?
- Of course.

30
00:02:23,100 --> 00:02:24,600
So it's these two.

31
00:02:24,600 --> 00:02:27,760
Konnichiha!
- Why did you come to Japan?

32
00:02:34,260 --> 00:02:36,740
It's really funny!

33
00:02:38,100 --> 00:02:39,840
That's lovely.

34
00:02:39,840 --> 00:02:44,200
They'd never expect we'd be watching this together with a Detective...

35
00:03:10,100 --> 00:03:12,140
Would it be ok if we came along?

36
00:03:14,740 --> 00:03:19,780
They're something else, huh? Even as otaku, they're really something else.

37
00:03:19,780 --> 00:03:21,680
Osaka, konnichiha!

38
00:03:21,940 --> 00:03:26,020
By the way, have you scheduled an appointment or anything like that?

39
00:03:26,020 --> 00:03:27,820
Now! Off to ABC TV!

40
00:03:28,400 --> 00:03:29,740
It's no use.

41
00:03:29,740 --> 00:03:33,180
They're not even taping today in the first place.

42
00:03:33,280 --> 00:03:35,100
They seem really
desolate.

43
00:03:35,700 --> 00:03:38,340
Ah~, this is heartbreaking to watch.

44
00:03:38,340 --> 00:03:39,780
That's a shame.

45
00:03:44,060 --> 00:03:46,780
ABC, please!

46
00:03:47,000 --> 00:03:48,180
How adorable!

47
00:03:48,160 --> 00:03:49,860
Next, they revisited memorable locations.

48
00:03:50,200 --> 00:03:51,400
Arrived at Nara Park.

49
00:04:02,200 --> 00:04:04,220
So they went to places like that...

50
00:04:04,220 --> 00:04:07,480
It's like they're on a pilgrimage.

51
00:04:21,800 --> 00:04:23,700
How happy they are...

52
00:04:28,400 --> 00:04:30,840
They're reenacting it.

53
00:04:40,860 --> 00:04:42,280
Respect for the Detectives!

54
00:04:42,540 --> 00:04:43,940
That means a lot.

55
00:04:44,380 --> 00:04:49,720
Somehow, I'm also really moved by this.

56
00:04:49,720 --> 00:04:53,680
When did you film this?
- Around the first half of April.

57
00:04:53,680 --> 00:04:57,040
In other words, they're still in Japan, right?

58
00:04:57,040 --> 00:04:59,620
They might be, just barely.

59
00:04:59,820 --> 00:05:04,660
Do you have an idea where we could find them? - Sure.

60
00:05:04,660 --> 00:05:07,320
We can try.  - Is that ok?

61
00:05:07,920 --> 00:05:11,000
But ... but ... I can't speak English well.

62
00:05:11,040 --> 00:05:13,440
You're useless as a director!

63
00:05:13,520 --> 00:05:16,400
If they've left already, then we're done.

64
00:05:16,520 --> 00:05:18,960
5 minutes later ...

65
00:05:19,100 --> 00:05:21,240
I reached someone. - You did?

66
00:05:21,240 --> 00:05:26,440
It seems they've been staying at a hotel in the Ueno / Asakusa area.

67
00:05:26,740 --> 00:05:34,600
I asked them if they could meet with us again and didn't mention anything about Tantei Knight Scoop. I thought it might be a nice surprise.

68
00:05:34,600 --> 00:05:41,160
Aaah, you're amazing! That'll be fun to see when they find out!

69
00:05:41,300 --> 00:05:43,640
Heading to the hotel where they are staying ...

70
00:05:43,640 --> 00:05:47,880
One of the staff members just went inside the hotel ...

71
00:05:47,880 --> 00:05:53,760
... and she should come out with the two of them in a bit. They still don't know that we're here.

72
00:05:54,600 --> 00:06:00,520
Ah, they're coming, they're here, ahh~, it's them!

73
00:06:00,520 --> 00:06:03,660
How about we go see them in person?

74
00:06:07,800 --> 00:06:09,900
Ah, excuse me. Hello.

75
00:06:10,500 --> 00:06:12,000
Excuse me.

76
00:06:12,960 --> 00:06:18,940
You've been doing an interview, thinking it was for "Why did you come to Japan?", so why did you?

77
00:06:28,340 --> 00:06:32,480
You've cut your hair so much, I almost didn't recognize you!

78
00:06:32,480 --> 00:06:36,080
We came to meet you!
- Thank you so much!

79
00:06:36,080 --> 00:06:38,940
Knight Scoop has been getting so many requests because of you!

80
00:06:39,280 --> 00:06:42,600
Thank you, everyone!

81
00:06:42,600 --> 00:06:44,780
Look how nice they are!

82
00:06:44,780 --> 00:06:48,540
How are you feeling right now?
- Very nervous!

83
00:06:48,540 --> 00:06:53,500
Now because last time didn't work out, you'll finally be able to see Knight Scoop!

84
00:06:53,800 --> 00:06:55,340
Thank you so much!

85
00:06:58,080 --> 00:07:06,260
Sawabe-san~
- You even know my name? Wow! I'm really glad! I'm known in Germany!

86
00:07:06,260 --> 00:07:09,100
So, do you have some time to spare today?

87
00:07:10,240 --> 00:07:12,820
So how about we head out together?

88
00:07:15,900 --> 00:07:24,020
For the two who've come to love Tantei Knight Scoop: W・E・L・C・O・M・E

89
00:07:24,020 --> 00:07:31,280
So as a matter of fact, it so happens that Takeyama-san is also filming in Tokyo today.

90
00:07:31,280 --> 00:07:39,340
We're going to head over now and surprise Detective Takeyama at his shooting location.

91
00:07:39,580 --> 00:07:43,000
The weather is really nice today, isn't it?

92
00:07:39,920 --> 00:07:44,520
We didn't tell Detective Takeyama anything about this.

93
00:07:43,580 --> 00:07:48,180
Excuse me!

94
00:07:48,240 --> 00:07:53,200
He, he, he!
- Konnichiha!

95
00:07:53,200 --> 00:07:55,200
Do you recognize them?

96
00:07:55,460 --> 00:07:56,880
They're famous!

97
00:07:59,260 --> 00:08:03,080
You know about TV Tokyo's "Why did you come to Japan?", right?

98
00:08:03,080 --> 00:08:10,940
They said that they really liked Tantei Knight Scoop.
- Ah, I've heard there was someone like that! - That's them!

99
00:08:10,940 --> 00:08:15,720
You?! What did you come for?

100
00:08:15,720 --> 00:08:19,540
Hello! I'm glad.

101
00:08:23,840 --> 00:08:27,280
So on Friday, they'll attend a taping.
- Ah, is that so?

102
00:08:27,280 --> 00:08:29,960
Fantastic! - We're really glad!

103
00:08:29,960 --> 00:08:32,580
What was it you called the director again?

104
00:08:35,640 --> 00:08:37,220
Thank you!

105
00:08:37,220 --> 00:08:40,380
So ... do you have some more time left?

106
00:08:42,260 --> 00:08:44,940
Then, should we go to Osaka?

107
00:08:45,040 --> 00:08:47,460
To Osaka!

108
00:08:47,460 --> 00:08:49,480
We've arrived in Osaka!

109
00:08:49,480 --> 00:08:51,860
Osaka, konnichiha!

110
00:08:51,900 --> 00:08:53,940
Do you know Tsutenkaku Tower?

111
00:08:56,680 --> 00:08:59,240
Then how about we go there now?

112
00:09:01,960 --> 00:09:05,920
Are there any other people you know, Detectives or otherwise? - Hayashi-sensei!

113
00:09:08,400 --> 00:09:10,620
Oh I see, I see.

114
00:09:11,160 --> 00:09:17,140
Ah, that's a place you know, look - Tsutenkaku!

115
00:09:25,420 --> 00:09:27,940
Do you recognize him? Nonoyama-san!

116
00:09:32,820 --> 00:09:37,000
Seems like he's really popular with you!

117
00:09:37,000 --> 00:09:43,440
Actually, he's come all the way from Nagoya for you.
- Really? Thank you so much!

118
00:09:43,440 --> 00:09:45,900
Isn't there something you want to show them?

119
00:09:49,720 --> 00:09:53,800
Next I'll make it fly using telekinesis.

120
00:09:56,720 --> 00:10:00,040
What a mysterious thing to be shown!

121
00:10:00,040 --> 00:10:02,180
That's all from Nonoyama-san!

122
00:10:02,180 --> 00:10:08,900
So we've arrived all the way at the top. Here, you can scream out whatever you're feeling right now.

123
00:10:15,100 --> 00:10:20,680
I'm so happy, because we get to see Knight Scoop live!

124
00:10:27,600 --> 00:10:32,700
Seeing their eyes light up like this makes me really happy.

125
00:10:35,000 --> 00:10:39,020
But we're not done yet, there's one more place I want to show you!

126
00:10:39,160 --> 00:10:41,380
Off to another place.

127
00:10:41,700 --> 00:10:44,120
I wonder if you'll enjoy this.

128
00:10:44,380 --> 00:10:47,980
We've made it, this way please. It's here.

129
00:11:01,560 --> 00:11:07,560
Konnichiha, Hayashi-sensei!

130
00:11:07,620 --> 00:11:09,960
Hayashi-sensei!

131
00:11:10,000 --> 00:11:16,600
What's going on here? You gave me a call but I still don't know what this is about.

132
00:11:16,600 --> 00:11:20,260
Hello. - Hello.

133
00:11:20,420 --> 00:11:22,080
What's going on?

134
00:11:22,080 --> 00:11:27,020
So they came from Germany because they wanted to see Knight Scoop.

135
00:11:27,020 --> 00:11:32,040
They liked it so much, they decided to come to Japan.

136
00:11:40,120 --> 00:11:43,660
Hold on a second, I should have some ...
- He told us to wait.

137
00:11:43,660 --> 00:11:47,580
These were returned for a different purpose.
- Made by the sensei himself?

138
00:11:47,580 --> 00:11:50,360
Thank you so much!

139
00:11:52,540 --> 00:11:56,980
Hayashi-sensei, it seems you have the presence of an idol! Wow!

140
00:11:57,120 --> 00:11:59,920
Those look delicious...

141
00:12:04,480 --> 00:12:07,640
So good! - It's delicious!

142
00:12:07,640 --> 00:12:12,040
You're a good chef.
- I'm a good chef? Thank you!

143
00:12:12,780 --> 00:12:17,960
So today, in very short time, we've visited a lot of places...

144
00:12:20,200 --> 00:12:24,540
So even when you return to Germany, will you continue to watch Knight Scoop?

145
00:12:27,820 --> 00:12:34,680
And something we thought was just right for you to have when you return home ... the DVD box!

146
00:12:43,980 --> 00:12:47,120
Let's also become Detectives!

147
00:12:47,400 --> 00:12:52,720
And then, their dream finally...

148
00:12:49,300 --> 00:12:52,720
... comes true

149
00:13:09,100 --> 00:13:12,780
Their dream has come true! They've made it to a taping!

150
00:13:13,020 --> 00:13:15,820
Now that your dream has come true, how do you feel?

151
00:13:26,080 --> 00:13:31,280
Looks like you've made the director cry. Cry-guy!

152
00:13:36,700 --> 00:13:40,060
What's it like, seeing Cry-guy in person?

153
00:13:49,480 --> 00:13:55,040
I'm deeply moved, so thank you.
- You're all so funny!
