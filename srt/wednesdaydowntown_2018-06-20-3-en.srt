1
00:00:00,400 --> 00:00:07,400
Coming up: "Everyone's theory corner" - where various theories from around the world are presented and investigated.

2
00:00:07,400 --> 00:00:09,860
And tonight's presenter is ...

3
00:00:10,360 --> 00:00:13,860
It's one half of Saraba Senshuu no Hikari - Morita!

4
00:00:13,860 --> 00:00:15,860
Thank you for having me!

5
00:00:15,860 --> 00:00:16,980
By yourself?

6
00:00:16,980 --> 00:00:20,380
Yes ... today ... yes, by myself, ... well ...

7
00:00:20,560 --> 00:00:25,040
It's just that I don't think you, as a performer, can really ...

8
00:00:25,040 --> 00:00:28,320
Don't reject me already!

9
00:00:28,560 --> 00:00:31,340
It's just you're usually not funny at all.

10
00:00:31,340 --> 00:00:33,620
Don't reject me already!

11
00:00:33,620 --> 00:00:35,880
I'll be quiet.

12
00:00:41,280 --> 00:00:44,240
I didn't hear you, so I'll just laugh over it!

13
00:00:44,680 --> 00:00:46,400
I didn't understand it ...

14
00:00:48,060 --> 00:00:49,740
Well ... anyway!

15
00:00:49,740 --> 00:00:53,640
Is everyone here a morning person? Nakai, what about you?

16
00:00:53,640 --> 00:00:56,400
I'm not a morning person at all. - Ah, you're not?

17
00:00:56,400 --> 00:00:59,300
When I have to get up, I get into a really bad mood.

18
00:00:59,360 --> 00:01:01,760
You get into a bad mood?

19
00:01:01,980 --> 00:01:04,260
But you can still talk to, say, your manager?

20
00:01:04,260 --> 00:01:06,260
Sometimes I can't stand him.

21
00:01:08,820 --> 00:01:11,560
Should you really be saying that on TV?

22
00:01:11,600 --> 00:01:12,800
Probably not too loudly.

23
00:01:12,800 --> 00:01:19,880
So this time, we put the following morning-related plan in motion. Here it is!

24
00:01:21,260 --> 00:01:24,480
Early morning new discipline simulation!

25
00:01:24,480 --> 00:01:29,240
When you think of this program, you're probaby familiar with the "early morning" series.

26
00:01:29,240 --> 00:01:31,720
This is a new installment.

27
00:01:31,720 --> 00:01:34,460
"New disciplines". - Yes, new disciplines!

28
00:01:34,460 --> 00:01:36,460
Is what I've brought you today.

29
00:01:36,880 --> 00:01:37,740
Yes.

30
00:01:40,320 --> 00:01:43,160
Your pacing usually also isn't on point at all.

31
00:01:45,600 --> 00:01:48,400
I'll just laugh over it a little more.

32
00:01:49,940 --> 00:01:54,200
Early morning new discipline simulation - what will be the first contest?

33
00:01:55,380 --> 00:02:01,060
Straight-out-of-bed vs spinning-around-the-bat: a beach flag contest.

34
00:02:02,780 --> 00:02:06,320
In other words, on a certain day in May, at 10:30 pm.

35
00:02:06,320 --> 00:02:10,640
Who is the contestant to be woken up, lured in by the prospect of a fake TV show?

36
00:02:16,900 --> 00:02:17,660
Yes?

37
00:02:17,860 --> 00:02:19,680
We're with Wednesday's Downtown.

38
00:02:19,680 --> 00:02:21,540
Wednesday's Downtown?

39
00:02:21,540 --> 00:02:23,540
Could you come with us for now?

40
00:02:25,260 --> 00:02:27,800
Please put on this eye mask for us.

41
00:02:28,320 --> 00:02:30,440
Isn't this what you do with Kuro-chan all the time?

42
00:02:30,440 --> 00:02:33,860
The clueless Nishimura is taken along ...

43
00:02:33,860 --> 00:02:35,380
The air here is different!

44
00:02:36,160 --> 00:02:39,920
... to the location of the contest: the beach.

45
00:02:40,900 --> 00:02:44,220
And then, after changing clothes, ...

46
00:02:44,220 --> 00:02:47,300
... he's put into a futon.

47
00:02:48,400 --> 00:02:51,000
At 0:30am, late at night ...

48
00:02:51,600 --> 00:02:55,880
... Nishimura has fallen into a deep sleep with the sound of the sea in the background.

49
00:02:56,880 --> 00:03:01,120
WIth this, all preparations for the sleep-contestant are set.

50
00:03:02,320 --> 00:03:05,480
Who will be his opponent, and spin around the bat?

51
00:03:11,540 --> 00:03:14,080
Kasuga from the comedy duo Audrey.

52
00:03:14,500 --> 00:03:18,760
Kasuga is told everything about the contents of this bout.

53
00:03:19,720 --> 00:03:21,820
So am I gonna crush him or what?

54
00:03:22,620 --> 00:03:26,500
He immediately set his eyes on the goal.

55
00:03:27,300 --> 00:03:30,440
4:00am. Everyone has arrived on the beach.

56
00:03:32,220 --> 00:03:38,080
He's completely gone. How can he sleep so well in this kind of place?

57
00:03:38,420 --> 00:03:40,820
No way I'm going to lose here.

58
00:03:41,680 --> 00:03:44,540
If he's sleeping so soundly, he can't get straight into it.

59
00:03:45,180 --> 00:03:52,200
Who will win? Kasuga, spinning around the bat, or Nishimura who is just about to wake up?!

60
00:03:52,520 --> 00:03:54,380
Who will it be?!

61
00:03:55,520 --> 00:03:58,840
First of all, Kasuga has started to spin around the bat.

62
00:03:58,840 --> 00:04:02,420
They will both start, once his preparations are complete.

63
00:04:04,080 --> 00:04:08,260
And with this, Kasuga has just finished his 4th lap around the bat.

64
00:04:09,420 --> 00:04:14,860
Nishimura will be woken up the moment Kasuga finishes his preparations.

65
00:04:16,640 --> 00:04:20,580
Now Kasuga is at 9 laps ... just one more to go!

66
00:04:22,060 --> 00:04:24,360
Wake up! Wake up!

67
00:04:24,360 --> 00:04:28,260
Kasuga is off to a good start, but he can't run straight!

68
00:04:28,360 --> 00:04:29,480
Meanwhile, Nishimura ...

69
00:04:29,480 --> 00:04:33,420
It's a game of beach flag. Please run. - Beach? Where?

70
00:04:34,700 --> 00:04:36,080
Where is it?

71
00:04:36,080 --> 00:04:38,420
He doesn't know where the flag is!

72
00:04:39,400 --> 00:04:40,500
Over there?

73
00:04:41,620 --> 00:04:47,220
But now that Nishimura has found the flag, he's catching up! Who will reach it first?

74
00:04:47,460 --> 00:04:50,640
And Kasuga takes the flag!

75
00:04:50,640 --> 00:04:53,580
How was Nishimura that fast?

76
00:04:54,160 --> 00:05:00,340
In other words, in a straight-out-of-bed vs spin-around-the-bat contest, the bat contestant wins by a narrow margin!

77
00:05:00,480 --> 00:05:02,680
Good morning.

78
00:05:02,920 --> 00:05:05,200
I did it.

79
00:05:07,360 --> 00:05:10,800
How can you talk like that just after waking up?

80
00:05:10,940 --> 00:05:13,080
I wasn't sleeping. Only you were.

81
00:05:13,080 --> 00:05:14,300
What did you have to do?

82
00:05:14,300 --> 00:05:17,380
What I had to do? Spin around the bat.

83
00:05:17,600 --> 00:05:20,280
So it was that, compared to someone who had just woken up?

84
00:05:20,400 --> 00:05:22,360
That's right. - Ah, come on!

85
00:05:23,500 --> 00:05:26,560
But it's funny when you think about it.

86
00:05:27,860 --> 00:05:32,220
What is the next contest in our early morning simulation?

87
00:05:33,120 --> 00:05:36,660
A pair contest! Early morning three-legged race!

88
00:05:37,280 --> 00:05:41,900
Who are the unaware sleeping contestants for this bout?

89
00:05:42,320 --> 00:05:44,340
Razor Ramon, as well as ...

90
00:05:45,200 --> 00:05:46,760
... Kaminari.

91
00:05:47,880 --> 00:05:52,100
We let them sleep for 4 hours, without even knowing that their partner is right next to them.

92
00:05:52,700 --> 00:05:56,880
Which pair will come out victorious?

93
00:05:58,420 --> 00:05:59,820
Please wake up!

94
00:05:59,820 --> 00:06:02,440
And with that, the early morning three-legged race has begun.

95
00:06:02,440 --> 00:06:07,200
The staff will not only wake them up, but also tie their legs together this time.

96
00:06:07,200 --> 00:06:09,200
It's a three-legged race! Please wake up!

97
00:06:09,920 --> 00:06:13,600
It's a three-legged race! Please get up. - Huh?

98
00:06:13,600 --> 00:06:17,100
It's a three-legged race!

99
00:06:17,580 --> 00:06:19,920
Please run for it.

100
00:06:19,920 --> 00:06:21,920
Ah, Takumi is also here?

101
00:06:22,840 --> 00:06:25,560
Razor Ramon off to a good start!

102
00:06:25,660 --> 00:06:27,900
But Kaminari is also on the move!

103
00:06:27,900 --> 00:06:31,000
One, two, one, two, ...

104
00:06:31,140 --> 00:06:32,740
But Razor Ramon is too fast!

105
00:06:32,740 --> 00:06:33,980
Can they keep going?

106
00:06:33,980 --> 00:06:36,200
And just like that, they cross the finish line!

107
00:06:39,160 --> 00:06:42,780
But it seems they haven't noticed the finish line and keep running ...

108
00:06:42,780 --> 00:06:44,720
Where to? How much further?

109
00:06:44,740 --> 00:06:47,180
They couldn't explain the rules like this after all.

110
00:06:47,540 --> 00:06:50,500
And just like that, Kaminari stays in pursuit of Razor Ramon.

111
00:06:50,500 --> 00:06:53,380
And they, too, have already passed the finish line!

112
00:06:54,560 --> 00:06:57,100
It's so far ...

113
00:06:57,620 --> 00:06:59,540
... the goal ...

114
00:06:59,660 --> 00:07:01,040
Where is the goal?

115
00:07:01,320 --> 00:07:04,440
The white line over there was the goal ...

116
00:07:04,620 --> 00:07:06,700
Are you kidding me?

117
00:07:07,260 --> 00:07:10,300
So we didn't have to run a full lap? - We ran 400m.

118
00:07:10,460 --> 00:07:12,660
Ah, so that was the goal?

119
00:07:13,660 --> 00:07:15,860
Why didn't you stop us?

120
00:07:18,560 --> 00:07:22,900
What is the final contest of our early morning simulation?

121
00:07:25,280 --> 00:07:28,140
Early morning futsal!

122
00:07:28,640 --> 00:07:34,900
The rules are as follows: At the sign of the kick-off, the captains of both teams, who are sleeping outside the court, will be woken up.

123
00:07:35,100 --> 00:07:40,980
The captains will then start the game, as they continue to wake up the rest of their team.

124
00:07:41,480 --> 00:07:48,920
And to add to the competition, the time limit for the match as well as waking up every team mate will be 3 minutes.

125
00:07:49,660 --> 00:07:53,620
Who are the captains of this game of early morning futsal?

126
00:07:54,800 --> 00:08:00,340
Two gentlemen who went to school with very strong soccer teams - Penalty's Wakki, as well as Panther's Ogata.

127
00:08:01,280 --> 00:08:03,960
They both fell asleep late at 1:00 am.

128
00:08:04,380 --> 00:08:10,100
And one after another, their team mates were also laid to sleep here.

129
00:08:11,420 --> 00:08:15,220
What kind of match is about to unfold?

130
00:08:17,080 --> 00:08:19,900
And with that, the whistle signifies the beginning of the match!

131
00:08:20,100 --> 00:08:23,800
Wakki, wake up! - Ogata, wake up!

132
00:08:24,440 --> 00:08:27,220
Please wake up! Wake up!

133
00:08:28,680 --> 00:08:30,800
We're playing futsal.

134
00:08:31,160 --> 00:08:32,880
Futsal ... ?

135
00:08:33,100 --> 00:08:36,520
Yes, please wake up! We're playing futsal!

136
00:08:36,520 --> 00:08:38,520
Wakki, you're in the blue team!

137
00:08:38,660 --> 00:08:40,000
The time limit is 3 minutes!

138
00:08:40,000 --> 00:08:44,300
Sorry, my contact lens ... is out of place.

139
00:08:44,540 --> 00:08:47,520
We're playing futsal. It's already begun and the time limit is 3min!

140
00:08:47,820 --> 00:08:49,140
Please do the kick-off!

141
00:08:49,260 --> 00:08:51,240
What should I do?

142
00:08:51,240 --> 00:08:54,200
And finally, both captains make their way to the court!

143
00:08:54,600 --> 00:08:57,220
What kind of match will unfold here?

144
00:08:57,640 --> 00:08:59,740
Who are all these people?

145
00:09:01,680 --> 00:09:04,360
Who are we supposed to wake up?

146
00:09:06,500 --> 00:09:15,200
The two captains are starting off a game of early morning futsal, but since they were woken up, 30 seconds have passed already.

147
00:09:15,340 --> 00:09:18,120
What kind of match will unfold here?

148
00:09:18,340 --> 00:09:21,320
Who are all these people?

149
00:09:22,380 --> 00:09:25,480
Who are we supposed to wake up?

150
00:09:27,640 --> 00:09:29,760
What will they do first?

151
00:09:30,140 --> 00:09:33,460
Do they both understand the situation?

152
00:09:36,380 --> 00:09:37,600
Sorry. - He's blue!

153
00:09:38,140 --> 00:09:43,180
It seems that Ogata has woken up a member of the opposing team!

154
00:09:43,580 --> 00:09:45,240
We're playing futsal.

155
00:09:46,160 --> 00:09:48,540
Good morning Ogata.

156
00:09:48,880 --> 00:09:50,280
Ah, Nakamura!

157
00:09:50,280 --> 00:09:52,280
Wake up, wake up!

158
00:09:52,440 --> 00:09:55,340
Meanwhile, Wakki is waking up his team mates.

159
00:09:55,340 --> 00:10:01,000
This puts the blue team at 3 members already! Meanwhile, Ogata has kicked off the ball!

160
00:10:05,360 --> 00:10:09,260
He enters the penalty zone, shoots, and gooaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaal!

161
00:10:12,780 --> 00:10:19,600
Everyone but the captain is asleep on the red team, but lucky for them, the keeper of the blue team is also sleeping!

162
00:10:20,560 --> 00:10:22,080
Get up!

163
00:10:22,260 --> 00:10:24,840
Wake up! - We're playing futsal.

164
00:10:24,840 --> 00:10:29,060
We're playing futsal. - Wake up the blue team!

165
00:10:32,600 --> 00:10:39,920
It seems both captains have now understood the situation and are increasing the number of players on their team.

166
00:10:40,320 --> 00:10:44,840
Come on, wake up!

167
00:10:45,140 --> 00:10:49,600
The game has resumed, with all 5 players awake on the blue team.

168
00:10:49,600 --> 00:10:55,220
Meanwhile, the red team is leading by one goal despite two players being deep asleep.

169
00:10:55,880 --> 00:10:57,280
Time is running out ...

170
00:10:59,380 --> 00:11:01,060
I'm red ...

171
00:11:02,420 --> 00:11:08,320
But for some reason, the game has slowed down significantly.

172
00:11:09,840 --> 00:11:12,140
Notice the ball at least!

173
00:11:12,700 --> 00:11:14,420
Get up, get up!

174
00:11:15,740 --> 00:11:17,760
Only 25 seconds remaining!

175
00:11:19,500 --> 00:11:22,560
What is the blue team doing? - Wakki with a shot, but it's saved!

176
00:11:23,340 --> 00:11:26,400
Wakki with another shot ... but the keeper saves it!

177
00:11:26,620 --> 00:11:30,400
The ball ... is out of bounds, so a corner kick is awarded!

178
00:11:30,680 --> 00:11:32,980
Will this be the final play of the game?

179
00:11:32,980 --> 00:11:36,140
The kicker will be Regular's Matsumoto.

180
00:11:39,020 --> 00:11:40,800
But there's no power behind the kick!

181
00:11:41,380 --> 00:11:44,920
And with this, the game is over!

182
00:11:46,300 --> 00:11:50,560
We will continue to look into early morning disciplines.
