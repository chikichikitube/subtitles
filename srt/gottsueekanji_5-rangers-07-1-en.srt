The Future Century
Squadron: The Five Rangai!

2
00:00:05,860 --> 00:00:11,980
Speaking of which, I went to
the hospital. - How did it go?

3
00:00:12,320 --> 00:00:16,340
It's nothing. just a little late.
- Good for you.

4
00:00:16,340 --> 00:00:21,000
When I told to the manager,
he is like, "Yes!".

5
00:00:21,000 --> 00:00:29,480
Made me mad. - That's what men are.
They have no idea.

6
00:00:29,740 --> 00:00:30,700
Yes!

7
00:00:31,380 --> 00:00:32,960
Evening.

8
00:00:33,300 --> 00:00:37,300
I didn't think you are such a bad sailor.
You were throwing up all over.

9
00:00:37,300 --> 00:00:38,860
You went on board?

10
00:00:38,860 --> 00:00:42,480
Why did you go? - Why didn't you
tell me you are a bad sailor.

11
00:00:42,520 --> 00:00:45,120
So you guys had a date?
- Shut up! Mind your own business.

12
00:00:47,180 --> 00:00:49,280
What?
- It's for you.

13
00:00:49,280 --> 00:00:54,320
How about a drive then?
- Sure. - I said I know!

14
00:00:54,320 --> 00:00:56,960
Help. Heeelp!

15
00:00:56,960 --> 00:00:58,120
Stop!

16
00:01:00,160 --> 00:01:01,980
Red Rangai!

17
00:01:05,060 --> 00:01:06,900
Blue Rangai!

18
00:01:09,160 --> 00:01:11,940
Pink Rangai!

19
00:01:13,980 --> 00:01:15,540
Yellow Rangai!

20
00:01:16,800 --> 00:01:18,500
Green Rangai!

21
00:01:19,160 --> 00:01:20,500
Our powers combined!

22
00:01:20,500 --> 00:01:21,980
The Five Rangai!

23
00:01:21,980 --> 00:01:26,080
Ladies, run now!
- Thank you.

24
00:01:26,080 --> 00:01:28,300
Lead the way for then, Pink.

25
00:01:28,300 --> 00:01:31,260
Bring it on!

26
00:01:31,740 --> 00:01:35,360
Wait! You seen to be eager to fight.
You really think you can fight?

27
00:01:35,360 --> 00:01:38,020
You must fight with us today.
- Come on!

28
00:01:38,720 --> 00:01:41,840
You said you got a young
lively man last week.

29
00:01:42,580 --> 00:01:44,060
I didn't say he's young.

30
00:01:44,560 --> 00:01:46,600
But I think he's pretty lively.

31
00:01:47,940 --> 00:01:49,560
He's nearly weeping.

32
00:01:51,800 --> 00:01:53,120
How old are you, grandpa?

33
00:01:54,640 --> 00:01:56,500
I'm 81.

34
00:01:57,500 --> 00:01:59,140
Bring it on!
- Stop!

35
00:02:00,340 --> 00:02:04,380
He's 81 for God's sake!
Where did you get him?

36
00:02:05,160 --> 00:02:07,100
He's no problem. Really.

37
00:02:07,740 --> 00:02:13,000
Here. Are you ok?
Let's fight.

38
00:02:13,140 --> 00:02:14,180
Pink Rangai!

39
00:02:17,180 --> 00:02:19,100
Watch out, Pink.

40
00:02:19,400 --> 00:02:22,920
Wait. Look at him.
He doesn't have his heart in this.

41
00:02:23,140 --> 00:02:26,980
Hey!
- This is not Pink Rangai!

42
00:02:27,140 --> 00:02:29,580
He hasn't  recovered
from his brother death.

43
00:02:29,580 --> 00:02:37,340
He said he wants to stay this way
...until the 1st anniversary.

44
00:02:38,500 --> 00:02:44,760
But, he can't hold this. He have to fight.
- Don't you ever touch this.

45
00:02:46,260 --> 00:02:47,360
Pink Rangai!

46
00:02:48,720 --> 00:02:49,360
Cut it!

47
00:02:50,060 --> 00:02:52,600
Don't jab him.

48
00:02:54,400 --> 00:02:56,000
Let me duel him.

49
00:02:56,360 --> 00:02:59,300
Let me see what he's got.
- No!

50
00:03:01,540 --> 00:03:03,840
If he needs your protection...
- Pink Rangai!

51
00:03:04,380 --> 00:03:06,360
Cut it!

52
00:03:08,460 --> 00:03:10,760
Why are you protecting him?
Get out of my way!

53
00:03:11,620 --> 00:03:13,260
You won't get away
without fighting this time.

54
00:03:13,260 --> 00:03:17,640
I said, I will.
- No. Don't mark pink, please.

55
00:03:17,980 --> 00:03:24,760
Fight with 5 of us. Not just with Pink.
- Let's face it. We can't do it with him.

56
00:03:24,900 --> 00:03:26,160
Pink Rangai!

57
00:03:29,020 --> 00:03:31,280
Hey, you went straight to him!

58
00:03:31,280 --> 00:03:32,860
Pink Rangai!

59
00:03:34,960 --> 00:03:37,080
He pisses me off.

60
00:03:37,380 --> 00:03:39,020
The way he say it.

61
00:03:40,380 --> 00:03:41,520
Pink Rangai!

62
00:03:46,060 --> 00:03:48,980
Why do you mark him?
- He's only saying his line.

63
00:03:49,100 --> 00:03:51,940
He's not up to this job.
Think about it!

64
00:03:52,060 --> 00:03:55,680
He's just a little girl.
- He's only an old guy!

65
00:03:55,680 --> 00:03:56,680
He is, at his heart.

66
00:04:00,440 --> 00:04:02,800
You made him gasp!

67
00:04:05,300 --> 00:04:06,600
Pink Rangai!

68
00:04:09,180 --> 00:04:10,220
He peeves me.

69
00:04:11,040 --> 00:04:14,660
Let's us do the job. Only thing
you're doing is trying to attack pink.

70
00:04:17,420 --> 00:04:18,760
Pink Rangai!

71
00:04:21,000 --> 00:04:24,260
He touches my nerve!
He makes me mad!

72
00:04:24,660 --> 00:04:29,520
I don't know why, but he does.
- That's a kind of play on our side.

73
00:04:31,000 --> 00:04:34,540
The way he says it.
What are you doing?

74
00:04:34,540 --> 00:04:35,660
Pink Rangai!

75
00:04:41,040 --> 00:04:44,320
Please.
- No way.

76
00:04:45,340 --> 00:04:47,260
I'm not gonna fight
with this old guy.

77
00:04:47,540 --> 00:04:53,900
We realized we were just bunch of kids
and could use some grown man's help.

78
00:04:54,000 --> 00:04:57,780
He's of no use. He'll only drag you.
Think about it one more time.

79
00:04:58,040 --> 00:05:02,000
Tell me. You think you can do this?
- I'm the only one who can, you idiot!

80
00:05:03,180 --> 00:05:04,840
Come again?

81
00:05:09,440 --> 00:05:15,500
You don't know what you are saying.
- This is his ability, to provoke you.

82
00:05:20,500 --> 00:05:24,000
Ok, well think about it.
- You, what do you think?

83
00:05:24,360 --> 00:05:28,100
I think he's capable. Aren't you?
- Of course!

84
00:05:30,680 --> 00:05:32,600
How can he do the actions?

85
00:05:33,460 --> 00:05:35,920
I'm sure he can't move quickly.
- Yes, he can.

86
00:05:36,220 --> 00:05:38,500
Ok, then let me see it.

87
00:05:39,000 --> 00:05:41,620
Can you do this?

88
00:05:41,960 --> 00:05:43,400
Show him, Pink.

89
00:05:48,560 --> 00:05:49,920
Pink Rangai!

90
00:05:50,840 --> 00:05:53,800
Hey, I get it.
You're making him say it.

91
00:05:54,260 --> 00:05:55,760
Oops!
- You uncover it finally.

92
00:05:56,300 --> 00:05:58,880
Your pat on the back is the cue.

93
00:06:00,680 --> 00:06:04,180
Damn.
- Our secret is disclosed.

94
00:06:05,080 --> 00:06:07,820
That explains his right timing.

95
00:06:08,600 --> 00:06:11,220
You have to say that on air?

96
00:06:11,780 --> 00:06:14,980
No way! I can't fight.
We have to start all over again.

97
00:06:15,940 --> 00:06:17,680
Please give us a little time.

98
00:06:19,820 --> 00:06:22,700
We'll talk about what
we should do about Pink.

99
00:06:25,480 --> 00:06:27,380
You really need do that.

100
00:06:29,400 --> 00:06:31,380
I understand.

101
00:06:33,080 --> 00:06:34,360
What's that for?

102
00:06:36,460 --> 00:06:41,840
What did you touch me for?
- I... will try harder...

103
00:06:44,000 --> 00:06:46,340
I said what's that for!

104
00:06:46,500 --> 00:06:48,880
Pink Rangai!
- Don't act like a puppet!

105
00:06:55,840 --> 00:06:59,720
Thank you very much.
we'll come again next week.

106
00:07:01,660 --> 00:07:04,060
Pink, run, run!

107
00:07:07,980 --> 00:07:11,180
Sorry about that. - Thank you.
- You think it through, OK?

108
00:07:11,700 --> 00:07:18,340
The Future Century Squadron: The Five Rangai!   To be con't.
