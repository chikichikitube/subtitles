1
00:00:00,540 --> 00:00:02,720
The 2nd time on Gaki no Tsukai ya Arahende!

2
00:00:02,720 --> 00:00:07,160
When will Hamada notice, verification test!

3
00:00:10,040 --> 00:00:11,490
It's the 2nd time   -Yes, 2nd time

4
00:00:11,490 --> 00:00:13,380
We did this last February   -Yes

5
00:00:13,380 --> 00:00:16,830
Last February, we pretended to play these world tabletop games

6
00:00:16,830 --> 00:00:22,150
But actually played a few mini pranks on Hamada

7
00:00:22,150 --> 00:00:25,040
To see how far can he Tsukkomi   -Yes, we did

8
00:00:25,040 --> 00:00:26,980
He's probably off his guard now

9
00:00:26,980 --> 00:00:31,720
And won't expect this to come again

10
00:00:31,720 --> 00:00:35,920
So yes, that's why we're doing this again at this timing

11
00:00:35,920 --> 00:00:38,600
But when we were asked to take this opening

12
00:00:38,600 --> 00:00:43,200
Yamazaki-san thought Hamada will be taking this with us

13
00:00:43,200 --> 00:00:45,400
And I'm really shocked now

14
00:00:45,400 --> 00:00:46,630
That's unbelievable

15
00:00:46,630 --> 00:00:48,820
I thought Hamada is coming, and my heart was beating so fast

16
00:00:48,820 --> 00:00:50,190
Because just look at my face...

17
00:00:50,190 --> 00:00:52,250
This is the first prank

18
00:00:53,040 --> 00:00:54,540
So they made it like this, huh?

19
00:00:54,540 --> 00:00:57,050
He's definitely going to notice this!   -Looking good

20
00:00:57,050 --> 00:00:58,880
Of course he's going to notice this!

21
00:00:58,880 --> 00:01:01,880
I really think it's perfectly done   -Seriously?

22
00:01:01,880 --> 00:01:02,930
He's gonna be thinking "huh?"

23
00:01:02,930 --> 00:01:05,650
And well, there're quite a lot of pranks today

24
00:01:05,650 --> 00:01:09,510
This is a fake one. I always use this

25
00:01:09,510 --> 00:01:11,510
It's actually empty

26
00:01:11,510 --> 00:01:12,900
And I'll use it like this...

27
00:01:14,270 --> 00:01:16,020
I'll be doing this very frequently

28
00:01:16,020 --> 00:01:17,620
Oh, so you'll do it for many times?

29
00:01:17,620 --> 00:01:19,340
Yes, I'll do it for many times

30
00:01:19,340 --> 00:01:20,700
And see when will he stop me

31
00:01:20,700 --> 00:01:22,340
"How many times did you use that, dude!"

32
00:01:22,340 --> 00:01:24,310
Tanaka prepared something too

33
00:01:24,310 --> 00:01:25,470
For me...

34
00:01:25,470 --> 00:01:28,070
Actually, under my jacket...

35
00:01:28,670 --> 00:01:29,930
I'm wearing this T-shirt

36
00:01:29,930 --> 00:01:31,460
This is the one before, right?

37
00:01:31,460 --> 00:01:33,490
This part is pixelated now   -Yes, mosaic

38
00:01:33,490 --> 00:01:38,440
This is the T-shirt from "The judgement of Hamada is getting older and older"

39
00:01:38,440 --> 00:01:40,570
And I'll showing it at some point in time

40
00:01:40,570 --> 00:01:41,150
I see

41
00:01:41,150 --> 00:01:46,450
This time, I'll pretend to have erection

42
00:01:46,450 --> 00:01:48,320
It's not erected now though   -Got it

43
00:01:48,320 --> 00:01:51,260
I'll make it look like it's erected after the show starts

44
00:01:51,260 --> 00:01:53,280
Okay, Hamada is entering very soon

45
00:01:53,280 --> 00:01:54,440
So let's get ready!

46
00:01:54,440 --> 00:01:55,330
Let's do it

47
00:02:04,350 --> 00:02:06,510
Getting ready to prank Hamada

48
00:02:07,620 --> 00:02:11,820
Waiting for Hamada to enter the studio as usual

49
00:02:12,950 --> 00:02:14,390
And then...

50
00:02:14,390 --> 00:02:15,760
Hamada is entering

51
00:02:15,760 --> 00:02:18,360
Please prepare the mic   -Nice to meet you

52
00:02:18,360 --> 00:02:21,670
Nice to meet you   -Nice to meet you

53
00:02:26,460 --> 00:02:28,160
Tanaka, do you know the rules today?

54
00:02:28,160 --> 00:02:30,340
Yes, no problem. No problem for today

55
00:02:30,340 --> 00:02:31,580
I'm confident

56
00:02:31,580 --> 00:02:33,220
Seriously, I'm gonna punch you, dude

57
00:02:33,220 --> 00:02:35,680
No, please don't punch me

58
00:02:35,680 --> 00:02:37,830
Generation gap?   -Exactly

59
00:02:39,720 --> 00:02:42,300
No problem, definitely no problem for today

60
00:02:42,300 --> 00:02:43,660
No worries

61
00:02:43,660 --> 00:02:47,100
Will Hamada notice it?

62
00:02:47,100 --> 00:02:49,940
Hamada-san, please read the title   -Got it

63
00:02:49,940 --> 00:02:51,390
Five seconds countdown

64
00:02:51,390 --> 00:02:53,820
Four, three, two...

65
00:02:53,820 --> 00:02:56,430
The 7th time on Gaki no Tsukai ya Arahende!

66
00:02:56,430 --> 00:02:59,420
Let's Play Tabletop Games from Around the World!

67
00:03:01,300 --> 00:03:03,970
The 7th time   -Yes, the 7th time now

68
00:03:03,970 --> 00:03:09,630
You have to know about the rules, there's nothing we can do about it

69
00:03:09,630 --> 00:03:12,650
Yes, of course, I've entered earlier and learnt the rules

70
00:03:12,650 --> 00:03:14,300
Let's have a look then?

71
00:03:14,300 --> 00:03:16,500
Let's see what kind of games are there

72
00:03:16,500 --> 00:03:18,950
Many of these games are German style

73
00:03:18,950 --> 00:03:21,150
And they are very interesting

74
00:03:22,140 --> 00:03:24,630
Easier ones are better   -You're right

75
00:03:24,630 --> 00:03:27,670
Don't make it complicated   -Yes, exactly

76
00:03:27,670 --> 00:03:29,630
Don't fool around with elderlies

77
00:03:29,630 --> 00:03:30,820
That's so true   -Yes, got it

78
00:03:30,820 --> 00:03:35,030
We simply want to enjoy the game together   -Yes

79
00:03:35,030 --> 00:03:36,750
To begin with

80
00:03:36,750 --> 00:03:38,180
Which one should we play first...

81
00:03:38,180 --> 00:03:40,400
You can decide it   -May I?

82
00:03:40,400 --> 00:03:41,510
Yeah, sure

83
00:03:41,510 --> 00:03:43,680
There're many different games here, but...

84
00:03:43,680 --> 00:03:45,780
How about starting with a German game?

85
00:03:45,780 --> 00:03:48,240
German game?   -Yes, let's start with a German game

86
00:03:49,840 --> 00:03:52,300
German games are interesting   -Yes, very interesting

87
00:03:52,300 --> 00:03:54,980
German games are regular, huh?

88
00:03:54,980 --> 00:03:56,240
Yes, it's a regular

89
00:03:57,100 --> 00:03:59,650
So let's play this game together   -Yes

90
00:03:59,650 --> 00:04:02,900
I'll explain the rules while playing

91
00:04:02,900 --> 00:04:07,390
5 cards are on the table

92
00:04:07,390 --> 00:04:13,140
Each person will have 4 cards on hand

93
00:04:13,140 --> 00:04:16,340
There are 5 cards on the table, right?   -Yes

94
00:04:16,340 --> 00:04:20,020
Please look at these cards carefully and memorize them

95
00:04:20,020 --> 00:04:21,010
Eh? Memorize them?

96
00:04:21,010 --> 00:04:23,400
Then I'll ask everyone to close their eyes

97
00:04:23,400 --> 00:04:25,640
And for example, for this card...

98
00:04:25,640 --> 00:04:29,260
The front side and the back side are slightly different

99
00:04:29,260 --> 00:04:31,040
Yeah, it is!   -I see

100
00:04:31,040 --> 00:04:33,840
Each card is slightly different on each side

101
00:04:33,840 --> 00:04:35,210
While everyone closes their eyes

102
00:04:35,210 --> 00:04:37,980
The host, which is me, will flip one of the card

103
00:04:37,980 --> 00:04:41,120
Ah, I see where this is going

104
00:04:41,120 --> 00:04:42,710
I hate this kind of games!

105
00:04:42,710 --> 00:04:45,730
We need to find out which card is flipped, right?   -Yes, exactly

106
00:04:45,730 --> 00:04:47,190
I see

107
00:04:47,190 --> 00:04:48,980
Aren't 5 cards too much?

108
00:04:48,980 --> 00:04:51,160
2 cards are enough

109
00:04:51,160 --> 00:04:54,030
No way, that's too easy

110
00:04:54,030 --> 00:04:56,690
Definitely not enough

111
00:04:56,690 --> 00:04:58,450
That would be too easy

112
00:04:58,450 --> 00:05:06,630
The first person to find out the flipped card, gets to put his card on the table

113
00:05:06,630 --> 00:05:11,130
And the person with no more cards on hand wins

114
00:05:11,130 --> 00:05:14,820
Since there will be more and more cards on the table

115
00:05:14,820 --> 00:05:17,130
It will become more and more difficult   -I see

116
00:05:17,130 --> 00:05:20,510
So, I'll be the host, and let's start the game

117
00:05:22,340 --> 00:05:24,250
Please memorize the cards now

118
00:05:25,540 --> 00:05:28,050
Maybe there're some traps, huh?

119
00:05:28,050 --> 00:05:30,990
We don't know which part of the card will be changed

120
00:05:32,570 --> 00:05:35,820
Time's up! Everyone, please close your eyes

121
00:05:35,820 --> 00:05:37,320
And I will...

122
00:05:37,320 --> 00:05:38,880
I don't remember them already

123
00:05:38,880 --> 00:05:40,880
The host must be having fun

124
00:05:41,820 --> 00:05:43,130
Okay, the card is flipped

125
00:05:43,130 --> 00:05:46,380
So everyone, please open your eyes

126
00:05:46,380 --> 00:05:49,050
Okay, please find out which card is different

127
00:05:50,130 --> 00:05:52,080
What is different for this card?

128
00:05:52,080 --> 00:05:54,400
I think the cow didn't have flowers in it's mouth before

129
00:05:54,400 --> 00:05:56,230
I think it was all grass before

130
00:05:56,230 --> 00:05:57,000
Correct!

131
00:06:00,610 --> 00:06:01,950
Amazing!   -Eh?!

132
00:06:01,950 --> 00:06:03,460
That's incredible!

133
00:06:03,460 --> 00:06:05,860
Seriously?!

134
00:06:05,860 --> 00:06:07,550
He's right!

135
00:06:09,140 --> 00:06:11,920
No way...   -Incredible!

136
00:06:11,920 --> 00:06:12,910
Absolutely incredible

137
00:06:12,910 --> 00:06:15,890
This is amazing, right?   -How did you even notice that?

138
00:06:16,270 --> 00:06:18,640
I had no idea   -Me too

139
00:06:21,660 --> 00:06:23,300
Incredible

140
00:06:23,300 --> 00:06:24,750
Matsumoto-san got it right

141
00:06:24,750 --> 00:06:29,640
So Matsumoto-san can put one of his card on the table

142
00:06:29,640 --> 00:06:30,480
This one?

143
00:06:30,480 --> 00:06:33,040
Sure, just put it on the table

144
00:06:33,930 --> 00:06:36,650
After Matsumoto-san added his card, there're more cards on the table now

145
00:06:42,380 --> 00:06:43,770
Hey...

146
00:06:44,690 --> 00:06:47,110
You did this to me again, huh?

147
00:06:47,110 --> 00:06:49,110
Eh? What?

148
00:06:49,110 --> 00:06:49,880
Huh?

149
00:06:49,880 --> 00:06:51,640
Eh? What do you mean?

150
00:06:51,640 --> 00:06:53,210
What the heck happened to that dude's chin?

151
00:06:58,950 --> 00:07:03,170
No, no, no...

152
00:07:03,170 --> 00:07:05,600
Phew, finally...

153
00:07:06,850 --> 00:07:11,270
Come on, let's play this properly

154
00:07:11,270 --> 00:07:13,570
However...

155
00:07:13,570 --> 00:07:15,570
Too late!!

156
00:07:15,570 --> 00:07:19,040
No one really looks at the face

157
00:07:19,040 --> 00:07:21,710
No way, of course we do

158
00:07:21,710 --> 00:07:24,830
I actually thought you'll notice it at the opening

159
00:07:24,830 --> 00:07:28,310
No, come on, I didn't even think about it

160
00:07:28,310 --> 00:07:30,890
It has been quite a while

161
00:07:30,890 --> 00:07:32,710
Come on, please do your job

162
00:07:32,710 --> 00:07:35,970
Honestly, I just simply wanted to enjoy the game

163
00:07:35,970 --> 00:07:38,170
Yeah, we want to enjoy the game too

164
00:07:38,170 --> 00:07:40,510
Let's do this properly!!

165
00:07:40,510 --> 00:07:43,960
Sorry, please forgive us   -Yeah, let's do it properly

166
00:07:43,960 --> 00:07:46,230
It's fine for me to continue like this, right?

167
00:07:46,230 --> 00:07:46,810
Yeah

168
00:07:46,810 --> 00:07:48,520
This game was really entertaining

169
00:07:48,520 --> 00:07:50,880
Yeah, I enjoyed this one too

170
00:07:50,880 --> 00:07:53,620
I thought it was incredible for him to get it right

171
00:07:54,700 --> 00:07:57,760
The stage is cleaned up and the game is restarted

172
00:07:58,620 --> 00:08:01,160
I didn't think about this at all

173
00:08:01,160 --> 00:08:03,890
No more pranks, seriously

174
00:08:05,390 --> 00:08:07,400
There are many interesting games today

175
00:08:07,400 --> 00:08:10,710
But Matsumoto-san is really good at this game, incredible

176
00:08:10,710 --> 00:08:13,530
I think you have to narrow down your target

177
00:08:13,530 --> 00:08:14,890
And only memorize a few

178
00:08:14,890 --> 00:08:15,840
That's a good strategy

179
00:08:15,840 --> 00:08:18,880
It's impossible to memorize all 5 cards

180
00:08:18,880 --> 00:08:21,000
Hamada-san, let's enjoy this game

181
00:08:21,000 --> 00:08:23,070
Yeah, of course

182
00:08:23,070 --> 00:08:25,510
Your face looks scary

183
00:08:25,510 --> 00:08:28,080
Let's just enjoy it

184
00:08:28,080 --> 00:08:32,230
Matsumoto-san won the game and put his card on the table

185
00:08:32,230 --> 00:08:33,730
So Matsumoto-san will be the host

186
00:08:33,730 --> 00:08:36,780
And we will close our eyes

187
00:08:36,780 --> 00:08:37,730
Memorize it first

188
00:08:37,730 --> 00:08:39,730
Three...

189
00:08:39,730 --> 00:08:41,610
Two...

190
00:08:41,610 --> 00:08:42,400
One...

191
00:08:42,400 --> 00:08:44,040
Okay, stop

192
00:08:45,630 --> 00:08:46,760
Okay

193
00:08:46,760 --> 00:08:48,700
Please open your eyes

194
00:08:51,880 --> 00:08:53,350
Eh? Seriously?   -Wait a second...

195
00:08:53,350 --> 00:08:54,380
Eh?

196
00:08:54,380 --> 00:08:55,360
Did anything change?

197
00:08:55,360 --> 00:08:56,810
Ah! I got it!

198
00:08:56,810 --> 00:08:58,840
Wait Endo, don't flip it yet

199
00:08:58,840 --> 00:09:00,460
Tell us the difference first

200
00:09:00,460 --> 00:09:02,460
Yes, tell us before you flip it

201
00:09:02,460 --> 00:09:03,470
What was changed?

202
00:09:03,470 --> 00:09:06,900
The dolphin was jumping before, and it's now facing down

203
00:09:08,110 --> 00:09:11,240
So it finished jumping   -Yes, after jumping

204
00:09:11,240 --> 00:09:13,710
Correct!

205
00:09:13,710 --> 00:09:15,710
Incredible!   -Really?

206
00:09:16,110 --> 00:09:17,750
Awesome, that was awesome

207
00:09:17,750 --> 00:09:20,410
So Endo, please put one card on the table

208
00:09:21,340 --> 00:09:22,710
I'll put this one

209
00:09:22,710 --> 00:09:25,280
Whao, they all look similar

210
00:09:25,280 --> 00:09:28,840
Oh, so this time Endo is the host   -Yes

211
00:09:28,840 --> 00:09:31,340
Okay, so please memorize them now

212
00:09:31,340 --> 00:09:33,620
Please take your time   -This is too difficult

213
00:09:33,620 --> 00:09:35,290
Five

214
00:09:35,290 --> 00:09:36,370
Four

215
00:09:36,370 --> 00:09:37,620
Three

216
00:09:37,620 --> 00:09:38,860
Two

217
00:09:38,860 --> 00:09:39,770
One

218
00:09:39,770 --> 00:09:41,030
Okay, time's up!

219
00:09:41,030 --> 00:09:43,330
Please close your eyes now

220
00:09:43,330 --> 00:09:44,320
Ready?

221
00:09:44,320 --> 00:09:46,780
Ah, I closed my eyes just now

222
00:09:46,780 --> 00:09:48,490
Me too

223
00:09:48,490 --> 00:09:50,580
Yeah, the way Endo said it...

224
00:09:50,580 --> 00:09:52,400
We have to look at it first, right?

225
00:09:52,400 --> 00:09:56,440
I thought there's another memorizing time afterwards

226
00:09:56,860 --> 00:09:58,590
Wait...don't you think it's too much?

227
00:10:01,430 --> 00:10:02,400
Here it comes

228
00:10:03,080 --> 00:10:04,830
Fabulous!   -I knew you could do it

229
00:10:04,830 --> 00:10:06,920
This is inappropriate, dude!!

230
00:10:07,930 --> 00:10:10,160
Why the heck are you squeezing it all the time?

231
00:10:11,160 --> 00:10:12,220
Good job!

232
00:10:12,220 --> 00:10:13,810
Very well done

233
00:10:13,810 --> 00:10:17,050
I didn't expect him to say "that's too much" though

234
00:10:17,050 --> 00:10:19,770
"That's too much"...

235
00:10:19,770 --> 00:10:23,400
Come on, you said you won't do it anymore

236
00:10:23,400 --> 00:10:25,350
Yes, let's stop it, no more

237
00:10:25,350 --> 00:10:27,660
Hamada is exhausted already   -Exactly!

238
00:10:27,660 --> 00:10:30,240
Yeah, he can't even enjoy the game

239
00:10:30,240 --> 00:10:31,660
He can't focus on the game

240
00:10:31,660 --> 00:10:32,880
Please, please, stop it

241
00:10:32,880 --> 00:10:36,060
Yes, of course, all of the staffs are here, right?

242
00:10:36,060 --> 00:10:37,960
Yeah, that's true

243
00:10:37,960 --> 00:10:39,960
He's distracted, right?

244
00:10:39,960 --> 00:10:41,900
Yeah, he can't focus on the game

245
00:10:41,900 --> 00:10:43,220
That's pathetic

246
00:10:43,220 --> 00:10:45,280
Okay, let's play this again

247
00:10:45,280 --> 00:10:46,970
Please memorize the cards

248
00:10:46,970 --> 00:10:48,970
No, no, no way   -What happened?

249
00:10:50,650 --> 00:10:52,320
There's a kid over there

250
00:10:54,230 --> 00:10:58,270
There's a kid mingling with the staffs

251
00:10:58,640 --> 00:11:01,370
That's too awkward

252
00:11:01,370 --> 00:11:03,370
Well done

253
00:11:03,370 --> 00:11:04,390
Very well done

254
00:11:04,390 --> 00:11:07,180
There's a kid over there?

255
00:11:07,180 --> 00:11:11,400
Why is the camera assistant a kid?

256
00:11:12,380 --> 00:11:15,240
He's here long time ago   -No way!

257
00:11:16,580 --> 00:11:18,540
Wasn't he?

258
00:11:18,540 --> 00:11:21,970
He's here like 8 months ago

259
00:11:21,970 --> 00:11:23,840
Yeah   -Exactly

260
00:11:23,840 --> 00:11:26,280
He said he's very interested in being a camera assistant

261
00:11:26,280 --> 00:11:28,460
Despite of being so young

262
00:11:28,460 --> 00:11:29,990
He's admirable   -No, no way...

263
00:11:29,990 --> 00:11:32,510
He's a primary school student!

264
00:11:33,840 --> 00:11:34,870
Primary school student...

265
00:11:34,870 --> 00:11:38,300
He was already laughing when he met Hamada's eyes

266
00:11:38,300 --> 00:11:40,570
He laughed?   -He completely laughed

267
00:11:43,340 --> 00:11:46,630
Okay, no more!   -Please stop it, please

268
00:11:46,630 --> 00:11:47,460
Let's cut it out

269
00:11:47,460 --> 00:11:48,490
Shall we play another game?

270
00:11:48,490 --> 00:11:49,370
Yeah, let's change it

271
00:11:49,370 --> 00:11:50,980
Change it as a change of pace

272
00:11:53,210 --> 00:11:59,220
The stage was tidied up, and the game was changed

273
00:11:59,330 --> 00:12:03,200
This is a German game called "Ride on the crocodile?"

274
00:12:03,200 --> 00:12:04,370
Crocodile?   -Yes

275
00:12:04,370 --> 00:12:08,000
Basically more and more animals will be placed on it

276
00:12:08,000 --> 00:12:09,910
But before that, roll the dice

277
00:12:09,910 --> 00:12:11,990
For example, if it's one, then put one on it

278
00:12:11,990 --> 00:12:13,850
If it's two, then put two on it

279
00:12:13,850 --> 00:12:16,710
Different numbers have different rules

280
00:12:16,710 --> 00:12:20,180
And I'll explain it while playing   -Got it

281
00:12:21,060 --> 00:12:24,330
What is the next prank to be played on Hamada?

282
00:12:25,100 --> 00:12:26,390
Rock, paper and scissors?

283
00:12:26,390 --> 00:12:27,800
Yeah, that's a good idea

284
00:12:27,800 --> 00:12:28,970
Rock, paper and scissors

285
00:12:28,970 --> 00:12:32,060
The game begins with Matsumoto's turn

286
00:12:32,060 --> 00:12:34,590
Please roll the dice and follow the rules

287
00:12:34,590 --> 00:12:36,590
I'll roll it now   -Yes

288
00:12:37,200 --> 00:12:38,100
Here it is

289
00:12:38,100 --> 00:12:38,900
You're lucky

290
00:12:38,900 --> 00:12:43,080
You can choose one of your animals

291
00:12:43,080 --> 00:12:44,790
And instead of putting it yourself

292
00:12:44,790 --> 00:12:47,080
You can ask someone else to put it for you

293
00:12:47,080 --> 00:12:50,430
Since you're not the one putting it, you don't need to worry even if it collapses

294
00:12:50,430 --> 00:12:52,280
So I don't need to do anything

295
00:12:52,280 --> 00:12:54,700
I'll give this to Hamada-san then

296
00:12:55,860 --> 00:12:57,470
This one   -The sheep

297
00:12:57,470 --> 00:12:59,470
Yeah, the sheep

298
00:13:02,460 --> 00:13:05,270
You can put it this way, or even the other way around

299
00:13:05,270 --> 00:13:06,520
Oh, I can put it this way?   -Yes

300
00:13:06,520 --> 00:13:08,520
So I can't control anything about that?   -Yes

301
00:13:08,520 --> 00:13:10,160
He can put it however he wants

302
00:13:10,160 --> 00:13:12,090
Is this fine?   -Yes

303
00:13:12,090 --> 00:13:15,520
I passed it to him too early   -Yes, that's true

304
00:13:15,520 --> 00:13:17,880
It's now Hosei-san's turn

305
00:13:19,150 --> 00:13:19,860
One

306
00:13:19,860 --> 00:13:21,890
For number one, you put one of your animal on it

307
00:13:21,890 --> 00:13:23,890
I'll put this snake...

308
00:13:25,400 --> 00:13:27,550
It looks shaky

309
00:13:27,550 --> 00:13:29,380
It's tilted!

310
00:13:29,380 --> 00:13:31,550
Eh? This is awful

311
00:13:31,550 --> 00:13:32,710
It's a bit tilted

312
00:13:32,710 --> 00:13:35,050
Well, we just have to continue

313
00:13:35,050 --> 00:13:37,050
Okay, Endo-san

314
00:13:39,380 --> 00:13:40,120
What is this?

315
00:13:40,120 --> 00:13:41,670
It's the crocodile!

316
00:13:41,670 --> 00:13:44,020
It's really good to have the crocodile

317
00:13:44,020 --> 00:13:46,760
If it's crocodile...   -It's even possible to get the crocodile?

318
00:13:46,760 --> 00:13:50,640
From the animals that you've got...

319
00:13:50,640 --> 00:13:52,920
Ahh...you said there's no more, right?

320
00:13:55,130 --> 00:13:57,050
Huh?   -From the animals that you've got...

321
00:13:57,490 --> 00:14:00,020
You said there's no more!

322
00:14:00,020 --> 00:14:02,020
Shozo is having an erection!

323
00:14:05,600 --> 00:14:07,810
Thank you very much   -What the heck, come on!

324
00:14:10,350 --> 00:14:12,350
Bravo!

325
00:14:12,350 --> 00:14:16,080
Well done

326
00:14:17,040 --> 00:14:19,340
Thank you very much, excuse me

327
00:14:19,900 --> 00:14:22,670
-It's a physiological phenomenon
-Yeah, it's inevitable

328
00:14:22,670 --> 00:14:24,880
I realized it as soon as he stood up

329
00:14:24,880 --> 00:14:25,950
I was looking over here

330
00:14:25,950 --> 00:14:28,780
But when he stood up, I was like "whaooo..."

331
00:14:28,780 --> 00:14:32,100
Really? Thank you very much

332
00:14:32,100 --> 00:14:34,480
Come on!

333
00:14:34,480 --> 00:14:36,260
Cut it out, Endo!   -Yes, please forgive me!

334
00:14:36,260 --> 00:14:37,660
We're recording now!   -I'm sorry

335
00:14:38,010 --> 00:14:39,890
What did you get?   -Crocodile

336
00:14:39,890 --> 00:14:41,370
If it's the crocodile

337
00:14:41,370 --> 00:14:45,850
You can put another animal beside, and it will become another base

338
00:14:45,850 --> 00:14:49,940
-And you can put it on the new base
-So the placable area becomes larger

339
00:14:49,940 --> 00:14:51,940
Better choose a flatter animal as base   -Yes

340
00:14:53,030 --> 00:14:54,930
Be careful though, don't break it

341
00:14:54,930 --> 00:14:56,480
Endo-san finished his turn

342
00:14:57,250 --> 00:14:59,950
It's then Hamada and Matsumoto's turns

343
00:14:59,950 --> 00:15:01,720
Hedgehog

344
00:15:04,860 --> 00:15:07,740
The animals are placed with ease

345
00:15:08,790 --> 00:15:10,070
Oh, one!

346
00:15:10,070 --> 00:15:14,180
He didn't even notice Tanaka's prank...

347
00:15:14,180 --> 00:15:16,200
The way you placed this is so annoying

348
00:15:17,280 --> 00:15:19,530
The game continues

349
00:15:19,530 --> 00:15:23,530
And it's now the 3rd round

350
00:15:23,530 --> 00:15:25,620
Roll the dice carefully

351
00:15:25,620 --> 00:15:28,220
It may even collapse because of the dice

352
00:15:28,220 --> 00:15:30,510
"Becoz" it will vibrate

353
00:15:30,510 --> 00:15:32,510
Becoz?

354
00:15:33,450 --> 00:15:36,420
That was a strange pronunciation   -"Becoz"

355
00:15:38,700 --> 00:15:39,310
Excuse me

356
00:15:39,310 --> 00:15:41,310
What was that? Was that relevant to the game?

357
00:15:41,310 --> 00:15:44,330
No, completely irrelevant, I'm sorry   -"Becoz"?

358
00:15:44,330 --> 00:15:48,560
Are you fooling with me, dude!   -Huh?

359
00:15:48,560 --> 00:15:51,050
That T-shirt!

360
00:15:53,180 --> 00:15:56,420
Finally...   -Finally!

361
00:15:56,420 --> 00:15:58,070
Come on!   -He finally noticed it

362
00:15:58,070 --> 00:16:01,280
I didn't notice it at all!

363
00:16:02,810 --> 00:16:05,790
Come on!   -Finally noticed it

364
00:16:06,780 --> 00:16:09,240
It took him quite long   -Yeah, that was long

365
00:16:09,240 --> 00:16:12,070
I didn't look at that at all

366
00:16:12,070 --> 00:16:12,860
You didn't look at this?

367
00:16:12,860 --> 00:16:17,300
We're doing this although we know it won't be aired!

368
00:16:17,300 --> 00:16:19,840
This part will all be pixelated

369
00:16:19,840 --> 00:16:23,630
Come on! I just suddenly saw that

370
00:16:23,630 --> 00:16:26,880
If Tanaka didn't say "becoz", it's gonna be awful

371
00:16:26,880 --> 00:16:27,640
Exactly   -Right?

372
00:16:27,640 --> 00:16:29,610
I see, so that's the turning point

373
00:16:29,610 --> 00:16:30,700
Did you say that on purpose?

374
00:16:30,700 --> 00:16:32,740
No, sorry for saying something weird

375
00:16:32,740 --> 00:16:36,350
You sound like Hamada Tsuyoshi saying "Becoz you bit my ear"

376
00:16:36,350 --> 00:16:39,610
Same pronunciation as "Tyson, becoz you bit my ear"

377
00:16:40,020 --> 00:16:41,150
Yeah, exactly, he did

378
00:16:41,150 --> 00:16:42,040
Excuse me

379
00:16:43,900 --> 00:16:47,830
The game continues, and it's now the 4th round

380
00:16:56,110 --> 00:16:58,500
Eh? I placed twice already

381
00:16:59,510 --> 00:17:02,800
-Yeah, that turns out to be the case
-But that's the rule, right?

382
00:17:02,800 --> 00:17:04,070
Yeah, it is

383
00:17:04,070 --> 00:17:05,710
But that looks quite possible

384
00:17:06,720 --> 00:17:08,230
Do it slowly

385
00:17:08,230 --> 00:17:11,330
"De De Demae-can, Demae ga sui sui suiii"

386
00:17:11,330 --> 00:17:13,310
"Warm, warm, delivered to you warmly!"

387
00:17:13,310 --> 00:17:15,460
"Demae ga sui sui suiii"

388
00:17:16,030 --> 00:17:17,560
"De De Demae-can"

389
00:17:17,560 --> 00:17:21,010
"Demae ga sui sui suiii"

390
00:17:28,560 --> 00:17:30,590
Stop the music!

391
00:17:32,090 --> 00:17:34,470
What the heck is going on?

392
00:17:34,880 --> 00:17:36,930
What the heck are you guys doing?

393
00:17:36,930 --> 00:17:38,930
Safe, safe

394
00:17:39,060 --> 00:17:40,660
Very impressive

395
00:17:40,880 --> 00:17:43,190
Very impressive   -Well done

396
00:17:43,190 --> 00:17:45,440
No, no, come on...   -Superb

397
00:17:45,440 --> 00:17:46,500
It really was superb

398
00:17:46,500 --> 00:17:49,250
The number of pranks is much more than before

399
00:17:49,250 --> 00:17:50,730
Is it?   -Yes

400
00:17:50,730 --> 00:17:54,480
But I have to say, you're not going senile at all!

401
00:17:54,480 --> 00:17:57,070
What does that even mean?

402
00:17:57,070 --> 00:17:58,770
You are well-honed

403
00:17:58,770 --> 00:18:00,060
Yeah, he noticed it quickly

404
00:18:00,060 --> 00:18:01,680
Are you taking something (drugs)?

405
00:18:01,680 --> 00:18:03,700
In order to be well-honed   -Thinking backwards

406
00:18:03,700 --> 00:18:05,720
What can I even take, dude

407
00:18:05,720 --> 00:18:07,790
His five senses are super sharp

408
00:18:07,790 --> 00:18:08,800
Nothing special

409
00:18:08,800 --> 00:18:09,680
Who's next?

410
00:18:09,680 --> 00:18:11,100
Yama-chan?

411
00:18:11,100 --> 00:18:15,360
Yes, Matsumoto-san just finished, so it's Hosei-san

412
00:18:17,760 --> 00:18:20,240
This is a tough one   -Very difficult

413
00:18:20,240 --> 00:18:22,240
Maybe it's gonna end here   -My turn?

414
00:18:22,630 --> 00:18:25,130
This one is really tough

415
00:18:25,130 --> 00:18:27,130
Please wait a moment...

416
00:18:27,130 --> 00:18:28,800
That's impossible

417
00:18:30,360 --> 00:18:32,380
You're boorish

418
00:18:32,380 --> 00:18:34,800
That's true, he's not cautious

419
00:18:34,800 --> 00:18:37,040
I wanted to have palpitation feeling

420
00:18:37,040 --> 00:18:38,300
It ended in one shot

421
00:18:38,300 --> 00:18:40,690
In this case, according to the rules

422
00:18:40,690 --> 00:18:42,440
From those that fell off

423
00:18:42,440 --> 00:18:45,980
Two of the animals will become yours

424
00:18:45,980 --> 00:18:49,550
And the other two are gone   -I see

425
00:18:49,550 --> 00:18:52,660
I see, these two, so the game continues?   -Yes, it continues

426
00:18:54,540 --> 00:19:00,520
After that, he didn't notice the prank at all, and it's now the 6th round

427
00:19:00,520 --> 00:19:01,700
Eh? You're facing the camera with your butt?

428
00:19:01,700 --> 00:19:03,720
Yeah, this is the crunch

429
00:19:03,720 --> 00:19:05,140
This is very crucial...

430
00:19:05,140 --> 00:19:09,220
Let's stand away from the table, just in case we hit it

431
00:19:09,220 --> 00:19:10,530
Would that ever happen?

432
00:19:14,840 --> 00:19:16,370
Amazing!

433
00:19:16,370 --> 00:19:18,370
He's really good at this   -So Matsumoto-san wins?

434
00:19:18,370 --> 00:19:19,910
Yes   -Congratulations

435
00:19:19,910 --> 00:19:21,020
Hooray!

436
00:19:21,020 --> 00:19:21,930
That was interesting

437
00:19:21,930 --> 00:19:23,250
Let's change the game

438
00:19:23,250 --> 00:19:25,250
Okay, got it

439
00:19:26,290 --> 00:19:26,870
Let's see

440
00:19:27,740 --> 00:19:30,240
Which game should we play...

441
00:19:30,240 --> 00:19:32,240
He scared me!

442
00:19:35,870 --> 00:19:37,790
Who the heck is he?

443
00:19:41,140 --> 00:19:44,230
Awesome   -He was frightened

444
00:19:46,070 --> 00:19:48,770
No, no, not "hooray"...

445
00:19:49,810 --> 00:19:51,910
Finally noticed it

446
00:19:52,960 --> 00:19:55,350
No, come on, seriously...

447
00:19:55,350 --> 00:19:57,110
Too much! Too much!!

448
00:19:58,300 --> 00:19:59,970
Finally noticed it

449
00:19:59,970 --> 00:20:02,990
He was there quite a while ago   -For real?

450
00:20:02,990 --> 00:20:06,310
I tried so hard to hold back my laughters

451
00:20:06,310 --> 00:20:08,640
I didn't notice him at all

452
00:20:09,460 --> 00:20:12,280
Okay, let's change the game

453
00:20:15,680 --> 00:20:19,720
Up till now, this is the third restart

454
00:20:20,410 --> 00:20:23,510
Is someone irrelevant mingling with the staffs?

455
00:20:23,600 --> 00:20:25,830
No, no, no more pranks

456
00:20:26,950 --> 00:20:28,460
Really?   -That's what they told me

457
00:20:29,700 --> 00:20:33,330
Hamada's cautiousness is at maximum

458
00:20:34,750 --> 00:20:37,700
And now, the new game starts

459
00:20:37,700 --> 00:20:39,700
This is a 5 player game

460
00:20:42,480 --> 00:20:44,460
Let's flip one card, for example this card...

461
00:20:44,460 --> 00:20:47,400
There are three kinds of color, right?

462
00:20:47,400 --> 00:20:52,670
You need to find out the Matryoshka card with all these 3 colors

463
00:20:52,670 --> 00:20:56,620
Then stand up and do the same pose as the card

464
00:20:56,620 --> 00:20:57,610
I see

465
00:20:57,610 --> 00:21:03,040
After all of the color cards are distributed, the person who got it right the most wins

466
00:21:03,040 --> 00:21:05,040
Got it   -That's all for the rules

467
00:21:05,040 --> 00:21:06,870
Let's start

468
00:21:06,870 --> 00:21:08,160
Okay

469
00:21:11,980 --> 00:21:14,820
Ah, this one is really hard to judge

470
00:21:14,820 --> 00:21:16,690
Yeah, very difficult to judge

471
00:21:16,690 --> 00:21:20,490
Whoa, wait a second, this one is so hard to judge, wait a second...

472
00:21:20,490 --> 00:21:23,590
Well, you know...

473
00:21:23,590 --> 00:21:27,730
People call me the legendary comedian

474
00:21:27,730 --> 00:21:29,880
Sorry, Endo wins   -Eh?!

475
00:21:29,880 --> 00:21:33,360
Sorry, that was difficult to judge, but I think he's a bit faster

476
00:21:33,360 --> 00:21:35,540
That one was difficult to judge   -Okay

477
00:21:36,630 --> 00:21:41,000
After that, he didn't notice the prank, and 8 minutes has passed

478
00:21:41,000 --> 00:21:43,000
I'll flip this one   -Okay

479
00:21:43,950 --> 00:21:47,490
Blue, yellow, red...

480
00:21:51,550 --> 00:21:54,060
Isn't it smelly?

481
00:21:58,620 --> 00:22:00,970
I knew it

482
00:22:00,970 --> 00:22:04,900
It's really hard for me to say though

483
00:22:04,900 --> 00:22:06,750
Glad that you said it

484
00:22:06,750 --> 00:22:09,630
Awesome

485
00:22:09,630 --> 00:22:12,680
Thank you very much

486
00:22:12,680 --> 00:22:16,700
It's actually smelly all the time

487
00:22:16,700 --> 00:22:21,820
The correct answer is, it smells like poop under the table

488
00:22:21,820 --> 00:22:22,720
It's the smell of poop

489
00:22:22,720 --> 00:22:24,220
Please don't think that it's body odor

490
00:22:24,220 --> 00:22:26,500
It was so freaking smelly

491
00:22:26,500 --> 00:22:27,960
It's the smell of poop

492
00:22:27,960 --> 00:22:30,750
We really wanted you to notice this as soon as possible

493
00:22:30,750 --> 00:22:31,780
I bet so

494
00:22:31,780 --> 00:22:34,300
Well, because there are people on both sides

495
00:22:34,300 --> 00:22:36,220
It's either Matsumoto or Endo

496
00:22:36,220 --> 00:22:39,410
But talking about body odor, it must be Matsumoto

497
00:22:39,410 --> 00:22:40,920
In terms of age

498
00:22:40,920 --> 00:22:44,960
I thought like "Matsumoto-san is already smelling like this?"

499
00:22:44,960 --> 00:22:46,700
So he's smelling like this recently?

500
00:22:46,700 --> 00:22:47,500
No way!

501
00:22:47,500 --> 00:22:49,040
That's so pathetic!

502
00:22:49,040 --> 00:22:51,220
It's actually the smell of poop though

503
00:22:51,220 --> 00:22:53,400
Anyway, this time...

504
00:22:53,400 --> 00:22:57,320
It ends here

505
00:22:57,710 --> 00:23:04,900
But actually, there's one more thing that we hoped you will notice

506
00:23:05,340 --> 00:23:11,970
But actually, there's one more thing that we hoped you will notice

507
00:23:11,970 --> 00:23:15,190
He's probably having a difficult time now

508
00:23:15,190 --> 00:23:16,580
A difficult time?

509
00:23:16,580 --> 00:23:20,420
This prank actually started right from the opening

510
00:23:20,420 --> 00:23:22,420
For about one hour already

511
00:23:22,800 --> 00:23:24,250
This one?

512
00:23:36,160 --> 00:23:37,500
Hello

513
00:23:39,510 --> 00:23:41,180
Please come out

514
00:23:44,240 --> 00:23:46,540
So you finally noticed me

515
00:23:46,650 --> 00:23:48,760
Why did you put Fujiwara inside?

516
00:23:50,140 --> 00:23:51,110
He left the hospital

517
00:23:51,110 --> 00:23:52,080
Ah, I see

518
00:23:52,080 --> 00:23:53,260
Do you feel well now?

519
00:23:53,260 --> 00:23:57,350
I thought I can finally stretch my body, but then they put me in this cramped place

520
00:23:57,350 --> 00:23:58,880
It must be cramped, huh?   -Yes
