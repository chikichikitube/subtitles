WDT Project

4
00:00:02,480 --> 00:00:06,150
Welcome everyone to Wednesday Downtown!

5
00:00:04,550 --> 00:00:06,150
Thanks for having us!

6
00:00:08,050 --> 00:00:11,160
Let's welcome our first presenter, come on in!

7
00:00:17,530 --> 00:00:20,900
Kannatsugi!!

8
00:00:18,000 --> 00:00:20,200
Thanks for having me!

9
00:00:20,900 --> 00:00:22,270
How unusual

10
00:00:22,270 --> 00:00:23,500
Yeah, a little bit weird

11
00:00:23,500 --> 00:00:27,310
He often appears in the video presentations

12
00:00:24,670 --> 00:00:27,310
I often appear in the videos in my disguise

13
00:00:27,310 --> 00:00:29,510
The style he's rocking

14
00:00:29,510 --> 00:00:31,810
and the clothes are weird

15
00:00:31,810 --> 00:00:34,410
I look weird? Should I then wear some uniform?

16
00:00:34,410 --> 00:00:37,450
Before presenting today's theory,

17
00:00:37,450 --> 00:00:39,020
I would like to ask a question to all of you

18
00:00:39,020 --> 00:00:41,390
Have you ever done a teacher's impression

19
00:00:41,390 --> 00:00:45,420
back when you were students?

20
00:00:45,420 --> 00:00:46,890
Yes, of course

21
00:00:45,690 --> 00:00:48,390
I think so, yes

22
00:00:46,890 --> 00:00:48,390
So, you have, right?

23
00:00:48,390 --> 00:00:52,600
I had this teacher who always spoke with her eyes half closed

24
00:00:51,560 --> 00:00:52,600
Half closed?

25
00:00:52,600 --> 00:00:55,370
She was a classical literature teacher,

26
00:00:55,370 --> 00:00:57,900
"The novel Taketori monogatari was..."

27
00:00:58,540 --> 00:01:01,840
Are you serious?

28
00:00:59,940 --> 00:01:01,840
I am!

29
00:01:01,840 --> 00:01:05,240
How can the teacher go like this?

30
00:01:04,310 --> 00:01:05,240
All the time!

31
00:01:05,240 --> 00:01:09,350
If right now someone from the same high school is watching, they're probably laughing

32
00:01:09,350 --> 00:01:12,020
That kind of teacher

33
00:01:12,020 --> 00:01:15,490
If we impersonated their gestures and habits

34
00:01:13,290 --> 00:01:14,420
Ah yes, yes

35
00:01:14,420 --> 00:01:15,320
I see

36
00:01:15,490 --> 00:01:17,220
It would be hilarious

37
00:01:17,220 --> 00:01:19,930
Since I'm a professional impersonator

38
00:01:19,930 --> 00:01:23,960
I started doing impressions of my teachers

39
00:01:22,530 --> 00:01:23,400
Your beginnings

40
00:01:23,700 --> 00:01:24,500
I see

41
00:01:24,000 --> 00:01:26,360
and everyone laughed with them

42
00:01:25,730 --> 00:01:26,360
Got you

43
00:01:26,360 --> 00:01:27,700
I became a professional

44
00:01:27,700 --> 00:01:29,330
So that's how you started

45
00:01:29,330 --> 00:01:32,940
And this is the theory I brought to you today:

46
00:01:33,670 --> 00:01:38,710
"If a professional impersonates real teachers, their students will die of laughter" theory

47
00:01:39,110 --> 00:01:39,880
Wooow

48
00:01:40,580 --> 00:01:42,080
That has to be funny

49
00:01:42,080 --> 00:01:47,590
If it's already funny when a regular student does it, imagine a professional!

50
00:01:44,050 --> 00:01:45,380
That's right

51
00:01:47,590 --> 00:01:49,890
It has to get laughs!

52
00:01:48,990 --> 00:01:49,890
I'm sure about that

53
00:01:49,890 --> 00:01:51,760
We're professionals after all!

54
00:01:51,960 --> 00:01:56,390
If you fail at that, you'd become useless, right?

55
00:01:54,890 --> 00:01:55,730
Hey!!

56
00:01:57,000 --> 00:02:00,770
Coming up next: professional impersonators try to take on teachers!

57
00:02:01,400 --> 00:02:03,440
Will they get tons of laughs?

58
00:02:05,040 --> 00:02:09,610
Also, "the stronger the tsukkomi, the funnier it gets" theory

59
00:02:13,580 --> 00:02:19,050
"People won't notice if a famous song with changed lyrics is played in a store" theory

60
00:02:19,450 --> 00:02:23,420
"You become powerless when holding a urine sample" theory

61
00:02:39,600 --> 00:02:45,240
"If a professional impersonates real teachers, their students will die of laughter" investigation

62
00:02:43,680 --> 00:02:45,240
Die of laughter...

63
00:02:45,580 --> 00:02:47,850
Today, we will visit Yamanashi,

64
00:02:47,850 --> 00:02:51,250
where FujiGakuen Middle School is located.

65
00:02:51,950 --> 00:02:54,020
They have a class per each school year

66
00:02:54,020 --> 00:02:58,620
and approximately 60 students enrolled

67
00:02:57,960 --> 00:02:59,820
Quite cozy in there!

68
00:02:59,020 --> 00:03:05,760
And these are the pros in charge of the teachers impressions!

69
00:03:01,230 --> 00:03:02,360
Amazing!

70
00:03:03,530 --> 00:03:06,100
That lineup is surely something!

71
00:03:06,500 --> 00:03:13,840
The pros visited the school in order to gather information about the teachers

72
00:03:15,670 --> 00:03:21,380
First, when inquiring some students who already graduated:

73
00:03:20,210 --> 00:03:22,080
Oh, I see

74
00:03:21,380 --> 00:03:23,680
There's this teacher, called Oomori sensei

75
00:03:23,680 --> 00:03:25,220
Oomori sensei

76
00:03:23,680 --> 00:03:25,220
Oomori sensei...

77
00:03:25,220 --> 00:03:27,020
What's his subject?

78
00:03:26,220 --> 00:03:27,020
Science

79
00:03:28,220 --> 00:03:29,850
When he gets mad, he gets like super agitated

80
00:03:30,560 --> 00:03:31,590
And goes like this

81
00:03:31,590 --> 00:03:33,390
All they way up, suddenly?

82
00:03:33,390 --> 00:03:35,630
That's right, his intonation too

83
00:03:34,930 --> 00:03:35,630
Oh, the intonation

84
00:03:35,630 --> 00:03:38,300
Could you do an impression of that?

85
00:03:39,400 --> 00:03:42,070
"Oh my, what are you doing??"

86
00:03:42,400 --> 00:03:43,800
"I have no heart, I'm telling you"

87
00:03:45,100 --> 00:03:47,170
This might work, I get it!

88
00:03:47,170 --> 00:03:49,640
He's always had a bad diction

89
00:03:48,270 --> 00:03:49,640
Bad diction?

90
00:03:49,640 --> 00:03:53,280
Since he has a bad diction, you can't understand him, huh?

91
00:03:53,880 --> 00:03:57,980
Next, the pros will watch the lessons live

92
00:03:58,580 --> 00:04:01,320
So you understand that "other" is singular, right?

93
00:04:01,650 --> 00:04:02,990
She raises the final "NE"

94
00:04:02,990 --> 00:04:05,790
She suddenly raises the final NE

95
00:04:03,560 --> 00:04:04,790
Amazing!

96
00:04:04,720 --> 00:04:05,790
The NE

97
00:04:05,790 --> 00:04:07,490
As if she were following a rhythm

98
00:04:06,420 --> 00:04:07,490
Right, a rhythm

99
00:04:07,490 --> 00:04:15,800
Oh, this guy

100
00:04:09,960 --> 00:04:11,660
Ah, this one

101
00:04:11,030 --> 00:04:12,430
His diction is unique

102
00:04:13,930 --> 00:04:15,800
Wow, look at the chalk

103
00:04:15,170 --> 00:04:17,040
This can be funny

104
00:04:15,800 --> 00:04:18,000
This might be possible, right?

105
00:04:17,240 --> 00:04:18,000
Yeah

106
00:04:18,500 --> 00:04:22,040
And then, regarding Oomori sensei:

107
00:04:24,840 --> 00:04:28,310
We can exaggerate this a little bit

108
00:04:26,140 --> 00:04:27,910
I see now

109
00:04:27,050 --> 00:04:28,310
That's right

110
00:04:28,750 --> 00:04:33,520
And now, Mr. "Slipping Glasses & Bad Diction" Oomori

111
00:04:34,090 --> 00:04:37,420
Has been chosen to be impersonated

112
00:04:37,760 --> 00:04:38,790
Also...

113
00:04:38,790 --> 00:04:39,320
Come in, please

114
00:04:39,320 --> 00:04:41,490
So, the teachers came too

115
00:04:40,930 --> 00:04:42,690
Hello!

116
00:04:43,530 --> 00:04:48,670
The pros will meet the teachers firsthand

117
00:04:48,670 --> 00:04:56,410
What impression do you think will make the students laugh?

118
00:04:56,410 --> 00:04:58,880
Well, I am bald so...

119
00:04:57,880 --> 00:04:58,880
Bald...

120
00:04:58,880 --> 00:05:01,080
I'd emphasize that

121
00:04:59,710 --> 00:05:01,080
I see

122
00:05:01,080 --> 00:05:03,620
So you've actually made fun of it before

123
00:05:02,110 --> 00:05:03,620
That's correct

124
00:05:03,620 --> 00:05:07,020
So, more precisely, how could we play with that?

125
00:05:07,020 --> 00:05:08,620
When I enter the classroom

126
00:05:08,620 --> 00:05:12,060
I go like "How's everyone?"

127
00:05:12,060 --> 00:05:13,890
It also makes a nice sound

128
00:05:13,890 --> 00:05:16,800
Now, you seem to be a really serious teacher

129
00:05:17,700 --> 00:05:19,800
Do you ever laugh out loud?

130
00:05:19,800 --> 00:05:21,500
Well, not really...

131
00:05:21,970 --> 00:05:25,900
What's the funniest thing you last laughed with?

132
00:05:31,840 --> 00:05:37,920
And with that, Oota sensei, who can't remember the last time he laughed,

133
00:05:37,920 --> 00:05:40,950
has also been selected to be impersonated!

134
00:05:41,750 --> 00:05:44,220
And now...

135
00:05:42,850 --> 00:05:44,220
Hello!

136
00:05:44,420 --> 00:05:47,630
Kanekatsu sensei...

137
00:05:47,630 --> 00:05:49,860
you have the "nice, nice!" catchphrase, right?

138
00:05:49,860 --> 00:05:53,800
When a student is doing well, I say like "nice, nice!"

139
00:05:53,800 --> 00:05:56,630
"Nice, nice!". Oh, I think we can use this

140
00:05:56,630 --> 00:05:58,940
Kanekatsu-sensei, and what about your dentures?

141
00:05:58,940 --> 00:06:00,940
Well, whenever I start shouting...

142
00:06:02,870 --> 00:06:04,240
Oh, wow

143
00:06:05,040 --> 00:06:08,050
This is so good

144
00:06:06,780 --> 00:06:08,050
That is funny

145
00:06:08,680 --> 00:06:14,790
After gathering all the information about the teachers, the pros went back to TBS

146
00:06:15,550 --> 00:06:21,360
They joined the other two pros who didn't participated before and held a meeting

147
00:06:22,030 --> 00:06:23,760
What should we do?

148
00:06:23,760 --> 00:06:26,200
Shall we decide who has to wear make up?

149
00:06:26,200 --> 00:06:29,400
Let's see first...

150
00:06:30,670 --> 00:06:32,700
who can get the main roles

151
00:06:31,640 --> 00:06:32,700
Right

152
00:06:32,700 --> 00:06:35,010
That looks so hard

153
00:06:35,570 --> 00:06:40,850
Depending on the looks, voice tone and such, each pro was assigned a teacher

154
00:06:42,080 --> 00:06:48,620
Kannatsuki will impersonate the eccentric Yamaguchi sensei, ex- member of a "poop seminar"

155
00:06:49,520 --> 00:06:54,560
Also, "bad diction" Oomori sensei, will be impersonated by Hori

156
00:06:55,190 --> 00:07:01,070
Mira will impersonate Ebara sensei, who can't stop saying "Who can try?"

157
00:07:01,830 --> 00:07:07,710
The serious but also good at dancing Oota sensei will be impersonated by Ehara

158
00:07:08,540 --> 00:07:14,980
And Mirakuru will be in charge of Nakayama sensei, who hisses after finishing her sentences

159
00:07:15,680 --> 00:07:23,350
"Denture" Kanekatsu sensei and "Bald gag" Okuwaki sensei will also appear during the show

160
00:07:23,690 --> 00:07:24,890
Looks like a medley

161
00:07:24,220 --> 00:07:28,060
After deciding the roles, they start preparing the content

162
00:07:26,990 --> 00:07:28,490
So exciting!

163
00:07:28,230 --> 00:07:34,170
I would like it to be realistic, like when I did it as a student

164
00:07:34,170 --> 00:07:37,300
Ah, staying true to the character, right?

165
00:07:37,300 --> 00:07:42,170
I'd like us to do our best without distorting the characters too much

166
00:07:41,340 --> 00:07:42,170
Right, right

167
00:07:42,170 --> 00:07:46,880
Since his personality is so strong, he should appear at the end

168
00:07:44,980 --> 00:07:46,880
I agree

169
00:07:45,610 --> 00:07:46,880
Yeah, after a while

170
00:07:46,880 --> 00:07:50,080
And how should we introduce the teacher's catchphrases?

171
00:07:50,080 --> 00:07:56,320
When Mirakuru appears, she would go like "suuuh",

172
00:07:56,320 --> 00:07:58,190
and a fart cushion will be heard in the back

173
00:07:59,520 --> 00:08:02,160
But wouldn't the catchphrase lose power?

174
00:08:02,490 --> 00:08:04,360
I've never prepared anything like this

175
00:08:03,660 --> 00:08:04,360
I know, right?

176
00:08:04,360 --> 00:08:05,830
Our first time...

177
00:08:06,260 --> 00:08:07,700
It's so tough!

178
00:08:06,260 --> 00:08:11,770
In order to "To make the students die of laughter",

179
00:08:12,400 --> 00:08:16,170
They are serious about it and the preparation goes on until late at night

180
00:08:16,880 --> 00:08:19,140
On the next day...

181
00:08:19,810 --> 00:08:22,150
They get together once more and start rehearsing

182
00:08:22,780 --> 00:08:25,350
They keep improving the content's quality

183
00:08:26,320 --> 00:08:30,150
And they finally wrapped it up!

184
00:08:30,150 --> 00:08:31,920
If they went like "woow",

185
00:08:31,920 --> 00:08:33,020
That would be terrible

186
00:08:33,020 --> 00:08:35,330
The reaction that impersonators hate the most

187
00:08:35,330 --> 00:08:36,900
Like "Ooooh"...

188
00:08:36,460 --> 00:08:38,560
If they don't laugh, right?

189
00:08:37,800 --> 00:08:39,730
Let's make them not go "oooh"

190
00:08:39,730 --> 00:08:41,030
Let's make them have fun

191
00:08:45,470 --> 00:08:51,180
The clueless students are gathered in the multi-purpose hall

192
00:08:51,510 --> 00:08:53,580
These days you've all been slacking off!

193
00:08:53,850 --> 00:08:56,510
That is why you're all here

194
00:08:56,780 --> 00:08:59,580
There's a teacher that has something to say to all of you

195
00:09:00,390 --> 00:09:02,350
We've had it with you guys!

196
00:09:02,720 --> 00:09:09,560
The students, after being fooled to believe they were being scolded, will meet the impersonators!

197
00:09:10,190 --> 00:09:12,300
I want every teacher

198
00:09:12,300 --> 00:09:13,870
to have a few words

199
00:09:13,870 --> 00:09:16,470
with all of you here

200
00:09:16,470 --> 00:09:18,770
You can cut the air with a knife

201
00:09:26,910 --> 00:09:28,180
Hello

202
00:09:28,780 --> 00:09:34,490
After the unexpected appearance, they still don't know what happened

203
00:09:33,450 --> 00:09:36,120
It was like: "what's going on?"

204
00:09:34,790 --> 00:09:38,390
Wait, this guy looks a lot like me!

205
00:09:38,690 --> 00:09:40,330
Who are you?

206
00:09:39,460 --> 00:09:40,330
No, who are YOU?

207
00:09:40,330 --> 00:09:42,290
I'm Yamaguchi!

208
00:09:41,390 --> 00:09:42,290
I AM Yamaguchi

209
00:09:42,290 --> 00:09:43,460
No, I'M YAMAGUCHI

210
00:09:43,460 --> 00:09:45,060
I'm Yamaguchi

211
00:09:45,060 --> 00:09:49,130
If you really are Yamaguchi, tell me. You were in a seminar back in college, right?

212
00:09:49,130 --> 00:09:50,270
Which seminar?

213
00:09:50,270 --> 00:09:52,370
Turd seminar

214
00:09:50,740 --> 00:09:52,370
A turd seminar!

215
00:09:53,040 --> 00:09:54,510
They're laughing a lot!

216
00:09:54,910 --> 00:09:57,810
The real Yamaguchi has eaten bugs right? Which insect did you eat?

217
00:09:57,810 --> 00:09:59,380
A stink bug

218
00:09:58,310 --> 00:09:59,380
A stink bug!!

219
00:09:59,700 --> 00:10:04,820
After realizing what's going on... they burst out laughing

220
00:10:04,520 --> 00:10:06,460
They find it hilarious

221
00:10:05,280 --> 00:10:06,320
And then...

222
00:10:06,650 --> 00:10:11,620
There are many other teachers that are also angry!

223
00:10:11,620 --> 00:10:12,920
Oomori sensei!

224
00:10:18,800 --> 00:10:20,920
The resemblance is amazing

225
00:10:18,800 --> 00:10:22,580
They achieved an amazing resemblance

226
00:10:23,480 --> 00:10:25,760
One, two, three

227
00:10:25,760 --> 00:10:28,140
Why the pinky, sensei?

228
00:10:28,320 --> 00:10:34,120
So, I want you to remember the important things needed for a flower to blossom

229
00:10:34,120 --> 00:10:35,920
There's one, two and three of them

230
00:10:35,910 --> 00:10:39,160
Hey, sensei, that's weird... It's pretty strange

231
00:10:39,720 --> 00:10:43,580
Stamen and pistil... Please remember that...

232
00:10:44,540 --> 00:10:46,540
Remember that!!!

233
00:10:46,840 --> 00:10:48,680
Remember that, I mean it!

234
00:10:48,900 --> 00:10:51,680
You can remember it!

235
00:10:49,680 --> 00:10:51,660
They find it hilarious!

236
00:10:51,680 --> 00:10:52,640
Sensei

237
00:10:52,630 --> 00:10:53,860
You all...

238
00:10:54,730 --> 00:10:56,530
Your diction is terrible, so we have no idea what you're saying

239
00:10:56,530 --> 00:10:58,370
My dihsshion?

240
00:10:58,370 --> 00:11:00,200
We have no idea what you say when you get mad

241
00:11:00,640 --> 00:11:04,440
Isn't there a teacher with a better diction in this school?

242
00:11:08,580 --> 00:11:11,980
WOW, WOW

243
00:11:09,800 --> 00:11:11,420
They're going "WOW"

244
00:11:12,100 --> 00:11:13,200
Hi everyone

245
00:11:15,240 --> 00:11:16,880
They really look alike

246
00:11:16,200 --> 00:11:19,990
So the other day we left it at page twentyfiiiiiiive

247
00:11:20,000 --> 00:11:22,340
We will continuuuuue...

248
00:11:26,440 --> 00:11:28,300
Like a one line joke

249
00:11:27,880 --> 00:11:29,540
They're laughing like hell!

250
00:11:28,920 --> 00:11:30,600
They really are

251
00:11:30,560 --> 00:11:32,740
When comparing "the other"

252
00:11:33,260 --> 00:11:34,860
They're laughing their heads off

253
00:11:36,100 --> 00:11:38,180
When comparing "the other" to..

254
00:11:38,180 --> 00:11:40,060
... "the othersssh"

255
00:11:42,560 --> 00:11:44,240
And then...

256
00:11:48,600 --> 00:11:50,060
He appeared

257
00:11:50,760 --> 00:11:55,140
They started laughing right after the entrance

258
00:11:56,500 --> 00:11:58,620
What about the real person?

259
00:12:02,040 --> 00:12:05,140
In spite of the circumstances, he remains expressionless

260
00:12:05,180 --> 00:12:06,880
What the hell!

261
00:12:06,900 --> 00:12:08,640
He's never laughed in his life

262
00:12:13,640 --> 00:12:15,710
They're the same!

263
00:12:16,340 --> 00:12:19,640
What's with your right hand, sensei?

264
00:12:19,800 --> 00:12:23,680
Your right hand!

265
00:12:24,460 --> 00:12:27,360
And your mouth? That's a duck face

266
00:12:28,090 --> 00:12:29,530
The contrast is hilarious

267
00:12:29,830 --> 00:12:31,260
I'll dance now

268
00:12:37,100 --> 00:12:40,060
Apparently he dances for the school festival

269
00:12:37,480 --> 00:12:40,400
And the last one to make entrance is...

270
00:12:45,840 --> 00:12:49,150
They're really similar

271
00:12:47,680 --> 00:12:49,100
Indeed

272
00:12:49,150 --> 00:12:54,500
Today I'd like to talk about my favourite team: Nippon Ham

273
00:12:55,200 --> 00:12:56,500
Ssss...

274
00:13:03,720 --> 00:13:05,660
Dot, dot...

275
00:13:05,830 --> 00:13:08,500
That's a lot of dots!! Too many of them!

276
00:13:08,500 --> 00:13:09,680
Dot dot dotdotdotdot...

277
00:13:14,870 --> 00:13:17,070
Ssssss

278
00:13:20,800 --> 00:13:22,740
Who should we call next?

279
00:13:24,320 --> 00:13:26,480
Should we bring Okuwaki sensei?

280
00:13:29,050 --> 00:13:31,960
It's Baldiewaki!

281
00:13:32,340 --> 00:13:36,780
And finally they will go for Kanekatsu sensei's motto: "Nice, nice!"

282
00:13:37,480 --> 00:13:39,200
What do you think about the whole show?

283
00:13:39,880 --> 00:13:41,680
It was... "nice, nice"!

284
00:13:42,400 --> 00:13:43,760
"Nice, nice!"

285
00:13:45,080 --> 00:13:46,620
I'm better at nicenicing!!

286
00:13:46,620 --> 00:13:47,720
It's obvious I'm better!

287
00:13:47,420 --> 00:13:48,700
I AM BETTER

288
00:13:48,700 --> 00:13:50,360
I'm "nice,nice"!

289
00:13:54,460 --> 00:13:56,700
Someone should decide who's the "nice, nicest"

290
00:13:57,260 --> 00:13:58,880
Hey you, come here

291
00:14:02,300 --> 00:14:04,620
Sensei, how was our impersonations?

292
00:14:05,620 --> 00:14:06,760
"Nice, nice"!!

293
00:14:09,980 --> 00:14:11,700
Thank you so much

294
00:14:13,380 --> 00:14:18,080
And like that, the impersonation show achieves a huge success!

295
00:14:18,470 --> 00:14:19,640
Were you surprised at the beginning?

296
00:14:20,940 --> 00:14:23,100
You might've thought "What's going on?" or something

297
00:14:23,470 --> 00:14:25,240
Who was the closest to the original?

298
00:14:25,310 --> 00:14:27,310
Oota sensei

299
00:14:29,900 --> 00:14:31,180
And...

300
00:14:31,250 --> 00:14:33,150
He's crying!

301
00:14:34,190 --> 00:14:37,460
Why are you crying?

302
00:14:35,820 --> 00:14:37,420
They're dying from laughter

303
00:14:39,420 --> 00:14:41,190
They're literally dying from laughter

304
00:14:41,290 --> 00:14:43,430
I don't know...

305
00:14:43,430 --> 00:14:45,200
Is it because you're happy?

306
00:14:48,200 --> 00:14:49,770
Why??

307
00:14:50,030 --> 00:14:51,540
I don't really know

308
00:14:51,540 --> 00:14:53,500
Is it that you are overflowed with joy?

309
00:14:54,410 --> 00:14:58,880
I think he's just overflowed with joy

310
00:14:59,080 --> 00:15:00,880
The funniest thing was that

311
00:15:01,010 --> 00:15:03,150
Nakayama sensei's impersonation was on point

312
00:15:03,160 --> 00:15:04,420
And Egara sensei too

313
00:15:04,650 --> 00:15:07,120
They really got her essence

314
00:15:07,120 --> 00:15:10,220
It was so funny that I'll probably won't be able to stop laughing during the next class

315
00:15:08,980 --> 00:15:10,340
I know, right?

316
00:15:10,340 --> 00:15:11,900
They'll sure laugh during the next class

317
00:15:10,450 --> 00:15:12,920
It's the funniest thing I've ever seen

318
00:15:14,260 --> 00:15:16,490
It was really moving...

319
00:15:16,690 --> 00:15:19,600
Don't you feel like really we accomplished?

320
00:15:18,100 --> 00:15:19,600
Yes, I really do

321
00:15:19,600 --> 00:15:20,330
First time feeling like this

322
00:15:20,330 --> 00:15:22,170
The best in 10 years

323
00:15:22,170 --> 00:15:24,070
I think we did really well

324
00:15:24,840 --> 00:15:26,000
Students

325
00:15:26,180 --> 00:15:27,180
Teachers

326
00:15:27,360 --> 00:15:28,340
And also

327
00:15:28,780 --> 00:15:30,460
The impersonators

328
00:15:30,840 --> 00:15:34,180
Everyone was filled with joy and laughter

329
00:15:34,780 --> 00:15:37,240
It surely was a great day

330
00:15:37,840 --> 00:15:42,840
In a few words: it was an unexpectedly a heart-warming show

331
00:15:44,300 --> 00:15:45,460
That was something

332
00:15:45,460 --> 00:15:47,760
They found it hilarious didn't they

333
00:15:47,760 --> 00:15:49,200
Even one student was crying in the end

334
00:15:49,190 --> 00:15:50,720
He actually was

335
00:15:50,820 --> 00:15:53,800
He was crying so much that his hands were SOAKED

336
00:15:53,800 --> 00:15:56,480
The back of his hand was soaked

337
00:15:57,000 --> 00:15:58,540
Is that really possible?

338
00:15:58,680 --> 00:16:01,100
They were confused in the beginning

339
00:16:01,100 --> 00:16:05,480
Yeah, that's right

340
00:16:02,200 --> 00:16:05,480
Right, the atmosphere was quite intense

341
00:16:05,540 --> 00:16:10,580
Can't you participate in school festivals or something?

342
00:16:11,020 --> 00:16:13,920
In schools, companies, and such...

343
00:16:14,040 --> 00:16:15,920
I see...

344
00:16:16,120 --> 00:16:19,620
It seems you can do it in another occasion

345
00:16:17,720 --> 00:16:19,620
I'd like to see it again!

346
00:16:19,680 --> 00:16:23,090
But the preparation is difficult as HELL

347
00:16:23,090 --> 00:16:28,500
It's good to have such a moving show, since the BPO is after us

348
00:16:26,680 --> 00:16:27,860
HEY

349
00:16:28,500 --> 00:16:29,860
They're not after us

350
00:16:31,900 --> 00:16:35,000
OK, let's continue! Here comes our next presenter!

351
00:16:39,920 --> 00:16:41,560
Hellooo

352
00:16:42,300 --> 00:16:45,850
It's Kaminari!!

353
00:16:42,400 --> 00:16:43,780
Hello!

354
00:16:44,560 --> 00:16:45,860
Hello!

355
00:16:46,300 --> 00:16:50,060
It's our first appearance so let us introduce ourselves

356
00:16:50,060 --> 00:16:52,700
My name is Takumi Ishida, member of Kaminari

357
00:16:54,700 --> 00:16:58,080
I'm Manabu Takeuchi, member of Kaminari

358
00:16:58,580 --> 00:17:01,500
You were supposed to say something stupid!!

359
00:17:06,080 --> 00:17:07,780
I can't help but hitting him

360
00:17:08,040 --> 00:17:10,710
It's amazing to watch it live

361
00:17:10,710 --> 00:17:14,200
Thank you. We usually do the hardcore tsukkomi

362
00:17:14,200 --> 00:17:16,880
This is the theory we brought!

363
00:17:17,560 --> 00:17:21,290
The stronger the tsukkomi, the funnier it gets "theory"

364
00:17:23,350 --> 00:17:26,690
I'm not really sure about that

365
00:17:26,900 --> 00:17:29,440
You get it, right, Hamada? After all, you're the founding father

366
00:17:29,520 --> 00:17:31,400
The hardcore tsukkomi founder

367
00:17:31,400 --> 00:17:35,620
But "the stronger the funnier..." part... It depends on the circumstances

368
00:17:36,800 --> 00:17:40,460
Not long ago, on a different show,

369
00:17:40,460 --> 00:17:45,200
when you guys, Kaminari, appeared there

370
00:17:45,640 --> 00:17:48,500
You weren't hitting very hard, right?

371
00:17:49,360 --> 00:17:50,360
The NHK one?

372
00:17:52,100 --> 00:17:56,740
In the NHK case, during the morning assembly they told us: "Hitting is forbidden"

373
00:17:57,300 --> 00:17:59,460
Why? What happened?

374
00:17:59,460 --> 00:18:05,020
It seems that since it's an educational TV they told us not to use violence

375
00:18:05,020 --> 00:18:07,200
Then why would they call you?

376
00:18:08,740 --> 00:18:13,240
If it's ok not getting hit, I'd like to appear on that show too

377
00:18:28,380 --> 00:18:32,960
"The stronger the tsukkomi, the funnier it gets" theory

378
00:18:33,660 --> 00:18:38,080
In this occasion, they'll use as a base their representative "senryuu" manzai

379
00:18:38,800 --> 00:18:43,520
They introduced their manzai to people who might be good at "strong tsukkomi"

380
00:18:44,400 --> 00:18:47,300
This is the structure of their "senryuu" manzai

381
00:18:47,560 --> 00:18:49,610
Give me one about "glasses"

382
00:18:48,480 --> 00:18:49,620
I got it already

383
00:18:49,720 --> 00:18:53,680
"While actually wearing them; I looked for them all confused around; where the hell are the glasses"

384
00:18:53,680 --> 00:18:54,880
Ah, quite funny indeed

385
00:18:54,880 --> 00:18:58,520
You had the glasses on the forehead the whole time you were looking for them

386
00:18:58,520 --> 00:19:00,180
Right

387
00:18:58,880 --> 00:19:00,200
It's actually quite funny

388
00:19:00,180 --> 00:19:01,190
I know, right? I'm good at senryuu

389
00:19:01,190 --> 00:19:02,880
That was really something

390
00:19:04,000 --> 00:19:07,940
By the way, That wasn't 5-7-5. That was 7-9-7!!!

391
00:19:08,800 --> 00:19:12,140
1. Takumi introduces the senryuu topic

392
00:19:12,560 --> 00:19:14,980
2. Manabu says something stupid as an answer

393
00:19:15,700 --> 00:19:21,660
3. After playing along for a while, Takumi calls him out (Tsukkomi)

394
00:19:22,340 --> 00:19:25,200
For the second half, the situation is changed

395
00:19:25,580 --> 00:19:27,780
How about you try reciting one?

396
00:19:27,960 --> 00:19:30,440
Ok, say a topic and I will give you one

397
00:19:30,450 --> 00:19:31,640
Alright: "Motherly love"

398
00:19:31,740 --> 00:19:33,200
"Motherly love":

399
00:19:33,840 --> 00:19:35,980
"Breakfast..."

400
00:19:37,260 --> 00:19:39,420
"Rebellious age"

401
00:19:40,300 --> 00:19:42,580
"Working night shifts"

402
00:19:44,080 --> 00:19:46,720
I'm quite bad at senryuus!

403
00:19:48,080 --> 00:19:52,940
They will use this senryuu manzai base for the theory

404
00:19:53,500 --> 00:19:58,580
But, "the stronger the tsukkomi, the funnier"... Is it true?

405
00:20:00,440 --> 00:20:01,450
He hits pretty strong

406
00:20:00,950 --> 00:20:02,480
Doesn't he?

407
00:20:01,580 --> 00:20:03,680
The first challenger is..

408
00:20:04,010 --> 00:20:04,820
Glad to have you

409
00:20:04,820 --> 00:20:06,950
Glad to be here

410
00:20:05,450 --> 00:20:06,950
Glad to be here

411
00:20:07,420 --> 00:20:08,420
Strong start

412
00:20:07,420 --> 00:20:12,960
Professional Wrestlers: The combination of Super Sasadango Machine & Kota Ibushi

413
00:20:09,750 --> 00:20:11,260
Oh, they appear here?

414
00:20:11,520 --> 00:20:13,660
This program sure likes Sasadango

415
00:20:13,420 --> 00:20:15,230
The Boke will be played by Sasadango

416
00:20:16,160 --> 00:20:23,070
The Tsukkomi will be played by Ibushi who is a man of many skills such as his flying kicks

417
00:20:23,970 --> 00:20:27,610
They'll quickly learn the way of Manzai comedy from Kaminari

418
00:20:28,170 --> 00:20:30,770
Now that you say that, there were too many characters.

419
00:20:30,770 --> 00:20:32,740
Well, something like that

420
00:20:32,740 --> 00:20:38,720
Here on the right side surface. This is the best spot. This place makes the best sound when hit.

421
00:20:34,310 --> 00:20:35,750
Ah, I see, I see

422
00:20:37,450 --> 00:20:39,950
It doesn't matter how you hit them

423
00:20:38,720 --> 00:20:39,650
Just like that.

424
00:20:39,650 --> 00:20:40,680
AH! SORRY!

425
00:20:41,490 --> 00:20:46,620
After that, what kind of retort will a Professional Wrestler combination do?

426
00:20:41,920 --> 00:20:43,250
That was expected

427
00:20:51,800 --> 00:20:55,600
Hello, we are Professional Wrestlers. Nice to meet you.

428
00:20:51,860 --> 00:20:53,030
That was cool

429
00:20:55,600 --> 00:20:57,840
So, truth be told

430
00:20:58,240 --> 00:21:01,110
I've noticed I'm actually better at Senryu poetry than I am at Wrestling

431
00:21:01,510 --> 00:21:04,680
So, for one, let's try the Champion Belt

432
00:21:04,680 --> 00:21:06,340
Champion Belt? Let's see..

433
00:21:06,340 --> 00:21:07,580
I got it!

434
00:21:07,140 --> 00:21:07,580
Yes?

435
00:21:08,950 --> 00:21:10,510
I forgot

436
00:21:10,510 --> 00:21:12,750
I was wearing the Champion Belt

437
00:21:12,750 --> 00:21:15,020
..and I cut my hand on the sharp part

438
00:21:15,320 --> 00:21:17,820
That was quite interesting

439
00:21:16,550 --> 00:21:17,820
Thank you

440
00:21:17,820 --> 00:21:18,960
The belt

441
00:21:18,660 --> 00:21:18,960
Yes

442
00:21:18,960 --> 00:21:21,860
the center is sharp, isn't it?

443
00:21:20,620 --> 00:21:21,360
Quite

444
00:21:21,860 --> 00:21:24,530
Something like that would usually happen

445
00:21:23,260 --> 00:21:23,890
Indeed

446
00:21:29,500 --> 00:21:33,200
Now that you say that, there were too many characters.

447
00:21:30,700 --> 00:21:32,200
That was one too many

448
00:21:33,300 --> 00:21:34,970
That was two hits!

449
00:21:34,310 --> 00:21:35,670
Next up

450
00:21:35,970 --> 00:21:36,670
The referee

451
00:21:36,670 --> 00:21:38,980
Referee

452
00:21:38,140 --> 00:21:38,980
I got it!

453
00:21:39,540 --> 00:21:42,310
A job that you hit the floor

454
00:21:42,710 --> 00:21:44,320
About the referee, right?

455
00:21:43,480 --> 00:21:43,850
Yes, about his job

456
00:21:44,750 --> 00:21:46,850
You did it again

457
00:21:46,850 --> 00:21:48,950
Well that's how it is

458
00:21:52,290 --> 00:21:56,090
But this time, you were too short!

459
00:21:57,430 --> 00:21:58,560
Next one

460
00:21:59,230 --> 00:22:00,030
The rope

461
00:22:01,330 --> 00:22:02,870
I got one!

462
00:22:02,230 --> 00:22:03,630
So far they've been decent

463
00:22:05,040 --> 00:22:08,610
Holding the rope, I spun it around at high speeds and did a double skip

464
00:22:08,610 --> 00:22:09,870
Yes, yes

465
00:22:09,870 --> 00:22:14,480
You hold the rope, and in one jump, you skip twice

466
00:22:10,670 --> 00:22:11,180
Yes

467
00:22:12,240 --> 00:22:12,780
Yes

468
00:22:13,580 --> 00:22:14,480
Exactly

469
00:22:14,810 --> 00:22:16,550
Could you try it?

470
00:22:17,310 --> 00:22:19,380
One.. Two.. Thr-

471
00:22:24,690 --> 00:22:27,930
I don't mean a skipping rope!

472
00:22:30,760 --> 00:22:32,600
Bu bu bu bu

473
00:22:32,600 --> 00:22:34,160
Would you shut it?

474
00:22:33,660 --> 00:22:35,030
Ah, I gotcha!

475
00:22:34,900 --> 00:22:36,600
Saying all those things

476
00:22:36,930 --> 00:22:38,400
let's see you try

477
00:22:38,400 --> 00:22:39,870
giving a Senryu poem

478
00:22:39,400 --> 00:22:40,400
I see

479
00:22:39,870 --> 00:22:41,210
Alright

480
00:22:41,210 --> 00:22:43,010
Could you give me a topic?

481
00:22:43,440 --> 00:22:44,480
Well

482
00:22:44,480 --> 00:22:46,780
The concerns of a Pro Wrestler's future

483
00:22:46,780 --> 00:22:48,510
Concerns of the future?..

484
00:22:51,580 --> 00:22:53,080
Concerns..

485
00:22:54,720 --> 00:22:57,220
Jeez, are there any?

486
00:22:57,220 --> 00:22:58,720
Pain in the legs

487
00:22:58,720 --> 00:23:00,260
Pain in the back

488
00:23:01,190 --> 00:23:02,530
No

489
00:23:03,060 --> 00:23:06,500
Back pain, back pain..

490
00:23:11,670 --> 00:23:13,200
What did he do?

491
00:23:13,070 --> 00:23:16,710
There's no way I could do a 5-7-5 with that!

492
00:23:17,640 --> 00:23:20,340
Don't do anymore Senryu poems

493
00:23:20,940 --> 00:23:21,550
That's it!

494
00:23:21,550 --> 00:23:23,680
Thank you

495
00:23:21,550 --> 00:23:23,680
Thank you

496
00:23:26,920 --> 00:23:29,320
The crude conversations

497
00:23:29,890 --> 00:23:33,360
matches well with the strong, yet splendid retort

498
00:23:33,360 --> 00:23:36,830
that did well to make the entire place laughing

499
00:23:38,060 --> 00:23:40,430
Now, continuing on..

500
00:23:41,270 --> 00:23:47,600
We have the master Razor Lemon RG taking on the challenge by pairing up with professionals of different genres

501
00:23:51,180 --> 00:23:53,940
Yeah Yeah Yeah

502
00:23:55,310 --> 00:23:57,710
What's happening with his head?

503
00:23:56,150 --> 00:23:58,820
Hello, nice to meet you

504
00:23:57,180 --> 00:23:58,320
Hello, nice to meet you

505
00:23:59,080 --> 00:24:01,020
What's this?

506
00:23:59,080 --> 00:24:03,290
So, truth be told I've noticed I'm actually better at Senryu poetry than I am at comedy

507
00:24:02,490 --> 00:24:03,290
Awesome

508
00:24:03,290 --> 00:24:05,690
So can you try doing one about American Football?

509
00:24:05,690 --> 00:24:06,690
I can

510
00:24:07,420 --> 00:24:13,600
when locked in a scrum, by secretly letting go of my strength,will it have an impact?

511
00:24:13,600 --> 00:24:14,870
Not bad

512
00:24:15,300 --> 00:24:19,700
It could probably work if there were a lot of you if you tried.

513
00:24:16,900 --> 00:24:18,470
He's waiting for it!

514
00:24:19,700 --> 00:24:22,240
Ah this feels good

515
00:24:20,340 --> 00:24:21,810
Scary scary

516
00:24:21,810 --> 00:24:23,910
But I understand what he meant

517
00:24:25,780 --> 00:24:29,280
Now that you say that, there were too many characters.

518
00:24:30,410 --> 00:24:31,250
Too many..

519
00:24:32,450 --> 00:24:35,350
there were too many characters

520
00:24:36,850 --> 00:24:38,990
Ah well

521
00:24:41,490 --> 00:24:43,490
Next up, a Kendo athlete

522
00:24:45,700 --> 00:24:50,830
and an SM dominatrix as well take the stage for the serious role with RG

523
00:24:50,830 --> 00:24:51,840
and then

524
00:24:56,810 --> 00:24:58,780
Hey, listen up

525
00:24:58,780 --> 00:25:03,510
everyone's been very strict on the Senryu poems, could you please give me one of your own

526
00:25:04,210 --> 00:25:05,450
Ah okay

527
00:25:05,450 --> 00:25:07,780
Could you give me a theme?

528
00:25:07,780 --> 00:25:13,690
Ah, "The feelings of a police dog being kept by humans", if you would

529
00:25:14,890 --> 00:25:17,260
This is a hard one

530
00:25:19,000 --> 00:25:20,160
What's up with that?

531
00:25:20,160 --> 00:25:22,200
Watch out

532
00:25:22,200 --> 00:25:24,170
When you're on the run

533
00:25:24,170 --> 00:25:25,700
this is hard

534
00:25:26,170 --> 00:25:28,840
When they see the chance, they'll bite you at your throat

535
00:25:28,840 --> 00:25:30,210
Go go

536
00:25:34,750 --> 00:25:35,650
What is this?

537
00:25:37,010 --> 00:25:37,920
This is bad

538
00:25:38,320 --> 00:25:40,020
What's wrong?

539
00:25:42,250 --> 00:25:46,160
There's no way I could do a 5-7-5 with that!

540
00:25:46,920 --> 00:25:48,560
Don't you try...

541
00:25:48,260 --> 00:25:50,030
What's going on

542
00:25:48,860 --> 00:25:50,760
...to do senryuu ever again!

543
00:25:51,130 --> 00:25:52,030
I'm done!

544
00:25:52,030 --> 00:25:53,560
No you're not

545
00:25:52,030 --> 00:25:54,330
Thank you

546
00:25:54,930 --> 00:25:56,270
It was over the top

547
00:25:56,270 --> 00:25:58,000
It was great

548
00:25:57,600 --> 00:26:00,640
A manzai that was changing dramatically

549
00:26:00,640 --> 00:26:05,380
matched with strong and fun serious roles, that make up the comedy duo

550
00:26:06,480 --> 00:26:09,080
The next challengers are..

551
00:26:10,110 --> 00:26:11,210
We're looking forward to it

552
00:26:11,210 --> 00:26:12,620
Uh-huh

553
00:26:13,250 --> 00:26:18,520
Death Match Wrestlers: Kenji Fukimoto and Jun Kasai

554
00:26:17,490 --> 00:26:19,360
They sure like using wrestlers

555
00:26:19,120 --> 00:26:22,030
The serious role will be played by Death Match's top combatant

556
00:26:22,030 --> 00:26:27,260
blood-shedding and Japan's number 1 extreme wrestler, Jun Kasai

557
00:26:27,760 --> 00:26:30,400
What you've appointed for us on the broadcast

558
00:26:30,400 --> 00:26:31,940
We'll make you regret

559
00:26:31,940 --> 00:26:35,910
We'll cause accidents

560
00:26:36,010 --> 00:26:37,210
What the?

561
00:26:41,680 --> 00:26:43,880
Hello

562
00:26:43,180 --> 00:26:43,880
Welcome

563
00:26:43,880 --> 00:26:47,990
We are Death Match Wrestlers, nice to meet you

564
00:26:49,020 --> 00:26:50,220
So, truth be told

565
00:26:50,620 --> 00:26:51,660
I've noticed I'm actually better at Senryu poetry

566
00:26:52,020 --> 00:26:54,090
than I am at Death Match

567
00:26:54,590 --> 00:26:56,560
Woah, that's cool

568
00:26:56,560 --> 00:26:59,830
Then, could you give us a poem about being reckless

569
00:26:59,830 --> 00:27:01,800
I've got one

570
00:27:00,730 --> 00:27:01,800
That was fast!

571
00:27:03,100 --> 00:27:05,940
If you are called reckless

572
00:27:05,940 --> 00:27:08,470
you'd very much hate the fear of pain

573
00:27:08,470 --> 00:27:12,680
but until you see your grandchild, you don't want to die

574
00:27:13,710 --> 00:27:16,510
Pretty interesting

575
00:27:17,550 --> 00:27:19,420
That would be true

576
00:27:20,650 --> 00:27:22,850
That would be the real intention

577
00:27:22,850 --> 00:27:24,420
His back is astounding

578
00:27:27,890 --> 00:27:29,460
Now that you say that,

579
00:27:29,460 --> 00:27:32,060
there were too many characters

580
00:27:32,500 --> 00:27:33,630
So scary!

581
00:27:33,700 --> 00:27:37,100
Well then, up next, try one about ambulances

582
00:27:34,830 --> 00:27:36,570
Look at the scars on his chest...

583
00:27:37,100 --> 00:27:38,770
I've got one

584
00:27:37,770 --> 00:27:38,770
So fast!

585
00:27:39,240 --> 00:27:41,970
Another member complains

586
00:27:43,870 --> 00:27:46,440
Yes yes, exactly

587
00:27:47,010 --> 00:27:49,480
Ambulances readily go back

588
00:27:51,180 --> 00:27:54,790
but that is just a common misconception

589
00:27:52,080 --> 00:27:53,650
He pulled it out!

590
00:27:54,450 --> 00:27:56,690
He carries a lot

591
00:27:55,190 --> 00:27:56,690
He's keeps pulling things out

592
00:28:00,020 --> 00:28:01,320
Wow, that was actually weak

593
00:28:00,260 --> 00:28:03,290
But this time, you were too short!

594
00:28:04,160 --> 00:28:05,560
What?

595
00:28:05,230 --> 00:28:07,000
Let's see, next

596
00:28:07,860 --> 00:28:10,070
try one about blood-shed

597
00:28:10,070 --> 00:28:11,370
I've got it

598
00:28:11,370 --> 00:28:15,870
No longer worried when you're at a hospital with 5 stitches

599
00:28:15,870 --> 00:28:18,280
yes yes

600
00:28:17,840 --> 00:28:19,710
What is it this time?

601
00:28:18,280 --> 00:28:21,010
That was a proper 5-7-5 poem

602
00:28:22,350 --> 00:28:25,220
As expected for Senryu poetry

603
00:28:25,220 --> 00:28:27,250
Scary scary

604
00:28:26,080 --> 00:28:30,220
(Can't be shown due to Compliance Programming)

605
00:28:30,350 --> 00:28:33,290
If you keep telling me my poetry's off, let's see you give an example

606
00:28:33,560 --> 00:28:34,560
What, me?

607
00:28:34,990 --> 00:28:40,000
"The feelings of a parent whose child came to watch a match"

608
00:28:42,030 --> 00:28:44,370
This is difficult

609
00:28:45,070 --> 00:28:46,800
Blood is dripping

610
00:28:46,800 --> 00:28:48,610
wondering if they'll be okay

611
00:28:48,610 --> 00:28:50,040
Wait, no

612
00:28:50,710 --> 00:28:52,710
It's my job

613
00:28:52,710 --> 00:28:55,480
If I don't do it, I'll be fired

614
00:28:55,480 --> 00:28:57,950
Hmm, this too is wrong

615
00:29:00,120 --> 00:29:01,790
Painful memories

616
00:29:01,790 --> 00:29:03,690
will be born however

617
00:29:03,690 --> 00:29:06,160
No, this too is also wrong

618
00:29:05,560 --> 00:29:07,560
What are they doing?

619
00:29:09,730 --> 00:29:11,760
Very high up

620
00:29:10,860 --> 00:29:11,960
Yeah

621
00:29:17,500 --> 00:29:18,440
AARGH

622
00:29:21,000 --> 00:29:22,770
All you could hear were shrieks

623
00:29:23,310 --> 00:29:28,180
There's no way I could do a 5-7-5 with that!

624
00:29:28,880 --> 00:29:32,950
When the retort is too strong, it puts people off instead

625
00:29:32,420 --> 00:29:34,350
Exactly as expected

626
00:29:34,350 --> 00:29:36,090
It's no good if you go too strong

627
00:29:36,090 --> 00:29:37,820
Too strong of an reaction is unpleasant

628
00:29:37,820 --> 00:29:38,920
You were totally horror-struck

629
00:29:38,920 --> 00:29:40,020
Exactly

630
00:29:40,320 --> 00:29:43,060
The ones who brought forth this theory shouldn't be afraid

631
00:29:43,060 --> 00:29:45,330
If you saw it live, it's just as bad

632
00:29:45,330 --> 00:29:47,330
From a female point of view, how did you think of it?

633
00:29:47,330 --> 00:29:49,930
My hands were sweating and I was getting goosebumps

634
00:29:49,930 --> 00:29:53,140
They were also swearing like hell

635
00:29:50,430 --> 00:29:53,140
It was so extreme, didn't real blood start to come out?

636
00:29:53,140 --> 00:29:58,110
But even with me normally, having Hamada as the serious role, I've had blood come out before

637
00:29:58,910 --> 00:30:00,810
We were doing a sketch about detectives

638
00:30:01,020 --> 00:30:03,050
And he was supposed to interrogate me

639
00:30:03,050 --> 00:30:06,000
so he's like: "Spit it out!" and I'm like: "No way"

640
00:30:06,000 --> 00:30:10,120
There was a pen on the table, and he grabbed me like this and went

641
00:30:10,140 --> 00:30:12,050
BANG onto the table

642
00:30:12,050 --> 00:30:14,370
and the pen went in!

643
00:30:14,770 --> 00:30:17,510
Blood was dripping out

644
00:30:17,510 --> 00:30:20,020
and obviously, I spat it out

645
00:30:21,970 --> 00:30:23,620
Real quick

646
00:30:24,940 --> 00:30:25,910
Next up

647
00:30:25,910 --> 00:30:29,250
We will introduce more theories around the world, and verify them

648
00:30:29,250 --> 00:30:31,510
Here on Viewers' Theory Corner

649
00:30:31,800 --> 00:30:33,850
Tonight's presenter is..

650
00:30:37,110 --> 00:30:39,400
Koyabu Kazutoyo

651
00:30:39,400 --> 00:30:41,400
It's good to be here

652
00:30:41,400 --> 00:30:43,850
Here's a quick verification I did the other day

653
00:30:43,850 --> 00:30:45,570
"Otsukare-sama deshita"

654
00:30:45,570 --> 00:30:48,680
The theory that if the "O" and "shita" are present

655
00:30:48,680 --> 00:30:50,280
Anything could go in between

656
00:30:50,280 --> 00:30:52,400
Ah, indeed

657
00:30:51,510 --> 00:30:52,400
I remember that

658
00:30:52,400 --> 00:30:54,400
That is indeed the case

659
00:30:54,400 --> 00:30:56,540
But this time, an everyday occurrence

660
00:30:56,540 --> 00:31:01,450
I bring you, "When you hear it, but don't notice it" Series, Part 2

661
00:31:00,280 --> 00:31:01,450
I see

662
00:31:01,450 --> 00:31:03,450
Here it is

663
00:31:03,450 --> 00:31:07,540
The theory of restaurant music: Changing the lyrics of famous songs

664
00:31:07,540 --> 00:31:10,110
and seeing if anyone will notice

665
00:31:11,820 --> 00:31:13,600
We'll see if this will work.

666
00:31:14,280 --> 00:31:16,420
It'd probably depend on how you do it

667
00:31:16,420 --> 00:31:20,090
If they didn't know the song, they might think those are the lyrics

668
00:31:20,110 --> 00:31:23,740
For the songs, if they only know the first couplet

669
00:31:23,740 --> 00:31:25,880
they might think that they just don't know the rest of it

670
00:31:25,880 --> 00:31:26,940
I see

671
00:31:26,940 --> 00:31:30,650
So, we've tested the theory. Please watch!

672
00:31:31,420 --> 00:31:37,020
Verifying: Theory of not noticing the different lyrics to famous songs being played inside restaurants

673
00:31:37,020 --> 00:31:39,020
This is gonna be interesting

674
00:31:39,020 --> 00:31:43,340
This time, the research has been conducted at this cafe

675
00:31:44,000 --> 00:31:46,110
The first song is..

676
00:31:49,420 --> 00:31:51,220
Great song

677
00:31:50,200 --> 00:31:52,140
Tube's song

678
00:31:50,450 --> 00:31:53,280
"Ah~ Summer Holidays"

679
00:31:53,280 --> 00:31:55,710
Let's change around the singers

680
00:31:56,400 --> 00:31:57,970
Who is it?

681
00:31:56,400 --> 00:31:59,050
The singer for the changed song not only has similar appearances

682
00:31:59,050 --> 00:32:02,480
but also his voice is very similar, Bu-Tube

683
00:32:01,280 --> 00:32:03,970
It's an imitation

684
00:32:02,570 --> 00:32:08,680
The targets are these three people, where the fake song was played on different days

685
00:32:04,880 --> 00:32:06,850
They don't seem motivated

686
00:32:06,850 --> 00:32:09,940
Fujimoto is quite sensitive these kinds of small changes

687
00:32:09,140 --> 00:32:12,540
During the time they are waiting on their order

688
00:32:09,910 --> 00:32:13,800
I have a feeling Hashimoto wouldn't get this wrong

689
00:32:12,570 --> 00:32:15,710
the song with changed lyrics was played

690
00:32:22,740 --> 00:32:27,710
Will we see if they have noticed the changes made in the lyrics?

691
00:32:24,620 --> 00:32:26,910
Chris will know this

692
00:32:26,910 --> 00:32:28,770
Chris knows a lot about this song

693
00:32:28,770 --> 00:32:31,250
Chris likes this song

694
00:32:42,020 --> 00:32:45,280
If you listen to it often, you'd be fine

695
00:32:45,280 --> 00:32:47,280
like this guy

696
00:32:48,140 --> 00:32:50,000
The very similar imitation to the song

697
00:32:50,000 --> 00:32:55,110
has left these three clueless that it is a different singer

698
00:32:55,110 --> 00:32:56,710
I see

699
00:32:56,710 --> 00:32:58,570
Eventually down the line

700
00:32:58,570 --> 00:33:01,340
small changes are made to the lyrics

701
00:33:01,940 --> 00:33:03,940
First is Level 1

702
00:33:03,940 --> 00:33:08,450
The hit line "Ah, Summer Holidays" is changed

703
00:33:04,740 --> 00:33:06,650
Eh, they're changing that?

704
00:33:06,220 --> 00:33:08,140
I would notice it

705
00:33:09,510 --> 00:33:11,200
What is the result?

706
00:33:10,280 --> 00:33:12,080
Isn't that risky?

707
00:33:12,080 --> 00:33:13,910
Is this only Level 1?

708
00:33:13,200 --> 00:33:15,170
Isn't it too obvious?

709
00:33:14,440 --> 00:33:22,880
"Ah, I love Summer"

710
00:33:14,440 --> 00:33:22,880
"Ah, Summer Holidays"

711
00:33:21,540 --> 00:33:23,940
Ah I see

712
00:33:22,650 --> 00:33:23,940
Like that?

713
00:33:24,570 --> 00:33:26,480
Ah, like that way

714
00:33:25,850 --> 00:33:30,540
As expected, the subtle change to the lyrics has gone through the three

715
00:33:31,250 --> 00:33:33,970
Next up is Level 2

716
00:33:33,970 --> 00:33:38,510
The second lyrics are still related to summer, but are totally different

717
00:33:37,960 --> 00:33:45,240
The night was night, watching fireworks in yukata

718
00:33:38,400 --> 00:33:41,000
The Kabuto Beetle goes on a test of courage at night

719
00:33:41,000 --> 00:33:42,430
The Kabuto Beetle goes on a test of courage at night

720
00:33:42,430 --> 00:33:45,240
The Kabuto Beetle goes on a test of courage at night

721
00:33:45,240 --> 00:33:52,610
My eyes can't keep up as time goes by

722
00:33:45,470 --> 00:33:46,470
Surfers in swimsuits gather down by the shores

723
00:33:46,470 --> 00:33:48,340
Surfers in swimsuits gather down by the shores

724
00:33:48,340 --> 00:33:50,070
Surfers in swimsuits gather down by the shores

725
00:33:50,070 --> 00:33:52,610
Surfers in swimsuits gather down by the shores

726
00:33:52,610 --> 00:33:59,280
The shadows shake around like they're bowing

727
00:33:53,010 --> 00:33:55,580
Cold dishes, perhaps flowing noodles

728
00:33:54,710 --> 00:33:56,740
Just like that?

729
00:33:55,580 --> 00:33:56,480
Cold dishes, perhaps flowing noodles

730
00:33:56,480 --> 00:33:59,280
Cold dishes, perhaps flowing noodles

731
00:33:58,680 --> 00:34:01,420
Using those kinds of summer words

732
00:33:59,280 --> 00:34:07,090
The shining rouge is wet and trembling, I've got you

733
00:34:00,080 --> 00:34:02,890
One watermelon is not enough for a family of 5

734
00:34:02,890 --> 00:34:07,090
One watermelon is not enough for a family of 5

735
00:34:02,940 --> 00:34:04,650
Ah? No way

736
00:34:07,000 --> 00:34:09,080
It's not weird?

737
00:34:07,090 --> 00:34:14,060
You can forget about the tears buried in the sand

738
00:34:07,460 --> 00:34:11,060
That shaved ice that was eaten at the Summer Festival

739
00:34:09,160 --> 00:34:10,890
Whose cover is this?

740
00:34:11,060 --> 00:34:14,060
That shaved ice that was eaten at the Summer Festival

741
00:34:11,900 --> 00:34:14,060
Whose cover?

742
00:34:13,000 --> 00:34:15,000
That's impressive

743
00:34:14,060 --> 00:34:22,770
Hesitating to be left out, the crickets cry too

744
00:34:14,620 --> 00:34:17,420
I wouldn't be able to tell

745
00:34:14,860 --> 00:34:18,370
Your yukata is like a dream, as pretty as fireflies

746
00:34:18,370 --> 00:34:22,770
Your yukata is like a dream, as pretty as fireflies

747
00:34:22,400 --> 00:34:24,910
"Whose cover?" he said

748
00:34:23,510 --> 00:34:28,000
Here we see that he has noticed it's not the actual artist

749
00:34:26,480 --> 00:34:28,940
Ah, incredible

750
00:34:27,540 --> 00:34:29,200
It is

751
00:34:28,110 --> 00:34:32,940
The remaining two people aren't particularly showing any reaction

752
00:34:33,110 --> 00:34:36,220
Now onto the final level 3

753
00:34:36,220 --> 00:34:39,340
The chorus of the song will be entirely Winter-based

754
00:34:39,940 --> 00:34:42,050
It'll be noticed this time

755
00:34:43,960 --> 00:34:51,940
Hold me tight, was our meeting in a dream?

756
00:34:44,760 --> 00:34:45,900
Winter Love, is the snow melting? My fingers are freezing up

757
00:34:45,900 --> 00:34:47,730
Winter Love, is the snow melting? My fingers are freezing up

758
00:34:47,730 --> 00:34:51,940
Winter Love, is the snow melting? My fingers are freezing up

759
00:34:51,940 --> 00:34:58,910
It may just be a number in Summer, but I love you

760
00:34:52,200 --> 00:34:52,940
I want to love you as much as the snow melts from the slopes

761
00:34:52,940 --> 00:34:55,510
I want to love you as much as the snow melts from the slopes

762
00:34:55,020 --> 00:34:57,000
Chris already knows

763
00:34:55,510 --> 00:34:58,910
I want to love you as much as the snow melts from the slopes

764
00:34:55,670 --> 00:34:56,470
This isn't it, if it's not Maeda, I don't feel motivated

765
00:34:56,470 --> 00:34:57,240
This isn't it, if it's not Maeda, I don't feel motivated

766
00:34:57,240 --> 00:34:58,910
This isn't it, if it's not Maeda, I don't feel motivated

767
00:34:58,910 --> 00:35:06,080
It's all right to burn ourselves from our embrace

768
00:34:59,210 --> 00:35:00,380
My lover Santa Claus is making my heart turn white from the snow

769
00:35:00,380 --> 00:35:02,410
My lover Santa Claus is making my heart turn white from the snow

770
00:35:02,410 --> 00:35:06,080
My lover Santa Claus is making my heart turn white from the snow

771
00:35:05,220 --> 00:35:08,250
He hasn't moved at all

772
00:35:06,080 --> 00:35:09,590
Ah, Summer Holidays

773
00:35:06,680 --> 00:35:09,590
Ah, New Years

774
00:35:09,590 --> 00:35:19,160
Exhausted after a small swim, my chest is cool baby

775
00:35:09,850 --> 00:35:13,360
Grandpa is coming to give us our New Year's gift baby

776
00:35:11,650 --> 00:35:12,090
This is one of those parody songs?

777
00:35:12,090 --> 00:35:13,090
This is one of those parody songs?

778
00:35:13,090 --> 00:35:15,530
This is one of those parody songs?

779
00:35:13,360 --> 00:35:19,160
Grandpa is coming to give us our New Year's gift baby

780
00:35:15,530 --> 00:35:16,630
I'm pretty sure he never said "New Year"

781
00:35:16,630 --> 00:35:19,160
I'm pretty sure he never said "New Year"

782
00:35:17,340 --> 00:35:19,820
He knew too much

783
00:35:18,250 --> 00:35:19,820
Right?

784
00:35:19,820 --> 00:35:22,800
Now all will be revealed

785
00:35:23,770 --> 00:35:25,820
We're from Wednesday Downtown

786
00:35:25,820 --> 00:35:27,370
What did you put in this?

787
00:35:27,370 --> 00:35:28,680
Nothing's in it!

788
00:35:28,680 --> 00:35:31,310
Why is he suspicious about the drink?

789
00:35:31,310 --> 00:35:34,050
How could I not notice it?

790
00:35:34,620 --> 00:35:37,540
I know the song "Ah Summer Holidays"

791
00:35:37,540 --> 00:35:39,540
I feel sorry for the original singer, Maeda

792
00:35:39,200 --> 00:35:42,000
I see

793
00:35:40,000 --> 00:35:42,000
I apologise

794
00:35:40,110 --> 00:35:44,340
We also reveal it to the two people who didn't react

795
00:35:51,760 --> 00:35:53,430
It's about cold

796
00:35:54,420 --> 00:35:56,880
It's the original, right?

797
00:35:57,280 --> 00:36:00,970
As expected, he didn't notice anything at all

798
00:36:02,570 --> 00:36:04,170
I never imagined

799
00:36:04,170 --> 00:36:06,910
that my first time on Wednesday Downtown would be this way

800
00:36:06,940 --> 00:36:08,910
I apologize ..

801
00:36:09,450 --> 00:36:11,970
However, with Fujimoto

802
00:36:11,970 --> 00:36:14,570
I noticed it

803
00:36:14,570 --> 00:36:15,970
But..

804
00:36:15,970 --> 00:36:19,000
I thought it was like a parody song or something

805
00:36:17,680 --> 00:36:19,820
I see, I see

806
00:36:19,310 --> 00:36:22,770
Was this a joke, or maybe it wasn't?

807
00:36:22,770 --> 00:36:26,600
Could you please stop with jokes I don't understand?

808
00:36:27,220 --> 00:36:32,910
As expected, when the lyrics were entirely changed, people noticed

809
00:36:31,170 --> 00:36:33,050
Ah, I see

810
00:36:33,480 --> 00:36:36,110
So, how about this pattern

811
00:36:36,110 --> 00:36:41,800
We will change the lyrics from Tsuyoshi Nagabuchi's "Dragonfly" to Tsuyoshi Nagabuchi's "Bubbles"

812
00:36:42,480 --> 00:36:46,220
Continuing on, how about this pattern

813
00:36:46,220 --> 00:36:51,200
we will change the lyrics from Tsuyoshi Nagabuchi's "Dragonfly" to Tsuyoshi Nagabuchi's "Bubbles"

814
00:36:52,020 --> 00:36:54,510
The targets will be these three people

815
00:36:54,510 --> 00:36:56,510
The one on the right is a musician

816
00:36:55,910 --> 00:36:57,650
The results..

817
00:36:57,990 --> 00:37:03,300
Tearing up the asphalt

818
00:36:59,000 --> 00:37:00,930
The stinging wound

819
00:37:00,930 --> 00:37:03,300
The stinging wound

820
00:37:03,300 --> 00:37:07,470
made me unable to sleep

821
00:37:03,300 --> 00:37:07,470
with every footstep I make

822
00:37:07,470 --> 00:37:16,150
I wished to continue living as myself

823
00:37:07,700 --> 00:37:12,140
On the night I was taking a whizz, a crying face

824
00:37:12,140 --> 00:37:16,150
On the night I was taking a whizz, a crying face

825
00:37:16,510 --> 00:37:24,950
Ah, where are you, happy dragonfly

826
00:37:16,950 --> 00:37:18,720
Crying in sadness, I throw myself off

827
00:37:18,720 --> 00:37:20,880
Crying in sadness, I throw myself off

828
00:37:19,740 --> 00:37:23,000
The lyrics work well

829
00:37:20,880 --> 00:37:22,550
Crying in sadness, I throw myself off

830
00:37:22,550 --> 00:37:24,950
Crying in sadness, I throw myself off

831
00:37:24,310 --> 00:37:26,220
I would help

832
00:37:24,950 --> 00:37:32,560
Where have you flown off to?

833
00:37:24,950 --> 00:37:32,560
Where have you flown off to?

834
00:37:25,390 --> 00:37:28,290
wanting to be more of myself

835
00:37:28,290 --> 00:37:29,560
wanting to be more of myself

836
00:37:29,560 --> 00:37:32,560
wanting to be more of myself

837
00:37:31,630 --> 00:37:32,100
Ah, these are different lyrics

838
00:37:32,100 --> 00:37:34,330
Ah, these are different lyrics

839
00:37:32,560 --> 00:37:42,310
Oh, happy dragonfly

840
00:37:34,330 --> 00:37:40,200
But here I am, emotionless in the city skies

841
00:37:35,340 --> 00:37:36,850
Impressive

842
00:37:40,200 --> 00:37:42,310
But here I am, emotionless in the city skies

843
00:37:42,310 --> 00:37:52,450
I stick out my tongue and laugh

844
00:37:42,710 --> 00:37:44,610
How many bubbles will be blown I wonder?

845
00:37:44,570 --> 00:37:45,610
How many bubbles will be blown I wonder?

846
00:37:45,610 --> 00:37:52,450
How many bubbles will be blown I wonder?

847
00:37:47,740 --> 00:37:49,570
Ohh

848
00:37:49,880 --> 00:37:50,150
No way, this isn't "Tonbo"

849
00:37:50,150 --> 00:37:52,450
No way, this isn't "Tonbo"

850
00:37:52,970 --> 00:37:55,050
I had a feeling it was strange, that's why

851
00:37:55,050 --> 00:37:56,370
it wasn't very good

852
00:37:56,370 --> 00:37:57,770
I noticed the whole thing

853
00:37:57,770 --> 00:37:59,620
There wouldn't be anyone who wouldn't recognise that

854
00:37:59,620 --> 00:38:01,620
Not even one person

855
00:38:01,620 --> 00:38:06,400
However, these two people still haven't noticed

856
00:38:03,680 --> 00:38:06,800
Really, they may be ignoring it honestly

857
00:38:07,280 --> 00:38:09,800
Lastly, we'll go by this pattern

858
00:38:09,800 --> 00:38:13,080
Hideaki Tokunaga's "Fragmented Radio"

859
00:38:13,080 --> 00:38:14,710
will be arranged by this artist

860
00:38:14,710 --> 00:38:16,820
Hullo, hullo

861
00:38:16,820 --> 00:38:18,340
Hullo, hullo

862
00:38:18,220 --> 00:38:20,020
Why?

863
00:38:19,050 --> 00:38:22,570
The song will be arranged by Hollywood Zako Shisho

864
00:38:23,600 --> 00:38:26,370
These three will be the targets

865
00:38:26,370 --> 00:38:28,170
What is the result?

866
00:38:31,110 --> 00:38:33,650
Not many girls

867
00:38:39,540 --> 00:38:41,600
What is he doing?

868
00:38:45,800 --> 00:38:47,340
It's still continuing

869
00:38:46,870 --> 00:38:47,940
"Hamma Camma", who's version is this?

870
00:38:47,940 --> 00:38:49,340
"Hamma Camma", who's version is this?

871
00:38:48,880 --> 00:38:51,080
You already know who

872
00:38:53,140 --> 00:38:55,050
What kind of message is this?

873
00:38:56,340 --> 00:38:58,680
Is this a compliment?

874
00:38:59,680 --> 00:39:01,280
Is this really out?

875
00:39:02,800 --> 00:39:05,140
The fuck is that guy singing

876
00:39:14,820 --> 00:39:18,600
There must be lots of covers of Tokunaga's song

877
00:39:18,000 --> 00:39:20,140
Lots of them

878
00:39:18,600 --> 00:39:22,170
And there's this version?

879
00:39:24,000 --> 00:39:27,310
"Hamma Camma" version?

880
00:39:31,740 --> 00:39:33,480
It's just "Hamma Camma"

881
00:39:36,200 --> 00:39:41,740
And with that, as expected, Hamma Camma was noticed

882
00:39:40,340 --> 00:39:42,880
That's how it is

883
00:39:43,220 --> 00:39:45,740
A surprise, wasn't it?

884
00:39:45,740 --> 00:39:47,740
Me and everyone else

885
00:39:47,740 --> 00:39:50,000
was very astonished by this

886
00:39:50,220 --> 00:39:54,140
"Fragmented Radio" was replaced by

887
00:39:54,140 --> 00:39:56,020
"Hamma Hamma"

888
00:39:56,020 --> 00:39:57,540
"Camma"

889
00:39:57,540 --> 00:40:00,220
and not "Hamma Camma Hamma"

890
00:40:02,180 --> 00:40:03,680
Okay everyone, here's another quick one

891
00:40:03,680 --> 00:40:07,180
Have you ever been in a state where no matter what happens, you'd be unable to resist,

892
00:40:07,180 --> 00:40:10,880
or there's ever been a time where you felt helpless?

893
00:40:11,050 --> 00:40:12,720
There has been

894
00:40:11,050 --> 00:40:12,720
There would be, right?

895
00:40:12,720 --> 00:40:14,290
You haven't, Izumi?

896
00:40:14,290 --> 00:40:16,330
Like when holding off going to the restroom?

897
00:40:16,590 --> 00:40:17,260
Is that what you mean?

898
00:40:17,260 --> 00:40:19,100
You can definitely hold it in

899
00:40:19,100 --> 00:40:22,170
I can even hold it for two hours

900
00:40:23,200 --> 00:40:25,000
What are you talking about?!

901
00:40:25,000 --> 00:40:27,970
I thought there'd be a better one but you totally missed it

902
00:40:26,400 --> 00:40:27,970
Okay you've got her

903
00:40:27,970 --> 00:40:29,870
He's locked on

904
00:40:27,970 --> 00:40:30,070
What the hell is feeling powerless holding in your pee!

905
00:40:30,070 --> 00:40:34,610
Think about it a bit! You ain't gonna get paid just sitting on your ass cuz you got a pretty face you idiot!!

906
00:40:34,610 --> 00:40:36,350
So sorry for you

907
00:40:36,350 --> 00:40:38,880
Feel grateful for your parents and grandparents

908
00:40:38,880 --> 00:40:40,750
His emotion are a bit...

909
00:40:40,750 --> 00:40:44,150
Now, I bring you this theory based on that

910
00:40:45,290 --> 00:40:49,930
The theory of being helpless when you're carrying a urine sample

911
00:40:50,360 --> 00:40:51,760
We did some verification if urine

912
00:40:51,760 --> 00:40:56,100
does make you helpless, please watch the following

913
00:40:54,200 --> 00:40:56,100
What kind of verification are you doing?

914
00:40:57,070 --> 00:41:02,770
We investigate the theory of being helpless when you're carrying a urine sample

915
00:41:01,740 --> 00:41:03,110
Is there a point to this?

916
00:41:03,270 --> 00:41:11,780
For this we have 4 celebrities being called out to a specialized hospital prior to a fake health examination

917
00:41:11,110 --> 00:41:12,420
Komiya's in this

918
00:41:12,420 --> 00:41:16,490
The doctor's room is directly 10m from the toilet

919
00:41:16,490 --> 00:41:21,820
While they're carrying urine, they will run into 4 obstacles

920
00:41:22,330 --> 00:41:24,090
The first person is..

921
00:41:25,230 --> 00:41:27,630
Sanshiro's Komiya

922
00:41:27,960 --> 00:41:30,630
The urine that was deposited..

923
00:41:30,630 --> 00:41:34,570
Sorry, this didn't have your name on it, could you please take a seat over there?

924
00:41:34,570 --> 00:41:36,140
is left in the nurse's care..

925
00:41:37,410 --> 00:41:40,640
and is swapped out for tea and returned back

926
00:41:37,940 --> 00:41:39,180
Ah they swapped it

927
00:41:38,640 --> 00:41:39,880
Ah that's great

928
00:41:40,440 --> 00:41:41,340
I see

929
00:41:41,510 --> 00:41:44,480
The first obstacle faced is..

930
00:41:44,810 --> 00:41:46,720
Thank you for waiting

931
00:41:46,720 --> 00:41:49,050
Please hold onto this and wait

932
00:41:49,720 --> 00:41:53,960
What would you do if there was a woman next to you?

933
00:41:52,420 --> 00:41:53,820
This definitely is bad

934
00:41:53,820 --> 00:41:55,090
Ah this situation exists

935
00:41:53,990 --> 00:41:55,060
Please excuse me

936
00:41:59,460 --> 00:42:01,530
He keeps it hidden

937
00:42:02,870 --> 00:42:06,100
Continuing on is Trendy Angel's Saito

938
00:42:05,230 --> 00:42:06,300
Ah Saito's here

939
00:42:06,640 --> 00:42:08,440
Sorry, excuse me

940
00:42:08,440 --> 00:42:09,940
Please hold onto this and wait

941
00:42:09,940 --> 00:42:11,710
Do I have to wait?..

942
00:42:15,140 --> 00:42:18,550
As expected, it is left in a place that can't be seen

943
00:42:20,320 --> 00:42:22,290
Now with Masaya Nakamura

944
00:42:22,050 --> 00:42:23,550
What's with his face?

945
00:42:23,090 --> 00:42:25,190
he placed it between his legs

946
00:42:26,720 --> 00:42:30,560
Then there's Ebisu who is surrounded by two women

947
00:42:28,790 --> 00:42:31,190
What would you do if you were surrounded?

948
00:42:34,700 --> 00:42:38,940
He places it somewhere that can't be seen either way

949
00:42:38,400 --> 00:42:39,540
He's embarrassed

950
00:42:38,400 --> 00:42:39,540
Understandable

951
00:42:40,070 --> 00:42:43,670
As expected, are they embarrassed for it to be seen by females?

952
00:42:43,670 --> 00:42:47,710
They all pretend as if the urine is non-existent

953
00:42:48,110 --> 00:42:48,810
Komiya

954
00:42:48,810 --> 00:42:51,380
Yes, coming, excuse me

955
00:42:51,380 --> 00:42:52,480
Good luck

956
00:42:52,480 --> 00:42:54,220
Ah, excuse me, Komiya

957
00:42:54,920 --> 00:42:58,020
if it's okay with you, could I get your autograph?

958
00:42:56,590 --> 00:42:58,020
Ah, yes, that's fine

959
00:42:58,020 --> 00:42:59,060
Sorry

960
00:42:59,620 --> 00:43:01,560
Ah, is one-handed okay?

961
00:43:00,660 --> 00:43:01,560
Yes

962
00:43:02,360 --> 00:43:04,260
Are you okay?

963
00:43:03,130 --> 00:43:04,260
It's fine

964
00:43:05,660 --> 00:43:10,400
After this, more obstacles will happen in their urine-holding state

965
00:43:25,050 --> 00:43:27,080
Urine surprise investigation

966
00:43:27,480 --> 00:43:28,820
Moving on to..

967
00:43:31,790 --> 00:43:34,690
What happens if another bystander drops their loose change?

968
00:43:35,560 --> 00:43:36,260
Sorry about this

969
00:43:35,960 --> 00:43:38,060
That's very painful

970
00:43:36,260 --> 00:43:37,830
Ah I'm sorry but

971
00:43:37,830 --> 00:43:40,730
I'm carrying a urine sample, so excuse me

972
00:43:42,770 --> 00:43:46,840
Saito's excuse of the urine sample has let him through

973
00:43:49,870 --> 00:43:52,170
Next up is Ebisu

974
00:43:56,380 --> 00:43:57,850
What should I do

975
00:43:58,610 --> 00:44:00,650
I'm so sorry, thank you very much

976
00:44:01,780 --> 00:44:05,390
He places the urine down and helps

977
00:44:04,450 --> 00:44:06,090
He's very nice

978
00:44:06,090 --> 00:44:07,220
Sure is

979
00:44:07,160 --> 00:44:08,160
Furthermore

980
00:44:08,660 --> 00:44:12,630
the other two also help pick it up

981
00:44:11,130 --> 00:44:12,630
Really?

982
00:44:13,300 --> 00:44:14,160
So kind

983
00:44:14,160 --> 00:44:15,870
Next up

984
00:44:17,400 --> 00:44:20,400
What if the painting on the wall were to fall down?

985
00:44:28,680 --> 00:44:30,280
It spilled, didn't it?

986
00:44:29,250 --> 00:44:30,280
It did!

987
00:44:30,780 --> 00:44:31,780
It leaked out

988
00:44:33,380 --> 00:44:38,150
He spilled both the urine and the glasses

989
00:44:41,790 --> 00:44:43,960
Woah, what is he doing?

990
00:44:43,960 --> 00:44:45,800
It's just tea at least

991
00:44:49,670 --> 00:44:51,170
Um, should I go in?

992
00:44:51,870 --> 00:44:54,300
Following up is Ebisu

993
00:44:52,540 --> 00:44:54,070
Having those kinds of reactions

994
00:44:56,540 --> 00:44:57,510
Go in further

995
00:44:57,510 --> 00:44:58,610
Ohh

996
00:44:57,840 --> 00:44:59,310
Ah, that scared me!

997
00:44:59,310 --> 00:45:01,040
But it didn't spill out right?

998
00:45:00,880 --> 00:45:02,310
Ah, that scared me!

999
00:45:03,850 --> 00:45:05,650
Ah, that scared me!

1000
00:45:05,650 --> 00:45:06,820
What is this?

1001
00:45:06,820 --> 00:45:10,490
Oops, hold on, I got it on my hand

1002
00:45:13,660 --> 00:45:17,160
A decent amount of urine spilled out

1003
00:45:18,130 --> 00:45:19,260
Ow

1004
00:45:18,860 --> 00:45:20,230
What's this

1005
00:45:21,930 --> 00:45:23,700
And now lastly..

1006
00:45:24,870 --> 00:45:28,170
What if the seat inside the medical room breaks?

1007
00:45:27,400 --> 00:45:29,770
Yikes, there's no prevention for this

1008
00:45:30,670 --> 00:45:33,640
Wow WoW WOW

1009
00:45:32,340 --> 00:45:33,740
Ah he protected it

1010
00:45:33,640 --> 00:45:36,310
That was a close one, Doctor

1011
00:45:33,740 --> 00:45:35,180
Ah I'm glad

1012
00:45:36,810 --> 00:45:37,980
Please pass it to me

1013
00:45:44,120 --> 00:45:45,050
Is there any left?

1014
00:45:45,050 --> 00:45:47,790
A little is left, sorry, it spilled out

1015
00:45:49,290 --> 00:45:51,190
Ahhh

1016
00:45:52,800 --> 00:45:53,960
Ebisu san...

1017
00:45:53,530 --> 00:45:54,960
Are you alright?

1018
00:45:54,100 --> 00:45:54,960
I'm okay

1019
00:45:55,130 --> 00:45:57,730
Please take a seat here

1020
00:45:58,870 --> 00:46:00,140
Sorry, doctor

1021
00:46:02,240 --> 00:46:03,470
Sorry, doctor

1022
00:46:03,740 --> 00:46:05,170
This is painful

1023
00:46:05,210 --> 00:46:07,310
I'm so sorry

1024
00:46:07,510 --> 00:46:09,010
He got it on the doctor

1025
00:46:09,180 --> 00:46:10,680
Oh, you're here

1026
00:46:10,950 --> 00:46:13,420
Wait a minute.. what's going on?

1027
00:46:13,420 --> 00:46:16,090
Eh, what? Is this a hospital? What?

1028
00:46:16,090 --> 00:46:18,950
Eh, this wasn't a physical checkup?

1029
00:46:18,390 --> 00:46:18,950
No, it wasn't

1030
00:46:18,950 --> 00:46:19,890
What, come on~

1031
00:46:19,890 --> 00:46:22,960
I didn't eat for this

1032
00:46:23,860 --> 00:46:26,730
I didn't eat since 12 yesterday

1033
00:46:27,360 --> 00:46:32,400
Therefore, if you are holding urine, you are only somewhat helpless

1034
00:46:33,440 --> 00:46:34,700
I see

1035
00:46:34,700 --> 00:46:37,370
You're only somewhat helpless

1036
00:46:37,370 --> 00:46:41,240
This segment, you got inspired from ASKA right?

1037
00:46:41,240 --> 00:46:42,480
Well, um

1038
00:46:43,110 --> 00:46:45,650
Even if they got the hint, it would escape them

1039
00:46:45,650 --> 00:46:48,480
Like if they were told the urine was swapped out for tea

1040
00:46:48,680 --> 00:46:49,790
That'd be impressive

1041
00:46:49,790 --> 00:46:52,150
But, that'll be a Win-Win

1042
00:46:52,150 --> 00:46:55,120
That would be a Win-win, and you would lose

1043
00:46:55,120 --> 00:46:57,890
I'd have nothing to do with that

1044
00:47:13,410 --> 00:47:14,180
Next time

1045
00:47:13,410 --> 00:47:39,870
Check out our Facebook and Website for more Wednesday Downtown! This video was subbed by a community run project called the Wednesday Downtown Project. Thanks for watching!

1046
00:47:13,410 --> 00:47:39,870
m 0 0  l 1800 0  1800 158  0 158

1047
00:47:16,450 --> 00:47:21,220
If comedians are mistaken for strangers, how would they react?

1048
00:47:21,220 --> 00:47:22,720
Hyper Lemon

1049
00:47:22,720 --> 00:47:23,490
Furthermore

1050
00:47:23,490 --> 00:47:25,820
I'm not as bad as this person

1051
00:47:26,260 --> 00:47:28,620
A showdown between Matenrou's Anthony and AnzenManzai's Arapon

1052
00:47:28,620 --> 00:47:32,290
That will determine who isn't the number one entertainer

1053
00:47:33,100 --> 00:47:37,070
Finally, we present a theory on crimes

1054
00:47:37,070 --> 00:47:39,370
that have never been recorded
