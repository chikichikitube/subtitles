00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,020
Subbed by: Mei.ka~

2
00:00:03,250 --> 00:00:08,850
On tonight's Gaki no Tsukai, a battle will determine
who can stay calm no matter what happens.

3
00:00:09,620 --> 00:00:15,930
The First Gaki no Tsukai ya Arahende! Chiki Chiki
The No-Reaction King Tournament~!!

4
00:00:16,760 --> 00:00:18,360
He was pretty loud that time.

5
00:00:18,360 --> 00:00:19,360
Very loud!

6
00:00:19,360 --> 00:00:20,630
He got it together today.

7
00:00:20,130 --> 00:00:20,630
Right?

8
00:00:20,900 --> 00:00:21,900
I bet you could work part-time at a bar!

9
00:00:21,900 --> 00:00:24,070
I bet you could work part-time at a bar!

10
00:00:24,070 --> 00:00:24,670
That'd be nice!

11
00:00:24,670 --> 00:00:27,570
You'd nail that "Welcome!" every time!

12
00:00:27,570 --> 00:00:29,340
So, Matsumoto-san, why are we here?

13
00:00:28,340 --> 00:00:29,340
Yeah yeah yeah!

14
00:00:29,340 --> 00:00:30,910
Today's about reactions.

15
00:00:30,510 --> 00:00:30,910
Right!

16
00:00:30,910 --> 00:00:32,480
Usually, we'd wanna react to things.

17
00:00:32,480 --> 00:00:34,680
Usually, we'd wanna react to things.

18
00:00:34,610 --> 00:00:35,180
Right.

19
00:00:34,680 --> 00:00:36,520
We're told to go above and beyond.

20
00:00:35,850 --> 00:00:36,720
That's right.

21
00:00:36,520 --> 00:00:37,850
People who can do that should be able to not react!!

22
00:00:37,850 --> 00:00:40,090
People who can do that should be able to not react!!

23
00:00:40,090 --> 00:00:42,220
That's what we're here to see.
No reaction? Huh.

24
00:00:42,220 --> 00:00:44,020
There's no way Tanaka can do this.

25
00:00:43,120 --> 00:00:44,020
No way.

26
00:00:44,020 --> 00:00:45,720
No, but recently,

27
00:00:45,790 --> 00:00:46,530
Backstage, he hasn't even reacted.

28
00:00:46,530 --> 00:00:48,330
Backstage, he hasn't even reacted.

29
00:00:48,330 --> 00:00:49,460
That's not true at all!

30
00:00:49,800 --> 00:00:50,200
He's thinking, "I'm a shoe-in for today's challenge!"

31
00:00:50,200 --> 00:00:51,860
He's thinking, "I'm a shoe-in for today's challenge!"

32
00:00:51,860 --> 00:00:52,630
I see.

33
00:00:52,630 --> 00:00:54,900
That means that you can't let anything startle you.

34
00:00:53,330 --> 00:01:02,870
The no-reaction king will be determined based on if they
are able to keep calm when faced with various traps.

35
00:00:54,900 --> 00:00:57,870
No matter what happens, we can't react to it.

36
00:00:54,900 --> 00:00:59,910
We want everyone to see how composed we can keep ourselves.

37
00:00:56,840 --> 00:00:57,870
Not even a flinch.

38
00:00:59,910 --> 00:01:02,870
And this time, it won't just be the 5 of us.

39
00:01:02,870 --> 00:01:06,950
We also have some guests today! Here they are!

40
00:01:06,950 --> 00:01:08,850
Who will they be?

41
00:01:13,790 --> 00:01:21,030
Matoba Koji

42
00:01:13,790 --> 00:01:21,030
Owada Shinya

43
00:01:14,150 --> 00:01:21,030
For our celebrity guest players,
we've invited over these three calm and collected men.

44
00:01:21,230 --> 00:01:23,530
I mean, I'm thrilled that I could come on this show,

45
00:01:23,230 --> 00:01:23,530
Right.

46
00:01:23,530 --> 00:01:27,200
But when this "no-reaction" offer came in,

47
00:01:24,900 --> 00:01:25,430
Yeah.

48
00:01:27,200 --> 00:01:30,000
I thought it was to find the person
with the most boring reactions...

49
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:32,740
Ah, I see.

50
00:01:30,570 --> 00:01:32,740
And then it made me really sad.

51
00:01:32,740 --> 00:01:36,010
So when I came and saw, like, Matoba-san,

52
00:01:36,010 --> 00:01:38,010
I was like, "Oh, so that's what this is."

53
00:01:38,010 --> 00:01:39,080
I see.

54
00:01:38,440 --> 00:01:39,080
But I'm good!

55
00:01:39,080 --> 00:01:40,350
Got it!

56
00:01:39,080 --> 00:01:40,350
Just leave it to me!

57
00:01:40,310 --> 00:01:43,010
You know, in high school,

58
00:01:43,010 --> 00:01:45,450
Matoba was in prison, who knows how many times-

59
00:01:43,880 --> 00:01:45,450
I was never in prison!!

60
00:01:45,920 --> 00:01:47,420
Never!!

61
00:01:47,420 --> 00:01:47,950
Never! Ever!!

62
00:01:47,950 --> 00:01:50,060
Never! Ever!!

63
00:01:48,520 --> 00:01:49,890
I'm just curious,

64
00:01:50,060 --> 00:01:50,360
Yeah?

65
00:01:50,220 --> 00:01:52,820
But did they handcuff you like this or like this?

66
00:01:52,820 --> 00:01:54,860
Well, could I just say this, Matsumoto-san?

67
00:01:54,860 --> 00:01:56,290
I've never been in prison!!

68
00:01:56,290 --> 00:01:57,760
Yup, never been in prison!

69
00:01:56,660 --> 00:01:57,760
Never been in prison!

70
00:01:57,760 --> 00:02:01,930
Well, I think these two were perfect choices,

71
00:02:01,930 --> 00:02:03,000
But for Owada-san,

72
00:02:03,000 --> 00:02:06,870
He can't keep quiet whenever he sees
youngsters with no common sense.

73
00:02:06,570 --> 00:02:07,270
That's right.

74
00:02:07,170 --> 00:02:08,940
Have you given them 3 warnings?

75
00:02:09,070 --> 00:02:11,980
They warned me.

76
00:02:10,940 --> 00:02:12,010
They warned him 3 times!

77
00:02:12,010 --> 00:02:13,580
There's a bit more to it,

78
00:02:13,750 --> 00:02:15,010
But they fought back and uncle-hunted me 3 times.

79
00:02:15,010 --> 00:02:16,820
But they fought back and uncle-hunted me 3 times.

80
00:02:16,820 --> 00:02:18,680
But they fought back and uncle-hunted me 3 times.

81
00:02:18,680 --> 00:02:22,120
There're actually people in this world that get hunted 3 times!?

82
00:02:22,120 --> 00:02:23,990
There're actually people in this world that get hunted 3 times!?

83
00:02:32,600 --> 00:02:44,280
Endo

84
00:02:32,600 --> 00:02:44,280
Hamada

85
00:02:32,600 --> 00:02:44,280
Housei

86
00:02:32,600 --> 00:02:44,280
Matoba

87
00:02:32,600 --> 00:02:44,280
Matsu-
moto

88
00:02:32,600 --> 00:02:44,280
Owada

89
00:02:32,600 --> 00:02:44,280
Tanaka

90
00:02:33,500 --> 00:02:35,500
This is the No-Reaction King Tournament!

91
00:02:35,500 --> 00:02:37,700
The brackets are as shown.

92
00:02:37,700 --> 00:02:40,610
3 traps will be activated for each battle.

93
00:02:40,610 --> 00:02:44,280
The winner will be the one who reacts the least.

94
00:02:45,310 --> 00:02:46,710
Let's get started!

95
00:02:46,710 --> 00:02:51,620
Match one in round one:
Tanaka Naoki vs. Tsukitei Housei

96
00:02:51,620 --> 00:02:54,090
Matsumoto-san, who do you think will win this match?

97
00:02:51,850 --> 00:03:01,430
They'll be checking on the match from a monitor in another room.

98
00:02:52,150 --> 00:02:52,580
Yes?

99
00:02:54,090 --> 00:02:56,250
Well, they're both gonna jump.

100
00:02:56,250 --> 00:02:57,660
So who knows?

101
00:02:57,660 --> 00:03:01,430
Like this is probably gonna be the weakest match, yet.

102
00:03:00,330 --> 00:03:01,430
The weakest!

103
00:03:01,430 --> 00:03:02,630
Well, without further ado,

104
00:03:02,630 --> 00:03:04,730
Let's start the first match!

105
00:03:04,900 --> 00:03:06,870
Battlefield

106
00:03:07,030 --> 00:03:10,640
Enter Challengers

107
00:03:11,900 --> 00:03:12,300
What?

108
00:03:12,300 --> 00:03:14,540
He's balding!!

109
00:03:14,540 --> 00:03:15,140
It's the result of all his failures.

110
00:03:15,140 --> 00:03:16,740
It's the result of all his failures.

111
00:03:15,710 --> 00:03:16,740
Yeah!

112
00:03:17,140 --> 00:03:18,740
Look at that balloon!

113
00:03:18,740 --> 00:03:20,280
That's just...

114
00:03:19,780 --> 00:03:21,210
Very interesting.

115
00:03:20,510 --> 00:03:29,750
Neither of them know when and what traps will activate.

116
00:03:21,210 --> 00:03:24,150
They don't know what's gonna come to them.

117
00:03:22,780 --> 00:03:24,150
Ah, right!

118
00:03:24,480 --> 00:03:26,320
They don't even know if they're fake traps.

119
00:03:26,750 --> 00:03:28,320
I'm interested to see how this plays out.

120
00:03:28,320 --> 00:03:29,750
So much stuff in there!

121
00:03:29,750 --> 00:03:32,160
Damn, this is amazing.

122
00:03:32,160 --> 00:03:33,690
What's with his face?

123
00:03:33,690 --> 00:03:35,760
The way Tanaka's positioning himself...

124
00:03:36,230 --> 00:03:39,860
Get Into Position

125
00:03:38,430 --> 00:03:39,860
This is where it starts!

126
00:03:40,130 --> 00:03:46,740
They'll be judged on whether or not they can keep their current facial expressions.

127
00:03:40,700 --> 00:03:42,270
Yes, just like that.

128
00:03:42,270 --> 00:03:43,270
Now-

129
00:03:42,470 --> 00:03:43,270
Keep that face.

130
00:03:43,270 --> 00:03:45,000
They just have to stay like that.

131
00:03:45,000 --> 00:03:46,740
Right, they have to keep that face.

132
00:03:46,740 --> 00:03:47,840
The first trap is the giant firecracker.

133
00:03:47,840 --> 00:03:49,670
The first trap is the giant firecracker.

134
00:03:49,670 --> 00:03:52,040
And they can't hear us anymore.

135
00:03:50,580 --> 00:03:52,040
This would make me jump!

136
00:03:52,040 --> 00:03:54,910
When will it come?

137
00:03:54,910 --> 00:03:56,550
No, this is just...

138
00:03:56,550 --> 00:04:01,020
Neither of them know what's gonna happen.

139
00:04:01,020 --> 00:04:02,590
Their faces are solid.

140
00:04:01,650 --> 00:04:02,590
Really solid.

141
00:04:02,590 --> 00:04:04,220
Very tense.

142
00:04:04,220 --> 00:04:05,920
Are they gonna be okay?

143
00:04:05,920 --> 00:04:07,360
This is taking a while!

144
00:04:07,360 --> 00:04:08,660
This is so long!

145
00:04:08,660 --> 00:04:10,600
The suspense is killing me.

146
00:04:08,990 --> 00:04:16,230
Seconds until the giant firecracker is activated

147
00:04:12,460 --> 00:04:13,770
3

148
00:04:12,460 --> 00:04:14,730
seconds

149
00:04:13,770 --> 00:04:14,730
2

150
00:04:14,730 --> 00:04:16,230
1

151
00:04:14,730 --> 00:04:16,230
second

152
00:04:23,240 --> 00:04:24,580
That was perfect!

153
00:04:24,580 --> 00:04:26,080
Tanaka got a clear reaction from it!!

154
00:04:26,080 --> 00:04:28,810
He jumped up!

155
00:04:26,850 --> 00:04:28,810
But he jumped, too.

156
00:04:29,810 --> 00:04:31,680
Even now, he's scared.

157
00:04:31,680 --> 00:04:34,320
Well, it got both of them!

158
00:04:33,120 --> 00:04:34,320
True!

159
00:04:35,150 --> 00:04:37,320
It got both of them!

160
00:04:36,890 --> 00:04:39,290
Wait

161
00:04:38,260 --> 00:04:38,920
Now they wait.

162
00:04:38,920 --> 00:04:40,260
Ah, now they have to wait.

163
00:04:40,260 --> 00:04:42,930
Maaan, it feels so tense.

164
00:04:42,930 --> 00:04:44,460
I just wanna say that when we watched it,

165
00:04:44,460 --> 00:04:46,100
Owada-san jumped up, too.

166
00:04:46,100 --> 00:04:50,170
It made you jump, are you gonna be okay?

167
00:04:52,340 --> 00:04:57,640
Get Into Position

168
00:04:55,170 --> 00:04:57,580
They can't keep on trying to see what face they're gonna make.

169
00:04:56,740 --> 00:04:57,580
Yeah.

170
00:04:57,580 --> 00:04:59,080
Right.

171
00:04:59,080 --> 00:05:00,050
What's with that face?

172
00:05:00,050 --> 00:05:01,050
He has to keep it.

173
00:05:01,050 --> 00:05:02,580
And since he has to keep it...

174
00:05:02,580 --> 00:05:06,320
Right, that's why I think Yamasaki's face is better.

175
00:05:05,420 --> 00:05:06,320
Me, too.

176
00:05:07,350 --> 00:05:10,790
Well, everyone, the next trap up is flash cotton.

177
00:05:10,790 --> 00:05:13,060
There's cotton candy beside each of them.

178
00:05:12,660 --> 00:05:13,060
Yeah.

179
00:05:13,060 --> 00:05:16,090
After it's lit, a fire will flare up.

180
00:05:16,090 --> 00:05:17,930
I'd hate this.

181
00:05:16,900 --> 00:05:17,930
I wonder how it'll go.

182
00:05:17,930 --> 00:05:19,060
That's one solid face.

183
00:05:19,060 --> 00:05:21,070
That's a really solid face!

184
00:05:22,100 --> 00:05:23,370
Believe it or not,

185
00:05:23,370 --> 00:05:25,140
He might be the dark horse.

186
00:05:25,140 --> 00:05:26,870
There's always a possibility.

187
00:05:25,700 --> 00:05:29,610
But he already reacted to something.

188
00:05:26,870 --> 00:05:27,740
True.

189
00:05:27,740 --> 00:05:29,610
That's also true, but...

190
00:05:29,610 --> 00:05:31,610
They win if they keep their face, right?

191
00:05:29,970 --> 00:05:37,380
Seconds until the flash cotton is activated

192
00:05:31,610 --> 00:05:32,940
Of course!

193
00:05:32,940 --> 00:05:35,210
But they couldn't even keep it up before.

194
00:05:33,980 --> 00:05:35,250
3

195
00:05:33,980 --> 00:05:36,250
seconds

196
00:05:35,250 --> 00:05:36,250
2

197
00:05:36,250 --> 00:05:37,420
1

198
00:05:36,250 --> 00:05:37,420
second

199
00:05:43,220 --> 00:05:45,590
Whoa

200
00:05:47,690 --> 00:05:49,030
They both...!

201
00:05:49,030 --> 00:05:51,460
Holy, that was so bad.

202
00:05:51,460 --> 00:05:52,560
They...!

203
00:05:55,070 --> 00:05:58,300
Wait

204
00:05:56,270 --> 00:05:57,570
Now they wait again.

205
00:05:57,570 --> 00:05:58,300
But Tanaka really had a voice on him!!

206
00:05:58,300 --> 00:06:00,000
But Tanaka really had a voice on him!!

207
00:06:00,000 --> 00:06:02,710
He was like,"Whoa!"

208
00:06:00,740 --> 00:06:05,710
1 more trap left

209
00:06:02,710 --> 00:06:05,710
Hold on, this must be so tough!

210
00:06:05,710 --> 00:06:07,050
But I don't think they should get to say anything.

211
00:06:07,050 --> 00:06:07,710
But I don't think they should get to say anything.

212
00:06:07,710 --> 00:06:11,320
So that already takes away a point.

213
00:06:08,810 --> 00:06:11,320
Like yelping like a dog.

214
00:06:11,320 --> 00:06:14,190
Yelping would already mean that they'd lose.

215
00:06:13,420 --> 00:06:14,190
I see.

216
00:06:15,250 --> 00:06:18,320
Get Into Position

217
00:06:17,760 --> 00:06:18,320
The last one.

218
00:06:18,320 --> 00:06:21,430
It looks like Yama-chan might already lose that face.

219
00:06:21,430 --> 00:06:21,960
Wait, but,

220
00:06:21,960 --> 00:06:22,760
Just a while ago, he wasn't even trying to make a face.

221
00:06:22,760 --> 00:06:25,900
Just a while ago, he wasn't even trying to make a face.

222
00:06:26,100 --> 00:06:28,670
Well, the next trap is the garbage bin jet.

223
00:06:28,670 --> 00:06:29,300
Ah, in the back.

224
00:06:29,300 --> 00:06:31,300
Those bins in the back.

225
00:06:31,300 --> 00:06:33,870
Owada-san would hate those ones in the back.

226
00:06:33,870 --> 00:06:35,140
The ones slanted in the back.

227
00:06:35,140 --> 00:06:35,840
I'd hate not knowing what was gonna happen.

228
00:06:35,840 --> 00:06:38,710
I'd hate not knowing what was gonna happen.

229
00:06:38,740 --> 00:06:41,580
The best part about this is watching it happen.

230
00:06:41,580 --> 00:06:42,910
Definitely!

231
00:06:42,210 --> 00:06:42,910
Yeah!

232
00:06:45,180 --> 00:06:48,120
I mean, the flash cotton was...

233
00:06:48,120 --> 00:06:49,820
They look so cool!

234
00:06:49,820 --> 00:06:51,160
All these camera angles!

235
00:06:51,160 --> 00:06:51,790
Is he wearing that much theater makeup?

236
00:06:51,790 --> 00:06:54,230
Is he wearing that much theater makeup?

237
00:06:54,230 --> 00:06:57,630
Has there been anyone else in variety
whose worn theater makeup?

238
00:06:54,960 --> 00:07:01,770
Seconds until the garbage bin jet is activated

239
00:06:57,630 --> 00:06:59,100
Why does that matter?!

240
00:06:58,330 --> 00:06:59,630
3

241
00:06:58,330 --> 00:07:00,630
seconds

242
00:06:59,630 --> 00:07:00,630
2

243
00:07:00,630 --> 00:07:01,770
1

244
00:07:00,630 --> 00:07:01,770
second

245
00:07:07,240 --> 00:07:09,210
Whoa~

246
00:07:14,110 --> 00:07:15,910
C'mon, that shouldn't be happening!

247
00:07:17,150 --> 00:07:19,680
Look, he's crying!

248
00:07:19,680 --> 00:07:20,990
This is just-!

249
00:07:20,990 --> 00:07:23,590
I have confidence that I won't make the same mistake!!

250
00:07:25,620 --> 00:07:29,360
End of No-Reaction

251
00:07:27,890 --> 00:07:29,760
Please make your way to the monitoring room.

252
00:07:30,330 --> 00:07:32,030
He's crying!

253
00:07:30,560 --> 00:07:33,770
Man, both of them jumped up.

254
00:07:32,930 --> 00:07:33,770
They did.

255
00:07:33,770 --> 00:07:35,470
We got reactions out of both of them.

256
00:07:35,470 --> 00:07:37,540
Yeah, they both moved.

257
00:07:36,270 --> 00:07:37,540
Man, this is hilarious.

258
00:07:37,540 --> 00:07:38,870
Hamada-san,

259
00:07:38,870 --> 00:07:41,410
Your sadist blood must be running wild

260
00:07:41,410 --> 00:07:42,670
It must be!

261
00:07:42,070 --> 00:07:42,670
Right!

262
00:07:42,670 --> 00:07:44,310
Good job out there!

263
00:07:44,310 --> 00:07:45,780
So how'd we do?!

264
00:07:47,210 --> 00:07:48,550
Who do you think won this match?

265
00:07:48,550 --> 00:07:50,920
You probably were too focused on your own selves.

266
00:07:50,920 --> 00:07:52,080
Those were some solid faces.

267
00:07:52,080 --> 00:07:53,350
Oh, thank you!

268
00:07:52,480 --> 00:07:53,350
Well...

269
00:07:53,350 --> 00:07:53,990
You were able to make some tense faces out there.

270
00:07:53,990 --> 00:07:57,360
You were able to make some tense faces out there.

271
00:07:57,090 --> 00:07:57,360
Alright!

272
00:07:57,360 --> 00:07:58,920
Let's look at their facial expressions in slow motion.

273
00:07:58,920 --> 00:08:01,030
Let's look at their facial expressions in slow motion.

274
00:08:00,580 --> 00:08:01,580
Alright.

275
00:08:10,900 --> 00:08:11,740
This one...

276
00:08:11,740 --> 00:08:12,740
Wait, but...

277
00:08:12,740 --> 00:08:15,570
This one was where they were able to recover fast.

278
00:08:15,570 --> 00:08:18,240
Right. I mean, they did move a little bit, but...

279
00:08:18,240 --> 00:08:21,280
They came back fast.

280
00:08:19,080 --> 00:08:19,780
Tanaka came back fast.

281
00:08:19,780 --> 00:08:21,280
Tanaka came back fast.

282
00:08:20,450 --> 00:08:21,280
Right.

283
00:08:22,580 --> 00:08:23,720
Oh, now this one...

284
00:08:23,720 --> 00:08:25,220
This one...

285
00:08:24,250 --> 00:08:25,220
You could hear his voice.

286
00:08:29,890 --> 00:08:31,920
Those are reactions, if I've ever seen one.

287
00:08:31,920 --> 00:08:33,860
Tanaka lost this one.

288
00:08:33,860 --> 00:08:36,960
Tanaka definitely lost this one.

289
00:08:35,060 --> 00:08:36,960
It kinda caught me off guard.

290
00:08:37,230 --> 00:08:40,060
Yamasaki's good at getting right back into it.

291
00:08:42,000 --> 00:08:43,330
That was just plain bad.

292
00:08:48,110 --> 00:08:51,440
Man, these gay men are so embarrassing.

293
00:08:51,440 --> 00:08:55,810
"Gay men" ... we weren't being "gay"!

294
00:08:51,640 --> 00:08:52,510
"Aaah~!"

295
00:08:55,810 --> 00:08:57,020
This is the best thing ever!

296
00:08:57,920 --> 00:09:03,390
3 producers will judge based on these
3 reactions to crown the winner.

297
00:09:03,390 --> 00:09:04,520
Let's get to it, then!

298
00:09:04,520 --> 00:09:08,590
Was the winner Yama-chan? Or was it Tanaka?

299
00:09:08,590 --> 00:09:10,800
Please present the verdict!

300
00:09:12,460 --> 00:09:16,430
Yes! Let's go!

301
00:09:14,200 --> 00:09:16,430
Yamasaki Housei!

302
00:09:16,430 --> 00:09:18,000
Oooh!

303
00:09:17,200 --> 00:09:18,000
Awesome!

304
00:09:18,000 --> 00:09:19,240
I will applaud you if you don't react to any of these. Seriously!

305
00:09:19,240 --> 00:09:21,140
I will applaud you if you don't react to any of these. Seriously!

306
00:09:20,870 --> 00:09:21,740
Really now?

307
00:09:21,170 --> 00:09:21,770
I wanna watch from over here now.

308
00:09:21,770 --> 00:09:23,340
I wanna watch from over here now.

309
00:09:21,770 --> 00:09:24,980
Your body stiffens up just like that!

310
00:09:23,340 --> 00:09:23,980
Yeah!

311
00:09:24,980 --> 00:09:28,050
You should end it like that but then you just turned into this.

312
00:09:28,410 --> 00:09:29,950
You said it!!

313
00:09:29,210 --> 00:09:30,110
No no no!

314
00:09:29,950 --> 00:09:32,450
You said it!! I heard!

315
00:09:30,750 --> 00:09:31,720
Now that's just-

316
00:09:31,720 --> 00:09:32,450
Like this?

317
00:09:32,450 --> 00:09:33,750
Like this, right?

318
00:09:32,820 --> 00:09:34,890
This is the way to do it.

319
00:09:33,750 --> 00:09:35,390
And then this turns into this?

320
00:09:35,390 --> 00:09:36,890
It does!

321
00:09:39,660 --> 00:09:45,600
Coming up next!
A thrilling match of reactions between Hamada and Zeebra!

322
00:09:47,220 --> 00:09:50,740
Match two in round one:
Hamada Masatoshi vs. Zeebra

323
00:09:50,740 --> 00:09:53,260
Who will this match turn out?

324
00:09:53,540 --> 00:09:57,080
Enter Challengers

325
00:09:57,510 --> 00:09:59,310
Almost there!

326
00:09:59,310 --> 00:10:00,550
They already have their faces on.

327
00:10:00,550 --> 00:10:02,910
Are they gonna be okay with having their faces set right now?

328
00:10:02,910 --> 00:10:04,780
Are they gonna go with those faces?

329
00:10:03,980 --> 00:10:04,780
It's fine for now.

330
00:10:04,780 --> 00:10:05,220
Hm, but I think Hamada-san's a strong contender.

331
00:10:05,220 --> 00:10:07,090
Hm, but I think Hamada-san's a strong contender.

332
00:10:07,090 --> 00:10:08,550
'Cause I've seen Hamada-san spark a
bloodbath many times before.

333
00:10:08,550 --> 00:10:10,720
'Cause I've seen Hamada-san spark a
bloodbath many times before.

334
00:10:09,950 --> 00:10:10,720
Is he though?

335
00:10:10,990 --> 00:10:12,020
I think he's a tough one.

336
00:10:12,660 --> 00:10:16,030
Get Into Position

337
00:10:15,190 --> 00:10:15,790
It starts now!

338
00:10:15,790 --> 00:10:18,060
I've never really seen Zeebra flinch before.

339
00:10:18,060 --> 00:10:20,230
It looks like they're going with those faces.

340
00:10:18,060 --> 00:10:30,240
They'll be judged on whether or not they can keep their current facial expressions.

341
00:10:20,230 --> 00:10:22,130
But those are some good faces!

342
00:10:22,130 --> 00:10:24,670
Very solid.

343
00:10:22,830 --> 00:10:24,670
Very solid faces!

344
00:10:24,670 --> 00:10:26,400
Oh, that's a good one!

345
00:10:25,240 --> 00:10:25,870
Oh, nice!

346
00:10:26,400 --> 00:10:27,940
Zeebra's face is solid.

347
00:10:27,440 --> 00:10:27,940
It is.

348
00:10:27,940 --> 00:10:30,100
He's got it in the bag if he can keep it up.

349
00:10:30,780 --> 00:10:32,510
This suspense, though.

350
00:10:32,510 --> 00:10:33,310
So long!

351
00:10:33,310 --> 00:10:35,480
Their minds are going insane.

352
00:10:34,410 --> 00:10:35,480
Probably.

353
00:10:35,480 --> 00:10:37,320
Like the big red one!

354
00:10:36,420 --> 00:10:37,380
Yeah yeah.

355
00:10:37,380 --> 00:10:39,420
They're probably worried about that one.

356
00:10:38,380 --> 00:10:39,420
Definitely.

357
00:10:39,420 --> 00:10:41,740
The first trap to activate will be...

358
00:10:41,740 --> 00:10:42,660
A blow.

359
00:10:42,660 --> 00:10:44,180
I couldn't handle that!

360
00:10:44,180 --> 00:10:44,700
A blow?

361
00:10:44,700 --> 00:10:48,420
A blow to the back of their chairs.

362
00:10:45,100 --> 00:10:46,060
A blow?

363
00:10:48,420 --> 00:10:50,060
No way, no way will they last!

364
00:10:50,060 --> 00:10:52,300
They're gonna react to this one.

365
00:10:51,500 --> 00:10:53,140
I can't wait to see this!

366
00:10:52,300 --> 00:10:54,900
Their chairs, the back of their chairs will be hit.

367
00:10:54,900 --> 00:10:57,900
They're gonna scream like girls.

368
00:10:57,900 --> 00:10:59,100
This can't be good.

369
00:10:59,100 --> 00:11:00,900
I don't wanna hear that!

370
00:10:59,620 --> 00:11:00,900
I'm begging you!

371
00:11:01,740 --> 00:11:02,780
They need to get ready.

372
00:11:02,780 --> 00:11:03,820
Let's hope they do.

373
00:11:03,820 --> 00:11:04,660
Oh, nice face!

374
00:11:04,710 --> 00:11:06,410
Very solid.

375
00:11:04,910 --> 00:11:06,410
He's keeping it together.

376
00:11:06,410 --> 00:11:08,210
It's Taiga!!

377
00:11:06,410 --> 00:11:11,080
TN: Taiga is a historical fiction drama series that
runs each year throughout the whole year.

378
00:11:08,210 --> 00:11:08,980
This is like the 3rd Taiga.

379
00:11:08,980 --> 00:11:12,150
This is like the 3rd Taiga.

380
00:11:13,260 --> 00:11:15,340
Oh, nice, Zeebra's solid, too.

381
00:11:13,480 --> 00:11:19,920
Seconds until the blow to the seat is activated

382
00:11:15,340 --> 00:11:17,580
It'd be cool if he could keep it up.

383
00:11:16,260 --> 00:11:17,580
3

384
00:11:16,260 --> 00:11:18,580
seconds

385
00:11:17,580 --> 00:11:18,580
2

386
00:11:18,580 --> 00:11:19,920
1

387
00:11:18,580 --> 00:11:19,920
second

388
00:11:25,300 --> 00:11:27,070
Whoa

389
00:11:27,170 --> 00:11:30,900
Alright, we got a voice out of him!

390
00:11:28,930 --> 00:11:30,900
Yup, we heard that!

391
00:11:30,900 --> 00:11:33,710
We heard his voice!

392
00:11:31,840 --> 00:11:33,710
What a pathetic little voice!

393
00:11:33,710 --> 00:11:35,940
Zeebra's amazing!

394
00:11:34,540 --> 00:11:35,940
Zeebra-san's doing great!

395
00:11:35,940 --> 00:11:37,140
Wasn't he, though?

396
00:11:36,240 --> 00:11:37,580
No movement at all.

397
00:11:37,140 --> 00:11:38,240
Zeebra-san's amazing.

398
00:11:38,240 --> 00:11:40,010
Look at that face just now!

399
00:11:41,180 --> 00:11:42,780
Zeebra-san's amazing.

400
00:11:42,110 --> 00:11:42,780
He's great!

401
00:11:42,780 --> 00:11:44,320
It's all over, Hamada-san.

402
00:11:43,740 --> 00:11:46,450
Wait

403
00:11:46,520 --> 00:11:49,260
Waiting for the next one to come is killing me...

404
00:11:51,520 --> 00:11:53,560
Aah, I'm exhausted...

405
00:11:53,560 --> 00:11:55,190
He's already done!

406
00:11:55,190 --> 00:11:56,530
Hamada-san can't take anymore!

407
00:11:56,660 --> 00:12:00,000
Get Into Position

408
00:11:59,060 --> 00:11:59,980
Their backs got hit.

409
00:12:00,580 --> 00:12:01,980
That must be scary.

410
00:12:02,460 --> 00:12:03,980
Can they keep it up?

411
00:12:03,980 --> 00:12:05,860
It's started!

412
00:12:06,700 --> 00:12:10,980
Next up is a shooting from a radio-controlled tank.

413
00:12:11,660 --> 00:12:15,620
Can they keep on not reaction!?

414
00:12:16,660 --> 00:12:17,940
There it is!

415
00:12:17,940 --> 00:12:20,940
They're still fine.

416
00:12:19,700 --> 00:12:20,940
There's just one tank.

417
00:12:20,940 --> 00:12:21,540
Just one.

418
00:12:22,060 --> 00:12:22,780
I see...

419
00:12:23,860 --> 00:12:25,100
What's gonna happen?

420
00:12:25,100 --> 00:12:26,540
And then it turns.

421
00:12:25,700 --> 00:12:26,540
Right, right.

422
00:12:28,020 --> 00:12:29,060
That's cool.

423
00:12:30,580 --> 00:12:31,740
The way it moves is scary.

424
00:12:31,740 --> 00:12:33,020
Very nerve wracking.

425
00:12:35,180 --> 00:12:36,620
He moved before it even shot.

426
00:12:36,620 --> 00:12:38,540
He's already so nervous!

427
00:12:44,080 --> 00:12:45,240
Oh

428
00:12:46,640 --> 00:12:48,410
WOW

429
00:12:53,890 --> 00:12:55,120
Even Zeebra-san!

430
00:12:55,120 --> 00:12:55,520
Zeebra is working up a sweat!

431
00:12:55,520 --> 00:12:57,260
Zeebra is working up a sweat!

432
00:12:57,260 --> 00:12:58,660
So much sweat!

433
00:12:58,660 --> 00:13:01,430
There's so much sweat on zeebra's face!!

434
00:13:00,320 --> 00:13:01,430
So much!

435
00:13:01,430 --> 00:13:03,630
They're probably nervous!

436
00:13:03,630 --> 00:13:04,060
I see.

437
00:13:04,060 --> 00:13:06,160
They must be nervous not knowing what's gonna happen.

438
00:13:06,330 --> 00:13:09,070
Wait

439
00:13:07,900 --> 00:13:09,030
He did say something.

440
00:13:08,800 --> 00:13:10,870
I know, right?!

441
00:13:09,030 --> 00:13:10,870
He did!

442
00:13:10,870 --> 00:13:13,810
He went W-O-W, like "WOW!".

443
00:13:13,840 --> 00:13:14,370
Zeebra's scared on the inside.

444
00:13:14,370 --> 00:13:16,170
Zeebra's scared on the inside.

445
00:13:15,570 --> 00:13:16,210
Right.

446
00:13:16,210 --> 00:13:17,880
That's why he has all this sweat pouring out of him.

447
00:13:17,880 --> 00:13:19,540
No no no.

448
00:13:19,680 --> 00:13:25,320
Get Into Position

449
00:13:21,880 --> 00:13:22,310
Alright.

450
00:13:22,310 --> 00:13:25,320
This 3rd one is the last one.

451
00:13:22,910 --> 00:13:25,320
They must be pretty exhausted by now.

452
00:13:25,850 --> 00:13:27,350
Aaah, Zeebra-san's face...

453
00:13:27,350 --> 00:13:28,420
Did he re-strategize?

454
00:13:28,420 --> 00:13:30,420
Although he is still sweating.
Looks like he has a new plan.

455
00:13:30,420 --> 00:13:32,360
Right.

456
00:13:31,120 --> 00:13:32,360
I'm worried about that.

457
00:13:32,360 --> 00:13:34,460
And the last trap will be...

458
00:13:33,990 --> 00:13:34,460
Yeah?

459
00:13:34,460 --> 00:13:36,360
The giant balloon.

460
00:13:35,330 --> 00:13:36,360
There it is!

461
00:13:36,360 --> 00:13:37,800
After all this time...

462
00:13:38,530 --> 00:13:41,200
Hm, but Hamada-san looks like a red ogre.

463
00:13:41,200 --> 00:13:43,570
His Otoko Ume face is kickin'in.

464
00:13:41,200 --> 00:13:57,080
TN: Otoko Ume (Male Plum) is the mascot
character for the hard candy of the same name.

465
00:13:43,570 --> 00:13:44,640
Yeeeah.

466
00:13:44,040 --> 00:13:44,640
True.

467
00:13:44,640 --> 00:13:47,210
Right? It's Otoko Ume.

468
00:13:47,210 --> 00:13:48,110
He really looks like it.

469
00:13:48,910 --> 00:13:50,340
He only looks like Otoko Ume!

470
00:13:50,340 --> 00:13:51,140
He's like the spitting image of Otoko Ume!

471
00:13:51,140 --> 00:13:52,410
He's like the spitting image of Otoko Ume!

472
00:13:52,410 --> 00:13:54,710
He could make it as a mascot!

473
00:13:54,710 --> 00:13:57,080
In a commercial!

474
00:13:57,220 --> 00:14:03,550
Seconds until the giant balloon is activated

475
00:13:59,080 --> 00:14:00,350
3

476
00:13:59,080 --> 00:14:01,320
seconds

477
00:14:00,350 --> 00:14:01,350
2

478
00:14:01,320 --> 00:14:03,550
second

479
00:14:01,350 --> 00:14:03,590
1

480
00:14:09,830 --> 00:14:12,200
Ah, this is...

481
00:14:12,530 --> 00:14:13,530
This was a good match.

482
00:14:13,000 --> 00:14:14,130
No, it was.

483
00:14:13,530 --> 00:14:15,400
It was a good match, but...

484
00:14:15,400 --> 00:14:16,570
This was kinda...

485
00:14:16,870 --> 00:14:19,570
End of No-Reaction

486
00:14:20,370 --> 00:14:24,540
Let's play back the match in slow motion.

487
00:14:24,540 --> 00:14:26,040
The first one.

488
00:14:25,010 --> 00:14:26,040
That's right.

489
00:14:26,040 --> 00:14:27,210
The blow!

490
00:14:28,250 --> 00:14:29,250
This was...

491
00:14:32,080 --> 00:14:34,920
He didn't get hit, but he acted like it.

492
00:14:32,120 --> 00:14:33,250
This was just...

493
00:14:35,520 --> 00:14:37,460
Like he got attacked.

494
00:14:37,460 --> 00:14:39,420
Zeebra's amazing!

495
00:14:38,060 --> 00:14:39,420
He's too good!

496
00:14:39,420 --> 00:14:40,520
You're amazing!

497
00:14:39,960 --> 00:14:40,520
Seriously!

498
00:14:40,520 --> 00:14:42,190
I actually got the hang of it!

499
00:14:42,190 --> 00:14:43,190
And now the tank.

500
00:14:43,190 --> 00:14:45,160
This was so...!

501
00:14:49,300 --> 00:14:51,240
He just got attacked!

502
00:14:51,240 --> 00:14:52,640
He got attacked again!

503
00:14:51,900 --> 00:14:52,940
What a beating!

504
00:14:52,640 --> 00:14:54,570
He really got a beating!

505
00:14:52,940 --> 00:14:53,400
Beating?!

506
00:14:53,400 --> 00:14:54,570
Man, this was...

507
00:14:54,570 --> 00:14:55,570
He's so beaten up!

508
00:14:55,570 --> 00:14:56,940
Why'd you uncross your arms?!

509
00:14:57,280 --> 00:14:58,080
Nah, let's not-!

510
00:14:58,080 --> 00:14:59,210
Don't they tell you to "cross your arms"?

511
00:14:59,210 --> 00:15:00,580
Don't they tell you to "cross your arms"?

512
00:15:00,580 --> 00:15:02,580
You'd understand if you were there, right!?

513
00:15:01,780 --> 00:15:02,580
Probably.

514
00:15:02,580 --> 00:15:04,450
Really?

515
00:15:02,880 --> 00:15:04,450
I mean, you should cross them, but...

516
00:15:05,280 --> 00:15:07,850
As you can imagine,

517
00:15:09,720 --> 00:15:10,860
Blue, blue, blue.

518
00:15:10,860 --> 00:15:11,860
Zeebra-san!

519
00:15:11,860 --> 00:15:15,160
Zeebra advances to the semifinals.

520
00:15:16,530 --> 00:15:22,370
Match three in round one:
Endo Shozo vs. Matoba Koij

521
00:15:22,830 --> 00:15:26,800
Get Into Position

522
00:15:27,000 --> 00:15:30,340
This art feels so long.

523
00:15:30,340 --> 00:15:33,110
Whoa, look at that stud

524
00:15:31,610 --> 00:15:33,110
A stud, huh?

525
00:15:33,380 --> 00:15:36,010
These are the faces that they have to keep up for now.

526
00:15:35,550 --> 00:15:36,010
Right,

527
00:15:36,010 --> 00:15:39,050
The both of them have such solid faces.

528
00:15:36,010 --> 00:15:39,050
They have to keep those faces.

529
00:15:39,280 --> 00:15:42,720
Well, everyone, the first trap is the rocket punch.

530
00:15:41,520 --> 00:15:42,720
Rocket punch?

531
00:15:42,720 --> 00:15:44,320
Yeah, they're on both sides.

532
00:15:44,320 --> 00:15:45,920
So they did have stuff like this.

533
00:15:45,920 --> 00:15:48,560
It'll fly right past their faces.

534
00:15:48,560 --> 00:15:50,530
That's just...

535
00:15:49,430 --> 00:15:50,530
I'd hate this.

536
00:15:51,500 --> 00:15:53,430
This is...

537
00:15:52,300 --> 00:15:53,430
Especially the punch.

538
00:15:53,700 --> 00:15:55,170
When is it gonna come already?
That face...

539
00:15:55,170 --> 00:15:55,870
Looking' good.

540
00:15:56,030 --> 00:15:59,540
For some reason, if I looked at this face,
I'd end up apologizing to him.

541
00:15:57,340 --> 00:15:58,600
Pretty solid.

542
00:15:59,540 --> 00:16:00,100
You know,

543
00:16:00,140 --> 00:16:01,140
He could use that face in plays, so why doesn't he?

544
00:16:01,140 --> 00:16:03,980
He could use that face in plays, so why doesn't he?

545
00:16:03,980 --> 00:16:05,210
'Cause he sucks at acting.

546
00:16:05,610 --> 00:16:13,850
Seconds until the rocket punch is activated

547
00:16:10,280 --> 00:16:11,550
3

548
00:16:10,280 --> 00:16:12,520
seconds

549
00:16:11,550 --> 00:16:12,520
2

550
00:16:12,520 --> 00:16:13,820
1

551
00:16:12,520 --> 00:16:13,820
second

552
00:16:21,630 --> 00:16:22,430
What?!

553
00:16:21,630 --> 00:16:25,200
They're at a whole other level!

554
00:16:23,890 --> 00:16:24,460
Whoa!

555
00:16:25,200 --> 00:16:25,960
Are you serious?!

556
00:16:25,960 --> 00:16:26,800
This is...!

557
00:16:26,800 --> 00:16:28,200
Holy!

558
00:16:28,430 --> 00:16:29,300
For real?!

559
00:16:28,830 --> 00:16:29,870
This is good stuff!

560
00:16:29,300 --> 00:16:31,000
They didn't react at all!

561
00:16:29,870 --> 00:16:31,000
That's amazing!

562
00:16:31,670 --> 00:16:33,800
Neither of them have shown any kind of reaction.

563
00:16:33,800 --> 00:16:36,510
And even with the flash cotton...

564
00:16:45,720 --> 00:16:47,150
Are you kidding me?!

565
00:16:46,420 --> 00:16:47,150
What is this?!

566
00:16:47,150 --> 00:16:48,850
Man, that's so weird!

567
00:16:49,850 --> 00:16:54,490
Now the third trap will be the dropping of cans.

568
00:16:54,490 --> 00:16:57,500
Now this is where I think they're gonna say something.

569
00:16:56,860 --> 00:16:57,500
Me, too.

570
00:16:57,500 --> 00:16:58,030
Something's up with their nerves.

571
00:16:58,030 --> 00:16:59,560
Something's up with their nerves.

572
00:16:59,560 --> 00:17:02,030
Something's not right.

573
00:17:01,430 --> 00:17:07,510
Seconds until the cans drop is activated

574
00:17:02,030 --> 00:17:06,000
Seriously, I don't think they'd know what to do in a crisis.

575
00:17:03,800 --> 00:17:05,040
3

576
00:17:03,800 --> 00:17:06,000
seconds

577
00:17:05,040 --> 00:17:06,000
2

578
00:17:06,000 --> 00:17:07,540
1

579
00:17:06,000 --> 00:17:07,540
second

580
00:17:18,320 --> 00:17:19,650
Damn, that's amazing.

581
00:17:19,650 --> 00:17:20,920
Wow, that's crazy.

582
00:17:24,290 --> 00:17:27,090
Endo's and Matoba's match was on a whole other level.

583
00:17:27,090 --> 00:17:29,260
So who won this match?

584
00:17:31,200 --> 00:17:32,760
Blue, blue, red!

585
00:17:32,760 --> 00:17:34,430
The winner is Matoba!

586
00:17:34,430 --> 00:17:36,670
Thank you!

587
00:17:36,670 --> 00:17:40,170
By a narrow margin, Matoba advances to the semifinals.

588
00:17:41,710 --> 00:17:47,480
Last match in round one:
Matsumoto Hitoshi vs. Owada Shinya

589
00:17:47,650 --> 00:17:49,610
Don't uncross your arms!!

590
00:17:48,380 --> 00:17:49,610
I'd never!

591
00:17:49,610 --> 00:17:50,780
I'd never do that!!

592
00:17:50,780 --> 00:17:52,050
Never!

593
00:17:50,850 --> 00:17:54,420
Those two didn't move an inch!

594
00:17:52,350 --> 00:17:54,420
Yeah, no reaction.

595
00:17:55,150 --> 00:17:59,420
Just what kind of battle will unfold between these two!?

596
00:18:00,020 --> 00:18:05,860
Enter Challengers

597
00:18:04,230 --> 00:18:05,830
So this is how they're entering.
Oh boy.

598
00:18:05,830 --> 00:18:07,930
Yeah, not looking good so far.

599
00:18:06,700 --> 00:18:10,470
Owada-senpai's face looks like bad news. Seriously.

600
00:18:10,470 --> 00:18:12,140
They must be scanning the place.

601
00:18:12,140 --> 00:18:13,670
Probably.

602
00:18:14,240 --> 00:18:17,110
Oh, there's one new item in the middle there.

603
00:18:17,270 --> 00:18:20,880
Get Into Position

604
00:18:18,410 --> 00:18:20,850
Well, that was fast.

605
00:18:19,810 --> 00:18:20,610
It's a drone!

606
00:18:20,610 --> 00:18:23,750
A drone?

607
00:18:21,580 --> 00:18:23,750
That drone looks scary.

608
00:18:23,750 --> 00:18:25,550
Oh, nice.

609
00:18:24,250 --> 00:18:25,550
Very solid face.

610
00:18:25,550 --> 00:18:28,450
Very sophisticated!

611
00:18:30,090 --> 00:18:32,390
What kinda face is that!!

612
00:18:32,390 --> 00:18:33,720
Why that face?!

613
00:18:33,790 --> 00:18:36,160
He's narrowing his eyes...

614
00:18:36,160 --> 00:18:37,360
So, the first trap will be...

615
00:18:37,460 --> 00:18:39,160
The giant balloon.

616
00:18:39,160 --> 00:18:40,230
They're doing that one?
That one, eh?

617
00:18:40,230 --> 00:18:45,170
This one is different than the one before.
when this one explodes, cockroaches will come out.

618
00:18:45,170 --> 00:18:47,140
I wouldn't be able o handle that!

619
00:18:47,140 --> 00:18:48,540
No way!

620
00:18:49,440 --> 00:18:50,040
What the-

621
00:18:50,040 --> 00:18:54,180
What the hell is with that face!!

622
00:18:53,210 --> 00:18:55,050
It should be more intense!

623
00:18:54,180 --> 00:18:55,050
Right?!

624
00:18:55,650 --> 00:18:57,450
Now that's an intense face!

625
00:18:56,010 --> 00:19:02,420
Seconds until the giant balloon is activated

626
00:18:57,450 --> 00:18:58,420
Totally.

627
00:18:58,380 --> 00:18:59,950
3

628
00:18:58,380 --> 00:19:00,950
seconds

629
00:18:58,420 --> 00:18:59,980
Very sharp.

630
00:18:59,950 --> 00:19:00,950
2

631
00:19:00,950 --> 00:19:02,420
1

632
00:19:00,950 --> 00:19:02,420
second

633
00:19:11,560 --> 00:19:13,860
He didn't uncross his arms, but...

634
00:19:13,860 --> 00:19:16,470
He did jump up once.

635
00:19:15,000 --> 00:19:16,470
Yup.

636
00:19:16,470 --> 00:19:17,330
Matsumoto-san.

637
00:19:17,330 --> 00:19:20,910
Look at Owada-san! He's holding it back!

638
00:19:20,240 --> 00:19:20,910
For sure.

639
00:19:21,740 --> 00:19:24,640
Next up is the drone.

640
00:19:24,640 --> 00:19:27,950
Can they keep on not reacting!?

641
00:19:34,150 --> 00:19:36,650
Matsumoto-san moved to that one, too.

642
00:19:34,490 --> 00:19:40,660
Drone Operator
Celebrity Tani+1

643
00:19:36,650 --> 00:19:39,090
That was definitely a jump.

644
00:19:39,090 --> 00:19:39,760
This is torture.

645
00:19:39,760 --> 00:19:41,130
He's at two jumps.

646
00:19:41,490 --> 00:19:42,160
Crash

647
00:19:49,370 --> 00:19:50,200
Damn, man!

648
00:19:50,200 --> 00:19:51,340
Even though it hit him, he didn't react!

649
00:19:50,470 --> 00:19:51,300
Even though it hit him!

650
00:19:51,340 --> 00:19:52,700
Even though it hit him, he didn't react!

651
00:19:52,700 --> 00:19:54,670
Man, that's amazing!

652
00:19:53,570 --> 00:19:54,670
That's awesome!

653
00:19:57,910 --> 00:20:01,780
No way, no way!

654
00:20:00,610 --> 00:20:01,780
Whoa, he's so good!

655
00:20:01,980 --> 00:20:03,650
This is amazing!

656
00:20:02,750 --> 00:20:03,650
So good!

657
00:20:05,120 --> 00:20:06,950
No reaction there.

658
00:20:05,950 --> 00:20:06,950
Right!

659
00:20:07,720 --> 00:20:09,320
The wind!

660
00:20:09,320 --> 00:20:10,090
So windy!

661
00:20:14,190 --> 00:20:16,160
Ah, this is amazing!

662
00:20:18,860 --> 00:20:20,530
Ah, now it's Matsumoto's turn.

663
00:20:20,530 --> 00:20:21,430
It's comin'!

664
00:20:21,430 --> 00:20:22,900
Look at him smiling!

665
00:20:33,240 --> 00:20:35,250
That hit him square in the face!

666
00:20:35,250 --> 00:20:37,550
3

667
00:20:35,250 --> 00:20:37,550
That drone is just hitting him!

668
00:20:35,250 --> 00:20:38,520
seconds

669
00:20:35,250 --> 00:20:40,050
Seconds until the secret joke

670
00:20:37,550 --> 00:20:38,520
2

671
00:20:38,520 --> 00:20:40,050
1

672
00:20:38,520 --> 00:20:40,050
second

673
00:20:45,720 --> 00:20:48,060
Matsumoto-san -!

674
00:20:45,820 --> 00:20:49,460
Explosion from the wall

675
00:20:48,060 --> 00:20:49,460
I see!

676
00:20:48,930 --> 00:20:50,890
Of course they'd do that!

677
00:20:49,790 --> 00:20:50,890
At the last stretch!

678
00:20:50,890 --> 00:20:52,530
And he's been trying so hard!

679
00:20:52,000 --> 00:20:54,530
He wasn't prepared for that!

680
00:20:53,530 --> 00:20:54,970
The last one!

681
00:20:54,970 --> 00:20:58,170
He totally uncrossed his arms there.

682
00:20:57,330 --> 00:20:58,170
Yup.

683
00:20:58,170 --> 00:21:01,240
Wait

684
00:21:01,870 --> 00:21:04,140
He let his guard down on the last one!

685
00:21:04,140 --> 00:21:05,540
So long...!

686
00:21:05,540 --> 00:21:07,010
That was so long!

687
00:21:07,010 --> 00:21:09,710
That was so drawn out!

688
00:21:10,350 --> 00:21:13,550
Get Into Position

689
00:21:13,820 --> 00:21:15,450
Damn, that is hilarious.

690
00:21:21,930 --> 00:21:24,090
What a face he's got on him!

691
00:21:23,190 --> 00:21:24,090
Very solid.

692
00:21:24,830 --> 00:21:27,730
Up until now, Owada has been the best bet to win.

693
00:21:27,730 --> 00:21:31,070
What will this last trap be?

694
00:21:31,540 --> 00:21:35,070
But Hamada-san, I'm having so much fun right now!

695
00:21:33,340 --> 00:21:35,070
What are you talking about?!

696
00:21:36,040 --> 00:21:41,010
Seconds until the secret joke

697
00:21:37,510 --> 00:21:38,740
3

698
00:21:37,510 --> 00:21:39,710
seconds

699
00:21:38,740 --> 00:21:39,710

700
00:21:39,710 --> 00:21:41,010
1

701
00:21:39,710 --> 00:21:41,010
second

702
00:21:48,060 --> 00:21:51,560
Ijiri Okada Emerges from the Locker

703
00:21:48,060 --> 00:21:51,560
TN: Ijiri Okada is a comedian and impressionist.

704
00:21:50,550 --> 00:21:51,560
Good job.

705
00:21:58,430 --> 00:22:01,970
End of No-Reaction

706
00:22:00,860 --> 00:22:02,870
Please make your way to the monitoring room.

707
00:22:01,130 --> 00:22:01,930
That one got them!

708
00:22:02,870 --> 00:22:03,470
They moved!

709
00:22:03,470 --> 00:22:05,270
Right!

710
00:22:05,600 --> 00:22:07,740
Good work out there!

711
00:22:07,740 --> 00:22:10,110
I told you to keep your arms crossed.

712
00:22:10,110 --> 00:22:12,110
But ours was so long!

713
00:22:12,110 --> 00:22:14,110
Nah.

714
00:22:12,310 --> 00:22:14,110
That's not true at all!

715
00:22:14,350 --> 00:22:15,910
But that drone lasted for ages!!

716
00:22:15,910 --> 00:22:18,180
But that drone lasted for ages!!

717
00:22:22,450 --> 00:22:23,520
Look at him!

718
00:22:23,520 --> 00:22:26,160
Look. Did you see him flinch?

719
00:22:24,790 --> 00:22:26,160
That was just...

720
00:22:28,160 --> 00:22:29,430
Now this.

721
00:22:29,430 --> 00:22:31,600
Sure got spooked there!

722
00:22:31,800 --> 00:22:33,400
But now it starts!

723
00:22:31,900 --> 00:22:33,400
Man, this was...

724
00:22:33,400 --> 00:22:35,630
This was amazing!

725
00:22:34,160 --> 00:22:35,630
This one was - !

726
00:22:35,630 --> 00:22:38,040
That wasn't even fair!

727
00:22:38,200 --> 00:22:39,170
That was great!

728
00:22:39,170 --> 00:22:40,170
They broke their promise!!

729
00:22:40,170 --> 00:22:43,270
They broke their promise!!

730
00:22:40,840 --> 00:22:43,270
That shouldn't have been allowed but that was amazing!

731
00:22:43,470 --> 00:22:44,640
The winds looks so nice!

732
00:22:44,640 --> 00:22:46,040
It hit you.

733
00:22:45,210 --> 00:22:46,040
It sure did!

734
00:22:46,040 --> 00:22:49,210
I thought we agreed that you wouldn't hit us!

735
00:22:46,910 --> 00:22:48,250
It shouldn't be allowed!

736
00:22:49,210 --> 00:22:50,510
I heard'em say, "it didn't hit you."

737
00:22:50,510 --> 00:22:53,120
I heard'em say, "it didn't hit you."

738
00:22:53,120 --> 00:22:55,720
This last part.

739
00:22:59,960 --> 00:23:00,990
Look at Owada-san.

740
00:23:00,990 --> 00:23:02,230
Look, he uncrossed his arms!

741
00:23:02,230 --> 00:23:03,790
What? Owada-san?!

742
00:23:03,960 --> 00:23:05,330
That was a surprise!

743
00:23:04,400 --> 00:23:05,330
Nah.

744
00:23:06,330 --> 00:23:07,030
The verdict!

745
00:23:06,760 --> 00:23:08,200
Of course, the verdict is...

746
00:23:09,130 --> 00:23:10,630
Blue, blue, blue.

747
00:23:10,630 --> 00:23:12,770
Owada-san is the winner!

748
00:23:14,000 --> 00:23:16,440
It was only natural.

749
00:23:16,710 --> 00:23:17,570
But for this kinda thing, actors are strong contenders.

750
00:23:17,570 --> 00:23:19,380
But for this kinda thing, actors are strong contenders.

751
00:23:19,380 --> 00:23:21,180
'Cause you just focus, right?

752
00:23:21,180 --> 00:23:22,080
I did, but -

753
00:23:22,110 --> 00:23:24,420
He became one with the drone.

754
00:23:24,420 --> 00:23:26,050
He became one with the drone.

755
00:23:26,050 --> 00:23:26,920
The drone went more to Owada-san than it did to me.

756
00:23:26,920 --> 00:23:30,090
The drone went more to Owada-san than it did to me.

757
00:23:29,320 --> 00:23:30,090
Right, right.

758
00:23:30,090 --> 00:23:33,620
Was it trying to cut his hair?

759
00:23:34,060 --> 00:23:36,730
Get into position.

760
00:23:37,090 --> 00:23:38,530
Next week...

761
00:23:38,760 --> 00:23:42,370
The first no-reaction king will be crowned!

762
00:23:43,170 --> 00:23:44,540
Trap after trap,

763
00:23:44,770 --> 00:23:47,340
Can they keep up on not reacting?

764
00:23:47,940 --> 00:23:50,870
And the weakest king will also be crowned!!

765
00:23:51,040 --> 00:23:51,810
He's so scary,

766
00:23:51,810 --> 00:23:54,010
He's turning into a girl.

767
00:23:58,480 --> 00:24:00,380
Don't miss it!

768
00:24:03,920 --> 00:24:09,460
There should be a theory that if you're hit with CO2 gas,
you turn into Kitaouji Kinya.
