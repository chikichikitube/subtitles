1
00:00:00,460 --> 00:00:02,780
Fifth time on Gaki no Tsukai ya Arahende Chiki Ckihi ~

2
00:00:02,780 --> 00:00:06,620
Asking the top 3 (hotspots) of a town we've never been to!

3
00:00:07,620 --> 00:00:10,420
This is going to be the 5th time already?

4
00:00:10,420 --> 00:00:12,260
Do you remember the towns we've previously been to?

5
00:00:16,460 --> 00:00:18,900
If we don't remember them, is there even a meaning to it?

6
00:00:18,900 --> 00:00:20,520
We're going to a place we've never been

7
00:00:20,520 --> 00:00:22,760
to remember where we've been to right?

8
00:00:22,760 --> 00:00:23,840
Please tell us where we've been to then

9
00:00:23,840 --> 00:00:26,140
I dunno!!

10
00:00:27,140 --> 00:00:30,840
The destination will be decided with drawing lots!!

11
00:00:31,540 --> 00:00:36,040
1 town out of the 6 prefectures in Kanto, roughly 2500 train stations

12
00:00:36,780 --> 00:00:41,620
Which town will they pick this time?

13
00:00:42,260 --> 00:00:44,120
Is this going to be one I...

14
00:00:44,120 --> 00:00:45,680
Whoa.......what's this?

15
00:00:47,380 --> 00:00:49,020
Kazusakubo?

16
00:00:52,920 --> 00:00:56,630
It's read as "Kazusakubo" apparently.

17
00:00:54,200 --> 00:00:55,320
First time I'm hearing that one.

18
00:00:55,720 --> 00:00:56,630
Where even is that?

19
00:00:56,640 --> 00:00:59,100
Everyone is looking it up on their phones right now.

20
00:00:59,100 --> 00:01:01,300
It's read as "Kazusakubo."

21
00:01:01,500 --> 00:01:04,760
This might be the first time it's mentioned on TV.

22
00:01:04,760 --> 00:01:07,110
Kami is another way to read 上

23
00:01:04,760 --> 00:01:07,110
You might even call it Kamisakubo.

24
00:01:07,110 --> 00:01:10,940
Chiba?

25
00:01:10,140 --> 00:01:10,940
Really?!

26
00:01:11,880 --> 00:01:18,560
Kazusakubo should be somewhere around here I think.

27
00:01:18,550 --> 00:01:22,080
Sorry but I'm curious about your head.

28
00:01:22,890 --> 00:01:25,780
I'm more interested in your hair than Kazusakubo.

29
00:01:22,890 --> 00:01:25,780
Play on words 上 and 髪 can both be read as "kami"
(上 means top/above)

30
00:01:25,780 --> 00:01:28,520
You're more interested in this Kamisakubo?

31
00:01:37,560 --> 00:01:40,670
An hour and 30 minutes drive from Tokyo,

32
00:01:40,680 --> 00:01:43,580
Chiba prefecture, Ichihara.

33
00:01:43,580 --> 00:01:44,240
Alright everyone.

34
00:01:44,900 --> 00:01:47,500
Today we're in Chiba prefecture Ichihara -

35
00:01:47,480 --> 00:01:51,920
at the Kominato line, Kazusakubo station.

36
00:01:51,920 --> 00:01:53,150
I'm gonna say this but...

37
00:01:53,190 --> 00:01:55,540
Besides me, the rest of you guys -

38
00:01:55,540 --> 00:01:58,630
are taking the piss out of Kazusakubo right?

39
00:01:58,620 --> 00:02:00,020
Not at all!

40
00:02:00,020 --> 00:02:03,260
You're all like "what kind of place did they brings us to this time..."

41
00:02:03,260 --> 00:02:05,340
We casually got on the platform right?

42
00:02:07,770 --> 00:02:11,450
The train just left and apparently the next one will arrive in an hour.

43
00:02:11,740 --> 00:02:13,040
An hour?

44
00:02:14,140 --> 00:02:17,600
Every day, 25 trains pass through Kazusakubo station.

45
00:02:17,580 --> 00:02:21,380
A station where around 21 people per day get on and off the train.

46
00:02:22,120 --> 00:02:24,520
In that case, the next question is...

47
00:02:24,760 --> 00:02:27,460
So if it only comes every hour -

48
00:02:27,460 --> 00:02:30,320
we have no choice but to start moving.

49
00:02:29,100 --> 00:02:30,320
That's right.

50
00:02:30,660 --> 00:02:34,680
We'll have to ask somebody who's about to get in their car.

51
00:02:34,960 --> 00:02:36,320
Shouldn't we just...

52
00:02:36,360 --> 00:02:38,660
start looking for a UFO instead?

53
00:02:38,660 --> 00:02:40,600
You're taking the piss out of it already!!

54
00:02:39,230 --> 00:02:40,600
I'm not!

55
00:02:41,100 --> 00:02:44,000
Let's start moving.

56
00:02:45,000 --> 00:02:51,480
Let's find some locals, what encounter will be waiting for them?

57
00:02:52,080 --> 00:02:54,250
This tree right here is pretty nice right?

58
00:02:54,250 --> 00:02:57,760
This tree's presence is amazing right?

59
00:02:58,050 --> 00:03:02,860
So Endo is gonna climb this tree at the end?

60
00:03:02,860 --> 00:03:04,860
End it off with Endo climbing the tree.

61
00:03:06,860 --> 00:03:09,860
At least prepare some gloves for me please.

62
00:03:11,100 --> 00:03:14,970
Is anyone from our staff from this town?

63
00:03:14,260 --> 00:03:17,240
Do we know anyone from Kazusakubo?

64
00:03:18,160 --> 00:03:21,740
As Hamada jokes around, they notice something.

65
00:03:21,740 --> 00:03:26,520
Oh look! A car is coming!

66
00:03:25,720 --> 00:03:26,520
Let's go!

67
00:03:26,520 --> 00:03:28,880
Excuse me!

68
00:03:27,360 --> 00:03:28,880
It's someone from Yakult.

69
00:03:29,580 --> 00:03:33,150
Excuse me! Do you perhaps have some time?

70
00:03:33,960 --> 00:03:37,620
They catch a passing car and ask some questions.

71
00:03:37,620 --> 00:03:40,560
This is great, we probably won't find one again.

72
00:03:41,780 --> 00:03:45,780
There's an advertisement on the car though...

73
00:03:45,780 --> 00:03:47,780
That's no problem at all.

74
00:03:49,830 --> 00:03:53,080
Are you filming for TV?

75
00:03:50,880 --> 00:03:53,080
You'll be on TV like this.

76
00:03:53,940 --> 00:03:56,660
Do you want us to censor with mosaic maybe?

77
00:03:56,660 --> 00:03:58,340
You could also stay like that.

78
00:03:59,080 --> 00:04:01,370
This is turning a bit sexual, can we stop that please?

79
00:04:02,140 --> 00:04:04,460
Ishibashi-san, who works at Yakult, has lived in Kazusakubo for 50 years!

80
00:04:04,460 --> 00:04:08,320
What will her top 3 recommendations be?

81
00:04:08,320 --> 00:04:11,780
Do you have any recommendations for us to go to?

82
00:04:09,890 --> 00:04:11,780
Takataki Lake for example.

83
00:04:11,780 --> 00:04:14,240
A lake?!

84
00:04:12,720 --> 00:04:14,240
There is!

85
00:04:14,240 --> 00:04:16,540
There's a lake?

86
00:04:15,040 --> 00:04:16,780
There is, Takataki Lake.

87
00:04:16,540 --> 00:04:18,140
Takataki Lake?

88
00:04:18,140 --> 00:04:20,040
Can you swim there?

89
00:04:21,840 --> 00:04:23,500
You can't swim there!

90
00:04:24,770 --> 00:04:28,180
I'm not in charge of swimming, please stop.

91
00:04:28,180 --> 00:04:31,940
Could we expect some action?

92
00:04:28,510 --> 00:04:31,940
There are swan boats as well.

93
00:04:32,480 --> 00:04:35,150
That's definitely number 3!

94
00:04:35,150 --> 00:04:38,450
If we could maybe get some Yakult...

95
00:04:37,100 --> 00:04:38,450
I've got more than enough!

96
00:04:38,450 --> 00:04:40,260
I'm doing my delivery rounds.

97
00:04:38,450 --> 00:04:40,260
You're buying them.

98
00:04:41,100 --> 00:04:44,860
As a thank you for her recommendation, they buy some Yakult!

99
00:04:44,860 --> 00:04:48,600
~ Random chatter ~

100
00:04:51,060 --> 00:04:53,940
Thank you very much!

101
00:04:53,940 --> 00:04:57,470
It's been a while since I drank Mirumiru S

102
00:04:57,470 --> 00:04:59,160
Delicious

103
00:04:57,840 --> 00:04:59,720
I used to drink this a lot.

104
00:04:59,300 --> 00:05:00,180
Really?

105
00:04:59,720 --> 00:05:01,640
It's pretty good for your colon as well.

106
00:05:02,740 --> 00:05:06,210
We're swimming apparently.

107
00:05:06,540 --> 00:05:10,380
I'm gonna be pissed if we're swimming.

108
00:05:10,380 --> 00:05:12,380
I really don't care.

109
00:05:12,380 --> 00:05:14,090
Let's just stop.

110
00:05:14,740 --> 00:05:19,280
They'll be heading to Takataki Lake by car.

111
00:05:22,790 --> 00:05:28,070
There will probably be some people at the lake as well.

112
00:05:25,440 --> 00:05:28,070
That's right, we could ask them too.

113
00:05:28,230 --> 00:05:30,330
Will there be people?

114
00:05:28,930 --> 00:05:30,330
Will there?

115
00:05:30,500 --> 00:05:34,240
This place doesn't really look like it has a lake.

116
00:05:34,240 --> 00:05:37,170
Wow!! He said it.

117
00:05:37,710 --> 00:05:41,150
I'm just gonna stop talking.

118
00:05:42,060 --> 00:05:45,070
Is that it?

119
00:05:45,070 --> 00:05:48,190
That's a dam right?

120
00:05:48,190 --> 00:05:51,560
The tension isn't really rising...

121
00:05:52,860 --> 00:05:56,660
You just plainly said that.

122
00:05:57,440 --> 00:06:00,740
It only took 7 minutes to arrive at Takataki Lake.

123
00:06:05,000 --> 00:06:09,440
Takataki Lake is the largest water storage area in Chiba prefecture.

124
00:06:10,380 --> 00:06:16,380
The boat and bass fishing leisure activities are very fulfilling.

125
00:06:17,180 --> 00:06:18,380
Excuse me...

126
00:06:20,960 --> 00:06:22,420
Excuse me...

127
00:06:22,420 --> 00:06:25,590
Is it possible to get on a swan?

128
00:06:25,590 --> 00:06:28,050
How many people are able to get on?

129
00:06:28,050 --> 00:06:29,980
Only four people can ride in the swan.

130
00:06:30,360 --> 00:06:32,950
Three people in one and two in the other.

131
00:06:33,580 --> 00:06:37,200
We would love to see a 2-shot of Downtown!

132
00:06:37,200 --> 00:06:38,780
Rock, paper, scissors!

133
00:06:44,210 --> 00:06:46,530
That was rather bland.

134
00:06:46,530 --> 00:06:50,610
It would've been great if it was the two of Downtown.

135
00:06:47,260 --> 00:06:50,610
That's right, that would've been nice indeed.

136
00:06:50,610 --> 00:06:52,070
That's just what the results are.

137
00:06:52,070 --> 00:06:56,210
Oh, would you like to join rock paper scissors too?

138
00:06:59,040 --> 00:07:02,800
Unfortunately a Downtown 2 shot didn't get realized.

139
00:07:06,500 --> 00:07:10,380
This one is for two people right? The one over there is for three?

140
00:07:09,000 --> 00:07:10,380
Yes, this one's for two people.

141
00:07:10,380 --> 00:07:13,360
You didn't put a camera on the swan?

142
00:07:13,360 --> 00:07:15,700
Why didn't you put a camera on it?

143
00:07:15,700 --> 00:07:19,700
There was a lot of water in them...

144
00:07:20,640 --> 00:07:26,760
The swan boats were flooded so they got on normal boats instead.

145
00:07:25,560 --> 00:07:26,760
Thank you very much!

146
00:07:26,760 --> 00:07:28,760
We'll be going now!

147
00:07:28,850 --> 00:07:32,520
How long do we have?

148
00:07:30,420 --> 00:07:32,520
30 minutes.

149
00:07:33,380 --> 00:07:38,400
Let's set sail for some sightseeing at Takataki Lake!

150
00:07:39,230 --> 00:07:44,980
I don't think I can pedal for 30 minutes.

151
00:07:41,000 --> 00:07:44,980
I don't think I can either.

152
00:07:45,480 --> 00:07:49,030
How far should be be going?

153
00:07:49,030 --> 00:07:51,030
Where the dragonfly is...

154
00:07:51,200 --> 00:07:55,500
Around where the dragonfly artwork is.

155
00:07:55,500 --> 00:07:57,470
Let's head over to the artwork I guess.

156
00:07:58,360 --> 00:08:01,620
The symbol of Takataki Lake, the Dragonfly artwork.

157
00:08:02,500 --> 00:08:09,260
It's a great dating spot, you can make a 30-minute round trip with the peddling boat. However...

158
00:08:10,700 --> 00:08:12,590
How exactly should we be enjoying this?

159
00:08:12,590 --> 00:08:16,100
Are you having fun?

160
00:08:18,040 --> 00:08:20,500
I'm having fun, yes.

161
00:08:20,940 --> 00:08:23,230
Hmm, yes it's... fun.

162
00:08:24,580 --> 00:08:29,680
The old geezers don't know how to get excited.

163
00:08:30,250 --> 00:08:35,120
Alright let's put this engine in full power!!

164
00:08:36,100 --> 00:08:38,620
Their tension starts to rise a bit.

165
00:08:39,060 --> 00:08:43,790
Yeah so... They won't use this.

166
00:08:43,790 --> 00:08:46,890
The director will definitely cut this out.

167
00:08:46,890 --> 00:08:47,780
They definitely won't use this right.

168
00:08:48,840 --> 00:08:51,640
They can't get excited after all.

169
00:08:53,740 --> 00:08:57,600
I'll ask once more but, are you having fun?

170
00:08:57,600 --> 00:08:59,340
What about you guys?

171
00:08:59,340 --> 00:09:01,940
How is it? It's fun!

172
00:09:00,080 --> 00:09:01,940
It's fun.

173
00:09:01,940 --> 00:09:03,440
I'm having a blast.

174
00:09:04,270 --> 00:09:07,280
When exactly are you having fun?

175
00:09:06,300 --> 00:09:07,280
Please tell us!

176
00:09:08,700 --> 00:09:11,620
When the two of us... go forward like this...

177
00:09:11,620 --> 00:09:13,450
When we're going forward

178
00:09:13,450 --> 00:09:16,330
We're like "Ah, we're going forward" I guess.

179
00:09:16,330 --> 00:09:18,320
*same as Hamada*

180
00:09:22,130 --> 00:09:25,660
Alright.. let's go.

181
00:09:27,140 --> 00:09:28,380
Let's head back.

182
00:09:29,400 --> 00:09:33,000
They return to the port with barely any footage on the boats.

183
00:09:33,540 --> 00:09:37,070
Yeah... This is awful.

184
00:09:37,980 --> 00:09:41,910
I don't think I'll be able to forget about this.

185
00:09:39,070 --> 00:09:41,910
This was...

186
00:09:42,790 --> 00:09:47,350
really fun you know, Takahashi (director).

187
00:09:47,760 --> 00:09:51,450
The most fun thing ever.

188
00:09:53,600 --> 00:09:54,940
Really! Really!

189
00:09:54,940 --> 00:09:58,400
Should we get on these ones next?

190
00:09:59,840 --> 00:10:02,840
Sure thing? We'll wait for you right here.

191
00:10:04,880 --> 00:10:08,880
Never mind!!

192
00:10:07,140 --> 00:10:08,880
That was fast.

193
00:10:09,620 --> 00:10:15,880
The boats are a recommendation for families and couples!

194
00:10:17,360 --> 00:10:19,880
As we continue, what will number 2 be?

195
00:10:20,830 --> 00:10:25,740
Well, there's also something that you could do with animals.

196
00:10:25,740 --> 00:10:27,960
Staff: Do you mean Elephant Kingdom?

197
00:10:26,820 --> 00:10:27,960
Yes Elephant Kingdom!

198
00:10:27,960 --> 00:10:29,460
There's something like that?

199
00:10:29,460 --> 00:10:32,680
It's a five minute car ride.

200
00:10:32,680 --> 00:10:38,180
Elephants, camels, giraffes, you can touch all of them.

201
00:10:36,660 --> 00:10:38,180
That sounds like an amazing place!

202
00:10:38,180 --> 00:10:39,830
If that's gonna be 2nd then...

203
00:10:39,830 --> 00:10:42,940
this one shouldn't even be on 3rd!

204
00:10:43,740 --> 00:10:50,920
It's a 5 minute ride from Takataki Lake, let's start moving!

205
00:10:51,290 --> 00:10:54,680
If you asked that lady to hug somebody, she would definitely pick me.

206
00:10:54,800 --> 00:10:57,840
You're her type maybe? Maybe it's the muscles.

207
00:10:58,200 --> 00:11:01,660
I noticed while you were shaking her hand

208
00:11:01,670 --> 00:11:06,140
that she was saying "so similar..."

209
00:11:04,920 --> 00:11:06,140
She said I looked very similar right?

210
00:11:08,470 --> 00:11:12,670
Maybe you look like her husband?

211
00:11:12,670 --> 00:11:14,480
That would be weird.

212
00:11:15,480 --> 00:11:20,220
Those words flew by after taking a commemoration picture.

213
00:11:21,720 --> 00:11:26,020
Looks very alike!!

214
00:11:26,020 --> 00:11:29,220
She said that right? "So similar..."

215
00:11:29,360 --> 00:11:32,690
I really think she might be wrong.

216
00:11:31,480 --> 00:11:32,690
You'd think so right?

217
00:11:32,690 --> 00:11:36,890
But maybe there is someone who looks a lot like you?

218
00:11:37,230 --> 00:11:40,360
Maybe I look exactly like some YouTuber.

219
00:11:41,100 --> 00:11:46,480
You'll find out more about this in the second half of the show.

220
00:11:47,660 --> 00:11:52,920
And thus, they arrived at Ichihara's Elephant Kingdom.

221
00:11:53,860 --> 00:12:00,930
With roughly 90 different species, there are around 400 animals to be seen.

222
00:12:01,900 --> 00:12:08,900
The biggest elephant performance of the country is a must-see!

223
00:12:09,700 --> 00:12:13,600
They'll be taking a stroll as they head to the elephant hut.

224
00:12:13,600 --> 00:12:15,710
They've got a bit of everything.

225
00:12:15,710 --> 00:12:19,220
This slope is way too steep.

226
00:12:19,540 --> 00:12:23,050
It's an American Beaver.

227
00:12:23,410 --> 00:12:27,520
There's the beaver!

228
00:12:27,520 --> 00:12:29,980
Hey, American Beaver!

229
00:12:29,980 --> 00:12:31,880
He's the worst!

230
00:12:31,880 --> 00:12:35,000
He's thinking "an annoying visitor just came."

231
00:12:33,150 --> 00:12:35,000
Are you an American Beaver?

232
00:12:35,000 --> 00:12:37,100
That's an American Beaver alright.

233
00:12:37,960 --> 00:12:40,220
You're the worst visitor.

234
00:12:40,220 --> 00:12:42,890
They're big!

235
00:12:46,200 --> 00:12:48,730
That tail is pretty amazing right?

236
00:12:47,510 --> 00:12:48,730
Amazing right!

237
00:12:48,730 --> 00:12:50,480
How they use it in water is amazing.

238
00:12:50,480 --> 00:12:55,220
They're really close to us.

239
00:12:55,450 --> 00:12:59,000
Hey! Are you a female?

240
00:12:59,150 --> 00:13:02,920
I'm sorry, beaver!

241
00:13:04,400 --> 00:13:08,730
They already feel at home and they start getting more excited.

242
00:13:11,600 --> 00:13:14,660
It can attack with it's butt.

243
00:13:19,240 --> 00:13:20,900
That scared me!

244
00:13:20,900 --> 00:13:24,660
It got a bit excited

245
00:13:24,660 --> 00:13:27,520
(Matsumoto might be refering to Takarazuka Revue here.)

246
00:13:24,660 --> 00:13:27,520
Are you Takarazuka or something?

247
00:13:27,520 --> 00:13:29,520
There's a pony.

248
00:13:31,260 --> 00:13:32,640
Llamas.

249
00:13:40,880 --> 00:13:42,580
As that is going on...

250
00:13:43,060 --> 00:13:44,900
Yikes!

251
00:13:45,770 --> 00:13:47,490
Yikes!

252
00:13:47,700 --> 00:13:51,140
What the hell!

253
00:13:49,200 --> 00:13:51,140
It's the cameraman!

254
00:13:51,140 --> 00:13:55,780
Wait a minute! That one was way too close!

255
00:13:54,510 --> 00:13:55,780
You should know!!

256
00:13:55,780 --> 00:13:57,780
He was being way too frantic, the way he moved.

257
00:13:58,440 --> 00:13:59,780
We all saw him coming here.

258
00:14:06,360 --> 00:14:09,390
They finally arrive at the elephant hut.

259
00:14:09,820 --> 00:14:11,480
There they are.

260
00:14:11,480 --> 00:14:13,790
They're huge!!

261
00:14:16,630 --> 00:14:19,540
They're riding them.

262
00:14:22,170 --> 00:14:24,840
This one is slightly balding.

263
00:14:24,840 --> 00:14:28,280
It's a bit fluffy.

264
00:14:28,640 --> 00:14:30,430
Staff: Is it possible to enter?

265
00:14:30,430 --> 00:14:33,430
You can hang from an elephant's nose.

266
00:14:33,430 --> 00:14:35,220
Did you hear that?

267
00:14:35,220 --> 00:14:37,140
You can hang from an elephant's nose.

268
00:14:37,140 --> 00:14:40,920
That's like a dream coming true for you.

269
00:14:40,920 --> 00:14:42,430
Let's all do this?

270
00:14:42,450 --> 00:14:47,500
Hanging from a nose's elephant.

271
00:14:48,190 --> 00:14:52,000
You mean an elephant's nose right?

272
00:14:52,780 --> 00:14:55,980
They get special access to enter the elephant space.

273
00:14:55,980 --> 00:14:59,380
The one hanging from it's nose will of course be...

274
00:14:59,600 --> 00:15:04,110
This is Downtown's Gaki no Tsukai ya Arahende after all.

275
00:15:07,080 --> 00:15:08,770
This is kinda scary though.

276
00:15:17,960 --> 00:15:19,860
Wow - this is amazing!

277
00:15:23,690 --> 00:15:26,120
Its breathing is crazy too!

278
00:15:26,120 --> 00:15:28,020
Thank you.

279
00:15:29,000 --> 00:15:31,860
Hamada, you try it.

280
00:15:32,700 --> 00:15:36,400
Why me though?

281
00:15:38,140 --> 00:15:41,070
Because you'll never be able to do it again.

282
00:15:43,050 --> 00:15:46,740
Ask it to grab your neck.

283
00:15:47,480 --> 00:15:49,740
Next up is Hamada.

284
00:15:50,240 --> 00:15:51,880
Its power is really amazing.

285
00:15:55,080 --> 00:15:58,090
It's a chimpanzee!

286
00:15:58,320 --> 00:16:00,090
Weren't the chimpanzee's over there?

287
00:16:00,330 --> 00:16:04,670
This looks like a scene from the Jungle Book.

288
00:16:06,280 --> 00:16:08,730
That was scary!

289
00:16:08,730 --> 00:16:10,730
That nose though.

290
00:16:12,540 --> 00:16:15,580
It'll win 100%

291
00:16:16,800 --> 00:16:22,590
Thank you for today's experience!

292
00:16:25,700 --> 00:16:28,820
What is Kazusakubo's number 1?

293
00:16:28,820 --> 00:16:31,980
They asked the staff from Elephant's Kingdom.

294
00:16:32,330 --> 00:16:35,590
If you go in the direction of the dam by the tall waterfall...

295
00:16:35,590 --> 00:16:39,790
...there is an Italian pizza place.

296
00:16:41,290 --> 00:16:45,380
The name is BOSSO if I remember correctly.

297
00:16:45,380 --> 00:16:48,150
That should be pretty close from here right?

298
00:16:48,150 --> 00:16:49,600
Do you go there often?

299
00:16:49,600 --> 00:16:53,110
I've been there once...

300
00:16:55,110 --> 00:17:01,160
It's a five minute ride from Elephant's Kingdom.

301
00:17:01,160 --> 00:17:05,120
Does anybody know what "BOSSO" means.

302
00:17:05,120 --> 00:17:07,500
Buono means good.

303
00:17:09,170 --> 00:17:12,490
Good as in "This is pretty good."

304
00:17:12,770 --> 00:17:15,910
Why would you name your restaurant like that?

305
00:17:16,000 --> 00:17:22,280
It's more like in a modest way.

306
00:17:22,280 --> 00:17:24,610
Like you're not overdoing it.

307
00:17:24,620 --> 00:17:27,240
Let's ask them.

308
00:17:29,600 --> 00:17:32,920
You're really gonna ask them?

309
00:17:34,280 --> 00:17:36,940
Kazusakubo's number 1 spot!

310
00:17:36,940 --> 00:17:41,400
A pizzeria located at the shore of Takataki Lake.

311
00:17:41,400 --> 00:17:45,890
We came back here after all.

312
00:17:45,890 --> 00:17:48,700
Such a fancy restaurant like this.

313
00:17:48,700 --> 00:17:52,780
You wouldn't expect that when you arrive at the train station.

314
00:17:59,820 --> 00:18:03,340
They've got a stone oven.

315
00:18:07,120 --> 00:18:09,290
Where should we sit?

316
00:18:12,520 --> 00:18:16,980
Pizzeria BOSSO, Kazusakubo's number 1 spot.

317
00:18:18,220 --> 00:18:26,580
The handmade pizza's are grilled to perfection.

318
00:18:27,810 --> 00:18:30,960
We could totally end it off here.

319
00:18:30,960 --> 00:18:34,950
We already went to three places right?

320
00:18:34,950 --> 00:18:39,300
All that is left is Endo's intentions, right?

321
00:18:39,300 --> 00:18:44,080
With this show Endo usually ends with something unruly.

322
00:18:44,080 --> 00:18:48,330
Separating from the group and doing something on his own.

323
00:18:48,330 --> 00:18:50,390
Doing something he really wants to do.

324
00:18:50,390 --> 00:18:54,290
That's what the staff told me at least.

325
00:18:54,290 --> 00:18:57,060
That guy over that told me to say it.

326
00:18:58,010 --> 00:19:04,270
That guy told me to tell Endo.

327
00:19:01,440 --> 00:19:04,270
You told him to climb the tree!

328
00:19:04,270 --> 00:19:07,120
This is actually the first time I'm seeing you.

329
00:19:07,120 --> 00:19:10,610
Because he said so!!

330
00:19:11,920 --> 00:19:14,500
Yes...

331
00:19:14,500 --> 00:19:16,500
He said "yes."

332
00:19:17,100 --> 00:19:23,630
What I'm also wondering is who I look like, according to the lady from the boats was saying.

333
00:19:23,630 --> 00:19:25,990
She said that indeed.

334
00:19:27,660 --> 00:19:31,760
What was the true meaning behind those words?

335
00:19:37,650 --> 00:19:40,320
Since we're waiting...

336
00:19:40,320 --> 00:19:43,010
Staff: You can go and ask.

337
00:19:41,540 --> 00:19:43,010
Right now?

338
00:19:43,010 --> 00:19:44,600
Right now is better.

339
00:19:44,920 --> 00:19:48,110
You're not really into pizza right?

340
00:19:49,530 --> 00:19:52,760
I'm actually a massive pizza lover.

341
00:19:53,940 --> 00:20:01,100
BOSSO's highly recommended pizza arrives!

342
00:20:01,920 --> 00:20:07,320
A pizza topped with Chiba's local onions and green chilies.

343
00:20:08,220 --> 00:20:09,900
How will the taste be?

344
00:20:10,700 --> 00:20:13,200
Itadakimasu~

345
00:20:15,920 --> 00:20:20,040
The sweetness of the onions!

346
00:20:20,040 --> 00:20:22,920
This is very sweet!

347
00:20:22,920 --> 00:20:24,200
This is way too good!

348
00:20:24,200 --> 00:20:26,200
Whoever decided to put this on a pizza -

349
00:20:26,800 --> 00:20:28,200
is a genius!

350
00:20:28,500 --> 00:20:30,300
Tasty!

351
00:20:29,410 --> 00:20:30,300
It's delicious.

352
00:20:31,000 --> 00:20:36,600
Weren't you supposed to ask about the store's name?

353
00:20:47,780 --> 00:20:50,110
Buono means good/delicous right?

354
00:20:50,320 --> 00:20:52,820
That's right.

355
00:20:50,820 --> 00:20:52,820
In Italian.

356
00:20:52,820 --> 00:20:55,780
What does BOSSO mean?

357
00:20:55,780 --> 00:21:01,820
It means something like an Italian coming in and using ingredients from the Bōsō area.

358
00:20:59,320 --> 00:21:01,820
Right!!

359
00:21:01,820 --> 00:21:04,640
"Right!!" My ass!

360
00:21:06,940 --> 00:21:09,230
It's a coined word.

361
00:21:12,030 --> 00:21:14,470
Alright, I'll be going I guess.

362
00:21:15,300 --> 00:21:20,880
After this, the true meaning behind those words will become clear.

363
00:21:21,890 --> 00:21:24,400
I'm such a pizza lover and yet -

364
00:21:24,400 --> 00:21:26,610
I'm the one not eating pizza.

365
00:21:27,440 --> 00:21:30,600
To find out about those words,

366
00:21:30,600 --> 00:21:34,060
Endo rushes to the boat place

367
00:21:34,500 --> 00:21:35,790
Dessert pizza!

368
00:21:35,880 --> 00:21:39,980
It's dessert time on the other side.

369
00:21:40,000 --> 00:21:43,420
There's was a lot we saw today right?

370
00:21:43,420 --> 00:21:45,320
Right!

371
00:21:46,410 --> 00:21:49,590
There strawberry in there and yet...

372
00:21:50,880 --> 00:21:53,800
Hama-chan didn't get a single strawberry?

373
00:21:53,800 --> 00:21:57,800
You're hogging all the strawberries for yourself!

374
00:21:57,800 --> 00:22:01,270
Nothing for Hama-chan...

375
00:22:02,240 --> 00:22:06,680
While the other guys are having fun at the store, Endo is...

376
00:22:07,820 --> 00:22:08,640
Good afternoon!

377
00:22:12,180 --> 00:22:16,820
Finally, he can ask the true meaning behind those words...

378
00:22:17,140 --> 00:22:19,160
You said with a very small voice...

379
00:22:19,160 --> 00:22:22,800
"He looks so similar" right?

380
00:22:22,800 --> 00:22:24,760
Who does he look like?

381
00:22:24,760 --> 00:22:28,620
Not similar in a way of looking like somebody but...

382
00:22:28,620 --> 00:22:33,240
He was just like he usually is on TV.

383
00:22:33,240 --> 00:22:38,830
So you meant "similar" as in how he usually is on TV right?

384
00:22:38,850 --> 00:22:40,830
I wouldn't really know who he looked similar to.

385
00:22:41,220 --> 00:22:44,480
That's okay, no problem at all.

386
00:22:45,200 --> 00:22:47,340
While we found out the true meaning behind those words...

387
00:22:48,400 --> 00:22:50,910
They decided to wrap it up here.

388
00:22:50,910 --> 00:22:53,000
We have to wrap it up here too.

389
00:22:52,300 --> 00:22:53,000
That's right!

390
00:22:53,000 --> 00:22:56,640
Ending it off with some food feels pretty good.

391
00:22:56,040 --> 00:22:58,080
Usually it's at the start.

392
00:22:58,520 --> 00:23:00,880
It was delicious!

393
00:22:59,220 --> 00:23:00,880
Delicious!

394
00:23:00,880 --> 00:23:02,920
Staff:  That's a wrap.

395
00:23:02,920 --> 00:23:05,520
Let's go home.

396
00:23:05,520 --> 00:23:08,640
He wanted to go alone after all.

397
00:23:07,140 --> 00:23:08,640
He was in such high spirits.

398
00:23:14,320 --> 00:23:18,960
After a five minute delay...

399
00:23:19,580 --> 00:23:24,080
Alright, we got back at BOSSO.

400
00:23:29,450 --> 00:23:32,260
Huh?

401
00:23:52,080 --> 00:23:53,970
You know...

402
00:23:53,970 --> 00:23:56,130
When I crossed that bridge...

403
00:23:56,140 --> 00:23:59,930
Matsumoto's and Hamada's car passed me.

404
00:23:59,930 --> 00:24:02,220
At that point I already knew...
