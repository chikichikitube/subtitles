00:00:00,640 --> 00:00:03,640
Someday in April, at Nippon Television

3
00:00:03,810 --> 00:00:06,770
At the Gaki no Tsukai Shooting

4
00:00:06,980 --> 00:00:14,590
Regular members and 5 guests are invited

5
00:00:15,050 --> 00:00:18,500
Nobody knows what they're going to do...

6
00:00:18,750 --> 00:00:21,080
Gaki no Tsukai ya Arahende! Chiki Chiki!

7
00:00:21,090 --> 00:00:26,400
Audition quiz! Who cares about the quiz winner? Good Boy Contest!

8
00:00:32,000 --> 00:00:37,260
So, this audition will replace all Gaki members!

9
00:00:38,400 --> 00:00:39,430
Wait, hold up

10
00:00:39,750 --> 00:00:41,430
So it's like this

11
00:00:41,600 --> 00:00:47,100
Downtown has the concept of kindness, we want to be sweet all the time.

12
00:00:47,500 --> 00:00:52,530
We want to be ser-sur-surrounded by good boys.

13
00:00:53,440 --> 00:00:54,530
Ser-surrounded?

14
00:00:56,300 --> 00:00:57,910
Boys like wafers.

15
00:00:58,450 --> 00:00:59,070
I can totally understand

16
00:00:59,270 --> 00:01:00,700
I don't care who wins.

17
00:01:00,710 --> 00:01:03,790
I just want to know who is a good boy.

18
00:01:06,900 --> 00:01:09,790
It's a quiz battle to become a regular member!

19
00:01:10,380 --> 00:01:13,190
But it has nothing to do with the quiz!

20
00:01:14,350 --> 00:01:17,970
It's all about if you're a good boy or not!

21
00:01:19,550 --> 00:01:21,970
The judgment is done by Matsumoto, using these buttons.

22
00:01:22,250 --> 00:01:24,520
Each time he thinks they're a good boy, they get 10 points.

23
00:01:26,250 --> 00:01:30,480
The five who have the highest points, become the new regular members.

24
00:01:31,500 --> 00:01:34,990
However somehow, some of them don't start from zero...

25
00:01:36,050 --> 00:01:37,320
Is it fine if I ask something?

26
00:01:37,330 --> 00:01:37,610
Yes

27
00:01:37,760 --> 00:01:40,070
Umm, why am I starting at -10 points?

28
00:01:40,070 --> 00:01:41,120
Because you're divorced.

29
00:01:42,540 --> 00:01:44,500
And Inomoto also has -40 points.

30
00:01:44,510 --> 00:01:46,180
Why am I also on -40 points?

31
00:01:46,210 --> 00:01:48,800
Because you kind of have the eyes of a thieving cat.

32
00:01:50,950 --> 00:01:54,170
Then why do I have 30 points?

33
00:01:54,180 --> 00:01:57,340
It's because you have such high potential in being a good boy.

34
00:01:59,570 --> 00:02:02,900
But Matsumoto-san, I feel bad for having 30 points...

35
00:02:02,900 --> 00:02:06,620
Could you divide my points equally between everyone?

36
00:02:06,630 --> 00:02:11,380
Tanaka, Good Boy!!

37
00:02:08,950 --> 00:02:11,650
Right now he's doing really well at being nice.

38
00:02:12,150 --> 00:02:16,690
Well then Matsumoto-san, I need to be the best partner for Inomoto

39
00:02:17,150 --> 00:02:20,320
So, I'll also take the burden of having -40 points.

40
00:02:20,920 --> 00:02:25,520
Fujiwara, Bad Boy!!

41
00:02:22,330 --> 00:02:23,450
It doesn't work like that.

42
00:02:24,360 --> 00:02:25,490
It doesn't work like that.

43
00:02:26,100 --> 00:02:27,990
Do you think I'm stupid?

44
00:02:29,680 --> 00:02:33,800
Some of today's guest haven't spoken yet, can we start?

45
00:02:33,800 --> 00:02:37,260
I believe it's because they're trying to be good.

46
00:02:37,200 --> 00:02:37,890
Oh really?

47
00:02:37,680 --> 00:02:39,200
They can't cut into our conversations.

48
00:02:39,690 --> 00:02:43,390
We couldn't cut into the conversation because it was funny enough, it was very funny.

49
00:02:43,430 --> 00:02:45,680
What do you mean by "enough", Hosshan?

50
00:02:48,640 --> 00:02:49,170
Yagi!

51
00:02:49,560 --> 00:02:54,880
I know we're not supposed to take the quiz seriously, but I want to enjoy it too.

52
00:02:55,720 --> 00:02:59,630
Yagi, Good Boy!!

53
00:02:56,310 --> 00:02:57,250
This is good.

54
00:02:57,330 --> 00:02:58,420
Should be like that.

55
00:02:59,140 --> 00:03:01,860
Yagi-kun, your face is somehow stiffening.

56
00:03:03,310 --> 00:03:04,800
You sure are very nervous.

57
00:03:17,600 --> 00:03:20,970
Ok then, the first game is "What's your nickname?!"

58
00:03:26,320 --> 00:03:33,900
People will show up in here, so give them the best nickname.

59
00:03:33,900 --> 00:03:34,860
Alright!

60
00:03:34,860 --> 00:03:36,110
It is just so easy guys.

61
00:03:36,560 --> 00:03:37,440
It's just so easy.

62
00:03:37,480 --> 00:03:40,030
Starting with the first person, come out please!

63
00:03:52,420 --> 00:03:56,170
Obviously this man has some weird stuff on his head.

64
00:03:58,010 --> 00:04:01,500
Give the best nickname for him, without hurting his feelings.

65
00:04:02,640 --> 00:04:04,610
This is a quiz buzzer round, go!

66
00:04:07,010 --> 00:04:07,840
The left hand user.

67
00:04:11,560 --> 00:04:13,170
Uuh, the most advanced.

68
00:04:17,250 --> 00:04:18,400
The ace relief pitcher.

69
00:04:19,500 --> 00:04:22,870
Hossan, Very Good Boy!!

70
00:04:21,150 --> 00:04:22,030
That was good.

71
00:04:22,530 --> 00:04:23,360
Not bad.

72
00:04:24,280 --> 00:04:25,850
Uuh, Mr. Delivering-Lost-Property

73
00:04:27,000 --> 00:04:28,870
It's not bad, if only he could say it more clearly.

74
00:04:32,160 --> 00:04:32,610
Go ahead.

75
00:04:32,860 --> 00:04:33,850
Discovery Channel

76
00:04:35,390 --> 00:04:38,520
Buffalo A, Very Good Boy!!

77
00:04:36,960 --> 00:04:37,700
Was that good?

78
00:04:40,840 --> 00:04:42,820
Now let's ask him what his real nickname is.

79
00:04:43,750 --> 00:04:44,620
It's "Forehead".

80
00:04:47,550 --> 00:04:48,420
I see

81
00:04:48,630 --> 00:04:52,000
Old Man, Very Good Boy!!

82
00:04:54,320 --> 00:05:00,400
Next up is a man whose head is weird and keeps looking upwards.

83
00:05:00,950 --> 00:05:05,030
This man is a little unique.

84
00:05:02,690 --> 00:05:05,030
That's right, a little unique.

85
00:05:06,020 --> 00:05:06,640
Go ahead.

86
00:05:07,360 --> 00:05:08,050
Mr. Intentionally

87
00:05:10,210 --> 00:05:10,850
Not bad

88
00:05:13,290 --> 00:05:14,250
The witness of history.

89
00:05:18,150 --> 00:05:18,650
Go ahead.

90
00:05:18,910 --> 00:05:19,830
The doll of May.

91
00:05:23,530 --> 00:05:24,340
Okay, let's go.

92
00:05:25,500 --> 00:05:26,090
Who should we go from?

93
00:05:27,490 --> 00:05:28,350
A pinch hitter.

94
00:05:29,510 --> 00:05:32,340
Fujiwara, Quite A Good Boy!!

95
00:05:30,480 --> 00:05:31,240
I see.

96
00:05:34,050 --> 00:05:35,430
Academy Award for Best Short Film.

97
00:05:37,020 --> 00:05:40,490
Buffalo A, Very Good Boy!!

98
00:05:39,310 --> 00:05:40,180
Is that alright?

99
00:05:42,730 --> 00:05:44,250
Excuse me, please now tell us your real nickname.

100
00:05:44,800 --> 00:05:45,570
It's "General"

101
00:05:46,840 --> 00:05:47,840
"General"?

102
00:05:49,910 --> 00:05:53,490
Can you tell us the reason?

103
00:05:53,600 --> 00:05:55,950
People at my workplace call me so.

104
00:06:01,660 --> 00:06:03,620
General is younger than me!

105
00:06:03,510 --> 00:06:05,090
Daishiro Tamai (47)

106
00:06:07,220 --> 00:06:10,780
Maybe the nickname is for his huge presence which people around his age usually don't have.

107
00:06:10,780 --> 00:06:14,550
I see, I was really surprised. But thank you very much!

108
00:06:14,550 --> 00:06:20,060
Thank you very much.

109
00:06:21,230 --> 00:06:23,200
OK, now for the last person, please come out!

110
00:06:26,280 --> 00:06:30,000
Ah, I see, so it's this woman, alright, go ahead.

111
00:06:31,610 --> 00:06:36,140
Next up is a woman with big breasts, what is her nickname?

112
00:06:36,660 --> 00:06:38,240
They are big though, aren't they?

113
00:06:37,530 --> 00:06:38,350
They are.

114
00:06:38,500 --> 00:06:39,300
Go ahead.

115
00:06:39,430 --> 00:06:43,290
A woman who wuldvesin is a PV by Keisuke Kuwata, ah would be seen.

00:06:44,460 --> 00:06:46,580

118
00:06:49,450 --> 00:06:50,550
Go ahead

119
00:06:50,800 --> 00:06:53,650
A miracle.. of big melons.

120
00:06:55,900 --> 00:07:00,200
Wait hold up, you guys need to at least be able to speak clearly.

121
00:07:01,250 --> 00:07:01,970
Go ahead

Go ahead.

126
00:07:08,100 --> 00:07:10,270
Woman from 10pm

127
00:07:11,110 --> 00:07:15,150

Not a good boy.

129
00:07:17,400 --> 00:07:20,250
So please tell us your real nickname.

130
00:07:20,620 --> 00:07:22,800

Thank you very much.

134
00:07:35,130 --> 00:07:38,400
The alarm is ringing, what is it?

135
00:07:38,400 --> 00:07:41,260
It's "Macchan's Direct Negotiation" corner.

136
00:07:41,270 --> 00:07:48,310
I'm going to give you the quiz directly, so please answer it quickly.

137
00:07:48,310 --> 00:07:52,400
Alright then, thank you very much.

138
00:07:52,410 --> 00:07:53,650
Is it understood?

139
00:07:52,800 --> 00:07:53,650
Yep

140
00:07:54,150 --> 00:07:59,000
If a puppy was drowning in the river, what would you guys do?

141
00:08:01,700 --> 00:08:03,700
This is a quiz buzzer round guys. Go ahead.

142
00:08:03,710 --> 00:08:06,210
I don't even want to think about something so tragic.

143
00:08:06,930 --> 00:08:09,130
Kawashima, Good Boy!!

144
00:08:07,600 --> 00:08:08,670
I see.

145
00:08:08,800 --> 00:08:09,500
Not bad

146
00:08:10,130 --> 00:08:10,920
Yes, let's go.

147
00:08:10,950 --> 00:08:18,100
Of course I would go save it's life right away, but also scold the owner very badly.

148
00:08:18,610 --> 00:08:22,450
Fujiwara, Not A Good Boy!!

149
00:08:19,730 --> 00:08:22,140
Too long, it's too long.

150
00:08:20,570 --> 00:08:22,450
Too long, it can't be too long.

151
00:08:22,450 --> 00:08:26,120
It's hard to imagine due to the width and depth of the river,

152
00:08:26,120 --> 00:08:28,440
But I would scream at the top of my lungs!

153
00:08:28,690 --> 00:08:32,860
Daikichi, Incredibly Good Boy!!

154
00:08:31,000 --> 00:08:35,950
I really love his courage.

155
00:08:36,450 --> 00:08:37,570
Go ahead.

156
00:08:37,650 --> 00:08:41,950
I would save his life, dry it's fur and then keep it for the rest of it's life.

00:08:42,770 --> 00:08:46,440
Yagi, Very Good Boy!!

158
00:08:47,080 --> 00:08:50,610
He would keep the puppy for the rest of it's life. That's wonderful isn't it?

159
00:08:51,400 --> 00:08:53,950
Now for a different question.

160
00:08:54,900 --> 00:08:57,750
Please sing us a Good Boy Song~

161
00:08:59,500 --> 00:09:02,300
The theme is to sing a Good Boy Song.

162
00:09:01,350 --> 00:09:02,290
I see.

163
00:09:02,740 --> 00:09:03,290
Yes, go ahead.

164
00:09:03,290 --> 00:09:04,200
Yes, Yamazaki-san

165
00:09:05,200 --> 00:09:10,000
Mother, thank you

166
00:09:10,370 --> 00:09:18,750
And Father, for working so hard for us, thank you.

167
00:09:17,800 --> 00:09:22,970
Yamasaki, Very Good Boy!!

168
00:09:20,550 --> 00:09:25,510
A very good boy. Wonderful. Really good.

169
00:09:25,520 --> 00:09:27,540
Was that really an improvisation?

170
00:09:29,200 --> 00:09:31,550
Makes your heart flutter, doesn't it?

171
00:09:30,000 --> 00:09:31,790
Let's get on with it.

172
00:09:32,100 --> 00:09:32,580
Go ahead.

173
00:09:32,580 --> 00:09:33,630
Yagi-kun go ahead.

174
00:09:33,950 --> 00:09:39,000
Go home~ When you come home from outside

175
00:09:39,010 --> 00:09:42,750
You should wushyohinds (Wash your hands)

176
00:09:43,700 --> 00:09:45,030
What the?

177
00:09:45,400 --> 00:09:49,630
Yagi, Incredibly Bad Boy!!

178
00:09:46,400 --> 00:09:47,900
What the hell?

179
00:09:47,900 --> 00:09:51,600
What the hell is he saying? We don't understand him.

180
00:09:51,600 --> 00:09:54,560
The beginning was also hard to listen to.

181
00:09:55,100 --> 00:09:58,480
Not being able to say what you want, is also part of being a good boy?

182
00:09:59,800 --> 00:10:04,420
All of them have gained some points, now we are heading towards the next game.

183
00:10:04,900 --> 00:10:07,950
What is inside the box?!

184
00:10:15,500 --> 00:10:18,750
This game also has nothing to do with whether or not you're correct.

185
00:10:18,760 --> 00:10:22,100
It's all about whether or not you're a good boy!

186
00:10:23,400 --> 00:10:25,800
First up, Yamasaki takes on the challenge.

187
00:10:26,850 --> 00:10:31,600
The others members have a chance to show their goodness during Yamasaki's try.

188
00:10:32,200 --> 00:10:33,650
Please take care.

189
00:10:33,740 --> 00:10:35,200
Please take care.

190
00:10:35,800 --> 00:10:40,400
You guys don't need to cheer me on so much, it's not good for your throats.

191
00:10:41,540 --> 00:10:45,390
OK, let's move on, the first challenge is this one!

192
00:10:47,750 --> 00:10:49,420
Please stop, please stop.

193
00:10:49,430 --> 00:10:50,750
This is a bit...

194
00:10:50,120 --> 00:10:51,870
Please take care.

195
00:10:50,950 --> 00:10:53,870
Please be careful.

196
00:10:51,870 --> 00:10:54,000
Really please be careful, you could get injured.

197
00:10:54,100 --> 00:10:58,990
Hamada-san should also be careful, his hand might hurt you.

198
00:10:59,000 --> 00:11:00,500
What do you mean? What do you mean? Hamada?

199
00:11:00,500 --> 00:11:03,400
Ah, it's just that I thought Hosei-san's hand would be dangerous for Hamada-san.

200
00:11:03,410 --> 00:11:04,300
I see.

201
00:11:04,310 --> 00:11:07,680
Endo, Good Boy!!

202
00:11:06,050 --> 00:11:08,400
I really love your care for Hamada.

203
00:11:08,500 --> 00:11:11,680
I'll be very careful with my hands, so that you don't get hit.

204
00:11:11,960 --> 00:11:17,000
We've talked enough about hands, let's move on, enough of Hamada's care.

205
00:11:17,250 --> 00:11:18,730
I'll do it slowly

206
00:11:17,750 --> 00:11:18,720
Let's go slowly.

207
00:11:18,800 --> 00:11:22,350
Wow, I really appreciate the staff. Thank you, this box is really soft.

208
00:11:24,100 --> 00:11:25,040
What do you mean?

209
00:11:25,030 --> 00:11:26,740
The place where he puts his hand in

210
00:11:26,740 --> 00:11:28,420
That was really nice of you to notice.

211
00:11:28,430 --> 00:11:30,750
This really is super soft!

212
00:11:30,760 --> 00:11:32,700
Who made this? Thank you very much.

213
00:11:32,700 --> 00:11:34,100
Move on, move on.

214
00:11:35,660 --> 00:11:37,840
Why doesn't he give me any points?

215
00:11:37,850 --> 00:11:39,630
It's alright, it's alright, let's move on.

216
00:11:41,920 --> 00:11:44,970
Woah, he doesn't show any hesitation!

217
00:11:47,500 --> 00:11:48,950
Is it alright (to answer)?

218
00:11:48,290 --> 00:11:49,190
It's alright

219
00:11:48,950 --> 00:11:50,010
You know it?

220
00:11:50,700 --> 00:11:53,960
I really appreciate all the staff, thank you very much, the answer is 6 scrubbing brushes.

221
00:11:53,960 --> 00:11:57,290
Yamasaki, Bad Boy!!

222
00:11:57,400 --> 00:12:00,550
You didn't speak clearly, again.

223
00:12:00,130 --> 00:12:02,230
You can't do that, right?

224
00:12:00,700 --> 00:12:03,730
I did want to give you points

225
00:12:03,750 --> 00:12:04,800
Sorry.

226
00:12:04,800 --> 00:12:06,300
Ah, sorry for this.

227
00:12:06,450 --> 00:12:10,960
Right now did you guys see how Hamada-san showed me the way back to my place?

228
00:12:10,940 --> 00:12:13,310
Then what kind of feeling did you get from Hamada?

229
00:12:13,310 --> 00:12:15,880
I'm just... Thank you!

230
00:12:16,500 --> 00:12:19,050
Yes, there is such a thing.

231
00:12:20,850 --> 00:12:26,090
Well done. Good job.

232
00:12:26,800 --> 00:12:29,090
Next up, Hosshan takes the challenge.

233
00:12:29,500 --> 00:12:31,400
Is it.. ok for me to go?

234
00:12:30,400 --> 00:12:31,900
Yes. It's fine. Go ahead.

235
00:12:31,910 --> 00:12:34,760
The tape, be aware of the tape.

236
00:12:33,170 --> 00:12:34,990
In case there isn't any left.

237
00:12:35,050 --> 00:12:38,100
Oh camera crew. You guys don't need to film me if the tape is running out.

238
00:12:37,900 --> 00:12:41,910
Hosshan, Quite A Good Boy!!

239
00:12:39,150 --> 00:12:41,900
That's really good, he's a good boy.

240
00:12:42,100 --> 00:12:44,300
Here is what's inside of the next box!

241
00:12:47,500 --> 00:12:49,280
Hold up. This is a bit...

242
00:12:48,500 --> 00:12:49,850
This is..

243
00:12:49,300 --> 00:12:50,280
This is..

244
00:12:50,400 --> 00:12:51,550
Please really take care. Take care. Be careful!

245
00:12:53,950 --> 00:12:56,350
Go slowly. Do it slowly. Be careful. Take care.

246
00:12:56,350 --> 00:13:00,380
The lid of the box.. it's not the same as before.

247
00:12:59,720 --> 00:13:00,390
That's right.

248
00:13:00,390 --> 00:13:03,450
Once the inside has been changed, the lid has also got to be changed.

249
00:13:03,460 --> 00:13:05,500
Should go from this side? This side?

250
00:13:07,500 --> 00:13:10,400
Hosshan, Not A Good Boy!!

251
00:13:09,500 --> 00:13:10,600
Is that scary?

252
00:13:10,600 --> 00:13:12,950
Good boys don't do this when they're scared.

253
00:13:13,360 --> 00:13:17,050
I was trying to get in, but it was already there, so...

254
00:13:17,200 --> 00:13:18,700
Either way, I'm sorry.

255
00:13:17,650 --> 00:13:18,710
Do it nicely.

256
00:13:18,710 --> 00:13:19,610
I'm fine.

257
00:13:21,700 --> 00:13:25,600
It's a living thing. Be careful. Do it nicely. Do your best.

258
00:13:26,650 --> 00:13:28,420
It's coming out.

259
00:13:28,420 --> 00:13:30,370
Right now you can't look at your hands.

260
00:13:31,190 --> 00:13:33,710
It came out! Just now.

261
00:13:32,350 --> 00:13:33,820
Look from this side.

262
00:13:33,820 --> 00:13:35,320
Don't look at it. Look away.

263
00:13:36,250 --> 00:13:38,200
Ow ow ow ow ow it hurts.

264
00:13:38,210 --> 00:13:38,700
Did it hurt?

265
00:13:38,710 --> 00:13:40,090
It doesn't hurt.

266
00:13:38,930 --> 00:13:40,230
Did it bite you?

267
00:13:40,400 --> 00:13:41,800
It bit me.

268
00:13:41,800 --> 00:13:43,390
Are you serious?

269
00:13:42,240 --> 00:13:44,200
Yes, like a person would do.

270
00:13:44,850 --> 00:13:46,600
How was it? Did you figure it out?

271
00:13:46,840 --> 00:13:48,900
I know it's a living thing.

272
00:13:47,900 --> 00:13:48,900
I see.

273
00:13:49,300 --> 00:13:51,800
Then the answer is one of the living things.

274
00:13:52,750 --> 00:13:53,800
That's fine.

275
00:13:53,920 --> 00:13:58,000
Excuse me! The answer he gave just now, could you take it as correct?

276
00:13:58,350 --> 00:13:59,410
What do you mean?

277
00:13:59,410 --> 00:14:00,600
Because..

278
00:14:00,600 --> 00:14:03,100
..what he's trying to say is korret, right?

279
00:14:03,110 --> 00:14:05,050
Is correct, right?

280
00:14:07,250 --> 00:14:10,760
What's wrong with this guy? He's weird today.

281
00:14:11,400 --> 00:14:13,760
Next up, Kawashima from Kirin

282
00:14:14,180 --> 00:14:15,550
Be careful.

283
00:14:15,750 --> 00:14:16,600
Be careful.

284
00:14:16,600 --> 00:14:20,700
Ok let's go, this is what's inside the box!

285
00:14:24,350 --> 00:14:27,200
So, Kawashima, what's inside the box

286
00:14:28,900 --> 00:14:30,550
Wait, this is...

287
00:14:32,200 --> 00:14:32,800
Excuse me...

288
00:14:32,800 --> 00:14:34,800
Woah. Is this ok?

289
00:14:35,000 --> 00:14:39,500
He's doing this just to be good. He's doing this just for goodness.

290
00:14:38,160 --> 00:14:40,420
Kawashima, Good Boy!!

291
00:14:39,510 --> 00:14:42,260
Right now, he still hasn't made contact.

292
00:14:41,300 --> 00:14:42,260
Yep

293
00:14:42,340 --> 00:14:47,500
Smile. Do it nicely. Nicely. It's living.

294
00:14:47,500 --> 00:14:49,900
Use the back of your hand. The back is good.

295
00:14:50,050 --> 00:14:51,500
That's great.

296
00:14:51,950 --> 00:14:55,700
Smile! Keep smiling! Smile!

297
00:14:55,700 --> 00:14:58,550
I kind of feel like you're not a good boy.

298
00:14:57,210 --> 00:14:58,140
That's right.

299
00:14:58,150 --> 00:14:59,750
You should smile!

300
00:14:58,900 --> 00:14:59,850
Your gaze is a bit..

301
00:14:59,840 --> 00:15:01,300
It has wrinkles on it.

302
00:15:01,750 --> 00:15:04,860
That's good. Good!

303
00:15:04,870 --> 00:15:07,510
Maybe you should try picking them up from the bottom once.

304
00:15:08,250 --> 00:15:13,300
That's good. Yeah, like that!

305
00:15:16,200 --> 00:15:18,650
Just hurry up and let them bite your fingers.

306
00:15:19,260 --> 00:15:22,070
Hamada, Not A Good Boy!!

307
00:15:23,400 --> 00:15:30,100
These snakes are usually very dangerous, but today they are harmless.

308
00:15:30,870 --> 00:15:35,980
How will Kawashima handle this hopeless situation by being a good boy?

309
00:15:36,690 --> 00:15:42,100
Umm, can I look inside and let them bite me myself?

310
00:15:41,790 --> 00:15:42,120
Kawashima, Good Boy!!

311
00:15:42,290 --> 00:15:44,190
Kawashima, Good Boy!!

312
00:15:44,050 --> 00:15:47,340
It's coming out. No way. Don't. It's coming out.

313
00:15:47,550 --> 00:15:50,060
So this, this was inside the box?

314
00:15:48,540 --> 00:15:50,050
That's right.

315
00:15:50,100 --> 00:15:51,650
Then Kawashima-kun, you're going to do it by yourself?

316
00:15:51,660 --> 00:15:52,450
By myself.

317
00:15:53,200 --> 00:15:56,800
Err.. he's using the slide door now.

318
00:15:58,840 --> 00:16:02,230
He's grabbing the snake like it's nothing.

319
00:16:03,000 --> 00:16:05,820
That's good. It's ok. That's good.

320
00:16:06,680 --> 00:16:07,260
Kawashima, Good Boy!!

321
00:16:07,440 --> 00:16:08,000
Kawashima, Good Boy!!

322
00:16:08,160 --> 00:16:08,800
Kawashima, Good Boy!!

323
00:16:08,350 --> 00:16:09,780
Woah, awesome! Cool!

324
00:16:09,000 --> 00:16:09,500
Kawashima, Good Boy!!

325
00:16:09,700 --> 00:16:10,400
Kawashima, Good Boy!!

326
00:16:10,700 --> 00:16:12,400
Kawashima, Good Boy!!

327
00:16:12,600 --> 00:16:14,200
Wow...

328
00:16:14,800 --> 00:16:18,540
Woah, that was amazing. No way.

329
00:16:19,600 --> 00:16:23,900
Now, should we ask him, what is the correct answer?

330
00:16:23,930 --> 00:16:25,600
I don't know what the right answer is.

331
00:16:25,960 --> 00:16:26,460
Kawashima, Good Boy!!

332
00:16:26,630 --> 00:16:27,160
Kawashima, Good Boy!!

333
00:16:27,330 --> 00:16:28,800
Kawashima, Good Boy!!

334
00:16:29,370 --> 00:16:33,970
Kawashima, Incredibly Good Boy!!

335
00:16:32,800 --> 00:16:34,950
That was amazing.

336
00:16:34,950 --> 00:16:39,200
That was awesome. Amazing. Good job.

337
00:16:39,210 --> 00:16:44,900
It's my first time seeing someone taking such care of what's inside the box.

338
00:16:44,780 --> 00:16:49,850
Putting a plaster on.

339
00:16:45,150 --> 00:16:47,600
Let me do it for you. No it's fine.

340
00:16:47,580 --> 00:16:48,700
Give it, give it.

341
00:16:48,710 --> 00:16:50,850
I want to wear it just once.

342
00:16:51,620 --> 00:16:53,020
Buffalo A, Quite A Good Boy!!

343
00:16:53,190 --> 00:16:55,060
Buffalo A, Very Good Boy!!

344
00:16:55,230 --> 00:16:58,730
Buffalo A, Incredibly Good Boy!!

345
00:16:59,700 --> 00:17:00,900
What if they have poison?

346
00:17:00,900 --> 00:17:03,350
They don't have poison so it's fine.

347
00:17:02,600 --> 00:17:04,770
Kawashima, Quite A Good Boy!!

348
00:17:03,600 --> 00:17:08,000
Excuse me, isn't that camera heavy? I'll take it for you.

349
00:17:07,000 --> 00:17:07,970
Endo, Very Good Boy!!

350
00:17:08,140 --> 00:17:09,370
Endo, Very Good Boy!!

351
00:17:09,540 --> 00:17:10,910
Endo, Very Good Boy!!

352
00:17:11,080 --> 00:17:12,340
Endo, Very Good Boy!!

353
00:17:12,510 --> 00:17:14,110
Endo, Very Good Boy!!

354
00:17:14,280 --> 00:17:15,610
Endo, Very Good Boy!!

355
00:17:15,780 --> 00:17:17,480
Endo, Incredibly Good Boy!!

356
00:17:17,650 --> 00:17:18,750
Endo, Incredibly Good Boy!!

357
00:17:18,450 --> 00:17:22,280
ENOUGH!!!

358
00:17:22,690 --> 00:17:25,270
Go back to your places quickly.

359
00:17:25,300 --> 00:17:26,000
Are you ok?

360
00:17:29,600 --> 00:17:32,990
The next game is Intro Quiz!

361
00:17:37,200 --> 00:17:38,900
The rules are simple.

362
00:17:38,900 --> 00:17:45,540
As soon as you figure out a song name, go get the ping pong ball, go to the mic and sing.

363
00:17:47,000 --> 00:17:51,940
Those who aren't playing should give good boy comments to gain points in between.

364
00:17:52,700 --> 00:17:56,400
OK, let's go, Intro Quiz!

365
00:17:56,380 --> 00:18:05,690
* This song was Hamada's hit song when he was young called WOW WAR TONIGHT

366
00:17:58,760 --> 00:18:05,690
Ah this is. Oh it's this. It's really this.

367
00:18:06,250 --> 00:18:08,850
What's wrong? Who's going to sing?

368
00:18:08,980 --> 00:18:10,200
Do you know it?

369
00:18:09,150 --> 00:18:11,280
I kn- Yes.

370
00:18:11,900 --> 00:18:12,930
He's got it.

371
00:18:20,250 --> 00:18:21,540
Oh no.

372
00:18:23,400 --> 00:18:25,150
What's wrong? Huh? What's happening?

373
00:18:25,150 --> 00:18:29,340
What's wrong?

374
00:18:25,610 --> 00:18:29,950
Wrong Answer

375
00:18:29,340 --> 00:18:34,500
I'm sorry, I knew the song but I'm not great enough to sing this song.

376
00:18:34,230 --> 00:18:40,870
Inomoto, Incredibly Bad Boy!!

377
00:18:37,190 --> 00:18:38,950
Bad?

378
00:18:40,260 --> 00:18:43,500
In that situation, you should have sung the song.

379
00:18:42,500 --> 00:18:43,500
I see.

380
00:18:43,830 --> 00:18:46,000
Second Round

381
00:18:46,300 --> 00:18:49,600
Let's start the next song, Intro Quiz!

382
00:18:51,450 --> 00:18:52,700
Ah, it's this.

383
00:18:53,400 --> 00:18:54,200
Ah, it's this.

384
00:18:54,400 --> 00:18:56,800
Is it ok? OK.

385
00:18:57,150 --> 00:18:58,800
Are you ok?

386
00:18:58,000 --> 00:18:59,000
Sorry...

387
00:18:59,700 --> 00:19:02,700
I'm sorry for the next person who touches this.

388
00:19:09,600 --> 00:19:15,650
* He's singing a very famous song from a High School Drama

389
00:19:15,400 --> 00:19:16,750
What's wrong, Hosshan?

390
00:19:16,050 --> 00:19:17,850
Please do your best.

391
00:19:17,200 --> 00:19:18,430
Please do your best!

392
00:19:18,430 --> 00:19:19,500
What's going on Hosshan?

393
00:19:18,930 --> 00:19:20,040
I'm sorry!

394
00:19:20,440 --> 00:19:24,610
Wrong Answer

395
00:19:21,650 --> 00:19:24,870
What's happened Hosshan? You were nearly there.

396
00:19:24,870 --> 00:19:29,300
This song REALLY reminded me of the drama.

397
00:19:30,400 --> 00:19:33,250
The scenery from the drama made me cry.

398
00:19:32,820 --> 00:19:34,720
Hosshan, Incredibly Good Boy!!

399
00:19:33,950 --> 00:19:35,300
I'm sorry.

400
00:19:34,890 --> 00:19:38,120
Hosshan, Very Good Boy!!

401
00:19:36,200 --> 00:19:37,650
I'm sorry for this.

402
00:19:37,650 --> 00:19:39,700
Good job. You did well.

403
00:19:40,750 --> 00:19:41,950
What's wrong Yamazaki?

404
00:19:41,960 --> 00:19:45,010
His tears made me cry.

405
00:19:45,150 --> 00:19:46,700
So ugly!

406
00:19:46,730 --> 00:19:48,730
Yamasaki, Very Good Boy!!

407
00:19:48,730 --> 00:19:51,070
Third Round

408
00:19:51,150 --> 00:19:54,000
Let's go, Intro Quiz!

409
00:19:57,200 --> 00:19:59,350
I know this song.

410
00:20:02,220 --> 00:20:04,100
Ah he's got it.

411
00:20:17,560 --> 00:20:20,760
Endo, Incredibly Bad Boy!!

412
00:20:20,500 --> 00:20:21,500
What's going on?

413
00:20:21,630 --> 00:20:29,950
Everyone please be understanding, I thought out of everyone I would be best to mimic the song.

414
00:20:29,960 --> 00:20:32,050
Really, you guys can't do it?

415
00:20:32,060 --> 00:20:36,100
No. I can't do it. Of course Endo's the best.

416
00:20:35,260 --> 00:20:36,100
Really?

417
00:20:36,100 --> 00:20:41,450
That's right, I can't ask "What time is it?" in such a rude way like he does.

418
00:20:41,450 --> 00:20:45,550
I could only ask if it's "If you don't mind, could you tell me what time it is now, sir?"

419
00:20:45,190 --> 00:20:47,560
Daikichi, Very Good Boy!!

420
00:20:47,600 --> 00:20:49,480
Hosshan, you can't do the imitation?

421
00:20:49,490 --> 00:20:56,550
No. I can't. I was the one who told Endo to try mimicking in the first place.

422
00:20:56,100 --> 00:20:57,700
Oh no you don't have to say that.

423
00:20:58,200 --> 00:20:59,840
Hosshan, Quite A Good Boy!!

424
00:21:00,000 --> 00:21:01,040
Endo, Very Good Boy!!

425
00:21:01,210 --> 00:21:02,840
Hosshan, Incredibly Good Boy!!

426
00:21:03,010 --> 00:21:05,380
Endo, Incredibly Good Boy!!

427
00:21:04,000 --> 00:21:05,450
Yamazaki, what's wrong?

428
00:21:05,460 --> 00:21:08,050
Their friendship makes me cry.

429
00:21:07,410 --> 00:21:10,880
Yamasaki, Incredibly Good Boy!!

430
00:21:10,580 --> 00:21:12,830
What is wrong with him?

431
00:21:11,890 --> 00:21:16,180
Wow, what a nice shoot we're having today.

432
00:21:17,470 --> 00:21:21,060
The quiz battle to become a regular member is in confusion.

433
00:21:22,420 --> 00:21:24,000
And in this moment...

434
00:21:27,170 --> 00:21:28,920
What's happening?

435
00:21:29,350 --> 00:21:32,980
Macchan's Direct Negotiation!

436
00:21:33,490 --> 00:21:36,500
Great. Thank you. Cool.

437
00:21:36,710 --> 00:21:39,630
* She had trouble with her manager

438
00:21:36,710 --> 00:21:39,630
What can you say to Kobayashi Sachiko-san?

439
00:21:41,050 --> 00:21:41,880
Yes, Tanaka.

440
00:21:41,880 --> 00:21:43,510
I'm always with you.

441
00:21:44,210 --> 00:21:46,250
Tanaka, Very Good Boy!!

442
00:21:45,000 --> 00:21:46,100
That was good.

443
00:21:45,700 --> 00:21:46,950
It was good.

444
00:21:46,370 --> 00:21:46,950
Yep.

445
00:21:47,540 --> 00:21:48,400
Yes, go ahead.

446
00:21:48,550 --> 00:21:50,080
Some of your troubles was caused by me.

447
00:21:50,790 --> 00:21:54,590
Hosshan, Incredibly Good Boy!!

448
00:21:54,820 --> 00:21:56,120
Of course!

449
00:21:56,220 --> 00:22:02,400
You've got a really great sense of responsibility! Such a huge defense zone!

450
00:21:58,200 --> 00:22:00,150
It's really great!

451
00:22:03,750 --> 00:22:06,250
Eh? Something happened to you?

452
00:22:05,670 --> 00:22:06,640
Daikichi, Good Boy!!

453
00:22:06,800 --> 00:22:07,400
Daikichi, Good Boy!!

454
00:22:07,570 --> 00:22:11,040
Daikichi, Good Boy!!

455
00:22:08,650 --> 00:22:12,150
This kind of sympathy really helps.

456
00:22:10,450 --> 00:22:12,140
Is this ok? No more answers.

457
00:22:12,140 --> 00:22:17,250
People who've had a long career, like Yamazaki, should come up with something.

458
00:22:19,400 --> 00:22:22,500
Kobayashi Sachiko-san, I'm watching you.

459
00:22:22,510 --> 00:22:26,700
What you've done, is incredible.

460
00:22:27,250 --> 00:22:28,450
I'm supporting you..

461
00:22:29,200 --> 00:22:30,360
Sachiko-san...

462
00:22:31,100 --> 00:22:33,160
I love your outfits.

463
00:22:36,250 --> 00:22:37,000
Understand?

464
00:22:39,570 --> 00:22:41,200
Oka~y.

465
00:22:41,460 --> 00:22:44,070
Thank you very much.

466
00:23:00,450 --> 00:23:04,070
So, Matsumoto-san, who are the good boys who will become the regular members?

467
00:23:04,080 --> 00:23:05,170
Is it ok to wait a bit?

468
00:23:05,180 --> 00:23:06,520
What's wrong, Yamazaki-san?

469
00:23:06,520 --> 00:23:12,000
For doing such a great audition like this one, for us all, I thank you very much.

470
00:23:12,010 --> 00:23:14,400
Thank you very much.

471
00:23:13,400 --> 00:23:15,490
I should be thanking you.

472
00:23:17,260 --> 00:23:20,230
Oka~y.

473
00:23:20,230 --> 00:23:21,930
The winner please.

474
00:23:23,400 --> 00:23:28,970
The top 5 who were the best at being good boys, is...

475
00:23:29,700 --> 00:23:33,050
Everyone is a good boy!

476
00:23:33,600 --> 00:23:35,210
You all did it!

477
00:23:35,750 --> 00:23:37,340
Thank you very much.

478
00:23:37,350 --> 00:23:39,050
All of you were good boys!

479
00:23:39,050 --> 00:23:41,400
Thank you very much.

480
00:23:41,410 --> 00:23:42,020
Amazing.

481
00:23:42,020 --> 00:23:46,220
Foe ebrii sekom (for every second), you were all good boys!

482
00:23:46,950 --> 00:23:49,150
No worries.

483
00:23:47,850 --> 00:23:49,160
It's fine.

484
00:23:49,500 --> 00:23:52,600
Didn't he say "foe ebrii sekom"?

485
00:23:52,600 --> 00:23:55,700
I'm just overwhelmingly impressed!

486
00:23:59,800 --> 00:24:02,070
Oka~y
