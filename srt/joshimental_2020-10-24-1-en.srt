1
00:00:00,520 --> 00:00:03,870
So finally getting started   -Yes

2
00:00:03,870 --> 00:00:07,070
I may overlook some scenes on my own

3
00:00:07,070 --> 00:00:13,330
So I've invited these three members from Documental as witnesses

4
00:00:13,330 --> 00:00:14,570
Thank you for having us

5
00:00:14,570 --> 00:00:18,160
That's the same stage set in Documental right?   -Yes, it is

6
00:00:18,160 --> 00:00:20,410
They must feel nervous for that

7
00:00:20,410 --> 00:00:24,200
I wonder what's their motivation to join   -I hope they'll be fine

8
00:00:24,650 --> 00:00:27,010
There will be 7 contestants this time

9
00:00:27,010 --> 00:00:30,480
-Maybe nothing funny will happen at all right?
-Yeah, that's possible

10
00:00:31,010 --> 00:00:33,530
Well, it's about time to start

11
00:00:34,630 --> 00:00:35,950
Here they come

12
00:00:38,720 --> 00:00:41,190
She must be nervous for being the first one

13
00:00:43,330 --> 00:00:45,960
It's First Summer Uika   -I'm the first one...

14
00:00:46,550 --> 00:00:47,900
Excuse me

15
00:00:48,340 --> 00:00:49,900
Excuse me

16
00:00:57,870 --> 00:00:59,040
(Documental) I watched all of them

17
00:00:59,510 --> 00:01:02,710
Talking about confidence, well, I feel like half-and-half

18
00:01:02,710 --> 00:01:06,920
I'm going to knock down everyone in the room

19
00:01:06,920 --> 00:01:10,020
Wow, this is amazing

20
00:01:10,020 --> 00:01:11,820
It's the real one

21
00:01:11,820 --> 00:01:13,950
It doesn't feel good to be the first one right?

22
00:01:13,950 --> 00:01:15,840
Please, someone come quickly

23
00:01:18,440 --> 00:01:20,570
She brought something so big

24
00:01:20,570 --> 00:01:22,570
She's fully prepared   -Who is she?

25
00:01:23,320 --> 00:01:24,200
Who is she?

26
00:01:26,580 --> 00:01:29,190
Ah, it's Minegishi   -Nice to meet you

27
00:01:29,190 --> 00:01:32,400
Nice to meet you, I'm Minegishi Minami

28
00:01:32,870 --> 00:01:35,530
It gives me a chill

29
00:01:35,530 --> 00:01:37,720
Female Documental?   -Yes

30
00:01:37,810 --> 00:01:40,960
This is the most nervous moment of this year

31
00:01:40,960 --> 00:01:45,880
In a simple yet aggressive manner

32
00:01:45,880 --> 00:01:52,600
Well, these two people are used to variety shows anyway

33
00:01:54,940 --> 00:01:57,380
That's a big bag again, it's fully stuffed

34
00:02:00,480 --> 00:02:01,420
Nice to meet you

35
00:02:01,420 --> 00:02:04,470
It's Asahi Nao

36
00:02:04,940 --> 00:02:10,430
Eh, I have no confidence, to be honest

37
00:02:11,430 --> 00:02:13,850
By the way, they are all idols

38
00:02:14,580 --> 00:02:17,160
Someone's here   -She looks noble

39
00:02:17,450 --> 00:02:20,910
Does she look noble?   -Doesn't look like a comedian

40
00:02:25,270 --> 00:02:27,280
Yahoo   -Nice to meet you

41
00:02:27,280 --> 00:02:28,420
Nice to meet you

42
00:02:29,150 --> 00:02:30,690
Ah, that show right?

43
00:02:30,690 --> 00:02:32,690
I know about it

44
00:02:32,690 --> 00:02:33,850
Seriously?

45
00:02:33,850 --> 00:02:35,520
I'm invited by that show?

46
00:02:37,530 --> 00:02:39,170
I have to join!

47
00:02:39,170 --> 00:02:43,110
Female can win male comedian's Owarai

48
00:02:43,110 --> 00:02:46,360
I want to prove it to those male comedians

49
00:02:46,960 --> 00:02:50,280
Maybe all contestants will be from the same generation

50
00:02:50,280 --> 00:02:53,260
You're right   -This could be a battle with no scruples

51
00:02:53,620 --> 00:02:56,830
She looks like she's going to have a fight too

52
00:02:57,760 --> 00:02:59,090
Who is she?

53
00:03:03,270 --> 00:03:04,680
She must be strong

54
00:03:04,680 --> 00:03:07,840
Too strong   -She must be strong

55
00:03:08,330 --> 00:03:10,000
Is it fine to let me join?

56
00:03:10,000 --> 00:03:12,280
Matsumoto-san nominated you

57
00:03:12,280 --> 00:03:14,750
I'm so happy

58
00:03:14,750 --> 00:03:20,400
I want to let myself go and do want I what to do

59
00:03:20,400 --> 00:03:25,430
I will not laugh today!

60
00:03:26,040 --> 00:03:29,400
Looking at Kyouko-san always reminds me of your father

61
00:03:29,400 --> 00:03:31,700
Yeah, you're right

62
00:03:31,700 --> 00:03:33,450
They look alike

63
00:03:33,450 --> 00:03:34,530
Really?

64
00:03:36,270 --> 00:03:38,610
That's huge!

65
00:03:39,780 --> 00:03:41,740
Hello everybody!

66
00:03:46,300 --> 00:03:48,420
I'm joining! I'm joining! I'm so happy!

67
00:03:48,420 --> 00:03:53,560
Eh? Mental? Joshi...mental?

68
00:03:53,560 --> 00:03:57,220
I have no idea, but I'm going!

69
00:03:57,220 --> 00:04:01,360
I'm a voice actor, so I'm capable of making various sounds

70
00:04:01,360 --> 00:04:05,690
-So I'll try to work on this aspect today
-That sounds so scary

71
00:04:05,690 --> 00:04:10,140
-They're having such a great time
-Yeah, it's like a kitty party

72
00:04:10,140 --> 00:04:12,590
The atmosphere is different from Documental

73
00:04:12,980 --> 00:04:13,680
Hey!

74
00:04:16,370 --> 00:04:17,700
No way! No way!

75
00:04:17,700 --> 00:04:23,310
Someone awful is invited!

76
00:04:24,130 --> 00:04:26,460
Of course I'm going! I'm definitely going!

77
00:04:26,460 --> 00:04:28,730
Matsumoto Hitoshi-san?

78
00:04:30,000 --> 00:04:31,070
I'll work hard

79
00:04:31,320 --> 00:04:33,740
I've always wanted to meet you Matsuno Akemi-san!

80
00:04:33,740 --> 00:04:35,430
I've always wanted to meet you too!

81
00:04:35,430 --> 00:04:39,300
-The combination of contestants is amazing
-Yeah, it's incredible

82
00:04:39,300 --> 00:04:42,340
So it's about time to start, I'll go and meet them now

83
00:04:42,340 --> 00:04:43,950
Okay, got it

84
00:04:52,840 --> 00:04:54,950
You people are really having a good time huh?

85
00:04:54,950 --> 00:04:57,350
No, it's just these two

86
00:04:57,350 --> 00:04:59,700
Please take a seat

87
00:04:59,700 --> 00:05:03,830
We all have some understandings about the rules right?

88
00:05:03,830 --> 00:05:05,140
Yes, we know

89
00:05:05,140 --> 00:05:08,720
If you laugh for the first time, you'll get a yellow card

90
00:05:08,720 --> 00:05:12,090
For the second time, you'll get a red card and you're out

91
00:05:12,090 --> 00:05:13,350
No orange card this time

92
00:05:13,350 --> 00:05:15,490
If you're out, you will be banned from Fuji TV

93
00:05:15,490 --> 00:05:17,640
Eh, really?   -That's too much

94
00:05:17,640 --> 00:05:21,210
But if you win the contest, while there won't be any cash prizes

95
00:05:21,210 --> 00:05:27,380
You win the honorary title of Variety Queen   -I want it so badly

96
00:05:29,570 --> 00:05:32,000
It's not enough to just not laugh

97
00:05:32,000 --> 00:05:34,140
You have to be making others laugh

98
00:05:34,140 --> 00:05:39,800
Winning by simply ignoring other's performance is unworthy of the honor

99
00:05:39,800 --> 00:05:41,730
While it usually lasts for 6 hours

100
00:05:41,730 --> 00:05:45,600
For this time, it will last for 2 and a half hours

101
00:05:47,650 --> 00:05:52,140
The contest will start soon after I left the room

102
00:05:52,140 --> 00:05:55,600
Give me one second...HAHAHA

103
00:05:56,060 --> 00:05:59,950
This looks really scary   -This is terrifying

104
00:06:04,670 --> 00:06:08,970
Matsumoto-san is not impressed at all

105
00:06:08,970 --> 00:06:10,880
When does it start?

106
00:06:10,880 --> 00:06:12,850
Probably after a beep sound

107
00:06:12,850 --> 00:06:14,330
This is really going to start

108
00:06:14,330 --> 00:06:15,730
Oh my god, what should I do

109
00:06:15,730 --> 00:06:19,200
Well, they'll probably quiet down after it starts

110
00:06:19,200 --> 00:06:21,200
I bet they will   -Yeah, you're right

111
00:06:21,560 --> 00:06:25,120
Okay, let's get started

112
00:06:27,080 --> 00:06:31,620
I'm really looking forward to this   -Let's start

113
00:06:34,070 --> 00:06:35,620
This scared me

114
00:06:35,620 --> 00:06:38,940
It started   -Yeah, it started

115
00:06:54,520 --> 00:06:57,240
Let's get started

116
00:06:58,420 --> 00:07:01,240
This scared me

117
00:07:01,240 --> 00:07:04,520
It started   -Yeah, it started

118
00:07:04,880 --> 00:07:06,860
We can't laugh from now on right?   -Yes

119
00:07:06,860 --> 00:07:12,240
I'm really thirsty, may I get a drink first?   -Me too

120
00:07:13,280 --> 00:07:17,960
Ah, there's some fruits in here   -Yeah, that's amazing

121
00:07:17,960 --> 00:07:20,260
Like bananas   -Some snacks too

122
00:07:20,260 --> 00:07:23,190
She's laughing already right?

123
00:07:23,190 --> 00:07:25,510
Hamaguchi-san is laughing already right?

124
00:07:25,510 --> 00:07:26,450
Well, well, well

125
00:07:26,450 --> 00:07:29,100
She noticed it herself and quickly stopped laughing

126
00:07:29,520 --> 00:07:31,100
Don't drink too much

127
00:07:31,100 --> 00:07:32,000
Yes, I know

128
00:07:32,000 --> 00:07:34,190
Eh, did you laughed just now?

129
00:07:34,190 --> 00:07:35,240
No I didn't?

130
00:07:35,550 --> 00:07:37,940
Really?   -Yes, I didn't

131
00:07:37,940 --> 00:07:39,820
Matsuno-san is laughing all the time too

132
00:07:39,820 --> 00:07:43,670
I'll go and warn them about this, if they went too far

133
00:07:43,880 --> 00:07:47,650
I wonder who will be attacking first though

134
00:07:50,340 --> 00:07:52,120
I love those laughing bags

135
00:07:53,120 --> 00:07:56,020
-I have tons of laughing bags at home   -Oh, you like it?

136
00:07:56,020 --> 00:07:57,170
I love laughing bags

137
00:07:57,700 --> 00:07:58,700
Why do you like it?

138
00:07:58,700 --> 00:08:04,020
I use to let those bags laugh one after another, and I'll laugh at last, but I can't show it today though

139
00:08:04,020 --> 00:08:08,250
Can you show it to us, without laughing at the end then?

140
00:08:08,250 --> 00:08:12,780
-Got it, so I won't laugh at the end this time
-Yes, the no laughing version

141
00:08:12,780 --> 00:08:14,780
I won't laugh, but I usually do it like this

142
00:08:23,450 --> 00:08:24,550
And then?

143
00:08:27,410 --> 00:08:30,810
What the heck is this?

144
00:08:30,810 --> 00:08:32,580
This is amazing

145
00:08:33,570 --> 00:08:34,860
What the heck is this, seriously?

146
00:08:35,260 --> 00:08:37,730
I can't hold back on this one, I'm laughing already

147
00:08:37,730 --> 00:08:38,730
Yeah, I'll laugh at this one

148
00:08:38,730 --> 00:08:41,580
-Yeah, if we were there
-I'll definitely laugh if I'm there

149
00:08:41,580 --> 00:08:43,760
I actually had hearing loss because of my own voice

150
00:08:44,600 --> 00:08:47,740
How come?   -Because my voice is too loud

151
00:08:47,740 --> 00:08:50,600
Therefore my ears always hurt because of my own voice

152
00:08:50,600 --> 00:08:52,540
Eh?   -My ears always hurt and...

153
00:08:52,540 --> 00:08:56,660
And when gibbons are in danger, and ask other mem...members...

154
00:08:56,660 --> 00:08:59,680
-Sorry but you're not speaking smoothly despite being a voice actor
-Yes, I'm bad at speaking smoothly

155
00:08:59,680 --> 00:09:05,510
My voice has the same sound wave as gibbons,
when they are in danger and ask other members for help

156
00:09:08,740 --> 00:09:11,150
That's incredible!

157
00:09:14,390 --> 00:09:17,000
Uika tried hard to hold back on this one

158
00:09:17,000 --> 00:09:20,510
Uika was close right? She tried hard to hold back

159
00:09:20,510 --> 00:09:23,620
And whenever I visit the zoo, all of the animals will poo

160
00:09:23,620 --> 00:09:27,180
They all poo because of my voice   -Poo?

161
00:09:27,950 --> 00:09:29,180
They all poo, poop

162
00:09:29,940 --> 00:09:33,880
And since it cures their constipation,
they always invite me to come

163
00:09:34,560 --> 00:09:36,380
What kind of voice is that?

164
00:09:42,810 --> 00:09:47,560
Asahi was very close   -She tried hard to hold back

165
00:09:48,640 --> 00:09:49,990
She should had push it further

166
00:09:49,990 --> 00:09:53,760
-Can I perform a stunt in place of my self introduction?
-Yes, of course

167
00:09:54,370 --> 00:09:55,650
May I?

168
00:09:55,650 --> 00:10:01,800
So I'll perform my stunt of putting a 10 dollars coin to my nose and eyes

169
00:10:03,880 --> 00:10:05,650
That's amazing

170
00:10:08,330 --> 00:10:09,860
Why did you thought about doing this?

171
00:10:10,620 --> 00:10:13,660
I'll continue   -Kyoko-san is staring at it

172
00:10:16,000 --> 00:10:18,320
-Don't push yourself too hard
-Has it been a while since you last did it?

173
00:10:18,320 --> 00:10:21,480
Wow, that's amazing!

174
00:10:22,650 --> 00:10:25,320
It's quite boring to do it myself today, so...

175
00:10:25,760 --> 00:10:27,890
Let's do this together, if you don't mind

176
00:10:27,890 --> 00:10:31,150
All together?   -I never did it before though

177
00:10:32,250 --> 00:10:34,920
These coins are sterilized   -Thank you

178
00:10:35,600 --> 00:10:37,950
Thank you for doing this   -This is amazing

179
00:10:38,390 --> 00:10:40,940
Should I just pass this around?   -I always wanted to try this

180
00:10:40,940 --> 00:10:42,720
You wanted to try it?   -Yes

181
00:10:42,720 --> 00:10:44,740
Start from putting it to the nose right?   -Yes

182
00:10:45,100 --> 00:10:46,580
It's fine if you can't put it in

183
00:10:48,650 --> 00:10:50,600
It's not going in at all   -I don't think it's gonna fit

184
00:10:50,600 --> 00:10:53,230
It's normally impossible to put it in

185
00:10:54,220 --> 00:10:55,490
It's not going in

186
00:10:57,170 --> 00:10:58,650
My nostril is not widening

187
00:10:58,650 --> 00:10:59,740
Your nostril is too small

188
00:11:00,200 --> 00:11:01,700
Wow, that looks painful!

189
00:11:01,700 --> 00:11:02,890
You don't need to force yourself

190
00:11:05,420 --> 00:11:07,830
It went it!   -Ah, it fell out

191
00:11:08,250 --> 00:11:10,860
It almost went it, I almost did it

192
00:11:12,400 --> 00:11:13,740
Not as difficult as it looks

193
00:11:13,740 --> 00:11:15,370
You shouldn't be fainting in order to do this

194
00:11:16,030 --> 00:11:17,510
Ah, is it in?

195
00:11:18,480 --> 00:11:19,530
It's easier to put it in the nose?

196
00:11:20,710 --> 00:11:22,850
Yes, just like that   -Like this?

197
00:11:22,850 --> 00:11:25,610
Ouch, ouch, ouch, this hurts

198
00:11:25,610 --> 00:11:28,500
I really want to put it in even if my nose splits

199
00:11:28,970 --> 00:11:30,200
Ah, Uika is in danger

200
00:11:31,070 --> 00:11:35,210
For your eyes, instead of putting it in, you should just clamp it with your eyelids

201
00:11:35,210 --> 00:11:37,590
Eww, I don't want to do that

202
00:11:37,940 --> 00:11:40,180
Give it a try, these coins are properly sterilized

203
00:11:40,650 --> 00:11:42,290
Hamaguchi were you able to put it in your nose?

204
00:11:42,420 --> 00:11:44,020
I want to try it with my eyes

205
00:11:45,170 --> 00:11:46,480
Both eyes at the same time?

206
00:11:46,990 --> 00:11:48,890
Kyoko-chan isn't even trying to get it done

207
00:11:50,020 --> 00:11:52,810
Well, it's kind of clamped by the eyelids

208
00:12:01,200 --> 00:12:03,900
She laughed   -She definitely laughed

209
00:12:05,480 --> 00:12:08,370
That counts as well? Did someone even laughed?

210
00:12:12,730 --> 00:12:16,160
Kyoko-san, I'll give you a yellow card

211
00:12:16,160 --> 00:12:17,200
You laughed right?

212
00:12:17,840 --> 00:12:21,320
I, Kyoko, is trying to put this 10 dollars coin...

213
00:12:21,320 --> 00:12:26,390
I have to clamp it with the muscles here, therefore...

214
00:12:27,620 --> 00:12:29,870
I have to move my face like this

215
00:12:29,870 --> 00:12:33,230
Or else, it's impossible to clamp it with those muscles

216
00:12:33,230 --> 00:12:35,220
Therefore, I, Kyoko, did not laugh

217
00:12:37,020 --> 00:12:38,160
She laughed right?

218
00:12:38,740 --> 00:12:40,930
Come on, you're not being arrested

219
00:12:44,740 --> 00:12:46,130
I want to try it with my eyes

220
00:12:46,130 --> 00:12:47,240
(I know you're trying hard here)

221
00:12:47,240 --> 00:12:48,650
Both eyes at the same time?

222
00:12:48,650 --> 00:12:51,090
(We all laughed while watching this scene)

223
00:12:52,890 --> 00:12:54,390
Right after here   -I'm not laughing here

224
00:12:54,390 --> 00:12:56,430
But right after here, look, you're clearly laughing

225
00:12:58,060 --> 00:13:00,000
You definitely laughed

226
00:13:00,660 --> 00:13:02,830
You completely laughed here

227
00:13:04,410 --> 00:13:06,050
And your face says "I screwed up" right after

228
00:13:07,770 --> 00:13:10,240
Yes, I agree   -You're honest

229
00:13:10,740 --> 00:13:12,360
Have to be careful at those times

230
00:13:12,360 --> 00:13:15,160
Those are the crucial moments to be aware of   -You're right

231
00:13:17,190 --> 00:13:18,980
Her face was astonishing

232
00:13:20,190 --> 00:13:23,840
Kyoko-san understands how it works now,
she's like "so this is how it will be judged"

233
00:13:24,780 --> 00:13:26,750
Kyoko-san is getting into the swing of it

234
00:13:26,750 --> 00:13:28,070
Let's start

235
00:13:32,940 --> 00:13:34,660
You couldn't put it in right?   -Yeah

236
00:13:34,660 --> 00:13:38,300
But actually, I can do a stunt too

237
00:13:38,860 --> 00:13:41,040
They are all making a move

238
00:13:41,240 --> 00:13:42,070
Can I perform it?

239
00:13:43,530 --> 00:13:46,980
My hand...my fist can fit my mouth

240
00:13:47,600 --> 00:13:49,360
Oh my god, please don't force yourself

241
00:13:49,770 --> 00:13:51,430
No way, your mouth is small

242
00:13:51,430 --> 00:13:53,740
My jaw was dislocated because of doing this

243
00:13:54,370 --> 00:13:55,740
Please be careful

244
00:14:04,870 --> 00:14:05,960
No way, that's just impossible

245
00:14:05,960 --> 00:14:07,370
I'm almost there

246
00:14:09,310 --> 00:14:11,550
Did you try this before? Is this your first time?

247
00:14:11,550 --> 00:14:12,320
Not the first time

248
00:14:13,290 --> 00:14:15,800
There's still plenty of time left, don't force yourself

249
00:14:16,030 --> 00:14:17,480
Don't hurt yourself now

250
00:14:20,780 --> 00:14:24,500
Yukipoyo, hold her elbow, hold her elbow!

251
00:14:26,190 --> 00:14:28,800
That's amazing

252
00:14:28,800 --> 00:14:31,380
Anything else? Only this?

253
00:14:31,380 --> 00:14:33,080
Huh?   -Is this the only stunt that you can do?

254
00:14:33,080 --> 00:14:36,090
What is the timing for us to clap our hands and praise?

255
00:14:36,400 --> 00:14:39,680
I can put it in further   -No please, that's enough

256
00:14:39,680 --> 00:14:42,650
When is the moment that your performance ends and be like "Hooray!"

257
00:14:42,650 --> 00:14:45,100
The moment of "Hooray" right? Got it, I'll tell you

258
00:14:45,100 --> 00:14:47,410
You'll tell us with your fist in your mouth?   -Can you do it?

259
00:14:50,110 --> 00:14:51,020
That looks painful

260
00:14:53,680 --> 00:14:54,720
That looks painful

261
00:14:56,670 --> 00:14:59,060
Matsuno-san was completely laughing

262
00:15:00,510 --> 00:15:02,020
And she didn't even notice it

263
00:15:02,020 --> 00:15:06,120
Why are people not aware of themselves laughing

264
00:15:09,240 --> 00:15:10,290
Eh, who is it?

265
00:15:12,210 --> 00:15:13,720
Matsuno-san, you were completely laughing

266
00:15:13,720 --> 00:15:15,900
Eh? No, I didn't laugh!

267
00:15:17,590 --> 00:15:19,180
That already made you laugh?

268
00:15:19,180 --> 00:15:20,920
You're laughing just because of that?

269
00:15:20,920 --> 00:15:23,320
Matsuno-san was completely laughing   -Sure she did

270
00:15:24,770 --> 00:15:27,070
You'll tell us with your fist in your mouth?   -Can you do it?

271
00:15:27,350 --> 00:15:28,970
Ouch, that looks painful

272
00:15:33,640 --> 00:15:36,430
You clearly laughed   -We can even see your teeth

273
00:15:42,640 --> 00:15:44,170
Let's start

274
00:15:46,260 --> 00:15:47,550
Ah, that's strict

275
00:15:48,340 --> 00:15:50,140
Maybe it's time for me to perform now

276
00:15:51,380 --> 00:15:54,370
Really?   -I want to perform my gags first before I'm out

277
00:15:54,680 --> 00:15:57,440
You prepared some gags?   -Not really gags though

278
00:15:57,700 --> 00:16:00,180
Matsuno Akemi's...where should I face?

279
00:16:01,450 --> 00:16:04,220
The running lesson! Let's start running

280
00:16:04,220 --> 00:16:05,510
Start running?

281
00:16:05,680 --> 00:16:08,060
You shouldn't be just running in a marathon

282
00:16:08,060 --> 00:16:09,290
You should run with your arms

283
00:16:09,290 --> 00:16:11,180
You have to swing your arms while running

284
00:16:12,260 --> 00:16:13,700
Please follow me

285
00:16:13,700 --> 00:16:17,330
Okay, now imagine you're slowly holding up an egg

286
00:16:17,330 --> 00:16:22,400
Hold it up carefully, and your thumbs should...!@#$%...

287
00:16:22,400 --> 00:16:25,610
Excuse me, what did you say just now?   -One, two, one, two

288
00:16:25,610 --> 00:16:29,520
Hold your stomach, stretch your back...!@#$%...

289
00:16:29,520 --> 00:16:31,810
Whaaat?   -Let's start, one, two, one, two

290
00:16:31,810 --> 00:16:36,900
One, two, one, two

291
00:16:36,900 --> 00:16:39,280
Swing your arms

292
00:16:39,280 --> 00:16:41,800
How should this end?

293
00:16:41,800 --> 00:16:43,630
What should they do after this?

294
00:16:43,630 --> 00:16:46,570
I think she don't know either   -I bet so

295
00:16:46,570 --> 00:16:47,300
What the heck is this?

296
00:16:48,920 --> 00:16:53,650
This is hell   -This is awful

297
00:16:53,650 --> 00:16:58,600
Instead of laughing, I feel like "what are they even doing?"

298
00:16:59,590 --> 00:17:00,970
You feel relax now right?

299
00:17:00,970 --> 00:17:03,910
Yeah, my body feel relaxed now

300
00:17:05,300 --> 00:17:07,630
Hamaguchi-san's face looks so relaxed now

301
00:17:07,630 --> 00:17:09,400
My face is softened

302
00:17:09,400 --> 00:17:11,830
No way, your face went numb

303
00:17:17,970 --> 00:17:19,540
Let's soften our faces then

304
00:17:20,240 --> 00:17:23,680
I've brought something that can soften everyone's face in that bag

305
00:17:27,030 --> 00:17:30,370
I've brought something that follows up the scene too

306
00:17:30,370 --> 00:17:31,620
Follow-up?

307
00:17:31,620 --> 00:17:36,390
Let's move together then, one, two, one, two

308
00:17:36,390 --> 00:17:38,810
What the heck were they asked to do just now?

309
00:17:38,810 --> 00:17:41,810
Matsuno-san is amazing   -Yeah, she's incredible

310
00:17:42,180 --> 00:17:45,350
People always say that I'm like Matsuno-san

311
00:17:45,350 --> 00:17:46,380
You mean your character?

312
00:17:46,380 --> 00:17:47,570
Yeah, and like how we speak

313
00:17:50,910 --> 00:17:52,280
Our voice sound similar

314
00:17:52,280 --> 00:17:54,080
When did you start talking in this tone though?

315
00:17:54,080 --> 00:17:56,530
Eh? I wonder when...

316
00:18:02,360 --> 00:18:03,810
That's the monkey scene before

317
00:18:03,810 --> 00:18:05,960
No way, I definitely can't hold on this one

318
00:18:06,400 --> 00:18:07,880
Is it fine to go at this pace though?

319
00:18:07,880 --> 00:18:10,270
Well, she's always like this anyway

320
00:18:11,450 --> 00:18:13,550
Did she drink all of the cold medicine?

321
00:18:16,010 --> 00:18:19,130
Can you speak in a deeper voice, or like in a normal voice?

322
00:18:19,130 --> 00:18:21,900
Yes, I can   -Can you show us, please?

323
00:18:21,900 --> 00:18:23,930
What phrase do you want me to say?

324
00:18:23,930 --> 00:18:26,300
What about some sexy phrases?   -No problem

325
00:18:26,300 --> 00:18:29,190
Let me know what you want me to say, and I'll say it in a sexy way

326
00:18:29,190 --> 00:18:31,610
Then what about "I don't want to leave yet"

327
00:18:33,950 --> 00:18:39,210
I don't want to leave yet...umm...ahh...

328
00:18:39,620 --> 00:18:41,280
How did Minekishi not laugh at that

329
00:18:41,590 --> 00:18:43,370
Minekishi is in danger

330
00:18:45,280 --> 00:18:47,960
Umm~~~

331
00:18:48,750 --> 00:18:51,610
Minekishi is very close, Minekishi is in danger

332
00:18:51,610 --> 00:18:53,030
Well done for holding on that one

333
00:18:53,280 --> 00:18:55,890
Are you able to speak in a deep male voice then?

334
00:18:55,890 --> 00:18:59,850
I've actually spoke in a deep voice, when I'm imitating Oda Yuji-san

335
00:18:59,850 --> 00:19:01,230
Oda Yuji-san? I want to see it

336
00:19:01,230 --> 00:19:03,330
Which scene of Oda Yuji-san did you imitate?

337
00:19:03,330 --> 00:19:05,330
Odoru Daisōsasen   -Eh?

338
00:19:06,460 --> 00:19:10,140
Moroyi-san, why are there people injured here?

339
00:19:10,140 --> 00:19:12,330
We can't lockdown the rainbow bridge then

340
00:19:12,330 --> 00:19:14,240
How the heck is this Oda Yuji-san?

341
00:19:15,500 --> 00:19:18,010
It's interesting though

342
00:19:19,110 --> 00:19:20,900
Ah, something's happening over there

343
00:19:20,900 --> 00:19:21,970
I'm Matsuno Akemi

344
00:19:26,250 --> 00:19:28,280
Excuse me, please give me a hand

345
00:19:28,280 --> 00:19:30,010
Someone please hold the finish line

346
00:19:30,810 --> 00:19:33,860
This is just...   -This is awful

347
00:19:34,130 --> 00:19:36,200
Is something going to happen?

348
00:19:40,780 --> 00:19:43,580
Hey, this tripped me

349
00:19:44,020 --> 00:19:47,600
This tripped me, help me up

350
00:19:47,990 --> 00:19:51,520
Someone came out, something's happening

351
00:19:51,520 --> 00:19:54,290
Matsuken? Is she acting Matsuken Samba?

352
00:19:54,290 --> 00:19:55,630
Yeah, it's Matsuken Samba

353
00:19:56,150 --> 00:19:58,680
Which means? Is she going to...

354
00:20:00,960 --> 00:20:01,820
Really?

355
00:20:05,750 --> 00:20:08,230
-She went back   -She probably left something

356
00:20:09,320 --> 00:20:12,710
Eh? How can you forget something about that?

357
00:20:13,110 --> 00:20:15,960
And Matsuno-san is not yet finished too

358
00:20:17,930 --> 00:20:20,540
She's back   -Here she comes

359
00:20:20,540 --> 00:20:24,250
What's that costume?   -I think I saw it somewhere before

360
00:20:24,250 --> 00:20:26,760
I feel nostalgic   -What's that?

361
00:20:27,170 --> 00:20:28,260
What, what, what?

362
00:20:33,340 --> 00:20:35,970
She's really gonna dance, this is hilarious

363
00:20:36,540 --> 00:20:39,050
Why is she dancing this now though?

364
00:20:43,470 --> 00:20:44,990
With such a serious face

365
00:20:57,480 --> 00:20:59,630
She's facing the refrigerator

366
00:21:10,100 --> 00:21:11,540
The song ended

367
00:21:14,570 --> 00:21:16,110
Why did you face that way all the time?

368
00:21:17,550 --> 00:21:20,260
That's all?   -Seems like there's another song

369
00:21:21,140 --> 00:21:24,210
That's it for me, I'll go back over there first

370
00:21:34,290 --> 00:21:36,840
It took her so much time, but still...

371
00:21:38,530 --> 00:21:40,750
She turned her back on us for 90% of the time though

372
00:21:40,750 --> 00:21:42,700
I wonder why though

373
00:21:43,840 --> 00:21:46,900
Maybe she'll laugh if she's facing us?

374
00:21:49,080 --> 00:21:53,480
Can I ask something that can only be asked in this situation?

375
00:21:53,480 --> 00:21:55,650
With so many female talents here...

376
00:21:55,650 --> 00:21:58,130
This could be a lame question to ask, but...

377
00:21:58,520 --> 00:22:02,280
Let's have some girl's talk, like did anyone tries to flirt with you?

378
00:22:02,280 --> 00:22:03,580
Like these kinds of gossip

379
00:22:03,580 --> 00:22:06,230
So you mean within the entertainment circle?   -Yes

380
00:22:07,040 --> 00:22:08,970
No one tried to flirt with me yet

381
00:22:09,440 --> 00:22:13,950
I've just started to join TV shows recently, so not at all

382
00:22:13,950 --> 00:22:18,060
Well, I shouldn't be saying these kinds of things as an ex-idol

383
00:22:18,060 --> 00:22:21,060
But I hope you all can listen to me

384
00:22:21,060 --> 00:22:23,230
Eh? What, what, what?

385
00:22:23,230 --> 00:22:25,980
Well, many things happened, and I usually don't talk about this, but...

386
00:22:25,980 --> 00:22:29,420
I've been in AKB for 15 years

387
00:22:29,420 --> 00:22:35,350
Just for once, someone gave me his contact after a singing talent show

388
00:22:35,350 --> 00:22:38,190
That's so nice   -Yeah, that's worth yearning for

389
00:22:38,190 --> 00:22:40,310
So someone gave me his contact

390
00:22:40,310 --> 00:22:42,960
After the show ends, and we're already saying "goodbye"

391
00:22:42,960 --> 00:22:45,630
Just before I leave, he stealthily passed me his contact

392
00:22:45,630 --> 00:22:47,260
Eh?!   -Wow, that's like comics

393
00:22:47,260 --> 00:22:49,780
That's really worth yearning for   -That's so nice

394
00:22:49,780 --> 00:22:51,780
My heart skipped a beat

395
00:22:51,780 --> 00:22:52,930
What was written on it?

396
00:22:52,930 --> 00:22:54,090
His phone number

397
00:22:54,090 --> 00:22:57,390
And his name is Y****

398
00:22:59,680 --> 00:23:02,720
Holy moly, this gal is mad!

399
00:23:02,720 --> 00:23:04,660
She's the worst

400
00:23:06,010 --> 00:23:08,840
She dropped a massive bomb

401
00:23:08,840 --> 00:23:11,230
This gal is unbelievable

402
00:23:11,230 --> 00:23:13,490
That attack was aggressive

403
00:23:13,490 --> 00:23:16,240
I was wondering why is she so quiet all this time

404
00:23:16,240 --> 00:23:18,070
So she was waiting for this

405
00:23:19,810 --> 00:23:21,300
Did you phone him then?

406
00:23:21,300 --> 00:23:23,440
Yes, I phoned him   -Eh? You phoned him?

407
00:23:24,970 --> 00:23:27,970
Well, he is her senior, so I think she just had to phone him

408
00:23:27,970 --> 00:23:30,070
Did you two hangout for dinner then?

409
00:23:30,070 --> 00:23:32,140
We didn't hangout though

410
00:23:32,140 --> 00:23:34,400
So this is the atmosphere when there's only females

411
00:23:34,830 --> 00:23:36,400
I thought someone would have laughed

412
00:23:36,400 --> 00:23:38,900
This is the unique thing about this contest

413
00:23:39,060 --> 00:23:41,210
Are you gals hungry?

414
00:23:41,210 --> 00:23:44,860
I've prepared some snacks for you all   -That's awesome

415
00:23:45,100 --> 00:23:47,660
Let's have some snacks and chat

416
00:23:49,230 --> 00:23:50,600
Do you read books?

417
00:23:50,600 --> 00:23:52,660
Books? No, Yuki don't, I can't read vertically aligned texts

418
00:23:50,600 --> 00:23:55,570
*Japanese novels are written in vertical columns

419
00:23:52,660 --> 00:23:55,570
Vertical texts?   -Yes, vertically aligned texts

420
00:23:55,570 --> 00:23:57,100
You mean those vertical writings?   -Yes

421
00:23:57,100 --> 00:24:01,530
After entering this entertainment circle, I noticed that there's plenty of things to learn

422
00:24:01,530 --> 00:24:04,020
So I started reading some books

423
00:24:04,020 --> 00:24:06,670
To be able to give good comments on shows

424
00:24:06,840 --> 00:24:09,290
Can I recommend some books to you all?

425
00:24:10,330 --> 00:24:12,710
I hope you all will give it a shot

426
00:24:15,580 --> 00:24:18,310
Wow, that's amazing! You sure have been reading it in detail

427
00:24:18,310 --> 00:24:19,510
It's full of notes

428
00:24:22,550 --> 00:24:24,430
Wow, the second season, "Matsumoto"

429
00:24:26,040 --> 00:24:28,470
Are these two the same book?

430
00:24:28,470 --> 00:24:30,430
No, they're different

431
00:24:30,430 --> 00:24:31,740
Ah, it's "Yome!"

432
00:24:31,740 --> 00:24:33,740
Written by Hamada

433
00:24:33,740 --> 00:24:35,890
No notes at all

434
00:24:37,030 --> 00:24:38,340
Not even one

435
00:24:41,650 --> 00:24:43,650
Although it's interesting, but will they understand?

436
00:24:43,650 --> 00:24:46,190
The gag of only Hamada-san's book has no notes at all

437
00:24:46,190 --> 00:24:47,990
It's too high level

438
00:24:48,300 --> 00:24:51,070
This book "Matsumoto" by Matsumoto Hitoshi

439
00:24:51,470 --> 00:24:54,450
What a no-brain title

440
00:24:57,030 --> 00:24:58,610
You're being teased by Yukipoyo

441
00:24:59,120 --> 00:25:01,480
Up until now, you're being teased by a frivolous girl

442
00:25:02,280 --> 00:25:03,470
Let's play Jenga?

443
00:25:03,470 --> 00:25:05,210
Jenga?   -Sure, let's play

444
00:25:05,430 --> 00:25:09,220
"Hey, you're not my friend anymore"

445
00:25:09,220 --> 00:25:12,890
"You're someone more important than friends"

446
00:25:12,890 --> 00:25:17,220
"Keep those tears as a secret"   -She sings so well

447
00:25:17,220 --> 00:25:23,920
"Please stay beside me my friend"

448
00:25:24,570 --> 00:25:27,660
I thought it would be difficult to wear that wig

449
00:25:31,580 --> 00:25:34,770
"Look upon the sunny sky"

450
00:25:34,770 --> 00:25:36,440
*Lunch Pack (sandwich) was endorsed by Ayame Gouriki, the singer of this song, and her dance in the CM was so popular that it's even called the "Gouriki Dance"

451
00:25:34,770 --> 00:25:36,440
She's handing out those Lunch Packs

452
00:25:38,900 --> 00:25:42,160
"The sun~"   -Thank you very much

453
00:25:44,170 --> 00:25:46,290
It's really Lunch Pack

454
00:25:47,230 --> 00:25:50,010
And that propeller dance has been very popular

455
00:26:08,750 --> 00:26:11,020
Although you're dancing professionally...

456
00:26:14,240 --> 00:26:15,190
Asahi is...

457
00:26:17,390 --> 00:26:21,030
Asahi and Uika is in danger

458
00:26:21,030 --> 00:26:23,030
This is incredible

459
00:26:24,890 --> 00:26:26,940
Please enjoy your Lunch Pack

460
00:26:26,940 --> 00:26:30,650
That's amazing   -I really hope it made someone laugh

461
00:26:30,650 --> 00:26:32,640
That was really awesome   -Yeah

462
00:26:32,640 --> 00:26:36,040
If you think about it now, Hamaguchi's Samba dance sucks

463
00:26:37,600 --> 00:26:39,550
The quality is terrible

464
00:26:40,320 --> 00:26:41,760
When have you last wore a wig?

465
00:26:40,320 --> 00:26:47,000
*Minegishi shaved her head and offered a filmed apology after breaking her management firm's rules by spending a night with her boyfriend

466
00:26:43,710 --> 00:26:44,850
9 years ago

467
00:26:47,420 --> 00:26:49,760
You're much more mature now then

468
00:26:49,760 --> 00:26:53,190
I was 19 years old back then   -Eh, 19 years old?

469
00:26:53,190 --> 00:26:56,940
-I thought it happened recently though
-Yukipoyo is doing something

470
00:26:58,840 --> 00:27:01,860
Don't tell me she's finding for that photo   -That's terrible

471
00:27:01,860 --> 00:27:03,990
She's definitely googling for that photo

472
00:27:05,810 --> 00:27:08,190
The photo of her being bald?   -Is she going to show it?

473
00:27:10,400 --> 00:27:11,260
Seriously?

474
00:27:11,860 --> 00:27:13,610
If she really shows that photo here...

475
00:27:15,080 --> 00:27:16,870
But if you keep wearing a wig...

476
00:27:20,180 --> 00:27:22,960
But this hairstyle really suits Minekishi

477
00:27:23,440 --> 00:27:27,550
She's just so mean   -Twisting the knife in the wound

478
00:27:29,690 --> 00:27:32,700
How could these people hold back on that?

479
00:27:33,350 --> 00:27:35,210
Your skin texture looks the same

480
00:27:36,230 --> 00:27:38,600
You didn't change at all

481
00:27:40,890 --> 00:27:42,800
She's even standing beside it

482
00:27:42,800 --> 00:27:44,420
They all held on with that

483
00:27:44,420 --> 00:27:46,420
That's incredible

484
00:27:46,670 --> 00:27:49,480
Nothing changed at all, you look exactly the same

485
00:27:49,480 --> 00:27:51,480
She's really is cute right?

486
00:27:51,480 --> 00:27:53,170
Yeah, she's really cute

487
00:27:53,250 --> 00:27:56,980
This gal is really the worst, she's the meanest person

488
00:27:56,980 --> 00:28:00,510
Yukipoyo   -That's the level of a genius hacker

489
00:28:00,510 --> 00:28:03,060
She took out her phone immediately

490
00:28:03,590 --> 00:28:05,690
Who did this?

491
00:28:06,350 --> 00:28:07,500
Ah, it's me, I'm sorry

492
00:28:08,750 --> 00:28:11,180
You put back the ones that you used right?

493
00:28:11,180 --> 00:28:13,180
I'm so sorry  -Uh-oh

494
00:28:13,180 --> 00:28:14,380
Oh no, she's gonna be scolded

495
00:28:14,380 --> 00:28:16,140
This is no good right?   -Yes, I'm sorry

496
00:28:16,140 --> 00:28:18,350
These should be used to clean dirts

497
00:28:19,420 --> 00:28:21,180
I'm so sorry about this

498
00:28:27,060 --> 00:28:29,960
She's taking advantage of that bald impression

499
00:28:29,960 --> 00:28:31,790
She's being really aggressive

500
00:28:31,790 --> 00:28:33,370
I'll deeply reflect on myself

501
00:28:34,280 --> 00:28:35,020
She's close

502
00:28:36,250 --> 00:28:37,980
Did Yukipoyo laugh?

503
00:28:37,980 --> 00:28:39,840
I'll deeply reflect on myself

504
00:28:40,150 --> 00:28:42,640
But I feel like you're just fooling around

505
00:28:42,640 --> 00:28:45,850
Do it in front of Yukipoyo, come on!

506
00:28:45,850 --> 00:28:49,850
Just one final push   -That's such a waste of chance

507
00:28:49,850 --> 00:28:51,500
Notice it, notice it!

508
00:28:51,500 --> 00:28:52,850
They didn't notice it

509
00:28:52,850 --> 00:28:55,070
That was a good chance

510
00:28:55,070 --> 00:28:58,120
Yukipoyo was very close

511
00:28:58,120 --> 00:29:05,820
"Run forward, run forward, everyone run forward!"

512
00:29:05,820 --> 00:29:07,760
I see where this is going, this is awful

513
00:29:07,760 --> 00:29:09,330
This is just...

514
00:29:10,250 --> 00:29:13,140
The timing that she came out was superb

515
00:29:15,900 --> 00:29:17,570
Is this Sunplaza Nakano-kun?

516
00:29:17,570 --> 00:29:21,310
My husband posted a photo of me in this costume to Instagram

517
00:29:21,310 --> 00:29:23,710
And Sunplaza Nakano-san liked the post

518
00:29:25,020 --> 00:29:29,620
But it feels good to sing that song

519
00:29:29,620 --> 00:29:32,890
Is this skin-tight garment?   -Yes

520
00:29:32,890 --> 00:29:35,220
And it says Nakano   -Very cute

521
00:29:35,220 --> 00:29:36,170
Very cute?

522
00:29:37,990 --> 00:29:38,880
So hot

523
00:29:40,020 --> 00:29:41,300
Ah, she's bald

524
00:29:44,090 --> 00:29:45,700
Who said she's bald

525
00:29:46,820 --> 00:29:49,940
I can't believe there's still people trying to get a laugh with fleeing soldiers nowadays

526
00:29:49,940 --> 00:29:52,320
Fleeing soldier is not interesting at all

527
00:29:52,320 --> 00:29:54,140
Not interesting at all

528
00:29:54,500 --> 00:29:58,410
I'm friends with Zakoshisyoh

529
00:30:00,010 --> 00:30:03,670
And Zakoshisyoh-san said I can do his gag "exaggerated imitation"

530
00:30:04,450 --> 00:30:07,600
I want to watch you do "exaggerated imitation"   -Oh, do you?

531
00:30:07,600 --> 00:30:09,810
Let's say, Hanzawa Naoki-san

532
00:30:11,070 --> 00:30:12,330
Oh, he's popular right now

533
00:30:12,840 --> 00:30:15,060
But he's already quite exaggerated though

534
00:30:15,060 --> 00:30:18,920
No way, his exaggeration is not enough at all, we need more

535
00:30:18,920 --> 00:30:20,780
I'll do it now, are you ready?

536
00:30:34,110 --> 00:30:35,120
That's hilarious

537
00:30:36,920 --> 00:30:39,650
It's so long

538
00:30:42,180 --> 00:30:43,460
Eye for an eye!

539
00:30:48,080 --> 00:30:51,110
Minekishi is in danger

540
00:30:51,110 --> 00:30:54,940
I can do any character that you want me to do, just let me know

541
00:30:54,940 --> 00:30:56,200
Eh? Any character?

542
00:30:56,200 --> 00:30:56,760
Yes, any

543
00:30:56,760 --> 00:30:57,830
What about Hamada-san?

544
00:30:57,830 --> 00:30:59,830
Hamada-san, got it

545
00:31:03,120 --> 00:31:05,030
Why those eyes?   -Facial expression is important

546
00:31:05,030 --> 00:31:06,590
It all starts like this

547
00:31:06,590 --> 00:31:08,220
Is she being possessed?

548
00:31:11,840 --> 00:31:14,500
She should be acting Hamada-san, what's that?

549
00:31:20,040 --> 00:31:22,930
Eh? Did Minekishi laughed just now?

550
00:31:30,090 --> 00:31:30,860
Minekishi is close

551
00:31:33,800 --> 00:31:35,000
Still not done yet?

552
00:31:35,870 --> 00:31:37,310
That's so freaking long

553
00:31:39,090 --> 00:31:40,300
How is that Hamada-san?

554
00:31:40,300 --> 00:31:43,350
When did Hamada-san look like this?

555
00:31:43,350 --> 00:31:45,480
It's the Hamada-san when he looks at me

556
00:31:46,180 --> 00:31:49,800
This is the face when he looks at me   -So that's all?

557
00:31:49,800 --> 00:31:50,910
Yes, that's all

558
00:31:52,130 --> 00:31:56,200
Oh dear, my friend is over there, hello!

559
00:32:00,380 --> 00:32:03,930
That's hilarious

560
00:32:03,930 --> 00:32:05,640
How did they even hold back on that

561
00:32:07,180 --> 00:32:10,390
That scene just now was hilarious   -In an instant

562
00:32:13,380 --> 00:32:14,630
That's invincible

563
00:32:15,390 --> 00:32:18,250
The hellish hairstyle sisters

564
00:32:18,250 --> 00:32:20,880
That's so strong

565
00:32:20,880 --> 00:32:23,390
Their defense is so strong

566
00:32:23,800 --> 00:32:25,560
Here I come

567
00:32:25,560 --> 00:32:26,870
I'm Egashira-chan

568
00:32:29,050 --> 00:32:30,980
I'm Egashira-chan   -This is awesome too

569
00:32:34,850 --> 00:32:36,340
I'm Egashira-chan

570
00:32:37,110 --> 00:32:38,730
Something amazing came

571
00:32:39,910 --> 00:32:41,060
This is awful

572
00:32:41,770 --> 00:32:44,290
I'm Egashira-chan, who are you?

573
00:32:44,290 --> 00:32:45,180
I'm fleeing soldier

574
00:32:45,450 --> 00:32:46,560
Fleeing soldier?

575
00:32:46,560 --> 00:32:48,220
Why are we the same?

576
00:32:54,490 --> 00:32:56,490
They all look the same

577
00:32:56,490 --> 00:32:59,580
Minekishi was close   -I think Minekishi actually laughed

578
00:32:59,580 --> 00:33:01,880
It's time to take her down though

579
00:33:01,880 --> 00:33:03,680
Hamaguchi-san, why don't you do this with us?

580
00:33:03,680 --> 00:33:05,260
Still lacking a fatal blow

581
00:33:05,260 --> 00:33:07,090
Hamaguchi-san, what are you doing?

582
00:33:08,400 --> 00:33:10,210
What are you doing?

583
00:33:18,270 --> 00:33:19,420
This is absolutely hilarious

584
00:33:22,690 --> 00:33:24,380
She is hilarious

585
00:33:24,380 --> 00:33:26,620
This one is so funny

586
00:33:28,220 --> 00:33:29,870
That was hilarious

587
00:33:29,870 --> 00:33:31,910
Why aren't they laughing?

588
00:33:32,740 --> 00:33:37,370
Hyottoko mask is awful   -That was incredible

589
00:33:38,080 --> 00:33:40,670
It was hell just now   -Sure it is

590
00:33:42,040 --> 00:33:46,000
Hamaguchi took all the attention

591
00:33:46,000 --> 00:33:48,290
How did she come up with this idea

592
00:33:48,290 --> 00:33:51,780
At this rate, Hamaguchi may possibly win the contest

593
00:33:52,870 --> 00:33:55,850
Do you gals do any beauty treatments?

594
00:33:55,850 --> 00:34:01,790
Well, just the normal ones, in routine

595
00:34:02,740 --> 00:34:06,160
I have a machine here that can show your pores

596
00:34:06,620 --> 00:34:08,870
No way, I don't want that   -A machine that shows your pores?

597
00:34:08,870 --> 00:34:11,640
I bet mines are clogged   -But you're young

598
00:34:11,640 --> 00:34:13,290
Nah, it must be clogged

599
00:34:13,750 --> 00:34:15,470
That's so scary   -Let's have a look

600
00:34:16,490 --> 00:34:18,840
But I always go to the beauty salon so...

601
00:34:18,840 --> 00:34:21,250
Yeah, you're skin is beautiful   -It should be fine

602
00:34:21,250 --> 00:34:23,840
What's this? I'm so scared. From my nose?

603
00:34:26,290 --> 00:34:27,400
It's so dirty

604
00:34:28,280 --> 00:34:29,660
It's super dirty

605
00:34:30,030 --> 00:34:32,480
This guy is so mean   -That's just hair

606
00:34:32,480 --> 00:34:33,300
Hair?

607
00:34:33,830 --> 00:34:35,070
What about Uika?

608
00:34:35,070 --> 00:34:35,590
Me?

609
00:34:39,530 --> 00:34:40,260
Huh?

610
00:34:42,020 --> 00:34:43,410
We can see you

611
00:34:45,360 --> 00:34:48,880
What the heck is she doing? Did she miss something?

612
00:34:48,880 --> 00:34:50,880
Why did she opened it?

613
00:34:51,270 --> 00:34:54,380
*Kyoko is imitating her father Animal Hamaguchi

614
00:34:51,270 --> 00:34:54,380
Kyoko!

615
00:34:54,600 --> 00:34:57,060
It all ends in a second

616
00:34:57,060 --> 00:34:59,180
What was that?   -Is it over?

617
00:34:59,650 --> 00:35:01,020
That's amazing

618
00:35:01,020 --> 00:35:02,850
Your hair is so thick

619
00:35:03,450 --> 00:35:04,850
Someone's here   -Who is it?

620
00:35:04,850 --> 00:35:07,960
This room is so dry   -Who are you?

621
00:35:22,770 --> 00:35:23,500
Who are you?

622
00:35:23,790 --> 00:35:27,220
This room is so freaking dry   -Who are you?

623
00:35:27,220 --> 00:35:29,310
Don't tell me she is...

624
00:35:29,600 --> 00:35:30,970
Seriously?

625
00:35:31,280 --> 00:35:33,360
Is she acting Matsumoto-san?

626
00:35:33,360 --> 00:35:36,020
Who is this imitating me though?   -She's Asahi

627
00:35:36,020 --> 00:35:37,040
Ah, she's Asahi

628
00:35:37,040 --> 00:35:39,190
It's so freaking dry

629
00:35:42,400 --> 00:35:44,880
She probably heard that phrase somewhere

630
00:35:44,880 --> 00:35:46,740
I don't care about anything else

631
00:35:47,190 --> 00:35:48,770
Where are you from?

632
00:35:48,770 --> 00:35:50,240
You don't recognize me?

633
00:35:51,020 --> 00:35:52,660
Those nipples are erecting

634
00:35:52,660 --> 00:35:54,840
I never met you before right?

635
00:35:54,840 --> 00:35:58,040
No way, Uika-chan   -Eh? I've met you before?

636
00:35:58,040 --> 00:35:59,170
I'm Matsumoto Hitoshi

637
00:36:01,690 --> 00:36:04,560
It's so dry here right?

638
00:36:04,560 --> 00:36:06,390
Did you say it that frequently?

639
00:36:07,160 --> 00:36:08,460
Your nipples are erecting

640
00:36:08,460 --> 00:36:10,260
Of course, because it's so dry here

641
00:36:10,260 --> 00:36:12,120
Because it's dry?

642
00:36:12,120 --> 00:36:15,630
Matsumoto-san only do chest workouts, no wonder why his chest looks amazing

643
00:36:15,630 --> 00:36:18,370
Yeah I know, but I actually did none of those workouts

644
00:36:18,370 --> 00:36:20,110
Why did you start working out?

645
00:36:20,850 --> 00:36:25,200
Well, since I got married, there's
a lot of things that I need to protect right?

646
00:36:27,550 --> 00:36:29,170
Well, this is just a lie though

647
00:36:30,490 --> 00:36:32,310
It's so dry, are you fine with this?

648
00:36:35,400 --> 00:36:37,260
The intersperse of this line is interesting

649
00:36:37,620 --> 00:36:40,400
That's all she got though   -This intersperse is interesting

650
00:36:41,600 --> 00:36:43,300
Matsumoto-san

651
00:36:43,410 --> 00:36:45,130
Shall we play the Pop-up Pirate?

652
00:36:45,130 --> 00:36:50,550
Then the person who loses need to drink the bitter tea in one breath

653
00:36:50,550 --> 00:36:54,490
In one breath?   -Yeah, that's more interesting

654
00:36:55,270 --> 00:36:56,660
It's gonna make me go to the bathroom

655
00:36:58,320 --> 00:36:59,500
It's gonna make me go to the bathroom

656
00:36:59,500 --> 00:37:01,370
How many times are you going to say that

657
00:37:02,970 --> 00:37:04,370
It's definitely gonna make me go to the bathroom

658
00:37:04,370 --> 00:37:06,680
Nothing we can do about it, please just endure

659
00:37:06,680 --> 00:37:08,440
I'll choose here then

660
00:37:10,860 --> 00:37:11,380
In one breath?

661
00:37:11,380 --> 00:37:14,140
La-la-last person wants to drink the tea

662
00:37:14,140 --> 00:37:17,000
She likes it, she likes it, she can't stop it

663
00:37:17,000 --> 00:37:19,780
Oh, yeah, it sure is tea
(La-la-last person wants to drink the tea)

664
00:37:19,780 --> 00:37:22,870
She likes it, she likes it, she can't stop it

665
00:37:22,870 --> 00:37:24,820
Come on, in one breath
(La-la-last person wants to drink the tea)

666
00:37:24,820 --> 00:37:26,710
It's really concentrated   -Come on, in one breath

667
00:37:28,420 --> 00:37:31,810
It's not about concentrated or not   -Come on, this is a Batsu game

668
00:37:31,810 --> 00:37:35,180
In one breath, come on, in one breath

669
00:37:36,700 --> 00:37:38,400
The flute drinking style

670
00:37:39,510 --> 00:37:42,530
That's old, flute drinking style is old
(She likes it, she likes it, she can't stop it)

671
00:37:44,570 --> 00:37:46,940
Just drink it quickly, my hands really hurt

672
00:37:46,940 --> 00:37:49,280
It's troublesome to shout these slogans   -Really?

673
00:37:49,280 --> 00:37:53,590
She's losing her patience
(Just drink it quickly, my hands really hurt)

674
00:37:53,950 --> 00:37:58,840
Slow, slow, you're so slow   -So many variations

675
00:37:58,840 --> 00:38:00,600
Slow, slow, you're so slow

676
00:38:00,600 --> 00:38:03,080
Is it necessary to drink it in several rounds?

677
00:38:03,770 --> 00:38:04,900
I can't drink it

678
00:38:04,900 --> 00:38:08,730
You drank all of it   -This is my limit, I can't drink anymore

679
00:38:09,730 --> 00:38:12,940
You look down, are you okay?

680
00:38:15,350 --> 00:38:19,530
If you need anything, just let us know   -I want some water

681
00:38:19,530 --> 00:38:22,240
Please drink it then

682
00:38:22,240 --> 00:38:25,920
I see, so she's just thirty   -Yeah, because she did a dance

683
00:38:25,920 --> 00:38:28,990
Thank you very much   -And she's really polite too

684
00:38:28,990 --> 00:38:33,690
On your way, on your way, on your way to hell

685
00:38:39,530 --> 00:38:41,590
She let her guard down

686
00:38:42,350 --> 00:38:44,240
She just let her guard down

687
00:38:46,180 --> 00:38:47,740
Second time?

688
00:38:47,740 --> 00:38:49,670
Second time

689
00:38:50,450 --> 00:38:52,260
What a pity!

690
00:38:52,810 --> 00:38:53,990
I wanted to watch more

691
00:38:53,990 --> 00:38:56,650
And this tastes so bad right?   -It tastes really bad

692
00:38:57,140 --> 00:39:00,710
Isn't this tea?   -It's bitter tea

693
00:39:01,920 --> 00:39:04,090
She drank all of it with a poker face

694
00:39:04,090 --> 00:39:06,430
I bet everyone noticed this...

695
00:39:07,390 --> 00:39:08,270
Kyoko-san

696
00:39:09,500 --> 00:39:11,120
You're out!

697
00:39:17,890 --> 00:39:20,380
Your smile was refreshing

698
00:39:20,880 --> 00:39:21,950
I laughed

699
00:39:23,120 --> 00:39:26,320
Thank you very much   -And she's really polite too

700
00:39:26,320 --> 00:39:30,330
On your way, on your way, on your way to hell

701
00:39:33,210 --> 00:39:37,090
Eh, Kyoko-san is leaving?   -I really had a good time!

702
00:39:37,090 --> 00:39:39,690
She's back to her usual self   -That's great

703
00:39:45,920 --> 00:39:47,300
Let's start

704
00:39:52,360 --> 00:39:55,470
I actually wanted to ask for some advice from you gals

705
00:39:55,470 --> 00:39:57,890
Would you mind listening to me?   -Of course

706
00:39:58,870 --> 00:40:00,050
That's quite rare

707
00:40:00,050 --> 00:40:01,480
What could it be?

708
00:40:01,720 --> 00:40:05,260
It's about the icon for SNS   -Ah, I see

709
00:40:05,260 --> 00:40:06,490
That's quite important

710
00:40:06,490 --> 00:40:14,320
So I need some advice about which photo to choose, from all these front line talents

711
00:40:14,320 --> 00:40:18,700
-Remove your makeup first
-Come on Kaneda, we can't even recognize you now

712
00:40:19,790 --> 00:40:23,100
Beautiful   -So cute

713
00:40:23,200 --> 00:40:24,150
It's Uika

714
00:40:26,310 --> 00:40:28,930
I love this one, it looks so shiny

715
00:40:29,210 --> 00:40:31,900
I thought this one is quite good too

716
00:40:31,900 --> 00:40:34,060
And this one looks good too

717
00:40:38,670 --> 00:40:39,930
Hetake-san from Sharam Q

718
00:40:41,410 --> 00:40:45,740
I'm hesitating between these two photos

719
00:40:46,890 --> 00:40:49,740
This one looks more natural though   -Minekishi...

720
00:40:49,740 --> 00:40:53,260
Did she laugh?   -Minekishi is...

721
00:40:53,260 --> 00:40:55,920
She's in danger   -Is she out already?

722
00:40:56,360 --> 00:40:57,940
Who is this?

723
00:41:00,020 --> 00:41:01,050
Who do you mean?

724
00:41:01,050 --> 00:41:02,930
The one in between

725
00:41:02,930 --> 00:41:04,740
This one?   -This one

726
00:41:04,740 --> 00:41:05,980
This is Hatake-san

727
00:41:07,300 --> 00:41:09,430
Hatake-san? From Sharam Q?

728
00:41:11,770 --> 00:41:14,300
They probably don't know about Hatake-san right?

729
00:41:14,300 --> 00:41:16,610
Yeah, maybe they can't get the gag here

730
00:41:16,610 --> 00:41:18,870
I can't decide which photo to choose   -Hatake from Sharam Q

731
00:41:23,910 --> 00:41:25,860
That was a nice one

732
00:41:25,860 --> 00:41:28,670
You're purposely showing it to me so many times!

733
00:41:28,980 --> 00:41:30,750
This is amazing   -Eh? Hatake-san?

734
00:41:30,750 --> 00:41:34,390
And I thought there's only one photo of Hatake-san, but then there's actually another one

735
00:41:34,390 --> 00:41:36,660
It's really satisfying to get this one

736
00:41:37,060 --> 00:41:40,050
Playing into her hands

737
00:41:44,050 --> 00:41:45,300
Minegishi-san

738
00:41:45,940 --> 00:41:46,970
Yellow card

739
00:41:46,970 --> 00:41:49,700
Yes, I have no excuse   -Well...

740
00:41:49,700 --> 00:41:55,450
Minegishi actually almost laughed all the time   -Yeah, she was

741
00:41:55,450 --> 00:41:56,760
You couldn't hold back right?

742
00:41:57,500 --> 00:41:58,580
Let's take a look

743
00:42:00,440 --> 00:42:01,920
Hatake-san? From Sharam Q?

744
00:42:05,040 --> 00:42:06,830
Uika did a good job here

745
00:42:06,830 --> 00:42:10,140
Yeah, that smooth flip through photos was too perfect

746
00:42:11,800 --> 00:42:16,210
It was perfect   -Yeah, the timing of those flips was perfect

747
00:42:16,760 --> 00:42:19,020
So one more hour left now

748
00:42:19,730 --> 00:42:22,560
Good luck everyone

749
00:42:23,520 --> 00:42:26,360
Zero times?   -Yukipoto is zero times too?

750
00:42:26,360 --> 00:42:27,240
Three of us are zero

751
00:42:28,540 --> 00:42:30,080
Uika-san is zero too?   -Yes, zero

752
00:42:30,880 --> 00:42:32,220
So it's one, one, and one right?

753
00:42:36,820 --> 00:42:41,910
Maybe it's about time for me to do another imitation

754
00:42:43,020 --> 00:42:45,350
Again?   -She's quite aggressive

755
00:42:45,350 --> 00:42:47,110
How many cards do she have in her hand

756
00:42:47,110 --> 00:42:49,700
I watched "E.T." again recently

757
00:42:49,700 --> 00:42:51,910
Ah, that movie "E.T." right?

758
00:42:51,910 --> 00:42:53,190
"E.T."

759
00:43:00,240 --> 00:43:01,230
Very impressive

760
00:43:03,040 --> 00:43:07,190
Her makeup adds to the imitation too   -Yeah, you're right

761
00:43:07,190 --> 00:43:08,730
She probably didn't do it on purpose though

762
00:43:09,430 --> 00:43:13,280
Really well done for them to hold on   -E.T.

763
00:43:15,310 --> 00:43:16,350
Are you okay?

764
00:43:24,190 --> 00:43:26,070
That's not the face of a girl

765
00:43:30,970 --> 00:43:32,910
This is horrible   -You want to be friends with me?

766
00:43:32,910 --> 00:43:37,370
E~T~

767
00:43:39,260 --> 00:43:41,220
Asahi is joining too

768
00:43:43,820 --> 00:43:46,480
It's probably better to join this

769
00:43:46,480 --> 00:43:48,480
They are starting to echo

770
00:43:51,510 --> 00:43:52,340
Uika is in danger

771
00:43:52,340 --> 00:43:55,990
Uika! Uika! Uika!

772
00:43:59,060 --> 00:44:00,280
I don't know what I'm doing, but...

773
00:44:01,980 --> 00:44:03,840
Friends!

774
00:44:06,610 --> 00:44:09,250
Maybe she's actually laughing here

775
00:44:09,670 --> 00:44:11,200
Thank you so much

776
00:44:11,370 --> 00:44:12,070
Here she comes

777
00:44:12,730 --> 00:44:13,500
Someone's coming

778
00:44:16,250 --> 00:44:18,060
What is it?

779
00:44:20,660 --> 00:44:25,850
That's incredible   -Oh my god, that's amazing

780
00:44:26,440 --> 00:44:28,420
The quality is top notch

781
00:44:30,510 --> 00:44:32,160
This is unbelievable

782
00:44:32,160 --> 00:44:33,790
Are you Gachapin-san?

783
00:44:32,160 --> 00:44:34,620
*Gachapin is a popular Japanese television character who appeared in the children's program Hirake! Ponkikki

784
00:44:33,790 --> 00:44:34,620
I'm Gachapin

785
00:44:35,460 --> 00:44:36,950
The costume is really well done

786
00:44:36,950 --> 00:44:39,920
That's amazing, no wonder she disappeared for such a long time

787
00:44:40,320 --> 00:44:42,270
They look alike though

788
00:44:42,270 --> 00:44:43,880
Yeah, she looks like Gachapin

789
00:44:43,880 --> 00:44:44,950
I can do anything

790
00:44:44,950 --> 00:44:46,100
Anything?

791
00:44:48,590 --> 00:44:49,860
What can Gachapin do?

792
00:44:51,610 --> 00:44:52,980
What the heck?

793
00:44:55,190 --> 00:44:57,500
How is this Gachapin?   -That's not it's character setting

794
00:44:58,880 --> 00:44:59,630
Why a cartwheel?

795
00:44:59,630 --> 00:45:03,340
Probably because Gachipin is good at sports, but still...

796
00:45:03,600 --> 00:45:06,080
But still, why did she choose to do a cartwheel

797
00:45:13,880 --> 00:45:15,380
Who is that?   -She's Yukipoyo

798
00:45:15,380 --> 00:45:17,380
*Sento-kun is a yuru-chara mascot created by Nara City Office to commemorate the 1300th anniversary of Nara Heijō-kyō

799
00:45:15,380 --> 00:45:17,380
Yukipoyo is acting Sento-kun

800
00:45:17,450 --> 00:45:18,580
The music is so loud

801
00:45:22,730 --> 00:45:24,870
She's doing the Para Para dance

802
00:45:37,050 --> 00:45:40,130
Gachapin is dancing together

803
00:45:51,130 --> 00:45:52,930
Is this going to work?

804
00:45:59,560 --> 00:46:01,040
Gachapin is dancing like crazy

805
00:46:09,840 --> 00:46:12,090
They're dancing like Kōji Kikkawa and Ann Lewis

806
00:46:13,780 --> 00:46:17,760
Their minds are in sync   -Good teamwork despite being improvised

807
00:46:26,930 --> 00:46:30,770
What's up with these people? They are amazing!

808
00:46:30,770 --> 00:46:33,700
This would probably get a big laugh even in Documental

809
00:46:34,220 --> 00:46:39,830
Minekishi scored many aggressive points here

810
00:46:40,200 --> 00:46:46,450
But I ruined Yukipoyo's Para para dance

811
00:46:46,450 --> 00:46:48,030
I'm so sorry   -No problem...

812
00:46:51,360 --> 00:46:52,590
I'm so sorry

813
00:46:53,790 --> 00:46:55,750
She's attacking   -This guy is crazy

814
00:46:57,100 --> 00:46:59,130
She's very close   -I'm so sorry

815
00:47:08,830 --> 00:47:10,380
She successfully took her down

816
00:47:10,880 --> 00:47:13,840
This is amazing

817
00:47:13,840 --> 00:47:15,330
Yeah, it's incredible

818
00:47:15,330 --> 00:47:20,260
This is really impressive   -A nice fight

819
00:47:20,260 --> 00:47:22,260
Well done   -She was aggressive

820
00:47:25,300 --> 00:47:27,650
Yukipoyo, yellow card

821
00:47:28,640 --> 00:47:29,690
Nothing I can do about it

822
00:47:31,070 --> 00:47:32,640
That one was cunning

823
00:47:32,640 --> 00:47:35,470
That battle was really impressive

824
00:47:36,880 --> 00:47:37,980
I'm so sorry

825
00:47:38,750 --> 00:47:41,140
She's attacking   -This guy is crazy

826
00:47:43,290 --> 00:47:44,470
She's very close   -I'm so sorry

827
00:47:50,200 --> 00:47:52,370
Minekishi scored many points now

828
00:47:52,370 --> 00:47:53,780
Thank you very much

829
00:47:53,780 --> 00:47:54,920
I'm glad that I did this

830
00:47:56,080 --> 00:47:57,880
Let's start

831
00:48:00,680 --> 00:48:02,780
The last spurt

832
00:48:02,780 --> 00:48:05,890
I would like to sing a song

833
00:48:07,420 --> 00:48:09,690
Judy Ongg-san's "Miserarete (Falling in love with you)"

834
00:48:09,690 --> 00:48:11,530
With no music

835
00:48:11,530 --> 00:48:13,090
Please sing a cappella for us then

836
00:48:16,260 --> 00:48:18,870
I don't know the lyrics though   -You don't?

837
00:48:18,870 --> 00:48:21,470
Is this how you sing that song?   -No, it's not

838
00:48:22,440 --> 00:48:26,610
"Face the south, and open the cur... window"

839
00:48:26,610 --> 00:48:30,950
"Gaze off into the distance, the color of the sea"

840
00:48:30,950 --> 00:48:33,750
"It's too beautiful, it's too terrifying"

841
00:48:33,750 --> 00:48:36,520
"Just like youth"

842
00:48:36,520 --> 00:48:39,450
"The mirage at noon"

843
00:48:48,000 --> 00:48:49,260
Wait, what's next?

844
00:48:49,260 --> 00:48:50,970
Eh...?

845
00:48:55,240 --> 00:48:56,470
I laughed right?

846
00:48:58,070 --> 00:48:59,270
So it's me

847
00:48:59,270 --> 00:49:02,440
I actually warned myself not to laugh though

848
00:49:02,440 --> 00:49:04,810
That was hilarious

849
00:49:04,810 --> 00:49:06,050
That was so funny

850
00:49:06,050 --> 00:49:08,350
It must be me

851
00:49:08,350 --> 00:49:11,190
I know I shouldn't laugh at my own gags, and I'm aware of it

852
00:49:11,190 --> 00:49:13,360
Yes I know   -But then I really enjoyed doing it

853
00:49:13,360 --> 00:49:15,020
Yeah, you enjoyed it

854
00:49:15,020 --> 00:49:16,490
And slowly let your guard down

855
00:49:16,490 --> 00:49:19,130
Matsuno-san, you're out

856
00:49:19,560 --> 00:49:20,230
Nothing I can do about it

857
00:49:25,570 --> 00:49:28,700
Goodbye everyone, wait...

858
00:49:28,840 --> 00:49:31,770
I really didn't want to laugh at my own gags

859
00:49:31,770 --> 00:49:32,710
We will be careful

860
00:49:37,150 --> 00:49:39,080
If she did that for a bit longer, I'll be out

861
00:49:39,080 --> 00:49:40,120
Oh, really?

862
00:49:40,120 --> 00:49:42,750
That first line was ridiculously funny

863
00:49:43,850 --> 00:49:48,220
"Face the south, and open the cur... window"

864
00:49:48,220 --> 00:49:49,190
"Gaze off into the distance..."

865
00:49:49,990 --> 00:49:51,430
Let's continue

866
00:49:52,660 --> 00:49:55,130
Last 30 minutes now

867
00:49:55,130 --> 00:49:56,800
That was amazing

868
00:49:56,800 --> 00:49:59,200
Let's see what Asahi is doing

869
00:49:59,200 --> 00:50:00,070
Here she comes

870
00:50:02,200 --> 00:50:03,940
So cute

871
00:50:03,940 --> 00:50:05,870
What does she want to do?

872
00:50:06,840 --> 00:50:09,210
What is she trying to do?

873
00:50:09,210 --> 00:50:11,350
Shimura-san's...

874
00:50:11,350 --> 00:50:13,650
But Shimura-san didn't do anything like this

875
00:50:13,880 --> 00:50:15,620
Yeah, he didn't

876
00:50:15,620 --> 00:50:16,990
It's just the same costume

877
00:50:16,990 --> 00:50:18,950
What inspired her to do this?

878
00:50:18,950 --> 00:50:20,820
What kind of gag is this?

879
00:50:27,900 --> 00:50:28,830
She went back

880
00:50:29,660 --> 00:50:32,070
She went back...   -I see, so that's it

881
00:50:32,400 --> 00:50:33,840
A beautiful ballerina

882
00:50:33,840 --> 00:50:35,840
She was really cute

883
00:50:35,840 --> 00:50:40,640
By the way, anyone want to battle me?

884
00:50:40,640 --> 00:50:42,240
For what?

885
00:50:42,240 --> 00:50:43,580
Stocking sumo wrestling

886
00:50:44,410 --> 00:50:45,910
Stocking sumo wrestling?

887
00:50:45,910 --> 00:50:47,420
I never did this before though

888
00:50:47,420 --> 00:50:49,420
I never did this before too, how should I do?

889
00:50:49,420 --> 00:50:52,420
I'm not sure, but maybe wear this on your head and do sumo right?

890
00:50:52,420 --> 00:50:54,520
And move in opposite direction

891
00:50:54,520 --> 00:50:56,620
This is quite tough

892
00:50:56,960 --> 00:51:00,030
I'm full of Kaneda's grimace

893
00:51:00,030 --> 00:51:02,300
Yeah, even if she do it again...

894
00:51:03,770 --> 00:51:07,100
She has to add something new   -You're right

895
00:51:07,440 --> 00:51:09,070
How come she knows how to do this

896
00:51:13,140 --> 00:51:14,980
Her face is amazing

897
00:51:16,540 --> 00:51:17,680
Stop it please, stop it

898
00:51:17,680 --> 00:51:18,710
Does it suit me?

899
00:51:18,710 --> 00:51:19,850
It suits, it suits

900
00:51:20,620 --> 00:51:22,250
We're in the same color

901
00:51:22,250 --> 00:51:23,750
The same color

902
00:51:23,750 --> 00:51:25,390
Hey, hey, the same color

903
00:51:26,350 --> 00:51:27,720
The same color, so what

904
00:51:27,720 --> 00:51:29,290
Does it suit me? Do I look pretty?

905
00:51:30,590 --> 00:51:31,830
Both of you are looking gorgeous

906
00:51:31,830 --> 00:51:33,630
Who looks more gorgeous?

907
00:51:33,960 --> 00:51:37,070
Hey, will I be able to get married?

908
00:51:38,930 --> 00:51:40,170
Yeah, sure you can

909
00:51:40,170 --> 00:51:41,900
Her face turns out to be quite funny

910
00:51:41,900 --> 00:51:44,710
It's amazing, oh my god...

911
00:51:44,710 --> 00:51:46,610
I'm so sorry

912
00:51:46,610 --> 00:51:48,410
I'm really sorry

913
00:51:49,140 --> 00:51:51,010
I'm so sorry

914
00:51:51,610 --> 00:51:52,980
Her face is horrible

915
00:51:54,480 --> 00:51:56,120
This is incredible

916
00:51:56,650 --> 00:51:57,990
I never saw that kind of face

917
00:52:01,420 --> 00:52:03,760
Her face is hilarious

918
00:52:05,330 --> 00:52:06,730
Good boy, good boy...

919
00:52:08,900 --> 00:52:11,570
Why is she giving that thing a stroke?

920
00:52:11,570 --> 00:52:13,130
This is awful

921
00:52:15,040 --> 00:52:17,440
Asahi is in danger, Asahi is in danger

922
00:52:17,440 --> 00:52:19,670
She's the one who brought this item

923
00:52:19,670 --> 00:52:21,880
It feels bad to let others stroke your item

924
00:52:22,240 --> 00:52:23,810
This is just awful

925
00:52:26,550 --> 00:52:29,520
Hotaru...Hotaru...

926
00:52:29,520 --> 00:52:31,050
She keeps saying "Hotaru"

927
00:52:33,520 --> 00:52:36,620
Eh? "Kitano Kuni Kara"?

928
00:52:33,520 --> 00:52:37,860
*"Kitano Kuni Kara (From a North Country)" is a famous Japanese drama, and "Hotaru" is the eldest daughter of the protagonist Gorou

929
00:52:36,620 --> 00:52:37,860
So she's acting Gorou-san

930
00:52:37,860 --> 00:52:41,030
No way, I don't even stand a chance to hold back on that one

931
00:52:41,330 --> 00:52:43,030
It's definitely impossible for me

932
00:52:43,430 --> 00:52:46,500
So last 15 minutes   -Only 15 minutes left

933
00:52:47,640 --> 00:52:48,740
Mom...

934
00:52:49,100 --> 00:52:50,000
That's incredible

935
00:52:50,970 --> 00:52:51,970
That's incredible

936
00:52:51,970 --> 00:52:53,980
She can't find her mom?

937
00:52:55,080 --> 00:52:55,910
You can't find your mommy?

938
00:52:58,150 --> 00:52:59,780
Are you finding your mommy?

939
00:52:59,780 --> 00:53:02,020
Yes, I'm finding my mommy

940
00:53:04,750 --> 00:53:06,190
She laughed

941
00:53:10,430 --> 00:53:12,030
Eh? Uika-san?

942
00:53:12,030 --> 00:53:14,400
What happened? I didn't saw that

943
00:53:14,400 --> 00:53:17,630
Come on, last 15...14 minutes

944
00:53:17,630 --> 00:53:21,700
Uika, you've been doing a good job holding back all the time, why did you laugh at that?

945
00:53:22,500 --> 00:53:23,670
Because she's so pitiful

946
00:53:27,040 --> 00:53:28,340
Are you finding your mommy?

947
00:53:28,340 --> 00:53:30,580
Yes, I'm finding my mommy

948
00:53:34,350 --> 00:53:36,850
But this is the first time for Uika, so yellow card

949
00:53:36,850 --> 00:53:38,390
Oh no

950
00:53:38,990 --> 00:53:43,730
The contest is now nip-and-tuck

951
00:53:43,790 --> 00:53:46,230
Probably now one will be out anymore

952
00:53:46,230 --> 00:53:48,860
So it all comes down to points

953
00:53:48,860 --> 00:53:51,870
Last 15 minutes

954
00:53:51,870 --> 00:53:54,270
Good luck everybody   -Thank you

955
00:53:54,270 --> 00:53:56,170
Damn it

956
00:54:00,580 --> 00:54:02,040
Let's start

957
00:54:05,410 --> 00:54:07,320
So how do we play stocking sumo?

958
00:54:07,320 --> 00:54:10,320
Yeah, I really want to watch stocking sumo

959
00:54:10,320 --> 00:54:13,290
We just move in opposite direction right?   -Yes

960
00:54:13,290 --> 00:54:15,220
They're still continuing with stocking sumo?

961
00:54:16,820 --> 00:54:21,360
She's wearing a stocking, which is even longer than her legs

962
00:54:23,900 --> 00:54:25,530
She did it   -This is fun

963
00:54:25,530 --> 00:54:27,400
Wow, you look like a different person

964
00:54:28,040 --> 00:54:31,170
Eh? Oh my god!

965
00:54:31,610 --> 00:54:33,510
*Senpuki Obasan is a korean famous for having failed cosmetic surgery and her face lost original figure

966
00:54:31,610 --> 00:54:33,510
She looks like Senpuki Obasan

967
00:54:34,410 --> 00:54:36,680
Kanetomo laughed just now right?

968
00:54:36,680 --> 00:54:37,280
Eh? Who?

969
00:54:37,280 --> 00:54:38,710
Kanetomo, she's Kaneda

970
00:54:41,150 --> 00:54:43,920
Did she laugh? I'm not sure

971
00:54:43,920 --> 00:54:46,190
I think so, she laughed slightly

972
00:54:47,590 --> 00:54:49,120
While wearing the stocking...

973
00:54:49,120 --> 00:54:50,120
And laughed out

974
00:54:51,260 --> 00:54:52,490
She laughed for sure

975
00:54:54,060 --> 00:54:58,100
Well, I probably missed it, but...

976
00:54:58,430 --> 00:54:59,970
Kaneda-san laughed right?

977
00:54:59,970 --> 00:55:01,440
Eh? Really?

978
00:55:01,440 --> 00:55:02,270
Really?

979
00:55:02,270 --> 00:55:05,870
They said she clearly laughed even under the socking

980
00:55:05,870 --> 00:55:07,940
Let's take a look

981
00:55:10,280 --> 00:55:11,950
This is amazing

982
00:55:15,320 --> 00:55:17,520
She laughed out a bit

983
00:55:17,520 --> 00:55:18,790
Yeah, she laughed slightly

984
00:55:18,790 --> 00:55:20,050
She's having fun

985
00:55:20,050 --> 00:55:21,760
But it's the first time for Kaneda-san right?   -Yes

986
00:55:21,760 --> 00:55:23,760
Eh, so...

987
00:55:23,760 --> 00:55:24,930
We all received a yellow card

988
00:55:24,930 --> 00:55:26,930
We're all given yellow cards?   -Yes, everyone

989
00:55:26,930 --> 00:55:28,000
So everyone received a yellow card

990
00:55:32,400 --> 00:55:33,470
Let's continue

991
00:55:34,600 --> 00:55:36,340
10 more minutes

992
00:55:37,000 --> 00:55:39,170
They didn't even start pulling

993
00:55:39,170 --> 00:55:40,210
Yeah, the sumo is not started yet

994
00:55:42,540 --> 00:55:43,680
Nice face

995
00:55:44,150 --> 00:55:46,380
Her face changed completely   -This is incredible

996
00:55:46,710 --> 00:55:48,780
What's so "incredible", dude

997
00:55:48,780 --> 00:55:50,920
I'll hold this in the middle

998
00:55:51,320 --> 00:55:54,160
Okay, so start pulling now

999
00:55:54,160 --> 00:55:55,720
OK

1000
00:55:55,720 --> 00:55:58,530
Ready, set, go!

1001
00:55:58,790 --> 00:55:59,660
So strong

1002
00:55:59,660 --> 00:56:02,260
Come on, who are you even trying to make laugh of?

1003
00:56:02,260 --> 00:56:04,300
They're heading to the same direction

1004
00:56:04,300 --> 00:56:05,430
This is just hurting the neck

1005
00:56:05,430 --> 00:56:07,440
Who are you even trying to make laugh of?

1006
00:56:09,740 --> 00:56:11,440
Because they don't know how to do this

1007
00:56:11,440 --> 00:56:12,870
Yeah, this is ridiculous

1008
00:56:12,870 --> 00:56:15,140
They're moving in the same direction

1009
00:56:16,180 --> 00:56:17,850
Only 10 more minutes left

1010
00:56:17,850 --> 00:56:19,750
Maybe it's better to move on to the next one

1011
00:56:32,860 --> 00:56:34,700
What the heck is this

1012
00:56:36,500 --> 00:56:38,530
It's amazing

1013
00:56:39,230 --> 00:56:40,940
What the heck is this?

1014
00:56:48,010 --> 00:56:49,680
This gal is awful

1015
00:56:51,310 --> 00:56:52,950
Take a photo, take it, take it

1016
00:56:52,950 --> 00:56:57,050
Kaneda-san, only 5 more minutes

1017
00:56:57,050 --> 00:56:59,290
Ah, less than 5 minutes now

1018
00:57:01,160 --> 00:57:02,220
Let's take a look

1019
00:57:02,220 --> 00:57:05,690
If she can show a different photo here

1020
00:57:05,690 --> 00:57:07,860
Like the photo of her being bald

1021
00:57:07,860 --> 00:57:10,500
Maybe it'll get a laugh

1022
00:57:11,330 --> 00:57:12,870
What a face!

1023
00:57:12,870 --> 00:57:14,740
Ah, that seems to be it

1024
00:57:14,740 --> 00:57:16,240
These faces look amazing

1025
00:57:20,070 --> 00:57:21,780
We look like mother and daughter right?

1026
00:57:21,780 --> 00:57:22,780
Quite good

1027
00:57:22,780 --> 00:57:24,310
We're mother and daughter

1028
00:57:24,310 --> 00:57:28,150
If she can show some photos of Hatake-san here

1029
00:57:28,150 --> 00:57:30,150
Sadly, no photos of Hatake-san here

1030
00:57:30,150 --> 00:57:33,490
It'll probably get a laugh if there is one

1031
00:57:34,290 --> 00:57:35,190
Yeah, you're right

1032
00:57:35,190 --> 00:57:40,830
These photos are fabulous

1033
00:57:45,970 --> 00:57:50,910
This is awful

1034
00:57:51,170 --> 00:57:53,210
What the heck is that? So scary

1035
00:57:56,610 --> 00:57:59,280
Oh no, oh no, oh no

1036
00:58:00,780 --> 00:58:04,290
So cute, you're super cute

1037
00:58:04,290 --> 00:58:06,290
Looking good

1038
00:58:06,290 --> 00:58:07,560
So cute

1039
00:58:12,830 --> 00:58:14,600
This is awful

1040
00:58:16,060 --> 00:58:18,530
Yeah, this sure is awful

1041
00:58:20,970 --> 00:58:22,440
Who is she acting?

1042
00:58:22,700 --> 00:58:25,770
Nice, nice, very nice

1043
00:58:31,310 --> 00:58:32,980
Hold on, Minegishi!

1044
00:58:37,150 --> 00:58:41,920
I'm sorry

1045
00:58:57,470 --> 00:59:04,650
I'm sorry

1046
00:59:04,650 --> 00:59:05,780
I'm really sorry

1047
00:59:05,780 --> 00:59:07,580
They're all attacking at once

1048
00:59:07,580 --> 00:59:08,920
Why is everyone attacking her?

1049
00:59:08,920 --> 00:59:10,050
They're all attacking!

1050
00:59:10,050 --> 00:59:11,720
Why is Minegishi being targeted?

1051
00:59:11,720 --> 00:59:12,950
Because she's going to win

1052
00:59:12,950 --> 00:59:16,890
Yeah, Minegishi scored more points

1053
00:59:16,890 --> 00:59:19,590
So they have to take her down

1054
00:59:19,590 --> 00:59:22,030
She's so strong

1055
00:59:22,030 --> 00:59:23,360
I'm really sorry

1056
00:59:23,360 --> 00:59:24,770
I'm serious, I'm really sorry

1057
00:59:24,770 --> 00:59:27,600
Sorry for doing these strange things

1058
00:59:27,600 --> 00:59:29,600
Trying to make you laugh with this strange mask

1059
00:59:29,600 --> 00:59:32,370
I'm sorry, I'm really sorry

1060
00:59:32,370 --> 00:59:35,180
-Despite of belonging to the same generation, I'm so sorry
-Don't tell us your true thoughts

1061
00:59:35,180 --> 00:59:37,680
It's terrible for trying to make people laugh with this

1062
00:59:37,680 --> 00:59:38,810
I'm really sorry

1063
00:59:38,810 --> 00:59:40,550
I'm so sorry!

1064
00:59:40,550 --> 00:59:42,680
You don't seem to be reflecting though

1065
00:59:42,680 --> 00:59:45,250
I'm really sorry!

1066
00:59:45,250 --> 00:59:49,890
I'm so sorry!

1067
00:59:49,890 --> 00:59:53,030
I'm sorry

1068
00:59:53,030 --> 00:59:57,130
I'm really sorry   -Asahi is really doing a good job

1069
00:59:57,130 --> 00:59:58,370
I'm so sorry

1070
00:59:59,470 --> 01:00:00,430
Minami-san

1071
01:00:00,430 --> 01:00:03,140
I'm so sorry for messing around with this

1072
01:00:03,140 --> 01:00:06,210
Last one and a half minute, hold on!

1073
01:00:06,510 --> 01:00:08,540
Hold on, hold on, hold on!

1074
01:00:08,540 --> 01:00:11,250
Please! Hold on!

1075
01:00:11,250 --> 01:00:14,550
Can you please forgive me?

1076
01:00:14,550 --> 01:00:16,180
Minegishi hold on

1077
01:00:16,180 --> 01:00:17,590
Can you forgive me?

1078
01:00:17,590 --> 01:00:19,150
They're both working hard

1079
01:00:19,150 --> 01:00:20,790
This is amazing

1080
01:00:21,760 --> 01:00:23,060
I"m sorry

1081
01:00:24,890 --> 01:00:25,990
I'm sorry   -Ah, no way

1082
01:00:26,990 --> 01:00:28,500
Why did she leave?

1083
01:00:28,500 --> 01:00:30,670
No more time left, it's gonna end

1084
01:00:31,500 --> 01:00:32,800
I'm sorry

1085
01:00:33,500 --> 01:00:35,440
I'm really sorry

1086
01:00:35,440 --> 01:00:37,100
Here she comes, here she comes!

1087
01:00:37,100 --> 01:00:39,610
She's in danger, she's in danger!

1088
01:00:41,910 --> 01:00:43,740
It's impossible to forgive me right?

1089
01:00:44,450 --> 01:00:46,810
Of course, I'm the worst

1090
01:00:46,810 --> 01:00:50,350
I'm sorry, I'm the worst, I'm the worst!

1091
01:00:51,120 --> 01:00:53,920
I'm the worst! Stupid! Stupid!

1092
01:00:53,920 --> 01:00:56,790
I'm the worst! I'm seriously the worst!

1093
01:00:56,790 --> 01:00:59,330
How could I do something like this to my senior

1094
01:00:59,330 --> 01:01:00,460
I'm the worst

1095
01:01:00,460 --> 01:01:03,100
I'm sorry

1096
01:01:03,100 --> 01:01:05,330
I'm sorry, I'm really sorry

1097
01:01:10,370 --> 01:01:11,810
Eh? It ended?

1098
01:01:12,710 --> 01:01:13,840
Who wins?

1099
01:01:13,840 --> 01:01:16,910
I don't know, maybe no one?

1100
01:01:16,910 --> 01:01:20,110
It was so funny, it's too funny

1101
01:01:21,680 --> 01:01:22,780
Thank you all

1102
01:01:28,490 --> 01:01:30,120
Nice fight

1103
01:01:31,530 --> 01:01:33,660
It was amazing, very funny

1104
01:01:33,660 --> 01:01:38,370
I've yelled "keep it up!" louder than any sports competition that I've ever watched

1105
01:01:39,300 --> 01:01:42,400
So according to everyone's opinion

1106
01:01:42,400 --> 01:01:45,140
We've decided a winner

1107
01:01:45,140 --> 01:01:46,740
The honorable victory belongs to...

1108
01:01:50,680 --> 01:01:52,250
Minegishi!

1109
01:01:55,280 --> 01:01:56,650
Thank you very much

1110
01:01:57,180 --> 01:01:59,190
Eh? How come?

1111
01:02:01,060 --> 01:02:03,090
I'm so happy, thank you everyone

1112
01:02:07,190 --> 01:02:09,700
Well, this is just...

1113
01:02:09,700 --> 01:02:13,630
The last scene of offense and defense between you and Asahi was just amazing

1114
01:02:13,630 --> 01:02:15,570
It really worths watching

1115
01:02:15,570 --> 01:02:19,710
But if you think twice, Asahi could actually be laughing under the mask

1116
01:02:20,070 --> 01:02:23,980
But this contest was so amazing, that I would really like to watch another season

1117
01:02:23,980 --> 01:02:27,550
Thank you everyone for all your hard work

1118
01:02:27,550 --> 01:02:28,820
They are all amazing

1119
01:02:28,820 --> 01:02:30,820
It was really interesting
