00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,450
Well, let's hear today's first request.

3
00:00:02,680 --> 00:00:03,450
Okay.

4
00:00:03,450 --> 00:00:09,820
Our first request is from Kashiwagi Mone-san,
a 21 year old part-time worker from Osaka prefecture.

5
00:00:09,820 --> 00:00:13,330
"To Director Nishida and all the detectives, I always enjoy watching."

6
00:00:13,330 --> 00:00:13,860
Alright.

7
00:00:13,860 --> 00:00:17,060
"Actually, I have a problem that I don't really talk to people about."

8
00:00:17,060 --> 00:00:19,230
"That is my mom's love is too intense."

9
00:00:19,230 --> 00:00:21,870
"In any case, her physical affection is incredible."

10
00:00:21,870 --> 00:00:25,770
"When I come home, she immediately
embraces me and insists on clinging to me."

11
00:00:25,770 --> 00:00:27,910
"Every day, she kisses my cheek over and over."

12
00:00:27,910 --> 00:00:30,940
"When I ask her for a favor, she makes me kiss her on the lips."

13
00:00:30,940 --> 00:00:34,910
"At night, we sleep together in a single size bed. It's cramped."

14
00:00:34,910 --> 00:00:35,480
Cramped, huh.

15
00:00:35,480 --> 00:00:37,980
"No matter how many times I ask her to stop, she won't listen."

16
00:00:37,980 --> 00:00:42,490
"I'm already 21 years old. How freaking long are these days going to continue?"

17
00:00:42,490 --> 00:00:44,760
"In order to put an end to this intense physical affection,

18
00:00:44,760 --> 00:00:48,060
can you persuade my mom to stop?" That's the request.

19
00:00:46,330 --> 00:00:48,060
Oh~

20
00:00:48,060 --> 00:00:50,100
The mom can't help but be that doting, huh.

21
00:00:50,100 --> 00:00:52,000
Well, that's how it seems.

22
00:00:52,000 --> 00:00:54,070
The client's mother is a single mother and

23
00:00:54,070 --> 00:00:57,470
when the client was in nursery school, she helped out there for example.

24
00:00:56,600 --> 00:00:57,470
Is that so?

25
00:00:57,470 --> 00:00:59,570
She seriously and carefully raised her and

26
00:00:59,570 --> 00:01:02,510
it seems her love for her is exceedingly intense.

27
00:01:02,510 --> 00:01:05,810
This physical affection she does every day has crossed some boundaries.

28
00:01:05,810 --> 00:01:08,350
What kind of physical affection is this?

29
00:01:08,350 --> 00:01:10,480
What was this mother's love like?

30
00:01:10,480 --> 00:01:12,790
Please take a look.

31
00:01:13,250 --> 00:01:16,820
You're 21? And still?

32
00:01:16,160 --> 00:01:16,820
She still does.

33
00:01:16,820 --> 00:01:19,690
She showers you with physical affection every day?

34
00:01:18,690 --> 00:01:19,690
Every day.

35
00:01:19,690 --> 00:01:22,160
Your mom goes a little too far with your body and

36
00:01:22,160 --> 00:01:25,000
it's become sort of irritating and you dislike?

37
00:01:25,000 --> 00:01:27,170
I love my mom but...

38
00:01:27,170 --> 00:01:28,470
You like her, right?

39
00:01:28,470 --> 00:01:31,100
I'm loved but,

40
00:01:31,100 --> 00:01:33,210
it's a little bit too much.

41
00:01:33,210 --> 00:01:37,540
When you're at home, what percentage of the time is she doing it?

42
00:01:37,540 --> 00:01:39,850
Always.

43
00:01:44,320 --> 00:01:45,280
Seriously?

44
00:01:45,280 --> 00:01:47,990
Where's your mom today?

45
00:01:47,990 --> 00:01:50,060
She's at my grandma's place right now.

46
00:01:50,060 --> 00:01:53,630
Well, the mother who is out will be home soon, so

47
00:01:53,630 --> 00:01:57,230
we'll watch from the other room.

48
00:01:59,300 --> 00:02:02,200
I'm home~

49
00:02:00,670 --> 00:02:02,200
She's come home.

50
00:02:03,740 --> 00:02:05,770
I'm home.

51
00:02:04,140 --> 00:02:05,770
Welcome back.

52
00:02:05,770 --> 00:02:10,010
You here, Mone? You didn't go out?

53
00:02:07,210 --> 00:02:10,010
Yeah.

54
00:02:10,280 --> 00:02:12,140
I'm home.

55
00:02:12,140 --> 00:02:13,950
I'm home.

56
00:02:13,110 --> 00:02:13,950
Welcome back.

57
00:02:13,950 --> 00:02:17,150
A welcome home kiss. Mwah~

58
00:02:17,920 --> 00:02:19,490
No way... eh?

59
00:02:19,490 --> 00:02:21,890
Were you lonely?

60
00:02:20,890 --> 00:02:21,890
No.

61
00:02:21,890 --> 00:02:24,460
Were you a little lonely?

62
00:02:23,520 --> 00:02:24,460
I'm not lonely.

63
00:02:24,460 --> 00:02:26,990
Not a little bit?

64
00:02:25,760 --> 00:02:26,990
No.

65
00:02:26,990 --> 00:02:28,760
You really were lonely, Mone-chan.

66
00:02:28,760 --> 00:02:30,030
I'm not lonely.

67
00:02:30,030 --> 00:02:31,160
Wait, one more hug....

68
00:02:31,160 --> 00:02:34,530
Enough already. You just did.

69
00:02:32,670 --> 00:02:34,530
You didn't hug me!

70
00:02:34,530 --> 00:02:37,900
Here we go, okay, hug. Even harder!

71
00:02:37,900 --> 00:02:40,140
Hug! Okay.

72
00:02:40,540 --> 00:02:42,140
Eh?

73
00:02:42,140 --> 00:02:44,310
What are you doing?

74
00:02:44,310 --> 00:02:46,380
I'm not doing anything.

75
00:02:46,380 --> 00:02:49,450
She's really looking.

76
00:02:49,450 --> 00:02:50,750
Leave me alone for once.

77
00:02:50,750 --> 00:02:52,150
Okay then, if you give me a kiss.

78
00:02:52,150 --> 00:02:54,620
Quit it already.

79
00:02:52,850 --> 00:02:54,620
If you give me a kiss, I'll leave you alone.

80
00:02:54,020 --> 00:02:54,620
No!

81
00:02:59,790 --> 00:03:03,230
That's really irritating.

82
00:03:03,230 --> 00:03:05,600
Hurry up, hurry up, hurry up.

83
00:03:05,600 --> 00:03:07,230
Mwah~

84
00:03:07,230 --> 00:03:08,670
Seriously?

85
00:03:09,800 --> 00:03:11,270
What are you doing?

86
00:03:11,270 --> 00:03:14,740
Hahahaha... you surprised me.

87
00:03:14,740 --> 00:03:15,680
Are you kidding?

88
00:03:15,680 --> 00:03:17,610
It's this, Mone-chan?

89
00:03:16,980 --> 00:03:17,610
This is it.

90
00:03:17,610 --> 00:03:20,310
This, seriously?

91
00:03:19,280 --> 00:03:20,310
What is it?

92
00:03:20,310 --> 00:03:23,450
It's always like this while you're at home?

93
00:03:22,210 --> 00:03:23,450
It's always like this.

94
00:03:23,450 --> 00:03:26,090
That's hell!

95
00:03:24,880 --> 00:03:26,090
Why?

96
00:03:26,090 --> 00:03:27,290
When you come home,

97
00:03:27,290 --> 00:03:31,390
You immediately start searching for your daughter.

98
00:03:29,320 --> 00:03:31,390
Yeah, because she's here.

99
00:03:31,390 --> 00:03:34,160
When my daughter comes home, I always do it.

100
00:03:34,160 --> 00:03:36,160
That time is different, somewhat?

101
00:03:35,530 --> 00:03:36,160
A little.

102
00:03:36,160 --> 00:03:39,830
Woah~ I kind of want to see that a little.

103
00:03:39,830 --> 00:03:41,600
Can you do that? Can we see that?

104
00:03:43,270 --> 00:03:45,810
I'm home~

105
00:03:44,440 --> 00:03:45,810
Welcome home~!

106
00:03:45,810 --> 00:03:49,480
Mone-chan, welcome home~! Welcome home~!

107
00:03:51,240 --> 00:03:52,140
No way...

108
00:03:52,480 --> 00:03:54,950
It's like this every day?

109
00:03:53,480 --> 00:03:54,950
Every day.

110
00:03:54,950 --> 00:03:59,490
If Mone goes to sleep before me,

111
00:03:57,050 --> 00:03:59,490
So, Mone is asleep here.

112
00:04:00,620 --> 00:04:05,990
Mone-chan, are you asleep? Mwah~ Good night. Mwah~

113
00:04:05,990 --> 00:04:11,000
...I'd do. I'd put my arm around her like this.

114
00:04:13,300 --> 00:04:16,970
There's one more thing I'm curious about, when you ask for something,

115
00:04:16,970 --> 00:04:19,040
The having to kiss her on the lips, that you don't like.

116
00:04:18,400 --> 00:04:19,040
Yeah.

117
00:04:19,040 --> 00:04:22,310
I want you to show me everything.

118
00:04:22,310 --> 00:04:24,510
Try asking for something.

119
00:04:24,510 --> 00:04:28,410
Make dinner?

120
00:04:26,210 --> 00:04:28,410
Eh~ that's a bother.

121
00:04:28,410 --> 00:04:32,120
Please.

122
00:04:29,320 --> 00:04:32,120
Eh~? What should I do~?

123
00:04:33,190 --> 00:04:37,060
What is that mouth?

124
00:04:37,060 --> 00:04:38,320
Alright, I'll make it for you.

125
00:04:38,660 --> 00:04:40,730
You did that one to yourself.

126
00:04:40,730 --> 00:04:43,660
If I don't do this, she keeps pursing her lips and

127
00:04:43,660 --> 00:04:45,100
won't listen to me.

128
00:04:45,330 --> 00:04:48,730
Want to try eating a little from Mama?

129
00:04:47,030 --> 00:04:48,730
Okay~

130
00:04:49,840 --> 00:04:53,370
Is it tasty?

131
00:04:50,600 --> 00:04:53,370
She doesn't let up even while they're eating.

132
00:04:54,110 --> 00:04:57,180
Still, she's 21 right?

133
00:04:57,180 --> 00:05:00,650
So, it's alright until about 30 I guess.

134
00:05:00,650 --> 00:05:04,450
So long! Until her thirties?

135
00:05:04,450 --> 00:05:07,950
Well, I understand Mone-chan's hardships.

136
00:05:07,950 --> 00:05:09,890
You understand?

137
00:05:08,650 --> 00:05:09,890
I understand.

138
00:05:09,890 --> 00:05:13,330
Wait mom, let's talk as adults.

139
00:05:13,330 --> 00:05:18,560
How did this intense physical affection
get started in the first place?

140
00:05:18,560 --> 00:05:22,030
She's my darling, my beloved

141
00:05:22,030 --> 00:05:24,040
It's irresistible?

142
00:05:23,200 --> 00:05:24,040
Yeah, irresistible.

143
00:05:24,040 --> 00:05:26,310
Inside me, I will always

144
00:05:26,310 --> 00:05:30,180
feel like she's my baby.

145
00:05:30,180 --> 00:05:32,550
So the case is, since she was a baby,

146
00:05:32,550 --> 00:05:35,780
you've always done it?

147
00:05:34,710 --> 00:05:35,780
That's right.

148
00:05:35,780 --> 00:05:39,420
When my daughter was 19,
she said she wanted to live on her own.

149
00:05:39,420 --> 00:05:44,020
She went out and did that.
And after 1 year, she came back.

150
00:05:44,020 --> 00:05:46,730
After that, it became sort of more extreme.

151
00:05:46,730 --> 00:05:48,230
It poured out?

152
00:05:47,690 --> 00:05:48,230
Yeah.

153
00:05:48,660 --> 00:05:51,400
What did you do during that time?

154
00:05:51,400 --> 00:05:54,330
At first, I just cried.

155
00:05:55,170 --> 00:05:57,100
And then, I bought this child.

156
00:05:57,100 --> 00:05:59,310
I got this child.

157
00:05:59,310 --> 00:06:02,640
Since you couldn't be affectionate with her, to distract yourself

158
00:06:02,640 --> 00:06:03,980
you bought this child?

159
00:06:03,540 --> 00:06:03,980
Yeah.

160
00:06:03,980 --> 00:06:08,250
When Mone wasn't here, I slept with this child.

161
00:06:09,110 --> 00:06:12,720
This is really serious, huh. You really like her, huh?

162
00:06:12,720 --> 00:06:14,890
Yeah.

163
00:06:13,150 --> 00:06:14,890
Isn't that right, mom?

164
00:06:17,620 --> 00:06:20,090
I just spoke with your mother.

165
00:06:20,230 --> 00:06:23,430
She's cute and my darling. She's cute, so it can't be helped.

166
00:06:23,430 --> 00:06:25,530
You understand parents, right?

167
00:06:25,530 --> 00:06:28,370
However, there are limits, right?

168
00:06:27,870 --> 00:06:28,370
Yes.

169
00:06:28,370 --> 00:06:31,040
It's draining.

170
00:06:32,240 --> 00:06:37,910
Well, after all Mone-chan, this... hmm.

171
00:06:37,910 --> 00:06:40,680
Let's say your heart is decided.

172
00:06:40,680 --> 00:06:43,680
Earnestly telling her.

173
00:06:43,680 --> 00:06:46,520
Now, about what you really think,

174
00:06:46,520 --> 00:06:50,790
let's seriously and thoroughly discuss it.

175
00:06:50,790 --> 00:06:53,960
Well then, if you would.

176
00:06:51,820 --> 00:06:53,960
Alright.

177
00:06:53,960 --> 00:06:59,600
Let's see, I'm already 21 and I'm not a child anymore.

178
00:06:59,600 --> 00:07:03,500
Yeah...

179
00:07:01,070 --> 00:07:03,500
After a few words from the daughter!?

180
00:07:06,210 --> 00:07:07,940
Aren't you a little quick to cry?

181
00:07:09,340 --> 00:07:11,340
The daughter too...

182
00:07:12,440 --> 00:07:14,110
She only said a few words.

183
00:07:14,110 --> 00:07:17,750
She only said "I'm 21 and not a child anymore."

184
00:07:15,920 --> 00:07:17,750
She said "I'm not a child anymore."

185
00:07:17,750 --> 00:07:19,290
She's not a child.

186
00:07:19,790 --> 00:07:22,050
I thought she was a child...

187
00:07:22,050 --> 00:07:26,560
She's 21. She's had her coming-of-age ceremony. Let's continue.

188
00:07:26,560 --> 00:07:31,130
Someday, I'm going to get married and

189
00:07:31,130 --> 00:07:34,470
when I move out on my own,

190
00:07:34,470 --> 00:07:36,370
I have my worries.

191
00:07:38,500 --> 00:07:40,910
Will you be lonely?

192
00:07:43,680 --> 00:07:47,210
You're worried about your mother, right?
When you're suddenly not here anymore.

193
00:07:47,210 --> 00:07:49,650
If she gets married, she won't be here anymore.

194
00:07:49,650 --> 00:07:51,150
What do you intend to do then?

195
00:07:51,150 --> 00:07:52,150
Well...

196
00:07:52,150 --> 00:07:54,690
If she marries a rich person,

197
00:07:54,690 --> 00:07:59,220
we can establish a two-generation household and we can live (together) but...

198
00:07:59,220 --> 00:08:03,700
if it's a poor person, it can't be helped and we can't stay together.

199
00:08:03,700 --> 00:08:07,470
There's a strange pressure hang above, huh.

200
00:08:07,470 --> 00:08:09,900
There's a strange pressure

201
00:08:09,900 --> 00:08:12,200
By the way, do you have a boyfriend now?

202
00:08:11,670 --> 00:08:12,200
Yes.

203
00:08:12,200 --> 00:08:14,610
Do you know that boyfriend?

204
00:08:14,640 --> 00:08:16,840
The last guy was better...

205
00:08:16,840 --> 00:08:18,610
What kind of comment is that?

206
00:08:18,780 --> 00:08:21,110
Reply to her. This is no time to be laughing.

207
00:08:21,110 --> 00:08:22,850
The current guy is better.

208
00:08:22,850 --> 00:08:25,120
Say why he's good.

209
00:08:26,450 --> 00:08:30,690
He's got money...

210
00:08:27,590 --> 00:08:30,690
Money she says...

211
00:08:31,260 --> 00:08:34,530
No, that's not right.

212
00:08:34,530 --> 00:08:36,160
What's not right?

213
00:08:36,160 --> 00:08:39,000
Mom, why did you want to do this until now?

214
00:08:39,000 --> 00:08:40,830
Can you convey that?

215
00:08:40,830 --> 00:08:45,840
I had the terrible thought, that Mone suddenly wouldn't be here, so

216
00:08:45,840 --> 00:08:50,110
I clung all over Mone.

217
00:08:53,280 --> 00:08:55,680
Now,

218
00:08:55,680 --> 00:08:57,020
I'm no longer a child so,

219
00:08:57,020 --> 00:08:59,080
I want to be alone...

220
00:09:00,190 --> 00:09:02,150
It's no good if you use those words.

221
00:09:02,150 --> 00:09:04,660
She's bursting into tears because you said "I'm no longer a child."

222
00:09:04,660 --> 00:09:06,390
She heard that and started crying again.

223
00:09:06,390 --> 00:09:09,230
You want to be treated like an adult, right?

224
00:09:08,590 --> 00:09:09,230
Yes.

225
00:09:09,230 --> 00:09:10,030
Why's that?

226
00:09:10,360 --> 00:09:12,400
Because I'm not a child.

227
00:09:15,370 --> 00:09:18,200
Why are you crying like that?

228
00:09:18,200 --> 00:09:26,650
That's why with things like the clinging and the kissing,

229
00:09:26,650 --> 00:09:27,980
I want you to stop.

230
00:09:29,950 --> 00:09:32,250
I understand.

231
00:09:34,820 --> 00:09:37,860
Well, um, Mom,

232
00:09:37,860 --> 00:09:42,760
if you suddenly have to stop now, you maybe become lonely and

233
00:09:42,760 --> 00:09:45,400
your reaction to that may make it even more intense...

234
00:09:45,400 --> 00:09:50,500
This physical affection isn't allowed!

235
00:09:50,500 --> 00:09:55,640
Because of that, today is the last day of intense physical affection.

236
00:09:55,640 --> 00:09:58,680
Mone-chan won't refuse anything.

237
00:09:58,680 --> 00:10:00,750
You can do that, right?

238
00:10:00,750 --> 00:10:04,520
If you won't do anything from tomorrow on, I can endure it today.

239
00:10:04,520 --> 00:10:07,990
How long do you have to do it to be satisfied?

240
00:10:09,250 --> 00:10:13,160
1 hour.

241
00:10:10,260 --> 00:10:13,160
1 hour.

242
00:10:13,160 --> 00:10:15,690
So long...

243
00:10:15,690 --> 00:10:19,200
The last physical affection of their lives.

244
00:10:19,200 --> 00:10:21,670
Ready, start!

245
00:10:24,900 --> 00:10:27,570
She's giving her a tight embrace.

246
00:10:29,040 --> 00:10:30,710
Once this 1 hour is up,

247
00:10:30,710 --> 00:10:34,410
she can't do this kind of intense physical affection ever again.

248
00:10:34,410 --> 00:10:37,880
Cute, cute.

249
00:10:37,880 --> 00:10:40,990
Cute. Mwah~

250
00:10:43,160 --> 00:10:46,630
Endure it, endure it. Hang in there, Mone-chan.

251
00:10:46,630 --> 00:10:49,260
If you can endure 1 hour, you won't have to ever again.

252
00:10:49,260 --> 00:10:51,360
I want it to hurry up and be over.

253
00:10:52,460 --> 00:10:55,130
Like that time...

254
00:10:57,200 --> 00:10:58,400
What are you wanting to do?

255
00:10:58,400 --> 00:11:00,140
When she was a baby, I'd do this.

256
00:11:00,140 --> 00:11:02,940
Ah, when you would rock her.

257
00:11:03,510 --> 00:11:07,410
30 minutes have elapsed. There are 30 minutes left.

258
00:11:07,410 --> 00:11:09,210
There's things I haven't done yet.

259
00:11:10,880 --> 00:11:13,790
Do this and I'll feed you.

260
00:11:13,790 --> 00:11:15,620
The last "Aah~"

261
00:11:15,620 --> 00:11:18,320
What are you happy about?

262
00:11:20,130 --> 00:11:22,960
The last co-sleeping.

263
00:11:25,560 --> 00:11:28,130
There's 15 minutes left.

264
00:11:28,130 --> 00:11:30,940
It's become intense.

265
00:11:30,940 --> 00:11:36,010
Last is, where she always overdoes it, on this sofa.

266
00:11:36,010 --> 00:11:38,410
3 minutes remaining.

267
00:11:41,180 --> 00:11:43,520
This isn't physical affection anymore,

268
00:11:43,520 --> 00:11:45,550
she's got her in a Nelson hold now.

269
00:11:50,420 --> 00:11:54,330
Her last time to experience this with her daughter, Mone.

270
00:11:54,330 --> 00:11:55,360
1 minute remaining.

271
00:11:58,160 --> 00:12:02,130
She's kissing her. On the mouth.

272
00:12:02,130 --> 00:12:05,070
A kiss storm. A kissing storm.

273
00:12:05,070 --> 00:12:07,340
She's now kissing her right on the mouth.

274
00:12:07,640 --> 00:12:10,340
You can't fight back, Mone-chan. Endure this last part.

275
00:12:10,340 --> 00:12:15,050
10 seconds left, 9, 8, 7, 6,

276
00:12:15,050 --> 00:12:19,820
5, 4, 3, 2, 1.

277
00:12:19,820 --> 00:12:24,390
That's it!

278
00:12:26,460 --> 00:12:31,100
Well, mom, you're crying but those tears are?

279
00:12:31,600 --> 00:12:33,530
It's like,

280
00:12:33,530 --> 00:12:36,970
she's climbed the stairs of adulthood I think.

281
00:12:36,970 --> 00:12:40,440
Well, no more physical affection.

282
00:12:40,440 --> 00:12:43,880
Can you do that?

283
00:12:41,470 --> 00:12:43,880
Yes, I can do that.

284
00:12:43,880 --> 00:12:46,610
I'm not a child anymore, okay?

285
00:12:49,350 --> 00:12:54,290
Why? Those words were so gentle.

286
00:12:57,360 --> 00:12:59,260
Oh~ intense, huh.

287
00:12:59,260 --> 00:13:01,590
A mother's love.

288
00:13:01,590 --> 00:13:04,500
So, the mother has now,

289
00:13:04,500 --> 00:13:08,770
since then, she's not done any intense physical affection.

290
00:13:07,830 --> 00:13:08,770
Oh, good.

291
00:13:08,770 --> 00:13:11,800
Not being able to do any physical affection is a little pitiful, so

292
00:13:11,800 --> 00:13:13,440
when Mone-chan gets home,

293
00:13:13,440 --> 00:13:16,940
there's nothing intense, but a normal hug.

294
00:13:16,940 --> 00:13:21,080
For only 5 seconds. That's what they decided.

295
00:13:21,080 --> 00:13:22,480
Just 5 seconds.

296
00:13:22,480 --> 00:13:24,020
But the mother, for those 5 seconds,

297
00:13:24,020 --> 00:13:26,750
she counts really, really slowly.

298
00:13:27,320 --> 00:13:31,490
"5~~" she'd say.

299
00:13:31,490 --> 00:13:35,430
The mom has got the best child.
