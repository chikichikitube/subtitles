00:00:01,060 --> 00:00:03,900
-It all started from this day

3
00:00:04,300 --> 00:00:06,850
Hamada, listen,
I bet all the staff have mumbled while sleeping

4
00:00:06,860 --> 00:00:08,900
they wished you were dead
at least once

5
00:00:08,900 --> 00:00:13,000
Get hit and you are IT !!

00:00:20,410 --> 00:00:23,350
Let's see who the chosen ones are

8
00:00:32,800 --> 00:00:37,100

00:00:43,500 --> 00:00:48,250
Yamasaki is the second one

10
00:00:44,810 --> 00:00:47,900
This is his fourth consecutive year

11
00:00:47,930 --> 00:00:49,500
And the last one is...

12
00:00:56,600 --> 00:01:00,490
Hamada, Yamasaki, and Endo will participate in this year's Batsu Game

13
00:01:01,050 --> 00:01:03,990
And this year, it takes place at a...

14
00:01:04,690 --> 00:01:08,000

00:02:18,400 --> 00:02:19,400
I'll say it really quick

27
00:02:19,420 --> 00:02:22,890
Let me just say a couple of things

28
00:02:23,000 --> 00:02:24,580
First thing first

29
00:02:24,830 --> 00:02:26,590
You're freakin' tall, aren't you ?

30
00:02:27,400 --> 00:02:28,860
You JUST noticed that ??

31
00:02:29,200 --> 00:02:30,300
After all these years...

32
00:02:30,350 --> 00:02:31,390
I thought I'd get that out of the way

33
00:02:32,100 --> 00:02:35,930
I also have to say
that I appreciate all the applauses here

34
00:02:35,990 --> 00:02:38,610
but please don't be pointing fingers at me as you laugh hysterically

35
00:02:38,830 --> 00:02:41,530
Yeah, you in front, stop doing that

36
00:02:41,990 --> 00:02:45,730

The day of  the Batsu Game

49
00:03:14,300 --> 00:03:19,070
A bus carrying the three losers arrives at the station

50
00:03:19,290 --> 00:03:20,410
Hey

51
00:03:23,260 --> 00:03:24,400
Hey

52
00:03:25,150 --> 00:03:25,920
Hey

53
00:03:26,590 --> 00:03:27,550
Hey

54
00:03:28,840 --> 00:03:29,470
Hey

55
00:03:29,990 --> 00:03:31,180
Enough with that already !!

56
00:03:31,620 --> 00:03:33,110
Good morning, guys

57
00:03:34,690 --> 00:03:37,090
This guy used to be my manager

58
00:03:35,130 --> 00:03:39,000
Former Downtown Manager
Hiroshi Fujiwara

59
00:03:39,400 --> 00:03:42,200
How else can I greet you ?

60
00:03:45,450 --> 00:03:47,000
We noticed your dialect

61
00:03:47,690 --> 00:03:53,110
By the way
Do you know who I'm supposed to be ?

62
00:03:54,360 --> 00:03:56,650
You look like "Sukeban Detective"

63
00:03:57,270 --> 00:03:58,040
I see

64
00:03:58,450 --> 00:04:01,600
Endo, why don't you smack me on the head ?

65
00:04:07,590 --> 00:04:09,030
As fate would have it, this is who I am

66
00:04:09,500 --> 00:04:11,190
The Fifth Sukeban Detective

67
00:04:11,680 --> 00:04:13,300
Saki Fujiwara

68
00:04:14,500 --> 00:04:17,360
I'm not letting you get away

69
00:04:21,740 --> 00:04:23,700
That's enough of my introduction

70
00:04:24,820 --> 00:04:26,140
Why don't you follow me ?

71
00:04:28,380 --> 00:04:29,590
Take a look over here

72
00:04:30,680 --> 00:04:34,490
Here's today's stage,
"Shakure Police Department"

73
00:04:35,610 --> 00:04:44,600
They will fight against the enemy, trying to make them laugh,
for the next 24 hours

74
00:04:45,450 --> 00:04:46,140
With that said

75
00:04:46,750 --> 00:04:48,520
Why don't you go get

76
00:04:49,020 --> 00:04:53,540
go get, um, um, changed in there

77
00:04:54,060 --> 00:04:55,670
What's with "um, um" ??

78
00:04:55,710 --> 00:04:56,620
Let me just say

79
00:04:57,070 --> 00:05:00,130
that I'm expecting you to be more professional once this starts

80
00:05:00,560 --> 00:05:03,180
Go ahead and put those uniforms on

81
00:05:03,700 --> 00:05:09,170
Changing into the Police Uniforms

82
00:05:09,670 --> 00:05:13,220
But are they typical police uniforms ?

83
00:05:13,420 --> 00:05:15,730
Let's see officer Endo first

84
00:05:21,620 --> 00:05:24,470
Endo - Courageous Officer

85
00:05:24,880 --> 00:05:25,830
Yamasaki

86
00:05:28,620 --> 00:05:31,290
Yamasaki -Not a "Wuss" anymore

87
00:05:36,330 --> 00:05:41,640
Hamada's uniform is second hand

88
00:05:41,900 --> 00:05:43,330
Hamada san, that's no good

89
00:05:44,300 --> 00:05:46,560
What is that on your left knee

90
00:05:47,790 --> 00:05:49,200
This isn't cool

91
00:05:50,500 --> 00:05:52,300
Not fair at all !

92
00:05:52,470 --> 00:05:54,650
This is cheating !!

93
00:05:56,400 --> 00:05:57,220
What the hell is this ??

94
00:06:00,000 --> 00:06:01,300
You're playing dirty

95
00:06:01,330 --> 00:06:03,500
Very dirty

96
00:06:02,000 --> 00:06:04,560
The production team is using subtle humors to get you guys

97
00:06:06,000 --> 00:06:07,830
I don't see how I'm playing dirty

98
00:06:07,980 --> 00:06:09,070
I wanna look sharp, too, like you guys

99
00:06:09,530 --> 00:06:10,720
I'd love to get changed later

100
00:06:11,350 --> 00:06:12,900
It suits you though, if I may say so

101
00:06:15,000 --> 00:06:17,160
Let me explain how the game goes

102
00:06:18,880 --> 00:06:24,440
Rule:
Work for 24 hours as policeman

103
00:06:27,380 --> 00:06:33,910
Rule:
After crossing the gate,
you are not to laugh

104
00:06:35,600 --> 00:06:40,360
Rule:
If caught laughing,
a severe punishment is delivered

105
00:06:41,100 --> 00:06:41,940
Wait a sec

106
00:06:42,490 --> 00:06:43,860
Give us a second

107
00:06:48,400 --> 00:06:50,130
Once you cross here,
the game starts

108
00:06:51,010 --> 00:06:52,710
Alright !!
-Let's do this !!

109
00:06:53,500 --> 00:06:55,920
There's no turning back !

110
00:06:55,920 --> 00:06:56,730
Here we go !

111
00:06:57,100 --> 00:07:00,830
Do Not Laugh for 24 Hours: The Police Series

112
00:06:58,170 --> 00:06:59,200
Wait a minute

113
00:07:00,690 --> 00:07:03,530
Don't forget to introduce yourselves
to your senior officers

114
00:07:06,550 --> 00:07:08,540
An honor to meet you all

115
00:07:10,240 --> 00:07:11,240
Look!

116
00:07:12,190 --> 00:07:14,300
Here's our reputable motorcycle team

117
00:07:19,050 --> 00:07:25,450
Motorcycle Police on Duty !!

118
00:07:25,480 --> 00:07:26,330
Pretty cool

119
00:07:29,000 --> 00:07:31,220
Captain
Obachan
(middle aged woman)

120
00:07:31,630 --> 00:07:34,500
Motorcycle Captain

121
00:07:37,990 --> 00:07:39,930
That was a swift first strike

122
00:07:41,920 --> 00:07:45,000
Here comes an American police man !!

123
00:07:41,950 --> 00:07:43,260
You serious ?

124
00:07:43,740 --> 00:07:44,600
Are you serious ?

125
00:07:45,380 --> 00:07:46,670
Are you serious ??

126
00:07:48,960 --> 00:07:50,470
That looked painful

127
00:07:50,930 --> 00:07:58,450
If caught laughing,
you get butt-slapped by American police men

128
00:07:57,170 --> 00:07:58,700
This is how it's going to be ?

129
00:08:07,650 --> 00:08:09,690
Don't be making that face !!

130
00:08:11,020 --> 00:08:12,090
Damn you

131
00:08:18,220 --> 00:08:20,190
This really really hurts

132
00:08:25,740 --> 00:08:27,940
Don't you make that face at me !!

133
00:08:28,330 --> 00:08:29,300
I'm not making a face

134
00:08:30,040 --> 00:08:31,170
Endo, you were laughing, too

135
00:08:31,560 --> 00:08:32,970
No, I don't think so

136
00:08:34,820 --> 00:08:36,220
This is going to be a tough day

137
00:08:38,640 --> 00:08:40,530
We don't need to be looking at things like these

138
00:08:41,670 --> 00:08:44,650
Here's this months' slogan

139
00:08:44,700 --> 00:08:46,100
Let me recite it for you guys

140
00:08:46,250 --> 00:08:47,600
Just repeat after me

141
00:08:48,770 --> 00:08:50,480
Look before you cross

142
00:08:50,930 --> 00:08:52,080
with your big chin

143
00:08:55,200 --> 00:08:57,160
Look before you cross

144
00:08:57,600 --> 00:08:58,950
with your big chin

145
00:08:59,700 --> 00:09:01,290
Don't fall for the words of crooks

146
00:09:01,820 --> 00:09:03,040
with their double chin

147
00:09:03,500 --> 00:09:05,930
Don't fall for the words of crooks

148
00:09:05,930 --> 00:09:08,380
with their double chin

149
00:09:08,580 --> 00:09:09,960
Let's go

150
00:09:10,190 --> 00:09:11,900
Yamasaki, no more funny faces

151
00:09:13,330 --> 00:09:14,870
Let's try to get along

152
00:09:14,630 --> 00:09:16,570
I didn't do anything wrong

153
00:09:16,940 --> 00:09:18,870
I just ask you not to make that face again

154
00:09:19,440 --> 00:09:21,000
I'm not making any faces

155
00:09:21,300 --> 00:09:24,500
Change in Endo's demeanor

156
00:09:27,720 --> 00:09:29,150
I don't remember why I laughed there

157
00:09:30,510 --> 00:09:33,850
Most-Wanted Criminal Cut-Out Boards
(Gah-Soo)

158
00:09:38,230 --> 00:09:44,490
I was trying to figure out what that was,
and now I know

159
00:09:46,340 --> 00:09:46,950
Take a look

160
00:09:47,410 --> 00:09:49,920
He's one of the most notorious
criminals in the city

161
00:09:50,770 --> 00:09:51,660
His name is Kenji Suga

162
00:09:52,200 --> 00:09:54,550
Round faced, Overweight, and a Dark Complexion

163
00:09:54,650 --> 00:09:56,290
His face is kinda oily, too

164
00:09:56,500 --> 00:09:59,000
That's life-size by the way

165
00:10:01,640 --> 00:10:06,000
Endo Tries not to Look

166
00:10:06,480 --> 00:10:08,160
Here we commemorate our past chiefs

167
00:10:09,420 --> 00:10:12,700
Original Chief
Mr. Suzuki

168
00:10:12,840 --> 00:10:13,690
2nd Chief
Mr. Hashimoto

169
00:10:14,790 --> 00:10:15,880
3rd Chief
Mr. Okamoto

170
00:10:16,820 --> 00:10:17,840
4th Chief
Mr. Kimura

171
00:10:18,680 --> 00:10:22,230
5th Chief
Lopez

172
00:10:25,370 --> 00:10:27,730
That was a tough call

173
00:10:37,490 --> 00:10:43,600
Hamada Tries to Make the Others Laugh

174
00:10:37,600 --> 00:10:41,000
It's so obvious he's trying to make us laugh

175
00:10:45,600 --> 00:10:47,300
You guys needed to stick together, seriously

176
00:10:47,980 --> 00:10:48,620
Here's our receptionist

177
00:10:49,640 --> 00:10:52,240
She knows everything about this station

178
00:10:52,440 --> 00:10:57,500
Receptionist:
Reiko

179
00:10:54,170 --> 00:10:55,310
Nice to meet you all

180
00:10:58,470 --> 00:11:02,200
Let me tell you a little about this police station

181
00:11:03,150 --> 00:11:03,600
Gulp

182
00:11:07,430 --> 00:11:08,300
This station was built in 1967

183
00:11:09,130 --> 00:11:09,620
Gulp

184
00:11:10,090 --> 00:11:10,830
Gulp

185
00:11:14,170 --> 00:11:16,000
She would have got to me for sure

186
00:11:16,050 --> 00:11:18,440
We couldn't keep our straight faces

187
00:11:22,440 --> 00:11:23,680
She drinks so much

188
00:11:28,710 --> 00:11:29,230
Gulp

189
00:11:31,030 --> 00:11:33,200
I'm not done yet

190
00:11:33,510 --> 00:11:34,400
Where were we ?

191
00:11:36,400 --> 00:11:37,770
So we've been protecting

192
00:11:38,360 --> 00:11:40,100
citizens for the past 39 years

193
00:11:42,150 --> 00:11:42,610
Gulp

194
00:11:43,000 --> 00:11:46,320
There used to be 213 officers here

195
00:11:48,880 --> 00:11:49,320
Gulp

196
00:11:49,570 --> 00:11:50,240
Gulp

197
00:11:50,240 --> 00:11:51,390
Gulp, gulp

198
00:11:56,720 --> 00:11:58,180
She held us there for a while

199
00:12:02,530 --> 00:12:03,530
Will you finish that already ?

200
00:12:07,100 --> 00:12:08,690
Good luck to you all

201
00:12:11,100 --> 00:12:11,950
Gulp

202
00:12:12,800 --> 00:12:15,210
and good luck with the training, too

203
00:12:24,590 --> 00:12:26,660
Here's our Boss's office

204
00:12:30,790 --> 00:12:33,620
Boss, here's your trainees

205
00:12:35,350 --> 00:12:40,050
The Boss
Yutaro

206
00:12:38,870 --> 00:12:39,890
So you've made it

207
00:12:41,080 --> 00:12:43,670
The three new hires

208
00:12:50,030 --> 00:12:52,040
Good luck to you

209
00:12:55,910 --> 00:12:57,340
Don't let me down, huh ?

210
00:13:07,590 --> 00:13:09,930
That "ignoring" routine gets me every time

211
00:13:10,800 --> 00:13:12,590
And where's he looking, anyway ?

212
00:13:20,200 --> 00:13:22,020
What are your "handles" ??

213
00:13:23,310 --> 00:13:24,990
Don't have one yet, I suppose

214
00:13:25,150 --> 00:13:29,020
As policemen,
you need to have a handle or two

215
00:13:29,300 --> 00:13:32,310
Let's take care of that right now

216
00:13:32,600 --> 00:13:35,620
"Gift" from the Boss
He provides Their Handle Names !!

217
00:13:35,390 --> 00:13:36,200
What's your name ?

218
00:13:36,570 --> 00:13:37,570
I'm Hamada

219
00:13:38,200 --> 00:13:39,100
Hamada...

220
00:13:39,910 --> 00:13:42,200
What's your favorite food ?

221
00:13:43,900 --> 00:13:45,590
I like stir fried noodles

222
00:13:45,690 --> 00:13:49,000
Noodles!
They're good, aren't they !?

223
00:13:49,910 --> 00:13:50,900
Alright

224
00:13:53,960 --> 00:13:54,870
I got it

225
00:13:57,250 --> 00:14:01,400
Hamada's Handle
"LIPS"

226
00:14:00,790 --> 00:14:01,650
You, next

227
00:14:02,850 --> 00:14:03,790
What's your name ?

228
00:14:04,340 --> 00:14:05,360
I'm Endo

229
00:14:06,740 --> 00:14:07,490
Are you married ?

230
00:14:08,050 --> 00:14:08,520
Yes

231
00:14:10,560 --> 00:14:11,020
With kids ?

232
00:14:11,710 --> 00:14:12,600
I have a child

233
00:14:12,860 --> 00:14:15,300
How festive !

234
00:14:20,450 --> 00:14:23,100
Endo's Handle
"ENDO"

235
00:14:23,570 --> 00:14:24,320
With that...

236
00:14:25,130 --> 00:14:27,030
Excuse me, Boss but...

237
00:14:28,670 --> 00:14:30,750
I haven't receive my "handle" yet

238
00:14:36,860 --> 00:14:38,960
I couldn't hold myself together there

239
00:14:45,960 --> 00:14:47,730
I see
Sorry about that

240
00:14:48,260 --> 00:14:49,720
Let me have your name then ?

241
00:14:50,140 --> 00:14:51,200
I'm Yamasaki

242
00:14:51,910 --> 00:14:54,070
How many TV shows are you on per week ?

243
00:14:54,730 --> 00:14:57,200
I'm on internet radio

244
00:14:58,600 --> 00:15:00,160
Internet radio...

245
00:15:00,200 --> 00:15:02,400
Respectable occupation

246
00:15:03,260 --> 00:15:04,090
Anything else ?

247
00:15:05,200 --> 00:15:06,600
What else...?

248
00:15:12,600 --> 00:15:14,450
You asked for it

249
00:15:17,290 --> 00:15:20,540
You laughed at the fact
that you have no routine gigs on TV

250
00:15:22,720 --> 00:15:24,810
Mmm...
Not much to work with...

251
00:15:26,630 --> 00:15:27,100
C'mon in

252
00:15:27,950 --> 00:15:29,090
Hi Boss

253
00:15:30,400 --> 00:15:33,200
Detective "Royal Highness"
Akira Onodera

254
00:15:32,820 --> 00:15:34,420
Oh, good timing, "Royal Highness"

255
00:15:35,600 --> 00:15:38,600
Here's our new trainees
They're starting today

256
00:15:40,200 --> 00:15:41,800
I was just giving them their "handles"

257
00:15:42,700 --> 00:15:43,600
To your right is

258
00:15:43,650 --> 00:15:44,990
"LIPS"

259
00:15:45,670 --> 00:15:47,400
To your left is
"ENDO"

260
00:15:48,090 --> 00:15:51,890
And I can't come up with anything
for him in the middle

261
00:15:52,450 --> 00:15:54,340
Maybe you can help me with this

262
00:15:54,890 --> 00:15:55,910
Let me see...

263
00:15:56,860 --> 00:15:58,690
How many TV shows are you on ?

264
00:16:02,000 --> 00:16:03,580
In the Osaka area,

265
00:16:03,900 --> 00:16:05,260
I've got a small gig

266
00:16:05,600 --> 00:16:08,400
And I'm on internet radio in the Tokyo area

267
00:16:09,120 --> 00:16:10,240
I see...

268
00:16:10,350 --> 00:16:12,120
Well, well, well

269
00:16:12,940 --> 00:16:14,410
This is difficult, isn't it ?

270
00:16:16,390 --> 00:16:18,550
How about "D#CKHEAD" ??

271
00:16:20,250 --> 00:16:21,230
"DI#KHEAD"

272
00:16:28,080 --> 00:16:32,200
"Royal Highness" shouldn't have been muttering that word

273
00:16:37,800 --> 00:16:39,180
That sounds good to me

274
00:16:39,600 --> 00:16:41,160
OK, let's go with that then

275
00:16:41,900 --> 00:16:43,650
Yamasaki's Nickname
"D%CKHEAD"

276
00:16:43,800 --> 00:16:44,800
"LIPS"

277
00:16:44,950 --> 00:16:46,000
"ENDO"

278
00:16:46,050 --> 00:16:47,750
"DI%KHEAD"

279
00:16:48,690 --> 00:16:50,940
Protect and serve your community

280
00:16:51,560 --> 00:16:52,500
Good luck to you all

281
00:16:53,190 --> 00:16:54,690
Why don't we go get a drink or two ?

282
00:17:00,760 --> 00:17:02,130
Damn...

283
00:17:04,700 --> 00:17:06,880
I think Hamada should've been slapped then

284
00:17:06,890 --> 00:17:08,160
Should he be saying word like "DI#KHEAD" ??

285
00:17:08,640 --> 00:17:09,670
That caught me off guard

286
00:17:10,100 --> 00:17:10,930
I was shocked

287
00:17:11,900 --> 00:17:13,540
You all got cool handle names for sure

288
00:17:13,550 --> 00:17:14,750
How so ?

289
00:17:14,790 --> 00:17:16,170
Why am I just "ENDO" ??

290
00:17:16,560 --> 00:17:18,290
So what if I'm not on TV so often ?

291
00:17:18,970 --> 00:17:21,260
Hosei san,
will you try not to make us laugh please ?

292
00:17:21,350 --> 00:17:22,710
I'm not !

293
00:17:23,150 --> 00:17:24,350
It was just uncalled for, that's all

294
00:17:26,600 --> 00:17:28,290
What a huge building !

295
00:17:39,600 --> 00:17:49,210

He's responsible for the majority of marriage fraud these days

303
00:18:16,600 --> 00:18:19,200
Endo, take a good look at it
--I got it

304
00:18:19,600 --> 00:18:21,180
Burn this image in your head

305
00:18:26,600 --> 00:18:28,500
Man, that's a good drawing of him

306
00:18:33,030 --> 00:18:35,310

Sexy...um..sexy...

00:19:17,600 --> 00:19:21,220
Fujiwara san,

315
00:19:23,600 --> 00:19:24,670

GOOD LUCK WITH THE BATSU GAME

331
00:20:33,640 --> 00:20:36,570
I don't like these celebrity cameos

332
00:20:46,560 --> 00:20:48,390
Look, she's not even using that keyboard

333
00:20:53,580 --> 00:20:55,470

Let's put on a game face on

338
00:21:08,100 --> 00:21:09,830
Here's your room

Hamada, are you vertically challenged ?

348
00:21:42,950 --> 00:21:44,140
I felt for him there

349
00:21:44,860 --> 00:21:45,800
That wasn't fair

350
00:21:47,460 --> 00:21:48,760
I didn't deserve that chair

351
00:21:50,690 --> 00:21:52,170
That hurt

352
00:22:01,170 --> 00:22:03,390
Hamada, aren't you a bit short ?

353
00:22:04,430 --> 00:22:06,420
Were you always this short ?

354
00:22:09,680 --> 00:22:13,260

Handle it with care

360
00:22:27,380 --> 00:22:28,150
Thank you

361
00:22:28,180 --> 00:22:30,210
Should I put this in my holster ?

362
00:22:29,790 --> 00:22:30,770
Please

363
00:22:32,570 --> 00:22:34,730

You all got....cough, cough !

372
00:23:11,880 --> 00:23:13,770
Excuse me,
So far, so good ?

373
00:23:20,700 --> 00:23:26,090
Item 3: Police Identification Handbook

374
00:23:20,760 --> 00:23:22,190
Don't turn the page just yet

375
00:23:23,260 --> 00:23:24,670
We'll go through it together

376
00:23:25,600 --> 00:23:26,730
Thank you

377
00:23:28,900 --> 00:23:29,800
Thank you

378
00:23:30,750 --> 00:23:33,490
Open up the Police ID Handbook...

379
00:23:34,360 --> 00:23:37,960
and You See Your Photo Inside

380
00:23:38,660 --> 00:23:40,960
Could this Photo be Another Set-up ?!

381
00:23:41,270 --> 00:23:45,160
Hamada: First Year in Show Business

382
00:23:46,010 --> 00:23:49,060
Endo: His Debut at 20 Years Old

383
00:23:49,860 --> 00:23:53,160
Yamasaki: Funny Face

384
00:23:56,500 --> 00:23:58,470
Why don't you open to the first page ?

385
00:23:59,260 --> 00:24:03,370
First year in show business

386
00:24:03,560 --> 00:24:05,730
Debut at 20 years old

387
00:24:05,760 --> 00:24:07,160
Funny Face

388
00:24:18,660 --> 00:24:21,110
Those photos are way too much

389
00:24:24,300 --> 00:24:26,430
Um, we don't have the same ones ?

390
00:24:26,670 --> 00:24:29,480
The photo should identify yourself

391
00:24:29,760 --> 00:24:31,060
Don't lose it

392
00:24:31,090 --> 00:24:32,190
Wait a minute

393
00:24:32,500 --> 00:24:34,010
This isn't me

394
00:24:36,050 --> 00:24:41,960
Debut at 20 years old

395
00:24:39,860 --> 00:24:42,030
Your handbooks didn't match the photos, I see

396
00:24:42,870 --> 00:24:46,600
Funny Face

397
00:24:50,160 --> 00:24:52,620
I couldn't help but laugh at Endo's adorable face

398
00:24:55,810 --> 00:24:57,700
The hell is here
It's here

399
00:24:57,710 --> 00:24:59,610
This isn't good

400
00:24:59,660 --> 00:25:01,910
My ass is receiving some serious beat-downs this year

401
00:25:02,010 --> 00:25:03,640
Anyway, I'm pretty sure there's been a mix up here

402
00:25:03,750 --> 00:25:05,980
OK then, make sure to grab your own photo

403
00:25:03,840 --> 00:25:05,100
Here's mine

404
00:25:06,150 --> 00:25:17,100
New to Show Business

405
00:25:25,760 --> 00:25:27,160
Nice face !

406
00:25:27,730 --> 00:25:30,950
Let's turn to page two

407
00:25:30,950 --> 00:25:33,240
I don't get the purpose of that editing

408
00:25:32,240 --> 00:25:34,540
You see three police officer oaths

409
00:25:34,540 --> 00:25:36,360
I'm going to have you read them aloud

410
00:25:36,760 --> 00:25:41,460
Police ID Handbook Trap 2: Police Officer Oaths

411
00:25:42,810 --> 00:25:48,260
Can they read the difficult Kanji (Chinese Characters)
used in the oaths ?

412
00:25:48,560 --> 00:25:51,960
It will surely test their knowledge !!

413
00:25:52,560 --> 00:25:55,360
Hamada, will you read the first one, please ?

414
00:25:55,460 --> 00:25:58,660
Oath 1
I pledge to respect everyone's rights,

415
00:25:58,290 --> 00:25:59,080
Hamada,

416
00:26:00,460 --> 00:26:02,180
What's good about reading it so normally ?

417
00:26:02,800 --> 00:26:04,810
Will you read it as you "Shakure" ??

418
00:26:04,950 --> 00:26:12,610
Oath 1
I pledge to respect everyone's rights

419
00:26:15,180 --> 00:26:24,210
faithfully perform my duties

420
00:26:24,810 --> 00:26:27,610
and strengthen social solidarity

421
00:26:30,730 --> 00:26:33,350
Yamasaki, why don't you read us the second one ?

422
00:26:33,620 --> 00:26:35,470
Pledge 2
I pledge to develop my character

423
00:26:35,820 --> 00:26:37,590
Hey, do the "Shakure"

424
00:26:39,470 --> 00:26:43,760
Oath 2
I pledge to develop my character

425
00:26:47,910 --> 00:26:49,760
You purposely changed your voice just now

426
00:26:51,100 --> 00:26:52,400
You definitely did

427
00:26:52,400 --> 00:26:53,400
Totally uncalled for

428
00:26:53,400 --> 00:26:54,550
Not cool at all

429
00:26:55,550 --> 00:26:56,980
Don't be changing your voice

430
00:26:56,980 --> 00:26:58,860
It was premeditated

431
00:26:58,860 --> 00:27:00,510
He was playing dirty

432
00:27:00,510 --> 00:27:01,890
No sir, I wasn't

433
00:27:01,890 --> 00:27:03,680
Why can't he use his normal voice ?

434
00:27:07,930 --> 00:27:08,970
Please continue, Yamasaki

435
00:27:09,680 --> 00:27:12,820
Oath 2
I pledge to develop my character

436
00:27:13,650 --> 00:27:16,940
by enriching my self-worth and expanding my capacity

437
00:27:16,970 --> 00:27:18,290
to retain a sound attitude

438
00:27:18,760 --> 00:27:20,300
I know I wouldn't have survived this one

439
00:27:19,160 --> 00:27:20,430
Endo, you're up

440
00:27:21,290 --> 00:27:25,100
Pledge 3
As a police man,

441
00:27:26,670 --> 00:27:27,980
That's enough outta you !!

442
00:27:41,030 --> 00:27:42,870
Read it like you normally would

443
00:27:44,830 --> 00:27:49,930
Oath 3
I pledge not to neglect my mission to better myself as a police man

444
00:27:50,730 --> 00:27:54,520
and to refrain from a frivolous attitude

445
00:28:00,350 --> 00:28:03,000
Not good with Kanji

446
00:28:04,320 --> 00:28:06,650
and to refrain from a frivolous attitude

447
00:28:13,260 --> 00:28:14,260
You can do this

448
00:28:29,080 --> 00:28:34,510
so that citizens of all kinds

449
00:28:36,180 --> 00:28:41,360
can be protected

450
00:28:41,560 --> 00:28:45,620
can be protected

451
00:28:46,860 --> 00:28:50,010
can be protected

452
00:28:50,010 --> 00:28:53,510
RISSEN

453
00:28:50,010 --> 00:28:55,390
SOSSEN (By any means)

454
00:29:00,960 --> 00:29:03,810
Man, this kept the butt-slappers busy

455
00:29:07,860 --> 00:29:09,140
Endo, continue

456
00:29:10,310 --> 00:29:14,680
And that's ....

457
00:29:15,120 --> 00:29:18,010
And that's...

458
00:29:18,180 --> 00:29:23,060
And that's ...

459
00:29:23,400 --> 00:29:26,350
RYUSEKI

460
00:29:23,400 --> 00:29:27,760
SASUGA (Who I should be as a...)

461
00:29:26,900 --> 00:29:27,900
You messed up on purpose !

462
00:29:44,760 --> 00:29:46,910
No wonder you guys were falling apart

463
00:29:47,500 --> 00:29:48,460
Thank God, it's over

464
00:29:51,660 --> 00:29:53,310
You guys still have a long way to go

465
00:29:57,060 --> 00:29:58,360
Do you really need that ?

466
00:29:58,510 --> 00:29:59,660
Excuse me ?

467
00:30:00,000 --> 00:30:05,000
Translation by Shibatabread
www.shibatabread.com

468
00:30:03,800 --> 00:30:04,800
What ?

469
00:30:22,800 --> 00:30:24,550
Give me a break, guys

470
00:30:25,100 --> 00:30:27,640
Hosei san, you don't need to hang onto that, do you ?

471
00:30:31,610 --> 00:30:33,810
I don't know how much more of this I can take

472
00:30:38,070 --> 00:30:40,490
I bet it's not even close to noon yet

473
00:30:40,800 --> 00:30:42,540
No way to tell what time it is

474
00:30:43,140 --> 00:30:47,950
No Clock in the Room

475
00:30:46,740 --> 00:30:48,260
They didn't give us clocks again this year

476
00:30:50,100 --> 00:30:55,970
They take advantage of being spared from tricks and set-ups for a moment

477
00:30:56,130 --> 00:30:58,120
Time for a brief break

478
00:31:01,000 --> 00:31:04,100
God, I would love to open these drawers

479
00:31:04,800 --> 00:31:08,050
They couldn't have possibly set anything up in the drawers

480
00:31:09,250 --> 00:31:12,550
Do you know how many times I've been through this "Batsu Game" series ?

481
00:31:12,600 --> 00:31:15,850
This is Yamasaki's 4th Consecutive Batsu Game

482
00:31:14,800 --> 00:31:16,050
You deserve a medal for your attendance

483
00:31:16,190 --> 00:31:18,550
Having said that, we should still open these drawers

484
00:31:18,650 --> 00:31:19,160
Just in case ?

485
00:31:19,600 --> 00:31:20,800
I'll go first then

486
00:31:22,350 --> 00:31:34,150
More than enough photos of Chiaki

487
00:31:26,600 --> 00:31:28,060
I was shocked

488
00:31:38,300 --> 00:31:40,200
That's just plain cruel

489
00:31:42,740 --> 00:31:44,620
How can there be so many photos of her ?

490
00:31:50,500 --> 00:31:52,500
She must have provided these to the show

491
00:31:52,300 --> 00:31:54,150
I think you're right

492
00:31:55,300 --> 00:31:58,970
In fact, she told me she once was an honorary policewoman for a day

493
00:31:58,970 --> 00:32:02,500
Chiaki, Chief for a Day

494
00:31:59,100 --> 00:32:00,390
That's from that day then ?

495
00:32:00,400 --> 00:32:01,080
Yes, it is

496
00:32:02,710 --> 00:32:04,860
This must be from one of her CD's ?

497
00:32:04,550 --> 00:32:05,140
Yes

498
00:32:05,970 --> 00:32:07,650
I've seen this one before

499
00:32:13,300 --> 00:32:15,000
Hosei san, could you open your drawers ?

500
00:32:15,100 --> 00:32:17,190
You think you got something in there ?

501
00:32:17,810 --> 00:32:20,700
Why don't you come a little closer ?

502
00:32:22,730 --> 00:32:26,800
Empty

503
00:32:31,400 --> 00:32:33,410
You deserve nothing or what ?

504
00:32:36,250 --> 00:32:38,020
You would have laughed at anything

505
00:32:38,400 --> 00:32:39,940
Anything would've made you laugh

506
00:32:40,340 --> 00:32:43,300
It definitely caught me off guard

507
00:32:43,450 --> 00:32:44,950
I guess I was thinking too much into it

508
00:32:48,150 --> 00:32:49,900
How about this one then ?

509
00:33:04,550 --> 00:33:06,000
Sorry about that

510
00:33:06,050 --> 00:33:07,680
How about you, Hamada san ?

511
00:33:07,680 --> 00:33:11,360
I don't believe I have anything here

512
00:33:13,410 --> 00:33:16,990
Banana Peels

513
00:33:22,300 --> 00:33:24,820
What the hell was that ?

514
00:33:25,490 --> 00:33:27,560
Cut me some slack

515
00:33:33,140 --> 00:33:37,930
The production team must've predicted who would open their drawers first

516
00:33:40,300 --> 00:33:42,320
Who eats that many bananas ?

517
00:33:43,260 --> 00:33:44,790
Could there be more...?

518
00:33:46,100 --> 00:33:53,230
Bananas x 3

519
00:33:48,980 --> 00:33:50,870
Drawer full of bananas

520
00:33:54,900 --> 00:34:03,130
Bananas x2

521
00:34:00,010 --> 00:34:01,340
How many do you want ?

522
00:34:02,130 --> 00:34:03,590
How much is enough ?

523
00:34:03,200 --> 00:34:06,000
You're not really a banana type of guy though

524
00:34:12,540 --> 00:34:14,150
Gong !!

525
00:34:16,190 --> 00:34:17,780
How's it going, Onii (big brother) ?

526
00:34:18,390 --> 00:34:19,450
I am Chiaki

527
00:34:18,400 --> 00:34:22,700
Chiaki

528
00:34:19,550 --> 00:34:22,820
Shozo Endo's wife, Chiaki, announces the 10:00am hour

529
00:34:36,350 --> 00:34:38,530
This is way more Chiaki than I can handle

530
00:34:42,090 --> 00:34:43,940
Will she show up every hour then ?

531
00:34:44,640 --> 00:34:45,860
Once every hour ?

532
00:34:46,740 --> 00:34:48,300
Not sure, but it's 10:00am now

533
00:34:48,590 --> 00:34:50,530
I bet she's announcing every hour

534
00:34:51,910 --> 00:34:54,490
Your wife's getting a crap load of exposure

535
00:34:55,960 --> 00:34:58,260
She's definitely in on this

536
00:34:59,200 --> 00:35:00,600
Why does she call you "Onii" ??

537
00:35:07,200 --> 00:35:07,930
What ?

538
00:35:23,800 --> 00:35:25,290
She started calling me "Onii"

539
00:35:26,440 --> 00:35:29,600
while we were still dating

540
00:35:30,700 --> 00:35:32,700
She didn't call me "Onii" (big brother)
in a literal sense

541
00:35:32,790 --> 00:35:34,910
More like "someone she can look up to" ??

542
00:35:33,710 --> 00:35:35,760
Yes, more or less

543
00:35:36,640 --> 00:35:38,990
What does your wife call you, Hamada san ?

544
00:35:42,330 --> 00:35:43,940
Don't be a moron !

545
00:35:44,540 --> 00:35:46,890
Why the hell do you gotta ask me that ?

546
00:35:47,690 --> 00:35:50,000
There's nothing wrong with that question

547
00:35:51,110 --> 00:35:52,470
It was a very natural conversation

548
00:35:56,150 --> 00:35:58,610
I thought I would ask you now

549
00:35:59,660 --> 00:36:02,080
While Chiaki calls me "Onii" at home

550
00:36:03,340 --> 00:36:04,600
what does your wife call you at home ?

551
00:36:05,050 --> 00:36:08,100
I'm guessing she refers to you differently in public than private

552
00:36:11,200 --> 00:36:12,200
not sure...

553
00:36:13,710 --> 00:36:14,880
What does she call you ?

554
00:36:30,010 --> 00:36:32,480
It isn't anything funny but...

555
00:36:35,310 --> 00:36:37,230
You guys are attacking each other hard this year

556
00:36:37,760 --> 00:36:39,620
We were destroying ourselves

557
00:36:42,710 --> 00:36:45,430
She takes my name and calls me "Mah-chan"

558
00:36:45,500 --> 00:36:47,500
Mah-chan ?

559
00:37:09,000 --> 00:37:11,400
The break time is over

560
00:37:13,100 --> 00:37:17,640
Let's go outside for the monthly meeting

561
00:37:25,050 --> 00:37:25,730
Wow

562
00:37:26,070 --> 00:37:26,760
Wow

563
00:37:27,750 --> 00:37:31,000
Shakure Site Wide Meeting

564
00:37:35,400 --> 00:37:39,480
Let us start the monthly meeting

565
00:37:40,260 --> 00:37:43,150
Shakure Police Station
Rally to Eradicate Crime

566
00:37:43,570 --> 00:37:46,200
First, our chief has a few words to share

567
00:37:46,680 --> 00:37:50,710
Greetings from the Shakure Police Chief !!

568
00:37:53,110 --> 00:37:55,000
Shakure Police Chief
Shinji Yamashita

569
00:38:13,080 --> 00:38:15,720
Good morning to all the Shakure officers

570
00:38:16,750 --> 00:38:18,390
I'm your police chief, Yamashita

571
00:38:20,200 --> 00:38:25,460
Today, I will ask you to think about

572
00:38:25,520 --> 00:38:29,230
what it is to be "Shakure"

573
00:38:29,600 --> 00:38:30,750
What the hell ?

574
00:38:30,800 --> 00:38:36,000
A true "Shakure" resides within each one of us

575
00:38:36,520 --> 00:38:38,900
Sadly,

576
00:38:38,990 --> 00:38:41,390
I'm not "Shakure" physically

577
00:38:42,720 --> 00:38:43,800
But emotionally,

578
00:38:44,680 --> 00:38:47,380
I'm more "Shakure" than anybody else !!

579
00:38:48,600 --> 00:38:50,410
What the hell is that supposed to mean ?

580
00:38:51,120 --> 00:38:52,180
So, let's hear it

581
00:38:52,920 --> 00:38:55,570
SHAKURE

582
00:38:56,890 --> 00:38:59,000
SHAKURE

583
00:39:00,160 --> 00:39:01,330
That is all

584
00:39:03,310 --> 00:39:05,040
Here's the juvenile divisional manager,

585
00:39:05,530 --> 00:39:07,260
Mr. Mikami, um um...

586
00:39:07,400 --> 00:39:11,050
will address his thoughts on crime eradication month

587
00:39:11,890 --> 00:39:16,610
Juvenile Divisional Manager Speech !!

588
00:39:17,490 --> 00:39:19,360
I'm Mikami from the Juvenile Division

589
00:39:20,120 --> 00:39:24,350
Thick Northeastern Dialect

590
00:39:22,370 --> 00:39:25,470
I've been hearing disturbing news about

591
00:39:25,940 --> 00:39:27,230
drugs and guns

592
00:39:28,090 --> 00:39:30,820
[Indiscernible]

593
00:39:38,000 --> 00:39:40,600
I couldn't tell what the heck he was saying

594
00:39:40,800 --> 00:39:43,270
You can see officers behind you laughing, too

595
00:39:46,800 --> 00:39:48,400
This isn't easy to survive

596
00:39:48,400 --> 00:39:49,400
No, it was not

597
00:39:50,340 --> 00:39:55,970
[indiscernible]

598
00:39:55,850 --> 00:39:58,780
This was a long speech, too

599
00:40:07,000 --> 00:40:08,000
Hey, pay attention

600
00:40:08,200 --> 00:40:12,800
Officers Horsing Around

601
00:40:08,800 --> 00:40:10,730
Zip it

602
00:40:15,600 --> 00:40:16,750
You two in the front !

603
00:40:16,800 --> 00:40:17,830
Don't make me say it again

604
00:40:17,830 --> 00:40:19,000
Shut up and pay attention !

605
00:40:36,110 --> 00:40:40,550
Death to 2 Officers- Execution Style

606
00:40:51,000 --> 00:40:53,130
Who cares about being "OUT" at this point ?!

607
00:40:58,600 --> 00:41:00,230
That manager's pretty funny

608
00:41:00,400 --> 00:41:01,790
Thank you, manager

609
00:41:02,270 --> 00:41:06,660
Next, we're honoring those who helped to make our city safer

610
00:41:07,890 --> 00:41:11,000
Just last week, this group arrested 86 members of a notorious speeding gang

611
00:41:08,210 --> 00:41:14,000
Honoring the outstanding officers !!

612
00:41:11,600 --> 00:41:13,430
Motorcycle team, please come up here

613
00:41:18,000 --> 00:41:19,830
Here's a certificate of recognition

614
00:41:20,490 --> 00:41:22,090
for our superior motorcycle team

615
00:41:23,570 --> 00:41:25,770
whose efforts make our city safer

616
00:41:28,870 --> 00:41:30,610
Nice Ray-Ban sunglasses

617
00:41:35,070 --> 00:41:36,500
Too funny

618
00:41:46,000 --> 00:41:47,950
Why did he have to let me know ?

619
00:41:50,200 --> 00:41:54,000
Endo tries to make Hamada laugh

620
00:41:58,000 --> 00:41:59,320
I spotted him

621
00:41:59,320 --> 00:42:01,910
I didn't mean to but I did

622
00:42:03,860 --> 00:42:06,300
Besides, why doesn't he wanna come outside ?

623
00:42:09,210 --> 00:42:10,570
Why is he staying inside ?

624
00:42:11,340 --> 00:42:13,920
Here's an officer who keeps our ocean safe

625
00:42:13,920 --> 00:42:14,740
by patrolling with his dolphin

626
00:42:14,790 --> 00:42:15,800
"Dolphin" Officer

627
00:42:16,040 --> 00:42:17,470
please, come forward

628
00:42:18,000 --> 00:42:19,700
Who ?

629
00:42:21,050 --> 00:42:26,000
A boy who got to ride a dolphin

630
00:42:26,700 --> 00:42:29,900
"Dolphin" Officer
Michiru Joe

631
00:42:32,280 --> 00:42:34,300
My generation should know him well

632
00:42:33,060 --> 00:42:39,010
On Sale in 1973

633
00:42:35,670 --> 00:42:37,790
You guys don't who this is, huh ?

634
00:42:38,180 --> 00:42:39,120
I didn't know who he was

635
00:42:40,740 --> 00:42:43,390
I remember this guy being a "teen idol" back then

636
00:42:58,150 --> 00:42:59,830
This is awful

637
00:43:01,650 --> 00:43:05,190
They Laughed - No Interruption Until the End of the Song

638
00:43:07,030 --> 00:43:08,260
Why is he singing here anyway ?

639
00:43:46,130 --> 00:43:51,440
Let us conclude this rally with a song

640
00:43:52,240 --> 00:43:53,340
What the hell ?

641
00:43:53,780 --> 00:44:01,620
Shakure Police Station Song

642
00:44:02,670 --> 00:44:10,070
Embracing pride higher than Mt. Fuji

643
00:44:11,860 --> 00:44:19,450
Enables us to capture criminals night and day

644
00:44:21,270 --> 00:44:29,630
There will be some tough days, but don't cry

645
00:44:30,460 --> 00:44:35,370
Dancing on the floor of criminals

646
00:44:36,050 --> 00:44:40,040
I'm alone again

647
00:44:40,520 --> 00:44:42,050
What kinda message is this ?

648
00:44:42,560 --> 00:44:43,670
I know, I don't get this

649
00:44:44,560 --> 00:44:49,020
So don't be

650
00:44:47,990 --> 00:44:50,250
Wait, didn't the chief say he's mentally shakure ??

651
00:44:50,000 --> 00:44:51,600
Shakure emotionally

652
00:44:53,480 --> 00:44:54,430
Let's hear it

653
00:44:54,880 --> 00:44:57,460
Shakure, shakure

654
00:44:57,890 --> 00:45:01,840
Shakure Police Station

655
00:45:06,270 --> 00:45:09,590
This concludes our monthly rally

656
00:45:10,690 --> 00:45:12,700
Dismissed !!

657
00:45:19,650 --> 00:45:20,770
Why don't we head back ?

658
00:45:24,100 --> 00:45:29,430
Only 2 hours have passed
But the three already show signs of fatigue

659
00:45:29,890 --> 00:45:34,320
But the Batsu Game is about to
become even tougher

660
00:45:35,560 --> 00:45:37,840
The day has just begun

661
00:45:39,220 --> 00:45:41,300
There's so much stuff going on already

662
00:45:41,300 --> 00:45:43,500
I'd say too much

663
00:45:43,500 --> 00:45:45,620
You guys have zero team-work

664
00:45:46,100 --> 00:45:48,760
We saw lot of times when you trapped each other

665
00:45:49,570 --> 00:45:52,780
We had such chemistry back when we did
the "Don't laugh at High School"

666
00:45:53,380 --> 00:45:56,390
There was great communication among us

667
00:45:57,010 --> 00:45:59,460
But now, you just care about yourselves

668
00:46:00,010 --> 00:46:01,770
Especially you, Endo

669
00:46:02,620 --> 00:46:05,760
When I see something funny, I naturally want to share that with Hamada san

670
00:46:06,270 --> 00:46:07,460
I don't need it, seriously

671
00:46:08,800 --> 00:46:10,420
What's interesting about watching this

672
00:46:10,910 --> 00:46:13,690
is that it definitely shows everyone's personalities

673
00:46:14,130 --> 00:46:15,840
I can see who is prone to laugh at certain things

674
00:46:16,860 --> 00:46:18,310
What about Yamasaki though ?

675
00:46:18,700 --> 00:46:20,500
Well, he pretty much laughs at anything thrown at him

676
00:46:20,550 --> 00:46:21,200
What's this ?

677
00:46:21,350 --> 00:46:22,400
You know what else ?

678
00:46:22,550 --> 00:46:23,900
Your facial expression isn't fair

679
00:46:24,000 --> 00:46:26,000
The faces you make tend to make everyone laugh

680
00:46:26,170 --> 00:46:28,120
But that is my normal face expression

681
00:46:28,960 --> 00:46:31,080
You're just accusing me of TRYING to make you guys laugh

682
00:46:37,270 --> 00:46:37,860
See ?

683
00:46:38,540 --> 00:46:39,690
What'd you mean "See ?"

684
00:46:40,080 --> 00:46:40,780
I don't get it

685
00:46:40,280 --> 00:46:42,000
Stop making weird awkward pauses

686
00:46:43,500 --> 00:46:45,110
I can't, that's how I am

687
00:46:45,300 --> 00:46:46,390
Start

688
00:46:46,750 --> 00:46:47,130
the

689
00:46:49,580 --> 00:46:50,540
Video

690
00:46:51,180 --> 00:46:52,460
Not very funny, I see

691
00:46:53,750 --> 00:46:58,790
Outside Duty
Means More Terror of Laughter !!

692
00:46:58,700 --> 00:47:12,350
Traffic Officers' Training

693
00:46:59,300 --> 00:47:04,100
Storm of Hysteria

694
00:47:02,970 --> 00:47:09,450
Could there be...

695
00:47:04,580 --> 00:47:06,600
Huge Crash

696
00:47:12,600 --> 00:47:16,150
An Emergency Strikes the Shakure Police Station !!

697
00:47:16,800 --> 00:47:26,470
Bomb Squad Member
Risks his Life !!

698
00:47:20,590 --> 00:47:22,070
Proceed with caution, got it?

699
00:47:26,620 --> 00:47:31,330
Matsumoto and Tanaka Raid  the Station !!

700
00:47:31,400 --> 00:47:37,240
Batsu Game Turns More Sinister !!

701
00:47:40,720 --> 00:47:43,410
At last, the trainees are ready for duty

702
00:47:47,600 --> 00:47:51,610
Let's go train with the Traffic Officers

703
00:47:53,460 --> 00:47:54,330
Shall we ?

704
00:47:55,360 --> 00:47:58,520
Do we really need to join them ?

705
00:48:01,070 --> 00:48:02,680
Endo, sit behind me

706
00:48:03,090 --> 00:48:04,290
Hamada, you're in the middle

707
00:48:04,650 --> 00:48:06,170
and Yamasaki, you're behind the passenger seat

708
00:48:06,640 --> 00:48:09,330
I see, you guys can't just sit around the station all day

709
00:48:07,670 --> 00:48:12,400
Empty Bento Box Trash on the Floor

710
00:48:22,050 --> 00:48:25,620
This set-up is very subtle but apparently effective

711
00:48:29,590 --> 00:48:33,060
As officers, I expect you to use seatbelts

712
00:48:37,810 --> 00:48:44,250
Hamada Uses a Rope for Seatbelt

713
00:48:45,860 --> 00:48:52,570
They're off to traffic training
What will they face there ?

714
00:48:53,730 --> 00:48:54,440
Hey, Hamada

715
00:48:55,940 --> 00:48:58,480
How old is your stupid son ?

716
00:49:02,000 --> 00:49:04,550
Well, the oldest one is ready to start the high school

717
00:49:05,120 --> 00:49:08,120
Even the stupid have to grow up eventually, I guess

718
00:49:08,960 --> 00:49:10,240
Yes, indeed

719
00:49:11,050 --> 00:49:11,940
Hey Yamasaki,

720
00:49:12,560 --> 00:49:15,230
How old is your daughter, Momo-chan ?

721
00:49:15,770 --> 00:49:17,570
She's 5 years old now

722
00:49:19,050 --> 00:49:21,850
How come your answers are so normal and boring ?

723
00:49:23,500 --> 00:49:24,220
Hey, Endo

724
00:49:25,680 --> 00:49:29,360
How old is your daughter, Hoheto ?

725
00:49:27,880 --> 00:49:29,300
Her name is Iroha !

726
00:49:29,600 --> 00:49:32,450
How old is Hoheto ?

727
00:49:30,690 --> 00:49:32,360
She's IROHA !

728
00:49:32,720 --> 00:49:35,060
A girl like Hoheto

729
00:49:33,200 --> 00:49:34,880
IROHA !

730
00:49:35,000 --> 00:49:37,690
Even a girl like Hoheto

731
00:49:36,380 --> 00:49:37,690
IROHA !

732
00:49:37,760 --> 00:49:41,480
Hohe....um..a girl like Hoheto

733
00:49:41,480 --> 00:49:44,040
must have a dream for the future right ?

734
00:49:44,210 --> 00:49:47,660
She's still too young to think like that
She's Iroha, by the way

735
00:49:47,860 --> 00:49:51,790
As long as you're getting along with Hoheto, that's all I ask for

736
00:49:51,360 --> 00:49:53,600
OK...

737
00:49:53,350 --> 00:49:54,670
You gave up, didn't you ?

738
00:49:55,260 --> 00:49:56,780
Man, it's so desolate

739
00:49:57,790 --> 00:49:59,050
Looks like a peaceful town

740
00:49:59,470 --> 00:50:01,960
I need to get some gas

741
00:50:04,400 --> 00:50:08,690
Police car detours into
a gas station

742
00:50:07,960 --> 00:50:09,730
I'd say this was really tough

743
00:50:10,590 --> 00:50:12,260
ZET !!

744
00:50:11,490 --> 00:50:12,490
Hear him ?

745
00:50:12,590 --> 00:50:13,940
ZET !!

746
00:50:15,330 --> 00:50:17,590
ZET !!

747
00:50:16,190 --> 00:50:18,290
Where else can you find this kind of service ?

748
00:50:18,690 --> 00:50:19,870
How may I help you ?

749
00:50:19,160 --> 00:50:25,090
Gas Station Attendant
Ichiro Mizuki

750
00:50:23,690 --> 00:50:25,330
Could you pull up further please ?

751
00:50:30,560 --> 00:50:33,760
They almost got me with that one

752
00:50:36,410 --> 00:50:40,300
That must've sucked having to get out of the car each time

753
00:50:39,790 --> 00:50:40,840
Alright

754
00:50:41,590 --> 00:50:42,490
Alright

755
00:50:42,890 --> 00:50:43,590
Alright

756
00:50:44,330 --> 00:50:46,930
Alright ZET !!

757
00:50:47,040 --> 00:50:49,700
What's "ZET" have to do with anything ?

758
00:50:47,190 --> 00:50:49,890
Regular or Premium ?

759
00:50:49,190 --> 00:50:50,190
Premium please

760
00:50:50,070 --> 00:50:52,780
Premium ZET !!

761
00:50:57,350 --> 00:51:00,080
We've got to hold ourselves together

762
00:51:03,260 --> 00:51:05,170
ZET !!

763
00:51:06,590 --> 00:51:09,190
Do you have a membership with us ?

764
00:51:08,390 --> 00:51:09,460
No I don't

765
00:51:10,200 --> 00:51:11,950
How would you like to sign up for free ?

766
00:51:12,330 --> 00:51:13,340
Sounds good

767
00:51:13,760 --> 00:51:15,850
Enrollment ZET !!

768
00:51:22,930 --> 00:51:26,720
What does he mean by "Enrollment ZET" ??

769
00:51:26,590 --> 00:51:28,700
Allow me to clean out the ashtray

770
00:51:27,670 --> 00:51:29,730
Thank you

771
00:51:36,660 --> 00:51:37,240
We can do it

772
00:51:37,630 --> 00:51:38,680
We can do it

773
00:51:40,890 --> 00:51:42,100
zet

774
00:51:43,090 --> 00:51:44,010
zet

775
00:51:45,190 --> 00:51:46,030
zet

776
00:51:50,700 --> 00:51:53,290
Was Mr. Mizuki always like this ?

777
00:51:58,450 --> 00:52:00,210
No, he's never been like this

778
00:52:04,960 --> 00:52:05,990
zet

779
00:52:07,140 --> 00:52:07,950
zet

780
00:52:10,480 --> 00:52:11,660
zet

781
00:52:11,790 --> 00:52:16,240
Mr. Mizuki is clumsy with the equipment

782
00:52:14,660 --> 00:52:16,930
He had no idea how to use that thing

783
00:52:22,480 --> 00:52:24,630
He can't operate it right

784
00:52:25,010 --> 00:52:25,960
zet

785
00:52:26,290 --> 00:52:28,290
Wow ! Gas spill !!

786
00:52:28,180 --> 00:52:29,500
How dangerous ?!

787
00:52:29,590 --> 00:52:30,590
Wait a sec

788
00:52:30,640 --> 00:52:32,350
I'm covered in gasoline !

789
00:52:37,860 --> 00:52:39,750
Not good, not good, not good

790
00:52:42,350 --> 00:52:44,700
Mr. Mizuki, please

791
00:52:49,730 --> 00:52:50,960
Can we go please ?

792
00:52:51,410 --> 00:52:52,490
Let's go

793
00:52:53,480 --> 00:52:54,900
Will you be pulling out to the right or the left

794
00:52:55,310 --> 00:52:56,460
To the right please

795
00:52:56,520 --> 00:52:58,370
Right ZET !!

796
00:53:03,890 --> 00:53:05,610
We can do this, Hosei san

797
00:53:06,170 --> 00:53:07,290
I didn't laugh though

798
00:53:11,710 --> 00:53:12,400
ZET !

799
00:53:14,580 --> 00:53:15,400
ZET !!

800
00:53:17,350 --> 00:53:18,240
ZET !!

801
00:53:22,090 --> 00:53:23,590
ZET !!

802
00:53:26,700 --> 00:53:27,810
ZET !!

803
00:53:29,790 --> 00:53:31,330
I think I can still hear him

804
00:53:31,900 --> 00:53:33,590
Indeed, he's not a quitter

805
00:53:34,270 --> 00:53:35,460
ZET !!

806
00:53:36,890 --> 00:53:40,880
With a full tank of gas,
the three are ready for their next mission

807
00:53:41,240 --> 00:53:43,170
We should be able to join up with
the rest of the traffic officers

808
00:53:43,680 --> 00:53:45,560
I have a feeling their training must be hard

809
00:53:45,790 --> 00:53:50,590
Why are we bothering them during their training anyway ?

810
00:53:50,590 --> 00:53:52,790
Is it imperative that we join their training ?

811
00:53:52,870 --> 00:53:54,170
Yes, of course

812
00:53:54,490 --> 00:53:56,140
We're actually participating ?

813
00:53:57,330 --> 00:53:58,510
Wow

814
00:53:59,180 --> 00:54:05,200
Participation in Traffic Officers' Training

815
00:54:06,380 --> 00:54:07,790
Why don't you line up here ?

816
00:54:10,340 --> 00:54:12,360
The captain should be here any minute

817
00:54:13,440 --> 00:54:14,680
Don't forget to give a formal greeting

818
00:54:15,880 --> 00:54:18,170
I heard he delivers nasty and tough stare-downs

819
00:54:30,940 --> 00:54:35,790
Traffic Dept. Captain
Naomasa Musaka

820
00:54:42,750 --> 00:54:46,470
I'm Captain Musaka and I'm in charge
of the traffic department

821
00:54:46,890 --> 00:54:48,650
I see some new faces here

822
00:55:08,440 --> 00:55:10,020
This was in such a bad taste

823
00:55:15,590 --> 00:55:16,590
That's pretty gross

824
00:55:17,800 --> 00:55:20,360
Did you see how close he put his face up to mine ?

825
00:55:20,390 --> 00:55:21,390
Disgusting

826
00:55:24,880 --> 00:55:25,970
Get back in line

827
00:55:28,600 --> 00:55:32,090
There's definitely some dangerous elements in today's training

828
00:55:33,330 --> 00:55:37,970
If you're not 100% focused, one could lose his life

829
00:55:39,040 --> 00:55:41,590
Chapstick

830
00:55:47,400 --> 00:55:48,500
Just last week

831
00:55:49,720 --> 00:55:51,180
because of my negligence

832
00:55:51,730 --> 00:55:55,950
50 to 60 trainees lost their lives

833
00:55:58,890 --> 00:56:00,390
He should be fired !!

834
00:56:04,380 --> 00:56:06,410
How can he still be the captain then ?

835
00:56:07,390 --> 00:56:09,590
He killed 50 to 60 trainees ?

836
00:56:10,400 --> 00:56:11,180
Line up

837
00:56:13,450 --> 00:56:14,400
You got that ?

838
00:56:15,120 --> 00:56:18,680
I'm letting you smell my breath

839
00:56:21,100 --> 00:56:23,160
This isn't fair

840
00:56:30,090 --> 00:56:31,490
Why his "breath" ?

841
00:56:44,590 --> 00:56:45,730
Salute

842
00:56:57,740 --> 00:56:59,040
What was up with that ?

843
00:56:59,140 --> 00:57:00,640
He's out of control

844
00:57:00,840 --> 00:57:02,340
Why don't we move over this way ?

845
00:57:02,730 --> 00:57:03,200
What ?

846
00:57:04,170 --> 00:57:06,010
You are in "stand by" mode

847
00:57:06,390 --> 00:57:07,490
That captain was terrible

848
00:57:07,690 --> 00:57:08,990
What's wrong with him ?

849
00:57:12,660 --> 00:57:19,850
Rule:
Training begins with one trainee at a time

850
00:57:16,950 --> 00:57:18,590
I don't like this already

851
00:57:21,910 --> 00:57:28,650
Rule:
You're free to laugh at anytime during the training

852
00:57:23,180 --> 00:57:24,150
What ?

853
00:57:24,660 --> 00:57:25,660
Sounds good, doesn't it ?

854
00:57:26,470 --> 00:57:27,990
Well, it sounds good in a scary way

855
00:57:29,520 --> 00:57:36,530
Rule:
Punishment Delivered for SCREAMING at anytime during the training

856
00:57:32,300 --> 00:57:34,580
See, I don't like this one bit

857
00:57:34,580 --> 00:57:36,640
I'm going to hate this

858
00:57:36,920 --> 00:57:38,040
Let's see who goes first

859
00:57:39,240 --> 00:57:40,780
How about Hamada? You're up first

860
00:57:40,090 --> 00:57:41,090
What ?

861
00:57:46,230 --> 00:57:56,760
Extreme Driving Technique Experience !!

862
00:57:49,250 --> 00:57:56,580
Drifting

863
00:57:50,290 --> 00:57:56,580
2-Wheel Driving

864
00:57:57,290 --> 00:58:01,710
The 3 have no idea what they are about to experience

865
00:58:03,800 --> 00:58:06,050
Man, I didn't sign up for this

866
00:58:07,600 --> 00:58:09,890
Hamada

867
00:58:10,630 --> 00:58:11,970
Take it easy, OK ?

868
00:58:38,310 --> 00:58:41,180
We don't need this long one

869
00:58:49,680 --> 00:58:50,330
Stop it

870
00:58:50,740 --> 00:58:51,620
Stop it

871
00:58:53,420 --> 00:58:54,660
Stop it

872
00:58:55,060 --> 00:58:55,670
Stop it

873
00:59:08,640 --> 00:59:09,490
What was that ?

874
00:59:09,790 --> 00:59:11,090
What just happened ?

875
00:59:11,990 --> 00:59:14,020
That was loud

876
00:59:19,290 --> 00:59:20,980
Who cares ?

877
00:59:32,100 --> 00:59:32,970
Hamada

878
00:59:33,640 --> 00:59:35,430
This way

879
00:59:38,460 --> 00:59:39,370
How was that ?

880
00:59:40,550 --> 00:59:42,310
What can I say ?

881
00:59:44,590 --> 00:59:45,590
Sigh

882
00:59:46,780 --> 00:59:48,000
Yamasaki

883
00:59:49,060 --> 00:59:50,050
You're on

884
00:59:50,140 --> 00:59:50,940
Got that ?

885
00:59:51,510 --> 00:59:52,300
Wait a sec

886
00:59:53,420 --> 00:59:55,030
I didn't want to be last

887
00:59:57,060 --> 01:00:01,420
Training for Yamasaki is even more extreme

It's open ! Listen !

It's open !

Open !

Hey ! The door is open !!

The door is gone !!
It fell off !!

908

Fell off !

909
01:01:00,110 --> 01:01:01,620
Wow, the door's gone

910
01:01:03,810 --> 01:01:07,680
Hamada san, you were laughing hard just then

911
01:01:09,680 --> 01:01:12,010
Countdown to Smoke

912
01:01:18,100 --> 01:01:19,560
Hey, something stinks !

913
01:01:20,420 --> 01:01:21,370
Hey, it stinks !

914
01:01:30,810 --> 01:01:32,380
No ! I'm scared !

915
01:01:33,310 --> 01:01:34,510
What's with the smoke ?

916
01:01:46,900 --> 01:01:48,030
You failed

917
01:01:49,610 --> 01:01:51,610
You were allowed to laugh, right ?

918
01:01:50,810 --> 01:01:53,150
There's no way...

919
01:01:53,910 --> 01:01:55,870
I'm positive I'll be "OUT"

920
01:01:56,870 --> 01:01:58,410
And you get your ass slapped, too

921
01:01:59,810 --> 01:02:01,520
No reaction from you ?

922
01:02:02,310 --> 01:02:04,760
I could have cared less at this point

923
01:02:04,610 --> 01:02:05,570
Yama-chan ?

924
01:02:05,810 --> 01:02:06,780
Yamasaki

925
01:02:07,260 --> 01:02:08,570
It was so terrifying

926
01:02:08,810 --> 01:02:10,030
The door came off, didn't it ?

927
01:02:10,110 --> 01:02:10,760
Yes

928
01:02:11,010 --> 01:02:14,610
I was really stunned, yeah definitely stunned

929
01:02:13,160 --> 01:02:14,150
What the hell ?

930
01:02:15,150 --> 01:02:17,180
What's with your grammar ??

931
01:02:15,180 --> 01:02:17,550
What's gonna happen to Endo ?

932
01:02:18,320 --> 01:02:18,830
Endo

933
01:02:19,270 --> 01:02:19,870
You're up

934
01:02:26,520 --> 01:02:33,910
"Secret" trap

935
01:02:27,180 --> 01:02:34,360
Saving the Best for the Last ?!

936
01:02:36,660 --> 01:02:39,610
Endo

937
01:02:37,510 --> 01:02:38,580
He got it the worst

938
01:02:43,760 --> 01:02:45,650
God, he's going fast

939
01:02:51,020 --> 01:02:51,860
You were doing well here

940
01:02:53,430 --> 01:02:55,370
Yeah, he's holding himself together so far

941
01:03:00,810 --> 01:03:03,410
That's pretty scary

942
01:03:16,470 --> 01:03:18,420
Scared, scared, scared, scared, scared

943
01:03:18,870 --> 01:03:20,910
Countdown to Secret Trap

944
01:03:25,310 --> 01:03:26,710
This is unacceptable

945
01:03:26,810 --> 01:03:28,110
What the...?

946
01:03:33,810 --> 01:03:35,610
Is this an accident or what ?

947
01:03:35,610 --> 01:03:37,000
Hey !

948
01:03:37,000 --> 01:03:38,000
Hey !

949
01:03:38,010 --> 01:03:40,810
Aghhhh !!!

950
01:03:44,770 --> 01:03:47,490
I don't blame you for yelling out for him

951
01:03:49,250 --> 01:03:50,790
You guys are friends

952
01:03:56,500 --> 01:03:58,460
Endo, are you OK ?

953
01:04:06,860 --> 01:04:07,430
How was it ?

954
01:04:08,950 --> 01:04:10,390
Is this really OK ?

955
01:04:11,060 --> 01:04:12,180
This is NOT OK

956
01:04:13,560 --> 01:04:15,110
The car flipped over ?

957
01:04:15,860 --> 01:04:16,770
Yeah, look at it

958
01:04:18,710 --> 01:04:19,860
You didn't realize what happened ?

959
01:04:20,430 --> 01:04:22,810
My mind went completely blank

960
01:04:22,960 --> 01:04:24,540
I had my eyes closed, too

961
01:04:27,810 --> 01:04:29,610
And they still called you "OUT"

962
01:04:29,960 --> 01:04:31,440
I'm like "who's OUT" ??

963
01:04:32,350 --> 01:04:33,280
I was clueless

964
01:04:34,010 --> 01:04:35,220
This training was insane

965
01:04:35,830 --> 01:04:37,160
Incredible

966
01:04:37,210 --> 01:04:38,470
You got some great training here

967
01:04:38,560 --> 01:04:39,480
How so?

968
01:04:40,160 --> 01:04:42,380
I was thinking if Endo couldn't get out of that car on his own

969
01:04:42,560 --> 01:04:45,310
then maybe you guys would just let me go home

970
01:04:46,600 --> 01:04:49,780
They return to the station after their rigorous training

971
01:04:50,300 --> 01:04:55,410
But there's more traps and set-ups waiting for them !!

972
01:04:55,970 --> 01:04:57,700
CB Radio

973
01:04:57,310 --> 01:04:58,110
Emergency !!

974
01:04:58,160 --> 01:04:59,110
Emergency !!

975
01:04:59,380 --> 01:05:01,050
All officers are to report to the station gate

976
01:05:01,360 --> 01:05:04,710
to apprehend a man causing a commotion at the station

977
01:05:05,400 --> 01:05:06,680
Sounds like a lunatic is out and about

978
01:05:07,070 --> 01:05:08,140
Do we have to...

979
01:05:08,650 --> 01:05:09,800
Oh ! I see him up there

980
01:05:19,180 --> 01:05:21,410
I'm afraid I know this guy

981
01:05:22,240 --> 01:05:25,510
Lunatic Appears at the Police Station

982
01:05:23,510 --> 01:05:25,940
I'll show you what "Funny" really is

983
01:05:28,040 --> 01:05:28,940
What a moron

984
01:05:29,960 --> 01:05:31,710
My wife comes from a wealthy family

985
01:05:34,810 --> 01:05:36,160
Where's the laughing ?

986
01:05:37,810 --> 01:05:40,020
I thought that was freakin' funny myself

987
01:05:40,630 --> 01:05:42,710
"My wife comes from a wealthy family" !!

988
01:05:43,810 --> 01:05:45,610
What's with that "choice" ??

989
01:05:45,610 --> 01:05:47,910
Go ahead and laugh

990
01:05:49,340 --> 01:05:53,910
I'm making an ass out of myself because you don't find me funny

991
01:05:55,090 --> 01:05:55,790
How about this then

992
01:05:56,310 --> 01:05:57,920
Once and for all, let's decide if I'm funny or not

993
01:05:58,390 --> 01:05:59,790
I'll come down only if I'm not funny

994
01:06:00,260 --> 01:06:00,860
Sound good ?

995
01:06:02,430 --> 01:06:03,100
Let me start then

996
01:06:03,810 --> 01:06:05,360
Here's a One-Man-Skit

997
01:06:05,410 --> 01:06:06,610
Titled: Inoki Antonio

998
01:06:05,600 --> 01:06:16,310
One-Man-Skit "Inoki Antonio"

999
01:06:06,700 --> 01:06:07,810
Feeling energized ?

1000
01:06:08,660 --> 01:06:09,970
Anything's possible with this energy

1001
01:06:10,340 --> 01:06:11,180
Let's hear it

1002
01:06:19,800 --> 01:06:21,140
No, I'm staying up here

1003
01:06:21,790 --> 01:06:22,610
That's not what I said

1004
01:06:23,280 --> 01:06:24,620
I'll only come down if I'm not funny

1005
01:06:25,340 --> 01:06:26,150
Get a clue

1006
01:06:26,810 --> 01:06:27,910
Do you understand Japanese ?

1007
01:06:27,960 --> 01:06:29,810
You need to ask for help from Doraemon

1008
01:06:30,490 --> 01:06:31,200
No, I'm not coming down

1009
01:06:31,740 --> 01:06:32,490
Absolutely not !

1010
01:06:33,800 --> 01:06:34,840
Here's another One-Man-Skit

1011
01:06:36,460 --> 01:07:17,410
One-Man-Skit "Concert"

1012
01:06:37,640 --> 01:06:39,690
~Let's go find it, Boy

1013
01:06:40,350 --> 01:06:42,720
~Take down all the mutants

1014
01:06:42,980 --> 01:06:47,800
~I'm flying through the sky
with this cloud machine

1015
01:06:50,580 --> 01:06:51,430
into the Mysterious world

1016
01:06:51,940 --> 01:06:54,210
`Flying through the sky and over a mountain

1017
01:06:56,390 --> 01:06:57,240
all the Adventure

1018
01:06:57,770 --> 01:07:01,790
~Let us begin mysterious travels

1019
01:07:03,230 --> 01:07:04,330
Get it now !

1020
01:07:06,230 --> 01:07:08,470
The world's most awesome drama

1021
01:07:09,060 --> 01:07:11,510
This world is full of treasure

1022
01:07:11,990 --> 01:07:15,050
Yes, now is the time for the

1023
01:07:15,050 --> 01:07:16,790
Adven-Ture~

1024
01:07:17,310 --> 01:07:18,310
Way too long

1025
01:07:18,010 --> 01:07:19,420
What a moron

1026
01:07:21,810 --> 01:07:23,810
I told you I'm not coming down

1027
01:07:24,810 --> 01:07:25,770
What a lunie !

1028
01:07:26,150 --> 01:07:27,150
A real lunatic !

1029
01:07:28,590 --> 01:07:30,420
Let's do a classic comic monologue

1030
01:07:31,290 --> 01:07:36,550
I've done many shows at colleges around the nation

1031
01:07:37,080 --> 01:07:39,080
But guess how many shows this comic has done ?

1032
01:07:40,330 --> 01:07:41,410
48 colleges

1033
01:07:42,080 --> 01:07:43,460
Can you believe that, 48 schools?!

1034
01:07:43,950 --> 01:07:45,210
All that in one year

1035
01:07:45,740 --> 01:07:48,160
Well, guess how many schools I've hit ?

1036
01:07:49,290 --> 01:07:50,470
A total of HACHI KOU (8 schools)

1037
01:07:51,030 --> 01:07:52,330
Only HACHI KOU (8 schools)

1038
01:07:52,970 --> 01:07:54,270
What am I? Some kind of dog ?

1039
01:07:55,120 --> 01:08:02,320
*HACHI KOU is also the name of famous dog in Japan

1040
01:08:03,620 --> 01:08:04,960
I admit, that HACHI KOU joke was terrible

1041
01:08:05,520 --> 01:08:06,940
I don't care if you didn't get it

1042
01:08:07,410 --> 01:08:08,670
I see, I'm coming down

1043
01:08:09,640 --> 01:08:11,710
Here, catch this one, please

1044
01:08:14,490 --> 01:08:15,190
Nice catch

1045
01:08:15,700 --> 01:08:16,480
Nice catch-phone

1046
01:08:17,280 --> 01:08:18,050
Hello ?

1047
01:08:28,370 --> 01:08:29,870
Wow, I'm been apprehended !

1048
01:08:30,480 --> 01:08:31,540
Apprehended !

1049
01:08:33,110 --> 01:08:34,810
What a freakin' moron !

1050
01:08:34,810 --> 01:08:35,960
Oh !

1051
01:08:39,350 --> 01:08:43,170
Another Lunatic Appears

1052
01:08:44,270 --> 01:08:45,540
How many of these did you have ?

1053
01:08:49,960 --> 01:08:52,320
Here comes the big guest

1054
01:08:55,720 --> 01:08:56,370
Listen

1055
01:08:57,020 --> 01:08:58,370
Who says I'm not funny ?!

1056
01:08:59,870 --> 01:09:03,780
Yoshinobu Nakamura
(Producer)

1057
01:09:01,380 --> 01:09:03,020
Here's something funny

1058
01:09:05,140 --> 01:09:06,630
One-Man-Skit

1059
01:09:07,960 --> 01:09:09,390
Inoki Antonio

1060
01:09:09,810 --> 01:09:30,010
One-Man-Skit "Inoki Antonio"

1061
01:09:14,950 --> 01:09:16,530
Feeling energized ?

1062
01:09:18,300 --> 01:09:21,570
I, Yoshinobu, can do anything with that energy

1063
01:09:22,010 --> 01:09:22,740
Let's hear it

1064
01:09:29,170 --> 01:09:30,030
How's that ?

1065
01:09:30,480 --> 01:09:31,550
Pretty funny, isn't it ?

1066
01:09:32,120 --> 01:09:33,810
I got it

1067
01:09:34,820 --> 01:09:36,910
I'll let you hear one of my monologues

1068
01:09:39,190 --> 01:09:44,950
I have booked some shows at various colleges this season

1069
01:09:47,110 --> 01:09:52,360
Some of the elite producers have already done 48 schools around the nation

1070
01:09:53,720 --> 01:09:55,770
Well, I have some shows booked

1071
01:09:57,290 --> 01:09:59,720
I have about 6 schools so far

1072
01:10:01,410 --> 01:10:02,820
Only 6

1073
01:10:04,760 --> 01:10:07,310
What is this, some kinda tasty water ??

1074
01:10:09,060 --> 01:10:11,430
You're left on your own, if you don't get this !

1075
01:10:15,240 --> 01:10:16,370
Yeah, he should be apprehended

1076
01:10:16,790 --> 01:10:18,480
As a true lunatic, yes

1077
01:10:23,890 --> 01:10:26,330
We know we laughed
We know...

1078
01:10:34,260 --> 01:10:37,970
We need to be more alert knowing these types of lunatics are around the city

1079
01:10:37,970 --> 01:10:40,530
But wait, aren't we in a police station ?

1080
01:10:41,990 --> 01:10:44,780
That first guy was a first-class-moron

1081
01:10:45,320 --> 01:10:46,900
He's my classmate...

1082
01:10:49,550 --> 01:10:52,100
Listen !
I'm getting tired of your poor attitude these days !

1083
01:10:53,140 --> 01:10:56,140
Why did you all skip yesterday's training ?

1084
01:10:56,350 --> 01:10:58,030
Why did you ?

1085
01:10:58,690 --> 01:10:59,570
I'm sorry

1086
01:10:59,900 --> 01:11:01,750
but a new game went on sale yesterday

1087
01:11:01,830 --> 01:11:02,590
and I had to get it

1088
01:11:02,590 --> 01:11:04,980
OK, then
Back to your training !!

1089
01:11:06,050 --> 01:11:06,920
And you ?

1090
01:11:06,960 --> 01:11:11,070
Riot Squad Trainee
Hitori Gekidan

1091
01:11:07,150 --> 01:11:09,160
I went on a day trip with my girlfriend

1092
01:11:09,760 --> 01:11:10,760
Back to training !

1093
01:11:15,010 --> 01:11:17,250
And you, what's your excuse ?!

1094
01:11:17,350 --> 01:11:20,650
I'm sorry but
my mother fell and I took her to the hospital

1095
01:11:22,910 --> 01:11:25,350
So what ??

1096
01:11:25,450 --> 01:11:27,680
My mother fell and I took her to the hospital

1097
01:11:27,850 --> 01:11:29,640
I don't care !!

1098
01:11:29,640 --> 01:11:30,560
But my mother fell...

1099
01:11:31,490 --> 01:11:32,180
My mother

1100
01:11:32,850 --> 01:11:33,450
My

1101
01:11:36,260 --> 01:11:37,860
Get up

1102
01:11:50,920 --> 01:11:52,180
Out of control !

1103
01:12:00,750 --> 01:12:02,430
I seriously feel bad for him

1104
01:12:02,850 --> 01:12:05,800
I've seen him in that exact situation before

1105
01:12:08,970 --> 01:12:11,050
Stay in here for a while

1106
01:12:11,780 --> 01:12:12,700
It's cold

1107
01:12:13,350 --> 01:12:14,280
It's cold in here

1108
01:12:14,920 --> 01:12:15,690
No kidding

1109
01:12:18,250 --> 01:12:20,200
Can I hit the restroom ?

1110
01:12:20,650 --> 01:12:21,590
I don't see why not

1111
01:12:22,480 --> 01:12:23,400
I'll be right back then

1112
01:12:30,910 --> 01:12:33,170
Being out in the cold made me wanna go pee

1113
01:12:33,630 --> 01:12:35,260
but if Yamasaki needs to take care of No.2

1114
01:12:35,760 --> 01:12:39,950
I feel obligated to stay here until he's back, you know ?

1115
01:12:42,650 --> 01:12:45,350
Can I have one, please ?

1116
01:12:44,850 --> 01:12:46,800
I thought they were supposed to be "props"

1117
01:12:51,440 --> 01:12:53,590
I guess they're yours now

1118
01:12:55,020 --> 01:12:56,600
Never seen bananas that small

1119
01:13:04,620 --> 01:13:06,920
Are they supposed to look like this ?

1120
01:13:07,960 --> 01:13:08,680
I'm not sure

1121
01:13:09,190 --> 01:13:12,300
They look too ripe to me

1122
01:13:13,380 --> 01:13:15,170
Too ripe ?

1123
01:13:15,200 --> 01:13:16,470
Why don't you try one, then ?

1124
01:13:16,600 --> 01:13:17,760
Would you like one, too ?

1125
01:13:17,730 --> 01:13:18,310
No thanks

1126
01:13:19,210 --> 01:13:22,200
Well, I'm not a big fan of bananas to begin with, so...

1127
01:13:22,660 --> 01:13:23,660
Put them down, then

1128
01:13:24,220 --> 01:13:25,940
But see, I already broke one off

1129
01:13:27,150 --> 01:13:28,220
Try a taste then

1130
01:13:29,000 --> 01:13:31,330
It'll satisfy your curiosity at least

1131
01:13:32,940 --> 01:13:33,860
My guess is

1132
01:13:33,860 --> 01:13:36,630
this is a good one

1133
01:13:40,950 --> 01:13:42,300
I told YOU to try it

1134
01:13:46,100 --> 01:13:47,910
Well, this one is like...

1135
01:13:48,940 --> 01:13:51,100
not a bad one

1136
01:13:51,140 --> 01:13:52,990
I know the skin looks kinda weird

1137
01:13:54,220 --> 01:13:57,140
Why don't YOU EAT IT, THEN ?!!

1138
01:14:00,070 --> 01:14:01,310
You're seriously playing dirty

1139
01:14:01,900 --> 01:14:04,130
No, I'm just saying I don't like bananas that much

1140
01:14:04,730 --> 01:14:06,030
Endo, you're playing unfairly

1141
01:14:10,070 --> 01:14:11,510
Why that face ?

1142
01:14:13,150 --> 01:14:15,050
As if you were feeling bad for him ??

1143
01:14:20,550 --> 01:14:22,080
Feel better ?

1144
01:14:23,000 --> 01:14:25,000
(My ass) hurt really bad though

1145
01:14:24,520 --> 01:14:25,230
Serious ?

1146
01:14:27,600 --> 01:14:29,080
It's from all the slapping, then ?

1147
01:14:28,850 --> 01:14:30,490
Yeah, I'm pretty sure

1148
01:14:30,950 --> 01:14:33,390
I had to really take my time in there

1149
01:14:41,450 --> 01:14:43,030
Still working on that ?

1150
01:14:43,700 --> 01:14:47,590
Yamasaki Struggles with Looping His Belt

1151
01:14:46,140 --> 01:14:47,390
This pissed me off as well

1152
01:14:48,340 --> 01:14:51,050
I'm afraid I need some help with this

1153
01:14:54,550 --> 01:14:55,850
He's not being fair

1154
01:15:04,530 --> 01:15:05,480
Help me !!

1155
01:15:06,080 --> 01:15:07,270
I can't do this !

1156
01:15:08,990 --> 01:15:12,650
Yama-chan, please get it together

1157
01:15:20,550 --> 01:15:22,410
It's been 4 hours since the start

1158
01:15:22,970 --> 01:15:25,720
Lunch time for the hungry group

1159
01:15:28,320 --> 01:15:29,420
I'll go ahead and pass these around

1160
01:15:31,850 --> 01:15:33,150
I'll get some tea for us

1161
01:15:34,060 --> 01:15:35,550
Does this mean it's noon ?

1162
01:15:40,900 --> 01:15:44,390
Gourmet Lunch Box

1163
01:15:42,330 --> 01:15:43,720
This is one luxurious lunch

1164
01:15:44,530 --> 01:15:46,640
Can I just go ahead and eat this ?

1165
01:15:47,750 --> 01:15:50,750
That's too good of a lunch for you guys

1166
01:15:51,260 --> 01:15:52,920
I don't recall getting lunch like that before

1167
01:15:53,370 --> 01:15:54,210
Sure ?

1168
01:15:54,990 --> 01:15:57,040
We thought there would be some kinda set-up with this lunch, but...

1169
01:15:57,460 --> 01:16:01,280
Hamada Carefully Inspects His Lunch

1170
01:16:00,910 --> 01:16:02,460
Do you see anything unusual ?

1171
01:16:03,000 --> 01:16:05,750
Ramen noodles was all we got when I was involved

1172
01:16:06,000 --> 01:16:07,060
Are you serious ?

1173
01:16:07,150 --> 01:16:08,150
I'm sure of it

1174
01:16:09,650 --> 01:16:10,910
Look at you !

1175
01:16:12,600 --> 01:16:13,620
What the hell are you eating ?

1176
01:16:16,130 --> 01:16:17,650
Disgusting

1177
01:16:19,440 --> 01:16:20,550
Wow, you were hungry

1178
01:16:21,350 --> 01:16:23,180
He sure is hungry, eating things he doesn't know

1179
01:16:24,320 --> 01:16:26,700
See any paper towels ?

1180
01:16:28,160 --> 01:16:31,040
You know, I don't see any around

1181
01:16:32,790 --> 01:16:34,350
Don't worry about it, then

1182
01:16:37,950 --> 01:16:39,420
Endo's up to no good, isn't he ?

1183
01:16:40,050 --> 01:16:41,250
How about this ?

1184
01:16:41,150 --> 01:16:44,880
Endo suggests piece of newspaper

1185
01:17:01,180 --> 01:17:02,840
You were such a jerk

1186
01:17:03,480 --> 01:17:05,380
I didn't know what got into me

1187
01:17:10,790 --> 01:17:12,460
I thought I was being nice

1188
01:17:13,320 --> 01:17:14,980
Endo's not done yet, wait and see

1189
01:17:15,520 --> 01:17:17,650
Hamada san, are you gonna eat that cookie ?

1190
01:17:18,350 --> 01:17:19,950
That round one

1191
01:17:22,300 --> 01:17:23,410
You done with it ?

1192
01:17:27,030 --> 01:17:27,690
Thanks

1193
01:17:27,260 --> 01:17:29,400
Why're you trying to bust me ??

1194
01:17:30,190 --> 01:17:32,930
He didn't need to specify the shape of cookie

1195
01:17:33,750 --> 01:17:35,700
Can I have that piece of cheese, please ?

1196
01:17:40,650 --> 01:17:42,250
You guys, I've just about had it up to here

1197
01:17:42,650 --> 01:17:44,150
I'm trying not to be wasteful

1198
01:17:50,570 --> 01:17:51,580
This cheese is delicious

1199
01:17:55,240 --> 01:17:56,820
I don't mind sharing

1200
01:17:56,950 --> 01:18:00,910
but don't come at me with that half-smile
and the full intention to bust me

1201
01:18:02,210 --> 01:18:04,190
Like "I'm gonna get him"

1202
01:18:04,040 --> 01:18:05,070
No more of that, then

1203
01:18:05,660 --> 01:18:07,560
Why are we busting each other out anyhow ?

1204
01:18:08,350 --> 01:18:10,350
We need something to clean our hands

1205
01:18:13,900 --> 01:18:14,840
Oh, thanks

1206
01:18:15,150 --> 01:18:17,950
He just leaves them there !

1207
01:18:22,420 --> 01:18:24,310
Endo obviously couldn't hold it in

1208
01:18:29,050 --> 01:18:30,600
Endo's the Bad Guy !!

1209
01:18:31,300 --> 01:18:33,190
Endo's the Bad Guy !!

1210
01:18:33,210 --> 01:18:36,380
I've got some balls treating Hamada-san like that

1211
01:18:40,860 --> 01:18:42,640
What is
What is this for ?

1212
01:18:43,180 --> 01:18:44,920
This....

1213
01:18:46,240 --> 01:18:47,230
I'm not sure

1214
01:18:47,940 --> 01:18:49,750
I see, it attaches to the pistol

1215
01:18:50,970 --> 01:18:53,210
It goes on here, see ?

1216
01:18:55,430 --> 01:18:57,170
Well, I can't get this on

1217
01:18:59,780 --> 01:19:02,260
Endo, why don't you hook this thing for me ?

1218
01:19:03,640 --> 01:19:05,550
You see this, huh ?

1219
01:19:05,750 --> 01:19:07,690
See, got that ?

1220
01:19:11,900 --> 01:19:12,950
That was very disrespectful

1221
01:19:16,250 --> 01:19:19,140
I'm not seeing a good senior-junior relationship

1222
01:19:19,750 --> 01:19:22,470
I'm sorry, Hamada-san
but my mind just went blank

1223
01:19:23,020 --> 01:19:24,320
Endo's the Bad Guy !!

1224
01:19:25,630 --> 01:19:28,770
And who the hell are you supposed to be, Yamasaki ?!

1225
01:19:28,750 --> 01:19:33,650
Is it time for a break after lunch ??

1226
01:19:36,530 --> 01:19:38,150
Emergency Order

1227
01:19:38,350 --> 01:19:47,450
Emergency Order

1228
01:19:41,850 --> 01:19:44,640
The station received a Bomb-scare

1229
01:19:44,850 --> 01:19:47,330
All officers are to report to the site immediately !!

1230
01:19:48,680 --> 01:19:51,840
There's been a bomb-scare, we need to report to the scene immediately

1231
01:19:53,740 --> 01:19:54,530
Let's go

1232
01:19:57,900 --> 01:20:02,600
An Emergency Surfaces
Report to the Bomb-Scare Scene at Once

1233
01:20:03,150 --> 01:20:06,180
The 3 jump in the patrol car and drive out to the scene

1234
01:20:06,810 --> 01:20:09,690
So they've set up a bomb way out here ?

1235
01:20:09,710 --> 01:20:13,390
What's the point of setting up a bomb this far out ?

1236
01:20:13,410 --> 01:20:15,860
It's pointless

1237
01:20:16,410 --> 01:20:17,520
Looks like we're here

1238
01:20:19,410 --> 01:20:20,260
Let's get out

1239
01:20:22,110 --> 01:20:24,870
The bomb is set up in that shack

1240
01:20:28,110 --> 01:20:29,170
Could that be...?

1241
01:20:29,310 --> 01:20:32,680
The helicopter is here

1242
01:20:31,610 --> 01:20:32,610
Is that it ?

1243
01:20:33,010 --> 01:20:36,600
What ?

1244
01:20:34,870 --> 01:20:36,600
They're here in a helicopter ?

1245
01:20:35,500 --> 01:20:36,600
Amazing

1246
01:20:36,710 --> 01:20:41,560
This magnitude of an incident calls for an expert from our headquarters

1247
01:20:41,870 --> 01:20:43,240
Cool

1248
01:20:48,850 --> 01:20:50,250
Pretty amazing

1249
01:20:52,010 --> 01:20:57,610
Arrival of the Top Dog from Headquarters

1250
01:21:00,500 --> 01:21:04,610
Top-Dog
Haruka Unabara

1251
01:21:14,840 --> 01:21:17,240
We have confirmed the bomb scare to be real

1252
01:21:17,510 --> 01:21:18,160
I see

1253
01:21:18,710 --> 01:21:20,130
What a BOLD(bald) move

1254
01:21:20,210 --> 01:21:22,110
They think they can get away with this ?

1255
01:21:22,120 --> 01:21:23,110
Any idea when it could go off ?

1256
01:21:23,260 --> 01:21:24,470
No idea, sir

1257
01:21:26,200 --> 01:21:27,910
Utterly BOLD (bald)!

1258
01:21:28,540 --> 01:21:29,480
Damn it !

1259
01:21:39,770 --> 01:21:41,430
I know, I know

1260
01:21:41,960 --> 01:21:42,870
What a production !

1261
01:21:43,460 --> 01:21:45,130
Did he need to show up in a helicopter ?

1262
01:21:52,230 --> 01:21:54,040
I see even the top-dog can't resolve this

1263
01:21:54,550 --> 01:21:56,160
Wait, he hasn't done anything yet

1264
01:21:58,940 --> 01:22:00,520
I don't get why he picked this song

1265
01:22:01,500 --> 01:22:02,470
Why this song ?

1266
01:22:04,450 --> 01:22:08,580
Oh, here comes our station's renowned bomb squad member

1267
01:22:09,030 --> 01:22:11,210
Bomb Squad
Itsuji Itao

1268
01:22:12,570 --> 01:22:13,300
It's just one guy ?

1269
01:22:32,840 --> 01:22:34,200
The song is still a mystery

1270
01:22:36,520 --> 01:22:38,580
I assume that's Itao's sense of humor

1271
01:22:40,630 --> 01:22:42,440
You're all in good hands now

1272
01:22:44,410 --> 01:22:45,820
I'd better get to work

1273
01:22:45,820 --> 01:22:46,610
Good luck

1274
01:22:50,110 --> 01:22:59,910
Only a hammer and a pair of scissors

1275
01:23:00,270 --> 01:23:01,700
Man, we're losing this battle

1276
01:23:11,040 --> 01:23:13,680
Please do not leave this perimeter

1277
01:23:16,380 --> 01:23:17,310
I guess he only needs the scissors

1278
01:23:19,050 --> 01:23:20,030
Why that song ?

1279
01:23:22,870 --> 01:23:23,980
He sure does take his time

1280
01:23:26,510 --> 01:23:27,910
He's determined to cut the wire I guess

1281
01:23:31,630 --> 01:23:33,090
Shouldn't he be acting with more urgency ?

1282
01:23:34,490 --> 01:23:36,440
I'm sure he's a bit nervous

1283
01:23:40,340 --> 01:23:44,130
I'm inside the shack, over ?

1284
01:23:45,490 --> 01:23:47,840
Confirmed
Take every precaution, over ?

1285
01:23:48,880 --> 01:23:49,650
Confirmed

1286
01:23:51,470 --> 01:23:55,610
I have just found the suspected object, over ?

1287
01:23:56,560 --> 01:23:59,030
Confirmed
Proceed with caution, over ?

1288
01:24:00,170 --> 01:24:01,170
Confirmed

1289
01:24:02,410 --> 01:24:06,050
I am about to attempt to diffuse the object, over ?

1290
01:24:38,620 --> 01:24:40,670
That scared the hell outta me !

1291
01:24:41,230 --> 01:24:43,570
The guy from headquarters was flipping out, too

1292
01:24:49,380 --> 01:24:50,660
Incredible

1293
01:24:51,850 --> 01:24:53,080
Amazing explosion

1294
01:24:57,110 --> 01:24:58,780
That was something !

1295
01:24:59,640 --> 01:25:01,160
What happened to the bomb squad member ?

1296
01:25:01,840 --> 01:25:02,610
Shall we go ?

1297
01:25:02,950 --> 01:25:03,400
What ?

1298
01:25:05,010 --> 01:25:05,980
Yes, it was quite an incident

1299
01:25:06,790 --> 01:25:08,310
But a great lesson has been learned

1300
01:25:08,480 --> 01:25:09,410
Let's go

1301
01:25:12,570 --> 01:25:13,350
C'mon everyone

1302
01:25:13,610 --> 01:25:14,600
What about the bomb guy ?

1303
01:25:15,430 --> 01:25:16,470
Indeed, that was something else

1304
01:25:16,850 --> 01:25:18,050
Can't you say anything else ?

1305
01:25:19,140 --> 01:25:22,440
The 3 return to the station

1306
01:25:24,720 --> 01:25:25,840
What the hell are you doing ?

1307
01:25:25,410 --> 01:25:29,510
Endo Takes Care of His Dry Skin

1308
01:25:27,540 --> 01:25:28,830
It was really dry that day

1309
01:25:30,910 --> 01:25:33,330
You must be super sensitive
Does it hurt ?

1310
01:25:32,840 --> 01:25:33,330
Yes

1311
01:25:34,710 --> 01:25:38,440
You know, my skin is starting to feel dry and itchy, too

1312
01:25:42,360 --> 01:25:48,760
One of the day's masterminds, Tanaka, arrives at the scene

1313
01:25:47,220 --> 01:25:48,390
I guess I made it

1314
01:25:50,370 --> 01:25:53,360
Shakure Police Station...

1315
01:25:53,840 --> 01:25:54,980
I must confess

1316
01:25:55,210 --> 01:25:57,760
I couldn't wipe the smirk off my face since last night

1317
01:26:00,500 --> 01:26:05,570
The other mastermind of the day, Matsumoto, arrives

1318
01:26:06,810 --> 01:26:11,610
Operation Headquarters

1319
01:26:08,820 --> 01:26:10,190
Good morning

1320
01:26:11,880 --> 01:26:13,440
Check out how many cameras they have !

1321
01:26:16,520 --> 01:26:19,230
Hamada san seems to have received the most (batsu) so far

1322
01:26:21,520 --> 01:26:23,740
He still seems to be in good spirits though

1323
01:26:23,980 --> 01:26:29,670
With the arrival of these two men, the game will surely escalate !!

1324
01:26:35,490 --> 01:26:37,830
One of the top narcotic officers will be

1325
01:26:38,390 --> 01:26:41,340
discussing drug search techniques with you guys

1326
01:26:42,090 --> 01:26:43,080
Shall we ?

1327
01:26:49,510 --> 01:26:50,070
This way

1328
01:26:52,250 --> 01:26:53,690
Endo, you sit at the very end

1329
01:26:54,070 --> 01:26:54,660
Hamada,

1330
01:26:55,240 --> 01:26:55,960
and Yamasaki

1331
01:26:57,380 --> 01:27:01,610
Narcotics Officer
Hosshan

1332
01:27:00,600 --> 01:27:02,920
He's starting to look very distinguished

1333
01:27:03,440 --> 01:27:04,890
I'm Hosshan, a Narcotics officer

1334
01:27:06,130 --> 01:27:10,100
The frequency of drug smuggling has been rampant these days !

1335
01:27:12,200 --> 01:27:14,110
And it's only gonna get worse !

1336
01:27:14,670 --> 01:27:15,530
So today,

1337
01:27:16,080 --> 01:27:19,830
I will be going over things to look for during a drug search

1338
01:27:17,820 --> 01:27:22,050
Lecture
Ways to Find Smuggled Drugs

1339
01:27:21,040 --> 01:27:22,140
What we've got here is

1340
01:27:22,640 --> 01:27:24,000
an ordinary suitcase

1341
01:27:24,430 --> 01:27:26,210
Nothing unusual for traveling

1342
01:27:29,430 --> 01:27:36,170
Example
Wallet

1343
01:27:32,340 --> 01:27:34,350
You can definitely find something here

1344
01:27:34,870 --> 01:27:35,840
Don't overlook anything

1345
01:27:37,410 --> 01:27:38,580
See this ?!

1346
01:27:39,080 --> 01:27:43,610
Package of White Powder

1347
01:27:41,770 --> 01:27:43,310
No doubt, it's a drug

1348
01:27:45,420 --> 01:27:46,930
No doubt

1349
01:27:47,760 --> 01:27:49,420
But this is way too easy

1350
01:27:49,880 --> 01:27:51,380
Nobody hides it in their wallets anymore

1351
01:27:53,670 --> 01:27:54,710
How about this camera ?

1352
01:27:55,190 --> 01:27:59,210
Case 1
Camera

1353
01:28:01,620 --> 01:28:03,340
No doubt !

1354
01:28:03,350 --> 01:28:05,350
They hide it where the memory card goes

1355
01:28:06,290 --> 01:28:09,560
They think we won't look there, I guess

1356
01:28:10,590 --> 01:28:15,610
For an unknown reason, he found an Udon noodle

1357
01:28:13,510 --> 01:28:15,710
Let me just make sure

1358
01:28:25,590 --> 01:28:27,650
This is annoying

1359
01:28:48,420 --> 01:28:50,560
He's got full-control of the noodle !

1360
01:28:51,610 --> 01:28:52,810
Yes, he does

1361
01:28:54,500 --> 01:28:55,770
It's like magic

1362
01:29:03,660 --> 01:29:04,900
Go ahead and sit

1363
01:29:11,270 --> 01:29:13,150
No doubt, this is a Udon noodle

1364
01:29:14,600 --> 01:29:15,390
It's not a drug

1365
01:29:15,770 --> 01:29:16,980
It happens sometimes

1366
01:29:17,660 --> 01:29:18,800
How about this, then ?

1367
01:29:19,580 --> 01:29:23,610
Case 2
Instant Coffee

1368
01:29:20,450 --> 01:29:22,360
They've gone to Brazil or somewhere for this ?

1369
01:29:23,990 --> 01:29:25,440
It's just instant coffee, isn't it ?

1370
01:29:30,960 --> 01:29:34,550
Another package of Udon noodles

1371
01:29:31,170 --> 01:29:32,260
See ?

1372
01:29:41,100 --> 01:29:45,490
It's well marinated in coffee

1373
01:29:48,160 --> 01:29:51,790
Very well marinated in coffee !

1374
01:29:52,940 --> 01:29:55,620
I haven't heard anyone use that term in a while

1375
01:30:01,760 --> 01:30:06,760
Translation by Shibatabread

1376
01:30:02,290 --> 01:30:04,720
Don't assume this is just a cute stuffed animal

1377
01:30:02,730 --> 01:30:05,640
Case 3
Stuffed Bear

1378
01:30:04,860 --> 01:30:05,640
Is this for your kids ?

1379
01:30:11,000 --> 01:30:12,880
What did I tell you ?!

1380
01:30:13,630 --> 01:30:18,960
Once Again, An Udon Noodle

1381
01:30:13,710 --> 01:30:16,200
They'll try anything, see ?

1382
01:30:16,750 --> 01:30:18,240
It's a desperate attempt !

1383
01:30:24,050 --> 01:30:26,690
Where did it (noodle) go ?

1384
01:30:31,940 --> 01:30:33,730
I'd laugh at that, too

1385
01:30:34,550 --> 01:30:36,230
Where did it go anyway ?

1386
01:30:37,030 --> 01:30:40,070
There's just too many noodles !

1387
01:30:43,270 --> 01:30:46,070
One third of the day has passed

1388
01:30:47,080 --> 01:30:50,240
They have already endured many hard batsu's so far

1389
01:30:50,240 --> 01:30:54,470
Signs of fatigue begin to appear

1390
01:30:54,470 --> 01:30:58,580
Matsumoto and Tanaka orchestrate the next move from headquarters

1391
01:30:58,590 --> 01:31:01,720
luring the 3 men into a laughing hell !!

1392
01:31:05,290 --> 01:31:09,070
I'll be playing a video which shows you

1393
01:31:09,120 --> 01:31:12,480
how to be an effective officer

1394
01:31:13,940 --> 01:31:17,250
Watching these videos is my weakness

1395
01:31:14,510 --> 01:31:20,760
Study Time
Learn the be an Effective Police Officer

1396
01:31:18,130 --> 01:31:20,560
Hope I can make it through this

1397
01:31:20,770 --> 01:31:25,730
Shakure Station Job Descriptions

1398
01:31:26,060 --> 01:31:29,110
Let me explain how some of the officers

1399
01:31:29,130 --> 01:31:31,320
work to make everyone safe

1400
01:31:32,580 --> 01:31:40,390
Motorcycle Team

1401
01:31:32,600 --> 01:31:36,350
A group that children admire

1402
01:31:40,820 --> 01:31:45,830
A trainer teaches K9 dogs to assist officers

1403
01:31:41,390 --> 01:31:51,760
K9 Dog Training

1404
01:31:51,810 --> 01:31:54,480
Starting this winter

1405
01:31:54,960 --> 01:31:56,630
we have implemented a new department called

1406
01:31:57,030 --> 01:31:58,430
The Safe Living Department

1407
01:31:58,760 --> 01:32:02,150
Here, citizens can call for help with their financial,

1408
01:32:02,650 --> 01:32:06,060
domestic, or juvenile crime issues at their homes

1409
01:32:06,080 --> 01:32:09,050
Citizens are free to call our hotline anytime

1410
01:32:09,080 --> 01:32:13,400
Let's see how they work

1411
01:32:14,430 --> 01:32:17,700
Here's Officer Hirano

1412
01:32:18,200 --> 01:32:24,580
And Officer Jimmy Onishi

1413
01:32:26,360 --> 01:32:27,440
Hello, this is Shakure Po...

1414
01:32:27,490 --> 01:32:29,400
Cough, Cough

1415
01:32:29,440 --> 01:32:33,660
My good friend is suffering from D.V.(domestic violence) at home

1416
01:32:33,660 --> 01:32:33,970
What ?

1417
01:32:36,660 --> 01:32:43,060
Inquiry from a wife
about D.V.

1418
01:32:39,160 --> 01:32:40,550
Yes, this is about D.V.

1419
01:32:40,600 --> 01:32:42,480
So you've got a case of D.V. ?

1420
01:32:47,740 --> 01:32:49,340
This isn't good !

1421
01:32:50,260 --> 01:32:50,970
Not good

1422
01:32:51,320 --> 01:32:53,320
So far, I'm OK

1423
01:32:56,170 --> 01:32:59,210
He has no idea what she's asking

1424
01:32:58,490 --> 01:32:59,140
No idea

1425
01:32:59,260 --> 01:33:00,780
A bad case of D.V. ?

1426
01:33:01,980 --> 01:33:04,690
Oh boy

1427
01:33:04,730 --> 01:33:05,630
Well...

1428
01:33:06,370 --> 01:33:07,160
Well...

1429
01:33:08,200 --> 01:33:09,650
Does it involve watching

1430
01:33:09,780 --> 01:33:13,380
too many videos with someone ?

1431
01:33:15,860 --> 01:33:17,460
Impossible

1432
01:33:23,520 --> 01:33:25,500
No, I'm asking about D.V.

1433
01:33:26,160 --> 01:33:28,280
So is this a...

1434
01:33:31,550 --> 01:33:33,780
Does this involve a camera of some sort ?

1435
01:33:33,820 --> 01:33:36,410
You don't know what D.V. is ?

1436
01:33:36,440 --> 01:33:37,680
Well

1437
01:33:38,010 --> 01:33:39,660
I'm sorry to tell you

1438
01:33:39,680 --> 01:33:41,390
that I'm not very educated in that department

1439
01:33:41,460 --> 01:33:46,080
So, the answer is no

1440
01:33:48,290 --> 01:33:50,230
He gets you guys every time

1441
01:33:50,430 --> 01:33:51,800
Of course, he got us !

1442
01:33:52,460 --> 01:33:54,440
What's with the way he talks ?

1443
01:33:54,500 --> 01:33:55,590
This isn't cool

1444
01:33:57,390 --> 01:33:59,420
I can't concentrate !

1445
01:34:02,780 --> 01:34:04,100
Well...

1446
01:34:04,290 --> 01:34:06,400
I'm sorry to tell you

1447
01:34:06,430 --> 01:34:07,770
that I'm not very educated in that department

1448
01:34:07,800 --> 01:34:10,230
So, the answer is no

1449
01:34:16,430 --> 01:34:18,270
Why do they have to replay that ?

1450
01:34:24,110 --> 01:34:25,150
I'm sorry to tell you

1451
01:34:25,220 --> 01:34:26,880
that I'm not educated in that department

1452
01:34:26,880 --> 01:34:27,770
So, the answer is no

1453
01:34:28,670 --> 01:34:30,270
Are you a police officer ?

1454
01:34:30,290 --> 01:34:31,750
Well...

1455
01:34:33,440 --> 01:34:35,180
I'm sorry to tell you

1456
01:34:35,240 --> 01:34:39,730
that I'm totally ignorant when it come to anything new

1457
01:34:45,210 --> 01:34:46,790
I can't make it

1458
01:34:49,940 --> 01:34:52,040
So you don't know what D.V. is ?

1459
01:34:53,900 --> 01:34:55,300
Let me see...

1460
01:34:55,520 --> 01:34:56,760
Well...

1461
01:34:57,710 --> 01:35:01,600
Is this an Old-Age Pension Plan ?

1462
01:35:06,810 --> 01:35:08,690
I don't understand him

1463
01:35:09,760 --> 01:35:11,780
Why "old age" ?

1464
01:35:15,650 --> 01:35:16,700
Let me see...

1465
01:35:16,730 --> 01:35:18,010
Well..

1466
01:35:19,030 --> 01:35:22,400
Is this an Old-age pension plan ?

1467
01:35:23,170 --> 01:35:24,860
A pension ?

1468
01:35:25,110 --> 01:35:26,260
Well...

1469
01:35:27,020 --> 01:35:30,800
Is this an employee's pension plan, then ?

1470
01:35:36,690 --> 01:35:38,070
I've just about had enough

1471
01:35:38,250 --> 01:35:39,900
And so has my ass

1472
01:35:43,630 --> 01:35:48,120
Do you know what D.V. stands for ?

1473
01:35:48,480 --> 01:35:49,690
Well..

1474
01:35:49,710 --> 01:35:51,070
It stands for

1475
01:35:51,110 --> 01:35:51,860
"Don't mind"

1476
01:35:54,360 --> 01:35:54,980
"Don't mind"

1477
01:35:58,140 --> 01:35:59,250
"Don't mind"

1478
01:36:01,950 --> 01:36:02,870
"Don't mind"

1479
01:36:02,880 --> 01:36:06,760
"Don't mind"

1480
01:36:12,360 --> 01:36:15,830
I can't take this anymore

1481
01:36:19,350 --> 01:36:22,100
I'm seriously ready to cry

1482
01:36:23,760 --> 01:36:24,840
"Don't mind"

1483
01:36:26,920 --> 01:36:28,120
"Don't mind"

1484
01:36:28,150 --> 01:36:29,290
"Don't mind"

1485
01:36:30,280 --> 01:36:31,490
Va...

1486
01:36:31,510 --> 01:36:34,150
"Vatican"

1487
01:36:39,780 --> 01:36:41,130
Is he serious ?

1488
01:36:41,140 --> 01:36:42,490
Why Vatican ?

1489
01:36:46,130 --> 01:36:48,250
He took a long time to come up with that ?

1490
01:36:49,410 --> 01:36:50,740
This was hard

1491
01:36:52,110 --> 01:36:55,200
What the hell is "Don't mind, Vatican" ??

1492
01:36:57,090 --> 01:36:58,040
"Don't mind"

1493
01:36:58,060 --> 01:36:59,640
"Don't mind"

1494
01:37:00,420 --> 01:37:01,460
Va...

1495
01:37:01,510 --> 01:37:05,170
"Vatican"

1496
01:37:06,300 --> 01:37:07,200
Oh wait, it's actually

1497
01:37:07,230 --> 01:37:10,750
"Don't mind BAKATARE (idiot)"

1498
01:37:16,420 --> 01:37:18,040
This guy's really irritating

1499
01:37:22,620 --> 01:37:23,680
That hurts

1500
01:37:24,280 --> 01:37:26,760
It's utterly meaningless

1501
01:37:29,900 --> 01:37:32,310
The night sets in

1502
01:37:35,360 --> 01:37:36,360
Just so you know

1503
01:37:36,690 --> 01:37:40,110
we have some talented interrogators

1504
01:37:40,270 --> 01:37:41,950
at this station

1505
01:37:41,950 --> 01:37:45,900
And why not learn some techniques

1506
01:37:45,910 --> 01:37:47,650
from these professionals ?

1507
01:37:47,920 --> 01:37:49,810
Let's move to the interrogation room

1508
01:37:52,800 --> 01:37:54,800
Interrogation techniques...

Interrogation Techniques From A to Z

1510
01:38:02,500 --> 01:38:03,840
Come this way

1511
01:38:07,320 --> 01:38:10,850
You're looking through a two-way mirror

1512
01:38:11,410 --> 01:38:13,580
and obviously, they can't see you

1513
01:38:13,730 --> 01:38:15,370
Check this out

1514
01:38:15,400 --> 01:38:17,010
There's one suspect

1515
01:38:17,380 --> 01:38:19,020
He's been stubborn

1516
01:38:19,280 --> 01:38:20,960
and won't budge

1517
01:38:23,780 --> 01:38:24,980
Oh good, he's here

1518
01:38:25,050 --> 01:38:27,250
He's known to break any criminal's silence

1519
01:38:28,560 --> 01:38:35,000
Interrogator
Shoji Murakami

1520
01:38:32,440 --> 01:38:34,300
I've got a bad feeling about this

1521
01:38:35,300 --> 01:38:37,160
He's got that presence

1522
01:38:37,180 --> 01:38:39,390
He radiates an aura

1523
01:38:40,410 --> 01:38:41,750
Your hobby is

1524
01:38:42,950 --> 01:38:44,050
to travel

1525
01:38:45,440 --> 01:38:47,230
You just came back from Izu ??

1526
01:38:48,160 --> 01:38:49,840
How is this funny, you idiot ?

1527
01:38:50,940 --> 01:38:52,300
Why not talk, huh ?

1528
01:38:53,680 --> 01:38:55,770
Larva         Flea    and lice, you moron !

1529
01:38:55,770 --> 01:38:58,670
Larva         Flea    and lice, you moron !

1530
01:38:58,670 --> 01:39:00,390
Larva         Flea    and lice, you moron !

1531
01:39:02,110 --> 01:39:03,910
INGROWN NAIL     ingrown nail

1532
01:39:03,910 --> 01:39:05,300
INGROWN NAIL     ingrown nail

Why say it twice ?

1536
01:39:12,400 --> 01:39:12,970
Cartilage...Oops, that wasn't it

1537
01:39:12,970 --> 01:39:14,810
Cartilage...Oops, that wasn't it

1538
01:39:18,180 --> 01:39:20,480
I see you're disadvantaged already

1539
01:39:36,300 --> 01:39:38,450
We both know what you did

1540
01:39:40,090 --> 01:39:42,970
The Cartilage, you moron!

1541
01:39:43,620 --> 01:39:44,460
RINGING IN AN EAR     ringing in an ear

1542
01:39:44,460 --> 01:39:46,680
RINGING IN AN EAR     ringing in an ear

1543
01:39:47,370 --> 01:39:48,680
I don't get this

1544
01:39:48,900 --> 01:39:50,450
LONG DISTANT RELATIONSHIP

1545
01:39:53,990 --> 01:39:56,390
This really gets to Yamasaki

1546
01:39:56,400 --> 01:39:57,390
I couldn't handle this

1547
01:40:00,270 --> 01:40:02,910
I don't understand what he means

1548
01:40:02,440 --> 01:40:04,810
You can't think too much into it

1549
01:40:11,870 --> 01:40:13,930
Wow, look at all those props

1550
01:40:14,010 --> 01:40:15,790
I see they edited the hell out of this

1551
01:40:17,650 --> 01:40:20,210
Yea, this was easily 30 minutes plus

1552
01:40:19,250 --> 01:40:21,420
You know I used be married with kids

1553
01:40:20,840 --> 01:40:22,440
This was long

1554
01:40:24,850 --> 01:40:25,750
But we're not together anymore

1555
01:40:27,760 --> 01:40:31,010
You can leave your family but there are some things you can never part with

1556
01:40:34,380 --> 01:40:37,580
And this long coat is exactly that

1557
01:40:37,880 --> 01:40:39,880
My favorite coat

1558
01:40:42,600 --> 01:40:44,360
He loves that thing

1559
01:40:44,630 --> 01:40:47,980
This is indeed...

1560
01:40:55,450 --> 01:40:58,230
I see, you decided to escort yourself out at this point

1561
01:41:05,630 --> 01:41:07,780
It's been hard

1562
01:41:12,080 --> 01:41:15,920
My manager was chatting with a woman at a party one night

1563
01:41:16,550 --> 01:41:20,110
And he was asked
"You work for Yoshimoto Entertainment ?"

1564
01:41:23,010 --> 01:41:26,380
"Who are you managing ?"

1565
01:41:26,510 --> 01:41:29,370
And he said to her, "I manage Shoji Murakami"

1566
01:41:29,780 --> 01:41:32,400
She replied, "He has a manager ??"

1567
01:41:51,870 --> 01:41:53,120
OK, I've had enough

1568
01:41:53,850 --> 01:41:55,390
I'll be back

1569
01:42:09,270 --> 01:42:10,400
That was fantastic

1570
01:42:10,420 --> 01:42:11,580
What? He didn't get him to talk ?!

1571
01:42:11,640 --> 01:42:13,400
He didn't come clean at all

1572
01:42:13,440 --> 01:42:15,920
Just wait, there's another one coming in

1573
01:42:20,600 --> 01:42:21,850
There he is

1574
01:42:23,180 --> 01:42:27,680
Interrogator
Koichi Wajima

1575
01:42:31,130 --> 01:42:35,380
PUSH

1576
01:42:39,930 --> 01:42:42,180
It clearly says to PUSH !

1577
01:42:50,110 --> 01:42:52,710
I'm expecting multiple butt-slaps here

1578
01:42:55,080 --> 01:42:57,880
Is he aware this is supposed to be a two-way mirror ?

1579
01:42:58,280 --> 01:42:59,180
Um, should I, should I, come back in one more time ?

1580
01:42:59,180 --> 01:42:59,840
Um, should I, should I, come back in one more time ?

1581
01:42:59,840 --> 01:43:00,880
Um, should I, should I, come back in one more time ?

1582
01:43:00,880 --> 01:43:01,880
Um, should I, should I, come back in one more time ?

1583
01:43:02,370 --> 01:43:03,330
No ?

1584
01:43:09,970 --> 01:43:11,910
What is this guy here for ?

1585
01:43:20,090 --> 01:43:21,400
What did you do ?

1586
01:43:22,400 --> 01:43:24,360
Why don't you talk ?

1587
01:43:29,420 --> 01:43:30,360
I did everything

1588
01:43:30,400 --> 01:43:31,440
I'm sorry

1589
01:43:31,880 --> 01:43:36,380
Criminal Easily Confesses

1590
01:43:36,290 --> 01:43:37,060
How ?

1591
01:43:37,080 --> 01:43:38,390
How did this happen ?

1592
01:43:38,680 --> 01:43:40,230
How did he get him to talk ?

1593
01:43:40,380 --> 01:43:42,380
I don't know
I It happened so fast

1594
01:43:46,180 --> 01:43:48,680
What kind of technique did he use ?

1595
01:43:50,190 --> 01:43:51,400
Nicely done

1596
01:43:52,380 --> 01:43:54,380
Um...

1597
01:43:52,380 --> 01:43:54,380
Um...

1598
01:43:52,380 --> 01:43:54,380
Um...

1599
01:43:56,280 --> 01:43:57,980
After the interrogation training

1600
01:43:58,460 --> 01:44:00,720
they move into another room

1601
01:44:03,890 --> 01:44:07,150
What else is waiting for them ?

1602
01:44:09,440 --> 01:44:12,240
Here we have an eyewitness of a recent crime

1603
01:44:12,280 --> 01:44:15,220
who can possibly identify the suspect

1604
01:44:12,730 --> 01:44:18,470
Eyewitness
How to Identify A Suspect

1605
01:44:15,260 --> 01:44:17,350
among the line up we have here

1606
01:44:17,390 --> 01:44:19,380
Will they be showing us photos to compare or something ?

1607
01:44:21,360 --> 01:44:23,160
We have one of the suspects behind this mirror,

1608
01:44:23,170 --> 01:44:26,230
Let me know if he's the one you saw

1609
01:44:29,450 --> 01:44:31,380
Suspect
Tatsuo Umemiya

1610
01:44:34,880 --> 01:44:37,410
You gotta be kiddin' !!

1611
01:44:37,480 --> 01:44:39,500
This isn't OK

1612
01:44:47,050 --> 01:44:49,010
Was he the one?

1613
01:44:49,070 --> 01:44:51,930
I recall he had his hair tied

1614
01:44:55,020 --> 01:44:57,020
Is this him ?

1615
01:44:58,130 --> 01:45:01,400
Close, but he had big set of teeth

1616
01:45:02,980 --> 01:45:03,580
Please stop

1617
01:45:04,400 --> 01:45:06,670
No more, please

1618
01:45:04,980 --> 01:45:06,880
I think he glanced at us

1619
01:45:14,730 --> 01:45:16,580
This is impossible

1620
01:45:18,450 --> 01:45:22,130
Absolutely impossible !

1621
01:45:31,980 --> 01:45:33,780
Was that him ?

1622
01:45:34,610 --> 01:45:38,280
Well, I think his hair was fuller

1623
01:45:38,230 --> 01:45:40,020
Seriously, who cares ?

1624
01:45:40,030 --> 01:45:41,730
Why bother with full hair or not ?

1625
01:45:49,110 --> 01:45:50,990
Is this him ?

1626
01:45:51,030 --> 01:45:54,660
He was more like *Gaki Daisho

1627
01:45:54,660 --> 01:45:57,650
*Gaki Daisho is the main character of a famous TV series in Japan

1628
01:46:00,300 --> 01:46:01,910
What's with that face ?

1629
01:46:03,170 --> 01:46:05,850
Is this him ?

1630
01:46:05,870 --> 01:46:07,370
I just remembered

1631
01:46:07,370 --> 01:46:11,900
He looked more like a Hong Kong movie star

1632
01:46:13,910 --> 01:46:15,830
I didn't realize he had such slim legs

1633
01:46:18,700 --> 01:46:21,880
Will you please not say anything like that ?

1634
01:46:31,140 --> 01:46:33,740
He would just about put on anything they ask him to

1635
01:46:40,900 --> 01:46:43,860
It's been already 10 hours

1636
01:46:58,940 --> 01:47:00,150

Wow, it's 7pm

1641
01:47:14,770 --> 01:47:17,230
Could you guys come with me ?

1642
01:47:18,710 --> 01:47:19,730
Just come with me ?

1643
01:47:19,780 --> 01:47:21,280
What's going on ?

1644
01:47:21,840 --> 01:47:22,910
Just come

1645
01:47:24,430 --> 01:47:26,230
We did a lot, didn't we ?

1646
01:47:29,890 --> 01:47:30,700
Oh !

1647
01:47:30,720 --> 01:47:32,930
Now I remember this !

1648
01:47:40,420 --> 01:47:45,890
Let us pay our last respects to Officer Itao, who left us too soon

He lost his life on duty
Funeral for Officer Itao

1650
01:47:52,310 --> 01:47:57,740
I would like to begin the funeral for Officer Itao

1651
01:47:58,930 --> 01:48:02,690
by asking his friends to speak about him

1652
01:48:02,740 --> 01:48:07,270
Itao's Friend
Officer Saito (Heipo)

1653
01:48:03,600 --> 01:48:04,740
Dear Officer Itao,

1654
01:48:05,410 --> 01:48:08,880
This is officer Saito thanking you for all you did for me

1655
01:48:09,160 --> 01:48:14,810
As a fellow member of the Bomb...

1656
01:48:21,260 --> 01:48:23,540
You both held your own there

1657
01:48:32,790 --> 01:48:35,900
Please pay your final respects to the deceased

1658
01:48:44,610 --> 01:48:45,890
He's alive !

1659
01:48:56,070 --> 01:48:57,050
How's he alive ?

1660
01:49:01,840 --> 01:49:02,420
He's alive ?

1661
01:49:03,890 --> 01:49:05,910
He insisted that he's alive

1662
01:49:09,390 --> 01:49:12,290
As for the 3 officers in front,

1663
01:49:12,290 --> 01:49:14,890
please come forward to pay your final respects

1664
01:49:51,590 --> 01:49:56,600
We discovered in Officer Itao's will

1665
01:49:56,880 --> 01:50:03,490
a farewell message for Mr. Masatoshi Hamada

1666
01:50:09,190 --> 01:50:10,890
Hama-yan...

1667
01:50:11,570 --> 01:50:14,110
Do you know who was always willing to help me,

1668
01:50:14,770 --> 01:50:16,650
when I was struggling with my life ?

1669
01:50:17,480 --> 01:50:20,140
It was none other than you, Hama-yan

1670
01:50:20,140 --> 01:50:23,340
It was none other than you, Hama-yan

1671
01:50:25,070 --> 01:50:27,820
You were someone I looked up to

1672
01:50:28,410 --> 01:50:30,460
even before I became an officer

1673
01:50:31,110 --> 01:50:32,590
And even after I completed my training

1674
01:50:33,190 --> 01:50:36,140
I always held you way above
anyone's pedestal, Hama-yan

1675
01:50:36,140 --> 01:50:38,740
I always held you way above
anyone's pedestal, Hama-yan

1676
01:50:38,100 --> 01:50:39,330
What's with Hama-yan ?

1677
01:50:40,460 --> 01:50:41,820
Then one day you said

1678
01:50:42,490 --> 01:50:44,420
Take your time, there's no need to hurry

1679
01:50:44,870 --> 01:50:48,410
I see that you're very talented

1680
01:50:50,040 --> 01:50:54,440
I couldn't hold my tears back

1681
01:50:54,930 --> 01:50:55,840
And you, Hama-yan,

1682
01:50:56,340 --> 01:50:59,340
couldn't hold your tears back either

1683
01:50:57,890 --> 01:50:59,220
What the...?

1684
01:50:59,890 --> 01:51:02,740
The kind words you said to me that day

1685
01:51:02,740 --> 01:51:10,090
made it easier to accept whatever fate had in store for me

1686
01:51:10,300 --> 01:51:11,890
Because of Hama-yan, I existed

1687
01:51:11,890 --> 01:51:14,300
Because of Hama-yan, I existed

1688
01:51:20,380 --> 01:51:22,280
Who the hell is Hama-yan ?

1689
01:51:32,720 --> 01:51:37,290
On that note, we will conclude the funeral

1690
01:51:39,090 --> 01:51:41,100
with this song,

1691
01:51:41,560 --> 01:51:45,050
requested by Officer Itao himself

1692
01:51:55,330 --> 01:51:59,300
Itao's wife

1693
01:52:16,160 --> 01:52:17,300
She put on some weight

1694
01:53:56,170 --> 01:53:57,330
My ass hurts

1695
01:54:05,670 --> 01:54:07,340
Thank you for waiting

1696
01:54:09,890 --> 01:54:12,880
I've brought your ramen and fried rice

1697
01:54:13,060 --> 01:54:15,890
Chinese food delivery
Nobuto Okamoto

1698
01:54:21,170 --> 01:54:22,250
What a surprise cameo !

1699
01:54:25,810 --> 01:54:28,120
I need to take those dishes back,

1700
01:54:28,760 --> 01:54:31,510
so I'm going to stay here until you're all done

1701
01:54:40,360 --> 01:54:41,490
I wouldn't like this

1702
01:54:50,540 --> 01:54:51,490
I wouldn't like it

1703
01:54:57,810 --> 01:54:59,520
Let's finish this really quick

1704
01:55:11,630 --> 01:55:13,270
Imagine having to eat so fast

1705
01:55:14,910 --> 01:55:16,580
He never changed his face the whole time

1706
01:55:23,750 --> 01:55:29,690
Text Message Received

1707
01:56:04,830 --> 01:56:06,530
I'll come back for those later

1708
01:56:08,340 --> 01:56:12,190
Damn you

1709
01:56:14,500 --> 01:56:15,870
Amazing

1710
01:56:16,250 --> 01:56:17,590
Amazing

1711
01:56:29,890 --> 01:56:33,150
Kin-chan Family announcing the 8pm hour

1712
01:56:30,050 --> 01:56:38,690
Kin-chan Family

1713
01:56:50,330 --> 01:56:51,630
If not Chiaki, it's them

1714
01:56:52,170 --> 01:56:55,200
Them laughing at the end made me laugh

1715
01:56:57,050 --> 01:56:58,450
My back hurts

1716
01:57:03,330 --> 01:57:06,380
A Mysterious duo stands-by in the hall

1717
01:57:06,960 --> 01:57:08,890
Who exactly are they ?

1718
01:57:15,180 --> 01:57:17,570
Our top senior officers are here to greet you

1719
01:57:18,240 --> 01:57:21,960
Who comes to mind when you hear "famous detective" ??

1720
01:57:22,840 --> 01:57:23,470
What ?

1721
01:57:23,940 --> 01:57:24,970
Who could that be ??

1722
01:57:25,930 --> 01:57:27,090
Detective Colombo ?

1723
01:57:27,390 --> 01:57:27,920
That's right

1724
01:57:29,580 --> 01:57:30,670
Yes, yes, yes, yes, NO

1725
01:57:30,680 --> 01:57:32,110
The jeans !

1726
01:57:32,220 --> 01:57:35,120
We have "W-Jeans" here at the station !

1727
01:57:35,680 --> 01:57:40,580
"Bark at the Sun" theme song

1728
01:57:41,560 --> 01:57:46,780
Here comes the W-Jeans

1729
01:57:52,260 --> 01:57:53,350
What ? What ? What ?

1730
01:57:53,350 --> 01:57:54,850
What the hell is that ?

1731
01:57:55,070 --> 01:57:58,740
It's nothing more than a green and yellow handkerchief

1732
01:57:59,660 --> 01:58:01,010
What the hell are you doing with it ?

1733
01:58:02,310 --> 01:58:06,780
WTF !!??

1734
01:58:22,260 --> 01:58:24,200
Hey, what the hell is that ?

1735
01:58:25,060 --> 01:58:27,140
It's nothing more than a limp rope

1736
01:58:30,890 --> 01:58:34,260
WTF ??!!

1737
01:58:41,370 --> 01:58:42,380
Click

1738
01:58:47,030 --> 01:58:50,780
Where did they rehearse this ?

1739
01:58:51,230 --> 01:58:53,680
It's nothing more than a small bag

1740
01:58:53,880 --> 01:58:55,380
What're you doing with it ?

1741
01:58:56,080 --> 01:58:58,380
Will this be a strong finish?

1742
01:59:00,090 --> 01:59:03,500
WTF ??!!

1743
01:59:06,610 --> 01:59:08,040
Thank you

1744
01:59:10,080 --> 01:59:12,180
Thanks a lot

1745
01:59:17,110 --> 01:59:18,380
How ?

1746
01:59:24,980 --> 01:59:26,980
Well, since we're already here,

1747
01:59:27,180 --> 01:59:29,280
Why don't we hang around for awhile ?

1748
01:59:33,040 --> 01:59:34,620
Why the cold shoulder ?

1749
01:59:35,500 --> 01:59:37,780
You would be like this if you were in our shoes

1750
01:59:38,930 --> 01:59:40,130
WHAT DO YOU MEAN ?

1751
01:59:41,220 --> 01:59:42,180
I'm just saying

1752
01:59:42,970 --> 01:59:44,330
When you were in our shoes in a past

1753
01:59:44,460 --> 01:59:45,680
you had a very similar reaction

1754
01:59:46,930 --> 01:59:47,750
I see...

1755
01:59:49,580 --> 01:59:51,480
I'm sorry for not getting that

1756
01:59:51,770 --> 01:59:52,950
You gotta understand our situation

1757
01:59:53,280 --> 01:59:55,220
We thought you'd appreciate our efforts a little more

1758
01:59:55,760 --> 01:59:57,830
You thought your skit would get a better reaction ?

1759
01:59:58,220 --> 01:59:58,990
Yeah, I thought it would

1760
01:59:59,350 --> 02:00:00,390
But you understand that

1761
02:00:00,740 --> 02:00:03,030
we're not in a position to freely laugh, right ?

1762
02:00:03,030 --> 02:00:04,530
we're not in a position to freely laugh, right ?

1763
02:00:04,850 --> 02:00:08,740
Well, we thought you'd just laugh regardless

1764
02:00:09,410 --> 02:00:10,490
But if we had laughed,

1765
02:00:10,960 --> 02:00:14,580
we'd get butt slapped

1766
02:00:12,080 --> 02:00:14,980
WHAT DO YOU MEAN ?

1767
02:00:23,160 --> 02:00:24,540
Me ?!

1768
02:00:28,780 --> 02:00:31,080
So this is how a batsu is delivered

1769
02:00:32,480 --> 02:00:33,580
Amazing

1770
02:00:34,280 --> 02:00:35,780
That's some slap !

1771
02:00:36,040 --> 02:00:37,010
Incredible

1772
02:00:37,830 --> 02:00:40,780
We really don't wanna be bothered

1773
02:00:40,080 --> 02:00:41,080
Ouch

1774
02:00:42,580 --> 02:00:45,580
That's the worst he's hurt my feelings since we started Downtown

1775
02:00:51,340 --> 02:00:52,420
Why ?

1776
02:00:52,580 --> 02:00:54,380
I didn't make it ?

1777
02:00:56,190 --> 02:00:57,550
Why would you say that ?

1778
02:00:59,220 --> 02:01:00,190
A full swing

1779
02:01:02,580 --> 02:01:03,880
You know what, guys ?

1780
02:01:04,060 --> 02:01:05,540
Since I'm senior to you

1781
02:01:06,430 --> 02:01:08,680
you will be spared from a butt-slap

1782
02:01:08,770 --> 02:01:11,200
if you greet us with some enthusiasm

1783
02:01:11,980 --> 02:01:13,130
I'm sure it will be OK

1784
02:01:13,730 --> 02:01:15,130
Say something like, "Good morning !!"

1785
02:01:15,340 --> 02:01:16,670
I believe it's acceptable if done that way

1786
02:01:17,180 --> 02:01:19,080
But I'd be smiling at the same time

1787
02:01:18,580 --> 02:01:20,570
No, it wouldn't count as a laugh

1788
02:01:20,690 --> 02:01:22,680
People would see you as an "Upbeat" kid

1789
02:01:22,730 --> 02:01:24,490
So when it's a formal greeting, we're spared ?

1790
02:01:24,980 --> 02:01:26,010
GOOD MORNING !!

1791
02:01:28,740 --> 02:01:29,740
See ?

1792
02:01:34,580 --> 02:01:36,780
You're taking us seniors for fools

1793
02:01:38,620 --> 02:01:39,620
Fujiwara !

1794
02:01:40,230 --> 02:01:41,410
Where's my Fujiwara ?!

1795
02:01:43,410 --> 02:01:44,490
Excuse me

1796
02:01:44,780 --> 02:01:46,570
Here comes MY Fujiwara !

1797
02:01:49,770 --> 02:01:50,540
What do you want to play ?

1798
02:01:50,780 --> 02:01:52,570
Well, you're not giving us much of a choice

1799
02:01:53,210 --> 02:01:54,010
Let's play

1800
02:01:54,960 --> 02:01:56,220
We've played this word game before

1801
02:01:56,610 --> 02:01:57,970
Oh, I think we know

1802
02:01:58,480 --> 02:02:00,480
Anyway, your Batsu will be the Thai Kick

1803
02:02:00,700 --> 02:02:04,820
POP UP PIRATE
*SHIRITORI* Directions:
Players get swords for each syllable of a word.
The swords are then inserted into the barrel

1804
02:02:00,700 --> 02:02:08,530
*see
www.shibatabread.com
for SHIRITORI explanation

1805
02:02:01,980 --> 02:02:02,980
Are you serious ?

1806
02:02:03,580 --> 02:02:04,680
That's a tough rule

1807
02:02:05,320 --> 02:02:08,530
POP UP PIRATE
If the player's sword pops the pirate's head, he receives the Batsu

1808
02:02:06,500 --> 02:02:07,960
I don't know how much more kicking my butt can take

1809
02:02:08,830 --> 02:02:10,270
This isn't anything unusual

1810
02:02:11,130 --> 02:02:12,030
We're all playing, right ?

1811
02:02:12,630 --> 02:02:13,580
No, just you three

1812
02:02:13,580 --> 02:02:14,540
What ?

1813
02:02:15,320 --> 02:02:16,950
OK, Fujiwara, you're in, too

1814
02:02:17,360 --> 02:02:20,480
Rule:
Four Players including Fujiwara

1815
02:02:20,880 --> 02:02:22,800
Why don't we start with Hama-chan ?

1816
02:02:23,460 --> 02:02:26,650
Isn't today New Year's Eve ? (OH-MI-SO-KA)

1817
02:02:27,090 --> 02:02:28,440
Let's start with KA

1818
02:02:28,980 --> 02:02:34,380
OH-MI-SO-KA   --->   KA

1819
02:02:32,780 --> 02:02:34,230
I'm picking KA (mosquito)

1820
02:02:34,380 --> 02:02:45,080
OH-MI-SO-KA   --->   KA

1821
02:02:36,830 --> 02:02:37,720
How dare you ?

1822
02:02:39,090 --> 02:02:41,220
Can't you be more adventurous ?

1823
02:02:40,990 --> 02:02:42,300
No, I want to stick with KA (mosquito)

1824
02:02:42,520 --> 02:02:43,470
Alright, you get one sword then

1825
02:02:53,000 --> 02:02:57,470
Hamada Receives Thai Kick !!

1826
02:02:57,970 --> 02:03:00,130
This isn't rigged, I swear !

1827
02:03:07,080 --> 02:03:08,480
Hamada-san, you got it with just one sword

1828
02:03:10,500 --> 02:03:13,370
OK, let's continue, Hama-chan

1829
02:03:12,800 --> 02:03:13,870
Please, proceed

1830
02:03:15,020 --> 02:03:16,960
How about you start with TSU from word KEI-SA-TSU (policeman) ??

1831
02:03:15,480 --> 02:03:18,980
KEI-SA-TSU   --->   TSU-BA-ME

1832
02:03:17,080 --> 02:03:18,270
How about TSU-BA-ME (swallows) ??

1833
02:03:18,980 --> 02:03:30,980
KEI-SA-TSU   --->   TSU-BA-ME

1834
02:03:23,230 --> 02:03:24,310
I'm sensing this head will pop

1835
02:03:24,400 --> 02:03:26,300
If you get this again, it'll be something else

1836
02:03:30,970 --> 02:03:31,890
Wow, he made it through

1837
02:03:32,580 --> 02:03:33,980
Fujiwara, you're up

1838
02:03:34,380 --> 02:03:35,580
KEI-SA-TSU   --->   TSU-BA-ME   --->   ME-DA-KA

1839
02:03:34,480 --> 02:03:35,730
How about ME-DA-KA (kill fish) ?

1840
02:03:35,580 --> 02:03:39,080
KEI-SA-TSU   --->   TSU-BA-ME   --->   ME-DA-KA

1841
02:03:37,570 --> 02:03:38,410
Here's your 3 swords

1842
02:03:50,780 --> 02:03:52,180
Yamasaki, start the word with KA

1843
02:03:52,580 --> 02:03:54,580
I'm going with KA-NI (crab)

1844
02:03:52,680 --> 02:03:53,980
KEI-SA-TSU   --->   TSU-BA-ME   --->   ME-DA-KA   --->   KA-NI

1845
02:03:53,980 --> 02:04:03,080
KEI-SA-TSU   --->   TSU-BA-ME   --->   ME-DA-KA   --->   KA-NI

1846
02:03:55,660 --> 02:03:57,180
What kind of KA-NI ?

1847
02:03:57,740 --> 02:04:01,140
If I have to be more specific,
I can't start the word with KA

1848
02:04:09,770 --> 02:04:10,890
Don't make me laugh !

1849
02:04:12,480 --> 02:04:14,100
What's wrong with just KANI ??

1850
02:04:23,730 --> 02:04:24,970
Your butt must be in bad shape

1851
02:04:26,210 --> 02:04:27,130
This isn't cool

1852
02:04:29,380 --> 02:04:37,080
KA-NI   --->

1853
02:04:29,580 --> 02:04:31,320
OK, I'm going with KANI

1854
02:04:30,570 --> 02:04:31,370
I'll let you slide this time with KANI

1855
02:04:39,070 --> 02:04:43,710
Yamasaki Receives Thai Kick !!

1856
02:04:56,880 --> 02:04:57,630
It kills doesn't it ?

1857
02:04:58,360 --> 02:04:59,470
It really does hurt bad

1858
02:05:00,100 --> 02:05:00,730
I'm not kiddin'

1859
02:05:04,410 --> 02:05:05,600
I don't want a Thai Kick

1860
02:05:07,010 --> 02:05:09,180
Isn't there anything other than the Thai Kick ?

1861
02:05:09,700 --> 02:05:10,440
What would you like ?

1862
02:05:12,060 --> 02:05:12,750
How about this, then ?

1863
02:05:14,610 --> 02:05:15,830
Let's do some Tongue-Twisters, then

1864
02:05:15,400 --> 02:05:16,810
What's the Batsu for this ?

1865
02:05:17,110 --> 02:05:18,890
Of course, it's a Thai Kick if you mess up

1866
02:05:19,300 --> 02:05:24,680
Tongue-Twister
Stuttering results in
a Thai Kick

1867
02:05:20,870 --> 02:05:21,590
I don't wanna another Thai Kick

1868
02:05:22,280 --> 02:05:23,690
Spare us from the Kick, please ?

1869
02:05:24,140 --> 02:05:24,700
No way

1870
02:05:25,390 --> 02:05:25,950
Here's the first one

1871
02:05:26,290 --> 02:05:27,210
Say this three times

1872
02:05:27,720 --> 02:05:31,580
Say 3 Times: "Bus Gas Bakuhatsu"
(Bus Gas Explosion)

1873
02:05:29,440 --> 02:05:30,230
Let's go

1874
02:05:31,800 --> 02:05:38,780
Tongue-Twister: "Bus Gas Bakuhatsu"

1875
02:05:34,870 --> 02:05:37,800
GASU BAKUHATSU

1876
02:05:39,840 --> 02:05:46,920
Hamada Receives his Second Thai Kick !!

1877
02:05:55,700 --> 02:05:57,300
What's that on your lip ?

1878
02:05:58,760 --> 02:05:59,930
What's the white thingy ??

1879
02:06:03,400 --> 02:06:04,520
Wait, listen

1880
02:06:05,010 --> 02:06:07,000
I can't stop farting

1881
02:06:07,420 --> 02:06:09,540
I'm farting non-stop

1882
02:06:11,670 --> 02:06:15,230
Why don't we move on to the next game ?

1883
02:06:15,710 --> 02:06:17,120
Let's see some impersonations

1884
02:06:17,530 --> 02:06:18,600
How about Keisuke Kuwata ?

1885
02:06:19,030 --> 02:06:21,780
Impersonation:
Name one fish as you impersonate Keisuke Kuwata

1886
02:06:20,690 --> 02:06:21,710

02:06:22,080 --> 02:06:27,980
Name a fish while impersonating Keisuke Kuwata

1888

Tuna~~

1889
02:06:32,670 --> 02:06:34,370
That was pretty funny

1890
02:06:37,750 --> 02:06:38,610
Endo, you're next

1891
02:06:39,820 --> 02:06:41,260
Name one fish

1892
02:06:40,580 --> 02:06:46,380
Name a fish while impersonating Keisuke Kuwata

1893
02:06:43,440 --> 02:06:46,280
Bluegill~~

1894
02:06:50,680 --> 02:06:52,080
You two were going at each other

1895
02:06:53,380 --> 02:06:55,080
Hamada, you did OK here

1896
02:06:56,480 --> 02:07:02,580
Name a fish while impersonating Keisuke Kuwata

1897
02:06:56,690 --> 02:06:57,550
Hamada, you're on

1898
02:06:59,890 --> 02:07:02,770
Mackerel~~

1899
02:07:09,490 --> 02:07:11,140
Will you at least try a little ?

1900
02:07:14,490 --> 02:07:15,560
Fujiwara, you're on

1901
02:07:15,880 --> 02:07:20,080
Name a fish while impersonating Keisuke Kuwata

1902
02:07:16,660 --> 02:07:19,880
Flying fish~~

1903
02:07:20,380 --> 02:07:22,380
Who would pick "Flying fish" ??

1904
02:07:27,380 --> 02:07:32,380
Translation by Shibatabread

1905
02:07:30,380 --> 02:07:31,480
Let's see Shinichi Mori

1906
02:07:31,550 --> 02:07:32,780
Sounds good to me

1907
02:07:36,030 --> 02:07:39,850
Impersonation:
Name something "long" while impersonating Shinichi Mori

1908
02:07:37,040 --> 02:07:38,080
Yamasaki, you're up first

1909
02:07:45,360 --> 02:07:47,950
Carp Streamer~~

1910
02:07:54,590 --> 02:07:56,700
Is that considered "Long" ??

1911
02:07:57,410 --> 02:07:58,020
What ?

1912
02:07:58,670 --> 02:07:59,970
Carps are long, aren't they ?

1913
02:08:05,340 --> 02:08:07,710
Bullet Train

1914
02:08:14,230 --> 02:08:15,060
Wow

1915
02:08:15,750 --> 02:08:17,750
That was an awesome slap

1916
02:08:22,860 --> 02:08:23,670
Let's change it up again

1917
02:08:26,990 --> 02:08:31,650
Impersonation:
Name a country while impersonating Kenichi Mikawa

1918
02:08:33,720 --> 02:08:35,400
Thailand

1919
02:08:45,370 --> 02:08:46,580
They're trying to destroy each other

1920
02:08:53,850 --> 02:08:55,740
Canada

1921
02:08:59,950 --> 02:09:01,950
This turned into a show for you two

1922
02:09:02,950 --> 02:09:06,180
You two are just going at each other !

1923
02:09:16,130 --> 02:09:17,540
India

1924
02:09:40,710 --> 02:09:42,980
Shall we go now ?

1925
02:09:43,760 --> 02:09:46,240
I'm still irritated they dissed us

1926
02:09:48,450 --> 02:09:49,750
You guys are just gonna let us leave ?

1927
02:09:49,800 --> 02:09:51,320
No "Thanks for coming" ??

1928
02:09:51,720 --> 02:09:52,870
Oh, thank you for coming

1929
02:09:54,350 --> 02:09:55,170
Good job

1930
02:09:59,250 --> 02:10:00,450
Thanks

1931
02:09:59,400 --> 02:10:00,590
Is music necessary ?

1932
02:10:01,960 --> 02:10:02,840
Thanks

1933
02:10:03,620 --> 02:10:04,210
Thank you

1934
02:10:05,470 --> 02:10:06,050
See you around

1935
02:10:07,060 --> 02:10:07,670
See you soon

1936
02:10:13,320 --> 02:10:14,200
That sucked

1937
02:10:16,960 --> 02:10:19,240
That Thai kick really hurt me right here

1938
02:10:19,980 --> 02:10:20,760
Your left cheek ?

1939
02:10:21,370 --> 02:10:22,240
It messed me up

1940
02:10:24,550 --> 02:10:26,610
The batsu game is almost half way done

1941
02:10:36,350 --> 02:10:50,200
Yoshimoto Entertainment: Vice President
Hiroshi Ohsaki

1942
02:10:36,420 --> 02:10:39,370

1945
02:10:51,070 --> 02:10:52,160
What the hell...?

1946
02:10:54,440 --> 02:10:56,020
Mr. Ohsaki announcing 9:00pm...

1947
02:10:57,570 --> 02:10:58,680

1949
02:11:07,250 --> 02:11:08,150

02:11:14,130 --> 02:11:15,260
Let's go check it out

1953
02:11:16,690 --> 02:11:18,290
Show a little more enthusiasm

02:11:24,180 --> 02:11:35,900
A Nice Gesture from the Station:

This is only for you guys

1956
02:11:31,280 --> 02:11:32,440
Unprecedented

1957
02:11:33,340 --> 02:11:35,180
Can't you crack a smile or two ?

1958
02:11:35,820 --> 02:11:38,330
I'm proud to start the welcome party

1959
02:11:38,860 --> 02:11:41,960
for the new trainees

1960
02:11:46,700 --> 02:11:48,060
He kinda looks like Fujiwara

1961
02:11:50,050 --> 02:11:52,030
Let me introduce you to the legendary duo

1962
02:11:52,550 --> 02:11:54,540
who reunited just for this occasion !

1963
02:11:54,970 --> 02:11:56,400

The Other "Alice" member
Takao Horiuchi (impersonated by Fokkie)

1966
02:12:20,460 --> 02:12:22,170
The resemblance is uncanny

1967
02:12:25,610 --> 02:12:27,250
They look and sing just like the real thing

1968
02:12:28,520 --> 02:12:30,400
They look just like them !

1969
02:12:31,810 --> 02:12:32,670
Amazing

1970
02:13:01,340 --> 02:13:03,620
No way No way

1971
02:13:25,600 --> 02:13:28,750
We're fortunate to witness this legendary duo reunite

1972
02:13:29,240 --> 02:13:31,350
The duo "Alice" had been broken up for a while

1973
02:13:32,200 --> 02:13:33,740
Let's move on to our next act

1974
02:13:34,490 --> 02:13:36,940
He's the best folk musician we've ever heard

1975

1977
02:14:23,490 --> 02:14:24,830
Good evening

1978
02:14:25,510 --> 02:14:27,170
to you all

1979
02:14:45,430 --> 02:14:46,560
What can you do ?

1980
02:14:47,120 --> 02:14:49,350
They don't mean any harm

1981
02:14:50,460 --> 02:14:52,500
Let's bring out the next act

1982
02:14:53,070 --> 02:14:55,500
No adolescents ever missed this imported gem

1983
02:14:56,070 --> 02:14:57,990
Here's two actors from that show !

1984
02:15:05,180 --> 02:15:14,730
From Beverly Hills 90210
Catherine & Dylan
(Tomochika & Takeshi Nadagi)

1985
02:15:14,610 --> 02:15:15,850
Why here ?

1986
02:15:18,380 --> 02:15:19,280
Wait a minute

1987
02:15:19,180 --> 02:15:20,200
I'll be right there

1988
02:15:20,590 --> 02:15:21,830
I'm closer

1989
02:15:21,490 --> 02:15:22,580
OK, I'm here

1990
02:15:23,800 --> 02:15:25,370
Where were we ?

1991
02:15:25,380 --> 02:15:27,320
Why am I always wrong ?

1992
02:15:27,120 --> 02:15:28,880
Take it easy

1993
02:15:27,370 --> 02:15:29,250
And why're you avoiding me ??

1994
02:15:29,250 --> 02:15:30,180
Take it easy

1995
02:15:29,830 --> 02:15:32,980
Didn't I tell you to meet me
at the mall in Eastville ?

1996
02:15:33,380 --> 02:15:35,230
Why don't you bake me
that cheese cake ?

1997
02:15:35,720 --> 02:15:37,100
I tell you what though

1998
02:15:37,650 --> 02:15:38,730
What's with raisins in the cheese cake ?

1999
02:15:39,220 --> 02:15:40,300
I hate raisins

2000
02:15:41,040 --> 02:15:42,520
And how many times do I have to tell you that ?

2001
02:15:42,380 --> 02:15:44,380
Wait a minute

2002
02:15:43,120 --> 02:15:44,100
You just don't care to remember that

2003
02:15:44,620 --> 02:15:45,200
Hold it

2004
02:15:45,580 --> 02:15:46,260
What's the matter ?

2005
02:15:45,620 --> 02:15:48,620
I don't recall baking
any cheese cake for you

2006
02:15:48,370 --> 02:15:49,370
What're you talking about ?

2007
02:15:49,530 --> 02:15:52,280
On top of that,
I don't put raisins in my cheese cake

2008
02:15:52,000 --> 02:15:53,220
I know what I know

2009
02:15:53,710 --> 02:15:55,170
Just calm down

2010
02:15:54,750 --> 02:15:56,640
Who are you mixing me up with ?

2011
02:15:57,070 --> 02:15:58,090
I know what I remember

2012
02:15:59,620 --> 02:16:06,780
Swear on this flag ?

2013
02:16:02,270 --> 02:16:06,780
Who knew you had the national flag ?

2014
02:16:06,930 --> 02:16:07,680
You got me

2015
02:16:07,830 --> 02:16:10,030
Here's the truth

2016
02:16:10,060 --> 02:16:11,600
Well.....Kevin is the one

2017
02:16:11,600 --> 02:16:13,370
Well.....Kevin is the one

2018
02:16:13,860 --> 02:16:14,790
How could you ?

2019
02:16:15,210 --> 02:16:16,320
What about all the emails

2020
02:16:16,650 --> 02:16:17,410
and all the letters?

2021
02:16:18,400 --> 02:16:18,910
Well, um...

2022
02:16:19,940 --> 02:16:22,210
I got your emails and letters

2023
02:16:22,210 --> 02:16:23,380
Day after day

2024
02:16:24,710 --> 02:16:27,980
Listen to me

2025
02:16:29,210 --> 02:16:32,830
What about those days you didn't call me ??

2026
02:16:32,650 --> 02:16:34,980
I'm afraid you're right

2027
02:16:35,540 --> 02:16:36,200
Anyway,

2028
02:16:36,730 --> 02:16:39,180
Kevin and I just got together
to have a drink

2029
02:16:39,230 --> 02:16:39,990
Don't get upset

2030
02:16:40,330 --> 02:16:40,860
Just calm down

2031
02:16:41,140 --> 02:16:41,760
How can't I be...

2032
02:16:42,160 --> 02:16:42,880
How can't I be upset ?

2033
02:16:43,380 --> 02:16:45,280
Dylan, I don't know what to believe anymore

2034
02:16:45,670 --> 02:16:46,790
Don't leave

2035
02:16:47,200 --> 02:16:47,850
Wait up

2036
02:16:48,270 --> 02:16:49,220
You should not have left here

2037
02:16:49,600 --> 02:16:50,530
Absolutely not

2038
02:16:53,550 --> 02:16:56,080
But I'm coming to get you !

2039
02:16:59,080 --> 02:17:00,830
That was a long one

2040
02:17:05,380 --> 02:17:06,580
That was funny

2041
02:17:09,400 --> 02:17:11,090
That was pretty impressive

2042
02:17:11,850 --> 02:17:13,000
That was entertaining

2043
02:17:15,310 --> 02:17:17,570
Unfortunately, this will be our last act

2044
02:17:20,150 --> 02:17:21,320
From Ishihara group

2045
02:17:22,140 --> 02:17:23,930
give it up for this man

2046
02:17:25,000 --> 02:17:26,310
Come on out !

2047
02:17:37,520 --> 02:17:42,720
From Ishihara Group
Hiroshi Tachi (Producer P)

2048
02:17:44,270 --> 02:17:46,170
One left out glass...cigarette

2049
02:17:46,170 --> 02:17:47,760
One left out glass...cigarette

2050
02:17:52,950 --> 02:17:54,520
How irritating ?

2051
02:17:57,010 --> 02:17:58,990
That's not how that song goes

2052
02:17:58,990 --> 02:18:00,040
How can you mess that up ?

2053
02:18:00,540 --> 02:18:02,220
You left out "glass"...

2054
02:18:06,760 --> 02:18:07,560
What's wrong with him ?

2055
02:18:09,730 --> 02:18:11,600
He's not singing loud enough either

2056
02:18:12,460 --> 02:18:14,960
Left out "glass" ??

2057
02:18:15,260 --> 02:18:16,590
Nobody would mess that up

2058
02:18:16,660 --> 02:18:18,480
Everyone would get that right for sure

2059
02:18:19,840 --> 02:18:20,930
There's been a lot going on already

2060
02:18:21,410 --> 02:18:22,470
So much stuff

2061
02:18:24,270 --> 02:18:25,140
Hear me out, Tanaka

2062
02:18:25,590 --> 02:18:28,810
We didn't have to be there, you know ?

2063
02:18:27,860 --> 02:18:33,160
W-Jeans

2064
02:18:29,340 --> 02:18:30,490
We were exempt from this year's event

2065
02:18:30,890 --> 02:18:32,270
We had no part in this year's "Batsu Game"

2066
02:18:32,310 --> 02:18:34,820
But we thought it'd be a nice gesture on our part

2067
02:18:34,850 --> 02:18:36,260
to show some support for you guys

2068
02:18:36,310 --> 02:18:38,450
So I was disappointed with your poor receptions

2069
02:18:38,480 --> 02:18:39,480
What do you mean ??

2070
02:18:39,960 --> 02:18:41,210
We were very welcoming

2071
02:18:42,020 --> 02:18:43,860
I thought you guys would erupt with joy

2072
02:18:43,890 --> 02:18:46,340
But we get the "Batsu" if we "erupt"

2073
02:18:46,560 --> 02:18:48,560
Remember the "Gas Bakuhatsu (explosion)" ??

2074
02:18:49,150 --> 02:18:51,900
Honestly, that was a very low point of yours

2075
02:18:52,090 --> 02:18:53,330
That's why we don't wanna get old

2076
02:18:53,820 --> 02:18:56,090
You also had some weird white stuff coming outta your mouth

2077
02:18:57,260 --> 02:18:58,460
What was that you spit out ??

2078
02:19:00,560 --> 02:19:02,520
And the shack exploding was something else

2079
02:19:03,860 --> 02:19:05,810
I bet Haruka-san had no idea he'd been taped

2080
02:19:06,420 --> 02:19:07,890
He jumped, didn't he ?

2081
02:19:06,540 --> 02:19:12,170
Elite Detective
Haruka

2082
02:19:08,460 --> 02:19:09,460
He had no idea

2083
02:19:09,860 --> 02:19:11,780
His face glowed red for a second

2084
02:19:12,270 --> 02:19:13,130
Let's get back

2085
02:19:13,570 --> 02:19:14,180
to the video !

2086
02:19:20,110 --> 02:19:21,100
Good job

2087
02:19:22,390 --> 02:19:22,990
Good job

2088
02:19:23,560 --> 02:19:24,230
Good job

2089
02:19:25,720 --> 02:19:28,860
As the Game Reaches its Peak,
The Most Notorious Guest Makes Her Cameo !!

2090
02:19:28,960 --> 02:19:35,860
Laughter and Screams Fly Around

2091
02:19:35,930 --> 02:19:49,230
Sobriety Check Point

2092
02:19:36,020 --> 02:19:42,980
Interrogate the Big Star !!

2093
02:19:43,360 --> 02:19:46,880
How Do You Deal with A Drunken Celebrity ??

2094
02:19:46,830 --> 02:19:47,730
Wait a minute !!

2095
02:19:47,730 --> 02:19:49,240
No no no no no no no !!

2096
02:19:49,470 --> 02:19:56,360
Legendary Man Revisited...

2097
02:19:57,520 --> 02:20:02,560
A Heart-Felt Ceremony
What Do the Three Trainees Witness in the End ??

2098
02:20:03,770 --> 02:20:07,020
It's been 13 hours since the start

2099
02:20:08,320 --> 02:20:13,520
The non-stop Batsu's have started to take its toll on the 3 trainees

2100
02:20:16,010 --> 02:20:17,730
Is this blues music I hear ?

2101
02:20:21,130 --> 02:20:23,550
Why don't we continue your training

2102
02:20:23,960 --> 02:20:25,100
Come with me

2103
02:20:25,730 --> 02:20:26,850
I remember this

2104
02:20:28,560 --> 02:20:30,520
This is the first time I've seen this footage

2105
02:20:31,390 --> 02:20:32,150
Is that right ?

2106
02:20:32,820 --> 02:20:35,280
We had no way of seeing this until tonight

2107
02:20:35,880 --> 02:20:36,770
This is it

2108
02:20:37,470 --> 02:20:38,580
It's her

2109
02:20:38,300 --> 02:20:39,250
Here's Dr. Nishikawa

2110
02:20:38,420 --> 02:20:41,360
Medical Examiner
Ayako Nishikawa

2111
02:20:39,780 --> 02:20:41,230
She's a medical examiner

2112
02:20:42,180 --> 02:20:43,090
This part killed me

2113
02:20:42,360 --> 02:20:43,070
Nice to meet you all

2114
02:20:43,840 --> 02:20:44,760
You, too

2115
02:20:45,360 --> 02:20:51,070
Learn from Dr. Nishikawa
Medical Examining From A to Z

2116
02:20:46,290 --> 02:20:48,020
I hope you can learn something from tonight's lesson

2117
02:20:49,140 --> 02:20:51,500
First, here are tonight's subjects

2118
02:20:54,110 --> 02:20:55,160
Here's a janitor

2119
02:20:54,830 --> 02:20:57,460
Subject 1:
Janitor (Mr. Ohnuma)

2120
02:20:58,910 --> 02:21:00,690
Here's Mr. Nukumizu

2121
02:21:01,340 --> 02:21:04,360
Subject 2:
Yoichi Nukumizu

2122
02:21:05,770 --> 02:21:06,420
Nice

2123
02:21:10,300 --> 02:21:13,860
Subject 3:
Lunatic (Mr. Nakamura)

2124
02:21:13,620 --> 02:21:15,360
Why bother with sunglasses ?

2125
02:21:21,760 --> 02:21:22,610
She had me already

2126
02:21:29,090 --> 02:21:30,760
Why don't I start the experiment then ?

2127
02:21:33,710 --> 02:21:37,160
Experiment 1:
S&M Candles

2128
02:21:33,800 --> 02:21:35,970
I'm proving to you that they are corpses

2129
02:21:36,360 --> 02:21:37,190
Are you sure ?

2130
02:21:38,110 --> 02:21:40,480
I kinda wanted to talk with this guy

2131
02:21:43,480 --> 02:21:44,820
See, they're really dead

2132
02:21:50,720 --> 02:21:52,020
I saw him move

2133
02:21:52,160 --> 02:21:53,110
No, you didn't

2134
02:21:53,260 --> 02:21:54,310
Let's move on

2135
02:21:54,660 --> 02:21:56,860
Let's aim for his nipples

2136
02:22:06,280 --> 02:22:07,710
This isn't good

2137
02:22:13,390 --> 02:22:14,670
That looked Ouchy

2138
02:22:15,770 --> 02:22:16,910
Are you understanding this ?

2139
02:22:17,680 --> 02:22:19,420
They are utterly dead

2140
02:22:24,560 --> 02:22:26,660
Let's use 6 candles

2141
02:22:28,670 --> 02:22:29,980
I wonder what he's thinking

2142
02:22:37,860 --> 02:22:39,490
He's wiggling

2143
02:22:45,260 --> 02:22:47,760
I can tell Hamada's really into these types of things

2144
02:22:48,130 --> 02:22:48,930
He's loving it

2145
02:22:51,660 --> 02:22:52,550
Are you guys OK ?

2146
02:22:53,340 --> 02:22:54,580
How about these then ?

2147
02:22:55,240 --> 02:22:58,900
Experiment 2:
Paper Strings

2148
02:22:57,860 --> 02:22:59,880
I'm going to stick these into their nostrils

2149
02:22:59,910 --> 02:23:00,560
But I'm telling you

2150
02:23:00,610 --> 02:23:01,610
They won't show any response

2151
02:23:01,680 --> 02:23:02,760
God, I wish I could've done this

2152
02:23:06,420 --> 02:23:07,460
He's moving
He's moving

2153
02:23:09,430 --> 02:23:10,650
I don't like this

2154
02:23:12,900 --> 02:23:14,040
I hate it

2155
02:23:18,580 --> 02:23:20,120
Dr. Nishikawa is evil, isn't she ?

2156
02:23:22,310 --> 02:23:23,630
Let's see how he does

2157
02:23:34,540 --> 02:23:36,020
I'm seriously hating this

2158
02:23:41,350 --> 02:23:42,530
We need to get it together

2159
02:23:43,030 --> 02:23:44,440
or our butt's are in for a long haul

2160
02:23:44,860 --> 02:23:46,110
I can't do this anymore

2161
02:23:46,260 --> 02:23:48,840
She's too much into my style (Sadism)

2162
02:23:51,860 --> 02:23:53,150
Next, I will use this slipper

2163
02:23:53,070 --> 02:23:56,880
Experiment 3:
Slipper

2164
02:23:54,080 --> 02:23:55,750
They won't respond to it at all

2165
02:23:55,230 --> 02:23:56,710
She's outta control

2166
02:24:04,900 --> 02:24:06,790
I hate this
I hate this

2167
02:24:07,410 --> 02:24:08,490
I hate it !

2168
02:24:15,630 --> 02:24:17,080
I saw his hand trying to cover his face

2169
02:24:25,880 --> 02:24:26,860
No, he's not responding

2170
02:24:34,210 --> 02:24:35,650
I'm serious

2171
02:24:36,480 --> 02:24:37,860
I can't take this anymore

2172
02:25:03,570 --> 02:25:04,830
She wouldn't stop

2173
02:25:07,530 --> 02:25:08,510
Incredible

2174
02:25:08,790 --> 02:25:09,800
This was nuts

2175
02:25:10,340 --> 02:25:13,240
Even dead bodies show red marks
where they were hit

2176
02:25:12,520 --> 02:25:13,490
Nonsense

2177
02:25:13,870 --> 02:25:16,140
Look, his hair's thinning out from the beatings

2178
02:25:16,700 --> 02:25:18,590
No, he's just going bald

2179
02:25:19,810 --> 02:25:23,170
Experiment 4:
Electric Pads

2180
02:25:25,170 --> 02:25:26,470
Aren't there more sensitive parts ?

2181
02:25:38,960 --> 02:25:40,660
Of course, you'd laugh at that

2182
02:25:42,460 --> 02:25:43,870
My ass is going numb

2183
02:25:50,580 --> 02:25:51,920
Are you still zapping him ?!

2184
02:25:53,780 --> 02:25:54,950
That's a long session

2185
02:26:02,340 --> 02:26:03,660
Please, no more !

2186
02:26:04,060 --> 02:26:05,190
Seriously, no more !

2187
02:26:05,750 --> 02:26:06,710
Please stop now !

2188
02:26:15,640 --> 02:26:18,800
Lastly, let's see how they do with this

2189
02:26:16,110 --> 02:26:19,260
Experiment 5:
Pie Throwing

2190
02:26:29,510 --> 02:26:30,360
Amazing

2191
02:26:50,990 --> 02:26:53,440
Moving on with the next subject

2192
02:26:58,590 --> 02:27:00,130
She has no reservation doing this

2193
02:27:00,730 --> 02:27:01,610
See ?
No reaction

2194
02:27:04,570 --> 02:27:05,310
What ?

2195
02:27:08,920 --> 02:27:12,160
How about if I close both his nostrils and mouth ?

2196
02:27:12,570 --> 02:27:13,440
Out of control

2197
02:27:26,050 --> 02:27:27,450
She's fearless

2198
02:27:35,110 --> 02:27:36,520
I understand this is all for an experiment

2199
02:27:36,570 --> 02:27:38,410
But is it really acceptable ??

2200
02:27:38,670 --> 02:27:41,110
I'm doing this for your training

2201
02:27:41,480 --> 02:27:44,660
Well, I can appreciate your (Sadistic) ways...

2202
02:27:46,100 --> 02:27:47,740
What do you mean "your way ?"

2203
02:27:49,060 --> 02:27:50,490
Please continue

2204
02:27:57,390 --> 02:27:58,640
Why not try a couple more ?

2205
02:28:00,520 --> 02:28:02,510
I just saw him sneezing out some pie

2206
02:28:06,910 --> 02:28:08,830
Did you see anything funny ?

2207
02:28:13,560 --> 02:28:14,630
It was obvious

2208
02:28:16,450 --> 02:28:18,710
This was rough for you guys

2209
02:28:20,680 --> 02:28:22,560
Hopefully, you got to learn a thing or two ?

2210
02:28:23,450 --> 02:28:25,300
I didn't realize how dead they were

2211
02:28:26,020 --> 02:28:28,130
This made me not wanna die for sure

2212
02:28:29,690 --> 02:28:32,790
It's been 14 hours since the start

2213
02:28:34,910 --> 02:28:36,940
That doctor was ruthless

2214
02:28:35,060 --> 02:28:44,600
Dr. Nishikawa

2215
02:28:37,430 --> 02:28:39,290
The slippers were something else

2216
02:28:40,570 --> 02:28:41,670
That type of behavior

2217
02:28:42,100 --> 02:28:43,650
makes me laugh really hard

2218
02:28:48,420 --> 02:28:50,850
Let's step outside for the sobriety checkpoint

2219
02:28:50,920 --> 02:28:57,620
Catch Drunk Drivers
Become Familiar with Sobriety Check-points!

2220
02:28:52,980 --> 02:28:54,000
Right now

2221
02:28:55,060 --> 02:28:56,360
We have a tough schedule

2222
02:28:58,220 --> 02:28:59,270
It was hard

2223
02:28:59,720 --> 02:29:01,450
The truth comes out, huh ?

2224
02:29:01,450 --> 02:29:02,350
Yes, it came out

2225
02:29:03,080 --> 02:29:06,710
The 3 are driven out to the checkpoint

2226
02:29:07,200 --> 02:29:13,150
Who awaits them there ?

2227
02:29:13,590 --> 02:29:17,180
Checkpoint

2228
02:29:13,660 --> 02:29:17,330
*Filmed off public roadways

2229
02:29:17,500 --> 02:29:18,480
We're here

2230
02:29:18,910 --> 02:29:22,970
I need you guys to learn
how a checkpoint is carried out

2231
02:29:26,310 --> 02:29:31,720
Distribute the Breathalyzers

2232
02:29:30,550 --> 02:29:31,670
Here's yours, Hamada

2233
02:29:32,480 --> 02:29:34,830
For Hamada

2234
02:29:34,580 --> 02:29:35,850
Here's yours, Endo

2235
02:29:35,770 --> 02:29:39,320
For Endo

2236
02:29:39,990 --> 02:29:41,550
Yamasaki, here you go

2237
02:29:42,190 --> 02:29:43,150
I'm counting on you

2238
02:29:42,880 --> 02:29:48,570
Burdock

2239
02:29:44,850 --> 02:29:45,670
Take it

2240
02:29:47,320 --> 02:29:49,820
I'll demonstrate once
So watch closely

2241
02:29:50,870 --> 02:29:53,780
This shows a person's blood alcohol percentage, right ?

2242
02:30:01,640 --> 02:30:03,430
Roll down the window, please

2243
02:30:04,670 --> 02:30:08,320
On a "Date"
Mikihisa Azuma

2244
02:30:05,310 --> 02:30:07,020
We're conducting a sobriety check tonight

2245
02:30:07,420 --> 02:30:08,660
Would you cooperate with us ?

2246
02:30:08,770 --> 02:30:10,800
Are you checking for drunk driving ?

2247
02:30:20,550 --> 02:30:21,270
Wait

2248
02:30:21,670 --> 02:30:22,800
Will you wait, please ?

2249
02:30:30,080 --> 02:30:33,820
I'm trying to get to Shibuya

2250
02:30:31,440 --> 02:30:34,290
We can help you once your testing is done

2251
02:30:35,360 --> 02:30:36,520
I'm Mikihisa Azuma   Haaaa~

2252
02:30:36,520 --> 02:30:38,650
I'm Mikihisa Azuma   Haaaa~

2253
02:30:38,720 --> 02:30:39,720
How's that ?

2254
02:30:40,590 --> 02:30:41,650
No reading

2255
02:30:42,150 --> 02:30:44,320
Where's Shibuya ?

2256
02:30:44,090 --> 02:30:45,110
Drive straight ahead

2257
02:30:45,500 --> 02:30:46,780
And catch the freeway to Shibuya

2258
02:30:47,780 --> 02:30:48,630
Go straight here ?

2259
02:30:49,090 --> 02:30:49,760
I got it

2260
02:30:50,060 --> 02:30:50,950
Thank you very much

2261
02:30:52,460 --> 02:30:54,720
Please take this as a token of my appreciation

2262
02:30:57,340 --> 02:31:09,680
Statue of Hachiko
in Shibuya

2263
02:30:58,870 --> 02:31:01,320
There's a huge crowd at that Hachiko statue
every Sunday ??

2264
02:31:01,420 --> 02:31:02,870
It's crazy scary, isn't it ?

2265
02:31:03,640 --> 02:31:05,280
Well, I don't think that's "scary" per se

2266
02:31:05,920 --> 02:31:09,570
What'd you mean, "crazy scary ?"

2267
02:31:19,240 --> 02:31:20,280
Will you just go ?

2268
02:31:21,420 --> 02:31:29,320
Shopping Center in Shibuya

2269
02:31:22,130 --> 02:31:24,910
There's tons of shoe stores
and fast-food restaurants ?

2270
02:31:22,950 --> 02:31:23,510
We know

2271
02:31:23,940 --> 02:31:24,960
We've been there

2272
02:31:24,990 --> 02:31:25,980
It's crazy scary, isn't it ?

2273
02:31:27,190 --> 02:31:28,470
Go on already

2274
02:31:30,040 --> 02:31:34,670
Building 109 in Shibuya

2275
02:31:30,350 --> 02:31:31,500
We've been there, too

2276
02:31:30,870 --> 02:31:32,670
Young and hip girls would call it "Maru-kyu"

2277
02:31:32,870 --> 02:31:34,660
Crazy scary, isn't it ?

2278
02:31:34,860 --> 02:31:35,560
That's enough already

2279
02:31:35,880 --> 02:31:36,610
Why don't you just go ?

2280
02:31:37,580 --> 02:31:39,380
Crazy scary

2281
02:31:42,210 --> 02:31:46,020
How do you not know Shibuya ?

2282
02:31:46,040 --> 02:31:48,510
Here comes another one

2283
02:31:49,510 --> 02:31:50,760
This is a busy street

2284
02:32:00,150 --> 02:32:00,780
Excuse us

2285
02:32:02,230 --> 02:32:04,870
Good evening, I'm Shinichi Mori

2286
02:32:04,790 --> 02:32:08,990
Just driving by:
Shinichi Mori ??

2287
02:32:07,800 --> 02:32:09,290
We're conducting a sobriety check

2288
02:32:09,690 --> 02:32:11,590
will you breathe into this ?

2289
02:32:16,820 --> 02:32:21,320
No Reading

2290
02:32:18,540 --> 02:32:20,480
Yamasaki, ask him to do it again

2291
02:32:20,740 --> 02:32:21,770
If you would, please ?

2292
02:32:24,610 --> 02:32:25,790
You didn't find this funny, huh ?

2293
02:32:27,460 --> 02:32:29,220
Thank you very much for your cooperation

2294
02:32:31,770 --> 02:32:32,790
He's supposed to be Shinichi Mori ?

2295
02:32:34,880 --> 02:32:36,280
Well, that's how he introduced himself

2296
02:32:36,970 --> 02:32:37,480
Did he ?

2297
02:32:38,520 --> 02:32:40,270
But would the real guy do that ?

2298
02:32:43,000 --> 02:32:44,520
I see another car

2299
02:32:45,120 --> 02:32:46,240
Yes, here it comes

2300
02:32:49,370 --> 02:32:51,450
I've noticed a lot of celebrities around here

2301
02:32:53,080 --> 02:32:54,850
Will you roll down the window please ?

2302
02:32:56,820 --> 02:33:00,770
For the Second Time
Mikihisa Azuma

2303
02:33:03,780 --> 02:33:04,730
This isn't fair

2304
02:33:05,240 --> 02:33:06,090
Dirty

2305
02:33:07,700 --> 02:33:09,630
Weren't you just here ?

2306
02:33:10,820 --> 02:33:12,620
And who the hell is this chick ?

2307
02:33:13,320 --> 02:33:14,760
It was tough not to laugh at them

2308
02:33:15,120 --> 02:33:17,620
And why is she playing with his nipples and stuff ?

2309
02:33:17,470 --> 02:33:18,960
I drove straight like you told me but

2310
02:33:20,020 --> 02:33:21,490
I couldn't get there

2311
02:33:21,660 --> 02:33:23,460
I really need to get to Shibuya or else...

2312
02:33:23,660 --> 02:33:25,420
I'm in big trouble

2313
02:33:25,700 --> 02:33:27,600
Drive straight up here and get on the freeway

2314
02:33:28,700 --> 02:33:30,320
Will that get me to Shibuya for real ?

2315
02:33:30,640 --> 02:33:31,460
I'm sure of it

2316
02:33:31,670 --> 02:33:33,870
You know Shibuya is where every fad originates ?

2317
02:33:33,950 --> 02:33:34,970
We all know where Shibuya is

2318
02:33:35,540 --> 02:33:37,180
Just go straight and you'll see

2319
02:33:40,970 --> 02:33:42,730
You need to show some respect for us officers

2320
02:33:43,250 --> 02:33:44,660
You will be able to get on the freeway

2321
02:33:45,500 --> 02:33:46,800
Stop doing that

2322
02:33:47,880 --> 02:33:49,100
Ouch

2323
02:33:53,930 --> 02:33:55,790
Stop messing around in front of officers

2324
02:34:02,340 --> 02:34:03,510
Why is he back again ?

2325
02:34:05,270 --> 02:34:06,320
Don't come back

2326
02:34:09,320 --> 02:34:11,320
Easy on the gas pedal

2327
02:34:11,920 --> 02:34:13,300
Look, he's in neutral

2328
02:34:18,320 --> 02:34:19,120
Wait a minute

2329
02:34:19,170 --> 02:34:20,690
Are they waiting for us there ?

2330
02:34:21,030 --> 02:34:22,490
That car is a little suspicious

2331
02:34:23,280 --> 02:34:24,170
Suspicious ?

2332
02:34:24,650 --> 02:34:25,840
Let's walk over there

2333
02:34:26,340 --> 02:34:28,160
They obviously don't want to be checked

2334
02:34:28,770 --> 02:34:34,400
Suspicious Vehicle! Who's Inside ?!

2335
02:34:35,740 --> 02:34:37,170
Roll down the window, please ?

2336
02:34:38,500 --> 02:34:39,560
What's going on ?

2337
02:34:40,120 --> 02:34:41,180
He won't open it

2338
02:34:45,140 --> 02:34:52,480
Trashed
Hanako Yamada

2339
02:34:45,520 --> 02:34:47,520
Damn, you reek of booze !

2340
02:34:47,670 --> 02:34:48,660
She smells like alcohol !

2341
02:34:51,490 --> 02:34:52,630
Endo, get her out

2342
02:34:54,500 --> 02:34:55,850
Big sis, please

2343
02:34:56,090 --> 02:35:00,380
Endo: 15 years in business      Hanako: 19 years in business

2344
02:35:01,490 --> 02:35:02,360
Make sure you keep her safe

2345
02:35:02,520 --> 02:35:05,320
Carries Her to the Patrol Wagon

2346
02:35:06,380 --> 02:35:08,990
So they tell me that
there's plenty of good wines for me

2347
02:35:09,350 --> 02:35:12,200
But when I got there,
there was no wine opener

2348
02:35:12,670 --> 02:35:14,820
Of course, I couldn't open them without it

2349
02:35:15,250 --> 02:35:17,060
They made me wait more than an hour for one

2350
02:35:17,320 --> 02:35:18,350
What were you drinking ?

2351
02:35:18,230 --> 02:35:20,180
Did I say there was no wine opener ?

2352
02:35:20,360 --> 02:35:22,420
What do you do for living ?

2353
02:35:23,550 --> 02:35:26,970
I guess I'm an actress

2354
02:35:26,460 --> 02:35:27,520
She's an actress

2355
02:35:30,620 --> 02:35:31,470
But listen

2356
02:35:33,130 --> 02:35:34,980
What the hell are you doing ?!

2357
02:35:35,850 --> 02:35:37,350
Hamada san, please watch her

2358
02:35:38,720 --> 02:35:40,310
Sit tight

2359
02:35:40,710 --> 02:35:41,460
and stay put

2360
02:35:44,420 --> 02:35:46,080
There was no wine opener

2361
02:35:47,740 --> 02:35:48,730
We gotta watch her

2362
02:35:51,700 --> 02:35:52,890
We can watch her now

2363
02:35:52,920 --> 02:35:56,040
Please come back when you're done though

2364
02:35:58,850 --> 02:36:00,580
Anyway, who are you into these days ?

2365
02:36:01,070 --> 02:36:02,280
"Who am I into ?"

2366
02:36:02,910 --> 02:36:03,850
Well...

2367
02:36:04,540 --> 02:36:05,480
Who do you like these days ?

2368
02:36:04,670 --> 02:36:05,850
Well, he's more like...

2369
02:36:08,460 --> 02:36:09,330
Don't get up

2370
02:36:09,650 --> 02:36:10,710
Go ahead and lay down

2371
02:36:11,130 --> 02:36:12,230
Is this good ?

2372
02:36:16,520 --> 02:36:18,310
She was so ready to take her clothes off

2373
02:36:18,810 --> 02:36:19,920
So who exactly are you into ?

2374
02:36:20,260 --> 02:36:21,830
There's someone I admire

2375
02:36:26,400 --> 02:36:28,150
I told the Dress Coordinator

2376
02:36:28,510 --> 02:36:29,420
"Where's my belt ?"

2377
02:36:29,950 --> 02:36:31,840
He hands me this rope

2378
02:36:32,000 --> 02:36:33,640
That's no rope, it's a neck-tie

2379
02:36:34,580 --> 02:36:36,520
This doesn't do its job, see ?

2380
02:36:36,830 --> 02:36:38,260
Stop ! Stop !

2381
02:36:38,420 --> 02:36:43,880
Hanako Pulls Down Her Pants

2382
02:36:40,120 --> 02:36:41,490
She's outta control

2383
02:36:42,230 --> 02:36:43,840
Keep your pants on !

2384
02:36:46,040 --> 02:36:48,270
I've seen this on "COPS" before

2385
02:36:48,320 --> 02:36:50,820
Let's call for backup

2386
02:36:51,260 --> 02:36:52,800
Yes, we need some help here

2387
02:36:55,220 --> 02:37:00,320
Hanako Tries to Drag Hamada Back on the Van

2388
02:36:55,530 --> 02:36:56,740
No, no, no, no !!

2389
02:36:58,530 --> 02:36:59,210
Let him go

2390
02:36:59,710 --> 02:37:00,130
Let him go

2391
02:37:00,880 --> 02:37:01,500
Let go

2392
02:37:01,880 --> 02:37:02,630
Let go

2393
02:37:05,320 --> 02:37:06,420
That's a cute ring

2394
02:37:11,850 --> 02:37:13,370
What a sloppy drunk she is

2395
02:37:13,520 --> 02:37:15,370
Yes, I drank.. but I didn't drive

2396
02:37:15,860 --> 02:37:16,980
Good thing you didn't drive

2397
02:37:17,380 --> 02:37:18,140
You're OK

2398
02:37:21,090 --> 02:37:22,610
Not drunk driving is good but...

2399
02:37:23,100 --> 02:37:25,100
Sit tight right here

2400
02:37:25,210 --> 02:37:26,180
But you know I..

2401
02:37:26,260 --> 02:37:27,680
Listen, listen

2402
02:37:27,380 --> 02:37:32,380
Translation by Shibatabread

2403
02:37:28,700 --> 02:37:30,060
So I was

2404
02:37:30,460 --> 02:37:31,170
listen,

2405
02:37:33,290 --> 02:37:34,740
She had way too much to drink

2406
02:37:35,770 --> 02:37:39,100
She's one obnoxious drunk

2407
02:37:41,190 --> 02:37:45,780
It's already been 15 hours

2408
02:37:49,270 --> 02:37:51,700
After their rigorous training

2409
02:37:52,120 --> 02:37:54,750
The 3 prepare for sleep

2410
02:37:56,770 --> 02:37:57,410
But...

2411
02:37:58,000 --> 02:37:58,740
Here comes...

2412
02:38:04,580 --> 02:38:05,230
Hey

2413
02:38:07,160 --> 02:38:09,240
We're invited to a monthly get together

2414
02:38:09,850 --> 02:38:11,790
held by the prison inmates

2415
02:38:13,400 --> 02:38:15,820
These guys look forward to this event

2416
02:38:17,080 --> 02:38:17,680
so it'll be.....

2417
02:38:18,640 --> 02:38:19,910
a good time...

2418
02:38:20,470 --> 02:38:21,450
for sure

2419
02:38:23,000 --> 02:38:24,110
Let's show some support

2420
02:38:24,980 --> 02:38:32,030
Attend the "Fun"
Monthly Inmate Talent Show

2421
02:38:26,050 --> 02:38:28,140
After their bedtime interruption

2422
02:38:28,650 --> 02:38:30,530
they are escorted to the recreational room

2423
02:38:33,690 --> 02:38:38,170
How will the sleepy and tired trainees respond ??

2424
02:38:39,960 --> 02:38:43,250
Good evening !

2425
02:38:47,730 --> 02:38:50,430
Inmate# 256
Haranishi

2426
02:38:48,010 --> 02:38:49,080
Welcome to our monthly

2427
02:38:49,450 --> 02:38:50,880
"Talent Show" !!!!

2428
02:38:51,800 --> 02:38:52,890
What the hell is this ?

2429
02:38:55,540 --> 02:38:56,510
Without further adieu

2430
02:38:57,150 --> 02:38:58,550
Let's get going with the show

2431
02:38:58,580 --> 02:38:59,790
He's got one funny face

2432
02:39:03,380 --> 02:39:06,340
~ Two words "Oshiri" and "Chinko"

2433
02:39:06,760 --> 02:39:09,600
differ by one vowel ~

2434
02:39:10,210 --> 02:39:16,090
~ But the two words "Oshiri" and "Megane"

2435
02:39:17,400 --> 02:39:19,860
have no vowels in common ~

2436
02:39:20,280 --> 02:39:21,630
Makes no sense

2437
02:39:22,670 --> 02:39:24,030
Nobody laughed at that

2438
02:39:25,000 --> 02:39:26,240
It's kinda funny

2439
02:39:27,010 --> 02:39:28,960
I saw you laughing, Yamasaki

2440
02:39:29,910 --> 02:39:31,380
Your smile was obvious

2441
02:39:32,180 --> 02:39:33,520
Let me introduce our first contestant

2442
02:39:36,160 --> 02:39:38,400
They've been here for the past 12 years

2443
02:39:39,190 --> 02:39:41,430
for the organized burglary they committed

2444
02:39:41,430 --> 02:39:46,280
And they're about to be released in two weeks !

2445
02:39:46,530 --> 02:39:48,250
This might be the last we see of them

2446
02:39:48,610 --> 02:39:49,810
Let's hear it for them !

2447
02:39:56,820 --> 02:40:00,530
Inmate# 56 and 57
Red Yoshida and Golgo Matsumoto

2448
02:39:59,420 --> 02:40:00,910
Here's the king of the jungle...

2449
02:40:01,240 --> 02:40:01,990
A lion

2450
02:40:03,950 --> 02:40:05,590
You know he just woke up

2451
02:40:07,870 --> 02:40:09,970
I heard he was asleep up until he was called to do this

2452
02:40:18,250 --> 02:40:19,420
I thought this was funny

2453
02:40:20,280 --> 02:40:21,440
Next up is

2454
02:40:22,180 --> 02:40:24,570
a chimp doing sit-ups

2455
02:40:28,410 --> 02:40:29,270
OK, when you're ready

2456
02:40:30,780 --> 02:40:31,500
One

2457
02:40:32,790 --> 02:40:34,180
Two

2458
02:40:35,700 --> 02:40:36,750
Three

2459
02:40:38,340 --> 02:40:39,030
Four

2460
02:40:40,930 --> 02:40:41,530
Let's go

2461
02:40:41,830 --> 02:40:42,830
C'mon

2462
02:40:42,930 --> 02:40:44,850
How'd you not laugh at this ?

2463
02:40:44,130 --> 02:40:45,030
What's wrong ?

2464
02:40:45,540 --> 02:40:46,690
Alright, good job

2465
02:40:47,230 --> 02:40:48,230
You're bored ?

2466
02:40:48,480 --> 02:40:49,450
OK, then

2467
02:40:52,070 --> 02:40:54,320
Why don't we say thank you

2468
02:40:54,710 --> 02:40:56,190
to those who showed up tonight

2469
02:40:57,130 --> 02:40:57,740
Let's go

2470
02:41:01,740 --> 02:41:03,270
Esqueeze us

2471
02:41:03,530 --> 02:41:04,530
Thank you very much !!!!

2472
02:41:04,530 --> 02:41:07,030
THANK YOU VERY MUCH !!!!

2473
02:41:15,010 --> 02:41:16,920
I think all of you guys laughed

2474
02:41:18,330 --> 02:41:19,470
These sweat pants don't help

2475
02:41:21,650 --> 02:41:22,890
Here's a quick announcement

2476
02:41:23,210 --> 02:41:27,110
We unfortunately didn't get enough contestants this month

2477
02:41:28,150 --> 02:41:29,680
So why not you

2478
02:41:29,990 --> 02:41:30,760
do something for us ?

2479
02:41:31,260 --> 02:41:32,230
C'mon up to the stage

2480
02:41:34,430 --> 02:41:35,230
Your name ?

2481
02:41:35,530 --> 02:41:36,630
I'm Yoshimura

2482
02:41:36,370 --> 02:41:38,430
Inmate# 117
Yoshimura
(Heisei Nobushikobushi)

2483
02:41:37,430 --> 02:41:38,340
I can see you're ready to go

2484
02:41:39,700 --> 02:41:41,970
I can use my body as a musical instrument

2485
02:41:42,780 --> 02:41:43,640
Sounds good

2486
02:41:43,010 --> 02:41:46,530
Body Slapping Instrument

2487
02:41:45,200 --> 02:41:46,420
Let's give it up for him!

2488
02:41:47,740 --> 02:41:49,620
Here's a song by Naomi Amuro

2489
02:42:04,110 --> 02:42:06,590
Thank you very much !!

2490
02:42:12,350 --> 02:42:13,260
Damn...

2491
02:42:21,420 --> 02:42:22,710
You got any more for us ?

2492
02:42:22,630 --> 02:42:23,250
Of course

2493
02:42:24,050 --> 02:42:24,910
I have several more

2494
02:42:25,460 --> 02:42:26,260
You mind ?

2495
02:42:26,590 --> 02:42:27,680
I'd be happy to

2496
02:42:28,150 --> 02:42:28,800
Is that OK ?

2497
02:42:29,240 --> 02:42:30,420
Give us one more good one

2498
02:42:30,730 --> 02:42:32,660
Here's one of the classics

2499
02:42:32,830 --> 02:42:34,340
"If you're happy and you know it"

2500
02:42:34,480 --> 02:42:35,900
Anytime you're ready

2501
02:42:36,430 --> 02:42:37,650
~ If you're ~

2502
02:42:50,490 --> 02:42:52,250
Thank you so much

2503
02:42:58,380 --> 02:42:59,510
Not cool

2504
02:43:00,530 --> 02:43:01,830
I actually heard the melody

2505
02:43:04,980 --> 02:43:06,180
He did a good job

2506
02:43:08,820 --> 02:43:10,100
Where has the time gone ?

2507
02:43:10,960 --> 02:43:12,790
Here's our last act

2508
02:43:15,240 --> 02:43:17,930
She has been one of my mentors

2509
02:43:18,510 --> 02:43:20,770
here in prison for a while

2510
02:43:22,080 --> 02:43:23,520
She's become a monthly regular here

2511
02:43:37,880 --> 02:43:43,260
Inmate# 7
Mother of Haranishi / Tennessee Waltz

2512
02:44:05,330 --> 02:44:07,020
This concludes our monthly Talent Show

2513
02:44:07,240 --> 02:44:08,720
I'm looking forward to seeing you next month

2514
02:44:09,060 --> 02:44:10,550
Thank you so much for coming tonight !

2515
02:44:17,030 --> 02:44:18,350
The show ends

2516
02:44:18,750 --> 02:44:20,430
and it's already past 1am

2517
02:44:23,380 --> 02:44:25,290
Now it's really time for some sleep

2518
02:44:25,680 --> 02:44:32,680
But there's another trap set up...

2519
02:44:38,380 --> 02:44:45,490
Burdock underneath the comforter

2520
02:44:41,890 --> 02:44:43,280
That was creepy

2521
02:44:44,030 --> 02:44:45,090
That's a big one

2522
02:44:47,410 --> 02:44:49,290
Imagine getting slapped with that

2523
02:44:49,900 --> 02:44:51,460
This is the real thing

2524
02:44:55,220 --> 02:44:56,430
Let's get to bed

2525
02:45:03,100 --> 02:45:06,020
The burdock will come back to haunt them !!

2526
02:45:06,250 --> 02:45:08,370
But of course they have no idea

2527
02:45:11,480 --> 02:45:15,330
Finally, time for some sleep

2528
02:45:18,900 --> 02:45:22,420
Matsumoto and Tanaka plan late night schemes from behind the scenes

2529
02:45:22,920 --> 02:45:26,500
Let's make sure they're not awake

2530
02:45:27,060 --> 02:45:29,680
The 3 are about to be victims

2531
02:45:30,050 --> 02:45:32,270
of a midnight rude awakening

2532
02:45:41,730 --> 02:45:43,030
Tonight's crucial

2533
02:45:43,030 --> 02:45:50,480
Konyaga Yamada

2534
02:45:45,020 --> 02:45:48,180
Tonight's crucial

2535
02:45:48,440 --> 02:45:49,480
Tonight's   #$%^

2536
02:45:49,480 --> 02:45:50,980
Tonight's   #$%^

2537
02:45:52,930 --> 02:45:54,230
Tonight's crucial

2538
02:45:55,770 --> 02:45:57,380
Tonight's crucial

2539
02:45:58,360 --> 02:45:58,980
Tonight's crucial...fu

2540
02:45:58,980 --> 02:46:00,680
Tonight's crucial...fu

2541
02:46:05,240 --> 02:46:07,730
Why's he saying it like that ?!

2542
02:46:07,930 --> 02:46:09,930
What the hell is "Tonight's the peak...fu" ??

2543
02:46:19,300 --> 02:46:22,370
Tonight's crucial ??

2544
02:46:23,340 --> 02:46:25,510
Bookstore's crucial ?

2545
02:46:25,470 --> 02:46:26,760
Why "honya" ??

2546
02:46:27,680 --> 02:46:28,480
See ?

2547
02:46:27,760 --> 02:46:30,450
Bookstore's crucial

2548
02:46:30,450 --> 02:46:32,030
It's supposed to be "konya"

2549
02:46:36,080 --> 02:46:37,030
Why "Honya" ??

2550
02:46:37,530 --> 02:46:38,530
Listen close

2551
02:46:39,530 --> 02:46:41,030
Yeah, he's saying "honya" not "konya"

2552
02:46:43,530 --> 02:46:45,530
He's saying "honya"

2553
02:46:46,000 --> 02:46:48,710
Bookstore's crucial

2554
02:46:48,580 --> 02:46:51,020
You mean, "Konaya Ga Yamada" (tonight's crucial)

2555
02:46:50,500 --> 02:46:53,160
Bookstore's crucial

2556
02:46:55,580 --> 02:46:58,680
Bookstore's crucial

2557
02:47:03,840 --> 02:47:05,030
Give me a break

2558
02:47:05,530 --> 02:47:06,930
Hamada-san, you couldn't stop

2559
02:47:11,930 --> 02:47:13,960
Yamasaki, you were gone

2560
02:47:12,780 --> 02:47:14,980
Say "Tonight's crucial"

2561
02:47:15,700 --> 02:47:17,380
How could you guys sleep through that?

2562
02:47:20,430 --> 02:47:22,030
Show-hei Hey !!

2563
02:47:22,500 --> 02:47:31,740
Showfukutei Show-hei

2564
02:47:22,530 --> 02:47:31,540
Calling Showhei

2565
02:47:24,680 --> 02:47:25,330
Show-hei Hey !!

2566
02:47:25,330 --> 02:47:27,440
Show-hei Hey !!

2567
02:47:29,960 --> 02:47:30,970
Showhei HEY !!!

2568
02:47:33,690 --> 02:47:34,740
I was in deep trouble here

2569
02:47:36,730 --> 02:47:38,800
We definitely got Endo just then

2570
02:47:43,130 --> 02:47:43,880
This isn't good

2571
02:47:44,460 --> 02:47:45,660
Yama-chan, you were sleeping ?

2572
02:47:46,070 --> 02:47:47,170
I was completely out

2573
02:47:48,190 --> 02:47:51,080
Show-hei HEY !

2574
02:47:52,800 --> 02:47:53,350
Show-hei HEY !!

2575
02:47:53,350 --> 02:47:55,240
Show-hei HEY !!

2576
02:48:00,670 --> 02:48:01,630
We're doomed

2577
02:48:02,290 --> 02:48:03,430
We're in serious trouble

2578
02:48:05,760 --> 02:48:06,910
I can't fall asleep to this

2579
02:48:07,460 --> 02:48:08,340
How can I ?

2580
02:48:09,180 --> 02:48:10,640
The second yell gets me every time

2581
02:48:13,770 --> 02:48:16,760
Show-hei HEY !

2582
02:48:16,090 --> 02:48:17,260
I got past this one

2583
02:48:17,980 --> 02:48:18,730
But not the next one

2584
02:48:18,210 --> 02:48:19,030
Show-hei HEY !!

2585
02:48:19,030 --> 02:48:20,530
Show-hei HEY !!

2586
02:48:23,770 --> 02:48:24,970
It's when he raises his voice that's funny

2587
02:48:25,000 --> 02:48:26,680
That got me every time

2588
02:48:25,680 --> 02:48:26,450
This sucks

2589
02:48:31,870 --> 02:48:33,320
I can't get past that second yell

2590
02:48:33,320 --> 02:48:35,880
The second yell was too hard to resist

2591
02:48:35,880 --> 02:48:37,040
I can manage the first one but not the second

2592
02:48:39,130 --> 02:48:40,450
It's worse because we kept anticipating it

2593
02:48:44,530 --> 02:48:47,770
Go ahead, I won't laugh anymore

2594
02:48:44,770 --> 02:48:47,570
What's funny is Show-hei has nothing to do with this

2595
02:48:50,190 --> 02:48:52,460
Show-hei HEY !

2596
02:48:52,440 --> 02:48:53,630
That's just the set up

2597
02:48:56,060 --> 02:48:56,820
Show-hei HEY !!

2598
02:48:56,820 --> 02:48:58,370
Show-hei HEY !!

2599
02:49:01,330 --> 02:49:02,600
Damn it !!

2600
02:49:07,800 --> 02:49:09,750
It was really late and we were tired, too

2601
02:49:09,760 --> 02:49:11,370
We couldn't stop laughing

2602
02:49:12,090 --> 02:49:14,540
What the hell does Show-hei have to do with this anyhow ??

2603
02:49:14,990 --> 02:49:19,080
I see Yamasaki has completely tuned it out

2604
02:49:19,690 --> 02:49:21,550
But that's good for now

2605
02:49:23,010 --> 02:49:24,340
The only one sleeping

2606
02:49:25,310 --> 02:49:27,540
But not for long !

2607
02:49:28,470 --> 02:49:38,970
Face to Face Burdock Beatdown !!

2608
02:49:39,840 --> 02:49:41,410
That's hilarious you woke up to that!

2609
02:49:41,070 --> 02:49:47,310
Lifetime Arch Rival
Mori-man

2610
02:49:46,860 --> 02:49:47,950
You're kiddin' me

2611
02:49:48,600 --> 02:49:49,280
Wait a sec

2612
02:49:53,390 --> 02:49:55,290
How did "Show-hei" not wake you up ??

2613
02:50:07,300 --> 02:50:08,490
That looks painful

2614
02:50:11,040 --> 02:50:12,240
She doesn't care that I just woke up ?

2615
02:50:21,060 --> 02:50:22,620
Out of control

2616
02:50:33,170 --> 02:50:34,870
What a nightmare

2617
02:50:37,040 --> 02:50:38,350
What was that all about ?

2618
02:50:46,600 --> 02:50:48,410
I was hurting

2619
02:50:54,950 --> 02:50:56,920
Who ever thought she'd show up ?

2620
02:50:57,700 --> 02:50:59,920
She got you really good, Hosei-san

2621
02:51:01,170 --> 02:51:04,290
Well, I was in a deep sleep

2622
02:51:12,350 --> 02:51:18,270
Sonny Chiba

2623
02:51:12,690 --> 02:51:15,440
I'm announcing 2:00am from Los Angeles

2624
02:51:16,300 --> 02:51:17,870
I'm Sonny Chiba

2625
02:51:19,800 --> 02:51:21,200
What the...?

2626
02:51:27,220 --> 02:51:28,190
It is so late

2627
02:51:28,490 --> 02:51:29,200
It's past midnight

2628
02:51:31,520 --> 02:51:40,320
Analyzing the Mind of an Intelligent Criminal

2629
02:51:32,720 --> 02:51:36,480
This footage will show the mind analysis

2630
02:51:36,910 --> 02:51:40,390
of a notoriously intelligent criminal

2631
02:51:41,260 --> 02:51:47,100
Notoriously Intelligent Criminal
Jimmy Ohnishi

2632
02:51:42,270 --> 02:51:45,260
Perform SHIRITORI with only English words

2633
02:51:46,690 --> 02:51:47,940
In English ?

2634
02:51:48,640 --> 02:52:05,150
Q: SHIRITORI using English words

2635
02:52:03,280 --> 02:52:05,520
Damn, I didn't want to end the word that way

2636
02:52:10,620 --> 02:52:12,110
Nice, I made it through

2637
02:52:12,120 --> 02:52:14,620
Sucks you had to go through this well past midnight

2638
02:52:15,290 --> 02:52:16,610
Yes, we weren't expecting it

2639
02:52:23,710 --> 02:52:28,120
Describe the smell of the glass jar contents

2640
02:52:23,860 --> 02:53:20,500
Q: Open the jar and describe the smell

2641
02:52:29,050 --> 02:52:31,200
He's super-sensitive to smells

2642
02:52:31,800 --> 02:52:33,770
Man, I can already smell it

2643
02:52:46,690 --> 02:52:48,780
Explain what it smells like

2644
02:52:51,990 --> 02:52:52,470
What ?

2645
02:52:58,380 --> 02:52:59,820
It's like your grandpa's

2646
02:53:00,210 --> 02:53:02,500
Grandpa's worn-out sock being rubbed

2647
02:53:02,970 --> 02:53:05,430
Rubbed against the inside of a sneaker

2648
02:53:06,470 --> 02:53:09,760
and then wiping it on the inside of a toilet like this

2649
02:53:10,360 --> 02:53:13,440
So, your grandpa's worn-out sock is wiped

2650
02:53:13,890 --> 02:53:15,270
in sneakers

2651
02:53:15,690 --> 02:53:18,540
And you rub it and clean the toilet like this...

2652
02:53:29,650 --> 02:53:30,790
Just amazing

2653
02:53:38,610 --> 02:53:39,640
What's he saying ??

2654
02:53:40,530 --> 02:53:41,740
He's just rambling

2655
02:53:42,340 --> 02:53:44,370
He just kept speaking nonsense

2656
02:53:45,120 --> 02:53:46,260
What's with the sneakers ?

2657
02:53:47,620 --> 02:53:48,930
I don't know why he says "sneakers ?"

2658
02:53:50,070 --> 02:53:52,730
So your grandpa's worn socks are wiped and

2659
02:53:53,090 --> 02:53:56,590
then used to clean the toilet like this

2660
02:54:08,680 --> 02:54:11,660
His timing with the dry heave is impeccable

2661
02:54:12,250 --> 02:54:17,110
It's not easy watching Jimmy-san around this time of night

2662
02:54:17,560 --> 02:54:18,940
It's definitely a challenge

2663
02:54:19,690 --> 02:54:22,470
It was a complete surprise

2664
02:54:36,660 --> 02:54:41,120
It's been 22 hours since the start

2665
02:54:46,400 --> 02:54:47,840
Good morning

2666
02:54:48,250 --> 02:54:49,860
I brought you guys breakfast

2667
02:54:51,660 --> 02:54:52,550
Rise and shine

2668
02:54:54,490 --> 02:54:55,690
He thinks he's being funny ?

2669
02:54:55,830 --> 02:54:56,810
C'mon and wake up

2670
02:55:01,650 --> 02:55:02,970
Here's your breakfast

2671
02:55:03,300 --> 02:55:04,310
Man, it's cold

2672
02:55:06,750 --> 02:55:08,510
Being an good officer requires lots of energy

2673
02:55:08,850 --> 02:55:10,550
So don't skip your meal

2674
02:55:11,380 --> 02:55:12,450
After you're done eating

2675
02:55:12,900 --> 02:55:15,270
go ahead and get changed into your uniforms

2676
02:55:19,490 --> 02:55:20,320
Man, my ass hurts

2677
02:55:21,010 --> 02:55:23,380
My ass is killin'

2678
02:55:22,350 --> 02:55:23,480
Yes indeed

2679
02:55:24,280 --> 02:55:26,630
I'm actually hurting all over

2680
02:55:28,950 --> 02:55:31,920
How does this (belt) go ?

2681
02:55:30,940 --> 02:55:32,350
It's a bit tricky

2682
02:55:33,610 --> 02:55:34,860
How does it go ?

2683
02:55:39,010 --> 02:55:43,770
Yamasaki Tickles Endo

2684
02:55:41,960 --> 02:55:43,470
That wasn't cool

2685
02:55:44,080 --> 02:55:45,140
Wait a minute

2686
02:55:45,610 --> 02:55:46,990
You were obviously trying to make me laugh

2687
02:55:47,520 --> 02:55:48,550
What about your belt though ?

2688
02:55:51,870 --> 02:55:55,070
What the hell are you two doing at the crack of dawn ?

2689
02:55:56,490 --> 02:55:58,280
You're awful

2690
02:55:59,200 --> 02:56:00,900
Did you have to do that ?

2691
02:56:01,190 --> 02:56:01,860
Seriously

2692
02:56:05,210 --> 02:56:06,530
Why did you grab my crotch ?

2693
02:56:07,990 --> 02:56:09,020
I didn't, sir

2694
02:56:09,470 --> 02:56:11,060
You did, too

2695
02:56:11,400 --> 02:56:12,640
No, sir

2696
02:56:14,360 --> 02:56:16,670
Let me see your face ?

2697
02:56:17,100 --> 02:56:18,930
That's a liar's face

2698
02:56:31,070 --> 02:56:33,550
This is disturbing

2699
02:56:36,260 --> 02:56:37,690
You've got to bring this one...

2700
02:56:44,380 --> 02:56:45,610
What the hell are you doing ?

2701
02:56:47,970 --> 02:56:49,290
Give me a break

2702
02:56:52,790 --> 02:56:53,870
What'd you do now ?

2703
02:56:53,940 --> 02:56:55,280
I didn't do anything

2704
02:56:56,660 --> 02:57:00,040
That laugh does deserve a slap though

2705
02:57:05,010 --> 02:57:08,800
It's been 23 hours since the start

2706
02:57:12,970 --> 02:57:15,310
You guys did a good job over the last 24 hours

2707
02:57:15,620 --> 02:57:17,410
This concludes your training

2708
02:57:18,320 --> 02:57:24,950
Let's go outside for the commencement ceremony

2709
02:57:37,080 --> 02:57:42,470
Patrolling the Area
Officer Heipo

2710
02:57:37,980 --> 02:57:40,850
Don't forget to salute him

2711
02:58:09,750 --> 02:58:11,390
We gather today to acknowledge

2712
02:58:11,630 --> 02:58:12,800
Officer Masatoshi Hamada,

2713
02:58:12,930 --> 02:58:13,930
Officer Hosei Yamasaki,

2714
02:58:14,250 --> 02:58:15,370
and Officer Shozo Endo

2715
02:58:15,430 --> 02:58:20,200
for completing their training

2716
02:58:20,800 --> 02:58:24,810
Shakure Police Station
Training Commencement

2717
02:58:25,230 --> 02:58:30,210
Mr. Mikawa is here from the Juvenile Division to extend his congratulations

2718
02:58:30,520 --> 02:58:34,480
Program 1
Congratulations from the Juvenile Dept. Manager

2719
02:58:41,300 --> 02:58:43,030
Good morning to you all

2720
02:58:44,850 --> 02:58:53,480
Thick Northeastern Dialect

2721
02:58:45,730 --> 02:58:51,130
Congratulations to the three trainees who successfully completed their training

2722
02:58:55,000 --> 02:58:59,300
I can never find the right words for this type of occasion

2723
02:59:00,360 --> 02:59:04,470
So I thought I'd share some of my personal stories

2724
02:59:06,090 --> 02:59:10,770
First, let me tell you that I am the man
who I am because of the environment I grew up in

2725
02:59:11,100 --> 02:59:13,740
I actually have three older sisters

2726
02:59:14,080 --> 02:59:19,710
And I know that my father really wanted a son of his own...#$$%%

2727
02:59:20,210 --> 02:59:28,930
<Indiscernible>

2728
02:59:31,880 --> 02:59:33,710
What exactly is he saying ?

2729
02:59:37,740 --> 02:59:51,780
<Indiscernible>

2730
02:59:56,100 --> 02:59:57,330
What's this about ?

2731
02:59:58,130 --> 03:00:00,470
It's his autobiography

2732
02:59:59,260 --> 03:00:00,330
Is that so ?

2733
03:00:04,330 --> 03:00:09,510
<Indescernible>

2734
03:00:10,060 --> 03:00:13,460
I hope you can take something from this story
as you graduate today

2735
03:00:13,910 --> 03:00:14,940
Congratulations

2736
03:00:18,210 --> 03:00:19,640
With that we conclude

2737
03:00:20,050 --> 03:00:22,650
the graduation ceremony !

2738
03:00:23,310 --> 03:00:23,930
Officers

2739
03:00:24,260 --> 03:00:25,450

You have become what you always wanted to be as a children

2748
03:01:00,740 --> 03:01:08,090
But you haven't fulfilled your hopes or dreams

2749
03:01:09,290 --> 03:01:15,830
at this hellish police station

2750
03:01:17,250 --> 03:01:21,880
You leave with pain in your buttocks...

2751
03:01:23,090 --> 03:01:27,540

Thank you

2758
03:01:50,690 --> 03:01:51,890
Once you cross that gate,

2759
03:01:52,260 --> 03:01:53,310
The Batsu Game is officially over

2760
03:01:54,110 --> 03:01:54,710
Shall we ?

2761
03:01:56,690 --> 03:01:58,060
What a long day

2762
03:02:01,280 --> 03:02:02,430
Is this the chief's name written on here ?

2763
03:02:02,840 --> 03:02:03,960
Yes, I believe so

2764
03:02:03,980 --> 03:02:06,380
He wasn't here for the commencement though

2765
03:02:07,350 --> 03:02:08,140
What ?

2766
03:02:09,050 --> 03:02:12,380

One left out cigarette~

2769

..........

2770
03:02:34,760 --> 03:02:35,690
He still didn't get it

2771
03:02:38,240 --> 03:02:39,460
Why can't he get this song ?

2772
03:02:40,030 --> 03:02:41,040
Very irritating

2773
03:02:41,690 --> 03:02:42,820
Can you memorize more than just a line ?

2774
03:02:43,520 --> 03:02:44,440
Just a couple of more

2775
03:02:50,420 --> 03:02:51,580
What's with this editing ?

2776
03:02:52,580 --> 03:02:53,380
Thanks for everything

2777
03:02:54,380 --> 03:02:55,180
Alright !

2778
03:02:54,880 --> 03:02:56,320
We're done

2779
03:02:59,200 --> 03:03:00,160
That was a long day

2780
03:03:00,630 --> 03:03:01,460
Very long

2781
03:03:02,140 --> 03:03:04,110
You just disrespected Hamada-san

2782
03:03:07,280 --> 03:03:08,280
Why not just laugh it off ?

2783
03:03:08,760 --> 03:03:09,650
We're graduates !!

2784
03:03:14,120 --> 03:03:15,720
Laughing is good for our souls

2785
03:03:19,160 --> 03:03:20,790
OK, that was amazing

2786
03:03:23,080 --> 03:03:25,370
Yama-chan, how could you have slept through that ?

2787
03:03:27,410 --> 03:03:29,370
I was really beat that night

2788
03:03:29,730 --> 03:03:31,550
You didn't hear the "Show-hei" calls ?

2789
03:03:33,080 --> 03:03:34,180
You know what ?

2790
03:03:34,380 --> 03:03:36,180
I have no recollection of it

2791
03:03:39,750 --> 03:03:40,790
That was hilarious

2792
03:03:42,000 --> 03:03:44,070
I feel bad not paying Show-hei san for this

2793
03:03:44,650 --> 03:03:46,100
We abused his name way too much

2794
03:03:46,760 --> 03:03:48,370
He's not even on the show

2795
03:03:50,580 --> 03:03:54,140
You know people will tell him how great he was on this show

2796
03:03:54,620 --> 03:03:55,620
and he'll be like, "What show ?"

2797
03:03:56,170 --> 03:03:57,340
He'll be puzzled

2798
03:04:00,150 --> 03:04:01,060
Lots of excitement

2799
03:04:01,430 --> 03:04:02,290
Yes, a lot of it

2800
03:04:02,780 --> 03:04:04,900
Watching this whole thing made me remember that day

2801
03:04:05,690 --> 03:04:07,310
and it made me exhausted

2802
03:04:07,550 --> 03:04:08,450
Are you done ?

2803
03:04:10,670 --> 03:04:12,590
It made you exhausted AND ???

2804
03:04:15,000 --> 03:04:15,890
That's not fair

2805
03:04:16,850 --> 03:04:19,130
Of course, I can't come up with anything !

2806
03:04:20,280 --> 03:04:21,330
Don't do that to me

2807
03:04:21,380 --> 03:04:26,380
