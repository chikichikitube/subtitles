1
00:00:00,300 --> 00:00:02,830
Second time on Gaki no Tsukai Ya Arahende!

2
00:00:02,830 --> 00:00:06,510
Let's play with table games from around the world!!

3
00:00:08,110 --> 00:00:08,910
For the 2nd time

4
00:00:08,910 --> 00:00:09,680
Yeah

5
00:00:09,680 --> 00:00:10,300
Second round

6
00:00:10,160 --> 00:00:14,100
Downtown

7
00:00:10,160 --> 00:00:14,100
Hamada Masatoshi

8
00:00:10,160 --> 00:00:14,100
Matsumoto Hitoshi

9
00:00:10,300 --> 00:00:12,720
At the end I'm glad we're doing this

10
00:00:12,720 --> 00:00:14,720
The one I don't want to do anymore

11
00:00:14,720 --> 00:00:17,600
Is Yoshimoto's New Comedy

12
00:00:17,600 --> 00:00:19,300
Never again on that

13
00:00:18,270 --> 00:00:21,010
Cocorico

14
00:00:18,270 --> 00:00:21,010
Endo Shozo

15
00:00:18,270 --> 00:00:21,010
Tanaka Naoki

16
00:00:19,300 --> 00:00:20,840
Come on, we had fun

17
00:00:20,840 --> 00:00:21,690
Even the ratings for it were terribly bad

18
00:00:21,690 --> 00:00:23,390
Even the ratings for it were terribly bad

19
00:00:23,390 --> 00:00:24,740
Really?   - Is that so?

20
00:00:23,390 --> 00:00:25,620
Tsukitei Housei

21
00:00:24,740 --> 00:00:25,680
Yes   - Oh

22
00:00:25,950 --> 00:00:26,820
That's our second time

23
00:00:26,820 --> 00:00:27,910
It is

24
00:00:27,910 --> 00:00:29,290
This time too, Tanaka-kun will...

25
00:00:29,290 --> 00:00:31,620
Tanaka is really good at explaining them

26
00:00:32,170 --> 00:00:34,400
That's because I got there 1 hour before you

27
00:00:32,390 --> 00:00:36,920
Tanaka understood and learned the rules beforehand from an expert

28
00:00:34,400 --> 00:00:37,600
So I make sure to spend my time learning the rules

29
00:00:37,500 --> 00:00:39,940
He's still feeling down about his divorce

30
00:00:40,340 --> 00:00:41,710
It still hits him hard

31
00:00:41,710 --> 00:00:43,050
By now it's been a year

32
00:00:43,050 --> 00:00:44,480
One year?   - Has passed, yes

33
00:00:44,480 --> 00:00:45,950
He's carrying the wound

34
00:00:46,430 --> 00:00:51,090
I bet he's saying to his younger colleagues "I'll get over it in 3 years"

35
00:00:49,500 --> 00:00:51,900
I'm saying I'm ok!   - His wounds are deep

36
00:00:52,650 --> 00:01:00,630

39
00:01:00,890 --> 00:01:09,070
Let's play with table games from around the world~!!

40
00:01:00,890 --> 00:01:09,070
Play with the game which caught your attention between

41
00:01:00,890 --> 00:01:09,070
note: voice = same as black text

42
00:01:00,890 --> 00:01:09,070
the selected ones from around the world!!

43
00:01:09,140 --> 00:01:11,400
I was thinking that uhm...

44
00:01:11,400 --> 00:01:18,720
Giving that Hamada is here with us

45
00:01:13,800 --> 00:01:14,670
I think we can't really play the brainy ones

46
00:01:14,670 --> 00:01:17,040
I think we can't really play the brainy ones

47
00:01:17,040 --> 00:01:18,720
I think we can't really play the brainy ones

48
00:01:18,120 --> 00:01:18,890
Easy ones?

49
00:01:19,590 --> 00:01:20,390
He's a simpleton

50
00:01:20,390 --> 00:01:21,040
Is he?

51
00:01:21,040 --> 00:01:22,080
He is

52
00:01:22,700 --> 00:01:29,390
Deja V첫 - Germany

53
00:01:22,700 --> 00:01:29,390
Get the piece when the same picture appears twice!

54
00:01:23,290 --> 00:01:26,370
The first game Tanaka chose

55
00:01:26,370 --> 00:01:28,370
Is "Deja-v첫", from Germany

56
00:01:29,440 --> 00:01:30,510
So, the first one is this

57
00:01:30,510 --> 00:01:33,210
We'll start with the made-in-Germany game "Deja-v첫"

58
00:01:31,310 --> 00:01:31,680
Yes

59
00:01:32,450 --> 00:01:32,950
Deja-v첫

60
00:01:33,210 --> 00:01:34,750
Long story short

61
00:01:34,350 --> 00:01:34,720
Yes?

62
00:01:34,760 --> 00:01:41,160
When you think the same picture appears for a second time

63
00:01:37,170 --> 00:01:41,160
You have to take its illustration, It's a memory game

64
00:01:39,790 --> 00:01:41,160
Ahh, that kind of game

65
00:01:41,160 --> 00:01:44,770
Yes, as you can see there are several items here

66
00:01:44,770 --> 00:01:46,940
For example, I flip the card and got this

67
00:01:46,940 --> 00:01:47,310
Yes

68
00:01:47,310 --> 00:01:50,050
You can see this one has a compass and a lipstick

69
00:01:48,550 --> 00:01:48,910
Yes

70
00:01:49,150 --> 00:01:50,050
Alright, I see

71
00:01:50,050 --> 00:01:52,000
If these appear for a second time

72
00:01:52,000 --> 00:01:54,900
For example if another lipstick appear, you grab its piece

73
00:01:54,460 --> 00:01:54,900
Ok

74
00:01:54,900 --> 00:01:56,800
New items appear one after the other

75
00:01:55,900 --> 00:01:57,060
I see...

76
00:01:56,800 --> 00:01:58,200
So you have to remember them

77
00:01:58,200 --> 00:01:59,630
You see there's a duck here, right?

78
00:01:59,630 --> 00:02:02,520
So if another one appears like this, you must take it

79
00:02:02,520 --> 00:02:03,980
I see, I see, I see    - Alright

80
00:02:03,980 --> 00:02:04,610
Got it

81
00:02:04,610 --> 00:02:06,080
This is pretty hard

82
00:02:05,780 --> 00:02:06,700
Whoever fails this will be banned from entering Nippon TV

83
00:02:06,700 --> 00:02:11,070
Whoever fails this will be banned from entering Nippon TV

84
00:02:07,750 --> 00:02:08,690
Really?

85
00:02:08,690 --> 00:02:09,930
Is it that serious?

86
00:02:09,930 --> 00:02:11,200
As a bet?

87
00:02:11,200 --> 00:02:13,740
Who takes the wrong one will be disqualified

88
00:02:13,740 --> 00:02:17,040
If that happens, he can't play the next rounds anymore

89
00:02:15,050 --> 00:02:16,530
He can't join?   - He's out

90
00:02:17,700 --> 00:02:19,090
That's pretty harsh

91
00:02:19,090 --> 00:02:20,580
Are you ok with the rules?    - Yes

92
00:02:20,580 --> 00:02:22,350
It's kinda like Concentration

93
00:02:22,350 --> 00:02:23,720
Shall we go then?   - Ok Tanaka

94
00:02:23,720 --> 00:02:24,250
Alright

95
00:02:25,650 --> 00:02:27,350
Suddenly three items

96
00:02:27,350 --> 00:02:27,960
Endo-san

97
00:02:28,160 --> 00:02:28,530
Ok

98
00:02:28,930 --> 00:02:30,730
Here I go, they may appear right now

99
00:02:32,330 --> 00:02:34,070
W-wait I'm already...

100
00:02:37,280 --> 00:02:39,510
What the hell? I have no idea
- They're all different

101
00:02:41,820 --> 00:02:42,920
And this one

102
00:02:44,050 --> 00:02:47,270
Did they really appear before?

103
00:02:45,490 --> 00:02:47,400
This one I'm sure...    - Yeah it did

104
00:02:47,270 --> 00:02:49,300
We can't look at them now, right?

105
00:02:48,330 --> 00:02:49,400
At the moment

106
00:02:49,400 --> 00:02:51,340
We can't, we can look at them later

107
00:02:49,480 --> 00:02:50,170
We can't?

108
00:02:50,170 --> 00:02:51,340
We can't look at them now!?

109
00:02:51,340 --> 00:02:53,270
So we can check if we got them right later...

110
00:02:53,660 --> 00:02:56,380
Been drawn a second time

111
00:02:53,660 --> 00:02:56,380
If the lipstick hasn't

112
00:02:56,380 --> 00:02:58,910
The lipstick is somewhere in the deck

113
00:02:56,380 --> 00:02:58,910
Then it means

114
00:02:57,920 --> 00:02:58,750
That's right

115
00:02:58,910 --> 00:03:00,710
Is drawn again from the deck

116
00:02:58,910 --> 00:03:00,710
So if the lipstick

117
00:03:00,710 --> 00:03:02,250
You already took it, so you're disqualified

118
00:03:02,250 --> 00:03:05,120
You already took it, so you're disqualified

119
00:03:02,740 --> 00:03:03,160
I see

120
00:03:03,160 --> 00:03:05,120
You took this thinking it appeared twice?

121
00:03:05,670 --> 00:03:06,740
Yeah, it did

122
00:03:06,740 --> 00:03:08,570
Ok, so we'll know it later    - Yes, later

123
00:03:08,570 --> 00:03:09,740
What!? For real!?

124
00:03:09,710 --> 00:03:17,020
note: the kanji over the boxes are their names. Just keep the usual colors in mind: Housei, Matsumoto, Hamada, Endo, Tanaka

125
00:03:09,740 --> 00:03:10,580
Housei-san   - Flip it

126
00:03:13,110 --> 00:03:14,410
These are new

127
00:03:14,410 --> 00:03:16,020
Stack them up properly    - Ok

128
00:03:20,630 --> 00:03:22,170
I'm 100% sure on this

129
00:03:25,640 --> 00:03:26,470
This is new

130
00:03:26,470 --> 00:03:28,140
Maybe you should stand up

131
00:03:29,110 --> 00:03:30,240
This one is reappearing

132
00:03:30,680 --> 00:03:31,120
Alright

133
00:03:31,240 --> 00:03:32,020
That was it

134
00:03:32,620 --> 00:03:33,370
Or maybe I'm wrong

135
00:03:33,370 --> 00:03:35,570
You have no idea yourself?

136
00:03:36,320 --> 00:03:38,530
We don't know if that came out or not

137
00:03:38,530 --> 00:03:39,200
That's right

138
00:03:41,700 --> 00:03:42,040
Huh?

139
00:03:44,380 --> 00:03:46,180
Who took it first?    - Yama-chan

140
00:03:46,180 --> 00:03:47,320
He's fast

141
00:03:50,050 --> 00:03:52,060
Lipstick

142
00:03:50,120 --> 00:03:51,960
The lipstick!    - Alright!

143
00:03:52,420 --> 00:03:56,270
See? The lipstick hasn't been drawn before

144
00:03:54,000 --> 00:03:55,700
Yes, this is its debut

145
00:03:56,420 --> 00:03:58,740
You're out

146
00:03:57,120 --> 00:03:57,780
Alright!

147
00:03:58,980 --> 00:04:00,540
Even though I got that many?!    - Yeah

148
00:03:59,210 --> 00:04:01,370
Housei: Disqualified

149
00:04:00,540 --> 00:04:02,110
You're out

150
00:04:02,130 --> 00:04:03,140
Nippon TV isn't enough, you're banned from Kojimachi now

151
00:04:02,130 --> 00:04:06,880
note: Nippon TV headquarters used to be in Kojimachi until 2004

152
00:04:03,140 --> 00:04:06,880
Nippon TV isn't enough, you're banned from Kojimachi now

153
00:04:05,330 --> 00:04:06,880
The area is widening!

154
00:04:07,130 --> 00:04:08,590
The area suddenly got wider

155
00:04:08,990 --> 00:04:10,100
It didn't appear before!

156
00:04:10,100 --> 00:04:10,700
Yeah it didn't

157
00:04:10,700 --> 00:04:12,350
You know why I took it?

158
00:04:12,350 --> 00:04:16,550
'Cause I've memorized it when you were explaining the game!

159
00:04:14,400 --> 00:04:16,550
You know what pisses me off?

160
00:04:17,240 --> 00:04:19,320
This guy who mistook the lipstick

161
00:04:19,320 --> 00:04:21,750
Got in my way so many friggin' times!

162
00:04:21,750 --> 00:04:23,240
If he wasn't here!

163
00:04:23,000 --> 00:04:23,930
He got them from you?

164
00:04:23,240 --> 00:04:24,860
If he wasn't even born in this world!

165
00:04:24,860 --> 00:04:28,030
I could have got tons of those!!

166
00:04:26,730 --> 00:04:28,800
I think you're taking it too far

167
00:04:28,030 --> 00:04:30,430
If only his parent weren't born!

168
00:04:29,630 --> 00:04:31,300
Come on, man

169
00:04:30,430 --> 00:04:32,440
It would have been better not to meet him at all !!

170
00:04:31,300 --> 00:04:32,340
You're exaggerating

171
00:04:32,740 --> 00:04:34,240
Such an asshole

172
00:04:35,210 --> 00:04:37,620
Anyway, he's out and can't take part in it anymore

173
00:04:37,620 --> 00:04:39,150
At this point I don't remember anything

174
00:04:39,150 --> 00:04:40,090
Yeah me neither...

175
00:04:40,090 --> 00:04:41,660
Let's try to move on a bit

176
00:04:42,560 --> 00:04:43,950
This was took    - This too

177
00:04:43,950 --> 00:04:46,170
This too   - He took the axe too

178
00:04:46,470 --> 00:04:51,190
He's really getting in our way!!

179
00:04:48,930 --> 00:04:50,580
Even though only one was drawn

180
00:04:50,580 --> 00:04:51,490
That can't be!

181
00:04:51,190 --> 00:04:53,080
He just took a non-existing lipstick

182
00:04:53,080 --> 00:04:56,430
And made sure to always get in our friggin' way!

183
00:04:55,220 --> 00:04:56,520
He's right, he's right

184
00:04:57,280 --> 00:05:00,030
I bet if he didn't do rakugo at all

185
00:05:00,030 --> 00:05:04,300
Everyone would enjoy rakugo so much!

186
00:05:03,600 --> 00:05:04,610
Are you for real?

187
00:05:04,610 --> 00:05:06,940
He's the root of all evil

188
00:05:06,940 --> 00:05:08,450
Really? Really!?

189
00:05:08,450 --> 00:05:09,580
Why?

190
00:05:09,580 --> 00:05:11,580
Line them up good

191
00:05:11,580 --> 00:05:12,590
Alright, I'm going

192
00:05:15,030 --> 00:05:15,760
This...

193
00:05:15,760 --> 00:05:16,590
Oh, right

194
00:05:16,590 --> 00:05:17,430
No doubts, right?

195
00:05:17,430 --> 00:05:18,260
I think so

196
00:05:18,260 --> 00:05:19,000
This--- ah!

197
00:05:19,000 --> 00:05:20,140
This one too!

198
00:05:20,140 --> 00:05:21,600
Oh that one    - Could be...

199
00:05:21,840 --> 00:05:22,470
Was it so?

200
00:05:23,170 --> 00:05:24,580
Huh?   - Wha-?

201
00:05:24,380 --> 00:05:24,680
Woah! That's embarrassing!

202
00:05:24,680 --> 00:05:27,520
Woah! That's embarrassing!

203
00:05:27,520 --> 00:05:28,320
The root of evil showed up!

204
00:05:28,320 --> 00:05:30,590
The root of evil showed up!

205
00:05:29,320 --> 00:05:30,090
What the hell!

206
00:05:30,690 --> 00:05:32,490
This was at the very beginning!

207
00:05:32,490 --> 00:05:33,190
You're wrong

208
00:05:33,190 --> 00:05:34,690
We got this first, right?!

209
00:05:34,690 --> 00:05:36,940
No, it's here    - It can't be, there are two here

210
00:05:35,020 --> 00:05:38,630
Matsumoto: Disqualified

211
00:05:36,940 --> 00:05:37,530
That's right

212
00:05:37,530 --> 00:05:38,640
This   - That one

213
00:05:38,640 --> 00:05:40,440
Keep in mind there are two of them

214
00:05:41,160 --> 00:05:44,940
That's cause I have one of these at home

215
00:05:43,450 --> 00:05:44,180
There he goes

216
00:05:44,180 --> 00:05:45,020
Come on, Tanaka

217
00:05:45,850 --> 00:05:48,000
There are way too many by now

218
00:05:48,000 --> 00:05:48,790
These are all new

219
00:05:48,790 --> 00:05:51,700
Geez...   - Three?   - Yes, there are three of us

220
00:05:54,630 --> 00:05:55,910
That's how it's going

221
00:05:55,910 --> 00:05:57,390
Looks like it

222
00:05:57,040 --> 00:06:00,590
Only those who tried have lost

223
00:05:58,810 --> 00:05:59,910
You're right, you're right

224
00:06:00,590 --> 00:06:02,620
Only the idiots are left

225
00:06:01,690 --> 00:06:02,590
That's true!

226
00:06:02,620 --> 00:06:04,820
Idiot leftovers!

227
00:06:04,820 --> 00:06:06,430
Idiot leftovers!

228
00:06:06,810 --> 00:06:07,900
That's a bit---

229
00:06:07,650 --> 00:06:08,800
Shut your trap!!

230
00:06:08,800 --> 00:06:11,470
Can you please be silent?

231
00:06:09,630 --> 00:06:11,230
Can you please shut up?

232
00:06:11,230 --> 00:06:14,010
The dumbest ones have it best    - We can't concentrate

233
00:06:14,010 --> 00:06:14,920
Right, right

234
00:06:15,250 --> 00:06:16,310
This is reappearing

235
00:06:16,310 --> 00:06:17,420
Are you sure?!

236
00:06:17,420 --> 00:06:18,080
This one too

237
00:06:18,080 --> 00:06:19,890
You didn't take a single one

238
00:06:18,450 --> 00:06:19,890
You sure?

239
00:06:19,890 --> 00:06:21,520
Hamada-san didn't take any

240
00:06:24,100 --> 00:06:25,100
That one    - This

241
00:06:25,100 --> 00:06:27,000
No way!    - This one for sure

242
00:06:27,000 --> 00:06:28,240
This one too, right?

243
00:06:28,240 --> 00:06:29,540
For real?

244
00:06:29,540 --> 00:06:31,510
I remember it...

245
00:06:34,130 --> 00:06:36,020
Wha-?    - It's there!

246
00:06:34,410 --> 00:06:37,660
The guitar too!

247
00:06:36,020 --> 00:06:38,120
Talking about getting in the way!

248
00:06:38,120 --> 00:06:40,530
Matsumoto-san surely did get in our way

249
00:06:40,530 --> 00:06:43,530
This one was there, it was, it was

250
00:06:43,530 --> 00:06:44,400
We all

251
00:06:44,400 --> 00:06:47,070
We all suck at this

252
00:06:45,170 --> 00:06:46,610
We're all screwing this up

253
00:06:47,100 --> 00:06:48,010
It won't last long

254
00:06:48,550 --> 00:06:49,230
Banana

255
00:06:49,230 --> 00:06:50,580
This one too

256
00:06:50,790 --> 00:06:52,740
Hamada-san is not taking anything

257
00:06:51,990 --> 00:06:52,690
Hamada?

258
00:06:52,690 --> 00:06:53,820
I'm afraid he'll...

259
00:06:53,830 --> 00:06:55,110
If Hamada-san wins this game is a fraud

260
00:06:55,110 --> 00:06:56,740
If Hamada-san wins this game is a fraud

261
00:06:56,740 --> 00:06:59,750
If Hamada-san wins this game is a fraud

262
00:06:57,800 --> 00:06:59,730
Yeah it would suck so bad

263
00:06:59,730 --> 00:07:01,430
The guy who did nothing would win

264
00:07:02,170 --> 00:07:02,710
Oh, this one--!

265
00:07:02,710 --> 00:07:03,800
It was there

266
00:07:03,800 --> 00:07:06,050
That's right, ok, Endo

267
00:07:03,970 --> 00:07:05,980
Endo disqualified!

268
00:07:06,610 --> 00:07:07,950
Alright! It's me and Hamada-san

269
00:07:07,950 --> 00:07:09,050
Alright

270
00:07:09,050 --> 00:07:11,060
This--- Wait a moment

271
00:07:11,060 --> 00:07:11,890
This--

272
00:07:11,880 --> 00:07:12,760
Why is this guy a victory candidate, huh!?

273
00:07:12,760 --> 00:07:14,130
Why is this guy a victory candidate, huh!?

274
00:07:14,130 --> 00:07:17,900
He didn't do anything at all !!

275
00:07:15,800 --> 00:07:17,170
What the hell!

276
00:07:17,940 --> 00:07:20,180
He managed to get to the last round

277
00:07:18,870 --> 00:07:19,940
That's messed up!

278
00:07:20,180 --> 00:07:22,080
All he did was flippin' cards!

279
00:07:22,080 --> 00:07:23,820
I've been waiting

280
00:07:23,820 --> 00:07:25,550
At least I didn't get wrong ones

281
00:07:25,830 --> 00:07:28,710
Is that the type of country Germany is?

282
00:07:28,710 --> 00:07:31,680
Wasn't it supposed to be a more aggressive country...?

283
00:07:30,740 --> 00:07:32,100
You rushed too much!

284
00:07:32,100 --> 00:07:33,880
If you don't take your time you may be out

285
00:07:33,880 --> 00:07:36,180
So it's ok to wait according to rules

286
00:07:35,040 --> 00:07:35,910
Is that so?

287
00:07:36,180 --> 00:07:37,010
Ok, here I go

288
00:07:38,010 --> 00:07:38,550
Here

289
00:07:38,550 --> 00:07:39,210
That one

290
00:07:39,210 --> 00:07:41,080
I already saw this, yes

291
00:07:39,540 --> 00:07:41,080
The key... oh right

292
00:07:41,080 --> 00:07:41,550
See?

293
00:07:43,200 --> 00:07:43,760
This too

294
00:07:44,120 --> 00:07:45,260
Yeah, it was there

295
00:07:45,260 --> 00:07:45,590
Sure?

296
00:07:45,590 --> 00:07:47,590
There are no words for this

297
00:07:48,260 --> 00:07:50,640
That one is reappearing, I remember it

298
00:07:50,450 --> 00:07:52,160
Hamada-san?

299
00:07:52,160 --> 00:07:55,500
Hamada-san are you

300
00:07:52,160 --> 00:07:55,500
ok empty-handed?

301
00:07:55,480 --> 00:07:57,180
Hamada-san?

302
00:07:57,180 --> 00:07:58,350
What's wrong?

303
00:07:59,650 --> 00:08:01,420
I think that one's wrong

304
00:08:00,890 --> 00:08:01,790
Are you ok?

305
00:08:01,790 --> 00:08:03,790
There aren't many cards left

306
00:08:01,800 --> 00:08:05,040
The cards are going to finish soon

307
00:08:05,830 --> 00:08:07,780
I already saw this!

308
00:08:07,340 --> 00:08:08,240
I think so too

309
00:08:08,840 --> 00:08:10,380
He finally got his first one

310
00:08:10,380 --> 00:08:11,100
The mask, yes

311
00:08:11,100 --> 00:08:12,510
Is it reappearing?     - It is

312
00:08:13,080 --> 00:08:13,620
Last one

313
00:08:13,620 --> 00:08:14,970
This too    - That too?

314
00:08:14,970 --> 00:08:15,730
So

315
00:08:15,730 --> 00:08:19,010
They all came out, only three cards are left

316
00:08:19,110 --> 00:08:25,090
With the 3 remaning cards they'll check if they make mistakes

317
00:08:19,610 --> 00:08:20,800
We'll verify our guesses now

318
00:08:20,800 --> 00:08:22,550
That's why you left these three?    - Yes

319
00:08:22,550 --> 00:08:23,030
Oh

320
00:08:23,420 --> 00:08:25,090
So you check them?    - We'll check them

321
00:08:25,490 --> 00:08:29,570
You're screwed if (the pieces you took) are on these 3 cards

322
00:08:27,200 --> 00:08:28,020
That's right

323
00:08:28,020 --> 00:08:30,220
Tanaka's position is more unfavorable    - Right

324
00:08:30,220 --> 00:08:31,020
I'm still on it

325
00:08:31,020 --> 00:08:32,690
You took a load of them

326
00:08:32,690 --> 00:08:34,460
Yeah but I'm probably sure about them

327
00:08:35,190 --> 00:08:36,460
A hat...    - These are the 3 cards

328
00:08:37,700 --> 00:08:38,460
Huh?

329
00:08:39,560 --> 00:08:40,970
Tanaka...      - Huh?

330
00:08:40,970 --> 00:08:41,930
The glasses    - Glasses

331
00:08:41,930 --> 00:08:42,670
The glasses...

332
00:08:42,670 --> 00:08:44,440
They didn't appear before    - Yeah...

333
00:08:44,870 --> 00:08:45,670
This one too

334
00:08:45,670 --> 00:08:46,730
The clock too

335
00:08:46,730 --> 00:08:47,640
The clock

336
00:08:48,110 --> 00:08:49,410
So it means that...?

337
00:08:49,410 --> 00:08:50,240
Who won?

338
00:08:50,240 --> 00:08:50,950
Hamada-san

339
00:08:51,040 --> 00:08:55,420
Hamada Wins

340
00:08:53,010 --> 00:08:54,650
What the hell is this?

341
00:08:54,650 --> 00:08:55,610
Yeah what the hell?

342
00:08:55,610 --> 00:08:57,380
This wasn't fun at all

343
00:08:57,120 --> 00:08:59,290
The person who didn't take part in just won !!

344
00:08:59,290 --> 00:09:02,700
But in the end the few I took match, so...

345
00:09:02,700 --> 00:09:03,890
What the hell!

346
00:09:03,890 --> 00:09:05,420
I took it slow

347
00:09:05,420 --> 00:09:07,640
Everyone got at least two pieces!

348
00:09:07,640 --> 00:09:10,840
The guy who did nothing was the winner after all

349
00:09:11,060 --> 00:09:18,610
Quickly line up the cups and let the bell ring!!

350
00:09:11,060 --> 00:09:18,610
Speed Cups - Germany

351
00:09:11,760 --> 00:09:13,800
The next game Tanaka chose

352
00:09:13,800 --> 00:09:16,730
Is "Speed Cups", from Germany

353
00:09:19,040 --> 00:09:21,740
Ok, this one's called "Speed Cups"

354
00:09:21,740 --> 00:09:24,250
This too is from Germany

355
00:09:24,610 --> 00:09:33,830
Germany  - Speed Cup

356
00:09:24,610 --> 00:09:33,830
Line up your cups in the color order the card is showing

357
00:09:24,610 --> 00:09:33,830
The fastest to do it and ring the bell, wins

358
00:09:25,180 --> 00:09:27,110
The rules are extremely simple

359
00:09:27,440 --> 00:09:30,580
Quickly line up your cups as displayed on the card

360
00:09:30,910 --> 00:09:33,320
The first one to do so and ring the bell, wins!

361
00:09:34,650 --> 00:09:38,130
I ha

362
00:09:34,650 --> 00:09:38,130
ga

363
00:09:34,650 --> 00:09:38,130
is

364
00:09:34,650 --> 00:09:38,130
me

365
00:09:34,650 --> 00:09:38,130
te th

366
00:09:38,860 --> 00:09:41,530
My lower back hurts too

367
00:09:40,520 --> 00:09:41,530
I can't

368
00:09:41,530 --> 00:09:42,930
Let's do it, let's do it

369
00:09:42,930 --> 00:09:44,260
He's surrounded

370
00:09:44,260 --> 00:09:44,760
Come on

371
00:09:44,760 --> 00:09:46,600
This is really something

372
00:09:46,600 --> 00:09:47,340
Seriously, look

373
00:09:47,340 --> 00:09:48,510
Even my finger is a bit cut and hurts

374
00:09:48,510 --> 00:09:50,280
Even my finger is a bit cut and hurts

375
00:09:49,070 --> 00:09:49,870
We're doing this

376
00:09:49,870 --> 00:09:50,870
You can't run

377
00:09:50,870 --> 00:09:53,400
I finally took that hangnail off

378
00:09:53,400 --> 00:09:55,170
These are third grader excuses

379
00:09:55,170 --> 00:09:57,370
Come on I just took it off

380
00:09:56,640 --> 00:09:57,670
Here we go

381
00:10:01,780 --> 00:10:02,580
Nope nope nope

382
00:10:03,410 --> 00:10:05,010
Alright alright alright

383
00:10:05,750 --> 00:10:06,920
Hamada-san did it

384
00:10:06,920 --> 00:10:08,120
Thanks

385
00:10:09,150 --> 00:10:10,120
Ok, they match!

386
00:10:10,120 --> 00:10:10,950
Good good

387
00:10:10,950 --> 00:10:12,150
He didn't stack em up

388
00:10:12,150 --> 00:10:13,230
Isn't this awful?

389
00:10:13,230 --> 00:10:14,160
Huh? Why?

390
00:10:14,600 --> 00:10:18,440
I can't see it (the card)

391
00:10:17,030 --> 00:10:18,530
If you couldn't see it

392
00:10:18,530 --> 00:10:20,510
You wouldn't line em up this way

393
00:10:20,510 --> 00:10:22,770
You got the right

394
00:10:21,570 --> 00:10:22,770
order 'cause you could see it

395
00:10:22,000 --> 00:10:22,770
He's right!

396
00:10:25,670 --> 00:10:26,070
Are you ready?

397
00:10:26,070 --> 00:10:26,770
Geez     - Ok

398
00:10:26,770 --> 00:10:27,200
Here goes

399
00:10:27,200 --> 00:10:28,150
How frustrating

400
00:10:29,140 --> 00:10:29,870
Here

401
00:10:34,880 --> 00:10:35,710
For real!

402
00:10:35,710 --> 00:10:36,420
Who was it?

403
00:10:36,710 --> 00:10:37,150
Hamada-san

404
00:10:37,150 --> 00:10:37,910
Hamada-san?

405
00:10:38,460 --> 00:10:40,090
Hamada-san is so fast!!

406
00:10:38,750 --> 00:10:40,090
What's going on?

407
00:10:40,090 --> 00:10:41,820
What's with this sudden ability?

408
00:10:41,820 --> 00:10:44,450
I have no idea what you're talking about

409
00:10:44,450 --> 00:10:46,490
This is hard, I don't think I can win

410
00:10:46,490 --> 00:10:46,950
We're going!

411
00:10:46,790 --> 00:10:47,900
Yeah me neither...

412
00:10:54,400 --> 00:10:55,200
Woah Hamada-san!

413
00:10:55,200 --> 00:10:57,060
He's friggin' fast, what is him?!

414
00:10:57,400 --> 00:10:59,360
Just what is him?!     - Hamada-san is amazing!

415
00:11:00,340 --> 00:11:03,550
So accurate too

416
00:11:01,730 --> 00:11:02,740
He is

417
00:11:02,740 --> 00:11:03,400
Yes...

418
00:11:04,210 --> 00:11:06,150
This ability?

419
00:11:04,210 --> 00:11:06,150
What is this now?

420
00:11:06,150 --> 00:11:07,980
Since when do you have it, Hamada-san?

421
00:11:07,980 --> 00:11:09,290
I think you

422
00:11:09,290 --> 00:11:13,260
Have you considered taking part in Inter-High?

423
00:11:09,290 --> 00:11:15,860
note: Inter-High School Championships is an annual sports competition for highschoolers

424
00:11:12,910 --> 00:11:14,960
Inter-High in Speed Cups...

425
00:11:13,860 --> 00:11:15,860
Which Inter-High?!

426
00:11:15,990 --> 00:11:19,430
Why don't you take part in a world tournament?

427
00:11:16,980 --> 00:11:18,150
Speed Cups?

428
00:11:18,690 --> 00:11:19,430
A Speed Cups game?

429
00:11:19,430 --> 00:11:21,430
Seriously, he's freaking fast

430
00:11:21,430 --> 00:11:23,160
He's so fast, I wonder how

431
00:11:23,160 --> 00:11:24,160
He's something

432
00:11:24,670 --> 00:11:28,000
His head is emptied of worldly thoughts

433
00:11:26,560 --> 00:11:27,730
What the hell!

434
00:11:28,630 --> 00:11:30,830
I wanna try to win at least one time

435
00:11:29,930 --> 00:11:30,830
Here we go

436
00:11:30,830 --> 00:11:32,270
Here    - Gotta try

437
00:11:33,070 --> 00:11:33,470
Oh, this is-

438
00:11:33,780 --> 00:11:34,800
I can do this

439
00:11:37,740 --> 00:11:38,510
Watch out!

440
00:11:38,510 --> 00:11:40,350
What happened?

441
00:11:40,350 --> 00:11:43,890
I was thrusted away !!

442
00:11:43,890 --> 00:11:47,560
I got thrusted away!

443
00:11:43,890 --> 00:11:47,560
Just when I thought I've pressed it

444
00:11:49,760 --> 00:11:51,030
That was scary    - Yeah

445
00:11:51,250 --> 00:11:53,000
He used his                  !!

446
00:11:51,250 --> 00:11:53,000
muscles

447
00:11:53,000 --> 00:11:54,930
You can't use your                   for that!!

448
00:11:53,000 --> 00:11:54,930
muscles

449
00:11:54,930 --> 00:11:56,990
Let's have it played in slow motion

450
00:12:04,040 --> 00:12:06,120
Hamada-san is on a rampage      - It was Hamada

451
00:12:06,120 --> 00:12:07,530
Yes, last one was Hamada-san's

452
00:12:07,530 --> 00:12:08,300
What!?

453
00:12:09,380 --> 00:12:11,780
This is our last one

454
00:12:10,200 --> 00:12:10,900
Alright

455
00:12:11,780 --> 00:12:12,400
Let's go

456
00:12:14,610 --> 00:12:15,610
The hell is this?

457
00:12:17,580 --> 00:12:18,190
So fast!

458
00:12:20,180 --> 00:12:21,310
He got it right

459
00:12:21,310 --> 00:12:21,910
So quick!

460
00:12:21,910 --> 00:12:24,380
Hamada-san got this one right too

461
00:12:23,590 --> 00:12:25,890
This is really ridiculous

462
00:12:24,380 --> 00:12:25,360
Amazing!

463
00:12:25,890 --> 00:12:26,880
5 points

464
00:12:26,880 --> 00:12:27,800
So fast...

465
00:12:27,920 --> 00:12:34,440
Hamada Wins

466
00:12:30,000 --> 00:12:31,290
What was that?

467
00:12:31,290 --> 00:12:32,420
His abilty...

468
00:12:32,420 --> 00:12:34,100
He destroyed us

469
00:12:34,100 --> 00:12:35,200
Must be some power

470
00:12:35,200 --> 00:12:36,300
Between the 5 of us he's the idiot number one for sure

471
00:12:36,300 --> 00:12:39,640
Between the 5 of us he's the idiot number one for sure

472
00:12:40,600 --> 00:12:41,040
His score

473
00:12:41,040 --> 00:12:43,380
Was so pure!!

474
00:12:43,380 --> 00:12:45,040
He was so dedicate to it

475
00:12:45,900 --> 00:12:46,700
Coming up

476
00:12:46,200 --> 00:12:52,820
Hamada's serious struggle with a rhythm game!?

477
00:12:46,700 --> 00:12:49,440
We'll see Hamada's struggle with a rhythm game!

478
00:12:53,410 --> 00:13:00,760
Strike a pose while following the rhythm!!

479
00:12:53,410 --> 00:13:00,760
We Will Rock You - France

480
00:12:54,380 --> 00:12:57,280
The next table game Tanaka chose

481
00:12:57,280 --> 00:13:00,020
Is "We Will Rock You" from France!

482
00:13:01,130 --> 00:13:06,670
First of all I'll give a random card for each one of you

483
00:13:06,670 --> 00:13:07,770
So, this is mine

484
00:13:08,430 --> 00:13:09,670
This is Endo's

485
00:13:09,960 --> 00:13:10,860
Hamada-san

486
00:13:11,090 --> 00:13:11,790
Matsumoto-san

487
00:13:12,470 --> 00:13:15,170
The pose drawn in the card will

488
00:13:15,170 --> 00:13:17,580
Become your own personal pose!!

489
00:13:17,030 --> 00:13:17,580
I see

490
00:13:17,580 --> 00:13:19,070
So Endo-san will go like this

491
00:13:19,070 --> 00:13:21,270
Hamada-san this-- So, these have become

492
00:13:21,270 --> 00:13:22,720
Your poses    - Ok

493
00:13:22,720 --> 00:13:23,570
With them...

494
00:13:23,570 --> 00:13:26,210
Giving that the game is called "We Will Rock You"

495
00:13:26,680 --> 00:13:27,380
You know

496
00:13:27,590 --> 00:13:28,990
Using the rhythm from Queen's "We Will Rock You"

497
00:13:28,990 --> 00:13:30,820
Using the rhythm from Queen's "We Will Rock You"

498
00:13:31,710 --> 00:13:32,410
Exactly

499
00:13:35,850 --> 00:13:37,450
Like this, let's start from me

500
00:13:37,450 --> 00:13:39,530
On your turn you go like that

501
00:13:39,530 --> 00:13:43,470
Then you strike your pose and choose one of another player

502
00:13:43,470 --> 00:13:46,870
Then you strike your pose and choose one of another player

503
00:13:47,270 --> 00:13:50,040
For example, if I happen to choose Housei's pose

504
00:13:50,040 --> 00:13:50,830
First of all

505
00:13:50,830 --> 00:13:52,400
I strike my pose

506
00:13:52,400 --> 00:13:53,910
And then his

507
00:13:53,910 --> 00:13:57,370
So, because I chose Housei-san's pose as my second one

508
00:13:57,370 --> 00:13:59,810
Now it's Housei-san's turn to strike two poses

509
00:13:59,810 --> 00:14:01,120
Then, first of all

510
00:14:01,120 --> 00:14:04,320
He must do his own pose first

511
00:14:04,320 --> 00:14:06,820
And again, he randomly selects his second pose

512
00:14:06,820 --> 00:14:10,800
And again, he randomly selects his second pose

513
00:14:08,380 --> 00:14:08,980
Oh, got it

514
00:14:08,980 --> 00:14:10,800
I see, I see, I see

515
00:14:10,800 --> 00:14:11,750
So...     - Let's try

516
00:14:11,750 --> 00:14:12,990
Are we trying this?

517
00:14:12,990 --> 00:14:13,990
We'll start from me

518
00:14:13,990 --> 00:14:15,020
Alright

519
00:14:19,330 --> 00:14:20,190
Here I go      - Go

520
00:14:29,190 --> 00:14:30,040
What the hell

521
00:14:30,040 --> 00:14:30,580
Endo-san

522
00:14:30,580 --> 00:14:32,750
Goin' for eternity!!

523
00:14:31,440 --> 00:14:32,750
Come on dude

524
00:14:33,140 --> 00:14:34,750
This is har--- huh?     - Endo-san

525
00:14:34,750 --> 00:14:36,050
Was I pointed at?    - No no no

526
00:14:36,050 --> 00:14:37,740
Your pose...      - He did this

527
00:14:37,020 --> 00:14:40,310
The fact I did your pose meant you've been chosen

528
00:14:37,740 --> 00:14:39,510
He chose your pose

529
00:14:40,310 --> 00:14:42,990
So it's your turn to strike it

530
00:14:42,050 --> 00:14:42,990
Oh, is that how it is?

531
00:14:43,690 --> 00:14:46,130
So he should have done his own first?     - Yes

532
00:14:46,130 --> 00:14:48,020
You have to do your own first     - My own, ok

533
00:14:48,020 --> 00:14:49,560
The second one is up to you

534
00:14:48,970 --> 00:14:51,770
Before choosing the other, right?

535
00:14:48,970 --> 00:14:51,770
So you always have to strike your own pose

536
00:14:50,490 --> 00:14:51,370
Right     - Yes

537
00:14:51,770 --> 00:14:52,830
Ok, I'm going      - Ok

538
00:14:52,830 --> 00:14:53,560
Get ready

539
00:14:53,560 --> 00:14:54,460
One, two...

540
00:15:04,380 --> 00:15:06,750
Hamada-san !!

541
00:15:05,000 --> 00:15:05,770
Hamada-san?

542
00:15:06,750 --> 00:15:07,420
Was it me?

543
00:15:07,420 --> 00:15:09,590
He can't keep up with this at all !!

544
00:15:08,370 --> 00:15:09,590
I'm not following

545
00:15:09,590 --> 00:15:13,220
You weren't looking at me, Hamada-san?

546
00:15:11,840 --> 00:15:12,880
He wasn't looking

547
00:15:13,220 --> 00:15:14,870
After I did this

548
00:15:14,870 --> 00:15:15,510
I did yours

549
00:15:15,180 --> 00:15:18,060
There's a chance your own pose is coming as the 2nd one

550
00:15:18,060 --> 00:15:20,730
Hamada hasn't looked at me at all, that's why

551
00:15:20,730 --> 00:15:21,790
He looked away

552
00:15:21,790 --> 00:15:24,920
I was focusing on the others     - Oh I see

553
00:15:24,920 --> 00:15:25,770
This is hard

554
00:15:25,770 --> 00:15:27,840
We have to stay focused     - Yes

555
00:15:27,840 --> 00:15:28,100
Also

556
00:15:28,100 --> 00:15:31,610
He went full cat pose while looking towards my direction

557
00:15:30,600 --> 00:15:31,610
While smiling

558
00:15:31,610 --> 00:15:33,210
(The rhythm was) maybe too fast

559
00:15:33,210 --> 00:15:37,550
(staff)

560
00:15:33,210 --> 00:15:37,550
Let's try to do it considerably slower than this

561
00:15:34,230 --> 00:15:35,330
Let's take it slowly

562
00:15:35,330 --> 00:15:37,200
Yes please      - It was too fast

563
00:15:37,200 --> 00:15:38,670
Let's take it easy

564
00:15:37,550 --> 00:15:40,920
I mean what do you think is the average age in here?

565
00:15:40,920 --> 00:15:43,920
Housei-san

566
00:15:42,030 --> 00:15:42,940
Come on, Yama-chan     - Can I?

567
00:15:42,940 --> 00:15:43,410
Ok

568
00:15:56,920 --> 00:15:59,900
That thing you're doing is bothering me

569
00:15:59,900 --> 00:16:02,560
Seriously I can't withstand it

570
00:16:02,560 --> 00:16:06,900
He keeps on bouncing it to me! This shouldn't be allowed!

571
00:16:06,900 --> 00:16:07,570
Right but

572
00:16:07,570 --> 00:16:11,810
Unrelated to that, you kept on raising your hands so annoyingly

573
00:16:09,000 --> 00:16:09,730
He's right

574
00:16:10,870 --> 00:16:12,250
That's not it

575
00:16:12,250 --> 00:16:15,850
I think this guy is totally throwing down the gauntlet at me

576
00:16:15,850 --> 00:16:19,550
In a one-to-one

577
00:16:16,840 --> 00:16:17,710
Yes, it's a duel

578
00:16:19,940 --> 00:16:26,030
They will change all their current cards and face a new challenge!

579
00:16:19,940 --> 00:16:26,030
note: voice = same as text

580
00:16:24,080 --> 00:16:26,030
I see     - What's this?      - This one's hard!

581
00:16:26,030 --> 00:16:27,520
Ok, Endo      - I'm going

582
00:16:53,110 --> 00:16:53,820
No no no

583
00:16:53,820 --> 00:16:56,490
You're one beat off!!

584
00:16:55,710 --> 00:16:57,310
He's completely off!

585
00:16:56,490 --> 00:16:58,260
You're tempo is really slow!!

586
00:16:57,310 --> 00:16:59,310
Yeah, the way he gets into it

587
00:16:59,310 --> 00:17:00,990
He reflects before posing

588
00:17:00,990 --> 00:17:02,590
I have no idea what to do next

589
00:17:03,500 --> 00:17:06,330
I don't know where should I pass my baton!!

590
00:17:06,470 --> 00:17:08,090
Man this is freaky

591
00:17:08,090 --> 00:17:10,040
It's making my heart race

592
00:17:10,040 --> 00:17:12,300
It's a really fun game

593
00:17:12,300 --> 00:17:15,240
Don't say I'm slow!

594
00:17:15,240 --> 00:17:21,740
note: voice = same as text

595
00:17:16,030 --> 00:17:21,740
Coming up: Matsumoto's unexpected talent!?

596
00:17:22,280 --> 00:17:29,050
Dancing Egg - Germany

597
00:17:22,280 --> 00:17:29,050
Let's grip the eggs with every part of the body!!

598
00:17:23,070 --> 00:17:24,950
The next table game

599
00:17:24,950 --> 00:17:27,710
Is "Dancing Egg", from Germany!

600
00:17:29,410 --> 00:17:31,910
This is a game called "Dancing Egg"     - Ok

601
00:17:33,080 --> 00:17:34,020
Here

602
00:17:34,020 --> 00:17:36,160
There are lots of eggs as you can see

603
00:17:36,160 --> 00:17:39,130
There are lots of eggs as you can see

604
00:17:39,130 --> 00:17:41,000
You roll the dice and do what the face you got indicates you to

605
00:17:41,000 --> 00:17:42,730
You roll the dice and do what the face you got indicates you to

606
00:17:43,300 --> 00:17:46,030
Then you have to hold the eggs with the displayed body part

607
00:17:46,030 --> 00:17:50,170
Then you have to hold the eggs with the displayed body part

608
00:17:50,170 --> 00:17:53,280
There are these two types of dice, a red one and a white one

609
00:17:53,280 --> 00:17:55,280
You throw the red one first

610
00:17:55,280 --> 00:17:57,510
You can see there are various images on it

611
00:17:57,510 --> 00:17:59,650
Those are various directions

612
00:17:59,650 --> 00:18:02,650
The person who takes the egg, must throw the white dice

613
00:18:03,080 --> 00:18:05,020
For example, in this case

614
00:18:05,750 --> 00:18:09,490
You use your thighs

615
00:18:06,180 --> 00:18:09,490
You follow the directions which tells you to hold it in various ways

616
00:18:09,490 --> 00:18:12,160
The eggs you're holding gradually becomes more and more

617
00:18:12,660 --> 00:18:15,400
Doesn't it become difficult for the one who takes them?

618
00:18:15,400 --> 00:18:16,670
It does

619
00:18:16,770 --> 00:18:19,300
But getting the eggs is the point of this game

620
00:18:19,300 --> 00:18:21,400
So by doing so you're stacking up points

621
00:18:21,400 --> 00:18:22,870
It surely becomes difficult

622
00:18:22,870 --> 00:18:26,740
But in the end the one who stacks up

623
00:18:22,870 --> 00:18:26,740
More eggs without making them fall, wins

624
00:18:26,740 --> 00:18:39,860
"Cock-a-doodle-doo"

625
00:18:26,740 --> 00:18:39,860
Any noise

626
00:18:26,740 --> 00:18:39,860
As fast as possible

627
00:18:26,740 --> 00:18:39,860
As fast as possible

628
00:18:26,740 --> 00:18:39,860
As fast as possible

629
00:18:26,740 --> 00:18:39,860
Catch it as it falls

630
00:18:26,740 --> 00:18:39,860
Drop the egg and

631
00:18:26,740 --> 00:18:39,860
Grab the dice

632
00:18:26,740 --> 00:18:39,860
No one must make

633
00:18:26,740 --> 00:18:39,860
Run around the table

634
00:18:26,740 --> 00:18:39,860
The dice gets the egg

635
00:18:26,740 --> 00:18:39,860
The one who threw

636
00:18:27,130 --> 00:18:29,470
On the red dice, the one you throw first

637
00:18:29,470 --> 00:18:33,310
There are lots of directions, such as running around the table

638
00:18:33,310 --> 00:18:35,210
Or shouting "cock-a-doodle-doo"

639
00:18:35,210 --> 00:18:36,800
The one who clears it first

640
00:18:36,800 --> 00:18:39,310
Gets the right to acquire one egg!

641
00:18:40,450 --> 00:18:41,410
Question, sorry      - Yes?

642
00:18:41,350 --> 00:18:52,870
Drop the egg and catch it

643
00:18:41,410 --> 00:18:42,980
What's that "drop the egg" about?

644
00:18:42,980 --> 00:18:44,080
The one who gets it

645
00:18:44,080 --> 00:18:45,450
Takes the egg and

646
00:18:45,450 --> 00:18:47,350
Lets it fall down like this

647
00:18:47,350 --> 00:18:52,320
We encircle it and the first one to get it as it bounces, wins it

648
00:18:53,200 --> 00:18:56,300
So we're acting as if we want to insert them on us

649
00:18:55,190 --> 00:18:56,300
Right, right, right

650
00:18:56,300 --> 00:18:58,160
"Insert them on us"?

651
00:18:58,160 --> 00:19:00,170
So we're holding them between our body parts?

652
00:19:00,830 --> 00:19:02,240
Yeah you hold them

653
00:19:02,240 --> 00:19:05,610
And the point is how long you can keep them

654
00:19:05,840 --> 00:19:06,840
Alright

655
00:19:06,840 --> 00:19:08,040
If you're ready, let's start

656
00:19:11,240 --> 00:19:12,890
We have to drop one egg

657
00:19:13,010 --> 00:19:20,230
Drop the egg and catch it

658
00:19:13,150 --> 00:19:15,050
Ok let's do it, I'll drop it here

659
00:19:15,050 --> 00:19:16,450
You have to catch it, here goes

660
00:19:19,350 --> 00:19:20,620
Ok, I took it

661
00:19:21,120 --> 00:19:21,950
What the hell

662
00:19:21,950 --> 00:19:23,100
You're playing alone

663
00:19:23,100 --> 00:19:26,100
You're doing everything by yourself

664
00:19:24,690 --> 00:19:25,490
What is this?

665
00:19:26,100 --> 00:19:28,230
So now you roll the white one?

666
00:19:28,230 --> 00:19:29,090
Yeah this

667
00:19:29,090 --> 00:19:30,690
To know where to place it, right?

668
00:19:30,690 --> 00:19:31,960
It's an armpit

669
00:19:31,960 --> 00:19:34,700
This can get in your next movements' way

670
00:19:33,610 --> 00:19:36,280
Armpit

671
00:19:33,900 --> 00:19:35,070
Ok, I got this

672
00:19:35,710 --> 00:19:36,970
Endo's turn     - Alright

673
00:19:38,380 --> 00:19:50,220
Run around the table

674
00:19:38,800 --> 00:19:39,340
Around!

675
00:19:43,720 --> 00:19:46,250
Of course he took it!!

676
00:19:46,250 --> 00:19:48,080
It's not like we can run any faster

677
00:19:50,280 --> 00:19:51,400
It's right this way

678
00:19:51,400 --> 00:19:53,220
Yama-chan could have take it easily

679
00:19:53,220 --> 00:19:54,280
Alright alright alright

680
00:19:55,080 --> 00:19:56,930
Do I have to roll it?      - Yes please

681
00:19:57,420 --> 00:19:58,930
I got uhh...

682
00:19:58,250 --> 00:20:03,070
Chin

683
00:19:58,930 --> 00:19:59,420
Woah!

684
00:19:59,420 --> 00:20:01,420
This suddenly became bothersome

685
00:20:01,420 --> 00:20:03,070
This is tough     - It is

686
00:20:05,060 --> 00:20:09,780
Make a chicken noise

687
00:20:05,560 --> 00:20:07,430
COCK-A-DOODLE-DOO!

688
00:20:07,430 --> 00:20:09,600
I think Matsumoto-san was the fastest

689
00:20:09,600 --> 00:20:10,110
Good

690
00:20:10,110 --> 00:20:10,770
Take that

691
00:20:11,700 --> 00:20:17,780
Anywhere = OK

692
00:20:12,100 --> 00:20:13,900
Oh, you can place it anywhere you want

693
00:20:18,500 --> 00:20:19,080
What?

694
00:20:19,080 --> 00:20:21,020
You're plotting against yourself

695
00:20:20,600 --> 00:20:21,450
I think that

696
00:20:21,450 --> 00:20:25,860
I can keep a better balance this way

697
00:20:22,440 --> 00:20:24,010
Oh, I see it makes sense this way

698
00:20:24,380 --> 00:20:25,550
Still looks cornered to me

699
00:20:29,780 --> 00:20:34,000
Make a chicken noise

700
00:20:30,290 --> 00:20:32,590
COCK-A-DOODLE-DOO!

701
00:20:31,700 --> 00:20:32,590
Ok, Matsumoto-san

702
00:20:32,590 --> 00:20:34,420
This is so strange

703
00:20:34,860 --> 00:20:39,070
Arm

704
00:20:36,620 --> 00:20:37,230
Arm?

705
00:20:37,230 --> 00:20:38,690
Like this?      - Yes

706
00:20:38,690 --> 00:20:39,070
Ok

707
00:20:39,070 --> 00:20:40,350
Yama-chan      - Ok

708
00:20:41,800 --> 00:20:49,410
Drop the egg and catch it

709
00:20:42,530 --> 00:20:43,870
Oh, this one again

710
00:20:48,300 --> 00:20:49,710
That was so good

711
00:20:49,710 --> 00:20:51,680
He's really good at this game

712
00:20:50,540 --> 00:20:51,280
He is

713
00:20:51,910 --> 00:20:52,500
Again?

714
00:20:52,500 --> 00:20:53,300
It's the chin

715
00:20:53,020 --> 00:21:00,690
Chin

716
00:20:53,300 --> 00:20:54,240
The chin again?

717
00:20:54,240 --> 00:20:56,780
He's so good at this, his chin again

718
00:20:56,780 --> 00:20:58,010
He's doing great

719
00:20:58,560 --> 00:20:59,210
Impressive

720
00:20:59,210 --> 00:21:01,210
He's holding so many eggs!

721
00:21:00,150 --> 00:21:02,020
He already got four of them!

722
00:21:02,060 --> 00:21:08,830
Drop the egg and catch it

723
00:21:02,580 --> 00:21:04,000
Yama-chan     - This one again

724
00:21:06,200 --> 00:21:07,790
So good!

725
00:21:07,790 --> 00:21:08,830
That's impressive

726
00:21:08,830 --> 00:21:10,090
He's killing it!    - Amazing!

727
00:21:11,190 --> 00:21:12,690
You gotta see where to place it

728
00:21:13,000 --> 00:21:16,670
Arm

729
00:21:14,260 --> 00:21:15,260
The other one

730
00:21:16,430 --> 00:21:18,570
He's holding so many eggs!

731
00:21:20,570 --> 00:21:28,950
Run around the table

732
00:21:21,230 --> 00:21:22,770
We gotta run!

733
00:21:29,180 --> 00:21:30,450
Here Matsumoto-san

734
00:21:30,450 --> 00:21:32,450
Matsumoto-san is so good

735
00:21:32,450 --> 00:21:33,280
Incredible

736
00:21:33,050 --> 00:21:39,630
Anywhere = OK

737
00:21:33,280 --> 00:21:35,150
Anywhere's fine     - Anywhere again!

738
00:21:38,250 --> 00:21:38,920
The armpit!

739
00:21:38,920 --> 00:21:39,700
Only one left

740
00:21:39,700 --> 00:21:41,020
I'm throwing it

741
00:21:42,030 --> 00:21:48,570
Run around the table

742
00:21:42,570 --> 00:21:43,470
We gotta run!

743
00:21:43,470 --> 00:21:44,160
Let's run!

744
00:21:46,530 --> 00:21:47,390
Hurry up

745
00:21:47,390 --> 00:21:48,210
Let's take it

746
00:21:48,210 --> 00:21:48,800
Come on

747
00:21:48,800 --> 00:21:49,800
Ok he took it

748
00:21:49,800 --> 00:21:50,600
Now throw this

749
00:21:50,700 --> 00:21:57,510
Armpit

750
00:21:51,570 --> 00:21:52,390
Where is this?

751
00:21:52,390 --> 00:21:53,470
Armpit

752
00:21:58,770 --> 00:22:00,710
He's so strong

753
00:21:58,970 --> 00:22:00,710
Who won?      - The winner is...

754
00:22:00,710 --> 00:22:02,480
Who is it?      - It's Matsumoto-san

755
00:22:02,480 --> 00:22:07,590
Matsumoto Wins

756
00:22:04,540 --> 00:22:06,780
His victory was overwhelming

757
00:22:07,590 --> 00:22:11,490
I haven't had fun at all !!

758
00:22:11,490 --> 00:22:16,400
I'm never playing this again !!

759
00:22:15,090 --> 00:22:16,150
He tossed it away

760
00:22:17,190 --> 00:22:22,640
A shocking electric game full of tension!!

761
00:22:17,360 --> 00:22:18,120
Coming up

762
00:22:18,120 --> 00:22:21,000
Is a shocking game full of suspense!

763
00:22:23,320 --> 00:22:23,930
Alright

764
00:22:24,560 --> 00:22:25,840
I've mentioned this before

765
00:22:26,050 --> 00:22:32,350
If your reaction is slow, you'll get an electric shock!!

766
00:22:26,050 --> 00:22:32,350
Lightning Reaction Reloaded - U.S.A.

767
00:22:26,660 --> 00:22:28,100
Do we really have to do this?

768
00:22:28,100 --> 00:22:30,630
I don't want to      - Me neither, I don't want this

769
00:22:30,630 --> 00:22:32,350
This was the electric thingy, right?

770
00:22:32,350 --> 00:22:33,550
This too is from U.S.A.

771
00:22:33,550 --> 00:22:36,180
Reflexes, right?

772
00:22:34,740 --> 00:22:36,180
Yeah, it's about reflexes

773
00:22:36,180 --> 00:22:38,290
Music will start playing

774
00:22:38,290 --> 00:22:40,650
Each one of you has to hold a handle

775
00:22:40,650 --> 00:22:43,620
And as soon as the music stops

776
00:22:43,620 --> 00:22:45,430
On your own handle

777
00:22:43,620 --> 00:22:45,430
You have to press the button

778
00:22:45,430 --> 00:22:47,460
The slowest one to press it will be electrocuted

779
00:22:47,460 --> 00:22:49,360
The slowest one to press it will be electrocuted

780
00:22:48,250 --> 00:22:49,360
Ok, I got it

781
00:22:49,590 --> 00:22:51,150
Each of you grab one

782
00:22:51,150 --> 00:22:51,970
This...

783
00:22:51,970 --> 00:22:54,070
Is only for 4 people, right?

784
00:22:52,990 --> 00:22:53,720
Four people, yes

785
00:22:54,070 --> 00:22:56,970
You're not doing this, Tanaka?

786
00:22:55,800 --> 00:22:56,970
I'm not doing this

787
00:22:58,910 --> 00:22:59,710
If I press it before?

788
00:22:59,710 --> 00:23:03,210
You get electrocuted even if you press it before the music stops

789
00:23:02,610 --> 00:23:03,210
Got it

790
00:23:03,830 --> 00:23:04,510
Ok so

791
00:23:04,510 --> 00:23:06,410
I'm going to press the button and let the music start

792
00:23:06,410 --> 00:23:07,910
So as soon as it stops

793
00:23:06,900 --> 00:23:08,500
This is like a Batsu Game

794
00:23:07,910 --> 00:23:09,880
Be ready to press the button as fast as you can!

795
00:23:08,910 --> 00:23:09,540
Alright

796
00:23:10,580 --> 00:23:11,500
Here goes

797
00:23:21,400 --> 00:23:22,820
THAT HURT!!

798
00:23:25,000 --> 00:23:30,000
Translation & Subtitles by Shion

799
00:23:25,500 --> 00:23:26,560
You just...

800
00:23:26,560 --> 00:23:28,190
It hurts, it hurts, it hurts!

801
00:23:28,190 --> 00:23:29,970
You just scared the shit out of me!

www.shionnotsukai.wordpress.com

803
00:23:30,260 --> 00:23:31,370
This hurts so bad!

804
00:23:31,370 --> 00:23:32,870
This is incredibly terrifying

805
00:23:32,870 --> 00:23:35,230
It hurts a lot!

806
00:23:33,500 --> 00:23:35,230
What the hell!

808
00:23:35,530 --> 00:23:36,040
Sorry but

809
00:23:36,040 --> 00:23:37,110
One more time please

810
00:23:37,110 --> 00:23:38,130
Wha-?       - Come on...

811
00:23:38,630 --> 00:23:40,350
Come on, we're done Endo

Want to support my translations? Consider donating @ ko-fi.com/shionnotsukai

813
00:23:40,350 --> 00:23:43,900
Then let's have a deciding round with Endo and Hamada alone

814
00:23:43,900 --> 00:23:44,910
Why should we!?

815
00:23:45,670 --> 00:23:47,250
What do we "decide" with it?!

816
00:23:47,250 --> 00:23:49,250
'Cause he just shouted when Endo got hit

817
00:23:48,600 --> 00:23:49,710
I didn't shout!

818
00:23:49,250 --> 00:23:50,450
What are we deciding?

819
00:23:50,450 --> 00:23:51,920
He did      - It's pointless

820
00:23:51,920 --> 00:23:54,050
We already got our scores

821
00:23:52,180 --> 00:23:54,520
Let's have you dual-wield them, lik- AAAAH!

822
00:23:55,520 --> 00:23:57,290
There was still something left on that!

823
00:24:00,120 --> 00:24:01,460
Two....      - They were still charged

824
00:24:01,460 --> 00:24:03,360
He took two of them and shouted like crazy!

825
00:24:03,990 --> 00:24:09,560
Matsumoto's rage on Housei's scheme!?

826
00:24:03,990 --> 00:24:09,560
