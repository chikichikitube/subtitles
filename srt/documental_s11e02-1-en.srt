[Subbed by Thanos-no-Tsukai
Thanks For Watching!]

2
00:00:22,900 --> 00:00:33,310
I guess the show that is Documental has started to distance itself from the world of pure comedy and started to delve into the more mainstream world of entertainment.

3
00:00:33,440 --> 00:00:35,320
-It's been a while!
-Shingo!

4
00:00:36,730 --> 00:00:43,360
I think it's great to have comedians and actors mingling together.

5
00:00:43,510 --> 00:00:46,590
We didn't want to limit ourselves so we just went all out.

6
00:00:46,880 --> 00:00:49,580
Anyone can participate.

7
00:00:49,780 --> 00:00:55,370
It doesn't matter what gender they are.

8
00:00:55,510 --> 00:00:57,150
Even kids can participate.

9
00:00:57,690 --> 00:01:01,780
And at the very end I would love to see a chimpanzee in there as well.

10
00:01:03,780 --> 00:01:05,010
About last season...

11
00:01:05,010 --> 00:01:07,010
You guys have to laugh hard when I say that.

12
00:01:07,010 --> 00:01:09,610
I mean, you have to tell me that's too much!

13
00:01:09,610 --> 00:01:11,680
A chimpanzee is too much.

14
00:01:12,190 --> 00:01:13,880
There's no way we'd get that.

15
00:02:21,930 --> 00:02:24,630
Actually I was the first to come in.

16
00:02:25,320 --> 00:02:26,320
Did you guys hear any voices before coming in?

17
00:02:27,680 --> 00:02:29,530
Everyone was laughing when I came in.

18
00:02:30,740 --> 00:02:31,350
You three were laughing.

19
00:02:31,350 --> 00:02:32,060
Kazunori is trying to do something.
You three were laughing.

20
00:02:32,060 --> 00:02:33,680
Kazunori is trying to do something.

21
00:02:33,680 --> 00:02:34,180
He's fishing for: "Is he sleeping?".
Kazunori is trying to do something.

22
00:02:34,180 --> 00:02:35,720
He's fishing for: "Is he sleeping?".

23
00:02:37,530 --> 00:02:38,610
It's Kazunori's first time.

24
00:02:39,050 --> 00:02:42,150
-That part looks a bit like my home.
-Oh, really?

25
00:02:42,190 --> 00:02:43,120
I was desperate.

26
00:02:48,150 --> 00:02:49,660
You can't be doing that!

27
00:02:50,130 --> 00:02:51,470
I mean, this is just a yellow card.

28
00:02:51,520 --> 00:02:52,770
You chuckled!

29
00:02:52,920 --> 00:02:54,380
You went like this!

30
00:03:00,950 --> 00:03:01,850
Our first 1-minute laugh!

31
00:03:02,390 --> 00:03:04,340
He might be the fastest dropout.

32
00:03:04,790 --> 00:03:06,000
Only one minute passed!

33
00:03:06,060 --> 00:03:09,690
But I think that was just an unavoidable reflex.

34
00:03:09,920 --> 00:03:11,080
-Right.
-It's really dangerous.

35
00:03:11,220 --> 00:03:13,030
I couldn't stop it.

36
00:03:13,750 --> 00:03:15,330
We're all here together...

37
00:03:15,380 --> 00:03:16,450
Alright, here we go.

38
00:03:16,990 --> 00:03:17,720
Start!

39
00:03:21,030 --> 00:03:22,150
Is the Oyakata gonna be alright?

40
00:03:22,150 --> 00:03:22,410
He's in trouble for sure.
Is the Oyakata gonna be alright?

41
00:03:22,410 --> 00:03:23,650
He's in trouble for sure.

42
00:03:24,680 --> 00:03:26,350
Look, he's already grinning.

43
00:03:26,650 --> 00:03:29,280
He might also remember what he laughed about and do it again.

44
00:03:31,550 --> 00:03:32,920
No one's talking.

45
00:03:35,350 --> 00:03:36,050
Kazunori is sleepy.

46
00:03:36,050 --> 00:03:36,510
-He's setting something up.
-He is.
Kazunori is sleepy.

47
00:03:36,510 --> 00:03:37,580
-He's setting something up.
-He is.

48
00:03:37,970 --> 00:03:41,400
He's been doing that this whole time but Musaka always gets in his way.

49
00:03:42,010 --> 00:03:42,590
Well, sure.

50
00:03:42,590 --> 00:03:43,020
Don't say that.
Well, sure.

51
00:03:43,020 --> 00:03:43,590
Don't say that.

52
00:03:44,050 --> 00:03:45,440
Should we put these in the locker room?

53
00:03:45,620 --> 00:03:46,620
Right.

54
00:03:47,520 --> 00:03:49,060
Everyone, you have to look at Katsunori!

55
00:03:49,790 --> 00:03:51,010
No one's looking at him.

56
00:03:51,030 --> 00:03:51,820
Yeah.

57
00:03:52,470 --> 00:03:53,520
He looks so sad.

58
00:03:54,480 --> 00:03:55,880
He's trying to do it again!

59
00:03:55,880 --> 00:03:57,260
And everyone's gone!

60
00:03:58,000 --> 00:03:58,790
Well...

61
00:03:58,840 --> 00:04:00,390
They all went, huh?

62
00:04:00,390 --> 00:04:01,350
We have to be careful.

63
00:04:01,780 --> 00:04:05,480
If they were all comedians they'd stick around and see what happens.

64
00:04:05,590 --> 00:04:07,210
That's the scary part about this iteration of the show.

65
00:04:07,210 --> 00:04:09,980
That's right.
This kind of odd situation will keep happening.

66
00:04:10,090 --> 00:04:11,540
Us comedians would realize what he's doing.

67
00:04:11,540 --> 00:04:11,810
-Right, we'd know he's trying to do something.
-Yeah.
Us comedians would realize what he's doing.

68
00:04:11,810 --> 00:04:14,420
-Right, we'd know he's trying to do something.
-Yeah.

69
00:04:14,640 --> 00:04:15,330
So...

70
00:04:16,590 --> 00:04:17,050
Huh?

71
00:04:17,240 --> 00:04:17,620
Huh?

72
00:04:18,230 --> 00:04:19,320
Here he comes.

73
00:04:20,250 --> 00:04:21,150
I took off my hat.

74
00:04:22,220 --> 00:04:22,720
How's that?

75
00:04:23,620 --> 00:04:24,180
How is it?

76
00:04:24,600 --> 00:04:25,580
What do you think of that?

77
00:04:26,850 --> 00:04:28,720
No way...

78
00:04:28,720 --> 00:04:29,450
It's pretty funny.
No way...

79
00:04:29,450 --> 00:04:30,010
It's pretty funny.

80
00:04:30,100 --> 00:04:31,050
It's funny.

81
00:04:33,290 --> 00:04:35,280
If I was in there I would hate this.

82
00:04:35,550 --> 00:04:36,450
I usually wear this.

83
00:04:36,570 --> 00:04:37,850
The bags under his eyes are way too big!

84
00:04:39,090 --> 00:04:39,880
They are crazy!

85
00:04:40,330 --> 00:04:43,000
I mean, the wig does accentuate the bags under his eyes.

86
00:04:43,140 --> 00:04:43,720
Right.

87
00:04:44,580 --> 00:04:46,260
-He's trying so hard.
-Those bags under his eyes...

88
00:04:47,380 --> 00:04:49,230
Oyakata is trying really hard.

89
00:04:51,480 --> 00:04:52,850
But it might be a bit big for me.

90
00:04:54,320 --> 00:04:54,880
Don't you think?

91
00:04:54,880 --> 00:04:55,390
It's perfect.

92
00:04:55,470 --> 00:04:55,950
Really?

93
00:04:56,000 --> 00:04:56,250
Yes.

94
00:04:56,320 --> 00:04:57,250
Oyakata is in trouble.

95
00:04:57,250 --> 00:04:58,070
Yeah, he is.

96
00:04:58,320 --> 00:04:59,490
Oyakata is always in trouble.

97
00:04:59,560 --> 00:05:02,880
-His face is swinging up and down.
-Back and forth.

98
00:05:03,030 --> 00:05:03,780
He really is.

99
00:05:05,450 --> 00:05:06,520
He's putting on more stuff?

100
00:05:06,620 --> 00:05:07,520
More stuff?

101
00:05:11,120 --> 00:05:12,180
He's pointing! (EN: 1)

102
00:05:12,250 --> 00:05:13,390
He's pointing!

103
00:05:14,530 --> 00:05:14,950
Ouch!

104
00:05:15,270 --> 00:05:16,620
Whoa, that startled me!

105
00:05:16,820 --> 00:05:17,250
Sorry.

106
00:05:21,500 --> 00:05:22,650
I'm glad I was wearing the helmet.

107
00:05:22,920 --> 00:05:23,320
Yes.

108
00:05:23,560 --> 00:05:25,320
-He went all out!

109
00:05:25,320 --> 00:05:25,480
He hit him full force.
-He went all out!

110
00:05:25,480 --> 00:05:26,580
He hit him full force.

111
00:05:27,030 --> 00:05:28,240
I can't believe he hit Musaka.

112
00:05:28,240 --> 00:05:28,800
That was a good one.

113
00:05:28,800 --> 00:05:29,240
Did they say we could drink anything?
That was a good one.

114
00:05:29,240 --> 00:05:30,240
Did they say we could drink anything?

115
00:05:30,460 --> 00:05:30,720
Yes.

116
00:05:31,980 --> 00:05:34,020
Right, they also said we could cook.

117
00:05:34,400 --> 00:05:35,080
Should I cook?

118
00:05:35,300 --> 00:05:36,770
Yeah, you look like you can cook.

119
00:05:37,100 --> 00:05:39,120
Yeah, he can definitely cook.

120
00:05:39,340 --> 00:05:40,450
I also want to see him cook.

121
00:05:42,680 --> 00:05:43,180
Look at Oyakata.

122
00:05:43,180 --> 00:05:43,420
He's already a goner.
Look at Oyakata.

123
00:05:43,420 --> 00:05:44,380
He's already a goner.

124
00:05:45,570 --> 00:05:47,320
Oyakata is having a lot of trouble.

125
00:05:47,720 --> 00:05:49,350
He's in a daze.

126
00:05:50,230 --> 00:05:51,230
Sorry about that.

127
00:05:51,740 --> 00:05:53,210
-I want to get acquainted with this place already.
-Me too!

128
00:05:53,670 --> 00:05:55,330
To this scenery and space.

129
00:05:56,350 --> 00:05:58,270
-It's actually bigger than I imagined.
-It is.

130
00:06:03,960 --> 00:06:08,520
I don't know why, but Oyakata just used a single sword to stab the bearded pirate.

131
00:06:08,520 --> 00:06:09,060
For real.

132
00:06:09,100 --> 00:06:11,710
That's so random...

133
00:06:11,760 --> 00:06:12,580
Why?

134
00:06:12,670 --> 00:06:13,150
I have no clue.

135
00:06:13,150 --> 00:06:13,440
-That's so random.
-Did he stab the barrel?
I have no clue.

136
00:06:13,440 --> 00:06:14,930
-That's so random.
-Did he stab the barrel?

137
00:06:15,090 --> 00:06:16,090
Why? He's all alone.

138
00:06:16,190 --> 00:06:17,080
I would have totally laughed if I'd seen that from a distance.

139
00:06:17,080 --> 00:06:18,180
He's doing all of that alone.
I would have totally laughed if I'd seen that from a distance.

140
00:06:18,840 --> 00:06:20,020
3 years is a long time...

141
00:06:20,240 --> 00:06:21,900
Yeah... Well...

142
00:06:23,250 --> 00:06:24,250
Did you guys meet 3 years ago?

143
00:06:24,500 --> 00:06:25,080
Yes, it was 3 years ago.

144
00:06:25,590 --> 00:06:26,120
A balloon?

145
00:06:26,620 --> 00:06:27,550
And it was in the middle of work too.

146
00:06:27,590 --> 00:06:29,580
It's a whoopee cushion!

147
00:06:29,940 --> 00:06:32,180
-Oyakata.
-He's inflating it a bit too much.

148
00:06:32,920 --> 00:06:34,680
That's such an old gag!

149
00:06:35,170 --> 00:06:37,040
And his lung capacity is zero!

150
00:06:38,980 --> 00:06:39,310
Musaka is nowhere to be seen.

151
00:06:39,310 --> 00:06:39,950
So slow!
Musaka is nowhere to be seen.

152
00:06:39,950 --> 00:06:40,570
Musaka is nowhere to be seen.

153
00:06:41,030 --> 00:06:42,180
He's so slow!

154
00:06:43,140 --> 00:06:44,920
-You're right.
-He's taking so long!

155
00:06:47,580 --> 00:06:48,420
He's going again.

156
00:06:49,600 --> 00:06:50,390
Oh no.

157
00:06:50,550 --> 00:06:51,280
He's dizzy!

158
00:06:51,850 --> 00:06:53,970
-What the heck is he doing?
-He's getting dizzy.

159
00:06:54,180 --> 00:06:54,480
So weak!

160
00:06:54,910 --> 00:06:56,650
He's so weak!

161
00:06:57,840 --> 00:06:59,550
I would have burst out laughing if I'd seen him.

162
00:06:59,910 --> 00:07:01,220
So? What's he gonna do now?

163
00:07:01,220 --> 00:07:02,550
What will he do?

164
00:07:02,870 --> 00:07:04,040
Who is gonna be the victim?

165
00:07:06,550 --> 00:07:07,880
-Oh, he's doing it himself.
-Right.

166
00:07:14,490 --> 00:07:16,780
He did it to himself and almost laughed!

167
00:07:17,110 --> 00:07:18,430
Oyakata, did you fart?

168
00:07:18,580 --> 00:07:18,880
Yes.

169
00:07:19,010 --> 00:07:19,550
I see.

170
00:07:20,920 --> 00:07:22,060
He asked: "Did you fart?"

171
00:07:22,130 --> 00:07:22,880
And he responded: "Yes."

172
00:07:24,320 --> 00:07:25,900
He did it to himself and almost laughed.

173
00:07:26,960 --> 00:07:28,680
But that was such a great sounding fart!

174
00:07:29,400 --> 00:07:32,790
I would have laughed ages ago! I would be totally useless in there.

175
00:07:33,110 --> 00:07:34,380
He should try it again!

176
00:07:34,380 --> 00:07:35,000
I would never be able to hold back there. They are all so good!
He should try it again!

177
00:07:35,000 --> 00:07:37,670
I would never be able to hold back there. They are all so good!

178
00:07:38,740 --> 00:07:39,280
- Looks like Katori is struggling too.

179
00:07:39,280 --> 00:07:40,620
- It's so hard!
- Looks like Katori is struggling too.

180
00:07:40,620 --> 00:07:40,740
- Looks like Katori is struggling too.

181
00:07:41,270 --> 00:07:42,850
He's going again!

182
00:07:42,930 --> 00:07:43,950
Whoopee cushion, second try.

183
00:07:43,950 --> 00:07:44,180
He's going again!
Whoopee cushion, second try.

184
00:07:44,180 --> 00:07:44,950
He's going again!

185
00:07:45,330 --> 00:07:46,980
Oyakata is crazy!

186
00:07:48,860 --> 00:07:50,380
Will I ever get comfortable in this room?

187
00:07:50,770 --> 00:07:52,280
Musaka is still gone.

188
00:07:53,030 --> 00:07:54,150
-What will he do next?
-He's quite heavy.

189
00:07:54,870 --> 00:07:55,730
He's quite heavy so it makes a great sound.

190
00:07:55,730 --> 00:07:56,160
He's inflating it again.
He's quite heavy so it makes a great sound.

191
00:07:56,160 --> 00:07:56,850
He's inflating it again.

192
00:07:57,620 --> 00:07:58,420
Is he gonna sit on it again?

193
00:08:01,060 --> 00:08:02,320
He's a big guy.

194
00:08:02,320 --> 00:08:02,670
It's gonna make a big sound.
He's a big guy.

195
00:08:02,670 --> 00:08:03,580
It's gonna make a big sound.

196
00:08:06,480 --> 00:08:07,200
It didn't do anything.

197
00:08:07,750 --> 00:08:08,130
It didn't.

198
00:08:08,130 --> 00:08:08,460
No one's even looking at him!
It didn't.

199
00:08:08,460 --> 00:08:09,270
No one's even looking at him!

200
00:08:09,370 --> 00:08:10,150
It didn't go off...

201
00:08:10,450 --> 00:08:11,680
No one heard it.

202
00:08:12,160 --> 00:08:12,770
The cushion!

203
00:08:12,810 --> 00:08:13,720
Kamiji is in trouble!

204
00:08:13,940 --> 00:08:15,270
It's not working!

205
00:08:16,100 --> 00:08:17,120
The cushion!

206
00:08:17,550 --> 00:08:18,750
Kamiji is in such trouble!

207
00:08:20,800 --> 00:08:22,850
They did so well not to laugh!

208
00:08:28,830 --> 00:08:29,350
Again?

209
00:08:29,670 --> 00:08:30,050
That's fine.

210
00:08:30,390 --> 00:08:32,260
-Right.
-But I think this is good for him.

211
00:08:34,020 --> 00:08:34,750
It's not working.

212
00:08:34,800 --> 00:08:35,650
He's got no lungs.

213
00:08:37,590 --> 00:08:40,290
But I think it's smart to capitalize here.

214
00:08:43,130 --> 00:08:44,020
He's still going.

215
00:08:44,720 --> 00:08:46,120
It's not inflating.

216
00:08:46,820 --> 00:08:48,120
Why can't he get it to inflate?

217
00:08:50,130 --> 00:08:52,060
Oyakata's whoopee cushion is not working.

218
00:08:52,920 --> 00:08:53,700
Oh really?

219
00:08:54,110 --> 00:08:55,850
I've been wondering about that.

220
00:08:56,980 --> 00:08:57,320
He got it.

221
00:08:57,460 --> 00:08:57,920
Oh, he's going for it.

222
00:08:59,170 --> 00:08:59,830
Again?

223
00:09:00,200 --> 00:09:01,450
It's already full!

224
00:09:01,450 --> 00:09:02,860
He's so slow!

225
00:09:02,910 --> 00:09:05,020
You can't inflate it anymore, man!

226
00:09:06,610 --> 00:09:07,610
-No way...
-Here it comes.

227
00:09:15,450 --> 00:09:16,220
He's gonna laugh!

228
00:09:16,560 --> 00:09:17,950
Someone's gotta laugh!

229
00:09:18,310 --> 00:09:19,250
It's not making a sound, huh?

230
00:09:19,610 --> 00:09:20,450
It's not.

231
00:09:20,450 --> 00:09:20,940
Nobody's laughing!
It's not.

232
00:09:20,940 --> 00:09:21,880
Nobody's laughing!

233
00:09:21,880 --> 00:09:22,410
Hiro! Look at Hiro!
Nobody's laughing!

234
00:09:22,410 --> 00:09:22,700
Hiro! Look at Hiro!

235
00:09:22,760 --> 00:09:23,380
Is he okay?

236
00:09:23,560 --> 00:09:24,420
He's running away.

237
00:09:25,980 --> 00:09:26,420
Hiro!

238
00:09:26,840 --> 00:09:28,220
Hiro is running away.

239
00:09:28,520 --> 00:09:29,610
It got torn off.

240
00:09:29,610 --> 00:09:30,280
It did?

241
00:09:30,360 --> 00:09:30,780
What?

242
00:09:30,880 --> 00:09:31,720
He's too heavy!

243
00:09:31,930 --> 00:09:32,750
The whoopee cushion broke?

244
00:09:32,850 --> 00:09:33,180
Yes.

245
00:09:33,350 --> 00:09:35,920
That's why he couldn't fully inflate it.

246
00:09:37,420 --> 00:09:38,770
I think it broke in the first try.

247
00:09:38,880 --> 00:09:39,560
Yeah...

248
00:09:40,520 --> 00:09:40,880
There he is.

249
00:09:49,020 --> 00:09:51,650
Truly! Truly funny!

250
00:09:52,790 --> 00:09:54,550
- Truly! Truly funny!

251
00:09:54,550 --> 00:09:54,880
- He did his research!
- Truly! Truly funny!

252
00:09:54,880 --> 00:09:55,350
- Takashi is in trouble!
- He did his research!
- Truly! Truly funny!

253
00:09:55,350 --> 00:09:56,780
- He did his research!
- Takashi is in trouble!

254
00:09:56,780 --> 00:09:56,860
- He did his research!

255
00:09:56,860 --> 00:09:57,320
- Evil eye!
- He did his research!

256
00:09:57,320 --> 00:09:58,080
- Evil eye!

257
00:09:59,140 --> 00:10:00,140
Evil eye!

258
00:10:01,300 --> 00:10:02,550
Evil eye!

259
00:10:03,280 --> 00:10:05,120
His appearance hasn't changed much.

260
00:10:05,820 --> 00:10:07,090
I mean, his face is the same.

261
00:10:07,150 --> 00:10:07,920
It really hasn't.

262
00:10:08,770 --> 00:10:10,840
I'm getting sleepy!

263
00:10:11,720 --> 00:10:12,430
Oyakata is in trouble.

264
00:10:12,430 --> 00:10:13,140
He really did his research.
Oyakata is in trouble.

265
00:10:13,140 --> 00:10:13,600
He really did his research.

266
00:10:19,830 --> 00:10:21,150
Evil eye!

267
00:10:22,130 --> 00:10:23,380
Evil eye!

268
00:10:23,720 --> 00:10:24,750
Evil eye!

269
00:10:24,750 --> 00:10:25,050
What was that?
Evil eye!

270
00:10:25,050 --> 00:10:25,180
What was that?

271
00:10:26,980 --> 00:10:28,050
What is he doing?

272
00:10:29,070 --> 00:10:30,480
Why is he hitting himself?

273
00:10:30,530 --> 00:10:31,530
He's so kind.

274
00:10:31,940 --> 00:10:34,060
I'm getting sleepy!

275
00:10:34,980 --> 00:10:35,550
Ouch!

276
00:10:41,210 --> 00:10:42,550
Who's that?

277
00:10:43,500 --> 00:10:44,440
Is he okay? Did he hold it in?

278
00:10:44,480 --> 00:10:46,450
-Katsu is in trouble!
-He's really going for it.

279
00:10:46,460 --> 00:10:47,490
Katsu didn't crack.

280
00:10:47,520 --> 00:10:48,480
Look at those tattoos.

281
00:10:49,420 --> 00:10:49,820
What?

282
00:10:50,230 --> 00:10:50,620
Who's that?

283
00:10:50,850 --> 00:10:51,930
- Katsunori was in trouble there.

284
00:10:51,930 --> 00:10:52,610
- And Oyakata too!
- Katsunori was in trouble there.

285
00:10:52,610 --> 00:10:52,780
- And Oyakata too!

286
00:10:52,780 --> 00:10:53,180
- That was close!
- And Oyakata too!

287
00:10:53,180 --> 00:10:53,620
- That was close!

288
00:10:55,090 --> 00:10:56,200
Kamiji was also about to crack.

289
00:10:58,260 --> 00:10:59,700
Have you been doing it for long?

290
00:11:00,080 --> 00:11:03,080
I started in my third year of high school.

291
00:11:03,180 --> 00:11:03,520
So, 3 years?

292
00:11:03,720 --> 00:11:04,860
You didn't do music before that?

293
00:11:05,120 --> 00:11:06,360
No, not at all.

294
00:11:06,950 --> 00:11:08,020
Oyakata is so proactive!

295
00:11:08,020 --> 00:11:08,430
He really is!
Oyakata is so proactive!

296
00:11:08,430 --> 00:11:08,920
He really is!

297
00:11:09,230 --> 00:11:09,880
You had no interest?

298
00:11:09,880 --> 00:11:10,280
-That's so surprising!
-He's very aggressive!
You had no interest?

299
00:11:10,280 --> 00:11:11,780
-That's so surprising!
-He's very aggressive!

300
00:11:11,920 --> 00:11:15,780
Well, I think I must have been in middle school...

301
00:11:15,780 --> 00:11:16,240
Again?!
Well, I think I must have been in middle school...

302
00:11:16,240 --> 00:11:16,960
Again?!

303
00:11:18,320 --> 00:11:19,520
He left, didn't he?

304
00:11:22,840 --> 00:11:23,980
He watched it!

305
00:11:23,980 --> 00:11:24,380
Right?

306
00:11:25,770 --> 00:11:26,650
He watched Documental!

307
00:11:31,880 --> 00:11:32,680
Can you play?

308
00:11:33,770 --> 00:11:34,180
Huh?

309
00:11:34,250 --> 00:11:34,980
-Kinda...
-Huh?

310
00:11:35,710 --> 00:11:36,950
-Oh, Oyakata is asking him.
-Please teach me.

311
00:11:37,870 --> 00:11:39,450
He's shining the spotlight on Hiro.

312
00:11:42,330 --> 00:11:45,080
-I didn't think he'd be so thoughtful.
-Me either.

313
00:11:49,250 --> 00:11:51,140
There's lots of different chords.

314
00:11:51,140 --> 00:11:51,600
Kazunori is still sleeping.
There's lots of different chords.

315
00:11:51,600 --> 00:11:52,380
Kazunori is still sleeping.

316
00:11:52,380 --> 00:11:52,540
Again?

317
00:11:52,540 --> 00:11:52,870
Can you teach me an easy one?
Again?

318
00:11:52,870 --> 00:11:53,460
Can you teach me an easy one?

319
00:11:53,950 --> 00:11:55,260
He really wants to do that gag.

320
00:11:55,380 --> 00:11:57,840
-He must have something up his sleeve!
-He really wants to do that gag.

321
00:11:57,880 --> 00:11:58,580
Here and here.

322
00:11:59,510 --> 00:12:00,960
You place your fingers here.

323
00:12:00,960 --> 00:12:03,880
And then you get a 'power chord'.

324
00:12:03,880 --> 00:12:04,250
Power chord?
And then you get a 'power chord'.

325
00:12:04,250 --> 00:12:04,700
Power chord?

326
00:12:04,780 --> 00:12:05,880
It's a really easy one.

327
00:12:06,660 --> 00:12:08,080
And then you can strum.

328
00:12:12,260 --> 00:12:12,780
Like this?

329
00:12:13,550 --> 00:12:15,980
Here and... This one's a bit hard...

330
00:12:16,460 --> 00:12:17,850
You leave one open and place your fingers here.

331
00:12:18,770 --> 00:12:20,250
Here and here.

332
00:12:20,320 --> 00:12:20,900
He's teaching him.

333
00:12:20,950 --> 00:12:21,380
Good.

334
00:12:23,940 --> 00:12:25,050
Oh, you've got it!

335
00:12:26,550 --> 00:12:27,280
Thank you.

336
00:12:28,060 --> 00:12:28,810
What was that?

337
00:12:31,360 --> 00:12:32,720
What the heck was that?

338
00:12:34,600 --> 00:12:36,310
What was that?!

339
00:12:36,450 --> 00:12:37,770
I thought he had something planned!

340
00:12:38,280 --> 00:12:39,150
And he just leaves.

341
00:12:39,830 --> 00:12:40,220
That's it?

342
00:12:41,140 --> 00:12:43,020
That was it.

343
00:12:43,980 --> 00:12:45,720
I see... I see...

344
00:12:46,010 --> 00:12:48,160
We've got tons of different gags coming up.

345
00:12:48,190 --> 00:12:48,780
Right.

346
00:12:49,410 --> 00:12:51,250
It hasn't even been 15 minutes yet.

347
00:12:51,590 --> 00:12:53,420
Hiro just can't move.

348
00:12:54,680 --> 00:12:55,470
Look at Musaka.

349
00:12:55,470 --> 00:12:55,750
Musaka is still going at it.
Look at Musaka.

350
00:12:55,750 --> 00:12:57,350
Musaka is still going at it.

351
00:13:01,680 --> 00:13:02,890
He looks the same.

352
00:13:02,890 --> 00:13:04,020
He really does.

353
00:13:04,390 --> 00:13:05,580
It was starting to hurt.

354
00:13:08,000 --> 00:13:10,490
It's been a while since I've seen you, Shingo.

355
00:13:11,260 --> 00:13:12,460
So I want to show you something cute.

356
00:13:12,690 --> 00:13:13,220
What is it?

357
00:13:13,790 --> 00:13:15,890
I have an amazing trick.

358
00:13:16,820 --> 00:13:17,900
Katsunori, look.

359
00:13:18,320 --> 00:13:19,940
Oyakata, please come and have a look.

360
00:13:20,080 --> 00:13:20,420
You go like this.

361
00:13:20,580 --> 00:13:21,220
Magic?

362
00:13:21,520 --> 00:13:22,900
This is really hard to pull off, you know?

363
00:13:23,920 --> 00:13:25,660
Here, I have a normal glass.

364
00:13:26,770 --> 00:13:28,120
Like Wes-P? (EN: 2)

365
00:13:28,820 --> 00:13:29,600
I think so.

366
00:13:29,600 --> 00:13:31,620
Or like 5Gap. (EN: 3)

367
00:13:33,650 --> 00:13:36,510
I'm a baldie so it slides right off my head.

368
00:13:36,820 --> 00:13:38,020
It's gonna be hard.
You gotta add some water.

369
00:13:38,020 --> 00:13:38,420
Right, he should add water.
It's gonna be hard.
You gotta add some water.

370
00:13:38,420 --> 00:13:39,320
Right, he should add water.

371
00:13:39,840 --> 00:13:40,680
Don't think he'll make it.

372
00:13:40,990 --> 00:13:41,750
Shingo, here I come.

373
00:13:45,480 --> 00:13:45,980
No way.

374
00:13:48,190 --> 00:13:49,280
I knew that would happen.

375
00:13:49,580 --> 00:13:50,900
Damn it!

376
00:13:50,900 --> 00:13:51,520
One more.

377
00:13:52,140 --> 00:13:53,660
It's pretty hard to pull off.

378
00:13:55,000 --> 00:13:55,700
Cause it's too light.

379
00:13:55,700 --> 00:13:57,380
Right, he has to add some weight.

380
00:13:58,010 --> 00:14:00,280
I can definitely do it.

381
00:14:00,390 --> 00:14:00,850
Really?

382
00:14:04,170 --> 00:14:05,650
No way... Can he really do it?

383
00:14:08,210 --> 00:14:08,780
Oh, he did it.

384
00:14:12,320 --> 00:14:13,280
Amazing.

385
00:14:14,780 --> 00:14:16,540
-That was amazing.
-Right? That's crazy.

386
00:14:17,050 --> 00:14:17,820
I didn't think you'd succeed.

387
00:14:17,820 --> 00:14:19,020
He did it... But so what?
I didn't think you'd succeed.

388
00:14:19,020 --> 00:14:19,060
He did it... But so what?

389
00:14:19,060 --> 00:14:19,500
Right?
He did it... But so what?

390
00:14:19,500 --> 00:14:19,520
Right?

391
00:14:19,520 --> 00:14:19,550
It's not funny at all.
Right?

392
00:14:19,550 --> 00:14:20,920
It's not funny at all.

393
00:14:23,180 --> 00:14:25,050
Musaka, please try it again with this.

394
00:14:25,050 --> 00:14:25,380
Really?

395
00:14:25,950 --> 00:14:26,480
This?

396
00:14:26,920 --> 00:14:27,580
Can I do it wearing this?

397
00:14:27,580 --> 00:14:27,920
Oh, the top...
Can I do it wearing this?

398
00:14:27,920 --> 00:14:28,440
Oh, the top...

399
00:14:29,270 --> 00:14:30,780
I don't think this is gonna work.

400
00:14:31,490 --> 00:14:32,320
It's not that different.

401
00:14:32,360 --> 00:14:33,190
I... Well...

402
00:14:34,810 --> 00:14:36,180
I don't know, but let's give it a shot.

403
00:14:36,250 --> 00:14:36,950
I don't think I can pull it off.

404
00:14:37,070 --> 00:14:38,200
This actually fits you perfectly.

405
00:14:39,600 --> 00:14:41,360
I mean, this part is the same.

406
00:14:41,540 --> 00:14:42,280
Oh, right.

407
00:14:42,370 --> 00:14:43,720
You think so?
Hold on...

408
00:14:43,890 --> 00:14:44,350
Okay.

409
00:14:44,740 --> 00:14:45,680
But it's plastic...

410
00:14:45,930 --> 00:14:47,280
I'll give it the good old try.

411
00:14:50,590 --> 00:14:51,050
Huh?

412
00:14:51,630 --> 00:14:53,220
It fell off already?

413
00:14:54,320 --> 00:14:55,780
It's not staying on, right?

414
00:14:56,420 --> 00:14:57,820
What's this sound?

415
00:14:59,150 --> 00:14:59,980
It's like a Sumo Jinku. (EN: 4)

416
00:14:59,980 --> 00:15:00,430
It really sounds like that.
It's like a Sumo Jinku. (EN: 4)

417
00:15:00,430 --> 00:15:00,890
It really sounds like that.

418
00:15:00,890 --> 00:15:01,260
Which means...
It really sounds like that.

419
00:15:01,260 --> 00:15:02,120
Which means...

420
00:15:03,840 --> 00:15:04,330
Oyakata?

421
00:15:09,730 --> 00:15:10,410
It fell off.

422
00:15:10,870 --> 00:15:12,470
I knew it couldn't be done.

423
00:15:13,660 --> 00:15:14,180
I knew it.

424
00:15:14,860 --> 00:15:15,880
My own head is way better.

425
00:15:15,910 --> 00:15:16,580
He's making funny faces!

426
00:15:16,860 --> 00:15:17,450
Funny faces!

427
00:15:18,800 --> 00:15:19,620
Funny faces?!

428
00:15:20,230 --> 00:15:22,200
It's funny faces after the whoopee cushion?!

429
00:15:23,960 --> 00:15:25,920
And he's got the worst comedic timing, too!

430
00:15:25,950 --> 00:15:26,550
Right?

431
00:15:26,880 --> 00:15:27,900
He should have done it at the end of the song!

432
00:15:27,900 --> 00:15:28,460
I thought he called me.
He should have done it at the end of the song!

433
00:15:28,460 --> 00:15:29,860
I thought he called me.

434
00:15:31,310 --> 00:15:33,500
This might be a disadvantage for him.

435
00:15:33,500 --> 00:15:34,340
Right.

436
00:15:34,350 --> 00:15:35,370
Oh, the next one, right?

437
00:15:35,670 --> 00:15:36,120
The next one.

438
00:15:36,210 --> 00:15:36,690
Here it comes.

439
00:15:37,250 --> 00:15:38,150
-Oh you're right.
-You're right.

440
00:15:39,370 --> 00:15:40,700
He's got it all planned out.

441
00:15:42,750 --> 00:15:43,200
Funny face.

442
00:15:43,230 --> 00:15:44,700
-It's just another series of funny faces.
-Right.

443
00:15:44,800 --> 00:15:45,580
It's funny faces.

444
00:15:48,370 --> 00:15:50,320
He's pretty old school, isn't he?

445
00:15:50,320 --> 00:15:50,330
Like he was only allowed to joke around in his elementary school days.
He's pretty old school, isn't he?

446
00:15:50,330 --> 00:15:52,330
Like he was only allowed to joke around in his elementary school days.

447
00:15:53,240 --> 00:15:54,290
Oyakata?

448
00:15:54,500 --> 00:15:54,950
Oyakata?

449
00:15:56,950 --> 00:15:58,460
Does he think that's funny?

450
00:15:58,460 --> 00:15:58,720
Right.
Does he think that's funny?

451
00:15:58,720 --> 00:15:59,210
Right.

452
00:15:59,230 --> 00:16:00,440
Those faces are not funny at all!

453
00:16:02,580 --> 00:16:04,220
I mean, that's the funny part for us.

454
00:16:04,220 --> 00:16:05,380
I wish he'd stop.

455
00:16:05,380 --> 00:16:05,640
Right, he should have stopped.
I wish he'd stop.

456
00:16:05,640 --> 00:16:06,740
Right, he should have stopped.

457
00:16:07,080 --> 00:16:07,940
He's done?!

458
00:16:07,940 --> 00:16:08,460
He was very expressive in the ring.
He's done?!

459
00:16:08,460 --> 00:16:09,240
He was very expressive in the ring.

460
00:16:09,960 --> 00:16:11,350
I used to watch his matches.

461
00:16:11,350 --> 00:16:11,360
Thank you!
I used to watch his matches.

462
00:16:11,360 --> 00:16:12,120
Thank you!

463
00:16:14,110 --> 00:16:14,980
That was very precious.

464
00:16:15,550 --> 00:16:16,480
Thank you.

465
00:16:17,610 --> 00:16:19,060
Were you doing impressions?

466
00:16:19,580 --> 00:16:19,850
No.

467
00:16:20,200 --> 00:16:20,950
I was making funny faces.

468
00:16:20,980 --> 00:16:21,550
Funny faces?

469
00:16:21,620 --> 00:16:22,910
-Yes.
-He's brought that thing out again.

470
00:16:23,040 --> 00:16:24,460
Isn't it broken already?

471
00:16:24,530 --> 00:16:25,080
You don't have to.

472
00:16:25,200 --> 00:16:26,290
It doesn't make a sound anymore, does it?

473
00:16:26,480 --> 00:16:26,970
Alright.

474
00:16:27,220 --> 00:16:27,780
It's fine.

475
00:16:28,430 --> 00:16:29,670
-It's already broken.
-It's broken.

476
00:16:35,260 --> 00:16:38,100
Oyakata and Musaka's gags overlapped.

477
00:16:38,170 --> 00:16:38,660
Right.

478
00:16:38,780 --> 00:16:39,790
Right, right, right.

479
00:16:39,850 --> 00:16:40,520
Right, the timings.

480
00:16:40,520 --> 00:16:40,970
With this?
Right, the timings.

481
00:16:40,970 --> 00:16:40,980
With this?

482
00:16:41,050 --> 00:16:43,560
Yes. Oyakata did his funny faces as you were about to do your trick.

483
00:16:43,560 --> 00:16:44,210
Oh my.

484
00:16:44,210 --> 00:16:46,320
Then, I should have waited for Oyakata to do his act first.

485
00:16:50,850 --> 00:16:53,430
-I would have totally cracked up if it was me in there.
-Yeah, me too.

486
00:16:53,900 --> 00:16:54,380
Right?

487
00:16:54,410 --> 00:16:55,180
Those funny faces, man.

488
00:16:55,280 --> 00:16:56,920
He's going full offensive.

489
00:16:58,660 --> 00:16:59,420
Katsunori's sleeping.

490
00:17:00,060 --> 00:17:00,720
Look at Katsunori.

491
00:17:01,180 --> 00:17:03,520
Katsunori is trying that thing again?

492
00:17:03,520 --> 00:17:04,090
Look at him! Look at him!
Katsunori is trying that thing again?

493
00:17:04,090 --> 00:17:04,280
Look at him! Look at him!

494
00:17:04,280 --> 00:17:04,580
What is he waiting for?
Look at him! Look at him!

495
00:17:04,580 --> 00:17:05,280
What is he waiting for?

496
00:17:05,280 --> 00:17:07,160
He really wants to do this.

497
00:17:08,280 --> 00:17:10,250
He can't get started if he doesn't get this one done.

498
00:17:10,250 --> 00:17:10,740
Right, he can't quite move forward.
He can't get started if he doesn't get this one done.

499
00:17:10,740 --> 00:17:11,640
Right, he can't quite move forward.

500
00:17:11,670 --> 00:17:13,070
You know, this is his third attempt.

501
00:17:13,630 --> 00:17:15,380
He has to do it now.
Everyone's here.

502
00:17:15,380 --> 00:17:15,760
Guys, you have to watch him.
He's about to do something.
He has to do it now.
Everyone's here.

503
00:17:15,760 --> 00:17:16,960
Guys, you have to watch him.
He's about to do something.

504
00:17:16,980 --> 00:17:17,650
Are you sleepy?

505
00:17:17,900 --> 00:17:18,850
Yeah...

506
00:17:19,820 --> 00:17:20,220
I am.

507
00:17:20,790 --> 00:17:21,380
Are you okay?

508
00:17:22,120 --> 00:17:24,510
I guess it's just my age...

509
00:17:24,690 --> 00:17:27,020
I just end up waking up way too early in the morning.

510
00:17:28,130 --> 00:17:29,390
Oyakata is making some moves.

511
00:17:29,510 --> 00:17:30,330
I'm just really sleepy.

512
00:17:30,420 --> 00:17:31,960
Especially yesterday, I couldn't really sleep.

513
00:17:32,380 --> 00:17:33,190
I woke up at 2 a.m.

514
00:17:33,250 --> 00:17:33,700
What?!

515
00:17:33,800 --> 00:17:34,280
What?!

516
00:17:34,730 --> 00:17:35,700
I think I was way too nervous.

517
00:17:36,000 --> 00:17:36,880
They're playing along pretty nicely.

518
00:17:36,880 --> 00:17:37,560
You were awake all this time?

519
00:17:37,560 --> 00:17:38,160
Yeah.

520
00:17:38,400 --> 00:17:38,700
Oh my...

521
00:17:38,700 --> 00:17:40,460
-Eye medicine!
-Oh, here it comes!

522
00:17:43,250 --> 00:17:43,980
He wanted to do this!

523
00:17:45,300 --> 00:17:46,850
Why'd he want to do this bit that badly?

524
00:17:48,390 --> 00:17:49,020
You see, I...

525
00:17:49,580 --> 00:17:50,030
I have small eyes.

526
00:17:50,030 --> 00:17:50,720
We still don't know what it's about!
I have small eyes.

527
00:17:50,720 --> 00:17:51,220
We still don't know what it's about!

528
00:17:51,220 --> 00:17:51,530
You're right.
We still don't know what it's about!

529
00:17:51,530 --> 00:17:52,050
You're right.

530
00:17:52,530 --> 00:17:53,050
Slim eyes?

531
00:17:53,440 --> 00:17:54,080
Yeah.

532
00:17:54,540 --> 00:17:55,180
He's got slim eyes?

533
00:17:56,260 --> 00:17:57,460
He's having trouble because of his slim eyes?!

534
00:17:57,460 --> 00:18:00,000
I shake so badly every time I do this.

535
00:18:00,120 --> 00:18:01,320
Like this.

536
00:18:02,260 --> 00:18:02,580
Want some?

537
00:18:02,600 --> 00:18:03,450
Oh no thank you, I'm fine.

538
00:18:05,060 --> 00:18:07,040
You know, I was very close to Mitsuo Senda. (Japanese VA)

539
00:18:07,350 --> 00:18:07,680
Right.

540
00:18:07,760 --> 00:18:09,750
I heard he was pretty close to your dad, right?

541
00:18:10,120 --> 00:18:10,600
That's right.

542
00:18:10,600 --> 00:18:12,350
And he's also friends with Director Nagashima. (Shigeo Nagashima)

543
00:18:12,630 --> 00:18:13,820
Oh, that's right.

544
00:18:14,030 --> 00:18:17,730
And Senda was always the MC for Director Nagashima's events.

545
00:18:18,230 --> 00:18:18,550
Right?

546
00:18:18,660 --> 00:18:20,170
-And your dad used to sing.
-That's right, that's right.

547
00:18:20,170 --> 00:18:22,930
Musaka, please wear this for a sec.

548
00:18:23,000 --> 00:18:24,090
Oh, you'll apply the eye drops with that?

549
00:18:24,110 --> 00:18:24,850
Right, right.

550
00:18:25,250 --> 00:18:25,630
How is it?

551
00:18:26,060 --> 00:18:27,250
The drops will be easier to apply.

552
00:18:27,550 --> 00:18:28,050
Right.

553
00:18:28,170 --> 00:18:28,800
Right.

554
00:18:29,050 --> 00:18:30,710
Let's try this again.

555
00:18:30,880 --> 00:18:31,880
I'll put this on.

556
00:18:32,180 --> 00:18:32,920
Again.

557
00:18:32,920 --> 00:18:33,050
Place it on top.
Again.

558
00:18:33,050 --> 00:18:33,630
Place it on top.

559
00:18:35,140 --> 00:18:35,670
What's that?

560
00:18:36,180 --> 00:18:36,550
Huh?

561
00:18:39,320 --> 00:18:40,100
It's Gokigenyou. (EN: 5)

562
00:18:40,240 --> 00:18:45,410
-We haven't really talked much so...
-That brings me back.

563
00:18:45,530 --> 00:18:51,370
So I thought we'd play this game and get to know each other better.

564
00:18:51,540 --> 00:18:51,980
Okay!

565
00:18:53,210 --> 00:18:54,550
Who should go first?

566
00:18:55,610 --> 00:18:57,080
You should pick.

567
00:18:57,140 --> 00:18:57,850
Oh, then...

568
00:18:58,760 --> 00:18:59,360
Then...

569
00:18:59,960 --> 00:19:03,700
I think we should go clockwise.

570
00:19:03,700 --> 00:19:04,030
I'm starting?
I think we should go clockwise.

571
00:19:04,030 --> 00:19:04,420
I'm starting?

572
00:19:04,420 --> 00:19:04,770
Yes.

573
00:19:04,780 --> 00:19:05,100
Alright.

574
00:19:05,120 --> 00:19:05,450
Alright.

575
00:19:05,890 --> 00:19:06,520
Let's start!

576
00:19:06,910 --> 00:19:07,350
Okay!

577
00:19:08,280 --> 00:19:09,320
Alright, here I go!

578
00:19:09,370 --> 00:19:10,890
What will it be?

579
00:19:10,970 --> 00:19:12,440
-What will it be?
-What will it be?

580
00:19:13,570 --> 00:19:14,690
Out of the bat?!

581
00:19:14,690 --> 00:19:15,230
Alright!

582
00:19:16,370 --> 00:19:17,130
Talk about poop!

583
00:19:17,310 --> 00:19:17,650
Talk about poop?

584
00:19:17,650 --> 00:19:18,380
-In short: Poop Talk!
-Poop Talk!
Talk about poop?

585
00:19:18,380 --> 00:19:20,010
-In short: Poop Talk!
-Poop Talk!

586
00:19:21,460 --> 00:19:22,150
I'm so sorry.

587
00:19:22,710 --> 00:19:25,950
But I mean, you can talk about anything as long as it has something to do with poop.

588
00:19:26,230 --> 00:19:27,420
-Something to do with poop?
-Right.

589
00:19:27,790 --> 00:19:29,300
Oyakata might be weak to this, don't you think?

590
00:19:29,980 --> 00:19:30,920
It's childish humor.

591
00:19:30,920 --> 00:19:30,930
Right, he might crack.
It's childish humor.

592
00:19:30,930 --> 00:19:31,850
Right, he might crack.

593
00:19:31,850 --> 00:19:32,220
He seems like the type.
Right, he might crack.

594
00:19:32,220 --> 00:19:33,050
He seems like the type.

595
00:19:33,480 --> 00:19:34,480
Let's see...

596
00:19:35,210 --> 00:19:36,400
Hiro is our top batter!

597
00:19:36,410 --> 00:19:37,200
I...

598
00:19:39,050 --> 00:19:42,250
Well, I only do this at home but...

599
00:19:43,200 --> 00:19:51,000
I have this unconventional way of going to the bathroom.

600
00:19:51,780 --> 00:19:54,770
So, you know how there are those Japanese toilets? (EN: 6)

601
00:19:55,140 --> 00:19:59,050
Well, since I was a child I have always been more used to Japanese-style toilets.

602
00:19:59,080 --> 00:20:02,820
I was taught how to use a Japanese-style toilet first, so I guess that's why.

603
00:20:03,330 --> 00:20:07,960
So I have to poop Japanese-style even in western-style toilets.

604
00:20:09,390 --> 00:20:09,940
You climb on it?

605
00:20:10,240 --> 00:20:10,980
I do.

606
00:20:11,560 --> 00:20:12,230
On the toilet seat?

607
00:20:12,310 --> 00:20:13,050
Yes, on the toilet seat.

608
00:20:13,530 --> 00:20:14,890
I mean, I don't do it outside my home.

609
00:20:15,170 --> 00:20:15,780
Right, right.

610
00:20:16,400 --> 00:20:18,560
I just do it at home where I feel at ease.

611
00:20:19,980 --> 00:20:22,740
But I do hear of this from time to time.

612
00:20:22,960 --> 00:20:25,200
Of people who were raised with Japanese-style toilets.

613
00:20:25,530 --> 00:20:26,150
So...

614
00:20:26,680 --> 00:20:32,820
Actually, one time I was at a friend's place and as I opened the door to the toilet I saw his girlfriend holding onto the toilet tank.

615
00:20:33,380 --> 00:20:33,920
She was doing it.

616
00:20:35,660 --> 00:20:38,740
She was holding onto the toilet bowl and doing it facing the other way.

617
00:20:39,070 --> 00:20:40,810
I ended up seeing that by accident.

618
00:20:40,810 --> 00:20:40,940
Facing the bowl?
I ended up seeing that by accident.

619
00:20:40,940 --> 00:20:41,940
Facing the bowl?

620
00:20:42,150 --> 00:20:42,950
Right, facing the bowl.

621
00:20:43,240 --> 00:20:43,520
Yes.

622
00:20:44,190 --> 00:20:45,290
Do you also face the other way?

623
00:20:45,300 --> 00:20:46,300
Yes, I do.

624
00:20:46,930 --> 00:20:48,150
I see...

625
00:20:48,250 --> 00:20:48,490
Yes.

626
00:20:48,490 --> 00:20:48,640
Cause the Japanese-style toilet is facing that way.
Yes.

627
00:20:48,640 --> 00:20:50,250
Cause the Japanese-style toilet is facing that way.

628
00:20:51,750 --> 00:20:52,640
So I can't do it.

629
00:20:52,800 --> 00:20:54,380
Musaka has a grim look on his face.

630
00:20:55,920 --> 00:20:56,790
Thank you for that story.

631
00:20:56,910 --> 00:20:57,780
Sure, sorry...

632
00:20:58,010 --> 00:20:58,780
Thank you.

633
00:20:58,860 --> 00:20:59,450
Thank you.

634
00:20:59,830 --> 00:21:01,740
Alright, now it's Shingo's turn.

635
00:21:02,850 --> 00:21:03,280
Is Oyakata okay?

636
00:21:03,280 --> 00:21:03,660
Please go ahead.
Is Oyakata okay?

637
00:21:03,660 --> 00:21:04,080
Please go ahead.

638
00:21:04,080 --> 00:21:04,660
He looks fine to me.
Please go ahead.

639
00:21:04,660 --> 00:21:04,980
He looks fine to me.

640
00:21:05,080 --> 00:21:05,860
Here it goes.

641
00:21:07,670 --> 00:21:09,450
What will it be?
Ouch!

642
00:21:09,650 --> 00:21:10,180
Sorry!

643
00:21:10,220 --> 00:21:11,720
-What will it be?
-Are you alright?

644
00:21:13,590 --> 00:21:14,660
-Dance!
-Dance!

645
00:21:15,290 --> 00:21:16,150
Dance?!

646
00:21:16,710 --> 00:21:17,150
Sorry.

647
00:21:17,160 --> 00:21:17,910
It's fine, don't worry about it.

648
00:21:17,920 --> 00:21:19,450
-This is...
-Sorry!

649
00:21:19,610 --> 00:21:20,020
It's fine.

650
00:21:20,410 --> 00:21:21,550
This is actually your expertise.

651
00:21:21,550 --> 00:21:22,320
You're a pro.

652
00:21:22,480 --> 00:21:26,680
So with this one you have to do a dance.

653
00:21:26,740 --> 00:21:28,210
I'll play some music.

654
00:21:28,540 --> 00:21:30,230
So we'd like to see your dancing skills.

655
00:21:31,280 --> 00:21:32,620
He's pretty good.

656
00:21:32,710 --> 00:21:33,160
Alright.

657
00:21:33,200 --> 00:21:33,580
Right?

658
00:21:34,280 --> 00:21:34,830
Let's go with this song.

659
00:21:34,830 --> 00:21:36,250
I mean, of course he's good at dancing!
Let's go with this song.

660
00:21:36,250 --> 00:21:36,850
Let's go with this song.

661
00:21:37,580 --> 00:21:38,580
He sure is!

662
00:21:39,720 --> 00:21:40,620
Can he do it?

663
00:21:54,680 --> 00:21:55,250
He's dancing!

664
00:21:55,350 --> 00:21:55,920
He's mixing in!

665
00:21:59,210 --> 00:21:59,850
Everyone's in!

666
00:22:03,280 --> 00:22:03,980
Even Oyakata.

667
00:22:06,190 --> 00:22:06,950
This is wonderful.

668
00:22:09,060 --> 00:22:10,120
But the song is over...

669
00:22:10,140 --> 00:22:10,680
The song is over!

670
00:22:10,680 --> 00:22:11,220
That's it.

671
00:22:11,240 --> 00:22:11,950
Thank you.

672
00:22:12,680 --> 00:22:14,750
That was quite something!

673
00:22:16,440 --> 00:22:17,650
They're doing something.

674
00:22:20,310 --> 00:22:21,750
-They're still going.
-They are.

675
00:22:22,140 --> 00:22:22,950
It's like Usain Bolt's pose.

676
00:22:25,810 --> 00:22:28,160
-Whoa, something's happening.
-Yeah!

677
00:22:28,820 --> 00:22:29,820
A dance battle?

678
00:22:29,930 --> 00:22:30,610
Very exciting!

679
00:22:33,900 --> 00:22:34,650
I see!

680
00:22:39,670 --> 00:22:41,150
They're going all out!

681
00:22:55,740 --> 00:22:56,780
That was wonderful.

682
00:22:57,610 --> 00:22:58,580
Thank you!

683
00:22:58,580 --> 00:22:59,280
Thanks!

684
00:22:59,480 --> 00:23:00,520
A pro dancer...

685
00:23:00,920 --> 00:23:02,580
-Shingo's a very good dancer, isn't he?
-Totally.

686
00:23:02,580 --> 00:23:03,080
Very good!

687
00:23:03,080 --> 00:23:03,260
That was fun.
Very good!

688
00:23:03,260 --> 00:23:04,240
That was fun.

689
00:23:04,920 --> 00:23:06,330
-Alright Yusuke, it's your turn.
-Yes!

690
00:23:06,410 --> 00:23:07,690
-Please go ahead.
-Yes!

691
00:23:08,650 --> 00:23:10,460
He's starting to move.

692
00:23:11,760 --> 00:23:13,430
What will it be?

693
00:23:16,510 --> 00:23:18,350
Whoa, this is a hard one.

694
00:23:18,450 --> 00:23:19,020
What is it?

695
00:23:19,720 --> 00:23:21,090
Talk about Hitoshi Matsumoto.

696
00:23:21,130 --> 00:23:23,520
-In short: Matsu Talk!
-Matsu Talk!

697
00:23:23,660 --> 00:23:24,680
It's the first time I heard that term.

698
00:23:25,250 --> 00:23:27,480
Please tell us a story about Matsumoto.

699
00:23:27,870 --> 00:23:28,480
Does he even have any?

700
00:23:29,320 --> 00:23:31,470
I've only ever worked with him though...

701
00:23:31,470 --> 00:23:31,870
Right.

702
00:23:31,870 --> 00:23:33,680
You should have tons of funny stories about your time working together.

703
00:23:34,340 --> 00:23:38,020
Well sure, we've been working on that show for a while.

704
00:23:42,000 --> 00:23:43,550
But a story about Matsumoto?

705
00:23:43,950 --> 00:23:45,250
He doesn't have any!

706
00:23:45,250 --> 00:23:47,920
Actually, has anyone here met him in their private time?

707
00:23:49,010 --> 00:23:49,780
Oh, he's dodging the question.

708
00:23:49,790 --> 00:23:51,530
I have seen you around plenty of times.

709
00:23:51,540 --> 00:23:53,010
He must have really had zero stories about Matsumoto.

710
00:23:53,020 --> 00:23:54,010
He must have no stories to tell.

711
00:23:54,010 --> 00:23:54,230
Ehm...
He must have no stories to tell.

712
00:23:54,230 --> 00:23:55,090
Ehm...

713
00:23:55,500 --> 00:24:01,280
I actually saw him in the park near my former place.
He was actually wearing a mask.

714
00:24:02,270 --> 00:24:07,570
He wore a black knit hat, with a black jumper and black pants.

715
00:24:07,930 --> 00:24:12,120
His outfit was exactly that of Toshio Kurosawa. (EN: 7)

716
00:24:13,860 --> 00:24:19,150
I saw him gently pushing a girl on the swings.

717
00:24:19,250 --> 00:24:20,590
Did he have that 'celebrity' atmosphere?

718
00:24:20,620 --> 00:24:21,780
He did.

719
00:24:21,940 --> 00:24:23,880
I think everyone knew right off the bat who he was.

720
00:24:24,420 --> 00:24:30,540
Now that I think about it, I did get some pictures taken with Matsumoto.

721
00:24:30,570 --> 00:24:31,050
Pictures?

722
00:24:31,170 --> 00:24:33,420
Hold on, I have my phone here so I'll show you.

723
00:24:33,760 --> 00:24:34,110
Is that okay?

724
00:24:34,190 --> 00:24:34,650
Sure.

725
00:24:35,120 --> 00:24:37,640
I do remember taking some pictures with him after a shoot.

726
00:24:39,550 --> 00:24:40,950
Let's watch it over there.

727
00:24:40,990 --> 00:24:41,420
The TV?

728
00:24:42,200 --> 00:24:43,720
Yeah, he's gonna mirror it to the monitor.

729
00:24:43,910 --> 00:24:44,680
Oh, right, right.

730
00:24:44,810 --> 00:24:45,320
Let's see the picture.

731
00:24:45,830 --> 00:24:48,650
I think it was after Deluxe...

732
00:24:49,250 --> 00:24:50,350
It was a while back.

733
00:24:50,440 --> 00:24:51,760
He's gotta have something prepared.

734
00:24:51,760 --> 00:24:53,020
-It does seem kinda fishy.
-Right?

735
00:24:53,020 --> 00:24:56,020
But he sure set it up nicely after rolling that dice.

736
00:24:56,020 --> 00:24:57,280
Right? He remembered.

737
00:24:57,540 --> 00:24:58,630
Did you take this off camera?

738
00:24:58,900 --> 00:24:59,120
Yes.

739
00:25:04,590 --> 00:25:05,120
No way...

740
00:25:05,690 --> 00:25:06,050
No way.

741
00:25:06,360 --> 00:25:07,360
No, no, no.

742
00:25:07,370 --> 00:25:08,560
No, no, it's Shuchishin. (EN: 8)

743
00:25:08,560 --> 00:25:09,350
Why is Tsuruno here? (JP Talent)

744
00:25:09,350 --> 00:25:09,820
That's Takeshi Tsuruno!
Why is Tsuruno here? (JP Talent)

745
00:25:09,820 --> 00:25:10,320
That's Takeshi Tsuruno!

746
00:25:14,680 --> 00:25:15,120
Huh?

747
00:25:15,680 --> 00:25:17,480
He's struggling!

748
00:25:17,520 --> 00:25:18,540
He's really struggling!

749
00:25:19,450 --> 00:25:20,670
It just keeps going.

750
00:25:20,670 --> 00:25:21,260
What the heck is this?!
It just keeps going.

751
00:25:21,260 --> 00:25:21,920
What the heck is this?!

752
00:25:21,950 --> 00:25:22,580
It just keeps going.

753
00:25:22,580 --> 00:25:23,530
Was Matsumoto blonde back then?
It just keeps going.

754
00:25:23,530 --> 00:25:24,250
Was Matsumoto blonde back then?

755
00:25:24,810 --> 00:25:25,120
It's Shuchishin and Matsumoto!

756
00:25:25,120 --> 00:25:25,720
Yes, at the time he was.
It's Shuchishin and Matsumoto!

757
00:25:25,720 --> 00:25:26,530
It's Shuchishin and Matsumoto!

758
00:25:26,780 --> 00:25:27,620
I think it was for a role.

759
00:25:27,880 --> 00:25:29,110
Hold on, Oyakata is in trouble!

760
00:25:29,110 --> 00:25:29,620
He's got some nice pecs!
Hold on, Oyakata is in trouble!

761
00:25:29,620 --> 00:25:30,480
He's got some nice pecs!

762
00:25:31,000 --> 00:25:32,040
Oyakata is about to crack.

763
00:25:32,040 --> 00:25:32,310
He's trying really hard.
Oyakata is about to crack.

764
00:25:32,310 --> 00:25:33,730
He's trying really hard.

765
00:25:34,160 --> 00:25:35,330
Oyakata is in trouble!

766
00:25:36,840 --> 00:25:38,280
It doesn't stop, does it?

767
00:25:38,630 --> 00:25:39,820
I think it was their debut song.

768
00:25:40,480 --> 00:25:41,550
He was there, huh?

769
00:25:41,640 --> 00:25:42,800
But the group was unbalanced.

770
00:25:43,840 --> 00:25:45,630
He must have prepared for this.

771
00:25:45,690 --> 00:25:47,530
Matsumoto was also part of the Hexagon family?

772
00:25:47,560 --> 00:25:48,160
That's right.

773
00:25:48,160 --> 00:25:48,350
I see.
That's right.

774
00:25:48,350 --> 00:25:49,050
I see.

775
00:25:49,530 --> 00:25:50,080
Liar!

776
00:25:51,420 --> 00:25:52,920
But that's the only photo I have.

777
00:25:53,030 --> 00:25:54,350
-That was great.
-Thanks.

778
00:25:54,430 --> 00:25:55,890
Nobody broke!

779
00:25:55,890 --> 00:25:56,380
Right?!

780
00:25:56,480 --> 00:25:57,960
They all did so well!

781
00:25:57,960 --> 00:25:59,480
He must have been waiting for this exact moment to show those pictures!

782
00:25:59,520 --> 00:25:59,780
Yeah, he probably figured this was as good a time as any.

783
00:25:59,780 --> 00:26:01,160
Musaka, could you go next?
Yeah, he probably figured this was as good a time as any.

784
00:26:01,160 --> 00:26:01,430
Oh, me?
Musaka, could you go next?
Yeah, he probably figured this was as good a time as any.

785
00:26:01,430 --> 00:26:01,850
Yeah, he probably figured this was as good a time as any.
Oh, me?

786
00:26:01,850 --> 00:26:02,380
Yeah, he probably figured this was as good a time as any.

787
00:26:02,920 --> 00:26:03,450
Alright.

788
00:26:03,460 --> 00:26:04,520
Please roll the dice.

789
00:26:04,520 --> 00:26:09,650
You know I actually won the Grand Prize of the year when Kosakai was still the host. (Kazuki Kosakai)

790
00:26:10,540 --> 00:26:12,430
I won the "Sad Story" section.

791
00:26:13,400 --> 00:26:16,320
-The sad story, huh?
-I still have my trophy at home.

792
00:26:17,460 --> 00:26:19,200
-It was a proper trophy made of glass.
-That's amazing.

793
00:26:19,660 --> 00:26:20,860
Okay guys, sing!

794
00:26:21,690 --> 00:26:23,180
-What will it be?
-What will it be?

795
00:26:31,180 --> 00:26:31,620
What is it?

796
00:26:32,580 --> 00:26:33,650
Dance again.

797
00:26:33,700 --> 00:26:34,920
Whoa, here we go!

798
00:26:34,940 --> 00:26:36,720
-Dance!
-Dance!

799
00:26:36,780 --> 00:26:36,810
It's dancing again!

800
00:26:36,810 --> 00:26:37,540
Musaka's dancing, huh?
It's dancing again!

801
00:26:37,540 --> 00:26:37,720
Musaka's dancing, huh?

802
00:26:37,720 --> 00:26:38,220
I can't dance...
Musaka's dancing, huh?

803
00:26:38,220 --> 00:26:39,460
I can't dance...

804
00:26:39,950 --> 00:26:43,020
What kind of music should I play?

805
00:26:44,420 --> 00:26:45,750
I can't dance like Shingo, you know?

806
00:26:45,830 --> 00:26:46,180
Sure...

807
00:26:46,260 --> 00:26:47,600
I don't even know the basics of dancing...

808
00:26:48,480 --> 00:26:49,050
That's good.

809
00:26:50,040 --> 00:26:51,400
H-How do you dance to this kind of music?

810
00:26:52,750 --> 00:26:53,520
Go with the flow!

811
00:26:53,680 --> 00:26:54,220
That's great.

812
00:27:02,310 --> 00:27:03,720
That's funny!

813
00:27:04,250 --> 00:27:05,290
That's so funny!

814
00:27:05,570 --> 00:27:06,590
I would totally crack!

815
00:27:06,590 --> 00:27:06,870
Me too!
I would totally crack!

816
00:27:06,870 --> 00:27:07,850
Me too!

817
00:27:07,850 --> 00:27:09,010
That's hilarious.

818
00:27:09,670 --> 00:27:12,050
I would have laughed ages ago!

819
00:27:12,920 --> 00:27:13,920
Any normal person would laugh at this!

820
00:27:13,920 --> 00:27:14,290
He's trying really hard.
Any normal person would laugh at this!

821
00:27:14,290 --> 00:27:15,780
He's trying really hard.

822
00:27:16,050 --> 00:27:17,520
No one's laughing.

823
00:27:18,970 --> 00:27:20,920
Whoa, it's just like those glasses he had!

824
00:27:21,030 --> 00:27:22,300
Been a while since we last saw this!

825
00:27:22,820 --> 00:27:23,650
That was amazing.

826
00:27:23,720 --> 00:27:24,120
Thank you!

827
00:27:24,280 --> 00:27:26,650
-Thank you!
-Good job!

828
00:27:27,260 --> 00:27:28,930
I can't believe no one laughed!

829
00:27:29,450 --> 00:27:30,320
I did my best.

830
00:27:30,320 --> 00:27:30,540
It was pretty good though.
I did my best.

831
00:27:30,540 --> 00:27:31,320
It was pretty good though.

832
00:27:31,320 --> 00:27:31,440
It sure was!
It was pretty good though.

833
00:27:31,440 --> 00:27:32,320
Oyakata, could you roll the dice now?
It sure was!

834
00:27:32,320 --> 00:27:33,290
Oyakata, could you roll the dice now?

835
00:27:33,380 --> 00:27:33,550
Yes.

836
00:27:34,190 --> 00:27:36,380
Okay, let's go.

837
00:27:36,870 --> 00:27:37,890
What will it be?

838
00:27:37,890 --> 00:27:38,410
Ah, sorry.
What will it be?

839
00:27:38,410 --> 00:27:38,890
Ah, sorry.

840
00:27:39,880 --> 00:27:44,460
What will it be? What will it be? What will it be?

841
00:27:46,850 --> 00:27:47,200
What is it?

842
00:27:48,420 --> 00:27:48,870
Wig.

843
00:27:49,220 --> 00:27:50,180
Talking about wigs!

844
00:27:50,180 --> 00:27:51,340
Talking about wigs?!

845
00:27:51,380 --> 00:27:51,950
- Wig Talk!
- Everyone's got this, right?

846
00:27:51,950 --> 00:27:53,270
- Everyone's got this, right?

847
00:27:53,310 --> 00:27:53,750
Right.

848
00:27:53,780 --> 00:27:54,300
Wig Talk...

849
00:27:54,300 --> 00:27:55,320
Talking about wigs?

850
00:27:55,630 --> 00:27:57,750
He's actually wearing a wig, right?

851
00:27:58,180 --> 00:27:58,570
Wig.

852
00:27:58,720 --> 00:28:02,700
Sumo wrestlers have to grow a Chonmage, right? (EN: 9)

853
00:28:02,700 --> 00:28:03,420
That's right.

854
00:28:03,900 --> 00:28:09,130
Actually people with thin hair do have to get hair implants for the hair bun.

855
00:28:09,850 --> 00:28:11,040
-Really?
-Is that so?

856
00:28:11,040 --> 00:28:11,990
That's right.

857
00:28:13,960 --> 00:28:18,740
But Sumo wrestlers wouldn't wear a wig, it would fall off too easily.

858
00:28:18,980 --> 00:28:20,150
You couldn't fight, right?

859
00:28:20,150 --> 00:28:20,980
That's right.

860
00:28:22,720 --> 00:28:23,180
I see.

861
00:28:24,890 --> 00:28:27,760
But the curves of your hair are so pretty.

862
00:28:28,190 --> 00:28:29,550
You know, I am a sculptor so I am familiar.

863
00:28:30,150 --> 00:28:32,280
But those curves are so amazing.

864
00:28:32,580 --> 00:28:33,480
This part.

865
00:28:34,300 --> 00:28:36,070
Like a slot canyon.

866
00:28:36,410 --> 00:28:36,980
-It's very pretty.
-Thank you.

867
00:28:37,130 --> 00:28:37,450
Alright...

868
00:28:40,240 --> 00:28:41,330
But it takes time, doesn't it?

869
00:28:42,510 --> 00:28:43,820
- I would say it takes me around 30 to 40 minutes.

870
00:28:43,820 --> 00:28:45,780
- Stop it with the hair talk!
- I would say it takes me around 30 to 40 minutes.

871
00:28:45,780 --> 00:28:47,000
- I would say it takes me around 30 to 40 minutes.

872
00:28:47,000 --> 00:28:48,610
- It takes that long?
- I would say it takes me around 30 to 40 minutes.

873
00:28:48,800 --> 00:28:50,240
That's right.

874
00:28:52,270 --> 00:28:54,700
Isn't it hard to sculpt that kind of hair?

875
00:28:54,700 --> 00:28:55,420
It really is.

876
00:28:55,780 --> 00:28:57,530
Especially since I mainly work on metal sculptures.

877
00:28:58,250 --> 00:29:00,190
It would be much easier if I worked with clay.

878
00:29:00,450 --> 00:29:03,960
But it's really hard with metal. You have to scrape and scratch the metal with the sander.

879
00:29:04,780 --> 00:29:05,320
It would be impossible.

880
00:29:05,420 --> 00:29:06,710
You'd never get something as beautiful.

881
00:29:07,310 --> 00:29:07,820
Thank you.

882
00:29:07,820 --> 00:29:09,080
Shingo, you also draw, don't you?

883
00:29:09,330 --> 00:29:10,720
-That's right.
-He's very good.

884
00:29:10,970 --> 00:29:12,480
I have been keeping up with your blog, Shingo.

885
00:29:13,030 --> 00:29:13,780
Thank you.

886
00:29:13,790 --> 00:29:14,520
It's very interesting.

887
00:29:14,650 --> 00:29:15,510
He's really amazing, you know?

888
00:29:15,510 --> 00:29:16,580
He could make a living with those drawings.

889
00:29:16,860 --> 00:29:17,180
Right?

890
00:29:17,260 --> 00:29:19,400
And those Arashi dolls of Ohno you made. (EN: 10)

891
00:29:19,590 --> 00:29:23,150
It was back when Ohno starred in Maou as a regular. (EN: 11)

892
00:29:23,510 --> 00:29:25,210
He apparently likes to go fishing.

893
00:29:25,470 --> 00:29:31,780
And after catching a 365 kg tuna, he made a sculpture with some fishing hooks.

894
00:29:32,010 --> 00:29:39,020
He was super happy about it.
And he came to me with a photograph of the sculpture the next day.

895
00:29:39,020 --> 00:29:40,010
He's making sure Musaka doesn't notice.
He was super happy about it.
And he came to me with a photograph of the sculpture the next day.

896
00:29:40,010 --> 00:29:41,280
He's making sure Musaka doesn't notice.

897
00:29:41,310 --> 00:29:41,780
Why?

898
00:29:41,790 --> 00:29:43,020
It was such amazing work by him.

899
00:29:43,780 --> 00:29:44,400
Amazing.

900
00:29:45,260 --> 00:29:46,460
That's amazing... You can even draw...

901
00:29:47,220 --> 00:29:49,010
Look at Kazunori.

902
00:29:49,010 --> 00:29:50,780
He's moving!

903
00:29:50,920 --> 00:29:51,350
He's moving.

904
00:29:51,360 --> 00:29:52,280
He's eating! Look!

905
00:29:52,610 --> 00:29:53,720
He's making sure Musaka doesn't notice.

906
00:29:53,990 --> 00:29:55,550
-But why?
-Why?!

907
00:29:55,970 --> 00:29:57,220
Why would he care if he sees?

908
00:29:57,720 --> 00:29:59,220
Thank you for that very special story.

909
00:29:59,570 --> 00:30:00,220
Thank you.

910
00:30:09,450 --> 00:30:09,950
What's wrong?

911
00:30:09,950 --> 00:30:11,250
What are they cooking now?

912
00:30:11,450 --> 00:30:12,820
This is such an amazing set, don't you think?

913
00:30:13,180 --> 00:30:14,620
-It really is.
-It's really cool!

914
00:30:14,620 --> 00:30:15,390
He forgot about the mayonnaise.

915
00:30:15,390 --> 00:30:16,320
All those years I have been watching this show.
He forgot about the mayonnaise.

916
00:30:16,320 --> 00:30:16,750
All those years I have been watching this show.

917
00:30:17,050 --> 00:30:18,300
And I finally got to set foot in this place.

918
00:30:18,320 --> 00:30:18,810
True!

919
00:30:19,080 --> 00:30:21,580
It has left a deep impression on me.

920
00:30:22,570 --> 00:30:24,420
We still have a ton of time.

921
00:30:25,620 --> 00:30:27,590
We're about to hit the 1-hour mark.

922
00:30:28,330 --> 00:30:30,900
-Not even...
-Right, we're about to hit it.

923
00:30:30,950 --> 00:30:31,650
That's right.

924
00:30:32,490 --> 00:30:35,720
-How long have you been making sculptures?
-Sculptures?

925
00:30:36,240 --> 00:30:36,980
-He's asking about sculpting again?

926
00:30:36,980 --> 00:30:38,630
- Well I'm 68 right now so...
-He's asking about sculpting again?

927
00:30:38,630 --> 00:30:38,710
-He's asking about sculpting again?

928
00:30:39,280 --> 00:30:41,540
And I started when I was 18...

929
00:30:41,650 --> 00:30:42,880
It's been that long?

930
00:30:42,880 --> 00:30:43,220
That's right.
It's been that long?

931
00:30:43,220 --> 00:30:43,750
That's right.

932
00:30:44,210 --> 00:30:45,380
After that...

933
00:30:45,650 --> 00:30:47,510
-What's this? A horse? It startled me...
-Me too.

934
00:30:55,600 --> 00:30:56,820
What's up? What's this?

935
00:30:58,620 --> 00:30:59,390
He's out of breath?

936
00:31:00,640 --> 00:31:01,720
Watch out, he's out of air?

937
00:31:05,520 --> 00:31:06,250
Thank you...

938
00:31:08,670 --> 00:31:09,420
Thank you...

939
00:31:15,880 --> 00:31:16,940
What's with that mustache?

940
00:31:16,940 --> 00:31:17,650
Are you alright?
What's with that mustache?

941
00:31:17,650 --> 00:31:18,090
What's with that mustache?

942
00:31:18,800 --> 00:31:19,300
Katsunori!

943
00:31:19,300 --> 00:31:20,970
That mustache was something else!

944
00:31:20,970 --> 00:31:23,150
You can't be drawing that kind of mustache!

945
00:31:23,160 --> 00:31:24,500
I mean, we'd never do something like that.

946
00:31:24,620 --> 00:31:27,450
-Us comedians would never draw a mustache like that, right.
-Right, we'd never.

947
00:31:27,480 --> 00:31:29,220
That's something you should never draw.

948
00:31:29,620 --> 00:31:31,250
That nose hair was super long, huh?

949
00:31:32,870 --> 00:31:33,280
The one?

950
00:31:34,310 --> 00:31:35,150
It went round and round.

951
00:31:35,180 --> 00:31:35,950
It wasn't a mustache?

952
00:31:36,820 --> 00:31:38,520
Was that a nose hair?

953
00:31:38,570 --> 00:31:39,350
It wasn't a mustache.

954
00:31:39,890 --> 00:31:40,350
A nose hair?

955
00:31:41,670 --> 00:31:42,970
A mustache? I don't think so.

956
00:31:43,470 --> 00:31:44,150
It was a nose hair.

957
00:31:44,160 --> 00:31:44,860
Nose hair, huh?

958
00:31:44,880 --> 00:31:45,500
Nose hair?

959
00:31:45,810 --> 00:31:47,890
I mean, it doesn't really matter...

960
00:31:48,680 --> 00:31:50,350
Did Katsu disappear again?

961
00:31:51,000 --> 00:31:51,520
Where's he?

962
00:31:52,580 --> 00:31:53,080
He's back.

963
00:31:53,750 --> 00:31:54,900
-Oh, he's back.
-What's this?

964
00:31:55,070 --> 00:31:55,700
He's here.

965
00:31:55,980 --> 00:31:56,450
A rabbit.

966
00:31:56,460 --> 00:31:57,180
Rabbit is here.

967
00:31:57,200 --> 00:31:57,660
It's the animal series.

968
00:31:57,660 --> 00:31:58,500
What is that?
It's the animal series.

969
00:31:58,500 --> 00:31:58,800
What is that?

970
00:31:59,030 --> 00:31:59,680
Hold on.

971
00:32:01,740 --> 00:32:02,830
They're ignoring him.

972
00:32:04,710 --> 00:32:06,720
-Is that a rabbit?
-It is, it's a rabbit.

973
00:32:07,450 --> 00:32:08,340
-Here it comes.
-Huh?

974
00:32:09,680 --> 00:32:10,500
Mayo!

975
00:32:23,190 --> 00:32:23,850
What was that?

976
00:32:26,780 --> 00:32:27,580
Out of air?

977
00:32:28,500 --> 00:32:29,950
Oh, he's out of air!

978
00:32:32,750 --> 00:32:33,220
Thank you.

979
00:32:35,900 --> 00:32:36,750
I'm truly thankful.

980
00:32:39,320 --> 00:32:40,020
Thank you.

981
00:32:49,470 --> 00:32:50,180
There's a smile!

982
00:32:51,010 --> 00:32:51,780
Alright!

983
00:32:53,040 --> 00:32:54,920
He smiled!

984
00:32:55,350 --> 00:32:57,520
He laughed at his own joke!

985
00:32:57,830 --> 00:32:59,280
He did, right?

986
00:32:59,590 --> 00:33:00,580
Was it Katsu?

987
00:33:00,880 --> 00:33:03,020
-Right.
-Katsu was the one that smiled, right?
-Yes.

988
00:33:03,250 --> 00:33:05,360
He laughed at his own joke.

989
00:33:06,080 --> 00:33:06,220
That always happens.

990
00:33:06,220 --> 00:33:06,970
He must have cracked up at Oyakata's indifference.
That always happens.

991
00:33:06,970 --> 00:33:08,220
He must have cracked up at Oyakata's indifference.

992
00:33:08,220 --> 00:33:09,780
And he was the one on the offensive!

993
00:33:14,020 --> 00:33:15,740
But no one's laughing!

994
00:33:15,740 --> 00:33:17,780
You guys are amazing!

995
00:33:17,790 --> 00:33:18,490
We're holding strong!

996
00:33:18,500 --> 00:33:19,790
You're not cracking!

997
00:33:19,820 --> 00:33:21,470
Even though there were a lot of funny skits!

998
00:33:21,510 --> 00:33:26,470
But sometimes the attacker ends up being the real victim.

999
00:33:27,950 --> 00:33:30,680
-So I have to issue you a card, Takahashi.
-Right, understood.

1000
00:33:31,000 --> 00:33:31,750
Was he laughing?

1001
00:33:32,100 --> 00:33:32,980
He sneakily laughed.

1002
00:33:32,980 --> 00:33:33,360
I was actually itchy around here.
He sneakily laughed.

1003
00:33:33,360 --> 00:33:34,790
I was actually itchy around here.

1004
00:33:35,490 --> 00:33:35,980
It was itchy.

1005
00:33:35,980 --> 00:33:36,450
Oh, are you telling me you weren't laughing?
It was itchy.

1006
00:33:36,450 --> 00:33:38,000
Oh, are you telling me you weren't laughing?

1007
00:33:38,000 --> 00:33:39,650
That's right.
I really didn't find it funny at all.

1008
00:33:39,660 --> 00:33:40,120
Is that so?

1009
00:33:40,130 --> 00:33:41,820
Let's have a look.

1010
00:33:44,460 --> 00:33:45,280
I'm truly thankful.

1011
00:33:45,440 --> 00:33:46,180
That's right.

1012
00:33:47,100 --> 00:33:48,120
This exchange between you two was very good.

1013
00:33:48,120 --> 00:33:48,750
Thank you.
This exchange between you two was very good.

1014
00:33:48,750 --> 00:33:50,420
This exchange between you two was very good.

1015
00:33:53,920 --> 00:33:55,920
You rarely get to see this stuff.

1016
00:34:01,070 --> 00:34:03,090
You were totally laughing!

1017
00:34:03,970 --> 00:34:05,030
You had the biggest smile on your face!

1018
00:34:05,030 --> 00:34:05,430
He really did!
You had the biggest smile on your face!

1019
00:34:05,430 --> 00:34:06,170
He really did!

1020
00:34:06,180 --> 00:34:08,850
That hug and kiss must have triggered it.

1021
00:34:08,860 --> 00:34:09,410
That's right.

1022
00:34:09,460 --> 00:34:09,680
Yeah.

1023
00:34:09,850 --> 00:34:11,550
But you can't be smiling like that.

1024
00:34:11,640 --> 00:34:12,280
Right.

1025
00:34:12,560 --> 00:34:13,320
That's the show.

1026
00:34:13,440 --> 00:34:14,320
Alright, got it.

1027
00:34:16,320 --> 00:34:20,020
But I would like to praise his proactivity.

1028
00:34:20,880 --> 00:34:21,980
I think it's really good.

1029
00:34:22,080 --> 00:34:24,050
I would like you guys to follow his lead.

1030
00:34:24,820 --> 00:34:25,480
Alright then.

1031
00:34:26,150 --> 00:34:26,650
Okay!

1032
00:34:26,790 --> 00:34:28,460
-We'll do our best!
-We will!

1033
00:34:30,720 --> 00:34:35,020
But you guys have very good defenses!

1034
00:34:35,880 --> 00:34:36,390
Alright!

1035
00:34:36,440 --> 00:34:37,450
No one's laughing!

1036
00:34:37,700 --> 00:34:38,550
Is this yours, Musaka?

1037
00:34:38,560 --> 00:34:39,020
Yes.

1038
00:34:39,930 --> 00:34:40,380
Alright.

1039
00:34:40,600 --> 00:34:42,670
Shingo...

1040
00:34:43,220 --> 00:34:43,450
Yes?

1041
00:34:43,730 --> 00:34:47,350
I'm actually making some new promotional photographs.

1042
00:34:47,880 --> 00:34:50,020
So I would like to get your opinions.

1043
00:34:50,740 --> 00:34:51,780
What about this one?

1044
00:34:53,740 --> 00:34:54,080
Look.

1045
00:34:54,400 --> 00:34:54,850
Hold on...

1046
00:34:55,750 --> 00:34:56,350
I mean...

1047
00:34:56,480 --> 00:34:59,480
I don't look that different, do I?

1048
00:34:59,510 --> 00:35:00,180
I mean...

1049
00:35:00,370 --> 00:35:00,880
Sorry.

1050
00:35:01,720 --> 00:35:02,120
This one.

1051
00:35:02,580 --> 00:35:03,150
Well...

1052
00:35:03,460 --> 00:35:04,510
Oyakata, what do you think?

1053
00:35:06,740 --> 00:35:07,740
I look the same, right?

1054
00:35:07,800 --> 00:35:09,380
I kinda look like Etsushi Toyokawa, no? (EN: 12)

1055
00:35:09,580 --> 00:35:11,340
Your hair is totally different though...

1056
00:35:11,380 --> 00:35:11,900
Really?

1057
00:35:12,340 --> 00:35:14,200
What about this one?
This is the second one.

1058
00:35:14,420 --> 00:35:14,580
Huh?

1059
00:35:14,910 --> 00:35:15,440
This one.

1060
00:35:15,450 --> 00:35:15,950
Look.

1061
00:35:17,580 --> 00:35:18,450
Isn't this one great?

1062
00:35:19,430 --> 00:35:21,480
I don't look that different in this one either, right?

1063
00:35:21,490 --> 00:35:22,300
You look quite cute here.

1064
00:35:22,310 --> 00:35:23,000
But the eyes...

1065
00:35:23,030 --> 00:35:24,280
The eyes look fake.

1066
00:35:24,310 --> 00:35:24,750
Really?

1067
00:35:25,520 --> 00:35:26,250
You really think so?

1068
00:35:26,430 --> 00:35:27,600
It's good, no?

1069
00:35:27,640 --> 00:35:28,980
It feels much brighter.

1070
00:35:29,610 --> 00:35:30,650
What about this one?

1071
00:35:31,250 --> 00:35:31,680
Have a look.

1072
00:35:32,060 --> 00:35:32,620
I mean...

1073
00:35:33,320 --> 00:35:33,850
Who?

1074
00:35:34,730 --> 00:35:36,780
I tried a bit of photoshop, is it not good?

1075
00:35:38,600 --> 00:35:39,650
I mean, it's cute...

1076
00:35:39,660 --> 00:35:41,340
-It's kinda cute.
-It is.
-It's like a different person.

1077
00:35:41,900 --> 00:35:49,740
Actually... Recently people have been telling me I look a lot like my father when he was young.

1078
00:35:49,890 --> 00:35:50,560
You really do.

1079
00:35:50,680 --> 00:35:52,300
Everyone's been saying that to me.

1080
00:35:52,300 --> 00:35:52,400
And your voice is really similar too.

1081
00:35:52,400 --> 00:35:53,640
Recently?
And your voice is really similar too.

1082
00:35:53,650 --> 00:35:55,180
Yes, just the other day.

1083
00:35:55,290 --> 00:36:02,990
They actually mentioned my father's promotional photographs and how much I resemble him.

1084
00:36:02,990 --> 00:36:04,480
So I brought some with me today.

1085
00:36:04,590 --> 00:36:05,150
Whoa!

1086
00:36:05,530 --> 00:36:07,280
Well, they are father and son.

1087
00:36:07,480 --> 00:36:09,180
Is he planning something?

1088
00:36:09,550 --> 00:36:10,640
Like this one.

1089
00:36:10,660 --> 00:36:11,060
Let's see.

1090
00:36:11,950 --> 00:36:13,790
Oh, this brings me back!

1091
00:36:14,550 --> 00:36:15,500
Do I really look like him?

1092
00:36:15,510 --> 00:36:16,080
How about this?

1093
00:36:16,140 --> 00:36:17,050
He's holding a mic in this one.

1094
00:36:17,050 --> 00:36:17,500
"Even at my age, I still have an insatiable libido..."
He's holding a mic in this one.

1095
00:36:17,500 --> 00:36:17,830
"Even at my age, I still have an insatiable libido..."

1096
00:36:17,830 --> 00:36:19,080
"Mama, can I eat this?"
"Even at my age, I still have an insatiable libido..."

1097
00:36:19,080 --> 00:36:19,600
"Mama, can I eat this?"

1098
00:36:21,380 --> 00:36:23,430
I must be the same age as him in these pictures.

1099
00:36:23,880 --> 00:36:26,580
"Now, I will ask all of you to kill each other"

1100
00:36:27,300 --> 00:36:28,180
Right...

1101
00:36:29,000 --> 00:36:30,710
He's younger than me here.

1102
00:36:31,820 --> 00:36:36,520
"I'm Mori... I smell shit on my hand even though I haven't touched any"

1103
00:36:37,380 --> 00:36:38,380
Does he really say this stuff?

1104
00:36:39,450 --> 00:36:42,100
I've been told I look most similar to my dad from this angle.

1105
00:36:43,180 --> 00:36:44,640
"Can I put my underwear back on?"

1106
00:36:44,650 --> 00:36:45,950
Does your father really say this stuff?

1107
00:36:46,050 --> 00:36:47,050
He ain't wearing any?!

1108
00:36:48,260 --> 00:36:49,320
"Shut up, middle-school graduate"

1109
00:36:49,390 --> 00:36:49,750
Rude!

1110
00:36:50,220 --> 00:36:50,880
So rude!

1111
00:36:51,000 --> 00:36:51,950
Does he really say that stuff?

1112
00:36:52,950 --> 00:36:56,430
I mean, he was a pretty strict father...

1113
00:36:56,450 --> 00:36:57,120
That's right...

1114
00:36:57,130 --> 00:36:58,950
-What does "Give me an L of this" mean?
-Huh?

1115
00:37:00,590 --> 00:37:01,590
"Give me an L of this"?

1116
00:37:01,640 --> 00:37:02,720
Katori is in trouble.

1117
00:37:03,980 --> 00:37:04,520
"We chose this place cause you said you wanted to eat Katsu-don"

1118
00:37:04,520 --> 00:37:06,880
Do I really look like him?
"We chose this place cause you said you wanted to eat Katsu-don"

1119
00:37:06,880 --> 00:37:07,500
"We chose this place cause you said you wanted to eat Katsu-don"

1120
00:37:09,130 --> 00:37:10,320
His face hasn't changed much since then.

1121
00:37:10,890 --> 00:37:12,820
He doesn't say this stuff, does he?

1122
00:37:13,010 --> 00:37:15,990
Well, he was a pretty strict father...

1123
00:37:16,010 --> 00:37:18,580
I think I look a lot like him in this picture.

1124
00:37:19,300 --> 00:37:20,350
But he doesn't say any of this stuff, does he?

1125
00:37:20,870 --> 00:37:21,360
He does.

1126
00:37:21,360 --> 00:37:21,420
"Insatiable libido"?
He does.

1127
00:37:21,420 --> 00:37:23,220
"Insatiable libido"?

1128
00:37:23,400 --> 00:37:25,620
Well...

1129
00:37:25,620 --> 00:37:27,480
Back then he...

1130
00:37:29,420 --> 00:37:30,550
It was a different time, you know?

1131
00:37:30,610 --> 00:37:31,550
"Mama, can I eat this?"

1132
00:37:32,980 --> 00:37:33,920
It's Mori.

1133
00:37:34,380 --> 00:37:35,500
He must be saying that to his wife.

1134
00:37:35,500 --> 00:37:37,100
In which of these do I look most like him?

1135
00:37:37,390 --> 00:37:38,500
I think it's gotta be this one.

1136
00:37:38,530 --> 00:37:39,150
This one.

1137
00:37:39,160 --> 00:37:39,990
Oh, you're right.

1138
00:37:40,000 --> 00:37:41,820
Oyakata, try reading this one out loud.

1139
00:37:42,010 --> 00:37:42,880
Please go ahead.

1140
00:37:43,250 --> 00:37:47,710
"Now, I will ask all of you to kill each other"

1141
00:37:51,950 --> 00:37:53,650
Sho is in trouble!

1142
00:37:54,090 --> 00:37:54,480
He ran away!

1143
00:37:55,700 --> 00:37:58,380
That was such a great move by him!

1144
00:37:58,790 --> 00:37:59,620
Let's read some more.

1145
00:37:59,820 --> 00:38:02,020
-Katori and Sho were about to crack.
-Right.

1146
00:38:02,020 --> 00:38:03,050
"Even at my age, I still have an insatiable libido..."
-Katori and Sho were about to crack.
-Right.

1147
00:38:03,050 --> 00:38:04,920
"Even at my age, I still have an insatiable libido..."

1148
00:38:07,430 --> 00:38:08,780
Sorry Oyakata, could you...?

1149
00:38:09,490 --> 00:38:13,980
-Could you put a bit more emotion into your delivery?
-Sure.

1150
00:38:14,570 --> 00:38:16,980
-"Can I put my underwear back on?"
-Everyone's about to crack.

1151
00:38:19,720 --> 00:38:20,780
That was pretty good.

1152
00:38:20,830 --> 00:38:22,730
He talks a bit more loudly.

1153
00:38:22,860 --> 00:38:24,380
But they're doing well.

1154
00:38:25,320 --> 00:38:26,850
"Shut up, middle-school graduate"

1155
00:38:29,710 --> 00:38:31,370
Having Oyakata read this was such a great idea.

1156
00:38:31,370 --> 00:38:32,150
It really was.

1157
00:38:32,200 --> 00:38:33,140
They found a use for him.

1158
00:38:33,140 --> 00:38:33,830
Your father is a genius.
They found a use for him.

1159
00:38:33,830 --> 00:38:35,350
Your father is a genius.

1160
00:38:36,130 --> 00:38:40,120
"Now, I will ask all of you to kill each other"

1161
00:38:42,290 --> 00:38:42,680
Scary!

1162
00:38:43,220 --> 00:38:44,000
That's such a scary line!

1163
00:38:45,470 --> 00:38:46,970
I brought the sampler.

1164
00:38:46,970 --> 00:38:47,720
I see.

1165
00:38:47,980 --> 00:38:48,480
What's this?

1166
00:38:48,710 --> 00:38:49,620
You can make some sound effects with this.

1167
00:38:50,180 --> 00:38:50,620
Whoa!

1168
00:38:52,080 --> 00:38:56,380
-Can we try again? But now we'll use the sampler.
-Oh, I see!

1169
00:38:58,350 --> 00:39:00,220
Hearing this from Mori himself would be scary!

1170
00:39:02,410 --> 00:39:05,800
"Mama, can I eat this?"

1171
00:39:09,000 --> 00:39:10,580
-Not like that.
-That's not quite right.

1172
00:39:10,670 --> 00:39:11,550
-It's wrong.
-Not like that.

1173
00:39:12,050 --> 00:39:13,190
What about this one?

1174
00:39:13,380 --> 00:39:13,780
Sure.

1175
00:39:14,880 --> 00:39:15,380
Here I go.

1176
00:39:17,780 --> 00:39:23,550
"I'm Mori... I smell shit on my hand even though I haven't touched any"

1177
00:39:26,580 --> 00:39:28,800
That was so close. He was super close!

1178
00:39:28,800 --> 00:39:29,280
His voice is a bit similar.

1179
00:39:29,280 --> 00:39:29,800
-His voice is identical!
-Yeah, it's a bit similar.
His voice is a bit similar.

1180
00:39:29,800 --> 00:39:31,130
-His voice is identical!
-Yeah, it's a bit similar.

1181
00:39:31,160 --> 00:39:32,890
You really sound like him.

1182
00:39:33,450 --> 00:39:34,580
You sound like Mori.

1183
00:39:35,170 --> 00:39:36,580
-To his dad.
-That's right.

1184
00:39:36,590 --> 00:39:37,640
You felt your dad's spirit in his delivery, didn't you?

1185
00:39:37,640 --> 00:39:38,300
I really did!
You felt your dad's spirit in his delivery, didn't you?

1186
00:39:38,300 --> 00:39:38,420
I really did!

1187
00:39:38,550 --> 00:39:40,180
I really felt it when he said: "I'm Mori".

1188
00:39:40,260 --> 00:39:43,900
- How about we have him act out Mori a bit more.

1189
00:39:43,900 --> 00:39:45,550
-Right.
-We should.
- How about we have him act out Mori a bit more.

1190
00:39:45,550 --> 00:39:45,610
- How about we have him act out Mori a bit more.

1191
00:39:46,720 --> 00:39:49,350
We need a bit more emotion.

1192
00:39:49,420 --> 00:39:50,650
You have to become Shinichi Mori.

1193
00:39:50,660 --> 00:39:53,950
We need a huskier voice. A much more loose delivery.

1194
00:40:00,280 --> 00:40:00,750
Here it goes.

1195
00:40:09,130 --> 00:40:10,350
Alright.

1196
00:40:11,610 --> 00:40:12,680
"Totoro was really there!" (EN: 13)

1197
00:40:12,700 --> 00:40:14,040
Hold on, I haven't played the 'ta-da' effect yet.

1198
00:40:14,060 --> 00:40:15,130
Wait for the sound to play.

1199
00:40:15,130 --> 00:40:16,040
Say it after the sound, okay?

1200
00:40:16,120 --> 00:40:18,350
You have to wait for the sound.

1201
00:40:18,350 --> 00:40:19,520
He's gotta imitate his voice.

1202
00:40:21,550 --> 00:40:22,540
Katori is in such trouble.

1203
00:40:22,540 --> 00:40:22,920
Oyakata chose another one.
Katori is in such trouble.

1204
00:40:22,920 --> 00:40:23,930
Oyakata chose another one.

1205
00:40:23,930 --> 00:40:24,850
Which one?

1206
00:40:26,990 --> 00:40:28,350
You have to turn into Shinichi Mori.

1207
00:40:28,360 --> 00:40:28,750
Alright!

1208
00:40:29,780 --> 00:40:30,280
Go ahead.

1209
00:40:30,280 --> 00:40:31,150
This is so rare.

1210
00:40:31,270 --> 00:40:32,420
Everyone's loitering.

1211
00:40:32,460 --> 00:40:33,750
They don't know what he's about to read.

1212
00:40:33,790 --> 00:40:33,980
Alright.

1213
00:40:34,220 --> 00:40:34,870
Everyone's about to crack.

1214
00:40:34,880 --> 00:40:36,380
- He's shuffling them.
- Oh, he's shuffling them!

1215
00:40:36,820 --> 00:40:37,680
Please give me the cue.

1216
00:40:37,740 --> 00:40:39,150
-Please give him the cue.
-The cue, please.

1217
00:40:39,610 --> 00:40:40,530
Alright, here it goes.

1218
00:40:44,120 --> 00:40:45,250
"Totoro was really there!"

1219
00:40:48,940 --> 00:40:51,350
I feel like you forgot about Shinichi Mori just now.

1220
00:40:52,420 --> 00:40:52,750
Right?

1221
00:40:52,760 --> 00:40:53,610
It was just the usual Oyakata.

1222
00:40:53,620 --> 00:40:53,970
"Totoro..."

1223
00:40:53,980 --> 00:40:55,830
- You turned back to your usual self.
- You want me to imitate Mori?

1224
00:40:55,900 --> 00:40:56,450
Yes, yes.

1225
00:40:58,970 --> 00:41:04,600
"Now, I will ask all of you to kill each other"

1226
00:41:04,870 --> 00:41:06,680
- That's the same!
- It's the same!

1227
00:41:06,710 --> 00:41:07,880
You have to act it out!

1228
00:41:07,930 --> 00:41:09,620
"Go home, take a shit and go to bed!"

1229
00:41:12,340 --> 00:41:17,320
"We chose this place cause you said you wanted to eat Katsu-don"

1230
00:41:21,950 --> 00:41:23,620
"Now, I will ask all of you to kill each other"

1231
00:41:23,620 --> 00:41:24,050
Again?
"Now, I will ask all of you to kill each other"

1232
00:41:24,050 --> 00:41:27,940
"Now, I will ask all of you to kill each other"

1233
00:41:32,160 --> 00:41:34,180
They are really good!

1234
00:41:38,900 --> 00:41:40,320
Could I have the Totoro one?

1235
00:41:40,400 --> 00:41:41,280
The one with the Totoro quote.

1236
00:41:45,010 --> 00:41:47,710
"Mama, can I eat this?"

1237
00:41:51,600 --> 00:41:53,430
I can't let it keep going!

1238
00:41:53,530 --> 00:41:54,620
Right!

1239
00:41:54,900 --> 00:41:55,620
It's too much.

1240
00:41:56,820 --> 00:41:58,020
Totally!

1241
00:41:58,150 --> 00:41:59,960
-It's been going for a while now.
-Yeah.

1242
00:42:00,150 --> 00:42:01,150
He's been doing it this whole time.

1243
00:42:01,160 --> 00:42:02,400
He's been grinning all this time.

1244
00:42:02,620 --> 00:42:03,350
I didn't laugh.

1245
00:42:04,030 --> 00:42:05,150
I was on the edge the whole time.

1246
00:42:05,160 --> 00:42:06,360
Who was it?
I didn't laugh.

1247
00:42:06,690 --> 00:42:07,980
He must know already.

1248
00:42:08,960 --> 00:42:12,590
All of you were about to crack so you started loitering, didn't you?

1249
00:42:12,740 --> 00:42:13,680
Loitering?!

1250
00:42:14,180 --> 00:42:15,350
We really did!

1251
00:42:15,350 --> 00:42:15,680
Everyone was just walking around in a circle.
We really did!

1252
00:42:15,680 --> 00:42:19,640
Everyone was just walking around in a circle.

1253
00:42:20,500 --> 00:42:22,460
And the incident didn't happen in a single moment.

1254
00:42:22,460 --> 00:42:24,850
I will now take out a card.

1255
00:42:26,110 --> 00:42:26,920
It's a yellow card.

1256
00:42:28,570 --> 00:42:29,050
For Katori.

1257
00:42:30,380 --> 00:42:31,050
Shingo?

1258
00:42:31,170 --> 00:42:32,170
You had it coming.

1259
00:42:32,510 --> 00:42:35,060
The crafty schemer drowned in his own scheme.

1260
00:42:43,870 --> 00:42:46,580
"Mama, can I eat this?"

1261
00:42:50,420 --> 00:42:52,330
I can't let it keep going!

1262
00:42:52,420 --> 00:42:55,750
I was the one who suggested Oyakata read this.

1263
00:42:57,350 --> 00:43:00,680
-But using Oyakata like that was a stroke of genius.
-It was the best!

1264
00:43:01,220 --> 00:43:03,170
And this will also help Oyakata in the future.

1265
00:43:03,650 --> 00:43:04,270
I see!

1266
00:43:04,280 --> 00:43:05,340
Alright, let's keep going.

1267
00:43:05,340 --> 00:43:05,580
-Yes!
-Yes!
Alright, let's keep going.

1268
00:43:05,580 --> 00:43:06,020
-Yes!
-Yes!

1269
00:43:06,780 --> 00:43:07,520
What about that?

1270
00:43:13,850 --> 00:43:15,420
Ouch!!

1271
00:43:18,260 --> 00:43:19,620
That's right.

1272
00:43:20,750 --> 00:43:22,550
That's Gushiken!
