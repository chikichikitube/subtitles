00:00:23,400 --> 00:00:25,240
Misaki

2
00:00:26,670 --> 00:00:27,990
Hello?

3
00:00:28,650 --> 00:00:32,840
Go to the cleaners and get my blouse.

4
00:00:33,860 --> 00:00:35,060
Right now?

5
00:00:35,850 --> 00:00:38,310
You'll make it if you run.

6
00:00:54,800 --> 00:00:57,870
Cleaning
White Express

7
00:01:23,950 --> 00:01:25,300
Did you get it?

8
00:01:26,180 --> 00:01:29,670
I ran as fast as I could...

9
00:01:29,670 --> 00:01:31,380
but they had just closed the shutter...

10
00:01:32,430 --> 00:01:36,430
What am I supposed to wear
to tomorrow's dinner party?

11
00:01:34,730 --> 00:01:38,240
I-I understand, I'll get it
first thing in the morning!

12
00:01:38,240 --> 00:01:39,710
You're useless!

13
00:01:44,750 --> 00:01:47,470
The dishes are piled up.

14
00:02:31,440 --> 00:02:34,860
Hey Kanae-chan, are you
getting used to working here?

15
00:02:32,890 --> 00:02:34,790
Office landlord:
Toyama Yoshie

16
00:02:34,860 --> 00:02:37,190
Not at all, yet.

17
00:02:37,190 --> 00:02:39,470
But I'm getting used to killing time.

18
00:02:37,260 --> 00:02:39,470
Hakamada's assistant:
Nonomura Kanae

19
00:02:39,470 --> 00:02:42,160
There's no work to do at all.

20
00:02:39,800 --> 00:02:42,540
Temp:
Shinozuka Rina

21
00:02:42,160 --> 00:02:44,290
There's no appointments
today, either.

22
00:02:49,850 --> 00:02:51,740
Hurry up and play your card.

23
00:02:52,000 --> 00:02:53,700
There, I won.

24
00:02:54,900 --> 00:02:56,510
I didn't hear you say "Uno!"

25
00:02:56,510 --> 00:02:57,650
I said it.

26
00:02:57,650 --> 00:02:59,040
Liar!

27
00:02:57,780 --> 00:03:01,190
The current episode's client:
Ichikawa Tomohiro

28
00:02:59,040 --> 00:02:59,890
I said it!

29
00:02:59,890 --> 00:03:02,020
And I won fair and square.

30
00:03:02,020 --> 00:03:04,020
You're on a winning streak.

31
00:03:07,830 --> 00:03:11,530
Um... this is a law office, right?

32
00:03:11,930 --> 00:03:13,650
A client?

33
00:03:13,970 --> 00:03:15,860
Are you a client?

34
00:03:16,340 --> 00:03:18,590
We've been waiting for you.

35
00:03:18,590 --> 00:03:20,070
Let me get your coat for you.

36
00:03:21,610 --> 00:03:24,200
Please, please, please. This way.

37
00:03:24,200 --> 00:03:27,000
Sit. Sit.

38
00:03:27,000 --> 00:03:28,980
My goodness.

39
00:03:28,980 --> 00:03:31,100
We haven't had a male client in so long.

40
00:03:32,390 --> 00:03:34,540
Is it adultery? Did she cheat on you?

41
00:03:34,540 --> 00:03:36,060
No, I...

42
00:03:36,060 --> 00:03:38,170
Sensei, are you ready?

43
00:03:38,170 --> 00:03:39,140
Yes...

44
00:03:40,390 --> 00:03:42,300
Thank you for waiting.

45
00:03:42,910 --> 00:03:47,330
I am the attorney, Hakamada.

46
00:03:44,460 --> 00:03:47,330
Attorney:
Hakamada Yukio

47
00:03:52,100 --> 00:03:54,370
Sensei, what are you doing? Get tea!

48
00:03:54,370 --> 00:03:56,150
Ah, yes.

49
00:03:58,410 --> 00:04:00,540
I think I'd better go somewhere elseー

50
00:04:02,530 --> 00:04:06,830
There, just relax.

51
00:04:06,830 --> 00:04:09,010
I have work to doー

52
00:04:07,720 --> 00:04:09,550
Please sit down.

53
00:04:10,850 --> 00:04:13,820
I slept well.

54
00:04:14,800 --> 00:04:16,460
I see.

55
00:04:16,460 --> 00:04:19,050
So you're being vexed by a monster wife.

56
00:04:19,050 --> 00:04:20,430
"Monster wife"?

57
00:04:20,430 --> 00:04:23,690
A monster wife. A wife who
changes after the wedding,

58
00:04:23,690 --> 00:04:26,800
and menaces the husband.

59
00:04:26,800 --> 00:04:30,110
Women are stronger than men nowadays.

60
00:04:30,110 --> 00:04:32,420
Compared to women, these men are...

61
00:04:39,060 --> 00:04:42,200
There are many kinds of monster wives.

62
00:04:42,520 --> 00:04:45,790
The visual type, mental type,
and sexual type.

63
00:04:45,790 --> 00:04:47,190
What type is she?

64
00:04:48,440 --> 00:04:49,820
I don't know...

65
00:04:51,550 --> 00:04:55,200
I'm a marketer for a software company.

66
00:04:55,920 --> 00:04:57,930
My wife is a homemaker.

67
00:04:58,370 --> 00:05:00,310
She rarely does anything at the house.

68
00:05:01,390 --> 00:05:05,480
But she has control over finances...

69
00:05:11,780 --> 00:05:15,220
Tomohiro's wife:
Ichikawa Misaki

70
00:05:13,280 --> 00:05:16,060
How long of a shower are you
gonna take? What a waste!

71
00:05:16,060 --> 00:05:18,760
Gas bills aren't cheap, you know?

72
00:05:18,760 --> 00:05:23,590
They cut your pay,
so think before you act.

73
00:05:23,590 --> 00:05:26,910
I'm cutting 5,000 yen from
your allowance starting this month.

74
00:05:26,910 --> 00:05:29,100
W-Wait!

75
00:05:30,260 --> 00:05:33,530
10,000 yen a month isn't enough...

76
00:05:33,530 --> 00:05:38,620
There's no space left for me at home...

77
00:05:40,520 --> 00:05:43,440
She buys nothing but brand-name items...

78
00:05:44,040 --> 00:05:46,280
She goes to spas that cost
hundreds of thousands...

79
00:05:47,050 --> 00:05:50,060
She goes out to lunches at first-rate hotels...

80
00:05:51,520 --> 00:05:54,760
I see... expenditures.

81
00:05:54,760 --> 00:05:56,040
What else?

82
00:05:58,150 --> 00:06:00,690
Is there any domestic violence?

83
00:06:01,870 --> 00:06:03,910
As soon as she loses her temper,
she resorts to violence.

84
00:06:03,910 --> 00:06:07,550
Recently she's learned a new technique:
the roundhouse kick.

85
00:06:11,970 --> 00:06:13,260
I understand.

86
00:06:13,260 --> 00:06:15,210
So, she's the violent-type monster.

87
00:06:15,210 --> 00:06:17,590
I'm at my wit's end.

88
00:06:17,590 --> 00:06:21,210
These days, when I get home from work,

89
00:06:21,210 --> 00:06:23,220
I get intensely anxious...

90
00:06:23,220 --> 00:06:25,170
I get frequent headaches...

91
00:06:26,870 --> 00:06:29,610
Say, never mind that.
What about adultery?

92
00:06:29,610 --> 00:06:31,220
Who's she cheating with?

93
00:06:31,860 --> 00:06:32,790
What?

94
00:06:32,790 --> 00:06:35,490
You know, your wife's lover.

95
00:06:36,410 --> 00:06:39,460
As far as I know, she hasn't been cheating.

96
00:06:39,460 --> 00:06:42,000
What? She hasn't?

97
00:06:42,510 --> 00:06:43,640
Yes.

98
00:06:43,640 --> 00:06:45,000
This is hopeless.

99
00:06:45,000 --> 00:06:46,620
You're right.

100
00:06:46,620 --> 00:06:47,500
Hopeless?

101
00:06:47,500 --> 00:06:49,380
Why is that?

102
00:06:49,380 --> 00:06:53,910
Divorces not based on adultery
can become prolonged.

103
00:06:53,910 --> 00:06:57,610
Plus, it's difficult for a husband
to get compensation from a wife.

104
00:06:57,610 --> 00:07:02,920
It is a fact that women have
an advantage in court.

105
00:07:02,920 --> 00:07:05,020
Is that so?

106
00:07:05,370 --> 00:07:07,420
This is quicksand. Quicksand.

107
00:07:07,420 --> 00:07:08,730
Sensei, drop him.

108
00:07:08,730 --> 00:07:12,740
He doesn't fit the bill, and who
knows if he can get compensated.

109
00:07:12,740 --> 00:07:13,930
No.

110
00:07:15,450 --> 00:07:16,800
We can get paid.

111
00:07:16,800 --> 00:07:18,840
Huh?

112
00:07:18,840 --> 00:07:24,750
Compensation in a lawsuit based on the infliction
of physical and psychological pain.

113
00:07:24,750 --> 00:07:30,110
Domestic violence, moral harassment,
neglect of household duties, expenditures...

114
00:07:30,110 --> 00:07:32,920
We have all the premises
for pursuing a divorce.

115
00:07:33,250 --> 00:07:37,720
Ichikawa-san, you truly
are in pain, correct?

116
00:07:37,720 --> 00:07:38,970
Yes.

117
00:07:38,970 --> 00:07:40,390
In that case,

118
00:07:41,550 --> 00:07:44,330
it is only proper that
we demand compensation.

Compensation...

122
00:07:59,550 --> 00:08:06,050
If you are ready to demand compensation,
then I will give you my full support.

123
00:08:08,250 --> 00:08:09,530
Hey, what the...

124
00:08:11,810 --> 00:08:14,730
Please help me.

125
00:08:15,330 --> 00:08:18,000
He accepted the client...

126
00:08:18,000 --> 00:08:20,180
I'm done here!

127
00:08:20,870 --> 00:08:24,270
Now that we've agreed,
let's take action.

128
00:08:25,640 --> 00:08:29,300
What would you want to tell
your wife the most right now?

129
00:08:33,110 --> 00:08:37,310
Close your eyes and
imagine your wife's face.

130
00:08:41,270 --> 00:08:44,790
I'm cutting 5,000 yen from
your allowance starting this month.

131
00:08:44,790 --> 00:08:46,650
The dishes are piled up.

132
00:08:47,400 --> 00:08:48,520
Now,

133
00:08:48,520 --> 00:08:50,790
what do you want to say to her?

134
00:08:53,690 --> 00:08:54,730
You're useless!

135
00:08:54,730 --> 00:08:57,930
Don't be ridiculous!
I'm doing the best I can!

136
00:08:57,930 --> 00:08:58,770
That's it!

137
00:08:58,770 --> 00:09:00,380
Let's go with that!

138
00:09:00,890 --> 00:09:04,730
Go and let your wife take those words.

139
00:09:04,730 --> 00:09:06,410
I can't!

140
00:09:06,410 --> 00:09:08,440
This is what you're missing.

143
00:09:10,910 --> 00:09:12,850
"Iron Spy Woman Marilyn"

144
00:09:12,390 --> 00:09:16,910
It depicts how Marilyn came
to possess a heart of iron.

145
00:09:27,750 --> 00:09:29,180
I'm not running anymore.

146
00:09:29,490 --> 00:09:31,710
I won't run away ever again.

147
00:09:34,350 --> 00:09:35,730
Sensei.

148
00:09:35,730 --> 00:09:39,320
What did you mean when you told him
to let his wife take those words?

149
00:09:40,600 --> 00:09:44,860
It will help him prepare
to fight his wife.

150
00:09:46,160 --> 00:09:47,180
And...

151
00:09:47,180 --> 00:09:48,670
And?

152
00:09:50,120 --> 00:09:51,790
You'll find out shortly.

153
00:09:53,250 --> 00:09:55,160
I'm not running anymore.

154
00:09:55,160 --> 00:09:57,470
I won't run away ever again.

155
00:09:57,470 --> 00:09:58,380
I'm not running anymore.

156
00:09:58,380 --> 00:10:00,360
I won't run away ever again.

157
00:10:00,360 --> 00:10:01,260
I'm not running anymore.

158
00:10:02,160 --> 00:10:04,400
I won't run away ever again.

159
00:10:20,790 --> 00:10:22,120
Don't be ridiculous...

160
00:10:25,650 --> 00:10:27,280
I'm...

161
00:10:30,710 --> 00:10:32,110
I'm...

162
00:10:33,140 --> 00:10:34,860
I'm...

163
00:10:34,860 --> 00:10:36,490
You're what?

164
00:10:36,930 --> 00:10:38,530
Say it.

165
00:10:39,400 --> 00:10:46,970
I'm... I'm... doing the best I can!

166
00:10:48,280 --> 00:10:50,140
It was amazing how attractive
she must have been...

167
00:10:50,140 --> 00:10:52,770
That's amazing!

168
00:10:58,280 --> 00:10:59,910
Ichikawa-san?

169
00:11:03,480 --> 00:11:05,860
I told her off.

170
00:11:05,860 --> 00:11:08,790
What an incredible monster.

171
00:11:08,790 --> 00:11:10,230
Beautiful.

172
00:11:10,980 --> 00:11:13,580
This is beautiful, Ichikawa-san.

173
00:11:14,460 --> 00:11:15,830
Congratulations.

00:11:27,440 --> 00:11:29,940
This, and this.

176
00:11:31,920 --> 00:11:35,500
You knew this would happen, didn't you?

177
00:11:37,430 --> 00:11:41,330
Anyway, now we have proof
of domestic violence.

178
00:11:43,930 --> 00:11:46,610
You've cleared the first hurdle.

179
00:11:46,890 --> 00:11:48,050
Congratulations!

180
00:11:48,050 --> 00:11:49,460
You did it.

181
00:11:49,840 --> 00:11:53,490
Let's move on to the second stage.

182
00:11:53,920 --> 00:11:54,580
What?

183
00:11:55,860 --> 00:11:57,570
There's more?

184
00:11:58,870 --> 00:12:00,800
When you battle a monster,

185
00:12:00,800 --> 00:12:04,480
you must attack its vital points.

186
00:12:04,480 --> 00:12:05,940
Vital points...

187
00:12:19,170 --> 00:12:23,430
You must thoroughly uncover
the facts of your wife's expenditures.

188
00:12:23,430 --> 00:12:25,720
Gather as much evidence as you can.

189
00:12:25,720 --> 00:12:30,070
Purchased items, receipts,
credit card statements...

190
00:12:30,070 --> 00:12:32,460
And savings account ledger
would be helpful, as well.

191
00:13:00,360 --> 00:13:01,640
What are you doing?

192
00:13:05,210 --> 00:13:09,510
I knocked it over by accident
so I'm cleaning it up.

193
00:13:14,420 --> 00:13:15,630
What is important here

194
00:13:15,630 --> 00:13:21,780
is establishing the ratio of your wife's
expenditures to your income.

195
00:13:21,780 --> 00:13:25,520
These things will be evidence
for the expenditures.

196
00:13:25,520 --> 00:13:28,470
Now to find the savings ledger...

197
00:14:28,080 --> 00:14:30,290
620,000 yen?

198
00:14:30,290 --> 00:14:31,780
That's all?

199
00:14:32,120 --> 00:14:35,230
At most, we had about
six million in there.

200
00:14:35,230 --> 00:14:36,950
Six million...

201
00:14:36,950 --> 00:14:40,520
So, she spent it all on this stuff?

202
00:14:40,520 --> 00:14:43,930
Look at all that stuff she bought.

203
00:14:43,930 --> 00:14:46,630
I had no idea we were so depleted.

204
00:14:46,630 --> 00:14:48,900
Could your wife have
another savings account?

205
00:14:48,900 --> 00:14:50,130
I don't think so.

206
00:14:50,130 --> 00:14:52,670
We've closed out our
certificates of deposit, too.

207
00:14:52,670 --> 00:14:54,410
What are you going to do, Sensei?

208
00:14:54,410 --> 00:14:57,040
You can't get any
compensation with this.

209
00:14:57,040 --> 00:15:00,420
That's why I warned you.

210
00:15:00,420 --> 00:15:05,290
If it's not possible, I can
forgo the compensation.

211
00:15:10,990 --> 00:15:14,740
I knew you were acting sneaky lately...

212
00:15:14,740 --> 00:15:16,220
and look what I've found...

213
00:15:19,760 --> 00:15:23,490
You got my ledger and are
talking to a lawyer?

214
00:15:23,490 --> 00:15:26,140
You trying to separate from me?

215
00:15:26,600 --> 00:15:27,620
A woman.

216
00:15:27,620 --> 00:15:29,360
You have a new woman, don't you?

217
00:15:29,360 --> 00:15:30,930
I'm right, aren't I?

218
00:15:30,930 --> 00:15:32,820
This is ridiculous.

219
00:15:32,820 --> 00:15:34,730
Who is the woman?

220
00:15:36,620 --> 00:15:38,750
Help me!

221
00:15:38,750 --> 00:15:43,190
Say it! Confess!

222
00:15:43,190 --> 00:15:45,160
I am not cheating!

223
00:15:45,160 --> 00:15:47,490
I can't breathe!

224
00:15:46,180 --> 00:15:47,490
Sensei.

225
00:15:50,430 --> 00:15:52,450
I know I might be
crossing a line, but...

226
00:15:55,880 --> 00:15:57,830
Your husband isn't cheating on you!

227
00:16:02,980 --> 00:16:06,410
You're the lawyer?

228
00:16:11,300 --> 00:16:14,780
Oh. The bread's ready.

229
00:16:21,570 --> 00:16:23,320
Have some if you'd like.

230
00:16:30,610 --> 00:16:33,070
I won't agree to a separation.

231
00:16:35,780 --> 00:16:39,120
But, if you insist we separate...

232
00:16:39,120 --> 00:16:42,010
I want ten million yen
in compensation.

233
00:16:42,330 --> 00:16:44,750
What a monster.

234
00:16:44,750 --> 00:16:48,030
What is the premise
for the compensation?

235
00:16:48,030 --> 00:16:49,250
Has your husband done something?

236
00:16:49,250 --> 00:16:51,710
Of course. Our marriage is sexless.

237
00:16:52,160 --> 00:16:55,260
None whatsoever, from a long time ago.

238
00:16:55,260 --> 00:16:58,360
This man is useless.

239
00:16:59,400 --> 00:17:03,260
Sensei. I have reason
for divorce, don't I?

240
00:17:04,760 --> 00:17:07,900
Yes. In the case a man is impotent...

241
00:17:07,900 --> 00:17:09,490
I'm not impotent!

242
00:17:10,600 --> 00:17:12,810
I can get it up for anyone but you.

243
00:17:17,870 --> 00:17:20,750
So, you are cheating on me.

244
00:17:22,920 --> 00:17:25,020
Confess! Right now!

245
00:17:24,750 --> 00:17:28,180
Madam, please calm down.

246
00:17:25,020 --> 00:17:29,230
Say it. Get it out. Say it!

247
00:17:29,230 --> 00:17:31,950
Please eat this and calm down.

248
00:17:34,230 --> 00:17:36,100
Disgusting.

249
00:17:36,100 --> 00:17:38,040
What the hell is this?

250
00:17:38,040 --> 00:17:42,400
Anyway, I'll never agree to a divorce.

251
00:17:56,290 --> 00:17:58,240
You, hold on a second!

252
00:17:58,240 --> 00:17:59,540
Shut up!

253
00:18:09,570 --> 00:18:13,450
She said my bagel is disgusting...

254
00:18:15,240 --> 00:18:16,700
Unforgivable.

255
00:18:18,530 --> 00:18:21,100
Ichikawa-san. I will
assuredly get you a divorce,

256
00:18:22,160 --> 00:18:24,340
and compensation, too!

257
00:18:25,280 --> 00:18:27,370
Looks like she pressed the right button.

258
00:18:27,370 --> 00:18:29,080
He's just bitter.

259
00:18:29,080 --> 00:18:32,450
What the hell just came
dashing out of here?

260
00:18:32,450 --> 00:18:33,860
That's the monster.

261
00:18:33,860 --> 00:18:36,400
It finally reared its ugly head.

262
00:18:36,400 --> 00:18:42,820
Is it possible that I'd get billed
for compensation instead?

263
00:18:42,820 --> 00:18:45,570
You weren't cheating on her, were you?

264
00:18:45,570 --> 00:18:47,280
I wouldn't do such a thing,
I'm telling you.

265
00:18:47,280 --> 00:18:48,000
Sensei.

266
00:18:48,000 --> 00:18:51,610
Getting compensation might be
impossible this time around.

267
00:18:51,610 --> 00:18:54,250
That's right. There have no savings.

268
00:18:54,970 --> 00:18:56,140
No.

269
00:18:56,400 --> 00:18:57,730
There is a way.

270
00:18:57,730 --> 00:18:59,050
Huh?

271
00:19:00,430 --> 00:19:02,220
She might have no savings,

272
00:19:02,220 --> 00:19:05,080
but she can't escape the
obligation to make compensation.

273
00:19:06,390 --> 00:19:08,140
What does this mean?

274
00:19:08,140 --> 00:19:11,480
If she has no money,
how would she pay?

275
00:19:12,310 --> 00:19:17,020
Upon the divorce agreement, she simply must
acknowledge the obligation for compensation.

276
00:19:17,020 --> 00:19:19,870
She has ten years to make
the full compensation.

277
00:19:19,870 --> 00:19:22,830
In other words, even if she can't
pay now, after the divorce,

278
00:19:22,830 --> 00:19:26,370
we can demand any income
she earns after the divorce.

279
00:19:26,370 --> 00:19:29,300
Even after ten years,
there can be another hearing,

280
00:19:26,470 --> 00:19:36,510
Compensation Timetable

281
00:19:26,470 --> 00:19:36,510
Normally three years, but can be extended to 10 years
at the time of divorce agreement. (If there is another trial,
it can be prolonged another 10 more years)

282
00:19:29,570 --> 00:19:31,640
at which time, she would be

283
00:19:31,640 --> 00:19:35,770
given another ten years to
make the full compensation.

284
00:19:35,770 --> 00:19:37,550
I see.

285
00:19:37,550 --> 00:19:39,700
Ten years.

286
00:19:39,700 --> 00:19:42,170
What an exhausting thought.

287
00:19:42,170 --> 00:19:46,710
Let that monster suffer for
ten years, for twenty years!

288
00:19:47,590 --> 00:19:51,300
But, this time around,
we're taking a faster route.

289
00:19:52,890 --> 00:19:54,610
How is that?

290
00:19:55,520 --> 00:19:59,300
Ichikawa-san, are you familiar
with property distribution?

291
00:20:00,400 --> 00:20:01,410
No...

292
00:20:01,410 --> 00:20:07,430
Halving of assets on occasion of divorce
is standard practice of property distribution,

293
00:20:08,610 --> 00:20:12,680
regardless of who initiates the divorce.

294
00:20:12,680 --> 00:20:14,180
Half.

295
00:20:14,630 --> 00:20:20,520
Therefore, we deduct the
compensation from this half.

296
00:20:21,170 --> 00:20:22,910
How does that work?

297
00:20:22,910 --> 00:20:26,100
The assets are close
to zero to begin with.

298
00:20:26,100 --> 00:20:31,410
The term "assets" does not
only refer to savings.

299
00:20:31,410 --> 00:20:32,460
Huh?

300
00:20:33,330 --> 00:20:37,980
The biggest asset between you two
is your condominium, correct?

301
00:20:39,390 --> 00:20:40,990
Ah.

302
00:20:41,250 --> 00:20:43,080
So she has an asset!

303
00:20:43,080 --> 00:20:47,250
When the condominium gets sold,
even after the remaining loan is paid off,

304
00:20:47,530 --> 00:20:49,370
there should be some left over.

305
00:20:50,080 --> 00:20:55,630
Half of it is supposed
to go to your wife.

306
00:20:56,350 --> 00:21:02,300
In that case, we take our
compensation from here.

307
00:21:03,070 --> 00:21:04,260
I see.

308
00:21:04,000 --> 00:21:16,280
Compensation can be taken out of the property distribution.  It is essential to elucidate the details carefully in the divorce agreement.

309
00:21:04,000 --> 00:21:16,280
When the other party is a housewife

310
00:21:04,260 --> 00:21:06,030
That might work.

311
00:21:06,030 --> 00:21:08,420
Good job, Sensei!

312
00:21:09,640 --> 00:21:13,320
Well, Ichikawa-san, let's
move on to the next stage.

313
00:21:13,320 --> 00:21:16,160
We have to draft a divorce agreement.

314
00:21:16,160 --> 00:21:19,090
Kanae-san, will you please
help with the drafting?

315
00:21:19,090 --> 00:21:20,360
I will.

316
00:21:21,540 --> 00:21:25,410
Ichikawa-san. We're finally
about to reach the climax.

317
00:21:26,000 --> 00:21:27,090
Yes.

318
00:21:27,510 --> 00:21:29,880
I will leave it in your capable hands.

319
00:21:31,080 --> 00:21:34,010
Oh, yes, there's one more thing.

320
00:21:34,270 --> 00:21:36,330
We need to make a first move.

321
00:21:38,330 --> 00:21:39,270
Kurumi-san.

322
00:21:40,730 --> 00:21:44,950
We need to teach that
selfish monster a lesson.

323
00:21:46,870 --> 00:21:49,730
Make my day, monster.

324
00:22:02,010 --> 00:22:07,400
Thank you. You're all so good.

325
00:22:07,850 --> 00:22:10,780
What do you mean?
You're good, too, Ichikawa-san.

326
00:22:10,780 --> 00:22:12,980
Really.

327
00:22:12,980 --> 00:22:16,580
I know, and I'm even
taking karaoke lessons.

328
00:22:17,290 --> 00:22:21,120
I wonder if I should take classes, too.

329
00:22:21,120 --> 00:22:24,580
But I have tea ceremony and koto lessons...

330
00:22:24,580 --> 00:22:27,610
I'm so busy every day.

331
00:22:27,610 --> 00:22:30,190
I know, right?

332
00:22:30,190 --> 00:22:31,300
Um...

333
00:22:31,300 --> 00:22:36,500
Ichikawa-san, you haven't
touched your drink at all.

334
00:22:36,500 --> 00:22:39,980
That's right. Come on. Let's drink up.

335
00:22:42,430 --> 00:22:45,110
Ichikawa-san, what are
you singing next?

336
00:22:45,110 --> 00:22:47,770
Oh... then, Beyonce.

337
00:22:47,770 --> 00:22:50,300
Beyonce?

338
00:22:50,300 --> 00:22:52,900
I love Beyonce.

339
00:22:53,190 --> 00:22:55,210
I can't wait.

340
00:22:57,250 --> 00:23:00,150
I'm paying for today.

341
00:23:00,150 --> 00:23:01,700
Are you sure, Ichikawa-san?

342
00:23:01,700 --> 00:23:05,240
Thanks. I'll pay the tab next time.

343
00:23:05,240 --> 00:23:06,810
Thanks, bye.

344
00:23:06,810 --> 00:23:07,760
Here's my card.

345
00:23:07,760 --> 00:23:09,090
Thank you very much.

346
00:23:10,890 --> 00:23:13,310
Miss, I'm very sorry.

347
00:23:13,310 --> 00:23:16,020
It appears your card has been declined.

348
00:23:16,020 --> 00:23:17,860
What? That's impossible.

349
00:23:17,860 --> 00:23:19,820
Would you like to pay with cash?

350
00:23:20,840 --> 00:23:22,220
Yes.

351
00:23:24,000 --> 00:23:25,390
Don't worry about it.

352
00:23:25,390 --> 00:23:26,700
I'll pick up the tab today.

353
00:23:28,600 --> 00:23:29,840
Here's my card.

354
00:23:29,840 --> 00:23:30,930
Thank you very much.

355
00:23:33,110 --> 00:23:34,710
Don't worry about it.

356
00:23:50,610 --> 00:23:52,660
Why aren't you answering?

357
00:24:03,680 --> 00:24:05,410
Are you okay?

358
00:24:05,410 --> 00:24:07,960
Thank you. I'm fine.

359
00:24:11,330 --> 00:24:14,620
So, let's keep a log of anything else

360
00:24:14,620 --> 00:24:15,550
that could lead to further disputes.

361
00:24:15,550 --> 00:24:16,690
Yes.

362
00:24:23,560 --> 00:24:27,130
I know how frustrated you must feel.

363
00:24:28,530 --> 00:24:30,280
I was like you, too.

364
00:24:31,160 --> 00:24:32,300
Huh?

365
00:24:33,750 --> 00:24:37,250
I got divorced just recently.

366
00:24:38,280 --> 00:24:42,310
Hakamada-sensei really helped me out.

367
00:24:42,310 --> 00:24:44,620
And now I can look forward to future.

368
00:24:44,620 --> 00:24:46,200
It's all thanks to him.

369
00:24:48,360 --> 00:24:50,320
I see.

370
00:24:51,000 --> 00:24:52,820
He's a strange man, isn't he?

371
00:25:01,250 --> 00:25:04,620
I have an appraisal of
Ichikawa-san's condominium.

372
00:25:05,920 --> 00:25:09,420
In total, it comes out to
35 million yen.

373
00:25:13,870 --> 00:25:16,210
Deducting the loan payback from that,

374
00:25:16,210 --> 00:25:17,550
it comes out to 14 million yen.

375
00:25:18,130 --> 00:25:24,320
Seven million will be paid to your
wife in the property distribution.

376
00:25:24,910 --> 00:25:26,630
That's quite a lot of money.

377
00:25:27,440 --> 00:25:31,100
We will bill her for the entire amount,
for compensation.

378
00:25:33,010 --> 00:25:35,100
Seven million... the entire amount?

379
00:25:36,190 --> 00:25:38,330
You could say she's getting off cheap.

380
00:25:39,030 --> 00:25:41,770
You earned that money with your
blood, sweat, and tears...

381
00:25:42,330 --> 00:25:45,240
but your wife spent
it all for herself.

382
00:25:45,690 --> 00:25:51,110
This amount represents not only that,
but also the great suffering

383
00:25:51,540 --> 00:25:53,250
that you have endured.

384
00:25:53,610 --> 00:25:57,000
So, let's get compensated.

385
00:26:09,490 --> 00:26:11,800
Misaki

386
00:26:20,440 --> 00:26:21,730
Ichikawa-san.

387
00:26:22,850 --> 00:26:27,980
Now, it's time to clearly express
your intent to divorce to your wife.

388
00:26:30,310 --> 00:26:31,550
Yes.

389
00:26:32,600 --> 00:26:34,080
Are you scared?

390
00:26:36,520 --> 00:26:39,610
Well, yes... to be honest.

391
00:26:40,590 --> 00:26:45,190
Your fear will become money.

392
00:26:46,980 --> 00:26:50,500
My fear... will become money...

393
00:26:50,500 --> 00:26:55,440
So, let's announce your intent
to divorce with a smile.

394
00:27:03,980 --> 00:27:07,920
Hakamada
Law Office

395
00:27:04,580 --> 00:27:07,540
I wonder if Ichikawa-san is okay.

396
00:27:07,920 --> 00:27:10,190
Wouldn't it be better for him
to quietly divorce her,

397
00:27:10,190 --> 00:27:14,060
instead of trying to get compensation?

398
00:27:14,430 --> 00:27:18,510
People subjected to domestic violence
and moral harassment for long periods

399
00:27:19,210 --> 00:27:23,380
often come to believe that
they are weak people.

400
00:27:24,310 --> 00:27:27,800
And they have a tendency
to rely on the perpetrators.

401
00:27:30,110 --> 00:27:33,380
I can relate, a little.

402
00:27:33,380 --> 00:27:35,400
What's essential for
Ichikawa-san right now...

403
00:27:38,850 --> 00:27:41,680
is for him to reclaim his former self.

404
00:27:53,170 --> 00:27:57,390
To do that, he must also
demand compensation.

405
00:28:05,200 --> 00:28:09,080
Is all this that so-called
Hakamada's idea?

406
00:28:10,520 --> 00:28:13,460
You put a stop on my card, didn't you?

407
00:28:17,970 --> 00:28:22,560
Do you have any idea
how humiliated I was?

408
00:28:22,560 --> 00:28:26,160
We need to talk.

409
00:28:27,610 --> 00:28:29,100
About what?

410
00:28:31,070 --> 00:28:33,570
So, let's announce your intent
to divorce with a smile.

411
00:28:47,850 --> 00:28:49,280
Please divorce me.

412
00:28:58,410 --> 00:28:59,530
Please.

413
00:29:03,590 --> 00:29:04,560
I would...

414
00:29:12,880 --> 00:29:14,670
like to separate.

415
00:29:40,840 --> 00:29:42,200
Ichikawa-san.

416
00:29:46,420 --> 00:29:48,670
As you said, Sensei,

417
00:29:48,960 --> 00:29:51,110
I told her with a smile.

418
00:29:51,110 --> 00:29:55,280
She said she'll keep me
as her pet until I die.

419
00:29:56,340 --> 00:29:57,850
I see.

420
00:29:58,810 --> 00:30:05,210
But, I feel like I was finally
able to look her in the eyes.

421
00:30:08,640 --> 00:30:10,660
That's the first I've seen you smile.

422
00:30:11,770 --> 00:30:13,510
That's what matters.

423
00:30:15,110 --> 00:30:19,010
Because all I can do is help
you with the legal aspects.

424
00:30:20,590 --> 00:30:24,140
It is you who must fight.

425
00:30:27,410 --> 00:30:28,290
Yes.

426
00:30:39,600 --> 00:30:42,190
We have come here today

427
00:30:42,190 --> 00:30:47,080
to ask your consent in divorcing your
husband, Ichikawa Tomohiro-san.

428
00:30:48,700 --> 00:30:51,930
You guys just don't let up, do you?

429
00:30:51,930 --> 00:30:53,370
Kanae-san.

430
00:30:56,890 --> 00:30:58,170
Misaki-san,

431
00:30:58,520 --> 00:31:01,950
over the past five years,
you have spent five million yen

432
00:31:01,950 --> 00:31:07,080
of your husband's hard-earned money
on expensive brand-name items, beauty treatments,

433
00:31:07,410 --> 00:31:09,950
and extravagant dinners
with your high-society friends.

434
00:31:10,660 --> 00:31:12,570
Not to mention domestic violence...

435
00:31:10,690 --> 00:31:18,460
Diagnosis Report

436
00:31:13,030 --> 00:31:14,790
Verbal abuse...

437
00:31:16,910 --> 00:31:18,460
I'm...

438
00:31:19,200 --> 00:31:20,590
I'm...

439
00:31:21,480 --> 00:31:23,150
You're what?

440
00:31:24,010 --> 00:31:25,240
Say it.

441
00:31:28,590 --> 00:31:31,140
I'm... I'm doing the best I can!

442
00:31:36,330 --> 00:31:39,800
Who do you think you're
talking to, you piece of trash?

443
00:31:40,160 --> 00:31:42,190
Please, forgive me!

444
00:31:42,190 --> 00:31:44,710
Have you forgotten how to apologize?

445
00:31:45,040 --> 00:31:47,820
Get on your knees and beg.

446
00:31:47,820 --> 00:31:52,390
Demanding that someone get on their knees
against their will can be considered illegal.

447
00:31:52,990 --> 00:31:55,530
If you still insist you're
not the perpetrator

448
00:31:55,530 --> 00:31:58,000
with sufficient reason for divorce,

449
00:31:58,000 --> 00:32:00,630
then we will have to
take matters to court.

450
00:32:01,080 --> 00:32:06,610
Even in court, I assure you, they
will decide in favor of the divorce.

451
00:32:07,200 --> 00:32:08,590
In that case,

452
00:32:09,030 --> 00:32:13,510
you will be billed to compensate your husband's
psychological and physical anguish,

453
00:32:13,960 --> 00:32:18,170
as well as repayment for your personal expenditures.

454
00:32:18,660 --> 00:32:21,570
The total will be seven million yen.

455
00:32:22,620 --> 00:32:24,360
Seven million?

456
00:32:24,360 --> 00:32:26,450
That's impossible!

457
00:32:26,450 --> 00:32:28,890
You saw my bank ledger, didn't you?

458
00:32:30,280 --> 00:32:32,360
Please don't worry.

459
00:32:33,190 --> 00:32:37,550
Here is the appraisal
of this condominium.

460
00:32:36,270 --> 00:32:39,070
Condominium Appraisal Report

461
00:32:38,020 --> 00:32:41,420
Out of the sum you will receive
from the sale of the condominium,

462
00:32:41,810 --> 00:32:46,370
by property distribution,
one half will become yours.

463
00:32:47,080 --> 00:32:51,290
In other words, you are
entitled to one half

464
00:32:51,290 --> 00:32:57,910
of 14 million yen after the divorce,
and paying back the loan.

465
00:32:58,440 --> 00:33:03,530
Therefore, you will be paying
zero out of pocket.

466
00:33:04,740 --> 00:33:06,890
Misaki-san, how lucky for you,

467
00:33:06,890 --> 00:33:09,970
that you won't have to dig
into your own savings.

468
00:33:12,240 --> 00:33:14,140
So, do you agree?

469
00:33:17,860 --> 00:33:19,950
I'll say it again,

470
00:33:19,950 --> 00:33:21,780
I said I won't agree to a divorce!

471
00:33:21,780 --> 00:33:24,280
Stamp and sign this.

472
00:33:24,280 --> 00:33:25,220
Please!

473
00:33:25,220 --> 00:33:26,460
Please set me free!

474
00:33:26,460 --> 00:33:27,590
Absolutely not!

475
00:33:28,050 --> 00:33:30,710
If you will not agree,

476
00:33:30,710 --> 00:33:33,500
then we have no choice
but to take it to court.

477
00:33:34,750 --> 00:33:39,350
However, if it comes down to that,
there will be court fees, attorney fees,

478
00:33:39,650 --> 00:33:43,410
in which case, in all eventuality, your
settlement will be next to nothing.

479
00:33:44,990 --> 00:33:46,600
Are you all right with that?

480
00:33:49,250 --> 00:33:50,650
Do what you want.

481
00:33:50,650 --> 00:33:52,840
Why do you not want to divorce?

482
00:33:53,810 --> 00:33:57,140
You wanted your husband's
attention, didn't you?

483
00:34:02,150 --> 00:34:04,620
We have done some investigating.

484
00:34:07,590 --> 00:34:09,070
Thank you very much.

485
00:34:09,920 --> 00:34:12,360
Um... thank you.

486
00:34:12,360 --> 00:34:15,290
Don't worry. We have to
have each other's backs.

487
00:34:15,290 --> 00:34:19,690
But, it's not easy to associate
with people like that...

488
00:34:19,690 --> 00:34:21,420
All the money in the
world won't be enough.

489
00:34:21,420 --> 00:34:23,600
I know.

490
00:34:27,410 --> 00:34:31,480
Misaki-san, you were lonely.

491
00:34:32,520 --> 00:34:34,580
Since you've moved into
this condominium,

492
00:34:35,380 --> 00:34:37,580
you've had no friends.

493
00:34:38,960 --> 00:34:43,470
On top of that, your husband has
been working overtime until late.

494
00:34:44,390 --> 00:34:51,000
And it was in this situation that
you met the local high-society wives.

495
00:34:51,570 --> 00:34:53,490
It's beautiful.

496
00:34:52,830 --> 00:34:55,230
This? It's from Paris.

497
00:34:55,230 --> 00:34:55,770
From Paris?

498
00:34:55,770 --> 00:34:58,140
Did you go to Paris?

499
00:35:03,520 --> 00:35:05,390
You dropped this.

500
00:35:05,390 --> 00:35:07,800
Oh, thank you!

501
00:35:07,800 --> 00:35:09,750
This is my favorite handkerchief.

502
00:35:09,750 --> 00:35:11,400
Thank you so much.

503
00:35:11,400 --> 00:35:13,070
I'm so glad.

504
00:35:12,470 --> 00:35:13,050
Bye, now.

505
00:35:15,110 --> 00:35:16,170
Wait a moment...

506
00:35:16,170 --> 00:35:22,330
That started the deepening of your
relationship with those women...

507
00:35:22,330 --> 00:35:28,430
However, the money it took to
associate with them was exorbitant.

508
00:35:28,740 --> 00:35:33,810
But you didn't want to leave
your new friends behind...

509
00:35:34,390 --> 00:35:38,070
and you continued seeing them,
though you didn't have the means.

510
00:35:42,750 --> 00:35:44,970
The expenditures became
a matter of course,

511
00:35:45,440 --> 00:35:47,870
but you couldn't stop yourself.

512
00:35:49,940 --> 00:35:52,170
You wanted to confide
in your husband, didn't you?

513
00:35:52,550 --> 00:35:59,620
But instead, your attitude toward
him became increasingly cold...

514
00:36:00,250 --> 00:36:02,020
and kept escalating.

515
00:36:07,850 --> 00:36:09,070
Misaki...

516
00:36:10,310 --> 00:36:15,150
Is that true? Because if it is...

517
00:36:16,950 --> 00:36:18,770
Of course not!

518
00:36:19,240 --> 00:36:20,850
Are you stupid?

519
00:36:20,850 --> 00:36:23,620
What do you know about me, anyway?

520
00:36:23,620 --> 00:36:26,220
Do you think you're some TV detective?

521
00:36:29,220 --> 00:36:33,080
I worked hard...

522
00:36:33,670 --> 00:36:34,780
I...

523
00:36:36,700 --> 00:36:38,710
I wanted you to have a good life.

524
00:36:37,800 --> 00:36:39,880
I said, you're wrong!

525
00:36:41,950 --> 00:36:43,610
Why...

526
00:36:45,870 --> 00:36:47,910
Why didn't you tell me?!

527
00:36:49,610 --> 00:36:51,830
If you were lonely,
why didn't you just say so?!

528
00:36:52,240 --> 00:36:54,830
If keeping up appearances was difficult,
why didn't you speak up?!

529
00:36:55,810 --> 00:36:57,620
Why didn't you tell me?!

530
00:37:00,120 --> 00:37:01,340
I did.

531
00:37:04,490 --> 00:37:06,960
I told you over and over!

532
00:37:11,610 --> 00:37:13,350
Honey, you know...

533
00:37:13,350 --> 00:37:18,040
I don't know if I like
this condominium...

534
00:37:18,910 --> 00:37:21,430
This subject again?

535
00:37:21,430 --> 00:37:24,520
This is an important time for me.
I might get promoted.

536
00:37:24,520 --> 00:37:26,050
I don't have time to move elsewhere.

537
00:37:27,520 --> 00:37:30,180
But, Tomohiro, you see...

538
00:37:30,180 --> 00:37:34,260
Sorry, but let's talk
about it some other time.

539
00:37:38,240 --> 00:37:43,090
Nonetheless, you have vexed your
husband for many long years,

540
00:37:43,090 --> 00:37:46,780
and for that, you will have to pay.

541
00:37:48,400 --> 00:37:49,540
Your guilt is not expunged.

542
00:37:49,540 --> 00:37:50,700
That's enough.

543
00:37:50,700 --> 00:37:52,660
I've had enough of this drama.

544
00:37:54,520 --> 00:37:58,480
If you want a divorce
that badly, it's yours.

545
00:38:28,310 --> 00:38:29,530
Wait.

546
00:38:52,600 --> 00:38:54,170
Honey...

547
00:38:54,820 --> 00:38:58,940
If only I had been more
attentive to you...

548
00:39:10,170 --> 00:39:13,120
Misaki. Let's start over.

549
00:39:16,230 --> 00:39:19,910
I now know, that I'm the one
that turned you into a monster...

550
00:39:22,890 --> 00:39:28,740
...because I kept running away.

551
00:39:34,030 --> 00:39:38,670
Let's start all over again.

552
00:39:43,510 --> 00:39:45,550
I am sorry...

553
00:39:51,650 --> 00:39:55,570
I am sorry...

554
00:40:18,570 --> 00:40:19,850
Sensei.

555
00:40:21,510 --> 00:40:22,970
Um... Sensei.

556
00:40:23,250 --> 00:40:24,630
What is it?

557
00:40:25,570 --> 00:40:30,460
You knew this was going
to happen, didn't you?

558
00:40:32,950 --> 00:40:35,460
I think you knew how it
was all going to unfold.

559
00:40:37,670 --> 00:40:40,000
All I did was clean
up the contradictions.

560
00:40:40,630 --> 00:40:44,380
She said she wouldn't divorce,
while saying their marriage was sexless.

561
00:40:45,370 --> 00:40:47,790
She never took off her wedding ring.

562
00:40:50,430 --> 00:40:52,780
Misaki-san was full of contradictions.

563
00:40:57,550 --> 00:40:59,020
Let's go back.

564
00:41:19,490 --> 00:41:22,580
I would've never guessed
you could do that...

565
00:41:22,580 --> 00:41:27,490
there are ways to get compensation
from housewives without income.

566
00:41:27,490 --> 00:41:29,330
I was surprised, too.

567
00:41:31,210 --> 00:41:34,850
Monster wives really
do exist, don't they?

568
00:41:34,850 --> 00:41:37,070
Five years from now,
you will become one.

569
00:41:37,070 --> 00:41:39,430
What? Me?

570
00:41:41,290 --> 00:41:43,140
I feel it.

571
00:41:43,140 --> 00:41:44,960
How rude.

572
00:41:44,960 --> 00:41:46,730
Why would you say that?

573
00:41:46,730 --> 00:41:49,630
Because I can see it.

574
00:41:50,610 --> 00:41:51,530
Huh?

575
00:41:55,070 --> 00:41:57,190
Ouch.

576
00:41:58,340 --> 00:42:00,110
You should be careful.

577
00:42:07,360 --> 00:42:08,620
Well...

578
00:42:08,620 --> 00:42:13,060
Are you saying Hakamada-sensei didn't
get compensation fees this time?

579
00:42:21,280 --> 00:42:22,300
Huh?

580
00:42:24,940 --> 00:42:26,670
Sensei, we're in trouble!

581
00:42:24,940 --> 00:42:36,210
Next episode

582
00:42:26,670 --> 00:42:30,040
There's a line of people out there.

583
00:42:27,140 --> 00:42:30,040
The Hakamada Law Office in great peril?!

584
00:42:30,040 --> 00:42:32,580
My husband is cheating on me.

585
00:42:32,580 --> 00:42:36,210
A controlling wife, traditional man, wrestler woman:

586
00:42:32,580 --> 00:42:36,220
We can't get compensation
for such a minor thing...

587
00:42:34,540 --> 00:42:36,210
Hakamada in a big crisis!!

588
00:42:36,220 --> 00:42:38,050
I will never fail to get compensated!

589
00:42:36,280 --> 00:42:39,920
This drama is a work of fiction

590
00:42:38,050 --> 00:42:39,390
What's going on here?
