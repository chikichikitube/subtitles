Don't make that face

34
00:00:38,260 --> 00:00:39,520
How come that every time we do this the weather always sucks?

35
00:00:39,520 --> 00:00:40,580
How come that every time we do this the weather always sucks?

36
00:00:40,580 --> 00:00:41,640
How come that every time we do this the weather always sucks?

37
00:00:41,640 --> 00:00:43,120
It's always like this with him

38
00:00:43,120 --> 00:00:44,240
I know, right?

39
00:00:44,240 --> 00:00:47,120
It's chilling, really

40
00:00:45,360 --> 00:00:47,120
Yeah, it's cold

41
00:00:47,120 --> 00:00:51,150
Let me just get this one clear for you

42
00:00:51,150 --> 00:00:52,080
I didn't mean that but yeah, it's cold

43
00:00:52,080 --> 00:00:53,250
I didn't mean that but yeah, it's cold

44
00:00:53,250 --> 00:00:55,120
I had to make this clear

45
00:00:55,240 --> 00:00:56,580
What a day

46
00:00:56,580 --> 00:00:58,580
I guess we're doing this today?

47
00:00:56,580 --> 00:00:58,580
Man...

48
00:00:58,880 --> 00:01:01,280
"Ghostbusters"

49
00:00:59,880 --> 00:01:01,280
Isn't this too much?

50
00:01:01,280 --> 00:01:03,820
You know, our staff has like

51
00:01:03,820 --> 00:01:08,020
A list with different options for this series

52
00:01:08,020 --> 00:01:10,680
I know for sure that he clearly spotted this one

53
00:01:10,680 --> 00:01:12,650
I know for sure that he clearly spotted this one

54
00:01:12,650 --> 00:01:13,740
You think so?

55
00:01:13,040 --> 00:01:14,550
He really did?

56
00:01:13,740 --> 00:01:15,680
But he never actually does it

57
00:01:15,680 --> 00:01:16,920
Well, yeah

58
00:01:16,220 --> 00:01:16,950
He never does as planned in our meetings

59
00:01:16,950 --> 00:01:18,280
He never does as planned in our meetings

60
00:01:18,280 --> 00:01:19,320
He never does as planned in our meetings

61
00:01:19,320 --> 00:01:20,520
Right

62
00:01:20,520 --> 00:01:22,850
And then he blows his fuse

Headed to the meeting spot

68
00:01:34,150 --> 00:01:38,450
Headed to the meeting spot

69
00:01:34,560 --> 00:01:35,680
Where's senpai?

70
00:01:35,680 --> 00:01:37,650
Right, where is he?

71
00:01:35,980 --> 00:01:37,650
Yeah...

72
00:01:37,650 --> 00:01:38,450
I'm worried

73
00:01:38,450 --> 00:01:40,760
Shouldn't we ghostbusters be indoors?

74
00:01:40,880 --> 00:01:42,120
I guess so

75
00:01:42,120 --> 00:01:44,120
We shouldn't even pop out during daytime...

76
00:01:44,120 --> 00:01:45,420
There's something there

77
00:01:45,420 --> 00:01:46,240
Huh?

78
00:01:46,820 --> 00:01:49,840
"Ghostbusters class - assembly here"

79
00:01:49,840 --> 00:01:50,480
I see

80
00:01:50,480 --> 00:01:52,160
Is he gonna show up then?

81
00:01:52,160 --> 00:01:54,220
Man it's cold

82
00:01:53,040 --> 00:01:54,920
Yeah...

83
00:01:54,220 --> 00:01:56,380
Oh, I don't mean it that way

84
00:01:56,380 --> 00:01:58,670
I thought so

85
00:01:57,560 --> 00:01:58,670
Uhh

86
00:01:59,200 --> 00:02:00,780
Wow

87
00:02:00,780 --> 00:02:02,380
Ghostbuster!!

88
00:02:00,780 --> 00:02:02,380
Ghostbuster!!

89
00:02:02,380 --> 00:02:03,980
He's finally here

90
00:02:02,740 --> 00:02:03,980
From so far away...

91
00:02:03,980 --> 00:02:04,980
So grand

92
00:02:04,980 --> 00:02:06,420
Ghostbuster!!

93
00:02:04,980 --> 00:02:06,420
Ghostbuster!!

94
00:02:06,420 --> 00:02:07,620
What--

95
00:02:07,620 --> 00:02:09,900
How should we react to this?

96
00:02:09,900 --> 00:02:11,400
Ghostbuster!!

97
00:02:11,400 --> 00:02:12,800
Sometimes it's like this

98
00:02:12,800 --> 00:02:13,920
Let's go with it

99
00:02:13,820 --> 00:02:15,880
Ghostbuster!!

100
00:02:13,920 --> 00:02:15,880
Impressive

101
00:02:15,880 --> 00:02:18,260
Is that it?

102
00:02:16,420 --> 00:02:18,260
His voice is so loud today

103
00:02:18,260 --> 00:02:19,780
Ghostbuster!!

104
00:02:19,780 --> 00:02:21,200
Something's off

105
00:02:21,200 --> 00:02:23,000
Ghostbuster!!

106
00:02:23,800 --> 00:02:25,080
This sucks

107
00:02:25,080 --> 00:02:26,090
Ok

108
00:02:26,680 --> 00:02:28,320
Good job today

109
00:02:28,880 --> 00:02:30,580
Come again tomorrow, will you?

110
00:02:30,580 --> 00:02:31,460

111
00:02:31,460 --> 00:02:32,980
Counting on you for tomorrow too

112
00:02:32,980 --> 00:02:34,520
5'000 yen?

113
00:02:33,400 --> 00:02:34,520
He paid him

114
00:02:34,520 --> 00:02:35,680
Masahiro

115
00:02:35,040 --> 00:02:35,680
Yes?

116
00:02:35,680 --> 00:02:37,920
How about tomorrow? Can you make it?

117
00:02:37,920 --> 00:02:40,650
Yep

118
00:02:40,650 --> 00:02:42,070
Alright?

119
00:02:41,140 --> 00:02:42,070
Yes

120
00:02:44,050 --> 00:02:45,250
Good job

121
00:02:45,250 --> 00:02:46,450
Alright then, call me if a ghost pops out, ok?

122
00:02:46,450 --> 00:02:47,720
Alright then, call me if a ghost pops out, ok?

123
00:02:47,720 --> 00:02:48,840
Alright then, call me if a ghost pops out, ok?

124
00:02:48,840 --> 00:02:49,640
Sure

125
00:02:49,640 --> 00:02:51,420

127
00:02:51,420 --> 00:02:53,450
He told them to meet again tomorrow...

128
00:02:51,620 --> 00:02:53,450

129
00:02:53,450 --> 00:02:55,080
What about tomorrow?

134
00:02:58,380 --> 00:02:59,420
Here we are

135
00:02:59,480 --> 00:03:05,580
Murakami Shoji

136
00:02:59,480 --> 00:03:05,580
Murakami Shoji

137
00:03:00,760 --> 00:03:05,250
Here comes our Murakami Shoji, back from his brief impromptu act

138
00:03:06,520 --> 00:03:10,580
You know, japanese people don't want to do ghostbusters anymore

139
00:03:10,580 --> 00:03:11,280
So I had to hide foreigners, it's awkward

140
00:03:11,280 --> 00:03:12,320
So I had to hide foreigners, it's awkward

141
00:03:12,320 --> 00:03:13,120
So I had to hide foreigners, it's awkward

142
00:03:13,120 --> 00:03:14,350
What the-?

143
00:03:14,620 --> 00:03:16,540
Come again?

144
00:03:14,620 --> 00:03:16,540
What is he saying--?

145
00:03:16,540 --> 00:03:18,180
"Hide" them...?

146
00:03:16,540 --> 00:03:18,180
I don't get it

147
00:03:18,180 --> 00:03:18,850
I had to hire foreigners, that's what I said!

148
00:03:18,850 --> 00:03:20,120
I had to hire foreigners, that's what I said!

149
00:03:20,120 --> 00:03:21,060
I had to hire foreigners, that's what I said!

150
00:03:21,060 --> 00:03:22,180
Alright, alright

151
00:03:22,180 --> 00:03:23,540
Can I ask you one thing?

152
00:03:23,540 --> 00:03:25,050
What?

153
00:03:25,220 --> 00:03:25,550

154
00:03:25,550 --> 00:03:27,120
Bro, for how long do you think this class is going to last?

155
00:03:27,120 --> 00:03:27,650
Bro, for how long do you think this class is going to last?

156
00:03:27,650 --> 00:03:30,020
Bro, for how long do you think this class is going to last?

157
00:03:30,260 --> 00:03:31,640
Let's see...

158
00:03:32,280 --> 00:03:34,260
Your bro is planning to go for---

161
00:03:37,420 --> 00:03:39,380
You can't call me bro here!

162
00:03:39,650 --> 00:03:41,620
It's "captain"

163
00:03:41,620 --> 00:03:43,420
Ah, captain

164
00:03:42,020 --> 00:03:43,420

165
00:03:43,920 --> 00:03:46,120
For how long, is that what you asked?

166
00:03:46,280 --> 00:03:46,880
It's gonna last till you become qualified!

167
00:03:46,880 --> 00:03:49,380
It's gonna last till you become qualified!

168
00:03:49,380 --> 00:03:52,250
You can never clear a sinnnnngle thing

169
00:03:52,440 --> 00:03:53,780
Since we did Ninjas

170
00:03:53,780 --> 00:03:54,120
None of you became a ninja!

171
00:03:54,120 --> 00:03:57,250
None of you became a ninja!

172
00:03:57,650 --> 00:03:58,320
I got a load of calls from my boss, you know

173
00:03:58,320 --> 00:04:00,220
I got a load of calls from my boss, you know

174
00:04:00,220 --> 00:04:00,780
He told me to get my shit together!

175
00:04:00,780 --> 00:04:02,780
He told me to get my shit together!

176
00:04:03,380 --> 00:04:04,050
Captain, you have such a powerful voice today

177
00:04:04,050 --> 00:04:04,380
Captain, you have such a powerful voice today

178
00:04:04,380 --> 00:04:06,020
Captain, you have such a powerful voice today

179
00:04:06,020 --> 00:04:07,980
It's incredible

180
00:04:06,280 --> 00:04:12,850

181
00:04:06,280 --> 00:04:12,850

184
00:04:06,480 --> 00:04:08,920
You can tell he's feeling really good today

185
00:04:09,140 --> 00:04:10,600
His voice is amazing

186
00:04:09,560 --> 00:04:12,850
Really powerful

187
00:04:10,600 --> 00:04:12,850
He's in shape

188
00:04:13,260 --> 00:04:14,580
First off

189
00:04:14,580 --> 00:04:17,480
Ghostbusters can't win with bare hands

190
00:04:15,860 --> 00:04:17,480
Yes

191
00:04:17,480 --> 00:04:18,020
Yes

192
00:04:18,020 --> 00:04:19,150
Got it?

193
00:04:18,380 --> 00:04:19,150
Yes

194
00:04:19,150 --> 00:04:20,950
I've got some real stuff (weapon) for you here

195
00:04:20,660 --> 00:04:21,700
Really?

196
00:04:20,950 --> 00:04:22,400
I've got some real stuff (weapon) for you here

197
00:04:21,700 --> 00:04:23,020
No way

198
00:04:22,400 --> 00:04:23,660
Of course

199
00:04:23,020 --> 00:04:25,120
I want one

200
00:04:23,660 --> 00:04:25,120
Now we're talking

201
00:04:25,380 --> 00:04:32,950
Ghostbusters Collector's Edition

202
00:04:25,380 --> 00:04:32,950
Ghostbusters classroom, lesson 1

203
00:04:25,380 --> 00:04:32,950
Weapon supply

204
00:04:26,500 --> 00:04:32,520
They'll be given the Ghostbusters' weapon, essential to get rid of ghosts

205
00:04:39,580 --> 00:04:40,740
Woah, look at that

206
00:04:40,740 --> 00:04:42,840
It's pretty big

207
00:04:41,720 --> 00:04:42,840
It is

208
00:04:42,840 --> 00:04:44,300
Be careful with these

209
00:04:44,300 --> 00:04:45,850
Sure

210
00:04:47,260 --> 00:04:49,740
I'm gonna hand them out

211
00:04:49,740 --> 00:04:51,700
This is... it's yours, Matsumoto

212
00:04:52,300 --> 00:04:53,920
Yes

213
00:04:52,700 --> 00:04:53,920
Take it

214
00:04:53,920 --> 00:04:54,880
Here

215
00:04:55,860 --> 00:04:56,480
Thanks

216
00:04:56,480 --> 00:04:58,160
Make sure to backpack it for good

217
00:04:58,160 --> 00:04:59,520
"Backpack it"...?

218
00:04:59,520 --> 00:05:01,160
Endo

219
00:04:59,960 --> 00:05:01,160
Yes

220
00:05:01,300 --> 00:05:02,360
Thanks

221
00:05:01,760 --> 00:05:02,830
"Backpack it---

222
00:05:02,360 --> 00:05:04,700
Why are you repeating that?!

223
00:05:03,560 --> 00:05:04,700
Oh, I'm sorry

224
00:05:06,760 --> 00:05:08,700
It's---

225
00:05:06,760 --> 00:05:09,820
Thank you

226
00:05:08,700 --> 00:05:09,820
It's heavy

227
00:05:09,920 --> 00:05:11,160
Hama-chan

228
00:05:10,300 --> 00:05:11,160
Yes

229
00:05:11,160 --> 00:05:12,420
Thank you

230
00:05:15,580 --> 00:05:16,720
So...

231
00:05:16,720 --> 00:05:18,240
Excuse me, captain...

232
00:05:19,020 --> 00:05:20,220
I don't have any equipment

233
00:05:20,220 --> 00:05:22,580
I don't have any equipment

234
00:05:22,580 --> 00:05:24,980
You want it?

235
00:05:23,400 --> 00:05:24,980
I do

236
00:05:24,980 --> 00:05:26,750
Come here!

237
00:05:25,640 --> 00:05:26,750
Yes

238
00:05:26,750 --> 00:05:29,250
You others just wait here

239
00:05:27,980 --> 00:05:29,250
Sure

240
00:05:29,250 --> 00:05:31,820
Why does this always happen?

241
00:05:30,640 --> 00:05:31,820
I wonder why

242
00:05:31,820 --> 00:05:34,720
Complaining is the only thing you're all good at

243
00:05:35,520 --> 00:05:37,620
Wow...

244
00:05:36,040 --> 00:05:37,620
Oh my

245
00:05:37,620 --> 00:05:38,880
Impressive

246
00:05:38,880 --> 00:05:40,420
What a bother

247
00:05:40,420 --> 00:05:41,880
Woah...

248
00:05:44,480 --> 00:05:48,250
That's a big handicap

249
00:05:47,080 --> 00:05:48,250
Huh?

250
00:05:48,840 --> 00:05:50,140
And now

251
00:05:50,880 --> 00:05:52,000
Everything alright?

252
00:05:52,000 --> 00:05:53,920
This is a washing machine

253
00:05:53,020 --> 00:05:53,920
Are you dumb?

254
00:05:53,920 --> 00:05:54,620
Where does it look like a washing machine to you?

255
00:05:54,620 --> 00:05:56,220
Where does it look like a washing machine to you?

256
00:05:56,220 --> 00:05:56,850
I mean---

257
00:05:56,850 --> 00:05:57,580
Where does it---

258
00:05:57,580 --> 00:05:58,380
From which angle does it look like one?!

259
00:05:58,380 --> 00:05:59,940
From which angle does it look like one?!

260
00:05:59,940 --> 00:06:02,280
I'm asking you: from which angle?!

261
00:06:02,280 --> 00:06:04,040
I mean, it's pretty obvious---

262
00:06:04,040 --> 00:06:07,380
What's obvious?! How is this a washing machine?!

263
00:06:06,160 --> 00:06:07,380
I told you so

264
00:06:08,040 --> 00:06:09,020
I'm talking to you

265
00:06:09,020 --> 00:06:10,140
He's so pissed off

266
00:06:10,140 --> 00:06:12,500
How is this one? Huh?

267
00:06:12,500 --> 00:06:13,120
Apologize

268
00:06:13,120 --> 00:06:15,380
It's only lighter

269
00:06:13,120 --> 00:06:15,380
You brat

270
00:06:15,380 --> 00:06:17,350
"Pour", "rinse", "evaporate"

271
00:06:17,350 --> 00:06:19,780
It's a washing machine

272
00:06:19,780 --> 00:06:20,220
It's 100% a washing machine

273
00:06:20,220 --> 00:06:21,700
It's 100% a washing machine

274
00:06:21,700 --> 00:06:23,240
I told you so

275
00:06:24,060 --> 00:06:25,850
That's what they want you to think

276
00:06:25,850 --> 00:06:26,820
But it's actually the latest prototype made by NASU

277
00:06:26,820 --> 00:06:30,080
. . . .

278
00:06:26,820 --> 00:06:30,100
But it's actually the latest prototype made by NASU

279
00:06:28,100 --> 00:06:29,220
NASU?!

280
00:06:29,220 --> 00:06:30,100
- NASU...?

281
00:06:30,100 --> 00:06:31,180
You mean Nasu Highlands?

282
00:06:31,380 --> 00:06:32,700
It's the Highlands

283
00:06:32,700 --> 00:06:35,320
I see, the Highlands

284
00:06:33,920 --> 00:06:35,320
You're referring to them?

285
00:06:35,460 --> 00:06:36,400
I meant NASA!

286
00:06:36,400 --> 00:06:37,980
Ah, NASA

287
00:06:36,400 --> 00:06:37,980
With an "A"

288
00:06:37,980 --> 00:06:39,750
We can't let ghosts hear what we say, so I shortened it

289
00:06:39,750 --> 00:06:41,640
We can't let ghosts hear what we say, so I shortened it

290
00:06:40,800 --> 00:06:41,640
Ah, I see

291
00:06:41,640 --> 00:06:43,380
I said NASU instead of NASA

292
00:06:41,640 --> 00:06:43,380
Oh, is that so

293
00:06:43,380 --> 00:06:45,840
Quick, come here Yama-chan

294
00:06:44,220 --> 00:06:45,840
Here

295
00:06:45,840 --> 00:06:47,100
Washing machine, huh?

296
00:06:47,100 --> 00:06:48,080
Kinda, yeah

297
00:06:48,080 --> 00:06:48,880
If that's a washing machine, then wash up your body and mind!

298
00:06:48,880 --> 00:06:49,520
If that's a washing machine, then wash up your body and mind!

299
00:06:49,520 --> 00:06:51,050
If that's a washing machine, then wash up your body and mind!

300
00:06:52,740 --> 00:06:54,750
Always complainin' around...

301
00:06:55,950 --> 00:06:56,850
Where do you think ghosts normally are?

302
00:06:56,850 --> 00:06:58,640
Where do you think ghosts normally are?

303
00:06:58,640 --> 00:06:59,950
Matsumoto?

304
00:07:00,340 --> 00:07:01,920
Let's see... I'd say sheds or attics

305
00:07:01,920 --> 00:07:03,080
Let's see... I'd say sheds or attics

306
00:07:03,080 --> 00:07:04,450
These kinds of places, right?

307
00:07:05,100 --> 00:07:06,680
My sister had a problem with a tooth in the attic, they're dangerous and you shouldn't glet cose

308
00:07:06,680 --> 00:07:07,520
My sister had a problem with a tooth in the attic, they're dangerous and you shouldn't glet cose

309
00:07:07,520 --> 00:07:08,020
My sister had a problem with a tooth in the attic, they're dangerous and you shouldn't glet cose

310
00:07:08,020 --> 00:07:11,820
My sister had a problem with a tooth in the attic, they're dangerous and you shouldn't glet cose

311
00:07:08,020 --> 00:07:11,820
My sister had a problem with a tooth in the attic, they're dangerous and you shouldn't glet cose

312
00:07:13,320 --> 00:07:16,580
The end of that sentence...

313
00:07:15,150 --> 00:07:16,580
It was a mess

314
00:07:16,580 --> 00:07:17,660
So shabby

315
00:07:17,660 --> 00:07:19,020
You know where they are?

316
00:07:20,520 --> 00:07:24,650
It's that place...

317
00:07:26,180 --> 00:07:28,220
What are you laughing at?

318
00:07:28,220 --> 00:07:28,860
I'm sorry

319
00:07:28,860 --> 00:07:30,120
What the heck!

320
00:07:29,420 --> 00:07:30,950
What's wrong?

321
00:07:30,120 --> 00:07:30,950
I just thought...

322
00:07:31,580 --> 00:07:34,780
Maybe he's about to blow his fuse

323
00:07:35,580 --> 00:07:37,120
We said that before

324
00:07:37,220 --> 00:07:40,150
Who said that?

325
00:07:41,420 --> 00:07:43,080
Him?

326
00:07:41,420 --> 00:07:43,080
Sometimes you do that

327
00:07:43,200 --> 00:07:44,870
Hamada?

328
00:07:43,720 --> 00:07:44,870
Yes?

329
00:07:45,160 --> 00:07:46,960
I didn't say that!

330
00:07:46,960 --> 00:07:49,250
You said it, didn't you?

331
00:07:47,660 --> 00:07:49,250
What are you talkin' about?

332
00:07:49,250 --> 00:07:51,850
I'm not blowing any fuse here

333
00:07:50,260 --> 00:07:51,850
Yes, I understand

334
00:07:51,850 --> 00:07:53,020
I've been thinking about the best way to phrase that...

335
00:07:53,020 --> 00:07:54,920
I've been thinking about the best way to phrase that...

336
00:07:54,920 --> 00:07:55,340
Yes

337
00:07:55,340 --> 00:07:57,420
But there are too many drawers inside my head

338
00:07:57,420 --> 00:07:59,400
But there are too many drawers inside my head

339
00:07:58,500 --> 00:07:59,400
Sure

340
00:07:59,400 --> 00:08:00,180
And

341
00:08:00,180 --> 00:08:00,750
It feels like they're empty when I open them

342
00:08:00,750 --> 00:08:02,060
It feels like they're empty when I open them

343
00:08:02,060 --> 00:08:03,550
There goes his fuse

344
00:08:03,550 --> 00:08:05,520
Who said that?!

345
00:08:04,100 --> 00:08:05,520
Sorry

346
00:08:05,520 --> 00:08:08,520
You said that? Matsumoto?

347
00:08:05,960 --> 00:08:08,520
I apologize

348
00:08:09,180 --> 00:08:10,880
It's about time

349
00:08:09,180 --> 00:08:10,880
Yes?

350
00:08:10,880 --> 00:08:11,980
Roger

351
00:08:10,880 --> 00:08:11,980
To start our training

352
00:08:11,980 --> 00:08:14,180
Let's go folks, follow me

353
00:08:11,980 --> 00:08:14,180
Yes

354
00:08:14,180 --> 00:08:15,620
Let's go

355
00:08:14,180 --> 00:08:15,620
Yes

356
00:08:16,080 --> 00:08:16,960
Ghost!

357
00:08:16,960 --> 00:08:17,900
Buster!

358
00:08:17,900 --> 00:08:18,740
Ghost!

359
00:08:18,740 --> 00:08:19,780
Buster!

360
00:08:19,780 --> 00:08:20,600
Ghost!

361
00:08:20,600 --> 00:08:21,540
Buster!

362
00:08:21,540 --> 00:08:22,280
Ghost!

363
00:08:22,280 --> 00:08:23,240
Buster!

364
00:08:23,240 --> 00:08:23,960
Ghost!

365
00:08:23,960 --> 00:08:24,980
Buster!

366
00:08:24,980 --> 00:08:25,700
Ghost!

367
00:08:25,700 --> 00:08:26,700
Buster!

368
00:08:26,700 --> 00:08:27,500
Ghost

369
00:08:27,500 --> 00:08:28,460
Buster...

370
00:08:28,460 --> 00:08:30,280
Ghos---

371
00:08:28,840 --> 00:08:30,280
Yama-chan?

372
00:08:30,860 --> 00:08:32,480
Sorry

373
00:08:32,480 --> 00:08:33,580
What are you doin'?

374
00:08:33,580 --> 00:08:36,350
I think his model is too heavy

375
00:08:33,580 --> 00:08:36,350
That's a bit...

376
00:08:37,080 --> 00:08:41,180
I'm giving my best here, but it's so heavy

377
00:08:41,550 --> 00:08:42,780
Take it off!

378
00:08:42,780 --> 00:08:44,200
Can I just---

379
00:08:43,320 --> 00:08:44,200
Take it off

380
00:08:44,200 --> 00:08:44,950
He's gonna kick him out

381
00:08:44,950 --> 00:08:49,700

What do you know?!

499
00:11:11,050 --> 00:11:11,750
I saw them pointing their fangs at me recently

500
00:11:11,750 --> 00:11:12,080
I saw them pointing their fangs at me recently

501
00:11:12,080 --> 00:11:13,980

Yes! Thank you

517
00:11:30,620 --> 00:11:32,500
But you weren't quick enough to say it

518
00:11:32,500 --> 00:11:34,180
I was surprised to see two of them

519
00:11:34,180 --> 00:11:35,220

You really did great

523
00:11:38,680 --> 00:11:39,120
Normally a person would end up eating one by mistake

524
00:11:39,120 --> 00:11:40,050
Normally a person would end up eating one by mistake

525
00:11:40,050 --> 00:11:40,720
Normally a person would end up eating one by mistake

526
00:11:40,720 --> 00:11:41,540

There's a lot

535
00:11:55,600 --> 00:11:57,320
Eat it up

536
00:11:56,000 --> 00:11:57,320
Don't give up

537
00:11:57,320 --> 00:11:58,260
Be careful

538
00:11:58,260 --> 00:11:59,300
Here comes another

539
00:12:00,020 --> 00:12:01,680
The ghost is about to come

540
00:12:01,680 --> 00:12:03,750
Watch out for it

541
00:12:03,750 --> 00:12:05,880
He's pouring more soba while he's eating

542
00:12:04,500 --> 00:12:05,340
Careful

543
00:12:05,340 --> 00:12:06,850
It's about time

544
00:12:05,880 --> 00:12:07,650
We know for sure it's going to come

545
00:12:07,300 --> 00:12:08,660
It's time

546
00:12:07,650 --> 00:12:09,790
I'm sure of it

547
00:12:08,660 --> 00:12:09,790
Scary

548
00:12:09,650 --> 00:12:12,150
3 minutes later

549
00:12:09,790 --> 00:12:11,020
It's coming

550
00:12:11,020 --> 00:12:13,280
Make sure to shout when you see it

551
00:12:11,680 --> 00:12:13,280
It's time

552
00:12:13,280 --> 00:12:15,650
There's like two times a regular soba portion

553
00:12:14,330 --> 00:12:16,340
He's--- it's not--

554
00:12:15,650 --> 00:12:17,640
There's like two times a regular soba portion

555
00:12:17,640 --> 00:12:19,160
Isn't it about time?

556
00:12:19,160 --> 00:12:20,640
I can't see it

557
00:12:20,640 --> 00:12:21,960
I bet it's going to appear

558
00:12:21,960 --> 00:12:22,840
It should

559
00:12:22,840 --> 00:12:24,400
Here it is

560
00:12:22,840 --> 00:12:24,400
There!

561
00:12:25,020 --> 00:12:26,140
Yes?

562
00:12:27,250 --> 00:12:28,680
You know why I made you undergo this test?

563
00:12:28,680 --> 00:12:30,820
You know why I made you undergo this test?

564
00:12:30,820 --> 00:12:32,280
Why?

565
00:12:33,150 --> 00:12:33,620
Because of your father

566
00:12:33,620 --> 00:12:34,860
Because of your father

567
00:12:34,860 --> 00:12:35,820
Wha-?

568
00:12:36,050 --> 00:12:36,820
When your father used to work at Naniwa Soba...

569
00:12:36,820 --> 00:12:37,550
When your father used to work at Naniwa Soba...

570
00:12:37,550 --> 00:12:39,020
When your father used to work at Naniwa Soba...

571
00:12:39,380 --> 00:12:41,420
He used to play so many pranks on me

572
00:12:41,780 --> 00:12:43,380
He would bring me curry if I'd order soba

573
00:12:43,380 --> 00:12:44,920
He would bring me curry if I'd order soba

574
00:12:45,220 --> 00:12:46,080
I cried so much I couldn't even see in front of me

575
00:12:46,080 --> 00:12:46,750
I cried so much I couldn't even see in front of me

576
00:12:46,750 --> 00:12:48,220
I cried so much I couldn't even see in front of me

577
00:12:49,220 --> 00:12:50,520
But you know what your father said to me that time?

578
00:12:50,520 --> 00:12:51,520
But you know what your father said to me that time?

579
00:12:51,520 --> 00:12:53,780
But you know what your father said to me that time?

580
00:12:54,650 --> 00:12:57,220
"Stay by my side dish"

581
00:12:54,650 --> 00:12:57,220
. .

582
00:13:03,380 --> 00:13:03,720
Alright, you're fired

583
00:13:03,720 --> 00:13:06,320
Alright, you're fired

584
00:13:06,520 --> 00:13:07,540
Eh?!

585
00:13:08,650 --> 00:13:10,720
Am I really fired?

586
00:13:15,080 --> 00:13:17,060
Say you're sorry

587
00:13:15,500 --> 00:13:17,060
Please forgive him

588
00:13:17,060 --> 00:13:20,420
Let this one slide, please

589
00:13:17,060 --> 00:13:20,420
We're sorry, we'll keep on looking for ghosts

590
00:13:20,700 --> 00:13:21,520
I understand

591
00:13:21,520 --> 00:13:22,420
I'm gonna give you another chance

592
00:13:22,420 --> 00:13:22,950
I'm gonna give you another chance

593
00:13:22,950 --> 00:13:23,920
I'm gonna give you another chance

594
00:13:23,920 --> 00:13:25,020
Thank you so much

Ghostbusters classroom, lesson 3

598
00:13:25,520 --> 00:13:29,900
Sometimes when a ghost appears you must hide and wait for a chance

599
00:13:29,900 --> 00:13:32,780
If it spots you, there's no guarantee you'll survive

600
00:13:33,140 --> 00:13:35,660
First off, lie down here

601
00:13:35,660 --> 00:13:39,740
So I can run you over with my bicycle

602
00:13:39,740 --> 00:13:44,280
If you make a sound or shout when I run you over

603
00:13:44,280 --> 00:13:45,580
The ghost will get off his bicycle and slap you

604
00:13:45,580 --> 00:13:46,880
The ghost will get off his bicycle and slap you

605
00:13:46,880 --> 00:13:47,940
The ghost will get off his bicycle and slap you

606
00:13:47,940 --> 00:13:49,960
The ghost is riding a bicycle?!

607
00:13:50,560 --> 00:13:52,720
With that being said, Matsumoto

608
00:13:51,920 --> 00:13:52,720
Yes?

609
00:13:52,720 --> 00:13:53,840
Your turn

610
00:13:53,840 --> 00:13:56,080
Do I have to lie down?

611
00:13:54,780 --> 00:13:56,080
Take this off

612
00:13:56,580 --> 00:14:00,220
Matsumoto's challenge

613
00:13:56,580 --> 00:14:00,220
Matsumoto's challenge

614
00:13:56,760 --> 00:13:58,120
Move closer

615
00:13:58,440 --> 00:14:00,620
This is scary

616
00:13:58,780 --> 00:14:00,620
Get your hands inside it

617
00:14:02,380 --> 00:14:04,880
This looks pretty scary

618
00:14:02,960 --> 00:14:04,880
Is this gonna be ok, cap?

619
00:14:05,180 --> 00:14:07,250
I'm scared, captain

620
00:14:05,180 --> 00:14:07,250
Ready?

621
00:14:07,250 --> 00:14:09,320
I'll be the ghost, I'm going to run you over

622
00:14:09,320 --> 00:14:10,960
I'll be the ghost, I'm going to run you over

623
00:14:10,960 --> 00:14:12,280
What? Really?

624
00:14:12,500 --> 00:14:13,500
Get ready

625
00:14:12,500 --> 00:14:13,500
Yes

626
00:14:13,760 --> 00:14:15,400
Captain?

627
00:14:14,240 --> 00:14:15,400
Captain!

628
00:14:16,550 --> 00:14:17,940
So far...

629
00:14:16,980 --> 00:14:19,060
He's running around so much

630
00:14:17,940 --> 00:14:19,060
Yeah

631
00:14:19,580 --> 00:14:20,860
Here I come

632
00:14:20,860 --> 00:14:21,560
This is...

633
00:14:21,560 --> 00:14:22,560
It's dangerous

634
00:14:22,560 --> 00:14:23,700
Place your hands inside

635
00:14:23,700 --> 00:14:25,000
It's not safe

636
00:14:26,700 --> 00:14:27,740
Oh shit!

637
00:14:27,740 --> 00:14:30,300
He shouted so much!

638
00:14:29,080 --> 00:14:31,980
You can't shout, you're gonna get slapped

639
00:14:30,300 --> 00:14:31,980
But it's so scary

640
00:14:34,180 --> 00:14:36,520
I told you not to shout

641
00:14:34,920 --> 00:14:36,520
I'm sorry

642
00:14:36,520 --> 00:14:37,280
A middle aged man got down his bycicle and slapped you

643
00:14:37,280 --> 00:14:39,020
A middle aged man got down his bycicle and slapped you

644
00:14:39,020 --> 00:14:40,750
Weren't we talking about ghosts?

645
00:14:39,760 --> 00:14:40,750
A man?

646
00:14:41,250 --> 00:14:44,920
Matsumoto's 2nd challenge

647
00:14:41,250 --> 00:14:44,920
Matsumoto's 2nd challenge

648
00:14:41,760 --> 00:14:44,320
This is the scariest one yet

649
00:14:42,260 --> 00:14:44,320
Watch out, it's dangerous

650
00:14:44,320 --> 00:14:46,720
Really, what is he planning to do?

651
00:14:46,060 --> 00:14:47,260
I wonder

652
00:14:46,720 --> 00:14:49,720
Is he really going to run him over?

653
00:14:47,260 --> 00:14:49,720
Yeah, I don't know

654
00:14:50,180 --> 00:14:51,120
Looks like it

655
00:14:54,520 --> 00:14:55,740
Wait--

656
00:14:56,520 --> 00:14:57,620
Ouch

657
00:14:57,620 --> 00:14:59,280
So goddamn noisy!

658
00:14:59,280 --> 00:15:01,560
But I'm really freaking out, captain

659
00:15:01,560 --> 00:15:03,140
What's with the apologies?

660
00:15:03,140 --> 00:15:04,020
I'm sorry

661
00:15:04,320 --> 00:15:06,320
I told you not to speak, didn't I?

662
00:15:05,380 --> 00:15:06,320
I know, I'm sorry

663
00:15:06,820 --> 00:15:09,750
Matsumoto's 3rd challenge

664
00:15:06,820 --> 00:15:09,750
Matsumoto's 3rd challenge

665
00:15:07,380 --> 00:15:08,520
How can one do this?

666
00:15:08,520 --> 00:15:11,520
It's the unsafest thing

667
00:15:08,940 --> 00:15:11,520
Really, be careful there

668
00:15:12,820 --> 00:15:13,880
Captain?

669
00:15:20,720 --> 00:15:23,150
Oh shut up, so noisy

670
00:15:26,420 --> 00:15:28,170
I'm sorry

671
00:15:26,420 --> 00:15:28,170
You suck

672
00:15:28,320 --> 00:15:30,400
Such a noisy prick

673
00:15:30,400 --> 00:15:32,200
I was afraid, cap

674
00:15:32,200 --> 00:15:33,920
Sorry

675
00:15:32,200 --> 00:15:33,920
They're gonna eat you

676
00:15:33,920 --> 00:15:35,180
I'm really sorry

677
00:15:35,180 --> 00:15:37,920
Are you gonna be that frightened against ghosts?

678
00:15:37,920 --> 00:15:38,860
Yes

679
00:15:39,820 --> 00:15:41,020
Tanaka

680
00:15:41,240 --> 00:15:42,220
Your turn

681
00:15:42,780 --> 00:15:43,920
Do it

682
00:15:44,420 --> 00:15:45,900
This time I'll run

683
00:15:44,420 --> 00:15:47,820
Tanaka's challenge

684
00:15:44,420 --> 00:15:47,820
Tanaka's challenge

685
00:15:45,900 --> 00:15:47,460
Eh? Wait a sec--

686
00:15:47,460 --> 00:15:48,980
What do you mean?

687
00:15:48,980 --> 00:15:50,340
I'll be the ghost

688
00:15:50,340 --> 00:15:51,850
I see

689
00:15:51,040 --> 00:15:51,850
Think of me as one

690
00:15:51,850 --> 00:15:53,080
It's not like they only ride bicycles

691
00:15:53,080 --> 00:15:53,950
I see

692
00:15:53,950 --> 00:15:55,800
Move here a bit

693
00:15:54,700 --> 00:15:55,800
Sure

694
00:15:56,850 --> 00:15:58,740
In which spot are you going to run?

695
00:15:57,620 --> 00:15:58,740
I'm just running

696
00:15:58,740 --> 00:15:59,800
Yeah but, where?

697
00:15:59,800 --> 00:16:00,560
Where?

698
00:16:00,560 --> 00:16:01,880
How should I know this?!

699
00:16:01,880 --> 00:16:05,980
You think a ghost is gonna tell you where? Idiot

700
00:16:02,240 --> 00:16:03,380
Yeah but--

701
00:16:03,580 --> 00:16:04,480
Yes?

702
00:16:05,980 --> 00:16:07,020
Wait...

703
00:16:07,020 --> 00:16:07,820
Are you dumb?

704
00:16:07,820 --> 00:16:10,180
It's not like---

705
00:16:08,240 --> 00:16:10,180
Alright alright, I got it

706
00:16:10,180 --> 00:16:12,340
But I'm not mentally ready for this...

707
00:16:12,340 --> 00:16:13,420
I'm not... I'm sorry

708
00:16:13,420 --> 00:16:17,240
You think you can say that in your situation?

709
00:16:17,340 --> 00:16:17,880
I don't

710
00:16:17,880 --> 00:16:20,480
Remember that time we were together in the backstage?

711
00:16:19,180 --> 00:16:20,480
Yes?

712
00:16:20,480 --> 00:16:23,450
You told me "please teach me anything about comedy"

713
00:16:23,680 --> 00:16:24,160
Yes

714
00:16:24,160 --> 00:16:26,520
It was back then

715
00:16:24,920 --> 00:16:26,520
And that time you told me...

716
00:16:26,520 --> 00:16:27,850
"Don't ask me anything comedy-related", don't you remember?

717
00:16:27,850 --> 00:16:30,880
"Don't ask me anything comedy-related", don't you remember?

718
00:16:31,220 --> 00:16:32,280
I haven't forgotten that

719
00:16:32,550 --> 00:16:34,020
You said I sucked so bad at R-1's second round, am I right?

720
00:16:34,020 --> 00:16:34,550
You said I sucked so bad at R-1's second round, am I right?

721
00:16:34,550 --> 00:16:35,320
You said I sucked so bad at R-1's second round, am I right?

722
00:16:35,320 --> 00:16:38,320
You said I sucked so bad at R-1's second round, am I right?

723
00:16:38,320 --> 00:16:39,180
Am I?

724
00:16:38,320 --> 00:16:39,940
Did you say that?

725
00:16:39,180 --> 00:16:40,500
That's not true

726
00:16:39,940 --> 00:16:42,350
Don't you remember that?

727
00:16:42,350 --> 00:16:43,180
I should have cut ties with you that time, you idiot

728
00:16:43,180 --> 00:16:45,320
I should have cut ties with you that time, you idiot

729
00:16:45,320 --> 00:16:48,240
There he goes

730
00:16:45,980 --> 00:16:48,240
It's beginning

731
00:16:48,240 --> 00:16:48,920
I'm coming

732
00:16:48,920 --> 00:16:50,400
Why are we doing this?

733
00:16:48,920 --> 00:16:50,400
Yes, yes!

734
00:16:52,700 --> 00:16:55,640
You just said something, didn't you?

735
00:16:54,440 --> 00:16:55,640
Ouch

736
00:16:56,260 --> 00:16:58,380
Get those glasses off, you shithead

737
00:16:59,140 --> 00:16:59,900
Sorry

738
00:16:59,140 --> 00:17:01,750
You're all no good, let's quit this

739
00:16:59,900 --> 00:17:01,750
I'm really sorry

Presence of mind training

743
00:17:02,620 --> 00:17:06,740
Ghosts hate it when they're being laughed at

744
00:17:06,740 --> 00:17:09,750
Therefore it's important to train your mind presence

745
00:17:10,400 --> 00:17:11,620
Mind presence training now

746
00:17:11,620 --> 00:17:14,140
You won't ever be able to pass it

747
00:17:14,140 --> 00:17:16,400
If you shout for every minor thing

748
00:17:16,400 --> 00:17:17,460
Got it

749
00:17:17,760 --> 00:17:20,080
On the other hand, if you shout too much

750
00:17:20,460 --> 00:17:22,630
The ghosts are gonna stab you harder

751
00:17:23,100 --> 00:17:25,360
Are they going to?

752
00:17:23,100 --> 00:17:25,360
More than stabbing

753
00:17:25,360 --> 00:17:27,080
Let's just say they'll get mad

754
00:17:33,060 --> 00:17:34,220
Actually...

755
00:17:34,220 --> 00:17:36,150
When I used to work at the office,
they told us to bring a pic from our childhood

756

When I used to work at the office,
they told us to bring a pic from our childhood

757
00:17:39,040 --> 00:17:40,480
When they told me that

758
00:17:40,480 --> 00:17:41,350
I've brought this with me, it's the only one I have

759
00:17:41,350 --> 00:17:42,820
I've brought this with me, it's the only one I have

760

This is my mom, Murakami Kasumi

762
00:17:46,000 --> 00:17:48,450
And this one is Murakami Keiji

763
00:17:46,950 --> 00:17:48,450
Keiji

764
00:17:49,120 --> 00:17:50,920
It's not Shoji, he's my big brother

765
00:17:50,920 --> 00:17:53,520
It's not Shoji, he's my big brother

766
00:17:53,520 --> 00:17:56,100
But I always chose this picture

767
00:17:56,100 --> 00:17:58,480
'Cause I didn't want them to know I was poor

768
00:17:58,480 --> 00:17:59,780
I told them "I have this one pic here" pretending it was me

769
00:17:59,780 --> 00:18:01,580
I told them "I have this one pic here" pretending it was me

770
00:18:01,580 --> 00:18:03,750
I've always chosen this pic

771
00:18:06,520 --> 00:18:09,720
Dad - Naoyoshi

772
00:18:06,780 --> 00:18:07,840
My dad

773
00:18:08,140 --> 00:18:09,720
Murakami Naoyoshi

774
00:18:10,180 --> 00:18:11,260
This one

775
00:18:11,680 --> 00:18:12,880
Does he ring any bell?

776
00:18:14,180 --> 00:18:17,050
It's Keiji (big brother)

777
00:18:17,720 --> 00:18:19,320
He grew up a bit here

778
00:18:20,150 --> 00:18:21,660
He never shows up in photos...

779
00:18:21,660 --> 00:18:22,880
What the-

780
00:18:23,920 --> 00:18:25,620
Got you waiting enough

781
00:18:25,620 --> 00:18:29,500
This time there's also a relative of mine

782
00:18:29,640 --> 00:18:30,860
So...

783
00:18:30,860 --> 00:18:32,360
Remember this guy?

784
00:18:33,620 --> 00:18:34,780
He already appeared

785
00:18:34,860 --> 00:18:35,520
It's him

786
00:18:35,520 --> 00:18:37,350
Keiji

787
00:18:35,940 --> 00:18:37,350
It's Keiji

788
00:18:37,350 --> 00:18:38,350
Murakami Keiji

789
00:18:38,350 --> 00:18:39,680
This one

790
00:18:39,900 --> 00:18:41,160
Ah, your relative?

791
00:18:40,220 --> 00:18:41,160
It's this girl

792
00:18:41,160 --> 00:18:42,420
That's right

793
00:18:43,180 --> 00:18:45,900
And finally, this is me

794
00:18:44,550 --> 00:18:47,050
Murakami Shoji

795
00:18:46,440 --> 00:18:47,600
We have a pic

796
00:18:49,520 --> 00:18:52,500
You can tell by the background, right? We weren't rich---

797
00:18:50,950 --> 00:18:54,080
Yaa～wn!

798
00:18:56,480 --> 00:18:57,520
Are you really going to yawn over my explanation?!

799
00:18:57,520 --> 00:18:59,480
Are you really going to yawn over my explanation?!

800
00:18:59,480 --> 00:19:00,650
What the hell!

801
00:19:00,650 --> 00:19:03,460
It was perfectly timed just now

802
00:19:03,460 --> 00:19:05,960
Right when he's talking about himself

803
00:19:03,920 --> 00:19:08,680
It's time for an unexpected training!!

804
00:19:03,920 --> 00:19:08,680
It's time for an unexpected training!!

805
00:19:03,920 --> 00:19:08,680
coming next

806
00:19:03,920 --> 00:19:08,680
coming next

807
00:19:04,400 --> 00:19:05,960
That's not polite

808
00:19:05,960 --> 00:19:07,680
Yawning around

809
00:19:09,080 --> 00:19:10,680
Follow me

810
00:19:11,460 --> 00:19:12,560
Listen

811
00:19:14,800 --> 00:19:15,780
Here

812
00:19:15,980 --> 00:19:17,050
Matsumoto, start from here and do a long jump

813
00:19:16,540 --> 00:19:17,260
Yes

814
00:19:17,050 --> 00:19:18,680
Matsumoto, start from here and do a long jump

815
00:19:18,680 --> 00:19:19,820
Matsumoto, start from here and do a long jump

816
00:19:19,820 --> 00:19:21,700
...A long jump?  Behind the line, ok?

817
00:19:21,700 --> 00:19:22,550
Got it?

818
00:19:22,700 --> 00:19:24,040
What should I do?

819
00:19:24,240 --> 00:19:26,440
Like this?

820
00:19:24,750 --> 00:19:26,440
Ohh, right here

821
00:19:26,440 --> 00:19:27,340
Yes

822
00:19:27,340 --> 00:19:28,160
Here

823
00:19:28,160 --> 00:19:29,020
Tanaka

824
00:19:28,160 --> 00:19:30,060
What's this about?

825
00:19:29,020 --> 00:19:30,060
Yes

826
00:19:31,520 --> 00:19:34,020
Oh! That's impressive

827
00:19:32,080 --> 00:19:32,920
Incredible

828
00:19:32,920 --> 00:19:34,020
He's tall after all

829
00:19:34,020 --> 00:19:35,320
Ever took part in the athletics?

830
00:19:35,320 --> 00:19:36,120
No, not actually

831
00:19:36,120 --> 00:19:38,780
What's the point of this training?

832
00:19:36,520 --> 00:19:37,840
Even more impressive, then

833
00:19:37,840 --> 00:19:38,780
Alright, Endo

834
00:19:39,000 --> 00:19:40,920
It's your turn, Endo

835
00:19:39,000 --> 00:19:40,920
Yes

836
00:19:42,640 --> 00:19:44,970
I think he lost to Tanaka

837
00:19:42,640 --> 00:19:44,970
Uh! That's nice

838
00:19:45,100 --> 00:19:46,440
Right here

839
00:19:45,480 --> 00:19:46,440
Oh, ok

840
00:19:46,660 --> 00:19:48,330
Ok, Yamazaki

841
00:19:50,840 --> 00:19:52,280
Not bad at all

842
00:19:51,520 --> 00:19:53,120
He made it

843
00:19:52,280 --> 00:19:54,320
A tiny bit behind Endo's

844
00:19:53,520 --> 00:19:54,320
Yeah

845
00:19:54,320 --> 00:19:55,550
Your turn now

846
00:19:55,550 --> 00:19:56,220
Sorry captain, can I ask you what's the point of this?

847
00:19:56,220 --> 00:19:58,040
Sorry captain, can I ask you what's the point of this?

848
00:19:58,040 --> 00:19:58,920
Eh?

849
00:20:00,160 --> 00:20:01,260
What was that?

850
00:20:02,420 --> 00:20:04,460
"What's the point"? Is that what you asked?

851
00:20:04,460 --> 00:20:08,480
I mean... we should fight ghosts...

852
00:20:09,520 --> 00:20:12,140
'Cause the episode would be too short otherwise

853
00:20:12,140 --> 00:20:13,320
What?!

854
00:20:14,150 --> 00:20:17,780
So, this has nothing to do with ghosts?

855
00:20:15,350 --> 00:20:17,780
Of course it doesn't!

856
00:20:18,700 --> 00:20:20,600
You should have known this

857
00:20:19,280 --> 00:20:20,600
Yes, we're sorry

858
00:20:20,600 --> 00:20:22,220
We're really sorry

859
00:20:20,940 --> 00:20:22,220
We'll do our best

860
00:20:22,220 --> 00:20:25,080
You know there's so much stuff from golden hour to midnight

861
00:20:24,120 --> 00:20:25,080
Yes, sorry

862
00:20:25,450 --> 00:20:28,020
Bear that in mind!

863
00:20:28,520 --> 00:20:29,150
Be like "ohh right, maybe it's not enough yeah? Mhh" ya know?

864
00:20:29,150 --> 00:20:30,620
Be like "ohh right, maybe it's not enough yeah? Mhh" ya know?

865
00:20:30,620 --> 00:20:34,580
Be like "ohh right, maybe it's not enough yeah? Mhh" ya know?

866
00:20:35,340 --> 00:20:36,380
With that being said

867
00:20:36,380 --> 00:20:37,780
Let's do our last thing

868
00:20:38,020 --> 00:20:45,550
Ghostbusters Collector's Edition

869
00:20:38,020 --> 00:20:45,550
Ghostbusters classroom, lesson 5

870
00:20:38,020 --> 00:20:45,550
Marshmallow man's counterattack

871
00:20:38,860 --> 00:20:42,860
Now we'll get to see what they've learned today

872
00:20:42,860 --> 00:20:45,780
By fighting the strongest ghost, Marshmallow man

873
00:20:46,100 --> 00:20:48,780
If you get rid of Marshmol---mallow man

874
00:20:49,800 --> 00:20:51,520
You'll save the world

875
00:20:51,520 --> 00:20:52,680
Yes

876
00:20:51,860 --> 00:20:52,680
Got it?

877
00:20:52,680 --> 00:20:56,050
Now we'll get to decide which one of us is gonna be him

878
00:20:56,780 --> 00:20:58,550
By majority vote

879
00:20:59,460 --> 00:21:01,280
Ok

880
00:20:59,780 --> 00:21:01,280
That's how we'll decide it

881
00:21:01,540 --> 00:21:04,280
Rock-paper-scissors is no good, you can cheat

882
00:21:05,040 --> 00:21:08,330
Alright, raise your hand if you want

883
00:21:08,850 --> 00:21:11,320
Yamazaki to be Marshmallow man

884
00:21:11,860 --> 00:21:13,440
Who votes for Yamazaki?

885
00:21:14,700 --> 00:21:15,700
Anyone?

886
00:21:16,450 --> 00:21:18,150
Who wants Tanaka to be him?

887
00:21:19,900 --> 00:21:21,150
No one?

888
00:21:21,620 --> 00:21:22,620
Then...

889
00:21:22,620 --> 00:21:24,550
How about Endo?

890
00:21:26,380 --> 00:21:27,550
No one...

891
00:21:28,950 --> 00:21:29,820
Hamada

892
00:21:29,820 --> 00:21:32,450
Here!

893
00:21:32,450 --> 00:21:33,430
Me!

894
00:21:34,920 --> 00:21:35,380
Hamada got one vote out of five

895
00:21:35,380 --> 00:21:37,520
Hamada got one vote out of five

896
00:21:35,960 --> 00:21:37,260
He's in the lead

897
00:21:37,260 --> 00:21:38,480
One vote

898
00:21:37,520 --> 00:21:38,480
Hamada-kun!

899
00:21:38,620 --> 00:21:40,020
You have one vote now

900
00:21:39,360 --> 00:21:40,020
Yes

901
00:21:40,020 --> 00:21:41,350
One point for you

902
00:21:41,620 --> 00:21:43,420
Matsumoto

903
00:21:44,820 --> 00:21:46,420
No one, huh?

904
00:21:47,550 --> 00:21:49,250
Alright then, last one... Murakami

905
00:21:49,250 --> 00:21:50,380
Alright then, last one... Murakami

906
00:21:50,580 --> 00:21:51,660
Here!

907
00:21:51,150 --> 00:21:53,250
Achoo

908
00:21:56,040 --> 00:21:58,420
The fuck was that sneeze?!

909
00:21:57,300 --> 00:21:58,420
I'm sorry

910
00:21:58,420 --> 00:22:00,160
That was unacceptable, captain

911
00:22:00,160 --> 00:22:01,240
I know

912
00:22:00,160 --> 00:22:01,240
I'm sorry

913
00:22:01,240 --> 00:22:03,120
It didn't look like you were about to

914
00:22:02,380 --> 00:22:03,120
I'm sorry

915
00:22:03,120 --> 00:22:04,200
That's no good

916
00:22:03,600 --> 00:22:04,200
Forgive me

917
00:22:04,200 --> 00:22:05,950
And as soon as I said my name...

918
00:22:05,950 --> 00:22:06,520
You think I'm gonna lose to your sneeze, you idiot?!

919
00:22:06,520 --> 00:22:09,080
You think I'm gonna lose to your sneeze, you idiot?!

920
00:22:09,080 --> 00:22:11,440
Please do it

921
00:22:09,760 --> 00:22:11,440
Counting on you

922
00:22:11,680 --> 00:22:12,080
Can't help it, after all I made myself a nominee

923
00:22:12,080 --> 00:22:13,580
Can't help it, after all I made myself a nominee

924
00:22:13,580 --> 00:22:14,820
Yes

925
00:22:14,820 --> 00:22:15,780
Mh

926
00:22:16,000 --> 00:22:18,400
Alright, I'm getting changed

927
00:22:16,580 --> 00:22:18,400
You'll be Marshmallow man, captain

928
00:22:18,400 --> 00:22:21,120
Are you gonna become it?

929
00:22:20,220 --> 00:22:21,120
We'll wait

930
00:22:21,120 --> 00:22:22,350
Thanks

931
00:22:22,450 --> 00:22:26,550
Marshmallow man's counter-attack!!

932
00:22:22,450 --> 00:22:26,550
Marshmallow man's counter-attack!!

933
00:22:22,450 --> 00:22:26,550
coming next

934
00:22:22,450 --> 00:22:26,550
coming next

935
00:22:22,540 --> 00:22:24,620
It should be him

936
00:22:35,960 --> 00:22:37,180
It's Marshmallow man

937
00:22:37,700 --> 00:22:38,860
Looks strong

938
00:22:42,380 --> 00:22:43,950
I'm Marshmallow man!

939
00:22:43,950 --> 00:22:46,540
He even said it himself

940
00:22:46,540 --> 00:22:47,500
It's speaking

941
00:22:47,500 --> 00:22:48,740
Listen to me

942
00:22:48,740 --> 00:22:50,380
You gotta shoot me now

943
00:22:50,380 --> 00:22:51,220
Ok

944
00:22:51,220 --> 00:22:52,880
If you don't shoot me until I melt, I'm going to attack you

945
00:22:52,880 --> 00:22:53,880
If you don't shoot me until I melt, I'm going to attack you

946
00:22:53,880 --> 00:22:55,980
If you don't shoot me until I melt, I'm going to attack you

947
00:22:56,100 --> 00:22:56,920
Got it?

948
00:22:56,920 --> 00:22:58,280
Captain?

949
00:22:56,920 --> 00:22:58,280
Now, get ready

950
00:22:58,280 --> 00:22:59,320
