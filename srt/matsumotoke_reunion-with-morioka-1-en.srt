7
00:00:15,630 --> 00:00:18,170
What do you mean?

8
00:00:18,170 --> 00:00:21,500
We've arrived

9
00:00:18,170 --> 00:00:21,500
Well then, Here we are in Kyobashi

10
00:00:21,500 --> 00:00:23,440
Grand Chateaux from here on?

11
00:00:21,500 --> 00:00:23,440
What are you on about?

12
00:00:23,440 --> 00:00:26,910
Here in Kyobashi

13
00:00:23,440 --> 00:00:26,910
That's right

14
00:00:26,910 --> 00:00:28,940
My memories am I right?

15
00:00:26,910 --> 00:00:28,940
the memories are...

16
00:00:28,940 --> 00:00:31,380
Kyobashi...

17
00:00:28,940 --> 00:00:31,380
Yeah that's right

18
00:00:31,380 --> 00:00:36,050
So in the next place we're going to

19
00:00:31,380 --> 00:00:36,050
there's a former partner of yours waiting

20
00:00:36,050 --> 00:00:37,950
What?

21
00:00:39,090 --> 00:00:44,060
Mom's former acquaintance

22
00:00:44,360 --> 00:00:46,730
When I hear former partner

23
00:00:44,360 --> 00:00:46,730
former partner?

24
00:00:46,730 --> 00:00:50,030
Hamada, ya know?

25
00:00:46,730 --> 00:00:50,030
I naturally think, there's no other than

26
00:00:50,030 --> 00:00:51,700
Huh?

27
00:00:50,030 --> 00:00:51,700
Oh really?

28
00:00:51,700 --> 00:00:57,310
So there's nothing that rings a bell

29
00:00:51,700 --> 00:00:57,310
from ages ago when you did Manzai?

30
00:00:57,310 --> 00:01:01,880
So maybe from my student years?

31
00:00:57,310 --> 00:01:01,880
former partner though

32
00:01:01,880 --> 00:01:05,220
Like grade school

33
00:01:01,880 --> 00:01:05,220
There were definitely some there

34
00:01:05,220 --> 00:01:08,550
What kind of people did you

35
00:01:05,220 --> 00:01:08,550
hang out with then?

36
00:01:08,550 --> 00:01:11,560
Ito

37
00:01:08,550 --> 00:01:11,560
Well, Ito

38
00:01:11,560 --> 00:01:15,730
Ah ah I see, Morioka

39
00:01:11,560 --> 00:01:15,730
There were three of us with a guy "Morioka"

40
00:01:16,230 --> 00:01:21,770
Mom was actually in a trio in the old days

41
00:01:19,900 --> 00:01:25,240
And the name was... "The Koma third branch"

42
00:01:25,640 --> 00:01:30,010
Yeah so around 4th-5th grade

43
00:01:25,640 --> 00:01:30,010
of grade school

44
00:01:30,010 --> 00:01:31,910
Oh?

45
00:01:30,010 --> 00:01:31,910
Yeah..

46
00:01:32,140 --> 00:01:36,650
Mom started doing manzai in 4th grade of grade school

47
00:01:37,750 --> 00:01:40,320
So from what I've heard

48
00:01:37,750 --> 00:01:40,320
That would be before Hamada

49
00:01:40,320 --> 00:01:42,450
Yeah that's right

50
00:01:42,450 --> 00:01:45,520
I was with Ito quite a while but...

51
00:01:45,520 --> 00:01:50,800
Kyobashi and him

52
00:01:45,520 --> 00:01:50,800
definitely don't sound right together...

53
00:01:50,800 --> 00:01:53,470
There you go!

54
00:01:50,800 --> 00:01:53,470
Yes, It's actually someone from the Moriokas

55
00:01:55,740 --> 00:01:58,440
Morioka?

56
00:01:55,740 --> 00:01:58,440
Yes, Morioka

57
00:01:58,440 --> 00:02:00,740
That Morioka though, right?

58
00:02:01,710 --> 00:02:05,980
A partner before Hamada, Morioka

59
00:02:06,280 --> 00:02:10,950
But he didn't speak a word

60
00:02:06,280 --> 00:02:10,950
Ok so, we did have a trio together

61
00:02:12,290 --> 00:02:13,990
Seriously

62
00:02:12,290 --> 00:02:13,990
Then it's meaningless isn't it?

63
00:02:13,990 --> 00:02:17,890
First time he ever spoke was

64
00:02:13,990 --> 00:02:17,890
when he was about 7 years old...

65
00:02:17,890 --> 00:02:20,600
So it was kind of like

66
00:02:17,890 --> 00:02:20,600
the wolf girl?(Manga)

67
00:02:20,600 --> 00:02:22,600
So he didn't speak

68
00:02:20,600 --> 00:02:22,600
even though he was as old as 7?

69
00:02:22,600 --> 00:02:25,030
I'm absolutely serious, go ask the real person

70
00:02:22,600 --> 00:02:25,030
You serious?

71
00:02:25,030 --> 00:02:28,770
It's not just a matter of a couple of years

72
00:02:25,030 --> 00:02:28,770
So how many years has it been? Since you meet

73
00:02:28,770 --> 00:02:34,080
30?

74
00:02:28,770 --> 00:02:34,080
It must be more than 30 years now...

75
00:02:35,540 --> 00:02:40,980
After a time of 30 years, A reunion

76
00:02:40,980 --> 00:02:43,550
He's the eldest son of 6 siblings

77
00:02:40,980 --> 00:02:43,550
You know,

78
00:02:43,550 --> 00:02:47,090
6 siblings.. That's a remarkably large family

79
00:02:43,550 --> 00:02:47,090
Wow

80
00:02:47,090 --> 00:02:50,760
They were ridiculously poor

81
00:02:50,760 --> 00:02:55,770
I mean we were fairly poor too but

82
00:02:50,760 --> 00:02:55,770
that guy was completely beyond poor

83
00:02:55,770 --> 00:02:57,800
Are you serious?

84
00:02:57,800 --> 00:03:02,110
So that Morioka is now

85
00:02:57,800 --> 00:03:02,110
working somewhere in this vicinity?

86
00:03:02,110 --> 00:03:04,980
What kind of store do you think it is?

87
00:03:02,110 --> 00:03:04,980
Yes,

88
00:03:04,980 --> 00:03:10,080
Somehow, him doing something at a food

89
00:03:04,980 --> 00:03:10,080
and drink place sounds right to me

90
00:03:10,080 --> 00:03:12,920
In any case, because he was always...

91
00:03:12,920 --> 00:03:16,450
Because he was ALWAYS so hungry

92
00:03:17,090 --> 00:03:19,460
He could eat anytime

93
00:03:17,090 --> 00:03:19,460
That's why?

94
00:03:19,460 --> 00:03:22,590
So now that he's older, I feel like

95
00:03:19,460 --> 00:03:22,590
he would want to continue

96
00:03:22,590 --> 00:03:25,430
doing something

97
00:03:22,590 --> 00:03:25,430
with food that's very laidback like that

98
00:03:25,430 --> 00:03:27,600
You remember don'tcha?

99
00:03:27,600 --> 00:03:31,970
Anyhow, Morioka has

100
00:03:31,970 --> 00:03:35,910
for 12 years, independently been

101
00:03:31,970 --> 00:03:35,910
the owner of this here

102
00:03:35,910 --> 00:03:40,150
The owner boss

103
00:03:35,910 --> 00:03:40,150
Wow, that Morioka huh?

104
00:03:40,150 --> 00:03:42,980
Hang on a second, this is high class

105
00:03:40,150 --> 00:03:42,980
Here it is, "Kamon"

106
00:03:42,980 --> 00:03:45,420
Amazing

107
00:03:42,980 --> 00:03:45,420
Is that Morioka?

108
00:03:45,420 --> 00:03:47,320
Is that Morioka?

109
00:03:45,420 --> 00:03:47,320
You saw Morioka?

110
00:03:47,320 --> 00:03:49,520
Ah he's laughing

111
00:03:47,320 --> 00:03:49,520
Are you Morioka!?

112
00:03:49,520 --> 00:03:51,190
Haha, He's laughing

113
00:03:49,520 --> 00:03:51,190
We found Morioka

114
00:03:51,190 --> 00:03:53,360
We found Morioka

115
00:03:51,190 --> 00:03:53,360
Well let's get going then

116
00:03:53,360 --> 00:03:55,860
Hmm?

117
00:03:53,360 --> 00:03:55,860
Let's go

118
00:04:00,700 --> 00:04:03,170
You Morioka?

119
00:04:03,170 --> 00:04:05,140
Good evening

120
00:04:03,170 --> 00:04:05,140
It's freaking Morioka

121
00:04:05,140 --> 00:04:07,610
Good evening, nice to meet you

122
00:04:05,140 --> 00:04:07,610
Likewise

123
00:04:07,610 --> 00:04:09,940
Huh? Is this your wife?

124
00:04:07,610 --> 00:04:09,940
Yes

125
00:04:09,940 --> 00:04:12,310
Hello there, nice to meet you!

126
00:04:09,940 --> 00:04:12,310
Wow!

127
00:04:12,310 --> 00:04:14,350
I'm Matsumoto

128
00:04:14,350 --> 00:04:17,090
This is amazing...

129
00:04:14,350 --> 00:04:17,090
We totally get Morioka

130
00:04:17,090 --> 00:04:19,950
He looks so kind

131
00:04:17,090 --> 00:04:19,950
So, did he tell you

132
00:04:19,950 --> 00:04:22,120
Yes he did

133
00:04:19,950 --> 00:04:22,120
anything about me?

134
00:04:22,120 --> 00:04:25,390
He was talking crap about me right?

135
00:04:22,120 --> 00:04:25,390
What did he say?

136
00:04:25,390 --> 00:04:27,730
A little bit

137
00:04:27,730 --> 00:04:29,430
So he said something

138
00:04:29,430 --> 00:04:32,430
Yes

139
00:04:29,430 --> 00:04:32,430
You're the owner of this place right?

140
00:04:32,430 --> 00:04:34,340
He really is the owner though!

141
00:04:32,430 --> 00:04:34,340
More or less... yeah

142
00:04:34,340 --> 00:04:36,140
I mean, Morioka

143
00:04:34,340 --> 00:04:36,140
being the owner here

144
00:04:36,140 --> 00:04:38,570
The fact that we're having a

145
00:04:36,140 --> 00:04:38,570
a normal conversation is so surprising

146
00:04:38,570 --> 00:04:41,410
He seriously didn't speak a word

147
00:04:41,410 --> 00:04:45,150
That's right, He still doesn't

148
00:04:41,410 --> 00:04:45,150
talk to people he doesn't know

149
00:04:45,150 --> 00:04:48,520
Here's a little thing we heard from before

150
00:04:45,150 --> 00:04:48,520
Morioka,

151
00:04:48,520 --> 00:04:50,350
Up until you were 7 years old

152
00:04:48,520 --> 00:04:50,350
you didn't speak at all

153
00:04:50,350 --> 00:04:53,460
Is that true?

154
00:04:50,350 --> 00:04:53,460
You didn't speak at all right?

155
00:04:53,460 --> 00:04:57,390
That's saying too much...

156
00:04:53,460 --> 00:04:57,390
You were late with talking...

157
00:04:57,660 --> 00:05:01,570
So that's how it was

158
00:04:57,660 --> 00:05:01,570
The oldest of 6 siblings right?

159
00:05:01,570 --> 00:05:03,700
Huh? 7 people!?

160
00:05:01,570 --> 00:05:03,700
Seven actually...

161
00:05:03,700 --> 00:05:06,840
7 people? You increased to 7 huh?

162
00:05:06,840 --> 00:05:09,510
14 years younger..

163
00:05:06,840 --> 00:05:09,510
You got one more?

164
00:05:09,510 --> 00:05:11,410
That's just amazing

165
00:05:09,510 --> 00:05:11,410
Wow..

166
00:05:11,410 --> 00:05:14,480
Here's someone with a lot of legends

167
00:05:14,480 --> 00:05:17,480
He's a remarkable person

168
00:05:14,480 --> 00:05:17,480
Morioka...

169
00:05:17,480 --> 00:05:21,050
Haha, it's not like that..

170
00:05:17,480 --> 00:05:21,050
I'm going to enjoy listening to those

171
00:05:21,050 --> 00:05:23,060
Let's do that and calm down for a moment

172
00:05:21,050 --> 00:05:23,060
Let's sit down, shall we?

173
00:05:23,320 --> 00:05:36,570
A talk with the legendary former partner
Funny and exciting memories

174
00:05:25,120 --> 00:05:36,570
Chinese Cuisine:

175
00:05:25,120 --> 00:05:36,570
Kamon

176
00:05:36,900 --> 00:05:40,940
As expected, you wanted to manage a food place I see

177
00:05:36,900 --> 00:05:40,940
Cause you were constantly hungry

178
00:05:42,540 --> 00:05:44,240
Is that really true?

179
00:05:42,540 --> 00:05:44,240
Yes it is..

180
00:05:44,240 --> 00:05:48,880
In those days ya know

181
00:05:44,240 --> 00:05:48,880
Tanaka Kakuei was the prime minister

182
00:05:48,880 --> 00:05:50,550
Yeah yeah

183
00:05:49,150 --> 00:05:58,390
Mom: Matsumoto

184
00:05:49,150 --> 00:05:58,390
Morioka

185
00:05:50,550 --> 00:05:53,050
And I was taking my dog for a walk in the park

186
00:05:53,050 --> 00:05:54,720
And then, since Morioka

187
00:05:54,720 --> 00:05:56,360
lived adjacent to that park

188
00:05:56,360 --> 00:05:59,530
And from afar

189
00:05:59,530 --> 00:06:02,500
And their dad was SO poor

190
00:05:59,530 --> 00:06:02,500
and kind of hot headed

191
00:06:02,500 --> 00:06:04,970
I seriously heard this:

192
00:06:02,500 --> 00:06:04,970
So when I was walking the dog

193
00:06:04,970 --> 00:06:08,300
Tanaka, you freaking idiot!

194
00:06:09,440 --> 00:06:11,940
To the prime minister? The prime minister at the time?

195
00:06:11,940 --> 00:06:15,510
Yeah, Morioka's dad completely shaken

196
00:06:11,940 --> 00:06:15,510
let out a cry like that..

197
00:06:15,510 --> 00:06:18,150
Because they were so poor?

198
00:06:15,510 --> 00:06:18,150
Hahaha!

199
00:06:18,150 --> 00:06:21,080
Then my dog just went "ooooh"

200
00:06:21,080 --> 00:06:24,350
That was its response?

201
00:06:21,080 --> 00:06:24,350
That was the reaction?

202
00:06:24,350 --> 00:06:26,760
But right? It happened right?

203
00:06:26,760 --> 00:06:28,860
Hiroshi Morioka.

204
00:06:26,760 --> 00:06:28,860
His dad was called that.

205
00:06:28,860 --> 00:06:32,330
After that, we heard "Hiroshi, you fool!"

206
00:06:32,330 --> 00:06:35,230
From the two Itos and him

207
00:06:32,330 --> 00:06:35,230
Hiroshi, you fool

208
00:06:35,230 --> 00:06:37,230
Did they really

209
00:06:35,230 --> 00:06:37,230
say that?

210
00:06:37,230 --> 00:06:39,470
And then

211
00:06:37,230 --> 00:06:39,470
my dad got seriously angry

212
00:06:39,470 --> 00:06:43,910
Every time they saw his face

213
00:06:39,470 --> 00:06:43,910
His dad was really mad at us

214
00:06:43,910 --> 00:06:46,680
They uttered "Hiroshi, hiroshi"

215
00:06:46,680 --> 00:06:50,150
That sure is funny

216
00:06:46,680 --> 00:06:50,150
Yeah, His dad was kind of messed up

217
00:06:50,150 --> 00:06:52,050
Hiroshi Morioka

218
00:06:52,050 --> 00:06:55,920
He brought out a bunch of porn mags

219
00:06:52,050 --> 00:06:55,920
When we went to play at his house

220
00:06:55,920 --> 00:06:58,760
Huh? For you kids? But you were in grade school right?

221
00:06:55,920 --> 00:06:58,760
Yeah

222
00:06:58,760 --> 00:07:01,330
Yeah he just threw them on the table

223
00:06:58,760 --> 00:07:01,330
You were shown porn mags?

224
00:07:01,330 --> 00:07:05,260
He said I can't deal with these anymore

225
00:07:01,330 --> 00:07:05,260
I think it was during spring cleaning or something

226
00:07:05,260 --> 00:07:07,570
So he threw them in a bonfire

227
00:07:07,570 --> 00:07:13,140
"This one I don't need, this neither..."

228
00:07:07,570 --> 00:07:13,140
And we kids were looking at this

229
00:07:13,140 --> 00:07:16,280
Ah, I haven't finished watching this one yet

230
00:07:17,940 --> 00:07:20,580
What happened with him anyway?

231
00:07:20,580 --> 00:07:24,050
He's healthy...

232
00:07:20,580 --> 00:07:24,050
Huh!? He's still alive? Wow

233
00:07:24,950 --> 00:07:26,990
He's still well

234
00:07:24,950 --> 00:07:26,990
That idiot...

235
00:07:26,990 --> 00:07:29,060
Please stop

236
00:07:29,060 --> 00:07:30,960
Morioka's reaction

237
00:07:29,060 --> 00:07:30,960
Seriously?

238
00:07:30,960 --> 00:07:32,930
is as if he's dead

239
00:07:32,930 --> 00:07:34,960
I'm completely dead now

240
00:07:32,930 --> 00:07:34,960
My wife isn't saying anything so

241
00:07:34,960 --> 00:07:36,960
Like in an instant

242
00:07:34,960 --> 00:07:36,960
Right?

243
00:07:36,960 --> 00:07:39,700
I guess so, you're fully alive though..

244
00:07:36,960 --> 00:07:39,700
I wonder what happened for a moment there

245
00:07:39,700 --> 00:07:44,770
Saying "I wonder what happened for a moment"

246
00:07:39,700 --> 00:07:44,770
These are the things this boring ass

247
00:07:44,770 --> 00:07:47,140
is saying, after all

248
00:07:47,140 --> 00:07:49,180
Come on, you just met him after all this time

249
00:07:49,180 --> 00:07:51,880
35 years

250
00:07:49,180 --> 00:07:51,880
How long has it been?

251
00:07:51,880 --> 00:07:54,350
35 years huh, when exactly was the last time?

252
00:07:54,350 --> 00:07:58,350
At Osaka station..

253
00:07:54,350 --> 00:07:58,350
Oh we met?

254
00:07:58,350 --> 00:08:03,090
At that disgusting under passage right?

255
00:07:58,350 --> 00:08:03,090
Yeah, exactly

256
00:08:03,090 --> 00:08:07,300
The manzai contest... Imamiya

257
00:08:07,300 --> 00:08:10,670
Really?

258
00:08:07,300 --> 00:08:10,670
So kind of in the middle of that. On your way home

259
00:08:10,670 --> 00:08:14,500
And at that time

260
00:08:10,670 --> 00:08:14,500
Wow, we met at an amazing place then

261
00:08:14,500 --> 00:08:18,870
Your partner Hamada, cried out in a loud voice

262
00:08:18,870 --> 00:08:23,310
"Morioka!"... at like the grounds there...

263
00:08:23,310 --> 00:08:26,520
What are you saying? Who the hell is this?

264
00:08:23,310 --> 00:08:26,520
What in the world...

265
00:08:26,520 --> 00:08:31,520
Forget about that,

266
00:08:26,520 --> 00:08:31,520
He cried out your name and you didnt know what he was saying?

267
00:08:34,120 --> 00:08:36,560
When he saw Morioka

268
00:08:34,120 --> 00:08:36,560
that's what he had to say, in a whoosh

269
00:08:36,560 --> 00:08:38,560
Hamada's body just had to

270
00:08:38,560 --> 00:08:41,370
When he saw him

271
00:08:38,560 --> 00:08:41,370
his body just went Morioka!

272
00:08:41,370 --> 00:08:43,800
Anyhow, he's a super kind guy

273
00:08:43,800 --> 00:08:46,400
Aren't you?

274
00:08:43,800 --> 00:08:46,400
We totally understand that

275
00:08:46,400 --> 00:08:48,540
When you look at him, you understand

276
00:08:46,400 --> 00:08:48,540
Yeah

277
00:08:48,540 --> 00:08:52,040
He's never been angry right?

278
00:08:48,540 --> 00:08:52,040
Yeah, that's right

279
00:08:52,040 --> 00:08:55,480
A bit of a poor talker

280
00:08:52,040 --> 00:08:55,480
I can't imagine that

281
00:08:55,480 --> 00:08:57,120
But we understand

282
00:08:55,480 --> 00:08:57,120
Exactly

283
00:08:57,120 --> 00:08:58,780
He doesn't get that angry

284
00:08:58,780 --> 00:09:01,220
I kind of

285
00:08:58,780 --> 00:09:01,220
want to eat something Morioka has made

286
00:09:01,220 --> 00:09:03,990
Let's eat!

287
00:09:01,220 --> 00:09:03,990
So...

288
00:09:03,990 --> 00:09:07,230
First of all, what is it?

289
00:09:03,990 --> 00:09:07,230
How about your recommendation?

290
00:09:07,230 --> 00:09:11,000
Ah, there ya go, Mapo Tofu

291
00:09:07,230 --> 00:09:11,000
My recommendation would be Mapo Tofu

292
00:09:11,000 --> 00:09:17,240
I never thought I'd be eating Morioka's

293
00:09:11,000 --> 00:09:17,240
Mapo Tofu...

294
00:09:17,240 --> 00:09:21,210
I didn't think it would happen

295
00:09:17,240 --> 00:09:21,210
I've heard he worked his way up to be a head chef

296
00:09:21,210 --> 00:09:23,310
And then 12 years ago

297
00:09:21,210 --> 00:09:23,310
Wow..

298
00:09:23,310 --> 00:09:26,710
He became independent

299
00:09:23,310 --> 00:09:26,710
You worked hard didn't you...

300
00:09:26,710 --> 00:09:29,550
That's incredible

301
00:09:29,550 --> 00:09:32,890
It is, it is

302
00:09:29,550 --> 00:09:32,890
Yeah, it really is

303
00:09:32,890 --> 00:09:37,120
Is Yumi in good health?

304
00:09:32,890 --> 00:09:37,120
Is everybody..

305
00:09:37,120 --> 00:09:38,790
Yeah, everyone is...

306
00:09:38,790 --> 00:09:40,800
Well, his little sister

307
00:09:38,790 --> 00:09:40,800
Who is that? Yumi

308
00:09:40,800 --> 00:09:45,470
Everyone is healthy huh? That's amazing

309
00:09:40,800 --> 00:09:45,470
They are all well

310
00:09:45,470 --> 00:09:47,300
There's Yoshitaka, Yumi

311
00:09:47,300 --> 00:09:49,470
Ah, Kouji

312
00:09:47,300 --> 00:09:49,470
And Kouji

313
00:09:49,470 --> 00:09:51,140
Masako

314
00:09:49,470 --> 00:09:51,140
Masako

315
00:09:51,140 --> 00:09:52,770
Eiko

316
00:09:51,140 --> 00:09:52,770
Eiko

317
00:09:52,770 --> 00:09:54,480
Kazuo

318
00:09:52,770 --> 00:09:54,480
and Kazuo

319
00:09:54,480 --> 00:09:56,110
And then at the very end Yoshiyuki

320
00:09:54,480 --> 00:09:56,110
Yoshiyuki

321
00:09:56,110 --> 00:09:59,050
So maybe Kouji?

322
00:09:56,110 --> 00:09:59,050
Yoshiyuki...

323
00:09:59,050 --> 00:10:01,550
The third one

324
00:09:59,050 --> 00:10:01,550
Yeah the third one

325
00:10:01,550 --> 00:10:05,650
That dude

326
00:10:01,550 --> 00:10:05,650
was always taking persimmons!

327
00:10:05,650 --> 00:10:08,190
From the neighbourhood?

328
00:10:05,650 --> 00:10:08,190
Hahaha

329
00:10:08,190 --> 00:10:10,990
Cause ya didn't have anything to eat

330
00:10:08,190 --> 00:10:10,990
You know what,

331
00:10:10,990 --> 00:10:13,860
There was a persimmon tree

332
00:10:10,990 --> 00:10:13,860
next to the Dobu River

333
00:10:13,860 --> 00:10:18,000
And there, like the tree was

334
00:10:18,000 --> 00:10:21,000
It was too crooked?

335
00:10:18,000 --> 00:10:21,000
how should I say, bending down

336
00:10:21,000 --> 00:10:23,110
No no no, it was like...

337
00:10:23,110 --> 00:10:24,880
The tree was like in a complete arch,

338
00:10:23,110 --> 00:10:24,880
What do you call that?

339
00:10:24,880 --> 00:10:26,740
You couldn't really tell at first glance

340
00:10:26,740 --> 00:10:30,150
And then, Kouji was like holding on to the tree

341
00:10:26,740 --> 00:10:30,150
Whaaa!

342
00:10:30,150 --> 00:10:31,780
And as his back was almost

343
00:10:31,780 --> 00:10:35,790
He munched on the persimmons

344
00:10:31,780 --> 00:10:35,790
touching the river

345
00:10:35,950 --> 00:10:38,920
Like a bear! He was a bear!

346
00:10:38,920 --> 00:10:41,590
That's how bears eat

347
00:10:41,590 --> 00:10:44,460
Cause he was hungry

348
00:10:41,590 --> 00:10:44,460
Hah, because he was hungry?

349
00:10:44,460 --> 00:10:46,100
They didn't have a choice

350
00:10:46,100 --> 00:10:50,670
Have you met any

351
00:10:46,100 --> 00:10:50,670
other peeps from Amagasaki?

352
00:10:50,670 --> 00:10:53,610
Uhm...

353
00:10:53,610 --> 00:10:56,440
One time... uh... the guy from the meat shop

354
00:10:53,610 --> 00:10:56,440
Yamazato?

355
00:10:56,440 --> 00:11:02,410
I went to him one time when... uhm..

356
00:10:56,440 --> 00:11:02,410
they were closing

357
00:11:02,410 --> 00:11:06,420
And uh then...

358
00:11:02,410 --> 00:11:06,420
we went and kept them some company

359
00:11:08,520 --> 00:11:10,920
But after that,

360
00:11:08,520 --> 00:11:10,920
We had them all stay for dinner here

361
00:11:10,920 --> 00:11:12,930
Your talking is completely hopeless

362
00:11:13,960 --> 00:11:17,400
His talking is hopeless

363
00:11:13,960 --> 00:11:17,400
There's no mistaking there

364
00:11:17,400 --> 00:11:20,200
You know, It's because

365
00:11:17,400 --> 00:11:20,200
he didn't speak until he was 7

366
00:11:20,200 --> 00:11:23,840
Hahahaha

367
00:11:20,200 --> 00:11:23,840
You're strict, I'm just a common guy

368
00:11:23,840 --> 00:11:27,340
Hey!

369
00:11:23,840 --> 00:11:27,340
Ooooh!

370
00:11:27,340 --> 00:11:29,780
Mapo Tofu

371
00:11:27,340 --> 00:11:29,780
Wow!

372
00:11:29,780 --> 00:11:31,850
You can put some peppers on to your liking

373
00:11:31,850 --> 00:11:35,720
Eating Mapo Tofu that Morioka has made...

374
00:11:31,850 --> 00:11:35,720
Wow, this is amazing

375
00:11:35,720 --> 00:11:38,850
It's...

376
00:11:35,720 --> 00:11:38,850
Please eat up

377
00:11:38,850 --> 00:11:42,190
It looks delicious

378
00:11:38,850 --> 00:11:42,190
Wah, it really does

379
00:11:42,190 --> 00:11:46,290
This is really professional, Morioka

380
00:11:46,290 --> 00:11:48,700
Hmm?

381
00:11:46,290 --> 00:11:48,700
I've been trying hard to figure it out

382
00:11:48,700 --> 00:11:52,530
"Figured out" Mapo Tofu though

383
00:11:48,700 --> 00:11:52,530
You're not the one to have

384
00:11:52,670 --> 00:11:55,200
That's the chinese

385
00:11:55,200 --> 00:11:58,310
Ah, so that's what he meant

386
00:11:55,200 --> 00:11:58,310
The taste though, It's Morioka's take on it

387
00:11:58,310 --> 00:12:00,410
Digging in...

388
00:12:00,410 --> 00:12:02,450
Mmm!

389
00:12:04,980 --> 00:12:07,050
It's delicious!

390
00:12:04,980 --> 00:12:07,050
Thank you

391
00:12:07,050 --> 00:12:09,690
Wow, that's delish!

392
00:12:09,690 --> 00:12:12,920
It's delicious but

393
00:12:09,690 --> 00:12:12,920
also has a "originality" to it

394
00:12:12,920 --> 00:12:15,890
It's like different to

395
00:12:12,920 --> 00:12:15,890
Yummy!

396
00:12:15,890 --> 00:12:17,660
Way off

397
00:12:15,890 --> 00:12:17,660
normal Mapo Tofu

398
00:12:17,660 --> 00:12:20,530
He's saying that because he has worked hard

399
00:12:17,660 --> 00:12:20,530
It's completely different

400
00:12:20,530 --> 00:12:22,570
to figure out the perfect combination

401
00:12:22,570 --> 00:12:25,600
Isn't your wife's support a little sloppy?

402
00:12:25,600 --> 00:12:27,910
I especially praise his cooking

403
00:12:27,910 --> 00:12:29,540
huh, whats going on?

404
00:12:29,540 --> 00:12:31,510
At first the spicyness isn't so noticeable

405
00:12:31,510 --> 00:12:33,610
It's delicious, the sweetness

406
00:12:31,510 --> 00:12:33,610
What is this magic?

407
00:12:33,610 --> 00:12:35,480
It's delightful

408
00:12:33,610 --> 00:12:35,480
The sweetness is delightful

409
00:12:35,480 --> 00:12:37,520
And the peppers...

410
00:12:35,480 --> 00:12:37,520
If you put on some peppers

411
00:12:37,520 --> 00:12:39,550
The tang changes again

412
00:12:37,520 --> 00:12:39,550
Yes, exactly that

413
00:12:39,550 --> 00:12:41,590
This is freaking good

414
00:12:41,590 --> 00:12:45,260
It's good, the originality

415
00:12:41,590 --> 00:12:45,260
is really prominent

416
00:12:45,260 --> 00:12:47,530
Eat up everyone

417
00:12:47,530 --> 00:12:49,500
This really is good

418
00:12:49,500 --> 00:12:51,160
Shall we go for one more thing?

419
00:12:49,500 --> 00:12:51,160
Yeah?

420
00:12:51,160 --> 00:12:52,830
Yes

421
00:12:52,830 --> 00:12:56,400
It was called the "Koma third branch" right?

422
00:12:52,830 --> 00:12:56,400
Spinning top

423
00:12:52,830 --> 00:12:56,400
What was it now?

424
00:12:56,400 --> 00:12:59,140
So the third koma branch was

425
00:12:56,400 --> 00:12:59,140
Yes, that's right

426
00:12:59,140 --> 00:13:02,210
The manzai group

427
00:12:59,140 --> 00:13:02,210
the name of the trio, yeah

428
00:13:02,210 --> 00:13:04,680
Do you remember any sketches?

429
00:13:04,680 --> 00:13:07,850
I told you, he doesn't speak

430
00:13:09,220 --> 00:13:14,520
Anyway, Ito was...

431
00:13:09,220 --> 00:13:14,520
He was called the "Iron spin top"

432
00:13:13,190 --> 00:13:22,630
Iron top

433
00:13:14,520 --> 00:13:17,360
Iron, wood...

434
00:13:14,520 --> 00:13:17,360
and I was called the "wood spin top"

435
00:13:15,720 --> 00:13:22,630
Wood top

436
00:13:17,360 --> 00:13:19,490
Then naturally, Morioka was

437
00:13:19,490 --> 00:13:21,800
was called the "plastic spin top"

438
00:13:20,130 --> 00:13:22,630
Plastic top

439
00:13:21,800 --> 00:13:24,230
The most boring one

440
00:13:26,230 --> 00:13:28,040
The plastic spin top?

441
00:13:26,230 --> 00:13:28,040
The simple guy huh

442
00:13:28,040 --> 00:13:29,740
A simple guy

443
00:13:29,040 --> 00:13:33,210
Iron top

444
00:13:29,040 --> 00:13:33,210
Plastic top

445
00:13:29,040 --> 00:13:33,210
Wood top

446
00:13:29,740 --> 00:13:31,370
Such an unimportant guy

447
00:13:29,740 --> 00:13:31,370
The cheap one

448
00:13:31,370 --> 00:13:33,710
Haha, That's right

449
00:13:33,710 --> 00:13:36,080
The wife is laughing like crazy

450
00:13:37,950 --> 00:13:40,880
We had like songs too right?

451
00:13:40,880 --> 00:13:42,550
However...

452
00:13:40,880 --> 00:13:42,550
Songs?

453
00:13:42,550 --> 00:13:44,750
The song of the "Spin top third division"

454
00:13:44,750 --> 00:13:49,660
You don't remember? You cold hearted jerk

455
00:13:49,660 --> 00:13:52,600
and iron is always smiling♬

456
00:13:49,660 --> 00:13:52,600
♬The wood top is so kind

457
00:13:55,330 --> 00:14:00,740
♬And the plastic top is so poor♬

458
00:14:00,740 --> 00:14:02,270
Hahahaha!

459
00:14:02,270 --> 00:14:05,840
Am I right? Morioka, you must remember

460
00:14:02,270 --> 00:14:05,840
Hearing it now,

461
00:14:05,840 --> 00:14:09,710
But I can't say I remember anything

462
00:14:05,840 --> 00:14:09,710
I remembered a little bit

463
00:14:09,710 --> 00:14:11,780
You sure do remember a lot

464
00:14:11,780 --> 00:14:14,750
How come is it

465
00:14:11,780 --> 00:14:14,750
that you, such a quiet guy

466
00:14:14,750 --> 00:14:17,220
joined Matsumoto's group?

467
00:14:17,220 --> 00:14:21,530
It was always us 3 together...

468
00:14:17,220 --> 00:14:21,530
Through grade and middle school

469
00:14:21,530 --> 00:14:23,460
Yeah we were somehow together

470
00:14:23,460 --> 00:14:26,730
And we often went to Ito's

471
00:14:23,460 --> 00:14:26,730
house and play...

472
00:14:26,730 --> 00:14:30,440
Listen, Morioka was not a guy who

473
00:14:26,730 --> 00:14:30,440
shared his feelings a lot

474
00:14:30,440 --> 00:14:34,540
So you were tagging along, right?

475
00:14:30,440 --> 00:14:34,540
Uhm...

476
00:14:34,540 --> 00:14:37,940
Lonely?

477
00:14:34,540 --> 00:14:37,940
Well, I was lonely so...

478
00:14:37,940 --> 00:14:41,750
I'm gonna cry

479
00:14:37,940 --> 00:14:41,750
Tears might be coming out at any moment

480
00:14:41,750 --> 00:14:45,580
Well regarding that...

481
00:14:41,750 --> 00:14:45,580
What's up with that? Suddenly...

482
00:14:45,580 --> 00:14:48,350
Us 3 did manzai quite often

483
00:14:48,350 --> 00:14:51,060
Where did you guys perform manzai?

484
00:14:48,350 --> 00:14:51,060
and we were killing it too

485
00:14:51,060 --> 00:14:54,830
Well at like, christmas meetings

486
00:14:51,060 --> 00:14:54,830
and when there were other various assemblies

487
00:14:54,830 --> 00:14:59,930
and because we did manzai in our own special way

488
00:14:54,830 --> 00:14:59,930
we often killed it

489
00:14:59,930 --> 00:15:02,000
At times, me and Ito

490
00:15:02,000 --> 00:15:05,510
do we even need Morioka?

491
00:15:02,000 --> 00:15:05,510
were often thinking

492
00:15:05,510 --> 00:15:08,780
Because it was only the two of us who thought out the sketches

493
00:15:07,140 --> 00:15:17,050
Iron top

494
00:15:07,140 --> 00:15:17,050
Plastic top

495
00:15:07,140 --> 00:15:17,050
Wood top

496
00:15:08,780 --> 00:15:10,580
and sometimes only us two speaking

497
00:15:10,580 --> 00:15:12,710
So Morioka didn't do much

498
00:15:12,710 --> 00:15:14,820
and we thought let's do it without him then

499
00:15:14,820 --> 00:15:17,620
That one time we did it without him

500
00:15:17,620 --> 00:15:20,860
Wow!

501
00:15:17,620 --> 00:15:20,860
was a complete disaster, we bombed

502
00:15:20,860 --> 00:15:27,660
So at that time, we thought "We DO need him"

503
00:15:20,860 --> 00:15:27,660
With this type of "Morioka" being with us

504
00:15:27,660 --> 00:15:30,070
Ah, I see

505
00:15:27,660 --> 00:15:30,070
We figured out the balance

506
00:15:30,070 --> 00:15:33,870
It was very brash

507
00:15:30,070 --> 00:15:33,870
Me and Ito always wanted to mess around with each other

508
00:15:33,870 --> 00:15:37,440
I get it

509
00:15:33,870 --> 00:15:37,440
and we were just freaking wasting time

510
00:15:37,440 --> 00:15:41,310
Isn't noticing that in 4th grade

511
00:15:37,440 --> 00:15:41,310
amazing?

512
00:15:41,310 --> 00:15:43,350
Very harsh

513
00:15:41,310 --> 00:15:43,350
Yeah it is

514
00:15:43,350 --> 00:15:45,050
So Morioka made it important

515
00:15:43,350 --> 00:15:45,050
around that

516
00:15:45,050 --> 00:15:47,220
Because of the balance

517
00:15:45,050 --> 00:15:47,220
Yeah, exactly

518
00:15:47,220 --> 00:15:50,650
Wow, that's interesting

519
00:15:50,650 --> 00:15:52,960
If that didn't happen

520
00:15:50,650 --> 00:15:52,960
You probably wouldn't have made it would you

521
00:15:52,960 --> 00:15:56,060
Exactly, that you're right.

522
00:15:52,960 --> 00:15:56,060
Morioka, are you even listening?

523
00:15:56,060 --> 00:15:58,260
Yes sir, I'm listening

524
00:15:58,260 --> 00:16:01,700
"Yes sir"

525
00:15:58,260 --> 00:16:01,700
Why the hell are you being so polite?

526
00:16:02,130 --> 00:16:06,400
It's like you guys are brothers...

527
00:16:02,130 --> 00:16:06,400
Morioka is just...

528
00:16:07,870 --> 00:16:10,880
Classmates, right?

529
00:16:07,870 --> 00:16:10,880
It's because you're former partners

530
00:16:10,880 --> 00:16:13,180
Yeah he's a good guy though right?

531
00:16:13,180 --> 00:16:15,810
Right?

532
00:16:13,180 --> 00:16:15,810
Yes.. he is

533
00:16:15,810 --> 00:16:20,020
Hey, your wife is saying kind things about you

534
00:16:20,020 --> 00:16:26,190
I'm glad all siblings are alive and happy

535
00:16:26,190 --> 00:16:29,760
Absolutely

536
00:16:26,190 --> 00:16:29,760
It sure is good

537
00:16:29,760 --> 00:16:33,500
It's a little...

538
00:16:29,760 --> 00:16:33,500
What's up with this atmosphere?

539
00:16:33,500 --> 00:16:36,600
Anything you remember,

540
00:16:33,500 --> 00:16:36,600
Don't you have any memories of

541
00:16:36,600 --> 00:16:38,640
Matsumoto?

542
00:16:36,600 --> 00:16:38,640
Plenty of them

543
00:16:38,640 --> 00:16:42,070
Morioka, did you like me?

544
00:16:38,640 --> 00:16:42,070
Oh, that's a good one

545
00:16:42,070 --> 00:16:44,040
I liked you from the start...

546
00:16:42,070 --> 00:16:44,040
To begin with

547
00:16:44,040 --> 00:16:47,350
Really? I thought I was disliked though

548
00:16:47,350 --> 00:16:50,450
I don't think you remember but,

549
00:16:50,450 --> 00:16:53,820
When we were in kindergarden...

550
00:16:53,820 --> 00:16:58,090
Together yeah, and I had to hop off midstream

551
00:16:53,820 --> 00:16:58,090
Yeah we were in kindergarden together

552
00:16:58,090 --> 00:17:01,660
And then at the kindergarden's...

553
00:16:58,090 --> 00:17:01,660
He just said he had to hop off kindergarden,

554
00:17:01,660 --> 00:17:04,800
Completely cause of economic reasons..

555
00:17:01,660 --> 00:17:04,800
Isn't that amazing?

556
00:17:04,800 --> 00:17:06,770
Well I guess that's how it was

557
00:17:06,770 --> 00:17:11,240
Right, Morioka?

558
00:17:06,770 --> 00:17:11,240
So I quit midstream... and then I

559
00:17:11,240 --> 00:17:14,380
the school gate

560
00:17:11,240 --> 00:17:14,380
was always waiting outside

561
00:17:14,380 --> 00:17:19,780
And then,

562
00:17:14,380 --> 00:17:19,780
I heard macchan call for me

563
00:17:19,780 --> 00:17:22,180
And then..kind of..from there

564
00:17:24,920 --> 00:17:27,960
we started talking..

565
00:17:27,960 --> 00:17:30,530
Huh?

566
00:17:27,960 --> 00:17:30,530
That's the first

567
00:17:30,530 --> 00:17:32,760
I don't really get it but,

568
00:17:30,530 --> 00:17:32,760
You can call it the first time we started hanging out

569
00:17:32,760 --> 00:17:36,830
It feels like I'm starting to cry

570
00:17:32,760 --> 00:17:36,830
Makes you want to cry all of a sudden right?

571
00:17:36,830 --> 00:17:39,000
Oh, here it is!

572
00:17:39,000 --> 00:17:41,200
Wow, that looks amazing

573
00:17:41,200 --> 00:17:44,940
Right after the story; "Shhuuwaa"

574
00:17:44,940 --> 00:17:46,880
This looks so delicious!

575
00:17:46,880 --> 00:17:49,310
So you...

576
00:17:46,880 --> 00:17:49,310
You remember something like that?

577
00:17:49,310 --> 00:17:52,080
One doesn't really have many

578
00:17:49,310 --> 00:17:52,080
memories from kindergarden

579
00:17:52,080 --> 00:17:54,750
Was that the earliest memory you have?

580
00:17:54,750 --> 00:17:58,420
That voice, calling for me

581
00:17:54,750 --> 00:17:58,420
Yeah the earliest...

582
00:17:58,420 --> 00:18:02,430
Made me very happy...

583
00:17:58,420 --> 00:18:02,430
That's why I have no trouble remembering it now

584
00:18:02,430 --> 00:18:04,830
I think of it sometimes

585
00:18:02,430 --> 00:18:04,830
So that's how it is, I guess I did do that.

586
00:18:04,830 --> 00:18:06,900
You think of it sometimes?

587
00:18:06,900 --> 00:18:09,470
I guess I did that...

588
00:18:06,900 --> 00:18:09,470
Remarkable

589
00:18:09,470 --> 00:18:12,470
Calling out for me..

590
00:18:09,470 --> 00:18:12,470
What a great story

591
00:18:12,470 --> 00:18:16,370
Morioka might actually be

592
00:18:12,470 --> 00:18:16,370
my first ever friend

593
00:18:16,370 --> 00:18:19,110
Am i right?

594
00:18:19,110 --> 00:18:22,010
It was like that for him

595
00:18:19,110 --> 00:18:22,010
and same for me

596
00:18:22,010 --> 00:18:25,890
We were in the same class

597
00:18:22,010 --> 00:18:25,890
all the way from grade school to 6th grade so...

598
00:18:25,890 --> 00:18:28,750
It's unbelievable we were in the same class

599
00:18:25,890 --> 00:18:28,750
Yeah yeah yeah

600
00:18:28,750 --> 00:18:32,560
Me and Hamada never ended up in

601
00:18:28,750 --> 00:18:32,560
the same class. Not even once

602
00:18:32,560 --> 00:18:35,930
It was a wonder.

603
00:18:32,560 --> 00:18:35,930
There were only 3 classes you know

604
00:18:35,930 --> 00:18:38,300
Especially during 4th and 5th grade

605
00:18:35,930 --> 00:18:38,300
What an amazing story

606
00:18:38,300 --> 00:18:40,370
Exactly

607
00:18:38,300 --> 00:18:40,370
We became 2 classes right?

608
00:18:40,370 --> 00:18:42,570
Despite that,

609
00:18:40,370 --> 00:18:42,570
Me and Hamada didn't end up in the same one

610
00:18:42,570 --> 00:18:47,340
unfortunately. However, with Morioka

611
00:18:42,570 --> 00:18:47,340
we were ALWAYS together

612
00:18:47,340 --> 00:18:51,050
But if you add it all up

613
00:18:47,340 --> 00:18:51,050
we've probably talked for 20 minutes all together

614
00:18:51,050 --> 00:18:54,420
It must have been longer

615
00:18:51,050 --> 00:18:54,420
That's short! Shorter than now

616
00:18:54,420 --> 00:18:56,980
A lot longer...

617
00:18:54,420 --> 00:18:56,980
You remember a lot

618
00:18:56,980 --> 00:19:01,160
It's fried seafood rice

619
00:18:56,980 --> 00:19:01,160
Morioka, What is this?

620
00:19:01,160 --> 00:19:03,160
Fried rice (Scorched rice)

621
00:19:05,190 --> 00:19:08,800
My thinking is just different

622
00:19:05,190 --> 00:19:08,800
You're obsessed with it

623
00:19:12,300 --> 00:19:14,340
Oh wow

624
00:19:14,340 --> 00:19:17,440
Delicious

625
00:19:14,340 --> 00:19:17,440
You've done well Morioka

626
00:19:19,680 --> 00:19:22,040
So good

627
00:19:22,040 --> 00:19:24,410
Hahaha

628
00:19:22,040 --> 00:19:24,410
You've done very well

629
00:19:24,410 --> 00:19:27,120
It's seriously what I think, You've done well

630
00:19:28,620 --> 00:19:31,990
It's crazy good

631
00:19:28,620 --> 00:19:31,990
It's really good!

632
00:19:31,990 --> 00:19:35,990
So you can make stuff like this, huh!

633
00:19:31,990 --> 00:19:35,990
The fried rice is also delicious

634
00:19:37,960 --> 00:19:41,370
Cause he's a master chef

635
00:19:37,960 --> 00:19:41,370
Yeah

636
00:19:41,630 --> 00:19:45,640
Matsumoto's girlfriends...

637
00:19:41,630 --> 00:19:45,640
So how about,

638
00:19:45,640 --> 00:19:49,340
Do you know any

639
00:19:45,640 --> 00:19:49,340
moments when he had one?

640
00:19:49,340 --> 00:19:54,250
3rd year of middle school, in the recording room

641
00:19:55,980 --> 00:19:58,950
Oh that's right

642
00:19:55,980 --> 00:19:58,950
You were also in that club right?

643
00:19:58,950 --> 00:20:03,120
So yeah, when I was

644
00:19:58,950 --> 00:20:03,120
in the recording room

645
00:20:03,120 --> 00:20:07,760
You guys together, Hamada and yourself

646
00:20:03,120 --> 00:20:07,760
went in there and

647
00:20:07,760 --> 00:20:10,100
told me to go out for a moment

648
00:20:10,100 --> 00:20:12,700
And said, we're gonna do some confessing

649
00:20:10,100 --> 00:20:12,700
Confessing?

650
00:20:12,700 --> 00:20:17,040
Soon after

651
00:20:12,700 --> 00:20:17,040
the girls came in and they were "confessing"...

652
00:20:17,040 --> 00:20:19,040
Huh?

653
00:20:17,040 --> 00:20:19,040
What the?

654
00:20:19,040 --> 00:20:21,410
Hm?

655
00:20:21,410 --> 00:20:24,780
Then after a few minutes they came out

656
00:20:24,780 --> 00:20:27,950
and when I asked how it went

657
00:20:27,950 --> 00:20:31,580
I could tell on their faces that

658
00:20:27,950 --> 00:20:31,580
they were blushing and then

659
00:20:31,580 --> 00:20:36,320
they both told me "I guess it was okay!"

660
00:20:36,320 --> 00:20:39,990
Seriously,

661
00:20:36,320 --> 00:20:39,990
couldn't you tell that story a little better?

662
00:20:43,660 --> 00:20:46,170
We want to talk about things

663
00:20:43,660 --> 00:20:46,170
appropriate for the episode though

664
00:20:46,170 --> 00:20:49,700
It was like a double date

665
00:20:46,170 --> 00:20:49,700
Yeah so,

666
00:20:49,700 --> 00:20:53,780
With Hamada...That's

667
00:20:49,700 --> 00:20:53,780
actually related to that park ya know

668
00:20:53,780 --> 00:20:57,050
Oh right! Your first kiss

669
00:20:53,780 --> 00:20:57,050
The Amagasaki one

670
00:20:57,050 --> 00:21:02,950
That's some amazing history

671
00:20:57,050 --> 00:21:02,950
Wow

672
00:21:02,950 --> 00:21:08,090
Uhm yes.. around that time

673
00:21:02,950 --> 00:21:08,090
You were kind of a late bloomer right?

674
00:21:08,090 --> 00:21:10,890
I actually did date some girls though

675
00:21:08,090 --> 00:21:10,890
however,

676
00:21:10,890 --> 00:21:13,760
HUH!?

677
00:21:13,760 --> 00:21:17,670
No I wasn't hiding it but...

678
00:21:13,760 --> 00:21:17,670
So you were hiding it?

679
00:21:17,670 --> 00:21:20,140
It was a senior from the same broadcasting club

680
00:21:20,140 --> 00:21:22,410
Wait!

681
00:21:23,910 --> 00:21:26,080
Did you know about this?

682
00:21:23,910 --> 00:21:26,080
You didn't know?

683
00:21:26,080 --> 00:21:30,150
Dang he's a player...

684
00:21:31,620 --> 00:21:34,420
Morioka, were you really?

685
00:21:31,620 --> 00:21:34,420
So freaking much

686
00:21:35,790 --> 00:21:37,960
Oh so this is from middle school

687
00:21:35,790 --> 00:21:37,960
This is from the middle school years

688
00:21:37,960 --> 00:21:40,590
Wow, it's well kept

689
00:21:40,590 --> 00:21:43,130
I also have this in my house but

690
00:21:40,590 --> 00:21:43,130
Wow,

691
00:21:43,130 --> 00:21:46,500
I don't really look in it

692
00:21:46,500 --> 00:21:48,400
So the, broadcasting club

693
00:21:48,400 --> 00:21:51,770
Ah the club

694
00:21:48,400 --> 00:21:51,770
It's right here, the broadcasting club

695
00:21:51,770 --> 00:21:54,510
Ito, Myself and Hamada here

696
00:21:51,770 --> 00:21:54,510
Oh wow

697
00:21:54,510 --> 00:21:56,840
So the, broadcasting club

698
00:21:56,840 --> 00:22:00,280
It's right here, the broadcasting club

699
00:21:56,850 --> 00:22:00,280
Ah the club

700
00:22:00,310 --> 00:22:04,450
Ito, Myself and Hamada here

701
00:22:00,310 --> 00:22:04,450
Oh wow

702
00:22:06,550 --> 00:22:09,820
And here's Hayashi-sensei

703
00:22:06,550 --> 00:22:09,820
who was in charge of Hamada

704
00:22:09,820 --> 00:22:13,260
And during the 3rd year

705
00:22:09,820 --> 00:22:13,260
Right right

706
00:22:13,260 --> 00:22:16,430
When we had to start worrying about our

707
00:22:13,260 --> 00:22:16,430
high school applications

708
00:22:16,430 --> 00:22:22,170
This teacher here went to Hamada

709
00:22:16,430 --> 00:22:22,170
and said "you should worry about brushing your teeth instead"

710
00:22:22,870 --> 00:22:27,040
High school is out of your league,

711
00:22:22,870 --> 00:22:27,040
you hobo

712
00:22:27,040 --> 00:22:30,410
Are you really taking care of your hygiene properly?

713
00:22:27,040 --> 00:22:30,410
Hahaha!

714
00:22:30,410 --> 00:22:33,380
What does that mean?

715
00:22:30,410 --> 00:22:33,380
What kind of inspection is that?

716
00:22:33,380 --> 00:22:37,320
Anyway,

717
00:22:33,380 --> 00:22:37,320
Morioka's personality is really shining through isn't it

718
00:22:37,320 --> 00:22:40,290
Just like you told us, It's really...

719
00:22:37,320 --> 00:22:40,290
Really showing through

720
00:22:40,290 --> 00:22:43,160
When everybody were done with

721
00:22:40,290 --> 00:22:43,160
their snacks and threw them away

722
00:22:43,160 --> 00:22:46,430
You picked them up again and ate them didn't you

723
00:22:46,560 --> 00:22:49,500
This has been really successful

724
00:22:49,500 --> 00:22:52,770
It was really delicious

725
00:22:49,500 --> 00:22:52,770
With this good food,

726
00:22:52,770 --> 00:22:55,070
Thank you

727
00:22:52,770 --> 00:22:55,070
and that you got to meet him after all this time

728
00:22:55,070 --> 00:22:56,740
How about taking a commemorative photo

729
00:22:56,740 --> 00:22:58,370
Let's do it

730
00:22:56,740 --> 00:22:58,370
The long-awaited...

731
00:22:58,370 --> 00:23:00,410
Alright I'm taking one,

732
00:22:58,370 --> 00:23:00,410
wow, that peace sign...

733
00:23:00,410 --> 00:23:04,010
Okay, going now, smile!

734
00:23:00,410 --> 00:23:04,010
That was a good one!

735
00:23:04,010 --> 00:23:06,420
Oh my

736
00:23:06,420 --> 00:23:08,850
Definitely

737
00:23:06,420 --> 00:23:08,850
This time was good

738
00:23:10,190 --> 00:23:13,360
and iron is always smiling

739
00:23:10,190 --> 00:23:13,360
♬The wood top is so kind

740
00:23:15,390 --> 00:23:21,430
...And the plastic top is so poor♬

741
00:23:21,800 --> 00:23:24,570
Let's head to drunken crab island!

742
00:23:21,800 --> 00:23:24,570
Next time
