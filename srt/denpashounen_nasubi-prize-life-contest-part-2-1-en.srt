Nasubi

6
00:00:18,720 --> 00:00:21,680
Can people live by only winning prize contests?

7
00:00:21,720 --> 00:00:25,040
The challenge is to win prizes by phone or postcard entry

8
00:00:25,160 --> 00:00:27,880
The goal is to reach 1 million Yen in prize value.

00:00:40,520 --> 00:00:44,740

00:00:51,520 --> 00:00:54,240

Conclusion

19
00:01:20,700 --> 00:01:24,640
Nasubi in July 1998

20
00:01:26,440 --> 00:01:31,220
These are the entries for July, please watch in slow mode.

21
00:01:45,260 --> 00:01:48,540
A total of 5,787 entries

22
00:01:48,780 --> 00:01:52,660
Today, from the morning he writes postcard entries,
But there is no prize news at all

23
00:01:53,360 --> 00:01:56,060
However there is one thing on his mind...

24
00:01:56,360 --> 00:01:59,660
"Recently, I haven't won anything I can eat."

25
00:01:59,780 --> 00:02:04,480
Nasubi hasn't won anything since the seaweed last month

26
00:02:05,200 --> 00:02:09,390
And this month he has only won a sewing set

27
00:02:10,010 --> 00:02:11,400
Honestly...

28
00:02:11,600 --> 00:02:15,800
And Nasubi doesn't know that project has already started

29
00:02:16,600 --> 00:02:19,120
Nasubi's room internet live stream!

30
00:02:19,550 --> 00:02:27,160
Nasubi's room live broadcast internet video feed

31
00:02:28,680 --> 00:02:32,460
By the way, this is the Nasubi live stream headquarters

32
00:02:33,500 --> 00:02:40,260
Wearing staff T-shirts, 50 people watch over and control this 24 hours a day

33
00:02:40,800 --> 00:02:44,460
Using the joystick they must cover up Nasubi's parts at all times

34
00:02:44,460 --> 00:02:46,960
A live broadcast first ever historical challenge!

35
00:02:47,820 --> 00:02:51,420
They could not let their guard down for even a moment!

36
00:02:48,910 --> 00:02:51,340
Aaahhh!!

37
00:02:49,500 --> 00:02:51,340
Watch out!

38
00:02:49,860 --> 00:02:51,340
Be careful!

39
00:02:51,820 --> 00:02:55,200
Please enjoy this staff under high pressure tension footage

40
00:02:56,480 --> 00:03:00,680
This morning Nasubi is writing letters when...

41
00:03:00,820 --> 00:03:03,920
Knock knock, Delivery Service

42
00:03:05,960 --> 00:03:08,380
What is this I wonder?

43
00:03:08,880 --> 00:03:12,060
I won a hair dryer ♥

44
00:03:12,120 --> 00:03:15,380
I'm really not winning any food here

45
00:03:15,940 --> 00:03:19,800
I can't eat this hair dryer can I...

46
00:03:21,600 --> 00:03:23,060
A win?!

47
00:03:23,400 --> 00:03:26,560
A win! Is it food?

48
00:03:26,900 --> 00:03:28,320
But...

49
00:03:28,480 --> 00:03:32,520
A how to video for removing bad armpit odor

50
00:03:33,820 --> 00:03:37,660
I really can't eat this kind of junk

51
00:03:37,890 --> 00:03:40,700
I'm in no situation to worry about this kind of thing!

52
00:03:40,920 --> 00:03:43,700
It's true he is in no situation for that.

53
00:03:46,080 --> 00:03:48,680
It's here, It's here, something came today too ♥

54
00:03:48,920 --> 00:03:50,100
But...

55
00:03:50,380 --> 00:03:51,300
Dammit!

56
00:03:51,320 --> 00:03:53,880
This won't swell my stomach!

57
00:03:54,480 --> 00:03:56,720
Small vacuum cleaner ♥

58
00:03:57,880 --> 00:04:01,860
"Everyday there is a lack of food, yet I have 2 vacuum cleaners."

59
00:04:02,180 --> 00:04:05,000
That's right, there was another he won before

60
00:04:05,360 --> 00:04:06,940
Again, nothing I can eat!

61
00:04:07,020 --> 00:04:08,860
I want to win food!!

62
00:04:10,640 --> 00:04:13,660
Nothing came that he could eat, the winnings for July!

63
00:04:15,260 --> 00:04:19,520
526,040 Yen remains until the 1 Million Yen goal

64
00:04:21,200 --> 00:04:23,880
Nasubi in August

65
00:04:26,240 --> 00:04:28,780
These are the entries for August

66
00:04:42,280 --> 00:04:45,480
A total of 6,306 entries

67
00:04:45,880 --> 00:04:48,100
Nasubi is writing as usual today

68
00:04:48,400 --> 00:04:49,980
But as always...

69
00:04:50,280 --> 00:04:53,460
"There is no winning food news."

70
00:04:53,940 --> 00:04:55,140
Then...

71
00:04:55,270 --> 00:04:56,300
Knock

72
00:04:55,270 --> 00:04:56,300
Knock

73
00:04:57,480 --> 00:04:58,720
Special delivery

74
00:04:59,060 --> 00:05:00,420
A win!

75
00:05:00,480 --> 00:05:02,620
Is it food this time!?

76
00:05:02,780 --> 00:05:04,220
But...

77
00:05:04,480 --> 00:05:05,780
This is not it !

78
00:05:06,080 --> 00:05:10,240
But you know what... This is cool

79
00:05:10,460 --> 00:05:13,000
No flavor though...

80
00:05:13,360 --> 00:05:15,480
Something pretty cool with no flavor is...?

81
00:05:15,700 --> 00:05:19,280
Pocket Board by Docomo ♥
TL:Mobile phone attachment to send 10 Yen E-mail upto 2kb!

82
00:05:19,800 --> 00:05:24,880
"Dear lord! Next time can you change it to a little something edible, please!"

83
00:05:25,260 --> 00:05:26,720
The next day

84
00:05:29,080 --> 00:05:32,420
Was his wish able to reach God!?

85
00:05:33,730 --> 00:05:35,920
I wonder what kind of thing has arrived ♥

86
00:05:36,340 --> 00:05:37,920
But...

87
00:05:39,640 --> 00:05:42,400
"It's a double, another double!"

88
00:05:42,860 --> 00:05:45,800
Tooth brush and tooth paste set ♥

89
00:05:46,180 --> 00:05:50,560
Like the vacuum cleaner before, this is the second toothbrush win

90
00:05:50,800 --> 00:05:52,200
However this time...

91
00:05:52,340 --> 00:05:54,660
Toothbrush x4 yay!

92
00:05:55,040 --> 00:05:56,140
So many wins ♥

93
00:05:56,220 --> 00:06:00,580
This is the one I got previously

94
00:06:00,740 --> 00:06:02,080
Then Nasubi...

95
00:06:02,770 --> 00:06:03,980
First time win

96
00:06:02,770 --> 00:06:03,980
Second time win

97
00:06:04,080 --> 00:06:06,320
Double toothbrush technique power

98
00:06:08,140 --> 00:06:11,340
"Stop with these stupid wins! I need food!"

99
00:06:12,720 --> 00:06:14,540
Nasubi is becoming desperate

100
00:06:14,540 --> 00:06:15,440
BUT!

101
00:06:15,680 --> 00:06:17,660
It started to bleed ♥

102
00:06:18,040 --> 00:06:20,280
Bleeding for the second time too.

103
00:06:22,660 --> 00:06:24,120
A few days later...

104
00:06:27,300 --> 00:06:29,240
What could it be this time?!

105
00:06:29,600 --> 00:06:30,840
Then...

106
00:06:36,180 --> 00:06:38,540
Could this be...

107
00:06:38,580 --> 00:06:39,580
I knew it

108
00:06:39,680 --> 00:06:41,780
It's rice ♥

109
00:06:42,760 --> 00:06:45,000
This is the 3rd rice win

110
00:06:46,200 --> 00:06:49,020
Nasubi does his long lost winning dance

111
00:06:50,280 --> 00:06:52,980
But his reaction is strange...

112
00:06:54,780 --> 00:06:59,780
But you know... Although I'm happy to have alot of rice...

113
00:07:00,240 --> 00:07:03,480
I'm really searching for something....

114
00:07:03,680 --> 00:07:06,880
Something with a strong flavor you know...

115
00:07:07,040 --> 00:07:09,580
Something fatty, juicy and greasy

116
00:07:09,780 --> 00:07:11,500
I want some side dish!

117
00:07:11,600 --> 00:07:14,840
I keep winning rice, so of course I want some side dish!

118
00:07:14,940 --> 00:07:17,600
If I only had side dishes...

119
00:07:18,040 --> 00:07:21,480
It would be only natural that I'd want  to eat rice!

120
00:07:22,580 --> 00:07:26,900
Humans are such disgustingly selfish creatures.

121
00:07:27,740 --> 00:07:30,400
Nasubi is having his only rice dinner

122
00:07:30,940 --> 00:07:34,040
Today I didn't win any side dishes again...

123
00:07:34,160 --> 00:07:39,780
Without side dishes... Summer will never come for me.

124
00:07:40,340 --> 00:07:46,060
To reverse these thoughts he wins something wonderful that indicates the start of summer...

125
00:07:48,520 --> 00:07:51,780
The start of summer item is...?

126
00:07:52,060 --> 00:07:55,180
Inflatable ring ♥

127
00:07:55,280 --> 00:07:56,640
However

128
00:07:56,640 --> 00:07:57,500
I feel sick

129
00:07:57,560 --> 00:07:59,060
Feeling sick?

130
00:07:59,180 --> 00:08:01,140
There certainly is a reason for that

131
00:08:01,660 --> 00:08:05,400
"When I received it, there was no meaning to it. All crumpled and flat"

132
00:08:05,540 --> 00:08:09,140
"But when I began to inflate it, I soon ran out of stamina..."

133
00:08:09,200 --> 00:08:11,820
"And my head became all dizzy"

134
00:08:11,900 --> 00:08:16,100
"I could see water fleas here and there floating in front of my eyes"

135
00:08:16,280 --> 00:08:18,640
"It was a bad situation!"

136
00:08:18,980 --> 00:08:23,340
And after this a big event that will certainly tell Nasubi summer is here!

137
00:08:24,620 --> 00:08:26,840
Nasubi is writing a letter when...

138
00:08:28,320 --> 00:08:30,200
What happened?

139
00:08:31,240 --> 00:08:32,340
Hm?

140
00:08:33,280 --> 00:08:35,420
"The air-con stopped...!!"

141
00:08:35,880 --> 00:08:37,360
Hold on a sec...

142
00:08:39,440 --> 00:08:42,700
Hey! Why did it suddenly stop like that?

143
00:08:43,020 --> 00:08:44,640
Two hours later

144
00:08:45,620 --> 00:08:48,180
This heat is uncomfortable

145
00:08:48,620 --> 00:08:51,400
I should open the window

146
00:08:53,780 --> 00:08:56,180
It's just getting hotter with it closed

147
00:08:58,620 --> 00:09:00,680
Ah, the locust are singing

148
00:09:00,780 --> 00:09:02,320
Then two hours later ...

149
00:09:03,520 --> 00:09:07,700
Nah. I can't write postcards in a situation like this

150
00:09:07,900 --> 00:09:09,620
It's too hot.

151
00:09:10,160 --> 00:09:11,400
The next day

152
00:09:12,240 --> 00:09:14,140
Good morning (Day 201)

153
00:09:14,200 --> 00:09:16,200
Or rather, It's HOT!

154
00:09:16,280 --> 00:09:19,100
Hot, hot, hot, hot hottttttt!

155
00:09:19,940 --> 00:09:23,960
Today, Nasubi has stopped writing postcard entries

156
00:09:25,120 --> 00:09:26,020
Work!

157
00:09:26,740 --> 00:09:27,720
Work!

158
00:09:28,320 --> 00:09:29,160
Work!

159
00:09:29,160 --> 00:09:30,200
Then...

160
00:09:30,360 --> 00:09:31,120
Beep ♥

161
00:09:31,200 --> 00:09:33,870
(Breeze)

162
00:09:35,470 --> 00:09:36,730
It's working ♥

163
00:09:37,250 --> 00:09:39,420
Air-con restoration dance!

164
00:09:43,370 --> 00:09:47,440
"Although I don't have any idea about what happened..."

165
00:09:47,470 --> 00:09:50,130
"What a fearful thing."

166
00:09:50,900 --> 00:09:55,260
After this a definitive summer item is won...

167
00:09:57,320 --> 00:10:00,290
What is a defining summer item?

168
00:10:00,440 --> 00:10:02,140
Watermelon ♥

169
00:10:02,610 --> 00:10:05,890
"Speaking of watermelon, we should do that thing!"

170
00:10:06,620 --> 00:10:08,620
Towel

171
00:10:06,620 --> 00:10:08,620
Vacuum cleaner

172
00:10:06,620 --> 00:10:08,620
Watermelon

173
00:10:08,820 --> 00:10:11,290
"Suikawari" (Watermelon pinata)

174
00:10:11,380 --> 00:10:12,610
Start!

175
00:10:13,150 --> 00:10:14,890
Spinning begins!

176
00:10:15,040 --> 00:10:16,430
1, 2, 3..

177
00:10:21,250 --> 00:10:23,050
10...

178
00:10:27,120 --> 00:10:29,260
However...

179
00:10:29,950 --> 00:10:33,020
Where's the Melon? I don't know...

180
00:10:34,200 --> 00:10:35,630
Bi-nasu in a pinch!

181
00:10:43,840 --> 00:10:46,270
You shouldn't play with your food you know.

182
00:10:47,310 --> 00:10:50,050
He cuts the watermelon with the knife from the cutlery set he won

183
00:10:51,710 --> 00:10:52,930
Then...

184
00:10:53,600 --> 00:10:54,970
Ta-da~ ♥

185
00:10:55,550 --> 00:10:57,230
Let's eat ♥♥

186
00:10:59,870 --> 00:11:03,860
"I finished eating it all today!"

187
00:11:04,030 --> 00:11:05,550
Thank you for the food!

188
00:11:05,870 --> 00:11:07,380
But...

189
00:11:07,400 --> 00:11:08,530
You know what...

190
00:11:08,600 --> 00:11:10,650
"I want a side dish..."

191
00:11:11,240 --> 00:11:12,340
The next day

192
00:11:16,660 --> 00:11:19,390
Has Nasubi's wish been answered this time?

193
00:11:21,420 --> 00:11:25,060
Oh! Look at how delicious the wrapping is, it could be sweets!

194
00:11:25,090 --> 00:11:26,940
I'm feeling good about this! ♥♥

195
00:11:27,100 --> 00:11:28,650
Ohhhhh? What is it?

196
00:11:28,670 --> 00:11:29,710
That is!

197
00:11:29,850 --> 00:11:31,610
What the heck!!

198
00:11:31,950 --> 00:11:34,020
It's a lighter

199
00:11:34,970 --> 00:11:37,180
A lighter cannot fill my stomach

200
00:11:37,230 --> 00:11:38,730
I can't eat this !!

201
00:11:39,950 --> 00:11:42,220
But here Nasubi...

202
00:11:44,670 --> 00:11:47,850
We now have flames from the lighter hey!

203
00:11:47,920 --> 00:11:49,630
Yehehehehe

204
00:11:50,000 --> 00:11:52,180
The sight of the flame invokes...

205
00:11:52,420 --> 00:11:53,810
God of fire

206
00:11:54,430 --> 00:11:55,700
He begins to pray

207
00:11:56,000 --> 00:11:58,910
Please guide Nasubi to some side dishes!

208
00:11:59,780 --> 00:12:01,720
Please make this a reality

209
00:12:02,090 --> 00:12:04,130
I put my faith in you!!

210
00:12:04,820 --> 00:12:08,660
At that moment the God of prizes heard Nasubi's prayers

211
00:12:12,430 --> 00:12:14,730
What gift did God grant him?

212
00:12:18,110 --> 00:12:19,690
What can I say about this!

213
00:12:20,300 --> 00:12:22,300
What a beautiful item

214
00:12:22,410 --> 00:12:23,210
Beautiful?

215
00:12:23,320 --> 00:12:26,320
This is a feeling that Nasubi has been defeated huh...

216
00:12:26,860 --> 00:12:31,180
Nasubi has received pickled Nasubi!
TL:Nasubi is Japanese for aubergine / eggplant

217
00:12:31,490 --> 00:12:34,160
Pickled aubergine!

218
00:12:34,610 --> 00:12:36,440
My prayers were answered ♥

219
00:12:36,520 --> 00:12:38,850
After a long hiatus, a winning dance!

220
00:12:40,490 --> 00:12:41,780
Aubergine

221
00:12:40,490 --> 00:12:41,780
Rice

222
00:12:42,110 --> 00:12:44,350
Accompanied with rice.

223
00:12:45,470 --> 00:12:48,500
Pickled food goes really well with rice you know! ♥

224
00:12:49,240 --> 00:12:52,670
"I'm so glad to be born Japanese."

225
00:12:53,690 --> 00:12:57,180
The next day the God of prizes will also smile down on Nasubi.

226
00:12:57,770 --> 00:12:58,980
The next day

227
00:13:02,240 --> 00:13:04,160
What did he win?

228
00:13:05,160 --> 00:13:07,470
Weider sports jelly drink

229
00:13:12,760 --> 00:13:13,850
It's sweet ♥♥

230
00:13:16,210 --> 00:13:20,690
It's been so long since something sweet he completely looses himself in the moment

231
00:13:21,730 --> 00:13:26,590
He completely forgets to do his very important ritual...

232
00:13:26,850 --> 00:13:28,280
That is...

233
00:13:29,570 --> 00:13:32,040
The winning dance as a display of gratitude

234
00:13:32,830 --> 00:13:37,450
The God of prizes has now gone silent on Nasubi

235
00:13:39,280 --> 00:13:40,640
One week later

236
00:13:41,660 --> 00:13:45,770
I haven't won anything for about a week now...

237
00:13:47,340 --> 00:13:48,850
Another week later

238
00:13:49,610 --> 00:13:51,020
This is getting serious!

239
00:13:51,580 --> 00:13:55,860
"It's been 2 weeks since I won weider jelly drinks and haven't got anything since..."

240
00:13:56,180 --> 00:14:00,300
It's been a long time since I haven't had any wins like this

241
00:14:00,750 --> 00:14:02,420
Then Nasubi...

242
00:14:03,200 --> 00:14:04,810
Hirosue Ryoko poster

243
00:14:05,360 --> 00:14:08,380
He prays to Miss Hirosue.

244
00:14:09,760 --> 00:14:11,320
The next day

245
00:14:11,880 --> 00:14:13,550
Today he is writing postcards

246
00:14:13,760 --> 00:14:14,910
Then...

247
00:14:15,000 --> 00:14:15,780
Slap!

248
00:14:17,240 --> 00:14:18,580
What's that sound?!

249
00:14:23,070 --> 00:14:23,920
Oh!

250
00:14:24,670 --> 00:14:26,140
It's post!

251
00:14:26,210 --> 00:14:30,160
It's just a letter so it wont be something important...

252
00:14:31,210 --> 00:14:36,190
Featuring the Spice girls,
SPICE the Movie (JP 25 July 1998 release)

253
00:14:36,250 --> 00:14:38,750
Discount ticket...

254
00:14:38,960 --> 00:14:39,740
Dammit!

255
00:14:39,920 --> 00:14:42,700
It would be better if it was a VIP invitation

256
00:14:42,780 --> 00:14:45,060
But this is a discount ticket!!

257
00:14:45,620 --> 00:14:48,250
This is a bit harsh...

258
00:14:48,810 --> 00:14:50,040
Then...

259
00:14:50,420 --> 00:14:51,340
Slap!

260
00:14:53,160 --> 00:14:54,420
What's this sound?

261
00:14:54,530 --> 00:14:56,340
It's the post

262
00:14:56,470 --> 00:14:58,810
What is it I wonder ♥

263
00:14:59,080 --> 00:15:02,610
I hope it's not anything like last time...

264
00:15:03,470 --> 00:15:05,320
That was a painful experience

265
00:15:06,370 --> 00:15:09,600
Nasubi has high hopes as he opens the letter

266
00:15:10,120 --> 00:15:11,730
However...

267
00:15:12,800 --> 00:15:13,740
Pffft...

268
00:15:14,160 --> 00:15:16,680
"Don't send me this junk!"

269
00:15:16,820 --> 00:15:21,020
Car navigation and car audio pamphlet

270
00:15:21,150 --> 00:15:24,490
You're not even close to being a prize!!

271
00:15:27,150 --> 00:15:30,500
Could it be the curse of forgetting the winning dance?!

272
00:15:31,560 --> 00:15:33,050
The next day

273
00:15:34,260 --> 00:15:37,800
The pickled aubergine is finished
and it's back to eating plain rice

274
00:15:37,960 --> 00:15:42,120
Paper prizes....

275
00:15:42,140 --> 00:15:45,050
Paper prizes just keep coming...

276
00:15:45,370 --> 00:15:49,580
But the God of prizes will keep the paper prizes flowing.

277
00:15:52,080 --> 00:15:53,340
The next paper prize is?!

278
00:15:53,630 --> 00:15:56,280
Free English lesson ticket

279
00:15:57,180 --> 00:16:00,170
This is the second time he won it!

280
00:16:00,400 --> 00:16:01,390
Dammit!!!

281
00:16:03,530 --> 00:16:06,560
Nasubi super rage !

282
00:16:11,100 --> 00:16:12,830
I give up.

283
00:16:13,570 --> 00:16:17,850
Savage attack of the paper prizes!
These are Augusts winnings...

284
00:16:19,980 --> 00:16:21,360
Until the 1 million Yen goal...

285
00:16:21,360 --> 00:16:24,420
461,926円 remains!

286
00:16:26,180 --> 00:16:28,930
Nasubi in September

287
00:16:31,260 --> 00:16:34,100
These are the entries made for September

288
00:16:46,700 --> 00:16:49,900
A total of 4,792 entries

289
00:16:50,920 --> 00:16:53,320
It's been a while since hearing the sound of knocking!

290
00:16:55,100 --> 00:16:58,480
Has the anger of the prize God settled?!

291
00:16:58,720 --> 00:17:00,060
But...

292
00:17:00,720 --> 00:17:02,850
It's good that something has come

293
00:17:02,960 --> 00:17:05,790
It looks like a paper prize...

294
00:17:06,290 --> 00:17:10,140
"I've won 4 sequential paper prizes!!"

295
00:17:10,760 --> 00:17:13,310
Judging from the sound, it's really paper

296
00:17:13,870 --> 00:17:18,450
"Useless freaking paper!!
I'm gonna tear you up into a million pieces!!"

297
00:17:23,380 --> 00:17:25,860
A poster of Miss Hirosue ♥

298
00:17:26,370 --> 00:17:28,530
This is the second Hirosue poster win

299
00:17:29,280 --> 00:17:32,130
Now I have 2 Miss Hirosue posters hanging up...

300
00:17:32,140 --> 00:17:34,820
What extravagance ♥

301
00:17:34,940 --> 00:17:39,800
After winning a Hirosue poster,
The God of prizes seems to have settled down...

302
00:17:41,330 --> 00:17:44,270
But once again that sound comes to haunt Nasubi...

303
00:17:44,680 --> 00:17:46,260
Slap!

304
00:17:46,420 --> 00:17:48,090
But what's inside?

305
00:17:50,980 --> 00:17:53,540
"What!! Why!!"

306
00:17:56,180 --> 00:17:59,640
Car navigation pamphlet...

307
00:18:00,180 --> 00:18:02,620
Gods rage has still not settled...

308
00:18:03,730 --> 00:18:06,040
"Dammit! Dammit!! Dammit!!!!!"

309
00:18:08,040 --> 00:18:12,510
To remove this bad fortune,
He doubles down on post card entries

310
00:18:13,550 --> 00:18:15,390
A few days later

311
00:18:16,510 --> 00:18:18,940
Please pay attention to Nasubi's skin tone!

312
00:18:19,890 --> 00:18:22,060
As you can see, he's sunburnt!

313
00:18:22,640 --> 00:18:26,920
To be honest, how this happened was...

314
00:18:27,180 --> 00:18:28,590
Like this

315
00:18:28,840 --> 00:18:31,460
Summer holiday THE BEST ♥ ♥

316
00:18:31,730 --> 00:18:34,050
Nasubi's summer holiday

317
00:18:34,970 --> 00:18:39,810
After not leaving the apartment for 8 months
The staff gave Nasubi this present ♥

318
00:18:42,180 --> 00:18:44,330
Has he lifted the unfortunate curse also?!

319
00:18:44,600 --> 00:18:45,780
However...

320
00:18:48,080 --> 00:18:50,240
♪ A-Nasubi, A-Nasubi, A-HeadPHONE! ♪

321
00:18:50,750 --> 00:18:52,770
He won a pair of headphones!

322
00:18:53,310 --> 00:18:56,350
I won Headphones YO!
Song by Nasubi

323
00:18:55,630 --> 00:18:59,700
Even though, I won them YO
It's all good Zu- Zu- Cha!!

324
00:18:59,700 --> 00:19:00,780
Zu- Zu- ZuCha!

325
00:19:00,820 --> 00:19:03,070
Zero significance YO! Zu- Zu- Cha!

326
00:19:03,990 --> 00:19:04,690
Look!

327
00:19:05,770 --> 00:19:07,740
No sound can be heard...

328
00:19:08,040 --> 00:19:11,420
"Can my prize luck only move in one direction downwards?"

329
00:19:13,060 --> 00:19:14,490
A few days later

330
00:19:15,870 --> 00:19:17,500
A win!

331
00:19:17,900 --> 00:19:19,210
However...

332
00:19:27,730 --> 00:19:34,220
"This prize is a great jump up in uselessness in comparison to the headphones..."

333
00:19:34,960 --> 00:19:38,960
A CD-ROM Encyclopedia

334
00:19:40,370 --> 00:19:41,790
The next day

335
00:19:42,840 --> 00:19:46,240
He is writing postcards this morning with high hopes of a win

336
00:19:46,650 --> 00:19:48,120
However...

337
00:19:48,640 --> 00:19:53,060
"Today... Today that sound echoed once again throughout this room"

338
00:19:53,700 --> 00:19:55,140
Slap!

339
00:19:56,400 --> 00:19:58,080
Yet another paper prize?!

340
00:19:58,760 --> 00:20:00,760
But what did Nasubi see?

341
00:20:04,800 --> 00:20:08,650
It's the post but it's quite a big item...

342
00:20:08,820 --> 00:20:09,980
WHAT?!

343
00:20:11,290 --> 00:20:14,430
What could it be that has made Nasubi so happy?

344
00:20:14,560 --> 00:20:18,400
W-w-Whaaat could be inside I wonder~?

345
00:20:18,860 --> 00:20:20,800
What the heck is this?!

346
00:20:25,660 --> 00:20:31,540
The 51st Japan Cycling championship event video

347
00:20:34,650 --> 00:20:36,020
The next day

348
00:20:36,800 --> 00:20:39,900
This situation is pretty bad huh

349
00:20:40,020 --> 00:20:41,950
Please, give me a good day!!

350
00:20:42,820 --> 00:20:45,310
Will today be a good day?!

351
00:20:45,870 --> 00:20:47,070
However...

352
00:20:47,320 --> 00:20:48,520
Slap!

353
00:20:48,980 --> 00:20:52,450
"Today... Today also the post was delivered..."

354
00:20:52,660 --> 00:20:55,620
This slim packet, I wonder if there's anything inside

355
00:20:55,880 --> 00:20:59,940
I hope that it's something that will make me happy in here...

356
00:21:00,840 --> 00:21:01,700
Please!

357
00:21:01,720 --> 00:21:02,450
HOWEVER!

358
00:21:05,310 --> 00:21:07,560
I've been deceived...

359
00:21:07,740 --> 00:21:11,090
Learner drivers new students information brochure

360
00:21:11,530 --> 00:21:14,030
"Wonderful!! Such a splendid delivery!!"

361
00:21:23,410 --> 00:21:26,760
Nasubi RAGE!

362
00:21:28,850 --> 00:21:30,250
The next day

363
00:21:31,400 --> 00:21:33,800
Will today be a good day?!

364
00:21:34,540 --> 00:21:35,720
Slap!

365
00:21:38,420 --> 00:21:44,240
"As always, it can't be helped, but until the moment I look inside I always have great expectations!"

366
00:21:45,400 --> 00:21:46,180
However!!

367
00:21:46,960 --> 00:21:50,160
My mouth was stuck wide open...

368
00:21:51,300 --> 00:21:54,290
Hotel brochures

369
00:21:55,150 --> 00:21:59,170
"If you're gonna send me these, at least make them free stay!"

370
00:22:01,420 --> 00:22:04,890
These prizes are so worthless!

371
00:22:05,010 --> 00:22:07,240
Literal junk!

372
00:22:07,320 --> 00:22:09,040
I cannot use!

373
00:22:09,250 --> 00:22:11,040
Zero help!

374
00:22:11,230 --> 00:22:14,180
Why is it turning out like this?

375
00:22:14,600 --> 00:22:22,510
"If everything is happening like this then the only explanation Is that I'm cursed and becoming possessed by evil spirits!"

376
00:22:23,680 --> 00:22:25,170
The next day

377
00:22:26,180 --> 00:22:27,320
Will today be the...

378
00:22:27,410 --> 00:22:28,570
Slap!

379
00:22:29,790 --> 00:22:31,500
Again, it's only letters.

380
00:22:31,740 --> 00:22:36,580
In regards to the entries for this prize holiday,
Thank you for participating.

381
00:22:37,130 --> 00:22:40,350
The holiday invitation selection...

382
00:22:40,400 --> 00:22:41,310
WHAT?!

383
00:22:41,310 --> 00:22:43,200
He won a holiday?!

384
00:22:43,850 --> 00:22:49,040
But unfortunately you were not selected as a winner.

385
00:22:49,880 --> 00:22:50,920
SHOCK!

386
00:22:51,380 --> 00:22:52,800
But...

387
00:22:52,860 --> 00:22:54,090
However!

388
00:22:54,090 --> 00:22:56,240
It says 'however'!

389
00:22:57,320 --> 00:23:01,370
However, this time as a reward for your entry

390
00:23:01,500 --> 00:23:03,540
As a show of our appreciation...

391
00:23:04,850 --> 00:23:07,610
As a show of appreciation? What's this?

392
00:23:08,120 --> 00:23:13,770
The normal travel package price is 129,800 Yen ....

393
00:23:13,960 --> 00:23:19,240
But we can offer you this special information discount price of
Just 99,800 Yen ♥

394
00:23:19,440 --> 00:23:21,070
DOUBLE SHOCK!!

395
00:23:21,540 --> 00:23:27,630
What sad, unfortunate news.

396
00:23:33,650 --> 00:23:35,520
I can't take it anymore!!

397
00:23:36,720 --> 00:23:41,090
Not a single thing he could eat this month,
These are Septembers winnings

398
00:23:41,810 --> 00:23:46,240
440,626円 Remains until the 1 million Yen goal

399
00:23:47,820 --> 00:23:50,610
Nasubi in October

400
00:23:52,720 --> 00:23:54,970
These are the entries for October

401
00:24:10,780 --> 00:24:14,030
A total of 5,875 entries

402
00:24:14,350 --> 00:24:18,060
Recently, all I have been getting is

403
00:24:18,110 --> 00:24:22,490
Nothing but paper style post items

404
00:24:23,040 --> 00:24:25,870
"Are you scared to come here, prizes?!"

405
00:24:26,440 --> 00:24:27,770
Then...

406
00:24:28,270 --> 00:24:30,740
No wins for the duration of a week

407
00:24:31,770 --> 00:24:35,070
Nasubi does nothing but write as many entries as possible

408
00:24:35,930 --> 00:24:37,300
However...

409
00:24:37,800 --> 00:24:42,010
"I'm not even receiving any post at all now."

410
00:24:42,730 --> 00:24:46,190
The signs of death are starting to show...

411
00:24:49,220 --> 00:24:52,680
Nasubi's prize life contest is in the greatest pinch of all

412
00:24:52,980 --> 00:24:55,420
We must do something for him!

413
00:24:55,570 --> 00:24:57,140
That is...

414
00:24:57,530 --> 00:24:59,280
That day at midnight...

415
00:25:04,540 --> 00:25:06,520
The producer appears!

416
00:25:14,520 --> 00:25:15,930
Then

417
00:25:16,340 --> 00:25:18,480
Road trip

418
00:25:18,980 --> 00:25:20,850
Where did we arrive...?

419
00:25:21,100 --> 00:25:22,380
Take off the mask

420
00:25:29,180 --> 00:25:35,970
"Although the atmosphere differs, the all-star prize decoration inside makes for a bustling room feel"

421
00:25:37,550 --> 00:25:38,980
We moved?

422
00:25:39,170 --> 00:25:40,590
Correct ♥

423
00:25:40,810 --> 00:25:42,290
Feng Shui ♥

424
00:25:42,360 --> 00:25:44,840
That thing everyone's been talking about?

425
00:25:45,920 --> 00:25:52,030
After seeing Nasubi's streak of misfortune, the staff decided to move house for a second time to increase his luck

426
00:25:53,390 --> 00:25:54,670
Thank you very much!

427
00:25:54,860 --> 00:25:58,050
I'll write postcards untill my hands fall off!
I'll do my best!

428
00:25:58,540 --> 00:26:00,380
Feng Shui BANZAI !!

429
00:26:00,600 --> 00:26:05,730
However the staff have again made a big mistake this time also!

430
00:26:06,610 --> 00:26:08,180
Last times mistake was...

431
00:26:08,740 --> 00:26:11,720
After completing the move to the new house first time

432
00:26:12,200 --> 00:26:14,510
I can't find my rice.
I'm sure I had rice...

433
00:26:14,590 --> 00:26:15,450
Then!

434
00:26:15,530 --> 00:26:18,620
Sorry, sorry, I left it in the truck

435
00:26:19,100 --> 00:26:20,840
They forgot the rice!

436
00:26:21,020 --> 00:26:25,230
It's okay to forget the other stuff, but not the rice !!

437
00:26:25,700 --> 00:26:27,180
No, but the truck...

438
00:26:27,220 --> 00:26:29,340
It's not the trucks fault!!

439
00:26:29,410 --> 00:26:31,490
NASUBI RAGE !!

440
00:26:31,890 --> 00:26:33,720
And this time...

441
00:26:34,400 --> 00:26:35,140
Oh?

442
00:26:35,530 --> 00:26:36,660
Oh-h-h-h-h-h-h?

443
00:26:36,820 --> 00:26:38,350
The rice isn't here!

444
00:26:38,460 --> 00:26:40,380
The staff forgot the rice again.

445
00:26:41,490 --> 00:26:43,480
Where did they put it?!

446
00:26:43,770 --> 00:26:44,980
Here.

447
00:26:45,450 --> 00:26:47,230
Hmmmm~~~?

448
00:26:47,620 --> 00:26:49,620
Hmmmmmm?????

449
00:26:55,070 --> 00:26:57,100
He finally discovers it.

450
00:26:57,620 --> 00:27:00,810
They shouldn't mess around like this!

451
00:27:01,530 --> 00:27:05,370
He writes many entries for wonderful prizes hoping to win.

452
00:27:05,850 --> 00:27:07,280
Then...

453
00:27:07,530 --> 00:27:11,310
"I have spoken this comment many times up until now..."

454
00:27:11,420 --> 00:27:13,200
I want some side dishes!

455
00:27:13,200 --> 00:27:15,610
A flavor with impact!

456
00:27:15,640 --> 00:27:18,160
Something greasy!!

457
00:27:18,890 --> 00:27:21,040
The fatty food he won before was...

458
00:27:21,460 --> 00:27:22,890
Duck breasts ♥

459
00:27:22,940 --> 00:27:28,600
In June he won the Duck breasts and hasn't had anything in the 4 months since!

460
00:27:29,470 --> 00:27:32,140
"I want to eat something fatty!!"

461
00:27:32,820 --> 00:27:38,380
"And finally that moment in my prize life contest has come!!"

462
00:27:41,150 --> 00:27:43,420
Is it a long awaited win?!

463
00:27:43,640 --> 00:27:46,780
Finally, is it the first prize of the new house?

464
00:27:46,970 --> 00:27:48,410
Yes, yes, yes, yes

465
00:27:49,100 --> 00:27:51,020
What's this, what's this?

466
00:27:52,590 --> 00:27:55,130
This.... Box....

467
00:27:55,500 --> 00:27:58,460
Nasubi seems to know what's inside by just looking at it

468
00:27:58,860 --> 00:28:00,420
He he he ♥

469
00:28:01,000 --> 00:28:02,800
Time to open!

470
00:28:04,450 --> 00:28:06,380
I knew it. It's that.

471
00:28:06,500 --> 00:28:07,470
And!

472
00:28:07,540 --> 00:28:11,360
This is only the first new house prize!

473
00:28:11,530 --> 00:28:13,160
It's finally here!

474
00:28:13,240 --> 00:28:15,100
Just what is it?!

475
00:28:16,890 --> 00:28:19,810
I won potato crisps! ♥

476
00:28:21,950 --> 00:28:24,360
Look how many there is ♥♥

477
00:28:25,550 --> 00:28:28,960
Nasubi is very emotional, and it's a long awaited winning dance!

478
00:28:29,780 --> 00:28:36,500
"I cannot even remember how many months it has been since I have done a winning dance with such power and vigor!"

479
00:28:36,510 --> 00:28:41,380
"I danced with my full body and soul!"

480
00:28:42,110 --> 00:28:43,920
Let's eat ♥

481
00:28:44,410 --> 00:28:50,150
How should we open it? Like this, is it not?

482
00:28:55,960 --> 00:28:57,400
It's open

483
00:29:04,600 --> 00:29:08,030
"The delightful smell of potato crisps."

484
00:29:14,890 --> 00:29:20,400
"As I opened my mouth wide and placed the potato crisp inside,
I lost all recollection of awareness in that moment"

485
00:29:20,430 --> 00:29:25,090
"It was as if something in my body had parted and flown away."

486
00:29:35,040 --> 00:29:36,080
It's great...

487
00:29:36,380 --> 00:29:37,780
The best...

488
00:29:39,690 --> 00:29:41,160
Another win!

489
00:29:41,380 --> 00:29:42,920

491

"Nasubi's prize life contest has gone from Hell to Heaven"

492
00:29:55,450 --> 00:29:57,200
Delush ♥

493
00:29:57,610 --> 00:29:59,140

Golf shoes

498
00:30:07,490 --> 00:30:09,360
What has he won?!

499
00:30:09,480 --> 00:30:12,430
VHS player ♥

500
00:30:13,330 --> 00:30:16,270
He does the headbanging winning dance

501
00:30:18,010 --> 00:30:19,150
But

502
00:30:19,490 --> 00:30:22,980
"A VHS player alone is no good though..."

503
00:30:23,230 --> 00:30:24,650
That's right

504
00:30:24,700 --> 00:30:25,980
BUT!

505
00:30:27,090 --> 00:30:28,330
THAT'S RIGHT ♥

506
00:30:28,510 --> 00:30:30,800
I have a VHS player...

507
00:30:31,090 --> 00:30:33,790
I also have a TV so...

508
00:30:34,290 --> 00:30:36,370
"All I need now is a video tape!"

509
00:30:36,590 --> 00:30:39,050
Video library 2 tapes total!

510
00:30:39,580 --> 00:30:49,450
"For this whole 9 months I haven't seen any moving images, only still pictures. Either way I've not seen a single second of broadcast TV"

511
00:30:49,880 --> 00:30:53,800
Let's begin with watching the cycling race video

512
00:30:54,580 --> 00:30:57,630
Switch on!

513
00:30:59,770 --> 00:31:01,120
Uwaah! It's on!

514
00:31:01,300 --> 00:31:03,820
It's on, It's on, It's on, It's on, It's on, It's on, It's on, It's on, It's on,

515
00:31:03,870 --> 00:31:04,490
It's on!

516
00:31:04,490 --> 00:31:06,490
IT'S ON !!

517
00:31:10,890 --> 00:31:13,300
Nasubi dances to the BGM with excitement

518
00:31:18,250 --> 00:31:19,550
It's moving!

519
00:31:19,680 --> 00:31:22,040
It's MOVING!!

520
00:31:22,690 --> 00:31:27,440
After not seeing moving pictures for 10 months Nasubi is super excited!

521
00:31:28,290 --> 00:31:32,440
And next is the how to cure armpit odor video!

522
00:31:32,810 --> 00:31:33,870
Here we go

523
00:31:34,570 --> 00:31:37,070
Another exciting dance to the BGM from Nasubi

524
00:31:37,800 --> 00:31:39,530
Then...

525
00:31:39,770 --> 00:31:41,090
Oh!

526
00:31:41,320 --> 00:31:42,610
Oooh!!

527
00:31:42,850 --> 00:31:45,300
Moving women!

528
00:31:46,520 --> 00:31:48,990
It's been 10 months!

529
00:31:49,780 --> 00:31:54,740
After not seeing women for 10 months Nasubi is super excited!

530
00:31:55,390 --> 00:32:00,210
As shown in the illustration, it is thought that people who have dried earwax tend to have no armpit odor...

531
00:32:00,490 --> 00:32:05,210
Yet people with soft earwax seem to have body odor

532
00:32:06,940 --> 00:32:08,320
That's how it is

533
00:32:09,210 --> 00:32:12,450
With the additional house move, these are wins of October!

534
00:32:14,510 --> 00:32:18,600

My hair is getting pretty annoying

539
00:32:48,750 --> 00:32:52,080
He wants to do something about his long hair...

540
00:32:54,180 --> 00:33:01,470
It would be ideal if I could win a headband or even an elastic band...

541
00:33:01,570 --> 00:33:02,700
"However!"

542
00:33:02,800 --> 00:33:06,450
"Unexpectedly, a sudden flash of inspiration struck me!!"

543
00:33:07,580 --> 00:33:08,970
The outcome...

544
00:33:09,550 --> 00:33:10,830
Ai-in
TL: Ai-in is a 90's pop culture phrase coined by Ken Shimura who's comedy skits featured this gag hairstyle

545
00:33:11,370 --> 00:33:16,530
"I remembered that I won a sewing set and there was some elastic for panties in it!!"

546
00:33:16,590 --> 00:33:21,640
"So I tied it into a band and put my hair up with it!!"

547
00:33:22,010 --> 00:33:22,890
Nice ♥

548
00:33:23,320 --> 00:33:24,850
Body fat scales

549
00:33:24,110 --> 00:33:30,250
Possibly due to the new hair style, Nasubi is on a high pace winning streak!

550
00:33:24,850 --> 00:33:26,850
Leather belt

551
00:33:26,850 --> 00:33:30,210
Zatoichi phone card x3

552
00:33:32,760 --> 00:33:33,770
Sniff Sniff

553
00:33:36,820 --> 00:33:38,420
This smell !

554
00:33:38,510 --> 00:33:40,180
Could it be...

555
00:33:46,360 --> 00:33:47,970
This smell !!

556
00:33:48,210 --> 00:33:53,340
The king of all Autumn flavors Matsutake mushroom!
(The most expensive mushroom in Japan)

557
00:33:55,760 --> 00:33:57,690
Also 3 of them !!

558
00:34:03,860 --> 00:34:05,310
Let's take big bites!

559
00:34:04,890 --> 00:34:06,660
Toasted Matsutake

560
00:34:07,960 --> 00:34:11,680
Nasubi bites into Matsutake for the first time in his life!

561
00:34:31,560 --> 00:34:33,100
"This is serious!!"

562
00:34:33,130 --> 00:34:36,670
"The texture of the Matustake in my mouth is exceptional"

563
00:34:36,690 --> 00:34:40,500
"The delecate fragrance encompasses not only the mouth but also..."

564
00:34:40,540 --> 00:34:43,410
"Penetrates to the tip of the head, instantly sparking"

565
00:34:44,990 --> 00:34:47,470
"It's gone..."

566
00:34:50,240 --> 00:34:51,890
Yet another win!

567
00:34:52,620 --> 00:34:54,920
What did he win?!

568
00:34:56,010 --> 00:34:56,960
Oh?!

569
00:34:58,450 --> 00:34:59,940
This is...

570
00:35:01,050 --> 00:35:03,250
That's right

571
00:35:03,340 --> 00:35:05,450
This is it !

572
00:35:05,580 --> 00:35:11,540
Without this, I suffered many hardships...

573
00:35:11,610 --> 00:35:12,970
What's that...?

574
00:35:13,400 --> 00:35:16,120
Toilet paper ♥

575
00:35:18,730 --> 00:35:21,920
"Now I can poo whenever my heart desires!"

576
00:35:22,780 --> 00:35:26,020
It's really been 10 months....

577
00:35:26,080 --> 00:35:29,800
Since I've touched toilet paper

578
00:35:30,100 --> 00:35:32,210
Well then, well then...

579
00:35:32,890 --> 00:35:34,900
Let's give it a go shall we?

580
00:35:36,620 --> 00:35:38,110
Nasubi goes to the toilet...

581
00:35:38,170 --> 00:35:40,500
Is he having a poo?!

582
00:35:40,590 --> 00:35:47,520
It's been a long time since I have used the toilet paper holder

583
00:35:47,630 --> 00:35:50,240
10 months of troubles !

584
00:35:51,010 --> 00:35:55,390
Well then, let's shit! And give my ass a wipe ♥

585
00:35:56,930 --> 00:36:01,840
For the first time in TV history!
Mankind's toilet scene complete broadcast!

586
00:36:07,850 --> 00:36:08,620
But!

587
00:36:08,650 --> 00:36:11,600
No good, it's not coming out...

588
00:36:12,980 --> 00:36:15,790
"I look forward to the next time I poo ♥ "

589
00:36:21,200 --> 00:36:22,840
This is...

590
00:36:22,930 --> 00:36:24,670
Am I dreaming?

591
00:36:24,830 --> 00:36:27,570
Playstation ! (Real) ♥

592
00:36:27,870 --> 00:36:32,760
During Nasubi's prize life contest...

593
00:36:33,140 --> 00:36:35,260
It was around 8 months ago...

594
00:36:35,450 --> 00:36:37,610
Densha De GO!

595
00:36:37,610 --> 00:36:38,590
Plus!

596
00:36:38,640 --> 00:36:40,420
Special controller!

597
00:36:40,420 --> 00:36:41,460
And then!

598
00:36:41,560 --> 00:36:43,320
About 6 months ago...

599
00:36:43,420 --> 00:36:44,810
It's a TV ♥

600
00:36:45,780 --> 00:36:48,120
Nasubi has won what he needs!

601
00:36:48,320 --> 00:36:51,960
Prize life contest woooo- Wonerful ♥

602
00:36:52,660 --> 00:36:54,420
Uwaaahh! Here we go!

603
00:36:56,640 --> 00:36:58,380
Densha De GO!

604
00:36:58,380 --> 00:36:59,720
START!!

605
00:36:58,380 --> 00:36:59,780
Densha De GO!

606
00:36:59,880 --> 00:37:03,490
The train is departing! Amazing!

607
00:37:04,210 --> 00:37:07,090
"It's Densha De GO! Densha De GO!"

608
00:37:07,130 --> 00:37:11,380
"I forgot about time, myself, everything and played Densha De GO! Like a NEET!!

609
00:37:11,660 --> 00:37:13,320
As a result...

610
00:37:14,540 --> 00:37:16,340
He played all night.

611
00:37:19,020 --> 00:37:21,960
Nasubi is totally absorbed and plays nothing but the game.

612
00:37:24,720 --> 00:37:26,680
Once again the sun has set.

613
00:37:27,820 --> 00:37:29,170
"I'm..."

614
00:37:29,200 --> 00:37:31,370
"I'm a complete prisoner to Densha De GO!"

615
00:37:32,030 --> 00:37:33,960
As a result!

616
00:37:34,800 --> 00:37:36,020
He played all night.

617
00:37:36,690 --> 00:37:39,130
Entry into the 3rd day straight of Densha De GO!

618
00:37:40,740 --> 00:37:42,120
"I'm..."

619
00:37:42,140 --> 00:37:44,720
"I'm a complete slave to Densha De GO!"

620
00:37:47,450 --> 00:37:50,850
Just when will Nasubi stop playing Densha De GO!?

621
00:37:53,140 --> 00:37:55,180
That was pretty good just then

622
00:37:56,380 --> 00:37:57,680
At that time!

623
00:37:57,720 --> 00:37:59,280
But you know...

624
00:38:00,050 --> 00:38:02,660
"What the heck am I doing?"

625
00:38:02,720 --> 00:38:05,260
"Then I decided."

626
00:38:06,720 --> 00:38:09,370
Playstation BAN

627
00:38:09,920 --> 00:38:12,450
I realised this is a bad situation!

628
00:38:12,720 --> 00:38:15,610
It's certainly very fun but...

629
00:38:16,040 --> 00:38:17,810
Densha De GO!

630
00:38:23,370 --> 00:38:25,380
"I'll stop from tomorrow."

631
00:38:26,320 --> 00:38:30,480
Since the Playstation BAN he has made great progress towards the goal.

632
00:38:27,420 --> 00:38:28,730
Mayonnaise

633
00:38:29,090 --> 00:38:30,280
10kg rice

634
00:38:30,400 --> 00:38:32,650
Hair growth tonic

635
00:38:33,170 --> 00:38:36,020
Today, he wins something like that thing 6 months ago!

636
00:38:38,440 --> 00:38:41,200
When Nasubi saw it...

637
00:38:43,740 --> 00:38:47,100
The most surprised face since the start of prize life contest!

638
00:38:48,820 --> 00:38:50,360
It's here!

639
00:38:51,340 --> 00:38:52,860
It's here!!!!!!!!!!!

640
00:38:52,970 --> 00:38:54,200
What is it?!

641
00:38:56,140 --> 00:38:58,440
It's meat ♥

642
00:38:59,400 --> 00:39:04,560
In June he won duck breasts, the first meat in half a year!

643
00:39:04,750 --> 00:39:08,130
But really, it looks very high grade...

644
00:39:08,860 --> 00:39:11,130
"Cow meat!!"

645
00:39:11,390 --> 00:39:12,610
Certainly...

646
00:39:13,020 --> 00:39:16,210
These are steak cuts ♥

647
00:39:17,050 --> 00:39:18,700
Grilling.

648
00:39:20,180 --> 00:39:23,900
It's been 6 months since the smell of cooked meat...

649
00:39:24,980 --> 00:39:26,940
Ahhh~ it's great!

650
00:39:27,860 --> 00:39:29,170
It's cooked.

651
00:39:29,480 --> 00:39:32,370
Look, check out how thick this steak is!

652
00:39:33,940 --> 00:39:34,810
But then!

653
00:39:36,090 --> 00:39:38,090
Fuckfuckfuck I dropped it...

654
00:39:40,920 --> 00:39:42,040
Nevertheless...

655
00:39:42,200 --> 00:39:43,080
Let's eat

656
00:39:43,530 --> 00:39:45,280
Nasubi isn't fazed by it.

657
00:39:45,730 --> 00:39:49,370
But you know what, I have this luxury cutlery...

658
00:39:49,440 --> 00:39:53,860
Just biting into it like this right here...
Wouldn't be very entertaining...

659
00:39:53,940 --> 00:39:55,220
So...

660
00:39:56,050 --> 00:40:00,180
Using the towel as a napkin, and the potato crisp bag as a plate...

661
00:40:00,530 --> 00:40:03,960
We shall dine with formal etiquette

662
00:40:05,690 --> 00:40:08,760
Some suitable BGM for this situation would be a classic piece...

663
00:40:08,900 --> 00:40:11,660
Hey maestro! Start the music.

664
00:40:12,250 --> 00:40:14,890
Vivaldi's 4 seasons

665
00:40:13,500 --> 00:40:15,480
We shall dine!

666
00:40:20,290 --> 00:40:23,090
How is the flavor of meat for the first time in 6 months?!

667
00:40:27,240 --> 00:40:29,680
Delicious!

668
00:40:30,490 --> 00:40:34,540
He begins to shed tears of joy

669
00:40:35,320 --> 00:40:36,740
The next day

670
00:40:38,250 --> 00:40:39,180
Another win today!

671
00:40:40,500 --> 00:40:44,290
Oh! This is a quite a heavy item I've won

672
00:40:44,480 --> 00:40:49,450
A pear, an apple or even a potato...
That will make me very happy

673
00:40:51,090 --> 00:40:51,970
Then

674
00:40:53,010 --> 00:40:54,940
Nasubi laughs.

675
00:40:54,980 --> 00:40:56,500
Another food item?!

676
00:41:01,130 --> 00:41:02,840
What do you think it is?

677
00:41:02,860 --> 00:41:04,440
This is...

678
00:41:05,000 --> 00:41:07,600
It's my tent ♥

679
00:41:08,110 --> 00:41:09,440
It's so spacious !

680
00:41:09,440 --> 00:41:10,440
Look

681
00:41:10,440 --> 00:41:12,140
Amazing space!

682
00:41:12,540 --> 00:41:15,570
With all this space... I could live in it!

683
00:41:15,760 --> 00:41:16,970
So...

684
00:41:17,690 --> 00:41:19,220
This is nice ♥

685
00:41:19,260 --> 00:41:22,140
Prize life contest in a tent START!

686
00:41:23,620 --> 00:41:27,020
An exceptional month of November with these wins

687
00:41:30,140 --> 00:41:34,730
Until the 1 million Yen goal, another 161,886円 remains!

688
00:41:36,420 --> 00:41:39,000
Nasubi in December.

689
00:41:41,370 --> 00:41:44,930
These are the entries for December

690
00:41:49,090 --> 00:41:52,170
A total of 2,546 entries

691
00:41:52,740 --> 00:41:56,250
Morning

692
00:42:06,250 --> 00:42:12,690
Nasubi is living in the tent now, however he still continues to relentlessly write postcards out. Nothing has changed.

693
00:42:13,980 --> 00:42:15,380
Then...

694
00:42:17,210 --> 00:42:20,460
Could it be the tent life prize contest first ever prize?!

695
00:42:21,340 --> 00:42:23,890
Is it the explosive power of the tent?!

696
00:42:23,970 --> 00:42:25,440
However...

697
00:42:27,640 --> 00:42:30,410
Any prize is a good prize but...

698
00:42:30,460 --> 00:42:32,720
He doesn't seem very pleased...

699
00:42:32,720 --> 00:42:34,370
What did he receive?

700
00:42:34,730 --> 00:42:36,120
What's this??

701
00:42:36,650 --> 00:42:37,720
In a tube.

702
00:42:38,480 --> 00:42:41,660
It feels like a paper item again...

703
00:42:42,490 --> 00:42:48,530
Paper prizes.
Worthless prizes that only lead Nasubi into great depression

704
00:42:51,060 --> 00:42:53,440
He anxiously opens it

705
00:42:54,050 --> 00:42:57,240
What popped out before Nasubi's eyes?!

706
00:43:02,540 --> 00:43:05,730
Nasubi bingo! Bingo !! BINGO !!!

707
00:43:05,810 --> 00:43:07,370
What did he win?!

708
00:43:07,410 --> 00:43:12,090
I won Ryoko Hirosue 1999 calender ! ♥

709
00:43:12,290 --> 00:43:14,420
He goes to do the winning dance!

710
00:43:14,610 --> 00:43:15,330
BUT!

711
00:43:17,600 --> 00:43:20,000
"There is no space to dance..."

712
00:43:20,520 --> 00:43:21,800
So...

713
00:43:22,930 --> 00:43:24,620
Tent life is finished.

714
00:43:24,680 --> 00:43:27,760
The room is back to it's normal feel

715
00:43:27,900 --> 00:43:29,660
Then...

716
00:43:30,380 --> 00:43:33,760
This time a winning dance

717
00:43:36,460 --> 00:43:42,920
Next year, for a whole year, I can live together with Miss Hirosue

718
00:43:43,180 --> 00:43:46,060
There is already hype for next years prize life contest!

719
00:43:46,890 --> 00:43:52,100
Surrounded by 3 Miss Hirosue, Nasubi's prize life is in pretty good shape!

720
00:43:47,840 --> 00:43:49,060

Reinforced suitcase

723
00:43:52,400 --> 00:43:53,660
Just then!

724
00:43:55,600 --> 00:43:57,780
Yet another win?

725
00:43:57,840 --> 00:43:59,140
However...

726
00:43:59,640 --> 00:44:01,240
"What the heck are you?!"

727
00:44:01,290 --> 00:44:04,180
"Just why in the world are you here?!"

728
00:44:08,580 --> 00:44:10,380
What's going on!??

729
00:44:13,010 --> 00:44:14,520
It's a tire ♥

730
00:44:15,280 --> 00:44:18,060
Four wheel drive Nasubi ♥

731
00:44:19,450 --> 00:44:23,660
"Dear lord! You were out by just one letter! If only it was 'Daiya'."
TL: Taiya = Tire, Daiya = Diamond

732
00:44:23,660 --> 00:44:27,120
"That would have been the finale of my prize life contest for sure?!"

733
00:44:27,170 --> 00:44:30,220
"But... My dreams are only dreams..."

734
00:44:32,020 --> 00:44:33,290
However!

735
00:44:33,330 --> 00:44:36,740
Right at this moment the staff realise a very serious situation!

736
00:44:37,170 --> 00:44:40,680
This 4 tire win is worth 84,000円

737
00:44:40,960 --> 00:44:45,560
In other words, the total prize earnings are 969,114円

738
00:44:46,090 --> 00:44:50,880
To reach the 1 million Yen goal, all that remains is 30,886円 !!

739
00:44:51,090 --> 00:44:54,420
The goal is right in front of Nasubi's eyes!

740
00:44:54,720 --> 00:44:56,530
And then after this...

741
00:44:57,800 --> 00:44:59,980
Finally reached the goal?!

742
00:45:00,210 --> 00:45:02,050
What did he win?!

743
00:45:03,260 --> 00:45:10,060
Nationwide department store 10,000円 gift voucher!

744
00:45:11,280 --> 00:45:12,620
Getting close!

745
00:45:13,640 --> 00:45:16,580
From here the count down to the goal begins!

746
00:45:16,780 --> 00:45:21,280
A photo album of Antonio Inoki ♥

747
00:45:25,570 --> 00:45:29,200
By the way, the price of this photo album is 10,000円

748
00:45:29,610 --> 00:45:31,570
The sound of the approaching goal!

749
00:45:32,600 --> 00:45:34,660
Gold balls ♥

750
00:45:35,530 --> 00:45:38,660
The value of golf balls is... 4,800円

751
00:45:39,090 --> 00:45:42,690
Until the goal another 6,086円 remains!

752
00:45:43,920 --> 00:45:45,540
A pan! ♥

753
00:45:46,200 --> 00:45:49,020
The price of this pan is 5,000円

754
00:45:50,160 --> 00:45:51,450
So close!

755
00:45:52,800 --> 00:45:55,620
Rice topping seasoning ♥

756
00:45:55,660 --> 00:45:57,620
Has he done it?!

757
00:46:00,320 --> 00:46:01,880
500円 value.

758
00:46:03,240 --> 00:46:05,400
!

759
00:46:05,650 --> 00:46:08,770
And so that moment has finally come.

760
00:46:12,580 --> 00:46:15,920
Yes, yes, yes something came today too!

761
00:46:22,180 --> 00:46:23,130
Oh!

762
00:46:23,380 --> 00:46:24,370
It's here.

763
00:46:24,380 --> 00:46:27,770
White, shiny, troublesome!

764
00:46:27,820 --> 00:46:29,780
What did he win?!

765
00:46:31,330 --> 00:46:33,360
I won some rice ♥

766
00:46:33,920 --> 00:46:36,770
What's the value? 750円

767
00:46:37,000 --> 00:46:38,340
So that means...

768
00:46:39,010 --> 00:46:42,840
The total prize winning value is 1,000,164円

769
00:46:43,020 --> 00:46:44,400
And that means!

770
00:46:44,480 --> 00:46:49,770
The 1 million Yen goal has been reached
and the prize life contest is over!

771
00:46:50,770 --> 00:46:54,760
The one man who's fate was to open the winning ticket

772
00:46:54,760 --> 00:46:59,080
He started from zero, completely naked

773
00:46:59,160 --> 00:47:02,420
With only a endless supply of postcards.

774
00:47:02,420 --> 00:47:05,080
During that endless eternity of time

775
00:47:05,180 --> 00:47:08,700
That man only had one goal in sight

776
00:47:08,760 --> 00:47:12,290
And now that special moment is finally here

777
00:47:12,660 --> 00:47:19,650
It took 335 days to do, but for the first time in human history a man has completed this unprecedented savage challenge.

778
00:47:20,010 --> 00:47:23,010
So we have come to a conclusion

779
00:47:23,010 --> 00:47:24,260
That is...

780
00:47:24,650 --> 00:47:27,720
People CAN live by only winning prize contests!

781
00:47:28,300 --> 00:47:29,760
But Nasubi...

782
00:47:30,570 --> 00:47:32,680
Ok! I'm gonna give it my best!

783
00:47:33,180 --> 00:47:35,180
He's writing out postcards!

784
00:47:35,370 --> 00:47:36,560
FUCK!

785
00:47:37,090 --> 00:47:39,980
Nasubi hasn't realised he's reached the goal!

786
00:47:40,010 --> 00:47:41,460
We have to tell him!

787
00:47:41,820 --> 00:47:42,820
So...

788
00:47:43,660 --> 00:47:45,330
That night

789
00:47:47,040 --> 00:47:49,120
The producer appears

790
00:47:50,620 --> 00:47:53,770
It's time to tell Nasubi he reached the goal...

791
00:47:54,320 --> 00:47:57,730
This time the producer has brought something along...

792
00:48:08,690 --> 00:48:10,730
That = Party popper

793
00:48:18,200 --> 00:48:20,570
The goal celebration is confetti blessings

794
00:48:22,780 --> 00:48:24,340
But Nasubi...

795
00:48:25,210 --> 00:48:26,840
What's going on?

796
00:48:27,380 --> 00:48:29,640
He doesn't get it at all.

797
00:48:36,250 --> 00:48:38,650
The producer continues the blessing ♥

798
00:48:41,840 --> 00:48:42,720
Get it?

799
00:48:42,850 --> 00:48:44,820
I don't understand

800
00:48:44,880 --> 00:48:45,730
What's this?

801
00:48:45,880 --> 00:48:47,660
Party popper...

802
00:48:47,890 --> 00:48:49,260
Correct!

803
00:48:50,680 --> 00:48:53,440
I understand it's a party popper ok...

804
00:48:54,760 --> 00:48:56,520
When are they used?

805
00:48:58,220 --> 00:49:01,020
I guess when you want to congratulate someone...

806
00:49:01,210 --> 00:49:02,560
Super correct!

807
00:49:05,370 --> 00:49:07,130
Then perhaps...

808
00:49:11,300 --> 00:49:13,650
I made a million yen?

809
00:49:13,720 --> 00:49:15,020
Super Super Correct!

810
00:49:16,050 --> 00:49:21,130
Huh? Wait a sec, hold on, hold on, excuse me...

811
00:49:23,330 --> 00:49:24,780
For real?

812
00:49:25,120 --> 00:49:27,770
Really, truly, honestly, for real?

813
00:49:28,180 --> 00:49:29,200
Yep!

814
00:49:32,730 --> 00:49:34,130
I did it!

815
00:49:35,340 --> 00:49:39,940
Denpa Shounen prize life contest Nasubi GOAL !!

816
00:49:41,790 --> 00:49:43,100
Congratulations!

817
00:49:50,480 --> 00:49:52,020
Then the producer...

818
00:49:56,980 --> 00:49:57,730
Get it?

819
00:49:57,730 --> 00:49:58,780
Yes!

820
00:49:58,970 --> 00:50:04,290
11 months and one day ago I got naked.
Their my clothes right?

821
00:50:04,620 --> 00:50:06,970
It all began with this talk.

822
00:50:07,200 --> 00:50:08,290
Strip ♥

823
00:50:10,450 --> 00:50:15,160
11 months ago, without this pre-requisite we would never have been able to start

824
00:50:15,260 --> 00:50:17,080
11 months and 1 day ago confiscation of clothes

825
00:50:18,730 --> 00:50:19,980
Can I ?

826
00:50:19,980 --> 00:50:21,140
Yep!

827
00:50:22,690 --> 00:50:25,690
The return of clothes

828
00:50:26,620 --> 00:50:28,290
Thank you for everything

829
00:50:30,050 --> 00:50:31,770
It's the real deal!

830
00:50:32,470 --> 00:50:34,080
We'll be outside

831
00:50:34,850 --> 00:50:39,080
Nasubi... Pants... Here we go!

832
00:50:39,730 --> 00:50:47,370
This is the moment he wears pants and is re-certified as a member of modern society after 11 months!

833
00:50:49,340 --> 00:50:51,720
First is the right leg

834
00:50:58,130 --> 00:51:00,530
The left leg follows

835
00:51:02,300 --> 00:51:05,650
All that's left is to pull them up now!

836
00:51:06,720 --> 00:51:12,860
This is the last farewell to the Nasubi mark!

837
00:51:17,400 --> 00:51:21,050
Pants installation complete!

838
00:51:22,090 --> 00:51:24,620
These are my socks!

839
00:51:24,620 --> 00:51:29,900
From here Nasubi takes great pleasure in getting dressed one item at a time

840
00:51:33,560 --> 00:51:36,380
And when he has finished getting dressed...

841
00:51:37,130 --> 00:51:38,810
The morning has come.

842
00:51:38,880 --> 00:51:40,920
I finally made it!

843
00:51:41,320 --> 00:51:42,620
However...

844
00:51:43,180 --> 00:51:46,610
After this Nasubi's body has a wierd reaction...

845
00:51:47,680 --> 00:51:50,240
... It's kinda itchy.

846
00:51:50,240 --> 00:51:51,570
So...

847
00:51:52,400 --> 00:51:54,960
Yeah, actually this feels the best ♥

848
00:51:52,780 --> 00:51:55,010
Nasubi mark revival

849
00:51:56,800 --> 00:51:58,800
Naked.

850
00:51:59,200 --> 00:52:03,620
A plethora of presents awaited for Nasubi as a congratulation

852
00:52:06,360 --> 00:52:09,040
It's Ramen ♥

853
00:52:09,660 --> 00:52:12,840
The food he wanted to eat first was Roast pork Ramen

854
00:52:12,920 --> 00:52:16,080
It's the intense flavor he desired for 11 months

855
00:52:17,540 --> 00:52:18,400
It's great!

856
00:52:18,500 --> 00:52:20,100

What comes to mind?

859
00:52:27,700 --> 00:52:28,780
Grilled meat.

860
00:52:28,960 --> 00:52:30,010
Correct ♥

861
00:52:30,500 --> 00:52:34,480
Prize diary last year on page 1998.11.13

862
00:52:36,500 --> 00:52:38,570
"I wanna eat grilled meat!"

863
00:52:38,740 --> 00:52:41,460
You even remember those kind of details...

864
00:52:41,660 --> 00:52:42,780
Thank you.

865
00:52:43,600 --> 00:52:46,720
A second gift from the home of grilled meats, Korea.

866
00:52:47,440 --> 00:52:52,780

868
00:52:56,040 --> 00:52:57,860
Take off the mask!

869
00:52:58,680 --> 00:52:59,890
Just as I thought...

870
00:53:05,620 --> 00:53:07,760
The Amusement park.

871
00:53:07,880 --> 00:53:11,840
Nasubi's carefree enjoyment is a complete knockout!

872
00:53:13,840 --> 00:53:15,960
Prize life contest celebration BONUS!

873
00:53:19,170 --> 00:53:20,300
Shopping

874
00:53:20,680 --> 00:53:24,100
Those are Korean market Kimchi pots.

875
00:53:24,810 --> 00:53:28,800
However, these are preparation for a new film production...

876
00:53:29,290 --> 00:53:31,210
Here, the producer...

877
00:53:31,300 --> 00:53:32,680
Where are we staying?

878
00:53:32,680 --> 00:53:33,130
Huh?

879
00:53:33,130 --> 00:53:34,380
Where are we staying?

880
00:53:35,060 --> 00:53:37,060
Eyemask

881
00:53:35,060 --> 00:53:37,060

Departure by car.

884
00:53:38,620 --> 00:53:40,620
After a 5 hour drive...

885
00:53:41,720 --> 00:53:43,600
We finally arrive.

886
00:53:43,850 --> 00:53:47,700
Well... Please take off the eyemask

887
00:53:50,610 --> 00:53:52,130
Where are they?

888
00:53:54,480 --> 00:53:56,220
Kimichi

889
00:53:59,540 --> 00:54:00,340

891
00:54:07,800 --> 00:54:14,330
Can people live in Korea by only winning prizes?

892
00:54:14,780 --> 00:54:17,500
Nasubi suffers massive shock

893
00:54:18,090 --> 00:54:22,450
But the producers words have moved Nasubi's heart!

894
00:54:23,120 --> 00:54:27,460
But this time, the goal isn't 1 million Yen

895
00:54:27,980 --> 00:54:32,980
This time the goal is... To get to Japan by plane

896
00:54:33,080 --> 00:54:34,290
A one way ticket

897
00:54:34,690 --> 00:54:36,260
Then...

898
00:54:37,160 --> 00:54:38,650
I'm naked again ♥

899
00:54:39,380 --> 00:54:40,920

If you don't want to do it, just say.

901
00:54:42,080 --> 00:54:43,620
I want to do it!

902
00:54:43,770 --> 00:54:47,660
Can people live in Korea by only winning prizes?

903
00:54:44,730 --> 00:54:47,680

And earn 46,900円 worth of prizes to get from Seoul to Tokyo (Economy class)

908
00:54:59,570 --> 00:55:03,130

00:55:30,160 --> 00:55:33,320
This is the first time I've tried to write in Korean...

914
00:55:33,420 --> 00:55:35,840
I have no idea about it really.

915
00:55:36,040 --> 00:55:38,840
Nasubi struggles to write out Hangul characters

916
00:55:38,960 --> 00:55:40,680
Then...

917
00:55:41,290 --> 00:55:44,540
Isn't it dinner time soon?

918
00:55:44,860 --> 00:55:46,850
Simple Kimchi dish

919
00:55:46,610 --> 00:55:48,220
Looks good doesn't it

920
00:55:48,490 --> 00:55:51,900
Kimichi dinner time

921
00:56:03,080 --> 00:56:06,540
To ration, he eats 3 pieces of Kimchi

922
00:56:07,660 --> 00:56:11,170
And this is all he eats for a whole day.

923
00:56:11,820 --> 00:56:13,300
Lid from pot

924
00:56:13,480 --> 00:56:17,130
"Korea, the home of Kimichi. It's great!!"

925
00:56:18,140 --> 00:56:20,330
A fue days have passed

926
00:56:20,770 --> 00:56:23,130
Nasubi again writes postcards all day today

927
00:56:23,650 --> 00:56:26,920
He is still slow paced, but takes great care.

928
00:56:28,330 --> 00:56:31,780
But there is one thing that worries him

929
00:56:31,780 --> 00:56:33,130
That is...

930
00:56:33,130 --> 00:56:36,180
I wonder if these will really be delivered...

931
00:56:36,760 --> 00:56:43,460
"I wonder if the Korean postal service and everyone involved in the prize contest can really..."

932
00:56:43,520 --> 00:56:46,860
"Can they read my crappy Hangul writing?
I'm very concerned..."

933
00:56:47,900 --> 00:56:53,040
After this, a lovely nostalgic sound pays a vist to Nasubi's room.

934
00:56:54,930 --> 00:56:56,500
What's this sound?!

935
00:56:57,220 --> 00:57:04,090
During the prize life contest in Japan, that was the depressing sound of worthless paper post

936
00:57:04,420 --> 00:57:06,130
But Nasubi...

937
00:57:06,540 --> 00:57:07,930
Oh?

938
00:57:08,970 --> 00:57:10,400
What was that?

939
00:57:11,100 --> 00:57:12,900
The sound came from the entrance!

940
00:57:13,300 --> 00:57:16,170
He didn't notice that it was the same sound

941
00:57:17,820 --> 00:57:19,360
This is!

942
00:57:19,820 --> 00:57:23,320
Judging from Nasubi's delight, could it possibly not be paper post?

943
00:57:23,740 --> 00:57:25,170
However...

944
00:57:25,930 --> 00:57:27,840
It's paper.

945
00:57:28,440 --> 00:57:31,170
It's here! Something came!

946
00:57:32,400 --> 00:57:35,050
Considering all the paper prizes where worth 0 Yen...

947
00:57:35,090 --> 00:57:39,000
Has he forgotten the Demon that is paper post?!

948
00:57:40,020 --> 00:57:42,000
I got some post! ♥

949
00:57:42,490 --> 00:57:45,450
But what is inside?

950
00:57:50,220 --> 00:57:52,100
Some kind of paper...

951
00:57:52,150 --> 00:57:54,640
Probably notification that you did not win.

952
00:57:54,690 --> 00:57:57,540
Perhaps it says, perhaps perhaps I don't know maybe

953
00:57:57,690 --> 00:57:59,850
And this is...

954
00:58:02,650 --> 00:58:04,720
"Catalog"

955
00:58:04,720 --> 00:58:06,720
Then Nasubi...

956
00:58:06,720 --> 00:58:08,490
It's a catalog! ♥

957
00:58:08,560 --> 00:58:09,320
Yay!

958
00:58:09,360 --> 00:58:11,500
He is still pleased.

959
00:58:11,540 --> 00:58:12,870
And also...

960
00:58:13,970 --> 00:58:16,080
A winning dance!

961
00:58:16,530 --> 00:58:20,170
Why is this man pleased to the extent that he will dance?

962
00:58:21,100 --> 00:58:24,420
Listen carefully here to Nasubi's words...

963
00:58:25,480 --> 00:58:33,090
This is proof that my postcard got delivered! ♥

964
00:58:33,650 --> 00:58:37,520
"It doesn't even matter about what I get..."

965
00:58:37,570 --> 00:58:42,770
"As long as there is a response from the postcards,
I know they are arriving through the post!"

966
00:58:42,820 --> 00:58:47,010
"That is far more important, valuable, wonderful and beautiful!!!"

967
00:58:47,570 --> 00:58:51,290
My head is in the zone for writing postcards now!

968
00:58:51,770 --> 00:58:53,240
And the next day

969
00:58:53,920 --> 00:58:57,340
Today the moment he's been waiting for finally comes

970
00:59:01,440 --> 00:59:03,200
Delivery

971
00:59:03,200 --> 00:59:04,010
Oh!!

972
00:59:04,010 --> 00:59:08,000
"Finally its time! The time has come!"

973
00:59:08,200 --> 00:59:10,640
A package... for me?

974
00:59:10,780 --> 00:59:11,800
Please sign

975
00:59:11,880 --> 00:59:15,410
I have to sign! Er, um.. ok ...

976
00:59:16,200 --> 00:59:17,320
Sign here please

977
00:59:19,800 --> 00:59:22,400
감사합니다 (Thank you very much)

978
00:59:28,570 --> 00:59:30,720
"I won something!"

979
00:59:30,770 --> 00:59:34,380
"Today's prize is rewarding in more ways than one!"

980
00:59:36,060 --> 00:59:40,170
This time its a real package delivery! ♥

981
00:59:42,280 --> 00:59:45,300
So overjoyed there is no need to look inside. Just dance.

982
00:59:45,880 --> 00:59:49,240
"I've been waiting and waiting and waiting forever!!"

983
00:59:49,320 --> 00:59:53,440
"Prize life contest in Korea official prize number 1 !!"

984
00:59:54,060 --> 00:59:56,010
Yes!

985
00:59:56,770 --> 00:59:58,570
I'm winning for real now

986
00:59:59,940 --> 01:00:01,700
I'm getting real deliveries

987
01:00:04,740 --> 01:00:08,010
Although he doesn't even know what he's won yet

988
01:00:08,010 --> 01:00:12,440
Just the fact its been delivered is making him explode with joy.

989
01:00:20,260 --> 01:00:21,420
What is it?

990
01:00:21,560 --> 01:00:23,560
Just what is inside?

991
01:00:23,720 --> 01:00:26,020
What's inside? What's gonna come out?

992
01:00:26,850 --> 01:00:28,120
Ta-da! ♥

993
01:00:34,410 --> 01:00:35,840
Huh?!

994
01:00:45,200 --> 01:00:47,010
What's inside?

995
01:00:47,500 --> 01:00:50,610
It's Kimchi ♥

996
01:00:50,930 --> 01:00:58,980
Mr.Kimchi, I'm Nasubi. I already have some Kimichi, I eat it.

997
01:00:59,040 --> 01:01:00,960
What are you for Kimchi?

998
01:01:00,960 --> 01:01:02,560
But

999
01:01:03,100 --> 01:01:04,480
Kimchi just won

1000
01:01:03,960 --> 01:01:05,770
Let's eat ♥

1001
01:01:07,090 --> 01:01:09,170
Eating.

1002
01:01:12,530 --> 01:01:14,210
Then...

1003
01:01:14,850 --> 01:01:15,800
It's great!

1004
01:01:17,060 --> 01:01:19,460
Nasubi in February and March (1999)

1005
01:01:21,820 --> 01:01:24,420
These are the entries for February and March

1006
01:01:43,920 --> 01:01:46,890
A total of 4,616 entries.

1007
01:01:47,060 --> 01:01:48,280
I did it!

1008
01:01:48,330 --> 01:01:51,480
First prize
Kimichi

1009
01:01:51,580 --> 01:01:52,930
From here...

1010
01:01:53,080 --> 01:01:59,680
I will start the countdown for the journey home!

1011
01:01:59,870 --> 01:02:01,660
Just you wait Tokyo!

1012
01:02:01,970 --> 01:02:03,180
Just you wait!!

1013
01:02:03,570 --> 01:02:04,700
TV

1014
01:02:04,050 --> 01:02:09,130
The plane ticket home goal prize life contest in Korea is progressing nicely with winnings.

1015
01:02:05,050 --> 01:02:06,180
Grill wire

1016
01:02:06,220 --> 01:02:07,650
Wool panties

1017
01:02:07,970 --> 01:02:09,560
Millet

1018
01:02:12,450 --> 01:02:14,000
Mute the TV

1019
01:02:15,560 --> 01:02:17,130
Then...

1020
01:02:17,510 --> 01:02:19,010
Oh! It's heavy...

1021
01:02:19,040 --> 01:02:20,490
Heavy!?

1022
01:02:20,660 --> 01:02:23,690
It's not as heavy as the TV box but...

1023
01:02:23,730 --> 01:02:27,140
This is still pretty big you know!

1024
01:02:28,760 --> 01:02:33,170
It could be another electrical item with this weight... ♥

1025
01:02:33,700 --> 01:02:36,780
After the TV what is the 2nd electrical goods prize?!

1026
01:02:37,410 --> 01:02:41,740
Surely... If this was another electrical prize...

1027
01:02:42,690 --> 01:02:45,560
Wouldn't we have exceeded the goal?

1028
01:02:45,760 --> 01:02:48,470
I could go back to Japan right?

1029
01:02:48,960 --> 01:02:50,650
What's in this box...?

1030
01:02:51,110 --> 01:02:52,490
What is it?

1031
01:02:52,490 --> 01:02:53,760
WHAT??

1032
01:02:53,900 --> 01:02:55,840
The contents are...

1033
01:02:58,060 --> 01:03:01,240
Oh! There is bubble wrap packaging...

1034
01:03:01,370 --> 01:03:02,980
Bubble wrap?!

1035
01:03:03,220 --> 01:03:06,220
These are high precision instruments!

1036
01:03:06,400 --> 01:03:09,100
Expectations are rising for an electrical prize!

1037
01:03:10,540 --> 01:03:12,130
But

1038
01:03:14,440 --> 01:03:16,260
This has come?!

1039
01:03:16,530 --> 01:03:18,720
It was different than expected.

1040
01:03:20,680 --> 01:03:22,690
This is different, but good!

1041
01:03:22,690 --> 01:03:24,370
What?!

1042
01:03:24,810 --> 01:03:26,610
I knew it

1043
01:03:26,880 --> 01:03:29,200
Just what did he win?

1044
01:03:29,570 --> 01:03:31,680
Ohh~~~hohoho...

1045
01:03:32,250 --> 01:03:34,780
What could it be for Nasubi to make such a strange voice?!

1046
01:03:36,200 --> 01:03:38,740
Bananas ♥

1047
01:03:38,920 --> 01:03:40,370
And what's more...

1048
01:03:40,500 --> 01:03:43,620
A box, a whole box of them!

1049
01:03:43,700 --> 01:03:47,930
It's banana... Banana !!

1050
01:03:49,980 --> 01:03:52,540
I told you, this is a banana!

1051
01:03:52,930 --> 01:03:56,690
But right now Nasubi is in a serious situation...

1052
01:03:58,080 --> 01:04:00,250
By the way, right now his prize earnings are...

1053
01:04:00,320 --> 01:04:01,680
45,300 Yen

1054
01:04:02,180 --> 01:04:04,580
To reach the 46,900 Yen goal he needs

1055
01:04:04,580 --> 01:04:06,200
Another 1,600 Yen

1056
01:04:06,860 --> 01:04:10,130
The value of these banana is 2,500 Yen
(10 bunches=25,000 Won / 1Yen=10Won)

1057
01:04:10,180 --> 01:04:11,520
So that means...

1058
01:04:12,140 --> 01:04:14,850
His total earnings are up to 47,800 Yen

1059
01:04:14,960 --> 01:04:16,220
So, that means!!

1060
01:04:16,220 --> 01:04:21,620
The goal of 46,900円 has been reached
Prize life contest in KOREA complete.

1061
01:04:22,320 --> 01:04:25,090
That's right! Nasubi has reached the goal...

1062
01:04:26,690 --> 01:04:27,460
BUT!

1063
01:04:28,200 --> 01:04:30,700
Eating a banana he starts writing postcards!

1064
01:04:30,700 --> 01:04:33,050
Nasubi hasn't realised he reached the goal!

1065
01:04:33,090 --> 01:04:35,050
We have to tell him quickly!!

1066
01:04:35,640 --> 01:04:37,200
However...

1067
01:04:37,260 --> 01:04:42,130
Eating and searching a dictonary... What, what a happy feeling.

1068
01:04:42,160 --> 01:04:43,400
It's great ♥

1069
01:04:43,640 --> 01:04:47,620
After seeing Nasubi's determination, the staff thought that...

1070
01:04:48,480 --> 01:04:55,050
From Seoul to Tokyo the plane ticket is 46,900円 in Economy class

1071
01:04:55,570 --> 01:04:59,220
After trying so hard, economy class is just not good enough.

1072
01:04:59,890 --> 01:05:01,440
So...

1073
01:05:02,690 --> 01:05:04,760
Rank up to Business class!

1074
01:05:04,840 --> 01:05:06,060
So that means!

1075
01:05:06,490 --> 01:05:09,330
We also rank up the goal price! (57,300円)

1076
01:05:09,500 --> 01:05:10,880
So that means!

1077
01:05:10,930 --> 01:05:13,180
Untill the new goal he needs another...

1078
01:05:13,460 --> 01:05:15,180
9,500円

1079
01:05:15,620 --> 01:05:18,500
Good luck Nasubi!

1080
01:05:19,340 --> 01:05:20,880
The next day

1081
01:05:22,260 --> 01:05:26,540
To get the business class ticket, he is again eating and writing entries.

1082
01:05:27,360 --> 01:05:28,660
Then...

1083
01:05:31,440 --> 01:05:33,410
Is it a win?

1084
01:05:35,600 --> 01:05:37,450
It's a win !

1085
01:05:38,420 --> 01:05:39,770
Shall we open it?

1086
01:05:40,280 --> 01:05:42,220
What could be inside?

1087
01:05:42,480 --> 01:05:45,570
Its Tea ♥

1088
01:05:47,130 --> 01:05:48,660
But Nasubi...

1089
01:05:48,920 --> 01:05:55,280
But you know... It's only tea, just 2 small bags of tea leaf...

1090
01:05:55,700 --> 01:06:03,000
"At fist glance my thoughts are that it seems this is not very expensive, high quality Tea leaf!"

1091
01:06:03,210 --> 01:06:05,810
The goal is still plenty far away huh...

1092
01:06:05,860 --> 01:06:10,130
Tea, no matter what, this stuff can't really help...

1093
01:06:10,850 --> 01:06:12,570
This is trivia time.

1094
01:06:13,130 --> 01:06:17,700
The tea that Nasubi received was from the
famous Korean Shinroan region

1095
01:06:17,940 --> 01:06:22,020
This is the most expensive tea in Korea, the Ujeon variety.

1096
01:06:22,680 --> 01:06:26,120
The unrealized price of this tea is 14,000円 !
(2bags 200g =140,000 Won 1 Yen = 10 Won)

1097
01:06:26,250 --> 01:06:27,620
So that means!

1098
01:06:28,130 --> 01:06:30,650
Total prize earnings are 61,800円

1099
01:06:30,900 --> 01:06:32,240
So that means!

1100
01:06:32,840 --> 01:06:37,880
The goal of 57,300円 has been reached
Prize life contest in KOREA complete.

1101
01:06:38,500 --> 01:06:41,620
Nasubi's reached the GOAL !!

1102
01:06:42,140 --> 01:06:42,920
But !!

1103
01:06:43,620 --> 01:06:44,290
Kimchi pot lid

1104
01:06:43,780 --> 01:06:45,780
Like this we turn once

1105
01:06:44,300 --> 01:06:45,580
Kimchi pot lid

1106
01:06:46,950 --> 01:06:48,530
Twice

1107
01:06:49,010 --> 01:06:51,530
It's 3 times for a tea ceremony right?

1108
01:06:52,400 --> 01:06:56,180
He hasn't realized the goal has been reached, and enjoys some tea.

1109
01:06:58,860 --> 01:07:00,980
Wonderful Tea etiquette

1110
01:07:01,220 --> 01:07:02,610
Then

1111
01:07:03,300 --> 01:07:04,500
Let's do it!

1112
01:07:04,930 --> 01:07:08,240
After seeing Nasubi's determination, the staff thought that...

1113
01:07:08,760 --> 01:07:12,250
After trying so hard, business class is just not good enough.

1114
01:07:12,850 --> 01:07:14,040
So...

1115
01:07:14,860 --> 01:07:17,530
Rank up to First class!

1116
01:07:17,660 --> 01:07:18,960
So that means!

1117
01:07:19,640 --> 01:07:22,360
We also rank up the goal price! (81,600円)

1118
01:07:22,480 --> 01:07:23,840
And that means...!

1119
01:07:23,930 --> 01:07:26,240
To reach the 81,600 Yen goal he needs...

1120
01:07:26,520 --> 01:07:28,800
Another 19,800円

1121
01:07:29,450 --> 01:07:31,480
Good luck Nasubi !!

1122
01:07:31,930 --> 01:07:33,810
Pork rib seasoning

1123
01:07:32,600 --> 01:07:36,160
As expected, Nasubi gives it his best

1124
01:07:33,810 --> 01:07:34,810
Bamboo Sword

1125
01:07:35,060 --> 01:07:36,720
Picture frame

1126
01:07:37,010 --> 01:07:38,650
Live Octopus

1127
01:07:38,860 --> 01:07:40,720
Fox scarf

1128
01:07:41,000 --> 01:07:42,700
Hey you're pretty cool right?

1129
01:07:42,700 --> 01:07:45,640
I wanted a companion for a while now!

1130
01:07:45,780 --> 01:07:48,080
Speaking of Korea...

1131
01:07:48,370 --> 01:07:51,050
Nasubi is struggling to name his partner

1132
01:07:51,540 --> 01:07:54,170
Just then one word comes to mind...

1133
01:07:55,000 --> 01:07:56,200
How about Kalubi?

1134
01:07:56,460 --> 01:07:59,550
So... What will the name be for his Korean partner?

1135
01:08:00,120 --> 01:08:02,800
Bi-kalu is a name with a good feeling!

1136
01:08:03,200 --> 01:08:09,490
A new friendship is born with partner Bi-kalu
and Nasubi thinks he will bring good luck!

1137
01:08:10,480 --> 01:08:12,240
Total prize money so far is...

1138
01:08:12,340 --> 01:08:14,640
73,590 Yen

1139
01:08:15,060 --> 01:08:19,780
To reach the 81,600 Yen goal, he needed another 8,010円

1140
01:08:20,290 --> 01:08:24,220
And the prize this time is a Fox scarf worth 12,000 Yen

1141
01:08:24,220 --> 01:08:25,560
So that means!

1142
01:08:25,800 --> 01:08:29,090
The total prize winning value is 85,590円

1143
01:08:29,260 --> 01:08:30,410
So that means!!

1144
01:08:30,730 --> 01:08:35,800
The 81,600 Yen goal has been reached!
Prize life contest in Korea is compete!

1145
01:08:37,260 --> 01:08:45,290
This was his first time in the country and also experiencing the language.
But regardless, he climbed that wall with great courage.

1146
01:08:45,330 --> 01:08:51,180
And for the second time, he conquered the Prize life contest in a foreign country

1147
01:08:51,610 --> 01:08:55,560
The victory took 91 days to reach the goal (Total prize value 85,590 Yen)

1148
01:08:55,940 --> 01:08:56,800
But !!

1149
01:08:57,760 --> 01:09:00,300
With Bi-kalu watching, he starts writing postcards!

1150
01:09:00,410 --> 01:09:02,440
Nasubi hasn't realised he reached the goal!

1151
01:09:02,440 --> 01:09:04,220
We need to tell him quickly!!

1152
01:09:04,490 --> 01:09:06,100
However...

1153
01:09:06,240 --> 01:09:09,650
Bi-kalu, I'm gonna do my best to write post cards ok!

1154
01:09:10,740 --> 01:09:14,540
After seeing Nasubi's determination, the staff thought that...

1155
01:09:14,920 --> 01:09:20,020
The goal was 81,600 Yen from Seoul to Tokyo by First class

1156
01:09:20,410 --> 01:09:24,680
After trying so hard, it's just not good enough to go straight from Seoul to Tokyo.

1157
01:09:25,210 --> 01:09:26,520
So...

1158
01:09:26,940 --> 01:09:30,340
Trip to Paris inclusion scale up!

1159
01:09:30,540 --> 01:09:31,850
So that means!

1160
01:09:32,260 --> 01:09:34,720
The goal has also...

1161
01:09:34,840 --> 01:09:36,330
However!

1162
01:09:36,490 --> 01:09:39,440
Surely I've reached the goal by now...

1163
01:09:39,440 --> 01:09:41,440
Crap! He realised!!

1164
01:09:41,840 --> 01:09:43,440
So...

1165
01:09:45,280 --> 01:09:47,260
Night time

1166
01:09:49,000 --> 01:09:51,020
The producer appears

1167
01:09:51,930 --> 01:09:55,720
Holding the light, the producer searches for Nasubi.

1168
01:09:58,170 --> 01:10:00,220
Nasubi sighted!

1169
01:10:01,250 --> 01:10:04,700
But here an accident happens to Nasubi..

1170
01:10:07,100 --> 01:10:07,960
Ah! I'm sorry!

1171
01:10:08,260 --> 01:10:11,250
The torch slipped and hit Nasubi right in the crotch!

1172
01:10:11,650 --> 01:10:13,220
As a result...

1173
01:10:14,520 --> 01:10:16,020
Nasubi has awoken ♥

1174
01:10:19,120 --> 01:10:20,140
Huh?

1175
01:10:26,200 --> 01:10:27,300
Shall we go?

1176
01:10:31,660 --> 01:10:32,490
Huh?

1177
01:10:33,700 --> 01:10:36,480
Not knowing the goal situation, he is taken out the room

1178
01:10:37,280 --> 01:10:38,330
Where we going?

1179
01:10:38,490 --> 01:10:40,570
Nasubi is being taken to...

1180
01:10:41,290 --> 01:10:44,400
Denpa Shounen Naked festival! March 28th Broadcast

1181
01:10:42,810 --> 01:10:44,410
The goal arena in Japan

1182
01:10:44,980 --> 01:10:49,980
There, Matsumoto and Chuyan along with 1000 audience members waited for Nasubi's return

1183
01:10:50,760 --> 01:10:53,700
This is Nasubi's... Waiting room?

1184
01:10:53,880 --> 01:10:56,200
Firstly, please watch this...

1185
01:10:57,980 --> 01:11:04,420
As usual Nasubi will be wearing headphones and an eye mask, accompanied by the producer

1186
01:11:04,480 --> 01:11:08,440
And will be brought here and put in the waiting room.

1187
01:11:08,580 --> 01:11:15,140
Then, Nasubi will take off the headphones and eye mask...

1188
01:11:15,780 --> 01:11:19,330
And the countdown will begin!

1189
01:11:20,450 --> 01:11:25,770
As he doesn't know about us or anything here please be quiet

1190
01:11:25,840 --> 01:11:31,200
The countdown will commence 3,2,1 and when zero is reached...

1191
01:11:31,280 --> 01:11:37,560
This... Box will fall away!

1192
01:11:39,710 --> 01:11:41,710
He's here, Nasubi is here!

1193
01:11:49,050 --> 01:11:52,490
Nasubi appears with the producer on stage

1194
01:11:53,280 --> 01:11:58,420
Of course as he is wearing headphones and an eye mask he knows nothing about the situation.

1195
01:12:00,650 --> 01:12:04,320
With 1000 people watching the waiting room
Nasubi takes off the eye mask

1196
01:12:04,330 --> 01:12:06,720
And does something that surprises everyone!

1197
01:12:07,780 --> 01:12:09,770
He starts to get undressed!

1198
01:12:10,080 --> 01:12:11,680
What should I do about my pants?

1199
01:12:11,760 --> 01:12:13,690
Should be ok to take them off

1200
01:12:14,860 --> 01:12:16,290
Naked ♥

1201
01:12:17,740 --> 01:12:22,410

Can I come in? Is it okay to come in? Please excuse us!

1210
01:14:32,550 --> 01:14:34,550
Ah! Sorry, please excuse us!

1211
01:14:37,890 --> 01:14:39,860
Hello Nasubi...

1212
01:14:40,060 --> 01:14:42,490
The, the house collapsed...

1213
01:14:49,010 --> 01:14:52,260
Your house, here, Nasubi's room collapsed...

1214
01:14:52,260 --> 01:14:54,450
Then all these people...

1215
01:14:56,040 --> 01:14:57,890
Why they are laughing?

1216
01:15:00,970 --> 01:15:04,730
Do you know where this is right now?

1217
01:15:08,490 --> 01:15:10,930
Do you... Know where... This is... Right now?

1218
01:15:11,020 --> 01:15:11,780
Huh?

1219
01:15:16,760 --> 01:15:18,840
Anyway, what is this?

1220
01:15:19,810 --> 01:15:24,540
Nasubi, you have finally reached the prize life goal!
Congratulations!

1221
01:15:26,600 --> 01:15:28,600
Well done! Congratulations!

1222
01:15:33,010 --> 01:15:37,580
All these guests have come to this arena to see Nasubi reach the goal

1223
01:15:37,660 --> 01:15:41,810
That's the reason they're all here, as guests!

1224
01:15:42,610 --> 01:15:44,300
Is that so... HUH?!

1225
01:15:46,130 --> 01:15:48,450
So that's why we're all here?

1226
01:15:48,520 --> 01:15:50,890
Nasubi you reached the goal !

1227
01:15:51,050 --> 01:15:52,500
Oh? Is that true?

01:15:52,610 --> 01:15:54,170
It's over! Congratulations!

1229
01:15:54,220 --> 01:15:55,940
Ah! Thank you very much!

With a thousand people in the arena the goal has been reached!!

1231
01:16:01,330 --> 01:16:05,280
So Nasubi, it's been 1 year and 3 months you've been in the prize life contest...

1232
01:16:05,370 --> 01:16:07,690
During that time there has been global trouble !!

1233
01:16:07,740 --> 01:16:09,060
Global??

1234
01:16:09,130 --> 01:16:11,340
Please watch this !

1235
01:16:11,810 --> 01:16:14,700
January 15th 1998

1236
01:16:15,450 --> 01:16:18,860
In Tokyo there was record heavy snow on that day.

1237
01:16:19,370 --> 01:16:20,650
I won!

1238
01:16:21,780 --> 01:16:24,660
This unknown mans challenge had begun...

1239
01:16:25,300 --> 01:16:28,080
With pure determination to send postcard entries

1240
01:16:28,660 --> 01:16:31,650
Prizes brought great emotional high's and low's

1241
01:16:32,460 --> 01:16:36,930
He garnered attention of everyone throughout Japan!

1242
01:16:37,620 --> 01:16:43,170
Then he moved to Korea and even more people noticed him!

1243
01:16:43,930 --> 01:16:49,380
For that period of 1 year and 3 months Japan had a record breaking Nasubi fever that swept the nation!

1244
01:16:50,370 --> 01:16:53,560
He began gaining stardom when first noticed by the media!

1245
01:16:53,780 --> 01:16:57,780
Many magazines and newspaper featured articles on him!

1246
01:16:59,740 --> 01:17:03,090
One even featured his face on the front cover!

1247
01:17:03,440 --> 01:17:07,100
But the Nasubi fever doesn't stop here.

1248
01:17:07,900 --> 01:17:13,060
Nasubi's challenge was also featured on the English national TV station BBC and broadcast world wide!

1249
01:17:15,720 --> 01:17:18,640
And the diary he poured his hearts feelings into...

1250
01:17:19,140 --> 01:17:23,420
Titled 'Prize Diary' there was 4 books covering Japan and 1 that covered Korea.

1251
01:17:24,240 --> 01:17:28,700
Over 800,000 copies where sold and it became a best seller!

1252
01:17:29,160 --> 01:17:37,440
During this period book 2 was so popular it ranked first with the most sales and also book 1 in fourth place simultaneously!

1253
01:17:37,660 --> 01:17:44,520
And also! Nasubi's prize life contest part 1 video already sold over 100,000 copies! How wonderful to watch!

1254
01:17:45,020 --> 01:17:49,120
Nasubi never knew about it but also...

1255
01:17:50,000 --> 01:17:53,570
It all began on the day he won the dryer...

1256
01:17:54,500 --> 01:17:59,060
Nasubi's room 24 hour live stream broadcast!

1257
01:17:59,360 --> 01:18:02,780
With over 1.6 million views total...

1258
01:18:03,060 --> 01:18:07,050
This set a record in Japanese internet history for the most web hits!
(as a paid service)

1259
01:18:07,600 --> 01:18:12,050
When he hit the 1 Million Yen goal, he ate ramen for the first time in 11 months

1260
01:18:12,760 --> 01:18:17,040
To be honest, this clip is very serious...

1261
01:18:17,480 --> 01:18:18,860
That's because...

1262
01:18:19,290 --> 01:18:22,160
It's a ramen commercial!

1263
01:18:23,680 --> 01:18:27,850
Enjoying ramen simply like this is being used for national broadcast!

1264
01:18:28,370 --> 01:18:29,320
It's great

1265
01:18:29,330 --> 01:18:30,900
It's not great.

1266
01:18:30,930 --> 01:18:31,790
It's fate!

1267
01:18:31,830 --> 01:18:34,420
That 'fate' pork ramen brand is... 'House'

1268
01:18:39,760 --> 01:18:42,290
Amazing! Congratulations!

1269
01:18:44,760 --> 01:18:48,430
Then appearing before Nasubi's eyes,
his first meal on returning to Japan.

1270
01:18:50,600 --> 01:18:51,790
Let's eat!

1271
01:18:55,800 --> 01:18:58,060
It's a Natto festival!

1272
01:18:59,860 --> 01:19:01,760
This is Japan!

1273
01:19:03,730 --> 01:19:06,970
Then he has a press conference with the media and finally...

1274
01:19:07,720 --> 01:19:11,990
Denpa Shonen naked festival has come to a close.

1275
01:19:12,550 --> 01:19:16,870
Now please enjoy this post goal personal footage.

1276
01:19:27,100 --> 01:19:30,240
What was the first thing he said off stage?

1277
01:19:30,780 --> 01:19:33,420
They got me pretty good.

1278
01:19:33,920 --> 01:19:38,200
After leaving the event arena they travel to a hotel.

1279
01:19:38,930 --> 01:19:39,970
(Deep breath)

1280
01:19:40,210 --> 01:19:45,980
It's been 1 year and 3 months, but the prize life contest...

1281
01:19:46,320 --> 01:19:48,650
Is really finished this time.

1282
01:19:49,010 --> 01:19:52,800
From here Nasubi begins to digest the reality of reaching the goal.

1283
01:19:53,480 --> 01:19:56,320
But then that man appears!

1284
01:19:58,030 --> 01:20:00,620
Chuyan ♥

1285
01:19:58,030 --> 01:20:03,370
(Chuyan appeared in Denpa Shounen hitchhike Europe to Africa)

1286
01:20:00,940 --> 01:20:03,360
Do you. Know where. You are. Right now?

1287
01:20:03,440 --> 01:20:04,520
Huh?

1288
01:20:04,910 --> 01:20:07,950
Chuyan and Nasubi met for the first time today

1289
01:20:08,440 --> 01:20:12,320
He wanted to congratulate Nasubi once more, so he came to the hotel.

1290
01:20:12,800 --> 01:20:14,390
Well done for reaching the goal

1291
01:20:14,490 --> 01:20:16,080
Thank you

1292
01:20:16,240 --> 01:20:17,830
Please sit down

1293
01:20:18,730 --> 01:20:19,980
Good job

1294
01:20:20,030 --> 01:20:21,490
Thank you very much

1295
01:20:21,580 --> 01:20:22,620
Are you pleased?

1296
01:20:22,840 --> 01:20:24,790
I was pleased but...

1297
01:20:25,230 --> 01:20:26,660
I didn't understand it at all.

1298
01:20:26,660 --> 01:20:28,020
Yeah, I thought that...

1299
01:20:28,250 --> 01:20:30,730
Then Chuyan notices something

1300
01:20:31,420 --> 01:20:33,180
It's Nasubi's handwritten diary!

1301
01:20:33,740 --> 01:20:36,450
Your diary... good

1302
01:20:33,740 --> 01:20:38,150
(Chuyan is from China using Japanese he learnt from Takashii Ito during their hitchhike)

1303
01:20:36,550 --> 01:20:38,160
Super intresting

1304
01:20:39,630 --> 01:20:40,960
You've taken time to read it?

1305
01:20:40,980 --> 01:20:42,300
What?

1306
01:20:43,560 --> 01:20:46,610
Can you... Speak Korean?

1307
01:20:46,710 --> 01:20:47,990
안녕하세요 (Hello)

1308
01:20:48,790 --> 01:20:50,390
How do you say 'Thank you'?

1309
01:20:50,510 --> 01:20:51,690
고맙습니다 (Thank you)

1310
01:20:51,890 --> 01:20:54,570
Ehhhhhh! It difficult...

1311
01:21:02,180 --> 01:21:03,360
It difficult...

1312
01:21:03,380 --> 01:21:05,360
Hello is 'annyeonghaseyo'

1313
01:21:08,170 --> 01:21:12,690
You are super tough! If I was alone then I probably die.

1314
01:21:13,590 --> 01:21:17,350
You must been very alone, are your feeling ok?

1315
01:21:18,140 --> 01:21:20,050
Are you a pervert?

1316
01:21:21,100 --> 01:21:22,170
Soon...

1317
01:21:22,300 --> 01:21:23,940
Do your best!

1318
01:21:24,390 --> 01:21:25,870
Three days later...

1319
01:21:26,570 --> 01:21:29,140
Today, 'Naked festival' will be broadcast.

1320
01:21:29,520 --> 01:21:32,630
This is where Nasubi learns about everything that happened

1321
01:21:33,540 --> 01:21:35,920
The programme has started! (9PM)

1322
01:21:43,700 --> 01:21:45,140
It's me!

1323
01:21:46,580 --> 01:21:49,640
I'm really on TV!

1324
01:21:53,190 --> 01:21:57,840
Huh? R-mania? I definitely heard R-mania

1325
01:22:05,560 --> 01:22:07,990
Wow, it's really being broadcast.

1326
01:22:08,450 --> 01:22:10,540
'Naked festival...'

1327
01:22:16,630 --> 01:22:18,860
It's the studio set from then!

1328
01:22:20,580 --> 01:22:22,760
It's that arena!

1329
01:22:26,020 --> 01:22:29,900
I'm getting goosebumps, my back is tensing up!

1330
01:22:38,900 --> 01:22:40,900
What do they mean 'secret story'?

1331
01:22:41,340 --> 01:22:43,260
Hahaha it's me

1332
01:22:44,400 --> 01:22:46,840
What an idiot! How embarrassing

1333
01:22:48,470 --> 01:22:50,630
Woah they're really showing it all!

1334
01:22:51,020 --> 01:22:52,910
He's naked!

1335
01:22:55,350 --> 01:22:58,580
What? 81,000 Yen? Only that much?

1336
01:23:02,920 --> 01:23:04,340
Well done, Well done

1337
01:23:14,570 --> 01:23:16,760
Of course I wouldn't notice that!

1338
01:23:23,640 --> 01:23:25,710
First class?

1339
01:23:32,100 --> 01:23:37,390
What? What the heck are you talking about you fuck!

1340
01:23:37,470 --> 01:23:39,620
Hey wait!

1341
01:23:39,620 --> 01:23:41,620
It's not 1 Million again!!

1342
01:23:44,940 --> 01:23:47,620
Damn right I noticed! That was close!

1343
01:23:49,910 --> 01:23:54,660
Steadily entering the arena through a sea of cloud is Nasubi's waiting room

1344
01:23:56,860 --> 01:23:57,820
That's...

1345
01:23:58,650 --> 01:24:00,960
The house that fell down?

1346
01:24:00,980 --> 01:24:03,050
You bastards!

1347
01:24:04,280 --> 01:24:06,620
Coming out being lead by the hand

1348
01:24:08,140 --> 01:24:12,970
In front of all those people, I didn't know anything, just walking...

1349
01:24:13,120 --> 01:24:15,270
Here it is

1350
01:24:34,780 --> 01:24:37,580
How many times...

1351
01:24:51,950 --> 01:24:53,350
Amazing!

1352
01:25:14,520 --> 01:25:19,350
Nasubi... The end!

1353
01:25:19,930 --> 01:25:44,610
