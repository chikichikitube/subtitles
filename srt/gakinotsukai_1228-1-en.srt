1
00:00:00,480 --> 00:00:05,420
1st Time on Gaki no Tsukai ya Arrahende
"I'm the One Who Understands you Best!"

2
00:00:05,820 --> 00:00:10,920
"Anyways, I Think You'll Like this Item!" Azuma Mikihisa Edition!!

3
00:00:13,090 --> 00:00:17,930
I really hate this title.

4
00:00:17,930 --> 00:00:20,530
Nobody talks like that.

5
00:00:21,470 --> 00:00:30,680
A special series on Gaki, where the members buy gifts for guests based on their interests!!

6
00:00:31,410 --> 00:00:35,080
Today's guest is actor Azuma Mikihisa.

7
00:00:31,840 --> 00:00:35,080
45 Years Old

8
00:00:31,840 --> 00:00:35,080
Actor

9
00:00:31,840 --> 00:00:35,080
Single

10
00:00:36,010 --> 00:00:42,090
The five member's will present a top, hat and an accessory which they think will suit our guest.

11
00:00:42,750 --> 00:00:50,030
Can they find something to suit the currently single, 45 year old Azuma Mikihisa?

12
00:00:50,060 --> 00:00:50,930
Today, I'm going full attack.

13
00:00:50,930 --> 00:00:53,870
Today, I'm going full attack.

14
00:00:53,870 --> 00:00:56,770
And...?

15
00:00:56,770 --> 00:00:58,770
I'm taking this chance.

16
00:00:58,770 --> 00:01:03,910
Up until now the guests have been hard for me to pick for.

17
00:01:03,910 --> 00:01:07,050
I'm also pretty confident this time.

18
00:01:05,310 --> 00:01:07,610
Why is everyone so confident this time?

19
00:01:07,780 --> 00:01:08,710
We know him quite well from Downtown DX.

20
00:01:08,710 --> 00:01:10,820
We know him quite well from Downtown DX.

21
00:01:10,820 --> 00:01:15,450
On there we have a corner about casual clothes.

22
00:01:15,450 --> 00:01:17,290
So we should have a general idea.

23
00:01:16,560 --> 00:01:17,660
I see.

24
00:01:17,490 --> 00:01:18,460
What about you two?

25
00:01:18,460 --> 00:01:19,090
We've also watched Downtown DX before.

26
00:01:19,090 --> 00:01:21,690
We've also watched Downtown DX before.

27
00:01:21,690 --> 00:01:26,260
So, without further ado, let's bring out today's guest, Azuma Mikihisa.

28
00:01:31,640 --> 00:01:36,070
Azuma Mikihisa

29
00:01:36,270 --> 00:01:38,080
So it's this kind of thing.

30
00:01:38,080 --> 00:01:38,980
You're quite...

31
00:01:38,980 --> 00:01:40,380
Is this how you usually dress?

32
00:01:40,380 --> 00:01:42,480
I like to dress quite simply.

33
00:01:42,480 --> 00:01:44,320
Not always like this.

34
00:01:44,320 --> 00:01:46,220
So casually...

35
00:01:46,220 --> 00:01:49,350
So your casual clothes are more simple?

36
00:01:49,350 --> 00:01:51,560
Yes, I don't wear suits all that often.

37
00:01:52,890 --> 00:01:57,000
Before the show started, the Gaki members went shopping.

38
00:01:57,330 --> 00:02:04,170
Yūrakuchō

39
00:01:58,060 --> 00:02:04,170
Hoping to find a top to suit Mikihisa, Hamada heads to Yūrakuchō.

40
00:02:04,170 --> 00:02:10,910
Why do I have to worry about what Mikihisa would like?

41
00:02:11,240 --> 00:02:12,280
This looks pretty good, I wonder what it feels like to wear.

42
00:02:12,280 --> 00:02:15,410
This looks pretty good, I wonder what it feels like to wear.

43
00:02:15,410 --> 00:02:16,520
This'll suit you.

44
00:02:16,520 --> 00:02:19,550
You could see Azuma Mikihisa wearing this, right?

45
00:02:19,550 --> 00:02:23,090
He's probably already bought this.

46
00:02:23,460 --> 00:02:26,060
Shibuya

47
00:02:23,960 --> 00:02:26,060
Across town, Hōsei is...

48
00:02:26,060 --> 00:02:28,890
Today it's gotta be... a jacket, right?

49
00:02:28,890 --> 00:02:32,430
Today it's gotta be... a jacket, right?

50
00:02:32,430 --> 00:02:34,370
This is...

51
00:02:34,370 --> 00:02:37,070
...who do you think this is?

52
00:02:35,790 --> 00:02:37,070
Who?

53
00:02:37,070 --> 00:02:40,610
Like, who among the Gaki members?

54
00:02:42,510 --> 00:02:44,410
Endō-san.

55
00:02:42,510 --> 00:02:44,410
Staff

56
00:02:44,410 --> 00:02:46,480
Yes, this is so Endō.

57
00:02:48,410 --> 00:02:50,980
This would be perfect for Endō.

58
00:02:50,980 --> 00:02:52,880
This would be perfect for Endō.

59
00:02:52,880 --> 00:02:54,650
Erm, but we're looking for Azuma-san.

60
00:02:52,880 --> 00:02:54,650
Staff

61
00:02:54,650 --> 00:02:54,890
Ah Azuma-san.

62
00:02:54,890 --> 00:02:55,690
Ah Azuma-san.

63
00:02:56,050 --> 00:03:01,360
Omotesandō

64
00:02:56,620 --> 00:03:01,360
Endō has come to Omotesandō in search of a hat for Mikihisa.

65
00:03:01,360 --> 00:03:03,760
The image I have of Mikihisa is...

66
00:03:03,760 --> 00:03:09,400
...dark skin, white teeth and a former Teamer.

67
00:03:03,760 --> 00:03:14,810
Teamer = Gangs of youth often wearing American casual clothes.

68
00:03:09,400 --> 00:03:13,000
I think most former Teamers

69
00:03:13,000 --> 00:03:14,810
would like stuff with skulls on.

70
00:03:14,810 --> 00:03:17,210
Do you have anything with a skull on top?

71
00:03:17,210 --> 00:03:18,510
Do you have anything with a skull on top?

72
00:03:18,510 --> 00:03:20,850
A skull is maybe a bit much.

73
00:03:20,850 --> 00:03:22,850
This is the most similar we have...

74
00:03:25,250 --> 00:03:26,350
If you did this with a skull print, it'd be perfect.

75
00:03:26,350 --> 00:03:28,950
If you did this with a skull print, it'd be perfect.

76
00:03:29,320 --> 00:03:33,430
Ueno

77
00:03:29,920 --> 00:03:33,430
Searching for an accessory, Matsumoto has come to Ueno.

78
00:03:33,960 --> 00:03:35,360
I think...

79
00:03:35,360 --> 00:03:36,390
...I'd rather buy something for myself, it's cold out here.

80
00:03:36,390 --> 00:03:39,530
...I'd rather buy something for myself, it's cold out here.

81
00:03:40,700 --> 00:03:42,370
Let's have a look in here.

82
00:03:42,870 --> 00:03:45,800
Thinking about it...

83
00:03:45,800 --> 00:03:48,070
...maybe something like this.

84
00:03:48,170 --> 00:03:49,770
Maybe this'd be good.

85
00:03:49,770 --> 00:03:50,680
What sort of situation would you use this in?

86
00:03:50,680 --> 00:03:54,810
What sort of situation would you use this in?

87
00:03:54,810 --> 00:03:56,180
I can't think of a time when I'd need something like this, can you?

88
00:03:56,180 --> 00:03:59,280
I can't think of a time when I'd need something like this, can you?

89
00:03:59,850 --> 00:04:03,920
Tanaka has come to a western shop in Ueno in search of a top.

90
00:04:06,690 --> 00:04:08,960
Ah this is cool.

91
00:04:09,830 --> 00:04:11,160
Thank you.

92
00:04:11,700 --> 00:04:14,700
Would you mind putting this on?

93
00:04:18,270 --> 00:04:20,770
Ah that looks great.

94
00:04:20,770 --> 00:04:23,380
It looks even cooler when you see it on someone.

95
00:04:23,380 --> 00:04:25,110
It looks even cooler when you see it on someone.

96
00:04:25,410 --> 00:04:27,610
As I thought, this is good.

97
00:04:29,750 --> 00:04:31,380
I think he's going to love this.

98
00:04:32,080 --> 00:04:41,160
As always, the guest will take home their favourite items. The worst will have to pay out of their own pocket.

99
00:04:41,690 --> 00:04:46,100
To start off, Tanaka will present his top to Mikihisa.

100
00:04:46,160 --> 00:04:48,100
Shall we get going?

101
00:04:46,770 --> 00:04:48,100
Let's do it.

102
00:04:49,170 --> 00:04:50,940
Let's see your attack Tanaka.

103
00:04:50,940 --> 00:04:55,670
If you don't attack, you're not gonna win.
It's alright as long as you don't embarrass yourself.

104
00:04:55,670 --> 00:04:57,910
Since I'm first, that won't happen.

105
00:05:00,410 --> 00:05:01,750
Please.

106
00:05:03,050 --> 00:05:04,220
What is this?

107
00:05:04,950 --> 00:05:06,180
This is truly special.

108
00:05:05,250 --> 00:05:11,160
8,800 Yen (£51/$81)

109
00:05:05,250 --> 00:05:11,160
Price conversions are approximate for time of airing.

110
00:05:06,850 --> 00:05:09,190
I've got a bad feeling about this.

111
00:05:09,190 --> 00:05:11,160
You're just messing around.

112
00:05:11,160 --> 00:05:12,260
A waistcoat!?
Wait.. not a waistcoat, a vest.

113
00:05:12,260 --> 00:05:14,830
A waistcoat!?
Wait.. not a waistcoat, a vest.

114
00:05:14,830 --> 00:05:16,030
Mikihisa-san

115
00:05:16,030 --> 00:05:19,830
definitely has this image of wearing a vest, don't you think?

116
00:05:18,300 --> 00:05:19,830
Does he?

117
00:05:19,830 --> 00:05:21,900
An image of a vest and shirt.

118
00:05:21,900 --> 00:05:23,600
He definitely does.

119
00:05:22,930 --> 00:05:24,540
When have you seen that?

120
00:05:24,100 --> 00:05:25,470
I've seen it plenty...

121
00:05:26,140 --> 00:05:28,440
This is truly awful Tanaka.

122
00:05:28,440 --> 00:05:31,140
This isn't even something to laugh at.

123
00:05:31,680 --> 00:05:36,050
Is he Shishido Joe?

124
00:05:31,680 --> 00:05:36,050
Shishido Joe is an old Japanese actor known for his role in the Western: Quick Draw Joe (1961).

125
00:05:36,050 --> 00:05:41,750
No! I have this great image of him wearing this vest along with an open shirt...

126
00:05:41,750 --> 00:05:43,460
That's true, maybe...

127
00:05:42,390 --> 00:05:44,090
The vest with an open shirt, right?

128
00:05:43,490 --> 00:05:46,930
Mikihisa, do you think you could try it on for us?

129
00:05:47,930 --> 00:05:49,490
This'll look great.

130
00:05:48,690 --> 00:05:51,960
Even if the shirt is a little smart...

131
00:05:52,660 --> 00:05:53,960
This is...

132
00:05:53,430 --> 00:05:55,960
See!

133
00:05:59,000 --> 00:06:00,570
It looks terrible.

134
00:06:00,570 --> 00:06:02,270
He looks like a comedian.

135
00:06:02,270 --> 00:06:04,910
He looks like the manager at a steakhouse.

136
00:06:10,920 --> 00:06:16,890
Timed, Typeset & Translated by Inepped

137
00:06:17,820 --> 00:06:24,760
"I think you'll like this item"
Endō is the next to present his top.

138
00:06:28,600 --> 00:06:33,040
It's black but...

139
00:06:33,710 --> 00:06:36,540
...I think a long t-shirt will really suit Mikihisa-san.

140
00:06:34,740 --> 00:06:40,780
3,456 Yen (£21/$24)

141
00:06:35,270 --> 00:06:36,540
A long t-shirt?

142
00:06:36,540 --> 00:06:38,640
It's a long t-shirt but...

143
00:06:38,640 --> 00:06:40,640
...if I'm right...

144
00:06:40,640 --> 00:06:42,410
...Azuma Mikihisa-san...

145
00:06:42,410 --> 00:06:43,620
...was a Shibuya Teamer.

146
00:06:43,620 --> 00:06:47,050
...was a Shibuya Teamer.

147
00:06:44,620 --> 00:06:47,050
Yes I was.

148
00:06:47,050 --> 00:06:48,750
This is for Azuma Mikihisa?

149
00:06:48,750 --> 00:06:50,320
It's a skull of roses.

150
00:06:50,320 --> 00:06:52,990
It's a skull of roses.

151
00:06:52,780 --> 00:06:55,330
Ah, those are roses.

152
00:06:55,330 --> 00:06:57,330
White roses, red roses...

153
00:06:56,290 --> 00:07:00,470
Right right, it's nostalgic right?

154
00:07:00,470 --> 00:07:03,100
I don't remember this.

155
00:07:01,530 --> 00:07:03,100
That sort of

156
00:07:03,100 --> 00:07:04,770
rebellious feel.

157
00:07:04,770 --> 00:07:06,040
Teamers were over 25 years ago.

158
00:07:06,040 --> 00:07:08,570
Teamers were over 25 years ago.

159
00:07:09,310 --> 00:07:13,580
Next up is Hamada, what sort of image of Mikihisa does he have?

160
00:07:13,580 --> 00:07:16,180
When you think of Azuma Mikihisa...

161
00:07:16,180 --> 00:07:19,480
...you picture him wearing a jacket.

162
00:07:19,480 --> 00:07:22,650
Rather than just a regular jacket

163
00:07:22,650 --> 00:07:29,490
I thought something like this would be good from time to time.

164
00:07:27,290 --> 00:07:29,490
I think that's from Omotesandō.

165
00:07:30,260 --> 00:07:32,000
I picture him wearing one with buttons rather than a zip.

166
00:07:32,000 --> 00:07:36,000
I picture him wearing one with buttons rather than a zip.

167
00:07:33,030 --> 00:07:36,000
Ah, that's probably true.

168
00:07:36,460 --> 00:07:38,840
It's a pain if there's loads of 'em though.

169
00:07:40,360 --> 00:07:43,370
You're just buying for yourself.

170
00:07:41,410 --> 00:07:47,880
14,580 Yen (£90/$100)

171
00:07:43,370 --> 00:07:47,550
That's just for Hamada-san!

172
00:07:47,880 --> 00:07:50,750
That's definitely a Hamada-san jacket.

173
00:07:50,750 --> 00:07:52,980
This'd probably suit you more.

174
00:07:55,920 --> 00:07:59,190
The material is so soft and fluffy!

175
00:07:59,420 --> 00:08:00,120
Put it on properly!!

176
00:08:00,120 --> 00:08:02,760
Put it on properly!!

177
00:08:02,760 --> 00:08:05,600
The button's stuck.

178
00:08:05,130 --> 00:08:07,600
Do it right man.

179
00:08:07,600 --> 00:08:09,600
But, you know...

180
00:08:09,030 --> 00:08:10,500
But...

181
00:08:10,500 --> 00:08:11,400
How is it?

182
00:08:11,400 --> 00:08:15,570
You can also pop the collar, which I like.

183
00:08:13,550 --> 00:08:15,570
This is good!

184
00:08:15,570 --> 00:08:17,440
It is right?

185
00:08:17,440 --> 00:08:21,580
You've even buttoned it up wrong!!

186
00:08:19,080 --> 00:08:21,580
Get it right already!!

187
00:08:24,120 --> 00:08:28,350
Next up is Hōsei, what sort of top has he found?

188
00:08:28,350 --> 00:08:30,660
Mikihisa-san

189
00:08:30,660 --> 00:08:32,060
I think this'll get you excited.

190
00:08:32,060 --> 00:08:34,490
I don't think the others were particularly exciting.

191
00:08:39,260 --> 00:08:40,830
I see what you mean.

192
00:08:42,570 --> 00:08:43,740
Camouflage?

193
00:08:44,000 --> 00:08:48,540
15,984 Yen (£92/$48)

194
00:08:44,640 --> 00:08:46,740
This isn't it.

195
00:08:48,540 --> 00:08:50,510
Cut it out with the camouflage.

196
00:08:50,510 --> 00:08:54,110
I guess camouflage comes in various colours.

197
00:08:54,110 --> 00:08:59,650
Yeah, normally you see the green camouflage.

198
00:09:00,550 --> 00:09:02,290
It's tiny!

199
00:09:01,420 --> 00:09:02,820
It's a little small.

200
00:09:03,920 --> 00:09:06,420
The size is totally wrong!

201
00:09:05,120 --> 00:09:07,960
This looks great!

202
00:09:08,090 --> 00:09:10,630
Look Mikihisa-san is laughing.

203
00:09:08,890 --> 00:09:10,630
This is just awful.

204
00:09:12,060 --> 00:09:14,100
The size is...

205
00:09:14,530 --> 00:09:17,670
He's turned into a scientist!

206
00:09:17,670 --> 00:09:20,470
The sleeves are like a lab coat's.

207
00:09:23,310 --> 00:09:27,450
Last to present is Matsumoto. How will it go?

208
00:09:27,510 --> 00:09:28,980
Well you're up Matsumoto-san.

209
00:09:28,980 --> 00:09:30,880
Matsumoto-san was quite confident...

210
00:09:29,850 --> 00:09:31,950
When I was walking around...

211
00:09:31,950 --> 00:09:33,950
...I was thinking, 'What would he like?'

212
00:09:33,950 --> 00:09:36,290
I saw this and thought, 'Ah, this is it!'

213
00:09:36,290 --> 00:09:38,990
You guys weren't thinking enough about him.

214
00:09:38,990 --> 00:09:41,960
I feel so sorry for him!

215
00:09:41,960 --> 00:09:45,860
Please choose something more colourful next time.

216
00:09:49,330 --> 00:09:52,000
It's vivid.

217
00:09:50,840 --> 00:09:52,000
What's with that? Vivid?

218
00:09:52,000 --> 00:09:54,000
This is high quality.

219
00:09:53,300 --> 00:09:55,170
They make stuff in this colour?

220
00:09:54,340 --> 00:09:56,810
It looks great in this colour.

221
00:09:59,610 --> 00:10:04,920
30,240 Yen (£174/$280)

222
00:09:59,810 --> 00:10:00,650
A blue P-Coat.

223
00:10:00,650 --> 00:10:03,280
A P-Coat in a deep blue.

224
00:10:03,280 --> 00:10:05,120
This is a great choice right?

225
00:10:05,120 --> 00:10:06,120
I'm not so sure.

226
00:10:06,120 --> 00:10:08,190
This might not work for everyone...

227
00:10:08,190 --> 00:10:10,720
...you've gotta fit the style.

228
00:10:10,720 --> 00:10:11,990
This'll definitely work.

229
00:10:11,990 --> 00:10:15,630
Have a look at the monitor, it looks great on you.

230
00:10:16,230 --> 00:10:17,630
What do you think?

231
00:10:17,630 --> 00:10:22,070
It's not that it doesn't suit him, but casually...

232
00:10:22,070 --> 00:10:23,530
I see where you're coming from.

233
00:10:23,530 --> 00:10:25,530
I don't know if he'd wear it all the time...

234
00:10:27,370 --> 00:10:31,380
Maybe you can wear it when you're over 60.

235
00:10:31,380 --> 00:10:33,380
It'll be perfect for then.

236
00:10:36,180 --> 00:10:40,620
So, which top will Mikihisa choose as his favourite?

237
00:10:40,620 --> 00:10:46,320
Endō

238
00:10:40,620 --> 00:10:46,320
Hamada

239
00:10:40,620 --> 00:10:46,320
Hōsei

240
00:10:40,620 --> 00:10:46,320
Matsumoto

241
00:10:40,620 --> 00:10:46,320
Tanaka

242
00:10:40,690 --> 00:10:44,590
Tanaka is once again...

243
00:10:41,790 --> 00:10:44,590
It's definitely last.

244
00:10:44,590 --> 00:10:46,320
You think mine's last?

245
00:10:46,460 --> 00:10:48,790
I don't know. Are you sure?

246
00:10:48,790 --> 00:10:51,900
You're way behind the curve.

247
00:10:51,900 --> 00:10:53,830
It will definitely suit you Mikihisa-san. Truly.

248
00:10:53,830 --> 00:10:56,530
You'll have to be holding a stone hatchet wearing that.

249
00:10:56,700 --> 00:10:58,530
In first place is...?

250
00:10:59,370 --> 00:11:00,530
First is...

251
00:11:08,450 --> 00:11:12,080
The size and feel are excellent.

252
00:11:12,550 --> 00:11:16,090
When I was on the escalator, I saw it and knew it was the one!

253
00:11:17,360 --> 00:11:19,120
It couldn't be anything but this!

254
00:11:18,790 --> 00:11:20,090
So in second is?

255
00:11:21,790 --> 00:11:23,160
In second...

256
00:11:22,890 --> 00:11:24,720
Second is mine right?

257
00:11:24,720 --> 00:11:26,230
Thank you.

258
00:11:26,230 --> 00:11:28,130
Well, it's easy to wear.

259
00:11:28,600 --> 00:11:30,200
And in third is Endō's skull t-shirt.

260
00:11:30,200 --> 00:11:32,840
And in third is Endō's skull t-shirt.

261
00:11:34,240 --> 00:11:38,610
Which of these tops will come in last!?

262
00:11:38,710 --> 00:11:42,380
So we're down to the final two.

263
00:11:42,380 --> 00:11:43,880
Which will be the worst?

264
00:11:43,880 --> 00:11:45,880
Yeah, please be honest.

265
00:11:45,520 --> 00:11:47,750
In fourth place is...?

266
00:11:47,750 --> 00:11:49,750
It's this.

267
00:11:49,750 --> 00:11:52,820
Of course it is. I wasn't even worried.

268
00:11:53,460 --> 00:11:54,690
Seriously...

269
00:11:54,690 --> 00:11:57,230
Seriously Tanaka, look at it!

270
00:11:57,230 --> 00:11:58,960
It's weird.

271
00:11:59,600 --> 00:12:00,770
Really?

272
00:12:00,770 --> 00:12:01,830
This is just...

273
00:12:01,830 --> 00:12:04,240
...impossible.

274
00:12:03,240 --> 00:12:04,900
You were surprised right?

275
00:12:03,740 --> 00:12:04,900
Yeah.

276
00:12:04,900 --> 00:12:07,070
Even if I were naked, cold and dying, I wouldn't wear that.

277
00:12:07,070 --> 00:12:08,910
Even if I were naked, cold and dying, I wouldn't wear that.

278
00:12:09,710 --> 00:12:13,880
Tanaka has to pay out 8,800 Yen (£51/$81)!!

279
00:12:14,550 --> 00:12:18,820
Next, finding a hat to suit Mikihisa. First up is Endō.

280
00:12:18,850 --> 00:12:20,620
This colour?

281
00:12:19,610 --> 00:12:20,620
Yes.

282
00:12:20,620 --> 00:12:22,320
Please show it.

283
00:12:21,650 --> 00:12:24,960
12,960 Yen (£74/$120)

284
00:12:24,360 --> 00:12:27,160
He's trying his best.

285
00:12:24,960 --> 00:12:25,320
No, no, no.

286
00:12:25,320 --> 00:12:25,620
No, no, no.

287
00:12:25,620 --> 00:12:27,830
No, no, no.

288
00:12:27,830 --> 00:12:33,530
The feather gives it a slightly wilder feel.

289
00:12:35,170 --> 00:12:38,340
This is perfect for a former Teamer.

290
00:12:36,330 --> 00:12:38,340
Stop it with that.

291
00:12:38,340 --> 00:12:40,340
It was 25 years ago.

292
00:12:41,810 --> 00:12:42,510
See! It looks great!

293
00:12:42,510 --> 00:12:47,450
See! It looks great!

294
00:12:48,980 --> 00:12:51,850
The size is a little...

295
00:12:50,850 --> 00:12:53,480
The size is totally off.

296
00:12:53,680 --> 00:12:55,750
I look like I'm ready to fire the starting pistol.

297
00:12:55,750 --> 00:12:58,860
I look like I'm ready to fire the starting pistol.

298
00:13:00,140 --> 00:13:03,060
You could tell by his face that he'd never wear this.

299
00:13:03,830 --> 00:13:08,030
Next up to present his hat is Hamada.

300
00:13:08,030 --> 00:13:11,100
Shozo's and mine aren't too different.

301
00:13:11,470 --> 00:13:15,670
The style is pretty similar but a different colour.

302
00:13:16,670 --> 00:13:18,740
This feels like Mikihisa's style.

303
00:13:18,740 --> 00:13:21,280
Another completely different colour.

304
00:13:22,310 --> 00:13:29,590
20,520 Yen (£118/$190)

305
00:13:22,760 --> 00:13:24,780
This is kinda...

306
00:13:24,780 --> 00:13:29,590
It's Kaneko Nobuo.

307
00:13:24,780 --> 00:13:29,590
Kaneko Nobuo was a Japanese actor, often playing a hardened Yakuza.

308
00:13:28,090 --> 00:13:30,760
Why Kaneko Nobuo?

309
00:13:31,220 --> 00:13:33,890
I think this red colour will work well.

310
00:13:33,890 --> 00:13:35,890
Hmm, I guess so.

311
00:13:35,890 --> 00:13:37,430
Blue...

312
00:13:39,530 --> 00:13:42,230
I mean it's mostly that same hat just in a brownish colour.

313
00:13:42,230 --> 00:13:44,600
That's true, it's pretty similar.

314
00:13:44,600 --> 00:13:47,100
Well... maybe. But it looks better in red.

315
00:13:47,100 --> 00:13:47,410
Try it on already!!

316
00:13:47,410 --> 00:13:48,670
Try it on already!!

317
00:13:50,040 --> 00:13:51,540
Hurry up.

318
00:13:51,010 --> 00:13:52,980
He hit him earlier as well.

319
00:13:54,810 --> 00:13:56,380
Put on the hat.

320
00:13:56,380 --> 00:13:58,850
It'll look different compared to the white.

321
00:13:58,620 --> 00:14:00,720
The size looks the same.

322
00:13:59,580 --> 00:14:00,720
Just the same.

323
00:14:00,720 --> 00:14:02,720
It doesn't look as small.

324
00:14:04,760 --> 00:14:09,260
I had a feeling most of these would be similar.

325
00:14:10,030 --> 00:14:14,270
Third up is Matsumoto, what sort of image is he thinking of?

326
00:14:14,440 --> 00:14:18,400
You guys have played quite safe.

327
00:14:18,400 --> 00:14:20,370
Not anymore.

328
00:14:20,370 --> 00:14:21,870
You've all shown his calm side.

329
00:14:21,870 --> 00:14:24,380
But there's a wild side lurking within.

330
00:14:24,380 --> 00:14:27,040
But there's a wild side lurking within.

331
00:14:31,380 --> 00:14:33,750
You might not use it all the time, but you'll definitely use it.

332
00:14:33,750 --> 00:14:34,990
Please put it on.

333
00:14:34,650 --> 00:14:36,020
Wild.

334
00:14:36,890 --> 00:14:38,760
It's a little on the different side

335
00:14:37,360 --> 00:14:41,490
5,292 Yen (£30/$49)

336
00:14:38,760 --> 00:14:41,660
and you might not always wear it but

337
00:14:41,660 --> 00:14:44,900
I think this colour palette suits you perfectly.

338
00:14:45,200 --> 00:14:47,470
You definitely don't hate that colour right?

339
00:14:46,500 --> 00:14:47,870
Hmm, I do like it.

340
00:14:47,870 --> 00:14:50,370
Try it on.

341
00:14:50,570 --> 00:14:53,140
It really suits you!

342
00:14:54,810 --> 00:14:57,380
It really suits you!

343
00:14:58,040 --> 00:14:58,440
Wold you shut up already!!

344
00:14:58,440 --> 00:15:00,240
Wold you shut up already!!

345
00:15:00,240 --> 00:15:01,580
Let the guest say something.

346
00:15:01,580 --> 00:15:03,010
It looks great!

347
00:15:03,010 --> 00:15:04,780
Could you imagine him showing up on set
saying "Good morning" wearing that?

348
00:15:04,780 --> 00:15:06,680
Could you imagine him showing up on set
saying "Good morning" wearing that?

349
00:15:06,680 --> 00:15:10,590
I definitely couldn't.

350
00:15:09,290 --> 00:15:11,720
He said it pretty clearly.

351
00:15:14,130 --> 00:15:18,300
Next is Tanaka, can he get revenge for earlier.

352
00:15:18,300 --> 00:15:20,400
So far everyone's gone for the same style.

353
00:15:20,130 --> 00:15:24,140
Endō

354
00:15:20,130 --> 00:15:24,140
Hamada

355
00:15:20,130 --> 00:15:24,140
Matsumoto

356
00:15:20,400 --> 00:15:24,140
That's true. I think that style fits him pretty well.

357
00:15:24,500 --> 00:15:25,570
Please.

358
00:15:26,140 --> 00:15:28,110
What's that.

359
00:15:28,670 --> 00:15:32,710
He's just bought swim shorts instead.

360
00:15:33,340 --> 00:15:38,150
What sort of bag is that? Is there a celebration cake in there?

361
00:15:39,080 --> 00:15:40,150
He's laughing.

362
00:15:40,150 --> 00:15:43,390
He's got no choice but to laugh.

363
00:15:43,890 --> 00:15:45,390
What am I looking at?

364
00:15:46,060 --> 00:15:47,390
Why?

365
00:15:48,280 --> 00:15:49,890
Are you kidding?!

366
00:15:49,860 --> 00:15:53,500
3,132 Yen (£18/$29)

367
00:15:49,890 --> 00:15:51,800
Stop messing around!!

368
00:15:53,760 --> 00:15:55,070
I'm not messing around.

369
00:15:55,070 --> 00:15:57,070
You are just messing around!

370
00:15:56,230 --> 00:15:57,070
I'm really not.

371
00:15:57,070 --> 00:16:02,640
Look at all of ours, they're all pretty similar just in differing colours.

372
00:15:58,800 --> 00:16:02,640
Endō

373
00:15:58,800 --> 00:16:02,640
Hamada

374
00:15:58,800 --> 00:16:02,640
Matsumoto

375
00:16:02,770 --> 00:16:05,040
These are not messing around.

376
00:16:05,040 --> 00:16:06,940
Then, look at yours!

377
00:16:06,940 --> 00:16:07,480
Yes, but...

378
00:16:07,480 --> 00:16:08,710
Everyone's told you to stop messing around.

379
00:16:08,710 --> 00:16:11,220
Everyone's told you to stop messing around.

380
00:16:10,240 --> 00:16:11,220
I'm not.

381
00:16:11,480 --> 00:16:13,320
I'm really being serious.

382
00:16:13,320 --> 00:16:14,020
This feels like a new form of bungee.

383
00:16:14,020 --> 00:16:18,860
This feels like a new form of bungee.

384
00:16:18,860 --> 00:16:20,990
Wait a minute, I'm really trying hard here!

385
00:16:20,990 --> 00:16:22,490
Mikihisa, can you put it on?

386
00:16:22,490 --> 00:16:24,100
Yes, please try it on.

387
00:16:24,100 --> 00:16:25,560
You think this'll suit me?

388
00:16:24,900 --> 00:16:25,560
Yes!

389
00:16:25,560 --> 00:16:27,770
With the fake fur knitted on...

390
00:16:27,770 --> 00:16:29,770
I can see the knitted look.

391
00:16:28,730 --> 00:16:30,670
Yeah, with that image in mind...

392
00:16:30,670 --> 00:16:31,540
I tried to go that extra step.

393
00:16:31,540 --> 00:16:34,540
I tried to go that extra step.

394
00:16:32,740 --> 00:16:36,210
Why are 'you' trying to go the extra step.

395
00:16:36,810 --> 00:16:38,380
Just try a little bit.

396
00:16:38,140 --> 00:16:39,810
I...

397
00:16:39,810 --> 00:16:41,810
There he goes messing around again.

398
00:16:41,250 --> 00:16:42,350
What do you think?

399
00:16:42,350 --> 00:16:44,150
Don't you think it really suits you?

400
00:16:44,150 --> 00:16:46,150
Try lifting it up a little.

401
00:16:46,780 --> 00:16:48,150
Ah, it covers the ears?

402
00:16:48,150 --> 00:16:50,150
Yes yes.

403
00:16:50,290 --> 00:16:53,320
Try lifting up the front a bit.

404
00:16:53,990 --> 00:16:57,860
See, lifting the front... and you can also lift this back bit.

405
00:16:57,860 --> 00:17:00,700
Don't you think it really suits you Mikihisa-san?

406
00:17:02,570 --> 00:17:06,840
Last up to present his hat to Mikihisa is Hōsei.

407
00:17:12,780 --> 00:17:15,280
Hōsei-san, you went with this.

408
00:17:18,350 --> 00:17:24,160
7,776 Yen (£45/$72)

409
00:17:21,420 --> 00:17:23,820
Wait a sec... What's the imagery?

410
00:17:23,820 --> 00:17:27,630
Isn't it great. It's a kind of modern look.

411
00:17:27,630 --> 00:17:30,730
We haven't seen anything like this yet.

412
00:17:30,900 --> 00:17:32,160
That's right.

413
00:17:31,430 --> 00:17:32,900
Surprisingly...

414
00:17:34,770 --> 00:17:36,970
It actually looks quite stylish.

415
00:17:37,230 --> 00:17:38,900
Doesn't it look a little too big?

416
00:17:39,370 --> 00:17:40,640
No, it's not big at all.

417
00:17:40,640 --> 00:17:43,640
Is it supposed to have this height to it?

418
00:17:41,940 --> 00:17:43,640
Yes, yes.

419
00:17:44,380 --> 00:17:47,280
His face kind of betrays how he feels.

420
00:17:47,950 --> 00:17:50,050
'Is this alright?'

421
00:17:50,480 --> 00:17:52,880
It looks like he might pull out a dove at any moment.

422
00:17:54,450 --> 00:17:58,890
Which of these will be Mikihisa's favourite!?

423
00:17:58,910 --> 00:18:00,890
I'm pretty confident in mine.

424
00:18:00,120 --> 00:18:01,330
In first is...

425
00:18:01,330 --> 00:18:02,730
...this.

426
00:18:03,090 --> 00:18:04,860
Really?

427
00:18:03,930 --> 00:18:05,260
Of course it is.

428
00:18:05,260 --> 00:18:06,960
Sorry, but can you explain why.

429
00:18:06,960 --> 00:18:09,770
It was a close fight, but I like the colours on this one.

430
00:18:10,570 --> 00:18:12,000
In second place

431
00:18:12,000 --> 00:18:15,240
Matsumoto's leopard print hat.

432
00:18:17,510 --> 00:18:18,380
And in third is Endō's white hat.

433
00:18:18,380 --> 00:18:21,650
And in third is Endō's white hat.

434
00:18:21,980 --> 00:18:23,250
I don't have anything like this.

435
00:18:24,150 --> 00:18:28,250
So, which of these will come in last place!?

436
00:18:28,320 --> 00:18:30,250
Again, the same last two.

437
00:18:30,270 --> 00:18:32,250
So, in fourth is...?

438
00:18:32,250 --> 00:18:34,250
Well that's a given.

439
00:18:35,160 --> 00:18:36,490
That was a quick decision.

440
00:18:37,190 --> 00:18:38,760
What are your thoughts on this?

441
00:18:38,130 --> 00:18:40,530
I can't think of a time when I'd wear this.

442
00:18:41,430 --> 00:18:43,170
Tanaka, do you need a change of manager?

443
00:18:43,170 --> 00:18:45,400
Are things not going well? Are they giving you duff info.

444
00:18:45,400 --> 00:18:48,740
Are things not going well? Are they giving you duff info.

445
00:18:47,100 --> 00:18:49,840
Things are being done properly.

446
00:18:49,840 --> 00:18:52,910
Are they telling you like... you need to mess around on this one.

447
00:18:52,910 --> 00:18:56,080
No, they've told me properly and I tried hard.

448
00:18:56,750 --> 00:19:00,920
Tanaka has to pay out 3,132 Yen (£18/$29)!!

449
00:19:01,650 --> 00:19:06,320
Next up is an accessory. Hamada is first up.

450
00:19:06,320 --> 00:19:10,330
This is also something I thought you might not have.

451
00:19:09,360 --> 00:19:10,320
Ah, Beams.

452
00:19:12,760 --> 00:19:15,530
This is only for certain times of year.

453
00:19:14,930 --> 00:19:16,800
Ah, so it's seasonal.

454
00:19:22,810 --> 00:19:26,880
9,180 Yen (£53/$85)

455
00:19:23,360 --> 00:19:26,880
You put this over your head rather than around the neck.

456
00:19:25,880 --> 00:19:26,880
Ah, it's a scarf.

457
00:19:26,880 --> 00:19:28,880
Will that suit him?

458
00:19:28,010 --> 00:19:29,550
It's pretty different.

459
00:19:29,280 --> 00:19:30,410
No no no.

460
00:19:30,480 --> 00:19:32,520
It's got a jagged pattern.

461
00:19:32,520 --> 00:19:35,220
Put it on!!

462
00:19:36,190 --> 00:19:38,420
This is all planned.

463
00:19:38,420 --> 00:19:41,660
They had a meeting before this.

464
00:19:42,460 --> 00:19:43,660
It fell flat.

465
00:19:43,660 --> 00:19:46,760
Every time he takes forever.

466
00:19:46,760 --> 00:19:50,030
See, it sits right on the neck.

467
00:19:50,240 --> 00:19:52,000
It's much simpler.

468
00:19:52,640 --> 00:19:54,970
It's much easier than wrapping a scarf around.

469
00:19:54,340 --> 00:19:54,970
It's convenient.

470
00:19:55,410 --> 00:19:59,610
Next is Endō, what will his accessory be?

471
00:19:59,980 --> 00:20:01,380
Is it a coat?

472
00:20:04,650 --> 00:20:06,150
A bag.

473
00:20:05,180 --> 00:20:07,820
A bag with a cool design.

474
00:20:05,550 --> 00:20:10,850
12,960 Yen (£74/$120)

475
00:20:07,820 --> 00:20:09,790
That's an impressive amount of skulls.

476
00:20:09,790 --> 00:20:11,950
There's loads of skulls.

477
00:20:11,190 --> 00:20:12,860
You sure love skulls.

478
00:20:13,390 --> 00:20:17,490
Third up is Hōsei, can he challenge with his accessory?

479
00:20:18,060 --> 00:20:19,630
Well...

480
00:20:19,630 --> 00:20:21,600
...this is certainly something.

481
00:20:21,600 --> 00:20:23,070
It's a thong.

482
00:20:22,380 --> 00:20:23,070
A thong?

483
00:20:23,230 --> 00:20:27,070
1,327 Yen (£8/$12)

484
00:20:23,530 --> 00:20:26,300
This is impossible.

485
00:20:24,740 --> 00:20:26,300
He's taking you for a fool.

486
00:20:27,200 --> 00:20:28,670
When would I wear this?

487
00:20:28,670 --> 00:20:29,610
For a date.

488
00:20:29,610 --> 00:20:32,040
With a lady?

489
00:20:32,110 --> 00:20:33,140
If I were a woman, I'd be so pleased to see you in this.

490
00:20:33,140 --> 00:20:36,680
If I were a woman, I'd be so pleased to see you in this.

491
00:20:43,050 --> 00:20:47,930
Will Matsumoto's selected item suit Mikihisa?

492
00:20:48,000 --> 00:20:51,800
I was thinking 'What would he enjoy?' when I picked this out.

493
00:20:51,800 --> 00:20:53,130
What? This looks bad.

494
00:20:55,500 --> 00:20:57,470
He can't help but laugh.

495
00:20:57,100 --> 00:20:58,100
Nah, it's fine.

496
00:20:58,100 --> 00:21:00,640
It's just that it's such a unique item.

497
00:21:00,700 --> 00:21:01,770
What's wrong?

498
00:21:02,640 --> 00:21:07,310
9,504 Yen (£55/$88)

499
00:21:03,770 --> 00:21:05,440
You're joking right?

500
00:21:05,440 --> 00:21:07,310
What even is that?

501
00:21:07,880 --> 00:21:09,750
What is that?

502
00:21:09,750 --> 00:21:11,180
It suits him perfectly.

503
00:21:12,650 --> 00:21:16,690
I never imagined wearing something like this.

504
00:21:17,520 --> 00:21:19,760
They look great.

505
00:21:19,760 --> 00:21:21,130
Look at his face though.

506
00:21:21,130 --> 00:21:23,590
As I thought, they suit you so well.

507
00:21:24,430 --> 00:21:27,770
This is the first time I've worn fingerless gloves.

508
00:21:27,770 --> 00:21:31,040
Perfect when reading a script.

509
00:21:30,230 --> 00:21:32,100
Rather aren't your fingers gonna get cold.

510
00:21:32,100 --> 00:21:34,410
You can quickly flip to the previous scene.

511
00:21:34,410 --> 00:21:34,970
Like this.

512
00:21:34,970 --> 00:21:37,340
They seem pointless.

513
00:21:37,340 --> 00:21:39,340
You don't have anything like this right?

514
00:21:38,210 --> 00:21:40,610
I don't.

515
00:21:40,610 --> 00:21:42,610
He 'still' won't.

516
00:21:44,210 --> 00:21:48,450
Finally, with two losses already, Tanaka.

517
00:21:48,880 --> 00:21:51,420
Please, I'm really hoping for a win with this.

518
00:21:54,630 --> 00:21:56,060
Just look at that face!

519
00:21:58,410 --> 00:22:01,000
You won't have anything like this.

520
00:22:04,190 --> 00:22:04,870
What is it?

521
00:22:04,870 --> 00:22:05,600
A poncho?

522
00:22:05,440 --> 00:22:07,240
It's a rain poncho.

523
00:22:06,200 --> 00:22:09,070
9,612 Yen (£55/$89)

524
00:22:09,070 --> 00:22:11,910
Can you ever imagine Mikihisa-san wearing that?

525
00:22:12,010 --> 00:22:14,310
A rain poncho, it's the first I've heard of it.

526
00:22:14,010 --> 00:22:14,780
Right!

527
00:22:14,780 --> 00:22:16,780
That's exactly why it's great!

528
00:22:17,410 --> 00:22:19,880
You've never worn anything like it before.

529
00:22:19,880 --> 00:22:22,190
I'm not really sure what this is for.

530
00:22:22,190 --> 00:22:23,620
For rain or snow!

531
00:22:23,620 --> 00:22:25,420
Instead of an umbrella!

532
00:22:24,560 --> 00:22:26,990
Nah, you'd just carry an umbrella.

533
00:22:26,990 --> 00:22:28,990
Yeah, I'd just use an umbrella.

534
00:22:27,830 --> 00:22:29,860
And you'd just hop in a car.

535
00:22:29,880 --> 00:22:33,300
I mean, if you were camping and it suddenly rained...

536
00:22:31,530 --> 00:22:33,300
Yeah yeah yeah!

537
00:22:33,300 --> 00:22:35,470
But I bet he doesn't really go camping.

538
00:22:34,230 --> 00:22:35,530
Probably not.

539
00:22:34,870 --> 00:22:36,430
He doesn't have that image.

540
00:22:35,530 --> 00:22:38,570
Maybe a festival or something.

541
00:22:38,570 --> 00:22:41,000
You see him going to a festival in the rain?

542
00:22:40,640 --> 00:22:41,510
A festival?

543
00:22:42,370 --> 00:22:45,540
Would festival goers really wear a poncho like that?

544
00:22:47,610 --> 00:22:51,680
So, which of these will be Mikihisa's favourite item!?

545
00:22:52,120 --> 00:22:53,020
First is obviously... this.

546
00:22:53,020 --> 00:22:53,620
First is obviously... this.

547
00:22:53,380 --> 00:22:54,620
Thank you.

548
00:22:55,950 --> 00:22:59,120
As long as it's the right season, this can be used anywhere.

549
00:22:59,260 --> 00:23:00,820
And in second is... Hōsei's thong.

550
00:23:00,820 --> 00:23:02,930
And in second is... Hōsei's thong.

551
00:23:03,190 --> 00:23:04,800
See!!

552
00:23:06,360 --> 00:23:07,560
In third is... Endō's bag.

553
00:23:07,560 --> 00:23:09,670
In third is... Endō's bag.

554
00:23:10,170 --> 00:23:13,040
To be honest, I didn't think it'd lose to those two.

555
00:23:13,500 --> 00:23:18,010
So, which will be the worst accessory between these!?

556
00:23:18,110 --> 00:23:20,040
The worst is...?

557
00:23:20,040 --> 00:23:20,810
The worst is... this.

558
00:23:20,810 --> 00:23:22,310
The worst is... this.

559
00:23:24,580 --> 00:23:26,780
Of course it is!

560
00:23:28,890 --> 00:23:30,650
I thought so too.

561
00:23:31,720 --> 00:23:35,060
You must be joking!

562
00:23:35,290 --> 00:23:36,860
Really?!

563
00:23:36,860 --> 00:23:38,760
Of course it is.

564
00:23:38,760 --> 00:23:39,600
I'm still not sure what these are.

565
00:23:39,600 --> 00:23:41,270
I'm still not sure what these are.

566
00:23:42,100 --> 00:23:46,270
Matsumoto has to pay out 9,504 Yen (£55/$88)!!

567
00:23:46,300 --> 00:23:48,610
So, Matsumoto-san, how do you feel?

568
00:23:48,610 --> 00:23:50,770
Shall we continue this series?

569
00:23:50,810 --> 00:23:53,180
I've realised after this episode...

570
00:23:53,180 --> 00:23:55,710
...that I'd like to replace Tanaka with a new regular.

571
00:23:59,020 --> 00:24:00,680
You just mess around.

572
00:24:00,680 --> 00:24:03,190
Take a peek in their dressing room next time.
