Well, you've done well enough.

30
00:01:14,620 --> 00:01:16,220
Did you really think the white team can win?

31
00:01:17,220 --> 00:01:19,220
Uh, yeah. That's what I thought...

32
00:01:19,620 --> 00:01:21,820
Are you reading the trend of time?

33
00:01:22,820 --> 00:01:26,220
Well, I didn't think that deeply to say for the white team..

34
00:01:26,420 --> 00:01:29,620
Can you read it? Can you?

35
00:01:29,620 --> 00:01:32,220
The fact that the white team lost makes I couldn't.

36
00:01:32,220 --> 00:01:33,220
Yeah, that's right.

37
00:01:33,220 --> 00:01:37,620

00:01:38,020 --> 00:01:39,420
Tell him my number.

00:01:39,420 --> 00:01:41,220
Ok, your phone number...

40
00:01:41,220 --> 00:01:44,020
Should I give him the office number instead? It'd bad if he gotten your phone number.

41
00:01:44,020 --> 00:01:47,420
You're right! He's gonna prank me.

What's wrong?

44
00:01:55,820 --> 00:01:56,820
I can't find my mechanical pencil.

45
00:01:58,220 --> 00:02:01,020
No, no, that won't do. I need my mechanical pencil, I cannot write with that.

46
00:02:01,020 --> 00:02:02,820
Cannot write with that!? Sure you can!

47
00:02:04,020 --> 00:02:06,020
Where did it go...?

48
00:02:06,220 --> 00:02:09,420
Ah! I remember it now!

49
00:02:09,420 --> 00:02:13,020
Mr. Sakamoto borrowed it from me!

Go fetch it!

Go to New York and fetch my mechanical pencil from Mr. Sakamoto!!

Batsu Game: Hama-chan goes to New York to fetch a mechanical pencil!!

Immediately and forcibly, after his first batsu game that took place in foreign country, "Hamada's journey to France for Evian water"

60
00:02:47,300 --> 00:02:49,100
He now has to do another one!

00:03:06,820 --> 00:03:12,900
Suga Kenji

69
00:03:06,820 --> 00:03:12,900
There! Popular producer figure, Suga! By the order from Matsumoto, he'll now act as the saboteur!

70
00:03:13,500 --> 00:03:14,300
What is it?

71
00:03:15,620 --> 00:03:16,300
What are you doing here?

72
00:03:17,820 --> 00:03:18,300
Is he on vacation?

73
00:03:19,300 --> 00:03:19,900
That's right.

74
00:03:20,300 --> 00:03:23,300
I'm going to visit New York for a week, then I go to Bahamas.

75
00:03:23,300 --> 00:03:24,900
Well, What are you doing here?

Don't "What are you doing here" me! I'm on Batsu Game!

77
00:03:26,900 --> 00:03:29,100
Ah, I've heard of it.

78
00:03:29,100 --> 00:03:29,900

Shut up.

82
00:03:35,300 --> 00:03:37,300
This whole thing is lame...

83
00:03:37,300 --> 00:03:41,300

00:03:42,700 --> 00:03:46,700
Plane that Hamada is on board now left for New York...

85
00:03:46,700 --> 00:03:48,900
Of course, Economy class for Batsu Game.

00:03:49,100 --> 00:03:51,300
Shimizu, where's Suga, huh?

87
00:03:53,300 --> 00:03:55,300
I think he's at at the front seat.

88
00:03:55,300 --> 00:03:56,100
Front seat?

89
00:03:56,900 --> 00:03:58,300
What do you mean front?

90
00:03:58,300 --> 00:03:59,500
Front all the way.

91
00:04:00,900 --> 00:04:05,300
So he makes actors sit on economy class but not himself.

92
00:04:18,700 --> 00:04:19,300
Hey.

93
00:04:20,100 --> 00:04:22,620
Producer Sugawara is relaxing in business class.

94
00:04:22,900 --> 00:04:28,300
I'm on economy class, goddamit! Why are you in business class?

95
00:04:28,500 --> 00:04:34,300
Hey, He's drinking cognac! Disgusting fellow!

96
00:04:34,300 --> 00:04:35,900
With all these swing, he couldn't sleep at all!

97

It's literally the worst... I'm so tired...

Hamada is now en route for Sakamoto's house!

106
00:04:59,700 --> 00:05:03,500
Argh, why the white team lost?

107
00:05:04,700 --> 00:05:06,500
Are you reading the trend of time?

108
00:05:10,500 --> 00:05:12,820
Note: Amagasaki is the hometown for Downtown.

109
00:05:10,500 --> 00:05:12,820
Shit, Amagasaki has developed a lot...

110
00:05:12,820 --> 00:05:13,300
No, this isn't...

No, we're going to Kyoju's house! Let's hurry up!

115
00:05:25,700 --> 00:05:31,300
Note: Ryuichi Sakamoto is called as "Kyoju", which means professor, named by his friend and musician Yukihiro Takahasi for he knew lots of knowledge and theory about music.

116
00:05:33,900 --> 00:05:38,020
Suga's sabotage scheme has started!

117
00:05:34,300 --> 00:05:34,900
Where are you going?

118
00:05:35,820 --> 00:05:36,500
Where are you going?

119
00:05:37,700 --> 00:05:38,500
Kyoju's place's there!

120
00:05:38,500 --> 00:05:39,300
Don't worry about it!

121
00:05:41,300 --> 00:05:42,900
Wait, where is this?

122
00:05:43,100 --> 00:05:46,500
Empire State Building

123
00:05:43,500 --> 00:05:46,500
It's the symbol of Manhattan, Empire State Building!

124
00:05:46,500 --> 00:05:50,700
An unwanted stop for Hamada!

125
00:05:50,700 --> 00:05:52,900
It's so cold here.

126
00:05:54,900 --> 00:05:56,300
So cold, wow...

127
00:05:56,300 --> 00:05:57,100
Oh shit It's cold!

128
00:05:58,300 --> 00:05:59,620
But the view from here is good...

129
00:06:01,300 --> 00:06:03,700
It's impressive...

130
00:06:04,100 --> 00:06:04,900
Let's take a picture.

131
00:06:04,900 --> 00:06:05,700
Huh?

132
00:06:06,300 --> 00:06:07,020
Picture?

133
00:06:09,820 --> 00:06:10,500
Why?

134
00:06:11,220 --> 00:06:12,100
Why the hell?

135
00:06:12,100 --> 00:06:12,900
Why not? It's famous here.

136
00:06:15,300 --> 00:06:17,900
That's it, good, good, it's so cool!

137
00:06:17,900 --> 00:06:18,900
No, it's hella lame!

138
00:06:22,500 --> 00:06:28,900
By punching a one cent coin, it can make pendant with

139
00:06:22,500 --> 00:06:28,900
Popular in Empire State Building

140
00:06:22,500 --> 00:06:28,900
the design of building.

141
00:06:22,700 --> 00:06:26,300
Moreover, Hamada is forced to buy unwanted coin!

142
00:06:26,700 --> 00:06:29,300
What the hell is this!? It's so lame!

143
00:06:30,700 --> 00:06:31,700
Why don't we just leave?

144
00:06:31,700 --> 00:06:34,700
Ok, next we'll go skating.

145
00:06:34,700 --> 00:06:35,900
Don't be an idiot.

146
00:06:36,900 --> 00:06:40,500
Rockefeller Center

147
00:06:37,100 --> 00:06:41,100
Another famous spot in New York, the skating rink in Rockefeller Center!

148
00:06:41,100 --> 00:06:42,300
Oh watch out, watch out...

149
00:06:47,500 --> 00:06:55,300
Hamada wants to go to Sakamoto's house, but he's dragged around for sightseeing!

150
00:06:56,100 --> 00:06:59,100
Times Square

151
00:06:56,900 --> 00:06:59,100
Next, for the center, Times Square!

152
00:06:59,100 --> 00:07:01,700
I must go to Kyoju's house!

153
00:07:00,020 --> 00:07:04,100
Hamada's irritating for late trip.

154
00:07:01,700 --> 00:07:04,300
We can do that tomorrow.

155
00:07:04,300 --> 00:07:05,700
No way! I have no time.

156
00:07:05,700 --> 00:07:06,700
There, a hot dog stand.

157
00:07:06,700 --> 00:07:07,700
Nevermind about the hot dog...

158
00:07:07,700 --> 00:07:09,500
"Nevermind about the hot dog..."

159
00:07:12,500 --> 00:07:14,700
Why don't we get one since we're already here...

160
00:07:15,020 --> 00:07:15,900
Hello...

161
00:07:16,500 --> 00:07:22,700
Hamada has no time for a hot dog. He's irritated, but...

162
00:07:23,420 --> 00:07:24,500
Hama-chan...!

163
00:07:24,820 --> 00:07:27,500
You don't have to take a picture!

164
00:07:27,500 --> 00:07:28,500
Eat it, eat it now...

165
00:07:33,300 --> 00:07:36,300
The city where many artists live, East Village!

166
00:07:33,300 --> 00:07:37,300
East Village

167
00:07:38,100 --> 00:07:41,500
21 hours since departure

168
00:07:38,700 --> 00:07:44,500
21 hours after they departed from Tokyo, they finally reached the apartment where Sakamoto Ryuichi lives!

169
00:07:45,100 --> 00:07:46,300
Oh, he's livin' in here...

170
00:07:46,300 --> 00:07:47,900
Or is this his office?

171
00:07:48,300 --> 00:07:50,700
I guess he's living in here, I don't know.

172
00:07:50,900 --> 00:07:52,900
Don't "I don't know" me!

173
00:07:52,900 --> 00:07:53,500
Who knows...

174
00:07:54,420 --> 00:07:58,300
Finally, reunification with Sakamoto Ryuichi after a long time!

175
00:08:06,300 --> 00:08:07,620
I hope he's here...

176
00:08:07,620 --> 00:08:10,100
Oh, Kyoju!

177
00:08:10,100 --> 00:08:10,700
Hello there!

178
00:08:10,500 --> 00:08:14,500
Sakamoto Ryuichi

179
00:08:12,300 --> 00:08:15,300
Well, I'm here because...Matsumoto's...

180
00:08:15,300 --> 00:08:16,300
Why are you here?

181
00:08:16,300 --> 00:08:17,100
No, um...

182
00:08:17,100 --> 00:08:18,100
I'm here to fetch something.

183
00:08:19,300 --> 00:08:21,700
Um, Matsumoto's...

184
00:08:22,020 --> 00:08:23,300
What's with that attitude!?

185
00:08:25,100 --> 00:08:28,700
I've come all the way from Tokyo, what's with that attitude!?

186
00:08:29,300 --> 00:08:30,900
Oh, is that it?

187
00:08:35,500 --> 00:08:39,900
Through Kyoju's hand, the machine pencil is warmly handed.

188
00:08:35,500 --> 00:08:42,300
Mechanical Pencil fetching success!!

189
00:08:40,100 --> 00:08:42,300
Batsu Game completes splendidly!

190
00:08:42,900 --> 00:08:44,500
Hey! Hey, Sakamoto!

191
00:08:46,100 --> 00:08:47,300
Hey, Sakamoto!

192
00:08:47,700 --> 00:08:48,700
Ryuichi!!

193
00:08:48,900 --> 00:08:49,900
Let's just go...

194
00:08:49,900 --> 00:08:51,700
No, no way that attitude is allowed!

195
00:08:51,700 --> 00:08:53,100
I can't go back like this!

196
00:08:53,500 --> 00:08:55,900
Let me have a talk with him!

197
00:08:56,900 --> 00:09:01,700
Anyway, you're so popular and exalted in Japan, but this is how it is here, huh?!

198
00:09:04,820 --> 00:09:07,300
It's fucking frustrating...

199
00:09:08,100 --> 00:09:09,900
Cold, cold...

200
00:09:09,900 --> 00:09:11,100
Go to airport now.

201
00:09:11,100 --> 00:09:13,100
Who? Oh, me?

202
00:09:13,500 --> 00:09:14,300
You're not coming?

203
00:09:14,300 --> 00:09:17,700
Well, no. I'm here for vacation. I told you earlier.

204
00:09:18,300 --> 00:09:21,300
Ah, right. Then, later.

205
00:09:23,100 --> 00:09:24,700
Ugh, this is the worst...

206
00:09:24,900 --> 00:09:26,300
Bye, Hama-chan...

207
00:09:29,100 --> 00:09:33,300
23 hours since departure

208
00:09:29,100 --> 00:09:33,300
Hamada is now with the pencil, to Japan where Matsumoto is waiting!

209
00:09:29,100 --> 00:09:33,300
Pencil's fetched. Hamada is off from New York.

210
00:09:34,940 --> 00:09:37,940
Board room

211
00:09:35,340 --> 00:09:36,140
Second time...

212
00:09:38,340 --> 00:09:39,340
The one we went through?

213
00:09:42,140 --> 00:09:42,940
Ugh!!

Ughhh!!!

218
00:09:48,340 --> 00:09:49,740
It can't be helped, man...Fetchin...

219
00:09:49,140 --> 00:09:49,540
Here.

220
00:09:49,740 --> 00:09:51,340
Yeah, that's right, this is it.

221
00:09:51,340 --> 00:09:52,940
Is that it? Finally!

222
00:09:53,340 --> 00:09:55,540
I mean, it's even got my name "Matsumoto" written here.

223
00:09:55,940 --> 00:09:58,740
Suga kept getting in my way and slowing me down...

224
00:09:59,140 --> 00:10:01,740
Well, this is over now, it doesn't matter anymore.

225
00:10:02,740 --> 00:10:04,140
It was so cold too...

226
00:10:06,140 --> 00:10:07,740
Ahhhhhh!!!!!

227
00:10:10,540 --> 00:10:14,740
23 hours since departure

228
00:10:10,540 --> 00:10:14,740
Hamada is now with the pencil, to Japan where Matsumoto is waiting!

229
00:10:10,540 --> 00:10:14,740

Second time...

232
00:10:19,780 --> 00:10:20,780
The one we went through?

233
00:10:23,580 --> 00:10:24,380
Ugh!!

Ughhh!!!

238
00:10:29,780 --> 00:10:31,180
It can't be helped, man...Fetchin...

239
00:10:30,580 --> 00:10:30,980
Here.

240
00:10:31,180 --> 00:10:32,780
Yeah, that's right, this is it.

241
00:10:32,780 --> 00:10:34,380
Is that it? Finally!

242
00:10:34,780 --> 00:10:36,980
I mean, it's even got my name "Matsumoto" written here.

243
00:10:37,380 --> 00:10:40,180
Suga kept getting in my way and slowing me down...

244
00:10:40,580 --> 00:10:43,180
Well, this is over now, it doesn't matter anymore.

245
00:10:44,180 --> 00:10:45,580
It was so cold too...

246
00:10:47,580 --> 00:10:49,180
Ahhhhhh!!!!!

247
00:10:52,980 --> 00:10:53,980
The eraser is missing!

248
00:10:54,980 --> 00:10:57,180
Really? What's up with this?

249
00:10:57,180 --> 00:11:00,980
Wait a second, calm down, what eraser are you talking about?

250
00:11:00,980 --> 00:11:04,380
Well, it doesn't matter anymore since I already fetched this for you...

251
00:11:05,780 --> 00:11:06,780
What are you doing?

252
00:11:06,780 --> 00:11:07,980
I'm gonna call Mr. Sakamoto...

253
00:11:07,980 --> 00:11:08,780
Who cares about this anymore!

254
00:11:09,780 --> 00:11:13,980
I already went there and did the Batsu Game, it was so tiring and all.

255
00:11:13,980 --> 00:11:14,580
Um, hello?

256
00:11:14,780 --> 00:11:15,300
Yes?

257
00:11:15,580 --> 00:11:16,180
Hello?

258
00:11:16,180 --> 00:11:16,980
Yes, hello.

259
00:11:16,980 --> 00:11:17,980
Is this Kyoju?

260
00:11:17,980 --> 00:11:18,780
Yes, this is him.

261
00:11:18,780 --> 00:11:19,980
Ah, good morning.

262
00:11:18,780 --> 00:11:38,580
On the phone

263
00:11:18,780 --> 00:11:38,580
Sakamoto Ryuichi

264
00:11:19,980 --> 00:11:20,780
Good morning.

265
00:11:20,780 --> 00:11:21,780
This is Matsumoto speaking...

266
00:11:21,780 --> 00:11:22,780
Oh, nice to hear you.

267
00:11:22,780 --> 00:11:23,780
Same here...

268
00:11:23,780 --> 00:11:24,780
I have just noticed this, but...

269
00:11:24,780 --> 00:11:25,380
Yes?

270
00:11:25,380 --> 00:11:27,580
I couldn't find the eraser that was with it...

271
00:11:28,380 --> 00:11:30,980
Um, it was left behind...

272
00:11:32,780 --> 00:11:33,780
Where was it...

273
00:11:36,300 --> 00:11:37,180
Here, ah!

274
00:11:37,580 --> 00:11:39,180
D-Did you just find it?

275
00:11:42,580 --> 00:11:44,980
Why don't you go fetch it?

276
00:11:47,380 --> 00:11:51,780
Batsu Game: Hama-chan goes to New York to fetch an eraser!!

277
00:11:52,500 --> 00:11:56,380
New York once again...

278
00:11:52,500 --> 00:11:56,380
Plane that Hamada is on board now left for

279
00:11:58,580 --> 00:12:03,780
Manhattan

280
00:11:59,180 --> 00:12:03,780
Manhattan, New York. A long time no see city welcomes Hamada!

281
00:12:04,980 --> 00:12:09,580
56 hours since the first departure

282
00:12:11,180 --> 00:12:11,980
Huh?

283
00:12:11,980 --> 00:12:13,380
W-Wait...Stop, stop!

284
00:12:14,580 --> 00:12:15,980
Is that Suga-chan...?

285
00:12:17,780 --> 00:12:19,780
I hate this kind of setup...

286
00:12:21,180 --> 00:12:23,980
Stop setting up these coincidental meet-ups already!

287
00:12:25,980 --> 00:12:27,980
Ugh, here I am again...

288
00:12:30,780 --> 00:12:34,380
I just want to go to Kyoju's house...

289
00:12:38,180 --> 00:12:38,980
Hey!!

290
00:12:40,780 --> 00:12:41,780
What?

291
00:12:41,780 --> 00:12:43,780
Don't be saying "What?" to me again!

292
00:12:43,780 --> 00:12:46,180
Ugh...I'm so...

293
00:12:46,180 --> 00:12:46,980
What now?

294
00:12:46,980 --> 00:12:49,580
When I went home, he asked me to come back and fetch his eraser this time...

295
00:12:49,580 --> 00:12:50,780
What do you mean?

296
00:12:50,780 --> 00:12:52,380
I have to go to Kyoju's place again!

297
00:12:52,380 --> 00:12:53,780
Let's go together again!

298
00:12:53,780 --> 00:12:55,780
Don't make me take detours again this time!

299
00:12:56,980 --> 00:12:57,580
Look, I ha-

300
00:12:57,580 --> 00:12:58,180
And I se-

301
00:12:58,180 --> 00:13:00,380
What the hell is your outfit!?

302
00:13:00,380 --> 00:13:01,780
Let's just go! Man!

303
00:13:02,380 --> 00:13:04,380
Anyway, I'm already so mad now!

304
00:13:04,780 --> 00:13:07,700
A reunion with Producer Suga after a long time!

305
00:13:07,700 --> 00:13:10,180
Another Times Square after two days!

306
00:13:07,700 --> 00:13:10,700
Times Square

307
00:13:10,980 --> 00:13:12,380
Why are you here again?

308
00:13:12,380 --> 00:13:13,980
Don't be asking me that again...

309
00:13:14,180 --> 00:13:17,380
Like I told you earlier, I'm here to fetch the eraser!

310
00:13:21,180 --> 00:13:22,780
Let's eat hot dogs.

311
00:13:23,580 --> 00:13:24,180
Y'know...

312
00:13:24,180 --> 00:13:24,980
Yeah?

313
00:13:24,980 --> 00:13:26,980
Haven't we been here before?

314
00:13:26,980 --> 00:13:27,780
Oh, is that so?

315
00:13:27,780 --> 00:13:29,580
It's the same place and the same guy!

316
00:13:29,580 --> 00:13:32,180
It's always good to visit New York again after a long time, huh?

317
00:13:32,180 --> 00:13:33,580
I ain't visiting here "after a long time"!

318
00:13:36,980 --> 00:13:39,780
It's ok, but let's just hurry up on the eraser.

319
00:13:40,180 --> 00:13:42,180
Ah, that won't be any good.

320
00:13:42,180 --> 00:13:43,780
Have you done any shopping here?

321
00:13:43,780 --> 00:13:44,780
Shopping?!

322
00:13:44,780 --> 00:13:48,980
Of course not! I'm on a mission here! I didn't even get any souvenir.

323
00:13:48,980 --> 00:13:52,180
No problem! Let's just go shopping!

324
00:13:52,780 --> 00:13:54,180
Why the hell should we?

325
00:13:54,180 --> 00:13:57,180
C'mon, why not! Let's just go shopping for now!

326
00:13:58,100 --> 00:14:01,380
5th Avenue

327
00:13:58,180 --> 00:14:03,180
New York's 5th Avenue! So many world class boutiques are located here! Truly the Mecca of shopping!

328
00:14:06,180 --> 00:14:11,380
And of course, Hamada is dragged around town once again!

329
00:14:11,580 --> 00:14:14,980
East Village

330
00:14:12,380 --> 00:14:14,580
East Village after two days!

331
00:14:15,900 --> 00:14:20,300
59 hours since the first departure

332
00:14:16,580 --> 00:14:19,500
It is now has been 59 hours since the first departure from Japan!

333
00:14:19,500 --> 00:14:23,780
And the Batsu Game is finally reaching its climax!

334
00:14:23,780 --> 00:14:25,180
How is this also part of the Batsu Game?

335
00:14:25,180 --> 00:14:26,780
Since you lost that bet, can't be helped.

336
00:14:26,780 --> 00:14:29,580
Why must I do this again? That's what's annoying to me.

337
00:14:30,780 --> 00:14:32,380
Can't be helped.

338
00:14:32,580 --> 00:14:34,380
It's cold here!

339
00:14:35,980 --> 00:14:40,580
Another reunion with Sakamoto Ryuichi after 38 hours!

340
00:14:49,780 --> 00:14:51,180
I'm exhausted...

341
00:14:52,380 --> 00:14:52,980
Ah, Kyoju!

342
00:14:53,980 --> 00:14:55,180
The eraser?

343
00:14:57,900 --> 00:14:59,380
You're late...

344
00:15:00,300 --> 00:15:02,500
What do you mean we're late?

345
00:15:02,500 --> 00:15:03,500
W-Wait a second! Hey!

346
00:15:03,500 --> 00:15:04,180
Sakamoto!

347
00:15:06,300 --> 00:15:06,900
Is this it?

348
00:15:06,900 --> 00:15:09,580
Ah, yes. Sorry. That's what I came for.

349
00:15:12,580 --> 00:15:17,300
Through Kyoju's hand, the eraser is warmly handed, describing parabola.

350
00:15:12,780 --> 00:15:18,580
Eraser fetching success!!

351
00:15:17,300 --> 00:15:18,780
The Batsu Game is complete!

352
00:15:22,100 --> 00:15:24,300
It's so irritating...

353
00:15:24,780 --> 00:15:26,780
Let's go, you already got the eraser...

354
00:15:26,780 --> 00:15:28,780
That's how Grammy Awards change a man, huh?

355
00:15:28,780 --> 00:15:29,780
Alright then!

356
00:15:29,780 --> 00:15:31,380
I'll start making music tomorrow!

357
00:15:33,380 --> 00:15:36,380
I'm gonna challenge you! I'm gonna make music...

358
00:15:36,380 --> 00:15:38,580
I'll meet you again at the next Grammy Award ceremony!

359
00:15:39,900 --> 00:15:40,580
Farewell!!

360
00:15:42,380 --> 00:15:45,780
Eraser's fetched. Hamada is off from New York once again!

361
00:15:42,980 --> 00:15:45,780
And now, to Japan where Matsumoto awaits!

362
00:15:50,300 --> 00:15:51,180
Right?

363
00:15:50,300 --> 00:15:53,580
Board room

364
00:15:51,780 --> 00:15:52,380
Well, anyway...

365
00:15:55,500 --> 00:15:58,780
78 hours since the first departure

366
00:15:58,980 --> 00:15:59,580
Is this it!?

367
00:15:59,980 --> 00:16:01,780
Yeah! This is the one...

368
00:16:01,780 --> 00:16:05,180
Y'know...you should've checked for this eraser the first time.

369
00:16:05,780 --> 00:16:07,580
Now it's finally complete.

370
00:16:10,780 --> 00:16:12,380
Oh, I want Evian water too.

371
00:16:13,100 --> 00:16:13,980
Here you go then.

372
00:16:14,500 --> 00:16:15,780
No, not this one.

373
00:16:17,380 --> 00:16:17,980
Why not?

374
00:16:21,180 --> 00:16:23,180
Go over there.

375
00:16:25,100 --> 00:16:28,180
Go draw some Evian water in France.

376
00:16:28,900 --> 00:16:29,980
Gimme a break already!

377
00:16:38,780 --> 00:16:40,100
You should have gone to France.

378
00:16:40,100 --> 00:16:41,300
WHY!?

379
00:16:41,300 --> 00:16:43,380
Considering audience's reaction, it's so!

380
00:16:43,700 --> 00:16:45,580
Oh they are like "Oh he goes to France now?"...

381
00:16:46,180 --> 00:16:46,780
Right?

382
00:16:46,780 --> 00:16:49,180
Still, going to New York was really exhausting...

383
00:16:49,180 --> 00:16:50,700
I've heard that was tiring.

384
00:16:50,700 --> 00:16:52,180
Yeah, VERY TIRING!

385
00:16:52,380 --> 00:16:53,980
Moreover, you didn't have any sleep, right?

386
00:16:53,980 --> 00:16:55,380
Yeah, I just had to go back in a day!

387
00:16:55,380 --> 00:16:59,580
Well, you had to go through that because I experienced similar things.

388
00:16:59,580 --> 00:17:00,780
What's that?

389
00:17:01,180 --> 00:17:02,780
What similar thing?

390
00:17:02,900 --> 00:17:05,380
The next Batsu Game is already decided.

391
00:17:05,380 --> 00:17:06,180
Oh, really?

392
00:17:06,780 --> 00:17:07,580
What is it?

393
00:17:07,580 --> 00:17:08,980
Um...

394
00:17:08,980 --> 00:17:10,180
You go to the North Pole...

395
00:17:11,780 --> 00:17:14,380
...and become Coolmint gum.

396
00:17:16,980 --> 00:17:17,780
Penguin?

397
00:17:16,980 --> 00:17:19,580
Note: Reference from advertising from Coolmint gum, Lotte.

398
00:17:19,580 --> 00:17:22,180
I'm gonna sell that from Lotte.

399
00:17:24,180 --> 00:17:25,780
Like some kind of limited products.

400
00:17:26,100 --> 00:17:26,900
Well, well...

401
00:17:26,980 --> 00:17:31,900
When I was in the plane, there was a couple behind me.

402
00:17:32,380 --> 00:17:36,380
Then, the girl said to me "Can I have your autograph?".

403
00:17:36,580 --> 00:17:39,580
I said it's ok. I have nothing to do after all.

404
00:17:39,580 --> 00:17:43,580
She said, "I'm gonna take my clothes off". I was like, "Huh!?".

405
00:17:43,580 --> 00:17:49,980
She hand me her bra and said, "Sign to this".

406
00:17:51,380 --> 00:17:52,580
It's totally insane!

407
00:17:52,780 --> 00:17:54,380
It was so warm!

408
00:17:56,380 --> 00:17:59,180
I signed that warm bra...

409
00:18:01,180 --> 00:18:02,580
Don't smell it man, don't smell it...

410
00:18:04,980 --> 00:18:09,780
Also, I didn't eat anything on the plane home. Because I was too tired.

411
00:18:10,300 --> 00:18:10,780
No appetite.

412
00:18:10,780 --> 00:18:12,300
I didn't give a shit about food in the plane.

413
00:18:12,300 --> 00:18:13,380
I just wanted to sleep!

414
00:18:13,980 --> 00:18:17,780
When I was sleeping all the way, about 5 hours left,

415
00:18:17,780 --> 00:18:21,180
A foreigner cabin attendant who spoke Japanese very well came to me and said-

416
00:18:21,780 --> 00:18:25,380
"You didn't eat anything, right?". Then, I responded "Yeah.".

417
00:18:25,780 --> 00:18:30,780
"If you go back from foreign country and didn't eat anything-

418
00:18:30,780 --> 00:18:33,380
you'll be mistaken as a drug mule."

419
00:18:37,380 --> 00:18:38,180
Right, right...

420
00:18:38,180 --> 00:18:41,780
She said drug mules often don't eat anything and just go out!

421
00:18:42,180 --> 00:18:45,780
If they eat anything, drugs will go wrong.

422
00:18:46,380 --> 00:18:49,780
So they wrap drugs into plastic bag or something and swallow it-

423
00:18:49,980 --> 00:18:52,180
then they bring it to Japan.

424
00:18:52,180 --> 00:18:55,380
Since I haven't eaten anything, and just kept sleeping...

425
00:18:55,380 --> 00:19:01,980
Other foreign attendants kept looking at me when they pass by.

426
00:19:02,380 --> 00:19:06,780
She said "You are not a drug mule, aren't you?", I was like "Hell no!"

427
00:19:06,980 --> 00:19:09,780
Well, but...you were carrying drugs...
